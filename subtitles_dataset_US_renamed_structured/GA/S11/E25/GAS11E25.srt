1
00:00:01,869 --> 00:00:03,013
We need four units of O-neg.

2
00:00:03,037 --> 00:00:04,586
Bring that bench over here.

3
00:00:04,655 --> 00:00:05,895
They went to cut off the door,

4
00:00:05,923 --> 00:00:07,567
and all I could think was,
"He's gonna bleed out.

5
00:00:07,591 --> 00:00:08,785
"We need more time."

6
00:00:08,809 --> 00:00:10,236
I was pissed,
but then I thought,

7
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,189
"No, we need less
distance to the OR," so...

8
00:00:12,213 --> 00:00:13,907
So, you brought...
The whole damn car.

9
00:00:13,931 --> 00:00:14,975
Is he still alive?

10
00:00:14,999 --> 00:00:16,097
How is he?

11
00:00:16,166 --> 00:00:17,394
He's hanging on, barely.

12
00:00:17,418 --> 00:00:19,245
<i>I remember in school
someone telling me</i>

13
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:20,602
<i>I came from a broken home.</i>

14
00:00:20,671 --> 00:00:21,965
<i>That's what they used to call it</i>

15
00:00:21,989 --> 00:00:23,200
<i>when your parents got divorced.</i>

16
00:00:23,224 --> 00:00:24,884
This isn't the way
we usually do this.

17
00:00:24,908 --> 00:00:26,148
I had to do it this way.

18
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:27,653
No, no, no, we
see why you did it.

19
00:00:27,677 --> 00:00:29,728
Okay. Look, I just
wanted to give him...

20
00:00:29,797 --> 00:00:31,830
A second chance. We
got a second chance.

21
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:33,376
<i>Even though getting divorced</i>

22
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,977
<i>was the least broken
thing they ever did.</i>

23
00:00:35,001 --> 00:00:36,602
Hey, Keith, it's Meredith.

24
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:38,153
Thanks for having me over.

25
00:00:38,222 --> 00:00:39,988
How's Joan?

26
00:00:40,891 --> 00:00:42,574
What's the word on my baby?

27
00:00:42,643 --> 00:00:45,627
We'll find out for
you. We got you.

28
00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:50,415
<i>When I heard that as a kid,</i>

29
00:00:50,483 --> 00:00:53,585
<i>I wondered if broken homes
were where the broken people lived.</i>

30
00:00:53,654 --> 00:00:55,503
Still feeling those toes, Joan?

31
00:00:55,572 --> 00:00:57,012
Yeah. Good.

32
00:00:58,175 --> 00:00:59,524
Um, you guys, let's just stop.

33
00:00:59,593 --> 00:01:01,220
Let's stop for a sec.
What's happening?

34
00:01:01,244 --> 00:01:02,639
There's just a little bleeding,

35
00:01:02,663 --> 00:01:03,823
which is normal
after a delivery,

36
00:01:03,847 --> 00:01:05,125
but we're gonna
get you checked out

37
00:01:05,149 --> 00:01:07,193
before you have your
spinal surgery, okay?

38
00:01:07,217 --> 00:01:09,462
<i>It was silly. I mean,
I was just a little kid.</i>

39
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:11,464
We have to take her. No,
no, what are you doing?

40
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:12,549
What are you doing with my baby?

41
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:13,855
Just for now, while you...

42
00:01:13,923 --> 00:01:15,451
No, please! We
were crushed in a car!

43
00:01:15,475 --> 00:01:17,793
My fiance's dead!
You're not taking my baby!

44
00:01:17,862 --> 00:01:18,994
Please, no!

45
00:01:19,062 --> 00:01:20,139
Joan, your baby's
doing fine, okay?

46
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:21,725
Please! We just
need to check you out.

47
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:23,826
Okay, you need to take him
to the NICU and page Karev.

48
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:26,168
<i>But to this day, I still wonder.</i>

49
00:01:26,704 --> 00:01:28,203
No!

50
00:01:28,271 --> 00:01:30,049
It looks like uterine atony.
We need to move fast.

51
00:01:30,073 --> 00:01:31,540
We move fast, we paralyze her.

52
00:01:31,609 --> 00:01:34,109
We move too slow
and she bleeds to death.

53
00:01:35,278 --> 00:01:36,328
Okay.

54
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:44,870
Yeah, I already spoke to Mom.

55
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:46,171
Amelia.

56
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,606
I don't know how fast
you're moving on the house.

57
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:50,492
I haven't even accepted
an offer yet, so...

58
00:01:50,561 --> 00:01:52,706
I can have my stuff out next
week. Is that soon enough?

59
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:55,681
Ted, I don't care
whose side of the story.

60
00:01:55,749 --> 00:01:57,761
I'm not sure I can make it
any sooner. You don't have to.

61
00:01:57,785 --> 00:01:59,612
I should've been
out a while ago.

62
00:01:59,636 --> 00:02:01,716
Derek is the one who invited
me, and he's gone, so...

63
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:04,872
I...

64
00:02:04,941 --> 00:02:06,174
Yes, I am listening.

65
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:09,729
Dad...

66
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:11,512
I have to go.

67
00:02:11,581 --> 00:02:12,730
Is Alex in the NICU?

68
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:15,033
Don't know and don't
care, 'cause apparently,

69
00:02:15,101 --> 00:02:16,746
he thinks I'm some
sort of '50s housewife

70
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:18,781
who he can tell where
to be and what to do

71
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:19,933
and when to bake a pot roast.

72
00:02:19,957 --> 00:02:21,239
I'm holding a baby.

73
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:23,792
Who's this? Come on, here.

74
00:02:27,497 --> 00:02:30,309
There's been a lot of talking, but
not a lot of getting me out of the car.

75
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:32,901
That's still the plan, right,
get Keith out of the car?

76
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:34,168
That's the plan.

77
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:36,871
When Joanie called and
told me she was pregnant,

78
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:38,860
you know what my
first thought was?

79
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:41,142
Run like hell.

80
00:02:41,211 --> 00:02:42,510
We'd only had the one date.

81
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:45,947
And she agrees,
it kind of sucked.

82
00:02:46,016 --> 00:02:49,151
I think we had sex just to
stop the awkward silence.

83
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:53,388
And then boom...
Insta-family, like Sea-Monkeys.

84
00:02:53,456 --> 00:02:55,039
It was scary.

85
00:02:57,361 --> 00:03:00,028
Now I can't believe
I ever felt like that.

86
00:03:01,999 --> 00:03:04,399
Now all I want
to do is see them.

87
00:03:04,468 --> 00:03:06,451
Grey, we're ready
to cut the roof.

88
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,336
Okay, Keith,

89
00:03:08,404 --> 00:03:10,856
it's gonna get real loud
and then it's gonna get scary,

90
00:03:10,925 --> 00:03:12,134
and then we're gonna
get you out, okay?

91
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:15,410
Loud, scary, free.

92
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:16,961
Got it.

93
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,212
Okay.

94
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,762
All right, let's get in there.
- Let's do this!

95
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:23,902
Okay.

96
00:03:35,732 --> 00:03:38,332
Arizona's having trouble controlling
the post-partum hemorrhage.

97
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:39,445
This just keeps getting...

98
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:40,469
Edwards.

99
00:03:40,537 --> 00:03:41,720
What are you doing?

100
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:44,049
I'm scrubbing in.

101
00:03:44,073 --> 00:03:45,306
No, you're not.

102
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:47,136
I gave you one job,
to keep her in the collar

103
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,237
until trauma cleared her.

104
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:49,628
It was the interns who...

105
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:51,791
And you left her in the
care of first-day interns.

106
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:53,348
They should've known better.

107
00:03:53,417 --> 00:03:55,060
No, you should've known
better. You can go now.

108
00:03:55,084 --> 00:03:57,484
You are no longer going
anywhere near this patient, got it?

109
00:03:59,689 --> 00:04:00,705
Go.

110
00:04:04,027 --> 00:04:05,160
Roof coming off!

111
00:04:05,228 --> 00:04:06,628
Okay, guys, you're clear.

112
00:04:06,697 --> 00:04:09,009
We need a trauma panel
and type and cross for eight.

113
00:04:09,033 --> 00:04:10,465
Got it. Drawing labs.

114
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,086
No blood in the pericardium.

115
00:04:14,154 --> 00:04:15,932
Penetrating
thoraco-abdominal injury.

116
00:04:15,956 --> 00:04:17,255
Ultrasound, please.

117
00:04:17,324 --> 00:04:19,235
Keith, talk to me.
How do you feel?

118
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,409
Popular.

119
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:22,744
Funny. That's funny.

120
00:04:22,812 --> 00:04:24,462
Okay, guys, when you clear,

121
00:04:24,531 --> 00:04:26,643
we're gonna cut away the piece
of the door here that's impaling him,

122
00:04:26,667 --> 00:04:27,843
then you can get
him inside, okay?

123
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:28,933
All right.

124
00:04:32,389 --> 00:04:33,389
Dr. Grey.

125
00:04:36,059 --> 00:04:39,427
I have an update on his fiancee.

126
00:04:39,496 --> 00:04:42,063
April certainly thought
outside the box.

127
00:04:42,132 --> 00:04:43,398
I like this Kepner.

128
00:04:43,466 --> 00:04:45,426
I never thought I
would like Kepner.

129
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:48,419
You know, old Kepner was...

130
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:51,790
There was pigtails and
bunny rabbits and smiling.

131
00:04:51,859 --> 00:04:53,174
Lots of smiling,

132
00:04:53,243 --> 00:04:57,795
but Kepner the reboot,
Kepner 2.0, she's crazy!

133
00:04:57,864 --> 00:04:59,680
She's fierce.

134
00:04:59,749 --> 00:05:00,949
She's woman-ed up.

135
00:05:01,017 --> 00:05:03,234
Thank you, United States Army.

136
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,069
Bailey, Hunt has this.

137
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:07,058
I need you to handle
everything else in the ER.

138
00:05:07,124 --> 00:05:08,623
You are in charge.

139
00:05:08,692 --> 00:05:10,074
Get used to it.

140
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:11,192
Yes, sir!

141
00:05:14,081 --> 00:05:16,798
I thought I made
myself perfectly clear.

142
00:05:16,867 --> 00:05:19,567
You can't just
appoint a new chief.

143
00:05:19,636 --> 00:05:22,415
There are rules and
recommendations that are being made,

144
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:23,905
and then the board votes.

145
00:05:23,973 --> 00:05:26,107
Just because something's
been done one way forever

146
00:05:26,175 --> 00:05:27,653
doesn't mean it
shouldn't change.

147
00:05:27,677 --> 00:05:29,660
- It's called evolution.
- No.

148
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:32,630
What you're talking
about is called dictatorship,

149
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:36,217
and I did not sign up for a
dictatorship, Catherine Avery.

150
00:05:36,286 --> 00:05:38,114
No one asked you
to, Richard Webber.

151
00:05:38,138 --> 00:05:41,189
That's the problem, you
never ask, you only tell.

152
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:42,936
Well, let me tell you
how this is gonna...

153
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,760
Look, I don't want to listen
to another word about it!

154
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:53,167
Let's get back to it!

155
00:05:58,992 --> 00:06:00,232
Excuse me.

156
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:08,233
I can't. I'm...

157
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:10,751
Hey, Keith. Stay with me.

158
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,136
I have some news for you.

159
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,822
Joan's okay.

160
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:16,875
She's headed into surgery,
and you have a baby boy.

161
00:06:18,145 --> 00:06:19,710
A boy?

162
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:21,146
A boy?

163
00:06:22,149 --> 00:06:23,229
I have a son.

164
00:06:26,687 --> 00:06:29,165
Okay, Joan, I'm gonna
put you out now, okay?

165
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:30,829
Uterus is flaccid.
She's hemorrhaging.

166
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:32,390
Okay, we got to put her under.

167
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:33,969
You got to get this under
control now. I know that.

168
00:06:33,993 --> 00:06:35,593
I need a balloon catheter.

169
00:06:35,662 --> 00:06:37,382
Is she out? CALLIE:
Not yet, why?

170
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,471
Joan, Keith is here.

171
00:06:39,515 --> 00:06:40,592
He's here. He's alive.

172
00:06:40,616 --> 00:06:41,616
Keith's here?

173
00:06:41,685 --> 00:06:42,912
They're working on him now.

174
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:47,922
Wilson, go.

175
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:49,601
Pressure's at 70.
We're losing her.

176
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:50,670
Tension on the steering wheel.

177
00:06:50,694 --> 00:06:51,771
Yeah, we got it.

178
00:06:51,795 --> 00:06:54,245
Keith, hang in
there. Hang in there.

179
00:06:54,314 --> 00:06:56,164
All right. All cut.

180
00:06:58,068 --> 00:06:59,317
Okay, stop!

181
00:06:59,385 --> 00:07:01,030
Hey, stop! Stop!
Stop! Okay, hold up.

182
00:07:01,054 --> 00:07:02,254
What is it, Grey?

183
00:07:02,322 --> 00:07:04,122
We can't do this. Not like this.

184
00:07:04,525 --> 00:07:05,790
It's gonna tear him apart.

185
00:07:07,327 --> 00:07:08,887
All right, hang on, guys.

186
00:07:19,589 --> 00:07:21,266
We're gonna open
him up out here?

187
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:22,786
It's the only way.
We start an ex-lap.

188
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:23,925
Clamp everything we can.

189
00:07:23,994 --> 00:07:25,811
It'll buy us time till
we get him upstairs.

190
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:26,923
We only have five or six
minutes till he bleeds out.

191
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:27,979
That's plenty of time.

192
00:07:28,048 --> 00:07:29,330
Guys, guys, all ORs are full.

193
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:30,860
All of them? Tunnel
collapse victims.

194
00:07:30,884 --> 00:07:32,145
No, no, we have a
plastics OR available.

195
00:07:32,169 --> 00:07:33,612
That's all the way at the
other end of the building.

196
00:07:33,636 --> 00:07:35,487
That's impossible.
Nothing's impossible.

197
00:07:35,556 --> 00:07:37,021
We just...

198
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:38,568
All right, we clear a
path to the east elevator.

199
00:07:38,592 --> 00:07:39,802
Move everything out of the way,

200
00:07:39,826 --> 00:07:41,437
stop all foot traffic,
lock down the elevator.

201
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:42,861
Can he make it that far?

202
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:44,729
No, but he will.

203
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:46,108
He doesn't have a choice, right?

204
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,431
So, we run.

205
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,234
All out like Olympians.

206
00:07:49,303 --> 00:07:51,602
It's plenty of time.
It's plenty of time.

207
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:53,149
Let's prep him for
an ex-lap out here.

208
00:07:53,173 --> 00:07:54,556
Okay. Okay.

209
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:56,975
I am not crying wolf.

210
00:07:57,044 --> 00:07:58,609
Sir?

211
00:07:58,679 --> 00:08:02,030
I do not make decisions lightly,
and I don't bow to dictators.

212
00:08:02,098 --> 00:08:03,531
Miranda Bailey,

213
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,567
you will be Grey Sloan
Memorial's next Chief of Surgery!

214
00:08:07,721 --> 00:08:09,120
Congratulations!

215
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,756
Thank you.

216
00:08:14,027 --> 00:08:16,394
Catheter is working, and
the bleeding has stopped.

217
00:08:16,463 --> 00:08:19,097
No tear in the dura, amazingly.

218
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:21,432
So, an intern opened her collar?

219
00:08:21,502 --> 00:08:22,917
Oh, stupid.

220
00:08:22,986 --> 00:08:24,764
Wait, was that the intern that
we thought was an attending?

221
00:08:24,788 --> 00:08:26,165
You mistook an
intern for an attending?

222
00:08:26,189 --> 00:08:28,317
Yeah, he was pretty
much running the trauma.

223
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,925
Like a boss. Like
a hot, hot boss.

224
00:08:30,994 --> 00:08:32,234
Somebody should get into that.

225
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:33,790
Maybe you should get into that.

226
00:08:33,814 --> 00:08:35,158
You know what? You
should get into that.

227
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:36,447
I don't think so.

228
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:39,584
I have started a strict
no-workplace dating policy.

229
00:08:39,653 --> 00:08:41,613
I hear you.

230
00:08:41,671 --> 00:08:44,288
It's all too... You know?

231
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:45,757
They see you, all of you.

232
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:47,992
Then they come to work
and they see you here, too,

233
00:08:48,061 --> 00:08:49,644
and you try to
keep it professional

234
00:08:49,713 --> 00:08:52,247
and get things done, but
suddenly you're thinking,

235
00:08:52,315 --> 00:08:54,732
"I was naked on you before."

236
00:08:54,801 --> 00:08:56,412
Or "I wish you were naked now."

237
00:08:56,436 --> 00:08:59,754
"Hey, remember when you
were there at my very rock bottom

238
00:08:59,823 --> 00:09:02,857
"and I went down the rabbit
hole and dragged you in with me

239
00:09:02,925 --> 00:09:05,927
"and bared the darkest parts of
my soul to you in the midnight hours?

240
00:09:05,996 --> 00:09:07,876
"So, now let's have
a budget meeting."

241
00:09:11,018 --> 00:09:13,018
It's a solid policy.

242
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:14,569
Trust me.

243
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,359
I can't find the 8 ET tubes.

244
00:09:23,981 --> 00:09:25,041
Yeah, but I need more.

245
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:28,199
Webber is making
me Chief of Surgery.

246
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:30,947
That's great, but I got to
get these... Wait, what?

247
00:09:31,221 --> 00:09:32,353
Chief?

248
00:09:32,422 --> 00:09:33,583
Wait, Chief of Surgery?

249
00:09:33,607 --> 00:09:34,839
Ooh, say it again.

250
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:36,686
Hey, how you doing, man?

251
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,721
This is my wife,
Dr. Miranda Bailey,

252
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:40,445
Chief of Surgery.

253
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:42,680
No, chief of all these
damn surgeries.

254
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,203
Oh, I got to get these in.

255
00:09:49,272 --> 00:09:51,039
Oh, yeah, go, go, go.

256
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:54,692
Who is the chief?

257
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:56,728
I am the chief.

258
00:09:56,797 --> 00:09:57,874
Warren, you'll intubate.

259
00:09:57,898 --> 00:09:59,308
Kepner, you and I
will do the ex-lap.

260
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:01,082
Get control of
whatever's bleeding.

261
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:03,129
Grey, I'll need you and Pierce
scrubbed and ready in the OR

262
00:10:03,153 --> 00:10:04,246
when we get there, we got it?

263
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,437
Okay.

264
00:10:05,505 --> 00:10:06,816
Meredith, do me a favor.

265
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,641
Tell Joanie that I
loved her and that I...

266
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:11,242
No. No, no, no.

267
00:10:11,311 --> 00:10:12,991
No messages from
beyond the grave, Keith.

268
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:14,411
We're not doing that.

269
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,280
It's okay.

270
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:17,615
You guys have been great.

271
00:10:17,684 --> 00:10:19,767
You went way above and beyond.

272
00:10:19,836 --> 00:10:21,919
Keith, yes, a lot of people here

273
00:10:21,989 --> 00:10:24,005
are working very
hard to pull this off,

274
00:10:24,074 --> 00:10:26,073
and you have to work, too, okay?

275
00:10:26,142 --> 00:10:29,611
I've seen the looks on
these people's faces.

276
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:31,646
This is not gonna work.

277
00:10:35,185 --> 00:10:36,901
Hunt, I'm gonna need a minute.

278
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,569
Okay.

279
00:10:41,124 --> 00:10:43,642
I'm serious. One minute,
that's all I'm allowing.

280
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:46,127
It's too soon. Fine, fine.

281
00:10:46,196 --> 00:10:49,964
You talk to Wilson yet about
me and the kids moving in?

282
00:10:50,033 --> 00:10:53,334
No. I was a jackass, and now
she's not even talking to me.

283
00:10:54,036 --> 00:10:55,270
I can't even...

284
00:10:55,338 --> 00:10:56,515
Is she moving out?

285
00:10:56,539 --> 00:10:58,205
Is there room for Amelia?

286
00:10:58,275 --> 00:11:00,653
Because you could take your old
room, I could take my old room back,

287
00:11:00,677 --> 00:11:02,438
and then Amelia could
move into Cristina's room.

288
00:11:02,462 --> 00:11:03,862
God, Mer, what the hell?

289
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:05,312
I know, I know,

290
00:11:05,381 --> 00:11:06,859
but I hurt her feelings,
and she's mad at me.

291
00:11:06,883 --> 00:11:08,849
I forgot I'm supposed
to be her sister.

292
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:11,202
You're a complete
tool sometimes.

293
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:12,871
I've heard.

294
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,871
All right, everybody
stop what you're doing.

295
00:11:18,895 --> 00:11:21,662
Quiet, please. Make
a hole. Make a hole.

296
00:11:21,731 --> 00:11:23,731
Let them through, guys.

297
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:29,891
Oh, there he is.

298
00:11:32,142 --> 00:11:33,341
That's his baby.

299
00:11:34,478 --> 00:11:36,177
Is he still conscious?

300
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:49,890
Okay, sweetheart.

301
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:52,059
I have something for you.

302
00:11:58,068 --> 00:11:59,361
Oh, boy.

303
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:01,068
Hey, big man.

304
00:12:04,407 --> 00:12:06,440
Look at you.

305
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:09,610
I'm sorry for all this crap.

306
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:12,696
Sorry, I just wish I...

307
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:21,189
I'm gonna see you when
I get out of here, okay?

308
00:12:21,257 --> 00:12:23,090
You and your mom, yeah?

309
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:27,628
I'm gonna be there and
we're gonna be together, okay?

310
00:12:27,697 --> 00:12:29,374
I love you. Daddy loves you.

311
00:12:29,398 --> 00:12:30,781
Kiss.

312
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:32,583
Okay, okay.

313
00:12:36,873 --> 00:12:38,373
All right, let's bag him.

314
00:12:38,441 --> 00:12:39,690
Push 200 of ketamine.

315
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:44,262
Don't go.

316
00:12:44,848 --> 00:12:46,347
No.

317
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:48,333
I'm right here.

318
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:51,252
That was a bad idea,
bringing him out here like that.

319
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,437
Why?

320
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:54,906
Because I'm gonna
be really pissed

321
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:57,574
if you don't pull this off.

322
00:12:58,761 --> 00:12:59,827
Me too.

323
00:13:14,761 --> 00:13:16,527
That was a really nice idea.

324
00:13:16,596 --> 00:13:19,664
Well, it wasn't mine,
but I'll take credit.

325
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:21,732
Look, I was being a jerk.

326
00:13:21,802 --> 00:13:23,168
Shut up.

327
00:13:23,236 --> 00:13:25,369
I know. We were both jerks.

328
00:13:25,438 --> 00:13:27,038
Can we just move on?

329
00:13:27,107 --> 00:13:28,506
Please.

330
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:29,941
Good.

331
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:31,988
So, I have to ask
you something. Okay.

332
00:13:32,012 --> 00:13:33,689
Meredith asked me
if she could move in.

333
00:13:33,713 --> 00:13:35,557
She's selling her house
and she wants to move in.

334
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:36,781
What do you think?

335
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:37,915
With the kids?

336
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:39,195
No, she's selling the
kids with the house.

337
00:13:39,219 --> 00:13:40,312
Yes, with the kids.

338
00:13:40,336 --> 00:13:41,919
And I get a vote on this?

339
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:43,182
I didn't think that we did that.

340
00:13:43,206 --> 00:13:44,483
I thought we were at this place

341
00:13:44,507 --> 00:13:46,202
where you just told me
what was gonna happen.

342
00:13:46,226 --> 00:13:47,692
I'm asking you.

343
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,510
Yeah, and I can't say
no to the sad widow

344
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:51,462
with the three kids
tapping on the window?

345
00:13:51,531 --> 00:13:53,364
You said you were
putting down roots here.

346
00:13:53,432 --> 00:13:54,916
Congrats.

347
00:13:54,984 --> 00:13:57,751
Now you got a
house and a family.

348
00:13:59,288 --> 00:14:00,566
So, I guess the wedding is off.

349
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:01,639
Yeah, what happened?

350
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:02,752
Did Richard talk to you?

351
00:14:02,776 --> 00:14:03,776
No.

352
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:06,059
Was a complete surprise.

353
00:14:06,128 --> 00:14:07,745
Complete surprise.

354
00:14:14,054 --> 00:14:15,903
Are you okay? I'm fine.

355
00:14:15,972 --> 00:14:17,422
I'm fine.

356
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:21,309
Ready to go, Cap!

357
00:14:23,012 --> 00:14:24,912
Keep an eye on that generator.

358
00:14:26,082 --> 00:14:27,582
Feels familiar, huh?

359
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:29,333
Feels great,
actually. You miss it?

360
00:14:29,402 --> 00:14:30,818
Being in the field?

361
00:14:30,886 --> 00:14:32,798
It's the only thing
I ever think about.

362
00:14:32,822 --> 00:14:35,240
Sats and BP are
stable. Good to go.

363
00:14:36,576 --> 00:14:37,591
Here we go.

364
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:38,843
Okay.

365
00:14:40,596 --> 00:14:42,713
All right, laps.
More laps. Scissors.

366
00:14:42,782 --> 00:14:44,065
Kelly. Kelly.

367
00:14:44,134 --> 00:14:45,377
Looks like it's going
straight into his renal vessels.

368
00:14:45,401 --> 00:14:46,534
Clamp.

369
00:14:46,603 --> 00:14:47,780
I can't reach. Can you get it?

370
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:50,021
I got it. I got it. Crap! Crap!

371
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:51,950
No, I see it. I see
it. Okay, all right.

372
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:53,014
Damn it. Laps.

373
00:14:53,075 --> 00:14:55,009
Okay. Gonna need
a whole lot more laps!

374
00:14:55,077 --> 00:14:56,838
<i>Doctors Hunt and Kepner
start Keith's surgery</i>

375
00:14:56,862 --> 00:14:58,362
outside in the car.

376
00:14:58,431 --> 00:15:00,242
Doctors Grey and Pierce
are standing by in the OR

377
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:01,643
waiting to finish that surgery.

378
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:04,035
You need to help get
Keith from the car to the OR.

379
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:06,949
We estimate we have less than
three minutes to get him from car to OR.

380
00:15:06,973 --> 00:15:08,050
Any more than that, he dies.

381
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:09,184
You make a mistake, he dies.

382
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:11,053
This has to be perfect.
We have one chance.

383
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:12,709
There are no do-overs.

384
00:15:12,778 --> 00:15:15,880
His life and death depends on
how you handle the next few minutes.

385
00:15:15,949 --> 00:15:17,998
Do not mess this up.

386
00:15:18,067 --> 00:15:20,117
Come on, come on, come on.

387
00:15:20,186 --> 00:15:21,819
His chest wall is hashed.

388
00:15:21,888 --> 00:15:22,981
Now, can you get
that last clamp?

389
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:25,790
I got it. I got it. I got it.

390
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:27,691
You, keep these doors open.

391
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,728
You stay on this corner here.

392
00:15:30,797 --> 00:15:32,257
All right, what's
your name? DeLuca.

393
00:15:32,281 --> 00:15:33,748
All right, DeLuca, right here.

394
00:15:33,816 --> 00:15:35,449
You got it.

395
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:37,468
That's it. Let's go.

396
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:39,115
Warren, watch the clamps when
they pull the piece out of him.

397
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:40,733
Kepner, be ready to
pack. Are we ready?

398
00:15:40,757 --> 00:15:43,491
Ready. I'm good.

399
00:15:43,559 --> 00:15:45,254
If this guy's not on the
table in five minutes,

400
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:46,728
this was all for nothing.

401
00:15:48,597 --> 00:15:50,264
I'm starting the clock.

402
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:51,815
Let's all be careful, okay?

403
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:53,584
And go.

404
00:15:56,089 --> 00:15:57,633
All right. What is
your name? Shaw.

405
00:15:57,657 --> 00:15:59,690
Shaw, this elevator
does not move

406
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,692
until our patient
is inside. Got it?

407
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:05,074
I don't know, I can't see.

408
00:16:05,098 --> 00:16:06,146
Me neither.

409
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:10,302
All right.

410
00:16:13,256 --> 00:16:15,117
All right, give me a
hand with the doors.

411
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:16,181
I got it.

412
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,080
There you go.

413
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:24,298
Easy, easy.

414
00:16:27,003 --> 00:16:28,619
All right, give them room.

415
00:16:28,688 --> 00:16:30,020
Let's go.

416
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:33,841
Incoming!

417
00:16:39,882 --> 00:16:42,182
Out of here! Clear the hall! Go!

418
00:16:43,119 --> 00:16:44,285
No! No! No!

419
00:16:46,055 --> 00:16:47,815
Sorry. Sorry. Move, move.

420
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,077
Move!

421
00:16:53,146 --> 00:16:54,146
Hey!

422
00:16:54,214 --> 00:16:56,080
Get out! Get out! Get out!

423
00:16:59,202 --> 00:17:00,334
Incoming! Move!

424
00:17:00,402 --> 00:17:01,763
Uh, just wait. Wait.

425
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:03,721
Wait, wait.

426
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:04,917
Come on! Come on!
Come on! Come on!

427
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:06,034
Come on! Come on! Come on!

428
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:07,058
Move!

429
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:12,096
Who's on the elevator?

430
00:17:12,165 --> 00:17:14,285
Why is it closed? Get it open!

431
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:18,236
Move!

432
00:17:18,304 --> 00:17:20,287
Out! Out! Out! Out!

433
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:31,548
What happened?

434
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:32,678
He coded in the elevator!

435
00:17:32,702 --> 00:17:33,968
Come on.

436
00:17:35,071 --> 00:17:36,954
Ready? One, two, three.

437
00:17:38,858 --> 00:17:40,273
All right. Let's get him back.

438
00:17:40,342 --> 00:17:41,892
Hang some more blood. Paddles.

439
00:17:41,961 --> 00:17:43,944
Push an amp of bicarb. Clear.

440
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:47,398
We have sinus.

441
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:48,994
Okay, we got this?
Yeah, we got it. Go.

442
00:17:49,018 --> 00:17:50,863
Okay. Gonna have
to open up his chest.

443
00:17:50,887 --> 00:17:53,488
Get me a thoracotomy
tray and scalpel.

444
00:17:53,556 --> 00:17:55,989
Oh, got a pumper here, Jackson.

445
00:17:56,058 --> 00:17:57,508
Right angle, bulky.

446
00:17:57,577 --> 00:17:59,310
Come on, Keith. Come on.

447
00:18:06,336 --> 00:18:08,280
<i>Dr. Taylor to the ER.</i>

448
00:18:08,304 --> 00:18:10,270
<i>Dr. Taylor to the ER.</i>

449
00:18:11,106 --> 00:18:12,873
Here you go, Doctor.

450
00:18:12,942 --> 00:18:14,687
He's still alive? For now.

451
00:18:14,711 --> 00:18:16,522
And the girlfriend?
Out of surgery.

452
00:18:16,546 --> 00:18:18,029
Awake. Not paralyzed.

453
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,530
Excellent work.

454
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:25,369
Meredith told you
she's selling the house?

455
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:27,198
What, her house? Yeah.

456
00:18:27,257 --> 00:18:28,839
It was news to me, too.

457
00:18:28,907 --> 00:18:30,147
Where are you gonna go?

458
00:18:30,176 --> 00:18:31,475
I'll find something.

459
00:18:31,544 --> 00:18:33,184
Maybe she'll let
you keep the trailer.

460
00:18:33,246 --> 00:18:34,790
Well, maybe I should
just get a house

461
00:18:34,814 --> 00:18:36,191
that doesn't get
parking tickets.

462
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:37,815
Come on.

463
00:18:37,884 --> 00:18:40,345
You won't miss being able to
reach your toaster from your toilet?

464
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:41,609
I might.

465
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:46,356
I really want this to work.

466
00:18:48,261 --> 00:18:49,559
Yeah?

467
00:18:51,681 --> 00:18:53,397
This family.

468
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:54,865
All three of them.

469
00:18:54,934 --> 00:18:56,094
Right. Right.

470
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:59,482
What did you think I
meant? Oh, nothing, no.

471
00:18:59,506 --> 00:19:00,972
That. Yeah.

472
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,473
Me too.

473
00:19:05,744 --> 00:19:07,327
Jo!

474
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:08,963
Jo, come here.

475
00:19:13,636 --> 00:19:17,154
The sad widow is my
friend, my best friend.

476
00:19:17,223 --> 00:19:18,588
And I don't want to piss you off

477
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,369
and I don't want you
running off somewhere,

478
00:19:20,393 --> 00:19:22,676
but I can't say no to her.

479
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:25,195
So, you're saying
no to me. Okay.

480
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:26,914
No.

481
00:19:26,983 --> 00:19:29,784
Look, all that crap I said
about building a life here

482
00:19:29,852 --> 00:19:33,087
and about putting down
roots... Look, I meant with you.

483
00:19:33,156 --> 00:19:36,590
I want a house with
you, my career with you.

484
00:19:36,659 --> 00:19:39,993
Maybe someday a dog, maybe.

485
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:44,198
It's all supposed
to be with you.

486
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:46,183
I thought you got that.

487
00:19:46,252 --> 00:19:48,286
I didn't think I
needed to say it.

488
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:50,149
So, when I say that I
can't say no to my friend,

489
00:19:50,173 --> 00:19:51,633
it doesn't mean
I'm saying no to you.

490
00:19:51,657 --> 00:19:54,608
I want you and
all of it with you.

491
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:58,145
Okay.

492
00:19:58,213 --> 00:19:59,430
Where are you going?

493
00:19:59,499 --> 00:20:01,616
I just...

494
00:20:01,684 --> 00:20:04,184
I have to think
about what I want.

495
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,705
Vitals are steady.

496
00:20:08,774 --> 00:20:10,174
We may actually pull this out.

497
00:20:10,243 --> 00:20:12,576
This will make a hell
of a wedding story.

498
00:20:12,644 --> 00:20:15,228
Hey, what is going on
with your mom and Richard?

499
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:17,748
Ah, same old crap.

500
00:20:17,817 --> 00:20:19,416
<i>Clash of the Titans.</i>

501
00:20:19,485 --> 00:20:20,517
What?

502
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:22,052
They both want to be boss.

503
00:20:22,121 --> 00:20:23,804
Both want to dig in,

504
00:20:23,873 --> 00:20:25,017
And my mom is the
smartest person in the room.

505
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:26,257
She's used to it.

506
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:27,669
She's used to
everybody knowing that

507
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:28,971
she's the smartest
person in the room.

508
00:20:28,995 --> 00:20:31,478
So, when you challenge
her, it's World War III.

509
00:20:31,547 --> 00:20:35,066
And Richard is the same.

510
00:20:35,134 --> 00:20:38,836
Well, that is just
ridiculous and pathetic.

511
00:20:38,905 --> 00:20:41,755
I mean, you don't just shrug
your shoulders and call it quits.

512
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:45,337
You find a way to work
through it. You don't just

513
00:20:45,361 --> 00:20:48,646
give up and throw it all
away like it was nothing.

514
00:20:48,714 --> 00:20:50,681
Oh. Oh...

515
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,182
I'm sorry.

516
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,645
It's something else. She
doesn't want to talk about it.

517
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,519
Don't look at me. Ignore me.

518
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:57,921
Welcome to the family.

519
00:21:01,944 --> 00:21:04,225
Thank you, Doctor.

520
00:21:04,446 --> 00:21:06,813
I have something for you.

521
00:21:08,784 --> 00:21:10,084
It's my old cellphone.

522
00:21:10,152 --> 00:21:11,986
There's one voicemail on it.

523
00:21:12,054 --> 00:21:14,454
Password is 1515.

524
00:21:16,425 --> 00:21:18,859
And make sure you're
alone when you listen to it.

525
00:21:32,474 --> 00:21:33,902
Who does the
post-anesthesia checks?

526
00:21:33,926 --> 00:21:35,676
Shut up.

527
00:21:35,745 --> 00:21:37,823
Isn't rounds when we're
supposed to ask questions?

528
00:21:37,847 --> 00:21:40,025
I thought you weren't
allowed to go near that patient.

529
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:41,882
Did I not just say shut up?

530
00:21:43,019 --> 00:21:44,184
Hi, Joan.

531
00:21:44,253 --> 00:21:46,002
It's Dr. Edwards.

532
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:48,104
Give my hands a squeeze?

533
00:21:48,173 --> 00:21:49,807
They fixed me up.

534
00:21:49,876 --> 00:21:51,586
Can you squeeze a little
harder for me on your right?

535
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:55,045
I am, as hard as I can.

536
00:21:55,114 --> 00:21:57,074
I can't really breathe.

537
00:21:57,917 --> 00:21:59,700
Her sats are
dropping pretty fast.

538
00:21:59,769 --> 00:22:00,846
What's happening?

539
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:02,620
Shaw, bag her.

540
00:22:02,689 --> 00:22:05,417
Get a crash cart and an
intubation tray in here now.

541
00:22:05,441 --> 00:22:07,603
Don't take that off. I did
that. You don't want to...

542
00:22:07,627 --> 00:22:09,638
She's hemorrhaging. Blood's
compressing her trachea.

543
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:10,722
Gloves! Gloves!

544
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:12,712
She's losing her airway.

545
00:22:12,781 --> 00:22:14,347
Scalpel.

546
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:15,666
Page Shepherd and Torres.

547
00:22:15,735 --> 00:22:16,984
Betadine.

548
00:22:17,052 --> 00:22:18,452
Scalpel, now.

549
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:40,274
Sats back up to 93, 95.

550
00:22:40,342 --> 00:22:41,375
What happened?

551
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:43,483
Looks like a leaking
carotid pseudoaneurysm.

552
00:22:43,545 --> 00:22:44,705
What about her right side?

553
00:22:44,747 --> 00:22:46,358
Will she get her
motor function back?

554
00:22:46,382 --> 00:22:47,626
I'm more worried about
brain death at this point.

555
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:49,128
She can easily throw a clot and

556
00:22:49,152 --> 00:22:50,595
have a massive
hemispheric stroke.

557
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:52,397
Well, it's a good
thing that you caught it.

558
00:22:52,421 --> 00:22:54,688
No, Edwards. Edwards did.

559
00:22:56,975 --> 00:22:58,776
Dr. Edwards, is there any chance

560
00:22:58,845 --> 00:23:01,445
the leak could cause
permanent... Will you hush?

561
00:23:02,097 --> 00:23:04,143
Just sit back there
and stay silent.

562
00:23:04,167 --> 00:23:05,966
Edwards! What?

563
00:23:06,035 --> 00:23:07,250
These are your ducklings.

564
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:08,902
I'm sorry, what?

565
00:23:08,971 --> 00:23:10,615
Today is the first
day of your new job,

566
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:12,233
and you have failed gloriously.

567
00:23:12,257 --> 00:23:15,342
You are a teacher. Now,
these interns are yours.

568
00:23:15,411 --> 00:23:17,322
They're your ducklings,
and you're letting them drown!

569
00:23:17,346 --> 00:23:19,579
Well, I want them to drown.

570
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:20,725
I want to watch it.

571
00:23:20,749 --> 00:23:22,182
Well, you can't.

572
00:23:22,251 --> 00:23:24,918
You have to teach them
how to paddle their stupid feet

573
00:23:24,987 --> 00:23:26,470
and stay above the water.

574
00:23:26,539 --> 00:23:28,238
They're going to screw up.

575
00:23:28,307 --> 00:23:30,307
And it will never
be their fault.

576
00:23:30,376 --> 00:23:32,376
It will always be your fault.

577
00:23:32,445 --> 00:23:34,728
But how you teach
them will determine

578
00:23:34,796 --> 00:23:36,796
how they treat patients
for years to come.

579
00:23:36,865 --> 00:23:39,216
They're your web-footed legacy,

580
00:23:39,285 --> 00:23:40,684
and they're brilliant students.

581
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:44,288
Hand-selected for this program
by doctors wiser than you,

582
00:23:44,356 --> 00:23:46,423
and they're your responsibility.

583
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:48,725
Raise your ducklings.

584
00:23:58,187 --> 00:24:01,805
<i>Dr. Toretto to radiology.
Dr. Toretto to radiology.</i>

585
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:27,731
What is the matter with you two?

586
00:24:30,086 --> 00:24:31,684
My husband is dead.

587
00:24:31,753 --> 00:24:34,087
Yeah, I'm gonna play that card.

588
00:24:35,942 --> 00:24:37,274
You.

589
00:24:40,012 --> 00:24:42,529
You walked away from
Ellis, never got to be with her,

590
00:24:42,598 --> 00:24:44,264
and now she's dead.

591
00:24:44,333 --> 00:24:45,899
Adele is dead.

592
00:24:48,637 --> 00:24:50,415
And you. I don't know
who's dead for you.

593
00:24:50,439 --> 00:24:53,206
But the both of you are
very, very much alive

594
00:24:53,275 --> 00:24:55,754
and breathing and
driving each other crazy.

595
00:24:55,778 --> 00:24:59,530
And you yell and
argue and fight,

596
00:24:59,598 --> 00:25:04,768
and you both should be thrilled
to be able to do those things.

597
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:09,089
I would give anything to
be able to do those things.

598
00:25:09,158 --> 00:25:11,992
And none of those
things are reason enough

599
00:25:12,061 --> 00:25:14,494
to not be with the
person that you love,

600
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:17,898
especially when
there just isn't enough.

601
00:25:17,967 --> 00:25:20,266
There will never be enough time.

602
00:25:21,904 --> 00:25:23,603
And you both know that.

603
00:25:23,672 --> 00:25:26,740
So whatever it is that's
coming between you two,

604
00:25:26,809 --> 00:25:28,692
will you just
please figure it out?

605
00:25:31,246 --> 00:25:32,746
Figure it out.

606
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:46,209
It's amazing
anyone survived this.

607
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:49,430
You should be proud of yourself.

608
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:52,049
It was a little ballsy, huh?

609
00:25:52,118 --> 00:25:55,018
It was, actually,
and you loved it.

610
00:25:58,591 --> 00:26:02,893
And I don't know
why you're upset.

611
00:26:02,962 --> 00:26:04,573
Because I need to say something,

612
00:26:04,597 --> 00:26:06,864
and I don't know how to say it.

613
00:26:06,933 --> 00:26:08,599
I don't even want to say it.

614
00:26:08,668 --> 00:26:11,085
You want to go back.

615
00:26:11,153 --> 00:26:14,355
There's another plane going to
Jordan in a couple weeks, and you...

616
00:26:16,959 --> 00:26:18,758
And you want to be on it.

617
00:26:22,331 --> 00:26:24,531
The way I felt today,

618
00:26:24,599 --> 00:26:27,333
every day is like it out there.

619
00:26:27,402 --> 00:26:29,870
I thought it was
just readjustment,

620
00:26:29,938 --> 00:26:32,206
and then I thought it was, like,

621
00:26:32,274 --> 00:26:35,876
an adrenaline addiction or
something, but it feels like...

622
00:26:37,346 --> 00:26:39,279
I don't know, I...

623
00:26:39,348 --> 00:26:41,881
I feel like I've been
called, Jackson.

624
00:26:43,585 --> 00:26:45,652
Well, maybe you should go back.

625
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:49,056
Really?

626
00:26:50,659 --> 00:26:53,093
When we lost Samuel,

627
00:26:53,162 --> 00:26:57,898
a light went out in
you, and I miss it.

628
00:26:57,966 --> 00:26:59,966
I miss it so much.

629
00:27:01,203 --> 00:27:03,770
And whatever it was over there,

630
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:06,907
you know, whatever
it is, it got relit.

631
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:11,544
Thank you.

632
00:27:12,731 --> 00:27:14,864
Wait. Wait.

633
00:27:15,834 --> 00:27:18,835
April, I love you so much.

634
00:27:21,774 --> 00:27:25,091
But I don't think I can be
here when you come back.

635
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,793
You understand?

636
00:27:28,163 --> 00:27:29,396
What?

637
00:27:30,366 --> 00:27:31,764
What? Why?

638
00:27:31,833 --> 00:27:33,199
No.

639
00:27:33,268 --> 00:27:34,413
It's only gonna be
a couple of months.

640
00:27:34,437 --> 00:27:36,131
It's not gonna be a year. No.

641
00:27:36,155 --> 00:27:37,616
I promise I'll... No.

642
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:40,623
You don't know what I've
been through this last year.

643
00:27:40,693 --> 00:27:43,293
This last year,
what it was like...

644
00:27:43,361 --> 00:27:44,601
I... I know.

645
00:27:44,664 --> 00:27:47,080
I... It was... It
was hard. I know.

646
00:27:47,149 --> 00:27:49,783
What do you mean you
know? You don't know.

647
00:27:49,852 --> 00:27:51,084
You never asked.

648
00:27:52,437 --> 00:27:54,137
Not once, in fact.

649
00:27:54,206 --> 00:27:55,405
How was I doing?

650
00:27:55,473 --> 00:27:57,791
How was I coping?

651
00:27:57,859 --> 00:28:00,160
You didn't even ask.

652
00:28:00,228 --> 00:28:01,348
I'm sorry.

653
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:03,630
God, I'm sorry.

654
00:28:03,699 --> 00:28:04,831
I'm sorry.

655
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,010
But we talked. You know...

656
00:28:06,034 --> 00:28:07,279
And... Yeah, you know what?

657
00:28:07,303 --> 00:28:10,120
You got to have your
life-altering journey, okay?

658
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:11,705
And I stayed behind.

659
00:28:11,774 --> 00:28:12,972
And I held stuff down.

660
00:28:13,058 --> 00:28:15,709
And I silenced myself
so that you could grieve.

661
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:17,689
If you need to grieve, we can...

662
00:28:17,713 --> 00:28:19,729
I did! I did need to grieve.

663
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:22,166
I needed to. Needed to with you.

664
00:28:23,802 --> 00:28:26,904
That's what marriage
is to me, April.

665
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:30,207
So...

666
00:28:30,275 --> 00:28:32,120
Okay, so you're
saying that if I go...

667
00:28:32,144 --> 00:28:34,577
If I go again, then we're done?

668
00:28:35,614 --> 00:28:37,480
You're just calling it?

669
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:45,738
Squeeze my fingers.

670
00:28:48,477 --> 00:28:50,727
Good. Very good.

671
00:28:50,796 --> 00:28:52,129
My baby... Is my baby okay?

672
00:28:52,197 --> 00:28:53,830
He's doing just fine.

673
00:28:56,368 --> 00:28:59,002
And Keith? Is he...

674
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:00,603
I'm right here.

675
00:29:01,974 --> 00:29:03,673
You're here?

676
00:29:04,643 --> 00:29:06,376
I'm here.

677
00:29:06,445 --> 00:29:07,945
I'm looking right at you.

678
00:29:09,348 --> 00:29:10,981
I saw our baby.

679
00:29:12,151 --> 00:29:14,534
He's beautiful.
He's so beautiful.

680
00:29:14,603 --> 00:29:16,936
He looks exactly like me.

681
00:29:18,974 --> 00:29:21,141
Don't make me laugh.

682
00:29:21,209 --> 00:29:24,077
It hurts.

683
00:29:24,145 --> 00:29:28,147
Okay, but research budgets are
approved by one department head,

684
00:29:28,217 --> 00:29:29,260
not a committee.

685
00:29:29,284 --> 00:29:30,717
Agreed. Next point.

686
00:29:30,785 --> 00:29:32,764
I have a say in all the
residency candidates.

687
00:29:32,788 --> 00:29:34,054
Rejected. Never gonna happen.

688
00:29:34,122 --> 00:29:35,522
I gave you Valentine's Day!

689
00:29:35,591 --> 00:29:37,858
If I have to celebrate
Valentine's Day,

690
00:29:37,927 --> 00:29:40,510
I get to review the
prospective residents.

691
00:29:40,579 --> 00:29:42,879
And give a recommendation.

692
00:29:42,948 --> 00:29:44,414
Nothing more.

693
00:29:44,483 --> 00:29:45,849
I have final say.

694
00:29:45,918 --> 00:29:46,984
That's fair.

695
00:29:47,052 --> 00:29:48,384
Next point.

696
00:29:51,273 --> 00:29:53,407
Miranda Bailey is the
next Chief of Surgery.

697
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:56,343
Miranda Bailey

698
00:29:56,412 --> 00:29:59,379
is judged against an outside
candidate of my choosing.

699
00:29:59,448 --> 00:30:02,282
Then the board
votes based on merit.

700
00:30:06,689 --> 00:30:08,522
That's...

701
00:30:08,591 --> 00:30:10,257
That's fair.

702
00:30:10,325 --> 00:30:12,426
Agreed. Next point.

703
00:30:13,828 --> 00:30:15,561
Now, when we're at home...

704
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:16,896
We are not at work.

705
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:18,665
We leave work at the hospital.

706
00:30:18,734 --> 00:30:20,533
Rejected. Totally unrealistic.

707
00:30:20,602 --> 00:30:22,146
Richard, our schedules. Come on!

708
00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:23,948
Hey, I understand, but we
need some time for each...

709
00:30:23,972 --> 00:30:25,238
The bedroom.

710
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:29,592
No work in the bedroom.

711
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:33,379
Next point.

712
00:30:37,653 --> 00:30:40,787
I will provide a safe harbor.

713
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:44,274
What does that mean?

714
00:30:44,343 --> 00:30:46,843
You need a place to
not be Catherine Avery.

715
00:30:46,912 --> 00:30:51,114
To not be decisive
and set agendas

716
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:54,418
and rise to the level
of accomplishments

717
00:30:54,486 --> 00:30:58,321
that the world has
come to expect of you.

718
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:00,456
You need a place to fall apart.

719
00:31:01,827 --> 00:31:04,661
I will be that place.

720
00:31:08,267 --> 00:31:11,368
Should you require it.

721
00:31:16,758 --> 00:31:18,492
In perpetuity.

722
00:31:40,281 --> 00:31:43,367
Richard, do you take
Catherine to be your wife

723
00:31:43,435 --> 00:31:45,063
for as long as
you both shall live?

724
00:31:45,087 --> 00:31:46,381
I do. And Catherine?

725
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:48,705
I do. I do, forever.

726
00:31:48,774 --> 00:31:52,025
Then by the power vested in
me by the state of Washington,

727
00:31:52,094 --> 00:31:55,174
I now pronounce
you husband and wife.

728
00:32:16,902 --> 00:32:17,902
Hello.

729
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:19,670
Hi.

730
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:26,087
Hey, bottoms up,
Plastics Posse...

731
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:27,789
Let's just enjoy the party, huh?

732
00:32:27,813 --> 00:32:29,112
Where's Kepner?

733
00:32:30,749 --> 00:32:31,915
I don't know.

734
00:32:34,553 --> 00:32:36,719
Hey. Where have you been?

735
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:39,256
Come with me. I want
to show you something.

736
00:32:40,709 --> 00:32:42,375
Oh, congratulations, Chief!

737
00:32:42,444 --> 00:32:44,644
Thank you, thank you.

738
00:32:44,712 --> 00:32:46,612
And speaking of chief, um...

739
00:32:46,681 --> 00:32:48,814
I had a talk with Catherine,

740
00:32:48,883 --> 00:32:51,551
and there is going to be, um...

741
00:32:54,406 --> 00:32:55,716
I don't know how
to say this, but...

742
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,340
You have got to be kidding me.

743
00:32:57,408 --> 00:33:00,143
You're running just
against one other candidate,

744
00:33:00,212 --> 00:33:01,389
but you're gonna have it.

745
00:33:01,413 --> 00:33:05,015
Sir, I understand,
but it's just not fair.

746
00:33:05,084 --> 00:33:07,233
Well, actually, it's
the only fair way...

747
00:33:07,302 --> 00:33:09,503
No, no, no. To this
other candidate,

748
00:33:09,571 --> 00:33:12,650
because I am going to
wipe the floor with her, or him.

749
00:33:12,674 --> 00:33:13,706
It's gonna hurt.

750
00:33:13,776 --> 00:33:15,208
Getting trounced hurts,

751
00:33:15,277 --> 00:33:18,161
and it'll be embarrassing,
publicly and professionally,

752
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:20,547
losing by that wide a margin,

753
00:33:20,616 --> 00:33:23,633
because I am
primed for this job, sir.

754
00:33:23,702 --> 00:33:25,135
I deserve this job.

755
00:33:25,203 --> 00:33:27,432
There isn't a single person
in this room who would...

756
00:33:27,456 --> 00:33:28,588
Disagree.

757
00:33:28,657 --> 00:33:31,958
Disagree that I am
not so ready for this job.

758
00:33:32,027 --> 00:33:33,226
It's already mine.

759
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:35,607
Damn right it is.

760
00:33:35,631 --> 00:33:36,713
Mmm-hmm.

761
00:33:36,781 --> 00:33:37,926
Pardon me, dear, but Dr. Webber

762
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:40,600
has a couple of moves
I haven't seen yet.

763
00:33:42,203 --> 00:33:43,352
I love you.

764
00:33:50,145 --> 00:33:52,646
Why are we here?

765
00:33:52,714 --> 00:33:54,014
It's a loft space.

766
00:33:54,082 --> 00:33:55,181
Jo, it's a crime scene.

767
00:33:55,249 --> 00:33:57,828
Stop! Stop it.
You're ruining it.

768
00:33:57,852 --> 00:33:59,814
Someone beat me
to that. Oh, shut up!

769
00:33:59,838 --> 00:34:02,272
It's all I can afford.

770
00:34:05,144 --> 00:34:07,744
I took everything,

771
00:34:07,812 --> 00:34:10,213
all my savings,
everything that I had,

772
00:34:10,282 --> 00:34:14,133
and it was almost enough
to cover the whole thing.

773
00:34:14,202 --> 00:34:16,636
Wait. You're buying this?

774
00:34:16,705 --> 00:34:18,521
Well, um...

775
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:21,574
We are, if you want to pitch in.

776
00:34:21,643 --> 00:34:23,643
I put in an offer.

777
00:34:26,298 --> 00:34:29,299
Sell Meredith her house back.

778
00:34:29,367 --> 00:34:33,036
Because this is what I want.

779
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:37,123
Our own place, for us.

780
00:34:37,192 --> 00:34:39,525
And... And I just...

781
00:34:39,594 --> 00:34:40,993
I saw this place,

782
00:34:41,062 --> 00:34:43,429
and I thought that we
could make it anything.

783
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:46,366
Whatever we want.

784
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,636
Because I love you,

785
00:34:51,156 --> 00:34:53,323
and I love living with you.

786
00:34:53,392 --> 00:34:55,858
But we should just...

787
00:34:55,928 --> 00:34:58,594
We should have our own place.

788
00:34:58,663 --> 00:34:59,963
Just us.

789
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,367
If you want that.

790
00:35:04,436 --> 00:35:06,535
If that's... If that's
what you want, too.

791
00:35:08,006 --> 00:35:10,039
You've never said that.

792
00:35:11,376 --> 00:35:12,475
Said what?

793
00:35:12,544 --> 00:35:14,527
"I love you."

794
00:35:16,681 --> 00:35:18,548
I didn't think that I had to.

795
00:35:27,692 --> 00:35:30,226
Patient presented in
labor with a fracture at c5-6.

796
00:35:30,295 --> 00:35:32,329
Radioulnar fracture
was reduced in the field.

797
00:35:32,397 --> 00:35:34,357
Post-op, she bled from a
carotid pseudoaneurysm,

798
00:35:34,399 --> 00:35:37,278
which was repaired with
an arteriotomy and a patch.

799
00:35:37,302 --> 00:35:39,147
Patient now shows
no neuro deficits

800
00:35:39,171 --> 00:35:41,531
and is expected to
make a full recovery.

801
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:43,539
Questions.

802
00:35:43,608 --> 00:35:45,219
Would the chance for
recovery have been different...

803
00:35:45,243 --> 00:35:48,239
Are high-dose steroids still
indicated for immediate treatment?

804
00:35:55,203 --> 00:35:56,369
I know.

805
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,972
I know. I do.

806
00:36:14,122 --> 00:36:16,005
Sorry. I was just...

807
00:36:18,293 --> 00:36:19,592
You all right?

808
00:36:21,613 --> 00:36:24,047
I was just about to
listen to a message.

809
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:27,350
But I can't

810
00:36:28,687 --> 00:36:31,555
seem to bring
myself to hit play.

811
00:36:54,613 --> 00:36:56,529
<i>Hey, it's me.</i>

812
00:36:56,598 --> 00:36:57,775
<i>I'm on the ferry.</i>

813
00:36:57,799 --> 00:37:00,717
<i>I just wanted to say that, um...</i>

814
00:37:00,785 --> 00:37:03,102
<i>God, I wish you could see this.</i>

815
00:37:03,171 --> 00:37:05,038
<i>Weather's classic Seattle.</i>

816
00:37:07,509 --> 00:37:10,877
<i>The water is so blue.</i>

817
00:37:10,945 --> 00:37:15,081
It may be the most perfect
ferryboat ride I've ever had in my life.

818
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:16,777
We're gonna do this a
lot more when I get home,

819
00:37:16,801 --> 00:37:18,246
by the way. You,
me, and the family.

820
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:20,203
We're just gonna take a day

821
00:37:21,306 --> 00:37:24,474
and ride the ferryboat.
All day if we want.

822
00:37:25,444 --> 00:37:27,244
I love you, Meredith.

823
00:37:27,312 --> 00:37:30,192
I know I just left, and I'm
not even at the airport yet,

824
00:37:30,249 --> 00:37:33,650
but I just wanted
to say I love you.

825
00:37:34,419 --> 00:37:36,486
I love our family.

826
00:37:38,189 --> 00:37:40,357
And we're gonna keep doing this.

827
00:37:44,396 --> 00:37:46,062
I'll see you when I get home.

828
00:37:47,232 --> 00:37:48,531
I love you.

829
00:37:58,743 --> 00:38:00,192
You okay?

830
00:38:02,797 --> 00:38:03,797
Yeah.

831
00:38:06,601 --> 00:38:08,001
Yeah.

832
00:38:10,205 --> 00:38:11,521
I am.

833
00:38:21,983 --> 00:38:23,549
What is wrong?

834
00:38:23,618 --> 00:38:26,652
And don't say you're
fine. Nothing. I'm fine.

835
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:28,320
What... Did somebody die?

836
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:29,390
Oh.

837
00:38:34,279 --> 00:38:36,513
My parents are
getting a divorce.

838
00:38:36,581 --> 00:38:39,532
My mom called and told me today.

839
00:38:41,753 --> 00:38:43,953
She's been having an affair

840
00:38:44,022 --> 00:38:46,856
with the man that
services their cars.

841
00:38:48,093 --> 00:38:49,525
For 11 years.

842
00:38:51,163 --> 00:38:55,131
He's been servicing
their cars and my mom.

843
00:38:56,735 --> 00:39:00,837
And my dad found out about it
years ago, and he was enraged,

844
00:39:00,906 --> 00:39:05,408
and he stuck with it
for me, because I was...

845
00:39:05,477 --> 00:39:09,362
I was still in town. I
was always around.

846
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:12,999
You know, so they held
it together for the kid.

847
00:39:13,068 --> 00:39:14,100
Classic.

848
00:39:14,169 --> 00:39:16,009
Except the kid's a grown woman.

849
00:39:18,673 --> 00:39:21,107
They wanted to preserve my

850
00:39:22,010 --> 00:39:23,843
happy, idyllic,

851
00:39:26,814 --> 00:39:29,966
pathetic, crap-filled
lie of a childhood!

852
00:39:34,739 --> 00:39:36,005
Why didn't you tell me?

853
00:39:36,074 --> 00:39:37,194
I...

854
00:39:39,977 --> 00:39:42,278
Your husband died,

855
00:39:42,347 --> 00:39:45,831
and I am crying like a seven-year-old
over Mommy and Daddy.

856
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:47,283
I...

857
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:51,103
I didn't grow up like you. I...

858
00:39:51,172 --> 00:39:53,757
I've never lost anyone.

859
00:39:53,825 --> 00:39:56,665
I never even had a cat die. I
still have all my grandparents.

860
00:39:57,912 --> 00:40:00,579
There's no darkness in my life.

861
00:40:00,649 --> 00:40:02,331
Just, I've never had it.

862
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,701
So I'm not gonna
come talk to you about it.

863
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:08,687
Well, you should
always come talk to me.

864
00:40:08,756 --> 00:40:11,690
Because whatever it is,
chances are, I've seen worse,

865
00:40:11,759 --> 00:40:16,229
and I am qualified to
tell you how you'll survive.

866
00:40:16,297 --> 00:40:18,481
You should always
come and talk to me.

867
00:40:34,065 --> 00:40:35,381
What are you crying about?

868
00:40:35,449 --> 00:40:36,966
What are you crying about?

869
00:40:47,262 --> 00:40:48,594
Derek would have loved this.

870
00:40:48,662 --> 00:40:50,914
He came from this
big, noisy family.

871
00:40:52,934 --> 00:40:56,702
I want this to be my last
memory of this house.

872
00:40:56,771 --> 00:40:59,155
That's what he wanted, to
fill it with noise and people.

873
00:41:00,325 --> 00:41:02,958
<i>You can build a
house out of anything,</i>

874
00:41:03,027 --> 00:41:04,544
<i>make it as strong as you want.</i>

875
00:41:07,498 --> 00:41:10,099
Okay. We have to dance it out.

876
00:41:10,535 --> 00:41:12,001
What?

877
00:41:12,069 --> 00:41:13,136
What does that mean?

878
00:41:13,204 --> 00:41:14,504
Let's go.

879
00:41:14,572 --> 00:41:15,838
<i>But a home...</i>

880
00:41:15,906 --> 00:41:18,524
<i>A home is more
fragile than that.</i>

881
00:41:29,971 --> 00:41:32,905
<i>A home is made of
the people you fill it with.</i>

882
00:41:40,214 --> 00:41:43,950
<i>And people can be broken, sure.</i>

883
00:41:44,019 --> 00:41:45,985
<i>But any surgeon knows</i>

884
00:41:47,672 --> 00:41:49,873
<i>what's broken can be mended.</i>

885
00:41:58,299 --> 00:42:00,366
<i>What's hurt can be healed.</i>

886
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:07,122
<i>That no matter how dark it gets,</i>

887
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:08,791
<i>the sun's gonna rise again.</i>
