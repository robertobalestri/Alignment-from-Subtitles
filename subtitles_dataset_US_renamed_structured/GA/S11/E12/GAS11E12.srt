1
00:00:09,126 --> 00:00:11,426
Are you sure you
should do that here?

2
00:00:11,495 --> 00:00:13,829
We're awfully close to the road.

3
00:00:13,897 --> 00:00:15,137
What are you so worried about?

4
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:17,249
What we're doing is illegal!

5
00:00:17,318 --> 00:00:19,563
I just don't like doing
things that are illegal.

6
00:00:19,587 --> 00:00:22,070
What? So, we just
dump him on the ground?

7
00:00:22,139 --> 00:00:24,806
No, you know, we scatter him.

8
00:00:25,976 --> 00:00:27,809
Around the campsite.

9
00:00:29,413 --> 00:00:30,679
This is our spot.

10
00:00:34,668 --> 00:00:37,503
Okay, Pops. It's show time.

11
00:00:37,571 --> 00:00:40,188
<i>Everybody has something to hide.</i>

12
00:00:42,192 --> 00:00:44,859
<i>We can't just expose all
our secrets to the world.</i>

13
00:00:44,928 --> 00:00:46,389
It's on the top
shelf in the fridge.

14
00:00:46,413 --> 00:00:47,512
Hello, I'm in here.

15
00:00:47,581 --> 00:00:49,041
Oh, I know. I'm sorry.

16
00:00:49,065 --> 00:00:51,044
Our shower's still
busted and I got rounds.

17
00:00:51,068 --> 00:00:53,096
You know what, I have
told him a thousand times,

18
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,798
"You put the bread on
the counter, it molds.

19
00:00:54,822 --> 00:00:57,188
"You put it in the
fridge and it's fine."

20
00:00:57,258 --> 00:00:59,298
I'm right, right?

21
00:01:00,061 --> 00:01:02,177
Okay. Whew!

22
00:01:02,262 --> 00:01:04,107
Hey, do you know
where the bread is?

23
00:01:04,131 --> 00:01:05,909
You need to get
your shower fixed!

24
00:01:05,933 --> 00:01:07,053
<i>That's how we get hurt.</i>

25
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,667
<i>It's how we risk
hurting other people.</i>

26
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:12,304
<i>We have to decide
how much we let out</i>

27
00:01:12,372 --> 00:01:14,656
<i>and keep the truth to ourselves.</i>

28
00:01:14,725 --> 00:01:16,525
Hey. How'd it go with the kids?

29
00:01:16,593 --> 00:01:19,256
Uh, great. They're amazing. I
just dropped them off at daycare.

30
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,929
Thanks again for watching them.

31
00:01:20,998 --> 00:01:22,330
Yeah. How about you?

32
00:01:22,399 --> 00:01:25,484
How was your weekend in DC

33
00:01:25,553 --> 00:01:26,851
with your husband?

34
00:01:27,955 --> 00:01:29,955
It was fun.

35
00:01:30,023 --> 00:01:33,125
I'm a little
exhausted, you know.

36
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:35,577
But it was the good
kind of exhausted, right?

37
00:01:35,646 --> 00:01:37,240
Did you even leave the bedroom?

38
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:38,858
Was he surprised? Did he freak?

39
00:01:38,882 --> 00:01:41,366
Yeah, did he freak?

40
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:42,879
Or did you just go
straight to getting

41
00:01:42,903 --> 00:01:44,581
<i>♪ frea-kay? ♪</i>

42
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:47,325
You know, did we even push
the button, because it's just...

43
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:49,385
Oh. Mm-hmm.

44
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:52,577
Hey, look who's back.

45
00:01:52,646 --> 00:01:56,397
Meredith was just about to tell
us about her weekend with Derek.

46
00:01:56,466 --> 00:01:58,983
Good. Tell me now so you
don't show up in my bed tonight.

47
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:01,586
It's a good thing you didn't
walk in on this morning.

48
00:02:01,655 --> 00:02:03,087
Oh.

49
00:02:03,156 --> 00:02:05,107
Everyone's getting
freaky but me.

50
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:07,893
Well, actually, I was just...

51
00:02:07,962 --> 00:02:10,428
Actually remembered,
I have to... Yeah.

52
00:02:11,415 --> 00:02:13,799
They totally got freaky.

53
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:15,078
And I come in this morning,

54
00:02:15,102 --> 00:02:19,037
and Herman's rearranged
the entire OR board

55
00:02:19,106 --> 00:02:20,438
with new fetal surgeries.

56
00:02:20,507 --> 00:02:22,502
I used to be so good
at one-night stands.

57
00:02:22,526 --> 00:02:24,426
I missed a beat.

58
00:02:24,512 --> 00:02:25,978
No, I was great at them.

59
00:02:26,046 --> 00:02:28,747
And now, whenever
I'm not watching Sofia,

60
00:02:28,816 --> 00:02:32,751
I just sit alone at
home in my pajamas.

61
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,081
I want to be out of my
pajamas and not alone.

62
00:02:35,105 --> 00:02:37,505
So, go. Meet someone. It's easy.

63
00:02:37,575 --> 00:02:39,285
Oh, it's easy.

64
00:02:39,309 --> 00:02:40,754
Well, what do you
do? What's your line?

65
00:02:40,778 --> 00:02:43,445
I don't use lines.
I'm just honest.

66
00:02:43,513 --> 00:02:44,724
What do you mean "honest"?

67
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:46,615
I don't know.

68
00:02:46,683 --> 00:02:48,750
They start with,
"What do you do?"

69
00:02:48,818 --> 00:02:50,230
And I tell them I'm
a trauma surgeon,

70
00:02:50,254 --> 00:02:53,288
and they wonder
why I chose that.

71
00:02:53,357 --> 00:02:57,024
And I tell them I
served in the war,

72
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:59,661
and I fixed soldiers
on the battlefield,

73
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:02,397
and that was a

74
00:03:02,466 --> 00:03:06,000
really satisfying
way to save lives.

75
00:03:06,069 --> 00:03:07,736
And it still is.

76
00:03:10,974 --> 00:03:12,090
Yeah, that'll do it.

77
00:03:13,677 --> 00:03:16,173
Ah, you've got game, Major Hunt.

78
00:03:16,197 --> 00:03:17,712
It's not a game. It's just...

79
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:20,616
What happened to the couch?

80
00:03:21,151 --> 00:03:22,167
Oh.

81
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:25,604
Hey.

82
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:27,550
Sorry I'm late.
I'm sorry I'm late.

83
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:29,085
<i>Three surgeries today, Robbins.</i>

84
00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:30,787
<i>They're not gonna
round on themselves.</i>

85
00:03:30,811 --> 00:03:32,344
<i>I know. I'm on it.</i>

86
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:35,058
Yeah, Wilson just barged
in and stole my shower.

87
00:03:35,082 --> 00:03:36,692
Edwards, does she
always walk around naked?

88
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:38,076
Not around the
hospital, generally.

89
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:40,713
It's like Residents Gone Wild.

90
00:03:40,737 --> 00:03:42,937
Robbins, do you
live with residents?

91
00:03:43,007 --> 00:03:44,617
<i>Oh, God. Is that thing still on?</i>

92
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:47,676
You're a grown-up. Get your
own place. I need you focused here.

93
00:03:47,744 --> 00:03:49,544
Lie down, Nicole.

94
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:54,098
<i>So, did Wilson just climb
in the shower with you?</i>

95
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:57,386
<i>Yeah. No. Instead of me.</i>

96
00:03:58,455 --> 00:03:59,654
Was she coming on to you?

97
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:00,916
<i>No! Doubtful.</i>

98
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,840
You know what? Can
we just... Let's drop it.

99
00:04:04,177 --> 00:04:07,295
Residents Gone Wild.

100
00:04:07,364 --> 00:04:10,398
<i>Would you go? You're
making her laugh too much.</i>

101
00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:17,989
Mmm. Wow.

102
00:04:18,057 --> 00:04:19,769
I thought you were
going back to the airport.

103
00:04:19,793 --> 00:04:22,394
I just couldn't
get on that plane.

104
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:24,061
Thank you.

105
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:27,015
Thank you for letting
me stay the weekend,

106
00:04:27,901 --> 00:04:29,384
being there for me.

107
00:04:29,453 --> 00:04:31,019
It was just what I needed.

108
00:04:31,087 --> 00:04:33,338
I hate the circumstances,

109
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:37,158
but I'm glad it gave us
a chance to reconnect.

110
00:04:37,227 --> 00:04:39,861
I hear that Jackson and
April are coming in today.

111
00:04:39,929 --> 00:04:41,696
Have you seen him?

112
00:04:45,935 --> 00:04:48,970
Catherine, he asked
you to keep your distance.

113
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:50,572
And I'm honoring that request.

114
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,086
Look, I know how hard
that is for you, okay?

115
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:56,189
But you sent food, you call for
updates. They know you're there.

116
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:58,279
I know. I just hate it.

117
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,216
I'll miss you.

118
00:05:05,105 --> 00:05:08,040
Well, I'll be in the OR, anyway.

119
00:05:08,091 --> 00:05:10,725
I have an open colectomy today.

120
00:05:10,794 --> 00:05:13,028
I could scrub in, do
your ureteral stents.

121
00:05:13,096 --> 00:05:16,214
That'll give us a
little more time.

122
00:05:16,283 --> 00:05:19,017
Hmm... I could make that happen.

123
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:20,218
Make it happen.

124
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:26,288
So, you and Meredith are
getting pretty tight, huh?

125
00:05:26,926 --> 00:05:28,025
What do you mean?

126
00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:29,622
Well, what did she say
about this weekend?

127
00:05:29,646 --> 00:05:30,511
Why? Did she tell you something?

128
00:05:30,581 --> 00:05:32,331
You said she told you.

129
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:35,367
Uh, no, I said she
was about to tell me.

130
00:05:35,436 --> 00:05:37,063
What do you think she
was about to tell you?

131
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:38,327
What did she tell you?

132
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:42,523
Wasn't there a couch there?

133
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:45,221
Don't you want to say something?

134
00:05:45,245 --> 00:05:47,395
This is the closest
thing to a funeral.

135
00:05:47,464 --> 00:05:49,331
No, Dad hated funerals.

136
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:52,334
"Sprinkle me in the woods."

137
00:05:52,402 --> 00:05:54,786
God, he was a pain in the ass.

138
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:56,815
Well, you can't just say that.

139
00:05:59,493 --> 00:06:01,133
You know, one of
his favorite memories

140
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,728
was taking us out here camping.

141
00:06:02,796 --> 00:06:05,897
"We eat what we catch."

142
00:06:05,966 --> 00:06:07,246
"We sleep in what we can carry."

143
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:10,860
Just us men.

144
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:14,206
You okay?

145
00:06:17,911 --> 00:06:19,031
Maybe we should just go.

146
00:06:20,748 --> 00:06:22,914
Hey, race you to the top.

147
00:06:24,817 --> 00:06:27,617
Come on. What you
got? What you got, hmm?

148
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:31,122
Oh, goodness.

149
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,574
It's so muggy. It's
hard to breathe.

150
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:40,198
You okay?

151
00:06:40,267 --> 00:06:42,516
Hey, Curt. You should sit down.

152
00:06:42,603 --> 00:06:44,403
Whoa! Curt! MIRANDA: Curt!

153
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:45,905
Curt!

154
00:06:51,627 --> 00:06:52,777
Call 911!

155
00:07:04,992 --> 00:07:06,970
Hey. How was your weekend?

156
00:07:06,994 --> 00:07:08,192
It was nice. She got some.

157
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:09,706
She doesn't want
to talk about it.

158
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:12,631
Oh, well, I'm glad you
went. I got some, too.

159
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:14,299
Definitely don't want
to talk about that.

160
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:21,130
What do we got?

161
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:22,318
Curtis Warren, post syncope.

162
00:07:22,342 --> 00:07:23,419
Thirty-one.

163
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:24,838
He's still tachycardic,
diaphoretic,

164
00:07:24,862 --> 00:07:26,428
and hypotensive after fainting.

165
00:07:26,496 --> 00:07:28,613
But don't just stand here,
Grey. Give me a hand.

166
00:07:29,582 --> 00:07:30,682
Right over here!

167
00:07:30,751 --> 00:07:32,194
Hillary List,
27-year-old female,

168
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:33,963
found unconscious at the
scene after a pretty bad tumble

169
00:07:33,987 --> 00:07:35,648
down a flight of
concrete stairs in the park.

170
00:07:35,672 --> 00:07:36,999
Hill, honey, I'm right here.

171
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:38,406
Oh, it's all my fault.

172
00:07:38,475 --> 00:07:39,490
This was your fault?

173
00:07:40,243 --> 00:07:41,642
No. No, no, no, no, no.

174
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:44,678
I didn't push her.
I proposed to her.

175
00:07:46,116 --> 00:07:48,899
Okay, let's go to trauma two.

176
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:50,363
Fast scan is negative.

177
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:51,953
Because there's
nothing wrong with me.

178
00:07:53,272 --> 00:07:55,084
Any changes in
your diet recently?

179
00:07:55,108 --> 00:07:57,208
I told them I missed breakfast,

180
00:07:57,276 --> 00:07:59,410
so I was a little
woozy in the woods.

181
00:07:59,462 --> 00:08:01,813
He's still mildly
hypotensive after two liters.

182
00:08:01,882 --> 00:08:02,882
I'm fine.

183
00:08:03,717 --> 00:08:05,183
Ahh!

184
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:07,229
Well, there's definitely
some tenderness there.

185
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:09,754
Well, run his liver enzymes
and get a coag panel.

186
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:11,156
Let's get you into this.

187
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:12,702
You know what? I'm
gonna re-check that...

188
00:08:12,726 --> 00:08:14,254
No! Look, I don't need
to put on this stupid thing.

189
00:08:14,278 --> 00:08:16,122
Would you calm down?
Look, Benji, get off me!

190
00:08:16,146 --> 00:08:17,466
Would you tell them to back off?

191
00:08:17,531 --> 00:08:19,865
Okay, okay. Okay.

192
00:08:19,933 --> 00:08:22,178
Family shouldn't
be in here anyway.

193
00:08:22,202 --> 00:08:23,985
Let's step outside.

194
00:08:24,053 --> 00:08:26,554
You can change, and
I will be back for you.

195
00:08:34,414 --> 00:08:37,315
He's usually a sweetheart.
I'll go talk to him.

196
00:08:37,384 --> 00:08:41,319
Well, Bailey, he's my
patient. I'll take it. You can go.

197
00:08:45,308 --> 00:08:46,807
<i>I took her to the park.</i>

198
00:08:46,876 --> 00:08:49,810
It was where we
had our first date,

199
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:52,079
so I thought that had
a certain symmetry.

200
00:08:52,149 --> 00:08:53,714
I'll order a head CT

201
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:55,444
and an a X-ray for her
right wrist and right knee.

202
00:08:55,468 --> 00:08:58,403
At the top of the stairs,
I got down on my knee

203
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:00,838
and I said,

204
00:09:01,808 --> 00:09:04,909
"Hillary, when I met you,

205
00:09:04,978 --> 00:09:08,079
"I felt like my life
blossomed with fullness.

206
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:12,584
"Like the sun had shone
down on me, baby."

207
00:09:13,987 --> 00:09:15,353
And that's as far as I got.

208
00:09:15,422 --> 00:09:19,257
I had more, but she fainted
and she fell all the way down.

209
00:09:20,027 --> 00:09:21,393
I should've caught her.

210
00:09:22,995 --> 00:09:27,215
Hill? Hill? Hill? Honey?
Honey. Hey, hey, hey. It's me.

211
00:09:27,284 --> 00:09:29,734
Right here. Hey, I'm here.

212
00:09:29,802 --> 00:09:31,168
I'm never leaving your side.

213
00:09:31,221 --> 00:09:34,072
I'll never ever leave you.

214
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,990
I'll never...

215
00:09:37,694 --> 00:09:39,060
Oh, she's out again.

216
00:09:39,129 --> 00:09:40,445
Hill? Hill? Hillary?

217
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:42,041
Todd, we're gonna
admit her now. Yeah.

218
00:09:42,065 --> 00:09:44,466
So, Dr. Wilson's gonna show
you where you can wait, okay?

219
00:09:44,534 --> 00:09:46,134
And page neuro. I'm here.

220
00:09:46,202 --> 00:09:47,902
Todd.

221
00:09:47,971 --> 00:09:50,738
I'll just... I'm just gonna
be over here, baby.

222
00:09:50,806 --> 00:09:53,124
Dr. Herman, you scheduled
another surgery for tomorrow?

223
00:09:53,193 --> 00:09:54,242
I thought we said...

224
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:57,044
Yes, the Larsen mom. Sorry.

225
00:09:59,866 --> 00:10:02,016
Is this the attendings'
lounge couch?

226
00:10:02,085 --> 00:10:03,868
It was.

227
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:06,371
Dr. Herman, please stop
making me be this guy.

228
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,139
You can't just steal
hospital furniture.

229
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:12,093
I need this couch. This is
the best couch in the building.

230
00:10:12,162 --> 00:10:14,445
It's firm, but soft.

231
00:10:14,514 --> 00:10:15,613
Bouncy.

232
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:18,232
Responsive.

233
00:10:18,301 --> 00:10:20,068
Would you like to try it out?

234
00:10:21,437 --> 00:10:24,623
Well, um... I think that's...

235
00:10:24,691 --> 00:10:28,409
I appreciate the offer, but I...

236
00:10:28,478 --> 00:10:30,978
Uh, Hunt. I'm messing with you.

237
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:33,693
Larsen's gonna be a quick in and out.
- 30, OR six.

238
00:10:33,717 --> 00:10:34,894
Is that fine with you?
That's fine, yeah.

239
00:10:34,918 --> 00:10:36,968
And...

240
00:10:37,036 --> 00:10:39,721
Was that a "no" on
trying out the couch?

241
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:46,978
Hey. So, I'm good to go?

242
00:10:47,047 --> 00:10:49,664
Curt, your liver enzymes,
they're off the charts.

243
00:10:49,733 --> 00:10:51,766
Any idea why that might be?

244
00:10:51,835 --> 00:10:53,913
I got to reminiscing
about Dad last night.

245
00:10:53,937 --> 00:10:55,414
Maybe one too
many whisky toasts.

246
00:10:55,438 --> 00:10:56,988
Okay, I'm gonna get a CT.

247
00:10:57,056 --> 00:10:58,256
Oh, come on.

248
00:11:01,728 --> 00:11:03,394
Listen...

249
00:11:03,462 --> 00:11:04,702
What are you getting at?

250
00:11:04,731 --> 00:11:06,113
I ran some extra tests,

251
00:11:06,182 --> 00:11:08,700
because what I was seeing
wasn't making any sense.

252
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:10,718
Your lab results for
a 30-year-old man

253
00:11:10,787 --> 00:11:11,986
are not normal,

254
00:11:12,055 --> 00:11:14,122
and you had the estrogen
levels of a young woman.

255
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:19,119
I just want to know what you're
dealing with so I can help you.

256
00:11:22,031 --> 00:11:23,798
Hillary, the scans
show that the fall

257
00:11:23,866 --> 00:11:26,501
caused an artery
under your skull to bleed.

258
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:28,636
You'll need
surgery to repair it.

259
00:11:28,705 --> 00:11:31,589
And then Dr. Wilson and I will
repair the fracture in your knee.

260
00:11:31,658 --> 00:11:33,369
But none of this explains
why you passed out.

261
00:11:33,393 --> 00:11:34,653
Has this ever happened before?

262
00:11:34,677 --> 00:11:35,743
Fainting, dizzy spells?

263
00:11:35,811 --> 00:11:37,178
No, never.

264
00:11:37,246 --> 00:11:40,065
Uh... Todd said that it
happened a couple of times.

265
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:41,961
You were talking on
the couch and then you...

266
00:11:41,985 --> 00:11:43,968
I just nodded off.

267
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:46,382
Well, I'd like to run a complete
neuro work-up to find out...

268
00:11:46,406 --> 00:11:47,599
Is that really necessary?

269
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:48,623
I know it's scary,

270
00:11:48,691 --> 00:11:49,952
but multiple fainting
spells can mean

271
00:11:49,976 --> 00:11:51,187
a lot of things,
heart problems...

272
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:52,410
It's not that.

273
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:53,806
I'm also concerned about
narcolepsy, cataplexy...

274
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:56,447
No, no! There's no plexies.

275
00:11:56,516 --> 00:11:57,765
I didn't faint.

276
00:11:57,834 --> 00:12:00,018
Not on the couch,
not on the stairs.

277
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:01,920
Okay, well, Todd said that...

278
00:12:01,988 --> 00:12:03,688
I faked it.

279
00:12:03,757 --> 00:12:05,568
I faked fainting
when he proposed

280
00:12:05,592 --> 00:12:07,870
because I didn't
know how to say no

281
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:10,995
without breaking his
tender, little, quivering heart.

282
00:12:13,617 --> 00:12:14,849
Whoa.

283
00:12:17,253 --> 00:12:19,687
We should scrub in
together more often.

284
00:12:19,756 --> 00:12:23,491
I could come to you on occasion.

285
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:26,644
I'm thinking he will need
a component separation.

286
00:12:26,713 --> 00:12:28,491
I'll call in a plastics consult.

287
00:12:28,515 --> 00:12:30,448
No, he's fine.
There's hardly any...

288
00:12:30,517 --> 00:12:31,610
Page Dr. Avery, please.

289
00:12:31,634 --> 00:12:33,401
Uh-huh. You got it.

290
00:12:33,469 --> 00:12:37,154
If there's good news and bad
news, I want the good news first.

291
00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:38,656
Okay.

292
00:12:38,725 --> 00:12:40,870
The good news is, a person
can live without a spleen.

293
00:12:40,894 --> 00:12:42,054
Oh.

294
00:12:42,562 --> 00:12:43,639
Wow.

295
00:12:43,663 --> 00:12:45,129
I'm removing yours today.

296
00:12:45,197 --> 00:12:48,099
The CT showed your
spleen is remarkably swollen.

297
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:49,979
It's probably due to a
clot in the splenic vein...

298
00:12:50,003 --> 00:12:51,352
Are you on drugs?

299
00:12:51,421 --> 00:12:53,065
Coke or something?
Benji, come on.

300
00:12:53,089 --> 00:12:54,417
'Cause I'm looking
at this organ damage

301
00:12:54,441 --> 00:12:55,721
and I don't know what to think.

302
00:12:57,527 --> 00:12:59,487
Do you have any idea
what it could be, Dr. Grey?

303
00:13:01,664 --> 00:13:03,597
Okay. Curt.

304
00:13:04,467 --> 00:13:05,833
Don't be stupid.

305
00:13:05,902 --> 00:13:07,902
All right, if you're in trouble,

306
00:13:07,988 --> 00:13:09,887
you can tell me, whatever it is.

307
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:11,589
You know that.

308
00:13:11,658 --> 00:13:14,625
Ben. You know me.

309
00:13:14,694 --> 00:13:15,894
I don't do drugs.

310
00:13:16,846 --> 00:13:18,413
I never have.

311
00:13:22,702 --> 00:13:24,017
Can you make that call?

312
00:13:24,086 --> 00:13:26,621
He wouldn't lie to me.
Drugs are off the table.

313
00:13:26,706 --> 00:13:30,241
But it's something, so try
thinking like a doctor, not his...

314
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:31,809
I am thinking like a doctor.

315
00:13:31,878 --> 00:13:33,744
Maybe there's a
genetic component.

316
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:36,263
My father just died of colon
cancer. Maybe we start there.

317
00:13:36,332 --> 00:13:38,277
I don't think it's his colon.

318
00:13:38,301 --> 00:13:40,150
You got a better idea?

319
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:42,052
All right, then we
start running tests.

320
00:13:42,121 --> 00:13:44,822
Look, I just lost
my dad, Miranda.

321
00:13:44,891 --> 00:13:47,091
I'm not gonna lose
my brother, too.

322
00:13:47,143 --> 00:13:48,509
Mmm-hmm. Just...

323
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:57,947
Okay, is this
what I think it is?

324
00:13:57,971 --> 00:13:59,370
What do you think it is?

325
00:13:59,438 --> 00:14:02,156
I'm not blind, Grey. My
husband might be, but I'm not.

326
00:14:02,224 --> 00:14:06,093
Now, he has no hair
on his chest or arms.

327
00:14:06,162 --> 00:14:07,612
He waxes his eyebrows.

328
00:14:07,664 --> 00:14:09,358
I'd kill to have
eyebrows like that.

329
00:14:09,382 --> 00:14:12,550
And then I'm looking at these
numbers and the splenic damage,

330
00:14:12,619 --> 00:14:15,002
is he doing what
I think he's doing?

331
00:14:15,071 --> 00:14:16,654
You have to ask Curt.

332
00:14:26,066 --> 00:14:27,765
Nurses' station.

333
00:14:32,722 --> 00:14:35,723
That Zola, she could
play Go Fish all night long.

334
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:38,159
You have a budding
card shark on your hands.

335
00:14:38,227 --> 00:14:40,006
Yeah, well, we
eventually hide the cards.

336
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:41,941
It's the only way she'll stop.

337
00:14:41,965 --> 00:14:45,033
I'll have to remember
that for next time.

338
00:14:45,101 --> 00:14:48,069
Look, I just want
to say that, um...

339
00:14:48,138 --> 00:14:52,323
I am not here to judge
you, but I'm a bad liar. So...

340
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:54,386
I don't know what
you're talking about.

341
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:56,177
You packed a
suitcase full of lingerie

342
00:14:56,246 --> 00:14:58,312
and you went away
for the weekend.

343
00:14:58,381 --> 00:15:00,281
Yeah, I...

344
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:02,962
And then Derek called me three
times asking where you were.

345
00:15:02,986 --> 00:15:04,618
Meanwhile, you
texted me telling me

346
00:15:04,687 --> 00:15:06,420
what a great time
you were having.

347
00:15:06,489 --> 00:15:09,106
So, whatever you
were doing, whoever,

348
00:15:09,175 --> 00:15:11,809
he, she, they, whatever,

349
00:15:13,179 --> 00:15:15,879
it wasn't with
him, and that's all.

350
00:15:17,317 --> 00:15:19,150
I want to be here for you,

351
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:23,587
but I like Derek
and I hate lying.

352
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:28,293
Grey! Pierce! Get in here!

353
00:15:28,361 --> 00:15:31,011
Okay, okay. It's okay.

354
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,658
Call the OR. Let them
know we're coming now!

355
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:33,762
Oh, God, Curt!

356
00:15:34,951 --> 00:15:36,184
Robbins. Let's go scrub.

357
00:15:36,252 --> 00:15:37,518
Coming.

358
00:15:37,587 --> 00:15:39,787
Listen, just talk to her,
and maybe buy her a robe.

359
00:15:39,856 --> 00:15:41,433
Why would I do that?

360
00:15:41,457 --> 00:15:43,657
Was this about
the naked resident?

361
00:15:43,727 --> 00:15:44,937
Ooh, you and
Wilson, you're a thing.

362
00:15:44,961 --> 00:15:46,127
You know what? Let's not.

363
00:15:46,196 --> 00:15:48,174
And Robbins can get
handsy with the residents.

364
00:15:48,198 --> 00:15:49,697
Really? I do not!

365
00:15:49,766 --> 00:15:51,677
Last year, she got handsy.

366
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:53,445
HR got involved.
There are policies now.

367
00:15:54,804 --> 00:15:57,705
Because of you?
Robbins, that's incredible.

368
00:15:57,774 --> 00:16:00,658
It's not. Both of
you, stop, okay?

369
00:16:00,726 --> 00:16:02,226
Alex, it's inappropriate.

370
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:04,689
She's a resident. I'm her
superior. I'm a girl who likes girls.

371
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:06,324
It just puts us both in a
very awkward position,

372
00:16:06,348 --> 00:16:07,765
and you should respect that.

373
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:08,682
Well, I'm kind of down
for whatever happens.

374
00:16:08,751 --> 00:16:10,184
I'm gonna kill you.

375
00:16:10,253 --> 00:16:11,796
Hey. Hey.

376
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,298
You need to start putting
on pants around the house

377
00:16:13,322 --> 00:16:14,566
'cause Robbins keeps
checking out your ass.

378
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:16,907
No. No. Alex, no.

379
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:19,660
You don't need to put pants
on, okay? Your ass is fine.

380
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:20,845
See? That's reportable.

381
00:16:20,914 --> 00:16:22,963
No! I...

382
00:16:23,032 --> 00:16:24,798
I hate you all.

383
00:16:24,867 --> 00:16:25,907
I have surgery.

384
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:28,636
This is the best day.

385
00:16:30,106 --> 00:16:33,474
Oh, God, I'm awful.

386
00:16:33,543 --> 00:16:35,755
There is nothing
wrong with Todd.

387
00:16:35,779 --> 00:16:38,011
He's nice and he's stable

388
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:42,249
and he cares for me deeply.

389
00:16:42,318 --> 00:16:43,396
So deeply.

390
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,648
And he's clingy,
and he loves to...

391
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:47,082
I don't even know
what to call it,

392
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:49,189
but he likes to pet me.

393
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:52,020
It's really soft, and it... Ugh!

394
00:16:52,662 --> 00:16:54,428
He's boring.

395
00:16:54,497 --> 00:16:56,125
So, I just started
doing this thing

396
00:16:56,149 --> 00:16:59,199
where I pretend to
faint so he'll stop talking.

397
00:17:00,036 --> 00:17:01,936
Wow, that is...

398
00:17:03,873 --> 00:17:05,050
Diabolical.

399
00:17:05,074 --> 00:17:07,191
Why don't you just
tell him the truth?

400
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,826
Because it would kill him.

401
00:17:08,895 --> 00:17:11,640
I mean, he wants to take
things to the next level,

402
00:17:11,664 --> 00:17:14,465
but the more that
he feels, the less I do.

403
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:18,803
And then today, we were in the
park, and he got down on one knee

404
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:21,083
and he looked up at
me with his big wet eyes,

405
00:17:21,107 --> 00:17:22,968
so I just... Faked it.

406
00:17:22,992 --> 00:17:26,026
I didn't realize how
close I was to the steps.

407
00:17:26,095 --> 00:17:29,380
But I had to go with
it all the way down.

408
00:17:30,683 --> 00:17:32,099
You can really commit.

409
00:17:32,167 --> 00:17:33,601
Yeah.

410
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:35,519
But not to Todd.

411
00:17:38,657 --> 00:17:40,535
Shepherd, how's Herman?

412
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,260
Any changes to the tumor?

413
00:17:42,328 --> 00:17:44,228
Uh, it's grown
a little inferiorly.

414
00:17:44,297 --> 00:17:46,075
But it's still within the
margins I expected.

415
00:17:46,099 --> 00:17:47,198
Why?

416
00:17:47,267 --> 00:17:48,344
I was just checking.

417
00:17:48,368 --> 00:17:49,967
Actually, um...

418
00:17:51,304 --> 00:17:52,936
Her behavior is...

419
00:17:53,973 --> 00:17:55,013
She's stealing furniture.

420
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,340
Oh.

421
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:59,076
And she was flirting with me.

422
00:18:00,229 --> 00:18:01,323
Herman flirted with you?

423
00:18:01,347 --> 00:18:02,880
I think so.

424
00:18:02,948 --> 00:18:06,133
I... Yeah.

425
00:18:06,201 --> 00:18:07,668
Did you take her up on it?

426
00:18:07,737 --> 00:18:09,636
I mean, she's very attractive.

427
00:18:09,706 --> 00:18:11,989
No. Yes, she is...

428
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:13,307
And tall.

429
00:18:13,376 --> 00:18:16,511
I mean, she might be the
tallest person in the hospital.

430
00:18:16,579 --> 00:18:18,624
You might find tall people
attractive. I don't know.

431
00:18:18,648 --> 00:18:19,814
No, I don't.

432
00:18:19,883 --> 00:18:22,149
Not as a rule,

433
00:18:22,218 --> 00:18:23,778
but professionally,
it's not a good idea.

434
00:18:23,802 --> 00:18:26,537
Is that a rule? No co-workers?

435
00:18:26,589 --> 00:18:27,821
Didn't say that.

436
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:29,940
I like co-workers.

437
00:18:30,009 --> 00:18:32,810
But the hospital, we
have rules that are, um...

438
00:18:34,547 --> 00:18:36,880
Thank you for the update.

439
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,286
You wanted a consult?

440
00:18:42,355 --> 00:18:44,395
Not me. CATHERINE: Me.

441
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,323
Mom.

442
00:18:46,992 --> 00:18:48,826
I asked you to go.

443
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:52,730
I need you to take a look
at this incision, sweetheart.

444
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,533
She's not just trying to
check on me and April?

445
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:57,401
Don't look at me.
I got played, too.

446
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,484
They just took him in.

447
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:03,840
How the hell did this happen?

448
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:05,820
He was sitting up and
talking to me an hour ago.

449
00:19:05,844 --> 00:19:07,711
Well, we knew about the spleen.

450
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,525
It made his stomach
muscles bleed,

451
00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:11,293
but Pierce will clip
them and Grey...

452
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:13,395
You were right. You
were right about the drugs.

453
00:19:13,419 --> 00:19:16,086
I didn't want to believe
it at first, but it's obvious.

454
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:17,321
He's using.

455
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:18,567
Okay, now, we shouldn't jump...

456
00:19:18,591 --> 00:19:20,023
I'll get him in rehab.

457
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:22,326
As soon as he can
walk out of here, I'm...

458
00:19:22,395 --> 00:19:23,694
Ben, wait.

459
00:19:23,762 --> 00:19:26,730
What do you think
it is? Coke? Crystal?

460
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:29,349
Come on, you're usually
right about these things.

461
00:19:29,952 --> 00:19:31,351
Tell me.

462
00:19:31,421 --> 00:19:33,120
I think

463
00:19:33,188 --> 00:19:35,055
you should talk to Curt.

464
00:19:37,627 --> 00:19:39,609
Is there something
you're not telling me?

465
00:19:39,662 --> 00:19:42,213
After surgery, he'll
tell you everything.

466
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:44,348
Tell me what? Miranda.

467
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:46,016
Just talk to him. He'll...

468
00:19:46,085 --> 00:19:47,562
But what if I don't
get the chance to?

469
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:49,264
What if he doesn't
come out of surgery?

470
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:50,899
Oh, that's nonsense.
Now, just calm down.

471
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:52,056
Calm down?

472
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:53,735
I'm being lied to by my brother,

473
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:55,304
and now I'm being
lied to by my wife.

474
00:19:55,328 --> 00:19:56,560
I'm not lying to you.

475
00:19:56,628 --> 00:19:57,772
Well, no one's telling
me the damn truth!

476
00:19:57,796 --> 00:19:59,230
I'll tell you!

477
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:03,033
It's only because
when he tells you,

478
00:20:03,102 --> 00:20:04,813
you need to react better
than this, Ben Warren.

479
00:20:04,837 --> 00:20:05,917
What is it?

480
00:20:06,923 --> 00:20:09,690
Okay, Curt is...

481
00:20:09,758 --> 00:20:11,525
Curt is transitioning.

482
00:20:11,593 --> 00:20:13,327
He...

483
00:20:13,395 --> 00:20:16,764
She is transgender.

484
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:19,700
And she identifies as female,

485
00:20:19,769 --> 00:20:22,420
and she wants to
live life as a woman.

486
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:27,307
Your brother is
becoming your sister.

487
00:20:33,683 --> 00:20:35,750
Oh, my God.

488
00:20:36,753 --> 00:20:37,993
Oh, that son of a bitch.

489
00:20:38,021 --> 00:20:39,470
He put you up to this?

490
00:20:56,238 --> 00:20:58,255
Bleeding is controlled.

491
00:20:58,324 --> 00:21:01,425
Clamping the hilum.
Suture ligature.

492
00:21:01,493 --> 00:21:03,661
So, what did you
say when he called?

493
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:07,130
The first time, I said that
you were in the shower.

494
00:21:08,234 --> 00:21:11,385
Ligating the gastric vessels.

495
00:21:11,453 --> 00:21:14,566
The second time, I said
you were taking a nap.

496
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:16,056
And the third time,

497
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:20,311
I said Hunt called you in for
an emergent rectal abscess.

498
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:22,479
I hate lying.

499
00:21:22,548 --> 00:21:24,908
I didn't want to spoil anything.

500
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:31,466
I need to dissect the
splenorenal ligament.

501
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:32,490
Metz.

502
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:42,099
Hey, okay.

503
00:21:42,168 --> 00:21:44,368
Pierce just controlled the
gastric bleeds with clips,

504
00:21:44,437 --> 00:21:47,237
and now Grey is finishing
taking out the spleen.

505
00:21:47,307 --> 00:21:49,774
All right, now, he's
upset about Dad.

506
00:21:49,842 --> 00:21:52,543
He's obviously having some
sort of emotional breakdown,

507
00:21:52,612 --> 00:21:53,722
so we'll get him
a psych consult.

508
00:21:53,746 --> 00:21:55,312
No, we won't.

509
00:21:55,381 --> 00:21:57,864
Curt's crazy. This
makes no sense.

510
00:21:57,933 --> 00:22:00,144
All right, the only thing that
does make sense right now

511
00:22:00,168 --> 00:22:02,836
is that after the surgery,
you will talk to Curt.

512
00:22:02,905 --> 00:22:04,983
Yeah. And you
will listen to Curt

513
00:22:05,007 --> 00:22:08,826
tell you her good news,
and it is good news.

514
00:22:08,894 --> 00:22:12,963
And you will listen, and you
will tell her that you love her

515
00:22:13,032 --> 00:22:17,651
and tell her that you'll
always be here for her.

516
00:22:17,719 --> 00:22:20,720
Okay, so after the fetoscope is
inserted, then I will deploy the shunt,

517
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:22,522
and you'll manipulate
the camera, right?

518
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:23,668
You're a hypocrite.

519
00:22:23,692 --> 00:22:25,292
I beg your pardon?

520
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,061
You were so high and mighty
when I was boffing Graham.

521
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:30,608
Which one was it? Which
resident did you sully?

522
00:22:30,632 --> 00:22:33,033
Oh, God. I knew
that you would...

523
00:22:33,102 --> 00:22:36,782
You can't suddenly become
interesting and then clam up.

524
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:39,205
It was a year ago,
and she's gone now.

525
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:41,992
Weren't you married
last year? Yes.

526
00:22:42,061 --> 00:22:43,694
No. Well, we were broken up.

527
00:22:43,763 --> 00:22:45,111
I thought you just split.

528
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:47,230
This was a different...

529
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:48,649
I cheated on Callie, okay?

530
00:22:48,717 --> 00:22:50,929
Oh, my God. How have
you been hiding this from me?

531
00:22:50,953 --> 00:22:52,385
Hiding what?

532
00:22:52,455 --> 00:22:54,438
The dirt. You're dirty.

533
00:22:55,807 --> 00:22:57,386
And here I thought
you were no fun at all.

534
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:58,475
Oh, stop it. I'm...

535
00:22:58,527 --> 00:23:00,461
You're a dirty, dirty girl.

536
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:02,870
You're dirty.

537
00:23:08,437 --> 00:23:10,838
Minimal swelling. I like that.

538
00:23:10,906 --> 00:23:12,417
Hey, can I get an ETA
on when you're closing

539
00:23:12,441 --> 00:23:13,485
just so I can prep the leg?

540
00:23:13,509 --> 00:23:15,059
One last vessel here.

541
00:23:15,127 --> 00:23:17,995
So, she threw herself
down a flight of stairs

542
00:23:18,064 --> 00:23:20,581
just to avoid telling
him yes or no?

543
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:21,915
Mm-hmm.

544
00:23:21,984 --> 00:23:23,328
Have you met the boyfriend?

545
00:23:23,352 --> 00:23:24,997
Wilson, go let him know that

546
00:23:25,021 --> 00:23:26,615
her brain surgery
was successful.

547
00:23:26,639 --> 00:23:27,783
Bring tissues.

548
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:31,008
Poor guy.

549
00:23:31,077 --> 00:23:32,592
Poor guy?

550
00:23:32,662 --> 00:23:34,840
I'm sewing her
brain shut right now.

551
00:23:34,864 --> 00:23:36,104
Oh, Todd's the problem here?

552
00:23:36,132 --> 00:23:38,833
Why? 'Cause he cares too
much? He feels too much?

553
00:23:38,901 --> 00:23:41,435
He's willing to devote
himself fully to another person.

554
00:23:41,504 --> 00:23:43,437
That's the problem?

555
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:46,239
If it makes the other person
want to pass out, yeah.

556
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:50,139
Well, then that's it. That's why
I can't pick people up anymore,

557
00:23:50,163 --> 00:23:52,629
because I don't know
how to put them back down.

558
00:23:52,698 --> 00:23:54,631
That's why I have no game.

559
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:58,602
I Used to have game.
I had such game.

560
00:23:58,671 --> 00:24:00,370
Yeah?

561
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:03,707
I used to be fun and cool
and sexy and go to bars

562
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:06,154
and do this thing where
you make eye contact once

563
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:07,511
and look away.

564
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:10,447
Just reel them
in without a word.

565
00:24:10,516 --> 00:24:12,132
Such game.

566
00:24:13,552 --> 00:24:14,952
Hey, what was your secret?

567
00:24:16,171 --> 00:24:18,572
Drugs. I was on drugs. Mmm.

568
00:24:18,641 --> 00:24:20,802
So, I'm leaving out the
terrible, terrible repercussions,

569
00:24:20,826 --> 00:24:23,638
but ever since I got off
the drugs, I've gotten worse.

570
00:24:23,662 --> 00:24:26,646
Now I'm just all mumbling
and vomiting words

571
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:29,849
and no cool, no
sexy, no game at all.

572
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:32,269
Same here. Game over.

573
00:24:33,406 --> 00:24:35,517
I want to be clear.
I am in no way

574
00:24:35,541 --> 00:24:37,924
endorsing narcotics
as a dating aid.

575
00:24:37,993 --> 00:24:39,326
Understood.

576
00:24:39,395 --> 00:24:40,856
So, dinner's coming?

577
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,229
Yes, Mom.

578
00:24:42,297 --> 00:24:44,431
You still haven't
told me. How's April?

579
00:24:44,499 --> 00:24:46,984
Mom, she's all right.

580
00:24:47,052 --> 00:24:48,886
And I'm fine. We're doing okay.

581
00:24:48,955 --> 00:24:51,037
Mm-hmm.

582
00:24:51,106 --> 00:24:52,551
I don't believe
that for one second.

583
00:24:52,575 --> 00:24:53,836
Mom, what do you want me to say?

584
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:57,561
Mom, she's sad, obviously.
April is angry, okay?

585
00:24:57,630 --> 00:25:01,765
About the baby, about God.
She just needs her space.

586
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:05,269
And I can't help her.
I just make her crazy,

587
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:07,471
which just makes
me feel useless.

588
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:08,850
She doesn't need space

589
00:25:08,874 --> 00:25:10,874
so much as the
illusion of space.

590
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:13,310
You should do what I do.

591
00:25:13,378 --> 00:25:15,846
Stay out of her
way, but not too far.

592
00:25:15,915 --> 00:25:17,764
Find something else
to occupy your mind.

593
00:25:17,833 --> 00:25:19,799
Work is good.

594
00:25:19,868 --> 00:25:23,703
Yeah, be close,
but just out of sight.

595
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:27,874
And you'll be there for
her when she's ready.

596
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:32,145
Okay, I'm pretty sure what
you just described is stalking.

597
00:25:32,214 --> 00:25:34,281
Your abdominal
closure should be fine.

598
00:25:37,436 --> 00:25:39,414
Is that what this
weekend was for you?

599
00:25:39,438 --> 00:25:42,039
Something else to
occupy your mind?

600
00:25:45,778 --> 00:25:47,639
I'm not cheating on my husband.

601
00:25:47,663 --> 00:25:48,879
Then where were you?

602
00:25:48,947 --> 00:25:50,275
It's really not that big a deal.

603
00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:52,766
Then why are you
being so weird about it?

604
00:25:52,835 --> 00:25:54,201
You have to tell me something.

605
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:55,619
I have to?

606
00:25:55,671 --> 00:25:56,671
I lied for you.

607
00:25:56,739 --> 00:25:58,783
I'm sorry if I put
you in a position

608
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:00,752
where you felt like
you had to lie for me,

609
00:26:00,776 --> 00:26:02,954
but that doesn't make
this any of your business.

610
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:07,147
Okay, maybe not. I just...

611
00:26:07,215 --> 00:26:10,283
I thought we were
finally getting somewhere.

612
00:26:10,352 --> 00:26:11,832
You trusted me with your kids.

613
00:26:11,887 --> 00:26:13,332
I trust my babysitter
with my kids.

614
00:26:13,356 --> 00:26:15,556
That doesn't mean I
owe her my life story.

615
00:26:18,627 --> 00:26:19,993
Pierce, I'm sorry.

616
00:26:20,062 --> 00:26:21,756
No. No, it's fine. It's fine.
That came out wrong.

617
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,480
You're right. Just
do me a favor.

618
00:26:23,549 --> 00:26:25,249
Next time, call your babysitter.

619
00:26:25,317 --> 00:26:26,983
Leave me out of it.

620
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:36,109
Oh, there she is.
Are you all right?

621
00:26:36,178 --> 00:26:37,889
How is she? Is
she all well again?

622
00:26:37,913 --> 00:26:40,831
She's gonna be fine. Both
surgeries went very well.

623
00:26:40,883 --> 00:26:43,032
Thank you. Thank you.

624
00:26:43,952 --> 00:26:46,687
Hill. I'm gonna take you home.

625
00:26:46,755 --> 00:26:48,567
I'm gonna make
sure that you have

626
00:26:48,591 --> 00:26:50,368
everything you need, all right?

627
00:26:50,392 --> 00:26:52,159
You tell him right now.

628
00:26:56,248 --> 00:26:57,847
Todd.

629
00:26:57,916 --> 00:27:03,036
You have been so sweet,
and you have been so kind,

630
00:27:03,105 --> 00:27:05,489
and I have been unfair to you.

631
00:27:05,557 --> 00:27:06,857
No, no.

632
00:27:06,909 --> 00:27:08,308
No, don't worry about me.

633
00:27:09,812 --> 00:27:12,312
I love you. I'm right here.

634
00:27:13,682 --> 00:27:15,282
And I'm never leaving you.

635
00:27:16,719 --> 00:27:17,719
Ever.

636
00:27:19,788 --> 00:27:21,388
Oh, Hillary. Hillary?

637
00:27:21,457 --> 00:27:22,989
Hillary? She fainted!

638
00:27:24,392 --> 00:27:25,436
Help her!

639
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:26,977
For God's sake.

640
00:27:27,046 --> 00:27:28,606
She can't take
another fall like that.

641
00:27:28,648 --> 00:27:31,181
Todd, what Hillary's
trying to tell you

642
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:33,684
is that she wants
to break up with you.

643
00:27:33,753 --> 00:27:35,786
What? I'm so sorry.

644
00:27:35,855 --> 00:27:38,266
I know that all you want is to
help her, but she doesn't want that.

645
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:40,490
She doesn't deserve it.
She's faking this right now.

646
00:27:42,411 --> 00:27:44,055
What? Todd...

647
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:48,515
You deserve someone who
wants you there, you know?

648
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:50,829
Um... Someone
who needs the kind of

649
00:27:50,853 --> 00:27:53,019
attention that
only you can give,

650
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:57,223
and it's not gonna be Hillary,
okay, and it shouldn't be.

651
00:27:57,292 --> 00:27:59,192
And you will be
fine without her,

652
00:27:59,261 --> 00:28:02,128
and it may take a while
to find the right person,

653
00:28:02,197 --> 00:28:03,430
but you will find her.

654
00:28:03,499 --> 00:28:05,064
You should start looking, okay?

655
00:28:05,134 --> 00:28:08,602
She's right. Don't waste
another minute. Start right now.

656
00:28:19,648 --> 00:28:20,780
There.

657
00:28:20,849 --> 00:28:22,099
Thank you.

658
00:28:25,354 --> 00:28:28,388
Just tell me, where is
this all coming from?

659
00:28:29,758 --> 00:28:32,792
It's coming from
me. This is who I am.

660
00:28:32,861 --> 00:28:34,277
Since when?

661
00:28:34,346 --> 00:28:36,346
I mean, what, you
just suddenly decided...

662
00:28:36,415 --> 00:28:39,949
Benji, I've known
since I was five.

663
00:28:40,018 --> 00:28:41,885
Five?

664
00:28:41,953 --> 00:28:44,632
Because, you know, I wanted to
play for the Bears when I was five,

665
00:28:44,656 --> 00:28:47,725
because you don't know
crap when you're five.

666
00:28:47,793 --> 00:28:49,460
I knew this.

667
00:28:49,511 --> 00:28:51,278
Yeah, but why didn't I know it?

668
00:28:51,347 --> 00:28:55,081
We shared a room for 18 years.

669
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:57,662
You ever have that dream
where you're pushed out on stage

670
00:28:57,686 --> 00:29:01,105
and everybody knows
their lines except you?

671
00:29:01,173 --> 00:29:06,326
And you're in some costume
or you're naked or whatever.

672
00:29:06,395 --> 00:29:09,129
And you're just trapped
there. You can't...

673
00:29:10,733 --> 00:29:12,499
That was my whole life.

674
00:29:12,568 --> 00:29:14,801
Every day of my
life, pretending.

675
00:29:18,223 --> 00:29:20,523
Benji, I'm tired of pretending.

676
00:29:22,094 --> 00:29:26,062
I just want to be
happy with who I am.

677
00:29:28,601 --> 00:29:31,618
Can you understand that?

678
00:29:31,687 --> 00:29:34,621
So, now you give a
damn about what I think?

679
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:36,973
Now suddenly it matters
that I understand?

680
00:29:37,042 --> 00:29:38,642
You know it does.

681
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:40,994
I'm just supposed
to be okay with this?

682
00:29:41,063 --> 00:29:44,214
I'm just supposed
to accept this?

683
00:29:50,856 --> 00:29:52,055
What...

684
00:29:53,142 --> 00:29:54,285
Okay, I'll go talk to him.

685
00:29:54,309 --> 00:29:55,549
Don't bother.

686
00:29:57,946 --> 00:30:00,613
How soon do you think
I can get out of here?

687
00:30:06,305 --> 00:30:08,883
I don't imagine you
need a ride to the airport.

688
00:30:08,907 --> 00:30:10,307
I have a car.

689
00:30:11,843 --> 00:30:13,510
What are you doing?

690
00:30:13,579 --> 00:30:16,413
You scrub in with me,
you take over the OR,

691
00:30:16,482 --> 00:30:18,193
so you can call your
son on a phony consult?

692
00:30:18,217 --> 00:30:19,494
I needed to know
how he was doing.

693
00:30:19,518 --> 00:30:20,595
I'm talking about us.

694
00:30:20,619 --> 00:30:22,619
What about us, Richard?

695
00:30:22,688 --> 00:30:23,965
It looks like you
got what you wanted

696
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:25,200
and you're running out the door.

697
00:30:25,224 --> 00:30:26,590
You used me.

698
00:30:26,659 --> 00:30:28,970
I seem to recall your saying,
"I use people all the time."

699
00:30:28,994 --> 00:30:30,860
Cristina Yang, the Harper Avery.

700
00:30:30,929 --> 00:30:32,929
So, why are you
so surprised now?

701
00:30:32,998 --> 00:30:34,425
I was angry when
I said those things.

702
00:30:34,449 --> 00:30:36,616
And I was angry
when I heard them.

703
00:30:40,806 --> 00:30:44,041
I thought after the
last few days, I...

704
00:30:44,109 --> 00:30:46,393
I thought we'd
moved on from that.

705
00:30:46,462 --> 00:30:51,198
Richard, you were here
for me in a terrible time.

706
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:54,734
I appreciate that,
but I'm still me,

707
00:30:54,803 --> 00:30:57,137
and you're not
okay with who I am.

708
00:30:57,205 --> 00:30:59,339
One minute, you find a
powerful woman attractive,

709
00:30:59,408 --> 00:31:01,742
the next minute,
your feelings are hurt.

710
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:03,543
You can't have it both ways.

711
00:31:03,612 --> 00:31:07,447
You're gonna have to figure that
out before we move on anywhere.

712
00:31:20,412 --> 00:31:23,296
I went to the airport,
I got through security,

713
00:31:23,365 --> 00:31:24,665
I went up to the gate,

714
00:31:24,733 --> 00:31:28,201
they called my boarding
group, and I just stood there.

715
00:31:28,269 --> 00:31:31,571
I froze. I didn't
get on the plane.

716
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:34,107
I watched the plane take
off from behind the glass,

717
00:31:34,175 --> 00:31:36,226
I got in my car, and I left.

718
00:31:37,379 --> 00:31:39,045
Oh, Meredith.

719
00:31:39,113 --> 00:31:41,648
I didn't know how to tell anyone

720
00:31:41,717 --> 00:31:46,252
that I didn't get on the
plane to visit my husband.

721
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:49,189
So, I drove to one of
those hotels by the airport.

722
00:31:49,257 --> 00:31:52,242
And you stayed there
by yourself all weekend?

723
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:53,876
Yeah.

724
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:56,958
You were
embarrassed, so you hid.

725
00:31:56,982 --> 00:31:59,816
I kind of get that.

726
00:31:59,885 --> 00:32:01,679
Well, it's... No, no, it's okay.

727
00:32:01,703 --> 00:32:03,943
You don't have to
say another word.

728
00:32:04,856 --> 00:32:07,257
That must've been awful.

729
00:32:07,326 --> 00:32:09,337
Those cheap hotel
rooms are horrible.

730
00:32:09,361 --> 00:32:13,096
You must've felt terrible
and lonely and embarrassed

731
00:32:13,165 --> 00:32:15,410
and I just made it
worse by bugging you

732
00:32:15,434 --> 00:32:17,914
and asking you questions
when I should've just...

733
00:32:19,154 --> 00:32:22,956
I totally understand
why you didn't tell me.

734
00:32:23,025 --> 00:32:25,336
If that happened to me, I
wouldn't have told anybody, either.

735
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,826
I'm sorry.

736
00:32:26,895 --> 00:32:30,730
I'm so sorry, but
thank you for telling me.

737
00:32:31,533 --> 00:32:33,049
Thank you for understanding.

738
00:32:44,112 --> 00:32:46,713
Benjamin Warren, I'm
so disappointed in you.

739
00:32:46,782 --> 00:32:48,048
She's your family.

740
00:32:48,117 --> 00:32:49,883
I get it, okay?

741
00:32:49,952 --> 00:32:52,753
You're so evolved, so
tolerant and quick to adjust.

742
00:32:52,821 --> 00:32:54,671
And I'm just a dumb caveman.

743
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:55,766
Well, you don't have to be.

744
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:57,941
Twenty-five years, Miranda.

745
00:32:58,927 --> 00:33:00,026
I counted them up today.

746
00:33:00,094 --> 00:33:01,739
That's how long we
either shared a bedroom

747
00:33:01,763 --> 00:33:04,698
or an apartment or a
damn tent in the woods.

748
00:33:04,767 --> 00:33:07,467
It's a long time for this not
to come up, don't you think?

749
00:33:07,535 --> 00:33:09,252
She wasn't ready.

750
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:11,921
If this was anyone else, there
wouldn't even be an issue,

751
00:33:11,973 --> 00:33:15,442
but I told him everything.

752
00:33:15,511 --> 00:33:18,945
I mean, from my first crush,
Kahlia Hogg, fourth grade,

753
00:33:19,014 --> 00:33:22,732
to the night I proposed to
the gorgeous Miranda Bailey.

754
00:33:22,784 --> 00:33:24,317
And everything in between.

755
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:29,406
I had to tell Curt.

756
00:33:29,475 --> 00:33:31,408
First thing, always.

757
00:33:31,477 --> 00:33:34,577
But now he's got the
biggest thing in his life

758
00:33:34,646 --> 00:33:38,382
and he waited 25
years to tell me.

759
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:40,650
How's that supposed
to make me feel?

760
00:33:40,719 --> 00:33:43,487
Well, this isn't about you, Ben.

761
00:33:43,555 --> 00:33:47,023
It's her song. So, get off
the stage, let her sing it.

762
00:33:47,092 --> 00:33:49,893
No, could you please
just stop with that?

763
00:33:52,881 --> 00:33:55,882
I feel like it was
all a lie, you know?

764
00:33:58,187 --> 00:33:59,652
Our whole life...

765
00:34:01,123 --> 00:34:02,655
He lied to me.

766
00:34:03,892 --> 00:34:07,294
Well, Curt needs your help now.

767
00:34:07,362 --> 00:34:10,630
Yeah, well, it's
a little late to ask.

768
00:34:10,699 --> 00:34:13,116
Should've asked 25 years ago.

769
00:34:13,184 --> 00:34:15,452
I'm done with him.

770
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:19,239
Her.

771
00:34:34,039 --> 00:34:35,471
Curt.

772
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:38,842
Um, this is Dr. Avery.
He's a plastic surgeon.

773
00:34:41,512 --> 00:34:43,752
Um... You might
want to hear him out.

774
00:34:43,815 --> 00:34:45,982
It's your call.

775
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:50,286
You have a name yet?

776
00:34:50,355 --> 00:34:52,755
Guessing you're not
sticking with Curtis.

777
00:34:54,927 --> 00:34:57,060
Rosalind.

778
00:34:57,128 --> 00:34:59,395
That's a beautiful name.

779
00:34:59,465 --> 00:35:00,964
So, can I call you
Rosalind then?

780
00:35:01,032 --> 00:35:03,352
'Cause I don't know
what we're waiting for.

781
00:35:07,038 --> 00:35:09,773
Hey, I'm Jackson.

782
00:35:12,243 --> 00:35:14,794
Now, let's go over
some ground rules.

783
00:35:14,863 --> 00:35:17,830
First, those off-shelf hormone
treatments you're taking,

784
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:20,066
no, those are over.

785
00:35:20,135 --> 00:35:22,313
From now on, everything
that goes in your body

786
00:35:22,337 --> 00:35:25,138
is approved and
regulated by this hospital.

787
00:35:25,207 --> 00:35:26,367
Understood?

788
00:35:27,175 --> 00:35:29,158
Absolutely.

789
00:35:29,227 --> 00:35:31,928
Okay. You see a therapist?

790
00:35:31,996 --> 00:35:33,430
Not for a while.

791
00:35:33,498 --> 00:35:36,265
Okay. Well, it's
time to start again.

792
00:35:36,335 --> 00:35:39,703
So, we'll get started
with a full medical history.

793
00:35:39,771 --> 00:35:41,538
You know, I used to be fun.

794
00:35:41,607 --> 00:35:44,407
I used to skate around
the halls of this hospital.

795
00:35:44,476 --> 00:35:46,242
Why don't you?

796
00:35:46,311 --> 00:35:49,178
Oops. My bad.

797
00:35:49,247 --> 00:35:51,481
I used to go dancing.

798
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:55,986
I used to flirt and
be flirted with.

799
00:35:56,054 --> 00:35:59,322
Now I live in a house
full of naked people

800
00:35:59,391 --> 00:36:01,725
and all of my friends
are her friends,

801
00:36:01,793 --> 00:36:04,194
and all I have is work and
I never want to go home.

802
00:36:04,262 --> 00:36:07,830
Mmm. I had a busy, busy life.

803
00:36:07,899 --> 00:36:09,666
I sat on all these boards,

804
00:36:09,734 --> 00:36:12,068
Pacific Ballet, Seattle Opera.

805
00:36:12,136 --> 00:36:16,573
Whatever was very
important to my ex.

806
00:36:16,641 --> 00:36:19,576
I used to be so worried
about what he thought of me,

807
00:36:19,644 --> 00:36:22,712
what my peers thought,
what everybody thought.

808
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:27,433
But now I do what I want,
when I want, and it's sweet.

809
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:28,929
I have to tell you, Robbins,

810
00:36:28,953 --> 00:36:32,739
my life is so much better
now that I have nothing.

811
00:36:32,808 --> 00:36:35,541
I mean, I can't
recommend a tumor,

812
00:36:35,611 --> 00:36:37,727
but you should try it.

813
00:36:41,283 --> 00:36:43,015
You should go home.

814
00:36:43,501 --> 00:36:44,701
I am home.

815
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:46,447
Why do you think
I stole this couch?

816
00:36:46,471 --> 00:36:47,549
We can't waste a minute.

817
00:36:47,573 --> 00:36:51,441
I'm gonna stay here until...

818
00:36:51,509 --> 00:36:53,409
Until it's over.

819
00:36:53,478 --> 00:36:54,878
Whatever that means.

820
00:36:58,733 --> 00:37:00,650
Then I'll stay with you tonight.

821
00:37:03,171 --> 00:37:04,770
You should know

822
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,960
I'm not gonna have sex with you.

823
00:37:07,142 --> 00:37:08,608
Shut up!

824
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:20,069
Uh, hi.

825
00:37:20,138 --> 00:37:21,888
Hey. Sorry.

826
00:37:21,957 --> 00:37:23,139
Do you drink wine?

827
00:37:23,759 --> 00:37:25,125
Uh...

828
00:37:25,193 --> 00:37:26,842
I just wanted to visit,

829
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:29,745
and people bring wine
sometimes when they're

830
00:37:29,814 --> 00:37:31,694
going to visit another person.

831
00:37:32,701 --> 00:37:34,634
Especially if they have...

832
00:37:36,138 --> 00:37:37,520
They bring a bottle.

833
00:37:37,572 --> 00:37:40,289
That's water.

834
00:37:40,358 --> 00:37:41,598
So...

835
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:42,770
Because I don't drink wine.

836
00:37:42,794 --> 00:37:45,845
I don't drink at
all. Not anymore.

837
00:37:45,914 --> 00:37:50,216
So, I brought water, and...

838
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:54,354
I'm sorry.

839
00:37:54,422 --> 00:37:55,988
I have literally no game.

840
00:38:03,532 --> 00:38:06,199
I should go. It's sparkling.

841
00:38:06,285 --> 00:38:08,618
Mm-hmm. Lime.

842
00:38:08,687 --> 00:38:10,587
Just wanted to say hi.

843
00:38:12,924 --> 00:38:15,625
Hey, do you want some water?

844
00:38:15,694 --> 00:38:17,010
Not thirsty.

845
00:38:18,196 --> 00:38:19,562
Okay, wait.

846
00:38:19,631 --> 00:38:20,813
Amelia.

847
00:38:20,882 --> 00:38:22,715
Stop walking.

848
00:38:27,122 --> 00:38:31,724
I'm gonna kiss you now,
so don't say anything.

849
00:38:50,545 --> 00:38:53,245
<i>It's scary to reveal
everything about ourselves.</i>

850
00:38:54,215 --> 00:38:56,282
And now you can go home.

851
00:38:56,350 --> 00:38:58,585
I'm gonna go home.

852
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:07,593
Which is that way. To my house.

853
00:39:31,102 --> 00:39:33,370
<i>Fear makes us
hold ourselves back.</i>

854
00:39:34,873 --> 00:39:36,272
<i>Is that so wrong?</i>

855
00:39:36,341 --> 00:39:37,341
Here you go.

856
00:39:37,409 --> 00:39:39,392
Okay, this is taking too long.

857
00:39:41,195 --> 00:39:42,275
Dance with me.

858
00:39:42,697 --> 00:39:44,047
Okay.

859
00:39:44,115 --> 00:39:45,415
Okay.

860
00:39:50,455 --> 00:39:52,621
<i>Maybe. Probably.</i>

861
00:39:58,829 --> 00:40:00,696
<i>But still</i>

862
00:40:00,765 --> 00:40:02,685
<i>it helps to be a little sneaky,</i>

863
00:40:03,368 --> 00:40:05,385
<i>a little protective.</i>

864
00:40:10,892 --> 00:40:14,694
<i>It's not safe to just blurt
out all of our secrets.</i>

865
00:40:14,762 --> 00:40:18,130
Never got on the plane.
I never went to DC.

866
00:40:18,199 --> 00:40:19,932
Now you want to blab.

867
00:40:20,001 --> 00:40:21,868
Where's Pierce?

868
00:40:21,936 --> 00:40:24,253
What is she? Morning
shift? I get nights?

869
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:26,672
I went to a hotel.

870
00:40:26,741 --> 00:40:29,759
What? With who? Do I know him?

871
00:40:29,828 --> 00:40:31,227
No. By myself.

872
00:40:31,296 --> 00:40:33,029
What, you didn't
want to see Derek?

873
00:40:33,098 --> 00:40:36,632
I did. Too much.

874
00:40:36,701 --> 00:40:39,061
What if I got off the plane and
he wasn't happy to see me?

875
00:40:41,422 --> 00:40:43,288
What if he didn't smile?

876
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:44,657
That would be bad.

877
00:40:44,726 --> 00:40:46,726
That would mean
it's done, it's over.

878
00:40:48,463 --> 00:40:52,031
So, what? You
just head out alone?

879
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:53,744
I mean, why didn't
you just come back?

880
00:40:53,768 --> 00:40:55,868
I was going to.

881
00:40:55,937 --> 00:40:59,105
And then, I didn't.

882
00:41:02,844 --> 00:41:04,084
<i>And it was amazing.</i>

883
00:41:07,031 --> 00:41:10,232
<i>It was just me for three days.</i>

884
00:41:12,169 --> 00:41:14,303
<i>All by myself.</i>

885
00:41:14,372 --> 00:41:17,773
<i>I wasn't anybody's
wife or doctor or mother.</i>

886
00:41:19,911 --> 00:41:21,143
<i>And I kind of liked it.</i>

887
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:28,734
If I had gone to DC,
we would've fought

888
00:41:28,803 --> 00:41:30,803
or we would've
talked about fighting.

889
00:41:30,871 --> 00:41:32,216
And I don't want
to talk anymore.

890
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,440
I don't want to fight anymore.

891
00:41:35,143 --> 00:41:37,410
Alex.

892
00:41:39,647 --> 00:41:41,580
I don't want to leave him.

893
00:41:43,318 --> 00:41:47,119
But I definitely do not want
to be with him right now.

894
00:41:47,205 --> 00:41:49,672
<i>We can't just lay all
the truth out there,</i>

895
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:52,808
<i>expose ourselves to
God and everybody.</i>

896
00:41:52,877 --> 00:41:54,994
Hey, have you seen my... Oh!

897
00:41:56,397 --> 00:41:59,816
Oh! A little warning when
people are over would be nice.

898
00:41:59,885 --> 00:42:01,533
I told her to wear pants.

899
00:42:01,603 --> 00:42:02,843
I don't have to wear pants.

900
00:42:02,904 --> 00:42:05,938
It's perfectly fine if
I don't wear pants.

901
00:42:06,007 --> 00:42:07,201
Doesn't make me stupid.

902
00:42:07,225 --> 00:42:09,242
<i>'Cause once the truth is out...</i>

903
00:42:09,311 --> 00:42:10,576
I'm gonna marry that girl.

904
00:42:10,645 --> 00:42:11,885
<i>We have to face it ourselves.</i>

905
00:42:15,283 --> 00:42:18,051
I don't know what's
gonna happen with us.
