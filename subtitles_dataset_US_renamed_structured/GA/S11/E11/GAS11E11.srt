1
00:00:08,742 --> 00:00:12,111
<i>There's a thing we say
when someone dies.</i>

2
00:00:16,967 --> 00:00:19,467
<i>We say it to the
patient's family.</i>

3
00:00:25,208 --> 00:00:27,175
There are on-call
rooms for that.

4
00:00:32,683 --> 00:00:35,350
<i>We say, "I'm
sorry for your loss."</i>

5
00:00:35,418 --> 00:00:38,386
With type II, we're dealing
with low birth weight,

6
00:00:38,456 --> 00:00:41,122
underdeveloped lungs,
swallowing problems,

7
00:00:41,191 --> 00:00:42,674
respiratory problems.

8
00:00:42,743 --> 00:00:45,611
If carried to term, type
II infants typically die

9
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:48,363
within a few hours of
delivery, sometimes days.

10
00:00:48,432 --> 00:00:52,617
Your baby's also at high
risk for intrauterine fracturing.

11
00:00:52,686 --> 00:00:54,919
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Um...

12
00:00:54,988 --> 00:00:56,015
Did you say intrauterine?

13
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:57,956
Yes.

14
00:00:58,024 --> 00:01:01,624
My baby's bones are
breaking inside of my belly?

15
00:01:02,946 --> 00:01:06,364
The place he's supposed to
be safe, his bones are breaking.

16
00:01:06,434 --> 00:01:07,749
No, I just...

17
00:01:07,818 --> 00:01:11,987
Um, can he feel it?
His bones breaking?

18
00:01:12,056 --> 00:01:13,689
I mean, he can feel it, right?

19
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:18,593
So, he's in... He's in pain.

20
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:22,430
Again, I am so sorry.

21
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:25,934
<i>It's a pat little phrase,
and an empty one.</i>

22
00:01:31,541 --> 00:01:34,943
<i>It doesn't begin to cover what's
actually happening to them.</i>

23
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:36,278
Clear.

24
00:01:38,415 --> 00:01:40,882
<i>It lets us empathize
without forcing us</i>

25
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:43,351
<i>to feel their
devastation ourselves.</i>

26
00:01:46,723 --> 00:01:47,822
<i>It protects us...</i>

27
00:01:47,891 --> 00:01:49,324
Time of death...

28
00:01:50,945 --> 00:01:53,578
<i>from feeling that pain.</i>

29
00:01:53,647 --> 00:01:57,582
<i>That dark, sinking,
relentless pain,</i>

30
00:01:57,651 --> 00:02:01,236
<i>the kind that can eat you alive.</i>

31
00:02:01,304 --> 00:02:04,239
<i>And every day, I
thank God for that.</i>

32
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:23,275
I thought they went home.

33
00:02:23,344 --> 00:02:24,809
They wanted to talk some more.

34
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:26,856
I'm not sure it helped.
Why didn't you call me?

35
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,746
I mean, I can help them.

36
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:29,747
They need someone who knows
them and who cares about them

37
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:30,994
and who can make it...

38
00:02:31,018 --> 00:02:32,117
Who can make it what?

39
00:02:32,186 --> 00:02:34,119
Nice.

40
00:02:34,188 --> 00:02:36,521
I want to make it as
nice for them as it can be.

41
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:37,830
And you're not nice.

42
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:39,557
You really care
about them, don't you?

43
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:41,237
Yeah, I do. They're my friends.

44
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:44,512
And that right there is why you
have no business in that room.

45
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:46,547
There's only one set of feelings

46
00:02:46,617 --> 00:02:48,516
that matters here,
and it's not yours.

47
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:51,552
I don't know what's gonna
help them, but it isn't you.

48
00:02:51,622 --> 00:02:54,957
April Kepner is no longer
your patient. Excuse me.

49
00:03:14,178 --> 00:03:15,510
There's no way,

50
00:03:15,579 --> 00:03:17,223
no way for me to do
what I need to do...

51
00:03:17,247 --> 00:03:18,780
April.

52
00:03:18,849 --> 00:03:21,900
And what I believe
that I should do.

53
00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:23,452
Shh, shh, shh.

54
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,971
There is a way, sweetheart.
There's always a way.

55
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:28,890
Now, here's what we'll do.

56
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:33,561
You will choose a day. Soon.

57
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,831
Set it aside and
arrange to be induced.

58
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:40,402
And you'll give birth to
your beautiful little boy.

59
00:03:40,471 --> 00:03:42,871
And you'll give him a name

60
00:03:42,939 --> 00:03:45,557
and have him baptized
right then and there.

61
00:03:45,626 --> 00:03:49,695
Then you're gonna
get to hold that baby.

62
00:03:49,763 --> 00:03:52,831
And you'll pray for
him and sing to him.

63
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,200
You're gonna look at him.

64
00:03:55,269 --> 00:03:57,568
You're gonna look at him

65
00:03:57,637 --> 00:04:01,339
and memorize every
little detail of his face.

66
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:06,662
And you will do that
as long as he lives.

67
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:11,016
You will do that
until God takes him.

68
00:04:11,085 --> 00:04:12,517
That's how you will do this.

69
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:17,706
We can do that.

70
00:04:17,774 --> 00:04:19,090
Can you do that for me?

71
00:04:19,159 --> 00:04:21,910
Of course I'll do that for you.

72
00:04:21,979 --> 00:04:24,379
I'll do that for you
and him and us.

73
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:25,580
Okay. Okay?

74
00:04:25,649 --> 00:04:26,764
Okay.

75
00:04:27,384 --> 00:04:29,784
So, I'll just...

76
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:33,521
I'll just hold him
until God takes him.

77
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:35,206
That sounds lovely.

78
00:04:37,144 --> 00:04:39,127
Maybe God won't take him.

79
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:44,199
Maybe there will be a miracle.

80
00:04:44,268 --> 00:04:46,334
Okay.

81
00:04:47,404 --> 00:04:49,504
I'll just pray for a miracle.

82
00:04:49,573 --> 00:04:51,306
Okay. Okay.

83
00:04:54,144 --> 00:04:57,662
Okay. Okay.

84
00:05:11,277 --> 00:05:13,122
Lord... Bailey!

85
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,079
Grey! What?

86
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,349
Sorry. I have a favor to ask.

87
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:19,634
I'm on call this
weekend. Can you take it?

88
00:05:19,702 --> 00:05:20,862
Why? What do you need to do?

89
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:22,203
I want to go see Derek.

90
00:05:22,272 --> 00:05:23,399
I don't really want to
talk about it in here.

91
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:24,705
No, I can't.

92
00:05:24,774 --> 00:05:26,152
Little Tuck is with his father,

93
00:05:26,176 --> 00:05:27,976
and Ben and I have the
weekend to ourselves.

94
00:05:28,045 --> 00:05:29,572
Which is exactly why I'm asking.

95
00:05:29,596 --> 00:05:31,913
Then you know exactly
why I'm saying no.

96
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:33,199
Huh!

97
00:05:37,137 --> 00:05:38,303
Lord...

98
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:43,675
Oh, well, crap.

99
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:47,061
You know what I was gonna say.

100
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,700
Somebody get me an OR, please?

101
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:55,904
Move beds three and
four to the burn center.

102
00:05:55,972 --> 00:05:57,012
Coming through!

103
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,606
It's a mess in here.

104
00:05:58,675 --> 00:06:00,670
Yeah, Kepner's out. Things
don't run right without her.

105
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:02,688
We have a GSW in five.
Bailey, can you take that?

106
00:06:02,712 --> 00:06:04,541
Yeah, but how are
they? Kepner and Avery?

107
00:06:04,565 --> 00:06:05,685
No word.

108
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:06,843
I'm admitting that
femur break in bed six.

109
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:08,077
Bed five needs a RT consult.

110
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:09,245
Okay, hold on. Hold on. Uh...

111
00:06:09,269 --> 00:06:10,930
Okay, where's Kepner?
I can just tell her.

112
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:12,837
Uh, she and Avery are out today.

113
00:06:12,906 --> 00:06:14,672
Oh, God, today?

114
00:06:14,742 --> 00:06:17,042
Okay, what are we
gonna do for them?

115
00:06:17,111 --> 00:06:18,560
Flowers? No, that's weird.

116
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:20,306
Yeah, no, what else
can we do for them?

117
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:21,941
Do for who? BOTH:
Kepner and Avery.

118
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:23,915
Oh, God, what do
you do? Flowers?

119
00:06:23,984 --> 00:06:25,127
Vetoed. Food?

120
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:26,651
Who cooks?

121
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,198
Nobody cooks. Oh, Kepner cooks.

122
00:06:28,222 --> 00:06:29,616
We could do a fruit basket?

123
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,688
Oh, stop.

124
00:06:30,758 --> 00:06:31,784
We could all sign a card.

125
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:33,608
Okay, I'm stopping.

126
00:06:33,677 --> 00:06:35,426
I lit a candle in the chapel.

127
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:36,828
It made me feel better.

128
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,580
You can all just, um,
give them privacy.

129
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:41,382
That's all they're gonna want.

130
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:46,404
Uh, Shepherd.

131
00:06:46,473 --> 00:06:49,207
Uh, you said you wanted to go
over Dr. Herman's tumor plan.

132
00:06:49,276 --> 00:06:50,276
You want to get lunch?

133
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:51,327
Oh, uh...

134
00:06:52,129 --> 00:06:54,963
I can't. I got to push it.

135
00:07:01,571 --> 00:07:02,715
Drew Hawkins,

136
00:07:02,739 --> 00:07:05,640
in for a surgical resection
of a butterfly glioma.

137
00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:08,309
Can you see the
light even a little?

138
00:07:08,378 --> 00:07:10,945
Nope. It's just black.

139
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:13,548
Total blindness now
for about a month.

140
00:07:14,284 --> 00:07:16,084
But I can still smell.

141
00:07:16,153 --> 00:07:18,453
What is that, lilac perfume?

142
00:07:19,122 --> 00:07:20,821
Lavender shampoo.

143
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:22,857
And why has Drew gone blind?

144
00:07:22,926 --> 00:07:24,092
The blindness in both eyes

145
00:07:24,161 --> 00:07:25,822
is caused by a lesion
in the optic radiation.

146
00:07:25,846 --> 00:07:27,912
Nailed it, Dr. Lavender.

147
00:07:27,981 --> 00:07:29,142
Oh, can we show her the trick?

148
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:30,198
Sure.

149
00:07:32,269 --> 00:07:34,235
Catch! Oh, wow!

150
00:07:34,321 --> 00:07:35,748
Pretty fly for a
blind guy, right?

151
00:07:35,772 --> 00:07:36,838
How?

152
00:07:36,906 --> 00:07:38,000
Drew has cortical blindness.

153
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:39,641
His eyes still see,

154
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,221
but only the subconscious part
of his brain receives the signals.

155
00:07:41,245 --> 00:07:43,678
Your subconscious saw the pen.

156
00:07:43,747 --> 00:07:45,113
Once I decompress the tumor,

157
00:07:45,181 --> 00:07:46,759
I may be able to free
up the visual cortex,

158
00:07:46,783 --> 00:07:48,033
possibly restoring your sight.

159
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:49,901
And maybe I'll see again?

160
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,210
Drew, we talked about this.

161
00:07:51,254 --> 00:07:52,782
I am gonna try
for total resection,

162
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:54,917
but at the very least,
I will buy you time.

163
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:56,836
I know, I know, but
there's a chance?

164
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,626
There's a chance.

165
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:04,543
What do you have for me?

166
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:06,946
Brenda Bonaman, 44. Isolated
shotgun wound to the neck.

167
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:09,498
She has right shoulder dislocation
status post mechanical fall.

168
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:11,082
Who shot her? My husband.

169
00:08:11,141 --> 00:08:12,456
Your husband?

170
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:13,765
Not like that! Not on purpose!

171
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,092
It was an accident.

172
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:16,439
Was it, Howard?
Was it an accident?

173
00:08:16,463 --> 00:08:18,430
Did you confuse me with a moose?

174
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,192
Brenda, if I wanted to shoot
you, I'd have done it in the woods,

175
00:08:20,216 --> 00:08:22,178
you'd still be out there.
Okay, let's calm it down.

176
00:08:22,202 --> 00:08:23,646
Let's get her to trauma one now.

177
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,587
Shoulder dislocation.

178
00:08:25,655 --> 00:08:27,121
The acromion's fractured.

179
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:28,818
I'm gonna need to do a
reduction under anesthesia.

180
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:31,343
Might as well wait. She's
got a zone two injury.

181
00:08:31,411 --> 00:08:33,139
Wounds from the
cricoid to the mandible.

182
00:08:33,163 --> 00:08:34,491
She's got to go
straight to the OR.

183
00:08:34,515 --> 00:08:36,114
Oh, God. Brenda, I'm sorry.

184
00:08:36,183 --> 00:08:37,716
Howard, shut up.

185
00:08:37,784 --> 00:08:40,234
And, uh, why were we pointing
a shotgun at our wife today?

186
00:08:40,303 --> 00:08:41,498
I was putting it away, and...

187
00:08:41,522 --> 00:08:43,265
We had just come
back from duck hunting.

188
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:45,334
Duck hunting, his big
idea of an adventure.

189
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:46,552
It was fun! You had...

190
00:08:46,576 --> 00:08:47,753
I wanted to go to Belize.

191
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:49,210
Well, it rains in Belize, too.

192
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,029
I don't get shot in Belize!

193
00:08:52,315 --> 00:08:54,010
Brenda, what's hurting?
Everything hurts!

194
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:56,117
Doctor, here's the x-ray. Okay.

195
00:08:56,186 --> 00:08:58,648
Okay, yeah, it's this pellet. It's
close to the major blood vessels.

196
00:08:58,672 --> 00:09:00,015
And we'll know for sure

197
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,217
once we open her
up. Come on, let's go.

198
00:09:01,241 --> 00:09:02,590
Oh, God! Howard.

199
00:09:02,659 --> 00:09:04,458
Baby. Brenda, honey,
I'm here. I'm sorry.

200
00:09:04,527 --> 00:09:06,055
All right, we got to go. Sir,
could you move, please?

201
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:07,106
Warren, follow up on her labs.

202
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:08,224
And have them rushed quick.

203
00:09:08,248 --> 00:09:09,680
I need them upstairs.

204
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,983
Is she... What is
happening to her?

205
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:14,130
Listen, you can wait
right over there, okay?

206
00:09:14,154 --> 00:09:17,055
And listen, as soon as we know
something, we'll come get you.

207
00:09:17,124 --> 00:09:19,390
We are gonna take
very good care of her.

208
00:09:19,459 --> 00:09:20,892
All right.

209
00:09:20,961 --> 00:09:22,627
Um, what do I do with this?

210
00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:24,140
Uh, that's a patient's
personals release.

211
00:09:24,164 --> 00:09:25,564
But, uh, you
take it to the clerk.

212
00:09:25,599 --> 00:09:27,131
But first, take
these up to the lab.

213
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,166
Tell them to rush
the results. You got it?

214
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:39,410
What time did you
come to bed last night?

215
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:41,713
I didn't until this morning.

216
00:09:43,015 --> 00:09:45,316
Ugh. My palms are so sweaty.

217
00:09:46,653 --> 00:09:47,736
Hi.

218
00:09:47,821 --> 00:09:52,874
So, I just need a few
signatures before we begin.

219
00:09:52,943 --> 00:09:57,395
Um, so, what exactly
happens after this?

220
00:09:57,464 --> 00:09:59,230
How do we get started?

221
00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:02,216
Well, uh, after we're done
here, I will take you to your room.

222
00:10:02,302 --> 00:10:04,803
I'll give you the medication
that starts dilation,

223
00:10:04,871 --> 00:10:06,521
then the Pitocin.

224
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:09,708
And your body will know
what to do from there.

225
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:13,394
So, this is for the
birth certificate.

226
00:10:13,463 --> 00:10:14,946
Have you decided on a name?

227
00:10:15,015 --> 00:10:16,075
Uh, we are still
working on that.

228
00:10:16,099 --> 00:10:17,431
We're... Yeah.

229
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,340
Okay, you can just sign now
and we'll fill in the rest later.

230
00:10:21,304 --> 00:10:23,405
Uh, these are the consent forms.

231
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:25,317
I think we signed
those. Not these.

232
00:10:25,341 --> 00:10:28,843
Uh, what we're doing today
is an induction termination.

233
00:10:28,912 --> 00:10:31,279
You're at 24 weeks,
so, technically,

234
00:10:31,348 --> 00:10:34,932
we could intervene to keep
the baby alive after the delivery.

235
00:10:35,002 --> 00:10:39,320
And these are just forms to
make it official that you don't.

236
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:46,301
I need both signatures.

237
00:10:46,362 --> 00:10:47,795
What are those other forms?

238
00:10:48,831 --> 00:10:49,898
Uh...

239
00:10:49,966 --> 00:10:53,551
These are, um, for
the death certificate.

240
00:10:53,619 --> 00:10:55,020
Really?

241
00:10:55,088 --> 00:10:56,921
Can we not yet?

242
00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:00,475
It's better to get all of the
paperwork out of the way,

243
00:11:00,543 --> 00:11:03,823
and then you never have
to worry about it again.

244
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:06,898
Do you need a
minute? Yes, please.

245
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:16,908
All I wanted was to
start a family with you.

246
00:11:16,977 --> 00:11:19,677
Oh, I know. I know.

247
00:11:19,746 --> 00:11:21,579
This isn't fair.

248
00:11:21,648 --> 00:11:23,648
None of this is fair.

249
00:11:23,717 --> 00:11:25,649
You're right. I know.

250
00:11:34,311 --> 00:11:36,810
I don't care what she
says. I'm not signing these.

251
00:11:46,073 --> 00:11:47,784
I didn't even know
this place was here.

252
00:11:47,808 --> 00:11:49,074
Shh.

253
00:11:52,412 --> 00:11:53,845
Okay, let's go.

254
00:11:53,914 --> 00:11:55,246
Shh.

255
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:04,238
I found it first. Their
baby's problem.

256
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:05,807
I know, but that isn't...

257
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:08,252
I wished horrible
things for them, Jo.

258
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:10,695
Jackson left me for her,

259
00:12:10,764 --> 00:12:14,331
and I wished them misery
and fights and breakups.

260
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:16,945
I mean, I'd see them sitting
together in the cafeteria,

261
00:12:16,969 --> 00:12:19,129
and I'd wish them
food poisoning.

262
00:12:19,873 --> 00:12:20,949
Then I found this.

263
00:12:20,973 --> 00:12:23,408
You would never
have wished them this.

264
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:24,954
You know that.

265
00:12:24,978 --> 00:12:27,259
If you hadn't have found it,
somebody else would have.

266
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:29,781
It wouldn't have
changed anything.

267
00:12:29,849 --> 00:12:31,115
It's not on you.

268
00:12:31,183 --> 00:12:34,068
If anything, it just means
that you're a good doctor.

269
00:12:37,207 --> 00:12:38,523
Okay.

270
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:42,366
I'm gonna go make
a blind man see.

271
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:53,883
Zola's gonna push
for cookies after dinner.

272
00:12:53,907 --> 00:12:55,173
Don't fall for it.

273
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:56,718
And Bailey's blanket
is in the dryer.

274
00:12:56,742 --> 00:12:58,053
Yeah, why don't
you tell this to Jo?

275
00:12:58,077 --> 00:12:59,538
She's gonna be doing it. What?

276
00:12:59,562 --> 00:13:01,507
You offered. I
didn't offer. Jo did.

277
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:03,409
I'm on call all weekend.
What's going on?

278
00:13:03,433 --> 00:13:06,129
I can't leave my kids with
Wilson. Wilson is a hoodlum.

279
00:13:06,153 --> 00:13:07,696
I leave my kids with my person.

280
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,298
Cristina did it all the time.

281
00:13:09,322 --> 00:13:10,966
Cristina Yang
watched your kids? Yes.

282
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,585
I don't buy that for a second.

283
00:13:12,609 --> 00:13:13,609
Talk to Jo.

284
00:13:13,677 --> 00:13:14,717
No Jo!

285
00:13:16,446 --> 00:13:17,845
She asked you to watch her kids?

286
00:13:17,913 --> 00:13:21,416
Yeah, she's wigging out about
trying to go to DC to see Derek.

287
00:13:21,484 --> 00:13:23,484
Why didn't she ask
me? I'm a person.

288
00:13:23,553 --> 00:13:25,313
That's not what she meant. What?

289
00:13:25,338 --> 00:13:26,882
And you don't
want to be, trust me.

290
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:28,322
It's a pain in the ass.

291
00:13:32,345 --> 00:13:33,689
All right, let's
get her prepped.

292
00:13:33,713 --> 00:13:34,812
We need to put her under.

293
00:13:34,881 --> 00:13:36,180
It hurts. It hurts!

294
00:13:36,249 --> 00:13:37,693
Okay, we know, but we're
gonna put you to sleep,

295
00:13:37,717 --> 00:13:38,994
and then we can
attend to that shoulder.

296
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:40,951
No, no, my stomach!

297
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,466
Uh, hold the anesthesia. She's
complaining of abdominal pain.

298
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:44,700
I'm here. Where do you need me?

299
00:13:44,724 --> 00:13:46,924
Uh, can you bring
the ultrasound?

300
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:51,512
All right, I don't see any wounds
in her torso or her legs or...

301
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,643
Uh, Bailey? I don't think
you'll need that ultrasound.

302
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:56,879
Come here and tell me if I am
seeing what I think I'm seeing.

303
00:13:56,903 --> 00:13:58,213
Oh, my goodness.
Oh, my goodness.

304
00:13:58,237 --> 00:13:59,477
What? What's going on?

305
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:01,216
Uh, let's page OB! - Okay, okay.

306
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,657
Brenda, how far along are you?

307
00:14:02,726 --> 00:14:04,091
What? I don't know...

308
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,655
Why didn't you tell us
that you were pregnant?

309
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:07,240
Because I'm not!
That's impossible.

310
00:14:07,264 --> 00:14:08,407
Tell them to get here fast!

311
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:09,363
Yes, Doctor. Bring
me the stirrups.

312
00:14:09,432 --> 00:14:10,632
No, I'm not pregnant!

313
00:14:10,717 --> 00:14:13,284
I can't get pregnant!
I can't have a baby!

314
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:14,636
You are having one.

315
00:14:14,721 --> 00:14:16,531
I'm looking at its
head right now.

316
00:14:18,975 --> 00:14:20,186
Anderson?

317
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:21,353
That's a last name
as a first name.

318
00:14:21,377 --> 00:14:23,644
I hate last names
as first names.

319
00:14:23,713 --> 00:14:25,357
I have a last name
as a first name.

320
00:14:25,381 --> 00:14:27,181
This is gonna be too big on me.

321
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,827
I should've brought
something from home.

322
00:14:28,851 --> 00:14:30,368
Come on. I still like...

323
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:31,870
No!

324
00:14:31,938 --> 00:14:33,137
I'm sorry.

325
00:14:33,189 --> 00:14:34,934
I know he's your favorite uncle,

326
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:36,657
but you can't name
a child Norbert.

327
00:14:36,743 --> 00:14:38,943
Norbert's the kid that gets
his lunch money stolen.

328
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:40,723
He's the kid that gets
punched on the playground.

329
00:14:40,747 --> 00:14:42,764
That's not gonna be our kid.

330
00:14:46,086 --> 00:14:47,534
All right, ready for...

331
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:53,908
I'll come back.

332
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:58,012
Okay. I think it's time
to put on the gown.

333
00:14:58,098 --> 00:15:00,564
No, it's not time. We
don't have a name yet.

334
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:02,700
We can't do this without a name.

335
00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:06,037
We may only have a couple
of minutes with our son once...

336
00:15:06,105 --> 00:15:08,384
I am not gonna spend that
time trying to figure out a name.

337
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:09,451
Can we just...

338
00:15:09,475 --> 00:15:10,552
Just give me a minute, okay?

339
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:11,776
Just wait.

340
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:15,513
I just, I want... I just
want to wait in case...

341
00:15:17,217 --> 00:15:18,549
In case what?

342
00:15:21,354 --> 00:15:23,254
It happens.

343
00:15:23,323 --> 00:15:25,957
Jackson, they happen, all right?

344
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:29,994
Miracles, they happen to people.

345
00:15:30,046 --> 00:15:32,279
There are documented
medical cases

346
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:34,515
that cannot be
explained by science.

347
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:38,035
What if this is one of those and
we're deciding to do this today,

348
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:39,119
when if we just...

349
00:15:40,823 --> 00:15:42,401
I don't even know why
I'm talking to you about this.

350
00:15:42,425 --> 00:15:43,524
I'm not doing this.

351
00:15:43,593 --> 00:15:45,242
I thought I could, but I can't.

352
00:15:45,312 --> 00:15:46,455
I won't. April.

353
00:15:46,479 --> 00:15:48,462
Where are you going?

354
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:51,349
Okay, call OB again!
Here, hold pressure.

355
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:52,967
Uh, get a baby warmer in here.

356
00:15:53,036 --> 00:15:55,102
Uh, gown us, please.

357
00:15:55,171 --> 00:15:56,782
How does someone
go through nine months

358
00:15:56,806 --> 00:15:58,217
and not even know
she's pregnant?

359
00:15:58,241 --> 00:16:00,424
It happens. How did we not know?

360
00:16:00,493 --> 00:16:02,220
What happened to
those damn lab results?

361
00:16:02,244 --> 00:16:04,006
I don't know! I gave them
to an intern, and I told her...

362
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:05,941
I gave them to
you, not to an intern.

363
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,999
So you damn well better find
out what happened to them. Now!

364
00:16:16,259 --> 00:16:18,125
Who the hell left this here?

365
00:16:18,194 --> 00:16:20,060
Uh, what do you need?

366
00:16:20,129 --> 00:16:22,625
This kind of crap would never
happen when Kepner's here.

367
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:23,998
I'll take it up there.

368
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:50,607
So, if OB doesn't get
here, um, who's catching?

369
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,388
Uh, you are. Oh, I was
gonna say you were.

370
00:16:52,412 --> 00:16:53,944
Uh, I fix bones.

371
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,533
You guys are wrong!
I'm not pregnant!

372
00:16:56,699 --> 00:16:58,432
Is that another contraction?

373
00:16:58,501 --> 00:17:00,184
No, my... Ow! My shoulder!

374
00:17:02,222 --> 00:17:03,587
Okay, more lidocaine.

375
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:06,457
Brenda, we can't put you
under until the baby's born.

376
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:07,853
All right, someone,
uh, call peds!

377
00:17:07,877 --> 00:17:09,427
I'm having a baby? I am?

378
00:17:09,496 --> 00:17:10,762
Yes, you are, Brenda.

379
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:11,996
I can't have babies.

380
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:14,948
I want to, but they
told me I can't ever.

381
00:17:15,035 --> 00:17:16,178
Well, they were wrong, sweetie.

382
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:17,646
You can and you
are, so get ready.

383
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:20,637
On the next contraction, I'm
gonna need you to push. Okay?

384
00:17:22,742 --> 00:17:23,819
Pulse ox is dropping.

385
00:17:23,843 --> 00:17:25,683
The hematoma's
compressing the trachea.

386
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:26,911
She's gonna lose her airway!

387
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:28,190
Oh, God, okay.

388
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:30,008
Okay, all right, we're
almost there, Brenda.

389
00:17:30,032 --> 00:17:31,810
I want you to push for me, okay?

390
00:17:31,834 --> 00:17:33,751
One, two, three, push!

391
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:35,697
That's great. That's great.

392
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:38,655
Okay, try it again.
One, two, three, push!

393
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,609
No! No, no, no. Don't push.

394
00:17:42,678 --> 00:17:44,924
She's straining too hard.
She's dislodged the clot.

395
00:17:44,948 --> 00:17:46,764
Uh, lap pads, lap pads.

396
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:48,232
Hold pressure with me here.

397
00:17:48,301 --> 00:17:50,317
Bailey. Bailey, it's okay.

398
00:17:50,386 --> 00:17:52,397
It's okay. You did
it, Brenda. You did it.

399
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:56,748
Brenda, you have a little girl.

400
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:10,860
Hey, you know how
this is done? Not a clue.

401
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:12,740
Hey, uh...

402
00:18:12,808 --> 00:18:14,208
Did Yang ever watch
Meredith's kids?

403
00:18:15,528 --> 00:18:17,361
See, I knew it.
Mer's full of crap.

404
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,391
I don't have to babysit
for her. No, no. She did.

405
00:18:19,415 --> 00:18:22,149
Cristina would take
Zola. She'd take her home.

406
00:18:22,218 --> 00:18:23,796
And then when
the diaper blew out,

407
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:27,421
she'd hold her up to me
like a bag of medical waste.

408
00:18:27,489 --> 00:18:30,535
Cristina would study.
She'd eat all of Zola's snacks.

409
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:32,104
And I would be the
one down on the floor,

410
00:18:32,128 --> 00:18:33,805
playing with blocks,
so yes and no.

411
00:18:33,829 --> 00:18:35,257
What are you doing this weekend?

412
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:37,681
I'd do it for Cristina,
I'm not doing it for you.

413
00:18:46,091 --> 00:18:47,241
Damn it.

414
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:56,845
So, his eyes still work, it's just
the communication to the brain?

415
00:18:56,869 --> 00:18:58,247
But his tumor's in
the corpus callosum,

416
00:18:58,271 --> 00:18:59,548
pushing into both
occipital lobes.

417
00:18:59,572 --> 00:19:01,283
Right. He'll probably
never see again.

418
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:02,307
But you said...

419
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:03,615
I said we'd try.

420
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:05,659
What's this? Taking
on new cases?

421
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:08,361
You told me you were going,
"All my tumor, all the time."

422
00:19:08,431 --> 00:19:09,841
Giving up on me?
On the contrary.

423
00:19:09,865 --> 00:19:11,899
I'm going to use a CO2 laser

424
00:19:11,967 --> 00:19:14,519
to peel a man's
glioma off layer by layer.

425
00:19:14,571 --> 00:19:16,916
It's the same technique I'll
be using on your optic nerve.

426
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:20,441
It's how I'll keep you from
going blind when I save you.

427
00:19:20,509 --> 00:19:22,755
Ah. And here, I thought I'd
won you over to the dark side.

428
00:19:22,779 --> 00:19:23,895
Never.

429
00:19:23,963 --> 00:19:25,630
Keep hope alive.

430
00:19:25,698 --> 00:19:27,964
So, we're practicing on him?

431
00:19:28,034 --> 00:19:29,599
On Drew for Herman?

432
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:31,113
Even though you don't
think he's gonna see again.

433
00:19:31,137 --> 00:19:32,970
That's one way to look at it.

434
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:36,307
Another way is we're giving him
time, more years to live. Let's go.

435
00:19:36,376 --> 00:19:38,693
Have radiology send
everything up to the OR.

436
00:19:40,663 --> 00:19:41,774
Okay, put her
out. Let's intubate!

437
00:19:41,798 --> 00:19:43,380
Wait, wait, can I hold her?

438
00:19:43,449 --> 00:19:45,244
I'm here! Glove me. We
need to help you breathe now.

439
00:19:45,268 --> 00:19:46,550
I just need to see her.

440
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:48,853
I need to hold
her. She's crying.

441
00:19:48,922 --> 00:19:50,562
Where's my baby?

442
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:52,056
No, oh, no.

443
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:54,085
I'm gonna take her
and do an exam.

444
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:55,454
She'll be here when
you wake up, okay?

445
00:19:55,478 --> 00:19:56,711
Let me hold my baby!

446
00:19:56,779 --> 00:19:58,713
Look, if we do, she
might lose you, honey.

447
00:19:58,781 --> 00:19:59,841
There's no time. Let us work.

448
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:00,865
Please...

449
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:02,817
I'm so sorry, Brenda.

450
00:20:04,653 --> 00:20:06,398
Oh, she's throwing
multifocal PVCs.

451
00:20:06,422 --> 00:20:07,655
What the hell!

452
00:20:07,724 --> 00:20:10,057
Uh, it's...

453
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:12,120
Uh, ultrasound! Here.
Let me have those films.

454
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:13,210
Okay.

455
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,250
Where are you?

456
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:21,814
Oh, damn it. Where is what?

457
00:20:21,838 --> 00:20:24,305
There was a pellet
at the vessels.

458
00:20:24,373 --> 00:20:26,757
It should be right
there, and it isn't.

459
00:20:26,826 --> 00:20:28,987
Which means it
moved into her heart.

460
00:20:30,112 --> 00:20:31,429
Runs of V-tach!

461
00:20:31,497 --> 00:20:32,679
Okay, uh, 75 of lido.

462
00:20:32,765 --> 00:20:34,765
Let's get a repeat chest film!

463
00:20:34,817 --> 00:20:36,516
Page cardio!

464
00:20:36,585 --> 00:20:39,002
Brenda, no more surprises!

465
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:40,815
It was a urine sample
and two blood draws.

466
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:42,684
I gave it to an intern,
and I told her to...

467
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:44,520
I found it sitting
on a supply rack.

468
00:20:44,544 --> 00:20:46,410
Which intern? I don't know.

469
00:20:46,479 --> 00:20:49,547
She was about this
tall, dark-haired?

470
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:51,560
Hey, Richard. When
you find her, find me.

471
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:54,024
No, when I find her,
I'm gonna kill her.

472
00:20:54,554 --> 00:20:56,165
Hi. So, I'm on
call this weekend,

473
00:20:56,189 --> 00:20:57,716
and I was wondering
if you could take it.

474
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:59,539
Oh, I'm sorry. I
might have plans.

475
00:20:59,626 --> 00:21:02,209
Catherine Avery's in town,
and she's going through hell.

476
00:21:02,277 --> 00:21:03,621
And I'd like to
be able to tell her

477
00:21:03,645 --> 00:21:05,557
I'll be available if she
needs me for anything.

478
00:21:05,581 --> 00:21:07,008
Never mind. I'll
find someone else.

479
00:21:07,032 --> 00:21:08,760
Is there a problem?
Uh, it's not a big deal.

480
00:21:08,784 --> 00:21:10,395
We can just drop
it. Everything okay?

481
00:21:10,419 --> 00:21:11,614
Yeah, it's fine. Really?

482
00:21:11,638 --> 00:21:12,820
You can tell me.

483
00:21:12,889 --> 00:21:14,049
I'd rather not.

484
00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:16,140
You said it was important.

485
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:18,542
It's just, mmm, sex.

486
00:21:18,594 --> 00:21:21,628
Emergency sex with my husband.

487
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:23,737
Should've dropped it. Told you.

488
00:21:26,736 --> 00:21:27,813
April.

489
00:21:27,837 --> 00:21:29,080
Let me go. Just wait.

490
00:21:29,104 --> 00:21:31,464
Okay, you're right
about miracles, okay?

491
00:21:31,507 --> 00:21:32,806
Sometimes they happen.

492
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:34,686
There are hearts that
start beating again.

493
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:37,723
There's cancer that just
goes away on its own.

494
00:21:37,747 --> 00:21:39,346
I know. I've seen it.

495
00:21:39,415 --> 00:21:41,999
It happens sometimes.

496
00:21:42,068 --> 00:21:45,652
But this, April,
this is not that.

497
00:21:46,989 --> 00:21:48,188
I know.

498
00:21:49,925 --> 00:21:52,359
This isn't fair.

499
00:21:54,063 --> 00:21:57,765
It isn't just.

500
00:21:57,833 --> 00:22:03,621
And I have spent my life
believing in a God who is just.

501
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:06,691
He gave me a calling,
and I followed it.

502
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:08,158
I save lives every day.

503
00:22:08,227 --> 00:22:10,260
I feel like I'm finally becoming

504
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:12,779
the person that
he wants me to be.

505
00:22:12,848 --> 00:22:16,116
And then this?
To be handed this?

506
00:22:18,955 --> 00:22:20,487
It's cruel.

507
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:24,324
I feel like God is
laughing at me.

508
00:22:25,795 --> 00:22:29,079
If this is a test, I fail.

509
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:36,303
All those years trusting
and believing and praying...

510
00:22:38,674 --> 00:22:42,342
And if this, if this were just,

511
00:22:42,411 --> 00:22:45,345
even a tiny bit,
then I could maybe...

512
00:22:49,584 --> 00:22:52,319
I can't. I have to
go back to work.

513
00:22:52,387 --> 00:22:54,605
I have to go to work.

514
00:23:02,198 --> 00:23:03,992
You're messing with me. I'm not.

515
00:23:04,016 --> 00:23:05,126
You are.

516
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:06,150
I'm not.

517
00:23:06,219 --> 00:23:07,785
That's your little girl.

518
00:23:07,853 --> 00:23:09,352
It's a mistake.

519
00:23:09,422 --> 00:23:11,422
Brenda couldn't have a
baby. She wasn't pregnant!

520
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:12,701
She was and she did.

521
00:23:12,725 --> 00:23:15,359
It was your wife. Shotgun wound.

522
00:23:15,428 --> 00:23:16,638
Had a baby.

523
00:23:16,662 --> 00:23:17,902
No, she couldn't get pregnant!

524
00:23:18,697 --> 00:23:21,398
We tried! For years!

525
00:23:21,467 --> 00:23:24,301
We saw doctors. All of
them said we couldn't.

526
00:23:24,369 --> 00:23:28,071
And Brenda was so sad.

527
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:32,259
And mad, at herself, and at
me 'cause we can't have a baby.

528
00:23:32,328 --> 00:23:33,811
You do.

529
00:23:33,879 --> 00:23:35,245
We didn't know it?

530
00:23:35,314 --> 00:23:36,625
We just didn't know
she was pregnant?

531
00:23:36,649 --> 00:23:37,831
It happens.

532
00:23:42,354 --> 00:23:44,722
This was the whole
reason for the hunting trips

533
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:47,758
and the jet skis,
trips to Bali and stuff.

534
00:23:47,827 --> 00:23:51,979
I said to her, "Babe,
if it's just gonna be us,

535
00:23:52,048 --> 00:23:53,631
"let's make us an adventure."

536
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,400
But she really wanted a baby.

537
00:23:58,103 --> 00:23:59,303
We both did.

538
00:24:03,992 --> 00:24:05,603
You can hold her if you want.

539
00:24:05,627 --> 00:24:07,144
Yeah?

540
00:24:07,212 --> 00:24:09,129
Yeah. Yes.

541
00:24:10,433 --> 00:24:11,899
How's my wife?

542
00:24:11,967 --> 00:24:13,495
She's gonna die if
I don't get that out.

543
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:15,296
The pellet is bouncing all
around the right ventricle.

544
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,232
That's what's causing
her arrhythmias.

545
00:24:17,256 --> 00:24:18,496
I'm gonna have to open her up.

546
00:24:18,557 --> 00:24:20,201
Let's get ready to
put her on bypass!

547
00:24:20,225 --> 00:24:21,803
Damn it, how did we get here?

548
00:24:21,827 --> 00:24:23,805
Look, she had a baby she
never had a chance to hold,

549
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:25,323
- so if you could just...
- That's not helping.

550
00:24:25,347 --> 00:24:26,830
I'll prep the femoral artery.

551
00:24:26,898 --> 00:24:28,644
- She's arresting!
- Crash cart!

552
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:32,752
Charge to 200.

553
00:24:32,839 --> 00:24:34,032
Husband wants to
know how she's doing.

554
00:24:34,056 --> 00:24:35,600
Clear! ALEX: Oh, crap.

555
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:42,323
- I have a pulse.
- We have sinus!

556
00:24:42,347 --> 00:24:43,892
Splash her with Betadine.
Get me some towels.

557
00:24:43,916 --> 00:24:45,860
For what it's worth, this
is kind of a miracle baby.

558
00:24:45,884 --> 00:24:47,228
I mean, they never
thought they could have one.

559
00:24:47,252 --> 00:24:48,969
So, you might be
saving a whole family.

560
00:24:49,038 --> 00:24:52,422
None of this is
helping me! Ten blade!

561
00:24:52,474 --> 00:24:54,834
She's gonna die if
I don't get that out.

562
00:25:18,684 --> 00:25:19,917
God...

563
00:25:27,693 --> 00:25:29,026
I don't know.

564
00:25:29,762 --> 00:25:32,963
I don't know, uh,

565
00:25:33,832 --> 00:25:37,868
if you're out there or not

566
00:25:37,937 --> 00:25:43,006
or if you can even hear people
who don't know if you're out there.

567
00:25:43,075 --> 00:25:45,609
Or if you give a crap
about what they say.

568
00:25:45,678 --> 00:25:49,696
But, um, God, Yahweh,

569
00:25:49,765 --> 00:25:52,349
Buddha, E.T., whatever...

570
00:25:53,336 --> 00:25:57,537
April knows.

571
00:25:57,606 --> 00:26:00,007
Right? She believes.

572
00:26:00,075 --> 00:26:02,742
And she needs you. So, uh...

573
00:26:08,451 --> 00:26:11,084
Um, show up for her?

574
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,153
Please?

575
00:26:17,493 --> 00:26:20,110
Show up for April.

576
00:26:20,179 --> 00:26:22,762
She loves you. She needs you.

577
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,932
Please, uh...

578
00:26:27,403 --> 00:26:29,936
Show up for her.

579
00:26:34,377 --> 00:26:35,909
Please.

580
00:27:07,993 --> 00:27:10,260
Didn't expect to see you here.

581
00:27:10,329 --> 00:27:14,781
They asked me for some
privacy, so I'm staying away.

582
00:27:24,677 --> 00:27:26,960
What can I do?

583
00:27:27,028 --> 00:27:30,747
How many months has it
been since that day in Boston?

584
00:27:31,183 --> 00:27:32,683
Um...

585
00:27:32,751 --> 00:27:34,517
About six.

586
00:27:34,586 --> 00:27:37,387
Six months. Six.

587
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:41,624
Yet it took something like this

588
00:27:41,693 --> 00:27:43,538
for you to pick up
a phone and call.

589
00:27:43,562 --> 00:27:46,930
I wanted to, uh,
several times, I...

590
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:50,567
Richard, I think we don't need

591
00:27:50,636 --> 00:27:52,903
to talk about that right now.

592
00:27:54,824 --> 00:27:56,122
Okay.

593
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:11,821
If there's any way I can help,

594
00:28:11,891 --> 00:28:14,992
if there is anything
that I can do for you,

595
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:18,528
or for them, I'm here.

596
00:28:18,597 --> 00:28:20,957
I think I just want to be alone.

597
00:28:31,877 --> 00:28:33,772
And you have to keep the
laser moving all the time.

598
00:28:33,796 --> 00:28:37,314
Remove the tumor cell by cell
like zapping dust off of a carpet.

599
00:28:37,383 --> 00:28:39,700
Without singeing the carpet.
- Exactly.

600
00:28:39,768 --> 00:28:41,668
Now, when we use
this on Herman's tumor,

601
00:28:41,737 --> 00:28:44,037
it'll be on her optic
chiasm and nerve.

602
00:28:44,105 --> 00:28:45,706
And rather than
restoring Drew's sight,

603
00:28:45,774 --> 00:28:47,368
we'll have to keep
her from going blind.

604
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:49,692
See. There. You just said it.

605
00:28:49,762 --> 00:28:50,994
Said what?

606
00:28:51,063 --> 00:28:52,240
You said, "Restoring
Drew's sight."

607
00:28:52,264 --> 00:28:53,925
You need to let
that go. I knew it.

608
00:28:53,949 --> 00:28:55,360
You wouldn't have said
it if you couldn't do it.

609
00:28:55,384 --> 00:28:56,461
You wouldn't have even tried.

610
00:28:56,485 --> 00:28:57,951
The tumor is everywhere.

611
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:59,898
It's impossible. I knew that
20 minutes into this surgery.

612
00:28:59,922 --> 00:29:02,305
Okay, so, why don't you
stop? Why are you still working?

613
00:29:02,374 --> 00:29:03,407
To improve my technique.

614
00:29:03,475 --> 00:29:04,515
That's...

615
00:29:06,779 --> 00:29:08,656
You should stop. Why?

616
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,774
You don't feel the
slightest bit guilty?

617
00:29:09,798 --> 00:29:10,981
Guilty? Why?

618
00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:12,843
For using this nice, funny man,

619
00:29:12,867 --> 00:29:14,712
for turning him
into a skills lab.

620
00:29:14,736 --> 00:29:17,303
I can't use a human
being for practice.

621
00:29:17,372 --> 00:29:20,807
You feel guilty because
you are thinking about you.

622
00:29:20,876 --> 00:29:22,453
And this has nothing
to do with you.

623
00:29:22,477 --> 00:29:24,978
This is about Drew.
This was his last hope.

624
00:29:25,047 --> 00:29:27,213
The chances were
slim, and Drew knew that.

625
00:29:27,299 --> 00:29:29,699
So I am thinking
about what to say to him

626
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:31,902
when he finds out that
that last hope is gone.

627
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:33,447
That is what you
should be thinking about,

628
00:29:33,471 --> 00:29:34,521
not your own guilt.

629
00:29:39,195 --> 00:29:40,956
Clamps off. Up with the flow.

630
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,412
Come on, start beating.

631
00:29:44,466 --> 00:29:45,927
All right, we're gonna
have to use some electricity.

632
00:29:45,951 --> 00:29:47,734
Charge the paddles to 20.

633
00:29:51,323 --> 00:29:53,234
Charged. MAGGIE: Clear.

634
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:56,371
Oh, God. Again.

635
00:29:56,395 --> 00:29:57,689
Her heart's been
through a lot today.

636
00:29:57,713 --> 00:29:58,940
She got shot and she had a baby.

637
00:29:58,964 --> 00:30:00,524
Clear!

638
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:13,643
Brenda! You are
going to hold your baby.

639
00:30:13,712 --> 00:30:15,295
Do you understand me?

640
00:30:15,364 --> 00:30:18,648
You have a little girl
who wants to meet you,

641
00:30:18,717 --> 00:30:20,767
so you are going
to show up for that

642
00:30:20,836 --> 00:30:22,036
and you are going to hold her.

643
00:30:23,171 --> 00:30:24,271
Clear!

644
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:28,541
I got things covered. You
don't have to be here if...

645
00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:30,188
You don't want me here? No.

646
00:30:30,212 --> 00:30:31,961
No, this place doesn't
work without you.

647
00:30:32,031 --> 00:30:33,763
It's been a mess here today.

648
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:36,983
I need you here, but not if
you don't need to be here.

649
00:30:37,052 --> 00:30:38,669
I want to be here.

650
00:30:38,737 --> 00:30:41,166
No one has seen my mysterious
intern. No one's even heard of her.

651
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:42,900
I run the ER. I
know every intern.

652
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:44,552
What's her name? I don't know.

653
00:30:44,576 --> 00:30:46,905
I mean, she's dark-haired, she's
got a vacant look on her face,

654
00:30:46,929 --> 00:30:49,146
and she's right there.

655
00:30:49,215 --> 00:30:50,847
Hey! Hey, you.

656
00:30:50,916 --> 00:30:52,877
Why didn't you do what
I asked you to? Warren.

657
00:30:52,901 --> 00:30:55,018
I'm sorry. I don't know if...

658
00:30:55,087 --> 00:30:56,364
And why do you still have this?

659
00:30:56,388 --> 00:30:57,499
I told you this
morning to just...

660
00:30:57,523 --> 00:30:58,555
Stop it right now.

661
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,492
You don't work here, do you?

662
00:31:04,129 --> 00:31:06,329
What's your name? Wendy.

663
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:11,217
These are personal release
papers for a deceased patient.

664
00:31:12,872 --> 00:31:14,187
Who is this patient?

665
00:31:15,824 --> 00:31:17,074
My fiance.

666
00:31:20,395 --> 00:31:21,627
You came in last night.

667
00:31:24,733 --> 00:31:26,033
I couldn't go home.

668
00:31:33,992 --> 00:31:35,703
Michael and I were driving
home from this lodge.

669
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:39,062
We thought we might
have our wedding there.

670
00:31:39,131 --> 00:31:41,431
And then there was
a big truck, and then...

671
00:31:42,551 --> 00:31:44,551
Everyone's been really nice.

672
00:31:44,619 --> 00:31:45,885
They got me cleaned up.

673
00:31:45,954 --> 00:31:47,521
Someone gave me
these clothes to wear

674
00:31:47,589 --> 00:31:49,789
because mine were covered in...

675
00:31:51,226 --> 00:31:52,759
I went down to the cafeteria.

676
00:31:52,827 --> 00:31:54,444
I think they thought
I was a doctor.

677
00:31:54,513 --> 00:31:56,029
They gave me food.

678
00:31:56,115 --> 00:32:00,333
I went upstairs to the
nursery. I looked at the babies.

679
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:04,187
And it made me
feel a little better.

680
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:06,823
I'm sorry if I messed up
things for that one doctor.

681
00:32:06,892 --> 00:32:08,691
I wasn't sure...

682
00:32:13,498 --> 00:32:14,743
They told me I could take

683
00:32:14,767 --> 00:32:16,066
Michael's things home with me

684
00:32:16,135 --> 00:32:17,533
when I was ready.

685
00:32:19,271 --> 00:32:20,553
I haven't been ready.

686
00:32:22,307 --> 00:32:24,174
I know.

687
00:32:24,243 --> 00:32:26,075
We were gonna do so many things.

688
00:32:26,145 --> 00:32:28,145
This was our beginning.

689
00:32:28,213 --> 00:32:32,448
We had so many plans
for a life and a family,

690
00:32:32,517 --> 00:32:33,850
and now they're gone!

691
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:34,935
They're gone.

692
00:32:40,725 --> 00:32:42,326
Wendy, do you believe in God?

693
00:32:42,911 --> 00:32:44,210
Yes.

694
00:32:45,246 --> 00:32:46,646
But he didn't.

695
00:32:46,715 --> 00:32:47,715
Michael didn't believe.

696
00:32:47,783 --> 00:32:48,882
It's okay.

697
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:51,310
You can believe
enough for the two of you.

698
00:32:52,187 --> 00:32:54,320
You have lost somebody,

699
00:32:55,691 --> 00:32:57,391
and you are hurting,

700
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,910
but you will get through this.

701
00:33:02,398 --> 00:33:05,399
You can survive this.

702
00:33:07,803 --> 00:33:10,504
You are strong.

703
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:14,691
It's okay.

704
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:18,778
You are gonna be okay.

705
00:33:18,864 --> 00:33:20,364
I promise.

706
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:27,937
<i>Samuel Norbert Avery.</i>

707
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:29,639
That should be our son's name.

708
00:33:29,708 --> 00:33:31,188
It should? Yeah.

709
00:33:32,777 --> 00:33:34,944
I think I got what
I was waiting for.

710
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:37,196
You did?

711
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:40,884
Let's go back upstairs.

712
00:33:40,953 --> 00:33:42,235
I'm ready now.

713
00:34:07,513 --> 00:34:09,178
Meredith?

714
00:34:09,247 --> 00:34:11,481
Uh, my plans have changed.

715
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:13,232
I'd be happy to take
your weekend call.

716
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:14,912
You should go.
Thanks, but it's fine.

717
00:34:14,936 --> 00:34:16,630
I can go another
time. It's not a big deal.

718
00:34:16,654 --> 00:34:18,688
Take it from a man
who has spent his life

719
00:34:18,757 --> 00:34:21,124
regretting the
flights he never took.

720
00:34:21,193 --> 00:34:24,393
Get on the plane, see Derek.

721
00:34:24,462 --> 00:34:26,879
It is a big deal.

722
00:34:26,948 --> 00:34:28,859
But I don't have
anyone to watch my kids

723
00:34:28,883 --> 00:34:30,150
and Amelia is working, so...

724
00:34:30,218 --> 00:34:31,479
I am here. What?

725
00:34:31,503 --> 00:34:33,320
I said I'm here.

726
00:34:33,388 --> 00:34:35,399
I moved here alone and
I have made one friend,

727
00:34:35,423 --> 00:34:37,674
and I consider you my friend.

728
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:38,986
Oh, I just... I mean,
I didn't even...

729
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:40,221
No, I'm just saying.

730
00:34:40,245 --> 00:34:42,178
If you ever need something,

731
00:34:42,247 --> 00:34:44,948
like if you ever
need help moving

732
00:34:45,016 --> 00:34:47,095
or, like, a ride to the airport,
like, I'm that kind of friend.

733
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:48,563
But I can't ask you
to babysit my kids.

734
00:34:48,587 --> 00:34:49,948
Are you kidding
me? I would love to.

735
00:34:49,972 --> 00:34:51,515
I was a Girl Scout,
and I was registered

736
00:34:51,539 --> 00:34:53,450
with a babysitting
service as a teenager.

737
00:34:53,474 --> 00:34:55,058
And I'm good.

738
00:34:55,126 --> 00:34:57,504
I mean, I'm a "play on the floor
and cook for them" babysitter.

739
00:34:57,528 --> 00:34:58,823
You cook? And I bake.

740
00:34:58,847 --> 00:35:01,860
Kids love baking, and I love
babies, and babies love me.

741
00:35:01,884 --> 00:35:04,217
And, you know, they're
my niece and nephew,

742
00:35:04,286 --> 00:35:06,786
so I would love
to. I would love to.

743
00:35:06,855 --> 00:35:08,388
You don't have to bake.

744
00:35:08,474 --> 00:35:10,122
Okay, but can I?

745
00:35:11,893 --> 00:35:13,326
We were pretty successful.

746
00:35:13,394 --> 00:35:16,295
We were able to remove
about 98% of your tumor,

747
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:19,065
so you've got a few
more years coming to you.

748
00:35:19,151 --> 00:35:22,671
Oh, well, I haven't been able to
bring myself to open up my eyes yet.

749
00:35:23,054 --> 00:35:24,370
Why don't you do that now?

750
00:35:24,439 --> 00:35:25,738
Okay.

751
00:35:41,406 --> 00:35:43,451
Somebody say something
so I know who's who.

752
00:35:43,475 --> 00:35:45,002
You can see? Yeah.

753
00:35:45,026 --> 00:35:47,744
It's blurry, but it's... Yeah!

754
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:50,046
Okay, that may
improve, it may not.

755
00:35:50,115 --> 00:35:51,781
Drew, we'll run
some tests, but...

756
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:55,210
It's... But that's... I didn't
think that I should hope.

757
00:35:56,671 --> 00:35:58,391
Dr. Lavender.

758
00:36:00,692 --> 00:36:01,858
You did it.

759
00:36:01,926 --> 00:36:03,304
I mean, I knew you could do it.

760
00:36:03,328 --> 00:36:04,706
Even when you said
it was impossible.

761
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:05,895
Because it was.

762
00:36:05,964 --> 00:36:07,141
But you pulled it off!

763
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:09,515
And you said to stop.
That's the difference.

764
00:36:09,585 --> 00:36:11,718
I know what it is to
walk into a hospital OR

765
00:36:11,787 --> 00:36:13,820
with little or no
chance of success,

766
00:36:13,889 --> 00:36:16,222
to do all of the planning
and hoping and labor,

767
00:36:16,291 --> 00:36:18,658
knowing that in the end,
it may amount to nothing.

768
00:36:18,727 --> 00:36:21,093
It's impossible. But it
is what is asked of us.

769
00:36:21,162 --> 00:36:22,561
And if you can't do it,

770
00:36:22,631 --> 00:36:24,475
if you aren't willing to
keep looking for light

771
00:36:24,499 --> 00:36:26,966
in the darkest of
places without stopping

772
00:36:27,035 --> 00:36:29,502
even when it seems impossible,
you will never succeed.

773
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:31,871
What I am doing next with Herman

774
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:34,557
is much, much harder than this.

775
00:36:34,626 --> 00:36:37,627
I only need to be better, and I
am gonna get there any way I can.

776
00:36:37,696 --> 00:36:39,195
If you are not
willing to do that,

777
00:36:39,264 --> 00:36:40,775
then you shouldn't
be working with me

778
00:36:40,799 --> 00:36:42,226
and you probably
shouldn't be a surgeon.

779
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:43,516
Understand?

780
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:50,757
Everything all right?

781
00:36:52,427 --> 00:36:53,443
Yep.

782
00:37:00,168 --> 00:37:02,780
Hey, the candle thing
does work, by the way.

783
00:37:02,804 --> 00:37:04,470
So, thanks for that.

784
00:37:12,397 --> 00:37:15,048
Howard? Are you okay?

785
00:37:15,116 --> 00:37:16,349
Yeah.

786
00:37:16,435 --> 00:37:17,650
No.

787
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:19,486
This is just a lot for one day.

788
00:37:19,554 --> 00:37:21,220
For a lifetime.

789
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:22,950
You ready?

790
00:37:22,974 --> 00:37:24,040
Yeah.

791
00:37:27,946 --> 00:37:30,113
Oh, that's her.

792
00:37:30,181 --> 00:37:31,580
She's real?

793
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:34,771
Here she is. Oh!

794
00:37:35,704 --> 00:37:37,270
Here's mama.

795
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:38,772
Oh.

796
00:37:39,307 --> 00:37:42,842
Look at you.

797
00:37:42,911 --> 00:37:44,844
Oh, look at you.

798
00:37:44,912 --> 00:37:47,046
You look just like your daddy.

799
00:37:47,114 --> 00:37:49,799
You have his nice chin.

800
00:37:54,822 --> 00:37:55,822
Oh.

801
00:39:01,272 --> 00:39:02,449
He squeezed my finger.

802
00:39:02,473 --> 00:39:03,539
Oh.

803
00:39:08,029 --> 00:39:09,862
And then he let go.

804
00:39:12,266 --> 00:39:14,667
<i>We can't get too close.</i>

805
00:39:16,621 --> 00:39:20,222
<i>If we felt even a little
of the love and the joy</i>

806
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:23,660
<i>and the hopes that our
patients are saying goodbye to,</i>

807
00:39:27,398 --> 00:39:29,799
<i>we'd never be able to function.</i>

808
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:32,279
Is it over? Yeah.

809
00:39:32,303 --> 00:39:34,503
I'm giving them some time.

810
00:39:34,573 --> 00:39:36,005
Thank you for today.

811
00:39:36,074 --> 00:39:39,234
I think that it would have
been harder to be in there.

812
00:39:40,411 --> 00:39:43,813
It's never easy for anybody.

813
00:39:43,882 --> 00:39:47,884
<i>So we say, "We're
sorry for your loss."</i>

814
00:39:52,874 --> 00:39:55,608
<i>And we hope it offers something.</i>

815
00:40:12,393 --> 00:40:15,211
Can you just take me home?

816
00:40:16,415 --> 00:40:20,049
Take me home, take me to bed,

817
00:40:20,118 --> 00:40:21,918
and just hold me?

818
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:35,414
<i>Some little bit of support.</i>

819
00:40:53,518 --> 00:40:55,451
<i>Some bit of peace.</i>

820
00:41:00,191 --> 00:41:02,258
<i>Some bit of closure.</i>

821
00:41:20,061 --> 00:41:22,661
<i>Something good.</i>

822
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:27,433
<i>Some little piece of beauty in
the midst of some place dark.</i>

823
00:41:41,449 --> 00:41:43,816
My baby lived for 43 minutes.

824
00:41:55,714 --> 00:41:58,047
<i>An unexpected gift</i>

825
00:42:01,569 --> 00:42:04,120
<i>just when it's needed most.</i>
