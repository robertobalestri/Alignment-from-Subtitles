1
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:17,749
There's no milk.

2
00:00:17,818 --> 00:00:18,934
Oh.

3
00:00:19,002 --> 00:00:20,436
Damn, I forgot.

4
00:00:20,504 --> 00:00:22,704
All I ask is for you
to get the groceries.

5
00:00:22,773 --> 00:00:25,474
And I forgot. I'm sorry.

6
00:00:25,542 --> 00:00:27,820
You know, it's not
like I'm sitting around.

7
00:00:27,844 --> 00:00:29,144
I'm looking for a job.

8
00:00:29,212 --> 00:00:30,823
Well, now we're gonna
have to stop for coffee

9
00:00:30,847 --> 00:00:32,714
before you drop me off at work.

10
00:00:32,783 --> 00:00:34,883
<i>Even good marriages fail.</i>

11
00:00:34,951 --> 00:00:37,486
<i>One minute you're
standing on solid ground.</i>

12
00:00:37,554 --> 00:00:39,688
<i>The next minute, you're not.</i>

13
00:00:44,561 --> 00:00:47,721
Baby's up. You change
the diaper. I'll get the bottle.

14
00:00:48,432 --> 00:00:50,243
<i>And there's always
two versions...</i>

15
00:00:52,369 --> 00:00:53,769
<i>Yours...</i>

16
00:00:57,641 --> 00:00:59,007
<i>And theirs.</i>

17
00:00:59,076 --> 00:01:01,844
So they're living
together at your house,

18
00:01:01,912 --> 00:01:03,277
Kepner says.

19
00:01:03,346 --> 00:01:05,497
This is my house.

20
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:06,943
Did she say how they're doing?

21
00:01:06,967 --> 00:01:09,034
No. I didn't ask.

22
00:01:09,103 --> 00:01:10,303
I don't care.

23
00:01:11,522 --> 00:01:12,582
You...

24
00:01:12,606 --> 00:01:14,472
Want me to ask, for you?

25
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:17,208
No. I don't care, either.

26
00:01:21,064 --> 00:01:22,224
Hand me a rock.

27
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:34,126
Okay. I'm... I can't.

28
00:01:34,194 --> 00:01:35,905
I can't have sex
when there's a baby

29
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:37,574
from a broken home
in the next room.

30
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:38,797
I...

31
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,769
<i>Both versions start
the same way, though.</i>

32
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:46,271
<i>Both start with two
people falling in love.</i>

33
00:01:48,175 --> 00:01:49,925
Yeah, you can.

34
00:01:49,993 --> 00:01:51,426
Just look at me.

35
00:01:55,231 --> 00:01:57,271
It's just you and me.

36
00:02:10,564 --> 00:02:12,447
Dude, you snore like a truck.

37
00:02:12,516 --> 00:02:14,049
I'm gonna put a
note in your chart,

38
00:02:14,118 --> 00:02:16,001
'cause you mix apnea
with your heart crap,

39
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:17,485
and you're dead
before you're 60.

40
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:23,876
Excuse me.

41
00:02:23,944 --> 00:02:25,054
Hey. Hey.

42
00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:26,506
You guys going to
that breakfast thing?

43
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:27,973
Yeah, after we drop
her off at day care.

44
00:02:27,997 --> 00:02:31,766
Oh, my God. Look at
her. She's so beautiful.

45
00:02:31,835 --> 00:02:33,268
Oh, oh. Hey.

46
00:02:33,337 --> 00:02:35,415
Hey, you are so
beautiful... Here you go.

47
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:36,950
And you've got the best mommies.

48
00:02:36,974 --> 00:02:39,252
Did you know that? Yes, you do.

49
00:02:39,276 --> 00:02:40,608
Oh, you do.

50
00:02:40,694 --> 00:02:41,737
Oh, you so do.

51
00:02:43,147 --> 00:02:45,074
Hello. Hello, hello, hello.

52
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:46,147
What is wrong with her?

53
00:02:46,216 --> 00:02:48,549
She's getting laid. She's
unnaturally cheerful.

54
00:02:48,619 --> 00:02:50,518
Peekaboo.

55
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:52,565
A month ago you were in med
school being taught by doctors,

56
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:54,656
and now you are the doctors.

57
00:02:54,725 --> 00:02:56,765
Will we be going
into an OR today?

58
00:02:56,827 --> 00:02:58,192
Oh, I hope so.

59
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:01,763
Oh! New interns.

60
00:03:01,832 --> 00:03:02,997
I hate new interns.

61
00:03:03,066 --> 00:03:04,666
Seriously? Ugh. Mmm-hmm.

62
00:03:04,701 --> 00:03:06,100
I love new interns.

63
00:03:06,169 --> 00:03:07,652
They're the future,

64
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:09,387
the next generation,

65
00:03:09,456 --> 00:03:12,090
filled with hope and
promise, innovation.

66
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,208
Wow.

67
00:03:13,277 --> 00:03:15,126
The sex with Henry
must be really good.

68
00:03:15,178 --> 00:03:16,378
Earth-shattering.

69
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:17,646
Shh.

70
00:03:17,715 --> 00:03:19,159
Not even Yang's
gonna get me down.

71
00:03:19,183 --> 00:03:20,816
No, she's not.

72
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:25,870
Good morning, and welcome
to your fifth year of residency.

73
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:27,417
Oh, morning. Morning.

74
00:03:27,441 --> 00:03:29,758
See you guys up there. I
hear there's an omelet station.

75
00:03:31,928 --> 00:03:33,189
You have a good day.

76
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,563
Okay, now. Bye-bye.

77
00:03:44,074 --> 00:03:46,754
Okay, um, I'll see you
later at the thing. Okay.

78
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,729
She slept through the night...

79
00:03:51,798 --> 00:03:53,426
Hey, Zola. And ate like a champ.

80
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:55,400
I missed you. Can we talk?

81
00:03:55,469 --> 00:03:58,364
I want to spend time with Zola
before I drop her off at day care.

82
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:04,209
Are you gonna call Glen today?

83
00:04:04,278 --> 00:04:05,843
I don't know, you know...

84
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:07,212
The guy is an ass.

85
00:04:07,281 --> 00:04:09,847
Do I really want
to work for him?

86
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:11,794
Maybe you should
stop being so choosy.

87
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:13,963
Well, I just got laid off
four months ago. All right?

88
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:15,386
I mean, these things take time.

89
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:17,266
It's all about pursuing leads
and making connections.

90
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:19,168
I know how a person
gets a job, Danny.

91
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:20,592
I have one, remember?

92
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:29,551
Good morning,

93
00:04:29,619 --> 00:04:31,920
and welcome to your
final year of residency.

94
00:04:32,422 --> 00:04:33,588
Um...

95
00:04:33,657 --> 00:04:35,134
This breakfast is the one time

96
00:04:35,158 --> 00:04:36,936
when all the fifth years
and the attendings

97
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,310
will be in the same room.

98
00:04:38,362 --> 00:04:41,396
So use your time
wisely, residents.

99
00:04:42,132 --> 00:04:44,232
Find a mentor,

100
00:04:44,301 --> 00:04:47,268
ask questions, get
advice on your futures.

101
00:04:49,255 --> 00:04:52,991
And I see you're already
chatting away, so that's good.

102
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:55,927
Just carry on.

103
00:05:01,935 --> 00:05:04,068
Hey. Dr. Bailey,
how did you do it?

104
00:05:05,956 --> 00:05:08,206
I put down the
English muffin first,

105
00:05:08,274 --> 00:05:09,902
then the bacon, then
the eggs. Oh, no...

106
00:05:09,926 --> 00:05:12,188
Now some people may
be surprised by this method,

107
00:05:12,212 --> 00:05:14,357
thinking you put the
bacon on top of the eggs,

108
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:17,949
and those people
would be right because...

109
00:05:18,018 --> 00:05:20,518
You see what I'm doing?

110
00:05:20,587 --> 00:05:24,973
Bam! An extra layer
of bacon right on top.

111
00:05:25,042 --> 00:05:27,971
Then you put on the
other half of the muffin.

112
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:30,395
And there you go. That's
a breakfast sandwich.

113
00:05:30,464 --> 00:05:32,430
No, no, uh, I mean,

114
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:35,033
how did you get people to
listen to you as Chief Resident?

115
00:05:35,102 --> 00:05:37,703
Dr. Kepner, I am eating.
Leave me alone with my food.

116
00:05:37,771 --> 00:05:39,637
Figure it out on your own. Uh...

117
00:05:41,524 --> 00:05:42,557
Did he talk to you?

118
00:05:42,626 --> 00:05:44,837
No, he won't even look at me.

119
00:05:44,861 --> 00:05:46,928
You tampered
with his clinical trial.

120
00:05:46,997 --> 00:05:48,713
He thinks that's
kind of unforgivable.

121
00:05:48,782 --> 00:05:50,676
It was for Adele and
the chief. I know you...

122
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:54,102
You regret that you messed up
his trial but not what you did, I know.

123
00:05:54,171 --> 00:05:56,053
You don't have to
defend yourself to me.

124
00:05:56,122 --> 00:05:57,472
I'm kind of...

125
00:05:57,541 --> 00:05:59,373
Unforgivable myself, remember?

126
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:01,070
But you're not.
Not yet, at least.

127
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:02,338
Have you told him?

128
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:03,828
Well...

129
00:06:03,897 --> 00:06:05,997
I call him, he doesn't pick up.

130
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:07,665
He sees me, he walks away.

131
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:09,333
Okay, I'm not gonna yell,

132
00:06:09,403 --> 00:06:11,497
"I didn't get the abortion
yet" down the hallway.

133
00:06:11,521 --> 00:06:13,599
Well, so are you going
to go through with it,

134
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:16,543
or are we gonna sit there
again and not get the abortion?

135
00:06:18,394 --> 00:06:20,595
Tonight. 6:00. I'm doing it.

136
00:06:22,765 --> 00:06:25,016
Oh. Gotta go suck up to Teddy.

137
00:06:26,186 --> 00:06:27,452
You want plastics?

138
00:06:27,521 --> 00:06:29,321
I don't see it.

139
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,534
Is this about Lexie? 'Cause I
thought you were good with that.

140
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:34,226
This isn't about sex.
It's about medicine.

141
00:06:34,294 --> 00:06:35,910
Then I don't understand.

142
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:37,219
You're a good surgeon.

143
00:06:38,014 --> 00:06:39,547
Not a great surgeon,

144
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:41,935
which is why I was surprised
Lexie was even into you.

145
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:44,236
But this isn't about Lexie.

146
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:46,354
Nope.

147
00:06:48,692 --> 00:06:50,937
How's she doing, by the way?

148
00:06:52,562 --> 00:06:53,578
Wow.

149
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:59,250
"Oh, God. What
is she doing here?"

150
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:01,536
I don't... What?

151
00:07:01,604 --> 00:07:02,849
Is what you're thinking, right?

152
00:07:02,873 --> 00:07:04,667
I mean, you thought that I
would run away to Germany

153
00:07:04,691 --> 00:07:05,801
and you wouldn't
have to see me again,

154
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:07,659
which was a relief,

155
00:07:07,728 --> 00:07:10,888
I mean, after all the drama that
we've been through in the last year.

156
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:14,432
I'm right. Tell me I'm right.

157
00:07:14,501 --> 00:07:16,351
I... Okay, so here's the deal.

158
00:07:16,419 --> 00:07:18,864
I'm here and I'm in a happy
place and I'm done with drama.

159
00:07:18,888 --> 00:07:21,048
So if you want to
learn, I want to teach.

160
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:23,548
Great. Yay.

161
00:07:26,129 --> 00:07:27,807
Alex, this is serious.

162
00:07:27,831 --> 00:07:29,409
If you want the Peds
Fellowship next year,

163
00:07:29,433 --> 00:07:30,749
you're gonna have to earn it.

164
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:33,284
I just brought over a bunch
of sick kids from Africa.

165
00:07:33,353 --> 00:07:34,881
Well, did you publish
an article about it?

166
00:07:34,905 --> 00:07:36,415
Because all the people
applying for Peds Fellowships,

167
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:37,605
they've all been published.

168
00:07:37,673 --> 00:07:38,701
You're already getting resumes?

169
00:07:38,725 --> 00:07:40,225
Yes, and you're way behind.

170
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,171
Listen, I hate to kick a
guy when he's down, but...

171
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:44,340
I know. Who's
down? I'm not down.

172
00:07:44,364 --> 00:07:46,709
Everybody hates you because
you narced on a fellow surgeon.

173
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:48,399
You're a pariah.

174
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:51,229
You're living in the hospital, and
you look like a bum and you've...

175
00:07:51,438 --> 00:07:52,837
Got really bad breath.

176
00:07:52,906 --> 00:07:55,072
Really, really bad.

177
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:56,507
Do you need me to go on? I...

178
00:07:56,576 --> 00:07:57,696
No, I'm good.

179
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:01,345
Oh! Look, here's the chief!

180
00:08:02,783 --> 00:08:05,033
Chief, is there anything
you'd like to say

181
00:08:05,101 --> 00:08:08,069
as we embark on our
final year of residency?

182
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:16,450
You all know what you're doing.

183
00:08:16,613 --> 00:08:18,346
Just don't kill anyone.

184
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:23,034
Uh, Meredith, can I
see you in my office?

185
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:30,391
Well, that was
very inspirational.

186
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:33,427
Thank you, Chief.

187
00:08:33,496 --> 00:08:35,958
<i>Nobody gets married
thinking it's gonna fail.</i>

188
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:38,933
Well, you're the one who
needed the big wedding.

189
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:40,385
What is that supposed to mean?

190
00:08:40,453 --> 00:08:41,998
It means, if we still
had our savings,

191
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:44,200
my being laid off wouldn't
be such a big deal.

192
00:08:44,224 --> 00:08:45,502
No, we decided on that together.

193
00:08:45,526 --> 00:08:46,636
We both wanted that wedding.

194
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,059
No, we didn't.

195
00:08:48,128 --> 00:08:49,906
You and your mother are the...

196
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:51,646
Stop the car. Calm down.

197
00:08:51,714 --> 00:08:52,747
I mean it, Danny.

198
00:08:52,816 --> 00:08:54,199
You're being crazy.

199
00:08:54,268 --> 00:08:55,778
What, are you gonna
walk to work from here?

200
00:08:55,802 --> 00:08:56,945
What the hell are you doing?

201
00:08:56,969 --> 00:08:58,919
Stop the car!

202
00:08:58,989 --> 00:09:01,669
<i>You think yours is the
one that's gonna make it.</i>

203
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:05,038
Derek's refusing to
work with me, isn't he?

204
00:09:07,513 --> 00:09:10,181
The board met this morning.

205
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:13,919
They feel that a suspension
would send the wrong message.

206
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:19,423
They feel that what you
did disgraced the hospital.

207
00:09:20,594 --> 00:09:21,926
The profession.

208
00:09:24,865 --> 00:09:26,197
I'm sorry.

209
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,833
I did everything I could.

210
00:09:31,471 --> 00:09:32,711
So what are you saying?

211
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:38,310
You're fired,

212
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:41,679
effective immediately.

213
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:44,549
You're no longer a
doctor at Seattle Grace.

214
00:09:44,618 --> 00:09:46,584
<i>And so it always
comes as a shock...</i>

215
00:09:48,121 --> 00:09:50,238
<i>The moment when
you realize it's over.</i>

216
00:09:50,307 --> 00:09:52,185
You walk away,
and I swear, that's it.

217
00:09:52,209 --> 00:09:54,303
All right, I am not
gonna chase after you.

218
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:56,767
You get out of this
car and we are done.

219
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,103
Aah!

220
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:07,588
Susannah!

221
00:10:11,827 --> 00:10:13,377
Whoa! Oh!

222
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,792
<i>One minute you're
standing on solid ground.</i>

223
00:10:15,816 --> 00:10:17,715
<i>The next minute you're not.</i>

224
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:31,924
We're going to the scene
of an onsite amputation

225
00:10:31,948 --> 00:10:33,693
woman's trapped under her car.

226
00:10:33,717 --> 00:10:35,227
You guys are gonna
get swamped with bodies.

227
00:10:35,251 --> 00:10:37,118
Kepner, you're in
charge till I get back.

228
00:10:37,186 --> 00:10:39,231
Yes, sir. Have fun.
At an amputation?

229
00:10:39,255 --> 00:10:40,988
Uh, I meant good luck.

230
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,205
You know what? There's
bound to be piles of head trauma.

231
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:47,440
Derek's gonna
have to talk to you.

232
00:10:47,464 --> 00:10:48,896
I got fired.

233
00:10:48,965 --> 00:10:49,981
What?

234
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,286
The chief fired me.

235
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:58,389
You son of a bitch.

236
00:10:58,458 --> 00:10:59,891
I mean, are you happy now?

237
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,593
'Cause this is all
because of you.

238
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,105
You and your big, fat, stupid mouth!
- Get off!

239
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:04,878
Kepner, control your people.

240
00:11:04,947 --> 00:11:06,247
Stop! Stop! All your fault!

241
00:11:06,316 --> 00:11:07,526
Get off. There's no hitting.

242
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:09,395
No hitting. Would
you stop right now?

243
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:10,635
Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.

244
00:11:11,955 --> 00:11:13,738
You going to the scene? Yes.

245
00:11:13,806 --> 00:11:17,241
Wait, wait. I didn't tell you
you could go. I need you here.

246
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:19,577
42-year-old female. Lost
consciousness en route.

247
00:11:19,646 --> 00:11:22,346
Unable to get airway
secondary to tracheal injury.

248
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:24,615
Last BP is 89 over 60.

249
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,784
Don't worry. We'll
figure something out.

250
00:11:26,836 --> 00:11:27,913
Make sure there is a crike tray

251
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,014
set up with the intubation kit.

252
00:11:29,038 --> 00:11:30,038
Yes, Doctor.

253
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:32,106
Come on. You can't
be here. You need to go.

254
00:11:44,938 --> 00:11:47,021
It's not stable. Get
away from there.

255
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:55,390
Dr. Torres? Yeah, hi.

256
00:11:55,414 --> 00:11:57,081
Dr. Hunt?

257
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,544
Karen Lorenz, in charge
of search and rescue.

258
00:11:58,568 --> 00:12:00,145
We're still pulling
victims out of the debris,

259
00:12:00,169 --> 00:12:02,047
but we have a couple,
Danny and Susannah Wilson,

260
00:12:02,071 --> 00:12:03,171
stuck down there.

261
00:12:03,239 --> 00:12:05,117
He has a head wound
and his ankle's messed up,

262
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:06,569
but I don't see any
other obvious injuries.

263
00:12:06,593 --> 00:12:07,970
We could potentially
bring him up,

264
00:12:07,994 --> 00:12:09,154
but he won't leave
without his wife,

265
00:12:09,178 --> 00:12:10,811
and her leg is
stuck under the car.

266
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:28,746
Take it easy.
You'll be all right.

267
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:46,330
I hope you've got me
with a decent resident.

268
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,978
I'm not babysitting any
first-day first-years today.

269
00:12:49,002 --> 00:12:51,068
Yep, I got you with Meredith.

270
00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:52,882
Coming through. Wait.
No, that's not gonna...

271
00:12:52,906 --> 00:12:54,839
That's okay. Not a
problem. I can fix this.

272
00:12:54,908 --> 00:12:57,008
Jackson, can I get
you with Bailey today?

273
00:12:57,076 --> 00:12:58,254
I'm already with Sloan. Sorry.

274
00:12:58,278 --> 00:12:59,955
Uh, okay. Yang! Yang.

275
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:01,646
Can I get you to... No.

276
00:13:02,398 --> 00:13:04,015
Okay. Um.

277
00:13:04,067 --> 00:13:06,634
Sorry, hang on.
Let me just, um...

278
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:08,035
Just figure this out.

279
00:13:08,104 --> 00:13:10,271
Hey, Grey. You're
with me. Yes, ma'am.

280
00:13:11,574 --> 00:13:14,125
Uh, okay, great. There we go.

281
00:13:18,698 --> 00:13:20,059
Dr. Kepner, three
more coming in.

282
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:21,382
Okay.

283
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:25,797
It was a water
main break on 3rd.

284
00:13:25,821 --> 00:13:27,599
Probably been going on for
weeks, and it just gave way.

285
00:13:27,623 --> 00:13:29,174
Here you go. Thanks.

286
00:13:29,242 --> 00:13:31,287
We've got a vitals monitor and
a camera, so we have a visual.

287
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:32,477
Danny, can you hear me?

288
00:13:32,546 --> 00:13:34,312
<i>She's not talking anymore.</i>

289
00:13:34,381 --> 00:13:35,774
<i>You gotta get down
here. We need help.</i>

290
00:13:35,798 --> 00:13:37,164
Danny, Danny, I'm Dr. Hunt.

291
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:40,073
Can you read out for me the
top three numbers on the monitor?

292
00:13:41,454 --> 00:13:42,520
<i>87.</i>

293
00:13:43,056 --> 00:13:44,238
<i>63.</i>

294
00:13:44,307 --> 00:13:45,473
<i>122.</i>

295
00:13:45,541 --> 00:13:47,352
BP's 87 over 63. She's shocky.

296
00:13:47,376 --> 00:13:48,520
How do we get down to her?

297
00:13:48,544 --> 00:13:50,044
You don't. It's too unstable.

298
00:13:50,112 --> 00:13:52,257
The whole thing would cave
in if we sent you down there.

299
00:13:52,281 --> 00:13:54,376
By the time we get it shored up
enough to get someone down there,

300
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,783
she'll be dead for sure.

301
00:13:55,851 --> 00:13:58,497
I thought that's why we're
here, for the amputation.

302
00:13:58,521 --> 00:13:59,882
You're gonna
talk him through it.

303
00:13:59,906 --> 00:14:02,373
You want him to
cut off his wife's leg?

304
00:14:02,441 --> 00:14:03,853
<i>Hey, you guys, I
think she's dying.</i>

305
00:14:03,877 --> 00:14:07,161
<i>Get down here!
Please hurry. Hurry!</i>

306
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:14,162
Dr. Yang, can you tell me why

307
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:16,231
you entered the pleura
with a Kelly clamp?

308
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:18,322
Why? What's wrong? Am I too low?

309
00:14:18,391 --> 00:14:19,818
Do you suspect a
traumatic herniation?

310
00:14:19,842 --> 00:14:23,110
No, no. I just want
to know your thinking.

311
00:14:23,179 --> 00:14:25,346
'Cause that's how
you put a chest tube in.

312
00:14:25,415 --> 00:14:27,415
Why? What do you mean, why?

313
00:14:27,484 --> 00:14:29,362
So you don't kill the
person when you do it wrong.

314
00:14:29,386 --> 00:14:31,664
Well, tell me like I'm an idiot,

315
00:14:31,688 --> 00:14:32,928
like I'm a medical student.

316
00:14:33,389 --> 00:14:35,172
Why?

317
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:36,535
I need to make sure that
your foundation is solid.

318
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:37,842
Why?

319
00:14:37,911 --> 00:14:39,604
I'm asking the questions,
Cristina, not you.

320
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:41,988
Tell me why you entered
the pleura that way.

321
00:14:47,254 --> 00:14:49,153
What? Is Zola all right?

322
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:51,033
It's not... She's fine. It's me.

323
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:52,601
I have to go. Derek...

324
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:53,908
Meredith, I can't. I just...

325
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:55,016
I got fired.

326
00:15:00,383 --> 00:15:02,133
What did you think
was gonna happen?

327
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:15,213
Danny, you've got a kit.

328
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:17,176
Now, they're sending
down a second harness.

329
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,278
The doctors are gonna
talk you through this, okay?

330
00:15:19,302 --> 00:15:20,318
<i>Okay.</i>

331
00:15:23,072 --> 00:15:24,772
What can I do?

332
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:26,601
Kepner called. She wants
you back at the hospital.

333
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:27,675
I can't go back there.

334
00:15:27,761 --> 00:15:29,037
Yeah, it sucks that
everyone hates you.

335
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:31,301
But you're not
hiding out here. Go.

336
00:15:31,564 --> 00:15:33,247
Did you get the kit open?

337
00:15:33,316 --> 00:15:35,015
<i>Almost.</i>

338
00:15:37,754 --> 00:15:39,720
<i>Oh, my God. No.</i>

339
00:15:39,789 --> 00:15:41,789
<i>No. No. No. No. I can't do this.</i>

340
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:43,758
Danny, Danny, you can do this.

341
00:15:43,826 --> 00:15:45,771
We have one chance
to bring you both up.

342
00:15:45,795 --> 00:15:49,024
In order to do that, you have
to amputate Susannah's leg.

343
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:51,232
<i>No. No. No.</i>

344
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,050
<i>Oh, God.</i>

345
00:15:57,523 --> 00:15:58,763
I need a C-spine!

346
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:02,493
Coming through, people.
Come on, watch your back.

347
00:16:03,229 --> 00:16:05,709
You guys headed
back? Yeah, we are.

348
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:11,769
Does anybody have a kid?

349
00:16:14,407 --> 00:16:16,447
Has anybody seen a kid around?

350
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:23,848
Where'd they pull this guy from?

351
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:26,862
We'll need immediate
transport for her.

352
00:16:26,886 --> 00:16:28,564
Yeah, give me just a
minute here, Doctor.

353
00:16:28,588 --> 00:16:29,720
I just gotta stabilize her.

354
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:37,728
I need some help over here!

355
00:16:48,491 --> 00:16:49,907
He's not breathing.

356
00:16:49,976 --> 00:16:51,776
Get an Ambu-bag and
some oxygen over here.

357
00:16:51,845 --> 00:16:52,845
Right away, Doctor.

358
00:17:01,287 --> 00:17:03,370
Oh, jeez. What happened? No.

359
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:05,122
No, no, no, no,
no, no. I need help.

360
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:06,490
I think my patient's coding.

361
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,970
You think your patient's coding?

362
00:17:07,994 --> 00:17:09,234
What's his rhythm?

363
00:17:09,763 --> 00:17:10,794
Uh...

364
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:12,479
SVT? Sinus tach?

365
00:17:12,548 --> 00:17:14,560
There shouldn't be a question
mark at the end of that sentence.

366
00:17:14,584 --> 00:17:16,624
I'm freaking out. It's
my first day of internship.

367
00:17:16,669 --> 00:17:18,413
How could this be happening?
Go back to your patient.

368
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:19,720
Does he have a pulse?

369
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:24,608
He has a pulse. Good.
Now check for breath sounds.

370
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:31,064
I kinda hear some, but
maybe the right sounds less?

371
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:32,627
You gotta stop
with the questions.

372
00:17:32,651 --> 00:17:34,146
It kinda looks like he's
barely breathing at all now.

373
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:36,436
Move, move, move.

374
00:17:36,505 --> 00:17:38,383
Tension pneumothorax. Grab
the biggest needle you can find.

375
00:17:38,407 --> 00:17:39,568
What are you doing?

376
00:17:39,592 --> 00:17:41,242
Tension pneumo.
This guy's freaking out.

377
00:17:41,311 --> 00:17:43,094
Step away, Grey.

378
00:17:46,015 --> 00:17:47,448
Uh, 14-gauge? 16-gauge?

379
00:17:47,517 --> 00:17:49,650
The biggest needle you can find!

380
00:17:59,812 --> 00:18:01,423
Okay. Get this man a chest tube.

381
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:03,375
And next time,
call your resident.

382
00:18:03,399 --> 00:18:04,877
I'm sorry. I thought
that she was a resident.

383
00:18:04,901 --> 00:18:06,633
No, she is not a resident.

384
00:18:06,702 --> 00:18:08,780
She was fired by this hospital.

385
00:18:08,804 --> 00:18:10,838
Had this man died
under her care,

386
00:18:10,906 --> 00:18:12,935
the hospital would be
sued, you would be sued,

387
00:18:12,959 --> 00:18:14,570
hell, maybe even
I would be sued.

388
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:17,278
Now get this man a
chest tube, and Grey,

389
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:18,812
get the hell outta here.

390
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:27,371
Pulse is not good. His
breath sounds are shallow.

391
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,680
His name's Nicky Hoffman.

392
00:18:33,329 --> 00:18:34,973
Pulse is minimal
on this side, too.

393
00:18:34,997 --> 00:18:37,509
Come on, Nicky. I need
you to do better than this.

394
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:38,799
Thready pulses,

395
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:41,201
multiple rib fractures with
decreased respirations...

396
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:42,414
His body's shutting down.

397
00:18:42,438 --> 00:18:43,678
Could be compartment syndrome.

398
00:18:43,739 --> 00:18:46,384
That could be why his radial
pulses are so decreased.

399
00:18:46,408 --> 00:18:48,871
We need to do bilateral
fasciotomies and relieve the pressure.

400
00:18:48,895 --> 00:18:50,277
Do we have a scalpel?

401
00:18:52,264 --> 00:18:53,864
Push 5 of morphine. Got it.

402
00:18:56,286 --> 00:18:57,286
Okay.

403
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,588
All right.

404
00:19:01,657 --> 00:19:02,897
Okay, you do the fasciotomies.

405
00:19:04,327 --> 00:19:05,327
You're the fifth year.

406
00:19:07,596 --> 00:19:08,612
All right.

407
00:19:14,871 --> 00:19:16,069
Okay.

408
00:19:16,138 --> 00:19:17,416
Okay, his pulse is stronger now.

409
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,680
Good. Do the other one.

410
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:20,691
Sponge.

411
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,226
Here you go. Thank you.

412
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:35,756
Nice job. You got this?

413
00:19:35,825 --> 00:19:36,890
Yeah. All right.

414
00:19:39,312 --> 00:19:40,811
Hey, Nicky. I'm Alex.

415
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,195
I'm a doctor.

416
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:43,530
You had a pretty bad accident.

417
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:50,888
We need a Gunther.

418
00:19:50,956 --> 00:19:52,868
Dr. Bailey, it's the
first day of fifth year. I...

419
00:19:52,892 --> 00:19:54,836
And they're at each other's
throats. We need a Gunther.

420
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,477
I've got more pressing problems.

421
00:19:56,545 --> 00:19:59,045
I'm trying to find a new
spot for Meredith Grey.

422
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:00,614
You know, I heard
they have a new

423
00:20:00,683 --> 00:20:02,366
Research Fellowship at Mass Gen.

424
00:20:02,435 --> 00:20:04,235
I thought a recommendation
from you might...

425
00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:07,398
You want me to write a
recommendation for Meredith Grey?

426
00:20:07,422 --> 00:20:09,423
By the end of the
day would be fine.

427
00:20:09,492 --> 00:20:11,508
"To whom it may concern,

428
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:13,855
"Meredith Grey is
an excellent example

429
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:17,130
"of the kind of resident you
absolutely should not hire.

430
00:20:17,199 --> 00:20:20,378
"She undermines
groundbreaking clinical trials,

431
00:20:20,402 --> 00:20:23,198
"she has absolutely no
respect for rules, authority,

432
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,605
"or, as it turns out,

433
00:20:24,674 --> 00:20:27,074
"the oath that she took
when she became a doctor.

434
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:29,860
"She will most likely
tarnish the reputation

435
00:20:29,928 --> 00:20:32,446
"of you, your doctors,
and your hospital.

436
00:20:32,515 --> 00:20:34,635
"Sincerely, Dr. Miranda Bailey."

437
00:20:35,985 --> 00:20:38,485
Meredith Grey is the
reason we need a Gunther.

438
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,526
Jerry Hoffman.

439
00:20:45,594 --> 00:20:48,512
CT showed a traumatic
subarachnoid hemorrhage.

440
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:50,398
I cleaned and splinted
his humerus fracture

441
00:20:50,466 --> 00:20:52,600
and sutured his
facial lacerations.

442
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:54,401
Well, he won't need surgery,

443
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:56,265
but let's do a neuro exam
every two hours just to make sure.

444
00:20:56,289 --> 00:20:58,089
Let's take a look
at your handiwork.

445
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:01,141
Oh, dear God.

446
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:03,522
My grandmother could sew up
a stuffed turkey better than this.

447
00:21:03,546 --> 00:21:04,546
It was

448
00:21:04,614 --> 00:21:06,213
pretty jagged in there, so...

449
00:21:06,299 --> 00:21:07,939
You ever heard of
burying your stitches?

450
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,134
All right. So I will fix it.

451
00:21:11,737 --> 00:21:13,304
Oh, Jackson.

452
00:21:13,372 --> 00:21:15,049
There's a new patient in
bed three. Kinda busy, April.

453
00:21:15,073 --> 00:21:16,568
Yeah, kinda busy turning
this guy into Frankenstein.

454
00:21:16,592 --> 00:21:19,693
Go. Go. Make yourself useful.

455
00:21:19,762 --> 00:21:21,922
All right, I'm gonna
fix this. Mmm-hmm.

456
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,844
Don't you think you're
being a little hard on the kid?

457
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:27,167
He's a lightweight.

458
00:21:27,236 --> 00:21:28,769
Be thankful you have Meredith.

459
00:21:30,239 --> 00:21:31,505
She was fired.

460
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:35,559
She okay?

461
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:38,529
I don't know.

462
00:21:39,782 --> 00:21:41,022
Mr. Hoffman?

463
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:42,794
Dr. Shepherd.

464
00:21:42,818 --> 00:21:44,618
You're at Seattle
Grace Hospital.

465
00:21:44,687 --> 00:21:47,127
There was an accident.
A sinkhole collapsed.

466
00:21:47,407 --> 00:21:48,638
My son?

467
00:21:48,707 --> 00:21:50,207
Nicky's on his way in.

468
00:21:50,276 --> 00:21:52,554
He's had some severe injuries
that they need me to assess,

469
00:21:52,578 --> 00:21:55,818
but I promise you, I'm gonna
take good care of your son.

470
00:21:55,998 --> 00:21:57,731
Nicky Hoffman,
sustained crush injuries

471
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,027
and was very
unstable in the field.

472
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:00,395
Robbins is holding
a trauma room.

473
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:01,697
We called Shepherd
from the field.

474
00:22:01,721 --> 00:22:03,601
Which one are they in? Um...

475
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:07,659
Oh, God. I don't know.

476
00:22:07,727 --> 00:22:08,942
Well, find out.

477
00:22:09,011 --> 00:22:11,545
Well, it's supposed
to be on the board.

478
00:22:11,613 --> 00:22:15,053
People, I need you to make
sure you're updating these boards.

479
00:22:17,353 --> 00:22:20,170
April, I need you to
reassign these cases.

480
00:22:20,239 --> 00:22:22,272
Uh, Yang, take over
Meredith's cases.

481
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:24,208
No.

482
00:22:24,277 --> 00:22:25,804
Cristina. I'm with Altman.

483
00:22:25,828 --> 00:22:27,544
And Meredith should
keep her cases.

484
00:22:27,613 --> 00:22:30,264
I am your Chief Resident.
You have to do what I say.

485
00:22:30,332 --> 00:22:31,810
April, it's fine.

486
00:22:31,834 --> 00:22:34,194
I can wait. Just sign them
when you have a minute.

487
00:22:37,656 --> 00:22:38,683
You're just gonna give up?

488
00:22:38,707 --> 00:22:39,785
I was fired.

489
00:22:39,809 --> 00:22:41,242
So what are you
gonna do about it?

490
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:42,670
You have to go
talk to the board.

491
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:44,044
The board fired me.

492
00:22:44,747 --> 00:22:45,879
Yang.

493
00:22:47,282 --> 00:22:48,532
What are you doing?

494
00:22:51,237 --> 00:22:53,437
I presented as thirsty, so...

495
00:22:53,505 --> 00:22:55,550
Treated the symptoms
with eight ounces of water.

496
00:22:55,574 --> 00:22:56,974
Now that I'm finished,

497
00:22:57,043 --> 00:22:58,670
I will place this bottle
in the recycling bin

498
00:22:58,694 --> 00:23:03,147
so as to avoid excess
strain on Seattle's landfills.

499
00:23:03,216 --> 00:23:05,983
That's funny.
You're a funny girl.

500
00:23:06,919 --> 00:23:08,552
Come on. We have patients.

501
00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:12,923
You need a plan.
Come up with a plan.

502
00:23:20,783 --> 00:23:22,916
<i>Okay, now pour
on that brown soap.</i>

503
00:23:33,178 --> 00:23:34,745
And pick up the
thin silver knife.

504
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,185
Good.

505
00:23:43,389 --> 00:23:45,188
Okay, now here's the thing.

506
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:47,686
You're gonna have to
really put your weight into it.

507
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:49,542
Try for smooth cuts, okay?

508
00:23:49,611 --> 00:23:51,511
Okay.

509
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:53,825
<i>Now you see that area
just below the tourniquet?</i>

510
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:55,293
<i>That's where you're gonna cut.</i>

511
00:23:55,317 --> 00:23:57,951
<i>Do it horizontally,
as deep as you can.</i>

512
00:24:03,159 --> 00:24:04,658
<i>Are you...</i>

513
00:24:04,726 --> 00:24:06,972
<i>Are you sure she's not
gonna feel anything?</i>

514
00:24:06,996 --> 00:24:09,530
No, she's unconscious,
Danny. She won't feel a thing.

515
00:24:12,001 --> 00:24:13,233
<i>Okay.</i>

516
00:24:22,128 --> 00:24:23,259
<i>I can't.</i>

517
00:24:23,729 --> 00:24:25,379
Danny...

518
00:24:25,448 --> 00:24:28,899
<i>Take that blue towel
and cover her face.</i>

519
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:30,088
<i>It'll help.</i>

520
00:24:50,439 --> 00:24:53,268
All right, now remember to
put your weight behind it, okay?

521
00:24:53,292 --> 00:24:54,532
Here we go.

522
00:24:56,228 --> 00:24:57,468
<i>One...</i>

523
00:24:59,165 --> 00:25:00,246
Two...

524
00:25:02,251 --> 00:25:03,616
<i>Three.</i>

525
00:25:03,685 --> 00:25:05,268
Oh, God!

526
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:06,653
<i>Oh, God!</i>

527
00:25:06,722 --> 00:25:07,738
Oh, God!

528
00:25:13,412 --> 00:25:16,446
<i>I hit bone. I think I hit bone.</i>

529
00:25:16,516 --> 00:25:17,659
That's good. That's good.

530
00:25:17,683 --> 00:25:19,461
Okay, put the scalpel down now.

531
00:25:19,485 --> 00:25:21,218
Now take the curved clamp

532
00:25:21,287 --> 00:25:23,407
and move it back and
forth beneath the bone.

533
00:25:32,181 --> 00:25:34,564
<i>God. God, I can't... It won't...</i>

534
00:25:34,633 --> 00:25:36,793
Put your hand in the
incision to get more traction.

535
00:25:41,006 --> 00:25:42,072
I can't.

536
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:43,719
Danny, I know this is hard,

537
00:25:43,743 --> 00:25:45,270
but we need to create more space

538
00:25:45,294 --> 00:25:46,805
so you'll be able to
saw through her bone.

539
00:25:46,829 --> 00:25:49,312
<i>No, but... No, I can't.</i>

540
00:25:49,382 --> 00:25:51,515
Okay? This is
my wife. All right?

541
00:25:51,584 --> 00:25:53,683
<i>I'm gonna kill her.
She's bleeding now...</i>

542
00:25:53,752 --> 00:25:55,135
Danny, you can't stop.

543
00:25:55,204 --> 00:25:56,631
<i>No, you need to come
down here. I can't do this.</i>

544
00:25:56,655 --> 00:25:57,955
I won't do this!

545
00:25:58,023 --> 00:25:59,267
I'm going down. No.

546
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:00,568
Dr. Hunt, I can't let
you go down there.

547
00:26:00,592 --> 00:26:02,358
He can't do it. Yes, he can.

548
00:26:02,428 --> 00:26:04,611
He can't. We are
asking too much.

549
00:26:04,679 --> 00:26:06,525
I'm going. If it starts
to go, I'm bringing you...

550
00:26:06,549 --> 00:26:08,632
I should go. I'm the
orthopedic surgeon.

551
00:26:08,701 --> 00:26:10,967
You have a wife and a child.

552
00:26:11,803 --> 00:26:13,203
I'm going.

553
00:26:14,473 --> 00:26:16,473
You're breaking up.
Can you repeat that?

554
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:23,030
Hey!

555
00:26:23,632 --> 00:26:24,632
What?

556
00:26:24,699 --> 00:26:26,599
I have a plan. Okay.

557
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:27,934
I'm gonna be a mom.

558
00:26:30,506 --> 00:26:33,540
Okay. Mer, there's a giant
sinkhole. Teddy is all over me.

559
00:26:33,609 --> 00:26:35,676
Don't page me 911
unless you have a serious...

560
00:26:35,745 --> 00:26:37,094
This is serious.

561
00:26:38,647 --> 00:26:40,925
Maybe getting fired
was a good thing.

562
00:26:40,949 --> 00:26:43,194
What do cheerful people say
when something crappy happens

563
00:26:43,218 --> 00:26:45,819
and they make it sound
like it wasn't crappy?

564
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:46,920
A blessing in disguise?

565
00:26:46,989 --> 00:26:49,270
Yeah. Maybe that's what this is.

566
00:26:50,625 --> 00:26:51,719
This is that.

567
00:26:51,743 --> 00:26:53,744
And I can...

568
00:26:53,812 --> 00:26:57,948
Make jam and drive car
pool and have playgroups.

569
00:26:58,017 --> 00:26:59,616
And maybe that's enough.

570
00:26:59,685 --> 00:27:02,335
And maybe I'll be a great mom.

571
00:27:02,405 --> 00:27:04,671
Okay. Okay. I'm gonna go vomit.

572
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:06,106
Call me when
Meredith comes back.

573
00:27:06,175 --> 00:27:07,618
And maybe you
want to be a mom, too,

574
00:27:07,642 --> 00:27:09,923
and that's why you
can't go through with it.

575
00:27:16,368 --> 00:27:17,901
I wish I wanted a kid.

576
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:21,505
I wish I wanted one so bad,
'cause then this would be easy.

577
00:27:21,573 --> 00:27:23,123
I would be happy.

578
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:26,076
I'd have Owen, and my
life wouldn't be a mess.

579
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:27,528
But I don't.

580
00:27:30,216 --> 00:27:32,149
I don't want a kid.

581
00:27:32,217 --> 00:27:34,713
I mean, I don't want to make
jam. I don't want to car pool.

582
00:27:34,737 --> 00:27:36,870
I really, really, really
don't want to be a mother.

583
00:27:36,939 --> 00:27:38,822
I want to be a
surgeon, and please...

584
00:27:38,891 --> 00:27:40,623
Get it.

585
00:27:40,692 --> 00:27:42,359
I need someone to get it.

586
00:27:42,427 --> 00:27:44,361
And I wish that
someone was Owen.

587
00:27:44,429 --> 00:27:46,396
I wish that that at any minute,

588
00:27:46,465 --> 00:27:47,947
he'll get it and show up for me,

589
00:27:48,016 --> 00:27:49,176
but that's not gonna happen.

590
00:27:50,302 --> 00:27:52,619
And you're my person.

591
00:27:52,705 --> 00:27:56,539
I need you to be there at
6:00 tonight to hold my hand,

592
00:27:56,608 --> 00:27:58,608
'cause I am scared, Mer,

593
00:27:59,645 --> 00:28:00,911
and sad,

594
00:28:02,081 --> 00:28:04,314
'cause my husband
doesn't get that.

595
00:28:04,383 --> 00:28:05,849
So I need you to.

596
00:28:14,676 --> 00:28:15,976
I am a terrible person.

597
00:28:16,044 --> 00:28:17,510
I know. Awful.

598
00:28:17,579 --> 00:28:18,990
I got Meredith's surgeries.

599
00:28:19,014 --> 00:28:22,048
I'm reaping joy from the
fact that my sister got fired.

600
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:25,637
A terrible person wouldn't feel
terrible about reaping the joy.

601
00:28:26,272 --> 00:28:27,537
Jackson, Jackson!

602
00:28:27,606 --> 00:28:29,233
I need you to take over
on a couple of these.

603
00:28:29,257 --> 00:28:31,742
I can't. I have to see a man
about redoing some sutures.

604
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:32,992
Please.

605
00:28:37,083 --> 00:28:38,142
I'll take one.

606
00:28:38,166 --> 00:28:39,366
Thank you. Bed four.

607
00:28:40,819 --> 00:28:43,197
Bailey needs her spleen
patient taken to the OR.

608
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:46,272
Uh... He's in bed three. So...

609
00:28:46,341 --> 00:28:48,808
He just... He needs
a consent form.

610
00:28:48,877 --> 00:28:50,905
Make sure that the consent
form gets put on his chart.

611
00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:51,929
Right.

612
00:28:59,722 --> 00:29:01,555
Zola, peekaboo.

613
00:29:03,525 --> 00:29:04,791
Peekaboo.

614
00:29:06,495 --> 00:29:07,615
Hi, Janet.

615
00:29:07,663 --> 00:29:08,846
Hey, Meredith.

616
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:10,391
I'm just finishing
up your home study,

617
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:12,110
and I thought I'd check
and see how Zola's doing.

618
00:29:12,134 --> 00:29:13,700
She is doing great.

619
00:29:13,769 --> 00:29:15,886
I heard about the
sinkhole on the radio.

620
00:29:15,954 --> 00:29:17,487
I figured you'd be busy today.

621
00:29:17,555 --> 00:29:19,923
Yeah, I'm just in
between surgeries.

622
00:29:19,991 --> 00:29:22,626
So... How are things going?

623
00:29:22,694 --> 00:29:24,094
Is she sleeping
through the night?

624
00:29:25,114 --> 00:29:27,347
Um. No, not really.

625
00:29:27,416 --> 00:29:29,800
She's up a few times.
But it's fine. I don't mind.

626
00:29:29,868 --> 00:29:31,897
Just you, or are you
guys taking turns?

627
00:29:31,921 --> 00:29:34,755
No, he's great with her.
Derek's great with her.

628
00:29:34,823 --> 00:29:37,285
Dr. Grey, are you
taking Zola home now?

629
00:29:37,309 --> 00:29:40,571
Because it says here that
Dr. Shepherd's got her tonight.

630
00:29:40,595 --> 00:29:43,279
Wait. I don't understand.
You two aren't together?

631
00:29:43,348 --> 00:29:46,483
No. We are. We take turns
dropping her off and picking her up.

632
00:29:46,551 --> 00:29:50,970
I'm not taking her home.
I just came to say hi.

633
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:53,390
I actually should
get back to work.

634
00:29:53,459 --> 00:29:55,442
Okay, Zola. I'm gonna go.

635
00:29:55,527 --> 00:29:56,727
Okay.

636
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:57,922
It was nice to see you, Janet.

637
00:29:57,946 --> 00:29:58,978
You, too, Meredith.

638
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:06,770
How's Nicky doing?

639
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:08,617
I gotta do my final exploration,

640
00:30:08,641 --> 00:30:10,901
check for any missed
bleeders, and then I'm out.

641
00:30:10,925 --> 00:30:12,592
The kid had a renal
artery thrombosis.

642
00:30:12,661 --> 00:30:14,021
I thought his
kidney was a goner,

643
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:16,296
but Alex did an interposition
graft and saved it.

644
00:30:16,365 --> 00:30:17,781
He's doing an amazing job.

645
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:19,427
I need to stabilize
his spinal fracture.

646
00:30:19,451 --> 00:30:20,712
So what do you got,
about another hour or so?

647
00:30:20,736 --> 00:30:22,246
Well, with the rock star
over here, you never know.

648
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:24,588
I'd keep your pager close by.

649
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:26,518
Dr. Shepherd. Mmm-hmm.

650
00:30:26,542 --> 00:30:28,336
Janet Meyers with social
services needs to speak with you.

651
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,426
Oh, now what?

652
00:30:29,495 --> 00:30:30,735
She's waiting in the lobby.

653
00:30:32,631 --> 00:30:35,465
I heard about
Meredith. I'm sorry.

654
00:30:35,534 --> 00:30:36,933
But you know, Meredith's strong,

655
00:30:37,002 --> 00:30:38,379
you're strong.
You're gonna make it.

656
00:30:38,403 --> 00:30:39,530
Could you guys
just keep it down?

657
00:30:39,554 --> 00:30:42,288
I'm trying to
concentrate. Please.

658
00:30:42,357 --> 00:30:45,037
All right. Just page me
when you're ready, okay?

659
00:30:57,139 --> 00:30:58,604
I'm... I'm sorry.

660
00:30:58,673 --> 00:31:00,051
I'm sorry. Danny?

661
00:31:00,075 --> 00:31:02,074
I'm sorry. Danny, look at me.

662
00:31:02,143 --> 00:31:03,383
You're doing great.

663
00:31:04,262 --> 00:31:05,382
Now I need you...

664
00:31:06,965 --> 00:31:09,166
I need you to cover her head.

665
00:31:09,234 --> 00:31:11,735
Keep her head safe, all right?

666
00:31:15,807 --> 00:31:16,857
All right.

667
00:31:20,162 --> 00:31:22,073
I Couldn't do it. I couldn't...

668
00:31:22,097 --> 00:31:24,743
I couldn't do it. I
couldn't. Danny, you did it.

669
00:31:24,767 --> 00:31:27,033
You did the hard
part. All right?

670
00:31:27,803 --> 00:31:29,735
Now, Danny...

671
00:31:29,804 --> 00:31:31,404
Danny, look away.

672
00:31:40,582 --> 00:31:44,017
All right, she's free. Good job.

673
00:31:44,085 --> 00:31:46,114
I'm gonna finish up, and
we'll both be right behind you.

674
00:31:46,138 --> 00:31:47,138
All right?

675
00:31:51,043 --> 00:31:52,308
<i>Take him up.</i>

676
00:32:16,468 --> 00:32:18,268
Meredith, what'd
you say to Janet?

677
00:32:19,271 --> 00:32:20,604
Nothing. Why?

678
00:32:20,672 --> 00:32:22,183
I just finished answering
a whole slew of questions

679
00:32:22,207 --> 00:32:24,357
about Zola's sleeping
arrangements.

680
00:32:24,426 --> 00:32:26,755
She's finishing her home
study. That's routine.

681
00:32:26,779 --> 00:32:28,389
Okay, there was nothing
routine when she said

682
00:32:28,413 --> 00:32:30,780
that there were
inconsistencies with our stories.

683
00:32:30,849 --> 00:32:32,415
What did she say?

684
00:32:32,484 --> 00:32:35,651
She said that she spoke to you
and that some red flags went up.

685
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,982
Well, I did see her earlier,
but I didn't say anything.

686
00:32:39,124 --> 00:32:40,723
I gotta go. I got a surgery.

687
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:42,053
Well, I'll talk to
Janet and I'll...

688
00:32:42,077 --> 00:32:43,860
No. Don't.

689
00:32:43,929 --> 00:32:45,907
Don't do anything. Don't talk
to her. I will talk care of this.

690
00:32:45,931 --> 00:32:47,811
You've already...
Don't talk to her.

691
00:32:49,734 --> 00:32:51,780
Dr. Sloan, I think you're
gonna be really impressed

692
00:32:51,804 --> 00:32:53,884
by the buried
sutures I did here.

693
00:32:54,105 --> 00:32:55,105
After you.

694
00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:01,011
That is impressive. It is.

695
00:33:01,846 --> 00:33:02,886
Gender reassignment, huh?

696
00:33:02,914 --> 00:33:04,214
Yeah.

697
00:33:04,282 --> 00:33:05,677
Normally they don't
teach that till next year.

698
00:33:05,701 --> 00:33:07,195
That's a mistake. This is not...

699
00:33:07,219 --> 00:33:09,080
Call me when you
find the right patient.

700
00:33:09,104 --> 00:33:11,020
I don't have time for this.

701
00:33:11,089 --> 00:33:13,022
Hey, I need you
to prep trauma one.

702
00:33:13,091 --> 00:33:14,435
We got another sinkhole
victim on the way.

703
00:33:14,459 --> 00:33:16,304
Stop asking me to do
your work. Do it yourself.

704
00:33:16,328 --> 00:33:17,438
And how about you tell me where

705
00:33:17,462 --> 00:33:18,606
Jerry Hoffman is? Jerry Hoffman?

706
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:21,030
Um. Well, he's supposed
to be in bed one.

707
00:33:21,099 --> 00:33:22,177
That's what the board says.

708
00:33:22,201 --> 00:33:23,667
He's not there?

709
00:33:23,735 --> 00:33:25,975
Does it look like he's there?

710
00:33:26,471 --> 00:33:28,422
Oh, wait. Wait.
That can't be right.

711
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:30,368
'Cause if the patient
from bed two is in bed one,

712
00:33:30,392 --> 00:33:32,552
then that means the patient
from bed three must be...

713
00:33:34,062 --> 00:33:35,194
Oh, no.

714
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:36,880
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

715
00:33:37,883 --> 00:33:39,461
The patient is
Mr. Chuck Wallace.

716
00:33:39,485 --> 00:33:41,095
He's having a
splenectomy secondary

717
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:42,664
to injuries sustained
in the sinkhole.

718
00:33:42,688 --> 00:33:45,889
Yes, Dr. Grey, let's move on
before my patient bleeds out.

719
00:33:45,957 --> 00:33:47,202
Okay, I'm almost
ready, Dr. Bailey.

720
00:33:47,226 --> 00:33:48,619
I just have to have the nurse

721
00:33:48,643 --> 00:33:51,083
show me the consent
form as part of the checklist.

722
00:33:51,396 --> 00:33:52,495
Scalpel.

723
00:33:56,535 --> 00:33:57,800
Wait a second.

724
00:33:57,853 --> 00:33:59,330
Dr. Grey, you're
sterile. What are you...

725
00:33:59,354 --> 00:34:00,898
Okay, hold on.
Wait a minute. I'm...

726
00:34:00,922 --> 00:34:04,357
I think that there...
Something might be... Off.

727
00:34:04,425 --> 00:34:07,560
I'm thinking that
maybe this is...

728
00:34:07,629 --> 00:34:08,709
Not our patient.

729
00:34:10,198 --> 00:34:12,165
Then whose patient is it?

730
00:34:12,234 --> 00:34:14,200
I Don't know. I just...

731
00:34:14,269 --> 00:34:17,320
You don't know? I'm
holding a scalpel in my hand.

732
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:19,189
I think you had better find out.

733
00:34:19,224 --> 00:34:21,191
Stop! Don't cut!

734
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:22,792
It's the wrong patient.

735
00:34:22,861 --> 00:34:25,145
That's Mr. Jarvis, who
needs a lung resection,

736
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:27,270
not Mr. Wallace with
a splenic hemorrhage.

737
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:29,299
I'm sorry.

738
00:34:29,368 --> 00:34:31,801
I am so, so sorry.

739
00:34:39,778 --> 00:34:43,046
Would you make sure this gets
to the medical staff office, please?

740
00:34:43,115 --> 00:34:44,355
Yes, Doctor.

741
00:34:48,470 --> 00:34:49,736
Meredith.

742
00:34:50,572 --> 00:34:51,587
What?

743
00:34:53,908 --> 00:34:55,425
Nothing.

744
00:34:55,494 --> 00:34:57,694
Grey, we've got a guy
with severe crush injuries,

745
00:34:57,763 --> 00:34:59,796
and Callie's come in
with a field amputation.

746
00:34:59,865 --> 00:35:01,242
Let's move. We gotta get
these trauma rooms ready...

747
00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:02,466
I got fired.

748
00:35:02,501 --> 00:35:04,668
Okay? I got fired.

749
00:35:04,736 --> 00:35:05,818
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

750
00:35:05,887 --> 00:35:07,504
Yeah, well, now you know.

751
00:35:08,656 --> 00:35:10,490
I have to go. I have a...

752
00:35:10,992 --> 00:35:12,225
Owen.

753
00:35:14,346 --> 00:35:16,346
She didn't have the abortion.

754
00:35:16,414 --> 00:35:18,392
She wants to and she
can't do it because of you,

755
00:35:18,416 --> 00:35:19,916
because she loves you.

756
00:35:19,985 --> 00:35:23,586
And instead of loving
her, you're punishing her.

757
00:35:23,655 --> 00:35:25,472
For what?

758
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:26,951
For being the woman
that you fell in love with?

759
00:35:26,975 --> 00:35:28,353
This isn't any of
your business. Okay,

760
00:35:28,377 --> 00:35:30,321
do you know what
will happen to Cristina

761
00:35:30,345 --> 00:35:32,090
if she has a kid that
she doesn't want?

762
00:35:32,114 --> 00:35:34,347
It will almost kill her.

763
00:35:34,415 --> 00:35:36,977
Trying to pretend that she loves a
kid as much as she loves surgery

764
00:35:37,001 --> 00:35:38,241
will almost kill her,

765
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:40,670
and it'll almost kill your kid.

766
00:35:40,989 --> 00:35:42,333
Do you know what
it's like to be raised

767
00:35:42,357 --> 00:35:44,001
by someone who didn't want you?

768
00:35:44,025 --> 00:35:45,675
I do.

769
00:35:45,744 --> 00:35:47,822
To know you stood in the
way of your mother's career?

770
00:35:47,846 --> 00:35:49,178
I do.

771
00:35:49,247 --> 00:35:52,415
I was raised by a Cristina.
My mother was a Cristina.

772
00:35:54,219 --> 00:35:55,763
And as the child
she didn't want,

773
00:35:55,787 --> 00:35:58,722
I am telling you,
don't do this to her,

774
00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:02,291
because she's kind and she
cares and she won't make it.

775
00:36:02,361 --> 00:36:05,628
The guilt of resenting her
own kid will eat her alive.

776
00:36:07,098 --> 00:36:08,378
All right. Coming through.

777
00:36:17,776 --> 00:36:21,461
No one was updating the board
even though I kept telling them to.

778
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:24,208
I know, I know. I have to
make people listen to me.

779
00:36:24,232 --> 00:36:27,011
But in all fairness, I've been
Chief Resident for 12 hours,

780
00:36:27,035 --> 00:36:30,870
and yes, a man could've lost
his his perfectly good spleen,

781
00:36:30,939 --> 00:36:32,305
but he didn't

782
00:36:32,373 --> 00:36:34,733
because of a checklist
that I implemented.

783
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:37,894
Not that that excuses
what happened.

784
00:36:37,963 --> 00:36:39,043
I...

785
00:36:39,948 --> 00:36:40,963
You...

786
00:36:41,033 --> 00:36:42,732
It's okay. Just yell at me.

787
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,167
I can take it.

788
00:36:44,236 --> 00:36:45,285
Uh...

789
00:36:46,321 --> 00:36:47,521
It's okay.

790
00:36:54,829 --> 00:36:56,580
No. I can take it.

791
00:36:56,648 --> 00:36:59,298
Really. I swear,
I can take it. I...

792
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:03,359
How deep are you
placing the tube?

793
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:07,973
21 centimeters exactly.

794
00:37:08,042 --> 00:37:09,275
Hallelujah, I'm in.

795
00:37:11,329 --> 00:37:12,896
Great.

796
00:37:12,964 --> 00:37:15,531
Now explain why you chose
that size endotracheal tube.

797
00:37:17,035 --> 00:37:18,713
Because I'm in my
fifth year of residency

798
00:37:18,737 --> 00:37:21,432
and I know what size tube
to use for a basic intubation.

799
00:37:21,456 --> 00:37:23,167
Why are you treating
me like a first year?

800
00:37:23,191 --> 00:37:24,557
Because no one ever did.

801
00:37:25,944 --> 00:37:27,144
I bet your first year,

802
00:37:27,212 --> 00:37:30,146
you could do things
better than most third years.

803
00:37:30,215 --> 00:37:32,126
Well, yes, I could. Why
are you punishing me for it?

804
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:33,967
I'm happy.

805
00:37:34,035 --> 00:37:36,536
That makes me
see you differently.

806
00:37:36,605 --> 00:37:37,815
Your arrogance
is not your fault.

807
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:41,273
You're arrogant
because you're so good.

808
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:43,337
People let you
slide by, skip steps.

809
00:37:43,361 --> 00:37:46,429
They gave you the hard stuff
but let you skip the easy stuff.

810
00:37:46,498 --> 00:37:48,142
I have no doubt
that you can tell me

811
00:37:48,166 --> 00:37:49,777
how to do a coronary
artery bypass.

812
00:37:49,801 --> 00:37:52,084
But I'm not sure
that you can tell me

813
00:37:52,153 --> 00:37:55,104
why you chose that
size endotracheal tube.

814
00:38:02,397 --> 00:38:03,879
Look, I know what you heard,

815
00:38:03,949 --> 00:38:06,429
but Meredith Grey is
one of the most qualified...

816
00:38:08,053 --> 00:38:09,953
Yeah, I understand.

817
00:38:10,021 --> 00:38:12,381
Yeah. Thank you for your time.

818
00:38:14,743 --> 00:38:16,487
Not now, Karev. I'm in no mood.

819
00:38:16,511 --> 00:38:18,227
You need to get
Meredith her job back.

820
00:38:18,297 --> 00:38:19,874
What do you think
I've been doing?

821
00:38:19,898 --> 00:38:21,476
I've spent the whole
morning trying to get her a job.

822
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:23,132
Meredith doesn't need a job.

823
00:38:23,201 --> 00:38:24,562
She needs this job.
It's not gonna happen.

824
00:38:24,586 --> 00:38:25,963
The board's already
made their decision.

825
00:38:25,987 --> 00:38:27,219
Let me talk to them.

826
00:38:27,288 --> 00:38:29,139
I mean, maybe I
don't know what I saw.

827
00:38:29,207 --> 00:38:31,423
Maybe I lied to get
the Chief Resident...

828
00:38:31,492 --> 00:38:32,587
I can't let you say that.

829
00:38:32,611 --> 00:38:33,611
Oh, the hell you can't.

830
00:38:37,933 --> 00:38:39,173
Karev, this is not on you.

831
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:44,187
Yeah, it is.

832
00:38:44,255 --> 00:38:45,421
It's all on me.

833
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,844
Looks perfect, Jerry.

834
00:38:50,912 --> 00:38:52,478
Second time's the charm.

835
00:38:54,282 --> 00:38:56,015
Sutures look a lot better.

836
00:38:56,084 --> 00:38:57,367
Really?

837
00:38:57,435 --> 00:39:00,719
That's great. No. No,
no. Not great. Better.

838
00:39:00,789 --> 00:39:04,051
Which isn't saying much considering
the crappy job you did the first time.

839
00:39:04,075 --> 00:39:05,775
You just said it
looked a lot better.

840
00:39:05,844 --> 00:39:08,327
This guy just fell
into a sinkhole,

841
00:39:08,396 --> 00:39:09,829
his kid's in surgery,

842
00:39:10,498 --> 00:39:12,248
and now he's got a scar

843
00:39:12,317 --> 00:39:14,912
to remind him of this terrible
day for the rest of his life.

844
00:39:14,936 --> 00:39:17,487
You want to go tell
him that, big shot?

845
00:39:18,156 --> 00:39:19,316
Go ahead.

846
00:39:19,891 --> 00:39:21,157
Dr. Sloan.

847
00:39:22,394 --> 00:39:23,927
Is Nicky out of surgery?

848
00:39:23,995 --> 00:39:26,315
Dr. Avery was just
about to go check on that.

849
00:39:29,601 --> 00:39:30,767
Um...

850
00:39:35,473 --> 00:39:37,907
Wait. Bailey paged
you, too? Any idea why?

851
00:39:37,975 --> 00:39:40,187
Who cares? As long as it
gets me away from Altman.

852
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:41,411
Oh, God.

853
00:39:41,479 --> 00:39:43,057
She's gonna fire us, isn't she?

854
00:39:43,081 --> 00:39:44,514
Why would she fire us?

855
00:39:44,583 --> 00:39:46,527
There was that patient
mix-up in the OR.

856
00:39:46,551 --> 00:39:48,585
Oh. You should be fired.

857
00:39:48,653 --> 00:39:51,688
Me? You guys didn't
update the board.

858
00:39:51,757 --> 00:39:53,406
That's why she
looks so pissed off.

859
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:58,945
That's not good for it.

860
00:40:00,699 --> 00:40:02,064
Let me see that chart.

861
00:40:02,133 --> 00:40:03,716
What is she looking for?

862
00:40:07,605 --> 00:40:09,088
What have you got?

863
00:40:09,157 --> 00:40:12,108
A field amputation with
complicated extrications.

864
00:40:12,177 --> 00:40:13,938
Still assessing her
multiple crush injuries,

865
00:40:13,962 --> 00:40:17,430
but I felt a broken pelvis for
sure, and her BP's in the toilet.

866
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:18,998
Yeah, this is a Gunther.

867
00:40:20,785 --> 00:40:22,385
Really? Really.

868
00:40:24,105 --> 00:40:25,688
Think they can handle a Gunther?

869
00:40:25,757 --> 00:40:27,877
Oh, I think they need a Gunther.

870
00:40:29,494 --> 00:40:30,760
What's a Gunther?

871
00:40:36,067 --> 00:40:38,100
Hey. I got your
message. What's up?

872
00:40:38,169 --> 00:40:40,953
We should wait till
your husband gets here.

873
00:40:41,022 --> 00:40:43,072
You paged Derek?

874
00:40:43,141 --> 00:40:44,618
Well, he's in surgery.
That could take hours.

875
00:40:44,642 --> 00:40:46,842
Can't you at least tell
me what this is about?

876
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,146
I could tell something was up

877
00:40:50,214 --> 00:40:51,974
when I ran into you
at Zola's day care.

878
00:40:52,017 --> 00:40:55,902
So I made some calls.

879
00:40:55,970 --> 00:40:59,255
It would have been better if you
told me that you had been fired

880
00:40:59,324 --> 00:41:01,269
and that you and
Dr. Shepherd were living apart.

881
00:41:01,293 --> 00:41:03,459
But I can explain...
I'm sure you can.

882
00:41:03,528 --> 00:41:05,545
But you understand my concern.

883
00:41:05,613 --> 00:41:08,114
So what happens now?
Worst-case scenario.

884
00:41:08,183 --> 00:41:09,682
Let's not even go there.

885
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:12,785
Well, they couldn't
take Zola, right?

886
00:41:12,854 --> 00:41:15,538
I'm not really comfortable
discussing this without your husband.

887
00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:18,870
Well, this is urgent, so I'll go
get him and I will be right back.

888
00:41:22,446 --> 00:41:24,246
<i>Do you have what it takes?</i>

889
00:41:29,721 --> 00:41:31,231
<i>If your marriage is in trouble,</i>

890
00:41:31,255 --> 00:41:32,622
<i>can you weather the storm?</i>

891
00:41:40,866 --> 00:41:43,065
<i>When the ground gives way,</i>

892
00:41:43,134 --> 00:41:44,850
<i>and your world collapses...</i>

893
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:48,801
He's losing his SSEPs.
Push IV steroids.

894
00:41:54,896 --> 00:41:56,890
<i>Maybe you just
need to have faith...</i>

895
00:41:56,914 --> 00:41:58,514
Scrub in. I need you.

896
00:41:58,583 --> 00:42:00,115
I just got your page.

897
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:02,384
<i>And trust that you can
survive this together.</i>

898
00:42:03,921 --> 00:42:05,999
<i>Maybe you just
need to hold on tight...</i>

899
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:07,357
What did I do?

900
00:42:08,593 --> 00:42:09,892
What did I do?

901
00:42:09,961 --> 00:42:11,193
<i>And no matter what...</i>

902
00:42:12,129 --> 00:42:13,262
What did I do?

903
00:42:14,182 --> 00:42:15,681
<i>Don't let go.</i>
