1
00:00:02,003 --> 00:00:03,268
<i>When you're a kid,</i>

2
00:00:03,337 --> 00:00:05,804
<i>you always want
things to stay the same,</i>

3
00:00:06,874 --> 00:00:09,457
<i>the same teacher, same house,</i>

4
00:00:09,543 --> 00:00:11,259
<i>same friends.</i>

5
00:00:11,345 --> 00:00:13,545
<i>Being a surgeon is no different.</i>

6
00:00:13,613 --> 00:00:15,613
<i>You get used to
the same attendings,</i>

7
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:17,966
<i>same scrub nurses,
same hospital.</i>

8
00:00:18,035 --> 00:00:19,951
Hey, Cristina.

9
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:23,772
<i>Of course, that all changes the
minute fifth year comes around.</i>

10
00:00:23,841 --> 00:00:25,106
Cristina!

11
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:27,320
Hey! Hey.

12
00:00:27,344 --> 00:00:29,912
<i>And you have to find a new job.</i>

13
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:31,747
How was Dallas? Bad.

14
00:00:31,816 --> 00:00:34,160
I can operate circles around
the head of the program.

15
00:00:34,184 --> 00:00:35,962
I'm sick of all this schlepping.

16
00:00:35,986 --> 00:00:38,432
From now on, they're
gonna have to come to me.

17
00:00:38,456 --> 00:00:39,733
How was yours? Boston, right?

18
00:00:39,757 --> 00:00:40,872
San Francisco.

19
00:00:40,941 --> 00:00:42,552
I'm supposed to leave
for Boston tonight,

20
00:00:42,576 --> 00:00:43,892
but I think I may cancel.

21
00:00:43,961 --> 00:00:45,722
What? Only an idiot
cancels the Brigham.

22
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:47,257
And didn't Bailey
set that up for you?

23
00:00:47,281 --> 00:00:48,725
No. Uh-uh. She's gonna kill you.

24
00:00:48,749 --> 00:00:49,814
How cute is she?

25
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:51,883
Hi!

26
00:00:51,952 --> 00:00:54,219
Hey, do you need
a ride, or is Owen...

27
00:00:54,288 --> 00:00:55,448
Picking me up? No.

28
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:57,155
So how'd it go? It was great.

29
00:00:57,224 --> 00:00:59,591
Hi, baby girl. Oh, my love.

30
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:01,877
Look who's here.
Mama. She missed you.

31
00:01:01,945 --> 00:01:04,658
Your idiot wife wants to cancel
her interview at the Brigham.

32
00:01:04,682 --> 00:01:06,359
No. You don't
cancel an interview

33
00:01:06,383 --> 00:01:08,478
with the best general
surgery program in the country.

34
00:01:08,502 --> 00:01:09,901
What I said.

35
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:12,049
Why would we move? You've
almost finished the house,

36
00:01:12,073 --> 00:01:13,305
and you have a job here.

37
00:01:13,374 --> 00:01:15,085
There are other homes
and jobs in Boston.

38
00:01:15,109 --> 00:01:16,836
You're going. End of discussion.

39
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,821
Good husband. Okay, let's go.

40
00:01:18,845 --> 00:01:20,357
I will ride in the
back with my girl.

41
00:01:20,381 --> 00:01:22,213
I'll get the bags.

42
00:01:30,273 --> 00:01:32,307
Here we go.

43
00:01:32,376 --> 00:01:34,909
I snagged the last croissant,

44
00:01:34,978 --> 00:01:38,196
and I only had to elbow one
orderly out of the way to get it.

45
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:40,549
I got a secret.

46
00:01:40,634 --> 00:01:41,967
Oh, really?

47
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:43,730
If I tell you, you
can't tell anybody.

48
00:01:43,754 --> 00:01:45,514
You promise? I promise.

49
00:01:46,623 --> 00:01:48,056
I'm in love.

50
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:51,025
Okay. With...

51
00:01:51,761 --> 00:01:53,161
With whom?

52
00:02:06,926 --> 00:02:08,926
This is getting ridiculous.

53
00:02:08,995 --> 00:02:10,662
The NIH?

54
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:13,365
Since when does the NIH bribe
residents to come work for them?

55
00:02:13,434 --> 00:02:16,834
Oh, they don't, except
when you're me, a God.

56
00:02:17,555 --> 00:02:19,149
Hey. Cookie's stale.

57
00:02:19,173 --> 00:02:22,791
Aw, Karev. Is this hard for
you, having to beg for interviews

58
00:02:22,859 --> 00:02:24,771
while some of us just
sit back and get wooed?

59
00:02:24,795 --> 00:02:26,472
No one is begging. Oh,
yeah, maybe you should.

60
00:02:26,496 --> 00:02:27,958
Maybe that way, you'd
actually get an interview.

61
00:02:27,982 --> 00:02:29,497
Ha! I love mean Kepner.

62
00:02:29,567 --> 00:02:31,411
I got an interview.
Oh, really, where?

63
00:02:31,435 --> 00:02:33,135
At...

64
00:02:33,203 --> 00:02:34,297
places. APRIL: Uh-huh.

65
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:36,305
Whatever! Look,
this sucks, okay.

66
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:37,884
I mean, we got boards
in a couple of weeks

67
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:39,920
and now they want us to
go on freaking job interviews?

68
00:02:39,944 --> 00:02:41,076
There's only so much crap

69
00:02:41,145 --> 00:02:42,722
a guy can have thrown
at him before he snaps.

70
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:43,857
There's a trauma
coming in on the roof.

71
00:02:43,881 --> 00:02:45,121
Kepner, Karev, come with me.

72
00:02:45,181 --> 00:02:46,792
I gotta leave for my
Northwestern interview in an hour.

73
00:02:46,816 --> 00:02:48,800
I told you yesterday. Avery?

74
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:51,035
Sloan's got me all
day, Chief. Sorry.

75
00:02:57,277 --> 00:02:58,471
I'm free. Great.

76
00:02:58,495 --> 00:02:59,828
Thank you.

77
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:04,960
Female hiker found at
the bottom of a ravine.

78
00:03:04,984 --> 00:03:07,897
Positive LOC with obvious
head and abdominal trauma,

79
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:09,866
hypothermia,
frostbite, you name it.

80
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:11,039
Let's go.

81
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:12,202
Airway looks clear.

82
00:03:12,226 --> 00:03:13,226
Weakened pulse.

83
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:19,726
I'm Dr. Grey. You're
in the hospital.

84
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,460
Can you tell us your name?

85
00:03:21,484 --> 00:03:23,546
Okay, okay. Let's
go. OWEN: Let's go.

86
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:24,585
Out of the way.

87
00:03:27,524 --> 00:03:30,642
Okay, I'm gonna be right
on the other side of that glass.

88
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:32,677
You just try to stay calm.

89
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:43,457
You weren't hiking
out there, were you?

90
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:45,652
<i>What's the holdup, Grey?</i>

91
00:03:45,676 --> 00:03:47,153
I'm staying in. Get me an apron.

92
00:03:47,177 --> 00:03:49,778
Okay. Here you go.

93
00:03:49,847 --> 00:03:51,441
Okay, I'm gonna stay with you.

94
00:03:51,465 --> 00:03:54,985
I'm not leaving. I'll be
right here the whole time.

95
00:03:56,704 --> 00:03:58,186
Displaced tibial fracture.

96
00:03:58,255 --> 00:04:00,283
Rib fractures, too.
Lungs look fine.

97
00:04:00,307 --> 00:04:01,606
How far did she fall?

98
00:04:01,675 --> 00:04:03,575
Don't know. Some
hikers found her.

99
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:05,644
What is it, Karev?

100
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:07,979
Jane Doe looks to be
around 15-years-old.

101
00:04:08,048 --> 00:04:10,093
Hunt wants you to
take a look at her.

102
00:04:10,117 --> 00:04:12,362
Hey, any word back
on my interviews?

103
00:04:12,386 --> 00:04:13,552
Yeah, I'm working on it.

104
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:14,981
The angle's off on this elbow.

105
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:16,850
You've been working on it
for a couple of weeks now.

106
00:04:16,874 --> 00:04:18,890
Well, you're an acquired
taste, like blue cheese.

107
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,136
Some people love
it and some people

108
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,321
can't stand to be in
the same room with it.

109
00:04:21,345 --> 00:04:22,410
They think it's stinky.

110
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,245
So now I'm stinky cheese?

111
00:04:24,314 --> 00:04:26,481
You can tell Hunt
this isn't a peds case.

112
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:28,430
She's an adult. The
growth plates have closed.

113
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:30,029
And tell him this elbow
was broken a while ago.

114
00:04:30,053 --> 00:04:31,319
See the curve in her forearm

115
00:04:31,388 --> 00:04:32,983
and the periosteal
reaction on her humerus?

116
00:04:33,007 --> 00:04:34,584
These are fractures
that never healed right.

117
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:35,848
Or were never treated.

118
00:04:35,892 --> 00:04:38,526
I've seen injuries
like this in Iraq

119
00:04:38,595 --> 00:04:40,635
in patients who were tortured.

120
00:04:43,534 --> 00:04:45,311
She was abused.
It's all over the x-rays.

121
00:04:45,335 --> 00:04:47,179
Okay, we have
to call the police.

122
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:49,115
Just stay calm. We don't know
anything for sure until she talks.

123
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:50,483
Hunt, she has a
temporal bone fracture.

124
00:04:50,507 --> 00:04:52,235
I'm gonna have to do a
middle fossa approach.

125
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:53,853
There's an aneurysm
in her celiac artery.

126
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:55,004
I'll need to put a graft in.

127
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:56,255
She's ready to be
put under, Chief.

128
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:57,378
Wait.

129
00:04:59,149 --> 00:05:01,933
You were running from someone,
right? Is that how you fell?

130
00:05:02,002 --> 00:05:04,402
No one's gonna hurt you. We
just need to know your name.

131
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:07,572
He called me Susan.

132
00:05:09,376 --> 00:05:11,677
But I think it's Holly.

133
00:05:26,894 --> 00:05:29,873
Beneath the purple tab you'll find
case studies from the past year.

134
00:05:29,897 --> 00:05:31,980
Under the yellow
tab, a list of programs

135
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:34,199
instituted during my
tenure as Chief Resident.

136
00:05:34,268 --> 00:05:35,800
Under the green tab...

137
00:05:35,869 --> 00:05:39,571
"Dr. Kepner's cheerful demeanor
and pleasant bedside manner

138
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,073
"made my recovery
period a true pleasure."

139
00:05:42,126 --> 00:05:43,553
Letters from former patients.

140
00:05:43,577 --> 00:05:45,910
This one's five pages.

141
00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:48,140
Just one of many
satisfied customers.

142
00:05:48,164 --> 00:05:50,193
Okay, moving on to the blue tab,

143
00:05:50,217 --> 00:05:52,233
awards and accolades.

144
00:05:52,302 --> 00:05:54,553
Yes, her name was Holly Wheeler.

145
00:05:54,605 --> 00:05:55,865
We don't know anything yet.

146
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:57,367
Let's not jump to conclusions.

147
00:05:57,391 --> 00:05:58,756
It was all over the news.

148
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:00,741
She was in the grocery
store with her mom,

149
00:06:00,811 --> 00:06:03,211
and somebody just took her.

150
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,080
It was the summer of 2000.

151
00:06:05,148 --> 00:06:06,380
So this could be her.

152
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:09,167
I mean, what, she was
probably 8 or 9 at the time?

153
00:06:09,236 --> 00:06:12,148
She was 6, and they
weren't in the supermarket,

154
00:06:12,172 --> 00:06:13,332
they were outside.

155
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,084
Her mom bumped into a friend,

156
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:18,443
started talking about the block
party they were having that weekend.

157
00:06:18,512 --> 00:06:23,498
Could she bring a salad? They
had enough dessert already.

158
00:06:23,567 --> 00:06:26,734
I mean, that's how long
it took for her to realize

159
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:29,337
that her child wasn't
there anymore.

160
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:32,673
That story runs through my head

161
00:06:32,742 --> 00:06:34,342
every time Tuck
walks out the door.

162
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:36,488
And, and yeah, we
don't know if this is her,

163
00:06:36,512 --> 00:06:40,665
so please let's just stop
talking about it and operate.

164
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:42,478
Bailey, Shepherd, can
you stop for a moment?

165
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:43,952
What is it?

166
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:46,380
The police want us to check
for a birthmark under her arm.

167
00:06:57,868 --> 00:06:59,400
The other side, further up.

168
00:07:15,552 --> 00:07:16,784
Delivery for Dr. Yang.

169
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:18,570
Thank you.

170
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:19,759
That's not for you.

171
00:07:19,822 --> 00:07:21,350
Call a cop. There's
one over there.

172
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:23,057
Who's on my jock now?

173
00:07:23,126 --> 00:07:25,677
Cleveland Clinic.
Pretty impressive.

174
00:07:26,629 --> 00:07:28,063
I'm not gonna grovel.

175
00:07:28,148 --> 00:07:30,760
You know we're as good a
program as Cleveland Clinic.

176
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:32,429
And we've got a
major stem cell project,

177
00:07:32,453 --> 00:07:34,263
one that I welcome
your input on.

178
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:35,398
And as far as teachers,

179
00:07:35,422 --> 00:07:37,522
I'm a catch.

180
00:07:37,591 --> 00:07:39,001
And I'm groveling. It's sweet.

181
00:07:39,025 --> 00:07:41,642
Come on. Let's go.

182
00:07:44,447 --> 00:07:46,447
Can you wiggle your toes?

183
00:07:49,336 --> 00:07:50,818
Painful?

184
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,849
Yeah. You hit your head
pretty hard when you fell.

185
00:07:52,873 --> 00:07:55,033
But you're doing great, okay?

186
00:07:57,761 --> 00:08:00,461
Holly, I'm Dr. Fincher.

187
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:02,814
I'm a therapist who
works for the hospital.

188
00:08:02,883 --> 00:08:05,717
Is it okay if the police
ask you a few questions?

189
00:08:05,769 --> 00:08:07,335
Only if you feel up to it.

190
00:08:17,614 --> 00:08:20,532
Do you know his name, Holly,
the man that was keeping you?

191
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:23,217
It's okay.

192
00:08:24,687 --> 00:08:26,854
Joseph. Joseph Ingles.

193
00:08:29,058 --> 00:08:31,070
That's great. Really helpful.

194
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:33,472
Now can you tell us anything
about where you were living?

195
00:08:33,496 --> 00:08:35,808
Was it a house, an apartment?

196
00:08:35,832 --> 00:08:38,066
It was a house.

197
00:08:38,134 --> 00:08:40,218
One story. It has a basement.

198
00:08:40,287 --> 00:08:41,880
Do you know if there
was any roads nearby?

199
00:08:41,904 --> 00:08:43,221
Could you hear cars?

200
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:45,407
He didn't let me go outside.

201
00:08:47,227 --> 00:08:48,893
Holly, we can
stop if you need to.

202
00:08:48,946 --> 00:08:51,045
Just let us know.

203
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:53,393
Okay, then. Maybe
we should take a break.

204
00:08:53,417 --> 00:08:54,417
Sure.

205
00:08:59,589 --> 00:09:01,634
You should've called me the
minute you talked to the police.

206
00:09:01,658 --> 00:09:04,242
She had major brain
and abdominal injuries.

207
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:06,044
My first concern
was keeping her alive.

208
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:08,975
I understand, but the protocol
is to call psych right away.

209
00:09:08,999 --> 00:09:12,000
You didn't, and now our patient
has bonded with a surgeon.

210
00:09:12,085 --> 00:09:13,468
Her name is Dr. Grey.

211
00:09:13,536 --> 00:09:16,020
Dr. Grey. Fine. That's
who Holly has chosen.

212
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:18,370
There's no breaking
that bond now.

213
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:20,391
What's going on?

214
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,972
Dr. Fincher thinks that it's
best that you stay with Holly,

215
00:09:22,996 --> 00:09:24,791
at least until her
parents arrive.

216
00:09:24,815 --> 00:09:25,925
I have no psych training.

217
00:09:25,949 --> 00:09:27,382
Holly spent the last 12 years

218
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:30,235
with little to no control
over anything in her life.

219
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:32,737
Our job is to break that
pattern by letting her know that

220
00:09:32,805 --> 00:09:34,622
she and she alone
is in control here.

221
00:09:34,691 --> 00:09:36,891
Whatever she wants, she gets,

222
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,159
including you.

223
00:09:38,227 --> 00:09:39,905
We'll have to work
together on this.

224
00:09:39,929 --> 00:09:40,979
Okay.

225
00:09:41,031 --> 00:09:42,763
Thank you. If you'll excuse me,

226
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:45,233
the family's
waiting for my call.

227
00:09:48,855 --> 00:09:50,187
What was I supposed to say,

228
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:51,701
I'm flattered that she likes me,

229
00:09:51,725 --> 00:09:53,436
but I have a really
important job interview?

230
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,504
I just wanted to ask you, did you
need me to reschedule your flight?

231
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:57,774
Yes, I can take the last flight out
tonight and get a cab from here.

232
00:09:57,798 --> 00:09:58,913
Okay.

233
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,534
Hang in there. Yeah.

234
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,186
Tough case.

235
00:10:05,255 --> 00:10:06,854
You're doing a good job.

236
00:10:06,923 --> 00:10:08,067
Except that I'm not.

237
00:10:08,091 --> 00:10:09,468
Her parents are on their way,

238
00:10:09,492 --> 00:10:11,553
and the press are
filling up the parking lot.

239
00:10:11,577 --> 00:10:13,937
I think I might be
out of my depth here.

240
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:16,631
I'll deal with the parents.

241
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,232
You call Phil in security

242
00:10:18,301 --> 00:10:19,712
and have him double
the guard presence,

243
00:10:19,736 --> 00:10:21,502
then call Heather in PR.

244
00:10:21,571 --> 00:10:23,065
And tell her to
wrangle the press.

245
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:25,389
You go home, make sure
all your suits are clean.

246
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,169
You'll need 'em for
the press conferences.

247
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:28,759
You'll be okay, Hunt.

248
00:10:35,418 --> 00:10:37,752
What is she like? Did
she speak English?

249
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:40,099
Or is it like that
Jodie-Foster-in-the-woods movie?

250
00:10:40,123 --> 00:10:42,035
English, although
she's not really speaking.

251
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:43,736
She was just flipping
through the channels.

252
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,244
I'm guessing the TV reception
in the basement wasn't that great.

253
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:49,797
Are you trying to get
out of your interview?

254
00:10:49,866 --> 00:10:51,343
The parents are on their way.

255
00:10:51,367 --> 00:10:53,162
I'm going. I want to. Really?

256
00:10:53,186 --> 00:10:55,920
'Cause it seems like
you want to stay and raise

257
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:58,167
happy cutie babies with
your happy cutie husband.

258
00:10:58,191 --> 00:10:59,836
Why are you so
fine with leaving?

259
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,192
Because I'm a surgeon,

260
00:11:01,261 --> 00:11:03,094
and I want to work
at the best hospital

261
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:04,929
with the best people,
as should you.

262
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:06,638
Since when did you
turn into such a sap?

263
00:11:06,683 --> 00:11:08,477
What do you guys know
about Carson Methodist?

264
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,218
Nothing. I'd like
to keep it that way.

265
00:11:10,287 --> 00:11:12,064
It's in Toledo. Or
an hour outside,

266
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:13,132
I guess. I interview next week.

267
00:11:13,156 --> 00:11:14,634
Where's Toledo? Canada.

268
00:11:14,658 --> 00:11:16,668
Ohio. A quarter of a
million people live there.

269
00:11:16,692 --> 00:11:17,942
But this is an hour outside.

270
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:21,112
Robbins set it up
for me. I can't not go.

271
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:23,075
I've enjoyed our time
together these past few years.

272
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:24,276
What are you doing?

273
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,778
We are officially on
different career paths.

274
00:11:25,802 --> 00:11:27,146
It's only polite
to say good-bye.

275
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:29,721
Oh, my God. Holly?

276
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:31,989
It's her.

277
00:11:32,826 --> 00:11:33,906
It's her.

278
00:11:38,965 --> 00:11:43,667
I'd know you anywhere. You
are still my perfect baby girl.

279
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:47,655
Holly, I know it's soon,
but I would like to hug you.

280
00:11:47,723 --> 00:11:49,023
Would that be okay?

281
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:04,255
Oh, my baby girl.

282
00:12:05,675 --> 00:12:07,158
My baby girl.

283
00:12:11,948 --> 00:12:13,148
Baby girl.

284
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:19,137
We're a new program,

285
00:12:19,206 --> 00:12:20,483
so you're on the verge
of something great here.

286
00:12:20,507 --> 00:12:21,650
You're lucky you're
getting in now.

287
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:22,985
Really? Oh, yeah.

288
00:12:23,009 --> 00:12:24,993
We're even about
to upgrade our NICU.

289
00:12:25,061 --> 00:12:26,739
Just waiting on the
final round of funding.

290
00:12:26,763 --> 00:12:30,181
In fact, that's why we were so
excited to get Dr. Robbins' call.

291
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,044
She told us all about that money

292
00:12:32,068 --> 00:12:33,967
you raised for
those African kids.

293
00:12:34,037 --> 00:12:35,987
Melinda, these are
the discharge papers

294
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:37,305
for the liver transplant boy.

295
00:12:37,373 --> 00:12:38,840
Could you prep
him for transport?

296
00:12:38,908 --> 00:12:40,419
You're discharging
a liver transplant?

297
00:12:40,443 --> 00:12:42,693
We're not equipped to deal
with cases that serious yet.

298
00:12:42,763 --> 00:12:45,596
So we're shipping him to
our sister hospital in Toledo.

299
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:47,515
You hungry?

300
00:12:47,584 --> 00:12:49,934
It's make-your-own-sundae
day at the cafeteria.

301
00:12:50,002 --> 00:12:51,302
You're gonna love it.

302
00:13:06,219 --> 00:13:07,301
Hey. Whoa. Sorry.

303
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:08,610
I thought you were...

304
00:13:08,637 --> 00:13:10,032
I thought you
were the kidnapper.

305
00:13:10,056 --> 00:13:12,001
No, no, I... You hear
they caught him last night?

306
00:13:12,025 --> 00:13:13,391
Yeah.

307
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:16,044
That's why I'm here,
actually. I needed more suits.

308
00:13:16,112 --> 00:13:18,062
You know, for the
press conferences.

309
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:20,298
I thought you were
studying at Meredith's.

310
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:23,350
Well, I came home
to take a shower.

311
00:13:23,419 --> 00:13:27,338
Well, I'll clear up and
I'll get out of your hair.

312
00:13:34,414 --> 00:13:37,097
You know, just
leave it. Stay here.

313
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:38,499
Oh, no, no, no, I...

314
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:40,496
No, I'm staying at
Meredith's until the boards.

315
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,760
I'm never here. So just stay.

316
00:13:45,442 --> 00:13:46,724
You sure?

317
00:13:48,295 --> 00:13:49,561
Until the boards are over.

318
00:13:51,698 --> 00:13:52,780
Okay.

319
00:13:54,918 --> 00:13:56,517
I'll go now.

320
00:13:56,586 --> 00:13:59,053
Give you some privacy.

321
00:13:59,122 --> 00:14:02,874
This is, I think, your
first day of school.

322
00:14:08,381 --> 00:14:09,947
6th birthday.

323
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:12,376
Looks like that's where
the bunny came from.

324
00:14:14,587 --> 00:14:17,021
So today Dr. Torres will
be realigning your arm.

325
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:18,934
You'll have a lot more
mobility in your elbows.

326
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:21,358
Did they really think
that this would work?

327
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:24,445
Give me some photo
albums and a stuffed animal,

328
00:14:24,514 --> 00:14:26,380
and we'd be normal again?

329
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:29,512
No, I think that they are just
trying to help you remember

330
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:31,252
because you were only 6.

331
00:14:31,321 --> 00:14:34,988
Well, then tell them
that I remember all of it,

332
00:14:36,225 --> 00:14:39,159
the first day of school
and my 6th birthday.

333
00:14:41,096 --> 00:14:42,596
Just like I remember

334
00:14:42,665 --> 00:14:45,433
the first time he made
me take my clothes off

335
00:14:45,501 --> 00:14:47,201
and how hard he kicked me

336
00:14:47,269 --> 00:14:49,703
when I didn't
act like I liked it

337
00:14:49,772 --> 00:14:52,573
or how his breath
smelled like cigarettes,

338
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:55,843
how I could've gotten
away a bunch of times.

339
00:14:55,911 --> 00:14:57,778
But every time I
made it outside,

340
00:14:57,847 --> 00:15:01,115
I could hear his
voice inside my head,

341
00:15:01,184 --> 00:15:04,986
that they didn't want me,
that I was dead to them,

342
00:15:05,055 --> 00:15:07,254
and that the only
reason I finally ran away

343
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:11,925
was because he told me that
he was gonna take another girl.

344
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:14,462
Because I was
too old and used up

345
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:16,263
and disgusting now.

346
00:15:21,738 --> 00:15:23,304
Tell them that.

347
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:29,299
We will then repair
numerous fractures

348
00:15:29,329 --> 00:15:32,646
that never healed
properly the first time.

349
00:15:32,716 --> 00:15:34,810
The patient is in good spirits,

350
00:15:34,834 --> 00:15:37,368
and we're grateful for
the chance to allow her

351
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:39,615
to heal in a way
that wasn't positive...

352
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:41,538
Pausible... Possible before.

353
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,468
We hope... Thank
you, Dr. Torres.

354
00:15:43,492 --> 00:15:45,588
How does Holly feel about
Joseph being captured?

355
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:47,506
And her parents, when
can we talk to them?

356
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:50,025
Look, I'm sure the Wheelers
would appreciate some privacy.

357
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:51,577
Is it true Holly's refusing
to speak to them?

358
00:15:51,601 --> 00:15:53,595
Where are her parents?

359
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,887
<i>It's a very
complicated situation.</i>

360
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,272
It's not complicated.
It's not complicated at all.

361
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:00,708
The guy's a monster who
stole our kid for 12 years,

362
00:16:00,777 --> 00:16:02,388
and we're the ones who
are allowed to see her

363
00:16:02,412 --> 00:16:03,656
for only one
supervised hour a day.

364
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,079
Holly's in a fragile state.

365
00:16:05,147 --> 00:16:07,225
She'll need all of us
to abide by her wishes,

366
00:16:07,249 --> 00:16:08,844
even if that means
giving her space.

367
00:16:08,868 --> 00:16:11,046
She was brainwashed by him.
She doesn't know what she wants.

368
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:14,588
Possibly. But she still has
feelings of blame and resentment

369
00:16:14,657 --> 00:16:16,040
that she has to process.

370
00:16:16,092 --> 00:16:18,052
Right now you're
still strangers to her.

371
00:16:18,094 --> 00:16:20,254
'Cause you won't let us go
in there and be her parents!

372
00:16:23,132 --> 00:16:25,616
Did you show her the photo
album? Did she remember?

373
00:16:27,687 --> 00:16:30,388
Not even the bunny?
She loved that thing.

374
00:16:30,457 --> 00:16:32,739
She didn't remember. I'm sorry.

375
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:39,546
She'll come back to you.

376
00:16:39,616 --> 00:16:43,684
It might take some time, but
the memories are still there.

377
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:46,019
You just have to be patient.

378
00:16:48,057 --> 00:16:51,475
Oh, hey, Chief. I haven't heard
back yet from Northwestern,

379
00:16:51,544 --> 00:16:53,155
and I know you're
close with Dr. Mitchell.

380
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:54,462
Have you spoken to him?

381
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:56,697
Yes, he said your
resume was impressive.

382
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:58,398
Oh, thank goodness.

383
00:16:58,468 --> 00:17:00,145
Keep your options open, though.

384
00:17:00,169 --> 00:17:02,369
What do you mean? He said
he thought I was impressive.

385
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:06,039
He also said he wasn't sure if
it was a match personality-wise.

386
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:09,309
Personality? I'm asking for
a job, not a date to the prom.

387
00:17:09,378 --> 00:17:10,956
Damn reporters.

388
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:13,347
Sorry. Hello.

389
00:17:13,415 --> 00:17:15,917
<i>Dr. Llewellyn to OR 2.</i>

390
00:17:15,985 --> 00:17:17,535
<i>Chisel, please.</i>

391
00:17:18,922 --> 00:17:20,805
Man, look at all
this callus formation.

392
00:17:20,857 --> 00:17:22,835
He would've had to break
this arm three or four times

393
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:24,575
to get this amount
of scar tissue.

394
00:17:27,062 --> 00:17:29,262
And the humerus is pretty
strong, even in a young kid.

395
00:17:31,834 --> 00:17:34,601
Kinda makes you sick just
thinking about the amount of

396
00:17:34,671 --> 00:17:35,970
force it took to break it.

397
00:17:36,039 --> 00:17:38,439
Can we talk about
something else?

398
00:17:42,378 --> 00:17:45,813
I mean, you know, who knows
what they hear subconsciously?

399
00:17:46,349 --> 00:17:48,365
So it...

400
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:50,713
Maybe it wouldn't hurt to
come up with a conversation

401
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:53,738
about something other than
every parent's worst nightmare.

402
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:58,553
Avery scored an
interview at UCLA.

403
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:00,144
That is not what she meant.

404
00:18:00,196 --> 00:18:02,391
No, that, that's good.
Let's hear about that.

405
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:04,849
Well, it's a top-10 program,
which is impressive.

406
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:07,078
Of course, it's just
as much a reflection

407
00:18:07,102 --> 00:18:09,636
on me as a teacher
as it is his surgical skill.

408
00:18:09,705 --> 00:18:10,888
Okay.

409
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:17,828
Hey. How was Canada?

410
00:18:17,896 --> 00:18:19,724
Canada would've been
better than that dump.

411
00:18:19,748 --> 00:18:21,843
You want me to call
the Chief at Duke?

412
00:18:21,867 --> 00:18:24,763
He wants me so bad, he'll do
anything I tell him, even accept you.

413
00:18:24,787 --> 00:18:25,886
<i>Drill, please.</i>

414
00:18:25,955 --> 00:18:27,649
What's Hunt gonna
do anyway if you leave?

415
00:18:27,673 --> 00:18:29,006
Oh, that's right.

416
00:18:29,058 --> 00:18:31,509
You say "Duke," and
he's on the next plane.

417
00:18:31,577 --> 00:18:33,511
Guy's so whipped.

418
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:36,163
She's not going to
Duke, and neither are you.

419
00:18:36,232 --> 00:18:37,798
This is a great program,

420
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:39,633
and we'd be crazy to leave.

421
00:18:39,702 --> 00:18:41,980
That's because you want
to play shrink to your patient

422
00:18:42,004 --> 00:18:43,214
for the rest of your life.

423
00:18:43,238 --> 00:18:45,083
She imprinted on me.
What am I supposed to do?

424
00:18:45,107 --> 00:18:46,218
How's she doing anyway?

425
00:18:46,242 --> 00:18:47,925
Great. I mean, better.

426
00:18:47,994 --> 00:18:50,761
I found two granola bars
under her bed this morning.

427
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:53,464
But at least she didn't lie
about where they came from.

428
00:18:53,533 --> 00:18:55,733
Fincher says she's
talking more in therapy,

429
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,835
although she's not talking
to Frank and Kathleen.

430
00:18:57,904 --> 00:19:00,687
She was being kept 5
miles away from their house,

431
00:19:00,756 --> 00:19:01,938
and they didn't find her.

432
00:19:02,008 --> 00:19:04,491
You don't just get over
something like that.

433
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:09,148
Maybe she could move in
with you when we all leave.

434
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:17,805
Adele, baby.

435
00:19:19,876 --> 00:19:21,842
Are you ready for dinner?

436
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:24,428
This is a private room!

437
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,264
Get out!

438
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:27,648
You get that man out of here!

439
00:19:27,716 --> 00:19:29,333
Dr. Webber... It's assault.

440
00:19:29,402 --> 00:19:30,996
She was vulnerable.
You just don't let a man...

441
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,714
Please, sir... He took
advantage of my wife.

442
00:19:32,738 --> 00:19:34,972
He's a predator. If you
don't get him out, I will sue.

443
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,574
Dr. Webber, Allan
has Alzheimer's.

444
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:40,883
His is quite progressed, further
along than your wife's, even.

445
00:19:41,197 --> 00:19:42,830
He's not a predator.

446
00:19:42,898 --> 00:19:44,214
He's a patient here.

447
00:19:52,592 --> 00:19:54,537
I don't have to tell
you that Columbia

448
00:19:54,561 --> 00:19:56,455
has a cutting-edge
cardio program.

449
00:19:56,479 --> 00:19:58,324
So I hope the fact that
I've flown cross country

450
00:19:58,348 --> 00:19:59,491
to come knocking on your door

451
00:19:59,515 --> 00:20:01,327
shows you just how
serious we are about...

452
00:20:01,351 --> 00:20:03,501
Can you pass me the butter?

453
00:20:05,521 --> 00:20:06,537
Yeah.

454
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:08,289
Thank you.

455
00:20:08,357 --> 00:20:10,502
You should come
to New York to visit.

456
00:20:10,526 --> 00:20:13,255
You like theater? I can get you
tickets to any musical you'd like.

457
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:14,679
I hate musicals.

458
00:20:14,747 --> 00:20:16,297
I do like wine, though.

459
00:20:17,217 --> 00:20:18,231
Waiter.

460
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,260
More wine. Coming.

461
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:22,886
There's an old
fracture in your pelvis

462
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:24,599
that Dr. Torres is
concerned about.

463
00:20:24,623 --> 00:20:26,285
It's called an
avulsion fracture.

464
00:20:26,309 --> 00:20:28,987
At first I thought it might have
happened when you ran away,

465
00:20:29,011 --> 00:20:30,789
but this injury is a
lot older than that.

466
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:32,407
Do you remember
when the pain first started

467
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:34,831
or anything that might've
happened right before that?

468
00:20:36,251 --> 00:20:37,668
A fall, maybe?

469
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:39,336
No, I don't.

470
00:20:41,608 --> 00:20:43,307
Oh.

471
00:20:43,376 --> 00:20:45,759
Maybe it happened
after I had the baby.

472
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:49,447
It was a few years ago.

473
00:20:49,515 --> 00:20:50,681
I think it died.

474
00:20:52,518 --> 00:20:55,502
I couldn't walk for
a long time after. I...

475
00:20:55,571 --> 00:20:57,104
It must have
happened then, right?

476
00:20:57,173 --> 00:20:59,556
Uh...

477
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:01,225
That's...

478
00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:02,960
Yes, that's...

479
00:21:03,946 --> 00:21:05,546
I'm sorry. I didn't...

480
00:21:05,614 --> 00:21:06,992
No. No, it's... Should...

481
00:21:07,016 --> 00:21:08,432
Should I not have said anything?

482
00:21:08,501 --> 00:21:09,834
Excuse me.

483
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:12,703
It's okay.

484
00:21:18,177 --> 00:21:19,477
Sorry I'm late.

485
00:21:19,545 --> 00:21:22,846
No, it's been a while since
you've been in my OR.

486
00:21:22,899 --> 00:21:24,381
I'm honored you showed up.

487
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:26,010
Has Grey been ditching
you, too, for interviews?

488
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:27,952
Cristina has been so distracted.

489
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,965
Meredith, do you know
who she's talking to today?

490
00:21:29,989 --> 00:21:31,049
Stanford, I think.

491
00:21:31,073 --> 00:21:32,472
Stanford?

492
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,508
Since when has she been
interested in Stanford?

493
00:21:34,577 --> 00:21:37,139
You blame her? You'd be a fool
not to pursue cardio at Stanford.

494
00:21:37,163 --> 00:21:39,847
Kinda like general
at the Brigham.

495
00:21:39,915 --> 00:21:41,715
I told you, the program director

496
00:21:41,784 --> 00:21:43,579
was very understanding
when I called.

497
00:21:43,603 --> 00:21:45,936
And you believed her
after canceling three times?

498
00:21:46,005 --> 00:21:47,816
You know how many strings I
had to pull to get you in there?

499
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,251
Well, the Chief
assigned this case to me.

500
00:21:49,275 --> 00:21:50,557
What am I supposed to do?

501
00:21:50,626 --> 00:21:52,454
Stanford? I mean,
that is just... That's far.

502
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:54,695
Hunt is really okay with that?

503
00:21:58,116 --> 00:22:01,236
Grey, will you tie these
vessels off? Mmm-hmm.

504
00:22:02,922 --> 00:22:04,816
She's been through enough.
She doesn't need to worry

505
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,735
about some jerk taking
her picture in the hall.

506
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:08,158
I am so sorry.

507
00:22:08,227 --> 00:22:09,910
Well, don't be, just...

508
00:22:10,729 --> 00:22:12,229
Help me, okay?

509
00:22:13,132 --> 00:22:14,648
Help me keep her safe.

510
00:22:14,716 --> 00:22:15,999
It won't happen again.

511
00:22:31,033 --> 00:22:33,551
Hey, Teddy needed
you to sign off

512
00:22:33,619 --> 00:22:35,402
on the stem cell
paperwork. Okay.

513
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:43,522
People have cameras
on their phones.

514
00:22:43,546 --> 00:22:46,225
He can't expect you to ban
phones from the hospital.

515
00:22:46,249 --> 00:22:49,216
No, no, but I can make sure
that the hallways are clear

516
00:22:49,285 --> 00:22:52,586
before they move her, or
security keeps a lookout.

517
00:22:52,654 --> 00:22:55,406
I'm not thinking.
I'm making mistakes.

518
00:22:56,342 --> 00:22:57,941
In over my head.

519
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,973
I wasn't supposed
to be the Chief.

520
00:23:01,997 --> 00:23:04,798
I wasn't supposed
to be this guy. I'm...

521
00:23:07,236 --> 00:23:08,302
I mean, how am I the guy

522
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:10,270
that ends up making
this man's daughter

523
00:23:10,339 --> 00:23:11,972
more hurt than she already is?

524
00:23:12,041 --> 00:23:13,940
I'm just... I'm failing. I'm...

525
00:23:18,865 --> 00:23:21,146
You're doing the best you can.

526
00:23:28,123 --> 00:23:30,408
And how was your day,
my little scootchie coo?

527
00:23:30,476 --> 00:23:32,659
Did you just have so
much fun playing with Zola?

528
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:34,189
You know, she doesn't
understand you any better

529
00:23:34,213 --> 00:23:35,462
the more idiotic you sound.

530
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:37,542
Hey, Zola. Good evening.

531
00:23:37,566 --> 00:23:39,466
Good evening. How are you?

532
00:23:39,535 --> 00:23:40,651
Tuck?

533
00:23:41,553 --> 00:23:42,570
Tucker?

534
00:23:43,388 --> 00:23:44,754
Hey, don't be shy.

535
00:23:44,823 --> 00:23:46,473
Hey, where's Tuck?

536
00:23:48,678 --> 00:23:51,295
I'm not sure. He was just here.

537
00:23:51,363 --> 00:23:54,326
You don't know? You know it's
your job to know where my son is?

538
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:56,077
Tara, when's the last
time you saw him?

539
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:58,969
A few minutes ago. I
swear, he was right here.

540
00:23:59,037 --> 00:24:00,403
A few...

541
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,118
Call a code pink.

542
00:24:14,186 --> 00:24:15,297
Right now. What?

543
00:24:15,321 --> 00:24:16,721
No, there's a
protocol for a code.

544
00:24:16,772 --> 00:24:19,589
Hey, hey, my son is
missing. Okay? He's gone.

545
00:24:19,658 --> 00:24:22,337
You took your eyes off
of him, and he's gone.

546
00:24:22,361 --> 00:24:24,161
Now you pick up that phone

547
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:26,563
and you make
that call right now,

548
00:24:26,615 --> 00:24:28,775
or I swear to God, I
will have your throat.

549
00:24:29,268 --> 00:24:30,501
Tara, just do it.

550
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:32,886
Just call the code pink!

551
00:24:32,955 --> 00:24:34,371
I'll look for him.

552
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,822
Yes, we have a code pink.

553
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:39,326
A 5-year-old boy, missing,
I'm not sure how long.

554
00:24:40,129 --> 00:24:42,462
I don't know.

555
00:24:42,531 --> 00:24:43,708
He's wearing a green-striped...

556
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:45,010
Please don't just
stand there. Okay?

557
00:24:45,034 --> 00:24:47,784
Look. Help me find him. Oh, God.

558
00:24:47,853 --> 00:24:49,486
He's probably screaming

559
00:24:49,555 --> 00:24:52,723
'cause he knows to
scream if there's a stranger.

560
00:24:54,427 --> 00:24:57,244
Oh, God. He's
screaming. He's screaming.

561
00:24:58,164 --> 00:24:59,396
Dr. Bailey.

562
00:24:59,465 --> 00:25:00,564
What?

563
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,083
He had a nosebleed.

564
00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:05,169
I took him to the nurse.

565
00:25:08,323 --> 00:25:10,974
What? What?

566
00:25:11,043 --> 00:25:12,893
There you are!

567
00:25:12,962 --> 00:25:15,362
Come here. Let
me see. Is that...

568
00:25:15,431 --> 00:25:16,880
Let me see that tissue.

569
00:25:16,949 --> 00:25:19,383
Oh, my goodness.

570
00:25:19,451 --> 00:25:20,545
Oh, well, then I guess...

571
00:25:20,569 --> 00:25:21,613
Yes, you can cancel.

572
00:25:21,637 --> 00:25:22,637
Where was he?

573
00:25:22,704 --> 00:25:23,971
Nosebleed.

574
00:25:24,039 --> 00:25:26,156
Get you an ice cream.

575
00:25:26,224 --> 00:25:29,126
Yeah? Yeah? Well, let's go home.

576
00:25:29,195 --> 00:25:31,895
And let's get some ice cream.

577
00:25:31,963 --> 00:25:33,296
Here. Come on, sweetheart.

578
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:36,734
I can't believe you
had a nosebleed.

579
00:25:39,671 --> 00:25:41,705
And

580
00:25:41,774 --> 00:25:43,454
that should just about do it.

581
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:44,956
Impressive.

582
00:25:46,311 --> 00:25:48,423
Most of our candidates
can't get the detail

583
00:25:48,447 --> 00:25:49,896
on the triangular fossa.

584
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:52,566
Yeah, well, if this whole
surgeon thing doesn't pan out,

585
00:25:52,635 --> 00:25:54,501
then I guess I could
take my act on the road.

586
00:25:54,569 --> 00:25:56,765
You know, just set up a little
whittling booth at a county fair.

587
00:25:56,789 --> 00:25:58,783
I think people would
pay good money for that,

588
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:02,726
especially when they hear it's
made by Harper Avery's grandson.

589
00:26:02,795 --> 00:26:04,828
Which reminds me,

590
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:06,992
do you think that he'd ever be
interested in doing a lecture here?

591
00:26:07,016 --> 00:26:09,182
We've been after him for years.

592
00:26:09,251 --> 00:26:10,251
Mmm.

593
00:26:12,938 --> 00:26:14,404
You're a name brand.

594
00:26:14,473 --> 00:26:16,150
You're like the freaking
Ritz-Carlton of surgery.

595
00:26:16,174 --> 00:26:18,086
Who cares if that's
why they want you?

596
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:20,855
Because he knows deep down
he's more of a roadside motel.

597
00:26:20,879 --> 00:26:22,830
Oh, she's going for the soup.

598
00:26:22,898 --> 00:26:25,010
Bold move. She's gonna
have to talk to the soup guy.

599
00:26:25,034 --> 00:26:27,346
She's looking good.
Looking confident.

600
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:28,618
And she bails.

601
00:26:28,687 --> 00:26:29,736
No soup for Holly.

602
00:26:29,822 --> 00:26:30,965
She looks terrified.

603
00:26:30,989 --> 00:26:32,105
Why are you so mean?

604
00:26:32,174 --> 00:26:33,435
Would you just go
buy her some soup?

605
00:26:33,459 --> 00:26:34,585
No, it's not mean.

606
00:26:34,609 --> 00:26:36,321
She's going home soon,
and Dr. Fincher says

607
00:26:36,345 --> 00:26:38,465
she has to learn to
do things for herself.

608
00:26:38,497 --> 00:26:40,642
And you're gonna finally have
to go to Boston for your interview.

609
00:26:40,666 --> 00:26:43,377
I am not avoiding
the interview. Really?

610
00:26:43,401 --> 00:26:44,852
Well, whenever you go,

611
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,597
just beware, they may judge
you more on your personality

612
00:26:46,621 --> 00:26:48,622
than what really
matters, like your resume.

613
00:26:48,691 --> 00:26:51,508
Meredith is not like you.
Her personality doesn't suck.

614
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,680
Pizza station.

615
00:26:54,113 --> 00:26:55,178
Hey.

616
00:26:57,983 --> 00:27:00,133
Whatever! You know what?
Those programs can suck it.

617
00:27:00,202 --> 00:27:03,203
I'm tired of trying so hard not to
be me. You know what? I like me.

618
00:27:03,271 --> 00:27:05,072
That makes one of us.

619
00:27:05,141 --> 00:27:06,240
You make it so easy.

620
00:27:06,308 --> 00:27:07,703
Look, you don't
have to not be you.

621
00:27:07,727 --> 00:27:09,204
Just be a little
less you. That's all.

622
00:27:09,228 --> 00:27:10,872
Get up. What are you doing?

623
00:27:10,896 --> 00:27:12,257
Claire Hiatt just
called to tell me

624
00:27:12,281 --> 00:27:13,642
you walked out
on your interview.

625
00:27:13,666 --> 00:27:15,666
Call her back, apologize.

626
00:27:15,735 --> 00:27:17,901
Look, I respectfully
withdrew my application.

627
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:19,831
You want me to drag
you out by your ear?

628
00:27:19,855 --> 00:27:20,921
I...

629
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:26,310
Freaking Robbins.

630
00:27:29,715 --> 00:27:33,484
Uh... So I didn't
actually speak to anyone.

631
00:27:33,552 --> 00:27:35,819
But I

632
00:27:35,888 --> 00:27:38,522
did go to the
self-serve station.

633
00:27:39,692 --> 00:27:41,325
And it actually
wasn't that hard.

634
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,533
What?

635
00:27:49,601 --> 00:27:51,351
Nothing. Looks good.

636
00:27:59,477 --> 00:28:01,294
You know who is
an awesome mentor?

637
00:28:01,363 --> 00:28:02,691
You're gonna say me, and
we're gonna high-five, right?

638
00:28:02,715 --> 00:28:04,781
Sloan. He gets Avery
interviews at hospitals

639
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:07,162
who have more to offer than
the sundaes in their cafeteria.

640
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:09,463
Oh, relax. I just heard back
from a colleague in Florida,

641
00:28:09,487 --> 00:28:10,727
and he's dying to meet you.

642
00:28:10,756 --> 00:28:12,167
Miami? Tampa.

643
00:28:12,191 --> 00:28:13,707
Well, just a little outside.

644
00:28:13,776 --> 00:28:16,242
Why are you doing this?
I thought you liked me.

645
00:28:16,312 --> 00:28:18,356
Of course I do, that's
why I've spent tons of time

646
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:20,092
turning you into a great doctor.

647
00:28:20,116 --> 00:28:21,743
And now for my trouble,
what, you're gonna ditch me

648
00:28:21,767 --> 00:28:23,066
for some other program?

649
00:28:23,135 --> 00:28:24,484
You don't want me to go.

650
00:28:24,552 --> 00:28:27,620
You've been tanking
my recommendations.

651
00:28:27,689 --> 00:28:30,139
I know. It's awful. I
feel really guilty about it.

652
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:32,286
But you don't know how hard
it is to find a good peds fellow,

653
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:34,761
and I'm not gonna let them
take my best candidate.

654
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:37,247
I'm your best?

655
00:28:37,316 --> 00:28:38,382
Go away.

656
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:40,083
Look, get on the phone,

657
00:28:40,152 --> 00:28:41,429
tell the people you actually
respect that I'm the best,

658
00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:43,370
Yale, Baylor, Brown.

659
00:28:43,438 --> 00:28:45,083
No more "one hour
outside of Toledos."

660
00:28:45,107 --> 00:28:47,235
Did you not just hear me?
I'm not gonna help you leave.

661
00:28:47,259 --> 00:28:48,887
You want me to stay
here because I want to,

662
00:28:48,911 --> 00:28:51,311
not because I have
no other choice.

663
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:52,863
Call.

664
00:28:56,584 --> 00:28:59,619
Hey. How are you feeling?

665
00:28:59,688 --> 00:29:01,288
That was a pretty big deal.

666
00:29:01,356 --> 00:29:03,134
Not really. I don't know.

667
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:05,198
Braving that cafeteria
line is pretty major,

668
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:06,554
even for those of us
who haven't been...

669
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:08,111
Kept in a basement for 12 years?

670
00:29:08,179 --> 00:29:09,641
For those of us who
haven't been through

671
00:29:09,665 --> 00:29:10,930
what you've been through.

672
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:13,099
Why do you do that,

673
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:14,701
talk around it?

674
00:29:14,769 --> 00:29:16,669
The therapist and
my parents and...

675
00:29:17,823 --> 00:29:20,123
What I've been through is being

676
00:29:20,192 --> 00:29:23,527
kicked and raped and
slapped and starved.

677
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:25,445
I mean, I get it, but...

678
00:29:25,514 --> 00:29:27,114
It was my life.

679
00:29:28,517 --> 00:29:31,084
And I didn't get to talk to him

680
00:29:31,153 --> 00:29:32,552
about my life with my parents,

681
00:29:32,621 --> 00:29:35,738
and now I don't get to
talk to anyone about him.

682
00:29:37,009 --> 00:29:38,775
But you can talk about him.

683
00:29:38,844 --> 00:29:39,876
No, I can't.

684
00:29:40,712 --> 00:29:42,446
No, you'll think...

685
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:46,536
You won't get it. Try me.

686
00:29:51,774 --> 00:29:53,740
He wasn't only bad.

687
00:29:53,808 --> 00:29:55,692
Sometimes he was okay.

688
00:29:56,528 --> 00:29:58,662
He'd let me go upstairs and

689
00:29:59,898 --> 00:30:01,932
we'd watch stuff together,

690
00:30:02,601 --> 00:30:03,800
movies.

691
00:30:05,403 --> 00:30:07,403
And it was like it was normal.

692
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:10,774
When I came back here, I
turned on the TV, and there was

693
00:30:10,843 --> 00:30:14,344
this movie on that
we watched together.

694
00:30:15,714 --> 00:30:17,530
And I started to miss him.

695
00:30:19,435 --> 00:30:21,735
And I know that's
bad, and I must be sick.

696
00:30:21,803 --> 00:30:25,004
And don't tell the shrink that
I said anything, 'cause she...

697
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:27,107
She's gonna ask
me how I feel about it.

698
00:30:28,376 --> 00:30:30,010
And I don't know.

699
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,880
All I know is

700
00:30:33,949 --> 00:30:36,950
I should be happy that
I'm here and not there.

701
00:30:40,322 --> 00:30:41,721
But sometimes I'm not.

702
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:43,030
That's okay.

703
00:30:44,743 --> 00:30:46,743
However you feel is okay.

704
00:30:51,483 --> 00:30:54,617
They've called three times
to see if you'd received it.

705
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:57,520
What self-respecting program
sends a fruit basket anyway?

706
00:30:57,589 --> 00:30:59,823
Champagne, sure, but fruit?

707
00:30:59,892 --> 00:31:01,402
Fruit just says
your program sucks.

708
00:31:01,426 --> 00:31:02,476
Who's that?

709
00:31:03,745 --> 00:31:04,794
Hopkins.

710
00:31:07,416 --> 00:31:09,032
Hopkins in Maryland?

711
00:31:11,336 --> 00:31:12,419
Yeah.

712
00:31:14,356 --> 00:31:15,755
Hopkins is a great program.

713
00:31:15,824 --> 00:31:18,519
And they're recruiting
you, so that's...

714
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:20,903
That's something to be proud of.

715
00:31:26,835 --> 00:31:27,934
Do you want an apple?

716
00:31:28,003 --> 00:31:29,085
Yeah.

717
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:43,766
You have a better
view of the pond.

718
00:31:47,206 --> 00:31:49,740
You know, I heard that Mrs.
Thompson across the hall

719
00:31:49,808 --> 00:31:51,407
has a great movie collection.

720
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,147
Adele, what is it?

721
00:31:57,215 --> 00:32:00,200
He hasn't come to visit or call.

722
00:32:00,268 --> 00:32:02,549
I don't know what I did wrong.

723
00:32:03,705 --> 00:32:06,506
You did nothing
wrong, honey. It's just...

724
00:32:07,709 --> 00:32:10,827
I'm your husband
for 30 years now.

725
00:32:10,896 --> 00:32:12,663
I'm right here. I...

726
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:17,384
This is us

727
00:32:18,787 --> 00:32:20,737
on our wedding day.

728
00:32:20,806 --> 00:32:23,046
Your mother took it
right after the ceremony.

729
00:32:24,292 --> 00:32:25,625
You and...

730
00:32:27,295 --> 00:32:28,428
We're married?

731
00:32:28,497 --> 00:32:29,862
Yes, honey.

732
00:32:32,568 --> 00:32:34,934
I proposed on New Year's,

733
00:32:35,003 --> 00:32:37,653
and we were married
the Valentine's after.

734
00:33:10,138 --> 00:33:11,304
Allan?

735
00:33:12,274 --> 00:33:14,341
Where's Allan?

736
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:17,176
Can you help me
find him, sir, please?

737
00:33:17,246 --> 00:33:19,224
This isn't like
him. He loves me.

738
00:33:19,248 --> 00:33:22,131
He wouldn't just
disappear. He loves me.

739
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,367
Allan?

740
00:33:24,703 --> 00:33:26,035
Where are you?

741
00:33:26,104 --> 00:33:28,739
Allan, please come home, baby.

742
00:33:28,807 --> 00:33:30,207
Please.

743
00:33:32,711 --> 00:33:35,428
The CT showed a leak
in her celiac artery graft,

744
00:33:35,497 --> 00:33:37,396
so we have to take her
into the OR right away.

745
00:33:37,465 --> 00:33:38,665
Where's Bailey?

746
00:33:38,733 --> 00:33:40,345
I think you should go in
and say good-bye to her

747
00:33:40,369 --> 00:33:42,118
before we take her to surgery.

748
00:33:42,988 --> 00:33:44,237
No.

749
00:33:44,306 --> 00:33:46,172
No, you go do that.

750
00:33:46,241 --> 00:33:47,284
Help her. Please.

751
00:33:47,308 --> 00:33:48,758
Kathleen, this is very serious.

752
00:33:48,827 --> 00:33:51,307
She doesn't trust
us like she trusts you.

753
00:33:51,613 --> 00:33:53,063
Take care of her, please.

754
00:33:54,233 --> 00:33:56,666
She's crashing. I
need a chest tray.

755
00:33:56,735 --> 00:33:58,568
Let's get some gloves.
Coming through.

756
00:33:58,637 --> 00:34:00,504
She arrested. I need
to crack her chest.

757
00:34:00,572 --> 00:34:01,804
Someone page Altman.

758
00:34:06,344 --> 00:34:07,494
Let's get some drapes.

759
00:34:10,899 --> 00:34:12,415
Scalpel.

760
00:34:12,484 --> 00:34:13,550
Thank you.

761
00:34:15,654 --> 00:34:16,669
Rib spreaders.

762
00:34:20,375 --> 00:34:22,175
- I need some suction.
- Suction.

763
00:34:22,944 --> 00:34:24,344
Let's get those blinds.

764
00:34:32,437 --> 00:34:35,254
Patient is 18-year-old
female Holly Wheeler.

765
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:36,455
Dr. Altman?

766
00:34:36,524 --> 00:34:39,309
I got the page from
Dr. Yang at 22:18,

767
00:34:39,378 --> 00:34:41,928
and then met her and
Dr. Bailey in the OR.

768
00:34:41,997 --> 00:34:44,080
Where we discovered
that the previous graft

769
00:34:44,149 --> 00:34:45,932
had become infected.

770
00:34:46,001 --> 00:34:48,869
While we tried to interpose
another graft away from the infection,

771
00:34:48,937 --> 00:34:51,337
she arrested several
times on the table.

772
00:34:51,406 --> 00:34:54,140
We had to restart
internal cardiac massage,

773
00:34:54,208 --> 00:34:56,004
give her an intracardiac epi,

774
00:34:56,028 --> 00:34:58,556
and fortunately, we were
able to resuscitate her.

775
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:01,914
Dr. Bailey was then
able to repair the graft

776
00:35:01,983 --> 00:35:05,201
and other than some initial
touch-and-go in the CCU,

777
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:06,680
she has been stable ever since.

778
00:35:06,704 --> 00:35:07,720
Your recommendation?

779
00:35:07,789 --> 00:35:09,989
Patient is healthy
and ready to go home.

780
00:35:10,542 --> 00:35:13,025
Neuro? Signed off.

781
00:35:13,094 --> 00:35:14,555
Ortho? We're good.

782
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:16,413
Plastics? Send her home.

783
00:35:16,481 --> 00:35:17,647
And general?

784
00:35:24,272 --> 00:35:25,705
Dr. Bailey?

785
00:35:32,597 --> 00:35:34,447
Dr. Bailey signs off. - Great.

786
00:35:34,533 --> 00:35:37,650
Well, Holly will continue
her therapy with Dr. Fincher,

787
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:40,753
but as far as
surgery is concerned,

788
00:35:40,822 --> 00:35:42,372
she's set to go home.

789
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:46,626
Thank you, everyone, and
especially, a thank you to Dr. Grey.

790
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:01,457
Okay, that's...

791
00:36:01,527 --> 00:36:03,567
That's enough. Let's
get back to work.

792
00:36:11,653 --> 00:36:13,573
Great job, Hunt.
Thanks. Thank you.

793
00:36:21,279 --> 00:36:23,295
They're good parents, right?

794
00:36:23,364 --> 00:36:25,576
I mean, they seem
like good parents.

795
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,034
They've been here every
day since you came in,

796
00:36:28,103 --> 00:36:31,104
all day, just in case
you want to see them.

797
00:36:32,924 --> 00:36:35,274
I have a daughter.

798
00:36:35,343 --> 00:36:38,428
And I know I would want
to hold her and never let go.

799
00:36:38,496 --> 00:36:39,696
And they haven't done that.

800
00:36:39,764 --> 00:36:41,264
They have tried
to give you space

801
00:36:41,333 --> 00:36:45,735
and just tried to understand
what this must be like for you.

802
00:36:45,804 --> 00:36:47,586
Just give them a chance.

803
00:36:47,655 --> 00:36:51,274
Just talk to them the
way you talk to me.

804
00:36:51,342 --> 00:36:53,037
The car's all packed.
We have everything?

805
00:36:53,061 --> 00:36:54,861
Yeah, I think so.

806
00:36:57,966 --> 00:36:59,216
We can't thank you enough.

807
00:36:59,284 --> 00:37:01,217
Of course.

808
00:37:01,286 --> 00:37:03,820
You don't want to
leave this behind.

809
00:37:04,456 --> 00:37:05,456
Uh...

810
00:37:06,408 --> 00:37:07,507
Yeah.

811
00:37:10,429 --> 00:37:12,712
Actually, I do.

812
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:15,115
I don't know. It just
reminds me of everything

813
00:37:15,183 --> 00:37:17,901
that I missed out on.

814
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:20,103
I'm sorry. I know that it
means a lot to you guys,

815
00:37:20,171 --> 00:37:22,305
so we can take it
if you want, but...

816
00:37:22,373 --> 00:37:24,774
No, it's fine. We can leave it.

817
00:37:35,219 --> 00:37:37,739
<i>It's one of those
things that people say.</i>

818
00:37:40,058 --> 00:37:42,959
<i>You can't move on until
you've let go of the past.</i>

819
00:37:43,027 --> 00:37:44,728
You have to make her stay.

820
00:37:44,796 --> 00:37:46,562
What? Cristina.

821
00:37:46,632 --> 00:37:48,943
She just told me that she is flying
to New York tonight to visit Columbia,

822
00:37:48,967 --> 00:37:50,695
and they are gonna roll
out the red carpet for her

823
00:37:50,719 --> 00:37:52,847
just like every other
hospital in this country.

824
00:37:52,871 --> 00:37:54,499
And pretty soon, we are gonna be

825
00:37:54,523 --> 00:37:56,100
one of ten places
that she can pick,

826
00:37:56,124 --> 00:37:57,373
and we are gonna lose her.

827
00:37:57,442 --> 00:37:58,774
We can't let that happen.

828
00:37:58,843 --> 00:38:02,283
She is gifted and
brilliant, and I...

829
00:38:03,065 --> 00:38:06,165
This hospital can't lose her.

830
00:38:06,234 --> 00:38:08,500
She wants to go.
It's her decision.

831
00:38:09,538 --> 00:38:10,786
I can't make her stay.

832
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:15,041
Owen, you are her husband,

833
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:16,888
and whatever is going on
between the two of you, I don't care.

834
00:38:16,912 --> 00:38:18,089
Just fix it and make her stay.

835
00:38:18,113 --> 00:38:19,379
You make her stay.

836
00:38:19,447 --> 00:38:21,359
You're the head of
cardio. She's your resident.

837
00:38:21,383 --> 00:38:24,283
If you want her to stay,
you make it happen.

838
00:38:24,352 --> 00:38:26,702
And don't you ever talk
to me about my wife again.

839
00:38:26,771 --> 00:38:28,354
I'm your Chief, not your friend.

840
00:38:28,423 --> 00:38:31,307
You've made that very clear.

841
00:38:31,376 --> 00:38:33,526
<i>Letting go is the easy part.</i>

842
00:38:36,364 --> 00:38:38,242
<i>It's the moving
on that's painful.</i>

843
00:38:38,266 --> 00:38:40,332
You have a good life here.

844
00:38:41,937 --> 00:38:44,671
You have friends, and,
you know, sometimes...

845
00:38:47,542 --> 00:38:51,161
Well, I can get in
the way of all that.

846
00:38:51,229 --> 00:38:54,247
Of course, now if
you need anything,

847
00:38:55,183 --> 00:38:56,582
just pick up the phone,

848
00:38:56,651 --> 00:38:59,131
and I'll stop everything,
and I'll come right over.

849
00:39:01,506 --> 00:39:02,639
I love you, Adele.

850
00:39:06,227 --> 00:39:07,293
And I always will.

851
00:39:24,396 --> 00:39:25,544
Allan.

852
00:39:27,382 --> 00:39:28,781
Come, come and sit down.

853
00:39:28,850 --> 00:39:30,850
I was just on my way out.

854
00:39:32,687 --> 00:39:34,320
Where have you been?

855
00:39:34,388 --> 00:39:36,422
I've been waiting for you.

856
00:39:38,543 --> 00:39:40,710
<i>So sometimes we fight it,</i>

857
00:39:54,593 --> 00:39:56,392
<i>try and keep things the same.</i>

858
00:39:56,461 --> 00:39:58,127
"Be less you"?

859
00:39:58,196 --> 00:39:59,579
How do you be less yourself?

860
00:40:04,135 --> 00:40:05,702
There.

861
00:40:05,771 --> 00:40:07,036
Less you.

862
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:12,776
What?

863
00:40:12,844 --> 00:40:14,443
You put on your suit?

864
00:40:14,496 --> 00:40:16,540
I gotta be at Yale first
thing in the morning.

865
00:40:16,564 --> 00:40:18,109
What if my flight gets delayed?

866
00:40:18,133 --> 00:40:20,278
Or even worse, what if you
go in there looking like a hobo

867
00:40:20,302 --> 00:40:21,701
in a wrinkled-ass jacket?

868
00:40:24,005 --> 00:40:25,183
Where'd you learn that?

869
00:40:25,207 --> 00:40:27,018
I'm an Avery. We
know these things.

870
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:32,495
Hey. So I rescheduled
my interview at Brigham,

871
00:40:32,563 --> 00:40:34,363
and I leave in an hour.

872
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:35,764
Cheers to that.

873
00:40:35,833 --> 00:40:37,967
Jackson, we gotta go.

874
00:40:38,035 --> 00:40:39,480
And we're out. Yeah.

875
00:40:39,504 --> 00:40:41,303
Happy interviewing, losers.

876
00:40:41,372 --> 00:40:42,772
I should go, too.

877
00:40:42,841 --> 00:40:44,607
Don't leave.

878
00:40:44,676 --> 00:40:46,703
It's Yale. No way in hell
am I missing that flight

879
00:40:46,727 --> 00:40:48,172
to hang out with you two drunks.

880
00:40:48,196 --> 00:40:49,676
Later. Don't choke.

881
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:53,977
Bartender. Yeah?

882
00:40:54,001 --> 00:40:55,841
Two tequilas, please. Two more.

883
00:40:58,589 --> 00:41:00,023
You know...

884
00:41:00,091 --> 00:41:02,303
This wouldn't be a totally
bad bar to hang out in

885
00:41:02,327 --> 00:41:03,626
if we miss our flights.

886
00:41:03,695 --> 00:41:05,472
Plenty of traveling
salesmen to hit on.

887
00:41:05,496 --> 00:41:07,936
Well, our husbands
would never know.

888
00:41:08,433 --> 00:41:09,943
Cheers. Cheers.

889
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:12,635
<i>Things can't stay
the same, though.</i>

890
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:16,472
<i>Flight 1243 to JFK is
now boarding at gate 19.</i>

891
00:41:16,541 --> 00:41:18,240
Well,

892
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:20,710
free flight to New York.

893
00:41:20,778 --> 00:41:22,077
I'd say wish me luck,

894
00:41:23,498 --> 00:41:24,696
but I don't need it.

895
00:41:27,435 --> 00:41:28,701
Cristina.

896
00:41:30,355 --> 00:41:32,438
You really want
to do this, leave?

897
00:41:32,507 --> 00:41:35,040
We've been preparing for
this for the past five years.

898
00:41:35,109 --> 00:41:36,425
Of course I want to leave.

899
00:41:38,296 --> 00:41:40,380
You should, too.

900
00:41:40,448 --> 00:41:43,248
<i>At some point, you
just have to let go,</i>

901
00:41:47,104 --> 00:41:48,438
<i>move on.</i>

902
00:41:51,976 --> 00:41:54,610
So if Miranda Bailey tells me

903
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:56,913
I need to meet a young surgeon,

904
00:41:56,982 --> 00:41:59,983
then it's obvious I
need to meet them.

905
00:42:00,051 --> 00:42:02,385
Still, before we go any further,

906
00:42:02,453 --> 00:42:04,787
I need to know
how serious you are

907
00:42:04,856 --> 00:42:06,756
about our program,

908
00:42:06,824 --> 00:42:08,290
moving to Boston.

909
00:42:08,343 --> 00:42:10,488
<i>Because no matter
how painful it is...</i>

910
00:42:10,512 --> 00:42:13,179
Very serious. In fact,
it's my top choice.

911
00:42:15,317 --> 00:42:17,366
<i>It's the only way we grow.</i>
