00:00:02,185 --> 00:00:03,296
<i>Previously on</i> Grey's Anatomy...

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:04,653
Zola was our baby,

3
00:00:04,721 --> 00:00:06,716
and she's gone and I
don't want another baby.

4
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,690
You and I broke up.

5
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:10,537
You basically told
me to wait for you.

6
00:00:10,561 --> 00:00:11,955
<i>What the hell happened?</i>

7
00:00:11,979 --> 00:00:14,191
That's the screw that I
just pulled out of her heart.

8
00:00:14,215 --> 00:00:16,459
I supervised you inserting
pedicle screws and a plate.

9
00:00:16,483 --> 00:00:17,649
She's half dead.

10
00:00:17,718 --> 00:00:19,412
<i>Dr. Altman's repairing
her heart right now.</i>

11
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:20,997
So who's gonna
be operating on me?

12
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,320
<i>Cristina.</i>

13
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:23,900
<i>It's her mentor's husband.</i>

14
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:25,802
<i>Cristina doesn't have
to know that it's Henry.</i>

15
00:00:25,826 --> 00:00:27,453
<i>Meredith and Alex are
trapped in an ambulance</i>

16
00:00:27,477 --> 00:00:29,756
<i>in the middle of the
highway. We think they got hit.</i>

17
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:31,408
<i>They're sitting in a powder keg.</i>

18
00:00:31,432 --> 00:00:33,392
We gotta get outta here
before this thing blows.

19
00:00:34,734 --> 00:00:36,702
<i>It's not right.</i>

20
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:38,197
<i>If she finds out that I waited,
she will never forgive me.</i>

21
00:00:38,221 --> 00:00:40,100
<i>Her husband just died in our OR.</i>

22
00:00:40,124 --> 00:00:41,964
<i>She'll never forgive any of us.</i>

23
00:00:45,562 --> 00:00:47,395
<i>Victims of a sudden impact</i>

24
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:49,364
<i>are some of the
hardest to treat.</i>

25
00:00:52,152 --> 00:00:54,670
<i>It's not just the collision
that injures them.</i>

26
00:00:54,738 --> 00:00:56,455
<i>It's everything after.</i>

27
00:00:56,524 --> 00:00:59,707
<i>The centrifugal force
keeps them moving,</i>

28
00:00:59,776 --> 00:01:01,393
<i>tossing them from vehicles,</i>

29
00:01:01,462 --> 00:01:04,178
<i>throwing them
through windshields,</i>

30
00:01:04,247 --> 00:01:07,866
<i>slamming their internal
organs into the skeleton.</i>

31
00:01:07,934 --> 00:01:10,202
<i>Their bodies are injured
over and over again.</i>

32
00:01:16,893 --> 00:01:20,013
<i>So there's no way to know how
much damage has actually been done.</i>

33
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:23,231
<i>Until they stop.</i>

34
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:27,085
Sir? Can you move?

35
00:01:27,154 --> 00:01:29,087
We need to get
you off this road.

36
00:01:29,156 --> 00:01:30,288
Honey.

37
00:01:31,274 --> 00:01:32,524
Jessica.

38
00:01:33,026 --> 00:01:34,409
Answer me.

39
00:01:36,914 --> 00:01:38,380
Mom?

40
00:01:38,448 --> 00:01:40,966
Mom. Mom, wake up.

41
00:01:41,802 --> 00:01:43,384
Mom, wake up!

42
00:01:43,471 --> 00:01:44,786
Sorry.

43
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:46,383
Help them, please.
You have to help!

44
00:01:46,407 --> 00:01:47,672
My mom, my dad,

45
00:01:47,741 --> 00:01:49,808
the van, and I just
stepped in blood.

46
00:01:49,877 --> 00:01:51,754
- I just stepped in blood.
- Hey, what's your name?

47
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:53,707
Lilly. Okay, Lilly, I
need you to calm down

48
00:01:53,731 --> 00:01:55,213
and take the baby.
Hold the baby.

49
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:56,692
I don't even babysit.
I can't hold a baby.

50
00:01:56,716 --> 00:01:58,344
Lilly, do you want me to
help your family or not?

51
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:00,285
Hold the baby.

52
00:02:00,354 --> 00:02:03,021
Okay, I need you to
squeeze. One, two, squeeze.

53
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:04,456
What if I mess up?

54
00:02:04,525 --> 00:02:06,808
You're not gonna mess
up, Lilly. One, two, squeeze.

55
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:08,237
Count out loud
so I can hear you.

56
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:10,045
Okay, one, two, squeeze.

57
00:02:10,114 --> 00:02:11,630
One, two, squeeze.

58
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:13,410
No matter what you
do, don't stop squeezing.

59
00:02:13,434 --> 00:02:14,883
One, two, squeeze.

60
00:02:14,951 --> 00:02:16,618
One, two, squeeze.

61
00:02:16,687 --> 00:02:17,952
One, two, squeeze.

62
00:02:18,021 --> 00:02:19,037
Yeah.

63
00:02:19,106 --> 00:02:22,040
Ma'am, ma'am, I'm a
doctor. Can you hear me?

64
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:28,758
I don't know. Three
or four hours, I think.

65
00:02:28,782 --> 00:02:31,061
Yeah, you know what? Hang
on a second. The doctor's back.

66
00:02:31,085 --> 00:02:32,317
This is Laura's mom.

67
00:02:32,386 --> 00:02:33,980
She wants to know how
long the surgery should take.

68
00:02:34,004 --> 00:02:35,437
That depends.

69
00:02:35,506 --> 00:02:36,916
Dr. Altman is working
on the repair right now.

70
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:38,306
Did you hear that?

71
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:40,174
Um, he says
Dr. Altman's still...

72
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:42,594
No, Altman.

73
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:43,928
No, for the heart.

74
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:46,648
You know, can you talk to her?

75
00:02:46,716 --> 00:02:50,085
Yeah. Hi, this is Dr. Avery.

76
00:02:50,154 --> 00:02:52,074
She's a cardiothoracic surgeon.

77
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:55,674
No, no, this is the heart.

78
00:02:56,993 --> 00:03:00,261
No, it's really hard
to tell at this point.

79
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:01,908
Oh, no. This is cruel.

80
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:04,416
Her husband is dead,
and she has no idea.

81
00:03:04,485 --> 00:03:06,112
She's sewing a woman's
heart back together.

82
00:03:06,136 --> 00:03:07,664
Come on. There's gotta be
a better way to handle this.

83
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:09,232
There's no good way
to handle it, Bailey.

84
00:03:09,256 --> 00:03:11,256
This is an impossible decision.

85
00:03:11,325 --> 00:03:14,053
So you land on the side of
what is best for the patient,

86
00:03:14,077 --> 00:03:15,593
the one who's still alive.

87
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:16,995
Teddy will understand.

88
00:03:17,063 --> 00:03:18,063
You think so?

89
00:03:25,172 --> 00:03:27,633
You got any tape in there? I
have to do an adhesive dressing.

90
00:03:27,657 --> 00:03:29,068
Probably. I just
grabbed whatever.

91
00:03:29,092 --> 00:03:30,308
Is my mom okay? Mom?

92
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:31,526
Lilly, keep counting.

93
00:03:31,595 --> 00:03:32,977
Why isn't she talking?

94
00:03:33,647 --> 00:03:34,647
Lilly!

95
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:36,431
One, two, squeeze.

96
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,565
How's she doing?

97
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:39,812
Not good. I may
have to intubate.

98
00:03:39,836 --> 00:03:41,498
Don't you have to do
a pressure dressing?

99
00:03:41,522 --> 00:03:43,454
Ugh. I see gray matter.

100
00:03:43,523 --> 00:03:45,039
Brains are on the ground.

101
00:03:45,108 --> 00:03:46,452
Wait. That's Nana. That's my...

102
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:47,620
There's nothing we can do.

103
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:49,177
Oh, crap.

104
00:03:49,245 --> 00:03:51,746
This kid's got a shard
of glass in her eye.

105
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:53,515
She's unconscious.
Her pulse is low.

106
00:03:53,584 --> 00:03:55,512
That's my sister.
That's Abby. Lilly...

107
00:03:55,536 --> 00:03:57,013
Just see the blinker on the van?

108
00:03:57,037 --> 00:03:58,882
Just watch that blinker
and keep counting.

109
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:00,026
One, two, squeeze.

110
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,673
One, two, squeeze.

111
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:03,136
Lilly. The kids. The kids.

112
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,643
Your girls are okay, all right?

113
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:06,472
I just helped one and the
other one's right over there.

114
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:07,595
And Michael?

115
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,030
What about Michael?

116
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,516
There's another kid?

117
00:04:15,038 --> 00:04:16,278
Oh, crap.

118
00:04:17,057 --> 00:04:18,084
There's no pulse. Michael?

119
00:04:18,108 --> 00:04:19,124
Dad! Dad!

120
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:20,692
Lilly, keep counting!

121
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:22,243
One, two, squeeze.

122
00:04:22,312 --> 00:04:24,245
One, two, squeeze.

123
00:04:24,314 --> 00:04:26,447
One, two, squeeze.

124
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:27,756
Michael? Help.

125
00:04:27,818 --> 00:04:29,617
Help. Michael? Michael?

126
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:30,686
Help. Help.

127
00:04:30,754 --> 00:04:33,421
Okay. I'm gonna
check your pulse.

128
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:35,623
Pulse is a little weak.

129
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:37,503
All right. I'm gonna try
to free your legs, okay?

130
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:39,627
One, two, squeeze.

131
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:41,496
One, two, squeeze.

132
00:04:41,565 --> 00:04:43,247
One, two, squeeze.

133
00:04:45,602 --> 00:04:47,135
Meredith, there's a car coming!

134
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:48,436
Oh, crap.

135
00:04:48,505 --> 00:04:49,888
Can you feel your legs?

136
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:51,250
You gotta get outta there!
- Michael!

137
00:04:51,274 --> 00:04:53,241
He's trapped. I have
to get his legs free!

138
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:54,737
There's not time! Oh, my God!

139
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:56,361
Kid, just keep
counting. Meredith!

140
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:58,074
Oh, my God. You
gotta get off the road!

141
00:04:58,098 --> 00:04:59,948
Come on.

142
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:01,494
Come on! Oh, my God.

143
00:05:01,518 --> 00:05:02,695
Help me. Meredith!

144
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:04,599
Squeeze. No, don't leave me.

145
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:07,121
What the hell are you...
They're not even gonna see you!

146
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:08,573
Meredith, what are you doing?

147
00:05:09,926 --> 00:05:11,993
Stop! Please!

148
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:19,083
Son of a...

149
00:05:19,153 --> 00:05:21,052
It's okay. You're okay.

150
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:22,470
All right? Just breathe.

151
00:05:22,539 --> 00:05:24,255
Just breathe. Help is here.

152
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,858
Help is here.

153
00:05:26,926 --> 00:05:29,845
One, two, squeeze.
One, two, squeeze.

154
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:35,350
<i>One, two, squeeze.</i>

155
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,084
BP's down and she's tachycardic.

156
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:43,453
We gotta get her up to the NICU.

157
00:05:43,477 --> 00:05:44,642
Units of LR.

158
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:46,978
13-year-old female,
intubated in the field.

159
00:05:47,046 --> 00:05:49,258
Multiple facial fractures.
Foreign body to the eye.

160
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:50,593
You're bleeding,
you need stitches.

161
00:05:50,617 --> 00:05:52,657
No, I'll be okay. I'm
gonna take care of it.

162
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:54,502
Take the mom to trauma two.

163
00:05:54,571 --> 00:05:56,549
And we need to staff as
many ORs upstairs as possible.

164
00:05:56,573 --> 00:05:57,717
I'll take care of
it later, I promise.

165
00:05:57,741 --> 00:05:58,901
Go. We'll talk later.

166
00:05:59,542 --> 00:06:00,742
What do we got?

167
00:06:00,811 --> 00:06:02,655
14-year-old male,
trapped under the van.

168
00:06:02,679 --> 00:06:05,947
Abdominal pain. Last vitals
show a BP of 100 over 80

169
00:06:06,015 --> 00:06:07,615
and a pulse of 120.

170
00:06:07,684 --> 00:06:09,095
Grey, you need someone
to take a look at that?

171
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:10,530
It's fine. Where do you want me?

172
00:06:10,554 --> 00:06:11,764
Bailey needs hands on bed four.

173
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:13,454
Wait. Is that my mom?

174
00:06:13,523 --> 00:06:15,118
Could you get her back in
the bed? But that's my mom.

175
00:06:15,142 --> 00:06:16,925
She needs to be checked out.

176
00:06:16,994 --> 00:06:18,492
Dr. Hunt, how can I help?

177
00:06:18,561 --> 00:06:21,112
What are you doing here?
Is Altman out of surgery?

178
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,125
Almost. She's about
to take her off bypass,

179
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:24,510
but our pagers kept going off,

180
00:06:24,534 --> 00:06:26,062
so she figured, maybe
you need some extra help.

181
00:06:26,086 --> 00:06:28,319
Dr. Webber, I could use
you on this. You, too, Hunt.

182
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:29,587
Okay.

183
00:06:29,656 --> 00:06:32,156
Okay, go back into
Altman's surgery

184
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:34,136
and tell her that
I didn't need you.

185
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,238
I was really hoping to log
some more trauma hours.

186
00:06:36,262 --> 00:06:37,645
Kepner...

187
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:42,017
Altman's husband
died in surgery,

188
00:06:42,085 --> 00:06:44,085
and she doesn't know,
so I need you in the OR.

189
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:45,654
And page me the
moment that she's...

190
00:06:45,722 --> 00:06:47,288
Wait, wait. I'm sorry. What?

191
00:06:47,357 --> 00:06:48,518
Kepner. Kepner. Henry's...

192
00:06:48,542 --> 00:06:50,425
Can you handle this?

193
00:06:52,295 --> 00:06:53,761
Yeah, yes.

194
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,692
No. No, no, no. You can't
go into her surgery like that.

195
00:06:55,716 --> 00:06:58,566
So go to the gallery and
watch the surgery from there.

196
00:06:58,635 --> 00:06:59,835
Okay?

197
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,802
She went about two
hours with no antibiotics

198
00:07:05,826 --> 00:07:07,737
and an unknown amount of
fluids 'cause we didn't have a pump.

199
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:09,055
All right. Careful
with that suction.

200
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:10,456
We weren't able to
suction for a while.

201
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,657
Her pneumonia
may be getting worse.

202
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:12,792
She probably
needs another X-ray.

203
00:07:12,816 --> 00:07:14,182
Well, that's great.

204
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:15,995
You did extraordinary
work tonight, Karev.

205
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:18,019
I've got it from
here. No. What? No.

206
00:07:18,071 --> 00:07:19,648
Yes. You were in
a major accident.

207
00:07:19,672 --> 00:07:21,050
You need to go get
yourself checked out.

208
00:07:21,074 --> 00:07:22,551
Take a breath. You're
gonna sit this one out.

209
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:23,941
I'm not sitting anything out.

210
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:25,293
Yes, you are.

211
00:07:27,797 --> 00:07:28,864
Goodbye.

212
00:07:33,353 --> 00:07:34,919
Okay, what do we got?

213
00:07:34,988 --> 00:07:36,488
His pelvis is dust.

214
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:37,850
Must be massive
internal bleeding.

215
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:39,290
Can't keep his
systolic above 68.

216
00:07:39,359 --> 00:07:41,254
Okay, there's definitely
free fluid in his abdomen.

217
00:07:41,278 --> 00:07:43,589
It's just hard to define where
the bleeding's coming from.

218
00:07:43,613 --> 00:07:44,691
Where do you want to start?

219
00:07:44,715 --> 00:07:46,081
Pelvis. Abdomen.

220
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:51,114
Abby couldn't wait
to sleep in a tent.

221
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:52,270
Sir, I'm Dr. Hunt.

222
00:07:52,338 --> 00:07:53,578
BP's still dropping.

223
00:07:53,607 --> 00:07:54,734
We're gonna be taking
you up to surgery.

224
00:07:54,758 --> 00:07:55,952
Lilly didn't even want to come.

225
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:57,503
Okay, if we don't
stabilize this pelvis,

226
00:07:57,527 --> 00:07:59,072
there won't be any surgery.
There's no time for fixators.

227
00:07:59,096 --> 00:08:00,840
She wanted to spend
her birthday with friends,

228
00:08:00,864 --> 00:08:02,297
not camping with us.

229
00:08:02,366 --> 00:08:03,898
I said no.

230
00:08:03,967 --> 00:08:07,201
I made her come. Oh, my
God, I did this to them. I did this.

231
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:09,170
You didn't harm your family.

232
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:11,517
You didn't mean
for this to happen.

233
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:12,907
You didn't do this.

234
00:08:12,976 --> 00:08:14,375
Okay, sir, I am really sorry,

235
00:08:14,444 --> 00:08:16,484
but even with the
painkillers, this is gonna hurt.

236
00:08:18,315 --> 00:08:19,514
That should hold for now.

237
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:20,626
Okay, let's get him to surgery.

238
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:21,650
Okay.

239
00:08:23,019 --> 00:08:24,669
Altman paged. 9-1-1.

240
00:08:25,389 --> 00:08:26,771
Is everything okay?

241
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,422
Uh, we got this. Go.

242
00:08:28,491 --> 00:08:29,807
Scrub in when you can.

243
00:08:31,527 --> 00:08:32,638
You paged?

244
00:08:32,662 --> 00:08:34,673
Yeah, the patient's
got a flail mitral valve.

245
00:08:34,697 --> 00:08:36,325
The sutures for the patch caught

246
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:37,994
on the valve when
we went on bypass.

247
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:39,200
What can I do?

248
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:40,846
You can tell me
where Cristina is.

249
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:42,364
I've been paging her,
but she won't answer.

250
00:08:42,388 --> 00:08:44,088
Damn it. Why won't this hold?

251
00:08:44,157 --> 00:08:45,684
Okay, you need a resident?
I'll get you a resident.

252
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:47,659
No, not a resident. Yang.

253
00:08:47,728 --> 00:08:50,995
This is... I need another me,
and she is the closest thing.

254
00:08:51,064 --> 00:08:52,546
Don't tell her I said that.

255
00:08:52,616 --> 00:08:54,276
She just got out of
surgery. She's exhausted.

256
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,545
All right, well,
splash some water

257
00:08:55,569 --> 00:08:57,046
on her face and get her in here.

258
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:59,310
She can handle it.
All right, sponge stick.

259
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,739
Damn it.

260
00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:08,024
Let's get an irrigation tray
and start cleaning this up.

261
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:09,915
Craniofacial lac?

262
00:09:09,983 --> 00:09:11,115
It's worse than that.

263
00:09:11,184 --> 00:09:12,984
We're gonna need a
retinal-vitreous surgeon.

264
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:15,248
Yeah. I've got Lexie calling
around for one right now.

265
00:09:15,272 --> 00:09:18,151
Parker isn't answering, and Waldman
is gonna be at least another hour.

266
00:09:18,175 --> 00:09:19,340
Try Jassy.

267
00:09:19,409 --> 00:09:20,708
Jassy?

268
00:09:20,776 --> 00:09:23,595
No, I got someone who
will run circles around Jassy.

269
00:09:25,432 --> 00:09:27,098
Hey, babe.

270
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:29,167
Your girlfriend? Hold on, Julia.

271
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:30,529
She's great. You'll love her.

272
00:09:30,553 --> 00:09:32,098
Um, you know, it's gonna
take at least 45 minutes

273
00:09:32,122 --> 00:09:33,416
to get here from Seattle Pres.

274
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,018
She's not at Seattle
Pres. She's at my place.

275
00:09:35,042 --> 00:09:36,308
It's five minutes away.

276
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,520
Hey, how'd you like to operate
with me and Derek tonight?

277
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:43,280
It hurts. My
stomach really hurts.

278
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:45,127
Okay, Michael, we gave
you something for the pain.

279
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:46,345
It should kick in in a minute.

280
00:09:46,369 --> 00:09:47,802
Abdomen feels rigid.

281
00:09:49,739 --> 00:09:50,989
Yep.

282
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:52,657
Free fluid in the
right upper quadrant.

283
00:09:52,725 --> 00:09:54,637
So that could be a liver
lac. We should order a CT.

284
00:09:54,661 --> 00:09:56,305
No, keep trying! That's my mom!

285
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:58,073
Okay, Michael, I need
you to stay still, please.

286
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,547
What's going on?

287
00:09:59,615 --> 00:10:00,960
You can't just give up.
You have to keep trying.

288
00:10:00,984 --> 00:10:02,195
She already watched
the grandmother die.

289
00:10:02,219 --> 00:10:03,385
Yeah, go, go.

290
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:07,839
How long you been going?

291
00:10:07,908 --> 00:10:09,485
What have you given her, and
what have her rhythms been?

292
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:10,586
She's been coding
for 30 minutes.

293
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,721
She's already gotten lidocaine

294
00:10:11,745 --> 00:10:12,789
and amiodarone.

295
00:10:12,813 --> 00:10:14,023
Okay, her kid's outside
the window watching.

296
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:15,229
We need to go again.

297
00:10:15,298 --> 00:10:16,864
Charge to 360. Clear.

298
00:10:18,768 --> 00:10:19,851
Push another of epi.

299
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,103
Let's charge again. Please.

300
00:10:22,171 --> 00:10:23,337
Please.

301
00:10:23,406 --> 00:10:24,538
Dr. Grey.

302
00:10:25,108 --> 00:10:26,341
Damn it.

303
00:10:27,744 --> 00:10:28,977
Charge again.

304
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:31,612
Clear.

305
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:39,037
Damn it. Come on. Come on.

306
00:10:40,874 --> 00:10:41,973
Mom.

307
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:47,228
Time of death, 2:27.

308
00:11:12,372 --> 00:11:14,017
Hand me the ultrasound
and get me a kit.

309
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:15,401
We're doing a
bedside gastrostomy.

310
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:16,519
What do you think you're doing?

311
00:11:16,543 --> 00:11:17,903
We need to
decompress her stomach

312
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:19,205
so she doesn't get more
reflux into her trachea.

313
00:11:19,229 --> 00:11:20,505
Karev, you're not on this case.

314
00:11:20,529 --> 00:11:22,680
Look, I've been with
this baby since yesterday.

315
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:24,615
Okay? She almost
died. I almost died.

316
00:11:24,667 --> 00:11:26,948
I didn't go through hell
with this kid to just back off.

317
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,508
Then slow down.

318
00:11:33,577 --> 00:11:35,238
Okay? We don't need
to rush through this.

319
00:11:35,262 --> 00:11:36,742
Yeah, I know. Just,
suction, please.

320
00:11:38,765 --> 00:11:39,975
Cristina, just stop
for one minute

321
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:41,143
and listen to what I have to...

322
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:42,400
No. I said no.

323
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:44,430
I know you're exhausted.
This is a mitral valve...

324
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:45,620
I am not operating now!

325
00:11:45,689 --> 00:11:47,400
She requested you. Now,
if you don't go in there...

326
00:11:47,424 --> 00:11:48,923
Teddy requested me?

327
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,663
Oh, my God. You
haven't told her.

328
00:11:55,731 --> 00:11:57,364
You haven't told her yet?

329
00:11:57,433 --> 00:11:59,400
What are you... No, no.

330
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:01,336
No, I am not...
No, I'm not going in.

331
00:12:01,404 --> 00:12:03,282
Cristina, if that patient
dies on the table,

332
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:05,918
this will all have been
for nothing. This has...

333
00:12:05,942 --> 00:12:07,953
This has to be worth something.

334
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:10,217
Saving a life is
worth something.

335
00:12:12,349 --> 00:12:13,815
I can't.

336
00:12:13,883 --> 00:12:16,201
I can't. I can't. I can't do it.

337
00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:17,719
You have no choice.

338
00:12:18,371 --> 00:12:19,871
She's waiting.

339
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:21,822
So go.

340
00:12:24,444 --> 00:12:26,422
How much trauma has
your girlfriend done?

341
00:12:26,446 --> 00:12:27,545
A lot.

342
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:29,225
She's told me about
a bunch of her cases.

343
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:31,649
So we're just going
off your pillow talk?

344
00:12:31,701 --> 00:12:33,579
If I get a hint that your
girlfriend is in over her head,

345
00:12:33,603 --> 00:12:34,746
I'm gonna boot her out of my OR.

346
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:35,932
You know what your problem is?

347
00:12:35,956 --> 00:12:37,099
You don't think anyone
who sleeps with me

348
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:38,600
can be talented or
have half a brain.

349
00:12:38,624 --> 00:12:40,369
That is not true.
It's mostly true.

350
00:12:40,393 --> 00:12:41,770
Yeah. Yeah, it's mostly true.

351
00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:43,995
Your ex-wife is brilliant,
and she slept with me.

352
00:12:44,064 --> 00:12:45,729
Well, I'm not trying
to start a fight.

353
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:46,965
I'm just sayin'.

354
00:12:49,669 --> 00:12:51,335
Ah! Dr. Canner,

355
00:12:51,404 --> 00:12:53,382
thank you very much for
showing up on such short notice.

356
00:12:53,406 --> 00:12:54,772
No problem.

357
00:12:54,841 --> 00:12:56,835
Fastball here just updated
me about your patient.

358
00:12:56,859 --> 00:13:00,011
Again, I'm really sorry
for hitting you in the...

359
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:03,114
I'm fine. My breast
made a quick recovery.

360
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:04,315
It did.

361
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:06,300
Okay, Mark.

362
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:09,398
The glass penetrated the
globe through to the orbit.

363
00:13:09,422 --> 00:13:10,862
So she's gonna lose the eye?

364
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:12,190
Normally, yes.

365
00:13:12,259 --> 00:13:14,419
I was thinking, if you
used a temporal approach

366
00:13:14,477 --> 00:13:16,589
to expose the orbit and
decompress the eye,

367
00:13:16,613 --> 00:13:18,112
we could save it.

368
00:13:18,181 --> 00:13:20,209
Well, if you do that,
there's more risk of bleeding.

369
00:13:20,233 --> 00:13:21,398
That's true.

370
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:23,446
I could get control of
the blood supply first,

371
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:25,036
then enucleate the eye.

372
00:13:25,105 --> 00:13:27,654
But I think the
eye is salvageable.

373
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:29,540
Either way, it's your call.

374
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:32,627
Let's save the eye.

375
00:13:32,696 --> 00:13:33,995
Agreed.

376
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:45,957
Lilly.

377
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,127
I'm so sorry about your mom.

378
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:50,227
Yeah.

379
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:56,834
Your dad and your
sister are in surgery.

380
00:13:56,903 --> 00:13:58,380
And I'm about to
take your brother up

381
00:13:58,404 --> 00:14:00,382
to repair a tear in his liver.

382
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:02,723
Okay.

383
00:14:02,792 --> 00:14:04,303
Do you know if
anyone in your family

384
00:14:04,327 --> 00:14:06,026
is on any medications?

385
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:08,696
I don't know.

386
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:12,100
What about allergies?
Has anyone had surgery?

387
00:14:12,168 --> 00:14:14,619
I don't think so.

388
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:16,688
Do you remember your
parents talking about

389
00:14:16,756 --> 00:14:18,876
what they would do if
someone got really sick?

390
00:14:18,908 --> 00:14:21,976
Would they want
extraordinary measures taken?

391
00:14:22,044 --> 00:14:24,244
I'm sorry. I know it's
a difficult question,

392
00:14:24,313 --> 00:14:26,325
but anything you
could tell us would help.

393
00:14:26,349 --> 00:14:28,749
No. We don't talk
about stuff like that.

394
00:14:28,818 --> 00:14:30,885
We just talk about
normal things,

395
00:14:30,954 --> 00:14:33,120
so I don't...

396
00:14:33,189 --> 00:14:34,489
I don't know anything.

397
00:14:34,574 --> 00:14:36,785
Well, is there
anyone we can call?

398
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:39,209
Who takes care of you when
your parents go out of town?

399
00:14:41,847 --> 00:14:43,447
My grandma.

400
00:14:43,516 --> 00:14:46,984
But she's dead now, so...

401
00:14:56,245 --> 00:14:58,446
Okay, I've got the
bleeding under control.

402
00:14:58,514 --> 00:14:59,925
It's your turn, Dr. Canner.

403
00:14:59,949 --> 00:15:02,269
All right, pull up my
microscope, please.

404
00:15:02,952 --> 00:15:04,095
Dr. Shepherd.

405
00:15:04,119 --> 00:15:05,359
Okay, 4 by 4.

406
00:15:06,022 --> 00:15:07,054
Okay.

407
00:15:07,707 --> 00:15:09,974
Speculum. Saline.

408
00:15:11,978 --> 00:15:14,595
Dr. Shepherd. 4-0 silk.

409
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:15,703
Thank you.

410
00:15:24,391 --> 00:15:25,451
Damn it.

411
00:15:25,475 --> 00:15:27,035
Did you just push
the glass in deeper?

412
00:15:27,076 --> 00:15:29,171
You must have speared a
branch of the ophthalmic artery.

413
00:15:29,195 --> 00:15:30,361
Cautery.

414
00:15:31,881 --> 00:15:33,398
All right. Let me get in there.

415
00:15:33,466 --> 00:15:35,127
It's kind of hard right
now. My hand is in her eye.

416
00:15:35,151 --> 00:15:36,831
Forceps. Canner.

417
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:38,702
Hold on.

418
00:15:40,423 --> 00:15:41,672
There.

419
00:15:41,741 --> 00:15:43,341
Bone fragment.

420
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:45,409
Thank you. I'll be needing that.

421
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:49,441
A little bleeding is
natural, Dr. Shepherd.

422
00:15:49,465 --> 00:15:51,994
I'm not gonna find any more
little presents in there, am I?

423
00:15:52,018 --> 00:15:55,019
Okay, everyone, here
comes the fun part.

424
00:15:55,088 --> 00:15:56,248
Clamp.

425
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:14,512
All right.

426
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:21,812
Looks like a grade 4 liver lac.

427
00:16:21,881 --> 00:16:24,281
Grey, do you want to do
an omental pedicle repair?

428
00:16:24,351 --> 00:16:26,417
Absolutely. Okay.

429
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:29,336
Heard you lost one of your clinical
trial patients today, Dr. Bailey.

430
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:30,638
I'm sorry to hear...

431
00:16:30,706 --> 00:16:31,750
It wasn't my trial
that killed him.

432
00:16:31,774 --> 00:16:33,419
The man suffered
from Von-Hippel Lindau.

433
00:16:33,443 --> 00:16:34,443
That's what killed him.

434
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:36,138
Well, I wasn't
implying that your trial...

435
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:38,979
Let's focus on the living patients
and not the dead ones, okay?

436
00:16:44,621 --> 00:16:45,870
What'd you do?

437
00:16:45,939 --> 00:16:47,500
Nothing. I'm just irrigating.

438
00:16:47,524 --> 00:16:49,018
His temp spiked. CO2
levels are through the roof.

439
00:16:49,042 --> 00:16:50,652
Well, what's the
problem? He's tachycardic.

440
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,922
Increased heart rate.
Patient's burning up.

441
00:16:52,946 --> 00:16:55,379
I didn't use sux, but I
did use sevoflurane.

442
00:16:56,599 --> 00:16:57,982
Ice. We need ice.

443
00:16:58,051 --> 00:16:59,851
Wait. Now, this is my patient.

444
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:01,263
Run. Get ice, now.
Right away, Doctor.

445
00:17:01,287 --> 00:17:02,798
Kid's about to go
into organ failure.

446
00:17:02,822 --> 00:17:04,588
I'm pushing dantrolene.

447
00:17:04,657 --> 00:17:06,285
Let's get some cooling blankets.
- On it.

448
00:17:06,309 --> 00:17:08,570
And turn the thermostat
down in here as low as it will go.

449
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:10,327
Right away, Doctor.

450
00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:12,546
Oh, my God.
Malignant hyperthermia.

451
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:13,931
Where's that ice?

452
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,720
What do we got? Oh, good.

453
00:17:35,789 --> 00:17:39,290
I got a flail mitral valve
when I took her off bypass.

454
00:17:39,358 --> 00:17:40,908
Just put her back on

455
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:42,142
and cooled her down again.

456
00:17:42,211 --> 00:17:43,923
I need your hands. Okay.

457
00:17:43,947 --> 00:17:45,279
Oh, and, um,

458
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:48,365
thank you

459
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:49,434
for Henry.

460
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:52,820
I am so sorry that
we had to lie to you,

461
00:17:52,889 --> 00:17:55,789
but you were the only
one that I trusted to do it.

462
00:17:56,592 --> 00:17:58,092
You get it, right?

463
00:17:59,595 --> 00:18:00,628
Right.

464
00:18:00,697 --> 00:18:01,979
You're not mad at me?

465
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:06,584
No. No.

466
00:18:08,154 --> 00:18:09,453
Good. Okay.

467
00:18:09,521 --> 00:18:10,521
Go get scrubbed.

468
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:21,866
Gown me.

469
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:23,512
What did Altman
want? How's the patient?

470
00:18:23,536 --> 00:18:24,735
She'll be fine.

471
00:18:24,804 --> 00:18:26,599
Now that I put
Cristina in there.

472
00:18:26,623 --> 00:18:27,955
You...

473
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:29,267
You what? You put Yang
in the same OR with Teddy

474
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:30,986
with my patient on the table?

475
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:32,604
What the hell made you
think that was a good idea?

476
00:18:32,628 --> 00:18:34,928
I believe it was your
mistake that put everyone

477
00:18:34,997 --> 00:18:36,925
in this position
in the first place,

478
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:39,483
so you're really not one
to point fingers right now.

479
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:44,539
Catch me up.

480
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:46,351
I can't get visualization
of the mitral valve.

481
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,175
The left atrium's too small.

482
00:18:48,244 --> 00:18:50,344
What about superior
pulmonary vein exposure?

483
00:18:50,413 --> 00:18:52,830
Yes, good. Let's
do that. Scissors.

484
00:18:53,649 --> 00:18:55,432
What is she doing up there?

485
00:18:55,502 --> 00:18:56,767
Sorry?

486
00:18:56,836 --> 00:18:59,353
Kepner. She's been sitting
up there like a gargoyle.

487
00:18:59,421 --> 00:19:01,788
I thought there
was a big trauma.

488
00:19:02,758 --> 00:19:04,858
Oh, yeah. I don't know.

489
00:19:04,927 --> 00:19:08,529
Did you get a chance to
check on Henry post-op

490
00:19:08,598 --> 00:19:10,531
before I pulled you in here?

491
00:19:12,535 --> 00:19:14,001
I bet no one wanted her.

492
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,070
What?

493
00:19:15,138 --> 00:19:16,954
Kepner.

494
00:19:17,023 --> 00:19:20,324
<i>Probably because her
voice can peel paint off walls.</i>

495
00:19:20,393 --> 00:19:21,803
Charge to 200.

496
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,227
Clear!

497
00:19:23,296 --> 00:19:25,863
I mean, a trauma
is stressful enough.

498
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:27,381
Who needs that?

499
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:28,749
<i>You're horrible.</i>

500
00:19:28,817 --> 00:19:30,212
<i>Push 100 of lidocaine.</i>

501
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:32,870
Am I wrong?

502
00:19:32,939 --> 00:19:34,438
I'm right. Would you stop?

503
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:35,717
<i>- Stop it.
- Kind of.</i>

504
00:19:35,741 --> 00:19:37,141
<i>You agree with me. I can tell...</i>

505
00:19:37,192 --> 00:19:37,958
<i>- Would you stop?
- By your eyes.</i>

506
00:19:38,026 --> 00:19:39,243
<i>Okay, stop.</i>

507
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:42,524
<i>She's obviously
from the Midwest.</i>

508
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:43,947
How are they doing?

509
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,256
<i>Please stop it.</i>

510
00:19:45,318 --> 00:19:47,478
Still trying to
repair the valve.

511
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:49,887
Well, and making fun of me.

512
00:19:50,489 --> 00:19:52,089
What?

513
00:19:52,158 --> 00:19:54,370
Cristina doesn't want to
talk about Henry's surgery,

514
00:19:54,394 --> 00:19:56,376
so instead she's
making fun of me.

515
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:57,678
I'll turn off the intercom.

516
00:19:57,747 --> 00:19:59,530
No, it's...

517
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:01,932
I have to know
everything that's going on.

518
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:03,767
It's okay.

519
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:06,169
I can handle it.

520
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:13,611
Still bad visualization.

521
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,780
There is a lot of
unexpected fibrosis.

522
00:20:16,849 --> 00:20:19,761
We're just increasing our
chances of rupturing her heart.

523
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:22,380
We can't get in there. There's
too much tension on the walls.

524
00:20:22,404 --> 00:20:23,738
All right.

525
00:20:25,008 --> 00:20:27,174
We need to do this right.

526
00:20:27,243 --> 00:20:29,126
We're gonna do an ex vivo.

527
00:20:29,195 --> 00:20:31,628
You want to take the
heart out? Can we try to...

528
00:20:31,697 --> 00:20:33,630
Come on, Yang.

529
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:35,510
A cardiac autotransplantation

530
00:20:35,534 --> 00:20:38,035
for an ex vivo valve
reconstruction?

531
00:20:38,104 --> 00:20:40,583
If that's not on your
bucket list, it should be.

532
00:20:40,607 --> 00:20:41,767
Are you up for this?

533
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:45,142
You bet.

534
00:20:45,211 --> 00:20:46,844
Great. Okay.

535
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:50,297
We're gonna start with
the atria to explant the heart.

536
00:20:50,366 --> 00:20:53,033
And let's get some
music in here.

537
00:20:53,101 --> 00:20:54,813
What do you want
to listen to? You pick.

538
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:56,665
Let's get another
cooling blanket in here.

539
00:20:56,689 --> 00:20:57,900
Grey, let's repack this liver.

540
00:20:57,924 --> 00:20:59,356
Gelfoam. What's next?

541
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:01,036
We gave him dantrolene
to relax his muscles

542
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,687
and lidocaine to calm his heart.

543
00:21:02,711 --> 00:21:04,111
He's on ice inside and out.

544
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:07,331
Only thing left
to do now is wait.

545
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,711
All right. Well, settle in.

546
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:10,434
Could be a while.

547
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:15,789
Dr. Warren,

548
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:18,142
isn't malignant
hyperthermia genetic?

549
00:21:20,546 --> 00:21:21,695
You gotta go warn them...

550
00:21:21,764 --> 00:21:22,896
Already on it.

551
00:21:29,338 --> 00:21:31,005
How's she doing?

552
00:21:31,073 --> 00:21:32,734
She's a little full of
herself, if you ask me,

553
00:21:32,758 --> 00:21:34,353
but she's getting
the job done, I guess.

554
00:21:34,377 --> 00:21:36,093
No, the kid. Abby.

555
00:21:36,162 --> 00:21:38,412
You gotta watch her temp
if you gave her any sux

556
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,981
or inhalation anesthetics,
because our kid had a reaction.

557
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:43,200
Meredith, did you
get your stitches?

558
00:21:43,269 --> 00:21:45,018
I will. Fill them in.

559
00:21:46,773 --> 00:21:48,372
Pelvic stabilization's
not holding.

560
00:21:48,441 --> 00:21:49,918
Get me more lap pads. More.

561
00:21:49,942 --> 00:21:51,520
Do it. Yeah. I got that.
You need something?

562
00:21:51,544 --> 00:21:53,722
You haven't used any sux or
inhalation anesthetic, have you?

563
00:21:53,746 --> 00:21:54,907
'Cause our kid had a reaction.

564
00:21:54,931 --> 00:21:56,024
Damn it. This
hematoma's expanding.

565
00:21:56,048 --> 00:21:57,325
I'll occlude the internal iliac.

566
00:21:57,349 --> 00:21:58,676
Try and get some
temporary control.

567
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,061
All right. I need more
lap sponges here.

568
00:22:00,085 --> 00:22:01,485
Just watch his temp.

569
00:22:01,554 --> 00:22:04,054
We got it, Grey.
Thank you. Hemoclip.

570
00:22:04,123 --> 00:22:05,889
Yeah, hold it right over there.

571
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:07,224
Yep. Okay, one more. Come on.

572
00:22:07,293 --> 00:22:09,360
Let's pack it.

573
00:22:15,801 --> 00:22:17,278
His heart rate's coming down.

574
00:22:17,302 --> 00:22:19,583
His temperature's
starting to stabilize.

575
00:22:21,574 --> 00:22:24,369
Usually about the time you
realize it's malignant hyperthermia,

576
00:22:24,393 --> 00:22:25,692
it's too late.

577
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:27,127
That's a nice catch.

578
00:22:27,196 --> 00:22:30,247
You probably
saved this kid's life.

579
00:22:30,316 --> 00:22:32,728
Figured you didn't need another
patient dying on you today.

580
00:22:32,752 --> 00:22:33,851
So you did it for me?

581
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,502
Oh, yeah.

582
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:38,050
Any other doctor, I probably
wouldn't have said anything.

583
00:22:39,158 --> 00:22:41,625
It's freezing in here.

584
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:43,822
Well, why don't you
jump up and down?

585
00:22:43,846 --> 00:22:45,312
That'll warm you up.

586
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:46,947
I think I'll repair the liver.

587
00:22:47,016 --> 00:22:48,732
That'll warm me up. Suction.

588
00:22:54,089 --> 00:22:55,922
We have to go back in. What?

589
00:22:55,991 --> 00:22:59,443
On the baby. I forgot to place
the tension-free anastomosis.

590
00:22:59,511 --> 00:23:01,045
Do you hear me?
I forgot to place it.

591
00:23:01,114 --> 00:23:02,558
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa. Look at me.

592
00:23:02,582 --> 00:23:04,759
You did the anastomosis.
I watched you do it.

593
00:23:04,783 --> 00:23:06,127
You used the
double-layer technique.

594
00:23:06,151 --> 00:23:07,434
You remember?

595
00:23:08,671 --> 00:23:10,721
Okay. You need to sit down.

596
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:12,289
You need to sit down.

597
00:23:13,258 --> 00:23:14,575
You are overtired

598
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:17,177
and probably experiencing
some residual shock.

599
00:23:17,245 --> 00:23:19,057
And you're gonna
take a break this time,

600
00:23:19,081 --> 00:23:20,525
for real. Yeah, but...

601
00:23:20,549 --> 00:23:22,828
No. Don't argue with me, Karev.

602
00:23:22,852 --> 00:23:24,250
Deep breath.

603
00:23:28,524 --> 00:23:30,090
Beautiful.

604
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:31,792
Nice work.

605
00:23:31,861 --> 00:23:34,456
All right. Let's prepare
for re-implantation.

606
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,047
You know, you're
gonna think that I'm crazy,

607
00:23:37,116 --> 00:23:38,549
but there is this thing

608
00:23:38,617 --> 00:23:40,629
that we used to do in med school

609
00:23:40,653 --> 00:23:41,763
to try and stay awake.

610
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:44,254
And after this many
hours of surgery,

611
00:23:44,323 --> 00:23:45,756
you need to stay awake.

612
00:23:45,825 --> 00:23:47,241
I'm pretty awake, actually.

613
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:49,293
Whoo!

614
00:23:49,361 --> 00:23:50,944
Give me a "whoo!"

615
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:53,174
Whoo.

616
00:23:53,198 --> 00:23:56,033
Oh, come on. Give me a "whoo!"

617
00:23:57,103 --> 00:23:58,318
Whoo!

618
00:23:58,387 --> 00:24:00,504
That's not good. Come
on. You gotta wake up.

619
00:24:00,573 --> 00:24:01,672
Whoo!

620
00:24:02,591 --> 00:24:03,757
<i>Whoo!</i>

621
00:24:03,826 --> 00:24:05,642
<i>Okay, that's a little better.</i>

622
00:24:05,711 --> 00:24:07,631
<i>Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!</i>
They still going?

623
00:24:08,731 --> 00:24:10,163
What the hell are they doing?

624
00:24:10,233 --> 00:24:11,331
<i>Come on.</i>

625
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,917
I think they're having fun.

626
00:24:16,155 --> 00:24:17,371
<i>Whoo!</i>

627
00:24:28,334 --> 00:24:29,967
You gotta be okay.

628
00:24:30,036 --> 00:24:32,203
'Cause we need you right now.

629
00:24:32,271 --> 00:24:34,505
So if you can hear me,

630
00:24:34,573 --> 00:24:36,618
I'm sorry for being such
a jerk on the camping trip.

631
00:24:36,642 --> 00:24:38,409
I'll try to be better.

632
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:42,012
Just please wake up. You
gotta wake up, and I'll be nicer.

633
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,826
I'll help Michael with his
homework, and I'll babysit.

634
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:46,811
You won't even
have to pay me. Just...

635
00:24:46,835 --> 00:24:48,995
Please, Dad, just
open your eyes.

636
00:24:52,674 --> 00:24:54,008
Lilly,

637
00:24:54,076 --> 00:24:56,571
I just came to tell you that
your brother is out of surgery,

638
00:24:56,595 --> 00:24:58,028
and he's doing okay.

639
00:24:58,096 --> 00:24:59,362
And so is your sister.

640
00:24:59,431 --> 00:25:01,364
Okay. Okay?

641
00:25:03,052 --> 00:25:04,518
Can you

642
00:25:04,587 --> 00:25:07,654
make sure that nobody else
tells them about my mom?

643
00:25:09,191 --> 00:25:11,808
I should be the
one to tell them.

644
00:25:11,877 --> 00:25:13,343
Of course. Of course.

645
00:25:15,114 --> 00:25:16,213
He's coding!

646
00:25:17,967 --> 00:25:19,887
Push one of epi,
one of atropine.

647
00:25:23,272 --> 00:25:24,722
Charge paddles to 200.

648
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:26,285
Charging.

649
00:25:26,309 --> 00:25:28,058
Charged.

650
00:25:28,127 --> 00:25:29,727
Clear.

651
00:25:37,385 --> 00:25:40,554
<i>Cardio tech, trauma one.
Cardio tech, trauma one.</i>

652
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:43,457
They're almost finished.

653
00:25:43,526 --> 00:25:45,692
Now, they did have to take
her heart out of her body

654
00:25:45,778 --> 00:25:48,612
to repair the valve, but the
procedure went smoothly.

655
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,675
It's over. They're putting
the heart back in right now.

656
00:25:50,699 --> 00:25:52,266
It's good.

657
00:25:52,334 --> 00:25:53,684
It's good?

658
00:25:53,752 --> 00:25:56,603
My wife's body is in
pieces on some OR table,

659
00:25:56,672 --> 00:25:58,100
and you're telling
me that it's good?

660
00:25:58,124 --> 00:26:00,040
What is wrong
with you? I'm sorry.

661
00:26:00,109 --> 00:26:01,592
I didn't... Dad?

662
00:26:01,661 --> 00:26:03,493
Hey, my man. I'm here.

663
00:26:03,563 --> 00:26:05,844
Go back to sleep. Okay, buddy?

664
00:26:16,025 --> 00:26:17,241
Ow!

665
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:19,643
I thought peds surgeons
were supposed to be gentle.

666
00:26:19,711 --> 00:26:22,179
Yeah. You look like
hell. You should go home.

667
00:26:22,248 --> 00:26:25,299
Me? You smell bad. You go home.

668
00:26:25,367 --> 00:26:26,545
How's the baby?

669
00:26:26,569 --> 00:26:28,969
Good. Actually, really good.

670
00:26:29,038 --> 00:26:30,487
How are the other kids?

671
00:26:30,555 --> 00:26:32,275
Well, the oldest
daughter, I mean,

672
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,791
she watched her mother die,
now her father keeps coding,

673
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:37,260
and she won't leave his side.

674
00:26:38,897 --> 00:26:40,631
Daddy? Daddy!

675
00:26:42,485 --> 00:26:43,700
Dad, please.

676
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:44,635
Lilly, I'm sorry.
You can't be in here.

677
00:26:44,703 --> 00:26:45,864
Wait. Wait.

678
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:47,808
Charge the paddles to
300. WOMAN: Charging.

679
00:26:48,457 --> 00:26:49,522
Charged.

680
00:26:50,492 --> 00:26:52,226
Clear.

681
00:26:52,294 --> 00:26:53,422
I was paged. Code blue?

682
00:26:53,446 --> 00:26:54,622
He keeps going into V-fib.

683
00:26:54,646 --> 00:26:56,180
Okay, let's start compressions.

684
00:26:57,466 --> 00:26:59,432
Lilly, you can't be in here.

685
00:26:59,501 --> 00:27:00,578
She can't see this again.

686
00:27:00,602 --> 00:27:01,685
Come on. Let's go.

687
00:27:01,754 --> 00:27:02,897
No, I'm not leaving.
I'm not gonna leave.

688
00:27:02,921 --> 00:27:04,432
Meredith. Lilly, please.

689
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:06,840
Stop it! It's my dad. Please.
I have a right to be here,

690
00:27:06,908 --> 00:27:07,970
and I'm not gonna leave him.

691
00:27:07,994 --> 00:27:09,426
Charge again. Clear.

692
00:27:12,632 --> 00:27:14,147
Come on.

693
00:27:15,734 --> 00:27:18,818
All right. That's
the last suture.

694
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:20,854
In that case, gentlemen,

695
00:27:20,922 --> 00:27:21,962
I am all done.

696
00:27:22,008 --> 00:27:23,035
Nice work, Dr. Canner.

697
00:27:23,059 --> 00:27:24,658
It was a pleasure, Dr. Shepherd.

698
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:26,671
All right. I can trust
you two to finish this?

699
00:27:26,695 --> 00:27:28,490
You're not gonna ruin all
the good work I just did?

700
00:27:28,514 --> 00:27:30,648
Well, I wouldn't bet on it.

701
00:27:30,716 --> 00:27:32,016
Follow me out, Dr. Grey.

702
00:27:32,084 --> 00:27:33,478
I need to talk to
you for a second.

703
00:27:33,502 --> 00:27:35,084
Me? Why?

704
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:37,487
I mean, of course, if you...

705
00:27:37,556 --> 00:27:39,756
Don't worry. I'm not
gonna throw a ball at you.

706
00:27:39,825 --> 00:27:41,858
It's about her
post-op instructions.

707
00:27:44,513 --> 00:27:46,946
Her eye needs to
be covered 24/7.

708
00:27:47,015 --> 00:27:48,526
She can watch TV all she wants,

709
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:50,928
but she can't read a book
for the first three days.

710
00:27:52,505 --> 00:27:53,705
Whoa!

711
00:27:54,607 --> 00:27:56,206
Okay.

712
00:27:56,274 --> 00:27:59,142
Oh, thank God that is over.
Did I seem nervous in there?

713
00:27:59,211 --> 00:28:00,421
Just be honest with me.

714
00:28:00,445 --> 00:28:02,479
You seemed more than okay.

715
00:28:02,548 --> 00:28:04,192
That is Derek Shepherd in there,

716
00:28:04,216 --> 00:28:06,394
one of the best
neurosurgeons in the country

717
00:28:06,418 --> 00:28:08,151
and Mark's best friend.

718
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:10,048
And the whole time I was in
there, all I could think about

719
00:28:10,072 --> 00:28:12,267
was my high school
cross-country team.

720
00:28:12,291 --> 00:28:14,036
Coach would always
say, "Don't look back,

721
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:16,071
"never look back, because if
the kid behind you sees that,

722
00:28:16,095 --> 00:28:18,240
"he knows you're weak,
and he will run you down."

723
00:28:18,264 --> 00:28:21,176
The whole surgery, that's
all I was thinking about.

724
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,882
Don't look back.

725
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:24,651
Well, you didn't.

726
00:28:24,719 --> 00:28:26,119
Thanks.

727
00:28:26,755 --> 00:28:27,887
Yeah.

728
00:28:29,224 --> 00:28:31,090
Thank you, Dr. Grey.

729
00:28:36,331 --> 00:28:38,098
Damn it.

730
00:28:38,167 --> 00:28:39,732
Now I like her.

731
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:50,777
That's, like, the fourth time
you've had to revive him today.

732
00:28:50,845 --> 00:28:52,045
Is that normal?

733
00:28:52,114 --> 00:28:54,314
His body has been through a lot.

734
00:28:56,502 --> 00:28:58,351
What are those tubes for?

735
00:28:58,437 --> 00:29:00,670
His body is filling with fluid,

736
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:02,984
and those tubes are draining it.

737
00:29:03,008 --> 00:29:08,011
And that thing
that's making noise?

738
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,930
It's a ventilator. It's
breathing for him.

739
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:13,600
Is he gonna wake up?

740
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:15,519
You can tell me. I can take it.

741
00:29:16,522 --> 00:29:17,665
I have no way to know that.

742
00:29:17,689 --> 00:29:19,206
What do you know?

743
00:29:19,291 --> 00:29:22,126
I know that we haven't been able

744
00:29:22,194 --> 00:29:24,961
to take him off
of the life support.

745
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:27,814
And I know that it's
very hard on his body

746
00:29:27,882 --> 00:29:30,550
every time we
try and revive him,

747
00:29:30,636 --> 00:29:34,221
and that it's taking longer
and longer each time we try.

748
00:29:36,258 --> 00:29:39,142
And his kidney
tests are elevated.

749
00:29:39,211 --> 00:29:41,778
Which means what?

750
00:29:41,847 --> 00:29:43,313
Which means that

751
00:29:43,382 --> 00:29:46,383
his organs are starting
to fail, one by one.

752
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:51,455
You asked me about
extraordinary measures before,

753
00:29:51,523 --> 00:29:53,283
if my parents ever
talked to me about them.

754
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:58,161
What you're doing
to my dad, are those...

755
00:29:58,230 --> 00:29:59,470
They are.

756
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,100
I think you should stop.

757
00:30:06,855 --> 00:30:09,022
It's not that simple.

758
00:30:09,691 --> 00:30:11,491
And it's not your call.

759
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:12,770
You're his child.

760
00:30:12,794 --> 00:30:15,896
I'm not a child, not anymore.

761
00:30:15,964 --> 00:30:18,531
I turned 18 four hours ago.

762
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,383
Today is my birthday.

763
00:30:20,452 --> 00:30:24,354
And I've watched you
torture my dad for the past six.

764
00:30:24,422 --> 00:30:27,224
So I'm the head
of the family now,

765
00:30:27,292 --> 00:30:29,159
and it's my job.

766
00:30:30,229 --> 00:30:32,162
If you take him off the machines

767
00:30:32,231 --> 00:30:33,613
and he lives, then he lives.

768
00:30:34,466 --> 00:30:36,700
But if you don't,

769
00:30:36,769 --> 00:30:38,902
then at least we
let him go in peace.

770
00:30:40,388 --> 00:30:42,456
You gotta stop.

771
00:30:42,524 --> 00:30:43,623
Please.

772
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:52,132
Okay, time to close.

773
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,444
Would you like to do the honors?

774
00:30:53,468 --> 00:30:54,551
Kepner can close.

775
00:30:54,619 --> 00:30:55,619
What?

776
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:57,537
<i>Kepner, can you close?</i>

777
00:30:57,606 --> 00:30:59,556
<i>Uh, I can, but...</i> Yang.

778
00:30:59,624 --> 00:31:01,208
<i>Kepner, close.</i>

779
00:31:02,244 --> 00:31:03,287
Cristina...

780
00:31:03,311 --> 00:31:05,045
Can I speak to you
privately, please?

781
00:31:19,327 --> 00:31:21,328
What's up? You okay?

782
00:31:22,831 --> 00:31:25,031
When we brought your
husband into the OR,

783
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:26,478
we originally thought
we could go in

784
00:31:26,502 --> 00:31:28,301
with a bronchoscope and a laser,

785
00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:30,420
however, there
was a lot of bleeding,

786
00:31:30,488 --> 00:31:32,155
so we had to open him up.

787
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:34,435
Wait. You... Wait.
No. Owen said that...

788
00:31:34,459 --> 00:31:35,758
When we opened him up,

789
00:31:35,827 --> 00:31:38,612
we saw that his tumor had
eroded his pulmonary artery.

790
00:31:40,316 --> 00:31:43,100
Dr. Webber and I both used
extraordinary measures...

791
00:31:43,168 --> 00:31:44,634
No. But we...

792
00:31:44,703 --> 00:31:45,814
No, no. No.

793
00:31:45,838 --> 00:31:47,504
We used extraordinary measures,

794
00:31:47,573 --> 00:31:49,233
but his heart could not
tolerate the excessive bleeding.

795
00:31:49,257 --> 00:31:50,873
No.

796
00:31:50,943 --> 00:31:53,863
He did not survive
the surgery. I'm sorry.

797
00:32:01,269 --> 00:32:02,703
You're saying...

798
00:32:07,209 --> 00:32:09,409
You're saying he's dead.

799
00:32:09,477 --> 00:32:10,610
Yes.

800
00:32:15,317 --> 00:32:16,850
Say it.

801
00:32:17,986 --> 00:32:19,151
Teddy...

802
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:20,665
When you inform the
family, you have to say it

803
00:32:20,689 --> 00:32:22,317
so that they know that
it's really happening.

804
00:32:22,341 --> 00:32:24,875
It's the first thing
that you're taught.

805
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:27,410
I never really
thought about it...

806
00:32:27,479 --> 00:32:30,013
But now I get it, and...

807
00:32:32,217 --> 00:32:33,883
Cristina,

808
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:37,054
I need you...

809
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:39,556
I need you to say it.

810
00:32:43,345 --> 00:32:44,845
Henry is dead.

811
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,673
Thank you.

812
00:33:21,633 --> 00:33:23,066
Where's Teddy?

813
00:33:24,336 --> 00:33:25,969
I don't know.

814
00:33:26,037 --> 00:33:27,203
Wait.

815
00:33:27,823 --> 00:33:29,489
You told her?

816
00:33:29,558 --> 00:33:30,823
Of course I did.

817
00:33:32,394 --> 00:33:34,205
You should have let me.
I should've been the one.

818
00:33:34,229 --> 00:33:37,113
Oh, my God. This is not about
you. Who cares who told her?

819
00:33:37,182 --> 00:33:38,948
Okay, I told her,

820
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:41,029
because you made me
stand there and talk and joke

821
00:33:41,053 --> 00:33:43,286
and lie to her for hours,

822
00:33:43,338 --> 00:33:44,353
for hours.

823
00:33:44,422 --> 00:33:46,023
I am sorry. I had to.

824
00:33:46,091 --> 00:33:48,625
No, I know, I don't wanna...

825
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:50,727
I don't wanna hear it.

826
00:33:53,132 --> 00:33:54,697
And neither will she.

827
00:34:08,062 --> 00:34:09,862
Give me the chart.

828
00:34:11,133 --> 00:34:12,181
Uh...

829
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:14,050
Just give me the chart.

830
00:34:17,756 --> 00:34:19,288
Thank you.

831
00:34:19,925 --> 00:34:21,657
Get out.

832
00:36:12,304 --> 00:36:14,403
I'll give you your privacy.

833
00:36:18,393 --> 00:36:20,860
So what happens now?

834
00:36:22,764 --> 00:36:25,598
His heart rate will slow down,

835
00:36:25,667 --> 00:36:27,611
and that's gonna
make the alarm sound,

836
00:36:27,635 --> 00:36:30,603
but I can turn the sound off.

837
00:36:30,672 --> 00:36:35,708
And then his breathing is
going to get slower and slower.

838
00:36:35,777 --> 00:36:38,511
And then his
organs will start to fail

839
00:36:38,579 --> 00:36:41,881
because they need
oxygen to survive.

840
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:44,228
And then when there's
no breathing and no pulse,

841
00:36:44,252 --> 00:36:45,412
that's when he's gone.

842
00:36:53,011 --> 00:36:54,377
Is this it?

843
00:36:54,446 --> 00:36:56,011
This is it, sweetie.

844
00:36:58,299 --> 00:36:59,849
I'll wait outside.

845
00:37:01,653 --> 00:37:03,819
No, please.

846
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:04,888
Please wait.

847
00:37:04,956 --> 00:37:06,196
Okay, okay.

848
00:37:21,423 --> 00:37:23,656
I really should be
taking the fall for this.

849
00:37:23,725 --> 00:37:25,091
I agree.

850
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:26,370
All right. Well, then I'm
just gonna walk in there

851
00:37:26,394 --> 00:37:27,961
and I'm gonna tell him.

852
00:37:28,029 --> 00:37:30,630
Look, let me spell
it out for you, Avery.

853
00:37:30,699 --> 00:37:31,881
This is on me.

854
00:37:31,949 --> 00:37:33,783
Yes, it was your mistake,

855
00:37:33,851 --> 00:37:35,195
and, yes, you
should feel like crap,

856
00:37:35,219 --> 00:37:36,764
but I'm your attending,
you're a fifth year,

857
00:37:36,788 --> 00:37:40,222
which means that I'm responsible
for what happens in my OR,

858
00:37:40,292 --> 00:37:42,136
and you get a free ride.
Well, I don't want a free ride.

859
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,344
Well, I don't want to
give it to you, but I will,

860
00:37:44,412 --> 00:37:47,647
because you're still
young and inexperienced,

861
00:37:47,716 --> 00:37:49,582
and hopefully, you'll
learn something here.

862
00:37:49,651 --> 00:37:51,228
You'll start
double-checking your work,

863
00:37:51,252 --> 00:37:52,997
and the work of your
residents when the time comes,

864
00:37:53,021 --> 00:37:54,315
because otherwise, you'll be me,

865
00:37:54,339 --> 00:37:56,473
walking in to apologize
to a family that hates me

866
00:37:56,541 --> 00:37:58,374
almost as much as I
hate myself right now.

867
00:38:02,981 --> 00:38:04,847
Dr. Torres, there you are.

868
00:38:04,916 --> 00:38:06,082
I need to talk to you.

869
00:38:06,151 --> 00:38:08,801
I know. I know, Mr. Lewis.
I want to talk, too.

870
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:12,571
Yeah, you owe me an explanation.

871
00:38:13,591 --> 00:38:16,492
Okay? A real explanation.

872
00:38:16,561 --> 00:38:19,178
What happened to Laura,
this is totally unacceptable.

873
00:38:20,181 --> 00:38:21,564
I understand.

874
00:38:26,354 --> 00:38:30,023
I was rude to you before
when you mentioned Henry.

875
00:38:31,326 --> 00:38:33,059
I'm used to it.

876
00:38:33,128 --> 00:38:35,011
It's kinda your thing.

877
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:38,076
Look, when bad things
happen to you, you lash out.

878
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:40,349
You want space.

879
00:38:40,418 --> 00:38:43,202
That's why I'm sitting way
over here at my own table.

880
00:38:44,272 --> 00:38:46,105
I'm giving you space.

881
00:38:47,642 --> 00:38:49,708
I didn't just lose
a patient today.

882
00:38:49,778 --> 00:38:51,710
I lost a friend.

883
00:38:54,933 --> 00:38:56,933
I'm sorry.

884
00:38:59,888 --> 00:39:02,222
I wouldn't mind if

885
00:39:03,458 --> 00:39:05,875
you didn't give me
quite so much space.

886
00:39:43,297 --> 00:39:44,530
Canner did a good job.

887
00:39:44,599 --> 00:39:45,776
Yeah, she did.

888
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,280
Don't screw this
one up. I like her.

889
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:48,935
She's a keeper.

890
00:39:56,744 --> 00:39:59,584
I'll be close by if you need me.

891
00:40:02,867 --> 00:40:05,507
<i>You can't prepare
for a sudden impact.</i>

892
00:40:07,072 --> 00:40:09,272
<i>You can't brace yourself.</i>

893
00:40:09,341 --> 00:40:11,190
<i>It just hits you</i>

894
00:40:11,259 --> 00:40:12,859
<i>out of nowhere.</i>

895
00:40:12,927 --> 00:40:14,527
<i>And suddenly</i>

896
00:40:14,596 --> 00:40:16,529
<i>the life you knew before</i>

897
00:40:17,032 --> 00:40:19,165
<i>is over</i>

898
00:40:19,234 --> 00:40:20,433
<i>forever.</i>

899
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:29,608
Oh!

900
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:31,489
What's wrong? There's
no food, and I'm hungry.

901
00:40:31,513 --> 00:40:33,229
I just ordered pizza.

902
00:40:33,297 --> 00:40:34,430
For breakfast?

903
00:40:34,499 --> 00:40:36,110
We've been up for
39 straight hours.

904
00:40:36,134 --> 00:40:38,751
It's dinner. It's a
very, very late dinner.

905
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,137
That cheese is old.

906
00:40:41,205 --> 00:40:42,555
I'm hungry. I might die.

907
00:40:42,623 --> 00:40:44,902
Don't eat the old cheese.
Come and sit down by me.

908
00:40:44,926 --> 00:40:46,166
Put your head down.

909
00:40:54,786 --> 00:40:56,847
I'd like to put a little salt
on your nose and eat a bite.

910
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:59,311
The pizza will be
here any minute.

911
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:00,889
Mmm-hmm.

912
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:05,161
We'll be okay.

913
00:41:06,364 --> 00:41:08,280
If it's just the two of us.

914
00:41:08,349 --> 00:41:09,560
If that's what you want.

915
00:41:09,584 --> 00:41:10,917
I love you.

916
00:41:15,841 --> 00:41:16,989
Pizza.

917
00:41:20,195 --> 00:41:22,395
Don't start eating
that pizza without me.

918
00:41:30,254 --> 00:41:31,837
Meredith?

919
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:32,906
Derek.

920
00:41:32,974 --> 00:41:33,974
Yes?

921
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:36,275
Is that our baby?

922
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:39,412
Yes.

923
00:41:41,049 --> 00:41:42,882
Yes, it is.

924
00:41:48,006 --> 00:41:49,605
She's yours.

925
00:42:03,838 --> 00:42:05,905
Hi. Hi, come here.

926
00:42:05,974 --> 00:42:06,989
Hi.

927
00:42:07,892 --> 00:42:09,092
Hi.
