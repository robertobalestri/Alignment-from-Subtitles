1
00:00:02,936 --> 00:00:04,347
That's it, Fran. One more push.

2
00:00:04,371 --> 00:00:06,638
<i>As babies, we were easy.</i>

3
00:00:06,707 --> 00:00:08,435
<i>One cry meant you were hungry...</i>

4
00:00:08,459 --> 00:00:09,969
It's a boy.

5
00:00:09,993 --> 00:00:11,876
How is he? Is he okay?

6
00:00:11,945 --> 00:00:13,445
<i>Another, you were tired.</i>

7
00:00:14,297 --> 00:00:15,457
He's perfect.

8
00:00:25,375 --> 00:00:28,510
<i>It's only as adults that
we become difficult.</i>

9
00:00:28,578 --> 00:00:31,018
Hey, wake up, pretty lady.

10
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:33,515
Mmm.

11
00:00:34,384 --> 00:00:35,483
Morning.

12
00:00:35,552 --> 00:00:37,552
It's gonna be a great morning.

13
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:39,655
We made you eggs benedict.

14
00:00:39,723 --> 00:00:40,789
Where's Sofia?

15
00:00:40,858 --> 00:00:42,636
Napping. Ooh! Try the eggs.

16
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:44,700
The bacon is jalapeno-infused.

17
00:00:44,745 --> 00:00:47,662
Tomorrow we're making
short ribs infused with cabernet.

18
00:00:47,748 --> 00:00:49,847
I just want coffee
infused with cream.

19
00:00:49,917 --> 00:00:51,361
No, yeah, but just
try the hollandaise.

20
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:53,163
I have to get ready. I
have a big surgery...

21
00:00:53,187 --> 00:00:55,282
Hold on. So I...

22
00:00:55,306 --> 00:00:56,566
Mmm. I'm so sorry.

23
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:58,924
<i>We start to hide our feelings,</i>

24
00:00:58,992 --> 00:01:00,526
<i>put up walls.</i>

25
00:01:06,434 --> 00:01:08,617
<i>It gets to the point where
we never really know</i>

26
00:01:08,685 --> 00:01:09,925
<i>how anyone thinks or feels.</i>

27
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:10,970
What?

28
00:01:11,038 --> 00:01:12,137
My key's not working.

29
00:01:12,206 --> 00:01:13,316
Yes, because I
changed the locks.

30
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:14,340
Oh, come on!

31
00:01:14,391 --> 00:01:16,158
Yes, this isn't my trial,

32
00:01:16,226 --> 00:01:17,921
but that doesn't mean you can
lock me out of my own mouse lab.

33
00:01:17,945 --> 00:01:19,177
My mouse lab.

34
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:20,595
Bailey, don't...

35
00:01:20,664 --> 00:01:24,265
<i>Without meaning to, we
become masters of disguise.</i>

36
00:01:26,269 --> 00:01:28,036
Q's hyperglycemic, too.

37
00:01:29,907 --> 00:01:32,152
Which means that about
20% of the mice with implants

38
00:01:32,176 --> 00:01:33,541
have diabetes again.

39
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:35,254
Look, we should
really tell Dr. Webber.

40
00:01:35,278 --> 00:01:36,595
No, we are not telling him.

41
00:01:36,664 --> 00:01:38,480
Well, okay, but...

42
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:40,460
Kepner, it is precisely
because of challenges like this

43
00:01:40,484 --> 00:01:42,384
that I handpicked
you for this trial.

44
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:43,902
You handpicked me because

45
00:01:43,971 --> 00:01:45,682
Cristina, Alex, and
Jackson all said no.

46
00:01:45,706 --> 00:01:47,839
And because you
go above and beyond.

47
00:01:47,908 --> 00:01:49,808
Look, you solve problems
like no one else can.

48
00:01:49,876 --> 00:01:50,926
Say it with me.

49
00:01:51,011 --> 00:01:53,011
I solve problems...

50
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,690
Like no one else can.
Like no one else can.

51
00:01:54,714 --> 00:01:57,716
Exactly. Now let's get to work.

52
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:00,197
Fifth year is the hardest
year of your residency.

53
00:02:00,221 --> 00:02:03,088
Every surgery you do
will go on your record,

54
00:02:03,157 --> 00:02:05,039
the wins and the losses.

55
00:02:05,108 --> 00:02:06,252
In just a few
months, you will...

56
00:02:06,276 --> 00:02:07,353
What did I miss?

57
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:08,743
You're OB now?

58
00:02:08,812 --> 00:02:10,757
Oh, how the mighty
have fallen, huh?

59
00:02:10,781 --> 00:02:12,964
She misses Zola.
Her uterus hurts.

60
00:02:13,033 --> 00:02:14,782
Oh, leave her alone, dirtbag.

61
00:02:14,851 --> 00:02:16,646
Of the more complicated
surgeries you've scrubbed in.

62
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:17,835
You are embarrassing me.

63
00:02:17,904 --> 00:02:19,249
I'm getting to deliver babies.

64
00:02:19,273 --> 00:02:20,549
I'm making life, you know?

65
00:02:20,573 --> 00:02:22,468
Yeah, you know what?
You're making me gag.

66
00:02:22,492 --> 00:02:27,495
Okay, slumming it in OB for a
few weeks is okay. Whatever.

67
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:30,932
But wearing the vagina
squad scrubs in public? Ugh!

68
00:02:31,001 --> 00:02:32,378
We have standards, Meredith.

69
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:34,397
It is extremely important
that you rack up

70
00:02:34,421 --> 00:02:37,923
as many good outcomes
as possible for your boards.

71
00:02:37,992 --> 00:02:39,674
I am implementing a system.

72
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:42,276
I will receive an e-mail
if any of you exceed

73
00:02:42,345 --> 00:02:45,013
more than 10 bad
outcomes in your OR.

74
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:46,993
Ten. Any more is unacceptable.

75
00:02:47,017 --> 00:02:48,383
Welcome, Dr. Kepner.

76
00:02:48,452 --> 00:02:50,013
Sorry. I got stuck in
the lab with Bailey.

77
00:02:50,037 --> 00:02:51,369
I don't care where you were.

78
00:02:51,438 --> 00:02:53,558
I care that you
already have, let's see,

79
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,507
two bad outcomes in your OR.

80
00:02:55,576 --> 00:02:56,608
Ooh!

81
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:57,826
Loser.

82
00:02:59,145 --> 00:03:00,512
Of course that's nothing

83
00:03:00,581 --> 00:03:03,698
compared to Karev's
impressive five bad outcomes.

84
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:05,016
Oh!

85
00:03:05,085 --> 00:03:06,285
I keep getting dud patients.

86
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:07,998
Tell it to your board examiners.

87
00:03:08,022 --> 00:03:11,462
The point, people, is to keep
your bad outcomes to a minimum,

88
00:03:11,492 --> 00:03:14,587
or you will be hard-pressed
to find a fellowship next year.

89
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:16,210
Who are you texting?

90
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:17,478
Who do you think?

91
00:03:21,651 --> 00:03:25,453
Uh, Dr. Yang, are you sure
that you're getting all this down?

92
00:03:25,522 --> 00:03:26,955
Mmm-hmm.

93
00:03:27,024 --> 00:03:28,473
Bad outcomes are bad,

94
00:03:28,525 --> 00:03:30,291
which is why I have zero so far,

95
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,110
a perfect record
I plan to continue

96
00:03:32,178 --> 00:03:33,879
during my ortho
rotation this week.

97
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:36,698
No one dies during
a hip replacement.

98
00:03:36,766 --> 00:03:38,300
Let's hope.

99
00:03:38,369 --> 00:03:40,197
I'm sorry. I will make
sure that the scrub nurse

100
00:03:40,221 --> 00:03:42,365
separates your
macrodissectors from your micros.

101
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:44,651
I told her that yesterday,
but she must have forgotten,

102
00:03:44,675 --> 00:03:46,552
which I know sounds
like an excuse,

103
00:03:46,576 --> 00:03:47,887
and I am sorry for that, too...

104
00:03:47,911 --> 00:03:48,988
Lexie. Yes.

105
00:03:49,012 --> 00:03:50,428
Leave. Now.

106
00:03:51,348 --> 00:03:52,764
Okay.

107
00:03:54,368 --> 00:03:56,668
Hey. Can you go have sex
with him and make him be nicer?

108
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:58,448
I told you, he's going
to be hard on you

109
00:03:58,472 --> 00:04:00,149
until you learn
all of his quirks.

110
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:01,673
They're not quirks.

111
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:04,409
They're these scary, nitpicky
rules just to drive me crazy.

112
00:04:04,478 --> 00:04:07,128
Like what is the deal with him
needing 16 towels in the OR.

113
00:04:07,197 --> 00:04:08,429
At all times?

114
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:10,010
Well, if I give you
all the answers,

115
00:04:10,034 --> 00:04:11,511
you'll never learn on your own.

116
00:04:11,535 --> 00:04:13,468
You're just as mean as he is.

117
00:04:14,888 --> 00:04:16,371
Hi. How's your day going?

118
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:20,175
Bad. My OR is a mess, my
caseload is an exercise in boring.

119
00:04:20,244 --> 00:04:23,422
Which you can't tell me
because we can't talk about neuro.

120
00:04:23,446 --> 00:04:24,779
Right.

121
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:27,882
I know something
else we can do instead.

122
00:04:27,951 --> 00:04:29,684
No kissing in the hospital.

123
00:04:29,753 --> 00:04:31,353
Why not?

124
00:04:31,421 --> 00:04:33,661
We don't work together
anymore. You're just my wife.

125
00:04:33,707 --> 00:04:35,619
Ooh!

126
00:04:35,643 --> 00:04:36,925
9-1-1.

127
00:04:36,994 --> 00:04:38,226
Wait.

128
00:04:38,295 --> 00:04:39,728
Okay. Now you can go.

129
00:04:42,966 --> 00:04:45,545
I should be grateful that
they're getting along, right?

130
00:04:45,569 --> 00:04:47,580
But I'm not, though. I'm bitter.

131
00:04:47,604 --> 00:04:50,433
All they do is cook together and
talk about food and watch shows

132
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:52,623
where other people
talk about food and...

133
00:04:54,244 --> 00:04:56,144
Don't read that.

134
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:58,474
"I'll bend you over the
conference room table and..." Oh!

135
00:04:58,498 --> 00:04:59,609
Okay, why did you
let me read that?

136
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:01,277
My husband can't
get enough of me.

137
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,333
Jealous?

138
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:03,802
Yes, actually.

139
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:06,538
Arizona and I haven't had
much "alone time" lately,

140
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:07,906
and so instead, we eat.

141
00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:09,223
Oh, that's depressing.

142
00:05:09,292 --> 00:05:10,370
Yeah, let's just
talk about the case.

143
00:05:10,394 --> 00:05:11,704
Okay. What is it? Okay.

144
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:14,006
Hip replacement,
shoulder dislocation? Ha!

145
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:15,975
This is your first time
copiloting with me.

146
00:05:15,999 --> 00:05:19,239
You think I'm gonna
bore you with routine crap?

147
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:23,199
My feet hurt!

148
00:05:23,223 --> 00:05:25,156
Mr. and Mrs. Moser? Hi.

149
00:05:25,225 --> 00:05:26,674
Hi. Sorry.

150
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:29,060
My lazy sack husband
thinks that this is his bed.

151
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:30,312
It's not?

152
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:32,258
No, this is our
patient's parents. Yeah.

153
00:05:32,282 --> 00:05:33,810
This is Dr. Yang. She's
my co-surgeon on the case.

154
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:35,784
Oh, so nice to meet you.

155
00:05:37,721 --> 00:05:39,054
Get up!

156
00:05:39,123 --> 00:05:40,516
Come on. Pretend you
have manners for a second.

157
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,018
What, the kind of
manners that allow you

158
00:05:42,042 --> 00:05:43,820
to insult your husband
in front of strangers?

159
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:46,204
Stop it. TYLER: Stop fighting.

160
00:05:46,313 --> 00:05:48,046
You're scaring the doctors.

161
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:49,464
Hi. Tyler.

162
00:05:49,532 --> 00:05:52,049
I'm... I'm not staring
at your boobs.

163
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:54,230
I mean, I am,
but I can't help it.

164
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,568
Tyler suffers from a
degenerative bone disease

165
00:05:58,592 --> 00:06:00,242
called cervical spondylosis.

166
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:01,704
He was in a car
accident two years ago,

167
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:03,008
which further injured his neck,

168
00:06:03,063 --> 00:06:05,013
and so we are gonna
build him a new one

169
00:06:05,082 --> 00:06:06,681
in a three-day,
three-part surgery.

170
00:06:07,517 --> 00:06:09,584
Do not point that camera at me!

171
00:06:09,653 --> 00:06:11,893
You look beautiful, sweetie.

172
00:06:12,889 --> 00:06:15,123
Oh, are you the
OB? Drugs, please.

173
00:06:15,191 --> 00:06:16,286
Where's the attending?

174
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,759
She's stuck in an emergency C.

175
00:06:17,828 --> 00:06:19,122
They were driving home to
Olympia when her water broke.

176
00:06:19,146 --> 00:06:20,228
She's two weeks early.

177
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:21,613
Hi, Mary. I'm Dr. Grey.

178
00:06:21,682 --> 00:06:23,602
I don't care who you
are, just give me drugs.

179
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:25,044
Okay, let's see if
we have time for that.

180
00:06:25,068 --> 00:06:26,129
Over here, honey.

181
00:06:26,153 --> 00:06:27,196
Wow. You're crowning.

182
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,454
Wow? Did you just say "wow"?

183
00:06:29,523 --> 00:06:30,850
This is it. It's all happening.

184
00:06:32,009 --> 00:06:33,308
Clay, I swear to God,

185
00:06:33,376 --> 00:06:35,527
if you don't point that
camera someplace else!

186
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:37,462
Oh, God!

187
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,025
Are you pushing? She
shouldn't push, right?

188
00:06:39,049 --> 00:06:40,510
Just give me a second.

189
00:06:40,534 --> 00:06:41,844
Look over here.
I'll distract you.

190
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:43,835
Brain tumor! Brain tumor.

191
00:06:43,887 --> 00:06:46,003
I call brain tumor
on the video camera!

192
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,716
You can't call brain
tumor right now.

193
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,674
It's my tumor. I make the rules.

194
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:51,186
Brain tumor?
Nobody said anything.

195
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:52,672
She has a grade IV astrocytoma.

196
00:06:52,696 --> 00:06:53,990
You could have led with that.

197
00:06:54,014 --> 00:06:55,175
It's been a little hectic.

198
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,716
Oh!

199
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:01,018
Head.

200
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:15,317
Hi, Emma.

201
00:07:16,253 --> 00:07:17,785
Sweet little girl.

202
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:19,365
It's called a butterfly tumor

203
00:07:19,389 --> 00:07:21,017
because it extends into
both sides of the brain.

204
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:22,252
She has about six months.

205
00:07:22,276 --> 00:07:24,209
She's dying, so they
decided to have a baby?

206
00:07:24,278 --> 00:07:25,744
Well, that's not the point.

207
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:27,973
So I had St. Catherine's
send over all her scans,

208
00:07:27,997 --> 00:07:29,809
and I want you to
take them to Derek

209
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:31,298
and get him to do a consult.

210
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:33,462
Derek hates me. You are
better off taking them yourself.

211
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:34,731
The only thing holding
our marriage together

212
00:07:34,755 --> 00:07:36,382
is that we can't
talk about neuro,

213
00:07:36,406 --> 00:07:38,050
so he can't know that I
had anything to do with this.

214
00:07:38,074 --> 00:07:40,474
So you're using me?
I'm your tumor mule?

215
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,105
Do you want him to
stop yelling at you?

216
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:43,728
He needs to be inspired.

217
00:07:51,788 --> 00:07:53,248
Hey, Karev, trade with me.

218
00:07:53,272 --> 00:07:54,383
Ortho for cardio.

219
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:56,051
I mean, you need a good outcome,

220
00:07:56,075 --> 00:07:57,687
and I'm just doing a stupid
neck surgery with Callie.

221
00:07:57,711 --> 00:07:59,777
There's no such thing
as a stupid neck surgery.

222
00:07:59,846 --> 00:08:01,624
You're just afraid of
tanking your winning streak,

223
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:03,381
so now you want
back on the easy train.

224
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:04,682
Not happening.

225
00:08:04,751 --> 00:08:06,217
What easy train?

226
00:08:06,285 --> 00:08:08,330
That's what Dr. Karev
calls your service.

227
00:08:08,354 --> 00:08:10,021
'Cause your patients never die.

228
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:11,166
It's a compliment.

229
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,735
Oh, it has nothing
to do with the fact

230
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:14,236
that you're piling
up bad outcomes?

231
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,860
They were dud patients.

232
00:08:15,929 --> 00:08:18,997
I'm sure. Shall we?

233
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:21,615
Who do I have to pay to get
the tennis match on in here?

234
00:08:21,684 --> 00:08:23,568
We'll have a nurse look into it.

235
00:08:23,637 --> 00:08:25,717
Yeah, well, make
sure she's cute.

236
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:27,471
Chuck Cain, 71.

237
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,074
Came into the ER last night

238
00:08:29,142 --> 00:08:31,526
after a syncopal episode.

239
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:34,229
The scan showed a
narrowed aortic valve

240
00:08:34,298 --> 00:08:36,276
that we will replace during
open-heart procedure.

241
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:37,732
Open-heart?

242
00:08:37,801 --> 00:08:39,367
It's a safe surgery.
Don't worry.

243
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:41,480
I don't care about safe.
I care about the scar.

244
00:08:41,504 --> 00:08:42,670
How big?

245
00:08:42,739 --> 00:08:44,139
Ten inches at most.

246
00:08:44,207 --> 00:08:45,373
Ten? Nope.

247
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:46,941
Not doing it.

248
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:51,096
Trust me.

249
00:08:51,164 --> 00:08:52,730
A scar is a small price to pay

250
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:54,476
for how much better
you're going to feel.

251
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,661
How old do you think I am?

252
00:08:55,685 --> 00:08:56,918
You're 71.

253
00:08:58,288 --> 00:08:59,632
Because you read the chart.

254
00:08:59,656 --> 00:09:03,124
But if you didn't,
you'd say 60, right?

255
00:09:03,193 --> 00:09:04,988
Look, I'm in incredible shape,

256
00:09:05,012 --> 00:09:06,894
and the ladies agree.

257
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:10,515
But look, the minute you
open up my chest, I'm done.

258
00:09:10,584 --> 00:09:12,194
There's no more
meeting women at the pool

259
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:13,552
with a scar like that.

260
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:16,182
I mean, all they'll see is a
future of doctor's appointments,

261
00:09:16,206 --> 00:09:18,300
hospital visits, and bad sex.

262
00:09:18,324 --> 00:09:19,902
So, no. No open-heart surgery.

263
00:09:19,926 --> 00:09:20,975
Look, Mr. Cain.

264
00:09:21,044 --> 00:09:22,572
We'll investigate alternatives.

265
00:09:22,596 --> 00:09:24,523
And get me a decent
pillow while you're at it.

266
00:09:24,547 --> 00:09:26,731
My ass has got more
cushion than this thing.

267
00:09:35,892 --> 00:09:37,141
Is it July yet?

268
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:39,627
'Cause I need a whole
new crop of residents.

269
00:09:39,696 --> 00:09:41,674
Huh. Little Grey
still struggling?

270
00:09:41,698 --> 00:09:42,864
Oh, she's drowning.

271
00:09:42,932 --> 00:09:44,227
I didn't know how lucky I had it

272
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:45,651
until Meredith
was off my service.

273
00:09:47,487 --> 00:09:49,715
Do you know how to
read these budget reports?

274
00:09:49,739 --> 00:09:51,317
No. Why do you think
I gave up that job?

275
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:52,607
You're a huge help.

276
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:54,392
Homemade maple-ginger scones.

277
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,576
Try.

278
00:09:55,645 --> 00:09:57,372
Oh, no, no, no, really.
I just had a big lunch.

279
00:09:57,396 --> 00:09:59,414
The scone's a very
tough pastry to make.

280
00:09:59,482 --> 00:10:01,466
You have to be exact
with the ingredients,

281
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:02,574
the baking temperature...

282
00:10:02,636 --> 00:10:04,236
Hey, how is the house coming?

283
00:10:04,287 --> 00:10:05,203
We're working on the
drywall now. Really?

284
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:06,512
Mmm-hmm.

285
00:10:07,507 --> 00:10:09,691
All right. I get it. I'm a bore.

286
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,542
But Avery's doing
all my surgeries,

287
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,795
and I'm taking up cooking
to keep my mind sharp

288
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,379
for when the next
big case rolls in.

289
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,410
Yeah, you keep
telling yourself that.

290
00:10:17,434 --> 00:10:18,928
Dr. Shepherd. Yes.

291
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:20,730
Dr. Grey is looking for
you. She says it's important.

292
00:10:20,754 --> 00:10:22,554
My wife? Nope.

293
00:10:25,442 --> 00:10:26,590
Lexie.

294
00:10:27,894 --> 00:10:29,326
Try a scone.

295
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:30,795
You know you want to.

296
00:10:31,865 --> 00:10:33,514
Uh...

297
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:35,183
Attaboy. Mmm.

298
00:10:36,536 --> 00:10:38,297
Today we're taking
out the old hardware.

299
00:10:38,321 --> 00:10:40,388
Tomorrow Sloan will
remove the scar tissue.

300
00:10:40,457 --> 00:10:43,057
And then we'll implant the cage.

301
00:10:44,044 --> 00:10:46,026
Yeah! All right.

302
00:10:46,096 --> 00:10:47,762
So... Your turn.

303
00:10:50,367 --> 00:10:52,083
Just get in there and,

304
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:53,463
you know, have fun with it.

305
00:10:53,487 --> 00:10:55,407
Why wouldn't you just
do a fusion in this case?

306
00:10:55,455 --> 00:10:56,695
Isn't that standard procedure?

307
00:10:56,723 --> 00:10:58,100
He's had four fusions already,

308
00:10:58,124 --> 00:10:59,419
so we're really going
for a long-term solution.

309
00:10:59,443 --> 00:11:00,569
Really get in
there with the drill.

310
00:11:00,593 --> 00:11:02,713
Right, right, right. Come on.

311
00:11:03,196 --> 00:11:05,780
But the risk of paralysis is
quite high with your approach.

312
00:11:05,849 --> 00:11:08,749
Our approach, and only
lame surgeons do fusions.

313
00:11:08,818 --> 00:11:11,452
We're not lame.
We're fun. And badass.

314
00:11:11,521 --> 00:11:12,721
Here, like this.

315
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:14,439
There you go.

316
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:16,907
Oh, oh, oh.

317
00:11:16,976 --> 00:11:18,071
Yeah.

318
00:11:18,095 --> 00:11:19,905
There you go. Felt good, right?

319
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:21,441
Yep. Yeah.

320
00:11:23,116 --> 00:11:25,716
Dr. Yang, that's your phone.

321
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:28,369
Really? During surgery?

322
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:29,971
It could be anyone.

323
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,906
Mmm-hmm.

324
00:11:31,975 --> 00:11:34,186
Melanie, could you please
read Dr. Yang's message aloud?

325
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:35,804
Melanie, don't do
that. Yes, Melanie, do.

326
00:11:35,828 --> 00:11:36,972
It could be Chief Hunt.

327
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:38,708
He might need Dr. Yang
on an urgent matter.

328
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:42,495
Yep. Definitely sounds urgent.

329
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:44,118
Melanie, don't touch that phone!

330
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:45,536
Just, um...

331
00:11:46,673 --> 00:11:48,072
Turn it off.

332
00:11:55,231 --> 00:11:57,209
No more texting me in the OR.

333
00:11:57,233 --> 00:11:59,099
Well, did anyone...

334
00:12:00,069 --> 00:12:02,586
No. Good.

335
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:05,223
'Cause the only thing getting
me through these budget reports

336
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:07,325
is that, and I get to do this.

337
00:12:08,261 --> 00:12:09,360
Mmm.

338
00:12:11,765 --> 00:12:13,264
I have to check on my patient.

339
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:15,349
I don't want Callie to
give me a bad outcome.

340
00:12:15,435 --> 00:12:17,146
I'll be quick. Come on.

341
00:12:18,572 --> 00:12:21,072
Okay. Okay, okay.

342
00:12:22,558 --> 00:12:25,009
Hunt, I found
last year's budget.

343
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:27,495
I was just won...
Whoa. Whoa. Um...

344
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:29,264
Excuse me.

345
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:31,699
No, it's okay. I
was just leaving.

346
00:12:34,471 --> 00:12:36,520
Keep your phone on.

347
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:37,688
Okay.

348
00:12:39,776 --> 00:12:41,270
In the conference
room? Richard...

349
00:12:41,294 --> 00:12:43,644
Hunt, you're a chief now.

350
00:12:43,713 --> 00:12:45,113
Act like it.

351
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:51,168
In the conference room?

352
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:57,286
So tell me you found the article
I asked you for two days ago.

353
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:58,809
No, but I'm really close.

354
00:12:58,878 --> 00:13:01,089
This is the chart of a
patient with a butterfly tumor.

355
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:02,258
Butterfly tumors are inoperable.

356
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:04,293
No, I know, but this patient,

357
00:13:04,317 --> 00:13:06,862
she's a new mom, and it's
a really sad story, actually,

358
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:08,697
but I was wondering if you
could do a quick consult...

359
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:10,841
This is why you needed
to find me so urgently,

360
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:12,623
to tell a woman her
tumor's inoperable,

361
00:13:12,692 --> 00:13:14,725
to remind her how
sad her story is?

362
00:13:14,795 --> 00:13:15,905
No, I just...

363
00:13:15,929 --> 00:13:17,129
Just find the article.

364
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:21,010
Hey, April, I can't
cover the ER tonight.

365
00:13:21,034 --> 00:13:22,244
I have to do research
for Shepherd.

366
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:23,301
No, what?

367
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:24,513
Take it up with Shepherd.

368
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:25,936
I... Come on...

369
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:28,622
Where are my mouse labs?

370
00:13:28,691 --> 00:13:30,903
Oh, uh, sorry. I was
stuck in the OR all day,

371
00:13:30,927 --> 00:13:32,871
trying not to fall
behind in my surgeries.

372
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:34,991
Oh, so you'd rather just fall
behind in my opinion of you?

373
00:13:35,015 --> 00:13:37,009
I will take care
of it right away.

374
00:13:37,033 --> 00:13:40,101
It's hard to be a team when
only one player cares, Kepner.

375
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:42,086
We removed all the old hardware,

376
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:44,133
and we're all set to
implant the cage tomorrow.

377
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:45,484
So just try to get
some rest, okay?

378
00:13:45,508 --> 00:13:47,236
Oh, well, I'm
gonna stay the night

379
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,227
and make sure he's
got some company.

380
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:51,295
I'll stay. I don't
need the rest.

381
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:52,479
And I do?

382
00:13:52,548 --> 00:13:53,960
I don't know. You're
always talking about

383
00:13:53,984 --> 00:13:56,334
how big the bags
under your eyes are, so...

384
00:13:56,402 --> 00:13:58,086
What? Aren't
visiting hours over?

385
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:01,306
Yes. They are.

386
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:03,591
Sorry.

387
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,037
Uh... Um...

388
00:14:05,061 --> 00:14:06,472
All right. Well, call
if you need anything.

389
00:14:06,496 --> 00:14:07,807
All right? Okay.

390
00:14:07,831 --> 00:14:09,097
Okay.

391
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:14,635
Whew! Well, surgery brings
out the worst in people.

392
00:14:14,704 --> 00:14:16,866
Marriage brings out
the worst in them.

393
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:19,585
I'm grateful they dropped
everything to help take care of me,

394
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:22,576
but seriously, the second
I'm better, I'm moving out.

395
00:14:22,646 --> 00:14:24,512
I need some peace and quiet.

396
00:14:24,581 --> 00:14:27,581
Well, let me help you
get some now, okay?

397
00:14:35,925 --> 00:14:37,008
Mmm!

398
00:14:39,078 --> 00:14:40,244
What the hell?

399
00:14:40,312 --> 00:14:41,757
I want to check your
reflexes every half-hour

400
00:14:41,781 --> 00:14:43,981
to make sure there's no
nerve damage from the surgery.

401
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:51,488
You're home already?

402
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,418
Yeah, it's the advantage
of a boring caseload.

403
00:14:53,442 --> 00:14:55,154
Well, did your
day get any better?

404
00:14:55,178 --> 00:14:57,845
Yes, if you count the
fried chicken sandwich

405
00:14:57,913 --> 00:14:59,813
I got in the cafeteria.

406
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:05,064
Any interesting cases tomorrow?

407
00:15:05,088 --> 00:15:06,387
Meredith.

408
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:08,632
No work talk.
I'll be right back.

409
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:11,542
Meredith.

410
00:15:11,611 --> 00:15:13,088
Why didn't you tell
Derek about Mary's tumor?

411
00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:14,879
I did. He said it
was inoperable.

412
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:16,142
Did you show him the scans?

413
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:17,893
Did you tell him it
was in the frontal lobe?

414
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,016
I didn't get a chance.

415
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:22,186
Um, I am naked and
wet in the shower, so...

416
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:24,516
Derek's a tumor junkie.
He needs to see the scans

417
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:26,452
and meet the patient
to spark the case,

418
00:15:26,476 --> 00:15:28,905
the same way he needs
a 16th towel in the OR

419
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:30,623
to position his arm
on the microscope.

420
00:15:30,647 --> 00:15:33,225
Are you gonna remembe r all
this or do I need to write it down?

421
00:15:33,249 --> 00:15:35,433
Naked and wet in the shower.

422
00:15:35,502 --> 00:15:36,742
I need to write it down.

423
00:15:39,455 --> 00:15:40,955
Chuck Cain.

424
00:15:41,024 --> 00:15:43,624
I gave you his blood
work five hours ago.

425
00:15:43,693 --> 00:15:45,571
Alex, I need you to
cover the ER tonight.

426
00:15:45,595 --> 00:15:46,827
No.

427
00:15:46,896 --> 00:15:48,373
Look, before midnight
would be nice.

428
00:15:48,397 --> 00:15:49,775
I'm still looking. It's the ER.

429
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:51,109
People will die
if we're not there.

430
00:15:51,133 --> 00:15:52,711
Which will be
your fault, not mine.

431
00:15:52,735 --> 00:15:54,101
Got it. Here you go.

432
00:15:54,169 --> 00:15:55,603
Finally.

433
00:15:55,671 --> 00:15:58,831
Alex, please, can't you just
be a person for a second?

434
00:15:59,109 --> 00:16:00,407
See?

435
00:16:00,476 --> 00:16:02,543
This is why you
don't deserve this job.

436
00:16:02,612 --> 00:16:03,644
You're bad at it.

437
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:05,596
You get all stressed
out and frantic

438
00:16:05,665 --> 00:16:07,465
and nobody wants
to listen to you.

439
00:16:07,534 --> 00:16:09,995
You have no authority, and your
voice, it gets all high and nasally

440
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:11,663
like this when you're nervous.

441
00:16:11,687 --> 00:16:12,804
It's annoying.

442
00:16:12,872 --> 00:16:13,949
You're annoying, so, no,

443
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,284
I can't be a person
for a second.

444
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:16,374
Deal with your own crap!

445
00:16:31,424 --> 00:16:32,890
Still not paralyzed.

446
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:34,225
Good.

447
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:36,828
Do you know you snore?

448
00:16:36,896 --> 00:16:38,474
Yes, and I've been
told it's adorable.

449
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:39,958
It's not. MR. MOSER: Morning.

450
00:16:39,982 --> 00:16:41,560
Oh, sorry we're late, baby.

451
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:43,835
Of course, your
smarty-pants father

452
00:16:43,903 --> 00:16:46,465
refused to check the traffic
report. Are you hungry?

453
00:16:46,489 --> 00:16:48,322
Uh, he can't eat before surgery.

454
00:16:48,391 --> 00:16:50,591
See? I told you,
no food allowed.

455
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:52,704
Oh, please. One
little donut won't hurt.

456
00:16:52,728 --> 00:16:54,890
Actually, it will, just
like it will it hurt all of you

457
00:16:54,914 --> 00:16:58,065
by promoting high
cholesterol and plaque buildup.

458
00:17:04,274 --> 00:17:05,740
I confirmed your consults,

459
00:17:05,808 --> 00:17:07,720
and I know you're gonna
ask me about that article, but...

460
00:17:07,744 --> 00:17:09,476
You haven't found it yet? Look!

461
00:17:09,562 --> 00:17:10,722
Butterfly tumor.

462
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:19,269
Wait. I mean, all the
doctors we've seen

463
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:20,587
said the tumor's inoperable.

464
00:17:20,657 --> 00:17:22,606
Surgery could put her
in a coma or kill her.

465
00:17:22,675 --> 00:17:23,919
It's just another set of scans.

466
00:17:23,943 --> 00:17:25,421
Exactly, and it'll
be good for you

467
00:17:25,445 --> 00:17:26,856
to have some alone
time with Emma.

468
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,380
You know, that way I
can die knowing that

469
00:17:29,448 --> 00:17:31,488
you're not gonna
drop her on her head.

470
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:34,818
Fine.

471
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,136
Run the scans.

472
00:17:40,343 --> 00:17:41,392
Okay.

473
00:17:41,461 --> 00:17:43,511
I really don't
have time for this.

474
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:44,946
Two more moms just came in.

475
00:17:45,014 --> 00:17:47,943
Well, yeah, but as long as no
one's crowning, they'll be fine.

476
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:50,367
What are you doing?

477
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:52,303
Researching a new
surgery for my neck guy.

478
00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:53,715
What are you feeding my mouse?

479
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:56,290
Q is diabetic. A
donut could kill him.

480
00:17:56,359 --> 00:17:57,720
Then why is he in your office?

481
00:17:57,744 --> 00:17:59,984
So Meredith can
run tests on him.

482
00:18:00,029 --> 00:18:02,246
Are you really gonna
do her grunt work?

483
00:18:02,315 --> 00:18:04,782
Bailey blames me for
Richard losing his trial.

484
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:07,801
The last thing she wants
is for me to work on it.

485
00:18:07,871 --> 00:18:09,514
Which is why you're
doing it in secret.

486
00:18:09,538 --> 00:18:11,872
Okay, that is the worst
idea I've ever heard.

487
00:18:11,941 --> 00:18:13,073
Seriously.

488
00:18:13,142 --> 00:18:15,259
I am your chief
resident, Dr. Grey.

489
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,877
Which means if you cross me,

490
00:18:21,901 --> 00:18:24,618
I will make your
life a living hell.

491
00:18:25,755 --> 00:18:28,117
I will put you on
call every night,

492
00:18:28,141 --> 00:18:30,708
I will assign you dumb interns,

493
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:32,276
and I will make sure

494
00:18:32,345 --> 00:18:37,047
that you get every exploding
bowel and rotting limb

495
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,236
that comes into this hospital.

496
00:18:40,486 --> 00:18:41,585
Okay.

497
00:18:41,654 --> 00:18:43,087
Relax. I'll do it.

498
00:18:46,325 --> 00:18:47,641
Okay.

499
00:18:49,746 --> 00:18:52,112
It's 'cause I made my
voice different, right?

500
00:18:52,181 --> 00:18:53,564
That's why you...

501
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:55,873
Go away before you
embarrass yourself more.

502
00:18:59,739 --> 00:19:02,173
Oh, that's Owen. Duty calls.

503
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:05,409
Are you two talking
yet, or is it just sex?

504
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:07,077
Not just sex.

505
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,179
Hot, dirty,
stand-on-my-head sex.

506
00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:10,581
I'll take that as a no.

507
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:13,184
You know what?
Who cares if we talk?

508
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:15,092
Besides, if you want
to talk about something,

509
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,671
how about the fact that
you're wasting your fifth year

510
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,740
playing around with
vaginas and mice, huh?

511
00:19:19,809 --> 00:19:21,292
Want to talk about that?

512
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,172
Do you really
stand on your head?

513
00:19:23,196 --> 00:19:24,628
I'm very talented.

514
00:19:27,033 --> 00:19:29,867
This procedure is
minimally invasive.

515
00:19:29,935 --> 00:19:31,869
And the great news is,

516
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:34,705
the scar will look like
this. It's much smaller.

517
00:19:34,773 --> 00:19:38,159
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
but I want this instead.

518
00:19:38,227 --> 00:19:39,493
What the hell is that?

519
00:19:39,579 --> 00:19:40,839
That's my friend Tony's groin.

520
00:19:40,863 --> 00:19:42,374
I had him e-mail me
a picture last night.

521
00:19:42,398 --> 00:19:44,576
He had the same problem
with his valve last year,

522
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,279
and his doctor replaced it with
a catheter through the groin.

523
00:19:47,303 --> 00:19:48,414
See? Barely any scar.

524
00:19:48,438 --> 00:19:50,821
It's called a T-A-V-I.

525
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:53,190
Yeah, a TAVI is an
experimental procedure.

526
00:19:53,259 --> 00:19:54,775
There are tons of risks,

527
00:19:54,844 --> 00:19:56,310
bleeding, stroke...

528
00:19:56,396 --> 00:19:58,374
Look, I'm the one having
this and paying for it, right?

529
00:19:58,398 --> 00:20:00,275
So if I say I want a
TAVI, give me a TAVI.

530
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:03,217
Look, there is a much safer
solution to your problem.

531
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:05,503
It's called a rash guard.
You wear it at the pool.

532
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:06,770
No one will see your scar.

533
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:08,617
Clearly you've never
been to Palm Beach.

534
00:20:08,641 --> 00:20:10,941
Only fatties wear rash guards.

535
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:12,687
I can't get through to this guy.

536
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:13,944
He wants a TAVI.

537
00:20:14,012 --> 00:20:16,630
Look into it and decide
if he's a good candidate.

538
00:20:19,836 --> 00:20:21,235
I'll look into a TAVI.

539
00:20:21,304 --> 00:20:23,098
See? Now that's the
answer I was looking for.

540
00:20:23,122 --> 00:20:25,242
I knew you had it in you, kid.

541
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:33,013
Hey, Grey.

542
00:20:33,082 --> 00:20:34,114
No, keep walking.

543
00:20:34,183 --> 00:20:36,851
Eyes ahead. Act normal.

544
00:20:36,919 --> 00:20:38,953
I saw Kepner take a
mouse into that room.

545
00:20:39,021 --> 00:20:40,187
What's going on?

546
00:20:40,256 --> 00:20:41,621
I don't know anything.

547
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:43,390
You blinked. Okay.

548
00:20:43,459 --> 00:20:44,942
Okay, now, you know something.

549
00:20:45,011 --> 00:20:46,204
Is something wrong
with the device?

550
00:20:46,228 --> 00:20:47,405
I really shouldn't
talk about it.

551
00:20:47,429 --> 00:20:48,712
Grey.

552
00:20:48,781 --> 00:20:50,175
Bailey's not gonna
find out about it?

553
00:20:50,199 --> 00:20:51,810
Bailey locked me out
of my own mouse lab.

554
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:53,033
I'm not telling her crap.

555
00:20:54,904 --> 00:20:56,414
Some of the mice
are hyperglycemic.

556
00:20:56,438 --> 00:20:58,672
We're running some
tests to find out why.

557
00:20:58,741 --> 00:20:59,985
All right, this is what you do,

558
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:01,353
get a healthy mouse,
run some labs,

559
00:21:01,377 --> 00:21:02,904
and compare the
stats. Can you do that?

560
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:04,189
Well, April's
being a little bit...

561
00:21:04,213 --> 00:21:06,046
You can handle Kepner, Grey.

562
00:21:06,115 --> 00:21:07,909
Now, I'm on call, so page
me when you get the results.

563
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:08,949
Okay.

564
00:21:09,018 --> 00:21:10,367
All right.

565
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:15,339
Uh... Hi there.
Beautiful day, isn't it?

566
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:19,643
Oh, damn it.

567
00:21:19,712 --> 00:21:20,761
You need a hand?

568
00:21:20,829 --> 00:21:23,280
No, just, the cage won't fit.

569
00:21:23,349 --> 00:21:25,694
His bone's so destroyed,
the screws won't hold.

570
00:21:25,718 --> 00:21:27,029
We should do the fusion instead.

571
00:21:27,053 --> 00:21:28,797
No. Well, I researched it.

572
00:21:28,821 --> 00:21:31,350
We can re-fuse him if we take
down enough of his scar tissue...

573
00:21:31,374 --> 00:21:32,723
I said no.

574
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:34,692
Hey.

575
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:37,010
My surgery got pushed.

576
00:21:37,079 --> 00:21:38,356
And I can't pick
up the short ribs.

577
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,058
The butcher closes
at 6:00, right?

578
00:21:40,082 --> 00:21:41,426
Why are you so
gung ho to do this?

579
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:43,416
Why are you so not?

580
00:21:43,485 --> 00:21:45,496
We could roast a chicken. Yes.

581
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,898
Could we please
shut up about dinner?

582
00:21:46,922 --> 00:21:48,355
Please.

583
00:21:48,908 --> 00:21:50,407
Sorry.

584
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:52,154
Forget it. We're closing him up.

585
00:21:52,178 --> 00:21:53,226
What? No.

586
00:21:53,295 --> 00:21:55,062
Yes. We need more time

587
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:57,025
to figure out a new game
plan that's not a fusion.

588
00:21:57,049 --> 00:21:58,794
So I'm gonna secure the
cage temporarily and close.

589
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:00,817
Which means I'm free
to go to the butcher.

590
00:22:00,886 --> 00:22:02,369
Problem solved.

591
00:22:08,277 --> 00:22:11,378
Most astrocytomas spread
out through the corpus callosum.

592
00:22:11,447 --> 00:22:12,712
It fans out like smoke.

593
00:22:12,781 --> 00:22:14,576
But if you look at
your tumor, Mary,

594
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,461
I've never seen
anything like it.

595
00:22:16,485 --> 00:22:18,869
Look at the edges,
they're smooth, defined.

596
00:22:18,937 --> 00:22:20,282
They're easier to cut around.

597
00:22:20,306 --> 00:22:22,333
Yes, if I can keep
my entire dissection

598
00:22:22,357 --> 00:22:24,369
inside and never
let it drift outside...

599
00:22:24,393 --> 00:22:26,693
I'm sorry.

600
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:29,012
Are you, um, saying
what I think you're saying?

601
00:22:30,833 --> 00:22:32,911
Mary, I think I can
remove your tumor.

602
00:22:32,935 --> 00:22:34,200
I love this guy.

603
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:35,536
We don't know this guy.

604
00:22:35,605 --> 00:22:37,348
He's amazing, right?
Tell my husband.

605
00:22:37,372 --> 00:22:38,517
He's pretty amazing.

606
00:22:38,541 --> 00:22:40,674
This isn't a decision
you make on a whim.

607
00:22:40,743 --> 00:22:42,237
You're right. You need
time to make this decision.

608
00:22:42,261 --> 00:22:44,678
We don't need time.
We've decided. Sign me up.

609
00:22:44,747 --> 00:22:45,846
Emma.

610
00:22:46,982 --> 00:22:48,015
Yeah.

611
00:22:48,084 --> 00:22:50,467
If you get to call brain tumor,

612
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:51,885
I get to call Emma.

613
00:22:54,607 --> 00:22:57,141
It's not just the
two of us anymore.

614
00:22:57,910 --> 00:22:59,110
We have a daughter.

615
00:22:59,178 --> 00:23:01,011
She needs these
six months with you.

616
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,712
I mean, you're her mom.

617
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:05,783
Please, Mary.

618
00:23:06,568 --> 00:23:07,902
Don't do this.

619
00:23:21,934 --> 00:23:23,767
You're ditching
OB to be a vet now?

620
00:23:23,836 --> 00:23:25,513
April dumped
Bailey's trial on me.

621
00:23:25,537 --> 00:23:27,833
I would be annoyed, but it
turns out I'm good with mice.

622
00:23:27,857 --> 00:23:29,951
And I found her
secret snack drawer.

623
00:23:29,975 --> 00:23:31,258
Sweet.

624
00:23:31,327 --> 00:23:33,727
Hey. Hey, that is not
your food. Not your food.

625
00:23:35,764 --> 00:23:37,564
What have you done to my office?

626
00:23:37,632 --> 00:23:40,400
Get over it. I'm helping you.
And go get me a healthy mouse.

627
00:23:40,469 --> 00:23:43,737
Bailey hasn't left the lab in 48
hours. I can't steal another mouse.

628
00:23:43,806 --> 00:23:45,686
I can't steal another mouse.

629
00:23:47,109 --> 00:23:48,442
Fine.

630
00:23:48,511 --> 00:23:52,129
Fine. Just keep
going, and good job.

631
00:23:57,202 --> 00:23:59,080
Tell me what it feels
like to get a bad outcome.

632
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:00,198
Neck guy's paralyzed?

633
00:24:00,222 --> 00:24:02,656
Not yet.

634
00:24:02,724 --> 00:24:04,169
What would happen if I
took my name off the case?

635
00:24:04,193 --> 00:24:05,909
Do it. You can take my old guy.

636
00:24:05,978 --> 00:24:07,756
Altman's trying to make
me do a TAVI on him.

637
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:10,876
Oh, no way. You're just
asking for a bad outcome.

638
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,144
Peanut? No.

639
00:24:12,168 --> 00:24:13,500
Derek ran an MRA.

640
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:15,630
And found out he can reach
under the pericallosal vessels

641
00:24:15,654 --> 00:24:16,931
and reach the
tumor on both sides.

642
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:18,450
So he's operating? No.

643
00:24:18,474 --> 00:24:19,823
Mary's afraid of the risks.

644
00:24:19,892 --> 00:24:22,192
Well, Clay, really,
but she listened to him.

645
00:24:22,245 --> 00:24:24,405
Okay, but did you tell
them how good he is?

646
00:24:24,664 --> 00:24:25,796
Yeah.

647
00:24:26,682 --> 00:24:28,232
Kind of.

648
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,660
Do I have to do
everything myself?

649
00:24:33,289 --> 00:24:34,688
Hot.

650
00:24:34,756 --> 00:24:35,939
Right?

651
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:45,432
Come on. Come on, G.
Come on, little guy. Come on.

652
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:48,035
Your voice doesn't
whisper, Kepner.

653
00:24:48,104 --> 00:24:51,038
Sorry. Sorry. I didn't
want to distract you.

654
00:24:51,106 --> 00:24:54,241
I need to run an A1C on G.

655
00:24:54,309 --> 00:24:58,395
G is healthy. We don't
need to run an A1C on him.

656
00:24:58,464 --> 00:25:00,714
Yes, but I think I'm on
to something, though.

657
00:25:00,783 --> 00:25:02,182
On to what?

658
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:04,010
I'll tell you when
I figure it out.

659
00:25:09,558 --> 00:25:12,609
I read the research, I talked
to some other surgeons.

660
00:25:13,846 --> 00:25:15,445
But I'm not doing a TAVI on you.

661
00:25:17,583 --> 00:25:19,743
And that's your final answer?

662
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:22,552
That's my final answer.

663
00:25:22,621 --> 00:25:25,455
I'll give you some time
to make a decision.

664
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:29,960
And here I took you for a
guy who had a pair on him.

665
00:25:31,463 --> 00:25:34,164
It's a stupid scar, Chuck.

666
00:25:34,233 --> 00:25:36,553
You really want to
die because of it?

667
00:25:45,077 --> 00:25:47,177
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

668
00:25:47,245 --> 00:25:49,212
I got stuck planning
tomorrow's surgery.

669
00:25:49,281 --> 00:25:50,592
Well, did you figure it out?

670
00:25:50,616 --> 00:25:52,182
You know it. Sofia?

671
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:54,952
Mmm. She is asleep.
She was so talkative...

672
00:25:55,021 --> 00:25:56,153
Whoa!

673
00:25:58,758 --> 00:26:00,090
I miss that.

674
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:01,725
I bet I know what else you miss.

675
00:26:04,664 --> 00:26:06,697
Oh! Who's hungry? I
got braised short ribs,

676
00:26:06,765 --> 00:26:09,683
roasted potatoes, and
a nice pinot from Napa.

677
00:26:11,954 --> 00:26:13,487
It looks amazing.

678
00:26:21,013 --> 00:26:22,412
It's not me.

679
00:26:23,515 --> 00:26:25,265
Me neither.

680
00:26:26,935 --> 00:26:28,168
It's me.

681
00:26:33,942 --> 00:26:35,008
Oh!

682
00:26:59,051 --> 00:27:01,768
The car seat's not clicking in
and it's supposed to be clicking.

683
00:27:01,837 --> 00:27:03,219
Let me try.

684
00:27:10,446 --> 00:27:12,645
You just have to
line up the arrows.

685
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:14,731
I heard Dr. Shepherd came by.

686
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:19,069
Look...

687
00:27:19,138 --> 00:27:21,382
I'm sure he's a great surgeon,

688
00:27:21,406 --> 00:27:23,218
but we've seen a
lot of great surgeons.

689
00:27:23,242 --> 00:27:25,942
And I know I'm the
bad guy here, but...

690
00:27:27,213 --> 00:27:28,879
I just had a baby.

691
00:27:30,782 --> 00:27:32,983
I want to be happy, you know?

692
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:35,352
At least today.

693
00:27:36,489 --> 00:27:39,056
Maybe a couple more months.

694
00:27:39,125 --> 00:27:41,992
But a couple more
months isn't enough.

695
00:27:42,061 --> 00:27:43,510
She wants more.

696
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:45,579
We made this
decision a long time ago

697
00:27:45,614 --> 00:27:49,216
because we knew that
once Emma was born,

698
00:27:49,284 --> 00:27:50,617
we'd be too emotional.

699
00:27:50,685 --> 00:27:51,925
She's not thinking...

700
00:27:51,954 --> 00:27:55,072
But now she's seen
and held her baby.

701
00:27:55,124 --> 00:27:58,057
And she can't
imagine not being here.

702
00:27:58,127 --> 00:28:00,494
And she wants more time.

703
00:28:00,562 --> 00:28:02,195
I want more time.

704
00:28:04,266 --> 00:28:06,144
I'm not ready for her to die.

705
00:28:06,168 --> 00:28:07,884
And she's not, either.

706
00:28:07,953 --> 00:28:10,203
And that's why
she wants to fight.

707
00:28:15,894 --> 00:28:18,312
Diane Schiffman would
make a great wife, you know?

708
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:20,825
And she's great with
the kids at the block party.

709
00:28:20,849 --> 00:28:23,484
Yeah, 'cause she's always drunk.

710
00:28:23,552 --> 00:28:25,163
What about Wendy McDowell?

711
00:28:25,187 --> 00:28:28,347
Too uptight. She'll turn
Emma into a nervous wreck.

712
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:30,657
Erin Miller?

713
00:28:30,726 --> 00:28:32,943
She's way too hot for you.

714
00:28:33,012 --> 00:28:34,144
Mary.

715
00:28:35,147 --> 00:28:36,379
I know.

716
00:28:36,949 --> 00:28:38,265
It's time.

717
00:28:40,068 --> 00:28:41,401
Come here.

718
00:28:43,939 --> 00:28:47,457
Thank you, honey,
for giving me this.

719
00:28:50,129 --> 00:28:52,529
And I'm gonna see you soon.

720
00:28:57,036 --> 00:28:58,201
Oh!

721
00:29:00,605 --> 00:29:04,958
You, too, my precious,
little perfect girl.

722
00:29:08,814 --> 00:29:10,047
Okay.

723
00:29:13,068 --> 00:29:14,218
Okay.

724
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:22,125
Okay, let's go.

725
00:29:26,548 --> 00:29:27,914
Here we go.

726
00:29:46,001 --> 00:29:48,313
Are you kidding me? How
the hell is this not working?

727
00:29:48,337 --> 00:29:49,980
Dr. Torres... Just give
me a second, okay?

728
00:29:50,004 --> 00:29:52,706
As co-surgeon on this case, I
say we abandon the reconstruction,

729
00:29:52,774 --> 00:29:54,207
and do a standard fusion.

730
00:29:54,276 --> 00:29:56,020
We're not quitting. How many
times do I have to say that?

731
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:57,888
I'm simply recommending
an alternative solution.

732
00:29:57,912 --> 00:29:59,757
Yeah? Well, your solution sucks.

733
00:30:01,884 --> 00:30:03,311
He's lost motor
evoked responses.

734
00:30:03,335 --> 00:30:04,479
Okay, that's it.
You know, I'm out.

735
00:30:04,503 --> 00:30:05,613
I'm taking my name off the case.

736
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:07,721
Wait. There's an electrode out.

737
00:30:10,643 --> 00:30:12,209
Unbelievable.

738
00:30:12,277 --> 00:30:13,676
All right. How's that?

739
00:30:15,764 --> 00:30:17,631
Great. He's fine.

740
00:30:17,699 --> 00:30:19,611
Done. Your name's off the case.

741
00:30:19,635 --> 00:30:20,812
5.5-millimeter cobalt chrome rod

742
00:30:20,836 --> 00:30:22,197
and alternating
cross connectors.

743
00:30:22,221 --> 00:30:23,465
I'm gonna link the
three rods together.

744
00:30:23,489 --> 00:30:25,166
What? You can use
the cobalt rods for this?

745
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:27,550
What do you care?
You're off the case.

746
00:30:28,643 --> 00:30:30,494
Go!

747
00:30:30,562 --> 00:30:32,522
All right. Let's
get the next one.

748
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:36,927
I compared healthy
and hyperglycemic mice.

749
00:30:36,951 --> 00:30:38,680
It looks like the islet
cells are being rejected.

750
00:30:38,704 --> 00:30:40,937
So it's not the device.
Well, that's good.

751
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:45,308
It could be a recurrence
of autoimmunity.

752
00:30:45,377 --> 00:30:47,555
Or a problem with
the engraftment.

753
00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:49,413
Maybe it's not the
cells being rejected.

754
00:30:49,481 --> 00:30:51,342
Maybe they're just not surviving
because of other causes.

755
00:30:51,366 --> 00:30:52,777
So we should check
for signs of rejection?

756
00:30:52,801 --> 00:30:54,501
Exactly. Okay. Bump me.

757
00:30:57,422 --> 00:30:59,389
We're looking in
the wrong place.

758
00:30:59,457 --> 00:31:02,170
The device is working, but
something is harming the islet cells.

759
00:31:02,194 --> 00:31:03,772
How did you figure that
out? It doesn't matter.

760
00:31:03,796 --> 00:31:07,664
So tell Bailey to look
for signs of rejection.

761
00:31:07,733 --> 00:31:09,733
And who do you think you are?

762
00:31:09,802 --> 00:31:11,479
What? God? Is that who you are?

763
00:31:11,503 --> 00:31:13,231
Dr. Bailey, she was just
doing what I asked her to do.

764
00:31:13,255 --> 00:31:14,687
Because either you're God,

765
00:31:14,756 --> 00:31:18,008
or you are the most
reckless, arrogant resident

766
00:31:18,077 --> 00:31:20,410
I have come across
in my entire career.

767
00:31:20,478 --> 00:31:22,746
I mean, to put your hands
on another clinical trial

768
00:31:22,814 --> 00:31:26,016
after you already ruined
one is a level of stupidity

769
00:31:26,085 --> 00:31:27,679
so staggering... I delegated.

770
00:31:27,703 --> 00:31:29,314
This has nothing to do...

771
00:31:29,338 --> 00:31:31,171
You are fired from
my trial, Kepner.

772
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,772
And you...

773
00:31:32,841 --> 00:31:34,891
Just give me back my mouse.

774
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,477
Not until you read my research.

775
00:31:38,797 --> 00:31:41,431
Dr. Bailey! Read my research.

776
00:31:50,525 --> 00:31:52,806
Hey, that kinda works.

777
00:31:53,395 --> 00:31:54,872
Okay, I've cleared out the tumor

778
00:31:54,896 --> 00:31:56,908
on the right side of
the brain, but look.

779
00:31:56,932 --> 00:31:59,143
See all those vessels
blocking the way now?

780
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:00,545
It's like a line of defense.

781
00:32:00,569 --> 00:32:02,729
That's why the tumor's so smart.

782
00:32:02,771 --> 00:32:04,916
It grows on both
sides of the brain

783
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:07,051
so we'll be too
scared to cross over.

784
00:32:07,075 --> 00:32:09,843
But she has six months.
That's something.

785
00:32:09,911 --> 00:32:12,595
You know, and you tried. There's
no shame in stopping now...

786
00:32:12,664 --> 00:32:14,398
Lexie. Yeah.

787
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,916
We're not stopping.

788
00:32:17,886 --> 00:32:20,337
But you just said
the tumor is smart.

789
00:32:20,406 --> 00:32:22,739
We're smarter. Bipolars.

790
00:32:28,696 --> 00:32:30,430
Hey, it's my fifth year.

791
00:32:30,499 --> 00:32:33,149
I have to defend every decision
made in my OR at the boards.

792
00:32:33,218 --> 00:32:36,598
Do you know why I picked
you to be my co-surgeon?

793
00:32:36,622 --> 00:32:38,387
Because you...

794
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:40,534
You take crazy risks in the OR.

795
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:43,559
But the surgeon I've worked
with the past three days?

796
00:32:43,629 --> 00:32:48,164
Safe, boring, a B-minus
version of herself.

797
00:32:48,233 --> 00:32:49,810
I get it. Fifth year
is competitive.

798
00:32:49,834 --> 00:32:51,379
Your whole career depends on it,

799
00:32:51,403 --> 00:32:52,735
but if you're not careful,

800
00:32:52,788 --> 00:32:54,265
you're gonna wake up one day

801
00:32:54,289 --> 00:32:56,856
and realize that you're
no longer the badass,

802
00:32:56,925 --> 00:33:00,193
hard-core, spontaneous,
take-charge,

803
00:33:00,262 --> 00:33:03,263
crazy, fun person
you thought you were,

804
00:33:03,331 --> 00:33:07,967
but instead, some sad, sorry
wife who stays in every night

805
00:33:08,036 --> 00:33:10,932
and talks about food like it's
an orgasm when it's clearly not.

806
00:33:10,956 --> 00:33:12,889
An orgasm is an orgasm.

807
00:33:14,209 --> 00:33:15,825
I'm sorry. What?

808
00:33:20,749 --> 00:33:23,189
Don't let fifth year get to you.

809
00:33:32,544 --> 00:33:33,610
Hi.

810
00:33:34,396 --> 00:33:35,879
You mind if I sit?

811
00:33:35,947 --> 00:33:37,147
Please.

812
00:33:59,053 --> 00:34:00,548
She's herniating. What
the hell happened?

813
00:34:00,572 --> 00:34:02,788
A vessel leaked. The
tumor's starting to swell.

814
00:34:02,857 --> 00:34:04,335
Okay, we're gonna
have to drain the ventricle.

815
00:34:04,359 --> 00:34:06,143
Get me a blunt-tip needle. Now.

816
00:34:06,211 --> 00:34:07,444
You're going in blind?

817
00:34:07,496 --> 00:34:09,128
We have no choice.

818
00:34:52,791 --> 00:34:54,074
Just tell me.

819
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:56,576
We got it.

820
00:34:56,644 --> 00:34:58,044
We got the whole tumor.

821
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:06,102
Thank you.

822
00:35:06,971 --> 00:35:08,321
Thank you.

823
00:35:10,958 --> 00:35:13,092
You have a mommy, Emma.

824
00:35:13,995 --> 00:35:15,628
You have a mommy.

825
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,405
Once they have prepped you,

826
00:35:30,429 --> 00:35:33,474
I will meet you in the
cath lab and do the TAVI.

827
00:35:33,498 --> 00:35:34,881
Hey, Chuck, what the hell?

828
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:36,065
Crap.

829
00:35:37,619 --> 00:35:40,036
Look, the lady had a
bigger pair than you.

830
00:35:40,105 --> 00:35:42,105
No hard feelings,
okay? Let's go.

831
00:35:44,226 --> 00:35:45,975
Hey, doll, how old
do you think I am?

832
00:35:46,678 --> 00:35:48,077
I want my patient back.

833
00:35:48,147 --> 00:35:50,090
I was being cautious. You
can't punish me for that.

834
00:35:50,114 --> 00:35:51,914
Actually, I can.

835
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:54,968
You've had some bad outcomes.
We all get bad outcomes.

836
00:35:55,037 --> 00:35:57,420
Your problem is that
you let it get to you,

837
00:35:57,489 --> 00:35:59,939
and now you're scared.

838
00:36:00,008 --> 00:36:02,408
The only thing worse than a
bad surgeon is a scared one.

839
00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:09,760
Pretty soon,
you'll be able to do

840
00:36:09,784 --> 00:36:11,129
everything you
couldn't do before,

841
00:36:11,153 --> 00:36:14,154
feed yourself,
look girls in the eye.

842
00:36:14,222 --> 00:36:16,122
How about sports?

843
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:17,891
Don't be an idiot, idiot.

844
00:36:17,959 --> 00:36:19,470
You know that he
cannot do sports.

845
00:36:19,494 --> 00:36:21,427
Will you just get a divorce?

846
00:36:21,496 --> 00:36:23,936
And what did I tell you
about this name calling?

847
00:36:24,333 --> 00:36:25,732
Get a divorce.

848
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,979
Well, okay, then I got a
new one for you, bitch face.

849
00:36:28,003 --> 00:36:29,119
Oh, how original.

850
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:30,420
I said get a divorce!

851
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:37,110
I get it.

852
00:36:37,179 --> 00:36:40,046
You had to stay together
until I was outta high school.

853
00:36:40,115 --> 00:36:41,765
Then it was college,

854
00:36:41,833 --> 00:36:43,811
and then this neck thing
happened, but that's over now.

855
00:36:43,835 --> 00:36:46,503
My neck's fine, so you two
are free to leave each other.

856
00:36:46,571 --> 00:36:48,966
Listen, kiddo. No, baby, it
has nothing to do with you.

857
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:51,241
You hate each other!

858
00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:54,143
You hate each other.
It's obvious. So go.

859
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:57,646
Go to the court.
Just get a divorce!

860
00:37:03,821 --> 00:37:05,981
Okay, why don't we
give Tyler some space?

861
00:37:16,117 --> 00:37:17,767
How'd that feel?

862
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:20,103
Awesome.

863
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:24,707
Yeah.

864
00:37:35,386 --> 00:37:37,821
Uh, you paged?

865
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:42,992
Eight of the mice
are hyperglycemic.

866
00:37:43,061 --> 00:37:44,226
What?

867
00:37:44,296 --> 00:37:48,097
I've been locked in
this lab all day and night,

868
00:37:48,166 --> 00:37:52,018
hiding it from you,
trying to understand why,

869
00:37:52,087 --> 00:37:54,270
and Meredith
Grey figured it out.

870
00:37:54,339 --> 00:37:57,456
Now I've got just
weeks' worth of

871
00:37:57,526 --> 00:38:00,126
tests to run and
mice to monitor,

872
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:02,062
real patients to check on.

873
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:03,179
Well, so you get help.

874
00:38:03,247 --> 00:38:05,715
From who? I fired Kepner.

875
00:38:05,784 --> 00:38:08,179
There's no way in hell I'm
putting Meredith on this trial.

876
00:38:08,203 --> 00:38:11,237
Help will show up.
Trust me. It always does.

877
00:38:13,759 --> 00:38:15,775
So, you're gonna go home,

878
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:18,644
get some rest.

879
00:38:18,714 --> 00:38:21,431
The work will be here in
the morning. Go. Right now.

880
00:38:32,577 --> 00:38:35,211
Don't worry, Q. I got your back.

881
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:41,734
He just went in blind
and he hit the ventricle.

882
00:38:41,803 --> 00:38:45,120
It was the most incredible
thing I have ever seen.

883
00:38:45,189 --> 00:38:47,401
All Sloan taught me today
was how to brine a chicken.

884
00:38:47,425 --> 00:38:50,593
Altman called me a chicken.

885
00:38:50,662 --> 00:38:54,230
What you said to me the other
day was horrible, mean, and...

886
00:38:54,282 --> 00:38:55,376
All right. You're
doing it again.

887
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,040
You're like a friggin' mosquito.

888
00:38:58,536 --> 00:39:00,648
Yeah, well, that's all changing.

889
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:02,483
Lexie, you're leading
pre-rounds tomorrow.

890
00:39:02,507 --> 00:39:04,084
Jackson, you're
touring med students,

891
00:39:04,108 --> 00:39:06,554
and, Alex, you've got nights
in the ER for the next week.

892
00:39:06,578 --> 00:39:07,818
Any of you argue with me,

893
00:39:07,862 --> 00:39:10,143
and I'll take you off the
OR board indefinitely.

894
00:39:12,133 --> 00:39:14,779
I, on the other hand, just
got fired from Bailey's trial.

895
00:39:14,803 --> 00:39:18,605
So I'm gonna spend the night
drinking and flirting with boys.

896
00:39:23,461 --> 00:39:24,577
Ah!

897
00:39:35,490 --> 00:39:37,170
Whoa, whoa.

898
00:39:39,444 --> 00:39:42,228
No. We can't do this anymore.

899
00:39:42,297 --> 00:39:44,447
No more sex in the hospital.

900
00:39:45,917 --> 00:39:49,251
You know, I'm Chief
now. I have to act like it.

901
00:39:51,506 --> 00:39:53,088
Fine. Whatever.

902
00:39:58,947 --> 00:40:00,596
Do you want to go get dinner?

903
00:40:02,384 --> 00:40:04,150
Uh, sure.

904
00:40:04,219 --> 00:40:06,936
<i>It's not always easy
to speak your mind.</i>

905
00:40:08,522 --> 00:40:11,224
Or we could just go
home and have sex there.

906
00:40:12,627 --> 00:40:14,294
Let's do that. Yeah.

907
00:40:14,362 --> 00:40:17,096
Okay? Let's do that. Okay.

908
00:40:17,165 --> 00:40:19,932
<i>Sometimes you need
to be forced to do it.</i>

909
00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:29,992
Hey. You brought pizza?

910
00:40:30,061 --> 00:40:32,361
No. Pizza? I made a coq au vin.

911
00:40:37,368 --> 00:40:39,113
What are you... Wait.
No, no, no. What...

912
00:40:39,137 --> 00:40:40,898
What are you doing?
Not my coq au vin!

913
00:40:40,922 --> 00:40:43,122
Mark, I love you.

914
00:40:43,191 --> 00:40:45,391
I love how great you
are with our daughter.

915
00:40:45,459 --> 00:40:49,528
I love that you and Arizona
are friends. But you...

916
00:40:49,597 --> 00:40:52,093
You need to leave, 'cause
tonight I'm gonna eat pizza

917
00:40:52,117 --> 00:40:53,594
and drink beer in
bed with my wife

918
00:40:53,618 --> 00:40:55,028
and tell her all about
the neck I just built,

919
00:40:55,052 --> 00:40:56,880
and then we're gonna
have lots and lots of sex.

920
00:40:56,904 --> 00:40:58,837
Okay? We're great parents,

921
00:40:58,906 --> 00:41:00,384
but we're more than just
mommies and daddies.

922
00:41:00,408 --> 00:41:03,893
We are hot and we are sexy,

923
00:41:03,962 --> 00:41:06,707
and your new hobby, the
hollandaise and the short ribs

924
00:41:06,731 --> 00:41:09,009
and the coq au vin, is getting
in the way of our sex lives.

925
00:41:09,033 --> 00:41:12,851
So, please, start
having sex again.

926
00:41:12,921 --> 00:41:16,241
Okay? But not tonight. 'Cause
tonight, you're babysitting.

927
00:41:19,093 --> 00:41:20,760
Can I at least have some pizza?

928
00:41:34,225 --> 00:41:36,192
That was incredibly hot.

929
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:50,223
<i>Sometimes it's better to just
keep things to yourself, though.</i>

930
00:41:50,291 --> 00:41:51,324
<i>Play dumb...</i>

931
00:41:51,392 --> 00:41:52,959
I had a good day.

932
00:41:53,028 --> 00:41:57,813
So good, in fact, I wanna break
our rule and tell you about it.

933
00:41:57,882 --> 00:42:01,116
<i>Even when your whole
body's aching to come clean.</i>

934
00:42:01,719 --> 00:42:02,735
Don't.

935
00:42:02,804 --> 00:42:04,269
Are you sure?

936
00:42:11,896 --> 00:42:12,976
Come here.

937
00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:14,647
<i>So you shut your mouth...</i>

938
00:42:14,715 --> 00:42:16,182
<i>Keep the secret...</i>

939
00:42:16,251 --> 00:42:19,018
<i>And find other ways
to make yourself happy.</i>
