1
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:09,374
<i>Say you're in the OR,</i>

2
00:00:09,443 --> 00:00:11,392
<i>repairing a vena cava,</i>

3
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:15,864
<i>when suddenly,
everything goes to hell...</i>

4
00:00:15,933 --> 00:00:18,762
I think we should practice
our statements to the judge.

5
00:00:18,786 --> 00:00:20,981
I think you should stop
worrying about it and relax.

6
00:00:21,005 --> 00:00:22,415
I could help you with that.

7
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:24,339
Derek, we have 36 hours

8
00:00:24,407 --> 00:00:27,019
before we have to convince a
judge that we're Zola's parents.

9
00:00:27,043 --> 00:00:28,576
We are Zola's parents.

10
00:00:28,645 --> 00:00:30,528
But they don't know that.

11
00:00:30,597 --> 00:00:33,131
And for all they know,
we hate children.

12
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,518
We feed cute little kittens to a
dog we keep in the backyard.

13
00:00:36,586 --> 00:00:37,753
Meredith.

14
00:00:37,821 --> 00:00:40,272
I'm just saying,
they don't know us.

15
00:00:40,341 --> 00:00:42,541
All we have to do
is just stand up there

16
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:46,077
and speak from the heart.

17
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:48,747
That's all the
convincing they'll need.

18
00:00:49,766 --> 00:00:50,966
Okay?

19
00:00:51,035 --> 00:00:52,634
Okay.

20
00:00:52,703 --> 00:00:55,971
<i>So you cut this, suture that,</i>

21
00:00:56,040 --> 00:01:00,341
<i>and soon that crappy
situation is a thing of the past.</i>

22
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:03,512
I missed you this morning.
Is everything okay?

23
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:05,892
Yeah. I just wanted to
get a run in before work.

24
00:01:05,916 --> 00:01:07,516
Oh.

25
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:11,386
Okay. I gotta get upstairs if I'm
gonna beat Shepherd to rounds,

26
00:01:11,454 --> 00:01:13,254
so I'll see you later?

27
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:16,386
<i>Too bad you can't meet all of life's
challenges with a surgical scalpel.</i>

28
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,622
Yeah. All right.
I'll see you later.

29
00:01:18,646 --> 00:01:20,562
<i>I mean, you could try.</i>

30
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:22,447
Going up? Nope.

31
00:01:22,515 --> 00:01:23,798
Yeah, you are.

32
00:01:23,867 --> 00:01:25,317
Avery. Today's the day.

33
00:01:25,386 --> 00:01:27,236
You, me, cross-facial
nerve graft.

34
00:01:27,304 --> 00:01:28,320
You pumped? I'm pumped.

35
00:01:28,388 --> 00:01:29,499
All right. Get pumped.

36
00:01:29,523 --> 00:01:31,056
Getting pumped.

37
00:01:31,125 --> 00:01:34,475
<i>But I'm pretty sure that'd
be considered assault.</i>

38
00:01:34,544 --> 00:01:37,963
Dr. Bailey, I've been
going over this islet cell data

39
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:41,400
and I think that... Dr. Bailey?

40
00:01:41,469 --> 00:01:43,246
Are we not going to the
mouse lab today? Because I...

41
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:45,315
We've got bigger things to
worry about than mice, Grey.

42
00:01:45,339 --> 00:01:48,107
Like, um, guinea pigs?

43
00:01:48,175 --> 00:01:50,153
Are your feet as
quick as your wit?

44
00:01:50,177 --> 00:01:52,293
Move 'em.

45
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:54,963
Ooh! Sorry, Karev. I'm gonna
need your esophageal atresia.

46
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:56,142
What...

47
00:01:56,166 --> 00:01:57,344
Oh, and you have
a pyloric stenosis.

48
00:01:57,368 --> 00:01:58,600
I might need that one, too.

49
00:01:58,668 --> 00:02:00,135
What are you... Why?

50
00:02:00,204 --> 00:02:02,382
'Cause we have a prospective
Peds fellow coming in today,

51
00:02:02,406 --> 00:02:03,783
and she's being courted
by all the big guns,

52
00:02:03,807 --> 00:02:06,308
USC, Johns Hopkins, CHOP,

53
00:02:06,377 --> 00:02:09,222
and Hunt asked me to help to
make sure she got the red-carpet tour,

54
00:02:09,246 --> 00:02:11,324
and that includes scrubbing
in on a couple of surgeries.

55
00:02:11,348 --> 00:02:12,480
Wait.

56
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:14,060
You're already meeting
people for the fellowship?

57
00:02:14,084 --> 00:02:15,283
It's a little early,

58
00:02:15,351 --> 00:02:17,063
but when someone with
Polly Preston's resume

59
00:02:17,087 --> 00:02:19,567
wants to observe in your
hospital, you make time.

60
00:02:22,977 --> 00:02:25,711
Justine, these three
bubble-like spots.

61
00:02:25,779 --> 00:02:28,013
Those are your aneurysms.

62
00:02:29,049 --> 00:02:30,516
Just a second.

63
00:02:33,954 --> 00:02:37,472
Sorry. I didn't hear
a word. Say again.

64
00:02:37,541 --> 00:02:39,808
Ah! My aneurysms.
Horrible things.

65
00:02:39,877 --> 00:02:41,254
What are they
doing now, growing?

66
00:02:41,278 --> 00:02:42,939
Is that why the
god-awful headaches?

67
00:02:42,963 --> 00:02:44,045
One has sprung a leak.

68
00:02:46,049 --> 00:02:47,265
Great.

69
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:48,561
Go ahead. Say it.

70
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:49,918
Say I told you so.

71
00:02:49,987 --> 00:02:51,648
He's been warning
me about this for years,

72
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:54,206
and I have been
avoiding this surgery.

73
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:57,609
Fine.

74
00:02:57,678 --> 00:02:59,277
Okay.

75
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:02,280
But it's gonna have to wait
until I'm done with my book.

76
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:03,993
Dr. Grey, what are the
possible consequences

77
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,750
of not fixing a warning leak?

78
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:08,035
Stroke, hemorrhage, death.

79
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:12,574
Dr. Grey, what are the possible
consequences for a botched clip?

80
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,794
Stroke, hemorrhage, death.

81
00:03:15,863 --> 00:03:17,796
So I'm dead, and my
book's not finished.

82
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:19,676
I can't do that to my readers.

83
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,801
I just need to find a way
to get Kate to the bridge

84
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,413
where she's supposed
to meet Nathan

85
00:03:24,437 --> 00:03:25,932
before she's
pulled back in time.

86
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:27,439
After that, I'm all yours.

87
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:28,940
Justine...

88
00:03:29,009 --> 00:03:31,693
Yeah, between your voice
and my leaky aneurysm,

89
00:03:31,761 --> 00:03:34,629
I'm having a bitch of
a time focusing, so...

90
00:03:34,698 --> 00:03:36,615
Could you...

91
00:03:36,683 --> 00:03:38,483
Please?

92
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:47,754
When I say this is a
very important patient,

93
00:03:47,778 --> 00:03:49,889
I mean, she is very
important to me.

94
00:03:49,913 --> 00:03:52,558
I do not like it, but I have
a very full schedule today,

95
00:03:52,582 --> 00:03:54,694
and you will have
to be my proxy.

96
00:03:54,718 --> 00:03:56,730
No one touches
this patient but you.

97
00:03:56,754 --> 00:03:58,665
You will run
every test I ask for.

98
00:03:58,689 --> 00:04:01,434
You will report every
result back to me personally.

99
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:04,604
This woman has lost a husband
and a son in this hospital.

100
00:04:04,628 --> 00:04:08,897
I will not have another
O'Malley lost under this roof.

101
00:04:08,966 --> 00:04:12,067
O'Malley? George's
mother is our VIP?

102
00:04:12,135 --> 00:04:13,468
Meredith Grey.

103
00:04:13,537 --> 00:04:15,053
As promised.

104
00:04:15,122 --> 00:04:19,241
It's been so long. Oh, you come
over here and give me a hug.

105
00:04:24,898 --> 00:04:27,198
This is so freaking cool.

106
00:04:27,268 --> 00:04:29,628
I bet it never occurred to
you to put this on your wish list.

107
00:04:29,652 --> 00:04:32,054
How's that coming, by the way?

108
00:04:32,122 --> 00:04:33,599
Why? Do you need it today?

109
00:04:33,623 --> 00:04:36,408
Because I can't... I'm not done.

110
00:04:36,477 --> 00:04:40,245
You do get that this is
supposed to be fun, right?

111
00:04:40,314 --> 00:04:42,748
Right. I need more time.

112
00:04:42,816 --> 00:04:47,853
Um, do you mind just moving
more to your left, please?

113
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,335
Your husband's in the gallery.

114
00:04:52,359 --> 00:04:53,391
I know.

115
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,226
Henry's been begging
for a ride-along.

116
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:56,655
I figured, if you're
gonna observe a surgery,

117
00:04:56,679 --> 00:04:59,314
this is the one you want to see.

118
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:03,201
How are we doing, Dr. Park?

119
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:06,204
Just a few more minutes,
and my guy down at UCLA

120
00:05:06,273 --> 00:05:10,225
will have the heart he's been
waiting on for over a year.

121
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,811
Okay. Let's roll.

122
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:16,731
Got it.

123
00:05:21,455 --> 00:05:23,888
Make sure that
connection is secure.

124
00:05:23,957 --> 00:05:26,391
This tube connects
directly to the aorta.

125
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:29,572
That's right, and this
tube removes waste.

126
00:05:29,596 --> 00:05:30,612
Got it.

127
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,024
Dr. Park, your
hospital's on the line.

128
00:05:32,048 --> 00:05:34,048
Look at that.

129
00:05:34,117 --> 00:05:35,828
She's about to
catch a flight to L.A.

130
00:05:35,852 --> 00:05:37,614
and not even know
she left the body.

131
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:40,021
Damn it.

132
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:41,840
What is it?

133
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:43,786
My guy arrested. They
weren't able to resuscitate.

134
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:45,193
He's dead?

135
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:46,611
Damn it.

136
00:05:48,882 --> 00:05:51,049
All dressed up,
and no place to go.

137
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:11,436
Here. Let me get it.

138
00:06:11,505 --> 00:06:13,905
It says here you've had
surgery three weeks ago

139
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:15,251
at Seattle Pres for a
gallbladder removal?

140
00:06:15,275 --> 00:06:17,103
I've gone back there
a couple of times,

141
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:19,222
and they always tell me I'm
fine and send me back home.

142
00:06:19,246 --> 00:06:21,879
Bring me a 20-gauge
just in case, and benzoin.

143
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:23,393
And, you know,
it's freezing in here.

144
00:06:23,417 --> 00:06:24,894
Have someone take a
look at that thermostat.

145
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:26,562
Yes, Doctor. I'm going
to palpate your abdomen,

146
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:28,770
and you let me know if you
feel any discomfort, okay?

147
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:31,406
The boys insisted I do my
surgery somewhere else,

148
00:06:31,475 --> 00:06:36,494
after what happened here
with Harold and Georgie.

149
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:38,190
She's got some
midepigastric tenderness.

150
00:06:38,214 --> 00:06:39,525
We should check
that gallbladder.

151
00:06:39,549 --> 00:06:42,383
Have you been experiencing
any fevers at all, Louise?

152
00:06:42,452 --> 00:06:43,985
Any pain, vomiting?

153
00:06:44,053 --> 00:06:45,503
Yes, actually, I have.

154
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:47,292
Mrs. O'Malley, those
aren't good things.

155
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,756
I know. I'm sorry.

156
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:51,559
It's just that... Look at you.

157
00:06:51,627 --> 00:06:54,987
You know how proud it makes
me to have you as my doctor?

158
00:06:55,132 --> 00:06:56,230
Thank you.

159
00:06:56,299 --> 00:06:59,700
Grey, let's get a
CT, CBC, lytes,

160
00:06:59,787 --> 00:07:02,904
and a liver panel, and let's
get another couple of blankets.

161
00:07:02,973 --> 00:07:06,001
I kept hearing Georgie's voice
saying, "Mom, get a second opinion.

162
00:07:06,025 --> 00:07:08,221
"Go to Seattle Grace.
They'll take care of you."

163
00:07:08,245 --> 00:07:11,329
We will, Louise. We're gonna
take very good care of you.

164
00:07:11,397 --> 00:07:12,764
A doctor.

165
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:15,000
You're all grown up.

166
00:07:18,388 --> 00:07:21,284
Looks like Columbia's got a good
match who's already consented.

167
00:07:21,308 --> 00:07:23,608
We're contacting them
now to arrange pickup,

168
00:07:23,677 --> 00:07:25,437
but it will be hours
before they arrive.

169
00:07:25,461 --> 00:07:27,290
In the meantime, her
vitals need to be monitored

170
00:07:27,314 --> 00:07:29,158
and lactate levels
checked hourly.

171
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:31,816
Okay, so I'll find
an intern to babysit.

172
00:07:31,885 --> 00:07:34,385
Oh, I'm not leaving
her with an intern.

173
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:37,316
You're not serious. Dr. Yang,

174
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:39,540
this is a beating
heart in a box.

175
00:07:39,609 --> 00:07:41,042
I'm very serious.

176
00:07:41,111 --> 00:07:43,973
And you need more time to
finish your wish list anyway.

177
00:07:43,997 --> 00:07:45,096
Right?

178
00:07:45,164 --> 00:07:47,332
Page if you need me.

179
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:53,121
<i>Shepherd, I can't approve this.</i>

180
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:54,633
I'm not asking your approval.

181
00:07:54,657 --> 00:07:57,320
I'm giving you a
heads-up, as a courtesy.

182
00:07:57,344 --> 00:07:58,788
I have to be at a board meeting.

183
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:00,161
Don't let me hold you up.

184
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:08,397
Yikes. These are intense.
Are these patients of yours?

185
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:10,399
They will be. I went
looking for patients

186
00:08:10,423 --> 00:08:12,518
who were told no by
every doctor they've seen.

187
00:08:12,542 --> 00:08:13,675
So what are you gonna do?

188
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:14,954
Tell them yes.

189
00:08:14,978 --> 00:08:16,372
Tell them I will do my best.

190
00:08:16,396 --> 00:08:18,596
It's not just me. It's you, too.

191
00:08:18,815 --> 00:08:20,193
You ready? Me?

192
00:08:20,217 --> 00:08:21,417
Mmm-hmm. I...

193
00:08:22,035 --> 00:08:23,517
Yes, of course.

194
00:08:24,588 --> 00:08:26,287
What's this?

195
00:08:26,356 --> 00:08:28,023
Uh, Justine Campbell's AMA form.

196
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:29,535
She's leaving against
medical advice so...

197
00:08:29,559 --> 00:08:30,703
So you're not ready.

198
00:08:30,727 --> 00:08:31,826
What? Why?

199
00:08:31,895 --> 00:08:33,694
Yes. We're saying yes.

200
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:35,208
If you can't get her to say yes

201
00:08:35,232 --> 00:08:37,832
to a simple surgery
that will save her life,

202
00:08:37,901 --> 00:08:40,201
how do you expect
to tackle that?

203
00:08:42,405 --> 00:08:44,105
Tear those up.

204
00:08:44,174 --> 00:08:45,851
Get her to say yes, and I'll
let you jump on one of these.

205
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:49,110
Okay? What do you say?

206
00:08:49,179 --> 00:08:51,019
Yes. Damn right.

207
00:08:55,318 --> 00:08:57,235
Come on. Tell me I'm
paranoid or something.

208
00:08:57,303 --> 00:08:59,220
You're paranoid. Thank you.

209
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:00,816
Although, she did throw
a softball at his girlfriend.

210
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,973
I know. Screw this.

211
00:09:03,026 --> 00:09:04,854
You know, I can't be
around Sloan today. I...

212
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:07,078
Just take me off
Plastics, just for the day.

213
00:09:07,147 --> 00:09:08,429
I gotta clear my head.

214
00:09:08,498 --> 00:09:09,875
I am not gonna rearrange
the whole surgical schedule

215
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:11,210
just 'cause you're
having girl problems.

216
00:09:11,234 --> 00:09:12,533
Just suck it up.

217
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:16,237
You guys ever hear
of a Polly Preston?

218
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:17,905
Chief resident at the Brigham?

219
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:20,308
She's only my number
one peer role model.

220
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:21,687
You're a freak, and I hate you.

221
00:09:21,711 --> 00:09:23,711
What are you working
on today, Karev?

222
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,880
A fat lot of nothing now. Why?

223
00:09:25,949 --> 00:09:27,710
How would you feel
about a nerve graft?

224
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:30,618
I would feel great
about a nerve graft.

225
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:34,188
Fine.

226
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:36,323
Thank you.

227
00:09:40,697 --> 00:09:41,880
Ooh.

228
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:43,231
The pain's getting worse?

229
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,761
Does it look like
it's getting better?

230
00:09:44,785 --> 00:09:46,813
I know what can
really help. What?

231
00:09:46,837 --> 00:09:48,314
Clipping your aneurysm. Cute.

232
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:50,321
Look, I'm sure if you
call your publishers

233
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:52,340
and you tell them, they'll
extend the deadline.

234
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:54,626
It is not about a deadline.

235
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:57,028
It's about my readers out there,

236
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:59,764
who are waiting for
me to finish a series

237
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:01,694
that they have been
following for ten years.

238
00:10:01,718 --> 00:10:02,838
You're really that popular?

239
00:10:04,087 --> 00:10:06,366
You really know how to kick
a girl in the ego, don't you?

240
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:08,289
I'm sorry.

241
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:10,278
We don't get a lot of
time to read around here.

242
00:10:11,261 --> 00:10:12,426
Uh, what about your family?

243
00:10:12,495 --> 00:10:14,173
I mean, I'm sure that
they wouldn't want...

244
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:16,564
Do you see any family
sitting with me, Dr. Grey?

245
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:17,898
I'm a writer.

246
00:10:17,985 --> 00:10:19,650
My characters are my family,

247
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:22,086
and I care about them.

248
00:10:22,155 --> 00:10:23,966
And I've managed to
make a lot of other people

249
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:25,406
care about them as well.

250
00:10:25,492 --> 00:10:28,626
Yes, I want to give
my readers closure.

251
00:10:28,695 --> 00:10:32,263
But Kate and Nathan
and Alexander,

252
00:10:32,332 --> 00:10:34,732
I owe them closure.

253
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:36,446
And I'm the only one
who can give it to them.

254
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,569
I'm just trying to help you.

255
00:10:39,539 --> 00:10:41,259
You want to help me? Yeah.

256
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:44,291
How fast can you type?

257
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:47,679
Hot diggity.

258
00:10:47,748 --> 00:10:48,863
There it is.

259
00:10:50,784 --> 00:10:52,316
I ran into Altman,

260
00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:54,263
and she told me what you
were up to this morning.

261
00:10:54,287 --> 00:10:55,920
And I swear, I can't believe it.

262
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:57,522
It's astounding.

263
00:10:59,476 --> 00:11:02,176
What are you
working on over there?

264
00:11:02,245 --> 00:11:05,780
Um, Altman is offering to track
down surgeries I want to perform.

265
00:11:05,866 --> 00:11:07,698
Uh, may I?

266
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:10,368
No. This is... Thanks.

267
00:11:10,437 --> 00:11:12,737
Let's see what we got here.

268
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:17,375
Uh-huh.

269
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:24,615
Yang, what's wrong with you?
You're wasting an opportunity

270
00:11:24,685 --> 00:11:27,435
on 300 pages of
common procedure.

271
00:11:27,504 --> 00:11:30,071
She let a starving person
loose in a grocery store.

272
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:33,219
She asked what I want. I want
everything. What am I supposed to do?

273
00:11:33,243 --> 00:11:34,392
Get creative.

274
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,377
I mean, look at that.

275
00:11:37,647 --> 00:11:38,813
Okay.

276
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:42,270
It's the key. To what?

277
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:43,735
To the list.

278
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:45,453
So use it.

279
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:47,238
Use the key.

280
00:11:47,941 --> 00:11:49,824
Unlock your mind.

281
00:11:51,344 --> 00:11:53,504
What are you talking about?

282
00:11:54,114 --> 00:11:56,764
I'm just talking about
a heart-in-a-box.

283
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:01,936
A heart-in-a-box.

284
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:05,523
Hot diggity.

285
00:12:09,179 --> 00:12:11,257
It's such a treat, seeing
you again, Meredith.

286
00:12:11,281 --> 00:12:13,481
I want to hear everything.
How have you been?

287
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:14,699
Catch me up.

288
00:12:14,768 --> 00:12:15,934
I got married.

289
00:12:16,002 --> 00:12:18,653
Oh, that's wonderful. Any kids?

290
00:12:19,706 --> 00:12:21,656
No. We're working on it.

291
00:12:23,276 --> 00:12:24,842
Callie.

292
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:27,928
Oh, my God!

293
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:30,014
Mama O'Malley.

294
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,203
Hi.

295
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,901
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

296
00:12:32,969 --> 00:12:34,669
It's so good to see you.

297
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:38,189
I know. I haven't called,

298
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:39,602
and I meant to
call so many times,

299
00:12:39,626 --> 00:12:41,191
but you're here now, right now.

300
00:12:42,412 --> 00:12:44,290
Why are you here? Are
you okay? Is she okay, Grey?

301
00:12:44,314 --> 00:12:45,554
Yeah, we're hoping.

302
00:12:45,614 --> 00:12:46,842
I'm just waiting
for CT to open up.

303
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:48,215
Okay, good. Right. Good.

304
00:12:48,301 --> 00:12:50,221
Hello. Hi.

305
00:12:51,654 --> 00:12:52,970
Uh, oh, right. Sorry.

306
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:56,707
This is Dr. Robbins.

307
00:12:56,777 --> 00:12:58,242
Hi.

308
00:12:58,311 --> 00:12:59,643
Mmm-hmm.

309
00:13:00,614 --> 00:13:01,679
Louise O'Malley.

310
00:13:01,748 --> 00:13:02,748
Whoo! That's us.

311
00:13:02,816 --> 00:13:03,993
Good-bye, dear.

312
00:13:04,017 --> 00:13:06,300
It was really nice to see you.

313
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:07,680
You okay?

314
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:09,136
Yeah, I think so. Maybe?

315
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:10,482
Hold on. Yes.

316
00:13:10,506 --> 00:13:13,652
Polly? Okay, you're
here. I'm on my way.

317
00:13:13,676 --> 00:13:15,621
My prospective Peds
fellow's here, so I gotta run.

318
00:13:15,645 --> 00:13:16,922
Okay. I'll see you later.

319
00:13:16,946 --> 00:13:19,213
All right. Dr. Torres.

320
00:13:26,122 --> 00:13:27,738
Imagine my surprise

321
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:29,690
when I check out the
schedule expecting to see

322
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:31,593
Jackson Avery's name on it,

323
00:13:31,661 --> 00:13:34,462
only to find he's been
replaced by Alex Karev.

324
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:37,131
We've been preparing
this nerve graft for weeks.

325
00:13:37,217 --> 00:13:38,744
I know. I mean,
it's just you and me.

326
00:13:38,768 --> 00:13:40,368
The Plastics Posse,

327
00:13:40,436 --> 00:13:42,870
kicking surgical ass
and taking names.

328
00:13:42,939 --> 00:13:44,116
The Plastics Posse?

329
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:45,539
Just something I'm trying out.

330
00:13:45,608 --> 00:13:46,985
Look, Dr. Sloan, the thing is,

331
00:13:47,009 --> 00:13:48,087
I gotta get this paper
in by 7:00 tonight

332
00:13:48,111 --> 00:13:49,255
or I am screwed.

333
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:50,945
It's just bad timing.

334
00:13:51,031 --> 00:13:53,581
Wait. You're missing a
rock-star nerve graft for a paper?

335
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:55,216
I know. It's fifth year.

336
00:13:55,284 --> 00:13:58,324
You know? I can't
slack off now, right?

337
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,084
Oh, Dr. Torres.

338
00:14:13,136 --> 00:14:15,386
Oh, I'm sorry. I panicked.

339
00:14:15,455 --> 00:14:18,084
I didn't mean to introduce
you as Dr. Robbins.

340
00:14:18,108 --> 00:14:19,952
But I guess I didn't
know how to say,

341
00:14:19,976 --> 00:14:21,954
"Guess what, Mama O'Malley,

342
00:14:21,978 --> 00:14:25,663
"I'm into girls now,
and this is my wife."

343
00:14:25,732 --> 00:14:27,231
You know?

344
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,399
Polly.

345
00:14:28,467 --> 00:14:29,517
Yes, Dr. Robbins.

346
00:14:29,585 --> 00:14:30,625
I'm gonna need a minute.

347
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:32,036
Sure thing.

348
00:14:32,105 --> 00:14:33,865
I'm gonna go take a look at
your nuclear protein machines.

349
00:14:33,889 --> 00:14:35,022
Okay.

350
00:14:36,493 --> 00:14:37,619
Peds prospect Polly?

351
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:38,759
Yep.

352
00:14:38,828 --> 00:14:40,356
Oh, I'm doing so well today.

353
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:43,013
I get it. It's okay.

354
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:46,279
Wait. Really? 'Cause
you seemed kind of pissed.

355
00:14:46,303 --> 00:14:48,169
Really? I thought
I was being funny.

356
00:14:48,255 --> 00:14:50,871
Then you suck at jokes.

357
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:54,142
Look, coming out is
important. It's everything.

358
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:56,010
With your family
and your friends,

359
00:14:56,078 --> 00:14:57,923
I'd kick your ass if you
tried to hide me from them.

360
00:14:57,947 --> 00:15:00,531
But coming out to your dead
ex-husband's super-Catholic mom?

361
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,366
Not necessary. I
mean, not for you.

362
00:15:02,435 --> 00:15:04,369
And certainly not
for me. So it's okay.

363
00:15:05,872 --> 00:15:07,449
Thank you. Okay.

364
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:10,507
I'm gonna go find Polly
'cause I have no idea

365
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:13,177
where we'd keep the
nuclear protein machines.

366
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:14,378
Yeah.

367
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,282
Excuse me.

368
00:15:18,351 --> 00:15:20,196
Sloan will not
shut up about you.

369
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,663
I wouldn't have
taken the surgery

370
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:24,021
if I knew I was breaking
up the Plastics Posse.

371
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,570
He's using that in public now?

372
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:28,092
What? You're lucky.

373
00:15:28,161 --> 00:15:30,622
I wish I had an attending who
had my back like Sloan's got yours.

374
00:15:30,646 --> 00:15:32,008
Excuse me. No cuts.

375
00:15:32,032 --> 00:15:34,181
Sorry. I just gotta
get back to my patient.

376
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:36,627
Oh, my God. You guys
should read this. It's amazing.

377
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:37,896
Wait. Is that one of those books

378
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,448
about the time-traveling chick?

379
00:15:39,472 --> 00:15:41,317
Yeah, every other mom in
Peds has got one in her purse.

380
00:15:41,341 --> 00:15:43,190
Uh, 'cause they're awesome.

381
00:15:43,259 --> 00:15:45,338
I mean, one minute, Kate is
running through 1890s Paris

382
00:15:45,362 --> 00:15:47,878
with this pickpocket that
she loves but can't trust,

383
00:15:47,948 --> 00:15:49,926
and the next thing she knows,
she's being pulled across time,

384
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:52,483
dodging Nazis with this
adorable American G.I.

385
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:55,135
It's like <i>Slaughterhouse-Five,</i>
but totally hot.

386
00:15:55,205 --> 00:15:58,038
'Cause that's what
Vonnegut's missing, hotness.

387
00:15:58,107 --> 00:15:59,587
Okay, I gotta go.

388
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:08,199
Come on. Let's eat
somewhere else.

389
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:13,637
It's kind of soothing, like
sitting in front of a fish tank.

390
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:17,041
It's not a fish
tank. It's a key.

391
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:19,088
What's that supposed
to mean? Ask Webber.

392
00:16:19,112 --> 00:16:20,689
He came in here,
trashing my wish list,

393
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:22,959
and told me heart-in-a-box
was the key to fixing it.

394
00:16:22,983 --> 00:16:26,834
I'll tell you something,
she's not talking.

395
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:29,332
Heart-in-a-box, what
should I put on my wish list?

396
00:16:29,356 --> 00:16:31,956
Heart-in-a-box, what
should I put on my sandwich?

397
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,226
See? Nothing.

398
00:16:35,278 --> 00:16:38,179
Heart-in-a-box, what's
wrong with George's mom?

399
00:16:38,248 --> 00:16:39,413
Who's George?

400
00:16:39,482 --> 00:16:41,215
He used to work here. He died.

401
00:16:41,284 --> 00:16:42,394
Whoa. Who died?

402
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:43,551
George.

403
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,514
And we're talking about
that creep because?

404
00:16:45,538 --> 00:16:48,489
Alex, you're an ass.
His mom's in the hospital.

405
00:16:48,557 --> 00:16:50,820
Wow. O'Malley. I haven't
thought about him in...

406
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:52,777
Why would you? Alex.

407
00:16:52,846 --> 00:16:55,524
Come on. Don't act like you stay up
nights writing poetry about the guy.

408
00:16:55,548 --> 00:16:57,610
Remember when
you gave him syphilis?

409
00:16:57,634 --> 00:16:59,366
How... What?

410
00:16:59,436 --> 00:17:00,913
Remember heart-in-an-elevator?

411
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:03,921
Heart-in-an-elevator. I
should put that on my list.

412
00:17:03,973 --> 00:17:06,974
George made you
look like such a chump.

413
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,904
George was the
heart-in-the-elevator guy?

414
00:17:08,928 --> 00:17:11,090
I heard about that.
That sounded badass.

415
00:17:11,114 --> 00:17:12,879
Were you there?

416
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:15,748
I just wanted to eat my
freaking lunch. That's all.

417
00:17:20,657 --> 00:17:22,456
Wait. Wait. Everyone, shut up.

418
00:17:25,094 --> 00:17:26,694
Heart-in-a-box,

419
00:17:26,763 --> 00:17:28,128
heart-in-an-elevator?

420
00:17:35,588 --> 00:17:37,721
It works. It totally works.

421
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,506
Webber is a genius.

422
00:17:40,776 --> 00:17:43,110
Heart-in-a-box is
starting to creep me out.

423
00:17:43,179 --> 00:17:45,296
Don't talk about her that way.

424
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,369
Kate looked at Alexander
with pity more than anything.

425
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:54,405
"Fine," she said. "Go. Go
wherever the hell you want,

426
00:17:54,473 --> 00:17:56,857
"but first, you're
gonna apologize."

427
00:17:56,943 --> 00:17:58,042
Why?

428
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,159
Why what?

429
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:01,479
Why is he
apologizing? Alexander?

430
00:18:01,531 --> 00:18:03,759
Because he stole the ring that
Nathan gave her in book two.

431
00:18:03,783 --> 00:18:05,478
What? Nathan gave her a ring.

432
00:18:05,502 --> 00:18:07,819
Yes, he did, in book two.

433
00:18:07,871 --> 00:18:10,170
Does Alexander know
that Nathan gave it to her?

434
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:11,650
No, Dr. Grey, he is a thief.

435
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:14,107
If a thief sees a ring,
he's gonna take it.

436
00:18:14,177 --> 00:18:16,105
But he promised that
he was going to change.

437
00:18:16,129 --> 00:18:17,907
Dr. Grey. What?

438
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:19,375
I'm doing what
you told me to do.

439
00:18:19,399 --> 00:18:21,131
I told you to get her to the OR.

440
00:18:21,184 --> 00:18:22,950
You're hosting a book club.

441
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:24,864
She won't go into an OR
until she finishes her book.

442
00:18:24,888 --> 00:18:26,404
I'm helping her finish.

443
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:27,950
And how long will that take?

444
00:18:27,974 --> 00:18:30,841
You can't rush the
creative process.

445
00:18:38,634 --> 00:18:42,569
Grey, I asked you for preliminary
tests and hourly reports.

446
00:18:42,638 --> 00:18:45,940
What part of that did you interpret
as, "Also, if you find the time,

447
00:18:46,008 --> 00:18:48,220
"please shove a scope
down Mrs. O'Malley's throat"?

448
00:18:48,244 --> 00:18:49,526
Her endoscopic ultrasound

449
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:52,312
showed a 16-milimeter
dilation of the common duct.

450
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:54,710
I also did not ask for an
endoscopic ultrasound.

451
00:18:54,734 --> 00:18:58,552
See? Why can't you just do
the things that I ask you to do?

452
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:00,371
Oh, look. There.

453
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,939
See? She's got inflammation

454
00:19:02,008 --> 00:19:04,391
and scar tissue around
the remnant cystic duct.

455
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:05,870
She's gonna need
surgery. Wonderful.

456
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:08,841
You just proved that your
former colleague's mother

457
00:19:08,865 --> 00:19:10,992
had a botched surgery
at another hospital,

458
00:19:11,016 --> 00:19:13,329
a hospital that she only went to

459
00:19:13,353 --> 00:19:18,556
because we let her down
so shamefully in the past.

460
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:20,252
I just don't know why
you're celebrating.

461
00:19:20,276 --> 00:19:21,742
I'm not celebrating...

462
00:19:21,811 --> 00:19:24,328
Just go prep her for surgery.

463
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:26,763
Or is that too much to ask?

464
00:19:33,806 --> 00:19:36,674
You were amazing in there.

465
00:19:36,743 --> 00:19:38,409
I mean, from where
I was standing,

466
00:19:38,478 --> 00:19:40,622
it looked like you pretty
much rebuilt that guy's heart.

467
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:42,580
What do you call that again?

468
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:44,125
A modified Fontan procedure.

469
00:19:44,149 --> 00:19:45,616
Ah. After Dr. Fontan?

470
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:47,050
I can only assume.

471
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:48,719
I can only assume
that Dr. Fontan

472
00:19:48,788 --> 00:19:51,388
never looked as hot doing his
own procedure as my wife just did.

473
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,827
What happens in here?

474
00:20:04,637 --> 00:20:08,022
So the surgeons at Seattle
Pres left a length of cystic duct

475
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:09,301
inside of you when
they operated.

476
00:20:09,325 --> 00:20:10,535
That's what's causing
your problems.

477
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:11,837
So we're gonna take that out.

478
00:20:11,861 --> 00:20:12,904
Do you have any questions?

479
00:20:12,928 --> 00:20:14,394
I saw a ring.

480
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,713
Excuse me?

481
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:17,593
On Callie's finger, when
we ran into her earlier.

482
00:20:17,617 --> 00:20:19,733
Did she get remarried?

483
00:20:19,802 --> 00:20:22,414
She did. A few
months ago, actually.

484
00:20:22,438 --> 00:20:24,138
Oh! Oh, good.

485
00:20:24,207 --> 00:20:27,007
Do you think... Is she happy?
Oh, I hope she's happy.

486
00:20:27,093 --> 00:20:29,560
She seems happy.

487
00:20:29,629 --> 00:20:30,822
Do you have any questions
about your surgery?

488
00:20:30,846 --> 00:20:31,962
I raised a bunch of boys.

489
00:20:32,031 --> 00:20:34,214
It was so nice to
finally have a daughter.

490
00:20:34,283 --> 00:20:37,251
I miss her, all of you, really.

491
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,585
George's friends.

492
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:40,638
You were so important to him,

493
00:20:41,107 --> 00:20:43,057
to me.

494
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:45,693
You're doing exactly what
George would be doing,

495
00:20:45,778 --> 00:20:48,445
being in charge.

496
00:20:48,514 --> 00:20:51,048
Oh. You'll be doing my
surgery, won't you, dear?

497
00:20:51,117 --> 00:20:53,012
All by yourself. If
you're uncomfortable, I...

498
00:20:53,036 --> 00:20:55,286
No. No, don't be silly.
George said you were the best.

499
00:20:55,338 --> 00:20:57,955
I'm comfortable. I'm more
than comfortable. I'm ready.

500
00:20:58,024 --> 00:21:00,607
Let's do this.
Let's cut me open.

501
00:21:00,677 --> 00:21:03,522
I'm gonna need the
hand back for the surgery.

502
00:21:03,546 --> 00:21:04,795
Yeah.

503
00:21:12,154 --> 00:21:13,286
<i>Avery.</i>

504
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:15,222
We're about to get to
the hypoglossal nerve.

505
00:21:15,308 --> 00:21:17,369
Why don't you come down
here and get a closer look?

506
00:21:17,393 --> 00:21:20,193
<i>I'd just get in the way. I
can see fine from here.</i>

507
00:21:25,434 --> 00:21:27,768
You're a fool, Avery.

508
00:21:27,837 --> 00:21:31,388
Sitting in the gallery when
you should be grafting nerves?

509
00:21:32,258 --> 00:21:33,790
You're lost.

510
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:35,019
Adrift.

511
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:36,593
You know what you need?

512
00:21:37,263 --> 00:21:39,196
No, sir. I don't.

513
00:21:39,248 --> 00:21:41,659
You need to see heart-in-a-box.

514
00:21:41,683 --> 00:21:43,016
Yeah, I've seen it.

515
00:21:43,085 --> 00:21:44,584
Maybe you looked at it.

516
00:21:44,653 --> 00:21:46,732
But if you really saw it,

517
00:21:46,756 --> 00:21:49,589
you'd be down in
that OR right now.

518
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:52,142
See it, Avery.

519
00:21:53,513 --> 00:21:55,579
See heart-in-a-box.

520
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,105
Any idea what's
going on with Avery?

521
00:22:10,129 --> 00:22:11,845
He seems so distant.

522
00:22:11,914 --> 00:22:13,509
You want me to put
a note in his locker?

523
00:22:13,533 --> 00:22:15,594
What's that? You want
me to suture in the graft?

524
00:22:15,618 --> 00:22:16,934
No, I'll handle that.

525
00:22:22,024 --> 00:22:23,557
What did you find?

526
00:22:23,626 --> 00:22:26,426
There were retained stones
blocking her cystic duct remnant.

527
00:22:26,495 --> 00:22:28,073
Oh. Okay. That's
not super serious.

528
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:29,675
She should be okay,
right? Yeah, she'll be fine.

529
00:22:29,699 --> 00:22:31,109
Okay, good. Thanks. Yeah.

530
00:22:31,133 --> 00:22:33,433
Oh, uh, she knows
you're married.

531
00:22:33,502 --> 00:22:36,069
What? How? How did she find...

532
00:22:36,138 --> 00:22:37,982
She saw your ring this morning.

533
00:22:38,006 --> 00:22:39,868
She asked me, and all I
said is that you were happy.

534
00:22:39,892 --> 00:22:41,408
It's not your place
to say anything.

535
00:22:41,477 --> 00:22:43,205
She's going into
surgery, and she's scared,

536
00:22:43,229 --> 00:22:44,873
and she's alone
and she misses you.

537
00:22:44,897 --> 00:22:46,408
I know it's complicated,

538
00:22:46,432 --> 00:22:48,510
but I don't think it would be
a bad thing if you were there

539
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:50,894
to hold her hand
when she woke up.

540
00:22:57,009 --> 00:22:58,042
You got a second?

541
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:59,350
Wait just one second.

542
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:00,388
I'm a little worried
about Avery.

543
00:23:00,412 --> 00:23:01,657
I'm this close to getting this.

544
00:23:01,681 --> 00:23:02,841
We had a real
connection, you know?

545
00:23:02,865 --> 00:23:04,465
Okay.

546
00:23:04,533 --> 00:23:06,633
We were having such
a good time together,

547
00:23:06,702 --> 00:23:09,103
and suddenly he's avoiding me.

548
00:23:09,171 --> 00:23:11,605
He's cold and distant.

549
00:23:11,674 --> 00:23:13,735
You're afraid you're about to
have your heart broken by him.

550
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:14,858
Kind of.

551
00:23:14,927 --> 00:23:16,127
Derek, you know me.

552
00:23:16,195 --> 00:23:18,545
I never gave a crap
about teaching in my life,

553
00:23:18,631 --> 00:23:21,565
but lately, I like the
idea of passing it on.

554
00:23:21,634 --> 00:23:24,818
And I, you know, I
want to see him do well.

555
00:23:24,887 --> 00:23:27,204
Maybe I just need to back off.

556
00:23:27,273 --> 00:23:28,989
Ah, Hunt. Just in time.

557
00:23:29,058 --> 00:23:33,176
Mark is afraid that Avery
is gonna break up with him.

558
00:23:33,229 --> 00:23:35,090
Can this just stay
between you and me?

559
00:23:35,114 --> 00:23:37,397
I'd prefer that. Shepherd,
about these cases...

560
00:23:37,483 --> 00:23:39,182
I know what you're gonna say.

561
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:40,745
You're worried about the
hospital's mortality rate going up.

562
00:23:40,769 --> 00:23:42,769
See, that's the worst
part about being chief.

563
00:23:42,805 --> 00:23:44,215
You have to say no to
everybody, and they hate you for it.

564
00:23:44,239 --> 00:23:46,134
And you say no enough,
you're gonna hate yourself,

565
00:23:46,158 --> 00:23:48,809
which is why I'm not gonna
watch you go through this.

566
00:23:48,878 --> 00:23:50,077
I have a consult.

567
00:23:50,162 --> 00:23:51,640
If you love someone,
set them free.

568
00:23:51,664 --> 00:23:53,229
If they come back...

569
00:23:53,299 --> 00:23:54,848
I'm gonna punch you.

570
00:23:56,552 --> 00:23:58,034
Let me ask you something.

571
00:23:58,087 --> 00:23:59,087
No.

572
00:24:02,791 --> 00:24:04,769
I gotta say, I'm a big fan of
what happens in this room.

573
00:24:04,793 --> 00:24:07,953
Every day should be bring
your husband to work day.

574
00:24:08,898 --> 00:24:10,564
Listen, I've had this idea.

575
00:24:10,649 --> 00:24:13,617
I felt silly even
considering it.

576
00:24:13,685 --> 00:24:15,119
Like, really?

577
00:24:15,187 --> 00:24:17,104
You think that's
something you're gonna do?

578
00:24:17,189 --> 00:24:19,790
But now, though, I'm
thinking I really want to do it.

579
00:24:21,226 --> 00:24:22,706
I want to go back to school.

580
00:24:24,163 --> 00:24:26,663
Oh. Okay. I mean...

581
00:24:26,732 --> 00:24:28,176
I mean, that's not silly.

582
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,411
Adults go back to
school all the time.

583
00:24:30,435 --> 00:24:32,202
Medical school.

584
00:24:32,271 --> 00:24:33,537
Wow.

585
00:24:34,273 --> 00:24:35,505
I mean...

586
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:39,059
Wow. Yeah.

587
00:24:39,128 --> 00:24:42,229
What time is it?

588
00:24:42,298 --> 00:24:45,310
We got another surgery to get
to. Come on. Up and at them.

589
00:24:45,334 --> 00:24:47,779
<i>Kate couldn't keep it
to herself any longer.</i>

590
00:24:47,803 --> 00:24:49,603
She took him by the hand

591
00:24:49,672 --> 00:24:52,740
and looked deep into
those ocean blue eyes.

592
00:24:52,808 --> 00:24:56,310
"I have figured out why I
travel through time, Nathan.

593
00:24:56,395 --> 00:24:59,441
"I have figured it out, and
now I know how I can stop it."

594
00:24:59,465 --> 00:25:00,998
Oh, my God.

595
00:25:01,066 --> 00:25:03,934
"I can choose where
to be, when to be,

596
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:06,170
"and I have chosen."

597
00:25:06,238 --> 00:25:08,021
Oh, my God. Yes.

598
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:10,385
Nathan pulled her into
his arms and held on tightly.

599
00:25:10,409 --> 00:25:13,010
Kate whispered
against his chest,

600
00:25:13,078 --> 00:25:15,979
"I'm sorry. I am so, so sorry."

601
00:25:16,048 --> 00:25:17,247
Wait. What?

602
00:25:17,316 --> 00:25:18,693
She'd never know
if he heard her.

603
00:25:18,717 --> 00:25:20,433
When she opened her eyes,

604
00:25:20,502 --> 00:25:22,102
Nathan was gone.

605
00:25:22,171 --> 00:25:23,770
She was in Paris.

606
00:25:23,839 --> 00:25:26,189
It was time to
look for Alexander.

607
00:25:26,258 --> 00:25:27,440
What?

608
00:25:27,509 --> 00:25:29,076
She chooses Alexander?

609
00:25:29,144 --> 00:25:30,177
No!

610
00:25:30,262 --> 00:25:32,129
No way. It has to be Nathan.

611
00:25:32,198 --> 00:25:33,697
It's not Nathan.

612
00:25:33,766 --> 00:25:36,566
But he's so handsome and good.

613
00:25:36,635 --> 00:25:38,051
And Alexander...

614
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,385
Is her soul mate.

615
00:25:39,454 --> 00:25:40,938
He doesn't even have a soul.

616
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:42,289
I mean, he's a criminal.

617
00:25:42,358 --> 00:25:44,557
They don't even
want the same things.

618
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:46,138
They make each other miserable.

619
00:25:46,162 --> 00:25:48,440
Dr. Grey, I cannot
betray my characters.

620
00:25:48,464 --> 00:25:49,629
You're the writer.

621
00:25:49,698 --> 00:25:51,598
You can make them
do whatever you want.

622
00:25:51,667 --> 00:25:52,832
And picking Nathan,

623
00:25:52,918 --> 00:25:54,229
that is the right thing to do.

624
00:25:54,253 --> 00:25:55,468
Oh!

625
00:25:55,555 --> 00:25:56,954
You hate it. No, I know.

626
00:25:57,023 --> 00:25:58,483
No, no. You hate it.

627
00:25:58,507 --> 00:25:59,923
Oh, God.

628
00:25:59,992 --> 00:26:01,403
Okay, page Shepherd. Now.

629
00:26:01,427 --> 00:26:02,609
I think her aneurysm blew.

630
00:26:06,364 --> 00:26:08,164
Suction.

631
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:10,651
Oh, damn. It's a big bleed.

632
00:26:10,719 --> 00:26:12,230
If you had spent less
time taking dictation,

633
00:26:12,254 --> 00:26:13,654
we could've avoided this.

634
00:26:13,722 --> 00:26:15,242
Did she at least
finish the book?

635
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:18,691
No, but she did tell me how
it's gonna end. It's so stupid.

636
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:22,613
She's written this incredible story
with these amazing characters,

637
00:26:22,681 --> 00:26:24,593
and then she just blows it.

638
00:26:24,617 --> 00:26:26,066
Wow. You're 15 right now.

639
00:26:26,134 --> 00:26:27,612
It's criminal, what she's doing.

640
00:26:27,636 --> 00:26:29,480
And when she wakes
up, I'm gonna tell her that.

641
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:31,104
Or maybe it's none
of your business.

642
00:26:31,173 --> 00:26:33,352
It's the same thing that you are
doing with these hopeless cases.

643
00:26:33,376 --> 00:26:34,969
You know, you think
that you can change

644
00:26:34,993 --> 00:26:36,638
the way the patient's
story is gonna end.

645
00:26:36,662 --> 00:26:37,944
And if you think that,

646
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:39,674
then you're at least
obligated to try.

647
00:26:39,698 --> 00:26:42,082
So I gotta try, right?

648
00:26:42,651 --> 00:26:43,701
Yes.

649
00:26:53,562 --> 00:26:55,323
You double-checked
her labs and scans?

650
00:26:55,347 --> 00:26:56,696
Yes, of course.

651
00:26:56,765 --> 00:26:59,666
I just don't want any
surprises once I'm in there.

652
00:26:59,735 --> 00:27:03,870
Actually, she thought I'd
be performing her surgery.

653
00:27:03,939 --> 00:27:05,472
Oh, I'm not
comfortable with that.

654
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:07,469
I can do a septoplasty.
You taught me a septoplasty.

655
00:27:07,493 --> 00:27:09,360
I thought I taught
you a lot of things.

656
00:27:09,428 --> 00:27:13,313
Now I'm thinking, I must not
be much of a teacher at all.

657
00:27:16,385 --> 00:27:18,752
I'm going to court tomorrow,

658
00:27:18,821 --> 00:27:21,483
to prove to a judge that's never
met me that I'm a good person,

659
00:27:21,507 --> 00:27:23,624
a fit mother.

660
00:27:23,692 --> 00:27:26,459
I want my kid back so badly,
I'm racking my brain for anything

661
00:27:26,528 --> 00:27:28,912
that'll make him
see me that way.

662
00:27:28,981 --> 00:27:31,509
I want to dress the part, so
I'm thinking my navy dress.

663
00:27:31,533 --> 00:27:33,578
But there's a button missing,
and it shows too much cleavage.

664
00:27:33,602 --> 00:27:35,919
My charcoal pants
have a hole in the ass.

665
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:38,288
I've got one shot at this.

666
00:27:38,357 --> 00:27:39,456
I'm useless

667
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,542
and frustrated.

668
00:27:42,611 --> 00:27:45,974
But I know how to do an ERCP and
I know when to double-check labs.

669
00:27:45,998 --> 00:27:47,926
And I know how
to do a septoplasty.

670
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:50,183
I'm not useless here.

671
00:27:58,094 --> 00:28:00,060
Fine. Do the surgery.

672
00:28:06,602 --> 00:28:09,202
Off-pump coronary bypass.

673
00:28:12,557 --> 00:28:13,973
No.

674
00:28:15,928 --> 00:28:17,861
En bloc transplant,

675
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:20,463
heart and both lungs.

676
00:28:23,852 --> 00:28:25,185
Yes.

677
00:28:25,254 --> 00:28:27,403
I don't get it.

678
00:28:27,472 --> 00:28:29,935
I mean, Webber talks about
this thing like it's a Magic 8 Ball.

679
00:28:29,959 --> 00:28:31,491
It's a heart

680
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:34,161
in a box.

681
00:28:34,229 --> 00:28:36,775
Okay, when you take an organ
out for transplant, what do you do?

682
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:38,476
Put it on ice. Yeah,
you put it on ice

683
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,261
and run to place it in
the recipient's body,

684
00:28:40,285 --> 00:28:44,421
and then you wait and
hope for this cold, dead heart

685
00:28:44,489 --> 00:28:46,322
to warm up and come
back to life, right?

686
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:47,891
But she... She?

687
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,393
She has never stopped beating.

688
00:28:49,461 --> 00:28:52,212
She's never stopped being
warm, never stopped living.

689
00:28:52,297 --> 00:28:54,777
Sure, it's pretty... It's a
frigging miracle. Okay?

690
00:28:54,817 --> 00:28:56,727
You're standing
before a miracle.

691
00:28:56,751 --> 00:28:59,369
And once you realize that,

692
00:28:59,438 --> 00:29:01,238
she'll change your perspective.

693
00:29:02,491 --> 00:29:03,907
Okay, here's what I do.

694
00:29:03,976 --> 00:29:05,925
I look at an item on my list,

695
00:29:05,995 --> 00:29:07,911
I look at heart-in-a-box.

696
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:13,183
And if that surgery on my list
isn't half as cool as heart-in-a-box,

697
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:15,168
then it is not worth my time.

698
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:18,989
She lets you know what's
most important to you.

699
00:29:19,041 --> 00:29:21,374
That's what heart-in-a-box does.

700
00:29:23,379 --> 00:29:24,578
And she's nice to talk to.

701
00:29:24,646 --> 00:29:26,312
Shut up. Shut up.

702
00:29:28,834 --> 00:29:31,585
What do you think about
the University of Washington?

703
00:29:31,653 --> 00:29:32,952
Um, I'm not sure.

704
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:35,705
It's not like Harvard
or Stanford. It feels...

705
00:29:35,775 --> 00:29:37,707
I don't know. It feels doable.

706
00:29:38,543 --> 00:29:39,910
Doable?

707
00:29:39,979 --> 00:29:42,980
Okay, I'm sorry, but...

708
00:29:43,048 --> 00:29:46,494
Medical school isn't something
that you just decide to do.

709
00:29:46,518 --> 00:29:48,668
Really? How did
it happen for you?

710
00:29:48,737 --> 00:29:50,336
The Lady of the Lake appeared

711
00:29:50,406 --> 00:29:52,200
with a gilded scalpel and
anointed you a med student?

712
00:29:52,224 --> 00:29:53,240
Ha-ha.

713
00:29:53,308 --> 00:29:55,041
I'm actually being
serious right now.

714
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:57,338
I mean, how is my decision to go to
med school any different than yours?

715
00:29:57,362 --> 00:29:59,613
First of all, I was 19.

716
00:29:59,698 --> 00:30:01,632
All right, great. So
I'm old. What else?

717
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,233
Uh, I don't know.

718
00:30:03,302 --> 00:30:05,680
Have you taken your
three years of prerequisites?

719
00:30:05,704 --> 00:30:07,437
How about the MCAT?

720
00:30:07,506 --> 00:30:08,950
No, I have not, but I do
have a college degree.

721
00:30:08,974 --> 00:30:10,351
I may have been
a baseball player,

722
00:30:10,375 --> 00:30:11,686
but I think I remember
how to study.

723
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:13,321
Okay, that still doesn't account

724
00:30:13,345 --> 00:30:14,906
for the four years
of actual med school.

725
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:16,858
And if you decide to
go completely crazy

726
00:30:16,882 --> 00:30:18,860
and you want to try
to become a surgeon,

727
00:30:18,884 --> 00:30:22,168
that's five years of
residency, a fellowship...

728
00:30:22,238 --> 00:30:23,915
No, I never said I
wanted to be a surgeon.

729
00:30:23,939 --> 00:30:25,917
There are plenty of other
ways to use a medical education.

730
00:30:25,941 --> 00:30:27,558
Okay, fine.

731
00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:29,109
Fine.

732
00:30:30,713 --> 00:30:33,847
I love the way things
are right now. I really do.

733
00:30:33,916 --> 00:30:38,118
And I don't want to spend ten
years married to a med student.

734
00:30:38,186 --> 00:30:40,837
No. You'd just rather I followed
you around, looking cute.

735
00:30:40,906 --> 00:30:42,239
Okay, you know what?

736
00:30:42,307 --> 00:30:43,384
You know that that's
not what I'm saying.

737
00:30:43,408 --> 00:30:44,641
I was gonna die.

738
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:46,726
My disease was going to kill me.

739
00:30:47,729 --> 00:30:49,596
And then I met you.

740
00:30:49,665 --> 00:30:51,865
You came into my life, and
suddenly I have insurance,

741
00:30:51,934 --> 00:30:55,402
I have a wife, I have a life expectancy
beyond the next three months.

742
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:57,081
Sue me if I don't
want to waste any of it.

743
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:58,985
Henry, I... Just...

744
00:30:59,425 --> 00:31:01,191
I'll see you at home.

745
00:31:07,783 --> 00:31:10,850
Okay, probe passes easily
through the common duct.

746
00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:14,104
One more biopsy, and I
think we're ready to close.

747
00:31:17,309 --> 00:31:20,893
Dr. Bailey, is there something
wrong? Did I miss something?

748
00:31:20,963 --> 00:31:25,582
This woman worked
so hard to raise her son,

749
00:31:25,651 --> 00:31:28,551
and then one day, he just
threw himself in front of a bus.

750
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:32,305
I mean, yeah, yeah, he did it
to save someone else, but...

751
00:31:33,408 --> 00:31:36,059
You work and work,

752
00:31:36,128 --> 00:31:38,895
trying to teach your
kids to do the right thing,

753
00:31:38,964 --> 00:31:41,397
and you want to
be so proud of them

754
00:31:41,466 --> 00:31:44,946
when they stand up for
what they believe is right.

755
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:48,588
But watching them
destroy themselves

756
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:50,323
in order to do it,

757
00:31:50,392 --> 00:31:52,552
to do what you taught them,

758
00:31:53,728 --> 00:31:56,112
it's just maddening.

759
00:31:56,181 --> 00:31:58,782
You. You are maddening.

760
00:32:03,038 --> 00:32:04,587
He was my favorite.

761
00:32:04,656 --> 00:32:06,973
George O'Malley.

762
00:32:07,042 --> 00:32:10,827
He was. My favorite.

763
00:32:13,198 --> 00:32:14,697
I know.

764
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:16,532
He was the good one.

765
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,671
So I'm going to put in a T-tube.

766
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:24,457
Wear a sweater set.

767
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:30,058
People have preconceived
notions about surgeons.

768
00:32:30,082 --> 00:32:34,017
They think we're cold,
intimidating, egotistical.

769
00:32:34,069 --> 00:32:37,637
A sweater set says
you're warm, motherly.

770
00:32:37,706 --> 00:32:39,786
If it was me, I'd
wear a sweater set.

771
00:32:41,243 --> 00:32:42,909
Thank you.

772
00:32:50,202 --> 00:32:51,902
You paged?

773
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,770
I can't get outta here yet.

774
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:55,250
I gotta follow up
with my patient,

775
00:32:55,274 --> 00:32:56,901
make sure she's in
her right frame of mind.

776
00:32:56,925 --> 00:32:58,892
Yeah.

777
00:32:58,961 --> 00:32:59,993
You okay?

778
00:33:01,597 --> 00:33:03,717
Yeah, I missed a
surgery today that...

779
00:33:04,215 --> 00:33:05,682
That's not true.

780
00:33:05,751 --> 00:33:08,685
I avoided a surgery today,
one I wanted to do for weeks,

781
00:33:08,754 --> 00:33:10,632
because of this thing
with you and Mark.

782
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:12,488
There is nothing
between me and Mark.

783
00:33:12,557 --> 00:33:15,319
Yeah, I've been trying really,
really hard to believe that.

784
00:33:15,343 --> 00:33:17,077
But there is a thing.

785
00:33:17,145 --> 00:33:19,812
And it's not going
anywhere anytime soon.

786
00:33:19,881 --> 00:33:22,599
And this new thing
with me and Plastics?

787
00:33:22,668 --> 00:33:24,828
That's not going away either.

788
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:27,219
Something's gotta budge.

789
00:33:30,342 --> 00:33:32,325
So I have to walk away

790
00:33:34,096 --> 00:33:36,829
from you, for me.

791
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:40,016
So...

792
00:33:40,085 --> 00:33:42,953
You're picking Mark?

793
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:46,261
I've spent way too much time
sabotaging my own career, Lex.

794
00:33:47,642 --> 00:33:48,809
Yeah,

795
00:33:50,578 --> 00:33:52,345
I'm picking Mark.

796
00:33:57,953 --> 00:34:00,286
Can you tell me I shouldn't?

797
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:20,590
Heard a helicopter
touched down on the roof.

798
00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:23,960
Let them come. You were right.

799
00:34:25,246 --> 00:34:27,280
She was the key.

800
00:34:37,175 --> 00:34:39,059
Now this is a fine list.

801
00:34:39,127 --> 00:34:40,994
Thank you, sir.

802
00:34:47,435 --> 00:34:48,735
You made a list, too?

803
00:34:48,804 --> 00:34:50,536
I was inspired.

804
00:34:54,409 --> 00:34:56,710
Oh, oh, I want to
put this on my list.

805
00:34:56,778 --> 00:34:59,418
If one of those comes in, we'll
have to see who gets to it first.

806
00:35:00,365 --> 00:35:01,381
Okay.

807
00:35:01,449 --> 00:35:02,449
Okay.

808
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:04,717
Hi.

809
00:35:04,786 --> 00:35:06,887
We're the procurement
team from Columbia.

810
00:35:06,955 --> 00:35:08,105
She's all yours.

811
00:35:10,325 --> 00:35:11,691
Heart-in-a-box.

812
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,109
Hot diggity.

813
00:35:19,267 --> 00:35:20,984
How are you feeling?

814
00:35:21,052 --> 00:35:23,737
Like a woman who
just had brain surgery.

815
00:35:23,805 --> 00:35:25,955
Fair enough. Can
you tell me your name?

816
00:35:26,024 --> 00:35:28,909
Justine Campbell.

817
00:35:28,977 --> 00:35:31,745
And what's today's date?

818
00:35:31,813 --> 00:35:33,930
I never know the date.
Ask me something else.

819
00:35:33,999 --> 00:35:35,560
Why can't Kate choose Nathan?

820
00:35:35,584 --> 00:35:37,316
She's going to.

821
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:38,813
I just feel like you have
a moral obligation to...

822
00:35:38,837 --> 00:35:40,203
Wait, really?

823
00:35:40,255 --> 00:35:42,188
Yeah. For now.

824
00:35:42,257 --> 00:35:44,474
I had a dream while I
was under, and I figured out

825
00:35:44,543 --> 00:35:47,561
how to stretch the series
out two or three more books.

826
00:35:47,629 --> 00:35:49,462
So... For now,

827
00:35:49,531 --> 00:35:50,775
she'll get to see what it
feels like to be with Nathan.

828
00:35:50,799 --> 00:35:52,765
So... What?

829
00:35:52,851 --> 00:35:54,895
They're gonna be
together for a few books,

830
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:57,754
and then she's gonna
choose Alexander?

831
00:35:57,823 --> 00:35:58,954
Yeah, probably.

832
00:35:59,024 --> 00:36:01,241
What is wrong with you?

833
00:36:01,309 --> 00:36:03,171
I mean, why do you
hate Nathan so much?

834
00:36:03,195 --> 00:36:05,094
I don't hate Nathan.

835
00:36:05,164 --> 00:36:06,613
I love him,

836
00:36:06,698 --> 00:36:08,765
probably as much
as you apparently do.

837
00:36:08,834 --> 00:36:11,067
He's kind and funny

838
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:13,336
and incredibly honest.

839
00:36:13,404 --> 00:36:15,104
It's Kate.

840
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:17,874
She doesn't love him.

841
00:36:17,943 --> 00:36:19,642
She should.

842
00:36:19,711 --> 00:36:20,776
I know.

843
00:36:20,846 --> 00:36:22,278
It's not fair.

844
00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:23,980
I know.

845
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:29,485
But it makes for a
really, really good read.

846
00:36:35,076 --> 00:36:36,409
Come here.

847
00:36:41,567 --> 00:36:44,284
Do you want to work on
the book a little bit more?

848
00:36:44,369 --> 00:36:46,186
Will that make you feel better?

849
00:36:49,608 --> 00:36:50,640
Okay.

850
00:37:02,904 --> 00:37:04,103
Callie.

851
00:37:06,975 --> 00:37:08,991
Meredith said the
surgery went great.

852
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,660
Oh. Yeah.

853
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:13,513
I like girls.

854
00:37:13,581 --> 00:37:16,299
As in, romantically.

855
00:37:16,351 --> 00:37:17,984
It turns out, I like girls.

856
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:19,819
Uh, women.

857
00:37:19,905 --> 00:37:22,756
And I met the most
amazing woman.

858
00:37:22,824 --> 00:37:25,058
Do you remember
Dr. Robbins from this morning?

859
00:37:25,127 --> 00:37:26,826
Yeah, we got married, and...

860
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:28,844
Oh, no, but before that,

861
00:37:28,914 --> 00:37:30,880
we got in an accident,
a car accident,

862
00:37:30,949 --> 00:37:33,349
a really bad accident,
and I almost died.

863
00:37:33,418 --> 00:37:35,368
But I didn't, and Sofia,

864
00:37:35,454 --> 00:37:37,637
neither did Sofia, our baby,

865
00:37:37,706 --> 00:37:41,024
our perfect, beautiful baby.

866
00:37:41,093 --> 00:37:46,195
And I'm screwing all this up.

867
00:37:47,766 --> 00:37:48,965
Look, I...

868
00:37:51,486 --> 00:37:52,985
I know this is a lot.

869
00:37:53,055 --> 00:37:55,488
And I understand.

870
00:37:55,557 --> 00:37:58,090
Um, and if this is too
much for you to handle,

871
00:37:58,159 --> 00:37:59,458
believe me...

872
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:00,955
My own mother
practically disowned me,

873
00:38:00,979 --> 00:38:04,113
so I understand.

874
00:38:04,182 --> 00:38:07,133
Oh, God. I'm making you cry.

875
00:38:07,202 --> 00:38:08,868
Please don't cry.

876
00:38:09,854 --> 00:38:11,671
You have a baby?

877
00:38:13,341 --> 00:38:14,958
I do.

878
00:38:15,026 --> 00:38:16,592
Do you have any pictures?

879
00:38:18,964 --> 00:38:20,262
You want to see them?

880
00:38:20,332 --> 00:38:21,580
Are you kidding?

881
00:38:23,835 --> 00:38:24,884
Okay.

882
00:38:38,366 --> 00:38:39,733
She's beautiful.

883
00:38:39,801 --> 00:38:41,434
Thank you.

884
00:38:46,374 --> 00:38:48,758
That man just booked
a flight from Wichita.

885
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:50,771
You want to tell him no,
I'll give you his number.

886
00:38:50,795 --> 00:38:52,127
You can tell him yourself.

887
00:38:52,196 --> 00:38:54,225
I'm not worried about the
hospital's mortality rates, Derek.

888
00:38:54,249 --> 00:38:55,681
I'm worried about you.

889
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,594
You've had a lot
of losses this year,

890
00:38:57,618 --> 00:39:00,581
and I am concerned that
you're lining yourself up for more.

891
00:39:00,605 --> 00:39:02,166
You're worried
about my reputation.

892
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:03,310
There is that.

893
00:39:03,358 --> 00:39:04,924
I don't have a
reputation anymore.

894
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:07,050
See, I was gonna be the
guy who cured Alzheimer's.

895
00:39:07,112 --> 00:39:09,012
Now I am blacklisted by the FDA,

896
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,747
so I don't have to worry
about that anymore.

897
00:39:11,816 --> 00:39:14,717
I get to choose
what I worry about.

898
00:39:14,785 --> 00:39:19,588
And I choose them. I feel
I can change their story.

899
00:39:19,657 --> 00:39:22,726
I owe it to them
to at least try.

900
00:39:22,794 --> 00:39:26,124
That's pretty damned
arrogant, don't you think?

901
00:39:26,148 --> 00:39:29,482
I have a reputation
for arrogance.

902
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,460
Could I have a Cabernet?

903
00:39:40,529 --> 00:39:42,039
Actually, make that
a Scotch and soda.

904
00:39:42,063 --> 00:39:43,512
Okay.

905
00:39:43,581 --> 00:39:46,282
You know what? Forget the soda.

906
00:39:47,786 --> 00:39:49,652
Hi, it's me.

907
00:39:49,721 --> 00:39:51,721
Turns out today was a bust.

908
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:53,522
She kept going on about this guy

909
00:39:53,592 --> 00:39:55,240
who helped these kids in Africa.

910
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:58,178
And I was like, "Have you
seen my three articles?"

911
00:39:59,414 --> 00:40:01,080
But apparently, this
guy craps puppies,

912
00:40:01,149 --> 00:40:03,549
so who cares about me?

913
00:40:03,618 --> 00:40:07,320
Anyway, my plane
lands at 10:00, so wait up.

914
00:40:07,388 --> 00:40:11,257
I'm gonna be drunk
and I'm gonna cry.

915
00:40:11,326 --> 00:40:13,693
Just warning you.

916
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:20,583
I have to catch a plane.

917
00:40:20,652 --> 00:40:22,612
Keep the change. MAN: Thanks.

918
00:40:26,291 --> 00:40:27,557
Avery, wait up.

919
00:40:27,626 --> 00:40:28,958
Oh, right, Dr. Sloan.

920
00:40:29,026 --> 00:40:30,655
You need to talk to me...
I am sorry about today...

921
00:40:30,679 --> 00:40:31,994
No, I'm sorry. It was my...

922
00:40:32,063 --> 00:40:33,457
No, you don't have
anything to be sorry about.

923
00:40:33,481 --> 00:40:34,909
No, I think I should
apologize to you for...

924
00:40:34,933 --> 00:40:37,433
No, it wasn't you. It
was me. I have been...

925
00:40:37,502 --> 00:40:39,413
I just think we had some... I
don't want to screw things up.

926
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,236
Okay, I'm gonna talk,
then you talk, okay?

927
00:40:41,305 --> 00:40:42,388
Okay.

928
00:40:43,758 --> 00:40:45,169
I want to be your teacher.

929
00:40:45,193 --> 00:40:46,620
I want to be your student.

930
00:40:46,644 --> 00:40:49,262
I have a cranial vault
reconstruction tomorrow.

931
00:40:49,331 --> 00:40:50,530
I will be there.

932
00:40:50,598 --> 00:40:51,909
Good. Good.

933
00:40:51,933 --> 00:40:53,966
Great.

934
00:40:54,035 --> 00:40:57,203
I guess the Plastics
Posse is back in action.

935
00:40:57,272 --> 00:40:59,372
Kicking surgical ass
and taking names.

936
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:00,690
All...

937
00:41:00,758 --> 00:41:01,957
Just... All right.

938
00:41:02,026 --> 00:41:03,438
Just do that. Yeah.

939
00:41:03,462 --> 00:41:05,378
Great. Okay. All right.

940
00:41:07,265 --> 00:41:08,998
Drive safe.

941
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:10,950
<i>It's a little bit horrifying</i>

942
00:41:11,019 --> 00:41:13,252
<i>just how quickly
everything can fall to crap.</i>

943
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:15,399
O'Malley wasn't a creep, okay?

944
00:41:15,423 --> 00:41:18,335
If he were here now, he'd
be kicking all of our asses.

945
00:41:18,359 --> 00:41:21,472
He would've slapped chief
resident right out of Kepner's hand.

946
00:41:21,496 --> 00:41:22,790
I just don't like
thinking about him

947
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:24,325
because then I have
to think about Izzie,

948
00:41:24,349 --> 00:41:27,116
and then I get all
sad and sappy and...

949
00:41:27,185 --> 00:41:29,430
I totally miss the chance
to nail hot, drunk chicks

950
00:41:29,454 --> 00:41:31,787
who spent the day thinking
about how I'm awesome,

951
00:41:31,857 --> 00:41:34,138
which I should be all about.

952
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:38,878
George is dead, and Izzie is
gone, and we're all different.

953
00:41:40,314 --> 00:41:41,614
We're different.

954
00:41:41,682 --> 00:41:44,099
<i>Sometimes it takes a huge loss</i>

955
00:41:44,169 --> 00:41:46,802
<i>to remind you of what
you care about the most.</i>

956
00:41:46,871 --> 00:41:50,206
<i>Sometimes you find yourself
becoming stronger as a result,</i>

957
00:41:50,275 --> 00:41:52,175
<i>wiser, better equipped</i>

958
00:41:52,243 --> 00:41:55,203
<i>to deal with the next big
disaster that comes along.</i>

959
00:41:56,481 --> 00:41:58,659
That was our first real fight.

960
00:42:01,035 --> 00:42:02,418
You okay?

961
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:08,402
Okay, okay, okay,
okay. It's okay.

962
00:42:08,426 --> 00:42:09,720
Okay. You're gonna be okay.

963
00:42:09,744 --> 00:42:10,954
It's okay. It's okay.

964
00:42:10,978 --> 00:42:12,673
<i>Sometimes...</i> Look at me.

965
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:13,962
You're gonna be okay.

966
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:16,332
<i>But not always.</i>
