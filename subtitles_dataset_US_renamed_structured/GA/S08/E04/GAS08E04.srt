1
00:00:12,146 --> 00:00:13,724
What are you starting with?

2
00:00:13,748 --> 00:00:15,748
Laminectomy.

3
00:00:15,816 --> 00:00:17,594
Are you doing it open
or endoscopically?

4
00:00:17,618 --> 00:00:19,138
You know what?
I'm not gonna do this.

5
00:00:20,454 --> 00:00:21,520
What?

6
00:00:21,589 --> 00:00:22,699
You're the one who left neuro.

7
00:00:22,723 --> 00:00:23,872
I know.

8
00:00:23,941 --> 00:00:25,235
Yeah, well, I'm not
gonna do this whole thing

9
00:00:25,259 --> 00:00:27,139
where you're sad about
every case that I have.

10
00:00:27,711 --> 00:00:28,977
I'm not sad.

11
00:00:29,063 --> 00:00:30,983
I'm trying to start
a conversation.

12
00:00:31,731 --> 00:00:32,931
Okay, well...

13
00:00:32,999 --> 00:00:34,999
Make conversation
about something else.

14
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,453
I gotta go.

15
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:43,954
<i>There are distinct differences</i>

16
00:00:43,978 --> 00:00:45,944
<i>between male and female brains.</i>

17
00:00:50,567 --> 00:00:53,318
<i>Female brains have a
larger hippocampus...</i>

18
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:02,189
<i>Which usually makes them
better at retention and memory.</i>

19
00:01:05,066 --> 00:01:07,044
Okay, I get that you like
to put your dirty clothes

20
00:01:07,068 --> 00:01:08,912
in my laundry because,
frankly, if you didn't,

21
00:01:08,936 --> 00:01:10,530
you'd never have
any clean clothes.

22
00:01:10,554 --> 00:01:13,105
Fine. I will wash
your dirty underpants.

23
00:01:13,174 --> 00:01:15,807
But you know what? I
am not okay with washing

24
00:01:15,876 --> 00:01:18,710
your skank of the
week's dirty underpants.

25
00:01:18,779 --> 00:01:21,796
<i>Male brains have a
bigger parietal cortex,</i>

26
00:01:21,865 --> 00:01:24,316
<i>which helps when
fending off an attack.</i>

27
00:01:24,385 --> 00:01:26,901
Actually, those are...
Lexie's. Thank you.

28
00:01:27,505 --> 00:01:28,804
Oh.

29
00:01:28,873 --> 00:01:30,839
She... Oh, yeah.

30
00:01:30,908 --> 00:01:33,241
Okay. Never mind.

31
00:01:37,114 --> 00:01:38,830
Not Lexie's. Nope.

32
00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:41,333
Lauren, third floor, Radiology.

33
00:01:42,002 --> 00:01:43,134
Oh.

34
00:01:43,203 --> 00:01:44,536
Nice.

35
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:46,382
<i>Male brains confront challenges</i>

36
00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:48,218
<i>differently than female brains.</i>

37
00:01:48,242 --> 00:01:50,554
It's three days.
We're gonna be fine.

38
00:01:50,578 --> 00:01:51,843
Bye, Mommies.

39
00:01:51,912 --> 00:01:53,523
Have fun at the
conference, Mommies.

40
00:01:53,547 --> 00:01:55,430
Bye-bye, baby boo.

41
00:01:55,498 --> 00:01:57,465
Go.

42
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:58,550
Just one more kiss.

43
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:00,552
Go. Come on.

44
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,932
I'm gonna miss you so much.

45
00:02:01,956 --> 00:02:03,455
Bye. Bye.

46
00:02:03,524 --> 00:02:04,589
See ya.

47
00:02:04,658 --> 00:02:06,608
Bye.

48
00:02:06,677 --> 00:02:07,904
<i>Women are hardwired to
communicate with language...</i>

49
00:02:07,928 --> 00:02:10,094
It's just you and
me, kid. High five.

50
00:02:10,163 --> 00:02:11,229
<i>Detail...</i>

51
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:12,564
High five.

52
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:14,165
Dap. Blow it up.

53
00:02:15,336 --> 00:02:16,434
<i>Empathy.</i>

54
00:02:17,521 --> 00:02:19,304
<i>Men...</i>

55
00:02:19,373 --> 00:02:21,339
<i>Not so much.</i>

56
00:02:25,896 --> 00:02:29,297
<i>It doesn't mean that we're
any less capable of emotion.</i>

57
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:34,870
<i>We can talk about our feelings.</i>

58
00:02:34,939 --> 00:02:36,721
<i>It's just that...</i>

59
00:02:37,875 --> 00:02:39,140
<i>Most of the time...</i>

60
00:02:45,316 --> 00:02:48,033
<i>We'd really rather not.</i>

61
00:02:56,326 --> 00:02:59,678
Great. I come here to eat
breakfast, and it smells like feet.

62
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,242
What's another
word for "crappy"?

63
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:04,615
Sucky.

64
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:05,900
Suckity. Stankin'.

65
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:07,269
Shut up.

66
00:03:07,338 --> 00:03:09,187
You could go with
assy, also, or ass-like.

67
00:03:09,256 --> 00:03:10,739
You're ass-like.

68
00:03:10,808 --> 00:03:12,874
No, that toe jam on
your feet is ass-like.

69
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:15,227
Honestly...

70
00:03:15,295 --> 00:03:16,861
You ever bathe? No.

71
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:19,475
I've got that damn
Africa paper and boards.

72
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:20,798
Man, fifth year blows.

73
00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:22,762
Oh. Hey.

74
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:24,218
Chief. Sorry.

75
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:25,904
You don't have
to apologize to me.

76
00:03:25,973 --> 00:03:27,784
You're at the top of
the resident food chain.

77
00:03:27,808 --> 00:03:29,140
The world is your oyster.

78
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:30,675
Now, if you want
to waste your time

79
00:03:30,744 --> 00:03:32,204
bitching about it,
that's your business.

80
00:03:32,228 --> 00:03:35,096
Hey, have you heard
anything about anything big

81
00:03:35,165 --> 00:03:38,800
coming in today, like a car
accident or a building collapse?

82
00:03:38,868 --> 00:03:41,420
Chief, are you
trolling for cases?

83
00:03:41,488 --> 00:03:43,433
Dude, don't you have a
laminectomy with Shepherd today?

84
00:03:43,457 --> 00:03:45,151
Yeah, but that's a snoozefest.

85
00:03:45,175 --> 00:03:46,741
No, don't you have it now?

86
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:48,626
Right now.

87
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:49,945
Oh, damn it.

88
00:03:50,013 --> 00:03:52,831
Shepherd is gonna
have my ass. Damn it!

89
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:55,150
Wait. Wait. Just tell him
you had an appointment

90
00:03:55,219 --> 00:03:57,835
with Mayfield in
22 and it ran long.

91
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,371
He'll understand.

92
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,407
Yeah. Okay. Thanks, Chief.

93
00:04:02,476 --> 00:04:04,943
Not the chief. Not the chief.

94
00:04:08,198 --> 00:04:10,209
You started? I'm supposed to
be lead surgeon on this case.

95
00:04:10,233 --> 00:04:11,978
You forfeited the
right to take lead

96
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:13,746
by showing up 20 minutes late.

97
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:15,737
Dr. Warren, when
you were a fifth year,

98
00:04:15,806 --> 00:04:17,422
were you late to surgery?

99
00:04:17,491 --> 00:04:18,657
Are you kidding?

100
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:19,858
He's a professional.

101
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:22,294
And respectful of my OR staff.

102
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:23,422
Of your attendings.

103
00:04:23,446 --> 00:04:24,524
Definitely my attending.

104
00:04:24,548 --> 00:04:26,247
Dr. Grey was never late.

105
00:04:26,316 --> 00:04:29,501
No. She was many things,
but late was not one of them.

106
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:30,880
See, Karev here is
just trying to sock away

107
00:04:30,904 --> 00:04:32,437
as much non-peds
hours as possible.

108
00:04:32,506 --> 00:04:34,787
Oh. Slummin' it in neuro, huh?

109
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:36,841
I'm sorry. I had an appointment

110
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:38,576
with Mayfield in 22.

111
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:40,162
It went a little long.

112
00:04:43,934 --> 00:04:45,895
We didn't... DEREK:
Oh, well, in that case...

113
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:47,202
We didn't realize...

114
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:49,071
Why don't you come
in and finish up, then?

115
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:50,572
Thanks.

116
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:55,310
Can I get a Kerrison Rongeur?

117
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:56,911
Thanks.

118
00:04:58,582 --> 00:04:59,948
Sloan.

119
00:05:00,017 --> 00:05:01,149
Um...

120
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:05,164
Look, I'm putting the word out.

121
00:05:05,188 --> 00:05:07,233
My case load's been
kind of light these days,

122
00:05:07,257 --> 00:05:08,835
so if you hear of any
red meat on the floor...

123
00:05:08,859 --> 00:05:10,124
Look at him,

124
00:05:10,193 --> 00:05:11,827
acting like he runs the place.

125
00:05:12,529 --> 00:05:14,362
Well, he does.

126
00:05:14,431 --> 00:05:17,865
He's hanging on by
his teeth. It's undignified.

127
00:05:17,934 --> 00:05:19,045
What are you guys looking at?

128
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:20,668
Hunt's not cut out for the job.

129
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:21,798
What, did something happen?

130
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:23,471
Nothing happened.

131
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:26,374
You can see it in his demeanor.
He's got fear in his eyes.

132
00:05:26,443 --> 00:05:28,960
He's a decorated
military officer.

133
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:32,597
What do you think got to
him, call schedule, lunch order?

134
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:35,178
I'm just sayin', when he belly
flops, I'm here for the hospital.

135
00:05:35,202 --> 00:05:36,242
You're a good man.

136
00:05:36,286 --> 00:05:38,953
Gentlemen, anything
I can do for you?

137
00:05:39,022 --> 00:05:40,539
Just watching the magic.

138
00:05:40,607 --> 00:05:42,685
Actually, I'm glad I ran into
you. I'm gonna need your OR.

139
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:45,910
We just a call about a big
accident at the convention center.

140
00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:48,246
So I'm gonna have
to bump your brow lift.

141
00:05:50,217 --> 00:05:51,828
Did you say big accident?

142
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:52,867
Watch him.

143
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:54,580
How big is big
exactly? Hard to tell.

144
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:56,049
All I know is, the
paramedics suggested

145
00:05:56,073 --> 00:05:57,750
that we clear as many
beds in the ER as possible.

146
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:59,319
Did they now? Okay,
what else did they say?

147
00:05:59,343 --> 00:06:00,820
Well, to prep the blood bank,

148
00:06:00,844 --> 00:06:01,988
that we're gonna
need a lot of blood.

149
00:06:02,012 --> 00:06:04,112
Blood? Blood? Did
they say anything else?

150
00:06:04,181 --> 00:06:05,658
Not much. It was hard to talk.

151
00:06:05,682 --> 00:06:07,077
There was a lot of
commotion in the background,

152
00:06:07,101 --> 00:06:08,594
you know, some
screaming... Screaming?

153
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:10,551
Yeah, screaming.

154
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,648
You know, I don't think I have
ever triaged in a tie before.

155
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:15,140
Well, just tuck it
in your belt. Okay.

156
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:16,986
I don't know who
Mayfield in 22 is,

157
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:19,488
but that's the first time Shepherd's
been off my back all week.

158
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:20,912
Webber knows things.

159
00:06:20,981 --> 00:06:22,358
The guy is a freakin' genius.

160
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:23,448
Who's a genius?

161
00:06:23,517 --> 00:06:24,761
Nobody. Um, you look nice today.

162
00:06:24,785 --> 00:06:25,962
Have you heard what's coming in?

163
00:06:25,986 --> 00:06:27,802
Human stampede at
a comic convention.

164
00:06:27,871 --> 00:06:28,970
Dr. Hunt.

165
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:31,339
Which means crush
injuries. Lots of them.

166
00:06:31,408 --> 00:06:33,824
I have admin on the phone.
They say it's important.

167
00:06:38,866 --> 00:06:40,360
Okay, I've got an
abdominal crush injury.

168
00:06:40,384 --> 00:06:42,050
I'm available.

169
00:06:42,118 --> 00:06:43,346
Oh, I have it, sir. It's
okay, Grey. I'm don't mind.

170
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:44,864
I have it. It's too
routine for you, sir.

171
00:06:44,888 --> 00:06:47,439
All right, looks like some
lower extremity fractures.

172
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:50,341
I'll take that for you, Chief.

173
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,930
Got another one coming in.

174
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:54,979
Ooh! Dibs on footprint face.

175
00:06:55,048 --> 00:06:57,465
I got an unconscious
sexy zombie nurse.

176
00:06:57,533 --> 00:06:58,566
I'll take it.

177
00:06:58,635 --> 00:07:00,551
Oh, no. No, no.
This one is mine!

178
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:03,771
This is my sexy zombie nurse!

179
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:06,148
You hear that? Okay.

180
00:07:09,813 --> 00:07:11,278
Bend your knee for me.

181
00:07:13,216 --> 00:07:15,750
Good. Now your ankle.

182
00:07:15,819 --> 00:07:18,586
15 collector's edition replicas

183
00:07:18,655 --> 00:07:22,256
of the <i>Doctor Who</i> TARDIS
in original packaging,

184
00:07:22,325 --> 00:07:24,809
signed by Russell T. Davies,

185
00:07:24,878 --> 00:07:26,718
free to the first 15
people through the door,

186
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,513
and I was there,

187
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:30,532
right in the middle of it.

188
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,845
Your other knee. I'm never
in the middle of anything.

189
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:34,269
Ankle.

190
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:37,855
I have battle wounds.

191
00:07:37,924 --> 00:07:39,535
All right. I'm gonna get
you some painkillers,

192
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:41,571
and then we'll get
you up to x-rays.

193
00:07:41,595 --> 00:07:43,328
Oh, God. Okay.

194
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:45,263
Um...

195
00:07:45,332 --> 00:07:46,764
Am I gonna walk again?

196
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:50,401
No.

197
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,637
I'm just messing
with you. You're fine.

198
00:07:52,706 --> 00:07:54,973
Just got a few
broken toes, if that.

199
00:07:55,042 --> 00:07:56,625
Just toes? Yeah.

200
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:58,893
Do I at least get
a cast for that?

201
00:07:58,962 --> 00:08:00,761
Primary survey looks good.

202
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:03,776
Well, this laceration
looks deep.

203
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,878
Let's set up a suture
kit and 4-0 vicryl.

204
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:07,235
Right away, Doctor.

205
00:08:08,838 --> 00:08:10,171
This is, um...

206
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:12,440
Why isn't this bleeding?

207
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:16,093
What is...

208
00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:19,481
It's fake.

209
00:08:19,549 --> 00:08:21,115
The damn thing is fake.

210
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:27,589
Ah. Never mind. Moving on
to the laceration on her clavicle.

211
00:08:32,162 --> 00:08:34,045
You gotta be kidding me.

212
00:08:36,717 --> 00:08:39,384
Look, is there any
real blood here at all?

213
00:08:40,053 --> 00:08:41,068
Huh?

214
00:08:41,138 --> 00:08:42,570
It was crazy.

215
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:44,683
500 people trying to fit
through this one little door.

216
00:08:44,707 --> 00:08:47,808
Hell, that kid in the Borg
costume tripped me on purpose.

217
00:08:47,877 --> 00:08:49,589
They just kept
coming and coming,

218
00:08:49,613 --> 00:08:53,047
like they didn't even realize they
were running over a human being.

219
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:54,427
All right, guys, we
got neck tenderness,

220
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:55,828
so we want to
be careful on this.

221
00:08:55,852 --> 00:08:58,219
One, two, three.

222
00:08:58,288 --> 00:08:59,798
The worst part was
when Keith's head

223
00:08:59,822 --> 00:09:01,467
got caught on this one
guy's costume and...

224
00:09:01,491 --> 00:09:03,775
And it ripped off his ear?

225
00:09:03,844 --> 00:09:05,326
That's bad, isn't it?

226
00:09:05,395 --> 00:09:06,989
How did nobody mention
that your ear is ripped off?

227
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:08,624
Well, we looked around
on the floor for a while,

228
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:10,743
but it's probably, like, stuck
to some Stormtrooper's boot.

229
00:09:10,767 --> 00:09:12,528
Well, at least we
got what we came for.

230
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,218
We got a TARDIS.

231
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:16,688
Well...

232
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:19,023
I got a TARDIS.

233
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,083
You broke seven
toes, but really five,

234
00:09:34,107 --> 00:09:35,701
'cause pinkie toes barely count.

235
00:09:35,725 --> 00:09:38,221
So we're just gonna tape
'em up and get you outta here.

236
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:42,414
Tape? I survive a human
stampede, and all I get is tape?

237
00:09:42,482 --> 00:09:43,782
I'll throw in some crutches.

238
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:46,090
You don't look like
you've got great balance.

239
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:48,731
What are you
supposed to be anyway?

240
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:49,854
I'm a hobbit.

241
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:52,290
We're a gentle folk

242
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:54,476
from a farming
community called the Shire.

243
00:09:54,544 --> 00:09:56,384
It's in the northwest
corner of Middle-earth.

244
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:02,216
We live a simple life,
but we crave adventure.

245
00:10:02,285 --> 00:10:05,719
And when we find it,
some become heroes.

246
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:10,291
The Dothraki princess.

247
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,800
Yeah. I stopped caring
about 10 minutes ago.

248
00:10:12,828 --> 00:10:14,606
No. That... That doctor
over there looks just like

249
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:17,982
the Dothraki princess from the
legendary <i>Song of Ice and Fire</i> series.

250
00:10:18,051 --> 00:10:20,051
Not her hair, but her skin

251
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,635
and her eyes, and...

252
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:23,604
Oh, oh, God. Oh,
God. Here she comes.

253
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:29,394
Her?

254
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,173
You have nerd chub for Kepner?

255
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:32,530
Kepner.

256
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:36,167
Karev, trauma room, now.

257
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,153
Kepner.

258
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:41,689
Give me my TARDIS!

259
00:10:41,758 --> 00:10:43,452
It's not yours! I fought for it!

260
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:44,596
I lost an ear for it!

261
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,361
Karev. Please.

262
00:10:46,429 --> 00:10:48,140
No, he's stealing
my TARDIS! Let's go.

263
00:10:48,164 --> 00:10:49,475
Just stop him. Mr. Hitchens,

264
00:10:49,499 --> 00:10:51,510
your ear has lost all
of its soft tissue, but...

265
00:10:51,534 --> 00:10:53,868
We'll be able to construct
an entirely new ear.

266
00:10:53,937 --> 00:10:55,781
We'll take cartilage from
your ribs and match it

267
00:10:55,805 --> 00:10:58,072
to the exact size and
shape of your existing ear.

268
00:10:58,141 --> 00:11:00,174
It's a long process,

269
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:02,243
but when we're finished,
that ear will look good.

270
00:11:03,613 --> 00:11:05,129
Anything you want to add, Avery?

271
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:07,899
No. You covered it.

272
00:11:07,951 --> 00:11:09,984
Mr. Hitchens,

273
00:11:10,053 --> 00:11:11,447
what are you feeling right now?

274
00:11:11,471 --> 00:11:12,503
Hurt, betrayed.

275
00:11:12,572 --> 00:11:13,904
Anything in your legs?

276
00:11:15,292 --> 00:11:17,191
No. Nothing.

277
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,288
All right. He needs an
MRI right away, okay?

278
00:11:24,367 --> 00:11:26,212
You paged. What's going on?

279
00:11:26,236 --> 00:11:28,731
Dr. Warren's resident punctured the
dura of your patient from this morning

280
00:11:28,755 --> 00:11:30,416
during what should have
been a routine epidural.

281
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,001
Okay, first of all,
there's no such thing

282
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:33,852
as anything routine after
a patient's had surgery.

283
00:11:33,876 --> 00:11:36,027
And you have no right
to yell at my resident.

284
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:38,074
There was spinal
fluid all over her bed.

285
00:11:38,098 --> 00:11:39,280
How is the patient?

286
00:11:39,349 --> 00:11:41,094
Just checked on her.
She's stable and pain free.

287
00:11:41,118 --> 00:11:42,662
Your resident was
sloppy and rushed.

288
00:11:42,686 --> 00:11:44,080
You have no idea how
difficult epidurals can be.

289
00:11:44,104 --> 00:11:45,965
Because I'm a nurse?
Watch your tone with me.

290
00:11:45,989 --> 00:11:47,667
Or what? What are you gonna do?

291
00:11:47,691 --> 00:11:49,507
Okay, okay, done. Break it up.

292
00:11:49,576 --> 00:11:51,692
Walk away. We're done.

293
00:11:51,761 --> 00:11:56,063
Walk away. Walk away.

294
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:57,610
I get why you're mad at the guy,

295
00:11:57,634 --> 00:11:58,894
but if you're gonna
have a fight about Bailey,

296
00:11:58,918 --> 00:12:00,095
do it on your own time.

297
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:01,436
Fight about Bailey?

298
00:12:02,672 --> 00:12:04,205
Wait. No.

299
00:12:04,274 --> 00:12:05,651
No, Bailey... Bailey's with him?

300
00:12:05,675 --> 00:12:06,807
I should go.

301
00:12:06,876 --> 00:12:08,710
Like they went to
dinner once or twice or...

302
00:12:08,778 --> 00:12:10,739
You really don't want
to know. Shepherd.

303
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:12,341
Like don't go into
the conference room

304
00:12:12,365 --> 00:12:13,593
on eight or nine
without knocking.

305
00:12:13,617 --> 00:12:15,282
Oh, come on. You asked.

306
00:12:16,052 --> 00:12:17,284
Does she talk about him?

307
00:12:17,354 --> 00:12:20,388
Yeah, she said his hands
have a kind of tenderness,

308
00:12:20,456 --> 00:12:21,801
uh, some kind of
magic. You're an ass.

309
00:12:21,825 --> 00:12:22,985
Don't yell at my
nurses, even the men.

310
00:12:23,009 --> 00:12:25,493
Sure. Just drop a
bomb and walk away.

311
00:12:25,562 --> 00:12:26,760
Walk away!

312
00:12:28,098 --> 00:12:30,097
Okay, what's next? Sign these.

313
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,399
And these.

314
00:12:31,468 --> 00:12:33,551
And this needs to be
in by this afternoon.

315
00:12:33,619 --> 00:12:35,631
Well, I will look at that
right now. Thank you.

316
00:12:35,655 --> 00:12:37,004
Sure.

317
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:40,875
All right.

318
00:12:44,547 --> 00:12:46,180
Coming through!

319
00:12:53,956 --> 00:12:55,635
<i>Code blue in 32-12.</i>

320
00:12:55,659 --> 00:12:57,108
<i>Code blue, 32-12.</i>

321
00:13:02,998 --> 00:13:05,266
Hey, Avery, check this out.

322
00:13:05,335 --> 00:13:06,634
Damn.

323
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:08,319
C-6 is totally shattered.

324
00:13:08,387 --> 00:13:09,753
I know.

325
00:13:16,479 --> 00:13:17,723
I used to eat my
lunch here, too.

326
00:13:17,747 --> 00:13:19,113
Yeah.

327
00:13:19,182 --> 00:13:21,349
Helps break up the day
and gets you outta the office

328
00:13:21,417 --> 00:13:23,701
and let's you feel like
you're still in the action.

329
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:25,086
Yeah.

330
00:13:25,155 --> 00:13:27,032
Is there something
you might need me for?

331
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:28,405
Oh, oh, no, no.

332
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:30,959
I'm just cutting through
on my way to the skills lab.

333
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:35,613
Um...

334
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:36,997
Actually, um...

335
00:13:37,884 --> 00:13:39,004
You gonna eat those grapes?

336
00:13:44,191 --> 00:13:45,231
How are the scans?

337
00:13:45,292 --> 00:13:47,003
He's got a burst fracture of C-6

338
00:13:47,027 --> 00:13:49,593
so we need to do
discectomies above and below.

339
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:52,408
I thought I'd put in a
fibular graft and a plate.

340
00:13:52,432 --> 00:13:54,031
Sounds like a good plan.

341
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,278
You think since I'm
operating in two places,

342
00:13:56,302 --> 00:13:58,662
that this could count
as two neurosurgeries?

343
00:14:00,073 --> 00:14:02,707
Because you need to log
more non-peds surgeries?

344
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:04,252
Yeah. That's your question?

345
00:14:04,276 --> 00:14:05,588
Young man's spine is pulverized.

346
00:14:05,612 --> 00:14:06,806
You blink once, he
may never walk again.

347
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:08,157
You don't want to talk
to me about the surgery?

348
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:09,842
You want to ask to see if
you can get two gold stars

349
00:14:09,866 --> 00:14:11,582
instead of one? No, I...

350
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:13,434
Just get outta here.
You're off my service.

351
00:14:14,003 --> 00:14:15,186
Go.

352
00:14:18,058 --> 00:14:19,568
Shepherd just
kicked me off neuro

353
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:21,952
'cause I don't piss myself
every time I look at a spine.

354
00:14:21,977 --> 00:14:23,961
The guy is a douche.

355
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:26,430
His wife was his resident,
and now he's got you.

356
00:14:26,499 --> 00:14:28,148
Tough act to follow.

357
00:14:28,217 --> 00:14:30,062
Sorry, Chief. I'm not the chief.

358
00:14:30,086 --> 00:14:32,246
We're practicing
microsurgery techniques.

359
00:14:32,689 --> 00:14:33,737
Not for snacking.

360
00:14:36,158 --> 00:14:37,386
You know, you two
need to find a way

361
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:39,076
to start feeling the joy again.

362
00:14:39,145 --> 00:14:40,511
I mean, there's
gonna come a time

363
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,658
when you're gonna be wishing
you were a fifth year again

364
00:14:42,682 --> 00:14:46,150
just to get back in the OR
and get your hands dirty.

365
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:47,618
You'll operate
on a grape just so

366
00:14:47,687 --> 00:14:49,036
you'll keep from getting rusty.

367
00:14:49,104 --> 00:14:51,289
You're in the OR all the time.

368
00:14:51,358 --> 00:14:52,790
To supervise, sure.

369
00:14:52,842 --> 00:14:56,076
They'll bring me in on a
really complicated part.

370
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:59,297
But I never open, I never close.

371
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:01,460
Is this a technique I could
use on an ear reconstruction?

372
00:15:01,484 --> 00:15:02,850
Yeah, now you see there?

373
00:15:02,918 --> 00:15:05,303
Avery's starting
to feel the joy.

374
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:06,404
Pull up a grape.

375
00:15:06,473 --> 00:15:07,713
Yes. Please.

376
00:15:07,741 --> 00:15:08,984
Sloan won't let him
touch an instrument.

377
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:10,269
He barely lets him
finish a sentence.

378
00:15:10,293 --> 00:15:11,904
At least he lets me in the OR.

379
00:15:13,179 --> 00:15:15,697
Can I get you a grape?

380
00:15:15,765 --> 00:15:17,710
Thanks, but Robbins says
she's kicking me to the curb

381
00:15:17,734 --> 00:15:19,183
if I don't publish.

382
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:21,618
I gotta do my damn Africa paper.

383
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:22,853
Ugh!

384
00:15:26,725 --> 00:15:27,953
He's not feeling the joy.

385
00:15:27,977 --> 00:15:29,076
Nope.

386
00:15:30,446 --> 00:15:32,086
Now you see this,
how I'm doing it here?

387
00:15:34,717 --> 00:15:36,617
Wow. That bad, huh?

388
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:38,314
I'm completely
buried in paperwork.

389
00:15:38,338 --> 00:15:40,015
I'm chained to this damned desk.

390
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:41,906
Finish your drink.
Let's get outta here.

391
00:15:41,974 --> 00:15:44,014
And go where?
Just finish your drink.

392
00:15:51,834 --> 00:15:53,612
I don't understand. Your
contractor doesn't care

393
00:15:53,636 --> 00:15:55,598
that you're building
this deck yourself?

394
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:57,905
Well, I wouldn't say that,
but he does work for me.

395
00:15:57,974 --> 00:16:01,108
If I didn't have this,
I'd kill my resident.

396
00:16:01,177 --> 00:16:02,242
Karev?

397
00:16:02,311 --> 00:16:04,344
Ah, he's just not interested.

398
00:16:04,413 --> 00:16:07,615
The vertebral column
was wide open,

399
00:16:07,684 --> 00:16:10,817
perfect view of the cord... It's
beautiful. He just could care less.

400
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:12,753
He's just punching a time clock.

401
00:16:12,821 --> 00:16:14,054
He's not Meredith.

402
00:16:14,123 --> 00:16:15,556
No, he's not.

403
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:19,322
You know, when
you quit as Chief,

404
00:16:19,346 --> 00:16:21,457
I thought you were
out of your mind.

405
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:22,813
Now not so much?

406
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,894
Is it me or is everyone
in the hospital

407
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:27,496
just waiting for me
to fall on my face?

408
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,800
Oh, no. We all got money on it.

409
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:32,168
I got you down for $100 that
you make it at least six months,

410
00:16:32,192 --> 00:16:33,291
so buck up.

411
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:39,108
I've been walking on
eggshells at home for weeks.

412
00:16:39,132 --> 00:16:42,066
I used to come to work
to let off steam, and now...

413
00:16:42,134 --> 00:16:44,294
That's become a nightmare, too.

414
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,114
<i>And then Dada used</i>

415
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:59,116
5-0 monocryl inside
the big man's nose,

416
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:00,951
and poof!

417
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,821
Like magic, there
was no scar at all.

418
00:17:05,325 --> 00:17:07,825
We're fine, just like
we were 20 minutes ago

419
00:17:07,894 --> 00:17:10,010
and 20 minutes before that.

420
00:17:12,849 --> 00:17:14,982
Are you gonna keep
this up all three days?

421
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:16,917
Because it got old hours ago.

422
00:17:17,687 --> 00:17:18,770
Oh, God.

423
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:26,037
<i>Mark? Mark?</i>

424
00:17:26,061 --> 00:17:28,228
<i>Are you there?</i>

425
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:30,497
Guess who just rolled
over for the first time.

426
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:45,212
Karev!

427
00:17:45,281 --> 00:17:46,592
Hunt told me I
could take his chair.

428
00:17:46,616 --> 00:17:48,110
Sofia rolled off
the sofa last night,

429
00:17:48,134 --> 00:17:49,628
and she hasn't cried
since. Something's wrong.

430
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:51,252
Yeah, I'm not a
pediatrician. Sorry.

431
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:54,388
If I tell anyone in peds,
they'll call Arizona.

432
00:17:54,457 --> 00:17:55,989
Yeah, I got a paper to write.

433
00:17:56,058 --> 00:17:57,819
You drop what
you're doing right now

434
00:17:57,843 --> 00:17:59,883
by the time I count to
three, or I will end you.

435
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:03,831
One, two...

436
00:18:10,373 --> 00:18:12,473
All right, the residents'
lounge needs a new couch.

437
00:18:12,542 --> 00:18:13,708
Make sure that gets there.

438
00:18:13,776 --> 00:18:15,326
And let's see if
the nurses' station

439
00:18:15,394 --> 00:18:16,994
on the third floor
could use this desk.

440
00:18:17,063 --> 00:18:19,413
Okay. Thank you.

441
00:18:19,482 --> 00:18:22,182
I know. I know what
you're thinking, and no,

442
00:18:22,251 --> 00:18:24,819
as much as you might want
me to, I am not resigning.

443
00:18:24,888 --> 00:18:26,787
I'm just getting
rid of a few things

444
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:29,173
that I don't feel I
need to be Chief.

445
00:18:29,241 --> 00:18:31,620
And you can say what you want
about how I'm gonna need my office

446
00:18:31,644 --> 00:18:33,194
or need my desk.

447
00:18:33,262 --> 00:18:36,747
I say you're wrong. I say my
office can be wherever I am. Okay?

448
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:47,536
The procedure went well,

449
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,070
but your spine
is still very fragile.

450
00:18:49,094 --> 00:18:50,840
Good news. We found the ear.

451
00:18:50,864 --> 00:18:51,979
I found it.

452
00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:53,968
I went back to the
convention center,

453
00:18:53,999 --> 00:18:57,039
stayed there all night, looking
through dumpsters and trash.

454
00:18:57,103 --> 00:18:58,486
But guess where it was.

455
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:01,383
The lost and found, hooked
on to some crazy helmet.

456
00:19:01,407 --> 00:19:03,374
Where's my TARDIS?

457
00:19:03,443 --> 00:19:04,675
Okay.

458
00:19:04,744 --> 00:19:08,312
How about a, "Thank you,
Greg, for finding my ear

459
00:19:09,015 --> 00:19:10,247
"in the trash"?

460
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:12,210
I don't care about my ear.
I care about the TARDIS.

461
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:13,612
We care about the ear, Keith.

462
00:19:13,636 --> 00:19:16,153
Keith, try not to move, okay?

463
00:19:16,222 --> 00:19:17,604
Fine.

464
00:19:17,673 --> 00:19:19,573
Can you at least...

465
00:19:19,642 --> 00:19:21,562
Keep it in the living
room so I can look at it?

466
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,328
Actually...

467
00:19:25,398 --> 00:19:27,564
Oh, my God. You
sold it, didn't you?

468
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:29,216
You sold it? No!

469
00:19:30,402 --> 00:19:31,568
I'll stabilize his neck.

470
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:32,814
All right, move
your fingers for me.

471
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:33,871
Your toes.

472
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:35,017
Is he okay? Move your toes.

473
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:36,252
Is he okay? I don't know.

474
00:19:36,276 --> 00:19:38,203
His lower extremities
just went limp.

475
00:19:38,227 --> 00:19:40,467
Keith, try and move
your feet for me, please.

476
00:19:40,663 --> 00:19:41,912
Now wiggle your toes.

477
00:19:45,785 --> 00:19:48,118
She's usually a lot
more alert than this.

478
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,553
I sat up with her all night,

479
00:19:49,622 --> 00:19:51,705
checking to make sure
she was still breathing.

480
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:53,184
Maybe the reason she's not alert

481
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:54,519
is because you
kept her up all night.

482
00:19:54,543 --> 00:19:56,276
What's that?

483
00:19:56,345 --> 00:19:57,473
Right there. See that?

484
00:19:57,497 --> 00:19:59,630
Yeah. It's a perfectly
healthy brain

485
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:01,014
of a perfectly healthy baby

486
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,733
who didn't need a CT scan.

487
00:20:04,737 --> 00:20:06,437
The baby's fine. I'm going now.

488
00:20:09,892 --> 00:20:12,325
Yeah, there's the tiger.

489
00:20:12,394 --> 00:20:13,910
Ooh! There's the tiger.

490
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:15,591
The guy threw a
beer bottle at me.

491
00:20:15,615 --> 00:20:17,781
Who throws bottles
at people's heads?

492
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:20,884
Carter? Why are you back?

493
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:22,331
The nurse says you
think I missed something.

494
00:20:22,355 --> 00:20:23,554
Get off me!

495
00:20:23,623 --> 00:20:26,039
You stupid kids with
your idiot convention!

496
00:20:26,108 --> 00:20:27,868
Every year, you
line up on my lawn,

497
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:29,326
block my driveway.

498
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:31,345
It's my property, got it?

499
00:20:31,414 --> 00:20:32,491
Sir! Sir! I'm gonna
have you arrested!

500
00:20:32,515 --> 00:20:33,930
You threw a bottle at me!

501
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:36,278
Sir, get back in the
gurney right now!

502
00:20:36,302 --> 00:20:38,514
I need you back in
the gurney. Thank you.

503
00:20:38,538 --> 00:20:40,104
Bed six, please.

504
00:20:46,779 --> 00:20:48,746
You're here to see Kepner again.

505
00:20:48,814 --> 00:20:51,765
No. I'm here for
an exam. I feel sick.

506
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:53,879
Look, why don't I give her
your number, you get outta here,

507
00:20:53,903 --> 00:20:56,003
you give her a call,
get your geek on?

508
00:20:56,072 --> 00:20:57,571
Oh, no. I could never...

509
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,201
No, trust me. You two have
more in common than you think.

510
00:20:59,225 --> 00:21:00,986
Couldn't you just admit
me as a patient for the day?

511
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:02,108
It's not gonna happen.

512
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:04,289
But what if my foot
was hurting, or my leg?

513
00:21:04,313 --> 00:21:06,391
I'm not giving up a bed for a
stalker with fake symptoms.

514
00:21:06,415 --> 00:21:08,582
Forget it. I have chest pains,

515
00:21:08,651 --> 00:21:10,762
which means you have to admit me

516
00:21:10,786 --> 00:21:12,920
and keep me for
observation, right?

517
00:21:19,312 --> 00:21:22,613
Keith reinjured his spine,
creating an epidural bleed

518
00:21:22,682 --> 00:21:24,748
that needs to be addressed
as soon as possible.

519
00:21:24,817 --> 00:21:26,462
- So does the ear.
- His ear is cosmetic.

520
00:21:26,486 --> 00:21:27,846
The bleed could
leave him paralyzed.

521
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:30,087
The ear's been detached
for over 20 hours.

522
00:21:30,156 --> 00:21:32,706
If we don't reattach it
soon, it won't be viable at all.

523
00:21:32,775 --> 00:21:34,920
Are you going in through the
front of the neck to get to the spine?

524
00:21:34,944 --> 00:21:36,059
Yes.

525
00:21:36,129 --> 00:21:37,406
So the patient will be
on his back already.

526
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:38,507
Mmm-hmm.

527
00:21:38,531 --> 00:21:40,964
Why don't we insert the
ear into the abdomen?

528
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:42,511
Keep it viable with
the blood supply there,

529
00:21:42,535 --> 00:21:44,468
let you operate on the spine.

530
00:21:44,537 --> 00:21:47,004
Take it out
tomorrow, reattach it.

531
00:21:47,072 --> 00:21:49,307
Good idea. Really good idea.

532
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:50,557
Shep, you need me?

533
00:21:50,626 --> 00:21:52,026
Oh, yes.

534
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:59,719
So I just swung by your
office, and you weren't there.

535
00:21:59,769 --> 00:22:01,229
Neither was any
of your furniture.

536
00:22:01,253 --> 00:22:03,370
My office is where I am.

537
00:22:03,439 --> 00:22:05,284
You're really taking this "not
being chained behind your desk"

538
00:22:05,308 --> 00:22:06,690
thing seriously.

539
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:07,902
You find a new resident yet?

540
00:22:07,926 --> 00:22:09,070
I might have a candidate.

541
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:10,339
By the way, my
contractor called.

542
00:22:10,363 --> 00:22:11,607
The lumber for the deck is in.

543
00:22:11,631 --> 00:22:13,564
I'm there. I get the power saw.

544
00:22:16,219 --> 00:22:17,568
Ow!

545
00:22:17,637 --> 00:22:19,553
Yeah, that's what
real pain feels like.

546
00:22:19,621 --> 00:22:21,872
You think she's okay
over there with that guy?

547
00:22:21,941 --> 00:22:23,007
She's fine.

548
00:22:23,075 --> 00:22:24,186
Get off of me!

549
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:25,426
Sir, if you do not calm down,

550
00:22:25,494 --> 00:22:27,072
we will have to
restrain you. Are you...

551
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:28,162
I'm leaving.

552
00:22:28,231 --> 00:22:29,471
Are you sure she's okay?

553
00:22:29,498 --> 00:22:30,798
Now! Ah!

554
00:22:30,866 --> 00:22:31,999
Call security!

555
00:22:32,068 --> 00:22:33,718
Sir. Sir. What the hell?

556
00:22:33,786 --> 00:22:36,498
I have to protect my house!
Oh, God. He's hulking out.

557
00:22:36,522 --> 00:22:37,604
Security!

558
00:22:37,673 --> 00:22:39,857
Give me 5 of haloperidol IM.

559
00:22:39,925 --> 00:22:41,492
I have to protect my house!

560
00:22:41,561 --> 00:22:42,776
Can we get some help?

561
00:22:42,845 --> 00:22:44,428
Hey. Hey. Get off me!

562
00:22:44,497 --> 00:22:45,562
Get outta my way!

563
00:22:45,631 --> 00:22:46,980
I said no!

564
00:22:47,049 --> 00:22:48,610
Somebody, they need
some help over there.

565
00:22:48,634 --> 00:22:50,279
Get off of me! ALEX:
You've gotta hold him still!

566
00:22:50,303 --> 00:22:51,451
I'm trying!

567
00:22:54,073 --> 00:22:56,907
We are a gentle folk
who crave adventure.

568
00:22:58,511 --> 00:23:01,495
We are a gentle folk
who crave adventure.

569
00:23:01,564 --> 00:23:03,547
When we find it, we become...

570
00:23:05,034 --> 00:23:06,066
Heroes.

571
00:23:06,135 --> 00:23:07,201
I can't be here!

572
00:23:07,269 --> 00:23:08,269
Someone stop him!

573
00:23:09,205 --> 00:23:10,671
Excuse me, sir.

574
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:14,224
You need to calm down
right now and stop...

575
00:23:14,293 --> 00:23:15,359
Screw you!

576
00:23:18,097 --> 00:23:19,708
- Where is he?
- Around the corner.

577
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:21,743
Book OR two for a possible
concussion and a broken jaw.

578
00:23:21,767 --> 00:23:23,144
We have a patient
with a broken jaw?

579
00:23:23,168 --> 00:23:24,579
We're about to. I'm on it.

580
00:23:24,603 --> 00:23:26,186
Hey.

581
00:23:38,216 --> 00:23:39,394
Is it true, did you punch a guy?

582
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:40,651
Shep, I need a neuro consult.

583
00:23:40,719 --> 00:23:41,963
Why, because you punched a guy?

584
00:23:41,987 --> 00:23:43,920
What's this I hear about
you punching a guy?

585
00:23:43,989 --> 00:23:45,856
All right, yes, I
punched a patient

586
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:47,869
who was endangering
the safety of my nurses,

587
00:23:47,893 --> 00:23:49,893
my residents,
and other patients.

588
00:23:49,962 --> 00:23:52,362
You know you're the
Chief not the sheriff, right?

589
00:23:52,532 --> 00:23:53,697
The scan is clear.

590
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:55,460
Thank you, all of you, really.

591
00:23:58,571 --> 00:23:59,571
All right.

592
00:24:00,372 --> 00:24:01,571
Yeah, somebody paged me?

593
00:24:01,641 --> 00:24:02,881
This is Carter.

594
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:04,519
He just got into a fight
with a guy twice his size.

595
00:24:04,543 --> 00:24:06,021
There's a lot of blood
in the peritoneal cavity

596
00:24:06,045 --> 00:24:07,544
and a splenic laceration.

597
00:24:07,613 --> 00:24:09,479
Well, this could
take a while to fix.

598
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:11,226
Well, you said you wanted
to get your hands dirty, so...

599
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:13,350
Yeah. Okay, now where
do you think you're going?

600
00:24:13,419 --> 00:24:14,562
Oh, I don't need trauma hours.

601
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:16,564
I need neuro hours
and to finish my paper.

602
00:24:16,588 --> 00:24:18,022
No, you're not going anywhere.

603
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:20,624
Boki, you still have
my playlist on rotation?

604
00:24:20,693 --> 00:24:22,876
Well, crank it up.

605
00:24:44,884 --> 00:24:46,995
I had a meeting in the
conference room on nine.

606
00:24:47,019 --> 00:24:49,019
Great deal of
difficulty concentrating.

607
00:24:49,054 --> 00:24:50,470
You asked.

608
00:24:50,539 --> 00:24:51,916
Yeah, but you knew I
didn't really want to know

609
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:54,692
and you told me anyway,
because you enjoy my pain.

610
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,572
Well, next time, you won't ask.

611
00:24:56,596 --> 00:24:58,540
You have a reputation
for being a nice person.

612
00:24:58,564 --> 00:25:00,114
I think it's a load of crap.

613
00:25:00,182 --> 00:25:01,677
You know what?
I'm building a deck.

614
00:25:01,701 --> 00:25:03,950
Why don't you come by
tonight, take it out on the deck?

615
00:25:04,036 --> 00:25:05,981
That work for
you, hitting things?

616
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:07,404
Doesn't hurt.

617
00:25:07,473 --> 00:25:09,451
You know, before you
insert that ear, Avery,

618
00:25:09,475 --> 00:25:10,919
why don't you move
over and let me show you

619
00:25:10,943 --> 00:25:13,310
that trick for creating a
subcutaneous pocket?

620
00:25:13,379 --> 00:25:15,674
You showed me
that last week, twice.

621
00:25:15,698 --> 00:25:17,164
And now I'm gonna
show you again.

622
00:25:18,768 --> 00:25:20,311
Where's your resident, anyway?

623
00:25:20,335 --> 00:25:23,375
Don't tell me he's late for
an epidural decompression.

624
00:25:24,706 --> 00:25:25,939
Avery.

625
00:25:26,008 --> 00:25:28,442
Ever decompress a
spinal hematoma before?

626
00:25:28,511 --> 00:25:29,954
I've seen one on a video, yeah.

627
00:25:29,978 --> 00:25:31,595
Great. Do this one.

628
00:25:31,664 --> 00:25:33,241
What? MARK: What?

629
00:25:33,265 --> 00:25:34,625
I'm right here if you need me.

630
00:25:34,649 --> 00:25:36,716
Start with the Leksell,

631
00:25:36,786 --> 00:25:39,102
work your way down
through the bone to the dura.

632
00:25:39,171 --> 00:25:40,604
Okay. Okay?

633
00:25:42,441 --> 00:25:44,452
Hard for you to see
what I'm doing, Avery,

634
00:25:44,476 --> 00:25:46,326
from all the way over there.

635
00:25:46,395 --> 00:25:49,515
Well, I figured you could spare
him, since his hands are free.

636
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,794
Excellent control with
the epidural vein, Avery.

637
00:25:52,818 --> 00:25:55,485
I'm surprised you
never considered neuro.

638
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:03,978
I was hoping you'd consider

639
00:26:04,046 --> 00:26:06,697
letting me create the
pocket myself next time.

640
00:26:06,765 --> 00:26:08,443
Shepherd let you
touch a vertebra,

641
00:26:08,467 --> 00:26:10,344
now you're ready to
rebuild a face by yourself?

642
00:26:10,368 --> 00:26:11,885
No.

643
00:26:11,954 --> 00:26:14,972
I just want a chance to try
to practice your surgical trick

644
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,673
on something other than fruit.

645
00:26:16,742 --> 00:26:19,304
You're not ready. That's
why you're working on fruit.

646
00:26:19,328 --> 00:26:22,648
When you're done maiming
fruit, we'll talk about it.

647
00:26:24,667 --> 00:26:26,933
Everything okay?

648
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:28,118
This may be out of line,

649
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:29,703
but is there any
way I can come over

650
00:26:29,772 --> 00:26:31,872
to your place and
hammer something?

651
00:26:31,958 --> 00:26:34,158
I like your initiative, Avery.

652
00:26:36,245 --> 00:26:38,356
So the wiseass
from legal tells me

653
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:40,475
I need to apologize to the drunk

654
00:26:40,499 --> 00:26:42,382
who tore up my ER.

655
00:26:42,451 --> 00:26:45,386
She wasn't ready for a
relationship, and now she's in one.

656
00:26:45,454 --> 00:26:46,865
Right. So where is
the accountability?

657
00:26:46,889 --> 00:26:48,409
That's what I want
to know. What the...

658
00:26:52,127 --> 00:26:53,767
You guys always get
worked up like this?

659
00:26:54,981 --> 00:26:56,246
You should give it a try.

660
00:26:56,315 --> 00:26:57,414
No. I'm good.

661
00:26:57,483 --> 00:26:59,282
Just hammering.

662
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:01,318
Okay.

663
00:27:04,206 --> 00:27:06,607
Thanks for this, by the
way. I know Sloan's my boss,

664
00:27:06,675 --> 00:27:08,715
and he's your friend. I
wouldn't want to overstep.

665
00:27:10,746 --> 00:27:13,213
Not that I ever get a
chance to overstep with him.

666
00:27:14,783 --> 00:27:16,383
Since he has me
on training wheels,

667
00:27:16,452 --> 00:27:19,569
which is fine most
days, except...

668
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:21,182
When I get home, and it
turns out that my girlfriend,

669
00:27:21,206 --> 00:27:23,373
who is a fourth year, has
done more surgery than me.

670
00:27:23,441 --> 00:27:24,874
Then she asks me
how my day went,

671
00:27:24,943 --> 00:27:26,760
and the answer is,
"Great, sweetheart.

672
00:27:26,828 --> 00:27:28,373
"I just spent the last nine
hours standing around

673
00:27:28,397 --> 00:27:29,629
"watching your ex operate."

674
00:27:33,785 --> 00:27:35,152
Yeah.

675
00:27:40,392 --> 00:27:43,472
I know you feel you have
somewhere better to be right now,

676
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:45,429
but you don't.

677
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:47,780
I just want to
finish my paper, sir.

678
00:27:49,034 --> 00:27:51,068
It all falls away...

679
00:27:51,137 --> 00:27:53,853
The research, the
tests, the papers.

680
00:27:53,923 --> 00:27:55,973
We do it to get to this.

681
00:27:56,042 --> 00:27:57,307
Uh-huh.

682
00:27:57,376 --> 00:27:58,959
Adele does that.

683
00:27:59,028 --> 00:28:00,109
What?

684
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:02,513
She "uh-huhs" me.

685
00:28:02,581 --> 00:28:04,982
Every night when I
fill her in on my day,

686
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:08,052
she nods and gives
me a lot of "uh-huhs."

687
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,898
But I can tell that
she's uncomfortable

688
00:28:09,922 --> 00:28:13,101
because half the time, she
can't remember where I work.

689
00:28:13,125 --> 00:28:16,459
And it makes her nervous when
I say I'm cutting people open.

690
00:28:18,764 --> 00:28:20,158
Sometimes you
can't see the joyful

691
00:28:20,182 --> 00:28:22,222
part of your life
until it's over.

692
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:26,219
This is it, Karev.

693
00:28:26,989 --> 00:28:29,055
It's right now.

694
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:31,425
You're in it.

695
00:28:32,828 --> 00:28:34,360
He's bottoming out.

696
00:28:34,429 --> 00:28:36,508
Grab the hilum and hold
pressure so I can get a better look.

697
00:28:36,532 --> 00:28:37,864
Okay, I'm on it.

698
00:28:39,768 --> 00:28:40,768
All right.

699
00:28:40,836 --> 00:28:43,002
Trying to ligate
the artery and...

700
00:28:43,071 --> 00:28:46,039
Damn it! It's retracting.
Come on, Carter.

701
00:28:46,108 --> 00:28:47,624
Come on!

702
00:28:49,862 --> 00:28:50,922
Let's see if that'll hold.

703
00:28:50,946 --> 00:28:52,045
Ready.

704
00:28:57,352 --> 00:28:59,403
Vitals stabilized.

705
00:29:00,823 --> 00:29:02,172
Feeling the joy yet?

706
00:29:02,241 --> 00:29:03,573
I'm feeling it, sir.

707
00:29:03,642 --> 00:29:04,858
Okay.

708
00:29:14,253 --> 00:29:16,064
Hey. I'm heading up to the lab.

709
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:17,699
Webber's gonna show
me his signature stitch.

710
00:29:17,723 --> 00:29:19,656
You want to come? Crap.

711
00:29:19,725 --> 00:29:21,436
I'm supposed to help Bailey
and April with a skills lab

712
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:23,026
for the first years right now.

713
00:29:23,095 --> 00:29:24,844
Grow a pair, bitch boy.

714
00:29:26,582 --> 00:29:27,822
Hey, come on, Avery. Let's go.

715
00:29:29,534 --> 00:29:33,019
Actually, I forgot, I
have an appointment.

716
00:29:33,088 --> 00:29:34,338
So...

717
00:29:34,406 --> 00:29:36,635
An appointment? What
appointment? Hmm?

718
00:29:36,659 --> 00:29:39,943
Uh, with Mayfield, in 22.

719
00:29:41,146 --> 00:29:42,679
Oh. Okay.

720
00:29:42,748 --> 00:29:46,516
That... Sure. Yeah, that's
fine. Right, Dr. Bailey?

721
00:29:46,585 --> 00:29:49,352
Some things, Avery, I
just don't need to know.

722
00:29:52,691 --> 00:29:55,241
Avery. Deck tonight?

723
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:56,550
Uh, wouldn't miss it.

724
00:29:56,578 --> 00:29:57,938
We still on for the
AVM Tomorrow?

725
00:29:58,964 --> 00:30:00,613
Yes. Absolutely.

726
00:30:00,682 --> 00:30:02,649
Good. Yes.

727
00:30:10,442 --> 00:30:11,975
I finished. Nineteen pages.

728
00:30:12,044 --> 00:30:13,627
Oh, well done.

729
00:30:13,696 --> 00:30:14,895
Hey, hand it over.

730
00:30:14,963 --> 00:30:17,630
Oh, no. It's not
ready for anyone to...

731
00:30:17,699 --> 00:30:19,382
Hey, dude, give that back.

732
00:30:19,451 --> 00:30:21,229
You're gonna fight the Chief?

733
00:30:21,253 --> 00:30:22,536
You're not the Chief.

734
00:30:22,605 --> 00:30:25,239
Once you're the President,
you're always Mr. President.

735
00:30:27,542 --> 00:30:30,794
Now Shepherd wants me on his
surgery, which is great, obviously,

736
00:30:30,862 --> 00:30:34,197
but I'm supposed to be in surgery
with Sloan at the same time.

737
00:30:34,265 --> 00:30:35,482
How am I supposed to choose?

738
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:37,612
Who do you want
to work with more?

739
00:30:37,636 --> 00:30:39,036
I dig plastics,

740
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:41,704
but I'd like to actually
be able to operate.

741
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:44,223
Well, you're choosing between
two world-class surgeons.

742
00:30:44,292 --> 00:30:47,038
This is not a problem. It
is a privilege. Embrace it.

743
00:30:47,062 --> 00:30:48,428
Yeah, feel the joy.

744
00:30:49,081 --> 00:30:51,848
Look at you.

745
00:30:51,917 --> 00:30:54,295
Hey, how'd you get out of
your skills lab with Bailey?

746
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:56,403
Oh. Mayfield excuse.

747
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:01,052
You used the Mayfield
excuse on Bailey?

748
00:31:01,076 --> 00:31:02,676
Yes, sir.

749
00:31:06,081 --> 00:31:08,161
I know, right?

750
00:31:08,883 --> 00:31:10,584
Right?

751
00:31:10,653 --> 00:31:12,018
You... With Bailey?

752
00:31:15,791 --> 00:31:17,107
You want a grape?

753
00:31:22,181 --> 00:31:23,413
What happened?

754
00:31:23,481 --> 00:31:24,725
Well, you must have run
the CT wrong or something,

755
00:31:24,749 --> 00:31:25,927
because it's been over 27 hours,

756
00:31:25,951 --> 00:31:27,545
and she still hasn't cried yet.

757
00:31:27,569 --> 00:31:28,689
Something's wrong.

758
00:31:28,754 --> 00:31:30,620
You want to know why
your kid isn't crying?

759
00:31:30,689 --> 00:31:32,105
Because she likes you.

760
00:31:32,174 --> 00:31:35,041
You're a good dad. She's happy.

761
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:36,376
You want to see her cry?

762
00:31:38,547 --> 00:31:40,264
There. Now she's crying.

763
00:31:43,969 --> 00:31:45,335
It's okay.

764
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:46,586
It's okay.

765
00:32:00,902 --> 00:32:02,402
They look happy.

766
00:32:02,471 --> 00:32:03,903
Yeah, they do.

767
00:32:03,972 --> 00:32:06,292
Guess I'll be seeing
you at the deck tonight.

768
00:32:11,296 --> 00:32:13,663
The guy was twice my
size. What was I thinking?

769
00:32:14,466 --> 00:32:15,665
I'm an idiot.

770
00:32:15,733 --> 00:32:17,317
Or a hobbit. What?

771
00:32:17,386 --> 00:32:18,585
That's what you said, right?

772
00:32:18,654 --> 00:32:20,614
When hobbits find adventure,
they become heroes.

773
00:32:20,755 --> 00:32:21,888
You stepped up.

774
00:32:21,956 --> 00:32:23,957
All right, so you got
flattened by a giant.

775
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:25,792
It's still cool.

776
00:32:25,861 --> 00:32:27,894
And I'm not the only
one who thinks so.

777
00:32:29,631 --> 00:32:32,933
All right. Remember...

778
00:32:33,001 --> 00:32:35,251
All you have to do is
say hi. Let her do the rest.

779
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,870
Wait. Wait. Hang on.

780
00:32:36,939 --> 00:32:38,288
Hey.

781
00:32:38,357 --> 00:32:40,156
Thank you for what you did,

782
00:32:40,225 --> 00:32:44,277
standing up to that guy the
other day. That was so brave.

783
00:32:44,345 --> 00:32:45,478
I was a hobbit.

784
00:32:46,648 --> 00:32:48,181
Oh.

785
00:32:48,249 --> 00:32:51,551
Okay. I'm not really
familiar with hobbits,

786
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:53,419
but anyway, that...

787
00:32:53,488 --> 00:32:55,121
Okay. Thank you. Bye.

788
00:32:56,524 --> 00:32:58,524
Whatever happened
to just saying hi?

789
00:33:00,863 --> 00:33:02,106
Not familiar with hobbits?

790
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:03,597
They're only the central figures

791
00:33:03,665 --> 00:33:05,543
in one of the most famous
pieces of literature in history,

792
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:07,545
not to mention the subject
of one of the highest-grossing

793
00:33:07,569 --> 00:33:08,968
film franchises ever,

794
00:33:09,037 --> 00:33:11,604
but, okay, not familiar
with hobbits. Sure.

795
00:33:14,225 --> 00:33:15,292
Hi.

796
00:33:17,296 --> 00:33:18,428
Hey.

797
00:33:22,084 --> 00:33:23,383
You get that ear prepped yet?

798
00:33:24,586 --> 00:33:26,252
I may

799
00:33:26,321 --> 00:33:28,099
have to scrub out
of your rhinoplasty

800
00:33:28,123 --> 00:33:31,657
just a little early
tomorrow, if that's okay.

801
00:33:31,726 --> 00:33:33,426
You're in my light.

802
00:33:33,495 --> 00:33:35,706
Uh, last night,
Shepherd asked me

803
00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:37,475
to scrub in on his AVM surgery,

804
00:33:37,499 --> 00:33:39,780
which is a big
opportunity for me,

805
00:33:39,834 --> 00:33:42,146
because he's gonna... He's
gonna let me take the lead, so...

806
00:33:42,170 --> 00:33:43,336
Last night?

807
00:33:43,405 --> 00:33:44,671
Yeah.

808
00:33:44,739 --> 00:33:47,390
You were with Shepherd
last night? Where?

809
00:33:47,459 --> 00:33:49,092
Oh, just...

810
00:33:50,629 --> 00:33:52,795
What? Hmm? At his deck.

811
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:53,963
At his deck?

812
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:55,064
Yeah.

813
00:33:58,637 --> 00:33:59,852
You're right.

814
00:33:59,921 --> 00:34:03,457
Taking the lead on a
surgery is a big opportunity

815
00:34:03,525 --> 00:34:05,475
you should not pass up.

816
00:34:06,145 --> 00:34:07,511
That's why...

817
00:34:07,579 --> 00:34:09,712
I'd like you to
take the lead now.

818
00:34:09,781 --> 00:34:12,249
Sew this guy's ear
back on by yourself.

819
00:34:18,406 --> 00:34:19,756
Thank you.

820
00:34:20,893 --> 00:34:22,492
Don't screw it up.

821
00:34:27,932 --> 00:34:30,066
Hello. I'm Dr. Hunt.

822
00:34:30,135 --> 00:34:32,746
I am the surgeon who
repaired your broken jaw.

823
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:36,422
I am also the guy who broke it.

824
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:38,792
It's wired shut right now, so

825
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:40,100
I'll do the talking.

826
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:42,729
Now they want me
to come down here

827
00:34:42,798 --> 00:34:44,197
and apologize to you,

828
00:34:44,265 --> 00:34:46,666
and I want to make
something quite clear.

829
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:50,136
I feel good about what I did.

830
00:34:50,205 --> 00:34:52,183
Now, I reviewed
the security tape,

831
00:34:52,207 --> 00:34:53,740
and I easily prevented

832
00:34:53,809 --> 00:34:56,393
half a dozen people
being injured by you.

833
00:34:56,461 --> 00:34:59,396
You assaulted a
girl with a beer bottle.

834
00:34:59,464 --> 00:35:04,066
You attacked hospital staff.
You put a man on the critical list.

835
00:35:04,136 --> 00:35:07,348
You were violent and abusive
in front of dozens of witnesses,

836
00:35:07,372 --> 00:35:09,417
and I will stand up
in any court of law

837
00:35:09,441 --> 00:35:12,309
and say just that.

838
00:35:12,377 --> 00:35:14,877
I do not apologize for
things I feel good about,

839
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:17,496
and I feel good about this.

840
00:35:17,566 --> 00:35:19,166
So...

841
00:35:19,217 --> 00:35:20,683
If you want to sue,

842
00:35:21,419 --> 00:35:22,785
you sue.

843
00:35:28,026 --> 00:35:30,266
And good luck
with your recovery.

844
00:35:40,121 --> 00:35:41,588
Take a look.

845
00:35:42,323 --> 00:35:43,590
Dr. Jason Mayfield,

846
00:35:43,658 --> 00:35:45,592
ED specialist?

847
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:48,895
Room 22. Mayfield in 22.

848
00:35:48,963 --> 00:35:51,259
You told Bailey you
had erectile dysfunction.

849
00:35:52,384 --> 00:35:53,399
You told Shepherd.

850
00:35:55,387 --> 00:35:57,753
Oh, hey, Karev. There you are.

851
00:35:57,823 --> 00:35:59,138
Just read your paper.

852
00:35:59,207 --> 00:36:01,391
Excellent first draft.

853
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:02,725
Oh, uh, and...

854
00:36:02,778 --> 00:36:04,778
Don't hang out by Mayfield.

855
00:36:04,846 --> 00:36:06,146
People get the wrong idea.

856
00:36:06,615 --> 00:36:07,814
Yeah.

857
00:36:12,537 --> 00:36:14,754
This looks fantastic, Keith.

858
00:36:17,125 --> 00:36:19,659
You should have
very minimal scarring.

859
00:36:21,947 --> 00:36:24,347
Oh! Go away. GREG: No.

860
00:36:24,415 --> 00:36:28,068
Sorry? I've got a bad ear.
Pretty sure I didn't hear that right.

861
00:36:28,136 --> 00:36:30,604
Okay, yeah, I sold the TARDIS.

862
00:36:30,672 --> 00:36:33,256
But as your friend, I'm
gonna be honest with you.

863
00:36:33,324 --> 00:36:35,153
It was the right thing to do.

864
00:36:35,177 --> 00:36:38,055
Our place is crammed
with all that stuff you collect.

865
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:41,191
You spend all your
money on it. You're broke.

866
00:36:41,215 --> 00:36:42,593
And do you have
any idea how many

867
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:43,944
medical bills you're
about to have?

868
00:36:43,968 --> 00:36:45,785
That TARDIS was worth cash.

869
00:36:45,854 --> 00:36:48,521
Real, actual cash
that you don't have.

870
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:51,902
So, yeah, I am sorry that I
sold your precious TARDIS.

871
00:36:51,926 --> 00:36:53,793
I am.

872
00:36:53,862 --> 00:36:55,512
But I did it for you.

873
00:37:02,537 --> 00:37:05,138
Who'd you sell it to, anyway?

874
00:37:05,206 --> 00:37:07,940
The guy with the comic
store. The one in San Diego.

875
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:11,377
Morris? Ugh! I hate that guy.

876
00:37:11,446 --> 00:37:12,728
How much did you get for it?

877
00:37:12,797 --> 00:37:14,080
$7,500.

878
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:18,268
Well, he ripped you off.

879
00:37:24,326 --> 00:37:25,558
What's wrong with you?

880
00:37:25,627 --> 00:37:27,327
The chief beat the
crap out of my paper.

881
00:37:27,396 --> 00:37:29,078
I basically have
to start all over.

882
00:37:29,147 --> 00:37:30,313
I can't believe this.

883
00:37:30,382 --> 00:37:31,692
I am back where I
started three days ago.

884
00:37:31,716 --> 00:37:34,784
No paper, no neuro
cases. I mean, it sucks.

885
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:38,588
Grab your coat.

886
00:37:48,817 --> 00:37:50,316
This is a bad idea.

887
00:37:50,385 --> 00:37:51,851
Shepherd hates me.

888
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,352
I hate the woods.

889
00:37:53,421 --> 00:37:55,555
You know there
are bears out here?

890
00:37:55,623 --> 00:37:57,773
I hope you don't mind.

891
00:37:57,842 --> 00:37:59,109
I brought Karev.

892
00:38:05,083 --> 00:38:07,667
Fifth year is really
kicking my ass.

893
00:38:07,736 --> 00:38:09,136
I mean, it's no
excuse, all right?

894
00:38:09,203 --> 00:38:12,137
But I didn't mean to be
disrespectful or whatever.

895
00:38:13,725 --> 00:38:16,826
Also, I lied about
Mayfield, just to be clear.

896
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:30,373
Derek.

897
00:38:30,442 --> 00:38:32,825
You're trying to steal my guy.

898
00:38:32,894 --> 00:38:35,361
He's my guy. Avery,
go get in the car.

899
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:36,540
What? No. Mark...

900
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:37,742
You've been moving
in on him all week.

901
00:38:37,766 --> 00:38:38,910
You weren't even
interested in him

902
00:38:38,934 --> 00:38:40,533
till you saw how
much he meant to me.

903
00:38:40,602 --> 00:38:43,770
I don't take the time to
teach anyone if I can help it.

904
00:38:43,838 --> 00:38:45,649
Mark... But I'm taking
the time with Avery

905
00:38:45,673 --> 00:38:47,240
because he's a quick learner

906
00:38:47,308 --> 00:38:49,668
and he can do a z-plasty
better than I could at his level.

907
00:38:49,694 --> 00:38:51,374
I can?

908
00:38:52,013 --> 00:38:53,279
Hey, hey, don't do that.

909
00:38:53,347 --> 00:38:55,042
Don't just yell at
me, then walk away.

910
00:38:55,066 --> 00:38:57,100
I'm not. It's just, Sofia
likes it if I'm moving.

911
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:58,517
Oh.

912
00:38:58,587 --> 00:39:00,302
You guys talk.

913
00:39:00,371 --> 00:39:01,611
I'll take the baby.

914
00:39:03,324 --> 00:39:05,335
Okay, careful. We
had a scare this week.

915
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:06,403
Okay. All right.

916
00:39:06,427 --> 00:39:07,459
Now...

917
00:39:09,214 --> 00:39:10,546
Thank you.

918
00:39:10,615 --> 00:39:12,114
Avery, go get in the car!

919
00:39:13,451 --> 00:39:15,151
How are you tonight?

920
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:18,188
You good? You want
to come and sit with me?

921
00:39:18,256 --> 00:39:19,422
Here we go.

922
00:39:19,491 --> 00:39:20,990
We're just gonna sit right here

923
00:39:21,059 --> 00:39:23,209
and have a look at
the little tree up there.

924
00:39:23,277 --> 00:39:24,944
Friends don't steal
from each other.

925
00:39:25,013 --> 00:39:27,830
It's not stealing if he asks
to scrub in on my surgery.

926
00:39:27,899 --> 00:39:29,009
- Don't be a jackass.
- All right, look.

927
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:30,850
I appreciate this, I do,

928
00:39:30,918 --> 00:39:33,158
but if I have to choose,
I choose plastics.

929
00:39:33,405 --> 00:39:34,687
I mean, I really appreciate

930
00:39:34,756 --> 00:39:36,267
being able to take the
lead on your neurosurgeries,

931
00:39:36,291 --> 00:39:38,541
but I feel like... You
using my boy here

932
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:40,443
to get more surgery?

933
00:39:40,512 --> 00:39:42,345
Nobody uses my boy.

934
00:39:45,617 --> 00:39:47,628
Why are we the only
ones with hammers?

935
00:39:47,652 --> 00:39:49,018
I'm getting a beer.

936
00:39:49,788 --> 00:39:51,788
<i>Be a man.</i>

937
00:39:51,856 --> 00:39:53,289
<i>People say it all the time.</i>

938
00:39:53,357 --> 00:39:54,677
You want to play with the truck?

939
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:56,759
You can touch the truck.

940
00:39:56,827 --> 00:39:58,787
<i>But what does that even mean?</i>

941
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:10,205
Honey.

942
00:40:10,274 --> 00:40:11,407
Dinner's ready.

943
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,710
<i>Is it about strength?</i>

944
00:40:16,097 --> 00:40:18,331
We're gonna sing a song

945
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,415
and look at the tree.

946
00:40:20,252 --> 00:40:21,417
Are you tired?

947
00:40:21,486 --> 00:40:23,619
You're tired. Right?

948
00:40:23,688 --> 00:40:25,604
<i>Is it about sacrifice?</i>

949
00:40:25,674 --> 00:40:27,914
What do you think
they're talking about?

950
00:40:29,126 --> 00:40:30,426
My guess?

951
00:40:30,495 --> 00:40:32,361
Which one of 'em gets
to take you to prom.

952
00:40:36,034 --> 00:40:37,366
<i>Is it about winning?</i>

953
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:40,319
<i>Maybe it's simpler than that.</i>

954
00:40:41,722 --> 00:40:43,155
You're not getting laid.

955
00:40:43,224 --> 00:40:45,574
That's why you have this
sudden interest in education.

956
00:40:47,846 --> 00:40:50,046
When Richard asked you
who should be the next Chief,

957
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:53,449
did my name come up?

958
00:40:55,603 --> 00:40:57,563
You just had a baby.
You don't want to be Chief.

959
00:40:58,339 --> 00:40:59,905
And he didn't ask me.

960
00:40:59,974 --> 00:41:01,974
What if he'd asked?

961
00:41:03,511 --> 00:41:04,710
You just had a baby.

962
00:41:11,403 --> 00:41:13,736
You know, a few weeks ago,

963
00:41:13,805 --> 00:41:17,607
I knew exactly how the
next 10 years would play out.

964
00:41:19,043 --> 00:41:20,976
Work, family...

965
00:41:21,713 --> 00:41:23,513
And then...

966
00:41:25,183 --> 00:41:27,566
I lost the trial, baby...

967
00:41:29,303 --> 00:41:31,537
Blacklisted by the
FDA and Meredith...

968
00:41:36,244 --> 00:41:38,884
Some days, I miss her so much,
I don't know if I'm gonna make it.

969
00:41:40,949 --> 00:41:43,132
<i>You have to know
when not to man up.</i>

970
00:41:43,201 --> 00:41:45,321
Did you tell Hunt any of this?

971
00:41:46,054 --> 00:41:47,786
I did not. Just checking.

972
00:41:48,956 --> 00:41:51,356
I think Sofia needs a change.

973
00:41:54,195 --> 00:41:55,295
Here.

974
00:41:59,968 --> 00:42:01,745
I'll tell you what
else you don't know,

975
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:03,236
is how to build a deck.

976
00:42:04,256 --> 00:42:05,755
This thing isn't level.

977
00:42:05,823 --> 00:42:07,257
I gotta call my contractor.

978
00:42:08,726 --> 00:42:10,860
<i>Sometimes it takes a real man</i>

979
00:42:10,929 --> 00:42:13,363
<i>to set his ego aside,</i>

980
00:42:13,431 --> 00:42:14,998
<i>admit defeat,</i>

981
00:42:15,066 --> 00:42:16,399
<i>and simply...</i>

982
00:42:16,467 --> 00:42:19,369
<i>Start all over again.</i>
