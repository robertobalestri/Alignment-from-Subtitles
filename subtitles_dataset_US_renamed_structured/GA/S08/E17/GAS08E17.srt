1
00:00:02,403 --> 00:00:04,736
<i>We're trained to be vigilant.</i>

2
00:00:06,624 --> 00:00:08,590
<i>To chase down the problem.</i>

3
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:13,878
What...

4
00:00:14,548 --> 00:00:15,548
Hi.

5
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,100
Hey.

6
00:00:18,168 --> 00:00:20,486
<i>To ask all the right questions.</i>

7
00:00:25,426 --> 00:00:27,426
<i>To find the root cause.</i>

8
00:00:38,638 --> 00:00:41,539
<i>Until we know
exactly what it is.</i>

9
00:00:41,608 --> 00:00:44,443
Dr. Hunt, please.

10
00:00:44,511 --> 00:00:47,845
No, he did not go home for the
night. This is Dr. Yang. Page him.

11
00:00:48,582 --> 00:00:49,948
No, I will hold.

12
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:54,603
<i>And we can confront it.</i>

13
00:00:55,172 --> 00:00:56,237
You are.

14
00:01:07,435 --> 00:01:09,434
What? What is it?

15
00:01:09,503 --> 00:01:11,186
You didn't come home.

16
00:01:11,272 --> 00:01:12,804
Yeah, there was a bus crash.

17
00:01:12,873 --> 00:01:14,806
What time is it? What
are you doing here?

18
00:01:14,874 --> 00:01:16,141
I just...

19
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:18,491
I figured you had a rough night,

20
00:01:18,645 --> 00:01:19,711
so...

21
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:22,448
I brought you some coffee.

22
00:01:23,184 --> 00:01:24,783
Great. Thanks.

23
00:01:24,852 --> 00:01:26,796
<i>It takes an extreme
amount of caution.</i>

24
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:27,869
Where is it?

25
00:01:30,073 --> 00:01:31,189
I forgot it.

26
00:01:31,258 --> 00:01:32,741
But, um...

27
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:34,526
You go back to sleep.

28
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:35,677
Okay.

29
00:01:37,648 --> 00:01:39,848
<i>Or we can overstep ourselves.</i>

30
00:01:46,974 --> 00:01:50,642
<i>We can create problems
where none exist.</i>

31
00:01:50,711 --> 00:01:52,310
Come back to me.

32
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:53,645
I'm not coming back.

33
00:01:53,714 --> 00:01:54,757
You miss it.

34
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,081
What's to miss about neuro?

35
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:57,449
Me.

36
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,353
We decided it was a bad idea.

37
00:02:01,422 --> 00:02:04,923
Well, that was before, when
we were trying to get Zola back.

38
00:02:04,992 --> 00:02:08,104
I miss you. Just
come back for one day.

39
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:10,862
Remember the
mystery... The magic...

40
00:02:10,931 --> 00:02:12,497
Gliomas...

41
00:02:12,566 --> 00:02:14,066
Meningiomas...

42
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,400
Astrocytomas!

43
00:02:21,442 --> 00:02:22,707
Dr. Webber?

44
00:02:23,277 --> 00:02:24,542
Dr. Webber.

45
00:02:25,745 --> 00:02:27,446
Rise and shine, Richard.

46
00:02:27,514 --> 00:02:29,898
Dr. Avery is here for
our bladder surgery.

47
00:02:29,967 --> 00:02:31,516
Oh, right. Right.

48
00:02:31,569 --> 00:02:34,002
Hey, hey. Hi, Catherine.

49
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:37,055
Oh, take your time, honey. I
want to see this bladder you baked.

50
00:02:37,123 --> 00:02:40,192
Look at that. Dr. Keaton.

51
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,578
Homegrown from the patient's
own bladder and stem cells.

52
00:02:43,647 --> 00:02:44,979
Beautiful.

53
00:02:45,048 --> 00:02:47,026
All those late-night
calls paid off, didn't they?

54
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:49,195
Yeah, we couldn't have done
it without your consultation.

55
00:02:49,219 --> 00:02:50,635
Flatterer.

56
00:02:50,704 --> 00:02:52,782
All right. Well, before we
stick this thing someplace

57
00:02:52,806 --> 00:02:55,907
where the sun don't shine,
I'm gonna go and find my son.

58
00:02:55,976 --> 00:02:59,011
And you should go
and find a pot of coffee.

59
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:00,079
Yeah.

60
00:03:00,146 --> 00:03:01,207
I'll see you before surgery.

61
00:03:01,231 --> 00:03:02,414
Dr. Keaton.

62
00:03:03,633 --> 00:03:04,800
All right.

63
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:08,070
Late night, sir?

64
00:03:08,138 --> 00:03:12,040
I'm fine. I sit with Adele
till she falls asleep,

65
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:13,552
then I like to be
there in the morning.

66
00:03:13,576 --> 00:03:15,221
But when do you have
time to get some sleep?

67
00:03:15,245 --> 00:03:16,328
I'm fine, Bailey.

68
00:03:18,849 --> 00:03:19,914
I'm fine.

69
00:03:21,435 --> 00:03:22,734
Yes, sir.

70
00:03:24,004 --> 00:03:25,904
Get your scrambled
egg off my blanket.

71
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:28,340
I said I'd bring you one.
You said you weren't hungry.

72
00:03:28,409 --> 00:03:30,742
You are gonna have
heart failure at 35.

73
00:03:30,811 --> 00:03:32,611
No, give me another card.

74
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:34,558
Don't you feel bad, using a
distraught mother to help tutor you?

75
00:03:34,582 --> 00:03:37,098
No. I feel bad that I had
to sit with you all night

76
00:03:37,167 --> 00:03:39,412
so you wouldn't cry yourself
to sleep over your sad preemie.

77
00:03:39,436 --> 00:03:40,635
He has a brain bleed.

78
00:03:40,704 --> 00:03:43,822
No, he barely has a brain bleed.

79
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:47,175
Look, we expected
it. I'm watching it.

80
00:03:47,243 --> 00:03:48,388
Oh, that's supposed
to make me feel good?

81
00:03:48,412 --> 00:03:50,178
You are this close
to failing your boards.

82
00:03:50,264 --> 00:03:51,746
Don't even say that.

83
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:54,135
I know exactly what they'll
ask that's gonna take you down.

84
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:56,228
Is it Robbins? I gotta go.

85
00:03:56,252 --> 00:03:57,919
It's Robbins. I'm coming, too.

86
00:04:00,123 --> 00:04:02,490
Hey. Have you seen
Derek? Have you seen Owen?

87
00:04:02,559 --> 00:04:04,270
He put me on his
service. I told him not to,

88
00:04:04,294 --> 00:04:05,838
and he gives me
an arachnoid cyst.

89
00:04:05,862 --> 00:04:07,740
I have to pull the plug
on a brain-dead trauma.

90
00:04:07,764 --> 00:04:09,564
I need Owen to approve it.

91
00:04:09,632 --> 00:04:10,832
There he is.

92
00:04:11,435 --> 00:04:13,368
Hey.

93
00:04:13,437 --> 00:04:14,964
Don't take too much.
That's my lunch.

94
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:16,566
Fine. All right.
Thanks. Okay, bye.

95
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,834
So he's just sharing his
nasty trail mix with someone.

96
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:21,258
I mean, people do that.
It doesn't mean anything.

97
00:04:21,962 --> 00:04:24,042
Cristina. What?

98
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:25,191
I gotta go find Derek.

99
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:26,414
Okay.

100
00:04:26,483 --> 00:04:27,843
Okay, let's go over
the game plan again.

101
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:29,011
If we see my mother...

102
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:31,536
We're buried with work today.

103
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:34,473
And you're sorry, but
Jackson has no time

104
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:35,924
to spend with her, okay?

105
00:04:35,992 --> 00:04:37,059
There you are.

106
00:04:37,911 --> 00:04:39,043
Dr. Avery.

107
00:04:39,113 --> 00:04:41,562
Dr. Sloan. How nice
to see you again.

108
00:04:41,631 --> 00:04:44,365
Now move out of my
way so I can see my boy.

109
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:47,585
You look skinny.

110
00:04:47,655 --> 00:04:49,403
Tell me you did
not forget your tux.

111
00:04:49,472 --> 00:04:50,555
Tux?

112
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:51,834
Jackson is my date,

113
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:54,492
for the frontiers of
medicine benefit tonight.

114
00:04:54,561 --> 00:04:56,545
Oh! This is Dr. Mara Keaton.

115
00:04:56,613 --> 00:04:58,697
Mara is my star urology fellow.

116
00:04:58,765 --> 00:05:00,798
Mara, my son Jackson.

117
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:01,867
Hey.

118
00:05:01,935 --> 00:05:03,618
Dr. Mark Sloan.

119
00:05:03,687 --> 00:05:05,064
It's a pleasure
to meet you both.

120
00:05:05,088 --> 00:05:06,421
Pleasure to meet you.

121
00:05:06,489 --> 00:05:09,185
Mara's considering Seattle
Grace as an option for next year,

122
00:05:09,209 --> 00:05:10,508
and I thought, well,

123
00:05:10,577 --> 00:05:13,472
who better to show her
around than my son?

124
00:05:13,496 --> 00:05:16,664
Dr. Sloan, can you spare
him for just a couple of hours?

125
00:05:17,868 --> 00:05:19,284
Absolutely.

126
00:05:19,353 --> 00:05:22,354
Show her around. Take your time.

127
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:25,791
I can't possibly. We
are buried with work.

128
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:27,036
Kepner can cover for you.

129
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,187
Perfect. Perfect.

130
00:05:28,211 --> 00:05:29,293
Perfect.

131
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:38,704
So, this is it?

132
00:05:41,075 --> 00:05:42,106
We do it now?

133
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,742
Unless...

134
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:45,477
Do you need a minute
to say something...

135
00:05:45,546 --> 00:05:46,678
I've said it.

136
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:48,696
He's been listening
to me talk for 22 years.

137
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:50,898
I'm sure he's grateful for
a little peace and quiet.

138
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:57,939
What now?

139
00:05:58,008 --> 00:05:59,652
We'll turn off the ventilator.

140
00:05:59,676 --> 00:06:01,409
His respirations will stop.

141
00:06:01,478 --> 00:06:04,212
I'll disconnect his monitors
and his feeding tube...

142
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:06,209
And then... He said this once...

143
00:06:06,233 --> 00:06:08,099
We were watching
some dumb movie on TV

144
00:06:08,151 --> 00:06:11,002
and this guy pulls the
plug on another guy...

145
00:06:12,856 --> 00:06:14,673
He said, "Don't you
dare do that to me."

146
00:06:14,742 --> 00:06:16,941
He was joking. "Don't
you do that to me.

147
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:20,362
"You leave that plug in the
wall, you put my organs in a jar.

148
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:23,665
"Don't you give up on me."

149
00:06:24,834 --> 00:06:27,502
Stop. Stop this.
Stop it. Stop it.

150
00:06:29,155 --> 00:06:31,255
Stop. I can't do this.

151
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:33,207
I can't do this.
Turn this back on.

152
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,510
Turn it back on.

153
00:06:40,284 --> 00:06:41,950
The husband withdrew
consent, Owen.

154
00:06:42,018 --> 00:06:44,046
I had already turned off
the vent when he said no.

155
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,132
He has medical POA.
He said stop. I stopped.

156
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:47,238
So what are you gonna do?

157
00:06:47,307 --> 00:06:48,918
I'm going to get in on
Teddy's preemie surgery.

158
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:50,441
No, you're not.

159
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,837
You're gonna stay with him
until he gives his consent again.

160
00:06:51,861 --> 00:06:52,938
You want me to try
and talk him into it?

161
00:06:52,962 --> 00:06:54,173
No, I want you to
help him through it.

162
00:06:54,197 --> 00:06:55,474
I want you to help
him understand

163
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:57,538
that this is the only
option left for his husband.

164
00:06:57,584 --> 00:07:00,852
I want you to do your job and
find some damn compassion.

165
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:02,904
Do you need something?

166
00:07:02,973 --> 00:07:05,013
I just wonder if I could help.

167
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:07,108
No.

168
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:09,405
I've been with these guys
since Michael first came in.

169
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,079
And we've talked. They know me.

170
00:07:11,148 --> 00:07:12,730
Aren't you on nights now?

171
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:14,444
Well, I can hang
around if it'll help.

172
00:07:14,468 --> 00:07:15,901
Well, I don't... Cristina,

173
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:18,086
she can help, let her help.

174
00:07:18,155 --> 00:07:19,254
Thank you.

175
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:24,576
Thanks.

176
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:38,567
So I'm a week out of
law school... Uh-huh.

177
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:40,202
First big interview, huge firm.

178
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:41,804
I've never had a
better interview.

179
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:44,678
So I stand up to shake
hands, and I pass out...

180
00:07:44,747 --> 00:07:46,725
Right over the coffee table.
Draped over the coffee table

181
00:07:46,749 --> 00:07:47,977
with my butt in the
air. And your skirt...

182
00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:49,362
My skirt rides up to my waist.

183
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:51,163
Not even good
panties. Granny panties.

184
00:07:51,187 --> 00:07:52,203
Ooh! Wow.

185
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:53,516
Did you get the job? No.

186
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,300
Well, your next interview
will end much better

187
00:07:55,324 --> 00:07:56,608
once we remove the cyst.

188
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:57,971
We're gonna perform what we call

189
00:07:57,995 --> 00:07:59,355
a marsupialization of the cyst.

190
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:01,891
We open up the wall of the
cyst so that it can drain freely

191
00:08:01,915 --> 00:08:03,326
and then the
fluid won't collect.

192
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,760
So your dizzy spells will stop.

193
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:06,712
But you said you found a tumor.

194
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:09,220
Mmm-hmm. We did. It's a small
one. It's called a meningioma.

195
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:10,866
It's benign, so we're
gonna leave it alone.

196
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:13,135
If it ever does cause a problem,
it's easy enough to remove.

197
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,219
Dr. Grey could do it.

198
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:15,283
Oh. Go, girl.

199
00:08:15,312 --> 00:08:17,011
But the cyst is in
the temporal lobe.

200
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,347
That's what's causing the
seizures and the dizziness.

201
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:20,749
We're gonna go after that.

202
00:08:20,817 --> 00:08:22,800
- So this is it?
- This is it.

203
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:24,714
We will see you
when it is all over.

204
00:08:24,738 --> 00:08:26,321
Thank you.

205
00:08:26,389 --> 00:08:28,267
Dr. Grey. So glad
you could join us.

206
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:29,357
I've been kidnapped.

207
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:30,469
She misses me.

208
00:08:30,493 --> 00:08:31,837
She's not even on neuro anymore.

209
00:08:31,861 --> 00:08:32,693
Well, she's thinking
about coming back.

210
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:34,095
I'm not.

211
00:08:34,164 --> 00:08:36,425
She is. She's
remembering the magic.

212
00:08:36,449 --> 00:08:38,216
Can he even take heart surgery?

213
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:40,185
He has to. He has
a pericardial tumor

214
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:42,464
compressing on his heart.
He's decompensating.

215
00:08:42,488 --> 00:08:43,804
He has a brain bleed.

216
00:08:43,873 --> 00:08:45,684
Shouldn't heart surgery
wait till after it's cleared up?

217
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:47,775
I wish we could, but it
has to happen today.

218
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:49,744
Hey.

219
00:08:49,813 --> 00:08:52,814
So Tommy's hip dysplasia
can be treated with a harness.

220
00:08:52,882 --> 00:08:55,466
And I brought you a scone
since you skipped breakfast.

221
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,869
Oh, thank you. Pumpkin.

222
00:08:58,405 --> 00:08:59,504
Eww.

223
00:08:59,573 --> 00:09:00,693
I'll take it.

224
00:09:01,825 --> 00:09:02,902
Eat that.

225
00:09:02,926 --> 00:09:03,926
Right. Like I can eat.

226
00:09:05,445 --> 00:09:07,323
You didn't eat all night.
You're gonna pass out.

227
00:09:07,347 --> 00:09:09,080
Just eat it.

228
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:10,681
When are you going
to do the surgery?

229
00:09:10,751 --> 00:09:11,883
As soon as he's prepped.

230
00:09:11,952 --> 00:09:13,062
Karev will let you know
when we get started.

231
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:14,313
Yeah, I'm gonna scrub in, right?

232
00:09:14,337 --> 00:09:15,614
You just want him
to have surgery

233
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:16,883
'cause it'll look
good for your boards.

234
00:09:16,907 --> 00:09:18,223
I do not.

235
00:09:18,292 --> 00:09:21,225
And also I do, but it's
gonna be great for my boards.

236
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:22,805
Look, he's gonna
be fine, all right?

237
00:09:22,829 --> 00:09:24,896
He's not scrubbing
in. He was up all night.

238
00:09:24,965 --> 00:09:27,031
Oh, shut up.

239
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,678
Should Karev really
be hooking up with

240
00:09:28,702 --> 00:09:30,245
the heart-patient
intern mom? I mean...

241
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:32,169
What? No, he's not.

242
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:34,121
He spent the night.
He gave her a scone.

243
00:09:34,191 --> 00:09:35,823
You gave me a scone.

244
00:09:35,892 --> 00:09:38,572
Yeah, I spend the night with you,
too, because I'm married to you.

245
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:41,563
No. No. She's his intern.

246
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:44,098
I mean, he's just trying
to be nice, to care.

247
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:46,012
I mean, Alex Karev is
trying to be more human,

248
00:09:46,036 --> 00:09:48,653
and I think that we
can thank me for that.

249
00:09:49,973 --> 00:09:51,622
They're doing it.

250
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:53,725
They built you a
beautiful bladder.

251
00:09:53,794 --> 00:09:55,093
Can I see it?

252
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:56,272
Oh, honey, no. You don't
want to see that thing.

253
00:09:56,296 --> 00:09:57,495
It's nasty.

254
00:09:59,198 --> 00:10:01,411
No, no, picture a bread
bowl like your soup comes in...

255
00:10:01,435 --> 00:10:02,516
Uh-huh.

256
00:10:02,585 --> 00:10:04,630
Only this one is
made out of meat.

257
00:10:04,654 --> 00:10:06,937
Please don't make me
laugh. I'm gonna pee.

258
00:10:09,292 --> 00:10:11,041
Oh, God. There I go.

259
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,877
Oh, sweetheart. I'm so sorry.

260
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:13,978
No, I'm sorry.

261
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:16,159
It's all right. That
should end today.

262
00:10:16,183 --> 00:10:18,061
You won't have to be scared
that your bladder will let go

263
00:10:18,085 --> 00:10:19,117
every time you laugh.

264
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:22,086
Or sneeze or cough or have sex.

265
00:10:22,155 --> 00:10:23,482
You're gonna
have a very full life

266
00:10:23,506 --> 00:10:24,833
when Dr. Avery's done with you.

267
00:10:24,857 --> 00:10:27,558
I like to think that
everybody lives a very full life

268
00:10:27,628 --> 00:10:29,460
once I'm done with them.

269
00:10:33,834 --> 00:10:35,366
And there...

270
00:10:35,435 --> 00:10:36,850
We...

271
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:38,786
Are! Great.

272
00:10:38,854 --> 00:10:41,055
That's a perfect
craniotomy. Right, Dr. Grey?

273
00:10:41,124 --> 00:10:44,059
You dragged me back into neuro to
watch Lexie do a boring procedure?

274
00:10:44,127 --> 00:10:45,443
Hey, it is not boring.

275
00:10:45,512 --> 00:10:47,795
It's her first solo cyst.

276
00:10:47,863 --> 00:10:49,892
Be a big sister. Cheer her on.

277
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:51,260
Shepherd, I've got
a motorcycle cop

278
00:10:51,284 --> 00:10:52,595
open on the table
with a C7 fracture.

279
00:10:52,619 --> 00:10:53,796
I need your eyes on
the cord. Can you...

280
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,130
All right. I'll be
right there. Okay.

281
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:57,394
When you marsupialize
that, make sure that you...

282
00:10:57,423 --> 00:10:59,307
Tack the edges. Yes, I know.

283
00:11:00,109 --> 00:11:01,693
Okay.

284
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:04,057
She knows what she's doing.
Just observe. I'll be right back.

285
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:06,881
If you need anything...
We won't. Go.

286
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:12,102
And this is OR two, which
looks exactly like OR one.

287
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:14,506
You still have to cover
the ER in the fifth year,

288
00:11:14,574 --> 00:11:15,907
and study for your boards?

289
00:11:15,976 --> 00:11:17,970
Yeah, it's a pretty
rigorous program.

290
00:11:17,994 --> 00:11:19,138
Speaking of which, I need to
be getting back to work, so...

291
00:11:19,162 --> 00:11:20,682
Do you mind if we
watch for a second?

292
00:11:22,966 --> 00:11:24,765
Of course.

293
00:11:24,834 --> 00:11:27,535
God. I thought I had
no time for a social life.

294
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:29,270
Are you still dating anyone?

295
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:32,840
Am I still dating?

296
00:11:32,908 --> 00:11:35,443
I mean, are you dating anyone?

297
00:11:35,512 --> 00:11:37,946
Tell me about you.
Where'd you go to school?

298
00:11:38,014 --> 00:11:40,615
Well, my dad's the director
of surgical science at Oxford,

299
00:11:40,683 --> 00:11:42,550
so I did my
preclinical years there.

300
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:43,684
Oxford. Wow.

301
00:11:43,753 --> 00:11:45,303
Then residency at Mass Gen,

302
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:48,222
then I transferred to the Brigham
to study under your mother,

303
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:49,557
and here I am.

304
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:51,303
That's quite a
pedigree, isn't it?

305
00:11:51,327 --> 00:11:54,728
Well, you know, a little hard
work and a lot of good timing.

306
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:56,314
No, I get it.

307
00:11:57,751 --> 00:11:59,433
I totally get it.

308
00:11:59,503 --> 00:12:01,969
Is that Derek Shepherd?
So there's cord damage.

309
00:12:02,038 --> 00:12:03,838
Do you mind if we
stay and watch this for...

310
00:12:05,675 --> 00:12:08,059
Just a few more sutures.

311
00:12:08,128 --> 00:12:11,045
God, I have seen some
tiny little hearts, but...

312
00:12:11,113 --> 00:12:12,981
This is the tiniest.

313
00:12:13,532 --> 00:12:14,565
Whoa.

314
00:12:14,634 --> 00:12:16,195
His pressure's dropped.
What happened?

315
00:12:16,219 --> 00:12:18,614
Doctor, his fontanel is bulging
and the pupils are dilated.

316
00:12:18,638 --> 00:12:20,132
His IVH. Brain bleed.

317
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:21,956
Give me the
ultrasound. Here you go.

318
00:12:26,313 --> 00:12:28,496
Okay. Right there.

319
00:12:28,565 --> 00:12:29,864
It's progressed to stage 3.

320
00:12:29,932 --> 00:12:31,477
He's gonna need a
ventriculostomy fast,

321
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:33,029
or we're looking
at hydrocephalus.

322
00:12:33,053 --> 00:12:34,379
And brain damage. Page Marcus.

323
00:12:34,403 --> 00:12:36,215
No, Shepherd should take
this. No, he's in surgery.

324
00:12:36,239 --> 00:12:37,649
Just page Marcus.
He can handle it.

325
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:39,673
No, the kid's getting
Shepherd. Just wait for me.

326
00:12:46,566 --> 00:12:48,933
The cyst is
draining really well.

327
00:12:49,002 --> 00:12:50,301
Really well.

328
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:51,702
Great job.

329
00:12:51,772 --> 00:12:53,954
Whoa. Where is that
blood coming from?

330
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:55,418
It's all right. It's
just a little bleeding.

331
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:56,735
We just have to find the source.

332
00:12:56,759 --> 00:12:58,487
Let's extend the
craniotomy a little.

333
00:12:58,511 --> 00:12:59,576
Open her up more?

334
00:12:59,645 --> 00:13:00,990
Yeah. It's okay. Just a little.

335
00:13:01,014 --> 00:13:02,680
Okay. Here you go, Doctor.

336
00:13:07,003 --> 00:13:09,081
But I hear stories of people
waking up all the time.

337
00:13:09,105 --> 00:13:10,449
Not this. Not brain death.

338
00:13:10,473 --> 00:13:11,923
But he's still breathing.

339
00:13:11,992 --> 00:13:13,636
The machine is breathing
for him. When we shut it off...

340
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:15,326
He dies. He's already...

341
00:13:16,863 --> 00:13:18,462
Your husband has died.

342
00:13:19,065 --> 00:13:20,314
Oh, good.

343
00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:21,782
Okay, this is an EEG.

344
00:13:21,851 --> 00:13:25,637
It's a brain scan of another
patient in a coma, also ventilated.

345
00:13:25,705 --> 00:13:27,738
These lines
indicate brain activity.

346
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:30,041
You can see these
spikes going all the way.

347
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:33,256
If you take a look at your
husband's, it's completely flat.

348
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,241
We've seen no brain
activity for the past 72 hours...

349
00:13:35,265 --> 00:13:36,364
Just stop.

350
00:13:36,432 --> 00:13:37,876
Well, I'm just
trying to explain...

351
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,951
Explain to me how you
can tell me that he's dead

352
00:13:41,021 --> 00:13:43,454
and then tell me to turn
off life-sustaining treatment.

353
00:13:43,523 --> 00:13:44,739
Explain that.

354
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:48,552
Sam, you can take your time.

355
00:13:48,695 --> 00:13:50,912
This is a difficult decision.

356
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:54,380
You should just be with
Michael and take your time.

357
00:13:57,019 --> 00:13:58,436
Take all the time you need.

358
00:13:58,505 --> 00:13:59,670
Thank you.

359
00:14:02,658 --> 00:14:04,092
It's okay.

360
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,928
It's okay. I know
how hard this is.

361
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,067
Like that?

362
00:14:13,135 --> 00:14:14,863
Uh-huh. There it is. Little
bleeder. Just cauterize.

363
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:15,920
Okay. Bipolar.

364
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:17,068
Here you go.

365
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:21,976
There. Okay.

366
00:14:22,044 --> 00:14:23,538
Look at that. That's her tumor.

367
00:14:23,562 --> 00:14:25,012
What?

368
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,814
Oh, my God. There it is.

369
00:14:26,883 --> 00:14:28,833
Do we take it out?

370
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:31,986
We should...

371
00:14:34,324 --> 00:14:37,820
Let's call OR two and find out
how long Dr. Shepherd's gonna be.

372
00:14:37,844 --> 00:14:40,711
I mean, he said it would
be easy. That I could do it.

373
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,980
I know, and it's right there.

374
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:44,944
They said he's just finishing.
He'll be here any minute.

375
00:14:44,968 --> 00:14:48,013
Okay. All right. Well, let's
just wait and see what he says.

376
00:14:48,037 --> 00:14:49,486
Okay.

377
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,689
Cord's clear.
Spine is stabilized.

378
00:14:51,758 --> 00:14:53,024
What do you think?

379
00:14:53,093 --> 00:14:54,770
Well, I think his
motorcycle days are over.

380
00:14:54,794 --> 00:14:57,072
Hopefully, he'll be
able to walk again.

381
00:14:57,096 --> 00:14:59,279
Dr. Shepherd, we
need you in OR four.

382
00:14:59,348 --> 00:15:01,126
It's Tommy. He's
got a grade-3 bleed.

383
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,411
He needs a ventric
placed. Karev, slow down.

384
00:15:02,435 --> 00:15:03,551
Who is Tommy?

385
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:06,104
Morgan's baby.
The intern Morgan.

386
00:15:06,172 --> 00:15:07,633
All right. Well, just give
me a second to finish...

387
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:09,073
Can you come now? Please.

388
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:12,259
Go. I'll finish. Okay.

389
00:15:13,929 --> 00:15:15,296
Where's your hot tourist?

390
00:15:15,365 --> 00:15:17,898
Yeah, she's not here for
a tour. I'm being set up.

391
00:15:17,967 --> 00:15:19,744
My mom's trying to
expand the Avery dynasty.

392
00:15:19,768 --> 00:15:21,614
You were supposed
to tell her we were busy.

393
00:15:21,638 --> 00:15:24,233
You and Dr. Hotness should be
getting busy, if you get my point.

394
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:26,857
Actually, she should
be getting your point.

395
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,593
What are you, 12?

396
00:15:28,662 --> 00:15:30,422
Why are you so obsessed
with me getting laid?

397
00:15:30,446 --> 00:15:33,347
'Cause it works for me. It's
called passing on wisdom.

398
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:34,615
Also pimping.

399
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:36,016
She's here for one night.

400
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:39,570
No.

401
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:41,679
I am not going to give
my mother the satisfaction.

402
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:47,489
It's not your mother you
should be trying to satisfy.

403
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:48,712
Child!

404
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:55,369
Sam.

405
00:15:57,006 --> 00:15:59,207
Is there...

406
00:15:59,275 --> 00:16:00,419
Do you have any
questions I can answer?

407
00:16:00,443 --> 00:16:01,508
No, thank you.

408
00:16:03,663 --> 00:16:06,863
If you could stop circling
like a vulture, I'd appreciate it.

409
00:16:15,408 --> 00:16:17,241
Do you want me to talk to him?

410
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:18,826
No.

411
00:16:18,895 --> 00:16:21,629
He just needs time to grieve,
you know, to work through it.

412
00:16:21,698 --> 00:16:22,938
He needs to think clearly.

413
00:16:22,998 --> 00:16:24,676
He needs to understand
what has happened.

414
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,617
He's losing his husband.

415
00:16:28,254 --> 00:16:30,304
They were going
to a grocery store,

416
00:16:30,373 --> 00:16:32,406
just living their
nice, boring life,

417
00:16:32,475 --> 00:16:34,586
going to the same store
they've gone to for 22 years,

418
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:36,611
and a car hits them.

419
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:37,861
Sam never saw this coming.

420
00:16:39,014 --> 00:16:40,258
Like I said, I
just... I've taken

421
00:16:40,282 --> 00:16:41,460
some time to get to know them...

422
00:16:41,484 --> 00:16:43,718
Are you married? Have
you ever been married?

423
00:16:45,422 --> 00:16:46,471
No.

424
00:16:46,539 --> 00:16:47,683
Then stay out of it.

425
00:16:47,707 --> 00:16:49,635
You have no idea what
you're talking about.

426
00:16:49,659 --> 00:16:51,441
You don't know Sam.

427
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:54,790
You don't know the first
thing about what he needs.

428
00:16:57,917 --> 00:16:59,584
There you are.

429
00:16:59,652 --> 00:17:01,035
What are you doing here?

430
00:17:01,104 --> 00:17:03,570
We're finished. The cyst
is draining. She did great.

431
00:17:03,639 --> 00:17:05,917
And get this. Lexie
resected the meningioma,

432
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:08,509
perfect margins.
She was perfect.

433
00:17:08,578 --> 00:17:10,578
You did what?
Took the tumor out.

434
00:17:10,646 --> 00:17:12,486
Why the hell would you do that?

435
00:17:16,803 --> 00:17:18,414
The plan was to remove the cyst.

436
00:17:18,438 --> 00:17:19,982
She did not consent
to that surgery.

437
00:17:20,006 --> 00:17:21,305
The tumor was right there.

438
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:22,685
Are we supposed
to close her up and

439
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:23,936
put her through
another brain surgery?

440
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,037
You should've paged me.

441
00:17:25,061 --> 00:17:26,510
I did, twice.

442
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:28,012
Derek, Lori is fine.

443
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,774
Lexie took her to recovery.
Her vitals are great...

444
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:32,133
We won't know how
she is until she wakes up.

445
00:17:32,202 --> 00:17:33,812
I should've known better.
You should've known better.

446
00:17:33,836 --> 00:17:34,947
Give me the scans.
I want to know

447
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:37,211
everything that
you did in there.

448
00:17:38,324 --> 00:17:40,023
Poor woman. 50 years old,

449
00:17:40,093 --> 00:17:42,676
and she has to wear adult
diapers to go on a date.

450
00:17:42,745 --> 00:17:44,478
Kind of takes the magic out of,

451
00:17:44,547 --> 00:17:47,080
"Let me change into something
a little more comfortable."

452
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:49,233
You're terrible.

453
00:17:49,302 --> 00:17:51,469
She probably saved
herself some trouble.

454
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:54,789
By her age, all the good
ones are already snapped up.

455
00:17:54,857 --> 00:17:56,674
Tragedy, isn't it?

456
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:58,576
Mmm.

457
00:17:58,645 --> 00:18:01,612
I'm ready with this new
bladder if anybody's interested.

458
00:18:01,681 --> 00:18:03,681
Uh, yeah. Bring it
over here, Dr. Bailey.

459
00:18:04,551 --> 00:18:05,650
Dr. Avery.

460
00:18:05,718 --> 00:18:07,846
I seem to have lost track
of the other Dr. Avery.

461
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:08,902
May I scrub in with you?

462
00:18:08,971 --> 00:18:11,072
No, you may not
scrub in with me.

463
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:12,384
I gave you a job
to do, Dr. Keaton.

464
00:18:12,408 --> 00:18:13,624
But surely...

465
00:18:13,693 --> 00:18:16,577
Do you want to go to
the benefit tonight or not?

466
00:18:16,645 --> 00:18:17,878
Yes, ma'am. Of course.

467
00:18:17,947 --> 00:18:19,997
Good. You lost
him. You go find him.

468
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:25,352
Benefit, hmm? Sounds like fun.

469
00:18:25,421 --> 00:18:27,488
Fun? It's exhausting.

470
00:18:27,556 --> 00:18:29,774
Once upon a time, I
was Catherine Fox.

471
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:31,541
Ever since I've become an Avery,

472
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:34,328
every fundraiser,
gala-charity brouhaha

473
00:18:34,397 --> 00:18:36,897
that comes along, I gotta
squeeze into some pantyhose,

474
00:18:36,983 --> 00:18:39,783
get zipped into a couture
gown and represent.

475
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:41,368
And every time
you go into an OR,

476
00:18:41,437 --> 00:18:44,955
they expect you to do Harper
Avery award-winning work,

477
00:18:45,024 --> 00:18:47,307
even though I can
never win a Harper Avery.

478
00:18:47,377 --> 00:18:49,593
The name comes with
way too much pressure.

479
00:18:49,662 --> 00:18:51,962
You can crumble
under it, burn out.

480
00:18:53,233 --> 00:18:55,199
Happened to Jackson's father.

481
00:18:55,268 --> 00:18:57,034
I do not want it to
happen to Jackson.

482
00:18:57,103 --> 00:18:59,270
Yeah, it's a lot to hold up.

483
00:18:59,339 --> 00:19:00,538
Ugh!

484
00:19:00,607 --> 00:19:03,007
Don't you wish you could
just go back sometimes?

485
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:06,093
I would love to just be
Catherine Fox all over again.

486
00:19:06,161 --> 00:19:08,713
I was so much
more fun back then.

487
00:19:08,781 --> 00:19:10,364
Ah, you're still fun now.

488
00:19:11,033 --> 00:19:12,416
I am, huh?

489
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:13,950
Glad you noticed.

490
00:19:18,307 --> 00:19:19,506
You try the cafeteria, too?

491
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:22,409
Oh, jambalaya? Disgusting.
Why do they even try?

492
00:19:22,478 --> 00:19:24,010
April's got yogurt.

493
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:25,229
Ooh!

494
00:19:25,298 --> 00:19:26,864
And leftover something.

495
00:19:28,568 --> 00:19:30,885
So Lexie removed a
tumor from a woman today,

496
00:19:30,953 --> 00:19:33,237
and now Derek's all
worried that we gorked her.

497
00:19:33,306 --> 00:19:34,622
Did you?

498
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:36,273
No.

499
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:39,276
Well, I've spent the entire
morning with Owen's stupid nurse.

500
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:40,410
Owen's nurse.

501
00:19:41,981 --> 00:19:43,013
The stupid ICU nurse.

502
00:19:43,082 --> 00:19:44,159
Well, that's not what you said.

503
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,577
And you know what?
This is really good.

504
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:47,134
Kepner can cook.

505
00:19:47,202 --> 00:19:48,719
Freaking jambalaya day.

506
00:19:48,788 --> 00:19:50,671
It's like a hearty
bowl of salmonella.

507
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:53,118
Hey, how long have you been
screwing the intern with the preemie?

508
00:19:53,142 --> 00:19:54,319
What? Morgan?

509
00:19:54,343 --> 00:19:55,843
I am not.

510
00:19:55,911 --> 00:19:58,446
Uh, well, you both were in
the on-call room this morning...

511
00:19:58,514 --> 00:19:59,746
Before dawn.

512
00:19:59,815 --> 00:20:01,732
Yeah, studying.
You're feeding her.

513
00:20:01,801 --> 00:20:03,984
Alex. No. Bad dog.

514
00:20:04,053 --> 00:20:07,571
Shut up. I mean, she's my
intern and she's a patient.

515
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,917
This is gonna turn
out like Rebecca.

516
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:11,358
Oh, yeah. Smashed-up
face? That was bad.

517
00:20:11,426 --> 00:20:13,639
Yeah, she's gonna fall for you,
and then she's gonna go crazy

518
00:20:13,663 --> 00:20:14,856
and then she's gonna
pee on my couch.

519
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,013
Oh, gross.

520
00:20:16,082 --> 00:20:17,526
Go to hell, the both of you.

521
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:20,267
Okay, just keep her
off my couch, please.

522
00:20:20,336 --> 00:20:22,456
Are things with Owen any better?

523
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:24,989
Is that my turkey casserole?

524
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,323
Oh, yeah.

525
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:28,420
How do you keep the crunchy
onion things so crunchy?

526
00:20:28,444 --> 00:20:31,545
I put them in last. Come on. I
looked forward to this all day.

527
00:20:31,614 --> 00:20:32,880
Delicious.

528
00:20:32,949 --> 00:20:34,549
Stop facebooking
my mom, all right?

529
00:20:34,884 --> 00:20:36,283
Uh, I'm not.

530
00:20:36,351 --> 00:20:37,979
Really? Then how does she
know I broke up with Lexie?

531
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:41,088
Why is she here trying to hook
me up with some junior urologist?

532
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:43,741
Hey. Hey, those are mine.
They have electrolytes.

533
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:45,204
I showed her around
half the damn hospital

534
00:20:45,228 --> 00:20:46,771
before I realized I
was on a blind date.

535
00:20:46,795 --> 00:20:48,156
You told me to
unfriend her. I did.

536
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:52,550
Hi. I'm looking for Dr. Avery.

537
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:54,018
Oh, yes. He's right there. Oh.

538
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:57,187
There you are. Yeah.

539
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,722
Shall we continue?

540
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:00,056
Let's do that.

541
00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:01,725
That's great.

542
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:08,766
Cristina?

543
00:21:08,835 --> 00:21:10,746
Drop it. We were talking.

544
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,770
No, you were
talking. I said drop it.

545
00:21:14,139 --> 00:21:15,272
I'm fine.

546
00:21:16,075 --> 00:21:17,591
Everything is fine, really.

547
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:23,208
I thought we could
check out your cafeteria,

548
00:21:23,232 --> 00:21:24,543
get a bite to eat, talk.

549
00:21:24,567 --> 00:21:25,567
Listen, Dr. Keaton...

550
00:21:25,634 --> 00:21:27,167
Mara.

551
00:21:27,236 --> 00:21:30,303
Yeah, you're very nice, okay?
But I am not really interested.

552
00:21:30,373 --> 00:21:32,033
I'm not sure what you mean.

553
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:34,536
Obviously, my mom thought there
might be some kind of connection

554
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:37,861
or something
here, but I'm sorry.

555
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:39,541
I'm just not looking
for... A hookup?

556
00:21:39,565 --> 00:21:41,414
Or whatever. I see.

557
00:21:41,483 --> 00:21:44,785
You think I'm being served
to you like a concubine?

558
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:45,870
No, I didn't...

559
00:21:45,938 --> 00:21:47,332
I'm not here to
service you, Dr. Avery.

560
00:21:47,356 --> 00:21:49,534
I'm here to serve your
mother for a grade.

561
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:51,770
And she has tasked me with
digging up as much as I can

562
00:21:51,794 --> 00:21:54,039
about your boards, your
standing, your love life,

563
00:21:54,063 --> 00:21:55,624
and when you're gonna stop
screwing around in plastics.

564
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:57,130
You're not a
setup. You're a spy.

565
00:21:57,199 --> 00:21:59,043
I rank this task slightly above
wiping vomit from bedpans,

566
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:00,779
but your mother is a
very demanding woman,

567
00:22:00,803 --> 00:22:02,213
and if you know
anything about her,

568
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:04,277
you know I can't go
back empty-handed.

569
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:07,252
So if you're really sorry and
not just a presumptuous pig,

570
00:22:07,276 --> 00:22:09,176
you would do a girl a solid,

571
00:22:09,245 --> 00:22:11,356
and you will tell me whatever
it is you want me to tell her.

572
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:14,364
And you can do it in the cafeteria,
because I'm bloody starving!

573
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:15,866
Not a chance.

574
00:22:15,935 --> 00:22:17,334
It's jambalaya day.

575
00:22:19,488 --> 00:22:20,671
Come with me.

576
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:23,723
Where is Lexie?

577
00:22:23,793 --> 00:22:26,660
I told her to go wait for the
labs. It's going to be fine.

578
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:30,197
Oh, God, honey.

579
00:22:30,266 --> 00:22:31,310
We're Lori's parents.

580
00:22:31,334 --> 00:22:32,866
We were in Rome.
We just got here.

581
00:22:32,935 --> 00:22:34,646
I'm Dr. Shepherd.
This is Dr. Grey.

582
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:36,269
How is she?

583
00:22:36,338 --> 00:22:38,600
Lori's surgery went very
well. Her vitals are excellent.

584
00:22:38,624 --> 00:22:41,142
We won't know more until she
comes out of the anesthesia.

585
00:22:42,377 --> 00:22:43,705
She's starting to come around.

586
00:22:43,729 --> 00:22:45,079
Hey, Lori. How are you doing?

587
00:22:46,432 --> 00:22:47,898
Let me look at you, okay?

588
00:22:47,966 --> 00:22:50,434
Well, responses are
good. Follow this for me. Up.

589
00:22:50,936 --> 00:22:52,236
Down.

590
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:53,320
How you feeling?

591
00:22:53,389 --> 00:22:54,921
Honey, we're right here.

592
00:22:56,075 --> 00:22:57,341
Hi.

593
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:59,043
That's a good sign.

594
00:22:59,111 --> 00:23:00,761
Hi, sweetheart.

595
00:23:25,137 --> 00:23:26,670
It's called aphasia.

596
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:29,389
The part of the brain that helps
control how she forms words

597
00:23:29,458 --> 00:23:31,075
was damaged in the surgery.

598
00:23:31,143 --> 00:23:33,343
There is a chance, with therapy,

599
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:35,212
that she will regain
some of her function.

600
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,480
Some?

601
00:23:36,548 --> 00:23:37,609
What the hell did you do to her?

602
00:23:37,633 --> 00:23:39,553
Mr. Bosson... I am sorry. I...

603
00:23:40,803 --> 00:23:42,819
I had the best intentions.

604
00:23:42,888 --> 00:23:45,922
It was an outcome
that I did not foresee.

605
00:23:45,991 --> 00:23:47,268
I'm sorry. I made a mistake.

606
00:23:47,292 --> 00:23:48,609
We're suing you.

607
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:51,328
She's 27 years old.
You ruined her life.

608
00:23:51,397 --> 00:23:53,025
We are going to sue
you. Honey, honey...

609
00:23:53,049 --> 00:23:54,882
Honey, stop. Lori can hear you.

610
00:23:58,271 --> 00:24:00,082
It was my mistake. You
weren't even in the room.

611
00:24:00,106 --> 00:24:02,673
My mistake was leaving
you two in there alone.

612
00:24:02,742 --> 00:24:03,919
I can't believe
you would do this.

613
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:05,204
I thought, if you
had seen the tumor...

614
00:24:05,228 --> 00:24:07,043
You didn't think at all.

615
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:09,729
Okay, it's my fault.
Let's just let it be my fault.

616
00:24:09,798 --> 00:24:12,382
This will kill Lexie. It'll
destroy her confidence.

617
00:24:12,434 --> 00:24:14,095
Does she even have to
know? Of course she does.

618
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:15,302
She's not strong enough.

619
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:17,490
Then she shouldn't be a surgeon.

620
00:24:19,909 --> 00:24:21,841
Hey, did she wake up yet?

621
00:24:22,912 --> 00:24:25,478
I am telling you,
Dr. Webber was amazing.

622
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:27,987
He cradled your bladder
in those big old hands

623
00:24:28,017 --> 00:24:29,645
like it was his own little baby.

624
00:24:29,669 --> 00:24:31,368
Oh, my God. Stop it.

625
00:24:31,436 --> 00:24:34,121
And I said to him, I said,
"You got a fat, ugly baby."

626
00:24:34,856 --> 00:24:36,090
Stop. I'm gonna pee.

627
00:24:37,593 --> 00:24:38,692
Wait.

628
00:24:39,327 --> 00:24:40,460
I'm not gonna pee?

629
00:24:40,529 --> 00:24:42,863
No, baby. You are
not going to pee.

630
00:24:42,932 --> 00:24:44,548
I'm not gonna pee!

631
00:24:44,617 --> 00:24:45,900
Okay.

632
00:24:46,535 --> 00:24:47,634
Wait, wait, wait.

633
00:24:48,371 --> 00:24:50,187
Here we go. Okay.

634
00:24:50,255 --> 00:24:52,306
Satisfied customer.

635
00:24:52,375 --> 00:24:54,408
Ah. We are quite
a team, aren't we?

636
00:24:55,544 --> 00:24:57,010
Hey.

637
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:59,880
You know what would
make this thing fun tonight?

638
00:24:59,948 --> 00:25:02,149
If you came with me.

639
00:25:02,217 --> 00:25:05,736
I've got Jackson coming, but
I'd much prefer a grown-up along.

640
00:25:05,805 --> 00:25:07,621
I wish I could.

641
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:09,507
I mean, I really do, but...

642
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:15,579
You know what?

643
00:25:15,648 --> 00:25:17,363
I'd be honored to join you.

644
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:18,699
Yes. Okay.

645
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:20,000
Can you get a tux?

646
00:25:20,069 --> 00:25:21,267
Sure.

647
00:25:22,755 --> 00:25:25,539
This is gonna be so much fun.

648
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:29,359
You have to stop thinking of
this as giving up on Michael

649
00:25:29,428 --> 00:25:31,595
and try to see it
as helping him.

650
00:25:31,664 --> 00:25:32,813
Emily.

651
00:25:36,602 --> 00:25:38,285
It's a hard step.

652
00:25:38,354 --> 00:25:41,972
But it is his next step, and
he really needs you right now.

653
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:43,923
How can I do this when
he said not to do it?

654
00:25:43,992 --> 00:25:45,475
How?

655
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:47,984
It would've been better
if he died in the crash.

656
00:25:48,447 --> 00:25:50,214
He'd be just as dead,

657
00:25:50,282 --> 00:25:52,722
but you wouldn't
be feeling like this.

658
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:54,985
This way,

659
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:57,303
he's died in slow motion.

660
00:25:57,372 --> 00:26:00,641
On Monday, his heart
ruptured, and I repaired it.

661
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:03,376
But on Tuesday,
his lungs collapsed.

662
00:26:03,462 --> 00:26:05,573
By Thursday, his kidneys failed,

663
00:26:05,597 --> 00:26:09,333
and the sepsis and infection took
three more days to kill his brain.

664
00:26:09,735 --> 00:26:11,435
Sam...

665
00:26:11,503 --> 00:26:14,921
If he had died in the crash
by the side of the road,

666
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:19,292
if you had seen him zipped
up in a bag and driven off,

667
00:26:19,361 --> 00:26:23,396
he would be every bit as
gone as he is right now,

668
00:26:23,465 --> 00:26:24,915
but you would know it.

669
00:26:26,469 --> 00:26:28,829
And you could take
some comfort in that.

670
00:26:30,172 --> 00:26:31,872
I didn't know him. You did.

671
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:34,903
But I would imagine
he would have

672
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:37,208
wanted you to have that comfort.

673
00:26:42,902 --> 00:26:44,368
Bring me the papers.

674
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,273
You're an Oxford-educated
surgeon. Come on.

675
00:26:50,342 --> 00:26:52,175
Yeah, I know! It's insulting.

676
00:26:52,244 --> 00:26:54,923
You think I like snooping
around after her slacker son?

677
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:56,547
Watch it.

678
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:58,393
The woman has no
sense of boundaries.

679
00:26:58,417 --> 00:26:59,583
Yeah, she does.

680
00:26:59,652 --> 00:27:01,412
She just hates boundaries
so she ignores them.

681
00:27:01,436 --> 00:27:04,004
You gotta set boundaries
with her. You gotta tell her no.

682
00:27:04,073 --> 00:27:05,801
No. Have you met her?

683
00:27:05,825 --> 00:27:07,223
She'll fire me.

684
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:08,703
No, actually,
she'll respect you.

685
00:27:08,727 --> 00:27:09,943
You gotta tell her no,

686
00:27:10,011 --> 00:27:11,155
and then when she gives
you those big, sad eyes...

687
00:27:11,179 --> 00:27:12,674
No, she doesn't make
those eyes at me.

688
00:27:12,698 --> 00:27:14,276
When she glares at you with
disgust and disappointment...

689
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,820
Bingo. That's when
you stick to your guns.

690
00:27:18,671 --> 00:27:20,069
I don't have guns.

691
00:27:21,323 --> 00:27:22,939
I'm unarmed.

692
00:27:23,009 --> 00:27:24,941
You are not unarmed.

693
00:27:25,011 --> 00:27:26,091
You have guns. I can tell.

694
00:27:29,298 --> 00:27:34,985
When we took out the tumor,
we damaged Broca's area.

695
00:27:35,054 --> 00:27:38,722
So she can understand speech
and she knows what she wants to say,

696
00:27:38,791 --> 00:27:40,390
but she can't say it.

697
00:27:40,458 --> 00:27:43,477
Okay, well, just tell
me that he can fix it.

698
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:47,259
He can't. It's irreparable.

699
00:27:47,283 --> 00:27:49,133
What do you mean? I mean...

700
00:27:49,201 --> 00:27:50,921
She's not gonna be able to talk?

701
00:27:50,953 --> 00:27:52,919
She's 27. She...

702
00:27:52,988 --> 00:27:55,722
He has to fix it. I mean,
there has to be something.

703
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:57,357
There isn't.

704
00:27:57,426 --> 00:27:59,471
I mean, this is my fault, too.
I shouldn't have let you do it.

705
00:27:59,495 --> 00:28:00,627
Oh, God.

706
00:28:01,897 --> 00:28:03,563
Oh, my God. She...

707
00:28:05,467 --> 00:28:06,683
It was right there.

708
00:28:06,752 --> 00:28:09,119
And I mean, I never
would've done it if...

709
00:28:09,188 --> 00:28:10,887
You saw it. I mean...

710
00:28:10,956 --> 00:28:13,234
I know. I know. You're
not gonna cry right now.

711
00:28:13,258 --> 00:28:14,970
You're gonna go
and talk to Derek.

712
00:28:14,994 --> 00:28:17,594
And he is gonna be
pissed and disappointed

713
00:28:17,663 --> 00:28:20,208
and he's gonna scream at you
and he won't look at you for days.

714
00:28:20,232 --> 00:28:21,531
Just take it.

715
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,678
And you'll move on
and you'll learn from this

716
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:25,862
and you will never
make this mistake again.

717
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:30,874
Yeah, his heart's good.
Ventric's draining well.

718
00:28:30,943 --> 00:28:33,143
And you got 2-for-1 surgeries.

719
00:28:33,178 --> 00:28:35,078
Your son's a gold mine.

720
00:28:35,147 --> 00:28:37,764
We're lucky to have
you as his doctor.

721
00:28:37,833 --> 00:28:40,367
Since you're about to fail
your boards and work at a bar.

722
00:28:40,436 --> 00:28:41,684
Stop saying that.

723
00:28:41,753 --> 00:28:43,003
I'm gonna go see my boy.

724
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,906
You and Morgan a thing?

725
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:49,876
No. No. Her dumbass
boyfriend bailed.

726
00:28:49,944 --> 00:28:51,289
She just needs someone
to keep an eye on her.

727
00:28:51,313 --> 00:28:53,346
She's my intern. Right.

728
00:28:53,415 --> 00:28:54,825
You ever see one
of those gorillas

729
00:28:54,849 --> 00:28:56,194
that likes to cuddle
the little kitten

730
00:28:56,218 --> 00:28:57,458
and raises it as its own?

731
00:28:58,537 --> 00:29:00,137
It's called imprinting.

732
00:29:00,205 --> 00:29:03,523
The scared little kitten
lets the big gorilla cuddle it

733
00:29:03,592 --> 00:29:05,725
because there's
no mama cat around

734
00:29:05,794 --> 00:29:08,428
or, you know, the dumbass
cat boyfriend left town.

735
00:29:08,497 --> 00:29:10,764
That... This isn't that.

736
00:29:11,767 --> 00:29:14,868
Watch out, 'cause she's smitten.

737
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:17,036
She is not.

738
00:29:17,105 --> 00:29:19,923
You know what? Go watch
your animal channel or whatever.

739
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:25,729
Big dumb gorilla.

740
00:29:31,987 --> 00:29:34,421
Getting all ready for your date?

741
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:37,307
It's not a date. It's a
function with a colleague.

742
00:29:37,376 --> 00:29:38,658
Mmm-hmm.

743
00:29:38,727 --> 00:29:40,193
Does she know that?

744
00:29:40,262 --> 00:29:41,511
What do you mean?

745
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:42,858
I mean, the way
you two have been

746
00:29:42,882 --> 00:29:44,442
flirting with each
other all day.

747
00:29:44,466 --> 00:29:45,715
I am not flirting.

748
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:47,328
Well, why do I feel
like I need a shower?

749
00:29:47,352 --> 00:29:49,001
Are you suggest...

750
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:52,322
Look, I am a married man
with a wife in a nursing home.

751
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:53,630
I know that.

752
00:29:55,193 --> 00:29:57,461
I am not... Oh, God.

753
00:29:57,529 --> 00:29:58,995
I love my wife, Bailey.

754
00:29:59,064 --> 00:30:01,647
Oh, Dr. Webber, I
know you love your wife.

755
00:30:01,716 --> 00:30:04,150
You're killing yourself
because you love your wife.

756
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:05,930
You're not getting any sleep,

757
00:30:05,954 --> 00:30:10,023
you're trying so hard to make
sure she knows she's loved.

758
00:30:11,326 --> 00:30:12,392
Give me that.

759
00:30:14,963 --> 00:30:18,381
You can give yourself a break.

760
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:21,129
Okay? Everybody in this
hospital flirts with everybody else.

761
00:30:21,153 --> 00:30:22,886
It's fine.

762
00:30:22,955 --> 00:30:24,237
You're a good man.

763
00:30:25,007 --> 00:30:28,124
I know it. We all know it.

764
00:30:28,193 --> 00:30:30,744
But I don't know if
Dr. Winky Pants knows it.

765
00:30:30,812 --> 00:30:32,746
Well, I'm just saying,

766
00:30:32,814 --> 00:30:36,316
there's flirting for fun and
then there's flirting for profit.

767
00:30:36,385 --> 00:30:38,745
I know which one you're doing.

768
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:00,707
That's everything?

769
00:31:00,776 --> 00:31:03,136
Uh, yes. It's just a
matter of time now.

770
00:31:03,863 --> 00:31:04,911
Okay.

771
00:31:05,447 --> 00:31:06,447
Uh,

772
00:31:08,317 --> 00:31:09,399
thanks.

773
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:23,730
Damn you.

774
00:31:24,566 --> 00:31:26,249
Damn you.

775
00:31:26,318 --> 00:31:30,102
This is why it took me three
years to tell you that I loved you

776
00:31:30,171 --> 00:31:32,305
and another three years
before I moved in with you.

777
00:31:32,374 --> 00:31:35,709
You thought I was
scared to commit?

778
00:31:35,777 --> 00:31:37,261
I was scared of this,

779
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,380
scared of how much I loved you,

780
00:31:41,483 --> 00:31:42,927
scared of the
feeling that I'd never

781
00:31:42,951 --> 00:31:44,617
be able to find
happiness without you.

782
00:31:44,686 --> 00:31:47,821
That's what I was scared
of. I was scared of this.

783
00:31:50,142 --> 00:31:51,475
This right here.

784
00:31:54,379 --> 00:31:55,445
Ho ho.

785
00:31:56,281 --> 00:31:57,414
Damn you.

786
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,593
Dr. Yang, can I do anything?

787
00:32:11,714 --> 00:32:13,396
Can you stop
screwing my husband?

788
00:32:18,504 --> 00:32:19,770
Oh, my God.

789
00:32:19,838 --> 00:32:21,182
I have no idea why I
am even bringing any...

790
00:32:21,206 --> 00:32:22,300
Okay, you gotta listen.
You gotta listen, please.

791
00:32:22,324 --> 00:32:23,484
Don't touch me.

792
00:32:23,508 --> 00:32:25,274
I'm not... We're...

793
00:32:27,245 --> 00:32:29,029
Dr. Hunt and I are not...

794
00:32:31,733 --> 00:32:33,633
I flirt with him.

795
00:32:33,702 --> 00:32:36,113
I do. I'm a flirt. It's just how
I get through a long shift.

796
00:32:36,137 --> 00:32:39,272
But I flirt with
everyone, and I swear

797
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:41,608
it does not mean anything,
and we have never done...

798
00:32:41,677 --> 00:32:42,917
You switched to nights.

799
00:32:42,977 --> 00:32:45,078
Well, I switched to nights
because my boyfriend...

800
00:32:45,146 --> 00:32:46,612
I have a boyfriend. Here.

801
00:32:46,681 --> 00:32:48,631
Here. Call him. He'll tell you.

802
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:49,811
And do you want to look through
my text messages? You can...

803
00:32:49,835 --> 00:32:52,219
Stop. Just stop.

804
00:32:52,287 --> 00:32:54,421
Dr. Yang, I am so
sorry. He's just...

805
00:32:55,573 --> 00:32:57,590
He's the chief. I would never...

806
00:32:58,893 --> 00:33:00,143
I swear.

807
00:33:06,518 --> 00:33:07,684
I'm sorry.

808
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:10,981
You stick to your surgical plan.

809
00:33:11,005 --> 00:33:12,717
You find a tumor,
you find anything...

810
00:33:12,741 --> 00:33:14,908
You close up, and you
make a plan for that.

811
00:33:14,976 --> 00:33:16,053
I know. I know that.

812
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:17,310
Do you?

813
00:33:17,379 --> 00:33:19,419
Do you? Because if you
had taken the time to look,

814
00:33:19,448 --> 00:33:21,192
you would have opted to
approach the tumor from this angle...

815
00:33:21,216 --> 00:33:23,261
And Lori would be
speaking right now!

816
00:33:23,285 --> 00:33:26,186
It's just stupid, a
stupid, arrogant mistake.

817
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:28,454
You stick to your surgical plan.

818
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:29,850
You make an
incidental finding...

819
00:33:35,313 --> 00:33:37,347
Don't you look fine?

820
00:33:38,217 --> 00:33:39,465
Ah!

821
00:33:39,534 --> 00:33:41,434
Mom, Mara has something to say.

822
00:33:42,221 --> 00:33:44,855
I... I don't really.

823
00:33:44,923 --> 00:33:46,105
Sure you do.

824
00:33:48,143 --> 00:33:51,845
Dr. Avery and I have decided
we won't be joining you tonight.

825
00:33:52,581 --> 00:33:54,414
Oh?

826
00:33:54,483 --> 00:33:56,816
Unless, of course, you
really want me to, and...

827
00:33:56,885 --> 00:33:57,934
Guns.

828
00:34:02,173 --> 00:34:03,651
Since you brought
me across the country

829
00:34:03,675 --> 00:34:05,659
to run a personal errand for you

830
00:34:05,727 --> 00:34:08,089
when I could've been gaining
valuable surgical experience...

831
00:34:08,113 --> 00:34:09,290
There you go.

832
00:34:09,314 --> 00:34:10,892
I've decided to
take the night off.

833
00:34:10,916 --> 00:34:12,432
I'm going to do
what I want to do

834
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,000
with my time and you can just...

835
00:34:14,069 --> 00:34:16,619
You want to stop right there.

836
00:34:16,688 --> 00:34:17,749
Yeah, you're done.

837
00:34:17,773 --> 00:34:19,655
So you captured my spy.

838
00:34:19,725 --> 00:34:22,703
She will be very well
treated. Now you have fun.

839
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:24,967
Okay? Fly safe. I love you.

840
00:34:27,348 --> 00:34:28,882
Doctor. Doctor.

841
00:34:29,718 --> 00:34:31,084
Doctor.

842
00:34:34,422 --> 00:34:36,455
I was gonna uninvite
you all anyway.

843
00:34:37,192 --> 00:34:38,391
I have a date.

844
00:34:39,894 --> 00:34:41,428
Rough day, big guy...

845
00:34:42,397 --> 00:34:45,498
Pericardial tumor
and a grade-3 bleed.

846
00:34:45,567 --> 00:34:47,367
But you're still kicking.

847
00:34:47,436 --> 00:34:49,030
Hey, you about ready to go?

848
00:34:49,054 --> 00:34:50,453
Uh, almost.

849
00:34:50,522 --> 00:34:52,367
Uh, hey. Can you take
another picture of us?

850
00:34:52,391 --> 00:34:54,135
You know, just for
me to have tonight.

851
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:55,279
Of course.

852
00:34:56,211 --> 00:34:57,977
Alex. Get in here.

853
00:34:58,046 --> 00:34:59,512
No, that's cool. It's...

854
00:34:59,581 --> 00:35:01,214
Get... Get over here.

855
00:35:06,471 --> 00:35:09,505
Okay. One. Two. Three.

856
00:35:10,325 --> 00:35:11,565
All right.

857
00:35:12,093 --> 00:35:13,192
Hey.

858
00:35:15,247 --> 00:35:16,512
Ah.

859
00:35:16,581 --> 00:35:19,021
She's a smitten kitten.

860
00:35:31,062 --> 00:35:32,579
You look lovely.

861
00:35:32,648 --> 00:35:34,808
I thought you were
gonna stand me up.

862
00:35:35,534 --> 00:35:39,235
Well, I'm afraid I am.

863
00:35:39,287 --> 00:35:41,154
I'm sorry,
Catherine. I can't go.

864
00:35:41,223 --> 00:35:43,167
Is this because I've been
flirting with you all day?

865
00:35:43,191 --> 00:35:44,958
No. No.

866
00:35:45,043 --> 00:35:47,922
Come on, Richard. You
know I'm just having fun.

867
00:35:47,946 --> 00:35:49,946
Your wife has
nothing to worry about.

868
00:35:54,469 --> 00:35:56,703
My wife has Alzheimer's.

869
00:35:58,740 --> 00:35:59,855
How bad?

870
00:36:00,708 --> 00:36:01,975
It's bad.

871
00:36:02,978 --> 00:36:04,644
She's in a care facility.

872
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,213
I go see her every night.

873
00:36:08,383 --> 00:36:11,568
She usually doesn't
know who I am.

874
00:36:11,636 --> 00:36:14,353
She knows I'm a friend, but...

875
00:36:15,557 --> 00:36:17,674
She's not there.

876
00:36:17,743 --> 00:36:21,878
And I miss her. I miss
laughing and talking.

877
00:36:24,316 --> 00:36:26,298
I miss feeling like a man,

878
00:36:26,367 --> 00:36:28,901
not just a friend.

879
00:36:28,970 --> 00:36:31,855
Anyway, today, I wasn't lonely.

880
00:36:32,724 --> 00:36:34,691
Today I felt like a man.

881
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,092
And it felt good.

882
00:36:36,795 --> 00:36:38,210
So...

883
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:41,230
I don't trust myself going
to dinner with you tonight.

884
00:36:43,685 --> 00:36:45,551
And my wife needs me.

885
00:36:47,322 --> 00:36:49,155
And I need to see my wife.

886
00:36:50,074 --> 00:36:51,641
Richard,

887
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:53,175
you are

888
00:36:54,178 --> 00:36:55,361
a good man.

889
00:36:56,231 --> 00:36:57,431
You know that?

890
00:36:57,833 --> 00:36:59,098
I'm trying.

891
00:37:06,959 --> 00:37:08,091
Thank you

892
00:37:09,394 --> 00:37:10,593
for a lovely day.

893
00:37:25,927 --> 00:37:27,772
You sure you want to change?

894
00:37:27,796 --> 00:37:30,229
We could go somewhere nice,

895
00:37:30,298 --> 00:37:32,579
somewhere where you
could look that amazing.

896
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:35,585
Actually,

897
00:37:37,021 --> 00:37:38,421
I'm really not that hungry.

898
00:37:39,408 --> 00:37:40,507
No?

899
00:37:57,892 --> 00:37:59,693
Could you help
me with my zipper?

900
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:09,118
Can you help me
a little bit more?

901
00:38:12,291 --> 00:38:15,792
<i>Our intentions are always pure.</i>

902
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:18,295
<i>We always want
to do what's right.</i>

903
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,801
<i>But we also have the
drive to push boundaries.</i>

904
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:35,395
<i>So we're in danger
of taking things too far.</i>

905
00:38:37,399 --> 00:38:40,166
<i>We're told to "Do no harm"</i>

906
00:38:40,235 --> 00:38:43,403
<i>while we're trained to
cut you open with a knife.</i>

907
00:38:48,009 --> 00:38:49,742
Are you okay?

908
00:38:49,811 --> 00:38:51,544
No.

909
00:38:51,613 --> 00:38:53,746
Are you thinking about Lori?

910
00:38:56,301 --> 00:38:58,513
This is why I can't
come back to neuro.

911
00:38:58,537 --> 00:38:59,886
You can't even look at me.

912
00:39:01,006 --> 00:39:02,338
It's no good for us.

913
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:03,889
I know.

914
00:39:09,898 --> 00:39:11,463
You want to talk about it?

915
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,783
No.

916
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:15,701
Do you want to
take your mind off it?

917
00:39:16,688 --> 00:39:18,003
No.

918
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:21,980
Do you want me
to leave you alone?

919
00:39:24,228 --> 00:39:25,261
No.

920
00:39:29,984 --> 00:39:32,785
<i>So, we do things</i>

921
00:39:36,307 --> 00:39:39,125
<i>when we should have
left well enough alone.</i>

922
00:39:45,166 --> 00:39:48,183
<i>Because it's hard to admit
when there's no problem to treat.</i>

923
00:39:48,253 --> 00:39:49,919
Hey. You're awake.

924
00:39:50,938 --> 00:39:52,305
You didn't come home.

925
00:39:53,241 --> 00:39:54,740
Yeah, there was a...

926
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:57,059
A bus crash or a train
crash or a patient crashed?

927
00:39:57,929 --> 00:39:59,495
Yeah. Right.

928
00:40:01,949 --> 00:40:03,783
<i>To let it alone.</i>

929
00:40:03,852 --> 00:40:05,284
Why are you staring at me?

930
00:40:05,353 --> 00:40:06,597
Well, I'm weighing
how upset you are

931
00:40:06,621 --> 00:40:07,848
and if I want to get into this.

932
00:40:07,872 --> 00:40:09,149
You do. You want
to get into this...

933
00:40:09,173 --> 00:40:10,568
I'm tired and
it's late. With me.

934
00:40:10,592 --> 00:40:12,169
You know what? That's the point.

935
00:40:12,193 --> 00:40:13,788
It's always late,
and it shouldn't be.

936
00:40:13,812 --> 00:40:16,512
And you should want to get
into it with me but you don't.

937
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:18,430
I mean, where are you?

938
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:21,584
I am here. For God sake. I'm
right freaking here. I'm home.

939
00:40:23,271 --> 00:40:24,687
No, you're not.

940
00:40:27,592 --> 00:40:30,059
<i>Before we make it so much worse.</i>

941
00:40:31,496 --> 00:40:35,765
<i>Before we cause
such terrible damage.</i>

942
00:40:35,834 --> 00:40:39,368
You have to be honest with me
because I am going crazy here.

943
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,704
Do you love me anymore?

944
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:42,972
It's not about if I...

945
00:40:43,041 --> 00:40:44,485
Owen, please
answer the question.

946
00:40:44,509 --> 00:40:46,509
I love you so
much that it hurts.

947
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:50,129
Okay.

948
00:40:50,932 --> 00:40:53,132
Well, okay, then.

949
00:40:53,201 --> 00:40:56,169
Then we can work
on this. We can talk.

950
00:40:56,237 --> 00:40:58,137
You know, we have to talk,

951
00:40:58,206 --> 00:41:00,200
because I cannot
be like this anymore.

952
00:41:00,224 --> 00:41:03,224
And I mean it when I say
that I'm going crazy, 'cause...

953
00:41:05,329 --> 00:41:07,096
'Cause that nurse Emily...

954
00:41:07,165 --> 00:41:09,543
I mean, I accused her
of sleeping with you.

955
00:41:09,567 --> 00:41:10,667
You what?

956
00:41:10,735 --> 00:41:13,887
I'm sorry. I just... I
mean, I feel like...

957
00:41:15,156 --> 00:41:17,907
My whole body feels like...

958
00:41:20,111 --> 00:41:21,922
Like you were cheating on me.

959
00:41:21,946 --> 00:41:24,258
And then you come home and
you tell me that you love me,

960
00:41:24,282 --> 00:41:26,649
and I'm relieved.

961
00:41:26,718 --> 00:41:27,978
I mean, I'm so
relieved because...

962
00:41:28,002 --> 00:41:29,368
Stop. Stop.

963
00:41:32,724 --> 00:41:34,924
I said I love you so
much that it hurts.

964
00:41:37,395 --> 00:41:38,828
Okay.

965
00:41:38,897 --> 00:41:39,979
I said

966
00:41:41,249 --> 00:41:42,448
it hurts

967
00:41:43,551 --> 00:41:44,650
to love you.

968
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:51,924
Just say it.

969
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,167
I'm not cheating
on you with Emily.

970
00:42:03,087 --> 00:42:04,253
Okay.

971
00:42:07,275 --> 00:42:08,674
But I did cheat on you.
