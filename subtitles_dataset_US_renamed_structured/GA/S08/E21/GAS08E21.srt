1
00:00:01,969 --> 00:00:03,402
<i>Picture this.</i>

2
00:00:03,471 --> 00:00:05,671
<i>You've spent the past
five years of your residency</i>

3
00:00:05,706 --> 00:00:07,306
<i>training to become a surgeon,</i>

4
00:00:07,375 --> 00:00:09,608
<i>but those five years
suddenly don't matter.</i>

5
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:11,776
<i>The only thing that matters,</i>

6
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:15,063
<i>the only thing between you and
the rest of your career is a test</i>

7
00:00:15,132 --> 00:00:17,416
<i>in a random hotel
in a random city</i>

8
00:00:17,484 --> 00:00:21,453
<i>with a random examiner
asking you random questions.</i>

9
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:24,322
<i>Nervous? You should be.</i>

10
00:00:24,392 --> 00:00:26,102
We should be gone by now.

11
00:00:26,126 --> 00:00:27,838
The flight's not for
three hours. You're fine.

12
00:00:27,862 --> 00:00:29,740
I'd be fine if people
showed up on time.

13
00:00:29,764 --> 00:00:31,162
No one is going to be late.

14
00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:33,064
San Francisco is
a short flight away.

15
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:35,133
There's no reason
to be nervous, okay?

16
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:37,970
Not again.

17
00:00:39,123 --> 00:00:40,455
I'm sorry.

18
00:00:40,524 --> 00:00:42,519
It's just that my parents
called me this morning

19
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:43,942
to wish me luck,

20
00:00:44,011 --> 00:00:46,022
and they told me that their
church is praying for me,

21
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:48,091
and what if I don't pass?

22
00:00:48,115 --> 00:00:50,498
One in five people don't pass.

23
00:00:50,567 --> 00:00:52,567
Kepner, stop. You're
a trauma surgeon.

24
00:00:52,636 --> 00:00:54,119
We're soldiers.

25
00:00:54,188 --> 00:00:56,469
We fight battles harder
than this test every single day,

26
00:00:56,506 --> 00:00:57,789
and we win, okay?

27
00:00:57,858 --> 00:01:00,242
So, dry your tears.

28
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:03,178
I want you to repeat after me.

29
00:01:03,246 --> 00:01:05,064
I am a soldier. I'm a soldier.

30
00:01:05,132 --> 00:01:07,382
No, no. I want to
hear you mean it.

31
00:01:07,451 --> 00:01:09,150
Repeat. I am a soldier.

32
00:01:09,219 --> 00:01:10,259
I am a soldier.

33
00:01:10,286 --> 00:01:12,215
Now get on the bus. Okay.

34
00:01:14,424 --> 00:01:16,124
Karev?

35
00:01:16,193 --> 00:01:18,204
Now, have salmon for dinner.

36
00:01:18,228 --> 00:01:20,373
And tell room service to
make sure it's not frozen.

37
00:01:20,397 --> 00:01:22,776
You lose omega-3s
if it's frozen.

38
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,444
Avery, are you listening to me?

39
00:01:24,468 --> 00:01:25,468
I'm trying not to.

40
00:01:25,536 --> 00:01:26,780
All right, how are you on cash?

41
00:01:26,804 --> 00:01:28,047
I figured you needed some.

42
00:01:28,071 --> 00:01:29,483
Okay, don't overthink it.

43
00:01:29,507 --> 00:01:31,217
They want standard
protocol, not cutting edge.

44
00:01:31,241 --> 00:01:32,919
This is a test in proficiency,

45
00:01:32,943 --> 00:01:34,521
and you're proficient
in your sleep.

46
00:01:34,545 --> 00:01:36,089
So just make sure that
you get a lot of sleep.

47
00:01:36,113 --> 00:01:38,224
You want me to be
relaxed, right? Exactly.

48
00:01:38,248 --> 00:01:39,981
This isn't helping.

49
00:01:41,051 --> 00:01:42,094
You're right. WOMAN: Bye!

50
00:01:42,118 --> 00:01:43,398
Go! MAN: Bye.

51
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:51,410
Kick ass.

52
00:01:55,699 --> 00:01:56,939
It's exciting, huh?

53
00:01:57,001 --> 00:01:59,101
They started off
with so little promise,

54
00:01:59,169 --> 00:02:00,969
I feel like I'm
witnessing a miracle.

55
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:02,304
Where the hell is Karev?

56
00:02:02,373 --> 00:02:04,806
He'll be here. I
trained him right.

57
00:02:05,876 --> 00:02:07,116
Okay.

58
00:02:08,712 --> 00:02:10,156
Coming! Don't leave without me.

59
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:11,413
Miracle.

60
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:16,484
Where is Meredith Grey?

61
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:17,914
They called 10 minutes ago.

62
00:02:17,938 --> 00:02:19,515
She started throwing up
right after I dropped her off.

63
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:21,267
She's really warm.
Maybe I should stay.

64
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:22,835
No, babies get sick. It sucks,

65
00:02:22,859 --> 00:02:24,454
but it's the disgusting
circle of life.

66
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:25,504
We have trained too hard.

67
00:02:25,528 --> 00:02:26,907
I have personally
put in hours of my life

68
00:02:26,931 --> 00:02:28,441
that I will never get
back, so you are not failing

69
00:02:28,465 --> 00:02:30,409
just because your mommy
hormones are all "code orange."

70
00:02:30,433 --> 00:02:32,317
Go to the airport.
Pass your boards.

71
00:02:32,386 --> 00:02:33,463
My baby is sick.

72
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:35,007
Lucky for her, her
father's a doctor.

73
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:36,305
Takes a village.

74
00:02:36,373 --> 00:02:37,550
And Zola's village is
chock-full of doctors.

75
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:40,058
Okay? She will be fine.
Just go. Make me proud.

76
00:02:40,127 --> 00:02:41,771
All right. Mama loves you, Zo.

77
00:02:41,795 --> 00:02:43,473
You're my Zozo. I love you.

78
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:45,813
I'll be home soon. Yeah.

79
00:02:45,882 --> 00:02:47,282
Hey, Torres, thank
you very much.

80
00:02:47,351 --> 00:02:48,828
Do you mind looking
after her for a minute?

81
00:02:48,852 --> 00:02:50,880
I gotta make some
calls. Yeah, no. No.

82
00:02:50,904 --> 00:02:52,231
Sofia had that
bug last week, so...

83
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:54,822
I'm not getting
anywhere near that.

84
00:02:54,891 --> 00:02:56,252
What happened
to "we're a village"?

85
00:02:56,276 --> 00:02:58,126
It's a metaphor,
Shepherd. Good luck.

86
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:05,995
What's the deal with
Tommy's platelet count?

87
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,263
Did you know it dropped?

88
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:09,082
He's not your patient
anymore, remember?

89
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:11,223
His crit's been decreasing,
and his SATs are low.

90
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:12,953
We might want to...
We've been getting along

91
00:03:12,977 --> 00:03:14,838
just fine without you
these past few weeks.

92
00:03:14,862 --> 00:03:16,572
I don't need you butting in now.

93
00:03:16,596 --> 00:03:18,196
Karev, outside.

94
00:03:18,265 --> 00:03:19,265
Now.

95
00:03:23,153 --> 00:03:24,214
Tommy's deteriorating.

96
00:03:24,238 --> 00:03:25,704
What did his x-rays show?

97
00:03:25,772 --> 00:03:27,172
Just... Shh.

98
00:03:27,808 --> 00:03:29,107
Okay...

99
00:03:29,176 --> 00:03:31,521
Look your examiner in
the eye, but don't stare.

100
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:33,089
And don't... And don't
rush your answers.

101
00:03:33,113 --> 00:03:35,325
It's okay to take a second
to just compose yourself.

102
00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:36,726
But don't... Don't
take too long.

103
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,295
Yeah, I got this.
Yeah, I hope you do.

104
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,652
What? I mean, I know you do.

105
00:03:44,358 --> 00:03:46,491
Twenty-three
minutes late? Not okay!

106
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,761
Is it too late to request
a van without you on it?

107
00:04:21,778 --> 00:04:23,378
I need you, Lex.

108
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:25,263
Hi. What?

109
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:27,131
I need you.

110
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,433
I'm doing a skin graft,

111
00:04:28,502 --> 00:04:30,502
and I'm stuck with an
intern who thinks that

112
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:34,689
debriding the necrotic tissue is
the title of a Nine Inch Nails album.

113
00:04:34,758 --> 00:04:36,641
Are you sure it's
not? It might be.

114
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:38,310
I'm not familiar
with their later work.

115
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:40,856
You're just sad because
Jackson is off to take his boards.

116
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,113
He and I work well together.

117
00:04:42,182 --> 00:04:44,900
We understand each other.

118
00:04:44,968 --> 00:04:47,302
Like you and I
used to, you know?

119
00:04:48,104 --> 00:04:49,104
So I need you.

120
00:04:50,473 --> 00:04:53,408
I can't. I am way behind

121
00:04:53,476 --> 00:04:56,344
on all of this
research for Shepherd.

122
00:04:56,413 --> 00:04:59,075
I was gonna pull an
all-nighter to finish, so...

123
00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:00,398
All right.

124
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:03,184
Thought it would be fun,
working together again.

125
00:05:03,253 --> 00:05:04,352
But if you're busy...

126
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:06,704
Mark, wait.

127
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:10,308
You should check out the
latest Nine Inch Nails album.

128
00:05:10,377 --> 00:05:11,909
It is pretty...

129
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:14,229
Fresh.

130
00:05:15,999 --> 00:05:17,099
Okay.

131
00:05:23,874 --> 00:05:26,274
I said "fresh."

132
00:05:26,342 --> 00:05:28,794
16-year-old male driver,
car versus streetlight.

133
00:05:28,862 --> 00:05:30,523
Arrested once before
they freed him in the car

134
00:05:30,547 --> 00:05:31,624
and once in the rig.

135
00:05:31,648 --> 00:05:33,882
BP 80 systolic, tachycardic.

136
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:36,096
Contusions and lacerations
over chest and abdomen.

137
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,630
- Where's Altman?
- Abdomen is rigid,

138
00:05:37,654 --> 00:05:39,732
so there's probably a
lot of blood in the belly.

139
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:41,656
It took over an
hour to get him out.

140
00:05:43,544 --> 00:05:44,864
Kid arrested twice in the field.

141
00:05:44,911 --> 00:05:46,911
Add an EKG to the trauma labs

142
00:05:46,963 --> 00:05:48,108
and get x-ray in here, stat.

143
00:05:48,132 --> 00:05:49,776
Right away. Oh, God. Ricky.

144
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,960
Excuse me.

145
00:05:50,984 --> 00:05:52,078
What was he even
doing in his car?

146
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:53,563
He's supposed to be
at basketball practice.

147
00:05:53,587 --> 00:05:55,614
Okay, is he allergic
to anything? No.

148
00:05:55,638 --> 00:05:56,866
Does he have heart problems? No.

149
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:58,250
Probably driving too fast.

150
00:05:58,274 --> 00:05:59,652
We swore that if he
got even one ticket,

151
00:05:59,676 --> 00:06:00,953
we would take that
car away from him.

152
00:06:00,977 --> 00:06:02,822
Hang a unit of O neg and
make sure the CT is ready.

153
00:06:02,846 --> 00:06:04,624
Rick! What is happening?
Why are they doing...

154
00:06:04,648 --> 00:06:07,888
Let's step out. Let's step
out. What's going on?

155
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,424
Oh! Sorry. Ow!

156
00:06:21,448 --> 00:06:23,615
That's... Case Western Reserve.

157
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:25,934
Do you know Ted
Stevenson, head of trauma?

158
00:06:26,002 --> 00:06:27,747
I do, yeah. He just
offered me a job.

159
00:06:27,771 --> 00:06:29,587
I might be an attending there.

160
00:06:29,656 --> 00:06:31,506
April Kepner, Seattle.

161
00:06:31,574 --> 00:06:34,320
Kevin Banks. I'm the
guy whose job you took.

162
00:06:34,344 --> 00:06:37,044
I was waiting to hear,
but I guess I just heard.

163
00:06:37,113 --> 00:06:38,379
Thanks a lot.

164
00:06:39,415 --> 00:06:40,431
He hates me.

165
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:42,912
How do you do that?

166
00:06:42,936 --> 00:06:44,447
You've been here two minutes.

167
00:06:44,471 --> 00:06:46,265
My examiner is gonna
hate me, too, instantly.

168
00:06:46,289 --> 00:06:47,638
Don't psych yourself out.

169
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:49,952
One in five people
fail the boards.

170
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:51,259
Fine. Psych yourself out.

171
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:52,972
It's just a test. We've
all dealt with worse.

172
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:55,030
No one's bleeding
out on your table.

173
00:06:55,098 --> 00:06:56,130
We will be fine.

174
00:06:58,735 --> 00:07:00,018
Cristina.

175
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:03,205
What?

176
00:07:03,273 --> 00:07:05,540
Zola has the stomach flu.

177
00:07:05,609 --> 00:07:08,142
So? Kids get sick.
Derek's with her.

178
00:07:08,211 --> 00:07:10,211
Zola has the stomach flu.

179
00:07:12,883 --> 00:07:15,349
Oh, no. No, Mer,
you can't be sick.

180
00:07:15,418 --> 00:07:17,034
You cannot be sick.

181
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:18,736
Okay.

182
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:19,845
You're just freaking out.

183
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:21,789
Okay.

184
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,903
Just take deep breaths,
okay? Just take deep breaths.

185
00:07:23,927 --> 00:07:26,861
So do you guys wanna go
register and then go get some lunch?

186
00:07:29,232 --> 00:07:30,965
What just happened?

187
00:07:32,268 --> 00:07:33,668
Stomach flu.

188
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:49,514
Zola has the stomach flu,
and you didn't say anything?

189
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:52,403
How could you? Are you
trying to sabotage us all?

190
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,050
It's not like it's
the black plague.

191
00:07:54,074 --> 00:07:55,668
You are supposed
to be our friend.

192
00:07:55,692 --> 00:07:57,291
April, calm down.

193
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,194
You stay right where
you are, Typhoid Mary.

194
00:07:59,263 --> 00:08:00,845
Come on. Let's go register.

195
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:03,582
Mer, just sit.

196
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,250
And I'll get your
registration package.

197
00:08:07,187 --> 00:08:08,719
Next in line.

198
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:10,500
Hey, Dr. Robbins, it's Alex.

199
00:08:10,524 --> 00:08:12,701
Listen, I was thinking
about Tommy.

200
00:08:12,725 --> 00:08:14,954
Have you tried
liquid ventilation?

201
00:08:14,978 --> 00:08:16,794
It's just an idea. Let me know.

202
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:20,181
Dude, is that your mom?

203
00:08:21,485 --> 00:08:23,112
Baby. Oh, no.

204
00:08:23,136 --> 00:08:24,819
I know.

205
00:08:24,887 --> 00:08:26,632
I know you don't want to see
your mother before the boards.

206
00:08:26,656 --> 00:08:28,301
But they are wearing
this old girl out.

207
00:08:28,325 --> 00:08:30,186
Got me examining
three sessions tomorrow,

208
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:31,254
and I might not see you,

209
00:08:31,278 --> 00:08:33,328
so I had to say good luck.

210
00:08:33,796 --> 00:08:35,130
Okay.

211
00:08:35,198 --> 00:08:37,048
Thank you, Mom. Oh.

212
00:08:37,117 --> 00:08:38,883
And I brought it.

213
00:08:38,952 --> 00:08:40,663
Mmm-mmm. No, no,
that's fine. You don't...

214
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:42,465
It's in here somewhere.
That's fine. That's okay.

215
00:08:42,489 --> 00:08:43,833
That's what you always say,

216
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:45,468
but you always want it
in the end. Okay, all right.

217
00:08:45,492 --> 00:08:48,059
Mom, I'm good. I am.

218
00:08:48,128 --> 00:08:50,639
I'm in room 809 when
you change your mind.

219
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:53,364
All right. All right. Excuse me.

220
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:55,962
Mommy bring you your binky?

221
00:08:55,986 --> 00:08:58,286
It's my lucky pencil. She
brought my lucky pencil.

222
00:08:58,354 --> 00:08:59,765
You know this is
an oral test, right?

223
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:01,189
Yes, I know, okay?

224
00:09:01,257 --> 00:09:03,157
It's just, I used
it for my SATs,

225
00:09:03,226 --> 00:09:05,426
and my MCATs,
and my intern exam.

226
00:09:05,495 --> 00:09:06,656
So it's your binky.

227
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,046
It's...

228
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:09,674
Sort of like my binky, yeah.

229
00:09:12,202 --> 00:09:15,386
Okay. Fill this out.

230
00:09:15,455 --> 00:09:18,017
There must be, what, like
100 people in this room?

231
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:19,540
Okay, if Kepner is right,

232
00:09:19,609 --> 00:09:21,059
20 of them are screwed.

233
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:22,254
I'm gonna puke. Relax.
You're not one of them.

234
00:09:22,278 --> 00:09:23,661
No, on you.

235
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:35,607
So, it's his bowel? Again?

236
00:09:35,675 --> 00:09:38,009
We won't know how bad it is

237
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:39,227
without opening him up.

238
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:41,445
Okay.

239
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:48,653
Morgan, we've already
removed part of his bowel.

240
00:09:48,722 --> 00:09:49,982
There's a very good
chance he won't

241
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:51,250
make it through another surgery.

242
00:09:51,274 --> 00:09:52,690
You've said that before.

243
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,476
A lot. We'll do it.

244
00:09:55,278 --> 00:09:56,427
Do the surgery.

245
00:10:00,634 --> 00:10:02,712
We can't wait for
you to prep an EVR.

246
00:10:02,736 --> 00:10:03,913
All right. Well, why
don't you open him up,

247
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:04,977
and I'll get him prepped?

248
00:10:05,038 --> 00:10:06,899
You're gonna fill him
full of blood thinners,

249
00:10:06,923 --> 00:10:08,818
his organs will bleed out before
we get a chance to save them.

250
00:10:08,842 --> 00:10:10,175
He needs damage control.

251
00:10:10,226 --> 00:10:11,937
Opening his chest will cause
more damage in the long run

252
00:10:11,961 --> 00:10:13,328
than we can control.

253
00:10:13,396 --> 00:10:16,014
She's right. This gives him
his best options for recovery.

254
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:17,965
This sounds like a
good compromise.

255
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:19,712
Dr. Hunt, sir, no one's told us

256
00:10:19,736 --> 00:10:20,963
what we're supposed
to be prepping for...

257
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:22,827
Laparotomy. EVR.

258
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:27,175
Both. Now that's a good plan.

259
00:10:29,062 --> 00:10:30,142
Both.

260
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:32,113
Prep him head to toe.

261
00:10:32,181 --> 00:10:33,815
All right then.

262
00:10:33,884 --> 00:10:36,162
Okay, page me for the tib-fib
fracture when you're done.

263
00:10:36,186 --> 00:10:37,296
Hey, where you going?

264
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,237
You want to be in the
OR with those two?

265
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:40,538
They hate each other.

266
00:10:40,606 --> 00:10:42,201
They're professionals.
They'll be fine.

267
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:43,408
No, it's awful.

268
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,288
It's tense, and it's
cold, and it's dangerous.

269
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:46,610
It feels like defusing a bomb

270
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:48,896
in a haunted house
that's built on a minefield,

271
00:10:48,965 --> 00:10:50,664
and there are bears everywhere,

272
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:52,033
and the bears have knives.

273
00:10:52,102 --> 00:10:53,629
Now I have to be
in here with them

274
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,230
for the next eight hours.

275
00:10:55,254 --> 00:10:57,856
You have to tame them, or
you will die. We will all die.

276
00:10:57,924 --> 00:10:59,218
Their hate will
destroy the hospital,

277
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:00,322
and then the whole planet.

278
00:11:00,376 --> 00:11:01,576
I am counting on you, Bailey.

279
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:03,912
We're all counting on you.

280
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:05,262
Godspeed.

281
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:16,674
Okay, 56-year-old presents
with pancreatic ductal obstruction

282
00:11:16,743 --> 00:11:19,077
and dilated main
pancreatic duct.

283
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,779
Post-op procedure... Yes.

284
00:11:21,831 --> 00:11:22,992
Dude, give it a rest.

285
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:24,410
If we don't know it by
now, we're screwed.

286
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:27,280
Besides, you've got your
magical pencil to see you through.

287
00:11:27,304 --> 00:11:28,864
He's got a magic
pencil? Oh, say more.

288
00:11:30,907 --> 00:11:31,951
His mommy brought it.

289
00:11:31,975 --> 00:11:33,775
Wait. How magical
is this pencil?

290
00:11:33,843 --> 00:11:35,743
And can it stop that?

291
00:11:36,563 --> 00:11:37,578
I'm sorry.

292
00:11:37,647 --> 00:11:39,747
I'm sorry. This all just got

293
00:11:39,816 --> 00:11:41,232
really, really real.

294
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,433
And man down.

295
00:11:42,502 --> 00:11:44,229
Two men down. First Grey, now...

296
00:11:44,253 --> 00:11:45,573
Meredith's not down. She's fine.

297
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:47,788
Shut up.

298
00:11:47,857 --> 00:11:48,968
Dr. Robbins. <i>Karev,</i>

299
00:11:48,992 --> 00:11:50,274
why do you keep calling me?

300
00:11:50,327 --> 00:11:51,804
Well, you don't answer my texts.

301
00:11:51,828 --> 00:11:53,538
I just want to know if you
got Tommy's x-rays back yet.

302
00:11:53,562 --> 00:11:55,697
Yes, and your hunch was correct.

303
00:11:55,765 --> 00:11:57,743
His necrotizing
enterocolitis has returned.

304
00:11:57,767 --> 00:12:01,019
Is Morgan... Are you
gonna operate? <i>Yeah.</i>

305
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:03,087
In a few hours. We're
prepping him soon.

306
00:12:03,155 --> 00:12:05,351
Listen, I will
text you when I...

307
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:06,441
Wait. Karev?

308
00:12:06,509 --> 00:12:07,542
I gotta go.

309
00:12:08,495 --> 00:12:09,810
Go where, to eat?

310
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:11,639
No, I gotta go back to Seattle.

311
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:15,133
What?

312
00:12:29,198 --> 00:12:31,065
Hi.

313
00:12:31,133 --> 00:12:33,078
Yeah, no, just...
Sorry, I was napping.

314
00:12:33,102 --> 00:12:36,170
I'm just... I feel
a little tired is all.

315
00:12:36,239 --> 00:12:37,438
How's Zola?

316
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:38,818
Her fever's down to
100. Stop worrying.

317
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:40,520
I can hear her screaming, Derek.

318
00:12:40,544 --> 00:12:42,855
No, no, she's screaming, "Go,
mama. Kick butt on the boards."

319
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:44,490
Is she really feeling
better? <i>Yeah, you hear that?</i>

320
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:45,646
She stopped crying.

321
00:12:46,883 --> 00:12:47,965
<i>And now she's smiling</i>

322
00:12:48,034 --> 00:12:49,367
that cute little smile she does.

323
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,013
Oh, yeah. I love that smile.

324
00:12:51,037 --> 00:12:52,782
You gonna be all right for
tomorrow? <i>Tomorrow? Yeah.</i>

325
00:12:52,806 --> 00:12:54,917
I feel great. <i>Listen,
I made some calls.</i>

326
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:57,758
There is an opening at Mass.
General, and we could do this.

327
00:12:57,827 --> 00:12:59,527
<i>And Zola could grow up</i>

328
00:12:59,596 --> 00:13:01,112
with a Boston accent.

329
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:04,432
Whoa. I don't even know if I
want the job at the Brigham.

330
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,478
And I haven't passed
my test yet. <i>You will.</i>

331
00:13:06,502 --> 00:13:07,835
Don't touch the buttons.

332
00:13:07,904 --> 00:13:09,281
<i>Zola, I'm talking to your...</i>

333
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:30,825
Nice.

334
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:32,133
I don't take chances.

335
00:13:33,696 --> 00:13:35,174
My kid just hung up on me.

336
00:13:35,198 --> 00:13:37,678
Yeah, that'll happen again.

337
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:42,102
Where did you get
an IV and fluids?

338
00:13:42,189 --> 00:13:44,338
I'm a doctor in a
hotel full of doctors.

339
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:45,789
Roll up your sleeve.

340
00:13:45,859 --> 00:13:47,125
You're a nice person.

341
00:13:47,194 --> 00:13:48,493
Don't get all misty.

342
00:13:48,562 --> 00:13:49,877
I'm outta here in 60 seconds.

343
00:13:49,946 --> 00:13:51,795
This room is like
a viral cesspool.

344
00:13:51,865 --> 00:13:54,298
Ow! I take that back.

345
00:14:00,223 --> 00:14:02,123
All right. Fluoro out.

346
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:07,511
Okay. Where were
we? Clamp, please.

347
00:14:08,698 --> 00:14:10,832
I hope that was worth it.

348
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,566
Hey, just checking
in. Almost done?

349
00:14:12,635 --> 00:14:14,913
Almost, but you
should ask Altman.

350
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:16,715
She usually disagrees with me.

351
00:14:16,739 --> 00:14:19,207
I need to check the
final position of the graft,

352
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:20,908
so, yeah, I disagree with Hunt.

353
00:14:22,077 --> 00:14:23,372
Okay, then. I don't
want to interrupt

354
00:14:23,396 --> 00:14:24,707
the work that you're doing here,

355
00:14:24,731 --> 00:14:26,509
fixing the problems
that we all want fixed,

356
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:28,232
that we all need fixed.

357
00:14:28,301 --> 00:14:29,750
So, I'll be back.

358
00:14:29,819 --> 00:14:31,218
You could stay.

359
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:32,503
There's room. Stay!

360
00:14:40,863 --> 00:14:42,024
You mind if I join you?

361
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:43,048
No. Please.

362
00:14:43,115 --> 00:14:44,977
I sent my idiot intern
to get me lunch.

363
00:14:45,001 --> 00:14:46,795
I told him to get me
anything but lentil soup.

364
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:48,046
You know what he brought me?

365
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:49,337
Lentil soup.

366
00:14:49,406 --> 00:14:50,583
The future of medicine.

367
00:14:50,607 --> 00:14:52,523
I don't know. We're
not all hopeless.

368
00:14:52,592 --> 00:14:54,120
I know. I'm spoiled with Avery.

369
00:14:54,144 --> 00:14:56,405
He's quick, he's
thorough, he's funny.

370
00:14:56,429 --> 00:14:59,263
Right, in a very dry
kind of way. Right?

371
00:14:59,316 --> 00:15:00,659
What the hell
happened to you two?

372
00:15:00,683 --> 00:15:02,550
Why'd you break up?

373
00:15:04,186 --> 00:15:05,419
Great.

374
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:07,755
It's Dumbo, the flying idiot.

375
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:09,268
I left him treating a burn.

376
00:15:09,292 --> 00:15:10,612
Now he's probably
the one on fire.

377
00:15:11,945 --> 00:15:13,127
To be continued.

378
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:14,913
Okay.

379
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:21,753
Retract more here.

380
00:15:21,821 --> 00:15:23,955
I need better visualization.

381
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:28,036
How can I help? What
the hell are you doing here?

382
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:30,489
Look, I can't just stay in that
hotel room and not do anything.

383
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:32,196
There's nothing for you to do.

384
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:33,509
Come on. I'm
here. I can scrub in.

385
00:15:33,533 --> 00:15:35,413
No, there's nothing
that I can do, Alex.

386
00:15:36,619 --> 00:15:37,718
Take a look yourself.

387
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,318
Almost the entire
bowel is necrotic.

388
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:45,070
There's nothing else to be done.

389
00:15:45,094 --> 00:15:46,227
I'm closing.

390
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:56,421
We're falling apart.

391
00:15:56,489 --> 00:15:59,089
Meredith's sick, and Alex...

392
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:01,342
What the hell was he thinking?

393
00:16:01,411 --> 00:16:02,888
See, you gotta put all
that out of your head.

394
00:16:02,912 --> 00:16:04,992
Okay? Concentrate
on your own game.

395
00:16:06,182 --> 00:16:07,281
I'm a soldier.

396
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:08,416
What?

397
00:16:08,985 --> 00:16:10,585
Nothing.

398
00:16:10,653 --> 00:16:12,030
Hey, but we're
still standing, right?

399
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:13,164
Hell, yeah, we are. Yeah.

400
00:16:13,188 --> 00:16:15,172
Me and you. Me and you.

401
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:20,027
Who is that?

402
00:16:20,095 --> 00:16:22,713
Oh. That's the guy
who thinks I stole his job.

403
00:16:22,781 --> 00:16:23,781
He hates me.

404
00:16:23,849 --> 00:16:25,483
So what? He's a douche.

405
00:16:26,269 --> 00:16:27,902
Oh. And here he comes.

406
00:16:27,971 --> 00:16:29,281
Nah, dude, just don't.

407
00:16:29,305 --> 00:16:30,466
Just sit down... No,
no, I want to apologize.

408
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,284
I was a tool this afternoon.

409
00:16:32,308 --> 00:16:33,924
No hard feelings?

410
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,393
Sure, yeah. No problem.

411
00:16:35,461 --> 00:16:37,361
No problem at all.

412
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:38,495
I'm sorry.

413
00:16:38,564 --> 00:16:40,626
You have nothing
to be sorry for.

414
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:42,895
Best man wins and
all that stuff, right?

415
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:44,251
Or woman, whatever.

416
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,481
Yeah, he's had a few
beers. You know what?

417
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:47,016
And he got bad news
today, so we'll just...

418
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,700
All I'm saying is, obviously,

419
00:16:48,724 --> 00:16:50,552
she can offer something
that I can't offer.

420
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:53,022
All right. Everybody's a
little wound up, all right?

421
00:16:53,046 --> 00:16:56,381
So big day tomorrow, maybe
you should go sleep it off.

422
00:16:56,449 --> 00:16:57,832
Are you the boyfriend?

423
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,078
You know, you should
watch out next year,

424
00:16:59,102 --> 00:17:00,534
'cause Ted Stevenson

425
00:17:00,603 --> 00:17:02,102
likes himself a redhead.

426
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:03,231
All right. Okay, Kevin.

427
00:17:03,255 --> 00:17:04,522
I think you can leave.

428
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:05,901
Or maybe you found
that out already.

429
00:17:05,925 --> 00:17:07,392
Is that how you got the job?

430
00:17:09,545 --> 00:17:10,625
Oh!

431
00:17:10,663 --> 00:17:12,145
Bitch!

432
00:17:12,214 --> 00:17:14,360
Hey, look, you need...

433
00:17:14,384 --> 00:17:15,995
Really? You want to go?

434
00:17:16,019 --> 00:17:17,918
Yeah, bitch! I want to go!

435
00:17:18,887 --> 00:17:20,127
April!

436
00:17:27,147 --> 00:17:28,474
Stop! Yeah, you
want more of this?

437
00:17:28,498 --> 00:17:29,680
'Cause I got more!

438
00:17:29,749 --> 00:17:31,126
Shut your big mouth, all right?

439
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,411
Oh, yeah, it goes with
my big brain, dumbass!

440
00:17:32,435 --> 00:17:34,280
What? That's why I
got your job next year!

441
00:17:34,304 --> 00:17:35,469
April!

442
00:17:36,473 --> 00:17:37,521
Enough!

443
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:40,636
Now if anyone is still
here in 30 seconds,

444
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,980
you're barred from
the test. Now get!

445
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:47,698
That was not our fault, okay?

446
00:17:47,767 --> 00:17:49,111
These Case Western Reserve guys,

447
00:17:49,135 --> 00:17:50,663
they started the whole...
What are you doing here?

448
00:17:50,687 --> 00:17:53,031
What am I doing here?
What are you doing here?

449
00:17:53,055 --> 00:17:54,516
We just came down here
to get something to eat...

450
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,351
No, I thought you
were here to prove

451
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:57,986
that the considerable
amount of money spent

452
00:17:58,010 --> 00:17:59,426
training you wasn't wasted,

453
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:02,380
that the dreams you
had of becoming surgeons

454
00:18:02,448 --> 00:18:04,949
won't vanish in a puff
of smoke tomorrow

455
00:18:05,018 --> 00:18:08,130
when the examiner asks you a
question and you can't answer it

456
00:18:08,154 --> 00:18:10,099
because instead of
getting a good night's sleep,

457
00:18:10,123 --> 00:18:12,523
you were engaging
in a barroom brawl.

458
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:15,187
We should probably
go. We should go.

459
00:18:15,211 --> 00:18:17,091
Good night, chief.
Okay, night, chief.

460
00:18:18,781 --> 00:18:20,147
Oh, my God.

461
00:18:20,216 --> 00:18:22,099
Good lord.

462
00:18:22,168 --> 00:18:24,168
So you... You
didn't do anything?

463
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:25,703
You just closed him back up?

464
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:28,083
There was too much necrosis.

465
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,269
He's not going to survive.

466
00:18:30,293 --> 00:18:31,825
So we'll keep the
pressors going,

467
00:18:31,894 --> 00:18:33,444
keep him on TPN
until he's ready.

468
00:18:33,513 --> 00:18:34,923
There's got to be
more that we can do.

469
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:36,213
Morgan...

470
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,116
We did it.

471
00:18:39,468 --> 00:18:41,619
You did it. You did it all.

472
00:18:53,366 --> 00:18:54,698
I'm sorry.

473
00:18:55,568 --> 00:18:56,700
I really am.

474
00:19:13,502 --> 00:19:15,264
All right. I am
almost finished here.

475
00:19:15,288 --> 00:19:17,032
I think this boy is gonna
have to lose his spleen.

476
00:19:17,056 --> 00:19:19,451
You see any way of salvaging it?

477
00:19:20,676 --> 00:19:22,759
What... BP's crashing?
What... What happened?

478
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:24,862
There's a leak.
The graft is leaking.

479
00:19:24,931 --> 00:19:25,931
Fluoro in.

480
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:31,952
I knew it.

481
00:19:32,021 --> 00:19:33,988
What... What did you
know, that grafts leak?

482
00:19:34,057 --> 00:19:35,206
It's common. It happens.

483
00:19:35,275 --> 00:19:36,556
Fix it and then get out.

484
00:19:36,626 --> 00:19:38,358
What do you think
that I am trying to do?

485
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:40,977
All right, the leak is
below the diaphragm.

486
00:19:41,046 --> 00:19:43,047
I can try and
fix the graft by...

487
00:19:43,116 --> 00:19:45,677
Here. The abdomen's already
open. We can try to fix it manually.

488
00:19:45,701 --> 00:19:46,862
Fine. TEDDY: Try it.

489
00:19:46,886 --> 00:19:49,554
Fluoro out.

490
00:19:49,622 --> 00:19:51,988
I'm having trouble
visualizing with all this blood.

491
00:19:52,057 --> 00:19:53,402
Hunt, a little help, please.

492
00:19:53,426 --> 00:19:55,742
No, Altman can assist.

493
00:19:55,811 --> 00:19:57,388
Altman? My head's
not in the game.

494
00:19:57,412 --> 00:19:58,556
I shouldn't be here.

495
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:01,916
So, if you've got this,
I will leave you to it.

496
00:20:10,576 --> 00:20:11,576
Catherine?

497
00:20:12,261 --> 00:20:13,560
Richard?

498
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:14,912
You're an examiner?

499
00:20:14,981 --> 00:20:16,301
Either that or I'm stalking you.

500
00:20:16,332 --> 00:20:18,344
That's a win-win
if I ever heard it.

501
00:20:18,368 --> 00:20:19,528
Give me a hug.

502
00:20:23,338 --> 00:20:24,449
I didn't know you'd be here.

503
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:25,956
Every year.

504
00:20:26,025 --> 00:20:27,745
Making the future of
medicine wet its pants.

505
00:20:28,678 --> 00:20:29,918
What are you doing here?

506
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:32,379
Archie Katz, he came
down with the stomach flu,

507
00:20:32,448 --> 00:20:33,842
and they asked me to sub in.

508
00:20:33,866 --> 00:20:35,766
I figured I'd spend
the entire day

509
00:20:35,834 --> 00:20:38,452
staring at sweaty,
anxious residents.

510
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:40,738
This is a real improvement.

511
00:20:40,806 --> 00:20:42,172
I should hope so.

512
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:48,162
Coming.

513
00:20:48,231 --> 00:20:49,441
No, don't open the door.

514
00:20:49,465 --> 00:20:51,565
I don't want to
breathe your air.

515
00:20:51,633 --> 00:20:52,694
I just want to know
if you need anything.

516
00:20:52,718 --> 00:20:53,812
Oh, no. I'm okay.

517
00:20:53,836 --> 00:20:55,453
Did you sleep?

518
00:20:55,521 --> 00:20:57,182
No, it's worse
when I lie down or...

519
00:20:57,206 --> 00:20:58,286
Whoa. Uh...

520
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:01,475
When I stand up, apparently.

521
00:21:09,618 --> 00:21:10,618
Oh.

522
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,330
Do you think Zola's
gonna hate me?

523
00:21:17,059 --> 00:21:18,525
Why?

524
00:21:18,594 --> 00:21:20,622
Because moms should be
with their kids when they're sick.

525
00:21:20,646 --> 00:21:23,592
All you want to do is lay on top
of your mom when you're sick.

526
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:26,317
My mother was never
around to lay on top of,

527
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:29,520
and now I'm not there
for Zola to lay on top of.

528
00:21:29,589 --> 00:21:32,490
I was just wondering if you
think she's gonna hate me.

529
00:21:37,263 --> 00:21:39,263
Owen slept with someone.

530
00:21:40,433 --> 00:21:41,673
Yeah.

531
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:44,702
Did you know?

532
00:21:44,771 --> 00:21:46,036
Yeah.

533
00:21:46,105 --> 00:21:48,088
Does everyone know? No.

534
00:21:48,157 --> 00:21:49,968
He thought you told me,

535
00:21:49,992 --> 00:21:52,026
so he told me.

536
00:21:52,094 --> 00:21:54,128
Anyway, that's how I know.

537
00:21:57,233 --> 00:21:58,332
Okay.

538
00:21:58,401 --> 00:22:00,867
He's a pig, and
you deserve better.

539
00:22:06,109 --> 00:22:07,141
Are you still there?

540
00:22:09,345 --> 00:22:10,585
Yeah, I'm still here.

541
00:22:12,865 --> 00:22:14,331
Oh, my God. That was amazing.

542
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,799
You just punched a guy.

543
00:22:15,868 --> 00:22:17,234
I punched a guy.

544
00:22:17,302 --> 00:22:18,662
You were freakin'
crazy in there.

545
00:22:18,704 --> 00:22:20,181
Jackson, we are gonna do this.

546
00:22:20,205 --> 00:22:21,539
I can feel it.

547
00:22:21,607 --> 00:22:22,985
I... This is our last
night as residents.

548
00:22:23,009 --> 00:22:24,458
Let's hope.

549
00:22:24,527 --> 00:22:27,105
No, stop that! You just
stop doubting yourself.

550
00:22:27,129 --> 00:22:29,040
We freakin' kicked
that guy's ass in there.

551
00:22:29,064 --> 00:22:30,541
We are gonna
kick this test's ass.

552
00:22:30,565 --> 00:22:32,210
How come you're so
confident all of a sudden?

553
00:22:32,234 --> 00:22:34,251
I'm a soldier.

554
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,280
Yeah, I still don't know
what that means, but...

555
00:22:38,407 --> 00:22:39,973
Mmm. April.

556
00:22:41,343 --> 00:22:42,788
Should I not have done that?

557
00:22:42,812 --> 00:22:43,844
I...

558
00:22:44,329 --> 00:22:45,396
I...

559
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:49,878
If you want me to
stop, just say so,

560
00:22:49,902 --> 00:22:51,769
and I'll stop.

561
00:22:51,837 --> 00:22:54,004
I just... You're...

562
00:22:54,073 --> 00:22:56,223
The way you're kissing
me right now, you just...

563
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:57,436
You're a virgin.
You're a virgin.

564
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:00,394
Yes, because my whole
life since I was a kid,

565
00:23:00,463 --> 00:23:03,596
I had this idea of how my
life was supposed to be,

566
00:23:03,666 --> 00:23:06,400
these rules that I was
supposed to follow,

567
00:23:06,469 --> 00:23:07,851
but I'm not a kid.

568
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:11,255
I'm not the same person I was
when I started my residency.

569
00:23:11,323 --> 00:23:15,409
I just punched a guy,
and it felt really good.

570
00:23:15,478 --> 00:23:18,962
And if something
feels really, really good,

571
00:23:19,031 --> 00:23:20,580
it can't be bad, right?

572
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:21,748
I...

573
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:24,617
Jackson, hey.

574
00:23:26,672 --> 00:23:28,004
It's okay.

575
00:23:28,874 --> 00:23:30,474
Really.

576
00:23:30,543 --> 00:23:31,858
It's okay.

577
00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:38,098
I'm just saying,

578
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:39,711
if Jackson doesn't
pass tomorrow,

579
00:23:39,735 --> 00:23:42,569
I'm holding you
personally responsible.

580
00:23:43,539 --> 00:23:45,572
Don't worry about Jackson.

581
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:48,208
He kept his head down.

582
00:23:49,712 --> 00:23:51,679
He's in good shape.

583
00:23:51,747 --> 00:23:53,847
And how about you?

584
00:23:53,916 --> 00:23:55,248
How's Adele?

585
00:23:56,018 --> 00:23:57,951
Okay, I think.

586
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,886
I haven't seen her in a while.

587
00:23:59,955 --> 00:24:03,357
It confuses her more than
anything when I'm there.

588
00:24:03,425 --> 00:24:05,309
How are you with that?

589
00:24:07,196 --> 00:24:09,330
It... It's the right thing.

590
00:24:11,234 --> 00:24:12,733
Actually...

591
00:24:12,801 --> 00:24:14,318
She's happier.

592
00:24:16,555 --> 00:24:18,166
At our age, you would think

593
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:20,907
we wouldn't have to
grow up anymore, huh?

594
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:28,076
Hey. How are we doing in here?

595
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,084
I am not the problem. He is.

596
00:24:30,169 --> 00:24:32,780
He is completely
unwilling to collaborate.

597
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:35,150
He should've been
in here fixing that leak.

598
00:24:35,174 --> 00:24:36,273
But, no.

599
00:24:36,342 --> 00:24:39,175
He is just not willing
to even hear me.

600
00:24:39,244 --> 00:24:41,211
It's obstructing patient care...

601
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:42,746
Really? You had eight hours.

602
00:24:42,815 --> 00:24:44,247
Why is this on me?

603
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:47,484
Because she'll listen to you.

604
00:24:47,553 --> 00:24:50,153
And because I organized
ladies night. It's your turn.

605
00:24:50,222 --> 00:24:51,400
Jump in and save the day again.

606
00:24:51,424 --> 00:24:52,718
I can't work with
him if he is gonna

607
00:24:52,742 --> 00:24:55,459
fight me on every single thing.

608
00:24:55,528 --> 00:24:57,862
Okay, he is not fighting you.

609
00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:00,564
He disagreed with you
on a course of treatment.

610
00:25:00,633 --> 00:25:01,898
That is something doctors do.

611
00:25:01,967 --> 00:25:03,594
But you don't see
him as a doctor.

612
00:25:03,618 --> 00:25:05,618
You only see him
as the man you blame

613
00:25:05,687 --> 00:25:07,754
for the death of your husband.

614
00:25:07,823 --> 00:25:10,940
And you know and I
know that was not his fault.

615
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:12,476
But he's accepted that blame

616
00:25:12,545 --> 00:25:14,411
because he thinks it
makes you feel better.

617
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,246
He's not fighting you.

618
00:25:16,315 --> 00:25:18,382
But you keep fighting him.

619
00:25:23,556 --> 00:25:24,721
He lost you.

620
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:26,256
He lost his friend,

621
00:25:26,324 --> 00:25:27,719
and now he's
probably losing his wife.

622
00:25:27,743 --> 00:25:29,259
His world is falling apart.

623
00:25:29,328 --> 00:25:31,294
So I hope blaming
him is helping you

624
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:33,680
'cause it sure
isn't helping him.

625
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:45,036
I've turned off his pressors,

626
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:47,105
so we won't be able to manage
his blood pressure anymore,

627
00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:49,324
and his TPN and his fluids,

628
00:25:49,348 --> 00:25:51,931
so he won't be getting
any more nutrition.

629
00:25:53,586 --> 00:25:54,586
You okay?

630
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:02,309
I'm gonna turn off his ventilator
and remove his ET tube.

631
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:06,020
Do you need a minute?

632
00:26:36,629 --> 00:26:38,006
His breathing will slow down,

633
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:41,164
and his heart will
eventually stop.

634
00:26:41,233 --> 00:26:43,867
It may take minutes.
It may take hours.

635
00:26:58,633 --> 00:26:59,966
This is the first time

636
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:02,195
I've ever really been
able to hold him...

637
00:27:03,639 --> 00:27:05,455
Without the tubes and junk.

638
00:27:06,775 --> 00:27:08,108
It's nice.

639
00:27:09,111 --> 00:27:10,210
Stay.

640
00:27:11,797 --> 00:27:12,797
Please.

641
00:27:27,512 --> 00:27:28,578
Thank you, Doctor.

642
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:29,647
Hey.

643
00:27:29,715 --> 00:27:31,715
We meet again.

644
00:27:31,783 --> 00:27:33,666
Hey. Thanks.

645
00:27:33,736 --> 00:27:36,269
By the way, it
wasn't me, was it?

646
00:27:36,338 --> 00:27:38,338
What? That split you two up.

647
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:40,251
The fact that Avery and
I are working together,

648
00:27:40,275 --> 00:27:42,287
the fact that you have
to see me all the time?

649
00:27:42,311 --> 00:27:44,222
I don't... I don't make
you uncomfortable, do I?

650
00:27:44,246 --> 00:27:47,314
No. No, no, no,
no. I... No, you don't.

651
00:27:47,383 --> 00:27:49,917
Great, because this is nice.

652
00:27:49,985 --> 00:27:52,219
Talking to you. I miss it.

653
00:27:52,288 --> 00:27:53,403
I miss you.

654
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:55,104
I miss you, too.

655
00:27:55,708 --> 00:27:56,873
And...

656
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:01,311
The reason that Jackson
and I broke up, it...

657
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:03,124
You know what? We
don't have to talk about that.

658
00:28:03,148 --> 00:28:04,526
It's really... It's none of my
business, so forget I asked.

659
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:08,318
We can be friends who
don't talk about that stuff, ever.

660
00:28:10,455 --> 00:28:11,554
Okay.

661
00:28:15,778 --> 00:28:16,810
Oh...

662
00:28:16,879 --> 00:28:18,228
But as your friend,

663
00:28:18,297 --> 00:28:20,213
if you're not over him,

664
00:28:20,282 --> 00:28:21,965
you should tell him,

665
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:24,518
because, seriously, you
guys are great together.

666
00:28:26,888 --> 00:28:27,905
Thanks.

667
00:28:28,757 --> 00:28:30,524
Don't stay too late.

668
00:28:34,062 --> 00:28:36,341
And I look just to
the left of their head.

669
00:28:36,365 --> 00:28:37,831
It freaks them out.

670
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:38,999
You are terrible.

671
00:28:39,067 --> 00:28:40,534
Oh, come on, now.

672
00:28:40,603 --> 00:28:42,747
You gonna try and tell me
you're all warm and maternal?

673
00:28:42,771 --> 00:28:46,406
I am supportive
and I'm encouraging.

674
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:49,437
Mmm-hmm. I've watched
you with your students.

675
00:28:49,461 --> 00:28:50,644
I know your moves.

676
00:28:50,712 --> 00:28:51,929
Oh, do you now?

677
00:28:51,981 --> 00:28:53,661
I certainly do. I don't know.

678
00:28:53,715 --> 00:28:56,917
I may have a move or
two that you haven't seen.

679
00:29:06,328 --> 00:29:08,390
Would you like
some... Some coffee?

680
00:29:08,414 --> 00:29:09,480
No.

681
00:29:10,583 --> 00:29:12,065
More... More dessert?

682
00:29:13,152 --> 00:29:14,184
No.

683
00:29:16,888 --> 00:29:17,988
Yeah.

684
00:29:19,491 --> 00:29:20,673
You tired?

685
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:24,061
Not in the least.

686
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,940
Would you like me
to get the check?

687
00:29:33,472 --> 00:29:36,339
Honey, could you get
us the check, please?

688
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:38,742
Yes, ma'am.

689
00:31:10,418 --> 00:31:11,518
Okay.

690
00:31:12,821 --> 00:31:16,023
That was really
great. That was really...

691
00:31:16,091 --> 00:31:18,925
Yeah. Yes. Yes. Yes, that was...

692
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:25,298
You were great.
I mean, are you...

693
00:31:27,736 --> 00:31:29,736
Are you glad we did that?

694
00:31:31,807 --> 00:31:32,927
Yeah.

695
00:31:34,543 --> 00:31:35,583
Yeah.

696
00:31:39,598 --> 00:31:41,948
So you're okay? Yeah, I'm fine.

697
00:31:42,017 --> 00:31:44,318
I'm just tired.

698
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:47,253
Yeah.

699
00:31:49,224 --> 00:31:50,464
You should get some sleep.

700
00:31:51,543 --> 00:31:53,824
Yeah, I should get some sleep.

701
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:57,364
Here or... Yeah.

702
00:31:58,867 --> 00:31:59,987
Yeah.

703
00:32:01,136 --> 00:32:02,636
Or...

704
00:32:02,705 --> 00:32:04,304
Or you could go.

705
00:32:05,641 --> 00:32:08,001
Don't you have
to get your pencil?

706
00:32:08,844 --> 00:32:10,093
It's the middle of the night.

707
00:32:11,946 --> 00:32:13,913
Right. Yeah.

708
00:32:13,982 --> 00:32:15,114
But you know what?

709
00:32:15,184 --> 00:32:16,916
I could go if you want.

710
00:32:16,985 --> 00:32:19,018
Yeah. You know what? I'll go.

711
00:32:19,087 --> 00:32:20,087
You can get some sleep.

712
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,972
Okay.

713
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:25,008
You sure you're okay?

714
00:32:25,076 --> 00:32:26,156
I'm great.

715
00:32:28,847 --> 00:32:30,714
I'll see you tomorrow.

716
00:32:46,215 --> 00:32:48,348
You can stay with me.

717
00:32:48,416 --> 00:32:52,185
Alex, Jackson, and April
moved out. There's room.

718
00:32:52,254 --> 00:32:54,955
I don't want to
come stay with you.

719
00:32:55,023 --> 00:32:56,656
Is he moving out?

720
00:32:58,727 --> 00:32:59,793
I don't know.

721
00:32:59,861 --> 00:33:01,723
But you're not
together. You broke up.

722
00:33:01,747 --> 00:33:03,496
No, we can't just...

723
00:33:04,767 --> 00:33:05,932
Break up.

724
00:33:06,001 --> 00:33:08,034
We're married. I know.

725
00:33:08,102 --> 00:33:11,838
I mean, I think Derek used a
pretty good attorney for his divorce.

726
00:33:11,907 --> 00:33:13,473
I don't want an attorney.

727
00:33:13,542 --> 00:33:14,782
Okay.

728
00:33:16,628 --> 00:33:18,962
Well... He cheated on you.

729
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:20,313
Yeah, this isn't you and Derek.

730
00:33:20,382 --> 00:33:22,749
He didn't fall in love with her.

731
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:27,120
He screwed someone...

732
00:33:27,823 --> 00:33:29,188
One time...

733
00:33:29,991 --> 00:33:31,090
When he was drunk.

734
00:33:31,159 --> 00:33:33,476
I mean, does that mean
my marriage is over?

735
00:33:33,545 --> 00:33:35,312
What he did was wrong.

736
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:37,514
And if it were me...

737
00:33:37,583 --> 00:33:41,768
Hey, if I screwed someone
once when I was drunk,

738
00:33:41,837 --> 00:33:43,637
and I could, I know me...

739
00:33:43,705 --> 00:33:45,338
If I did it...

740
00:33:46,675 --> 00:33:49,008
I wouldn't want Owen
to leave me for that.

741
00:33:49,077 --> 00:33:52,562
Everything isn't so perfectly
right or perfectly wrong.

742
00:33:54,149 --> 00:33:55,264
Okay.

743
00:33:58,052 --> 00:33:59,268
Say it.

744
00:34:01,472 --> 00:34:03,152
You got married awfully fast.

745
00:34:06,712 --> 00:34:07,994
Be on my side.

746
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:10,080
I am on your side.

747
00:34:10,148 --> 00:34:13,416
But it, you know, it's
like you're defending him.

748
00:34:13,485 --> 00:34:15,919
And I don't know how
we're supposed to feel.

749
00:34:15,987 --> 00:34:18,955
Well, he's my husband.
This is a marriage.

750
00:34:21,075 --> 00:34:22,175
Okay.

751
00:34:29,718 --> 00:34:30,866
I want to leave him.

752
00:34:32,971 --> 00:34:34,487
Okay.

753
00:34:34,556 --> 00:34:36,589
So that means I'm gone.

754
00:34:36,658 --> 00:34:39,342
So you're gonna take
the job at Stanford?

755
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:40,844
Or Columbia.

756
00:34:43,281 --> 00:34:45,681
Well, you'd be leaving me, too.

757
00:34:46,401 --> 00:34:48,346
Well, you might
go to the Brigham.

758
00:34:48,370 --> 00:34:49,852
Probably not.

759
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:52,705
Maybe.

760
00:34:57,579 --> 00:34:59,813
Yeah, I... I'd leave you, too.

761
00:35:04,719 --> 00:35:06,085
There are phones, you know?

762
00:35:06,154 --> 00:35:07,287
You hate the phone.

763
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:08,922
I know I do.

764
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:10,156
But...

765
00:35:11,092 --> 00:35:13,059
I don't have to like it.

766
00:35:17,465 --> 00:35:19,865
Put your hand under the door.

767
00:35:20,402 --> 00:35:21,501
What?

768
00:35:23,104 --> 00:35:24,470
Just do it.

769
00:35:52,634 --> 00:35:53,866
Oh, God.

770
00:35:55,637 --> 00:35:57,070
He stopped breathing.

771
00:35:57,139 --> 00:35:59,072
No. I'm not ready yet.

772
00:35:59,141 --> 00:36:00,868
I don't... I don't...
Just please...

773
00:36:00,892 --> 00:36:02,559
I'm not ready yet.

774
00:36:09,701 --> 00:36:10,917
Oh, God.

775
00:36:11,453 --> 00:36:12,686
Oh, God.

776
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:17,123
Oh, my sweet Tommy.

777
00:36:20,111 --> 00:36:22,061
Mommy loves you so much.

778
00:36:23,364 --> 00:36:27,500
Oh, Mommy loves you so, so much.

779
00:36:44,686 --> 00:36:45,926
How's Morgan doing?

780
00:36:45,954 --> 00:36:47,548
She just lost her baby. How
do you think she's doing?

781
00:36:47,572 --> 00:36:48,821
Okay, look, Karev...

782
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:50,167
Come on. It's been a long night.

783
00:36:50,191 --> 00:36:51,803
Whatever you want
to nag me about,

784
00:36:51,827 --> 00:36:53,721
just... Can't it
wait? No, it can't.

785
00:36:53,745 --> 00:36:55,506
I need you as my
peds fellow next year.

786
00:36:55,530 --> 00:36:57,125
I need you to pass your boards,

787
00:36:57,149 --> 00:36:59,430
and you can't pass your
boards unless you take them.

788
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:02,668
Look, I need to stay
here with Morgan...

789
00:37:02,754 --> 00:37:04,599
Morgan needs to get
by without you right now.

790
00:37:04,623 --> 00:37:06,201
You were her baby's
doctor. That's all.

791
00:37:06,225 --> 00:37:08,319
She's gonna be okay.
I will make sure she is.

792
00:37:08,343 --> 00:37:10,176
The test is gonna
be in three hours.

793
00:37:10,262 --> 00:37:13,896
I have never once seen you
give up on a patient, Karev.

794
00:37:14,633 --> 00:37:15,915
Don't give up on this.

795
00:37:15,983 --> 00:37:17,261
I'm never gonna
get there in time.

796
00:37:17,285 --> 00:37:18,384
Try.

797
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:30,963
Are you up?

798
00:37:31,032 --> 00:37:32,231
Uh-huh.

799
00:37:32,934 --> 00:37:34,701
How are you feeling?

800
00:37:35,603 --> 00:37:36,769
Worse.

801
00:37:37,471 --> 00:37:39,105
Get up.

802
00:37:39,174 --> 00:37:41,441
Seriously, Cristina,
I don't think I can.

803
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:43,009
Open the door.

804
00:37:43,878 --> 00:37:45,578
Just go get ready. I'll be fine.

805
00:37:45,647 --> 00:37:47,147
Open the door, Mer.

806
00:37:58,276 --> 00:37:59,559
Easy.

807
00:37:59,627 --> 00:38:00,743
Easy.

808
00:38:03,848 --> 00:38:07,083
Okay, now that's the
last time you throw up.

809
00:38:07,152 --> 00:38:09,035
Mind over matter.
You can do this.

810
00:38:09,521 --> 00:38:10,620
Okay?

811
00:38:12,491 --> 00:38:13,923
Fine, Ma. You were right.

812
00:38:13,992 --> 00:38:15,307
I always feel...

813
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:19,011
Sorry. I thought this
was my mom's room.

814
00:38:19,081 --> 00:38:20,413
Uh... Uh...

815
00:38:20,482 --> 00:38:23,127
No, no problem. I thought
you were room service.

816
00:38:23,151 --> 00:38:25,071
No problem at all. Okay.

817
00:38:34,329 --> 00:38:35,361
No.

818
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,160
Good luck, baby.

819
00:38:49,844 --> 00:38:50,910
I...

820
00:38:52,948 --> 00:38:55,481
Do you think he's traumatized?

821
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:56,782
For life.

822
00:38:59,637 --> 00:39:01,404
Well, we did it.

823
00:39:01,472 --> 00:39:03,551
We made it through the night.

824
00:39:03,575 --> 00:39:07,844
You know why, Zola? 'Cause
we're survivors, me and you.

825
00:39:07,913 --> 00:39:09,991
And your mom's
gonna pass the boards,

826
00:39:10,015 --> 00:39:11,525
and hopefully you don't throw up

827
00:39:11,549 --> 00:39:13,989
on me in the next
15 minutes, right?

828
00:39:15,904 --> 00:39:17,464
Where have you been all night?

829
00:39:17,488 --> 00:39:19,400
At the hospital. I was
finishing your neuro research.

830
00:39:19,424 --> 00:39:21,958
Why is she in a
bumblebee costume?

831
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:25,026
She's thrown up on
all of her other clothes.

832
00:39:31,937 --> 00:39:33,569
Mark said that...

833
00:39:34,572 --> 00:39:36,239
That he misses me.

834
00:39:37,575 --> 00:39:40,043
But I miss him, you know? I...

835
00:39:42,313 --> 00:39:43,679
I really...

836
00:39:43,749 --> 00:39:45,414
I really miss him.

837
00:39:46,284 --> 00:39:47,350
You know, and he...

838
00:39:47,418 --> 00:39:49,085
He thinks that I
still love Jackson,

839
00:39:49,154 --> 00:39:51,354
but I try to tell
him that I don't.

840
00:39:51,422 --> 00:39:54,457
I try to tell him
that I still love him...

841
00:39:56,527 --> 00:39:58,928
But I open my mouth...

842
00:40:00,098 --> 00:40:02,465
And nothing comes out.

843
00:40:02,533 --> 00:40:05,068
And everything is terrible.

844
00:40:07,538 --> 00:40:09,271
It's gonna be okay.

845
00:40:11,175 --> 00:40:12,875
It's gonna be okay.

846
00:40:19,334 --> 00:40:20,433
What?

847
00:40:21,937 --> 00:40:23,146
Cristina texted,

848
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:24,604
and she's about to go in.

849
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:26,505
She's feeling good. And...

850
00:40:27,475 --> 00:40:28,635
And she's ready.

851
00:40:30,011 --> 00:40:32,292

you'd want to know.

even gonna look at me or...

00:40:55,103 --> 00:40:56,135
No.

861
00:40:57,705 --> 00:41:00,073
No, it's not you,
Jackson. It's...

862
00:41:00,808 --> 00:41:01,924
It's Jesus.

863
00:41:03,978 --> 00:41:06,679
I was a virgin
because I love Jesus.

864
00:41:07,915 --> 00:41:10,132
