1
00:00:05,406 --> 00:00:08,246
<i>Every little kid knows
the words to the song.</i>

2
00:00:09,609 --> 00:00:12,005
<i>"The foot bone's
connected to the leg bone."</i>

3
00:00:12,029 --> 00:00:13,862
I think you're beautiful.

4
00:00:13,931 --> 00:00:16,030
<i>"The leg bone's connected
to the knee bone."</i>

5
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:19,868
<i>In med school,</i>

6
00:00:19,936 --> 00:00:22,337
<i>you learn it's a little more
complicated than that.</i>

7
00:00:22,406 --> 00:00:25,290
I'm trying to love you.
Why won't you let me?

8
00:00:25,342 --> 00:00:27,509
<i>But still...</i> Have a baby?

9
00:00:27,578 --> 00:00:30,089
This isn't pizza versus Thai.
You don't give a little on a baby.

10
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:31,446
Cristina, I am asking...

11
00:00:31,532 --> 00:00:33,448
I am saying no!

12
00:00:33,517 --> 00:00:35,249
<i>The song's not wrong.</i>

13
00:00:35,318 --> 00:00:36,751
It hurts

14
00:00:37,488 --> 00:00:38,653
to love you.

15
00:00:38,722 --> 00:00:40,355
<i>Everything is connected.</i>

16
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:51,183
I'm still shaking.

17
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:53,118
You do that every day?

18
00:00:53,186 --> 00:00:55,353
Not on the weekends, usually.

19
00:00:55,423 --> 00:00:58,384
I'm pretty sure I'd be an
alcoholic if I had your job.

20
00:00:58,408 --> 00:01:02,561
They kind of frown upon
alcoholism in my line of work, so...

21
00:01:05,349 --> 00:01:06,381
Whoa.

22
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:07,966
Nice.

23
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,837
See? That's why I
could never be a surgeon.

24
00:01:19,262 --> 00:01:20,712
Thank you for the drink.

25
00:01:20,781 --> 00:01:22,397
I gotta go.

26
00:01:22,465 --> 00:01:24,833
One more.

27
00:01:24,902 --> 00:01:27,252
Come on. Please.
It's the least I can do.

28
00:01:30,891 --> 00:01:32,084
<i>And then what happened?</i>

29
00:01:32,108 --> 00:01:33,241
Cristina.

30
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:34,709
And then what happened?

31
00:01:34,778 --> 00:01:36,339
Cristina, I don't know
what good this is doing.

32
00:01:36,363 --> 00:01:38,275
There isn't any good. This...

33
00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:39,943
Seriously, how could
this be doing any good?

34
00:01:39,967 --> 00:01:41,077
I'm not saying... Cristina, I...

35
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:42,141
Stop saying my name.

36
00:01:46,357 --> 00:01:49,290
<i>The foot bone's
connected to the leg bone.</i>

37
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,527
<i>The leg bone's connected
to the knee bone.</i>

38
00:01:52,596 --> 00:01:54,663
I want to fix this.

39
00:01:54,732 --> 00:01:55,764
I want to fix this.

40
00:01:55,832 --> 00:01:57,699
Whatever you want
me to do, I will do.

41
00:01:57,768 --> 00:01:59,200
But this...

42
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:02,470
You're asking me to hurt you.

43
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:04,289
You're asking me to

44
00:02:04,357 --> 00:02:06,925
torture you with the details...

45
00:02:06,994 --> 00:02:08,827
Of you having sex
with another woman.

46
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:10,561
Yes.

47
00:02:14,734 --> 00:02:17,335
<i>And if you take one piece out...</i>

48
00:02:17,404 --> 00:02:19,871
I wanna know

49
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:22,274
every detail.

50
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:24,342
You wanna fix this?

51
00:02:24,411 --> 00:02:26,778
I wanna know how this happened.

52
00:02:26,847 --> 00:02:29,247
<i>The rest just</i>

53
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:30,732
<i>falls apart.</i>

54
00:02:30,801 --> 00:02:33,046
You've found a 7.5
centimeter triple-A

55
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:35,265
on your 85-year-old patient. Go.

56
00:02:35,289 --> 00:02:37,639
Get an angio, assess his
pulmonary and cardiac function,

57
00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:39,975
and see if he's a candidate
for an endovascular repair.

58
00:02:40,044 --> 00:02:41,721
Nope. Why not?

59
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:43,489
Because the patient's dead.
You killed him. He's dead.

60
00:02:43,513 --> 00:02:45,547
I didn't kill him.
I did a stent graft

61
00:02:45,615 --> 00:02:47,527
and now he's living without
the threat of a rupture,

62
00:02:47,551 --> 00:02:48,816
which is not dead.

63
00:02:48,885 --> 00:02:51,013
Hmm. I think you should buy
him flowers, 'cause he dead.

64
00:02:51,037 --> 00:02:52,404
He is not dead.

65
00:02:52,472 --> 00:02:54,684
I saved him the complications
of an open procedure

66
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:56,575
with a minimally
invasive technique.

67
00:02:57,127 --> 00:02:59,361
He's not dead.

68
00:03:01,432 --> 00:03:03,209
Why are we stopping?
Because we're done.

69
00:03:03,233 --> 00:03:05,393
Because I killed him? I
told you, I did not kill him.

70
00:03:05,452 --> 00:03:07,747
I know, and so do you, even
when I try to psych you out of it,

71
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:09,304
which means

72
00:03:09,373 --> 00:03:11,117
you're ready for the boards.

73
00:03:11,141 --> 00:03:12,368
The Torres method is inside you.

74
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:14,070
So I'm gonna go home to my wife,

75
00:03:14,094 --> 00:03:16,072
because I am sick of pushing
this baby around this park

76
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,623
every morning at the
butt crack of dawn.

77
00:03:17,647 --> 00:03:19,347
And I...

78
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:22,536
You're free, Grey. Go
do whatever it is you do.

79
00:03:25,222 --> 00:03:26,521
Okay.

80
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:28,823
Don't get me wrong, I love this.

81
00:03:28,892 --> 00:03:30,024
I like that, too.

82
00:03:31,212 --> 00:03:33,778
But this is your
"drink coffee in the

83
00:03:33,847 --> 00:03:36,497
"tunnels with
Cristina, bitch mode,

84
00:03:36,566 --> 00:03:39,768
"griping about the world" time.

85
00:03:39,836 --> 00:03:42,137
This is your Yang
time. What's going on?

86
00:03:43,907 --> 00:03:45,841
Nothing's wrong.
You want me to stop?

87
00:03:45,909 --> 00:03:48,710
I didn't say you should stop.
I asked you what's wrong.

88
00:03:50,046 --> 00:03:51,145
Damn it.

89
00:03:55,886 --> 00:03:58,720
"Excellence is not an
act, but a habit," Aristotle.

90
00:03:58,789 --> 00:04:01,273
Avery, what is Aristotle
doing in our staff meeting,

91
00:04:01,342 --> 00:04:03,587
and why are you even in
here handing these out?

92
00:04:03,611 --> 00:04:04,771
You mean when I could
be practicing medicine

93
00:04:04,795 --> 00:04:06,194
or studying for my boards?

94
00:04:06,262 --> 00:04:08,380
Yeah, I've asked myself
that same question.

95
00:04:08,449 --> 00:04:11,009
Mmm! This is delicious. When
did Hunt bump up the donut budget?

96
00:04:11,051 --> 00:04:12,395
As Chief, I'm a firm believer

97
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:14,252
that a nice variety
of baked goods

98
00:04:14,321 --> 00:04:16,165
is the right way to
start any meeting.

99
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:17,801
As Chief? What are
you talking about?

100
00:04:17,825 --> 00:04:19,545
Seriously? Seriously?
Wait. What happened?

101
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:21,192
Okay, calm down, everyone.

102
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:24,228
Dr. Hunt and Dr. Yang
are down with the flu.

103
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:27,232
I'll be acting Chief in
Dr. Hunt's absence.

104
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,083
Could be a day. Could be a week.

105
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:32,371
What do we got for today?

106
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:35,090
Let me get this straight.

107
00:04:35,158 --> 00:04:37,292
Dr. Hunt asked you

108
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,813
to fill in as Chief, you,
Mark Sloan, by name?

109
00:04:41,882 --> 00:04:43,682
Yes, he did.

110
00:04:44,668 --> 00:04:46,334
Any other questions?

111
00:04:46,403 --> 00:04:49,171
I like the part about "Excellence
is not an act, but a habit."

112
00:04:49,239 --> 00:04:51,284
Hey, so I got us a reservation
at Jane's on Market.

113
00:04:51,308 --> 00:04:53,135
It's the one with the little
twinkly lights all around it.

114
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:54,609
Have you been
there yet? It's new.

115
00:04:54,678 --> 00:04:56,356
We haven't. It's beautiful
and kind of romantic,

116
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:58,023
and I realize that ladies' night
is different than date night,

117
00:04:58,047 --> 00:04:59,859
but I have been in the
lab for the last two weeks

118
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:01,411
and smelling like
formaldehyde, and I just...

119
00:05:01,435 --> 00:05:03,001
I need to be
someplace beautiful.

120
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,602
Yeah, of course.

121
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:06,349
Great. Good. I'm excited. So
excited. This is gonna be great.

122
00:05:06,373 --> 00:05:07,505
Am I talking really fast?

123
00:05:07,574 --> 00:05:08,673
Not in a weird way.

124
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:10,075
I'm sorry. I'm just wired.

125
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:12,110
The house is so quiet
when it's empty, you know?

126
00:05:12,179 --> 00:05:13,656
I've been leaning
really hard on the coffee.

127
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,600
But anyway, okay. So
I'll see you guys tonight.

128
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:16,914
Ladies' night.

129
00:05:17,851 --> 00:05:19,228
I have no idea
what just happened.

130
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:22,186
I told her last week that
we'd do a ladies' night.

131
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:23,522
Like at a girl bar?

132
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:25,168
Do we need to have a
talk about boundaries?

133
00:05:25,192 --> 00:05:26,569
No, no, not a "ladies'
night" ladies' night.

134
00:05:26,593 --> 00:05:28,233
Like a just a night
out for Teddy.

135
00:05:28,262 --> 00:05:29,805
Okay, so do we
have another lady,

136
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:32,096
or is it just two lesbian
moms and a widow

137
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:34,533
at Seattle's most
romantic restaurant?

138
00:05:35,686 --> 00:05:36,851
Ooh! Bailey.

139
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,063
Really, that's your go to?

140
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:39,164
What?

141
00:05:39,188 --> 00:05:41,989
So, um, Teddy...

142
00:05:42,058 --> 00:05:44,659
Poor, sad, widowed Teddy,
wants to have a girls' night.

143
00:05:44,728 --> 00:05:46,356
Ladies. Ladies' night.

144
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:47,895
Absolutely not.

145
00:05:47,965 --> 00:05:50,810
No, it's her first night out.
It's a big step. She needs us.

146
00:05:50,834 --> 00:05:52,667
She has you, the two of you.

147
00:05:52,735 --> 00:05:54,713
That's about as much happy
as any person can bear.

148
00:05:54,737 --> 00:05:56,849
She made a reservation
at a romantic restaurant.

149
00:05:56,873 --> 00:05:58,384
I mean, would you want
to be a third-wheel widow

150
00:05:58,408 --> 00:06:01,088
at a restaurant with us and
a bunch of twinkly lights?

151
00:06:03,546 --> 00:06:04,629
You're buying.

152
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:06,742
I figured everyone
could pitch in

153
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:08,733
for our dear friend, the widow.

154
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:12,899
Okay, fine. We're buying.

155
00:06:12,923 --> 00:06:14,773
See you tonight. My god.

156
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:17,152
I've got some good
news for you, Neil.

157
00:06:17,176 --> 00:06:18,543
Oh?

158
00:06:18,612 --> 00:06:21,396
You've changed your
mind about euthanasia?

159
00:06:21,465 --> 00:06:23,265
We found you a donor.

160
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:24,466
For the whole thing?

161
00:06:24,535 --> 00:06:25,729
The whole thing.

162
00:06:25,753 --> 00:06:27,886
Dr. Webber, you know I love you,

163
00:06:27,955 --> 00:06:31,155
but I believe you stood
me up at this dance before.

164
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:35,309
A couple of times, but I
am here with a new corsage.

165
00:06:35,378 --> 00:06:36,611
Dr. Grey.

166
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,798
Neil Sheridan, 62, presents
with short gut syndrome

167
00:06:39,867 --> 00:06:42,107
caused by a resection
of the small intestine.

168
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:44,497
Years of T.P.N. has
caused the liver to fail,

169
00:06:44,521 --> 00:06:47,421
resulting in the need for
a multi-organ transplant

170
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:50,725
of the small intestine, large
intestine, stomach, pancreas and liver.

171
00:06:50,794 --> 00:06:52,960
All from one guy.

172
00:06:53,029 --> 00:06:55,246
Try to find that on Craigslist.

173
00:06:55,315 --> 00:06:57,749
And we've scheduled
you for surgery today.

174
00:06:57,817 --> 00:06:59,734
I'll believe that when I see it.

175
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:09,093
Neil, do you want me to call your
family? I'm sure they'd love to visit.

176
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:11,329
Don't worry about me, sunshine.

177
00:07:11,398 --> 00:07:13,498
My family came to
say their good-byes

178
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:15,634
the first two times.

179
00:07:15,702 --> 00:07:18,670
"We love you. We'll
miss you." It was sweet,

180
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,806
but I've heard it.

181
00:07:20,874 --> 00:07:23,858
I told 'em not to
bother this time around.

182
00:07:23,927 --> 00:07:25,326
Okay.

183
00:07:25,395 --> 00:07:28,113
If you change your
mind, you let me know.

184
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:29,826
I will. Okay.

185
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:31,333
But I won't.

186
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,670
Where have you been?

187
00:07:35,739 --> 00:07:37,066
We're halfway through
the new batch of flash cards.

188
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:38,568
Yeah, Hunt and Yang
are out sick today,

189
00:07:38,592 --> 00:07:40,536
so Sloan's the Chief,
and I am the Chief's bitch.

190
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,593
Lucky me.

191
00:07:41,662 --> 00:07:42,739
No distractions.
Kepner, hit me again.

192
00:07:42,763 --> 00:07:45,397
Okay, a woman with
dysuria, incomplete voiding

193
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:46,942
and a palpable suburethral mass.

194
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,416
Urethral carcinoma.

195
00:07:48,484 --> 00:07:50,051
Damn it. I had one
of those last year.

196
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,469
Um... Uh...

197
00:07:51,538 --> 00:07:54,205
We did radiation
and surgical excision.

198
00:07:54,274 --> 00:07:56,824
No! Would it be chemo?

199
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:58,776
An ectopic ureter,
or it could be.

200
00:07:58,845 --> 00:08:00,122
I mean, I scrubbed
in on one of those,

201
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:02,981
but I don't remember the
technique the urologist used.

202
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:05,232
Sounds like
urethral diverticulum.

203
00:08:05,301 --> 00:08:07,853
And if it's proximal, I
would do a partial ablation

204
00:08:07,921 --> 00:08:10,254
because it's much less
likely to result in a fistula.

205
00:08:10,324 --> 00:08:13,074
You don't even need to know
advanced urology for the boards.

206
00:08:13,143 --> 00:08:15,560
But I do, because the
Torres method is in me.

207
00:08:17,297 --> 00:08:18,541
Total crap. You get
to study with Torres

208
00:08:18,565 --> 00:08:19,942
while the rest of us
get to sink like rocks.

209
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:21,877
I hope you're happy when
you're alone in the OR

210
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:24,180
and the rest of us are working
the free clinic at the mall.

211
00:08:24,204 --> 00:08:26,049
My whole brain is crammed
with so many hypotheticals,

212
00:08:26,073 --> 00:08:27,616
I can't even remember
what real cases

213
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,151
I was actually there
for. I am screwed.

214
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:31,109
I'll tell you who's
screwed, Yang.

215
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,505
The boards are
around the corner,

216
00:08:32,529 --> 00:08:33,839
no one's seen her
study, she's out sick.

217
00:08:33,863 --> 00:08:35,541
She's gonna get
creamed. Yang is fine.

218
00:08:35,565 --> 00:08:37,543
You can't just pass the
boards on raw talent, okay?

219
00:08:37,567 --> 00:08:39,045
It is an artificial environment,

220
00:08:39,069 --> 00:08:40,496
which requires
massive amounts...

221
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,087
Cristina is fine. Okay?

222
00:08:46,994 --> 00:08:48,109
What is the point?

223
00:08:48,178 --> 00:08:50,144
What is the point?

224
00:08:50,213 --> 00:08:52,258
The point is, I wanna know.

225
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:53,843
The point is, I have a right...

226
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:55,967
You don't have
a right, not to this.

227
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:59,704
No, I have a right as your
wife to know what you did.

228
00:08:59,773 --> 00:09:04,492
I'm not gonna do this. I am
not gonna tell you every detail.

229
00:09:04,561 --> 00:09:06,001
I cheated. Yes.

230
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:08,246
I cheated. I did
a horrible thing.

231
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:10,448
I know. I know I
did a horrible thing.

232
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:13,962
But this is not what
we're gonna do.

233
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:15,753
I'm not gonna
play a little movie

234
00:09:15,822 --> 00:09:17,817
of all of my crimes so that you
can decide that I'm a monster.

235
00:09:17,841 --> 00:09:19,491
Okay, then get out.

236
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:20,559
You want me to leave?

237
00:09:23,847 --> 00:09:25,347
You're answering the phone?

238
00:09:25,415 --> 00:09:26,892
It's Meredith. She's
called, like, five times.

239
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:28,861
If I don't answer
it, she'll come over,

240
00:09:28,885 --> 00:09:31,245
because we have
the flu, remember?

241
00:09:31,287 --> 00:09:32,898
Hey. <i>Hey.</i>

242
00:09:32,922 --> 00:09:34,622
<i>How are you feeling?</i>

243
00:09:34,691 --> 00:09:36,291
<i>I'm okay. It's just the flu.</i>

244
00:09:39,062 --> 00:09:40,573
I should come and check on you,

245
00:09:40,597 --> 00:09:42,508
because it could be something
more serious than the flu.

246
00:09:42,532 --> 00:09:45,633
No, it's fine. It's the flu.

247
00:09:47,871 --> 00:09:49,471
Owen's there?

248
00:09:49,539 --> 00:09:51,906
Yeah, Owen is
here. He's sick, too.

249
00:09:51,975 --> 00:09:53,291
Oh, I bet he is.

250
00:10:00,616 --> 00:10:02,077
Cristina, I... <i>I gotta go.</i>

251
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,341
<i>Cristina, wait.</i>

252
00:10:04,004 --> 00:10:05,004
Cristina?

253
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:11,977
So am I staying or am I going?

254
00:10:14,881 --> 00:10:16,464
That's up to you.

255
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:37,869
It was the day after
we quit therapy.

256
00:10:39,272 --> 00:10:41,906
And I met her at the hospital.

257
00:10:53,753 --> 00:10:55,186
Yeah. We're fine.

258
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:00,592
We're fine.

259
00:11:00,644 --> 00:11:02,259
I should be your person!

260
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:03,411
<i>Be my person!</i>

261
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:06,748
Be my person, Owen!
Be my freaking person!

262
00:11:08,969 --> 00:11:10,368
Be my person.

263
00:11:12,456 --> 00:11:14,989
29-year-old female.
MVC collision with a truck.

264
00:11:15,058 --> 00:11:16,624
Take her to trauma one.

265
00:11:16,693 --> 00:11:19,461
Hypotensive in the field. She
received two liters LR en route.

266
00:11:19,529 --> 00:11:22,430
Okay, let's get trauma labs
and set up for an ultrasound.

267
00:11:22,499 --> 00:11:23,743
All right. I'll check it.

268
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:24,899
Is anybody with her?

269
00:11:25,535 --> 00:11:26,634
I am.

270
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:45,419
What was her name?

271
00:11:49,358 --> 00:11:51,092
Honestly? I...

272
00:11:52,328 --> 00:11:53,961
I don't remember.

273
00:11:55,698 --> 00:11:57,131
He's in the car.

274
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,767
Chief.

275
00:11:59,836 --> 00:12:02,198
See, from 1:00 to 2:00, you
have "Lunch with the Chief."

276
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:04,189
I told you to call it
"Beef with the Chief."

277
00:12:04,257 --> 00:12:05,623
It's got a ring to it.

278
00:12:05,692 --> 00:12:07,592
You got a beef, come
meet with the Chief.

279
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,888
I didn't realize you
were serious about that.

280
00:12:09,912 --> 00:12:12,090
You need to let people get
the little things off their chests

281
00:12:12,114 --> 00:12:14,014
before they become big things.

282
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:15,916
I'm serious about
this Chief thing, Avery.

283
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:17,446
It's my shot. I
want to do it right.

284
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:20,020
"Beef with the Chief," put
it in the schedule tomorrow.

285
00:12:22,192 --> 00:12:24,170
Dr. Shepherd, Dr. Warren.

286
00:12:24,194 --> 00:12:25,271
Here.

287
00:12:25,295 --> 00:12:27,039
Mr. Cooper. How are you feeling?

288
00:12:27,063 --> 00:12:29,408
Like I would kill my own
mother for a burger and a shake.

289
00:12:29,432 --> 00:12:30,615
Jason Cooper,

290
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:33,496
29-year-old male with
advanced juvenile arthritis,

291
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,320
causing fusion of the jaw

292
00:12:35,388 --> 00:12:38,083
and extensive fusion of
the C2, C3 and C4 vertebrae.

293
00:12:38,107 --> 00:12:39,952
He's been on a feeding
tube for the past eight months.

294
00:12:39,976 --> 00:12:41,376
No solid food at all.

295
00:12:41,444 --> 00:12:43,277
Don't worry, Mr. Cooper.

296
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:44,996
After we break your jaw

297
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:47,910
and put in those sweet
titanium hinges I made for you,

298
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:50,601
you'll be eating
burgers again real soon.

299
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:52,314
Could we have a word
with you outside, please?

300
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:53,604
Of course.

301
00:12:53,673 --> 00:12:55,100
Ben and I don't think we
should do the surgery today.

302
00:12:55,124 --> 00:12:56,707
Why not?

303
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,220
With his cervical fusion, lying
him down on an operating table

304
00:12:58,244 --> 00:12:59,922
is gonna put pressure
on the base of his spine.

305
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:01,607
Not to mention that orotracheal

306
00:13:01,631 --> 00:13:03,275
intubation is
impossible on this guy.

307
00:13:03,299 --> 00:13:06,111
I'll do nasotracheal, but if
there's any compromise to the tube

308
00:13:06,135 --> 00:13:07,713
while he's under and
he's got no mobility...

309
00:13:07,737 --> 00:13:09,503
Let's just say, I can't
guarantee anything.

310
00:13:09,573 --> 00:13:11,021
What's your recommendation?

311
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:13,169
We postpone the surgery
until other plans can be made.

312
00:13:13,193 --> 00:13:15,154
And, Dr. Avery, what would
support performing the surgery

313
00:13:15,178 --> 00:13:17,078
as soon as possible?

314
00:13:17,146 --> 00:13:20,264
The patient has a major
abscess in the back of his mouth.

315
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:23,217
Which could lead to
sepsis or endocarditis.

316
00:13:23,286 --> 00:13:25,936
Infection's a killer, which
is why this can't wait.

317
00:13:26,006 --> 00:13:27,566
So let's figure out a way to get

318
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:29,151
Mr. Cooper into
surgery on schedule.

319
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:31,053
Frankly, I don't know what
you think I can do for him

320
00:13:31,077 --> 00:13:32,310
by 3:00 this afternoon.

321
00:13:32,379 --> 00:13:33,856
Rise. Excuse me?

322
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,174
You have it in you.
Lost causes, right?

323
00:13:36,198 --> 00:13:38,649
Making the impossible possible?

324
00:13:38,718 --> 00:13:41,718
Rise to the challenge,
Shepherd. I believe in you.

325
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:44,004
Rise.

326
00:13:46,243 --> 00:13:47,591
All right, guys.

327
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:52,297
So you take orders
from Sloan now?

328
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:07,761
Hey! Where do you think
you're... You just can't take those.

329
00:14:07,848 --> 00:14:10,248
I was just gonna copy 'em
and bring 'em right back.

330
00:14:10,317 --> 00:14:11,666
It'll take two seconds.

331
00:14:11,735 --> 00:14:14,168
They don't teach you
about HIPAA in med school?

332
00:14:14,237 --> 00:14:16,937
You don't see a copy
machine, do you?

333
00:14:17,006 --> 00:14:18,906
That's because these
charts are private.

334
00:14:18,974 --> 00:14:22,576
They don't get copied and
they don't leave this room, ever.

335
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,646
Come on.

336
00:14:25,714 --> 00:14:28,394
I'm a fifth year. I'm just
trying to study for my boards.

337
00:14:28,418 --> 00:14:30,284
I need real cases. So read 'em.

338
00:14:30,353 --> 00:14:32,248
Read 'em all, but
they don't go outta here

339
00:14:32,272 --> 00:14:34,588
except in your
brain, understand?

340
00:14:36,426 --> 00:14:38,259
Yeah, I think I do.

341
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:40,894
There you go.

342
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:43,864
Hey, you got a busy
schedule today?

343
00:14:43,933 --> 00:14:45,265
Why?

344
00:14:45,335 --> 00:14:47,045
Do you need help
with that thyroidectomy?

345
00:14:47,069 --> 00:14:48,781
Because I've never done one,
and I was just reading about

346
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:51,850
how it can sometimes cause
a thyroid storm, which is...

347
00:14:51,874 --> 00:14:52,985
How cool is that, you know?

348
00:14:53,009 --> 00:14:54,142
Yeah, maybe.

349
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:57,845
Listen, your whole
photographic memory thing,

350
00:14:57,914 --> 00:14:59,864
how does that work?

351
00:14:59,933 --> 00:15:02,500
You want me to memorize these?

352
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:03,601
Yeah.

353
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:05,397
All of them?
That'll take forever.

354
00:15:05,421 --> 00:15:06,703
Lexie, we need your help.

355
00:15:06,773 --> 00:15:09,384
We can't keep doing stupid
hypotheticals off index cards.

356
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:11,453
We need someone to
question us off real cases.

357
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:12,988
I have rounds. I have post-ops.

358
00:15:13,012 --> 00:15:16,230
Lexie, next year when
Karev and I are attendings,

359
00:15:16,298 --> 00:15:19,533
we will be assigning surgeries
and putting in our recommendations

360
00:15:19,602 --> 00:15:20,884
for chief resident.

361
00:15:20,954 --> 00:15:23,521
Are you sure you want to
get off on the wrong foot?

362
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,223
No.

363
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:26,557
No.

364
00:15:31,381 --> 00:15:32,847
Great!

365
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:35,197
It is so much fun that you're
gonna be studying with us.

366
00:15:38,488 --> 00:15:40,332
You get to watch
the game tonight.

367
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:41,389
I do?

368
00:15:41,457 --> 00:15:43,536
I gotta go to some girls' night

369
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:46,093
Callie and Arizona
put together for Teddy.

370
00:15:47,062 --> 00:15:48,874
I mean, that's good, right?

371
00:15:48,898 --> 00:15:51,977
Wasn't I gonna get some
long story about how this is

372
00:15:52,001 --> 00:15:53,545
"the game of a lifetime,

373
00:15:53,569 --> 00:15:56,303
"and if you would just
sit still for five minutes,

374
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:58,350
"you might appreciate
the beauty of..."

375
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:01,192
You and I have been on
completely opposite schedules

376
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,127
for, like, two weeks.

377
00:16:03,196 --> 00:16:04,511
Tuck is at his dad's.

378
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:08,015
So I wasn't planning on
watching the game tonight.

379
00:16:08,617 --> 00:16:09,883
You weren't?

380
00:16:10,937 --> 00:16:12,620
Thank you, Doctor. Nope.

381
00:16:12,689 --> 00:16:14,049
What were you planning to do?

382
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:15,217
I could say it out loud, but...

383
00:16:15,241 --> 00:16:16,674
Here you go.

384
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:19,193
It would be inappropriate
for the workplace,

385
00:16:19,262 --> 00:16:20,844
so I'm just gonna think it.

386
00:16:28,337 --> 00:16:29,577
Oh...

387
00:16:38,681 --> 00:16:40,359
I'm gonna get
out of girls' night.

388
00:16:40,383 --> 00:16:41,383
Mmm-hmm.

389
00:16:43,619 --> 00:16:44,718
I got the donor scans.

390
00:16:44,787 --> 00:16:47,287
Great. Let's see what you got.

391
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:51,992
There.

392
00:16:53,796 --> 00:16:56,446
Bowel looks good, small
intestines, large intestines,

393
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:58,299
and that's a
good-looking pancreas.

394
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:00,179
Look at that on
the liver right there.

395
00:17:00,203 --> 00:17:01,285
Looks like a tumor.

396
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:02,998
That makes him an
unsuitable organ donor.

397
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:06,139
Not necessarily. Could
be a benign adenoma.

398
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:08,170
My patient's been in
for two other transplants,

399
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:09,560
and they both fell through.

400
00:17:09,629 --> 00:17:11,173
He's not gonna live much
longer without a new liver.

401
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:13,097
We could resect it.

402
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:16,033
It's a little unconventional
to operate on a donor,

403
00:17:16,102 --> 00:17:18,262
but there's no reason
why it wouldn't work.

404
00:17:19,005 --> 00:17:20,371
That's a great idea, Bailey.

405
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:21,767
Great idea? You want to put

406
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:24,575
compromised organs
into a transplant recipient

407
00:17:24,644 --> 00:17:26,855
and give your guy cancer
on top of everything else?

408
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:29,980
I think we owe it to my guy to at
least excise the tumor and test it.

409
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,250
I don't agree.

410
00:17:32,318 --> 00:17:36,670
Dr. Sloan, are you arguing
surgical protocol with Dr. Webber?

411
00:17:36,739 --> 00:17:38,506
Dr. Bailey,

412
00:17:38,574 --> 00:17:42,026
are you arguing with the
decision of the Chief of Surgery?

413
00:17:47,266 --> 00:17:48,582
Call UNOS.

414
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:50,462
Tell them this
donor's unsuitable.

415
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:52,926
Put Mr. Sheridan
back on the list.

416
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:04,115
We've put you back
on the transplant list.

417
00:18:04,183 --> 00:18:07,001
And a new set of organs
can come in at any time.

418
00:18:07,069 --> 00:18:10,003
Cut the crap, Dr. Webber.

419
00:18:10,072 --> 00:18:12,039
You and I both know
I'm not gonna make it

420
00:18:12,107 --> 00:18:17,495
to see the sunrise tomorrow,
let alone to stick around

421
00:18:17,564 --> 00:18:20,814
for some other poor,
sad sack to kick it.

422
00:18:20,883 --> 00:18:22,961
Mr. Sheridan, is there
anyone we can call for you,

423
00:18:22,985 --> 00:18:25,197
your family, your
sisters, your friends?

424
00:18:25,221 --> 00:18:27,087
Are you kidding?

425
00:18:27,156 --> 00:18:30,658
Thank God my family's
not around for this.

426
00:18:30,726 --> 00:18:34,578
It's like Lucy with a
football, except it's my life.

427
00:18:34,647 --> 00:18:37,481
It would kill them worse
than the first two times

428
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:39,650
to come in here and
say good-bye to me.

429
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:44,489
We're all alone in
this world, sunshine.

430
00:18:44,557 --> 00:18:47,858
Anybody who tells
you any different is lying

431
00:18:47,927 --> 00:18:50,261
or trying to sell you something.

432
00:18:51,931 --> 00:18:53,681
Now you...

433
00:18:53,749 --> 00:18:56,483
You are the best
doctor I ever had.

434
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:59,703
So don't beat
yourself up about this.

435
00:18:59,772 --> 00:19:01,772
It's done. It's over.

436
00:19:02,608 --> 00:19:04,591
You did everything you could.

437
00:19:06,346 --> 00:19:07,478
No.

438
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:09,875
No, I didn't.

439
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:11,059
Sir.

440
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:14,017
Bailey, your tumor
resection idea was sound.

441
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:16,937
And there was no reason
why those organs wouldn't work.

442
00:19:18,224 --> 00:19:20,457
The donor is still
on life support.

443
00:19:20,526 --> 00:19:22,420
The organ recovery
for the heart and

444
00:19:22,444 --> 00:19:24,306
lungs isn't scheduled
till this afternoon.

445
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:25,474
But Dr. Sloan...

446
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:26,914
You let me deal
with Chief Sloan.

447
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:34,221
When you're the Chief, you
gotta make the hard decisions.

448
00:19:34,289 --> 00:19:36,790
Webber knows that.
It comes with the job.

449
00:19:36,859 --> 00:19:38,299
Who's our first
appointment, Avery?

450
00:19:38,328 --> 00:19:39,988
No one on the schedule, Chief.

451
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,724
That's why you shoulda
called it "Beef with the Chief."

452
00:19:41,748 --> 00:19:43,388
People would've
shown up for that.

453
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:48,769
You got a beef?

454
00:19:48,838 --> 00:19:51,198
Actually, I would really love
to go study for my boards.

455
00:19:51,991 --> 00:19:52,991
No.

456
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,570
I know, I don't have
an appointment,

457
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:56,872
but do you have a
moment to talk about

458
00:19:56,896 --> 00:19:58,296
Jason Cooper's
jaw reconstruction?

459
00:19:58,364 --> 00:20:00,142
That's fine. He's wide
open. Have a seat.

460
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:01,698
There you go.

461
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:04,129
I think I can carve
out of foam a cradle

462
00:20:04,153 --> 00:20:05,664
that holds the patient's
head and neck during surgery,

463
00:20:05,688 --> 00:20:09,089
reducing the chance of
respiratory complication.

464
00:20:09,158 --> 00:20:10,641
That's a good idea.

465
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,220
But you can do
better. Excuse me?

466
00:20:12,244 --> 00:20:13,945
Foam's fine if
nothing goes wrong,

467
00:20:14,013 --> 00:20:15,591
but it won't be flexible enough

468
00:20:15,615 --> 00:20:17,142
if we have to adjust
him mid-surgery.

469
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:18,643
It's a good idea,
but... Are you aware...

470
00:20:18,667 --> 00:20:19,828
I'm aware... Of what?

471
00:20:19,852 --> 00:20:21,530
That that surgery is
taking place at 3:00,

472
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:24,404
and Jason Cooper's
airway needs to be secured.

473
00:20:24,474 --> 00:20:26,574
So rise, Shepherd.

474
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:27,741
Rise.

475
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:31,929
I can't do ladies' night.

476
00:20:31,997 --> 00:20:33,074
Sorry. What?

477
00:20:33,098 --> 00:20:34,331
But we need you.

478
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,052
I can't come
because Ben and I are

479
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:41,689
taking dance
lessons tonight, salsa.

480
00:20:43,309 --> 00:20:44,620
You and Ben... Yeah.

481
00:20:44,644 --> 00:20:46,627
And salsa?

482
00:20:46,696 --> 00:20:48,757
No, you just want to
go home and get laid.

483
00:20:48,781 --> 00:20:51,565
We have a long-standing
salsa appointment tonight,

484
00:20:51,633 --> 00:20:54,418
and... Sorry.
You're on your own.

485
00:20:54,487 --> 00:20:56,332
Right. I bet it's gonna be long.

486
00:20:56,356 --> 00:20:58,183
Mmm-hmm. Real long.

487
00:20:58,207 --> 00:21:00,207
She's almost finished.

488
00:21:00,275 --> 00:21:02,020
She has read all of your
charts and none of mine.

489
00:21:02,044 --> 00:21:03,472
Yeah, I found her.
I brought her here.

490
00:21:03,496 --> 00:21:06,264
Lex, can you take a look
at some of my cases, too?

491
00:21:06,332 --> 00:21:08,866
Or not. I mean, it's
fine if you don't want to.

492
00:21:08,935 --> 00:21:10,817
It's okay. I can. I will...

493
00:21:10,886 --> 00:21:14,638
No, no, no, no, you will not.
Not until she's finished with mine.

494
00:21:14,707 --> 00:21:16,819
Okay, these take
priority, Lexie.

495
00:21:16,843 --> 00:21:18,363
You don't need
Lexie. You got Torres.

496
00:21:18,427 --> 00:21:20,088
They're for Cristina.
She's not even here.

497
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:21,356
Which is why she needs the help.

498
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:22,758
She does not need the help.

499
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:24,293
She just needs to finish
mine. And you know what?

500
00:21:24,317 --> 00:21:25,317
Shh!

501
00:21:29,372 --> 00:21:32,256
Yeah, but you know what?
There is no compromise.

502
00:21:32,325 --> 00:21:34,491
You don't have half a baby.

503
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,725
I don't want one.

504
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:38,195
We live like you want,
and how you want.

505
00:21:38,264 --> 00:21:40,097
You get whatever you want!

506
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:47,354
I didn't realize
how late it got.

507
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:49,723
I know. Me, too.

508
00:21:56,899 --> 00:21:58,332
Okay.

509
00:21:58,401 --> 00:22:01,468
Well, good night.

510
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:04,121
Good night.

511
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:05,968
Thank you again for
saving my friend's life.

512
00:22:05,992 --> 00:22:08,359
Oh, oh... This...
It's just my job.

513
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:15,048
Kiss me.

514
00:22:17,185 --> 00:22:19,185
I'm drunk. I'm drunk.

515
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:20,494
So? Kiss me anyway.

516
00:22:20,523 --> 00:22:22,022
I am married.

517
00:22:22,608 --> 00:22:23,940
So?

518
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:25,976
Kiss me anyway.

519
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:28,012
I can't.

520
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,396
Yes, you can.

521
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:32,833
You...

522
00:22:33,569 --> 00:22:34,835
You're trouble.

523
00:22:35,838 --> 00:22:37,604
You are trouble.

524
00:22:38,374 --> 00:22:39,506
So?

525
00:22:40,242 --> 00:22:41,641
Kiss me anyway.

526
00:23:18,113 --> 00:23:19,346
No.

527
00:23:19,415 --> 00:23:20,914
No.

528
00:23:46,592 --> 00:23:49,738
You've gotta fix this thing
with Cristina and Hunt.

529
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:52,429
Zola. Zola.

530
00:23:52,498 --> 00:23:54,159
What? Don't tell
me nothing's wrong.

531
00:23:54,183 --> 00:23:57,796
Yang has never missed a day at
work because she's been sick, ever.

532
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:59,285
And Sloan as Chief?

533
00:24:00,455 --> 00:24:01,755
He's driving me crazy.

534
00:24:02,658 --> 00:24:03,724
I can't fix it.

535
00:24:03,792 --> 00:24:05,025
Come on.

536
00:24:05,094 --> 00:24:07,077
I can't fix this.

537
00:24:09,031 --> 00:24:10,246
He cheated on her.

538
00:24:10,315 --> 00:24:11,782
What?

539
00:24:11,851 --> 00:24:13,083
When?

540
00:24:13,152 --> 00:24:15,130
I don't know. I don't
know the whole story.

541
00:24:15,154 --> 00:24:16,265
She didn't tell you?

542
00:24:16,289 --> 00:24:17,289
He told me.

543
00:24:17,356 --> 00:24:18,655
Hunt told you?

544
00:24:20,826 --> 00:24:23,105
He told me, but he didn't
really know he was telling me,

545
00:24:23,129 --> 00:24:24,161
but that's how I know.

546
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:25,641
Does Cristina know you know?

547
00:24:25,665 --> 00:24:28,666
She knows. I mean, she
doesn't know, but she knows.

548
00:24:28,734 --> 00:24:29,734
I know she knows.

549
00:24:29,785 --> 00:24:30,979
So don't you want
to talk to her about it?

550
00:24:31,003 --> 00:24:32,381
But I can't talk
about it with her,

551
00:24:32,405 --> 00:24:33,999
because then we
would be talking about it.

552
00:24:34,023 --> 00:24:35,334
Don't you want to talk about it?

553
00:24:35,358 --> 00:24:36,623
Yes, but not like that.

554
00:24:39,695 --> 00:24:41,595
I hope they figure it out.

555
00:24:41,663 --> 00:24:43,308
Because you can't
stand Sloan as your boss?

556
00:24:43,332 --> 00:24:44,831
Among other things, yes.

557
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,166
Zola.

558
00:24:46,235 --> 00:24:48,269
I'm gonna get you.

559
00:25:00,315 --> 00:25:03,915
He does have a point about
stabilizing the spine with foam.

560
00:25:09,175 --> 00:25:10,485
I got your page. What's up?

561
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:13,744
Slight change of plans.
You're taking Sofia tonight.

562
00:25:13,812 --> 00:25:15,012
Yeah. We can't.

563
00:25:15,047 --> 00:25:18,060
No, we got a ladies'
night with Altman.

564
00:25:18,084 --> 00:25:19,717
You're taking
Altman to a chick bar?

565
00:25:19,785 --> 00:25:21,797
It can mean other things.

566
00:25:21,821 --> 00:25:23,331
It's your night with Sofia.

567
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:25,216
I don't know how late I'm
gonna have to be here tonight.

568
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,257
Seriously? Seriously.

569
00:25:27,326 --> 00:25:29,359
I have chief stuff to do.

570
00:25:29,428 --> 00:25:31,461
And you still owe me
for Valentine's Day.

571
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:33,397
Kepner.

572
00:25:33,465 --> 00:25:35,505
Here you go, Doctor. Okay.

573
00:25:36,268 --> 00:25:38,852
Remind me, how long's
it take to do an appy?

574
00:25:38,921 --> 00:25:43,323
If you perf the bowel, then
it takes... It could take hours.

575
00:25:43,392 --> 00:25:45,659
Or if the patient
hemorrhages, or if the patient...

576
00:25:45,727 --> 00:25:48,278
This isn't your boards, Kepner.

577
00:25:48,347 --> 00:25:52,499
How long does it take to
do an appy in the real world?

578
00:25:52,567 --> 00:25:55,163
Forty-five minutes to
an hour and 15, tops.

579
00:25:55,187 --> 00:25:58,021
Then why do Bailey and Grey
have eight hours blocked in OR two?

580
00:25:59,257 --> 00:26:01,892
Maybe it's a really
complicated appy.

581
00:26:03,328 --> 00:26:04,428
Kepner.

582
00:26:06,465 --> 00:26:08,315
Kepner.

583
00:26:08,384 --> 00:26:11,384
Dr. Webber was the Chief
for a really, really long time.

584
00:26:12,504 --> 00:26:14,749
Do not touch that patient!

585
00:26:14,773 --> 00:26:17,624
Dr. Sloan, if you would
just let us do our jobs...

586
00:26:17,693 --> 00:26:19,521
I'm doing my job, Dr. Bailey.

587
00:26:19,545 --> 00:26:21,856
And today my job is to
be the Chief of Surgery,

588
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:25,699
and as the Chief of Surgery, I told
you not to perform this procedure.

589
00:26:25,767 --> 00:26:27,896
So do not touch him.
Take him back to his room.

590
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,201
Put him back on
the transplant list.

591
00:26:33,408 --> 00:26:35,209
See?

592
00:26:35,277 --> 00:26:37,110
I told you this
would never work.

593
00:26:39,915 --> 00:26:41,615
Dr. Webber.

594
00:26:41,684 --> 00:26:42,794
Chief Sloan.

595
00:26:42,818 --> 00:26:44,284
Was I not clear this morning?

596
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:47,453
You mean this?

597
00:26:48,623 --> 00:26:50,440
This is a benign adenoma.

598
00:26:50,509 --> 00:26:52,704
I've been a general
surgeon for almost 30 years.

599
00:26:52,728 --> 00:26:54,772
I know a benign
adenoma when I see one.

600
00:26:54,796 --> 00:26:56,463
I'd stake my career on it.

601
00:26:56,532 --> 00:26:59,244
If there's a tumor in the donor
organs, then they've been compromised.

602
00:26:59,268 --> 00:27:02,236
You know this. I
didn't make those rules.

603
00:27:02,304 --> 00:27:04,204
You're a good doctor,

604
00:27:04,273 --> 00:27:07,774
and you may one day make
a great Chief of Surgery.

605
00:27:07,843 --> 00:27:10,310
But you're a plastic
surgeon, Chief Sloan.

606
00:27:10,379 --> 00:27:11,978
You're a perfectionist.

607
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:15,849
And you want everything by
the rules so it'll end up pretty.

608
00:27:15,917 --> 00:27:17,484
I don't need pretty.

609
00:27:17,553 --> 00:27:19,469
And I don't need perfect.

610
00:27:19,538 --> 00:27:22,105
What I need is for this to work.

611
00:27:22,174 --> 00:27:25,553
And what's gonna make it work
is for me to take out that tumor

612
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:28,945
and put these healthy organs
inside my very sick patient.

613
00:27:29,015 --> 00:27:32,132
It won't be pretty,
but it will work,

614
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,551
and it will keep
my patient alive.

615
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:36,403
Stand down, Chief Sloan.

616
00:27:37,839 --> 00:27:38,839
Stand down.

617
00:27:43,245 --> 00:27:45,485
A little more
suction right here.

618
00:27:49,317 --> 00:27:51,284
Cristina, please.

619
00:27:51,353 --> 00:27:53,120
Open the door, please.

620
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:57,590
Cristina, if you
don't open the door...

621
00:27:59,494 --> 00:28:00,827
Are you okay?

622
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:02,963
Cristina...

623
00:28:03,031 --> 00:28:05,999
Are you hurting
yourself in there?

624
00:28:06,068 --> 00:28:09,236
Cristina, please. I
don't know what to do.

625
00:28:12,341 --> 00:28:14,653
Cristina, if you don't open the
door, I'm gonna have to break it in.

626
00:28:14,677 --> 00:28:17,294
I'm gonna have to, so...

627
00:28:17,346 --> 00:28:19,479
If you're all right,
just open the door.

628
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:23,901
Okay, I'm breaking in the door.

629
00:28:23,969 --> 00:28:26,837
So if you're close to the
door, then just get back,

630
00:28:26,906 --> 00:28:29,973
'cause I'm breaking it
in right now. I am. So...

631
00:28:31,043 --> 00:28:32,825
All right. One...

632
00:28:32,894 --> 00:28:34,160
Two...

633
00:28:34,246 --> 00:28:35,345
Three.

634
00:28:39,785 --> 00:28:41,185
Ouch.

635
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:48,142
Yeah, that was pretty lame.

636
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:50,611
I look like a total...

637
00:28:58,003 --> 00:28:59,152
Cristina?

638
00:29:05,594 --> 00:29:08,746
I have an M.D. and a PhD,

639
00:29:08,814 --> 00:29:11,782
I am a freaking
cardiothoracic surgeon.

640
00:29:14,686 --> 00:29:18,639
I am supposed to be
studying for my boards,

641
00:29:18,707 --> 00:29:20,852
the most important
exam of my life,

642
00:29:20,876 --> 00:29:22,142
and I'm...

643
00:29:23,412 --> 00:29:27,881
And I'm locked in
a bathroom crying.

644
00:29:29,484 --> 00:29:31,084
Because of a boy.

645
00:30:03,252 --> 00:30:05,113
I think it would be
easier if she was

646
00:30:05,137 --> 00:30:06,915
someone you had
fallen in love with.

647
00:30:06,939 --> 00:30:08,016
No, it wouldn't
have been easier.

648
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,160
No, it would.

649
00:30:10,508 --> 00:30:13,310
It would be clear and clean.

650
00:30:15,881 --> 00:30:19,549
You would be leaving me for her.

651
00:30:19,617 --> 00:30:23,854
You would've fallen out of
love with me and in love with her.

652
00:30:23,922 --> 00:30:26,189
When you slept with her,

653
00:30:26,258 --> 00:30:27,568
you wouldn't have
been able to control

654
00:30:27,592 --> 00:30:28,870
yourself because
of all the love.

655
00:30:28,894 --> 00:30:31,944
Cristina, it would
not have been easier.

656
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,194
It was just sex?

657
00:30:36,218 --> 00:30:37,284
It was just sex.

658
00:30:39,487 --> 00:30:40,586
Just once.

659
00:30:45,561 --> 00:30:46,687
I don't understand.

660
00:30:46,711 --> 00:30:47,744
What? What don't you...

661
00:30:47,812 --> 00:30:49,312
I don't understand how you...

662
00:30:51,616 --> 00:30:52,916
I don't understand

663
00:30:54,153 --> 00:30:55,830
why you would sleep
with another woman.

664
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:57,103
Cristina...

665
00:30:59,007 --> 00:31:01,874
I don't know. I...

666
00:31:01,944 --> 00:31:06,046
I was lonely because
we were fighting and...

667
00:31:07,582 --> 00:31:09,127
I was afraid of what
was happening to us,

668
00:31:09,151 --> 00:31:10,850
and I just got drunk

669
00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:13,686
and I did an
incredibly stupid thing.

670
00:31:13,755 --> 00:31:17,691
And people make mistakes. I
make mistakes. You make mistakes.

671
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,327
Okay, if you're gonna

672
00:31:20,395 --> 00:31:22,106
bring up the abortion again...

673
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:23,841
If you're gonna say that
you had sex with someone

674
00:31:23,865 --> 00:31:25,148
because I had an abortion...

675
00:31:25,217 --> 00:31:28,118
I had sex with someone
because I was hurt.

676
00:31:28,170 --> 00:31:29,247
And you wanted to hurt me back?

677
00:31:29,271 --> 00:31:31,488
I don't, Cristina...

678
00:31:34,859 --> 00:31:37,099
You wanted to hurt me back.

679
00:31:50,492 --> 00:31:53,532
Oh, my God. You
wanted to hurt me back.

680
00:31:54,946 --> 00:31:56,491
Mark can't take Sofia tonight.

681
00:31:56,515 --> 00:31:57,581
Or won't.

682
00:31:57,650 --> 00:31:58,650
He can't.

683
00:31:58,717 --> 00:32:00,150
What are we gonna do?

684
00:32:00,218 --> 00:32:01,896
We could have ladies'
night at our place.

685
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,621
Just the two of us,
at home, with Teddy?

686
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:06,523
I hate ladies' night.

687
00:32:06,592 --> 00:32:08,958
It could be great if
we could ditch Teddy.

688
00:32:09,027 --> 00:32:10,944
That's so, so horrible.

689
00:32:11,013 --> 00:32:13,746
Come on. We can
do some salsa dancin'.

690
00:32:15,283 --> 00:32:16,661
But do you think Teddy
would understand?

691
00:32:16,685 --> 00:32:18,329
Yeah, we'll reschedule.
It's not like we're canceling.

692
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:20,803
Are we bad people?
We're bad ladies.

693
00:32:20,872 --> 00:32:22,138
Maybe.

694
00:32:22,741 --> 00:32:24,508
Maybe very bad.

695
00:32:27,863 --> 00:32:29,195
Okay.

696
00:32:30,064 --> 00:32:31,798
Out with the bad.

697
00:32:33,385 --> 00:32:36,152
And in with the good.

698
00:32:37,055 --> 00:32:38,322
On the count of three.

699
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:40,006
Ready. One,

700
00:32:40,075 --> 00:32:42,291
two... Careful.

701
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,726
And three.

702
00:32:45,848 --> 00:32:46,958
Easy. Watch the clamps.

703
00:32:46,982 --> 00:32:48,092
I have the clamps. I got 'em.

704
00:32:48,116 --> 00:32:49,282
All right. Easy, easy, girl.

705
00:32:49,351 --> 00:32:51,084
Okay. Okay.

706
00:32:57,726 --> 00:33:01,894
So the beanbag will stabilize
Mr. Cooper's cervical spine.

707
00:33:01,963 --> 00:33:03,296
And it's flexible enough

708
00:33:03,365 --> 00:33:06,577
that Dr. Warren can intubate
and reposition if he needs to.

709
00:33:06,601 --> 00:33:10,001
Once he intubates, I will
leave the surgery to you.

710
00:33:10,605 --> 00:33:11,871
A beanbag?

711
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:13,217
Inspiration can
come from anywhere.

712
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:15,525
In this case, day care.

713
00:33:16,812 --> 00:33:18,295
You see that?

714
00:33:18,363 --> 00:33:20,998
I plant the seed of innovation,
I nurture it and <i>voila.</i>

715
00:33:21,066 --> 00:33:22,098
You rose.

716
00:33:25,787 --> 00:33:27,754
Am I a fantastic leader or what?

717
00:33:31,543 --> 00:33:33,326
All hail the Chief.

718
00:33:33,394 --> 00:33:34,461
When's Hunt coming back?

719
00:33:34,529 --> 00:33:35,649
Not soon enough.

720
00:33:38,933 --> 00:33:40,044
Thank you, Doctor.

721
00:33:40,068 --> 00:33:41,212
Hey. Hey.

722
00:33:41,236 --> 00:33:42,276
You okay?

723
00:33:42,304 --> 00:33:43,970
Yeah, yeah, I'm good. I just...

724
00:33:44,038 --> 00:33:45,638
I just need some
more coffee, I think.

725
00:33:45,707 --> 00:33:47,051
Listen, if you're
too tired, you know,

726
00:33:47,075 --> 00:33:49,237
we don't have to go out tonight.

727
00:33:49,261 --> 00:33:50,660
Oh.

728
00:33:50,728 --> 00:33:52,028
You don't want to go out?

729
00:33:52,097 --> 00:33:54,191
No, no, no, no. I mean, I
didn't say that I don't wanna...

730
00:33:54,215 --> 00:33:56,375
Oh, my God. When am I
gonna stop freaking people out?

731
00:33:56,418 --> 00:33:58,652
I don't mean to be
the big, sad widow,

732
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,360
and I don't mean to
bring the room down.

733
00:34:00,388 --> 00:34:02,172
I don't want to ruin
other people's fun.

734
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,717
Teddy, I'm just... I
thought you were tired.

735
00:34:03,741 --> 00:34:06,020
So we're super excited
about ladies' night out.

736
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:07,755
It's gonna be fun. Yeah?

737
00:34:07,779 --> 00:34:08,923
Yeah. Okay.

738
00:34:08,947 --> 00:34:10,707
Yay! Yay!

739
00:34:15,403 --> 00:34:17,687
We are bad, selfish people.

740
00:34:17,756 --> 00:34:19,567
A woman is counting on us.

741
00:34:19,591 --> 00:34:21,368
She is leaning on us when she
is feeling vulnerable and alone,

742
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:23,504
and we are talking about
dancing and getting it on

743
00:34:23,528 --> 00:34:25,222
and not even being
halfway decent friends to her

744
00:34:25,246 --> 00:34:26,512
in her time of need.

745
00:34:26,581 --> 00:34:28,831
You were gonna ditch
her so you could get it on?

746
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,194
Where do you think
we got the idea?

747
00:34:30,218 --> 00:34:31,429
I don't know what
you're talking about.

748
00:34:31,453 --> 00:34:33,319
Anyway, look, I only canceled

749
00:34:33,405 --> 00:34:34,849
because I knew the two
of you would be there.

750
00:34:34,873 --> 00:34:36,539
Now what's your excuse?

751
00:34:36,608 --> 00:34:37,685
I wanted to salsa.

752
00:34:37,709 --> 00:34:39,142
No, nobody gets salsa.

753
00:34:39,211 --> 00:34:41,410
We get ladies' night with Teddy.

754
00:34:41,479 --> 00:34:43,173
And you will be there
and you will be there.

755
00:34:43,197 --> 00:34:45,381
I have... No excuses.

756
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:47,651
No excuses.

757
00:34:49,437 --> 00:34:51,338
I read so much.
There's so many charts.

758
00:34:51,406 --> 00:34:55,308
I just got so full, I think
things are falling out.

759
00:34:55,377 --> 00:34:58,411
There's nothing in my brain.

760
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:01,381
Lexie, why aren't you
in the reading room?

761
00:35:01,449 --> 00:35:02,493
I can do it. Okay.

762
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:03,611
I can, let me do...

763
00:35:03,635 --> 00:35:05,229
No. No, no, no,
you're not doing it.

764
00:35:05,253 --> 00:35:07,604
No. No more using my
sister like a database.

765
00:35:07,673 --> 00:35:08,988
We broke her.

766
00:35:09,057 --> 00:35:10,356
It's over. Done.

767
00:35:11,542 --> 00:35:12,542
Done.

768
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:24,804
So I'll come back and get the...

769
00:35:24,873 --> 00:35:26,323
The rest of my
stuff another time.

770
00:35:30,845 --> 00:35:32,144
Okay.

771
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:35,499
Bye.

772
00:35:36,368 --> 00:35:37,567
Bye.

773
00:35:42,758 --> 00:35:44,724
I'll always be in love with you.

774
00:35:46,361 --> 00:35:48,762
You're the love of my life.

775
00:35:49,798 --> 00:35:52,164
I will never love another woman.

776
00:35:54,636 --> 00:35:56,619
You don't even
remember her name.

777
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:06,973
You take care of yourself.

778
00:36:29,938 --> 00:36:31,537
Hi, Neil.

779
00:36:32,807 --> 00:36:34,207
Am I...

780
00:36:34,276 --> 00:36:36,526
Alive? I'm afraid so.

781
00:36:40,949 --> 00:36:43,132
Where is everybody?

782
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:46,686
You didn't tell anyone
you were having surgery.

783
00:36:46,755 --> 00:36:50,390
They didn't call just
to check up on me?

784
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:53,693
You told them not
to several times.

785
00:36:55,297 --> 00:36:57,096
What does that matter?

786
00:36:57,165 --> 00:37:00,405
They're my family. They
should know not to listen to me.

787
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,554
I could've died.

788
00:37:04,623 --> 00:37:06,022
They should've come.

789
00:37:09,594 --> 00:37:12,328
I can't believe that
they didn't come.

790
00:37:16,868 --> 00:37:18,901
Let's call them.

791
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:20,370
Should we call them?

792
00:37:20,439 --> 00:37:21,954
Yeah. Okay?

793
00:37:22,023 --> 00:37:23,440
Yeah. Okay.

794
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:28,639
I got those ginger
cookies for dessert.

795
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:31,709
No, no, no, no dessert. No,
we're having a glass of wine,

796
00:37:31,733 --> 00:37:33,493
plate of food, then
everybody's on their way.

797
00:37:34,302 --> 00:37:35,768
School night.

798
00:37:35,837 --> 00:37:37,381
What'd you tell Ben, you'd
be outta here in like an hour?

799
00:37:37,405 --> 00:37:38,537
Forty-five minutes.

800
00:37:39,941 --> 00:37:41,507
I'm late. I'm sorry.

801
00:37:41,576 --> 00:37:44,444
I couldn't figure out whether
we wanted red or white or rose.

802
00:37:44,513 --> 00:37:46,123
And then I realized, why choose?

803
00:37:46,147 --> 00:37:47,725
I mean, we've got
the whole night.

804
00:37:47,749 --> 00:37:49,048
That we do.

805
00:37:49,116 --> 00:37:51,584
And movies. <i>Dirty
Dancing</i> and <i>Beaches.</i>

806
00:37:56,090 --> 00:37:58,124
Movies.

807
00:38:09,738 --> 00:38:12,058
<i>Cristina, are you there?</i>

808
00:38:15,177 --> 00:38:17,777
I can hear you
breathing. Are you okay?

809
00:38:17,846 --> 00:38:19,045
<i>I'm here.</i>

810
00:38:19,781 --> 00:38:21,547
Are you feeling better?

811
00:38:21,616 --> 00:38:23,482
<i>Yes.</i>

812
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:25,218
<i>I'm better. I...</i>

813
00:38:42,954 --> 00:38:45,455
Cristina...

814
00:38:45,524 --> 00:38:47,651
I know that you don't
want to talk about it,

815
00:38:47,675 --> 00:38:51,111
<i>but I'm here, so...</i>

816
00:38:53,131 --> 00:38:55,531
I just want to stay
on the phone with you

817
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:57,741
until you want to hang up.

818
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:00,186
<i>I'm here.</i>

819
00:39:01,689 --> 00:39:02,922
<i>I'm here.</i>

820
00:39:19,007 --> 00:39:20,618
<i>The human body is made</i>

821
00:39:20,642 --> 00:39:23,443
<i>up of systems
that keep it alive.</i>

822
00:39:23,512 --> 00:39:25,511
<i>There's the one that
keeps you breathing...</i>

823
00:39:29,884 --> 00:39:31,796
<i>And the one that
keeps you standing...</i>

824
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:33,552
Hunt.

825
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:34,820
You feeling better?

826
00:39:35,389 --> 00:39:36,589
What?

827
00:39:36,658 --> 00:39:37,990
The flu.

828
00:39:38,059 --> 00:39:40,309
Oh. Yeah. Yeah. Fine.

829
00:39:41,646 --> 00:39:43,412
You mind if I join you?

830
00:39:43,481 --> 00:39:44,647
Not at all.

831
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:50,536
You know,

832
00:39:50,605 --> 00:39:52,672
Sloan turned out
to be a good Chief.

833
00:39:52,741 --> 00:39:56,142
Sloan? I asked for you or
Webber if you wouldn't do it.

834
00:39:56,211 --> 00:39:59,011
Sloan was Chief? Mark Sloan?

835
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:01,697
Yeah. He wasn't bad.

836
00:40:01,767 --> 00:40:03,466
Don't let him know
I said that, though.

837
00:40:10,876 --> 00:40:12,956
<i>The one that makes you hungry...</i>

838
00:40:19,217 --> 00:40:21,684
<i>And the one that
makes you happy.</i>

839
00:40:23,388 --> 00:40:25,588
<i>They're all connected.</i>

840
00:40:25,657 --> 00:40:27,022
<i>Take a piece out,</i>

841
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:29,191
<i>and everything else falls apart.</i>

842
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,878
So do you know why I brought
you all here this morning?

843
00:40:32,597 --> 00:40:34,330
To help you,

844
00:40:34,399 --> 00:40:36,639
because even though we
all take the boards alone,

845
00:40:36,701 --> 00:40:38,717
if we work together,
we can all pass.

846
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:42,416
<i>And it's only when
our support systems</i>

847
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,407
<i>look like they might fail us...</i>

848
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:48,093
If you're not at the
hospital, you're here.

849
00:40:48,162 --> 00:40:51,380
You sleep here, you eat here.
There are no distractions, no breaks.

850
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:53,216
This is the Grey
method, and it starts now.

851
00:40:55,387 --> 00:40:57,153
<i>That we realize how much</i>

852
00:40:57,222 --> 00:40:58,955
<i>we've depended
on them all along.</i>

853
00:41:08,283 --> 00:41:10,816
I'm gonna fail my
boards. I need to study.

854
00:41:12,587 --> 00:41:13,986
Come on in.
