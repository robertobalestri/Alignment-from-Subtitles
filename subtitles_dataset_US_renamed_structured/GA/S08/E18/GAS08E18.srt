1
00:00:05,572 --> 00:00:09,691
You liked the tile and
the master bedroom suite?

2
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,822
And you like the way the French
doors open out to the deck?

3
00:00:11,846 --> 00:00:13,511
Yes, I love everything so far.

4
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:15,700
I especially love that I
didn't have to do anything.

5
00:00:15,732 --> 00:00:16,748
Meow.

6
00:00:16,816 --> 00:00:17,936
"Meow." That's right, Zola.

7
00:00:17,984 --> 00:00:19,951
That's what a cat says.

8
00:00:20,021 --> 00:00:21,553
Honestly, when
the house is done,

9
00:00:21,621 --> 00:00:23,639
just bring me out
for the big reveal.

10
00:00:23,707 --> 00:00:24,784
You want a big reveal?

11
00:00:24,808 --> 00:00:25,808
I want a big reveal.

12
00:00:25,893 --> 00:00:27,209
Rawr!

13
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:30,712
Good, Zola. "Rawr."
That's what a lion says.

14
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:37,242
Is that a... That's a lion.

15
00:00:41,409 --> 00:00:43,909
<i>We have a phrase
in the operating room,</i>

16
00:00:43,977 --> 00:00:46,428
<i>"Don't pet the lion."</i>

17
00:00:46,496 --> 00:00:50,215
<i>It means, no matter
how nice a tumor looks,</i>

18
00:00:50,284 --> 00:00:53,585
<i>how small it is, how
perfect its margins may be...</i>

19
00:00:56,656 --> 00:00:58,757
Cristina, it's been a week.

20
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:03,027
At some point, we have to talk.

21
00:01:03,096 --> 00:01:05,630
<i>It's still a tumor,
it's still dangerous,</i>

22
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:07,482
<i>and it can bite.</i>

23
00:01:07,551 --> 00:01:09,033
It'll be weird at first.

24
00:01:09,103 --> 00:01:11,520
Believe me, you'll
feel like an idiot.

25
00:01:11,588 --> 00:01:14,556
But the words can give
you closure and strength.

26
00:01:14,625 --> 00:01:16,574
So I want you each later to

27
00:01:16,643 --> 00:01:19,645
find a private moment and
just say the words aloud.

28
00:01:19,713 --> 00:01:21,413
"I am a widow."

29
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:23,849
Gretchen?

30
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:27,536
It was just so sudden.

31
00:01:27,604 --> 00:01:29,805
Jason was fine,
and then one day,

32
00:01:29,873 --> 00:01:31,634
they said he had some blockages,

33
00:01:31,658 --> 00:01:33,553
minor congestive heart failure,

34
00:01:33,577 --> 00:01:36,228
and then he died, and I...

35
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:42,500
I'm sorry.

36
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:45,297
But blockages with
congestive heart failure?

37
00:01:45,321 --> 00:01:47,166
I mean, do you want to
know what that really means?

38
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:49,235
Your husband's
arteries were clogged.

39
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:51,988
I mean, he probably was
lucky he lasted as long as he did,

40
00:01:52,012 --> 00:01:54,663
because his heart was working
overtime to pump enough blood

41
00:01:54,732 --> 00:01:56,893
to his brain, let alone
the rest of his body,

42
00:01:56,917 --> 00:01:58,561
which ate away the heart muscle

43
00:01:58,585 --> 00:02:01,052
till the ventricular
wall was paper thin

44
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:03,221
and barely contracting.

45
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:06,775
Because just to be clear,
there is no such thing

46
00:02:06,844 --> 00:02:09,228
as minor congestive
heart failure.

47
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:11,512
A patient with
symptoms that severe?

48
00:02:11,582 --> 00:02:13,799
They're a dead man walking.

49
00:02:18,455 --> 00:02:21,206
A lion? An actual lion?

50
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:22,986
Looking at me like I was lunch.

51
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:26,211
Are you sure it wasn't a mountain
lion, or maybe a well-fed cat?

52
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:27,712
I was staring at Simba.

53
00:02:27,781 --> 00:02:29,208
Grey, you're on my service.

54
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:30,899
See you. Hey.

55
00:02:30,968 --> 00:02:33,101
I saw a lion today,
walking across the street.

56
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:34,397
Derek and I were coming
back from the house,

57
00:02:34,421 --> 00:02:35,916
and it was just standing
there in the street.

58
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,217
Cristina's not talking to me.

59
00:02:37,241 --> 00:02:38,651
Okay, how come no one
is concerned about the fact

60
00:02:38,675 --> 00:02:40,220
that I saw a lion
walking around Seattle?

61
00:02:40,244 --> 00:02:41,404
Sorry. I was just...

62
00:02:41,445 --> 00:02:42,928
You can't force
Cristina to open up.

63
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,373
You have to just
let her come to you.

64
00:02:44,397 --> 00:02:45,637
In the meantime, look at this.

65
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:49,718
Animal Control came.
One dart, and he was down.

66
00:02:49,787 --> 00:02:52,253
It walked across the
road, right in front of us.

67
00:02:52,322 --> 00:02:54,856
I feel like Julia and I
are at a crossroads.

68
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:56,508
It's been five months.

69
00:02:56,577 --> 00:02:58,321
Maybe it's time to take the
next step and ask her to move in.

70
00:02:58,345 --> 00:03:00,779
Did you hear what I said?

71
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:01,880
It was a lion.

72
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:05,634
You like Julia, right?

73
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:15,093
Dr. Webber.

74
00:03:15,162 --> 00:03:17,006
Don't you have a gallbladder
scheduled for this morning?

75
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,014
Hendricks is doing it.

76
00:03:19,082 --> 00:03:20,693
You heard about
the lion mauling.

77
00:03:20,717 --> 00:03:22,183
Came down here to claim it

78
00:03:22,252 --> 00:03:24,297
before anybody else
could get their hands on it.

79
00:03:24,321 --> 00:03:27,055
I am down here for
those in need, Avery.

80
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:29,224
I am here to be of
service to human kind.

81
00:03:29,293 --> 00:03:31,204
Yeah, well, you could be
of service to human kind

82
00:03:31,228 --> 00:03:33,509
in OR 3 with that gallbladder.

83
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,133
Try it, son.

84
00:03:39,202 --> 00:03:40,468
Try and challenge me.

85
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:52,464
Thirty-five-year-old male,
body covered in claw marks

86
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:54,211
and an arm that
looks like a chew toy.

87
00:03:54,235 --> 00:03:57,418
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
My arm. I can't feel my arm.

88
00:03:57,488 --> 00:03:58,932
Don't worry. I'm
gonna take care of you.

89
00:03:58,956 --> 00:04:00,122
So am I.

90
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:02,407
Naomi. What happened to Naomi?

91
00:04:02,476 --> 00:04:03,870
Did the lion eat my girlfriend?

92
00:04:03,894 --> 00:04:06,139
These wounds are deep,
Avery. Page Sloan and Torres.

93
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:08,063
Or you can page
Sloan and Torres.

94
00:04:08,131 --> 00:04:10,515
Well, somebody page
Sloan and Torres right now!

95
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:12,596
Thirty-two-year-old female,
nasty bites to the neck,

96
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,231
and her abdomen's
been eviscerated.

97
00:04:14,255 --> 00:04:15,553
Kirby. Where's Kirby?

98
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:19,174
Ma'am, my name is Dr. Bailey.
You are at the hospital.

99
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:21,509
Transferring on one, two, three.

100
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:23,890
Okay, I need to
look at this neck.

101
00:04:23,914 --> 00:04:25,213
What about Kirby?

102
00:04:25,282 --> 00:04:27,110
All right, let's call for
an OR, and page Hunt.

103
00:04:27,134 --> 00:04:29,412
I need to know if Kirby's
okay. Did he get hurt?

104
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:30,756
Can you also find out the status

105
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:31,964
of the gentleman
who came in with her?

106
00:04:31,988 --> 00:04:33,438
No, no. That's Paul.

107
00:04:33,507 --> 00:04:35,547
I want to know
about Kirby, my lion.

108
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,028
So what, it escaped,
like from the zoo?

109
00:04:40,097 --> 00:04:41,841
No, someone's house.
The thing was a pet.

110
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:43,398
What? Yeah.

111
00:04:43,467 --> 00:04:45,167
I went to a grief group.

112
00:04:45,235 --> 00:04:46,584
You went to a grief group?

113
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:50,022
Callie! You went to
a grief group. Yay.

114
00:04:50,074 --> 00:04:51,890
That's... No, not "yay."

115
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,252
Bad. Dr. Altman.

116
00:04:53,276 --> 00:04:55,777
I'm ready to get started
on your stem cell project.

117
00:04:55,846 --> 00:04:57,596
See? I mean, who
needs a grief group?

118
00:04:57,664 --> 00:05:00,415
I am doing cutting-edge
stem cell research.

119
00:05:00,483 --> 00:05:01,933
I'm looking toward the future,

120
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:03,785
not dwelling on the past. Right?

121
00:05:03,853 --> 00:05:05,520
Sorry to interrupt.

122
00:05:05,589 --> 00:05:10,442
It's my last day, and I just
wanted to say good-bye.

123
00:05:10,511 --> 00:05:13,077
Well, it's been great
working with you.

124
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,680
Good luck back east.

125
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:19,768
Good-bye. Bye.

126
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:23,701
Is it okay if I give you a hug?

127
00:05:24,207 --> 00:05:26,040
Why wouldn't it be okay?

128
00:05:26,109 --> 00:05:27,519
Yeah, of course it is.
Come here, Colleen.

129
00:05:27,543 --> 00:05:29,043
Give me a hug.

130
00:05:39,773 --> 00:05:42,174
I think he grew.
Doesn't he look longer?

131
00:05:42,242 --> 00:05:43,386
Sure. He's gonna play hoops.

132
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:46,177
I'm serious. You
should measure him.

133
00:05:46,246 --> 00:05:47,390
He shot up an inch overnight.

134
00:05:47,414 --> 00:05:49,113
I gotta change his dressing.

135
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:51,933
You changed his
dressing an hour ago.

136
00:05:52,002 --> 00:05:53,668
Please measure him.

137
00:05:53,736 --> 00:05:55,737
I'm using my puppy dog eyes.

138
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,723
He needs a new tape measure.

139
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:09,117
I need off this case. Put
Kepner on it or something.

140
00:06:09,203 --> 00:06:10,713
This is about
the lion, isn't it?

141
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:11,765
You want to go see the victims.

142
00:06:11,789 --> 00:06:13,388
I don't blame you.

143
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:15,468
All right. Go on. Go get a
look and then come back.

144
00:06:15,492 --> 00:06:16,753
And take pictures
while you're there.

145
00:06:16,777 --> 00:06:19,711
This isn't about the lion.
This is about Morgan.

146
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:23,264
She's into me.

147
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:25,766
Karev, we work with sick kids

148
00:06:25,835 --> 00:06:28,381
and then we develop close
relationships with their parents.

149
00:06:28,405 --> 00:06:30,216
It's normal. You just
need to deal with it.

150
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,151
And you... You
put up boundaries.

151
00:06:32,175 --> 00:06:35,677
I'm trying, but she acts
like we're, you know...

152
00:06:35,745 --> 00:06:38,396
I can't be this
kid's doctor, okay?

153
00:06:38,465 --> 00:06:39,705
Alex, he smiled.

154
00:06:39,749 --> 00:06:42,567
You gotta come
see. He's smiling.

155
00:06:42,635 --> 00:06:45,820
Okay, you want off my service,
you can be off my service.

156
00:06:45,889 --> 00:06:48,023
But, Alex, you better mean it.

157
00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:49,441
I mean it.

158
00:06:50,277 --> 00:06:51,909
Okay. I mean it.

159
00:06:54,364 --> 00:06:56,375
The patient's belly
is ripped open.

160
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:57,527
Spleen and
intestines are exposed.

161
00:06:57,551 --> 00:06:58,900
What happened?

162
00:06:58,968 --> 00:07:00,880
She has a lion for a
pet is what happened.

163
00:07:00,904 --> 00:07:02,448
It tried to eat her
and then it got away,

164
00:07:02,472 --> 00:07:03,999
and it probably tried
to eat other people

165
00:07:04,023 --> 00:07:05,440
because it is a lion.

166
00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:07,709
Who has a lion
living in their house?

167
00:07:07,777 --> 00:07:09,489
I'll tell you who has a
lion living in their house.

168
00:07:09,513 --> 00:07:11,278
A crazy person does.

169
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:12,814
Now because she's crazy

170
00:07:12,883 --> 00:07:15,260
doesn't mean she doesn't
deserve excellent care.

171
00:07:15,284 --> 00:07:17,702
In fact, we're going to
save that crazy lady's life

172
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:19,331
just so I can tell
her she's crazy.

173
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:21,022
Got it?

174
00:07:21,091 --> 00:07:22,211
Told you I saw a lion.

175
00:07:26,229 --> 00:07:28,647
I know you know.

176
00:07:28,715 --> 00:07:30,331
Is this about Cristina again?

177
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,433
She walks away every
time I try to talk to her,

178
00:07:32,502 --> 00:07:34,869
so just let her know
how sorry I am.

179
00:07:34,938 --> 00:07:38,573
I wish I could take it back,
if I could. It was just sex.

180
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:40,803
Just stop. I would love to stop.

181
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:42,593
I mean, I don't
relish discussing

182
00:07:42,663 --> 00:07:45,430
my own personal
failings with you, but...

183
00:07:45,499 --> 00:07:47,744
We're going to pretend this
conversation never happened.

184
00:07:47,768 --> 00:07:48,811
Okay? No! Meredith...

185
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:50,151
I mean it.

186
00:07:51,621 --> 00:07:53,381
Damn it. Now I
have to scrub again.

187
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:08,197
Do you know anything about
Arizona and that nurse Colleen?

188
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:10,466
Were they a thing
before she met me?

189
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,723
Ortho nurse Colleen?

190
00:08:11,792 --> 00:08:13,636
Yeah. There was a good-bye
hug that lingered too long.

191
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,959
That would explain it.

192
00:08:15,028 --> 00:08:17,762
I been trying to get her
naked for three years.

193
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:19,391
Anyway, she never said anything,

194
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:20,927
and I work with
Colleen every day.

195
00:08:20,951 --> 00:08:22,628
Do you think she has other exes

196
00:08:22,652 --> 00:08:23,746
here in the hospital? Probably.

197
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:25,086
Ugh.

198
00:08:25,155 --> 00:08:27,939
Quit it. Stop thinking
about the hot ortho nurse.

199
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:30,342
Wait. You... You
think she's hot?

200
00:08:32,028 --> 00:08:34,562
I could see it in those eyes.

201
00:08:34,631 --> 00:08:38,416
Those eyes said, "You are
meat," and in that moment,

202
00:08:38,484 --> 00:08:40,217
I believed him.

203
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:41,526
What happened then?

204
00:08:41,588 --> 00:08:44,089
Then he lunged,
and I just reacted.

205
00:08:44,157 --> 00:08:47,258
I shoved my arm right into his
mouth. Who the hell who does that?

206
00:08:47,327 --> 00:08:49,122
Who the hell feeds
himself to a lion?

207
00:08:49,146 --> 00:08:50,979
I'm kinda wondering
the same thing.

208
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:54,977
What do we got? Deep
animal claw laceration

209
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:56,795
extending down the
left side of the body.

210
00:08:56,819 --> 00:08:58,319
And there's your arm.

211
00:08:58,388 --> 00:09:01,055
Yeah, that's what you
expect when you hear "lion."

212
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:02,852
I bet it's nice to
know what to expect

213
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:05,993
instead of showing up at your
girlfriend's house for the first time

214
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:07,256
and being greeted at the door

215
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,674
by the freakin'
king of the jungle.

216
00:09:08,698 --> 00:09:10,276
She never bothered to
mention she had a pet lion?

217
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,278
Seems like something that
ought to come up on a first date.

218
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:14,001
Right? She told
me she had a cat.

219
00:09:14,087 --> 00:09:15,887
A big cat, and I'm allergic,

220
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:19,174
so I took an antihistamine
before I left the house.

221
00:09:21,711 --> 00:09:25,180
Yeah. You should
have brought a bullwhip.

222
00:09:25,265 --> 00:09:28,916
So I dissect out and remove
the animal cadaver hearts.

223
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:30,829
Then I insert them
with the catheters

224
00:09:30,853 --> 00:09:33,087
and begin injecting
them with the solvent.

225
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:34,973
Correct. And why do we do that?

226
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:37,453
To drain the hearts of
their existing cardiac cells

227
00:09:37,477 --> 00:09:40,494
so all that's left is their
extracellular matrix.

228
00:09:40,581 --> 00:09:43,815
Like stripping a house
down to its frame only.

229
00:09:43,884 --> 00:09:46,434
We are scrubbing away
cells of hearts, Cristina,

230
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:48,003
actual hearts.

231
00:09:48,071 --> 00:09:51,306
We are wiping them
clean till they're blank.

232
00:09:52,042 --> 00:09:54,108
And then in theory,

233
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:55,737
when we inject
them with stem cells...

234
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:58,336
They'll live again.

235
00:09:59,398 --> 00:10:01,115
Let's grow ourselves
some new hearts.

236
00:10:02,869 --> 00:10:05,936
Dr. Altman, I traded with
Kepner. I'm on your service today.

237
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:07,138
Are you up on my patients?

238
00:10:07,206 --> 00:10:09,046
Uh...

239
00:10:09,426 --> 00:10:11,125
Karev? Karev, can you focus?

240
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:12,660
Yeah. Sorry.

241
00:10:15,248 --> 00:10:17,532
That's the ER. Let's go.

242
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,633
Happy scrubbing.

243
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:38,403
You immobilize the
aneurysm and place the clip.

244
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:39,565
Wait. I'm clipping the aneurysm?

245
00:10:39,589 --> 00:10:41,338
What if it ruptures?

246
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:43,858
I clip proximal and
distal to the aneurysm.

247
00:10:43,927 --> 00:10:45,655
What if you damage
the perforating vessels?

248
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:48,039
I throw a temporary
clip on the parent artery.

249
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,394
It's okay if you don't
want me to do it.

250
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:55,336
I know that I really
messed up last week.

251
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:56,871
Yes, you did.

252
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:58,618
But you're still a student,
and this is how you learn.

253
00:10:58,642 --> 00:10:59,658
Any other questions?

254
00:11:02,362 --> 00:11:04,979
Are you gonna tell Mark
to move in with Julia?

255
00:11:05,047 --> 00:11:07,198
I mean, what do they
even really talk about?

256
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:10,101
You know, she sews
eyeballs for a living. It's gross.

257
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,280
I mean, plus, she
has really thin hair,

258
00:11:11,304 --> 00:11:13,204
which can be a sign
of early menopause.

259
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:16,318
We don't talk
about stuff like this.

260
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:18,093
We don't talk
about stuff like this.

261
00:11:18,161 --> 00:11:19,410
I will see you in pre-op.

262
00:11:21,497 --> 00:11:22,975
You're not using the oil.

263
00:11:22,999 --> 00:11:24,760
Alex uses his oil when
Tommy's distressed.

264
00:11:24,784 --> 00:11:26,095
It keeps him from desaturating.

265
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:27,697
His SATs are really low.
I don't think the oil is...

266
00:11:27,721 --> 00:11:28,987
Just use the oil.

267
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:30,104
Can we page Dr. Robbins?

268
00:11:30,173 --> 00:11:31,366
No, page Dr. Karev.

269
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:33,390
Alex... Page Robbins now!

270
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:36,160
Can you describe the pain?

271
00:11:36,229 --> 00:11:38,295
I don't know. It just...

272
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:40,244
It's like a...

273
00:11:41,118 --> 00:11:42,917
It's crushing me,

274
00:11:42,986 --> 00:11:44,302
and I can't shake it.

275
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:46,404
Hand me the EKG.

276
00:11:46,473 --> 00:11:48,484
It looks like anterolateral MI.

277
00:11:48,508 --> 00:11:49,974
We almost didn't come in.

278
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:51,921
We're only in
town till tomorrow.

279
00:11:51,945 --> 00:11:54,195
We're catching a
cruise for Alaska.

280
00:11:55,682 --> 00:11:58,266
Mr. Carroll, you're
experiencing a heart attack.

281
00:11:58,334 --> 00:12:01,569
We need to take you up to
the cath lab for an angioplasty.

282
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:04,439
Can you tell me what you were
doing when you felt the chest pain?

283
00:12:04,508 --> 00:12:08,342
We just went out to walk
around our bed and breakfast,

284
00:12:08,411 --> 00:12:10,995
and it was like a piano fell

285
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:12,731
onto my chest.

286
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:14,365
So you were walking.

287
00:12:14,434 --> 00:12:15,812
You weren't running
or anything else

288
00:12:15,836 --> 00:12:17,276
that might have
triggered the pain?

289
00:12:19,623 --> 00:12:20,822
Well...

290
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:26,127
We saw a lion.

291
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:28,078
Yeah.

292
00:12:29,615 --> 00:12:30,748
Hey.

293
00:12:30,817 --> 00:12:32,895
So that was a little awkward.

294
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:34,329
Don't you think, that
thing with Colleen?

295
00:12:34,353 --> 00:12:36,887
How she was... She
got so emotional.

296
00:12:36,957 --> 00:12:38,434
Almost seems like
you guys were a thing.

297
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:40,235
Yeah, she gets
like that. Oh, really?

298
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:41,537
She gets like that, like
you know how she gets,

299
00:12:41,561 --> 00:12:42,938
like you were a thing? Callie.

300
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:45,174
What? It's not... What? I'm
just asking. It's not a big deal.

301
00:12:45,198 --> 00:12:48,733
We were. We were a little bit
of a thing a very long time ago.

302
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,380
Seems like something
you would've mentioned.

303
00:12:51,404 --> 00:12:53,204
Well, it didn't
even occur to me.

304
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:54,584
Have you dated other
people in the hospital

305
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:55,985
it hasn't occurred to
you to tell me about?

306
00:12:56,009 --> 00:12:57,537
Okay, you know what?
We're not doing this.

307
00:12:57,561 --> 00:13:00,445
No, it's totally fine. I mean,
I'll tell you about my exes.

308
00:13:00,514 --> 00:13:01,829
I know about your exes.

309
00:13:01,898 --> 00:13:02,975
Not all of them. You
don't know about Karev.

310
00:13:02,999 --> 00:13:04,715
Karev. I know about Karev.

311
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:07,151
Look, just give me
a number. Ballpark.

312
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:09,503
What, five? Ten? Hundred?

313
00:13:09,572 --> 00:13:11,067
Okay, that's the
NICU. I have to go.

314
00:13:11,091 --> 00:13:12,385
No, no, no, no, no.
You can't just go.

315
00:13:12,409 --> 00:13:13,869
I'm sorry, but the babies,
they need me, so...

316
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:14,925
Arizona...

317
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:16,539
I'm sorry. Wait.
Wait. What... "Waah.

318
00:13:16,563 --> 00:13:18,441
"Dr. Robbins, please help us.
Waah." Just give me a number.

319
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:20,305
Just give me a number.
Just give me a number.

320
00:13:21,617 --> 00:13:24,251
One or two, okay?
That's... That's it.

321
00:13:24,904 --> 00:13:26,270
One or two.

322
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:30,041
That's not so bad.

323
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:31,809
Maybe she should've
gotten a dog.

324
00:13:31,878 --> 00:13:33,494
A dog fetches balls.

325
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:35,496
Maybe, you know, a rascally dog,

326
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:36,698
he chews shoes.

327
00:13:36,766 --> 00:13:38,615
But he doesn't
eviscerate your spleen.

328
00:13:38,685 --> 00:13:42,169
Yeah, and don't say it's
because you love lions so much.

329
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:43,687
If you love lions,

330
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:46,574
you wouldn't want it
to live in your home.

331
00:13:46,642 --> 00:13:51,446
You would want that lion to roam
freely in the jungle with other lions

332
00:13:51,514 --> 00:13:55,200
where they can eviscerate
the spleens of Gazelles.

333
00:13:55,268 --> 00:13:56,935
That's what lions eat, gazelles?

334
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:58,569
I think I saw that on a show

335
00:13:58,638 --> 00:14:03,157
where they were
chasing a herd of gazelles.

336
00:14:03,226 --> 00:14:08,329
Have I offended someone?
'Cause it's awfully quiet in here.

337
00:14:08,398 --> 00:14:12,400
Well, don't tell me you own an
exotic pet that I don't know about.

338
00:14:12,469 --> 00:14:13,996
Grey, you living with a monkey?

339
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,281
Please don't tell me
you're living with a monkey.

340
00:14:15,305 --> 00:14:16,521
No. No monkeys.

341
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:18,222
Hunt?

342
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:20,691
No. Cristina doesn't
believe in pets.

343
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,560
Cristina doesn't
believe in a lot of things.

344
00:14:28,718 --> 00:14:30,084
Okay, then.

345
00:14:30,987 --> 00:14:32,219
Suction.

346
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:40,127
I'm sorry. Explain it again.

347
00:14:40,196 --> 00:14:43,914
During the angioplasty,
Mr. Carroll had another heart attack.

348
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:46,078
We placed a balloon
pump to stabilize him,

349
00:14:46,102 --> 00:14:47,813
but that only buys
us a little time.

350
00:14:47,837 --> 00:14:51,038
They're gonna have
to do surgery, Emma.

351
00:14:51,107 --> 00:14:53,107
But he's going to be okay?

352
00:14:53,175 --> 00:14:56,071
If we can perform a
coronary artery bypass soon,

353
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:57,990
I'm hopeful that
we've caught it in time.

354
00:14:58,014 --> 00:14:59,814
I am so sorry, Em.

355
00:14:59,883 --> 00:15:02,784
You've been waiting
for this trip 50 years.

356
00:15:04,387 --> 00:15:06,370
This cruise was a gift

357
00:15:06,439 --> 00:15:08,939
from our kids for
our anniversary.

358
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:10,753
And now I've messed it all up.

359
00:15:10,777 --> 00:15:12,676
You didn't mess anything up.

360
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:15,929
You wanted to see those
humpback whales so bad.

361
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:17,665
Forget the whales.

362
00:15:17,733 --> 00:15:20,317
We came
face-to-face with a lion.

363
00:15:20,386 --> 00:15:22,637
Yes, we did.

364
00:15:22,705 --> 00:15:25,105
It's already a
heck of a vacation.

365
00:15:26,142 --> 00:15:27,708
Yes, it is.

366
00:15:30,563 --> 00:15:32,763
Happy anniversary, Martin.

367
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:35,949
Say that to me tomorrow.

368
00:15:43,793 --> 00:15:45,504
Make sure his
labs are up to date,

369
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:48,062
and then we'll take
him up to pre-op.

370
00:15:49,932 --> 00:15:51,172
What is wrong with you?

371
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:55,019
I know... I know
that we don't...

372
00:15:55,088 --> 00:15:56,621
We don't talk about this stuff.

373
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:58,972
Okay? But I kinda need
to talk about this stuff,

374
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,136
because what if I don't and
then I miss an opportunity

375
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,938
to appeal to my big brother
about, you know, what...

376
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,445
What if Mark is my soul mate?

377
00:16:04,513 --> 00:16:06,391
I am not your best
friend right now, Lexie.

378
00:16:06,415 --> 00:16:08,293
I am not your big brother.
I am your attending,

379
00:16:08,317 --> 00:16:10,557
and what I need is my resident.

380
00:16:12,739 --> 00:16:14,205
You're right.

381
00:16:14,874 --> 00:16:16,407
I'm sorry. I...

382
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:19,410
I am your resident. Good.

383
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:21,106
Make sure our
patient is prepped.

384
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:22,813
You have an aneurysm to clip.

385
00:16:37,147 --> 00:16:39,180
We came to see the hearts.

386
00:16:39,715 --> 00:16:40,982
This blows.

387
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:42,127
Yang's growing organs,

388
00:16:42,151 --> 00:16:43,471
and I'm stuck
patching up grandpa.

389
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,182
Is that Morgan again? Why
don't you just answer her already?

390
00:16:46,206 --> 00:16:47,988
I've gotta be a
dead fricking mouse.

391
00:16:48,057 --> 00:16:50,136
Cold and dead, okay? I
mean, that's what she needs.

392
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,943
All day, I'm trying to back
off, and all she does is...

393
00:16:54,497 --> 00:16:56,017
See? Hey, you can do this.

394
00:16:56,082 --> 00:16:58,043
All right? You are
good at being a douche,

395
00:16:58,067 --> 00:17:00,029
and that's just, what, one step
away from being cold and dead?

396
00:17:00,053 --> 00:17:01,585
I mean, right, Yang?

397
00:17:03,239 --> 00:17:05,183
See what she's doing?
That's what you need to do.

398
00:17:05,207 --> 00:17:06,891
Do that. Do what she's doing.

399
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,675
Hey, did you guys
hear about a lion lady?

400
00:17:08,744 --> 00:17:10,089
Yeah. Her boyfriend
was the appetizer,

401
00:17:10,113 --> 00:17:11,891
and he wanted mommy for dinner.

402
00:17:11,915 --> 00:17:16,317
I feel bad for her. Okay,
she's just a girl with a pet.

403
00:17:16,385 --> 00:17:18,468
You know, she probably
had some nice friends once,

404
00:17:18,521 --> 00:17:21,455
and maybe even a nice guy, and
then those friends moved away,

405
00:17:21,524 --> 00:17:23,290
the guy started living
with somebody else,

406
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,559
and then her family
probably abandoned her

407
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:27,639
leaving her alone to rot in an
attic somewhere with her cat,

408
00:17:27,663 --> 00:17:29,880
her big jungle cat,

409
00:17:29,949 --> 00:17:32,933
who was sitting in the
corner, just licking his paws

410
00:17:33,002 --> 00:17:36,070
just wanting to eat
her stupid face off.

411
00:17:39,926 --> 00:17:41,654
Look, this is a scientific
lab, not a lunchroom,

412
00:17:41,678 --> 00:17:42,918
so everyone out right now.

413
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:45,430
Cold and dead.

414
00:17:50,286 --> 00:17:51,719
Tommy's contrast study shows

415
00:17:51,788 --> 00:17:55,690
that his sepsis is due
to an ileocolic fistula.

416
00:17:55,758 --> 00:17:57,775
So do the surgery.

417
00:17:57,844 --> 00:17:59,911
He has a bleed,
and he's developed

418
00:17:59,979 --> 00:18:01,662
a post-hemorrhagic
hydrocephalus.

419
00:18:01,731 --> 00:18:03,130
He has ROP.

420
00:18:03,199 --> 00:18:07,134
He's at risk for cerebral
palsy, blindness, deafness,

421
00:18:07,203 --> 00:18:11,488
inability to walk or feed
himself, cognitive disabilities...

422
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:13,369
I don't see how this
surgery changes that.

423
00:18:13,393 --> 00:18:15,170
It doesn't, but it's invasive.

424
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:16,705
I mean, there's a
chance it won't work,

425
00:18:16,729 --> 00:18:18,456
and he'll need more
surgeries. Yeah, I know that.

426
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,526
I have been here dealing
with this for a while.

427
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:23,150
I know more about
this stuff than you do.

428
00:18:23,219 --> 00:18:24,413
Where... Where is Alex?

429
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:25,837
He's on another case.

430
00:18:25,905 --> 00:18:28,705
I think that you need to
consider your other option.

431
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:31,542
If we don't escalate care...

432
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:34,394
Have they taught you
what AND means yet?

433
00:18:36,366 --> 00:18:37,648
Allowing natural death.

434
00:18:42,839 --> 00:18:45,279
We're... We're not...
We're not there yet.

435
00:18:46,408 --> 00:18:49,660
Things are
deteriorating significantly.

436
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,808
You think that's
what I should do?

437
00:18:52,832 --> 00:18:55,416
I think that you
need to consider

438
00:18:55,484 --> 00:18:58,035
what kind of life you
want for your son.

439
00:18:58,103 --> 00:19:01,005
Is it okay for him to
be in pain every day?

440
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:03,457
Is it okay if he
needs a feeding tube

441
00:19:03,525 --> 00:19:04,565
for the rest of his life?

442
00:19:04,627 --> 00:19:08,145
Is it okay if he can't run,

443
00:19:08,214 --> 00:19:09,429
climb, or crawl?

444
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:16,120
If you want the
surgery, we'll do it.

445
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:19,823
But if you decide
that enough is enough,

446
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:21,792
then we'll support
that choice, too.

447
00:19:27,349 --> 00:19:28,782
Hey.

448
00:19:28,851 --> 00:19:31,385
Arizona just taught
me what AND is.

449
00:19:31,454 --> 00:19:33,770
I guess my med school
education's not dead yet.

450
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:52,623
Imagine.

451
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:56,827
The power it takes to
cause injuries like these.

452
00:19:56,896 --> 00:19:59,329
A flick of your wrist, and...

453
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:00,976
Nope. You know
what these injuries are?

454
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,100
This is natural
selection at work.

455
00:20:03,169 --> 00:20:04,346
I mean, the guy was an idiot.

456
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:06,181
I don't care how
desperate you are for sex,

457
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,683
if a chick tells you she
wants you to meet her cat,

458
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:09,139
you run fast.

459
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,953
He was blindsided by
someone he trusted.

460
00:20:10,977 --> 00:20:12,838
You never know how you're
gonna react when that happens.

461
00:20:12,862 --> 00:20:15,228
What did you say
to Robbins? Hmm?

462
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:17,309
Nothing. I just asked
her how many other exes

463
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:19,444
she has in the hospital.
She said one or two.

464
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:20,788
I can live with
one or two, right?

465
00:20:23,489 --> 00:20:24,699
What was that? Why did he cough?

466
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:26,373
Don't say anything.
We're not in this.

467
00:20:26,442 --> 00:20:28,508
Webber, why'd you cough?

468
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:32,680
Well, it's... It's a little like
when a patient tells you

469
00:20:32,748 --> 00:20:35,182
they have one or
two drinks a week.

470
00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:37,734
We all round that number up

471
00:20:37,803 --> 00:20:42,206
because patients tend to
tell us what we want to hear.

472
00:20:42,275 --> 00:20:45,576
If they'll admit
to two drinks...

473
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:48,012
They're having so many more.

474
00:20:50,316 --> 00:20:52,036
I got... I got
something sharp here.

475
00:20:55,154 --> 00:20:56,420
Oh...

476
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:00,090
A lion tooth.

477
00:21:00,609 --> 00:21:01,876
All right.

478
00:21:01,961 --> 00:21:04,041
Hey, hey, hey, don't just
toss that aside just yet.

479
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:06,180
Boki, keep that safe, will you?

480
00:21:08,534 --> 00:21:10,818
Mrs. Carroll, I'm on my
way up to surgery now.

481
00:21:10,887 --> 00:21:15,038
The grandkids want
pictures of the lion,

482
00:21:15,108 --> 00:21:19,226
but these damn phones make it
so hard to see the damn buttons.

483
00:21:20,429 --> 00:21:21,646
May I?

484
00:21:24,934 --> 00:21:26,584
There. It's sent.

485
00:21:28,086 --> 00:21:30,406
You guys really
did get up close.

486
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:33,807
Martin faced a lion today.

487
00:21:35,277 --> 00:21:37,978
He faced a lion and
he didn't get eaten.

488
00:21:39,148 --> 00:21:40,548
He's not...

489
00:21:42,051 --> 00:21:44,251
It's not his time, Dr. Altman.

490
00:21:46,238 --> 00:21:48,989
Please don't make me a widow.

491
00:21:52,395 --> 00:21:53,711
I don't want you to worry.

492
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:57,865
I am very good at my job.

493
00:21:58,351 --> 00:21:59,566
Okay?

494
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:04,304
Watch the angle. You're
gonna clip the perforators.

495
00:22:04,373 --> 00:22:06,707
No, no, stop.

496
00:22:06,775 --> 00:22:08,158
Lexie, I'm sorry,

497
00:22:08,227 --> 00:22:11,027
but I think I should do this.

498
00:22:11,096 --> 00:22:13,364
Yeah, yeah. It's... It's okay.

499
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:15,783
Next time.

500
00:22:19,605 --> 00:22:22,039
I'm not gonna tell
Mark what to do.

501
00:22:22,742 --> 00:22:23,974
You're not?

502
00:22:24,043 --> 00:22:26,176
They're gonna move
in together either way.

503
00:22:26,245 --> 00:22:28,628
The man has always
been easy to read.

504
00:22:28,697 --> 00:22:30,664
And the only thing
that could change that

505
00:22:30,732 --> 00:22:32,866
is if he knew he still
had a shot with you.

506
00:22:35,104 --> 00:22:36,219
Really?

507
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:38,672
He's happy with
the eyeball doctor.

508
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:40,669
So make sure you want him
back because you want him,

509
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:43,360
not because he's
with somebody else.

510
00:22:43,429 --> 00:22:46,079
All right. The
grafting is complete.

511
00:22:46,148 --> 00:22:47,815
Let's wean him off bypass.

512
00:22:49,585 --> 00:22:52,319
Dr. Karev, it's yours.
It's from a Morgan.

513
00:22:52,387 --> 00:22:54,672
"Did you get my last
text? Where are you?"

514
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:57,207
And then it says, "We
need to talk," all caps.

515
00:22:57,276 --> 00:22:59,304
Is that the intern with
the preemie? Yep.

516
00:23:02,081 --> 00:23:04,548
"You're ignoring
me. You're a total..."

517
00:23:04,617 --> 00:23:06,717
Then there's a lot
of strong language.

518
00:23:06,786 --> 00:23:08,735
If you need to step
away, just say so.

519
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:11,021
I'm fine. Are we warmed?

520
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:12,540
Yes, we are doctor.

521
00:23:12,608 --> 00:23:14,369
For what it's worth, I think
you're doing the right thing.

522
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:17,795
She needs to figure out how to
take care of herself and her baby.

523
00:23:17,863 --> 00:23:19,145
She's alone.

524
00:23:19,214 --> 00:23:21,142
There is no time like
the present to embrace it.

525
00:23:22,835 --> 00:23:24,968
Turn it off. Please.

526
00:23:25,037 --> 00:23:27,905
All right. Removing the
aortic cross-clamp now.

527
00:23:27,974 --> 00:23:29,350
I see some bleeding. Damn it.

528
00:23:29,374 --> 00:23:31,186
The ventricle's ruptured.

529
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:33,971
3-0 prolene. Get in there
with the suction, Karev.

530
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:36,246
Come on, Martin.
Come on. Damn it.

531
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,376
Meredith...

532
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,950
Hey, just don't
talk to me. Okay?

533
00:23:40,019 --> 00:23:42,380
She knew I would hate you, but
she didn't want me to hate you.

534
00:23:42,404 --> 00:23:43,498
Do you know what that means?

535
00:23:43,522 --> 00:23:45,017
It means she's
planning to forgive you

536
00:23:45,041 --> 00:23:47,591
or she's desperately trying
to find a way to forgive you.

537
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,727
And it doesn't matter
if it was just sex.

538
00:23:49,795 --> 00:23:51,795
She didn't want
me to know, okay?

539
00:23:51,864 --> 00:23:53,647
And now I do, so don't.

540
00:24:44,416 --> 00:24:45,627
All right, give me a
pledget. Here you go.

541
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:47,462
Shouldn't we go back
on bypass and patch it?

542
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:48,963
I mean, one slip, and
this guy's as good as dead.

543
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:49,987
Then I better not slip.

544
00:24:50,038 --> 00:24:51,838
Okay, nobody breathe.

545
00:25:09,658 --> 00:25:12,076
Okay. Cut it. Let's
see if it worked.

546
00:25:17,499 --> 00:25:18,593
I don't see any blood.

547
00:25:20,236 --> 00:25:22,569
Crap. You did it.

548
00:25:22,638 --> 00:25:24,904
I did, didn't I?

549
00:25:24,974 --> 00:25:27,391
All right. Let's finish up.

550
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:32,712
Just so you know, she's
tweaking about Colleen

551
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:33,880
and all the others.

552
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:35,994
Excuse me? I tried
to talk her down,

553
00:25:36,018 --> 00:25:39,052
but it could get ugly,
mauled-by-a-lion ugly.

554
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:44,525
You talked to your
ex about my exes?

555
00:25:44,593 --> 00:25:46,260
Yeah. I wanted some input.

556
00:25:46,328 --> 00:25:48,690
No. No, no, no. He does not get
to have that input on our love life.

557
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:51,782
Okay, excuse me.
Colleen was an ortho nurse.

558
00:25:51,851 --> 00:25:52,994
I worked with her
every day for two years,

559
00:25:53,018 --> 00:25:55,719
and I had no idea
that the two of you...

560
00:25:55,788 --> 00:25:56,870
She's seen you naked.

561
00:25:58,341 --> 00:26:00,590
Okay, fine. What do
you want to know?

562
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:02,592
I want names.

563
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:05,309
Her.

564
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:08,686
And her.

565
00:26:11,553 --> 00:26:14,354
And her, over by the
soda machine. Yeah, twice.

566
00:26:14,423 --> 00:26:16,034
Okay, that's Noelle.
She's not even gay.

567
00:26:16,058 --> 00:26:17,298
Well, she was that night.

568
00:26:18,477 --> 00:26:22,296
Also Nancy in
Path, Meg in Dermo,

569
00:26:22,364 --> 00:26:23,880
nurse Tia and her sister,

570
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:26,383
but, you know, not
at the same time.

571
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:31,738
Can I get something
for the pain?

572
00:26:31,807 --> 00:26:34,608
You are maxed out
on pain meds, buddy.

573
00:26:34,677 --> 00:26:36,243
Of course I am.

574
00:26:36,311 --> 00:26:38,628
I swear to God, Paul,
you're such a wussy.

575
00:26:38,697 --> 00:26:40,630
No one thinks that. They should.

576
00:26:40,699 --> 00:26:43,133
Naomi does.

577
00:26:43,202 --> 00:26:45,786
Gotta be why she didn't
tell me that Kirby was a lion.

578
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:49,172
She knew I would've freaked
out. We met on a dating site.

579
00:26:49,241 --> 00:26:53,343
And when I saw her profile,
she seemed so adventurous,

580
00:26:53,412 --> 00:26:54,661
outdoorsy.

581
00:26:54,729 --> 00:26:57,597
Maybe I misrepresented
myself a little bit.

582
00:26:57,666 --> 00:27:00,233
Pretended I was
adventurous and outdoorsy.

583
00:27:00,302 --> 00:27:03,370
When we met, I could
tell she was disappointed.

584
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:08,341
But she stuck around,

585
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:11,078
trying to see if

586
00:27:11,146 --> 00:27:13,563
the guy I pretended to be
was in here somewhere.

587
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:17,317
But when I shoved my
arm into Kirby's mouth

588
00:27:17,386 --> 00:27:19,202
and I felt him chomp down,

589
00:27:19,271 --> 00:27:21,037
I screamed.

590
00:27:22,441 --> 00:27:23,990
I really, really screamed.

591
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:26,660
She knows the truth.

592
00:27:27,746 --> 00:27:31,882
I am a wussy.

593
00:27:31,951 --> 00:27:34,751
Hang on. Kirby was going for her

594
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:36,169
and not you,

595
00:27:36,238 --> 00:27:38,505
and you body-blocked a lion?

596
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:43,526
Son, you are a hero.

597
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:47,447
You were the knight
on the white horse

598
00:27:47,515 --> 00:27:49,916
who stared into
the dragon's jaws

599
00:27:49,985 --> 00:27:53,305
and shoved his fist straight
down the bastard's throat.

600
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:57,975
So, I saved her?

601
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:01,144
I'll tell you one thing,

602
00:28:01,213 --> 00:28:03,747
there's no way I would've
been able to do what you did.

603
00:28:03,816 --> 00:28:04,816
Really?

604
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:10,554
Yeah. Me... I mean, me either.

605
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:13,090
Huh...

606
00:28:13,159 --> 00:28:15,025
You want to come
talk to the wife?

607
00:28:15,094 --> 00:28:16,638
You just want an audience
while you do your victory lap.

608
00:28:16,662 --> 00:28:18,261
You bet I do.

609
00:28:27,223 --> 00:28:30,690
You're not even a little interested
in why I know about AND?

610
00:28:30,759 --> 00:28:32,476
It's 'cause I have
to decide today if

611
00:28:32,545 --> 00:28:34,878
I make Robbins operate
on Tommy's fistula

612
00:28:34,947 --> 00:28:36,980
or I just let him die.

613
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:38,259
I didn't know you
were there already.

614
00:28:38,283 --> 00:28:39,583
Yeah, 'cause you vaporized.

615
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:41,968
I'm sorry. I was in surgery.

616
00:28:42,037 --> 00:28:44,688
He had such a
good day yesterday.

617
00:28:46,459 --> 00:28:49,093
I actually went online last
night and found a used crib,

618
00:28:49,161 --> 00:28:52,129
and then this
morning, it's like,

619
00:28:52,198 --> 00:28:55,816
"Why can't he just have a
few good days in a row?"

620
00:28:55,884 --> 00:28:58,385
I don't know what to do.
What am I supposed to do?

621
00:28:59,704 --> 00:29:01,638
I think it's time for you to

622
00:29:01,706 --> 00:29:04,574
consider the quality of life
that you want to offer Tommy.

623
00:29:04,643 --> 00:29:07,143
I don't need you to give me
the frigging party line, Alex.

624
00:29:07,212 --> 00:29:08,378
I have Robbins for that.

625
00:29:08,447 --> 00:29:10,197
I need you to tell
me what to do.

626
00:29:10,265 --> 00:29:12,132
It's not my decision.

627
00:29:12,201 --> 00:29:14,534
Hey. Hey. Don't get
all objective on me now.

628
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,564
It's not the time.

629
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:17,988
No, it is the time.

630
00:29:18,057 --> 00:29:21,191
Look, I'm not his dad,
I'm not your boyfriend,

631
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:23,977
and you can't rely on me to
help you make this decision.

632
00:29:24,045 --> 00:29:26,163
Wow. Really? Now?

633
00:29:26,215 --> 00:29:27,892
In the worst moment of my life,

634
00:29:27,916 --> 00:29:29,627
you want to make sure I
understand we're not a couple?

635
00:29:29,651 --> 00:29:30,771
Yeah, 'cause you know what?

636
00:29:30,819 --> 00:29:33,520
This isn't the worst
moment of your life.

637
00:29:33,589 --> 00:29:36,289
The worst moment of your life
is gonna be when Tommy dies,

638
00:29:36,358 --> 00:29:38,403
or when he doesn't die and
he's in pain and frustrated

639
00:29:38,427 --> 00:29:40,422
because his body won't
do what he wants it to do,

640
00:29:40,446 --> 00:29:42,223
or his brain doesn't work
like the other kids' brains work,

641
00:29:42,247 --> 00:29:44,292
and you're spending half your
life going to the doctor's office.

642
00:29:44,316 --> 00:29:45,816
So what if he's not perfect?

643
00:29:45,885 --> 00:29:48,285
Why do you all people think
that just because he's blind,

644
00:29:48,353 --> 00:29:51,499
or impaired or not a freaking
doctor, he's not worth something?

645
00:29:51,523 --> 00:29:54,324
The point is, it doesn't
matter what the rest of us think.

646
00:29:54,392 --> 00:29:57,393
At the end of the day, all
that matters is what you think.

647
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:59,545
So decide... That's
what I'm trying to do.

648
00:29:59,614 --> 00:30:00,780
No, you're not.

649
00:30:00,849 --> 00:30:02,689
Look, you're standing
at the nursery bawling,

650
00:30:02,718 --> 00:30:04,384
looking at all the
healthy babies,

651
00:30:04,453 --> 00:30:06,653
feeling sorry for
yourself. Stop it.

652
00:30:06,722 --> 00:30:09,906
Look, no one's saying that you
didn't get dealt a crappy hand. You did.

653
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:11,958
But now you've
gotta deal with it.

654
00:30:12,027 --> 00:30:15,145
You. Not me and you. You.

655
00:30:19,635 --> 00:30:20,834
Hey.

656
00:30:20,903 --> 00:30:22,803
Hey.

657
00:30:22,871 --> 00:30:24,738
I brought you a treat.

658
00:30:25,607 --> 00:30:27,073
Thanks.

659
00:30:31,446 --> 00:30:32,462
Whatcha doing?

660
00:30:36,435 --> 00:30:38,296
Whole organ decellularization.

661
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,498
I wash the hearts
with the solvent

662
00:30:40,522 --> 00:30:43,390
for the next 12 hours, and then

663
00:30:43,458 --> 00:30:47,093
it drains them of their cells so
Teddy and I can reseed them.

664
00:30:47,162 --> 00:30:49,529
So you're making new
hearts from scratch.

665
00:30:52,101 --> 00:30:53,500
Yeah. Kinda.

666
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:56,169
Cool.

667
00:31:04,262 --> 00:31:05,840
Mrs. Carroll, I just
wanted to tell you

668
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:07,314
that your husband's
surgery went...

669
00:31:09,368 --> 00:31:11,396
Mrs. Carroll, I'm
sorry to wake you.

670
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:14,270
Mrs. Carroll? Mrs. Carroll?

671
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:16,856
Oh, no. Oh, no. I need a gurney.

672
00:31:32,124 --> 00:31:34,091
Hey. We're doing the surgery,

673
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:36,293
but she doesn't
want you involved.

674
00:31:36,362 --> 00:31:39,129
Yeah. Yeah. Let
me know how it goes.

675
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:40,830
Hey.

676
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:43,634
You were a great doctor today.

677
00:31:43,702 --> 00:31:46,503
He's gonna need
a really tough mom.

678
00:31:46,572 --> 00:31:49,405
And if hating you
helps make her tough...

679
00:31:49,474 --> 00:31:50,607
Yeah.

680
00:32:01,136 --> 00:32:02,969
Naomi?

681
00:32:03,038 --> 00:32:04,966
Naomi, I'm here.
Don't try to move.

682
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:07,374
You have about
a million stitches.

683
00:32:08,276 --> 00:32:09,325
He's gone.

684
00:32:09,394 --> 00:32:10,627
No, I'm right here.

685
00:32:10,696 --> 00:32:11,936
I'm right beside you.

686
00:32:12,681 --> 00:32:15,849
Kirby. He's gone.

687
00:32:15,917 --> 00:32:17,634
He's been my best
friend for 15 years,

688
00:32:17,702 --> 00:32:20,286
and now they're
gonna take him away.

689
00:32:21,489 --> 00:32:22,589
Because of you.

690
00:32:24,092 --> 00:32:25,642
I saved you.

691
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:28,123
He freaked out because you
were screaming like a little bitch.

692
00:32:28,147 --> 00:32:31,982
I was screaming like a bitch
because he was going for your throat.

693
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:35,635
Dr. Avery and I are gonna just
let you two have some privacy.

694
00:32:35,704 --> 00:32:38,688
My throat? Are you kidding
me? That's how Kirby plays.

695
00:32:38,756 --> 00:32:42,125
That's how he hunts
because he's a lion

696
00:32:42,194 --> 00:32:43,914
living in a two-bedroom townhome

697
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:46,846
when he should be
roaming the frigging savanna.

698
00:32:46,915 --> 00:32:49,615
That lion is braver
than any of us.

699
00:32:49,684 --> 00:32:54,938
You'd be dead if it weren't
for me. I'm a knight on a horse.

700
00:32:55,007 --> 00:32:56,807
I slayed a dragon.

701
00:32:56,875 --> 00:32:59,743
I am a hero, and we are so over.

702
00:33:02,815 --> 00:33:04,514
That's disappointing.

703
00:33:04,582 --> 00:33:05,682
But not surprising.

704
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:08,318
I mean, an idiot
dating an idiot.

705
00:33:14,092 --> 00:33:16,326
I have something I
think you should see.

706
00:33:17,963 --> 00:33:19,112
Come with me.

707
00:33:29,208 --> 00:33:31,308
Maybe. No.

708
00:33:35,481 --> 00:33:37,514
What are you doing?

709
00:33:37,582 --> 00:33:40,542
Trying to figure out how many
dermatology fellows my wife's banged.

710
00:33:40,585 --> 00:33:42,619
For sure her.

711
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:45,388
Yeah, that one, probably, too.

712
00:33:45,457 --> 00:33:47,535
"Specializes in complete
body rejuvenation."

713
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:48,799
Yeah, I bet you do, Cheryl.

714
00:33:48,844 --> 00:33:51,511
You gotta get over it.
Everybody's got a past.

715
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:53,257
Look, I'm fine with
her having a past.

716
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:55,648
It's just, I didn't know
I was working with it

717
00:33:55,717 --> 00:33:57,828
and operating with it,
seeing it in the cafeteria.

718
00:33:57,852 --> 00:34:00,269
That woman wakes up every day,

719
00:34:00,338 --> 00:34:03,372
sees my face in her
kitchen holding her kid,

720
00:34:03,441 --> 00:34:05,157
the kid that you and I

721
00:34:05,244 --> 00:34:06,492
made together.

722
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,081
Yeah, I guess...

723
00:34:11,149 --> 00:34:12,744
I guess that can't
be easy for her.

724
00:34:12,768 --> 00:34:15,328
Easy? Knowing you've been
with the golden boy of this hospital?

725
00:34:16,738 --> 00:34:18,505
Woman's in hell, Torres.

726
00:34:18,573 --> 00:34:20,607
Okay.

727
00:34:20,675 --> 00:34:23,943
I'm a God. It's killing her.

728
00:34:27,699 --> 00:34:30,967
The nurse said your
surgery was flawless,

729
00:34:31,035 --> 00:34:34,104
that now I have the
heart of a 50-year-old.

730
00:34:34,172 --> 00:34:35,555
Thank you, Dr. Altman.

731
00:34:37,225 --> 00:34:38,875
Martin... Where's Emma?

732
00:34:38,944 --> 00:34:40,743
Did you tell her yet?

733
00:34:47,352 --> 00:34:51,120
When your surgery was finished,

734
00:34:51,189 --> 00:34:54,524
I went to look for your
wife in the waiting room.

735
00:34:54,593 --> 00:34:56,671
I thought that she
had fallen asleep,

736
00:34:56,695 --> 00:34:59,055
so I tried to wake her, but...

737
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:02,099
Oh, no.

738
00:35:02,167 --> 00:35:03,866
We performed CPR.

739
00:35:03,936 --> 00:35:07,119
I tried to resuscitate
her myself, but she...

740
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:08,722
She didn't make it.

741
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:12,492
They pronounced her dead
a few minutes ago in the ER.

742
00:35:12,561 --> 00:35:14,076
I am so sorry.

743
00:35:16,348 --> 00:35:18,614
Oh, no.

744
00:35:20,018 --> 00:35:21,685
Not Emma.

745
00:35:22,754 --> 00:35:24,287
No.

746
00:35:29,694 --> 00:35:31,010
She died?

747
00:35:32,931 --> 00:35:33,980
Yes.

748
00:35:40,188 --> 00:35:41,687
Emma's dead?

749
00:35:43,809 --> 00:35:45,224
Yes.

750
00:35:50,181 --> 00:35:51,848
She's gone?

751
00:35:54,135 --> 00:35:57,587
Yes, Martin. Emma is dead.

752
00:36:02,794 --> 00:36:04,577
Oh, Emma.

753
00:36:05,747 --> 00:36:07,180
Emma.

754
00:36:08,483 --> 00:36:09,783
Oh, God, Emma.

755
00:36:11,135 --> 00:36:12,369
Oh, no.

756
00:36:15,356 --> 00:36:16,907
No.

757
00:36:17,709 --> 00:36:19,993
No, no. No.

758
00:36:24,683 --> 00:36:25,832
Bailey.

759
00:36:27,302 --> 00:36:29,169
I'm sorry about before.

760
00:36:29,237 --> 00:36:31,421
You didn't need to see that.

761
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:33,356
I didn't see anything.

762
00:36:33,425 --> 00:36:35,508
We both know that you did.

763
00:36:35,577 --> 00:36:38,227
Now you and I are scheduled
for a whipple tomorrow.

764
00:36:38,296 --> 00:36:41,865
I know that Cristina
is one of your own,

765
00:36:41,934 --> 00:36:46,052
so I understand if you prefer
that I not scrub in with you.

766
00:36:47,923 --> 00:36:49,990
Uh...

767
00:36:50,058 --> 00:36:52,758
I won't pretend to

768
00:36:52,827 --> 00:36:57,113
understand the thing you
and Cristina have going on,

769
00:36:57,182 --> 00:37:04,137
but I do know that affairs
don't happen in a vacuum.

770
00:37:04,206 --> 00:37:05,926
You're human and you
made a human mistake.

771
00:37:12,948 --> 00:37:16,899
You did a terrible thing. It doesn't
mean you're a terrible person.

772
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:24,270
<i>We've all heard the warnings.</i>

773
00:37:27,595 --> 00:37:29,796
<i>And we've ignored them.</i>

774
00:37:30,464 --> 00:37:32,498
I am...

775
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:37,804
I am a widow.

776
00:37:42,276 --> 00:37:45,411
I am a widow.

777
00:37:46,781 --> 00:37:48,547
I am a...

778
00:38:09,404 --> 00:38:10,469
Lobby?

779
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:11,704
Lobby.

780
00:38:21,616 --> 00:38:22,949
Parking lot?

781
00:38:23,018 --> 00:38:24,450
Parking lot.

782
00:38:27,989 --> 00:38:31,251
You know what? I forgot that
I have some charting to do,

783
00:38:31,275 --> 00:38:33,409
so have a great night.

784
00:38:38,466 --> 00:38:40,300
<i>We push our luck.</i>

785
00:38:44,338 --> 00:38:46,389
Each and every
one of these items

786
00:38:46,457 --> 00:38:49,392
was removed from a patient.

787
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:50,900
Christmas lights? Come on.

788
00:38:50,946 --> 00:38:52,996
Where would you...
You don't want to know.

789
00:38:53,064 --> 00:38:54,330
How did you...

790
00:38:54,399 --> 00:38:55,639
Very, very carefully.

791
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:57,033
Okay.

792
00:38:57,102 --> 00:38:58,368
It's pretty great, right?

793
00:38:58,987 --> 00:39:01,287
Actually,

794
00:39:01,356 --> 00:39:02,388
yeah.

795
00:39:02,457 --> 00:39:04,802
Well, sometimes we
have geniuses on our table

796
00:39:04,826 --> 00:39:07,026
and sometimes we have idiots.

797
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:10,580
I, for one,

798
00:39:10,648 --> 00:39:13,950
am partial to the idiot.

799
00:39:14,019 --> 00:39:17,337
You don't get a lion's
tooth from a genius.

800
00:39:19,824 --> 00:39:21,708
<i>We roll the dice.</i>

801
00:39:25,279 --> 00:39:26,930
Okay. Hey, here's the thing.

802
00:39:26,998 --> 00:39:30,238
I do know about your exes,
and frankly, sometimes it sucks.

803
00:39:30,635 --> 00:39:31,884
Okay.

804
00:39:31,953 --> 00:39:33,648
And you know, I mean,
I don't like knowing,

805
00:39:33,672 --> 00:39:35,988
and sometimes, you
know, it drives me crazy.

806
00:39:36,057 --> 00:39:37,568
I know. So maybe
there's a reason.

807
00:39:37,592 --> 00:39:40,226
There's a very good
reason that I was...

808
00:39:40,295 --> 00:39:42,490
I wasn't telling
you about my exes.

809
00:39:42,514 --> 00:39:43,830
I was trying to spare you.

810
00:39:43,899 --> 00:39:45,164
Yeah, I understand.

811
00:39:45,232 --> 00:39:46,712
You do? Yeah, I do.

812
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:49,630
Okay, 'cause I thought
we were fighting.

813
00:39:49,654 --> 00:39:50,670
We totally are.

814
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:54,190
<i>We play with fire.</i>

815
00:39:54,259 --> 00:39:56,299
Look what Daddy
got you today, Zola.

816
00:39:58,196 --> 00:40:00,663
And now put your
head down. There it is.

817
00:40:00,715 --> 00:40:02,698
Well. Roar.

818
00:40:02,768 --> 00:40:04,750
Don't do that.

819
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:07,019
Well, you think it's
cute when Zola does it.

820
00:40:07,539 --> 00:40:08,772
What is it?

821
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:11,280
If you ever cheat
on me, I'll kill you.

822
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:14,310
Okay. I mean it.

823
00:40:14,378 --> 00:40:15,945
Okay. Say it.

824
00:40:17,032 --> 00:40:19,065
I will never cheat on you.

825
00:40:20,201 --> 00:40:21,985
You want to talk about it? No.

826
00:40:22,703 --> 00:40:23,769
Okay.

827
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:25,270
<i>It's human nature.</i>

828
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:26,968
<i>When we're told not
to touch something...</i>

829
00:40:28,793 --> 00:40:29,826
<i>we usually do.</i>

830
00:40:30,578 --> 00:40:32,245
<i>Even if we know better.</i>

831
00:41:06,965 --> 00:41:10,549
<i>Maybe because deep down,</i>

832
00:41:10,618 --> 00:41:12,785
<i>we're just asking for trouble.</i>
