1
00:00:01,751 --> 00:00:03,751
She's a love bug.

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:05,765
<i>Have you ever had the
starring role in a play?</i>

3
00:00:05,789 --> 00:00:07,089
<i>A solo in a recital?</i>

4
00:00:07,157 --> 00:00:09,302
She's gonna take her first
steps any minute. I can feel it.

5
00:00:09,326 --> 00:00:10,492
<i>All eyes on you.</i>

6
00:00:10,561 --> 00:00:11,971
Okay, so I am gonna
give you the giraffe,

7
00:00:11,995 --> 00:00:13,205
and maybe she'll walk to you.

8
00:00:13,229 --> 00:00:14,641
Well, she's not
gonna do it on cue.

9
00:00:14,665 --> 00:00:16,009
She's gonna surprise us, right?

10
00:00:16,033 --> 00:00:17,910
You gonna surprise
us? Here you go.

11
00:00:17,934 --> 00:00:20,135
<i>Waiting for you to do
what they came to see.</i>

12
00:00:20,203 --> 00:00:21,670
No! Hi. Yeah, Daddy.

13
00:00:21,738 --> 00:00:23,182
She's gonna take her first
steps while she's in day care,

14
00:00:23,206 --> 00:00:24,317
and then I'm gonna kill
myself. No, she won't.

15
00:00:24,341 --> 00:00:25,569
You're not gonna
do that, right, Zo?

16
00:00:25,593 --> 00:00:27,387
Zo, come to Daddy.
Come to Daddy.

17
00:00:27,411 --> 00:00:30,045
Come on. Come get
the giraffe. Come on.

18
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:32,158
You're just the cutest
kid on the entire planet.

19
00:00:32,182 --> 00:00:33,932
Why is that? She's perfect.

20
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,150
Okay.

21
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:38,720
<i>Feeling the incredible
pressure to perform.</i>

22
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:41,034
<i>There was a time when they
used to call operating rooms</i>

23
00:00:41,058 --> 00:00:42,290
<i>an operating theater.</i>

24
00:00:46,163 --> 00:00:48,046
<i>It still feels like one.</i>

25
00:00:51,252 --> 00:00:53,418
<i>Scores of people get
ready for the show.</i>

26
00:00:54,404 --> 00:00:55,770
<i>The sets are arranged.</i>

27
00:00:58,074 --> 00:00:59,508
<i>There are costumes,</i>

28
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:03,911
<i>masks,</i>

29
00:01:06,116 --> 00:01:07,282
<i>props.</i>

30
00:01:09,219 --> 00:01:11,139
<i>Everything has to be rehearsed,</i>

31
00:01:13,023 --> 00:01:14,623
<i>choreographed,</i>

32
00:01:14,692 --> 00:01:18,927
<i>all leading to the moment
when the curtain goes up.</i>

33
00:01:18,996 --> 00:01:21,162
<i>You know what they
say about Carnegie Hall?</i>

34
00:01:21,231 --> 00:01:22,742
<i>There's only one
way to get there.</i>

35
00:01:22,766 --> 00:01:26,468
Practice, practice, practice
until it is perfect, people.

36
00:01:26,537 --> 00:01:29,883
This is a long, complex
procedure with many parts.

37
00:01:29,907 --> 00:01:32,774
Therefore many
opportunities for error.

38
00:01:32,843 --> 00:01:34,087
So we're gonna
go over this again.

39
00:01:34,111 --> 00:01:35,755
Team leaders,
let's get in place.

40
00:01:35,779 --> 00:01:37,257
All right, green team,
over here, please.

41
00:01:37,281 --> 00:01:38,975
Let's go, red. We've
offered this family

42
00:01:38,999 --> 00:01:40,382
every pro bono dollar,

43
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:43,610
every surgical hand, every
resource this hospital has.

44
00:01:43,637 --> 00:01:47,356
So I'm asking you for every
resource that you have.

45
00:01:47,424 --> 00:01:50,792
Be sharp, be
present, be focused.

46
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:53,141
Dr. Robbins has been
caring for these children

47
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:55,007
since the day they were born.

48
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:57,732
They will each get
a new life today.

49
00:01:57,801 --> 00:02:01,436
Our actions will decide
what kind of lives they will be.

50
00:02:08,311 --> 00:02:09,471
Let's begin.

51
00:02:13,567 --> 00:02:15,233
I thought I had Dr. Knox.

52
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:17,180
You know what I love
about you? The warmth.

53
00:02:17,204 --> 00:02:19,115
You were doing
the conjoined twins.

54
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,134
Well, now Knox is
doing the conjoined twins.

55
00:02:21,158 --> 00:02:23,069
Uh-huh. Uh, we're
not talking about it.

56
00:02:23,093 --> 00:02:24,453
Of course we're
talking about it.

57
00:02:25,446 --> 00:02:27,412
It is a crazy idea

58
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:31,032
that I am not talking
about, because it's crazy.

59
00:02:31,101 --> 00:02:33,034
It's not crazy. We'd
sleep in one bed,

60
00:02:33,103 --> 00:02:34,903
we would have breakfast
at the same table,

61
00:02:34,972 --> 00:02:37,022
we'd have one electric
bill instead of two.

62
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:39,002
Oh, that's why you want
me to move in with you?

63
00:02:39,026 --> 00:02:40,403
So we could save
on the electric?

64
00:02:40,427 --> 00:02:42,027
Yeah, it's the
responsible thing to do.

65
00:02:42,296 --> 00:02:43,296
For the planet.

66
00:02:43,347 --> 00:02:45,647
I am not moving in with you.

67
00:02:45,715 --> 00:02:47,727
Look, we've been
together, what, two weeks?

68
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:50,335
Two weeks and nine
months, before the pause.

69
00:02:50,404 --> 00:02:52,382
And I want to hit play
again, right where we left off.

70
00:02:52,406 --> 00:02:54,006
I don't want to start
at the beginning.

71
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:56,186
Because it's good
for the planet?

72
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:57,625
And I have a better TV.

73
00:02:57,694 --> 00:03:00,845
Look, come on, now. Admit
it. You want to live with me.

74
00:03:01,564 --> 00:03:02,998
You love me.

75
00:03:04,801 --> 00:03:05,967
I want

76
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:09,288
Knox back.

77
00:03:12,175 --> 00:03:13,842
Flaps are inset and viable.

78
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:16,177
We are looking at,
at least, 18 hours,

79
00:03:16,246 --> 00:03:17,841
so come and go if you need to.

80
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:19,214
Hydrate, eat,

81
00:03:19,283 --> 00:03:22,533
but be here at least 30
minutes before your procedures.

82
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:24,242
All right. Next up,
general surgery.

83
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:25,748
First we need to
establish each baby's

84
00:03:25,772 --> 00:03:27,417
blood supply to
the shared colon.

85
00:03:27,441 --> 00:03:29,235
Then we separate the colon,
making the first incision...

86
00:03:29,259 --> 00:03:32,343
I will make the first incision.
We'll separate the colon.

87
00:03:32,413 --> 00:03:34,791
Okay, and now I'm checking
the displaced kidneys...

88
00:03:34,815 --> 00:03:36,175
To make sure they're
intact and functioning.

89
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:37,260
That's implied.

90
00:03:37,284 --> 00:03:39,317
I don't care. Say it.

91
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:40,663
Checking the
kidneys to make sure

92
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:41,898
they're intact and functioning.

93
00:03:41,922 --> 00:03:43,182
Man, she's wound up tight.

94
00:03:43,206 --> 00:03:44,957
Thought you were off work today.

95
00:03:45,025 --> 00:03:46,853
I won't see another one
of these in my lifetime.

96
00:03:46,877 --> 00:03:48,304
Okay, you need to tie that...

97
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:49,260
You're doing the flip,
right, Karev? With Robbins?

98
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:50,361
Mmm-hmm.

99
00:03:50,431 --> 00:03:52,141
The flip's a critical
part. You ready?

100
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:53,910
Yes, sir. ARIZONA:
You forgot to cauterize.

101
00:03:53,934 --> 00:03:55,578
You want this baby to bleed out?
- Do I...

102
00:03:55,602 --> 00:03:57,247
No, I... ARIZONA:
Yeah, I should think not.

103
00:03:57,271 --> 00:03:58,982
Look, I know this
procedure's her baby,

104
00:03:59,006 --> 00:04:00,649
but she keeps
nitpicking everybody,

105
00:04:00,673 --> 00:04:02,718
she'll destroy their confidence.

106
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:03,786
Don't let her do that to you.

107
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,744
No, sir.

108
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:08,558
Good, because if this flip goes
wrong, she's gonna blame you.

109
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:11,094
It'll go on your record, and
they have boards coming up.

110
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:12,262
It's not gonna look good.

111
00:04:12,286 --> 00:04:13,985
Did you check the pelvis?

112
00:04:14,054 --> 00:04:15,294
Glad it's not me.

113
00:04:15,322 --> 00:04:16,850
Okay, it's time to flip them.

114
00:04:16,874 --> 00:04:18,074
Karev, you're up.

115
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:28,883
Ready?

116
00:04:30,987 --> 00:04:32,420
Yeah.

117
00:04:32,489 --> 00:04:34,350
And why is the
flip so important?

118
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:36,207
It just gets very tricky.

119
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,876
They have open incisions,
so they have to stay sterile,

120
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:41,658
and we have to make sure that
they stay intubated and monitored.

121
00:04:41,682 --> 00:04:43,043
Okay. And we also have to keep

122
00:04:43,067 --> 00:04:45,178
all their IVs and wires
from getting tangled

123
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:47,413
and intertwined in the process.

124
00:04:47,437 --> 00:04:48,581
You know...

125
00:04:48,605 --> 00:04:51,038
Imagine changing the battery

126
00:04:51,107 --> 00:04:53,474
of your car while
speeding down the freeway.

127
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:57,562
Except it's not a
car or a battery.

128
00:04:57,631 --> 00:04:59,598
I mean, they're your babies.

129
00:04:59,667 --> 00:05:01,600
So... It's a bad
analogy. I'm sorry.

130
00:05:01,669 --> 00:05:04,909
No, that's the first thing you've
said that I've totally understood.

131
00:05:05,539 --> 00:05:09,791
But if the flip goes wrong,
then everything after that is...

132
00:05:09,859 --> 00:05:12,427
Is hosed.

133
00:05:12,496 --> 00:05:16,131
The doctors have planned
and rehearsed this for weeks.

134
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:17,866
I mean, they've got it down.

135
00:05:17,934 --> 00:05:19,445
Karev, you rushed it. You're
like two steps ahead of me.

136
00:05:19,469 --> 00:05:21,714
No, you over me. Yours
over mine, everything's fine.

137
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:23,132
Mine over yours,
babies in the morgue.

138
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,867
That's how it works. That's
your mnemonic device?

139
00:05:24,891 --> 00:05:26,635
Great. Now Brandi's
wounds are exposed,

140
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,938
and little Andi's gone without
oxygen for a whole minute.

141
00:05:28,962 --> 00:05:30,202
Okay, can we start over?

142
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:31,996
No, there's no time.

143
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:34,849
Let's just finish this practice
and try the flip again. Next.

144
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:36,546
Neuro. CALLIE: Ortho.

145
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:40,121
Okay, we will access and
separate the conjoined spinal canal.

146
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:41,834
Separate the bony
elements of the spine.

147
00:05:41,858 --> 00:05:42,935
Well, that was a train wreck.

148
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:44,159
You nearly killed both dolls.

149
00:05:44,194 --> 00:05:45,660
I have it. I know it.

150
00:05:45,746 --> 00:05:47,189
If only freakin' Robbins
would trust me to do it.

151
00:05:47,213 --> 00:05:48,841
- Doll killer.
- Meredith Grey.

152
00:05:48,865 --> 00:05:50,865
Hey, come with me.
OR two, right away.

153
00:05:55,872 --> 00:05:58,151
Okay, I am gonna tell you
something about my personal life.

154
00:05:58,175 --> 00:05:59,451
Really? Okay,

155
00:05:59,475 --> 00:06:01,325
my personal life is
none of your business.

156
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:02,755
The fact that I know things
about your personal life

157
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:04,996
is one of the great
sadnesses of my existence.

158
00:06:05,065 --> 00:06:06,105
Sorry about that.

159
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:07,276
And the fact that
you're going to know

160
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,644
about mine is
exponentially worse,

161
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:10,468
but I don't see how
we get around it.

162
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:11,570
Okay.

163
00:06:11,638 --> 00:06:13,522
We're about to
operate with Dr. Warren.

164
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:15,823
He and I are involved.

165
00:06:15,892 --> 00:06:17,258
Everybody knows that.

166
00:06:17,327 --> 00:06:18,493
Can you not pretend?

167
00:06:18,562 --> 00:06:21,329
Oh. Oh, you and Dr. Warren? Wow!

168
00:06:21,397 --> 00:06:25,116
He is going to try and discuss
personal matters in the OR today,

169
00:06:25,185 --> 00:06:26,429
and I don't want
that to happen. Okay.

170
00:06:26,453 --> 00:06:29,037
Okay, so I'm going
to teach you a lot.

171
00:06:29,106 --> 00:06:31,289
And you are gonna
ask questions a lot.

172
00:06:31,341 --> 00:06:33,525
And if he gets a personal
word in edgewise,

173
00:06:33,594 --> 00:06:35,989
I want you to forget which is
the business end of a scalpel

174
00:06:36,013 --> 00:06:39,047
real quick, and ask for help.

175
00:06:39,116 --> 00:06:40,526
Okay, but let me
get this straight.

176
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:43,250
You pulled me out of a
once-in-a-lifetime surgery

177
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:45,565
to be a buffer between
you and your boyfriend?

178
00:06:45,589 --> 00:06:47,549
Now don't you use that
kind of language with me.

179
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,393
Spinal separation complete.

180
00:06:53,529 --> 00:06:55,080
I have to go. Teddy.

181
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:57,543
It's been two weeks now. You
need a break, and she does, too.

182
00:06:57,567 --> 00:06:59,217
I got to go.

183
00:06:59,285 --> 00:07:02,387
Okay, I am now prepared
to separate them completely.

184
00:07:02,456 --> 00:07:04,000
Wait. Hold on. What
about complications?

185
00:07:04,024 --> 00:07:05,284
I mean, what if there's
a double hemivertebra

186
00:07:05,308 --> 00:07:06,491
or a tethered cord?

187
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,071
We will cross that bridge
when we come to it.

188
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:09,472
We're done here. I'm sorry.

189
00:07:09,496 --> 00:07:10,606
What if we're standing
on that bridge right now?

190
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:11,813
Dr. Robbins, I said...

191
00:07:11,881 --> 00:07:13,643
No, no, no. We haven't
even separated them yet.

192
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:15,344
We haven't gone through
the post-separation surgeries.

193
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:17,147
Dr. Robbins, stop.
There's so much...

194
00:07:17,171 --> 00:07:18,837
We're done practicing.

195
00:07:18,906 --> 00:07:22,190
We have practiced our
parts not only here in this OR,

196
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:24,259
but in the shower,
on your drive to work.

197
00:07:24,327 --> 00:07:25,793
We're ready.

198
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,279
We know what to do.

199
00:07:28,131 --> 00:07:30,565
Now we just have to do it.

200
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:45,964
Ladies and gentlemen,

201
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:49,250
I present to you Andi
and Brandi Edwards.

202
00:07:49,336 --> 00:07:51,703
Let's give them
new lives, shall we?

203
00:07:57,577 --> 00:07:58,657
It's show time.

204
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:17,807
Raising the skin
flap. Avery, you there?

205
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:19,308
One step ahead of
you. You want to race?

206
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:20,481
No, no, no. No racing.

207
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:22,367
That was fun last night.

208
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:24,580
Did you and Mer have a good
time? I know Julia had a good time.

209
00:08:24,604 --> 00:08:26,844
Yeah, we did. You got enough
length there for coverage?

210
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:28,901
Yeah, I'm dissecting from
the base to the midline.

211
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:30,519
Did Mer say
anything about Julia?

212
00:08:30,543 --> 00:08:31,921
She liked her.
Jackson, slow down.

213
00:08:31,945 --> 00:08:33,239
And Zola liked Julia, too?

214
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:34,963
Yes, she did.
Everybody liked Julia.

215
00:08:35,031 --> 00:08:36,525
Anybody else here meet Julia?

216
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:38,161
Did you like her? Show
of hands if you liked her.

217
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:40,046
You did? You did?

218
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:41,469
I'll update the parents.

219
00:08:44,841 --> 00:08:46,191
Hunt, they're clearly racing.

220
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,770
No racing. We're not racing.

221
00:08:47,794 --> 00:08:49,677
We have been
rehearsing this for months,

222
00:08:49,746 --> 00:08:51,240
and now they're gonna
jeopardize the patient...

223
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:53,710
Robbins, you take care of your
team, I'll look at the big picture.

224
00:08:53,734 --> 00:08:55,483
Done. I win.

225
00:08:55,552 --> 00:08:57,746
And by that, we mean
ready for the colon resection.

226
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:59,432
Cafeteria? Race you there.

227
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:01,416
General surgery teams, let's go.

228
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:05,487
Is that enough lap pads?

229
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:08,129
A little more is not gonna
hurt. They'll help mobilize it.

230
00:09:08,198 --> 00:09:10,209
How's Zola doing?
Oh, she's great, thanks.

231
00:09:10,233 --> 00:09:11,761
She's about a minute
away from walking.

232
00:09:11,785 --> 00:09:12,900
That's great.

233
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:14,713
And she's in the
day care downstairs?

234
00:09:14,737 --> 00:09:16,617
She is, yeah.
She really likes it.

235
00:09:16,657 --> 00:09:18,935
Must be nice, having the
whole family in the building.

236
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,269
Yeah. It's a win-win.

237
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:22,438
You love Dr. Shepherd,
and he loves you,

238
00:09:22,462 --> 00:09:23,956
and you see each other at work,

239
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,675
and then you see
each other at home.

240
00:09:25,699 --> 00:09:27,115
Just more of a good thing.

241
00:09:27,184 --> 00:09:28,928
Dr. Bailey, is that
the spleen right there?

242
00:09:28,952 --> 00:09:31,019
That is the spleen.

243
00:09:31,087 --> 00:09:32,631
So are we gonna take
out the whole thing?

244
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:35,073
We will. We will
take it right out.

245
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:37,420
So how many suture ligatures
do you think we'll need to do

246
00:09:37,444 --> 00:09:38,571
for the splenic vessels?

247
00:09:38,595 --> 00:09:41,346
Oh, could be two,
could be three.

248
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:45,466
I'll see if two does it, but I
may have to throw in a third.

249
00:09:45,535 --> 00:09:48,264
This is good stuff. I'm glad I
skipped the conjoined twins.

250
00:09:48,288 --> 00:09:50,099
There's beauty in the basics.

251
00:09:50,123 --> 00:09:52,101
There's beauty in sharing a
bowl of cereal with a woman that...

252
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:53,919
I can't remember
how to do a stick tie.

253
00:09:53,943 --> 00:09:55,543
No shame in that.

254
00:09:55,612 --> 00:09:57,462
There's no stupid questions.

255
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:58,896
You sure about that?

256
00:10:03,003 --> 00:10:04,636
Dr. Altman.

257
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:06,098
Dr. Yang. You paged me?

258
00:10:06,122 --> 00:10:07,955
I didn't realize Cristina was...

259
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:09,586
Do you want me to
step aside so she can...

260
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:11,526
No. But you paged her.

261
00:10:11,595 --> 00:10:13,122
It's no problem,
really. I don't mind.

262
00:10:13,146 --> 00:10:14,841
I can go peek in on the
progress of the conjoined twins...

263
00:10:14,865 --> 00:10:16,547
Stay put, Kepner.

264
00:10:17,901 --> 00:10:19,701
Yang. From the beginning?

265
00:10:19,769 --> 00:10:21,636
Yes.

266
00:10:21,705 --> 00:10:24,623
Vitals were stable after
receiving L.R. and packed cells.

267
00:10:24,691 --> 00:10:26,536
The bronch was already
placed when I entered the OR,

268
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,194
so I proceeded with the laser
endoscopy using the CO2 laser.

269
00:10:30,263 --> 00:10:31,913
Step-by-step.

270
00:10:31,981 --> 00:10:34,732
I had good visualization of
the tumor almost immediately.

271
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:37,001
About 80% of the tumor
had been vaporized

272
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,202
when the bleeding began.

273
00:10:38,271 --> 00:10:40,031
He had clots, which
were blocking my scope.

274
00:10:40,057 --> 00:10:42,407
I passed a brush through
the scope to clear the field.

275
00:10:42,476 --> 00:10:45,009
However, Henry's
hemorrhaging was so severe...

276
00:10:45,078 --> 00:10:46,078
Suction, Kepner.

277
00:10:48,281 --> 00:10:49,597
Kepner, suction.

278
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:55,854
Yang?

279
00:10:55,922 --> 00:10:57,688
Henry's hemorrhaging
was so severe

280
00:10:57,757 --> 00:10:59,707
that the brush did
not solve the problem.

281
00:10:59,776 --> 00:11:03,511
SATs dropped to 88. Blood
was coming out of the ET tube.

282
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:07,348
At that point, Dr. Webber exercised
his judgment and stepped in.

283
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:10,184
We cracked his chest and
tried to get to the source.

284
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:13,721
Henry became bradycardic,
so we pushed atropine.

285
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:17,291
Then I realized the tumor had
eroded through the pulmonary artery.

286
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,593
He flatlined.

287
00:11:18,661 --> 00:11:21,579
We did ACLS protocol
and got sinus brady.

288
00:11:21,648 --> 00:11:24,382
We pushed high-dose
epi. He flatlined again.

289
00:11:24,451 --> 00:11:26,117
We did more compressions.

290
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:30,338
We continued in this manner
until Dr. Webber and I both agreed

291
00:11:30,406 --> 00:11:32,957
that since he already lost
more than half his blood volume,

292
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:34,626
his heart could not restart.

293
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,727
We called time
of death, 8:52 p.m.

294
00:11:41,884 --> 00:11:42,884
Again.

295
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:45,686
When I entered the OR,

296
00:11:46,523 --> 00:11:48,089
Henry's vitals had been stable.

297
00:11:48,158 --> 00:11:49,957
He had received
L.R. and packed cells.

298
00:11:50,026 --> 00:11:51,525
The bronch was already placed so

299
00:11:51,594 --> 00:11:53,477
I proceeded with
the laser endoscopy.

300
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:57,731
And then, thanks to the
unhealthy level of comfort she felt

301
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,333
working for her husband,

302
00:11:59,402 --> 00:12:01,230
she took some liberties
with the clinical trial,

303
00:12:01,254 --> 00:12:03,483
and now neither of their
careers will ever be the same.

304
00:12:03,507 --> 00:12:05,084
You know, I would
love to go back

305
00:12:05,108 --> 00:12:06,652
to dividing the
gastrocolic ligament,

306
00:12:06,676 --> 00:12:08,287
but I'm not sure I
remember how to...

307
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:10,745
Figure it out. Look,
all I'm saying is,

308
00:12:10,814 --> 00:12:13,781
it'd be nice to maintain
some boundaries,

309
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:16,662
so a person's life doesn't fall
to pieces, like Dr. Grey's here.

310
00:12:16,686 --> 00:12:18,614
For the record, my life
is pretty great right now.

311
00:12:18,638 --> 00:12:20,366
You hush. No one's
interested in your life.

312
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:22,284
Dr. Grey. Please ask
me about a spleen.

313
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:24,203
Who's the last person you see
before you fall asleep at night?

314
00:12:24,227 --> 00:12:26,372
Or a pancreas. I've got
a very good view of it.

315
00:12:26,396 --> 00:12:27,695
It's tan and lobulated...

316
00:12:27,763 --> 00:12:29,163
Answer the question.

317
00:12:29,232 --> 00:12:32,399
Last person you see before
you fall asleep at night.

318
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:35,269
Derek Shepherd.

319
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:37,572
Must be nice. All I'm saying.

320
00:12:38,608 --> 00:12:39,707
Zero silk.

321
00:12:39,776 --> 00:12:40,776
Thank God.

322
00:12:42,912 --> 00:12:44,673
They're separating
the colon right now,

323
00:12:44,697 --> 00:12:46,692
making sure that they each
have good blood supply.

324
00:12:46,716 --> 00:12:48,111
Have they done
the flip thing yet?

325
00:12:48,135 --> 00:12:50,151
That's next.

326
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:51,531
Um, I got to get out to here.

327
00:12:51,555 --> 00:12:52,795
Is there a bar around here?

328
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,723
Um... Yeah. Across the street.

329
00:12:58,478 --> 00:13:01,196
He's not a total drunk, if
that's what you're thinking.

330
00:13:01,264 --> 00:13:02,880
He has a job.

331
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:04,749
It's a good one, with benefits.

332
00:13:04,818 --> 00:13:06,262
Seriously, Gretchen, I wasn't...

333
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:08,319
No, I know what
you were thinking.

334
00:13:08,387 --> 00:13:10,354
It's what everybody thinks.

335
00:13:10,423 --> 00:13:11,922
That we accidentally
got pregnant

336
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:14,842
and now we're stuck with
these kids we can't take care of.

337
00:13:14,911 --> 00:13:17,078
You're probably
placing bets in the OR

338
00:13:17,147 --> 00:13:19,246
of how long we'll stay together,

339
00:13:19,332 --> 00:13:22,250
or whose mother is gonna
end up raising the girls.

340
00:13:22,318 --> 00:13:25,819
Well, you can tell everyone
in that room that they're wrong.

341
00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:29,156
We love each other and
we wanted these babies.

342
00:13:29,226 --> 00:13:31,170
We're staying together, and we
will do whatever we need to do

343
00:13:31,194 --> 00:13:33,394
to make sure that they're okay.

344
00:13:33,463 --> 00:13:35,996
Including accepting
the hospital's charity,

345
00:13:37,533 --> 00:13:39,493
even if I have to sit
around with judgy doctors.

346
00:13:40,086 --> 00:13:41,352
I wasn't judging you.

347
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:43,988
Really. I just...

348
00:13:44,057 --> 00:13:46,891
I was thinking how lucky you are

349
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,920
to be with somebody
that you love.

350
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:53,358
Looks like Andi has the bulk
of the blood supply to the colon.

351
00:13:53,382 --> 00:13:54,826
So we'll give her
all the colon then?

352
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:56,962
And leave Brandi with an
ileostomy? I don't think so.

353
00:13:56,986 --> 00:13:58,352
I'll do an ileoproctostomy.

354
00:13:58,421 --> 00:13:59,432
Maybe they should just
share, so we don't have to...

355
00:13:59,456 --> 00:14:00,855
No. We'll do it my way.

356
00:14:00,924 --> 00:14:02,635
Check the function of the
blood supply to the kidney.

357
00:14:02,659 --> 00:14:04,553
Flip's coming up,
and I don't want

358
00:14:04,577 --> 00:14:06,897
a repeat of this
morning's rehearsal.

359
00:14:08,915 --> 00:14:10,493
That's what I want
to talk to you about.

360
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:11,994
I'm a little nervous about it.

361
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:14,352
We practiced that flip
before, and it turned out great.

362
00:14:14,421 --> 00:14:17,438
And today... Robbins
doesn't trust anybody today.

363
00:14:17,507 --> 00:14:18,773
Get to your point, Karev.

364
00:14:18,842 --> 00:14:20,252
I just don't want
to screw this up.

365
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:21,487
We got to be the perfect team.

366
00:14:21,511 --> 00:14:23,506
And you're not comfortable
doing it with her?

367
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:24,957
She's making
everybody uncomfortable.

368
00:14:24,981 --> 00:14:26,459
I get it. You don't need
to say another word.

369
00:14:26,483 --> 00:14:28,783
Who wants to replace
Karev on the flip?

370
00:14:28,869 --> 00:14:30,034
No, that's not what I meant.

371
00:14:30,103 --> 00:14:31,602
I'll do it, sir.

372
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:39,977
You sure you can do this?

373
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:42,213
Disconnect and
cap Subclavian IVs,

374
00:14:42,282 --> 00:14:44,415
anesthesiologist
holds the ET tube,

375
00:14:44,483 --> 00:14:47,552
designated circulators and
the techs hold the monitors.

376
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,697
Yours over mine, babies...

377
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:49,887
Don't. Don't.

378
00:14:49,956 --> 00:14:51,767
Why aren't you doing the flip?

379
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:53,240
Webber snaked it from me.

380
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:54,871
Webber? But he hasn't practiced.

381
00:14:54,895 --> 00:14:56,805
You've been practicing
this for two weeks.

382
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:57,895
Yeah, tell him that.

383
00:14:57,964 --> 00:15:00,243
I told the parents
that you've practiced.

384
00:15:00,267 --> 00:15:02,495
I told them that you
had this thing down cold.

385
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:06,471
Okay, one, two, three.

386
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:11,325
Easy, easy, easy.

387
00:15:12,128 --> 00:15:13,611
I hope he drops her.

388
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,824
How's he gonna like it when
one twin's pushing her sister

389
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:17,488
in a wheelchair the
rest of their lives?

390
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:20,298
I'm just pissed at Webber.

391
00:15:20,352 --> 00:15:22,036
You're just a monster.

392
00:15:22,122 --> 00:15:23,282
And we're done.

393
00:15:25,175 --> 00:15:26,190
All right!

394
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:27,792
Good. Okay.

395
00:15:28,495 --> 00:15:29,495
Nice work.

396
00:15:29,562 --> 00:15:31,212
Well done. All right!

397
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:35,516
He flatlined again.

398
00:15:35,585 --> 00:15:37,763
Then Dr. Webber and I decided
that without any blood left to circulate,

399
00:15:37,787 --> 00:15:41,121
his heart would not restart, so
we called time of death at 8:52 p.m.

400
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:44,575
Tell me about the tumor.

401
00:15:44,644 --> 00:15:46,844
The tumor had eroded
through the pulmonary artery.

402
00:15:48,765 --> 00:15:49,880
Okay.

403
00:15:52,468 --> 00:15:54,263
How do you know? Know what?

404
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:58,673
When you say that the tumor
eroded into the pulmonary artery...

405
00:15:58,742 --> 00:16:00,502
how do you know? There
was a hole in the artery.

406
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:02,160
Did you actually see the artery?

407
00:16:02,228 --> 00:16:04,228
I felt it. You just
blindly felt it?

408
00:16:05,564 --> 00:16:07,098
It wasn't a blind feel.

409
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:09,533
I knew what I was doing.
I traced it with my fingers.

410
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:14,321
Uh-huh.

411
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,318
It was the posterior
segmental artery. I'm sure of it.

412
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:18,142
How can you be sure?

413
00:16:18,211 --> 00:16:20,745
You never got a visual.

414
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,992
I followed the
tracheal bifurcation.

415
00:16:23,016 --> 00:16:25,227
It came directly off the
main pulmonary artery.

416
00:16:25,251 --> 00:16:27,952
Okay, Kepner, let's get a few
of these lymph nodes for biopsy

417
00:16:28,021 --> 00:16:29,353
and then get ready to close.

418
00:16:33,259 --> 00:16:35,619
I didn't call it
without being sure.

419
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:38,846
From the top, Yang.

420
00:16:43,403 --> 00:16:44,669
Um...

421
00:16:44,738 --> 00:16:47,321
His vitals were stable
after receiving fluids.

422
00:16:47,389 --> 00:16:49,207
He was under anesthesia,

423
00:16:49,275 --> 00:16:51,503
and the bronch was placed
when I entered the OR.

424
00:16:51,527 --> 00:16:55,929
So I proceeded with the laser
endoscopy using the CO2 laser.

425
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,385
Dr. Bailey, op notes done.

426
00:17:01,454 --> 00:17:02,648
Do you mind if I
run out for a minute

427
00:17:02,672 --> 00:17:03,816
until the next patient's ready?

428
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,672
He's gonna be here
30 minutes from now.

429
00:17:05,741 --> 00:17:06,885
I know. I can get out and
make it back in that time.

430
00:17:06,909 --> 00:17:08,725
You're going to try
and get a sandwich

431
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:11,829
then I'm going to get the
sad story 40 minutes from now

432
00:17:11,898 --> 00:17:13,442
about how long the
line was in the cafeteria.

433
00:17:13,466 --> 00:17:15,961
He's a nice man. You could
do without me for half an hour.

434
00:17:15,985 --> 00:17:17,001
Dr. Grey.

435
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:18,149
He won't bite.

436
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:21,973
For God's sake.

437
00:17:23,676 --> 00:17:25,876
You can run, but you can't hide.

438
00:17:28,398 --> 00:17:30,864
Look, what we have is good.

439
00:17:30,933 --> 00:17:35,887
Now why on Earth do you
want to rush it and complicate it

440
00:17:35,955 --> 00:17:37,588
and quite possibly destroy it?

441
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:39,451
Because we're not kids anymore.

442
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:41,992
Because my life
is happening now.

443
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,939
Not 10 years from now or five

444
00:17:43,963 --> 00:17:47,147
or a respectable 14
months, but right now.

445
00:17:47,216 --> 00:17:51,018
And I want to share it, every
day, every morning, every evening,

446
00:17:51,086 --> 00:17:52,864
and if that's not what you want,

447
00:17:52,888 --> 00:17:54,366
then I guess we're just
not right for each other.

448
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:56,418
Now, look, we just got
back together two weeks ago.

449
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:57,675
I can't...

450
00:17:57,744 --> 00:17:59,984
Well, I guess I
just got my answer.

451
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,931
Hey... It's been two weeks.

452
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,139
Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.

453
00:18:15,161 --> 00:18:17,161
Okay. Look at this face.

454
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:20,314
Seriously, look at this face.

455
00:18:20,383 --> 00:18:21,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah, super-cute.

456
00:18:21,784 --> 00:18:23,795
They're in the spinal cord now.

457
00:18:23,819 --> 00:18:25,097
Bailey spent the last two hours

458
00:18:25,121 --> 00:18:26,331
telling me how
crappy my life is,

459
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:28,372
but look at this face.

460
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:30,107
Oh, Zola, look.
There's your daddy.

461
00:18:30,176 --> 00:18:32,443
He's about to repair
a myelomeningocele.

462
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:33,605
Can you say myelomeningocele?

463
00:18:33,629 --> 00:18:35,591
What an ass. Hey, language.

464
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:36,615
Baby here.

465
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:38,210
He pretends he's
all gentle and sad

466
00:18:38,234 --> 00:18:40,618
with the Alzie wife at home,
dispensing Zen wisdom

467
00:18:40,686 --> 00:18:42,681
from his half-century
of being a surgeon.

468
00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:43,865
Well, guess what?

469
00:18:43,889 --> 00:18:47,024
Yoda down there,
biggest shark of them all.

470
00:18:47,093 --> 00:18:49,260
The guy is dangerous and mean.

471
00:18:49,329 --> 00:18:50,872
I think what Teddy's
doing is mean.

472
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:51,896
It's fine.

473
00:18:51,948 --> 00:18:52,992
No, it's horrible.

474
00:18:53,016 --> 00:18:54,248
It's horrible and...

475
00:18:54,316 --> 00:18:55,561
You know what else is horrible?

476
00:18:55,585 --> 00:18:56,895
Having a dead husband.
No, you know what?

477
00:18:56,919 --> 00:18:59,220
You don't know,
okay? It's not right.

478
00:18:59,288 --> 00:19:00,528
Teddy's OR, it's like...

479
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:03,057
It's like a morgue.

480
00:19:03,126 --> 00:19:05,904
Well, Altman's husband died on
Yang's table. Payback's a bitch.

481
00:19:05,928 --> 00:19:08,495
Oh, will you just
shut up? It's fine.

482
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:10,164
I can handle it.

483
00:19:10,233 --> 00:19:12,711
Well, it has been two weeks
of this. It must be getting to you.

484
00:19:12,735 --> 00:19:15,514
No more than it did
yesterday or the day before that

485
00:19:15,538 --> 00:19:17,498
or the day before
that. It's fine.

486
00:19:17,807 --> 00:19:18,906
I can handle it.

487
00:19:18,974 --> 00:19:21,275
<i>Damn it. Spinal dermoid cyst.</i>

488
00:19:21,343 --> 00:19:23,410
<i>It's all tangled up
in the spinal root.</i>

489
00:19:23,479 --> 00:19:25,073
Yeah, there's a lot of scarring in
there. I don't see a clean approach.

490
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:26,475
Well, no, you
have to take it out,

491
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:27,592
because the cyst could
become malignant.

492
00:19:27,616 --> 00:19:29,061
Yes, we're aware. Thank you.

493
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:31,702
Maybe if I can come in
from an angle like this,

494
00:19:31,771 --> 00:19:34,205
but then we risk the
contents spilling out...

495
00:19:34,274 --> 00:19:36,134
Which could cause
a chemical meningitis.

496
00:19:36,158 --> 00:19:38,792
Dr. Robbins, we've got this.

497
00:19:38,861 --> 00:19:40,672
Okay, what if we stretch
the nerve root here?

498
00:19:40,696 --> 00:19:42,312
Well, that might
paralyze Brandi.

499
00:19:42,382 --> 00:19:44,860
Yes, Brandi might
end up paralyzed.

500
00:19:44,884 --> 00:19:46,611
Yeah, no one understands
that better than we do,

501
00:19:46,635 --> 00:19:48,897
which is why we will be
making this decision, okay?

502
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:50,188
Us. Not you.

503
00:19:50,256 --> 00:19:52,239
Us. You all right with that?

504
00:19:52,308 --> 00:19:53,758
Just make sure that...

505
00:19:57,597 --> 00:19:58,645
Yes, I'm okay with that.

506
00:19:58,714 --> 00:20:01,131
No more talking from
anyone in this OR.

507
00:20:01,183 --> 00:20:03,183
We need complete
silence from now on.

508
00:20:07,189 --> 00:20:08,489
Hey.

509
00:20:08,558 --> 00:20:11,492
I was in the shop downstairs,
and I figured, you know,

510
00:20:11,578 --> 00:20:13,177
now there's gonna
be two of them,

511
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:15,479
they're gonna need
their own clothes.

512
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:18,115
So I figured Brandi
could be the punk first

513
00:20:18,184 --> 00:20:19,344
and then we could
make them switch

514
00:20:19,368 --> 00:20:20,848
and see which one
wears them better.

515
00:20:23,172 --> 00:20:24,288
I love you.

516
00:20:24,356 --> 00:20:25,372
I love you, too.

517
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:39,971
Oh!

518
00:20:40,022 --> 00:20:44,475
Uh, they're about to
separate the girls, which is so

519
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:46,544
cool. It...

520
00:20:51,618 --> 00:20:53,498
Okay, we're ready
for the final cut.

521
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:07,064
All right. Separation complete.

522
00:21:08,368 --> 00:21:09,844
No, no, no. Not yet, not yet.

523
00:21:09,868 --> 00:21:11,280
We still need to check
on the motor function.

524
00:21:11,304 --> 00:21:13,070
Let's do

525
00:21:13,139 --> 00:21:16,274
2 milliamps of stimulation
on Andi first, please.

526
00:21:20,462 --> 00:21:21,557
All right.

527
00:21:21,581 --> 00:21:22,841
<i>All right. Let's try Brandi now.</i>

528
00:21:22,865 --> 00:21:24,047
<i>2 milliamps of stimulation.</i>

529
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:32,830
Let's go up to 3
milliamps, please.

530
00:21:42,101 --> 00:21:44,212
Come on, Brandi. Just give
us some kind of movement.

531
00:21:44,236 --> 00:21:45,236
Anything.

532
00:21:53,696 --> 00:21:55,856
<i>All right. Let's go to 4
milliamps of stimulation.</i>

533
00:22:08,761 --> 00:22:10,494
Hey, there you go.

534
00:22:15,717 --> 00:22:17,662
Great work, everyone.
One step at a time,

535
00:22:17,686 --> 00:22:19,364
by the numbers,
like we practiced.

536
00:22:19,388 --> 00:22:20,388
Let's move.

537
00:22:26,045 --> 00:22:29,964
Okay, count of three. One,
two, three. Gently. Nicely done.

538
00:22:35,153 --> 00:22:36,498
We've still got a hell
of a long way to go.

539
00:22:36,522 --> 00:22:37,842
I'll be checking in on you both.

540
00:22:43,796 --> 00:22:45,473
How's it going in here, Sloan?

541
00:22:45,497 --> 00:22:48,610
The flap is well-vascularized,
has good cap refill,

542
00:22:48,634 --> 00:22:50,935
and is covering
the defect perfectly.

543
00:22:51,003 --> 00:22:52,123
I nailed it.

544
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:53,705
Did Avery nail his?

545
00:22:59,228 --> 00:23:01,306
What's going on, Avery? You
should've finished your flap by now.

546
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:03,247
Yet I haven't even started.

547
00:23:03,316 --> 00:23:05,616
Why don't you give me
a call when you're ready?

548
00:23:05,684 --> 00:23:07,195
Her kidney's
completely necrotic.

549
00:23:08,487 --> 00:23:09,514
V-tach.

550
00:23:09,538 --> 00:23:10,615
Okay, push 30
milligrams of calcium.

551
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:12,400
She's already showing
signs of renal failure.

552
00:23:12,424 --> 00:23:13,919
Her kidney was fine earlier.

553
00:23:13,943 --> 00:23:15,721
Maybe something
caused an arterial spasm

554
00:23:15,745 --> 00:23:16,805
while we were checking the
function of the blood supply.

555
00:23:16,829 --> 00:23:17,873
I don't know, but at this point,

556
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:19,847
I don't think it's salvageable.

557
00:23:19,915 --> 00:23:21,175
She hasn't had any urine
output since she's been in this OR.

558
00:23:21,199 --> 00:23:22,415
How did it happen?

559
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:24,296
Sometimes
complications can arise.

560
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,153
I didn't even want this.

561
00:23:26,222 --> 00:23:29,857
I mean, you people, you
doctors talked us into this.

562
00:23:29,925 --> 00:23:31,942
You promised us
that you could do this.

563
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:33,338
So what are you
saying, Dr. Grey?

564
00:23:33,362 --> 00:23:36,296
She's saying that our
perfectly healthy daughter

565
00:23:36,365 --> 00:23:38,165
started the day
sharing three kidneys

566
00:23:38,234 --> 00:23:40,367
and now she only has one,
which isn't even working.

567
00:23:41,721 --> 00:23:44,437
Which basically
means she has none.

568
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:45,822
That's what she's telling you.

569
00:23:45,891 --> 00:23:47,023
Can they fix it?

570
00:23:48,244 --> 00:23:50,978
Is Brandi gonna be okay?

571
00:23:51,046 --> 00:23:54,615
We don't know yet. We're
just gonna have to wait and see.

572
00:24:01,724 --> 00:24:04,269
17-year-old male with
multiple GSW to the chest.

573
00:24:04,293 --> 00:24:05,654
We're bringing him
straight from the ER,

574
00:24:05,678 --> 00:24:07,377
so we don't have a
lot of time, people.

575
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:08,490
Get him on the table.

576
00:24:08,514 --> 00:24:09,825
Dr. Yang, are you
scrubbing in this time?

577
00:24:09,849 --> 00:24:11,209
No. No.

578
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:13,370
All right, on my
count. One, two, three.

579
00:24:14,253 --> 00:24:15,493
Let's move, Kepner.

580
00:24:28,734 --> 00:24:31,034
Yang.

581
00:24:31,103 --> 00:24:33,832
Vitals were stable after
receiving L.R. and packed cells.

582
00:24:33,856 --> 00:24:36,101
The bronch was already placed
when I entered into the OR.

583
00:24:36,125 --> 00:24:38,565
So I proceeded with
the laser endoscopy.

584
00:24:40,662 --> 00:24:42,374
How was your lunch, Dr. Grey?

585
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:44,681
Oh, it was fine.
Actually, no line at all.

586
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:46,762
I was able to get my sandwich,

587
00:24:46,786 --> 00:24:48,747
find my daughter,
see my husband,

588
00:24:48,771 --> 00:24:50,481
go watch the
groundbreaking surgery

589
00:24:50,505 --> 00:24:52,400
that's going on right next door,

590
00:24:52,424 --> 00:24:55,375
and still get back in
time to do my work.

591
00:24:55,444 --> 00:24:57,811
Sounds like you
have it all, Dr. Grey.

592
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,391
I do, actually. I have it all.

593
00:24:59,415 --> 00:25:00,959
I've heard enough
about the lunch.

594
00:25:00,983 --> 00:25:03,433
I don't see anymore perforations.
I'm gonna start closing.

595
00:25:03,503 --> 00:25:05,530
I'd say we should grab
a drink and celebrate,

596
00:25:05,554 --> 00:25:08,874
but I know you don't have
room in your life for joy.

597
00:25:10,275 --> 00:25:15,245
Is it a crime that I like to focus
when I'm in the workplace?

598
00:25:15,314 --> 00:25:17,748
If so, my apologies.

599
00:25:17,817 --> 00:25:21,519
I focus. I focus like a laser.

600
00:25:21,587 --> 00:25:24,071
That's why I don't
make mistakes.

601
00:25:24,139 --> 00:25:27,224
That's why my
patients survive surgery.

602
00:25:27,292 --> 00:25:30,660
That's why I'm not
sloppy or careless...

603
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:31,911
We're missing a sponge.

604
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:34,643
Or inconsistent, like
many of my colleagues are.

605
00:25:34,667 --> 00:25:36,683
Frankly, like most
of my students are.

606
00:25:36,752 --> 00:25:39,035
When you and
Chatty Cathy over here

607
00:25:39,104 --> 00:25:42,106
we're discussing
the magic of lunch,

608
00:25:42,157 --> 00:25:44,257
I was focused
enough for both of us.

609
00:25:44,327 --> 00:25:45,537
Dr. Bailey. What?

610
00:25:45,561 --> 00:25:46,893
We're missing a sponge.

611
00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:51,715
Well, count again.

612
00:25:51,784 --> 00:25:54,435
We did. Three times. We've
looked everywhere except...

613
00:25:55,137 --> 00:25:56,153
Except where?

614
00:25:59,908 --> 00:26:01,041
Inside the patient.

615
00:26:06,164 --> 00:26:07,564
Did you clear out the clots?

616
00:26:07,633 --> 00:26:08,893
Yeah. OWEN: Were
there any adhesions?

617
00:26:08,917 --> 00:26:10,929
No, the vessels are clear,
and yet the kidney is dead.

618
00:26:10,953 --> 00:26:12,948
What if we tried a bypass graft?

619
00:26:12,972 --> 00:26:14,521
A kidney transplant.

620
00:26:14,589 --> 00:26:16,485
We've got the perfectly
matched donor right next door.

621
00:26:16,509 --> 00:26:18,202
They used to share all
three of those kidneys.

622
00:26:18,226 --> 00:26:19,738
There'd be no need
for immunosuppressants

623
00:26:19,762 --> 00:26:20,856
because they're identical twins.

624
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,412
They'd be saving each other.

625
00:26:22,481 --> 00:26:24,548
Okay, Karev. It's your
idea. Make it happen.

626
00:26:32,191 --> 00:26:34,742
The parents wanted to see
her before she went up to PICU.

627
00:26:35,627 --> 00:26:36,876
She looks so weird.

628
00:26:36,945 --> 00:26:37,995
Where's her sister?

629
00:26:42,585 --> 00:26:44,417
I cannot look at her
without her sister.

630
00:26:44,486 --> 00:26:47,406
Honey, Brandi's gonna
be fine. She'll be here, too.

631
00:26:48,173 --> 00:26:50,056
They're both gonna be fine.

632
00:26:50,125 --> 00:26:51,836
We need Andi back in the OR.

633
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,760
What's wrong?

634
00:26:53,829 --> 00:26:55,440
We're gonna do a kidney
transplant. Brandi's kidney failed.

635
00:26:55,464 --> 00:26:57,208
It's straining her other
organs, including her heart.

636
00:26:57,232 --> 00:26:59,294
No, you can't. EVANS:
It's okay. Let them take her.

637
00:26:59,318 --> 00:27:01,384
I can't lose them both.
Please. No. You can't.

638
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:05,606
Please. I cannot lose
them both. Please. No.

639
00:27:14,733 --> 00:27:16,077
How much longer?
You need me to scrub in?

640
00:27:16,101 --> 00:27:17,384
Almost there.

641
00:27:17,452 --> 00:27:18,613
Well, can you be almost
there a little faster?

642
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:19,720
There. Got it.

643
00:27:24,493 --> 00:27:26,443
Thank you.

644
00:27:26,512 --> 00:27:28,552
Open the frigging door. Okay.

645
00:27:33,085 --> 00:27:34,196
Kidney looks healthy.
Are you ready?

646
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:36,660
Yeah. Go ahead and scrub in.

647
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:47,292
Vitals were stable after
receiving L.R. and packed cells.

648
00:27:47,316 --> 00:27:49,945
The bronchoscope was already
in place when I entered the OR,

649
00:27:49,969 --> 00:27:52,114
so I started with
the laser endoscopy.

650
00:27:52,138 --> 00:27:54,988
I had good visualization of
the tumor almost immediately.

651
00:27:55,056 --> 00:27:56,139
Tell me about the tumor.

652
00:27:56,208 --> 00:27:57,385
It was highly vascularized

653
00:27:57,409 --> 00:27:59,154
and had eroded through
the pulmonary artery.

654
00:27:59,178 --> 00:28:00,788
How do you know? I felt it.

655
00:28:00,812 --> 00:28:02,223
What did you feel? A hole
in the pulmonary artery.

656
00:28:02,247 --> 00:28:03,625
Are you sure that it was
the pulmonary artery?

657
00:28:03,649 --> 00:28:05,226
Yes. Or did you
just blindly feel it?

658
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:06,895
I knew what I was
doing and what I felt.

659
00:28:06,919 --> 00:28:08,497
You had your hand on
it? I had my hand on it...

660
00:28:08,521 --> 00:28:09,631
and traced the anatomy.

661
00:28:09,655 --> 00:28:10,687
Are you 100% sure?

662
00:28:10,756 --> 00:28:11,916
She said she's sure!

663
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:17,544
Enough! It's enough! This is
enough! You can't keep doing this.

664
00:28:17,613 --> 00:28:19,146
You can't...

665
00:28:20,349 --> 00:28:21,898
He's gone.

666
00:28:21,967 --> 00:28:24,968
Dr. Altman, I'm
sorry, but he's gone,

667
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:27,115
and this is not
gonna bring him back,

668
00:28:27,139 --> 00:28:28,339
so please just stop.

669
00:28:29,808 --> 00:28:31,074
Please.

670
00:28:33,762 --> 00:28:36,079
Are you all right, Dr. Kepner,

671
00:28:36,148 --> 00:28:38,681
or do you need time
to gather yourself?

672
00:28:43,205 --> 00:28:44,470
No...

673
00:28:46,008 --> 00:28:47,040
No.

674
00:28:48,194 --> 00:28:49,560
Okay, then.

675
00:28:52,681 --> 00:28:54,314
I am 100% sure.

676
00:28:58,537 --> 00:29:00,003
All right.

677
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:01,312
Henry flatlined.

678
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:03,218
We did compressions, pushed epi,

679
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:05,420
got a sinus brady,
pushed high-dose epi.

680
00:29:05,444 --> 00:29:07,911
He flatlined again. We
did more compressions.

681
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:10,497
We continued in this manner
until both Dr. Webber and I

682
00:29:10,566 --> 00:29:12,727
decided that his
heart would not start.

683
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:14,791
We called time of
death at 8:52 p.m.

684
00:29:28,133 --> 00:29:30,433
You have every reason to
be pissed with me, Karev.

685
00:29:32,153 --> 00:29:34,220
I played you.

686
00:29:34,289 --> 00:29:37,089
I wanted in on that surgery,
and I looked for the weakest link,

687
00:29:37,125 --> 00:29:39,843
and it was you.

688
00:29:39,912 --> 00:29:41,044
That's all right.

689
00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:42,578
Next time, I'll know better.

690
00:29:42,647 --> 00:29:44,447
It's not all right.

691
00:29:44,516 --> 00:29:48,251
That was your moment,
and I took it away from you.

692
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:52,589
What I did today was
sad. It was pathetic.

693
00:29:55,411 --> 00:29:57,371
An old man acting out of fear.

694
00:30:03,268 --> 00:30:05,708
You get to a point
in your career...

695
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:09,639
Hell, in your life,

696
00:30:09,708 --> 00:30:12,709
when you realize you got
more yesterdays than tomorrows.

697
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:16,439
And that realization
is hard on a man.

698
00:30:18,834 --> 00:30:22,074
But when you get a chance
to get in on something like that,

699
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:24,838
you fight like a tiger,

700
00:30:26,408 --> 00:30:28,252
all because you
think it'll give you

701
00:30:28,276 --> 00:30:30,316
just a little more
time in the game.

702
00:30:32,364 --> 00:30:34,298
I don't think you have
to worry about that.

703
00:30:34,366 --> 00:30:35,526
You kidding?

704
00:30:37,102 --> 00:30:40,170
A year from now,
maybe two if I'm lucky,

705
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:43,218
they'll stick me in
an office in a part of

706
00:30:43,242 --> 00:30:45,402
the hospital
nobody ever goes to.

707
00:30:46,228 --> 00:30:49,429
They'll appoint me to
some do-nothing board

708
00:30:49,498 --> 00:30:51,931
that makes up rules
nobody pays attention to.

709
00:30:54,202 --> 00:30:55,613
They'll let me do a
couple of appys a week,

710
00:30:55,637 --> 00:30:57,797
so I can still call
myself a surgeon.

711
00:31:00,509 --> 00:31:02,829
You reach a certain
age, that's what happens.

712
00:31:05,997 --> 00:31:07,598
It's the order of things.

713
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:13,803
I can't think of anything
more humiliating.

714
00:31:17,309 --> 00:31:18,358
Can you?

715
00:31:20,161 --> 00:31:21,194
No.

716
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:29,168
Hey, you want to scrub
in on the transplant?

717
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:32,071
Robbins just needs one of us.

718
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,506
Go ahead.

719
00:31:33,575 --> 00:31:34,974
Really?

720
00:31:35,043 --> 00:31:37,043
Go on, or I'm gonna
change my mind.

721
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,913
I don't know...

722
00:31:47,389 --> 00:31:48,888
Thanks, Karev.

723
00:31:57,082 --> 00:32:03,987
36, 37, 38, 39... Nope.
The X-rays are here.

724
00:32:04,055 --> 00:32:06,256
Look, keep looking.

725
00:32:06,325 --> 00:32:09,125
Dr. Bailey, we have to close.
He's been under too long.

726
00:32:09,194 --> 00:32:10,621
You have boards coming up.

727
00:32:10,645 --> 00:32:12,605
Is this really what you
want on your record?

728
00:32:14,532 --> 00:32:16,767
Well, don't just stand
there like a whipped puppy.

729
00:32:16,835 --> 00:32:18,018
Check under the liver again.

730
00:32:18,087 --> 00:32:19,247
It's not under the liver.

731
00:32:19,271 --> 00:32:20,304
Excuse me?

732
00:32:20,372 --> 00:32:22,538
It's not in the patient.

733
00:32:22,608 --> 00:32:27,043
Dr. Grey, I thought I taught
you the simple, reliable rules,

734
00:32:27,112 --> 00:32:28,911
like when you don't
find the problem

735
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,731
on your first look, check again.

736
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:32,699
Double-check,
triple-check if you have to.

737
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:35,969
We don't throw our hands up in
my OR when a man's life is at stake.

738
00:32:38,106 --> 00:32:40,540
Dr. Bailey, the sponge is
on the bottom of your shoe.

739
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:42,892
On the...

740
00:32:49,067 --> 00:32:51,351
Focus, like a laser.

741
00:33:01,296 --> 00:33:02,940
Why aren't we getting any urine?

742
00:33:02,964 --> 00:33:05,998
There's a kink in the
vessels. Papaverine, please.

743
00:33:06,068 --> 00:33:08,167
Hey, why are you
doing this and not Karev?

744
00:33:08,237 --> 00:33:09,864
He was the one who
suggested the transplant.

745
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:11,438
I picked Karev's pocket.

746
00:33:14,576 --> 00:33:15,576
You what?

747
00:33:15,644 --> 00:33:17,727
Twice in one day, Karev?

748
00:33:17,795 --> 00:33:19,845
Honest to God.

749
00:33:19,914 --> 00:33:21,792
It was like taking
candy from a baby.

750
00:33:21,816 --> 00:33:24,167
No, that's not right.
It's not fair to the baby.

751
00:33:24,236 --> 00:33:27,098
It was easier than
taking candy from a baby.

752
00:33:27,122 --> 00:33:29,839
At least the baby
puts up a bit of a fight.

753
00:33:30,993 --> 00:33:33,443
Removing clamp.

754
00:33:33,512 --> 00:33:35,352
Yes! We got it! We have urine.

755
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:36,500
The kidney's working!

756
00:33:36,532 --> 00:33:37,563
We did it.

757
00:33:38,166 --> 00:33:39,399
Good job.

758
00:33:40,818 --> 00:33:43,019
Dr. Webber exercised his
judgment and stepped in.

759
00:33:43,088 --> 00:33:46,023
So we cracked his chest and
tried to tamponade the bleeding

760
00:33:46,091 --> 00:33:47,790
and get to the source.

761
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:50,810
He became bradycardic,
so we pushed atropine.

762
00:33:50,879 --> 00:33:53,779
I then realized he had lost
so much blood, because...

763
00:33:53,848 --> 00:33:56,783
The tumor had eroded
through the pulmonary artery.

764
00:34:04,409 --> 00:34:05,620
Right. That's when he flatlined.

765
00:34:05,644 --> 00:34:06,843
We did compressions...

766
00:34:06,912 --> 00:34:08,139
Pushed epi, got a sinus brady...

767
00:34:08,163 --> 00:34:09,496
Push high-dose epi...

768
00:34:10,532 --> 00:34:12,772
Which is when
he flatlined again.

769
00:34:13,835 --> 00:34:14,835
Yes.

770
00:34:16,921 --> 00:34:21,258
And you and Dr. Webber agreed
that he had lost too much blood.

771
00:34:21,326 --> 00:34:22,559
Yes.

772
00:34:22,627 --> 00:34:25,712
And didn't have
enough left to circulate,

773
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:28,882
so his heart would not restart.

774
00:34:28,950 --> 00:34:30,016
Yes.

775
00:34:34,456 --> 00:34:36,189
So you called time of death.

776
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:39,179
8:52 p.m. 8:52 p.m.

777
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:52,839
I'm sorry.

778
00:34:52,907 --> 00:34:55,041
Oh, you don't apologize.

779
00:34:55,109 --> 00:34:57,610
You hear me? You
don't blame yourself.

780
00:34:59,748 --> 00:35:04,134
You did every single thing
that I would have done.

781
00:35:04,202 --> 00:35:06,819
You were me in that OR.

782
00:35:06,888 --> 00:35:09,622
You were good
and you did it right.

783
00:35:10,425 --> 00:35:11,757
He just...

784
00:35:13,761 --> 00:35:15,094
He just...

785
00:35:20,986 --> 00:35:22,868
He just died.

786
00:36:01,109 --> 00:36:04,844
I had a husband and a
baby and I was a surgeon.

787
00:36:04,913 --> 00:36:06,846
I had it all.

788
00:36:06,915 --> 00:36:10,033
And then it all turned bad.

789
00:36:11,019 --> 00:36:13,152
So I got divorced.

790
00:36:13,221 --> 00:36:16,256
And then I got back
on my feet, I found you,

791
00:36:17,826 --> 00:36:21,027
and then there was a shooting.

792
00:36:21,096 --> 00:36:27,533
So now I am finally back on my
feet, again, and I have you again.

793
00:36:34,059 --> 00:36:35,759
I just don't want it to blow up.

794
00:36:35,827 --> 00:36:38,544
Okay. You're scared.

795
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:41,614
See, all right,
and now I am, too.

796
00:36:41,683 --> 00:36:43,494
Why can't we be scared
in the same house?

797
00:36:43,518 --> 00:36:45,669
Well, don't act like
it's not complicated.

798
00:36:45,737 --> 00:36:48,683
It's not complicated. We
just take it one step at a time.

799
00:36:48,707 --> 00:36:51,357
Put a toothbrush
in my house today.

800
00:36:51,426 --> 00:36:53,070
Tomorrow, maybe a
couple pairs of socks.

801
00:36:53,094 --> 00:36:54,738
Then a suitcase
on the weekend...

802
00:36:54,762 --> 00:36:58,281
I have a child. I can't
just move in with you.

803
00:36:58,350 --> 00:36:59,665
Wait. You have a child?

804
00:36:59,734 --> 00:37:01,233
Whoa! When did that happen?

805
00:37:01,303 --> 00:37:02,852
Stop. You are not a funny man.

806
00:37:02,921 --> 00:37:05,738
I met him. Rick, right?

807
00:37:05,807 --> 00:37:07,952
It was a mistake to even
enter into this conversation.

808
00:37:07,976 --> 00:37:10,843
T. rex versus
Megalosaurus, who wins?

809
00:37:10,912 --> 00:37:12,111
Well, I have no idea.

810
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:13,512
You know who does?

811
00:37:13,581 --> 00:37:16,333
I do, and so does Tuck.

812
00:37:16,401 --> 00:37:17,679
Megalosaurus is
a tenth of the size.

813
00:37:17,703 --> 00:37:19,547
T. rex eats Megalo every time.

814
00:37:19,571 --> 00:37:21,382
But T. rex versus
Pteranodon, though...

815
00:37:21,406 --> 00:37:22,850
Ben... Pteranodon can fly.

816
00:37:22,874 --> 00:37:25,803
That's an easy win. Unless
you think that's a forfeit.

817
00:37:25,827 --> 00:37:28,161
Yeah, I can do this all
day, and so can Tuck.

818
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:31,510
You're bored already, and
we've been at it 30 seconds.

819
00:37:32,016 --> 00:37:33,917
I like Tuck.

820
00:37:33,985 --> 00:37:37,720
I like hanging out with Tuck. I
like dinosaurs and Transformers

821
00:37:38,657 --> 00:37:40,072
and I like you.

822
00:37:41,543 --> 00:37:43,910
I want the whole package.

823
00:37:47,716 --> 00:37:50,116
I know you don't
come without Tuck.

824
00:37:51,452 --> 00:37:52,612
I know that.

825
00:37:56,491 --> 00:37:57,731
I know who you are.

826
00:38:10,255 --> 00:38:11,455
So that's it?

827
00:38:12,724 --> 00:38:13,804
Nothing?

828
00:38:17,228 --> 00:38:19,912
My toothbrush is in my locker.

829
00:38:23,919 --> 00:38:25,652
One step at a time.

830
00:38:38,032 --> 00:38:39,131
Ooh!

831
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,983
Sorry, guys.

832
00:38:41,052 --> 00:38:44,103
Ha-ha! So that went well today.

833
00:38:44,172 --> 00:38:45,271
Hmm. You were a monster.

834
00:38:45,339 --> 00:38:47,273
No, no, no. I was amped up.

835
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:49,959
Okay.

836
00:38:50,028 --> 00:38:51,589
Yeah. I think people
found me helpful.

837
00:38:51,613 --> 00:38:52,613
Oh! Mmm-hmm. Okay.

838
00:38:53,248 --> 00:38:54,948
Okay. Anyways.

839
00:38:55,016 --> 00:38:56,743
I'm gonna go check on the
twins, then I'm gonna head home.

840
00:38:56,767 --> 00:38:59,213
Hey, could you put the
humidifier on in Sofia's room?

841
00:38:59,237 --> 00:39:00,881
She seemed a little
congested this morning.

842
00:39:00,905 --> 00:39:02,283
Yeah... Yeah, but don't
give her anything for it.

843
00:39:02,307 --> 00:39:04,135
I don't think we're
there yet. All right.

844
00:39:04,159 --> 00:39:05,253
Oh, and give her
the pink blanket

845
00:39:05,277 --> 00:39:06,421
that your friend Terry gave us.

846
00:39:06,445 --> 00:39:07,588
She likes that. No,
no, she doesn't...

847
00:39:07,612 --> 00:39:09,395
Yes, she does.

848
00:39:09,463 --> 00:39:10,607
And don't put it
on her directly,

849
00:39:10,631 --> 00:39:11,951
'cause she'll just fling it off.

850
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,016
Lay it down on top of
the sheet, fuzzy side up.

851
00:39:14,085 --> 00:39:16,869
Excuse me. This is
important. Are you getting this?

852
00:39:16,938 --> 00:39:18,688
Fuzzy side up, not down. Up.

853
00:39:18,756 --> 00:39:20,801
Not down, up. Not
down, up. Fine, fine, fine!

854
00:39:20,825 --> 00:39:21,957
My way. My way.

855
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:23,309
Fine, fine. Fine. Fine.

856
00:39:23,378 --> 00:39:25,278
I was a monster.

857
00:39:25,346 --> 00:39:26,479
Hey, Mike.

858
00:39:26,547 --> 00:39:28,130
Hey.

859
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:29,439
Mind if I get started?

860
00:39:29,501 --> 00:39:33,102
No, no, no, go ahead,
Mike. We were just leaving.

861
00:39:33,171 --> 00:39:35,755
Hey, I'll come see
the babies with you.

862
00:39:35,824 --> 00:39:38,290
Seriously, though, I'm
putting the humidifier on.

863
00:39:44,949 --> 00:39:47,550
<i>If only life was just
a dress rehearsal.</i>

864
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:53,222
<i>And we had time for do-overs.</i>

865
00:39:56,294 --> 00:39:59,055
That's something, isn't
it, Karev? What a surgery.

866
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:01,030
This is a teaching
hospital, okay?

867
00:40:01,099 --> 00:40:02,660
You were the chief for 20 years.

868
00:40:02,684 --> 00:40:04,796
You're supposed to be
teaching your residents.

869
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:07,386
Not stealing surgeries
like some shark fifth year.

870
00:40:07,455 --> 00:40:09,756
It's not cool,
okay? It's not fair.

871
00:40:11,843 --> 00:40:14,260
Oh, I think I taught
you something today.

872
00:40:14,328 --> 00:40:17,113
You don't give up a
once-in-a-lifetime surgery,

873
00:40:17,182 --> 00:40:20,933
not for any reason,
not for anyone, not ever.

874
00:40:26,941 --> 00:40:28,474
Watch your back, Karev.

875
00:40:28,543 --> 00:40:31,678
I may decide to teach
you something tomorrow.

876
00:40:31,746 --> 00:40:33,541
<i>We'd be able to
practice and practice</i>

877
00:40:33,565 --> 00:40:35,405
<i>every moment
until we got it right.</i>

878
00:40:38,303 --> 00:40:41,704
God, I wish you could've
been in there with me today.

879
00:40:42,407 --> 00:40:44,407
Really? Me, too.

880
00:40:45,677 --> 00:40:47,371
I'm sorry. I
wasn't... Oh! No, no.

881
00:40:47,395 --> 00:40:49,445
I'm sorry. I was hearing things.

882
00:40:49,514 --> 00:40:52,498
It was... Long day.
I'm just gonna... Okay.

883
00:40:52,567 --> 00:40:54,417
<i>Unfortunately,</i>

884
00:40:54,486 --> 00:40:57,403
<i>every day of our lives
is its own performance.</i>

885
00:40:57,471 --> 00:40:58,916
She's gonna need rehab,

886
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:01,057
but the fact that her
legs are moving already

887
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:02,358
is a really good sign.

888
00:41:02,427 --> 00:41:04,672
Is this a private party
or can anybody join in?

889
00:41:04,696 --> 00:41:08,081
Here you go. Brandi, meet Andi.

890
00:41:08,166 --> 00:41:10,560
She's the one who's been kicking
you in the ass your whole life.

891
00:41:10,584 --> 00:41:13,519
Can we... Is it okay
if we touch them?

892
00:41:13,588 --> 00:41:15,371
Of course you can.

893
00:41:16,907 --> 00:41:18,147
Charley, look at them.

894
00:41:18,176 --> 00:41:19,509
They're beautiful.

895
00:41:19,577 --> 00:41:21,889
Look at them. They're perfect.

896
00:41:21,913 --> 00:41:23,313
Hi.

897
00:41:23,381 --> 00:41:24,541
Hi.

898
00:41:26,885 --> 00:41:30,152
<i>It seems like even when we
get the chance to rehearse,</i>

899
00:41:30,221 --> 00:41:31,554
<i>and prepare,</i>

900
00:41:31,623 --> 00:41:33,723
<i>and practice...</i>

901
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:37,192
Sweetie, you have to
go to sleep. You have to.

902
00:41:37,261 --> 00:41:38,861
Just walk her around.

903
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:40,763
I am too tired to walk.

904
00:41:40,832 --> 00:41:42,032
Oh!

905
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:46,463
Is that from today? Mmm-hmm.

906
00:41:46,487 --> 00:41:48,471
She looks bigger.

907
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:50,139
Hey, are you getting bigger?

908
00:41:50,208 --> 00:41:52,675
She is getting bigger.
She looks bigger.

909
00:41:52,743 --> 00:41:54,143
Mmm-hmm.

910
00:41:54,212 --> 00:41:56,262
<i>Come on. Come get
the giraffe. Come on.</i>

911
00:41:56,330 --> 00:41:58,414
<i>You're just the cutest
kid on the entire planet.</i>

912
00:41:58,483 --> 00:41:59,782
<i>Why is that?</i>

913
00:41:59,851 --> 00:42:01,529
Oh, Derek, Derek. She's
walking. Where's the...

914
00:42:01,553 --> 00:42:03,447
Where's the camera? Turn it on.

915
00:42:03,471 --> 00:42:04,887
Hi. Hi, baby.

916
00:42:04,956 --> 00:42:06,333
I can't open it.
I can't open it.

917
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:08,107
Hi, baby Zola. Hi, baby.

918
00:42:08,176 --> 00:42:10,343
I can't... Oh, gosh.
Turn it on! Turn it on!

919
00:42:10,428 --> 00:42:12,423
I can't get it on!
I can't get it on!

920
00:42:12,447 --> 00:42:14,180
There. Walk for me.

921
00:42:14,249 --> 00:42:16,660
<i>We're still never quite ready
for life's grand moments.</i>

922
00:42:16,684 --> 00:42:19,004
Oh, my goodness.
Oh, I missed it!

923
00:42:20,121 --> 00:42:21,386
Good girl!
