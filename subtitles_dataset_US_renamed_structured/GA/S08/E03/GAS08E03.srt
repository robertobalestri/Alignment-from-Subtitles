1
00:00:03,637 --> 00:00:06,571
<i>You work, you
study, you prepare...</i>

2
00:00:08,042 --> 00:00:11,076
<i>Months and years
leading to one day...</i>

3
00:00:12,046 --> 00:00:13,979
<i>The day when you step up.</i>

4
00:00:14,048 --> 00:00:15,888
Okay, let's get started.

5
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:17,999
Yeah, let's do it.

6
00:00:18,068 --> 00:00:20,068
Got a lot of standing
around to do today.

7
00:00:20,137 --> 00:00:21,536
He's right, people.

8
00:00:21,605 --> 00:00:24,565
Starting today, fifth-year
residents rotate in as lead surgeons.

9
00:00:24,608 --> 00:00:26,225
We've alerted the morgue.

10
00:00:26,293 --> 00:00:28,538
<i>On that day, you have
to be ready for anything.</i>

11
00:00:28,562 --> 00:00:30,946
Attendings, you will
observe and stay silent.

12
00:00:31,032 --> 00:00:33,865
Offer help only when
you absolutely have to.

13
00:00:33,934 --> 00:00:36,985
Yeah, before you help them
swim, let 'em sink a little.

14
00:00:37,054 --> 00:00:39,515
<i>But there's one thing you
can never quite prepare for...</i>

15
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:43,358
The next order of business,
effective 9:00 a.m., this morning,

16
00:00:43,426 --> 00:00:45,404
I have resigned
as Chief of Surgery

17
00:00:45,428 --> 00:00:47,329
of Seattle Grace-Mercy
West Hospital.

18
00:00:47,397 --> 00:00:49,681
I will stay on
the surgical staff.

19
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:53,218
I will turn this meeting over
to the new Chief of Surgery,

20
00:00:53,287 --> 00:00:54,469
Dr. Owen Hunt.

21
00:00:54,538 --> 00:00:57,656
<i>The day when you step down.</i>

22
00:00:57,725 --> 00:00:59,602
Thanks, Dr. Webber.
I know this comes

23
00:00:59,626 --> 00:01:01,438
as a surprise
to all of you, too.

24
00:01:01,462 --> 00:01:03,457
And I appreciate, over
the next couple of days,

25
00:01:03,481 --> 00:01:05,697
your help and your patience.

26
00:01:05,766 --> 00:01:08,961
So, now I have your call
schedules, but I can have them...

27
00:01:08,985 --> 00:01:10,235
Wait. What happened?

28
00:01:10,971 --> 00:01:12,437
Why did it happen?

29
00:01:12,506 --> 00:01:15,540
Is this the board? Are they
forcing you to step down?

30
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,175
Hmm?

31
00:01:18,279 --> 00:01:20,946
Hunt. You're the
new Chief of Surgery.

32
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:22,714
Nice.

33
00:01:34,811 --> 00:01:37,279
Hey. What's going on?
Anything new on Zola?

34
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:38,724
Oh, no. We were
supposed to hear yesterday,

35
00:01:38,748 --> 00:01:40,527
and then yesterday, they
said today, so is it up yet?

36
00:01:40,551 --> 00:01:42,384
Don't know. You okay?

37
00:01:42,452 --> 00:01:45,097
I have no choice. I'm clipping
my first aneurysm today.

38
00:01:45,121 --> 00:01:47,389
Well, I've got a
valve replacement.

39
00:01:47,458 --> 00:01:50,859
My valve replacement. Altman
just has to shut up and watch.

40
00:01:50,927 --> 00:01:52,327
I hope I get a good OR.

41
00:01:52,396 --> 00:01:53,840
Is it up yet? Not yet.

42
00:01:53,864 --> 00:01:55,041
Hey, you heard about Zola?

43
00:01:55,065 --> 00:01:56,130
I haven't heard anything.

44
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:57,799
And she's clipping
her first aneurysm.

45
00:01:57,868 --> 00:01:59,679
Are you sure you don't want
to start with something simpler?

46
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:01,280
Yeah, like juggling chain saws?

47
00:02:01,304 --> 00:02:02,854
Thanks. That's helping.

48
00:02:02,923 --> 00:02:04,567
Hey, is it up yet? Is it up yet?

49
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:05,958
It's going up now.

50
00:02:06,026 --> 00:02:07,737
Hey, you heard anything?
Haven't heard anything.

51
00:02:07,761 --> 00:02:09,328
How are you even here?

52
00:02:09,396 --> 00:02:11,308
Well, there's nothing I can
do, and I have to do something,

53
00:02:11,332 --> 00:02:12,664
so I might as well do this.

54
00:02:12,732 --> 00:02:14,532
It's up. It's up.

55
00:02:16,736 --> 00:02:18,820
OR 3. Yes!

56
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:20,555
I love OR 3.

57
00:02:22,393 --> 00:02:24,303
Bowel resection? I thought
you had a Peds case.

58
00:02:24,327 --> 00:02:25,560
I switched last minute.

59
00:02:25,629 --> 00:02:27,963
You can't just switch.

60
00:02:28,031 --> 00:02:30,081
Plastics. I thought
you were the Gunther.

61
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,661
Wasting all your
capital on boob jobs?

62
00:02:31,685 --> 00:02:34,564
It's a cleft lip. I'm
changing a kid's life today.

63
00:02:34,588 --> 00:02:36,454
Look at Kepner, she's
fixing a bum knee.

64
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:37,717
Way to shoot for the stars, kid.

65
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:40,458
Okay, guys. You also start
teaching skills labs today.

66
00:02:40,527 --> 00:02:41,967
I made up a schedule
for the month.

67
00:02:42,012 --> 00:02:43,412
It's up on the
board in my office.

68
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:46,532
In your what?

69
00:02:51,121 --> 00:02:52,487
When did we get this?

70
00:02:52,556 --> 00:02:54,906
We didn't. It's for the
chief resident, actually.

71
00:02:54,975 --> 00:02:57,092
This is good. I
can sleep on this.

72
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:00,039
Yeah, I got that on
Craigslist. It's mine.

73
00:03:00,063 --> 00:03:01,096
We got a fridge?

74
00:03:04,034 --> 00:03:05,979
Okay, guys. Why
is my name on this?

75
00:03:06,003 --> 00:03:08,370
These are this month's
intern skills labs.

76
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:10,317
Each of you has been
given one skills lab to teach.

77
00:03:10,341 --> 00:03:12,340
No, I can't teach today.
I'm on a mitral valve.

78
00:03:12,409 --> 00:03:14,687
Okay, well, then just switch
with one of these guys.

79
00:03:14,711 --> 00:03:16,406
Aneurysm. I got a baby's face.

80
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:18,714
Guys, come on. I
divided these up fairly.

81
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:21,061
You come on. Every
surgery we do this year

82
00:03:21,085 --> 00:03:22,495
could end up on the oral boards.

83
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:24,130
And they love picking
the crappy outcomes.

84
00:03:24,154 --> 00:03:26,321
This could affect
which fellowship I get.

85
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:29,090
I mean, it's not just
life or death, April.

86
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:30,653
Now it's our careers.

87
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:32,805
Okay, how's this? Whoever
has the worst outcome today

88
00:03:32,829 --> 00:03:34,808
teaches all the skills
labs for the whole month.

89
00:03:34,832 --> 00:03:36,176
That's good. I'm in.

90
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,200
That's terrible.

91
00:03:37,267 --> 00:03:38,311
You guys get this e-mail?

92
00:03:38,335 --> 00:03:39,495
You know, that's disgusting.

93
00:03:39,536 --> 00:03:41,937
No, no, no. There
will be no wagering

94
00:03:42,005 --> 00:03:44,389
on patient outcomes.
That's an order.

95
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:45,673
So you're out, then?

96
00:03:45,742 --> 00:03:47,203
You know, okay, just...
Everyone out of my office.

97
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,427
Whoa! Webber resigned.

98
00:03:49,679 --> 00:03:53,181
He's no longer Chief of Surgery.

99
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,833
Dr. Owen Hunt is
now Chief of Surgery.

100
00:03:58,589 --> 00:03:59,688
What?

101
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:11,666
That the Alzheimer's
trial? Heard from the FDA?

102
00:04:11,735 --> 00:04:13,134
I'm sending it to Phoenix.

103
00:04:13,203 --> 00:04:15,787
Carl Baumann is taking
over. I'm blacklisted.

104
00:04:15,856 --> 00:04:18,101
I may never do another
clinical trial ever again.

105
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:19,485
Yeah, I've been
blacklisted, too.

106
00:04:20,778 --> 00:04:23,178
And now you're
gonna let them fire you?

107
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:25,714
I fired myself.

108
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:27,727
It's one thing, taking
the blame for Meredith

109
00:04:27,751 --> 00:04:29,367
and losing the trial, but

110
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:31,064
why are you doing
this to yourself?

111
00:04:31,088 --> 00:04:32,232
You know, I came
to ask if you heard

112
00:04:32,256 --> 00:04:33,976
anything about your little girl.

113
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:36,274
No, I have not.

114
00:04:37,677 --> 00:04:38,917
This isn't right.

115
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:41,129
Hope you hear soon.

116
00:04:44,468 --> 00:04:46,368
How does he not tell
me he's Chief of Surgery?

117
00:04:46,437 --> 00:04:47,802
Well, is it because you...

118
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:49,604
Didn't have his baby?

119
00:04:49,673 --> 00:04:50,883
I mean, has he said anything?

120
00:04:50,907 --> 00:04:54,025
No. We haven't talked about it.

121
00:04:54,094 --> 00:04:55,534
At all? Is that bad?

122
00:04:55,562 --> 00:04:56,906
That's bad, right?
Well, I mean, it's just...

123
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:58,447
Oh, hey. Oh, hey.

124
00:04:58,515 --> 00:05:00,098
Is it true?

125
00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:01,599
Uh, yeah.

126
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:03,085
Oh, my God. When did...

127
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:05,454
Well, Webber talked
to me last night, but...

128
00:05:05,522 --> 00:05:07,033
I was gonna tell you, but
you were already asleep,

129
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:08,501
and then this morning,
you had already gone...

130
00:05:08,525 --> 00:05:10,175
Yeah. My mitral valve.

131
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:13,311
Right. Right. Right, sorry.

132
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,796
Sorry. Good luck.

133
00:05:14,865 --> 00:05:19,367
No! No. Oh, God,
you... You, you're the...

134
00:05:19,436 --> 00:05:21,263
Uh, this is great.
We should celebrate.

135
00:05:21,287 --> 00:05:25,156
I guess so, yeah. Um... Dinner?

136
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:27,442
My surgery.

137
00:05:27,511 --> 00:05:29,991
Mitral valve takes, like, a
minimum of seven hours.

138
00:05:30,597 --> 00:05:32,480
Sometime. Okay?

139
00:05:32,548 --> 00:05:34,566
I gotta... Congratulations.

140
00:05:34,618 --> 00:05:36,100
Thanks. Yeah.

141
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,603
Congratulations.

142
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,440
Yeah, that was bad.

143
00:05:45,528 --> 00:05:48,540
Hey. I need an intern to
assist on my bowel resection.

144
00:05:48,564 --> 00:05:51,249
Well, everyone's booked,
so good luck finding someone.

145
00:05:51,318 --> 00:05:52,700
Isn't that your job?

146
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:55,699
No, my job is making the
schedule that you screwed up.

147
00:05:55,723 --> 00:05:57,322
Ah, Karev.

148
00:05:57,391 --> 00:05:58,956
I just saw that you turned down

149
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:01,977
my three-month-old's esophageal
atresia surgery for Webber's...

150
00:06:06,567 --> 00:06:08,884
I'm so sorry.

151
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:10,986
I was trying to say
Webber's bowel resection,

152
00:06:11,054 --> 00:06:12,837
but then I fell asleep.

153
00:06:12,906 --> 00:06:14,767
I just thought I could use more
practice with bowel resections.

154
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,108
No, you're trying to pad your
boards with good outcomes,

155
00:06:17,176 --> 00:06:18,805
so you went for the
easy A. You keep that up,

156
00:06:18,829 --> 00:06:21,110
and you're gonna lowball
yourself out of the fellowship.

157
00:06:22,598 --> 00:06:23,932
Is that what you're doing?

158
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,795
Or is this about
winning that stupid bet?

159
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:27,352
Just find me an intern.

160
00:06:27,421 --> 00:06:29,332
Karev, you ready
for your surgery?

161
00:06:29,356 --> 00:06:30,755
Uh, I think so, sir.

162
00:06:30,824 --> 00:06:32,868
Kepner's having a little
trouble getting it staffed.

163
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:34,971
What's the problem? I've been
treating Sam Kenton for years.

164
00:06:34,995 --> 00:06:36,155
I don't want to have
to postpone him.

165
00:06:36,179 --> 00:06:38,357
No, sir. No, sir. I will
find someone to assist.

166
00:06:38,381 --> 00:06:40,844
I'll get it covered, even
if I have to do it myself.

167
00:06:40,868 --> 00:06:42,434
Well, great.

168
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,118
Great.

169
00:06:46,456 --> 00:06:49,184
So if Rob's out of surgery,
then I'll pick him up from school,

170
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:50,553
but if not, then I'll text you,

171
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:52,121
and you can drop him at Kathy's.

172
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:54,712
Yeah, thanks so much. Okay, bye.

173
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:56,314
Sorry, I just...

174
00:06:56,382 --> 00:06:57,610
Have to make sure we
got the kids squared away.

175
00:06:57,634 --> 00:06:58,917
I totally understand.

176
00:06:58,985 --> 00:07:00,084
You have kids?

177
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:01,702
Let's get back to your surgery.

178
00:07:01,771 --> 00:07:03,704
So I will locate the aneurysm,

179
00:07:03,773 --> 00:07:06,407
which is the bulge in
the wall of your artery.

180
00:07:06,476 --> 00:07:08,159
And then I will
take a steel clip,

181
00:07:08,228 --> 00:07:09,860
which is like a tiny clothespin,

182
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:12,714
and I'm gonna place it across
the neck of the aneurysm.

183
00:07:12,782 --> 00:07:14,449
And that will stop
the blood supply.

184
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:16,095
That way, we don't have
to worry about a rupture.

185
00:07:16,119 --> 00:07:17,297
How do you know if you fixed it?

186
00:07:17,321 --> 00:07:19,337
Well, we do what we
call a matador move.

187
00:07:19,406 --> 00:07:23,074
I'll take a needle, and I poke
the dome of the aneurysm.

188
00:07:23,143 --> 00:07:24,709
And if we see a
tiny amount of blood,

189
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:26,077
then we know it was successful.

190
00:07:26,146 --> 00:07:28,746
And if it wasn't
successful, it bursts.

191
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,281
Possibly.

192
00:07:31,134 --> 00:07:32,500
And I die.

193
00:07:32,568 --> 00:07:34,002
Not if I get it clipped.

194
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:37,355
And what's your success
rate? How many have you done?

195
00:07:40,544 --> 00:07:42,510
This will be my first.

196
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:50,001
I sort of wish you
lied about that.

197
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:53,271
Yeah, well, after today, her
success rate will be 100%.

198
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,801
Dr. Grey is the best we have,
and I'll be there the whole time.

199
00:07:55,825 --> 00:07:57,542
Do you have any other questions?

200
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:59,944
No. No, thanks.

201
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:01,429
Try and rest easy.

202
00:08:02,566 --> 00:08:04,182
I'll see you after.

203
00:08:04,251 --> 00:08:06,284
Yeah. Okay. Thank you.

204
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:09,265
Thank you for that.

205
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:10,321
Yeah.

206
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:13,035
Have you heard anything
from the social worker?

207
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:14,192
No. Have you?

208
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,376
No.

209
00:08:15,445 --> 00:08:17,123
I'm worried. If we haven't
heard back by now,

210
00:08:17,147 --> 00:08:18,457
that it's not gonna go our
way. Well, I'll call again.

211
00:08:18,481 --> 00:08:20,715
No, don't. We've
called too much.

212
00:08:20,784 --> 00:08:21,999
Derek.

213
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:23,384
Yes.

214
00:08:23,453 --> 00:08:24,847
What if we don't get Zola back?

215
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:26,387
I mean, what happens to us?

216
00:08:26,456 --> 00:08:28,823
What do you want to do?
Do you want to stay together?

217
00:08:28,892 --> 00:08:31,259
We have a surgery.

218
00:08:31,328 --> 00:08:32,727
Let's just focus on that.

219
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:53,765
You.

220
00:08:53,834 --> 00:08:56,067
Ruth Bennet, 50,
mitral valve replacement,

221
00:08:56,135 --> 00:08:57,780
patient complained
overnight of stomach pains.

222
00:08:57,804 --> 00:08:59,465
These stomach
pains, what did you do?

223
00:08:59,489 --> 00:09:00,921
You.

224
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:02,335
We tested her cardiac
enzymes, ran an echo.

225
00:09:02,359 --> 00:09:03,390
Both were normal.

226
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:05,619
Did anyone touch her stomach?

227
00:09:14,621 --> 00:09:16,633
No one touched the patient?
Are you guys the slow class?

228
00:09:16,657 --> 00:09:20,674
Palpating the patient's abdomen
is first, before tests or labs.

229
00:09:20,743 --> 00:09:22,444
Basics, people. Fundamentals.

230
00:09:22,512 --> 00:09:24,462
I'm all about not
skipping steps.

231
00:09:26,165 --> 00:09:27,648
Ow!

232
00:09:27,717 --> 00:09:28,999
Oh, sorry.

233
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:30,746
Does it hurt more or less
when I take my hand away?

234
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:32,186
More.

235
00:09:32,255 --> 00:09:35,506
See? Basics. You should
be doing this in your sleep.

236
00:09:35,558 --> 00:09:38,443
Take Mrs. Bennet
for a triple-contrast CT.

237
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:41,713
Try not to get lost.

238
00:09:44,734 --> 00:09:48,369
He just seems so little.
I thought it could wait.

239
00:09:48,438 --> 00:09:51,656
I understand, but I assure
you that now is the right time.

240
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:54,826
By fixing those muscles early,

241
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:56,995
his maxilla, his
whole upper jaw,

242
00:09:57,064 --> 00:09:59,114
will have a real shot
at forming properly.

243
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:02,000
But he'll have a scar?

244
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:04,213
Well, I'm gonna do what's
called a straight-line repair.

245
00:10:04,237 --> 00:10:06,004
So that'll leave a little scar,

246
00:10:06,056 --> 00:10:08,923
which I'll hide right in the
contour of his lip right here.

247
00:10:08,991 --> 00:10:11,993
And then over time,
it'll fade altogether.

248
00:10:12,061 --> 00:10:13,711
Shouldn't even be noticeable.

249
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,124
Then he'll look
even more handsome

250
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:17,031
than he does right
now, if that's possible.

251
00:10:18,018 --> 00:10:20,138
He is a pretty
handsome guy, isn't he?

252
00:10:20,187 --> 00:10:22,954
He certainly is. Yes, you are.

253
00:10:23,023 --> 00:10:25,756
You want to wait here with your
mama while I go get you all set up?

254
00:10:25,826 --> 00:10:27,558
Yeah?

255
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,254
I'll come back this
afternoon, all right, buddy?

256
00:10:29,278 --> 00:10:30,761
Thank you, Dr. Avery.

257
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:33,948
My pleasure. He'll do great.

258
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:38,253
Excellent.

259
00:10:38,288 --> 00:10:39,332
You couldn't have been clearer,

260
00:10:39,356 --> 00:10:40,400
you answered her questions.

261
00:10:40,424 --> 00:10:42,457
You eased her fears.
Thanks. That's...

262
00:10:42,526 --> 00:10:44,246
Mark Sloan's gonna
do the surgery, though.

263
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:47,946
How's that? It's not you.

264
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:49,408
You're great.
You're the Gunther.

265
00:10:49,432 --> 00:10:50,876
But you're planning
a straight-line repair,

266
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,461
and I'd rather the kid
get a Millard rotation

267
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,547
so that we don't risk the
lip shortening over time.

268
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:56,015
But I was actually...
For the kid's sake,

269
00:10:56,039 --> 00:10:58,690
I gotta have Sloan
do it. He's an artist.

270
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:00,925
Dr. Robbins,

271
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:02,234
it's my procedure.

272
00:11:02,295 --> 00:11:05,012
I'm sorry, Avery.
Just not this time.

273
00:11:09,202 --> 00:11:10,852
This is Sam Kenton, 55.

274
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,386
He's here for a bowel resection

275
00:11:12,455 --> 00:11:14,622
due to chronic
mesenteric ischemia.

276
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:17,024
This is Sam's third
surgery with us.

277
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:18,333
Third time's the charm.

278
00:11:18,361 --> 00:11:20,139
And this is Sam's son, Jason.

279
00:11:20,163 --> 00:11:23,581
Jason should be in school
instead of here, playing nursemaid.

280
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:25,778
It's one semester. Think how
much money I'm saving you.

281
00:11:25,802 --> 00:11:27,713
Well, I'm worried, you're
not getting any smarter.

282
00:11:27,737 --> 00:11:29,604
Kid's not very smart.

283
00:11:29,673 --> 00:11:31,956
Wonder where I get that from.

284
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:33,235
Did he just call me stupid?

285
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:34,509
I think he did.

286
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:36,922
Sam's been Dr. Webber's
patient since...

287
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:39,146
Kepner, just give
me the bullet, okay?

288
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:48,156
Sam Kenton, 55, presents with
chronic mesenteric ischemia.

289
00:11:48,225 --> 00:11:50,391
Nonresponsive to
revascularization.

290
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,860
Scheduled for an
exploratory laparotomy

291
00:11:52,929 --> 00:11:55,630
and possible bowel resection.

292
00:11:57,934 --> 00:11:59,662
Oh, it's so sad. I mean, how
many years was he chief for?

293
00:11:59,686 --> 00:12:00,751
Eleven.

294
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,231
I mean, are we
supposed to all pretend

295
00:12:02,255 --> 00:12:03,599
we don't know what
really happened?

296
00:12:03,623 --> 00:12:04,767
Oh, why did he cover for her?

297
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:06,151
I mean, what's
his deal with her?

298
00:12:06,943 --> 00:12:08,159
Hey. Hi.

299
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:09,710
Good morning, ladies.

300
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,446
Uh, uh, so what's
the system here?

301
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:18,097
Does everybody have a spot or...

302
00:12:18,121 --> 00:12:19,361
Anywhere is fine.

303
00:12:19,422 --> 00:12:20,955
Oh. All right, then.

304
00:12:21,024 --> 00:12:23,557
Right... Here.

305
00:12:23,626 --> 00:12:25,986
And I will see
you this afternoon.

306
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:28,858
You all have an excellent day.

307
00:12:28,882 --> 00:12:30,865
You, too. Already am.

308
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,498
I mean, he's trying so hard.

309
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:37,762
He talked to his sandwich.

310
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,077
Well, what are...

311
00:12:43,146 --> 00:12:44,946
Doctor... Sorry. Chief.

312
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:46,525
Larry Jennings sent
you this bottle of scotch

313
00:12:46,549 --> 00:12:47,626
to say congratulations.

314
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:49,328
Thanks. Just put it somewhere.

315
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:51,197
Okay. And, Dr. Torres,
I need to push

316
00:12:51,221 --> 00:12:52,464
my meniscus repair to tomorrow.

317
00:12:52,488 --> 00:12:54,366
I have to teach a skills lab.

318
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:55,689
A skills lab over a surgery?

319
00:12:55,758 --> 00:12:58,103
Yeah, and then I have to assist
Karev on a bowel resection.

320
00:12:58,127 --> 00:12:59,438
You should be
delegating that stuff.

321
00:12:59,462 --> 00:13:01,273
I tried, but no
one would cover it.

322
00:13:01,297 --> 00:13:03,242
Don't try, Kepner.
Just order them.

323
00:13:03,266 --> 00:13:05,444
Leadership isn't
about making friends.

324
00:13:05,468 --> 00:13:08,402
Well, then I'm doing it right.

325
00:13:08,471 --> 00:13:10,911
That was nice.
Very chief-y. Mmm.

326
00:13:11,107 --> 00:13:12,406
Dr. Hunt.

327
00:13:12,475 --> 00:13:14,275
May I have my call
schedule, please?

328
00:13:14,343 --> 00:13:15,827
Sorry? My call schedule,

329
00:13:15,895 --> 00:13:18,040
which I usually get at the
staff meeting, but I didn't,

330
00:13:18,064 --> 00:13:19,808
because you said you
would distribute them,

331
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:22,133
but you haven't, so I
had to come find you,

332
00:13:22,202 --> 00:13:25,336
and you're not very easy to
find, not unlike my call schedule.

333
00:13:25,404 --> 00:13:27,555
So may I have my
call schedule, please?

334
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:30,135
Of course. Just as soon as...

335
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:31,325
Thank you.

336
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,841
That was way less chief-y there.

337
00:13:35,865 --> 00:13:37,432
Okay. What did I do?

338
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,345
Nothing. Nothing. She was
Webber's right-hand man.

339
00:13:39,369 --> 00:13:41,689
She'd hate anyone
in your position.

340
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:44,800
Yeah, I know it's not
about making friends,

341
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:47,691
but you really want
Bailey as your enemy?

342
00:13:54,384 --> 00:13:56,884
I was right. Ruth Bennet's
scans show appendicitis.

343
00:13:56,952 --> 00:13:58,736
The morons missed
it. I'm turfing her to

344
00:13:58,805 --> 00:14:01,206
general surgery for
an appendectomy.

345
00:14:01,274 --> 00:14:02,514
Why don't you do the appy?

346
00:14:04,227 --> 00:14:05,493
Where do I start?

347
00:14:05,562 --> 00:14:08,079
Because it's general
surgery, and I'm on cardio.

348
00:14:08,148 --> 00:14:10,498
Because it's first-year
surgery, and I'm a fifth year.

349
00:14:10,567 --> 00:14:12,110
Because... You know
what? This is great.

350
00:14:12,134 --> 00:14:13,312
I mean, Ruth has
a heart condition,

351
00:14:13,336 --> 00:14:15,213
and we have to
monitor her anyway.

352
00:14:15,237 --> 00:14:17,416
And because of her COPD,
she has to have an open appy,

353
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,841
and we don't want
some moron doing it.

354
00:14:19,909 --> 00:14:21,976
And you get a procedure.

355
00:14:22,045 --> 00:14:24,012
It's a very basic procedure.

356
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:27,514
But you love the basics. And
you're all about the fundamentals.

357
00:14:32,739 --> 00:14:36,374
Can I ask you something,
just about his recovery,

358
00:14:36,443 --> 00:14:39,410
specifically the,
like, bathroom part?

359
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,244
Will I need to be
in there with him?

360
00:14:46,268 --> 00:14:48,614
'Cause my mom was here
for his other surgeries, and...

361
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:49,970
Right.

362
00:14:50,039 --> 00:14:52,701
I'll do it. I'll totally do
whatever he needs.

363
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:54,925
I just want to be prepared,
you know, 'cause...

364
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:57,028
He'll be embarrassed and I'll...

365
00:14:58,447 --> 00:14:59,925
Well, neither of
us is gonna like it.

366
00:14:59,949 --> 00:15:03,384
Yeah, there are a couple
of possible outcomes.

367
00:15:03,453 --> 00:15:05,453
And it all just sort of depends

368
00:15:05,522 --> 00:15:07,522
on what Dr. Karev
finds during surgery.

369
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:11,776
So I'll have him come and
talk you through them, okay?

370
00:15:11,845 --> 00:15:15,362
Is that guy cool? He
seems a little... Douchey.

371
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,150
He's good, very good.

372
00:15:19,219 --> 00:15:22,637
He can be a little douchey...

373
00:15:22,705 --> 00:15:25,773
But he's a good guy,
and a very good surgeon.

374
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:29,143
Thanks.

375
00:15:36,552 --> 00:15:38,052
Meredith, uh...

376
00:15:39,055 --> 00:15:41,306
Oh, I'm sorry.

377
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:45,154
I'm sorry. I never
meant for any of this to...

378
00:15:45,178 --> 00:15:46,538
I know what you
wanted to do for me.

379
00:15:46,562 --> 00:15:47,756
But... I do.

380
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,181
I saw you were clipping
your first aneurysm,

381
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:51,549
wanted to say good luck.

382
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:55,320
I am trying to figure
out what clip to use.

383
00:15:55,388 --> 00:15:57,288
Well, you can't,

384
00:15:57,357 --> 00:15:58,889
not until you see it.

385
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,891
Yeah.

386
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,761
Every aneurysm is
different, a different approach.

387
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:07,347
You'll know what to do
once you get in there.

388
00:16:08,584 --> 00:16:09,700
It's a big deal.

389
00:16:09,752 --> 00:16:11,702
A resident's first
aneurysm clip.

390
00:16:11,755 --> 00:16:14,922
Derek leads the whole
OR in a round of applause.

391
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:16,607
I...

392
00:16:16,676 --> 00:16:19,077
Don't know that he'll
do that today, but...

393
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:23,864
You two all right?

394
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:27,802
I, uh, only ask

395
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:30,571
because if you can't
communicate with your attending,

396
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:33,307
you have no business
being in that OR,

397
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:35,726
no matter how prepared you are.

398
00:16:35,795 --> 00:16:37,795
We're okay. We're fine.

399
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:43,668
All right.

400
00:16:58,685 --> 00:16:59,917
I need your pig.

401
00:16:59,986 --> 00:17:01,497
I have to remember how to
do an open appendectomy.

402
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:04,522
No. Does a pig even
have an appendix?

403
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:06,101
Let's find out. Who
wants an aneurysm?

404
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:07,936
I'm about to have one.
I have to do an appy.

405
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,400
On a pig? Does a
pig even have one?

406
00:17:09,446 --> 00:17:11,929
On a person. I haven't
thought about one in...

407
00:17:11,997 --> 00:17:13,664
Three years. Well, come on.

408
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:15,415
Who wants to
trade? I'll do anything.

409
00:17:15,484 --> 00:17:17,751
Clipping those things
is like defusing a bomb.

410
00:17:17,821 --> 00:17:19,164
One wrong move, and it explodes.

411
00:17:19,188 --> 00:17:21,288
Well, I'm worried
about Derek exploding.

412
00:17:21,357 --> 00:17:22,751
Can I have your pig? ALEX: No.

413
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:24,453
How about just the head, huh?

414
00:17:24,477 --> 00:17:26,110
Want to clip an aneurysm?

415
00:17:26,179 --> 00:17:27,622
Good luck, MacGyver.

416
00:17:27,646 --> 00:17:28,946
There you are. Alex...

417
00:17:29,015 --> 00:17:30,981
Does a pig have an appendix?

418
00:17:31,051 --> 00:17:32,051
I don't know.

419
00:17:32,101 --> 00:17:33,829
I thought you were
teaching my skills lab.

420
00:17:33,853 --> 00:17:35,781
I am. I just left them to
practice whipstitches. Alex...

421
00:17:35,805 --> 00:17:38,056
Stop. Turn out the
lights. Close the door.

422
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:44,662
Check this out.

423
00:17:46,015 --> 00:17:47,798
Injected fluorescein dye,

424
00:17:47,867 --> 00:17:49,750
it makes any viable
part of the bowel glow.

425
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:51,413
Nice. Yeah, in high school,

426
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:52,865
I had a Metallica
poster just like this.

427
00:17:52,889 --> 00:17:54,055
You might win the bet.

428
00:17:54,123 --> 00:17:55,300
Yeah, with a color-coded colon.

429
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:56,724
No kidding.

430
00:17:58,645 --> 00:18:00,161
I have a bomb to defuse.

431
00:18:00,229 --> 00:18:03,309
This is crazy. I gotta
find a book or a skills...

432
00:18:03,365 --> 00:18:05,249
Oh, skills lab.

433
00:18:05,318 --> 00:18:07,245
I gotta get some instruments. I'm
just gonna use the head, all right?

434
00:18:07,269 --> 00:18:08,898
Will you talk to Jason Kenton?
He has some questions...

435
00:18:08,922 --> 00:18:10,900
I'm busy. Turning a
pig into a lava lamp?

436
00:18:10,924 --> 00:18:13,284
My patient... It's not
my job. You talk to him.

437
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:19,179
Show of hands, who knows the
steps of an open appendectomy?

438
00:18:22,735 --> 00:18:26,095
Dr. Bailey, your call
schedule. Sorry it was so...

439
00:18:26,705 --> 00:18:28,139
Uh-huh.

440
00:18:28,207 --> 00:18:29,818
So, Bailey, I know
you've taken over

441
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:32,020
Dr. Webber's islet cell trial.

442
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:35,429
And I wanted to offer you some
protected time for your research.

443
00:18:35,498 --> 00:18:37,008
I can reduce your OR schedule,

444
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:38,272
lighten your teaching load,

445
00:18:38,334 --> 00:18:41,051
make sure you get
that time that you need.

446
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,753
How does that sound?

447
00:18:42,822 --> 00:18:45,067
You telling me I don't
manage my time well?

448
00:18:45,091 --> 00:18:46,690
No. No. No, no, no.

449
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:49,794
I just wanted to make sure
that your research got the time...

450
00:18:49,863 --> 00:18:51,679
Oh, you're telling me
how to use my time?

451
00:18:51,748 --> 00:18:54,843
Not at all. I wouldn't. I'm
sorry. Just forget I mentioned it.

452
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:56,684
Now I don't get the time?

453
00:18:56,752 --> 00:18:59,712
No, you do. You do. You
can... You can, just do what...

454
00:19:05,828 --> 00:19:10,163
No, leave it up. Leave it up. I'll
just do the meniscus repair myself.

455
00:19:10,233 --> 00:19:13,567
Great. And now I
lose a procedure.

456
00:19:13,636 --> 00:19:15,185
This is worse than
being an intern.

457
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:18,283
Yeah, being chief
resident sucks. I did it once.

458
00:19:18,307 --> 00:19:21,141
Well, how'd you do it? How'd
you get them to listen to you?

459
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:23,210
I didn't. I sucked.

460
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:24,919
Oh.

461
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,232
Look, it's...

462
00:19:28,301 --> 00:19:29,878
It's not about making friends,

463
00:19:29,902 --> 00:19:31,547
but it is about getting
them on your side.

464
00:19:31,571 --> 00:19:34,633
You want to be the person they
come to, not the one they run from.

465
00:19:34,657 --> 00:19:36,401
You know, kinda
like your little contest.

466
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:38,659
You know, getting them to
compete for good outcomes.

467
00:19:38,728 --> 00:19:40,160
I know. It's awful, right?

468
00:19:40,229 --> 00:19:42,607
No, that was a good idea.
They thrive on competition.

469
00:19:42,631 --> 00:19:44,560
You gave them what they needed.

470
00:19:44,584 --> 00:19:45,744
And either way,
the patient wins.

471
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:48,419
That was a good idea.

472
00:19:48,488 --> 00:19:50,187
Okay.

473
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:53,218
That wasn't your idea, was it?

474
00:19:53,242 --> 00:19:54,608
No.

475
00:19:54,677 --> 00:19:57,611
Well... Don't give
up. You'll be great.

476
00:19:58,497 --> 00:20:01,332
Or maybe you won't. I never was.

477
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:07,204
It's perfect.

478
00:20:07,273 --> 00:20:10,040
It's a perfect Millard rotation.

479
00:20:10,476 --> 00:20:12,042
On a pig.

480
00:20:12,111 --> 00:20:15,946
This pig is now more
attractive than your average pig.

481
00:20:16,014 --> 00:20:17,848
I deserve to do it.

482
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:20,876
I'm ready. I can
do it. I deserve it.

483
00:20:22,822 --> 00:20:24,755
You're right.

484
00:20:24,824 --> 00:20:26,006
You go, Gunther.

485
00:20:28,044 --> 00:20:30,660
Next step? You.

486
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:34,114
Lift up peritoneum, open
transversely, and enlarge the incision.

487
00:20:34,183 --> 00:20:35,183
Enlarge how?

488
00:20:37,237 --> 00:20:39,557
With scissors? Are you
asking me or telling me?

489
00:20:40,022 --> 00:20:41,072
With scissors.

490
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,506
Okay. Okay, good.

491
00:20:43,443 --> 00:20:46,109
Then what? You.

492
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:48,307
Pull out and isolate the
appendix. Mmm-hmm.

493
00:20:48,331 --> 00:20:50,998
Cross-clamp it
at the base, and...

494
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:53,450
And go on.

495
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:57,071
I can't remember.

496
00:20:57,140 --> 00:21:00,307
Unacceptable. God.
You should know this.

497
00:21:00,376 --> 00:21:02,170
Cross-clamp the
appendix at the base...

498
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:04,556
Yeah, you already did that.
Okay? Hurry up. He's dying now.

499
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:07,364
Tie off or... Wait. Ligate...

500
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:08,982
Hurry. You're losing him. Beep.

501
00:21:09,051 --> 00:21:10,734
Beep. Beep. Wait. Hang on.

502
00:21:10,803 --> 00:21:12,147
Beep. Wait.

503
00:21:12,171 --> 00:21:13,731
Wait. Beep.

504
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:16,924
Call the morgue,
moron. He's dead.

505
00:21:17,926 --> 00:21:19,010
Okay, who's next?

506
00:21:21,314 --> 00:21:22,314
You.

507
00:21:27,353 --> 00:21:29,903
Open transversely,
enlarge with scissors,

508
00:21:29,972 --> 00:21:32,839
insert retractors,
deliver appendix,

509
00:21:32,908 --> 00:21:34,775
cross-clamp at the base.

510
00:21:34,843 --> 00:21:37,110
Hey, so... You going
in for your mitral valve?

511
00:21:37,179 --> 00:21:39,190
My mitral valve
turned into an appy.

512
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:43,200
Oh, right. Well, good luck.

513
00:21:43,252 --> 00:21:45,786
So, does that mean
you'll be home tonight?

514
00:21:45,855 --> 00:21:50,524
I mean, an appy's what,
two hours, tops, right?

515
00:21:50,593 --> 00:21:52,459
Right. That is true.

516
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,974
Oh, do you want me
to pick something up?

517
00:21:55,998 --> 00:21:57,765
Or I can. Chinese?

518
00:21:57,833 --> 00:21:59,450
Oh, fine. Whatever.

519
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:00,713
No, no, you choose.

520
00:22:00,737 --> 00:22:02,264
Do Chinese. Chinese is great.

521
00:22:02,288 --> 00:22:05,606
Good. Right. Well, good luck.

522
00:22:05,674 --> 00:22:07,641
And you, too, Grey.

523
00:22:10,446 --> 00:22:11,873
You have to talk
about it because clearly,

524
00:22:11,897 --> 00:22:13,142
you can't talk about anything.

525
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:14,293
You two are like bad roommates.

526
00:22:14,317 --> 00:22:16,083
How? How do I bring it up?

527
00:22:16,151 --> 00:22:18,263
I mean, does he even
want me to bring it up?

528
00:22:18,287 --> 00:22:20,732
And what is there to talk
about? 'Cause it's done.

529
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:22,756
I can't undo it. It's done.

530
00:22:22,825 --> 00:22:23,940
Yeah, but it's not.

531
00:22:26,028 --> 00:22:27,428
We have surgery.

532
00:22:27,497 --> 00:22:29,417
Don't screw it up. You, too.

533
00:22:32,919 --> 00:22:34,496
Did you know Sam's
wife took care of him

534
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,298
after his last two surgeries?

535
00:22:36,322 --> 00:22:37,733
She died of a stroke last year,

536
00:22:37,757 --> 00:22:39,723
so Jason dropped out of college

537
00:22:39,792 --> 00:22:41,236
one semester before graduating.

538
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:42,937
He was happy to do it
'cause... What the hell, Kepner?

539
00:22:42,961 --> 00:22:44,261
Why are you telling me this?

540
00:22:44,329 --> 00:22:46,964
Talking to patients
is your job, Alex,

541
00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:49,633
because they're
more than just...

542
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:52,603
An easy A or some
bet you can win.

543
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:53,715
It's your job.

544
00:22:53,739 --> 00:22:54,816
No, it's not. Not anymore.

545
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,573
My job is to open
him up and fix him,

546
00:22:56,642 --> 00:22:58,775
and if I can't do it, no
one's gonna do it for me.

547
00:22:58,844 --> 00:23:01,328
It's on me. So I can
spend time talking to him

548
00:23:01,397 --> 00:23:03,508
or I can use that time
figuring out what I'm gonna do

549
00:23:03,532 --> 00:23:06,133
when I open him up. Which
one do you want me to do?

550
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:15,342
You're really nervous.

551
00:23:17,463 --> 00:23:19,930
That's why you didn't
want to work on a kid today.

552
00:23:19,999 --> 00:23:21,865
Look, you'll be fine.

553
00:23:23,135 --> 00:23:24,267
You're ready.

554
00:23:24,336 --> 00:23:26,216
I mean, you feel ready, right?

555
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:34,078
I am thoroughly
enjoying this book, Karev.

556
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:35,479
That's great.

557
00:23:35,531 --> 00:23:37,664
Hopefully, I'll
finish it in there,

558
00:23:37,733 --> 00:23:39,700
because as long as I'm reading,

559
00:23:39,768 --> 00:23:41,702
it means that you're
not screwing up.

560
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:43,620
Will I finish this book today?

561
00:23:43,689 --> 00:23:45,589
Yes, sir. All right.

562
00:23:54,283 --> 00:23:55,928
Have you got the pre-op scans?

563
00:23:55,952 --> 00:23:58,713
I already looked them
over. I want to look again.

564
00:23:59,322 --> 00:24:00,899
I think you should
do the surgery.

565
00:24:00,923 --> 00:24:02,189
Why?

566
00:24:02,258 --> 00:24:03,858
Because we're not
a team right now.

567
00:24:06,311 --> 00:24:08,256
What happens if the
aneurysm ruptures?

568
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,825
Put a temporary clip
on the feeding artery.

569
00:24:09,849 --> 00:24:11,276
And if the aneurysm
still bleeds?

570
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,977
I gain control of the
common carotid in the neck.

571
00:24:13,001 --> 00:24:14,212
What kind of clip are
you gonna go with?

572
00:24:14,236 --> 00:24:15,596
I won't know
till I get in there.

573
00:24:17,189 --> 00:24:18,605
You're ready. Let's go.

574
00:24:35,074 --> 00:24:36,673
What are you doing?

575
00:24:36,742 --> 00:24:39,793
You're the lead surgeon.
You're on that side.

576
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:43,297
Yeah.

577
00:24:49,305 --> 00:24:52,189
You practiced it the
other way, didn't you?

578
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,493
Is there a problem?

579
00:24:56,562 --> 00:24:58,729
No, sir. 10-Blade.

580
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:04,868
What are you doing now?

581
00:25:04,937 --> 00:25:06,136
Are we still doing the thing

582
00:25:06,205 --> 00:25:07,766
where I have to tell
you every little move...

583
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:09,030
Never gets old.

584
00:25:11,077 --> 00:25:13,543
What are you doing now?

585
00:25:13,612 --> 00:25:16,329
Blunt separation of
the oblique muscles.

586
00:25:16,398 --> 00:25:17,581
Neat.

587
00:25:24,973 --> 00:25:26,573
You know, you have a kid

588
00:25:26,642 --> 00:25:29,809
and you worry a lot
about screwing 'em up.

589
00:25:29,878 --> 00:25:32,179
Like something
that you do or say

590
00:25:32,248 --> 00:25:34,948
or something you don't
say will change 'em forever.

591
00:25:35,017 --> 00:25:36,416
Yes, ma'am.

592
00:25:36,485 --> 00:25:38,230
I was just thinking that
you're totally determining

593
00:25:38,254 --> 00:25:39,586
the course of this kid's life.

594
00:25:39,654 --> 00:25:41,455
You will determine
whether or not

595
00:25:41,524 --> 00:25:43,290
this kid gets made
fun of for his looks,

596
00:25:43,359 --> 00:25:46,543
or if he cries at his
school picture every year.

597
00:25:46,612 --> 00:25:51,065
And today, you will decide
who he goes to the prom with,

598
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:55,402
and who he will marry or I
mean, if he gets married at all,

599
00:25:55,470 --> 00:26:00,074
or if he dies alone,
unattractive and unloved.

600
00:26:08,801 --> 00:26:10,333
Did you want me to call Sloan?

601
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:16,674
Okay, I've isolated
the aneurysm.

602
00:26:16,742 --> 00:26:18,408
I can see the whole neck.

603
00:26:26,819 --> 00:26:28,969
What is that?

604
00:26:29,038 --> 00:26:30,637
It's an angled seven millimeter.

605
00:26:30,706 --> 00:26:32,517
I'd go smaller,
use a straight one.

606
00:26:32,541 --> 00:26:33,940
No. No?

607
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:36,688
You only get one shot
at this. Use a smaller clip.

608
00:26:36,712 --> 00:26:38,044
I may need the extra length.

609
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:39,441
You could hit one
of the perforators.

610
00:26:39,465 --> 00:26:40,731
Not if I look where I'm going.

611
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:42,249
Put the clip down.

612
00:26:45,904 --> 00:26:47,354
What are you doing now?

613
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:50,524
I am isolating the appendix.

614
00:26:52,511 --> 00:26:53,660
And now?

615
00:26:53,728 --> 00:26:57,047
I am cross-clamping
the appendix at the base.

616
00:26:58,033 --> 00:26:59,366
And what are you doing now?

617
00:27:12,548 --> 00:27:14,259
Okay, you can get
as pissed as you want,

618
00:27:14,283 --> 00:27:16,694
but there is a reason that
I'm having you do all this.

619
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:17,996
I want to... Shh.

620
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:20,587
I beg your
pardon? I don't... I...

621
00:27:22,842 --> 00:27:25,075
I can't remember
what comes next.

622
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:32,816
Anastomosis is holding.

623
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:35,919
Nice work.

624
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:39,056
Okay. We gotta run the bowel.

625
00:27:39,108 --> 00:27:41,374
Make sure there isn't any...

626
00:27:45,263 --> 00:27:48,315
Okay, crap. Okay...

627
00:27:48,383 --> 00:27:50,701
Cautery.

628
00:27:50,769 --> 00:27:52,547
Lift up peritoneum,
open transversely...

629
00:27:52,571 --> 00:27:54,199
All right, this is what
I am talking about.

630
00:27:54,223 --> 00:27:56,033
Why would I have you
replace... Deliver the appendix...

631
00:27:56,057 --> 00:27:58,403
A mitral valve when you
can't even remember a...

632
00:27:58,427 --> 00:28:00,360
I can if you just
please shut up.

633
00:28:03,332 --> 00:28:04,993
I can't tell if any
of this is viable.

634
00:28:05,017 --> 00:28:06,944
Well, what about here? I
mean, this... No, it's crap.

635
00:28:06,968 --> 00:28:08,880
Is the fluorescein in?
Have we started the dye?

636
00:28:08,904 --> 00:28:10,370
Starting now.

637
00:28:12,308 --> 00:28:13,339
It's in.

638
00:28:13,408 --> 00:28:14,608
Lights. Now. Kill the lights.

639
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:20,092
Use the five millimeter.

640
00:28:20,116 --> 00:28:22,816
I'm looking right at it,
Derek. You have to trust me.

641
00:28:22,884 --> 00:28:26,444
No, I've done it hundreds
of times. Use a smaller clip.

642
00:28:32,344 --> 00:28:33,610
Damn it.

643
00:28:40,252 --> 00:28:42,469
Okay, I'm gonna do
the matador move.

644
00:28:42,537 --> 00:28:45,538
Can I have the needle
and the Penfield retractor?

645
00:28:49,261 --> 00:28:50,501
I've got the suction.

646
00:28:52,163 --> 00:28:54,031
Okay, everybody, stop.

647
00:29:13,468 --> 00:29:16,703
Okay. It's holding.
Holding perfectly.

648
00:29:18,207 --> 00:29:19,923
Okay, suction, please.

649
00:29:23,128 --> 00:29:25,829
Come on. Come on.
Give me something.

650
00:29:25,898 --> 00:29:27,297
Alex, there's not enough.

651
00:29:27,365 --> 00:29:28,648
Shut up.

652
00:29:28,717 --> 00:29:30,016
Lights.

653
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:39,353
I can't remember the next step.

654
00:29:39,377 --> 00:29:41,678
Well, you might
remember this the next time

655
00:29:41,747 --> 00:29:44,531
you're screaming at an intern
for skipping the fundamentals.

656
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,816
Will you just do it, please?

657
00:29:46,885 --> 00:29:49,720
Take your time. It'll come back.

658
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:52,939
No, it won't. Honestly. I
can stand here all day.

659
00:29:53,007 --> 00:29:54,341
It's not gonna...

660
00:29:57,146 --> 00:29:59,146
Oh, my God. You
don't know, either.

661
00:29:59,198 --> 00:30:01,097
Don't try to make this about me.

662
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:02,443
Okay, then tell me what to do.

663
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:03,778
You should know what
to do. So should you.

664
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:04,913
Well, it's been even
longer since I've done one.

665
00:30:04,937 --> 00:30:05,980
Well, I need your help.

666
00:30:06,004 --> 00:30:08,004
We need to be
helping her right now.

667
00:30:08,073 --> 00:30:10,457
You probably want to
ligate at the proximal edge,

668
00:30:10,525 --> 00:30:12,070
apply a straight
clamp, and lay down

669
00:30:12,094 --> 00:30:13,788
a purse-string
suture at the base.

670
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:15,456
Right. Of course. Thank you.

671
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,080
I got it. I got it.

672
00:30:19,918 --> 00:30:22,385
No shame.

673
00:30:22,454 --> 00:30:25,388
No shame at all.
You're still the goober.

674
00:30:25,457 --> 00:30:27,357
It's Gunther. Sure.

675
00:30:30,896 --> 00:30:32,529
Uh, I can't...

676
00:30:32,597 --> 00:30:35,877
If I close him, I'm leaving
him to die. He'll die of sepsis.

677
00:30:36,585 --> 00:30:38,518
Can I revascularize?

678
00:30:38,587 --> 00:30:40,470
I can find the clot,

679
00:30:40,539 --> 00:30:44,757
I can do a transverse arteriotomy
and bypass the vessels.

680
00:30:44,826 --> 00:30:47,960
No. There's way too
much dead bowel.

681
00:30:48,029 --> 00:30:50,964
Do I pull it? I
mean... Do I pull it all?

682
00:30:51,033 --> 00:30:53,177
Put him on a transplant list?

683
00:30:53,201 --> 00:30:54,718
Hope for...

684
00:30:56,505 --> 00:30:58,454
What do I do?

685
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:00,540
Do I close him and let him go?

686
00:31:12,988 --> 00:31:14,471
Let's close.

687
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:34,091
Thank you. Thank you so much.

688
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:36,977
That's fine.

689
00:31:51,894 --> 00:31:53,505
Can we make a deal?
Let us never speak of this.

690
00:31:53,529 --> 00:31:54,694
Deal.

691
00:31:58,149 --> 00:31:59,315
Night.

692
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,326
Do you want me to talk to him?

693
00:32:27,396 --> 00:32:28,512
No.

694
00:32:30,199 --> 00:32:32,399
You did everything you could.

695
00:32:32,467 --> 00:32:34,885
You really did.

696
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:38,121
He won't be able to
understand that, but I do.

697
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:40,023
And you should, too.

698
00:33:48,694 --> 00:33:50,777
<i>I don't want to go home.</i>

699
00:33:50,845 --> 00:33:53,096
I don't, either.

700
00:33:53,165 --> 00:33:54,915
Do we really have
to talk about it?

701
00:33:54,983 --> 00:33:56,266
Yes, you do.

702
00:33:58,987 --> 00:34:00,703
Maybe I'll come over later.

703
00:34:00,772 --> 00:34:01,788
Oh, that would be great.

704
00:34:01,857 --> 00:34:03,067
No, actually, that would be bad,

705
00:34:03,091 --> 00:34:05,592
because that would
mean my marriage is over.

706
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:07,159
Here you go.

707
00:34:10,416 --> 00:34:11,782
Did you finish your shift?

708
00:34:13,869 --> 00:34:15,518
All right. So who lost the bet?

709
00:34:15,587 --> 00:34:17,804
Not me. My bomb
was defused perfectly.

710
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:19,010
My appy was flawless.

711
00:34:19,058 --> 00:34:20,752
Except it was
finished by a nurse.

712
00:34:20,776 --> 00:34:21,941
Who told you that?

713
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:24,730
Karev's guy didn't even
wake up. Septic shock.

714
00:34:26,031 --> 00:34:29,365
You blew a bowel resection?
That's like misspelling your own name.

715
00:34:29,434 --> 00:34:31,268
Hey, guys. No, it's Karev.

716
00:34:31,336 --> 00:34:34,821
Sorry, dude.
Enjoy that skills lab.

717
00:34:34,890 --> 00:34:38,725
Can I just point out that Jackson
never even touched his patient?

718
00:34:38,793 --> 00:34:40,833
Sloan did the whole procedure.

719
00:34:42,547 --> 00:34:44,027
What does "between
you and me" mean?

720
00:34:44,066 --> 00:34:47,300
So it would seem to me
that he loses by forfeit.

721
00:34:49,204 --> 00:34:50,632
Loser. Forfeit.

722
00:34:50,656 --> 00:34:51,988
I don't think that that's...

723
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,540
You want a rematch?

724
00:34:53,609 --> 00:34:55,759
We could go again tomorrow.

725
00:34:55,827 --> 00:34:57,787
And the next day.
And the next day.

726
00:35:11,743 --> 00:35:13,176
Nurses' station.

727
00:35:13,245 --> 00:35:15,078
Dr. Bailey. Hold up, please.

728
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:20,550
I learned in the army

729
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:22,830
that a leader is only as good
as the people around him.

730
00:35:22,854 --> 00:35:25,972
Now, you are one of the
best people on this team.

731
00:35:26,041 --> 00:35:27,541
And...

732
00:35:27,609 --> 00:35:31,310
I just want to make sure
that I have you on my side.

733
00:35:32,297 --> 00:35:33,796
Have I done something wrong?

734
00:35:33,865 --> 00:35:34,965
No.

735
00:35:35,033 --> 00:35:36,832
Is there something
in my job performance

736
00:35:36,901 --> 00:35:38,401
that prompts you to ask me this?

737
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:39,536
No.

738
00:35:39,605 --> 00:35:42,021
Or do you just
need me to like you?

739
00:35:43,675 --> 00:35:45,541
It's not that. Are you sure?

740
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,399
Carry on, Dr. Bailey.

741
00:36:00,108 --> 00:36:02,353
If you want to be mad at
someone, be mad at me.

742
00:36:02,377 --> 00:36:04,343
I'm not mad at
you. Yes, you are.

743
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:06,379
Everyone knows who to be mad at.

744
00:36:06,448 --> 00:36:08,225
The only thing
Meredith did to me

745
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:09,961
was to give my wife
a little more time,

746
00:36:09,985 --> 00:36:13,452
and I'm damn sure
gonna spend it with her.

747
00:36:13,521 --> 00:36:17,574
I'm happy, Bailey. I'd like
you to be happy for me, too.

748
00:36:20,895 --> 00:36:22,061
I'll try.

749
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:29,397
You're gonna have
to give me a while.

750
00:36:29,421 --> 00:36:30,820
I'll wait.

751
00:36:38,113 --> 00:36:39,345
Well...

752
00:36:40,415 --> 00:36:41,948
That was good.

753
00:36:50,158 --> 00:36:51,986
You know, I'll get the
dishes. No, no, no, I'll do it.

754
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:53,309
No, no, I've got them.

755
00:36:53,378 --> 00:36:55,712
You know, I've been feeling...

756
00:36:56,581 --> 00:36:57,680
Terrible.

757
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:00,349
Okay.

758
00:37:00,418 --> 00:37:01,584
No, I mean it.

759
00:37:05,591 --> 00:37:06,856
I know.

760
00:37:08,627 --> 00:37:10,867
Do you want to talk about it?

761
00:37:22,256 --> 00:37:23,840
Did you have the spring rolls?

762
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:40,485
We should never have been
in that OR together today.

763
00:37:40,509 --> 00:37:41,540
What do you mean?

764
00:37:41,609 --> 00:37:43,542
We're not a team, anywhere.

765
00:37:43,611 --> 00:37:44,878
And when we get Zola back,

766
00:37:44,946 --> 00:37:46,924
before we get that phone call,

767
00:37:46,948 --> 00:37:48,893
we need to figure
out if we can be one,

768
00:37:48,917 --> 00:37:53,253
if we can even be together. So
now's the time to say how you feel.

769
00:37:53,321 --> 00:37:55,821
I can't. I'm gonna
say things that are...

770
00:37:55,890 --> 00:37:57,190
Oh, Derek, just say it.

771
00:37:57,259 --> 00:37:59,320
Whatever it is,
we can deal with it.

772
00:37:59,344 --> 00:38:00,922
I can accept the consequences.

773
00:38:00,946 --> 00:38:04,014
Meredith, you have never
accepted a consequence in your life.

774
00:38:04,082 --> 00:38:05,426
Since the moment
you switched those files,

775
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:06,933
you haven't suffered one bit.

776
00:38:07,002 --> 00:38:08,212
That is not true.

777
00:38:08,236 --> 00:38:09,446
While those around
you have lost their jobs

778
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:11,098
and lost their reputations.
And I lost Zola.

779
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:12,489
So did I!

780
00:38:14,893 --> 00:38:16,559
Because you do things...

781
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:18,389
Without a thought, you just
dive in and never give a damn

782
00:38:18,413 --> 00:38:21,081
how deep the water is or
who you're gonna land on.

783
00:38:21,149 --> 00:38:23,394
I know I messed up,
but all of this happened

784
00:38:23,418 --> 00:38:25,685
before Zola was
even in the picture.

785
00:38:25,753 --> 00:38:27,198
Don't you think I've changed?

786
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:29,350
I don't think you can change.
You stole the baby, Meredith.

787
00:38:29,374 --> 00:38:31,084
Oh. I told you why I did that.

788
00:38:31,108 --> 00:38:32,870
What do you need,
for me to say I'm sorry?

789
00:38:32,894 --> 00:38:34,844
I need you to be sorry.

790
00:38:38,366 --> 00:38:39,577
Of course I'm sorry.

791
00:38:39,601 --> 00:38:41,701
You did it again
today in the OR.

792
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:44,387
What? I had a
successful surgery today.

793
00:38:44,456 --> 00:38:46,005
You refused to listen to me!

794
00:38:46,074 --> 00:38:48,452
I didn't listen to you because
I didn't need to listen to you.

795
00:38:48,476 --> 00:38:50,777
I knew what I was
doing and I was right.

796
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:54,242
You just couldn't trust me.

797
00:38:54,266 --> 00:38:56,299
Why should I ever trust you?

798
00:38:56,368 --> 00:38:57,483
Why should I trust you?

799
00:38:57,552 --> 00:38:59,368
You ended my trial,
you set back my career,

800
00:38:59,437 --> 00:39:01,482
you nearly ended your
own, you destroyed Richard's.

801
00:39:01,506 --> 00:39:03,806
I have no reason to trust you.

802
00:39:03,875 --> 00:39:05,536
Well, then why are you with me?

803
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:06,659
Because of that.

804
00:39:11,382 --> 00:39:13,249
Because I meant that!

805
00:39:17,088 --> 00:39:19,255
I promised I wouldn't run.

806
00:39:20,458 --> 00:39:21,658
I promised I would love you.

807
00:39:22,661 --> 00:39:23,901
Even when you hate me.

808
00:39:23,962 --> 00:39:25,962
Even when I hate you.

809
00:39:26,031 --> 00:39:27,263
I am trying, Meredith.

810
00:39:27,332 --> 00:39:30,166
I am trying, but you
make it so damn hard.

811
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:35,238
I understand.

812
00:39:35,306 --> 00:39:38,307
And I don't want you
to keep the promise,

813
00:39:38,377 --> 00:39:40,259
not if you don't want to,

814
00:39:40,328 --> 00:39:42,473
and not if you can't trust
me with our daughter.

815
00:39:42,497 --> 00:39:43,713
I do. I trust you with Zola.

816
00:39:43,781 --> 00:39:44,825
Well, you just said...

817
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:46,416
That's not what I said.

818
00:39:48,653 --> 00:39:50,870
I know that you took
her to protect her.

819
00:39:53,024 --> 00:39:55,464
I know that you altered the
trial for Adele and for Richard.

820
00:39:57,628 --> 00:39:59,645
You stood in front
of a bullet for me.

821
00:40:00,982 --> 00:40:02,815
I know why you do all of it.

822
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:07,753
It's what I love about you.

823
00:40:09,024 --> 00:40:10,856
And what you hate about me.

824
00:40:10,925 --> 00:40:12,058
Yeah.

825
00:40:32,564 --> 00:40:34,604
So you can't trust me at work?

826
00:40:35,333 --> 00:40:37,517
No, I can't.

827
00:40:37,585 --> 00:40:39,201
Well, that's easy, then.

828
00:40:47,295 --> 00:40:49,211
So we just don't work together.

829
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,640
So what are you saying?
I'm off your service.

830
00:40:50,664 --> 00:40:53,949
That's my consequence.

831
00:40:54,018 --> 00:40:56,163
If we want to stay together,
with or without Zola,

832
00:40:56,187 --> 00:40:58,554
we just can't work together.

833
00:40:58,623 --> 00:41:01,740
<i>Sometimes it
happens in an instant.</i>

834
00:41:01,809 --> 00:41:03,142
<i>We step up.</i>

835
00:41:03,211 --> 00:41:06,245
<i>We become a leader.
We see a path forward.</i>

836
00:41:06,314 --> 00:41:08,025
Never again.

837
00:41:08,049 --> 00:41:10,950
I told you not to order from that
place. Their floors are disgusting.

838
00:41:11,019 --> 00:41:13,197
Yeah, but then you always
say you like their spring rolls.

839
00:41:13,221 --> 00:41:14,954
Don't say...

840
00:41:15,023 --> 00:41:17,223
Don't say it.

841
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:20,293
Oh! Oh.

842
00:41:25,183 --> 00:41:26,432
Thank you.

843
00:41:28,019 --> 00:41:29,268
I'm not gonna kiss you.

844
00:41:35,259 --> 00:41:36,459
Let's go to bed.

845
00:41:36,527 --> 00:41:39,562
Oh, no, no, no, I
want to stay here.

846
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:40,880
Come on. Let's go to bed.

847
00:41:40,949 --> 00:41:43,027
Oh, no. It feels good
here. It feels good here.

848
00:41:43,051 --> 00:41:45,685
Okay. Come here.

849
00:41:47,088 --> 00:41:48,654
There you go.

850
00:41:48,723 --> 00:41:49,989
Oh!

851
00:41:57,482 --> 00:42:00,015
<i>We see a path, and we take it...</i>

852
00:42:12,296 --> 00:42:15,264
<i>Even when we have no
idea where we're going.</i>
