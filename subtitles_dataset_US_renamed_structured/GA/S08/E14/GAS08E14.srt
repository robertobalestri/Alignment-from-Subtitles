1
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:10,976
There's a baby in the bed.

2
00:00:11,045 --> 00:00:13,190
I know there's a
baby in the bed.

3
00:00:13,214 --> 00:00:14,696
There's no baby in the shower.

4
00:00:14,765 --> 00:00:16,843
There is no baby in the shower.

5
00:00:16,867 --> 00:00:18,199
All right.

6
00:00:23,707 --> 00:00:25,988
There's a baby
in the shower, too.

7
00:00:26,042 --> 00:00:27,503
Oh, come on. Just
look the other way.

8
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:29,561
I can't do it in
front of the duckies.

9
00:00:29,629 --> 00:00:31,241
Yes, you can. Do it
in front of the duckies.

10
00:00:31,265 --> 00:00:32,364
No. Come on.

11
00:00:32,432 --> 00:00:34,182
Where are we gonna go now?

12
00:00:34,251 --> 00:00:36,451
Okay, stop saying that.

13
00:00:39,356 --> 00:00:41,122
Good morning.

14
00:00:41,191 --> 00:00:42,491
Oh, my God.

15
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:44,387
Yeah, I'm watching
a pyeloplasty.

16
00:00:44,411 --> 00:00:45,589
I can rewind it back to
the beginning if you'd like.

17
00:00:45,613 --> 00:00:48,146
No, let's go.

18
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:50,076
Hey, listen for the baby. What?

19
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,132
Twenty minutes.

20
00:00:51,201 --> 00:00:52,334
Okay.

21
00:00:52,402 --> 00:00:54,169
Don't! Don't! Don't!

22
00:00:54,238 --> 00:00:55,503
Stop, Derek.

23
00:00:55,572 --> 00:00:57,005
Ow! Ow! What?

24
00:00:57,074 --> 00:00:58,151
Let's just try to
move the seat back.

25
00:00:58,175 --> 00:00:59,407
Okay, okay, okay.

26
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:00,720
Is that better? Yeah.

27
00:01:00,744 --> 00:01:02,494
Good. Come here. Okay.

28
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:06,931
I'm sorry, but she woke up,

29
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,378
and she seemed like
she wanted you guys.

30
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:10,430
But don't worry. She
didn't see anything.

31
00:01:10,454 --> 00:01:12,604
We're never gonna
have sex again, are we?

32
00:01:12,672 --> 00:01:14,005
Aw. Happy Valentine's Day.

33
00:01:17,594 --> 00:01:19,862
Okay, baby. There we go.

34
00:01:21,832 --> 00:01:23,643
Well, listen, I can
babysit tonight

35
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:25,934
if you guys need some
time to yourselves.

36
00:01:26,003 --> 00:01:29,237
'Cause I have no plans
'cause my life is empty.

37
00:01:29,306 --> 00:01:31,856
I'm alone with no
plans whatsoever, at all.

38
00:01:31,926 --> 00:01:33,642
That's great.

39
00:01:33,711 --> 00:01:35,839
So did you make a reservation

40
00:01:35,863 --> 00:01:38,541
somewhere beautiful with
lots of flickery candles?

41
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:41,016
I made a plan. I
think you'll like it.

42
00:01:41,085 --> 00:01:42,918
You should pack a bag. Oh, wow.

43
00:01:43,003 --> 00:01:45,363
Overnight? Oh, gosh.
Well, what about Sofia?

44
00:01:45,422 --> 00:01:48,573
Mark got a sitter. He'll be home
at 11:00, and then he's got her.

45
00:01:48,642 --> 00:01:50,370
All right. Well,
what should I bring?

46
00:01:50,394 --> 00:01:52,539
A bathing suit? Or I don't
know. What are we talking here?

47
00:01:52,563 --> 00:01:54,546
Uh, no bathing suit.
Boots wouldn't hurt.

48
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:57,982
All right. So, cold.

49
00:01:58,051 --> 00:01:59,434
Could be.

50
00:01:59,503 --> 00:02:01,970
Wouldn't hurt to bring long
underwear, extra fleece.

51
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:03,116
Yeah. Hey, don't make that face.

52
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:04,140
No.

53
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:07,092
It will be fun. Yeah. Romantic.

54
00:02:07,161 --> 00:02:08,671
<i>There are times in our lives</i>

55
00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:10,573
<i>when love really
does conquer all.</i>

56
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:12,564
<i>Exhaustion,</i>

57
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:14,633
<i>sleep deprivation,</i>

58
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:16,268
<i>anything.</i>

59
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:17,847
<i>And then there are those times</i>

60
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:19,937
<i>when it seems like
love brings us nothing</i>

61
00:02:21,775 --> 00:02:22,874
<i>but pain.</i>

62
00:02:28,331 --> 00:02:29,931
Tonight is still
gonna work out, right?

63
00:02:29,967 --> 00:02:31,811
Of course it is. We have a plan.

64
00:02:31,835 --> 00:02:34,368
I'm just saying
you cancel a lot,

65
00:02:34,438 --> 00:02:36,216
because of the scalpels
and cutting people open.

66
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,635
Look, I was promised
an elegant dinner.

67
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:40,854
I rearranged my whole schedule.

68
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:43,745
I've got high heels
in the back of my car.

69
00:02:46,417 --> 00:02:49,017
I'm gonna spend all
day thinking about them.

70
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:50,419
Is it camping?

71
00:02:50,487 --> 00:02:52,532
I mean, does she think I'm
going camping on Valentine's Day?

72
00:02:52,556 --> 00:02:53,922
I don't know.

73
00:02:53,991 --> 00:02:56,035
Well, she's trying to
surprise me. I'm telling you,

74
00:02:56,059 --> 00:02:57,654
the surprise is gonna be, I'm gonna
leave her on the side of a mountain.

75
00:02:57,678 --> 00:02:59,961
I mean, do you think
camping is sexy? It's not sexy.

76
00:03:00,047 --> 00:03:02,725
You can't take a baby
camping. Sofia's gonna hate it.

77
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:04,850
What... You're getting a sitter.

78
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:06,163
Callie said you're
getting a sitter.

79
00:03:06,187 --> 00:03:08,397
Yeah, Callie also said
you were going camping.

80
00:03:08,421 --> 00:03:10,021
Callie's lost her mind.

81
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:11,823
Ugh! Really, it's camping?

82
00:03:11,892 --> 00:03:14,654
I don't know, but it's
your night with Sofia.

83
00:03:14,678 --> 00:03:16,205
Well, I need to have
sex with my wife,

84
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:18,374
apparently in the woods
on cold, hard ground.

85
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:20,576
And you promised Callie
a sitter, so get a sitter.

86
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,552
Come on. This thing with
Julia is young and fragile.

87
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,987
There's a lot of pressure. I
got us a table at Campo's.

88
00:03:26,056 --> 00:03:28,256
Well, then you
better find a sitter.

89
00:03:32,178 --> 00:03:34,345
I have plans.

90
00:03:34,415 --> 00:03:36,448
Yep. I got a hot date.

91
00:03:36,517 --> 00:03:39,651
Our thing is young
and fragile, too.

92
00:03:41,605 --> 00:03:43,555
We're gonna get a
zillion valen-traumas.

93
00:03:43,624 --> 00:03:45,936
I bet a few of them will be
good surgeries for our boards.

94
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,803
Well, it's not Saint Patty's
Day. Those are good traumas.

95
00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:49,877
Car crashes, bar brawls.

96
00:03:49,946 --> 00:03:52,241
Yeah, Valentine's Day is all
swallowed engagement rings

97
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:54,027
and guys who threw out
their backs getting laid.

98
00:03:54,051 --> 00:03:55,394
You're just bitter 'cause
you don't have a date.

99
00:03:55,418 --> 00:03:57,263
First of all,
Valentine's Day isn't

100
00:03:57,287 --> 00:03:59,398
for having a date
with some chick.

101
00:03:59,422 --> 00:04:01,634
No, it's for macking the
chicks who don't have dates.

102
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:03,978
Besides, I have to
study for my boards.

103
00:04:05,195 --> 00:04:06,361
You studying already?

104
00:04:06,429 --> 00:04:07,629
Of course. You're not?

105
00:04:07,698 --> 00:04:10,198
No, I am.

106
00:04:10,266 --> 00:04:11,750
Who put up all this? I did.

107
00:04:13,052 --> 00:04:15,353
Well, research shows
that a cheerful environment

108
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:17,990
reduces stress and helps
patients to feel more...

109
00:04:21,295 --> 00:04:22,410
Wow.

110
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,045
Okay.

111
00:04:24,114 --> 00:04:26,292
I have to get that
baby out of my bed.

112
00:04:26,316 --> 00:04:27,883
She's ruining my sex life.

113
00:04:27,951 --> 00:04:29,751
Yeah, well, mine's already dead.

114
00:04:33,957 --> 00:04:35,123
He's gonna leave me.

115
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:36,703
He won't. Yeah, he will. He is.

116
00:04:36,727 --> 00:04:39,243
I mean, I know it.
And you know what?

117
00:04:39,313 --> 00:04:40,545
I don't care.

118
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:42,247
You know, if he wants to leave,

119
00:04:42,316 --> 00:04:43,949
if he wants to
hate me, then fine.

120
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:45,600
I can't make someone stay.

121
00:04:45,669 --> 00:04:47,513
Well, you could kind
of beg him to stay.

122
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:51,072
I'm busy. I'm
focused. I'm a surgeon.

123
00:04:51,141 --> 00:04:52,719
Well, everyone's a
surgeon. That doesn't mean...

124
00:04:52,743 --> 00:04:54,593
It does. For me, it does.

125
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:58,430
I'm brilliant. I'm
gifted. I don't beg.

126
00:04:58,499 --> 00:05:02,083
You know, if he wants
to go, then fine. I'm good.

127
00:05:04,755 --> 00:05:07,033
Hey, have you guys started
studying for your boards?

128
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:08,418
Yeah. Yeah. Why?

129
00:05:08,442 --> 00:05:09,875
Yeah. Cool. Me, too.

130
00:05:09,943 --> 00:05:11,376
I need labs in bed six.

131
00:05:11,444 --> 00:05:13,027
About time, Grey.
Bed three. Okay.

132
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:17,032
Well, anything for me?

133
00:05:21,221 --> 00:05:23,788
Six weeks of
headaches, like blinding.

134
00:05:23,857 --> 00:05:25,502
We were in here last
week. They did a brain scan,

135
00:05:25,526 --> 00:05:26,636
but they didn't find anything.

136
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,804
Said it was probably a migraine,

137
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:29,360
but the pills don't help at all.

138
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:31,607
Janell, can you rate your pain
for me on a scale of 1 to 10?

139
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:34,215
This morning, it
was, like, an 11.

140
00:05:34,284 --> 00:05:36,601
But now it's more like a...

141
00:05:38,906 --> 00:05:40,905
Janell? Honey?

142
00:05:40,974 --> 00:05:42,623
Janell? Can you hear me?

143
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:44,692
Does this happen a lot?

144
00:05:44,762 --> 00:05:46,061
Yeah. She just shuts down

145
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:47,706
'cause the pain's too
much or something.

146
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:49,770
We need an EEG over here.
And let's page Shepherd.

147
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,640
- Quickly, please.
- Right away.

148
00:05:51,668 --> 00:05:53,145
This isn't a migraine,
right? No, it's not a migraine.

149
00:05:53,169 --> 00:05:54,536
She's having a seizure.

150
00:05:56,723 --> 00:05:59,257
I have been off of Dr. Altman's
service now for two weeks.

151
00:05:59,325 --> 00:06:01,559
I stepped over a line.
You reprimanded me.

152
00:06:01,628 --> 00:06:02,705
Continuing to punish me is...

153
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:03,849
Fine.

154
00:06:05,015 --> 00:06:06,255
You're on her service.

155
00:06:15,926 --> 00:06:17,725
Get down!

156
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:19,393
Look out!

157
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:24,348
What was that?

158
00:06:29,256 --> 00:06:31,105
Is everybody okay?

159
00:06:32,008 --> 00:06:33,574
Are you okay?

160
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:34,659
Yes.

161
00:06:35,362 --> 00:06:36,595
You sure?

162
00:06:37,664 --> 00:06:38,930
Yes.

163
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:57,582
Airway seems fine,
but he's got some JVD.

164
00:06:57,651 --> 00:06:59,428
He's tachycardic with
muffled heart sounds.

165
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:00,985
What happened?

166
00:07:01,054 --> 00:07:02,866
Sir, you're at Seattle
Grace-Mercy West hospital.

167
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:04,356
Your van crashed.

168
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:05,985
No one was hurt, but we need
to get you examined. Come on.

169
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:07,537
I must have fallen asleep
at the wheel for a second.

170
00:07:07,561 --> 00:07:09,521
I've been working
like a dog all week.

171
00:07:09,546 --> 00:07:12,430
God. No, no,
no. I gotta go. I...

172
00:07:12,499 --> 00:07:13,759
Sir, relax, relax.
Just lie down.

173
00:07:13,783 --> 00:07:15,745
No, I have to go. I'm a florist.

174
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:17,747
These roses won't last in the
open air. They're gonna wilt.

175
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:19,866
Sir, you need to calm down.
We're gonna get you out of here.

176
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:21,673
Maintain in-line stabilization.

177
00:07:21,742 --> 00:07:23,152
We need to get trauma
labs, films, and ultrasound.

178
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:25,254
Make sure that CT is
available, and page Altman.

179
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:26,358
Right away, Doctor.

180
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:32,394
She's not responding to the
seizure medication, Randy.

181
00:07:32,418 --> 00:07:34,936
She is in serious danger of
suffering severe brain damage,

182
00:07:35,004 --> 00:07:37,889
which is why I'd like to place
her in a medically-induced coma.

183
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,038
A coma? What do you mean?

184
00:07:39,092 --> 00:07:40,202
Basically, a deep sleep

185
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:41,921
to prevent the seizures
from damaging her brain.

186
00:07:41,945 --> 00:07:43,556
It will also buy us some time

187
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:45,040
so we can figure out
what's causing them.

188
00:07:45,064 --> 00:07:46,665
She just turned 32.

189
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:49,567
We've never talked about
medical decision-type stuff.

190
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:52,615
Well, every seizure Janell has
hurts her brain a little bit more.

191
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:53,971
We need to do this now.

192
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:01,529
Oh, God. Yeah. Please do it.

193
00:08:01,598 --> 00:08:02,747
Okay. Do it, please.

194
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,310
Push 150 milligrams of propofol.

195
00:08:04,334 --> 00:08:07,254
Call respiratory while
I prep for intubation.

196
00:08:14,761 --> 00:08:16,744
Kepner, forget the flowers.

197
00:08:16,813 --> 00:08:19,047
Throw them out
and get back to work.

198
00:08:22,152 --> 00:08:23,535
Kepner.

199
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:25,565
You're not throwing
those flowers away?

200
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:26,621
But he...

201
00:08:26,689 --> 00:08:27,809
He doesn't need to know.

202
00:08:34,381 --> 00:08:36,665
Throwing away
perfectly good flowers.

203
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,377
Everyone's a cynic these days.

204
00:08:38,401 --> 00:08:40,835
Talking about not
believing in Valentine's Day.

205
00:08:40,921 --> 00:08:42,498
I mean, what's wrong with a day

206
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,822
devoted to the person you love?

207
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:46,903
I take this day very seriously.

208
00:08:46,927 --> 00:08:49,327
I know you do.
Happy anniversary, sir.

209
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,613
Thank you, Dr. Grey.

210
00:08:52,682 --> 00:08:54,082
I'm getting home early,

211
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:57,085
try and spend most
of the day with my wife.

212
00:08:57,153 --> 00:08:59,354
What about you?
You hitting the town?

213
00:08:59,423 --> 00:09:01,839
I'm not hitting much
of anything these days.

214
00:09:03,059 --> 00:09:05,059
Oh, God. I'm sorry.

215
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:06,394
That was crass.

216
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:10,532
I have no Valentine's plans.

217
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,977
What the hell was I thinking?

218
00:09:12,001 --> 00:09:13,346
I should've listened to my mom.

219
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:15,603
I used to be young!
I used to be pretty!

220
00:09:15,672 --> 00:09:17,650
I have wasted my
entire youth on you!

221
00:09:17,674 --> 00:09:19,519
Charlie Bilson, 32, hit by a car

222
00:09:19,543 --> 00:09:21,320
when he ran
head-on into traffic.

223
00:09:21,344 --> 00:09:23,272
Complains of
chest and back pain.

224
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:25,447
Has abdominal
tenderness and palpation.

225
00:09:25,515 --> 00:09:27,160
And it looks like a broken nose.

226
00:09:27,184 --> 00:09:28,461
I cannot believe you did this!

227
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:30,029
Okay, if you hadn't made
me chase you down...

228
00:09:30,053 --> 00:09:31,430
You should not have chased
me. You shouldn't have bothered,

229
00:09:31,454 --> 00:09:32,615
because it's over.

230
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:33,750
This is over.

231
00:09:33,774 --> 00:09:35,290
What happened?

232
00:09:35,358 --> 00:09:36,753
We're having breakfast in bed.
One second, you're so happy...

233
00:09:36,777 --> 00:09:39,217
I thought you were
going to propose!

234
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:42,208
Well, what do you think?

235
00:09:42,232 --> 00:09:44,899
Well, she's wheezing,
but we'll treat that.

236
00:09:44,967 --> 00:09:46,779
You're gonna be just fine, um...

237
00:09:46,803 --> 00:09:49,237
Clementine. I think
the kids call her Clem.

238
00:09:49,305 --> 00:09:50,449
You're not the mom?

239
00:09:50,473 --> 00:09:52,306
She's on her way.
She was at the gym.

240
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:54,586
I'm just the moron that bought
the box of peanut clusters

241
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:56,344
for the kid who's
allergic to nuts.

242
00:09:56,412 --> 00:09:58,496
My son wanted to
give her a valentine.

243
00:09:58,564 --> 00:09:59,959
She took a bite,
and this happened.

244
00:09:59,983 --> 00:10:01,744
I'm gonna start you on
a breathing treatment.

245
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:03,679
And then I'm gonna give
you an IV with medicine

246
00:10:03,703 --> 00:10:05,052
to treat the rash, okay?

247
00:10:05,121 --> 00:10:06,841
Okay. All right.

248
00:10:09,159 --> 00:10:11,825
Here. If it hurts, you
can squeeze my hand,

249
00:10:11,894 --> 00:10:13,294
hard as you want.

250
00:10:15,231 --> 00:10:16,964
Okay, Clem, here we go.

251
00:10:17,501 --> 00:10:18,916
Ready?

252
00:10:18,986 --> 00:10:21,185
One, two...

253
00:10:21,254 --> 00:10:22,920
Three. Okay.

254
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:24,089
Good.

255
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:27,075
Honestly, those little boxes?

256
00:10:27,143 --> 00:10:28,442
They taunt me, Charlie.

257
00:10:28,511 --> 00:10:30,656
I would rather a nice coffee
table book or maybe even a mug,

258
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,358
because then at least I
wouldn't get my hopes up

259
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:33,509
every freaking Valentine's Day

260
00:10:33,533 --> 00:10:35,283
when you pull out
the little velvet box.

261
00:10:35,352 --> 00:10:36,495
You didn't even
look at the necklace.

262
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:38,703
I didn't have to.
It wasn't a ring.

263
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:40,221
Oh, that's a

264
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:42,239
pretty nasty cut there.

265
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:43,491
Dr. Grey.

266
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,460
You want to take a look?

267
00:10:45,528 --> 00:10:46,827
Sure.

268
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:47,936
Come with me.

269
00:10:59,176 --> 00:11:01,609
A man should get
to bleed in peace.

270
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:03,778
Thanks.

271
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:09,217
What? Mmm.

272
00:11:09,286 --> 00:11:12,187
I was trying to figure out why
this patient's having seizures

273
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:13,983
when I noticed she
has a hemolytic anemia.

274
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:16,068
Which means she's having
an autoimmune response.

275
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:18,587
Right. If antibodies are
attacking her red blood cells,

276
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:21,140
who's to say that antibodies
couldn't be attacking her brain,

277
00:11:21,164 --> 00:11:22,663
causing the encephalitis?

278
00:11:22,732 --> 00:11:25,499
And it's not a brain tumor.
That's why you paged me.

279
00:11:25,568 --> 00:11:27,129
Well, yeah, and I
thought we could

280
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:28,664
spend Valentine's Day together.

281
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:31,122
Uh, you may not have
Valentine's Day plans,

282
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:33,619
but I do, Grey, plans that
I am not willing to forfeit.

283
00:11:33,643 --> 00:11:35,142
So here's how
this is going to go.

284
00:11:35,211 --> 00:11:36,911
In a timely and
efficient manner,

285
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:40,448
you and I will rule out
everything that could be causing

286
00:11:40,517 --> 00:11:42,032
this woman's
body to attack itself,

287
00:11:42,101 --> 00:11:44,452
virus by virus, tumor by tumor,

288
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:46,470
until we land on
the one thing...

289
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,006
It's a teratoma. What?

290
00:11:48,075 --> 00:11:50,742
I sent off Janell's
CSF from her spinal tap

291
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:52,604
for anti-NMDA
receptor antibodies,

292
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:54,406
and it just came back positive.

293
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:55,729
Show-off.

294
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:57,431
Let's get a scan.

295
00:12:06,108 --> 00:12:07,542
Is this our flower guy?

296
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:09,588
Yeah. He has an intrapericardial
diaphragmatic hernia.

297
00:12:09,612 --> 00:12:11,156
Whoa. How did his
abdominal organs

298
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,692
get into the sac
around his heart?

299
00:12:12,716 --> 00:12:14,026
His chest hit the
wheel when he crashed.

300
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:16,167
Well, I'm gonna have
to reduce the hernia.

301
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:18,653
Book an OR. Bump any
nonemergent patients,

302
00:12:18,722 --> 00:12:22,039
and find someone
to scrub in with me.

303
00:12:22,109 --> 00:12:24,487
Dr. Hunt has agreed to
let me back on your service,

304
00:12:24,511 --> 00:12:25,977
so I can scrub in with you.

305
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:27,395
Really?

306
00:12:27,464 --> 00:12:28,941
We need to get in
there and do the repair

307
00:12:28,965 --> 00:12:30,198
before he tamponades,

308
00:12:30,266 --> 00:12:33,134
so we should move
as quickly as possible.

309
00:12:33,203 --> 00:12:34,652
Like I'm ever anything but.

310
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,936
You must think I'm such a bitch.

311
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,892
No.

312
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:43,294
It's been eight years,

313
00:12:43,363 --> 00:12:45,241
and it's every Valentine's Day,

314
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:46,747
the buildup gets worse.

315
00:12:46,816 --> 00:12:48,894
This morning he wakes
me up, and breakfast in bed,

316
00:12:48,918 --> 00:12:51,463
and then he tells me he booked
dinner and a nice hotel at the pier,

317
00:12:51,487 --> 00:12:54,222
and then he pulls out
another cheap-ass necklace.

318
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:56,574
Eight years.

319
00:12:56,643 --> 00:12:58,243
We're not exactly teenagers.

320
00:12:58,311 --> 00:13:01,378
Mmm. Maybe he doesn't
know how much you want it.

321
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:05,016
We go to 20 weddings a year,
and I sob like a lunatic at every one.

322
00:13:05,085 --> 00:13:06,312
I'm not that sentimental.

323
00:13:06,336 --> 00:13:08,569
He knows. He knows.

324
00:13:09,806 --> 00:13:11,972
CT shows extensive
internal bleeding.

325
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,257
He's also hypotensive.

326
00:13:13,326 --> 00:13:14,804
We have to get him
up to the OR. Now.

327
00:13:14,828 --> 00:13:16,305
What's going on?
What's happening?

328
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:17,978
We're taking your
fiance to surgery.

329
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:22,433
He is not her fiance.

330
00:13:33,947 --> 00:13:34,979
Suction.

331
00:13:42,005 --> 00:13:43,132
Yeah, watch the...

332
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:44,236
Sorry. Sorry.

333
00:13:47,627 --> 00:13:49,961
So anybody got any
good Valentine's plans?

334
00:13:55,218 --> 00:13:58,419
My husband died in
this OR a month ago.

335
00:13:58,488 --> 00:14:00,371
Dr. Yang performed the surgery.

336
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:04,292
I was in a seven hour surgery
and didn't know that he had died.

337
00:14:04,377 --> 00:14:06,343
Dr. Hunt kept that a secret.

338
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:07,878
So I don't speak to him.

339
00:14:10,066 --> 00:14:12,500
He wants a baby.
Dr. Yang doesn't.

340
00:14:12,569 --> 00:14:15,953
So they don't speak to each
other even though they're married.

341
00:14:16,556 --> 00:14:18,106
So...

342
00:14:18,675 --> 00:14:19,874
No.

343
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:22,109
How about you?

344
00:14:24,246 --> 00:14:26,242
Um, my girlfriend
and I are gonna...

345
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:30,634
Nothing.

346
00:14:31,104 --> 00:14:32,503
Nothing.

347
00:14:37,177 --> 00:14:39,377
We think this thing
on Janell's lung

348
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:41,579
is something called a teratoma.

349
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:44,048
It's creating antibodies
that are attacking her brain.

350
00:14:44,934 --> 00:14:46,400
Well, I don't get it.

351
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:49,336
Basically, her body sees
the tumor as an invader

352
00:14:49,405 --> 00:14:50,804
and is attacking it,

353
00:14:50,873 --> 00:14:53,207
and her brain is getting
hurt in the crossfire.

354
00:14:53,276 --> 00:14:56,160
So this thing on her lung
is causing her seizures?

355
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:57,495
I think so.

356
00:14:57,564 --> 00:14:59,897
We'll have to remove it
and test it to make sure.

357
00:14:59,966 --> 00:15:02,900
Okay, so you take it
out, her headaches stop,

358
00:15:02,969 --> 00:15:04,947
and she wakes up from the coma,

359
00:15:04,971 --> 00:15:07,132
and we get to go
on to live our lives?

360
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:08,723
That's the plan.

361
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:10,891
Okay.

362
00:15:17,734 --> 00:15:20,802
We've known each
other since high school.

363
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:24,421
She's my better half.

364
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,607
I mean, I know people
always say that...

365
00:15:28,144 --> 00:15:29,393
But she really is.

366
00:15:31,797 --> 00:15:33,926
You paged me for this?
Why would I do this?

367
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:35,232
Because it's fair.

368
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:37,718
Because the three of us
are equal parents to Sofia

369
00:15:37,787 --> 00:15:41,772
and this is the fair way to
decide who stays in with her.

370
00:15:41,841 --> 00:15:44,959
Unless you'd rather raise her with
no sense of fairness or decency,

371
00:15:45,028 --> 00:15:47,461
in anarchy and chaos.

372
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:48,646
Your call.

373
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:49,947
Okay. Fine.

374
00:15:50,016 --> 00:15:52,176
Best two out of three?
Best two out of three.

375
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:54,251
You ready?

376
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,953
Rock, paper, scissors.

377
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:58,922
Rock, paper, scissors.

378
00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:00,869
My rock crushes your scissors.

379
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:03,360
Rock... Hold on,
hold on. Time-out.

380
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:05,469
Time-out? I'm sorry, time-out?

381
00:16:05,515 --> 00:16:06,780
Jackson, team huddle.

382
00:16:06,849 --> 00:16:08,026
Oh, my gosh. Are
you guys kidding me?

383
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,377
I mean, some of
us have surgeries.

384
00:16:09,401 --> 00:16:11,430
Can you just give us a second?

385
00:16:11,454 --> 00:16:12,547
What do you think?

386
00:16:12,571 --> 00:16:13,871
I think she's going paper.

387
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,484
She's going with rocks. I'm
thinking she's a rock thrower.

388
00:16:15,508 --> 00:16:16,952
Yeah, that's what she
wants you to think. All right?

389
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,353
That's why she did
it two times in a row.

390
00:16:18,377 --> 00:16:20,794
This time, trust
me. Go scissors.

391
00:16:20,863 --> 00:16:22,591
Okay, you guys, it's
not a chess game.

392
00:16:22,615 --> 00:16:24,443
Can we just do
this? Get out there.

393
00:16:24,467 --> 00:16:25,482
Wow.

394
00:16:27,537 --> 00:16:28,870
All right.

395
00:16:31,274 --> 00:16:32,339
Here we go.

396
00:16:34,077 --> 00:16:35,442
Rock, paper, scissors.

397
00:16:35,511 --> 00:16:36,672
No! Yes!

398
00:16:36,696 --> 00:16:37,912
Damn it!

399
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,391
I'm getting lucky tonight.
Happy babysitting.

400
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:40,693
See you later. All right.

401
00:16:40,717 --> 00:16:43,884
Avery, I said rocks.
My gut told me rocks.

402
00:16:43,953 --> 00:16:45,948
You messed with my
head. You asked my opinion.

403
00:16:45,972 --> 00:16:47,505
Julia's gonna kill me.

404
00:16:50,126 --> 00:16:51,704
She's having a severe reaction.

405
00:16:51,728 --> 00:16:54,688
Sorry, Clem. It looks like I'm
gonna have to give you a shot.

406
00:16:55,164 --> 00:16:56,597
Hand?

407
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:58,032
Yes, please.

408
00:16:58,101 --> 00:16:59,900
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

409
00:17:01,537 --> 00:17:02,970
Oh, Clem.

410
00:17:03,038 --> 00:17:06,090
Oh, honey. You poor thing.

411
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:07,586
Hi, Mom. She's gonna be fine.

412
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:09,371
The doctor's gonna give
her a shot. He's on top of it.

413
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:11,407
Well, I'm glad someone is.
- I didn't know.

414
00:17:11,431 --> 00:17:13,325
The school sends
home notes all the time.

415
00:17:13,349 --> 00:17:15,082
It's in every newsletter.

416
00:17:15,151 --> 00:17:16,779
She can't even be
near peanut butter.

417
00:17:16,803 --> 00:17:18,643
I have a job, Terri,
okay? Three kids.

418
00:17:18,687 --> 00:17:20,733
Excuse me if I don't read every
note the school sends home.

419
00:17:20,757 --> 00:17:23,557
I gave her a shot of
epinephrine. It should do the trick.

420
00:17:26,645 --> 00:17:27,911
He's hypothermic.

421
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,680
Yeah. There's too much bleeding.

422
00:17:29,749 --> 00:17:31,389
He's not gonna make
it if we keep going.

423
00:17:31,434 --> 00:17:35,403
Let's pack him and get him
up to ICU to stabilize him.

424
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:36,899
I am not babysitting.

425
00:17:36,923 --> 00:17:40,191
I have made your
career, and I can break it.

426
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:41,893
I need to check for
a septal hematoma.

427
00:17:41,961 --> 00:17:43,441
I'll be quick. I
got a date tonight.

428
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:45,174
What makes you
think I could babysit?

429
00:17:45,198 --> 00:17:47,615
Well, you know CPR,
you can think on your feet,

430
00:17:47,684 --> 00:17:49,016
you're fit,

431
00:17:49,084 --> 00:17:51,029
you can run out of a
burning building in no time.

432
00:17:51,053 --> 00:17:52,169
Septum looks fine.

433
00:17:53,606 --> 00:17:55,756
And I'm not gonna cancel
a date on Valentine's Day.

434
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:58,025
Women claim that they
don't care, but they all do,

435
00:17:58,094 --> 00:17:59,594
a lot.

436
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:02,129
Okay, let's prep him for ICU,
and I'll stay and monitor him.

437
00:18:02,198 --> 00:18:03,709
No, it's your
anniversary. I'll stay.

438
00:18:03,733 --> 00:18:05,477
I thought you had a hot date.

439
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:07,351
Really? With who?

440
00:18:09,122 --> 00:18:10,237
Uh...

441
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:13,607
Dr. Sloan, I mean,

442
00:18:13,676 --> 00:18:15,559
if you're finished
here, we'd like to...

443
00:18:15,628 --> 00:18:16,988
Oh, I'll tell you
who's finished.

444
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:18,362
You're finished.

445
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:24,750
Thank you.

446
00:18:40,753 --> 00:18:43,254
I already pressed it.

447
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:44,755
Whatever.

448
00:19:08,882 --> 00:19:10,122
I'm moving out.

449
00:19:15,672 --> 00:19:18,912
So if you need me, I'll
be at my mom's till I, uh,

450
00:19:20,309 --> 00:19:22,610
figure something out.

451
00:19:30,886 --> 00:19:32,019
Okay?

452
00:19:39,962 --> 00:19:41,028
Okay.

453
00:19:56,328 --> 00:19:59,396
Hey, I got your message
your lung resection went long.

454
00:19:59,465 --> 00:20:00,842
I pushed our
reservations to 8:00.

455
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:02,844
Really? Just like that
on Valentine's Day?

456
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,134
I got connections.

457
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,514
I could even push
them to 9:00 if you like.

458
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:06,715
No. Absolutely not. No.

459
00:20:06,739 --> 00:20:08,004
As soon as path confirms

460
00:20:08,073 --> 00:20:10,774
that the mass we took
out was the teratoma,

461
00:20:10,843 --> 00:20:13,794
I will go out to my
car, grab those heels...

462
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:17,481
Benign granuloma.

463
00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:21,630
All right, fine. Push
the reservation to 9:00.

464
00:20:21,654 --> 00:20:23,494
Mmm-hmm.

465
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:28,092
Why are you still
here? You can go.

466
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,828
I'd love to. I'd
love nothing more.

467
00:20:30,897 --> 00:20:33,508
But Nico won't leave until he
knows Clem's gonna be okay.

468
00:20:33,532 --> 00:20:35,766
He's 10. Who's the parent here?

469
00:20:35,834 --> 00:20:37,384
You let that kid run wild.

470
00:20:37,453 --> 00:20:38,897
At least I don't hover over him,

471
00:20:38,921 --> 00:20:40,299
afraid to let him
out of my sight.

472
00:20:40,323 --> 00:20:41,667
Well, maybe I need to hover

473
00:20:41,691 --> 00:20:43,201
because you and your
son won't leave us alone.

474
00:20:43,225 --> 00:20:44,942
What were you
thinking, dropping him

475
00:20:45,011 --> 00:20:46,455
at my house today
when I wasn't home?

476
00:20:46,479 --> 00:20:47,745
He wasn't gonna stay.

477
00:20:47,814 --> 00:20:49,190
He just wanted to give
your spoiled daughter

478
00:20:49,214 --> 00:20:51,009
a box of freaking chocolates.

479
00:20:51,033 --> 00:20:53,378
Well, stop giving us things. We barely
survived the head lice he gave her.

480
00:20:53,402 --> 00:20:56,069
You have no way of knowing
who gave who the head lice.

481
00:20:56,138 --> 00:20:57,471
Okay, that's enough.

482
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:59,824
They're 10. They're
in love. They're cute.

483
00:20:59,892 --> 00:21:01,353
Let them be cute,
for crying out loud.

484
00:21:01,377 --> 00:21:03,660
Excuse me, Doctor,
something's wrong with Clem.

485
00:21:03,713 --> 00:21:05,746
She's breathing funny.

486
00:21:05,815 --> 00:21:07,080
Get me a size 6 ET tube.

487
00:21:07,149 --> 00:21:08,749
What's happening?

488
00:21:08,818 --> 00:21:10,746
Her airway is shutting down.
I'm gonna have to intubate.

489
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,135
Oh, my God.

490
00:21:12,204 --> 00:21:14,485
Here you go. Give me
some crike pressure.

491
00:21:19,696 --> 00:21:20,936
All right. I'm in.

492
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:25,316
There's good color change.

493
00:21:25,384 --> 00:21:26,850
SATs are coming up.

494
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:29,437
What happened?
Anaphylactic shock.

495
00:21:29,505 --> 00:21:32,117
We're gonna have to keep her
overnight and see how she responds.

496
00:21:32,141 --> 00:21:33,457
But she's gonna be okay?

497
00:21:33,526 --> 00:21:35,008
Yeah, yeah, I think so.

498
00:21:35,828 --> 00:21:38,429
Now will you go? Please.

499
00:21:42,368 --> 00:21:46,403
It doesn't make any sense. Janell's
labs show she has a teratoma.

500
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:49,106
Then the lucky
woman has two tumors.

501
00:21:49,175 --> 00:21:51,208
The benign one that we
just took out of her lung

502
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:53,026
and another one...

503
00:21:53,096 --> 00:21:54,462
Where?

504
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:57,141
Her scans and her
ultrasound are clean.

505
00:21:57,165 --> 00:21:58,799
What if it's microscopic?

506
00:21:58,867 --> 00:22:00,684
Okay, um...

507
00:22:00,753 --> 00:22:04,688
What do we know about
NMDA receptor teratomas?

508
00:22:04,757 --> 00:22:08,692
We know they're most
commonly found on the ovaries.

509
00:22:11,397 --> 00:22:14,376
You want to take out her
ovaries? She's 32 years old.

510
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,468
They're always 32 and
nice and undeserving.

511
00:22:17,536 --> 00:22:19,576
These kind of things don't
happen to nasty people.

512
00:22:21,907 --> 00:22:24,425
His vitals are
holding. That's good.

513
00:22:26,362 --> 00:22:28,762
His pupils are
a little sluggish.

514
00:22:30,616 --> 00:22:32,215
Sharon, are you okay?

515
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:34,201
Can I get you anything?

516
00:22:35,104 --> 00:22:37,971
I had a ring picked out.

517
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:42,192
I sent a picture of
it to all of my sisters

518
00:22:42,261 --> 00:22:46,880
so they could help Charlie
surprise me when the time came,

519
00:22:46,949 --> 00:22:49,650
'cause that ring was important.

520
00:22:49,718 --> 00:22:52,069
It was so freaking important.

521
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:56,290
Look at him. He looks...

522
00:22:58,845 --> 00:23:00,794
I don't care about
that crap anymore.

523
00:23:00,863 --> 00:23:02,796
And I don't need a stupid ring.

524
00:23:02,865 --> 00:23:06,133
I just... I just need him.

525
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:09,519
That's it. I just
want him to be okay.

526
00:23:10,573 --> 00:23:12,840
Please. Just let him be okay.

527
00:23:17,763 --> 00:23:19,046
Your incision looks good.

528
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,078
You should be back on
your feet in a few weeks,

529
00:23:23,102 --> 00:23:25,447
but I wouldn't recommend
pulling any more all-nighters,

530
00:23:25,471 --> 00:23:27,304
even on holidays like today.

531
00:23:27,373 --> 00:23:29,072
Trust me, brother. I'm done.

532
00:23:29,141 --> 00:23:31,242
I mean, what a stupid business.

533
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:32,576
People call you up, you know,

534
00:23:32,645 --> 00:23:34,512
they ask you to make
something beautiful.

535
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,680
Yeah, so some sorry
schlep can forget

536
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:39,349
that they've been treated like
crap every other day of the year.

537
00:23:40,903 --> 00:23:43,904
Yeah, like my flowers
are magic or something.

538
00:23:43,973 --> 00:23:45,806
But I bought it.

539
00:23:45,875 --> 00:23:47,741
Nearly killed myself
trying to make sure

540
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:49,676
everybody got
their little miracle.

541
00:23:49,745 --> 00:23:51,311
What a joke.

542
00:23:53,015 --> 00:23:54,626
People ought to just stop being

543
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:56,483
so awful to each
other, you know?

544
00:23:56,552 --> 00:23:58,218
Leave me out of it.

545
00:24:00,589 --> 00:24:01,699
Dr. Yang will
check on you later.

546
00:24:01,723 --> 00:24:02,756
Thank you.

547
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,727
Thank you.

548
00:24:08,247 --> 00:24:10,781
Can I just talk to
you for a minute?

549
00:24:15,521 --> 00:24:18,055
I know you've been through
hell, and I know I was part of it.

550
00:24:18,124 --> 00:24:20,090
And I know you're grieving,

551
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,092
and there's no magic
solution to that, but...

552
00:24:23,378 --> 00:24:26,546
We used to be
friends. And I really,

553
00:24:26,615 --> 00:24:27,814
really need a friend today.

554
00:24:30,052 --> 00:24:32,720
So how about we just go
across the street to Joe's,

555
00:24:32,788 --> 00:24:34,454
and I'll buy you a
drink, you know?

556
00:24:34,523 --> 00:24:37,725
Or I will buy you
many, many drinks.

557
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:40,294
Are you done?

558
00:24:40,363 --> 00:24:41,878
Are you finished?

559
00:24:41,947 --> 00:24:43,914
Yes. I hate you.

560
00:24:43,983 --> 00:24:46,495
From the moment you decided
to put the needs of your hospital

561
00:24:46,519 --> 00:24:48,780
over my dead husband,
I have hated you.

562
00:24:48,804 --> 00:24:50,815
I lie in bed at night alone,

563
00:24:50,839 --> 00:24:53,151
and I look at the spot where
my husband used to sleep,

564
00:24:53,175 --> 00:24:55,276
and I actively,

565
00:24:55,344 --> 00:24:58,879
with every cell in
my body, hate you.

566
00:24:58,948 --> 00:25:01,109
I wish you were
dead instead of him.

567
00:25:01,133 --> 00:25:04,213
I think about all the soldiers, good
men, who died over there in Iraq,

568
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:08,138
and I don't understand what kind
of God would allow you to survive.

569
00:25:08,207 --> 00:25:11,420
We are not friends. This
is not grief. It will not pass.

570
00:25:11,444 --> 00:25:13,510
I hate you!

571
00:25:13,579 --> 00:25:17,815
Please, don't speak to me
again unless it's work-related.

572
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:23,270
Let me get this straight.

573
00:25:23,338 --> 00:25:25,806
All right, you take this
thing out of her lungs,

574
00:25:25,875 --> 00:25:27,268
and it's not what
you thought it was.

575
00:25:27,292 --> 00:25:28,812
Now you want to
take out her ovaries.

576
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:30,438
The kind of
antibodies that she had

577
00:25:30,462 --> 00:25:34,331
are most commonly associated
with teratomas of the ovaries.

578
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,311
But they can sometimes
be found in other places,

579
00:25:36,335 --> 00:25:38,718
which is why we thought
the mass on her lung was it.

580
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:41,388
Chances are high
that it's on her ovaries.

581
00:25:41,457 --> 00:25:44,541
Chances are? That's
the best you can do?

582
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:45,658
She's young.

583
00:25:45,727 --> 00:25:47,293
She still wants kids. We...

584
00:25:49,181 --> 00:25:51,064
No. You're doctors.

585
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:53,884
You're gonna have to do a hell
of a lot better than "chances are."

586
00:25:53,953 --> 00:25:57,738
If we do nothing, she will
continue to have the seizures.

587
00:25:57,807 --> 00:26:00,585
And eventually, her body
will just completely shut down.

588
00:26:00,609 --> 00:26:03,905
And by that time, she will have
suffered so much brain damage

589
00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:07,097
that Janell, the woman
that you love, she'll be gone.

590
00:26:31,807 --> 00:26:33,551
The nougats are gone. Sorry.

591
00:26:33,575 --> 00:26:34,575
Aw.

592
00:26:36,078 --> 00:26:38,106
Did you get these
from a patient? No.

593
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:40,464
I bought these for Julia,

594
00:26:40,532 --> 00:26:43,878
but she's standing me up for an
emergency ocular transplant surgery,

595
00:26:43,902 --> 00:26:47,654
so I'm gorging myself
on Valentine's chocolate.

596
00:26:47,723 --> 00:26:51,708
Mmm. I'd mock you right
now if my mouth wasn't so full.

597
00:26:51,777 --> 00:26:53,727
Try the square ones.

598
00:26:53,795 --> 00:26:56,241
They're caramel
with sea salt. Mmm.

599
00:26:56,265 --> 00:26:58,705
I didn't want to disappoint her.

600
00:26:58,734 --> 00:27:01,584
You know, I bought
candy and flowers.

601
00:27:02,971 --> 00:27:05,539
I got rose petals, Lex.

602
00:27:05,608 --> 00:27:07,807
Bags of them.

603
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:09,996
I was looking
forward to sharing it.

604
00:27:11,364 --> 00:27:13,764
But now I'm alone
on Valentine's Day,

605
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:15,789
eating chocolate.

606
00:27:17,303 --> 00:27:18,885
I can do you one better.

607
00:27:18,954 --> 00:27:20,220
My hot date tonight?

608
00:27:20,989 --> 00:27:22,006
Zola.

609
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:24,708
I am babysitting.

610
00:27:27,329 --> 00:27:28,439
Let's move! He's coding!

611
00:27:28,463 --> 00:27:29,563
He's crashing.

612
00:27:29,631 --> 00:27:31,899
What is that? What's happening?

613
00:27:31,967 --> 00:27:33,567
What are you doing?

614
00:27:33,636 --> 00:27:35,613
Can someone please
tell me what is happening?

615
00:27:35,637 --> 00:27:37,232
Sharon... He was just
fine one second ago.

616
00:27:37,256 --> 00:27:38,733
No, you need to go.
Now! What's happening?

617
00:27:38,757 --> 00:27:40,685
- Somebody page Dr. Webber.
- Taking over compressions.

618
00:27:40,709 --> 00:27:42,604
He's in v-fib. LEXIE:
Push an amp of epi

619
00:27:42,628 --> 00:27:44,508
and charge the paddles to 360.

620
00:27:45,915 --> 00:27:46,991
Is it loaded?

621
00:27:47,015 --> 00:27:48,426
Yep, we're doing it. Okay.

622
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:49,483
Clear.

623
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:53,247
He's hemorrhaging.
Probably in DIC.

624
00:27:53,271 --> 00:27:55,089
Okay, charge again. Go.

625
00:27:55,157 --> 00:27:56,990
Hang some FFP at factor VII.

626
00:27:57,059 --> 00:27:58,075
Clear.

627
00:28:16,195 --> 00:28:17,844
Oh, God. No.

628
00:28:17,913 --> 00:28:19,090
I'm so sorry.

629
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:21,359
His heart stopped,
we tried to revive him,

630
00:28:21,383 --> 00:28:23,244
but despite our best
efforts, he didn't make it.

631
00:28:23,268 --> 00:28:24,296
He died at 7:53 p.m.

632
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:34,932
No indication of a tumor.

633
00:28:34,996 --> 00:28:36,863
It could be microscopic.

634
00:28:36,932 --> 00:28:39,933
There's a lot of adhesions on this
one, that could mean inflammation.

635
00:28:40,001 --> 00:28:42,730
Which could mean a teratoma.
So let's take out the right ovary,

636
00:28:42,754 --> 00:28:44,682
send it to path, and
try to save the left one.

637
00:28:44,706 --> 00:28:46,839
Dr. Grey, I'm the GYN.

638
00:28:46,908 --> 00:28:48,108
I really should be the one...

639
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:49,254
Okay, but you're a third year,

640
00:28:49,278 --> 00:28:51,678
and I can't trust
third-year hands.

641
00:28:51,746 --> 00:28:52,996
Boki, clamp.

642
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:54,872
I'm going with her.

643
00:28:56,919 --> 00:29:00,079
Ever thought you'd be
wishing so hard to find a tumor?

644
00:29:01,407 --> 00:29:02,773
No! No! No!

645
00:29:02,841 --> 00:29:04,173
Honey, we're leaving now.

646
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:06,577
No, I'm not! I promised
Clem I'd stay with her!

647
00:29:06,645 --> 00:29:09,780
Nico, don't make me pick
you up. You're too big for this.

648
00:29:09,848 --> 00:29:11,659
Come on. She's right, dude.

649
00:29:11,683 --> 00:29:13,195
This is embarrassing, you know?

650
00:29:13,219 --> 00:29:14,929
I'm a little
embarrassed for you.

651
00:29:14,953 --> 00:29:17,988
I don't care. What's Clem gonna
think if she wakes up and I'm gone?

652
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,480
She'll think that
I don't love her.

653
00:29:21,393 --> 00:29:23,193
Uh, look...

654
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:27,275
What if I'm there
when she wakes up?

655
00:29:27,299 --> 00:29:28,643
I'll tell her whatever you want.

656
00:29:28,667 --> 00:29:31,034
It's like the next best
thing to being there.

657
00:29:32,254 --> 00:29:33,319
Promise?

658
00:29:35,307 --> 00:29:36,540
Yeah.

659
00:29:39,527 --> 00:29:41,294
You're gonna need a
pen and a pad of paper.

660
00:29:53,075 --> 00:29:56,260
Oh, good. All right. Here
we go. Pathology's back.

661
00:29:56,328 --> 00:29:59,596
<i>The ovary specimen you sent
is normal. No pathology seen.</i>

662
00:29:59,664 --> 00:30:01,259
Damn. We picked the wrong ovary.

663
00:30:01,283 --> 00:30:03,717
There's a chance the
other one's clean, too.

664
00:30:03,785 --> 00:30:05,797
You don't have a very good
personality, you know that?

665
00:30:05,821 --> 00:30:08,054
The teratoma is
there. It has to be.

666
00:30:12,394 --> 00:30:15,434
Well, if not, we'll have just
sterilized a woman for no reason.

667
00:30:28,193 --> 00:30:31,027
I'm done. I am done with him.

668
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,630
Owen? Yeah.

669
00:30:35,501 --> 00:30:37,778
He actually thinks
that we can just forget

670
00:30:37,802 --> 00:30:38,946
everything that happened.

671
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:41,210
I don't even know how to...

672
00:30:42,141 --> 00:30:45,758
How can he think that we
would ever, ever be friends again?

673
00:30:57,189 --> 00:31:00,340
Standing over me is not gonna
make me read it any faster.

674
00:31:04,996 --> 00:31:06,974
This part of the specimen
is a little abnormal,

675
00:31:06,998 --> 00:31:08,943
but until I look at a
couple more slides...

676
00:31:08,967 --> 00:31:10,934
Move over. No.

677
00:31:11,003 --> 00:31:12,885
Move... Over.

678
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:14,254
Fine.

679
00:31:15,891 --> 00:31:17,957
Dr. Bailey, see what I see?

680
00:31:18,761 --> 00:31:20,794
I haven't confirmed it yet.

681
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:24,247
A mix of different cell types,
which is compatible with teratomas.

682
00:31:24,316 --> 00:31:26,616
Is that what you
see? Dr. Russell?

683
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:32,555
Okay, yes. I'd say it's
very likely a teratoma.

684
00:31:32,624 --> 00:31:34,104
Yes! Teratoma!

685
00:31:39,831 --> 00:31:41,297
Hey.

686
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:43,750
How you feeling?

687
00:31:43,819 --> 00:31:45,185
Okay.

688
00:31:45,253 --> 00:31:46,602
Yeah?

689
00:31:49,274 --> 00:31:51,107
Where's Nico?

690
00:31:51,176 --> 00:31:54,811
Well, he wanted to stay, but
you know, his mom made him go.

691
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:57,129
Figures.

692
00:31:57,198 --> 00:31:59,265
Yeah.

693
00:31:59,335 --> 00:32:02,352
But he told me a few
things he wanted to say.

694
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:03,787
But, well, here we go.

695
00:32:06,358 --> 00:32:07,958
"Dear Clementine,

696
00:32:08,026 --> 00:32:10,493
"I'm really sorry you're sick.

697
00:32:10,562 --> 00:32:12,895
"But I'm not sorry
you're my girlfriend.

698
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:17,600
"It's the worst, being
alone on Valentine's Day.

699
00:32:19,004 --> 00:32:21,087
"But I'm thinking
about you right now.

700
00:32:21,173 --> 00:32:23,106
"I'm thinking about
holding hands with you

701
00:32:23,175 --> 00:32:26,176
"and jumping on the
trampoline together.

702
00:32:26,245 --> 00:32:28,327
"I love you." Whoa.

703
00:32:28,864 --> 00:32:31,131
"And PS...

704
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,999
"I don't care who gave who lice,

705
00:32:33,068 --> 00:32:36,803
"I'm just glad we both
had it together. Love, Nico."

706
00:32:40,943 --> 00:32:42,942
I'd say you picked a good one.

707
00:33:38,316 --> 00:33:39,850
What should we do?

708
00:33:39,918 --> 00:33:41,852
You want to see
if the game's on?

709
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:48,725
I got steak and I
bought a really good red,

710
00:33:48,794 --> 00:33:51,077
and a salad, and I'm
gonna cook for you.

711
00:33:51,145 --> 00:33:52,195
Avery...

712
00:33:53,164 --> 00:33:55,131
I have a girlfriend.

713
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,611
And she's operating tonight, so
as soon as you put Sofia down,

714
00:33:57,635 --> 00:34:00,281
you can help me study for
my boards, 'cause I am behind.

715
00:34:00,305 --> 00:34:01,654
Way behind.

716
00:34:03,425 --> 00:34:04,802
What'd you pay for
that bottle of wine?

717
00:34:04,826 --> 00:34:06,142
50 bucks.

718
00:34:09,647 --> 00:34:11,414
I'm not great at surprises.

719
00:34:11,483 --> 00:34:14,084
I wish I was, but I
know we're camping.

720
00:34:14,152 --> 00:34:16,130
You know, I'm pretty sure that
we're smack-dab in the center

721
00:34:16,154 --> 00:34:18,088
of one of Washington's
fine national parks,

722
00:34:18,156 --> 00:34:20,090
and I'm trying to
have a good attitude,

723
00:34:20,158 --> 00:34:22,492
but this whole blind thing
is just not helping matters.

724
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,995
Wow. This is you
with a good attitude.

725
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:26,629
Fine. I'll shut up.

726
00:34:26,698 --> 00:34:28,131
Okay. Hey, are you peeking?

727
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,465
No! I'm not peeking.

728
00:34:29,534 --> 00:34:32,402
All right. Okay.
Okay. Are you ready?

729
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:33,982
Are you ready? Are you ready?

730
00:34:34,006 --> 00:34:35,055
Okay.

731
00:34:36,291 --> 00:34:37,531
Ta-da!

732
00:34:40,128 --> 00:34:41,827
Derek's trailer?

733
00:34:45,467 --> 00:34:49,085
I figured, he wasn't using
it, so I asked for the key.

734
00:34:50,021 --> 00:34:51,988
We really are camping.

735
00:34:53,125 --> 00:34:54,125
Whoo!

736
00:34:55,727 --> 00:34:57,894
Fun. Fun. Yes, fun.

737
00:34:57,963 --> 00:34:59,095
Yeah!

738
00:35:09,741 --> 00:35:11,475
We're not really camping.

739
00:35:11,543 --> 00:35:14,728
No. You hate camping.

740
00:35:14,813 --> 00:35:18,315
I do. I really do.

741
00:35:18,383 --> 00:35:20,433
I mean, it's almost
camping, only...

742
00:35:23,421 --> 00:35:25,087
There is a bed...

743
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:26,856
Oh.

744
00:35:26,924 --> 00:35:28,474
And lingerie.

745
00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:30,861
No one's around for miles.

746
00:35:43,608 --> 00:35:45,353
Our patient's seizures stopped,

747
00:35:45,377 --> 00:35:46,620
and you know why? No.

748
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:48,606
Because I found this
teratoma on her ovary.

749
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:50,307
Well, you know, you
could've told me this at dinner.

750
00:35:50,331 --> 00:35:52,282
You didn't have to show
me a chopped up ovary.

751
00:35:52,351 --> 00:35:54,628
Little sucker thought it could
hide from me, but it couldn't.

752
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:57,231
It took a while, but I finally
figured out where it was,

753
00:35:57,255 --> 00:35:58,804
and I went in and nailed it.

754
00:35:58,873 --> 00:36:01,041
You are so sexy when
you're looking at a teratoma.

755
00:36:11,703 --> 00:36:12,902
Yeah?

756
00:36:13,905 --> 00:36:15,271
Grade five?

757
00:36:17,041 --> 00:36:18,508
Ruptured?

758
00:36:21,446 --> 00:36:23,179
Yeah, send him over.

759
00:36:25,083 --> 00:36:26,883
Ugh!

760
00:36:26,951 --> 00:36:28,551
Blunt trauma to the kidney.

761
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:30,387
Guy crashed into a pole,

762
00:36:30,455 --> 00:36:33,022
not only shattering his
kidney and his renal artery,

763
00:36:33,091 --> 00:36:36,059
but ruining my Valentine's Day.

764
00:36:36,127 --> 00:36:37,287
Let me do it.

765
00:36:38,946 --> 00:36:40,647
Oh, no.

766
00:36:40,715 --> 00:36:44,567
Sir, I don't want to
ruin your night, too.

767
00:36:44,635 --> 00:36:47,620
Just go. Get home.
And it's your anniversary.

768
00:36:47,689 --> 00:36:50,990
For God sake. Adele's
probably so angry at you...

769
00:36:51,059 --> 00:36:53,226
I just went home.

770
00:36:53,295 --> 00:36:55,678
She didn't recognize me.

771
00:36:55,747 --> 00:36:58,765
She thought I
looked like a nice guy

772
00:36:58,833 --> 00:37:01,918
and invited me to
join her for dinner,

773
00:37:01,986 --> 00:37:04,387
flirted with me over steaks,

774
00:37:04,456 --> 00:37:06,556
thought I had a nice smile.

775
00:37:07,792 --> 00:37:09,759
So, no, Dr. Bailey,

776
00:37:09,827 --> 00:37:13,396
my wife's not mad right now.

777
00:37:13,465 --> 00:37:16,176
In fact, I think she's
falling in love with me.

778
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,400
Sir...

779
00:37:18,603 --> 00:37:19,903
I'm so sorry.

780
00:37:19,971 --> 00:37:21,270
Yeah, go. Go.

781
00:37:21,339 --> 00:37:24,790
I'd like to be alone right now
with a kidney and a scalpel.

782
00:37:24,859 --> 00:37:26,826
Go. Okay.

783
00:37:36,938 --> 00:37:40,123
I'm just gonna go. I'm gonna
go and I'm gonna tell him,

784
00:37:40,191 --> 00:37:42,792
and if there is a...

785
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:46,595
No, I'm not gonna tell him.
No, I'm gonna... Of course...

786
00:37:46,664 --> 00:37:48,542
Oh! Okay, of course.
No, I'm gonna tell him

787
00:37:48,566 --> 00:37:52,168
because if you don't say
anything, then you bleed out and die

788
00:37:52,237 --> 00:37:54,148
and you read about
it in a plastic locket.

789
00:37:54,172 --> 00:37:55,487
I mean, what do you think?

790
00:37:55,557 --> 00:37:57,157
What should I do?

791
00:37:57,225 --> 00:37:59,058
Zola? Well...

792
00:38:00,328 --> 00:38:01,728
Tell me.

793
00:38:04,182 --> 00:38:05,931
Look. Hey.

794
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,550
Look, look she's
up, she's eaten.

795
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:09,430
She's ready to roll. I'm
gonna take... So we just need...

796
00:38:09,454 --> 00:38:11,049
No, I'm gonna take off.
Yeah, take her with you.

797
00:38:11,073 --> 00:38:12,116
Drive her around.
She loves that.

798
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:13,539
No, what? What?

799
00:38:13,608 --> 00:38:15,285
Zola, we'll be back.

800
00:38:20,065 --> 00:38:22,631
Okay, I'm still in
my scrubs. I know.

801
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:24,929
I'm sorry. I had a surgery
and then another one came in,

802
00:38:24,953 --> 00:38:26,914
and I know it seems
like I blew you off,

803
00:38:26,938 --> 00:38:28,816
but I didn't. We
can still go to dinner.

804
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:33,009
Dinner is over. It's 11:23 p.m.

805
00:38:33,077 --> 00:38:34,727
You blew me off
for dinner hours ago.

806
00:38:34,796 --> 00:38:35,973
I ruined our Valentine's Day?

807
00:38:35,997 --> 00:38:37,096
Miranda, I...

808
00:38:37,165 --> 00:38:38,564
I'm a terrible person.

809
00:38:38,633 --> 00:38:41,868
I know. I don't make
time like I should.

810
00:38:41,936 --> 00:38:46,222
I'm not good at
romance-y things,

811
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:49,053
but, look, I am working,
and you can't fault me for that.

812
00:38:49,077 --> 00:38:50,788
You can't fault
me for saving lives.

813
00:38:50,812 --> 00:38:53,257
And if you're going
to break up with me

814
00:38:53,281 --> 00:38:55,441
for missing a dinner
because I was saving a life,

815
00:38:55,483 --> 00:38:58,784
then I don't even want to
have romance-y things with you.

816
00:38:58,853 --> 00:39:00,597
Okay, Miranda. Wait.
Why are you in a suit?

817
00:39:00,621 --> 00:39:03,372
Because it's 11:23 p.m.

818
00:39:03,441 --> 00:39:04,924
Valentine's Day isn't over yet.

819
00:39:16,805 --> 00:39:19,005
You threw this together today?

820
00:39:19,073 --> 00:39:22,074
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no.
I've been planning this for weeks.

821
00:39:22,143 --> 00:39:23,776
See, I knew there
was no chance in hell

822
00:39:23,845 --> 00:39:25,744
that we'd make a
scheduled reservation,

823
00:39:25,814 --> 00:39:28,247
so I booked Marco here.

824
00:39:28,316 --> 00:39:30,783
I mean, I'm dating Dr. Bailey.

825
00:39:30,852 --> 00:39:32,418
I know the drill.

826
00:39:34,772 --> 00:39:36,455
I know you.

827
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:40,443
You know me.

828
00:39:45,232 --> 00:39:47,333
And I even had Marco put

829
00:39:47,401 --> 00:39:49,669
extra crumb topping
on your mac and cheese.

830
00:39:51,623 --> 00:39:52,722
I know you.

831
00:39:52,791 --> 00:39:53,857
Okay.

832
00:39:54,826 --> 00:39:55,975
Thank you, sir.

833
00:39:57,645 --> 00:39:59,045
Miranda,

834
00:40:00,615 --> 00:40:05,334
I happen to be very
good at romance-y things.

835
00:40:06,638 --> 00:40:09,873
Yeah. You are.

836
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:18,347
<i>We're always looking
for ways to ease the pain.</i>

837
00:40:20,518 --> 00:40:22,017
Hey.

838
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:25,037
I thought maybe the girls
could have a play date.

839
00:40:25,106 --> 00:40:29,809
And we could talk about stuff,

840
00:40:29,878 --> 00:40:33,646
'cause there's some stuff
that I've been wanting to say.

841
00:40:36,017 --> 00:40:38,718
Oh. Is that Julia? I'll go.

842
00:40:38,786 --> 00:40:40,026
Avery's cooking me dinner.

843
00:40:40,054 --> 00:40:41,899
Is that Julia? 'Cause I can go.

844
00:40:41,923 --> 00:40:43,823
Oh. That's...

845
00:40:43,891 --> 00:40:45,131
But he can go...

846
00:40:45,176 --> 00:40:46,943
If you want to talk.

847
00:40:48,179 --> 00:40:49,579
Should he go?

848
00:40:49,648 --> 00:40:50,796
Hey.

849
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:55,668
Nope. It's nothing. I... It's...

850
00:40:55,736 --> 00:40:59,038
You know what? You two
have a very pleasant evening.

851
00:40:59,107 --> 00:41:00,751
Don't be stupid. You love steak.

852
00:41:00,775 --> 00:41:03,342
Sofia, your friend's here.

853
00:41:03,411 --> 00:41:04,855
<i>Sometimes we ease the pain</i>

854
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:07,613
<i>by making the best
of what we have.</i>

855
00:41:11,753 --> 00:41:14,593
<i>Sometimes it's by losing
ourselves in the moment.</i>

856
00:41:36,161 --> 00:41:37,360
Please.

857
00:41:39,631 --> 00:41:40,980
Don't hate me.

858
00:41:45,853 --> 00:41:48,003
I'm begging you.

859
00:41:51,259 --> 00:41:54,627
<i>And sometimes all we
need to do to ease the pain</i>

860
00:42:04,022 --> 00:42:05,955
<i>is call a simple truce.</i>
