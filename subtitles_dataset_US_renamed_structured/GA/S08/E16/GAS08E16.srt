1
00:00:12,746 --> 00:00:15,697
<i>As surgeons, we're trained
to consult with each other,</i>

2
00:00:18,702 --> 00:00:20,668
<i>to get opposing views.</i>

3
00:00:20,737 --> 00:00:22,787
Non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema.

4
00:00:23,657 --> 00:00:24,801
Aortic pulmonary dissection.

5
00:00:24,825 --> 00:00:27,359
Yes! No. Wait,
no. That's not right.

6
00:00:27,427 --> 00:00:28,710
Well, what I'm saying is,

7
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:31,029
I finally understand
the complexities

8
00:00:31,098 --> 00:00:33,315
of post-obstructive
pulmonary edema.

9
00:00:33,383 --> 00:00:34,950
Uh-huh.

10
00:00:35,019 --> 00:00:37,569
<i>We even encourage patients
to seek second opinions.</i>

11
00:00:37,638 --> 00:00:40,639
Because I've been
up since 4:00 a.m.,

12
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:41,951
studying for the
boards with Callie.

13
00:00:41,975 --> 00:00:43,275
Since 4:00 a.m.

14
00:00:43,344 --> 00:00:45,489
I haven't seen my husband
or my baby since yesterday.

15
00:00:45,513 --> 00:00:48,479
I don't even care, because
Callie blew my mind.

16
00:00:48,532 --> 00:00:49,964
She blew my mind.

17
00:00:50,051 --> 00:00:51,250
My hair is on fire.

18
00:00:51,318 --> 00:00:54,052
I mean, literal flames
shooting out of my head.

19
00:00:54,121 --> 00:00:56,622
Mmm-hmm. Yeah. That's really...

20
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:58,602
Whatever. You know what?
I'm gonna catch up with you later.

21
00:00:58,626 --> 00:00:59,975
I mean, she's that good.

22
00:01:00,043 --> 00:01:02,043
I am gonna kill the boards.

23
00:01:02,112 --> 00:01:03,912
I am gonna make
the boards my bitch.

24
00:01:03,981 --> 00:01:05,124
Yeah, boards, bitch,
got it. Because I...

25
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:06,943
Ow!

26
00:01:06,967 --> 00:01:09,034
What are we doing? Nothing.

27
00:01:09,103 --> 00:01:11,981
<i>But why seek a second opinion
when you know that you're right?</i>

28
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:13,649
You look weird. Why
do you look so weird?

29
00:01:13,673 --> 00:01:16,525
I do not look weird. You were...

30
00:01:16,593 --> 00:01:17,942
Talking about...

31
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:19,188
Uh, the boards.

32
00:01:19,212 --> 00:01:20,690
I was talking about
what a good teacher

33
00:01:20,714 --> 00:01:22,108
Callie is, and you
weren't listening.

34
00:01:22,132 --> 00:01:24,583
No, I was listening.
What did I say?

35
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:26,702
<i>'Cause if we're
honest with ourselves...</i>

36
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:28,002
Cristina?

37
00:01:28,071 --> 00:01:29,955
<i>Surgeons are more like cowboys.</i>

38
00:01:30,023 --> 00:01:33,291
Your hair is fire,
Callie is that good,

39
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,600
the boards are your bitch.

40
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:39,030
I gotta go.

41
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:41,019
<i>We're more likely
to go it alone.</i>

42
00:01:41,067 --> 00:01:42,501
The boards are my bitch.

43
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:45,270
Hey. Guess what.

44
00:01:45,339 --> 00:01:47,673
I'm on Peds today. Babies. Yay.

45
00:01:47,741 --> 00:01:50,575
The NICU, not the nursery.
It can get pretty intense.

46
00:01:50,644 --> 00:01:52,177
Oh, well, nothing is as intense

47
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:53,745
as working on
Derek's lost causes.

48
00:01:53,814 --> 00:01:55,213
It's like a death
march up there.

49
00:01:55,265 --> 00:01:57,265
I mean, I call time of
death on a daily basis.

50
00:01:57,333 --> 00:01:59,017
What do we got today?

51
00:01:59,086 --> 00:02:02,165
Well, you ever seen a baby
that weighs less than a pound?

52
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:05,440
Uh, no, because babies that
weigh less than 16 ounces

53
00:02:08,395 --> 00:02:09,661
don't survive.

54
00:02:19,807 --> 00:02:20,866
My God.

55
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,974
He's the size of a soda can.

56
00:02:23,043 --> 00:02:24,142
14 ounces.

57
00:02:24,912 --> 00:02:26,152
But he's growing.

58
00:02:27,414 --> 00:02:29,381
That might just be
bloating from the fluids.

59
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:31,182
Well, let's take a look.

60
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:32,317
How you feeling, Morgan?

61
00:02:32,386 --> 00:02:34,752
I'm the least of my worries.

62
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:37,617
You must be Chris. Cardio
resident at Cleveland, right?

63
00:02:37,641 --> 00:02:38,701
You talk about me?

64
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:40,008
You don't talk about me?

65
00:02:40,678 --> 00:02:42,177
Oh...

66
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:44,685
You guys haven't had any
time to pick out a name yet, huh?

67
00:02:44,814 --> 00:02:45,881
No, we, uh...

68
00:02:45,949 --> 00:02:47,949
Yeah, we should do that.

69
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:49,901
Any thoughts?

70
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:51,631
We probably should wait a
few weeks, don't you think,

71
00:02:51,655 --> 00:02:54,222
until he can see and hear
and breathe on his own?

72
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:56,625
14.3 ounces today.

73
00:02:56,693 --> 00:02:58,276
I told you he was bigger.

74
00:02:58,345 --> 00:03:00,665
Let's see how that changes
his outcome predictor.

75
00:03:01,364 --> 00:03:02,431
Outcome predictor?

76
00:03:02,499 --> 00:03:04,599
Yeah, it's a formula
for micro preemies

77
00:03:04,668 --> 00:03:06,468
that determines their
chances of survival.

78
00:03:06,553 --> 00:03:08,114
We don't use it here. Why?

79
00:03:09,205 --> 00:03:10,304
Nope.

80
00:03:10,373 --> 00:03:13,258
Chance of survival,
still a whopping 13%.

81
00:03:15,062 --> 00:03:17,145
That's why. It
freaks parents out.

82
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:19,615
Morning.

83
00:03:19,683 --> 00:03:22,684
Dr. Robbins, 14.3 today.

84
00:03:22,753 --> 00:03:24,798
Well, at least that's
headed in the right direction.

85
00:03:24,822 --> 00:03:27,155
On the other hand,
we got the x-rays back,

86
00:03:27,224 --> 00:03:28,824
and he's developed NEC.

87
00:03:28,892 --> 00:03:30,720
His bowels are rotting, and
unless we get in there and fix it...

88
00:03:30,744 --> 00:03:32,789
The mortality
rate of that surgery

89
00:03:32,813 --> 00:03:34,858
is over 50% in a
preemie this size.

90
00:03:34,882 --> 00:03:38,061
Survival rate for treating NEC
surgically has gotten way better.

91
00:03:38,085 --> 00:03:39,684
Guys, hold on. Listen,

92
00:03:39,753 --> 00:03:42,404
you've got plenty of decisions to
debate down the line, too many.

93
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:43,938
All right? This
one's a no-brainer.

94
00:03:44,007 --> 00:03:46,047
You don't operate, he's
gonna die. Simple as that.

95
00:03:47,077 --> 00:03:48,277
Dr. Karev is right.

96
00:03:51,831 --> 00:03:53,765
Well, I guess we have no choice.

97
00:03:57,821 --> 00:03:59,921
I will see you at
lunch, all right?

98
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:03,058
Oh, Dr. Bailey, is the dumbbell
tumor still on the books?

99
00:04:03,127 --> 00:04:04,676
Yes, all good to...

100
00:04:08,515 --> 00:04:10,555
Is Meredith out sick today or...

101
00:04:10,601 --> 00:04:13,935
She came in early to
study with Torres. Why?

102
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:17,121
Um, no, no reason. It's
just that she usually...

103
00:04:18,509 --> 00:04:21,393
Drops Zola off. So...

104
00:04:24,798 --> 00:04:26,131
Um, I'll see you up there.

105
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:27,265
Okay.

106
00:04:32,506 --> 00:04:34,105
Say good-bye...

107
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:38,977
So if you could take a
look again at chart 9C,

108
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:41,845
you will see the
potential effect that, uh...

109
00:04:42,816 --> 00:04:44,766
I'm sorry. It's not 9C.

110
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:46,218
Um...

111
00:04:47,021 --> 00:04:48,787
Where is it?

112
00:04:51,108 --> 00:04:52,390
Anyway, um...

113
00:04:53,443 --> 00:04:56,077
As you can see...

114
00:04:56,146 --> 00:04:57,345
It's really cool.

115
00:04:57,414 --> 00:05:01,566
I just need a minute to find it.

116
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:05,036
I have 3-D models of stem cells,

117
00:05:05,105 --> 00:05:09,941
so you can see them working
together to grow a heart.

118
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:11,470
I just need a second to find it.

119
00:05:11,494 --> 00:05:12,761
No problem.

120
00:05:20,437 --> 00:05:23,771
Dr. Altman, we have your material.
It should be enough to go on.

121
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,174
Oh, okay. Well, um...

122
00:05:27,311 --> 00:05:29,827
Just please remember
that this research can save

123
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:31,980
tens of thousands of lives,

124
00:05:32,049 --> 00:05:33,248
so...

125
00:05:35,618 --> 00:05:37,252
Please consider it carefully.

126
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:46,595
What do we got?

127
00:05:46,663 --> 00:05:48,625
Espresso machine exploded
at a coffeehouse on Roosevelt.

128
00:05:48,649 --> 00:05:50,893
Got a 24-year-old female
with second-degree burns

129
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:52,095
on her chest, neck, and face.

130
00:05:52,119 --> 00:05:53,501
Oh, God. Is my face melted?

131
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:55,448
Is that a large-bore
IV? IV's in the left arm.

132
00:05:55,472 --> 00:05:57,633
That's not what I asked you. You
should've put in a large-bore IV.

133
00:05:57,657 --> 00:05:58,868
It's a 20 gauge.
Do you want me to...

134
00:05:58,892 --> 00:06:00,732
I'll do it myself since
I want it done right.

135
00:06:00,877 --> 00:06:01,921
What's your name?

136
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:03,445
Angie. Is my face melted?

137
00:06:03,513 --> 00:06:05,731
No, Angie. Try and
relax. Get a burn kit.

138
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:08,078
Thirty-seven-year-old
male, hypotensive in the field,

139
00:06:08,102 --> 00:06:09,784
resolved with fluids.

140
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,964
Open proximal humerus fracture
and multiple lacerations and abrasions.

141
00:06:11,988 --> 00:06:13,449
An espresso machine did this?

142
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:15,084
Blew him clear across the
shop and into some shelves.

143
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:16,769
And the parts that didn't
hit him went through the wall

144
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:18,793
and into the next store.

145
00:06:18,862 --> 00:06:21,413
Okay, let's page
Dr. Torres and Dr. Hunt.

146
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:24,010
All right. He's got shrapnel in
his chest. Let's page Cardio.

147
00:06:24,034 --> 00:06:25,083
Mmm-hmm.

148
00:06:25,152 --> 00:06:26,968
Angie. Is Angie okay?

149
00:06:27,036 --> 00:06:29,036
Who's Angie? Is that your wife?

150
00:06:29,272 --> 00:06:30,522
My barista.

151
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,079
Adele?

152
00:07:12,716 --> 00:07:13,748
Adele!

153
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:16,601
Oh, God.

154
00:07:26,229 --> 00:07:27,962
Oh.

155
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:29,114
Adele.

156
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:30,532
Are you okay, honey?

157
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:32,934
Oh.

158
00:07:51,772 --> 00:07:52,904
It was a fiasco.

159
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:54,050
Oh, it couldn't
have been that bad.

160
00:07:54,074 --> 00:07:56,174
It was precisely that bad.

161
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:58,755
No, but it's stem cells. It's the
future. I mean, they know that.

162
00:07:58,779 --> 00:08:01,507
No, it's dead, just like my
husband, who is also dead.

163
00:08:01,531 --> 00:08:02,826
There's a theme
here. Are you noticing?

164
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:04,493
Teddy... Whatever. I don't care.

165
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:05,645
The nice part about
having a dead husband

166
00:08:05,669 --> 00:08:07,229
is that you stop caring
about anything at all.

167
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:08,848
You should ask Owen
to put in a good word.

168
00:08:08,872 --> 00:08:11,639
The Chief of Surgery can have
a lot of pull in these decisions.

169
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:13,074
I don't talk to Owen Hunt.

170
00:08:16,546 --> 00:08:18,291
Out of the way, Grey.
I need to get in there.

171
00:08:18,315 --> 00:08:20,493
We've got a white out on
the right. Yang, chest tube.

172
00:08:20,517 --> 00:08:21,532
Sure.

173
00:08:23,953 --> 00:08:25,513
Rough night last night? Hmm?

174
00:08:26,323 --> 00:08:27,756
You didn't come home.

175
00:08:27,824 --> 00:08:31,392
Oh, yeah. MVC. I texted, but
you must have been asleep.

176
00:08:31,461 --> 00:08:34,206
Okay, Devin, we are gonna
give you some pain meds.

177
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:36,876
And we're gonna put a tube in
your chest that will drain the blood,

178
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,780
and you will start
to feel a lot better.

179
00:08:39,553 --> 00:08:41,052
I just ran into Teddy.

180
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,565
She said that she blew her
pitch to the board this morning.

181
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:44,789
It might be nice if you
backed her up, you know?

182
00:08:44,841 --> 00:08:46,107
Put in a good word.

183
00:08:46,176 --> 00:08:48,004
Pulse is faint on the
left. I need a CT angio.

184
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:50,473
Okay, Devin, once we get this
tube in, we're gonna take you to CT.

185
00:08:50,497 --> 00:08:52,091
Do you have any family
we need to contact?

186
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:54,449
My parents are old. I
don't want to worry them.

187
00:08:54,517 --> 00:08:57,002
If you could just let
Angie know I'm okay.

188
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:58,070
She's probably worried.

189
00:08:58,137 --> 00:08:59,137
I'm sorry. Who's Angie?

190
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:01,365
Uh, the burned
barista in trauma one.

191
00:09:01,391 --> 00:09:03,441
Dr. Grey,
Dr. Webber's in the ER.

192
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:05,470
Yeah? No, he's in the ER.

193
00:09:10,183 --> 00:09:12,350
I checked the
over-pressure valve.

194
00:09:12,419 --> 00:09:14,219
It was fine.

195
00:09:14,288 --> 00:09:15,503
Or was that yesterday?

196
00:09:15,571 --> 00:09:17,733
Oh, God, is this my fault?
Did I melt my own face off?

197
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:20,458
Nothing's been melted
off. Try to stay still, please.

198
00:09:20,527 --> 00:09:22,505
I mean, they can't expect
me to monitor the machine

199
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:23,589
and handle the
morning rush, right?

200
00:09:23,613 --> 00:09:25,007
I really need you to stay still.

201
00:09:25,031 --> 00:09:26,392
I mean, it's too much
pressure, this job.

202
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:28,310
Not enough pay and
way too much pressure.

203
00:09:28,334 --> 00:09:29,645
I mean, you guys have no idea.

204
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:31,497
We're fixing your
face. That is pressure.

205
00:09:31,521 --> 00:09:32,832
Now if you could do
us both a favor and...

206
00:09:32,856 --> 00:09:35,273
Dr. Avery, go get us
some more bandages.

207
00:09:35,976 --> 00:09:37,025
Now.

208
00:09:42,382 --> 00:09:44,115
Sorry about that.

209
00:09:44,184 --> 00:09:46,367
Continue to clean here.
I'll be back in a second.

210
00:09:46,436 --> 00:09:47,551
Okay, Doctor.

211
00:09:48,689 --> 00:09:50,722
You yelled at a patient
and a paramedic,

212
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:53,791
two people you do not want to
piss off. What's your problem?

213
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,393
I'm sorry, all right?

214
00:09:55,462 --> 00:09:56,573
I've just been so tense.
I'm studying for the boards.

215
00:09:56,597 --> 00:09:58,846
We've been
studying. You'll do fine.

216
00:09:58,915 --> 00:10:02,275
I can't do fine. I have
to do great. I'm an Avery.

217
00:10:02,336 --> 00:10:03,685
Are you getting any?

218
00:10:03,753 --> 00:10:05,181
Did you just ask
me if I'm getting any?

219
00:10:05,205 --> 00:10:06,549
When was the last time?
That's none of your business.

220
00:10:06,573 --> 00:10:08,272
Just tell me. I won't judge.

221
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:10,701
I am focused. There's no time.

222
00:10:11,078 --> 00:10:13,495
There's always time.

223
00:10:13,563 --> 00:10:16,141
My mother used to have
trouble with the stove, too,

224
00:10:16,165 --> 00:10:17,994
and then she started
getting lost driving,

225
00:10:18,018 --> 00:10:21,135
and then she started leaving the
house in the middle of the night.

226
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:24,605
Adele's fine. And
we're managing.

227
00:10:24,674 --> 00:10:28,309
Rose Ridge is top-notch,
great doctors, great facility.

228
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:32,446
Yeah, I know, I know.
We're just not there yet.

229
00:10:32,515 --> 00:10:35,294
Any deeper, and this burn
could've retired you from surgery.

230
00:10:35,318 --> 00:10:36,817
Yeah, I'll look into it.

231
00:10:36,887 --> 00:10:38,297
You're just trying
to shut me up.

232
00:10:38,321 --> 00:10:40,187
Yeah, how am I doing?

233
00:10:40,257 --> 00:10:42,735
I don't have pull many places,
but I'm kind of a big deal there.

234
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:46,279
So if you need me to
make a call for you, I can.

235
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:50,726
Good. Only a little of
the bowel is necrotic.

236
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,628
There should be more
than enough to salvage.

237
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,163
Maybe his dad
should factor spunk

238
00:10:54,187 --> 00:10:56,036
into his stupid algorithm.

239
00:10:56,106 --> 00:10:57,717
He's a fourth year. He knows
just enough to be annoying.

240
00:10:57,741 --> 00:11:00,101
Well, he's acting like
the baby is already dead.

241
00:11:00,143 --> 00:11:02,226
But look at him. He's a champ.

242
00:11:02,295 --> 00:11:04,655
You're like a little
Muhammad Ali, aren't you?

243
00:11:04,714 --> 00:11:06,314
Someone's peppy.

244
00:11:06,383 --> 00:11:08,927
She's on a vacation from
lost-cause brain surgeries.

245
00:11:08,951 --> 00:11:10,279
She needs to have
some fun today.

246
00:11:10,303 --> 00:11:11,602
You know what's really fun?

247
00:11:11,672 --> 00:11:13,953
Removing dead bowel.
You want to make the cut?

248
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,690
Really? Are you sure?

249
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:17,919
Yeah. Get over there
before I change my mind.

250
00:11:21,297 --> 00:11:23,231
Okay, the tissue
rips really easily,

251
00:11:23,299 --> 00:11:26,899
so only press down as hard
as you would need to cut a hair.

252
00:11:30,323 --> 00:11:33,436
So Torres and I assessed his
shoulder, and I mean... Wow.

253
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,642
So we both agreed...

254
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:36,611
Yeah, let's just do this. Sir.

255
00:11:36,697 --> 00:11:39,297
We're gonna take a scan
of your chest and your arms.

256
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:40,699
So just try and relax.

257
00:11:40,767 --> 00:11:43,068
My friend Angie, is she okay?

258
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,030
She's got some bad
burns, but she'll be fine.

259
00:11:45,054 --> 00:11:47,555
It's my fault for going
in during the rush.

260
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:49,224
She gets too
flustered around me.

261
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:51,692
And the sexual tension's
been building for months...

262
00:11:51,761 --> 00:11:54,662
You know, a look
here, a smile there.

263
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:58,532
It can be hard to focus with all those
pheromones buzzing around you.

264
00:11:58,601 --> 00:12:00,335
I should've known it's
become dangerous.

265
00:12:00,403 --> 00:12:02,314
Okay, well, let's get you and
your pheromones into the scan.

266
00:12:02,338 --> 00:12:05,356
Yeah, lately, she's been
taking it to another level,

267
00:12:05,424 --> 00:12:08,810
adding these foam leaf
designs on top of my coffee...

268
00:12:08,878 --> 00:12:10,728
Handmade, just for me.

269
00:12:10,797 --> 00:12:14,532
It'd be great if I could send
Angie a cappuccino or something.

270
00:12:14,601 --> 00:12:15,967
Let her know I'm doing okay.

271
00:12:23,025 --> 00:12:24,291
Nicely done.

272
00:12:26,813 --> 00:12:27,979
So now what?

273
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:29,280
Even if he stabilizes,

274
00:12:29,348 --> 00:12:31,599
he's looking at years of
procedures and surgeries.

275
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:33,001
His parents are residents.

276
00:12:33,069 --> 00:12:34,669
They can't both
quit, and medical care

277
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:36,395
for a little guy like
this is expensive.

278
00:12:36,456 --> 00:12:39,056
You really know how to take the
fun out of a party, you know that?

279
00:12:40,276 --> 00:12:41,837
Damn. Looks like he's
in cardiogenic shock.

280
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:43,494
Push epi and atropine.

281
00:12:43,563 --> 00:12:45,363
Did I...

282
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:47,193
No, no, no, no. You did
just fine. It's just that...

283
00:12:47,217 --> 00:12:48,349
He's brady'ed down to 52.

284
00:12:48,418 --> 00:12:49,784
Grey, start CPR.

285
00:12:49,853 --> 00:12:51,235
His heart hasn't stopped.

286
00:12:51,304 --> 00:12:53,515
With preemies, we start CPR
when the heart rate goes below 60.

287
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:55,899
Now use two fingers,
light pressure. Go.

288
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:06,234
We get seven major
newspapers here every day,

289
00:13:06,302 --> 00:13:08,686
as well as live readings
from local authors.

290
00:13:08,755 --> 00:13:10,766
Oh, look, Adele,
a mystery section.

291
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,385
She loves mysteries,
don't you, honey?

292
00:13:12,409 --> 00:13:14,942
Our librarian reads a
chapter every day after dinner.

293
00:13:15,011 --> 00:13:16,956
Actually, we're just
finishing <i>Death on the Nile,</i>

294
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:19,058
so if you know who done
it, keep it to yourselves.

295
00:13:21,918 --> 00:13:23,762
Should we check
out the gymnasium?

296
00:13:23,786 --> 00:13:26,106
We just added a piloxing class.

297
00:13:37,784 --> 00:13:39,383
Every room is different,

298
00:13:39,452 --> 00:13:41,630
but they all have their own
instant call button for attendants,

299
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:44,622
your own bathroom, and
a nice view of the grounds.

300
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:47,002
I'll leave you two alone, so you
can look the place over on your own.

301
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:49,186
If you have any questions,
I'll be at the front desk.

302
00:14:00,807 --> 00:14:02,047
What do you think, Adele?

303
00:14:02,993 --> 00:14:04,108
It's nice.

304
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:07,779
But it's too small for us.

305
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:11,215
You're a doctor. You said
that you could afford a house.

306
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:14,519
We certainly couldn't
possibly start a family here.

307
00:14:15,121 --> 00:14:16,721
Richard...

308
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:18,923
Where would the nursery go?

309
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:25,770
You're right, honey.

310
00:14:27,234 --> 00:14:28,316
It's too small.

311
00:14:29,853 --> 00:14:31,953
I said I'd get you a house.

312
00:14:33,823 --> 00:14:34,956
Let's go.

313
00:14:42,849 --> 00:14:44,449
I got it.

314
00:14:44,517 --> 00:14:45,745
Got what? The grant.

315
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:49,003
Four million to grow
hearts from stem cells.

316
00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:50,171
You got it?

317
00:14:50,239 --> 00:14:52,517
I'm gonna grow hearts.
Can you believe it?

318
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:54,592
Oh, God, Teddy, that's amazing.

319
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,922
I must have not done as
bad as I thought this morning

320
00:14:56,946 --> 00:14:59,292
unless... Or I charmed them
with my fumbling desperation.

321
00:14:59,316 --> 00:15:01,482
I have no idea. I
don't care. I got it.

322
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:05,597
We were able to cut out
most of the necrotic bowel,

323
00:15:05,621 --> 00:15:07,855
but then he went into CHF.

324
00:15:07,924 --> 00:15:09,457
Oh, my God.

325
00:15:09,526 --> 00:15:12,059
Morgan, he's 24 weeks old.

326
00:15:12,128 --> 00:15:13,444
Born 16 weeks early.

327
00:15:13,512 --> 00:15:15,363
This shouldn't be a
shock. He wasn't ready.

328
00:15:15,432 --> 00:15:17,598
But there are a few
things that we can try

329
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:19,127
to help oxygenate him better.

330
00:15:19,151 --> 00:15:20,596
And then hopefully,
he'll get stronger.

331
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,497
We could use liquid ventilation.

332
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:24,071
Which could cause hypocarbia.

333
00:15:24,139 --> 00:15:26,351
We could put him on a
high-frequency oscillator.

334
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:27,658
Which could cause air trapping.

335
00:15:27,726 --> 00:15:29,343
Or we can put him on ECMO.

336
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:31,274
Which, just to get
ahead of you, Chris,

337
00:15:31,298 --> 00:15:32,958
we don't think he would
survive at this stage.

338
00:15:32,982 --> 00:15:35,366
Okay, but before we do anything,

339
00:15:35,418 --> 00:15:37,162
we just need to know how
aggressive you want to be.

340
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:39,954
I think we stop.
We stop right now.

341
00:15:43,292 --> 00:15:46,159
There are plenty
of options. We...

342
00:15:46,228 --> 00:15:47,945
We should use them.

343
00:15:48,014 --> 00:15:50,531
These are his chances
of survival right here.

344
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,816
This is reality.

345
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:53,684
Now you're a
doctor. Think like one.

346
00:15:53,753 --> 00:15:56,193
If you had a patient with odds
like that, would you operate?

347
00:16:00,609 --> 00:16:02,876
I'm sorry about
earlier. The way I...

348
00:16:02,945 --> 00:16:05,040
My behavior was
completely unprofessional.

349
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:06,581
No, I'm sorry.

350
00:16:06,649 --> 00:16:07,759
I was freaking out.

351
00:16:07,783 --> 00:16:09,850
Look at you two, getting along.

352
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:11,385
You date doctors, Angie?

353
00:16:11,454 --> 00:16:13,532
Do not listen to this man.
He thinks I need to be set up.

354
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:17,841
He does need to be set up.
He's shy, needs a little push.

355
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,205
Devin is heading into surgery.

356
00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:20,339
He wanted me to give you this,

357
00:16:20,363 --> 00:16:21,573
tell you not to worry, etcetera.

358
00:16:21,597 --> 00:16:22,763
So, here.

359
00:16:22,832 --> 00:16:23,864
Devin?

360
00:16:23,933 --> 00:16:25,482
The guy from the accident.

361
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:27,017
Okay. I...

362
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:29,754
You know, the customer
you flirt with every day?

363
00:16:29,823 --> 00:16:31,822
I'm sorry. I have
no idea who he is.

364
00:16:31,891 --> 00:16:33,157
Sweet, nerdy type.

365
00:16:33,226 --> 00:16:37,361
You put those foamy leaves
on the top of his coffee?

366
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:39,429
I have to make those
leaves for everybody.

367
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:41,132
It's a new company policy.

368
00:16:42,685 --> 00:16:43,800
I'll take it.

369
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:45,769
Get your own.

370
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:51,275
That's not my point.

371
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:52,988
I can't believe that they're
not gonna do anything.

372
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:56,414
I mean, they are basically
giving this kid a death sentence.

373
00:16:56,483 --> 00:16:58,549
Chris just wants to get
back to his residency,

374
00:16:58,618 --> 00:17:00,879
and Morgan is too weak
to even think straight.

375
00:17:00,903 --> 00:17:02,147
The parents have
made up their minds.

376
00:17:02,171 --> 00:17:04,004
Just let me eat
my food in peace.

377
00:17:04,073 --> 00:17:05,817
Ali doesn't even have any
parents, as far as I can see.

378
00:17:05,841 --> 00:17:07,903
And you know what?
She is your intern.

379
00:17:07,927 --> 00:17:09,427
You need to step up.

380
00:17:09,479 --> 00:17:10,772
Give me those.
She won't shut up.

381
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:12,146
No, I'm studying.

382
00:17:12,232 --> 00:17:13,709
Okay, look, all I am saying...

383
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:14,765
Look, let it go, Lexie.

384
00:17:14,834 --> 00:17:16,350
All I am saying is,

385
00:17:16,419 --> 00:17:19,120
parents did not decide
his treatment plan,

386
00:17:19,188 --> 00:17:21,489
doctors did. Math did.

387
00:17:26,429 --> 00:17:27,611
Get your own.

388
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,920
Hey, so it turns out Devin
needs a thoracotomy.

389
00:17:31,484 --> 00:17:32,550
Your surgery.

390
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:35,753
Remember Devin,

391
00:17:35,822 --> 00:17:37,702
likes coffee, is in
love with his barista?

392
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:41,615
What about me? Remember me?

393
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,194
Hey, um...

394
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:44,762
Have you hit that?

395
00:17:44,831 --> 00:17:45,863
Which that?

396
00:17:45,932 --> 00:17:47,331
That, the brown-haired that.

397
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:48,899
Mmm...

398
00:17:48,968 --> 00:17:50,845
That with the brown hair and
the nice ass and the perfect...

399
00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:52,403
Teeth, yes. Have you?

400
00:17:52,472 --> 00:17:55,189
No. Mmm-mmm. She
only goes for the attendings.

401
00:17:55,257 --> 00:17:56,324
Next year.

402
00:18:06,986 --> 00:18:08,152
Did you see that?

403
00:18:08,221 --> 00:18:09,454
What?

404
00:18:09,522 --> 00:18:11,066
The way that woman
looked at me and Zola.

405
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,519
Derek, we're hot doctors with
babies. Women are gonna stare.

406
00:18:13,543 --> 00:18:14,792
I think she's racist.

407
00:18:15,695 --> 00:18:16,994
Oh, I get it.

408
00:18:17,063 --> 00:18:19,413
You're worried about
bridging the cultural divide.

409
00:18:19,481 --> 00:18:21,516
I know all about it.

410
00:18:21,584 --> 00:18:22,744
That's why I learned Spanish.

411
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:32,905
You know she
doesn't speak Spanish?

412
00:18:32,929 --> 00:18:35,196
Oh, but she shall.

413
00:18:37,634 --> 00:18:38,733
You shall.

414
00:18:38,801 --> 00:18:41,435
See? Bridging the divide.

415
00:18:41,504 --> 00:18:43,515
How's it going with
your better half?

416
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:46,506
He's uptight, worried about
the boards, snapping at patients.

417
00:18:46,575 --> 00:18:47,869
I'm trying to get
him laid, but...

418
00:18:47,893 --> 00:18:49,309
I'm talking about Julia.

419
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:51,278
Oh. Of course.

420
00:18:51,346 --> 00:18:52,880
She's...

421
00:18:52,949 --> 00:18:55,148
She's good, thanks.
She's doing well.

422
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:56,367
Good.

423
00:18:59,772 --> 00:19:00,871
Hello.

424
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:02,888
Hey.

425
00:19:02,926 --> 00:19:05,910
I have to listen to his chest.

426
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:10,214
Hey, Ali. How you doing?

427
00:19:10,283 --> 00:19:12,065
Why do you call him that?

428
00:19:12,134 --> 00:19:14,635
It's for the preemie
babies without names

429
00:19:14,704 --> 00:19:18,739
or the ones with weak
names, like Felix or Claude.

430
00:19:18,808 --> 00:19:20,402
You know, we like to
give them fighters' names,

431
00:19:20,426 --> 00:19:24,262
like Boris or Butch or... Molly,

432
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:26,010
you know, to help
them weather the storm.

433
00:19:26,649 --> 00:19:27,848
I like that.

434
00:19:29,051 --> 00:19:31,001
We'll take what we can get. Hmm.

435
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:32,270
How are his lungs?

436
00:19:32,305 --> 00:19:35,373
Well, they're still wet,
so I may up his Lasix.

437
00:19:35,441 --> 00:19:37,641
His pulse ox isn't great either.

438
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:40,928
Uh, where's Chris?

439
00:19:43,165 --> 00:19:44,799
I don't know.

440
00:19:44,867 --> 00:19:48,602
He keeps saying that he's making
calls, updating his family, but...

441
00:19:48,671 --> 00:19:51,111
I think he just can't be here.

442
00:19:54,093 --> 00:19:56,376
Do you think we're
doing the right thing?

443
00:19:58,147 --> 00:19:59,379
Well, as a doctor,

444
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:02,216
I look at Ali's odds, and
I'm not very optimistic.

445
00:20:04,437 --> 00:20:06,237
But...

446
00:20:06,306 --> 00:20:08,105
Hey, I've seen
parents who, uh...

447
00:20:10,076 --> 00:20:11,625
They don't think like doctors.

448
00:20:11,694 --> 00:20:13,927
They see things that we don't.

449
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:16,341
I'm not gonna tell
you what to do,

450
00:20:16,365 --> 00:20:19,500
but I will say this,
Ali, he's got a...

451
00:20:19,568 --> 00:20:21,435
He's got plenty of
doctors in his corner.

452
00:20:23,272 --> 00:20:24,689
You make sure he's got a parent.

453
00:20:28,661 --> 00:20:29,760
Dr. Karev.

454
00:20:31,965 --> 00:20:34,548
We're thinking of
naming him Thomas,

455
00:20:35,117 --> 00:20:36,317
after my dad.

456
00:20:38,087 --> 00:20:40,304
Is that tough enough?

457
00:20:40,373 --> 00:20:43,057
Tommy? Tommy's good.

458
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:51,682
You paged?

459
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:53,850
Uh, yes. When you finish
your surgery with Torres,

460
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,052
I need you to check
on my post-op patients.

461
00:20:56,121 --> 00:20:57,121
I'm going home.

462
00:20:57,189 --> 00:20:58,505
Something happen?

463
00:20:58,574 --> 00:21:00,057
Adele's not having a good day.

464
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,459
Rose Ridge, Richard.

465
00:21:02,528 --> 00:21:05,340
I'm telling you, you
really should look into it.

466
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:07,498
We went to Rose Ridge.

467
00:21:07,566 --> 00:21:10,484
Rose Ridge doesn't have
anything that I can't give her.

468
00:21:10,552 --> 00:21:12,286
Rose Ridge is not the answer.

469
00:21:15,591 --> 00:21:17,724
She burned your hand.

470
00:21:17,793 --> 00:21:20,288
You think you can
handle this, but you can't.

471
00:21:20,312 --> 00:21:22,162
I know. I have
been through this.

472
00:21:22,231 --> 00:21:26,400
The difference between you and
Ellis and me and Adele, Meredith,

473
00:21:26,468 --> 00:21:28,468
I made vows to Adele,

474
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:30,954
vows to cherish her
and be true to her,

475
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:33,056
in sickness and in health,

476
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,992
vows that I have
broken time and again.

477
00:21:36,061 --> 00:21:38,662
The least I could do
is honor her in sickness

478
00:21:38,731 --> 00:21:40,897
and give her the
home that she deserves

479
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:43,734
and the best care there is.

480
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:47,471
She stays home, and
if necessary, so do I.

481
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,887
Did you have any
pets growing up?

482
00:22:02,955 --> 00:22:04,054
Uh...

483
00:22:04,123 --> 00:22:07,725
A fish tank, couple of
hamsters, two dogs, why?

484
00:22:07,777 --> 00:22:09,438
I'm just trying to get to
know you better. That's it.

485
00:22:09,462 --> 00:22:11,178
Okay.

486
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:12,379
What were your dogs' names?

487
00:22:12,448 --> 00:22:16,567
Well, let's see. Uh, there
was Buster and, um...

488
00:22:16,636 --> 00:22:18,736
Pickles. Pickles
was a schnauzer...

489
00:22:18,805 --> 00:22:20,085
What's your mother's
maiden name?

490
00:22:22,074 --> 00:22:23,574
Are you hacking me?

491
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:26,010
I need the nurses' schedule.

492
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:27,578
I don't schedule the nurses.

493
00:22:27,646 --> 00:22:28,791
If knew anything about
how this hospital was run...

494
00:22:28,815 --> 00:22:30,514
You know the nurses' schedule.

495
00:22:30,582 --> 00:22:33,517
You are April Kepner.
You know everything.

496
00:22:38,591 --> 00:22:39,831
Anyone in particular?

497
00:22:39,875 --> 00:22:41,742
Uh... Um...

498
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:43,877
Emily someone.

499
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:46,197
Emily. Let's see.

500
00:22:46,265 --> 00:22:47,976
Ah. She was on days in the CCU,

501
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,211
but then she switched to nights

502
00:22:49,235 --> 00:22:50,500
in the surgical ICU.

503
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:52,247
Handling traumas,
which is weird,

504
00:22:52,271 --> 00:22:55,367
but Dr. Hunt signed off
on it, so it should be fine.

505
00:22:55,391 --> 00:22:59,159
Hey, if I see her crying or
bleeding, I'll come after you.

506
00:23:00,029 --> 00:23:01,228
Hacker.

507
00:23:03,699 --> 00:23:05,699
Iliac artery is mobilized.

508
00:23:05,767 --> 00:23:07,818
Okay. Let me get in there.

509
00:23:09,038 --> 00:23:11,305
You know what might be fun?

510
00:23:11,374 --> 00:23:13,268
I have no idea
what might be fun.

511
00:23:13,292 --> 00:23:16,093
A play date with Zola and Tuck.

512
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:20,146
Oh! Uh...

513
00:23:20,215 --> 00:23:24,835
Well, Tuck's five,
and Zola's, what, one?

514
00:23:24,887 --> 00:23:26,653
One and a quarter.

515
00:23:26,722 --> 00:23:28,717
But it's more like she's
three. She's very mature.

516
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:31,609
Well...

517
00:23:31,677 --> 00:23:34,378
Playing for Tuck
means throwing things,

518
00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:37,192
breaking things, shooting
things at people and things.

519
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:39,978
I don't think Zola would
survive a play date with Tuck.

520
00:23:40,002 --> 00:23:43,804
Yeah. It's probably not a
good idea. Forceps, please.

521
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:47,691
There's gotta be some kids
down in day care closer to her age,

522
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,960
even if they aren't as advanced.

523
00:23:51,497 --> 00:23:53,463
I don't want her
to feel out of place.

524
00:23:53,532 --> 00:23:55,566
It might be nice if she
could hang out with...

525
00:23:55,635 --> 00:23:57,518
Kids who...

526
00:23:58,921 --> 00:24:00,521
Have the same...

527
00:24:01,323 --> 00:24:02,890
Same roots.

528
00:24:04,093 --> 00:24:05,342
Roots?

529
00:24:05,978 --> 00:24:07,344
You know...

530
00:24:10,333 --> 00:24:12,533
Okay, let's just
resect the tumor.

531
00:24:16,522 --> 00:24:18,405
The oscillator isn't the answer.

532
00:24:18,473 --> 00:24:20,719
Then liquid ventilation. It
could improve his lung function.

533
00:24:20,743 --> 00:24:22,209
Morgan.

534
00:24:22,278 --> 00:24:25,629
You are his dad, not his
doctor. You can't just give up.

535
00:24:25,697 --> 00:24:26,963
It's not about giving up.

536
00:24:27,032 --> 00:24:28,299
He's still alive.

537
00:24:28,367 --> 00:24:30,212
It's about doing
more harm than good.

538
00:24:30,236 --> 00:24:32,986
How is letting him
die good, Chris. How?

539
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:34,988
I know you.

540
00:24:35,057 --> 00:24:37,402
Deep down, we're both
thinking the exact same thing.

541
00:24:37,426 --> 00:24:39,760
Tell me what we're
thinking, Chris.

542
00:24:42,598 --> 00:24:45,916
We're thinking that getting
pregnant was an accident,

543
00:24:45,985 --> 00:24:48,380
that this baby should
not be alive right now,

544
00:24:48,404 --> 00:24:50,070
that its chances of survival

545
00:24:50,139 --> 00:24:53,051
or having any kind of life
worth living are slim to none,

546
00:24:53,075 --> 00:24:55,103
that doing every damn
thing we can to keep it alive

547
00:24:55,127 --> 00:24:57,439
is just so that we can feel good
about ourselves after he dies.

548
00:24:57,463 --> 00:24:59,040
Now can you admit any of that?

549
00:25:06,205 --> 00:25:07,854
Just go.

550
00:25:07,924 --> 00:25:09,685
You can't cut me out
of these decisions.

551
00:25:09,709 --> 00:25:11,225
I'm not cutting you out.

552
00:25:12,161 --> 00:25:13,810
I'm offering you an out.

553
00:25:16,015 --> 00:25:17,255
What are you saying?

554
00:25:18,167 --> 00:25:19,807
I'm saying, take the out, Chris,

555
00:25:21,337 --> 00:25:23,653
because maybe you
can't admit it now,

556
00:25:23,722 --> 00:25:26,306
in the light of day,
but you want it.

557
00:25:37,186 --> 00:25:38,763
How are you doing
on your end, Torres?

558
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:40,620
How are we doing, Grey?

559
00:25:40,689 --> 00:25:43,368
Uh, good. I'm just finishing
up this arterial repair,

560
00:25:43,392 --> 00:25:45,237
and then I'm
gonna put in the rod.

561
00:25:45,261 --> 00:25:47,722
It's bad enough the girl he
loves has no idea he exists.

562
00:25:47,746 --> 00:25:50,041
Now the TSA is gonna
hassle him for the rest of his life.

563
00:25:50,065 --> 00:25:51,931
Burned barista
doesn't know who he is?

564
00:25:52,001 --> 00:25:54,729
Nope. Never even heard of him.

565
00:25:54,753 --> 00:25:55,819
Where are we?

566
00:25:57,990 --> 00:25:59,089
Dr. Altman?

567
00:25:59,158 --> 00:26:00,674
He's fine. Shrapnel's out.

568
00:26:00,742 --> 00:26:01,875
Good.

569
00:26:03,612 --> 00:26:06,091
Did you all hear that
Dr. Altman got a huge grant

570
00:26:06,115 --> 00:26:07,331
for her stem cell research?

571
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:09,499
I did. Congratulations,
Dr. Altman.

572
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:10,617
Thank you.

573
00:26:10,685 --> 00:26:13,337
I hear that Dr. Silverman
at Wake Forest

574
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:14,782
has been doing great
work in stem cells.

575
00:26:14,806 --> 00:26:16,067
Maybe you should
give her a call...

576
00:26:16,091 --> 00:26:19,859
If I wanted your advice
on my specialty, Dr. Hunt,

577
00:26:19,928 --> 00:26:21,077
I'll ask.

578
00:26:22,698 --> 00:26:24,664
Once Teddy's done with the lung,

579
00:26:24,733 --> 00:26:27,533
you can get at the other arm to
get out the remaining shrapnel.

580
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,486
All right. Okay.

581
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,590
Here. I'll help you finish.

582
00:26:33,659 --> 00:26:35,036
I've got it. No,
no, it'd be easier...

583
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:37,420
I said I've got it.
Now back the hell off.

584
00:26:52,511 --> 00:26:53,643
You're an attractive woman.

585
00:26:54,447 --> 00:26:56,196
Who? Uh, me?

586
00:26:56,264 --> 00:26:58,459
You and Avery spend a lot
of time together, don't you?

587
00:26:58,483 --> 00:27:00,695
We do, yes. Uh... But
we're just study buddies.

588
00:27:00,719 --> 00:27:02,430
I mean, we're not, you know...

589
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:05,055
He's an attractive guy,
nice bone structure,

590
00:27:05,124 --> 00:27:06,790
hypnotic eyes, etcetera.

591
00:27:06,859 --> 00:27:08,008
I guess so?

592
00:27:08,077 --> 00:27:09,738
Have you noticed how
uptight he's been lately?

593
00:27:09,762 --> 00:27:11,839
Uh, like I said, we're
study buddies, so...

594
00:27:11,863 --> 00:27:14,298
Study buddies should
help each other out,

595
00:27:14,366 --> 00:27:16,366
relieve some of that stress.

596
00:27:17,603 --> 00:27:20,487
Maybe extend that
buddy relationship.

597
00:27:20,556 --> 00:27:23,189
Extend? Um, I don't...

598
00:27:23,259 --> 00:27:24,758
You're two attractive people.

599
00:27:24,827 --> 00:27:28,011
Any thoughts on how
to alleviate that stress?

600
00:27:28,981 --> 00:27:31,047
We could go for more walks?

601
00:27:31,116 --> 00:27:32,516
Walks are good.

602
00:27:32,585 --> 00:27:33,934
Walks are nice.

603
00:27:34,002 --> 00:27:36,537
I was thinking, since
you're already study buddies,

604
00:27:37,606 --> 00:27:39,606
you could extend
that relationship,

605
00:27:41,176 --> 00:27:42,592
become the other
kind of buddies.

606
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:45,412
Are you...

607
00:27:45,481 --> 00:27:47,013
I am.

608
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:48,165
Dr. Sloan!

609
00:27:48,233 --> 00:27:50,150
Everybody wins.

610
00:27:50,218 --> 00:27:52,013
This is sexual harassment.
You know that, right?

611
00:27:52,037 --> 00:27:53,920
I think of it as sexual
encouragement.

612
00:27:55,774 --> 00:27:57,440
Think about it, Kepner.

613
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:58,975
Take one for the team.

614
00:28:01,113 --> 00:28:02,891
You got her the grant money.

615
00:28:02,915 --> 00:28:04,459
Look, I know you did.
You have to tell her.

616
00:28:04,483 --> 00:28:05,794
It'll help things
between you guys.

617
00:28:05,818 --> 00:28:07,462
No, it won't. All
right, then I'll tell her.

618
00:28:07,486 --> 00:28:08,785
No, you won't.

619
00:28:08,854 --> 00:28:10,849
You can't let her
treat you this way.

620
00:28:10,873 --> 00:28:12,516
When Henry died, you
were just doing your job.

621
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:13,780
You're not a bad guy.

622
00:28:15,611 --> 00:28:17,460
How do you know?

623
00:28:17,929 --> 00:28:19,513
Look...

624
00:28:19,581 --> 00:28:22,316
Sometimes, you just lash out.
It might not be rational or fair,

625
00:28:22,384 --> 00:28:23,728
but you do it
'cause you have to.

626
00:28:23,752 --> 00:28:26,035
If she needs me for that, if
she needs a punching bag,

627
00:28:26,104 --> 00:28:28,839
a bad guy to point the
finger at and help her cope,

628
00:28:28,907 --> 00:28:30,708
then let that be me.

629
00:28:30,776 --> 00:28:33,221
Fine, you can be a martyr,
but you still have to be the Chief.

630
00:28:33,245 --> 00:28:34,656
And what happened
in that OR today,

631
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,840
that should never happen again.

632
00:28:45,374 --> 00:28:47,941
We were able to repair your
lung and fix your shoulder,

633
00:28:48,010 --> 00:28:50,321
but you're gonna need months
of rehab. How are you feeling?

634
00:28:50,345 --> 00:28:52,440
Like I got hit by a dump truck.

635
00:28:52,464 --> 00:28:54,814
Yeah, it's gonna feel
like that for a little while.

636
00:28:54,883 --> 00:28:59,903
But don't be afraid to use
your PCA pump for pain meds.

637
00:28:59,972 --> 00:29:02,012
So has Angie come by the room?

638
00:29:03,409 --> 00:29:04,791
I didn't miss her, did I?

639
00:29:08,514 --> 00:29:10,313
Angie has no idea who you are.

640
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:12,649
What?

641
00:29:12,718 --> 00:29:14,484
That's ridiculous.

642
00:29:15,287 --> 00:29:16,620
She knows my order.

643
00:29:17,623 --> 00:29:18,700
I don't even have to say it.

644
00:29:18,724 --> 00:29:19,923
That's her job.

645
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,080
The accident.

646
00:29:22,728 --> 00:29:24,294
She's confused.

647
00:29:24,363 --> 00:29:26,063
She knows me.

648
00:29:26,132 --> 00:29:27,798
We have this thing,

649
00:29:27,867 --> 00:29:29,766
this flirtation.

650
00:29:33,171 --> 00:29:35,171
What did she say?

651
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,600
Tell me exactly what she said.

652
00:29:37,843 --> 00:29:40,911
That she doesn't have
any idea who you are.

653
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:43,213
That's exactly what she said.

654
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:45,131
You've made up this
whole thing in your head.

655
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,151
No. You don't understand.

656
00:29:47,219 --> 00:29:48,285
I do.

657
00:29:49,137 --> 00:29:50,504
It happens.

658
00:29:50,572 --> 00:29:51,772
I mean, you see one thing

659
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,585
and you think it means
something that it doesn't,

660
00:29:53,609 --> 00:29:56,176
and pretty soon, you're
acting like it's real.

661
00:29:57,279 --> 00:29:58,445
You have to stop.

662
00:29:59,114 --> 00:30:00,380
You have to just...

663
00:30:01,349 --> 00:30:02,415
Stop.

664
00:30:07,289 --> 00:30:10,490
This should improve his cardiovascular
and pulmonary status, right?

665
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:11,670
That's the plan.

666
00:30:11,694 --> 00:30:13,004
When will we
know if it's working?

667
00:30:13,028 --> 00:30:14,127
In a couple of hours.

668
00:30:14,196 --> 00:30:15,774
But you should go
rest. We'll update you.

669
00:30:15,798 --> 00:30:18,832
Chris left. I'm all he has
now. I'm not going anywhere.

670
00:30:18,901 --> 00:30:20,796
Well, it's better
if you go rest.

671
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:22,313
It can be hard for
parents to watch.

672
00:30:22,337 --> 00:30:25,154
I appreciate the concern,
but I'm a doctor, too.

673
00:30:26,708 --> 00:30:27,974
Let's do this.

674
00:30:35,434 --> 00:30:36,650
Oh, God.

675
00:30:46,629 --> 00:30:47,661
What's up?

676
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:48,845
Hi.

677
00:30:51,166 --> 00:30:52,182
Um...

678
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,520
You paged?

679
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:01,141
I wanted to...

680
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,826
What?

681
00:31:05,347 --> 00:31:06,827
Hey, what are you
doing? Cristina...

682
00:31:06,881 --> 00:31:08,459
No, you can spare 15
minutes. I don't have time.

683
00:31:08,483 --> 00:31:09,860
No, I'm working in the
ER. No, we'll be quick.

684
00:31:09,884 --> 00:31:11,396
I don't have time. So fast.

685
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:12,714
Cristina, I don't...
So, so fast.

686
00:31:12,738 --> 00:31:15,321
Damn it. Damn it.
I don't have time.

687
00:31:20,595 --> 00:31:21,811
Owen...

688
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:29,046
- Mrs. Webber...
- Get back.

689
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:30,315
Adele? WOMAN: Put that down!

690
00:31:30,339 --> 00:31:31,549
Get out!

691
00:31:31,573 --> 00:31:32,672
Sweetheart!

692
00:31:33,776 --> 00:31:34,776
Adele!

693
00:31:34,843 --> 00:31:35,920
Get out of my house right now!

694
00:31:35,944 --> 00:31:37,064
Make her stop!

695
00:31:37,129 --> 00:31:38,378
Adele!

696
00:31:38,446 --> 00:31:39,863
Listen to me. I'm here.

697
00:31:39,932 --> 00:31:41,626
Get away from me!
Look at me, honey.

698
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:42,766
I'm calling the police!

699
00:31:42,835 --> 00:31:44,262
Adele, it's me, your
husband, Richard.

700
00:31:44,286 --> 00:31:45,352
Get back!

701
00:31:45,421 --> 00:31:46,803
It's me, Richard.

702
00:31:46,872 --> 00:31:47,921
Don't hurt me.

703
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:50,301
Look, I'm your husband, Richard.

704
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:53,159
Please go. Please leave.

705
00:31:53,228 --> 00:31:55,862
My parents will be here.
They'll be home any minute.

706
00:31:55,931 --> 00:31:58,932
It's me, Adele, your
husband. I'm your husband.

707
00:31:59,001 --> 00:32:01,801
I'm your husband!
I'm your husband!

708
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:14,147
How's he doing?

709
00:32:14,215 --> 00:32:15,481
He's holding steady for now,

710
00:32:15,551 --> 00:32:17,832
but we won't know anything
for a few more hours.

711
00:32:19,805 --> 00:32:21,321
I had to know before I left.

712
00:32:22,424 --> 00:32:23,556
Sure.

713
00:32:24,225 --> 00:32:26,009
I'd stay, I would.

714
00:32:29,848 --> 00:32:33,466
I would, but I've got people
working doubles covering my shifts,

715
00:32:33,535 --> 00:32:36,019
and we're in the middle of a
clinical trial right now, and...

716
00:32:37,689 --> 00:32:38,838
You know how it is, right?

717
00:32:47,833 --> 00:32:49,032
Thank you.

718
00:32:53,639 --> 00:32:55,272
Do you have a problem?

719
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:56,550
Excuse me? Oh, no.

720
00:32:56,574 --> 00:32:58,008
It is 2012.

721
00:32:58,076 --> 00:32:59,236
You want to be
shocked by the sight

722
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:00,405
of a white man
with a black baby,

723
00:33:00,429 --> 00:33:01,639
you're about three
decades too late!

724
00:33:01,663 --> 00:33:03,630
I'm sorry. Don't listen to him.

725
00:33:03,698 --> 00:33:05,765
What is wrong...
She's unbelievable.

726
00:33:05,834 --> 00:33:07,100
She was not staring at you

727
00:33:07,168 --> 00:33:09,535
because daddy's white
and his daughter is black.

728
00:33:09,605 --> 00:33:13,706
She was staring at you two
because daddy has nice hair,

729
00:33:13,775 --> 00:33:16,042
maybe perfect hair,
but for whatever reason,

730
00:33:16,111 --> 00:33:18,695
his daughter's hair
is 31 flavors of wrong.

731
00:33:18,764 --> 00:33:20,230
It's hard on the eyes.

732
00:33:20,299 --> 00:33:24,167
Look, you are white, but
your daughter is black.

733
00:33:24,236 --> 00:33:25,886
Do your baby's hair!

734
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,380
What are you doing? Stop it. Ow!

735
00:33:37,449 --> 00:33:38,798
What's the plan?

736
00:33:38,867 --> 00:33:40,945
You have bony, sharp fingers.
What plan? There's no plan.

737
00:33:40,969 --> 00:33:43,353
Your plan, which
makes it our plan.

738
00:33:43,421 --> 00:33:45,366
Whatever it is, I need to know.

739
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:47,485
Are you plotting a
murder, a nuclear attack?

740
00:33:47,509 --> 00:33:49,904
It's fine. I'll get on board. I'm
sure you have a good reason.

741
00:33:49,928 --> 00:33:53,208
But just let me know. You're
starting to freak me out.

742
00:34:05,594 --> 00:34:08,144
I think Owen is cheating on me.

743
00:34:08,213 --> 00:34:09,453
Did you see something?

744
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,848
No.

745
00:34:11,917 --> 00:34:13,027
Did someone else see something?

746
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:14,467
No.

747
00:34:14,536 --> 00:34:16,163
Did he do something? No.

748
00:34:16,187 --> 00:34:17,464
Well, then how do you know...

749
00:34:17,488 --> 00:34:19,408
I don't know. I
don't know! I just...

750
00:34:20,759 --> 00:34:21,891
Know.

751
00:34:29,517 --> 00:34:30,662
Cristina...

752
00:34:30,686 --> 00:34:31,918
You know what? I am...

753
00:34:31,987 --> 00:34:34,253
I'm being crazy.
I'm crazy, right?

754
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:37,324
This is totally...

755
00:34:37,392 --> 00:34:40,360
I'm crazy. I'm just...

756
00:34:40,428 --> 00:34:42,995
We're having a
hard time, and I'm...

757
00:34:43,064 --> 00:34:44,964
I'm making it into... I'm crazy.

758
00:34:45,033 --> 00:34:47,850
I'm... I'm crazy.

759
00:34:54,026 --> 00:34:55,226
Okay.

760
00:35:00,682 --> 00:35:02,749
I really think
he's not cheating.

761
00:35:02,818 --> 00:35:03,917
I know that.

762
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:19,932
Julia has a friend.
She's pretty.

763
00:35:20,502 --> 00:35:21,634
Uh...

764
00:35:21,703 --> 00:35:23,815
A little brooding and
tattoo-y for my taste,

765
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:26,523
but, pretty.

766
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:28,703
Bet you're into that
sort of thing, huh?

767
00:35:28,727 --> 00:35:31,060
For the last time, I do
not need a girlfriend.

768
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:33,074
Who said anything
about girlfriend?

769
00:35:33,098 --> 00:35:36,232
One double date. Help me
out with a third-wheel situation.

770
00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:39,119
So, so tempting,
but no, thank you.

771
00:35:39,938 --> 00:35:41,018
All right.

772
00:35:42,374 --> 00:35:44,652
But you need to
get out there, man.

773
00:35:44,676 --> 00:35:46,137
Doing yourself a
huge disservice.

774
00:35:46,161 --> 00:35:48,428
I had a girlfriend, all right?

775
00:35:49,297 --> 00:35:50,530
Now I just can't.

776
00:35:51,365 --> 00:35:52,865
I don't want to.

777
00:35:52,934 --> 00:35:54,284
What do you mean, you can't?

778
00:35:58,006 --> 00:35:59,246
You still love her.

779
00:36:01,726 --> 00:36:02,803
You still love Lexie.

780
00:36:03,895 --> 00:36:05,828
See you tomorrow.

781
00:36:05,897 --> 00:36:07,680
I can't wait to
get back to Neuro.

782
00:36:07,749 --> 00:36:10,189
At least with lost causes,
you know where you stand,

783
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:13,586
and the patients can tell you
when they have had enough.

784
00:36:13,655 --> 00:36:16,856
I don't know how
Morgan can bear it. I...

785
00:36:16,925 --> 00:36:19,125
I don't know how any of you can.

786
00:36:21,496 --> 00:36:22,829
Come here.

787
00:36:27,502 --> 00:36:30,687
Jolene Jordano, 1
pound, 4 ounces at birth.

788
00:36:30,755 --> 00:36:33,606
She's 12 years old
now. She's a goalie. Uh...

789
00:36:34,776 --> 00:36:37,577
Benji Gellerman, 1
pound, 2 ounces at birth.

790
00:36:37,646 --> 00:36:40,096
He's 9 years old,
plays the trumpet.

791
00:36:40,165 --> 00:36:42,543
This one, Hannah Slavin?
I worked on her myself.

792
00:36:42,567 --> 00:36:44,111
She looked like a hamster
when she came out.

793
00:36:44,135 --> 00:36:46,669
Her dad just called, said
she took her first steps.

794
00:36:47,506 --> 00:36:49,372
Some of them survive.

795
00:37:41,309 --> 00:37:43,275
What happened?

796
00:37:44,446 --> 00:37:47,346
Did you have an accident?

797
00:37:47,415 --> 00:37:50,966
Richard, your hand,
did you hurt your hand?

798
00:37:51,035 --> 00:37:52,502
I'm fine. I'm fine.

799
00:37:54,839 --> 00:37:56,422
Did I hurt your hand?

800
00:37:58,443 --> 00:37:59,609
Um...

801
00:37:59,677 --> 00:38:01,978
You know, how about some dinner?

802
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:03,646
I'll heat up the lasagna.

803
00:38:04,966 --> 00:38:06,283
I have Alzheimer's.

804
00:38:11,239 --> 00:38:12,522
Don't I?

805
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,473
Yes, sweetheart.

806
00:38:31,876 --> 00:38:32,908
You do.

807
00:38:37,715 --> 00:38:39,432
Rose Ridge, it...

808
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,734
It seemed like a nice place.

809
00:38:41,803 --> 00:38:43,769
We went there this
morning, didn't we?

810
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:46,756
Yes, we did.

811
00:38:49,544 --> 00:38:51,344
I think it's best

812
00:38:53,615 --> 00:38:54,997
if I were to go live there.

813
00:38:56,585 --> 00:39:00,903
You don't have to do that.
I mean, you can stay here.

814
00:39:00,972 --> 00:39:02,672
I like having you here.

815
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:03,956
I liked it there.

816
00:39:04,042 --> 00:39:06,509
Your home is here with me.

817
00:39:09,164 --> 00:39:11,330
I'd rather be there.

818
00:39:22,894 --> 00:39:24,527
Okay, sweetheart.

819
00:39:27,398 --> 00:39:29,165
Okay.

820
00:39:29,233 --> 00:39:31,801
<i>You can seek the
advice of others.</i>

821
00:39:35,957 --> 00:39:37,017
Is that right? Am I stroking...

822
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:38,219
And I pull it up? Yeah.

823
00:39:38,243 --> 00:39:40,443
<i>Surround yourself
with trusted advisors.</i>

824
00:39:40,512 --> 00:39:41,672
There you go.

825
00:39:43,331 --> 00:39:44,392
Like that? Mmm-hmm.

826
00:39:44,416 --> 00:39:46,632
Gather, yep. Gather, good.

827
00:39:46,701 --> 00:39:47,750
Hi.

828
00:39:47,819 --> 00:39:49,001
Hey, Meredith.

829
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:51,804
Did you know Zola has a kitchen?

830
00:39:53,174 --> 00:39:54,307
Yes, Derek.

831
00:39:54,375 --> 00:39:56,609
I know all about Zola's kitchen.

832
00:39:56,678 --> 00:39:57,798
Now I want... Do I turn it?

833
00:39:57,862 --> 00:39:59,178
Gather everything in.

834
00:39:59,247 --> 00:40:01,567
Pull the kitchen up.
Pull the kitchen up.

835
00:40:07,305 --> 00:40:10,272
<i>But in the end, the
decision is always yours.</i>

836
00:40:24,239 --> 00:40:25,871
<i>And yours alone.</i>

837
00:40:30,912 --> 00:40:34,314
<i>And when it's time to
act, and you're all alone</i>

838
00:40:34,382 --> 00:40:36,816
<i>with your back
against the wall...</i>

839
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:32,055
<i>The only voice that matters
is the one in your head.</i>

840
00:41:39,397 --> 00:41:40,663
Cristina?

841
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:08,390
<i>The one telling you what
you probably already knew.</i>

842
00:42:14,416 --> 00:42:17,249
<i>The one that's
almost always right.</i>
