1
00:00:02,403 --> 00:00:04,536
<i>"I Had a terrible day."</i>

2
00:00:04,605 --> 00:00:06,438
<i>We say it all the time.</i>

3
00:00:06,507 --> 00:00:09,708
<i>A fight with the
boss, the stomach flu,</i>

4
00:00:09,776 --> 00:00:11,688
<i>traffic...</i>

5
00:00:11,712 --> 00:00:13,790
Okay, try and breathe for me.

6
00:00:13,814 --> 00:00:15,334
I'm trying.

7
00:00:21,222 --> 00:00:22,988
Okay, okay.

8
00:00:24,225 --> 00:00:26,691
<i>That's what we
describe as terrible</i>

9
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,243
<i>when nothing
terrible is happening.</i>

10
00:00:30,548 --> 00:00:33,448
Okay, okay. You're
gonna be okay.

11
00:00:34,351 --> 00:00:35,778
Let's get a good line in him.

12
00:00:35,802 --> 00:00:37,347
Okay, and where is X-ray?
Get them in here, stat.

13
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:40,171
He hasn't been having
trouble with his VHL.

14
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,858
No tumors since...

15
00:00:42,943 --> 00:00:45,894
When was your
last CT? It was June.

16
00:00:45,963 --> 00:00:47,203
Dr. Webber did a full workup.

17
00:00:47,264 --> 00:00:49,425
Okay, then let's page
Dr. Webber, please.

18
00:00:49,449 --> 00:00:50,861
Right away, Doctor.
His veins are shot.

19
00:00:50,885 --> 00:00:52,695
Let's go ahead and
put in a central line.

20
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,681
We're gonna put a line in
so we can give you IV fluids.

21
00:00:54,705 --> 00:00:56,171
Once we get the X-ray back,

22
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:58,359
we should have a better
idea of what's going on.

23
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:03,528
We got him. Okay?

24
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:07,627
Yeah. Yeah.

25
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:08,984
All right.

26
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:14,599
Okay, well, what about the eye?

27
00:01:14,674 --> 00:01:16,274
Good. We'll be waiting.

28
00:01:16,343 --> 00:01:18,326
Okay.

29
00:01:18,395 --> 00:01:20,506
Oh, hey, Avery. We got a kid
with half his face torn off by a dog,

30
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:22,275
so can you get Sloan
and meet me outside?

31
00:01:22,299 --> 00:01:23,927
And see if Shepherd's still
here, 'cause we may need him.

32
00:01:23,951 --> 00:01:25,591
Okay.

33
00:01:25,652 --> 00:01:27,252
Dr. Robbins.

34
00:01:27,321 --> 00:01:29,154
You're popular tonight.

35
00:01:29,223 --> 00:01:31,023
Hey, this is Robbins.

36
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:32,324
Right now?

37
00:01:32,393 --> 00:01:33,658
Where?

38
00:01:36,196 --> 00:01:37,963
That was pathetic. Shut up.

39
00:01:39,332 --> 00:01:41,144
She told you to
go screw yourself.

40
00:01:41,168 --> 00:01:42,595
We could hear it all
the way over here.

41
00:01:42,619 --> 00:01:44,197
It's not 'cause
she wasn't into me.

42
00:01:44,221 --> 00:01:46,755
Oh. Does "go screw yourself"
have some secret meaning

43
00:01:46,823 --> 00:01:48,063
we're not aware of?

44
00:01:48,125 --> 00:01:50,492
I kinda already knew
her. I just didn't remember.

45
00:01:53,597 --> 00:01:55,591
You slept with her
before and forgot about it,

46
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:57,127
and then tried to pick
her up all over again?

47
00:01:57,151 --> 00:01:58,984
You're not even drinking.

48
00:01:59,053 --> 00:02:00,196
I have a history of
Alzheimer's in my family.

49
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,669
What's your excuse?

50
00:02:01,738 --> 00:02:03,716
It's O'Malley's fault. I mean,
talking about dead people,

51
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:05,184
it throws me off
my game, that's all.

52
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:06,319
Mmm. Mmm.

53
00:02:07,811 --> 00:02:09,322
It's Janet. Can you
pay for my thing?

54
00:02:09,346 --> 00:02:10,439
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

55
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:12,330
Hey, hey, Janet. I gotta run.

56
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:13,782
Would you pay for mine?

57
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:15,479
No. I'm leaving. I'm
going to the skills lab.

58
00:02:15,503 --> 00:02:16,952
Oh, come on.

59
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:18,264
She had the social
worker on the phone.

60
00:02:18,288 --> 00:02:20,528
You can fish 20 bucks
out of your pocket.

61
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:30,577
I want to see you for
a follow-up next week.

62
00:02:30,601 --> 00:02:33,602
And listen, I know Drew
is a kid with a lot of energy,

63
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:35,548
but we just put a bunch
of screws in your back,

64
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:37,805
so you gotta take it
easy for a few weeks.

65
00:02:37,874 --> 00:02:39,774
And I am not kidding
about physical therapy.

66
00:02:39,843 --> 00:02:41,387
You're gonna need all
the support you can get

67
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:43,245
to keep up with that little one.

68
00:02:43,313 --> 00:02:45,633
I'm gonna do it. I really am.

69
00:02:46,883 --> 00:02:48,683
You feelin' okay?
I still kinda like

70
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:50,347
the idea of keeping
you here another day.

71
00:02:50,371 --> 00:02:52,170
No, it's been three days.

72
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,656
You know, it's hard on
Drew. He needs his mom.

73
00:02:54,724 --> 00:02:56,124
I just want to get home.

74
00:02:56,193 --> 00:02:57,492
Okay.

75
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,405
Mommy! Hey, sweetheart!

76
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:00,929
Hey! Hi.

77
00:03:00,998 --> 00:03:01,930
How are you? Hey,
careful with Mommy, okay?

78
00:03:01,999 --> 00:03:03,164
No bending.

79
00:03:03,233 --> 00:03:05,567
Hi, sweetheart. Hey.

80
00:03:05,636 --> 00:03:07,669
Oh, I missed you so much.

81
00:03:07,738 --> 00:03:09,054
Oh!

82
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:11,162
You all right?
Yeah, just stitches.

83
00:03:11,224 --> 00:03:12,558
Okay.

84
00:03:12,626 --> 00:03:14,292
Hey, Drew.

85
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:17,161
I am gonna need you to
be really gentle with Mommy

86
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,897
for a few days, okay?

87
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:20,765
Okay. All right. Okay.

88
00:03:21,502 --> 00:03:22,634
All right, guys.

89
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,047
Call me if you need
anything, okay?

90
00:03:24,071 --> 00:03:25,720
We will. Thank you so much.

91
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:27,488
Anytime. Bye.

92
00:03:30,094 --> 00:03:31,793
What did Janet say?

93
00:03:31,862 --> 00:03:33,128
Meredith?

94
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:37,683
We're not getting her back.

95
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:39,796
What do you mean?
What exactly did she say?

96
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,936
That we're not getting her back.

97
00:03:42,005 --> 00:03:43,149
She said that?

98
00:03:43,173 --> 00:03:45,506
She said that the court

99
00:03:46,343 --> 00:03:48,209
canceled our hearing date.

100
00:03:48,278 --> 00:03:51,946
And when they do that, it
means either one of two things.

101
00:03:52,016 --> 00:03:53,281
That they looked at our file,

102
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:55,600
and they love us and
they're giving her to us,

103
00:03:55,669 --> 00:03:58,052
in which case, they call
Janet and they tell her that,

104
00:03:58,121 --> 00:04:00,739
or that they hate us

105
00:04:00,808 --> 00:04:04,092
and they're giving
her to another family.

106
00:04:04,161 --> 00:04:07,779
And she didn't get
the "they love us" call.

107
00:04:07,848 --> 00:04:09,876
Well, maybe they
didn't get around to it.

108
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,383
She said we should move on.

109
00:04:12,452 --> 00:04:13,452
That's what she said.

110
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,270
You want to know
her exact words,

111
00:04:15,339 --> 00:04:19,574
were "I think it's time that you and
Derek start thinking about moving on."

112
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:24,396
Oh, my God.

113
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:26,864
Oh, God. How can they do this?

114
00:04:32,255 --> 00:04:33,700
You can cry. I
don't want to cry.

115
00:04:33,724 --> 00:04:34,956
I know.

116
00:04:39,113 --> 00:04:41,062
I'm never gonna see her again.

117
00:04:41,582 --> 00:04:42,647
God.

118
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:46,963
Okay, stop. I don't want to cry.

119
00:04:46,987 --> 00:04:48,187
Okay. I know.

120
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:08,851
Call up to CT. Tell 'em
we're on our way up.

121
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:10,620
Screw CT. And go straight
to the bronchoscope.

122
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:12,272
You need to find out
what is down there.

123
00:05:12,296 --> 00:05:14,690
CT will clarify what
we're dealing with.

124
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:17,465
It won't delay anything,
and you're not his doctor.

125
00:05:17,533 --> 00:05:19,667
Richard is.

126
00:05:19,737 --> 00:05:22,697
I hear he's good. I mean, I don't
know. He's new around here.

127
00:05:24,024 --> 00:05:26,240
She doesn't like it
when I'm in the hospital.

128
00:05:26,309 --> 00:05:28,204
Makes you wonder why she
married a guy with chronic illness.

129
00:05:28,228 --> 00:05:30,062
Masochist. Call me
if you need anything.

130
00:05:32,449 --> 00:05:34,315
I'm coming to CT.

131
00:05:38,272 --> 00:05:40,004
I wouldn't have
it any other way.

132
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:41,172
Good.

133
00:05:50,651 --> 00:05:51,827
Meredith is in the ER.

134
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:53,868
Look at this. Scalpels
from the 1860s.

135
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:55,014
I want to get 'em for Meredith.

136
00:05:55,038 --> 00:05:56,278
She needs to talk to you.

137
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:57,650
Oh, can you distract
her? It's on eBay,

138
00:05:57,674 --> 00:06:00,041
and I got 25 minutes
left on the auction.

139
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:01,270
Derek, Janet called.

140
00:06:08,818 --> 00:06:10,096
The baby was born
a couple of hours ago,

141
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,664
and it looks like a
tracheoesophageal fistula.

142
00:06:11,688 --> 00:06:13,421
You know what that is?

143
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:15,301
Yeah, it's the connection between
the trachea and esophagus.

144
00:06:15,325 --> 00:06:16,769
Fills the lungs with secretions.

145
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:18,554
Baby can have a hard
time breathing and feeding.

146
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:21,128
Exactly. Bentley Hospital
is tiny. They can't handle it.

147
00:06:21,197 --> 00:06:23,108
So you need to go pick
up the baby, bring her back,

148
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:24,343
and then hopefully,
I'm done with the kid

149
00:06:24,367 --> 00:06:25,778
that's on his way in
by the time you're back.

150
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:27,246
You need to reconfigure
the ambulance

151
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:28,637
for intensive
neonatal transport.

152
00:06:28,705 --> 00:06:29,966
And I think you should
get someone else to go...

153
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:32,101
Grey, ride with Karev.
He's on a baby run.

154
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:33,592
Well, I have to talk to Derek.

155
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:36,027
Well, newborn life hanging
in the balance. Make it fast.

156
00:06:37,714 --> 00:06:39,780
10-year-old male,
dog bite to the face.

157
00:06:39,849 --> 00:06:41,383
Vital signs stable in the field.

158
00:06:41,451 --> 00:06:42,917
All right, trauma three.

159
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,439
Laura.

160
00:06:48,492 --> 00:06:49,874
Hey, Dr. Avery.

161
00:06:49,943 --> 00:06:51,042
Honey, this is my guy.

162
00:06:51,111 --> 00:06:52,143
You must be Griffith.

163
00:06:52,212 --> 00:06:53,345
Yeah.

164
00:06:54,314 --> 00:06:55,330
And Drew.

165
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:56,876
Hey, your mom said
that you were a kid,

166
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,333
but you are almost
as tall as me.

167
00:06:58,419 --> 00:06:59,667
You're not that tall.

168
00:07:02,489 --> 00:07:04,517
So, listen, thanks so much
for taking such good care of her.

169
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:05,973
My pleasure. How you feelin'?

170
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:07,930
Just ready to go home.

171
00:07:07,995 --> 00:07:09,638
Okay, but you make
sure to give me a page

172
00:07:09,662 --> 00:07:11,730
when you come in for
a follow-up, all right?

173
00:07:11,799 --> 00:07:13,479
Nice to meet you. Okay.

174
00:07:16,336 --> 00:07:19,220
I see what you mean
about those eyes.

175
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:22,134
If I weren't such
a confident guy,

176
00:07:22,158 --> 00:07:25,438
I might have to, like, challenge
him to a duel or something.

177
00:07:27,514 --> 00:07:29,364
Honey.

178
00:07:29,433 --> 00:07:31,593
Can we get some help, please?

179
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:39,485
Maybe there's an appeal
process. Did you ask?

180
00:07:39,509 --> 00:07:40,553
I didn't.

181
00:07:40,577 --> 00:07:41,654
You talk to the lawyer?

182
00:07:41,678 --> 00:07:43,455
I just got off the
phone with Janet.

183
00:07:43,479 --> 00:07:44,924
We'll appeal. We'll sue
the agency if we have to.

184
00:07:44,948 --> 00:07:47,314
They don't think we should
be Zola's parents, Derek.

185
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:48,816
They don't think
I'm trustworthy,

186
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:50,963
and they're not the first
ones to raise that concern.

187
00:07:50,987 --> 00:07:52,070
Meredith.

188
00:07:53,273 --> 00:07:55,033
They don't think I
should be Zola's mother.

189
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:57,476
She's gone.

190
00:07:57,544 --> 00:07:58,844
It's gonna be okay.

191
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,980
We're gonna find a way.

192
00:08:03,633 --> 00:08:05,216
Zola was our baby,

193
00:08:05,285 --> 00:08:07,502
and she's gone and I
don't want another baby.

194
00:08:24,738 --> 00:08:27,438
She's barely got any
pulse. What was she in for?

195
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:30,141
A thoracic spinal
fusion to fix her scoliosis.

196
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:32,450
Dr. Torres just released
her, and she was doing fine.

197
00:08:34,248 --> 00:08:36,458
Okay, heart sounds are
muffled. Let's call Altman.

198
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:38,695
She's not protecting her
airway. I'm gonna intubate.

199
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,429
Is she okay? Sir,
there's a waiting room.

200
00:08:40,453 --> 00:08:42,114
What's happening?
Take your son out of here.

201
00:08:42,138 --> 00:08:43,621
We will let you
know when we know.

202
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,056
We're gonna need the ultrasound,

203
00:08:45,124 --> 00:08:46,775
and somebody find Torres.

204
00:08:46,843 --> 00:08:47,926
Right away.

205
00:08:49,246 --> 00:08:50,790
They can put on some music.

206
00:08:50,814 --> 00:08:52,980
No, I'll just take a nap.

207
00:08:53,049 --> 00:08:54,943
You're gonna be fine.
You know that, right?

208
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:56,167
I do.

209
00:08:56,236 --> 00:08:57,334
Good.

210
00:08:57,403 --> 00:08:58,981
I just wish I hadn't
spent the day

211
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:00,783
trying to kill your
hopes and dreams.

212
00:09:00,807 --> 00:09:02,752
You know, that's why I
started spitting up blood,

213
00:09:02,776 --> 00:09:04,242
so I'd win.

214
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,225
I'm happy to have you
go to medical school.

215
00:09:09,249 --> 00:09:11,049
You don't have to be happy.

216
00:09:11,118 --> 00:09:14,853
No, I am. I'm not...
I love med students.

217
00:09:16,155 --> 00:09:17,455
I'll help you study.

218
00:09:17,524 --> 00:09:19,257
You'll be my study buddy?

219
00:09:20,444 --> 00:09:21,893
I'll make you flash cards.

220
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:25,307
That's so hot, I'm not
sure I can even handle it.

221
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:27,231
It'll be fun.

222
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,378
It's your worst nightmare.

223
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:30,668
Yeah. Whatever.

224
00:09:32,955 --> 00:09:34,635
We'll figure it out. Mmm-hmm.

225
00:09:41,097 --> 00:09:42,130
Don't move.

226
00:09:44,451 --> 00:09:46,284
Where's Bailey?

227
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:47,786
Henry doesn't need both of us,

228
00:09:47,854 --> 00:09:51,039
and we all agreed that
you'd be less of a hassle

229
00:09:51,108 --> 00:09:52,628
with the former
Chief of Surgery.

230
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:54,492
Nice. You're nice people.

231
00:09:54,561 --> 00:09:56,338
So are you planning to
get a look with contrast

232
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:57,607
or just the non-contrast study?

233
00:09:57,631 --> 00:09:58,631
Which would you prefer?

234
00:09:58,699 --> 00:09:59,847
Both.

235
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:01,882
Um, can you get
some contrast ready?

236
00:10:01,951 --> 00:10:03,296
Got it. Thanks.

237
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:07,038
Are you kidding me?

238
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:09,507
The ER. Owen wants a consult.

239
00:10:09,575 --> 00:10:11,292
Well, go ahead. It'll
take five minutes,

240
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,229
and we don't both need to
stand here watching the CT load.

241
00:10:15,098 --> 00:10:16,798
Are you sure?

242
00:10:16,867 --> 00:10:18,577
If you're not back in five, I'll find
you as soon as the film comes up.

243
00:10:18,601 --> 00:10:19,967
You will?

244
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:21,419
I said I would, didn't I?

245
00:10:23,573 --> 00:10:24,588
Thank you.

246
00:10:35,952 --> 00:10:37,385
Oh.

247
00:10:37,453 --> 00:10:38,920
Look at that.

248
00:10:39,873 --> 00:10:41,505
What the hell happened?

249
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:43,569
That's what I was gonna
ask you. She's in shock and...

250
00:10:43,593 --> 00:10:45,204
It looks like her
pericardium's full of blood.

251
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:47,228
She just had spinal
surgery. Why would she...

252
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,640
I was hoping you
would answer that.

253
00:10:48,664 --> 00:10:50,584
She's arresting.

254
00:10:51,968 --> 00:10:53,151
Uh...

255
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:55,548
All right. I'm gonna
do a thoracotomy.

256
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:58,673
Open up a chest tray.
Kepner, prep the chest.

257
00:10:58,742 --> 00:11:00,152
You're gonna crack her
chest? She's not a trauma.

258
00:11:00,176 --> 00:11:01,559
Yes, but she's dying.

259
00:11:14,391 --> 00:11:15,573
It's probably a mistake.

260
00:11:15,642 --> 00:11:17,976
You know, courts...
They screw up all the time.

261
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:19,310
You call 'em in the morning...

262
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:20,499
It's over, Alex.

263
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,475
It's been over for a
while. Everyone knew it.

264
00:11:22,499 --> 00:11:23,998
No one wants to say it.

265
00:11:27,037 --> 00:11:28,970
So get a surrogate or whatever.

266
00:11:29,038 --> 00:11:31,239
You can't just write off
having a family like that.

267
00:11:31,307 --> 00:11:32,568
Get Yang to carry a kid for you.

268
00:11:32,592 --> 00:11:33,786
She gets knocked
up at the drop of a...

269
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:35,221
If you don't shut up in
the next three seconds,

270
00:11:35,245 --> 00:11:37,405
I'm gonna shove you
out of the back of the rig.

271
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,452
What the hell is happening?

272
00:11:44,521 --> 00:11:45,832
What do we got? I
had to open her up.

273
00:11:45,856 --> 00:11:47,350
Her pericardium
is full of blood.

274
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:48,634
Ton of clots. Gunshot?

275
00:11:48,658 --> 00:11:50,492
No, she had spinal
fusion three days ago.

276
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,642
What?

277
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,005
I don't know. She has no history

278
00:11:53,029 --> 00:11:54,507
of heart disease
or risk factors.

279
00:11:54,531 --> 00:11:55,463
This is crazy. Could it be
a retrograde dissection?

280
00:11:55,532 --> 00:11:57,248
No, I don't think so.

281
00:11:57,316 --> 00:11:59,636
She has no history of Marfan's
or aortic widening on X-ray.

282
00:12:00,837 --> 00:12:01,997
Her heart's beating again.

283
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:03,432
All right, let's get
her upstairs now.

284
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:05,050
Throw a sterile towel
on her and move.

285
00:12:05,074 --> 00:12:06,218
All right, people. Let's go.

286
00:12:06,242 --> 00:12:07,419
I don't need you
in there. I'm good.

287
00:12:07,443 --> 00:12:08,905
Okay. Well, she's my patient.

288
00:12:08,929 --> 00:12:10,873
Did you cut her heart
open in your spinal fusion?

289
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:13,247
No. Then, she's my patient.

290
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:16,276
All right, Henry's in CT.
Somebody tell Webber where I am.

291
00:12:16,469 --> 00:12:17,602
Hold on.

292
00:12:21,174 --> 00:12:22,440
Teddy!

293
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:28,758
Right there. The bronchus.

294
00:12:28,782 --> 00:12:30,893
Judging by the ossification,
probably a carcinoid tumor.

295
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:32,511
Because of his tumor condition?

296
00:12:32,535 --> 00:12:34,130
Yeah, he's bleeding in
his lungs and trachea.

297
00:12:34,154 --> 00:12:35,681
Lexie's prepping him.
We're gonna take it out.

298
00:12:35,705 --> 00:12:36,982
You're gonna bronch
him and use a laser?

299
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:38,851
I was planning to open him up.

300
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:40,586
Take out the lung, resect
the tumor, put it back in.

301
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:42,888
A laser is less invasive, and
the recovery time is much faster.

302
00:12:42,912 --> 00:12:45,193
I hear that, but I've never
done one with a laser.

303
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:47,750
What?

304
00:12:47,817 --> 00:12:49,478
Not for this kind of procedure.

305
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:51,702
And I don't want my first
one to be on your husband.

306
00:12:52,121 --> 00:12:53,237
Well, I...

307
00:12:56,343 --> 00:12:57,458
Um...

308
00:13:00,313 --> 00:13:02,113
I think we should
get another surgeon.

309
00:13:10,323 --> 00:13:12,067
Cristina. No. Come on.

310
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:14,758
Taylor is on vacation.
Goldman is 45 minutes away.

311
00:13:14,828 --> 00:13:17,328
I did an endobronchial
tumor with Cristina last week

312
00:13:17,396 --> 00:13:18,562
with a laser.

313
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,059
I barely did a
thing. She did it all.

314
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:21,593
We've done three
in the last year.

315
00:13:21,617 --> 00:13:23,451
Teddy, it's just
too much pressure.

316
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:26,554
Now, she's a resident,
it's her mentor's husband.

317
00:13:26,622 --> 00:13:29,034
She's a machine. She
doesn't care if it's my husband.

318
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:31,087
No, she's not, and
we can get Rudzki.

319
00:13:31,111 --> 00:13:33,031
Rudzki's an ass,
and he's sloppy.

320
00:13:33,363 --> 00:13:34,862
Gown.

321
00:13:34,931 --> 00:13:37,171
I think we should reconsider
having Webber do this.

322
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,644
I don't have anything to prove.

323
00:13:38,668 --> 00:13:40,462
If I'm not state-of-the-art,
have Yang do it.

324
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:41,764
There's no question,
Henry's on his feet

325
00:13:41,788 --> 00:13:43,099
faster if we don't open him up.

326
00:13:43,123 --> 00:13:45,106
Cristina doesn't have
to know that it's Henry.

327
00:13:45,174 --> 00:13:47,275
Drape his face, don't
show her the chart,

328
00:13:47,343 --> 00:13:49,293
give her a verbal history.

329
00:13:49,362 --> 00:13:51,529
You put a bronchoscope
and a laser in her hand,

330
00:13:51,597 --> 00:13:54,248
she's not gonna ask for the
guy's name and a family photo.

331
00:13:54,317 --> 00:13:56,133
She is gonna cut.

332
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:58,246
You really think
this is a good idea?

333
00:13:58,270 --> 00:13:59,982
Look, I'll be there
the whole time.

334
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:02,902
If she has trouble, I'll go in and
open him up the old-fashioned way.

335
00:14:02,926 --> 00:14:04,408
Lap sponges, please.

336
00:14:04,477 --> 00:14:06,327
Owen? Is he scowling?

337
00:14:06,396 --> 00:14:07,812
Yeah. So am I.

338
00:14:07,881 --> 00:14:09,630
I don't like it either.

339
00:14:09,699 --> 00:14:11,276
Frankly, the only thing
that I'd be comfortable with

340
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:12,550
is doing it myself.

341
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:14,063
But since we all know that
that's not gonna happen,

342
00:14:14,087 --> 00:14:16,170
the next closest thing is Yang.

343
00:14:16,256 --> 00:14:19,056
She is the only one who
will do it the way I would.

344
00:14:23,263 --> 00:14:24,278
Fine.

345
00:14:24,347 --> 00:14:25,513
What'd he say?

346
00:14:25,582 --> 00:14:27,560
He said, "Fine." Thank you.

347
00:14:27,584 --> 00:14:29,533
Richard, watch her like a hawk.

348
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:32,063
If she screws this up, you're
gonna have to take out half his lung.

349
00:14:32,087 --> 00:14:33,982
And the last thing I need is to
have to explain to my husband

350
00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:35,806
why that happened.
I'll watch her.

351
00:14:35,842 --> 00:14:37,162
Cautery. Keep suctioning.

352
00:14:37,193 --> 00:14:38,404
You gotta get some
of those clots out.

353
00:14:38,428 --> 00:14:39,788
Okay. Good.

354
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:46,194
Hey, we're here to pick up a
newborn, take her to Seattle Grace.

355
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:47,585
You're looking for me.

356
00:14:47,654 --> 00:14:50,065
I'm Jordan Wagner. I am
really glad to see you guys.

357
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:51,756
Yeah, I'm Alex
Karev. Meredith Grey.

358
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:54,559
Okay. Listen, she
was born six hours ago,

359
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:56,338
right away, trouble breathing.

360
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:59,063
Stomach looked distended,
so we put down an NG tube.

361
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:01,293
But the X-ray showed that it
was just coiling in her chest.

362
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:02,762
We've done everything we
can to keep her breathing,

363
00:15:02,786 --> 00:15:03,829
but it's been a struggle.

364
00:15:03,853 --> 00:15:05,130
You don't have a neonatal mask?

365
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:07,514
We're not set up
for neonatal or OB.

366
00:15:07,557 --> 00:15:09,185
She was an emergency delivery,

367
00:15:09,209 --> 00:15:11,169
otherwise, we would've sent
her to the hospital in Leavenworth.

368
00:15:11,193 --> 00:15:13,561
Pulse ox is 79.
Respiratory rate is 80.

369
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:14,830
She's got retractions.

370
00:15:14,864 --> 00:15:15,941
How come she's not intubated?

371
00:15:15,965 --> 00:15:17,649
The smallest tube
we had didn't fit.

372
00:15:17,701 --> 00:15:19,445
Please tell me that you
brought a neonatal tube.

373
00:15:19,469 --> 00:15:21,964
We're gonna need X-ray in
here for a post-intubation film.

374
00:15:21,988 --> 00:15:23,538
This IV's no good.

375
00:15:23,606 --> 00:15:25,966
Yeah, you don't even have
a neonatal central line kit.

376
00:15:25,992 --> 00:15:27,024
No.

377
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:28,192
IO needle?

378
00:15:29,245 --> 00:15:30,344
No.

379
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:41,021
You will not call
Dr. Yang into the OR

380
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:42,774
until Henry is
intubated and draped.

381
00:15:42,842 --> 00:15:44,854
You will make sure to
drape every inch of his face.

382
00:15:44,878 --> 00:15:46,210
You will give a verbal history,

383
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:48,412
and you will simply
omit the patient's name.

384
00:15:48,481 --> 00:15:49,775
But Dr. Webber's
gonna be in there?

385
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:51,381
Yes. And he knows?

386
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,517
He knows, you know.
Dr. Yang does not.

387
00:15:53,586 --> 00:15:54,735
Can you handle this?

388
00:15:56,439 --> 00:15:57,822
You sure?

389
00:15:57,891 --> 00:16:00,085
Yeah. I mean, I'm gonna
be wearing a mask, right?

390
00:16:00,109 --> 00:16:03,694
I mean, as long as I don't
start giggling, then we're fine.

391
00:16:03,762 --> 00:16:04,912
Mmm-hmm.

392
00:16:14,774 --> 00:16:16,452
She doesn't want
any kids at all?

393
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:18,887
Zola was her baby. She
doesn't want another baby.

394
00:16:18,911 --> 00:16:21,128
She'll come around. She's
upset. Give her some time.

395
00:16:21,197 --> 00:16:22,563
I don't know.

396
00:16:22,632 --> 00:16:24,427
Look, if it doesn't work out,
you can always share Sofia.

397
00:16:24,451 --> 00:16:26,745
There's three of us parenting
her already. It kinda works.

398
00:16:26,769 --> 00:16:29,737
No one gets too exhausted,
you're not on every night.

399
00:16:29,806 --> 00:16:31,166
We can work you
into the rotation.

400
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:33,102
She's a baby. She's
not a time-share in Cabo.

401
00:16:33,126 --> 00:16:34,553
You're closed-minded.
That's your problem.

402
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:35,777
That's my problem?

403
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:37,928
Avery.

404
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,564
What's the deal?

405
00:16:39,632 --> 00:16:40,809
Nose is hanging off and
a lot of soft tissue loss.

406
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,416
Probably nerve damage.

407
00:16:42,485 --> 00:16:44,525
I'll let you know when
Dr. Robbins is ready for you.

408
00:16:46,806 --> 00:16:48,139
It's Karev.

409
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:49,367
How's it going?

410
00:16:49,391 --> 00:16:50,958
The kid's septic.
She's got pneumonia.

411
00:16:51,027 --> 00:16:52,571
<i>Was she intubated
when you got there?</i>

412
00:16:52,595 --> 00:16:55,213
Yeah, well, they don't have
any neonatal stuff here at all.

413
00:16:55,281 --> 00:16:57,760
<i>We intubated, we
started an umbilical line</i>

414
00:16:57,784 --> 00:17:00,251
to hang D10 normal
saline and antibiotics.

415
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,763
But her SATs aren't coming up,

416
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:03,415
and all the oxygen's
going into her stomach.

417
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:04,966
You're gonna need to
put in an Amplatz umbrella.

418
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:06,468
They don't have a 3-0 ET tube.

419
00:17:06,492 --> 00:17:07,720
You think they're
gonna have an Amplatz?

420
00:17:07,744 --> 00:17:08,987
All right. Elevate her head.

421
00:17:09,011 --> 00:17:10,344
All right. Get her head up.

422
00:17:10,412 --> 00:17:11,311
<i>All right, do they have
a Fogarty catheter?</i>

423
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:12,408
<i>They use those on grown-ups.</i>

424
00:17:12,432 --> 00:17:14,098
A Fogarty catheter?

425
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:15,666
Yeah, what else?

426
00:17:15,735 --> 00:17:17,229
You're gonna have to thread
the Fogarty down her trachea,

427
00:17:17,253 --> 00:17:18,881
pretty far down, then
blow up the balloon

428
00:17:18,905 --> 00:17:20,399
<i>and pull up until
you get traction.</i>

429
00:17:20,423 --> 00:17:22,767
That'll occlude the fistula and
get the air flowing into the lungs.

430
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,887
<i>You're gonna have to keep the
blind pouch clear on your way back.</i>

431
00:17:24,911 --> 00:17:26,055
And I'm not sure
you have anything

432
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,372
in your box that's
gonna do that.

433
00:17:27,396 --> 00:17:29,408
Uh, how about an 8
French suction catheter?

434
00:17:29,432 --> 00:17:30,681
<i>Yeah, that'll work.</i>

435
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,149
Got it. All right.

436
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:34,079
We're gonna call you
when we get to the rig.

437
00:17:34,103 --> 00:17:35,130
Hey, Alex. You don't have a
lot of time. You know that, right?

438
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:36,320
Yeah, I know that.

439
00:17:42,928 --> 00:17:44,362
Look at that.

440
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,525
There's a huge tear
in the left ventricle.

441
00:17:46,549 --> 00:17:48,316
Can you repair it?

442
00:17:48,384 --> 00:17:49,594
No, it's too big. We're
gonna have to go on bypass.

443
00:17:49,618 --> 00:17:50,963
Dr. Altman, I've
got your husband.

444
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:52,320
Oh, good.

445
00:17:52,388 --> 00:17:53,715
Henry. Hey, babe.

446
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:55,539
<i>I am so sorry.</i>

447
00:17:55,608 --> 00:17:57,452
<i>This woman's heart is
spouting like a fountain</i>

448
00:17:57,476 --> 00:17:58,642
<i>for no apparent reason.</i>

449
00:17:58,711 --> 00:18:00,244
That sounds like fun.

450
00:18:00,312 --> 00:18:01,990
Well, if there was any way I
could get out of here, I would.

451
00:18:02,014 --> 00:18:04,531
Stop worrying about it.
You can hold my hand

452
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,300
in post-op. You were such a wuss

453
00:18:06,368 --> 00:18:08,163
before my last surgery, it's
probably a good thing anyway.

454
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:09,981
Yeah, that wasn't my best work.

455
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:12,168
We're an old married couple now.

456
00:18:12,192 --> 00:18:14,625
You don't have to
drive me to the airport.

457
00:18:14,694 --> 00:18:16,738
You don't have to
walk me to the OR.

458
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,507
Well, I still want
rides to the airport.

459
00:18:18,531 --> 00:18:19,875
<i>That's 'cause you're
high maintenance.</i>

460
00:18:19,899 --> 00:18:22,016
You know it.

461
00:18:22,085 --> 00:18:24,185
Look, I'll see you after.

462
00:18:24,253 --> 00:18:26,165
Henry, don't ask
for extra morphine

463
00:18:26,189 --> 00:18:27,533
just 'cause you like the dreams.

464
00:18:27,557 --> 00:18:29,268
<i>Get back to work.</i> Love you.

465
00:18:29,292 --> 00:18:30,452
Yeah, you, too.

466
00:18:31,427 --> 00:18:32,427
I'm good.

467
00:18:33,562 --> 00:18:34,812
More sponges, please.

468
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,214
There aren't enough
sponges in the world.

469
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:38,549
Suction.

470
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:42,715
Must be hard for
her to be in the OR

471
00:18:42,739 --> 00:18:43,920
and not here with you.

472
00:18:48,678 --> 00:18:50,705
Can I tell you something
kind of embarrassing?

473
00:18:50,729 --> 00:18:51,729
Yeah.

474
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:53,898
I want to go to med school.

475
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:55,849
That's not embarrassing.

476
00:18:55,918 --> 00:18:57,579
I wouldn't exactly be the
youngest kid in my class.

477
00:18:57,603 --> 00:18:59,720
Yeah, but you'll be mature.

478
00:18:59,789 --> 00:19:00,988
You'll have perspective.

479
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:02,673
None of us had
that in our class.

480
00:19:02,742 --> 00:19:05,409
Teddy's not crazy
about the idea.

481
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:07,445
We kinda had

482
00:19:07,513 --> 00:19:09,307
a big fight about it right
before all this happened.

483
00:19:09,331 --> 00:19:11,665
Well, she might need some
time to get used to the idea.

484
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:14,234
None of this is very
easy on relationships.

485
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:15,853
You seem to do okay.

486
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:17,388
Jackson, right? He's great.

487
00:19:17,457 --> 00:19:19,923
Yeah. Though we're
not together anymore.

488
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,444
Oh. Um, Mark Sloan?

489
00:19:24,346 --> 00:19:25,629
We're not together either.

490
00:19:32,121 --> 00:19:33,982
So who's gonna
be operating on me?

491
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,439
Dr. Webber?

492
00:19:36,242 --> 00:19:37,625
I don't know.

493
00:19:43,816 --> 00:19:46,295
Hey. Teddy's got a patient
with an endobronchial carcinoid.

494
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:47,996
She wants you
to take care of it.

495
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,248
Now? Yes.

496
00:19:49,272 --> 00:19:51,054
Why can't she do it herself?

497
00:19:51,123 --> 00:19:53,602
Well, she's working on a woman
who almost bled out in the ER.

498
00:19:53,626 --> 00:19:55,826
So, she can't do it.

499
00:19:55,894 --> 00:19:58,028
Well, how about Goldman?

500
00:19:58,097 --> 00:20:01,599
She's giving you a chance to
fly solo on a major procedure.

501
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:04,018
I know, but we just
did a similar one.

502
00:20:04,086 --> 00:20:05,798
I basically handled
the whole thing myself

503
00:20:05,822 --> 00:20:07,532
while she planned the
menu for what sounded like

504
00:20:07,556 --> 00:20:09,056
a really boring brunch.

505
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:10,836
And I'm supposed to do my
first Bentall procedure tomorrow.

506
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:11,959
It's from my bucket list.

507
00:20:12,028 --> 00:20:13,322
I'm practicing the
steps. You want to see?

508
00:20:13,346 --> 00:20:16,063
Okay, drop the damn
suture and go scrub. All right?

509
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:17,915
Okay. Relax.

510
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:21,430
This better be fast. I
want to be fresh tomorrow.

511
00:20:21,454 --> 00:20:22,703
Cristina, this is emergent.

512
00:20:22,772 --> 00:20:24,088
Yeah, I'm going.

513
00:20:24,157 --> 00:20:25,734
I'm just saying, I'm
glad she likes me,

514
00:20:25,758 --> 00:20:28,036
but if she's gonna call me
every time she has a procedure

515
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,761
she doesn't feel like doing...
I mean, I'm not her valet.

516
00:20:49,131 --> 00:20:51,231
Maybe it's not the end.

517
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,778
You'll call the
lawyers in the morning.

518
00:20:52,802 --> 00:20:54,412
And maybe there's something
else you guys can do.

519
00:20:54,436 --> 00:20:56,136
Meredith didn't want kids.

520
00:20:56,205 --> 00:20:58,772
I pushed her. She
opened herself up.

521
00:21:00,042 --> 00:21:01,808
Now, I feel like

522
00:21:02,444 --> 00:21:04,144
I did this to her.

523
00:21:04,213 --> 00:21:05,713
She wanted it, too,

524
00:21:05,781 --> 00:21:06,992
or it wouldn't have happened.

525
00:21:07,016 --> 00:21:09,283
She'll blame me,

526
00:21:09,352 --> 00:21:12,052
like I've been blaming her.

527
00:21:12,121 --> 00:21:13,954
We lost Zola, and
now if I lose Meredith...

528
00:21:14,023 --> 00:21:16,022
She always comes back.

529
00:21:16,091 --> 00:21:19,025
She might need a
minute to back away, but

530
00:21:19,829 --> 00:21:21,361
she comes back.

531
00:21:28,654 --> 00:21:30,921
Try this patch on the tear.

532
00:21:30,989 --> 00:21:32,734
We're gonna have
to cut it to size.

533
00:21:32,758 --> 00:21:33,908
Hang on.

534
00:21:33,976 --> 00:21:37,278
Sorry. My glove is
stuck on something.

535
00:21:37,346 --> 00:21:38,678
I'm taking my hand out.

536
00:21:38,748 --> 00:21:40,264
What happened?

537
00:21:41,534 --> 00:21:42,899
There's a hole in my glove.

538
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:44,208
You're kidding.

539
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:46,131
Can we get Dr. Kepner
a new glove, please?

540
00:21:46,155 --> 00:21:47,337
Right away.

541
00:21:48,057 --> 00:21:49,456
Did it break the skin?

542
00:21:49,525 --> 00:21:50,690
No. I think I'm fine.

543
00:21:50,759 --> 00:21:52,559
Here you go. Thanks.

544
00:21:55,398 --> 00:21:56,847
My God.

545
00:21:57,683 --> 00:21:59,583
What the hell is that?

546
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:07,558
Dr. Yang.

547
00:22:07,626 --> 00:22:09,442
We just started
the bronchoscopy.

548
00:22:09,511 --> 00:22:10,889
Looking forward
to seeing your work.

549
00:22:10,913 --> 00:22:12,040
Hopefully I'll learn
a thing or two.

550
00:22:12,064 --> 00:22:13,464
It's an honor, sir.

551
00:22:13,533 --> 00:22:16,416
Uh, 35-year-old male,
endobronchial carcinoid tumor

552
00:22:16,485 --> 00:22:18,180
presented with
active hemoptysis.

553
00:22:18,204 --> 00:22:21,756
He's been given two liters
LR and a unit of packed cells.

554
00:22:22,825 --> 00:22:23,957
Okay.

555
00:22:24,043 --> 00:22:26,493
So we'll resect
with the CO2 laser.

556
00:22:26,562 --> 00:22:27,894
Is it ready to go?

557
00:22:28,364 --> 00:22:29,430
Yes.

558
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,060
You know, I think
I'm gonna time myself.

559
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:33,784
Last time I did
this, it took me, like,

560
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:35,485
two and a half
hours, skin to skin.

561
00:22:35,555 --> 00:22:37,120
That's too long.

562
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:39,702
I think I get hypnotized when I
watch that laser or something.

563
00:22:39,726 --> 00:22:41,152
We should be able to get
it down to, like, two hours.

564
00:22:41,176 --> 00:22:42,921
Let's start the
timer for Dr. Yang.

565
00:22:42,945 --> 00:22:44,078
Okay, laser, please.

566
00:22:52,538 --> 00:22:53,920
Is that them?

567
00:22:53,989 --> 00:22:56,339
Wait. I'm coming with you.

568
00:22:57,142 --> 00:22:58,809
Dana?

569
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:00,005
Why is she out here?

570
00:23:00,029 --> 00:23:01,846
She said if I didn't
take her, she'd walk.

571
00:23:01,914 --> 00:23:03,647
I was afraid she'd try it.

572
00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:05,766
Please let me come with her.

573
00:23:05,835 --> 00:23:08,368
Dana, you just had surgery,

574
00:23:08,437 --> 00:23:09,882
and you've lost a lot of blood.

575
00:23:09,906 --> 00:23:11,972
I'll be fine. Please.

576
00:23:12,041 --> 00:23:13,869
I need you to take
care of yourself.

577
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:16,133
These guys, they're the best.

578
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:18,361
She is in great hands.

579
00:23:20,099 --> 00:23:21,832
Please.

580
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:23,300
She's my baby.

581
00:23:23,368 --> 00:23:25,268
We're supposed to be together.

582
00:23:25,337 --> 00:23:27,421
I can't leave her.
She's so little.

583
00:23:28,107 --> 00:23:29,323
Please.

584
00:23:29,391 --> 00:23:31,842
I have to be with her.
Please let me go with her.

585
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:33,889
I'm Dr. Grey. And
that's Dr. Karev.

586
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:35,479
And we're gonna
take your daughter

587
00:23:35,548 --> 00:23:37,188
to the best baby
surgeon there is.

588
00:23:38,134 --> 00:23:40,000
She doesn't even
have a name yet.

589
00:23:40,069 --> 00:23:41,546
Well, you're gonna give her
one when you come to Seattle

590
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:42,764
and hold her in your arms.

591
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:45,038
And until that time, I'm
gonna take care of her.

592
00:23:45,858 --> 00:23:47,257
You hear me?

593
00:23:49,045 --> 00:23:50,410
I have her.

594
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:52,078
Okay?

595
00:24:05,778 --> 00:24:06,778
What happened?

596
00:24:06,846 --> 00:24:08,545
Show her the tray.

597
00:24:11,683 --> 00:24:15,386
That's the screw that I just
pulled out of your patient.

598
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:16,821
It was stabbing her heart,

599
00:24:16,889 --> 00:24:19,534
slicing into cardiac muscle
every time the heart tried to beat.

600
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:21,986
This thing looks like
hamburger meat right about now.

601
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:23,026
Oh, my God.

602
00:24:23,078 --> 00:24:25,518
You want to tell me
how this happened?

603
00:24:36,292 --> 00:24:37,975
You know, why not
try adoption again?

604
00:24:38,044 --> 00:24:40,277
Social services just
took our kid away.

605
00:24:40,346 --> 00:24:42,107
What do you think, if we
wait a week, they'll forget

606
00:24:42,131 --> 00:24:43,775
and give us another
try with a new kid?

607
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:45,632
All right. So get a surrogate.

608
00:24:45,701 --> 00:24:47,184
Alex. Why not?

609
00:24:47,252 --> 00:24:49,197
Because I don't
want a surrogate.

610
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:50,281
Okay? Just drop it.

611
00:24:50,305 --> 00:24:52,356
No. You just don't
give up like that.

612
00:24:52,425 --> 00:24:55,187
It's nice that you care, but it
really isn't any of your business.

613
00:24:55,211 --> 00:24:56,977
It is. It's my fault.

614
00:24:57,046 --> 00:24:59,596
I can't handle being responsible
for you not having kids.

615
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:00,764
It's too much.

616
00:25:01,433 --> 00:25:03,233
It's not your fault.

617
00:25:03,302 --> 00:25:04,501
Yeah, it is.

618
00:25:06,455 --> 00:25:08,288
No, it's my fault.

619
00:25:08,357 --> 00:25:10,569
I got the ball rolling. I
messed with the trial.

620
00:25:10,593 --> 00:25:12,913
What you did was turdy,
but what I did was illegal.

621
00:25:12,978 --> 00:25:14,812
Who cares? You
just don't give up.

622
00:25:14,881 --> 00:25:17,298
It's lame. You're not a
quitter. That's not who you are.

623
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:25,939
Dude, what's the problem?

624
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:32,507
I'm kind of in the
middle of a surgery.

625
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:34,076
No, here's what
you're in the middle of.

626
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,665
The surgery on Laura Lewis,

627
00:25:35,734 --> 00:25:37,579
where I supervised you
inserting pedicle screws

628
00:25:37,603 --> 00:25:39,214
and a plate to
stabilize T6 to T8?

629
00:25:39,238 --> 00:25:40,304
Yeah?

630
00:25:40,373 --> 00:25:41,850
One of them's
stabbing her in the heart.

631
00:25:41,874 --> 00:25:43,407
She's half dead,

632
00:25:43,475 --> 00:25:45,715
and we're about to
go tell her husband.

633
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:55,085
So using a laser's
not much different

634
00:25:55,154 --> 00:25:57,388
than a normal
bronchoscopic resection?

635
00:25:57,456 --> 00:25:58,989
<i>Uh, yes.</i>

636
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:00,335
<i>You just have to
be extra careful</i>

637
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:01,803
<i>with hidden vascular structures</i>

638
00:26:01,827 --> 00:26:03,488
<i>when using this
high a level of energy.</i>

639
00:26:03,512 --> 00:26:05,073
<i>But you're forming
an eschar as you go,</i>

640
00:26:05,097 --> 00:26:07,464
<i>so the blood's
coagulating along the way.</i>

641
00:26:07,533 --> 00:26:08,533
Pretty much.

642
00:26:08,601 --> 00:26:09,841
That is pretty handy.

643
00:26:10,852 --> 00:26:13,170
Okay. What happened?

644
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:15,272
<i>Ugh! I must have
nicked a vessel.</i>

645
00:26:16,508 --> 00:26:17,575
Pressure's dropping.

646
00:26:17,643 --> 00:26:19,187
Okay, so I'm giving
it more irrigation.

647
00:26:19,211 --> 00:26:20,971
Ah, the whole field's obscured.

648
00:26:31,924 --> 00:26:33,068
What happened to the engine?

649
00:26:33,092 --> 00:26:34,692
I don't know
what the crap it is.

650
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,738
I called for another unit, but
we're in the middle of nowhere.

651
00:26:36,762 --> 00:26:37,828
It's gonna take forever.

652
00:26:37,896 --> 00:26:39,507
I'm putting these out,
and I'm gonna run back.

653
00:26:39,531 --> 00:26:40,709
It looked like there was a store

654
00:26:40,733 --> 00:26:42,210
or something about
half a mile back.

655
00:26:42,234 --> 00:26:44,012
Maybe they got a truck.
You gotta get out of the rig.

656
00:26:44,036 --> 00:26:45,480
It's pouring rain and freezing.

657
00:26:45,504 --> 00:26:47,249
We can't go out
there with the baby.

658
00:26:47,273 --> 00:26:49,701
There's no shoulder. It's not like
we can just take the incubator out.

659
00:26:49,725 --> 00:26:51,136
I mean, there's not
even anywhere to stand.

660
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,637
This thing is full
of oxygen tanks.

661
00:26:52,661 --> 00:26:54,689
We get hit, it'll go up
like a Roman candle.

662
00:26:54,713 --> 00:26:56,491
You gotta get out.
And leave the baby?

663
00:26:56,515 --> 00:26:58,143
She'll die. You want to all die?

664
00:26:58,167 --> 00:27:00,378
I'm putting these out. You
better hope people can see 'em.

665
00:27:00,402 --> 00:27:02,152
You're on a hill and
you're on a curve.

666
00:27:02,221 --> 00:27:04,261
I'm telling you, get
out the damn rig.

667
00:27:16,035 --> 00:27:17,451
Hey, you need some help?

668
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:18,868
Why?

669
00:27:18,937 --> 00:27:20,282
Well, his pressure dropped out.

670
00:27:20,306 --> 00:27:22,138
Oh, there was a
nick in an artery.

671
00:27:22,207 --> 00:27:24,402
I cauterized, and his
pressure came back up.

672
00:27:24,426 --> 00:27:27,444
Okay, but what if it
was a carcinoid crisis?

673
00:27:27,513 --> 00:27:28,929
Uh, I doubt it.

674
00:27:28,997 --> 00:27:30,475
But if his pressure
drops out again,

675
00:27:30,499 --> 00:27:31,927
I'll think about a
dose of octreotide.

676
00:27:31,951 --> 00:27:33,667
Cristina... I'm on a clock,

677
00:27:33,736 --> 00:27:35,747
and you're wasting my
time. What is your problem?

678
00:27:35,771 --> 00:27:38,671
Cristina, there's a
patient on the table.

679
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,952
Let go of the clock and
focus on what you're doing.

680
00:27:40,976 --> 00:27:43,159
I am focused.

681
00:27:43,228 --> 00:27:44,494
I'd focus a whole lot better

682
00:27:44,563 --> 00:27:47,130
if you weren't standing
here with your pants on fire.

683
00:27:49,802 --> 00:27:51,035
We've got it, Dr. Hunt.

684
00:27:58,627 --> 00:28:01,694
Apparently, one of the screws
we placed in her spine came loose.

685
00:28:01,764 --> 00:28:03,808
It could be that the bone isn't
strong enough to hold the screw.

686
00:28:03,832 --> 00:28:05,999
But at this point,
we don't know.

687
00:28:06,068 --> 00:28:08,148
Okay, and so what, it just...

688
00:28:08,187 --> 00:28:09,414
And so, the screw,

689
00:28:09,438 --> 00:28:10,820
it cut into her heart?

690
00:28:10,889 --> 00:28:12,789
Dr. Altman's repairing
her heart right now,

691
00:28:12,858 --> 00:28:15,008
and she's an incredible surgeon.

692
00:28:15,077 --> 00:28:17,060
But we won't know for a while

693
00:28:17,129 --> 00:28:18,678
exactly what the situation is.

694
00:28:19,965 --> 00:28:23,133
Situation? I don't understand.

695
00:28:23,202 --> 00:28:24,401
Where's my mama?

696
00:28:27,355 --> 00:28:28,554
Buddy.

697
00:28:29,641 --> 00:28:31,274
Come here.

698
00:28:44,756 --> 00:28:46,457
Look at that.

699
00:28:46,525 --> 00:28:47,602
Very nice.

700
00:28:47,626 --> 00:28:48,892
Right?

701
00:28:48,961 --> 00:28:51,595
If I do say so myself.

702
00:28:51,663 --> 00:28:53,343
Hang on. We've
got some bleeding.

703
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:56,066
Okay, you have some
clots blocking your scope.

704
00:28:56,134 --> 00:28:58,969
Why don't you take out your
laser and pass a brush through it?

705
00:28:59,021 --> 00:29:00,870
Okay. Okay.

706
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:02,617
SATs are down to 88.

707
00:29:02,641 --> 00:29:04,485
Okay, I'm gonna
have to open him up.

708
00:29:04,509 --> 00:29:05,971
Just let me just try this first.

709
00:29:05,995 --> 00:29:09,196
Yang! Yang, you have blood
coming in through the ET tube.

710
00:29:09,264 --> 00:29:10,308
Get outta there.

711
00:29:10,332 --> 00:29:11,431
I can clear the field...

712
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,600
Get his chest ready,
Grey. We're going in.

713
00:29:13,668 --> 00:29:15,052
Okay, okay, I'm pulling out.

714
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:26,630
10-blade.

715
00:29:26,699 --> 00:29:27,898
10-blade.

716
00:29:34,907 --> 00:29:37,207
Find all the films,
pre-op, post-op.

717
00:29:37,276 --> 00:29:38,992
You go over every
inch of every image,

718
00:29:39,061 --> 00:29:41,356
and assuming she survives, you
get a CT to check the hardware

719
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,746
and run a bone density test,

720
00:29:42,814 --> 00:29:44,854
so we can get a clue as
to what the hell went wrong.

721
00:29:45,767 --> 00:29:47,483
I, uh...

722
00:29:47,552 --> 00:29:50,192
I'm so sorry. I have to
go, Dr. Torres. I'm sorry.

723
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:52,939
What?

724
00:29:54,376 --> 00:29:56,609
Avery put pedicle screws in
a woman's spine this week,

725
00:29:56,678 --> 00:29:58,022
and one of them turned out to be

726
00:29:58,046 --> 00:29:59,612
tearing holes in
her left ventricle.

727
00:29:59,681 --> 00:30:00,813
Whoa!

728
00:30:00,883 --> 00:30:02,899
I can't even breathe right now.

729
00:30:02,951 --> 00:30:04,496
Yeah, well, come
on. It's part of the deal.

730
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,464
We have to let students operate.

731
00:30:06,488 --> 00:30:08,568
They don't always get it right.

732
00:30:09,091 --> 00:30:10,340
I was reading a magazine.

733
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:12,725
Hey, come on.

734
00:30:12,794 --> 00:30:15,145
Now don't beat
yourself up. We all do it.

735
00:30:15,214 --> 00:30:16,894
I know what J.Lo wore
to the coffeehouse.

736
00:30:16,949 --> 00:30:18,909
That's what I was doing. Shh.

737
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:24,733
Vascular clamp.

738
00:30:24,757 --> 00:30:26,434
He is losing way too
much blood way too fast.

739
00:30:26,458 --> 00:30:28,052
Okay, put the blood
on a rapid infuser

740
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:29,637
and get me another
two units up here.

741
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:31,106
Right away. He's
really bradycardic.

742
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:33,557
Okay, let's push
one atropine. Now.

743
00:30:33,581 --> 00:30:35,565
Uh, hold on. Wait, wait, wait.

744
00:30:35,634 --> 00:30:38,554
This tumor has eroded right
through the pulmonary artery.

745
00:30:39,705 --> 00:30:41,338
Damn it.

746
00:30:41,407 --> 00:30:42,522
Let me see.

747
00:30:43,259 --> 00:30:44,357
Sir.

748
00:30:47,762 --> 00:30:49,379
Okay. Let's clamp the hilum.

749
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:54,178
He's already lost half his blood
volume. This lung is like a sieve.

750
00:30:54,202 --> 00:30:55,685
Give me bovie.

751
00:30:55,754 --> 00:30:58,688
We're maxed out on
dopamine, maxed out on norepi.

752
00:30:58,757 --> 00:31:01,724
Sir, I'm not sure
what we do next.

753
00:31:01,793 --> 00:31:03,121
V-fib.

754
00:31:03,145 --> 00:31:04,594
Okay, push one of epi. Now.

755
00:31:04,663 --> 00:31:06,129
I'm gonna start compressions.

756
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:07,881
Let's get this outta here.

757
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:09,315
Come on, people.

758
00:31:10,585 --> 00:31:12,235
Okay, here we go.

759
00:31:20,245 --> 00:31:21,511
Come on.

760
00:31:27,052 --> 00:31:28,185
Look at that.

761
00:31:28,253 --> 00:31:30,098
His nose is gonna be perfect.

762
00:31:30,122 --> 00:31:31,362
This is gonna be beautiful.

763
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:32,539
If you do say so yourself.

764
00:31:34,292 --> 00:31:37,138
I offered to time-share
Sofia with Derek and Meredith

765
00:31:37,162 --> 00:31:39,440
if they don't end up
with kids of their own.

766
00:31:39,464 --> 00:31:41,475
He said, "No." Why?

767
00:31:41,499 --> 00:31:43,244
Because your child
is not a rental car.

768
00:31:43,268 --> 00:31:44,812
We're not gonna take
her out one week a month.

769
00:31:44,836 --> 00:31:46,914
Have you seen her? 'Cause
she's heart-stoppingly adorable.

770
00:31:46,938 --> 00:31:48,950
You're missing the point.
He's missing the point.

771
00:31:48,974 --> 00:31:50,568
No, she's delicious.
She's addictive.

772
00:31:50,592 --> 00:31:52,486
Why wouldn't you want
to parent her? I just find...

773
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:54,005
Ambulance broke down,
like, in the middle of the road.

774
00:31:54,029 --> 00:31:55,373
They can't move.
They can't get out.

775
00:31:55,397 --> 00:31:56,463
Did they send a backup?

776
00:31:56,532 --> 00:31:57,642
It's coming, but it's slow.

777
00:31:57,666 --> 00:31:59,310
Put her on speakerphone. Yeah.

778
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:00,945
Alex? ALEX: <i>We can't move.</i>

779
00:32:00,969 --> 00:32:02,113
<i>We're a friggin' sitting duck.</i>

780
00:32:02,137 --> 00:32:03,631
<i>We... The...</i>

781
00:32:03,655 --> 00:32:05,416
All right, hold on. I can't
hear you. Say that again.

782
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,917
<i>We gotta take the
baby out of here,</i>

783
00:32:06,941 --> 00:32:08,903
<i>but the two of us can't
move the damn incubator</i>

784
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:10,238
<i>and all this crap on a highway.</i>

785
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:12,011
Did you set up the flares?

786
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,142
Okay, leave the phone. See if
you can get a helicopter up there.

787
00:32:14,166 --> 00:32:15,366
Yeah. Take this?

788
00:32:24,343 --> 00:32:25,908
Sir, it's been 20 minutes.

789
00:32:25,977 --> 00:32:29,179
There's no way that
heart's coming back.

790
00:32:29,248 --> 00:32:32,368
Sir, there's no blood left to
circulate. I'm not sure what you're...

791
00:32:52,187 --> 00:32:55,505
Um, time of death, 8:52 p.m.

792
00:32:58,677 --> 00:33:01,577
There was no way to take
it out without killing him.

793
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:03,291
And there's no way
he could've lived with it

794
00:33:03,315 --> 00:33:04,981
in him for much longer.

795
00:33:09,287 --> 00:33:11,187
Well, I'll write the op note.

796
00:33:11,256 --> 00:33:14,824
But if you can add a few
lines that make it clear

797
00:33:14,893 --> 00:33:17,060
that I didn't come up
with the treatment plan.

798
00:33:17,129 --> 00:33:18,728
It's a bad outcome,

799
00:33:18,797 --> 00:33:21,497
and I don't want to take the
heat for it in my fifth-year boards.

800
00:33:24,102 --> 00:33:25,585
It was Dr. Altman's idea.

801
00:33:37,582 --> 00:33:40,417
Oh. Hey.

802
00:33:40,485 --> 00:33:42,814
The tumor eroded right
through the pulmonary artery.

803
00:33:42,838 --> 00:33:44,032
The guy bled right out.

804
00:33:44,056 --> 00:33:45,934
We were done before we started.

805
00:33:45,958 --> 00:33:47,823
Is there, um,

806
00:33:47,892 --> 00:33:51,845
a family or something
we need to, uh, talk to?

807
00:34:55,944 --> 00:34:57,705
Secure the umbilical
line with extra tape.

808
00:34:57,729 --> 00:34:59,696
You need the D10.

809
00:34:59,765 --> 00:35:01,559
Put the oxygen tank in the
holster and take the paramedic kit.

810
00:35:01,583 --> 00:35:02,882
Get out of the rig.

811
00:35:02,951 --> 00:35:04,395
Swaddle her so
that she stays warm.

812
00:35:04,419 --> 00:35:05,846
<i>We can't regulate...</i>

813
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:06,986
What?

814
00:35:07,055 --> 00:35:08,799
<i>We can't regulate her
temp without the incubator.</i>

815
00:35:08,823 --> 00:35:10,201
They may have to leave the kid.

816
00:35:10,225 --> 00:35:11,703
<i>We are not leaving the baby.</i>

817
00:35:11,727 --> 00:35:13,705
At least one of you
should get out of the rig.

818
00:35:13,729 --> 00:35:15,428
What are they
gonna do, flip a coin?

819
00:35:15,496 --> 00:35:17,075
They're sitting in a powder keg.

820
00:35:17,099 --> 00:35:18,409
Get out. Alex...

821
00:35:18,433 --> 00:35:20,377
Go. There's no reason
for both of us to get killed.

822
00:35:20,401 --> 00:35:22,530
Well, I'm not safer in the
middle of the damn road.

823
00:35:22,554 --> 00:35:24,048
I'm telling you to get
out of the damn rig.

824
00:35:24,072 --> 00:35:26,089
Alex, if you want to go, you go.

825
00:35:26,157 --> 00:35:27,702
We're not gonna fix your guilt

826
00:35:27,726 --> 00:35:29,686
by me letting you die in
an ambulance so that I...

827
00:36:02,978 --> 00:36:06,229
Is it possible the bone was
intact when they closed, and then...

828
00:36:06,298 --> 00:36:08,742
And what, it just fell apart
in the last couple of days?

829
00:36:08,766 --> 00:36:10,444
I don't know how you don't check

830
00:36:10,468 --> 00:36:13,708
if a vertebra is compromised
before you drop a screw in it.

831
00:36:14,673 --> 00:36:16,839
Hey. How's it going with Henry?

832
00:36:16,908 --> 00:36:18,241
They're done.

833
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:19,609
You almost finished here?

834
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:21,177
It's gonna be a while.

835
00:36:21,246 --> 00:36:24,447
Torres missed a loose
screw in this woman's spine.

836
00:36:24,516 --> 00:36:26,461
It tore apart her
whole left ventricle.

837
00:36:26,485 --> 00:36:29,781
I've never seen anything
like it. I put in a patch.

838
00:36:29,805 --> 00:36:33,117
I've still gotta reinforce
it with a muscle flap.

839
00:36:33,141 --> 00:36:34,874
It's a mess.

840
00:36:34,943 --> 00:36:38,072
Hey, will you check on Henry
and see if he's feeling okay?

841
00:36:38,096 --> 00:36:40,129
I told him I would
be in post-op.

842
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:42,566
And I wasn't in
pre-op. I'm a bad wife.

843
00:36:42,634 --> 00:36:45,718
I'll take over here.
You can go out.

844
00:36:45,787 --> 00:36:49,872
All due respect, but
you are out of your depth.

845
00:36:52,076 --> 00:36:54,594
Why does your
face look like that?

846
00:36:54,663 --> 00:36:57,947
Uh, there was a... Ambulance
broke down on route 2,

847
00:36:58,016 --> 00:36:59,949
so we lost contact.

848
00:37:00,018 --> 00:37:03,870
Oh, I hope everyone's
all right. Route 2 at night?

849
00:37:03,938 --> 00:37:06,378
Awful. Going over
those mountains?

850
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:09,525
So, Henry

851
00:37:09,594 --> 00:37:12,095
wants to go to med
school. Can you believe it?

852
00:37:13,849 --> 00:37:15,147
No.

853
00:37:15,216 --> 00:37:17,717
I mean, I squashed
the idea like a bug,

854
00:37:17,786 --> 00:37:19,930
which I feel awful about,
but I mean, come on.

855
00:37:19,954 --> 00:37:21,921
I mean, a med
student at his age?

856
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:25,310
That's crazy, right? Or
am I just a terrible person?

857
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:26,893
No.

858
00:37:26,961 --> 00:37:29,512
No, I'm not, or it's not crazy?

859
00:37:29,564 --> 00:37:31,831
The patch isn't holding.

860
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:33,311
We cannot get a break here.

861
00:37:33,335 --> 00:37:36,068
All right, let's try a pledget.

862
00:37:36,137 --> 00:37:39,189
Check on him, let me know
how he's feeling, would you?

863
00:37:40,858 --> 00:37:42,008
Yeah, of course.

864
00:37:42,077 --> 00:37:44,088
And, you know, if you get bored,

865
00:37:44,112 --> 00:37:47,430
I mean, you could mention
that med school is a long haul,

866
00:37:47,499 --> 00:37:49,277
and, you know,
he may want to try

867
00:37:49,301 --> 00:37:51,029
to get a degree
in something else.

868
00:37:51,053 --> 00:37:54,604
And he's a real
stoner on Dilaudid.

869
00:37:54,672 --> 00:37:57,140
So don't be surprised if
he compliments your eyes.

870
00:38:18,947 --> 00:38:20,387
I just spoke to
emergency dispatch.

871
00:38:20,449 --> 00:38:22,048
Another ambulance is coming now.

872
00:38:22,117 --> 00:38:23,227
The cops are a few minutes out,

873
00:38:23,251 --> 00:38:24,595
and the helicopter
wouldn't be any faster

874
00:38:24,619 --> 00:38:25,663
since they leave
out of Skykomish.

875
00:38:25,687 --> 00:38:27,603
Are we still on speaker or what?

876
00:38:27,672 --> 00:38:30,840
We were talking to them, and
there was a loud noise and...

877
00:38:31,876 --> 00:38:32,956
We lost them.

878
00:38:35,931 --> 00:38:37,597
Avery,

879
00:38:37,665 --> 00:38:39,177
Dr. Shepherd's gonna
put down his instruments,

880
00:38:39,201 --> 00:38:41,362
and you're gonna
step in for him.

881
00:38:41,386 --> 00:38:44,906
Fancy part's over. We'll
walk you through the rest.

882
00:38:45,039 --> 00:38:46,088
Derek.

883
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:52,361
All right.

884
00:38:53,698 --> 00:38:55,297
It's not right.

885
00:38:55,366 --> 00:38:58,118
Who's gonna take over
in the middle of a bypass?

886
00:38:58,186 --> 00:39:00,548
There's a woman on the table who
dies if Teddy walks out of that OR.

887
00:39:00,572 --> 00:39:01,887
It's her husband, Richard.

888
00:39:01,956 --> 00:39:04,140
Another hour isn't
gonna change anything.

889
00:39:04,208 --> 00:39:05,419
Goldman's on his
way. Tell her then.

890
00:39:05,443 --> 00:39:07,376
She's my friend.

891
00:39:07,445 --> 00:39:10,279
You're not her friend right
now. You're the Chief of Surgery.

892
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:12,708
If she finds out that I waited,
she will never forgive me.

893
00:39:14,368 --> 00:39:16,552
Her husband just died in our OR.

894
00:39:18,706 --> 00:39:20,866
She'll never forgive any of us.

895
00:39:24,078 --> 00:39:25,378
Hunt.

896
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:27,225
Meredith and Alex are
trapped in an ambulance

897
00:39:27,249 --> 00:39:28,576
in the middle of
the highway. I know.

898
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,010
We just lost contact.
I think they got hit.

899
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:32,830
We need to get emergency
dispatch on the phone.

900
00:39:35,907 --> 00:39:37,240
What is it?

901
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:40,259
What?

902
00:39:40,328 --> 00:39:42,795
All right. The ventricular
laceration is still bleeding.

903
00:39:43,665 --> 00:39:45,798
We need more volume.

904
00:39:45,867 --> 00:39:47,767
We need some more
blood. Right away.

905
00:39:47,836 --> 00:39:49,012
She's dropping again.

906
00:39:49,036 --> 00:39:51,804
Come on, Laura. You
gotta pull it together.

907
00:39:54,325 --> 00:39:56,943
Okay, good. There
we go, 90 over 60.

908
00:39:57,012 --> 00:39:59,312
Good. Hello again.
How's he doing?

909
00:39:59,381 --> 00:40:02,782
Uh, he's fine. Woozy.
Vitals are good.

910
00:40:02,850 --> 00:40:04,629
Did they run a post-op CT?

911
00:40:04,653 --> 00:40:06,102
Not yet.

912
00:40:06,171 --> 00:40:08,299
But Cristina felt she
got clean margins?

913
00:40:08,323 --> 00:40:09,522
Oh, yes.

914
00:40:11,626 --> 00:40:14,727
Did she figure it out, who
she was operating on?

915
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:17,280
No.

916
00:40:17,348 --> 00:40:19,082
See? I told you.

917
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:22,485
Sometimes her lack of interest
in the patient as a human being

918
00:40:22,554 --> 00:40:24,254
can come in handy.

919
00:40:24,322 --> 00:40:27,367
Did you mention the
med school thing to Henry?

920
00:40:27,391 --> 00:40:28,691
No.

921
00:40:29,744 --> 00:40:31,744
You're a coward.

922
00:40:31,813 --> 00:40:34,341
You know, if you think you
are off the hook, you are wrong.

923
00:40:34,365 --> 00:40:36,911
I mean, this could ruin the
next five to 10 years of my life.

924
00:40:36,935 --> 00:40:38,735
You do understand that, right?

925
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:41,237
<i>These are the things we beg for,</i>

926
00:40:41,306 --> 00:40:42,939
<i>a root canal,</i>

927
00:40:43,007 --> 00:40:45,140
<i>an IRS audit,</i>

928
00:40:45,209 --> 00:40:47,977
<i>coffee spilled on our clothes.</i>

929
00:40:48,045 --> 00:40:50,596
<i>When the really
terrible things happen,</i>

930
00:40:50,665 --> 00:40:52,776
<i>we start begging a
god we don't believe in</i>

931
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,201
<i>to bring back the little horrors</i>

932
00:40:55,270 --> 00:40:57,353
<i>and take away this.</i>

933
00:41:02,927 --> 00:41:04,060
Are you okay?

934
00:41:04,846 --> 00:41:06,245
You're bleeding.

935
00:41:10,869 --> 00:41:11,901
Mer, what are you doing?

936
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:14,220
Get me a blanket.
I'm taking her out.

937
00:41:16,424 --> 00:41:18,091
Mer, put her back in.

938
00:41:18,176 --> 00:41:20,309
She just got thrown
around a plastic box.

939
00:41:20,378 --> 00:41:22,440
She needs to be held.
I'm not putting her back in.

940
00:41:22,464 --> 00:41:23,464
Are you okay?

941
00:41:23,531 --> 00:41:24,771
No, I'm not okay.

942
00:41:26,167 --> 00:41:29,602
Mer, listen, we gotta get outta
here before this thing blows.

943
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:31,132
Well, how are we gonna do that?

944
00:41:31,156 --> 00:41:32,749
She's connected
to a million things.

945
00:41:32,773 --> 00:41:36,292
You got the bag and the baby.
I'll get the O2 tank and the IV.

946
00:41:36,361 --> 00:41:38,495
And we're gonna disconnect
her from the antibiotics.

947
00:41:38,563 --> 00:41:40,213
Is that gonna be okay?

948
00:41:41,282 --> 00:41:42,631
Yeah. It's gonna have to be.

949
00:41:58,716 --> 00:42:01,901
<i>It seems quaint now, doesn't it?</i>

950
00:42:01,970 --> 00:42:05,337
<i>The flood in the
kitchen, the poison oak,</i>

951
00:42:05,406 --> 00:42:08,174
<i>the fight that leaves
you shaking with rage.</i>

952
00:42:10,261 --> 00:42:14,196
<i>Would it have helped if we
could see what else was coming?</i>

953
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:19,068
<i>Would we have known that those
were the best moments of our lives?</i>
