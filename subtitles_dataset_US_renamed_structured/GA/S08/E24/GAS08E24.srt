1
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:08,118
<i>A month ago, you were in med
school being taught by doctors.</i>

2
00:00:09,776 --> 00:00:11,009
<i>Today...</i>

3
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:17,983
You are the doctors.

4
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:22,537
The seven years you spend
here as a surgical resident

5
00:00:22,606 --> 00:00:24,550
will be the best and
worst of your life.

6
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,871
You will be pushed
to the breaking point.

7
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:32,009
Eight of you will switch
to an easier specialty.

8
00:00:32,033 --> 00:00:34,094
Five of you will crack
under the pressure.

9
00:00:34,118 --> 00:00:35,846
Two of you will
be asked to leave.

10
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:37,385
This is your starting line.

11
00:00:38,488 --> 00:00:39,838
This is your arena.

12
00:00:40,408 --> 00:00:42,107
How well you play,

13
00:00:43,511 --> 00:00:44,576
that's up to you.

14
00:00:59,093 --> 00:01:00,259
Mer?

15
00:01:00,327 --> 00:01:02,044
Meredith! Meredith!

16
00:01:02,112 --> 00:01:04,079
Get up! You have to get up now!

17
00:01:04,148 --> 00:01:05,964
Meredith! Get up!

18
00:01:10,204 --> 00:01:11,204
Oh, God.

19
00:01:20,998 --> 00:01:22,313
I...

20
00:01:22,382 --> 00:01:23,482
Oh.

21
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:30,572
How long was I
out? I don't... I...

22
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,790
I don't know. I lost my...

23
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:33,592
I lost my shoe.

24
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:49,069
Where's... Where's
Derek and Lexie?

25
00:01:49,093 --> 00:01:51,894
I don't... I don't
know. I lost a shoe.

26
00:01:51,962 --> 00:01:53,178
What happened?

27
00:01:53,246 --> 00:01:55,225
The plane crashed,
that's what happened.

28
00:01:55,249 --> 00:01:58,299
We were in a plane, and
it crashed. Plane crash.

29
00:01:58,368 --> 00:01:59,901
Where is Derek?

30
00:02:02,572 --> 00:02:04,005
Cristina, where is Derek?

31
00:02:05,108 --> 00:02:06,708
He was sucked out the side

32
00:02:06,777 --> 00:02:08,276
when we hit the trees,

33
00:02:08,344 --> 00:02:10,089
and then the back
of the plane came off.

34
00:02:10,113 --> 00:02:11,291
It came... It came off.

35
00:02:11,315 --> 00:02:13,065
Lexie was in the
back of the plane.

36
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:16,613
I looked to the back, and all
I could see was freakin' sky.

37
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:21,740
Where is she? I don't
know! I only have one shoe!

38
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:22,841
I'm bleeding.

39
00:02:25,462 --> 00:02:28,196
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

40
00:02:34,271 --> 00:02:35,949
Do you hear... Do
you hear that sound?

41
00:02:35,973 --> 00:02:37,723
Where is that sound coming from?

42
00:02:41,144 --> 00:02:42,911
There.

43
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:45,497
It's coming from over there.

44
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:50,001
Derek!

45
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:53,721
Lexie!

46
00:02:55,309 --> 00:02:56,775
Derek! Lexie!

47
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:00,896
Lexie.

48
00:03:00,964 --> 00:03:01,964
Oh.

49
00:03:25,171 --> 00:03:26,738
Is somebody there? I can't...

50
00:03:26,807 --> 00:03:28,306
I'm... I'm here. I'm here.

51
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,542
I can't...

52
00:03:30,611 --> 00:03:32,888
I'm... I'm stuck in here.
Don't do that. Don't do that.

53
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:34,512
I have to help. Stop. Stop.

54
00:03:35,749 --> 00:03:37,315
I can't get outta here.

55
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:38,850
What's your name?

56
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:41,002
Jerry. Jerry, I'm Arizona.

57
00:03:41,071 --> 00:03:42,715
I don't want you to move, okay?

58
00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:44,717
'Cause you could... You
could injure yourself more.

59
00:03:44,741 --> 00:03:46,908
The controls just... I...

60
00:03:46,977 --> 00:03:48,744
I think one of the engines quit.

61
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:51,129
I... Is anybody else alive?

62
00:03:51,198 --> 00:03:52,198
Um...

63
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:54,116
Yeah.

64
00:03:54,184 --> 00:03:56,651
Yeah, we're all
alive. Well, I...

65
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,670
I think we're all alive.

66
00:03:59,873 --> 00:04:01,473
You're all surgeons.

67
00:04:08,715 --> 00:04:09,764
What's funny?

68
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:12,634
I am... I'm married to
an orthopedic surgeon

69
00:04:12,702 --> 00:04:14,569
and I'm staring at my bone.

70
00:04:14,655 --> 00:04:16,499
And it's not... It's not funny.

71
00:04:16,523 --> 00:04:20,892
I think I'm in a
little bit of shock.

72
00:04:20,961 --> 00:04:22,060
Okay.

73
00:04:22,129 --> 00:04:24,296
But really, I'm fine.

74
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:25,763
It's okay.

75
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:29,317
If I could just get
myself to stop laughing.

76
00:04:30,453 --> 00:04:31,619
Arizona?

77
00:04:33,489 --> 00:04:34,806
Yeah? Yeah?

78
00:04:38,428 --> 00:04:39,861
I can't feel my legs.

79
00:04:44,535 --> 00:04:46,101
Yeah, I knew that was bad.

80
00:04:47,854 --> 00:04:49,420
Lexie. Lexie.

81
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:50,505
I knew you'd show up.

82
00:04:50,574 --> 00:04:51,622
How is she?

83
00:04:51,691 --> 00:04:52,931
She's awake and responsive.

84
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:55,105
How you doing in there?

85
00:04:55,129 --> 00:04:56,744
I'm... I'm great.

86
00:04:56,813 --> 00:04:59,492
Yeah? Good girl. We're
gonna get you outta here, okay?

87
00:04:59,516 --> 00:05:00,516
Okay.

88
00:05:05,422 --> 00:05:07,923
She's tachycardic
and short of breath.

89
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:09,786
We have to find Derek.

90
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:10,970
Okay, you know
what? We've got Lexie.

91
00:05:10,994 --> 00:05:12,260
So go. Go find him.

92
00:05:12,328 --> 00:05:13,979
Go, go. Go try and find him.

93
00:05:15,516 --> 00:05:16,716
We gotta get her outta there.

94
00:05:16,767 --> 00:05:17,782
Oh...

95
00:05:22,606 --> 00:05:23,888
Pop it back in.

96
00:05:23,957 --> 00:05:25,423
Pop it back in.

97
00:05:26,676 --> 00:05:29,156
Wait. Wait. Wait.
Wait. Wait. Wait.

98
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:31,112
Okay, do it.

99
00:05:33,801 --> 00:05:36,067
Oh, God!

100
00:05:37,538 --> 00:05:39,804
Derek! Derek!

101
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:42,123
Derek!

102
00:05:46,363 --> 00:05:47,895
Derek!

103
00:05:51,368 --> 00:05:52,733
Derek!

104
00:05:53,903 --> 00:05:55,069
Derek!

105
00:05:56,623 --> 00:05:57,689
Meredith?

106
00:05:57,757 --> 00:05:59,123
Derek!

107
00:06:08,485 --> 00:06:10,217
Meredith.

108
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:11,453
Derek!

109
00:06:12,422 --> 00:06:13,554
Meredith.

110
00:06:15,058 --> 00:06:16,257
Derek!

111
00:06:18,228 --> 00:06:19,243
Meredith.

112
00:06:47,591 --> 00:06:49,335
Sir. Have you seen Dr. Altman?

113
00:06:49,359 --> 00:06:51,793
No, but, um, sir, you
have a few messages.

114
00:06:51,862 --> 00:06:53,372
Is anybody dying? No.

115
00:06:53,396 --> 00:06:54,707
Is it Dr. Yang? No.

116
00:06:54,731 --> 00:06:56,430
Then send all
calls to voice mail.

117
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,844
I have multiple
traumas coming in.

118
00:06:57,868 --> 00:07:00,568
I don't have time.
And find me Altman.

119
00:07:00,637 --> 00:07:02,365
All right. Where do
you want me, Chief?

120
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:05,157
Incoming. Building collapsed
on a bunch of firefighter recruits.

121
00:07:05,225 --> 00:07:07,725
Last day of their training.
Happy graduation.

122
00:07:07,795 --> 00:07:09,661
Okay, well, you
have me till 7:00.

123
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:12,363
I've got a dinner with the
last group of residents tonight.

124
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,510
I do not understand why
you're spending your week

125
00:07:14,534 --> 00:07:16,212
taking the residents
out to dinner.

126
00:07:16,236 --> 00:07:19,971
Oh, come on, Hunt. It's a tradition.
We're celebrating a milestone.

127
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:21,600
You're welcome
to join. I'll pass.

128
00:07:21,624 --> 00:07:24,270
I'm telling you, it's an
evening you won't forget,

129
00:07:24,294 --> 00:07:25,621
and the kids, they just love it.

130
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:27,612
Could someone
please mercy kill me,

131
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,425
so I don't have
to go to this thing?

132
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:30,682
You do me, I'll do you.

133
00:07:30,751 --> 00:07:32,395
Better leave me a bullet.
Hell if I'm going alone.

134
00:07:32,419 --> 00:07:34,263
Yang and Grey skipped
town at the perfect time.

135
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,115
Oh, no, they will be
back in time for the dinner.

136
00:07:36,139 --> 00:07:38,351
Because I had to pick up
their stupid dry cleaning,

137
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:40,403
and dig through
their stupid closets

138
00:07:40,427 --> 00:07:41,743
for their stupid heels,

139
00:07:41,811 --> 00:07:45,013
all the while babysitting
Mer's stupid kid.

140
00:07:45,081 --> 00:07:47,482
She's not stupid.
She's actually adorable.

141
00:07:47,551 --> 00:07:49,317
Hey, you decide on Tulane yet?

142
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:51,013
No, I'm still
weighing my options.

143
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:53,221
Lot of factors involved.

144
00:07:53,289 --> 00:07:54,706
At least you have options.

145
00:07:54,775 --> 00:07:57,136
Hey, want to hear mine?
When I go back to Moline,

146
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,977
do I work at the Tastee Freez
or milk cows on the farm?

147
00:08:00,046 --> 00:08:02,129
Tastee Freez. No-brainer.

148
00:08:03,667 --> 00:08:06,067
You're still a doctor.

149
00:08:06,136 --> 00:08:08,169
Just go to Tulane already.

150
00:08:10,473 --> 00:08:11,806
<i>It's a thing.</i>

151
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:13,553
People are together,
but they live apart.

152
00:08:13,577 --> 00:08:15,076
"Live-a-partners."

153
00:08:15,144 --> 00:08:16,422
It's common enough
to have a name.

154
00:08:16,446 --> 00:08:17,957
Syphilis is common
enough to have a name.

155
00:08:17,981 --> 00:08:20,141
Doesn't mean I want it.
Who doesn't want what?

156
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,634
Somebody has gotten themselves

157
00:08:22,703 --> 00:08:25,470
a surgical internship
in Los Angeles.

158
00:08:25,539 --> 00:08:27,572
I'm branching out.
Congratulations.

159
00:08:27,641 --> 00:08:30,124
Or not?

160
00:08:30,193 --> 00:08:32,038
We wouldn't be the first
commuter marriage on the planet.

161
00:08:32,062 --> 00:08:33,895
You're getting married?

162
00:08:33,963 --> 00:08:36,047
Oh, that's fantastic.

163
00:08:36,116 --> 00:08:37,827
Okay, you should probably
leave while you can.

164
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:41,820
I'm going. Because my love is
strong enough to handle the space.

165
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:47,074
Long-distance relationship?
Not the end of the world.

166
00:08:47,144 --> 00:08:48,554
You gonna give
me some crap about

167
00:08:48,578 --> 00:08:50,423
"absence makes the
heart grow fonder"?

168
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:52,480
No. Absence makes
the sex grow hotter.

169
00:08:52,549 --> 00:08:54,093
Arizona's only been
gone for one night,

170
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:56,462
and already, she's inspired
a totally hot "I miss you" thing

171
00:08:56,486 --> 00:08:58,113
when she gets back. Mmm-hmm.

172
00:08:58,137 --> 00:08:59,971
I have lingerie and
flavored body paint...

173
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:02,359
There is a God.

174
00:09:05,162 --> 00:09:07,913
Okay, ready? On
my count. One, two...

175
00:09:07,981 --> 00:09:08,981
Three.

176
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,233
Again.

177
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:14,636
One, two, three.

178
00:09:18,342 --> 00:09:20,141
Damn it!

179
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:23,077
Lexie, run it down for me.

180
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:25,579
My legs and my
pelvis are crushed.

181
00:09:26,516 --> 00:09:28,365
And I can't feel my other arm,

182
00:09:28,435 --> 00:09:31,453
so I'm not sure it's
even there anymore.

183
00:09:31,521 --> 00:09:35,640
And, my chest feels
like it's gonna explode,

184
00:09:35,692 --> 00:09:40,494
so it's probably a
massive hemothorax.

185
00:09:40,563 --> 00:09:44,398
We... We gotta... We gotta get
the oxygen from the plane. Okay?

186
00:09:44,467 --> 00:09:46,179
And fluids. Fluids. She
needs water bottles.

187
00:09:46,203 --> 00:09:48,586
And the tubes, the oxygen tubes.

188
00:09:48,655 --> 00:09:50,088
We can get her fluids.

189
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:52,290
We can get her fluids,
okay? Go get 'em.

190
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:55,259
Go. Go get 'em. Go get 'em.

191
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:57,290
Why aren't you doing anything?

192
00:09:57,314 --> 00:10:00,765
She... She knows it won't help.

193
00:10:00,834 --> 00:10:01,933
No.

194
00:10:02,002 --> 00:10:03,734
You are gonna be fine.

195
00:10:04,955 --> 00:10:07,200
Stop. You're gonna be fine.

196
00:10:07,224 --> 00:10:08,389
Go! Get 'em!

197
00:10:19,136 --> 00:10:21,119
I'm gonna be right back.

198
00:10:24,057 --> 00:10:26,168
I've got a lot of free fluid
in the upper right quadrant.

199
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:27,937
- Somebody call CT.
- Right away, Doctor.

200
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:29,093
Open femur in two.

201
00:10:29,162 --> 00:10:30,462
Strong pulse. He's good.

202
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:32,324
I need those chest films, please.
- Right away.

203
00:10:32,348 --> 00:10:33,893
What's up? I just got a call

204
00:10:33,917 --> 00:10:35,157
from Rita Simon this morning.

205
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:38,352
Really? I haven't heard
from Rita since Baghdad.

206
00:10:38,421 --> 00:10:40,299
Yeah, I was surprised, too,
especially when she asked me

207
00:10:40,323 --> 00:10:43,824
if I knew if you were taking
the Chief job at MEDCOM.

208
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:45,376
I was gonna tell you.

209
00:10:45,428 --> 00:10:46,761
But you didn't.

210
00:10:46,829 --> 00:10:48,541
I've already lost the
head of neuro to Harvard,

211
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:50,026
and now I have to find
a new head of cardio

212
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:51,794
on top of everyone else?
I'm not taking the job.

213
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:53,501
I just haven't had
time to tell MEDCOM.

214
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,097
What... What do
you mean, you're...

215
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:56,337
Let's get him ready for CT.

216
00:11:09,652 --> 00:11:10,696
I'm gonna try and splint this.

217
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,920
No, I can do it. I can do it.

218
00:11:12,989 --> 00:11:15,356
Jerry needs
C-spine stabilization.

219
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:16,824
Who's Jerry?

220
00:11:18,795 --> 00:11:20,306
How are you doing there, Jerry?

221
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:23,564
I give us four hours
tops before they find us.

222
00:11:23,633 --> 00:11:25,065
There's a transmitter
in the plane

223
00:11:25,135 --> 00:11:27,769
that lets out a squawk that
should lead 'em right to us.

224
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:30,070
Oh!

225
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:31,488
Did you find Derek?

226
00:11:31,557 --> 00:11:34,108
Uh, not yet. Jerry,
do you have any tape?

227
00:11:34,177 --> 00:11:36,660
Uh, yeah. Uh, in the bulkhead.

228
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:38,863
In the cabinet to your left.

229
00:11:38,932 --> 00:11:40,409
There's a flare gun
in there, too. Yes.

230
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:41,810
You hear a chopper,
you fire it straight up.

231
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:44,418
And Lexie? Not good.

232
00:11:44,487 --> 00:11:47,288
Oh, great. Great,
great, great, great, great.

233
00:11:47,357 --> 00:11:48,756
Aah!

234
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:53,856
Okay, keep your
head very still. Yeah.

235
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,520
Good, good. Okay.

236
00:11:57,517 --> 00:11:58,749
Jerry...

237
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,652
Is there a first aid kit?

238
00:12:01,722 --> 00:12:03,088
A... Yeah, a big one.

239
00:12:03,156 --> 00:12:06,424
In the cabinet on your
right, behind the cockpit.

240
00:12:06,493 --> 00:12:09,243
There's no cabinet there.

241
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:11,207
Just tell her to hang on
for another four hours.

242
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:12,396
Great.

243
00:12:19,022 --> 00:12:20,655
Hey, hey, wait. Don't leave!

244
00:12:20,724 --> 00:12:21,851
I can't feel my legs.

245
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:23,319
That's because
I'm trapped, right?

246
00:12:23,343 --> 00:12:25,126
I mean, I'm gonna
be okay, right?

247
00:12:25,194 --> 00:12:26,338
I'm not paralyzed.
I'm gonna walk again.

248
00:12:26,362 --> 00:12:28,379
I'm gonna be okay, right?

249
00:12:37,207 --> 00:12:38,222
I'm sorry.

250
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,800
Cristina.

251
00:12:49,869 --> 00:12:52,214
I can't find him. I
looked everywhere.

252
00:12:52,238 --> 00:12:53,966
I can't find him.
Maybe he's fine.

253
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:55,273
Maybe he went for help.

254
00:12:55,342 --> 00:12:56,835
Maybe, but I gotta...
I gotta keep looking.

255
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:58,292
No, Meredith.

256
00:12:59,128 --> 00:13:01,028
You should come... Help Lexie.

257
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:04,882
You're doing good.

258
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:06,550
Mark... Cristina's...

259
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:07,930
Cristina's gonna
be back any minute.

260
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:09,131
Mark... She's gonna be back,

261
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:10,399
and we're gonna
get you stabilized,

262
00:13:10,423 --> 00:13:12,506
and you're gonna be fine, okay?

263
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:15,326
Mark... Just a few
minutes, okay?

264
00:13:15,395 --> 00:13:17,728
She'll be back
any minute. Mark...

265
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,430
I'm... I'm dying.

266
00:13:21,984 --> 00:13:23,251
What? No, you're not.

267
00:13:25,021 --> 00:13:26,120
I am.

268
00:13:26,873 --> 00:13:29,307
Please... Tell...

269
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:35,213
Tell Meredith

270
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:36,881
that I love her.

271
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:40,651
And that she's a good sister.

272
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,571
Please tell my dad...

273
00:13:43,657 --> 00:13:45,977
You're not dying.
You're gonna be fine.

274
00:13:47,943 --> 00:13:49,209
Hold my hand.

275
00:13:50,613 --> 00:13:53,053
I'm not holding your hand,
because you're not dying.

276
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:55,182
Hold my hand.

277
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:57,885
No. You're not dying.

278
00:13:57,954 --> 00:14:00,455
Do you hear me?
You don't die today.

279
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:28,599
I love you.

280
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:33,120
You don't have to say it

281
00:14:33,189 --> 00:14:35,167
just because I said
it. I do. I love you.

282
00:14:35,191 --> 00:14:38,271
I love you. I've always
been in love with you.

283
00:14:38,678 --> 00:14:40,523
I will always be
in love with you.

284
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:42,174
Yeah? Yeah.

285
00:14:42,198 --> 00:14:44,476
Which is why you
have to stay alive.

286
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,969
We... We... We're
gonna get married.

287
00:14:48,037 --> 00:14:51,238
And you're gonna make
an amazing surgeon.

288
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:54,008
And we're gonna
have two or three kids.

289
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:57,979
So Sofia

290
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:01,115
can have siblings.

291
00:15:01,183 --> 00:15:03,551
Yeah. A sister and two brothers.

292
00:15:05,221 --> 00:15:07,187
And... That's nice.

293
00:15:07,256 --> 00:15:09,256
We're gonna be happy, Lex...

294
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:10,858
You and me.

295
00:15:10,927 --> 00:15:14,045
We're gonna have the
best life, Lexie, you and me.

296
00:15:14,113 --> 00:15:16,146
We're gonna be so happy.

297
00:15:17,167 --> 00:15:19,099
So you can't die, okay?

298
00:15:20,903 --> 00:15:22,403
You can't die...

299
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:27,491
Because we're supposed
to end up together.

300
00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:31,528
We're meant to be.

301
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,103
Meant to be.

302
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:50,615
I love you.

303
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:51,883
I love you.

304
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:55,536
I love you.

305
00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:57,888
I love you.

306
00:15:58,557 --> 00:15:59,651
I love you.

307
00:15:59,675 --> 00:16:02,176
I love you. I love
you. I love you.

308
00:16:04,146 --> 00:16:05,613
I love you.

309
00:16:05,682 --> 00:16:06,802
I love you.

310
00:16:08,618 --> 00:16:09,850
I love you.

311
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:11,285
I love you.

312
00:16:26,386 --> 00:16:27,584
Lexie.

313
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:02,686
Your wife is bonkers.

314
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:03,888
Yeah, but she's cute.

315
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:05,400
No, she pulled me off
every single peds case

316
00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:06,857
before she left.

317
00:17:06,926 --> 00:17:08,620
She's punishing me
for choosing Hopkins.

318
00:17:08,644 --> 00:17:10,227
Ouch.

319
00:17:10,296 --> 00:17:11,606
You know what? I don't
care. I'm calling her right now.

320
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:13,342
Hey, Karev, no.
Put that phone away.

321
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:15,077
No good's gonna come
out of that. I'm pissed.

322
00:17:15,101 --> 00:17:16,967
Yeah, well, so is she.

323
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,364
You know why? 'Cause she
loves you. She'll get over it.

324
00:17:18,388 --> 00:17:19,732
The best thing you can
do is just leave it alone.

325
00:17:19,756 --> 00:17:21,150
Wait 'till she comes back.

326
00:17:21,174 --> 00:17:22,951
Talk to her tomorrow, when
you've both calmed down.

327
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:24,520
If you got nothing to
do, scrub in with me.

328
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:27,744
I've got an open femur.
Oh! There you are.

329
00:17:29,682 --> 00:17:31,009
Why tomorrow? I thought
she was coming back tonight.

330
00:17:31,033 --> 00:17:32,733
Uh, tonight I've
got things planned

331
00:17:32,802 --> 00:17:35,936
that don't include her
screaming your name.

332
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,973
Mmm.

333
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:40,786
Will you at least tell
me why? Why what?

334
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:43,044
Why you turned down
the job at MEDCOM.

335
00:17:43,129 --> 00:17:44,539
No. Hunt. Altman.

336
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:45,880
Tell me. No.

337
00:17:45,948 --> 00:17:47,510
Somebody want to tell
me what MEDCOM is?

338
00:17:47,534 --> 00:17:49,261
It would make this a
whole lot more fun for me.

339
00:17:49,285 --> 00:17:50,518
Army medical command.

340
00:17:50,586 --> 00:17:52,986
They oversee every
medical operation

341
00:17:53,055 --> 00:17:54,888
in the US and in Europe.

342
00:17:54,957 --> 00:17:56,001
Fancy. Very.

343
00:17:56,025 --> 00:17:57,174
She'd be instructing,

344
00:17:57,243 --> 00:17:59,110
innovating surgical
field techniques,

345
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:02,280
and they're interested in
funding her stem cell research.

346
00:18:02,348 --> 00:18:03,425
Sounds like a good fit.

347
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:05,900
It is a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity,

348
00:18:05,968 --> 00:18:07,184
so I just don't understand...

349
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:08,964
So what, now you're
pissed that I'm not leaving?

350
00:18:08,988 --> 00:18:10,187
Where's your loyalty?

351
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:12,823
You're being asked
to serve your country.

352
00:18:19,382 --> 00:18:21,542
Do you know where
we are right now, Hunt?

353
00:18:22,868 --> 00:18:25,386
This is the room
where my husband died.

354
00:18:25,454 --> 00:18:27,555
Right here on this table.

355
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:31,425
And no matter how many
wonderful and amazing

356
00:18:31,493 --> 00:18:34,028
and miraculous things
happen in this room,

357
00:18:34,096 --> 00:18:36,731
it will always be the room
where my husband died.

358
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,366
And the south elevator

359
00:18:39,435 --> 00:18:41,313
will always be the place
where I met him, and...

360
00:18:41,337 --> 00:18:43,537
And the cafeteria will
always be the place

361
00:18:43,606 --> 00:18:46,173
where he bought my lunch.

362
00:18:46,242 --> 00:18:49,762
I would love to leave
here and never look back.

363
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,647
But you are as beaten

364
00:18:53,716 --> 00:18:56,250
and broken as I
have ever seen you.

365
00:18:59,822 --> 00:19:02,790
And after everything that
I have put you through,

366
00:19:03,659 --> 00:19:07,127
the tolerance and kindness

367
00:19:07,196 --> 00:19:09,477
and friendship that
you have shown me,

368
00:19:09,782 --> 00:19:12,116
I am not going to leave you

369
00:19:12,986 --> 00:19:14,585
because of my loyalty.

370
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:17,821
I am not going to leave here
for MEDCOM or anywhere else.

371
00:19:22,344 --> 00:19:25,079
This isn't holding.
3-0 Prolene, please.

372
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:31,585
Derek!

373
00:19:33,756 --> 00:19:34,888
Derek!

374
00:19:34,958 --> 00:19:37,057
I don't understand how
this keeps happening.

375
00:19:37,126 --> 00:19:38,270
Cristina, we have to find him.

376
00:19:38,294 --> 00:19:39,460
I'm serious.

377
00:19:39,529 --> 00:19:41,546
I do not understand how
this keeps happening.

378
00:19:41,614 --> 00:19:44,026
We have to find him because
I don't think he went for help.

379
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:46,300
We keep dying. We're
in a plane crash, Mer.

380
00:19:46,369 --> 00:19:47,501
Like... Like, right now.

381
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:49,615
If he went for help, if
Derek had gone for help,

382
00:19:49,639 --> 00:19:51,806
he would've sent a
message or something.

383
00:19:51,874 --> 00:19:54,241
I mean, we have to find
him. Something is wrong.

384
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:56,430
I can tell you one thing.
When we get out of here,

385
00:19:56,462 --> 00:19:58,907
I am getting the hell away
from Seattle Grace-Mercy death,

386
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:00,130
and I'm never looking back!

387
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,732
Cristina...

388
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,100
I think Derek is dead.

389
00:20:03,169 --> 00:20:04,763
He would've come for us by now.

390
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:06,632
He definitely would've
come for us by now.

391
00:20:06,656 --> 00:20:09,340
I think he's dead.
And Lexie's dead.

392
00:20:09,409 --> 00:20:11,775
My husband and
sister are both dead!

393
00:20:11,844 --> 00:20:13,888
And we are gonna
die out here, too!

394
00:20:13,912 --> 00:20:15,457
We are gonna die out here...

395
00:20:15,481 --> 00:20:16,759
Keep it together.
Keep it together.

396
00:20:16,783 --> 00:20:18,409
No, you keep it
together! I'm trying!

397
00:20:18,433 --> 00:20:20,835
I know. Keep... Keep
it together anyway.

398
00:20:24,406 --> 00:20:26,406
Keep it together anyway.

399
00:20:27,176 --> 00:20:28,608
My sister is dead.

400
00:20:28,678 --> 00:20:30,144
Keep it together anyway.

401
00:20:30,212 --> 00:20:32,195
Do you think Derek is dead?

402
00:20:32,264 --> 00:20:33,531
I don't know. Maybe.

403
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:37,067
But I've got PTSD, so
you know I'm not reliable.

404
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:39,804
Cristina...

405
00:20:39,872 --> 00:20:42,306
You are still my person,

406
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:44,709
even if I'm not yours.

407
00:20:44,777 --> 00:20:46,176
Meredith, Meredith.

408
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:47,260
Meredith.

409
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:55,018
I heard your voice.

410
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,587
I thought I... I thought
I was dreaming.

411
00:20:59,976 --> 00:21:01,359
Oh, my God.

412
00:21:10,353 --> 00:21:11,393
Oh, I found it!

413
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:12,581
The first aid box?

414
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:13,804
My shoe.

415
00:21:16,142 --> 00:21:17,775
Is she gonna be okay?

416
00:21:17,843 --> 00:21:19,209
She's not barefoot anymore.

417
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:21,359
Well, I guess that's something.

418
00:21:34,326 --> 00:21:35,721
Son of a... Damn it.
MEREDITH: I know.

419
00:21:35,745 --> 00:21:37,723
Son of a... I know.

420
00:21:37,747 --> 00:21:39,187
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

421
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,519
Okay. Where's Lexie?

422
00:21:49,258 --> 00:21:51,092
Clothes. No?

423
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,313
Oh.

424
00:21:56,865 --> 00:21:57,932
Okay.

425
00:22:00,853 --> 00:22:02,936
Okay, let's just keep
it together, okay?

426
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:05,590
Okay.

427
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:08,259
Clothes.

428
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:09,871
Loosen the
tourniquet a little bit.

429
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:11,162
You'll bleed to death.

430
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:12,679
I need to save my hand.

431
00:22:12,749 --> 00:22:14,075
Well, I'm trying
to save your life.

432
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:15,382
Oh, safety pin. Safety pin.

433
00:22:15,451 --> 00:22:16,901
Bring that.

434
00:22:16,969 --> 00:22:19,370
Do you have a
T-shirt or a bandana?

435
00:22:19,438 --> 00:22:20,438
Got it. Got it.

436
00:22:25,011 --> 00:22:27,394
Okay, we have to
close the wound.

437
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:31,649
Use the safety pin.

438
00:22:31,717 --> 00:22:33,746
Weave your way inside and out

439
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:36,219
and then put the
bandana on top of it

440
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,955
and tape it.

441
00:22:38,024 --> 00:22:39,823
And what's the...
What's the T-shirt for?

442
00:22:39,892 --> 00:22:41,120
Put it in my mouth. I'm
probably gonna scream a lot,

443
00:22:41,144 --> 00:22:42,588
and I'm gonna... I'm
gonna... I'm gonna pass out.

444
00:22:42,612 --> 00:22:44,211
Okay.

445
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,680
Good. Okay.

446
00:22:45,748 --> 00:22:47,247
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

447
00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:50,768
Please pass out.
Please pass out.

448
00:22:50,837 --> 00:22:52,686
Please pass out.

449
00:22:52,772 --> 00:22:54,522
Please pass out.
Please pass out.

450
00:22:54,607 --> 00:22:56,106
Please pass out.
Please pass out.

451
00:22:57,943 --> 00:22:59,337
You'll have to close up for me.

452
00:22:59,361 --> 00:23:01,311
I have to preorder our duck...

453
00:23:01,381 --> 00:23:05,383
Slow-roasted, it takes
six hours, falls off the bone.

454
00:23:05,451 --> 00:23:07,451
Oh, the residency
dinner. Can I come?

455
00:23:07,503 --> 00:23:09,536
You've had your
turn. Now it's theirs.

456
00:23:09,622 --> 00:23:12,182
You kids jazzed
about dinner? Yes, sir.

457
00:23:14,276 --> 00:23:15,356
Oh, very jazzed.

458
00:23:16,145 --> 00:23:17,494
Yum.

459
00:23:17,563 --> 00:23:20,464
Well, call me Miles
Davis, 'cause I'm jazzed.

460
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:27,483
I'll give you 10 bucks to
stab me in the face right now.

461
00:23:43,456 --> 00:23:44,521
Hey.

462
00:23:47,643 --> 00:23:50,778
Now I know why you were
trying so hard to keep her here.

463
00:23:52,982 --> 00:23:56,249
If Cristina were staying,
you'd be taking that job.

464
00:23:59,321 --> 00:24:00,321
I'll be fine.

465
00:24:00,389 --> 00:24:02,472
No, no, Owen, you won't.

466
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:04,741
You are losing
the love of your life.

467
00:24:07,646 --> 00:24:08,679
Yeah.

468
00:24:08,747 --> 00:24:11,581
Everywhere I look,
I expect to see her.

469
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:14,768
She's not even gone,
and I miss her already.

470
00:24:16,772 --> 00:24:18,892
I wish I could tell
you that will go away,

471
00:24:19,575 --> 00:24:20,774
but it won't.

472
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:27,347
Matches. Yes, God. Finally.

473
00:24:27,416 --> 00:24:28,615
Fire. We can build a fire.

474
00:24:28,683 --> 00:24:30,229
We Should. They'll see a fire.

475
00:24:30,253 --> 00:24:31,568
Let's get a fire started.

476
00:24:31,637 --> 00:24:34,855
Yeah, Mark. We need...
We need to start a fire.

477
00:24:34,923 --> 00:24:37,541
Mark. Mark.

478
00:24:37,593 --> 00:24:38,892
You have to help.

479
00:24:38,978 --> 00:24:40,577
I'll figure out how
to get it started.

480
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:42,357
No. You know what?
He doesn't get to do this.

481
00:24:42,381 --> 00:24:43,830
He doesn't get to stop helping.

482
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:45,716
I'm sorry he lost Lexie,

483
00:24:45,768 --> 00:24:47,713
but she was your sister,
and you're still helping.

484
00:24:47,737 --> 00:24:50,249
He has to help because
the sky is falling, Mark.

485
00:24:50,273 --> 00:24:51,355
Cristina.

486
00:24:51,424 --> 00:24:53,791
No, no, no.

487
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:55,370
You know, if there's
one thing that I've learned

488
00:24:55,394 --> 00:24:58,261
with all the... The bombs
and the guns to my head and...

489
00:24:58,331 --> 00:25:00,030
And the buses running
down my friends

490
00:25:00,098 --> 00:25:02,582
is that I am not
interested in dying.

491
00:25:02,651 --> 00:25:05,352
I want to get out of here,
and I want to go home.

492
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:07,671
And everyone has to help.

493
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:10,240
Mark, get up. Get
up and help, Mark.

494
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:12,109
Get up.

495
00:25:14,362 --> 00:25:16,563
Mark? Mark? Mark?

496
00:25:18,634 --> 00:25:21,619
Mark. Please. Please be okay.

497
00:25:23,255 --> 00:25:24,421
Mark.

498
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:26,006
Oh!

499
00:25:26,075 --> 00:25:27,708
Oh, crap.

500
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:28,842
Mer!

501
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,700
What happened?

502
00:25:36,769 --> 00:25:38,513
When I rechecked him, he had
muffled heart sounds and JVD.

503
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:39,537
Delayed tamponade?

504
00:25:41,389 --> 00:25:42,756
It's a cardiac tamponade.

505
00:25:42,825 --> 00:25:44,591
Are you sure? 75%.

506
00:25:45,912 --> 00:25:48,329
70%. 70% sure.
That's not very sure.

507
00:25:48,397 --> 00:25:50,631
Well, if you want me to be
sure, get me an ultrasound.

508
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:53,340
Will you man the
ultrasound? Mmm-hmm.

509
00:25:55,037 --> 00:25:56,403
Thank you.

510
00:25:59,959 --> 00:26:01,669
Looks like the
pericardium's about to burst.

511
00:26:01,693 --> 00:26:04,055
We have to drain his pericardial
sac and relieve the pressure, or...

512
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:05,896
- Or his heart will stop.
- With what?

513
00:26:05,964 --> 00:26:07,097
We don't even have

514
00:26:07,165 --> 00:26:09,183
an 18-gauge spinal
needle. I don't know.

515
00:26:09,251 --> 00:26:10,517
All right. 18 gauge.

516
00:26:12,787 --> 00:26:14,388
Okay, I got it. Okay.

517
00:26:14,457 --> 00:26:16,390
Hold this. Take the top off.

518
00:26:16,459 --> 00:26:17,459
Okay. Why?

519
00:26:17,526 --> 00:26:18,670
Use that right there.

520
00:26:18,694 --> 00:26:20,004
Use the tube.
Brilliant. Brilliant.

521
00:26:20,028 --> 00:26:21,690
All right, sure.
Okay, this will work.

522
00:26:21,714 --> 00:26:22,779
Sanitize that.

523
00:26:30,355 --> 00:26:31,688
Is the tubing long enough?

524
00:26:31,757 --> 00:26:33,356
I'm going in, um, subxiphoid.

525
00:26:33,426 --> 00:26:34,426
Knife.

526
00:26:38,297 --> 00:26:39,446
Okay, needle.

527
00:26:42,935 --> 00:26:44,551
Here. Here you go, Mer.

528
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:46,086
Try not to move, Mark.

529
00:26:46,154 --> 00:26:47,688
Try not to move.

530
00:26:47,756 --> 00:26:49,134
Easy, Mark. It's okay. Don't
move. It's gonna be okay.

531
00:26:49,158 --> 00:26:50,641
Aim for his left shoulder.

532
00:26:50,709 --> 00:26:52,703
Wait. Don't puncture his
heart. I know, I know, I know.

533
00:26:52,727 --> 00:26:53,838
Careful. Don't
puncture the heart.

534
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:54,862
I know.

535
00:26:58,234 --> 00:26:59,983
Okay.

536
00:27:05,157 --> 00:27:06,206
Deeper!

537
00:27:07,843 --> 00:27:09,921
Good. Excellent. That's
it. That's it. That's it. Great.

538
00:27:09,945 --> 00:27:11,211
Very good. It's gonna be okay.

539
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,623
That's good. That's
it. That's exactly it.

540
00:27:12,647 --> 00:27:13,842
You did it. Just let
it drain into here.

541
00:27:13,866 --> 00:27:15,510
You did it. You got it.

542
00:27:15,534 --> 00:27:17,462
I got it. I got the
bag. You got it.

543
00:27:18,687 --> 00:27:19,687
There.

544
00:27:22,324 --> 00:27:23,564
Wanna go for lunch?

545
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,814
Hey! What the
hell are you doing?

546
00:27:30,883 --> 00:27:33,203
Eating. No. No. You
have a dinner tonight.

547
00:27:33,235 --> 00:27:34,875
The... The biggest
dinner of your lives.

548
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:37,521
Here's the thing,
I can't eat duck.

549
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:40,157
I had a duck on the
farm. It lived in the house.

550
00:27:40,226 --> 00:27:41,466
So order the steak.

551
00:27:43,011 --> 00:27:44,555
Here's the thing, I had a cow...

552
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:46,224
Look, no one really
wants to go tonight.

553
00:27:46,248 --> 00:27:48,331
He's preordering the duck.

554
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,695
Come on. Where's... Where's
your sense of occasion?

555
00:27:50,719 --> 00:27:52,313
Mmm. In Baltimore at Hopkins.

556
00:27:53,589 --> 00:27:56,022
Webber and I have issues.
He knows what he did.

557
00:27:57,393 --> 00:27:59,337
I failed my boards. I
have nothing to celebrate.

558
00:27:59,361 --> 00:28:01,823
Oh, boo-hoo. Oh, poor
April didn't pass her test.

559
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:02,980
Big whoop, okay?

560
00:28:03,048 --> 00:28:04,693
I got fired from Chief Resident,

561
00:28:04,717 --> 00:28:06,294
then I got fired
from this hospital.

562
00:28:06,318 --> 00:28:07,729
Oh, my husband cheated on me.

563
00:28:07,753 --> 00:28:09,836
You were married to a man?

564
00:28:12,174 --> 00:28:14,107
And then he died.

565
00:28:14,176 --> 00:28:15,787
So I didn't think I was
gonna ever be happy again.

566
00:28:15,811 --> 00:28:18,595
But now my life is
pretty damn great.

567
00:28:18,647 --> 00:28:21,014
So you're having a
rough time. It's nothing.

568
00:28:21,083 --> 00:28:22,282
It's a blip.

569
00:28:22,351 --> 00:28:24,517
And in the meantime,
you're missing your moment.

570
00:28:24,586 --> 00:28:26,519
You survived residency.

571
00:28:26,588 --> 00:28:28,321
Stop and celebrate that.

572
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:31,491
'Cause life... Changes in
an instant. It turns on a dime.

573
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,826
One minute you're miserable,

574
00:28:32,894 --> 00:28:34,578
and then the next...

575
00:28:34,647 --> 00:28:36,847
You've met the most
amazing woman in the world

576
00:28:36,916 --> 00:28:38,031
and are in love.

577
00:28:39,268 --> 00:28:42,286
This moment, your moment,

578
00:28:42,354 --> 00:28:44,154
it only happens once.

579
00:28:45,474 --> 00:28:47,524
Oh. And the duck

580
00:28:47,592 --> 00:28:49,393
is freakin' amazing.

581
00:28:50,546 --> 00:28:51,562
Hey.

582
00:28:58,604 --> 00:29:00,471
Mark?

583
00:29:00,539 --> 00:29:02,506
What happened? Tamponade.

584
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,374
Mer did a pericardiocentesis.

585
00:29:04,443 --> 00:29:05,443
Oh, my God.

586
00:29:05,494 --> 00:29:06,894
He's holding on for now.

587
00:29:11,366 --> 00:29:12,382
Where's Lexie?

588
00:29:14,469 --> 00:29:15,835
Where's Lexie?

589
00:29:16,505 --> 00:29:17,738
Lexie's dead.

590
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:21,224
So we should get a fire started.

591
00:29:21,293 --> 00:29:22,813
Oh, I've got... I've
got the matches.

592
00:29:23,712 --> 00:29:25,529
We have five left.

593
00:29:25,598 --> 00:29:26,914
Make it big so they see.

594
00:29:29,234 --> 00:29:30,900
What happened to
the four hours, Jerry?

595
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:32,481
It's been more than four hours.

596
00:29:32,505 --> 00:29:34,265
Shh. Listen. What
does that mean?

597
00:29:34,289 --> 00:29:36,434
I mean, does that mean
that they're not coming for us?

598
00:29:36,458 --> 00:29:39,242
I mean, you said four hours.
You said four hours tops.

599
00:29:39,311 --> 00:29:40,860
Chopper!

600
00:29:44,099 --> 00:29:45,594
Oh, my God. It's
a helicopter! Hey!

601
00:29:45,618 --> 00:29:47,129
Help! MEREDITH: Help!

602
00:29:47,153 --> 00:29:48,296
Where is it?

603
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,447
I don't see it. I don't see it.

604
00:29:49,471 --> 00:29:50,720
Help!

605
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:51,971
Get the flare gun!

606
00:29:52,041 --> 00:29:53,921
The flare gun! In
the bag! In the bag!

607
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:55,687
Oh, God, shoot it!
- We're down here!

608
00:29:55,711 --> 00:29:57,560
Come back!

609
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:58,673
Why isn't it working?

610
00:29:58,697 --> 00:30:00,041
Shoot it again! Shoot it again!

611
00:30:01,533 --> 00:30:02,549
Give it to me.

612
00:30:02,617 --> 00:30:03,800
Help!

613
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:06,170
Help!

614
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:07,454
Oh, my God, no!

615
00:30:07,522 --> 00:30:08,806
Help!

616
00:30:10,059 --> 00:30:11,853
Oh, my God. No, no! Come back!

617
00:30:11,877 --> 00:30:13,260
No, no, no!

618
00:30:27,192 --> 00:30:28,725
I chose Tulane.

619
00:30:31,229 --> 00:30:32,328
Good.

620
00:30:34,633 --> 00:30:36,283
That's good for you.

621
00:30:36,351 --> 00:30:37,451
Yeah.

622
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:43,607
I feel sick, by the way.

623
00:30:43,676 --> 00:30:45,809
Sick to leave here,

624
00:30:47,012 --> 00:30:48,092
to leave you.

625
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,413
But, um...

626
00:30:50,482 --> 00:30:53,243
But I'm glad... I'm glad you're
so friggin' happy about it.

627
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:54,751
I'm not.

628
00:30:55,921 --> 00:30:58,304
I'm not happy with any of it.

629
00:30:58,373 --> 00:31:00,874
I'm not happy that
everything I thought I was

630
00:31:00,943 --> 00:31:02,709
turns out not to be true.

631
00:31:02,778 --> 00:31:05,345
Um, I'm not a
board-certified surgeon.

632
00:31:05,414 --> 00:31:07,981
I'm not a virgin. I'm
not a good Christian.

633
00:31:08,049 --> 00:31:10,484
I don't know what I am,
but I know I'm not happy.

634
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:14,787
I loved having sex with you.

635
00:31:14,856 --> 00:31:16,940
You made me feel things...

636
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:20,577
You changed me, Jackson.

637
00:31:20,646 --> 00:31:22,312
And I loved that.

638
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:26,182
But I hate that I'm not a virgin

639
00:31:26,252 --> 00:31:27,584
for the man I'm gonna marry.

640
00:31:27,653 --> 00:31:30,169
I'm not freakin'
happy about that.

641
00:31:30,238 --> 00:31:33,272
And I'm really not happy
that you feel bad about it,

642
00:31:33,342 --> 00:31:35,475
'cause you're my best friend.

643
00:31:35,544 --> 00:31:37,060
But you know what?

644
00:31:37,129 --> 00:31:38,729
Torres is right.

645
00:31:40,532 --> 00:31:42,899
My problems will still
be my problems tomorrow

646
00:31:42,968 --> 00:31:45,402
and the day after that
and the day after that.

647
00:31:45,471 --> 00:31:46,903
And in a few weeks,

648
00:31:46,972 --> 00:31:48,905
my best friend
will be at Tulane,

649
00:31:48,974 --> 00:31:51,174
and I may never
see him again, so...

650
00:31:51,243 --> 00:31:54,744
For one night, I'm just
gonna forget all about that.

651
00:31:54,813 --> 00:31:57,080
And I'm gonna try.

652
00:31:57,149 --> 00:31:59,182
I'm gonna try to be happy.

653
00:32:00,819 --> 00:32:02,485
I'm happy tonight.

654
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:05,688
I am gonna be happy, Jackson,

655
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:07,357
'cause this is a happy time,

656
00:32:07,426 --> 00:32:09,159
and we should be
celebrating, okay?

657
00:32:09,228 --> 00:32:11,606
So can you please just wipe
that freakin' frown off your face

658
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:13,413
and be happy with me?

659
00:32:16,385 --> 00:32:18,150
You look really nice.

660
00:32:20,422 --> 00:32:21,788
So do you.

661
00:32:42,194 --> 00:32:43,738
<i>This is Dr. Robbins.</i>

662
00:32:43,762 --> 00:32:44,772
<i>Leave your name and
number, and I'll get back to you.</i>

663
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:46,241
<i>Thanks.</i>

664
00:32:46,265 --> 00:32:47,464
Hey, it's Alex.

665
00:32:47,533 --> 00:32:49,682
Listen, um...

666
00:32:49,751 --> 00:32:51,817
Look, the only reason
Hopkins wants me

667
00:32:51,886 --> 00:32:54,921
is because you
made me something.

668
00:32:54,989 --> 00:32:57,624
All right, you made me,
and I still don't know why.

669
00:32:57,692 --> 00:32:59,726
You said one time that
you saw something in me,

670
00:32:59,795 --> 00:33:02,562
and most of me
thinks you're nuts, but...

671
00:33:03,715 --> 00:33:05,982
I gotta go to Hopkins
'cause I gotta see

672
00:33:06,051 --> 00:33:08,718
if I'm something
when you're not there,

673
00:33:08,787 --> 00:33:11,054
holding my hand, you know?

674
00:33:11,122 --> 00:33:13,790
I guess I'm saying
thanks or whatever.

675
00:33:13,858 --> 00:33:15,592
I don't know.

676
00:33:15,661 --> 00:33:17,138
If you want to be
pissed about it,

677
00:33:17,162 --> 00:33:19,128
then be pissed about it.

678
00:33:19,798 --> 00:33:20,930
Bye.

679
00:33:23,768 --> 00:33:25,448
Hey, they don't
know where we are.

680
00:33:26,521 --> 00:33:27,721
They don't know where we are.

681
00:33:30,024 --> 00:33:32,458
It's because the transmitter's
probably been damaged

682
00:33:32,544 --> 00:33:34,144
in the crash.

683
00:33:34,213 --> 00:33:35,390
If the transmitter's damaged...

684
00:33:35,414 --> 00:33:36,494
We could be here for days.

685
00:33:38,384 --> 00:33:39,483
Yeah.

686
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:46,172
Zola.

687
00:33:53,748 --> 00:33:56,749
Owen has got to have
figured out we're missing.

688
00:33:57,852 --> 00:33:59,752
I know he sent someone.

689
00:34:08,997 --> 00:34:10,580
Mark?

690
00:34:10,632 --> 00:34:12,798
I shoulda said it earlier...

691
00:34:14,369 --> 00:34:16,920
That I loved her. I
shoulda said it earlier.

692
00:34:17,873 --> 00:34:19,372
She...

693
00:34:19,441 --> 00:34:20,707
She knew.

694
00:34:22,845 --> 00:34:24,077
I think she knew.

695
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:25,262
She didn't know.

696
00:34:26,782 --> 00:34:28,348
She didn't know.

697
00:34:32,287 --> 00:34:33,553
Mark...

698
00:34:33,622 --> 00:34:35,021
Mark, hold on.

699
00:34:35,089 --> 00:34:37,924
Okay, I need you... I
need you to hold on.

700
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:40,994
You'll be okay.

701
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:43,897
You don't need me.

702
00:34:45,567 --> 00:34:47,667
You take care of our girls.

703
00:34:47,736 --> 00:34:49,352
No. Shut up.

704
00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:51,821
Shut up. Do you
hear me? Shut up.

705
00:34:52,557 --> 00:34:55,158
Lexie's waiting for me.

706
00:34:57,496 --> 00:34:58,995
I'll be okay.

707
00:35:00,232 --> 00:35:02,549
No! Mark Sloan, no!

708
00:35:02,617 --> 00:35:04,584
Hey! No.

709
00:35:04,669 --> 00:35:07,670
No. Sofia's waiting for you,

710
00:35:07,739 --> 00:35:09,139
and Callie is waiting for you,

711
00:35:09,208 --> 00:35:11,208
and I am waiting for you.

712
00:35:14,113 --> 00:35:16,329
We're gonna go
home together, okay?

713
00:35:20,468 --> 00:35:21,534
Okay.

714
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:23,719
Okay.

715
00:35:23,789 --> 00:35:24,888
Okay.

716
00:35:25,757 --> 00:35:26,797
Okay.

717
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,326
Thank you.

718
00:35:30,395 --> 00:35:32,173
Hey. You were looking for me?

719
00:35:32,197 --> 00:35:34,117
We need to talk. No.

720
00:35:35,767 --> 00:35:38,418
We don't. I am happy to stay.

721
00:35:38,504 --> 00:35:39,981
It'll be fun. It'll
be like old times.

722
00:35:40,005 --> 00:35:42,567
Like you and me back
in Iraq. You're fired.

723
00:35:44,977 --> 00:35:47,493
That's good.
Effective immediately.

724
00:35:49,248 --> 00:35:52,098
Hunt... I wish
it were different,

725
00:35:52,167 --> 00:35:54,028
but this is just the way
things are shaking out.

726
00:35:54,052 --> 00:35:56,219
Now I know you have
other opportunities,

727
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:57,598
so if you need to make
those phone calls, then...

728
00:35:57,622 --> 00:35:59,600
Owen, stop it. Stop it.
You can't just do this.

729
00:35:59,624 --> 00:36:00,835
You can't... You can't just...

730
00:36:00,859 --> 00:36:02,125
I can and I did.

731
00:36:02,193 --> 00:36:04,238
You can't just... I already
e-mailed the board.

732
00:36:04,262 --> 00:36:05,540
You're already...
You can't just tell me

733
00:36:05,564 --> 00:36:06,830
when to go and when to stay!

734
00:36:06,898 --> 00:36:09,014
I don't want you here anymore!

735
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:12,836
You shoulda seen this coming.

736
00:36:12,905 --> 00:36:15,438
For months, for months, you
have been disruptive in the OR,

737
00:36:15,507 --> 00:36:17,690
you have been hostile
and insubordinate...

738
00:36:17,759 --> 00:36:18,937
Oh, my God. To
me in front of staff

739
00:36:18,961 --> 00:36:20,360
and in front of students.

740
00:36:20,429 --> 00:36:21,511
I can't have that.

741
00:36:21,579 --> 00:36:22,962
I am the Chief of Surgery.

742
00:36:23,031 --> 00:36:25,391
Owen, I was... I was... I was...

743
00:36:26,951 --> 00:36:28,191
We're past all of that.

744
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:30,637
We are, because you're fired.

745
00:36:33,525 --> 00:36:36,660
It's a done deal.
Pack your stuff.

746
00:36:36,728 --> 00:36:38,261
You son of a bitch.

747
00:36:38,329 --> 00:36:39,912
You son of a bitch!

748
00:36:39,981 --> 00:36:41,681
Damn it.

749
00:37:10,112 --> 00:37:11,711
You don't lose her.

750
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:14,220
You fight. You fight
for her. You hear me?

751
00:37:16,801 --> 00:37:18,000
You go.

752
00:37:19,404 --> 00:37:21,054
And you be great.

753
00:37:37,873 --> 00:37:40,873
You don't get to make
decisions on your own

754
00:37:40,942 --> 00:37:43,026
without a heads-up anymore.

755
00:37:43,095 --> 00:37:45,490
You don't say, "Uh, oh, maybe

756
00:37:45,514 --> 00:37:47,575
"I'll apply to be an intern,

757
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:49,365
"we'll see how it goes.

758
00:37:49,434 --> 00:37:51,701
"I'll bring it up with Miranda
if anything comes of it,

759
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:53,648
"but for now, it's
my little secret

760
00:37:53,672 --> 00:37:55,071
"between me and me."

761
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:57,373
That's not your life anymore.

762
00:37:57,442 --> 00:37:59,842
When you are sharing
your life with a person,

763
00:37:59,911 --> 00:38:03,046
you talk to them,
you think with them,

764
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:05,048
you make decisions with them,

765
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:07,716
you are loyal to them.

766
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:11,105
You are not a free agent
anymore. Do you understand me?

767
00:38:12,056 --> 00:38:13,500
Does this mean we're
still getting married?

768
00:38:13,524 --> 00:38:15,558
Well, what do you...

769
00:38:16,561 --> 00:38:18,728
I proposed to you!

770
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:20,630
In a trench coat and a thong,

771
00:38:20,698 --> 00:38:23,516
proving once again that no
good can ever come from a thong,

772
00:38:23,585 --> 00:38:26,385
but here I am, proposing again.

773
00:38:26,454 --> 00:38:28,154
What, you want a skywriter?

774
00:38:28,222 --> 00:38:30,022
It was clear with the
coat and the thong.

775
00:38:30,091 --> 00:38:33,960
You know what? You put
a piece of string in your tail

776
00:38:34,028 --> 00:38:35,690
and see if you
want to do it twice.

777
00:38:35,714 --> 00:38:37,992
You know, this may be the most
romantic conversation of my life.

778
00:38:38,016 --> 00:38:39,827
Well, I'm not proposing
romance, mister.

779
00:38:39,851 --> 00:38:42,971
I'm proposing marriage,
and if you're not prepared to...

780
00:38:48,726 --> 00:38:49,826
You love me, don't you?

781
00:38:50,962 --> 00:38:54,230
I am very angry with you.

782
00:38:54,299 --> 00:38:57,299
So pissed, you're just gonna
marry me, just to spite me.

783
00:38:57,369 --> 00:38:59,235
Yes. Exactly.

784
00:39:07,846 --> 00:39:09,812
Tell me it's gonna be okay.

785
00:39:11,282 --> 00:39:13,249
It's gonna be wonderful.

786
00:39:20,892 --> 00:39:22,224
<i>Good morning, Dr. Hunt.</i>

787
00:39:22,293 --> 00:39:24,005
<i>This is Dr. Sheehan
over at Boise Memorial.</i>

788
00:39:24,029 --> 00:39:25,940
<i>I just wanted to double-check
what time your surgeons</i>

789
00:39:25,964 --> 00:39:27,931
<i>were set to arrive today.</i>

790
00:39:28,883 --> 00:39:29,883
Okay.

791
00:39:31,018 --> 00:39:33,152
<i>Dr. Hunt, Dr. Sheehan again.</i>

792
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:34,765
<i>Still no word from
your surgeons.</i>

793
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:36,400
<i>I'm gonna check
in with the airport</i>

794
00:39:36,424 --> 00:39:38,825
<i>to see if the
weather held 'em up.</i>

795
00:39:47,519 --> 00:39:49,385
Uh, any word from Yang or Grey?

796
00:39:49,454 --> 00:39:52,688
No. Plane should've landed
an hour ago. They'll show.

797
00:39:53,425 --> 00:39:55,407
Well, you know...

798
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:57,205
There's a little bit of advice

799
00:39:57,229 --> 00:39:59,123
I like to give at these
dinners every year.

800
00:39:59,147 --> 00:40:01,380
It's a secret that
will help all of you

801
00:40:01,449 --> 00:40:04,250
get through the
challenges that lie ahead.

802
00:40:11,526 --> 00:40:13,993
You know, um...

803
00:40:14,062 --> 00:40:15,928
We should wait
for the rest of them.

804
00:40:25,823 --> 00:40:27,557
<i>This is Dr. Sheehan again.</i>

805
00:40:27,626 --> 00:40:30,460
<i>We're starting to get
a bit concerned here.</i>

806
00:40:39,004 --> 00:40:40,703
I'm hungry.

807
00:40:40,772 --> 00:40:42,738
Think of something else.

808
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:46,859
I'm hungry.

809
00:40:48,329 --> 00:40:50,830
I have a stick of gum.

810
00:40:50,899 --> 00:40:53,165
I don't want gum. I want food.

811
00:40:54,018 --> 00:40:56,686
Oh. Shoot.

812
00:41:02,761 --> 00:41:05,277
Great. We have one match left.

813
00:41:06,815 --> 00:41:08,514
Hey. No sleeping.

814
00:41:08,583 --> 00:41:10,127
Yeah. You have to stay awake.

815
00:41:10,151 --> 00:41:11,568
Okay.

816
00:41:11,636 --> 00:41:13,937
Derek. Derek. Mmm.

817
00:41:14,005 --> 00:41:16,522
You, too. I want
everyone conscious!

818
00:41:21,212 --> 00:41:22,995
Mer, light the match.

819
00:41:24,065 --> 00:41:26,132
Careful. It's our last one.

820
00:41:28,787 --> 00:41:29,986
Okay.

821
00:41:57,115 --> 00:41:59,648
<i>The years we spend
as surgical residents</i>

822
00:41:59,717 --> 00:42:01,134
<i>will be the best</i>

823
00:42:01,202 --> 00:42:03,102
<i>and worst of our lives.</i>

824
00:42:04,639 --> 00:42:07,340
<i>We will be pushed
to our breaking point.</i>

825
00:42:09,811 --> 00:42:11,844
<i>This is the starting line.</i>

826
00:42:13,114 --> 00:42:14,781
<i>This is our arena.</i>

827
00:42:17,969 --> 00:42:21,604
<i>How well we play,
that's up to us.</i>
