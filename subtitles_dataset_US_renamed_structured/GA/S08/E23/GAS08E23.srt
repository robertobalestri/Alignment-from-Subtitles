1
00:00:02,753 --> 00:00:04,536
<i>So there's this bird,</i>

2
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:07,739
<i>some sort of swallow, I think.</i>

3
00:00:07,807 --> 00:00:09,124
Where are we with Avery?

4
00:00:09,192 --> 00:00:11,593
Holding offers from USC,
Penn, Tulane, and Emory.

5
00:00:11,662 --> 00:00:13,761
Tulane and Emory are in
love. They want him bad.

6
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:15,764
<i>Every September,
thousands of 'em</i>

7
00:00:15,833 --> 00:00:17,749
<i>ditch rainy Seattle
to winter in Mexico.</i>

8
00:00:17,818 --> 00:00:18,862
Grey?

9
00:00:18,886 --> 00:00:19,968
<i>These birds aren't dumb.</i>

10
00:00:20,054 --> 00:00:21,698
Uh... Still between
Boston and Seattle.

11
00:00:21,722 --> 00:00:23,215
If I'm gonna lose one
of my talented residents

12
00:00:23,239 --> 00:00:24,383
and my top neurosurgeon,

13
00:00:24,407 --> 00:00:26,269
I'd love a decision
sooner than later.

14
00:00:26,293 --> 00:00:27,625
You and me both, Hunt.

15
00:00:28,345 --> 00:00:29,585
Yang?

16
00:00:32,199 --> 00:00:34,282
She didn't tell you?

17
00:00:34,351 --> 00:00:36,779
Stanford and Columbia
are playing hardball,

18
00:00:36,803 --> 00:00:38,581
but I'm confident that
we're still in the mix.

19
00:00:38,605 --> 00:00:41,640
<i>And every year, crowds of
people gather around Seattle</i>

20
00:00:41,709 --> 00:00:43,603
<i>to drink beer and
watch the flocks take off.</i>

21
00:00:43,627 --> 00:00:44,721
Lee, Steinman, and Renaldo?

22
00:00:44,745 --> 00:00:46,322
Offer from Rice.
Leaning toward Wash U.

23
00:00:46,346 --> 00:00:48,964
Baylor and San Diego
are both after him.

24
00:00:49,033 --> 00:00:51,166
<i>They call it "The
Great Migration."</i>

25
00:00:51,234 --> 00:00:53,251
Well, Karev is staying.

26
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:58,957
If we are out this many surgeons,
I'm gonna need to hire now,

27
00:00:59,025 --> 00:01:00,937
so let's get answers
from our people

28
00:01:00,961 --> 00:01:02,823
as soon as possible. Thank you.

29
00:01:02,847 --> 00:01:06,031
And let's not forget that we've
agreed to assist Boise Memorial

30
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,799
with their conjoined
twin surgery,

31
00:01:07,867 --> 00:01:09,913
so make sure your teams are
ready to leave from the lobby

32
00:01:09,937 --> 00:01:12,120
no later than 10:00
tomorrow night.

33
00:01:19,146 --> 00:01:21,196
You should be proud.

34
00:01:21,264 --> 00:01:22,508
You trained these kids well.

35
00:01:22,532 --> 00:01:24,052
You should be proud.
You trained 'em.

36
00:01:24,835 --> 00:01:27,402
Yeah. I sure did.

37
00:01:32,576 --> 00:01:34,142
We did it!

38
00:01:35,412 --> 00:01:36,745
We passed our boards!

39
00:01:36,814 --> 00:01:38,196
We killed the boards!

40
00:01:41,218 --> 00:01:43,396
I just think it's weird that
we're not even talking about it.

41
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:44,580
You know, things
are unresolved here.

42
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:48,223
We're still friends.
It's all good, Jackman.

43
00:01:48,292 --> 00:01:51,209
I love this song!
Whoo! Excuse me!

44
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:53,077
Kepner's wasted. That's a first.

45
00:01:54,998 --> 00:01:58,398
Yeah, well, lately, she's
been all about firsts.

46
00:02:00,503 --> 00:02:02,387
Yeah!

47
00:02:04,191 --> 00:02:05,407
Wait, wait, wait.

48
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,946
This is Dr. Yang.

49
00:02:11,882 --> 00:02:12,882
Mmm-hmm.

50
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:15,900
Mmm-hmm.

51
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:18,264
Well, that does certainly
give me a lot to think about.

52
00:02:18,288 --> 00:02:20,569
Thank you so much for calling.

53
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:24,103
Mayo wants to give
me a research lab.

54
00:02:24,127 --> 00:02:26,022
Guess who's back in the running!

55
00:02:30,366 --> 00:02:31,866
Yeah, Cristina!

56
00:02:31,935 --> 00:02:32,935
April!

57
00:02:34,671 --> 00:02:36,231
So that's what rock
bottom looks like.

58
00:02:39,026 --> 00:02:40,541
Music. Music.

59
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:47,171
Hello? Yes, this is she.

60
00:02:47,768 --> 00:02:49,008
Uh-huh...

61
00:02:50,353 --> 00:02:51,593
Uh-huh...

62
00:02:52,072 --> 00:02:53,372
Okay.

63
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,640
Well, yes, thank you. Thank you.

64
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:58,069
Thank you so much
for the opportunity.

65
00:03:00,664 --> 00:03:04,166
UVA wants a board-certified
surgeon, so they pulled my offer.

66
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:06,918
Come on. Music!

67
00:03:06,987 --> 00:03:08,537
Come on. Come on.

68
00:03:10,891 --> 00:03:13,358
Music! Come on!

69
00:03:13,427 --> 00:03:14,907
Yes!

70
00:03:46,227 --> 00:03:47,325
Cristina?

71
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:57,068
What are you doing?

72
00:03:57,905 --> 00:03:59,604
I don't know.

73
00:04:05,362 --> 00:04:07,562
Are you drunk? I don't know.

74
00:04:43,466 --> 00:04:45,411
We got one whole day.

75
00:04:45,435 --> 00:04:48,214
Tuck's with his dad. I think
we should make the most of it.

76
00:04:48,238 --> 00:04:51,734
Sargent exhibit at the
museum, Pike Place,

77
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:54,287
maybe watch the
sunset over the water.

78
00:04:54,311 --> 00:04:56,144
Twelve whole hours
to get to know the city

79
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:58,597
that you have lived in
for the past 10 years,

80
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:01,249
but still have yet to...

81
00:05:01,317 --> 00:05:03,902
No. No, no, no, no, no. You
are supposed to be naked.

82
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:06,649
Okay, well, the
hospital just called.

83
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:10,842
A stomach perf with intestinal
obstruction and an enlarged liver.

84
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:12,739
They don't know
what's causing it.

85
00:05:12,763 --> 00:05:13,795
Uh...

86
00:05:13,864 --> 00:05:16,024
Could be fun. You want to come?

87
00:05:18,034 --> 00:05:19,295
So, how much longer do I have?

88
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,353
Don't tiptoe around.
Just give it to me straight.

89
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:23,571
Jake, you're not dying.
He can be a little neurotic.

90
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,218
We're hoping we'll be able to
figure out more during your surgery.

91
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:28,604
Well, do you think it's
something that I picked up abroad,

92
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:31,379
like Ebola or something? We
were just on our honeymoon.

93
00:05:31,448 --> 00:05:33,626
You two just got married?

94
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:35,211
You seem like you've
been together a while.

95
00:05:35,235 --> 00:05:37,069
It's our third in 12
years. Honeymoon.

96
00:05:37,137 --> 00:05:38,331
We went to Kauai the first time.

97
00:05:38,355 --> 00:05:39,604
Oh, beautiful.

98
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:41,406
Yeah, then we got divorced.

99
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:42,501
Then we went to Fiji the
next time. The beaches.

100
00:05:42,525 --> 00:05:44,045
Yeah, and then we got divorced.

101
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:46,306
This time, my bride,
she insisted on Thailand.

102
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:48,290
We just can't seem to
stay away from each other.

103
00:05:50,801 --> 00:05:52,761
Congratulations. Yeah.

104
00:05:54,037 --> 00:05:56,332
So, this patch
here is your tumor.

105
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,484
It's invading the wall
of your right ventricle.

106
00:05:58,508 --> 00:06:00,925
What we'll do is,
we'll resect the tumor,

107
00:06:00,994 --> 00:06:04,324
then repair the ventricle,
and replace the tricuspid valve.

108
00:06:04,348 --> 00:06:06,314
Dr. Yang is the
best that we have.

109
00:06:06,383 --> 00:06:08,360
You couldn't be in better hands.

110
00:06:08,384 --> 00:06:09,901
Come on.

111
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:11,536
Where is she?

112
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:13,421
Arizona? She's... Um...

113
00:06:15,058 --> 00:06:18,760
Patients. So many patients.

114
00:06:18,828 --> 00:06:21,312
So, basically,

115
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:24,866
you all want to chop up my
heart into a jigsaw puzzle.

116
00:06:24,935 --> 00:06:27,351
It may give me a
few more months,

117
00:06:27,421 --> 00:06:30,889
most of which, I'll be
spending in a hospital bed,

118
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:33,086
while my best
friend in the world

119
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:35,727
does everything
possible to avoid me?

120
00:06:35,796 --> 00:06:38,429
Or, I spend the
rest of my short life

121
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:41,082
lying on a sandy
beach in Belize.

122
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,968
Nick, you need this surgery.

123
00:06:43,036 --> 00:06:45,516
Tell Scottsdale I said goodbye.

124
00:06:47,957 --> 00:06:50,077
Looks like I won't
get the chance.

125
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:56,175
Hunt needs to know
where we are on Boston,

126
00:06:56,199 --> 00:06:58,610
and I gotta let Harvard know
what I'm doing by the end of the day.

127
00:06:58,634 --> 00:07:00,113
We're not going. Anything
else you need to know?

128
00:07:00,137 --> 00:07:01,898
I may have told you, I have
family on the East Coast.

129
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:03,149
A couple of times.

130
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:04,934
And I may have replied
that my sister lives here,

131
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:07,520
and if Cristina chooses
Stanford, it's a two-hour plane ride.

132
00:07:07,544 --> 00:07:10,796
But if she chooses Columbia,
it's only a two-hour train ride.

133
00:07:11,832 --> 00:07:13,314
We're not going.

134
00:07:13,383 --> 00:07:14,778
They want me to run the
neurosurgery department at Harvard.

135
00:07:14,802 --> 00:07:16,228
Webber loves me,
and Bailey loves me.

136
00:07:16,252 --> 00:07:19,020
I will be teaching the
best fellows in the world.

137
00:07:19,089 --> 00:07:20,988
We are staying. We're leaving.

138
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:27,445
Here you go, Apes.

139
00:07:27,514 --> 00:07:29,058
I was thinking I could
take the trauma rooms,

140
00:07:29,082 --> 00:07:31,183
and we could split the beds.

141
00:07:31,251 --> 00:07:34,152
I can handle trauma,
Alex. It was one phone call.

142
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,765
It doesn't mean I
can't practice medicine.

143
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:37,884
I still have three great
hospitals who want me.

144
00:07:37,908 --> 00:07:38,957
Of course they do, Apes.

145
00:07:39,026 --> 00:07:40,069
Don't call me "Apes."

146
00:07:40,093 --> 00:07:41,333
Karev, come here.

147
00:07:44,247 --> 00:07:45,791
You're gonna get a
phone call in a few minutes,

148
00:07:45,815 --> 00:07:47,477
and not just any phone call.

149
00:07:47,501 --> 00:07:49,295
It's from Keith Collier. I
don't know any Keith Colliers.

150
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:50,629
He was one of your
examiners at the boards.

151
00:07:50,653 --> 00:07:52,887
Oh, crap. I failed, didn't I?

152
00:07:52,956 --> 00:07:54,417
They changed their
minds. Son of a...

153
00:07:54,441 --> 00:07:57,203
Karev, Karev, Keith is
a good friend of mine.

154
00:07:57,227 --> 00:08:00,239
Now whatever you told him at
the boards really impressed him.

155
00:08:00,263 --> 00:08:02,542
I mean, really impressed him.

156
00:08:02,566 --> 00:08:06,500
He wants to offer you a peds
surgery fellowship at Hopkins.

157
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:08,769
Hopkins has the best
program in the country.

158
00:08:08,838 --> 00:08:11,039
They've already chosen
their fellows for next year.

159
00:08:11,107 --> 00:08:12,902
Which is what makes
this so extraordinary.

160
00:08:12,926 --> 00:08:15,004
They're adding a
position just for Karev.

161
00:08:15,028 --> 00:08:16,044
Oh.

162
00:08:17,347 --> 00:08:19,680
This is you playing some
kind of practical joke,

163
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:20,893
then at the end,
you're gonna tell me

164
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:22,650
I learned something
when I really haven't.

165
00:08:22,719 --> 00:08:26,239
I am not joking. I have
no skin in this game.

166
00:08:27,024 --> 00:08:28,206
Hopkins is the dream.

167
00:08:28,275 --> 00:08:30,509
I know.

168
00:08:30,577 --> 00:08:32,421
It's really not cool to screw
with somebody's head like this.

169
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:34,079
You know that. I know.

170
00:08:34,147 --> 00:08:36,547
Make sure your ringer's on.

171
00:08:48,595 --> 00:08:49,789
He's full of crap.

172
00:08:49,813 --> 00:08:50,928
I don't think so.

173
00:08:59,573 --> 00:09:00,573
I'm over this.

174
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:22,988
Cristina, I made a
decision. You have?

175
00:09:23,012 --> 00:09:24,490
You're going to Stanford.

176
00:09:24,514 --> 00:09:25,925
Oh, you've made my decision.

177
00:09:25,949 --> 00:09:27,860
There's no way you're
going to Columbia.

178
00:09:27,884 --> 00:09:29,762
And Mayo's in Minnesota. Please.

179
00:09:29,786 --> 00:09:32,431
And since we're staying here,
Stanford's only a couple of hours away.

180
00:09:32,455 --> 00:09:33,933
You'll come up.
I'll bring Zola down.

181
00:09:33,957 --> 00:09:35,367
We can get drunk
on the weekends.

182
00:09:35,391 --> 00:09:36,919
Okay, maybe I
shouldn't bring Zola.

183
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:38,659
Hey! There you are.

184
00:09:38,728 --> 00:09:40,506
Is there anything you want to
go over on the conjoined twins

185
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:41,808
before you head out to Boise?

186
00:09:41,832 --> 00:09:43,615
No. I'm good. You sure?

187
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:45,695
'Cause you're gonna be the
sole cardiothoracic surgeon

188
00:09:45,719 --> 00:09:46,962
representing Seattle Grace.

189
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:48,954
Which, you know,
is kind of unheard of

190
00:09:49,022 --> 00:09:51,489
for an attending to
allow her fellow to do.

191
00:09:51,558 --> 00:09:54,626
But that's just the kind
of faith I have in you.

192
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:56,389
Technically, I'm
not a fellow yet.

193
00:09:56,413 --> 00:09:57,779
I know. Right?

194
00:09:57,848 --> 00:09:59,191
I mean, so just think
about all the things

195
00:09:59,215 --> 00:10:00,626
that you're gonna be
able to do when you are.

196
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:03,935
Tip of the iceberg,
Yang. I'm proud of you.

197
00:10:04,004 --> 00:10:05,815
You haven't even
told her you're leaving?

198
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,123
I haven't decided yet
where I'm going. You just did.

199
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:11,112
Stanford. ALEX: Hopkins!

200
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:13,244
Hopkins is not in the running.

201
00:10:13,313 --> 00:10:14,745
Not for you.

202
00:10:14,815 --> 00:10:17,348
For me. Hopkins.
Hopkins wants me.

203
00:10:17,417 --> 00:10:18,633
Hopkins wants me!

204
00:10:20,236 --> 00:10:22,648
Johns Hopkins, the
hospital? Alex, how?

205
00:10:22,672 --> 00:10:24,233
Not Hopkins
Refrigeration School?

206
00:10:24,257 --> 00:10:26,836
I kind of bitched out their
chief of surgery at my boards,

207
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,487
and I guess he was impressed.

208
00:10:28,511 --> 00:10:29,961
So they know you're a jerk?

209
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:34,115
They totally know, and they
want me. Hopkins wants me.

210
00:10:34,183 --> 00:10:35,294
I'm not surprised at all.

211
00:10:35,318 --> 00:10:37,635
I am 100% surprised.

212
00:10:38,855 --> 00:10:39,871
Hey.

213
00:10:43,176 --> 00:10:44,376
Nice work, evil spawn.

214
00:10:48,548 --> 00:10:49,564
Whoo!

215
00:10:49,632 --> 00:10:51,632
Yes! Hopkins!

216
00:10:51,701 --> 00:10:53,601
The stomach's
adhered to the bowel,

217
00:10:53,669 --> 00:10:54,947
and look at the
size of this liver.

218
00:10:54,971 --> 00:10:56,465
You know, this is one
for the record book.

219
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,033
We should be taking
pictures. We really should.

220
00:10:58,057 --> 00:10:59,335
Sure. Let's take a break.

221
00:10:59,359 --> 00:11:00,470
Maybe someone
could find a camera.

222
00:11:00,494 --> 00:11:02,138
We got all the
time in the world.

223
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:04,089
We do have all the time in the
world. This is my only case today.

224
00:11:04,113 --> 00:11:06,125
Because it's your day off.

225
00:11:06,149 --> 00:11:08,060
I'll have another day off.

226
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:10,296
I made a lunch reservation. I
even brought the crossword.

227
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,880
We could skip the
crossword for one week.

228
00:11:11,904 --> 00:11:14,588
Oh, that's not right.

229
00:11:14,657 --> 00:11:16,986
What in the name of
chickens is going on here?

230
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,120
Is it Crohn's Disease?

231
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:19,922
Maybe it's just a mystery.

232
00:11:19,946 --> 00:11:22,308
Maybe Lee Harvey Oswald's
magic bullet's been dancing around

233
00:11:22,332 --> 00:11:24,426
in Mr. Steiner's
intestines for 50 years.

234
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:26,295
Sometimes we just
never figure it out.

235
00:11:26,319 --> 00:11:28,614
You marvel at the wonder
of it all while you sew 'em up,

236
00:11:28,638 --> 00:11:30,638
and you go eat lunch.

237
00:11:30,707 --> 00:11:32,067
Is it a metabolic syndrome?

238
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:33,107
Mmm-mmm.

239
00:11:33,176 --> 00:11:34,809
Oh, maybe it's autoimmune.

240
00:11:38,782 --> 00:11:40,748
What did you tell Keith?

241
00:11:40,817 --> 00:11:42,737
- Uh... Finish up.
- Yes, sir.

242
00:11:49,259 --> 00:11:52,070
I told him I needed a
day or two to think about it.

243
00:11:52,094 --> 00:11:53,906
But, I made a
commitment to Robbins.

244
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:55,308
I don't know what I'm
doing here. I'm freaking out.

245
00:11:55,332 --> 00:11:56,764
What's Hopkins
giving salary-wise?

246
00:11:56,833 --> 00:11:58,299
It's competitive.

247
00:11:58,367 --> 00:12:01,769
They throw in a loan-repayment
package, moving expenses?

248
00:12:01,838 --> 00:12:04,238
You did the whole Africa thing.

249
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:07,642
Tell me you at least asked
for an international rotation.

250
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:09,738
Oh, Karev. Look, it's not
like I have any leverage.

251
00:12:09,762 --> 00:12:11,407
And these are two of the
best programs in the country.

252
00:12:11,431 --> 00:12:13,131
Who both want you.

253
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,677
And now's the time
to shake 'em down.

254
00:12:14,701 --> 00:12:16,151
I mean, pit 'em
against each other.

255
00:12:16,219 --> 00:12:18,063
You call Hopkins back
and tell 'em what you want,

256
00:12:18,087 --> 00:12:20,688
and then get Hunt's ass down here
and give him the same demands.

257
00:12:20,757 --> 00:12:21,834
What if he doesn't
want to play ball?

258
00:12:21,858 --> 00:12:23,236
If he doesn't have
the money, he doesn't.

259
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:24,725
He has the money.

260
00:12:24,794 --> 00:12:26,605
And when he lies and says
that he doesn't have the money,

261
00:12:26,629 --> 00:12:28,112
and he will lie...

262
00:12:28,181 --> 00:12:29,842
You're not doing your job
as the chief if you don't lie.

263
00:12:29,866 --> 00:12:34,568
You tell him you know about
his incidentals and overhead fund.

264
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:37,499
Incidentals and overhead fund.

265
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:38,890
Exactly.

266
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:42,860
You say those four
little words, and I promise

267
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:45,597
the kingdom will be yours.

268
00:12:53,373 --> 00:12:55,573
How's Julia? You
impregnate her yet?

269
00:12:55,641 --> 00:12:58,054
No, I was all ready
to, but then Lexie...

270
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:00,790
Oh, she told me she
was in love with me.

271
00:13:00,814 --> 00:13:02,130
Ooh. What did you say?

272
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:03,526
I said, "Thank you
for your candor."

273
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:04,916
"Thank you for your candor"?

274
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:06,328
What was I supposed to do?

275
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:09,086
Oh, I don't know. Kiss her.

276
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:11,300
Julia's away on a
conference. I'm not a cheater.

277
00:13:11,324 --> 00:13:13,224
Usually. Mmm.

278
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:15,760
Look, I owe it to
the both of them to...

279
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:17,906
I don't want to mess
this one up, okay?

280
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:20,264
Julia wants to give
me everything I want.

281
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:22,733
But I'm in love with Lexie, who
doesn't want anything I want.

282
00:13:24,621 --> 00:13:26,254
Dr. Shepherd. Dr. Sloan.

283
00:13:26,322 --> 00:13:29,073
Lexie, come on in.
Plenty of room. Oh. Uh...

284
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:31,620
Actually, I was just gonna update
you on the Boise doctors' bios,

285
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,388
but since you're both here,
I'm just gonna give it to you,

286
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:36,247
and then that way, I can leave.

287
00:13:45,308 --> 00:13:49,260
Oh, no. You guys
go. I'm gonna stay.

288
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:51,195
Hey, Lexie, about
that other thing,

289
00:13:51,264 --> 00:13:53,197
don't think I forgot
what you said.

290
00:13:53,266 --> 00:13:54,586
I just need to ruminate on that.

291
00:13:54,634 --> 00:13:55,911
You know? Run it
up the old flagpole?

292
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:56,935
Okay.

293
00:14:00,407 --> 00:14:03,219
You know, it's too bad Meredith
and I are moving to Boston.

294
00:14:03,243 --> 00:14:05,176
I'm gonna miss this.

295
00:14:05,245 --> 00:14:06,494
Hey, you got a second?

296
00:14:06,563 --> 00:14:08,574
'Cause I cannot figure out
what to do about Tulane,

297
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:10,576
and there's this whole other
thing that happened at the boards.

298
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,560
I mean, it's all kind of
thrown me for a loop.

299
00:14:21,094 --> 00:14:22,638
Aww. Look at that. She's cute.

300
00:14:22,662 --> 00:14:24,156
Must be nice in here with
all these cute little babies.

301
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:25,680
Yeah.

302
00:14:25,749 --> 00:14:27,069
Is she dying, like, right now?

303
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:29,701
'Cause Nick is.

304
00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:32,520
Remember Nick, your
brother's best friend,

305
00:14:32,589 --> 00:14:34,955
your rock, who is
right now packing up

306
00:14:35,024 --> 00:14:36,669
and bailing on a surgery
that he needs to live

307
00:14:36,693 --> 00:14:38,337
because you can't get your
stubborn head out of your ass

308
00:14:38,361 --> 00:14:40,022
and let go of the fact that
he didn't come to you sooner?

309
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:41,757
Callie, I... No, I don't get it.

310
00:14:41,781 --> 00:14:43,248
You watch babies die every day.

311
00:14:43,316 --> 00:14:45,228
When things looked bad for
me, you didn't leave my side.

312
00:14:45,252 --> 00:14:47,551
And now your best
friend's asking for you.

313
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:50,537
Look, you need to get your
crap together before he leaves,

314
00:14:51,707 --> 00:14:53,541
because if he goes
now, he is gone.

315
00:14:58,330 --> 00:14:59,358
She's not actually
dying, is she?

316
00:14:59,382 --> 00:15:00,382
No.

317
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:01,966
Okay, good.

318
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:03,879
You said you'd know
more once you got in there.

319
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,403
We hoped we'd know more.

320
00:15:05,472 --> 00:15:07,872
Unfortunately, we weren't
able to find the cause.

321
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:09,290
But the good news is,

322
00:15:09,358 --> 00:15:10,887
we were able to repair all
the damage to your abdomen.

323
00:15:10,911 --> 00:15:13,021
What's the point if you
don't know what's doing it?

324
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:14,290
Something is eating my insides.

325
00:15:14,314 --> 00:15:15,808
Maybe it's stress, you know?

326
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:17,476
You're so worried about
the worst-case scenario,

327
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,778
you finally made it happen.

328
00:15:18,802 --> 00:15:21,185
Okay, coral can poison
you. That's a known fact.

329
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:23,315
And look at you. I told you
not to pet those monkeys.

330
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,790
What? It's a rash. It's
not from the monkeys.

331
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:28,162
Please take a look at her
arm? It's been there for weeks.

332
00:15:29,311 --> 00:15:30,556
Where did you say you
honeymooned again?

333
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:31,963
Thailand.

334
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:33,815
Where pigs walk
around inside restaurants.

335
00:15:33,883 --> 00:15:34,994
It's called local color.

336
00:15:35,018 --> 00:15:36,968
It's unsanitary.

337
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:38,313
Life is unsanitary. That's what
makes it fun, for God sakes.

338
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:40,017
Mrs. Steiner, please hold still.

339
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:41,940
What is this here?

340
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:45,225
Is that... Right there.

341
00:15:45,294 --> 00:15:46,627
That's

342
00:15:47,096 --> 00:15:48,162
a worm.

343
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,677
Good news.

344
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:53,768
I think we found what's
eating your insides.

345
00:16:04,814 --> 00:16:06,381
Whoa.

346
00:16:06,449 --> 00:16:09,233
That's a nasty
critter. Raw fish?

347
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:11,753
Sushi in Thailand
from a train station.

348
00:16:11,821 --> 00:16:13,215
I'm looking for more
damage. Want to help?

349
00:16:13,239 --> 00:16:16,741
No. I'm gonna cancel
our lunch reservation.

350
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,643
Are you really still
moping about lunch?

351
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:21,528
I had a plan. We had a day!

352
00:16:21,598 --> 00:16:25,132
Ben, there is a gnathostoma
worm in this man's body.

353
00:16:25,218 --> 00:16:28,836
These things eat through the
viscera, migrate through the tissue.

354
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:31,150
This is a
once-in-a-lifetime parasite.

355
00:16:31,174 --> 00:16:33,418
I'm sorry if I find it a little
more interesting right now

356
00:16:33,442 --> 00:16:35,576
than the crossword
and garden salad.

357
00:16:35,644 --> 00:16:37,795
The patient is
on antiparasitics.

358
00:16:37,864 --> 00:16:39,330
The worm is going to die.

359
00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:40,781
What...

360
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:42,130
There's nothing else you can do

361
00:16:42,184 --> 00:16:43,446
right now, other
than go to lunch.

362
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:45,402
This is not like
one of your movies

363
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:47,321
where the larvae
gestate in the brain,

364
00:16:47,389 --> 00:16:49,590
leaving the poor host
a hollowed-out zombie

365
00:16:49,659 --> 00:16:52,093
whose bite will now infect the
whole populace on the base.

366
00:16:52,161 --> 00:16:53,689
What movie is that? What?

367
00:16:53,713 --> 00:16:55,157
No, that sounds
good. I haven't seen it.

368
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:56,313
I made it up.

369
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:57,465
Oh, man!

370
00:17:03,906 --> 00:17:05,684
Okay, let's see now. There's...

371
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:06,708
Ooh.

372
00:17:07,376 --> 00:17:08,926
Oh, man.

373
00:17:08,995 --> 00:17:10,294
You made a commitment.

374
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:12,063
Technically, that was
a verbal agreement.

375
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:13,881
I never signed a contract.

376
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:16,428
I would like to think that your
word is as good as a contract.

377
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:19,920
Normally, yeah,
but this is Hopkins.

378
00:17:22,475 --> 00:17:24,053
I just think you should know
what they're offering me.

379
00:17:24,077 --> 00:17:25,409
Oh, really, like what?

380
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:31,582
Like moving expenses.

381
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:33,418
You live here. True.

382
00:17:33,486 --> 00:17:37,571
But this is the extra dough
that Hopkins was willing to offer.

383
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,258
I'm just asking you to add
that on to my new salary.

384
00:17:40,326 --> 00:17:42,710
Karev, even if I
wanted to, I couldn't.

385
00:17:42,779 --> 00:17:46,864
That budget is already set.
We don't have the dough. Okay?

386
00:17:46,933 --> 00:17:48,499
Maybe you should
recheck that budget.

387
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:52,052
You know, see what
you got lying around

388
00:17:52,121 --> 00:17:53,921
in your incidentals
and overhead fund.

389
00:18:01,096 --> 00:18:03,175
I don't know what
you're talking about.

390
00:18:03,199 --> 00:18:04,698
Oh, I think you do.

391
00:18:22,902 --> 00:18:24,385
We can add Spaghetti Wednesday

392
00:18:24,453 --> 00:18:26,465
to the list of things I'm not
gonna miss about this place.

393
00:18:26,489 --> 00:18:28,033
Are you kidding?
Best deal in town.

394
00:18:28,057 --> 00:18:29,968
I've watched Alex go
through six bowls already.

395
00:18:29,992 --> 00:18:31,442
True that.

396
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:33,405
Hey, I hear Stanford
has a farm-to-table chef.

397
00:18:33,429 --> 00:18:35,173
You can text your
order right from the OR.

398
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:37,631
I'll factor that in. I still
haven't made my decision.

399
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,067
Well, it's gotta be Stanford.
Where else would you go?

400
00:18:40,136 --> 00:18:42,136
I don't know. I might stay.

401
00:18:42,471 --> 00:18:43,582
Everything's on the table.

402
00:18:43,606 --> 00:18:45,656
She like-a the spaghetti, too.

403
00:18:45,725 --> 00:18:48,236
Tulane's got crawfish. I
mean, that's a selling point.

404
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,721
USC, I mean, what
do they eat in LA?

405
00:18:49,745 --> 00:18:50,795
Souls.

406
00:18:52,915 --> 00:18:54,835
2-1-2. It's New
York. Mount Sinai.

407
00:18:55,317 --> 00:18:56,333
Answer it.

408
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:59,950
Bad news is only bad news
if you pick up the phone.

409
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:04,636
April Kepner speaking. Cristina.

410
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:07,127
Oh, really? Okay.

411
00:19:07,196 --> 00:19:08,896
Okay.

412
00:19:08,964 --> 00:19:10,464
Oh, my gosh. Okay.

413
00:19:10,533 --> 00:19:13,233
No, no, no, no. No, thank you.

414
00:19:13,302 --> 00:19:15,647
They didn't pull my
offer? Oh, no. They did.

415
00:19:15,671 --> 00:19:17,182
I just figured that's
what you'd sound like

416
00:19:17,206 --> 00:19:18,446
in the face of rejection.

417
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:22,671
Hey, you want my fries, Apes?

418
00:19:22,695 --> 00:19:23,775
Not if they're pity fries.

419
00:19:23,812 --> 00:19:25,246
They taste the same.

420
00:19:25,315 --> 00:19:27,543
No, you still got Case
Western and Seattle, right?

421
00:19:27,567 --> 00:19:29,100
You're gonna be fine.

422
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,496
So what does Sloan
think about Tulane?

423
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,997
He hasn't weighed in
one way or the other.

424
00:19:32,021 --> 00:19:33,215
There's something
wrong with him.

425
00:19:33,239 --> 00:19:34,933
I think he's disturbed
or something.

426
00:19:34,957 --> 00:19:37,368
Then again, I've been pretty
disturbed myself these days.

427
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:41,895
2-1-6. Cleveland.

428
00:19:41,965 --> 00:19:44,246
Maybe Case Western's
offering loan assistance.

429
00:19:50,956 --> 00:19:52,116
This is Kepner.

430
00:19:55,011 --> 00:19:58,295
Oh, yeah? Well, you know
what? I am an awesome surgeon.

431
00:19:58,364 --> 00:20:01,560
And I would've rocked your stupid
little program, so it is your loss.

432
00:20:01,584 --> 00:20:02,849
Go to hell!

433
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,450
Where are you going?

434
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:15,729
Belize.

435
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:17,359
You're going to
have the surgery.

436
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:19,528
Why, so I can get a few more
months of pain and suffering?

437
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:21,663
So you can live, and
then you'll have radiation,

438
00:20:21,687 --> 00:20:23,365
or we'll get you
in a clinical trial.

439
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:26,123
Now you have an opinion, Doctor,

440
00:20:26,192 --> 00:20:28,225
after you've been
MIA for three days?

441
00:20:28,294 --> 00:20:29,571
I've been a little busy, Nick.

442
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:32,563
Look, I get that
this is scary for you.

443
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:34,865
I really do.

444
00:20:36,436 --> 00:20:37,796
But it kind of
sucks for me, too.

445
00:20:38,888 --> 00:20:40,821
They're telling me
I'm riddled with cancer,

446
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:41,930
and I'm completely alone.

447
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:43,052
Where's your sister?

448
00:20:43,076 --> 00:20:44,442
Did you call your sister?

449
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:47,061
You're the one that's
supposed to be here!

450
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:49,763
You're the one who's supposed
to have my back through all this.

451
00:20:49,832 --> 00:20:51,315
And you're nowhere! You're gone!

452
00:20:51,384 --> 00:20:53,184
I have your back! Then have it!

453
00:20:59,475 --> 00:21:01,241
Please?

454
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:04,945
Please have the surgery.

455
00:21:05,014 --> 00:21:08,082
It'll work. And I'll be here.

456
00:21:09,168 --> 00:21:11,836
I'll be here. I promise.

457
00:21:20,596 --> 00:21:22,112
Damn, Phoenix.

458
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:25,532
Things a guy has to
do to get your attention.

459
00:21:31,974 --> 00:21:34,208
I love the fireplace,
the stonework.

460
00:21:34,276 --> 00:21:36,521
You hated it a month ago.

461
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:37,928
And the windows.

462
00:21:37,997 --> 00:21:40,231
These views are
amazing. You are a genius.

463
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:42,193
I will build you a
dream house in Boston.

464
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:44,329
What will we do with
this one? Mark will buy it.

465
00:21:44,353 --> 00:21:46,398
His dreams have
always been my dreams.

466
00:21:48,357 --> 00:21:52,109
Harvard is offering me a
$10 million endowment.

467
00:21:52,178 --> 00:21:55,462
They're setting me up with
an entire research team.

468
00:21:55,531 --> 00:21:58,377
I'm gonna cure Alzheimer's,
Meredith. That's my dream.

469
00:21:58,401 --> 00:21:59,601
Not this house.

470
00:22:03,139 --> 00:22:04,899
You're making this
choice with Cristina.

471
00:22:04,923 --> 00:22:07,243
She's not the only
factor. I'm your husband.

472
00:22:08,194 --> 00:22:10,274
You should make it with me.

473
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:15,627
So I didn't see
any further damage

474
00:22:15,651 --> 00:22:17,328
from the parasite on your scans.

475
00:22:17,352 --> 00:22:18,785
That's great, but you can't just

476
00:22:18,854 --> 00:22:20,354
leave a worm
inside of him forever.

477
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:22,167
This thing has teeth. You
have to get it out of me, please.

478
00:22:22,191 --> 00:22:23,401
I have a worm inside of me, too,

479
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:24,920
but you don't hear
me crying about it.

480
00:22:24,944 --> 00:22:26,187
Yours is in your arm, and
they're taking it out today.

481
00:22:26,211 --> 00:22:27,745
Mine could be anywhere.

482
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:29,947
Oh, my God. My penis.

483
00:22:30,016 --> 00:22:32,160
It's not gonna get to your...
It doesn't do that, does it?

484
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:33,284
My legs.

485
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:34,780
Okay, which is it?
Your legs or your penis?

486
00:22:34,804 --> 00:22:37,471
No, I'm serious. I can't
feel my legs or my arms.

487
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:38,650
It's weird. It's all going numb.

488
00:22:38,674 --> 00:22:39,714
What?

489
00:22:40,543 --> 00:22:41,603
Can you move your toes?

490
00:22:41,627 --> 00:22:42,659
Uh-uh.

491
00:22:42,728 --> 00:22:44,239
No? What about your fingers?

492
00:22:44,263 --> 00:22:45,741
No. Shoot.

493
00:22:45,765 --> 00:22:47,005
Okay.

494
00:22:48,601 --> 00:22:49,812
Can you feel that? Barely.

495
00:22:49,836 --> 00:22:51,852
What's wrong? What's
happening to him?

496
00:22:51,921 --> 00:22:53,921
Page Shepherd.
Right away, Doctor.

497
00:22:58,010 --> 00:22:59,855
Well, the thing's gnawed
through all the discs.

498
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:02,345
C3 to C5 are all inflamed.

499
00:23:02,415 --> 00:23:03,655
So it's in there.

500
00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:07,668
The worm's in his cervical
spine, nesting, waiting.

501
00:23:07,736 --> 00:23:09,236
So there's a
chance of paralysis.

502
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:11,550
Complete paralysis. I
need to get in there quick.

503
00:23:11,574 --> 00:23:13,251
Otherwise, he's gonna
be a quadriplegic.

504
00:23:13,275 --> 00:23:14,987
No. I'm going in with
you. I'm on your six.

505
00:23:15,011 --> 00:23:17,478
I'll get him prepped.
Lock and load, people.

506
00:23:18,847 --> 00:23:19,946
She's on your what?

507
00:23:20,016 --> 00:23:21,256
I have no idea.

508
00:23:23,102 --> 00:23:24,635
Okay, dealer's choice.

509
00:23:24,704 --> 00:23:28,455
Do you want to do the
ventriculoplasty, or resect the tumor,

510
00:23:28,524 --> 00:23:30,674
or...

511
00:23:30,743 --> 00:23:32,510
Do you want to be
primary surgeon?

512
00:23:32,578 --> 00:23:33,878
Fine. Fine?

513
00:23:33,946 --> 00:23:36,546
Okay, what is going on?

514
00:23:36,616 --> 00:23:37,898
Are you staying? Are you going?

515
00:23:37,966 --> 00:23:39,867
'Cause it... It's driving
me crazy. I don't...

516
00:23:42,555 --> 00:23:44,655
If it has to do with
Owen, whatever it is,

517
00:23:44,723 --> 00:23:46,757
I am sure the two
of you can fix it.

518
00:23:51,797 --> 00:23:53,430
I'll take all of it.

519
00:23:53,499 --> 00:23:54,793
What? All of it.

520
00:23:54,817 --> 00:23:56,217
The ventriculoplasty

521
00:23:56,285 --> 00:23:58,280
and as much of the
tumor as you'll let me do.

522
00:23:58,304 --> 00:24:00,424
Thank you. It's very generous.

523
00:24:01,107 --> 00:24:02,347
I'll see you in there.

524
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:05,676
Okay, Marion,

525
00:24:05,744 --> 00:24:08,139
the ultrasound shows the worm
went deeper into your tissue

526
00:24:08,163 --> 00:24:10,409
but we should still be able
to get that nasty thing out.

527
00:24:10,433 --> 00:24:11,915
Jake could die

528
00:24:11,984 --> 00:24:13,928
or he could be in a
wheelchair for the rest of his life.

529
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:16,103
I'm the one that insisted
we go to Thailand.

530
00:24:16,188 --> 00:24:18,188
I keep trying to turn
him into somebody else.

531
00:24:18,257 --> 00:24:21,458
Maybe we made a mistake.

532
00:24:21,527 --> 00:24:24,590
What do you mean exactly?
How do you know it was a mistake?

533
00:24:24,614 --> 00:24:26,980
I don't know why we keep
coming back to each other.

534
00:24:27,049 --> 00:24:30,317
We're the same people, but we
keep expecting a different outcome.

535
00:24:30,386 --> 00:24:31,930
Isn't that the
definition of insanity?

536
00:24:31,954 --> 00:24:35,000
Or love. If there's a
spark, there's a spark.

537
00:24:35,024 --> 00:24:36,351
Or maybe you
think there's a spark,

538
00:24:36,375 --> 00:24:38,186
but it just happened once,
so you can't really tell,

539
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:39,821
and there's no time to
actually figure that out

540
00:24:39,845 --> 00:24:42,205
because you're probably
moving halfway across the country.

541
00:24:45,384 --> 00:24:46,978
Are we gonna get this
worm out any time soon?

542
00:24:47,002 --> 00:24:48,196
Yeah. Get the irrigation ready.

543
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:50,087
On it.

544
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:51,800
C3 and C4 are just a mess.

545
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:53,785
I'm gonna have to go
further in here than I expected.

546
00:24:53,809 --> 00:24:55,387
You might as well
go all the way to C5.

547
00:24:55,411 --> 00:24:57,055
I mean, from the
look of this lesion,

548
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:58,656
that's where the
bastard set up his hive.

549
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,558
I don't want it to be any
more invasive than it has to be.

550
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:02,827
Don't argue with her. She's
starring in her own sci-fi movie.

551
00:25:02,851 --> 00:25:04,162
You mess with
her, she'll pull out

552
00:25:04,186 --> 00:25:05,630
her ray gun and
atomize your ass.

553
00:25:05,654 --> 00:25:07,937
And he's still pouting.
You're a physician.

554
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:10,686
Is this really the first time you
missed a lunch and the crossword

555
00:25:10,743 --> 00:25:12,287
because of a
surgery? Here we go.

556
00:25:12,311 --> 00:25:13,727
It was important to me.

557
00:25:13,796 --> 00:25:14,889
This parasite's important to me.

558
00:25:14,913 --> 00:25:16,141
Yeah, I can see that.

559
00:25:16,165 --> 00:25:18,298
You know what? Fine.
Let's do it right now.

560
00:25:18,367 --> 00:25:20,361
Give me the damn
crossword. Just forget it.

561
00:25:20,385 --> 00:25:24,070
Oh, no. Nobody's ever gonna
forget it. Where is Dr. Warren's bag?

562
00:25:24,139 --> 00:25:25,951
Miranda... MIRANDA:
Oh, there it is.

563
00:25:25,975 --> 00:25:27,902
And this is why you don't
work with your girlfriend.

564
00:25:27,926 --> 00:25:29,037
I warned them.

565
00:25:29,061 --> 00:25:32,101
Here we go. Oh, this
is gonna be so great.

566
00:25:32,164 --> 00:25:36,166
It's way better than a
once-in-a-lifetime bone-eating parasite.

567
00:25:36,234 --> 00:25:37,884
Let's see. One down.

568
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:39,514
Dr. Bailey... Oh, no, no, no.

569
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:42,155
No help from you. I'm too
excited. This is what I live for.

570
00:25:42,224 --> 00:25:45,525
Let's see, "Peruvian
mountain range."

571
00:25:45,611 --> 00:25:47,394
Oh, Andes. Five. Uh-huh...

572
00:25:49,215 --> 00:25:53,216
"Planet with water, four
letters." Oh, Mars. Duh.

573
00:25:54,537 --> 00:25:56,970
Uh... "Fancy sauce"? Fancy...

574
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:58,088
Ooh.

575
00:25:58,157 --> 00:25:59,689
Remoulade. Stop.

576
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:02,142
What? No, no. I'm
on a roll. Come on.

577
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:04,694
Hey, this can't be the Sunday,
'cause this is way too easy.

578
00:26:04,763 --> 00:26:07,998
Oh, hey, this one, 21 across.

579
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:09,566
"My question to you." Hmm.

580
00:26:09,635 --> 00:26:10,929
I'm asking you to put it away.

581
00:26:10,953 --> 00:26:12,552
He's asking you
nicely, Dr. Bailey.

582
00:26:12,638 --> 00:26:14,482
Oh, no, no, no. When
he doesn't get his way,

583
00:26:14,506 --> 00:26:16,990
he holds on to it in his
cheek like a squirrel with a nut.

584
00:26:17,059 --> 00:26:18,742
We are doing the crossword.

585
00:26:18,811 --> 00:26:21,094
What is, "My question to you"?

586
00:26:21,163 --> 00:26:24,364
It's a bunch of letters.
Oh, maybe it's a phrase.

587
00:26:24,433 --> 00:26:25,783
"My question to you," anybody?

588
00:26:25,851 --> 00:26:27,091
How many letters?

589
00:26:27,753 --> 00:26:29,536
Uh... Two, nine, 13.

590
00:26:29,605 --> 00:26:30,982
It's 13 letters? Fourteen.

591
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:32,506
No, I'm looking at it. It's 13.

592
00:26:32,575 --> 00:26:34,074
No, it's 14. Count again.

593
00:26:34,143 --> 00:26:35,542
I just counted.

594
00:26:35,611 --> 00:26:37,122
What, do you have x-ray
vision from across the room?

595
00:26:37,146 --> 00:26:38,478
"Will you marry me?"

596
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:41,081
is my question to you.

597
00:26:41,149 --> 00:26:42,560
And the reason why it's so easy

598
00:26:42,584 --> 00:26:44,479
is because I made the crossword.

599
00:26:44,503 --> 00:26:45,853
Took me two damn months

600
00:26:45,921 --> 00:26:47,382
not to mention getting a mockup
made of <i>The New York Times.</i>

601
00:26:47,406 --> 00:26:49,106
The phrase has 14 letters.

602
00:26:49,175 --> 00:26:55,028
"Will," four, "you," seven,
"marry," 12, "me," 14.

603
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:58,032
Got it.

604
00:27:01,153 --> 00:27:02,393
It was in C4.

605
00:27:13,598 --> 00:27:15,309
All right, temp's
down to 30 degrees.

606
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:16,853
<i>Cross-clamping the aorta.</i>

607
00:27:19,572 --> 00:27:20,572
<i>All right.</i>

608
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:22,039
Let's see what
we're working with.

609
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:26,821
Damn it. This
wasn't in the scans.

610
00:27:26,845 --> 00:27:29,374
The tumor's infiltrated much
deeper into the ventricle.

611
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:32,315
<i>Reconstructive
ventriculoplasty isn't gonna cut it.</i>

612
00:27:33,218 --> 00:27:35,118
We could do a Fontan?

613
00:27:35,187 --> 00:27:37,621
Directly sew the right atrium
to the pulmonary artery.

614
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:38,917
We could patch whatever's left.

615
00:27:38,941 --> 00:27:40,618
That would help with blood flow,

616
00:27:40,642 --> 00:27:42,353
but the hole in the
resection would...

617
00:27:42,377 --> 00:27:44,828
Yeah. He'd arrest
right on the table.

618
00:27:47,333 --> 00:27:48,726
We could do an
RV to a PA conduit...

619
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:51,990
No, the thing would
calcify. It would kill him.

620
00:27:52,621 --> 00:27:55,155
<i>A cadaver homograft?</i>

621
00:27:55,224 --> 00:27:56,684
<i>The hole would be way too big.</i>

622
00:27:56,708 --> 00:27:58,542
<i>It's instant heart failure.</i>

623
00:27:58,611 --> 00:28:01,628
They don't know what to
do, Callie. They have no idea.

624
00:28:01,696 --> 00:28:04,860
No, it's Altman and Yang,
okay? They'll figure something out.

625
00:28:04,884 --> 00:28:06,324
They're gonna
figure something out.

626
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:09,636
Come on, guys. Come on.

627
00:28:35,364 --> 00:28:37,030
Hey.

628
00:28:37,733 --> 00:28:38,898
Sedona.

629
00:28:40,002 --> 00:28:41,434
How's my ticker?

630
00:28:43,506 --> 00:28:45,005
Cancer free?

631
00:28:49,411 --> 00:28:52,212
The tumor had
taken over your heart,

632
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:54,597
and there was no
good way to get it out,

633
00:28:55,384 --> 00:28:56,900
so they had to close up.

634
00:28:57,703 --> 00:28:59,236
But I thought...

635
00:29:01,256 --> 00:29:03,190
You said it was my best shot.

636
00:29:04,793 --> 00:29:05,926
It was.

637
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:07,114
So...

638
00:29:09,381 --> 00:29:11,662
I guess I'm going to Belize.

639
00:29:13,719 --> 00:29:14,719
Yeah.

640
00:29:22,694 --> 00:29:23,727
Stupid.

641
00:29:27,233 --> 00:29:28,799
I'm so freaking...

642
00:29:30,836 --> 00:29:33,316
Why didn't I come sooner?

643
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:35,372
Why didn't I come...

644
00:29:37,976 --> 00:29:39,056
Oh, my God.

645
00:29:40,078 --> 00:29:41,778
I'm so stupid.

646
00:29:43,215 --> 00:29:44,881
I'm so stupid.

647
00:29:46,268 --> 00:29:47,767
I'm so stupid.

648
00:29:47,836 --> 00:29:49,319
No. No.

649
00:29:52,407 --> 00:29:55,542
I'm so stupid. I'm so stupid.

650
00:30:14,329 --> 00:30:15,362
Hey. Hey.

651
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:18,882
I think we're gonna lose Yang.

652
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:24,320
Owen, what happened?
Please tell me.

653
00:30:24,389 --> 00:30:27,825
'Cause I have tried everything
short of offering her my own job.

654
00:30:27,893 --> 00:30:30,027
I mean, I've sang,
I've danced, I've...

655
00:30:30,095 --> 00:30:32,535
I slept with someone else.

656
00:30:39,037 --> 00:30:41,504
So,

657
00:30:41,573 --> 00:30:44,733
there's nothing that
you could've done.

658
00:30:46,945 --> 00:30:49,012
She's not leaving you.

659
00:30:53,135 --> 00:30:54,701
She's leaving me.

660
00:30:57,622 --> 00:30:58,705
I'm sorry.

661
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:17,941
Hopkins didn't pull
the offer, did they?

662
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:22,779
They gave me the international
rotation and the moving expenses,

663
00:31:22,847 --> 00:31:25,549
and they took
care of all my loans.

664
00:31:25,617 --> 00:31:26,666
College, med school.

665
00:31:26,735 --> 00:31:27,900
Yes.

666
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:30,804
They're even throwing
in a mortgage allowance.

667
00:31:30,873 --> 00:31:32,288
I could buy a house.

668
00:31:32,357 --> 00:31:34,223
Good.

669
00:31:34,292 --> 00:31:36,359
They gave me
everything I asked for.

670
00:31:38,063 --> 00:31:39,913
So did Hunt.

671
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:43,883
Then why the hell
aren't you celebrating?

672
00:31:51,126 --> 00:31:53,560
No one's ever
wanted me like this.

673
00:31:57,316 --> 00:31:59,449
You just don't recognize
the view, Karev.

674
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:05,021
The crowd going wild,
people taking pictures,

675
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:07,157
the snap of the
tape as you break it.

676
00:32:08,109 --> 00:32:09,609
What are you talking about?

677
00:32:10,862 --> 00:32:13,863
What it looks like
when you finish first.

678
00:32:37,255 --> 00:32:38,638
Chief, you paged?

679
00:32:40,542 --> 00:32:41,641
Yeah.

680
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:53,069
I can't hire you
next year, Kepner.

681
00:32:56,074 --> 00:32:57,424
I...

682
00:32:57,492 --> 00:33:00,510
I'm taking my boards again.
You know, I'll pass this time.

683
00:33:00,579 --> 00:33:01,756
You don't have to
worry about that.

684
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:03,300
It's not just about the boards.

685
00:33:03,349 --> 00:33:05,443
I've had to do some last-minute
rejiggering of my budget,

686
00:33:05,467 --> 00:33:07,985
and I just don't have the money.

687
00:33:08,053 --> 00:33:10,298
This is a top-ranking hospital.
There's always money.

688
00:33:10,322 --> 00:33:13,690
I can help you find it. I'm
really good with budgets.

689
00:33:18,379 --> 00:33:19,846
Chief,

690
00:33:20,549 --> 00:33:23,583
I have nothing left.

691
00:33:23,652 --> 00:33:26,085
Seattle Grace
was my last option.

692
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:34,895
You're not the best
candidate for the job anymore.

693
00:33:37,999 --> 00:33:39,349
I am sorry.

694
00:33:43,555 --> 00:33:45,833
They're conjoined at the
sternum and the diaphragm.

695
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:46,956
It's tricky.

696
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:50,250
I can handle it.

697
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:56,532
So Seattle's still in the
mix. That's a surprise.

698
00:33:57,135 --> 00:33:58,185
Because of Owen?

699
00:34:00,855 --> 00:34:05,158
Cristina, he should be with
someone who wants a baby.

700
00:34:05,226 --> 00:34:08,227
And you should be with
someone who wants you.

701
00:34:08,297 --> 00:34:12,799
You know what? You and
everyone else needs to just...

702
00:34:13,935 --> 00:34:15,251
Shut up about it.

703
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,920
It's a huge decision.

704
00:34:16,988 --> 00:34:18,733
And I don't want you
doing the wrong thing.

705
00:34:18,757 --> 00:34:20,877
It is not your decision to make.

706
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:23,676
I am your person.

707
00:34:23,745 --> 00:34:26,065
We're not married.
You're not my...

708
00:34:32,871 --> 00:34:33,911
He's my person.

709
00:34:46,585 --> 00:34:49,580
Hey. I just checked in on
him. His vitals are stable.

710
00:34:49,604 --> 00:34:50,715
He's sleeping.

711
00:34:50,739 --> 00:34:51,955
Don't ever leave.

712
00:34:52,024 --> 00:34:53,289
What?

713
00:34:53,358 --> 00:34:55,558
Don't ever leave.

714
00:34:56,461 --> 00:34:58,261
Promise me that right now.

715
00:34:59,932 --> 00:35:01,443
I'm not going
anywhere. I promise.

716
00:35:01,467 --> 00:35:06,869
After my brother, I thought,
I can't do this ever again.

717
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:09,439
I won't do this again.

718
00:35:10,175 --> 00:35:12,208
And now, here I am.

719
00:35:12,277 --> 00:35:15,978
Okay, whatever you
can't do, I will. I'm here.

720
00:35:16,047 --> 00:35:18,309
And that's how this works, okay?

721
00:35:18,333 --> 00:35:19,565
Come here.

722
00:35:45,894 --> 00:35:47,134
So, what's it gonna be?

723
00:35:47,779 --> 00:35:49,312
Columbia, Stanford?

724
00:35:49,381 --> 00:35:51,631
I hear that Mayo
is back in the mix.

725
00:36:00,526 --> 00:36:04,227
You know, really, you can't
go wrong with any of them, so...

726
00:36:17,576 --> 00:36:18,875
What are you doing?

727
00:36:49,307 --> 00:36:50,589
Propose to me again.

728
00:36:55,146 --> 00:36:56,786
Baby, you should sit down.

729
00:36:58,683 --> 00:37:01,717
Propose to me again.

730
00:37:04,789 --> 00:37:07,757
Wow. I mean, you look...

731
00:37:09,094 --> 00:37:11,094
Wow.

732
00:37:11,162 --> 00:37:12,773
Miranda, I would love
nothing more than that,

733
00:37:12,797 --> 00:37:14,058
but I'm telling
you, you should...

734
00:37:14,082 --> 00:37:16,060
For the love of
God, man, I'm sorry

735
00:37:16,084 --> 00:37:19,418
I messed up your
proposal, but...

736
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:22,788
I'm wearing a thong, and
this is as sorry as I get.

737
00:37:22,857 --> 00:37:24,518
So, come on. Ask
me to marry you.

738
00:37:24,542 --> 00:37:26,709
Okay, look, there was
the shooting, right?

739
00:37:26,778 --> 00:37:28,178
And then you and I broke up,

740
00:37:28,212 --> 00:37:31,281
and I just, I wanted
to get out of here,

741
00:37:31,349 --> 00:37:34,500
to do something different,
something inspiring.

742
00:37:34,569 --> 00:37:36,736
I just

743
00:37:36,805 --> 00:37:39,122
didn't think it would
actually happen.

744
00:37:39,974 --> 00:37:41,874
I got a call,

745
00:37:41,943 --> 00:37:45,611
and I've been accepted
as a surgical intern at UCLA.

746
00:37:47,482 --> 00:37:49,082
An intern, Miranda.

747
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:54,470
I'll be working seven days
a week, 1,000 miles away.

748
00:37:58,392 --> 00:37:59,892
Everything's different now.

749
00:38:19,431 --> 00:38:20,963
What?

750
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,616
I'm happy.

751
00:38:23,684 --> 00:38:27,186
I know this
doesn't fix anything.

752
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:31,741
But I'm just happy.

753
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:36,680
I'm leaving.

754
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,900
You got that? Is it
too heavy for you?

755
00:38:57,969 --> 00:39:00,637
No, I'm fine, but thank you.

756
00:39:00,705 --> 00:39:01,971
No, thank you.

757
00:39:03,775 --> 00:39:05,436
You son of a bitch. I
had to hear it from Hunt?

758
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:07,571
What, you couldn't even be
man enough to tell me yourself?

759
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:08,823
Sweetie. She's had a
horrible day. I'm so...

760
00:39:08,847 --> 00:39:10,780
You ungrateful crap dog!

761
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:12,860
It's Hopkins. You went there.
You of all people should know.

762
00:39:12,884 --> 00:39:14,684
You are a miserable,
miserable bastard.

763
00:39:14,753 --> 00:39:17,913
Robbins, they want me. All
right? They really want me.

764
00:39:18,306 --> 00:39:20,073
Oh, well, you...

765
00:39:20,942 --> 00:39:22,575
You're actually going?

766
00:39:22,644 --> 00:39:24,087
Can we talk about
this when I get back?

767
00:39:24,111 --> 00:39:25,311
No!

768
00:39:25,397 --> 00:39:26,507
What are you doing?

769
00:39:26,531 --> 00:39:27,742
No, you are not going to Boise,

770
00:39:27,766 --> 00:39:29,226
because you no longer
represent this hospital!

771
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:30,649
Give me a break...

772
00:39:30,718 --> 00:39:33,469
Look at Alex, showing us
all up by going to Hopkins.

773
00:39:33,538 --> 00:39:35,649
If Robbins lets
him live that long.

774
00:39:35,673 --> 00:39:37,451
Fine. You know what?
Forget the charts!

775
00:39:37,475 --> 00:39:39,053
Go see if they need
help in the clinic.

776
00:39:39,077 --> 00:39:40,159
I'm going to Boston.

777
00:39:40,912 --> 00:39:42,278
I told Hunt.

778
00:39:42,347 --> 00:39:44,358
I've been prepping for
this surgery for days!

779
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:45,748
I'm going to Mayo.

780
00:39:45,817 --> 00:39:48,184
This is crap!

781
00:39:48,253 --> 00:39:50,653
<i>I don't know how
those birds do it.</i>

782
00:39:52,707 --> 00:39:56,342
<i>Travel thousands of
miles without getting lost,</i>

783
00:39:56,410 --> 00:40:00,429
<i>banging into windows,
being eaten by cats...</i>

784
00:40:00,498 --> 00:40:02,298
All right, let's get you
some water, okay?

785
00:40:02,367 --> 00:40:03,911
Let's get you some water.

786
00:40:03,935 --> 00:40:07,295
You know, I'm so sick of
everyone being so damn nice to me.

787
00:40:27,492 --> 00:40:29,058
You just feel guilty...

788
00:40:29,127 --> 00:40:30,471
April... for having
sex with me...

789
00:40:30,495 --> 00:40:32,106
No, come on. That is
not... and then I failed...

790
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:34,208
I am messed up right now.
And now no one wants me.

791
00:40:34,232 --> 00:40:35,465
What?

792
00:40:36,901 --> 00:40:38,384
Oh, crap. Even Seattle?

793
00:40:38,453 --> 00:40:40,893
I don't want your pity, okay?
Can you just leave me alone?

794
00:40:40,922 --> 00:40:43,383
Can you do that? I'm
fine. I'm fine! Okay.

795
00:40:43,407 --> 00:40:45,169
I'm gonna be fine,
Jackson... All right.

796
00:40:45,193 --> 00:40:46,409
I'm gonna...

797
00:40:46,478 --> 00:40:47,610
April, April...

798
00:40:48,730 --> 00:40:50,129
Come...

799
00:40:53,367 --> 00:40:57,302
<i>but every spring,
they're always here.</i>

800
00:40:57,371 --> 00:40:59,906
<i>I guess they come
back to what they know.</i>

801
00:41:13,121 --> 00:41:16,856
<i>People say it's pretty
cool watching them go.</i>

802
00:41:21,996 --> 00:41:26,065
<i>They say you can
actually see the moment</i>

803
00:41:26,133 --> 00:41:28,734
<i>when, at some mysterious signal,</i>

804
00:41:31,239 --> 00:41:32,805
<i>all at once,</i>

805
00:41:36,461 --> 00:41:38,494
<i>the birds decide to leave.</i>

806
00:41:57,532 --> 00:41:59,372
<i>So maybe I've been missing out.</i>

807
00:42:07,809 --> 00:42:09,158
<i>Whatever.</i>

808
00:42:11,796 --> 00:42:14,163
<i>There's always next year.</i>
