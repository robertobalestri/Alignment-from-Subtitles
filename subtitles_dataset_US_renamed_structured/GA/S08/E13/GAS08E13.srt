1
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:05,632
<i>The baby you have is the
baby you were destined to have.</i>

2
00:00:05,656 --> 00:00:07,255
What you thinkin', huh?

3
00:00:07,324 --> 00:00:08,390
<i>It was meant to be.</i>

4
00:00:08,459 --> 00:00:09,658
You gettin' tired?

5
00:00:09,727 --> 00:00:11,671
<i>That's what all the
adoption people tell you.</i>

6
00:00:11,695 --> 00:00:14,929
<i>Anyway, I like
to think it's true.</i>

7
00:00:14,998 --> 00:00:17,810
<i>But everything else in the world
seems so completely random.</i>

8
00:00:17,834 --> 00:00:19,401
You gonna talk now, too?

9
00:00:21,538 --> 00:00:25,757
<i>What if one little
thing I said or did...</i>

10
00:00:25,826 --> 00:00:27,893
<i>Could have made
it all fall apart?</i>

11
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:37,001
<i>What if I'd chosen
another life for myself.</i>

12
00:00:38,505 --> 00:00:40,172
<i>Or another person?</i>

13
00:00:45,412 --> 00:00:48,012
<i>We might have never
found each other.</i>

14
00:00:53,853 --> 00:00:56,455
<i>What if I had been
raised differently?</i>

15
00:00:56,523 --> 00:00:59,124
<i>What if my mother
had never been sick?</i>

16
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,361
<i>What if I'd actually
had a good father?</i>

17
00:01:05,699 --> 00:01:06,932
<i>What if?</i>

18
00:01:09,669 --> 00:01:10,936
<i>What if?</i>

19
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:15,306
<i>What if?</i>

20
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:16,641
Meredith.

21
00:01:23,117 --> 00:01:24,383
Meredith.

22
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:26,619
Meredith.

23
00:01:26,686 --> 00:01:28,370
Good morning, Mom.

24
00:01:28,438 --> 00:01:31,022
Morning. Are you riding
with me or with your father?

25
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:33,425
Because if you're riding with
me, we have to leave now.

26
00:01:33,494 --> 00:01:35,454
Don't wait. I'll go with Dad.

27
00:01:35,478 --> 00:01:37,106
Who's coming with
me? Hiya, darling.

28
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:38,396
Hi.

29
00:01:38,466 --> 00:01:40,565
Don't be late, either of
you. Sets a bad example.

30
00:01:53,747 --> 00:01:55,667
I'm telling you...

31
00:01:56,249 --> 00:01:58,049
It's true.

32
00:02:08,912 --> 00:02:10,632
Oh, thank you so
much. You're welcome.

33
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:12,397
Okay.

34
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:14,132
All right.

35
00:02:14,201 --> 00:02:15,600
I need you to sit right here

36
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:17,402
and wait until Mommy
comes out, okay?

37
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:19,871
Don't move. Here.
Play with your thingy.

38
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,660
And, I'm gonna just
be in the next room...

39
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:22,752
No, Mommy!

40
00:02:22,776 --> 00:02:24,176
Yes. Sit right there.

41
00:02:24,244 --> 00:02:25,410
Hey, pumpkin.

42
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:26,479
Hi, Daddy.

43
00:02:26,546 --> 00:02:28,396
Hey, hey. Really?

44
00:02:28,465 --> 00:02:31,015
Really? I mean, you couldn't
figure out anything else?

45
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:33,095
Well, Owen, if she's gonna
schedule staff meetings

46
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:34,664
before the day care opens,
what do you expect me to do?

47
00:02:34,688 --> 00:02:37,033
I know, I know. Chief's here.

48
00:02:37,057 --> 00:02:38,457
Okay, bye, guys.

49
00:02:43,797 --> 00:02:46,047
I've been looking at
Seattle Pres's numbers,

50
00:02:46,116 --> 00:02:49,251
and I think we can absorb
them the way we did Mercy West.

51
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:51,063
I want reports on
where your departments

52
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:53,287
can use extra residents
and equipment.

53
00:02:53,356 --> 00:02:56,924
Congratulations on your
third Harper Avery Award.

54
00:03:00,247 --> 00:03:01,663
Portal vein reconstruction,

55
00:03:01,732 --> 00:03:03,810
pretty soon they're gonna
rename the Whipple the Grey.

56
00:03:03,834 --> 00:03:05,350
Thank you.

57
00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:07,902
Well, there's some
press here today, FYI.

58
00:03:07,972 --> 00:03:09,182
Okay, let's go. Trauma?

59
00:03:09,206 --> 00:03:11,073
Abdominal closure on an MVC,

60
00:03:11,141 --> 00:03:12,707
and we will wait to
see what comes in.

61
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:13,791
Neuro?

62
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,243
I have a laminectomy.

63
00:03:15,312 --> 00:03:17,107
Just one? You got a golf game?

64
00:03:17,131 --> 00:03:18,691
You know what,
people? I keep saying it.

65
00:03:18,715 --> 00:03:21,182
If you're not innovating,
be generating.

66
00:03:21,251 --> 00:03:22,417
Cardio?

67
00:03:22,486 --> 00:03:25,636
Yang is doing a solo
thoracic aortic aneurysm,

68
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:27,465
oh, and also, I'll be
checking in on my kid

69
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:30,659
with the artificial lung who
is waiting for a transplant.

70
00:03:30,727 --> 00:03:32,822
Yeah, can I just say for the
record that he's my patient,

71
00:03:32,846 --> 00:03:34,791
and I don't agree with
this method of treatment?

72
00:03:34,815 --> 00:03:36,993
The FDA has not approved
an artificial lung on children.

73
00:03:37,017 --> 00:03:39,434
Well, I got emergency approval.
It buys the kid more time,

74
00:03:39,503 --> 00:03:41,247
it keeps him from being
sedated and ventilated,

75
00:03:41,271 --> 00:03:42,399
I think it's worth exploring.

76
00:03:42,423 --> 00:03:44,063
He should be sedated.
Let his body heal.

77
00:03:44,124 --> 00:03:46,068
This is just too
risky. It's innovative.

78
00:03:46,092 --> 00:03:48,938
Shepherd, this is what I'm
talking about. Let's hope it works.

79
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:50,645
Good work, Torres.

80
00:03:50,714 --> 00:03:52,864
General, Dr. Bailey?

81
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:54,599
Uh, yes. Extended Whipple.

82
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:56,579
Speak up. I'm doing
an extended Whipple.

83
00:03:57,688 --> 00:03:59,804
Owen. I got it.

84
00:03:59,873 --> 00:04:01,306
Dr. Bailey, go on.

85
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:03,074
Um, 47-year-old male,

86
00:04:03,143 --> 00:04:06,844
advanced pancreatic cancer
with invasion of the portal vein.

87
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:08,991
Well, what are you using
to graft the portal vein?

88
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:10,549
The...

89
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:13,334
Um, the jugular. I'll take that.

90
00:04:13,403 --> 00:04:14,681
Excuse me? I'll
take your Whipple.

91
00:04:14,705 --> 00:04:16,038
Send me the chart ASAP.

92
00:04:16,724 --> 00:04:18,006
Okay. Well, I...

93
00:04:18,075 --> 00:04:19,607
Neonatal?

94
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:22,394
A pyloric stenosis.
Actually, two pylorics and...

95
00:04:22,463 --> 00:04:25,246
That's not a reflection
on you, Bailey.

96
00:04:25,315 --> 00:04:26,815
She probably wants a surgery

97
00:04:26,884 --> 00:04:29,684
to take her mind off of
all the Harper Avery fuss.

98
00:04:30,904 --> 00:04:33,264
Now don't take it the wrong way.

99
00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:35,207
I'm not.

100
00:04:35,792 --> 00:04:36,975
Good.

101
00:04:37,044 --> 00:04:38,459
Thank you so much.

102
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:42,096
Oh, my God!

103
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,067
When? Last night.

104
00:04:45,135 --> 00:04:49,020
I mean, I kind of thought he
would, and then, sure enough.

105
00:04:49,089 --> 00:04:51,200
Are you okay, April?
'Cause I know...

106
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:53,002
I mean, I knew this was
gonna be hard for you, but...

107
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:54,425
Oh.

108
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:57,062
You are going to
find someone, April.

109
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,041
And Charles is really into you.

110
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:01,032
Ugh! I know, I know,
but Charles is...

111
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,367
Hi.

112
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:04,870
Hey, April. Charles is what?

113
00:05:04,938 --> 00:05:05,938
Nothing.

114
00:05:07,107 --> 00:05:09,024
No, no, no.

115
00:05:09,093 --> 00:05:11,493
I am thrilled. Have
you told anyone else?

116
00:05:11,562 --> 00:05:14,046
Besides my parents,
no. You're my person.

117
00:05:14,114 --> 00:05:16,798
Oh, God, this is so beautiful.

118
00:05:16,866 --> 00:05:18,878
You guys, you're gonna
be, like, the next Shepherds.

119
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:20,513
Screw that. We're gonna
be the next Webbers.

120
00:05:20,537 --> 00:05:22,015
Okay, how did he do
it? Tell me everything.

121
00:05:22,039 --> 00:05:25,039
Okay, so last night, we
went out to dinner, and he...

122
00:05:32,466 --> 00:05:33,898
Good morning.

123
00:05:33,967 --> 00:05:35,734
Are you talking to me?

124
00:05:35,803 --> 00:05:38,123
Jackson, don't feed the animals.

125
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:43,119
Every single one of
you can suck my...

126
00:05:43,143 --> 00:05:46,428
Hey! How's everybody
doing this morning?

127
00:05:46,496 --> 00:05:48,696
Everybody ready
to kick some butt?

128
00:05:50,867 --> 00:05:52,787
Let's run the
board, guys. Avery?

129
00:05:52,836 --> 00:05:54,085
Covering the pit.

130
00:05:54,153 --> 00:05:55,987
Noble work. Yang?

131
00:05:56,056 --> 00:05:57,789
Solo thoracic aortic aneurysm.

132
00:05:57,858 --> 00:05:58,990
Huh.

133
00:05:59,059 --> 00:06:01,419
Well, I guess that means
I'm doing Torres' post-ops.

134
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:02,994
Kepner?

135
00:06:03,063 --> 00:06:04,962
Uh, I'm on Shepherd's
service. Good Shepherd.

136
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,731
Hey. I'm on bad Shepherd.

137
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,567
Maybe we're gonna
be the next Shepherds.

138
00:06:09,636 --> 00:06:11,102
No, we aren't.

139
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:13,283
All right, guys. The day
is as good as you make it.

140
00:06:13,307 --> 00:06:14,850
All right, let's get out there

141
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:17,103
and keep Seattle Grace
the country's best hospital.

142
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:18,693
Come on!

143
00:06:18,761 --> 00:06:20,562
Yang, smile. Yeesh.

144
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,796
All right. Let's move.

145
00:06:21,865 --> 00:06:24,082
Uh, can I speak with
you, Dr. Webber?

146
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:33,708
Okay, okay, okay.

147
00:06:33,777 --> 00:06:35,960
I thought we had a rule
about this in the hospital.

148
00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:37,278
Oh, I'm sorry.

149
00:06:37,347 --> 00:06:40,081
I just... My God. You're
so hot in that ring.

150
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:41,816
I do look good, don't I?

151
00:06:41,885 --> 00:06:43,930
Yeah. Hey, what did
your parents think?

152
00:06:43,954 --> 00:06:45,364
I mean, what did your mom say?

153
00:06:45,388 --> 00:06:48,540
Well, she loved it, of
course. And she adores you.

154
00:06:48,609 --> 00:06:50,736
Well, finally. It took a while.

155
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,111
Well, you were a jerk
before you met me.

156
00:06:54,548 --> 00:06:56,428
She didn't know there
was a good guy in there.

157
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:58,282
But I did.

158
00:06:59,285 --> 00:07:00,852
Oh, I love it.

159
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:02,186
And I love you.

160
00:07:09,546 --> 00:07:11,946
Have a great day.

161
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:14,682
Okay, come on, guys
and Allegra. Let's go.

162
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,987
He's so good with the
kids. How's he doing?

163
00:07:20,056 --> 00:07:21,889
He's better.

164
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:23,425
Yeah. I think we're past it.

165
00:07:23,493 --> 00:07:24,804
Really? Yeah.

166
00:07:24,828 --> 00:07:26,645
That's great. Mmm-hmm.

167
00:07:26,713 --> 00:07:29,314
I know. I've just
heard it can be...

168
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:31,316
A hard road, coming back.

169
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:33,563
I mean, who knows what
he went through over there.

170
00:07:33,587 --> 00:07:36,337
Yeah, well... He doesn't
like to talk to me about it.

171
00:07:36,406 --> 00:07:37,967
But he does skype with
some of his old buddies

172
00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:39,673
that are still in Iraq, and,

173
00:07:39,742 --> 00:07:42,744
this guy, Teddy, seems to
be helping him through it.

174
00:07:42,812 --> 00:07:46,213
And he hasn't had another
episode since that one.

175
00:07:46,983 --> 00:07:49,083
So anyway, he's good.

176
00:07:49,152 --> 00:07:50,752
He's good. We're good now.

177
00:07:50,821 --> 00:07:53,688
I don't know how you do it.
And then with the kids, too?

178
00:07:53,757 --> 00:07:56,574
Well... You'll find out
soon enough, right?

179
00:07:58,528 --> 00:08:00,562
Besides, you and
Derek will be fine.

180
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:02,397
You two are perfect.

181
00:08:08,555 --> 00:08:10,555
All Ellis is saying
is that she wants

182
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:13,103
you to use your full potential.

183
00:08:13,777 --> 00:08:15,297
Oh. Hi, honey. Hi.

184
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:18,497
Like that clinical trial
you used to talk about.

185
00:08:18,565 --> 00:08:19,909
I'm about to have
a child, Richard.

186
00:08:19,933 --> 00:08:21,210
I don't have time
for a clinical trial.

187
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:23,100
I think you should find it.

188
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:25,153
I think it'll do you good.

189
00:08:30,527 --> 00:08:31,877
Good morning.

190
00:08:31,945 --> 00:08:33,044
Mmm.

191
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:38,849
A clinical trial...

192
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:41,318
This elevator is not working.

193
00:08:42,955 --> 00:08:44,389
What an ass.

194
00:08:46,793 --> 00:08:48,894
We brought you a
cokehead found in an alley.

195
00:08:48,962 --> 00:08:51,930
Presumed overdose.
Tried Narcan. No response.

196
00:08:51,999 --> 00:08:54,532
Had to shock her
once in the field at 300.

197
00:08:54,601 --> 00:08:56,434
BP is 80 over 60.

198
00:08:56,503 --> 00:08:58,936
SAT's 96 on 100%.

199
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:01,639
All right. On my count.

200
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,319
One...

201
00:09:03,343 --> 00:09:05,760
Stop. V-fib. Charge
the paddles to 300.

202
00:09:06,863 --> 00:09:07,962
Clear!

203
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,199
There we go.

204
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:12,445
Ready? On my count.

205
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:14,185
One, two, three.

206
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:18,033
Avery, she's all yours.

207
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:19,218
All right, let's
get a tox screen,

208
00:09:19,242 --> 00:09:22,009
an EKG, a CBC, a
CMP and an X-ray now.

209
00:09:22,078 --> 00:09:23,812
Right away, Doctor.

210
00:09:37,144 --> 00:09:38,688
Well, it's a stroke
of luck, actually.

211
00:09:38,712 --> 00:09:40,177
I'm doing a surgery today,

212
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:43,214
and I'm planning to use
the new Grey technique.

213
00:09:43,282 --> 00:09:45,010
So rather than a
boring press interview,

214
00:09:45,034 --> 00:09:46,763
why don't you come
on up to the gallery,

215
00:09:46,787 --> 00:09:48,747
take a few shots of
the technique in action...

216
00:09:48,771 --> 00:09:50,704
And, we'll talk after?

217
00:09:50,773 --> 00:09:51,884
I'll see you in the OR.

218
00:09:51,908 --> 00:09:53,185
Great. Sounds good. Thank you.

219
00:09:53,209 --> 00:09:54,889
- All right.
- Okay, thanks.

220
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:57,711
That was brilliant.

221
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:00,197
Why settle for another
boring press release, right?

222
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,633
So can I scrub in?

223
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:03,781
I would love to see the
procedure done firsthand.

224
00:10:03,819 --> 00:10:05,786
Why? Your focus is cardio.

225
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:07,433
You're not gonna
get a cardio fellowship

226
00:10:07,457 --> 00:10:09,307
scrubbing in on your
mother's Whipple.

227
00:10:09,376 --> 00:10:10,642
That's true.

228
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:14,929
Cristina Yang is doing a
solo aortic aneurysm today.

229
00:10:14,997 --> 00:10:17,109
That came in last night,
and had I been here...

230
00:10:17,133 --> 00:10:18,249
Yeah, but you weren't

231
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:19,795
because you were too
busy getting engaged.

232
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:22,654
So, now that that's over,
what do you want to do?

233
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:24,456
Do you want to do
an aortic aneurysm?

234
00:10:24,524 --> 00:10:25,890
Yes.

235
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:27,670
Do you want me to ask
Dr. Torres to give it to you?

236
00:10:27,694 --> 00:10:30,761
No, Mother. I can get it myself.

237
00:10:31,365 --> 00:10:32,365
There you go.

238
00:10:36,253 --> 00:10:38,136
Dr. Bailey.

239
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:41,183
I am stoked for our Whipple
today. Are you stoked?

240
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:42,907
We, um...

241
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:44,575
No, we're not...

242
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,344
You gotta speak up.

243
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:48,390
We're not doing a Whipple today.

244
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:49,881
I had it taken from me.

245
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:51,716
Mandy. No.

246
00:10:51,785 --> 00:10:53,167
Please don't call me Mandy.

247
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:54,402
We talked about this.

248
00:10:54,471 --> 00:10:56,538
You can't let people
walk all over you.

249
00:10:56,606 --> 00:10:57,784
You gotta stand up for yourself.

250
00:10:57,808 --> 00:10:59,688
Not if it's Ellis Grey, I don't.

251
00:11:00,377 --> 00:11:01,926
Ellis is operating?

252
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:03,544
Come on.

253
00:11:03,613 --> 00:11:07,181
The next best thing to operating
is watching Ellis Grey do it.

254
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,350
We gotta get in on
that surgery, Mandy.

255
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:10,434
Remember what we say?

256
00:11:11,387 --> 00:11:12,670
I don't remember what we say.

257
00:11:12,739 --> 00:11:14,105
We create...

258
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:15,867
Oh. We create our own destiny.

259
00:11:15,891 --> 00:11:17,792
Our own destiny.
That's right. Come on.

260
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,100
Chop, chop.

261
00:11:26,402 --> 00:11:27,435
Hi there.

262
00:11:27,503 --> 00:11:28,970
Oh, God.

263
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:31,472
What now?

264
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:34,559
Well, you OD'ed, your heart
stopped, but you're stable.

265
00:11:35,562 --> 00:11:36,744
Can I get a name, please?

266
00:11:36,813 --> 00:11:38,346
So you can call the cops?

267
00:11:38,415 --> 00:11:40,130
I just need anything really,

268
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:42,010
so we don't mix up your
pee with somebody else's.

269
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:43,568
You have my pee?

270
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:45,414
Yeah. You were kinda
giving it away for a while there.

271
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:47,605
Spectacular.

272
00:11:49,476 --> 00:11:50,508
Name?

273
00:11:50,577 --> 00:11:52,810
Lucille. Okay.

274
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,111
Ball.

275
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:57,615
You're a funny lady.

276
00:11:57,683 --> 00:12:00,484
Well, that's how
I make my living.

277
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,020
All right, Miss Ball.

278
00:12:02,088 --> 00:12:05,390
We are gonna get you worked
up and send you on your way.

279
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,542
Hey, where am I?

280
00:12:08,611 --> 00:12:09,844
Seattle Grace Hospital.

281
00:12:13,283 --> 00:12:14,632
Oh, God.

282
00:12:16,752 --> 00:12:20,287
Don't push. Theresa, don't push.

283
00:12:20,357 --> 00:12:21,622
Kepner, what's happening?

284
00:12:21,691 --> 00:12:23,735
She's dilated and effaced.
The baby started crowning

285
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:24,870
and then just stopped.

286
00:12:24,894 --> 00:12:26,134
Okay, move.

287
00:12:28,014 --> 00:12:30,148
Theresa, you're doing great.

288
00:12:33,954 --> 00:12:36,470
Okay, Kepner, order
up a 3D ultrasound, stat,

289
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:39,652
and prep an OR for a crash
C-section. And page my husband.

290
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:40,916
Right away.

291
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:44,812
What happened?

292
00:12:44,881 --> 00:12:46,876
He detached the connector
to the artificial lung,

293
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,177
and I had to clamp off the
cannula to stop the bleeding.

294
00:12:48,201 --> 00:12:49,779
I told you this was a bad idea.

295
00:12:49,803 --> 00:12:51,446
All right. Let's book an OR.
Let's get it hooked back up.

296
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,315
No, it's too dangerous. He
has to go back on ECMO.

297
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:54,817
It's not working, so he's worse?

298
00:12:54,841 --> 00:12:56,407
Hold on. Everybody, stop.

299
00:12:56,476 --> 00:12:57,976
Look at the Sat.

300
00:12:58,044 --> 00:13:01,846
93? He's never been above
79. His respiratory rate's good.

301
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:04,259
Riley, is it hard for
you to breathe at all?

302
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:05,466
No, I can breathe.

303
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:07,501
Okay, hold on.

304
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:08,987
Blow in this, okay?

305
00:13:10,723 --> 00:13:12,306
Oh! Wow!

306
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:13,591
What's happening?

307
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:15,071
He's breathing better
than he should be.

308
00:13:15,095 --> 00:13:16,777
He's breathing better
than he ever has.

309
00:13:16,846 --> 00:13:18,524
So he can use it until
he gets the transplant?

310
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:20,242
We need to run
more tests, but...

311
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:22,317
From the sound of his lungs,

312
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:25,603
it's possible he may not
even need a transplant.

313
00:13:25,672 --> 00:13:27,182
Are you serious? Well,
you know, we have to...

314
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:28,684
Are you serious? We
have to see the tests, but...

315
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:31,225
Oh, thank you! I
love you! I love you!

316
00:13:31,294 --> 00:13:32,410
I think I do, too.

317
00:13:37,433 --> 00:13:38,549
Okay.

318
00:13:39,001 --> 00:13:40,368
Wait. What?

319
00:13:40,437 --> 00:13:42,803
But why? Why can't
you do the surgery?

320
00:13:42,872 --> 00:13:45,873
Uh, the Chief of
Surgery, Ellis Grey,

321
00:13:45,941 --> 00:13:47,992
will be doing it.

322
00:13:49,044 --> 00:13:51,879
I mean, I can. I
would. She just...

323
00:13:51,947 --> 00:13:55,016
There's protocols, and she...

324
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,996
Think of it as a huge upgrade.

325
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:58,886
You just got handed
the keys to a Jaguar

326
00:13:58,955 --> 00:14:01,389
and you've been
driving, like, a Civic.

327
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:04,842
A good car. A solid,
dependable car. But Dr. Grey...

328
00:14:04,911 --> 00:14:06,494
Hello, Alex.

329
00:14:06,563 --> 00:14:08,913
Mr. Taylor, Mrs.
Taylor, I'm Dr. Grey.

330
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:11,794
I'll be doing your
pancreaticoduodenectomy today.

331
00:14:11,818 --> 00:14:15,003
I'll graft with a section
of your internal iliac vein,

332
00:14:15,071 --> 00:14:16,570
a new technique of my invention.

333
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,239
By forgoing the
use of the jugular,

334
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:20,274
you'll have no visible
scarring on the neck.

335
00:14:20,343 --> 00:14:21,743
Oh. Well, that's nice...

336
00:14:21,811 --> 00:14:23,873
I'll gladly have you sign
these consent forms.

337
00:14:23,897 --> 00:14:26,175
It's a pleasure to meet you.
I'll see you after we're done.

338
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:27,981
Jaguar. Doc... Dr. Grey.

339
00:14:29,102 --> 00:14:30,768
Any chance I could
scrub in with you?

340
00:14:30,837 --> 00:14:33,118
Alex, of course.
Love to have you.

341
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:37,542
See? You have to
speak up for yourself.

342
00:14:40,363 --> 00:14:42,508
Can you explain anything
that woman just said?

343
00:14:42,532 --> 00:14:45,749
You know, I, uh... Excuse me.

344
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:49,787
Here you go, sir.

345
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,000
Your heart stopped again.

346
00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:57,889
Because of all the
cocaine you've enjoyed,

347
00:14:57,913 --> 00:14:59,358
you're going to need
a surgical implant,

348
00:14:59,382 --> 00:15:01,382
an AICD pacemaker.

349
00:15:01,451 --> 00:15:03,762
If you have any questions
about this procedure,

350
00:15:03,786 --> 00:15:05,719
here's an informative brochure.

351
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:10,658
She's a ray of sunshine.

352
00:15:10,727 --> 00:15:12,860
She is.

353
00:15:12,929 --> 00:15:15,107
I'm gonna go out on
a limb and assume

354
00:15:15,131 --> 00:15:16,642
that you don't
have any insurance.

355
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:19,194
So is there somebody maybe
I can call, parents, somebody?

356
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:21,619
No. Parents are dead.

357
00:15:21,688 --> 00:15:24,132
I'm sorry to hear that. Is it
from disease, family history?

358
00:15:24,156 --> 00:15:27,158
My mother died of a stomach
thing. My father killed himself.

359
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:30,268
I am really sorry.

360
00:15:32,915 --> 00:15:34,982
What's funny?

361
00:15:35,051 --> 00:15:37,985
I do have a sister.
She's a half sister.

362
00:15:38,054 --> 00:15:39,987
Okay. Nearby?

363
00:15:42,241 --> 00:15:43,441
Very.

364
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:45,343
She's a doctor...

365
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:46,810
At this hospital.

366
00:15:49,098 --> 00:15:51,164
What, are you kidding?

367
00:15:51,233 --> 00:15:53,183
Who? Who? Who is she?

368
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:56,053
Hey, we've never met.
She doesn't know me.

369
00:15:56,656 --> 00:15:58,388
And trust me,

370
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:00,257
she doesn't want to.

371
00:16:03,997 --> 00:16:05,129
You paged?

372
00:16:05,197 --> 00:16:07,357
Yeah, have a look
at her ultrasound.

373
00:16:09,401 --> 00:16:11,602
That is a massive tumor.

374
00:16:11,671 --> 00:16:13,688
What? Percy, shut up.

375
00:16:13,756 --> 00:16:15,834
It's pressing up against the
neck. Is the airway secured?

376
00:16:15,858 --> 00:16:18,069
I did an exit and trached her.
It's as secure as it can be for now.

377
00:16:18,093 --> 00:16:19,555
Why can't I see my
baby? What's wrong?

378
00:16:19,579 --> 00:16:21,523
Theresa, your baby has a tumor.

379
00:16:21,547 --> 00:16:24,259
But Dr. Shepherd's here. He's
gonna take good care of her.

380
00:16:24,283 --> 00:16:26,161
The Shepherds are the
best you and your baby

381
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:27,345
could hope for, okay?

382
00:16:27,369 --> 00:16:29,086
They are an amazing team.

383
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:30,188
All right.

384
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:33,907
Wait. What's wrong with her?

385
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:44,546
What took you so long?

386
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:46,404
I wasn't standing around, Derek.

387
00:16:46,472 --> 00:16:48,133
I had to make sure that the
mother wouldn't bleed out.

388
00:16:48,157 --> 00:16:49,835
If we wait any longer, she
won't even be a mother.

389
00:16:49,859 --> 00:16:51,275
It's pressing
against the trachea.

390
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:52,822
I need to make sure
the airway's secure.

391
00:16:52,846 --> 00:16:54,212
The bleeders can't wait.

392
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,025
You have to work on
the neck as I operate.

393
00:16:56,049 --> 00:16:57,109
It's gonna take us all day.

394
00:16:57,133 --> 00:16:58,477
I'm sorry. I know
you weren't planning

395
00:16:58,501 --> 00:16:59,941
on spending the
day with your wife.

396
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,852
I'll see you in there.

397
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:05,023
It's a beautiful
day to save lives.

398
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:06,991
Nice.

399
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:11,673
Oh, hey, darlin'. Hey.

400
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:13,231
What's up?

401
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:15,699
I have to steal a surgery
from Cristina Yang.

402
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:17,301
Well...

403
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,581
Yang's always
stealing surgeries.

404
00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:21,683
That girl gives me the creeps.

405
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:22,956
I know. It's just...

406
00:17:23,025 --> 00:17:24,392
Mom's operating today,

407
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,610
and I thought it would
be nice to go in and see it,

408
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:28,812
but she doesn't
want me in there, so...

409
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:31,349
Remember when you were
learning how to ride a bike

410
00:17:31,418 --> 00:17:34,552
and you ran into the back of
the Richmonds' station wagon?

411
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,070
Vividly.

412
00:17:36,139 --> 00:17:37,379
What happened after that?

413
00:17:37,439 --> 00:17:41,175
I sat on the curb and
cried and bled all over you.

414
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,160
Well, after that?

415
00:17:43,212 --> 00:17:44,645
You made me get back on my bike.

416
00:17:44,713 --> 00:17:45,713
No.

417
00:17:45,781 --> 00:17:49,033
Your mother made
you get back on,

418
00:17:49,102 --> 00:17:51,502
and you learned to ride a bike.

419
00:17:52,772 --> 00:17:54,716
She just wants you to succeed.

420
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,474
I know.

421
00:17:56,543 --> 00:17:59,021
I'm doing a
proctocolectomy right now.

422
00:17:59,045 --> 00:18:00,805
You want in? Single incision?

423
00:18:02,482 --> 00:18:03,981
I probably shouldn't.

424
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:05,482
Yeah. Probably not.

425
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:24,719
How many aortic aneurysms
has she actually done?

426
00:18:24,787 --> 00:18:26,754
Two, in the hospital.

427
00:18:26,823 --> 00:18:28,901
She's probably done
more at home on cats.

428
00:18:30,126 --> 00:18:32,006
Hey, does she eat
with anyone, ever?

429
00:18:32,061 --> 00:18:33,644
No.

430
00:18:33,713 --> 00:18:35,391
That's what happens to you
when you screw an attending.

431
00:18:35,415 --> 00:18:37,298
You're a pariah.

432
00:18:37,367 --> 00:18:38,794
Unlike your approach of just
never having sex with anybody?

433
00:18:38,818 --> 00:18:40,718
No virgin jokes. Thank you.

434
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:42,286
Her and Preston Burke.

435
00:18:42,355 --> 00:18:43,420
Really?

436
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:45,100
And apparently, it
was so scary for him,

437
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,674
he actually had
to leave the state.

438
00:18:46,743 --> 00:18:49,710
I always say, never
mess with the crazy chicks.

439
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:51,840
She's probably gonna
go full-on Izzie one day

440
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:53,897
and shoot up the hospital.

441
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:56,033
What's Izzie?

442
00:18:56,101 --> 00:18:57,618
Oh, it means crazy.

443
00:18:57,687 --> 00:19:02,006
She was a girl in our class
who was sleeping with a patient.

444
00:19:02,075 --> 00:19:03,953
And then she stole a
transplant heart for him.

445
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:05,425
What?

446
00:19:05,494 --> 00:19:07,772
Until Meredith turned her
into her mom and got her fired.

447
00:19:07,796 --> 00:19:09,813
Oh, my God, Mer.
You're so brave.

448
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:12,027
Hold on a second. How many
people washed out your year?

449
00:19:12,051 --> 00:19:14,385
Two. Her and O'Malley.

450
00:19:14,454 --> 00:19:16,403
007.

451
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:19,773
He failed his intern exam
and was never seen again.

452
00:19:20,743 --> 00:19:22,677
Okay. Here I go.

453
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:23,945
Where are you going?

454
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:25,900
To get back on my bicycle. Oh!

455
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:32,069
Dr. Grey is gonna graft an
iliac vein to the portal vein,

456
00:19:32,137 --> 00:19:36,307
but that man's got bilateral
deep vein thrombosis

457
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:39,221
in his femorals, and the
iliacs won't be usable.

458
00:19:39,245 --> 00:19:41,678
I mean, she's gonna
look first, right?

459
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:43,530
Who's that woman
with Dr. Robbins?

460
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:45,577
I don't know. Some
ortho surgeon.

461
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:47,101
Oh.

462
00:19:47,169 --> 00:19:49,503
I should've gone into
ortho. I liked ortho.

463
00:19:49,571 --> 00:19:50,838
Why didn't you?

464
00:19:50,906 --> 00:19:53,641
Well, when Ellis Grey
says you're good for cardio...

465
00:19:55,077 --> 00:19:56,877
Excuse me, Dr. Torres.

466
00:19:56,946 --> 00:19:59,814
I was wondering if I could
do the aortic aneurysm today.

467
00:19:59,882 --> 00:20:02,415
This will be Yang's third,
and I've only done one.

468
00:20:02,484 --> 00:20:03,784
So it's only fair...

469
00:20:03,853 --> 00:20:05,631
Webber, I know how
many you've done.

470
00:20:05,655 --> 00:20:08,288
And I know what my
residents need, okay?

471
00:20:08,357 --> 00:20:10,874
My mother suggested
that I ask you.

472
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:17,397
Why don't you split it? You
and Yang can do it together.

473
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:18,732
Thank you.

474
00:20:20,569 --> 00:20:21,613
Whatever Ellis Grey wants.

475
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:22,703
You know it.

476
00:20:22,772 --> 00:20:24,455
Yang's not gonna like it.

477
00:20:24,507 --> 00:20:26,467
Well, it's better than
kicking her off the case.

478
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,259
Bitch scares me.

479
00:20:32,965 --> 00:20:34,076
Lucy.

480
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,994
You got some 'splaining to do.

481
00:20:36,018 --> 00:20:38,519
I'm just gonna go.

482
00:20:38,588 --> 00:20:40,582
No, you're not,

483
00:20:40,606 --> 00:20:43,668
because if you don't get this
procedure, you're going to die.

484
00:20:43,692 --> 00:20:47,127
Look, I get it. I
know. It is scary.

485
00:20:47,196 --> 00:20:49,274
But I can tell you everything
that's gonna happen.

486
00:20:49,298 --> 00:20:50,798
Yeah, I already
read the brochure.

487
00:20:50,867 --> 00:20:52,116
Okay.

488
00:20:52,185 --> 00:20:53,629
The automatic implanted
cardioverter defibrillator

489
00:20:53,653 --> 00:20:55,613
is placed beneath the
skin below the collarbone.

490
00:20:55,655 --> 00:20:57,149
The electrode wires... Wow.

491
00:20:57,173 --> 00:20:58,789
Yeah, I have a
photographic memory.

492
00:20:58,858 --> 00:21:02,298
Yeah. Okay. Well, you
should go to med school.

493
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:04,745
Right. Or I could
be a ballerina.

494
00:21:06,149 --> 00:21:07,848
I'm serious.

495
00:21:07,917 --> 00:21:11,752
Okay? You should see all
of this as a second chance.

496
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:14,482
People turn things around
all the time. You're smart.

497
00:21:14,506 --> 00:21:16,285
You're sharp. You're beautiful.

498
00:21:16,309 --> 00:21:19,142
You got a sister here
you've never even met.

499
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:21,476
You could have a
whole new family.

500
00:21:23,332 --> 00:21:25,412
Let's start by fixing
your heart, okay?

501
00:21:31,139 --> 00:21:32,840
Oh, okay.

502
00:21:33,642 --> 00:21:35,459
All right.

503
00:21:35,527 --> 00:21:37,647
It's gonna be okay.

504
00:21:50,576 --> 00:21:53,677
What the hell is Meredith Webber
doing on my aortic aneurysm?

505
00:21:59,352 --> 00:22:00,418
Uh...

506
00:22:07,626 --> 00:22:11,395
Listen, if you tell Meredith
or Ellis or anyone...

507
00:22:11,464 --> 00:22:14,492
That surgery is mine. You can't
just throw your girlfriend on it.

508
00:22:14,516 --> 00:22:15,983
I swear, Yang.

509
00:22:16,052 --> 00:22:17,796
I will fix it so you never see
the inside of an OR again.

510
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:19,153
I will bury you.

511
00:22:19,222 --> 00:22:21,867
I'm not sharing my surgery.
Change the board and get her off.

512
00:22:21,891 --> 00:22:23,758
Look, I didn't change
the board. Torres did.

513
00:22:24,761 --> 00:22:27,544
Where's Torres then?

514
00:22:27,613 --> 00:22:30,392
CSF is leaking. Let's get
some suction in here, Percy.

515
00:22:30,416 --> 00:22:32,260
I need you to have lunch
with the president of the board

516
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:33,462
of the Bryson school tomorrow.

517
00:22:33,486 --> 00:22:35,030
Why are you talking
about this now?

518
00:22:35,054 --> 00:22:36,637
Because, Derek,
you're never home.

519
00:22:36,705 --> 00:22:38,900
You're always spending
the night in that stupid trailer

520
00:22:38,924 --> 00:22:40,524
on that stupid piece of land,

521
00:22:40,593 --> 00:22:43,560
planning that stupid house
that you're never gonna build.

522
00:22:45,498 --> 00:22:47,064
Pulse ox is dropping.
What did you do?

523
00:22:47,132 --> 00:22:48,860
I didn't do anything. It's
invading the tracheal wall. Clamp.

524
00:22:48,884 --> 00:22:50,111
Secure the airway.
We're losing her.

525
00:22:50,135 --> 00:22:51,769
I'm working as
hard as I can, Derek.

526
00:22:51,821 --> 00:22:53,621
You just pay attention
to what you're doing.

527
00:23:06,285 --> 00:23:07,328
Do me a favor.

528
00:23:07,352 --> 00:23:08,352
I'm going into surgery.

529
00:23:08,421 --> 00:23:10,570
Yeah, just, tell Dr. Grey that

530
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,706
the patient has
a history of DVT.

531
00:23:12,792 --> 00:23:16,277
And that the iliac veins may
not be suitable for grafting.

532
00:23:16,345 --> 00:23:18,562
Wait. Wait. What? Why
didn't you say something?

533
00:23:18,631 --> 00:23:20,642
Just... You're going
in there. Just tell her.

534
00:23:20,666 --> 00:23:22,032
You tell her. He's your patient.

535
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,540
I'm not gonna tell
her she's wrong.

536
00:23:25,371 --> 00:23:27,771
I mean, she took the
chart. She read it, right?

537
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,923
Yes. She knows what she's doing.

538
00:23:31,026 --> 00:23:32,525
Well, just tell her.

539
00:23:34,864 --> 00:23:36,346
Yang, wait.

540
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:38,360
When in the hell are you
gonna give Lucille Ball her AICD?

541
00:23:38,384 --> 00:23:39,762
You have to do
it. I've got surgery.

542
00:23:39,786 --> 00:23:40,996
I don't think so.
You did the consult.

543
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,464
Where's your wife? What?

544
00:23:42,488 --> 00:23:44,182
She was supposed to put a
pacemaker in our OD girl hours ago,

545
00:23:44,206 --> 00:23:45,501
and now she's trying
to pawn it off on me.

546
00:23:45,525 --> 00:23:46,640
Hey. I have a surgery.

547
00:23:46,709 --> 00:23:48,391
You're the cardio
consult. You do it.

548
00:23:48,461 --> 00:23:49,604
Avery can do it.

549
00:23:49,628 --> 00:23:51,628
I can't spare Avery.

550
00:23:51,697 --> 00:23:53,475
I'm not giving up this surgery
to stick a pacemaker in a junkie.

551
00:23:53,499 --> 00:23:54,810
Tell your wife to have
Meredith Webber...

552
00:23:54,834 --> 00:23:56,299
Yang, just back off!

553
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:22,125
I'm sorry. I just...

554
00:24:22,194 --> 00:24:23,944
I just got really...

555
00:24:26,015 --> 00:24:28,398
Well, you won't need stitches.

556
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:29,800
This time.

557
00:24:31,204 --> 00:24:32,815
I thought it was supposed
to be getting better.

558
00:24:32,839 --> 00:24:34,032
Or are you gonna
hit another intern?

559
00:24:34,056 --> 00:24:35,088
No.

560
00:24:37,393 --> 00:24:38,470
Why do you keep helping me?

561
00:24:38,494 --> 00:24:40,894
Why don't you just report me?

562
00:24:46,051 --> 00:24:47,885
Because I'm a doctor.

563
00:24:50,505 --> 00:24:52,539
Please don't tell my wife.

564
00:24:55,444 --> 00:24:58,145
Well, you can finish the
rest of this. I have surgery.

565
00:25:05,321 --> 00:25:06,853
Suction here.

566
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:09,656
So June sounds good. Have
you thought about where?

567
00:25:09,725 --> 00:25:12,888
Oh. Meredith and I
thought about Hawaii.

568
00:25:12,912 --> 00:25:14,211
That might be cool.

569
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,824
You know, have
everyone come out and...

570
00:25:15,848 --> 00:25:17,748
Really, a destination wedding?

571
00:25:17,817 --> 00:25:19,916
Alex, I'm running a hospital.

572
00:25:19,985 --> 00:25:21,702
I can't just dash off to...

573
00:25:21,771 --> 00:25:23,921
Retract that, please. Clamp.

574
00:25:23,989 --> 00:25:26,073
You'll do it here. I'll
book the Rainier Club.

575
00:25:26,142 --> 00:25:27,474
It's gorgeous.

576
00:25:27,543 --> 00:25:29,703
That sounds great.

577
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:31,895
What the hell am I looking at?

578
00:25:31,964 --> 00:25:35,165
The iliac veins are
completely thrombosed,

579
00:25:35,234 --> 00:25:38,135
both of them. Unusable.
Completely unusable.

580
00:25:40,206 --> 00:25:41,206
Did you know about this?

581
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,540
No.

582
00:25:44,727 --> 00:25:47,077
Okay. Change of plans.

583
00:25:47,146 --> 00:25:48,628
We'll use the renal vein.

584
00:25:48,697 --> 00:25:50,297
Damn it.

585
00:25:50,383 --> 00:25:52,732
Someone page Dr. Bailey, please.

586
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:54,634
I want her in here now.

587
00:25:57,589 --> 00:25:58,867
Why aren't you doing a TEVAR?

588
00:25:58,891 --> 00:26:00,624
I'm doing a direct
approach. It's cooler.

589
00:26:00,692 --> 00:26:02,403
A TEVAR is safer.
It's far less invasive.

590
00:26:02,427 --> 00:26:04,673
You go in through the femoral,
you don't have to crack the chest.

591
00:26:04,697 --> 00:26:06,212
I already ordered the graft.

592
00:26:06,281 --> 00:26:08,659
You two might have worked
out your surgical plan before this.

593
00:26:08,683 --> 00:26:12,118
I did, and my surgical plan
didn't include this nimrod.

594
00:26:12,187 --> 00:26:15,016
No, it just included hacking
up the patient like a psychopath.

595
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,985
Girls, don't make me come
over there and do it myself.

596
00:26:17,009 --> 00:26:18,341
Shut up and work.

597
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:19,487
10 blade. 10 blade.

598
00:26:19,511 --> 00:26:21,194
Avery.

599
00:26:21,263 --> 00:26:22,679
Where have you been?

600
00:26:22,748 --> 00:26:25,181
I'm booking an OR.

601
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,945
I'm gonna take my... That
girl up for her pacemaker.

602
00:26:26,969 --> 00:26:28,001
Why?

603
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:29,581
Somebody made off
with an armload of drugs

604
00:26:29,605 --> 00:26:32,255
from the dispensary,
codeine, morphine, Demerol.

605
00:26:32,324 --> 00:26:33,523
Okay, why...

606
00:26:33,593 --> 00:26:36,087
'Cause the dispensary was
accessed with your ID card.

607
00:26:36,111 --> 00:26:37,677
That's why.

608
00:26:37,746 --> 00:26:39,062
Damn it.

609
00:26:45,737 --> 00:26:47,837
But you knew the
patient had thrombosis?

610
00:26:47,906 --> 00:26:48,955
I...

611
00:26:49,724 --> 00:26:50,804
I had... I did.

612
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:52,292
Speak up.

613
00:26:52,361 --> 00:26:54,345
In the legs... Yes.

614
00:26:54,413 --> 00:26:55,929
Did you look at his chart?

615
00:26:56,015 --> 00:26:57,948
Of course I looked at his chart.

616
00:26:58,017 --> 00:26:59,727
But there was no indication
that the thrombosis was this bad.

617
00:26:59,751 --> 00:27:01,218
Why wasn't it in his chart?

618
00:27:01,287 --> 00:27:05,822
Because I had chosen
to use the jugular.

619
00:27:05,891 --> 00:27:07,490
They were in the
medical records.

620
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:09,243
And you didn't tell me

621
00:27:09,311 --> 00:27:11,762
because I'd opted to
not cut the man's throat?

622
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:13,491
Well, that's...
It's a good plan...

623
00:27:13,515 --> 00:27:15,193
But I ended up cutting
his throat anyway.

624
00:27:15,217 --> 00:27:16,816
My procedure's a wash,

625
00:27:16,886 --> 00:27:18,796
and the patient's been under
far longer than is optimal.

626
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:22,773
That's why I picked the jugular.

627
00:27:22,841 --> 00:27:25,142
Is that right, Dr. Bailey?

628
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:26,450
Is that why you picked it?

629
00:27:28,414 --> 00:27:29,530
Alex, where's my graft?

630
00:27:29,598 --> 00:27:30,718
Here's the graft.

631
00:27:32,801 --> 00:27:34,501
I'm just suturing.

632
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:35,769
Whoa!

633
00:27:36,338 --> 00:27:37,504
Oh, my God.

634
00:27:38,974 --> 00:27:41,608
I might have nicked the carotid.

635
00:27:41,677 --> 00:27:43,437
You people are
trying to kill me.

636
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,466
Did you get the whole tumor?

637
00:27:49,535 --> 00:27:50,578
I told you.

638
00:27:50,602 --> 00:27:52,136
I'm not asking for myself.

639
00:27:52,204 --> 00:27:54,437
I'm asking what I
should tell the mother...

640
00:27:54,507 --> 00:27:56,874
Just go. I will
talk to her myself.

641
00:27:58,443 --> 00:27:59,620
So we'll talk about
the preschool...

642
00:27:59,644 --> 00:28:01,056
It's gonna be late.
I'm gonna stay

643
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,407
and look into
this clinical trial.

644
00:28:02,431 --> 00:28:03,730
That's great.

645
00:28:03,799 --> 00:28:06,283
One more reason for you
to stay out of the house.

646
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:10,687
That's fine.

647
00:28:10,756 --> 00:28:12,767
It's fine. Maybe you'll be more
interested once the baby comes.

648
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:14,541
Right.

649
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:15,887
Everything's gonna be
different when the baby comes.

650
00:28:15,911 --> 00:28:17,272
Well, a girl can hope.
Nothing's gonna change.

651
00:28:17,296 --> 00:28:18,506
What do you think
is gonna change?

652
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:19,758
Do you even want a
baby? I didn't say that.

653
00:28:19,782 --> 00:28:21,259
I'm not talking...
Yes, I want a baby.

654
00:28:21,283 --> 00:28:23,984
No, I'm not talking about
a baby. This baby, with me.

655
00:28:27,356 --> 00:28:28,922
Do you love me?

656
00:28:33,562 --> 00:28:34,562
Do you?

657
00:28:36,298 --> 00:28:38,031
Of course I love you.

658
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:40,400
Can you say it without
looking at the floor?

659
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:57,151
Less than three minutes
of circulatory arrest left.

660
00:28:57,219 --> 00:28:58,930
You go over that, and
the organs start dying.

661
00:28:58,954 --> 00:29:00,314
If Webber hadn't
taken so long...

662
00:29:00,339 --> 00:29:02,099
I took the time it
needed. Two minutes.

663
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:04,157
- Done. Go back on bypass.
- Yes, Doctor.

664
00:29:04,943 --> 00:29:06,254
Oh. Got a leak.
Okay, I'll find it.

665
00:29:06,278 --> 00:29:08,090
I'll throw a stitch.
No, it's too risky.

666
00:29:08,114 --> 00:29:09,608
The leak is behind the heart.
You need to do an internal graft.

667
00:29:09,632 --> 00:29:11,381
Will you shut
up? I will find it.

668
00:29:11,449 --> 00:29:12,633
Dr. Torres?

669
00:29:13,903 --> 00:29:15,786
Webber's right, Yang.

670
00:29:15,854 --> 00:29:17,181
Her way is safer. Let her do it.

671
00:29:17,205 --> 00:29:18,445
5-0 prolene.

672
00:29:19,592 --> 00:29:21,291
Move your hands.

673
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,826
Move your hands, please.

674
00:29:29,585 --> 00:29:31,429
What are you doing?
Move your hands.

675
00:29:31,453 --> 00:29:32,573
I got it. I found the leak.

676
00:29:32,621 --> 00:29:35,255
Give me a clamp.
2-0 prolene. I got it.

677
00:29:39,661 --> 00:29:41,261
Have you seen my wife?

678
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:44,531
As a matter of fact, I have.
She just threatened to quit.

679
00:29:44,599 --> 00:29:46,811
Do me a favor. Wash your
laundry at home, not in my OR.

680
00:29:46,835 --> 00:29:48,768
Well, there's two
sides to every story...

681
00:29:48,837 --> 00:29:50,581
Yeah, I'm not
interested in your side.

682
00:29:50,605 --> 00:29:52,417
Derek, Richard and I had
very high hopes for you,

683
00:29:52,441 --> 00:29:54,219
but you have been nothing
but a disappointment.

684
00:29:54,243 --> 00:29:56,905
You don't publish, you don't
teach, your attitude is terrible.

685
00:29:56,929 --> 00:29:59,974
The residents have a nickname
for you, and it is not flattering.

686
00:29:59,998 --> 00:30:01,909
What do they call
me? Get it together.

687
00:30:01,933 --> 00:30:03,878
Because if it comes down to
a choice between you and her,

688
00:30:03,902 --> 00:30:06,822
you need to be very clear
which one of you I will choose.

689
00:30:12,845 --> 00:30:15,896
Trust me, you two don't
want to be the next Shepherds.

690
00:30:15,965 --> 00:30:17,397
So I start to do the repair...

691
00:30:17,466 --> 00:30:19,293
And she just stuck
her hand in? Yes!

692
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:20,361
Wait. What happened?

693
00:30:20,385 --> 00:30:21,425
Yang's a freakin' maniac.

694
00:30:21,453 --> 00:30:23,053
She's dangerous.

695
00:30:25,623 --> 00:30:27,057
My patient's fine.

696
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:29,810
Awake, great vitals,
if you were interested.

697
00:30:29,878 --> 00:30:32,362
Well, that's great
'cause OD girl bolted.

698
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:35,399
You had no business
shoving in there.

699
00:30:35,467 --> 00:30:36,950
You had no business in that OR.

700
00:30:37,019 --> 00:30:38,451
I wasn't about
to let that guy die

701
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,248
watching you jack around
with the internal graft.

702
00:30:40,272 --> 00:30:42,050
That was the right technique.

703
00:30:42,074 --> 00:30:43,773
Dr. Torres specifically...

704
00:30:43,843 --> 00:30:45,987
Dr. Torres only sided with you
because you're the Chief's little girl.

705
00:30:46,011 --> 00:30:48,661
She's a pathetic lackey.

706
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:51,681
Well, we'd all be working under
Dr. Preston Burke right now,

707
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:55,201
but you screwed us out
of that opportunity, literally.

708
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,837
What exactly did you do to him?

709
00:30:56,905 --> 00:30:59,823
Because he left the
state to get away from you.

710
00:30:59,891 --> 00:31:01,458
Good one.

711
00:31:01,527 --> 00:31:03,471
If you want to get personal,
why don't you ask prince charming

712
00:31:03,495 --> 00:31:05,540
what he and the virgin
Mary like to do in his office?

713
00:31:05,564 --> 00:31:07,884
What? What are
you talking about?

714
00:31:10,119 --> 00:31:11,951
What...

715
00:31:12,037 --> 00:31:13,347
She's a lunatic. What
is she talking about?

716
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:16,857
You can't believe a word she
says. She's just... Come on!

717
00:31:16,925 --> 00:31:18,124
April?

718
00:31:19,778 --> 00:31:22,345
I'm sorry. I'm...
I'm sorry. I...

719
00:31:23,866 --> 00:31:25,265
Oh, God.

720
00:31:25,334 --> 00:31:26,699
Just shoot me now.

721
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,586
Oh, God.

722
00:31:35,877 --> 00:31:38,512
Tests are good. SATs are
great. He's breathing unassisted.

723
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:40,025
He's gonna be home
by the end of the week.

724
00:31:40,049 --> 00:31:41,476
And he's been taken
off the transplant list?

725
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,733
Yep, yep. Two weeks
on your little thing,

726
00:31:43,802 --> 00:31:45,402
and his lungs are
actually improved.

727
00:31:47,372 --> 00:31:48,822
Well, good work.

728
00:31:48,908 --> 00:31:51,825
Oh, amazing work. And
I didn't even want to do it.

729
00:31:51,894 --> 00:31:54,761
It was amazing. You're amazing.

730
00:31:57,182 --> 00:32:01,518
Well, um, we should
celebrate, sometime.

731
00:32:01,587 --> 00:32:03,147
Yeah, we should. We
should go get drinks.

732
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:05,405
I mean, this is... This
is one to celebrate.

733
00:32:05,473 --> 00:32:06,534
Dr. Torres, here are your kids.

734
00:32:06,558 --> 00:32:07,558
Yeah.

735
00:32:07,609 --> 00:32:08,625
Mommy.

736
00:32:08,693 --> 00:32:10,494
Hi, baby girl.

737
00:32:10,562 --> 00:32:12,545
Hi. Okay.

738
00:32:12,614 --> 00:32:14,981
Well... Sometime.

739
00:32:15,050 --> 00:32:16,099
Yeah. Yeah.

740
00:32:16,168 --> 00:32:17,617
Yeah, sometime.

741
00:32:17,686 --> 00:32:19,452
All right. Here we go.

742
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:28,578
Slow down, and tell me.

743
00:32:32,651 --> 00:32:34,217
I can't.

744
00:32:34,286 --> 00:32:36,453
I mean, I can't believe them.

745
00:32:36,522 --> 00:32:39,155
I cannot believe them!

746
00:32:41,727 --> 00:32:42,727
I heard what happened.

747
00:32:44,813 --> 00:32:46,379
You did? Yes.

748
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:49,065
And you should be upset.

749
00:32:49,134 --> 00:32:50,945
You should be
humiliated. Ellis...

750
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:52,535
You don't let Yang,

751
00:32:52,604 --> 00:32:55,154
you don't let anyone
show you up in your OR.

752
00:32:55,224 --> 00:32:56,489
Understand? Ever.

753
00:32:59,027 --> 00:33:02,412
I shouldn't have been in
there. I wasn't prepared.

754
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,380
Then why in the
world did you go in?

755
00:33:04,449 --> 00:33:06,867
Because you pushed me.

756
00:33:06,935 --> 00:33:08,702
And you aren't mad

757
00:33:08,771 --> 00:33:11,738
because I embarrassed myself.

758
00:33:11,824 --> 00:33:14,224
You're mad because
I embarrassed you.

759
00:33:21,115 --> 00:33:22,560
Ellis, what in the
hell is wrong with...

760
00:33:22,584 --> 00:33:24,934
I want you to fire Mandy Bailey.

761
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:27,103
Tonight, Richard. I
want you to do it tonight.

762
00:33:27,172 --> 00:33:28,450
What are you talking
about? What is this about?

763
00:33:28,474 --> 00:33:30,106
She made a complete fool of me.

764
00:33:30,175 --> 00:33:32,242
I had no idea, no idea at all.

765
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:34,978
I looked like a total failure.

766
00:33:35,046 --> 00:33:37,914
Okay, look... Now
look, just hold on.

767
00:33:38,584 --> 00:33:39,983
Now just...

768
00:33:40,051 --> 00:33:41,651
Just breathe.

769
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,754
I was humiliated.

770
00:33:43,822 --> 00:33:45,054
Okay.

771
00:33:45,123 --> 00:33:47,457
In front of all those people.

772
00:33:47,526 --> 00:33:50,660
I was just trying to
fix her stupid mistake.

773
00:33:50,729 --> 00:33:51,769
I know.

774
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:53,530
I looked like a fraud.

775
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:57,000
But you know you're
not. You know that.

776
00:33:57,068 --> 00:33:59,269
Like an idiot.

777
00:33:59,337 --> 00:34:01,037
There was nothing to graft.

778
00:34:01,106 --> 00:34:03,607
Okay, look, okay,
but you made it work.

779
00:34:03,675 --> 00:34:06,109
You always do.
The patient is fine.

780
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:12,199
Look, you can't
control everything.

781
00:34:12,267 --> 00:34:15,302
I know you want to.
But you can't, okay?

782
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,406
Is Meredith all right?

783
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:23,035
I don't know how to talk to
her, Richard. Will you talk to her?

784
00:34:23,062 --> 00:34:25,728
Yeah, I will, I will.
She'll be all right.

785
00:34:25,797 --> 00:34:29,132
I am horrible at
it. I am terrible.

786
00:34:29,201 --> 00:34:32,051
I just want her to do well. I just
want her to do the best she can...

787
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:36,022
I know. I know you do.
And she'll be okay, okay?

788
00:34:36,091 --> 00:34:37,724
I promise. Okay?

789
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,243
Thank you.

790
00:34:47,385 --> 00:34:49,636
Okay. Okay.

791
00:34:51,873 --> 00:34:53,556
Yang. Hey.

792
00:34:56,194 --> 00:34:58,361
Thanks... For today.

793
00:35:01,716 --> 00:35:04,083
Tell your wife
and get some help.

794
00:35:04,152 --> 00:35:07,137
She'll leave, and I'll
lose my kids. She...

795
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:09,889
She's...

796
00:35:11,492 --> 00:35:13,292
She's afraid I'm
gonna hurt one of them.

797
00:35:14,162 --> 00:35:15,461
Aren't you?

798
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:17,247
Hey. Hey.

799
00:35:17,316 --> 00:35:18,548
Hey. How are ya?

800
00:35:18,617 --> 00:35:19,727
Okay. Oh, my gosh.

801
00:35:19,751 --> 00:35:20,812
What happened to your hand?

802
00:35:20,836 --> 00:35:22,535
Oh, I...

803
00:35:22,604 --> 00:35:24,887
I... Some junkie
patient knocked me

804
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:27,057
into a tray of
instruments, so...

805
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:28,720
Oh, you poor baby. All
right. Let's get you home,

806
00:35:28,744 --> 00:35:31,361
and I'll take a look
at it, okay? Okay.

807
00:35:31,429 --> 00:35:33,290
Okay, let's go. Come on, Allegra.
- Come on. Let's go.

808
00:35:33,314 --> 00:35:34,664
All right.

809
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:41,538
I need help.

810
00:35:43,508 --> 00:35:46,508
She was just lying in the
street. I almost ran her over.

811
00:35:53,084 --> 00:35:54,324
Okay, we've got this.

812
00:35:54,369 --> 00:35:55,947
Pulse is v-tach.
Where's the crash cart?

813
00:35:55,971 --> 00:35:57,432
360. Sir, step back.

814
00:35:57,456 --> 00:35:58,738
It's all right. I'm a doctor.

815
00:35:58,807 --> 00:36:00,585
Yeah, we're all doctors,
all right? Now move.

816
00:36:00,609 --> 00:36:01,908
Clear.

817
00:36:03,428 --> 00:36:05,195
Charge to 300. Clear.

818
00:36:07,749 --> 00:36:09,215
Sinus tach. We got her.

819
00:36:10,785 --> 00:36:12,352
Okay.

820
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,931
You know where I
can find Dr. Shepherd?

821
00:36:13,955 --> 00:36:14,987
Which one?

822
00:36:16,625 --> 00:36:18,157
Meredith.

823
00:36:18,226 --> 00:36:19,376
No, Dad.

824
00:36:19,444 --> 00:36:21,322
Don't come and clean
up after her again.

825
00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:22,895
You do it every time.

826
00:36:22,964 --> 00:36:24,808
And it's beneath
you, and it's pointless.

827
00:36:24,832 --> 00:36:26,932
I can't do anything
right for her.

828
00:36:27,001 --> 00:36:28,078
Your mother doesn't want...

829
00:36:28,102 --> 00:36:30,383
And I finally figured out why.

830
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:33,640
She wants everyone
around her to be ordinary

831
00:36:33,708 --> 00:36:36,009
so she can be extraordinary.

832
00:36:36,077 --> 00:36:37,922
She wants everyone
around her small.

833
00:36:37,946 --> 00:36:39,062
You stop it.

834
00:36:39,131 --> 00:36:40,875
And that's what
she's done to you.

835
00:36:40,899 --> 00:36:43,533
She has made you small.

836
00:36:43,601 --> 00:36:45,961
And I'm not gonna
let her do it to me.

837
00:37:05,874 --> 00:37:08,308
I don't know what's
wrong with me.

838
00:37:10,011 --> 00:37:13,571
All I know is that the baby
is coming and I want it.

839
00:37:16,851 --> 00:37:18,851
You know, it may change things.

840
00:37:20,505 --> 00:37:22,238
You'll get happier.

841
00:37:23,659 --> 00:37:27,019
We'll just take it one step at
a time. I want to make it work.

842
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:31,865
It isn't your baby.

843
00:37:31,933 --> 00:37:34,534
It's stupid, I know, but
it's a brand-new shirt

844
00:37:34,603 --> 00:37:37,436
and now it's got
junkie blood all over it.

845
00:37:39,607 --> 00:37:40,840
Oh.

846
00:37:40,909 --> 00:37:42,508
This is awkward.

847
00:37:46,064 --> 00:37:47,313
Clear.

848
00:37:47,382 --> 00:37:48,731
I've got a rhythm.

849
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,867
Barely, but...
Damn it. It's gone.

850
00:37:50,936 --> 00:37:52,179
If you had just done
the damn surgery...

851
00:37:52,203 --> 00:37:54,904
Asystole. Give her
1 amp of atropine.

852
00:37:54,973 --> 00:37:56,500
I already did it,
okay? It's not helping.

853
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:58,491
Another, and an
amp of epi. Do it.

854
00:37:59,144 --> 00:38:00,894
Go!

855
00:38:00,962 --> 00:38:02,745
Move. Let's crack her chest.

856
00:38:02,814 --> 00:38:04,213
Gown. What?

857
00:38:04,283 --> 00:38:06,177
No. It's not
indicated. She OD'ed.

858
00:38:06,201 --> 00:38:08,679
Okay, so she's gonna die
anyway. What has she got to lose?

859
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:10,863
Chest tray. WOMAN: Here you go.

860
00:38:11,657 --> 00:38:13,138
Okay, let's do it. Betadine.

861
00:38:13,207 --> 00:38:14,927
10 Blade. - On it.

862
00:38:31,759 --> 00:38:32,809
Are you crying?

863
00:38:36,748 --> 00:38:38,281
I screwed up.

864
00:38:39,318 --> 00:38:41,000
I had a good thing.

865
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:44,040
She was a good person, but...

866
00:38:46,024 --> 00:38:49,258
I had a chance to be better.

867
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:53,446
And I screwed it up like
I do every frickin' time.

868
00:38:53,515 --> 00:38:55,815
What the hell is wrong with me?

869
00:38:57,652 --> 00:38:59,552
I just lost my job.

870
00:38:59,621 --> 00:39:01,554
Do you see me crying?

871
00:39:01,623 --> 00:39:04,891
I have no earthly
idea what to do next,

872
00:39:04,959 --> 00:39:07,477
but am I hiding in an elevator,

873
00:39:07,546 --> 00:39:09,412
whimpering about it?

874
00:39:09,481 --> 00:39:10,497
No.

875
00:39:10,582 --> 00:39:12,148
No.

876
00:39:12,216 --> 00:39:14,667
Because what do we say, Alex?

877
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:16,702
What do we say?

878
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:17,970
We create...

879
00:39:18,039 --> 00:39:20,119
Our own destiny. Our
own destiny. Uh-huh.

880
00:39:21,309 --> 00:39:23,676
And that's exactly
what I'm gonna do.

881
00:39:23,744 --> 00:39:25,345
You should, too.

882
00:39:32,136 --> 00:39:33,302
Guys, you lost her.

883
00:39:33,372 --> 00:39:34,665
Shut up! Shut up!

884
00:39:34,689 --> 00:39:35,949
One more amp of
epi. Charge to 20.

885
00:39:35,973 --> 00:39:37,056
Charging.

886
00:39:37,793 --> 00:39:39,124
Charged.

887
00:39:39,193 --> 00:39:40,493
Clear.

888
00:39:48,569 --> 00:39:49,969
Charge to 30.

889
00:39:50,038 --> 00:39:51,871
Ready? Go. Clear.

890
00:39:53,458 --> 00:39:54,618
Sinus tach.

891
00:39:54,676 --> 00:39:56,092
Wait. Wait.

892
00:39:57,979 --> 00:39:59,795
<i>Your life is a gift.</i>

893
00:39:59,864 --> 00:40:00,980
<i>Accept it.</i>

894
00:40:01,049 --> 00:40:02,677
She's back. Okay,
we got her. We got her.

895
00:40:02,701 --> 00:40:05,268
<i>No matter how screwed
up or painful it seems to be.</i>

896
00:40:08,023 --> 00:40:09,100
Okay, now what do I do?

897
00:40:09,124 --> 00:40:11,824
Okay, lick it, slam
it, and then lime.

898
00:40:11,893 --> 00:40:12,992
Okay.

899
00:40:15,363 --> 00:40:16,729
Fast, fast, fast, fast. Yeah.

900
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:20,483
Okay. That's good.

901
00:40:27,058 --> 00:40:28,458
What?

902
00:40:28,526 --> 00:40:30,071
We don't have to do that
thing where I say something

903
00:40:30,095 --> 00:40:32,128
and then you say something
and then someone cries

904
00:40:32,197 --> 00:40:33,507
and there's a
moment or whatever?

905
00:40:33,531 --> 00:40:34,531
Oh, yuck.

906
00:40:35,901 --> 00:40:37,000
Good.

907
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:42,254
It's just that...

908
00:40:42,323 --> 00:40:45,407
Nothing is turning out
the way I thought it would.

909
00:40:45,476 --> 00:40:48,444
It's like I don't even
recognize my own life.

910
00:40:50,148 --> 00:40:51,881
I know what you mean.

911
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:53,511
<i>Some things are
going to work out</i>

912
00:40:53,535 --> 00:40:55,455
<i>as if they were
destined to happen.</i>

913
00:40:55,503 --> 00:40:59,005
Ugh! I gotta go get some
sleep. You gotta get some sleep.

914
00:41:00,074 --> 00:41:01,874
You look like crap.

915
00:41:01,943 --> 00:41:03,183
I look better than you.

916
00:41:04,028 --> 00:41:05,060
Not possible.

917
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:13,230
Your mother says the
residents have a name for me.

918
00:41:16,023 --> 00:41:18,023
I wouldn't know
anything about that.

919
00:41:18,093 --> 00:41:20,492
What is it? What
do they call me?

920
00:41:22,797 --> 00:41:23,874
Come on.

921
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:25,498
McDreary.

922
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:27,416
We call you McDreary.

923
00:41:29,887 --> 00:41:31,153
You think that's funny?

924
00:41:31,222 --> 00:41:32,302
It's apt.

925
00:41:33,007 --> 00:41:34,273
McDreary.

926
00:41:36,044 --> 00:41:37,409
Yeah, that's my life.

927
00:41:43,768 --> 00:41:46,269
So how about tonight, you're
not McDreary? You're just...

928
00:41:47,272 --> 00:41:49,355
You're just a guy in a bar.

929
00:41:51,859 --> 00:41:54,219
And you're just a girl in a bar?

930
00:41:55,279 --> 00:41:56,379
I am.

931
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:59,165
And I drink tequila.

932
00:42:02,486 --> 00:42:03,686
Tom.

933
00:42:03,754 --> 00:42:05,070
Here you go.

934
00:42:08,426 --> 00:42:09,926
Cheers.

935
00:42:09,995 --> 00:42:12,078
<i>As if they were
just meant to be.</i>
