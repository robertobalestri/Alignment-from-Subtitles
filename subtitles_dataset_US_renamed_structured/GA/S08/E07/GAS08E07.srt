1
00:00:02,103 --> 00:00:03,935
<i>Surgeons can't be lazy.</i>

2
00:00:04,638 --> 00:00:05,871
<i>The risks are too great.</i>

3
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:08,107
That one looks
like an islet cell.

4
00:00:08,175 --> 00:00:09,475
Which one?

5
00:00:09,543 --> 00:00:12,511
That one. It's all puffy
and insulin producing.

6
00:00:13,314 --> 00:00:14,679
It looks like a cloud.

7
00:00:14,748 --> 00:00:17,627
It looks like an islet
cell or maybe a buffalo.

8
00:00:17,651 --> 00:00:19,529
<i>The second we stop
pushing ourselves,</i>

9
00:00:19,553 --> 00:00:21,120
<i>something terrible happens,</i>

10
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:22,954
<i>something we never see coming.</i>

11
00:00:23,024 --> 00:00:25,457
I have no imagination, Mer.

12
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:27,153
Teddy sucked it out of me.

13
00:00:27,177 --> 00:00:28,643
Let's not go there.

14
00:00:28,712 --> 00:00:31,580
We're just gonna believe that
everything's gonna be okay.

15
00:00:32,483 --> 00:00:33,615
We're keeping the faith.

16
00:00:33,683 --> 00:00:35,117
Yeah.

17
00:00:35,185 --> 00:00:38,198
She did say that she had
something great for me today.

18
00:00:38,222 --> 00:00:39,399
What are you on?

19
00:00:39,423 --> 00:00:41,006
Cabbage patch.

20
00:00:41,075 --> 00:00:43,419
OB Still? You gotta get
out of those pink scrubs.

21
00:00:43,443 --> 00:00:46,444
Why? Bailey's got me
blackballed from every surgery.

22
00:00:46,513 --> 00:00:49,281
Besides, it's quiet. I get
to work on the trial stuff.

23
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:51,461
I thought Bailey told you to
stay away from the trial stuff.

24
00:00:51,485 --> 00:00:53,085
I know, but I just can't help it

25
00:00:53,154 --> 00:00:54,794
because I feel like
I'm this close to...

26
00:00:55,506 --> 00:00:56,955
Hey! That coulda hit us.

27
00:00:57,023 --> 00:00:58,423
Careful.

28
00:00:58,492 --> 00:01:00,092
Nice hustle.

29
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,106
You know, I think this is just
more avoiding thinking about Zola.

30
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:04,307
Did you hear something?

31
00:01:04,331 --> 00:01:06,698
No. We've bugged
Janet till she's sick of us,

32
00:01:06,767 --> 00:01:07,878
and she doesn't
really know anything,

33
00:01:07,902 --> 00:01:09,279
so we just have
to wait for the court

34
00:01:09,303 --> 00:01:10,896
to give us a hearing
date, and we're just...

35
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,204
Keeping the faith.
Keeping the faith.

36
00:01:13,274 --> 00:01:14,789
Karev, throw the ball!

37
00:01:17,294 --> 00:01:18,944
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

38
00:01:18,996 --> 00:01:20,823
Come on! Robbins,
don't be afraid of it.

39
00:01:20,847 --> 00:01:23,598
Wait. It flew at my head.

40
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:26,151
Not bad. Not bad.

41
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,552
You like that?

42
00:01:27,621 --> 00:01:30,955
I said not bad. Don't
go crazy. Uh-huh.

43
00:01:31,024 --> 00:01:32,274
Sloan.

44
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:33,486
Sloan. Yo!

45
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,176
Focus. Hello? Okay.

46
00:01:35,245 --> 00:01:36,861
Who is that?

47
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,663
Oh, Julia Canner or Kinney.

48
00:01:38,732 --> 00:01:40,443
She's an ophthalmologist
from Seattle Pres.

49
00:01:40,467 --> 00:01:42,283
Mark's been seeing her.

50
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:43,592
Every night this week.

51
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,570
Yay!

52
00:01:45,639 --> 00:01:47,934
All right, nice throw,
Robbins. That's the way.

53
00:01:47,958 --> 00:01:51,053
Webber, why don't you come down
here and show us how it's done?

54
00:01:51,077 --> 00:01:54,228
Uh, let me finish the chapter. I
need my energy for the game.

55
00:01:54,297 --> 00:01:56,315
In my experience, we'll need it.

56
00:01:56,883 --> 00:01:58,003
Mmm-hmm.

57
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,452
Who's up?

58
00:02:00,521 --> 00:02:02,065
Hunt. All right, come on in.

59
00:02:02,089 --> 00:02:04,234
When are you gonna let me
pitch? I'm a really good pitcher.

60
00:02:04,258 --> 00:02:06,024
We're fine.

61
00:02:06,093 --> 00:02:08,037
Shepherd throws an
unbeatable screwball, all right?

62
00:02:08,061 --> 00:02:10,712
Now, Little Grey, let's go.

63
00:02:13,784 --> 00:02:14,816
Go, Lexie!

64
00:02:14,885 --> 00:02:17,118
Drop the bat. Go,
go. Run to third.

65
00:02:17,187 --> 00:02:20,756
Don't stop. All right. Come
on, everyone. Look alive.

66
00:02:20,824 --> 00:02:23,592
Yang, Grey, you
could at least stand up.

67
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:24,810
Hi, honey.

68
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,528
Looking good, Chief Hunt.

69
00:02:26,596 --> 00:02:27,996
Hi, Chief MacDougall.

70
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:29,664
Make it Brad.

71
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:31,600
I'm surprised to see
you out here, Hunt.

72
00:02:31,685 --> 00:02:33,735
We've had this
field every morning.

73
00:02:33,803 --> 00:02:35,770
Is this your first practice?

74
00:02:35,839 --> 00:02:37,717
Uh, no. No, no. We've been...

75
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:39,358
I would've thought it was.

76
00:02:39,426 --> 00:02:41,809
Kudos for putting a team
together at all this year,

77
00:02:41,878 --> 00:02:43,912
what with all the upheaval
over at Seattle Grace.

78
00:02:43,981 --> 00:02:45,458
Yeah, we've got a
lot of good players...

79
00:02:45,482 --> 00:02:48,216
Webber being ousted,
all that nasty business

80
00:02:48,284 --> 00:02:50,902
with the Alzheimer's
trial being shut down...

81
00:02:50,971 --> 00:02:53,855
No wonder they put a
trauma guy in charge.

82
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:55,824
You must feel like
you're just scrambling

83
00:02:55,892 --> 00:02:58,060
to stop the
hemorrhaging over there.

84
00:02:58,128 --> 00:03:00,040
We got another
half-hour out here or so,

85
00:03:00,064 --> 00:03:02,858
and then we're gonna be ready
to kick your asses tomorrow.

86
00:03:02,882 --> 00:03:05,300
Oh, just a half-hour?

87
00:03:05,368 --> 00:03:06,918
Is that all you need?

88
00:03:09,406 --> 00:03:10,906
Hunt, I gotta go. OWEN: What?

89
00:03:10,974 --> 00:03:12,757
Lexie. We got a consult. - Yeah.

90
00:03:12,826 --> 00:03:14,020
Okay. No. No, wait. We're...

91
00:03:14,044 --> 00:03:15,421
I gotta check on a sick
kid. Can I get a ride?

92
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:16,873
I gotta update the
boards. No, no. Listen, no...

93
00:03:16,897 --> 00:03:18,108
- Is that it?
- No, we're still...

94
00:03:18,132 --> 00:03:18,914
Are we done? Just... Wait!

95
00:03:18,982 --> 00:03:20,081
Hustle.

96
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:21,316
Everyone. No, no.

97
00:03:21,384 --> 00:03:23,064
Whoa! Looks like your
half-hour's up. Wait.

98
00:03:24,805 --> 00:03:27,039
All right, guys.
Come on. Let's do it.

99
00:03:27,107 --> 00:03:28,489
All right.

100
00:03:30,093 --> 00:03:31,459
Got it?

101
00:03:31,528 --> 00:03:33,728
I got third. I got third.

102
00:03:34,365 --> 00:03:36,430
You said "great."
Is it a transplant?

103
00:03:36,499 --> 00:03:38,499
Is it a heterotopic transplant?

104
00:03:38,568 --> 00:03:39,634
No.

105
00:03:39,703 --> 00:03:41,703
But you said "great." Is it big?

106
00:03:41,772 --> 00:03:44,105
It'll probably take
you all morning.

107
00:03:47,177 --> 00:03:49,328
Mr. Felker, this is Dr. Yang.

108
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:52,809
And she will be
performing your angioplasty.

109
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:54,149
Nice to meet you.

110
00:03:58,638 --> 00:04:00,149
Any first year can do this.

111
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:01,600
I thought I was gonna
be working on a heart.

112
00:04:01,624 --> 00:04:03,625
You're gonna be
working on preventing

113
00:04:03,694 --> 00:04:05,627
Mr. Felker from
having a heart attack.

114
00:04:05,695 --> 00:04:09,055
I mean, I thought I was gonna
be working on a heart in the OR.

115
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,549
Is someone gonna
roto-rooter my veins out?

116
00:04:15,805 --> 00:04:16,905
Mmm-hmm.

117
00:04:19,376 --> 00:04:22,093
So I typed it up for you.
Fielding positions, batting order...

118
00:04:22,162 --> 00:04:23,361
It's all right here.

119
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,807
You're a good
administrative assistant.

120
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:26,442
Thank you, sir. That's
not a compliment.

121
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:28,011
I think being Chief
Resident has set you back.

122
00:04:28,035 --> 00:04:31,297
I'd like to see you getting
off the sidelines more.

123
00:04:31,321 --> 00:04:32,398
One, two, three.

124
00:04:32,422 --> 00:04:33,454
Okay, what do we have?

125
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:35,935
Carl Shatler, sanitation
worker, mid 30's.

126
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:37,269
Fell off the back
of a garbage truck,

127
00:04:37,293 --> 00:04:39,038
then hit by a car
backing out of a driveway.

128
00:04:39,062 --> 00:04:41,524
Okay, vitals are stable but
he has multiple contusions,

129
00:04:41,548 --> 00:04:43,348
scalp lac, and
obvious hand injuries.

130
00:04:43,417 --> 00:04:46,918
Carl? Carl, I'm Dr. Hunt.
Do you know where you are?

131
00:04:46,987 --> 00:04:50,639
Can you hear me? GCS 10,
and pupils are equal and reactive.

132
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:53,453
I'm gonna need the
portable x-ray and ultrasound.

133
00:04:53,477 --> 00:04:55,477
Right away.

134
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:58,029
This hand's hamburger.
He's gonna lose some of this.

135
00:04:58,097 --> 00:05:00,097
Oh, God. No! No!

136
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:03,218
Calm down. Kepner,
where is that ultrasound?

137
00:05:03,286 --> 00:05:05,248
Give us some room here, Torres.

138
00:05:05,272 --> 00:05:06,999
Okay, I just need to stabilize
the hand, and then I will...

139
00:05:07,023 --> 00:05:08,784
I said, give us some room. The
hand is not the priority right now.

140
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,525
Fine. Page me when you need me.

141
00:05:10,593 --> 00:05:11,659
Mmm-hmm.

142
00:05:14,765 --> 00:05:15,808
Karev, I need you to sign these.

143
00:05:15,832 --> 00:05:16,909
What is it?

144
00:05:16,933 --> 00:05:18,566
A subpoena for
Zola's medical records.

145
00:05:18,635 --> 00:05:20,179
They're transferring
her care to Seattle Pres.

146
00:05:20,203 --> 00:05:21,631
Wait. Why? We're her doctors.

147
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:22,898
It's a conflict of
interest because

148
00:05:22,922 --> 00:05:24,873
her prospective
parents work here.

149
00:05:24,941 --> 00:05:26,786
That's genius. First they take
her away from Shepherd and Grey,

150
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:28,154
now they want to take
her away from her doctors?

151
00:05:28,178 --> 00:05:29,605
Wait, wait, the file.
You have to sign...

152
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:31,196
Don't worry. I got this.

153
00:05:35,152 --> 00:05:37,392
Let's see. The patient just
flew in from San Francisco.

154
00:05:37,453 --> 00:05:40,554
She has a hypothalamic
hamartoma. What do you know?

155
00:05:40,623 --> 00:05:42,869
HH Tumors are
slow-growing, noncancerous.

156
00:05:42,893 --> 00:05:44,204
They sit in the hypothalamus...

157
00:05:44,228 --> 00:05:45,471
Ms. Bayer, can I help you?

158
00:05:45,495 --> 00:05:47,323
No, it's best if
I just hold her.

159
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:48,507
It's okay, sweetheart.

160
00:05:48,531 --> 00:05:49,608
How long has she been seizing?

161
00:05:49,632 --> 00:05:51,872
This is the fourth one today.

162
00:05:52,986 --> 00:05:54,553
Ah.

163
00:05:54,621 --> 00:05:58,289
It's getting worse, so please
tell me you can help her.

164
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,058
It's tricky.

165
00:06:00,126 --> 00:06:03,895
Charissa's tumor is eccentric. It's
off to one side more than the other.

166
00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:05,963
Protocol is a
subfrontal approach

167
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,965
from here, but
I'd never get it all.

168
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:09,996
The surgeon in
San Francisco said

169
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,964
that even if you just
got a little bit of it,

170
00:06:11,988 --> 00:06:13,833
the symptoms wouldn't be as bad.

171
00:06:13,857 --> 00:06:16,190
For now, until it grows back.

172
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:19,727
We'll take any relief
that we can get.

173
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:22,730
I know the risks, and
I've done my research.

174
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:24,632
And you...

175
00:06:24,701 --> 00:06:28,753
You were successful on
87% of your surgeries last year.

176
00:06:28,822 --> 00:06:31,489
So we want the surgery
and we want you to do it.

177
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:36,105
I'd like to try something else.

178
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:37,209
Excuse me?

179
00:06:37,247 --> 00:06:40,448
I'd like to come in
from here, from above.

180
00:06:40,516 --> 00:06:42,450
I think I'd have a much
better visualization

181
00:06:42,518 --> 00:06:43,879
and I think I could get it all.

182
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:46,438
But none of the eight
other neurosurgeons

183
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:48,666
we talked to even
suggested that.

184
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:51,253
That's because it's
never been done before.

185
00:06:54,948 --> 00:06:57,082
What are the risks?

186
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:58,962
You're passing between
two hemispheres,

187
00:06:58,986 --> 00:07:00,835
so there's a
greater risk of injury,

188
00:07:00,904 --> 00:07:03,104
including short-term
memory loss,

189
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:04,873
um, stroke, and even death.

190
00:07:06,293 --> 00:07:07,559
No.

191
00:07:07,628 --> 00:07:09,260
I can't do that.

192
00:07:10,297 --> 00:07:13,331
I understand. I really do.

193
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,884
A subfrontal approach is
a very standard procedure.

194
00:07:15,952 --> 00:07:17,318
You could probably find another

195
00:07:17,387 --> 00:07:18,764
surgeon who's
qualified to do that.

196
00:07:18,788 --> 00:07:21,038
Can I see the list of
who you talked to?

197
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:22,474
Uh...

198
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:24,792
Yes, but I'd rather have you.

199
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:26,728
Dr. Samuelson is fantastic.

200
00:07:26,796 --> 00:07:29,464
I don't think you could
do better than him.

201
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:31,110
It was very nice
meeting you, Ms. Bayer

202
00:07:31,134 --> 00:07:32,600
and I wish you the best of luck.

203
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,338
So why did I just
have an irate mother

204
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:56,007
claim that you refuse to save
the life of her teenage daughter?

205
00:07:56,076 --> 00:07:58,154
It was a consult
for an HH Tumor.

206
00:07:58,178 --> 00:08:00,190
I told her that with a
transcallosal approach,

207
00:08:00,214 --> 00:08:02,308
I think I could get it all. She
didn't want to take the risk.

208
00:08:02,332 --> 00:08:03,409
It's a free country.

209
00:08:03,433 --> 00:08:05,166
So do it the old-fashioned way.

210
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:07,802
There are plenty of
surgeons in San Francisco

211
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:09,782
as qualified as I am to do that.

212
00:08:09,806 --> 00:08:11,406
But they want you.
They got on a plane.

213
00:08:11,475 --> 00:08:12,618
I won't do it. It
will grow back.

214
00:08:12,642 --> 00:08:14,109
Maybe it won't.

215
00:08:14,177 --> 00:08:15,588
Maybe we should just wait
and see and hope for the best.

216
00:08:15,612 --> 00:08:17,656
Yes. No. I'm not
gonna do that anymore.

217
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,082
I had a kid in a crib in
my bedroom for a while,

218
00:08:21,151 --> 00:08:23,329
and social services
took her away.

219
00:08:23,353 --> 00:08:24,797
And the only thing they're
gonna say to me now

220
00:08:24,821 --> 00:08:27,900
is that you gotta wait and
see and hope for the best.

221
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:30,436
It's frustrating. I get that. I
am sick of half measures.

222
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:32,555
Not in my OR.
Not today. I can't.

223
00:08:32,579 --> 00:08:34,161
I think you can.

224
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:37,983
I think her best shot is in your
hands, and so does that mother.

225
00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:39,491
We don't send
people home, Derek.

226
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:41,720
It's not who we are.
It's not who you are.

227
00:08:43,924 --> 00:08:45,056
You're right.

228
00:08:47,961 --> 00:08:49,155
Don't send her back.

229
00:08:49,179 --> 00:08:50,311
So then you'll do it?

230
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:52,380
No.

231
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:54,730
I'm gonna prove to
her my way will work.

232
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:00,454
So basically what
you're saying is,

233
00:09:00,523 --> 00:09:03,457
the device that you
put in him is defective.

234
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:06,561
I'm saying,

235
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:08,774
you got one of the
original devices,

236
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:11,148
and there are some
kinks to work out.

237
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:12,684
So it's a collectible.

238
00:09:12,753 --> 00:09:14,652
When I die, you should
just put it on eBay.

239
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:16,704
For now, the only issue is that

240
00:09:16,773 --> 00:09:18,751
you have to resume
daily testing...

241
00:09:18,775 --> 00:09:21,993
Because he could become
diabetic again. Is that right?

242
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:25,297
Because the device is
basically a huge failure.

243
00:09:25,365 --> 00:09:26,881
No, it's got some problems.

244
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:29,717
Which she is trying to fix.
That's why they call it a trial.

245
00:09:29,786 --> 00:09:32,965
The good news is, we
figured out what was wrong.

246
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:36,524
And we're trying hard
to figure out how to fix it.

247
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:40,128
Look, I knew the risks when
they put this tiddlywink in me.

248
00:09:40,197 --> 00:09:42,997
Plus, all the checkups
mean I get to see you more.

249
00:09:45,902 --> 00:09:47,769
Don't worry.

250
00:09:47,838 --> 00:09:49,637
You'll figure it out.

251
00:09:55,078 --> 00:09:58,212
Okay, Mr. Felker. I'm going
to insert the catheter now.

252
00:09:58,281 --> 00:10:01,149
I'll guide it up to the arteries
surrounding your heart.

253
00:10:01,217 --> 00:10:03,762
Get ready to see a lot of
cheeseburgers and fries.

254
00:10:03,786 --> 00:10:06,454
I work in fast food.

255
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:08,367
So is this all you do every day,

256
00:10:08,391 --> 00:10:10,603
suck crap out of clogged veins?

257
00:10:10,627 --> 00:10:12,421
Arteries. They're
called arteries.

258
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,407
I'm more of a
renaissance-type guy.

259
00:10:14,431 --> 00:10:17,326
I'm a manager, but I have to
know how to work the fry machine,

260
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:19,662
man the grill, make shakes.

261
00:10:19,686 --> 00:10:20,963
Hell, when everyone
else is busy,

262
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:22,814
I'm even the guy who
mops out the john.

263
00:10:22,838 --> 00:10:25,639
Okay, we're giving you a
little more sedation now.

264
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:29,510
I guess everyone else is
busy. They gave you john duty.

265
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:44,020
Someone looks like they
got worse news than us.

266
00:10:44,044 --> 00:10:45,487
I don't know about you,
but I'm cheered up already.

267
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:49,380
I may have just lost my
pitcher to a brain surgery.

268
00:10:49,449 --> 00:10:51,549
But I'm telling
you, I can pitch.

269
00:10:51,617 --> 00:10:54,279
Honey, you were a pro ballplayer.
Come on. Tell him. Tell him.

270
00:10:54,303 --> 00:10:56,398
Tell him I can pitch.
I've never seen her pitch.

271
00:10:56,422 --> 00:10:58,189
You're a pro ballplayer?

272
00:10:58,258 --> 00:10:59,869
Former. I'm a pro
shipping clerk now.

273
00:10:59,893 --> 00:11:01,904
Can you play tomorrow?
Doesn't he have to work here?

274
00:11:01,928 --> 00:11:04,178
I will hire you now and
fire you after the game.

275
00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:06,997
You are now my
administrative assistant.

276
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:09,395
Can't I be something cool,
like a vascular surgeon or...

277
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:12,770
You can be whatever you want
if you help us beat Seattle Pres.

278
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:14,516
I can help you
beat Seattle Pres.

279
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:17,175
I'm telling you, I can pitch.

280
00:11:17,244 --> 00:11:20,544
Grey, I was just in
giving the Tyson family

281
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:21,733
an update on their preemie,

282
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:23,058
and the mom's
complaining of chest pains.

283
00:11:23,082 --> 00:11:24,527
Already called
Altman for a consult.

284
00:11:24,551 --> 00:11:26,451
Okay, great.

285
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,586
Did you... Have
you talked to Karev?

286
00:11:29,156 --> 00:11:30,388
About?

287
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,740
Well, the court asked
for Zola's medical records.

288
00:11:32,809 --> 00:11:34,508
Why?

289
00:11:34,577 --> 00:11:35,805
It's probably nothing. I mean,
don't read anything into it.

290
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:38,446
I thought you should know.

291
00:11:38,515 --> 00:11:40,281
Thanks. Mmm.

292
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:43,050
Interactive properties of islet
cells? Is that Bailey's thing?

293
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:45,286
I'm working with Bailey on this.

294
00:11:45,355 --> 00:11:46,795
I thought Bailey
was pissed at you.

295
00:11:47,724 --> 00:11:49,323
No. No, we're good.

296
00:11:49,392 --> 00:11:51,809
Oh. Okay. Good, then.

297
00:11:58,901 --> 00:12:00,401
Next in line.

298
00:12:04,073 --> 00:12:06,924
I'm trying to get some information
about this adoption case.

299
00:12:06,993 --> 00:12:08,592
The name is Zola...

300
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:10,678
Family services. What?

301
00:12:10,747 --> 00:12:13,726
Requests for information can be
made in writing to family services.

302
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,199
Uh, look, I'm her doctor.

303
00:12:15,268 --> 00:12:17,135
And they subpoenaed
her medical records...

304
00:12:17,203 --> 00:12:19,081
I can't take your files.

305
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:20,271
Look, I'm not asking you to.

306
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:22,251
I just want to talk to
someone about this adoption.

307
00:12:22,275 --> 00:12:24,742
It takes six to eight
weeks to process requests.

308
00:12:25,678 --> 00:12:27,344
Never mind.

309
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:28,713
Next.

310
00:12:28,781 --> 00:12:30,159
Where do I write?
What's the address?

311
00:12:30,183 --> 00:12:31,449
This address.

312
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:34,430
Office of Family Court
Services, fifth floor.

313
00:12:34,454 --> 00:12:36,020
Fifth floor. Thanks.

314
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:37,955
So CT's negative
for internal bleeding,

315
00:12:38,024 --> 00:12:39,769
so Chief Hunt says
Mr. Shatler's all yours.

316
00:12:39,793 --> 00:12:41,959
Oh, that's super.

317
00:12:42,028 --> 00:12:44,840
Tell Chief Hunt I'm so grateful
he gave me the go-ahead.

318
00:12:44,864 --> 00:12:47,064
Okay, was that sarcastic?

319
00:12:48,585 --> 00:12:50,084
Sorry.

320
00:12:50,152 --> 00:12:52,431
Uh, is there any chance you
need an assist on that hand?

321
00:12:52,455 --> 00:12:53,532
I need more OR Time.

322
00:12:53,556 --> 00:12:55,205
Sure. Go schedule an OR.

323
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:56,974
Oh, and wish me luck.

324
00:12:57,043 --> 00:13:00,728
I'm about to tell a guy his
crappy day just got crappier.

325
00:13:00,796 --> 00:13:04,515
Considering all you went
through, you were lucky, really.

326
00:13:04,584 --> 00:13:06,917
That sounds like a
setup for bad news.

327
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:09,553
Uh...

328
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,400
Some of the bones in
your hand were pulverized.

329
00:13:11,424 --> 00:13:13,636
There was extensive
nerve and tissue damage.

330
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:15,504
I'll know more once we get
in the OR and clean it up.

331
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:18,841
But there's a chance you
could lose these two fingers.

332
00:13:18,865 --> 00:13:21,444
Look, I know it's a shock, but
you survived a terrible accident...

333
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:24,001
Holy crap. What are
you... What are you doing?

334
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:25,569
No, no, that's not a weapon.

335
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,672
That's a spitsticker.

336
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:31,626
I do woodcarving, wood prints.

337
00:13:31,694 --> 00:13:33,527
I carry this stuff
with me 'cause

338
00:13:33,596 --> 00:13:35,379
I have a lot of
downtime on my job.

339
00:13:37,534 --> 00:13:38,999
Okay.

340
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:40,201
Um...

341
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:42,403
I'm sorry. It's
just, you kinda...

342
00:13:42,472 --> 00:13:44,283
Yeah. And that scared
the hell outta me.

343
00:13:44,307 --> 00:13:46,441
I was just looking for
my phone to call my wife.

344
00:13:46,509 --> 00:13:48,409
Okay.

345
00:13:48,477 --> 00:13:49,889
Are you gonna freak out if I
stick my hand in here again?

346
00:13:49,913 --> 00:13:50,945
No.

347
00:13:56,969 --> 00:13:58,152
Wow. This...

348
00:13:58,988 --> 00:14:00,888
This is gorgeous.

349
00:14:00,956 --> 00:14:02,876
Can I... Yeah.

350
00:14:05,161 --> 00:14:07,428
Wow. Do you...

351
00:14:07,497 --> 00:14:08,796
Do you sell this stuff?

352
00:14:08,865 --> 00:14:11,799
No, no. Collecting garbage
pays the bills. This...

353
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:14,185
This keeps me sane.

354
00:14:15,055 --> 00:14:16,820
Or it did...

355
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:18,071
Till today.

356
00:14:19,292 --> 00:14:20,972
You might want
to leave the room.

357
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:23,077
She's gonna be pretty upset.

358
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:27,485
Make sure you
tell her that I'm...

359
00:14:28,768 --> 00:14:31,202
I'm something of
an artist myself.

360
00:14:32,822 --> 00:14:34,066
How about now? Any lights?

361
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:36,357
Yeah. Supplemental motor area.

362
00:14:36,425 --> 00:14:38,303
Great. I just paralyzed
the whole left side.

363
00:14:38,327 --> 00:14:41,162
So she's completely paralyzed.

364
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:42,696
We hit the right side earlier.

365
00:14:42,765 --> 00:14:43,864
Mmm.

366
00:14:44,968 --> 00:14:46,868
All right.

367
00:14:46,936 --> 00:14:49,604
Let's try another angle.

368
00:14:49,672 --> 00:14:51,116
Ding. Damn. What was that?

369
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,557
Fornix. Ooh!
Through to the basilar.

370
00:14:53,626 --> 00:14:55,459
So she'd be a...

371
00:14:55,528 --> 00:14:57,461
Mute, memory loss, brain dead.

372
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:58,796
How's it going?

373
00:14:58,864 --> 00:15:00,893
I just can't find a
clean approach.

374
00:15:00,917 --> 00:15:03,184
Lexie, shut down the monitor.

375
00:15:03,252 --> 00:15:05,186
I guess I owe the mom a surgery.

376
00:15:05,272 --> 00:15:08,406
No, no, no. No, not
yet. Not yet. Try it again.

377
00:15:08,475 --> 00:15:10,119
All right, now you're
really getting on my nerves.

378
00:15:10,143 --> 00:15:12,623
I'm just practicing
my coaching skills.

379
00:15:13,346 --> 00:15:15,706
Seriously, Shepherd.
Pick up the damn probe.

380
00:15:24,624 --> 00:15:26,544
All right. Turn it back on.

381
00:15:29,946 --> 00:15:31,626
Ding.

382
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:43,191
Teddy gave me a
marathon angioplasty.

383
00:15:43,259 --> 00:15:45,093
Her "great" thing
was a plumbing job.

384
00:15:45,161 --> 00:15:47,442
They've subpoenaed
Zola's medical records.

385
00:15:49,249 --> 00:15:51,348
That's good. It's movement.

386
00:15:53,036 --> 00:15:54,252
What are you doing?

387
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,115
I'm gonna e-mail Janet and
see if she knows anything.

388
00:15:57,139 --> 00:15:59,023
We're keeping the faith, right?

389
00:15:59,092 --> 00:16:01,703
Did I mention, I can't crack
this islet cell thing either?

390
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:04,840
I've been researching responses
all day to an insulin challenge,

391
00:16:04,864 --> 00:16:06,664
and just nothing.

392
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:09,283
See that? That right there?

393
00:16:09,352 --> 00:16:12,619
Ooh! Yeah! That
used to be a curly fry.

394
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,239
And I used to be a surgeon.

395
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:18,310
Janet.

396
00:16:18,378 --> 00:16:19,554
You're right. You
keep the faith.

397
00:16:19,578 --> 00:16:22,346
"Dear client, I will be
out of the office all week."

398
00:16:25,535 --> 00:16:27,279
I've been picturing
her making calls,

399
00:16:27,303 --> 00:16:28,781
fighting the good fight
to get me my kid back,

400
00:16:28,805 --> 00:16:30,616
not sitting on a
beach somewhere.

401
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,490
I know. Mer...

402
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:34,840
Zola's probably
forgotten us by now.

403
00:16:47,607 --> 00:16:48,872
Uh...

404
00:16:51,311 --> 00:16:52,810
Excuse me.

405
00:16:52,878 --> 00:16:54,990
I'm trying to get some
information about an adoption case.

406
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,025
I'm sure you'll make
a wonderful father,

407
00:16:57,049 --> 00:16:58,994
but until the judge
rules a case closed...

408
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,385
I'm not the dad. I'm the
doctor. The kid's sick and...

409
00:17:01,454 --> 00:17:04,494
Sweetheart, I've heard
every sad story in the book.

410
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:06,868
It doesn't change the fact that
we don't release information

411
00:17:06,892 --> 00:17:08,192
on pending cases.

412
00:17:09,562 --> 00:17:11,763
You know, I couldn't
help but notice

413
00:17:11,831 --> 00:17:14,365
the dysplastic nevus, the mole.

414
00:17:14,434 --> 00:17:15,599
What?

415
00:17:15,668 --> 00:17:17,188
Yeah, anyone ever
check that for you?

416
00:17:17,404 --> 00:17:18,903
Yes, but...

417
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:20,582
They said it's not dangerous.

418
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:21,838
Not now anyway.

419
00:17:21,907 --> 00:17:24,458
Me? I wouldn't take that chance.

420
00:17:24,527 --> 00:17:26,360
Oh, dear. Oh, right.

421
00:17:26,429 --> 00:17:28,229
Crappy government insurance.

422
00:17:28,298 --> 00:17:29,897
That would be on the deductible.

423
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:34,351
Look, I'm a surgeon.

424
00:17:34,421 --> 00:17:35,969
You give me the
stats on this kid,

425
00:17:36,038 --> 00:17:37,538
I'll take care of you for free.

426
00:17:48,334 --> 00:17:50,312
Yeah, she's on Judge
Brentner's docket.

427
00:17:50,336 --> 00:17:52,836
Let's see if...

428
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:55,617
Wait. He's not even here
today. He's getting chemo.

429
00:17:55,641 --> 00:17:59,276
So sad. Prostate.

430
00:17:59,345 --> 00:18:02,641
You're a doctor. Is that
one of the bad ones?

431
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:04,198
Not necessarily.

432
00:18:04,267 --> 00:18:06,533
Depends on where
he's getting it treated.

433
00:18:12,275 --> 00:18:14,074
It could be postpartum
cardiomyopathy.

434
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:15,876
I'll transfer her to telemetry.

435
00:18:15,944 --> 00:18:17,311
Okay.

436
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:19,213
Dr. Altman.

437
00:18:19,282 --> 00:18:21,393
Why is Cristina
doing an angioplasty?

438
00:18:21,417 --> 00:18:22,850
Excuse me?

439
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:24,997
I was just wondering,
and I know she was, too.

440
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:27,065
Is this all going somewhere?

441
00:18:27,089 --> 00:18:28,467
I mean, I know it's none
of my business, but...

442
00:18:28,491 --> 00:18:29,773
You're right.

443
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:35,212
As a first year, you do an
angio to learn a technical skill,

444
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:38,232
but an angio as a fifth year
is about learning respect...

445
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,800
Respect for the heart disease

446
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:42,335
that Cristina will see
for the rest of her career.

447
00:18:42,404 --> 00:18:44,888
It all starts there,
in the artery.

448
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:47,891
You have to go back to the
beginning to understand the end.

449
00:18:54,483 --> 00:18:56,567
Back to the beginning.

450
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:57,846
All right, so move
Avery to shortstop

451
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:58,914
and put Bailey in center field.

452
00:18:58,938 --> 00:19:00,505
Bailey? Why Bailey?

453
00:19:00,573 --> 00:19:02,784
Because Bailey's a leader.
She'll know who to get the ball to.

454
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:06,294
She's not your cutoff man.
Avery, he's your cutoff man.

455
00:19:06,362 --> 00:19:08,402
She's tall. Where
do you have her?

456
00:19:08,948 --> 00:19:10,948
Uh, left field. Can she catch?

457
00:19:11,684 --> 00:19:13,217
Let's find out.

458
00:19:14,169 --> 00:19:15,436
Grey, catch.

459
00:19:16,339 --> 00:19:17,638
Hunt, what the hell?

460
00:19:17,707 --> 00:19:20,724
Now he's your cutoff man. Yeah.

461
00:19:20,793 --> 00:19:23,560
I've been looking for you. I
need my mother's journals.

462
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:24,928
Why? What's up?

463
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:26,892
I need to see her
original hypothesis.

464
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:28,393
If I'm gonna figure
out what's going on,

465
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:29,844
then I need to start
where she started.

466
00:19:29,868 --> 00:19:31,001
Aha!

467
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:32,548
Aha! I knew once
you picked it up,

468
00:19:32,572 --> 00:19:33,971
you couldn't put it down.

469
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,840
Don't gloat. Where
are they? Come on.

470
00:19:37,477 --> 00:19:38,557
Nice.

471
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:41,907
The patient and her
mother are wondering

472
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:43,491
if she's having surgery today.

473
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:45,760
Should I tell them that
you are still working?

474
00:19:45,784 --> 00:19:49,453
We are working. Sometimes the
body thinks better than the brain.

475
00:19:51,207 --> 00:19:52,573
Grey, toss him a ball.

476
00:19:52,641 --> 00:19:55,042
Hello. Yeah. Yeah.

477
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:57,845
I thought the board meeting
would be pushed to Thursday.

478
00:19:59,214 --> 00:20:00,397
Your swing's too high.

479
00:20:01,484 --> 00:20:02,850
Did you play ball?

480
00:20:02,919 --> 00:20:04,830
Yeah. I was a pitcher. Really?

481
00:20:04,854 --> 00:20:06,019
Yeah.

482
00:20:06,088 --> 00:20:08,005
Right, into the parking...

483
00:20:08,073 --> 00:20:09,273
Mark's in love.

484
00:20:09,342 --> 00:20:12,409
With an eye doctor.
That should last 48 hours.

485
00:20:12,478 --> 00:20:15,045
Yeah, I should be happy for him.

486
00:20:15,114 --> 00:20:17,426
Don't worry about. Just
shake it off or shake it out

487
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:19,178
or I don't know,
shake something.

488
00:20:19,202 --> 00:20:20,478
It's his new coaching persona.

489
00:20:20,502 --> 00:20:22,203
Yeah, I'm still working on it.

490
00:20:24,657 --> 00:20:26,137
You're still coming at it wrong.

491
00:20:26,191 --> 00:20:27,791
You're approaching
the ball wrong.

492
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,605
I'm holding the bat wrong?

493
00:20:29,629 --> 00:20:30,494
No, no, no, it's not
the bat. It's your body.

494
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:33,247
You need to adjust your head,

495
00:20:33,316 --> 00:20:34,765
drop your shoulder.

496
00:20:34,817 --> 00:20:37,351
I mean, you're not connecting.

497
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:43,260
The head's at the wrong angle.

498
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:44,987
I've been adjusting the probe.

499
00:20:45,011 --> 00:20:47,171
You need to adjust
the angle of her head.

500
00:20:52,201 --> 00:20:54,835
I went back to the lab
to test my approach.

501
00:20:54,904 --> 00:20:58,305
There's a very good shot I can
access the tumor from above.

502
00:20:58,374 --> 00:21:00,185
I think we can get it all.

503
00:21:00,209 --> 00:21:01,775
A good shot?

504
00:21:01,844 --> 00:21:03,110
This is my child.

505
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:04,857
Mmm. There are risks either way,

506
00:21:04,881 --> 00:21:07,241
but this certainly
has more risks.

507
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:10,351
So she could die in surgery.

508
00:21:10,419 --> 00:21:13,420
Look, thank you for
trying, Dr. Shepherd, but I...

509
00:21:13,489 --> 00:21:15,773
I can't let my little
girl be your guinea pig.

510
00:21:18,961 --> 00:21:20,527
Mrs. Bayer,

511
00:21:20,596 --> 00:21:23,898
now in all your research,
have you ever found a story

512
00:21:23,966 --> 00:21:26,617
of a kid with an HH
Tumor who ever got better?

513
00:21:28,254 --> 00:21:30,771
Who ever got a job, had a life?

514
00:21:34,309 --> 00:21:36,744
This is the best
shot you'll have.

515
00:21:50,209 --> 00:21:52,626
Altman. Sloan, you're on first.

516
00:21:52,695 --> 00:21:55,713
Bailey, you're center field.
We're doing some shuffling.

517
00:21:55,781 --> 00:21:57,192
What are you doing here?

518
00:21:57,216 --> 00:21:58,899
I work here.

519
00:21:58,968 --> 00:22:00,546
Uh, I may not even
make the game.

520
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:03,970
I got 49 trial
patients left to call.

521
00:22:04,039 --> 00:22:06,451
I gotta give them the
same bad news I gave you.

522
00:22:06,475 --> 00:22:09,254
Ouch! That's rough. We
need a sub for center field.

523
00:22:09,278 --> 00:22:11,328
Yeah. Shepherd, pitcher.

524
00:22:11,397 --> 00:22:14,181
Shepherd's out. He told me his
brain surgery could be a marathon.

525
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:15,616
Oh! Me. Let me pitch.

526
00:22:16,119 --> 00:22:17,317
Okay.

527
00:22:17,386 --> 00:22:18,897
All right, Altman, pitcher. Yes.

528
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:19,987
Sloan, first.

529
00:22:20,056 --> 00:22:21,099
Shepherd can be a pinch hitter.

530
00:22:21,123 --> 00:22:22,222
Okay, Torres, you're on...

531
00:22:22,291 --> 00:22:24,475
I need you to sign for this.

532
00:22:24,543 --> 00:22:26,755
Bone plates and titanium
mesh? That's a lot of hardware.

533
00:22:26,779 --> 00:22:28,857
I thought you said this guy's
hand wasn't salvageable.

534
00:22:28,881 --> 00:22:31,409
Yeah, I'm gonna try and
rebuild it. It's gonna be really cool.

535
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:32,733
April, meet me in the OR.

536
00:22:32,801 --> 00:22:34,418
I need a small.

537
00:22:34,487 --> 00:22:36,403
They're all larges. What?

538
00:22:36,472 --> 00:22:38,839
No. We can't be
out of smalls already.

539
00:22:38,908 --> 00:22:41,308
I told them we needed
an assortment of sizes.

540
00:22:41,394 --> 00:22:43,343
I was very clear on the phone.

541
00:22:44,964 --> 00:22:46,847
Sweet.

542
00:22:46,916 --> 00:22:49,200
I'll look fantastic in this.

543
00:22:49,268 --> 00:22:50,946
And when you look
good, you play good.

544
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:52,850
Am I right, Avery? You know it.

545
00:22:55,491 --> 00:22:57,491
What the hell was that? What?

546
00:22:57,559 --> 00:22:59,388
What, are you guys
pledging Delta Chi together?

547
00:22:59,412 --> 00:23:01,211
No, Sloan's pretty
cool, actually.

548
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,960
He's been in such
a good mood lately,

549
00:23:03,015 --> 00:23:05,499
he's letting me do
half his procedures.

550
00:23:05,568 --> 00:23:07,300
He let me run the
burn center last night.

551
00:23:09,505 --> 00:23:10,582
Neat.

552
00:23:10,606 --> 00:23:11,905
Okay.

553
00:23:11,974 --> 00:23:13,206
Okay, Grey, you're...

554
00:23:16,262 --> 00:23:18,396
Winning is an
attitude. We're winners.

555
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:20,163
Yeah.

556
00:23:23,369 --> 00:23:26,704
Okay, so this will
hold his hand in place

557
00:23:26,772 --> 00:23:28,739
so I can see the
tendon and nerve gaps...

558
00:23:28,807 --> 00:23:30,936
What the Chief doesn't realize
is that a lot of the work I do

559
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,588
makes it possible for these
surgeries to take place.

560
00:23:33,612 --> 00:23:37,281
I mean, all the staffing
and scheduling...

561
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:40,295
I mean, so okay, maybe I'm
not in the OR all the time...

562
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:41,559
April. But I...

563
00:23:41,587 --> 00:23:42,964
Do you want to be an
administrative assistant?

564
00:23:42,988 --> 00:23:44,266
Is that what makes
your heart sing?

565
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:45,622
No, of course not.

566
00:23:45,691 --> 00:23:48,825
Then stop being a whiner.
Stop hiding behind paperwork.

567
00:23:48,894 --> 00:23:51,178
If you love it, do it.
Just get in the OR.

568
00:23:51,247 --> 00:23:53,814
Okay? Don't sleep, don't eat.

569
00:23:53,882 --> 00:23:55,983
Just do this.

570
00:23:57,386 --> 00:23:58,685
Here.

571
00:23:58,754 --> 00:24:00,264
You want me to place the k-wire?

572
00:24:00,288 --> 00:24:02,622
Will it make your heart sing?

573
00:24:02,692 --> 00:24:04,920
Yes. Yeah, right.

574
00:24:04,944 --> 00:24:06,977
Okay, placing the wire.

575
00:24:07,046 --> 00:24:08,223
Okay. You're a little
too far to the left.

576
00:24:08,247 --> 00:24:09,487
Okay, I got it. Sorry.

577
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:11,491
There you go. Right
there. Good. That's all right.

578
00:24:12,551 --> 00:24:14,395
I didn't do anything. I
swear. Damn it. No, just stop.

579
00:24:14,419 --> 00:24:15,464
What's going on? I don't
know but his pressure's tanking.

580
00:24:15,488 --> 00:24:16,837
I'm hanging blood.

581
00:24:16,905 --> 00:24:18,833
It looks like
electrical alternans.

582
00:24:18,857 --> 00:24:21,424
He's tamponading. What
the hell? Page cardio.

583
00:24:21,494 --> 00:24:23,760
These things I need
done. Is that okay?

584
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:25,162
Thank you. Thank you.

585
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:27,030
Sorry.

586
00:24:27,099 --> 00:24:28,165
What is that?

587
00:24:29,018 --> 00:24:30,258
Uh, my mom's journal.

588
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:32,986
No, I know what it is.
Why do you have it?

589
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:35,175
Because it's my mom's journal.

590
00:24:43,048 --> 00:24:44,926
Freeze it.

591
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:47,167
Intraluminal flap and
pericardial effusion.

592
00:24:47,235 --> 00:24:48,847
Damn it. He's got a
dissection. That's why he fell.

593
00:24:48,871 --> 00:24:50,415
It must have started
when he was on the truck.

594
00:24:50,439 --> 00:24:51,938
He probably passed out.

595
00:24:52,007 --> 00:24:53,190
We need to get Altman.

596
00:24:53,259 --> 00:24:54,507
Why? Do we need to go...

597
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:55,837
Yes, we need to
open him right now.

598
00:24:55,861 --> 00:24:57,222
Um, April, start
the thoracotomy.

599
00:24:57,246 --> 00:24:58,612
What? Me? What are you doing?

600
00:24:58,681 --> 00:25:00,647
Getting gowned and
gloved. Crack his chest.

601
00:25:00,716 --> 00:25:02,216
But I'm assisting.

602
00:25:02,284 --> 00:25:03,595
It's all right. I got
this. Go do your thing.

603
00:25:03,619 --> 00:25:05,297
But I've never done
an aortic dissection.

604
00:25:05,321 --> 00:25:06,921
April, crack his chest now.

605
00:25:07,523 --> 00:25:08,688
10-blade.

606
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:10,837
Here you go, Doctor. Thank you.

607
00:25:23,488 --> 00:25:24,800
Okay, here's the tear.

608
00:25:24,824 --> 00:25:26,623
Okay, open the
aorta longitudinally.

609
00:25:29,712 --> 00:25:33,296
Now, transect proximal
to the innominate artery.

610
00:25:35,451 --> 00:25:37,650
Are you sure you
don't want to do this?

611
00:25:37,719 --> 00:25:38,802
You're already there.

612
00:25:40,172 --> 00:25:41,333
All right. What do we have?

613
00:25:41,357 --> 00:25:43,223
A thoracic aortic dissection.

614
00:25:43,292 --> 00:25:46,794
Kepner excised the defect
and he's going to need a graft.

615
00:25:46,862 --> 00:25:49,641
All right. Let me get
scrubbed. You'll first assist.

616
00:25:49,665 --> 00:25:52,027
Torres, can you clear out?
Can you work around me?

617
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:53,211
I mean, I'll move
if I have to, but...

618
00:25:53,235 --> 00:25:54,567
Torres, I'm trying to...

619
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:56,181
I know, but trust me,
I'm saving his life, too.

620
00:25:56,205 --> 00:25:58,205
Can you work around me? Fine.

621
00:26:01,109 --> 00:26:03,337
Yang, why didn't you
just start the graft?

622
00:26:03,361 --> 00:26:05,195
I didn't need to. Kepner had it.

623
00:26:10,452 --> 00:26:11,852
Okay.

624
00:26:11,921 --> 00:26:13,298
I've got some
of it, but I need to

625
00:26:13,322 --> 00:26:15,402
change the angle
to get the rest of it.

626
00:26:16,558 --> 00:26:18,638
Okay, let's release
the Mayfield, please.

627
00:26:18,677 --> 00:26:21,995
I need you to hold the probe
steady so I can adjust the angle.

628
00:26:22,898 --> 00:26:24,230
You're not taking it out?

629
00:26:24,299 --> 00:26:26,266
It's too risky.

630
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:29,587
If we go outside of the track,
we could hit healthy brain tissue.

631
00:26:29,655 --> 00:26:31,154
Come on. Take the probe.

632
00:26:31,223 --> 00:26:34,157
Hold it still. Move it even
one millimeter, it's over.

633
00:26:34,226 --> 00:26:36,426
Ready? Let's give it a whirl.

634
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:39,195
Okay, good. I think...

635
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:41,744
The tumor's dropped into the
field. Let's tighten the device.

636
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:44,234
Okay. Good job.

637
00:26:44,303 --> 00:26:46,737
Okay, let's start
the aspiration.

638
00:26:46,806 --> 00:26:48,205
Very slowly.

639
00:26:50,342 --> 00:26:51,842
Go ahead.

640
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:58,276
Heart rate's 130.
What's happening?

641
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:00,166
The tumor is pulling
on the hypothalamus.

642
00:27:00,236 --> 00:27:02,269
Push 20 of labetalol, please.

643
00:27:02,338 --> 00:27:03,937
Grey, hold the retractor.

644
00:27:04,006 --> 00:27:05,272
Let me take this.

645
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:06,990
Heart rate's 160.

646
00:27:07,058 --> 00:27:09,326
Damn it. I'm pulling
out the probe.

647
00:27:09,395 --> 00:27:10,505
But you just said we're not g...

648
00:27:10,529 --> 00:27:11,878
We don't have a choice.

649
00:27:21,757 --> 00:27:24,190
What do we do now?
There's still tumor left.

650
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:29,212
We try again.

651
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:47,731
Why didn't you just start the
graft yourself? Why'd you wait?

652
00:27:48,817 --> 00:27:50,061
Is this a trick question?

653
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:51,585
No. I'm asking.

654
00:27:51,654 --> 00:27:54,266
Come on. Now I'm in
trouble for waiting for you?

655
00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:56,535
You would've ripped me
a new one if I did it myself.

656
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:58,353
Two months ago, you
would've bodychecked Kepner

657
00:27:58,377 --> 00:28:00,076
in order to get into
this guy's chest,

658
00:28:00,145 --> 00:28:01,823
and now you let her
just do the surgery?

659
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:03,108
And you don't even like Kepner.

660
00:28:03,132 --> 00:28:04,281
This is true.

661
00:28:05,718 --> 00:28:08,830
Yes, I could've done it
myself, but she had it.

662
00:28:08,854 --> 00:28:10,086
Exactly.

663
00:28:12,491 --> 00:28:14,257
I'm done here.

664
00:28:14,326 --> 00:28:15,387
Okay, then could you
girls take it outside?

665
00:28:15,411 --> 00:28:17,077
Some of us have
a long way to go.

666
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:27,865
I give up. I have no idea
what you're trying to do.

667
00:28:27,889 --> 00:28:30,168
I am in trouble if I cut.
I'm in trouble if I don't cut.

668
00:28:30,192 --> 00:28:32,370
I'm a fifth year who
does the work of an intern.

669
00:28:32,394 --> 00:28:33,471
What do you want?

670
00:28:33,495 --> 00:28:35,462
I want you to make a list.

671
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:38,464
Okay, where on a blackboard?

672
00:28:38,533 --> 00:28:41,579
"I will not do any surgeries
without a safety helmet."

673
00:28:41,603 --> 00:28:43,637
I want you to make
a list of every surgery

674
00:28:43,705 --> 00:28:46,206
that you have ever
dreamed of performing.

675
00:28:46,274 --> 00:28:47,657
Mmm-hmm.

676
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:50,660
Shoot for the moon, and
I will try to get you some.

677
00:28:53,549 --> 00:28:55,248
Because we're done.

678
00:28:55,317 --> 00:28:57,667
You've graduated.
This is your present.

679
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:02,039
You're messing with me.

680
00:29:02,108 --> 00:29:03,719
All right, you know, at
the beginning of this year,

681
00:29:03,743 --> 00:29:06,259
you nearly killed
Alex Karev in that OR.

682
00:29:06,328 --> 00:29:08,328
Because you just
had to get in there,

683
00:29:08,397 --> 00:29:11,197
you had to be the best,
and you had to be first.

684
00:29:11,266 --> 00:29:13,700
But today...

685
00:29:13,769 --> 00:29:16,403
Today I saw a different surgeon,

686
00:29:16,472 --> 00:29:21,140
every bit as good,
every bit as advanced,

687
00:29:21,209 --> 00:29:23,309
but you were willing
to work on a team.

688
00:29:23,379 --> 00:29:25,128
Today...

689
00:29:25,197 --> 00:29:27,730
You put the patient
before yourself.

690
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,050
And that...

691
00:29:30,119 --> 00:29:32,719
Is who I wanted to see. So...

692
00:29:34,423 --> 00:29:35,822
You're done.

693
00:29:37,409 --> 00:29:38,892
Make a list.

694
00:29:49,705 --> 00:29:51,605
What...

695
00:29:51,674 --> 00:29:54,152
What the hell are you
doing in here? One second.

696
00:29:54,176 --> 00:29:56,070
In a second, I'm a
kick you in your sorry...

697
00:29:56,094 --> 00:29:57,906
I just need to see
if the cell survived.

698
00:29:57,930 --> 00:29:59,907
Yes! Yes! The cell survived.

699
00:29:59,931 --> 00:30:01,197
What are you talking about?

700
00:30:01,266 --> 00:30:02,944
My mom was wrong. It's oxygen.

701
00:30:02,968 --> 00:30:04,795
The cells aren't
getting enough oxygen.

702
00:30:04,819 --> 00:30:08,572
She extrapolated the amount
delivered based on tests with mice,

703
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,675
but the internal structure
of an islet cell of a mouse

704
00:30:11,743 --> 00:30:14,143
is completely different
than that of a human.

705
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:16,574
Her hypothesis was wrong.

706
00:30:16,598 --> 00:30:19,038
That's why the islet cells
in your device are dying.

707
00:30:20,185 --> 00:30:21,718
I marked the page for you.

708
00:30:32,297 --> 00:30:34,009
You mean it's
gone? You got it all?

709
00:30:34,033 --> 00:30:36,043
Yes, we won't know where
we are for a couple of days...

710
00:30:36,067 --> 00:30:38,534
But yeah, I did. I got it all.

711
00:30:38,603 --> 00:30:40,003
Wait. So, what?

712
00:30:40,072 --> 00:30:42,272
So no more seizures, and
she won't freak out anymore?

713
00:30:42,341 --> 00:30:44,724
She is a teenager, so
chances are she might.

714
00:30:44,793 --> 00:30:46,393
Yeah, but not
because of the tumor.

715
00:30:56,305 --> 00:30:57,804
The fingers...

716
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,906
They're all there.

717
00:30:59,975 --> 00:31:02,192
I had to build you a
new skeletal framework,

718
00:31:02,261 --> 00:31:04,572
jerry-rigged some wire
through these bolts here,

719
00:31:04,596 --> 00:31:06,913
but yeah, saved your hand.

720
00:31:09,334 --> 00:31:10,367
Will it work?

721
00:31:10,436 --> 00:31:11,801
It should.

722
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:14,249
There'll be some follow-up
surgery and physical therapy...

723
00:31:14,273 --> 00:31:16,206
A lot of physical therapy,

724
00:31:16,275 --> 00:31:19,109
but you should
regain full mobility.

725
00:31:19,178 --> 00:31:20,226
I...

726
00:31:21,764 --> 00:31:22,896
It's beautiful.

727
00:31:24,232 --> 00:31:25,264
Thank you.

728
00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:30,903
See? I told you
she was an artist.

729
00:31:41,216 --> 00:31:43,683
Uh, Mr. Brentner?

730
00:31:43,752 --> 00:31:45,202
Yes?

731
00:31:50,276 --> 00:31:51,276
How am I doing?

732
00:31:51,794 --> 00:31:53,259
Uh...

733
00:31:53,329 --> 00:31:56,663
Someone will be in to
speak with you shortly.

734
00:31:57,883 --> 00:31:59,460
Look, I'm sorry to bother you,

735
00:31:59,484 --> 00:32:01,446
but I need to talk to you
about something else.

736
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:03,798
You have a kid on your
docket, Zola. She's from Africa...

737
00:32:03,822 --> 00:32:07,057
I'm sorry, but I can't
discuss a case...

738
00:32:07,126 --> 00:32:10,221
Look, just hear me out. I'm
Zola's doctor. She's got spina bifida.

739
00:32:10,245 --> 00:32:12,590
Two doctors want to adopt
her. They're just waiting to hear.

740
00:32:12,614 --> 00:32:14,342
But for weeks now, she's
been stuck in a foster home.

741
00:32:14,366 --> 00:32:16,182
This is highly inappropriate.

742
00:32:16,251 --> 00:32:18,596
A sick kid like that shouldn't
be with a foster family.

743
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:20,081
She needs to be in a stable home

744
00:32:20,105 --> 00:32:21,582
with good parents,
these parents.

745
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:23,001
Without that, she's
only gonna get worse.

746
00:32:23,025 --> 00:32:24,936
- Excuse me. Nurse? I need...
- I'll be right with you.

747
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:28,320
Don't bother. I'm leaving,
okay? I'm leaving. Just...

748
00:32:28,379 --> 00:32:31,258
All I'm asking for you to do
is to take a look at this case.

749
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:33,667
That's it. Please
just take a look.

750
00:32:39,474 --> 00:32:41,591
Doctor.

751
00:32:41,659 --> 00:32:44,661
Attempting to influence a
judge is a federal offense.

752
00:32:59,962 --> 00:33:01,945
Let's go, Shepherd!

753
00:33:07,852 --> 00:33:09,368
Yeah!

754
00:33:16,461 --> 00:33:18,161
Aw!

755
00:33:18,229 --> 00:33:21,064
All right. All right. All right,
Karev, you're on second.

756
00:33:21,133 --> 00:33:23,027
Let's get out there and
get it back. We can do it.

757
00:33:23,051 --> 00:33:24,417
We are down 8-0.

758
00:33:24,486 --> 00:33:26,297
We're screwed. He
should just call it now.

759
00:33:26,321 --> 00:33:28,481
The new Chief's got
something to prove.

760
00:33:29,357 --> 00:33:31,324
You still got your...

761
00:33:32,094 --> 00:33:33,509
Yeah.

762
00:33:33,578 --> 00:33:35,422
All right, come on,
Brechman! You can do it!

763
00:33:35,446 --> 00:33:36,924
Come on, dude! Ring it up!
- Here we go! Here we go!

764
00:33:36,948 --> 00:33:38,381
Hit it out of the park!

765
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:39,727
Hit it out of the
park! That's right!

766
00:33:39,751 --> 00:33:41,151
He's got it. He's got it.

767
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,630
- All right.
- Yeah, you do!

768
00:33:42,654 --> 00:33:44,037
Go! Yeah!

769
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:45,705
- Keep your eye on it.
- Here we go!

770
00:33:47,492 --> 00:33:48,891
Get the walk!

771
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,243
Mmm.

772
00:33:50,312 --> 00:33:53,597
Off-pump quintuple
cabbage. Do you have a pen?

773
00:33:53,665 --> 00:33:54,709
What are you doing?

774
00:33:54,733 --> 00:33:56,032
I'm making a list.

775
00:33:56,101 --> 00:33:59,369
Teddy told me to make
a bucket list of surgeries.

776
00:33:59,438 --> 00:34:02,756
I kept the faith, Mer. Who
thought that would pay off?

777
00:34:05,878 --> 00:34:07,994
It's not paying off for me.

778
00:34:08,063 --> 00:34:10,423
My faith is currently
out of the office.

779
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:13,783
Maybe I cured diabetes, though.

780
00:34:15,771 --> 00:34:17,170
Your mom would've been proud.

781
00:34:19,558 --> 00:34:20,873
No, she wouldn't.

782
00:34:20,942 --> 00:34:22,208
Probably not.

783
00:34:25,747 --> 00:34:27,029
Oh, God.

784
00:34:28,534 --> 00:34:30,483
Here we go. WOMAN:
Show 'em your stuff.

785
00:34:32,671 --> 00:34:33,937
Seriously? Really?

786
00:34:34,005 --> 00:34:35,672
You want to pitch?

787
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,874
Whoa! Hey! What are
you doing out here?

788
00:34:37,943 --> 00:34:40,610
I'm a roving
outfielder. I'm roving.

789
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:43,012
I'm roving. I'm...

790
00:34:47,536 --> 00:34:49,736
Yes! Yes!

791
00:34:49,804 --> 00:34:51,288
My God! It's coming here!

792
00:34:51,356 --> 00:34:52,722
I got it! I got it!

793
00:34:52,791 --> 00:34:54,431
Get it! Get it!
Get it! I got it!

794
00:34:56,862 --> 00:34:57,944
Ball hog!

795
00:34:58,013 --> 00:34:59,533
I had that. Oh, did you?

796
00:34:59,564 --> 00:35:02,182
Or were you gonna let it
fall to the ground again?

797
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,786
What is your problem with me?

798
00:35:06,855 --> 00:35:07,921
I beg your pardon?

799
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:09,550
I don't want on
your stupid trial.

800
00:35:09,574 --> 00:35:10,818
I just need to get
it out of my head.

801
00:35:10,842 --> 00:35:12,391
No, Mer... Are you drunk?

802
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:14,611
She is. We are.

803
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,407
So, what is your problem?

804
00:35:16,431 --> 00:35:18,281
What is my problem?

805
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:19,849
All right, I'll tell
you my problem.

806
00:35:19,918 --> 00:35:21,500
My problem is you.

807
00:35:21,569 --> 00:35:24,020
Everywhere I look,
you're all in my trial,

808
00:35:24,088 --> 00:35:26,823
coming in my lab,
opening my doors...

809
00:35:26,892 --> 00:35:28,812
What's going on out
there? I'm not sure.

810
00:35:29,644 --> 00:35:32,929
Time-out. I got this, Hunt.

811
00:35:32,998 --> 00:35:34,180
Can he do that?

812
00:35:34,248 --> 00:35:36,933
He seems to think he can.

813
00:35:37,002 --> 00:35:38,946
Oh, this must be pretty
humiliating for you.

814
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:42,539
Yeah, you're gonna look so hot
when you get tagged out at home plate.

815
00:35:42,607 --> 00:35:44,106
Oh, in your dreams.

816
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:49,078
God, get a room.
It's disgusting.

817
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:50,430
Give the guy a break.

818
00:35:50,498 --> 00:35:52,232
She's on the opposing team.

819
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:54,445
So what? He seems happy.

820
00:35:54,469 --> 00:35:56,135
He's happy, I'm happy.

821
00:35:59,708 --> 00:36:02,124
And you and me,
we're happy, right?

822
00:36:02,194 --> 00:36:05,195
Oh, what is with the friggin'
holdup? Let's play ball!

823
00:36:06,914 --> 00:36:09,449
You are reckless
and irresponsible...

824
00:36:09,534 --> 00:36:12,746
But it was between me and
the Chief and my husband,

825
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:14,887
so mind your own damn business!

826
00:36:14,956 --> 00:36:16,217
You are not the boss of me.

827
00:36:16,241 --> 00:36:18,435
Oh, thank God for that.

828
00:36:18,459 --> 00:36:20,805
We're lucky to even be
able to have a trial after you...

829
00:36:20,829 --> 00:36:23,429
Shut up! The both of you.

830
00:36:23,498 --> 00:36:25,732
Now you, you
have a lot of nerve,

831
00:36:25,801 --> 00:36:28,968
rubbing Meredith's nose in her
mistakes when you can't fix your own.

832
00:36:29,037 --> 00:36:30,537
Your trial is failing.

833
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:32,525
Like it or not, you need her.

834
00:36:32,574 --> 00:36:36,092
And you, even your mom, the
great Ellis Grey, made a mistake.

835
00:36:36,144 --> 00:36:38,544
You fixed hers.
Now fix your own.

836
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:40,107
Get out of those
ridiculous pink scrubs

837
00:36:40,131 --> 00:36:42,426
and get back to the
work you were born to do.

838
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:44,595
Now the two of you are gonna
figure out a way to work together,

839
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:46,230
but you're not gonna
do it on this field.

840
00:36:46,254 --> 00:36:49,455
You'll do it Monday morning
in the lab. Is that clear?

841
00:36:49,524 --> 00:36:51,244
Yes. Mmm-hmm.

842
00:36:54,245 --> 00:36:55,561
Play ball!

843
00:36:56,415 --> 00:36:57,730
We playing ball.

844
00:36:57,799 --> 00:36:59,115
Playing ball.

845
00:37:15,283 --> 00:37:17,701
That's gonna make it 12-0.

846
00:37:17,769 --> 00:37:19,613
How long are we
gonna let this go on for?

847
00:37:19,637 --> 00:37:21,982
She'll get there. If she can just
get a better drive off the mound...

848
00:37:22,006 --> 00:37:24,140
She's terrible. Yeah, she sucks.

849
00:37:24,209 --> 00:37:27,276
Oh! Want to call it, Hunt?
Team's looking a little tired.

850
00:37:27,345 --> 00:37:29,079
Wouldn't want anyone
napping in the OR.

851
00:37:29,147 --> 00:37:31,648
The last thing you guys
need is a malpractice suit.

852
00:37:33,451 --> 00:37:35,184
All right. We're
pulling the pitcher.

853
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:36,852
Shepherd, get your glove.

854
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:40,923
No, no, not me. Lexie, get
your glove. Run out there.

855
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:43,726
Great job, hon. You
threw a really good game.

856
00:37:43,795 --> 00:37:45,594
Come on. Let's go
ice your shoulder.

857
00:37:45,663 --> 00:37:47,391
No. I'm just warming
up. Get outta here.

858
00:37:47,415 --> 00:37:48,498
Come on. There's beer.

859
00:37:50,051 --> 00:37:52,030
Now come on. No.
Let me try again.

860
00:37:52,054 --> 00:37:53,603
Honey, we're
running out of time.

861
00:37:53,671 --> 00:37:55,783
No, no way. We got
like five more innings.

862
00:37:55,807 --> 00:37:57,440
No, I'm running out of time.

863
00:37:57,509 --> 00:37:59,987
Is this really how you want to
spend our last few moments together?

864
00:38:00,011 --> 00:38:02,529
Give me the ball. I can
feel my device failing.

865
00:38:02,597 --> 00:38:03,647
Come on.

866
00:38:04,916 --> 00:38:06,766
I hate you so much. I know.

867
00:38:06,835 --> 00:38:09,519
All right, all right.
Time-out. Time-out.

868
00:38:09,588 --> 00:38:11,432
- You just took a time-out.
- Another one?

869
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:12,622
Are you kidding me?

870
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:13,806
Bring it in. Huddle up.

871
00:38:14,576 --> 00:38:15,825
All right.

872
00:38:19,614 --> 00:38:22,114
I just want to say how
proud I am of all of you.

873
00:38:22,183 --> 00:38:24,334
You are an incredible team.

874
00:38:24,402 --> 00:38:25,746
Now who's drunk? Get off.

875
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:28,087
I've watched you work together,

876
00:38:28,156 --> 00:38:29,506
solve problems together.

877
00:38:29,574 --> 00:38:33,559
I watched you teach each
other and learn from each other.

878
00:38:33,628 --> 00:38:37,130
You step up when
you need to and you...

879
00:38:38,366 --> 00:38:40,286
You do more than
anyone asks you to do.

880
00:38:43,104 --> 00:38:44,632
You're the finest team
I've ever been a part of.

881
00:38:44,656 --> 00:38:46,450
My God. DEREK: What
are you talking about?

882
00:38:46,474 --> 00:38:48,135
- That's really sad.
- Beautiful.

883
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:50,171
You don't think we actually
have a shot at winning this.

884
00:38:50,195 --> 00:38:52,962
What, this? This? No,
no, no, we're screwed.

885
00:38:53,031 --> 00:38:57,867
You are all horrible at
softball. But as doctors,

886
00:38:57,935 --> 00:39:00,704
you're pretty great, and I am
proud just to get to lead you,

887
00:39:00,772 --> 00:39:02,706
and you're all
here, so I just...

888
00:39:03,474 --> 00:39:04,940
I just wanted to tell you.

889
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:06,442
But now...

890
00:39:06,511 --> 00:39:08,144
Now we're going down.

891
00:39:08,213 --> 00:39:11,514
So what do you say
we go down fighting?

892
00:39:11,583 --> 00:39:12,648
Yes!

893
00:39:14,452 --> 00:39:15,685
One, two, three.

894
00:39:15,754 --> 00:39:16,869
Go, team!

895
00:39:17,705 --> 00:39:19,906
Yeah! All right!

896
00:39:19,974 --> 00:39:21,068
Here we go. Here we go.

897
00:39:21,092 --> 00:39:22,291
All right. Come on, guys!

898
00:39:22,343 --> 00:39:23,504
Let's go, Lexie!
You can do this!

899
00:39:23,528 --> 00:39:25,195
Come on! Here we go!

900
00:39:25,263 --> 00:39:26,712
Good game.

901
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:27,858
Good game.

902
00:39:27,882 --> 00:39:29,232
Spread out!

903
00:39:29,301 --> 00:39:30,550
There it is.

904
00:39:32,019 --> 00:39:33,887
No arm! No arm.

905
00:39:33,955 --> 00:39:35,449
This is your relief pitcher?

906
00:39:35,473 --> 00:39:39,141
My grandma's not busy,
she can pitch better than that.

907
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:40,988
Right in the boob. MARK: Lexie!

908
00:39:41,012 --> 00:39:43,480
What? I thought she
was stealing second.

909
00:39:46,501 --> 00:39:48,278
For the love of God!
She's a surgeon, Hunt.

910
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:50,887
That could've been
her hand. I'm calling it!

911
00:39:50,956 --> 00:39:53,540
So, okay. So you forfeit?

912
00:39:53,625 --> 00:39:55,069
No, we killed you. Game over!

913
00:39:55,093 --> 00:39:56,942
You forfeit. That was a forfeit.

914
00:40:00,999 --> 00:40:03,159
<i>So we may not always be winners.</i>

915
00:40:05,036 --> 00:40:06,803
<i>But we're not lazy.</i>

916
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,239
<i>We take chances.</i>

917
00:40:11,042 --> 00:40:12,876
<i>We go for broke.</i>

918
00:40:14,045 --> 00:40:15,945
<i>We swing for the fences.</i>

919
00:40:16,715 --> 00:40:19,015
<i>And sometimes, yeah,</i>

920
00:40:19,718 --> 00:40:21,284
<i>we strike out.</i>

921
00:40:21,352 --> 00:40:23,631
Thank you, guys, for
letting me be your ringer.

922
00:40:23,655 --> 00:40:24,832
Although, I didn't
really ring much.

923
00:40:24,856 --> 00:40:26,300
It was more like a thunk, but...

924
00:40:26,324 --> 00:40:27,768
All right, will you
take me home?

925
00:40:27,792 --> 00:40:30,409
I will take you home.

926
00:40:30,478 --> 00:40:33,507
Come on. We've got
Mark as a sitter, so...

927
00:40:33,531 --> 00:40:34,930
I'm taking you home.

928
00:40:37,001 --> 00:40:38,729
His girlfriend's
gonna be okay, right?

929
00:40:38,753 --> 00:40:42,889
Ah, it's her boob.
She's in good hands.

930
00:40:45,726 --> 00:40:49,278
Are you gonna tell me
what that was about or what?

931
00:40:49,347 --> 00:40:51,363
Yeah, I thought she
was stealing second.

932
00:40:53,351 --> 00:40:54,884
No, you didn't.

933
00:40:58,089 --> 00:40:59,789
Shh.

934
00:40:59,858 --> 00:41:02,091
I think I hear my heart singing.

935
00:41:02,928 --> 00:41:04,828
Can you hear that?

936
00:41:04,896 --> 00:41:05,973
La, la... Are you drunk?

937
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,211
Yeah, I'll give you a ride home.

938
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:14,743
Be in the lab before rounds.

939
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:18,707
I will.

940
00:41:19,911 --> 00:41:21,627
Good job, Chief.

941
00:41:21,696 --> 00:41:23,540
You made it
through four innings.

942
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:26,015
Two more than any
team I've ever fielded.

943
00:41:28,019 --> 00:41:30,436
Can I do a
heterotopic transplant?

944
00:41:30,504 --> 00:41:33,005
Tonight? No.

945
00:41:33,074 --> 00:41:35,658
Good call. You're a good Chief.

946
00:41:36,527 --> 00:41:37,760
Come on.

947
00:41:38,997 --> 00:41:40,997
Good night.

948
00:41:41,066 --> 00:41:43,032
I'm good. You're fine, too.

949
00:41:44,235 --> 00:41:45,475
That was a massacre.

950
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:46,703
Yeah.

951
00:41:46,771 --> 00:41:48,065
I don't think we did that bad.

952
00:41:48,089 --> 00:41:49,422
Oh, yeah.

953
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:53,387
Where were you yesterday?

954
00:41:53,411 --> 00:41:55,478
I was doing stuff.

955
00:41:55,547 --> 00:41:57,558
Why do you look so sad?

956
00:41:57,582 --> 00:41:58,931
Don't be so sad. Look.

957
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,433
I just got a message from Janet.

958
00:42:00,502 --> 00:42:03,002
I guess the judge
got in touch with her.

959
00:42:03,071 --> 00:42:05,688
He's looking at Zola's files.
We're gonna get a court date.

960
00:42:05,757 --> 00:42:07,056
We're getting a hearing?

961
00:42:07,108 --> 00:42:08,841
We have a hearing.
We got a hearing.

962
00:42:11,329 --> 00:42:13,096
We're getting a hearing.

963
00:42:13,965 --> 00:42:15,014
Oh, come on.

964
00:42:15,082 --> 00:42:17,049
<i>But sometimes,</i>

965
00:42:17,118 --> 00:42:18,751
<i>ya get a home run.</i>
