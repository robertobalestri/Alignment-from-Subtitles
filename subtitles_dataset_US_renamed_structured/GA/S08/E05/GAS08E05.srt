1
00:00:05,306 --> 00:00:06,605
<i>The human body</i>

2
00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:08,673
<i>is designed to
compensate for loss.</i>

3
00:00:12,996 --> 00:00:16,698
<i>It adapts so it no longer
needs the thing it can't have.</i>

4
00:00:21,672 --> 00:00:23,182
Guess we should
take the crib down.

5
00:00:23,206 --> 00:00:25,385
Oh, no. I'm just sorting
through the clothes

6
00:00:25,409 --> 00:00:27,387
that Zola's grown out of
so I can give them away.

7
00:00:27,411 --> 00:00:28,811
I mean, she's so big now,

8
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:31,112
when she comes back,
she'll never fit into these.

9
00:00:31,181 --> 00:00:32,792
We haven't heard
anything in weeks.

10
00:00:32,816 --> 00:00:34,945
Janet said it was gonna take
a while, and it's taking a while.

11
00:00:34,969 --> 00:00:36,552
Just be patient.

12
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,119
Just fold these. It helps.

13
00:00:38,188 --> 00:00:40,406
I don't know why, but it helps.

14
00:00:40,474 --> 00:00:42,808
She's coming back.

15
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:45,410
<i>But sometimes a
loss is too great,</i>

16
00:00:45,478 --> 00:00:49,430
<i>and the body can't
compensate on its own.</i>

17
00:00:49,499 --> 00:00:51,800
<i>That's when
surgeons get involved.</i>

18
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:11,320
Stop it. I am making breakfast.

19
00:01:11,388 --> 00:01:12,454
You don't cook.

20
00:01:12,523 --> 00:01:13,603
I do...

21
00:01:13,657 --> 00:01:15,457
Sometimes.

22
00:01:15,526 --> 00:01:18,043
Here. Try these.

23
00:01:18,112 --> 00:01:22,314
Eggs cooked almost
entirely with my left hand.

24
00:01:22,383 --> 00:01:25,543
Teddy said the best cardio
surgeons have two dominant hands.

25
00:01:25,602 --> 00:01:26,913
It's like a superpower.

26
00:01:26,937 --> 00:01:29,037
So I am in training.

27
00:01:29,123 --> 00:01:30,333
Want some more?

28
00:01:30,357 --> 00:01:31,773
You know, I think...

29
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:33,959
I think I want something else.

30
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:35,267
Oh, no.

31
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:44,369
That's my superpower.
I only use one hand, too.

32
00:01:50,111 --> 00:01:51,960
Hey. Where are you going?

33
00:01:52,029 --> 00:01:53,512
To visit Molly for two days.

34
00:01:53,564 --> 00:01:54,774
Oh, that's great.

35
00:01:54,798 --> 00:01:56,478
Jackson arranged
it. It was a surprise.

36
00:01:56,917 --> 00:01:58,016
Oh.

37
00:01:58,085 --> 00:02:00,346
What do you mean by
that? Nothing. Just "oh."

38
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:01,698
'Cause it sounded
like you meant,

39
00:02:01,722 --> 00:02:03,766
"Really, he arranged for
you to go visit your sister

40
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,718
"at the exact time his
mother's coming into town?

41
00:02:05,742 --> 00:02:07,575
"Guess he's not
really that into you,

42
00:02:07,644 --> 00:02:09,038
"otherwise, he'd want you to meet
his mother like a normal person."

43
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:10,289
No. You had a mother.

44
00:02:10,313 --> 00:02:12,447
Jackson and I had
surgeons who procreated.

45
00:02:12,515 --> 00:02:13,960
It's just a little complicated.

46
00:02:13,984 --> 00:02:15,417
I shouldn't go, right?

47
00:02:15,486 --> 00:02:17,314
No, I think it's sweet
that he wants you

48
00:02:17,338 --> 00:02:18,631
to get out of the line of fire.

49
00:02:19,757 --> 00:02:20,789
That's my cab.

50
00:02:20,858 --> 00:02:22,390
Yeah, I should stay.

51
00:02:22,459 --> 00:02:25,939
I think you should probably get
out while you have the chance.

52
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:36,571
Morning.

53
00:02:37,374 --> 00:02:38,823
I'm in your OR today.

54
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:40,159
I can see that.

55
00:02:40,227 --> 00:02:41,271
It's not gonna be
a problem, is it?

56
00:02:41,295 --> 00:02:42,335
No.

57
00:02:42,396 --> 00:02:45,446
Good, good, 'cause
I was avoiding you,

58
00:02:45,515 --> 00:02:47,165
and now I'm not.

59
00:02:47,234 --> 00:02:49,445
See, I'm told you're dating
a nurse, and kudos to you,

60
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:51,736
'cause who doesn't
love a nurse, but...

61
00:02:51,805 --> 00:02:52,845
I've been bringing lattes

62
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:54,739
to some dude in
scheduling named Pierre

63
00:02:54,808 --> 00:02:56,608
so he'd keep me
out of your surgeries.

64
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:58,388
You know, I wanted to
make it easier for you,

65
00:02:58,412 --> 00:02:59,789
since you told me you were being

66
00:02:59,813 --> 00:03:02,163
held together by tape and glue.

67
00:03:02,232 --> 00:03:04,532
But now that you're being
held together by a male nurse,

68
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:07,602
I'm gonna let Pierre go
ahead and get his own lattes.

69
00:03:07,671 --> 00:03:09,404
See you in surgery.

70
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:13,608
Hey, Miranda. You
coming to dinner tonight?

71
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:15,661
Yeah.

72
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:18,029
And is it just you and Eli

73
00:03:18,098 --> 00:03:20,732
or will Ben's butt
be joining us, too?

74
00:03:21,669 --> 00:03:22,762
Joking.

75
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:25,386
That was... That's just a joke.

76
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:28,106
I'll assume that it's
just two for dinner,

77
00:03:28,175 --> 00:03:29,975
and you can... Bye.

78
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,346
Hey, I saw the board.

79
00:03:34,414 --> 00:03:36,982
Three islet device surgeries
and a follow-up on Henry,

80
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,316
spreading it a little thin.

81
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:40,063
You concerned
about me or your trial?

82
00:03:40,087 --> 00:03:41,186
No, your trial.

83
00:03:41,255 --> 00:03:42,966
Well, the way you're
trying to micromanage me,

84
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:44,433
it seems like you
still think it's yours.

85
00:03:44,457 --> 00:03:46,502
Yeah, but Meredith Grey's
stepping away from neuro.

86
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:47,737
I mean, she needs a new focus,

87
00:03:47,761 --> 00:03:49,961
and you could use the
help. She's got a gift.

88
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,229
It's a gift, all right.

89
00:03:51,298 --> 00:03:52,530
She could be a real asset.

90
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:54,299
The answer is no.

91
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,636
Ugh!

92
00:03:57,705 --> 00:04:00,739
I can't believe Altman postponed
our surgery for grand rounds.

93
00:04:00,807 --> 00:04:02,608
It's just a boring lecture.

94
00:04:02,676 --> 00:04:04,937
Your husband said
it was mandatory.

95
00:04:04,961 --> 00:04:07,028
One more hour of
sleep, that's what it is.

96
00:04:07,097 --> 00:04:08,558
Oh, no. It's not
gonna be boring.

97
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:11,249
This is Jackson's
mother, Catherine Avery.

98
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:12,528
She's a urologist, right?

99
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:14,731
Yeah. I met her when I
was an intern at Mercy West.

100
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:16,187
She's amazing.

101
00:04:16,257 --> 00:04:17,756
She is a lunatic.

102
00:04:17,825 --> 00:04:19,874
No, she's not. She's brilliant.

103
00:04:19,943 --> 00:04:21,453
She says these
things that shock you,

104
00:04:21,477 --> 00:04:23,395
but then when you
think about them later,

105
00:04:23,464 --> 00:04:24,696
they change your whole life.

106
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:26,342
Or they ruin your whole life.

107
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:27,877
She's toxic. She's a meddler.

108
00:04:27,901 --> 00:04:29,951
My mom has no
boundaries. Be warned.

109
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,153
Hey, is that why you
shipped Lexie out of state?

110
00:04:32,222 --> 00:04:34,189
What? Oh. You shipped Lexie...

111
00:04:34,974 --> 00:04:37,008
Wow.

112
00:04:37,076 --> 00:04:39,289
Who hides his girlfriend under a
rock while his mom comes into town?

113
00:04:39,313 --> 00:04:42,809
Someone who's got a
hypercritical surgeon for a mom.

114
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:44,049
I get it.

115
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,450
Is your mom ambidextrous?

116
00:04:45,518 --> 00:04:47,953
I bet you she is. All
the best surgeons are.

117
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:49,883
Wait a second. How often
do you talk to my mom?

118
00:04:49,907 --> 00:04:51,406
We're Facebook friends.

119
00:04:51,474 --> 00:04:53,135
You're... You and my mother?

120
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:55,327
She's a brilliant
surgeon and woman.

121
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:56,795
She's a trailblazer.

122
00:04:56,863 --> 00:04:58,324
And she's got a stalker.

123
00:04:58,348 --> 00:05:01,549
Hey, you know what?
Just meet her. You'll see.

124
00:05:01,618 --> 00:05:03,262
So do you want us to
bring anything tonight?

125
00:05:03,286 --> 00:05:04,931
Nope. I got it covered. Thanks.

126
00:05:04,955 --> 00:05:06,904
What's tonight? A dinner party.

127
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,317
Teddy and Henry's new place.

128
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:11,175
You're... You're not invited.

129
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:13,694
Why? You're the babysitter.

130
00:05:13,764 --> 00:05:15,563
Wake up, everybody.

131
00:05:15,632 --> 00:05:18,216
I know, I know,
it's grand rounds,

132
00:05:18,284 --> 00:05:20,302
where we have to sit
and listen to somebody

133
00:05:20,387 --> 00:05:22,504
talk about how
somebody did something

134
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:24,338
and here's how they did it,

135
00:05:24,408 --> 00:05:26,402
and there's not enough
coffee in Brazil for this.

136
00:05:27,728 --> 00:05:29,193
Well, not today.

137
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:31,830
Today we are going to do.

138
00:05:31,899 --> 00:05:34,466
Today I'm going to change a life

139
00:05:34,535 --> 00:05:36,434
and maybe make
medical history, too.

140
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:37,769
And I can't do it alone,

141
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:40,905
so who wants to step
into the future with me?

142
00:05:40,974 --> 00:05:42,056
Whoo!

143
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:46,627
Okay. That's all
right. That's a start.

144
00:05:46,714 --> 00:05:49,047
Let's see if I can
get a few more.

145
00:05:49,116 --> 00:05:51,276
Ryan, honey, would you
come out here, please?

146
00:05:52,469 --> 00:05:54,435
Everybody, this is Ryan.

147
00:05:54,504 --> 00:05:55,653
Hi.

148
00:05:55,722 --> 00:05:58,106
Ryan, could you show everybody

149
00:05:58,175 --> 00:06:00,324
what we're here to do today?

150
00:06:13,556 --> 00:06:14,840
Ladies and gentlemen,

151
00:06:14,908 --> 00:06:17,943
I'd like to invite a few
very lucky residents

152
00:06:18,011 --> 00:06:20,112
to scrub in on
this country's first

153
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,796
penis transplant.

154
00:06:36,797 --> 00:06:39,413
Thanks to a case
of penile cancer,

155
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:43,418
Ryan underwent a full
penectomy 11 months ago.

156
00:06:43,487 --> 00:06:47,007
Good margins left him
basically cured and cancer-free.

157
00:06:47,757 --> 00:06:49,157
So that's gone.

158
00:06:49,226 --> 00:06:52,738
And today we'll be replacing
the other thing Ryan lost.

159
00:06:52,762 --> 00:06:54,740
A suitable donor's
become available

160
00:06:54,764 --> 00:06:56,684
here at Seattle
Grace-Mercy West,

161
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:59,217
and Ryan generously
agreed to fly out

162
00:06:59,286 --> 00:07:01,953
and make this day a
teaching opportunity.

163
00:07:02,021 --> 00:07:03,471
Who wants in on it?

164
00:07:04,457 --> 00:07:06,691
Hello! That's more like it.

165
00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:09,795
Uh, Mark Sloan, plastics.

166
00:07:09,863 --> 00:07:11,562
Isn't penile reconstruction

167
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:14,366
the standard approach
in cases like these?

168
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,050
Why a transplant?

169
00:07:16,119 --> 00:07:19,054
Well, I can answer your
question with a question.

170
00:07:19,122 --> 00:07:20,922
Do you like your penis?

171
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:22,510
Yes.

172
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:24,175
It does the job.

173
00:07:24,244 --> 00:07:26,911
If one day, it wasn't there,
wouldn't you want it back?

174
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:30,198
Or would you be satisfied
with a reconstructed organ

175
00:07:30,267 --> 00:07:32,100
that has very little function?

176
00:07:32,168 --> 00:07:33,429
Satisfied? No.
But that's not the...

177
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,370
Neither would Ryan here.

178
00:07:35,438 --> 00:07:37,805
Yes, this is new ground.

179
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:41,004
But here's a young man with
his whole life ahead of him,

180
00:07:41,028 --> 00:07:42,905
with the will to live
it as a whole man,

181
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:45,080
with a bravery and
selflessness to help

182
00:07:45,165 --> 00:07:47,164
advance medical
science along the way.

183
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:50,151
So let's give Ryan
a hand. Come on!

184
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:55,924
Whoo!

185
00:07:55,992 --> 00:07:58,275
And now let's give Ryan a penis!

186
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:00,312
Yes!

187
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:08,586
So nice to see you
again, too, really.

188
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:09,854
Thank you. Thank you.

189
00:08:09,922 --> 00:08:11,567
Gotta make a big
show out of everything.

190
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:13,308
There's my baby boy.

191
00:08:13,376 --> 00:08:15,110
Hi, Mom. Come here.

192
00:08:15,178 --> 00:08:17,712
Ooh! You look skinny.

193
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:18,864
You're not sleeping?

194
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:20,615
Hey, I'm fine, mom. Mmm.

195
00:08:20,683 --> 00:08:22,817
Which one is she?
She's a brunette, right?

196
00:08:22,886 --> 00:08:24,630
We're not doing
this today, okay?

197
00:08:24,654 --> 00:08:26,070
Maybe the real question is,

198
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:27,839
what kind of name is Lexie?

199
00:08:27,908 --> 00:08:28,952
I never told you her name.

200
00:08:28,976 --> 00:08:30,007
I have my ways.

201
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:31,125
Where is she?

202
00:08:31,194 --> 00:08:32,738
She's not here.
She's out of town.

203
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:35,763
I come into town, and you
smuggle her across state lines?

204
00:08:35,832 --> 00:08:37,477
Are you ashamed
of her? Dr. Avery,

205
00:08:37,501 --> 00:08:39,411
sorry to interrupt.
Interrupt, please.

206
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:41,970
Oh, Mark Sloan, plastics.
The man who doubts.

207
00:08:42,055 --> 00:08:44,856
Listen, I'm all for standing
up for the Johnson,

208
00:08:44,925 --> 00:08:46,119
but this is a transplant,

209
00:08:46,143 --> 00:08:48,976
and transplant
patients reject organs.

210
00:08:49,045 --> 00:08:50,962
Now I see a 28-year-old guy

211
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:53,998
who could have a pretty good
life with a reconstructed organ

212
00:08:54,067 --> 00:08:55,828
that my boy here and I
could make tomorrow.

213
00:08:55,852 --> 00:08:57,184
Excuse me.

214
00:08:57,253 --> 00:08:58,820
You're working with Jackson?

215
00:08:58,889 --> 00:09:00,549
I'm mentoring him.
He didn't mention it?

216
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:02,023
No, he didn't.

217
00:09:02,092 --> 00:09:04,453
Got a great set of hands,
this kid. You should be proud.

218
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:05,943
Why don't you scrub in with me?

219
00:09:06,012 --> 00:09:08,095
And you can tell me
all the reasons why.

220
00:09:08,164 --> 00:09:09,764
I'll be there. All right.

221
00:09:11,984 --> 00:09:13,412
Can't you just stay out of it?

222
00:09:13,436 --> 00:09:16,271
He's your mentor. Why
not get to know the man?

223
00:09:16,339 --> 00:09:18,289
At least he didn't skip town.

224
00:09:18,358 --> 00:09:19,974
All right.

225
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:22,755
No, I said I'm not competing.

226
00:09:22,779 --> 00:09:25,313
Come on. It's gonna be the
microsurgery Olympics in there.

227
00:09:25,382 --> 00:09:27,148
You're gonna kill it.

228
00:09:27,217 --> 00:09:29,779
Exactly, and then I'm stuck in
the OR with my mom for 12 hours?

229
00:09:29,803 --> 00:09:31,480
Forget it. Man up.

230
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:33,437
This is a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity.

231
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:36,040
This kind of thing will
look good on your boards.

232
00:09:36,109 --> 00:09:38,276
Now get in there
and make me proud.

233
00:09:44,735 --> 00:09:48,586
Who has worked with the
tissue of the penis before?

234
00:09:48,655 --> 00:09:50,416
Kepner, keep your
hand down. Shh.

235
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:54,592
Its delicate vascularity
demands a grace and elegance

236
00:09:54,661 --> 00:09:59,096
that not many surgeons of
your station have mastered.

237
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:02,867
The two surgeons to do the
best end-to-end anastomosis

238
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:05,887
of their chicken's femoral
vessels will scrub in with me.

239
00:10:05,955 --> 00:10:07,489
So be cautious,

240
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:09,707
be careful,

241
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:11,275
be brilliant...

242
00:10:11,928 --> 00:10:12,977
Begin!

243
00:10:31,814 --> 00:10:33,648
Yes! You have no idea how...

244
00:10:33,717 --> 00:10:34,877
No.

245
00:10:34,901 --> 00:10:36,746
Sorry, sweetie.
You're too tense.

246
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:38,403
You're all wound up.

247
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,638
This isn't woodshop.

248
00:10:40,707 --> 00:10:42,340
Step to the back.

249
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:50,414
You need to lay
off the lattes, dear.

250
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:53,201
Your left hand is shaking
like a motel bedspring.

251
00:10:53,269 --> 00:10:54,380
It's just tired.

252
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:57,055
I hear you, honey.
Aren't we all?

253
00:10:57,123 --> 00:10:58,622
Step to the back.

254
00:10:58,691 --> 00:11:00,674
It's very simple, people.

255
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:03,111
All it has to be is perfect.

256
00:11:05,448 --> 00:11:07,214
Okay, last stitch.

257
00:11:09,452 --> 00:11:11,518
Can I have the dressing, please?

258
00:11:12,239 --> 00:11:14,138
Pretty snappy, huh?

259
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:15,873
Hmm?

260
00:11:15,942 --> 00:11:17,458
It goes fast,

261
00:11:17,527 --> 00:11:18,893
like magic.

262
00:11:20,297 --> 00:11:21,829
Magic.

263
00:11:21,898 --> 00:11:23,280
Okay, can I have the chart?

264
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,400
Is there a problem?

265
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:43,646
Not that I'm aware of.

266
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:46,086
Because I'm doing
my best to be pleasant,

267
00:11:46,156 --> 00:11:48,806
but I don't owe you an
explanation for the fact

268
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,825
that I happen to be...

269
00:11:50,893 --> 00:11:53,272
Sleeping with a nurse, I
believe, is what you're looking for.

270
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:55,396
You and I broke up.

271
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:57,510
You basically told
me to wait for you.

272
00:11:57,534 --> 00:11:59,000
What? I did no such thing.

273
00:11:59,068 --> 00:12:00,885
No, but you did.

274
00:12:00,953 --> 00:12:02,436
You said it was too much.

275
00:12:02,505 --> 00:12:04,016
Something horrible
had just happened,

276
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,702
you were traumatized, you
couldn't handle a relationship.

277
00:12:05,726 --> 00:12:07,491
It wasn't me. It was you.

278
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,444
Okay, now that is not fair

279
00:12:09,512 --> 00:12:12,714
and, look, I still can't
handle a relationship,

280
00:12:12,782 --> 00:12:16,784
the kind of thing that you
and I were considering...

281
00:12:16,852 --> 00:12:19,604
What I'm doing right
now is nothing like that.

282
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:20,832
Then what is it?

283
00:12:24,511 --> 00:12:27,428
If you have a problem working
with me, take it up with Pierre.

284
00:12:38,358 --> 00:12:39,790
Excellent.

285
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:41,525
Very fine work, Doctor...

286
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,061
Grey.

287
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:44,695
As in Lexie Grey?

288
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,664
Oh, she's my sister.

289
00:12:46,732 --> 00:12:47,798
Oh.

290
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,591
Come on. Not now.

291
00:13:03,633 --> 00:13:04,832
I gotta...

292
00:13:04,901 --> 00:13:06,233
I'm out.

293
00:13:06,302 --> 00:13:07,835
Hey, he forfeits, right?

294
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:10,004
He walked out.

295
00:13:10,073 --> 00:13:11,856
Congratulations.
We have our winners.

296
00:13:13,026 --> 00:13:14,303
He's your son, and
you're the judge.

297
00:13:14,327 --> 00:13:15,555
Isn't there some
rule against that?

298
00:13:15,579 --> 00:13:16,889
I don't play favorites, dear.

299
00:13:16,913 --> 00:13:18,162
Nepotism is for the weak.

300
00:13:18,231 --> 00:13:21,282
That's what my birthday
cards always said.

301
00:13:21,351 --> 00:13:22,928
What the hell
happened? I don't know.

302
00:13:22,952 --> 00:13:23,996
Does anybody else
know about this?

303
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:25,219
I don't think so.

304
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:28,590
She had a seizure.

305
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,891
Now it's gonna be
big, right? Chad.

306
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:38,627
What? I'm just sayin', maybe
you could be trading up, you know?

307
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:39,767
Have you seen it?

308
00:13:39,836 --> 00:13:41,302
The donor organ? Yes.

309
00:13:41,371 --> 00:13:43,265
How's it measure up? It's
nothing to be embarrassed about?

310
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:44,400
Chad, shut up.

311
00:13:44,424 --> 00:13:45,456
I'm just sayin',

312
00:13:45,525 --> 00:13:47,169
my little brother's
a good-lookin' kid.

313
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:48,273
He's gonna need...

314
00:13:48,311 --> 00:13:49,677
He's gonna be happy with it.

315
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:51,423
And it's gonna work?
Not just the plumbing,

316
00:13:51,447 --> 00:13:53,180
it'll stand up and
report for duty?

317
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:54,476
Chad, I swear to God.

318
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,578
That's the point of
doing a transplant,

319
00:13:56,602 --> 00:13:59,615
to hopefully restore full
urinary and sexual function.

320
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:02,740
If you're worried, there's
always penile reconstruction.

321
00:14:02,809 --> 00:14:04,024
It's less risky.

322
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:06,894
I saw the signs for months
before I saw a doctor.

323
00:14:06,963 --> 00:14:09,775
By the time I finally saw
someone, they tell me it's cancer,

324
00:14:09,799 --> 00:14:11,843
it's too far gone,
and I have to lose it.

325
00:14:11,867 --> 00:14:13,845
I'm tired of, every
time I look down,

326
00:14:13,869 --> 00:14:15,731
being reminded of
what a coward I am.

327
00:14:15,755 --> 00:14:17,171
This feels like a second chance,

328
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,480
and like she says, if you
can learn something from me

329
00:14:19,542 --> 00:14:20,853
that might help
out the next guy,

330
00:14:20,877 --> 00:14:23,544
then I can feel pretty
good about that, too.

331
00:14:26,499 --> 00:14:27,632
Okay.

332
00:14:29,152 --> 00:14:30,518
See you in surgery.

333
00:14:33,222 --> 00:14:34,333
Temp's 103.

334
00:14:34,357 --> 00:14:35,901
Abdomen's tender and distended.

335
00:14:35,925 --> 00:14:37,920
Her foster mother said
Zola was running a fever.

336
00:14:37,944 --> 00:14:39,772
She's been crying all day.
They couldn't get her to stop.

337
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:41,562
High-pitched bowel
sounds. Call CT.

338
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:43,480
Yeah, and I'm gonna
page Grey and Shepherd.

339
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:44,598
You can't do that.

340
00:14:44,667 --> 00:14:46,183
What? The kid's sick.

341
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:48,002
Their custody was suspended.

342
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:50,655
I know they're your
friends, but at this moment,

343
00:14:50,707 --> 00:14:51,951
they're nothing more
than a third party.

344
00:14:51,975 --> 00:14:53,085
It's a breach of
confidentiality.

345
00:14:53,109 --> 00:14:54,186
They're right here.

346
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:56,094
Their custody is
under investigation.

347
00:14:56,162 --> 00:14:58,402
The last thing any of us
needs is a breach of protocol.

348
00:14:58,464 --> 00:15:00,081
It could jeopardize
the adoption.

349
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:02,249
Okay, okay, little
miss munchkin.

350
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:04,038
You're gonna feel
a little bit of a sting,

351
00:15:04,086 --> 00:15:06,187
and then I'm gonna be all done.

352
00:15:06,256 --> 00:15:08,467
Very impressive in
the skills lab, Meredith.

353
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:10,411
What are you specializing in?

354
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:13,510
Oh. Um, I was
thinking about neuro,

355
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:14,846
but I'm making a change.

356
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:17,098
Jackson had a
chance to be on neuro,

357
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,833
but he turned it down
to follow me into plastics.

358
00:15:21,871 --> 00:15:24,539
You had an opportunity to
work with Derek Shepherd

359
00:15:24,607 --> 00:15:26,273
and you turned it down

360
00:15:26,343 --> 00:15:27,742
for plastics?

361
00:15:27,827 --> 00:15:29,254
Jackson Avery, who raised
you when I wasn't looking?

362
00:15:29,278 --> 00:15:30,311
Mom, let's not...

363
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:31,440
I'm standing right here.

364
00:15:31,464 --> 00:15:33,665
I know, honey, but
this isn't about you.

365
00:15:33,717 --> 00:15:36,083
This is about
this boy and... Oh!

366
00:15:36,169 --> 00:15:38,436
And here he is,
the man of the hour.

367
00:15:39,506 --> 00:15:42,656
Chad, honey, this is
as far as you can go.

368
00:15:42,725 --> 00:15:44,058
Buddy, as soon as this is over,

369
00:15:44,126 --> 00:15:45,437
I'm gonna take you
to test drive that thing

370
00:15:45,461 --> 00:15:46,722
in every strip club
on Long Island.

371
00:15:46,746 --> 00:15:48,245
Chad, stop.

372
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:50,692
For the past year, all
we've talked about is this.

373
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:52,311
I miss talking about the Knicks.

374
00:15:52,335 --> 00:15:54,279
Tell me this is gonna work
so I can have my brother back.

375
00:15:54,303 --> 00:15:55,653
It's gonna work.

376
00:15:55,722 --> 00:15:57,616
I'm gonna go harvest
the organ right now.

377
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,273
I'll see you in the OR.

378
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:04,245
When this is over, you can
never mention my penis again.

379
00:16:04,314 --> 00:16:05,412
Promise.

380
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:12,069
All right.

381
00:16:12,121 --> 00:16:13,520
Bye, buddy.

382
00:16:22,248 --> 00:16:23,731
Freakin' hell.

383
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:30,137
That's a pretty nasty
bowel obstruction.

384
00:16:30,205 --> 00:16:31,300
Are you on your own with that?

385
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:32,623
No. Uh, Robbins.

386
00:16:32,692 --> 00:16:33,932
Good.

387
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:41,293
Thank you so much for
letting me help you with this.

388
00:16:41,317 --> 00:16:44,117
I mean, how often do
you get to harvest a penis?

389
00:16:44,186 --> 00:16:47,054
Well, I thought it would
give us a chance to catch up.

390
00:16:47,123 --> 00:16:48,156
Take this, dear.

391
00:16:48,224 --> 00:16:50,291
Okay, here we go...

392
00:16:50,359 --> 00:16:53,110
Like millions of angry
wives have dreamed of.

393
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:57,081
Except we'll start with an
artistic, elliptical incision.

394
00:16:58,201 --> 00:16:59,766
So how's it going, honey?

395
00:16:59,835 --> 00:17:01,514
Oh, you know, it's fifth year,

396
00:17:01,538 --> 00:17:03,916
and chief resident
is like 20 jobs in one,

397
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,918
and on top of that, I've
got boards coming up

398
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:07,325
and surgeries to log,

399
00:17:07,393 --> 00:17:09,560
so much to get done.

400
00:17:09,629 --> 00:17:12,447
So when are you going
to have sex with a man?

401
00:17:12,515 --> 00:17:14,498
When are you
gonna get that done?

402
00:17:15,151 --> 00:17:16,500
Hmm?

403
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:18,798
I'm... I'm sorry. What?

404
00:17:18,822 --> 00:17:22,506
Look, I don't know or care
why you're waiting, dear.

405
00:17:22,575 --> 00:17:25,142
But unless you have a
good reason, I say do it.

406
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:27,178
You're all wound up.

407
00:17:27,247 --> 00:17:29,363
It'll get you unwound.

408
00:17:29,431 --> 00:17:30,991
It'll make you a better surgeon.

409
00:17:32,201 --> 00:17:34,285
Oh, that's a nice dorsal vein.

410
00:17:34,337 --> 00:17:36,137
Yeah. Easy to graft.

411
00:17:38,091 --> 00:17:40,169
Is it really that obvious?

412
00:17:40,193 --> 00:17:42,876
You keep looking at this
thing like it's gonna bite you.

413
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:45,245
I...

414
00:17:53,973 --> 00:17:55,213
Catherine Avery.

415
00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:57,591
Richard Webber. Oh!

416
00:17:59,629 --> 00:18:01,362
Shame on you.

417
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:04,798
I send you my son to educate, and
you let him wander off into plastics.

418
00:18:04,868 --> 00:18:06,108
Well, he seems happy.

419
00:18:06,152 --> 00:18:08,252
Happiness is for
ordinary people.

420
00:18:08,321 --> 00:18:11,188
He's my son.
Greatness is his legacy.

421
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:13,252
At a certain point,
you have to realize

422
00:18:13,276 --> 00:18:15,487
that you've done
everything you can.

423
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:17,939
You can't force people to do
things they don't want to do.

424
00:18:17,963 --> 00:18:19,497
Don't I know it.

425
00:18:19,565 --> 00:18:23,000
When was it that we met
at that convention in Miami,

426
00:18:23,069 --> 00:18:25,486
and I just flirted with
you shamelessly,

427
00:18:25,554 --> 00:18:27,354
and you had to tell
me you were married?

428
00:18:27,423 --> 00:18:28,503
I remember.

429
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:30,107
Are you still married?

430
00:18:30,176 --> 00:18:33,294
'Cause after this surgery tonight,
I'm gonna need some dinner.

431
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:36,664
I'm still married. Damn it.

432
00:18:38,267 --> 00:18:40,012
Well, there's always
next time. Yeah.

433
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:41,451
You know I don't give up.

434
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:44,028
Have a good surgery.

435
00:18:44,073 --> 00:18:45,106
Thanks, Richard.

436
00:18:45,174 --> 00:18:46,707
You're welcome.

437
00:18:56,269 --> 00:18:58,585
What? I was about to do
an art line with my left hand.

438
00:18:58,654 --> 00:19:01,049
Zola's got a bowel
obstruction. We have to operate.

439
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:02,289
What? Where's Mer?

440
00:19:02,358 --> 00:19:03,836
She can't know.
Neither can Derek.

441
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:06,610
I mean, they get involved,
and social services flips out,

442
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:07,790
the adoption's shot.

443
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:10,064
Well, is she stable?
For the moment.

444
00:19:10,133 --> 00:19:12,527
And that's the right call,
right? We don't tell 'em.

445
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:13,867
You just told me it was.

446
00:19:13,937 --> 00:19:15,185
But I'm right. Right?

447
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:17,065
It'll blow the adoption?
Yeah, we can't tell them.

448
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:19,370
Okay. All right.
That's your decision.

449
00:19:20,843 --> 00:19:22,309
Hey, you just
called me down here

450
00:19:22,378 --> 00:19:24,356
so I could take responsibility
for your decision?

451
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:25,679
How small are your balls?

452
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:27,058
Meredith didn't
talk to me for weeks

453
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:28,327
because I screwed up her life.

454
00:19:28,351 --> 00:19:30,551
The balls are pretty
small right now.

455
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:32,786
Dr. Karev. The
baby's seizing again.

456
00:19:33,456 --> 00:19:34,888
Page Robbins!

457
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:37,040
We're tellin' Mer!

458
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:38,625
You bet your ass, we are.

459
00:19:41,113 --> 00:19:42,858
All right, my dears.

460
00:19:42,882 --> 00:19:44,592
What do you say we
get to anastomosing

461
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:46,099
these deep dorsal vessels?

462
00:19:46,186 --> 00:19:47,885
Suction.

463
00:19:47,954 --> 00:19:49,665
Dr. Grey, easy on
the suction, hon.

464
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:50,805
Lighter touch.

465
00:19:50,873 --> 00:19:52,073
Like that?

466
00:19:52,141 --> 00:19:53,340
That's perfect.

467
00:19:53,409 --> 00:19:55,692
Dr. Grey, seems you've inherited

468
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:57,339
the hands of your
mother. Thank you.

469
00:19:57,363 --> 00:19:59,863
Did your sister Lexie
inherit the same skills?

470
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:01,198
Dr. Avery.

471
00:20:01,267 --> 00:20:02,467
I'm my mother's only child.

472
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:04,552
Lexie and I are half sisters.

473
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,415
Sounds like someone
picked the wrong Grey.

474
00:20:06,439 --> 00:20:07,654
Ma...

475
00:20:07,723 --> 00:20:09,368
Lexie is very
talented. She's brilliant.

476
00:20:09,392 --> 00:20:11,570
Lexie's great. Great
surgeon, great girl.

477
00:20:11,594 --> 00:20:12,938
Sorry. Excuse me. Sorry.

478
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:14,729
What is all the
bustling, please?

479
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:17,832
I'm sorry to interrupt. I
need to speak with Dr. Grey.

480
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:20,467
Dr. Grey is busy
making history right now.

481
00:20:20,536 --> 00:20:21,902
Suction, please.

482
00:20:21,971 --> 00:20:23,237
Meredith.

483
00:20:25,308 --> 00:20:26,573
Meredith.

484
00:20:33,783 --> 00:20:36,267
I... I'm sorry,
Dr. Avery. I'm sorry.

485
00:20:36,335 --> 00:20:38,268
For the love of God.

486
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:41,055
Ellis Grey is rolling
in her grave right now.

487
00:20:41,123 --> 00:20:43,224
Who wants to take
Dr. Grey's place?

488
00:20:46,646 --> 00:20:48,762
Dr. Kepner. Yes!

489
00:20:48,831 --> 00:20:51,832
Excuse me. Excuse
me! I have to scrub.

490
00:20:51,918 --> 00:20:53,996
We're just doing a
standard workup today,

491
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:56,920
and if your blood's
clean, you're a free man.

492
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:58,651
Do I have to wait for the
labs or can you call me?

493
00:20:58,675 --> 00:21:00,001
We'll call you. Good,

494
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:01,553
because I'm marinating
the fish for tonight,

495
00:21:01,577 --> 00:21:04,697
and if it stays in that thing for
too long, it just turns into mush.

496
00:21:05,515 --> 00:21:06,914
What? You don't like fish?

497
00:21:06,983 --> 00:21:08,182
I do.

498
00:21:08,251 --> 00:21:09,349
You don't like fish?

499
00:21:09,418 --> 00:21:10,534
I like fish.

500
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:12,002
Good. Okay, wow.

501
00:21:12,071 --> 00:21:13,382
I probably should've
checked earlier,

502
00:21:13,406 --> 00:21:15,806
but I'm new to this whole
dinner party thing, so...

503
00:21:22,464 --> 00:21:23,704
What's happening right now?

504
00:21:23,766 --> 00:21:26,266
Henry and Teddy are
having a dinner party tonight.

505
00:21:26,335 --> 00:21:28,169
So I gather. Yeah,
and we're invited.

506
00:21:28,237 --> 00:21:29,670
Yeah, I got that, too.

507
00:21:29,739 --> 00:21:30,938
Is there a problem?

508
00:21:31,007 --> 00:21:32,956
I forgot to tell him.

509
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:35,320
It's a good thing Henry came
by and brought up the marinade.

510
00:21:35,344 --> 00:21:37,022
That's not a very
masculine topic, marinade.

511
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:38,139
I should've cooked beef.

512
00:21:38,163 --> 00:21:39,557
Are you free? I am.

513
00:21:39,581 --> 00:21:41,610
I mean, 'cause, you know,
you don't have to come.

514
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:43,734
Wow. Best invite ever.

515
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:45,051
I'm...

516
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,788
Okay. This is my, um, bad.

517
00:21:47,857 --> 00:21:48,951
It could be my bad. I mean...

518
00:21:48,975 --> 00:21:49,975
Yeah.

519
00:21:50,026 --> 00:21:51,241
You both suck.

520
00:21:53,012 --> 00:21:54,244
See you at dinner.

521
00:21:56,132 --> 00:21:58,332
Dr. Avery, thank you so
much for bringing me in.

522
00:21:58,401 --> 00:21:59,633
This is so exciting.

523
00:21:59,702 --> 00:22:02,068
Uh-huh. Relax, honey, relax.

524
00:22:02,137 --> 00:22:03,771
Suction, please.

525
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,505
Lightly. Lightly.

526
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:08,286
And that, ladies and gentlemen,

527
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:11,028
completes the work
on this dorsal artery.

528
00:22:11,096 --> 00:22:13,313
Everybody, stretch,
shake out your hands,

529
00:22:13,382 --> 00:22:15,466
take a breather.

530
00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:17,584
Your technique
has improved, baby.

531
00:22:17,653 --> 00:22:19,686
Thanks.

532
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:21,767
It's easy to teach when there's
natural ability to work with.

533
00:22:21,791 --> 00:22:23,257
Your boy's born for plastics.

534
00:22:23,325 --> 00:22:25,960
That might be so, but, you know,

535
00:22:26,028 --> 00:22:28,395
you gotta be careful
with that easy road.

536
00:22:28,464 --> 00:22:30,814
A person can get used
to taking the easy road,

537
00:22:30,883 --> 00:22:33,067
and next thing they
know, they find themselves

538
00:22:33,136 --> 00:22:35,703
the boob-job king of Seattle,

539
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:37,421
a tummy-tuck tycoon.

540
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:38,667
I don't think that's fair.

541
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:40,357
More irrigation and suction.

542
00:22:40,426 --> 00:22:43,727
Are you saying there isn't easy
money in plastics, Dr. Sloan?

543
00:22:43,795 --> 00:22:45,774
Are you saying there's no
valuable work to be done there?

544
00:22:45,798 --> 00:22:48,060
She's saying I don't have the
discipline to resist the easy money.

545
00:22:48,084 --> 00:22:50,701
I'm just saying, there's a
temptation. Gently, April.

546
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:52,480
Yeah, well, maybe if you
knew a little more about me,

547
00:22:52,504 --> 00:22:54,132
you'd know that I'm
incredibly disciplined.

548
00:22:54,156 --> 00:22:55,917
And I'm not a tummy-tuck tycoon.

549
00:22:55,941 --> 00:22:57,202
I'm sorry about that, Dr. Sloan.

550
00:22:57,226 --> 00:22:58,871
She's obviously...
Don't apologize for me.

551
00:22:58,895 --> 00:23:00,505
Yeah, well, somebody
needs to... Suction, April...

552
00:23:00,529 --> 00:23:01,829
Right near the dorsal vein.

553
00:23:01,897 --> 00:23:03,358
- I chose plastics.
- Right here?

554
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:04,809
I pursued Dr. Sloan.
These are my choices.

555
00:23:04,833 --> 00:23:06,445
I'm not gonna sit here
and let you trash them

556
00:23:06,469 --> 00:23:07,730
because they're not the same
choices you would've made.

557
00:23:07,754 --> 00:23:08,780
Back off. You back off.

558
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:10,044
Not you, the suction. April.

559
00:23:10,106 --> 00:23:11,438
Oh, God. The vein is stuck.

560
00:23:11,507 --> 00:23:12,640
What do I do?

561
00:23:12,708 --> 00:23:13,952
All right, shut off
the suction now!

562
00:23:13,976 --> 00:23:15,387
Don't move. It's shredding.
She's mangling it.

563
00:23:15,411 --> 00:23:16,694
Oh, my God. It's not stopping.

564
00:23:17,697 --> 00:23:18,962
Oh, no.

565
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,999
Oh, God.

566
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:24,234
What did I do?

567
00:23:24,303 --> 00:23:26,303
You destroyed my dorsal vein.

568
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:30,035
Is it her shunt? Is
it hydrocephalus?

569
00:23:30,059 --> 00:23:31,136
What the hell were you thinking?

570
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,770
That was her CT
before, wasn't it?

571
00:23:32,794 --> 00:23:34,473
I'm sorry. I couldn't
tell you. You still can't.

572
00:23:34,497 --> 00:23:36,446
The hell he can't.
She's my patient.

573
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:37,859
Oh, thank God. Owen, I...

574
00:23:37,883 --> 00:23:39,928
Look, Robbins told
me what is going on,

575
00:23:39,952 --> 00:23:41,797
and she is right.
You can't see Zola.

576
00:23:41,821 --> 00:23:43,086
Owen, stay out of it.

577
00:23:43,155 --> 00:23:44,338
She's probably terrified.

578
00:23:44,407 --> 00:23:45,984
She's sedated. She's not alone.

579
00:23:46,008 --> 00:23:48,086
I have a herd of nurses
on a rotating schedule,

580
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:49,838
holding her, singing
her... We've got this.

581
00:23:49,862 --> 00:23:51,211
Did you try an NG tube?

582
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,657
The bowels are
compressing the VP shunt,

583
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:53,992
and she's hypotensive, so
we're taking her to the OR.

584
00:23:54,016 --> 00:23:55,677
Well, then I'm in there.
Shepherd, you can't.

585
00:23:55,701 --> 00:23:57,495
I inserted the shunt. It's part
of the problem. I should fix it!

586
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:58,952
Are you out of your mind?

587
00:23:59,021 --> 00:24:00,915
The adoption lady's
watching her like a hawk.

588
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:02,117
They're looking for a reason
to ding... Where is she?

589
00:24:02,141 --> 00:24:03,585
I will page you the
minute that we're done.

590
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:04,686
I'll have Karev
give you hourlies...

591
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:05,910
Karev, look at me.

592
00:24:08,146 --> 00:24:09,596
Where is she?

593
00:24:13,402 --> 00:24:14,834
Pre-op. 1608.

594
00:24:14,903 --> 00:24:16,849
Thank you. I'm going there. No.

595
00:24:16,873 --> 00:24:18,471
Shepherd, don't.

596
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,152
Derek. Derek, don't
do this. Back off, Hunt.

597
00:24:20,176 --> 00:24:21,820
You know how long the
shunt... Derek. Shepherd...

598
00:24:21,844 --> 00:24:23,155
Had to have been
malfunctioning... You are making...

599
00:24:23,179 --> 00:24:24,723
For her bowels to
have gotten this bad?

600
00:24:24,747 --> 00:24:26,457
They didn't know
what to look for.

601
00:24:26,481 --> 00:24:28,126
Exactly, because she
should've been with us.

602
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:29,894
And she's not,
and that's my fault.

603
00:24:29,918 --> 00:24:32,280
And I may never sleep another
night again because of that,

604
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:34,232
but if there's a prayer
of us getting her back,

605
00:24:34,256 --> 00:24:36,423
we have to just dot
our I's and cross our T's,

606
00:24:36,492 --> 00:24:37,791
not mess with the rules.

607
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:39,470
Arizona is a great surgeon.

608
00:24:39,494 --> 00:24:40,961
Please don't make it worse.

609
00:24:41,997 --> 00:24:43,897
What is your
plan on fixing this?

610
00:24:43,966 --> 00:24:45,232
It's just kinked.

611
00:24:45,301 --> 00:24:47,145
Once I get in there, and
I remove the adhesions

612
00:24:47,169 --> 00:24:49,465
and I fix the obstruction,
the shunt will be fine.

613
00:24:49,489 --> 00:24:52,017
What if it's not? What if
it's disconnected or broken?

614
00:24:52,041 --> 00:24:53,702
Then I convert to a VA shunt.

615
00:24:53,726 --> 00:24:55,175
Derek, I can do this.

616
00:24:55,244 --> 00:24:56,776
Let me do this.

617
00:25:04,971 --> 00:25:07,411
I just left OR 2.
They've started.

618
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:09,740
Thanks.

619
00:25:15,781 --> 00:25:18,215
I know I should
be with Meredith.

620
00:25:18,283 --> 00:25:21,051
I see her pain, but I can't.
I can barely look at her.

621
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:23,137
This is all her fault.

622
00:25:23,205 --> 00:25:26,307
Every time I think I've moved
on, I've started to forgive her,

623
00:25:26,375 --> 00:25:29,375
something else comes up,
and I'm right back where I was.

624
00:25:30,012 --> 00:25:31,779
You know, Cristina
and I, we just...

625
00:25:31,847 --> 00:25:33,547
We just went through something,

626
00:25:33,616 --> 00:25:35,048
and I know how you feel.

627
00:25:36,218 --> 00:25:37,718
It's not easy.

628
00:25:37,787 --> 00:25:39,920
You know, they
don't make it easy.

629
00:25:41,356 --> 00:25:42,389
No.

630
00:25:49,999 --> 00:25:52,599
Did you hear that Zola
came to the hospital,

631
00:25:52,668 --> 00:25:53,968
had a bowel obstruction?

632
00:25:54,036 --> 00:25:55,102
Yep.

633
00:25:56,472 --> 00:25:59,106
Can't be easy on Meredith.

634
00:25:59,175 --> 00:26:00,974
Can't be easy at all.

635
00:26:02,244 --> 00:26:04,010
You are not

636
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:06,347
really using
Meredith's sick baby

637
00:26:06,415 --> 00:26:08,348
to guilt me into
putting her on my trial.

638
00:26:08,417 --> 00:26:11,413
Well, if you think she lacks
judgment, then help her.

639
00:26:11,437 --> 00:26:13,314
You're the moral
compass of this hospital.

640
00:26:14,556 --> 00:26:15,855
You don't...

641
00:26:15,924 --> 00:26:18,508
I'm the moral
compass of nothing.

642
00:26:18,578 --> 00:26:22,713
I am using one
man like a plaything

643
00:26:22,782 --> 00:26:25,215
and had another one
bribing a scheduler.

644
00:26:25,283 --> 00:26:27,095
Yeah, I really don't
want to know about...

645
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:29,620
Like a plaything.

646
00:26:30,489 --> 00:26:31,872
Often.

647
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:34,174
And enthusiastically.

648
00:26:36,712 --> 00:26:39,513
Maybe you should stop.

649
00:26:39,581 --> 00:26:42,866
Did I mention that I
promised Ellis Grey

650
00:26:43,952 --> 00:26:45,519
on her deathbed

651
00:26:46,455 --> 00:26:47,999
that I would take
care of Meredith?

652
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:50,224
I am still not putting
that girl on my trial.

653
00:26:55,264 --> 00:26:56,964
I am so sorry, Dr. Avery.

654
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:58,465
You gave me one job, suction.

655
00:26:58,534 --> 00:26:59,854
I mean, what kind of a person...

656
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:02,486
Dr. Kepner, stop talking, now.

657
00:27:05,107 --> 00:27:07,107
Okay, new game plan.

658
00:27:07,176 --> 00:27:08,820
We harvest the
saphenous vein from his leg

659
00:27:08,844 --> 00:27:10,254
and use it as extension tubing.

660
00:27:10,278 --> 00:27:13,313
If we used a deep inferior
epigastric perforator flap,

661
00:27:13,382 --> 00:27:15,010
we wouldn't need
to cut into his leg.

662
00:27:15,034 --> 00:27:16,812
I'm not familiar
with that technique.

663
00:27:16,836 --> 00:27:19,398
It's been used recently in
genital reconstruction surgeries.

664
00:27:19,422 --> 00:27:21,566
I've seen him do it. The
results have been amazing.

665
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:23,385
More natural
looking, ages better,

666
00:27:23,409 --> 00:27:25,542
there'd be no visible scarring,

667
00:27:25,611 --> 00:27:27,723
less post-op pain, fewer
post-op complications.

668
00:27:27,747 --> 00:27:28,828
You want me to go on?

669
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:30,881
I'm not gonna risk
Ryan's penile function

670
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:32,199
because I bruised your ego.

671
00:27:32,268 --> 00:27:34,296
I'm not trying to impress you.

672
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,320
Let me do this, and
that'll come naturally.

673
00:27:38,974 --> 00:27:40,473
Come on, Dr. Avery.

674
00:27:40,542 --> 00:27:42,622
Step into the future with me.

675
00:27:45,981 --> 00:27:48,699
Well, if you feel
comfortable doing it...

676
00:27:48,751 --> 00:27:50,745
Hell, I feel comfortable
letting your kid do it.

677
00:27:50,769 --> 00:27:52,169
Avery, prep the abdomen.

678
00:27:52,238 --> 00:27:53,238
I'm on it.

679
00:27:54,689 --> 00:27:56,189
So Alex was
supposed to call by now.

680
00:27:56,258 --> 00:27:58,691
Yeah. In, like, 10 minutes.

681
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,000
Do you think it's bad
if we call him? Yep.

682
00:28:03,282 --> 00:28:04,314
What if she...

683
00:28:04,383 --> 00:28:06,503
She's not gonna
die. Do you hear me?

684
00:28:10,806 --> 00:28:12,238
All right.

685
00:28:12,308 --> 00:28:15,303
Do you know how to do
single-handed left-handed ties?

686
00:28:15,327 --> 00:28:16,760
No. Try it.

687
00:28:22,901 --> 00:28:24,584
Like that?

688
00:28:24,653 --> 00:28:26,264
Did you just do
that on your first try?

689
00:28:26,288 --> 00:28:28,366
Yeah. Well, you are
holding your string too tight...

690
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:29,439
Shut up.

691
00:28:29,508 --> 00:28:31,008
Got a message from Karev.

692
00:28:31,077 --> 00:28:32,804
They had to resect a
small part of the bowel,

693
00:28:32,828 --> 00:28:34,856
but everything else
looks good so far.

694
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,880
Oh, thank God.

695
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:37,030
Yeah.

696
00:28:48,627 --> 00:28:50,010
Did you...

697
00:28:51,046 --> 00:28:53,330
Oh, I hate you people.

698
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:55,782
Don't touch it.

699
00:28:55,851 --> 00:28:57,684
You know, I really
don't get you.

700
00:28:57,753 --> 00:28:59,552
You should understand
better than anyone.

701
00:28:59,621 --> 00:29:01,105
What if it was Sofia?

702
00:29:01,173 --> 00:29:03,156
Do you have any parental rights?

703
00:29:03,225 --> 00:29:05,976
If something happens to her,
Sloan and Torres aren't around,

704
00:29:06,045 --> 00:29:09,212
you got some peds doc saying
you don't have a right to see her.

705
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:13,182
Mind your own business, Karev.

706
00:29:14,386 --> 00:29:15,630
I'm sorry. I'm just
sayin' it sucks.

707
00:29:15,654 --> 00:29:17,454
No, here's what sucks.

708
00:29:17,522 --> 00:29:19,083
Zola's gonna be fine because
we're awesome surgeons,

709
00:29:19,107 --> 00:29:20,936
and if Meredith and Derek
didn't know that she was here,

710
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,921
Zola would still be fine, the
adoption wouldn't be in jeopardy,

711
00:29:22,945 --> 00:29:24,239
and they wouldn't be
in a room somewhere

712
00:29:24,263 --> 00:29:26,703
going out their minds
imagining the worst.

713
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:33,331
All right. Good
anastomosis, Dr. Avery.

714
00:29:33,355 --> 00:29:34,621
Perfect flap.

715
00:29:34,689 --> 00:29:36,023
Thank you.

716
00:29:36,091 --> 00:29:37,808
And Mrs. Dr. Avery,

717
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:40,343
here is your
brand-new dorsal vein.

718
00:29:40,412 --> 00:29:41,452
Impressive, no?

719
00:29:41,513 --> 00:29:42,996
If it actually works.

720
00:29:43,064 --> 00:29:45,048
I mean, right now
all we've got is a sad

721
00:29:45,117 --> 00:29:47,767
old gray penis with
a piece of belly in it.

722
00:29:47,836 --> 00:29:49,513
Dr. Kepner, release the clamp.

723
00:29:49,537 --> 00:29:50,837
Uh, maybe you should do it...

724
00:29:50,906 --> 00:29:52,289
Shh! Girl, get in there.

725
00:29:59,731 --> 00:30:01,748
Yep, pinker.

726
00:30:01,817 --> 00:30:02,950
Oh, that is pinker.

727
00:30:03,018 --> 00:30:05,247
Well, I don't know about you.

728
00:30:05,271 --> 00:30:08,791
But I'd say that's just about
the pinkest penis I've ever seen.

729
00:30:10,459 --> 00:30:11,541
Yep.

730
00:30:20,269 --> 00:30:23,203
We were able to remove
all of the adhesions

731
00:30:23,272 --> 00:30:25,388
and get the shunt working again.

732
00:30:25,457 --> 00:30:26,907
We'll monitor her
while she's here.

733
00:30:26,976 --> 00:30:28,741
She's gonna be fine.

734
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:46,092
I'll stay with Zola tonight.

735
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:48,406
Okay. I will call

736
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:50,897
if there's anything
to worry about.

737
00:30:50,966 --> 00:30:53,450
So don't call
every five minutes.

738
00:30:56,989 --> 00:30:58,237
You guys go home.

739
00:30:58,307 --> 00:30:59,539
Okay.

740
00:31:10,885 --> 00:31:11,951
Hey.

741
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:13,786
Do I have to set
a place for Eli?

742
00:31:13,855 --> 00:31:16,756
Because I hear that
you forgot to invite him.

743
00:31:16,825 --> 00:31:20,226
Why do people forget to
invite people to dinner parties?

744
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:22,045
Is that a trick question?

745
00:31:22,114 --> 00:31:23,363
I need to break up with him.

746
00:31:23,432 --> 00:31:25,431
Oh. Oh, oh, please
don't do it at my party.

747
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,361
See, the last time I
broke up with a man,

748
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:29,419
he thought I was
asking him to wait for me,

749
00:31:29,487 --> 00:31:31,521
and then he did, apparently,

750
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:33,835
and he bought lattes
for a man named Pierre.

751
00:31:33,859 --> 00:31:36,193
Is that slang for something
that I don't know about?

752
00:31:36,261 --> 00:31:38,995
See, I try to preserve
the dignity of others,

753
00:31:39,064 --> 00:31:40,913
and that's the problem.

754
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:42,794
And I'm poetic, which, you know,

755
00:31:42,818 --> 00:31:44,562
I like to think
provides clarity,

756
00:31:44,586 --> 00:31:47,187
but in fact may simply
cloud the message.

757
00:31:47,255 --> 00:31:49,589
All right. Here's what I do.

758
00:31:49,658 --> 00:31:52,192
Use short,
declarative sentences.

759
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:56,363
I'm ending this. All
the best to you. Got it?

760
00:31:56,431 --> 00:31:58,576
Oh, and do it before the party.

761
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,967
No. Not before.

762
00:32:01,035 --> 00:32:03,336
Uh. Tomorrow. Before is rude.

763
00:32:03,405 --> 00:32:06,539
Before is depriving the man of a
meal, which he's now excited about

764
00:32:06,608 --> 00:32:08,875
because your husband
couldn't shut up about the sauce.

765
00:32:08,943 --> 00:32:11,039
I have to serve dinner
to a dead man walking?

766
00:32:11,063 --> 00:32:13,179
Oh, buck up. You can handle it.

767
00:32:13,248 --> 00:32:14,328
I...

768
00:32:55,573 --> 00:32:57,273
I just need a second.

769
00:32:57,342 --> 00:32:58,991
Take all the time you need.

770
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:01,278
It's like Christmas
friggin' morning, dude.

771
00:33:03,198 --> 00:33:04,731
I will shut up.

772
00:33:08,153 --> 00:33:10,102
Okay. I'm ready.

773
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:17,593
There's quite a bit of
swelling, but that will go down.

774
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:19,582
And it'll do everything
it's supposed to.

775
00:33:24,286 --> 00:33:25,652
It's great.

776
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:27,770
Thank you.

777
00:33:29,224 --> 00:33:31,741
You want to see? I'll
give you one last look.

778
00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:34,260
I'm good, bro. I'm
happy if you're happy.

779
00:33:39,885 --> 00:33:41,535
Well, that is great.

780
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:43,470
Clean wound.

781
00:33:43,539 --> 00:33:44,832
You'll have a scar,
but who cares?

782
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:47,357
It'll make you look fierce.

783
00:33:47,426 --> 00:33:49,270
Hey, you know, you
should go to the party.

784
00:33:49,294 --> 00:33:50,410
Oh, I have to finish this.

785
00:33:50,478 --> 00:33:53,446
Plus, I thought I'd
keep you company.

786
00:33:53,515 --> 00:33:55,292
You know, I've been
practicing this all day.

787
00:33:55,316 --> 00:33:58,435
And your parents, they can do
single-handed left-handed ties

788
00:33:58,503 --> 00:34:01,743
with their eyes closed, never
mind closing a tube of cream.

789
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:03,923
Your dad

790
00:34:03,992 --> 00:34:06,176
is a rock star. He is
a household name.

791
00:34:06,244 --> 00:34:08,894
And your mom? She's a natural.

792
00:34:08,963 --> 00:34:10,674
People say that she
got it from her mom.

793
00:34:10,698 --> 00:34:12,382
So you're gonna get it, too.

794
00:34:12,451 --> 00:34:15,185
You'll watch her resect
tumors all the time,

795
00:34:15,254 --> 00:34:17,620
and when you slice
open your first abdomen,

796
00:34:17,689 --> 00:34:19,939
people will say,
"Oh, my goodness.

797
00:34:20,008 --> 00:34:21,953
"How did she learn
that so fast, huh?

798
00:34:21,977 --> 00:34:23,755
"How did she
learn that so fast?"

799
00:34:23,779 --> 00:34:25,261
And you'll say,

800
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:28,731
"Oh, I come from a long,
long line of surgeons."

801
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:32,752
You know, you're right. I'm...

802
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,516
I'm gonna head to that party.

803
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:35,805
Okay.

804
00:34:36,824 --> 00:34:38,308
Okay, bye.

805
00:34:38,377 --> 00:34:40,510
Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

806
00:34:42,114 --> 00:34:43,594
Hey. Hey.

807
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:56,092
Okay, I'm sorry.

808
00:34:56,161 --> 00:34:58,778
Uh... I can't do this.

809
00:34:58,847 --> 00:35:01,564
I need to say something to you,

810
00:35:01,633 --> 00:35:04,200
and I want to make
sure that I'm clear,

811
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:09,072
because I apparently have
been unclear in the past.

812
00:35:09,141 --> 00:35:11,307
Um... You're ending this.

813
00:35:11,376 --> 00:35:13,609
Whatever this is, it's ending.

814
00:35:16,681 --> 00:35:17,730
Yes.

815
00:35:17,799 --> 00:35:20,400
You're perfectly clear.

816
00:35:20,468 --> 00:35:22,012
You're the clearest
person I've ever known.

817
00:35:22,036 --> 00:35:24,153
You do not have
a clarity problem.

818
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:26,189
I don't? No.

819
00:35:26,258 --> 00:35:27,556
No. You've been telling me

820
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:29,926
you don't want a relationship
every day for weeks now.

821
00:35:29,994 --> 00:35:33,246
And I've been ignoring
you because you're...

822
00:35:33,315 --> 00:35:35,564
Different than any
woman I've ever known.

823
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:37,033
So that's my fault.

824
00:35:37,102 --> 00:35:39,018
I should've walked
away a long time ago.

825
00:35:39,087 --> 00:35:40,498
I can blame you for many things,

826
00:35:40,522 --> 00:35:43,456
but a lack of clarity
is not one of them.

827
00:35:44,358 --> 00:35:45,598
I'm...

828
00:35:46,661 --> 00:35:48,011
I'm sorry.

829
00:36:04,746 --> 00:36:06,346
Enjoy the party.

830
00:36:19,828 --> 00:36:23,797
My son tells me that I have
trouble admitting when I'm wrong.

831
00:36:23,865 --> 00:36:26,633
So this would be the
place where I should say

832
00:36:26,701 --> 00:36:28,585
that was an impressive save.

833
00:36:28,653 --> 00:36:30,353
Of course it was.

834
00:36:30,422 --> 00:36:31,954
He's a good kid.

835
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:34,307
Probably 'cause you've
given him such a complex,

836
00:36:34,375 --> 00:36:36,226
but for whatever the reason,

837
00:36:36,294 --> 00:36:38,277
let him find his own way.

838
00:36:38,947 --> 00:36:40,630
He'll do good.

839
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:42,032
Thank you.

840
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:45,468
Oh, and...

841
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:48,555
Don't count out Lexie
Grey till you meet her.

842
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:50,924
She's smart, she's beautiful.

843
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:53,860
She's perfect.

844
00:36:53,929 --> 00:36:56,169
A guy couldn't do any better.

845
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,027
Dr. Bailey.

846
00:37:14,316 --> 00:37:15,965
Dr. Warren.

847
00:37:16,034 --> 00:37:17,367
Um...

848
00:37:17,436 --> 00:37:20,303
Look, you're gonna
hear about something

849
00:37:20,372 --> 00:37:22,705
because everyone around
here hears about everything.

850
00:37:22,774 --> 00:37:25,742
Eli and I have ended things.

851
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:27,476
The nurse.

852
00:37:27,545 --> 00:37:29,774
You're gonna think that it
has something to do with you,

853
00:37:29,798 --> 00:37:32,531
and for the sake of clarity,

854
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:35,385
I would like to be
extremely clear

855
00:37:35,454 --> 00:37:38,521
when I say it doesn't have
anything to do with you.

856
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:39,989
At all.

857
00:37:40,058 --> 00:37:41,524
Are we clear?

858
00:37:44,129 --> 00:37:45,849
It doesn't have
anything to do with you.

859
00:37:46,415 --> 00:37:47,614
Mmm-hmm.

860
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:50,382
Ben Warren,

861
00:37:50,451 --> 00:37:53,903
I am being very clear with you.

862
00:37:53,972 --> 00:37:55,405
Are you listening to me?

863
00:37:55,474 --> 00:37:56,973
Night, Miranda Bailey.

864
00:37:57,041 --> 00:37:58,624
I'll see you tomorrow.

865
00:37:58,694 --> 00:38:01,211
No. That is not what I said.

866
00:38:03,314 --> 00:38:04,497
Benjamin Warren!

867
00:38:07,519 --> 00:38:09,919
I am so sorry for
suctioning that vein.

868
00:38:09,987 --> 00:38:11,231
I don't know what happened.

869
00:38:11,255 --> 00:38:12,588
April, stop apologizing.

870
00:38:12,657 --> 00:38:14,335
Would you let it go?
It's all worked out.

871
00:38:14,359 --> 00:38:16,993
Yeah. Honey, you
gotta learn how to relax.

872
00:38:17,061 --> 00:38:19,429
You're making a
good day feel bad.

873
00:38:19,498 --> 00:38:20,914
Hey.

874
00:38:20,982 --> 00:38:22,943
I just wanted to
thank you for the drink.

875
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:25,035
It was really nice.

876
00:38:25,103 --> 00:38:27,671
I don't... I'm... I think
that you may have...

877
00:38:27,739 --> 00:38:30,740
I think he has the
drink that you sent him.

878
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:32,692
Oh. Uh...

879
00:38:35,346 --> 00:38:36,779
Oh.

880
00:38:36,848 --> 00:38:38,576
And this is the part
where you get up and go

881
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,333
and play darts with him.

882
00:38:49,561 --> 00:38:51,728
Why are you such a meddler?

883
00:38:51,797 --> 00:38:53,717
I'm using my powers for good.

884
00:38:54,466 --> 00:38:55,699
Cheers.

885
00:39:06,861 --> 00:39:08,339
Did you try one of
these spinach things?

886
00:39:08,363 --> 00:39:09,712
They're fantastic.

887
00:39:09,781 --> 00:39:11,041
Is Cristina coming?

888
00:39:11,065 --> 00:39:13,182
Um. She can't.
Sends her apologies.

889
00:39:13,251 --> 00:39:15,696
Well, this many doctors, and
only three of you got stood up?

890
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,720
That's not bad.

891
00:39:17,789 --> 00:39:20,056
Hey. Mine's here.

892
00:39:20,124 --> 00:39:21,924
So is Eli just
gonna be late or...

893
00:39:23,094 --> 00:39:24,794
Nope.

894
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:25,961
Stuck at the hospital.

895
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,863
That dress looks great on you.

896
00:39:27,932 --> 00:39:30,066
I picked it out. Hot, right?

897
00:39:30,768 --> 00:39:32,401
Can we talk?

898
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:35,366
Listen, I want a piece of paper
that says that Sofia's mine.

899
00:39:35,390 --> 00:39:38,001
We always say that we're gonna
do it, but we never actually do it.

900
00:39:38,025 --> 00:39:39,170
Then let's do it.

901
00:39:39,194 --> 00:39:40,893
Because she's
mine. She's my baby.

902
00:39:40,962 --> 00:39:42,795
I mean, she's yours
and she's Mark's,

903
00:39:42,864 --> 00:39:44,414
but she's mine, too.

904
00:39:44,483 --> 00:39:46,294
I mean, I'm the only one that
can get her to go back to sleep

905
00:39:46,318 --> 00:39:47,361
in the middle of the night.

906
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:48,385
I know.

907
00:39:48,436 --> 00:39:50,236
And she calls me Mama.

908
00:39:50,305 --> 00:39:51,949
And I know that it
sounds like it's babbling,

909
00:39:51,973 --> 00:39:54,808
but she's saying it to me
because I'm her mama.

910
00:39:54,876 --> 00:39:57,210
I know you are.

911
00:39:57,279 --> 00:39:59,723
We'll get you that piece
of paper, okay? I promise.

912
00:39:59,747 --> 00:40:01,631
Okay. Okay. Come here.

913
00:40:01,699 --> 00:40:03,766
Okay. It's okay.

914
00:40:06,888 --> 00:40:08,604
Tell me about plastics.

915
00:40:08,673 --> 00:40:10,206
Mom, come on. I'm tired.

916
00:40:10,275 --> 00:40:11,819
And I don't want
to spend all night

917
00:40:11,843 --> 00:40:13,020
trying to convince you
it's a legitimate specialty.

918
00:40:13,044 --> 00:40:14,811
I'm asking you to
share your interests.

919
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,379
Or you can tell
me about this girl

920
00:40:16,447 --> 00:40:17,958
you shipped off to
another time zone

921
00:40:17,982 --> 00:40:19,516
in honor of my arrival.

922
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:21,529
Can you blame me? Honestly?

923
00:40:21,553 --> 00:40:23,398
I mean, look how you
were all over Sloan. I mean...

924
00:40:23,422 --> 00:40:25,087
Sloan can take it.

925
00:40:25,156 --> 00:40:26,367
You're saying this Lexie can't?

926
00:40:26,391 --> 00:40:28,824
I like her.

927
00:40:28,893 --> 00:40:30,654
A lot. I don't
want to start this.

928
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:32,445
I'm gonna meddle one more time.

929
00:40:32,514 --> 00:40:35,142
Yeah. See, if only I could
believe that, maybe we could talk...

930
00:40:35,166 --> 00:40:36,916
Sloan, be careful of him

931
00:40:36,985 --> 00:40:38,951
if you really like her.

932
00:40:40,171 --> 00:40:41,954
Why?

933
00:40:42,023 --> 00:40:45,674
Because he talks about her
the way you should, that's why.

934
00:40:45,743 --> 00:40:48,111
Yeah. They were a thing.

935
00:40:48,179 --> 00:40:50,029
That's over now. Mmm-hmm.

936
00:40:53,601 --> 00:40:55,618
Are you in love with her?

937
00:40:57,355 --> 00:40:59,333
We're not gonna talk about this.

938
00:41:01,092 --> 00:41:03,759
<i>We're so hopeful at
the beginning of things.</i>

939
00:41:05,496 --> 00:41:08,631
<i>It seems like there's
only a world to be gained,</i>

940
00:41:10,302 --> 00:41:11,734
<i>not lost.</i>

941
00:41:14,873 --> 00:41:16,239
That's her.

942
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:19,136
Hello. CRISTINA: <i>Hey.</i>

943
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,840
You ready? <i>Yeah.</i>

944
00:41:22,296 --> 00:41:23,429
Okay, go.

945
00:41:23,497 --> 00:41:26,298
<i>Hi, baby girl.</i>

946
00:41:26,367 --> 00:41:29,680
Is Aunt Cristina getting
ready to put you to bed?

947
00:41:29,704 --> 00:41:31,104
We love you.

948
00:41:32,741 --> 00:41:34,473
Hey, Zo.

949
00:41:34,542 --> 00:41:35,775
Ready to close your eyes?

950
00:41:37,128 --> 00:41:38,210
<i>Yeah?</i>

951
00:41:58,583 --> 00:42:02,418
<i>They say the inability to
accept loss is a form of insanity.</i>

952
00:42:03,672 --> 00:42:05,037
We love you.

953
00:42:05,106 --> 00:42:06,806
Good night.

954
00:42:06,874 --> 00:42:08,624
<i>It's probably true.</i>

955
00:42:10,628 --> 00:42:12,211
<i>But sometimes,</i>

956
00:42:13,899 --> 00:42:16,149
<i>it's the only way to stay alive.</i>
