1
00:00:10,077 --> 00:00:11,443
Taxi!

2
00:00:11,512 --> 00:00:13,345
<i>Carpe diem.</i>

3
00:00:14,448 --> 00:00:16,849
That was hell.
Actual physical hell.

4
00:00:16,917 --> 00:00:18,550
I think I went a tad overboard.

5
00:00:18,618 --> 00:00:20,785
<i>How annoying is carpe diem?</i>

6
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:22,054
A lot overboard.

7
00:00:22,122 --> 00:00:23,433
They took something from me.

8
00:00:23,457 --> 00:00:25,418
Yeah, that wasn't an exam.
That was an interrogation.

9
00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:27,926
Like, way, way overboard.

10
00:00:27,994 --> 00:00:29,739
The mind games. Trick questions.

11
00:00:29,763 --> 00:00:31,341
It felt like al-Qaeda in there.

12
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:35,283
<i>How are you supposed to
plan a life, a career, a family,</i>

13
00:00:35,352 --> 00:00:37,970
<i>if you're always
carpe-ing the diem?</i>

14
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,838
Next test is June.

15
00:00:39,907 --> 00:00:41,440
June's not bad.

16
00:00:41,508 --> 00:00:43,224
2013.

17
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:44,860
Oh.

18
00:00:44,929 --> 00:00:47,646
What's done is done. Let's just
not even talk about it anymore.

19
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:50,215
<i>If we all seized every
moment of every day,</i>

20
00:00:50,284 --> 00:00:51,633
<i>there wouldn't be doctors.</i>

21
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:53,129
<i>Who would sit
through med school?</i>

22
00:00:53,153 --> 00:00:55,332
Anyone know how Alex did?

23
00:00:55,356 --> 00:00:57,083
Anyone know if Alex made it?

24
00:00:57,107 --> 00:00:58,107
Made it?

25
00:00:58,175 --> 00:01:00,215
What do you mean, "Made it"?

26
00:01:02,196 --> 00:01:04,762
<i>We'd all be too busy</i>

27
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:07,265
<i>living in the now.</i>

28
00:01:07,318 --> 00:01:09,083
<i>Whatever that means.</i>

29
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:10,585
Hey.

30
00:01:11,372 --> 00:01:12,921
You okay?

31
00:01:13,724 --> 00:01:15,774
I'm not sure.

32
00:01:15,842 --> 00:01:18,393
I hope you're not
worried about last night.

33
00:01:18,462 --> 00:01:20,207
I'm not worried
about last night.

34
00:01:20,231 --> 00:01:22,508
I'm worried because I
checked with some of my friends

35
00:01:22,532 --> 00:01:24,299
on the committee,

36
00:01:24,368 --> 00:01:27,919
and one of your Seattle
Grace doctors didn't pass.

37
00:01:27,988 --> 00:01:29,287
Any idea who?

38
00:01:29,356 --> 00:01:32,407
They weren't sure.
But if it's Jackson,

39
00:01:32,493 --> 00:01:34,973
he'll blame me forever.

40
00:01:37,898 --> 00:01:39,565
Welcome to the
American Medical Board

41
00:01:39,633 --> 00:01:41,433
of Surgery Certifying
Examination.

42
00:01:41,502 --> 00:01:42,996
We'll give you four
separate scenarios

43
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,786
in three 30-minute sessions,

44
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:46,688
10-minute breaks in between.

45
00:01:46,757 --> 00:01:49,485
To pass the test, you must
pass two of the three sessions.

46
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:51,303
Now, you can fail a
session and still pass.

47
00:01:51,327 --> 00:01:54,106
Still pass. But examiners
are not permitted to indicate

48
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:56,781
whether you passed
or failed each session.

49
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:00,235
You'll be rated on your ability
to diagnose, manage treatment,

50
00:02:00,304 --> 00:02:01,736
handle the unexpected,

51
00:02:01,805 --> 00:02:04,489
basically, the strength of
your constitution in crisis.

52
00:02:06,744 --> 00:02:11,229
And when we move
on to the next scenario,

53
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:16,301
there's no doubling
back, meaning,

54
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,247
once a question is asked...

55
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:20,031
You can't go back.
Understood, sir.

56
00:02:22,726 --> 00:02:25,460
Are you in a hurry, Dr. Yang?

57
00:02:25,528 --> 00:02:28,263
No, sir. Just ready
when you are.

58
00:02:29,183 --> 00:02:30,448
Mm-hmm.

59
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:35,353
So then, a 65-year-old woman

60
00:02:35,422 --> 00:02:38,702
is being seen by her
primary care physician

61
00:02:38,726 --> 00:02:41,643
for a workup of osteoporosis

62
00:02:41,711 --> 00:02:45,130
when she is found to
have elevated calcium.

63
00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:48,500
Her PTH level was
well above normal.

64
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:51,336
Her doctor sends her to you.

65
00:02:51,404 --> 00:02:54,217
Elevated calcium and
PTH would indicate

66
00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:55,824
primary hyperparathyroidism.

67
00:02:55,892 --> 00:02:58,052
I would offer the
patient a para...

68
00:02:58,795 --> 00:03:00,011
thyroidectomy.

69
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,858
And first, I would
explore the right side.

70
00:03:01,882 --> 00:03:03,248
If that gland is large...

71
00:03:03,316 --> 00:03:05,884
I would biopsy it.

72
00:03:05,953 --> 00:03:09,287
After doing the
biopsy, I would...

73
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:11,606
Hang on. What did the
pathologist's report say?

74
00:03:11,675 --> 00:03:15,137
Path comes back with
parathyroid hyperplasia.

75
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:16,428
Uh, oh...

76
00:03:16,496 --> 00:03:18,330
And how large was the gland?

77
00:03:21,251 --> 00:03:23,611
How much longer are we
gonna give this Dr. Karev?

78
00:03:24,655 --> 00:03:26,304
Fifteen?

79
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:29,508
Next, I would resect it and
explore the other glands.

80
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:32,493
Aggressive choice.

81
00:03:32,562 --> 00:03:37,332
Well, I suppose I could wait for
the IPM before taking further actions.

82
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,766
Mm-hmm.

83
00:03:38,836 --> 00:03:41,156
Are you sure you're
okay with that?

84
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:47,426
Yes, I'm okay with that.

85
00:03:48,662 --> 00:03:50,728
If the IPM

86
00:03:50,797 --> 00:03:53,398
showed PTH levels
in the normal range...

87
00:03:55,436 --> 00:03:57,151
Dr. Grey?

88
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:59,660
I would feel comfortable
concluding the procedure.

89
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,367
Dude, there's no other way?

90
00:04:12,435 --> 00:04:14,453
Helicopter. Magic carpet.

91
00:04:14,521 --> 00:04:15,754
That lane is open.

92
00:04:15,823 --> 00:04:18,143
That's the bus lane. I
don't see any buses.

93
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:19,852
I'll get a ticket.

94
00:04:19,876 --> 00:04:21,554
Come on, man. I'll give
you double any ticket.

95
00:04:21,578 --> 00:04:22,788
What about my insurance?

96
00:04:22,812 --> 00:04:24,463
Come on, man. Just
take the bus lane.

97
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:28,161
Nah. How far are we?

98
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:30,305
Twenty blocks, give or take.

99
00:04:34,508 --> 00:04:36,668
Catch the game last night?

100
00:04:36,844 --> 00:04:38,238
Come on, come on. Move.

101
00:04:38,262 --> 00:04:40,342
I heard it went 11 innings.

102
00:04:42,265 --> 00:04:44,105
Move! Move! Look out! Move!

103
00:04:46,136 --> 00:04:49,337
Come one, come on! Almost
there. Move, it's a hurry.

104
00:04:53,193 --> 00:04:54,970
Okay, who wants more pancakes?

105
00:04:54,994 --> 00:04:56,695
You haven't had any. Sit down.

106
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:59,325
I can't sit still. He's
taking his test right now.

107
00:04:59,349 --> 00:05:02,300
It's cute, you being
nervous for Jackson.

108
00:05:02,369 --> 00:05:04,380
You want some more
juice? It's paternal.

109
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:05,970
You're a natural father.

110
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:08,484
Are you sure you don't want
anything? I could make some bacon...

111
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:10,258
We should have a baby.

112
00:05:14,264 --> 00:05:18,317
Don't freak out. I
mean, I like this.

113
00:05:18,385 --> 00:05:20,435
I like you, I like your kid,

114
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,103
and I like your
kid's moms. And I...

115
00:05:25,509 --> 00:05:28,042
You know, you don't have
to say anything right now.

116
00:05:28,111 --> 00:05:30,562
Just go back to
worrying about Jackson,

117
00:05:30,631 --> 00:05:33,031
and we can talk
about this later.

118
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,633
I would say no
rush, but, you know,

119
00:05:35,703 --> 00:05:37,919
actually, my FSH
levels would suggest that

120
00:05:37,988 --> 00:05:40,388
rushing a little might not be
the worst thing in the world.

121
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:54,185
Julia wants to have
a baby with Mark.

122
00:05:54,254 --> 00:05:55,582
I can't even deal
with that right now.

123
00:05:55,606 --> 00:05:57,172
Wow.

124
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,551
I should've picked him up myself.
I mean, what's wrong with me?

125
00:05:59,575 --> 00:06:02,143
Okay, I thought he was your
brother's best friend, not yours.

126
00:06:02,212 --> 00:06:05,914
We were all super close, and
he was my rock when Tim died.

127
00:06:05,983 --> 00:06:08,183
I just... Oh, God. I
let my rock take a cab.

128
00:06:08,218 --> 00:06:09,834
So you let him take a cab.

129
00:06:09,903 --> 00:06:11,848
Well, I mean, listen,
he just flew in from Tibet

130
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:13,355
and he has cancer.

131
00:06:13,423 --> 00:06:14,122
I mean, the least I
could do is pick him up at

132
00:06:14,191 --> 00:06:15,431
the baggage claim.

133
00:06:15,492 --> 00:06:17,492
Hey, hey, hey. Okay,
you need to chill out.

134
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:21,296
Look, I know that you're
worried, but as far as cancers go,

135
00:06:21,364 --> 00:06:22,798
I mean, his is
very slow-growing.

136
00:06:22,866 --> 00:06:24,644
He told you he found
out, what, six months ago?

137
00:06:24,668 --> 00:06:27,202
I mean, he could be fine.

138
00:06:27,271 --> 00:06:28,931
Yeah. Yeah.

139
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:31,234
Well, with you in the
OR, I'm not worried.

140
00:06:31,258 --> 00:06:33,519
You're gonna love him,
and he's gonna love you.

141
00:06:33,543 --> 00:06:36,027
Well, I'm taking his tumor
out. It's the least he could do.

142
00:06:36,096 --> 00:06:37,462
Phoenix.

143
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,097
Nick!

144
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:43,301
Hey. It's good to see you.

145
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:45,336
Oh! Wait. What's with the cane?

146
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,250
Tumor, man. It hurts to walk.

147
00:06:47,274 --> 00:06:50,575
Already? But you were only
diagnosed six months ago.

148
00:06:50,644 --> 00:06:53,445
Did I say months?
I meant years. So...

149
00:06:53,514 --> 00:06:55,847
You must be the wife. Yeah.

150
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:57,382
Good to meet you.

151
00:06:57,451 --> 00:06:59,501
Good to meet you, too.

152
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:02,320
Julia went all FSH
on me this morning.

153
00:07:02,388 --> 00:07:03,488
Is that a sexual term?

154
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:05,356
Wait. You know what?
I don't want to know.

155
00:07:05,426 --> 00:07:07,270
She wants a baby.
She wants my baby.

156
00:07:07,294 --> 00:07:09,027
What did you say?

157
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:10,762
Nothing. It's crazy.

158
00:07:10,831 --> 00:07:14,210
Until you think about it and
realize it's kind of genius.

159
00:07:14,234 --> 00:07:16,045
I love Julia. I want Sofia to

160
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:17,780
have some siblings
to grow up with.

161
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:19,044
Why wouldn't I do it?

162
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:20,783
Are you asking me if
you should have a baby?

163
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:22,134
What, you think I shouldn't?

164
00:07:22,158 --> 00:07:23,836
Have a baby or ask me if
you should have a baby?

165
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,271
So you think I should do it?

166
00:07:25,295 --> 00:07:27,306
Well, do you want Julia
to be in your life forever?

167
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:29,008
You think I shouldn't do it?

168
00:07:29,032 --> 00:07:30,552
Do you have to
answer that right now?

169
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:32,416
Hey. Answer what?

170
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:34,536
We were just talking
about the cranioplasty.

171
00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:36,882
Oh, it's exciting, right?

172
00:07:36,906 --> 00:07:38,840
Mm. Yeah.

173
00:07:38,909 --> 00:07:42,327
Charlie Connor, 37. He fell
off the roof six months ago.

174
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:44,674
He presents for repair
of a skull bone defect

175
00:07:44,698 --> 00:07:46,676
that occurred secondary
to surgical removal

176
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,300
of part of his skull.

177
00:07:48,368 --> 00:07:49,629
We waited several
months for the swelling

178
00:07:49,653 --> 00:07:51,564
to subside before...

179
00:07:51,588 --> 00:07:54,089
What were you doing anyway?

180
00:07:54,157 --> 00:07:56,057
Being an idiot.

181
00:07:56,126 --> 00:07:57,303
You gonna fix it next time?

182
00:07:57,327 --> 00:07:59,427
No, I want the roofers
to fix it next time,

183
00:07:59,496 --> 00:08:01,529
like they had
to do it this time,

184
00:08:01,598 --> 00:08:03,982
because Humpty Dumpty
almost killed himself.

185
00:08:04,051 --> 00:08:05,428
You want to pay for it?

186
00:08:05,452 --> 00:08:07,886
Okay, we have
mirrored the healthy skull

187
00:08:07,955 --> 00:08:09,588
and created a
custom titanium plate

188
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:11,255
that we will secure to the bone.

189
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:14,542
Titanium. Like The Terminator.

190
00:08:14,611 --> 00:08:17,040
And I'll take fat from the
belly and fill in the gaps,

191
00:08:17,064 --> 00:08:18,491
pull your face into shape.

192
00:08:18,515 --> 00:08:21,966
So, Doc, what are you using to
fasten the new skull into place?

193
00:08:22,035 --> 00:08:23,612
Hexagonal screws? Yes.

194
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:25,102
You know your stuff.

195
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,383
Yeah, we could do this in my
garage. Save me a few grand.

196
00:08:27,407 --> 00:08:28,718
You got a 2-millimeter bit?

197
00:08:28,742 --> 00:08:30,769
Do I have a 2-millimeter bit?

198
00:08:30,793 --> 00:08:32,844
Please! Don't encourage him.

199
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:35,013
What? No.

200
00:08:35,082 --> 00:08:37,910
I am counting on you to treat
these candidates extremely well.

201
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:40,379
Show them whatever they
want to see. Really woo them.

202
00:08:40,403 --> 00:08:42,136
"Woo"? Yeah, woo. You know.

203
00:08:42,205 --> 00:08:44,405
What about me says "woo"?

204
00:08:44,474 --> 00:08:45,918
After the boards,
we might be losing

205
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:47,920
some very good doctors
to other programs.

206
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:49,855
Now, if that happens,
we need to be sure

207
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:51,724
that we have some
fresh talent ready

208
00:08:51,748 --> 00:08:53,258
and willing to take their place,

209
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:54,682
so I am asking you,

210
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:58,269
as Chief, please
woo their socks off.

211
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:03,424
For you. Just this
once, I will woo.

212
00:09:03,493 --> 00:09:04,758
Their socks off?

213
00:09:04,827 --> 00:09:06,194
Don't push it.

214
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:08,562
Hi.

215
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:09,964
Hey.

216
00:09:10,033 --> 00:09:12,066
Hey, um, so,

217
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:14,936
do you have any word on what
Cristina's plans are for next year?

218
00:09:15,004 --> 00:09:16,337
No. No, not yet.

219
00:09:16,405 --> 00:09:19,040
Okay. Will you keep me posted?

220
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:21,776
I will.

221
00:09:21,844 --> 00:09:22,861
Good. Thanks.

222
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:42,146
The first session was so easy.

223
00:09:44,885 --> 00:09:47,005
I want to punch your face.

224
00:09:55,811 --> 00:09:56,994
Hey.

225
00:09:57,063 --> 00:10:00,097
Hi. I am so, so
sorry to interrupt.

226
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:01,967
I'm Dr. Karev.

227
00:10:02,035 --> 00:10:04,515
I was stuck in Seattle
with a patient, and...

228
00:10:04,554 --> 00:10:07,083
Well, I don't want to bore you
with a bunch of travel crap...

229
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:09,168
Your time was set
for 9:00 this morning.

230
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:10,687
We were here. We
called your name.

231
00:10:10,711 --> 00:10:12,455
Yeah, I was with a
patient. You get that.

232
00:10:12,479 --> 00:10:16,030
We all have patients,
Dr. Karev. Yet, here we were.

233
00:10:16,099 --> 00:10:18,065
So what? I just fail?

234
00:10:18,134 --> 00:10:20,268
The first of three
sessions, yes.

235
00:10:20,337 --> 00:10:23,505
Which means you need perfect
scores in the next two sessions.

236
00:10:26,643 --> 00:10:28,153
How are you everywhere?

237
00:10:28,177 --> 00:10:30,578
How'd it go for you in there?

238
00:10:30,647 --> 00:10:32,458
Look, baby, I know
you were shocked.

239
00:10:32,482 --> 00:10:33,948
Shocked?

240
00:10:34,017 --> 00:10:36,763
Shocked at the sight
of my mother half-naked

241
00:10:36,787 --> 00:10:38,948
with a senior attending
at my hospital?

242
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:41,012
No, far from it. Okay?

243
00:10:41,074 --> 00:10:43,519
I mean, it's kind of par for
the course for you, right, Mom?

244
00:10:43,543 --> 00:10:46,506
But every door that I open,
every corner that I turn,

245
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:47,846
there you are.

246
00:10:47,914 --> 00:10:50,949
I know I'm your mother,
but I'm also a woman.

247
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:52,450
I have needs.

248
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:53,963
If you don't want
to talk about this

249
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:55,381
like an adult,
don't bring it up.

250
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:56,799
Wait a second. Did I
bring it up? Did I bring it up?

251
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:58,756
Don't play games.
Just talk to me.

252
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:02,505
Just leave me alone! I'm in
the middle of my freakin' boards.

253
00:11:04,814 --> 00:11:06,548
Are you following me, Mom?

254
00:11:06,616 --> 00:11:09,384
I'm the examiner in the
room right next to yours.

255
00:11:09,453 --> 00:11:10,968
Of course, you are.

256
00:11:13,323 --> 00:11:16,023
After that, I might
mobilize the small intestine

257
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:17,692
to create a Roux limb,

258
00:11:17,761 --> 00:11:19,761
and open up the pancreatic duct

259
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:21,963
longitudinally from
the tail to the neck?

260
00:11:22,031 --> 00:11:23,430
The patient has died.

261
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,482
Moving on to the next scenario.

262
00:11:29,506 --> 00:11:30,799
Can we go back
just for a second?

263
00:11:30,823 --> 00:11:32,051
We're moving on, Dr. Kepner.

264
00:11:32,075 --> 00:11:33,703
A 38-year-old
male with a history...

265
00:11:33,727 --> 00:11:35,471
But if we could go back for
one second so that I can clarify.

266
00:11:35,495 --> 00:11:36,944
You have a 40-year-old man

267
00:11:37,013 --> 00:11:39,747
who complains of rectal pain
and burning with defecation,

268
00:11:39,816 --> 00:11:42,550
and occasionally some
blood in the bowel movement.

269
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:44,752
I would do a rigid sigmoidoscopy

270
00:11:44,821 --> 00:11:47,901
to make sure there were
no lesions in the rectum.

271
00:11:48,341 --> 00:11:50,285
Squeamish,
Dr. Grey? No, not at all.

272
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:52,276
Good, then let's pick up
the answers, shall we?

273
00:11:52,345 --> 00:11:55,224
Of course. If there were
lesions in the rectum,

274
00:11:55,248 --> 00:11:58,216
I would do an incisional biopsy

275
00:11:59,853 --> 00:12:01,030
and begin to fulgurate...

276
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:02,899
I would cover the
bowel with omentum

277
00:12:02,923 --> 00:12:04,733
and close the fascia primarily.

278
00:12:04,757 --> 00:12:06,435
The sutures tear right
through the fascia.

279
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:09,171
In that case, I would use
1-0 nylon retention sutures

280
00:12:09,195 --> 00:12:11,515
through the full thickness
of the abdominal wall.

281
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:15,182
Moving on.

282
00:12:15,251 --> 00:12:16,662
Because I would
make sure the area

283
00:12:16,686 --> 00:12:18,063
was adequately
drained and closed.

284
00:12:18,087 --> 00:12:19,286
Dr. Kepner...

285
00:12:19,355 --> 00:12:20,833
Because if it leaked,
and if the leak was early,

286
00:12:20,857 --> 00:12:23,024
I would re-explore the
patient and repair the leak,

287
00:12:23,092 --> 00:12:24,792
making sure that if...

288
00:12:24,861 --> 00:12:26,172
Once the question is finished...

289
00:12:26,196 --> 00:12:28,162
Finished. Yes, I
know. I'm sorry.

290
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:38,823
I just really need
you to understand

291
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:40,886
that if the leak was late, I
would obtain an abdominal CT.

292
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:44,278
Just to make sure, and also, if it
wasn't, if it wasn't drained... God.

293
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:46,798
Can you hang on
just for a second?

294
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:49,417
It's just so
incredibly hot in here.

295
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:53,371
Oh, God. Oh, God.

296
00:12:55,659 --> 00:12:57,124
Uh...

297
00:12:57,194 --> 00:12:59,744
Can we move on, Dr. Kepner?

298
00:12:59,813 --> 00:13:02,133
Would you allow
us that courtesy?

299
00:13:02,298 --> 00:13:03,731
Yes.

300
00:13:04,601 --> 00:13:05,833
Yes.

301
00:13:08,171 --> 00:13:09,748
Great. Thank you.

302
00:13:09,772 --> 00:13:12,919
Now a 38-year-old male
with a history of diabetes...

303
00:13:12,943 --> 00:13:15,543
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm
sorry. Just, just, just...

304
00:13:15,612 --> 00:13:17,372
Just one last thing going
back to the beginning,

305
00:13:17,396 --> 00:13:19,608
'cause you heard what I said about
finding the pancreatic duct, right?

306
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,544
Because I really want
to make sure you know

307
00:13:21,568 --> 00:13:24,602
that I would drain
the anastomosis...

308
00:13:25,922 --> 00:13:30,375
That patient should
be stable! They just...

309
00:13:30,443 --> 00:13:33,377
Why won't you tell
me? Just tell me!

310
00:13:33,446 --> 00:13:35,079
How am I supposed to answer this

311
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:37,015
question without
the full information?

312
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:38,282
Please...

313
00:13:44,273 --> 00:13:47,408
Look, I'm a really good doctor.

314
00:13:47,477 --> 00:13:51,111
I am. I just... I need
all the information.

315
00:13:51,948 --> 00:13:53,180
I'm...

316
00:13:54,451 --> 00:13:56,116
I'm a really good doctor.

317
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:01,539
Um... No free air.

318
00:14:02,876 --> 00:14:05,893
The spleen looks fine.

319
00:14:05,962 --> 00:14:08,312
There is some
perihepatic fluid...

320
00:14:11,218 --> 00:14:14,452
I'm sorry. Are you guys
hearing this noise next door?

321
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:17,772
It's very distracting. If we could
just ask them to keep it down.

322
00:14:17,858 --> 00:14:19,852
If you get
distracted this easily,

323
00:14:19,876 --> 00:14:22,154
I think it calls to
question your ability

324
00:14:22,178 --> 00:14:24,406
to function in a high-volume OR.

325
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:25,824
Certainly calls
it into question.

326
00:14:25,848 --> 00:14:27,147
It is not that at all.

327
00:14:27,216 --> 00:14:30,017
Okay? It's just my...

328
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:32,586
Um...

329
00:14:34,423 --> 00:14:36,368
Never mind. Let's wait
for traffic to die down.

330
00:14:36,392 --> 00:14:38,136
We wouldn't want to throw
you off your game, Dr. Avery.

331
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,905
I'm fine. Let's just... Shhh!

332
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:47,234
I would stop the patient's continuous
bleeding with a portacaval shunt.

333
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:49,320
Your patient is now in a coma.

334
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:52,368
That's highly unlikely,
but, in that case,

335
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:55,960
I would suspect a
hepatic encephalopathy

336
00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:58,346
and check an ammonia
level to confirm.

337
00:14:58,414 --> 00:15:00,414
I'll save you the trouble.

338
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:02,050
It's confirmed.

339
00:15:02,118 --> 00:15:02,784
I'd check the
patient's medication...

340
00:15:02,852 --> 00:15:04,092
Medication...

341
00:15:04,137 --> 00:15:05,631
Okay, then I'd start on
lactulose and neomycin.

342
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:07,516
The patient... Still
not getting better?

343
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:10,508
Then I would do a shunt
revision with a stent graft.

344
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:12,457
Stent graft? Yes, a stent graft.

345
00:15:12,812 --> 00:15:14,212
Hmm.

346
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,496
Well...

347
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:19,751
Risky move, Dr. Yang.

348
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,469
Well...

349
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:23,854
Moving on.

350
00:15:25,292 --> 00:15:27,573
Did you have something
to add, Dr. Yang?

351
00:15:29,111 --> 00:15:30,628
Nope. All good.

352
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:37,146
Does that hurt? Nope.

353
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:39,003
What about...

354
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:41,631
Yeah. That's what happens when
you wait six years to get treated.

355
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:45,176
So she's not shy.

356
00:15:45,245 --> 00:15:46,889
Yeah, I know. I
never went for shy.

357
00:15:46,913 --> 00:15:48,345
Yeah.

358
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:49,997
I've been working
with a naturopath.

359
00:15:50,066 --> 00:15:51,777
I figured I'd try the
nontraditional route.

360
00:15:51,801 --> 00:15:52,900
It helped.

361
00:15:52,968 --> 00:15:54,702
It did.

362
00:15:54,771 --> 00:15:58,839
But then the pain started to
kick up, so I saw a real doctor.

363
00:15:58,908 --> 00:16:01,475
He was gonna send me
to an orthopedic surgeon,

364
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:02,671
but then I was like, "Hold up.

365
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:05,196
"Yuma Robbins just
married one of those."

366
00:16:05,265 --> 00:16:06,676
Not that it was a real wedding.

367
00:16:07,867 --> 00:16:09,366
Excuse me?

368
00:16:09,419 --> 00:16:11,129
Oh, uh... She
thinks you're serious.

369
00:16:11,153 --> 00:16:13,320
I am serious. Tucson's
already married.

370
00:16:14,023 --> 00:16:15,189
To him.

371
00:16:15,258 --> 00:16:16,774
She loves me. We were 10.

372
00:16:16,843 --> 00:16:20,478
It was in my tree house, and
we had rings made of crabgrass.

373
00:16:20,547 --> 00:16:22,041
You're probably the
last guy I ever kissed.

374
00:16:22,065 --> 00:16:25,499
It was a beautiful ceremony.
Tim officiated, her brother.

375
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:29,570
He made me swear to stop
pulling the streamers off of her bike.

376
00:16:29,638 --> 00:16:31,716
It was an issue for a while.

377
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,568
Yeah, I'm a little concerned
about how much pain you're in.

378
00:16:33,592 --> 00:16:36,955
So I am going to order some
new scans. These are how old?

379
00:16:36,979 --> 00:16:39,546
Nine, you know, maybe 12
months. I had to finish up a project

380
00:16:39,616 --> 00:16:41,832
on the guys who carry
all the tourists' crap up K2.

381
00:16:41,901 --> 00:16:43,012
With a cane?

382
00:16:43,036 --> 00:16:44,068
I stayed at base camp.

383
00:16:44,137 --> 00:16:45,577
Play through the pain, right?

384
00:16:45,638 --> 00:16:47,404
No. Anybody?

385
00:16:49,659 --> 00:16:51,320
Is she always like
that, or am I dying?

386
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:53,777
No, you are going to be fine,

387
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:55,758
because she is a
genius with a scalpel.

388
00:16:55,782 --> 00:16:57,093
She'll be in and out, and
you won't even know it.

389
00:16:57,117 --> 00:16:58,660
And they're not even
gonna use drugs.

390
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:01,118
Nope, nope, just chamomile tea.

391
00:17:02,338 --> 00:17:03,720
You are so damn cute.

392
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:05,034
How does she get through
a work day with you around?

393
00:17:05,058 --> 00:17:07,098
I don't know.

394
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:11,490
I forgot how much I missed you.

395
00:17:11,514 --> 00:17:12,947
Me, too.

396
00:17:18,087 --> 00:17:20,855
And our surgical
rotations often allow

397
00:17:20,923 --> 00:17:23,624
flexibility to set aside
consecutive days

398
00:17:23,693 --> 00:17:26,593
for research projects and
field work, if necessary.

399
00:17:26,662 --> 00:17:27,978
Any questions?

400
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,691
Would I have to share an office?

401
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,048
We don't...

402
00:17:31,117 --> 00:17:34,201
I'll have to check on that.

403
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:36,304
Are parking spaces
assigned for attendings,

404
00:17:36,372 --> 00:17:38,656
or do we have to,
like, find our own?

405
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:40,324
I'll have to check on that.

406
00:17:50,954 --> 00:17:52,954
All right, we just need
to screw this down

407
00:17:53,022 --> 00:17:54,956
and then adjust it to fit.

408
00:17:56,392 --> 00:18:00,528
Well, Mark said that
I get to graft the fat.

409
00:18:00,613 --> 00:18:02,379
How cool is that?

410
00:18:02,449 --> 00:18:03,864
Yeah, that's cool.

411
00:18:06,402 --> 00:18:08,647
I'm gonna be your big
brother for 30 seconds.

412
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:10,070
Okay.

413
00:18:10,139 --> 00:18:13,474
Julia wants to have
a baby with Mark.

414
00:18:13,543 --> 00:18:16,494
She what? What did she say?

415
00:18:16,562 --> 00:18:18,657
Well, I don't know. What do
you mean, you don't know?

416
00:18:18,681 --> 00:18:20,948
What did he say?
How did it go down?

417
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:23,128
My 30 seconds of
brotherly advice is over.

418
00:18:23,152 --> 00:18:24,529
I got to go check on a patient.

419
00:18:24,553 --> 00:18:25,970
No... Does he want to do it?

420
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:27,916
I mean, did it seem like
he was excited about it,

421
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,785
or does he seem like,
"That's an insane idea"?

422
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:31,825
Because it is. Yeah,
you know what?

423
00:18:31,895 --> 00:18:35,930
I hope you told him
that it's an insane idea.

424
00:18:38,418 --> 00:18:41,151
Are all your questions gross?

425
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:42,953
Gross? What do you mean, gross?

426
00:18:43,022 --> 00:18:46,707
They keep asking me about
bowels and bloody stools.

427
00:18:46,776 --> 00:18:48,304
It's general surgery.
What do you expect?

428
00:18:48,328 --> 00:18:50,778
You're not helping, at all.

429
00:18:50,846 --> 00:18:53,630
My guy is a freakin' fossil.

430
00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:56,951
The last time he was in
the OR, it was lit by candles.

431
00:18:57,019 --> 00:19:01,438
Maybe I'll just live in
here, in this stall, in my filth

432
00:19:02,542 --> 00:19:03,607
till I die.

433
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:06,460
Sick woman in here. Go away.

434
00:19:06,528 --> 00:19:08,513
I really need to get in there.

435
00:19:08,581 --> 00:19:09,858
Sorry. Closed for maintenance.

436
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:12,082
Please let me in.
Come back later!

437
00:19:18,841 --> 00:19:21,186
Hey, the applicants keep
asking to see the gym.

438
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:22,421
Should I show it to them?

439
00:19:22,445 --> 00:19:23,638
'Cause I don't want the cobwebs

440
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:25,174
and sweaty menthol
stench to scare them...

441
00:19:25,198 --> 00:19:26,609
When did I become
the advice columnist?

442
00:19:26,633 --> 00:19:28,577
Touchy, touchy. Well, I'm sorry.

443
00:19:28,601 --> 00:19:29,979
It's just, no one can seem to
make up their own mind today.

444
00:19:30,003 --> 00:19:32,014
People do make
up their own minds,

445
00:19:32,038 --> 00:19:34,016
they just need a little
help getting there.

446
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,572
What do you mean?

447
00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:37,652
Okay, if someone comes
to me with a problem...

448
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,054
Yeah. I give them a metaphor.

449
00:19:39,078 --> 00:19:40,211
A metaphor?

450
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:41,590
A figure of speech, which...

451
00:19:41,614 --> 00:19:43,225
Yes, I know what a
metaphor is. Fantastic.

452
00:19:43,249 --> 00:19:45,694
Now, the next time someone
comes to you with a problem,

453
00:19:45,718 --> 00:19:46,962
you just give them a metaphor.

454
00:19:46,986 --> 00:19:48,068
Any kind of metaphor?

455
00:19:48,137 --> 00:19:49,198
See? That's the beauty of it.

456
00:19:49,222 --> 00:19:51,533
They'll draw some
meaning from it,

457
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:53,235
and it'll help them
to make the decision

458
00:19:53,259 --> 00:19:54,803
they were gonna
make in the first place.

459
00:19:54,827 --> 00:19:56,727
I'll stick with being
honest, thank you.

460
00:19:56,796 --> 00:19:59,557
Suit yourself, but when
they take your advice

461
00:19:59,581 --> 00:20:00,826
and it doesn't work out,

462
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:03,210
honesty can bite you in the ass.

463
00:20:05,338 --> 00:20:06,815
If you don't mind,
it is a men's room.

464
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:09,218
What? What? You're
supposed to be doctors.

465
00:20:09,242 --> 00:20:11,220
I've seen your things.
You've seen mine.

466
00:20:11,244 --> 00:20:13,994
It's all just flesh and
cartilage. Get over it!

467
00:20:15,698 --> 00:20:17,631
April, what...

468
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,216
Hey, Jackson. How's it going?

469
00:20:19,285 --> 00:20:21,051
Not so good. You?

470
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,953
I am dying in there.

471
00:20:23,022 --> 00:20:24,888
I am actually failing.

472
00:20:24,957 --> 00:20:27,069
You, too? 'Cause
mine is a total fiasco.

473
00:20:27,093 --> 00:20:29,026
They think I'm insane!

474
00:20:29,095 --> 00:20:30,305
They're toying with me.

475
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:32,429
I am self-destructing
into a puddle of sweat.

476
00:20:32,498 --> 00:20:34,331
I don't know what's
wrong with me.

477
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,611
I know exactly what is wrong
with me and I still can't reel it in.

478
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:38,435
I broke my promise to Jesus,

479
00:20:38,504 --> 00:20:41,405
and now I can't even
talk to him and I need him.

480
00:20:41,474 --> 00:20:43,557
He's the only one
who can calm me down!

481
00:20:43,626 --> 00:20:45,237
Why the hell did you
do it? Why'd you let me?

482
00:20:45,261 --> 00:20:46,788
I don't know! You
said it was okay.

483
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:48,239
I know! I knew you'd regret it!

484
00:20:48,263 --> 00:20:50,041
Stop yelling! Why
are you yelling at me?

485
00:20:50,065 --> 00:20:51,977
Because I'm all
messed up now, too.

486
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:53,700
I mean, what am I?

487
00:20:53,769 --> 00:20:55,431
I'm now the guy that made you
break your promise to Jesus?

488
00:20:55,455 --> 00:20:57,053
I am not that guy! All right?

489
00:20:57,122 --> 00:20:58,383
That guy is gross, okay?

490
00:20:58,407 --> 00:21:00,607
It's all very unbecoming,
especially for an Avery.

491
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:02,459
What?

492
00:21:02,528 --> 00:21:06,930
Are you honestly comparing
breaking my promise to Jesus

493
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:09,934
with putting a tiny dent
in your family crest?

494
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:13,921
You're right.

495
00:21:14,924 --> 00:21:16,490
You're right, and I'm sorry.

496
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:22,213
My mom is the examiner in
the room right next to mine.

497
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,380
It's throwing me.

498
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:24,748
Oh, God.

499
00:21:24,817 --> 00:21:27,084
I know. I'm worried about my mom

500
00:21:27,153 --> 00:21:29,820
and what she's
gonna think if I fail.

501
00:21:29,888 --> 00:21:31,355
It's pathetic.

502
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:33,357
Right?

503
00:21:33,426 --> 00:21:34,636
No. God, no, Jackson.

504
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:35,993
It's not pathetic.

505
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:40,610
That's the most important
relationship in your life.

506
00:21:48,007 --> 00:21:49,940
The problem isn't

507
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:52,788
that I broke my promise.

508
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:54,052
That's not the problem.

509
00:21:56,232 --> 00:21:57,681
The problem is...

510
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:03,236
The problem is...

511
00:22:04,106 --> 00:22:06,123
That it felt good.

512
00:22:06,192 --> 00:22:07,692
It felt good.

513
00:22:09,812 --> 00:22:12,479
I shouldn't have
taken advantage.

514
00:22:12,548 --> 00:22:14,715
Taken advantage? What?

515
00:22:16,551 --> 00:22:18,319
We should go.

516
00:22:20,723 --> 00:22:22,389
Taken advantage?

517
00:22:23,626 --> 00:22:25,025
I kissed you, remember?

518
00:22:26,295 --> 00:22:29,330
Yeah, but I kissed you back.

519
00:22:29,398 --> 00:22:31,381
Yeah, but then I
unbuttoned your shirt.

520
00:22:34,136 --> 00:22:35,252
Yeah, and then I

521
00:22:36,356 --> 00:22:38,088
pulled up that skirt.

522
00:22:40,826 --> 00:22:43,107
Yeah, but then I
kissed your neck.

523
00:22:49,017 --> 00:22:52,619
Yeah. And then I
took off your shirt.

524
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:55,289
And I...

525
00:22:56,942 --> 00:22:59,643
But then I unbuckled your belt.

526
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:04,798
And then I slipped
my hand up your back.

527
00:23:04,867 --> 00:23:07,201
And I wrapped my
arms around your neck.

528
00:23:10,739 --> 00:23:12,605
And then I...

529
00:23:12,674 --> 00:23:13,890
Then you...

530
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:15,476
Then I...

531
00:23:37,233 --> 00:23:38,331
No. He's not gonna...

532
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,483
Yes, he is.

533
00:23:40,035 --> 00:23:41,267
No!

534
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:42,413
- Oh, my God.
- I told you.

535
00:23:42,437 --> 00:23:44,138
Disgusting.

536
00:23:44,206 --> 00:23:46,573
Dr. Bailey, where
are the candidates?

537
00:23:46,641 --> 00:23:48,309
Over there
destroying my appetite.

538
00:23:48,377 --> 00:23:49,971
You know, I never
thought I would've said this,

539
00:23:49,995 --> 00:23:52,713
but we need to keep
our people, people.

540
00:23:52,781 --> 00:23:53,959
Right?

541
00:23:53,983 --> 00:23:55,326
We haven't put
in all this training

542
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:56,895
and put up with
all their nonsense

543
00:23:56,919 --> 00:23:58,864
to go groveling at the
feet of bread sniffers.

544
00:23:58,888 --> 00:24:02,239
Kepner's already gotten job
offers at four different programs.

545
00:24:02,308 --> 00:24:04,241
Well, Grey's not going anywhere.

546
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:05,659
Not without Yang, anyway.

547
00:24:05,728 --> 00:24:08,678
Cristina has options.

548
00:24:08,747 --> 00:24:11,565
My contact in Boston
may have mentioned

549
00:24:11,633 --> 00:24:15,653
that Meredith said their
program's her first choice.

550
00:24:15,721 --> 00:24:17,454
You're building a house.

551
00:24:17,523 --> 00:24:20,791
Harvard has an excellent
neurosurgery department.

552
00:24:20,859 --> 00:24:23,727
And they have plenty
of really nice houses.

553
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:26,116
Don't be all cryptic
and then just walk away.

554
00:24:29,818 --> 00:24:30,901
Meredith?

555
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:32,536
<i>I lied to you.</i>

556
00:24:32,605 --> 00:24:33,687
About what?

557
00:24:33,756 --> 00:24:35,606
I'm not okay.

558
00:24:35,675 --> 00:24:37,486
I might be dying. I think
our daughter tried to kill me

559
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:39,354
<i>with her flu for
being a bad mother.</i>

560
00:24:39,378 --> 00:24:41,255
Why didn't you tell me before?

561
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,741
<i>I'm failing, Derek, and I don't
think I can go back in there.</i>

562
00:24:43,765 --> 00:24:45,882
I just can't. I mean...

563
00:24:48,521 --> 00:24:50,855
Will you still
love me if I fail?

564
00:24:50,923 --> 00:24:53,435
You want me to yell at you
or tell you to come home?

565
00:24:53,459 --> 00:24:55,699
I want you to tell
me what to do.

566
00:24:58,497 --> 00:24:59,796
The test is a mirror.

567
00:24:59,865 --> 00:25:01,042
What are you talking about?

568
00:25:01,066 --> 00:25:03,433
The test. It's a mirror.

569
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:06,336
Reflecting my
sickly incompetence?

570
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:14,511
Are you saying I won't like
myself if I give up right now?

571
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:16,525
That I won't be able to look
myself in the mirror if I quit?

572
00:25:16,549 --> 00:25:19,283
Whatever you decide,
I will still love you.

573
00:25:21,453 --> 00:25:23,465
No, you won't.
Nobody loves a quitter.

574
00:25:23,489 --> 00:25:24,788
Good luck, Meredith.

575
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:33,781
Huh.

576
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:38,913
You find out the
patient has advanced

577
00:25:38,937 --> 00:25:40,766
metastatic disease
and is terminal.

578
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:41,990
What do you do?

579
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:46,126
Honestly?

580
00:25:46,928 --> 00:25:48,879
I'd pray for them.

581
00:25:48,948 --> 00:25:52,632
I know that's not the right
answer, but it's what I'd do first.

582
00:25:52,701 --> 00:25:54,846
Or at least if you asked me
yesterday, that's what I'd do.

583
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:56,514
Now I'm not so
sure if he's listening.

584
00:25:56,538 --> 00:25:59,439
Dr. Kepner, this is
highly inappropriate.

585
00:25:59,508 --> 00:26:01,920
Yeah, well, so is having
premarital sex in the men's room

586
00:26:01,944 --> 00:26:04,784
with a really good friend,
but that just happened, so...

587
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:09,516
You know, I have been surrounded

588
00:26:09,584 --> 00:26:12,786
by scientists for a decade now,

589
00:26:12,855 --> 00:26:15,655
holding back my feelings
about my relationship with God,

590
00:26:15,724 --> 00:26:18,292
'cause I was afraid
of being laughed at,

591
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:21,528
or judged, or considered
less of a doctor.

592
00:26:24,033 --> 00:26:25,565
I was hiding.

593
00:26:26,969 --> 00:26:30,204
Ashamed to admit
that I love Him.

594
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:33,273
That His is the one
relationship I count on.

595
00:26:36,411 --> 00:26:39,179
And now I'm not sure
if I just screwed that up

596
00:26:39,248 --> 00:26:41,815
or freed myself
from its limitations.

597
00:26:44,586 --> 00:26:47,020
The one thing I
know for sure, though,

598
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:50,523
is I think I'm done hiding.

599
00:26:50,592 --> 00:26:53,992
Dr. Kepner, we
asked you a question.

600
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:58,232
Yes, I would do a palliative
endoscopic stenting.

601
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:01,535
If that failed and the patient
was still alive and having pain,

602
00:27:01,604 --> 00:27:03,815
I would do a biliary-enteric
bypass. After that, I might...

603
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:06,484
A 30-year-old female comes
in with third-degree burns.

604
00:27:06,508 --> 00:27:09,587
You've checked her airway
and started fluid resuscitation

605
00:27:09,611 --> 00:27:11,294
with D5NS fluids.

606
00:27:11,363 --> 00:27:13,914
Actually, I would use
LR for fluid resuscitation,

607
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,699
not NS.

608
00:27:15,767 --> 00:27:17,501
Saline has too much chloride,

609
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:19,449
and that could cause
acidosis in my patient.

610
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:22,005
Okay.

611
00:27:22,074 --> 00:27:25,909
So you've started your
patient on a liter of LR.

612
00:27:27,513 --> 00:27:29,680
Thanks for assisting, Bailey.

613
00:27:29,748 --> 00:27:32,916
You know, Nick did a big spread
in <i>National Geographic</i> once

614
00:27:32,968 --> 00:27:35,202
on this school for
orphan girls in Calcutta,

615
00:27:35,271 --> 00:27:37,087
and he sent them
a bunch of cameras.

616
00:27:37,156 --> 00:27:38,771
I think that it was Polaroids,

617
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:41,019
so they wouldn't have to pay
for the film to get processed.

618
00:27:41,043 --> 00:27:42,387
But, anyways, you know,
a couple of those girls

619
00:27:42,411 --> 00:27:44,311
actually became photographers.

620
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:46,780
Like professionals.
Isn't that amazing?

621
00:27:46,848 --> 00:27:49,215
We're not going
to kill your friend.

622
00:27:49,284 --> 00:27:51,819
What? I know. I'm just saying...

623
00:27:51,887 --> 00:27:53,865
Hey, does he save puppies, too?

624
00:27:53,889 --> 00:27:55,722
Less sarcasm. A
little more focus.

625
00:28:01,697 --> 00:28:02,979
Oh, shoot.

626
00:28:03,048 --> 00:28:05,326
We were supposed
to bring snack today

627
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,751
to the day care
for all the kids.

628
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:09,236
Today? Yeah.

629
00:28:09,305 --> 00:28:10,715
That mom from Psych asked
if we would switch with her,

630
00:28:10,739 --> 00:28:12,300
and I said we would,
and then I forgot.

631
00:28:12,324 --> 00:28:13,123
You need to write this
stuff down. I know. I know.

632
00:28:13,192 --> 00:28:14,432
I'm so sorry. Sorry.

633
00:28:14,476 --> 00:28:15,716
I... Sorry!

634
00:28:21,033 --> 00:28:22,832
You didn't forget
snack, did you?

635
00:28:24,736 --> 00:28:27,936
No, I'm seeing mets in
the vessels. Look at this.

636
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:30,890
Damn. And if they're here...

637
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:32,999
They're gonna be everywhere.

638
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,778
The temporalis
muscle is atrophied.

639
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:43,122
Any idea why, Dr. Grey?

640
00:28:43,222 --> 00:28:44,420
Lack of use?

641
00:28:44,489 --> 00:28:46,367
It had nowhere to attach
since the bone was gone.

642
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:48,503
That's right. It's too
late for this muscle.

643
00:28:48,527 --> 00:28:51,912
It's missed its
chance to attach.

644
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,448
Why are we talking
about the temporalis?

645
00:28:54,517 --> 00:28:57,901
Teachable moment,
Dr. Sloan. Stay out of it.

646
00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:02,222
Once you inject the fat into
Charlie's temple, the muscle will...

647
00:29:02,291 --> 00:29:04,191
Again with the muscle?

648
00:29:04,259 --> 00:29:09,480
Yeah, the once healthy muscle
will slowly wither to nothing all alone,

649
00:29:09,548 --> 00:29:12,866
surrounded by a
thick layer of fat.

650
00:29:14,469 --> 00:29:18,204
Mmm. Very crafty, Dr. Shepherd.

651
00:29:18,273 --> 00:29:19,489
Message received,

652
00:29:20,226 --> 00:29:21,725
loud and clear.

653
00:29:25,497 --> 00:29:27,030
They had snack.

654
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:30,500
And now I have two pounds
of strawberries for no reason.

655
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:33,186
Why is Teddy here?

656
00:29:33,255 --> 00:29:34,454
Honey,

657
00:29:34,523 --> 00:29:36,840
we did a PET scan,

658
00:29:36,909 --> 00:29:38,976
and Nick has intradural mets.

659
00:29:39,044 --> 00:29:41,089
They've spread
into his lymph nodes,

660
00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:42,713
they've even
gone into his heart.

661
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:46,082
He has a cardiac tumor,

662
00:29:46,152 --> 00:29:50,187
which looks like it might have
invaded into the right ventricle.

663
00:29:50,256 --> 00:29:53,590
At this point, there's
very little that we can do.

664
00:30:10,792 --> 00:30:13,793
I would be concerned
about Crohn's disease,

665
00:30:13,862 --> 00:30:16,446
but differential
diagnosis could be PUD,

666
00:30:16,515 --> 00:30:19,032
ulcerative colitis,
or appendicitis.

667
00:30:19,768 --> 00:30:21,351
Dr. Grey?

668
00:30:23,121 --> 00:30:24,905
I'm sorry. I can't...

669
00:30:29,678 --> 00:30:32,879
I'd locate the fistula
endoscopically, then inject fibrin glue.

670
00:30:32,948 --> 00:30:34,414
What about an abscess?

671
00:30:34,483 --> 00:30:36,550
What about it?

672
00:30:36,619 --> 00:30:39,620
Well, apparently,
you have ruled it out.

673
00:30:39,688 --> 00:30:42,800
It just feels a bit
cavalier, doesn't it?

674
00:30:42,824 --> 00:30:44,424
If you say so.

675
00:30:44,493 --> 00:30:46,225
I'm having a hard
time understanding

676
00:30:46,294 --> 00:30:48,723
why I would open her up when
I could treat it endoscopically.

677
00:30:48,747 --> 00:30:50,491
Precisely my question, Dr. Yang.

678
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:52,298
I've treated this
condition a dozen times.

679
00:30:52,367 --> 00:30:54,884
And I, 1,000 times.

680
00:30:58,824 --> 00:31:02,659
If you would rather I open her
up and do a tube duodenostomy,

681
00:31:02,728 --> 00:31:05,345
that's fine, too.

682
00:31:05,413 --> 00:31:07,380
It's more invasive, but fine.

683
00:31:07,449 --> 00:31:08,489
Mm-hmm.

684
00:31:15,073 --> 00:31:16,422
Dr. Grey.

685
00:31:16,491 --> 00:31:19,091
Dr. Grey, we're
gonna have to call this.

686
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:21,261
You can take the
exam again next year.

687
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:23,863
And we won't count this
as a failure, so, please...

688
00:31:23,932 --> 00:31:26,410
Okay, you're doctors. You
can't handle a little vomit?

689
00:31:26,434 --> 00:31:28,045
Dr. Grey, it's really okay...

690
00:31:28,069 --> 00:31:29,814
I would repair it with
an abdominal approach,

691
00:31:29,838 --> 00:31:32,322
reduce the size of
the hernia contents,

692
00:31:32,391 --> 00:31:34,791
excise the sac,
close the hiatus,

693
00:31:34,843 --> 00:31:38,361
and perform a floppy Nissen
for anti-reflux and gastropexy.

694
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:39,858
But ask me something else,

695
00:31:39,882 --> 00:31:42,176
because I've known that answer
since I was, like, 12 years old.

696
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,412
My mother practically
invented the floppy Nissen.

697
00:31:44,436 --> 00:31:48,404
So keep them coming,
but don't go easy on me.

698
00:31:48,473 --> 00:31:52,158
All right. A 40-year-old man
presents with a suspicious lesion

699
00:31:52,227 --> 00:31:54,878
on his left temporal,
sent in by his...

700
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,133
Ooh!

701
00:32:00,201 --> 00:32:01,868
Pigmented lesion?

702
00:32:01,937 --> 00:32:05,021
You seem awfully
sure of yourself.

703
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:06,283
I'm sorry. Is that a question?

704
00:32:06,307 --> 00:32:07,452
Do you feel threatened?

705
00:32:07,476 --> 00:32:08,786
Have we moved on to psychology?

706
00:32:08,810 --> 00:32:10,888
I find your hostility curious.

707
00:32:10,912 --> 00:32:12,840
And I'm curious as to
why you think me hostile.

708
00:32:12,864 --> 00:32:14,743
You know, if you don't
agree with my approach,

709
00:32:14,767 --> 00:32:17,200
I wish you would
voice your issues.

710
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:19,068
I don't disagree.

711
00:32:19,137 --> 00:32:21,121
I don't believe you.

712
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:23,206
Are you calling me a liar, sir?

713
00:32:29,681 --> 00:32:31,481
Fine. You know what?

714
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:34,117
Earlier, when I said I was
okay with that open procedure,

715
00:32:34,186 --> 00:32:35,485
I wasn't.

716
00:32:35,554 --> 00:32:37,132
That might have
been okay when, like,

717
00:32:37,156 --> 00:32:39,072
Hawkeye and BJ did it on <i>MASH,</i>

718
00:32:39,141 --> 00:32:40,841
but this being the
new century and all,

719
00:32:40,909 --> 00:32:44,060
I would have, as I said
earlier, treated it endoscopically.

720
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:45,395
Then you lied earlier.

721
00:32:45,447 --> 00:32:47,914
You know what? Oh, God. I
can answer these questions

722
00:32:47,982 --> 00:32:50,884
any way you want using
medical techniques from any era.

723
00:32:50,953 --> 00:32:52,686
So how about we just, you know,

724
00:32:52,754 --> 00:32:55,655
pick a decade you're comfortable
with and go from there?

725
00:32:58,026 --> 00:32:59,793
Well, then...

726
00:32:59,861 --> 00:33:02,622
It's been a pleasure being
witness to such genius.

727
00:33:03,598 --> 00:33:05,126
I can now finally retire

728
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:08,051
knowing that such
advanced and creative minds

729
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:11,020
are at work in
the surgical field.

730
00:33:12,574 --> 00:33:14,040
That's it?

731
00:33:14,109 --> 00:33:17,411
I think we've had enough of
an education today, Dr. Yang.

732
00:33:18,763 --> 00:33:21,464
But there's still 20 minutes.

733
00:33:21,533 --> 00:33:22,613
No need.

734
00:33:24,486 --> 00:33:25,718
Oh.

735
00:33:25,788 --> 00:33:27,120
Best of luck.

736
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:33,743
I'd do a biopsy.

737
00:33:33,811 --> 00:33:36,946
Path shows LCIS. What's your
best mastectomy approach?

738
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:38,692
I'd make a periareolar incision

739
00:33:38,716 --> 00:33:40,756
to preserve the
inframammary fold.

740
00:33:42,170 --> 00:33:44,921
But wait. Did you say LCIS?

741
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:47,073
Yes, lobular carcinoma in situ.

742
00:33:47,142 --> 00:33:48,319
You wouldn't do a mastectomy.

743
00:33:48,343 --> 00:33:49,720
You'd observe and repeat mammos.

744
00:33:49,744 --> 00:33:51,961
You already did a
skin-sparing mastectomy.

745
00:33:53,065 --> 00:33:54,308
That was a trick question.

746
00:33:54,332 --> 00:33:56,277
You had all the facts to answer.

747
00:33:56,301 --> 00:33:57,611
Yeah, but my answer was wrong.

748
00:33:57,635 --> 00:34:00,048
I'm gonna fail because
of a trick question?

749
00:34:00,072 --> 00:34:02,172
The questions are designed
to get your response...

750
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,334
You got to be kidding me?

751
00:34:03,358 --> 00:34:04,535
You missed your first session.

752
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:06,543
You're lucky to be
even getting this chance.

753
00:34:06,611 --> 00:34:09,629
Yeah, I missed my first session
for the best freakin' reason.

754
00:34:09,698 --> 00:34:11,481
I was with a patient.

755
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:14,128
For months with this kid
who doesn't have a chance.

756
00:34:14,152 --> 00:34:15,618
Not a chance.

757
00:34:15,687 --> 00:34:18,287
And we give them a
chance and we try everything,

758
00:34:18,356 --> 00:34:20,168
and then when there's
nothing left to do,

759
00:34:20,192 --> 00:34:23,654
I'm supposed to just walk
away from his mother?

760
00:34:23,678 --> 00:34:26,730
I had to be there. I had to.

761
00:34:26,798 --> 00:34:28,509
And what did I miss here, a few

762
00:34:28,533 --> 00:34:30,973
more hypothetical
trick questions?

763
00:34:31,336 --> 00:34:33,514
What are you staring at?

764
00:34:33,538 --> 00:34:34,949
You guys are doctors.

765
00:34:34,973 --> 00:34:37,085
You're supposed to decide
if I'm gonna be a doctor,

766
00:34:37,109 --> 00:34:38,853
and you can't understand that?

767
00:34:38,877 --> 00:34:40,997
Thank you,
Dr. Karev. It's Karev.

768
00:34:43,215 --> 00:34:45,535
Can you at least
tell me if I passed?

769
00:35:13,978 --> 00:35:15,938
Thank you. Thank you.

770
00:35:16,548 --> 00:35:17,747
Taxi.

771
00:35:23,321 --> 00:35:24,932
Well, you don't want
to miss your flight.

772
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:28,191
No, I don't want to miss
my flight. I better go.

773
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:36,733
Richard, I don't
regret last night one bit.

774
00:35:36,802 --> 00:35:38,868
Neither do I.

775
00:35:39,654 --> 00:35:41,120
It's just bad timing.

776
00:35:41,189 --> 00:35:44,324
You know, we live
in different cities.

777
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:45,703
It's too complicated right now.

778
00:35:45,727 --> 00:35:46,959
Yeah, bad timing.

779
00:35:48,012 --> 00:35:49,479
Bye, Richard.

780
00:35:49,548 --> 00:35:51,842
Bye, Catherine. Safe flight.

781
00:35:51,866 --> 00:35:54,195
Call me if you hear
anymore about the boards.

782
00:35:54,219 --> 00:35:55,863
I will. And call me
when you get home,

783
00:35:55,887 --> 00:35:57,565
let me know you got there okay.

784
00:35:57,589 --> 00:35:59,188
I will.

785
00:35:59,257 --> 00:36:04,744
Are you going to the trauma and
critical care conference in May?

786
00:36:04,813 --> 00:36:06,646
In New Orleans?

787
00:36:06,714 --> 00:36:07,941
I'm speaking at it.

788
00:36:07,965 --> 00:36:09,466
Me, too.

789
00:36:09,534 --> 00:36:12,102
I'm at the Soniat House.
Where are they putting you up?

790
00:36:13,488 --> 00:36:14,721
Uh...

791
00:36:15,707 --> 00:36:17,106
Windsor Court.

792
00:36:17,158 --> 00:36:18,825
No. Soniat House is much better.

793
00:36:18,893 --> 00:36:21,494
The breakfast biscuits will
make you jump up and down.

794
00:36:23,065 --> 00:36:25,531
When do you fly in?

795
00:36:25,601 --> 00:36:27,433
I think it's Thursday.

796
00:36:27,502 --> 00:36:29,168
I fly in Thursday, too.

797
00:36:33,041 --> 00:36:34,624
I can't believe it.

798
00:36:34,693 --> 00:36:36,943
My whole Charlie is back.

799
00:36:37,012 --> 00:36:39,145
You people are miracle workers.

800
00:36:39,214 --> 00:36:41,798
So how long till I'm
back on the ladder?

801
00:36:41,867 --> 00:36:44,562
I just got a tile saw and I'm
gonna mosaic the stucco.

802
00:36:44,586 --> 00:36:48,271
You can't... Dr. Shepherd,
talk some sense into him.

803
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:49,984
It's really not my place.

804
00:36:50,008 --> 00:36:51,603
But if you want to say
something to your husband,

805
00:36:51,627 --> 00:36:53,827
please, by all means,
you should do it.

806
00:36:53,895 --> 00:36:56,629
I know how much you
love to work on the house,

807
00:36:56,698 --> 00:36:59,632
but listen to me,
you are clumsy.

808
00:36:59,701 --> 00:37:02,434
And I can't stand the thought
of almost losing you again.

809
00:37:02,503 --> 00:37:04,620
So would you just take a second,

810
00:37:04,689 --> 00:37:09,259
and what's left of your brain,
and think about how I felt about it?

811
00:37:09,328 --> 00:37:11,560
How scared I was
to lose you forever?

812
00:37:16,401 --> 00:37:19,202
You're right. I'm sorry, babe.

813
00:37:19,271 --> 00:37:21,688
I'll find a new hobby.

814
00:37:21,756 --> 00:37:24,702
Right? Something we can
do together, like, bowling.

815
00:37:24,726 --> 00:37:27,293
No, I hate bowling.

816
00:37:27,362 --> 00:37:28,506
But you never even tried it.

817
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:31,291
Well, you can hate
something without trying it.

818
00:37:37,305 --> 00:37:38,404
Hey.

819
00:37:38,473 --> 00:37:39,505
Hey.

820
00:37:40,274 --> 00:37:42,608
Thanks for today.

821
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:44,577
For letting me...

822
00:37:44,646 --> 00:37:45,895
You did a good job in there.

823
00:37:45,964 --> 00:37:47,196
Thanks.

824
00:37:49,283 --> 00:37:50,383
You okay?

825
00:37:50,451 --> 00:37:52,368
I love you.

826
00:37:52,437 --> 00:37:54,920
Oh, my God. That just came

827
00:37:54,989 --> 00:37:58,157
flying out of my face,
like it was some kind of...

828
00:37:58,226 --> 00:38:01,911
I love you. I just... God.

829
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:04,347
Did it again.

830
00:38:04,416 --> 00:38:08,518
I love you. I do. I
just... I love you.

831
00:38:08,587 --> 00:38:10,698
And I have been
trying not to say it.

832
00:38:10,722 --> 00:38:13,468
I have been trying so
hard to just mash it down

833
00:38:13,492 --> 00:38:15,812
and ignore it and not say it.

834
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:18,228
And Jackson is a great guy.

835
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:22,432
He is, and he's gorgeous,
and he's younger than you,

836
00:38:22,501 --> 00:38:24,378
and he doesn't
have any grandkids

837
00:38:24,402 --> 00:38:26,230
or babies with his lesbian BFFs,

838
00:38:26,254 --> 00:38:29,672
and he's an Avery, and
he liked me, you know?

839
00:38:30,274 --> 00:38:32,208
He really liked me.

840
00:38:32,276 --> 00:38:33,854
But it was never gonna work out,

841
00:38:33,878 --> 00:38:37,013
because I love you.

842
00:38:37,082 --> 00:38:39,466
I am so in love with you.

843
00:38:39,534 --> 00:38:42,668
And you're in me.

844
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:45,538
It's like you're a disease.

845
00:38:45,607 --> 00:38:48,141
It's like I am infected
by Mark Sloan.

846
00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:49,809
And I just can't...

847
00:38:49,877 --> 00:38:53,045
I can't think about
anything or anybody,

848
00:38:53,115 --> 00:38:55,047
and I can't sleep.

849
00:38:55,883 --> 00:38:57,684
I can't breathe.

850
00:38:57,752 --> 00:38:59,335
I can't eat.

851
00:38:59,404 --> 00:39:01,716
And I love you. I just...
I love you all the time.

852
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:04,100
Every minute of every day.

853
00:39:04,142 --> 00:39:06,159
And I...

854
00:39:06,227 --> 00:39:07,359
I...

855
00:39:08,362 --> 00:39:10,396
Love you.

856
00:39:12,466 --> 00:39:15,034
God, that feels
good, just to say that.

857
00:39:16,370 --> 00:39:19,455
I feel so much better.
Just... I love you.

858
00:39:21,526 --> 00:39:22,792
Mark?

859
00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:25,211
Hey, Lexie.

860
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,413
I thought you said
the lobby. You ready?

861
00:39:39,527 --> 00:39:41,293
Hey there, sunshine.

862
00:39:41,996 --> 00:39:43,228
You feeling okay?

863
00:39:43,297 --> 00:39:46,298
Yeah. You know, just groggy.

864
00:39:46,367 --> 00:39:48,167
You guys got good
drugs in this place.

865
00:39:48,235 --> 00:39:50,736
Good. What the hell
were you thinking?

866
00:39:50,806 --> 00:39:52,366
Dude. You're an idiot.

867
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,624
You should have called me.

868
00:39:54,692 --> 00:39:56,854
I mean, why didn't you
call me? I'm a doctor.

869
00:39:56,878 --> 00:39:58,755
What do you think
I do all day long?

870
00:39:58,779 --> 00:40:00,457
Instead, you go to
some quack in Tibet.

871
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:01,758
I mean, you should've
freakin' called me!

872
00:40:01,782 --> 00:40:03,850
Naturopathy
works, too, Flagstaff.

873
00:40:03,918 --> 00:40:05,696
Whoa. It's not Flagstaff!

874
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,264
And it's not Phoenix
and it's not Tempe!

875
00:40:07,288 --> 00:40:08,604
It's Arizona Robbins, MD.

876
00:40:08,673 --> 00:40:09,884
Do you know what that means?

877
00:40:09,908 --> 00:40:11,618
How do you spell
it? It's not funny, Nick.

878
00:40:11,642 --> 00:40:13,487
Nothing is funny. You're dying!

879
00:40:13,511 --> 00:40:15,690
And you know what
hell it was when Tim died

880
00:40:15,714 --> 00:40:17,175
because you were there,

881
00:40:17,199 --> 00:40:18,643
and you and I barely
made it through that.

882
00:40:18,667 --> 00:40:20,811
So to do nothing for six years

883
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:22,346
and then to come
when it's too late,

884
00:40:22,370 --> 00:40:24,203
I...

885
00:40:24,289 --> 00:40:26,823
Why do you think I didn't
come to you sooner?

886
00:40:29,594 --> 00:40:31,443
As if after Tim died, I could...

887
00:40:34,348 --> 00:40:37,483
You think I don't know
how this must feel for you?

888
00:40:37,552 --> 00:40:38,779
You're an idiot!

889
00:40:38,803 --> 00:40:41,837
I couldn't have helped Tim,
but I could've helped you!

890
00:40:52,383 --> 00:40:54,684
<i>I'll admit, the
Romans had a point.</i>

891
00:40:56,888 --> 00:40:58,521
<i>You got to live life.</i>

892
00:40:59,924 --> 00:41:01,284
Got to pee. Got
to pee. Got to pee.

893
00:41:02,277 --> 00:41:03,354
What time you got?

894
00:41:03,378 --> 00:41:04,643
12:04.

895
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:06,340
It's supposed to come
online at midnight.

896
00:41:06,364 --> 00:41:08,742
I mean, it's four minutes
late. Come on, people.

897
00:41:08,766 --> 00:41:11,134
Crazy doctors, they
crashed the system.

898
00:41:11,202 --> 00:41:13,018
I already know I failed,

899
00:41:13,088 --> 00:41:15,208
so I don't know why I keep
hitting the refresh button.

900
00:41:16,257 --> 00:41:18,035
<i>And living means that every
morning, when you wake up,</i>

901
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:19,659
<i>you have to choose...</i>

902
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:22,039
Okay, if anyone failed, it was me,
because my guy had a vendetta.

903
00:41:22,063 --> 00:41:23,707
Please. I've got
the odds on failure.

904
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:25,676
Are any of you on
call? I've got a trauma.

905
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:26,883
No!

906
00:41:27,752 --> 00:41:29,252
Wait. Wait. Wait.

907
00:41:30,722 --> 00:41:31,962
I passed. I passed.

908
00:41:32,023 --> 00:41:34,090
I passed! I passed!
I passed! Yes!

909
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:35,786
I passed! I passed!
Oh, my God! Yeah!

910
00:41:35,810 --> 00:41:38,627
<i>Between seizing what
life offers in the moment,</i>

911
00:41:38,697 --> 00:41:41,564
<i>and forging ahead,
no matter the weather...</i>

912
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:43,499
Alex? It's not coming up.

913
00:41:43,568 --> 00:41:45,648
Here, here. Use mine.

914
00:42:00,018 --> 00:42:02,151
Wait. Wait. Where is April?

915
00:42:03,554 --> 00:42:05,171
<i>Or closing the curtains...</i>

916
00:42:11,813 --> 00:42:14,447
<i>and shutting out the day.</i>
