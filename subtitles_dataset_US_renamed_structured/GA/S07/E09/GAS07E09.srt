1
00:00:04,171 --> 00:00:06,472
<i>We doctors take
pride in the fact</i>

2
00:00:06,573 --> 00:00:09,308
<i>that we can basically
sleep standing up...</i>

3
00:00:11,445 --> 00:00:13,312
<i>anytime, anywhere.</i>

4
00:00:19,953 --> 00:00:21,381
Jackson.

5
00:00:21,405 --> 00:00:22,954
Stop!

6
00:00:23,757 --> 00:00:25,307
Stop! Hey, hey, Jackson!

7
00:00:25,409 --> 00:00:27,759
- What?
- Stop. Stop. I'm sorry.

8
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:30,795
- But you need
to take something.
- Where's Charles? Charles!

9
00:00:31,498 --> 00:00:32,697
Where's Charles?

10
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:35,450
Hey. Hey, hey! Stop.

11
00:00:35,552 --> 00:00:36,919
It's Lexie. Wake up.

12
00:00:44,478 --> 00:00:46,995
- It's time for work.
- Yeah, just about.

13
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:52,767
<i>But it's a false pride
because the truth is...</i>

14
00:00:52,869 --> 00:00:55,537
<i>after about 20
hours without sleep...</i>

15
00:00:56,873 --> 00:01:01,559
<i>you might as well just come
to work drunk, doctor or not.</i>

16
00:01:01,661 --> 00:01:06,815
<i>So it's no wonder that fatal
medical errors increase at night,</i>

17
00:01:06,917 --> 00:01:08,617
<i>when we doctors are,</i>

18
00:01:08,718 --> 00:01:11,953
<i>proudly, sleeping on our feet.</i>

19
00:01:15,476 --> 00:01:19,111
<i>Recently, our communal
pride has been shattered</i>

20
00:01:19,196 --> 00:01:22,314
<i>and our egos have been
wounded by new laws...</i>

21
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:26,184
- Hey.
<i>- That require - that we sleep all day</i>

22
00:01:26,287 --> 00:01:29,103
<i>- before we work all night.</i>
- Oh! Dr. Shepherd!

23
00:01:29,206 --> 00:01:31,326
There's French toast and
coffee if you want breakfast.

24
00:01:31,375 --> 00:01:34,726
- It's 6pm.
- Right. Uh... Bacon for your dinner?

25
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:36,068
Thank you, no.

26
00:01:36,097 --> 00:01:38,613
<i>We're not happy about it.</i>

27
00:01:38,715 --> 00:01:41,566
<i>But as someone who may
one day need medical care,</i>

28
00:01:42,636 --> 00:01:44,236
<i>you really should be.</i>

29
00:01:44,338 --> 00:01:46,004
It's<i> Night of the
Living Dead</i> out there.

30
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:47,701
I'm still sleeping.

31
00:01:47,725 --> 00:01:49,691
A whole day happened
while you were sleeping.

32
00:01:49,793 --> 00:01:52,877
Let's see, I did three
aneurysm surgeries,

33
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:56,381
I consulted on a massive
spinal tumor, that was neat.

34
00:01:56,483 --> 00:01:58,283
Got the Phillips grant,
and oh, by the way,

35
00:01:58,385 --> 00:02:01,552
the, uh, soup of the day in the
cafeteria was potato-leek soup.

36
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:04,689
- You got the grant?
- Yeah, I got the grant.

37
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:07,003
- You got the Alzheimer's grant?
- Yeah, I got it!

38
00:02:08,278 --> 00:02:10,829
Mark is putting together
a little celebration at Joe's.

39
00:02:10,931 --> 00:02:14,266
But I would much rather
celebrate here with you. Mm!

40
00:02:14,368 --> 00:02:17,318
I am late for work.
Gotta love the night shift.

41
00:02:18,188 --> 00:02:19,972
- Proud of you.
- Thank you.

42
00:02:31,635 --> 00:02:35,203
- Nice face.
- At least I can do surgery.

43
00:02:35,305 --> 00:02:37,116
- How's that hand?
- It would be better

44
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,884
if you hadn't run
your face into it.

45
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:40,303
So he beats the hell out of you

46
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:41,554
and now you're
laughing about it?

47
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:43,478
Eh, some of us can move on.

48
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,380
You're sitting on my coat.

49
00:02:45,482 --> 00:02:47,131
And some of us can't.

50
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:52,437
Did you just yawn?
Was that a yawn?

51
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:55,073
Don't tell us you're tired
after getting to sleep all day.

52
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:58,126
- It's not as easy as it sounds.
- Not easy? Not...

53
00:02:58,228 --> 00:03:00,995
When I was a resident, I
actually worked for a living.

54
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:03,315
I did every other
night call for five years.

55
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:07,019
There were days I didn't go
home for 72 hours. I loved it.

56
00:03:07,121 --> 00:03:11,055
As you trudged through the snow
while you whittled your own scalpels.

57
00:03:11,157 --> 00:03:13,942
Sorry, I didn't quite
catch that, Karev.

58
00:03:14,044 --> 00:03:17,362
Uh, Karev, I need you to
follow up on my post-ops,

59
00:03:17,464 --> 00:03:20,794
and here, take this research,
divide out all the fistula cases.

60
00:03:20,818 --> 00:03:23,480
Avery and Little Grey, Hunt
is waiting for you in the pit.

61
00:03:23,504 --> 00:03:26,788
All right. Try not to screw
up our patients. Good night.

62
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:29,018
- And good luck.
- - We'll be over at the bar.

63
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:32,193
- Try not to need us.
- Dr. Grey. Shepherd's wife.

64
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:34,073
- You're with me tonight.
- Yes.

65
00:03:34,097 --> 00:03:36,982
Good. I heard you're good.
Listen, I'm late for dinner.

66
00:03:37,084 --> 00:03:39,484
So, um, I made a list of
my patients, their protocols.

67
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:42,420
Basically, everybody's stable.
Just try and keep them that way.

68
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:44,734
And if I need to get
in touch with you, sir?

69
00:03:44,758 --> 00:03:47,191
You won't. 'Cause you're good.

70
00:03:49,346 --> 00:03:51,496
Nice to meet you.

71
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:55,483
Everybody else is stable. Watch ICU
bed 12, he may need to be intubated.

72
00:03:55,585 --> 00:03:58,503
And call me if there are
any major traumas. Avery?

73
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,877
- How you feeling?
- What, my hand? It's fine.

74
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:08,524
- Just a little bruised.
- I'm not talking
about your hand.

75
00:04:08,548 --> 00:04:11,433
Trauma demands a cool
head. If you're not up to this...

76
00:04:11,535 --> 00:04:16,504
No, I'm good. Thanks. Karev
and I are cool, that's, uh... over.

77
00:04:16,606 --> 00:04:19,252
- Out of my system.
- - You don't have to prove anything here.

78
00:04:19,276 --> 00:04:22,094
- If you need
a couple shifts off...
- I said I'm good, sir.

79
00:04:23,446 --> 00:04:27,783
All right. I'm... I'm not
asking you to talk to me.

80
00:04:27,885 --> 00:04:31,619
I'm telling you,
talk to someone.

81
00:04:32,388 --> 00:04:33,538
You got me?

82
00:04:34,308 --> 00:04:35,588
Have a good night, sir.

83
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:46,395
There's the man of the
hour. Congratulations.

84
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:48,887
Thank you very much. Thank you.

85
00:04:48,989 --> 00:04:52,090
First round is on me...

86
00:04:52,192 --> 00:04:54,159
Um, guys...

87
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:01,783
- There.
- Yeah. No, try again.

88
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:05,470
You need to tilt the
glass like I said. Tilt...

89
00:05:05,572 --> 00:05:07,955
- I'm tilting it!
- I know...

90
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:10,124
- Let me try again, OK?
- All right.

91
00:05:10,994 --> 00:05:12,326
Why are you behind the bar?

92
00:05:12,428 --> 00:05:16,030
Uh, Owen told me to
get a job. So I'm working.

93
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:20,318
What's everyone drinking?

94
00:05:30,313 --> 00:05:33,777
She sat on the sofa for three
days straight watching infomercials

95
00:05:33,801 --> 00:05:37,313
and eating cereal out of the box.
So yeah, I told her to get a job.

96
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:38,481
But you didn't
specify what kind?

97
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:39,915
I thought she'd go to a lab

98
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:42,156
or the morgue. I
didn't expect this.

99
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:43,592
Tell her you changed your mind.

100
00:05:43,694 --> 00:05:45,605
Tell her she can be a
housewife for all you care.

101
00:05:45,629 --> 00:05:48,558
I think that the only thing she'd
be worse at than bartending

102
00:05:48,582 --> 00:05:51,232
- is housewife-ing.
- What's so bad
about bartending?

103
00:05:51,335 --> 00:05:54,736
- She's not dancing on a pole.
- I give this one night.

104
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:59,691
And this Cristina Yang of Beverly
Hills? She does not enjoy serving people.

105
00:05:59,793 --> 00:06:02,143
All right!

106
00:06:02,245 --> 00:06:05,313
I call this the Early
Onset Alzheimer's.

107
00:06:05,415 --> 00:06:08,233
Because you won't remember
anything after you drink it.

108
00:06:08,335 --> 00:06:10,518
Mm!

109
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:14,506
To Shepherd and
his genius brain crap.

110
00:06:14,608 --> 00:06:16,448
- To Shepherd!
- To Shepherd!

111
00:06:18,929 --> 00:06:21,295
Oh! Oh, my God, this is strong.

112
00:06:21,415 --> 00:06:23,231
Ugh!

113
00:06:24,334 --> 00:06:25,928
- Yeah, I'm gonna need a Scotch.
- Make it two.

114
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:28,904
- Babies.
- - Early Onset Alzheimer's?

115
00:06:29,006 --> 00:06:30,450
You don't think that's
a little distasteful?

116
00:06:30,474 --> 00:06:33,174
- I think it's delicious.
- Cristina...

117
00:06:33,276 --> 00:06:36,644
- Um, you want a beer?
- No, I'm on call. I want to talk.

118
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:39,146
A bachelor party just
came in. Uh... We'll talk later.

119
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:41,994
- Hi!
- Yes!

120
00:06:42,018 --> 00:06:44,502
Is someone getting married?
Who's getting married?

121
00:06:49,476 --> 00:06:52,410
- He said, "Any major traumas."
- We are not calling Hunt.

122
00:06:52,512 --> 00:06:54,791
- We don't even know
what this is yet.
- ER's swamped. We had to split

123
00:06:54,815 --> 00:06:56,726
- Trauma Three,
put them both in there.
- Did you call Dr. Hunt?

124
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:01,102
- We're not calling Hunt.
- On my count. Ready, one, two, three.

125
00:07:03,407 --> 00:07:06,090
- Reilly, you OK?
- Lucas? It hurts.

126
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:08,677
- It hurts really bad.
- You'll be OK, Ri. All right?

127
00:07:08,778 --> 00:07:10,562
- We'll be OK.
- What've we got?

128
00:07:10,664 --> 00:07:12,875
Car versus train. Two
brothers, 17 and 15,

129
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:16,059
tried to outrun the Coast
Starlight to Portland. The train won.

130
00:07:16,152 --> 00:07:19,004
I know, it was stupid, it was
so stupid. I'll never do it again.

131
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:22,908
The driver was inside the car, the
other was thrown out. No seatbelt.

132
00:07:26,346 --> 00:07:28,463
Dr. Avery, come
take a look at this.

133
00:07:30,466 --> 00:07:31,783
Yeah.

134
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:47,915
Call Hunt.

135
00:07:55,074 --> 00:07:59,777
Mrs. McNeil? I'm Dr. Grey. I'll
be taking over for Dr. Stark tonight.

136
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:01,040
Drew's in a lot of pain.

137
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:02,396
OK, well, that's not unusual

138
00:08:02,498 --> 00:08:03,848
for this type of chest surgery.

139
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:06,835
Abdominal pain is not normal
after pectus excavatum surgery.

140
00:08:06,937 --> 00:08:10,205
And it's been going on for two
hours. I'm a nurse at Seattle Pres.

141
00:08:10,307 --> 00:08:13,058
It's OK, Drew, honey.
Mommy's right here.

142
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,159
His abdomen does
seem a little tender.

143
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:16,589
I'm concerned about his vitals.

144
00:08:16,613 --> 00:08:18,746
And I know my son.
He's not a complainer.

145
00:08:18,848 --> 00:08:20,398
Something is wrong.

146
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,568
- Can you please call Dr. Stark?
- I will. I'll call him right away.

147
00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:35,346
You're back already? That date
wasn't even like, what, an hour?

148
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:38,016
- I need a drink.
- Careful...

149
00:08:38,118 --> 00:08:40,802
Hey! That was mine! Now you
have to order me another one.

150
00:08:40,904 --> 00:08:43,738
Oh, God, that's disgusting.
Right. OK. So get this.

151
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,107
His very first question? "So,
what's your favorite food?"

152
00:08:46,209 --> 00:08:48,759
- What'd you say?
- French. But that's not the point.

153
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:51,729
Why would he ask me
what my favorite food was?

154
00:08:51,815 --> 00:08:54,177
Like he read that's
some good ice-breaker

155
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:58,219
from some Internet handbook that
was handed out at the loser fair. Ugh!

156
00:08:58,321 --> 00:08:59,715
This is why you don't
meet people on the Internet.

157
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:02,190
You're married. You
don't get to have an opinion

158
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:04,732
about my pathetic
forays into Internet dating.

159
00:09:04,811 --> 00:09:07,328
- You do need a drink.
- Thank you.

160
00:09:11,701 --> 00:09:14,635
- Go to Africa.
- What?

161
00:09:14,737 --> 00:09:17,217
Arizona's an idiot.
And she's a fool,

162
00:09:17,257 --> 00:09:21,292
and you need to go there
and tell her that I told you to say

163
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:23,711
that dating is evil,

164
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:27,348
and that what the two of you
have is rare and that she's an idiot!

165
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:29,850
Get on an airplane
and go to Africa

166
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,932
and thank God that you never
have to go on a first date again.

167
00:09:32,956 --> 00:09:34,371
Yeah, I'm not going to Africa.

168
00:09:34,474 --> 00:09:36,552
Well, then you're just
as big an idiot as she is.

169
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,621
- Oh.
- - Torres is a grown woman.

170
00:09:38,645 --> 00:09:40,339
You can't make her do
something she doesn't want to do.

171
00:09:40,363 --> 00:09:43,631
OK, again, Mr. Perfect
Married Guy,

172
00:09:43,734 --> 00:09:46,379
you don't get to
open your mouth...

173
00:09:46,403 --> 00:09:49,487
One, two...

174
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:51,956
Chug, chug, chug!
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!

175
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:56,311
Who's first?! Oh, groom!

176
00:09:56,413 --> 00:09:58,246
What the hell did I miss?

177
00:10:02,485 --> 00:10:05,653
You guys Super Glued
yourselves together on purpose?

178
00:10:05,755 --> 00:10:09,674
Apparently, my son and girlfriend's
love is so great, they can't hear you.

179
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:12,794
Yes, they Super Glued their arms
and hands together on purpose.

180
00:10:12,896 --> 00:10:16,881
- Uh, why would they...?
- We're moving
to Wisconsin tomorrow.

181
00:10:16,984 --> 00:10:18,861
No, you're moving, Dad.
I'm staying here with Lauren.

182
00:10:18,885 --> 00:10:21,635
No, you're not. You're
going to Wisconsin with me

183
00:10:21,738 --> 00:10:22,965
and your mom and
the dog and the cat.

184
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:24,972
No. Not without Lauren, I'm not.

185
00:10:25,075 --> 00:10:26,669
Nobody can tear us
apart, Mr. Nystrom.

186
00:10:26,693 --> 00:10:28,910
I know that, Lauren,
but the doctor here

187
00:10:29,012 --> 00:10:33,114
- is still gonna give it a try.
- - I wish we could glue our lips together forever.

188
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:34,883
Me, too.

189
00:10:36,336 --> 00:10:39,103
I... I will figure
something out.

190
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:42,073
Thank you.

191
00:10:54,121 --> 00:10:56,888
Have you ever had the
tiramisu at Gino's Trattoria?

192
00:10:56,973 --> 00:11:00,407
- Excuse me?
- Tiramisu, Gino's Trattoria.

193
00:11:00,509 --> 00:11:02,226
Uh, ladyfingers soaked in rum.

194
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:05,363
- No, I haven't.
- Neither have I.

195
00:11:05,465 --> 00:11:08,649
Because you felt the need to
drag me away from my dinner

196
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:12,470
- to examine a kid with gas.
- Gas? I thought...

197
00:11:12,572 --> 00:11:15,732
Uh, when I called you, he was in a lot
of pain and his vitals were borderline.

198
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:18,520
They're better now because I
gave him a liter bolus of IV fluids

199
00:11:18,544 --> 00:11:21,012
at 20 cc's per
kilo, but his pain...

200
00:11:21,114 --> 00:11:24,448
And yet, what you should have
given him was an anti-flatulent.

201
00:11:24,551 --> 00:11:29,220
Abdominal pain after chest wall surgery
in a patient on narcotic pain killers

202
00:11:29,322 --> 00:11:35,560
is gas or constipation
until proven otherwise.

203
00:11:35,662 --> 00:11:39,380
- But Dr. Stark,
what if his pain...?
- Tiramisu.

204
00:11:41,334 --> 00:11:44,985
- Avery, what do you have?
- Large gaping wound
to the abdomen.

205
00:11:45,087 --> 00:11:47,516
Looks like something sliced
right through him, debris inside.

206
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,518
- We need to get in there.
- Book an OR!

207
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:52,026
Reilly? Reilly, talk to me!

208
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:54,674
Reilly can't talk right now, OK,
buddy? He's got a tube in his throat

209
00:11:54,698 --> 00:11:59,217
- to help him breathe.
- Reilly, I'm right here! All right?

210
00:11:59,319 --> 00:12:02,103
Put more pressure on that.
Lean in there. Pack it, pack it!

211
00:12:02,205 --> 00:12:06,474
We were gonna be late,
so I ran it. Funny, right?

212
00:12:06,576 --> 00:12:08,926
We didn't want to get
in trouble with Mom.

213
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:12,046
So I... I go back to school,

214
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:14,866
picking him up after band
practice. We're halfway home,

215
00:12:14,968 --> 00:12:17,935
he forgets his stupid saxophone.

216
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:21,439
Two hundred. Clear.

217
00:12:23,876 --> 00:12:26,711
- He forgets everything!
- Three hundred.

218
00:12:26,813 --> 00:12:29,047
- Everything!
- Clear.

219
00:12:34,154 --> 00:12:37,338
Continue compressions. Push
one of epi and one of atropine.

220
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,591
I know it was stupid.

221
00:12:39,693 --> 00:12:42,693
The guard rails had just come
down. I thought we could make it.

222
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:46,013
It's my fault. Please.

223
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,000
Please. He's my little brother!

224
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:52,303
- He's... he's little...
- They're
working on him.

225
00:12:52,405 --> 00:12:55,806
OK? I just need you to take
it easy. All right? Take it easy.

226
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:57,325
He's gonna be all right, right?

227
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,391
Time of death, 20:48.

228
00:13:17,347 --> 00:13:20,064
Dr. Hunt, we need to intubate
him and get him to the OR now!

229
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:30,141
- Another Scotch?
- Yeah.

230
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:34,479
Mm...

231
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:38,582
- On the house.
- Uh, hey.

232
00:13:38,684 --> 00:13:43,221
If every drink is on the house,
then eventually there'll be no house.

233
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:47,591
- Right. Uh, six dollars.
- It's actually eight dollars.

234
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:53,447
- You having fun?
- I am.

235
00:13:54,617 --> 00:13:56,968
Good. That's good.

236
00:13:58,487 --> 00:13:59,767
Keep it.

237
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,939
Thank you.

238
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:08,646
Hey, here she
comes with our shots!

239
00:14:08,748 --> 00:14:10,348
Bring 'em over!

240
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:19,490
His pain is getting
worse, his color looks bad,

241
00:14:19,593 --> 00:14:23,428
his vitals haven't stabilized. I've
seen gas, Dr. Grey. This isn't gas.

242
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:25,730
We have to give the
medicine a little time to work...

243
00:14:25,832 --> 00:14:30,968
We gave it time to work. It didn't
work, which means this is not gas!

244
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:33,404
I've worked the night
shift. I know what goes on.

245
00:14:33,506 --> 00:14:36,824
I've lived through horror stories of
patients falling through the cracks

246
00:14:36,926 --> 00:14:38,487
because residents are
running around half-asleep

247
00:14:38,511 --> 00:14:40,271
and their attendings
are nowhere to be found.

248
00:14:40,363 --> 00:14:44,032
- I will not let
that happen to my son.
- I won't either. I promise.

249
00:14:44,134 --> 00:14:46,968
And I agree that it's not
gas. So let's run some tests,

250
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:50,688
- and find out
what's going on. OK?
- Thank you.

251
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:54,676
It's gonna be OK.

252
00:14:56,096 --> 00:15:00,164
To the groom!

253
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:02,495
It's rude to ditch out on
your own party, you know.

254
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:04,896
Yang is bartending. Do you
know how disturbing that is?

255
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:08,022
It's a phase. She's gonna be
fine. Besides, you won one of

256
00:15:08,124 --> 00:15:11,558
the most prestigious grants out
there. This night's about you, not Yang.

257
00:15:16,148 --> 00:15:18,466
Suit yourself.

258
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:23,070
How are we letting this
happen? I mean, seriously,

259
00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:26,808
- how are we just OK with it?
- Oh, I'm not OK, I'm jealous.

260
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:29,160
Cristina gets to live out
the twenties we never got to

261
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:32,296
'cause we were stuck in med
school. Watch, ten years from now,

262
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:35,616
we'll all have a midlife crisis
and end up doing the same thing.

263
00:15:35,718 --> 00:15:38,402
Except we'll be in our
forties and won't look as cute.

264
00:15:38,504 --> 00:15:39,404
How many of those have you had?

265
00:15:39,506 --> 00:15:41,789
Hey, my son is with his father.

266
00:15:41,891 --> 00:15:44,124
I am 24 hours child-free.

267
00:15:44,226 --> 00:15:47,261
If Cristina Yang can tend
bar 'cause she wants to,

268
00:15:47,364 --> 00:15:50,230
then I can drink
'cause I want to.

269
00:15:50,332 --> 00:15:53,000
- Double fisting!
- Has she mentioned me?

270
00:15:53,102 --> 00:15:55,386
- What?
- I know she writes to you.

271
00:15:55,488 --> 00:15:57,721
So I'm asking you if
she's mentioned me.

272
00:16:00,576 --> 00:16:03,694
Well, you know,
she's been very, um...

273
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:07,515
She's, uh... She just sort of
dove right into the medicine.

274
00:16:07,617 --> 00:16:12,720
And she's been... she's been busy.
And just, uh... Does that help at all?

275
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:16,407
I can't believe this. I honestly... I
can't believe that I am here again.

276
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:19,070
No, you're not doing this. You're
not going down this rabbit hole.

277
00:16:19,094 --> 00:16:23,614
I have to start all over! All over!
I don't even know how to do that!

278
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:25,616
I do.

279
00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:28,886
You might need a little
sexual palate cleanser.

280
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:31,838
A palate cleanser?
Are you serious?

281
00:16:31,941 --> 00:16:35,192
- What? It works.
- Sexual sorbet?

282
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:37,344
I love it!

283
00:16:41,684 --> 00:16:43,735
See that redhead back there?

284
00:16:44,653 --> 00:16:46,337
She's been eyeing you all night.

285
00:16:46,439 --> 00:16:49,507
Really?

286
00:16:50,477 --> 00:16:54,429
Oh. OK, yeah. OK.

287
00:16:54,531 --> 00:16:57,865
Thank you, Mark. All
right, I'm gonna, um...

288
00:16:57,967 --> 00:16:59,428
- I'm gonna go for it.
- Oh, no.

289
00:16:59,452 --> 00:17:00,695
Oh, oh.

290
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:02,102
Wish me luck.

291
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:06,750
All right, liver hemorrhage is
under control. Let's move on.

292
00:17:06,843 --> 00:17:09,644
Uh, there's another
one. No, two.

293
00:17:09,746 --> 00:17:12,596
- What is that?
- Part of the
steering column maybe?

294
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:15,783
Might have shattered
inside the abdomen.

295
00:17:15,885 --> 00:17:17,768
There's an infrarenal hematoma.

296
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,310
We should expose
the retroperitoneum.

297
00:17:19,406 --> 00:17:21,099
- Good idea.
- I'll get the aorta

298
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:22,567
- below the mesocolon.
- Slow down, Avery.

299
00:17:22,591 --> 00:17:24,719
We need proximal control first.

300
00:17:24,743 --> 00:17:26,522
You keep looking for
this kid's dashboard

301
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:28,440
- and I'll take care of that.
- Can I get more
light in here, please?

302
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:32,649
Dr. Hunt, his parents are here.
They're asking for an update.

303
00:17:35,789 --> 00:17:38,005
- Avery?
- I'm staying.

304
00:17:39,274 --> 00:17:42,577
I'd... I'd like to stay.

305
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:48,499
- Grey, tell them where we're at.
- - OK.

306
00:17:55,891 --> 00:17:57,402
What are you doing in
the attendings' lounge?

307
00:17:57,426 --> 00:17:58,993
- You could get in trouble.
- Pizza?

308
00:17:59,095 --> 00:18:02,080
I have stupid teenage patients

309
00:18:02,182 --> 00:18:04,743
who Super Glued themselves together
so their parents can't tear them apart.

310
00:18:04,767 --> 00:18:07,451
- Mm! That sounds romantic.
- Yeah, more like moronic.

311
00:18:07,553 --> 00:18:10,365
I have no idea how to get them
apart without taking off half their skin.

312
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:14,125
- Try acetone.
- Try going away!

313
00:18:14,227 --> 00:18:16,827
- Meredith, any ideas?
- Mm... Acetone?

314
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,262
Thank you.

315
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,379
So, what's the deal with Stark?

316
00:18:23,403 --> 00:18:24,723
A lazy, back-stabbing
weasel. Why?

317
00:18:24,754 --> 00:18:26,515
Because I called him in
to examine this patient...

318
00:18:26,539 --> 00:18:28,772
You called him in? Ha! I
wish I could've seen that.

319
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:32,125
- You don't call Stark.
- Well, my kid just
had pectus excavatum

320
00:18:32,228 --> 00:18:34,089
surgery and he
was in serious pain.

321
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,579
Yesterday, my
fundoplication patient

322
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:37,547
was vomiting.
You don't call Stark.

323
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:39,311
Well, this kid's
mother is a nurse

324
00:18:39,335 --> 00:18:41,255
- at Seattle Pres.
- Let's play a game.

325
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:44,739
There's one rule:
you don't call Stark.

326
00:18:44,841 --> 00:18:47,085
Alex, I'm serious. Normally,
I would handle this myself,

327
00:18:47,109 --> 00:18:50,555
but I haven't been on Peds in a while.
You know the complications with kids.

328
00:18:50,579 --> 00:18:52,562
- Did you order blood work
and a CT?
- Mm-hm.

329
00:18:52,665 --> 00:18:56,283
I'd add a LDH, a
CRP and a sed rate.

330
00:18:56,386 --> 00:18:59,754
With Stark you have to cover all your
bases, so if you do end up calling him,

331
00:18:59,856 --> 00:19:02,557
he has no excuse but to
get off his ass and come in.

332
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:11,114
Thank you.

333
00:19:11,217 --> 00:19:15,986
Well, turns out she was eyeing
my new haircut, and not me.

334
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:18,606
I gave her the hairdresser's
number though, so...

335
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:21,725
Well, you tried. You
put yourself out there.

336
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:24,061
- That's what counts.
- Uh... Yeah, no.

337
00:19:24,146 --> 00:19:28,549
Actually, that counts for nothing.
'Cause I put myself out there every day.

338
00:19:28,651 --> 00:19:33,037
You know, I write online profiles,
and I check the boxes that say

339
00:19:33,139 --> 00:19:37,875
- I like hiking and dogs...
- - Is there a box for fistulas?

340
00:19:37,977 --> 00:19:42,413
'Cause that's what I want.
A guy that can talk fistulas.

341
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:45,599
I want a guy that can direct me

342
00:19:45,701 --> 00:19:49,587
towards a better
scientific understanding

343
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:53,374
of just why a fistula may occur

344
00:19:53,476 --> 00:19:57,177
in patients that are
healthy one minute

345
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:59,296
and die the next.

346
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:06,804
Find a man that's interested
in fistulas and pancreases,

347
00:20:06,906 --> 00:20:12,609
and you'll find a man
that's not Internet dating.

348
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:28,775
What's wrong with you? You
didn't call Stark again, did you?

349
00:20:28,878 --> 00:20:32,012
No, I'm not calling him
until I get my CT results,

350
00:20:32,114 --> 00:20:35,749
and there's only one CT tech down
there and he's really backed up. So...

351
00:20:35,851 --> 00:20:41,305
Have I mentioned that I hate
the night shift, and I hate Stark.

352
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:43,357
Hey, chief. What are
you doing here? It's late.

353
00:20:43,459 --> 00:20:46,110
When a screaming mother calls
me at home to tell me my residents

354
00:20:46,212 --> 00:20:49,324
are about to kill her son, time
becomes irrelevant, wouldn't you say?

355
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:51,532
Dr. Grey, are you
familiar with Mrs. McNeil?

356
00:20:51,634 --> 00:20:53,474
She called you? I did
not give her your number.

357
00:20:53,569 --> 00:20:56,487
She's a nurse. She worked the
system. But what concerns me

358
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:59,990
is not how she got my number,
it's why she felt the need to call me

359
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:02,054
in the first place. Now,
what the hell is going on?

360
00:21:02,078 --> 00:21:04,706
I have a plan in place.
I'm just waiting for a CT,

361
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:06,341
and the guy's just very
backed up down there.

362
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:08,610
- How long
have you been waiting?
- Two hours.

363
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:13,119
- Get up.
- Excuse me?

364
00:21:13,222 --> 00:21:14,421
Get on your feet.

365
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:19,126
I understand you're a
little behind schedule.

366
00:21:19,228 --> 00:21:21,022
Yeah, it's just me tonight,
so we're backed up.

367
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:23,766
- Why didn't you
call the on-call tech?
- He wasn't feeling so hot.

368
00:21:23,799 --> 00:21:25,811
I thought I'd cut him a break.
He does the same for me.

369
00:21:25,835 --> 00:21:27,501
Listen... Hawk.

370
00:21:27,603 --> 00:21:30,971
We're in the business of saving
lives. Now, I don't care if your friend

371
00:21:31,073 --> 00:21:34,474
is lying in a ditch bleeding,
he will come in tonight.

372
00:21:34,576 --> 00:21:35,893
Now, get him on the phone now.

373
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,182
Hello?

374
00:21:42,302 --> 00:21:45,035
No, this is not your dude.
This is Chief Webber.

375
00:21:45,138 --> 00:21:47,983
What do I need? I need you
to get yourself into this hospital

376
00:21:48,007 --> 00:21:52,576
in the next five minutes or you and
your dude can kiss your jobs goodbye!

377
00:21:55,163 --> 00:21:57,414
Now, that's how you
get things done at night.

378
00:22:00,987 --> 00:22:04,438
I just left Lucas in
surgery. He's critical.

379
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:07,408
It's very touch-and-go at this
point, but we're still working,

380
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:09,944
and, um, we'll keep you
updated on his condition.

381
00:22:10,046 --> 00:22:11,845
- Thank you.
- OK. Thanks.

382
00:22:11,947 --> 00:22:14,732
- I'll let you know.
- And Reilly?

383
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:17,501
Our other son,
Reilly. How's Reilly?

384
00:22:24,143 --> 00:22:27,444
Has... anyone talked to you?

385
00:22:27,547 --> 00:22:29,613
No. We've been waiting.

386
00:22:31,934 --> 00:22:34,101
OK. Um...

387
00:22:35,171 --> 00:22:36,451
OK.

388
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:45,379
- Mr. and Mrs. Nash,
I'm, uh, afraid...
- No! No!

389
00:22:45,481 --> 00:22:47,325
- I'm sorry to say that...
- - Please don't say that.

390
00:22:47,349 --> 00:22:49,911
- despite our
efforts to save...
- Please don't say that!

391
00:22:49,935 --> 00:22:52,286
- Reilly's life...
- No, no!

392
00:22:52,405 --> 00:22:57,091
His injuries were too severe, and
he died in the emergency room.

393
00:22:57,193 --> 00:22:59,092
Oh, my God!

394
00:22:59,194 --> 00:23:02,946
- My baby! No, my baby!
- I'm so sorry.

395
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,086
No!

396
00:23:10,206 --> 00:23:13,573
Oh, my God! No!

397
00:23:13,675 --> 00:23:15,542
No!

398
00:23:21,767 --> 00:23:23,311
Please tell me he's gonna live.

399
00:23:23,335 --> 00:23:25,230
The parents didn't
know the brother died.

400
00:23:25,254 --> 00:23:27,704
Not to mention how he's
gonna feel when he finds out.

401
00:23:27,806 --> 00:23:31,742
- How do you live with yourself?
- Shut up! Just shut up, please.

402
00:23:31,844 --> 00:23:35,112
- Avery?
- Sorry. Sorry. I just...

403
00:23:35,214 --> 00:23:37,698
This is a really tricky part
right here. There's something...

404
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:41,368
- What is this?
- More suction
and some laps in here.

405
00:23:41,487 --> 00:23:44,655
- Here.
- Is that a piece
of the turn signal? Come on.

406
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:49,343
It's right next to the aorta. Can't tell
if it's just kissing it or if it's perfed.

407
00:23:49,445 --> 00:23:54,431
Get me some umbilical tape and
let's pull it so we can get some control.

408
00:23:57,686 --> 00:24:00,137
OK, pulling. Pulling.

409
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,925
- Wait, wait,
don't, don't, don't!
- Clamp.

410
00:24:05,027 --> 00:24:06,788
- Give me the clamp.
- Avery, I'll do this.

411
00:24:06,812 --> 00:24:09,246
Give me the clamp. Give
me the clamp. Here, take this.

412
00:24:09,348 --> 00:24:12,232
- Got it.
- I've got the
bleeder right here.

413
00:24:23,896 --> 00:24:25,796
Nice work.

414
00:24:25,898 --> 00:24:27,931
Nice work, Avery.

415
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:36,756
So this won't sting, but as
the skin starts to separate,

416
00:24:36,858 --> 00:24:40,561
- you may feel some pain.
- I feel nothing
but pain right now.

417
00:24:40,663 --> 00:24:43,196
Me, too.

418
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,432
It's your mother, Lauren.

419
00:24:45,534 --> 00:24:46,878
This is just gonna take a
few more minutes, right?

420
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:48,318
Hopefully.

421
00:24:50,923 --> 00:24:54,057
Is it working?
God, I can't look.

422
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,593
Please. If we could just
stay together one more day...

423
00:24:56,696 --> 00:24:58,863
Well, you'll definitely be
together for another hour

424
00:24:58,965 --> 00:25:01,165
because this is not working.

425
00:25:01,267 --> 00:25:02,950
Yes!

426
00:25:06,389 --> 00:25:10,641
Ah! Dr. Bailey! Yes!

427
00:25:10,743 --> 00:25:13,594
Dr. Bailey! I'm so
glad you're here!

428
00:25:13,696 --> 00:25:15,429
I'm not here, you don't see me.

429
00:25:15,531 --> 00:25:20,434
I just need a nap before I go
home. But first I need some food.

430
00:25:20,536 --> 00:25:23,016
This will just take a second.
I got these two 15 year olds.

431
00:25:23,071 --> 00:25:26,840
They Super Glued themselves together.
They're in love, or they think they are.

432
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:30,644
Anyway, I tried petroleum and
acetone to separate them, but...

433
00:25:30,746 --> 00:25:35,182
- Don't separate them.
- What?

434
00:25:35,284 --> 00:25:38,101
Young people need
love too, Kepner.

435
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:43,123
We all need love. If
the world had more love,

436
00:25:43,225 --> 00:25:46,726
we could get rid
of wars and fistulas.

437
00:25:46,828 --> 00:25:50,331
Why won't this damn
thing take my money?

438
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:53,450
Dr. Bailey, are you drunk?

439
00:25:55,037 --> 00:25:57,137
Tipsy. Mm... A little tipsy.

440
00:25:57,256 --> 00:26:01,258
Right. Um, I'm gonna go ahead
and take care of that for you.

441
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,260
- Oh...
- Mm-hm.

442
00:26:12,471 --> 00:26:15,422
Hey, Dr. Altman? Are
you available for a consult?

443
00:26:15,524 --> 00:26:17,691
I'm just waiting on
some CT results.

444
00:26:17,793 --> 00:26:19,326
Uh, well, Joe took my keys,

445
00:26:19,428 --> 00:26:22,691
so I'm pretty sure I shouldn't
be practicing medicine.

446
00:26:22,715 --> 00:26:25,075
- What are you doing here then?
- I'm killing time until Joe

447
00:26:25,101 --> 00:26:27,301
- gives me my keys back.
- Can't you do that at the bar?

448
00:26:27,369 --> 00:26:33,140
Cristina Yang is bartending, so
no. I can't. It's just too depressing.

449
00:26:33,242 --> 00:26:36,427
Cristina's bartending as,
what, some kind of joke?

450
00:26:36,529 --> 00:26:38,979
As some kind of bartender.

451
00:26:39,081 --> 00:26:41,109
Yeah, I know. That
look on your face?

452
00:26:41,133 --> 00:26:44,784
That's how my whole body
feels. And not just 'cause Cristina

453
00:26:44,887 --> 00:26:49,506
makes the world's strongest drink,
but because my aspirational couple

454
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:53,777
has broken up and they're
living on two separate continents

455
00:26:53,879 --> 00:26:57,239
and 'cause I'm dating men
who still live with their mother,

456
00:26:57,265 --> 00:27:00,400
but they don't admit
that on their profiles.

457
00:27:00,502 --> 00:27:03,103
They wait. They
wait... Thank you.

458
00:27:03,205 --> 00:27:07,041
They wait until I've spent
an hour applying my makeup

459
00:27:07,143 --> 00:27:13,080
and driving across town, and then
they tell me that small, little detail.

460
00:27:13,182 --> 00:27:15,031
Thank you.

461
00:27:16,201 --> 00:27:17,701
Oh. Oh.

462
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:19,836
And my star student,

463
00:27:19,938 --> 00:27:24,140
my most promising resident
that I have ever seen,

464
00:27:24,242 --> 00:27:28,895
is mixing Irish Car Bombs for a
bachelor party over at Joe's Bar.

465
00:27:28,997 --> 00:27:31,715
I'm not even gonna mention
that she's letting the bachelors

466
00:27:31,817 --> 00:27:37,137
feel her up at will, 'cause
that just adds insult to injury.

467
00:27:37,239 --> 00:27:40,774
- Crap, I'm... I'm really drunk.
- Pictures are up.

468
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:46,096
All I'm saying is that
that redhead missed out.

469
00:27:46,198 --> 00:27:48,532
If Joe's were a lesbian bar,

470
00:27:48,634 --> 00:27:49,811
you would've been
up to your ears in...

471
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:51,768
Please. Don't say vagina.

472
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:54,421
Huh. Now, I don't have to.

473
00:27:54,523 --> 00:27:57,440
God! I hate being drunk.

474
00:27:57,526 --> 00:27:59,926
You think it's gonna make
you feel awesome and happy,

475
00:28:00,012 --> 00:28:02,646
but it just makes you
feel tired and gross.

476
00:28:02,748 --> 00:28:04,842
Yang looked like she
was having fun tonight.

477
00:28:04,866 --> 00:28:08,602
What, the crazy party
girl thing? That's crap.

478
00:28:08,704 --> 00:28:11,154
Every girl who climbs
up on a table thinks she's

479
00:28:11,257 --> 00:28:16,193
the hottest girl in the room, but
really she's just dancing alone.

480
00:28:17,313 --> 00:28:18,595
You OK?

481
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:24,484
Yeah, I just... I need to sleep.

482
00:28:24,586 --> 00:28:28,104
- I need to sleep.
- All right.

483
00:28:30,392 --> 00:28:33,426
Mm...

484
00:28:41,603 --> 00:28:44,788
Drew's got a perforated ulcer.
And Cristina's working at Joe's.

485
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:46,940
- What?
- Forget it. It's bleeding.

486
00:28:47,042 --> 00:28:48,436
It must be from the
anti-inflammatories.

487
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:50,977
- Wait, what about Cristina?
- She's a bartender now.

488
00:28:51,079 --> 00:28:54,881
- I called Stark again,
and no answer.
- Well, big surprise.

489
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:57,700
- This kid needs surgery.
- I know.

490
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:06,543
Mrs. McNeil, this is Alex Karev.
He'll be consulting on your son's case.

491
00:29:06,645 --> 00:29:08,929
The CT scan revealed that
your son has a perforated ulcer.

492
00:29:09,031 --> 00:29:12,482
- That's what's
causing his pain.
- So does he need surgery?

493
00:29:12,568 --> 00:29:14,384
- Yes.
- And we've called Dr. Stark

494
00:29:14,487 --> 00:29:17,132
- and he's on his way.
- We can start
prepping him immediately.

495
00:29:17,156 --> 00:29:20,740
Thank you. Thank you.

496
00:29:24,796 --> 00:29:28,832
Hold on. Are we really gonna call in a
whole OR team without an attending?

497
00:29:28,917 --> 00:29:32,652
What if Stark doesn't answer the
page? What if he doesn't come in on time?

498
00:29:32,754 --> 00:29:35,355
What if the kid dies while
we're waiting to find out?

499
00:29:35,457 --> 00:29:37,868
Look, I'm taking this kid to the
OR whether Stark comes or not.

500
00:29:37,892 --> 00:29:39,871
Like the chief said, this is how
you get things done at night.

501
00:29:39,895 --> 00:29:43,307
What if we have to do a truncal
vagotomy or a pyloroplasty?

502
00:29:43,331 --> 00:29:45,493
- Have you ever
done those on your own?
- Not only can I do it,

503
00:29:45,517 --> 00:29:48,384
I can do it better than
Stark. Are you in or out?

504
00:29:49,755 --> 00:29:52,189
Like hell if I'm gonna
let you do it without me.

505
00:29:52,708 --> 00:29:54,207
I'm in.

506
00:30:00,565 --> 00:30:05,451
- OK. Is he under?
- Is he talking? Yeah, he's under.

507
00:30:05,553 --> 00:30:07,787
- No word from Stark yet?
- No.

508
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:10,190
Call him every five
minutes until he answers.

509
00:30:10,292 --> 00:30:12,692
- And page Dr. Bailey.
- Bailey's not on call tonight.

510
00:30:12,744 --> 00:30:14,010
Just keep calling her.

511
00:30:14,112 --> 00:30:16,007
I thought you said you
could do this better than Stark.

512
00:30:16,031 --> 00:30:19,098
Shut up. All right,
uh, ten blade.

513
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:40,220
Ooh! It's the OR.

514
00:30:44,593 --> 00:30:45,637
Uh...

515
00:30:45,661 --> 00:30:48,611
Hello? Uh, Dr. Bailey's phone.

516
00:30:48,713 --> 00:30:52,633
No, she is, um... She's
indisposed at the moment.

517
00:30:52,735 --> 00:30:55,268
Page someone else, thank you.

518
00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:58,171
OK, good. That's good.
Now, give me my phone.

519
00:30:58,274 --> 00:31:01,541
- I need to call Ben.
- Who's Ben?

520
00:31:01,644 --> 00:31:04,077
My ex. I dumped him.

521
00:31:04,179 --> 00:31:07,914
Which I now realize
was a big mistake,

522
00:31:08,016 --> 00:31:09,499
so I wanna call him.

523
00:31:09,601 --> 00:31:14,187
I wanna call him and
tell him I have needs.

524
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:19,326
'Cause he understood how
to take care of my needs

525
00:31:19,428 --> 00:31:22,179
in a way my husband did not.

526
00:31:22,281 --> 00:31:24,981
I want to tell him that. Ha!

527
00:31:25,084 --> 00:31:26,450
So give me my phone.

528
00:31:26,535 --> 00:31:28,612
- Are you sure about that?
- Give me...

529
00:31:28,636 --> 00:31:33,139
- Drunk-dialing
never really ends well.
- You are a virgin.

530
00:31:35,027 --> 00:31:38,195
Wow. Word really
does travel around here.

531
00:31:38,297 --> 00:31:40,680
I'm Bailey. I know everything.

532
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:44,050
Come... Come here, Kepner.

533
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:46,619
Come. Closer.

534
00:31:47,021 --> 00:31:48,855
Closer!

535
00:31:50,859 --> 00:31:55,278
Alex Karev is not the boy you want
to take your maiden voyage with.

536
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:59,782
Oh, God! Oh, God, yes. I know. I
am aware. You don't need to tell me...

537
00:31:59,884 --> 00:32:04,354
You take your maiden voyage
with a nice boy. A kind boy.

538
00:32:04,456 --> 00:32:08,191
A boy who loves you. A
boy that you love so much

539
00:32:08,293 --> 00:32:10,994
you want to Super
Glue yourself to him.

540
00:32:11,096 --> 00:32:15,332
You wait, you hear me?
Keep your knees together.

541
00:32:15,434 --> 00:32:17,717
'Cause believe me, even though

542
00:32:17,819 --> 00:32:21,787
you haven't met
your Ben... yet...

543
00:32:23,025 --> 00:32:25,642
you will meet your Ben.

544
00:32:25,744 --> 00:32:30,180
Not my Ben, but your own Ben.

545
00:32:31,533 --> 00:32:35,268
Who might or might
not be called Ben.

546
00:32:38,023 --> 00:32:40,890
Use soap and warm water.

547
00:32:45,047 --> 00:32:48,098
On... my maiden voyage?

548
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:51,985
On the Super Glue.
Use soap, water,

549
00:32:52,087 --> 00:32:54,404
and put a little acetone
in it. It works like a charm.

550
00:32:54,506 --> 00:32:57,857
- OK. Yes, ma'am. Thank you.
- Mm-hm.

551
00:32:57,959 --> 00:33:00,026
Mm!

552
00:33:01,530 --> 00:33:05,331
Salt, shot, lime! Here we go!

553
00:33:05,434 --> 00:33:07,500
- Yeah!
- You want some more water?

554
00:33:10,372 --> 00:33:12,616
You know, you could fire
her for drinking on the job.

555
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,292
Are you kidding? I did that
three hours ago. Take her home.

556
00:33:15,394 --> 00:33:17,377
Can't. Not until
she wants to go.

557
00:33:17,496 --> 00:33:19,391
- Why not?
- Because she's
got a lot of people

558
00:33:19,415 --> 00:33:21,935
telling her what to do, and she
doesn't need to hear it from me.

559
00:33:23,719 --> 00:33:26,252
So, what are you gonna do?

560
00:33:26,354 --> 00:33:27,782
I'm gonna sit here
and drink water.

561
00:33:27,806 --> 00:33:30,168
Make sure she doesn't
leave with anybody.

562
00:33:30,192 --> 00:33:32,642
Really? That... That's
your whole plan?

563
00:33:32,744 --> 00:33:34,424
Well, if she's gonna
act like a stripper...

564
00:33:36,315 --> 00:33:38,899
I'm gonna act like a bouncer.

565
00:33:39,001 --> 00:33:41,134
Oh, God.

566
00:33:43,872 --> 00:33:47,190
Dictate the op notes
and monitor his ABG's.

567
00:33:47,292 --> 00:33:50,026
I'm gonna rack out. I
have to be back here in...

568
00:33:50,128 --> 00:33:53,363
- two hours.
- I got it. Go.

569
00:33:54,316 --> 00:33:55,449
All right.

570
00:33:56,418 --> 00:33:59,118
Good work, Avery.

571
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:01,699
Go talk to the parents.
Give them the good news.

572
00:34:01,723 --> 00:34:03,163
- OK?
- OK.

573
00:34:08,763 --> 00:34:11,565
You can, um... You
can talk to me, you know.

574
00:34:11,667 --> 00:34:15,168
- If you want to talk.
- About what?

575
00:34:17,188 --> 00:34:18,972
I hear you every night.

576
00:34:20,592 --> 00:34:22,726
I'm just saying. I
had sleep problems.

577
00:34:22,828 --> 00:34:24,761
And they turned out
to be real problems.

578
00:34:24,863 --> 00:34:29,132
Yeah, well, I don't
have any problems.

579
00:34:29,234 --> 00:34:31,145
That kid was practically
dead when he got here,

580
00:34:31,169 --> 00:34:34,537
and I pulled half his car
out of him, so he lived.

581
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:38,708
He's gonna live to be stupid
another day because of me.

582
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:42,045
His parents aren't gonna
lose everything because of me.

583
00:34:42,147 --> 00:34:44,227
I call that a
pretty great night.

584
00:34:46,685 --> 00:34:49,152
So, what is your problem?

585
00:34:56,845 --> 00:34:59,045
- Any word from Stark?
- No.

586
00:35:01,366 --> 00:35:04,551
There's the perf.
Anterior duodenum.

587
00:35:04,653 --> 00:35:06,152
We could do a Graham patch.

588
00:35:06,254 --> 00:35:08,265
Excellent suggestion,
fellow surgeon.

589
00:35:08,289 --> 00:35:10,122
2-0 silk, please.

590
00:35:12,811 --> 00:35:16,091
Can you believe we called an
entire OR team and they came?

591
00:35:16,164 --> 00:35:18,364
- Amazing.
- We've got balls. Clamp.

592
00:35:18,466 --> 00:35:20,745
You've got balls.
I've got<i> cajones.</i>

593
00:35:20,769 --> 00:35:23,119
You know those are balls, right?

594
00:35:28,693 --> 00:35:31,728
Oh... I was just thirsty.

595
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:34,931
- I didn't wake you, did I?
- Oh, no. I was...

596
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,134
awake.

597
00:35:39,404 --> 00:35:40,904
Water?

598
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,441
I want...

599
00:35:45,544 --> 00:35:47,210
um...

600
00:35:49,347 --> 00:35:52,448
- sorbet.
- Sweet tooth?

601
00:35:52,551 --> 00:35:54,618
I think I have some cookies
around here somewhere.

602
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,319
Mark.

603
00:36:00,124 --> 00:36:01,858
Oh.

604
00:36:03,294 --> 00:36:05,462
Oh.

605
00:36:05,564 --> 00:36:06,763
Really?

606
00:36:08,834 --> 00:36:10,114
Really.

607
00:36:39,764 --> 00:36:43,800
OK. I told them about the
surgery and his recovery process.

608
00:36:43,902 --> 00:36:47,182
Do you think I should mention
his high chance for infection, or...?

609
00:36:47,206 --> 00:36:49,617
I don't know, I don't want to
worry them any more than I have to.

610
00:36:49,641 --> 00:36:53,760
No, just tell them he's
gonna feel pretty awful.

611
00:36:53,862 --> 00:36:58,448
That he lived, and
his brother died.

612
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:01,384
That every time he
feels glad to be alive,

613
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,553
he'll hate himself for it.

614
00:37:04,655 --> 00:37:07,056
Just tell them to
look out for that.

615
00:37:09,444 --> 00:37:14,247
He won't want to talk about
it, but he'll be glad they know.

616
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:20,210
All right.

617
00:37:21,373 --> 00:37:22,639
All right.

618
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,064
<i>Under the cover of darkness...</i>

619
00:37:32,567 --> 00:37:36,553
<i>people do things they'd never
do under the harsh glare of day.</i>

620
00:37:43,361 --> 00:37:46,529
Yeah, nice.

621
00:37:48,183 --> 00:37:50,294
- It's not as bad as it looks.
- It looks pretty bad.

622
00:37:50,318 --> 00:37:53,670
- Yeah.
- Hey. Thank you for calling.

623
00:37:53,772 --> 00:37:57,273
- I appreciate you staying,
Shepherd.
- Yeah.

624
00:37:58,476 --> 00:37:59,708
Cristina?

625
00:38:02,447 --> 00:38:03,880
Oh, my God, it's my boyfriend.

626
00:38:03,982 --> 00:38:07,150
- Husband. I'm your husband.
- Right.

627
00:38:07,252 --> 00:38:09,552
Sorry, dude. She's all yours.

628
00:38:10,755 --> 00:38:12,088
Come on.

629
00:38:13,024 --> 00:38:14,573
Come on. Yep.

630
00:38:16,394 --> 00:38:19,262
All right. Good night.

631
00:38:26,354 --> 00:38:28,871
Oh, good! You're awake!

632
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:33,043
- Indoor voice, please.
- Of course.

633
00:38:33,145 --> 00:38:36,913
You know, I really appreciate
you opening up to me.

634
00:38:37,015 --> 00:38:40,450
I mean, you always have that,
like, super serious Dr. Bailey face on,

635
00:38:40,552 --> 00:38:43,320
I couldn't even tell if you
liked me. But now, I mean,

636
00:38:43,422 --> 00:38:47,123
I don't know if I'd say
that we're friends exactly,

637
00:38:47,225 --> 00:38:49,892
but sort of, I mean,
don't you think?

638
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:52,428
- Dr. Kepner?
- Yeah.

639
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:56,066
This... never happened.

640
00:38:56,150 --> 00:39:00,953
- This never happened. Got it?
- Mm-hm.

641
00:39:01,055 --> 00:39:02,738
Say the words. This...

642
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,892
- Never happened.
- Never happened.

643
00:39:06,878 --> 00:39:10,830
Yeah. Yeah. OK.

644
00:39:16,254 --> 00:39:18,621
<i>Decisions feel wiser.</i>

645
00:39:28,767 --> 00:39:30,367
<i>People feel bolder.</i>

646
00:39:30,469 --> 00:39:33,186
What can Stark do?
We had to operate.

647
00:39:33,288 --> 00:39:35,421
He can yell. He will yell.

648
00:39:35,523 --> 00:39:38,858
Doesn't matter. The kid's in
good shape. The mom's happy.

649
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:42,862
- We did what we
were trained to do.
- Remember the first day?

650
00:39:42,964 --> 00:39:45,025
The chief said only
two of us would make it.

651
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:47,733
I thought it'd be
me and Cristina.

652
00:39:51,439 --> 00:39:53,473
How are we the
last two standing?

653
00:40:02,768 --> 00:40:05,635
I'm gonna make
your lives a living hell.

654
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:08,370
And you know what?
I'm gonna enjoy it.

655
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:10,706
You lied to my patients.

656
00:40:10,809 --> 00:40:12,608
You hijacked an OR.

657
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:17,563
You performed a surgery that you
had no possible business performing!

658
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:22,268
And for the life of me, I... I... I
don't know what you were thinking!

659
00:40:22,370 --> 00:40:25,654
Medicine has a
hierarchy for a reason!

660
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:27,523
If there had been
a complication,

661
00:40:27,626 --> 00:40:29,892
you know whose ass
would've been on the line here?

662
00:40:29,994 --> 00:40:32,094
Mine, not yours! Mine!

663
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:35,565
You doctors in this residency who
think you can do whatever you want

664
00:40:35,667 --> 00:40:37,667
whenever you want, I
got some news for you!

665
00:40:37,719 --> 00:40:39,759
I am the attending,
you are the residents...

666
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:47,393
<i>But when the sun rises...</i>

667
00:40:48,930 --> 00:40:51,231
<i>you have to take responsibility</i>

668
00:40:51,333 --> 00:40:53,566
<i>for what you did in the dark...</i>

669
00:40:53,668 --> 00:40:56,569
- I had to use soap and water.
- What?

670
00:40:56,671 --> 00:40:58,591
The acetone didn't
work on the Super Glue

671
00:40:58,639 --> 00:41:00,240
till I mixed it with
soap and water.

672
00:41:00,342 --> 00:41:03,526
I could use a little soap and
water right now. I feel disgusting.

673
00:41:03,628 --> 00:41:06,379
- I can smell you from up here.
- Dibs on the shower!

674
00:41:06,481 --> 00:41:08,643
- I want a beer. Who's up for a beer?
- Oh!

675
00:41:08,667 --> 00:41:11,801
- Where do we get a beer at 6am?
- At home.

676
00:41:16,490 --> 00:41:19,325
<i>And face yourself
under the cold, harsh...</i>

677
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:23,329
<i>light of day.</i>

678
00:41:35,026 --> 00:41:37,877
Water?

679
00:41:58,916 --> 00:42:00,583
Good morning.

680
00:42:01,219 --> 00:42:02,685
Good night.
