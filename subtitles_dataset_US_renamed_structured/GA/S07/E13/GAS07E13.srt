1
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:18,300
<i>Doctors practice
deception all the time.</i>

2
00:00:19,887 --> 00:00:23,505
<i>We give vague answers
to hard questions.</i>

3
00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:26,824
<i>We don't talk
about post-op pain.</i>

4
00:00:26,927 --> 00:00:29,261
<i>We say you'll experience
some discomfort.</i>

5
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:32,264
John Driscoll. White male, 62.

6
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:34,227
Alzheimer's diagnosed
eight months ago.

7
00:00:34,251 --> 00:00:35,784
Patient number one

8
00:00:35,903 --> 00:00:38,520
of Alzheimer's
NGF Clinical Trial.

9
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:41,657
<i>If you didn't die,</i>

10
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:44,593
<i>we tell you the
surgery went well.</i>

11
00:00:44,695 --> 00:00:48,630
<i>But the placebo has to be
the doctor's greatest deception.</i>

12
00:00:57,007 --> 00:00:59,341
OK, you're gonna hear a...

13
00:00:59,443 --> 00:01:01,326
little drilling sound.

14
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:08,517
How you doing, John?

15
00:01:08,619 --> 00:01:10,786
- OK.
- Great. You're doing great.

16
00:01:10,888 --> 00:01:12,271
All right. Envelope, please.

17
00:01:12,356 --> 00:01:14,589
<i>Half of our patients,
we tell the truth.</i>

18
00:01:14,691 --> 00:01:20,128
<i>The other half, we pray
the placebo effect's real.</i>

19
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,691
OK, John, we're gonna
insert the probe now.

20
00:01:32,793 --> 00:01:36,211
<i>And we tell ourselves that
they'll feel better anyhow,</i>

21
00:01:36,313 --> 00:01:40,448
<i>believing help's on
the way, when, in fact...</i>

22
00:01:40,551 --> 00:01:42,434
<i>we're leaving them to die.</i>

23
00:01:48,291 --> 00:01:51,393
You have to say something.
Words. Make words.

24
00:01:52,262 --> 00:01:53,795
- Holy crap.
- Yup.

25
00:01:53,897 --> 00:01:57,666
- A baby?
- Growing like a weed. In my uterus.

26
00:01:57,768 --> 00:02:00,568
Not like a weed.

27
00:02:01,906 --> 00:02:04,639
Like a mighty oak.

28
00:02:04,742 --> 00:02:06,325
We're gonna be great parents.

29
00:02:06,427 --> 00:02:09,878
- Mark, you don't have to do...
- Are you kidding?

30
00:02:11,165 --> 00:02:13,915
That's my kid in there.

31
00:02:14,017 --> 00:02:16,084
I'm a dad.

32
00:02:16,186 --> 00:02:17,585
We're parents.

33
00:02:17,687 --> 00:02:19,955
Of a baby.

34
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:22,190
- OK! You're in.
- Should we get married?

35
00:02:22,293 --> 00:02:23,508
Oh, no.

36
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,777
I mean, I'm all for raising
a baby with you, but...

37
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:27,379
there's a line.

38
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:28,981
You're right. That's good.

39
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:31,466
'Cause I'm in love with
Lexie and it would be...

40
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:36,772
Oh, my God... Lexie.
What am I gonna tell Lexie?

41
00:02:37,841 --> 00:02:40,074
OK, you think about that.

42
00:02:51,755 --> 00:02:54,222
Are you ready to talk now?

43
00:02:56,493 --> 00:02:58,960
I want to say some not nice
things, and I want you to listen

44
00:02:59,062 --> 00:03:01,780
without saying our relationship
is over or walking out.

45
00:03:02,565 --> 00:03:04,850
OK.

46
00:03:04,952 --> 00:03:07,252
I'm mad that you slept
with someone else.

47
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:09,232
And I know that we
were broken up, but still,

48
00:03:09,256 --> 00:03:11,572
you slept with someone else.

49
00:03:11,675 --> 00:03:13,519
And I'm even madder that
that person has a penis.

50
00:03:13,543 --> 00:03:15,794
And I know you're
bisexual. I know that, but...

51
00:03:15,896 --> 00:03:17,574
Would you rather I'd slept
with a busty redhead? 'Cause...

52
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:20,098
You have to give me a
chance to process this, OK?

53
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,417
- I'm processing!
- I didn't plan this.

54
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,853
OK?

55
00:03:26,189 --> 00:03:30,191
I... I didn't plan any of this.

56
00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:35,547
But there's a...
mighty oak or whatever

57
00:03:35,649 --> 00:03:38,617
showing up in our lives
in about seven months.

58
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:42,871
So now I have to plan.

59
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:45,974
And I don't know how long I
can wait for you to process.

60
00:03:46,076 --> 00:03:48,276
But I...

61
00:03:48,378 --> 00:03:53,831
I want you in my plan. I want
you to be a part of my plan.

62
00:03:56,202 --> 00:03:59,938
So... Are you in? Are you out?

63
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:03,909
Oh, God...

64
00:04:05,729 --> 00:04:09,114
I'm in.

65
00:04:09,216 --> 00:04:12,183
I'm in. But you have
to give me... You...

66
00:04:12,286 --> 00:04:16,471
I'm just... I'm still
so mad at you,

67
00:04:16,573 --> 00:04:19,474
so you have to give me a minute.

68
00:04:21,044 --> 00:04:23,044
OK.

69
00:04:29,536 --> 00:04:33,070
By injecting methylene blue, it's
easier to identify the structures.

70
00:04:33,173 --> 00:04:34,173
What do you see, doctor?

71
00:04:34,241 --> 00:04:37,009
Gall bladder, cystic duct,

72
00:04:37,111 --> 00:04:38,271
common bile duct.

73
00:04:38,295 --> 00:04:41,063
Yes. Misidentification
of the anatomy

74
00:04:41,165 --> 00:04:45,500
is the main cause
of biliary tree injuries.

75
00:04:45,602 --> 00:04:47,162
Today we're trying
this new technique...

76
00:04:48,154 --> 00:04:50,021
Put those things away, people!

77
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:52,607
No texting in my OR.

78
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:54,342
Save that for the drive home.

79
00:04:54,444 --> 00:04:57,645
Um... Actually,
we're not texting, sir.

80
00:04:57,748 --> 00:05:00,682
Dr. Bailey's performing a
Toupet procedure right now.

81
00:05:00,784 --> 00:05:04,936
There wasn't enough room in her
OR so we're just following it on Twitter.

82
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:06,404
Twitter?

83
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:09,707
What the hell is a Twitter?

84
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:13,462
I booked the OR, I read up on the procedure...
I know this thing better than my own name...

85
00:05:13,564 --> 00:05:16,008
I pre-rounded on the patient
and her pre-op labs are all done...

86
00:05:16,032 --> 00:05:18,066
Quadruple bypasses
are exciting, right?

87
00:05:18,168 --> 00:05:21,069
First assist gets to sew
all the grafts onto the heart?

88
00:05:21,171 --> 00:05:22,337
Plum job!

89
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:23,983
- I want it.
- It would be an honor.

90
00:05:24,007 --> 00:05:26,674
I know. You're thinking
whoever does this gets a leg up

91
00:05:26,776 --> 00:05:28,437
in the race for chief resident.

92
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:30,812
But you wanna know a
good way not to get it?

93
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:33,264
That's to bug the crap out of
me before my day even starts.

94
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:34,399
I'm sorry. I'll back off.

95
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:36,368
Actually, I'll go
to the skills lab

96
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:37,669
and practice my grafts.

97
00:05:37,771 --> 00:05:39,849
And you just let me know
if you need anything at all...

98
00:05:39,873 --> 00:05:42,023
Yang took the chart. She
took the chart? What...?

99
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:48,013
- What did Arizona say?
- Well, she said she's in.

100
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:50,465
- That's good, right?
- I'm still hedging my bets.

101
00:05:50,567 --> 00:05:53,629
I'm not gonna move back in with her until
I know for sure she's not gonna bail again.

102
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:55,447
- Hey, you got
dinner plans tonight?
- No.

103
00:05:55,471 --> 00:05:57,155
I'm cooking for you
tonight. Your place.

104
00:05:57,257 --> 00:05:59,457
I rocked a lap chole.

105
00:06:03,063 --> 00:06:04,373
So, when are you gonna tell her?

106
00:06:04,397 --> 00:06:05,797
Not until after my
home-cooked meal.

107
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:07,577
Mark, you do not
have to do this.

108
00:06:07,601 --> 00:06:10,847
I'm giving you a Get Out of
Jail Free card. No hard feelings.

109
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:13,182
You can be the cool uncle
that hangs out on Sundays.

110
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:14,606
I'm not the cool
uncle. I'm the dad.

111
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:17,308
You love Lexie, and
the last time a Sloan kid

112
00:06:17,411 --> 00:06:18,821
appeared in Seattle,
she dumped you.

113
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:20,189
Now if you were
the cool uncle...

114
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:22,748
I'm not the cool uncle!
Don't ever say that again!

115
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:26,351
- OK!
- This is my kid. I want this kid.

116
00:06:26,453 --> 00:06:28,353
- Cool uncle...
- Well, so tell her.

117
00:06:28,455 --> 00:06:31,656
Do not wait until this kid
comes out looking all Sloan-y.

118
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:45,837
- You didn't say
goodbye this morning.
- I had a surgery.

119
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:49,690
- I didn't want to wake you.
- No. You were starting
your clinical trial

120
00:06:49,792 --> 00:06:51,737
and you feel guilty
that I'm not on it,

121
00:06:51,761 --> 00:06:53,339
- so you snuck out.
- You're right.

122
00:06:53,363 --> 00:06:56,665
But I don't feel guilty
and I didn't sneak out.

123
00:06:56,766 --> 00:06:58,895
Patient number two, Daniel
Cobb, admitted and in a room.

124
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:00,363
His wife has some
questions for you.

125
00:07:00,387 --> 00:07:03,638
I... can't believe...

126
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:06,507
He picked you for this
thing instead of me?

127
00:07:06,609 --> 00:07:09,978
Well, Dr. Shepherd didn't
wanna leave anything to chance.

128
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,608
- Now you can both go to hell.
- It was open to all
the residents.

129
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:14,310
Karev just did a better
job of pitching me.

130
00:07:14,334 --> 00:07:18,703
It was open to all the
residents except for one!

131
00:07:22,576 --> 00:07:25,577
- You having a good day, Daniel?
- Yes, I am, Dr. Shepherd.

132
00:07:25,678 --> 00:07:27,957
Give me that new wonder
drug of yours, I'll be even better.

133
00:07:27,981 --> 00:07:30,609
If it came down to how much I
liked the patient, you'd be a shoo-in.

134
00:07:30,633 --> 00:07:33,285
Now, if Daniel gets the drug,

135
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:36,021
how soon will he stop
slipping in and out of things?

136
00:07:36,123 --> 00:07:38,857
Well, at this stage we don't know
any more than you do, Mrs. Cobb.

137
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,803
That's why we're gonna
do a two year follow-up.

138
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:44,195
And the idea that his condition
could be reversed altogether,

139
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:45,791
is that completely
out of the question?

140
00:07:45,815 --> 00:07:50,234
'Cause I just read that when the
drug was used on rats and monkeys

141
00:07:50,336 --> 00:07:52,837
there was some
reversal in tissue damage.

142
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:55,306
That's rats and monkeys. It
can be different for humans.

143
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:58,443
Well, I don't want to rule
out a reversal altogether,

144
00:07:58,545 --> 00:08:00,845
but right now we're trying
to stop the progression.

145
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:04,298
All right, Dr. Karev is gonna
take you down for an MRI later.

146
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,302
So if you have any more
questions today, page him.

147
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:11,439
I'm feeling better
already, Dr. Shepherd.

148
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:13,301
- Here we go!
- Here we go.

149
00:08:14,678 --> 00:08:16,656
A clinical trial's a little
different than a regular surgery.

150
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,920
You can paint a rosier picture.

151
00:08:18,014 --> 00:08:19,581
I didn't want to give
them false hope.

152
00:08:19,683 --> 00:08:22,683
You didn't give them any hope.
Look, if Mrs. Cobb thinks this is

153
00:08:22,786 --> 00:08:25,987
gonna give her husband a better
chance, she'll be a better caregiver.

154
00:08:26,105 --> 00:08:29,073
And in the end, he has a
better chance of success. OK?

155
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:30,941
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

156
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:35,697
- Is that all you're having?
- Yeah, I think so.

157
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:45,385
Chief, this is my
milk shake time.

158
00:08:45,409 --> 00:08:47,175
Milk shake time is not a thing.

159
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:50,045
You didn't bother to tell me that
you were broadcasting surgeries.

160
00:08:50,147 --> 00:08:52,374
Oh, I didn't think
it'd be a big deal.

161
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:54,415
Well, it is. What if
something goes wrong?

162
00:08:54,517 --> 00:08:57,747
Look, the patients who want to
do it sign a comprehensive release.

163
00:08:57,771 --> 00:08:59,549
And the nice thing is,
most of them want to do it.

164
00:08:59,573 --> 00:09:01,350
They're excited about
being on the cutting edge.

165
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:03,775
Until they code on the table
in front of the whole world.

166
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:05,710
In which case I'd stop tweeting.

167
00:09:05,812 --> 00:09:08,395
In the meantime, residents
from all over the country

168
00:09:08,498 --> 00:09:10,978
get to see a surgeon's
decision-making process.

169
00:09:11,034 --> 00:09:13,400
They get to ask questions
live. It's a great teaching tool.

170
00:09:13,503 --> 00:09:17,021
No, it's lawyer bait.
Shut it down, Dr. Bailey.

171
00:09:17,123 --> 00:09:19,674
Sir, if you understood
it, you'd be on board.

172
00:09:19,776 --> 00:09:21,943
- I understand it fine.
- Uh-huh.

173
00:09:22,045 --> 00:09:25,213
- I understand it, Dr. Bailey.
- If you say so.

174
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:26,864
I do say so.

175
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:31,219
Don't give me Bailey-eyes.

176
00:09:36,259 --> 00:09:40,661
I'll look into this Tweeter
thing. But no promises.

177
00:09:40,763 --> 00:09:42,647
Does this mean I get to
tweet in the meantime?

178
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:45,783
No, it means give me
a chance to look into it.

179
00:09:47,804 --> 00:09:49,682
Hi. What's going on?
How's your day going so far?

180
00:09:49,706 --> 00:09:53,186
Good. I've got a CABG later
this morning with Avery and Yang,

181
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:55,554
who have officially entered
into the rabid dog stage

182
00:09:55,578 --> 00:09:58,946
in the race for chief resident, which
could be a good thing or it could be...

183
00:09:59,049 --> 00:10:02,517
a bad thing, which... You really aren't
interested in my day at all, are you?

184
00:10:02,619 --> 00:10:04,169
I might be having
Mark Sloan's baby.

185
00:10:04,253 --> 00:10:06,613
Oh, good Lord,
he got to you, too?

186
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:08,640
Callie is pregnant
with Mark's kid.

187
00:10:08,742 --> 00:10:10,592
It's while we were... you know.

188
00:10:10,694 --> 00:10:15,330
I love Callie, and Mark, you know,
is human and clearly has good genes

189
00:10:15,432 --> 00:10:17,899
because he's both
pretty and smart.

190
00:10:18,001 --> 00:10:20,518
And I want to have
a kid, but with Callie.

191
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,698
I'm not sure that I want to
have Callie's kid with Mark.

192
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:25,751
Can you say something to me that'll
make me wanna have Callie's kid with Mark?

193
00:10:25,775 --> 00:10:28,760
Um...

194
00:10:28,862 --> 00:10:29,995
I gotta go.

195
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:35,850
What happened?

196
00:10:35,952 --> 00:10:38,253
- I might be miscarrying.
- You're not miscarrying.

197
00:10:38,355 --> 00:10:40,672
- Then it's an ectopic.
- Could it be a blighted ovum?

198
00:10:40,774 --> 00:10:42,157
It's not a molar
pregnancy, is it?

199
00:10:42,259 --> 00:10:43,836
Wow. We got a lot
of doctors in the room.

200
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:45,588
Who the hell are you and
what are your credentials?

201
00:10:45,612 --> 00:10:48,346
Lucy Fields, Harvard MD,
Duke OB-GYN resident,

202
00:10:48,448 --> 00:10:51,449
and now a Maternal-Fetal Medicine
fellow at Seattle Grace Mercy West.

203
00:10:51,551 --> 00:10:54,902
Damn good at my job.
Who the hell are you?

204
00:10:55,004 --> 00:10:56,571
We're related to the...

205
00:10:59,509 --> 00:11:01,776
- situation.
- Lesbian lover, baby daddy.

206
00:11:01,878 --> 00:11:04,145
Ah. And everybody's
a little wigged out.

207
00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:07,915
OK. So...

208
00:11:12,389 --> 00:11:14,305
There's your baby.

209
00:11:15,859 --> 00:11:18,459
There's the yolk sac...

210
00:11:18,561 --> 00:11:20,595
Looks good. You're good.

211
00:11:20,697 --> 00:11:23,247
- I'm bleeding...
- It's not uncommon.

212
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,060
Happens in around 30
percent of all pregnancies.

213
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:27,124
- It's probably fine.
- I don't see a heartbeat.

214
00:11:27,204 --> 00:11:30,788
- Where's the heartbeat?
- It's probably too early
for that.

215
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:33,358
I'll do blood work, but I'm
pretty sure everything's OK.

216
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:36,577
Just take it easy for the next
few days. Drink a lot of water.

217
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:39,497
- No tampons, no intercourse.
- Sing it.

218
00:11:39,599 --> 00:11:42,517
Call me if the bleeding
gets worse or if there's pain.

219
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:44,785
Otherwise, go live your life.

220
00:11:44,887 --> 00:11:47,471
All of you. While you still can.

221
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:55,162
Martha Elkin, 75, multivessel coronary
disease confirmed by angiography.

222
00:11:55,264 --> 00:11:57,632
Here this morning
for an off-pump CABG.

223
00:11:57,734 --> 00:12:00,367
That's just doctor speak
for a quadruple bypass.

224
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:03,871
- Thank you.
- Pre-op labs and
X-rays were normal.

225
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:06,290
OK, you're ready
to roll, Martha.

226
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:08,626
My husband went
down for some coffee.

227
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:11,796
He wanted to know how long
I'd be asleep after the procedure.

228
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:13,576
Well, Martha, it's hard to tell.

229
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,649
Every patient
reacts differently,

230
00:12:15,751 --> 00:12:16,791
but we'll keep him posted.

231
00:12:16,853 --> 00:12:19,333
Most patients wake
within 90 minutes.

232
00:12:19,422 --> 00:12:21,372
Oh, that's helpful, dear.

233
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:25,159
He'll be glad to know
that. We're both so nervous.

234
00:12:25,261 --> 00:12:28,712
Well, some anxiety is
completely normal, but...

235
00:12:28,815 --> 00:12:31,816
let me reassure you...

236
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:34,418
Dr. Altman is an
incredibly talented surgeon.

237
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,888
You're in the
very best of hands.

238
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:40,942
Martha, I'd like to give you
my cellular telephone number.

239
00:12:41,044 --> 00:12:43,394
Now, you or your husband,
if you have any questions,

240
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:45,913
if he gets a little worried
or wants an update,

241
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:47,175
then he can call this number.

242
00:12:47,217 --> 00:12:49,050
I'll even make sure to
have a nurse answer

243
00:12:49,152 --> 00:12:52,653
- if we're in the OR.
- Oh, you're wonderful.

244
00:12:52,756 --> 00:12:54,438
You all are!

245
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:58,242
This is the finest patient
care that I have ever seen.

246
00:12:58,344 --> 00:13:00,895
I feel like a VIP.

247
00:13:00,997 --> 00:13:03,247
Well, it's just what we do.

248
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,752
Hey. How long you
gonna be in there?

249
00:13:13,776 --> 00:13:17,662
I've gotta put on a localizing
frame. At least an hour.

250
00:13:17,747 --> 00:13:19,881
- An hour?
- Yeah, give or take.

251
00:13:19,983 --> 00:13:22,317
Dr. Shepherd wants me to
be as thorough as possible.

252
00:13:22,419 --> 00:13:25,420
No! I'm not doing
this without my wife!

253
00:13:25,522 --> 00:13:27,622
- Sir...
- No!

254
00:13:29,926 --> 00:13:32,154
- Mr. Cobb,
your wife is right here.
- That's not my wife!

255
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:35,496
- Mrs. Cobb... Look, it's your wife.
- That's not Victoria.

256
00:13:35,598 --> 00:13:38,783
Daniel... Daniel,
Daniel, Daniel... It's me.

257
00:13:38,885 --> 00:13:42,787
You're not Victoria.
You're not my wife.

258
00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:45,590
You're not Victoria. I want
Victoria! I want my wife!

259
00:13:45,675 --> 00:13:48,209
- It's Allison.
- Get away from me!

260
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:53,064
- Sir, who is your wife?
- I don't know.

261
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,765
- I don't know.
- Sir...

262
00:13:54,868 --> 00:13:59,070
I told you. It's
Victoria. I want Victoria.

263
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:00,437
Is she here?

264
00:14:02,642 --> 00:14:06,693
- No.
- Do you know where she is?

265
00:14:06,796 --> 00:14:11,082
- I... I don't know.
- OK. OK. I...

266
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:13,301
Well, I'm gonna go
find Victoria for you. OK?

267
00:14:13,403 --> 00:14:16,415
I'm gonna go look for her. I'm
gonna find her and bring her to you.

268
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:21,309
- You sit tight. I'll find Victoria.
- OK... OK.

269
00:14:23,012 --> 00:14:25,212
Do you know who Victoria is?

270
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:30,301
Victoria is the woman he loves.

271
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:41,879
They met at the home last year.

272
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:47,184
One day he asked me to wheel
her towards him and that was it.

273
00:14:47,287 --> 00:14:50,955
I watched him fall
in love with her.

274
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:54,808
- Well, Ben and I watched.
- You're Victoria's husband?

275
00:14:57,463 --> 00:14:59,263
Until she leaves me.

276
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:01,933
She's not gonna leave you, Ben.

277
00:15:02,035 --> 00:15:03,334
We'll see.

278
00:15:04,554 --> 00:15:07,788
Victoria was diagnosed
with vascular dementia.

279
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:11,008
It's not Alzheimer's,
but it might as well be.

280
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:13,428
She's like Daniel.

281
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:17,097
When she's lucid, she
knows I'm her husband.

282
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:21,702
When she's not, I go from
being her husband to...

283
00:15:21,804 --> 00:15:24,472
somebody that gets to hear
about Daniel all the time.

284
00:15:24,574 --> 00:15:27,225
Daniel can still be
in the trial, can't he?

285
00:15:27,327 --> 00:15:29,527
This doesn't mean
he can't do it?

286
00:15:29,629 --> 00:15:32,808
No, he can still do it. The rule for
the study is we need his consent.

287
00:15:32,832 --> 00:15:35,194
Once we have it, it's OK
if he's not always lucid.

288
00:15:35,218 --> 00:15:38,035
You don't have any
more openings, do you?

289
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,871
Unfortunately, the trial is
only for Alzheimer's dementia.

290
00:15:40,973 --> 00:15:42,289
There's no chance?

291
00:15:43,226 --> 00:15:45,092
I'm sorry.

292
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:57,488
This is seriously jacked-up.

293
00:15:58,591 --> 00:16:01,709
Mayo Clinic says "Good luck".

294
00:16:01,811 --> 00:16:04,145
Cleveland Clinic sent you a
whole bunch of smiley faces.

295
00:16:04,247 --> 00:16:07,965
And there's a resident from Sydney,
Australia joining us for the first time.

296
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:10,751
- Yay, Sydney.
- Turn it off, Grey. Chief's orders.

297
00:16:10,853 --> 00:16:13,454
But this is Mr. Windsor's
third operation.

298
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:15,434
Everyone wants to
know how it comes out.

299
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:17,986
Until I get the OK from the chief, we're
not even gonna tweet the time of day.

300
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:22,213
It's not like the chief even reads
tweets. It's not like he'll know.

301
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:24,432
Drop it, Kepner.

302
00:16:26,002 --> 00:16:28,902
I understand. He's the boss.

303
00:16:29,004 --> 00:16:31,806
And I'm sure that
he's got his reasons,

304
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:35,242
but you've also got
3,000 residents out there

305
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:38,562
who have been by
your side this whole time.

306
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:41,849
Through a couple of very
difficult, time-consuming,

307
00:16:41,951 --> 00:16:43,801
life-threatening operations.

308
00:16:43,903 --> 00:16:48,239
And now to tell them,
"forget it," just like that?

309
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:50,941
It's like...

310
00:16:51,044 --> 00:16:53,427
It's like turning off
the TV when Clarice

311
00:16:53,529 --> 00:16:55,379
is knocking on the
door of the house.

312
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:57,114
It's silencing the lambs!

313
00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:00,001
And the lambs wanna
scream, Dr. Bailey.

314
00:17:00,103 --> 00:17:02,169
The lambs wanna scream.

315
00:17:08,578 --> 00:17:13,731
- The man would never know.
- No. No, the man would not.

316
00:17:25,027 --> 00:17:27,745
Wanna know what's really
fun and not at all depressing?

317
00:17:27,847 --> 00:17:29,830
Alzheimer's research.

318
00:17:29,932 --> 00:17:31,682
Callie's having my baby.

319
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:35,252
- What?
- Right?

320
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:37,337
Best news of my life.

321
00:17:37,439 --> 00:17:40,291
At least it would be,
except for the fact

322
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:43,953
that Lexie wants a baby about
as much as she wants a root canal.

323
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:47,281
I guess I could tell her
I'm the baby's uncle.

324
00:17:47,383 --> 00:17:49,850
But I don't want to
be the cool uncle.

325
00:17:49,952 --> 00:17:51,997
The cool uncle's only
cool until the kid's like nine,

326
00:17:52,021 --> 00:17:53,765
and then the cool
uncle's just creepy.

327
00:17:56,108 --> 00:17:59,059
I'm the dad. I want this.

328
00:17:59,162 --> 00:18:00,927
And I want Lexie.

329
00:18:03,399 --> 00:18:05,244
What do I do? You're
the man with the answers.

330
00:18:05,268 --> 00:18:06,984
What do you think?

331
00:18:08,955 --> 00:18:11,399
How can Meredith and I try for
months and not have any luck,

332
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:13,385
and you look at somebody
and a baby appears?

333
00:18:13,409 --> 00:18:14,953
The Sloans are
unusually fertile.

334
00:18:14,977 --> 00:18:17,494
You're the classic
example of failing up.

335
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:19,525
Not exactly the advice
I was looking for.

336
00:18:19,549 --> 00:18:21,665
Well, you got it. Cheers.

337
00:18:28,241 --> 00:18:29,681
- Is she OK?
- Yep.

338
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:32,159
- Maybe.
- I said yep. Yep is not maybe.

339
00:18:32,262 --> 00:18:33,822
- It's yep.
- She paged us.

340
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:36,330
I paged you. Callie
hasn't left the exam room

341
00:18:36,432 --> 00:18:38,227
since you were last
here. Two hours ago.

342
00:18:38,251 --> 00:18:39,928
What if it is a molar pregnancy?

343
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,863
Or fetal demise.
Or an infection?

344
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:44,583
She doesn't seem to want to leave
the exam room until we rule out,

345
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:46,507
- what, everything?
- Well...

346
00:18:46,609 --> 00:18:47,970
- Callie.
- I'm bleeding!

347
00:18:47,994 --> 00:18:50,161
I don't wanna take any
chances with this baby!

348
00:18:50,263 --> 00:18:52,663
All right, what if
we run a culture.

349
00:18:52,765 --> 00:18:54,485
Just in case. Can't hurt, right?

350
00:18:56,952 --> 00:19:01,422
- Sure. Can't hurt.
- Good idea?

351
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:10,848
He followed me
through a snowstorm.

352
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:14,618
- Sorry?
- In college.

353
00:19:16,422 --> 00:19:18,422
Daniel saw me in
the student union

354
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:21,091
and he followed me to my class

355
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:24,094
in a snowstorm.

356
00:19:24,197 --> 00:19:26,763
Introduction to French Poetry.

357
00:19:28,034 --> 00:19:31,702
It was in this big lecture
hall and he sat there

358
00:19:31,804 --> 00:19:35,605
for an hour and a half,
twice a week for five months,

359
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:38,775
just trying to get up
the nerve to meet me.

360
00:19:41,848 --> 00:19:44,031
That was 40 years ago.

361
00:19:48,504 --> 00:19:49,686
Please...

362
00:19:51,824 --> 00:19:54,024
give my husband the drug.

363
00:19:56,846 --> 00:19:59,931
- Mrs. Cobb...
- You could do it
if you wanted to.

364
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:01,331
You know that you could.

365
00:20:01,433 --> 00:20:04,885
No, I couldn't. It's
completely random.

366
00:20:04,987 --> 00:20:06,620
The computer decides.

367
00:20:06,722 --> 00:20:09,034
We don't even know if he's getting
the drug until we're about to inject it.

368
00:20:09,058 --> 00:20:13,894
Then change it if you need
to. I need my husband back.

369
00:20:13,996 --> 00:20:17,048
I need Daniel back.

370
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:19,650
I'm sorry, I just...

371
00:20:19,752 --> 00:20:23,854
Even if the drug worked,
it's not gonna reverse things.

372
00:20:23,957 --> 00:20:25,990
But I can live with that.

373
00:20:26,092 --> 00:20:30,611
I can live with what
we have right now.

374
00:20:30,713 --> 00:20:32,930
I can live with being
a part-time wife.

375
00:20:33,032 --> 00:20:36,734
But I cannot live...

376
00:20:36,835 --> 00:20:40,487
with losing my
husband all the way.

377
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:43,374
So...

378
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:48,379
for God's sake...

379
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:53,084
give him the drug.

380
00:20:56,271 --> 00:20:57,988
Please.

381
00:21:03,963 --> 00:21:06,496
Day one and this
thing already blows.

382
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:09,483
We got one guy begging
us to get his wife on the trial.

383
00:21:09,585 --> 00:21:12,970
Then this other guy's wife wants
me to steal the drug for her husband.

384
00:21:13,072 --> 00:21:15,617
Well, you're the one who wanted
in on the trial of the century.

385
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:18,175
With peds, the problem's
right in front of you:

386
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,243
sick kid, worried parents.

387
00:21:20,346 --> 00:21:21,945
Here, you got a sick parent

388
00:21:22,047 --> 00:21:23,547
who doesn't even
know they're sick.

389
00:21:23,649 --> 00:21:27,685
Well, about five years ago,
I was visiting my mother.

390
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:30,621
And she starts telling me how
she thinks she's got herpes.

391
00:21:30,723 --> 00:21:34,358
And how she doesn't want to go
to the hospital and get checked out

392
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,405
because she's afraid
everybody will know.

393
00:21:36,429 --> 00:21:38,028
So, I realize that

394
00:21:38,113 --> 00:21:40,814
she thinks I'm her best
friend from med school,

395
00:21:40,917 --> 00:21:43,150
and it's 35 years ago.

396
00:21:43,252 --> 00:21:46,287
So... I had to just sit there

397
00:21:46,389 --> 00:21:48,700
and talk to my mother
about her possible herpes

398
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:52,359
for two hours. Two
very long hours.

399
00:21:52,461 --> 00:21:54,189
I couldn't cure her Alzheimer's,

400
00:21:54,213 --> 00:21:57,982
but at least I could give her
what she needed in that moment.

401
00:21:58,084 --> 00:22:01,902
- Advice about herpes?
- Advice about herpes.

402
00:22:08,644 --> 00:22:10,572
You may want to put
all that away, Mrs. Elkin.

403
00:22:10,596 --> 00:22:12,779
They're gonna come take
you to the OR any minute.

404
00:22:12,881 --> 00:22:16,984
- I don't think
it's such a good idea.
- What? The surgery?

405
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:19,320
Well, it's risky, isn't it?

406
00:22:19,422 --> 00:22:23,173
I mean, it's a five percent
chance of mortality?

407
00:22:23,275 --> 00:22:25,258
Yes, but...

408
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,680
that's a 95 percent
chance of success.

409
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:29,580
Those are good odds.

410
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:32,166
I've had such a wonderful life.

411
00:22:33,502 --> 00:22:36,837
My friend, Donna, she had a
big operation like this, and...

412
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,640
she was never the same.

413
00:22:39,742 --> 00:22:41,809
Nursing home. Couldn't
even feed herself.

414
00:22:41,911 --> 00:22:44,678
It was terrible. The poor kids,

415
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:47,781
it was so hard on them.

416
00:22:47,883 --> 00:22:52,736
Such a burden. I don't want
to do that to my children.

417
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:56,657
I know it's scary.

418
00:22:56,759 --> 00:22:59,927
And it can go wrong sometimes.

419
00:23:00,029 --> 00:23:03,046
But you could
have 20 more years.

420
00:23:03,148 --> 00:23:06,033
You could go to
this baby's wedding.

421
00:23:06,135 --> 00:23:09,536
Are you sure you
want to give that up?

422
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:13,573
If you walk out of here right
now, you could have a few months.

423
00:23:13,676 --> 00:23:16,010
Maybe a year.

424
00:23:16,112 --> 00:23:19,313
But you'll always be wondering
when you're gonna go.

425
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:22,015
And your family...

426
00:23:23,418 --> 00:23:26,753
they'll always be
watching you, terrified.

427
00:23:31,026 --> 00:23:33,526
Don't give up on yourself.

428
00:23:33,628 --> 00:23:35,378
Let us help you.

429
00:23:37,983 --> 00:23:41,752
- Will you be there?
- Every step of the way.

430
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:48,725
OK. I'll do it.

431
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:51,845
You'll be great.

432
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:58,869
Unbelievable. You think you're
gonna be able to do the grafts

433
00:23:58,971 --> 00:24:00,537
because the patient's
requesting you?

434
00:24:00,622 --> 00:24:02,334
Altman doesn't exactly
fall for that kind of crap.

435
00:24:02,358 --> 00:24:04,702
Believe it or not, not everything
I do is about competition.

436
00:24:04,726 --> 00:24:06,693
Yeah, as if.

437
00:24:19,108 --> 00:24:21,625
911 means you're dying!
Somebody has to be dying!

438
00:24:21,727 --> 00:24:22,770
Well, what if the
baby was dying?

439
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:24,294
There's nothing
wrong with the baby.

440
00:24:24,396 --> 00:24:28,499
Or you. You can't page me in a
panic every time you have a feeling!

441
00:24:28,584 --> 00:24:30,751
Don't yell at me!

442
00:24:30,853 --> 00:24:33,721
I am a hormone casserole.

443
00:24:33,823 --> 00:24:37,891
My body is not my own.
And something feels wrong.

444
00:24:39,579 --> 00:24:41,812
- Is it muscular?
- No, it's a feeling in my gut.

445
00:24:41,914 --> 00:24:44,464
- In your uterine gut?
- No, my metaphorical gut!

446
00:24:48,688 --> 00:24:50,253
Thanks.

447
00:24:54,126 --> 00:24:58,295
Arizona says she's still in, but
she said that before, and then...

448
00:24:58,397 --> 00:25:00,080
she left.

449
00:25:01,317 --> 00:25:03,683
I don't think she's
going anywhere.

450
00:25:03,785 --> 00:25:05,903
She loves you, Torres.

451
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:07,782
What about Lexie? What
are you gonna do about her?

452
00:25:07,806 --> 00:25:09,618
She's your soul
mate or something,

453
00:25:09,642 --> 00:25:11,903
and she's gonna
freak the hell out!

454
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:13,688
Everything in my life
is always a disaster!

455
00:25:13,712 --> 00:25:15,657
I really don't want
this to be a disaster!

456
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:18,081
I don't even want
to move or breathe.

457
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:19,399
I don't wanna do nothing!

458
00:25:19,502 --> 00:25:24,004
What if I do something
and it messes this baby up?

459
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:34,498
Martha Elkin's blood
pressure was slightly elevated,

460
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:37,640
but I let her rest and I retook it and
it's fine, so it should be no problem.

461
00:25:37,736 --> 00:25:39,381
And Tweedle Dum is here, too.

462
00:25:39,405 --> 00:25:40,837
Charts are updated.

463
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:42,517
Have you decided who's
gonna be first assist?

464
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:45,420
Why would I decide now?
Patient care has never been better.

465
00:25:45,444 --> 00:25:48,112
I mean, once I choose,
one of you is just

466
00:25:48,214 --> 00:25:50,391
gonna be skulking around
like a surly teenager.

467
00:25:50,415 --> 00:25:52,549
OK, this should
be an easy choice.

468
00:25:52,651 --> 00:25:55,386
I have been practicing these graft
attachments every day for a month.

469
00:25:55,488 --> 00:25:57,972
- Some of us
don't need to practice.
- Sure, Yang.

470
00:25:58,074 --> 00:26:00,674
You've got more experience
overall, but these last couple months

471
00:26:00,776 --> 00:26:03,510
you haven't exactly logged a
lot of hours in the OR, have you?

472
00:26:12,371 --> 00:26:14,688
That's not...

473
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:17,857
You really had to go
there? You're that insecure?

474
00:26:17,959 --> 00:26:19,259
No.

475
00:26:20,362 --> 00:26:22,012
Just that much of an idiot.

476
00:26:22,114 --> 00:26:24,047
Damn it.

477
00:26:24,149 --> 00:26:25,993
Can I help you with
something there, Chief?

478
00:26:26,017 --> 00:26:28,619
I'm trying to look at
Bailey's teats on the Internet.

479
00:26:28,721 --> 00:26:32,422
- I think you mean
"tweets," sir.
- Whatever.

480
00:26:32,524 --> 00:26:33,923
No, not whatever.

481
00:26:34,025 --> 00:26:38,027
It's important you get
that one right. Let me try.

482
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:39,996
Bailey's putting her
surgeries on the Internet

483
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:42,399
for the whole world to
see. I told her I'd look into it,

484
00:26:42,501 --> 00:26:43,800
but I think it's
a terrible idea.

485
00:26:43,902 --> 00:26:45,897
I dunno. Might be a good
way to reach students.

486
00:26:45,921 --> 00:26:49,206
Or it might be Bailey bragging
to the world about Bailey.

487
00:26:49,308 --> 00:26:51,374
This thing isn't
designed for medicine.

488
00:26:51,477 --> 00:26:53,110
It's designed for gossip.

489
00:26:53,212 --> 00:26:56,479
For now. But look at GPS. It
was designed for the US military

490
00:26:56,581 --> 00:26:58,621
to keep an eye on
foreign troop movements.

491
00:26:58,684 --> 00:27:00,394
Now it's in everyone's car.

492
00:27:00,418 --> 00:27:02,965
You know, you go out. You
never have to get lost again.

493
00:27:02,989 --> 00:27:05,089
Yeah, I don't go out.

494
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:06,969
Let's save that
conversation for next time.

495
00:27:06,993 --> 00:27:08,604
There you go.
Bailey's Twitter page.

496
00:27:08,628 --> 00:27:11,027
Looks like she's tweeting
a surgery right now.

497
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:12,378
What?!

498
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,867
So that's why we also had
to do a left hemicolectomy.

499
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:19,736
Um...

500
00:27:19,839 --> 00:27:21,471
Here's a question from...

501
00:27:21,573 --> 00:27:24,858
Dr. Bailey, I specifically told
you not to tweet your surgeries

502
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:29,546
- until I looked into it.
- I'm sorry, Chief,
I misunderstood.

503
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:32,766
I thought you said I could
tweet until you decided.

504
00:27:32,868 --> 00:27:35,602
Don't play dumb. That's not
what I said and you know it.

505
00:27:35,704 --> 00:27:36,753
Put away that little toy.

506
00:27:37,923 --> 00:27:39,472
He's hemorrhaging.

507
00:27:39,574 --> 00:27:42,342
The blood's coming from... I
don't know where it's coming from.

508
00:27:42,444 --> 00:27:45,011
OK, hold on. Let's see...

509
00:27:47,449 --> 00:27:51,835
Yeah, we've got a
pseudoaneurysm in the splenic artery.

510
00:27:51,937 --> 00:27:54,265
How did that... What happened?

511
00:27:54,289 --> 00:27:57,057
Pancreatic enzymes are
leaking into the abdomen.

512
00:27:57,159 --> 00:27:59,843
They're dissolving the
blood vessels. Clamp.

513
00:27:59,945 --> 00:28:01,089
You need to get the
spleen out of there.

514
00:28:01,113 --> 00:28:02,646
I'm already on it. Clamp.

515
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:07,317
Anyone see any more bleeding?

516
00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:09,987
No, but what's left of the
pancreas is still leaking.

517
00:28:10,088 --> 00:28:12,106
We need to take
out that whole thing.

518
00:28:12,208 --> 00:28:14,474
It's one thing to live
with half a pancreas,

519
00:28:14,576 --> 00:28:17,878
but to remove the whole
thing... His life's gonna be hell.

520
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:21,815
Grey, put that damn thing away!

521
00:28:21,917 --> 00:28:23,027
This is exactly what
I was talking about.

522
00:28:23,051 --> 00:28:24,396
- Grey...
- It's Walter Reed.

523
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:27,020
They suggest an islet
cell autotransplant?

524
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:29,790
That's for pancreatitis. You
don't do it with trauma patients.

525
00:28:29,892 --> 00:28:31,172
What is it exactly?

526
00:28:31,243 --> 00:28:33,243
You isolate the cells
from the pancreas

527
00:28:33,329 --> 00:28:35,929
and inject them into the
liver. They trick the liver

528
00:28:36,031 --> 00:28:38,915
into acting like a pancreas
and making insulin.

529
00:28:39,017 --> 00:28:41,751
Yeah, when it works. You
need an awful lot of cells.

530
00:28:41,853 --> 00:28:44,204
You know, just because
it isn't done for a trauma

531
00:28:44,306 --> 00:28:46,806
- it doesn't mean...
- I know. But even if we wanted to,

532
00:28:46,908 --> 00:28:48,708
we don't have the
equipment to extract cells.

533
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:51,178
You need a Ricordi chamber.

534
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:53,747
We don't have it, but
Northwestern does.

535
00:28:54,767 --> 00:28:57,133
How do you know?

536
00:28:57,235 --> 00:29:00,148
They can get it on a plane and
have the equipment here in six hours.

537
00:29:00,172 --> 00:29:04,074
- It's too late. He's too unstable.
- OK. Hold on.

538
00:29:04,176 --> 00:29:07,761
Denver... Tacoma
Methodist. Yes! They've got it.

539
00:29:07,863 --> 00:29:09,146
Tacoma...

540
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:10,547
We take out the pancreas.

541
00:29:10,649 --> 00:29:12,443
I get on the helicopter
to Tacoma with it.

542
00:29:12,467 --> 00:29:15,218
I'm back in 90 minutes.
You manage in the meantime.

543
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:21,591
- Let's do it.
- OK. Tell them.

544
00:29:21,693 --> 00:29:24,711
She's wigged out, OK. Now she
won't say anything. I think it's my fault.

545
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:27,492
- What did you do?
- We were busting
each other's balls,

546
00:29:27,516 --> 00:29:29,194
we both wanted the same surgery,
and I may have said something

547
00:29:29,218 --> 00:29:31,735
about her... flaming out.

548
00:29:36,658 --> 00:29:39,459
Hey. Hey.

549
00:29:39,562 --> 00:29:42,412
- I want Owen.
- Go find him!

550
00:29:48,654 --> 00:29:50,153
What the hell...?

551
00:29:53,308 --> 00:29:55,442
He's gonna be running
around for the next hour

552
00:29:55,544 --> 00:29:58,695
while I sew grafts on
a quadruple bypass.

553
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:02,231
Owen's at the dentist.
He'll be hard to find.

554
00:30:03,836 --> 00:30:07,421
- You are evil.
- He started it.

555
00:30:13,312 --> 00:30:15,945
Now this is the
hard-core machine.

556
00:30:16,047 --> 00:30:19,266
- Highest resolution there is.
- Thank you.

557
00:30:19,368 --> 00:30:22,502
Now, it's almost impossible to find
a heartbeat until the eighth week,

558
00:30:22,604 --> 00:30:24,020
even with this thing.

559
00:30:24,122 --> 00:30:28,024
In fact, I don't even have moms
come in until the eighth week

560
00:30:28,126 --> 00:30:30,355
because they come in,
they don't see a heartbeat

561
00:30:30,379 --> 00:30:34,314
and they freak out and they
camp out on my exam table all day.

562
00:30:34,416 --> 00:30:37,817
But since you've already
camped out here all day,

563
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,597
it can't hurt to have
another look, right?

564
00:30:42,891 --> 00:30:47,477
- How's he holding up, Dr. Knox?
- PH is good. He's normothermic. Stable.

565
00:30:52,634 --> 00:30:54,584
Um, uh...

566
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:58,689
A resident at Hopkins wants to
know why they don't normally do

567
00:30:58,791 --> 00:31:02,792
islet cell autotransplantation
in a trauma patient?

568
00:31:03,595 --> 00:31:06,446
But we're not tweeting, so...

569
00:31:08,967 --> 00:31:11,067
Um...

570
00:31:11,169 --> 00:31:14,537
In a trauma, the pancreas
is usually too damaged.

571
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:18,158
- You can't get enough cells.
- OK.

572
00:31:23,349 --> 00:31:24,349
Um...

573
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:29,169
I got another
question. From Emory.

574
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:32,367
Go ahead.

575
00:31:32,391 --> 00:31:33,874
Will you use the portal vein

576
00:31:33,976 --> 00:31:37,944
to inject the islet
cells into the liver?

577
00:31:38,046 --> 00:31:39,457
Yes, but it's a little tricky.

578
00:31:39,481 --> 00:31:42,001
The portal vein is
partially dissolved

579
00:31:42,050 --> 00:31:43,483
because of the enzymes.

580
00:31:43,585 --> 00:31:45,902
Cool! Good answer.

581
00:31:47,823 --> 00:31:50,540
Oh, this is a message for you.

582
00:31:50,642 --> 00:31:52,659
It says, "Hi, Chief Webber.

583
00:31:52,761 --> 00:31:55,879
Dr. Neil Lefkoff.
University of Miami.

584
00:31:55,981 --> 00:31:59,082
I was a resident at Seattle
Grace eight years ago.

585
00:31:59,184 --> 00:32:01,451
It's a pleasure to be
scrubbing in with you again, sir".

586
00:32:01,553 --> 00:32:05,789
Neil? Really?

587
00:32:10,829 --> 00:32:12,428
Well, I'll be...

588
00:32:47,949 --> 00:32:51,617
OK, we've placed the Octopus
Tissue Stabilizer. Now what?

589
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:54,204
Dissect out the
LAD, nick the artery,

590
00:32:54,306 --> 00:32:57,407
put in a shunt and put the
graft in distal to the blockage.

591
00:32:57,509 --> 00:32:58,991
OK, good. Go for it.

592
00:32:59,094 --> 00:33:02,962
Dr. Avery. Nice of
you to finally join us.

593
00:33:04,866 --> 00:33:07,701
And, before we had these machines,
we used to mince up the pancreas

594
00:33:07,802 --> 00:33:12,022
and spin it ourselves. Dr. Ellis Grey
taught me how to do that 20 years ago.

595
00:33:12,124 --> 00:33:14,085
- She would take the...
- OK, slow down, Chief.

596
00:33:14,109 --> 00:33:16,360
I can only do 140
characters at a time.

597
00:33:16,462 --> 00:33:18,862
She had this trick where
after the final washing, she...

598
00:33:18,964 --> 00:33:22,715
Oh, man, what was
it? It was classic Ellis.

599
00:33:22,818 --> 00:33:26,753
What... What was it?
Forget it, put a pin in it.

600
00:33:26,855 --> 00:33:30,790
Anyway, she would take... We'd
put the minced up pancreas...

601
00:33:41,953 --> 00:33:46,606
- Nice. What do we do next?
- Check the flow in the graft.

602
00:33:49,477 --> 00:33:52,562
All right, Mr. Cobb.
Everything is looking good.

603
00:33:59,738 --> 00:34:03,657
- How's he doing?
- Stable. Not acidotic
or hypothermic.

604
00:34:03,759 --> 00:34:06,209
- How many cells did you get?
- Three hundred thousand.

605
00:34:06,311 --> 00:34:10,030
- Is that enough?
- Normally you want
about a million,

606
00:34:10,132 --> 00:34:11,747
but it's better than nothing.

607
00:34:14,268 --> 00:34:17,337
- Nothing?
- Just give me a minute.

608
00:34:17,439 --> 00:34:19,079
- This was a bad idea.
- Callie.

609
00:34:19,107 --> 00:34:21,269
That was stupid. She said it's
too early, she can't find it yet.

610
00:34:21,293 --> 00:34:23,771
Doesn't mean a dead baby, it
just means it was really stupid.

611
00:34:23,795 --> 00:34:26,162
Shut up.

612
00:34:33,138 --> 00:34:34,404
There.

613
00:34:38,359 --> 00:34:39,909
Oh, my God.

614
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:47,451
Oh, my God.

615
00:34:52,857 --> 00:34:56,209
- OK, we're almost there.
- Can I have the envelope?

616
00:35:13,395 --> 00:35:15,745
OK, Daniel, I'm gonna
insert the probe now.

617
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,886
Very good, Mr. Cobb.

618
00:35:36,935 --> 00:35:38,175
Honey?

619
00:35:39,371 --> 00:35:42,155
Hey, how you feeling?

620
00:35:42,257 --> 00:35:46,309
I'm OK. I've got
a slight headache.

621
00:35:52,851 --> 00:35:55,401
Where's my Victoria?

622
00:35:57,823 --> 00:35:59,021
Can I see her?

623
00:36:05,964 --> 00:36:07,297
Oh.

624
00:36:07,399 --> 00:36:10,233
Mrs. Cobb, he just
came out of surgery.

625
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:12,969
Look, this doesn't
mean it's not gonna work.

626
00:36:13,071 --> 00:36:15,054
We won't know that for a while.

627
00:36:15,156 --> 00:36:18,041
When he acts like this,
you just need to tell yourself

628
00:36:18,143 --> 00:36:20,276
this is not your husband.

629
00:36:20,378 --> 00:36:22,411
But he is somebody
who needs your help.

630
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:25,031
So whatever you can give him.

631
00:36:43,551 --> 00:36:45,084
Daniel...

632
00:36:46,321 --> 00:36:48,854
I'm gonna call Victoria...

633
00:36:48,956 --> 00:36:53,393
and get her here as
soon as I can. OK?

634
00:36:56,431 --> 00:36:57,864
Thank you.

635
00:37:03,522 --> 00:37:04,854
Karev.

636
00:37:07,326 --> 00:37:09,203
I couldn't have done
it any better myself.

637
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:12,929
You reassured her. You got her
to focus on what was important.

638
00:37:13,865 --> 00:37:16,182
- I'm off the trial.
- What?

639
00:37:16,284 --> 00:37:19,230
It's too depressing. I can't
handle this for the next two years.

640
00:37:19,254 --> 00:37:22,021
- You just handled it.
- No. That was Meredith talking.

641
00:37:22,123 --> 00:37:25,224
She told me what to say. She's
been saving my ass all day.

642
00:37:25,327 --> 00:37:28,106
You need to get over this thing where
you're just thinking of her as your wife.

643
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:31,765
Because your wife is the only person
twisted enough to handle this crap.

644
00:37:33,101 --> 00:37:36,169
Oh, that said, I'm in the
race for chief resident.

645
00:37:36,271 --> 00:37:37,753
And so far, I'm kicking ass.

646
00:37:37,855 --> 00:37:40,856
So I'd appreciate it if you mentioned
to Dr. Webber that I prioritized

647
00:37:40,959 --> 00:37:43,492
the patient's needs
over my personal gain.

648
00:37:56,508 --> 00:37:58,040
Take care of her.

649
00:37:58,142 --> 00:38:01,594
Any time, Martha, any time.

650
00:38:03,982 --> 00:38:05,882
Bite me, Yang.

651
00:38:09,904 --> 00:38:13,773
Chief, I just wanted to update
you on Anthony Windsor.

652
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:16,025
- Anthony...?
- Windsor.

653
00:38:16,111 --> 00:38:19,578
- Our pancreas patient.
- Oh, yeah, right, right.

654
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:23,282
- What's all this?
- This is Ellis Grey's
old journals.

655
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:25,818
I'm trying to find the
answer to a thing...

656
00:38:25,921 --> 00:38:29,989
Well, anyway, the islet cells
have started producing insulin.

657
00:38:30,091 --> 00:38:32,003
It looks like the
transplant's gonna take.

658
00:38:32,027 --> 00:38:36,328
That's great, great.
Excellent work, Dr. Bailey.

659
00:38:37,766 --> 00:38:43,302
OK, sir, I'm doing a robotic
subtotal gastrectomy tomorrow.

660
00:38:43,404 --> 00:38:44,704
Now, I know you wanted time...

661
00:38:44,806 --> 00:38:48,591
That's fine.
Absolutely. Tweet away.

662
00:38:48,693 --> 00:38:51,694
Yeah! Yes, yes...
There it is! OK...

663
00:38:51,796 --> 00:38:54,580
She would add
heparin and aprotinin.

664
00:38:54,682 --> 00:38:56,015
Now when you're
tweeting tomorrow,

665
00:38:56,117 --> 00:38:59,018
tell everyone that Ellis Grey's
trick was to add those, OK?

666
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:02,772
- Make sure you tell them that.
- Yes, sir.

667
00:39:16,471 --> 00:39:19,105
What are you doing?
Is that one of my boxes?

668
00:39:19,207 --> 00:39:21,223
Don't get up. You rest.

669
00:39:21,325 --> 00:39:23,404
You shouldn't be lifting
any heavy things. I got this.

670
00:39:23,428 --> 00:39:25,868
No, I'll get up if I want to. Are
you moving my stuff back in?

671
00:39:25,913 --> 00:39:29,699
- Callie.
- I haven't said
I'm moving back in yet.

672
00:39:29,801 --> 00:39:30,984
I... We're not together.

673
00:39:31,086 --> 00:39:33,686
You can take those
back to Mark's place.

674
00:39:33,789 --> 00:39:35,571
Shut up. Just shut up.

675
00:39:35,673 --> 00:39:37,768
You don't get to tell me
that we're not together.

676
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:40,537
We are together. Because
I love you and you love me,

677
00:39:40,561 --> 00:39:42,139
and none of the
rest of it matters.

678
00:39:42,163 --> 00:39:44,230
We are together.

679
00:39:44,332 --> 00:39:45,760
And if you ever sleep
with anyone else again,

680
00:39:45,784 --> 00:39:47,678
man or woman, I will
kick the crap out of you.

681
00:39:47,702 --> 00:39:48,929
Now you sit your
ass back down there

682
00:39:48,953 --> 00:39:50,531
because that's my baby in there,

683
00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:53,039
and I don't want anything
happening to my baby!

684
00:39:54,909 --> 00:39:56,191
Your baby, huh?

685
00:40:00,131 --> 00:40:01,631
Our baby.

686
00:40:01,733 --> 00:40:03,566
There was a heartbeat.

687
00:40:03,668 --> 00:40:07,270
- Mm-hmm.
- And it was...

688
00:40:11,609 --> 00:40:13,743
We're having a baby.

689
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:21,784
Do I still have to sit down?
Because I'd rather rip your clothes off.

690
00:40:23,154 --> 00:40:25,905
I'll do the ripping. You rest.

691
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:31,861
<i>Doctors practice
deception every day.</i>

692
00:40:31,963 --> 00:40:35,732
<i>On our patients.
On their families...</i>

693
00:40:35,833 --> 00:40:38,401
I'm putting in tarragon.

694
00:40:38,503 --> 00:40:40,781
Not that I have any idea
what tarragon tastes like,

695
00:40:40,805 --> 00:40:42,866
but I think when
people use tarragon,

696
00:40:42,890 --> 00:40:45,002
it makes them seem like
they know what they're doing.

697
00:40:45,026 --> 00:40:46,792
Basil can't do that.

698
00:40:46,894 --> 00:40:49,378
Anybody can sling some
basil around the kitchen.

699
00:40:50,331 --> 00:40:54,083
- Callie's pregnant.
- Oh, my God!

700
00:40:54,185 --> 00:40:57,437
That's great. She loves babies.

701
00:40:57,539 --> 00:41:02,374
Did they do a turkey baster
thing or something? I mean...

702
00:41:02,476 --> 00:41:03,721
Wait a minute. OK, so wait...

703
00:41:03,745 --> 00:41:07,312
Arizona just got
back, and they...

704
00:41:07,415 --> 00:41:09,782
were they doing...? Wait,
was this before they...?

705
00:41:18,293 --> 00:41:20,793
I saw the heartbeat today.

706
00:41:22,830 --> 00:41:25,281
This is my kid.
This is a part of me.

707
00:41:31,306 --> 00:41:32,871
Please, is there any
way that we can...

708
00:41:32,974 --> 00:41:35,858
How the hell...

709
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:40,713
did you get me in
this position twice?!

710
00:41:40,815 --> 00:41:42,415
It's...

711
00:41:43,318 --> 00:41:44,783
unbelievable.

712
00:41:46,421 --> 00:41:49,155
You are unbelievable!

713
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:55,962
<i>But the worst deception
we practice is on ourselves.</i>

714
00:42:02,203 --> 00:42:06,338
My next Alzheimer's
surgery is tomorrow at seven.

715
00:42:08,176 --> 00:42:10,459
Put your name on the board.

716
00:42:10,562 --> 00:42:13,546
<i>Which is why sometimes it
takes us a while to realize...</i>

717
00:42:15,149 --> 00:42:18,401
<i>that the truth has been in
front of us the whole time.</i>
