1
00:00:04,105 --> 00:00:06,049
<i>Every cell in the human body</i>

2
00:00:06,073 --> 00:00:07,906
<i>regenerates, on average,</i>

3
00:00:08,009 --> 00:00:11,810
<i>every seven years.</i>

4
00:00:11,912 --> 00:00:13,212
<i>Like snakes...</i>

5
00:00:13,314 --> 00:00:17,049
<i>in our own way,
we shed our skin.</i>

6
00:00:17,151 --> 00:00:20,352
<i>Biologically, we're
brand-new people.</i>

7
00:00:20,454 --> 00:00:23,171
Are you visiting
Seattle for the first time?

8
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:26,174
Oh, no, no. I live in Seattle.

9
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:28,143
I just went home for a month.

10
00:00:28,245 --> 00:00:29,845
I took my son to see my parents.

11
00:00:29,947 --> 00:00:32,981
Oh. What do you do in Seattle?

12
00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:35,483
Uh, I'm a surgeon.

13
00:00:37,938 --> 00:00:41,440
Uh, uh, did you know
any of those doctors...

14
00:00:41,525 --> 00:00:45,861
from that shooting?

15
00:00:45,963 --> 00:00:49,698
<i>We may look the
same. We probably do.</i>

16
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,667
<i>The change isn't visible...</i>

17
00:00:52,769 --> 00:00:55,503
<i>at least not in most of us.</i>

18
00:00:55,605 --> 00:00:57,339
<i>But we're all changed...</i>

19
00:00:57,441 --> 00:00:59,208
<i>completely...</i>

20
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:01,043
<i>forever.</i>

21
00:01:01,145 --> 00:01:02,444
But that's normal.

22
00:01:02,546 --> 00:01:05,414
I mean, it's a biological
imperative, change.

23
00:01:05,516 --> 00:01:08,433
So the shooting
changed me. I'm changed.

24
00:01:08,535 --> 00:01:11,336
But I'm also ready
to get back to work.

25
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:13,667
I mean, as ready
as any of us are.

26
00:01:13,691 --> 00:01:15,540
Sitting around the house,

27
00:01:15,642 --> 00:01:16,791
waiting...

28
00:01:16,894 --> 00:01:18,993
I just spend my time worrying.

29
00:01:19,095 --> 00:01:22,297
Your husband was shot.
That's a lot to worry about.

30
00:01:22,399 --> 00:01:23,519
I'm worried about Cristina.

31
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:25,077
She's getting married,
and that's just...

32
00:01:25,101 --> 00:01:27,435
Well, I had to cut her out
of her last wedding dress

33
00:01:27,537 --> 00:01:30,622
with scissors, so...

34
00:01:30,724 --> 00:01:32,791
You watched your
husband get shot.

35
00:01:32,893 --> 00:01:35,961
He's fine. He's coming
back to work today, actually.

36
00:01:41,218 --> 00:01:42,517
We're all fine.

37
00:01:45,506 --> 00:01:46,888
Uh, ex... Excuse me.

38
00:01:52,596 --> 00:01:54,563
Is everything OK, Dr. Grey?

39
00:01:54,665 --> 00:01:57,932
Yes. Yes. Everything's fine.

40
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:02,137
Opening two.

41
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:03,649
It doesn't look too bad.

42
00:02:03,673 --> 00:02:04,951
You just gotta
keep an eye on it,

43
00:02:04,975 --> 00:02:06,285
make sure it doesn't
get any bigger.

44
00:02:06,309 --> 00:02:07,987
But if it changes color,
you should see a doctor.

45
00:02:08,011 --> 00:02:10,078
Dr. Shepherd.

46
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:13,265
Your lady looks pissed.

47
00:02:13,367 --> 00:02:16,969
Again, Derek?

48
00:02:25,846 --> 00:02:27,212
Whew.

49
00:02:29,016 --> 00:02:31,183
What?

50
00:02:31,285 --> 00:02:35,087
Nothin'. Just... you're awesome.

51
00:02:38,025 --> 00:02:39,824
Chief.

52
00:02:39,926 --> 00:02:42,443
Oh, Dr. Bailey. Welcome back.

53
00:02:42,545 --> 00:02:45,563
- Thank you, sir.
- We missed you here.

54
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:48,650
The place isn't the... same.

55
00:02:50,637 --> 00:02:52,599
Did you get cleared for surgery?

56
00:02:52,623 --> 00:02:55,857
What do you mean, "cleared for
surgery"? Who has to clear me?

57
00:02:55,959 --> 00:02:57,859
Well, the next time,
I'll leave you there.

58
00:02:57,961 --> 00:03:00,428
- You said that already.
- Oh, Derek got arrested again.

59
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:01,741
- Meredith...
- Reckless endangerment.

60
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:03,342
- Please.
- Did he lose his license yet?

61
00:03:03,366 --> 00:03:06,567
Oh, no, because they don't charge
him, because the cops worship him.

62
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:08,014
Because I saved
some of their lives.

63
00:03:08,038 --> 00:03:09,337
What are we picking?

64
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,305
Dress color. I'm
not wearing white.

65
00:03:11,407 --> 00:03:14,375
It's sexist and...
vaguely racist.

66
00:03:14,477 --> 00:03:16,210
No white, no veil, no rice.

67
00:03:16,312 --> 00:03:17,690
Well, what will your mother say?

68
00:03:17,714 --> 00:03:18,714
No mother.

69
00:03:18,749 --> 00:03:20,459
I didn't get
cleared for surgery,

70
00:03:20,483 --> 00:03:22,161
and I'm pretty
sure it's your fault.

71
00:03:22,185 --> 00:03:24,865
- Meredith, I am the chief. I can overrule the counselor.
- You can?

72
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:26,398
- Yes.
- I love the blue.

73
00:03:26,422 --> 00:03:27,767
- Chief Shepherd, you're back.
- Good morning.

74
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,802
I found a giant skull
base chordoma.

75
00:03:29,826 --> 00:03:31,559
- Biggest one I've ever seen.
- Really?

76
00:03:31,662 --> 00:03:34,474
- Kid came in to the E.R. with trouble breathing.
- You got cleared for surgery?

77
00:03:34,498 --> 00:03:36,075
- I did.
- Bitch.

78
00:03:36,099 --> 00:03:38,277
- I like the brown, too.
- I know it looks inoperable.

79
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:39,629
I mean, I would've
said it was inoperable,

80
00:03:39,653 --> 00:03:42,353
- but you're back
and you're you.
- Right.

81
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:47,642
Hey, uh, yes, good morning.
Thank you. Thank you very much.

82
00:03:49,112 --> 00:03:50,962
Good. Thank you.
Thank you very much.

83
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,909
It's, uh, it's great to
be back. First of all,

84
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:56,401
I'd like to thank Dr. Webber for
stepping up in my absence. Thank you.

85
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:01,773
I'm grateful for all of
you, for all of your support

86
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:03,525
during my recovery. Thank you.

87
00:04:03,644 --> 00:04:06,728
Uh, it's just, uh, so
great to be back as chief.

88
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:09,981
I'm grateful for the, uh...

89
00:04:11,785 --> 00:04:13,652
I'm sorry. That's a lie.

90
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:16,871
That's what people say,
and, uh, the truth is...

91
00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:21,275
I hate being chief. I hate it.

92
00:04:25,048 --> 00:04:27,616
Chief Webber...

93
00:04:29,052 --> 00:04:31,035
Chief Webber is our chief.

94
00:04:31,137 --> 00:04:32,837
Um...

95
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,440
and I'm sorry, but this giant...

96
00:04:35,542 --> 00:04:37,509
Sorry, I gotta go
look at this chordoma.

97
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:40,312
I, um, I'm sorry, but...

98
00:04:40,414 --> 00:04:41,863
I quit.

99
00:04:44,251 --> 00:04:46,951
- Let's go, Kepner. Come on.
- Oh, sorry. OK.

100
00:04:47,053 --> 00:04:49,388
He just quit.

101
00:04:52,359 --> 00:04:54,842
He was supposed to
clear me for surgery.

102
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,649
Yeah.

103
00:05:00,751 --> 00:05:02,278
The bullet's at the surface.

104
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,382
That's good. I
can take it out now.

105
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:07,455
Nah. I mean, if it's not
infected, I'm gonna keep it.

106
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:10,225
It's my war wound.

107
00:05:11,095 --> 00:05:13,828
Besides... chicks dig that crap.

108
00:05:24,391 --> 00:05:25,623
Oh, my God.

109
00:05:25,726 --> 00:05:28,893
- Mm-hmm.
- Wow. You weren't kidding.

110
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:31,062
The last surgeon broke the dura,

111
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:33,198
which enabled the tumor
to mushroom into the brain

112
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,711
- and down into the spine.
- It's wrapped around
his brain stem.

113
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:38,619
Whatever we do, we
need to do it quickly.

114
00:05:38,721 --> 00:05:40,439
The size of this thing...

115
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:43,024
Normally, I open up the
sinuses or the hard palate.

116
00:05:43,127 --> 00:05:45,143
Well, now you have
to open up both.

117
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:48,863
You want me to split
his whole face open?

118
00:05:48,966 --> 00:05:52,033
Sinuses, hard
palate, tongue, jaw...

119
00:05:52,135 --> 00:05:54,385
A broken jaw is excruciating,
let alone the rest of it.

120
00:05:54,487 --> 00:05:56,504
Does this kid know
what he's in for?

121
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:59,324
He wants to live. I don't think
he's concerned about the pain.

122
00:05:59,426 --> 00:06:01,893
Well, but you don't know
how enmeshed the tumor is.

123
00:06:01,995 --> 00:06:04,307
- You don't even know
if you can get it all.
- Thank you, Dr. Grey.

124
00:06:04,331 --> 00:06:07,443
You want to try this thing, Torres
and I are gonna need to coordinate.

125
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:09,484
What are we thinking, a week?

126
00:06:09,586 --> 00:06:10,835
No later.

127
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:12,236
I'll clear my schedule.

128
00:06:12,338 --> 00:06:14,906
- Welcome back, Dr. Shepherd.
- Thank you, Dr. Torres.

129
00:06:15,008 --> 00:06:17,859
You're not even
cleared for surgery yet.

130
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:21,163
I'll get cleared.

131
00:06:32,409 --> 00:06:34,292
Hey, hey, hey.

132
00:06:44,855 --> 00:06:45,975
Uh, Dr. Grey.

133
00:06:46,056 --> 00:06:47,105
Chief Webber.

134
00:06:47,207 --> 00:06:49,106
Yeah, a little...
little exercise.

135
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:50,208
OK.

136
00:06:50,294 --> 00:06:52,271
Mm. Something I can do for you?

137
00:06:52,295 --> 00:06:55,230
Yeah. Um, that stupid
counselor Perkins,

138
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:57,365
he won't clear me for surgery.

139
00:06:57,484 --> 00:07:00,034
- So I was just wondering...
- No.

140
00:07:00,136 --> 00:07:02,470
- But he cleared...
- I'm... I'm sorry. I am.

141
00:07:02,572 --> 00:07:04,522
But we brought in the best,

142
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:07,092
and when Andrew Perkins
says you're not cleared,

143
00:07:07,194 --> 00:07:10,228
then it's him you
need to talk to.

144
00:07:18,871 --> 00:07:21,689
Yeah, yeah.

145
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,911
Did you hear that Dr. Yang
and Dr. Hunt are getting married?

146
00:07:26,013 --> 00:07:29,681
- I did.
- It's pretty great, huh?

147
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:31,327
It's almost like
a silver lining.

148
00:07:31,351 --> 00:07:33,312
You know, I... I've
read a lot about trauma

149
00:07:33,336 --> 00:07:35,236
and how, uh, sometimes people

150
00:07:35,338 --> 00:07:37,588
just up and change their lives.

151
00:07:37,691 --> 00:07:39,407
They say that the trauma

152
00:07:39,509 --> 00:07:41,353
was the best thing that
could've happened to them.

153
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:43,277
You know, like
Dr. Shepherd this morning.

154
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:46,164
Did you hear that
he's not chief anymore?

155
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:48,833
And how have you been, Dr. Grey?

156
00:07:48,935 --> 00:07:52,454
You've been through a
lot since I last saw you.

157
00:07:55,825 --> 00:08:00,161
Does, uh, anyone
have anything to say?

158
00:08:00,263 --> 00:08:02,914
I know that, uh, a lot of you

159
00:08:03,016 --> 00:08:05,884
are only here because
this has been mandated.

160
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:08,586
So let's talk.

161
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:15,192
Anything at all?

162
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:17,145
I ate a really good taco

163
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:19,781
from one of those trucks
by the side of the road.

164
00:08:19,883 --> 00:08:22,233
- When?
- Last night. You were asleep.

165
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,380
- Which truck? The one on 7th?
- I want to go. I like tacos.

166
00:08:24,404 --> 00:08:28,139
- Me, too.
- I read a book...

167
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:31,525
about the history of
mass murders in the U.S.

168
00:08:31,627 --> 00:08:33,673
That's... that's the actual
name of what happened to us.

169
00:08:33,697 --> 00:08:36,498
It was a mass murder. You
can't call it a terrorist attack,

170
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,511
because the murders
weren't political in nature.

171
00:08:38,535 --> 00:08:40,146
And we weren't the
victims of a serial killer,

172
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:42,636
because Mr. Clark would've
had to murder several people

173
00:08:42,738 --> 00:08:44,467
over a period longer than
30 days in order to qualify

174
00:08:44,491 --> 00:08:48,310
as a serial killer. We
could call it a spree killing...

175
00:08:48,428 --> 00:08:50,289
which is defined as killings
at two or more locations

176
00:08:50,313 --> 00:08:51,874
with no break or
pause in between,

177
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:53,860
because Mr. Clark shot that
guy in his car before he got here.

178
00:08:53,884 --> 00:08:57,452
But I'm not sure that that
counts as a true second location

179
00:08:57,554 --> 00:08:59,521
since it was so
close to the hospital,

180
00:08:59,623 --> 00:09:00,950
which means that we
were a mass murder,

181
00:09:00,974 --> 00:09:03,324
because it happened at
one place, by one person,

182
00:09:03,426 --> 00:09:05,710
and more than four
people were killed.

183
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:17,589
Oh, that was quite
a show this morning.

184
00:09:17,691 --> 00:09:18,590
I didn't plan it.

185
00:09:18,692 --> 00:09:20,532
Made it better. Any regrets?

186
00:09:20,627 --> 00:09:22,460
No. Any regrets about
proposing to Cristina?

187
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,095
None.

188
00:09:24,197 --> 00:09:27,465
Getting shot turns out to
not be the worst thing after all.

189
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,868
I need a best man.

190
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:31,336
I... I know...

191
00:09:31,438 --> 00:09:33,554
I know we're not
that close, but...

192
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:38,092
I don't know. You being
married to the other twisted sister,

193
00:09:38,194 --> 00:09:40,378
I... I just thought it...

194
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,108
It kinda made us like
brothers or something.

195
00:09:42,132 --> 00:09:45,116
- I'd be honored. It's an honor.
- Thank you.

196
00:09:45,218 --> 00:09:46,512
- You need a bachelor party?
- No, no, no.

197
00:09:46,536 --> 00:09:49,320
Even better.

198
00:09:50,991 --> 00:09:53,324
On the, uh, day of the shooting,

199
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:57,145
I understand that you had
a particularly difficult day.

200
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:04,785
On the day I gave
birth to my son,

201
00:10:04,887 --> 00:10:09,257
my husband had a car crash,
and he needed a craniotomy,

202
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:12,143
and he almost died on
Derek Shepherd's table.

203
00:10:12,245 --> 00:10:15,713
Now that was a
particularly difficult day.

204
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:18,350
And at the end of that
day, my son was born,

205
00:10:18,452 --> 00:10:21,769
and my husband lived.

206
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:25,806
But at the end of this day...

207
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:29,177
the, uh...

208
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:32,397
<i>Unh!</i>

209
00:10:32,482 --> 00:10:34,632
<i>No! No!</i>

210
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:36,701
Um... this day

211
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:40,471
was the worst day of my life.

212
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:43,708
Miranda.

213
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:47,011
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

214
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:49,947
No, you... you don't just
sneak up on people. OK?

215
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:52,133
- You don't...
- I got these.

216
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:54,669
I was, um, I was playing golf.

217
00:10:54,771 --> 00:10:56,938
My phone was off, and I'm...

218
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:01,275
You know, 18 people got
shot, 11 died, one in my arms.

219
00:11:01,377 --> 00:11:05,146
A boy died in my arms,
and you were playing golf.

220
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:07,315
- OK.
- Bailey...

221
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:09,257
We gotta go.

222
00:11:09,286 --> 00:11:10,184
Well, where... where you going?

223
00:11:10,286 --> 00:11:13,688
Home, uh, to my mom. Right?

224
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:15,957
Yeah? We're gonna
go see Grandma?

225
00:11:16,059 --> 00:11:17,759
Yeah, Tuck. Here you go.

226
00:11:17,861 --> 00:11:19,494
When you coming back?

227
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:23,264
OK, here, here. Here's your car.

228
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:27,969
Miranda... when are
you coming back?

229
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:32,173
OK, OK, OK, OK.

230
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:34,375
OK, Tuck.

231
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:44,602
No. No.

232
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,170
M... mom.

233
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:48,723
You're talking about
slicing his face in half,

234
00:11:48,825 --> 00:11:50,686
breaking his jaw,
cutting his tongue.

235
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:53,611
It's just... It just
sounds crazy.

236
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:55,713
I know.

237
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:59,751
I wish I could offer some
comfort, but honestly,

238
00:11:59,853 --> 00:12:02,887
there's no comfort that can
be offered in this situation.

239
00:12:02,989 --> 00:12:05,223
Let me just say that...

240
00:12:05,325 --> 00:12:07,742
every medical advancement
started with the statement,

241
00:12:07,844 --> 00:12:10,594
"That sounds crazy."

242
00:12:10,696 --> 00:12:12,680
Let me try.

243
00:12:12,782 --> 00:12:15,466
Donna, let me help.

244
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:24,842
OK. Let's try.

245
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:27,595
Let's... OK.

246
00:12:27,697 --> 00:12:29,397
Good. OK.

247
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:32,383
He could not wake up.

248
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:35,769
He could... wake up...

249
00:12:35,872 --> 00:12:38,222
and never be able to move again.

250
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:39,690
He could go blind.

251
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:42,760
He could lose his
ability to speak or to eat.

252
00:12:42,862 --> 00:12:45,630
He could require
around-the-clock care

253
00:12:45,732 --> 00:12:46,798
for the rest of his life.

254
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,300
He could be in a
tremendous amount of pain

255
00:12:49,402 --> 00:12:51,302
for the rest of his life.

256
00:12:51,404 --> 00:12:53,888
He could die on the table.

257
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:56,791
If that doesn't happen, if
none of those things happen,

258
00:12:56,893 --> 00:12:58,760
he's still facing months

259
00:12:58,862 --> 00:13:02,429
of excruciatingly painful
recovery from this surgery.

260
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:04,498
And before you make a decision,

261
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,152
you need to
understand the risks.

262
00:13:16,762 --> 00:13:18,662
You're driving awfully
fast, Dr. Shepherd.

263
00:13:18,764 --> 00:13:21,933
The least you could
do is wear a seat belt.

264
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:26,704
You've been working.

265
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,923
In the clinic, in the pit.

266
00:13:29,025 --> 00:13:31,392
We haven't been
allowed to operate,

267
00:13:31,494 --> 00:13:34,145
which makes zero
sense if you ask me.

268
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:40,451
I'd like to, uh, talk to you
about the incident last week.

269
00:13:41,253 --> 00:13:43,754
She's not my responsibility.

270
00:13:43,857 --> 00:13:46,106
- She was your girlfriend.
- Well, she's not anymore.

271
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:52,763
Karev, give me another suture.

272
00:13:52,866 --> 00:13:54,999
My patient didn't
bring her meds.

273
00:13:55,101 --> 00:13:56,984
She doesn't even
know their names.

274
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:59,220
I... if I give her albuterol
and she's on propanolol,

275
00:13:59,322 --> 00:14:01,416
then she'll stop breathing.
If... if I give her warfarin

276
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,242
and she's on ibuprofen, then
she'll... then she'll bleed out.

277
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:06,973
If I give her diphenhydramine and
she's on doxepin, then she'll die.

278
00:14:06,997 --> 00:14:09,914
- So do... do... do
you think she wants to die?
- Is she kidding?

279
00:14:09,999 --> 00:14:12,683
- Karev, what's going on
over there?
- I think that she wants to die.

280
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:14,535
I think she wants
me to kill her.

281
00:14:14,637 --> 00:14:17,571
Do... do you... do you...
do you want me to kill you?

282
00:14:17,691 --> 00:14:19,957
Because you... you
could just get a gun,

283
00:14:20,042 --> 00:14:22,171
- and it would be a lot faster.
- Karev, get her outta here.

284
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:24,779
You know what? So why
doesn't somebody find a gun...

285
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,543
- and we'll bring her a gun
and just shoot her...
- Karev, help her.

286
00:14:27,567 --> 00:14:29,617
I can't step away.
Get her out of here!

287
00:14:29,719 --> 00:14:32,197
- Help! Somebody find her a gun
'cause she wants to die!
- I got my own stuff to do.

288
00:14:32,221 --> 00:14:33,604
Somebody find something!

289
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:36,140
Why did you walk away?

290
00:14:36,243 --> 00:14:38,109
Look, life is too short.

291
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:40,144
I almost died trying
to stop that guy.

292
00:14:40,247 --> 00:14:42,113
Besides, I mean...

293
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:44,115
you know how much
tail you get offered

294
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:47,151
when you're carrying a
bullet around in your chest?

295
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:49,020
It's like I'm a legend.

296
00:14:49,122 --> 00:14:52,490
Are you, uh...
always this crass,

297
00:14:52,592 --> 00:14:54,826
or is that a defense mechanism?

298
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:03,551
I've had too much
crazy for one lifetime.

299
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:06,187
You cleared Lexie
Grey for surgery?

300
00:15:06,289 --> 00:15:08,467
Dr. Sloan, I'm
in... I'm in session.

301
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:10,824
I had to check her
into psych last week.

302
00:15:10,926 --> 00:15:13,510
I had to commit
her against her will!

303
00:15:13,612 --> 00:15:16,798
And you just clear
her for surgery?

304
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:19,934
What the hell kind
of doctor are you?

305
00:15:21,704 --> 00:15:23,888
It's OK. You can talk to him.

306
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:27,708
- I'll come back.
- Yeah, walk away.

307
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:30,261
You're good at that.

308
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:34,147
She got snowed.

309
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:38,068
Psych put her on heavy doses
of antipsychotics and benzos.

310
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:41,155
And then she slept for
almost 50 hours straight.

311
00:15:41,257 --> 00:15:42,468
When she woke up,

312
00:15:42,492 --> 00:15:45,726
she was no longer a
risk to herself or others.

313
00:15:45,828 --> 00:15:48,712
I mean, she has
P.T.S.D. Most of you do.

314
00:15:48,814 --> 00:15:51,149
For her, it caused
severe sleep deprivation

315
00:15:51,251 --> 00:15:52,817
and led to a breakdown.

316
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:55,219
All she needed was sleep.

317
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:57,738
So protocol is that
she goes back to work.

318
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,090
See?

319
00:15:59,192 --> 00:16:01,492
I'm OK.

320
00:16:01,594 --> 00:16:04,978
Really. I'm back.

321
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:09,050
Clamp.

322
00:16:09,152 --> 00:16:12,453
So how are you? I
hear there's a guy.

323
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:14,355
Yeah, there's a guy.

324
00:16:14,457 --> 00:16:15,484
Mm. That good?

325
00:16:15,508 --> 00:16:17,441
Shut up.

326
00:16:17,544 --> 00:16:19,960
I need another clamp.

327
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:22,530
So... you're getting married.

328
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:25,415
I am. I am getting married.

329
00:16:25,518 --> 00:16:28,469
I'm happy for you.

330
00:16:29,872 --> 00:16:31,055
I am, really.

331
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:32,856
- Really?
- Yeah.

332
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:34,478
- Thank you.
- Good.

333
00:16:34,544 --> 00:16:37,628
I dig weddings. I do a
mean chicken dance.

334
00:16:37,731 --> 00:16:39,880
Oh, there will be
no chicken dance.

335
00:16:39,982 --> 00:16:43,317
And if you start a conga line,
I will physically throw you out.

336
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:45,453
I just went to the cafeteria,

337
00:16:45,555 --> 00:16:47,388
and some nurse called me Reed

338
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:49,507
and then said, "I
thought you died."

339
00:16:49,609 --> 00:16:51,070
Yeah, you don't go to
the cafeteria for lunch.

340
00:16:51,094 --> 00:16:55,045
- They just point and stare.
- Is that why you
dyed your hair?

341
00:16:55,131 --> 00:16:57,765
They stare because
we should've died.

342
00:16:57,867 --> 00:16:59,834
Pack a lunch. Keep
it in your locker.

343
00:17:05,007 --> 00:17:06,957
You are kidding me.

344
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:10,127
<i>- </i> You got cleared?
- It's down
to you and Yang.

345
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:13,280
- That is not funny.
- - Well, Perkins is no dummy.

346
00:17:13,382 --> 00:17:16,016
He can see the crazy right
under the Meredith Grey surface.

347
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:18,836
Again, Cristina, it's not
funny because you're not

348
00:17:18,938 --> 00:17:20,099
gonna get cleared
either, and the two of us

349
00:17:20,123 --> 00:17:22,073
are gonna be serving
slushies at the multiplex.

350
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:25,258
Really? I'd choose
dermatology over multiplex.

351
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:27,556
No, I'd go gynecology
over dermatology.

352
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:29,830
Oh, of course you would. Perv.

353
00:17:29,932 --> 00:17:32,383
I think I'd go with psych.

354
00:17:35,004 --> 00:17:37,138
That was a joke.

355
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,423
That was good.

356
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:40,986
- Ha ha.
- That was good.

357
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:42,654
Anyway, I don't know what
Perkins' problem is with me.

358
00:17:42,678 --> 00:17:44,545
Maybe he saw your file.

359
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:47,393
- Maybe he knew your mother.
- Maybe he heard how you told
the shooter to shoot you.

360
00:17:47,417 --> 00:17:49,383
Not funny.

361
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:51,502
Not a joke.

362
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:55,723
- Dr. Bailey.
- Welcome back.

363
00:17:57,509 --> 00:17:59,293
You OK?

364
00:18:01,597 --> 00:18:04,031
I'm happy to see you all.

365
00:18:05,385 --> 00:18:08,235
Karev, there's a
patient in 23-04

366
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:09,737
that needs an endoscopy.

367
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:12,473
Grey and Yang, surely your
paycheck covers more than

368
00:18:12,575 --> 00:18:14,415
stuffing your face
in the basement.

369
00:18:14,477 --> 00:18:16,143
Get to the clinic now.

370
00:18:16,245 --> 00:18:17,911
And, you two...

371
00:18:19,365 --> 00:18:23,183
I'm awful sorry about
the loss of your friends.

372
00:18:24,337 --> 00:18:25,786
Thank you.

373
00:18:25,888 --> 00:18:27,221
So are we.

374
00:18:28,307 --> 00:18:31,358
22-13 has a bowel impaction,

375
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:34,711
and I'm sure as hell not about
to stick my hands in there.

376
00:18:41,337 --> 00:18:44,956
You, uh, quit your
job this morning.

377
00:18:45,058 --> 00:18:47,308
Should I be worried
about impulsivity?

378
00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:51,762
I didn't quit my job.

379
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:53,964
Being chief wasn't my job.

380
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:55,916
I'm a surgeon.

381
00:18:56,018 --> 00:18:58,536
That's what I do.
That is who I am.

382
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:00,237
But before you got shot...

383
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:02,773
Oh, I wanted to quit that job
every day before I got shot,

384
00:19:02,876 --> 00:19:05,676
I just didn't have
the guts to do it.

385
00:19:05,778 --> 00:19:07,594
After I got shot, I, uh...

386
00:19:09,749 --> 00:19:13,300
Life is short.

387
00:19:15,004 --> 00:19:18,105
So now I think less and...

388
00:19:18,207 --> 00:19:19,723
just do.

389
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:25,512
So... for you, the
shooting was clarifying?

390
00:19:32,021 --> 00:19:34,788
A... a lot of people
died in that shooting.

391
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:37,140
I'm saying, in your life today.

392
00:19:37,243 --> 00:19:39,810
A lot of people died.

393
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:46,250
Oh.

394
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:47,834
Um...

395
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:49,915
Meredith went to
get something to eat.

396
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:52,890
She should be back soon.

397
00:19:52,992 --> 00:19:54,625
Um...

398
00:19:54,727 --> 00:19:56,961
I'm sorry I got you shot.

399
00:19:58,581 --> 00:20:02,149
By coming out of the office I
didn't listen, and then you got shot.

400
00:20:02,251 --> 00:20:04,134
I... I got you shot,

401
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:06,214
- and I just need to say,
I am so...
- April...

402
00:20:06,238 --> 00:20:07,705
So sorry.

403
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:10,708
Gary Clark came here for me.

404
00:20:12,478 --> 00:20:15,346
I gave the order to
pull the plug on his wife.

405
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,517
I got everyone shot.

406
00:20:50,216 --> 00:20:52,416
So... Oh!

407
00:20:52,502 --> 00:20:54,534
Is this what I need
to do to get cleared?

408
00:20:54,636 --> 00:20:56,537
Dr. Grey, you're early.

409
00:20:56,639 --> 00:20:59,340
I'll, uh, I'll call you later.

410
00:20:59,442 --> 00:21:00,941
Yes, please.

411
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:05,796
Uh...

412
00:21:05,881 --> 00:21:09,132
That was creepy
and inappropriate.

413
00:21:09,234 --> 00:21:10,514
I want a new counselor.

414
00:21:10,586 --> 00:21:13,371
Teddy was never
a... a patient of mine.

415
00:21:13,473 --> 00:21:16,507
She was cleared for
surgery before I got here.

416
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:18,376
We just met in the cafeteria.

417
00:21:18,478 --> 00:21:20,673
I'm not interested
in your love life.

418
00:21:20,697 --> 00:21:24,014
I don't care how love
blooms over day-old hot dogs.

419
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:27,117
My husband is about to remove
the largest chordoma on record.

420
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:29,453
You cleared Lexie
Grey last week.

421
00:21:29,555 --> 00:21:31,533
You cleared Alex
Karev, who insists on

422
00:21:31,557 --> 00:21:34,036
running around the hospital
with a bullet in his chest.

423
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,276
I know who I've cleared.

424
00:21:35,378 --> 00:21:37,778
So then why don't you tell
me what you want me to say,

425
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,596
and I'll say it.

426
00:21:39,698 --> 00:21:42,048
Dr. Grey, I don't think
that you're being honest...

427
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:44,618
with me or yourself.

428
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,704
And I think that's a
potentially dangerous situation.

429
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:51,275
So what is it that
you're not saying?

430
00:21:52,911 --> 00:21:54,678
Who's with Derek?

431
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:57,381
Uh, when I left, um,
Mark Sloan was with him.

432
00:21:57,483 --> 00:21:59,967
- And where's Owen?
- Um, I don't know.

433
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:02,837
I... I... I think he's still
talking to the police.

434
00:22:02,939 --> 00:22:05,639
OK, not a word of this to Derek.

435
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:07,591
You have to tell Owen
because he knows.

436
00:22:07,693 --> 00:22:09,309
- Not a word.
- OK.

437
00:22:09,412 --> 00:22:11,645
And April Kepner.
She knows, too.

438
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:13,564
OK.

439
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:15,332
Well, go... go tell them.

440
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:17,785
Go... go back to the hospital
and tell them right now.

441
00:22:17,887 --> 00:22:20,487
Don't you want
me to stay for this?

442
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:21,739
No, I want you to go.

443
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:24,992
Go and... and make sure
no one says a word to Derek.

444
00:22:25,094 --> 00:22:27,928
OK. OK.

445
00:22:43,346 --> 00:22:45,512
Your friend left?

446
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:48,164
- You want me to wait or...
- No, just do it.

447
00:22:48,267 --> 00:22:50,166
The D&C's pretty
straightforward.

448
00:22:50,269 --> 00:22:52,603
The fetus was only
at about 5 weeks.

449
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:55,405
You'll feel some cramping
after, but it shouldn't be too bad.

450
00:22:58,827 --> 00:23:02,546
Andrew and I just got
busted by Meredith Grey.

451
00:23:02,648 --> 00:23:05,299
- Callie's watching me sleep.
- What?

452
00:23:05,401 --> 00:23:07,601
She's watching me sleep.

453
00:23:07,703 --> 00:23:09,703
And she only watches me
sleep when something is up,

454
00:23:09,772 --> 00:23:11,538
and I'm afraid that
she's gonna propose

455
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,974
or... start talking about
making babies again,

456
00:23:14,076 --> 00:23:16,626
which I'm... I'm
open to, honestly,

457
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:19,796
just not right now, you know?

458
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:22,466
And I can feel her watching
me, and it is such hard work

459
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:24,728
to keep my eyes closed,
but I know that if I open them,

460
00:23:24,804 --> 00:23:27,215
that something loaded is gonna
come out of her beautiful mouth

461
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:29,150
and pop the pretty pink bubble
that we've been floating in.

462
00:23:29,174 --> 00:23:32,376
- You want to pop the bubble.
- I don't, though.

463
00:23:32,478 --> 00:23:34,456
Believe me. I've been
living in that bubble for years.

464
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,314
Oh, no. Owen and I?
We're just friends, really.

465
00:23:37,417 --> 00:23:40,433
Finally knowing the
truth? I don't regret that.

466
00:23:40,535 --> 00:23:44,104
My bubble is so
pink and so... pretty.

467
00:23:46,141 --> 00:23:47,741
Pop the bubble.

468
00:23:49,996 --> 00:23:53,330
I heard you were looking for me.

469
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:55,765
The board officially
reinstated me this morning.

470
00:23:55,867 --> 00:23:59,119
- No more "interim chief."
- Well, I'm glad to hear that.

471
00:23:59,221 --> 00:24:01,788
You sure? No seller's remorse?

472
00:24:01,891 --> 00:24:03,701
Oh, have you seen
the tumor I'm chasing?

473
00:24:03,725 --> 00:24:05,625
No, no seller's remorse.

474
00:24:05,727 --> 00:24:07,007
You feel good
about this surgery?

475
00:24:07,096 --> 00:24:09,274
That sounds like
a loaded question.

476
00:24:09,298 --> 00:24:11,598
Look, I know Perkins
cleared you for surgery.

477
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:14,801
And I know better than to
question your judgment, but...

478
00:24:14,904 --> 00:24:19,706
I still have nightmares, and I
go to two AA meetings a day.

479
00:24:19,808 --> 00:24:22,275
I'm not all the way back,
and I didn't get shot.

480
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:25,846
That's what I mean when I
say, do you feel good about it?

481
00:24:25,948 --> 00:24:27,915
I feel adrenaline.

482
00:24:28,017 --> 00:24:30,717
And, yeah...

483
00:24:30,819 --> 00:24:34,154
the adrenaline feels good.

484
00:25:16,115 --> 00:25:19,400
I can't believe I'm
not down there.

485
00:25:19,502 --> 00:25:23,437
I can't believe I'm
not down there.

486
00:25:28,643 --> 00:25:30,543
Palate's divided.

487
00:25:30,646 --> 00:25:32,212
Torres.

488
00:25:32,314 --> 00:25:34,181
Yeah. OK. We're good.

489
00:25:34,283 --> 00:25:36,500
Here we go.

490
00:25:42,108 --> 00:25:45,008
You ever see anything like this?

491
00:25:45,111 --> 00:25:49,379
I've seen mortar fire that
didn't do this much damage.

492
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:54,017
All right, let's bring
that microscope in

493
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:55,385
and get you started.

494
00:25:55,487 --> 00:25:56,352
Everybody ready?

495
00:25:56,455 --> 00:25:58,405
- Let's do it.
- Yeah.

496
00:26:06,115 --> 00:26:07,814
OK.

497
00:26:07,916 --> 00:26:10,601
There's the tumor.

498
00:26:10,703 --> 00:26:13,336
We're there.
Microdissectors, please.

499
00:26:24,066 --> 00:26:25,399
Get up.

500
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:26,600
No.

501
00:26:26,702 --> 00:26:27,979
Get up.

502
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:28,835
Ow! Ow! Ow!

503
00:26:28,937 --> 00:26:31,138
Let's go.

504
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,739
Sorry, sorry.

505
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:35,225
What is wrong with you?

506
00:26:35,328 --> 00:26:36,827
Everything is wrong.

507
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:39,329
Derek is decapitating
a teenager,

508
00:26:39,432 --> 00:26:41,872
and April Kepner is assisting,

509
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:44,617
and you're sitting reading
about lilies of the freakin' valley.

510
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,269
Well, you prefer peonies?

511
00:26:46,371 --> 00:26:49,122
We are not better.

512
00:26:49,224 --> 00:26:51,135
Cristina, a psychiatrist,
given several opportunities,

513
00:26:51,159 --> 00:26:53,479
has deemed me
unfit to do my job.

514
00:26:53,562 --> 00:26:54,444
Well, he'll get over it.

515
00:26:54,546 --> 00:26:56,029
Just go back in
a couple of days.

516
00:26:56,131 --> 00:26:59,265
- You are not better.
- Well, in a couple of days,
I'll be better, too.

517
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:02,335
In a couple of days,
you'll be married.

518
00:27:04,239 --> 00:27:06,156
Are you trying to
talk me out of this?

519
00:27:06,258 --> 00:27:08,758
Look at me and
tell me you're sure.

520
00:27:08,861 --> 00:27:11,578
OK, you know what? No.
You don't get to do this.

521
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:14,514
OK? All you get to do
is help me break the tie

522
00:27:14,616 --> 00:27:17,217
between the lilies of the valley
and the... and the peonies.

523
00:27:17,319 --> 00:27:19,285
- That's it.
- No, I do get to do this.

524
00:27:19,387 --> 00:27:21,483
I mean, Derek's the love of
my life, but you're my soul mate.

525
00:27:21,507 --> 00:27:24,892
I do get to do this. I mean,
why can't it wait six months?

526
00:27:24,994 --> 00:27:26,855
- Please don't. Don't.
- Your flowers aren't
going anywhere.

527
00:27:26,879 --> 00:27:29,095
You broke up with him
because he couldn't choose you.

528
00:27:29,197 --> 00:27:30,613
Don't... don't... don't do this.

529
00:27:30,716 --> 00:27:32,493
- Just why does it
have to be right now?
- You know what I think?

530
00:27:32,517 --> 00:27:35,685
- I think you should tell Derek
about the miscarriage.
- We're talking about you.

531
00:27:35,787 --> 00:27:37,771
We're talking about
us not being "better."

532
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:40,152
- Then you need to tell him.
- He's not ready. He's... he's not OK.

533
00:27:40,176 --> 00:27:44,394
Well, you're not OK.
You should tell him.

534
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:04,932
Well, Dr. Yang, if you don't
feel ready, there's no pressure.

535
00:28:06,435 --> 00:28:08,885
The hospital is prepared to
work with you in whatever way...

536
00:28:08,987 --> 00:28:11,454
What... I'm sorry. I... I'm
getting special treatment?

537
00:28:11,556 --> 00:28:14,658
'Cause I'm the girl who
operated with a gun to her head?

538
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:17,911
If you don't want to
clear me, don't clear me.

539
00:28:18,013 --> 00:28:20,697
Well, you didn't show up for
your appointment last week.

540
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:22,132
You were very late today.

541
00:28:22,234 --> 00:28:24,151
I'm getting married.

542
00:28:24,253 --> 00:28:26,620
I heard that. Congratulations.

543
00:28:32,745 --> 00:28:34,027
Can I go now?

544
00:28:40,019 --> 00:28:43,770
When you think about
going into an O.R.,

545
00:28:43,872 --> 00:28:45,689
how does that make you feel?

546
00:28:45,791 --> 00:28:48,541
God, the women in
these magazines...

547
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:52,128
Some of them are
actually brides, you know?

548
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:54,063
They're not all models.

549
00:28:54,165 --> 00:28:57,801
All smiling.

550
00:28:57,903 --> 00:28:59,681
It's like the only thing
in the world that matters

551
00:28:59,705 --> 00:29:01,916
is that they find
the perfect shoe

552
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:04,491
to match that dress.

553
00:29:04,593 --> 00:29:06,860
God, you know, I
knew these girls.

554
00:29:06,962 --> 00:29:09,696
I... I went to school with them.

555
00:29:09,798 --> 00:29:12,198
It's funny.

556
00:29:15,838 --> 00:29:18,422
I used to feel sorry for them.

557
00:29:18,524 --> 00:29:21,424
They're simple girls.

558
00:29:21,526 --> 00:29:24,961
They just want to find the guy
and get married, you know...

559
00:29:25,063 --> 00:29:27,347
and live.

560
00:29:29,602 --> 00:29:30,800
I don't know.

561
00:29:30,902 --> 00:29:33,570
I think you're
either born simple

562
00:29:33,672 --> 00:29:35,705
or you're born...

563
00:29:40,613 --> 00:29:43,113
me.

564
00:29:50,489 --> 00:29:52,222
I want to be the person

565
00:29:52,324 --> 00:29:54,858
who gets happy over
finding the perfect dress.

566
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,460
I want to be simple.

567
00:29:59,181 --> 00:30:03,600
'Cause no one holds a gun
to the head of a simple girl.

568
00:30:03,702 --> 00:30:06,837
<i>- Stop fixing him!
- Owen, help.</i>

569
00:30:06,939 --> 00:30:08,755
Who is it?

570
00:30:08,857 --> 00:30:11,875
I... It's me. It's Owen.

571
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:13,476
Hey.

572
00:30:15,648 --> 00:30:17,981
You're late.

573
00:30:18,083 --> 00:30:19,983
I'm sorry.

574
00:30:32,164 --> 00:30:33,463
Hey.

575
00:30:33,565 --> 00:30:35,348
It's not OK.

576
00:30:40,638 --> 00:30:41,788
Cristina, what is this?

577
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:44,357
I don't want to be alone.

578
00:30:46,861 --> 00:30:50,681
You don't ever have
to be alone again.

579
00:30:50,783 --> 00:30:53,199
I'm not going
anywhere, Cristina.

580
00:30:53,302 --> 00:30:55,835
I won't ever leave
again. You hear me?

581
00:30:55,937 --> 00:31:00,890
I am not going
anywhere, Cristina...

582
00:31:03,512 --> 00:31:05,962
if you let me stay.

583
00:31:14,556 --> 00:31:17,056
Thank you.

584
00:31:17,158 --> 00:31:20,026
I'm sorry. I'm sorry I was late.

585
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:22,045
Thank you.

586
00:31:22,147 --> 00:31:24,414
Thank you.

587
00:31:24,516 --> 00:31:27,350
Thank you.

588
00:31:46,755 --> 00:31:50,457
Uh...

589
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:54,477
Miranda, look, um...

590
00:31:56,731 --> 00:31:59,316
Look, um...

591
00:32:03,455 --> 00:32:05,322
I... I was playing golf.

592
00:32:05,424 --> 00:32:08,224
And I... I can't
apologize for it

593
00:32:08,327 --> 00:32:10,371
because it wasn't
anything I did on purpose.

594
00:32:10,395 --> 00:32:12,245
I... I was just...

595
00:32:17,653 --> 00:32:20,053
I was playing golf.

596
00:32:23,058 --> 00:32:25,538
I missed you, and I just...

597
00:32:25,611 --> 00:32:30,513
You're... you're a good man.

598
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:33,399
You are handsome...

599
00:32:33,501 --> 00:32:38,004
and kind... and smart

600
00:32:38,107 --> 00:32:42,175
and... good.

601
00:32:42,277 --> 00:32:44,611
I mean, you're perfect.

602
00:32:44,713 --> 00:32:47,530
But, um...

603
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:51,001
I'm... busy

604
00:32:51,103 --> 00:32:55,422
holding myself together
with tape and glue.

605
00:32:55,524 --> 00:32:59,259
And a piece of me wishes that

606
00:32:59,361 --> 00:33:01,861
you hadn't played
golf, because...

607
00:33:01,963 --> 00:33:06,366
then you'd be all
taped and glued, too.

608
00:33:06,468 --> 00:33:10,253
And maybe you'd be where I am.

609
00:33:10,355 --> 00:33:12,639
- Shh.
- I...

610
00:33:15,727 --> 00:33:17,627
You're...

611
00:33:17,729 --> 00:33:21,398
You're too much
for me right now,

612
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:24,267
'cause I'm busy with
the tape and the glue.

613
00:33:24,369 --> 00:33:26,447
Shh. Shh. All right, all right.

614
00:33:26,471 --> 00:33:28,171
All right.

615
00:33:31,943 --> 00:33:35,545
All right.

616
00:33:46,842 --> 00:33:48,441
You take care of yourself.

617
00:33:48,543 --> 00:33:50,643
You, too.

618
00:34:18,272 --> 00:34:20,553
You were amazing in there.

619
00:34:23,044 --> 00:34:24,594
Let's make a baby.

620
00:34:24,696 --> 00:34:25,762
What?

621
00:34:25,864 --> 00:34:28,131
Mm-hmm. Come on.

622
00:34:28,233 --> 00:34:29,565
Let's just pull the goalie.

623
00:34:29,667 --> 00:34:32,469
Let's do it. Let's
start right now.

624
00:34:32,571 --> 00:34:34,888
Oh, God.

625
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:36,789
It's Greg. Damn it.

626
00:34:43,665 --> 00:34:45,531
I... I already gave
him 10 of morphine.

627
00:34:45,633 --> 00:34:47,912
He's in too much pain. I'm
gonna start him on propofol.

628
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:49,881
- Greg.
- I never should've
let you do this.

629
00:34:49,905 --> 00:34:51,515
- I never should've let you.
- All right, Greg. It's Dr. Shepherd.

630
00:34:51,539 --> 00:34:53,373
You have to listen
to me. Greg. Greg.

631
00:34:53,475 --> 00:34:57,260
Greg, this is the
fight. This is the fight.

632
00:34:57,362 --> 00:34:58,756
It's gonna stop.
We're gonna help you.

633
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:00,592
But until it does,
this is your fight.

634
00:35:00,616 --> 00:35:02,699
The tumor's not driving
anymore. You are.

635
00:35:02,801 --> 00:35:04,935
You're in the driver's seat.

636
00:35:05,037 --> 00:35:09,205
The life that's in your
head, you get if you fight.

637
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:11,457
You got it?

638
00:35:16,398 --> 00:35:19,316
Good. Good.

639
00:35:19,418 --> 00:35:20,633
Look, this...

640
00:35:20,735 --> 00:35:23,019
- This pain?
- Yeah.

641
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:25,238
It's not a dying pain.
It's a healing pain.

642
00:35:25,357 --> 00:35:27,857
- This is a victory pain.
- OK.

643
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:30,209
You won.

644
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:34,631
We won.

645
00:35:58,390 --> 00:36:00,756
Hey.

646
00:36:00,858 --> 00:36:04,143
What? What? I went
out to get some ice.

647
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:05,845
Oh, don't be mad.

648
00:36:05,947 --> 00:36:07,614
We'll make the wedding.

649
00:36:08,516 --> 00:36:10,350
I'll make the wedding.

650
00:36:10,452 --> 00:36:13,152
Just wanted to see you
were alive for myself.

651
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:16,589
Meredith.

652
00:36:18,493 --> 00:36:20,627
Meredith.

653
00:36:45,603 --> 00:36:48,220
You look hot.

654
00:36:48,322 --> 00:36:51,991
The whole, uh, "crazy
eyes, tight dress" thing,

655
00:36:52,093 --> 00:36:54,260
it's, uh, it's working for you,

656
00:36:54,362 --> 00:36:55,612
for whatever it's worth.

657
00:36:57,682 --> 00:37:02,252
You think that you are so
badass 'cause you lived.

658
00:37:02,354 --> 00:37:04,820
I'm the reason that you lived.

659
00:37:04,906 --> 00:37:06,238
And while you were dying,

660
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:09,441
you were crying out
for the wife who left you.

661
00:37:09,544 --> 00:37:13,179
So that's the
opposite of badass,

662
00:37:14,115 --> 00:37:16,315
for whatever it's worth.

663
00:37:24,576 --> 00:37:25,925
I'm jealous.

664
00:37:27,162 --> 00:37:29,623
I think I'm jealous
of Hunt and Yang.

665
00:37:29,647 --> 00:37:31,692
You know Derek's
gonna be the best man?

666
00:37:31,716 --> 00:37:34,567
We hardly even know the guy.

667
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:36,869
I'm gonna do it.

668
00:37:36,971 --> 00:37:38,971
- You're drunk.
- That's why I'm gonna do it.

669
00:37:39,074 --> 00:37:42,241
Lame surgery ran long.
Sorry. What'd I miss?

670
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:45,928
- I have something... to ask you.
- Oh, no.

671
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:48,347
I want you to move
in with me. I love you,

672
00:37:48,449 --> 00:37:51,417
and you have a drawer
and a toothbrush,

673
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:54,253
and I want you to
have a whole dresser

674
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:57,206
and a whole... blow-dryer

675
00:37:57,308 --> 00:38:01,327
or something... more
romantic than that or...

676
00:38:01,429 --> 00:38:02,878
something.

677
00:38:02,981 --> 00:38:04,859
You're doing
great. Push through.

678
00:38:04,883 --> 00:38:06,332
OK.

679
00:38:08,737 --> 00:38:12,805
Unless you're just
totally hating the idea,

680
00:38:12,907 --> 00:38:14,674
which...

681
00:38:14,776 --> 00:38:16,409
would be OK.

682
00:38:16,511 --> 00:38:18,878
- Is that it?
- Is what it?

683
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:20,830
You just want me to move in

684
00:38:20,932 --> 00:38:23,227
to a place that I
basically already live?

685
00:38:23,251 --> 00:38:24,617
Mm-hmm.

686
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:26,731
- Thank God.
- Yes, yes.

687
00:38:26,755 --> 00:38:29,072
Calliope, yes. I would
love to have a dresser

688
00:38:29,174 --> 00:38:31,294
and a blow-dryer or
something more romantic.

689
00:38:34,045 --> 00:38:37,046
Oh. How are you doing? You OK?

690
00:38:37,149 --> 00:38:39,666
Yeah. I'm OK. Uh, Derek?

691
00:38:39,768 --> 00:38:41,912
Uh, I'm sorry. He's not coming.

692
00:38:41,936 --> 00:38:45,271
- Um...
- He's my best man.

693
00:38:45,373 --> 00:38:47,368
I know. Do you want
to pick a new one?

694
00:38:47,392 --> 00:38:50,210
- Mark looks great in a suit.
- Derek had the ring.

695
00:38:50,312 --> 00:38:52,928
- I have it.
- Oh, OK.

696
00:38:53,014 --> 00:38:54,931
OK. Are you still good?

697
00:38:55,033 --> 00:38:56,800
- Yeah.
- OK.

698
00:38:56,902 --> 00:38:59,569
She is gonna come
down those stairs, right?

699
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:12,799
I never gave you any
crap about your Post-it.

700
00:39:21,659 --> 00:39:24,361
You look beautiful.

701
00:39:24,463 --> 00:39:26,896
I know.

702
00:39:26,998 --> 00:39:29,149
How's Owen? Is he good?

703
00:39:29,251 --> 00:39:32,234
Owen's perfect.

704
00:39:33,755 --> 00:39:36,906
He's perfect.

705
00:39:38,676 --> 00:39:40,509
Thank you.

708
00:39:47,652 --> 00:39:50,302

714

723
00:40:51,065 --> 00:40:54,366
<i>instead of forming new ones.</i>

724
00:40:54,468 --> 00:40:57,202

726

730
00:41:15,656 --> 00:41:18,324
<i>It can feel like death...</i>

731
00:41:18,426 --> 00:41:22,495
