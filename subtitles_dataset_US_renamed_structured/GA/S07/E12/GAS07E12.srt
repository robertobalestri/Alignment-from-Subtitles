1
00:00:02,285 --> 00:00:03,963
<i>People are really romantic</i>

2
00:00:03,987 --> 00:00:06,354
<i>about the beginnings of things.</i>

3
00:00:06,457 --> 00:00:08,189
<i>Fresh start.</i>

4
00:00:08,291 --> 00:00:10,124
<i>Clean slate.</i>

5
00:00:10,226 --> 00:00:12,411
<i>A world of possibility.</i>

6
00:00:12,513 --> 00:00:16,447
<i>But no matter what new
adventure you're embarking on...</i>

7
00:00:18,568 --> 00:00:20,268
<i>you're still you.</i>

8
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:23,138
Well, I am going to
get ready for work.

9
00:00:23,257 --> 00:00:26,541
- Next time.
- It's not gonna work.

10
00:00:26,644 --> 00:00:29,111
A baby doesn't want to set
up shop in a hostile uterus.

11
00:00:29,213 --> 00:00:32,147
It's gonna happen. We just have
to keep doing it until we get it right.

12
00:00:32,249 --> 00:00:34,015
- Right?
- Right.

13
00:00:34,117 --> 00:00:37,853
<i>You bring you into every
new beginning in your life.</i>

14
00:00:39,356 --> 00:00:42,390
<i>So how different
can it possibly be?</i>

15
00:00:43,059 --> 00:00:45,260
Damn it.

16
00:00:53,903 --> 00:00:57,539
Torres! Come on! Let's go!

17
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:01,576
Coming!

18
00:01:05,249 --> 00:01:07,249
What the hell?

19
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:10,069
Oh! Good morning!

20
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:13,922
- What are you doing here?
- I bought out our subletters.

21
00:01:14,024 --> 00:01:17,142
I'm moving back in. Hooray!

22
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:20,261
They weren't your subletters.
They were my subletters.

23
00:01:20,363 --> 00:01:23,581
Well, now, um,
I'm your subletter.

24
00:01:24,951 --> 00:01:26,601
Hooray?

25
00:01:28,555 --> 00:01:31,006
My lack of interest in
seeing you is not a strategy.

26
00:01:31,108 --> 00:01:34,242
I'm not, uh... I'm not playing
hard to get. I don't want to see you

27
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:38,163
because I turned my life upside
down for you, and you walked away

28
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:42,000
because for a week, I was
cranky. You're untrustworthy,

29
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:44,069
so I don't want to see
you. You're self-centered,

30
00:01:44,171 --> 00:01:47,438
so I don't want to see you.
I am 100 percent certain

31
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:50,675
that if I let you back into my
life again, you will hurt me again.

32
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:55,514
So I don't want to see you.
This isn't a ploy. I'm not pouting.

33
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:58,250
I don't want you in my life!

34
00:01:58,352 --> 00:02:03,739
Get your crap out
of my apartment.

35
00:02:09,079 --> 00:02:13,799
- Hm.
- It's good that she's mad. It means she cares, right?

36
00:02:16,286 --> 00:02:19,488
Try again. Could be a false
negative. Maybe you tried too early.

37
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:21,000
- What is it, day ten?
- Yeah.

38
00:02:21,024 --> 00:02:23,575
Totally early. Pee on a
bunch of different sticks.

39
00:02:23,677 --> 00:02:25,805
- Don't let the one stick win.
- It's a scientific test.

40
00:02:25,829 --> 00:02:27,846
I hardly think I can
bend it to my will.

41
00:02:27,948 --> 00:02:31,316
I'm doing three surgeries today,
did four yesterday. I'm unstoppable.

42
00:02:31,418 --> 00:02:35,553
And you got defeated by a piece
of plastic covered in urine? Buck up.

43
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:36,866
What is this,
everybody got paged?

44
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:38,190
It's that time of year again.

45
00:02:38,292 --> 00:02:41,392
- The chicks have hatched.
- Is that some sort of a code?

46
00:02:42,196 --> 00:02:45,763
Those chicks.

47
00:02:45,849 --> 00:02:49,601
Oh. First year med students.
Too dumb to find the toilet.

48
00:02:49,703 --> 00:02:53,855
Good morning. Behind me stand
the interns and residents of tomorrow.

49
00:02:53,957 --> 00:02:56,591
Today you will show them
what it's like to be a surgeon.

50
00:02:56,693 --> 00:02:59,260
When you go into surgery,
they go into surgery.

51
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,630
When they have a
question, you will answer.

52
00:03:01,732 --> 00:03:03,809
It's like court-ordered
community service.

53
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:06,801
I'd rather be picking up trash
off the side of the highway.

54
00:03:06,903 --> 00:03:09,303
Fred Wilson,
you're with Dr. Yang.

55
00:03:09,405 --> 00:03:11,940
Kira Donnelley, with Dr. Grey.

56
00:03:12,042 --> 00:03:13,925
Hudson Powell, with Dr. Kepner.

57
00:03:14,028 --> 00:03:17,945
- Laurel Pinson...
- Mine.

58
00:03:18,047 --> 00:03:20,132
- Mine.
- Mine.

59
00:03:20,234 --> 00:03:23,551
Laurel, you're with Dr. Karev.

60
00:03:23,653 --> 00:03:27,071
Edward Taylor, Dr. Avery.

61
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:29,886
Really?

62
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,693
- Kim Peterson...
- Hey, man.

63
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:34,763
Dr. Yang. Um...

64
00:03:34,864 --> 00:03:38,166
You were out of the game for a while
so you'll be with me on my service today.

65
00:03:38,268 --> 00:03:41,319
- I'd like to monitor
your progress.
- I think you'll be pleased.

66
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:42,787
I don't doubt it.

67
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:46,040
I will be picking my chief
resident in a few months,

68
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:47,520
and you're still a
prime candidate.

69
00:03:47,544 --> 00:03:49,728
The race for chief
resident is on?

70
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:53,548
- Since when?
- How long have you
been evaluating us?

71
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,700
Since your first day here.

72
00:04:08,198 --> 00:04:11,099
- Sorry.
- When you gotta go,
you gotta go.

73
00:04:11,201 --> 00:04:14,435
OK. We are with, uh,
Shepherd today. He's Neuro.

74
00:04:14,537 --> 00:04:16,354
- Is he nice?
- Uh, he's my husband,

75
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:19,235
so I have to say he's nice. But
he's also a damn good surgeon.

76
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:23,728
Oh, thank God. I'm just glad you're
not one of those "obsessed with my job

77
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:27,665
- but cold
and dead inside," surgeons.
- We have rounds.

78
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:31,786
Henry Burton has Von Hippel-Lindau
disease and a pheochromocytoma.

79
00:04:31,889 --> 00:04:34,409
It's extremely rare, causes
blood pressures to skyrocket

80
00:04:34,457 --> 00:04:37,342
- and it's treated
with alpha blockers.
- Well, look at that. He reads.

81
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:39,311
- Sorry...
- Med students are like children

82
00:04:39,413 --> 00:04:41,141
at the dinner table, to
be seen and not heard.

83
00:04:41,165 --> 00:04:43,682
- Dr. Yang.
- Sir.

84
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:48,103
- Good to see you, Henry.
- Thanks.

85
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:51,907
- I wore my best gown
for the occasion.
- I am Dr. Bailey.

86
00:04:52,009 --> 00:04:53,970
I'll be working with
Dr. Webber today.

87
00:04:53,994 --> 00:04:55,171
I feel like I already
know you, Dr. Bailey.

88
00:04:55,195 --> 00:04:56,706
Eli here has been
telling me all about you.

89
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:58,729
Don't worry, I didn't
tell him everything.

90
00:04:58,832 --> 00:05:04,118
Oh! Hi, I did not know
that you were on this case.

91
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:07,071
- Sure you didn't.
- No, I didn't...

92
00:05:07,173 --> 00:05:10,541
- Bailey?
- Sorry, sir. Um...

93
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:15,730
Where was I? Dr. Yang
will run, uh, scans,

94
00:05:15,832 --> 00:05:19,484
- and then we'll be ready to go.
- Sounds like an idyllic day.

95
00:05:19,586 --> 00:05:21,453
- Who's he?
- Nobody.

96
00:05:21,555 --> 00:05:25,257
I mean, uh, he's... He's
here observing, ignore him.

97
00:05:25,359 --> 00:05:29,944
Mr. Wilson's a first-year med student
and Dr. Yang is showing him the ropes.

98
00:05:30,046 --> 00:05:33,915
Have you told Mr. Wilson about the
most interesting aspects of the case?

99
00:05:34,017 --> 00:05:36,428
- He's been brought up to speed.
- - Did she tell you that Henry here

100
00:05:36,452 --> 00:05:40,438
originally was denied this
surgery because he was uninsured?

101
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:44,809
Um... No. I mean,
she didn't mention...

102
00:05:44,911 --> 00:05:47,628
That's too bad
about the insurance.

103
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:50,482
I got married. I'm on
my wife's insurance now.

104
00:05:50,584 --> 00:05:53,851
Congratulations. Your
girlfriend finally wised up.

105
00:05:53,953 --> 00:05:57,672
- Uh, nope.
- Oh, uh...

106
00:05:57,774 --> 00:06:00,207
Sorry. Um, I'll come back later.

107
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:03,111
No, it's OK, I've got
the, uh, forms right here.

108
00:06:03,213 --> 00:06:05,731
Just a few signatures
and we're good to go.

109
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:08,950
Great, great. Um, I'll have them
back to you in a couple hours.

110
00:06:09,052 --> 00:06:10,585
Great, thanks.

111
00:06:12,055 --> 00:06:15,440
That's my wife. Upgrade, right?

112
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:16,875
The ex was a cater waiter.

113
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:23,898
- Dr. Torres.
- What?

114
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,934
- Nothing.
- Well, you said my name.

115
00:06:27,037 --> 00:06:30,689
Just as a, you know, "Good
morning," type of thing.

116
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:33,474
Where's the stupid meat wagon?

117
00:06:33,576 --> 00:06:36,928
- Morning, Dr. Hunt. Dr...
- Don't.

118
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:44,686
Brady Sullivan, 32,
stable vital signs,

119
00:06:44,788 --> 00:06:48,089
complains of neck and back
pain, possible crush injuries.

120
00:06:48,191 --> 00:06:49,752
- He was trampled by a horse.
- Horse?

121
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:52,677
A team of horses. Like,
three horses, if that helps you.

122
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:55,547
Please, don't let him
die on our wedding day.

123
00:06:57,267 --> 00:06:59,678
- Push five of morphine.
- We were going
downtown this morning

124
00:06:59,702 --> 00:07:02,487
- to sign domestic
partnership papers.
- A lot of bruising here.

125
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:04,767
I had a horse-drawn carriage
to pick us up from City Hall.

126
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:06,835
And bagpipers,
because Brady is Scottish

127
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:08,521
and he really likes
being Scottish.

128
00:07:08,545 --> 00:07:11,012
I feel tenderness in C6.
Get X-Ray in here stat.

129
00:07:11,114 --> 00:07:13,376
Brady, I'm so sorry.
The bagpipers started up,

130
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,445
and they spooked the
horses and they ran...

131
00:07:15,469 --> 00:07:19,020
Over me! They all ran
over me, Kyle! Bagpipes?

132
00:07:19,122 --> 00:07:21,867
Exam shows weakness in lower
extremities, got diminished reflexes.

133
00:07:21,891 --> 00:07:23,841
- Move. I can't work.
- Dude!

134
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:26,322
- Sorry. Sorry.
- I agreed to the tuxes,
but horses?

135
00:07:26,346 --> 00:07:29,096
- It was supposed
to be a surprise.
- It was.

136
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:32,700
OK. Looks like L4 and L5 are affected.
Page Shepherd. Get him ready for CT.

137
00:07:32,802 --> 00:07:34,631
- Sir, I need you
out of here now.
- I want to stay with him.

138
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,915
I have a right to stay with him.

139
00:07:35,939 --> 00:07:38,006
Avery, get him out of here now.

140
00:07:38,108 --> 00:07:39,418
- Move!
- Sorry.

141
00:07:39,442 --> 00:07:41,175
OK, everybody out now!

142
00:07:43,697 --> 00:07:46,147
Now, before I have
to take someone out!

143
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:51,503
You married a patient
to give him insurance?

144
00:07:51,605 --> 00:07:54,739
Have you lost your mind?
Insurance fraud is a serious offense.

145
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:57,069
According to the National
Medical Anti-Fraud Association,

146
00:07:57,093 --> 00:07:59,121
it's not insurance fraud.
It's just frowned upon.

147
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:02,764
It's highly unethical. You're
a doctor, for God's sakes!

148
00:08:02,866 --> 00:08:04,309
The medical community
is fairly split on this.

149
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:06,546
Is it more unethical to deny
a patient life-saving care,

150
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:08,814
or to marry a patient and give
him that care? It can get murky.

151
00:08:08,838 --> 00:08:10,366
Don't you have
somewhere to be, Dr. Grey?

152
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:12,051
I'm on Dr. Altman's
service today.

153
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:13,241
We are doctors.

154
00:08:13,343 --> 00:08:15,994
We save people's lives every
day without marrying them.

155
00:08:16,096 --> 00:08:19,097
- You marry someone you love.
- Well, I love him. I do.

156
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,934
I mean, I love him so much.

157
00:08:23,036 --> 00:08:24,736
Dr. Altman, this isn't a joke.

158
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:28,623
I appreciate your concern, chief.
But it's done. He has insurance.

159
00:08:28,725 --> 00:08:31,559
You're his doctor, and
now you can save his life.

160
00:08:37,467 --> 00:08:40,918
Please don't tell the chief I said this,
but I think what you did was awesome.

161
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:45,240
I mean, I get it. She's got a
hang-up about me being perfect.

162
00:08:45,342 --> 00:08:47,582
Everything comes easy for
me, and I don't have any flaws.

163
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,811
Now that I've clearly made a mistake,
she's gonna pound the crap out of it.

164
00:08:50,931 --> 00:08:54,449
- So you don't
think you're perfect?
- No. I have lots of flaws.

165
00:08:54,551 --> 00:08:56,951
I'm competitive. I'm a workaholic.
I smoke when I'm stressed.

166
00:08:56,987 --> 00:08:59,415
- It's disgusting.
- Sure she'd love
to hear all those.

167
00:08:59,439 --> 00:09:03,575
Along with any other real
faults you come up with.

168
00:09:03,677 --> 00:09:08,062
You were that guy on<i> Seattle Med,</i>
right? Who made a trachea from scratch?

169
00:09:08,164 --> 00:09:11,765
Oh. Stem cells. Not
scratch. But, yeah, that's me.

170
00:09:11,868 --> 00:09:14,969
Bad-ass. I'm really interested
in regenerative medicine.

171
00:09:15,071 --> 00:09:18,806
Yeah? I'll show you a bladder
we're growing in the lab after rounds.

172
00:09:18,908 --> 00:09:20,674
- OK.
- Ladies first.

173
00:09:22,045 --> 00:09:25,713
- You're her teacher, Alex.
- Only for the day.

174
00:09:28,085 --> 00:09:30,535
Sarah Cassidy, 15,

175
00:09:30,637 --> 00:09:33,771
has a rare genetic condition,
called Treacher Collins Syndrome

176
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:35,751
which caused her to be
born without cheekbones,

177
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:39,326
leaving her orbital floor unprotected
and vulnerable to eye injury.

178
00:09:39,428 --> 00:09:42,363
Which means the only
extracurriculars I can sign up for

179
00:09:42,465 --> 00:09:44,510
are the ones that don't
involve things flying at my face.

180
00:09:44,534 --> 00:09:47,735
- She rocks the chess club.
- - I just wanna play sports.

181
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,970
- You bowl, honey.
- Not really a sport, Dad.

182
00:09:50,073 --> 00:09:52,101
Do you mind if I take a look?

183
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:54,041
Scoot over a little
so Laurel can see.

184
00:09:54,143 --> 00:09:56,944
Sarah, we're going to
take pieces from your skull

185
00:09:57,046 --> 00:09:59,880
and transplant them into your
face to rebuild new cheekbones.

186
00:09:59,982 --> 00:10:01,716
Do you have any
questions or concerns?

187
00:10:01,818 --> 00:10:05,378
Volleyball tryouts are in
two months. Can I try out?

188
00:10:08,658 --> 00:10:09,819
Hey.

189
00:10:09,843 --> 00:10:12,576
Sorry I'm late.
Here are the forms.

190
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:14,845
- You are officially insured.
- Amazing.

191
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:18,566
And I have nothing to give you
in return. Wait. Are you hungry?

192
00:10:18,685 --> 00:10:21,002
- You want a fruit cup?
- Henry, you needed insurance.

193
00:10:21,104 --> 00:10:23,622
- I was happy to give it.
- Come on. Take the fruit cup.

194
00:10:24,825 --> 00:10:26,791
Fine. I'm starving.

195
00:10:31,581 --> 00:10:34,210
- That's disgusting.
- I wouldn't eat it
if I were dying.

196
00:10:37,521 --> 00:10:41,906
I should go. Um... Good
luck with your surgery.

197
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:45,443
Thank you, Dr. Altman.

198
00:10:48,514 --> 00:10:50,181
Wow, volleyball player!

199
00:10:50,283 --> 00:10:53,083
Digging into her skull will tack on
an extra year of healing, you know.

200
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:54,830
Maybe she'll play in
a couple years then.

201
00:10:54,854 --> 00:10:57,555
Did you consider the stem
cell surgery they did in Cincinnati

202
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:00,058
- using a cadaver bone graft?
- It's too experimental.

203
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,694
I think it's worth
considering, given her age.

204
00:11:02,779 --> 00:11:06,714
I think considering her age, it's best to
be conservative. I'll see you in surgery.

205
00:11:10,687 --> 00:11:12,687
Can we, uh, go in
and see the scans?

206
00:11:12,789 --> 00:11:14,067
Pretty small room.
Let's just wait.

207
00:11:14,091 --> 00:11:15,601
He's got tandem lesions.

208
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:17,403
A fracture
translocation at L4 and 5

209
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:20,628
and a unilateral jumped
facet at C5 and 6.

210
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:22,842
- What does that mean?
- One of the joints in his neck

211
00:11:22,866 --> 00:11:24,426
was knocked out of place,
and he's got a broken back.

212
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:27,218
- That one's your husband?
- What? Yes.

213
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:31,356
Can I just say, jackpot? You
get to be at work with that all day,

214
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:33,240
and go home to him at night?

215
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:36,605
I'm gonna go see
where they're at.

216
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:38,413
I'm worried about his neck.

217
00:11:38,515 --> 00:11:40,710
I don't think he should be
intubated with a cervical injury.

218
00:11:40,734 --> 00:11:43,484
I could do a little traction. Snap
it back in before we do surgery.

219
00:11:43,586 --> 00:11:45,497
- Hell of a wedding day.
- Hm.

220
00:11:45,521 --> 00:11:48,567
They say if you want to piss
off God, just tell him your plans.

221
00:11:48,591 --> 00:11:50,709
Dude! Out!

222
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:57,215
That's the biggest
pheo I've ever seen.

223
00:11:57,316 --> 00:12:01,102
- Is it infiltrating
the kidney there?
- That's the spleen, right?

224
00:12:01,204 --> 00:12:03,003
- No, that's the liver.
- Oh.

225
00:12:03,105 --> 00:12:06,441
- OK. Is that the tumor?
- That's a gallbladder.

226
00:12:06,543 --> 00:12:08,576
- Wait, really?
- Cross my heart, hope to die.

227
00:12:10,246 --> 00:12:13,381
The image is reversed on
an MRI. It's confusing at first.

228
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:19,336
I'm sure Dr. Yang can remember
seeing her first MRI and empathize.

229
00:12:19,438 --> 00:12:21,706
Empathy is a good
quality for a chief resident,

230
00:12:21,808 --> 00:12:24,576
- don't you think, Dr. Bailey?
- Oh, I do, sir.

231
00:12:29,866 --> 00:12:33,134
This is from the feet looking
up, so that's the kidney,

232
00:12:33,236 --> 00:12:36,003
that's the adrenal gland
and that is the tumor.

233
00:12:36,105 --> 00:12:39,457
That's the tumor? It's
eating into the kidney.

234
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:44,495
Right. I was hoping we'd only
have to remove the adrenal gland,

235
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:48,566
but it looks like I'm gonna have
to take Henry's kidney as well.

236
00:12:48,668 --> 00:12:51,364
Dr. Shepherd will decompress
the nerve roots from behind,

237
00:12:51,388 --> 00:12:54,656
and then I will put in a graft
and a plate for stabilization.

238
00:12:54,758 --> 00:12:57,992
But, before any
of that can happen,

239
00:12:58,094 --> 00:13:00,494
we need to move your
neck back into place.

240
00:13:00,597 --> 00:13:02,980
- Fun.
- I'll be done
before you know it.

241
00:13:03,082 --> 00:13:04,910
Sir, you probably don't
want to be here for this.

242
00:13:04,934 --> 00:13:07,718
- No, I'm staying.
- Kyle, don't overdo it. You always...

243
00:13:07,821 --> 00:13:10,515
- There's gonna be a lot of...
- I'm staying. It's my fault he's here.

244
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:15,176
If he's in pain, I'll be here with
him. Stop trying to kick me out.

245
00:13:15,278 --> 00:13:18,379
No, you're right.
You should stay.

246
00:13:18,481 --> 00:13:20,014
Hold his hand.

247
00:13:21,317 --> 00:13:24,151
- OK? OK, Brady.
- Thank you.

248
00:13:24,253 --> 00:13:26,487
- You ready? OK.
- OK.

249
00:13:26,589 --> 00:13:29,841
One, two, three.

250
00:13:29,943 --> 00:13:32,627
Oh, my God!

251
00:13:35,298 --> 00:13:40,952
- How'd my tumor look?
- We don't have the result
from all the scans yet.

252
00:13:41,054 --> 00:13:43,532
I've had 11 operations
in the past three years.

253
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:46,090
I have tumors removed as a
hobby. I know how this works.

254
00:13:46,193 --> 00:13:48,370
You know the results but you
can't tell me. So give me a hint.

255
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:53,781
I mean, look, are we talking
marble? Grapefruit? Basketball?

256
00:13:53,883 --> 00:13:56,912
Dr. Webber will be up shortly
to discuss the results of the scan.

257
00:13:56,936 --> 00:13:59,465
- Come on, Fred, what'd you see?
- Oh, he's
a first-year med student.

258
00:13:59,489 --> 00:14:01,809
- He can't even read a scan.
- Then why does he look like

259
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:05,025
he's gonna piss himself?
Look at his face. He's sweating.

260
00:14:05,127 --> 00:14:08,730
- What's going on? Am I gonna die?
- No, I'm not... My face...

261
00:14:08,831 --> 00:14:11,982
Don't let me... I'm just...
Like she said, pretend I'm...

262
00:14:12,085 --> 00:14:13,367
Stop talking.

263
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:19,040
- What'd you see, Fred?
- Nothing. It's gonna be OK. Truly.

264
00:14:19,142 --> 00:14:21,087
My uncle had his kidney
removed and he's...

265
00:14:21,111 --> 00:14:22,710
- What?
- Oh, God, I'm sorry.

266
00:14:22,812 --> 00:14:26,380
- Stop talking. Mr...
- You have to remove my kidney?

267
00:14:27,767 --> 00:14:30,334
Do you? Do you have
to take out my kidney?

268
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:41,946
The tumor on your adrenal gland
has compromised your kidney.

269
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:44,082
It's enough damage
that we need to remove it.

270
00:14:44,184 --> 00:14:48,769
I know it sounds like a lot,
but it really is our best option.

271
00:14:48,871 --> 00:14:50,849
Could we ask Dr. Altman
what she thinks?

272
00:14:50,873 --> 00:14:54,892
Dr. Altman is a cardiothoracic
surgeon. This isn't her area of expertise.

273
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:57,145
I know, but...

274
00:14:57,246 --> 00:15:00,464
She did this amazing
thing for me. I trust her.

275
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:03,567
I'd feel a whole lot better if I
knew that she was on board.

276
00:15:06,873 --> 00:15:10,357
- I've got a consult waiting.
- We'll be quick. Karev?

277
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:13,461
We put together some stats

278
00:15:13,563 --> 00:15:15,996
comparing the surgical
options for Sarah.

279
00:15:16,098 --> 00:15:19,867
As you can see, this slide
shows the donor site morbidities

280
00:15:19,969 --> 00:15:22,086
associated with using
Sarah's own skull.

281
00:15:22,188 --> 00:15:25,156
- Next slide.
- And here you can
see the pros and cons

282
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:28,509
of using skull bone versus cadaver
bone. You can see that the benefits

283
00:15:28,611 --> 00:15:32,913
- of cadaver bone
are quite extensive...
- Turn the lights on.

284
00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:35,449
- We just got started.
- Lights. Now.

285
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,731
Mark, I know what
the research says.

286
00:15:38,755 --> 00:15:42,456
So there's a chance of some
donor graft complications.

287
00:15:42,558 --> 00:15:45,926
Complications?
No. You, come here.

288
00:15:49,815 --> 00:15:54,518
We do your procedure,
we'd incise here and here.

289
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,148
- What's happening?
- Stand still.

290
00:15:56,172 --> 00:15:58,572
There's risk of hitting
brain, causing a hematoma.

291
00:15:58,674 --> 00:16:01,943
But we take the cadaver
route, you avoid that completely,

292
00:16:02,045 --> 00:16:05,613
which means all of this...

293
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:08,216
- doesn't even get touched.
- She's a child.

294
00:16:08,317 --> 00:16:11,903
And that procedure is experimental.
So as the lead doctor on this case,

295
00:16:12,005 --> 00:16:16,374
let me be clear. We're
doing the surgery as planned.

296
00:16:16,459 --> 00:16:20,911
You're a crappy listener.
Add that to the list.

297
00:16:21,013 --> 00:16:23,292
- What?
- Just saying,
there's more wrong

298
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:25,756
with you than the
fact that you smoke.

299
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:33,707
I probably shouldn't have used
permanent marker. My apologies.

300
00:16:40,433 --> 00:16:41,582
Mrs. Burton?

301
00:16:43,602 --> 00:16:47,738
Mrs. Henry Burton?

302
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:53,244
Your husband requested that I talk
to you about his upcoming operation.

303
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:55,046
We would like to
remove the kidney.

304
00:16:55,148 --> 00:16:59,866
Well, a man can live without a
kidney. If that's your recommendation.

305
00:16:59,969 --> 00:17:03,271
Funny, because that's exactly
what I would recommend,

306
00:17:03,372 --> 00:17:07,741
but, apparently, my
recommendation as chief of surgery

307
00:17:07,843 --> 00:17:12,813
with over 30 years of general surgery
experience under my belt isn't enough.

308
00:17:12,915 --> 00:17:15,282
He would like your
recommendation,

309
00:17:15,384 --> 00:17:20,405
the recommendation of a cardio
surgeon who happens to be his wife.

310
00:17:20,507 --> 00:17:22,690
I see.

311
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:36,287
Yeah, I agree with
your recommendation.

312
00:17:37,106 --> 00:17:38,389
Go...

313
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:45,813
This is a totally inappropriate
relationship! Totally inappropriate!

314
00:17:45,915 --> 00:17:47,709
You want to talk to me about
inappropriate relationships?

315
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:50,545
Everywhere I look in this hospital,
there's inappropriate relationships.

316
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:52,936
Grey and Shepherd.
Hunt and Yang.

317
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:56,273
- The other Grey and Sloan.
- Dr. Bailey's dating a nurse.

318
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:59,343
- Taking full advantage.
- Oh!

319
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:02,763
Ignore him. We are not dating.

320
00:18:08,904 --> 00:18:11,839
- No plus sign yet?
- No. And I'm so tired

321
00:18:11,941 --> 00:18:13,924
of peeing on sticks.
It's exhausting.

322
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:17,506
OK, you think peeing is exhausting?
Wait till you have a mewling,

323
00:18:17,546 --> 00:18:20,792
poo-covered infant hanging
off of your boobs 24/7.

324
00:18:20,816 --> 00:18:23,885
Why is my baby
gonna be poo-covered?

325
00:18:23,987 --> 00:18:25,352
OK, what is that about?

326
00:18:25,454 --> 00:18:29,940
That's right, do another
loop there. Beautiful!

327
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,076
You're a fast learner.

328
00:18:32,178 --> 00:18:34,395
I have a good teacher.

329
00:18:34,497 --> 00:18:36,074
Come on, you
blame him? She's hot.

330
00:18:36,098 --> 00:18:38,498
Don't be a pig.
He's being gross.

331
00:18:38,567 --> 00:18:42,153
- Not to mention unprofessional.
- Well, the thong
is unprofessional.

332
00:18:44,139 --> 00:18:46,257
- Damn it!
- Unprofessional!

333
00:18:46,358 --> 00:18:49,126
What is wrong with them? I was
never that dumb in med school.

334
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:51,178
- They're weak and gutless.
- Boy crazy.

335
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,825
- Oblivious.
- Slutty.

336
00:18:52,849 --> 00:18:55,333
Wow. You all sound really old.

337
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,920
Hey, I know I'm not perfect. I
know sometimes I don't listen.

338
00:19:04,944 --> 00:19:07,990
I'm sorry about that. So
here I am, ready to listen.

339
00:19:08,014 --> 00:19:12,049
- Oh. You're ready to listen.
- Like a priest at confession.

340
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:15,219
You wanna hear what I'm
saying, and really take it in?

341
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:20,057
- And try to give me
what I want?
- Yeah. I really... I really do.

342
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:24,278
Get your crap out
of my apartment.

343
00:19:29,134 --> 00:19:31,602
Let's bandage him up and get
him ready for the next phase.

344
00:19:31,687 --> 00:19:34,448
Kira, do you want to take a
look at these sutures before...?

345
00:19:34,857 --> 00:19:36,417
- Kira?
- Sorry?

346
00:19:36,492 --> 00:19:39,554
- Are you texting?
- Oh, I was just telling
my boyfriend about this.

347
00:19:39,578 --> 00:19:42,396
- Can I send him a picture, do you think?
- - No.

348
00:19:42,498 --> 00:19:46,200
All right, everybody,
take your places.

349
00:19:46,302 --> 00:19:48,814
- Can I help roll him over?
- Edward, move!

350
00:19:48,838 --> 00:19:51,216
OK, we're gonna roll him on
my count. Everybody ready?

351
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,674
One, two, three.

352
00:19:59,648 --> 00:20:01,226
- He's got a junctional rhythm.
- Is there a pulse with that?

353
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:04,068
All right. Pulse is
thready, but it's there.

354
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:05,798
He's hypotensive.
Grey, hang some FFP.

355
00:20:05,822 --> 00:20:08,484
- Let's push one of epi.
- Lost his pulse. Starting compressions.

356
00:20:08,508 --> 00:20:11,342
He could have delayed internal
bleeding. Get ready for a laparotomy.

357
00:20:11,444 --> 00:20:13,044
I need to get in there! Gown me!

358
00:20:13,146 --> 00:20:15,986
- What about
hyperkalemia?
- All right. Out, now!

359
00:20:16,082 --> 00:20:17,692
I saw the monitors when you
turned him. He had peaked T waves,

360
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:19,676
then a widened QRS,
then a sine wave rhythm...

361
00:20:19,702 --> 00:20:21,619
- Dude!
- Push two of calcium,

362
00:20:21,704 --> 00:20:24,905
two D50 and ten units
of regular insulin IV!

363
00:20:39,538 --> 00:20:42,406
Uh, they just taught
us that on Friday, so...

364
00:20:42,492 --> 00:20:44,975
- What's your name?
- Edward, sir.

365
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,094
Good save, Edward.

366
00:20:56,823 --> 00:20:59,590
OK, tell me about your
cadaver bone thing. For Sarah.

367
00:20:59,692 --> 00:21:01,792
Really? Look at you!

368
00:21:01,877 --> 00:21:04,673
Did somebody maybe listen to
what someone else had to say?

369
00:21:04,697 --> 00:21:07,982
OK, I get it, I suck, I'm a
stuck-up self-righteous bitch,

370
00:21:08,084 --> 00:21:09,545
and Callie wants nothing
to do with me ever again.

371
00:21:09,569 --> 00:21:12,436
But can you just drop it and
tell me about the damn surgery?

372
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,540
We'll inject the donor
bones with stem cells.

373
00:21:16,642 --> 00:21:19,510
This way the bones will grow
and conform to Sarah's face.

374
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:22,913
There's a much lower chance
they'll degrade over time.

375
00:21:23,015 --> 00:21:25,044
Which is key, especially
if you want to play sports.

376
00:21:25,068 --> 00:21:28,469
Cool. Random dead
guy's bones in my cheeks?

377
00:21:28,571 --> 00:21:30,649
My teammates will
call me zombie face.

378
00:21:30,673 --> 00:21:33,907
But it's still highly
experimental.

379
00:21:34,009 --> 00:21:36,694
- Jared...
- What about the original plan?

380
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:39,297
This surgery is more advanced

381
00:21:39,399 --> 00:21:41,242
and would decrease the
chance of complications

382
00:21:41,266 --> 00:21:42,827
that could make the
kind of sports Sarah wants

383
00:21:42,851 --> 00:21:44,852
to play out of the question.

384
00:21:44,954 --> 00:21:47,721
It's just sports, honey.
You're good at other things.

385
00:21:47,823 --> 00:21:52,376
- You paint. You draw.
- Because that's all
I've been allowed to do.

386
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:55,507
I'm a tomboy, but I've never
been able to be a tomboy.

387
00:21:55,531 --> 00:21:59,684
I know you want me to
draw and paint and bowl,

388
00:21:59,786 --> 00:22:04,805
but I want to play volleyball
and softball and soccer.

389
00:22:04,907 --> 00:22:07,019
- I don't know.
- - If you guys don't let me

390
00:22:07,043 --> 00:22:09,237
take this chance to
be who I really am,

391
00:22:09,261 --> 00:22:12,363
I'm gonna be more
prone to teen depression,

392
00:22:12,465 --> 00:22:15,332
eating disorders,
drug addiction.

393
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:20,037
- Is that what you want?
- You are too smart
for your own good.

394
00:22:20,823 --> 00:22:23,457
Because all I do is read.

395
00:22:24,693 --> 00:22:29,980
Let me be a dumb jock. Mom, Dad?

396
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,050
Please.

397
00:22:40,709 --> 00:22:44,111
Dividing and ligating
the renal artery and vein.

398
00:22:44,213 --> 00:22:46,513
Beautiful. Nice work, Dr. Yang.

399
00:22:48,851 --> 00:22:53,137
Mr. Wilson? Would you like to
take a look at the tumor up close?

400
00:22:53,239 --> 00:22:56,673
Oh... Sure. I mean, yes.

401
00:22:56,776 --> 00:23:02,512
- Yes.
- OK. So these
are the hilar vessels.

402
00:23:02,615 --> 00:23:05,583
- My med student's gonna faint.
- Catch him, people.

403
00:23:07,053 --> 00:23:09,286
- Thank you.
- Sorry about that, sir.

404
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:12,323
Oh, it's fine. That's
exactly why I like seeing

405
00:23:12,425 --> 00:23:14,508
first-year med students
here once a year.

406
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:18,478
Reminds me where
I started. Humility.

407
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:20,664
That's another good
quality for a chief resident.

408
00:23:20,766 --> 00:23:22,299
Wouldn't you say, Dr. Bailey?

409
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:24,768
It was always one
of my best qualities.

410
00:23:26,055 --> 00:23:28,288
Also, it's funny
when they fall down.

411
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:30,841
Sir, you want to
take a look at this.

412
00:23:41,804 --> 00:23:45,005
He's doing fine. His
spine's been stabilized.

413
00:23:45,107 --> 00:23:48,325
- And he'll be awake soon.
- He's fine? He'll be OK?

414
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:51,728
His recovery will be slow. And
painful. You should be prepared for that.

415
00:23:55,618 --> 00:23:57,978
This was supposed to be
the best day of our lives.

416
00:24:02,057 --> 00:24:05,659
You think I'm silly, I know.

417
00:24:05,761 --> 00:24:10,063
With the horses
and the bagpipes.

418
00:24:12,568 --> 00:24:14,001
So does he.

419
00:24:14,102 --> 00:24:17,470
We don't get marriage
in Washington,

420
00:24:17,572 --> 00:24:20,690
we get domestic partnerships.

421
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:23,352
We get to go to City Hall

422
00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:27,781
and stand in line and
sign some papers.

423
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:31,352
Mail it in, if you're
even more romantic.

424
00:24:32,854 --> 00:24:34,955
So, call me crazy, but...

425
00:24:36,459 --> 00:24:39,993
I just wanted the big day
that everybody else gets.

426
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:45,566
And I fought for it. I
organized rallies. I...

427
00:24:45,668 --> 00:24:48,219
stood in the cold
outside the State House.

428
00:24:48,321 --> 00:24:52,556
I had some Neanderthal throw hot
coffee on me. I fought for a wedding.

429
00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:54,769
And waited.

430
00:24:54,793 --> 00:24:58,161
And they still said, "No."

431
00:24:58,263 --> 00:25:03,550
So when we got tired of waiting, and...
Brady and I went to go sign the papers,

432
00:25:03,652 --> 00:25:05,786
I wanted it to be special.

433
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:13,727
He's the best thing that's
ever happened to me.

434
00:25:13,846 --> 00:25:19,733
And I wanted it to feel like that.
Not like some trip to the DMV.

435
00:25:23,705 --> 00:25:25,723
I wanted it to be special.

436
00:25:29,111 --> 00:25:31,578
Instead, I nearly killed him.

437
00:25:38,054 --> 00:25:40,404
Things don't go the
way you want them to.

438
00:25:41,907 --> 00:25:43,707
Ever.

439
00:25:45,127 --> 00:25:46,860
Ever.

440
00:25:50,449 --> 00:25:53,233
Come on. Let's go see him.

441
00:26:00,158 --> 00:26:01,425
You paged me, chief?

442
00:26:01,527 --> 00:26:03,767
We found a cyst
on Henry's pancreas

443
00:26:03,845 --> 00:26:05,429
that's in danger of rupturing.

444
00:26:05,531 --> 00:26:08,632
Removing it means removing
a large portion of his pancreas

445
00:26:08,717 --> 00:26:11,852
which would make Henry a
diabetic. We didn't discuss

446
00:26:11,954 --> 00:26:15,472
- that possibility with him.
- OK.

447
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:18,542
Do you think that's
something he could live with?

448
00:26:20,129 --> 00:26:22,474
- I don't know.
- - I hate to ask you on the spot,

449
00:26:22,498 --> 00:26:25,616
Dr. Altman, but
technically you are the wife,

450
00:26:25,718 --> 00:26:28,586
and you are also his
emergency contact person.

451
00:26:28,688 --> 00:26:33,924
So I am asking you, do you think he has the
support system to manage a very tricky disease?

452
00:26:38,197 --> 00:26:41,014
- I don't know.
- Is there someone
we could call?

453
00:26:41,116 --> 00:26:43,133
- A next of kin? Anyone?
- I don't know.

454
00:26:43,235 --> 00:26:46,303
You've signed a marriage
license, and you haven't asked him

455
00:26:46,405 --> 00:26:49,590
the most basic questions on
how he wants to live or die?

456
00:26:56,631 --> 00:26:59,516
Do I have your permission
to act as I see fit?

457
00:27:00,502 --> 00:27:02,135
Yes.

458
00:27:05,741 --> 00:27:07,774
That's all, Dr. Altman.

459
00:27:17,269 --> 00:27:19,937
So... did you get my note?

460
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:23,824
- Eli...
- I guess you got my note.

461
00:27:23,926 --> 00:27:25,425
What do you think?

462
00:27:26,629 --> 00:27:29,279
I think you're
dirty, is what I think.

463
00:27:29,381 --> 00:27:30,780
You wanna be dirty with me?

464
00:27:30,883 --> 00:27:33,500
Show me those on-call rooms you
doctors are always having sex in?

465
00:27:33,602 --> 00:27:35,519
I'm going home. Mm!

466
00:27:41,694 --> 00:27:44,444
If you change your
mind, I get off in an hour.

467
00:28:07,786 --> 00:28:09,719
I have a PhD.

468
00:28:11,857 --> 00:28:13,723
Um...

469
00:28:13,825 --> 00:28:16,560
After college, I got a PhD. And
then I went to medical school.

470
00:28:16,662 --> 00:28:19,329
And I'm number one in my class.

471
00:28:19,431 --> 00:28:22,733
I know you think I'm
an idiot, but I'm not.

472
00:28:22,835 --> 00:28:28,272
I've seen this stuff in textbooks,
I've just never seen it up close before.

473
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:37,580
- Whatever. Think
what you want of me.
- You wanna not be an idiot?

474
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:40,478
Back up your resident,
no matter what.

475
00:28:40,502 --> 00:28:42,953
Never undercut them
in front of their boss.

476
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:46,534
When a patient asks you for information
you're not allowed to give them,

477
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:48,591
stall, or say you don't know.

478
00:28:48,693 --> 00:28:50,939
Just wait long enough
until the attending gets there.

479
00:28:50,963 --> 00:28:53,563
The attending takes the lead.

480
00:28:53,665 --> 00:28:56,583
And if you ever panic or
feel faint in an OR again,

481
00:28:56,685 --> 00:29:01,121
just stop thinking, "There's
a body open on a table

482
00:29:01,223 --> 00:29:04,024
in front of you."
Just stop thinking.

483
00:29:04,126 --> 00:29:07,361
And take a deep
breath. It usually helps.

484
00:29:08,948 --> 00:29:10,948
Wow.

485
00:29:11,683 --> 00:29:13,417
Now, I feel like an ass.

486
00:29:14,987 --> 00:29:17,370
Just disregard my evaluation.

487
00:29:19,124 --> 00:29:20,404
What evaluation?

488
00:29:22,661 --> 00:29:25,195
We turned in
evaluations on you guys.

489
00:29:27,666 --> 00:29:29,666
What did you say?

490
00:29:30,069 --> 00:29:31,184
Um...

491
00:29:32,287 --> 00:29:36,106
I might have used the
word, uh, "heartless."

492
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:42,396
Among others, there were...

493
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:54,107
- Thank you, doctor.
- OK. Lay it on me.

494
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:57,344
- Lay what on you?
- The speech.

495
00:29:57,446 --> 00:30:00,063
You know, "The chief
is right, and what you did

496
00:30:00,165 --> 00:30:03,082
- was totally
inappropriate," speech.
- Oh, uh, the speech.

497
00:30:03,184 --> 00:30:06,269
- Yeah.
- Um...

498
00:30:09,074 --> 00:30:12,926
OK, I am not dating a
nurse. We are not dating.

499
00:30:13,028 --> 00:30:16,546
But we are having... fun.

500
00:30:18,049 --> 00:30:22,402
I... I look at him
and he's pretty,

501
00:30:22,504 --> 00:30:25,539
but there's no
future. He's just...

502
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:30,126
I mean, I would not have him to
my house or introduce him to my child

503
00:30:30,229 --> 00:30:32,595
because who knows
what he would do...

504
00:30:32,697 --> 00:30:35,666
He left a dirty note
for me in a chart.

505
00:30:35,768 --> 00:30:40,754
Now, what if the chief opened
the chart and found the...?

506
00:30:40,855 --> 00:30:44,675
It's inappropriate! That's
what he is. He is inappropriate!

507
00:30:46,779 --> 00:30:52,048
But I'm gonna go with it,
because, you know... Why not?

508
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:57,437
That's my attitude these
days, why the hell not?

509
00:31:01,993 --> 00:31:05,796
The cadaver bone doesn't have
any bone-growing cells or proteins in it,

510
00:31:05,898 --> 00:31:09,015
which is why we're
drilling holes in it.

511
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:13,520
- Would you like to hold it?
- - What do you think you're doing?

512
00:31:13,622 --> 00:31:14,804
Teaching.

513
00:31:15,924 --> 00:31:18,136
Dr. Karev, do you really
think it's appropriate

514
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:21,845
for someone with so little experience
to be handling these cadaver bones?

515
00:31:21,947 --> 00:31:24,414
- Relax.
- Karev, Kepner's right.

516
00:31:24,516 --> 00:31:27,917
Your student's allowed
to observe. That's all.

517
00:31:28,019 --> 00:31:30,579
Stubborn. Passive aggressive.

518
00:31:30,622 --> 00:31:34,541
Uh, I resent obligations. Just tell
me when I'm getting warm here.

519
00:31:34,643 --> 00:31:36,688
I choose her over you in the
divorce. You know that, right?

520
00:31:36,712 --> 00:31:39,740
Of course, of course. That's because
you two have been friends forever.

521
00:31:39,764 --> 00:31:44,685
And you and I are like... siblings. We
fight, we get on each other's nerves,

522
00:31:44,787 --> 00:31:47,670
but... point is, you're
like family to me, Mark.

523
00:31:47,772 --> 00:31:49,940
I mean that.

524
00:31:50,976 --> 00:31:53,143
Patronizing. Add
that to the list.

525
00:31:53,245 --> 00:31:56,730
Periosteal elevator,
please. Thank you.

526
00:32:08,794 --> 00:32:10,494
Hi.

527
00:32:14,683 --> 00:32:16,466
Here, have some water.

528
00:32:26,978 --> 00:32:28,678
Just tell me.

529
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:31,347
There was a large
cyst on your pancreas.

530
00:32:31,433 --> 00:32:36,136
When they got in there, it was
necrotic and close to rupturing.

531
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:40,339
They called me
to make a decision.

532
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:42,842
Because you listed me

533
00:32:42,944 --> 00:32:45,612
as your emergency
contact person.

534
00:32:48,133 --> 00:32:49,766
Oh, what did you decide?

535
00:32:49,868 --> 00:32:53,036
They removed a large
portion of your pancreas,

536
00:32:53,138 --> 00:32:57,941
which means that you might
be an insulin-dependent diabetic

537
00:32:58,043 --> 00:33:00,193
for the rest of your life.

538
00:33:00,295 --> 00:33:04,181
It's gonna be a very
big adjustment for you.

539
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:08,251
I'm a man who has a
green thumb for tumors.

540
00:33:08,354 --> 00:33:11,955
I'm familiar with adjustments.

541
00:33:12,057 --> 00:33:17,160
- I really am... I'm sorry.
- You're also angry.

542
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:23,316
That I put you as my
emergency contact.

543
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:29,005
This was supposed
to be about paperwork.

544
00:33:29,107 --> 00:33:34,710
Life and death decisions
wasn't... It wasn't part of our deal.

545
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:38,565
I'm 42-years old.

546
00:33:44,305 --> 00:33:47,807
I lost my... mom and dad

547
00:33:47,909 --> 00:33:52,295
four and... five years
ago, respectively.

548
00:33:52,397 --> 00:33:54,331
My sister lives in Prague,

549
00:33:54,433 --> 00:33:58,435
which is a longer story
than you want to hear.

550
00:33:58,537 --> 00:34:01,070
And when I talk to her, I
tend to err on the side of,

551
00:34:01,172 --> 00:34:03,172
"How are the kids?" and
"Everything here is great."

552
00:34:03,225 --> 00:34:07,260
Because she's broke, and...

553
00:34:07,362 --> 00:34:10,563
because my health thing is...

554
00:34:12,701 --> 00:34:16,052
It's exhausting.

555
00:34:16,154 --> 00:34:19,288
I used to have a best friend, but
he married a woman who made sure

556
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:21,858
that I knew that my health
thing was exhausting.

557
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:24,427
And because I kept maxing
out my insurance policies,

558
00:34:24,529 --> 00:34:27,781
I had to switch jobs about
nine times in the past five years,

559
00:34:27,883 --> 00:34:30,523
so I've always just been the new
guy in the cubicle by the bathroom

560
00:34:30,585 --> 00:34:34,320
who takes a lot...
takes a lot of sick days.

561
00:34:34,422 --> 00:34:37,690
That's not a guy people
make friends with.

562
00:34:37,792 --> 00:34:40,794
It's not my intention to
make you feel sorry for me.

563
00:34:40,896 --> 00:34:43,597
It's my intention
to apologize and...

564
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:49,235
and to explain
that, in this city...

565
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:52,755
you're the closest
thing I have to a friend.

566
00:34:54,876 --> 00:34:58,911
That's why I put you down
as my emergency contact.

567
00:34:59,013 --> 00:35:01,314
Not because of
the fake marriage.

568
00:35:02,951 --> 00:35:05,718
But because I
consider you a friend.

569
00:35:27,008 --> 00:35:28,658
I might be a diabetic?

570
00:35:30,678 --> 00:35:32,511
Yeah.

571
00:35:34,249 --> 00:35:38,284
- That sucks.
- Yeah.

572
00:35:48,446 --> 00:35:50,747
Hey. How you feeling?

573
00:35:52,017 --> 00:35:53,833
Ow.

574
00:35:53,935 --> 00:35:58,939
Brady, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

575
00:35:59,041 --> 00:36:04,360
- I just wanted it to be...
- Special, I know.

576
00:36:05,129 --> 00:36:06,257
You always do.

577
00:36:06,281 --> 00:36:10,183
Shut up, I have to say this

578
00:36:10,285 --> 00:36:13,519
- before I fall asleep again.
- Brady... please.

579
00:36:13,621 --> 00:36:15,688
I forgive you.

580
00:36:16,775 --> 00:36:18,542
Do you hear that?

581
00:36:19,995 --> 00:36:21,545
I forgive you.

582
00:36:22,247 --> 00:36:25,197
So stop apologizing.

583
00:36:26,201 --> 00:36:32,238
And please do not
try to make it up to me.

584
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:34,201
'Cause you'll kill me for sure.

585
00:36:38,964 --> 00:36:40,864
I love you.

586
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:57,380
He's up, if you want to
do a post-op assessment.

587
00:36:57,482 --> 00:36:59,749
- OK, thanks. Good night.
- How long does the post-op

588
00:36:59,851 --> 00:37:02,630
- assessment take?
- Kira, why don't
you just go home.

589
00:37:02,654 --> 00:37:05,166
- No, it's cool.
- You're obviously
not interested

590
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:07,270
- in learning anything.
- I am. I totally am.

591
00:37:07,325 --> 00:37:09,965
- Today was really interesting.
- Really? Because
you had the chance

592
00:37:10,028 --> 00:37:12,273
to observe a very rare surgery
today, and you looked at your phone

593
00:37:12,297 --> 00:37:14,976
the whole entire time. You had the
opportunity to ask me any question

594
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,228
you wanted, and instead you
asked me about my husband.

595
00:37:17,252 --> 00:37:19,302
You've been sneaking
off to the bathroom all day,

596
00:37:19,404 --> 00:37:21,755
and I saw the pregnancy
tests in your locker.

597
00:37:21,857 --> 00:37:24,523
So me asking about your husband?

598
00:37:24,625 --> 00:37:27,143
I was just trying to
get on your good side.

599
00:37:28,813 --> 00:37:30,447
Whatever.

600
00:37:32,284 --> 00:37:34,584
You're kidding. They
were evaluating us?

601
00:37:34,686 --> 00:37:36,797
Don't worry, no one will read
them. They'll just get filed away

602
00:37:36,821 --> 00:37:39,389
in a room next to the morgue.

603
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:47,646
"Dr. Yang lacked patience
and basic compassion.

604
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:53,669
Dr. Kepner,
unwilling to delegate.

605
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:59,291
Dr. Avery placed his own learning
opportunities before my own.

606
00:37:59,393 --> 00:38:03,846
And Dr. Grey seemed to have
a lot going on personally today."

607
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:10,502
The only one of you who seemed to
actually teach today was Dr. Karev.

608
00:38:10,605 --> 00:38:14,624
The rest of you
failed. Big time.

609
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:20,380
I hate that guy.

610
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:37,630
I don't know. OK?

611
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:40,950
I don't know what my worst faults
are. I try not to think about them.

612
00:38:41,052 --> 00:38:43,336
I'm not proud of
that. So just tell me.

613
00:38:43,438 --> 00:38:46,556
What the hell do I have to cop to, to
make her give me another chance?

614
00:38:48,142 --> 00:38:49,709
You bail.

615
00:38:50,511 --> 00:38:51,795
When things get hard,

616
00:38:51,897 --> 00:38:55,048
you bail.

617
00:39:01,139 --> 00:39:04,457
"Unwilling to delegate?"
I am a great delegator.

618
00:39:04,575 --> 00:39:06,703
It's key to why
I'm so organized.

619
00:39:06,727 --> 00:39:11,647
Oh, hi. Uh, just wanted
to get some water.

620
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:14,733
Well, the glasses
are in that cabinet.

621
00:39:22,377 --> 00:39:24,010
Ow!

622
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,126
Hey.

623
00:39:42,263 --> 00:39:45,031
So, how'd you do today?

624
00:39:45,133 --> 00:39:48,735
Med student screwed me.

625
00:39:48,837 --> 00:39:50,603
I did pretty good.

626
00:39:50,705 --> 00:39:53,239
- Want some dinner?
- Mm-hm.

627
00:39:59,547 --> 00:40:02,248
So I peed on ten sticks today.

628
00:40:02,350 --> 00:40:04,112
- Ten?
- And I stole
them from the clinic

629
00:40:04,136 --> 00:40:06,097
because they're
$15 at the store.

630
00:40:06,121 --> 00:40:07,832
So you're a thief, is that
what you're telling me?

631
00:40:07,856 --> 00:40:09,238
A barren thief.

632
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:15,627
Look, it takes time
getting pregnant.

633
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:18,775
Not for some people. Some
people hit it on the first try.

634
00:40:18,799 --> 00:40:22,001
- Those people
are overachievers.
- I am an overachiever.

635
00:40:22,103 --> 00:40:24,615
That's the whole thing. I spent
my whole day peeing on sticks

636
00:40:24,639 --> 00:40:27,924
and not teaching my med student so
I'm getting my ass kicked in this race

637
00:40:28,026 --> 00:40:31,210
for chief resident, so I'm
not overachieving at anything.

638
00:40:31,312 --> 00:40:35,815
I used to be hardcore.
Now, I'm softcore.

639
00:40:35,917 --> 00:40:39,819
Did we just start
talking about porn?

640
00:40:39,921 --> 00:40:41,582
- Stop it, I'm upset.
- You're just upset

641
00:40:41,606 --> 00:40:45,791
because we haven't made a baby.
And I say practice makes perfect.

642
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:01,724
I bail. OK? When things
get hard, I walk away.

643
00:41:01,827 --> 00:41:03,805
And maybe it's because
I grew up an Army brat,

644
00:41:03,829 --> 00:41:07,513
and we moved every 18 months.
Maybe I never learned to commit.

645
00:41:07,615 --> 00:41:09,782
But I'm here now.

646
00:41:09,885 --> 00:41:12,263
And I'm staying because I'm gonna
fight to make sure that you know

647
00:41:12,287 --> 00:41:17,690
that I'm committed to this thing.
I'm not perfect, but neither are you.

648
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:22,545
And you want to talk about faults?
How about not being able to forgive?

649
00:41:24,516 --> 00:41:27,583
At some point, you're
gonna have to forgive me.

650
00:41:27,685 --> 00:41:31,804
And it may as well be now
because I'm in love with you, Calliope,

651
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:36,809
and you are in love with me and
all I'm asking for is one more chance.

652
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:39,712
<i>It's all anybody wants, right?</i>

653
00:41:39,814 --> 00:41:42,081
<i>Clean slate? A new beginning?</i>

654
00:41:42,183 --> 00:41:47,270
- You want another chance?
- Yes. More than anything. I want another chance.

655
00:41:47,372 --> 00:41:49,066
<i>Like that's gonna be any easier.</i>

656
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:52,408
<i>Ask the guy pushing
the boulder up the hill.</i>

657
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:54,877
<i>Nothing's easy
about starting over.</i>

658
00:41:54,979 --> 00:41:57,413
Today, I found out
that I'm pregnant.

659
00:41:58,249 --> 00:42:00,416
With Mark's baby.

660
00:42:05,373 --> 00:42:07,406
How about now?

661
00:42:09,477 --> 00:42:11,744
<i>Nothing at all.</i>
