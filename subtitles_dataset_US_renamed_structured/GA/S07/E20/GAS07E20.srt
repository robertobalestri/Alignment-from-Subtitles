1
00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:04,970
I just wanna say, I'm really
excited about the clinical trial.

2
00:00:05,072 --> 00:00:08,073
I've been reading in<i> The New
England Journal of Medicine...</i>

3
00:00:08,175 --> 00:00:12,577
<i>Germs. Disease. Toxins.</i>

4
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:19,284
<i>Our bodies encounter dangers all
the time, just beneath the surface.</i>

5
00:00:21,755 --> 00:00:23,455
<i>Hidden.</i>

6
00:00:25,159 --> 00:00:30,646
<i>Whether you realize it or not, your
body is constantly protecting itself.</i>

7
00:00:35,853 --> 00:00:38,987
- I'd like to propose a toast...
- - Why is the sperm donor here?

8
00:00:39,089 --> 00:00:42,207
- I thought tonight
was a family dinner.
- Dad.

9
00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:44,909
To two extraordinary
women. May your lives

10
00:00:45,011 --> 00:00:47,645
be overfilled with
love, happiness and joy.

11
00:00:47,747 --> 00:00:49,764
To Callie and Arizona,

12
00:00:49,867 --> 00:00:53,869
- the mothers of my child.
- Oh, for God's sake.

13
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:57,155
Oh, Daniel. Cheers.

14
00:00:57,257 --> 00:00:59,958
- Cheers!
- Yes! There we go.

15
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:04,479
Do you ever go by anything
other than "Colonel," Colonel?

16
00:01:04,581 --> 00:01:08,567
- The Colonel.
- Actually, um,
we forgot to say grace.

17
00:01:08,669 --> 00:01:11,419
- Say what?
- We should say grace
before we eat.

18
00:01:11,521 --> 00:01:15,257
Of course. Shame on us.
Fork down, The Colonel.

19
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:18,426
- Mom, you wanna lead?
- Bless us, oh Lord,
and these...

20
00:01:18,528 --> 00:01:20,006
<i>Every time you blink your eye,</i>

21
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:22,764
<i>you wash away thousands
of unwanted microbes.</i>

22
00:01:22,866 --> 00:01:25,266
<i>Breathe in too much unwanted
pollen, and you sneeze.</i>

23
00:01:25,368 --> 00:01:26,888
- Amen.
- Amen.

24
00:01:28,905 --> 00:01:31,590
OK, I'll go get her. Excuse me.

25
00:01:31,691 --> 00:01:36,277
Arizona, we sat next to a charming
young man on the plane today,

26
00:01:36,379 --> 00:01:39,814
and he said he was going with
his partner to march in a parade.

27
00:01:39,916 --> 00:01:44,603
- For Pride.
- Yeah. Those are good.

28
00:01:44,705 --> 00:01:47,467
<i>The body knows when it's encountered
something that doesn't belong.</i>

29
00:01:47,491 --> 00:01:52,210
Oh! She couldn't
be cuter if she tried.

30
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:53,973
Mom, you haven't had
a chance to hold her yet.

31
00:01:53,997 --> 00:01:55,641
<i>The body detects the invader,</i>

32
00:01:55,665 --> 00:01:57,143
<i>it releases its
white blood cells...</i>

33
00:01:57,167 --> 00:01:58,433
No, no. That's all right.

34
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:01,269
Thank you, though, I'm eating.

35
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:05,207
<i>And it attacks.</i>

36
00:02:07,128 --> 00:02:10,462
This is Zola. She's six months
old, born with spina bifida.

37
00:02:10,564 --> 00:02:13,849
Adorable African children.
Shameless ego stroking.

38
00:02:13,951 --> 00:02:16,301
- Karev is a genius.
- He's single-handedly stealing

39
00:02:16,403 --> 00:02:18,849
chief resident out from under all
of us. And we're helping him do it.

40
00:02:18,873 --> 00:02:21,507
We can't exactly refuse
to treat little sick kids

41
00:02:21,609 --> 00:02:25,577
- without making
ourselves look bad.
- He is a genius. Or...

42
00:02:28,131 --> 00:02:30,665
That's what they say in Swahili.

43
00:02:30,767 --> 00:02:33,034
Well, he only has a shot
because I've been benched.

44
00:02:33,136 --> 00:02:35,670
The playing field has been
leveled. You're all welcome.

45
00:02:35,772 --> 00:02:38,574
My Alzheimer's trial
kicks African orphan ass.

46
00:02:38,676 --> 00:02:41,660
- It kicks all of your asses.
- You wanna keep
it down back there?

47
00:02:41,762 --> 00:02:44,491
I'm trying to listen to what appears
to be the next chief resident talking.

48
00:02:44,515 --> 00:02:48,183
Before we go, I wanna say thank
you to all of you for your participation.

49
00:02:48,285 --> 00:02:50,819
It truly means
more than I can say.

50
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:55,774
Slow clap. They're giving
him the slow clap? Come on.

51
00:02:55,876 --> 00:02:58,359
I'm not giving
him the slow clap.

52
00:03:00,146 --> 00:03:03,631
OK, I want to personally
check the incision sites,

53
00:03:03,733 --> 00:03:07,419
any weight fluctuations,
the patients' glucose levels.

54
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:10,054
When was the last time you
cleaned these cages, Avery?

55
00:03:10,156 --> 00:03:13,791
A clean cage means a lower infection
rate which means FDA approval.

56
00:03:13,893 --> 00:03:16,794
- Understood?
- Cages. I got it, sir.

57
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:22,967
Makena? Hi, I'm Dr. Shepherd.
Of course, you know Dr. Karev.

58
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:25,453
We're here to take
a look at Zola today.

59
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:31,543
Sometimes babies with spina bifida
can develop Chiari malformation.

60
00:03:31,645 --> 00:03:34,057
It causes fluid build-up in the
brain. It can be pretty uncomfortable,

61
00:03:34,081 --> 00:03:36,948
but sometimes, if you adjust
the patient's head position...

62
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,984
It helps relieve the pressure.

63
00:03:40,086 --> 00:03:41,920
Let me see this.
Let me see this face.

64
00:03:42,022 --> 00:03:44,956
We've had her at the orphanage
since she was two months old.

65
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,820
This is the first time she's stopped
crying since I can remember.

66
00:03:47,844 --> 00:03:50,412
Let's just run an MRI
and check to see if she has

67
00:03:50,514 --> 00:03:53,376
a Chiari malformation and hydrocephalus.
If it's positive, we're gonna have to do

68
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,735
a shunt to drain the fluid. It's
gonna postpone the spinal surgery,

69
00:03:56,836 --> 00:03:59,065
- but I think
it's gonna be worth it.
- I think she likes you.

70
00:03:59,089 --> 00:04:02,741
She can keep
that. I have plenty.

71
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:12,050
Sefu, I will be repairing your brother's
heart defect tomorrow while Dr. Sloan,

72
00:04:12,152 --> 00:04:15,381
our head of plastics, he will
construct Kondo a new sternum.

73
00:04:24,164 --> 00:04:28,249
He wants to know, if he dies, could
we wait to tell the family at home?

74
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:31,953
Our sister's birthday is tomorrow.
He doesn't want to ruin it.

75
00:04:35,526 --> 00:04:39,561
We are gonna take really
good care of you. OK?

76
00:04:39,663 --> 00:04:42,531
And you are not gonna
ruin your sister's birthday.

77
00:04:42,632 --> 00:04:46,584
We have to look
at his chest, OK?

78
00:04:57,931 --> 00:04:59,164
Wow.

79
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:03,144
- Sir...
- Get off me!

80
00:05:03,186 --> 00:05:05,353
- I told you that I'm fine!
- Sir, please.

81
00:05:05,455 --> 00:05:07,639
- I don't need any of your help!
- Sir, if you continue

82
00:05:07,741 --> 00:05:10,726
to try to get out of bed, I'm
gonna have to restrain you.

83
00:05:10,828 --> 00:05:15,530
- Ah!
- B52 cocktail. Ought to calm him down.

84
00:05:15,632 --> 00:05:19,234
OK, listen. I need to get back
in the race for chief resident.

85
00:05:19,335 --> 00:05:21,837
I need in on Teddy's
pentalogy of Cantrell patient.

86
00:05:21,939 --> 00:05:25,623
This isn't funny anymore. She is still
shutting me out. Can't you talk to her?

87
00:05:25,726 --> 00:05:28,237
I thought you were on Robbins'
service today. Isn't she on that case, too?

88
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:31,963
Yeah, but that just puts me like
inches away from some other resident

89
00:05:32,066 --> 00:05:34,733
doing the most amazing
cardio procedure imaginable,

90
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:37,869
while I just stand
there and... suction.

91
00:05:37,971 --> 00:05:41,506
- It's torture.
- You need to apologize.

92
00:05:42,526 --> 00:05:44,726
Apologize for what?

93
00:05:44,828 --> 00:05:47,862
For having better judgment than
Teddy? For saving Callie's life?

94
00:05:47,964 --> 00:05:49,526
There is a wedding
tomorrow because of me.

95
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:52,167
Your apology could
use some work.

96
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:55,637
You asked me how to get back
in with Teddy. I'm telling you how.

97
00:05:57,074 --> 00:05:59,507
Asha is ten years old, she
sustained internal injuries

98
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:03,211
six years ago from an explosive
device. She has multiple enterotomies.

99
00:06:03,313 --> 00:06:05,880
There are some strictures
there and some ascites.

100
00:06:05,982 --> 00:06:09,250
She has not healed properly.
This complicates things.

101
00:06:09,352 --> 00:06:12,954
As does the fact that
she's HIV positive.

102
00:06:13,056 --> 00:06:15,156
She's living with AIDS.

103
00:06:15,258 --> 00:06:16,825
Hello.

104
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:22,663
April. Don't be scared.

105
00:06:26,069 --> 00:06:28,703
I'm just gonna take your
blood pressure now, OK?

106
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:32,240
Oh, no, it's OK, it's OK.
Um, we're here to help.

107
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:37,361
- Help.
- Let's get her
on LR at maintenance

108
00:06:37,464 --> 00:06:40,799
- and start broad
spectrum antibiotics.
- Understand?

109
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:46,154
- Help. Help.
- Dr. Kepner? Um...

110
00:06:46,256 --> 00:06:48,540
The antibiotics and the LR.

111
00:06:48,642 --> 00:06:49,936
Oh, right, sorry,
Dr. Hunt. Right away.

112
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,205
Dr. Kepner, perhaps
if you spent a little

113
00:06:52,229 --> 00:06:54,629
more time just doing your job

114
00:06:54,731 --> 00:06:56,609
and a little less time
learning the new languages,

115
00:06:56,633 --> 00:06:59,534
your attendings wouldn't
have to repeat themselves.

116
00:07:02,656 --> 00:07:03,955
Hold, please.

117
00:07:15,636 --> 00:07:18,469
Dr. Altman, I would
like to apologize.

118
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:22,306
I am... sorry...

119
00:07:22,408 --> 00:07:25,510
for going over your head
and putting you in a difficult

120
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:30,915
position during Callie's
surgery. I am sorry. I apologize.

121
00:07:32,568 --> 00:07:35,703
Are you saying this
because you mean it,

122
00:07:35,805 --> 00:07:38,740
or because you want
back on my service?

123
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:42,227
Does it really matter?

124
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:45,463
Yes. It matters.

125
00:07:55,709 --> 00:07:57,709
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

126
00:07:57,811 --> 00:08:02,847
I, uh, put together a schedule
to help with the next two days.

127
00:08:04,084 --> 00:08:07,185
By the hour, military time.
Wow. Thank you, Colonel.

128
00:08:07,287 --> 00:08:10,421
And I picked up a little
something for Sofia.

129
00:08:10,524 --> 00:08:13,391
- Look at the little rosebuds!
- OK, Mom, baby clothes later.

130
00:08:13,476 --> 00:08:15,305
Wedding rehearsal
now. I've got 20 minutes

131
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:17,273
before I have to get
back to the hospital.

132
00:08:17,297 --> 00:08:20,431
- Dad, where's
the moment of silence?
- Time is tight, Arizona.

133
00:08:20,534 --> 00:08:22,734
I could not find a place
in the ceremony for it.

134
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:25,320
We have to light a candle
for Timothy. It's two minutes.

135
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:28,356
- Timothy? Oh.
- Her brother.

136
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:30,575
- Dad?
- Sweetie, don't push it.

137
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:32,977
OK, so the table is the altar,

138
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:37,749
and the lamp is...?

139
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:39,900
- Father Brooks.
- Your priest?

140
00:08:40,003 --> 00:08:44,155
Ahem. Minister. No, he's not Catholic,
but he practices at a very big church.

141
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:47,926
It's old and drafty. It's...
You'll like it. It's very churchy.

142
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:50,845
- I see.
- OK, Mrs. Torres,
you'll be over here

143
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:54,148
- in the front row.
- OK. And I know
where you want me.

144
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:57,435
Right back here to walk
my little girl down the aisle.

145
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:02,640
Sorry, sorry. Surgery ran
long, but I'm here. I made it.

146
00:09:02,743 --> 00:09:05,376
- Where do you want me?
- That is not where you will be.

147
00:09:05,478 --> 00:09:09,147
Is this your spot? Sorry.

148
00:09:09,249 --> 00:09:13,217
Hey, Mark, why don't you
stand over here next to me?

149
00:09:21,411 --> 00:09:24,178
At least one of my
fathers-in-law doesn't hate me.

150
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:28,583
You're Sofia's father. I love Sofia,
so I'm gonna at least try to like you.

151
00:09:28,685 --> 00:09:31,948
But if you call me your
father-in-law again, I'll knock you out.

152
00:09:31,972 --> 00:09:37,175
OK. So Arizona walks
down the aisle first...

153
00:09:38,312 --> 00:09:40,245
There she goes.

154
00:09:42,182 --> 00:09:46,117
All right, and then I go...

155
00:09:46,219 --> 00:09:48,836
And then I hand
the bouquet to...

156
00:09:48,938 --> 00:09:52,207
Mom, can I hand you the bouquet?

157
00:09:52,309 --> 00:09:57,228
Actually, I... I need to use
the powder room. Excuse me.

158
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:02,417
Well, I'd like some bouquet
time, if you don't mind.

159
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:04,452
I haven't had enough
bouquet time today.

160
00:10:04,554 --> 00:10:08,155
I mean, you'd think being on the
chief's research project would help

161
00:10:08,258 --> 00:10:11,593
in the race for chief resident. You
might even think it'd make me a contender.

162
00:10:11,695 --> 00:10:14,762
Only, I'm not saving little
kids or people with Alzheimer's.

163
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:17,332
- I am cleaning up mouse poop.
- Can you hand me that basin?

164
00:10:17,434 --> 00:10:19,645
Wanna hear my conversation
with the chief every morning?

165
00:10:19,669 --> 00:10:21,969
"Avery, how are the
mice?" "They're fine, chief.

166
00:10:22,071 --> 00:10:23,749
They're running on their wheels,
they're eating their cheese."

167
00:10:23,773 --> 00:10:26,268
If I worked at a pet store, I'd be
employee of the month by now,

168
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:28,759
but I'm a surgeon,
babysitting a bunch of mice.

169
00:10:28,862 --> 00:10:32,580
Until you get FDA approval. I'm sure
you're gonna be working on humans

170
00:10:32,682 --> 00:10:35,867
any day now. Now
grab me another plum.

171
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:39,186
Why are you peeling
these things apart, anyway?

172
00:10:39,289 --> 00:10:40,821
I'm practicing.

173
00:10:40,923 --> 00:10:44,859
Since my kid's skin has grown
directly onto the heart muscle,

174
00:10:44,961 --> 00:10:49,013
I'm gonna be helping Teddy remove the
adhesions without puncturing the heart.

175
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:54,903
Hey, don't eat my adhesions!

176
00:10:55,005 --> 00:10:56,788
Oh, gross!

177
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:59,590
OK, OK, look. I
need 20 good reasons

178
00:10:59,693 --> 00:11:02,004
why I shouldn't let Cristina
back on my service today,

179
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:05,340
because I am ready to buckle.
I've got a really complicated case,

180
00:11:05,364 --> 00:11:08,733
and I could use her skills today,
so 20 reasons. Right now. Please.

181
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:12,036
I don't have one reason. I think you
should put her back on your service.

182
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:15,139
No! That would be the
worst thing that I could do.

183
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:18,076
I mean, that won't
teach her a thing.

184
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:21,412
She went over your head in a
surgery. Yes, that was bad form,

185
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,292
but don't you think you're
being a little bit harsh?

186
00:11:23,316 --> 00:11:26,751
Harsh? OK, first of all, she
went over my head to you.

187
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:29,699
And you enabled that behavior,
which you really shouldn't have done.

188
00:11:29,723 --> 00:11:32,656
But more importantly is
Cristina is dangerous right now.

189
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:34,809
She got lucky. Callie
survived that procedure,

190
00:11:34,911 --> 00:11:37,945
but it just as easily could
have been disastrous.

191
00:11:38,047 --> 00:11:42,116
Cristina got lucky. She doesn't
see it that way. She thinks she's right.

192
00:11:42,218 --> 00:11:45,986
She always thinks she's right,
and that is not being a good doctor.

193
00:11:46,088 --> 00:11:48,088
- That is dangerous.
- Tell her that.

194
00:11:48,191 --> 00:11:50,591
Instead of just shutting
her out, tell her that.

195
00:11:50,693 --> 00:11:53,772
There's no telling Cristina Yang
anything. She has to learn it.

196
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:56,930
And, until then, I am
OK being the bad guy.

197
00:11:57,033 --> 00:12:00,518
I can handle her being angry
at me. But do you really think

198
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:03,170
that she can handle something
like killing Callie Torres?

199
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:10,328
So, Zola doesn't have a Chiari malformation,
but she does have hydrocephalus.

200
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:12,608
OK. Let's book an
OR for the shunt.

201
00:12:12,632 --> 00:12:14,359
Hey, what you got
for me? Any news?

202
00:12:14,383 --> 00:12:16,546
Oh! I went over all
the screening tests,

203
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:19,164
but you need to start looking at
the next wave of patient charts.

204
00:12:19,188 --> 00:12:20,533
- Next wave?
- For the Alzheimer's trial.

205
00:12:20,557 --> 00:12:22,134
The first wave of
the trial is done,

206
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:23,435
now we're getting ready
to treat the next group.

207
00:12:23,459 --> 00:12:27,128
Let me know when
the OR is booked.

208
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:29,981
Mer, what's going on?
Does he know what you did?

209
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,566
What did I do?

210
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:33,601
I saw you with the
clinical trial envelope.

211
00:12:33,703 --> 00:12:36,582
You were hiding it under your lab coat.
If you messed with this trial somehow,

212
00:12:36,606 --> 00:12:38,286
this could be bad for
you, like really bad.

213
00:12:38,358 --> 00:12:40,336
I don't know what
you're talking about.

214
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,511
Whatever you did, no matter how
minor, it invalidates the entire project.

215
00:12:43,613 --> 00:12:46,130
- Alex.
- You could get
into real trouble, Mer.

216
00:12:46,232 --> 00:12:48,299
It's illegal to mess
around with a blind trial.

217
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:52,437
I didn't do anything!
So shut up about it!

218
00:12:55,008 --> 00:12:58,476
- Dr. Stark, can I talk to you?
- Well, it appears
you already are.

219
00:12:58,578 --> 00:13:01,262
I have some concerns, about
Asha. She hasn't eaten a bite

220
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:04,365
- of food since she arrived.
- Start her on
parenteral nutrition.

221
00:13:04,467 --> 00:13:08,569
I will, obviously. But more to the
point, the fact that she's not eating,

222
00:13:08,671 --> 00:13:11,171
not speaking, she just
seems really scared...

223
00:13:11,274 --> 00:13:14,742
You know, unless the next piece
of information from your mouth

224
00:13:14,844 --> 00:13:20,147
relies on the words "lab results" or
"vitals" or "code blue," I don't care.

225
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:23,284
You promised!

226
00:13:25,788 --> 00:13:30,324
You promised me that we could
work together, that it wouldn't be weird,

227
00:13:30,426 --> 00:13:32,946
that you would treat me
like any other resident.

228
00:13:35,966 --> 00:13:40,651
I assure you, I am treating you
exactly the way I treat other residents.

229
00:13:43,522 --> 00:13:45,823
It's a 911 on Asha.

230
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:48,092
Asha, what's wrong?

231
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:51,273
- OK, what happened?
- Her blood pressure dropped
out, her pulse was thready.

232
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:52,380
Did somebody notify Hunt?

233
00:13:54,684 --> 00:13:56,417
Help.

234
00:13:56,519 --> 00:13:59,737
OK, get me four units of
packed cells, draw a new CBC,

235
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,139
coags, open up her
fluids. Kepner, get a gown.

236
00:14:02,242 --> 00:14:04,158
I'm fine. I need a
central line kit right now.

237
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,928
- Kepner!
- I'm fine. I've got this.

238
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:14,085
- Two more days.
- Hm.

239
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:15,619
We can handle two more days.

240
00:14:15,721 --> 00:14:19,101
And then they'll be gone and
our lives will go back to normal.

241
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:22,893
No more brunches,
no more praying.

242
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:27,749
No more my dad calling
himself The Colonel.

243
00:14:27,851 --> 00:14:31,202
We just need to focus
on the big picture.

244
00:14:31,304 --> 00:14:32,836
- Yeah.
- Which is...

245
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:39,176
you and I are getting married.

246
00:14:44,066 --> 00:14:46,834
- We're getting married.
- We're getting married.

247
00:14:48,337 --> 00:14:51,506
We couldn't stop the bleeding
so we rushed her here.

248
00:14:51,608 --> 00:14:54,308
- Oh. What the hell?
- It looks like wax.

249
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:56,188
I have never seen
anything like this.

250
00:14:56,212 --> 00:15:00,114
Nobody has, at least not in the
States. She has intestinal TB. Poor kid.

251
00:15:00,216 --> 00:15:03,151
Adhesions everywhere. It's
hard to even know where to begin.

252
00:15:03,252 --> 00:15:05,263
The perforation is pretty
high at the lesser curvature.

253
00:15:05,287 --> 00:15:08,973
We should treat it like a normal perf,
right? Then start the anti-TB meds?

254
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:11,971
The less aggressive we are, the greater
chance we can avoid short gut syndrome.

255
00:15:11,995 --> 00:15:16,764
Absolutely right, Kepner. Let's
start by ligating the bleeding vessel.

256
00:15:16,866 --> 00:15:20,951
The trick is to go in very
slowly until you feel a little give,

257
00:15:21,053 --> 00:15:23,733
- and then you should see some fluid.
- - Got it.

258
00:15:23,773 --> 00:15:26,213
Very nice. You know, I wasn't
exactly pleased when you decided

259
00:15:26,308 --> 00:15:28,108
- to bow out of the trial.
- Yeah, well...

260
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:29,922
But the work you're doing
with the kids, really impressive.

261
00:15:29,946 --> 00:15:32,357
- Thank you.
- And you were
right about Meredith

262
00:15:32,381 --> 00:15:34,882
being the right person for
the Alzheimer's trial all along.

263
00:15:36,336 --> 00:15:38,314
I'm impressed. You
are remarkably calm

264
00:15:38,338 --> 00:15:40,082
for a bride who's
getting married tomorrow.

265
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:42,186
You should see the schedule
that my dad put together.

266
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:45,276
I just show up where I belong
when I belong, it's perfect.

267
00:15:45,378 --> 00:15:46,858
Everyone should
get married like this.

268
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,982
Who's that from? Hottie
Husband or Hottie Boyfriend?

269
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:56,887
It's from Andrew, who is not my
boyfriend. He's just my wedding date.

270
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:59,774
Uh-huh. And does your Hottie Wedding
Date know about Hottie Husband?

271
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:02,287
Well, there's nothing to know.
I mean, Andrew will be in town

272
00:16:02,311 --> 00:16:04,573
for another week, and then
he's off to who knows where.

273
00:16:04,597 --> 00:16:07,977
So I am just enjoying what he
has to offer while he's offering.

274
00:16:08,001 --> 00:16:11,419
Appropriate urinary output.
Normal weight reading.

275
00:16:11,521 --> 00:16:16,057
And... running on the wheel.
Patient H, you're looking great.

276
00:16:17,526 --> 00:16:19,693
Very good.

277
00:16:19,796 --> 00:16:23,714
Patient I, what can I say?
Appropriate urinary output.

278
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:27,151
I cannot believe I am talking
to mice like they are... Oh, no.

279
00:16:27,253 --> 00:16:30,120
No, no, no. Mouse J? Mouse J!

280
00:16:32,525 --> 00:16:37,678
OK, so just pretend my
hoodie's a gown. OK?

281
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:42,884
And... open your eyes.

282
00:16:42,986 --> 00:16:47,288
What do you think? I had
it made to look like yours.

283
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:49,023
I... I can see that.

284
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:51,692
I have loved this picture
since I was a little girl

285
00:16:51,795 --> 00:16:54,962
and I just wanted
to surprise you. I...

286
00:16:55,064 --> 00:16:56,664
Do you like it?

287
00:17:01,237 --> 00:17:03,537
OK, what, Mom?

288
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:08,692
- What don't you like?
- Nothing. It's...

289
00:17:09,562 --> 00:17:11,328
It's lovely.

290
00:17:12,465 --> 00:17:14,231
Lovely?

291
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:18,436
- That's... it?
- What else would
you like me to say?

292
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:21,572
Oh, I don't know, something.
I've been bending over backwards

293
00:17:21,674 --> 00:17:23,994
since you first got here just
to make you feel comfortable.

294
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:26,310
I didn't ask you to
do anything for me.

295
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:28,279
I'm getting married
in a church for you!

296
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:33,201
Don't you dare imply there's anything
about a wedding to a woman or...

297
00:17:34,537 --> 00:17:36,871
a baby out of
wedlock that's for me.

298
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:44,712
Wow... OK.

299
00:17:46,382 --> 00:17:51,719
So, what bothers you more? My
bastard child or my lesbian fiancee?

300
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:55,139
You're a lawyer, Mom. You're out in
the world, you know other gay people.

301
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:56,607
Your secretary is gay.

302
00:18:02,148 --> 00:18:05,332
I'm your daughter.

303
00:18:05,434 --> 00:18:08,936
Do you know how
devastating it is

304
00:18:09,038 --> 00:18:13,206
to raise a child
and to love a child

305
00:18:13,308 --> 00:18:16,410
and know you won't
see that child in heaven?

306
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:19,514
Mom.

307
00:18:19,616 --> 00:18:20,896
You are not a bride.

308
00:18:21,901 --> 00:18:25,186
And I am not the
mother of a bride.

309
00:18:25,288 --> 00:18:28,089
And this...

310
00:18:28,191 --> 00:18:31,942
This isn't your wedding.

311
00:18:33,629 --> 00:18:39,366
It isn't right. I'm sorry,
but I can't be here.

312
00:18:40,336 --> 00:18:41,919
I just can't.

313
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:53,597
Sefu.

314
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:57,201
Didn't they get you a cot so you
could stay with your brother tonight?

315
00:18:57,303 --> 00:18:59,603
I can't sleep.

316
00:19:09,415 --> 00:19:13,651
Back home, I have
all these sisters.

317
00:19:13,753 --> 00:19:18,072
But Kondo, he's my only brother.

318
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:21,292
And...

319
00:19:22,562 --> 00:19:24,961
I don't want to lose him.

320
00:19:26,031 --> 00:19:29,933
I know you don't. I know.

321
00:19:40,446 --> 00:19:43,947
You have apparently stopped
answering your pages in order to what?

322
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:47,551
Join the kitchen staff? I
need those post-op reports.

323
00:19:47,653 --> 00:19:49,631
Wet-to-dry dressing
applied in 1810,

324
00:19:49,655 --> 00:19:51,466
vitals stable on your
Crohn's patient post-op.

325
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:54,791
You were exposed to HIV positive
blood. You've checked yourself for cuts.

326
00:19:54,893 --> 00:20:00,464
I'm a doctor. We get exposed to things
all the time. I know proper protocol.

327
00:20:00,567 --> 00:20:03,200
And this sticky yellow
mess here? This took priority

328
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:04,680
over reporting back
to me because...?

329
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:08,105
This sticky yellow
mess is nsima.

330
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:11,075
It's a maize porridge which
happens to be a staple

331
00:20:11,177 --> 00:20:13,544
in most East African countries.
I found the recipe online.

332
00:20:13,646 --> 00:20:16,113
I'm not sure why Asha
hasn't eaten in two days,

333
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:20,818
but I am sure that she's not used
to eating processed, American food.

334
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:25,956
I don't expect you to care, but
when she is ready to eat after surgery,

335
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:28,203
she's gonna be hungry. And
she's used to corn porridge.

336
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:31,662
So while I can't make her talk, I
can't do anything about the fact

337
00:20:31,764 --> 00:20:34,998
that she is sick, that
she has advanced TB,

338
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:38,269
that she's a ten-year-old
living with AIDS, I can do this!

339
00:20:38,371 --> 00:20:40,316
I can make my patient
something she might eat.

340
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:44,825
So, unless you have more insults
for me, Dr. Stark, I'm a little busy now,

341
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:46,760
making porridge.

342
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:52,132
I tried to reason with
her. She won't listen.

343
00:20:52,234 --> 00:20:56,336
She's just sitting
downstairs in the car. I...

344
00:20:56,438 --> 00:20:58,939
I don't know what to say,
sweetheart. I'm so sorry.

345
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:04,644
- Daddy, you need to go, OK?
- Go? I'm not leaving.

346
00:21:04,747 --> 00:21:07,347
You have to go, OK?
Because if you don't,

347
00:21:07,449 --> 00:21:10,684
I will start crying and then
that will make you feel bad

348
00:21:10,786 --> 00:21:13,670
and then I will feel
worse, so you have to go.

349
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:15,606
OK.

350
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:21,392
OK.

351
00:21:32,908 --> 00:21:38,645
Is there any milk over there?
Alex. Is there any more milk?

352
00:21:38,748 --> 00:21:41,188
So you're not talking
to me now, is that it?

353
00:21:41,283 --> 00:21:45,152
You told me to shut up, so I'm just
gonna sit here and read this cereal box

354
00:21:45,254 --> 00:21:48,055
and practice keeping
my mouth shut.

355
00:21:50,926 --> 00:21:54,995
I didn't change any
data or falsify any results.

356
00:21:55,097 --> 00:21:58,415
Or switch a syringe so some sweet,
sad, old lady would get the drug

357
00:21:58,517 --> 00:21:59,684
and not the placebo?

358
00:22:01,536 --> 00:22:03,020
That's what I thought.

359
00:22:05,575 --> 00:22:08,342
Nothing I did will
change any results.

360
00:22:08,444 --> 00:22:11,312
It doesn't change the potential
effectiveness of the drug,

361
00:22:11,414 --> 00:22:13,797
- it doesn't change anything.
- Except the life

362
00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:16,144
of the guy who was supposed
to get the drug and now won't.

363
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:19,035
Look, the truth will come out.
And when the FDA investigates,

364
00:22:19,137 --> 00:22:21,432
they'll invalidate Seattle
Grace as a research institution.

365
00:22:21,456 --> 00:22:25,943
That blacklists you, Derek, every
fricking doctor in this hospital.

366
00:22:26,045 --> 00:22:30,831
This is bigger than you. It messes
with me, it messes with everyone.

367
00:22:30,933 --> 00:22:34,218
I'm a lot of things, but I'm not a
liar. I never thought you were either.

368
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,640
So, what are you
saying? You're gonna tell?

369
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:39,155
Morning.

370
00:22:43,429 --> 00:22:45,029
I'm late for work.

371
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:51,001
OK.

372
00:22:51,104 --> 00:22:53,070
All right.

373
00:22:53,172 --> 00:22:55,372
Oh...

374
00:22:57,343 --> 00:22:59,243
Oh, good. Can I
borrow something?

375
00:22:59,345 --> 00:23:03,464
It can be anything, really. A
handkerchief, a tissue, cash?

376
00:23:03,565 --> 00:23:06,233
I've got something old, new, blue.
I just need something borrowed.

377
00:23:06,335 --> 00:23:09,803
- I just got a call
from Father Brooks.
- Mm-hm.

378
00:23:09,905 --> 00:23:14,842
His wife got into an accident.
She's OK, but they're in the ER now.

379
00:23:16,611 --> 00:23:19,079
He's not gonna make
it to the wedding.

380
00:23:19,181 --> 00:23:23,683
You're kidding. Please
tell me you're kidding.

381
00:23:23,785 --> 00:23:28,171
Do you know how hard it was to
find a minister willing to marry us?

382
00:23:28,273 --> 00:23:30,513
He left me some numbers.
We can call for a replacement.

383
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:32,982
No, no. You know what? Don't
make any calls. Don't get anyone.

384
00:23:33,012 --> 00:23:36,580
Just... forget it.

385
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:43,053
I'm not getting married.

386
00:23:46,158 --> 00:23:47,758
Let's go.

387
00:23:55,568 --> 00:23:58,435
Mouse J, here, took a
turn for the worse last night.

388
00:23:58,537 --> 00:24:00,537
I did an X-ray.

389
00:24:02,258 --> 00:24:05,492
It didn't show
anything, so I did a CT.

390
00:24:06,762 --> 00:24:09,780
You did an X-ray
and a CT on a mouse?

391
00:24:09,882 --> 00:24:12,683
If there's anything in
this CT, I can't make it out.

392
00:24:12,785 --> 00:24:16,570
I couldn't either, which
is why I did an MRI.

393
00:24:16,672 --> 00:24:21,841
You did a CT and an MRI? Avery, you
have $8,000 worth of scans right here

394
00:24:21,944 --> 00:24:24,010
- for a rodent.
- Yes, sir, I understand that.

395
00:24:24,113 --> 00:24:28,949
But if you just look at the MRI.
Just look. What do you see?

396
00:24:30,786 --> 00:24:35,055
I see a little hernia. The portal
vein is not draining very well.

397
00:24:35,157 --> 00:24:37,769
Which means the problem
isn't the way the device functions.

398
00:24:37,793 --> 00:24:39,960
It's where the device functions.

399
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:46,083
We just need to put it closer to
the surface, just underneath the skin.

400
00:24:46,185 --> 00:24:47,851
Let's get started.

401
00:24:47,953 --> 00:24:49,252
Hi. You paged?

402
00:24:49,354 --> 00:24:55,058
Zola, this is Meredith.
Meredith, this is Zola.

403
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,260
Can you hold her for
a minute? Come here.

404
00:24:57,362 --> 00:25:00,214
- Sure.
- OK.

405
00:25:00,316 --> 00:25:02,633
Zola, can you
smile for me? Yeah!

406
00:25:02,735 --> 00:25:06,219
See, her facial movements are
intact. OK, look, over here. See that?

407
00:25:06,321 --> 00:25:09,640
Watch how she's tracking me?
Over here. Neuro exam is good,

408
00:25:09,742 --> 00:25:11,786
- even after the shunt.
- Great. Did something happen?

409
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:14,239
- Why did you page?
- I need to ask you
something, OK?

410
00:25:14,263 --> 00:25:16,947
- Can you excuse us
for a minute?
- Yes, doctor.

411
00:25:17,049 --> 00:25:19,583
I need you to be completely
honest with me, OK?

412
00:25:19,668 --> 00:25:22,135
If Alex said something to you...

413
00:25:22,237 --> 00:25:23,620
Let's adopt this baby.

414
00:25:24,857 --> 00:25:28,541
- What? Are you serious?
- Yeah.

415
00:25:28,643 --> 00:25:32,629
You know, I was
holding her yesterday...

416
00:25:32,731 --> 00:25:35,298
and she was crying
and then she stopped.

417
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:38,185
And I've held a lot of babies,
I've fixed a lot of babies,

418
00:25:38,287 --> 00:25:41,254
but I looked down at Zola,
I don't know what it was.

419
00:25:41,357 --> 00:25:45,359
I just couldn't imagine her being with
any other parent or any other family.

420
00:25:45,461 --> 00:25:48,728
We've been trying so
hard to start a family.

421
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:49,997
And she needs one.

422
00:25:52,017 --> 00:25:55,752
Let's adopt her. I'm serious.

423
00:25:55,854 --> 00:25:59,123
Let's adopt her.

424
00:26:06,865 --> 00:26:10,033
You realize your
door is unlocked?

425
00:26:10,803 --> 00:26:13,203
I could be anyone.

426
00:26:14,172 --> 00:26:18,075
I could be a burglar
coming to burgle you.

427
00:26:20,613 --> 00:26:22,445
Where's the baby?

428
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:27,952
Oh! I could be a babynapper
trying to babynap you.

429
00:26:30,723 --> 00:26:33,385
I know why they sent you, and
it doesn't matter what you say,

430
00:26:33,409 --> 00:26:37,161
the wedding is still off.
My mom's right. It's a joke.

431
00:26:37,245 --> 00:26:40,313
It's not a wedding.
And it's not happening.

432
00:26:40,415 --> 00:26:43,967
- Oh, Callie...
- I can't have a priest.

433
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:46,236
I no longer have a minister.

434
00:26:48,473 --> 00:26:51,275
I'm not being given away by
my dad. The wedding isn't legal.

435
00:26:51,376 --> 00:26:54,661
What's the point? This isn't a wedding.
It's not even in a church. It's nothing.

436
00:26:54,763 --> 00:26:57,730
It's a couple of girls
playing dress-up.

437
00:26:57,832 --> 00:27:01,834
It's not real.

438
00:27:01,937 --> 00:27:04,371
- It's not real.
- OK. First of all,

439
00:27:04,473 --> 00:27:07,040
you do not need
the law or a priest

440
00:27:07,142 --> 00:27:10,143
or your mother to
make your wedding real.

441
00:27:10,245 --> 00:27:14,647
And the church... The church
can be anywhere you want it to be.

442
00:27:14,749 --> 00:27:19,886
In a field, on a mountain,
right here, in this room.

443
00:27:19,988 --> 00:27:24,757
Anywhere. Because
where do you think God is?

444
00:27:26,161 --> 00:27:30,197
- Mm...
- Come on! He's in you,

445
00:27:30,299 --> 00:27:35,335
He's in me, just right
here, in the middle of us.

446
00:27:35,437 --> 00:27:37,915
Your church just hasn't
caught up to God yet.

447
00:27:37,939 --> 00:27:39,439
Your mother,

448
00:27:39,541 --> 00:27:43,843
she hasn't caught up to God yet.

449
00:27:43,945 --> 00:27:48,014
And, by the way, she
may not ever catch up.

450
00:27:48,116 --> 00:27:51,251
But it's OK. It's OK.

451
00:27:51,353 --> 00:27:56,323
If you are willing to stand
up in front of your friends

452
00:27:56,425 --> 00:27:59,125
and family and God,

453
00:27:59,227 --> 00:28:03,863
and commit yourself
to another human being,

454
00:28:03,965 --> 00:28:08,568
to give of yourself in
that kind of partnership

455
00:28:08,671 --> 00:28:13,139
for better or worse,
in sickness, in health...

456
00:28:13,241 --> 00:28:16,176
Honey, that is a marriage.

457
00:28:16,278 --> 00:28:21,648
That is real. And
that's all that matters.

458
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:27,237
Besides, girl, I got legally
married to a man in a church.

459
00:28:27,339 --> 00:28:29,506
Look how well that turned out.

460
00:28:40,068 --> 00:28:42,135
- You ready for me yet?
- Just about.

461
00:28:42,237 --> 00:28:47,140
OK, Grey. Time to repair the
VSD through the diverticulum.

462
00:28:47,242 --> 00:28:48,875
Can I have a little
suction here, please?

463
00:28:50,095 --> 00:28:51,895
- Thank you.
- Uh-huh.

464
00:28:51,997 --> 00:28:55,281
There's a small defect at
the neck of the diverticulum.

465
00:28:55,384 --> 00:28:59,069
Grey, pull up on your
pickups so I can get in there.

466
00:28:59,171 --> 00:29:01,337
- Hold the graft.
- Are you gonna use an 11 blade

467
00:29:01,439 --> 00:29:05,441
- to make the incision?
- No, she's going in blind.

468
00:29:06,678 --> 00:29:08,945
Five-0 suture.

469
00:29:11,116 --> 00:29:13,850
I'm sewing in the graft.

470
00:29:21,493 --> 00:29:25,562
Grey, would you like
to tie off when I finish?

471
00:29:25,664 --> 00:29:27,881
Yes, yes.

472
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:35,972
We addressed all the
strictures and adhesions

473
00:29:36,074 --> 00:29:39,542
without sacrificing much of the
intestines at all. Hell of a save.

474
00:29:39,644 --> 00:29:42,179
So Dr. Hunt, I understand
you have been put in charge

475
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:44,192
of determining the
next chief resident?

476
00:29:44,216 --> 00:29:46,483
With input from all of
the attendings, obviously.

477
00:29:46,585 --> 00:29:49,453
In that case, I'd like to talk
to you about April Kepner.

478
00:29:49,554 --> 00:29:54,257
I think, if you check my file, you'll
see that I rarely give formal feedback

479
00:29:54,360 --> 00:30:00,213
about my residents. When I do,
it is almost exclusively negative.

480
00:30:00,315 --> 00:30:05,118
That said, I'd very much like
to recommend April Kepner

481
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:08,589
for the chief resident position. She
goes above and beyond for her patients,

482
00:30:08,691 --> 00:30:12,959
even when she isn't asked. Well,
especially when she isn't asked.

483
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:17,631
She sees the patient as a whole,
not just as a set of symptoms.

484
00:30:17,733 --> 00:30:19,844
I tell you, that kind of
caring, that can't be taught.

485
00:30:19,868 --> 00:30:25,405
So I think this hospital would be lucky
to have her as the next chief resident.

486
00:30:25,507 --> 00:30:29,042
Hm. Thank you, Dr. Stark.
That's very good to hear.

487
00:30:29,144 --> 00:30:32,412
- And are you sure
he's still breathing?
- I'm sure, yeah.

488
00:30:34,917 --> 00:30:37,651
I couldn't have done this
without you today, Avery.

489
00:30:37,753 --> 00:30:42,122
Any of this. I really appreciate
your dedication to these mice,

490
00:30:42,224 --> 00:30:45,142
- to this project.
- Whisker twitch!

491
00:30:45,244 --> 00:30:47,511
- His whisker twitched!
- OK...

492
00:30:47,596 --> 00:30:48,873
- Come on.
- All right.

493
00:30:48,897 --> 00:30:50,647
- Come on.
- Come on, yeah.

494
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:57,621
- We did it! He's back!
- Mouse J is back, baby!

495
00:30:57,723 --> 00:30:59,856
Yeah. Excellent work.

496
00:30:59,958 --> 00:31:01,998
Keep this up, you may be
getting your own slow clap.

497
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:07,447
Robbins!

498
00:31:07,549 --> 00:31:11,084
Baby-sitter's here,
Sofia's asleep.

499
00:31:11,186 --> 00:31:14,154
I look great, by
the way. Let's go.

500
00:31:20,161 --> 00:31:21,828
Robbins, you OK?

501
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:27,661
When I came out to my brother,

502
00:31:27,685 --> 00:31:30,353
he asked me if that meant
that I was gonna marry a chick.

503
00:31:30,456 --> 00:31:34,207
And when I said yes,
he had this big smile,

504
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:40,413
and he said, "I'm gonna
dance so hard at your wedding."

505
00:31:44,185 --> 00:31:46,486
My dreams are coming true.

506
00:31:46,588 --> 00:31:48,833
Dreams I didn't
even know that I had.

507
00:31:48,857 --> 00:31:51,124
But my brother's not here.

508
00:31:51,226 --> 00:31:52,993
He's missing it.

509
00:31:53,094 --> 00:31:55,729
And I know that I'm
late, I know it, I know it.

510
00:31:55,831 --> 00:31:59,633
But why do you think that my dad
schedules every minute of every day?

511
00:31:59,735 --> 00:32:03,637
If every minute is accounted for, then
there's no time to slow down and just...

512
00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:12,612
I just... I need a minute
to miss my brother.

513
00:32:25,159 --> 00:32:28,528
Look at this list. Blood
work. Financial statements.

514
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:32,799
A home study? I mean, fire
alarms? And this is all just to see

515
00:32:32,901 --> 00:32:36,002
if the USCIS thinks that
we're suitable to adopt.

516
00:32:36,104 --> 00:32:39,505
- If you don't want
to do this...
- No, I do.

517
00:32:39,608 --> 00:32:41,541
- She could be our little girl.
- She will be.

518
00:32:41,643 --> 00:32:44,377
Look, don't get overwhelmed, OK?

519
00:32:44,479 --> 00:32:50,183
We're gonna take this list one
step at a time, one day at a time. OK?

520
00:32:51,686 --> 00:32:53,832
In fact, look, I can see
something we could cross off today.

521
00:32:53,856 --> 00:32:55,472
Look, right here.

522
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:02,328
I told you. I don't
wanna do that.

523
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:04,730
It's for the baby.

524
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:13,390
- OK. Are you ready?
- I am.

525
00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:15,525
OK, then. Let's get married.

526
00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:28,371
It's my own damn fault. Had
I minded my own business,

527
00:33:28,473 --> 00:33:32,875
the wedding would be canceled and
I'd be home looking at TV by now. Hey.

528
00:33:32,977 --> 00:33:34,556
You're gonna be fine.
You're doing great. Come on.

529
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:38,381
- OK.
- OK, right here. All right.

530
00:33:38,483 --> 00:33:40,517
- OK.
- You can let go of my hand now.

531
00:33:40,619 --> 00:33:42,352
All right.

532
00:33:43,255 --> 00:33:44,521
Hi.

533
00:33:49,211 --> 00:33:52,946
They're ready.

534
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:07,527
- Don't trip,
don't trip, don't trip.
- You're not gonna trip.

535
00:34:09,914 --> 00:34:12,732
You're right. I won't.

536
00:34:18,123 --> 00:34:20,340
OK. Um...

537
00:34:20,442 --> 00:34:23,076
Who gives this
bride to this bride?

538
00:34:24,846 --> 00:34:26,479
That'd be me.

539
00:34:28,249 --> 00:34:31,250
- Applicants Grey and Shepherd?
- That'd be us.

540
00:34:37,959 --> 00:34:41,494
- Here you go.
- Need to see some ID.

541
00:34:47,235 --> 00:34:49,335
OK, this seems to be
in order. I'll jump right in.

542
00:34:49,437 --> 00:34:53,055
We are here today to
participate in a marital union.

543
00:34:53,158 --> 00:34:58,845
To celebrate love and
happiness and loyalty

544
00:34:58,947 --> 00:35:02,382
and, in my opinion,
a little bit of magic.

545
00:35:05,254 --> 00:35:07,387
Acting in conformity to
the laws and regulations

546
00:35:07,489 --> 00:35:11,808
- of the state of Washington...
- To bring together
two exceptional

547
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:14,277
and beautiful human beings.

548
00:35:14,363 --> 00:35:16,207
Since it is your intention
to enter into marriage,

549
00:35:16,231 --> 00:35:18,865
join hands and repeat after
me. "I, Derek Shepherd..."

550
00:35:18,967 --> 00:35:24,037
- I, Derek Shepherd.
- I take you, Calliope Torres,

551
00:35:24,156 --> 00:35:27,740
- to be my wife.
- For better or for worse.

552
00:35:27,842 --> 00:35:29,926
In good times and bad.

553
00:35:30,028 --> 00:35:33,947
I choose you to be the one
with whom I spend my life.

554
00:35:34,049 --> 00:35:35,860
Do you have some token
you wish to exchange?

555
00:35:35,884 --> 00:35:39,452
- No, we didn't
have time to get rings.
- OK, we'll skip that part.

556
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,410
I love you.

557
00:35:52,684 --> 00:35:54,300
I love you.

558
00:35:56,771 --> 00:36:00,740
OK, you sign there
and you sign there.

559
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:09,348
By these acts and according to
the laws of the State of Washington...

560
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:14,620
OK, I hereby pronounce
you wife and wife.

561
00:36:20,795 --> 00:36:23,029
- Congratulations.
- Well, thank you.

562
00:36:23,832 --> 00:36:25,765
Next applicants, please.

563
00:36:47,022 --> 00:36:48,921
First dance!

564
00:37:05,206 --> 00:37:07,573
So, what happened with Teddy?

565
00:37:07,676 --> 00:37:09,575
Did you talk to her?

566
00:37:09,678 --> 00:37:12,712
So my date just called to say
she got stuck delivering a baby.

567
00:37:12,814 --> 00:37:15,982
Literally. The baby
got stuck, halfway out.

568
00:37:16,084 --> 00:37:18,902
I was wrong to doubt the
mice. Karev, watch your back.

569
00:37:19,003 --> 00:37:21,321
Mouse J has just
made me a contender.

570
00:37:21,422 --> 00:37:24,391
- Thank you, Mouse J.
- To Mouse J.

571
00:37:24,493 --> 00:37:26,526
You're not the only
contenders, you know.

572
00:37:26,628 --> 00:37:30,730
My sources tell me that
Kepner could be a dark horse.

573
00:37:30,832 --> 00:37:34,918
No offense, Dr. Hunt, but I have you
scheduled for a Swenson procedure

574
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:38,182
on a two-year-old orphan tomorrow
morning. I'm sure you understand.

575
00:37:38,206 --> 00:37:42,458
I'm just looking out for the kids
that I brought here. From Africa.

576
00:37:51,652 --> 00:37:54,888
Any idea when they're cutting the
cake? I wanted to take a piece to Adele.

577
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:57,690
Oh, I have no idea, sir.

578
00:37:57,792 --> 00:38:01,861
You know, it's funny
how things work out.

579
00:38:01,963 --> 00:38:05,198
Karev's stepped up,
Jackson's starting to shine.

580
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:07,500
There's Kepner, Grey.

581
00:38:07,602 --> 00:38:12,272
But, I always assumed that you'd be
the front-runner for chief resident, Yang,

582
00:38:12,374 --> 00:38:16,976
but just goes to show,
can't count anyone out.

583
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:21,214
I'm gonna check on that cake.

584
00:38:25,787 --> 00:38:28,507
- You want a real apology?
- Can't this wait
till work tomorrow,

585
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:31,991
- 'cause my date's
waiting for me.
- No, I'm sorry.

586
00:38:32,094 --> 00:38:35,127
I'm sorry I'm such an exceptional
surgeon that it threatens you.

587
00:38:35,229 --> 00:38:38,748
I'm sorry my surgical repair
saved Callie's life and yours didn't.

588
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:43,153
I'm sorry your ego is so fragile
that I had to stand on the sidelines

589
00:38:43,254 --> 00:38:45,789
of a surgery I should have
been performing with you today,

590
00:38:45,891 --> 00:38:48,958
but I have been standing on the
sidelines for the past three months,

591
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:51,844
basically ruining my
chances for chief resident.

592
00:38:51,946 --> 00:38:55,782
You want sincerity? I
could not be more sincere.

593
00:38:58,370 --> 00:39:02,972
And yet, you still don't get it.

594
00:39:07,028 --> 00:39:08,861
- Hey.
- Hey.

595
00:39:17,205 --> 00:39:22,175
- My glass is empty. Again.
- I, uh... I have
a proposition for you.

596
00:39:22,277 --> 00:39:25,044
Mm! I like the sound of that.

597
00:39:25,146 --> 00:39:29,398
I've been offered a position
at Landstuhl Medical Center.

598
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:34,170
In Germany? Wow.
Wow, that's, uh...

599
00:39:35,006 --> 00:39:36,706
That's an amazing facility.

600
00:39:36,808 --> 00:39:38,252
The position they
offered me is permanent.

601
00:39:38,276 --> 00:39:43,412
- - So I accepted.
On one condition.

602
00:39:43,514 --> 00:39:46,749
That they find an opening
for my incredibly talented

603
00:39:46,851 --> 00:39:49,184
cardiothoracic
surgeon girlfriend.

604
00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:53,823
- Andrew...
- I live a nomadic life,

605
00:39:53,925 --> 00:39:56,793
and it's never
bothered me till now.

606
00:39:57,996 --> 00:40:03,199
I wanna settle down, I wanna
start a life with someone.

607
00:40:03,301 --> 00:40:05,918
And I'm hoping that
that someone is you.

608
00:40:06,021 --> 00:40:10,289
<i>Just when we think
we've figured things out,</i>

609
00:40:10,392 --> 00:40:13,359
<i>the universe throws
us a curve ball.</i>

610
00:40:16,648 --> 00:40:19,565
All right, it's now time to clear
the dance floor and make way

611
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:21,534
for the father-daughter
dance, folks.

612
00:40:21,636 --> 00:40:25,138
Oh, crap. I forgot to
take that off the schedule.

613
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:27,885
- I meant to. I'm sorry.
- No, no, no. Of course you should

614
00:40:27,909 --> 00:40:30,142
get to dance with
your dad. It's OK.

615
00:40:30,244 --> 00:40:32,161
I'll just sit this one out.

616
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:34,279
- OK.
- Go ahead.

617
00:40:37,252 --> 00:40:40,670
No, you won't. I'm a
father. I can dance.

618
00:40:40,772 --> 00:40:44,039
- Let's dance.
- - <i>So we have to improvise.</i>

619
00:40:44,141 --> 00:40:48,110
Sh...

620
00:40:48,212 --> 00:40:50,813
We really need to leave if we're
gonna even make an appearance.

621
00:40:50,915 --> 00:40:53,449
Just one more minute.

622
00:40:53,551 --> 00:40:55,952
- You said that 20 minutes ago.
- What's the difference?

623
00:40:56,053 --> 00:40:59,105
Listen to her. Look at
her. Come on, listen to that.

624
00:40:59,207 --> 00:41:01,402
We're not gonna make
the wedding, are we?

625
00:41:01,426 --> 00:41:04,994
They'll understand. We'll
get them a really nice present.

626
00:41:05,096 --> 00:41:08,297
Right? Look at you. Look at her.

627
00:41:08,399 --> 00:41:10,149
Look at her!

628
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:16,622
<i>We find happiness
in unexpected places.</i>

629
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:21,911
- May I cut in?
- She's all yours.

630
00:41:22,013 --> 00:41:24,925
<i>We find our way back to the
things that matter the most.</i>

631
00:41:24,949 --> 00:41:27,449
I was driving to the airport
with your mother, and it hit me.

632
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:29,964
I've been looking forward to
dancing with you on your wedding day

633
00:41:29,988 --> 00:41:34,157
since I first held you in my arms. So I
turned the car around and came back.

634
00:41:34,258 --> 00:41:38,127
So here I am. To
have this dance.

635
00:41:38,229 --> 00:41:39,628
With my daughter.

636
00:42:09,577 --> 00:42:12,511
<i>The universe is funny that way.</i>

637
00:42:12,613 --> 00:42:16,949
<i>Sometimes, it just has a
way of making sure we wind up</i>

638
00:42:17,051 --> 00:42:19,018
<i>exactly where we belong.</i>
