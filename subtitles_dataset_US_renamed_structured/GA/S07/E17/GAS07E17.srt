1
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:04,982
<i>Renegades. Rule breakers.
Gangsters with scalpels.</i>

2
00:00:05,006 --> 00:00:06,716
<i>This is the way we like
to think of ourselves.</i>

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:11,176
<i>It makes us feel bad-ass. Sexy.</i>

4
00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:14,612
- Can you wash this,
too?
- Jackson...

5
00:00:14,714 --> 00:00:15,897
Shh.

6
00:00:24,225 --> 00:00:27,509
Is there anywhere
you don't do it?

7
00:00:30,046 --> 00:00:33,681
- We should go upstairs.
- Yeah.

8
00:00:33,783 --> 00:00:35,817
Yeah...

9
00:00:40,157 --> 00:00:43,091
<i>Problem is, it's
not exactly true.</i>

10
00:00:43,193 --> 00:00:46,495
<i>At heart, we're rule
followers. Sheep.</i>

11
00:00:46,597 --> 00:00:50,282
<i>We don't break protocol.
We follow it to a T.</i>

12
00:00:51,335 --> 00:00:54,186
Why is there a trailer
in my parking spot?

13
00:00:54,288 --> 00:00:57,122
Is one of these yours? My bad.

14
00:00:58,491 --> 00:01:01,376
You're living here? In a
trailer in the parking lot?

15
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:03,389
I'm in the race for chief
resident, you know?

16
00:01:03,413 --> 00:01:06,031
I get to the surgeries first,
I'm here when the chief arrives.

17
00:01:06,133 --> 00:01:09,284
Just get the thing out of
my spot, and move my car.

18
00:01:14,257 --> 00:01:18,327
<i>Because if we don't follow
protocol, our patients die.</i>

19
00:01:18,429 --> 00:01:21,563
<i>And then we're no longer
bad-ass. We're just bad.</i>

20
00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:23,832
When are the two of you
finally getting married?

21
00:01:23,934 --> 00:01:27,235
Um, Meredith and Derek already
got married, honey. Remember?

22
00:01:27,338 --> 00:01:31,773
I know that! They wrote on a
Post-it. I meant a real wedding,

23
00:01:31,875 --> 00:01:35,076
in a church with a white dress.
This isn't Alzheimer's, Richard.

24
00:01:35,179 --> 00:01:36,895
Adele, the tests
we ran last month

25
00:01:36,997 --> 00:01:40,248
showed findings consistent
with early-onset Alzheimer's.

26
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:43,735
I was a nurse for 30 years, Derek.
I know what Alzheimer's looks like.

27
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:47,222
I also know that 20 percent of
the people that are diagnosed with it

28
00:01:47,324 --> 00:01:52,260
turn out to have something else.
I don't have Alzheimer's. I don't!

29
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:59,801
So, a lot of patients need time to
come to terms with their diagnosis.

30
00:01:59,903 --> 00:02:02,448
- The same thing
happened to my mother.
- We don't have time.

31
00:02:02,472 --> 00:02:05,073
Derek, we need to get
Adele in on your trial right now.

32
00:02:05,175 --> 00:02:06,903
We need her consent
to even consider her.

33
00:02:06,927 --> 00:02:08,577
I'll take care of
that, don't worry.

34
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:11,274
We don't even know if she fits
the criteria, and the trial is full.

35
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:13,998
- Even the waiting list is full.
- I know all of that.

36
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:17,402
I also know that you'll do whatever
you need to do to help my wife.

37
00:02:25,813 --> 00:02:29,514
Everything looks fine. Right
on track for 23 and a half weeks.

38
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:31,850
- How's his size?
- Oh, Mark.

39
00:02:31,952 --> 00:02:35,287
It's OK. I'm used to that
trick. Its size is within the norm.

40
00:02:35,388 --> 00:02:37,523
Come on, we're here.
You know you want to know.

41
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:40,559
No, no, no, you want to know.
We prefer an element of surprise.

42
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:43,195
- Callie?
- Mark, we voted, two to one.

43
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,181
- We're waiting.
- Uh, your BP is borderline
high.

44
00:02:46,283 --> 00:02:49,868
- Are you feeling OK?
- Oh, yeah, no. That's the
nerves about the baby shower.

45
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:51,781
Yeah, it's like, um, it's
like Christmas morning.

46
00:02:51,805 --> 00:02:54,790
You are way too
excited about this.

47
00:02:54,892 --> 00:02:57,359
Hey, I have bought
expensive gifts

48
00:02:57,461 --> 00:03:00,895
and played stupid games for
every knocked up nurse in this place.

49
00:03:00,997 --> 00:03:03,064
Now, it's my turn.

50
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:05,150
You're coming, right?

51
00:03:05,252 --> 00:03:10,038
Arizona, you invite the OB. The
fate of my vagina is in her hands.

52
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:12,473
Yeah, um...

53
00:03:12,575 --> 00:03:16,628
- 1:00 pm, fourth floor
doctor's lounge.
- I'll see if I can make it.

54
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:20,465
I'll make it.

55
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:23,101
Hee.

56
00:03:31,845 --> 00:03:34,012
- What's that about?
- Chief's in the bathroom.

57
00:03:34,114 --> 00:03:36,843
- With an audience?
- His trial funding
came through this morning,

58
00:03:36,867 --> 00:03:38,367
and they all want on it.

59
00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:40,835
Door's opening!

60
00:03:40,937 --> 00:03:42,748
- My specialty!
- I'm the best one qualified.

61
00:03:42,772 --> 00:03:46,574
Wait, quiet! I haven't
made my decision yet!

62
00:03:46,676 --> 00:03:49,460
Get out of the way!

63
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:51,847
Stalking a man while
he's in the restroom?

64
00:03:51,949 --> 00:03:53,989
I'd clean the restroom if
he'd let me on this trial.

65
00:03:54,018 --> 00:03:55,879
- I'd live in it.
- You are surgeons.

66
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:59,037
If you want to impress the
chief, impress him surgically.

67
00:03:59,139 --> 00:04:00,955
- Avery, you're with me.
- OK...

68
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,925
So you've been all
buddy-buddy with Webber lately.

69
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:13,067
I'm staying out of it. But
you... you're very beautiful.

70
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:15,504
Oh, screw
beautiful! I'm brilliant!

71
00:04:15,605 --> 00:04:17,433
You wanna appease
me, compliment my brain!

72
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:18,957
OK.

73
00:04:20,878 --> 00:04:25,563
- Ah, Sonya! You ready for the big day?
- You bet.

74
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:27,410
Try to shave as little
of my head as possible.

75
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:30,747
It's hard enough dating with
Alzheimer's. I can't be bald, too.

76
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:32,404
I promise. You must be Tarik.

77
00:04:32,506 --> 00:04:34,305
Congratulations on the
marathon, by the way.

78
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:36,585
- You didn't.
- - He's not like other doctors.

79
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:38,355
He's actually
interested in his patients.

80
00:04:38,379 --> 00:04:40,039
I heard you just moved
back from London?

81
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:43,009
I came as soon as you accepted us
into the trial. I can't thank you enough.

82
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:44,177
I'm glad you're here. Thank you.

83
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:45,879
I'm gonna let Dr. Grey
get on with her work,

84
00:04:45,903 --> 00:04:47,823
and I'll see
you in a little bit.

85
00:04:49,773 --> 00:04:52,406
OK, Mrs. Amin, I'm going
to say three words to you

86
00:04:52,508 --> 00:04:56,544
and ask you to repeat them back
to me later. Truck, cabin, spoon.

87
00:04:56,646 --> 00:04:59,647
Truck, cabin, spoon.

88
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:02,550
OK. What did you do for
Thanksgiving last year?

89
00:05:02,652 --> 00:05:05,153
Oh, I was in
London visiting Tarik.

90
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,857
What? Why, is that wrong?

91
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:10,719
Last year you were at
the Simmons', remember?

92
00:05:10,761 --> 00:05:14,129
No, I was with you
and Gavin in London.

93
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:16,592
I have that picture
outside the palace.

94
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:19,384
That was three years ago,
Mom, before we broke up.

95
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:21,736
- You really should call him.
- He broke up with me.

96
00:05:21,838 --> 00:05:25,289
We're not getting back together. Sorry.
Out of all the things she can't remember

97
00:05:25,392 --> 00:05:27,859
- she still remembers the ex.
- OK.

98
00:05:27,961 --> 00:05:30,595
Starting at 100, count
backwards by seven.

99
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:33,598
One hundred, 93...

100
00:05:33,701 --> 00:05:37,435
- Good morning, Clara.
- Good's kinda pushing it.

101
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:39,838
Yeah, I hear you. Dr. Avery?

102
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:44,725
Clara Green, 42, Type 1 diabetic. Eight
weeks post-op from a tumor resection.

103
00:05:44,828 --> 00:05:46,723
You know what? No. I'm sorry.
I can't listen to the kid today.

104
00:05:46,747 --> 00:05:48,858
- I would like to hear
from the grown-up doctor.
- Sean!

105
00:05:48,882 --> 00:05:51,933
I don't want to hear from the
stupid kid anymore, I want answers!

106
00:05:52,052 --> 00:05:54,753
Sean, um, I know it's
incredibly frustrating...

107
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:58,824
You don't know. My kids are
in Iowa, living with my parents.

108
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:02,443
I barely survived that house,
now I'm inflicting it on my kids?

109
00:06:02,545 --> 00:06:04,946
Diabetes is a
bear of an illness.

110
00:06:05,065 --> 00:06:10,251
Now, the tumor removal was
successful, but we knew it could be tough

111
00:06:10,353 --> 00:06:14,506
getting the insulin levels on
track, and, yeah, it has been tough.

112
00:06:14,608 --> 00:06:16,507
Well, that's not good
enough anymore.

113
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:21,713
- We are doing everything...
- Sean?

114
00:06:21,815 --> 00:06:23,493
She's doing better
than any of us expected.

115
00:06:23,517 --> 00:06:26,312
Remember when we talked about how
she might not make it through the surgery?

116
00:06:26,336 --> 00:06:28,770
Dr. Bailey said she was
prepared to roll the dice,

117
00:06:28,872 --> 00:06:32,574
but surgery was a
gamble. And Clara rocked it.

118
00:06:32,676 --> 00:06:36,210
And if she can do that,
she can do anything.

119
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:52,277
You need any help today? Robbins
has her baby shower so I'm free.

120
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:55,947
- I still don't like you, Karev.
- Dude.

121
00:06:56,049 --> 00:06:57,465
Goodbye.

122
00:06:59,136 --> 00:07:01,686
I just finished recasting
the O'Connor girl.

123
00:07:01,789 --> 00:07:03,972
Did you still need me to
change Jason Cook's drain?

124
00:07:04,074 --> 00:07:07,291
Nope. All done. You can handle
the rest of the patients, right?

125
00:07:07,393 --> 00:07:08,787
I think we got a
thoracentesis in there.

126
00:07:08,811 --> 00:07:11,028
- Really? Thank you!
- Yeah.

127
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:13,248
We're on for tonight,
seven o'clock reservation.

128
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:16,367
- Oh, you know it!
- All right.

129
00:07:19,406 --> 00:07:21,806
You're gonna screw your
way to the top. I'm impressed.

130
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:24,776
- I am not screwing Stark.
- - "I am not screwing Stark."

131
00:07:24,862 --> 00:07:26,622
- We're not even dating.
- "We're not even dating."

132
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:29,964
I'm serious, we're not. Maybe
I thought we were at first,

133
00:07:30,067 --> 00:07:32,378
but it's not like that now.
We're just... hanging out.

134
00:07:32,402 --> 00:07:36,104
- Friends.
- Yeah. Naked friends.

135
00:07:38,942 --> 00:07:40,686
- What do you have?
- Jogger found unconscious

136
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,310
on the street. No ID.
Dr. Yang's running the code.

137
00:07:43,413 --> 00:07:45,213
- He's in V-fib!
- OK.

138
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:47,699
Clear!

139
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:58,743
You had chest pain so
you decided to go for a jog?

140
00:07:58,828 --> 00:08:00,761
- Ow! Oh.
- Sorry.

141
00:08:00,863 --> 00:08:02,808
- How much morphine
did you give him?
- Ten.

142
00:08:02,832 --> 00:08:04,810
He shouldn't be in this
much pain. Give him more.

143
00:08:04,834 --> 00:08:07,162
So, what is this, a heart attack?
'Cause it sure feels like one.

144
00:08:07,186 --> 00:08:08,998
I don't know. We're gonna
have to run some tests to find out.

145
00:08:09,022 --> 00:08:10,171
Ah.

146
00:08:11,174 --> 00:08:12,273
A jog?

147
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:14,909
Hey, it's not like I went
out for a cheeseburger.

148
00:08:15,011 --> 00:08:18,029
Her name is Clara Green.
I know it's premature,

149
00:08:18,131 --> 00:08:20,898
but I was thinking she could
be a candidate for your trial.

150
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,167
I still don't have approval
from the FDA, Bailey.

151
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:26,988
Sir, these people are desperate. If
we could make them first on the list

152
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,301
to give them something
to look forward to...

153
00:08:28,325 --> 00:08:29,802
Why not just do
the surgery today?

154
00:08:29,826 --> 00:08:31,470
Avery, just because the patient

155
00:08:31,494 --> 00:08:33,406
called you a stupid kid doesn't
mean you should act like one.

156
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:36,308
She can't even take immunosuppressants
without risking her tumor coming back.

157
00:08:36,332 --> 00:08:38,761
She's deteriorating by the hour. Why
not apply for an emergency waiver?

158
00:08:38,785 --> 00:08:41,025
Because if something
goes wrong during surgery,

159
00:08:41,071 --> 00:08:43,738
then it would kill the chief's
chance for getting approval.

160
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,540
- Sir, her kids
are stuck in Iowa...
- Dr. Avery!

161
00:08:46,643 --> 00:08:48,803
With their grandparents
who are mean, sir.

162
00:08:49,997 --> 00:08:52,830
Chief, Dr. Altman's paging you.

163
00:08:52,933 --> 00:08:55,250
I'll call the FDA, see
if we can get a waiver

164
00:08:55,352 --> 00:08:57,269
and get the patient on board.

165
00:09:01,858 --> 00:09:03,624
What? I...

166
00:09:05,579 --> 00:09:07,228
Where do you want this?

167
00:09:08,331 --> 00:09:10,882
- What's that for?
- Scrapbook station.

168
00:09:10,984 --> 00:09:12,867
Put it next to that box
with the glitter pens.

169
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:15,330
No, don't put it anywhere. We're
not having a scrapbook station.

170
00:09:15,354 --> 00:09:17,905
You heard Callie this morning.
She wants us to go all out.

171
00:09:18,007 --> 00:09:20,875
- Move the table.
- - No, don't move the table.

172
00:09:20,994 --> 00:09:23,072
Mark, this isn't a scrapbook
station kind of shower.

173
00:09:23,096 --> 00:09:25,525
You're wrong. Yang, tell her.
Torres wants all the girly stuff.

174
00:09:25,549 --> 00:09:28,550
Games, onesie decorating...

175
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:30,468
- I have a patient.
- Grey?

176
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:34,238
I can't get over the fact that you
know what onesie decorating is.

177
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,860
I've been boning up. That's what
you do for the people you love.

178
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:40,578
- Bite me, Mark.
- Oh. What's going on?

179
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:42,947
Are you guys fighting again?

180
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:44,326
Did you want a
scrapbook station?

181
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:45,744
Oh, yeah, of course.
It's not a real shower

182
00:09:45,768 --> 00:09:47,230
if you don't get to take
home a scrapbook.

183
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:49,371
Ooh! We should
have glitter pens!

184
00:09:51,908 --> 00:09:54,925
No, you can't. Because
if you quit and move here,

185
00:09:55,027 --> 00:09:57,895
you'll get depressed
and start to hate me.

186
00:09:57,997 --> 00:10:01,716
Look, I have to go. Just...
please, stop calling. Goodbye.

187
00:10:01,818 --> 00:10:03,762
We're ready, can
you bring the chart?

188
00:10:03,786 --> 00:10:06,198
- Sure.
- Sorry. The boyfriend thing's
a little more complicated

189
00:10:06,222 --> 00:10:08,156
than she can handle.

190
00:10:08,258 --> 00:10:11,509
- So you two are
still together or...?
- No. Why?

191
00:10:11,612 --> 00:10:15,747
Well, we require the caretaker to be a
full-time resident of the State of Washington.

192
00:10:15,849 --> 00:10:18,416
- I know that.
- OK. I mean,
it's a big commitment.

193
00:10:18,518 --> 00:10:21,286
And it may not feel like it
now, but six months from now,

194
00:10:21,388 --> 00:10:23,921
a year down the road,
it can get overwhelming.

195
00:10:24,023 --> 00:10:25,868
And if you think you might
move back to London,

196
00:10:25,892 --> 00:10:28,037
if there's even the slightest
chance, you need to let us know.

197
00:10:28,061 --> 00:10:31,363
Look, when I came out to my
family, my mother stood by me.

198
00:10:31,465 --> 00:10:34,065
She loved me. And I know that
may not seem like a big deal to you,

199
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:37,251
but in my family, where we come
from, being gay isn't something

200
00:10:37,353 --> 00:10:40,088
people just come to accept
after a while. It's a crime.

201
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:42,557
And people die because of it.

202
00:10:42,659 --> 00:10:45,510
My father refused to
deal with it, so he left.

203
00:10:45,612 --> 00:10:49,097
He got a new wife and
my mom lost everything.

204
00:10:49,199 --> 00:10:52,633
This is, this is the
least I can do for her.

205
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:58,222
- I'm committed to this trial,
Dr. Grey.
- OK.

206
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:01,909
Now, islet cells
produce insulin.

207
00:11:02,011 --> 00:11:05,262
We would put the cells
in a device in your body,

208
00:11:05,364 --> 00:11:08,399
and it will act like a
brand-new pancreas.

209
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:11,786
We're contacting the FDA to
get their approval right now.

210
00:11:11,888 --> 00:11:15,874
Say yes. I yelled at him this
morning, I acted like an ass.

211
00:11:15,976 --> 00:11:19,059
What are the risks? They
have to be pretty serious, right?

212
00:11:19,162 --> 00:11:21,379
Otherwise, the FDA
would've already approved it.

213
00:11:22,215 --> 00:11:23,481
Dr. Bailey?

214
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:25,961
Yeah, there are risks,

215
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:29,987
of course. I was just
about to get there. Um...

216
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:34,059
there's heavy bleeding,
uh, low platelet counts,

217
00:11:34,161 --> 00:11:36,343
um, and stress on the liver.

218
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:38,429
But in Clara's condition,

219
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:41,465
especially since we've
done everything else,

220
00:11:41,568 --> 00:11:44,485
um, this really
is the best option.

221
00:11:47,657 --> 00:11:50,975
Can we have some
more time? Is that OK?

222
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:54,161
Of course. Take all
the time you need.

223
00:11:55,499 --> 00:11:57,298
Eli?

224
00:12:02,605 --> 00:12:04,939
Go do something else.

225
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:06,518
- What was that?
- What was what?

226
00:12:06,542 --> 00:12:08,793
I was getting to those
risks. You interrupted,

227
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:10,439
made it seem like I
was hiding something.

228
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:12,063
In my experience,
doctors do hide things.

229
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:14,193
I just asked a question they
didn't know to ask, that's all.

230
00:12:14,217 --> 00:12:16,600
- No, that's not your job.
- I think it is.

231
00:12:16,702 --> 00:12:19,837
To undermine surgeons
and alarm patients?

232
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:22,190
To care for patients.
That's my job.

233
00:12:22,292 --> 00:12:24,772
Making sure they understand
what highly experimental procedures

234
00:12:24,861 --> 00:12:26,539
they're signing up for
seems a part of that.

235
00:12:26,563 --> 00:12:30,582
Oh. I thought that was my job,
especially considering that I'm the one

236
00:12:30,684 --> 00:12:33,618
who specializes in said
highly experimental procedures.

237
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:37,455
Oh. OK, I get it. You're the doctor,
I'm the nurse. I should know my place.

238
00:12:37,557 --> 00:12:39,924
OK, enough. Um...

239
00:12:40,026 --> 00:12:43,895
There is a doctor-nurse protocol
in this hospital for a reason.

240
00:12:43,997 --> 00:12:47,498
You know it, I know it.
Let's just agree to follow it.

241
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,283
Not if it hurts the patient.

242
00:12:49,385 --> 00:12:50,551
Wha...

243
00:12:55,909 --> 00:12:58,343
- Hey, you paged.
- Yeah.

244
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:00,689
I don't think I'm gonna be able
to make it to dinner by seven.

245
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:02,574
These post-ops are taking
me longer than I thought.

246
00:13:02,598 --> 00:13:04,982
OK. Skip dinner. Hey, you know,

247
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:08,820
<i>From Here to Eternity's</i> on cable.
We could just grab dinner at my place.

248
00:13:11,107 --> 00:13:16,194
OK, sounds fun. Um, I still
don't know what time I'll finish.

249
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:19,063
Karev, could you help
Dr. Kepner with her patients?

250
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:23,168
- Now you need my help?
- Don't push me, dude.

251
00:13:25,238 --> 00:13:29,974
OK, so if you take these,
then I can do the rest.

252
00:13:30,076 --> 00:13:32,594
What?

253
00:13:32,696 --> 00:13:34,206
The only way you'll
be watching that movie

254
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,430
is if it's playing on
his bedroom ceiling.

255
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:41,753
His EKG and cardiac
enzymes were normal

256
00:13:41,855 --> 00:13:43,504
so a heart attack
seems unlikely.

257
00:13:43,606 --> 00:13:46,207
We're doing a CT angio to
rule out dissection or aneurysm.

258
00:13:46,309 --> 00:13:49,393
Dr. Altman, are you
OK to stay on the case?

259
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:51,979
Considering your
personal relationship...

260
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:56,568
Richard, we've been over this. It's a
business arrangement, nothing more.

261
00:14:02,992 --> 00:14:05,092
- How're you feeling?
- Great.

262
00:14:05,194 --> 00:14:08,946
Great, great,
great, great, great.

263
00:14:09,049 --> 00:14:11,683
- Painkillers finally kicked in,
huh?
- Mm-hmm.

264
00:14:12,485 --> 00:14:14,518
Well, enjoy the ride.

265
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:18,689
I've been thinking lately,
and I think I've figured it out.

266
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:22,760
- And... Why all your dates go so bad.
- Mm.

267
00:14:22,863 --> 00:14:26,965
So, so bad. Laughably
bad. And it's not your fault.

268
00:14:27,067 --> 00:14:31,102
It's mine. 'Cause I'm... I'm
not the guy on them with you.

269
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:35,558
- We're ready to start.
- Teddy, wait, wait.

270
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:37,975
You're my wife.

271
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:39,878
- You're my hot wife.
- Henry, um...

272
00:14:39,946 --> 00:14:42,263
I'm your husband.

273
00:14:42,365 --> 00:14:44,882
Let's do it. Let's be together.

274
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:48,436
I mean, look at you.
Look at your eyes.

275
00:14:48,538 --> 00:14:50,338
You're not looking at your eyes.

276
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:53,958
I could look into your
eyes my whole life.

277
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:07,120
- Business arrangement?
- He's hopped up on painkillers.

278
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,167
Which just means his
inhibitions are down.

279
00:15:09,191 --> 00:15:14,745
Come on, Richard. Even if he meant what
he said, I don't feel that way. I don't!

280
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:16,727
And scans are up.

281
00:15:17,984 --> 00:15:19,566
Damn it. He's got a mass.

282
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:22,719
It's close to his heart. I'm gonna
have to take it out right away.

283
00:15:22,822 --> 00:15:26,306
You? I'm not sure I
should allow you in that OR,

284
00:15:26,409 --> 00:15:28,776
let alone allow you
to operate on him.

285
00:15:28,878 --> 00:15:30,389
- Chief, with all due respect...
- I can do it.

286
00:15:30,413 --> 00:15:33,431
It's an extremely
delicate surgery.

287
00:15:33,533 --> 00:15:36,667
I soloed on a similar
surgery last month. I nailed it...

288
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:38,969
- is what you said.
- Problem solved.

289
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:41,617
- Yang'll do the surgery, you'll supervise.
- - Chief.

290
00:15:41,641 --> 00:15:46,393
I've made my decision,
Dr. Altman. Now, if you'll excuse me.

291
00:15:48,964 --> 00:15:50,409
He was gonna kick
you out of the OR.

292
00:15:50,433 --> 00:15:53,451
At least, this way you
get to stay in. It's win-win.

293
00:15:59,608 --> 00:16:02,560
- Yay!
- Whoo!

294
00:16:02,662 --> 00:16:05,380
Don't feel bad. I've
known Torres a long time.

295
00:16:05,482 --> 00:16:07,531
She's a traditional
girl. Catholic.

296
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:11,652
This whole baby out of wedlock
thing, the three parents, it's a lot

297
00:16:11,754 --> 00:16:14,350
for her to swallow. That's why I
figured the bigger shower the better.

298
00:16:14,374 --> 00:16:17,090
- Oh, shut up.
- Excuse me?

299
00:16:17,192 --> 00:16:18,976
You're not the Callie Whisperer.

300
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:22,029
And I'm not a monster for
finding baby showers annoying.

301
00:16:22,131 --> 00:16:24,293
Every woman who's ever had
a pregnant friend hates them.

302
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:27,362
It's like a wedding, the bridesmaids
always want to strangle the bride.

303
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:30,466
It's practically a rule. The only
one who's not normal here is you

304
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,417
for acting like
you're enjoying this.

305
00:16:32,441 --> 00:16:34,358
OK, Arizona's turn!

306
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:39,441
Um, I'm fine, I'm fine
over here. But thanks.

307
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:42,817
Oh, just 'cause I'm the pregnant
one doesn't mean you don't get to play.

308
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:44,618
Come on, it'll be fun!

309
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,672
- It's what the bride wants.
- Oh.

310
00:16:56,232 --> 00:16:57,598
Hey!

311
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,183
Yay!

312
00:16:59,285 --> 00:17:01,585
I'm going.

313
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:10,528
Hey. I'm glad you came.
I know it's awkward.

314
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:12,897
No, you know...
It's... It's not. It's...

315
00:17:12,999 --> 00:17:16,434
I'm... I'm happy for you.

316
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:19,636
And, uh, plus, I'm seeing
somebody else, so it's...

317
00:17:19,739 --> 00:17:22,356
- Really?
- Yeah.

318
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:25,258
That's, uh... Good for you.

319
00:17:28,531 --> 00:17:30,514
Do I know him?

320
00:17:31,317 --> 00:17:33,301
I should go.

321
00:17:51,086 --> 00:17:54,755
I know they're not paying you
well, but this seems a little extreme.

322
00:17:54,857 --> 00:17:57,507
I just moved into my own
place. I don't have time to shop.

323
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:59,794
Pass me those cookies.
All these people in here,

324
00:17:59,896 --> 00:18:03,197
and you came to talk
to me? You like me.

325
00:18:03,299 --> 00:18:06,901
No, I'm talking to you because I want
something to eat and you're in the way.

326
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:09,470
Admit it, you find me charming.

327
00:18:09,572 --> 00:18:12,423
- Are those pigs in a blanket?
- Hot.

328
00:18:12,525 --> 00:18:16,143
- Dirty hot.
- It was good talking to you,
Dr. Karev.

329
00:18:20,016 --> 00:18:23,217
I say he's totally gay.

330
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:26,237
Well, if he were gay, then
why would he ask April out?

331
00:18:26,339 --> 00:18:29,139
No straight guy waits a whole
month before making a move.

332
00:18:29,225 --> 00:18:33,160
- Maybe he has herpes.
- That wouldn't stop a guy
either. I vote gay.

333
00:18:33,262 --> 00:18:36,497
I just wish he was into me. Then I
could be in all his cool surgeries, too.

334
00:18:36,599 --> 00:18:38,965
He's not gay, he
doesn't have herpes

335
00:18:39,068 --> 00:18:41,079
and I'm not using him
to get cool surgeries.

336
00:18:41,103 --> 00:18:44,605
We have a lot to talk about, OK? He's
really interesting once you get to know him.

337
00:18:44,707 --> 00:18:47,942
- Which is why she's taking her pants off for him tonight.
- - What?

338
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:51,195
She's going to his place. <i>From
Here to Eternity's</i> playing on cable.

339
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:54,231
Oh, yeah, pants are
definitely coming off.

340
00:18:54,316 --> 00:18:57,034
- Nobody's pants are coming off.
- A movie at his place?

341
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,880
That's the definition
of pants coming off.

342
00:18:58,904 --> 00:19:01,488
- Virgin's a goner.
- With an older man, too.

343
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:04,992
- It's very impressive.
- I'm not taking off my pants
for Stark!

344
00:19:09,865 --> 00:19:13,034
- Oh, my God, that is so ugly.
- Are you still blind?

345
00:19:13,136 --> 00:19:17,904
- I like it. It's abstract.
- Check it out. Scrubs.

346
00:19:18,024 --> 00:19:20,174
Yes, I will do a consult now.

347
00:19:20,276 --> 00:19:21,742
You're not fooling anyone!

348
00:19:31,254 --> 00:19:33,838
- Chief.
- Uh, Derek, I need a favor.

349
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:36,357
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm applying for an emergency
waiver

350
00:19:36,459 --> 00:19:38,909
with the FDA. I need you to
call your guy that helped you

351
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:41,978
through your trial over there, see
if he can push my request through.

352
00:19:42,081 --> 00:19:44,481
I'll see what I can do, but
you're the chief of surgery.

353
00:19:44,584 --> 00:19:46,344
I'm not sure how much
more pull I'm gonna have.

354
00:19:46,368 --> 00:19:51,238
There's always ways to work the
system, Derek, we both know that.

355
00:19:51,341 --> 00:19:54,942
I can't put Adele on my trial,
Richard. I've looked at it all day.

356
00:19:55,044 --> 00:19:59,713
- Well, go over it again.
- You're not hearing me.

357
00:19:59,815 --> 00:20:03,467
I love Adele, but I can't pull
a patient off the waiting list.

358
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:06,820
It could compromise the whole trial.
It could get us blacklisted by the FDA.

359
00:20:06,922 --> 00:20:10,241
- Adele has no future without this!
- - Chief?

360
00:20:10,343 --> 00:20:13,444
It... It's Clara Green,

361
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:15,395
you need to come now.

362
00:20:22,455 --> 00:20:24,650
What happened?

363
00:20:24,674 --> 00:20:26,390
Sugar bottomed out
again. No response.

364
00:20:26,492 --> 00:20:29,510
- Why won't she wake up?
- Uh, she's in a hypoglycemic
coma.

365
00:20:29,612 --> 00:20:31,523
Her sugar dropped
too fast so her brain

366
00:20:31,547 --> 00:20:33,491
doesn't have enough to feed on.

367
00:20:33,515 --> 00:20:35,578
Sats are dropping and she's got
rales. I'm gonna set up to intubate.

368
00:20:35,602 --> 00:20:38,518
- What? Wait, what's going on?
- Mr. Green, there's no time to
wait.

369
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:41,722
If we're gonna try this islet cell
transplant, we need to do it now.

370
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:43,891
We just need your consent.

371
00:20:46,496 --> 00:20:48,662
Yeah, of course. You do
whatever you need to do.

372
00:20:48,764 --> 00:20:50,615
All right. Let's book an OR.

373
00:20:50,717 --> 00:20:52,894
Sir, the FDA hasn't
given us the waiver.

374
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:54,062
- I know that.
- But...

375
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,886
This woman will die
without this surgery.

376
00:20:55,988 --> 00:20:58,222
Now book an OR. Now!

377
00:21:02,861 --> 00:21:05,663
I don't understand, why does
Dr. Yang have to do the surgery?

378
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:07,643
You and I are
technically married,

379
00:21:07,667 --> 00:21:11,001
and the hospital
doesn't allow doctors

380
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:14,571
- to treat family members.
- Mm-hmm.

381
00:21:14,673 --> 00:21:18,025
Right, because how can you stay objective
when your feelings get in the way?

382
00:21:18,127 --> 00:21:21,595
Is it wrong that I'm a little flattered
that, uh, you won't operate on me?

383
00:21:23,766 --> 00:21:27,818
Dr. Yang is excellent and
I will be there to supervise.

384
00:21:28,604 --> 00:21:30,036
I'll see you in surgery.

385
00:21:31,357 --> 00:21:36,027
- She's into me, right?
- Can I have your arm, please?

386
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:40,464
So this Karev guy, you're
actually friends with him?

387
00:21:40,566 --> 00:21:42,866
- That's real?
- Yeah. Why?

388
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:46,553
Uh, it surprises me is all. You don't
seem like the type of girl to put up

389
00:21:46,655 --> 00:21:51,776
with his whole Neanderthal thing.
So... tell me, what am I missing?

390
00:21:51,878 --> 00:21:54,611
You're missing a lot.

391
00:21:54,714 --> 00:21:57,914
He had a girl go crazy on
him. His wife almost died,

392
00:21:58,017 --> 00:22:00,985
and then she walked out on
him. And then he was shot,

393
00:22:01,087 --> 00:22:04,567
and almost bled to death in an
elevator. He's been through a lot.

394
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:08,142
So the Neanderthal
thing is just... It is an act.

395
00:22:10,112 --> 00:22:11,878
A well-executed one.

396
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:16,578
We are through the peritoneum
and ready for the implant.

397
00:22:16,602 --> 00:22:18,585
- Anything from the FDA?
- Nothing, chief.

398
00:22:20,072 --> 00:22:23,824
- Damn it.
- Sir, I think we should wait.

399
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:25,446
The longer we wait,
the worse she gets.

400
00:22:25,477 --> 00:22:27,327
I know, but...

401
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:29,663
Are you sure we're doing
this for the right reason?

402
00:22:29,782 --> 00:22:34,051
That you're not trying to prove
a point, to Shepherd maybe?

403
00:22:34,153 --> 00:22:37,871
I'm thinking of my patient
here, Bailey, that's all.

404
00:22:39,207 --> 00:22:41,341
Hybrid device.

405
00:22:42,711 --> 00:22:48,298
Implanting it in the omentum,
near the large intestine loops.

406
00:22:48,401 --> 00:22:50,241
I left my phone when
I went to the cafeteria.

407
00:22:50,303 --> 00:22:53,743
She saw Gavin's name so she picked
up. Please, you can't let her do this.

408
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:55,523
We'll talk to her, don't worry.

409
00:22:57,443 --> 00:23:01,745
- What's going on, Sonya?
- I'm not doing
the trial.

410
00:23:01,847 --> 00:23:05,199
- I'm sorry if I've wasted
your time.
- Mom, just listen to him.

411
00:23:05,301 --> 00:23:09,836
I don't have to. I'm going home,
and you're going to London. It's done.

412
00:23:09,955 --> 00:23:12,456
Sonya, you were chosen
from hundreds of applicants.

413
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:16,476
And this surgery, I can't
guarantee anything, but it could help.

414
00:23:16,578 --> 00:23:18,562
There won't be another
opportunity like this.

415
00:23:19,715 --> 00:23:22,349
I'm sorry, I've made up my mind.

416
00:23:22,451 --> 00:23:25,302
- Please, take me off your list.
- She's not lucid, Dr. Shepherd.

417
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:27,565
This is just the Alzheimer's.
She's already consented.

418
00:23:27,589 --> 00:23:29,824
My name is Sonya Lela Amin.

419
00:23:29,926 --> 00:23:34,345
I was born Sonya Beshari. My parents
were Ahmed and Saleemah Beshari.

420
00:23:34,447 --> 00:23:36,363
I live at 3105 River Road.

421
00:23:36,465 --> 00:23:39,744
I spent last Thanksgiving with the
Simmons, but three years before,

422
00:23:39,768 --> 00:23:43,436
I was in London with Gavin.
Who did not break up with you.

423
00:23:43,539 --> 00:23:48,742
You broke up with him last
week, when I got on the trial.

424
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:51,879
You did that for me, and
that makes me very proud.

425
00:23:52,865 --> 00:23:55,131
I raised a good son.

426
00:23:58,571 --> 00:24:00,587
You are a good son.

427
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:03,623
Go back to London.
Be with Gavin.

428
00:24:07,813 --> 00:24:11,882
Ready to resect
the tumor. Bovie.

429
00:24:11,984 --> 00:24:13,317
Slow and steady.

430
00:24:13,419 --> 00:24:14,785
Any disturbance to his heart,

431
00:24:14,887 --> 00:24:16,632
and he could go into
hypertensive crisis.

432
00:24:16,656 --> 00:24:20,190
- He's pre-medicated,
I'm all over it.
- Steady, Yang.

433
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:22,927
- I got it.
- Good. Good.

434
00:24:23,029 --> 00:24:26,196
Now, just irrigate and explore.

435
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:28,715
- BP's shooting up.
- - What did you do, Cristina?

436
00:24:28,817 --> 00:24:30,183
I don't know. Suction.

437
00:24:30,285 --> 00:24:32,503
- Damn it, Cristina!
- I got it. Don't worry.

438
00:24:32,605 --> 00:24:35,572
All right, check
for residual tumor.

439
00:24:35,675 --> 00:24:37,975
I am. You know, I need
more light. Pickups!

440
00:24:38,077 --> 00:24:42,847
Hurry up! Come on! Did
you find anything? Cristina.

441
00:24:42,949 --> 00:24:45,749
Cristina, I need you need
to talk to me, right now.

442
00:24:45,851 --> 00:24:47,412
- Do you need me to do this?!
- I need you to shut up

443
00:24:47,436 --> 00:24:50,036
and stop acting
like a scared wife!

444
00:24:50,139 --> 00:24:52,305
There, I got it. I...

445
00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:53,773
I got it.

446
00:24:58,731 --> 00:25:02,966
- I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...
- No. No, it's OK. It's just...

447
00:25:04,637 --> 00:25:06,370
Thank you.

448
00:25:12,812 --> 00:25:16,229
- Hey, Richard.
- I just did
my first trial surgery

449
00:25:16,332 --> 00:25:19,632
without FDA approval.
Maybe they'll take my license,

450
00:25:19,734 --> 00:25:22,936
maybe they'll blacklist me.
You know what? I don't care.

451
00:25:23,055 --> 00:25:25,539
- I saved a life.
- Yes... Richard.

452
00:25:25,641 --> 00:25:29,009
- Yeah?
- Someone just
dropped out of my trial.

453
00:25:33,566 --> 00:25:37,568
That's why you dragged me
back in here? For another test?

454
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:40,230
It's just a few questions to see
if you meet the criteria, honey.

455
00:25:40,272 --> 00:25:44,191
And then what? I let Derek
drill into my brain for no reason?

456
00:25:44,293 --> 00:25:47,310
I just did a surgery that
I wasn't approved to do.

457
00:25:47,396 --> 00:25:49,441
I did it because I knew I
didn't have any time to wait.

458
00:25:49,465 --> 00:25:53,817
The patient would've
died. It's the same for you.

459
00:25:56,238 --> 00:25:59,372
You have Alzheimer's,
honey. You do.

460
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:01,992
There's no time
to wait to treat it.

461
00:26:02,094 --> 00:26:04,895
Please, take the test, baby.

462
00:26:05,681 --> 00:26:07,381
Do it for me.

463
00:26:08,634 --> 00:26:12,736
Fine. I'll take the test.

464
00:26:12,838 --> 00:26:17,057
- Thank you.
- But I'm going to pass.

465
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:21,628
That way, you'll
see I'm fine. Healthy.

466
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:25,632
We're going to grow old
together, just like we always said.

467
00:26:25,734 --> 00:26:30,270
We're going to
grow old together.

468
00:26:30,372 --> 00:26:33,273
What is that, a
tumbleweed? A hurricane?

469
00:26:34,627 --> 00:26:37,321
- What's your problem?
- Someone threw out
the gift list.

470
00:26:37,345 --> 00:26:39,624
Now, we don't know who got what
and people are gonna think of us

471
00:26:39,648 --> 00:26:42,044
as the type of people who write
vague and impersonal thank-you notes.

472
00:26:42,068 --> 00:26:44,084
I'm not sure that's
actually a type of people.

473
00:26:45,938 --> 00:26:48,455
- What's going on?
- Arizona lost the gift list.

474
00:26:48,557 --> 00:26:52,743
Yes, Mark, I lost the
list. I... I suck at this.

475
00:26:52,845 --> 00:26:54,539
Congratulations, you're
a better woman than I am.

476
00:26:54,563 --> 00:26:58,949
Hey, it's OK, it's
OK. It's not a big deal.

477
00:26:59,051 --> 00:27:00,466
Mark, can you give us a minute?

478
00:27:03,689 --> 00:27:06,807
- She lost the gift list,
not me.
- Mark.

479
00:27:08,443 --> 00:27:13,080
So, there is one
more gift left to open.

480
00:27:13,182 --> 00:27:16,616
Oh, I... I didn't
get you anything.

481
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:18,651
You got me a shower.

482
00:27:19,188 --> 00:27:21,020
Open it.

483
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:24,869
It's a B&B a few hours away.
We leave in the morning.

484
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:27,094
But I have patients.
You have patients.

485
00:27:27,196 --> 00:27:30,230
Look, I'm extending
an olive branch here.

486
00:27:30,332 --> 00:27:33,517
Because I know how annoying
I must be to you right now.

487
00:27:33,619 --> 00:27:36,131
But since I was four and I got that
doll that craps its pants for Christmas,

488
00:27:36,155 --> 00:27:39,940
I wanted a kid because other
than cracking bones, this...

489
00:27:40,042 --> 00:27:43,077
this baby is my dream.

490
00:27:43,179 --> 00:27:48,698
And I get to be insanely out of
my mind happy for my dream.

491
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,112
But I'm not discounting your
need to vomit over my insanity.

492
00:27:51,136 --> 00:27:56,990
So just let me take you to a stupid
B&B for the weekend. Thank you.

493
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:08,302
What did you do for
Thanksgiving last year?

494
00:28:08,404 --> 00:28:10,637
Hmm... Nothing.

495
00:28:10,739 --> 00:28:13,140
Uh, Richard and I stayed home,

496
00:28:13,242 --> 00:28:16,776
ordered in Chinese,
and it was lovely.

497
00:28:20,916 --> 00:28:26,302
OK. Starting at 100,
count backwards by seven.

498
00:28:26,404 --> 00:28:31,858
One hundred, 93, 86...

499
00:28:33,112 --> 00:28:35,912
The Rodriguez boy had an
incarcerated incisional hernia,

500
00:28:36,014 --> 00:28:38,059
but we did conscious sedation
and were able to reduce it.

501
00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:41,501
This is all while I was in
surgery. I am impressed.

502
00:28:41,603 --> 00:28:43,443
Dr. Karev did
most of it, actually.

503
00:28:43,489 --> 00:28:45,355
Oh, Dr. Karev? OK,
it's good to know.

504
00:28:45,457 --> 00:28:47,051
I'll check to make
sure it was done right.

505
00:28:47,075 --> 00:28:49,092
Robert, just say thank you.

506
00:28:49,194 --> 00:28:52,078
Thank you, Dr. Karev.
Now, go away.

507
00:28:53,682 --> 00:28:57,217
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry. I
didn't mean to call you that.

508
00:28:57,319 --> 00:28:58,763
There's no need to
apologize, Dr. Kepner.

509
00:28:58,787 --> 00:29:01,027
No, it was completely
unprofessional.

510
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:06,092
- I promise I won't...
- Hey, April,
I'm saying I liked it.

511
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:16,069
- I... I can't make it tonight.
- To...? What?

512
00:29:17,373 --> 00:29:20,407
Um... The new chief
resident is getting picked soon,

513
00:29:20,509 --> 00:29:22,742
and everyone is
stepping up their game.

514
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:28,215
So I should probably just
stay late here. Work. I'm sorry.

515
00:29:30,502 --> 00:29:33,570
I understand. We
got the age difference,

516
00:29:33,672 --> 00:29:35,672
we work together...

517
00:29:36,642 --> 00:29:40,444
not to mention you
are very beautiful.

518
00:29:40,545 --> 00:29:44,831
But still, you know, I'd hoped you
wouldn't feel the need to use work

519
00:29:44,933 --> 00:29:48,218
as an excuse to get out
of spending time with me.

520
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,504
No, no, no, I wasn't...

521
00:29:50,605 --> 00:29:55,392
I enjoy spending time
with you, so much.

522
00:29:55,494 --> 00:30:00,313
It's just... I guess I just
think of you more as a friend.

523
00:30:00,416 --> 00:30:02,966
Friends. You know,
we're... we're friends.

524
00:30:03,068 --> 00:30:05,519
Yeah. Well...

525
00:30:06,422 --> 00:30:09,222
But that's the thing, you know?

526
00:30:09,324 --> 00:30:12,009
I never wanted to
be just your friend.

527
00:30:15,564 --> 00:30:17,530
Good night, Dr. Kepner.

528
00:30:23,505 --> 00:30:25,538
You needed to
score a 26 or below

529
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,507
to meet the
criteria of the trial.

530
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:31,194
You were above that.

531
00:30:31,296 --> 00:30:34,180
- What is it?
- It's not important.

532
00:30:34,283 --> 00:30:35,732
Derek...

533
00:30:37,553 --> 00:30:41,588
- It's 27.
- One point?

534
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:44,958
You're going to deny her
this because of one point?

535
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:48,361
- I'm so sorry.
- Sorry? No. It's good.

536
00:30:48,463 --> 00:30:50,497
It means I passed. I...

537
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:54,267
I'm not sick. I
told you, Richard.

538
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:58,371
That's not what it means.

539
00:30:59,424 --> 00:31:02,259
You have Alzheimer's.

540
00:31:02,361 --> 00:31:05,278
It just hasn't progressed
enough to get into the trial.

541
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:10,033
But Derek said I
passed. I passed.

542
00:31:10,135 --> 00:31:15,355
Meredith, I'm OK, right?

543
00:31:15,457 --> 00:31:19,126
When I asked you to repeat
the three words back to me,

544
00:31:19,227 --> 00:31:21,461
you said "pool"
instead of "spoon."

545
00:31:22,698 --> 00:31:25,298
I asked you to identify
my stethoscope,

546
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:28,251
it took you a while
to find the word.

547
00:31:30,288 --> 00:31:34,174
And I asked you where
you took your honeymoon.

548
00:31:35,394 --> 00:31:38,662
And you said Hawaii,
but you were here

549
00:31:38,764 --> 00:31:42,065
because the chief
was a medical student

550
00:31:42,167 --> 00:31:45,034
and he had to work.

551
00:31:48,073 --> 00:31:51,074
You're just a resident,
what do you know?

552
00:31:51,176 --> 00:31:55,378
What the hell do any of you
know?! You work in a hospital all day

553
00:31:55,480 --> 00:32:01,084
around sick people and disease.
You're obsessed. That's what this is.

554
00:32:01,186 --> 00:32:04,154
So I got a few answers wrong.

555
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:06,256
That's all? It's normal.

556
00:32:06,358 --> 00:32:09,092
To forget things at my age...

557
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:14,548
You can never remember where you parked
the car whenever we go to the movies,

558
00:32:14,650 --> 00:32:17,184
and they're not
saying that you have...

559
00:32:19,087 --> 00:32:21,338
It's not fair.

560
00:32:22,874 --> 00:32:26,009
I finally... It's...

561
00:32:27,045 --> 00:32:30,580
We're finally happy, you and me.

562
00:32:30,682 --> 00:32:36,286
Loving each other the way we
should have all these years, and now...

563
00:32:36,388 --> 00:32:39,022
It's not fair!

564
00:32:41,593 --> 00:32:46,646
Don't look at me like that,
like I'm damaged goods.

565
00:32:46,748 --> 00:32:50,550
I'm still me, I'm still here!

566
00:32:52,487 --> 00:32:55,088
I'm still me. I...

567
00:32:57,426 --> 00:32:59,992
Maybe, maybe I won't
be here much longer,

568
00:33:00,095 --> 00:33:03,896
but I'm right here,
baby. I'm right here.

569
00:33:03,998 --> 00:33:08,284
I can't do... I'm so scared.

570
00:33:08,386 --> 00:33:10,853
Richard, help me, please.

571
00:33:10,955 --> 00:33:13,390
I'm so scared.

572
00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:15,992
You can help me.

573
00:33:16,094 --> 00:33:19,262
Please. Please.

574
00:33:20,749 --> 00:33:25,085
I'm here. I'm not
going anywhere.

575
00:33:25,187 --> 00:33:27,771
I'm here.

576
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:41,784
Clara Green's extubated,
her sats are 100 percent

577
00:33:41,887 --> 00:33:45,288
and her glucose levels are
stable. No organ damage.

578
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:48,258
- It's working, chief. It's working!
- Good.

579
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:51,210
'Cause I just talked to the
FDA. They gave us a waiver.

580
00:33:53,715 --> 00:33:56,399
I just heard the waiver
came through. We did it, right?

581
00:33:56,485 --> 00:33:58,534
You know, a good
chief resident would be...

582
00:33:58,636 --> 00:34:00,920
You need to pick a
chief resident already.

583
00:34:01,022 --> 00:34:04,357
Alex Karev is living in a
trailer in the hospital parking lot,

584
00:34:04,476 --> 00:34:07,093
residents are waiting for
you outside bathrooms.

585
00:34:07,195 --> 00:34:09,362
Karev's living in
the parking lot?

586
00:34:10,516 --> 00:34:12,482
Your trial is up and running,

587
00:34:12,584 --> 00:34:14,913
and you've got things
to deal with at home.

588
00:34:14,937 --> 00:34:18,704
You don't need to be picking
a new chief resident, too.

589
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:21,658
Let somebody else
handle that. Delegate.

590
00:34:22,461 --> 00:34:24,628
OK. I'd like you to.

591
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:26,530
No. I raised those babies.

592
00:34:26,632 --> 00:34:31,134
Um, what I mean is, delegate
to someone else. Who is not me.

593
00:34:31,219 --> 00:34:33,620
- Good night, Dr. Bailey.
- Good night.

594
00:34:33,722 --> 00:34:38,674
And sir? Congratulations
on the surgery.

595
00:34:44,166 --> 00:34:47,500
It was a clean excision,
and we got clean margins.

596
00:34:47,602 --> 00:34:51,354
- You're gonna be OK.
- So, what I said before,

597
00:34:51,456 --> 00:34:55,141
about your eyes, it
wasn't just the painkillers.

598
00:34:55,243 --> 00:34:59,529
Henry, you've got to stop. You
gotta stop talking to me about my eyes,

599
00:34:59,631 --> 00:35:02,165
and flirting with me in
front of other doctors.

600
00:35:02,267 --> 00:35:06,269
- You're right. I'm sorry.
- OK.

601
00:35:07,872 --> 00:35:09,422
OK, I'm not sorry.

602
00:35:10,709 --> 00:35:12,726
I meant what I said.

603
00:35:12,828 --> 00:35:14,561
All of it.

604
00:35:14,663 --> 00:35:16,062
If not more.

605
00:35:16,965 --> 00:35:20,132
I get it. It's a great story.

606
00:35:20,235 --> 00:35:23,369
We get married
to save your life.

607
00:35:23,471 --> 00:35:26,505
Then we fall in love. I
mean, how romantic is that?

608
00:35:26,608 --> 00:35:30,476
Not to mention
that you are smart

609
00:35:30,579 --> 00:35:37,350
and funny and not at
all hard on the eyes.

610
00:35:37,452 --> 00:35:41,254
And I'd be lying to say that
it's never crossed my mind.

611
00:35:43,959 --> 00:35:46,943
But I don't feel it. It's...

612
00:35:48,279 --> 00:35:52,582
It's not real. It's
just a good story.

613
00:35:54,869 --> 00:35:57,637
What's so wrong
with a good story?

614
00:35:58,407 --> 00:36:00,506
I'm sorry.

615
00:36:11,053 --> 00:36:14,287
Did you hear back from the
patient on the waiting list?

616
00:36:14,389 --> 00:36:16,689
I haven't called yet.

617
00:36:16,791 --> 00:36:18,652
Maybe Richard's
right. It's just one point.

618
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:20,988
But it's a point that could
ruin the trial for everyone else

619
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:23,913
- that we're trying to save.
- Hmm.

620
00:36:24,532 --> 00:36:25,865
Call them.

621
00:36:34,208 --> 00:36:37,477
Well, I heard the good
news. Our patient's doing well.

622
00:36:37,579 --> 00:36:41,965
- Sorry, your patient, doctor.
- Eli, I'm tired.

623
00:36:42,067 --> 00:36:45,062
Good. Then just admit I was
right so we can kiss and make up.

624
00:36:45,086 --> 00:36:47,486
Not that tired.

625
00:36:49,074 --> 00:36:53,443
Miranda Bailey, we are
not inside the hospital!

626
00:36:53,545 --> 00:36:56,446
Inside the hospital, you're
the man. That's the protocol.

627
00:36:56,548 --> 00:37:01,467
But outside, I'm the
man. I am the man. Me.

628
00:37:01,569 --> 00:37:04,454
Now you can call me
Cro-Magnon or old-fashioned,

629
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:07,390
but that is not gonna stop me from
taking you home to my bed tonight

630
00:37:07,492 --> 00:37:09,642
and showing you
what kind a man I am.

631
00:37:09,744 --> 00:37:13,179
Now how's that? Does
that protocol suit you?

632
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:18,851
- Yeah.
- Good.

633
00:37:23,825 --> 00:37:27,093
Mmm. Be at my place in 15.

634
00:37:34,519 --> 00:37:35,999
Hey!

635
00:37:39,541 --> 00:37:41,974
- This is your new place?
- You hungry?

636
00:37:42,076 --> 00:37:46,078
I got crab cakes,
cucumber sandwiches.

637
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:49,281
You ate all the pigs
in a blanket, so...

638
00:37:50,168 --> 00:37:51,334
I'll take a beer.

639
00:38:04,866 --> 00:38:09,235
So this was your plan? Wait for me
on the stoop of your trailer you squat in?

640
00:38:09,337 --> 00:38:13,790
- What?
- You were waiting for me.

641
00:38:13,892 --> 00:38:16,092
'Cause you find me charming.

642
00:38:17,162 --> 00:38:18,682
- Hot.
- What? No, I...

643
00:38:18,747 --> 00:38:22,298
And now, you're stuttering
because I intimidate you.

644
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,134
Whatever.

645
00:38:24,236 --> 00:38:28,788
Which explains it really, why you
haven't made a move this whole time.

646
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:31,891
- That's complete bull...
- And now...

647
00:38:35,279 --> 00:38:37,814
you're forcing me to do it.

648
00:38:40,501 --> 00:38:42,402
Ah. So was I right?

649
00:39:02,023 --> 00:39:03,756
- OK.
- Do you mind?

650
00:39:03,858 --> 00:39:07,560
Nope. Although if it were me and
I had someone to make out with,

651
00:39:07,662 --> 00:39:09,929
I might want to do it in
private. Like in a room.

652
00:39:10,031 --> 00:39:11,997
Where there's a door that locks.

653
00:39:19,507 --> 00:39:22,142
OK. Let's go upstairs.

654
00:39:30,535 --> 00:39:33,302
<i>It's every doctor's dilemma.</i>

655
00:39:33,404 --> 00:39:36,139
<i>Do you play it safe
and follow protocol?</i>

656
00:39:38,059 --> 00:39:42,595
Yep. Actual, real dinner in honor
of me rocking my surgery today.

657
00:39:42,697 --> 00:39:47,116
If Webber doesn't pick me
for chief resident, he's an idiot.

658
00:39:47,219 --> 00:39:49,452
<i>Or take a risk and
invent a new one?</i>

659
00:39:49,554 --> 00:39:51,234
- Cristina.
- Yes, darling.

660
00:39:53,458 --> 00:39:56,726
Richard just asked me to
take over picking chief resident.

661
00:39:58,496 --> 00:40:01,714
Oh, my God, this is
awesome! You can...

662
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:07,103
Oh, my God, this sucks!
This sucks! You can't pick me.

663
00:40:07,205 --> 00:40:10,557
Everyone's gonna say it's
because you're my husband. This...

664
00:40:10,659 --> 00:40:14,393
No! No! What?
No! This is... What?!

665
00:40:14,496 --> 00:40:17,497
Oh, God, how can you eat?!
This is not fair, wait, wait, wait!

666
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:19,431
No, no, no! This... No!

667
00:40:26,474 --> 00:40:29,675
<i>There can be reward in risk.</i>

668
00:40:30,712 --> 00:40:32,345
<i>There can also be fallout.</i>

669
00:40:34,049 --> 00:40:36,293
We've been gone
all of ten minutes,

670
00:40:36,317 --> 00:40:38,395
what could Mark possibly want?

671
00:40:38,419 --> 00:40:39,619
I don't know.

672
00:40:39,721 --> 00:40:42,621
Ooh... Oh... yeah.

673
00:40:42,723 --> 00:40:46,392
OK, this is bad. He found out
Lexie's with Avery. He's freaking.

674
00:40:47,595 --> 00:40:49,240
Oh!

675
00:40:49,264 --> 00:40:51,314
- Just let go!
- What the hell?!

676
00:40:51,416 --> 00:40:54,784
What, this, this is time
for us. It's just for us.

677
00:40:54,886 --> 00:40:56,263
The first thing you
wanna do is talk to Mark.

678
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:58,904
You just said it was
OK! OK, you know what?

679
00:40:59,006 --> 00:41:01,435
- Screw it. I'm gonna talk to him!
- What are you doing?

680
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:04,093
Don't you dare call him! I...

681
00:41:04,195 --> 00:41:07,680
This is jealousy, Arizona.
You're jealous of Mark. Get over it.

682
00:41:07,782 --> 00:41:10,683
Do you blame me?
He gets most of you.

683
00:41:10,785 --> 00:41:14,453
The straight you, the Catholic
you, the girl who loves baby showers.

684
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:17,735
I just get the gay you, which is
really only about 20 minutes a night,

685
00:41:17,759 --> 00:41:20,087
and not even, since you feel too
fat to even let me touch you lately.

686
00:41:20,111 --> 00:41:23,429
Look, I am doing my best here,
to make sure that you are happy

687
00:41:23,531 --> 00:41:27,216
and that Mark's happy and the tiny
person growing inside me is happy!

688
00:41:27,319 --> 00:41:30,186
I don't know what else I can
do, to be honest! Please, tell me.

689
00:41:30,288 --> 00:41:33,339
'Cause I'll do it. Whatever
will make you happy, I will do it.

690
00:41:38,013 --> 00:41:41,798
<i>Still, you need to buck the
system every once in awhile.</i>

691
00:41:41,899 --> 00:41:43,483
<i>Bet big.</i>

692
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:47,920
Marry me.

693
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:52,592
- What?
- I mean it.

694
00:41:52,694 --> 00:41:55,995
I love you more than anything.

695
00:41:56,097 --> 00:41:59,482
But I want more. I want
commitments. I want rings.

696
00:42:00,552 --> 00:42:02,418
So...

697
00:42:05,023 --> 00:42:06,121
marry me.

698
00:42:06,223 --> 00:42:08,183
<i>And when you get
the results you want,</i>

699
00:42:08,242 --> 00:42:10,343
<i>there's no better
feeling in the world.</i>

700
00:42:10,445 --> 00:42:12,762
<i>But when you don't...</i>
