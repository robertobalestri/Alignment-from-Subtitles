1
00:00:04,105 --> 00:00:06,005
<i>After a trauma,</i>

2
00:00:06,107 --> 00:00:09,341
<i>your body is at its
most vulnerable.</i>

3
00:00:09,443 --> 00:00:12,343
<i>Response time is critical.</i>

4
00:00:14,447 --> 00:00:17,248
<i>So you're suddenly
surrounded by people.</i>

5
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:19,785
<i>- Doctors, nurses...</i>
<i>- </i> Focus, focus.

6
00:00:19,887 --> 00:00:21,715
<i>- Specialists, technicians.</i>
<i>- </i> You got it, you got it!

7
00:00:21,739 --> 00:00:23,338
- Go!
- <i>Surgery is a team sport.</i>

8
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,917
A little more!
A little bit more!

9
00:00:24,941 --> 00:00:27,008
<i>Everyone pushing
for the finish line.</i>

10
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:29,378
- Yes!
- Yay, fingers!

11
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:30,690
Yeah. Yeah.

12
00:00:30,714 --> 00:00:33,232
<i>Putting you back together again.</i>

13
00:00:35,802 --> 00:00:38,019
It's OK, you're
retraining your brain.

14
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:40,355
Getting your fingers straight
was the goal for today.

15
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:42,157
Little goals, remember?

16
00:00:42,259 --> 00:00:44,204
All right, let me in there
to check her incision.

17
00:00:44,228 --> 00:00:46,261
Morning. Baby report.

18
00:00:46,363 --> 00:00:48,380
- Boom!
- I'm gonna go see her.

19
00:00:48,482 --> 00:00:51,349
- Hey. You're awesome.
- Gimme, gimme, gimme.

20
00:00:51,452 --> 00:00:53,635
See? She's moving her
arm like she's waving.

21
00:00:53,737 --> 00:00:56,349
She still hasn't opened her eyes,
but she only stopped breathing once

22
00:00:56,373 --> 00:00:59,508
last night and, get this, her
brain bleed's still grade one.

23
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:04,563
Good girl! She looks bigger.

24
00:01:05,866 --> 00:01:07,065
Is she bigger?

25
00:01:08,284 --> 00:01:10,636
All right, some of
us are still working.

26
00:01:10,738 --> 00:01:13,571
- Let me get in there, please.
- OK. I have a consult. I have to go.

27
00:01:13,673 --> 00:01:15,290
How are you?

28
00:01:16,209 --> 00:01:19,144
I... almost got
my hand straight.

29
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:22,397
- That's great!
- Yeah.

30
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:25,183
<i>But surgery is a
trauma in and of itself.</i>

31
00:01:25,286 --> 00:01:28,186
So today? I can see her today?

32
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:32,473
<i>And once it's over,
the real healing begins.</i>

33
00:01:32,576 --> 00:01:34,843
<i>- We call it recovery.</i>
- I'm sorry...

34
00:01:34,945 --> 00:01:38,580
- No. No!
- But until you can be mobilized

35
00:01:38,682 --> 00:01:43,202
and your infections are completely
gone, you cannot see her.

36
00:01:43,304 --> 00:01:46,121
And she cannot leave the NICU.

37
00:01:46,223 --> 00:01:51,210
Now, you know I would if I
could. You know that. Right...

38
00:01:51,312 --> 00:01:53,845
<i>Recovery is not a team sport.</i>

39
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:57,349
- Yang, tell her I would.
- Mm-hm? Mm-hm.

40
00:01:57,451 --> 00:01:59,801
She would, if she could.

41
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,737
<i>It's a solitary distance run.</i>

42
00:02:02,839 --> 00:02:05,740
- Are you giving me the finger?
- Yes, I am.

43
00:02:05,842 --> 00:02:08,377
Good job.

44
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,962
<i>It's long, it's exhausting...</i>

45
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:16,117
<i>and it's lonely as hell.</i>

46
00:02:19,506 --> 00:02:22,874
<i>Mrs. Pulcher, you're gonna
have to stop the smoking.</i>

47
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:26,127
- Your infections
are getting worse.
- Your infections, you mean.

48
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:29,113
I didn't have them before
you two idiots operated,

49
00:02:29,216 --> 00:02:30,377
and you didn't
even do that right.

50
00:02:30,401 --> 00:02:32,967
Again, I'm sorry,
but your lung cancer

51
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:35,587
- had spread to the point...
- Please. Useless.

52
00:02:35,689 --> 00:02:38,923
I can afford any
hospital in the world,

53
00:02:39,009 --> 00:02:42,894
and I come to this third-rate crap
factory. When am I getting out of here?

54
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:45,364
I've been here for three
weeks. This is not Guantanamo.

55
00:02:45,466 --> 00:02:47,643
Discharge her.
Please. I'll pay you.

56
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:51,102
There's not much more that we can
do unless you're willing to help yourself.

57
00:02:51,205 --> 00:02:53,988
- Now, the smoking...
- If I wanted a lecture
on smoking,

58
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:59,227
I'd dig up my dead husband. Now, get
me outta here before I sue your balls off.

59
00:02:59,329 --> 00:03:01,896
Well, we'll run some tests.
And if your white blood cell count

60
00:03:01,999 --> 00:03:05,967
- is up to an acceptable
level...
- How high does it have to be?

61
00:03:06,086 --> 00:03:08,536
- Give me a number.
- It's at a point-eight now.

62
00:03:08,638 --> 00:03:10,305
- I'd like it to be above a two.
- One.

63
00:03:10,407 --> 00:03:14,843
- This is not a negotiation.
- Everything is. One-point-five.

64
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:17,262
One-point-five and
you let me outta here.

65
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:20,326
Now, get me a wheelchair. 'Cause
if I have to wait around this hellhole,

66
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:24,636
- I'm gonna smoke.
- OK.

67
00:03:30,644 --> 00:03:35,363
Oh! I smoothed out some bumps in
the NICU surgery protocol if you want to...

68
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:37,598
stop acting like a child.

69
00:03:37,701 --> 00:03:40,263
You crushed his heart, April,
and none of us thought he had one.

70
00:03:40,287 --> 00:03:42,082
- So that's impressive.
- It's inconvenient.

71
00:03:42,106 --> 00:03:44,706
I need him to sign this.

72
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:47,809
- Uh... morning.
- Oh. Good morning.

73
00:03:47,911 --> 00:03:51,379
- Another Alzheimer's
trial patient?
- Yes, sir.

74
00:03:51,498 --> 00:03:52,897
Good, good.

75
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:57,969
How's your islet cell trial going?
Have you found a resident to assist you?

76
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:01,456
- Yeah. Avery's gonna
help me out today.
- Great. Good.

77
00:04:01,558 --> 00:04:04,876
And Mrs. Webber?
How is she feeling?

78
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:08,063
She's doing all
right. Thank you.

79
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,749
Oh, sir...

80
00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:17,122
You...

81
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:29,384
Wow, that kid looks screwed.

82
00:04:29,486 --> 00:04:33,188
He is. He has five different
cardiac and abdominal defects.

83
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:34,801
I'm supposed to operate
on him next week.

84
00:04:34,825 --> 00:04:36,958
That's awesome. Can I scrub in?

85
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:39,438
Yeah, if you can
get us to Africa.

86
00:04:39,462 --> 00:04:41,024
I was supposed to go
back there next week, but

87
00:04:41,048 --> 00:04:44,065
now I have a very
sick little girl of my own

88
00:04:44,167 --> 00:04:46,751
- and a fiancee in the ICU.
- Fly him out here.

89
00:04:46,854 --> 00:04:51,957
Yeah, I've tried. But you can't
imagine the red tape and the money.

90
00:04:52,059 --> 00:04:56,327
And there's a dozen more like him
that I want to do the same thing for.

91
00:04:56,429 --> 00:04:59,147
I'm trying to find someone
to help him out over there.

92
00:04:59,249 --> 00:05:02,817
I just... I made a
promise, that's all.

93
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:07,873
It's healing pretty well.

94
00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:10,441
Maybe in a couple of days
you can try sitting up by yourself.

95
00:05:10,544 --> 00:05:13,194
- Let's try now.
- You can't rush it.

96
00:05:13,296 --> 00:05:17,098
Why did I get you? Why aren't
you cutting out hearts somewhere?

97
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,686
Well, Altman and
I had a falling out,

98
00:05:20,788 --> 00:05:23,070
over your ventricular
septal defect, actually.

99
00:05:23,172 --> 00:05:26,924
I'm just giving her some
space. OK, you're good.

100
00:05:27,026 --> 00:05:29,695
- You need anything?
- I need to see my baby.

101
00:05:35,469 --> 00:05:37,602
She's mostly tubes and wires.

102
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:40,305
And she looks more like
a chicken than a baby.

103
00:05:40,407 --> 00:05:44,842
Like a featherless, beakless
chicken. You want to wait...

104
00:05:44,944 --> 00:05:47,962
- until she's cuter.
- You are the worst godmother
ever.

105
00:05:48,064 --> 00:05:50,565
You picked me.

106
00:05:50,667 --> 00:05:52,901
She opened her eyes. Sofia!

107
00:05:53,003 --> 00:05:56,238
She looked right at me! I
saw her sweet, little eyes!

108
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:59,324
They're beautiful.
They look just like yours!

109
00:05:59,426 --> 00:06:01,659
Oh, my God, I should
have taken pictures!

110
00:06:01,762 --> 00:06:04,763
Why didn't I do that?!

111
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:08,650
Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh,
God, no! I'm so sorry...

112
00:06:08,752 --> 00:06:11,620
Go, go, go, go! Go get the
pictures! Go get the pictures!

113
00:06:11,721 --> 00:06:15,574
Callie. Callie.

114
00:06:17,027 --> 00:06:20,045
No, don't. Callie! Callie, stop
it. Stop it, stop it, stop it! Callie!

115
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:22,341
- You'll rupture your sutures.
- I'm missing her! I am missing her.

116
00:06:22,365 --> 00:06:26,050
- I know, honey. I know.
- She could die and I'll
never...

117
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:28,503
- I could miss her whole life!
- OK, OK.

118
00:06:28,605 --> 00:06:30,455
Easy, easy, relax.

119
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:32,591
Lie back down.

120
00:06:37,114 --> 00:06:40,648
- Pulse is 102.
- Are you nervous, Ed?

121
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:43,868
Yeah, it's kinda like going
to the dentist, only worse.

122
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:46,121
This is gonna be over
before you even know it starts.

123
00:06:46,222 --> 00:06:49,408
Dr. Grey is gonna do the drill now.
You're not gonna feel anything, though.

124
00:06:55,782 --> 00:06:59,117
- Ed. Try and relax, OK?
- I can't.

125
00:06:59,219 --> 00:07:01,114
All right, stop.
Stop. Just pull back.

126
00:07:01,138 --> 00:07:02,865
Let's get the halo
off, he's having an MI.

127
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:04,723
OK. Flatline!

128
00:07:11,782 --> 00:07:13,164
What the hell happened?!

129
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:24,792
- His EKG was fine?
- He never complained
of chest pain.

130
00:07:24,894 --> 00:07:26,722
I did the work-up, there
was nothing in his history.

131
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:28,629
It wasn't your fault.
It was a massive MI.

132
00:07:28,731 --> 00:07:30,699
After we inform
Mr. Beckert's family,

133
00:07:30,801 --> 00:07:32,784
I will call the FDA
and file a formal report.

134
00:07:32,886 --> 00:07:34,430
Is there a chance they
could shut down the trial?

135
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:35,454
It doesn't matter.

136
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:37,906
I'm gonna shut it down,
pending the autopsy.

137
00:07:38,008 --> 00:07:41,443
I want to know why
we didn't see it coming.

138
00:07:43,113 --> 00:07:45,513
I thought Dr. Bailey said
Torres can't be moved yet.

139
00:07:45,615 --> 00:07:47,560
Yes, sir, but since she has
had no contact with the baby,

140
00:07:47,584 --> 00:07:49,862
- I was wondering
how soon we might...
- Bring the baby to Torres?

141
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,619
I think it'll do the
both of them good.

142
00:07:51,722 --> 00:07:55,373
- If I could at least
tell Dr. Torres...
- When the baby is off the vent.

143
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:59,160
When she has an immune system
and can withstand the onslaught

144
00:07:59,262 --> 00:08:03,080
of deadly infections Dr. Torres
would threaten her with. That's when.

145
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:06,868
I mean, come on! I'm all
for mother-baby bonding,

146
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:09,210
but not when
it'll kill the baby.

147
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:11,734
Why do you even
ask me these things?

148
00:08:11,758 --> 00:08:14,159
I thought you were a doctor.

149
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:17,011
Ouch.

150
00:08:20,884 --> 00:08:22,483
I need your help with something.

151
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:29,740
Oh, wait! I have
patient 122's trial packet.

152
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:32,162
It was never opened, so it
needs to go back into the lot.

153
00:08:32,212 --> 00:08:33,611
OK, one sec.

154
00:08:37,534 --> 00:08:38,833
I heard about your patient.

155
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:40,446
- I'm sorry.
- Thank you.

156
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:42,637
- Have a good night.
- You, too.

157
00:08:48,128 --> 00:08:51,329
Henry, will you
just open the door?

158
00:08:51,431 --> 00:08:54,132
I'm sorry, the place is... You
were just supposed to tell me

159
00:08:54,234 --> 00:08:56,880
if this is normal or if I need
to... if I need to go to the hospital.

160
00:08:56,904 --> 00:08:59,453
Will you just sit
down and be quiet?

161
00:08:59,555 --> 00:09:01,200
Did you check your blood sugar?

162
00:09:01,224 --> 00:09:03,692
Fifty-six. But I
don't have any juice.

163
00:09:03,794 --> 00:09:06,911
- I just have
half a can of diet soda.
- OK, OK.

164
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:10,632
- Damn it. Look at you.
- What?

165
00:09:10,734 --> 00:09:12,628
You look amazing. You
were on a date, weren't you?

166
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:14,047
I made you come here
in the middle of a date.

167
00:09:14,071 --> 00:09:16,438
No, you know what?
Actually, you saved me

168
00:09:16,539 --> 00:09:19,907
from the longest date
with the most tedious man.

169
00:09:20,009 --> 00:09:22,505
The only good thing that came
out of the date were these cannolis.

170
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:24,845
Which, as it turns out, is
exactly what someone needs

171
00:09:24,947 --> 00:09:27,215
when they're having a
hypoglycemic episode.

172
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:29,595
- You still shouldn't have come.
- You know what? You'll stop saying that

173
00:09:29,619 --> 00:09:31,252
once you try this.

174
00:09:32,688 --> 00:09:33,721
Mm!

175
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:36,057
- Yeah. OK.
- Good.

176
00:09:36,175 --> 00:09:39,010
- Tell me about this date.
- Well...

177
00:09:39,112 --> 00:09:41,379
Mm. His name is Erwin.

178
00:09:41,481 --> 00:09:43,548
- Ooh.
- Mm.

179
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:45,867
OK, so strike one.

180
00:09:48,938 --> 00:09:50,655
No!

181
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:53,541
Give me that.

182
00:09:57,047 --> 00:09:59,431
So am I leaving?
What's my number?

183
00:10:00,534 --> 00:10:01,599
It's not good.

184
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:04,603
Not your opinion,
stupid. Number.

185
00:10:04,705 --> 00:10:06,137
Point-six.

186
00:10:07,924 --> 00:10:09,657
It's gone down.

187
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:15,813
I'm sorry the results
weren't better.

188
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:19,684
You should be, you worthless
bastard. It's all your fault.

189
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:25,389
Get out of my sight. I can't stand
looking at your stupid face! Go!

190
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:34,332
- How'd she take it, Karev?
- Bitchy. 'Cause she's a bitch.

191
00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:38,837
She's also dying. She's alone.
She hasn't had any family or visitors

192
00:10:38,939 --> 00:10:40,799
- since she got here.
- Well, maybe that's 'cause...

193
00:10:40,823 --> 00:10:44,191
Let's keep our
assessments to ourselves.

194
00:10:46,863 --> 00:10:49,463
Karev, what's your
plan for chief resident?

195
00:10:50,217 --> 00:10:51,716
- My plan?
- Mm.

196
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:53,451
Besides badmouthing patients.

197
00:10:53,553 --> 00:10:56,131
All your colleagues are showing
some kind of leadership potential.

198
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:58,957
Grey and Avery,
they're on clinical trials,

199
00:10:59,059 --> 00:11:01,804
Kepner's overhauling the surgical
checklists. They have a plan.

200
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:04,428
- I was just wondering if you...
- African kids!

201
00:11:04,531 --> 00:11:07,365
- Sorry?
- I'm gonna bring over about

202
00:11:07,467 --> 00:11:10,835
a dozen kids from Africa
and get them surgeries.

203
00:11:10,937 --> 00:11:13,270
Badly needed surgeries.

204
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:18,075
- Hm. Sounds pretty ambitious.
- I'm an ambitious guy.

205
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:20,389
It also sounds like you just
pulled that outta your butt.

206
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:22,947
Oh, no, sir. It's
a... It's a plan

207
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:25,950
that I've been... planning.

208
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:30,387
OK. Well, good. Let
me know if I can help.

209
00:11:31,657 --> 00:11:34,875
- Right outta your butt.
- Shut up.

210
00:11:34,978 --> 00:11:37,528
Are you guys
ready? Let's do this.

211
00:11:45,772 --> 00:11:47,638
Wake up.

212
00:11:50,944 --> 00:11:55,146
Just lay still and relax. Let us
do everything. Can you do that?

213
00:12:09,779 --> 00:12:12,129
Tell him that cholie
moved to 8:30 tomorrow.

214
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:14,198
Back, back, back.

215
00:12:15,551 --> 00:12:17,768
OK.

216
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,972
Dr. Bailey.

217
00:12:21,057 --> 00:12:25,643
- Can I ask you something?
- What is it?

218
00:12:25,746 --> 00:12:28,896
- How's your day going?
- How's my day going?

219
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:33,201
My day should have
ended three hours ago.

220
00:12:33,303 --> 00:12:34,836
I'm tired, it's late,

221
00:12:34,938 --> 00:12:37,049
and I still have six more
things to do before it's over,

222
00:12:37,073 --> 00:12:40,908
and now I have you in my face
asking me how my day is going.

223
00:12:43,713 --> 00:12:45,846
OK, OK, OK, OK.

224
00:13:16,613 --> 00:13:19,096
We'll give you some privacy.

225
00:13:24,654 --> 00:13:26,587
Oh.

226
00:13:33,028 --> 00:13:35,329
Hi.

227
00:13:36,966 --> 00:13:39,551
Hi, baby.

228
00:13:41,705 --> 00:13:43,571
Don't worry.

229
00:13:43,673 --> 00:13:45,857
See? I'm...

230
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:48,626
I'm a little messed up, too.

231
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:52,379
But we're gonna be fine, OK?

232
00:13:54,216 --> 00:13:56,550
We're gonna be just fine.

233
00:14:05,111 --> 00:14:07,478
- Hey.
- Hey. How is Mr. Beckert's wife?

234
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:11,615
- Her kids took her home. I can't believe they lied to us.
- They didn't lie.

235
00:14:11,718 --> 00:14:15,703
They just left out the history of his heart
problems because they needed this trial.

236
00:14:15,805 --> 00:14:19,373
While we're waiting for the FDA
to respond, I wanna re-screen

237
00:14:19,475 --> 00:14:21,337
all the applicants
with a fine-tooth comb.

238
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:23,801
- Is that what you're doing now?
- No. As morbid as it sounds,

239
00:14:23,846 --> 00:14:26,463
I'm trying to find a
replacement for Mr. Beckert.

240
00:14:26,565 --> 00:14:29,300
- A new Patient 122?
- We'll need to have one ready.

241
00:14:29,402 --> 00:14:32,486
- OK. So, what about Adele
Webber?
- Meredith. You know I want to,

242
00:14:32,588 --> 00:14:35,973
but she's just not far enough along.
Her disease has not progressed enough

243
00:14:36,076 --> 00:14:37,920
for her to be eligible for
this trial. You know that.

244
00:14:37,944 --> 00:14:40,828
Well, this fell off of Richard's
sweater this morning.

245
00:15:02,768 --> 00:15:04,051
<i>Breathe.</i>

246
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:05,713
- Breathe.
- No!

247
00:15:05,788 --> 00:15:08,355
She can't talk to me like
that! I'm a trained professional.

248
00:15:08,457 --> 00:15:12,059
- She's an uncooperative,
insulting...
- Fiancee of mine.

249
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:15,712
- So let's just... let's watch it.
- He's a wuss! Let him go!

250
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,733
Good luck.

251
00:15:20,186 --> 00:15:21,906
That's the third one this month.

252
00:15:21,955 --> 00:15:24,739
- They don't push me
hard enough.
- It's a traumatic brain injury.

253
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:27,491
- It's not boot camp.
- We're getting married.

254
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:30,706
- You want me walking down the
aisle, not rolling, right?
- I want you healed.

255
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:34,415
It's OK. The wedding can...

256
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:37,501
Sorry! I'm sorry.

257
00:15:41,591 --> 00:15:44,575
The baby won't wait.
You can pick her up.

258
00:15:44,678 --> 00:15:47,323
You can hold the baby. Mark can
hold the baby. I can't hold my baby!

259
00:15:47,347 --> 00:15:49,913
Don't tell me it's OK!

260
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,838
I'm sorry.

261
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:01,408
Then bring me
those balls, please.

262
00:16:04,998 --> 00:16:09,200
I've got eight patients lined
up from three African countries,

263
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:14,221
all through the Namboze
Clinic. There's a... Wait.

264
00:16:16,659 --> 00:16:21,396
Here. A cardiac defect, a brain
tumor, an idiopathic gangrene case.

265
00:16:21,498 --> 00:16:24,231
When do we get to see
that, right? What else?

266
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:29,987
Oh, and Hunt, he got me in touch with
a military guy about ground transport.

267
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:32,401
And he also volunteered
to operate, pro bono.

268
00:16:32,425 --> 00:16:36,644
So I've got him and Robbins,
Bailey, Sloan, Shepherd...

269
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:38,646
Stop.

270
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:40,258
How are you gonna
pay for all this?

271
00:16:40,282 --> 00:16:41,660
Well, that's why
I'm talking to you.

272
00:16:41,684 --> 00:16:43,562
You're the chief
of Peds surgery.

273
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:45,826
I mean, they're
incredible surgeries.

274
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:49,774
- On kids.
- OK. This is coming
out of my budget?

275
00:16:49,876 --> 00:16:53,010
I'm saying, if I do
all the logistical crap,

276
00:16:53,112 --> 00:16:54,890
it's a project the hospital
should fund, right?

277
00:16:54,914 --> 00:16:58,049
- It's worth...
- Nothing. That's what it's
worth. No.

278
00:16:58,151 --> 00:17:01,868
I'm sorry.

279
00:17:04,624 --> 00:17:07,508
Right. I should have
known what you'd say.

280
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:10,043
No. You don't get to do that.

281
00:17:10,146 --> 00:17:13,414
You don't get to ask me to
fund a plan this half-assed,

282
00:17:13,516 --> 00:17:17,785
and then paint me as somebody who wants
to deny health care to Third World kids.

283
00:17:17,887 --> 00:17:20,637
Come on.

284
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:23,974
I mean, there are people
that can do this sort of thing,

285
00:17:24,076 --> 00:17:27,060
but you're not one of 'em.

286
00:17:33,002 --> 00:17:35,869
- Mrs. Pulcher.
- Ooh.

287
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:38,205
Is it two hours already? Ow.

288
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:41,291
Seems like I saw your
slack jaw a minute ago.

289
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:43,911
I feel like I just saw
your blistery old butt.

290
00:17:44,013 --> 00:17:46,613
Don't... You can't
speak to me like that.

291
00:17:46,716 --> 00:17:48,149
You can't speak to me like that.

292
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:53,237
I should sue you ten grand
for every bedsore on my ass.

293
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:56,457
I'll die before I ever see
any of that money, but I'll...

294
00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:00,210
- But you'll die rich.
- Richer, thanks to you
dumbasses.

295
00:18:03,949 --> 00:18:07,051
Or you could do something
good with the money.

296
00:18:07,153 --> 00:18:10,437
Donate it to a good
cause. Help someone out.

297
00:18:10,539 --> 00:18:15,126
Or put it to getting
you a medical degree?

298
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:22,099
Mrs. Pulcher, I have a plan to
bring some African kids over here

299
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:24,769
for some really cool...

300
00:18:24,871 --> 00:18:28,605
I mean, desperately
needed surgeries.

301
00:18:28,707 --> 00:18:30,558
You asking me for money?

302
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,827
I need at least a hundred grand

303
00:18:32,928 --> 00:18:35,179
- to get things started.
- Oh, my God!

304
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:39,733
Take it somewhere else, Sally
Struthers. And get out of my face!

305
00:18:45,358 --> 00:18:48,509
Overall, Adele scored a
23, which is a marked decline

306
00:18:48,611 --> 00:18:51,262
from the last time we
tested her, which was 27.

307
00:18:51,364 --> 00:18:53,831
So she's definitely a lot
worse than we thought.

308
00:18:53,933 --> 00:18:55,716
Well, the upside is
she gets in the trial.

309
00:18:55,818 --> 00:18:57,718
- But she's declining so fast.
- I know.

310
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:00,398
Why can't we just give her the
medicine on the side, outside of the trial?

311
00:19:00,422 --> 00:19:01,872
- Who would know?
- No.

312
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,852
The FDA is going to be
on us harder than ever.

313
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:06,677
Anything we do that taints
the results would ruin the trial,

314
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:09,329
and not to mention
our careers along with it.

315
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:12,183
Don't think I haven't
thought about it.

316
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:17,254
She's in heart failure. She's
gotta go back on the vent.

317
00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:19,756
- She needs surgery now?
- As soon as possible.

318
00:19:19,858 --> 00:19:23,260
Her ductus arteriosus
hasn't closed.

319
00:19:23,363 --> 00:19:24,562
Fletcher's a no-go.

320
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:26,346
I'm gonna try Terry
Lennox at Seattle Pres.

321
00:19:26,448 --> 00:19:29,683
I know I'm not high on your
list, but your baby's out of time.

322
00:19:29,785 --> 00:19:32,653
You know it can't be you. I've
performed the procedure before.

323
00:19:32,755 --> 00:19:36,707
- So... you're stuck with me.
- I understand.

324
00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:39,476
Although you're not
technically related to the baby...

325
00:19:39,578 --> 00:19:42,412
- I'm sorry, what?
- The hospital would have no

326
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:45,332
ethical objection if I let
you be in the OR with me.

327
00:19:47,336 --> 00:19:49,414
If you'd like to look
over my shoulder.

328
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:52,706
You know, make
you feel any better.

329
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:58,273
- Thank you.
- OK.

330
00:19:58,297 --> 00:19:59,680
We'll page you when we're ready.

331
00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:02,316
- Thanks.
- I'll go tell Callie.

332
00:20:04,003 --> 00:20:07,571
- So should I get her prepped?
- Looks like I'm stuck with you,
too.

333
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:11,775
- You ready to go back?
- Mm-mm. One more lap.

334
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:14,490
- Did you lose a bet?
- She's my new physical
therapist.

335
00:20:14,514 --> 00:20:17,481
- Because she does
what I tell her to.
- Whose charts are those?

336
00:20:17,584 --> 00:20:19,783
Altman's. She's
being ridiculous.

337
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:21,785
I haven't seen a cardio
surgery in a month.

338
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,455
- So you stole her charts?
- Yes, I stole her charts

339
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:26,717
so I will be prepared when
she comes crawling back.

340
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:28,625
Grey, sit, I need
the resistance.

341
00:20:30,746 --> 00:20:33,897
So I re-tested Adele Webber.
She's worse than we thought.

342
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:36,359
But at least she's
gonna get in the trial.

343
00:20:36,436 --> 00:20:39,036
OK, see? See, I
should be on this!

344
00:20:39,138 --> 00:20:42,506
How do I even have a shot at chief
resident if I can't do what I'm good at?

345
00:20:42,608 --> 00:20:44,486
Alex, you didn't!
You're gonna be fired!

346
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:47,644
- I'm gonna be chief resident.
- Not if you don't work here
anymore.

347
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:50,680
- He solicited
a patient for money.
- You're hooking now?

348
00:20:50,783 --> 00:20:53,767
- For my African kid thing.
- It's against so many rules!

349
00:20:53,869 --> 00:20:55,936
Who cares?! The old hag
could die leaving her money

350
00:20:56,038 --> 00:20:59,272
to save dying children, but instead
she'll probably leave it to her cats,

351
00:20:59,374 --> 00:21:01,842
who probably hate her, too.
Are you going to Radiology?

352
00:21:01,961 --> 00:21:05,012
Hey, everybody off now.

353
00:21:07,633 --> 00:21:10,668
- Callie.
- I did four laps today.

354
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,953
Sofia needs surgery.

355
00:21:14,056 --> 00:21:16,323
- What?
- Today. Now. She has weakness

356
00:21:16,425 --> 00:21:18,420
in her left ventricle, she
needs a PDA ligation.

357
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:21,062
- Oh, God.
- She's gonna be fine.

358
00:21:21,164 --> 00:21:22,530
I'm gonna be there.

359
00:21:22,632 --> 00:21:23,726
- Ow!
- What?

360
00:21:26,936 --> 00:21:28,479
- Callie!
- Oh, God.

361
00:21:28,503 --> 00:21:30,037
Oh...

362
00:21:30,889 --> 00:21:33,657
Oh, my... Help!

363
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:35,726
Somebody help!

364
00:21:39,765 --> 00:21:43,300
Abdominal wound dehiscence
with a small evisceration.

365
00:21:43,402 --> 00:21:45,302
She's worked
herself into a rupture.

366
00:21:45,404 --> 00:21:48,083
I should have seen this coming. I
should have forced her to stop walking.

367
00:21:48,107 --> 00:21:49,534
I checked that wound
three times a day.

368
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:51,586
- She never complained of pain.
- Yang, I've been telling Torres

369
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:54,060
to slow down for weeks.
The woman doesn't listen.

370
00:21:54,162 --> 00:21:56,491
So stop kicking yourself
and just help me fix it.

371
00:21:56,515 --> 00:21:58,999
- Bovie.
- How bad does it look?

372
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,037
- How is she?
- They're just starting now.

373
00:22:04,139 --> 00:22:07,541
- BP's 39 over 20.
- <i>That's way too low.</i>

374
00:22:07,643 --> 00:22:09,171
No. For a kid
this small, it's fine.

375
00:22:09,195 --> 00:22:10,489
The talking is a
little distracting.

376
00:22:10,513 --> 00:22:13,747
I'm sorry. I have to hang up.

377
00:22:13,849 --> 00:22:16,801
I didn't say hang up. Just
keep it down, please. Potts?

378
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:27,211
You're dumber than you look!

379
00:22:32,701 --> 00:22:35,118
I'm gonna have your job.

380
00:22:35,671 --> 00:22:37,355
Nurse!

381
00:22:37,457 --> 00:22:40,140
- "Help me, Mrs. Pulcher."
- Nurse!

382
00:22:40,242 --> 00:22:43,176
- I'm gonna call your
supervisors!
- "You're my only hope."

383
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:44,956
- I'm gonna have you fired.
- "I need your help."

384
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:47,531
- Then I'm gonna sue
this hospital.
- "Please."

385
00:22:47,633 --> 00:22:49,516
- Then I'm gonna sue you!
- "Please!"

386
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:50,884
Get out!

387
00:22:51,971 --> 00:22:56,006
I don't ever wanna see
your face here again!

388
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:00,244
He's just getting
ready to clip the PDA.

389
00:23:00,346 --> 00:23:03,530
- Three-0 Vicryl.
- She's closing now.

390
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:06,450
No leaks, no bleeders,
no sepsis, BP's good.

391
00:23:06,552 --> 00:23:07,668
So we're home.

392
00:23:12,374 --> 00:23:14,085
- What's happening?
- The PDA ripped.

393
00:23:14,109 --> 00:23:16,143
Suction! Six-0 Prolene!
Now, damn it, now!

394
00:23:16,245 --> 00:23:20,363
What's happening?
What's going on, Robbins?

395
00:23:28,007 --> 00:23:30,874
- What happened?!
- I'm sorry.

396
00:23:30,976 --> 00:23:33,960
If she...

397
00:23:34,063 --> 00:23:35,862
I'm sorry.

398
00:23:44,272 --> 00:23:46,373
You need to be in here.

399
00:23:56,218 --> 00:23:58,352
You missed the good
part, Dr. Robbins.

400
00:23:58,454 --> 00:24:01,037
She tried to bleed out,
but I wouldn't let her.

401
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:04,308
And the lung is up.

402
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:06,410
And it is beautiful.

403
00:24:07,429 --> 00:24:10,547
All right. Five-0
Vicryl, please?

404
00:24:11,484 --> 00:24:15,268
And everybody's fine.

405
00:24:17,707 --> 00:24:21,775
- OK.
- Don't touch me!

406
00:24:21,878 --> 00:24:24,578
- She's been asking for you.
- Get in here!

407
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:28,415
This ham-fisted twit
doesn't know how to roll me.

408
00:24:28,517 --> 00:24:31,585
- You asked me not to come back.
- Just shut your hole
and get in here

409
00:24:31,687 --> 00:24:34,604
before this idiot
breaks my spine.

410
00:24:41,797 --> 00:24:43,113
One hundred grand.

411
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:47,000
- What?
- Alex! Don't.

412
00:24:47,102 --> 00:24:48,947
Give me a hundred
grand, and I'll come in.

413
00:24:48,971 --> 00:24:52,872
Mrs. Pulcher, he's joking.
He doesn't mean that.

414
00:24:52,975 --> 00:24:56,460
- Fifty.
- One hundred.

415
00:24:56,562 --> 00:25:00,998
- Seventy-five.
- One hundred grand. Final offer.

416
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:04,100
- You don't know
how to negotiate.
- I'm not negotiating.

417
00:25:04,203 --> 00:25:07,921
Don't pretend to be smart,
you crooked little bastard.

418
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,691
Don't pretend you're
poor, you evil old bitch.

419
00:25:11,577 --> 00:25:13,093
One hundred grand!

420
00:25:17,499 --> 00:25:20,017
Done. One hundred grand,

421
00:25:20,118 --> 00:25:23,487
and get in here
and roll me over.

422
00:25:25,073 --> 00:25:30,244
Wait. He made you pay
for parking, too? Smooth.

423
00:25:30,346 --> 00:25:33,079
Yeah, and that was
all before dinner.

424
00:25:33,182 --> 00:25:35,382
You gotta try this
pasta, it's ridiculous.

425
00:25:35,484 --> 00:25:37,317
I'm in.

426
00:25:38,971 --> 00:25:40,749
Did I tell you that his hair
was longer than mine?

427
00:25:40,773 --> 00:25:43,590
No. No...

428
00:25:43,692 --> 00:25:46,260
It's funny, I don't know why

429
00:25:46,362 --> 00:25:51,265
his online photo didn't feature
his very, very long ponytail.

430
00:25:51,367 --> 00:25:55,052
- I love this guy.
- Mm!

431
00:25:55,153 --> 00:25:57,187
- Mm!
- So good.

432
00:26:00,075 --> 00:26:03,343
- Meet us at Joe's. I'm buying.
- What's up?

433
00:26:03,445 --> 00:26:05,412
A hundred thousand
dollars is what's up,

434
00:26:05,514 --> 00:26:07,932
courtesy of the dragon
lady in room 1022.

435
00:26:08,034 --> 00:26:10,445
- Alex!
- You know what happens
when you break the rules, Mer?

436
00:26:10,469 --> 00:26:13,186
You get a hundred thousand
bucks. Drinks are on me.

437
00:26:13,288 --> 00:26:15,906
I can't, I'm on call.

438
00:26:16,008 --> 00:26:18,475
No. No, no!

439
00:26:21,463 --> 00:26:23,463
- No!
- Time of death, 21:44.

440
00:26:23,565 --> 00:26:25,615
- No! Shut up! No!
- She had an arrhythmia.

441
00:26:25,717 --> 00:26:28,185
- Get her back! I need her! I had it!
- Alex!

442
00:26:28,287 --> 00:26:29,648
- I had it! No!
- I'm sorry!

443
00:26:29,672 --> 00:26:31,705
I had it! I had it!

444
00:26:37,379 --> 00:26:39,062
You bitch.

445
00:26:42,584 --> 00:26:46,586
Mrs. Webber? What are
you doing here so late?

446
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:50,106
You know, Richard is
finishing up, and I'm just waiting.

447
00:26:50,208 --> 00:26:52,409
He doesn't like to
see me go home alone.

448
00:26:53,579 --> 00:26:54,859
May I sit with you?

449
00:26:55,815 --> 00:26:57,547
I'm surprised to see you here.

450
00:26:57,649 --> 00:27:00,150
- You're on call tonight?
- Mm-hm.

451
00:27:02,571 --> 00:27:06,706
- So how are you feeling?
- You really want
to ask me that?

452
00:27:06,808 --> 00:27:08,708
It's hard, I know.

453
00:27:08,828 --> 00:27:12,813
- You think so?
- I only know from my side of
it,

454
00:27:12,915 --> 00:27:16,032
- from my experience.
- Excuse me,

455
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:18,635
but I have no use
for your side of it.

456
00:27:18,737 --> 00:27:21,338
I thought I could
handle it, thought

457
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:25,208
I could live with it, it was only
temporary, that it was gonna go away.

458
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:30,280
But clearly I was wrong.
It's just getting worse.

459
00:27:31,217 --> 00:27:33,766
- I'm sorry.
- Are you?

460
00:27:33,868 --> 00:27:36,886
Are you really?

461
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:40,791
Then stop. Please, just stop.

462
00:27:40,893 --> 00:27:42,993
Are you in love with him?

463
00:27:43,095 --> 00:27:46,964
If you're in love with him, I don't
know what you should do, but I think...

464
00:27:47,066 --> 00:27:51,301
God help me, Ellis, I
think he's in love with you.

465
00:27:51,403 --> 00:27:54,321
And if you're not, please,

466
00:27:54,423 --> 00:27:57,023
give him back.

467
00:27:59,061 --> 00:28:01,027
Adele, it's Meredith.

468
00:28:01,129 --> 00:28:03,279
Not Ellis.

469
00:28:03,365 --> 00:28:06,466
It's Meredith. I'm her daughter.

470
00:28:06,568 --> 00:28:08,869
Ellis is gone. She died.

471
00:28:08,971 --> 00:28:12,005
Please give me back my husband.

472
00:28:13,659 --> 00:28:17,428
Please, give me back my husband.

473
00:28:18,931 --> 00:28:22,699
He's... He's yours.
He's all yours.

474
00:28:36,515 --> 00:28:39,549
Good morning!

475
00:28:41,387 --> 00:28:45,405
Oh, yeah! Look at you!

476
00:28:46,107 --> 00:28:49,309
Look at how big you are!

477
00:28:50,779 --> 00:28:53,680
Hey, I was just
coming to see you.

478
00:28:53,782 --> 00:28:57,817
Not you, her. Good
morning, beautiful.

479
00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:00,987
Are you gonna tell me to get
back in bed, 'cause I just got here.

480
00:29:01,089 --> 00:29:06,743
I am not. I was coming
to tell you to go home.

481
00:29:07,729 --> 00:29:10,514
- Don't drop that baby.
- To what? To what?

482
00:29:10,599 --> 00:29:12,949
- Go home.
- When?

483
00:29:13,051 --> 00:29:14,851
Now.

484
00:29:14,954 --> 00:29:18,038
Look, your vitals are
stable. Your balance is good,

485
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:23,009
and you obviously are strong
enough to carry this one around. So go.

486
00:29:23,111 --> 00:29:24,344
Get out!

487
00:29:27,883 --> 00:29:29,783
Did you hear that?

488
00:29:30,686 --> 00:29:33,086
We're going home.

489
00:29:35,724 --> 00:29:37,591
Wait.

490
00:29:38,427 --> 00:29:40,026
I'm going home.

491
00:29:41,597 --> 00:29:43,363
It's 500 bucks to
get it out of impound.

492
00:29:43,465 --> 00:29:45,882
- Come on!
- Should have paid the tickets.

493
00:29:45,984 --> 00:29:47,984
Have a nice day.

494
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:56,042
I will see you as
soon as you are done.

495
00:29:56,144 --> 00:29:58,996
Meredith, make him
stop fussing over me.

496
00:29:59,098 --> 00:30:00,396
I'll be right there.

497
00:30:03,852 --> 00:30:07,954
So she's going into surgery
right after the MRI, so don't worry.

498
00:30:09,391 --> 00:30:11,941
Meredith.

499
00:30:15,014 --> 00:30:17,442
- Thank you for everything
you've done.
- I didn't really do anything.

500
00:30:17,466 --> 00:30:21,968
- The circumstances changed.
- You did. You caught it first.

501
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:23,798
And the minute you
did, you looked after her,

502
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:27,807
you did everything you
could to take care of her.

503
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:31,544
I've made a lot of mistakes,
and it's taken me a lot of years

504
00:30:31,647 --> 00:30:34,931
to finally realize that all I
want to do is be with her.

505
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:39,519
You've given us the best
chance that we can get.

506
00:30:41,523 --> 00:30:44,190
You've done everything.

507
00:30:56,055 --> 00:30:58,939
- What's this?
- What's this? It's your kid.

508
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,768
- Your African kid.
- That's happening?

509
00:31:00,792 --> 00:31:02,103
- Today?
- Tonight!

510
00:31:02,127 --> 00:31:03,526
The first group
gets here tonight.

511
00:31:03,628 --> 00:31:04,956
I've been telling
you this all week!

512
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:07,096
Look, each of you
gets your own kid.

513
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:08,810
Some of them will be
traveling with family,

514
00:31:08,834 --> 00:31:12,669
a few of them are orphans, so
you are in charge of your kid, right?

515
00:31:12,771 --> 00:31:16,773
You're like their ambassador. Wait.
You can't have her. You'd be awful to her.

516
00:31:18,693 --> 00:31:21,178
Him. No. Yes, him.

517
00:31:22,581 --> 00:31:24,731
- He's melting down.
- Train wreck.

518
00:31:24,833 --> 00:31:27,467
Evil Spawn is now Mother Teresa.

519
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:30,753
Don't forget, they
get here tonight!

520
00:31:30,855 --> 00:31:34,691
Karev! They're here! They
just touched down in D.C.

521
00:31:34,793 --> 00:31:38,879
and they're gonna change planes
and have dinner and then they'll be here!

522
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:44,584
You did it! You know, I
never thought you would,

523
00:31:44,687 --> 00:31:47,521
I didn't think you
could, but you did.

524
00:31:47,623 --> 00:31:50,056
- Hm.
- Well done, Karev.

525
00:31:52,794 --> 00:31:54,027
See?

526
00:32:05,707 --> 00:32:08,007
I am in so much trouble.

527
00:32:08,109 --> 00:32:11,928
Oh, my... Oh, my God! How...

528
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:14,530
- How did you let this happen?
- It just happened.

529
00:32:14,633 --> 00:32:18,335
I asked for things, and
people started saying yes

530
00:32:18,437 --> 00:32:22,639
and I paid for it myself at first,
but then I maxed out my cards.

531
00:32:22,741 --> 00:32:25,342
But the ball was rolling
and planes were reserved

532
00:32:25,427 --> 00:32:28,895
and a freaking military transport!
What am I supposed to say?

533
00:32:29,014 --> 00:32:32,682
"Sorry! Never mind! Lack of funds!
Keep your dying kids where they are!"

534
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:34,500
- Well, yeah.
- No!

535
00:32:34,603 --> 00:32:36,447
You say, "I'll pay you
when you get here.

536
00:32:36,471 --> 00:32:38,899
Keep the receipts!
Send me the bill!"

537
00:32:38,923 --> 00:32:41,374
And now, I'm... Oh, God.

538
00:32:41,476 --> 00:32:44,878
Right now they're eating eight-dollar
airport hamburgers I can't pay for!

539
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:47,730
Alex, this... I
mean, this is fraud.

540
00:32:47,832 --> 00:32:50,967
- You've actually
grifted people!
- I can't do this.

541
00:32:51,069 --> 00:32:54,154
You have to now. I
mean, you already did it!

542
00:32:54,256 --> 00:32:57,357
You could go to
jail for th... this!

543
00:34:22,728 --> 00:34:26,062
Ah! There you are. Here's
your kid. They're coming tonight.

544
00:34:26,164 --> 00:34:28,798
- OK. Hold it for me.
- Just take it.

545
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:32,068
He's a five-year-old with optic
glioma. What are you doing?

546
00:34:33,155 --> 00:34:35,388
I'm working.

547
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:36,922
No. What are you doing?

548
00:34:37,025 --> 00:34:40,593
- Alex, this is from a lawyer.
- Ah!

549
00:34:51,222 --> 00:34:53,472
- No, take it!
- No, I don't wanna see it.

550
00:34:53,575 --> 00:34:56,960
Look, they're gonna get here tonight,
Lexie. They'll get their surgeries,

551
00:34:57,062 --> 00:34:59,462
I'll go to jail. I don't
even care anymore!

552
00:34:59,564 --> 00:35:02,282
No, no, don't! It's a check.

553
00:35:02,384 --> 00:35:05,552
It's a check for $200,000 from
the Estate of Gladys Pulcher.

554
00:35:05,654 --> 00:35:07,620
It's from the dragon lady.

555
00:35:14,812 --> 00:35:17,046
That bitch.

556
00:35:20,335 --> 00:35:24,137
OK, Adele, I need you to take a
couple deep breaths for me, OK?

557
00:35:28,726 --> 00:35:30,693
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine.

558
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:32,662
Good.

559
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:50,447
All right.

560
00:35:55,154 --> 00:35:58,788
OK, I'm gonna
make the injection.

561
00:36:00,292 --> 00:36:03,243
And you shouldn't feel this.

562
00:36:07,382 --> 00:36:09,115
There it is.

563
00:36:12,937 --> 00:36:14,804
Hi.

564
00:36:17,042 --> 00:36:21,360
I really don't want to go home
until she goes, you know?

565
00:36:21,462 --> 00:36:23,007
And clearly, she's
not ready to go,

566
00:36:23,031 --> 00:36:24,831
- so...
- Shh, shh!

567
00:36:24,933 --> 00:36:26,410
- She can go.
- What?

568
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:28,935
- What?
- - With most parents, I'd say no.

569
00:36:29,037 --> 00:36:32,588
But she has three doctors at home.
So if she passes the infant carrier test...

570
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:35,210
- What test?
- She has to sit
in an infant carrier

571
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:36,787
for an hour with no
apnea or bradycardia.

572
00:36:36,811 --> 00:36:39,712
She'll nail that.
I'll go get it.

573
00:36:41,549 --> 00:36:43,783
- Thank you.
- Oh. Yeah, it's OK.

574
00:36:43,885 --> 00:36:47,136
I mean, if she passes
the test, it's OK.

575
00:36:55,730 --> 00:36:57,647
People are talking about you.

576
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:01,217
Kindly. They're
saying you're kind.

577
00:37:01,319 --> 00:37:03,202
Funny. Compassionate.

578
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:06,639
And Dr. Robbins has a lot of
nice things to say about you.

579
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:09,976
I'm just glad, you know?

580
00:37:10,078 --> 00:37:11,678
I'm glad that people
are getting to know

581
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:15,431
the Robert that I
got to know, and like.

582
00:37:17,669 --> 00:37:19,986
You deserve for
people to like you.

583
00:37:24,426 --> 00:37:26,893
It's Dr. Stark.

584
00:37:45,797 --> 00:37:49,115
- How did it go?
- Actually,
it's still kind of going.

585
00:37:49,217 --> 00:37:52,468
- What? What do you mean?
- Well, it's this guy
that I met before

586
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:55,955
and now he's back in
town and it's kind of great.

587
00:37:57,809 --> 00:38:01,005
Oh, and they had that pasta
that you love, and I didn't want to...

588
00:38:01,029 --> 00:38:05,297
- So... here.
- You didn't have to... Thank you.

589
00:38:05,399 --> 00:38:07,217
Yeah.

590
00:38:07,319 --> 00:38:11,320
So... I'm sorry I can't stay.

591
00:38:11,422 --> 00:38:14,490
No, no, this is
great! You should go!

592
00:38:14,576 --> 00:38:15,853
- Yeah?
- Yeah, go.

593
00:38:15,877 --> 00:38:16,904
OK, all right. I'll call you.

594
00:38:16,928 --> 00:38:19,212
- All right.
- OK, good.

595
00:38:36,347 --> 00:38:38,381
- How's your friend?
- Good.

596
00:38:38,483 --> 00:38:40,483
Thanks. It was good
that we stopped.

597
00:38:40,569 --> 00:38:45,438
Glad to do it.
So... what's next?

598
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:47,106
Am I taking you home?

599
00:38:55,733 --> 00:38:58,635
Or I might be taking you home.

600
00:39:04,275 --> 00:39:06,054
<i>The length of your
recovery is determined</i>

601
00:39:06,078 --> 00:39:08,589
<i>- by the extent</i>
<i>of your injuries.</i>
- Five more seconds.

602
00:39:08,613 --> 00:39:13,816
Five, four, three, two, one!

603
00:39:13,918 --> 00:39:16,720
That's one hour.

604
00:39:17,539 --> 00:39:20,023
You did it, big girl!

605
00:39:21,175 --> 00:39:23,893
- I can't believe she's leaving.
- Yeah.

606
00:39:23,995 --> 00:39:25,645
Yeah, she's cute, isn't she?

607
00:39:26,898 --> 00:39:30,600
No, Callie. She was
my last cardio patient.

608
00:39:30,702 --> 00:39:34,053
- Does Teddy even talk about me?
- It's a cute baby, right?

609
00:39:34,155 --> 00:39:38,858
Its small features and oversized eyes
trigger a hormonal response in humans.

610
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,644
It's autonomic. It's what
keeps us from eating them.

611
00:39:43,598 --> 00:39:45,631
<i>And it's not always successful.</i>

612
00:39:45,733 --> 00:39:47,249
For the grad wall!

613
00:39:48,703 --> 00:39:50,769
- Yay!
- OK, let's roll.

614
00:39:50,872 --> 00:39:52,205
Wait, wait, wait, put her down.

615
00:39:52,307 --> 00:39:54,507
I have got the apnea
monitor, the O2.

616
00:39:54,609 --> 00:39:56,237
Callie, steal some of
those NICU blankets,

617
00:39:56,261 --> 00:39:59,194
- they're the best.
- OK, everybody stop! Stop, stop!

618
00:40:00,282 --> 00:40:02,898
<i>No matter how
hard we work at it...</i>

619
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,785
She's not ready.
No, she can't leave.

620
00:40:05,887 --> 00:40:07,698
She's been watched by
doctors 24 hours a day.

621
00:40:07,722 --> 00:40:10,367
- She still will.
- Well, her lungs. She could get RSV.

622
00:40:10,391 --> 00:40:12,119
- Any kid can get RSV.
- She's not getting in a car!

623
00:40:12,143 --> 00:40:15,127
- It's not safe!
- <i>Some wounds might</i>
<i>never fully heal.</i>

624
00:40:15,229 --> 00:40:17,030
- Callie.
- It's not safe!

625
00:40:17,148 --> 00:40:20,166
The last time she was in a car,
she nearly died! We both nearly died!

626
00:40:20,268 --> 00:40:24,503
Get her out of that thing! Give
her to me, Mark! I'm not kidding!

627
00:40:24,605 --> 00:40:25,922
Get her out of that thing!

628
00:40:26,708 --> 00:40:28,224
Callie. Callie.

629
00:40:28,326 --> 00:40:32,611
OK, OK. You're right,
you are absolutely right.

630
00:40:32,713 --> 00:40:34,446
Cars are not safe for children.

631
00:40:34,548 --> 00:40:38,317
Neither are
bookcases or squirrels

632
00:40:38,419 --> 00:40:40,953
or strong winds or
people who sneeze.

633
00:40:41,056 --> 00:40:43,890
They're all gonna get your baby.

634
00:40:44,008 --> 00:40:47,143
But honey, you don't feel this way
because you were in an accident.

635
00:40:47,245 --> 00:40:52,248
You feel this way
because you are a parent.

636
00:40:53,218 --> 00:40:55,518
Mm.

637
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:58,688
It'll pass, mostly.

638
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:01,224
Some of it never will.

639
00:41:02,944 --> 00:41:06,663
<i>You might have to adjust
to a whole new way of living.</i>

640
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:13,369
<i>Things may have
changed too radically...</i>

641
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:15,672
I wish I could tell him.

642
00:41:15,774 --> 00:41:18,574
- What?
- Richard.

643
00:41:18,677 --> 00:41:21,444
I wish I could tell him his
Adele got the medicine.

644
00:41:21,546 --> 00:41:22,945
I just hate keeping it from him.

645
00:41:23,047 --> 00:41:25,348
<i>To ever go back
to what they were.</i>

646
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:27,317
Me, too.

647
00:41:36,061 --> 00:41:38,027
I need a wheelchair.

648
00:41:38,863 --> 00:41:41,180
Lexie. Avery.

649
00:41:53,495 --> 00:41:56,663
<i>You might not even
recognize yourself.</i>

650
00:41:58,366 --> 00:42:01,701
<i>It's like you haven't
recovered anything at all.</i>

651
00:42:03,471 --> 00:42:06,055
<i>You're a whole new person...</i>

652
00:42:10,278 --> 00:42:12,711
<i>with a whole new life.</i>
