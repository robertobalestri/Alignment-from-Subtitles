00:00:13,497 --> 00:00:16,514
<i>The brain is the human

9
00:00:38,188 --> 00:00:40,371

15
00:00:53,337 --> 00:00:57,105

Dr. Sloan, are you
almost done here?

22
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:24,916
I'm good in two
seconds. What's up?

23
00:01:26,269 --> 00:01:27,736
Um, I... I'll wait.

24
00:01:27,838 --> 00:01:30,622
I rocked this mandibular repair.

25
00:01:30,724 --> 00:01:33,642
You'd never know this guy's
jaw was broken in five places.

26
00:01:33,743 --> 00:01:35,310
I'm somewhat of an artist.

27
00:01:35,412 --> 00:01:38,397
Not Picasso, because then
his jaw would be on his forehead.

28
00:01:38,499 --> 00:01:40,932
More like Chagall.

29
00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:43,202
Michelangelo.

30
00:01:43,304 --> 00:01:47,455
I'm Michelangelo. There.
Done. What've you got?

31
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:52,728
- What the hell happened?
- Car versus truck,
that's all we know.

32
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:55,247
And her injuries?
What...? The baby?

33
00:01:55,348 --> 00:01:57,577
- We don't know yet.
- Why the hell don't you know?

34
00:01:57,601 --> 00:02:00,301
- Someone get me a trauma gown.
- Mark, you need
to sit this one out.

35
00:02:00,403 --> 00:02:02,682
I'm not sitting this one out.
That's Callie. That's my kid!

36
00:02:02,706 --> 00:02:06,169
Which is why you can't. I'm sorry,
you can't be a doctor on this one.

37
00:02:06,193 --> 00:02:07,776
- Screw you.
- Sloan...

38
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:09,739
Screw all of you!

39
00:02:09,763 --> 00:02:12,881
Look at me, Sloan. Look at me.

40
00:02:12,983 --> 00:02:16,367
Look, maybe I don't understand
what you two have, how you have it,

41
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:19,320
but I understand this:
She is your family.

42
00:02:19,422 --> 00:02:22,073
Callie Torres and that
baby are your family.

43
00:02:22,175 --> 00:02:25,544
And the best way that you can
help your family is to step back

44
00:02:25,629 --> 00:02:28,964
and let the rest of us do
what you can't rationally do:

45
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:30,799
Save their lives.

46
00:02:31,385 --> 00:02:33,151
OK?

47
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:35,270
Mark.

48
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,006
- I'm in the room, you hear me?
- OK.

49
00:02:38,108 --> 00:02:40,275

50
00:02:42,646 --> 00:02:45,497

51
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,833
All right, everybody.
Multiple blunt trauma protocol.

52
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:50,096
- Let's go.
- Tachycardic
and hypotensive en route.

53
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,853
Obvious head and chest injuries.

54
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:54,155
Callie?

55
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:56,058
Callie, we've got
you, you hear me?

56
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,787
- Everything is gonna be OK.
- She's hemorrhaging.

57
00:02:57,811 --> 00:02:59,522
Wait, wait, hold on. Is that
blood coming from her chest?

58
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:01,379
Is it blood?

59
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:04,483
Calliope means... means music.

60
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:07,685
Honey, we're gonna fix you
up just fine. Don't you worry.

61
00:03:10,874 --> 00:03:12,352
She went through the windshield.

00:03:12,376 --> 00:03:14,154

- She's in SVT.

236
00:12:11,948 --> 00:12:14,298
I gave her adenosine
and some diltiazem, but...

237
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,551
Go. Take a break. I got it.

238
00:12:19,556 --> 00:12:22,323
Dr. Montgomery, there's a
chance the baby could survive

239
00:12:22,425 --> 00:12:24,486
if we deliver by C-section
while Callie is stable.

240
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:27,912
No, there's not, because not only
did you fail to stop her contractions,

241
00:12:28,014 --> 00:12:30,443
you didn't give steroids to the
baby to help mature her lungs.

242
00:12:30,467 --> 00:12:32,467
So you can go, too.

243
00:12:34,187 --> 00:12:36,037
Go!

244
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:42,142
Oh, sweetie...

245
00:12:42,245 --> 00:12:43,977
I'm so sorry.

246
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:48,933
But don't you worry. We got this.
The attendings, we're all gonna meet,

247
00:12:49,035 --> 00:12:50,651
and we are gonna
come up with a plan.

248
00:12:50,753 --> 00:12:54,171
I promise you, we're
gonna make a plan,

249
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:57,224
and we're gonna figure out
what to do. It's gonna be all right.

250
00:12:58,994 --> 00:13:01,028
You're gonna be OK.

251
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:05,483
She has got a hole in her heart. Needs
bypass to fix it, and she needs it now!

252
00:13:05,585 --> 00:13:08,346
- Bypass would mean
a lot of heparin.
- It is a setup for a rebleed.

253
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:10,549
- The hypothermia
would kill the baby.
- Traumatic VSDs

254
00:13:10,573 --> 00:13:12,351
- can close on their own.
- - Which is why we should wait

255
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:14,876
- to repair the heart.
- She's not stable enough
to wait.

- Damage control...
- This is Callie...

257
00:13:18,431 --> 00:13:19,859

rebleed is too great.

is supposed to feel like? Is this
what love feels like for other people?

376
00:19:50,706 --> 00:19:52,840
I don't really care about

Callie.

430
00:23:10,606 --> 00:23:14,775
I know it hurts, but we're
gonna lower your sedation

431
00:23:14,877 --> 00:23:17,661
and check on
your neuro function.

432
00:23:17,746 --> 00:23:19,591
Don't fight the intubation.
This won't take long.

433
00:23:19,615 --> 00:23:21,432
Can you follow
me with your eyes?

434
00:23:21,534 --> 00:23:22,933
With your eyes, OK?

435
00:23:24,269 --> 00:23:26,369
Can you squeeze my hand?

436
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:33,043
What about one finger?
Can you move one finger?

437
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,530
I'm gonna put her under.

438
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:43,570
- It's too soon
to tell anything.
- She didn't respond?

439
00:23:44,556 --> 00:23:46,874
She opened her eyes, and...

440
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:53,113
- Look, it's just
too soon to tell.
- Derek, she follow commands?

441
00:23:53,215 --> 00:23:55,232
Anything else?

442
00:23:59,404 --> 00:24:01,471
No. Nothing else.

443
00:24:03,342 --> 00:24:07,410
These are Dr. Burke's ex-patients.
Both stab wounds to the chest.

444
00:24:07,513 --> 00:24:11,214
Both presented after their
initial surgeries with DOE.

445
00:24:11,316 --> 00:24:14,618
He fixed both of them percutaneously,
which drastically reduces the amount

446
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,204
of heparin needed, so we
could avoid the brain rebleeding,

447
00:24:17,306 --> 00:24:19,968
and we don't need hypothermia so
the baby would have a better chance...

448
00:24:19,992 --> 00:24:23,277
Callie has a cardiac contusion, not
penetrating trauma. This is different.

449
00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:25,412
But I read cases where
it worked in blunt trauma.

450
00:24:25,514 --> 00:24:28,760
Well, I have seen every cardiac
structure sheered off by the wire

451
00:24:28,784 --> 00:24:31,902
- in the loop in that procedure.
- Dr. Burke uses a technique

452
00:24:32,004 --> 00:24:34,082
that doesn't require
the formation of a loop.

453
00:24:34,106 --> 00:24:37,374
By placing an extra stiff wire
deep into the pulmonary artery,

454
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:39,754
- we avoided that complication.
- Even if that's the case,

455
00:24:39,778 --> 00:24:42,340
- there's embolization
and hemolysis...
- Which all could be avoided

456
00:24:42,364 --> 00:24:45,649
with a meticulous delivery
technique. It's genius!

457
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:52,690
No.

458
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:54,853
- What?
- I'm saying no.

459
00:24:54,877 --> 00:24:56,157
It's too risky in this case.

460
00:24:56,261 --> 00:24:58,345
The chances that we
could puncture her heart

461
00:24:58,447 --> 00:25:00,631
- are too high.
- I did the surgery with Burke!

462
00:25:00,732 --> 00:25:02,911
He taught me. If you're
unfamiliar with the technique,

463
00:25:02,935 --> 00:25:05,603
I can show you
operative reports.

464
00:25:06,722 --> 00:25:08,255
This discussion is over.

465
00:25:12,361 --> 00:25:14,128
- Owen?
- I am head of Cardio,

466
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:16,914
- not your husband.
- I am not asking my husband.

467
00:25:17,016 --> 00:25:20,968
I'm asking the person in
charge of Callie's case. Dr. Hunt?

468
00:25:23,622 --> 00:25:28,175
I'm sorry, but... If Dr. Altman
says that it's too risky...

469
00:25:28,277 --> 00:25:29,876
Cristina!

470
00:25:32,415 --> 00:25:34,448
Mark's kind of right, you know?

471
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:37,033
I'm... nothing.

472
00:25:37,135 --> 00:25:40,136
I mean, legally, I'm... no one.

473
00:25:40,238 --> 00:25:45,359
Which is kinda crazy,
'cause I feel like your wife.

474
00:25:46,478 --> 00:25:49,213
I feel like our baby's mom.

475
00:25:53,019 --> 00:25:55,619
Can you just...?

476
00:25:55,721 --> 00:25:57,654
Can you live?

477
00:25:58,624 --> 00:26:01,625

478
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:05,495

Dr. Altman, we can still
do the percutaneous repair.

542

made.

Get me more lap pads, I got
a lot of bleeding down here.

545
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:02,235
Yang is right. We need to reverse the
heparin and try the percutaneous repair.

546
00:32:02,338 --> 00:32:04,971

fighting against all
the complications.

665
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:55,965
She's got beautiful black
hair, Calliope. Beautiful hair.

666
00:38:56,067 --> 00:38:58,084
She's... She's beautiful.

667
00:39:01,722 --> 00:39:04,541
She can't open her eyes yet.

668
00:39:04,643 --> 00:39:09,612
But I can tell, she's
looking for you.

669
00:39:09,715 --> 00:39:14,450
OK? She's asking for you.

670
00:40:34,666 --> 00:40:37,099
- You sleeping at home tonight?
- Look.

671
00:40:38,737 --> 00:40:41,471
I am not the kind of guy
that waits around for the girl

672
00:40:41,573 --> 00:40:44,406
who's still in love with
someone else. I'm just not.

673
00:40:44,509 --> 00:40:45,925
Jackson.

674
00:40:48,329 --> 00:40:50,296
Let's go home.

675
00:40:53,968 --> 00:40:57,403
And let's put her on a low
dose of dopamine. Dr. Altman.

676
00:40:58,155 --> 00:40:59,589
Um, is there...?

677
00:41:00,825 --> 00:41:01,935
Did you have anything
you wanted to add?

678
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:05,144
- I can't teach you anymore.
- What?

679
00:41:05,246 --> 00:41:08,598
If you refuse to learn,
if you won't listen,

680
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:11,100
- I can't teach you.
- I'm sorry...

681
00:41:11,202 --> 00:41:13,169
Find someone else to learn from.

682
00:42:52,086 --> 00:42:54,220
Yes...

683
00:42:57,225 --> 00:43:00,192
Yes...

684
00:43:00,294 --> 00:43:03,562
Oh, my God. Oh, my God! Callie?

685
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:05,731
- Yes.
- Callie?

686
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:09,185
- Yes.
- What? What?

687
00:43:12,290 --> 00:43:14,407
I'll marry you.

688
00:43:15,309 --> 00:43:17,693
Yes. Yes.
