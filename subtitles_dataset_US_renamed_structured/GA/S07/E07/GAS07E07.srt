1
00:00:04,822 --> 00:00:05,970
<i>Question:</i>

2
00:00:06,073 --> 00:00:08,113
<i>when was the last
time a complete stranger</i>

3
00:00:08,175 --> 00:00:10,509
<i>took off her clothes
in front of you,</i>

4
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:13,945
<i>pointed to a big purple
splotch on her back and asked,</i>

5
00:00:14,048 --> 00:00:17,549
<i>- "What the hell</i>
<i>is this thing?"</i>
<i>- </i> OK. How about it, Mark?

6
00:00:17,651 --> 00:00:19,852
You know you've always
wanted one of... these.

7
00:00:19,953 --> 00:00:24,923
<i>If you're a normal person,
the answer is, hopefully, never.</i>

8
00:00:25,026 --> 00:00:28,460
<i>If you're a doctor, the
answer is probably,</i>

9
00:00:28,545 --> 00:00:32,697
<i>- "About five minutes ago."</i>
- Nah, I'm good.

10
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:35,433
- I will take that waffle iron.
- What?

11
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:36,796
I have never seen
you eat a waffle.

12
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:39,020
I would if I had a waffle iron.

13
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:42,508
Callie, we're not gonna
take a waffle iron to Malawi,

14
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:44,871
and it's not gonna do anybody any
good sitting in storage for three years.

15
00:00:44,895 --> 00:00:47,996
<i>People expect doctors
to have all of the answers.</i>

16
00:00:48,098 --> 00:00:51,166
Congratulations. You won
yourself a waffle iron. Oh!

17
00:00:51,268 --> 00:00:56,872
- And a French press.
- Hey. Stop giving
my things away.

18
00:01:02,662 --> 00:01:04,429
Maybe I should pass
on the French press.

19
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:05,847
<i>The truth is</i>

20
00:01:05,949 --> 00:01:09,067
<i>we love to think that we
have all of the answers, too.</i>

21
00:01:09,169 --> 00:01:12,248
So The Art & Lesley Phillips Foundation
has a few more hoops to jump through

22
00:01:12,272 --> 00:01:15,118
than the others, but their primary
focus is Alzheimer's research.

23
00:01:15,142 --> 00:01:18,254
And if you get this grant, it is
more than enough to get us started.

24
00:01:18,278 --> 00:01:20,223
- You really did your homework.
- I'm a great student.

25
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:23,207
Just the kind you want around
when doing a clinical trial.

26
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,937
- How's that going?
- It's fine.

27
00:01:29,039 --> 00:01:31,599
Is this because Richard gave
Hunt the million dollars and not me?

28
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:33,069
Is that why things are
frosty between you two?

29
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:34,738
We're not frosty. We're fine.

30
00:01:34,762 --> 00:01:36,239
But if you're
looking for solidarity,

31
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:39,097
I would be more than
happy to skip Owen Hunt's

32
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:40,226
trauma certification lab.

33
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:42,450
- Go get certified.
- OK.

34
00:01:42,553 --> 00:01:45,803
<i>Basically, doctors
are know-it-alls.</i>

35
00:01:45,905 --> 00:01:49,207
<i>Until something comes along
that reminds us we're not.</i>

36
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:51,777
I need someone to help
me set up the trauma lab,

37
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:54,640
to keep things running smoothly.
You'd get your certification that way.

38
00:01:54,664 --> 00:01:57,048
- And it's a pretty easy day.
- It's a skills lab.

39
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:59,451
- It's already an easy day.
- Dr. Hunt.

40
00:01:59,553 --> 00:02:03,839
- I'm going to need
to borrow Dr. Yang.
- Oh. Uh, what's up?

41
00:02:03,941 --> 00:02:06,141
Lungs have become
available for Roy Henley.

42
00:02:06,243 --> 00:02:08,455
And since he found
himself on the transplant list

43
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,007
based on Dr. Yang's
recommendation, I would say

44
00:02:11,031 --> 00:02:14,349
- that would make
him her patient.
- OK, what do you need me to do?

45
00:02:14,451 --> 00:02:17,163
I just need someone to monitor
him while I go pick up the lungs.

46
00:02:17,187 --> 00:02:20,088
- So I'll be on my own?
- Nope. Dr. McQueen,
cardio fellow,

47
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:22,018
he will be around on the off
chance that you need anything.

48
00:02:22,042 --> 00:02:26,311
Oh, and I finally was able to get
Roy's daughter to agree to come in,

49
00:02:26,413 --> 00:02:30,398
- so just keep
an eye out for her, OK?
- OK.

50
00:02:31,952 --> 00:02:34,869
You'll be fine.
Still an easy day.

51
00:02:34,971 --> 00:02:37,523
I know.

52
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:43,078
Am I early? I tried
really hard not to be.

53
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:45,642
- That doesn't bode well.
- We did the
same thing with Bailey

54
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:49,300
when we were interns.
Take turns treating a dummy,

55
00:02:49,403 --> 00:02:52,070
get an early lunch, then
get back to work. It's lame.

56
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,066
A charter plane was forced
into an emergency landing,

57
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:58,509
and collided with a Greyhound
bus. Mass casualty situation.

58
00:02:58,611 --> 00:03:01,329
Do we need to say
it again? Let's move!

59
00:03:01,432 --> 00:03:04,265
Close to 30 victims in
the field, some critical,

60
00:03:04,367 --> 00:03:06,735
multiple blunt trauma injuries.

61
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:14,643
I was so looking
forward to an early lunch.

62
00:03:18,649 --> 00:03:20,949
This is gonna suck.

63
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:24,269
You're kidding me, right?

64
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:28,991
Welcome to trauma certification.
You will work in teams of four.

65
00:03:29,093 --> 00:03:31,727
Each team will be
responsible for nine casualties.

66
00:03:31,829 --> 00:03:35,463
You may treat your patients using only
what you can carry with your two hands

67
00:03:35,565 --> 00:03:38,266
from this ambulance. The
evac helicopter is on its way.

68
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:43,589
You get your patients on the helicopter,
you get certified. Are you ready?

69
00:03:43,691 --> 00:03:46,090
Get to work.

70
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:53,114
- Dr. Grey?
- Uh, Christy Cornell, age 28,

71
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:56,852
she's here for a gluteoplasty?

72
00:03:56,954 --> 00:03:59,420
She's so tiny. There's
hardly anything there to lift.

73
00:03:59,523 --> 00:04:02,074
That's sort of the
point, Dr. Grey.

74
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:04,643
I'm... I'm sorry. That was...

75
00:04:04,728 --> 00:04:06,072
- Oh!
- I'm sorry.

76
00:04:06,096 --> 00:04:07,573
Christy's not here for a lift.

77
00:04:07,597 --> 00:04:10,565
She's here for
a gluteal implant.

78
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:13,101
Yes. I'm finally gonna get
some junk up in this trunk.

79
00:04:13,203 --> 00:04:16,821
This program shows a rendering of what
you can expect the gluteus to look like

80
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:19,040
after the implant.

81
00:04:19,743 --> 00:04:22,911
Oh... Um...

82
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:25,881
Could I see what it'd look
like kicked up a couple points?

83
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:27,949
Sure.

84
00:04:28,051 --> 00:04:31,519
Mm... Couple more?

85
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,739
Couple more.

86
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:38,644
Stop. That's it.

87
00:04:39,546 --> 00:04:40,711
That's my ass.

88
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,968
Come on, that was funny.

89
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:49,754
Any joke that starts with
an animal walking into a bar

90
00:04:49,856 --> 00:04:51,690
is scientifically unfunny.

91
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:56,678
Humor me, Dr. Yang. I
need something to focus on.

92
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:59,692
I don't know if I'm more
nervous about getting new lungs

93
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:02,196
or about actually
seeing my daughter.

94
00:05:02,285 --> 00:05:04,318
Don't think about it
as getting new lungs.

95
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:07,472
Think of it as getting
rid of old, crappy lungs.

96
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:14,228
Or don't think at all. OK,
Roy, take some deep breaths.

97
00:05:15,265 --> 00:05:18,900
- Corinne?
- Roy.

98
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:22,354
- How ya been?
- This week,

99
00:05:22,456 --> 00:05:24,289
or for the past 20 years?

100
00:05:25,608 --> 00:05:27,893
I'm sorry. That was snarky.

101
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:30,428
No, snarky's good.

102
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:33,615
I like snarky. You
get that from me.

103
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:42,374
Roy? Roy!

104
00:05:42,476 --> 00:05:43,375
Get the crash cart!

105
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:46,294
- He's not breathing!
- V-fib!

106
00:05:46,963 --> 00:05:48,714
Page cardio.

107
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:53,985
Aren't you the
doctor? Do something!

108
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:01,910
Um... What's happening?

109
00:06:02,012 --> 00:06:06,248
Your father's developed cor
pulmonale and his heart is overloading.

110
00:06:06,349 --> 00:06:09,885
What? I-I don't understand. I
thought his lungs were the problem.

111
00:06:09,987 --> 00:06:13,454
His lungs are putting
extra pressure on his heart.

112
00:06:13,556 --> 00:06:15,852
Dr. Altman is picking up
the new lungs right now.

113
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:17,687
I'll call her and apprise
her of the situation.

114
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:19,694
What situation?
What is going on?

115
00:06:19,813 --> 00:06:24,115
His heart is failing. And the
damage seems pretty severe.

116
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:28,686
So... uh, there's a possibility

117
00:06:28,789 --> 00:06:31,939
- he'll need a new one.
- A new what?

118
00:06:32,042 --> 00:06:34,125
A new heart?

119
00:06:38,281 --> 00:06:41,883
You know what? Take over
here. I'm going to call Dr. Altman

120
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:44,719
and I'm gonna get McQueen.

121
00:06:45,855 --> 00:06:48,089
Dr. Bailey, do you
have a second?

122
00:06:48,192 --> 00:06:50,170
Only if what you have to
talk about is more important

123
00:06:50,194 --> 00:06:52,722
- than my being
on time for an autopsy.
- It's arguable.

124
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:55,186
We're throwing Torres and
Robbins a bon voyage party

125
00:06:55,232 --> 00:06:57,776
- in the doctors'
lounge this evening.
- That sounds lovely.

126
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,700
Uh, I have a full day,
but I'll try and stop by.

127
00:06:59,802 --> 00:07:03,004
Well, the thing is, Altman
volunteered, uh, to pick up the cupcakes,

128
00:07:03,106 --> 00:07:05,807
but she had to pick up lungs
instead. And I just figured,

129
00:07:05,909 --> 00:07:07,792
since you're close
to both these ladies...

130
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:11,279
You're asking me to take
time out of my very busy day

131
00:07:11,381 --> 00:07:16,584
to go to the bakery? Or would you prefer
I ran on home and baked some myself?

132
00:07:18,304 --> 00:07:20,338
No. 'Course not.

133
00:07:20,423 --> 00:07:23,558
- Just an invitation.
- Uh-huh.

134
00:07:25,062 --> 00:07:28,997
Mark, I need to talk to you
about Christy Cornell's...

135
00:07:29,099 --> 00:07:31,933
- butt.
- OK.

136
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:35,287
But first I need to talk
to you about cupcakes.

137
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:40,737
Callie! Check out all of the great
stuff the kids in Peds made me.

138
00:07:40,761 --> 00:07:42,939
They want me to take
pictures of their crafts in Africa.

139
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:44,612
Wow! That's awesome.

140
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:47,193
You'd be surprised how often you
find yourself in need of a macaroni face

141
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:52,186
glued to a paper plate. It's way better
than gauze, malaria pills, antibiotics.

142
00:07:52,289 --> 00:07:55,757
You are a delight this morning. Is
there something you'd like to talk about?

143
00:07:55,859 --> 00:07:58,626
Um, no. No, I'm just...

144
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:01,913
No.

145
00:08:03,283 --> 00:08:05,951
- Ah! Torres. Robbins.
- Hi.

146
00:08:06,053 --> 00:08:08,253
I thought you'd be
halfway to Malawi by now.

147
00:08:08,355 --> 00:08:09,966
We had some
last-minute paperwork.

148
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,374
Plus, I promised the kids
I'd come say goodbye.

149
00:08:12,476 --> 00:08:15,210
That's good. The work
you two will be doing there

150
00:08:15,311 --> 00:08:19,180
will reflect very, very
highly on this hospital.

151
00:08:19,282 --> 00:08:23,051
Sure, uh, it was
a surprise to learn

152
00:08:23,153 --> 00:08:27,288
that I'd have to replace
two excellent attendings,

153
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:28,957
as opposed to just the one.

154
00:08:29,059 --> 00:08:31,437
But then, that's
the chief's problem.

155
00:08:31,461 --> 00:08:35,747
No one wants to really
hear chief's problems.

156
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:38,449
It's a shame, though, Torres.

157
00:08:38,552 --> 00:08:42,754
I had, uh... I had
such big plans for you.

158
00:08:44,224 --> 00:08:46,041
Big plans.

159
00:08:50,063 --> 00:08:53,498
Can I get suction? Thank you.

160
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,767
Clamp please.

161
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:59,737
Dr. McQueen, I really need
you to take a look at Roy Henley.

162
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,835
They tell me he's developed cor
pulmonale and circulatory collapse.

163
00:09:02,859 --> 00:09:06,578
- Yes, sir, that's correct.
- Did you put him on dopamine,
milrinone and nitric oxide?

164
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,931
Yes, I did. He's stable.
Critical, but stable.

165
00:09:10,033 --> 00:09:12,667
What would you do for a patient
with reduced cardiac output,

166
00:09:12,769 --> 00:09:16,271
hypotension, sinus tach
and metabolic acidosis?

167
00:09:16,373 --> 00:09:19,557
I'd insert an intraaortic
balloon pump.

168
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:22,743
Exactly.

169
00:09:22,845 --> 00:09:24,623
I'll be there when
I can, Dr. Yang.

170
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:27,315
But it really doesn't sound
like you need me at all.

171
00:09:28,284 --> 00:09:30,384
Permeate the suction.

172
00:09:59,782 --> 00:10:03,418
You must be Dr. Bailey. I'm
Dr. Stanley, head of pathology.

173
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,537
And this must be
Mary Portman, 30.

174
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,007
Multiple organ failure,
cause unknown.

175
00:10:09,092 --> 00:10:12,427
She came in for a standard
colostomy reversal and never woke up.

176
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:17,215
Well, all right. Looks like we've got
something we can sink our teeth into.

177
00:10:18,301 --> 00:10:21,486
Um, I have a list
of possible causes

178
00:10:21,588 --> 00:10:24,656
I'd like to check as we proceed.

179
00:10:24,758 --> 00:10:26,769
We have a specific order to
the way we work down here,

180
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:30,295
so we'll see what we see
when we see it. OK? OK.

181
00:10:31,681 --> 00:10:34,449
According to this card, this
guy's got a blown right pupil,

182
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:39,954
an atlanto-occipital dislocation, open
book pelvis, large open abdominal wound,

183
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:43,041
jeez... a sucking chest
wound with seven broken ribs...

184
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:47,328
- This guy is all messed up.
- Or he's dead.

185
00:10:47,431 --> 00:10:51,466
Ah! Right. Yes. Moving on.

186
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:09,734
Cristina? Hey, how
long you been here?

187
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:12,553
Oh... Not long. I just
needed some fresh air.

188
00:11:12,655 --> 00:11:15,573
- How's the patient?
- He's fine. He's great.

189
00:11:15,676 --> 00:11:19,227
Uh, couple complications,
but... I'm handling it.

190
00:11:19,329 --> 00:11:21,729
- Are you sure that you're OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

191
00:11:21,832 --> 00:11:24,132
It's, uh... chilly out here.

192
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:29,938
That's him. Um...

193
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:32,573
I need to... I...

194
00:11:32,675 --> 00:11:35,176
- have to go look.
- OK. All right.

195
00:11:36,546 --> 00:11:38,812
- Cristina.
- Uh-huh?

196
00:11:38,914 --> 00:11:41,165
You can do this.

197
00:11:42,169 --> 00:11:44,335
OK. Thanks.

198
00:11:49,942 --> 00:11:54,845
Grey! Congratulations.
You're, uh... You're certified.

199
00:11:54,948 --> 00:11:57,782
Now, you go inside
and give Cristina a hand.

200
00:11:57,884 --> 00:11:59,533
What does she need?
Did she ask for me?

201
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:02,920
Meredith, please.

202
00:12:04,441 --> 00:12:06,240
OK, thanks.

203
00:12:19,172 --> 00:12:20,972
- Hey.
- What're you doing here?

204
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:24,042
- Owen sent me.
- I don't need a baby-sitter.

205
00:12:24,144 --> 00:12:26,560
I'm just an extra set of
hands. What's the situation?

206
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:30,815
He went into cardiogenic shock, so
I'm inserting an intraaortic balloon pump

207
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:34,597
and hoping there are no other
complications before Teddy gets back.

208
00:12:34,637 --> 00:12:38,222
So we are watching for
hemolysis, a gas embolism,

209
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:40,041
a blue leg from
peripheral ischemia.

210
00:12:40,143 --> 00:12:41,553
OK, if you want to do something,

211
00:12:41,577 --> 00:12:45,212
his daughter is up in CCU
and she needs an update.

212
00:12:47,634 --> 00:12:49,267
OK.

213
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,607
Blue Team. Status report.

214
00:12:55,709 --> 00:12:57,620
We arrived on the scene
to find nine casualties.

215
00:12:57,644 --> 00:13:01,279
We identified three as priority
one, requiring immediate evacuation.

216
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:04,315
Four were priority two,
allowing for delayed evac.

217
00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:08,987
One was priority three and the
last was, sadly, dead on the scene.

218
00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:13,491
Nice work, Kepner, but it seems to
me that you now have two dead patients.

219
00:13:13,593 --> 00:13:15,460
- Excuse me?
- While you were standing around

220
00:13:15,562 --> 00:13:18,329
waiting for the helicopter to arrive
and not keeping a constant eye

221
00:13:18,431 --> 00:13:22,183
on your patients' injuries, this
one developed a femoral bleed,

222
00:13:22,285 --> 00:13:25,520
bled out and is
now, sadly, dead.

223
00:13:25,622 --> 00:13:27,999
Uh... A femoral bleed?
That wasn't on the card.

224
00:13:28,023 --> 00:13:29,924
Really? Well, it's on this one.

225
00:13:30,026 --> 00:13:34,862
- No, wait, that's not fair!
- - Patients don't suddenly die.

226
00:13:34,964 --> 00:13:37,084
It just seems that way when
you stop paying attention.

227
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:40,518
Food for thought. Red Team, go.

228
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:43,154
I'm so sorry, you guys.

229
00:13:47,343 --> 00:13:49,027
Awesome.

230
00:13:49,129 --> 00:13:53,397
Tell me about the
bandaging on these two...

231
00:13:56,970 --> 00:14:00,054
Right. The reservation's
under Stanley. Jennifer Stanley.

232
00:14:00,156 --> 00:14:03,591
Four people, for 8:00.

233
00:14:03,693 --> 00:14:05,376
Well, that doesn't
make any sense.

234
00:14:05,478 --> 00:14:09,313
Why would eight people
want to have dinner at 4:00?

235
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:15,086
Dr. Stanley, the clots could
indicate a pulmonary embolus.

236
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:16,948
- Let me talk to your manager.
- Dr. Stanley?

237
00:14:16,972 --> 00:14:20,124
- What's up?
- I was asking
about those blood clots.

238
00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:23,961
Couldn't a pulmonary
embolus have led to her death?

239
00:14:24,064 --> 00:14:26,681
Those are post-mortem clots,
Dr. Bailey. Perfectly normal.

240
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:30,234
Hello? Hi, yes. There's been a
mistake with my dinner reservation.

241
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:33,654
Big plans.

242
00:14:33,756 --> 00:14:35,672
Big plans.

243
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:38,409
You know what? I don't
care. I've got big plans, myself.

244
00:14:38,511 --> 00:14:41,211
- Great big African plans.
- Yeah, you do.

245
00:14:41,313 --> 00:14:44,898
Yeah, I don't need to grow cartilage
in a lab, I'll be building bones from dirt.

246
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,070
I'll be figuring out how to
create unbreakable joints

247
00:14:49,172 --> 00:14:54,792
out of blood diamonds. I'll be making
artificial limbs out of elephant ivory.

248
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:57,506
I'm pretty sure a couple of those would
be frowned upon by the world community.

249
00:14:57,530 --> 00:15:00,330
Whatever. Science isn't
about making friends.

250
00:15:01,951 --> 00:15:05,319
The helicopter has to be getting
here soon. It's been three hours.

251
00:15:05,421 --> 00:15:08,722
Just a few more minutes.
Right? Right, Dr. Hunt?

252
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:11,186
The helicopter will
be here any minute?

253
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:13,994
Nice rain gear, Karev.
Shouldn't you be more concerned

254
00:15:14,096 --> 00:15:16,430
- with your patient staying dry?
- Yeah, well, he's a dummy

255
00:15:16,533 --> 00:15:21,602
- and I'm a person, so...
- A dry patient
is less likely to die

256
00:15:21,704 --> 00:15:26,106
of hypothermia or shock.
Something to think about.

257
00:15:26,209 --> 00:15:28,476
Alex, you can't break
the rules like that.

258
00:15:28,578 --> 00:15:30,411
That's unsanctioned
use of a trash bag!

259
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:31,874
You're gonna mess
up our certification.

260
00:15:31,898 --> 00:15:34,031
You need to relax.
This whole uptight thing?

261
00:15:34,134 --> 00:15:35,994
- This is why you
have no friends.
- Hey.

262
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:39,237
OK, this is why
you have one friend.

263
00:15:40,807 --> 00:15:43,574
Give me that back!
Are you crazy?

264
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:47,611
There you go, little guy.
No hypothermia for you.

265
00:15:50,183 --> 00:15:52,850
Everyone, Green Team's
patients are all dead.

266
00:15:52,935 --> 00:15:56,270
Only Red Team and
Blue Team remain.

267
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:58,639
Whoa! Do you see a helicopter?

268
00:15:58,742 --> 00:16:02,410
- Take a knee
and learn something.
- Take a knee?

269
00:16:03,646 --> 00:16:05,496
He's gonna scalp them.

270
00:16:05,598 --> 00:16:07,765
We're in<i> Apocalypse Now</i>
and we're gonna get scalped.

271
00:16:07,867 --> 00:16:10,651
That, right there.
See what she's doing?

272
00:16:13,489 --> 00:16:16,607
OK, I swear I'm not an idiot.

273
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:19,243
If Dr. Altman doesn't
get this new heart,

274
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:22,479
is that, like, game over
on the lung transplant?

275
00:16:22,581 --> 00:16:25,727
Uh, there are a variety of
factors. Right now, I'm not sure.

276
00:16:25,751 --> 00:16:29,220
- But I can get
an answer for you.
- Fine. Uh...

277
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:31,689
Where are we on the heart?

278
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:35,442
Again, not sure. Dr. Altman should
be calling with an update very soon.

279
00:16:35,544 --> 00:16:39,746
- OK. Uh, when can I see him?
- I have to check with Dr. Yang.

280
00:16:39,848 --> 00:16:42,799
You're just like a wealth
of information, aren't you?

281
00:16:42,902 --> 00:16:45,453
I'm sorry, I'm new to your
father's case, and Dr. Yang...

282
00:16:45,555 --> 00:16:49,924
I called him Roy. I decided
to do that on the drive over.

283
00:16:50,026 --> 00:16:53,193
'Cause I hadn't
seen him in 20 years.

284
00:16:53,296 --> 00:16:56,964
And I want to
blame him for that.

285
00:16:57,066 --> 00:16:59,733
I do blame him for that,

286
00:16:59,835 --> 00:17:04,171
except... he tried.

287
00:17:05,508 --> 00:17:09,009
He tried to be my
dad in the beginning,

288
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:13,447
and I couldn't forgive
him for leaving my mom.

289
00:17:15,317 --> 00:17:17,485
And then he stopped trying.

290
00:17:17,587 --> 00:17:21,956
And... I have
twins. They're three.

291
00:17:22,058 --> 00:17:25,659
And I don't even know if he
knows that. I never told him.

292
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:30,181
And then... then
I walked in there

293
00:17:30,283 --> 00:17:33,117
and I called him Roy.

294
00:17:35,021 --> 00:17:37,622
I called my dad Roy.

295
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:40,524
And I just... I need for that

296
00:17:40,626 --> 00:17:43,393
to not be the last
thing he hears from me.

297
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:45,846
Please.

298
00:17:49,385 --> 00:17:50,985
The daughter really
needs to talk to you.

299
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,764
She has too many
questions that I can't answer.

300
00:17:52,788 --> 00:17:55,468
- Why don't you try
reading his chart.
- Cristina, if you wanna be

301
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:58,103
- pissed at me, that's fine.
- We're not gonna
do this right now.

302
00:17:58,127 --> 00:18:02,379
- 'Cause I'm kinda busy here.
- Crap.

303
00:18:08,154 --> 00:18:11,705
All right, get him on ECMO.
That should keep him alive

304
00:18:11,807 --> 00:18:14,875
until I can get back with
these lungs. There's a shot that

305
00:18:14,977 --> 00:18:17,528
<i>once we get them in, the
heart damage will reverse</i>

306
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:19,741
- without the excess pressure.
- Teddy says get him on ECMO.

307
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:22,294
- What does it look
like I'm doing?
- OK, apparently,

308
00:18:22,318 --> 00:18:23,551
Cristina's on it.

309
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:28,855
- Grey, how's she doing?
- She is doing great.

310
00:18:28,957 --> 00:18:32,025
- She's doing great.
<i>- Good. Good.</i>

311
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:38,716
Intestines show a well
healed anastomosis

312
00:18:38,818 --> 00:18:44,338
with no evidence of infection,
inflammation or necrosis.

313
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:48,325
I think this is as good a place as
any to call lunch. What do you say?

314
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:52,563
Lunch? We have to check the
adrenal glands and the kidneys.

315
00:18:52,665 --> 00:18:54,492
What if the thyroid
shows pathology?

316
00:18:54,516 --> 00:18:55,982
Don't worry, those
kidneys aren't

317
00:18:56,085 --> 00:18:59,286
- going anywhere on their own.
- Yes, I'm aware.

318
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:03,874
But microscopic pathological
changes are harder to interpret

319
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:06,336
once the organs
start decomposing.

320
00:19:06,379 --> 00:19:09,513
We'll only be gone 45
minutes. They'll keep.

321
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:11,160
Still, I don't
think it's right...

322
00:19:11,184 --> 00:19:13,434
Dr. Bailey, I'll see
you in 45 minutes.

323
00:19:15,805 --> 00:19:18,450
I don't know, they're
chocolaty-looking with sprinkles.

324
00:19:18,474 --> 00:19:20,785
- Where'd you get them?
- That grocery store
down the street.

325
00:19:20,809 --> 00:19:24,878
This isn't a baby shower for some nurse
who couldn't keep her knees together.

326
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:27,381
Torres and Robbins deserve
better than off-brand crap.

327
00:19:27,483 --> 00:19:30,596
I'm not an errand girl. I'm a
doctor with a patient who is about

328
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:32,847
- to make a giant
butt-shaped mistake.
- That's not for you to say.

329
00:19:32,871 --> 00:19:36,440
OK. Well, someone has to. The
only reason a woman does something

330
00:19:36,543 --> 00:19:40,023
like this to her body is to impress a
guy. Sure, it starts with a giant butt.

331
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:42,224
Then the next thing you know,
she's giving up her friends.

332
00:19:42,248 --> 00:19:44,109
She's moving in with him
before she's even ready.

333
00:19:44,133 --> 00:19:46,645
If she's not careful, she'll find
herself a 26-year-old step-mother

334
00:19:46,669 --> 00:19:47,996
to the pregnant daughter
she didn't even know he had.

335
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:51,104
Then she's single, dying
her hair a new color,

336
00:19:51,206 --> 00:19:52,551
and, you know what? It's
really hard to manage your roots

337
00:19:52,575 --> 00:19:54,686
when you've been
committed to the psych ward.

338
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:56,327
Psych ward?

339
00:19:59,649 --> 00:20:01,181
It happens.

340
00:20:08,507 --> 00:20:11,842
Great. You're in here.
Now, where can I sulk?

341
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:15,464
There's plenty of room. That's
all I'm doing. Please, sit down.

342
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:21,952
- What's the matter?
- I have been down in the morgue

343
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:25,656
all morning trying to determine
the cause of death for Mary Portman,

344
00:20:25,758 --> 00:20:27,975
who survived the
horrors of Gary Clark,

345
00:20:28,077 --> 00:20:31,278
only to die from a surgery
that I perform every day.

346
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:35,049
So it's very important to me, and
it's very important to Mary's husband,

347
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:38,719
to find some answers today.
But do you know what is important

348
00:20:38,821 --> 00:20:41,655
to the pathologist who
is leading the autopsy?

349
00:20:41,757 --> 00:20:45,158
Oh, her dinner reservations.
And her lunch break.

350
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:48,479
Basically, food, that's what's
important to this pathologist.

351
00:20:52,485 --> 00:20:55,252
- Feeling better?
- No. Not really, no.

352
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:57,421
What's all this?

353
00:20:57,523 --> 00:20:59,873
Oh, I'm just trying to
write this grant proposal.

354
00:20:59,975 --> 00:21:02,609
- Why only trying?
- Because the more you research

355
00:21:02,712 --> 00:21:06,012
Alzheimer's, the more depressing
it gets. And then, when you include

356
00:21:06,114 --> 00:21:10,868
the early onset, the type that Ellis
Grey suffered from, it just gets worse.

357
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:13,687
There's a woman
in England, she's 32,

358
00:21:13,789 --> 00:21:16,223
she can't recognize her
three-year-old daughter.

359
00:21:16,325 --> 00:21:19,025
It's just terrifying.

360
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:24,181
This pathologist also
chews gum while she works.

361
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:28,486
Oh, my God. That's disgusting.

362
00:21:29,605 --> 00:21:31,272
Thank you.

363
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:35,816
- Christy.
- Yes.

364
00:21:35,912 --> 00:21:37,878
Dr. Grey is concerned that

365
00:21:37,997 --> 00:21:39,575
you might be going
through with this surgery

366
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:40,725
for the wrong reasons, that you

367
00:21:40,749 --> 00:21:43,117
might be trying to
please someone

368
00:21:43,219 --> 00:21:48,255
who prefers a more...
robust body type.

369
00:21:49,709 --> 00:21:53,360
Dr. Grey, I hope you don't
take this the wrong way.

370
00:21:53,462 --> 00:21:57,214
But even through your lab coat, I
can tell you have an amazing ass.

371
00:21:57,316 --> 00:22:00,017
And with an ass like that, I
bet you know what it's like

372
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:02,603
to find a perfect pair of jeans.
Jeans that make you feel like

373
00:22:02,705 --> 00:22:06,139
you're the sexiest person
to ever put on a pair of pants.

374
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:08,976
And I envy that
'cause I never have.

375
00:22:09,078 --> 00:22:13,897
Every pair hangs off me. Unless
I shop in the boys' department.

376
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:16,066
And I've tried gaining
weight, Dr. Grey.

377
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:19,637
It turns out I'm a person whose fat goes
straight to my upper arms and my boobs.

378
00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:22,289
Which makes it really hard
for me to wear a sundress.

379
00:22:22,391 --> 00:22:26,727
Which is all I can wear,
because jeans don't fit.

380
00:22:26,829 --> 00:22:30,915
So, Dr. Grey, I'm
getting a big, juicy,

381
00:22:31,017 --> 00:22:36,453
easy-to-grab-onto ass, and you'd
better believe I'm doing it just for me.

382
00:22:36,555 --> 00:22:40,007
And I'm telling
you, I can't wait.

383
00:22:44,263 --> 00:22:46,697
You are so nice.

384
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:49,850
Red Team's
patients have all died!

385
00:22:49,952 --> 00:22:53,821
Only Blue Team remains.
Keep an eye on Karev.

386
00:22:53,923 --> 00:22:56,223
That's what
resourceful looks like.

387
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,526
Good effort, Avery.

388
00:23:01,013 --> 00:23:02,780
But this incision
you made is too wide.

389
00:23:02,882 --> 00:23:06,232
You lacerated the
superior thyroid arteries.

390
00:23:06,335 --> 00:23:08,268
- Move on.
- Damn it!

391
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:11,638
- I hear it. I hear the helicopter!
- You what?

392
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:14,458
- I hear it! I hear it!
- Wake up!

393
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,628
You don't hear the helicopter
because A, it's imaginary,

394
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:21,598
and B, the imaginary
helicopter is never coming!

395
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:24,785
Hunt's trying to break us, trying
to teach us some BS lesson

396
00:23:24,887 --> 00:23:27,788
about how trauma
isn't fair or whatever!

397
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:31,442
We're not done until he says
these dummies are dead! The end!

398
00:23:31,544 --> 00:23:35,162
It's not true! No,
you are wrong!

399
00:23:39,268 --> 00:23:42,569
- Screw this. I'm done.
- What?

400
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:45,539
Jackson!

401
00:23:45,641 --> 00:23:48,759
Avery, where are
you going? Avery!

402
00:23:48,861 --> 00:23:50,811
- Avery, get back here.
- No.

403
00:23:50,913 --> 00:23:52,612
No?

404
00:23:54,816 --> 00:23:56,733
No, sir.

405
00:24:06,913 --> 00:24:09,180
That should do it.

406
00:24:09,282 --> 00:24:11,332
Close her up and call it a day.

407
00:24:11,434 --> 00:24:12,894
Aren't we gonna get a
sample from the brain?

408
00:24:12,918 --> 00:24:15,146
Sure, in about two weeks,
when it's had a chance

409
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:19,189
- to firm up in the formalin.
- It's possible
to cut the brain fresh.

410
00:24:19,275 --> 00:24:22,487
It's also possible that the
moment you cut into a fresh brain,

411
00:24:22,511 --> 00:24:25,162
it slides apart like Jell-O. If
you don't want to risk that,

412
00:24:25,264 --> 00:24:27,542
you put it in formalin
and wait two weeks.

413
00:24:27,566 --> 00:24:29,077
I'm not trying to tell
you how to do your job...

414
00:24:29,101 --> 00:24:31,196
That's exactly what you're trying
to do. And I'm trying very hard

415
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:35,756
not to hold it against you. This
is what I do all day, every day.

416
00:24:35,858 --> 00:24:38,003
I mean, do you think I
failed medical school?

417
00:24:38,027 --> 00:24:40,427
Is that your actual belief, that
people become pathologists

418
00:24:40,463 --> 00:24:43,830
because they fail to
become surgeons?

419
00:24:43,933 --> 00:24:46,350
The autopsy was
inconclusive, Dr. Bailey.

420
00:24:46,452 --> 00:24:50,670
And believe me, I hate that,
at least as much as you do.

421
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:03,149
- He's stable?
- He's critical,

422
00:25:03,251 --> 00:25:05,503
I have to keep checking his
acid-base balance, but yes.

423
00:25:05,605 --> 00:25:08,305
- He's stable-ish for now.
- Great.

424
00:25:08,407 --> 00:25:11,575
So let me take over here, and you
can go give his daughter an update.

425
00:25:11,677 --> 00:25:14,506
No, you go. Um, tell her that
his blood pressure is coming up.

426
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:16,850
- She needs to hear from you.
- He needs to be monitored.

427
00:25:16,916 --> 00:25:18,565
- Well, I can do that.
- OK.

428
00:25:18,667 --> 00:25:20,796
She doesn't need to
hear an update from me.

429
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:23,887
All she wants is to make sure
that I know that she's afraid.

430
00:25:23,989 --> 00:25:27,669
And I can't hear that right now
because I'm scared enough as it is.

431
00:25:27,726 --> 00:25:31,896
I was scared when he coded.
I'm scared now that he's stable.

432
00:25:31,998 --> 00:25:36,317
I'm scared walking across the
lobby. I am scared all the time.

433
00:25:36,419 --> 00:25:38,885
- Well, let me help.
- You cannot help!

434
00:25:38,987 --> 00:25:41,805
- You can't help me!
- Dr. Altman's 30 minutes out.

435
00:25:41,907 --> 00:25:44,074
We need to get him to the OR.

436
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:49,062
- Dr. Grey can help with that.
- Cristina...

437
00:25:54,653 --> 00:25:56,320
Bon voyage!

438
00:25:56,422 --> 00:26:00,624
Oh, my God, it's a
going-away party! You guys!

439
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:04,294
Um, this is a party?

440
00:26:05,431 --> 00:26:07,447
It's a busy day.

441
00:26:08,517 --> 00:26:09,883
No, yeah. I mean I'm...

442
00:26:09,986 --> 00:26:11,930
Just been at this
hospital since residency.

443
00:26:11,954 --> 00:26:17,674
But, uh, if people are too busy
to see me off, they're too busy.

444
00:26:17,777 --> 00:26:21,328
- Callie...
- It's hard
to blame them, Torres.

445
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:23,225
We're down a
couple of attendings.

446
00:26:23,249 --> 00:26:25,632
Things are going to be
busier all around for a while.

447
00:26:25,734 --> 00:26:28,685
Well, I'm glad you
could find the time, chief.

448
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:33,156
With all your chief
problems and big plans.

449
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:35,626
Which were what exactly?

450
00:26:35,728 --> 00:26:40,247
Now, why would I just
give away my good ideas?

451
00:26:44,854 --> 00:26:47,921
- - He's just crabby. He's
messing with your head.

452
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:50,924
Yeah, well, I'll
never know, will I?

453
00:26:58,417 --> 00:27:00,016
Thank you both, so much.

454
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:05,455
Um, I actually have to finish up
some packing, so I'm gonna go.

455
00:27:06,258 --> 00:27:08,876
- Good luck.
- Give 'em hell.

456
00:27:13,248 --> 00:27:17,051
I don't want to go home yet.

457
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:21,354
You want to see us give
a lady a really big ass?

458
00:27:21,456 --> 00:27:23,457
Oh, my God, yes.

459
00:27:32,451 --> 00:27:36,069
Sir! You said the helicopter
was gonna be here hours ago!

460
00:27:36,171 --> 00:27:38,538
And it's not here! And
I'm not complaining,

461
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,893
- but where is it?
- Well, the rain's
still pretty bad.

462
00:27:42,978 --> 00:27:46,413
Probably got caught
in a hail storm.

463
00:27:46,515 --> 00:27:49,749
No! No! I know what
that card is gonna say!

464
00:27:49,851 --> 00:27:52,519
It's gonna say he has
cardiac tamponade

465
00:27:52,621 --> 00:27:55,071
with associated hypotension
and bradycardia! But he can't,

466
00:27:55,157 --> 00:27:57,791
'cause I already did a
pericardiocentesis and bolused him

467
00:27:57,893 --> 00:28:02,145
- with IV fluids!
- She's right. What do I do?

468
00:28:03,281 --> 00:28:05,299
Karev, grab his feet!

469
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:10,520
- The patient! Come on!
- Hey, hey!

470
00:28:10,622 --> 00:28:12,233
Son of a bitch, that's awesome!

471
00:28:12,257 --> 00:28:13,835
What do you think you're doing?

472
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:17,460
- The ambulance is not in play.
- You're just making stuff up!

473
00:28:17,563 --> 00:28:19,757
Which I can do, too,
and I say it is in play!

474
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:24,401
You can't fit nine patients on an
ambulance, but two will fit just fine!

475
00:28:24,503 --> 00:28:28,088
Seven of my patients may have
died today, but these two won't

476
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:31,742
because I'm gonna get
them on this ambulance

477
00:28:31,844 --> 00:28:34,978
and I'm gonna take them
to that hospital right there!

478
00:28:37,983 --> 00:28:39,215
All right!

479
00:28:42,538 --> 00:28:46,539
Kepner, this ambulance was involved
in the accident and no longer runs.

480
00:28:46,641 --> 00:28:48,321
The keys are in the
ignition, so let's see!

481
00:28:50,613 --> 00:28:55,048
Looks like I got AAA.
Apparently, they could get here

482
00:28:55,151 --> 00:29:00,286
when the helicopter couldn't!
Now, move, or I will run you down!

483
00:29:00,388 --> 00:29:04,641
Go!

484
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:21,391
John Doe, multiple chest
and extremity trauma.

485
00:29:21,493 --> 00:29:25,461
Still hypotensive despite two
large bore IVs started in the field.

486
00:29:25,563 --> 00:29:28,532
- All right, Kepner. That's enough.
- He needs a full work-up

487
00:29:28,634 --> 00:29:32,018
and likely a thoracotomy. I
suspect active bleeding in the chest.

488
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:34,098
Will you tell us we won,
or she's never gonna stop.

489
00:29:34,122 --> 00:29:36,940
- It's not a contest.
- Karev, call the OR

490
00:29:37,042 --> 00:29:39,960
- and make sure
a room's available.
- Will do.

491
00:29:40,062 --> 00:29:42,012
All right, all right, fine!

492
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:44,598
- Blue Team wins.
- Blue Team wins?

493
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:45,982
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You win.

494
00:29:46,084 --> 00:29:47,844
He's gonna live
for 40 more years

495
00:29:47,887 --> 00:29:49,969
and have 15
grandkids. You happy?

496
00:29:50,071 --> 00:29:51,688
- Blue Team wins!
- Yes.

497
00:29:51,791 --> 00:29:53,323
Yeah!

498
00:29:53,425 --> 00:29:56,860
Yes!

499
00:29:56,962 --> 00:29:59,829
Yeah!

500
00:30:06,355 --> 00:30:07,620
Here. Check that out.

501
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:10,924
"Alzheimer's is a bad
disease. We should cure it."

502
00:30:11,026 --> 00:30:13,543
Twelve hours worth of work.

503
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:17,447
Dr. Stanley refuses
to cut into Mary's brain

504
00:30:17,549 --> 00:30:20,383
without letting it set in
fixative for two weeks.

505
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:25,538
- I need you
to go over her head.
- I can't do that.

506
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:28,608
She's right. I can't speed up the
process any more than she can.

507
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:31,811
That is not what you
were supposed to say.

508
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:35,616
Miranda, I know this has been
a very personal loss for you.

509
00:30:36,702 --> 00:30:38,968
But you need to let it go.

510
00:30:42,291 --> 00:30:45,092
I have to go and
tell Mary's husband

511
00:30:45,194 --> 00:30:47,894
that I don't know
why his wife died.

512
00:30:47,996 --> 00:30:52,199
That I can't answer the
one question he has to ask.

513
00:30:52,301 --> 00:30:54,834
And I can't answer that
question because medicine,

514
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:58,338
because science, is failing
me. That, I take personally.

515
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,240
That, I can't accept.

516
00:31:00,342 --> 00:31:03,921
And don't you dare stand there
and talk to me about letting things go.

517
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:08,198
I'm not the one who can't stop
thinking about the possibility of his wife

518
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:12,202
getting Alzheimer's long
enough to write a damn essay.

519
00:31:23,732 --> 00:31:27,417
- Shouldn't you be
with the patient?
- He's prepped and in the OR.

520
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:28,799
And now you're gonna talk to me.

521
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:30,954
Please just go back downstairs.

522
00:31:33,458 --> 00:31:34,875
Cristina.

523
00:31:39,798 --> 00:31:42,265
How are you fine?

524
00:31:42,367 --> 00:31:44,217
How are you just
completely fine?

525
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:46,252
I'm ruined, OK?

526
00:31:46,355 --> 00:31:48,121
I am dead. I am wrecked.

527
00:31:48,223 --> 00:31:50,990
And you're just walking
around baby-sitting me,

528
00:31:51,092 --> 00:31:53,009
as if you didn't go through
the same thing, too?

529
00:31:53,112 --> 00:31:56,613
- Why are you OK?
- I don't know.

530
00:31:56,715 --> 00:31:59,148
You were there, too, you
know. You were there, too,

531
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,785
with your sad eyes,
screaming at me to save his life.

532
00:32:01,887 --> 00:32:04,755
Telling the guy to shoot you,
and not giving a crap about yourself

533
00:32:04,857 --> 00:32:06,539
- or your pregnancy!
- Cristina!

534
00:32:06,641 --> 00:32:09,209
I didn't have a choice!
And you did that!

535
00:32:09,311 --> 00:32:12,345
If it was anyone else on the table,
if it was anyone else standing there,

536
00:32:12,447 --> 00:32:13,625
- I would have walked away.
- You would not...

537
00:32:13,649 --> 00:32:15,098
I could have walked away!

538
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,783
And then I wouldn't be here!

539
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:38,388
Walk with me, Dr. Yang.
Tell me everything.

540
00:32:44,697 --> 00:32:47,497
Now, who am I gonna
talk to about women?

541
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:51,368
- You have Derek.
- He's married
and self-satisfied.

542
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:54,204
It's irritating.

543
00:32:54,306 --> 00:32:56,506
You can always email.

544
00:32:59,645 --> 00:33:04,064
- What?
- It's not my place. Um...

545
00:33:05,701 --> 00:33:07,166
Say it.

546
00:33:10,939 --> 00:33:14,824
- I give a lot of boob jobs.
- OK.

547
00:33:14,926 --> 00:33:16,771
Not where I thought
you were going.

548
00:33:16,795 --> 00:33:19,829
But I also reverse
a lot of boob jobs.

549
00:33:19,931 --> 00:33:25,819
Women come to me, a year, two
years after they've had work done,

550
00:33:25,921 --> 00:33:29,222
and they're totally unhappy
with the decision they've made.

551
00:33:29,324 --> 00:33:34,110
Today, though, you watched
me give a lady a really big ass.

552
00:33:34,212 --> 00:33:36,746
And I'm not the slightest
bit worried about it

553
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:40,066
because I know for a fact there's
no boyfriend pressuring her.

554
00:33:40,168 --> 00:33:43,886
It wasn't about anyone
else. It was for her.

555
00:33:43,988 --> 00:33:46,873
As your friend,
I gotta tell you,

556
00:33:46,975 --> 00:33:50,710
you sound an awful lot like
someone who's getting double-D's

557
00:33:50,812 --> 00:33:52,862
just 'cause her
girlfriend likes a big rack.

558
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,684
By big rack, I mean Africa.

559
00:34:02,857 --> 00:34:06,076
- I love her, Mark.
- I know you do.

560
00:34:06,178 --> 00:34:09,078
But you need to figure out

561
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:11,331
how to love Africa, too.

562
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:34,170
Avery, hey.

563
00:34:34,273 --> 00:34:36,773
Hey. You don't get to just
walk away when I'm teaching.

564
00:34:36,859 --> 00:34:40,510
Two of my friends died
during the shooting. So thanks,

565
00:34:40,612 --> 00:34:43,864
I don't need lessons
on how unfair trauma is.

566
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:52,788
I lost dozens of friends
in the field. Dozens.

567
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:58,077
And I have never, never
used them as an excuse to quit!

568
00:34:58,179 --> 00:35:01,815
You're a doctor, Avery. And that doesn't
stop because you're up against a wall.

569
00:35:01,917 --> 00:35:04,801
You need to figure
out how to be a doctor,

570
00:35:04,903 --> 00:35:08,104
no matter what you're dealing with,
no matter what tools you don't have.

571
00:35:08,206 --> 00:35:11,874
That is the lesson you need
to learn. You don't get to quit!

572
00:35:11,977 --> 00:35:14,311
So if I need to drag
you outside by the throat,

573
00:35:14,413 --> 00:35:17,414
you're coming with me
and you're going to finish!

574
00:35:22,938 --> 00:35:25,149
If his heart doesn't start beating
soon, we're not gonna be able

575
00:35:25,173 --> 00:35:29,943
- to take him off bypass.
- - He's back up to his core temperature.

576
00:35:30,045 --> 00:35:33,096
I don't see any leaks. All
the connections are right.

577
00:35:33,198 --> 00:35:37,617
We're just gonna have to wait and
see if Dr. Yang's hard work has paid off.

578
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:53,383
There it is. Nice
work, Dr. Yang.

579
00:35:53,485 --> 00:35:56,052
Well done.

580
00:35:59,307 --> 00:36:00,773
Clamp.

581
00:36:07,532 --> 00:36:09,243
You know, sure, there's
not a lot to do over there,

582
00:36:09,267 --> 00:36:11,813
but, uh, that just means less
to distract us from the medicine.

583
00:36:11,837 --> 00:36:16,272
It'll just be us, focusing on
the medicine, which is great.

584
00:36:16,357 --> 00:36:18,975
What? Oh, my God. Did
you forget your passport?

585
00:36:20,195 --> 00:36:22,712
I won the Carter Madison Grant.

586
00:36:22,814 --> 00:36:27,167
I won the Carter Madison Grant.
Do you know how rare that is?

587
00:36:27,269 --> 00:36:28,868
Do you know how special that is?

588
00:36:28,971 --> 00:36:32,472
This is the biggest opportunity
of my professional career.

589
00:36:32,574 --> 00:36:35,275
I get to go to Malawi with almost
unlimited funds and help children,

590
00:36:35,376 --> 00:36:39,612
help tiny humans who might
otherwise never see a pediatric surgeon.

591
00:36:39,714 --> 00:36:41,931
I get to change lives.
That's the dream.

592
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:46,469
I am living the dream. And I am
over the moon about it, or I would be.

593
00:36:46,571 --> 00:36:48,922
But you are ruining it for me.

594
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:51,408
First with your whining, and
now with your fake, smiley

595
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:54,728
passive aggressive enthusiasm.
You're ruining Africa for me.

596
00:36:54,830 --> 00:36:56,729
- I'm not.
- You are!

597
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:03,787
OK. Fine. I don't
want to go to Africa.

598
00:37:03,889 --> 00:37:09,408
OK? But I do want to be with
you, OK? So I'm really trying here.

599
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:11,910
We're gonna miss
our plane. Let's go.

600
00:37:12,513 --> 00:37:14,659
Oh, my God. OK, you wanna fight?

601
00:37:14,683 --> 00:37:17,249
The flight's 18 hours.
We can fight on the plane.

602
00:37:17,351 --> 00:37:21,054
You are ruining this for me.

603
00:37:21,156 --> 00:37:24,974
- And I don't want to do this.
- What... What does that mean?

604
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:27,444
What, you suddenly
don't want to go, or...?

605
00:37:30,249 --> 00:37:33,249
I don't want to go
to Africa with you.

606
00:37:39,007 --> 00:37:41,374
Arizona...

607
00:37:42,044 --> 00:37:44,878
No. OK?

608
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:47,446
- No.
- I'm sorry.

609
00:37:47,549 --> 00:37:51,517
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry? It's three years!

610
00:37:54,973 --> 00:37:57,440
I'm gonna miss my plane.

611
00:37:59,844 --> 00:38:02,345
You take care of yourself.

612
00:38:06,652 --> 00:38:09,468
No! No!

613
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:16,226
Please. Please, I can...

614
00:38:16,328 --> 00:38:19,512
We can do this. We
can figure this out.

615
00:38:21,516 --> 00:38:26,018
You stay here and be happy.

616
00:38:26,121 --> 00:38:29,822
And I'll go there and be happy.

617
00:38:29,925 --> 00:38:33,026
If you get on the plane, if you
go without me, we are done.

618
00:38:33,127 --> 00:38:36,162
Do you hear me? We are over!

619
00:38:36,264 --> 00:38:41,300
We are standing in the middle of
an airport screaming at each other.

620
00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:44,904
We're already over.

621
00:38:58,486 --> 00:39:00,686
Yang.

622
00:39:05,543 --> 00:39:07,943
Dr. Altman told me
about your work today.

623
00:39:08,796 --> 00:39:09,796
I know it's been hell

624
00:39:09,897 --> 00:39:11,864
for you these past few months.

625
00:39:11,967 --> 00:39:15,952
So... well done.

626
00:39:16,671 --> 00:39:18,671
Thank you, sir.

627
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:23,977
Chief?

628
00:39:25,213 --> 00:39:26,763
Do you have a minute?

629
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:30,066
I can't wait until
the next skills lab.

630
00:39:30,168 --> 00:39:31,551
I'm totally on your team.

631
00:39:31,653 --> 00:39:36,789
"Move or I'll run you
down!" Freaking hilarious.

632
00:39:41,446 --> 00:39:44,247
<i>We're all looking for answers.</i>

633
00:39:44,349 --> 00:39:46,182
<i>In medicine...</i>

634
00:39:46,868 --> 00:39:48,334
<i>in life...</i>

635
00:39:49,821 --> 00:39:51,704
<i>in everything.</i>

636
00:40:00,348 --> 00:40:02,593
Were you just
checking out my ass?

637
00:40:02,617 --> 00:40:06,269
Not the first time.
Won't be the last.

638
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:10,089
No.

639
00:40:17,465 --> 00:40:20,399
<i>Sometimes, the
answers we're looking for</i>

640
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:23,569
<i>have been hiding
just below the surface.</i>

641
00:40:27,092 --> 00:40:30,059
I had the worst day today.

642
00:40:30,161 --> 00:40:33,696
I've been working, um...
working on the grant proposal,

643
00:40:33,798 --> 00:40:35,999
and I just, I couldn't do it.

644
00:40:36,101 --> 00:40:38,367
Then I realized...

645
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:43,456
it was you.

646
00:40:45,126 --> 00:40:47,427
It's a clinical trial
for Alzheimer's.

647
00:40:47,529 --> 00:40:51,748
It's serious work, and I
couldn't think of anything but you.

648
00:40:51,850 --> 00:40:53,294
I know you want to
be a part of the trial,

649
00:40:53,318 --> 00:40:56,001
but I can't have you
anywhere near it.

650
00:41:03,978 --> 00:41:05,928
Cristina blames me.

651
00:41:10,652 --> 00:41:12,752
She hates me.

652
00:41:14,288 --> 00:41:16,122
<i>Other times,</i>

653
00:41:16,224 --> 00:41:18,135
<i>we find answers when
we didn't even realize</i>

654
00:41:18,159 --> 00:41:20,660
<i>we were asking the question.</i>

655
00:41:24,399 --> 00:41:26,098
Avery, good.

656
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,668
<i>Sometimes, the
answers can catch us</i>

657
00:41:28,770 --> 00:41:30,803
<i>completely by surprise.</i>

658
00:41:34,642 --> 00:41:37,026
Hey, hey, hey. Did you hear?

659
00:41:37,128 --> 00:41:41,230
The lab, it could not have gone
better. You should have seen Kepner.

660
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:43,972
You wouldn't think it to look at
her, but there is a trauma surgeon

661
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:47,486
in that girl. I wish you
could have been there.

662
00:41:47,588 --> 00:41:50,840
- How was your day?
- I quit.

663
00:41:51,793 --> 00:41:54,660
- What?
- You were right.

664
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:57,430
I can do it. I can
still be a surgeon.

665
00:41:57,532 --> 00:42:02,218
I just... don't want to anymore.

666
00:42:04,205 --> 00:42:09,225
<i>And sometimes, even when we find
the answer we've been looking for...</i>

667
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:12,978
Avery, that's enough.

668
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:18,601
<i>We're still left with a whole</i>

669
00:42:18,703 --> 00:42:21,237
<i>hell of a lot of questions.</i>
