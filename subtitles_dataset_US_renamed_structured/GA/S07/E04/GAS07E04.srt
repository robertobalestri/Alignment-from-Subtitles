1
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:06,705
<i>Biology determines
much of the way we live.</i>

2
00:00:06,807 --> 00:00:10,341
<i>From the moment we're born,
we know how to breathe and eat.</i>

3
00:00:10,443 --> 00:00:12,911
<i>As we grow older,
new instincts kick in.</i>

4
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:13,879
Oh.

5
00:00:13,981 --> 00:00:15,621
<i>- We become territorial.</i>
- Towel?

6
00:00:15,699 --> 00:00:17,515
Oh.

7
00:00:19,202 --> 00:00:20,635
Ow!

8
00:00:20,737 --> 00:00:23,138
- Oh! Sorry! Sorry.
- Jeez.

9
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,057
Yeah.

10
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:30,545
You know this isn't normal?

11
00:00:32,149 --> 00:00:33,715
<i>We learn to compete.</i>

12
00:00:37,338 --> 00:00:39,637
- Let's go, Torres!
- Oh, shoot.

13
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:42,318
- I told him we'd
work out this morning.
- This is like working out,

14
00:00:42,342 --> 00:00:44,821
- it's just more fun.
- - Come on, no pain, no gain!

15
00:00:44,845 --> 00:00:46,711
- Go away, Mark!
- What?

16
00:00:46,813 --> 00:00:48,363
Be nice. He's lonely.

17
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:51,182
- Did you just say my...?
- Oh!

18
00:00:51,284 --> 00:00:54,102
Right. Nice.

19
00:00:54,204 --> 00:00:56,855
- You finish. I'll wait.
- Uh...

20
00:01:03,246 --> 00:01:06,726
<i>- We seek shelter.
- </i> - Take a look at some of the fine details up here.

21
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,984
It was built around
the turn of the century.

22
00:01:09,086 --> 00:01:11,987
- These are the original doors?
- You bet.

23
00:01:12,089 --> 00:01:15,023
Wait till you see the upstairs.

24
00:01:16,393 --> 00:01:19,211
Antique hardware on those
windows. That's a cool fireplace.

25
00:01:19,313 --> 00:01:21,296
You know, it's
really a lot of space.

26
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:26,234
If we knock through this wall,
we'd get all that light to flood through.

27
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:29,053
You like the fireman's pole?

28
00:01:31,608 --> 00:01:33,091
Hm...

29
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:40,882
OK, um, this could be our
house. I kinda need you to care.

30
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:49,524
We'll think about it.

31
00:01:49,643 --> 00:01:51,726
<i>Most important of all?</i>

32
00:01:51,828 --> 00:01:54,195
<i>We reproduce.</i>

33
00:01:54,297 --> 00:01:57,198
I drank a lot of
tequila in college.

34
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:00,752
- After.
- It's been a while
since I've done OB rotations,

35
00:02:00,854 --> 00:02:03,322
but I don't recall tequila
getting in the way of conception.

36
00:02:03,424 --> 00:02:08,193
- It's the opposite, actually.
- I could have,
uh, endometriosis

37
00:02:08,278 --> 00:02:10,345
- or adhesions or...
- She's gonna come in here

38
00:02:10,447 --> 00:02:11,824
and she's gonna
say everything's fine.

39
00:02:11,848 --> 00:02:16,118
<i>Sometimes biology
can turn on us, though.</i>

40
00:02:18,905 --> 00:02:22,291
So, we have a few
things to discuss here.

41
00:02:25,329 --> 00:02:29,180
<i>Yeah, biology sucks sometimes.</i>

42
00:02:30,818 --> 00:02:33,819
Hostile? Did she really
call my uterus hostile?

43
00:02:33,921 --> 00:02:35,832
Are you forgetting
what she said after that?

44
00:02:35,856 --> 00:02:38,991
What? About my hostile uterus
causing me to miscarry the first time?

45
00:02:39,093 --> 00:02:40,770
Or the likelihood
that it'll happen again?

46
00:02:40,794 --> 00:02:42,794
- That there is a treatment,
she said.
- Hostile.

47
00:02:42,897 --> 00:02:45,158
- You're just getting
stuck on a word.
- How would you feel

48
00:02:45,182 --> 00:02:48,650
if she called your
penis angry or snide?

49
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:50,946
That's a good point. But the
important thing is that you're healthy.

50
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:53,505
Just think of all the fun
we're gonna have trying now.

51
00:02:55,775 --> 00:02:58,594
I'm late for rounds.

52
00:03:01,732 --> 00:03:05,417
- You paged?
- Did you know that bariatric centers

53
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,698
are some of the leading money-makers
in hospitals right now, Dr. Bailey?

54
00:03:08,722 --> 00:03:11,423
- I have rounds...
- That's interesting,
considering

55
00:03:11,508 --> 00:03:16,344
that Seattle Grace doesn't have one.
Do you know why we don't have one?

56
00:03:16,463 --> 00:03:21,582
Space, Dr. Bailey. We
don't have enough space.

57
00:03:24,638 --> 00:03:29,357
Oh. Chief, OK, if
you go anywhere near

58
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:33,761
my Denny Duquette Memorial Clinic,
you'll come to work tomorrow and find me

59
00:03:33,864 --> 00:03:36,164
and every nurse who loves
me chained to its doors.

60
00:03:36,266 --> 00:03:40,218
We need money, Bailey. Ever since
the shooting, we've been in survival mode

61
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:44,405
when we need to be in fight mode.
Ground-breaking surgery mode.

62
00:03:44,508 --> 00:03:46,858
Back to number one ranking mode.

63
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:53,164
It's my turn to have
Cristina Yang on my service.

64
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:56,718
That's all the fight
I have in me today.

65
00:03:59,189 --> 00:04:03,991
- Hostile uterus.
- House hunting with my husband.

66
00:04:04,093 --> 00:04:06,260
At least it's not cancer.

67
00:04:06,363 --> 00:04:08,207
At least you're calling
him your husband.

68
00:04:08,231 --> 00:04:10,165
Oh. Baby steps. Whatev.

69
00:04:10,267 --> 00:04:13,702
Hey. Do you know how long April and
Jackson are planning to stay in the house?

70
00:04:13,804 --> 00:04:17,572
- As long as they like. Why?
- April's taken
over Izzie's room.

71
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:20,308
Which was fine when it was
temporary, but I live in the attic.

72
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:22,894
And I sleep next to
Christmas ornaments.

73
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:26,414
April's best friend just died.

74
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:27,916
She's all alone.

75
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:30,385
I'm not evil, it's just...

76
00:04:30,487 --> 00:04:32,821
She's annoying, OK?
I find her annoying.

77
00:04:32,923 --> 00:04:35,523
Really? I find you
much more annoying.

78
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:38,392
A car ran into a
Laundromat! Multiple traumas!

79
00:04:40,096 --> 00:04:42,547
- I'm not wrong.
- Hm...

80
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:44,499
Pretty annoying.

81
00:04:45,802 --> 00:04:47,735
You coming?

82
00:04:49,306 --> 00:04:52,473
Baby steps don't include
multiple traumas. You go kill it.

83
00:04:58,948 --> 00:05:01,249
Ooh! Hi. You need to start
sleeping with Mark again.

84
00:05:01,351 --> 00:05:03,919
- I do?
- Yeah. For my sake. You do.

85
00:05:04,021 --> 00:05:07,655
He won't leave us alone, at the
apartment, at work, in our bedroom.

86
00:05:07,758 --> 00:05:10,798
It's like I'm dating Mark against my
will. Come on. Twice a week. That's all.

87
00:05:10,861 --> 00:05:14,306
I am not baby-sitting Mark for
you. Besides, I'm too tired for sex

88
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:17,393
with anyone right now. I was up
all night dictating charts. Again.

89
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:19,579
There's a thing called a
resident that can do that for you.

90
00:05:19,603 --> 00:05:21,280
Yeah, and my resident is Avery.

91
00:05:21,304 --> 00:05:22,988
Still knocking over
trays in the OR?

92
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:25,985
Yes, and scribbling patient
orders in his third-grade scrawl,

93
00:05:26,009 --> 00:05:28,855
and paging me in the middle of the night
for patients who are nowhere near dying.

94
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:32,297
- At least he's nice to look at.
- True.

95
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,832
Thank you.

96
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:40,588
You just got called
a dumb blonde.

97
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:43,074
Can you find out about my
husband? His name's Larry.

98
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,911
- He was in the car with you?
- No, he was in the Laundromat.

99
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:50,449
I hit him! I don't remember anything. I
was in the car outside the Laundromat.

100
00:05:50,551 --> 00:05:53,351
The next thing I know, the
car's inside the Laundromat

101
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:56,571
- and there's screaming
and...
- OK.

102
00:05:56,673 --> 00:05:59,690
Do you want to order
her labs or take her scans?

103
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:02,004
You can take her.
Take it all. Taker.

104
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,707
- What?
- Lost vitals
in the ambulance bay.

105
00:06:03,731 --> 00:06:06,171
Get me epi and charge
the defibrillator now!

106
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,316
That's him! That's my husband!

107
00:06:08,418 --> 00:06:10,968
It's... Is he gonna be OK?

108
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,970
I cannot go out this way.

109
00:06:13,073 --> 00:06:17,209
I can't die in a freak
Laundromat accident. Ow!

110
00:06:17,311 --> 00:06:20,645
- Sorry.
- You cannot
find anything wrong.

111
00:06:20,748 --> 00:06:23,949
I'm supposed to go
to Brazil next week.

112
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:27,635
Rio. I just perfected my accent.

113
00:06:29,506 --> 00:06:32,407
I'm fine. How are you?

114
00:06:32,509 --> 00:06:35,243
Nope. I just asked you
if you had a condom.

115
00:06:35,345 --> 00:06:38,697
'Cause that's the one sentence I
learn before traveling someplace new.

116
00:06:38,799 --> 00:06:41,950
Yeah. Now, you
totally think I'm a slut.

117
00:06:42,051 --> 00:06:44,920
No, I don't. Um... Take
a breath for me, please.

118
00:06:45,022 --> 00:06:47,955
It totally makes
you think I'm a slut.

119
00:06:48,058 --> 00:06:50,325
Until I tell you I have
Huntington's Disease.

120
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:59,751
Yeah, you're not gonna
find it on the chart.

121
00:06:59,853 --> 00:07:03,388
The paramedic was so cute,
so I just didn't mention anything,

122
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:05,657
because the whole
fatal genetic condition,

123
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:10,028
- it just doesn't scream sexy.
- Have you started
showing symptoms?

124
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:13,564
No. My, um... my mother died.

125
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:18,353
So I got tested for the gene. She
was 45, so I have about ten years left.

126
00:07:18,455 --> 00:07:21,640
Five, if you count the
ones I can actually enjoy.

127
00:07:21,742 --> 00:07:25,093
Well, the accident shouldn't
affect your Huntington's.

128
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:27,790
I know that. I'm just telling you so
that you get that you have to work

129
00:07:27,814 --> 00:07:31,349
really hard to fix me. Because I can
live with the fact that I'm gonna die.

130
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,885
But to die doing laundry? No.

131
00:07:33,987 --> 00:07:38,122
I wanna accidentally fall off the
Eiffel Tower because the three men

132
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:40,659
and the multiple
orgasms were too much.

133
00:07:42,612 --> 00:07:44,228
You should've
seen it, Dr. Robbins.

134
00:07:44,331 --> 00:07:46,831
His "pottaballet" kicked
the other kids' asses.

135
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:49,934
- It's pas de bourrée, Dad.
- Isn't that what I said?

136
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:53,487
You said it in American, Fred.
It's French. Right, sweetie?

137
00:07:53,589 --> 00:07:56,558
Yes. And it's not something
that you really kick ass at.

138
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:59,744
Can we talk about the cancer
now? Anything to make them stop?

139
00:07:59,846 --> 00:08:01,480
Yeah. Um, Dr. Karev?

140
00:08:01,582 --> 00:08:05,066
Jake Fisher, 15,
osteosarcoma of the right tibia.

141
00:08:05,168 --> 00:08:07,212
Today he'll be getting
a minor bone dissection.

142
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:09,304
How long after the surgery
before I can dance again?

143
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:13,258
He's anxious 'cause his ballet
company's doing<i> Swan Lake</i> this spring.

144
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,843
It's like his Super Bowl.

145
00:08:15,945 --> 00:08:18,680
Jake, your recovery will
depend on today's scans.

146
00:08:18,782 --> 00:08:20,610
They'll tell us how much
the chemo shrunk the tumor.

147
00:08:20,634 --> 00:08:22,801
But trust me, we
will have you back

148
00:08:22,903 --> 00:08:25,353
on your feet as
soon as possible.

149
00:08:25,455 --> 00:08:27,388
Can you tell me when
the pain started, Mr. Fink?

150
00:08:27,491 --> 00:08:31,643
A few days ago. I'm a biologist.
I'm in the middle of an experiment...

151
00:08:31,745 --> 00:08:34,762
Pan!

152
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:37,582
Oh! Stop!

153
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:40,951
Don't take that anywhere!
That could be research lost.

154
00:08:41,037 --> 00:08:43,938
Sir, you're very sick. You need to
put aside your work for the moment.

155
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:47,541
It's not just work.
It's a cure for asthma.

156
00:08:47,643 --> 00:08:49,393
- What?
- Dr. Bailey?

157
00:08:49,495 --> 00:08:50,740
Just get rid of the vomit, Yang.

158
00:08:50,764 --> 00:08:54,015
I don't think you
want me to do that.

159
00:08:57,020 --> 00:09:01,539
There's my cure.
Isn't he beautiful?

160
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:12,283
Research has found worms produce
an enzyme that cut down on allergies.

161
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:15,470
- I'm applying
the theory to asthma.
- You eat worms?

162
00:09:15,572 --> 00:09:18,372
Yang. How long do
these experiments last?

163
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:23,077
Mm... Standard is a month or two, then
I take the anti-parasitic to pass them.

164
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:28,216
But I can extract more
enzyme the longer I grow them.

165
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:30,602
A year's pushing it, apparently.

166
00:09:30,704 --> 00:09:32,520
You've had these
worms inside you

167
00:09:32,622 --> 00:09:34,989
- for a year?
- 343 days, to be exact.

168
00:09:35,108 --> 00:09:38,776
I haven't had an asthma
attack in six months.

169
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:40,745
Dr. Bailey?

170
00:09:44,885 --> 00:09:46,417
My, they've grown.

171
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:49,687
You have a nasty bowel
obstruction, Mr. Fink.

172
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:52,907
- You need surgery.
- Oh, no, that won't do.

173
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:55,643
Surgery will throw off
the entire experiment.

174
00:09:55,745 --> 00:09:59,080
- I'd like another option.
- Sir, OK, I'm sorry, but...

175
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:02,767
It's three years'
research, Dr. Bailey.

176
00:10:02,869 --> 00:10:06,604
Research you'd be contaminating
the minute you cut me open.

177
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:13,060
OK. Dr. Yang's gonna give you fluid
and put an NG tube down your nose

178
00:10:13,162 --> 00:10:15,997
to open the obstruction.
It will be painful.

179
00:10:16,099 --> 00:10:19,033
And if you don't improve in a few
hours, you're getting the surgery.

180
00:10:19,135 --> 00:10:21,318
Option two it is then.

181
00:10:25,892 --> 00:10:29,127
- You know he's crazy, right?
- Crazy's relative, Yang.

182
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:33,831
In fact, some people might say
that missing rounds this morning

183
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:36,701
when I'm in charge
is crazy behavior, too.

184
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:40,705
But here I am, trusting you
to take care of my patient.

185
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:42,707
Maybe I'm the crazy
one. What do you think?

186
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:45,894
Am I crazy to trust you
to take care of my patient?

187
00:10:45,996 --> 00:10:49,964
No. But I haven't been
swallowing worms.

188
00:10:52,619 --> 00:10:56,170
His pain's not too bad. That means
his tumor probably shrunk, right?

189
00:10:56,273 --> 00:10:59,040
- If the chemo did its job.
- Guess who just scored a table

190
00:10:59,142 --> 00:11:01,525
at that new sushi place
that's impossible to get into?

191
00:11:01,627 --> 00:11:05,096
- No way.
- 8:30, table for three.

192
00:11:05,198 --> 00:11:08,616
- You know, I don't eat sushi.
- Yeah, you do.

193
00:11:08,718 --> 00:11:12,554
Yeah. I did, but then I got sick

194
00:11:12,656 --> 00:11:15,751
after I ate one of those pre-packaged
rolls at the cafeteria. Bad memory.

195
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:20,144
- You two go.
- I'll change the
reservation to two.

196
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:27,251
- What?
- Torres, you should see this.

197
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:32,273
God, I hate this job sometimes.

198
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:35,826
Lila, your CT shows that you
have a ruptured diaphragm.

199
00:11:35,928 --> 00:11:39,914
So you're gonna need surgery.
How will we proceed, Dr. Avery?

200
00:11:40,016 --> 00:11:43,450
Part of your stomach's
gone into your chest,

201
00:11:43,552 --> 00:11:46,571
so we'll place your stomach back
and repair the diaphragm with mesh.

202
00:11:46,673 --> 00:11:49,174
Dr. Grey, do you agree?

203
00:11:49,276 --> 00:11:52,943
I would do a direct repair
with suture instead of mesh

204
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:56,697
- because the defect
is so small.
- That's right.

205
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:00,618
Dr. Grey, draw pre-op
labs. You're scrubbing in.

206
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,733
- Lila, do you need us to call anyone?
- No, it's just me.

207
00:12:03,757 --> 00:12:06,707
But I would really like it if
he would wait by my bedside.

208
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:09,210
Yeah, you and every
other woman in this hospital.

209
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:12,279
- All right, I'll see you in the OR.
- - Thank you.

210
00:12:15,885 --> 00:12:18,870
Oh, please tell me you've
gotten to make out with that.

211
00:12:18,972 --> 00:12:21,238
No. Married. So no.

212
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,791
That's a bummer.

213
00:12:23,893 --> 00:12:26,394
- Any babies?
- Uh, no.

214
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:28,629
But thinking about it.

215
00:12:28,731 --> 00:12:30,865
Um, did you need
me to scrub in, too?

216
00:12:30,967 --> 00:12:35,102
The question should be, "May
I scrub in?" Like you want to.

217
00:12:35,205 --> 00:12:36,971
Right. It's... May I?

218
00:12:37,073 --> 00:12:39,940
No, I think I've got
all the hands I need.

219
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:43,761
Dr. Altman.

220
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:49,333
I know, I've been
off my game lately,

221
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,285
and you've suffered
because of it.

222
00:12:51,387 --> 00:12:55,990
But right now I need you
to give me another chance.

223
00:12:56,092 --> 00:12:58,042
OK, please?

224
00:12:58,144 --> 00:13:03,431
I... I want to scrub in. OK?

225
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:12,924
OK. Yeah. I just, um...

226
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:15,743
OK. OK.

227
00:13:25,005 --> 00:13:28,072
- Mrs. Davis's scans are clean?
- So is her ultrasound.

228
00:13:28,175 --> 00:13:30,552
- I think we should do an EEG.
- Really? Do you
think that's...?

229
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:32,889
She lost control of her parked
car, has no memory of how.

230
00:13:32,913 --> 00:13:34,157
So I think that's necessary.

231
00:13:34,181 --> 00:13:38,232
But you outrank me, so whatever.

232
00:13:39,268 --> 00:13:41,402
Well, sure, fine, let's do it.

233
00:13:41,504 --> 00:13:46,206
Um... Hey, how would you feel if I
started a chore wheel at the house?

234
00:13:46,309 --> 00:13:49,710
The boys are so messy and I did
one with Reed at our old apartment.

235
00:13:49,812 --> 00:13:51,206
And you'd be surprised
how well it works.

236
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:55,483
Are you moving in?
Like, permanently?

237
00:13:55,585 --> 00:14:00,454
Um... Why? Do you think that's not
OK? Should I talk to Meredith about that?

238
00:14:00,556 --> 00:14:03,202
That's up to you. But I wouldn't
bring up the chore wheel.

239
00:14:03,226 --> 00:14:05,526
Meredith would hate that.

240
00:14:05,629 --> 00:14:08,963
- Hey. How's our
reckless driver?
- Uh, she's not reckless.

241
00:14:09,065 --> 00:14:12,366
She may have had
syncope or a seizure.

242
00:14:12,468 --> 00:14:14,980
Hey, Mer, Lexie and I were just
talking about the housing situation...

243
00:14:15,004 --> 00:14:16,582
- If this is
about Izzie's room...
- No.

244
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:18,138
It's not about Izzie's room.

245
00:14:18,257 --> 00:14:23,027
It's about a chore wheel.
April would like to start one.

246
00:14:23,129 --> 00:14:25,662
- That's a great idea.
- What?

247
00:14:25,765 --> 00:14:29,700
Great. I'll set it up tonight. Hey,
um, how'd it go this morning?

248
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:31,863
- Eh!
- - What happened this morning?

249
00:14:31,887 --> 00:14:34,072
- But you're OK, right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

250
00:14:34,174 --> 00:14:36,540
- Why wouldn't you be fine?
- Nothing. I have to go.

251
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:42,563
- What was this morning?
- You should talk to Meredith.

252
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:54,091
What are they saying? Are they
saying the chemo didn't work?

253
00:14:55,778 --> 00:14:58,079
We should wait for your parents.

254
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:01,482
Oh, my God.

255
00:15:02,786 --> 00:15:04,285
You want to cut off my leg.

256
00:15:05,288 --> 00:15:08,455
Oh, my God.

257
00:15:10,593 --> 00:15:14,128
Look there's a
sprinter with prosthetics

258
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:16,025
that runs faster than
guys with real legs.

259
00:15:16,049 --> 00:15:17,899
There's got to be another
way. More chemo...

260
00:15:18,001 --> 00:15:20,885
- Prosthetics today,
it's amazing...
- You don't get it!

261
00:15:20,987 --> 00:15:23,270
I need my leg!

262
00:15:25,008 --> 00:15:27,258
- I get it.
- No, you don't.

263
00:15:28,895 --> 00:15:31,295
It's...

264
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:34,232
I can't explain it.

265
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:35,967
I...

266
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:40,271
Just... I'll show you.

267
00:15:40,373 --> 00:15:43,924
Let me show you.

268
00:15:57,223 --> 00:15:59,824
If he gets injured,
this is on you, Karev.

269
00:16:58,968 --> 00:17:01,952
You see that? That's my boy.

270
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:09,910
It's that... right there.

271
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:13,497
Build me a leg
that'll let me do that.

272
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,439
And she called it
hostile? That's...

273
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:26,476
Well, at least it's nothing too serious.
I'll do research on treatment options.

274
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:30,665
- Her uterus is friendly.
- It's sunshiny.

275
00:17:30,767 --> 00:17:33,650
- Untouched by the
scourge of man.
- Peppy ovaries, too.

276
00:17:33,753 --> 00:17:37,071
Hey. The vending
machine's working again.

277
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:43,210
- What?
- Nothing.

278
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:45,875
Is this the same nothing that has to
do with where you were this morning?

279
00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:49,967
I was at the dentist this
morning. I have bad teeth.

280
00:17:51,621 --> 00:17:54,004
Oh, OK. So teeth
are code for what?

281
00:17:54,107 --> 00:18:00,077
I went to the OB today. I have massive
baby-squishing fibroids in my uterus.

282
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:03,814
- Oh, that's terrible!
- Eh, get over it.

283
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,749
- You knew?
- Knew what?

284
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:07,462
- Nothing.
- The vending machine's working again.

285
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:10,470
- My patient eats worms.
- Dude, Altman fire you yet?

286
00:18:10,573 --> 00:18:13,658
- She's not gonna fire me.
- What'd you do?

287
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,520
She thinks he's a hot
piece of brainless ass.

288
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:16,872
Oh, you're totally
gonna be fired.

289
00:18:16,896 --> 00:18:19,291
Situation is under
control, thank you.

290
00:18:19,315 --> 00:18:21,932
You got a line on any weird
bone cancer treatments,

291
00:18:22,034 --> 00:18:23,762
so I don't have to cut
off my ballerina kid's leg?

292
00:18:23,786 --> 00:18:25,969
Right, cause my
memory's all I'm good for.

293
00:18:26,071 --> 00:18:28,734
There was a story in the news
recently where they used a cadaver bone

294
00:18:28,758 --> 00:18:32,243
- to replace a cancerous one.
- You get my fries.

295
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:42,837
- You paged?
- Dr. Knox's sister
just put her house

296
00:18:42,938 --> 00:18:46,206
on the market. They just redid
it, it's close to Meredith's house

297
00:18:46,308 --> 00:18:49,660
and it has never been
a fire station. Right?

298
00:18:49,762 --> 00:18:53,598
- You paged me
to talk real estate?
- That,

299
00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:56,534
and I thought you
might want to observe.

300
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:59,387
Guy got caught between a
car and a washing machine.

301
00:18:59,489 --> 00:19:03,173
You don't see that kind of crush
injury every day. No pressure.

302
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:08,979
Thank you. But I
have to monitor worms.

303
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:11,348
- A rotationplasty?
- I don't know.

304
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:13,801
It's not possible with
this part of the leg.

305
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:19,674
- Fibular grafting?
- Oh. No. The cancer's
seeded his fibula.

306
00:19:22,544 --> 00:19:25,596
What?

307
00:19:25,698 --> 00:19:28,499
You don't like Mark, admit it.

308
00:19:28,601 --> 00:19:29,928
- I like Mark.
- Liar.

309
00:19:29,952 --> 00:19:32,820
I like him. I do. We're
just... You know.

310
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:36,523
- We're different.
- Oh, my God. How are you different?

311
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:39,376
Tell me. Because I don't
think you actually are.

312
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:40,939
- What?
- Should I leave?

313
00:19:40,963 --> 00:19:45,065
Shut it, Karev. I'm waiting.

314
00:19:47,136 --> 00:19:51,455
Look, it's not that I don't like
Mark. It's just that he's... Mark.

315
00:19:51,558 --> 00:19:54,775
You know? What you
see is what you get.

316
00:19:54,877 --> 00:19:57,489
Besides, you like him. What do I care
if his abs are where his soul should be?

317
00:19:57,513 --> 00:20:01,949
- Oh, my God.
- Found it!

318
00:20:02,818 --> 00:20:04,285
I found it right here!

319
00:20:05,288 --> 00:20:08,305
We don't have
to cut off his leg.

320
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:15,079
- Page Dr. Bailey
and book an OR.
- Surgery?

321
00:20:15,181 --> 00:20:17,915
No, please, can't we
wait just a little longer?

322
00:20:18,017 --> 00:20:20,718
Your bowel could perforate and
fill your abdomen with fecal matter.

323
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:23,921
- So no, we cannot wait.
- Can you at least
salvage the worms

324
00:20:24,023 --> 00:20:26,273
- during the surgery?
- Your life is at risk

325
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:28,441
because of a hypothesis
you can't support.

326
00:20:28,544 --> 00:20:31,444
Otherwise, you'd have the backing
of an actual, accredited institute.

327
00:20:31,547 --> 00:20:33,981
So let the worms go.

328
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:36,466
I worked in those
institutes my whole life.

329
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:40,387
I sat in labs, ran other
people's experiments.

330
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:43,641
I was dead inside. And
now, for the first time,

331
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:47,111
I know what I'm meant to do
with my life. Everything else,

332
00:20:47,213 --> 00:20:51,498
all my quirks, my fears, the
fact that people find me strange,

333
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,985
none of it matters,
because I know who I am.

334
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:56,603
Please.

335
00:20:56,705 --> 00:20:59,173
Save the worms.

336
00:21:03,997 --> 00:21:06,013
Let's get him prepped.

337
00:21:06,115 --> 00:21:11,051
"Stroke, infection, heart attack,
severe bleeding, loss of life."

338
00:21:11,153 --> 00:21:14,704
Oh, what the hell.

339
00:21:19,312 --> 00:21:21,828
- When did the chorea start?
- Chorea?

340
00:21:21,931 --> 00:21:25,099
I call that my
spastic hand trick.

341
00:21:27,269 --> 00:21:31,539
- A few months ago, I guess.
- You told your doctors? They know?

342
00:21:33,776 --> 00:21:36,193
- Lila.
- No guilt trip, please.

343
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:40,014
I was just starting to like you.

344
00:21:40,116 --> 00:21:42,516
But you need to tell your
doctors because they can help.

345
00:21:42,618 --> 00:21:47,137
I watched my mother go through
this, Dr. Grey. I know how this goes.

346
00:21:47,239 --> 00:21:49,623
After the spastic hand
comes the slurred speech.

347
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:53,243
And then the trouble walking
and the difficulty eating,

348
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:56,213
and the seizures
and the memory loss.

349
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:59,066
And then the dementia sets
in so badly that you don't know

350
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:03,804
if you're in the supermarket
or the bathroom.

351
00:22:03,906 --> 00:22:06,890
So screw going to
the freaking doctor.

352
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:10,511
I am going to Brazil.

353
00:22:17,904 --> 00:22:20,571
Ah, Dr. Grey. I
can use your input.

354
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:23,674
Do you think Derek would consider
putting his face on a billboard?

355
00:22:23,776 --> 00:22:27,695
- That's a lot of Derek.
- Pretty good picture, right?

356
00:22:27,797 --> 00:22:29,946
Mm-hm.

357
00:22:32,835 --> 00:22:36,470
- What do you need?
- When my mother was still here,

358
00:22:36,572 --> 00:22:41,541
before she retired, do
you think that she ever

359
00:22:41,644 --> 00:22:44,528
tried to tell you about
the Alzheimer's?

360
00:22:45,648 --> 00:22:48,348
No. She kept it a
secret, for years.

361
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:52,920
No, I know that. But when
do you think it started?

362
00:22:53,022 --> 00:22:56,084
Do you think she was trying to
tell you and you didn't really realize

363
00:22:56,108 --> 00:22:58,348
that's what she was
trying to do, was tell you?

364
00:23:00,029 --> 00:23:05,549
It's possible, I guess.
I don't remember...

365
00:23:05,651 --> 00:23:08,601
Is everything OK, Meredith?

366
00:23:08,704 --> 00:23:11,071
Yeah, it's fine. Just...

367
00:23:13,626 --> 00:23:18,195
I would never go to a hospital
that put its doctors on billboards.

368
00:23:18,297 --> 00:23:19,580
For what it's worth.

369
00:23:29,308 --> 00:23:32,792
His BP's dropped to 90 over 60,
and he's showing signs of peritonitis.

370
00:23:32,895 --> 00:23:35,128
Good work, Yang. You're
free to scrub in if you like.

371
00:23:35,248 --> 00:23:40,367
Uh, even just to observe. No one's
gonna make you do anything you don't want.

372
00:23:46,575 --> 00:23:48,208
I'm not ready.

373
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:50,710
Thank you, though, for asking.

374
00:23:59,071 --> 00:24:02,540
OK, so we'll take
out the bone and then

375
00:24:02,642 --> 00:24:04,486
treat it with high doses of
radiation to kill the cancer.

376
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:08,428
Thirty minutes later, we reinsert
the bone back into Jake's leg.

377
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:11,131
Usually, the procedure's
done using a cadaver bone,

378
00:24:11,233 --> 00:24:13,500
so there's no risk of putting
cancer back in the body.

379
00:24:13,602 --> 00:24:16,103
But we couldn't find a match
for Jake on such short notice.

380
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:18,066
So there's a chance the
cancer can come back?

381
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:19,684
That's why
amputation is less risky.

382
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:22,426
But if we do this, if you agree,

383
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:25,145
we will monitor Jake closely,
scans every few months.

384
00:24:25,247 --> 00:24:28,681
And if the cancer returns,
we'll do the amputation.

385
00:24:28,784 --> 00:24:30,918
But this is done a lot?

386
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:34,104
Uh, it's only been done
a few times in the world.

387
00:24:34,206 --> 00:24:37,791
So if we do this and if we say yes,
there's a chance he'd keep his leg.

388
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:40,243
- Forever.
- We hope.

389
00:24:48,036 --> 00:24:52,656
It's a big risk, buddy. God knows
I love to watch you dance, but...

390
00:24:56,279 --> 00:24:58,128
What would you do?

391
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:05,602
- Oh, that's between
you and your folks.
- No. I want to know.

392
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:09,456
What would you do?

393
00:25:11,226 --> 00:25:15,929
If it was my arm, and I
couldn't operate anymore,

394
00:25:16,031 --> 00:25:19,466
I'd do everything
that I could to keep it.

395
00:25:24,707 --> 00:25:28,425
We've run an EKG, CT
and done blood work.

396
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:30,244
Fortunately, they've
all come back normal.

397
00:25:30,346 --> 00:25:32,079
You mean unfortunately.

398
00:25:32,181 --> 00:25:35,098
They're waiting to
take my statement.

399
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,751
It was just an accident, Mrs. Davis. You
probably just pressed the wrong pedal.

400
00:25:38,854 --> 00:25:40,220
Tell that to them.

401
00:25:40,322 --> 00:25:44,074
They throw people in
jail all the time for this.

402
00:25:47,363 --> 00:25:49,729
- There's another
test we can run.
- What?

403
00:25:49,831 --> 00:25:53,266
It's called a Tilt test. It can tell us
if you fainted before the accident.

404
00:25:53,369 --> 00:25:56,453
We'll schedule it right away.

405
00:25:56,556 --> 00:25:59,089
- Did you get approval for a Tilt test?
- No.

406
00:25:59,191 --> 00:26:01,719
OK, well, I hate to pull rank here,
but I am a year ahead of you...

407
00:26:01,743 --> 00:26:03,760
We're at work, April,
there's no chore wheel.

408
00:26:03,862 --> 00:26:08,449
If I want to run a Tilt test,
I'm gonna run a Tilt test.

409
00:26:10,219 --> 00:26:11,785
I'd throw a party.

410
00:26:11,887 --> 00:26:15,188
Fly everyone to an amazing
beach, all expenses paid.

411
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:19,026
I'd have to max out my credit
cards to pay for it, but what do I care?

412
00:26:19,128 --> 00:26:21,728
I wouldn't be
around to pay it off.

413
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:24,214
- Suction.
- I'd do what Lila did. I'd quit,

414
00:26:24,316 --> 00:26:26,600
sell the house and
bum around the globe.

415
00:26:26,702 --> 00:26:28,151
How would Derek feel about that?

416
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:31,288
Ah, he could come
along if he wanted.

417
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:34,124
There's something sad about
that, though. Wandering around,

418
00:26:34,226 --> 00:26:36,894
living in hotels,
that's not a life.

419
00:26:36,996 --> 00:26:38,745
This, though...

420
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:42,883
Even if I was gonna die
tomorrow, I'd still want to do it.

421
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:49,273
Can I try the diaphragm repair?

422
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:54,061
- What?
- The repair. Can I...

423
00:26:55,231 --> 00:26:57,063
Can I try it?

424
00:27:00,102 --> 00:27:04,488
Uh... No, no, you can't.
I'm good though. Thank you.

425
00:27:17,903 --> 00:27:21,188
Oh, he's hypertensive.
Get his pressure back up!

426
00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:23,623
Get some saline in
here, quick. Clamp.

427
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:27,911
- I need more irrigation in here now!
- - Right away.

428
00:27:28,013 --> 00:27:30,597
- Dr. Bailey, what's wrong?
- He's perforated.

429
00:27:30,699 --> 00:27:33,117
I have to evacuate
this abscess. Suction.

430
00:27:34,803 --> 00:27:37,871
- Can't you just
use antibiotics?
- If I want to risk losing him.

431
00:27:37,973 --> 00:27:40,190
He needs his worms
back for his research.

432
00:27:40,292 --> 00:27:43,610
- The suction will destroy them.
- - I'm concerned about his life now,

433
00:27:43,712 --> 00:27:47,481
Dr. Yang, not his
research. Suction.

434
00:27:58,276 --> 00:28:01,945
You did really good with this
kid today, Karev. Impressive.

435
00:28:02,047 --> 00:28:04,915
Which is funny 'cause I wouldn't
think that you'd be good in Peds

436
00:28:05,017 --> 00:28:06,366
just by looking at you.

437
00:28:07,702 --> 00:28:11,304
OK, fine. I don't
like Mark. At all.

438
00:28:11,406 --> 00:28:14,174
- There, I said it.
- 'Cause you never even tried.

439
00:28:14,276 --> 00:28:15,942
- Oh...
- Take Jake here.

440
00:28:16,062 --> 00:28:18,745
You think his dad was happy
when Jake wanted ballet shoes

441
00:28:18,847 --> 00:28:20,964
for Christmas and not cleats?

442
00:28:21,067 --> 00:28:24,012
No, this guy wanted a kid he could
throw a ball with, you know he did.

443
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:28,805
But his son loved to dance.
So he signed him up for lessons,

444
00:28:28,907 --> 00:28:33,861
went to recitals and learned
what there was to love about ballet.

445
00:28:33,963 --> 00:28:37,498
He tried. Because
he loved his kid.

446
00:28:38,884 --> 00:28:41,918
Mark stares at my
boobs when we talk.

447
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:44,955
He starts at my face, but somewhere
along the way he gets distracted

448
00:28:45,057 --> 00:28:48,241
and ends up on my boobs.
And I love guys. I love them.

449
00:28:48,343 --> 00:28:51,027
But I have tried my whole life
to avoid the boob-staring guy.

450
00:28:51,129 --> 00:28:53,614
Biology even helped
me by making me gay.

451
00:28:53,716 --> 00:28:56,717
But now my girlfriend's
best friend is that guy,

452
00:28:56,819 --> 00:28:59,920
and I don't think I need to apologize
for the fact that the only person I want

453
00:29:00,022 --> 00:29:02,172
- staring at my boobs is you.
- Boobs? Really?

454
00:29:02,274 --> 00:29:05,309
- You're making
this about boobs?
- He stares at them!

455
00:29:05,393 --> 00:29:08,011
- 'Cause they're good boobs!
- Can I leave now?

456
00:29:08,113 --> 00:29:09,646
Yes. Go. Hurry.

457
00:29:12,551 --> 00:29:16,703
So we had to remove his spleen and
a kidney, but I expect a full recovery.

458
00:29:16,805 --> 00:29:19,472
- And the girl that was inside?
- She's out of surgery now.

459
00:29:19,574 --> 00:29:21,425
- She's doing great.
- Oh, thank God.

460
00:29:21,526 --> 00:29:25,362
As for your tests, you're in
tip-top shape, Mrs. Davis.

461
00:29:27,382 --> 00:29:30,116
I'll talk to the police, tell
them to come back tomorrow,

462
00:29:30,218 --> 00:29:33,720
so you can have some
time alone with your husband.

463
00:29:33,822 --> 00:29:38,008
- He's not my husband anymore.
- What?

464
00:29:39,261 --> 00:29:41,489
Larry left me three months ago.

465
00:29:41,513 --> 00:29:45,766
He said he needed
time to himself, to think.

466
00:29:45,868 --> 00:29:48,852
A week later, I find out he's
living with someone else.

467
00:29:48,954 --> 00:29:53,207
Her name's Kimmy.

468
00:29:53,309 --> 00:29:56,376
She sings in the
choir at our church.

469
00:29:57,179 --> 00:29:59,446
Kimmy.

470
00:29:59,548 --> 00:30:01,281
It's a ridiculous name, right?

471
00:30:01,383 --> 00:30:06,169
This morning, I'm on
my way to the post office

472
00:30:06,271 --> 00:30:09,373
when I see his car
outside the Laundromat.

473
00:30:09,475 --> 00:30:14,444
Thirty-eight years of marriage, and not
once did he pick up a bottle of detergent.

474
00:30:15,447 --> 00:30:17,096
So I pulled over.

475
00:30:18,917 --> 00:30:21,802
He was inside,

476
00:30:21,904 --> 00:30:26,590
folding a pair of
hot pink panties.

477
00:30:30,296 --> 00:30:32,796
Doing her laundry!

478
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:36,333
She wasn't even there!

479
00:30:39,071 --> 00:30:43,073
Next thing I know, my
car's inside the Laundromat.

480
00:30:46,712 --> 00:30:51,214
I feel badly... for that...

481
00:30:51,316 --> 00:30:55,735
poor, innocent girl I
hit. I'm glad she's OK.

482
00:30:55,837 --> 00:31:00,006
But... I know now

483
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:01,803
why they call it the
green-eyed monster.

484
00:31:01,827 --> 00:31:06,096
- Mrs. Davis, I think that...
- It's awful to unload on you.

485
00:31:06,198 --> 00:31:10,300
I know, I know. But I
figured you're used to it.

486
00:31:10,402 --> 00:31:12,836
People must tell you
their secrets all the time

487
00:31:12,938 --> 00:31:16,840
because of the doctor-patient
confidentiality law. Right?

488
00:31:19,078 --> 00:31:21,394
That only applies to medicine.

489
00:31:23,465 --> 00:31:27,434
No, no. You are required
to keep my secrets.

490
00:31:27,535 --> 00:31:30,370
No, ma'am, that's lawyers.

491
00:31:39,464 --> 00:31:41,881
Dr. Avery, I need you to...
Oh. I'm sorry, I'll come back.

492
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:45,852
No, no. Please. It's, uh...
It's cool. What do you need?

493
00:31:47,656 --> 00:31:49,723
Right.

494
00:31:51,526 --> 00:31:55,328
I wasn't sure if I was making
up stuff in my head, but...

495
00:31:56,197 --> 00:31:57,880
now I know.

496
00:32:04,406 --> 00:32:06,434
I'm doing a CABG.
How do I start?

497
00:32:06,458 --> 00:32:08,859
- Wait, what?
- I'm doing a CABG tomorrow.

498
00:32:08,961 --> 00:32:11,845
You want to scrub in,
so tell me how I start. Go.

499
00:32:11,947 --> 00:32:17,517
Um, divide the sternum, open
the thymus, incise the pericardium.

500
00:32:17,619 --> 00:32:20,037
Then take down the
mammary artery with cautery...

501
00:32:20,139 --> 00:32:24,674
- Bypass has started. Now what?
- Cross-clamp the aorta,

502
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:27,126
instill antegrade cardioplegia
followed by retrograde...

503
00:32:27,228 --> 00:32:29,257
Now, I want to
take him off bypass.

504
00:32:29,281 --> 00:32:30,814
Re-warm. Check
the flow of grafts.

505
00:32:30,916 --> 00:32:34,283
- Vent the root...
- That's enough.

506
00:32:34,385 --> 00:32:36,102
Good. I'm relieved.

507
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:39,283
You're actually more than the pretty
face you make yourself out to be.

508
00:32:39,307 --> 00:32:43,067
You knocked over a tray in my OR.
You get the answer wrong sometimes.

509
00:32:43,111 --> 00:32:47,380
Your penmanship needs work.
None of these are fireable offenses.

510
00:32:47,482 --> 00:32:51,217
But flirting, flirting into my
surgery? Batting your eyes

511
00:32:51,319 --> 00:32:54,759
while I'm inside a chest cavity? I should go
to the chief and have you fired right now.

512
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:59,826
I'm not gonna
do that, this time.

513
00:32:59,928 --> 00:33:03,713
Now, put your shirt on and
take care of these post-ops.

514
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:14,590
There you are. I've
been paging you.

515
00:33:14,693 --> 00:33:18,995
Oh, my patient needs his
worms. I'm trying to save them. Ew!

516
00:33:19,097 --> 00:33:20,614
A head.

517
00:33:20,716 --> 00:33:24,251
- What's going on?
- Oh, I, uh,
need you to take my blood.

518
00:33:24,353 --> 00:33:28,638
- For what?
- So I can get tested
for the Alzheimer's gene.

519
00:33:30,959 --> 00:33:33,576
It's time I know, one
way or the other, right?

520
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:37,430
I have a hostile uterus,
what's a little Alzheimer's, too?

521
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:41,801
OK.

522
00:33:49,611 --> 00:33:51,228
This is a lot bigger
than a baby step.

523
00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:53,980
Just do it before I
change my mind.

524
00:33:55,501 --> 00:33:56,767
OK.

525
00:34:14,018 --> 00:34:15,502
You're still here?

526
00:34:15,604 --> 00:34:17,365
I had to drop these
off before I left.

527
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:22,108
It's medication for your hand.
But you will have to see your doctor

528
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:25,044
and get it refilled when
you get back from your trip.

529
00:34:25,147 --> 00:34:29,316
- They can help you, Lila.
- I'll go. Promise.

530
00:34:29,418 --> 00:34:33,903
Oh, come on. I said I'll
go. No guilt trip, please.

531
00:34:36,041 --> 00:34:39,175
<i>Biology says that we
are who we are from birth.</i>

532
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:43,462
<i>That our DNA is set in
stone. Unchangeable.</i>

533
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:45,899
There was a complication,

534
00:34:46,001 --> 00:34:49,201
but we were able to take care of
it in surgery. You're gonna be fine.

535
00:34:49,303 --> 00:34:52,906
- As long as you quit the worms.
- I understand.

536
00:35:03,218 --> 00:35:06,753
The surgery destroyed
them all. I'm sorry.

537
00:35:12,727 --> 00:35:14,293
I'm sorry.

538
00:35:17,015 --> 00:35:22,118
Well, every experiment
has its ups and downs.

539
00:35:24,305 --> 00:35:27,569
How much time would you think
before my bowel is completely healed?

540
00:35:27,593 --> 00:35:31,811
No. If you do this again, you
could die. Do you understand that?

541
00:35:31,913 --> 00:35:34,497
Only if I make the
same mistakes. I won't.

542
00:35:34,583 --> 00:35:36,943
Decrease the quantity,
shorten the time frame...

543
00:35:36,969 --> 00:35:39,002
You know, wait, wait. Wait.

544
00:35:41,073 --> 00:35:43,193
Why would you want to put
yourself through this again?

545
00:35:47,161 --> 00:35:49,111
Because I love what I do.

546
00:35:50,149 --> 00:35:51,914
More than anything.

547
00:35:57,389 --> 00:36:01,158
You don't find something
you love that much and let it go.

548
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:06,646
You hold on to it.
Throw yourself in deeper.

549
00:36:06,748 --> 00:36:10,183
<i>Our DNA doesn't account
for all of us, though.</i>

550
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:12,952
<i>We're human.</i>

551
00:36:13,071 --> 00:36:15,822
<i>Life changes us.</i>

552
00:36:15,924 --> 00:36:19,191
Post-ops are stable and
I've ordered morning labs.

553
00:36:19,294 --> 00:36:22,595
Hm. Thanks.

554
00:36:22,697 --> 00:36:27,267
Sloan risked his life to save mine.
Even when I was sleeping with his girl.

555
00:36:27,369 --> 00:36:29,969
That's not a guy without a soul.

556
00:36:30,071 --> 00:36:34,440
Maybe he's an ass who
stares at boobs, but whatever.

557
00:36:34,542 --> 00:36:37,310
And your boobs?
You have nice boobs.

558
00:36:37,412 --> 00:36:40,575
Maybe they're lesbian boobs and
you don't like men staring at them,

559
00:36:40,599 --> 00:36:43,533
but men don't discriminate
when it comes to jugs.

560
00:36:45,504 --> 00:36:48,371
You have hot boobs.
And I stare at 'em, too.

561
00:36:48,473 --> 00:36:50,823
<i>We develop new traits.</i>

562
00:36:50,925 --> 00:36:55,327
I was... I was trying
to stop the car...

563
00:36:55,429 --> 00:36:57,680
<i>Become less territorial.</i>

564
00:37:02,603 --> 00:37:06,139
Hey, so reckless driver
turned out to be a psycho killer?

565
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,007
Failed psycho killer. Thank God.

566
00:37:08,109 --> 00:37:13,096
She was heartbroken. Her husband
left her for a younger version of herself.

567
00:37:13,198 --> 00:37:14,675
- She just...
- Lexie.

568
00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:16,582
You know what?

569
00:37:16,684 --> 00:37:21,587
I've been a total bitch to April all
day because of you, you know that?

570
00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:23,656
- What?
- I'm gonna go...

571
00:37:23,758 --> 00:37:27,293
April, just stay.

572
00:37:27,395 --> 00:37:30,547
You worry about April, you
let her have Izzie's room,

573
00:37:30,649 --> 00:37:32,882
you talk to her about
your doctors' appointments.

574
00:37:32,984 --> 00:37:36,352
And I went crazy, Alex
ditched me in a psych ward,

575
00:37:36,455 --> 00:37:41,524
Mark slept with Derek's sister.
And now I find myself relating

576
00:37:41,627 --> 00:37:45,178
to the crazy jealous lady
who drives into Laundromats.

577
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,640
April, you should go.

578
00:37:52,787 --> 00:37:58,391
Lexie, I had a
miscarriage that day.

579
00:37:58,493 --> 00:38:00,476
April was there.

580
00:38:00,578 --> 00:38:02,979
That's why she knows about
my doctor's appointment.

581
00:38:03,065 --> 00:38:06,282
And I did know that
Mark slept with Amy.

582
00:38:06,384 --> 00:38:09,569
But I didn't think you cared. I can
never tell what the hell's going on

583
00:38:09,671 --> 00:38:12,672
with you two. And as far
as the psych ward goes,

584
00:38:12,774 --> 00:38:17,977
you were not alone. I sat by your
bedside for 36 hours while you slept.

585
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:21,380
You're not crazy,
Lexie. You're a Grey.

586
00:38:24,736 --> 00:38:26,636
<i>We stop competing.</i>

587
00:38:26,738 --> 00:38:30,507
Change of plans. Mark, you're
taking me to dinner tonight.

588
00:38:30,609 --> 00:38:33,109
- What?
- We're going on a date,
you and I.

589
00:38:33,211 --> 00:38:35,239
- Alone.
- Is this to make up
for the fact

590
00:38:35,263 --> 00:38:37,931
- that you don't like me?
- You told him?

591
00:38:38,049 --> 00:38:40,199
- No, I...
- She didn't need to.

592
00:38:40,301 --> 00:38:46,172
Fine, let's go. But
you are buying.

593
00:38:46,274 --> 00:38:50,727
- Thank you.
- You, uh, still want Italian?

594
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:52,309
- Eyes on my face, Mark.
- Ah.

595
00:38:57,436 --> 00:38:59,685
<i>We learn from our mistakes.</i>

596
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:04,824
Just... Boys out! Go. Just...

597
00:39:04,926 --> 00:39:08,094
Take the towel and go.

598
00:39:08,196 --> 00:39:10,547
Seriously, if you
want the room...

599
00:39:10,649 --> 00:39:12,799
I admitted I wanted to
drive my car over you,

600
00:39:12,901 --> 00:39:16,719
so taking the room would
just make me feel worse.

601
00:39:16,821 --> 00:39:20,206
But if you put up a freaking
chore wheel, I'll kill you.

602
00:39:21,793 --> 00:39:24,661
<i>We face our greatest fears.</i>

603
00:39:25,313 --> 00:39:28,297
- Hey.
- Hi.

604
00:39:29,768 --> 00:39:32,034
Hi.

605
00:39:32,136 --> 00:39:35,872
- Hi.
- Hi. Mm!

606
00:39:37,325 --> 00:39:39,191
What?

607
00:39:39,293 --> 00:39:44,764
Um... I'm getting tested
for the Alzheimer's gene.

608
00:39:44,866 --> 00:39:48,984
- Oh... No.
- I should know.

609
00:39:49,087 --> 00:39:51,588
- We should know.
- No.

610
00:39:55,743 --> 00:39:59,311
My uterus is hostile. We
probably can't even have a baby.

611
00:39:59,431 --> 00:40:03,533
And even if we could, my brain
is probably full of Alzheimer's,

612
00:40:03,635 --> 00:40:05,935
so I wouldn't even
remember the baby's name.

613
00:40:06,037 --> 00:40:09,038
Or, even worse, I'll pass the
Alzheimer's on to the baby.

614
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:11,774
Then you'd have an
80-year-old, drooling wife

615
00:40:11,876 --> 00:40:14,277
and a 50-year-old, drooling kid.

616
00:40:14,379 --> 00:40:16,496
- I don't care.
- Derek.

617
00:40:17,232 --> 00:40:19,565
I love you. And you love me.

618
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:24,053
And whatever
happens, I don't care.

619
00:40:24,155 --> 00:40:26,339
I don't wanna know. I
mean it. I don't wanna know.

620
00:40:26,441 --> 00:40:29,475
The lab already
has my blood. So...

621
00:40:29,577 --> 00:40:32,044
Here's what we're gonna do.

622
00:40:32,146 --> 00:40:34,513
No more doctors, no more labs.

623
00:40:34,615 --> 00:40:36,866
And you and I, we
have a lot of sex.

624
00:40:36,968 --> 00:40:39,803
Maybe we make a baby, maybe not.

625
00:40:39,905 --> 00:40:42,405
Maybe you get
Alzheimer's, maybe not.

626
00:40:42,507 --> 00:40:46,843
Just... Screw the
odds, screw the science.

627
00:40:46,945 --> 00:40:48,794
Let's just live.

628
00:40:51,299 --> 00:40:53,399
Whatever happens,

629
00:40:53,501 --> 00:40:55,868
happens.

630
00:40:55,970 --> 00:40:57,437
Be me and you.

631
00:40:59,574 --> 00:41:01,040
OK?

632
00:41:07,014 --> 00:41:09,431
OK.

633
00:41:09,801 --> 00:41:10,801
OK.

634
00:41:10,869 --> 00:41:12,635
<i>For better or worse,</i>

635
00:41:14,005 --> 00:41:17,339
<i>we find ways to become
more than our biology.</i>

636
00:41:18,176 --> 00:41:20,242
<i>The risk, of course...</i>

637
00:41:20,344 --> 00:41:22,344
Cristina?

638
00:41:24,015 --> 00:41:25,982
Cristina?

639
00:41:27,468 --> 00:41:29,902
<i>Is that we can change too much.</i>

640
00:41:30,004 --> 00:41:31,904
Welcome home!

641
00:41:32,023 --> 00:41:34,424
<i>To the point we don't
recognize ourselves.</i>

642
00:41:34,526 --> 00:41:36,726
It's ours. We bought it.

643
00:41:36,828 --> 00:41:39,328
Well, I bought it, but
it's for the both of us.

644
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:42,415
<i>Finding our way
back can be difficult.</i>

645
00:41:42,517 --> 00:41:45,485
<i>There's no compass. No map.</i>

646
00:41:45,587 --> 00:41:48,620
- I don't know what to say.
- Our house has
a fire pole in it.

647
00:41:48,722 --> 00:41:52,291
- What else is there to say?
- You said this morning...

648
00:41:52,393 --> 00:41:56,495
I don't care where we live.
I really don't. But you do.

649
00:41:56,597 --> 00:41:58,431
You love this place.

650
00:41:59,867 --> 00:42:01,434
And I love you.

<i>We just have to close our eyes,</i>

652
00:42:06,157 --> 00:42:08,307
<i>take a step...</i>

653
00:42:09,261 --> 00:42:11,861
<i>and hope to God we'll get there.</i>
