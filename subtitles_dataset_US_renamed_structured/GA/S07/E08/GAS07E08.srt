1
00:00:12,746 --> 00:00:17,382
<i>The human body is a
highly pressurized system.</i>

2
00:00:19,787 --> 00:00:21,186
<i>The blood pressure</i>

3
00:00:21,288 --> 00:00:25,190
<i>measures the force of blood
pulsating through the arteries.</i>

4
00:00:25,292 --> 00:00:27,826
Great! What the hell
am I gonna do now?!

5
00:00:27,928 --> 00:00:30,073
<i>It's important to keep
this pressure regulated.</i>

6
00:00:30,097 --> 00:00:32,915
Damn it! Damn it!

7
00:00:33,017 --> 00:00:35,550
When a heart wasn't
available, I opted to continue

8
00:00:35,653 --> 00:00:37,314
with Roy Henley's
lung transplant...

9
00:00:37,338 --> 00:00:39,258
<i>Low or inadequate pressure</i>

10
00:00:39,306 --> 00:00:41,840
<i>can cause weakness or failure.</i>

11
00:00:41,942 --> 00:00:44,843
- It's all in your head.
- My name isn't on the OR board.

12
00:00:44,945 --> 00:00:46,556
I checked the schedule,
nobody wants to work with me

13
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:49,241
- because I'm not
on anybody's service.
- It's an oversight.

14
00:00:49,265 --> 00:00:51,934
- Just ask around.
- Do you know how many things
I've screwed up

15
00:00:52,035 --> 00:00:55,003
- in the last month?
- Stop it. I'm serious. Just ask around,

16
00:00:55,105 --> 00:00:58,022
and get on someone's
service and get back to work.

17
00:01:01,512 --> 00:01:03,795
You smell like you're sweating
booze. Where have you been?

18
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:06,615
- I want the weekend you had.
- What happens
in Vegas, you know?

19
00:01:06,717 --> 00:01:10,035
Hey, who's Stark? I'm supposed
to be on Stark's service today.

20
00:01:10,137 --> 00:01:12,821
Oh, me, too! He's the new Peds
attending, since Robbins left.

21
00:01:12,923 --> 00:01:17,009
Crap. I can't handle a bunch
of sick kids today. I can't do it.

22
00:01:17,111 --> 00:01:22,013
- So was it a bachelor party?
- Sh. They're talking
about Cristina.

23
00:01:22,115 --> 00:01:24,015
Oh.

24
00:01:24,118 --> 00:01:27,519
It became clear to Dr. Yang that they
were gonna need to switch modalities.

25
00:01:27,621 --> 00:01:31,556
- The patient was put on...
- - <i>It's when the pressure gets too high</i>

26
00:01:31,658 --> 00:01:35,777
<i>- that problems really occur.</i>
- And why did Dr. Yang opt to

27
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,797
use the intra-aortic balloon
pump over an RVAD?

28
00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:42,133
I, um... I can't
answer for Dr. Yang.

29
00:01:42,235 --> 00:01:45,921
- And why isn't she here?
- She, um...

30
00:01:48,526 --> 00:01:51,176
She quit. She left the program.

31
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:53,262
I'm sorry, what? She what?

32
00:01:53,364 --> 00:01:55,898
Dr. Yang cleared the balloon
pump with Dr. McQueen,

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,067
who agreed that
it was the best...

34
00:01:59,169 --> 00:02:01,519
Go back. Go back.

35
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:04,022
- Yang quit the program?
- Where have you been?

36
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,035
It's the first I've heard of it.
Hunt, what the hell happened?

37
00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:08,526
- She told the chief she quit.
- Richard.

38
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:11,847
- If we could finish the presentation...
- - I have a question.

39
00:02:11,949 --> 00:02:15,111
Can you tell us about your decision to
put Dr. Yang in charge of this patient?

40
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:19,838
- Sorry?
- But she didn't
"quit" quit, right?

41
00:02:21,675 --> 00:02:24,075
Grey?

42
00:02:24,178 --> 00:02:27,095
You're joined at the
hip, what'd she say?

43
00:02:27,197 --> 00:02:29,080
She hasn't spoken
to me about it.

44
00:02:29,182 --> 00:02:31,111
<i>If the pressure
continues to increase,</i>

45
00:02:31,135 --> 00:02:33,235
<i>a closer examination
is called for.</i>

46
00:02:33,337 --> 00:02:35,370
Stop looking at
me. Look up there.

47
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:39,525
Does Torres know
anything about this?

48
00:02:39,627 --> 00:02:42,928
- I'm calling Torres.
- Can we please just...

49
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:45,374
I guess I'm asking you, why
did you choose to put Dr. Yang

50
00:02:45,398 --> 00:02:47,476
- under so much pressure that day?
- - I didn't.

51
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:52,253
I intended the opposite. I gave her a
simple pre-op checklist on a stable patient.

52
00:02:52,355 --> 00:02:54,322
Stable patient?

53
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:57,692
- The patient almost died twice.
- I couldn't have
seen that coming.

54
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:02,798
I'm sorry, is this a, uh,
a patient presentation,

55
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,683
or a post-mortem on Dr. Yang?

56
00:03:04,785 --> 00:03:07,202
Well, you saved the patient.

57
00:03:07,304 --> 00:03:09,049
<i>Because it's the best indicator</i>

58
00:03:09,073 --> 00:03:12,090
<i>that something is
going terribly wrong.</i>

59
00:03:54,351 --> 00:03:56,751
Hey, Mark.

60
00:03:56,854 --> 00:04:01,756
No, no, I was, um, I was
actually on my way out. What's up?

61
00:04:04,628 --> 00:04:05,860
She what?

62
00:04:05,962 --> 00:04:07,696
I don't know what
Shepherd's problem is.

63
00:04:07,798 --> 00:04:10,799
What the hell was that?
How is she doing? Is she...?

64
00:04:10,901 --> 00:04:13,902
We're... I don't know.
She's... We're good. We're fine.

65
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:16,838
It's like nothing's changed. Yet
she refuses to talk about work.

66
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:19,140
I bring up work,
and she goes blank.

67
00:04:19,242 --> 00:04:21,710
Altman, Hunt, emergent
patient, ten minutes out.

68
00:04:21,812 --> 00:04:24,207
- Can you meet me
in the VIP wing?
- VIP wing? Who is it?

69
00:04:24,231 --> 00:04:25,597
You'll find out
when we get there.

70
00:04:27,417 --> 00:04:32,170
Listen, Hunt, I'm required to send a
letter to the American Board of Surgery

71
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,956
declaring that Dr. Yang has
officially left the residency program.

72
00:04:35,058 --> 00:04:37,975
I have to let them know. I'm
asking you, is there any reason

73
00:04:38,077 --> 00:04:39,655
I need to hold off on
sending that letter?

74
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:41,662
- Yes!
- Yes!

75
00:04:41,765 --> 00:04:44,248
Please, don't mail it. Just
give us a little more time.

76
00:04:47,253 --> 00:04:49,354
OK. Let's go.

77
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:55,710
- Grey, who are you with today?
- Shepherd.

78
00:04:55,812 --> 00:04:59,230
Damn it! I've already blown it
with Shepherd, I can't ask him.

79
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:00,765
Uh...

80
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:03,234
Bailey, I haven't
blown it with her yet.

81
00:05:03,337 --> 00:05:05,415
- Thinks no one
wants to work with him.
- Are they saying that,

82
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:07,216
- or are you saying that?
- Who are you with again?

83
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:11,409
- Karev. Uh, I mean Stark.
- No, you meant Karev.

84
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:12,911
And you don't want to go there.

85
00:05:13,013 --> 00:05:14,423
You don't know where I'm going.

86
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:15,875
He's right, don't
want to go there.

87
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:17,582
I'm not going anywhere!

88
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:20,818
He's not the guy for
you. OK? Trust me.

89
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,521
And don't be paranoid.
Trust me on that, too.

90
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:29,187
Oh, but it's OK
for you to go there?

91
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:31,963
I'm a guy, I live there.

92
00:05:32,066 --> 00:05:35,100
I gotta find Bailey.

93
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:43,591
Hello? Cristina?

94
00:05:44,728 --> 00:05:47,428
Oh, hey. Hello?

95
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:49,080
Hello!

96
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:53,935
- Hello!
- Ah!

97
00:05:55,973 --> 00:05:59,474
- Uh, what are you doing here?
- I'm not back until next week.

98
00:05:59,576 --> 00:06:01,943
So it's true? You guys
broke up? She's in Africa?

99
00:06:02,045 --> 00:06:04,405
OK. Sloan told me that you quit.

100
00:06:04,498 --> 00:06:07,849
Hey! What are you doing?

101
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:12,871
- This! Go away!
- OK, this is disturbing.

102
00:06:12,973 --> 00:06:16,641
Hey, stop!

103
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:22,580
Look, I was unpacking,
but then I didn't enjoy it.

104
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:24,765
- What are you doing?
- What do you mean?

105
00:06:24,868 --> 00:06:27,096
You don't have a job to go to.
You don't have a girlfriend telling you

106
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,715
you have to go to Africa. You're
completely free, do whatever you want.

107
00:06:29,739 --> 00:06:31,423
The world is your
oyster. Make lemonade!

108
00:06:31,525 --> 00:06:34,045
I'm trying. I was gonna
get my hair cut today.

109
00:06:34,111 --> 00:06:38,112
Like, make a radical change.
But then I thought, hm...

110
00:06:38,214 --> 00:06:41,749
maybe you shouldn't do radical
things right after a blond woman

111
00:06:41,852 --> 00:06:45,520
has ripped your heart out of
your chest and stomped on it.

112
00:06:45,622 --> 00:06:47,862
What are you...? Oh, my
God! What are you doing?!

113
00:06:47,891 --> 00:06:50,158
Are you insane?!

114
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:52,310
Let's make lemonade.

115
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,641
Oh, my God.

116
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:04,088
Uh... Ninety-seven-point-six.
Stick out your tongue.

117
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:07,859
- Ow! Cut it out.
- We'll have fun today.

118
00:07:07,961 --> 00:07:12,130
Stark's got a four-month-old biliary
atresia patient who just found a donor.

119
00:07:12,232 --> 00:07:16,117
A liver transplant on an infant?

120
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:18,398
Enough with the
damn ping-pong balls!

121
00:07:18,422 --> 00:07:23,408
- Jerk-face!
- Whoa! Inside
voices here, please.

122
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:26,777
So you must be Dr. Karev.
You missed my rounds today.

123
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:30,364
Ugh! Sorry I... I
had car trouble.

124
00:07:30,466 --> 00:07:34,920
Well, there's a classic. So, what,
you're here just to yell at my patients?

125
00:07:35,022 --> 00:07:38,473
I'm sorry. Look, Dr. Stark,

126
00:07:38,575 --> 00:07:42,810
I am feeling very sick today. So
I think since you have Kepner...

127
00:07:42,913 --> 00:07:45,630
Well, let's see here.

128
00:07:45,732 --> 00:07:48,199
No fever. You don't
seem to be vomiting.

129
00:07:48,285 --> 00:07:50,396
- You retaining control
of your bowels?
- Ew.

130
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:54,122
- Yes.
- Well, since hangovers
are not contagious,

131
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:55,556
I'd say you're working.

132
00:07:55,676 --> 00:08:00,578
And you can start by
prepping my atresia kid.

133
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:04,716
She's only a few months
old, so try not to be a jerk-face.

134
00:08:08,305 --> 00:08:09,554
Give me that!

135
00:08:13,193 --> 00:08:16,644
Dr. Webber? Ronald Dace, State
Department. We spoke on the phone.

136
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:18,880
- These your surgeons?
- Uh, yes, this is Doctor...

137
00:08:18,982 --> 00:08:21,911
Right now, we need to limit access
to this area to only essential personnel.

138
00:08:21,935 --> 00:08:24,029
- Why is that necessary?
- - No one can know this man

139
00:08:24,053 --> 00:08:26,754
is being hospitalized. No one
can know he's in the country.

140
00:08:33,981 --> 00:08:35,329
Everyone, stop!

141
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:38,166
Give me the paddles.
I need a reading.

142
00:08:40,987 --> 00:08:43,455
- Stay back.
- He's in v-fib, charge to 200!

143
00:08:46,843 --> 00:08:50,445
And from a global perspective,
it would be great if he didn't die.

144
00:08:50,547 --> 00:08:53,848
Clear.

145
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:59,103
Clear!

146
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:01,105
They faxed more of his records.

147
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:05,260
- These are all in Arabic.
- Clear!

148
00:09:05,361 --> 00:09:07,873
- There was a car accident?
- The emir's car
was hit by a truck

149
00:09:07,897 --> 00:09:10,025
- as he was leaving the meeting.
- What's he doing in Seattle?

150
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:13,150
He's not. Let it suffice
to say, if he dies,

151
00:09:13,253 --> 00:09:15,019
we've got a serious
international incident.

152
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:18,017
Not to mention, his people are supposed
to see their first elections, right?

153
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:20,135
- I'm not at liberty to...
- Unless he dies,

154
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:22,510
in which case the door is
open for Al-Qaeda to move in

155
00:09:22,612 --> 00:09:24,674
and then your secret
meeting was for nothing.

156
00:09:24,698 --> 00:09:27,298
You don't just skip to
the crossword, do you?

157
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,545
- I worked in that
neck of the woods.
- I know, Dr. Altman.

158
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,970
Three years in Baghdad.
Two years in Landstuhl.

159
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:34,389
- Wow, you guys are fast.
- We are.

160
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:39,360
Our best outcome here is we get him
stable enough to be put on a plane home.

161
00:09:39,462 --> 00:09:42,246
Our best outcome is we save him.

162
00:09:42,348 --> 00:09:45,762
He takes two medications, one for high
blood pressure, one for his cholesterol.

163
00:09:45,786 --> 00:09:47,997
Uh, he was hospitalized
late last year for exhaustion.

164
00:09:48,021 --> 00:09:50,649
- Did he receive
any treatment then?
- No, just rest.

165
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:53,086
Working too hard.
He works very hard.

166
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:55,104
He has a wife, four children.

167
00:09:55,128 --> 00:09:57,611
Five, if you count me.

168
00:09:57,714 --> 00:10:00,966
He's more than my
boss, he's been, um...

169
00:10:01,068 --> 00:10:03,518
He's given me
everything. So, please...

170
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:05,436
We'll do everything we can.

171
00:10:08,491 --> 00:10:12,777
- He's in v-fib! Alright, charge to 300!
- Clear!

172
00:10:18,834 --> 00:10:22,336
- We'll bring your baby up soon.
- Lisa. Her name is Lisa.

173
00:10:22,439 --> 00:10:25,006
The donor was an adult, so
the liver will actually be split

174
00:10:25,108 --> 00:10:26,668
- between your baby...
- Lisa.

175
00:10:26,743 --> 00:10:29,477
Sorry, we read that
if the doctor knows

176
00:10:29,579 --> 00:10:33,865
your baby's name, it helps you to kind of
bond with her. We read that's important.

177
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:36,600
Will Dr. Stark be
splitting the liver in situ?

178
00:10:36,703 --> 00:10:38,797
We that know ex
vivo takes less time,

179
00:10:38,821 --> 00:10:44,208
but we also read that in
situ gives better results?

180
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,460
We're not trying to tell
you how to do your job.

181
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:50,231
No, of course not. Please don't
apologize. We'll find out for you.

182
00:10:51,968 --> 00:10:54,552
One second.

183
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,899
- Blow up as many
of those as you can.
- Dr. Stark.

184
00:10:56,923 --> 00:11:00,040
- You got it. You got it.
- Dr. Stark?

185
00:11:00,143 --> 00:11:03,778
Can you come talk to the Collises,
please? They've got a lot of questions.

186
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,247
Yeah, I gotta check on
that kid's harvest team.

187
00:11:06,349 --> 00:11:08,699
- Did you ever hang glide?
- What? I... No.

188
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:10,980
It's apparently a very good
way to become a liver donor.

189
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:15,940
Sir, are you splitting the liver in the
body, or ex vivo? Parents want to know.

190
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:19,811
OK. Those folks have been
spending a little too much time

191
00:11:19,912 --> 00:11:23,481
consulting Dr. Internet.
Listen, just hold their hands.

192
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:27,785
Let them feel smart. Tell them
I'm busy getting their baby a liver.

193
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,089
Her name's Lisa.

194
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:36,094
I said I don't need any
help. I've got an easy day.

195
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:37,990
Two laparoscopic
surgeries. I can't use you.

196
00:11:38,014 --> 00:11:40,510
- Maybe I could...
- I'm sorry, ma'am,
I can't admit you.

197
00:11:40,534 --> 00:11:43,717
You don't need to admit me.
I'll just walk in there myself.

198
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,219
I do it all the time.

199
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:50,108
Uh, Chief Webber
paged me in there.

200
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:53,244
- I'm sorry, ma'am.
- Well, who's in there?

201
00:11:53,346 --> 00:11:55,479
Is it the president?
Or the vice president?

202
00:11:56,316 --> 00:11:58,249
- Is it Bono?
- Bono?

203
00:11:58,351 --> 00:12:00,184
- Ma'am, I'm sorry...
- Bailey.

204
00:12:00,286 --> 00:12:02,646
Can you take my patients
today? I got a situation in here.

205
00:12:02,705 --> 00:12:04,956
- Oh, of course, sir.
- Louise Cortez is a readmit

206
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:09,443
after surgery for chronic pancreatitis.
CT showed a pancreatic fistula.

207
00:12:09,546 --> 00:12:12,529
- And she spiked
a fever this morning.
- Right. Sir...

208
00:12:12,632 --> 00:12:15,550
- You put in a drain?
- Yes. Just keep a close eye.

209
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:20,705
Sir! Is it Bono?

210
00:12:24,644 --> 00:12:27,562
Come on, Avery, I can use you.

211
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:29,697
OK, but I don't understand,
I'm on your service.

212
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:31,444
I don't need you. The
craniotomy's been cancelled.

213
00:12:31,468 --> 00:12:32,862
I don't have anything
for the rest of the day.

214
00:12:32,886 --> 00:12:34,813
- So, what am I supposed
to do now?
- Go study.

215
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:36,704
- Study what?
- I don't care, Lexie.

216
00:12:36,806 --> 00:12:40,641
Go somewhere else. Oh, my God.

217
00:12:40,744 --> 00:12:45,196
- How do we have time for this?
- We have to make time for this.

218
00:12:45,298 --> 00:12:46,809
- Should I call her?
- Call who?

219
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:48,699
- Cristina!
- Why?

220
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:50,363
Because she quit and I feel
like I should do something.

221
00:12:50,387 --> 00:12:52,737
That's not your fault. You
didn't do anything wrong,

222
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:55,240
no matter what she says. OK?

223
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:58,175
- You just need
to make time for this.
- But...

224
00:12:58,261 --> 00:13:00,945
Oh, my God. Lexie.

225
00:13:01,047 --> 00:13:04,465
- What?!
- I'm looking
for Dr. Meredith Grey.

226
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:11,422
What did you do?

227
00:13:20,066 --> 00:13:21,649
How's it going?

228
00:13:21,751 --> 00:13:25,736
- Can I see?
- Fantastic, shut up.

229
00:13:25,838 --> 00:13:28,706
OK... You know what you need?

230
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:33,628
To get this place done? You need
to throw a housewarming party.

231
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:35,006
Put a little pressure
on yourself.

232
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:37,131
We should throw a
housewarming party!

233
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:39,533
Oh, my God!

234
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:45,223
- Oh, my God. No!
- Tonight! I'll text everyone!

235
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:47,186
- No!
- Yes! I have
several credit cards

236
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:48,821
- and nothing to do.
- OK, this is not what I wanted.

237
00:13:48,845 --> 00:13:51,662
I look... I look injured.
Do you even cut hair?

238
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:54,699
- I need furniture!
- Look at my hair!

239
00:13:55,951 --> 00:13:57,996
Yeah. I sort of can't
believe you let me do that.

240
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:00,571
- Cristina!
- It's OK, we'll go to the mall!

241
00:14:01,274 --> 00:14:02,656
You might want a hat.

242
00:14:03,777 --> 00:14:06,144
Clear!

243
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:09,497
We need to get
him to a cath lab.

244
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:10,793
If he'd stop coding long enough.

245
00:14:10,817 --> 00:14:12,216
I'm inserting a pacemaker.

246
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:15,085
- You paged?
- Yeah, Grey, grab
me a pacemaker kit.

247
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:18,100
Hey, Hunt, you're throwing a
housewarming party tonight?

248
00:14:18,124 --> 00:14:19,818
- Tonight? I am?
- Well, your wife is.

249
00:14:19,842 --> 00:14:22,977
- That's a good sign, right?
- It's a weird sign.

250
00:14:23,096 --> 00:14:26,597
But maybe it's an opportunity. I
mean, maybe I could talk to her.

251
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:30,200
Better yet, maybe
you could, Grey.

252
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:32,215
We all could. I mean,
it's gonna be hard for her

253
00:14:32,239 --> 00:14:34,605
to walk out of a
room at her own party.

254
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:37,991
- How bad is it?
- I'll tell you when I know.

255
00:14:38,093 --> 00:14:39,438
Maybe a little less
party planning...

256
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:41,039
Hey, I don't tell you how to...

257
00:14:41,063 --> 00:14:43,731
- polish your sunglasses.
- Look, between you and me,

258
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:47,118
he's a good man, and it'd be a
shame if something like this screwed up

259
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,348
- what he was trying to do.
- Wow. Every time I talk to you,

260
00:14:49,372 --> 00:14:52,006
I feel a little more relaxed.

261
00:14:52,108 --> 00:14:54,776
The last thing Cristina
wants is to talk to me.

262
00:14:54,877 --> 00:14:56,422
I have to just give
her some space.

263
00:14:56,446 --> 00:14:57,540
We don't have time
to give her space.

264
00:14:57,564 --> 00:14:59,108
She's gonna be locked
out of this program.

265
00:14:59,132 --> 00:15:02,149
And I do not believe that,
that is what she wants.

266
00:15:02,251 --> 00:15:04,852
I mean, do you think
that's what she wants?

267
00:15:04,954 --> 00:15:07,471
I'm asking you, Grey.

268
00:15:10,593 --> 00:15:13,761
I still don't understand
what I'm doing back here.

269
00:15:13,863 --> 00:15:16,164
Dr. Webber said
something about a fist?

270
00:15:16,265 --> 00:15:19,800
A fistula. It's a complication
from your surgery

271
00:15:19,903 --> 00:15:21,769
that's leaking pancreatic fluid.

272
00:15:21,871 --> 00:15:24,772
The drain takes the
fluid out of your body

273
00:15:24,874 --> 00:15:27,107
so it won't go where
it's not supposed to.

274
00:15:27,209 --> 00:15:29,010
OK...

275
00:15:29,111 --> 00:15:32,696
The pancreatic fluid is
made to digest your food.

276
00:15:32,798 --> 00:15:36,800
If it leaks in your body, it starts
to digest your other organs.

277
00:15:36,902 --> 00:15:39,454
- That wouldn't be good.
- Exactly.

278
00:15:39,556 --> 00:15:42,289
But not to worry,
yours is looking just fine.

279
00:15:42,391 --> 00:15:44,036
I just want to keep a
close eye on you, OK?

280
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:46,377
Seems like I just was
home, and here I am again.

281
00:15:46,479 --> 00:15:49,546
- You know, I say
that every morning.
- Dr. Bailey, the OR's ready.

282
00:15:49,632 --> 00:15:54,235
OK. Um, Ms. Cortez, your
temperature's still a little high,

283
00:15:54,337 --> 00:15:58,005
so you just rest and we'll
get you home in no time.

284
00:15:58,107 --> 00:16:00,424
OK.

285
00:16:02,177 --> 00:16:05,145
- OK, you're not scrubbing in.
- I'm not?

286
00:16:05,248 --> 00:16:09,183
No. Watch Mrs. Cortez. If the fluid in
her drain changes color, you page me.

287
00:16:09,285 --> 00:16:11,585
If her fever goes up
one digit, you page me.

288
00:16:11,687 --> 00:16:14,722
- 'Cause the fever could mean...
- An abscess, early sepsis,

289
00:16:14,824 --> 00:16:18,259
pneumonia, any number of nasty things.
Remember your first rule of residency:

290
00:16:18,361 --> 00:16:20,044
"Eat when you can,
sleep when you can..."

291
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:22,913
"Don't screw with the pancreas."

292
00:16:23,016 --> 00:16:25,383
So much for my easy day.

293
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:29,520
Nice anastomoses.

294
00:16:29,622 --> 00:16:31,755
No leaks.

295
00:16:31,858 --> 00:16:34,192
- How are we doing? Are we good?
- It's not...

296
00:16:34,294 --> 00:16:38,011
It's not quite fitting, is it? There's not
enough room in the peritoneal cavity

297
00:16:38,114 --> 00:16:40,034
- for the graft.
- The liver's too big?

298
00:16:40,066 --> 00:16:42,700
Or the baby's too small.

299
00:16:42,802 --> 00:16:45,469
BP's 64 over 40.

300
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:47,098
It's compressing
the hepatic vessels.

301
00:16:47,122 --> 00:16:50,362
Sponge. No, no, no. Larger,
larger, larger. There we go.

302
00:16:50,393 --> 00:16:55,012
Let's get this sponge up under
there, take the pressure off the vessels.

303
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:58,065
And... Yeah, that's
doing the trick there.

304
00:16:58,167 --> 00:17:00,717
All right. I think we're done.

305
00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:03,704
- But the liver's not gonna fit.
- We're not gonna
close her up today.

306
00:17:03,806 --> 00:17:07,891
Just wrap her. This
happens with adult split livers.

307
00:17:07,977 --> 00:17:11,913
You just gotta sit tight and hope
that the swelling goes down enough

308
00:17:12,014 --> 00:17:14,276
- so you can close her up.
- Well, how long will that take?

309
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:18,302
As long as it takes, Karev.
Thank you all, great work.

310
00:17:21,357 --> 00:17:24,625
This graft is big. The swelling
is going to take a lot to go down.

311
00:17:24,727 --> 00:17:27,462
How long can it stay like
that with that sponge in her?

312
00:17:27,564 --> 00:17:30,444
- I don't know.
- - Isn't it gonna start to deteriorate?

313
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,679
She could get infected. And what if
the swelling doesn't go down enough?

314
00:17:33,703 --> 00:17:36,470
The liver will die and she'll
be back on the donor's list.

315
00:17:36,572 --> 00:17:40,291
- Geez, how is this a solution?
- It's not.

316
00:17:47,917 --> 00:17:51,285
Um, how can you not talk to Meredith
about this? She's your best friend.

317
00:17:51,387 --> 00:17:54,321
- Ooh, I love that lamp.
- You can't just
cut yourself off

318
00:17:54,423 --> 00:17:57,391
from a person, pretend your
whole relationship never happened.

319
00:17:57,493 --> 00:18:02,363
I mean, you can, but it makes
you a heartless, soulless monster

320
00:18:02,465 --> 00:18:05,366
- who I thought I knew,
but really didn't.
- With wheels on her shoes.

321
00:18:05,468 --> 00:18:09,470
Oh, God, how was I OK with that?
I used to be a lot cooler than that.

322
00:18:09,572 --> 00:18:12,606
- I was a lot cooler
when I was single.
- You were hardly ever single.

323
00:18:12,709 --> 00:18:16,243
I know. I know.

324
00:18:16,346 --> 00:18:19,229
I'm actually excited to
spend time on my own.

325
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,195
OK, I thought we were
going to a hair salon.

326
00:18:23,219 --> 00:18:25,414
- Next. We're doing me now.
- Can I help you find something?

327
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:27,588
Yes. I will take that.

328
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:30,490
- That sofa?
- That room.

329
00:18:30,593 --> 00:18:33,928
All of it. I'll take it. You do
same day delivery, right?

330
00:18:36,099 --> 00:18:38,932
- Great.
- So it went very well.

331
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:40,846
Baby looks good,
liver looks good.

332
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:44,121
- And we can all
exhale a little bit.
- When can we see her?

333
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:46,284
Soon. We'd like to
keep an eye on her.

334
00:18:46,308 --> 00:18:48,937
There's a little bit of swelling,
and I wanna see that go down,

335
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:51,929
- but, uh, we'll let you know.
- Thank you.

336
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:55,699
Thank you so much,
Dr. Stark. Thank you.

337
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:58,302
Yeah. My pleasure entirely.

338
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:01,883
You aren't gonna tell
them any more than that?

339
00:19:01,907 --> 00:19:03,752
What would you want
me to tell them, Karev?

340
00:19:03,776 --> 00:19:06,710
That there's a chance of infection,
that if the liver doesn't conform,

341
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:09,525
they could be back on the donor's
list? I mean, they're smart people,

342
00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:10,692
they want to know
what could go wrong.

343
00:19:10,716 --> 00:19:12,128
Make them more
worried than they are?

344
00:19:12,152 --> 00:19:15,436
I think you're not
worried enough!

345
00:19:15,538 --> 00:19:19,590
- Tell me a better solution.
- I, uh...

346
00:19:19,692 --> 00:19:23,760
Can you give me
a better solution?

347
00:19:23,863 --> 00:19:26,897
- No.
- Well, then
keep your mouth shut,

348
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:31,551
and go do something you can
do. You can start with my post-ops.

349
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:35,772
You tried.

350
00:19:39,395 --> 00:19:44,098
Ow! OK, since when is it OK
to shoot people in this hospital?

351
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,862
- Now Bailey's
given up on me, too.
- You're on her service!

352
00:19:46,886 --> 00:19:49,920
- Why are you still
freaking out?
- No, Bailey's in surgery.

353
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:52,834
She trusts me to watch a post-op
drip fluid in a bag every ten minutes.

354
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:57,377
- Ow!
- Inappropriate! You should relax.

355
00:19:57,479 --> 00:20:00,130
You get an easy day, you
take it. Shepherd didn't need me,

356
00:20:00,233 --> 00:20:02,600
so I took a nap in
the research library.

357
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:04,435
Give me... Give it to me.

358
00:20:05,855 --> 00:20:07,922
- Jerk-face.
- He's having a rough day.

359
00:20:08,024 --> 00:20:11,091
- New Robbins is no Robbins.
- Check this out.

360
00:20:11,193 --> 00:20:13,661
- Armed escort to get a yogurt.
- OK, who is it? Is it Bono?

361
00:20:13,763 --> 00:20:15,240
It's totally Bono. It's
all over the hospital.

362
00:20:15,264 --> 00:20:19,283
- It's not Bono.
- Are you going
to Cristina's tonight?

363
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:20,868
I don't know.

364
00:20:22,705 --> 00:20:24,855
OK!

365
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:26,790
- Not OK.
- It's addicting.

366
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,937
Put it away before my guy
wrestles you to the ground.

367
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:30,561
- Give me that.
- No.

368
00:20:30,663 --> 00:20:33,547
- Give me the ball.
- No. Get...

369
00:20:36,352 --> 00:20:38,618
- What's his problem?
- He's having a rough day.

370
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:43,207
Jeez, I'm coming.

371
00:20:54,887 --> 00:20:59,189
The Emir's cath confirmed that he
has a tear in one of his coronary arteries.

372
00:20:59,292 --> 00:21:01,236
We've stabilized him
with a balloon pump,

373
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:04,462
but I am gonna have to perform
open heart surgery to repair the tear.

374
00:21:04,547 --> 00:21:08,065
Doctor, doctor, please.

375
00:21:08,167 --> 00:21:10,217
- Was the tear in his...?
- Quiet, please.

376
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:11,986
Was the tear in
his artery an injury

377
00:21:12,087 --> 00:21:13,732
- sustained in the car accident?
- There is no way...

378
00:21:13,756 --> 00:21:17,591
- Doctor, don't answer that.
- There's no way of knowing

379
00:21:17,694 --> 00:21:20,460
- if that was the cause.
-

380
00:21:20,562 --> 00:21:23,496
Can we have assurances
that your finest surgeons

381
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:25,911
- will be operating on His Highness?
- - Yes.

382
00:21:25,935 --> 00:21:29,069
These are the chiefs of my
cardio-thoracic and trauma departments.

383
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:36,076
Sorry. He was asking
your State Department.

384
00:21:36,178 --> 00:21:38,478
He didn't mean the finest
surgeons in this hospital.

385
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:41,082
Which is why you might be
more comfortable travelling

386
00:21:41,184 --> 00:21:44,718
to your own country,
where he can...

387
00:21:46,789 --> 00:21:50,808
All right, quiet! Quiet, please!
Quiet, please. Thank you.

388
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:55,179
I understand that there are a lot
of concerns and agendas here,

389
00:21:55,281 --> 00:21:58,626
but we all have the same goal,
and that is to see this man live.

390
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:02,202
Now, we are out of time, which
means we are out of options.

391
00:22:02,304 --> 00:22:04,988
I am your only shot,
and you have to take me.

392
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:07,775
I can only say that if
you knew me better,

393
00:22:07,877 --> 00:22:10,294
you'd feel pretty good
about your chances.

394
00:22:10,396 --> 00:22:13,097
Dr. Hunt and I are
going to operate.

395
00:22:13,199 --> 00:22:16,433
And we will update
you as soon as we can.

396
00:22:20,122 --> 00:22:22,022
Good luck.

397
00:22:27,547 --> 00:22:29,913
You have to tell them to stop.

398
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:33,517
- Tell them they can't operate.
- Why? What's the problem?

399
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:39,640
Come with me.

400
00:22:39,742 --> 00:22:42,023
He didn't want anyone to
know. He made me swear.

401
00:22:42,061 --> 00:22:44,372
- Just tell him
what you told us.
- Four months ago,

402
00:22:44,396 --> 00:22:46,975
the Emir was diagnosed with
an unruptured cerebral aneurysm

403
00:22:46,999 --> 00:22:49,144
- in his left temporal lobe.
- He's in CT now?

404
00:22:49,168 --> 00:22:51,935
His first neuro came up clean,
but now he's got a blown pupil.

405
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:54,621
- So we think it's burst.
- Scans should be up by now.

406
00:22:54,723 --> 00:22:57,808
I swore to him, I wouldn't say
anything until after the election.

407
00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:01,095
I'm still not sure I should have told
you. I might be costing him everything.

408
00:23:01,196 --> 00:23:02,591
You're trying to save his life.

409
00:23:02,615 --> 00:23:04,631
He's trying to save
seven million lives.

410
00:23:04,733 --> 00:23:06,845
To make it so seven million
people can walk the street

411
00:23:06,869 --> 00:23:09,736
without the fear of being
murdered by the extremists.

412
00:23:09,838 --> 00:23:14,942
He doesn't, um... He risks his life
every time he steps out his door.

413
00:23:15,043 --> 00:23:19,563
You're trying to protect him too,
and I'm sure he'll understand that.

414
00:23:23,452 --> 00:23:25,492
- He was headed to surgery?
- Yeah, we're going on

415
00:23:25,554 --> 00:23:29,857
- dissected coronary artery.
- - Yeah, that aneurysm's blown.

416
00:23:29,959 --> 00:23:31,870
- Damn it. That's a huge bleed.
- Well, not surprising.

417
00:23:31,894 --> 00:23:35,189
He was shocked seven times and given
a blood thinner, which is unfortunate.

418
00:23:35,213 --> 00:23:37,314
He presented like an MI. I
treated him appropriately.

419
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:38,576
I couldn't have
seen this coming.

420
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,062
You've been saying
that a lot today.

421
00:23:40,086 --> 00:23:41,947
You know what, Shepherd?
I don't need crap from you.

422
00:23:41,971 --> 00:23:44,182
Apparently, I hold the whole fate
of the Middle East in my hands.

423
00:23:44,206 --> 00:23:47,252
Apparently, now I do, too. Book an OR.
We'll gonna have to work simultaneously.

424
00:23:47,276 --> 00:23:48,592
Can't wait.

425
00:23:59,638 --> 00:24:02,406
Cristina's having a
party? Cristina Yang?

426
00:24:02,508 --> 00:24:06,293
Yeah, I know, but I'm gonna go.
We're all gonna go and talk to her.

427
00:24:06,395 --> 00:24:10,180
You should come, too. You quit
once. You walked away and came back.

428
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:11,793
So maybe you have
something to say that could help.

429
00:24:11,817 --> 00:24:15,035
- No.
- No?

430
00:24:15,137 --> 00:24:18,438
Do you remember when you came
out to talk to me about coming back?

431
00:24:18,541 --> 00:24:21,653
Do you remember when I hit your
engagement ring with a baseball bat?

432
00:24:21,677 --> 00:24:25,329
- Oh, that was a great day.
- She's already lashing out.

433
00:24:25,431 --> 00:24:28,865
Don't go and try and confront her.
No intervention of Cristina Yang.

434
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:31,769
Do you hear me? It's a bad idea.

435
00:24:35,774 --> 00:24:37,073
What are you sterilizing?

436
00:24:40,963 --> 00:24:42,245
You're kidding me.

437
00:24:44,466 --> 00:24:47,701
- What was so important?
- Uh...

438
00:24:49,338 --> 00:24:51,316
Sir, I was out of line earlier.

439
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:55,392
But I think I found a
solution for Lisa Collis's liver.

440
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:58,429
- What is that,
a ping-pong ball?
- It's the perfect shape

441
00:24:58,531 --> 00:25:00,748
to keep the liver from
compressing her blood vessels.

442
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:06,153
It's made of celluloid, not plastic, so
it won't break down, like a sponge will.

443
00:25:06,255 --> 00:25:08,249
It's gas-sterilized, so
there's little risk of infection.

444
00:25:08,273 --> 00:25:12,292
You could leave it in there forever.
Her liver will just grow around it.

445
00:25:12,394 --> 00:25:13,827
I think it's...

446
00:25:15,848 --> 00:25:18,299
- You think it won't work?
- No...

447
00:25:18,401 --> 00:25:21,101
I was thinking I left
you to do my post-ops,

448
00:25:21,203 --> 00:25:23,486
and here I find you
playing with balls.

449
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:27,057
I don't know, Karev.

450
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:29,893
Am I gonna have to talk
to your chief about you?

451
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:32,596
Yeah. Right.

452
00:25:38,354 --> 00:25:42,105
I want it sort of like bad-ass, you
know? A little dangerous, unpredictable.

453
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:45,876
- Did you bring a picture?
- Mm... It's more of a feeling.

454
00:25:45,978 --> 00:25:49,847
What do they do all day, the
mall people? Look at them.

455
00:25:49,949 --> 00:25:53,750
They move so
slowly. They all mosey.

456
00:25:53,852 --> 00:25:56,036
- Look!
- Yeah, I can't turn my head.

457
00:25:56,154 --> 00:26:00,740
Do they just eat things and buy things
and complain about their breakups?

458
00:26:00,842 --> 00:26:03,610
- Yes.
- Fantastic. Look at that lady.

459
00:26:03,712 --> 00:26:08,565
She's just gonna eat that
pretzel. That's all she's gonna do.

460
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:10,478
So, what are you gonna do? You're
just gonna become a mall person?

461
00:26:10,502 --> 00:26:12,519
- Shop and eat?
- This yogurt's pretty good.

462
00:26:12,621 --> 00:26:14,137
I'm serious.

463
00:26:18,227 --> 00:26:20,227
I'm getting a pretzel.

464
00:26:22,665 --> 00:26:25,466
- Avery, how's our patient?
- No change.

465
00:26:25,567 --> 00:26:27,229
That's what I like to hear.
I'm going into my colon.

466
00:26:27,253 --> 00:26:29,414
So you still don't
want me to scrub in?

467
00:26:29,438 --> 00:26:32,639
- No, I need you to watch...
- Ms. Cortez.

468
00:26:32,741 --> 00:26:34,752
Right. Like I said, no change.

469
00:26:34,776 --> 00:26:37,478
Avery, I need you where I
need you. I don't have time.

470
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:39,863
No, ma'am, that's fine.

471
00:26:41,867 --> 00:26:43,533
I get it.

472
00:26:43,635 --> 00:26:45,580
I'm saying with this letter,
there's a timeframe now.

473
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:47,804
You're content to stand
back and watch Cristina

474
00:26:47,906 --> 00:26:53,677
- lose her spot in this program?
- I'm saying an intervention
is not a good plan. Suction.

475
00:26:53,762 --> 00:26:55,973
It's not an intervention,
Shepherd. We just thought,

476
00:26:55,997 --> 00:26:57,909
- since we were all together...
- Torsades!

477
00:26:57,933 --> 00:27:00,234
Damn it. He's in v-fib.
Shepherd, I need you to stop.

478
00:27:00,336 --> 00:27:02,747
- We have to shock him.
- - No, wait, I'm right in the middle of...

479
00:27:02,771 --> 00:27:04,583
- Internal paddles.
- Charge to ten.

480
00:27:04,607 --> 00:27:06,273
Hold on, hold on!

481
00:27:09,929 --> 00:27:11,644
Shepherd!

482
00:27:15,017 --> 00:27:17,017
OK. Clear!

483
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:21,905
Sinus tach.

484
00:27:24,143 --> 00:27:26,660
Hey. Did Stark ever
respond to my page?

485
00:27:26,762 --> 00:27:29,390
He's got three discharges, one of
them's been here since yesterday.

486
00:27:29,414 --> 00:27:32,299
Dr. Stark's in surgery. He
went back in on Lisa Collis.

487
00:27:32,401 --> 00:27:34,000
What?

488
00:27:38,524 --> 00:27:41,441
It's a great idea. So simple.

489
00:27:41,543 --> 00:27:45,044
Let's see if it works.
It is the right shape.

490
00:27:45,147 --> 00:27:47,397
It's celluloid so it
won't break down.

491
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:49,261
And the liver
will conform to it.

492
00:27:49,285 --> 00:27:52,952
- It's a great idea.
- Whose idea was it, Dr. Stark?

493
00:27:53,054 --> 00:27:56,623
Originally? Was it
yours or Dr. Karev's?

494
00:27:58,227 --> 00:28:00,360
Let's just see if it works.

495
00:28:10,538 --> 00:28:13,724
And I'm back, Ms.
Cortez. Did you miss me?

496
00:28:13,826 --> 00:28:17,360
Could you please let the dog
out? He won't stop barking.

497
00:28:17,462 --> 00:28:20,731
She's delirious. Pulse is thready! I
think she's in shock! Get her vitals.

498
00:28:20,833 --> 00:28:24,568
Oh, no, no! Damn it! Get me a
monitor in here! Call Dr. Bailey now!

499
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:27,053
- Right away, doctor.
- Come on.

500
00:28:27,922 --> 00:28:29,156
I'm almost done here.

501
00:28:29,258 --> 00:28:31,425
Get her into an OR, open
her up and wait for me.

502
00:28:31,527 --> 00:28:34,878
- I'll be there.
- Open? Did you say open her up?

503
00:28:43,755 --> 00:28:45,055
No word from Dr. Bailey?

504
00:28:48,477 --> 00:28:51,595
OK. Ten blade.

505
00:28:56,752 --> 00:28:59,232
The artery is at the
base of the heart.

506
00:28:59,271 --> 00:29:00,782
Bypass would be so much better.

507
00:29:00,806 --> 00:29:02,316
I cannot manage
this bleed on bypass.

508
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:04,174
OK, good. I can
clip the aneurysm.

509
00:29:04,276 --> 00:29:05,954
I need you to stop
what you're doing.

510
00:29:05,978 --> 00:29:08,645
I am trying to do a coronary
graft on a hemorrhaging heart.

511
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:10,258
- What do you suggest I do?
- Do it faster.

512
00:29:10,282 --> 00:29:13,267
All right, I need you to
stop making this my fault.

513
00:29:13,369 --> 00:29:16,269
Pack that. I tried
everything I could for Yang.

514
00:29:16,372 --> 00:29:19,773
I encouraged her into the
OR, I kept her out of the OR.

515
00:29:19,875 --> 00:29:23,310
I don't know what else I could
have done differently. Hold pressure.

516
00:29:23,412 --> 00:29:25,762
More! OK, good. Go.

517
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:30,634
Yang was my student. Don't
you think that I wanted to help her?

518
00:29:30,736 --> 00:29:32,313
I have no doubt that's
what you wanted to do.

519
00:29:32,337 --> 00:29:33,854
But you're saying that I failed.

520
00:29:33,956 --> 00:29:35,250
I'm saying that we all failed.

521
00:29:35,274 --> 00:29:37,240
- So now it's time to back off.
- No, Shepherd,

522
00:29:37,342 --> 00:29:40,144
you need to back off. She's my
wife. I'm not gonna give up on her yet.

523
00:29:40,246 --> 00:29:44,081
All right! It's clear we all have
the same goal. We want her back.

524
00:29:44,183 --> 00:29:46,350
Done. I got it.

525
00:29:50,689 --> 00:29:51,922
I'm sorry.

526
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:56,676
I have a personal
stake in this, too.

527
00:29:56,778 --> 00:29:59,679
I would not be standing
here if it wasn't for her.

528
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,733
Right.

529
00:30:05,737 --> 00:30:09,172
But you're asking us to do
nothing, and we can't do that.

530
00:30:09,274 --> 00:30:12,709
- I can't do that.
- OK.

531
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:15,712
Let's start closing.

532
00:30:28,127 --> 00:30:32,229
Damn it! Time of death, 7:41.

533
00:30:33,215 --> 00:30:36,816
Son of a bitch!

534
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:38,518
This is not my fault!

535
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:40,987
She got a fistula, they
got delayed hemorrhage!

536
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:43,534
Post-op pancreatectomies always
get fistulas! I didn't screw this up!

537
00:30:43,558 --> 00:30:46,376
- Avery...
- No, you listen! They always get fistulas,

538
00:30:46,478 --> 00:30:48,556
then they get severe
complications, and they die!

539
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:51,876
I did what you said! You told me to
open her up, and then you weren't here.

540
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:53,449
- I tried to fix it.
- Avery.

541
00:30:53,552 --> 00:30:56,586
- This is not my damn fault!
- Dr. Avery!

542
00:30:58,057 --> 00:31:00,357
Step out of my OR.

543
00:31:23,249 --> 00:31:24,931
We are awesome.

544
00:31:25,033 --> 00:31:26,382
I can't believe we did all this.

545
00:31:26,484 --> 00:31:28,885
Uh, I did all this. You
opened one bottle of wine.

546
00:31:28,987 --> 00:31:30,932
- Could you find
where the napkins are?
- Hello?

547
00:31:30,956 --> 00:31:33,457
- Damn it. Uh, not ready!
- Hi.

548
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:36,927
Hey, if you're here for the
party, you're like way too early.

549
00:31:37,029 --> 00:31:38,309
I'm not here for the party.

550
00:31:40,332 --> 00:31:42,766
- Are you here
to tell me to come back?
- No.

551
00:31:42,868 --> 00:31:45,228
But a bunch of other
people are coming to do that.

552
00:31:47,439 --> 00:31:48,754
Oh, God.

553
00:31:50,625 --> 00:31:53,593
Are you OK?

554
00:31:53,695 --> 00:31:56,262
I'm sorry. I tried to find you.

555
00:31:56,364 --> 00:32:00,984
He is awful! He tried
to take all the credit.

556
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:04,688
- Is the kid OK? Is it gonna work?
- Yeah!

557
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:08,958
Of course it's gonna work. It's
brilliant. I'm gonna talk to the chief.

558
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:13,663
Because it is so unfair. You
did every single thing right today.

559
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:16,366
You covered that
attending's ass and you got...

560
00:32:16,468 --> 00:32:19,919
You got crapped on
every step of the way.

561
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:23,423
The chief should
know that. No, no.

562
00:32:23,525 --> 00:32:26,026
You're so...

563
00:32:26,127 --> 00:32:28,628
What you did today was so great.

564
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:30,624
You know, you don't
deserve this. I just...

565
00:32:30,648 --> 00:32:33,934
I wanted you to know
that somebody knows that.

566
00:32:34,036 --> 00:32:35,852
That I know that.

567
00:32:49,451 --> 00:32:52,585
You know, I'm,
uh... I've never, um...

568
00:32:52,687 --> 00:32:55,238
- This is my first time.
- I know. You want to stop?

569
00:32:55,323 --> 00:32:58,658
No. No, I don't
wanna stop. I just...

570
00:33:09,505 --> 00:33:12,956
- Can we just go, uh... slower?
- What?

571
00:33:13,058 --> 00:33:16,676
Can... Can we please
just go a little slower?

572
00:33:16,778 --> 00:33:19,229
It's just... I need...

573
00:33:19,331 --> 00:33:22,933
You need what? What do you
need? What do you need from me?

574
00:33:23,035 --> 00:33:25,101
You wanna screw? Let's screw.

575
00:33:25,204 --> 00:33:26,636
You don't? Then get out!

576
00:33:26,738 --> 00:33:29,450
I'm not gonna hold your virgin
hand and walk you through it, damn it!

577
00:33:29,474 --> 00:33:31,625
You're not a child! I
can't take care of you!

578
00:33:31,727 --> 00:33:35,345
I can't take care of
everybody in this friggin' place!

579
00:34:04,842 --> 00:34:07,277
- Hi.
- Hey.

580
00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:10,113
Uh, I usually do a
post-op exam right now.

581
00:34:10,215 --> 00:34:12,199
Yeah, well, he's on a C-130

582
00:34:12,301 --> 00:34:13,845
halfway across the
country by this time.

583
00:34:13,869 --> 00:34:15,629
So I don't get to
check on his recovery?

584
00:34:15,653 --> 00:34:18,554
He's being well taken care of.

585
00:34:18,656 --> 00:34:21,191
- You did a good job.
- Oh...

586
00:34:21,293 --> 00:34:23,126
I can tell you that.

587
00:34:24,463 --> 00:34:26,073
What are you doing
hanging around?

588
00:34:26,097 --> 00:34:28,831
Well, I wanted to say thank you.

589
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:32,001
And that it, uh...

590
00:34:32,103 --> 00:34:33,919
It was nice meeting you.

591
00:34:40,162 --> 00:34:42,695
I'd say the same,

592
00:34:42,797 --> 00:34:45,582
but you were never here.

593
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:06,702
Welcome.

594
00:35:06,805 --> 00:35:08,733
Wine's on the table,
beer's in the fridge.

595
00:35:08,757 --> 00:35:11,841
- I have a fridge?
- And since you
actually live here,

596
00:35:11,926 --> 00:35:13,905
I'll hand over the
hosting duties to you.

597
00:35:13,929 --> 00:35:17,513
- Where's Cristina?
- Haven't seen her. Which is sort of rude.

598
00:35:18,499 --> 00:35:20,800
Torres might know, hang on.

599
00:35:22,837 --> 00:35:24,370
Callie, Yang say
where she was...?

600
00:35:24,472 --> 00:35:26,973
Oh, um...

601
00:35:27,075 --> 00:35:29,726
Can I move in with you?

602
00:35:29,828 --> 00:35:32,729
That might be the
rebound talking.

603
00:35:32,831 --> 00:35:37,684
Not like that, not that. Just till I can
get rid of the sub-letter in my place.

604
00:35:37,786 --> 00:35:41,471
I'm starting from scratch.
And I don't want to do it alone.

605
00:35:41,573 --> 00:35:45,524
Can't we be alone together?
Isn't it easier to be single in pairs?

606
00:35:47,495 --> 00:35:48,694
This a riddle?

607
00:35:49,431 --> 00:35:51,531
No, I'm drunk.

608
00:35:51,633 --> 00:35:54,751
- Come on. Can I?
- Sure.

609
00:35:54,853 --> 00:35:56,286
Yay!

610
00:35:56,388 --> 00:36:00,206
- Your hair is hot.
- Right?

611
00:36:05,513 --> 00:36:06,912
Oh, hi. Um...

612
00:36:07,014 --> 00:36:09,349
I... Sorry, I didn't...

613
00:36:09,451 --> 00:36:12,952
I know I should bring a gift. Like a
housewarming gift to things like this,

614
00:36:13,054 --> 00:36:16,088
but I didn't really have
time to bring anything.

615
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:21,061
- So I'm... really sorry.
- It is really... It's no problem.

616
00:36:21,163 --> 00:36:24,080
What happened? April? Hey, hey.

617
00:36:24,666 --> 00:36:26,016
Come on.

618
00:36:30,489 --> 00:36:32,989
Has anybody seen Cristina?

619
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:42,932
If you're asking my
opinion, I think you should.

620
00:36:43,035 --> 00:36:45,735
I think you absolutely have to.

621
00:36:45,837 --> 00:36:49,305
You should keep and
refinish the original floors.

622
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:54,427
Why do I have to? I mean, you guys
did what, like, bamboo or something?

623
00:36:54,529 --> 00:36:58,158
We're building our house from scratch,
we can put down whatever we want.

624
00:36:58,182 --> 00:37:00,828
- You have original oak floors.
- Yeah, but, what if
I don't like it?

625
00:37:00,852 --> 00:37:04,837
- I mean what if I hate oak?
- Doesn't matter. You have to do it.

626
00:37:04,939 --> 00:37:06,939
The building's historic.

627
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:10,760
I know.

628
00:37:11,596 --> 00:37:16,650
God! OK. OK. OK!

629
00:37:16,752 --> 00:37:21,137
<i>Every pressurized
system needs a relief valve.</i>

630
00:37:30,065 --> 00:37:34,767
<i>There has to be a way to
reduce the stress, the tension...</i>

631
00:37:37,038 --> 00:37:39,183
I got there as fast as I could.

632
00:37:39,207 --> 00:37:42,174
It was a grade-C fistula
with a ruptured splenic artery.

633
00:37:42,276 --> 00:37:45,428
You did everything
you could. Avery, too.

634
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:48,431
- Why don't you go home.
- Yes, sir.

635
00:37:52,871 --> 00:37:56,022
- Bailey look...
- Why do we see so
many post-op fistulas

636
00:37:56,124 --> 00:37:59,042
after pancreas surgeries?
Your operation is flawless.

637
00:37:59,144 --> 00:38:02,962
It doesn't matter, we still see fistulas
in... What, 20 percent of patients?

638
00:38:03,065 --> 00:38:06,799
I think there's a way to bring that
number down. I just got to find it.

639
00:38:06,901 --> 00:38:10,503
- Miranda...
- I needed a win, sir.

640
00:38:10,605 --> 00:38:14,106
I've got a string of big losses.

641
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:16,709
I could use a win, that's all.

642
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:20,496
Yang.

643
00:38:20,598 --> 00:38:24,033
Yang was the one I
didn't have to worry about.

644
00:38:25,454 --> 00:38:26,986
I know.

645
00:38:28,656 --> 00:38:29,889
I know.

646
00:38:29,991 --> 00:38:32,825
<i>Before it becomes
too much to bear.</i>

647
00:38:34,128 --> 00:38:37,096
Look into the pancreatectomy
patients. Figure it out.

648
00:38:37,198 --> 00:38:40,816
- And then let me
know how I can help.
- Uh, can I use Avery?

649
00:38:40,918 --> 00:38:44,203
He actually gave me the
idea. He was great today.

650
00:38:44,306 --> 00:38:45,838
Well, that's good to know.

651
00:38:45,941 --> 00:38:49,409
You know, Alex Karev saved a
baby's life with a ping-pong ball?

652
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:52,378
- Ping-pong ball?
- Yes, he did.

653
00:38:52,481 --> 00:38:53,746
Alex Karev.

654
00:38:53,848 --> 00:38:55,826
<i>There has to be
a way to find relief.</i>

655
00:38:55,850 --> 00:39:00,636
<i>Because if the pressure
doesn't find a way out...</i>

656
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:03,956
<i>it will make one.</i>

657
00:39:04,058 --> 00:39:06,175
Listen. Let me talk to her.

658
00:39:06,277 --> 00:39:09,829
All right.

659
00:39:14,752 --> 00:39:17,487
Come here, come
on, here. Come on!

660
00:39:17,589 --> 00:39:19,405
<i>It will explode.</i>

661
00:39:19,507 --> 00:39:22,408
OK, OK. Let's go. Outside.

662
00:39:28,516 --> 00:39:32,819
<i>It's the pressure we put on
ourselves that's the hardest to bear.</i>

663
00:39:32,921 --> 00:39:37,090
You think it was hard for
Yang? To quit, to just walk away?

664
00:39:37,191 --> 00:39:39,558
Oh, don't be stupid.
You're not quitting.

665
00:39:39,661 --> 00:39:42,028
Besides, you might have
just gotten yourself fired.

666
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:44,847
- Or arrested. Probably both.
- Yeah, well,

667
00:39:44,949 --> 00:39:47,934
April is the only friend
I have left here. So...

668
00:39:48,036 --> 00:39:50,003
Don't be stupid.

669
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,400
<i>The pressure to be
better than we are.</i>

670
00:39:54,442 --> 00:39:56,587
What the hell were you
thinking? She's a virgin.

671
00:39:56,611 --> 00:40:01,380
- Why would you do that?
- I know. God. Ow! Ow!

672
00:40:01,483 --> 00:40:04,394
If you needed it that bad, Alex,
you should have gone back to Vegas.

673
00:40:04,418 --> 00:40:07,887
- There's a whole
industry there.
- I didn't go to Vegas.

674
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:11,557
- I went to Iowa.
- You went to Iowa?

675
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:14,093
I went home.

676
00:40:14,196 --> 00:40:17,881
- My brother, remember Aaron?
- Yeah.

677
00:40:18,983 --> 00:40:21,718
Doctor said...

678
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:23,969
He got diagnosed schizophrenic.

679
00:40:24,739 --> 00:40:27,439
Just like my mom.

680
00:40:27,542 --> 00:40:32,227
You know how they figured it
out? He tried to kill our little sister.

681
00:40:32,330 --> 00:40:36,749
She's 16. She's a kid. And
her brother tried to kill her.

682
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:42,405
And my mom didn't do anything
'cause she's off her meds and...

683
00:40:43,408 --> 00:40:45,975
Anyway, I was in Iowa.
That's where I went.

684
00:40:46,077 --> 00:40:49,145
To my brother's commitment
hearing. I had to commit him. Whatever.

685
00:40:49,247 --> 00:40:52,364
<i>The pressure to be better
than we think we can be.</i>

686
00:40:52,466 --> 00:40:56,369
- Well, it's good
that you were there.
- I wasn't there.

687
00:40:56,470 --> 00:40:58,404
I wasn't.

688
00:41:02,143 --> 00:41:06,812
I showed up, I held my sister's hand
in the hospital for like ten minutes,

689
00:41:06,914 --> 00:41:09,182
I shoved some pills
down my mom's throat,

690
00:41:09,284 --> 00:41:11,601
I signed my brother
into a nuthouse.

691
00:41:11,703 --> 00:41:16,022
Then I got the hell out
of there as fast as I could.

692
00:41:16,124 --> 00:41:20,510
I wasn't there. I'm the ass
who can't stand to be there.

693
00:41:20,612 --> 00:41:23,913
<i>It never, ever lets up.</i>

694
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:27,850
I should go down there.

695
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:30,903
I have to go down there.

696
00:41:32,339 --> 00:41:35,307
Yeah, I should go.

697
00:41:38,846 --> 00:41:41,664
You good?

698
00:41:41,766 --> 00:41:44,000
Anything else you
want to talk about?

699
00:41:46,505 --> 00:41:52,508
- What are you doing
for bathroom tile?
- Oh. Bathroom tile. Um...

700
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:56,746
I don't know yet. I
think I'm going to...

701
00:41:57,648 --> 00:41:59,082
<i>It just builds</i>

702
00:41:59,184 --> 00:42:01,684
<i>and builds and builds.</i>
