1
00:00:04,805 --> 00:00:07,622
<i>They train doctors. Slowly.</i>

2
00:00:07,724 --> 00:00:09,924
<i>They watch us practice on frogs</i>

3
00:00:10,026 --> 00:00:12,360
<i>and pigs and dead people,</i>

4
00:00:12,463 --> 00:00:16,181
<i>and then live people.
They drill us relentlessly.</i>

5
00:00:16,283 --> 00:00:18,166
<i>They raise us like children.</i>

6
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:20,602
<i>And eventually, they
take a cold, hard boot</i>

7
00:00:20,704 --> 00:00:23,204
<i>and they kick us
out of the nest.</i>

8
00:00:23,306 --> 00:00:25,807
I have great faith
in you. Great faith.

9
00:00:25,926 --> 00:00:29,611
I can because I chose
you. I trained you.

10
00:00:29,713 --> 00:00:32,097
I've watched you work.
I know what you can do.

11
00:00:32,199 --> 00:00:36,417
That's why today's different. The
training wheels are coming off, people.

12
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,653
I'm throwing down the
gauntlet today, people.

13
00:00:38,755 --> 00:00:42,507
I've got a million dollar surplus,
and one department gets it.

14
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:45,460
You know what you need
and I know what you need.

15
00:00:45,562 --> 00:00:49,847
Now, I want to know what you want.
And I'm gonna keep the residents busy.

16
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:54,736
Very busy. So that'll give you
time to put your best foot forward.

17
00:00:54,838 --> 00:00:56,938
- Navy scrubs?
- Attending scrubs.

18
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:00,759
You are attendings today.
Run the cases. Take point.

19
00:01:00,861 --> 00:01:04,129
But don't be a fool. If you get
in over your head, cry "uncle."

20
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:07,215
Until then, congratulations.

21
00:01:07,318 --> 00:01:09,301
You've just been promoted.

22
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:16,124
Um, Chief Webber? Sorry.
I-I didn't get any scrubs.

23
00:01:16,226 --> 00:01:18,346
This is for fourth-year
residents only, Grey.

24
00:01:18,378 --> 00:01:20,218
It's just a regular day for you.

25
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:24,882
Fine. If they're gonna be attendings,
that makes me chief resident.

26
00:01:24,985 --> 00:01:29,488
- That makes you
our scut monkey.
- No, it doesn't.

27
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,723
Does... Does it? It doesn't!

28
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:48,873
The attendings aren't going anywhere.
We're basically just playing dress-up.

29
00:01:48,975 --> 00:01:50,642
Yeah.

30
00:01:58,419 --> 00:02:00,212
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

31
00:02:00,236 --> 00:02:04,039
- Are you sure this
is a good idea?
- Of course it is.

32
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,775
We all did it. It's the
evolution of the craft.

33
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:10,945
The passing of the torch. The
lifeblood of the training process.

34
00:02:13,283 --> 00:02:16,384
Here you go. Here you go.

35
00:02:22,259 --> 00:02:25,594
Pray, people. We want
God in the building today.

36
00:02:25,696 --> 00:02:28,496
- What time are we pitching you?
- Yeah, is there an order?

37
00:02:28,598 --> 00:02:31,394
You people are adults. You decide
the order. I decide whose department

38
00:02:31,418 --> 00:02:32,767
gets the million dollars.

39
00:02:32,869 --> 00:02:35,988
I love a good dogfight.

40
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:38,840
He can be intimidating.
Once you get in the room.

41
00:02:38,942 --> 00:02:40,776
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

42
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:43,206
When I pitched my cartilage
research last year, he was all ticked off

43
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,713
'cause I had a typo in
my table of contents.

44
00:02:45,815 --> 00:02:48,516
- You had a table of contents?
- Yeah.

45
00:02:53,156 --> 00:02:56,758
What? I love a
good dogfight, too.

46
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:58,460
Ruff!

47
00:02:58,562 --> 00:03:00,506
It's my case. You gonna
hand me over the chart?

48
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:04,565
What factors would lead a patient
to want breast reduction surgery?

49
00:03:04,668 --> 00:03:07,802
Neck pain, back
pain, balance issues.

50
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:09,704
- Hand it over.
- Keep trying.

51
00:03:09,806 --> 00:03:11,651
I don't know.
Maybe she's a prude.

52
00:03:11,675 --> 00:03:14,654
Doesn't want everyone staring at her
all the time. Maybe she's embarrassed.

53
00:03:14,678 --> 00:03:17,629
No. But you're getting warmer.

54
00:03:20,184 --> 00:03:22,868
- Hi, I'm Dr. Karev.
- Mindy Gruberman.

55
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:27,672
- Nice to meet you.
- I can work with that.

56
00:03:27,774 --> 00:03:28,857
She's not the patient.

57
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,154
Dr. Robbins. You'll be
on my service, too, huh?

58
00:03:31,178 --> 00:03:33,845
Dr. Karev's gonna be
our team leader today.

59
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:36,798
Excuse me.

60
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,150
Honey, quit futzing with
the gown and come out here.

61
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:40,702
The doctors want to see you.

62
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:44,822
What's up?

63
00:03:50,414 --> 00:03:53,849
Ms. Radigan, you're still having these
headaches and ringing in the ears?

64
00:03:53,951 --> 00:03:56,484
All day long. It's
driving me crazy.

65
00:03:56,586 --> 00:03:58,854
It's caused by a build-up
of fluid in your skull.

66
00:03:58,956 --> 00:04:00,836
So, what we will
do is insert a shunt,

67
00:04:00,874 --> 00:04:02,836
and that will relieve the
pressure on your brain.

68
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:06,678
What do you mean "we"? You're doing
the actual tube part in the brain, right?

69
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,326
- Not them?
- Excuse her. She's a school teacher,

70
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:12,451
she talks to everyone like they're
hiding gum behind their back.

71
00:04:12,553 --> 00:04:16,805
It's all right. She can ask questions.
Dr. Grey and Dr. Avery are residents,

72
00:04:16,907 --> 00:04:19,919
they're very talented. One of them
will be performing the procedure,

73
00:04:19,943 --> 00:04:22,160
- and I will be observing.
- A trainee?

74
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:25,147
Cutting into Ellie's brain? No.

75
00:04:25,249 --> 00:04:29,217
I know it sounds like a leap, but
these doctors study and assist for years.

76
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:31,047
At some point, we
have to let them operate.

77
00:04:31,071 --> 00:04:34,000
- It's how we make new surgeons.
- Let them learn
on someone else.

78
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:36,758
Who? Someone who's too
scared to interrogate the doctors?

79
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:40,245
They have to learn on someone,
might as well be an old lady.

80
00:04:40,347 --> 00:04:43,865
You're my old lady.
This should be my call.

81
00:04:43,984 --> 00:04:46,162
I won't let them move a muscle
without my direction and approval.

82
00:04:46,186 --> 00:04:49,938
You're a teacher,
Joanne. Let the kids learn.

83
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:55,543
She's my life. She has
been my life for 40 years.

84
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:57,645
Do you hear me?

85
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:00,865
I hear you.

86
00:05:00,951 --> 00:05:04,285
<i>Radiology, contact...</i>

87
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:07,033
- Who gets to cut?
- I want to get a look
at both of you

88
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:08,735
with a drill before I
decide who gets the shunt.

89
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:10,636
Skills lab seems
like a fair way to go.

90
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:13,461
Competing with the wife.
Like that's not a stacked deck.

91
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:16,164
Well, it's a game, really.
So all you have to do is win.

92
00:05:16,266 --> 00:05:17,732
Which you won't.

93
00:05:17,834 --> 00:05:21,319
I don't like the idea of
teenagers getting plastic surgery.

94
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:23,166
If the growths were on his
face, you wouldn't have a problem

95
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:25,351
- with him wanting them removed.
- Yeah, but I
might have a problem

96
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:29,577
- with Karev removing them.
- I'll give you that.

97
00:05:29,679 --> 00:05:34,098
- Oof! What happened?
- Karev's about
to do a gynecomastia

98
00:05:34,201 --> 00:05:36,818
- surgery on a 13-year-old.
- Oh, Karev's fine.

99
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,848
He's done way bigger
procedures than that.

100
00:05:38,872 --> 00:05:41,417
You two would just rather worry about
him than about your, uh, presentations

101
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:43,642
- to the chief.
- Oh! I'm not worried.

102
00:05:43,744 --> 00:05:47,162
The money's going to the tiny humans.
No one ever says no to the tiny humans.

103
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:49,363
Oh. OK.

104
00:05:51,468 --> 00:05:54,385
- What?
- Well...

105
00:05:54,487 --> 00:05:57,299
You're not gonna cry, 'cause
you find the chief intimidating?

106
00:05:57,323 --> 00:05:59,640
- No!
- Good!

107
00:05:59,742 --> 00:06:03,327
- Good. OK.
- I have work to do.

108
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:05,079
Bye.

109
00:06:06,483 --> 00:06:08,177
What, are you trying
to psych her out?

110
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,801
Ortho needs the money.

111
00:06:09,903 --> 00:06:11,981
She and the friggin' tiny humans
have all the help they need already.

112
00:06:12,005 --> 00:06:16,825
- I'm getting the money. Let it go.
- Oh, OK.

113
00:06:16,927 --> 00:06:21,646
- Why wouldn't I?
- Well, because you never
prepare for anything,

114
00:06:21,749 --> 00:06:24,332
you think you'll get by on
your good looks and charm

115
00:06:24,434 --> 00:06:27,151
and the brilliance that
pops off the top of your head.

116
00:06:27,253 --> 00:06:29,905
Yeah, 'cause it always works.

117
00:06:30,007 --> 00:06:32,857
Mm... Uh-huh.

118
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:42,333
Roy Henley, 57, was
admitted two days ago

119
00:06:42,436 --> 00:06:44,870
with severe wheezing from
pulmonary hypertension.

120
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:47,606
- Which basically means...
- I can't breathe for crap.

121
00:06:47,691 --> 00:06:51,292
We're gonna run some tests that
should help us decide how to proceed.

122
00:06:51,394 --> 00:06:54,474
You can run all the tests you
want. But what I need is new lungs.

123
00:06:54,498 --> 00:06:59,784
My doctor said I was gonna need
'em one day, but I was too healthy for it.

124
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:06,574
I bet I'm not too healthy now.

125
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:09,244
Dr. Yang?

126
00:07:13,917 --> 00:07:15,667
We'll run some tests.

127
00:07:17,754 --> 00:07:22,073
Uh, Mr. Henley, you listed your
daughter as your emergency contact.

128
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:25,660
- Is she here with you today?
- No, she lives
over in Aberdeen.

129
00:07:25,762 --> 00:07:28,413
- I don't want to trouble her.
- Is there anyone here with you?

130
00:07:28,515 --> 00:07:31,082
I'm a tough old dog. I
don't need a chaperone.

131
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:34,252
Sir, your condition is serious.

132
00:07:34,354 --> 00:07:37,772
It might be time to
trouble your daughter.

133
00:07:40,176 --> 00:07:43,111
- We think he's
a transplant candidate?
- Do we?

134
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:46,748
At this point, I don't think there's
anything else we can do. Right?

135
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:49,017
Dr. Yang? Do you agree?

136
00:07:49,119 --> 00:07:51,853
I don't know.

137
00:07:51,955 --> 00:07:54,216
- You don't know if you agree?
- - He'd have to be approved

138
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,557
by the transplant team
before going on the waiting list.

139
00:07:56,659 --> 00:07:59,644
- Do we convene a panel?
- Yang, do we?

140
00:07:59,746 --> 00:08:01,496
I couldn't say.

141
00:08:01,598 --> 00:08:05,533
He's running out of time. I say
we convene the panel for today.

142
00:08:05,635 --> 00:08:07,446
OK, convene the
panel. And then what?

143
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:11,772
I get some interns to order
Mr. Henley's tests. On it.

144
00:08:11,874 --> 00:08:14,826
Dr. Yang. "I don't know"?

145
00:08:16,179 --> 00:08:19,046
I'm here, I am trying,
but taking point...

146
00:08:19,149 --> 00:08:23,300
I am not asking you to be in an
OR. I am asking you to say something.

147
00:08:23,403 --> 00:08:26,337
To participate. We're
at a crossroads, Yang.

148
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:29,491
A crossroads where you
either get in the game...

149
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:34,095
or I tell Richard it's
time to send you home.

150
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:47,825
Imagine. Seattle Grace.

151
00:08:47,928 --> 00:08:50,195
The hospital that made
heart surgery obsolete.

152
00:08:50,297 --> 00:08:53,514
That's a big claim.

153
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:56,601
If the five million Americans
who suffer from heart failure

154
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:59,271
could simply just regenerate
their own damaged hearts...

155
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:03,574
It sounds like magic, but
it's possible. It's happening.

156
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:06,677
Dr. Altman, stem cell
research is on the cutting edge

157
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:09,647
of every field of
medicine. Why cardio?

158
00:09:09,749 --> 00:09:13,751
Well, Cardio and Neuro are
the beacons of this hospital.

159
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:16,254
They're what put you on the map.

160
00:09:16,339 --> 00:09:20,141
But you know what? You
can't give this money to Neuro.

161
00:09:20,243 --> 00:09:24,428
Neuro isn't even really a department.
It's just one strong surgeon.

162
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:27,015
You're better off putting your
money onto a deeper bench.

163
00:09:27,117 --> 00:09:31,152
- What do you mean?
- Well, Shepherd, he's
like a charismatic cult leader.

164
00:09:31,254 --> 00:09:35,423
He's very appealing and he's got a bunch
of people hiding in his shadows. But...

165
00:09:35,525 --> 00:09:37,825
Don't get me wrong,
he is a great surgeon.

166
00:09:37,945 --> 00:09:42,297
And he can pull off a flashy
procedure. But is he cultivating talent?

167
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,766
Is he taking the time to teach your
residents, knowing when to push

168
00:09:45,869 --> 00:09:49,687
and dishing out tough love when
they need it? That's the hard part.

169
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:52,423
I don't know, maybe Shepherd
just doesn't like competition.

170
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:57,962
He tried to fire me. Not that
I'm holding a grudge or anything.

171
00:09:59,198 --> 00:10:03,251
Well, not much of one, anyway.

172
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:06,538
I'm, uh...

173
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,290
I feel like I should
have stuck to my notes.

174
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:13,656
- Is Teddy saying
you could be fired?
- Sounded that way.

175
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,497
Well, is she trying to
scare you? Is it working?

176
00:10:16,599 --> 00:10:19,500
- I don't think so.
- Oh! Damn it.

177
00:10:19,602 --> 00:10:21,903
- What's his problem?
- Derek's got us competing

178
00:10:22,005 --> 00:10:24,439
for a brain shunt insertion.
The egg is the skull.

179
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:27,575
You can break the shell, but
you can't break the membrane.

180
00:10:27,677 --> 00:10:29,272
- Damn it!
- I feel bad for him.

181
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:32,880
He's kind of losing it.

182
00:10:32,982 --> 00:10:35,683
I shouldn't be in
charge of anybody.

183
00:10:35,785 --> 00:10:39,971
Just put one foot in front of the
other. Just get through the day.

184
00:10:40,073 --> 00:10:43,474
Grey! You broke
my concentration.

185
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:47,345
Sorry. Um, hey. Post-ops look
good, so if there's nothing else...

186
00:10:47,447 --> 00:10:51,165
Oh, could you discharge 1224?
And his chart needs to be dictated.

187
00:10:51,267 --> 00:10:54,919
Uh, yes. It's gonna have to wait
until after I check on Torres' knee girl,

188
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:56,453
turf the window jumper to Psych,

189
00:10:56,556 --> 00:10:58,300
remove a june bug from
some kid's ear in the pit,

190
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,859
write meds for screaming kidney
stones guy and then deliver labs

191
00:11:00,961 --> 00:11:02,944
- to my goiter lady.
- Stop bragging.

192
00:11:03,046 --> 00:11:05,613
I can't. I was born
for this kind of day.

193
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:14,072
No. Stop.

194
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:15,706
Seth. No.

195
00:11:15,808 --> 00:11:18,487
- OK? This can
wait a couple years.
- Mom!

196
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:21,563
You said this was my decision!
You said after my bar mitzvah,

197
00:11:21,665 --> 00:11:23,392
I'd be a man and I could decide.

198
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,661
That is because we thought by
13, you'd make the mature decision.

199
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,613
You can't cut off the
parts of your body

200
00:11:27,637 --> 00:11:31,689
that you don't like, all right? I don't
like my thighs or my saggy arms

201
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:34,658
or my chin, but if we all
cut off the parts we don't like,

202
00:11:34,761 --> 00:11:36,694
- we'd all have nothing left.
- Mom!

203
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:40,431
Seth! Your father has the
exact same chest as you,

204
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:43,151
and nobody thinks he's a woman.

205
00:11:44,053 --> 00:11:46,804
Would you please talk to her?

206
00:11:46,907 --> 00:11:48,589
I'm calling your father.

207
00:11:51,361 --> 00:11:56,480
They call me Booby at
school. Man-boobs, Double D.

208
00:11:56,582 --> 00:11:58,983
Some kid keeps hanging
a bra on my locker.

209
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:01,485
I'm starting high
school in a year.

210
00:12:01,587 --> 00:12:05,190
It's gonna be all new
people. I just wanna start over.

211
00:12:05,292 --> 00:12:09,510
I wanna be normal
like everyone else.

212
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:12,341
Why can't we just
skip the panel?

213
00:12:12,365 --> 00:12:13,698
We know I need the lungs.

214
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,411
Not everyone makes a
good transplant candidate.

215
00:12:15,435 --> 00:12:17,613
If someone can't reliably
take their anti-rejection meds...

216
00:12:17,637 --> 00:12:19,937
- I can.
- Or has severe disease

217
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:21,923
- in another organ...
- I don't.

218
00:12:22,025 --> 00:12:23,975
There are just
a lot of indicators

219
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:25,638
as to whether a
person is strong enough

220
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:28,996
- to survive the surgery.
- I wanna know what she thinks.

221
00:12:29,098 --> 00:12:32,767
The one with the
sourpuss on her face.

222
00:12:34,604 --> 00:12:36,838
I don't have a sourpuss.
This is just my face.

223
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:39,323
It's true. It is just her face.

224
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,726
You think I'll pass the panel?

225
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:47,765
I couldn't say.

226
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:50,435
Cheer up, sourpuss.

227
00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:53,488
You're young,
you got your health.

228
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:55,670
I think you're doing
all right. Both of you.

229
00:12:55,725 --> 00:12:59,627
Practically kids, and doctors, no
less. I bet your dads are really proud.

230
00:12:59,729 --> 00:13:04,732
I'm from a small town. A farm, actually.
So yes, my dad was over the moon

231
00:13:04,834 --> 00:13:07,768
- when I became a doctor.
- What about you?

232
00:13:11,591 --> 00:13:14,893
Karev. Seth's
mother just came by

233
00:13:14,995 --> 00:13:17,240
saying she wants to pull the
plug on the kid's procedure.

234
00:13:17,264 --> 00:13:19,541
- That your idea
of taking point?
- I'm gonna talk to her.

235
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:23,168
I spent two hours consulting
with this family last month.

236
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:25,348
Ten minutes with you,
they're ready to walk.

237
00:13:25,372 --> 00:13:28,550
Pediatric surgery is 80 percent parent
management, Karev, you know that.

238
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:30,191
I'm handling it.

239
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:37,632
Megan, hi. I'm Dr. Grey. Just
checking in to see how you're feeling.

240
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:39,801
Megan. Meg!

241
00:13:39,903 --> 00:13:44,556
- She doesn't hear well
when she's texting.
- I can hear her.

242
00:13:44,658 --> 00:13:46,841
Where's the other
doctor? Dr. Torres.

243
00:13:46,943 --> 00:13:49,543
Oh, I'll be checking you
today. How's your knee?

244
00:13:49,646 --> 00:13:53,063
- Is the, uh, pain any better?
- Look, you seem really sweet,

245
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:57,267
but this whole, like, super busy,
messy-hair, running like a banshee thing

246
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:00,038
you have going doesn't
exactly inspire confidence.

247
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:03,557
I mean, you don't
even know my case.

248
00:14:03,659 --> 00:14:05,737
Meg Whealon. Age 28.
Tibial plateau fracture

249
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:08,224
caused by a bicycle accident. At
least, that's what you told the ER,

250
00:14:08,248 --> 00:14:10,075
but you told Dr. Torres
that you were

251
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:12,378
going 30 miles an hour, which
makes me think that you were

252
00:14:12,402 --> 00:14:14,813
on your boyfriend's motorcycle. I'm
gonna guess he has a license for it

253
00:14:14,837 --> 00:14:16,999
- and you don't.
- This is off
the top of your head?

254
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:20,358
I memorized your chart. Your
fracture was fixed with elevation

255
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,721
and percutaneous screw fixture.
You are allergic to penicillin.

256
00:14:22,745 --> 00:14:25,157
Currently on blood thinners to
make sure you don't develop DVT,

257
00:14:25,181 --> 00:14:27,426
and if you'd just talk to me about
your knee, I could adjust your pain meds

258
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:29,967
and be out of your hair.

259
00:14:30,587 --> 00:14:32,520
She's good.

260
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:37,708
- You're good.
- I'm busy. But I can handle it.

261
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:42,897
Every doctor in this hospital needs
trauma training. Disaster training.

262
00:14:42,999 --> 00:14:44,343
You've got a strong department.

263
00:14:44,367 --> 00:14:47,818
No, not just my staff, everyone.

264
00:14:49,522 --> 00:14:54,725
Eleven people died in that shooting.
Eight of them never had a chance.

265
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:57,327
But the other three
could have been saved.

266
00:14:57,413 --> 00:15:00,848
Charles Percy had a gunshot
wound to the abdomen.

267
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:03,717
Miranda Bailey did everything
that she was trained to do.

268
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,582
She gave him fluids, controlled
the bleeding, applied pressure.

269
00:15:06,606 --> 00:15:09,706
Then she tried to get him
to an OR. But she couldn't.

270
00:15:09,809 --> 00:15:12,705
And so he died. A doctor with
disaster training would have been able

271
00:15:12,729 --> 00:15:18,199
to assess that environment more quickly
and known an alternative escape route.

272
00:15:18,301 --> 00:15:20,145
Dr. Bailey was not
trained to do that.

273
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:23,470
Neither are 90 percent of
the doctors on your staff.

274
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:30,144
She'll remember him dying
in her arms the rest of her life.

275
00:15:30,246 --> 00:15:34,665
And I'll remember it. And you'll
remember that we could have saved him.

276
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,901
We failed her.

277
00:15:37,003 --> 00:15:41,472
And we failed Charles
Percy. One of our own doctors.

278
00:15:41,574 --> 00:15:43,674
I can't face that.

279
00:15:45,895 --> 00:15:48,696
I can't face that ever again.

280
00:15:48,798 --> 00:15:50,064
Can you?

281
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:59,723
I'd like to expand the
burn unit at Seattle Grace.

282
00:15:59,826 --> 00:16:02,860
Make us the go-to destination
for serious burn victims.

283
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:06,080
I'd also like to upgrade us to a
real nationally renowned center

284
00:16:06,182 --> 00:16:10,818
- for cosmetic
reconstructive surgery.
- Two sub-specialties?

285
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:15,256
The revenue from the cosmetic
center helps support the burn unit.

286
00:16:15,358 --> 00:16:17,258
One hand scratches the other.

287
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:22,413
It's a nice idea, and an awfully
ambitious plan for a million dollars.

288
00:16:22,515 --> 00:16:24,798
And a tremendous amount of work.

289
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:34,225
I'm not seeing anyone right now.

290
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:37,128
I'm not sleeping with nurses.

291
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:40,831
Residents, attendings... Nobody.

292
00:16:41,901 --> 00:16:45,936
So I'm an untapped
source of raw power.

293
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:48,673
I'm telling you, I have
the energy of ten men,

294
00:16:48,775 --> 00:16:54,045
so with your million dollars
and my untapped stores,

295
00:16:54,147 --> 00:16:56,580
we can move mountains.

296
00:17:00,069 --> 00:17:02,670
Are you excited? I'm excited.

297
00:17:05,074 --> 00:17:08,259
Leave. Right now. Just...

298
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:12,846
Just...

299
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:20,671
Mrs. Gruberman, every
surgery has its risks,

300
00:17:20,773 --> 00:17:22,468
but this one is pretty simple.

301
00:17:22,492 --> 00:17:25,037
It'll make your son feel a
whole lot better about himself.

302
00:17:25,061 --> 00:17:27,273
If the surgery is really a
good idea, I would like to hear it

303
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:29,925
- from Dr. Robbins
and Dr. Sloan.
- Look, I'm...

304
00:17:29,949 --> 00:17:33,400
No. I will speak to
Dr. Robbins and Dr. Sloan.

305
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:38,706
Cristina! Cristina, Roy's labs.

306
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:43,093
He's got fungal pneumonia and his
creatinine clearance is dangerously low.

307
00:17:43,195 --> 00:17:45,896
If it gets any worse, we're
looking at renal failure.

308
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:48,348
I'm surprised he was
sitting up and talking.

309
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:51,869
After surgery, couldn't the
immunosuppressants kill him?

310
00:17:51,971 --> 00:17:55,489
- Maybe.
- Well, OK. If we don't recommend him,

311
00:17:55,591 --> 00:17:58,775
he dies. But, uh, if we recommend
someone who won't survive,

312
00:17:58,877 --> 00:18:01,673
then it's just a waste of an organ
that could have gone to someone else.

313
00:18:01,697 --> 00:18:04,048
- What do you think?
- I don't know.

314
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:08,536
You need to know. We have to have
an opinion, we called the stupid panel!

315
00:18:08,638 --> 00:18:11,317
We have to stand up in
front of Teddy, and the chief

316
00:18:11,341 --> 00:18:14,842
and a room full of doctors and
recommend whether this guy lives or dies.

317
00:18:14,944 --> 00:18:18,579
And it's right down the middle
with this guy. Like a trick question.

318
00:18:18,681 --> 00:18:20,314
It's a trick...

319
00:18:22,185 --> 00:18:24,012
Fine. Forget it.
The right opinion,

320
00:18:24,036 --> 00:18:26,971
the only opinion that matters,
is Teddy's. So I will just

321
00:18:27,073 --> 00:18:29,757
figure out what she
thinks, and I will say that.

322
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:31,825
OK.

323
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:35,579
Don't you care at all?

324
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:39,200
Come on, you gotta care.

325
00:18:45,091 --> 00:18:48,526
- No, you did not say that to the chief!
- - Oh, God.

326
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:50,573
It's your fault, you know.
You psyched me out.

327
00:18:50,597 --> 00:18:53,698
- What? All I ever do
is support you.
- Oh, look at that face.

328
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,461
- That's her game face. She's in it to win it.
- Huh?

329
00:18:56,485 --> 00:18:58,919
Oh! Hey, Karev! Did
you talk to Seth's mother?

330
00:18:59,038 --> 00:19:01,400
She's thinking about it. She
may wanna talk to you guys again.

331
00:19:01,424 --> 00:19:03,936
- Way to handle it.
- I can't force her
to listen to me.

332
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:07,728
Keep your face in that
book. It'll inspire confidence.

333
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:11,265
Oh, my God.

334
00:19:11,367 --> 00:19:13,411
OK, that's getting in
someone's head. I'm just honest.

335
00:19:13,435 --> 00:19:16,503
- Um, I'm up with the chief. I gotta go.
- Knock him dead.

336
00:19:16,606 --> 00:19:20,290
Oh. Wait, here. I brought
you tissues, just in case.

337
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:25,429
Thanks.

338
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:30,535
- You have a sickness. You do.
- Hm? Oh.

339
00:19:30,637 --> 00:19:33,621
OK, 30 seconds. If neither one
of you breaks the membrane,

340
00:19:33,723 --> 00:19:35,166
I'm gonna have to
judge you on precision,

341
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:36,869
so make sure your
initials are clean and clear.

342
00:19:36,893 --> 00:19:38,136
- Dr. Shepherd?
- Yes.

343
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,476
Stop talking!

344
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,946
Five, four, three,

345
00:19:43,049 --> 00:19:46,817
two, one, time.

346
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:48,652
What do you got?

347
00:19:51,373 --> 00:19:54,642
Oh. Not bad. What
about you, Dr. Avery?

348
00:19:54,744 --> 00:19:57,928
- I just wish I had more time.
- Oh, really?

349
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:03,534
- You did your whole name.
- What?!

350
00:20:06,272 --> 00:20:07,371
You conned me!

351
00:20:07,473 --> 00:20:09,433
I don't know what
you're talking about.

352
00:20:09,475 --> 00:20:11,520
He hustled me! He went
through two dozen eggs

353
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:13,188
and made me think I
didn't have to practice.

354
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,757
If you didn't practice, Meredith,
you were over-confident.

355
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:18,765
Dr. Avery, congratulations.
You have the surgery.

356
00:20:26,993 --> 00:20:30,510
And then I would take the remaining
money and invest it in resources

357
00:20:30,612 --> 00:20:34,581
for less invasive
pediatric cancer surgeries.

358
00:20:34,684 --> 00:20:38,518
Even the smallest change could
dramatically improve the lives

359
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:43,057
of so many children.
Wouldn't that be amazing?

360
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:46,694
That is a very compelling and very
focused presentation, Dr. Robbins.

361
00:20:46,796 --> 00:20:50,881
- You seem surprised.
- No. Not at all.

362
00:20:50,984 --> 00:20:52,824
Did you think I
was going to cry?

363
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:57,238
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Um...

364
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:00,640
Torres suggested that I
was going to cry as well.

365
00:21:02,528 --> 00:21:07,264
I think that we should all try to wipe
the crying thing out of our memories.

366
00:21:07,366 --> 00:21:10,601
It happens very rarely,
it's embarrassing,

367
00:21:10,703 --> 00:21:12,614
and, frankly, I think
I've got it under control.

368
00:21:12,638 --> 00:21:16,840
And the fact that my colleagues see
me as the type of person who would burst

369
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:19,855
into tears in the middle of an
important professional situation,

370
00:21:19,879 --> 00:21:21,790
well, that doesn't make me
weepy, that makes me mad.

371
00:21:21,814 --> 00:21:25,433
Like, violent. It makes me
want to punch someone.

372
00:21:25,535 --> 00:21:28,169
And, you know, I'm the
daughter of a Marine, sir.

373
00:21:28,271 --> 00:21:31,672
So I was taught to hit as a child, I
was taught to hit fast and hit hard,

374
00:21:31,774 --> 00:21:34,974
so you only have to hit once. Now,
I feel like hitting a person or a wall.

375
00:21:35,027 --> 00:21:36,960
No, a person!

376
00:21:41,317 --> 00:21:43,633
Mm...

377
00:21:43,735 --> 00:21:46,420
Let's just circle back to
the sweet little children.

378
00:21:50,359 --> 00:21:52,279
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

379
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:58,632
I like the dark blue scrubs
on you. You look good.

380
00:22:00,753 --> 00:22:02,953
You OK?

381
00:22:04,356 --> 00:22:07,124
My patient deserves a doctor.

382
00:22:07,226 --> 00:22:09,188
You don't have to cut.
Nobody's asking you to.

383
00:22:09,212 --> 00:22:12,846
I know that. I know what's being
asked of me and I'm doing it.

384
00:22:14,984 --> 00:22:19,720
OK. I got an idea. And
I think it's gonna help.

385
00:22:19,822 --> 00:22:23,156
You and me, we're gonna
go outside into the alley

386
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:25,659
behind the hospital and
you're just gonna kick my ass.

387
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:29,797
You're gonna knock
the living crap out of me.

388
00:22:31,233 --> 00:22:33,400
There you are.

389
00:22:33,502 --> 00:22:37,137
I knew you were
in there somewhere.

390
00:22:37,239 --> 00:22:41,875
At the end of this day, good or
bad, we're gonna go home together.

391
00:22:57,126 --> 00:23:00,038
Whatever it takes to get him
home. I just wanna get him home.

392
00:23:00,062 --> 00:23:04,080
- Um, two to three more...
- Thirteen is young
for plastic surgery.

393
00:23:04,182 --> 00:23:07,262
But your kid's not gonna grow out of
it. He's already gone through puberty,

394
00:23:07,286 --> 00:23:10,621
and his father's had the
same condition his entire life.

395
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:13,640
If he had weight to lose, I
would advise diet and exercise.

396
00:23:13,742 --> 00:23:17,477
But your kid doesn't have a
weight problem. He has breasts.

397
00:23:17,596 --> 00:23:19,913
He needs excision
of the glandular tissue.

398
00:23:20,015 --> 00:23:23,300
And yeah, it could wait till he's
older. But he's a dude with breasts

399
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:26,230
and he's headed for high school and
there's no reason he should be subjected

400
00:23:26,254 --> 00:23:29,690
to the psychological damage that comes
from years of taking schoolyard crap.

401
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:32,710
You want your kid to be a man?

402
00:23:32,812 --> 00:23:34,861
Let him make his own decisions.

403
00:23:39,535 --> 00:23:41,184
Any other questions?

404
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:46,092
- Hey. I got a page. Is everything OK?
- Something's wrong.

405
00:23:46,175 --> 00:23:48,019
First, she had a
headache and then...

406
00:23:48,043 --> 00:23:49,923
I can't see.
Everything is blurry.

407
00:23:49,962 --> 00:23:52,042
- OK, look right here.
- I am freaking out.

408
00:23:52,098 --> 00:23:53,425
Tell me I don't
need to freak out.

409
00:23:53,449 --> 00:23:54,926
The left side of my
body feels weird.

410
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:57,668
I thought it was because I
fell asleep on it, but it's tingling.

411
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:59,481
- OK, squeeze my hand.
- She had knee surgery.

412
00:23:59,505 --> 00:24:02,005
- What the hell is going on?
- I don't know yet,

413
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:05,742
but I'm gonna order a head CT, and
I'm going to page for a Neuro consult.

414
00:24:05,845 --> 00:24:09,113
Looks like you're gonna get to
see another doctor today after all.

415
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:15,502
The minute I hand you
this drill, you're on your own.

416
00:24:15,604 --> 00:24:18,922
You may have hustled Dr. Grey,
but you better not have hustled me.

417
00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:21,975
This is not a game.
This is a real brain.

418
00:24:22,077 --> 00:24:24,745
I got it. I'm ready.

419
00:24:28,434 --> 00:24:32,837
Dr. Shepherd, Lexie Grey is
paging you for a consult repeatedly.

420
00:24:32,939 --> 00:24:35,706
I'm in surgery. Dr. Grey?

421
00:24:35,791 --> 00:24:39,342
Well, are you sure? I wouldn't
want to be over-confident.

422
00:24:48,838 --> 00:24:51,755
- Cardio is not my thing.
- What?

423
00:24:53,409 --> 00:24:56,527
Neuro is my focus.
And this is cardiothoracic

424
00:24:56,629 --> 00:24:59,069
and I've had relatively little
experience with cardiothoracic,

425
00:24:59,131 --> 00:25:03,516
and I'm pretty sure I'm gonna walk
in there today and humiliate myself.

426
00:25:03,618 --> 00:25:06,219
Or humiliate you. Or
Teddy, or the chief.

427
00:25:06,322 --> 00:25:10,690
Really, anyone who could
possibly be humiliated by my failure

428
00:25:10,792 --> 00:25:12,976
is gonna be humiliated today.

429
00:25:17,049 --> 00:25:19,750
He was admitted two days ago.

430
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:24,754
Teddy could've convened a
panel yesterday, but she didn't.

431
00:25:26,425 --> 00:25:29,053
- She doesn't think
he's a candidate.
- No, she doesn't.

432
00:25:29,077 --> 00:25:32,346
So just say that,
and you'll be fine.

433
00:25:32,448 --> 00:25:34,047
Everyone will be fine,

434
00:25:34,149 --> 00:25:37,918
except for Roy,
who will be dead.

435
00:25:39,405 --> 00:25:42,239
Wow. Way to kill a happy moment.

436
00:25:45,561 --> 00:25:48,028
Where's Shepherd?
I paged Shepherd.

437
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:49,341
- You got me.
- You her boss?

438
00:25:49,365 --> 00:25:50,959
There's something
seriously wrong here.

439
00:25:50,983 --> 00:25:53,261
I need you to go to the waiting
room right now. Right now.

440
00:25:53,285 --> 00:25:54,701
Sir, come with me.

441
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:58,538
OK, um, she's post-op day
two from a tibial plateau fracture.

442
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,358
She was fine all day,
fine. Then ten minutes ago,

443
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:03,221
she started complaining
of headache, blurred vision

444
00:26:03,245 --> 00:26:06,647
and tingling on the left side of
her body. I ordered a stat head CT.

445
00:26:06,749 --> 00:26:08,627
I cannot believe that
you're the Neuro consult!

446
00:26:08,651 --> 00:26:11,551
- Is she on blood thinners?
- Yes, for DVT prophylaxis.

447
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:14,988
She's got a brain
bleed. Let's book an OR.

448
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:17,419
- How didn't I see this coming?
- Did you check her platelets?

449
00:26:17,443 --> 00:26:18,837
- Yes.
- And everything was normal?

450
00:26:18,861 --> 00:26:21,061
- Until now, yes.
- OK. You checked her platelets,

451
00:26:21,163 --> 00:26:23,291
you got a CT, you called
Neuro, you did everything right.

452
00:26:23,315 --> 00:26:25,410
The only thing you're doing wrong
is standing around talking about it

453
00:26:25,434 --> 00:26:27,612
wasting time while we should
be getting her to the OR.

454
00:26:27,636 --> 00:26:29,516
You totally sounded
like an attending.

455
00:26:29,572 --> 00:26:31,838
Right? Let's page Shepherd 911.

456
00:26:31,958 --> 00:26:34,825
Great.

457
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:37,944
Dr. Shepherd, it's Dr. Grey
again. Meredith Grey.

458
00:26:38,046 --> 00:26:41,448
Just passing the
ventriculostomy tube now.

459
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:44,451
- Almost there.
- Take your time, Dr. Avery.

460
00:26:44,553 --> 00:26:46,915
- You wanna make sure...
- Damn it! Damn it, damn it, damn it!

461
00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:51,158
Are you kidding me? Are you
kidding me? What did you do?

462
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:07,190
And that is why the future
of Ortho is in xenografting.

463
00:27:09,078 --> 00:27:10,561
You think I'm nuts.

464
00:27:10,663 --> 00:27:14,782
You're thinking, "I don't want
some cow ligament in my leg.

465
00:27:14,884 --> 00:27:19,053
- That sounds wacky!"
- Is that supposed
to be my voice?

466
00:27:19,155 --> 00:27:25,559
No. That's the voice of
the average baby boomer.

467
00:27:28,196 --> 00:27:31,030
I was hoping for
something more...

468
00:27:31,133 --> 00:27:32,599
inspirational.

469
00:27:32,701 --> 00:27:36,536
For... For example, Dr. Robbins
suggested that we take...

470
00:27:36,638 --> 00:27:39,806
Oh, yeah. The tiny humans.

471
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:43,493
- What?
- Arizona is nicer than I am.

472
00:27:43,595 --> 00:27:46,446
- I'm sorry...
- She's more patient.

473
00:27:46,548 --> 00:27:48,560
She went to Hopkins, she's
more renowned in her field,

474
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:52,769
she's a much better lesbian. I mean, I
was sort of a late bloomer in that area.

475
00:27:52,871 --> 00:27:54,966
But she's got this whole
circle of lesbian friends.

476
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:59,593
It's like this sub-culture.
And, uh, I'm always just...

477
00:27:59,694 --> 00:28:03,647
I'm always just
a little bit left out.

478
00:28:03,749 --> 00:28:07,033
Just a little bit talked down to,
because I have a long history

479
00:28:07,136 --> 00:28:09,964
of enjoying sex with men, which I
don't think is something I have to

480
00:28:09,988 --> 00:28:14,490
apologize for. Whatever,
I'm just... She's just... She's...

481
00:28:14,593 --> 00:28:17,377
- She's just better.
- So you want me to give Ortho

482
00:28:17,479 --> 00:28:21,731
a million dollars to level the
playing field in your relationship?

483
00:28:22,685 --> 00:28:24,284
Also, for the xenografting.

484
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:27,003
Which, as I mentioned,

485
00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:30,173
is the future of
sports medicine.

486
00:28:37,599 --> 00:28:39,983
Can I ask you something?

487
00:28:40,085 --> 00:28:43,787
Are you one of those, uh, you
know, what do you call 'em...

488
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:47,023
When someone's really
smart, like a genius,

489
00:28:47,126 --> 00:28:50,060
but they're a little different?

490
00:28:50,162 --> 00:28:53,496
Like they don't know
how to talk to people?

491
00:28:53,598 --> 00:28:56,683
- Are you asking me
if I'm autistic?
- That's the word.

492
00:28:58,604 --> 00:29:00,871
Oh, come on.

493
00:29:00,973 --> 00:29:04,291
You barely said
three words all day.

494
00:29:04,393 --> 00:29:07,093
Don't be offended.
You're a tough nut to crack.

495
00:29:07,196 --> 00:29:10,697
I like that about you. My
daughter's the same way.

496
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:13,750
- Were you able to make contact?
- Yeah. She's not coming.

497
00:29:13,836 --> 00:29:18,421
I'm not all that surprised. Messy
divorce, she sided with her mom.

498
00:29:18,523 --> 00:29:21,224
I hate it, but I get it.

499
00:29:21,326 --> 00:29:22,559
And life goes on.

500
00:29:24,063 --> 00:29:26,580
So it's just you
and me, sourpuss.

501
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:31,385
Dr. Yang, the, uh,
panel is gathering now.

502
00:29:31,487 --> 00:29:34,987
Yeah, I'll be right there.

503
00:29:36,692 --> 00:29:39,459
Hold on one second.
Hold on. Here you go.

504
00:29:39,562 --> 00:29:41,061
Thank you.

505
00:29:43,983 --> 00:29:46,250
This is gonna go my way, right?

506
00:29:46,352 --> 00:29:50,487
They just don't send
people home to die.

507
00:29:50,589 --> 00:29:52,506
I want to live.

508
00:29:53,192 --> 00:29:55,525
We'll let you know.

509
00:30:00,265 --> 00:30:03,216
- Is there anything I can do?
- I don't know, Avery.

510
00:30:03,318 --> 00:30:05,196
Is there anything you
can do? Thank you.

511
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,470
Where are you?

512
00:30:06,572 --> 00:30:07,916
<i>We're having a problem.</i>

513
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:09,189
I'm fixing it now.

514
00:30:09,291 --> 00:30:10,652
I've got a post-op Ortho patient

515
00:30:10,676 --> 00:30:13,393
on DVT prophylaxis with
a subdural hematoma.

516
00:30:13,512 --> 00:30:14,722
<i>Derek, she's got a blown pupil.</i>

517
00:30:14,746 --> 00:30:15,924
I'm not gonna be
there for a while,

518
00:30:15,948 --> 00:30:17,409
- so take care of it yourself.
- What?

519
00:30:17,433 --> 00:30:21,084
You wanted a solo surgery today?
Now's your chance. Take point.

520
00:30:21,187 --> 00:30:23,627
- I need loops and a headlight.
- Here you go, doctor.

521
00:30:26,791 --> 00:30:28,074
OK. Scalpel.

522
00:30:42,891 --> 00:30:45,225
If I root against him,
that make me a bad guy?

523
00:30:45,327 --> 00:30:47,928
The patient's a child, Mark.

524
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:50,510
All right, Karev. You got this.
If you don't, we're right here.

525
00:30:52,133 --> 00:30:54,551
All right, people,
here we go. Ten blade.

526
00:32:18,636 --> 00:32:19,886
OK.

527
00:32:19,988 --> 00:32:22,133
You're letting Kepner
lead the transplant panel?

528
00:32:22,157 --> 00:32:25,792
Yang's been useless.
She's no better than an intern.

529
00:32:29,782 --> 00:32:32,399
- Did you just stop
that bleeder?
- Uh-huh.

530
00:32:32,501 --> 00:32:35,886
How did you even
know to do that?

531
00:32:35,988 --> 00:32:37,682
- Hey. Sorry I'm late.
- It's OK.

532
00:32:37,706 --> 00:32:39,906
Lexie made a good call,
I've got it under control.

533
00:32:39,992 --> 00:32:44,578
- What do we got?
- Let me finish, Derek. I got this.

534
00:32:49,618 --> 00:32:51,551
Yes, you do.

535
00:32:55,724 --> 00:33:00,877
- I'm gonna find
a cure for Alzheimer's.
- The cure for Alzheimer's.

536
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:02,707
- With a million dollars.
- With a million dollars,

537
00:33:02,731 --> 00:33:06,666
- it's a start.
- You're talking
about a clinical trial?

538
00:33:06,768 --> 00:33:09,969
- A clinical surgical trial?
- Yes.

539
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:12,422
Start-up costs alone,
never mind the FDA, Derek...

540
00:33:12,524 --> 00:33:17,543
Today, I watched Meredith perform
an emergency craniotomy by herself.

541
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:22,865
She was perfect. She's
got her mother's talent.

542
00:33:22,967 --> 00:33:26,719
She's got her
mother's looks, Richard.

543
00:33:27,722 --> 00:33:31,258
What if she has her
mother's disease?

544
00:33:31,359 --> 00:33:35,261
Ellis was young when it started.

545
00:33:35,363 --> 00:33:40,199
Every time Meredith forgets her keys
or asks what day of the week it is, I...

546
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:45,866
When that million dollars runs out,
investors are gonna throw money my way

547
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:48,236
for the same reason I'm gonna
throw everything I've got at this trial.

548
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:53,079
Because their dad
has it. Or their wife.

549
00:33:53,182 --> 00:33:54,893
Breakthroughs don't happen
because of the medicine.

550
00:33:54,917 --> 00:33:59,419
Real breakthroughs happen
because someone is scared to death

551
00:33:59,521 --> 00:34:01,087
to stop trying.

552
00:34:10,182 --> 00:34:12,215
They're gone?

553
00:34:12,317 --> 00:34:16,186
Well, there's some swelling, but
that should go down with some time.

554
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:20,123
I don't have boobs.

555
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:23,777
- I don't have boobs?
- You don't have boobs.

556
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:28,048
- Mom?
- She was scared.

557
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:30,133
Now, she's just happy you're OK.

558
00:34:33,305 --> 00:34:37,323
- You're the man.
- No, you're the man.

559
00:34:42,113 --> 00:34:45,682
Roy Henley has end-stage
pulmonary hypertension.

560
00:34:45,784 --> 00:34:48,129
He has reached the point of
no return, and, at this point,

561
00:34:48,153 --> 00:34:52,021
nothing short of a lung
transplant will save him.

562
00:34:52,123 --> 00:34:54,157
Unfortunately...

563
00:34:55,693 --> 00:34:59,646
Unfortunately, his cultures revealed
that he has fungal pneumonia,

564
00:34:59,748 --> 00:35:02,415
his liver enzymes are worrisome,
and on top of everything else,

565
00:35:02,518 --> 00:35:04,534
his creatinine
clearance is only 75,

566
00:35:04,636 --> 00:35:07,637
which means that he is
on his way to kidney failure.

567
00:35:07,723 --> 00:35:11,958
The immunosuppressants after
surgery could very likely kill him.

568
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:14,177
And so, with regret,

569
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:18,831
I conclude that he does
not belong on the waiting list.

570
00:35:18,933 --> 00:35:22,185
Dr. Kepner, if you don't
believe he's a candidate,

571
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:24,871
why in the world would
you convene a panel today?

572
00:35:24,973 --> 00:35:28,508
That is a very
good question, chief.

573
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:32,145
I did think that he was a
candidate, earlier in the day,

574
00:35:32,247 --> 00:35:36,082
but the longer I
looked at his criteria,

575
00:35:36,184 --> 00:35:41,604
- the more glaring it became.
- It became glaring,
the more you looked at it?

576
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:48,461
Well, also, uh, new
facts came to light. Um...

577
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:51,764
The patient has
no support system.

578
00:35:51,866 --> 00:35:56,236
No one to take him for post-op visits
or make sure he complies with his meds.

579
00:35:56,338 --> 00:35:58,704
Earlier in the day, he
said he had a daughter,

580
00:35:58,807 --> 00:36:00,927
but later it came out
that they're estranged.

581
00:36:00,959 --> 00:36:05,861
- That's not a reason.
- Dr. Yang?

582
00:36:05,963 --> 00:36:07,430
Do you have something to add?

583
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:10,600
No.

584
00:36:10,702 --> 00:36:13,085
You don't believe that having
a support system in place

585
00:36:13,187 --> 00:36:15,149
is an important
factor in this decision?

586
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:17,556
It's one factor.

587
00:36:23,832 --> 00:36:26,032
But this guy is borderline,
that's why we're here.

588
00:36:26,134 --> 00:36:28,985
We could talk about
his criteria all day.

589
00:36:29,087 --> 00:36:32,538
His creatinine clearance
is low but not critical,

590
00:36:32,641 --> 00:36:36,743
and his fungal pneumonia
is bad but treatable.

591
00:36:36,844 --> 00:36:38,144
I mean, he's borderline.

592
00:36:38,246 --> 00:36:41,548
But I've been involved
in 27 transplant surgeries.

593
00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:46,135
And every time, the patient's will to
fight is just as telling and Roy has it.

594
00:36:46,238 --> 00:36:50,706
If we give him the lungs, it won't
be a waste, 'cause he will live.

595
00:36:51,776 --> 00:36:53,626
I know it.

596
00:37:12,046 --> 00:37:16,015
So how am I...? What am
I supposed to say to her?

597
00:37:16,134 --> 00:37:18,985
That I botched the insertion
and then I punctured the vessel?

598
00:37:19,087 --> 00:37:22,305
- Or maybe that
an error was made?
- You don't tell her anything.

599
00:37:22,407 --> 00:37:24,540
You made a mistake.
It happens all the time.

600
00:37:24,642 --> 00:37:27,121
I had to yell at you because
that's my job. My job now...

601
00:37:27,145 --> 00:37:30,146
Our job now is to go in
there with smiles on our faces

602
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:33,800
and tell her the surgery was
a success, because it was.

603
00:37:33,902 --> 00:37:38,204
- Hey! How are we?
- There they are! Our heroes!

604
00:37:38,306 --> 00:37:41,340
The ringing stopped. It stopped!

605
00:37:41,442 --> 00:37:44,877
- That's fantastic news.
- And the kid did good, right?

606
00:37:44,979 --> 00:37:47,479
The kid did good.

607
00:37:47,582 --> 00:37:49,932
I'm kissing you now.
'Cause I was wrong,

608
00:37:50,034 --> 00:37:53,969
but in this moment,
I am in love with you.

609
00:37:54,071 --> 00:37:56,472
Oh! Thank you.

610
00:37:59,544 --> 00:38:01,471
<i>We were supposed
to be a team today.</i>

611
00:38:01,495 --> 00:38:03,930
You told me what to say and
then you just turned on me?

612
00:38:04,048 --> 00:38:05,481
I didn't plan it.

613
00:38:06,334 --> 00:38:08,668
I'm not used to failing.

614
00:38:10,305 --> 00:38:11,871
Neither am I.

615
00:38:17,228 --> 00:38:19,395
You OK? All right.

616
00:38:21,366 --> 00:38:23,833
I know you think recommending
him was the wrong decision.

617
00:38:23,935 --> 00:38:26,936
I'm sorry, but I
just didn't agree.

618
00:38:27,039 --> 00:38:31,273
Cristina, in a case like
this, the right decision

619
00:38:31,376 --> 00:38:34,643
is making a decision. That's
what we do, that's the job.

620
00:38:34,745 --> 00:38:37,030
You formed an opinion
and you argued for it.

621
00:38:37,132 --> 00:38:40,466
And you weren't alone. The
panel voted to put him on the list.

622
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:42,535
Congratulations.

623
00:38:43,338 --> 00:38:45,821
You were a doctor today.

624
00:38:50,294 --> 00:38:51,961
Talk to me.

625
00:38:52,063 --> 00:38:55,064
Um, there is a broken CT
machine in the basement.

626
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:58,735
Next to it is a broken argon
laser and a broken fluoroscope.

627
00:38:58,837 --> 00:39:01,454
I think a million dollars
would repair all three of them.

628
00:39:01,556 --> 00:39:03,990
And there might even
be enough money left over

629
00:39:04,092 --> 00:39:08,077
to put a new nurse on the night shift,
which is what our patients really need.

630
00:39:10,715 --> 00:39:12,615
That's it?

631
00:39:12,717 --> 00:39:15,067
That's what you got for me?

632
00:39:15,169 --> 00:39:16,770
That's your best idea?

633
00:39:16,872 --> 00:39:20,623
This assignment couldn't
have been clearer. Inspiration.

634
00:39:20,725 --> 00:39:22,625
Good old-fashioned competition,

635
00:39:22,727 --> 00:39:25,973
not you coming in here telling me
I need to fix what's old and broken.

636
00:39:25,997 --> 00:39:28,615
Um, I would love to go to Paris.

637
00:39:28,716 --> 00:39:31,812
But you don't see me sitting
around, planning my Parisian vacation.

638
00:39:31,836 --> 00:39:34,303
It sounds nice,
but I am a mother,

639
00:39:34,406 --> 00:39:38,374
and what I really need to
do is get my kid to preschool,

640
00:39:38,476 --> 00:39:41,377
get the laundry done,
put food on the table.

641
00:39:41,479 --> 00:39:44,463
I can do a big tap dance here

642
00:39:44,565 --> 00:39:48,500
about how I'm gonna change the
face of medicine with a million dollars,

643
00:39:48,602 --> 00:39:51,304
but you can't do anything
with a million dollars.

644
00:39:51,405 --> 00:39:55,157
A million dollars is nothing.
That's a dream. This is real life.

645
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:57,210
Preschool. Laundry. Food.

646
00:39:57,312 --> 00:40:00,713
I'm realistic. Change
the face of medicine.

647
00:40:00,816 --> 00:40:03,316
We need to fix the medicine
that we already have.

648
00:40:03,418 --> 00:40:06,769
We need a new night nurse. We
need these broken machines repaired.

649
00:40:06,871 --> 00:40:10,139
Let's not go to Paris. Let's
go to the grocery store, chief.

650
00:40:12,193 --> 00:40:13,759
And while we're being honest,

651
00:40:13,862 --> 00:40:16,495
why are you wasting our
time with this exercise anyway,

652
00:40:16,597 --> 00:40:21,217
when you and I both know
you don't have a million dollars.

653
00:40:21,319 --> 00:40:26,005
Well, things may be a little different
around here in the next few weeks.

654
00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:40,469
Look at that.

655
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:45,140
Now, I can't call you
sourpuss anymore.

656
00:40:47,779 --> 00:40:50,012
Give me your arm, Roy.

657
00:40:50,098 --> 00:40:52,331
I have to draw some blood.

658
00:40:52,433 --> 00:40:56,202
<i>We all want to grow up.
We're desperate to get there.</i>

659
00:40:56,304 --> 00:40:59,272
<i>To grab all the
opportunities we can.</i>

660
00:40:59,374 --> 00:41:00,973
<i>To live.</i>

661
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:09,648
<i>We're so busy trying
to get out of that nest...</i>

662
00:41:13,455 --> 00:41:17,457
<i>we don't think about the fact
that it's gonna be cold out there.</i>

663
00:41:22,097 --> 00:41:24,196
<i>Really freakin' cold.</i>

664
00:41:25,367 --> 00:41:27,333
Thank you, sir.

665
00:41:27,435 --> 00:41:29,769
Congratulations. Good job.

666
00:41:33,257 --> 00:41:37,460
<i>Because growing up sometimes
means leaving people behind.</i>

667
00:41:52,177 --> 00:41:54,810
- Congratulations, doctor.
- Thanks.

668
00:42:00,685 --> 00:42:03,369
Oh, damn it. Where are my keys?

669
00:42:03,471 --> 00:42:06,072
- They're in your hand.
- Oh!

670
00:42:06,191 --> 00:42:09,408
<i>And by the time we
stand on our own two feet...</i>

671
00:42:11,212 --> 00:42:13,513
<i>we're standing there alone.</i>
