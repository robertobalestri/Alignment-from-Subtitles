1
00:00:02,336 --> 00:00:04,736
<i>The first 24 hours
after surgery are critical.</i>

2
00:00:04,822 --> 00:00:07,422
<i>Every breath you take,
every fluid you make</i>

3
00:00:07,541 --> 00:00:10,942
<i>is meticulously
recorded and analyzed,</i>

4
00:00:11,044 --> 00:00:13,545
<i>celebrated or mourned.</i>

5
00:00:13,647 --> 00:00:16,448
<i>But what about
the next 24 hours?</i>

6
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:21,453
So you and Cristina are going
fishing? Whose idea was that?

7
00:00:21,555 --> 00:00:23,988
Owen's concerned about
leaving Cristina alone,

8
00:00:24,091 --> 00:00:25,735
so when I told him I
was going fishing...

9
00:00:25,759 --> 00:00:30,245
Right. But you haven't
actually spoken to Cristina?

10
00:00:30,347 --> 00:00:33,682
- Actually, I have.
- You spoke to her? When?

11
00:00:33,784 --> 00:00:35,334
I called her last night.

12
00:00:35,435 --> 00:00:38,331
She must've been drunk or something
because she doesn't do the wilderness.

13
00:00:38,355 --> 00:00:40,433
I mean, there aren't even any
bathrooms in the wilderness.

14
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:42,469
Look, I know you're concerned
about her, but I also know that there's

15
00:00:42,493 --> 00:00:44,270
nothing else we
can do right now.

16
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:46,078
- But you can?
- Mm.

17
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:49,548
Because if fishing is your big
plan to get her back to work...

18
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:52,817
We're not trying to get her back to
work. We want to make sure she's OK.

19
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,221
Well, she's not OK and she's not going
to be OK until she gets back to work.

20
00:00:56,323 --> 00:00:59,425
- I know Cristina. She needs to work.
- Meredith...

21
00:01:01,028 --> 00:01:03,845
Well, I mean, she's
not gonna show today.

22
00:01:03,947 --> 00:01:05,707
I mean, she may have
agreed to it last night,

23
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:08,633
but in the cold hard light
of day, there's no way...

24
00:01:12,806 --> 00:01:16,174
<i>What happens when
that first day turns to two,</i>

25
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:20,979
<i>- and weeks turn into months?</i>
- You wanna do it? Real quick?

26
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:23,415
Nothing says good
morning like shower sex.

27
00:01:23,517 --> 00:01:28,687
I hope you don't take this the wrong way
because the sex with you has been great,

28
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:34,209
but... it just... It just
makes me miss Arizona.

29
00:01:34,311 --> 00:01:35,994
Sex with you just makes me sad.

30
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:40,415
- Oh, no, that
came out wrong. Sorry.
- No, I get it.

31
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:42,028
- Yeah?
- Last night,
when we were doing it,

32
00:01:42,052 --> 00:01:43,292
I was thinking about Lexie...

33
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,798
You were thinking about Lexie?

34
00:01:44,822 --> 00:01:47,272
I'm gonna need some
more consonants.

35
00:01:47,374 --> 00:01:49,419
When we were having sex,
you were thinking about Lexie?

36
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:52,494
- OK, now, that's just rude!
- You just said
having sex with me

37
00:01:52,596 --> 00:01:55,046
- makes you sad.
- 'Cause I'm amazing!

38
00:01:55,149 --> 00:01:58,433
I know! That's why I
suggested the wake up call.

39
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:01,220
Get out. Seriously, get out!

40
00:02:06,326 --> 00:02:09,378
- Now, I'm missing
Lexie even more.
- What was that?

41
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,763
- Nothing.
- I am amazing!

42
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:24,142
- Um, let me
give you a hand with that.
- Thanks.

43
00:02:27,114 --> 00:02:28,897
- Hey.
- Bye.

44
00:02:28,999 --> 00:02:30,649
Thank you.

45
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:42,127
<i>What happens when the
immediate danger has passed?</i>

46
00:02:43,364 --> 00:02:45,447
<i>When the machines
are disconnected</i>

47
00:02:45,549 --> 00:02:48,550
<i>and the teams of doctors
and nurses are gone?</i>

48
00:02:50,687 --> 00:02:53,588
- Well, I should go.
- Cristina!

49
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:04,082
There are no bathrooms...
out there, you know.

50
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:07,936
I know.

51
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:13,959
<i>Surgery is when you get saved,</i>

52
00:03:14,061 --> 00:03:18,563
<i>but post-op, after surgery, -</i>

53
00:03:18,665 --> 00:03:20,732
<i>is when you heal.</i>

54
00:03:20,834 --> 00:03:23,185
<i>But what if you don't?</i>

55
00:03:26,006 --> 00:03:30,442
You're removing a gallbladder
from someone's mouth. I mean,

56
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:33,528
no incision, no scar, it's
like you were never there.

57
00:03:33,631 --> 00:03:36,865
- Sorry, I'll stop talking.
- You want to do one of these?

58
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:42,737
- Is that a trick question?
- The trick is
how bad do you want it?

59
00:03:42,839 --> 00:03:45,707
Um... When I was
little, I wanted a pony.

60
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:48,176
Like, really, really
wanted a pony.

61
00:03:48,278 --> 00:03:50,428
This feels a
little bit like that.

62
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:51,791
Good. 'Cause I'm
having a contest.

63
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:53,526
Grabbing the gallbladder.

64
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:55,128
Each of you is researching

65
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:58,336
a different protocol aimed

66
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:01,807
at trying to eliminate fistulas.

67
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:04,475
But it's taking too long,

68
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:06,460
so this is the incentive:

69
00:04:06,563 --> 00:04:10,281
The person whose
protocol leads to the fewest

70
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:13,701
number of post-operative
complication,

71
00:04:13,803 --> 00:04:18,289
gets to pull a gallbladder
out of a mouth.

72
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:21,893
There she is. Beautiful.

73
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:24,312
- All righty.
- May I be excused?

74
00:04:24,415 --> 00:04:27,098
I am checking on my patients
every two hours and it's time.

75
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,282
Go ahead.

76
00:04:31,905 --> 00:04:35,423
- Uh, may I be excused, please?
- Uh, me, too.

77
00:04:35,542 --> 00:04:36,624
Go.

78
00:04:39,096 --> 00:04:40,428
Mm.

79
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:43,698
- You're a mad genius.
- If I was a genius,

80
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,168
I'd have rid the world
of fistulas by now.

81
00:04:51,408 --> 00:04:53,288
- Morning.
- Morning.

82
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:58,463
- How's Cristina?
- She's fine.

83
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:03,184
- She's fishing.
- She's fishing?

84
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,655
- Why?
- Ask him.

85
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:11,960
- Have you got any better ideas?
- No.

86
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:14,062
No. See ya.

87
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:20,352
How do I look?

88
00:05:20,454 --> 00:05:25,624
I'm about to propose to my
girlfriend. So besides the gown

89
00:05:25,726 --> 00:05:27,742
and the IV and
the ghostly pallor

90
00:05:27,844 --> 00:05:30,045
from being in the
hospital for the past week,

91
00:05:30,147 --> 00:05:32,180
what do you think?
Do I have a shot?

92
00:05:32,282 --> 00:05:34,799
She'd be a fool to say no.

93
00:05:40,891 --> 00:05:42,390
Good luck!

94
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:47,646
Hey, can either of you use me
today? I was supposed to be with Stark,

95
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:49,514
but he wants to work
with someone else.

96
00:05:49,616 --> 00:05:51,449
- Ouch.
- Guy's an ass.

97
00:05:51,552 --> 00:05:54,535
- Maybe heartlessness
is a Peds thing.
- No offense,

98
00:05:54,637 --> 00:05:57,172
but your girlfriend leaving
town really screwed me.

99
00:05:57,274 --> 00:05:58,668
I'm happy for
children of Malawi...

100
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:00,436
No, you should be
worried for them.

101
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,938
She's making them
fall in love with her.

102
00:06:01,962 --> 00:06:03,790
"Oh, I'll uncleft your palate,

103
00:06:03,814 --> 00:06:06,964
I'll unherniate your hernia.
I'm here for you, I'm yours."

104
00:06:07,067 --> 00:06:10,869
Then someplace better will come along,
Peru or India, and suddenly she's all,

105
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:12,715
"I know I was helping you
and I made you all kinds

106
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:14,889
- of promises..."
- "But I gotta go."

107
00:06:14,991 --> 00:06:17,575
"Have fun with Stark."

108
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:25,617
- Hi.
- Hi.

109
00:06:27,871 --> 00:06:29,921
- I miss you.
- Mark.

110
00:06:30,023 --> 00:06:31,450
What, are you saying
you don't miss me?

111
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:33,307
Pretty much what I'm saying.

112
00:06:34,177 --> 00:06:36,294
- You seeing someone?
- Yes.

113
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,246
His name is Andrew Rabb.

114
00:06:38,348 --> 00:06:40,832
He had a tumor removed from
his pancreas three days ago

115
00:06:40,934 --> 00:06:43,174
and I'm trying to make sure
he doesn't develop a fistula.

116
00:06:44,021 --> 00:06:47,388
Go. Cure fistulas. Or fistulae?

117
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,057
Fistulas.

118
00:06:50,127 --> 00:06:51,326
I miss you!

119
00:06:56,133 --> 00:06:57,732
Two minutes out.

120
00:07:01,604 --> 00:07:04,689
So, uh... you ever
go fishing with Derek?

121
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:09,077
I'm a surgical resident. When
would I have time for that?

122
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:12,247
- You get a day off
now and then.
- I spend my days off here,

123
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:14,149
- where she should be.
- Meredith...

124
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:17,685
What are your plans for her tomorrow?
Bowling with Bailey? Cooking class?

125
00:07:17,805 --> 00:07:19,615
Not sure. But...

126
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:21,573
bowling with Bailey,
that sounds fun.

127
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:28,713
Trina Paiz, 27, stable. Only
complaint is a lacerated ear.

128
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:32,650
Pretty amazing considering she
fell a hundred feet into a ravine.

129
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:34,672
Apparently, her
husband broke her fall.

130
00:07:34,721 --> 00:07:36,070
Jason Paiz, 27.

131
00:07:36,172 --> 00:07:38,534
- Jason! Is he OK?
- Grey,
take her to Trauma Two.

132
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:41,993
Please be OK. Please be OK.

133
00:07:42,095 --> 00:07:45,330
OK, Trina, do you
know where you are?

134
00:07:45,432 --> 00:07:48,133
A hospital in Seattle. I...

135
00:07:48,235 --> 00:07:51,218
I don't know the name, I'm not from
here. I'm here on my honeymoon.

136
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:55,006
- Oh, my God, my husband!
- Dr. Hunt is excellent,

137
00:07:55,108 --> 00:07:58,043
so he's in good hands. Do
you remember what happened?

138
00:07:58,145 --> 00:08:00,979
We were hiking up this
mountain and we wanted a picture,

139
00:08:01,081 --> 00:08:06,384
so we handed our camera
to some guy and we posed,

140
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,887
we kissed. No, we were kissing.

141
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:11,806
And then the next thing I
know I'm looking up at the sky,

142
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:16,411
and then we're on the ground,
or Jason's on the ground

143
00:08:16,513 --> 00:08:20,014
and I'm on top of him and...

144
00:08:20,117 --> 00:08:23,785
Please tell me he's not
gonna die. He can't die.

145
00:08:25,221 --> 00:08:28,206
- His wife is stable. Nervous, but...
- She should be.

146
00:08:28,308 --> 00:08:31,559
His abdomen is distended and
he has a lot of internal bleeding.

147
00:08:31,661 --> 00:08:32,994
Systolic's 60, Dr. Hunt.

148
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:34,757
Pressure's dropping.

149
00:08:34,781 --> 00:08:37,782
- Let's get him to an OR now. Quickly!
- Watch that line.

150
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:49,677
Grey, no time to scrub.
Come on. Gown me.

151
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,256
On three. One, two, three.

152
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,440
See if his type and
cross is back yet.

153
00:08:53,483 --> 00:08:56,333
In the meantime, get me some
FFP and Factor VII up here!

154
00:08:56,436 --> 00:08:57,669
Drape him.

155
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:00,438
Good.

156
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,491
- OK. Let's go. Ten blade.
- Ten blade.

157
00:09:05,195 --> 00:09:08,963
- I hope no one is wearing new shoes.
- - More laps.

158
00:09:13,587 --> 00:09:15,286
Laps! Laps!

159
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:22,438
- Grey, I can't see anything.
- - I'm suctioning.

160
00:09:22,462 --> 00:09:24,707
Suction's too slow, use
your hands. Another suction.

161
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:26,392
- How's his pressure?
- Seventy-nine over 40.

162
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:28,450
Ugh! He's like a
bucket full of holes.

163
00:09:28,552 --> 00:09:31,235
I'm gonna occlude
the aorta at the hiatus,

164
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:34,057
see if we can get his pressure back
up. How many units has he gotten?

165
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:37,308
Three units of O neg, one
unit A positive type specific

166
00:09:37,394 --> 00:09:40,005
- and one unit of FFP.
- Let's get some
more packs in there.

167
00:09:40,029 --> 00:09:42,930
Try and isolate this bleeder until
we figure out what we're dealing with.

168
00:09:43,032 --> 00:09:46,083
Laps. More. Keep
'em coming. More.

169
00:09:46,185 --> 00:09:49,003
More. Quickly! Faster! I don't
wanna have to keep asking!

170
00:09:55,462 --> 00:09:59,013
- Can I make a suggestion?
- - Yeah.

171
00:09:59,115 --> 00:10:02,016
If you mount the rod-holders
midship, we can both reach the rods

172
00:10:02,118 --> 00:10:04,201
from either end of the boat.

173
00:10:04,303 --> 00:10:06,438
After you called last
night, I did some research.

174
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:08,673
I didn't want to be anything
less than seaworthy.

175
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:11,709
- It's a lake.
- Still.

176
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:17,865
Uh, actually, it's,
uh... it's a great idea.

177
00:10:17,967 --> 00:10:19,495
You may need clip-on
mounts to clear the gunwales.

178
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,063
Are you gonna
be like this all day?

179
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:22,620
I can't help it.

180
00:10:26,576 --> 00:10:29,973
I've tried to avoid getting a new
hip because I just didn't want to deal

181
00:10:29,997 --> 00:10:32,497
- with the recovery, but...
- There's no cartilage left,

182
00:10:32,599 --> 00:10:34,782
- bone spurs...
- Our daughter's an orthodontist

183
00:10:34,885 --> 00:10:36,725
- in Sarasota.
- Hm!

184
00:10:36,819 --> 00:10:38,314
- Sheila.
- What?

185
00:10:38,338 --> 00:10:40,450
They should know that we
have medical people in the family.

186
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:43,775
- We're not nobodies
off the street.
- Mr. Cherkovsky,

187
00:10:43,877 --> 00:10:46,794
clearly you need a new hip.
Now, I've had a lot of success

188
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:49,664
with a new minimally
invasive technique. Dr. Karev?

189
00:10:49,766 --> 00:10:55,419
Well, she would use computer
guidance to avoid any excess radiation

190
00:10:55,522 --> 00:10:57,789
and she'd make a small
incision along the muscle

191
00:10:57,891 --> 00:11:00,425
so we would avoid
damaging the hip muscle.

192
00:11:00,527 --> 00:11:03,339
Now, I can fit you in this afternoon at
2pm and have you walking out of here

193
00:11:03,363 --> 00:11:06,898
- by the end of the week.
- Why does she have an opening?

194
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,583
- Why isn't she busier?
- What my wife wants to know...

195
00:11:09,685 --> 00:11:11,920
I heard her. I'm... I'm
standing right here.

196
00:11:12,022 --> 00:11:15,306
Um, actually, I'm just
coming off of some leave,

197
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:18,576
and so my schedule is flexible.

198
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,511
But, uh, I'm the only
surgeon in the Northwest

199
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:22,380
doing minimally invasive
hip replacements.

200
00:11:22,482 --> 00:11:24,899
Ask her why no one else
is doing it if it's so great.

201
00:11:25,001 --> 00:11:27,085
Because they can't and she can.

202
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:28,881
Tell them you want
a second opinion.

203
00:11:28,905 --> 00:11:30,638
- Sheila.
- No, no, no. You know what?

204
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:33,941
Actually, your wife's right. It's always
a good idea to get another opinion.

205
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:38,173
Call Dan Miller and see if he
can squeeze them in right now.

206
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:40,877
Maybe I should mention that
their daughter's an orthodontist.

207
00:11:40,901 --> 00:11:43,680
They're gonna meet with Miller,
hear about his six-week recovery period

208
00:11:43,704 --> 00:11:46,537
and come running back.
Keep my 2pm slot open.

209
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:48,539
We're gonna be
replacing Ron's hip.

210
00:11:49,692 --> 00:11:51,325
- Hey! Morning, Eli.
- Hey.

211
00:11:51,427 --> 00:11:54,188
Um, did you send Mr. Rabb's
sample of pancreatic fluid to the lab yet?

212
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:56,931
- Not yet.
- Uh, I asked
for it over an hour ago.

213
00:11:57,033 --> 00:11:59,395
Yeah, I was letting him rest.
He didn't sleep much last night.

214
00:11:59,419 --> 00:12:01,820
Dr. Grey. Check out Mrs. Kay.

215
00:12:01,922 --> 00:12:05,490
Day three post-op, no fistula.

216
00:12:05,592 --> 00:12:07,959
Already walking right
away, eating right away.

217
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:12,263
- Isn't that right, Mrs. Kay?
- Can I go back to bed now? I'm tired.

218
00:12:12,365 --> 00:12:13,698
One more lap.

219
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:18,536
- April.
- OK, there's no
evidence that shows

220
00:12:18,638 --> 00:12:20,666
that getting patients up faster
makes any difference at all.

221
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:23,658
How's it going with your
protocol? Looks like you... Oh! Hey.

222
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,293
Added just another medicine
to your drug regimen there, huh?

223
00:12:26,396 --> 00:12:29,814
Yeah, I mean, if you call
octreotide just another medicine.

224
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:33,067
So you're still, uh,
sticking with the little list?

225
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:35,536
Yeah. Standard post-op protocol

226
00:12:35,638 --> 00:12:37,638
with a checklist I've
developed for accountability.

227
00:12:37,707 --> 00:12:42,543
Oh, my gosh! So, you know what?
When I was little, I wanted a pony, too.

228
00:12:42,645 --> 00:12:44,145
And you know what happened?

229
00:12:44,247 --> 00:12:48,532
I, uh... I worked really
hard, and I got one.

230
00:12:54,924 --> 00:12:57,169
Mr. Rabb probably can't sleep
at night because you're letting him

231
00:12:57,193 --> 00:13:00,244
sleep during the day.
Get the fluid sample now.

232
00:13:09,773 --> 00:13:11,389
Hey. How'd it go?

233
00:13:11,491 --> 00:13:15,193
- Hey, uh, not so well.
- Oh.

234
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:16,839
- I'm sorry.
- No, I don't blame her.

235
00:13:16,863 --> 00:13:19,063
I was proposing for
all the wrong reasons.

236
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:20,931
I mean, I liked her and all,

237
00:13:21,034 --> 00:13:23,701
but what I liked most
about her was her PPO.

238
00:13:25,604 --> 00:13:28,622
- You don't have insurance?
- Capped out about
three operations ago.

239
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:30,669
I've been charging
it on my credit cards.

240
00:13:30,693 --> 00:13:33,978
- You mind if I look
at your chart?
- No, go ahead.

241
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:40,276
I'm warning you, though, it's
pretty scary stuff. Just saying.

242
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:45,256
Wow. Um...

243
00:13:45,358 --> 00:13:47,508
You have Von
Hippel-Lindau disease.

244
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:52,563
And you have been hospitalized
for over 200 days in the last...

245
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,715
- three years.
- Lotta good memories.

246
00:13:56,118 --> 00:13:57,318
Dr. Webber's your surgeon?

247
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:00,371
Not for long. They're
discharging me today.

248
00:14:00,473 --> 00:14:03,574
You have a pretty dangerous
tumor on your adrenal gland.

249
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:05,554
They're not gonna just
throw you out on the street.

250
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:06,911
Let me see what I can do.

251
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:10,348
I don't know how
much your fee is, uh,

252
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:12,969
but I know I can't afford it.

253
00:14:14,654 --> 00:14:18,622
I heard you just got married.
How'd you meet your husband?

254
00:14:18,725 --> 00:14:23,244
Uh, we worked together. There
was a no-dating policy at our firm.

255
00:14:23,346 --> 00:14:27,532
- Oh, my God.
- You're doing great. Keep talking.

256
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:32,270
He kept asking me out,
and he's just like that.

257
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:35,722
You tell him he can't do something,
it just makes him want to do it more.

258
00:14:35,825 --> 00:14:39,110
- Sounds like my kinda guy.
- And then there was this

259
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:41,295
work bowling party, and...

260
00:14:41,397 --> 00:14:44,164
we were both waiting in
line to return our shoes,

261
00:14:44,266 --> 00:14:47,684
and he just kissed me.

262
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:52,489
And then I was like, OK,
I need to find a new job,

263
00:14:52,591 --> 00:14:54,625
because he was a
really good kisser.

264
00:14:56,162 --> 00:14:57,629
Is.

265
00:14:57,731 --> 00:14:59,997
He is a really good kisser.

266
00:15:01,718 --> 00:15:02,984
His BP is still 70.

267
00:15:03,085 --> 00:15:05,264
With all these lap pads it
should be better by now.

268
00:15:05,288 --> 00:15:08,472
His pelvis and his spleen
look clean. It has to be his liver.

269
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:11,609
Try a Pringle maneuver, and
see if you can stop this bleeding.

270
00:15:11,711 --> 00:15:15,313
- OK.
- OK.

271
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,850
Damn it. That's what I was
afraid of. His vena cava is torn.

272
00:15:19,952 --> 00:15:21,368
You can let go.

273
00:15:25,074 --> 00:15:27,253
Dr. Hunt, what are we doing?

274
00:15:27,277 --> 00:15:30,494
- This is a lethal injury.
- He's on his honeymoon!

275
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:32,796
Pressure's still
dropping, 60 over 40.

276
00:15:34,283 --> 00:15:36,603
Dr. Hunt? What do we do?

277
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:41,386
Dr. Hunt.

278
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:45,292
Dr. Hunt, what's your plan?!

279
00:15:45,395 --> 00:15:47,473
You have to have a plan! We
can't stand here and do nothing

280
00:15:47,497 --> 00:15:49,241
while this guy bleeds out!
If you don't have a plan...

281
00:15:49,265 --> 00:15:54,234
OK, ten blade. It's a long
shot, but if we crack his chest,

282
00:15:54,336 --> 00:15:57,571
put in a shunt, bypass the blood
flow trying to get to the heart...

283
00:15:57,673 --> 00:16:00,842
will give us time
to make the repair.

284
00:16:02,262 --> 00:16:04,612
You don't get to talk to
me like that in my OR.

285
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:09,550
If you can't keep your problems, our
problems outside, then you should go.

286
00:16:09,652 --> 00:16:10,851
Bone saw.

287
00:16:23,116 --> 00:16:25,082
What is this?
Wait, don't tell me.

288
00:16:25,167 --> 00:16:28,285
Crankbait, best
used in muddy water.

289
00:16:28,955 --> 00:16:30,805
I know. Quiz me.

290
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:33,841
Is this a... spinnerbait?

291
00:16:33,943 --> 00:16:35,921
You know, the fish can hear you.

292
00:16:35,945 --> 00:16:38,190
Did you read about
that in your research?

293
00:16:38,214 --> 00:16:40,547
Fishing is supposed to be quiet.

294
00:16:42,268 --> 00:16:43,601
Is this a spinnerbait?

295
00:16:43,686 --> 00:16:46,554
I'm not quizzing
you. I'm fishing.

296
00:16:46,656 --> 00:16:48,622
You're no fun.

297
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:56,439
Maybe we should move the boat
over to the other side of the lake.

298
00:16:56,482 --> 00:16:57,781
No.

299
00:16:58,551 --> 00:17:00,718
This is a good spot.

300
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,920
For tanning maybe.

301
00:17:09,229 --> 00:17:12,863
Is this typical? I mean, to
go for hours without a bite?

302
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:17,335
The only thing predictable about
fishing is that it's unpredictable.

303
00:17:17,437 --> 00:17:19,103
Wow. That's deep.

304
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:21,905
Yeah, why don't you
ponder that for a while.

305
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:24,191
Quietly.

306
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:30,882
OK, I pondered it,

307
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:33,751
but the thing is, I don't
agree with the basic premise.

308
00:17:33,853 --> 00:17:36,353
Assuming a lake has fish
in it, which this lake does,

309
00:17:36,456 --> 00:17:39,523
and assuming that you're using the
right baits and lures, which we are,

310
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:42,943
you should be able to predict
getting more bites than, um,

311
00:17:43,045 --> 00:17:45,362
- like, none an hour.
- You know...

312
00:17:45,465 --> 00:17:47,905
Which leads me to believe
that the fish are elsewhere, like...

313
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,934
Like over there or
over there or over there.

314
00:17:51,036 --> 00:17:53,048
And if we were over there,
you would scare them away

315
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:57,024
with your incessant chatter.
Fishing is supposed to be quiet.

316
00:17:57,126 --> 00:17:59,894
And it's supposed to involve
catching fish, which we could do

317
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:04,164
if we moved the boat to where
the fish are... are sleeping...

318
00:18:04,266 --> 00:18:06,350
Just stop! Stop talking,

319
00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:10,037
stop worrying,
stop thinking. Stop.

320
00:18:10,139 --> 00:18:13,106
Can we... Can we just...?
Can we just try it my way?

321
00:18:13,209 --> 00:18:14,575
No!

322
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,999
I can't stop.

323
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:25,202
I can't turn my mind off.

324
00:18:25,305 --> 00:18:27,505
Yes, you can.

325
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:30,441
- But...
- But you can.

326
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:32,376
Just fish.

327
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,391
- Do it pro bono.
- Henry needs long-term medical care

328
00:18:47,494 --> 00:18:49,638
and the hospital just
can't afford to take that on.

329
00:18:49,662 --> 00:18:52,062
- So we do nothing?
- No, we treat him with drugs

330
00:18:52,164 --> 00:18:54,376
and we schedule regular
follow-ups at the clinic.

331
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,635
- You might as well do nothing.
- Look, I wish
I could treat him.

332
00:18:57,737 --> 00:19:01,755
- I really do. But my hands are tied.
- That is a load of crap.

333
00:19:01,857 --> 00:19:04,603
I have seen you bend the rules
around here. If I was Bailey or Shepherd,

334
00:19:04,627 --> 00:19:05,804
I'm sure that your
hands wouldn't be so tied.

335
00:19:05,828 --> 00:19:09,413
- Dr. Altman, that's enough.
- I'm sorry.

336
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:14,452
Cristina Yang is fishing today.

337
00:19:14,553 --> 00:19:17,793
She is one of the most talented
surgical residents I have ever seen,

338
00:19:17,857 --> 00:19:21,325
and she is fishing instead of
operating, and that is partly my fault.

339
00:19:21,427 --> 00:19:24,478
I just want to do
something good today.

340
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:27,731
Make it up, pay it forward,
whatever you want to call it.

341
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:31,285
I... I just need
to do some good.

342
00:19:35,758 --> 00:19:39,410
I'll set up a meeting
with the review board.

343
00:19:39,495 --> 00:19:41,412
Thank you.

344
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,311
Look, they met with
Dr. Miller three hours ago.

345
00:19:46,335 --> 00:19:47,780
- Give it time.
- They're not gonna call

346
00:19:47,804 --> 00:19:50,070
- 'cause they're idiots.
- Hey, where are you going?

347
00:19:50,172 --> 00:19:52,017
Going up to Miller's office to
tell him what idiots they are.

348
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:53,324
No, they're gonna call.

349
00:19:53,426 --> 00:19:54,619
Now, you're just being stubborn.

350
00:19:54,643 --> 00:19:56,527
Yes, I am being stubborn.

351
00:19:56,629 --> 00:20:00,264
I'm stubbornly choosing to believe that
sometimes people make sane decisions

352
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:02,967
like having minimally invasive
surgery when it's available.

353
00:20:03,069 --> 00:20:05,930
I am stubbornly choosing to believe
that not all people are evil and bad

354
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:09,222
and leave me in airports.

355
00:20:10,259 --> 00:20:11,959
Hm!

356
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,445
Told ya.

357
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:17,548
Good, shunt is in.
Secure it inferiorly.

358
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:19,695
- Umbilical tape.
- Here you go, doctor.

359
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:21,301
Now, we're gonna fix the IVC.

360
00:20:21,403 --> 00:20:25,456
I'm gonna lift the liver only enough
for you to gain access to the tear.

361
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:28,175
- You're gonna let me sew?
- Are you questioning
my judgment

362
00:20:28,277 --> 00:20:31,211
- or are you saying thank you?
- No, I just...

363
00:20:31,947 --> 00:20:33,425
- Thank you.
- Good.

364
00:20:33,449 --> 00:20:36,200
So, one stitch at a time.

365
00:20:36,302 --> 00:20:38,719
Slow and steady. Ready?

366
00:20:38,821 --> 00:20:41,371
OK. 3-0 Prolene.

367
00:20:41,474 --> 00:20:45,826
Mm... Anybody want my soup?
It's reminding me of pancreatic fluid.

368
00:20:45,928 --> 00:20:48,479
- Mm-hm. Then I
definitely want it.
- Sparkle.

369
00:20:49,732 --> 00:20:51,231
That was the name of my pony.

370
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:54,735
Dr. Kepner? Your patient, Mrs.
Hathaway, just came into the ER.

371
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:56,904
She's in septic shock.
CT showed a fistula.

372
00:20:57,006 --> 00:20:59,106
- Dr. Bailey wants you in OR 2.
- Mrs. Hathaway?

373
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:02,442
We just discharged her
three days ago, she was fine!

374
00:21:03,746 --> 00:21:06,106
And then there were two.

375
00:21:08,501 --> 00:21:10,000
Um...

376
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:12,169
Eli, I need another
sample of Mr. Rabb's fluid.

377
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,066
Uh, that's gonna be
tough. I took the drain out.

378
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:17,157
- You what?
- With the drain in,
he can't turn over,

379
00:21:17,259 --> 00:21:19,637
which means he has to sleep on his
back, which means he isn't sleeping.

380
00:21:19,661 --> 00:21:22,095
OK, just call Radiology.
We have to put it back in.

381
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:24,854
I need to be able to see the
fluid to tell if there's an infection.

382
00:21:24,934 --> 00:21:26,945
I can tell by looking at
it that it's not infected.

383
00:21:26,969 --> 00:21:29,298
- Call Radiology.
- If Dr. Bailey
wants it put back in,

384
00:21:29,322 --> 00:21:30,833
- then I will...
- No, she's in surgery.

385
00:21:30,857 --> 00:21:34,274
- Well, then it'll have to wait.
- Fine, I'll do it myself.

386
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:37,328
- You're not
touching that patient.
- Excuse me?

387
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:41,282
You have your list, but I have 12
years of experience that tells me

388
00:21:41,384 --> 00:21:43,995
that putting that drain back in
could actually put him at more risk

389
00:21:44,019 --> 00:21:48,439
for infection. Twelve years
I've been here. Twelve years.

390
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:51,875
You residents come and go, but
this is my home and you are my guest.

391
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:54,395
And right now, you
are no longer welcome.

392
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:08,492
- What's the emergency?
- Oh, uh, I need a favor.

393
00:22:08,594 --> 00:22:10,160
A nurse hates me.

394
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:13,230
You're a resident. I'm
sure all the nurses hate you.

395
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:16,283
- Yes, well, they love you.
- I think you love me.

396
00:22:16,385 --> 00:22:20,137
Fine. OK. Whatever. Can
you please just talk to him?

397
00:22:20,239 --> 00:22:22,751
Smooth things over so that when I
go to take my patient back to Radiology

398
00:22:22,775 --> 00:22:25,175
and get his drain put back
in, he doesn't make a scene.

399
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:28,662
Fine. I'll talk to him.

400
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:30,308
But you gotta meet me
at Joe's tonight for a drink.

401
00:22:30,332 --> 00:22:33,033
- You are unbelievable!
- That's why you love me.

402
00:22:33,135 --> 00:22:36,236
- 'Cause I'm unbelievable.
- You and I, we don't work.

403
00:22:36,339 --> 00:22:39,323
- OK? We've been through this.
- One drink.

404
00:22:42,661 --> 00:22:44,411
Fine. One drink.

405
00:22:45,814 --> 00:22:47,481
Oh! OK, there he is.

406
00:22:48,484 --> 00:22:50,450
- Eli?
- Uh...

407
00:22:50,552 --> 00:22:52,219
Two drinks.

408
00:22:52,321 --> 00:22:55,689
- Fine!
- Fine. Stay here.

409
00:22:58,778 --> 00:23:01,712
- Eli! You got a second?
- Yeah.

410
00:23:01,814 --> 00:23:06,250
Listen, I don't know what's going
on here, but I know better than

411
00:23:06,352 --> 00:23:10,388
to mess with you on your
turf, so do me a solid, nod

412
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:13,156
and act as if we're
having a big debate here,

413
00:23:13,242 --> 00:23:15,910
'cause Dr. Grey over there,

414
00:23:16,012 --> 00:23:18,963
she agreed to go out
with me if I talk to you.

415
00:23:19,047 --> 00:23:22,132
- She's bossy.
- I know. I dig it.

416
00:23:22,235 --> 00:23:25,269
Hm. What's in it for me?

417
00:23:25,371 --> 00:23:27,121
Seahawks, Sunday, box seats.

418
00:23:28,591 --> 00:23:31,024
- Parking? Mm-hm.
- Of course.

419
00:23:32,595 --> 00:23:35,963
OK. Unless Dr. Bailey herself

420
00:23:36,065 --> 00:23:37,965
orders that drain put back in...

421
00:23:38,067 --> 00:23:40,750
Now mention how
highly I think of her.

422
00:23:40,852 --> 00:23:43,548
I don't care if you think Dr. Grey is
the best resident you've ever seen

423
00:23:43,572 --> 00:23:47,357
- come through this program.
- I understand,
and I respect that.

424
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,459
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

425
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,734
I did what I could. What
time do you get off?

426
00:23:56,835 --> 00:24:00,186
What? That's it? You
didn't do anything!

427
00:24:00,288 --> 00:24:01,955
See you at 9:00.

428
00:24:05,327 --> 00:24:08,512
- You're going out
with Sloan tonight?
- One drink.

429
00:24:08,614 --> 00:24:11,710
And then you are gonna interrupt us
and tell me there's a medical emergency.

430
00:24:11,734 --> 00:24:13,067
There might be a
medical emergency

431
00:24:13,169 --> 00:24:16,003
if you don't get that drain
back in your guy. I'm just saying.

432
00:24:16,105 --> 00:24:19,190
I guess you can observe when
I'm taking out that gallbladder

433
00:24:19,292 --> 00:24:22,042
through a dude's mouth.

434
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:26,708
Dr. Hunt, I updated Mrs.
Paiz and checked your calls.

435
00:24:26,732 --> 00:24:30,061
Dr. Marshall from NYU called
about speaking at their conference,

436
00:24:30,085 --> 00:24:32,920
and the lab called with
results for your kidney patient.

437
00:24:33,022 --> 00:24:36,573
- That it? Nothing from my wife?
- No. That's it.

438
00:24:38,761 --> 00:24:41,361
You ready? Lifting the liver.

439
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,875
Dr. Miller can't fit
Ron in for three weeks,

440
00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:04,313
and we called our daughter in Sarasota
and she said maybe we should wait,

441
00:25:04,337 --> 00:25:07,270
but Ron wants it and I
just want what Ron wants.

442
00:25:07,373 --> 00:25:11,709
So, um, tell her Ron, tell
her we want this 2:00 slot.

443
00:25:11,811 --> 00:25:15,529
Oh, yeah. I wish I could,
but I'm already booked.

444
00:25:15,631 --> 00:25:18,132
- No, you're not.
- Yeah, I am. Yeah.

445
00:25:18,234 --> 00:25:20,584
That, um... fused knee thing.

446
00:25:20,686 --> 00:25:23,570
- Right, the guy with the knee.
- Yeah.

447
00:25:23,672 --> 00:25:27,274
Let me see if I can, uh,
switch some things around.

448
00:25:27,376 --> 00:25:28,616
I'd really appreciate it.

449
00:25:29,695 --> 00:25:31,462
Oh. What if I push
that down to later?

450
00:25:31,564 --> 00:25:34,899
You're getting that award
tonight, you can't miss that.

451
00:25:35,001 --> 00:25:37,717
Oh! That's right. Shoot.

452
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:42,422
OK, you know what? I'll do Ron
and I'll just be late for the dinner.

453
00:25:42,524 --> 00:25:46,593
I am so sick of those awards
dinners anyway. It's like...

454
00:25:46,695 --> 00:25:50,514
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

455
00:25:53,518 --> 00:25:55,919
- Eli.
- Dr. Bailey.

456
00:25:56,021 --> 00:25:58,066
Have I told you lately
how much I like your eyes?

457
00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:01,358
I am not in the mood. Why
did you remove the drain?

458
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:02,754
Because it was
ready to be removed.

459
00:26:02,778 --> 00:26:04,473
Now, I have to put
the drain back in.

460
00:26:04,497 --> 00:26:06,230
And write you up.

461
00:26:06,332 --> 00:26:09,132
- You said you were
gonna write him up.
- Let me handle this, Grey.

462
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:11,468
OK, Mr. Rabb is not
sleeping. That's a problem...

463
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:15,288
I feel for him, but this
protocol isn't just about him.

464
00:26:15,391 --> 00:26:16,834
I don't do protocols.
I treat patients.

465
00:26:16,858 --> 00:26:19,509
Eli, save your high and
mighty routine for someone else.

466
00:26:19,611 --> 00:26:21,573
Now, I'm sick of all these
post-op complications.

467
00:26:21,597 --> 00:26:24,648
I hate post-op complications
more than you do, Dr. Bailey. I do.

468
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:27,529
They're time-consuming and messy
and make it difficult for me to check up

469
00:26:27,553 --> 00:26:29,381
on my fantasy football
team as often as I'd like.

470
00:26:29,405 --> 00:26:31,015
So I make sure that my
patients don't get them.

471
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:34,090
You know you're
happy when I'm working,

472
00:26:34,192 --> 00:26:37,327
and it's not just because of my pretty
face, it's 'cause I'm good at what I do.

473
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:39,457
Think about it, when's the last
time you had a post-op complication

474
00:26:39,481 --> 00:26:42,049
with one of my patients? Hm?

475
00:26:42,151 --> 00:26:44,467
Good work.

476
00:26:44,569 --> 00:26:46,882
I think I can get
another stitch in.

477
00:26:46,906 --> 00:26:49,273
We can't risk it. There's
too much pull on the liver.

478
00:26:49,374 --> 00:26:51,219
- I'm lowering it.
- I want to try it.

479
00:26:51,243 --> 00:26:53,005
- No.
- There's not
as much blood in the field

480
00:26:53,029 --> 00:26:54,890
as before. He can
handle another stitch.

481
00:26:54,914 --> 00:26:56,992
- Remove your hand, Dr. Grey.
- Just another second.

482
00:26:57,016 --> 00:27:00,416
- Don't!
- Done. I got it. Lower the liver.

483
00:27:02,487 --> 00:27:04,904
- Get out of my OR.
- What? I did it.

484
00:27:05,006 --> 00:27:07,441
- See, he's fine.
- I'm not gonna say it again!

485
00:27:23,075 --> 00:27:26,510
No, I just got
kicked out of the OR.

486
00:27:26,612 --> 00:27:30,714
Because I'm just so sick of all
this. I'm sick of her not talking to me.

487
00:27:30,816 --> 00:27:33,133
I'm sick of you two
pretending to be friends.

488
00:27:33,235 --> 00:27:35,563
<i>- So put her on the phone.</i>
- Well, thank you, Dr. Keller.

489
00:27:35,587 --> 00:27:39,440
I think you did the right thing coiling
the aneurysm rather than clipping it.

490
00:27:39,542 --> 00:27:42,425
Thank you for the update
and I will check in with you later.

491
00:27:45,731 --> 00:27:47,965
- Was that Meredith?
- No.

492
00:27:49,768 --> 00:27:51,117
Yes.

493
00:27:54,789 --> 00:27:57,023
Oh, my God! Oh, my
God! I think I have a bite!

494
00:27:57,125 --> 00:28:00,877
I think I got a bite! What do I
do? What do I do?! Oh, my God!

495
00:28:00,979 --> 00:28:03,179
Stay calm. Sit down. Sit down.

496
00:28:03,231 --> 00:28:05,043
- OK, I'm sitting down.
- All right, good.

497
00:28:05,067 --> 00:28:07,801
I didn't read the part... what
to do when you catch a fish!

498
00:28:07,903 --> 00:28:09,497
- Let it run.
- What does that mean?

499
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:11,099
- Just stay right there.
- OK, OK.

500
00:28:11,123 --> 00:28:12,784
Let it go. Let the
fish run a little bit.

501
00:28:12,808 --> 00:28:14,719
- OK, go! Go, go, go, go!
- Give it some... There it is.

502
00:28:14,743 --> 00:28:17,255
- OK. Now what?
- Give it some line,
let it go. Easy.

503
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:19,396
- Let her tire herself out.
- OK.

504
00:28:19,498 --> 00:28:21,025
- Reel it in.
- Reeling it in.

505
00:28:21,049 --> 00:28:24,301
- OK, good, good.
- Oh, my God!

506
00:28:24,386 --> 00:28:28,021
Oh, my God! I'm
fishing! I'm fishing!

507
00:28:28,124 --> 00:28:31,141
- You're fishing!
- I'm fishing!

508
00:28:34,613 --> 00:28:36,747
OK.

509
00:28:36,849 --> 00:28:39,329
- You're good.
- - Yeah, tell that to Stark.

510
00:28:39,418 --> 00:28:42,802
Stark? Please, you don't
need Stark. You know why?

511
00:28:42,904 --> 00:28:45,138
In a year, everyone's
gonna want this surgery,

512
00:28:47,609 --> 00:28:49,709
except there's only one of me,

513
00:28:49,812 --> 00:28:52,913
unless I create another me.

514
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:55,699
That could be you.

515
00:28:55,801 --> 00:28:57,767
The guy me.

516
00:28:57,869 --> 00:29:00,336
Not as pretty, not
as good, but close.

517
00:29:00,438 --> 00:29:03,172
I could teach you, if you want.

518
00:29:04,343 --> 00:29:06,110
Screw Stark.

519
00:29:06,212 --> 00:29:10,079
Stark's loss is my gain.

520
00:29:10,181 --> 00:29:12,449
OK, Ron, here
comes your new hip.

521
00:29:16,304 --> 00:29:18,138
Can I talk to you for a second?

522
00:29:19,408 --> 00:29:21,975
- Uh, guys, give us the room.
- Yes, doctor.

523
00:29:29,084 --> 00:29:31,785
I knew what I was doing. I
knew I could do that second stitch.

524
00:29:31,887 --> 00:29:33,687
And you knew I could
do that second stitch.

525
00:29:33,789 --> 00:29:36,539
And if it were anyone else,
you would have let them do it.

526
00:29:36,641 --> 00:29:41,111
But because I questioned
how you handled Cristina,

527
00:29:41,213 --> 00:29:44,848
you chose to slap me down and
let everybody know who's boss.

528
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:47,190
You want to know what I
think? I think you're reckless.

529
00:29:47,286 --> 00:29:48,913
I think you're reckless
with your own life

530
00:29:48,937 --> 00:29:51,082
and today you were
reckless with a patient's life.

531
00:29:51,106 --> 00:29:54,107
I don't care who you are,
I don't want that in my OR,

532
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:56,388
and I do not want
that around my wife,

533
00:29:56,412 --> 00:29:59,379
who is struggling
just to hold on.

534
00:29:59,481 --> 00:30:02,382
Your wife is struggling
just to hold on

535
00:30:02,484 --> 00:30:04,101
because you married her

536
00:30:04,203 --> 00:30:08,455
and let it be OK for her
to completely fall apart.

537
00:30:08,557 --> 00:30:12,625
What is Cristina gonna do when she
gets back from her fishing trip tonight?

538
00:30:12,728 --> 00:30:16,163
Tomorrow, next week,
next month, next year?

539
00:30:16,265 --> 00:30:20,350
Because we'll all be here
working, and Cristina will be...

540
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:22,463
- Where?
- I don't know.

541
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:24,687
I don't know. But she has
the right to figure that out.

542
00:30:24,789 --> 00:30:26,935
You don't know. Well, I know.

543
00:30:26,959 --> 00:30:29,204
Because I know Cristina Yang.

544
00:30:29,228 --> 00:30:31,127
And she needs to work.

545
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:34,097
Because surgery is who we are.

546
00:30:34,182 --> 00:30:37,217
You told a guy with a gun to
shoot you. That is who you are.

547
00:30:37,319 --> 00:30:39,981
- What the hell
does that have to do...?
- You are fearless.

548
00:30:40,005 --> 00:30:42,706
And I don't mean
that in a good way.

549
00:30:42,808 --> 00:30:46,242
Most people don't tell the
guy with the gun to shoot them.

550
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:49,612
Most people are like Cristina!
Most people are afraid.

551
00:30:49,715 --> 00:30:52,432
So, what she needs
isn't what you need.

552
00:30:57,639 --> 00:31:00,039
She isn't you, Meredith.

553
00:31:02,077 --> 00:31:04,822
Well, he's right. His patient
records for the past three months

554
00:31:04,846 --> 00:31:08,315
show a post-op complication
rate way lower than the norm.

555
00:31:08,417 --> 00:31:12,302
Twelve percent compared
to 42 percent? Wow.

556
00:31:12,404 --> 00:31:15,405
OK, can you two stop being
impressed by him? It's a fluke.

557
00:31:15,507 --> 00:31:17,457
- He's mean.
- Hand me those charts.

558
00:31:17,559 --> 00:31:19,670
I think he's kind of hot. Can
you say that about a nurse?

559
00:31:19,694 --> 00:31:22,595
- No.
- Day three.

560
00:31:24,133 --> 00:31:27,200
Day... three.

561
00:31:28,403 --> 00:31:30,454
- Day three!
- Yeah?

562
00:31:30,556 --> 00:31:33,957
- Day three.
- Oh, oh, oh!

563
00:31:34,059 --> 00:31:36,359
OK, deep, deep breaths.

564
00:31:36,462 --> 00:31:39,396
Deep breaths. Ooh!

565
00:31:39,498 --> 00:31:42,165
- Dr. Bailey?
- OK. OK.

566
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:45,785
OK. Should we be following her?

567
00:31:45,887 --> 00:31:50,273
A medic alert bracelet?
That's your solution?

568
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:52,286
If the patient has a
hypertensive crisis...

569
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:55,895
When. When he has
a hypertensive crisis.

570
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:58,765
The paramedics will
bring Mr. Burton here,

571
00:31:58,867 --> 00:31:59,944
we'll treat his
emergent condition.

572
00:31:59,968 --> 00:32:02,486
That'll be too
late. He'll be dead.

573
00:32:02,588 --> 00:32:05,455
So you're sending him home
to die, but you're OK with it

574
00:32:05,557 --> 00:32:08,891
because you're giving him a
bracelet with his name on it.

575
00:32:08,994 --> 00:32:13,696
Hey! Um, if we remove the drain
on day three instead of day five,

576
00:32:13,798 --> 00:32:16,833
we can reduce the formation
of fistulas by 30 percent.

577
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:19,803
See, Eli took out a drain
when he wasn't supposed to,

578
00:32:19,905 --> 00:32:23,473
and I was gonna write him up
because he can't do that but he did.

579
00:32:23,575 --> 00:32:27,677
Ah! I'm going to leave
these files for you to look at.

580
00:32:29,798 --> 00:32:31,781
Oh! I'm sorry.

581
00:32:31,883 --> 00:32:36,086
I'm Miranda Bailey, the
doctor who cured fistula.

582
00:32:36,188 --> 00:32:37,838
That's right, I said it.

583
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:40,056
Uh, Jonas Salk, he cured polio,

584
00:32:40,141 --> 00:32:44,511
Miranda Bailey is
going to cure fistula.

585
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:50,350
Three! Day three!

586
00:32:55,106 --> 00:32:57,891
Twenty-eight pounds!

587
00:32:57,993 --> 00:33:00,494
That's one of the biggest
we've had this year.

588
00:33:00,596 --> 00:33:03,630
- Look at that!
- Do you want a picture?

589
00:33:03,732 --> 00:33:05,343
Oh! Definitely!
Definitely! Come on!

590
00:33:05,367 --> 00:33:07,550
All right. You pick it
up, I'll get the camera.

591
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:09,030
How am I supposed to pick it up?

592
00:33:09,054 --> 00:33:10,365
Just pick it up
with your gloves.

593
00:33:10,389 --> 00:33:11,629
It's very slippery. Be careful.

594
00:33:11,673 --> 00:33:14,407
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Yes!
- All ready, ready?

595
00:33:14,509 --> 00:33:17,009
- Oh, my God,
it's totally heavy!
- Ready?

596
00:33:17,112 --> 00:33:19,190
- Your friend's first time out?
- Yeah, first time.

597
00:33:19,214 --> 00:33:23,049
- She really is something.
- Yeah, she is. She really is.

598
00:33:23,652 --> 00:33:25,151
OK, smile now.

599
00:34:02,608 --> 00:34:05,458
It's OK. We don't
need the picture.

600
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,620
Take it.

601
00:34:06,644 --> 00:34:08,461
- Wait till she's...
- Take it now.

602
00:34:08,563 --> 00:34:10,363
We're gonna want
to remember this.

603
00:34:46,735 --> 00:34:48,585
Oh, my God!

604
00:34:50,455 --> 00:34:51,921
Jason, honey.

605
00:34:52,023 --> 00:34:56,393
We were able to repair the damage,
but the next 24 hours are crucial.

606
00:34:56,495 --> 00:34:59,529
But he can recover, right?
If everything goes OK,

607
00:34:59,631 --> 00:35:02,510
- he can fully recover?
- We're just focusing
on getting Jason

608
00:35:02,534 --> 00:35:04,167
through the night.
I know it's hard,

609
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:07,320
but try not to think
too far into the future.

610
00:35:07,422 --> 00:35:09,272
I'm afraid to touch him.

611
00:35:10,392 --> 00:35:14,193
I know right now all you
can see are the machines

612
00:35:14,313 --> 00:35:16,529
and the damage,
but he's still there.

613
00:35:38,003 --> 00:35:39,781
Hey! There's my star resident.

614
00:35:39,805 --> 00:35:43,072
- Come on,
we're drinking, I'm buying.
- Oh. Dude, sorry. I can't.

615
00:35:43,174 --> 00:35:45,392
- Why not?
- Stark ended up hating the guy

616
00:35:45,494 --> 00:35:47,171
who assisted him today
even more than he hates me.

617
00:35:47,195 --> 00:35:49,862
- Oh, God...
- Anyway, there's a midgut volvulus

618
00:35:49,965 --> 00:35:51,397
and I'm gonna assist.

619
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:55,685
- You're going back to Stark?
- The guy's a douche,

620
00:35:55,787 --> 00:35:58,120
- and hips are cool, you know.
- Just go.

621
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:07,897
I'm still awesome.

622
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:10,433
I've prescribed alpha blockers

623
00:36:10,535 --> 00:36:12,975
and set you up
in our free clinic.

624
00:36:13,037 --> 00:36:17,090
You need anything
at all, call me.

625
00:36:17,192 --> 00:36:20,576
- We're gonna
see you through this.
- Thank you.

626
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:31,504
Hey. Um...

627
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:37,594
- I tried. I'm sorry. I...
- I'll be OK.

628
00:36:37,696 --> 00:36:41,464
Dr. Webber slipped me some free
samples, so I'm good for a while.

629
00:36:41,566 --> 00:36:43,165
Good, good.

630
00:36:48,006 --> 00:36:49,506
Well, good luck.

631
00:36:58,916 --> 00:37:01,601
I have great medical insurance.

632
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,003
Way to kick a guy
when he's down.

633
00:37:05,857 --> 00:37:09,225
I'm saying, I'm...

634
00:37:10,662 --> 00:37:12,879
I'm saying that I'll marry you.

635
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:19,819
Uh...

636
00:37:21,089 --> 00:37:25,424
That's a really generous
offer, but I can't.

637
00:37:25,527 --> 00:37:28,027
I'm a doctor. I took an oath.

638
00:37:28,129 --> 00:37:31,376
And I can't leave you now
any more than I could leave you

639
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:34,067
bleeding out in the street.

640
00:37:36,855 --> 00:37:39,923
This is absurd.
You're aware of that?

641
00:37:42,661 --> 00:37:45,478
And you're gonna regret
it deeply in the morning.

642
00:37:49,651 --> 00:37:50,891
You're dying.

643
00:37:52,904 --> 00:37:54,337
Henry, you're dying.

644
00:37:54,422 --> 00:37:57,090
And you don't have
to, 'cause I can help.

645
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:00,510
I mean it.

646
00:38:02,514 --> 00:38:03,963
I'll marry you.

647
00:38:06,835 --> 00:38:11,420
I want all post-op drains
removed on day three from now on

648
00:38:11,523 --> 00:38:13,790
unless I tell you otherwise.

649
00:38:13,892 --> 00:38:17,260
Do you know what this
means? What you did?

650
00:38:20,281 --> 00:38:25,035
- What? What?
- Uh...

651
00:38:25,137 --> 00:38:28,521
I was wondering if you wanted to
go out with me sometime, Dr. Bailey?

652
00:38:28,623 --> 00:38:32,303
Even that shocked, "Oh, my
God, a nurse just asked me out,

653
00:38:32,377 --> 00:38:34,755
how the hell do I get out of it?"
expression you got on right now

654
00:38:34,779 --> 00:38:36,679
is pretty cute.

655
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:47,757
Fine. Because you
gave me day three.

656
00:38:47,859 --> 00:38:51,394
- And because I'm very handsome.
- Yeah.

657
00:39:09,197 --> 00:39:10,774
I know I agreed to
have a drink with you,

658
00:39:10,798 --> 00:39:15,268
but as I walked here I
realized how unfair that was.

659
00:39:15,370 --> 00:39:18,388
It's unfair to you,
it's unfair to me,

660
00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:22,625
because, really, nothing
has changed. I mean...

661
00:39:22,727 --> 00:39:25,127
You're still in a very
different place in your life

662
00:39:25,229 --> 00:39:27,446
than I am and
you want different...

663
00:39:27,548 --> 00:39:31,984
<i>The goal of any
surgery is total recovery.</i>

664
00:39:33,054 --> 00:39:35,922
<i>To come out better
than you were before.</i>

665
00:39:37,291 --> 00:39:40,560
<i>Some patients heal quickly
and feel immediate relief.</i>

666
00:39:47,302 --> 00:39:50,703
Lexie? I just got a page.
Bailey wants us back in the ICU.

667
00:39:50,806 --> 00:39:53,089
Can you deal with it, please?

668
00:40:02,049 --> 00:40:04,834
- Hey.
- Hey!

669
00:40:06,571 --> 00:40:08,654
I have 21 pounds of trout.

670
00:40:11,009 --> 00:40:12,742
How was it?

671
00:40:18,417 --> 00:40:19,615
It was good.

672
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:35,164
<i>For others, the healing
happens gradually,</i>

673
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:38,767
<i>and it's not until months
or even years later</i>

674
00:40:38,869 --> 00:40:41,870
<i>that you realize you
don't hurt anymore.</i>

675
00:40:43,475 --> 00:40:45,953
Do you think Cristina's
gonna be OK?

676
00:40:45,977 --> 00:40:48,811
Mm. Yeah. I do.

677
00:40:51,516 --> 00:40:54,036
Do you think she's
gonna be a surgeon?

678
00:40:56,087 --> 00:40:57,920
Honestly?

679
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:01,257
I don't know.

680
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:12,268
<i>So the challenge after
any surgery is to be patient.</i>

681
00:41:15,173 --> 00:41:17,957
Mark, did you forget your keys?

682
00:41:19,427 --> 00:41:22,461
OK, so picture this: I'm in
Africa, everything's great.

683
00:41:22,563 --> 00:41:25,631
The people are so nice, and the
clinic is amazing and I'm doing work

684
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:28,301
that actually feels important,
like I can actually see

685
00:41:28,403 --> 00:41:31,804
that I'm making a difference.
But I'm crying, like, constantly.

686
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:34,685
And then this guy that I work with at
the clinic finally asks me what's wrong

687
00:41:34,709 --> 00:41:38,327
and I say that I miss my
girlfriend. Like, I really miss her.

688
00:41:38,429 --> 00:41:41,264
So then he asks me if I want to
go back, if they could replace me,

689
00:41:41,366 --> 00:41:45,167
and then I opened my mouth to say
no, but what comes out weirdly instead

690
00:41:45,269 --> 00:41:47,270
is yes.

691
00:41:47,772 --> 00:41:49,906
And so they did.

692
00:41:50,008 --> 00:41:51,357
And then I came back.

693
00:41:55,997 --> 00:41:57,763
And you look really pretty.

694
00:41:57,865 --> 00:42:02,252
<i>But if you can make it through
the first weeks and months,</i>

695
00:42:02,354 --> 00:42:04,570
<i>if you believe that
healing is possible...</i>

696
00:42:11,646 --> 00:42:13,563
<i>then you can get your life back.</i>

697
00:42:18,853 --> 00:42:20,786
<i>But that's a big if.</i>
