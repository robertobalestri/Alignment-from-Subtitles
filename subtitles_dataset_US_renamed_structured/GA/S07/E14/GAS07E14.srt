1
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:03,981
<i>One of the hardest
lessons as a doctor</i>

2
00:00:04,005 --> 00:00:06,087
<i>is learning to prioritize.</i>

3
00:00:06,189 --> 00:00:08,440
Truck.

4
00:00:08,542 --> 00:00:10,342
Cabin.

5
00:00:10,444 --> 00:00:12,093
Spoon.

6
00:00:12,195 --> 00:00:13,862
Truck.

7
00:00:13,964 --> 00:00:15,531
Cabin.

8
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:19,334
- Spoon.
- Very good.

9
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:22,955
<i>We're trained to do all we
can to save life and limb,</i>

10
00:00:23,057 --> 00:00:26,374
<i>but if cutting off a limb means
saving a life we learn to do it,</i>

11
00:00:26,476 --> 00:00:28,454
<i>- without hesitation.</i>
- Several moments ago,

12
00:00:28,478 --> 00:00:31,864
I asked you to remember three
words. Can you tell me what they were?

13
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,769
Truck, cabin, spoon.

14
00:00:37,872 --> 00:00:41,240
The three words I asked you
to remember, what were they?

15
00:00:41,342 --> 00:00:45,544
<i>It's not an easy lesson to learn. And
it always comes down to one question:</i>

16
00:00:45,646 --> 00:00:48,046
<i>What are the stakes?</i>

17
00:00:48,982 --> 00:00:50,682
Truck.

18
00:00:51,602 --> 00:00:53,385
Cabin?

19
00:00:55,689 --> 00:00:56,750
And the third word?

20
00:00:56,774 --> 00:00:59,007
<i>What do we stand
to gain or lose?</i>

21
00:00:59,109 --> 00:01:02,928
<i>At the end of the day we're just
gamblers, trying not to bet the farm.</i>

22
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,746
- Spoon.
- Spoon.

23
00:01:04,848 --> 00:01:07,415
- Spoon.
- Excellent.

24
00:01:12,022 --> 00:01:14,339
Chief, you paged.

25
00:01:14,441 --> 00:01:16,658
- Hey.
- How's it going?

26
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:19,655
Well, the word "spoon" has
ceased to have any meaning for me,

27
00:01:19,679 --> 00:01:23,415
but I'm through the first test set. I
have a few more consults today, but...

28
00:01:23,517 --> 00:01:27,168
- What's up?
- Meredith,

29
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:29,638
I would like to
initiate a clinical trial,

30
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:33,124
one that would be the next
major advancement in the fight

31
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:36,828
- to cure Type 1 diabetes.
- Wow.

32
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,815
And I'd like you to participate.

33
00:01:39,917 --> 00:01:43,418
But I am on Derek's
Alzheimer's trial.

34
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,638
- So I don't think
I can do both.
- Just listen.

35
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,975
The basis of this trial was
something that I found in here.

36
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:52,477
- In my mother's journals?
- Yes.

37
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:56,464
She was working on islet cell
transplantation when she became ill.

38
00:01:56,566 --> 00:02:00,785
Trying to eliminate the need
for anti-rejection meds altogether.

39
00:02:00,887 --> 00:02:04,840
With her notes, drugs
and new technology,

40
00:02:04,942 --> 00:02:07,776
there's no way we can't take this
the rest of the way down the field.

41
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:11,163
- "We?"
- Well, it's your mother's work.

42
00:02:11,265 --> 00:02:15,233
I wouldn't feel right moving
forward if you weren't a part of it.

43
00:02:15,318 --> 00:02:19,171
You should look at them
both. Just think about it.

44
00:02:19,273 --> 00:02:20,972
It's your decision.

45
00:02:24,461 --> 00:02:28,146
It's your birthright, Meredith.
It's your mother's legacy to you.

46
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:40,558
- What is it?
- It's a kale
and apple juice smoothie.

47
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,593
It's time to think less
about your cravings

48
00:02:42,696 --> 00:02:44,991
and more about filling that baby
with nutrients, which that has.

49
00:02:45,015 --> 00:02:48,183
It also has chunks. I don't
drink chunks. I want my coffee.

50
00:02:48,285 --> 00:02:52,921
Mark, tell the woman. I'm allowed
to drink one cup of regular coffee.

51
00:02:53,023 --> 00:02:54,767
- Sure, you are.
- Mark, are you aware

52
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:57,576
that there are studies that
link caffeine with pre-term labor,

53
00:02:57,678 --> 00:03:00,145
low-birth weight,
other birth defects?

54
00:03:00,247 --> 00:03:03,882
That goo looks great. I
say you stick with the goo.

55
00:03:03,984 --> 00:03:06,585
You two can't just dictate what
I'm allowed to eat and drink.

56
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:08,786
Nobody's dictating anything,
but you're pregnant now,

57
00:03:08,889 --> 00:03:10,705
so things have to be different.

58
00:03:10,807 --> 00:03:13,036
You're gonna have to eat
better and take it easier at work.

59
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:15,376
If it helps, we'll
give up caffeine, too.

60
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:19,281
- That helps no one.
- How about we put it to a vote?

61
00:03:19,383 --> 00:03:22,951
All in favor of Callie drinking
coffee, raise your hand.

62
00:03:23,053 --> 00:03:25,187
All in favor of the goo?

63
00:03:27,757 --> 00:03:29,006
Goo, it is.

64
00:03:36,733 --> 00:03:40,319
- It's horrible.
- It's the opposite of horrible.

65
00:03:40,421 --> 00:03:44,106
- Alzheimer's or diabetes?
- If you continue
to whine about how

66
00:03:44,207 --> 00:03:46,686
you can't decide which
ground-breaking medical advancement

67
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:48,688
to put your name on, I
will punch you in the ear.

68
00:03:48,712 --> 00:03:51,596
Well, my name's already on
one of them, according to the chief.

69
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:55,099
- I mean, diabetes...
- Affects 240 million
people worldwide.

70
00:03:55,201 --> 00:03:59,036
- And Alzheimer's is...
- The seventh leading
cause of death.

71
00:03:59,139 --> 00:04:02,774
- It's<i> Sophie's Choice.</i>
- It's<i> Sophie's Choice.</i>

72
00:04:02,876 --> 00:04:05,021
- I've never seen that movie.
- You should. It's really funny.

73
00:04:05,045 --> 00:04:08,780
Greys. How long has your father
been having abdominal pain?

74
00:04:08,882 --> 00:04:11,800
- Abdominal pain?
- It sounds like abdominal pain.

75
00:04:11,902 --> 00:04:14,152
Thatcher Grey is not an easy
man to get information from.

76
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:17,673
- Our father's
here in the hospital?
- I admitted him an hour ago.

77
00:04:17,775 --> 00:04:21,960
- You didn't know he was coming?
- What's wrong?

78
00:04:22,062 --> 00:04:23,606
Could it be related
to the liver transplant?

79
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:26,815
Of course, he's rejecting
it because it's my liver.

80
00:04:26,917 --> 00:04:28,950
OK, look, just do me a favor,

81
00:04:29,052 --> 00:04:32,270
go take a blood sample and try to
get some more information out of him.

82
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:35,623
- I need someone
who speaks "Grey".
- Yeah.

83
00:04:37,627 --> 00:04:39,728
Hey, stranger.

84
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:45,883
Meredith has two ground-breaking
clinical trials, and I don't have any.

85
00:04:45,986 --> 00:04:47,869
OK, but you have a
husband that loves you.

86
00:04:47,971 --> 00:04:53,141
- Well, so does she.
- Then... Then I guess you're
screwed.

87
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:06,504
Hello? NICU.

88
00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:11,075
I thought I knew all
the nurses on this floor.

89
00:05:11,177 --> 00:05:14,011
- How did I miss you?
- Guess I'm just lucky that way.

90
00:05:14,113 --> 00:05:17,015
- I'm Alex Karev.
- Neat.

91
00:05:17,117 --> 00:05:21,002
- And you are...?
- Not telling you my name.

92
00:05:21,105 --> 00:05:24,922
- Any reason why not?
- Because I don't want to.

93
00:05:25,025 --> 00:05:28,193
OK. Then how about you
pass me one of those charts?

94
00:05:28,295 --> 00:05:31,145
I hear there's a turnip
in the cabbage patch.

95
00:05:32,682 --> 00:05:35,533
- Turnip?
- Gorked. Brain-dead.

96
00:05:35,635 --> 00:05:38,920
Dr. Robbins and I have a baby
with a hypoplastic left heart.

97
00:05:39,022 --> 00:05:42,274
- The transplant coordinator...
- Suggested the... turnip

98
00:05:42,376 --> 00:05:44,659
- as a potential donor.
- Yeah.

99
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:46,060
Uh-huh.

100
00:05:46,162 --> 00:05:49,564
Well, now you do get to know
my name. I'm Dr. Lucy Fields.

101
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:53,451
I delivered that gorked baby.
So thanks for the heads-up.

102
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:56,755
I'll talk to the transplant coordinator.
But now you need to leave.

103
00:05:56,857 --> 00:06:00,225
Come on. That's no
reason to overreact.

104
00:06:00,327 --> 00:06:04,929
Really? Well, now you're barred from
the NICU. How's that for overreacting?

105
00:06:05,015 --> 00:06:08,549
- You can't do that.
- Wanna find out?

106
00:06:20,763 --> 00:06:23,098
- What do we have here?
- You really don't want to know.

107
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:27,602
Let me get that for you,
Dr. Torres. OK, Randy Shouse, 23,

108
00:06:27,704 --> 00:06:31,573
multiple injuries after slamming
into a brick wall? How did...?

109
00:06:31,675 --> 00:06:34,976
Idiot and his idiot buddies
built a human slingshot.

110
00:06:35,078 --> 00:06:37,873
I wasn't supposed to hit the wall. I
was supposed to fly over the house

111
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:41,266
- and land in the pool.
- But why would you do that?

112
00:06:41,368 --> 00:06:43,029
So they could film it,
put it on the Internet

113
00:06:43,053 --> 00:06:45,720
and show the world just
how stupid they actually are.

114
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:48,723
Dude!

115
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:50,324
Did you get that?

116
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:53,144
Yeah, buddy!

117
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:56,014
- But why?
- Because it's hilarious,
that's why.

118
00:06:56,116 --> 00:06:58,344
OK, Randy. That must've been
some kind of awesome slingshot

119
00:06:58,368 --> 00:07:00,868
because it looks like
you've dislocated both hips.

120
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:03,330
- I'm gonna need to get
some X-rays.
- I'm on it!

121
00:07:04,858 --> 00:07:09,494
- Wow, she's perky.
- Better than stupid
with a death wish.

122
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:11,624
You're sick enough that you
need to come into the hospital,

123
00:07:11,648 --> 00:07:14,248
- and you don't even call me?
- The pain comes and goes.

124
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:16,896
- I didn't want to...
- So you thought you'd
just sneak in

125
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,081
and quietly reject Meredith's
liver? Not even make a fuss?

126
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:22,674
- Please, calm down. Please?
- I am calm.

127
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:24,809
I'm so calm. I'm,
like, the calmest one.

128
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:29,897
OK, good. Because there's
something else I should've told you.

129
00:07:29,999 --> 00:07:33,368
- I go to AA a couple
of times a week.
- Yes, that I know.

130
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:35,470
No, I know you
know. But sometimes,

131
00:07:35,505 --> 00:07:38,317
you have to get up in front of
the group and you say your piece.

132
00:07:38,341 --> 00:07:40,153
And then people sometimes
come up to you afterwards

133
00:07:40,177 --> 00:07:43,912
and say that they liked what you
said. Then maybe you go to coffee

134
00:07:44,014 --> 00:07:45,458
- with them afterward.
- Like a sponsor?

135
00:07:45,482 --> 00:07:47,749
No, not a sponsor. How do I...?

136
00:07:47,851 --> 00:07:51,319
There you are! Sorry, I got turned
around and ended up back in the lobby.

137
00:07:51,421 --> 00:07:52,704
No, no, no!

138
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:56,274
- No, no, no!
- Oh, God, what? Sorry. Are you in pain?

139
00:07:57,945 --> 00:08:01,329
Yeah. Not a sponsor.

140
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:14,693
I'm so sorry, this was not the
way that I wanted to meet you.

141
00:08:14,795 --> 00:08:15,922
I didn't even know
there was a you to meet.

142
00:08:15,946 --> 00:08:18,579
I know. I'm sorry, but...

143
00:08:18,681 --> 00:08:21,232
OK, Mr. Grey. Oh, hello.

144
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:24,785
- Dr. Bailey, this is Danielle.
- Dani. Hi.

145
00:08:24,887 --> 00:08:28,573
Yes, Dani. It's my father's girlfriend,
whom I've just met, just now.

146
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:33,928
Oh, I see. Nice
to meet you, Dani.

147
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:37,248
I just have a few questions,
and then I will let you get back to...

148
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,417
- all of this.
- Do you really think I could be

149
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,620
rejecting this liver? Because
Dani has been amazing

150
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:45,406
helping me take care of myself.
And I'm constantly taking pills.

151
00:08:45,526 --> 00:08:49,077
His anti-rejection meds.
Not, like, speed or anything.

152
00:08:49,179 --> 00:08:50,712
'Cause that would
be inappropriate.

153
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:55,834
- When did the pain start?
- Twelve days ago.

154
00:08:55,936 --> 00:08:59,303
- She's good with the details.
- Any fevers

155
00:08:59,405 --> 00:09:02,541
or changes in
your urine or stool?

156
00:09:02,643 --> 00:09:06,578
No fevers. But there was a...

157
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,814
pain incident last
week. Thursday.

158
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:12,516
Actually, you might not
want to hear this part.

159
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:14,735
I'm a doctor.

160
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:19,223
All right. Well, we
were being intimate.

161
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:22,160
- Oh, no...
- And I was on top...

162
00:09:22,262 --> 00:09:24,545
OK.

163
00:09:27,617 --> 00:09:29,116
Go on.

164
00:09:31,104 --> 00:09:34,639
Dr. Avery, it's about time
I had you on my service.

165
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:36,407
Thank you,
Dr. Sloan. I gotta say,

166
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:38,187
I really think I have
the hands for plastics.

167
00:09:38,211 --> 00:09:40,712
Forget about your hands.
Look at those cheekbones.

168
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:42,547
- Sir?
- You're genetically blessed.

169
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:45,683
Don't think I haven't noticed.
Speaking from personal experience,

170
00:09:45,785 --> 00:09:48,319
I can say that that'll only
help you in plastics. That face?

171
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,099
Better than a hundred
billboards, my man.

172
00:09:50,123 --> 00:09:51,789
All right, Dr. Sloan, I...

173
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:54,811
really don't feel comfortable being
judged or praised based on my looks.

174
00:09:54,911 --> 00:09:57,128
Oh, poor Mr. Green Eyes.

175
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:59,980
Let's not pretend being
beautiful's a burden.

176
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:03,200
Now, come on. Mrs. Johnson's
nose isn't gonna fix itself.

177
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,672
How about a little sparkle?

178
00:10:09,593 --> 00:10:12,610
There it is.

179
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:17,198
Hip dislocation, fractures of his
femur, radius, ribs and metacarpals.

180
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:20,251
OK. Should we just go
ahead and reduce those hips?

181
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:22,837
Kepner, I need you
to speak differently.

182
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:25,651
- I'm sorry?
- Your voice. It's a little...

183
00:10:25,675 --> 00:10:27,291
Just speak differently.

184
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:32,241
- Like with an accent?
- Never mind. You know,

185
00:10:32,265 --> 00:10:34,185
how about you get me a
muffin from the cafeteria?

186
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:37,351
Get me the sugary-est kind
you can find. And some coffee.

187
00:10:38,154 --> 00:10:40,538
Wait. No. Damn it.

188
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,440
- No coffee.
- OK.

189
00:10:43,543 --> 00:10:46,127
No, you know what? Yes. Coffee.

190
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:48,763
- Please.
- Great.

191
00:10:48,865 --> 00:10:51,632
Crap! No. No coffee.

192
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:54,068
- You're sure?
- No. No coffee. Just...

193
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:57,806
- Just go.
- OK.

194
00:11:02,511 --> 00:11:05,045
- Did you still want the muffin?
- Yes.

195
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:13,354
Yes, I know I'm not Dr. Bailey, but
he's my father and I need his lab results.

196
00:11:13,456 --> 00:11:15,434
- Sorry, I can't do it.
- OK. Well, then maybe

197
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:17,920
I'll just let your supervisor know
that I've been highly unsatisfied

198
00:11:17,944 --> 00:11:19,872
- with your service today.
- This isn't the mall.

199
00:11:19,896 --> 00:11:22,830
- We don't have comment cards.
- Well, maybe you should!

200
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:26,351
- Hey. You OK? Need me to talk to him?
- Mark, no.

201
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:29,453
My day has been too messed
up to have you in it, too.

202
00:11:43,336 --> 00:11:45,436
Son of a bitch.

203
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:48,255
We know, without a doubt,
that this heart is a viable option.

204
00:11:48,358 --> 00:11:50,558
How? How do we know
that this a good match?

205
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:53,744
Babies under a year haven't
developed an immune system

206
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:57,097
that will reject the new organ.
It makes matching a lot easier.

207
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,269
But we're still four weeks
away from the due date.

208
00:12:01,371 --> 00:12:03,370
Our OB isn't even
in town right now.

209
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:05,751
I'm covering for Dr. Napolitano.

210
00:12:05,775 --> 00:12:08,954
I've got her blessing to go
ahead and do the C-section today.

211
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:11,179
Today?

212
00:12:11,281 --> 00:12:13,982
- That's really...
- Colin, time's an issue here.

213
00:12:14,084 --> 00:12:15,912
We need to inform the transplant
board as soon as possible

214
00:12:15,936 --> 00:12:18,547
if you want this heart. Otherwise
it's gonna go to another family.

215
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,688
OK. You know what?

216
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:22,518
There are a lot of doctors
in the room right now,

217
00:12:22,542 --> 00:12:24,653
so why don't we give
the Cookes some space?

218
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:27,317
You can have one of the nurses
page us when you've made a decision.

219
00:12:34,904 --> 00:12:36,464
What's going on? Why
didn't you page me?

220
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:39,557
- Turnip, Karev?
- You tattled on me?

221
00:12:39,659 --> 00:12:41,976
- You are so off this case.
- Seriously?

222
00:12:42,078 --> 00:12:46,096
- I have said way
worse stuff than that.
- Yeah, not helping.

223
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:50,418
Are you kidding me?

224
00:12:59,746 --> 00:13:01,791
Avery, you want to give
the osteotomies a shot?

225
00:13:01,815 --> 00:13:05,650
Yes, sir. Mallet, please.

226
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,804
You live with Lexie
Grey now, right?

227
00:13:09,906 --> 00:13:12,390
- How's she doing these days?
- OK, I guess.

228
00:13:12,492 --> 00:13:15,492
OK? She hasn't seemed upset?

229
00:13:15,594 --> 00:13:18,896
I mean, she kind of cries
sometimes. But she seems OK.

230
00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:20,860
Now, are you gonna strip
the lateral cartilage here?

231
00:13:20,884 --> 00:13:24,852
- Crying seems fine?
- She's a girl. Girls cry.

232
00:13:24,954 --> 00:13:27,221
But you don't know what
she's been upset about?

233
00:13:27,323 --> 00:13:29,507
Not really any of my business.

234
00:13:32,095 --> 00:13:34,796
- Yeah... What's next?
- Next, I finish up here

235
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:37,531
while you go find out
what's up with Lexie.

236
00:13:38,768 --> 00:13:40,618
- I'm sorry?
- She's upset.

237
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,565
And you're gonna find out why. You
want to be on my service? Then serve.

238
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:45,539
- Use that Avery sparkle.
- Dr. Sloan...

239
00:13:45,642 --> 00:13:49,143
I'm gonna do a couple more rhinoplasties
this afternoon. You do me this solid,

240
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:52,679
and I just might be persuaded
to let you take the lead on one.

241
00:13:56,519 --> 00:13:58,185
OK.

242
00:14:05,895 --> 00:14:06,895
Oh.

243
00:14:06,996 --> 00:14:08,446
What're you doing?

244
00:14:08,548 --> 00:14:10,415
Uh...

245
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:13,067
I looked it up. And
those caffeine studies

246
00:14:13,169 --> 00:14:16,854
showed birth defects in
rats. And I'm not a rat, so...

247
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:18,417
- Tell her I'm not a rat.
- Let her have...

248
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:20,274
- We took a vote.
- Yeah, well,

249
00:14:20,376 --> 00:14:23,577
I have to fix multiple fractures,
Arizona. That's major surgery.

250
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:26,013
OK, so that totally changes
the situation completely.

251
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:29,800
And Mark's not here, so it's your
vote against mine... I need caffeine.

252
00:14:31,338 --> 00:14:35,556
OK. You want caffeine
that badly, Calliope, fine.

253
00:14:35,658 --> 00:14:39,610
You're a grownup. You can
make your own decisions.

254
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,896
That's right. So...

255
00:14:56,896 --> 00:15:00,581
Damn it! That is not
fair. You're not fair.

256
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:07,288
For someone who has a history of
ambivalence towards motherhood,

257
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:09,501
you got the whole
guilt thing down cold.

258
00:15:09,525 --> 00:15:10,975
I'm entitled to an opinion.

259
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:13,222
I've been left out of too much
of the conversation already.

260
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:15,686
And I sure as hell did not
choose Mark Sloan to be the father.

261
00:15:15,715 --> 00:15:19,884
So if I'm gonna do this, then, you
know what? I'm gonna have a voice.

262
00:15:22,005 --> 00:15:24,054
Oh, God, that's good.

263
00:15:26,876 --> 00:15:29,777
Holy crap! Your mom was smart.

264
00:15:29,879 --> 00:15:33,247
Truck. Cabin. Spoon.

265
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:34,715
Three for three!

266
00:15:34,817 --> 00:15:37,484
- Crap! This is so good!
- Is it better than this?

267
00:15:37,587 --> 00:15:41,089
'Cause seriously, Mer, you'd have
to have died of Alzheimer's to fail this.

268
00:15:41,191 --> 00:15:44,042
- I don't even know
if I'm doing it yet.
- You have to.

269
00:15:44,144 --> 00:15:46,327
"Mother/daughter
surgeons cure leading killer."

270
00:15:46,429 --> 00:15:48,829
I'm so jealous, and I'm doing
a heart transplant on a baby

271
00:15:48,931 --> 00:15:51,531
- that hasn't even
been born yet.
- Will you shut up about that?

272
00:15:52,802 --> 00:15:55,180
You're the one who needs to keep
his mouth shut, Cabbage Patch.

273
00:15:55,204 --> 00:16:00,908
Screw this. I've been on this case
for a month. I'm not just gonna sit here.

274
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:04,362
- Meredith, you
have to come see Dad.
- Does he want more organs?

275
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:07,799
He wouldn't say, he was too busy
lovin'-up on a tattooed 20-year-old.

276
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:11,169
Is that upsetting you?

277
00:16:11,271 --> 00:16:14,372
- You wanna talk about it?
- No!

278
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:19,443
No worries. I have
a surgery to get to.

279
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:22,179
- Meredith?
- I can't deal with my dad.

280
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:24,415
- I'm too busy with my mom.
- Let's go.

281
00:16:24,517 --> 00:16:27,485
I wanna see your dad making
out with his tatted up fiancée.

282
00:16:27,587 --> 00:16:31,672
- They're not engaged.
- Are you sure?

283
00:16:32,842 --> 00:16:36,426
- Meredith, please.
- Fine.

284
00:16:41,784 --> 00:16:43,918
You're doing great, Sarah.

285
00:16:46,522 --> 00:16:48,567
- I didn't hear her cry.
- Her lungs were junky.

286
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:50,552
- We had to intubate.
- She deteriorated fast.

287
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:52,955
- I'll call for an X-ray
and ultrasound.
- Already ordered it.

288
00:16:52,979 --> 00:16:55,446
What's her pH?
You'll need an ABG...

289
00:16:55,548 --> 00:16:59,250
- Karev, we got it.
- Dr. Robbins, she's my patient.

290
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:00,984
Not anymore.

291
00:17:07,409 --> 00:17:10,745
- You got something for me,
Avery?
- I do, actually.

292
00:17:10,847 --> 00:17:13,664
Her dad's here. He
might be rejecting his liver.

293
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:16,126
And he brought his
20-year-old girlfriend.

294
00:17:16,168 --> 00:17:20,087
Yeah, that'll do it. Lexie's
probably going crazy.

295
00:17:20,189 --> 00:17:23,841
Meredith's no help when
it comes to their father.

296
00:17:29,265 --> 00:17:31,532
I'm not gonna be lead
surgeon on a rhinoplasty, am I?

297
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:33,812
- She just needs someone
to talk to.
- We are not close.

298
00:17:33,836 --> 00:17:36,904
- That is not something we do.
- Peanut butter cups.

299
00:17:37,006 --> 00:17:38,484
- What?
- She's a stress eater.

300
00:17:38,508 --> 00:17:40,324
You get her eating,
you get her talking.

301
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:42,810
- She loves peanut butter cups.
- That's ridiculous.

302
00:17:42,912 --> 00:17:46,163
Tomorrow, I'm doing a
series of cleft-palate surgeries

303
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:48,415
for the Nightingales
Foundation. Pro bono.

304
00:17:48,518 --> 00:17:51,485
That sort of thing might
look fantastic on the resume

305
00:17:51,587 --> 00:17:54,338
of someone who's in the
running for chief resident.

306
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:59,443
- Might?
- Get some results... we'll talk.

307
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,754
- Get in there.
- And do what?

308
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:11,889
- Make it stop!
- There's no way she's 20.

309
00:18:11,991 --> 00:18:17,111
- She's gotta be, like, 26, 27.
- I'm 27.

310
00:18:18,147 --> 00:18:19,814
Oh.

311
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:21,377
Gross.

312
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:27,804
Tiny-baby-heart time. Careful
when you go in there, Mer.

313
00:18:27,906 --> 00:18:31,542
You tangle with one Hells Angel,
you tangle with the whole gang.

314
00:18:34,147 --> 00:18:37,731
- OK. You coming?
- I'm not going in there again.

315
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:39,783
- Seriously, Lexie?
- I can't.

316
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:41,725
- Well, then I'm going
back to work.
- Meredith!

317
00:18:47,643 --> 00:18:50,661
- All right, hey. Move, please.
- I'm gonna page Bailey.

318
00:18:50,763 --> 00:18:53,948
- This is what
happened last time.
- Dad, is it the same pain?

319
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:55,560
- Where does it hurt?
- I'm telling you,

320
00:18:55,584 --> 00:18:57,596
- I have seen this before.
- Will you please let him talk?

321
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:00,037
- He can't talk.
- It's here.

322
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,339
- All right, just back up.
- Baby, it's gonna be OK.

323
00:19:02,408 --> 00:19:05,626
- Back up.
- I need to do something. Tell me...

324
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:08,462
Back the hell up right now!

325
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,283
All right, all right, Dad.

326
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:22,126
The blood tests indicate
that your liver's fine.

327
00:19:22,228 --> 00:19:25,646
Is there anything at
all that you've left out?

328
00:19:26,699 --> 00:19:29,549
It's when he pees.
Just now. And then,

329
00:19:29,652 --> 00:19:33,137
last Thursday, we had Mexican
food, and he drank all this water

330
00:19:33,239 --> 00:19:37,425
because it was spicy and he went to
the bathroom as soon as we got home.

331
00:19:37,527 --> 00:19:40,027
I was so freaked out when he
screamed later during the sex,

332
00:19:40,129 --> 00:19:42,880
- I didn't even connect it.
- All right. Good, that helps.

333
00:19:42,982 --> 00:19:46,984
- So what do you
think it could be?
- It could be kidney stones.

334
00:19:47,086 --> 00:19:49,436
- Or your prostate.
- Prostate? Are...?

335
00:19:49,538 --> 00:19:52,205
You're saying he could have
cancer. He can't have cancer.

336
00:19:52,307 --> 00:19:54,547
That's what happens when
your boyfriend's an old man.

337
00:19:54,577 --> 00:19:56,217
- Old men get cancer.
- Lexie...

338
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:58,038
But see, if you were
a doctor, like we are,

339
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:59,908
you'd realize that when
we use the word "prostate",

340
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:02,193
- it doesn't necessarily
mean cancer.
- Dr. Grey.

341
00:20:02,217 --> 00:20:05,570
No, see, freaking out and jumping
to conclusions like a little child

342
00:20:05,672 --> 00:20:08,789
- isn't gonna do him any good.
- I am scared, OK?!

343
00:20:08,891 --> 00:20:11,992
I am terrified over here,
and I've got questions.

344
00:20:12,094 --> 00:20:14,278
You're terrified?
We're his family.

345
00:20:14,363 --> 00:20:16,647
- I'm his family, too!
- No, you're not his family!

346
00:20:16,749 --> 00:20:19,900
- You're his midlife crisis!
- Lexie, Lexie!

347
00:20:20,002 --> 00:20:21,902
That's enough.
You're out of line.

348
00:20:23,473 --> 00:20:26,173
- Fine.
- Lexie.

349
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:31,411
Cancer is one of a
hundred things it could be.

350
00:20:31,514 --> 00:20:33,608
Dr. Bailey will run some
more tests just to rule it out.

351
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:37,117
It's far more likely there's
another explanation for this.

352
00:20:37,219 --> 00:20:38,530
Are you the daughter
that gave him the liver?

353
00:20:38,554 --> 00:20:41,989
- I am.
- Thank you.

354
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:53,651
- Say it again for the camera.
- No, no I don't think I will.

355
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:55,347
Kepner, talk to the camera
so we can get to the OR.

356
00:20:55,371 --> 00:20:58,555
In my normal voice, or...?

357
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,093
Randy has multiple fractures.

358
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:05,862
The most pressing problems
are his hip dislocations.

359
00:21:05,964 --> 00:21:09,800
So we are going to reduce
them as soon as possible

360
00:21:09,902 --> 00:21:11,530
- before they lose blood flow.
- Reduce?

361
00:21:11,554 --> 00:21:14,955
- Pop 'em back into place.
- Oh, man!

362
00:21:15,057 --> 00:21:18,926
Hold on, let me get up on
this chair for the wide angle.

363
00:21:19,028 --> 00:21:20,310
Yeah. We're not doing it here.

364
00:21:20,412 --> 00:21:22,479
He has to be sedated and
we have to fix his femur.

365
00:21:22,581 --> 00:21:24,648
So we're just gonna
do everything in the OR.

366
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:27,034
What if we did the hips
here, while I'm awake?

367
00:21:27,136 --> 00:21:28,713
And I can give the
thumbs-up to the camera.

368
00:21:28,737 --> 00:21:31,538
You're really not grasping
how much this'll hurt.

369
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:36,643
- It's for the art, Dr. Torres.
- You know what?

370
00:21:37,613 --> 00:21:39,446
That is a great idea.

371
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:44,669
- Dr. Hunt, I think that it's...
- Dr. Torres, it is for the art.

372
00:21:45,972 --> 00:21:47,955
Oh.

373
00:21:48,057 --> 00:21:51,342
OK. OK. OK, yeah.

374
00:21:51,444 --> 00:21:55,679
Marcus, hop on that chair.
Kepner, spot him. All right. Sure.

375
00:21:56,482 --> 00:21:59,350
OK, you guys ready?

376
00:21:59,452 --> 00:22:01,152
OK.

377
00:22:02,337 --> 00:22:04,071
Please stop! Stop!

378
00:22:04,173 --> 00:22:07,674
Stop! Turn the camera off!
Stop! Turn the camera off!

379
00:22:07,776 --> 00:22:09,693
Marcus, turn the camera off!

380
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:14,482
- That totally cheered me up.
- Art has that effect.

381
00:22:25,711 --> 00:22:28,896
Listen, I'm sorry
about the turnip thing.

382
00:22:28,998 --> 00:22:32,483
I shouldn't have said
it. But doctor to doctor,

383
00:22:32,585 --> 00:22:35,653
you over-reacted.
That's my patient.

384
00:22:35,754 --> 00:22:37,387
I deserve to be in there.

385
00:22:39,708 --> 00:22:42,642
You deserve it? Huh.

386
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:45,962
You know, I have a patient, too.

387
00:22:46,065 --> 00:22:47,931
You wanna know what
happened to my patient?

388
00:22:48,017 --> 00:22:50,328
- Look, I'm sure it's tough...
- She had a 40-hour labor.

389
00:22:50,352 --> 00:22:54,554
And then the baby was stuck
on an angle, wouldn't drop.

390
00:22:54,656 --> 00:22:58,308
So my patient just had to push

391
00:22:58,411 --> 00:23:01,145
and push and push.

392
00:23:01,247 --> 00:23:05,683
And you want to know what you say
to a woman who's in that kind of pain?

393
00:23:05,784 --> 00:23:07,834
You say, "One more, Jackie.

394
00:23:07,936 --> 00:23:11,571
One more and you're
gonna see that baby.

395
00:23:11,674 --> 00:23:15,876
One more and you're gonna
have a beautiful baby boy.

396
00:23:15,978 --> 00:23:20,313
I know it hurts, I know it does,
but give me one more, Jackie,

397
00:23:20,415 --> 00:23:23,250
and you get a baby".

398
00:23:23,352 --> 00:23:27,504
That's how you get a woman
to tear her own body apart.

399
00:23:28,307 --> 00:23:31,575
You promise her a baby.

400
00:23:31,677 --> 00:23:36,063
You make a promise and she
hurts herself because she trusts you,

401
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:42,670
and then when the baby
comes out and he's not...

402
00:23:43,772 --> 00:23:45,706
he's not...

403
00:23:47,042 --> 00:23:49,876
You're the one that's
gotta tell her that you were...

404
00:23:50,479 --> 00:23:51,996
mistaken.

405
00:23:53,749 --> 00:23:59,169
Makes me kind of lose
interest in what you deserve,

406
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:02,272
Mr. Where's The Cabbage Patch.

407
00:24:16,122 --> 00:24:19,857
Hey, Dad's got a kidney stone.
Dr. Bailey's taking him up to the OR now.

408
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:22,337
Well, she didn't just give him
a strainer? It's gotta be huge.

409
00:24:22,361 --> 00:24:23,727
Well, he deserves it.

410
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:26,197
I never really got it before,
but this is how he operates.

411
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:28,376
He starts up new families,
stops talking to the old ones.

412
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,400
He'll go off and marry
Dani, The Tattooed Lady,

413
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:33,348
have six little mid-life crisis babies,
and I'll never hear from him again.

414
00:24:33,372 --> 00:24:35,573
It's exactly what he did to you.

415
00:24:35,675 --> 00:24:37,119
It is not exactly
what he did to me.

416
00:24:37,143 --> 00:24:39,438
- Of course it is.
- Lexie, my mother
had an affair,

417
00:24:39,462 --> 00:24:41,773
and then took his
kid across the country.

418
00:24:41,797 --> 00:24:43,992
Your mother died
and he was miserable.

419
00:24:44,016 --> 00:24:46,361
And he started drinking
and he destroyed his liver.

420
00:24:46,385 --> 00:24:50,487
This isn't about you. He found
someone who makes him happy.

421
00:24:50,589 --> 00:24:53,723
Just give him your
blessing. Let him be happy.

422
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:56,627
What're you talking
about? Don't defend him.

423
00:24:56,729 --> 00:25:00,714
- You hate him! Hate him with me!
- Lexie, I love you,

424
00:25:00,816 --> 00:25:02,983
but you have to grow up.

425
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:14,617
We've got a strong heartbeat.
I think she likes her new heart.

426
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,747
Of course she
does. It's delightful.

427
00:25:16,832 --> 00:25:19,466
All right. Let's take off
the clamp, Dr. Yang.

428
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:26,440
Why is her blood
pressure so low?

429
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:28,626
There's a low arterial
pressure wave.

430
00:25:28,728 --> 00:25:33,063
All right, let's check it. Maybe
there's a kink in the art line somewhere.

431
00:25:33,165 --> 00:25:36,299
Damn it! Turn up the flow.

432
00:25:36,402 --> 00:25:39,319
That aorta needs a long
diagonal anastomosis.

433
00:25:39,421 --> 00:25:41,182
- That'll take at least
45 minutes.
- We don't have that.

434
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:43,991
We've gotta do it in 30, otherwise
we're gonna lose her. Scalpel!

435
00:25:44,093 --> 00:25:46,459
Clamp it. Start the clock.

436
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:51,448
Son of a bitch.

437
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:57,871
I hate this. I hate this.

438
00:25:57,973 --> 00:26:00,707
Come on... Come on...

439
00:26:02,077 --> 00:26:04,528
- What time do you have, Yang?
- Twenty-seven minutes.

440
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:07,247
OK, I'm ready.

441
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:09,699
Clamp off.

442
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:13,169
We got this.

443
00:26:13,272 --> 00:26:15,189
Robbins, Altman, they got this.

444
00:26:15,291 --> 00:26:18,075
Yeah? Then why do you look sick?

445
00:26:28,237 --> 00:26:31,721
- Pressure wave's coming back.
- Systolic's 57.

446
00:26:32,941 --> 00:26:34,124
Sixty.

447
00:26:35,811 --> 00:26:38,778
Sixty-four.

448
00:26:38,881 --> 00:26:40,780
- Eighty-two.
- That's it! Yes!

449
00:26:40,883 --> 00:26:43,199
- Yes!
- Yes!

450
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,497
Chief, I'm with a patient.

451
00:26:57,599 --> 00:26:59,411
Did you get a chance to
look over the materials?

452
00:26:59,435 --> 00:27:02,275
- I did. It's amazing.
- The next step is getting
the funding

453
00:27:02,338 --> 00:27:06,957
in place, and I can make two phone
calls and have that by midweek.

454
00:27:07,059 --> 00:27:11,695
- So you're waiting for...
- You.

455
00:27:11,797 --> 00:27:15,315
You have to sign on as co-investigator
so we can start moving forward.

456
00:27:15,417 --> 00:27:18,952
- Chief, it's an amazing offer.
- It's not an offer, Meredith.

457
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:21,822
I can't offer something
that doesn't belong to me.

458
00:27:21,924 --> 00:27:25,592
It was your mother's work, and
it's only right that you continue it.

459
00:27:28,496 --> 00:27:33,167
- So you think that I
owe it to her?
- Honestly?

460
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:36,803
I think she owes it to you.

461
00:27:36,922 --> 00:27:40,574
She didn't give you a lot of
love, but she gave you her talent.

462
00:27:40,675 --> 00:27:43,009
And her name.

463
00:27:43,111 --> 00:27:45,011
And this.

464
00:27:45,113 --> 00:27:48,131
This gift could change
the course of your career.

465
00:27:49,534 --> 00:27:53,820
- I have to get back inside.
- Meredith.

466
00:27:56,875 --> 00:28:00,877
It might change the
way you think about her.

467
00:28:00,979 --> 00:28:03,880
It could be the greatest
thing the both of you ever did.

468
00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:17,844
How did it get to this? How
did four seconds of Internet fame

469
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:20,106
become worth breaking
yourself into a million pieces?

470
00:28:20,148 --> 00:28:23,083
He did it... because
he thinks it's funny.

471
00:28:23,185 --> 00:28:25,580
That's bull. You just don't
put yourself at that kind of risk.

472
00:28:25,604 --> 00:28:28,388
- Well, it's his decision.
- His decision?

473
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:30,401
Idiots like this shouldn't
be allowed to make any...

474
00:28:30,425 --> 00:28:34,194
It is his body, OK! And you don't get
to say what he can and can't do with it!

475
00:28:34,312 --> 00:28:37,681
He is a person, he gets to
make his own damn choices!

476
00:28:37,783 --> 00:28:40,450
I am going through the worst
caffeine withdrawal of my life

477
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:42,363
because someone thinks
that being pregnant means

478
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:44,883
- I'm no longer of sound
frickin' mind!
- You're pregnant?

479
00:28:44,907 --> 00:28:50,593
Shut up! I'm not endangering my
baby. I just want one damn cup of coffee!

480
00:28:50,679 --> 00:28:53,680
OK. Kepner, go get
Dr. Torres a cup of coffee.

481
00:28:53,782 --> 00:28:56,032
- OK.
- Run!

482
00:28:59,288 --> 00:29:01,821
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.

483
00:29:01,923 --> 00:29:04,558
Whatever. Just come around
here and help me with this hip!

484
00:29:07,313 --> 00:29:09,779
Ready, one, two, three.

485
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:22,642
She doesn't seem so bad.

486
00:29:24,964 --> 00:29:27,164
Candy?

487
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:30,083
Screw you and your candy.

488
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:33,536
- She's terrible.
- All right.

489
00:29:34,923 --> 00:29:37,007
Ever notice how
my sister's a jerk?

490
00:29:37,092 --> 00:29:38,825
- I...
- "Give him your blessing."

491
00:29:38,927 --> 00:29:43,547
What a bunch of crap. Let
him be happy? What about me?

492
00:29:43,649 --> 00:29:46,617
You know, everybody's
making these huge life decisions,

493
00:29:46,719 --> 00:29:50,553
and they're not even considering
how it'll affect me. How I'll feel.

494
00:29:50,655 --> 00:29:54,858
You know, I'm supposed to
be such a big part of their lives,

495
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,400
and yet they're leaving me out
of the conversation completely.

496
00:29:57,429 --> 00:30:02,683
Starting up new families and springing
it on me when it's already a done deal.

497
00:30:02,784 --> 00:30:05,285
"Hey, Lexie, guess what?

498
00:30:05,387 --> 00:30:08,455
I found a tatted up skank to be
your new mommy. "" Hey, Lexie,

499
00:30:08,557 --> 00:30:11,875
I'm gonna have a baby and you're
just gonna have to be OK with that!"

500
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:13,855
Wait a second. Your
dad's having a baby?

501
00:30:13,879 --> 00:30:17,014
No, not my dad. Mark.

502
00:30:22,922 --> 00:30:28,091
Mark is having a baby, and
he didn't even ask my opinion.

503
00:30:28,176 --> 00:30:30,961
He just clobbered
me with it. Again.

504
00:30:31,063 --> 00:30:35,765
And he's leaving
me behind... again.

505
00:30:38,404 --> 00:30:42,689
So we're done, you
know? We have to be.

506
00:30:42,791 --> 00:30:44,857
But I miss him.

507
00:30:49,048 --> 00:30:50,981
Crap.

508
00:30:52,617 --> 00:30:55,685
My dad's tatted up
skank isn't the bitch.

509
00:30:56,638 --> 00:30:58,371
I am.

510
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:07,564
Probably a good start would be to
stop calling her a tatted up skank.

511
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:10,483
Right.

512
00:31:13,255 --> 00:31:15,122
Thanks.

513
00:31:16,257 --> 00:31:18,191
For listening.

514
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:21,912
Anytime.

515
00:31:44,453 --> 00:31:45,652
Hey.

516
00:31:45,754 --> 00:31:48,905
I banned him from
the NICU this morning.

517
00:31:49,007 --> 00:31:50,990
Kinda want to go in
there and kick him out.

518
00:31:51,092 --> 00:31:54,894
Yeah, punishing Karev is one
of my favorite pastimes, too.

519
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:57,230
He's harsh sometimes.
But he's also the guy

520
00:31:57,332 --> 00:31:59,143
that gets thrown off a case
and then sits in the gallery

521
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:02,668
and watches an entire surgery
just to make sure his patient's OK.

522
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:08,107
I'll teach him to be less of an ass, but
I don't have to teach him how to care.

523
00:32:12,064 --> 00:32:15,966
Do you even have the authority
to ban someone from the NICU?

524
00:32:16,068 --> 00:32:18,234
I don't know.

525
00:32:28,781 --> 00:32:31,714
Just in time, Avery.
Scrub in and take the lead.

526
00:32:31,817 --> 00:32:34,751
That's OK. I just came by to
tell you that you were wrong.

527
00:32:34,853 --> 00:32:37,320
Those peanut butter
cups got me nowhere.

528
00:32:37,422 --> 00:32:39,639
- You're kidding.
- Guess you overestimated

529
00:32:39,741 --> 00:32:41,641
that Avery sparkle, huh?

530
00:32:44,096 --> 00:32:47,547
- Where are you going? Scrub in.
- Really?

531
00:32:47,649 --> 00:32:52,202
- I... I assumed
no results, no surgery.
- I'm not a total bastard.

532
00:32:52,304 --> 00:32:55,105
You gave it your
best shot. Scrub in.

533
00:32:57,442 --> 00:32:59,409
OK.

534
00:33:04,182 --> 00:33:07,817
- I don't know.
- It's OK. Take your time.

535
00:33:10,355 --> 00:33:12,322
Truck.

536
00:33:14,976 --> 00:33:16,776
Cabin.

537
00:33:21,183 --> 00:33:24,367
Remember the third word, Mom?

538
00:33:29,607 --> 00:33:31,741
We should have come earlier.

539
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:35,027
- She has a harder time
in the evenings.
- She's doing fine.

540
00:33:35,129 --> 00:33:37,280
We're just running some tests.

541
00:33:39,567 --> 00:33:44,004
It's "spoon", Mom.
Remember, "spoon"?

542
00:33:45,174 --> 00:33:47,523
I don't know why we're here.

543
00:33:50,045 --> 00:33:51,778
Why are we here?

544
00:33:53,816 --> 00:33:58,485
- It's such a little word.
- Can we go home now?

545
00:33:59,187 --> 00:34:01,671
OK, Mom. OK.

546
00:34:17,706 --> 00:34:19,255
He's gonna be sore for a while.

547
00:34:19,357 --> 00:34:22,676
You'll need to make sure
he drinks plenty of water.

548
00:34:25,113 --> 00:34:28,214
- Dr. Grey?
- Is he OK?

549
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:30,116
He's fine.

550
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,703
Lexie?

551
00:34:43,866 --> 00:34:46,666
Will you please just make
sure that he calls me?

552
00:34:47,536 --> 00:34:50,770
- Yes. Of course.
- Thank you.

553
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,934
I'm almost five years sober.

554
00:35:05,971 --> 00:35:08,638
We support each other and...

555
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:10,723
I'm good for him.

556
00:35:11,844 --> 00:35:15,612
And he is really,
really good for me.

557
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,336
That a hooker on your shoulder?

558
00:35:24,773 --> 00:35:26,472
I was drunk.

559
00:35:27,442 --> 00:35:29,325
OK.

560
00:35:30,879 --> 00:35:34,548
There he is. How
you feelin', buddy?

561
00:35:36,852 --> 00:35:40,504
I can't straighten it
out any more than that.

562
00:35:40,606 --> 00:35:43,139
There's the surgeon! You're
the man, Dr. Hunt! How'd he do?

563
00:35:43,241 --> 00:35:46,309
OK, Randy. Since there was
a tear in your joint capsule,

564
00:35:46,411 --> 00:35:50,179
we needed to open up the hip to
reduce it. We put a rod and screws in

565
00:35:50,281 --> 00:35:53,850
to the other femur to fix
that and reduce the other hip.

566
00:35:53,952 --> 00:35:57,737
And this piece of hardware is
keeping your wrist fracture together.

567
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:02,108
That's intense. Is that, like,
some sort of record or something?

568
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:04,343
Like the worst case
you've ever seen?

569
00:36:04,445 --> 00:36:07,847
No. No, the worst
case I ever saw

570
00:36:07,949 --> 00:36:10,116
was a guy who had an ex
fix on his arm like this one,

571
00:36:10,218 --> 00:36:14,037
but he also had a gaping hole with
exposed bone that needed to be covered.

572
00:36:14,139 --> 00:36:18,575
He also had a matching hole
that ripped through his back

573
00:36:18,677 --> 00:36:23,696
and tore his stomach apart. We did 11
surgeries to reconstruct his abdomen.

574
00:36:23,799 --> 00:36:28,067
- He survived all that?
- No. No, he didn't.

575
00:36:28,169 --> 00:36:32,388
But you know, come to think of it,
your situation, it is actually worse.

576
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:35,592
- How?
- That guy, he threw himself

577
00:36:35,694 --> 00:36:39,596
in front of a grenade to
save six other soldiers.

578
00:36:39,698 --> 00:36:44,150
He didn't launch himself into a brick
wall so the Internet could laugh at him.

579
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:54,411
Turn the camera off, Marcus.

580
00:37:13,464 --> 00:37:15,748
Chief.

581
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:19,486
I'd forgotten this about your
mother. She wrote everything down.

582
00:37:19,588 --> 00:37:22,238
She didn't have a thought
or a fragment of a thought

583
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:26,075
that didn't get scribbled in some
journal. She was compulsive.

584
00:37:26,177 --> 00:37:29,496
- Lucky for you that she did.
- Lucky for both of us.

585
00:37:29,598 --> 00:37:32,264
No, for you.

586
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:40,306
You knew the woman who wrote
them. That's why I gave them to you.

587
00:37:40,408 --> 00:37:43,176
I was happy to read them
and to understand her better,

588
00:37:43,278 --> 00:37:45,979
but the woman I
knew was different.

589
00:37:46,081 --> 00:37:50,783
But I am starting to realize
how scared she must have been.

590
00:37:50,885 --> 00:37:54,654
That had to be why she
was writing everything down.

591
00:37:54,756 --> 00:37:58,892
- She must have been so scared.
- Meredith...

592
00:37:58,994 --> 00:38:01,528
So, please, go ahead.

593
00:38:01,629 --> 00:38:04,664
I think it's right that
you continue her work.

594
00:38:04,766 --> 00:38:08,201
But I really just want
to cure her disease.

595
00:38:12,073 --> 00:38:14,240
Good night, chief.

596
00:38:17,829 --> 00:38:19,762
Good night.

597
00:38:26,471 --> 00:38:29,389
So, what's your plan?

598
00:38:30,608 --> 00:38:32,575
Sleep.

599
00:38:33,528 --> 00:38:37,330
My plan for tonight is sleep.

600
00:38:37,432 --> 00:38:40,233
I was gonna hit Joe's
before heading home.

601
00:38:40,335 --> 00:38:43,486
- Want to come?
- I just need to crash.

602
00:38:43,588 --> 00:38:46,505
Yeah. No, I get that.

603
00:38:50,095 --> 00:38:51,961
Maybe tomorrow?

604
00:38:53,815 --> 00:38:55,748
For sure, yeah.

605
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:34,553
- Sorry about your patient.
- Thanks. I'm happy for yours.

606
00:39:40,195 --> 00:39:41,628
- Hey, you want to get a...?
- No.

607
00:39:41,729 --> 00:39:43,363
Right.

608
00:39:53,257 --> 00:39:58,344
- We made dinner... for you!
- What is it?

609
00:39:58,446 --> 00:40:03,950
Grilled chicken breast and
some brown rice and broccoli.

610
00:40:04,052 --> 00:40:08,921
- And... Is that coffee?
- Yes.

611
00:40:09,023 --> 00:40:11,006
It is. And here's the thing.

612
00:40:11,109 --> 00:40:12,336
I get that things are
gonna be different now.

613
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:15,778
And that's why I'm
gonna eat that chicken,

614
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:19,026
even though the only thing I want
right now is a peanut butter sandwich.

615
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:21,167
- Great...
- Oh, I'm not done.

616
00:40:21,269 --> 00:40:24,136
If we're gonna do this whole
"everybody gets a vote" thing,

617
00:40:24,238 --> 00:40:28,191
there's gonna be a new system.
We'll still each get one vote.

618
00:40:28,293 --> 00:40:30,960
But, also, the baby gets a vote.

619
00:40:31,062 --> 00:40:34,814
As I house the baby, I'll be
speaking for him-slash-her.

620
00:40:34,916 --> 00:40:38,735
And since I'll be pushing this baby
out of a very small hole in my body,

621
00:40:38,837 --> 00:40:40,882
I'll also get an
extra-special vagina vote.

622
00:40:40,906 --> 00:40:44,840
So, that's three votes for
us, two votes for you guys.

623
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:47,977
Oh, we get the final say.
Now, I'll be using my many votes

624
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:51,814
to say that, once a day, I will
have one cup of regular coffee.

625
00:40:51,916 --> 00:40:54,728
Which is perfectly fine according
to the studies that I've read.

626
00:40:54,752 --> 00:40:57,381
At least until I begin breast-feeding.
Now, anybody want to argue

627
00:40:57,405 --> 00:40:59,066
with my extra-special
vagina vote?

628
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:00,756
- No.
- No, thank you.

629
00:41:00,858 --> 00:41:02,758
Great.

630
00:41:06,163 --> 00:41:08,865
Oh, we also vote that
Mark gives me a foot rub.

631
00:41:10,151 --> 00:41:12,435
I'll go get the lotion.

632
00:41:14,923 --> 00:41:18,524
OK, well, I guess that a peanut
butter sandwich is doable,

633
00:41:18,627 --> 00:41:22,512
- if you eat the broccoli.
- Deal.

634
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:38,328
<i>Surgery is a high-stakes game.</i>

635
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:40,496
Did you decide?

636
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:44,099
I did.

637
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:49,121
- I choose you.
- I'm glad.

638
00:41:49,223 --> 00:41:51,102
I've been going over the
data you collected today.

639
00:41:51,126 --> 00:41:55,094
And so far, it is 100 percent
consistent with the pre-trial phase.

640
00:41:56,947 --> 00:42:00,433
- Which means what?
- It means that it's not
not-working.

641
00:42:00,535 --> 00:42:02,351
Oh, that's great news.

642
00:42:03,321 --> 00:42:04,966
You wanna know what
else is great news?

643
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:06,200
- What?
- The kids aren't gonna be home

644
00:42:06,224 --> 00:42:07,556
for another 20 minutes.

645
00:42:07,658 --> 00:42:10,242
<i>But no matter how high
the stakes, sooner or later</i>

646
00:42:10,345 --> 00:42:12,962
<i>you're just gonna
have to go with your gut.</i>

647
00:42:13,064 --> 00:42:14,964
<i>And maybe, just maybe,</i>

648
00:42:15,066 --> 00:42:19,769
<i>that'll take you right where you
were meant to be in the first place.</i>
