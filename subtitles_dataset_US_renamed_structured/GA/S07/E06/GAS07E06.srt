1
00:00:02,569 --> 00:00:05,331
<i>Incoming, car versus motorcycle.</i>

2
00:00:05,355 --> 00:00:07,395
<i>Car jumped the rails,
hit the cyclist head on.</i>

3
00:00:07,425 --> 00:00:09,841
<i>37 year-old male,
unconscious and unresponsive</i>

4
00:00:09,943 --> 00:00:12,344
<i>with an idioventricular
rhythm. Obvious head trauma,</i>

5
00:00:12,446 --> 00:00:14,613
<i>brain matter evident on
the scene, 15 minutes out.</i>

6
00:00:14,715 --> 00:00:17,983
You heard 'em. Somebody
page Shepherd. Let's move!

7
00:00:18,085 --> 00:00:19,952
- Got it.
- We're on trauma rotation.

8
00:00:20,054 --> 00:00:22,232
So it's our job to
take point and assess

9
00:00:22,256 --> 00:00:23,967
each medical
emergency as it comes in.

10
00:00:23,991 --> 00:00:27,576
- Let's get X-ray in here!
- - Retractor.

11
00:00:27,678 --> 00:00:30,398
- Talk to me, Grey.
- Peripheral IV's blown,

12
00:00:30,481 --> 00:00:32,759
- pressure's plummeting.
- - <i>Running a code can be chaotic.</i>

13
00:00:32,783 --> 00:00:37,051
<i>Sometimes the best thing you can
do is know when to get out of the way.</i>

14
00:00:37,153 --> 00:00:39,905
- Someone page
Dr. Shepherd!
- V-tach!

15
00:00:40,007 --> 00:00:44,876
- No pulse. Push one of epi.
- Starting compressions!

16
00:00:44,978 --> 00:00:48,764
- Give me those paddles!
- Are wide open.

17
00:00:48,865 --> 00:00:53,585
I was paged down to assess
the patient's head trauma.

18
00:00:53,687 --> 00:00:56,020
When they stabilize him,
I'll go in, I'll do my stuff.

19
00:00:56,123 --> 00:00:59,157
- Let's see what we have.
- Got a rhythm.

20
00:01:03,463 --> 00:01:05,814
That's it. He's
basically brain dead.

21
00:01:05,916 --> 00:01:08,383
Um, excuse me one second.

22
00:01:14,341 --> 00:01:15,769
We're still gonna have
to cross match him.

23
00:01:15,793 --> 00:01:17,759
- Yeah, of course.
- Hey.

24
00:01:17,862 --> 00:01:19,940
Hey, look at this.
Blood type's a match,

25
00:01:19,964 --> 00:01:24,265
skin's a match. Age,
size, gender, all matching.

26
00:01:24,368 --> 00:01:27,569
- We got our guy.
- We got our guy?

27
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:29,638
We got our guy.

28
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:31,217
You picked a good
night to start filming.

29
00:01:31,241 --> 00:01:33,659
- Yeah.
- This is gonna be fun.

30
00:01:33,761 --> 00:01:35,922
We just got a call from
Dr. Sloan. He said to hurry over,

31
00:01:35,946 --> 00:01:39,197
- so we got out of bed and came in.
- - Right in.

32
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:44,035
I was in such a hurry, I forgot my
shoes. Look, I still got my slippers on.

33
00:01:44,138 --> 00:01:46,972
Ha! We've been waiting
for this for so long.

34
00:01:47,074 --> 00:01:49,741
Today's the day. Today
is my transplant day.

35
00:01:49,843 --> 00:01:54,545
- Yay, Transplant Day!
- I'm gonna get me some arms.

36
00:01:56,166 --> 00:01:58,633
<i>Seattle Grace
Mercy West Hospital.</i>

37
00:01:58,735 --> 00:02:02,337
<i>Home to some of the finest, most
influential doctors in the country.</i>

38
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:04,990
<i>Several months ago, a
gunman roamed these halls,</i>

39
00:02:05,092 --> 00:02:07,442
<i>leaving 11 people dead
and even more injured.</i>

40
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:10,662
<i>Today, we visit the survivors,
their patients, their triumphs</i>

41
00:02:10,764 --> 00:02:16,901
<i>and their disappointments. This is</i>
Seattle Medical: Road to Recovery.

42
00:02:18,405 --> 00:02:20,905
<i>Things have changed
since the shooting, sure.</i>

43
00:02:21,007 --> 00:02:25,493
For one thing, over the last
month, we have installed a number

44
00:02:25,596 --> 00:02:28,380
of new, uh, security measures.

45
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:31,683
We're trying to make
it safer for the hospital,

46
00:02:31,785 --> 00:02:34,319
the doctors and the patients.

47
00:02:34,421 --> 00:02:36,221
- Come on!
- So, what...

48
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:37,900
We go through this every
morning. It's me. I swear.

49
00:02:37,924 --> 00:02:41,176
I just... I have a different hair
color, that's all. It's... Chief!

50
00:02:41,278 --> 00:02:45,714
Chief, would you please... Would
you come tell them that I'm me? Please?

51
00:02:45,815 --> 00:02:47,382
Um...

52
00:02:47,484 --> 00:02:51,519
- Excuse me. What's going on?
- I just... Every day.

53
00:02:51,622 --> 00:02:54,472
Uh, we are fourth-year
surgical residents.

54
00:02:54,575 --> 00:02:57,559
And, uh, we're
friends. Good friends.

55
00:02:57,661 --> 00:03:03,548
It's pretty impossible to work this
closely and not become good friends.

56
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:06,901
Can we call Respiratory
to get a vent down here?

57
00:03:07,003 --> 00:03:09,688
He's tachycardic
and hypotensive.

58
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:13,592
Decreased breath sounds on
the left. Let's get a chest tube.

59
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:15,774
- His blood pressure's dropping.
- Let's make sure...

60
00:03:15,813 --> 00:03:19,714
<i>Sure, going through something
like that, it's brought us closer.</i>

61
00:03:19,816 --> 00:03:21,583
Not that we
weren't close before.

62
00:03:21,685 --> 00:03:24,286
I mean, ask anyone. We're close.

63
00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:27,088
Dr. Yang and my wife
sometimes have sleepovers.

64
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:29,391
In my bed, with me in it.

65
00:03:29,493 --> 00:03:32,377
<i>So, yeah. Yes. It's
brought us closer for sure.</i>

66
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:35,229
- He needs a thoracotomy.
- Right, right.

67
00:03:35,332 --> 00:03:37,165
- Yes, please.
- I'll work the OR.

68
00:03:37,267 --> 00:03:38,850
Where's that ABG?

69
00:03:41,872 --> 00:03:43,238
Sterile drape.

70
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:46,508
- Here. Take over
compressions. Great.
- I'll get it.

71
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:51,112
<i>It's, uh, 7am. I've
been here two hours.</i>

72
00:03:51,214 --> 00:03:54,066
My interns, they
got here before that.

73
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:58,570
They check on the patients and report
to me before I check on the patients,

74
00:03:58,672 --> 00:04:01,433
report to my attending.
Lily! I told you already.

75
00:04:01,475 --> 00:04:05,844
Turn it down or put in the headphones.
The rest of us don't have Bieber fever.

76
00:04:05,946 --> 00:04:09,681
Whatever that is.

77
00:04:09,783 --> 00:04:12,551
How have I changed
since the shooting?

78
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:15,053
Um...

79
00:04:15,155 --> 00:04:17,822
I don't know.

80
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:19,924
Oh, I got this.

81
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:29,801
Today, I'm going back to Seattle
Grace for my colostomy reversal.

82
00:04:29,903 --> 00:04:33,204
Oh. Babe, did we remember
my robe and my fuzzy socks?

83
00:04:33,307 --> 00:04:37,442
Yes and yes. If by
"we," you mean me.

84
00:04:37,544 --> 00:04:39,411
Because you forgot.

85
00:04:39,513 --> 00:04:43,047
<i>I was supposed to get
this surgery months ago but,</i>

86
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:46,968
well, the shooting
happened instead.

87
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:50,588
- You have the parking ticket?
- Yeah, in my pocket.

88
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:57,829
<i>I haven't been back to
the hospital since that day.</i>

89
00:04:57,931 --> 00:05:01,116
<i>I don't know how it
will feel to be back.</i>

90
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:05,186
<i>That's right, it's
Portman. P-O-R-T-M-A-N.</i>

91
00:05:05,306 --> 00:05:07,773
And can you tell me where
I can get this validated?

92
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:09,475
- I'll take care of it.
- Thanks.

93
00:05:13,681 --> 00:05:16,080
Hey, Dr. B.

94
00:05:16,183 --> 00:05:18,216
Oh!

95
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:23,188
Yeah, I don't generally make
it a habit to hug my patients.

96
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:26,041
<i>Yeah, well, when you get
paged 911, you don't walk.</i>

97
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:28,126
<i>You never walk.</i>

98
00:05:29,196 --> 00:05:31,029
OK, talk.

99
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:36,201
OK.

100
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:48,012
God, I can't get past the
obstruction. Damn it. How long?

101
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:49,754
- Five minutes.
- Damn it!

102
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:53,452
Yes. Yes, do it now.

103
00:06:13,173 --> 00:06:15,613
No, no, no. Lily, Lily, I
know, I know this is scary.

104
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:18,609
You stopped breathing. And
so we had to take you to the OR

105
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:21,279
and put a tube in your neck
to help get you air. No, no.

106
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:24,983
You can't talk, OK? But we called
your mom at work, and she's on her way.

107
00:06:25,085 --> 00:06:27,836
Lily was admitted with
respiratory distress last night.

108
00:06:27,938 --> 00:06:30,238
She has a growth
on her windpipe.

109
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:32,724
It's benign, except for
there's nothing benign

110
00:06:32,826 --> 00:06:34,237
about something that's
blocking your airway.

111
00:06:34,261 --> 00:06:36,138
She's had surgeries
to remove it in the past,

112
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:37,740
but it's aggressive.
It keeps recurring,

113
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:40,581
and, obviously,
it's gotten worse.

114
00:06:40,684 --> 00:06:43,195
- Much worse.
- - This is the nurse's button.

115
00:06:43,219 --> 00:06:45,770
If you need anything, you
push it. I mean, push it a lot.

116
00:06:45,872 --> 00:06:50,174
Don't worry about being annoying.
Push it till they come in here.

117
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:56,347
It's OK. It's all right. Here.

118
00:07:00,187 --> 00:07:01,986
Not too loud, OK?

119
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:05,524
<i>It happens more than you'd think,
having to do a procedure on a kid</i>

120
00:07:05,626 --> 00:07:08,794
<i>with no parents around. Some of
these kids are in here for weeks.</i>

121
00:07:08,896 --> 00:07:12,097
Their parents usually can't
take off that much work.

122
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:13,932
But, I mean, we try to help out.

123
00:07:14,034 --> 00:07:18,136
We have these beds, we call them
parent cots, for the parents to sleep in.

124
00:07:18,238 --> 00:07:20,639
But a lot of these kids
spend a lot of time alone.

125
00:07:20,741 --> 00:07:23,675
Just works out that way.
Doesn't mean they're bad parents,

126
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:27,145
they're just busy parents.

127
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:30,782
I found out last
night that he...

128
00:07:30,884 --> 00:07:34,102
had been in an accident.

129
00:07:36,306 --> 00:07:41,526
Just before the phone rang,
I had this sinking feeling.

130
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:43,761
Motorcycles.

131
00:07:45,032 --> 00:07:49,000
Donor cycles. Isn't
that what they call them?

132
00:07:49,102 --> 00:07:51,736
<i>They called me in here because
even though Sam is a donor,</i>

133
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:56,708
<i>they need special consent
for something like this.</i>

134
00:07:56,810 --> 00:08:01,095
I know Sam would want to donate
whatever he could so, of course, yes.

135
00:08:01,197 --> 00:08:04,549
They can... They
can take his arms.

136
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:08,269
Absolutely. I have
no problem with that.

137
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:16,728
Although... it's hard.

138
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:22,366
The thought of somebody
else... holding his hand.

139
00:08:24,938 --> 00:08:26,605
See that? That
could be a problem.

140
00:08:26,707 --> 00:08:29,541
What if we try a bypass instead?

141
00:08:30,611 --> 00:08:33,461
<i>Derek and I? We go way back.</i>

142
00:08:33,563 --> 00:08:36,931
<i>We grew up together, we
went to med school together.</i>

143
00:08:37,033 --> 00:08:40,885
He's... he's kinda
like my better half.

144
00:08:40,987 --> 00:08:44,188
Not the better-looking
half, mind you.

145
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:48,459
So when I heard he got shot...

146
00:08:54,434 --> 00:08:58,235
Every day we give
bad news to patients.

147
00:08:58,337 --> 00:09:01,739
We tell them their
loved ones are hurt,

148
00:09:01,841 --> 00:09:05,176
or dying, or dead.

149
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:13,150
And for the first time in my life,
I understood what that feels like.

150
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:17,254
Feels like...

151
00:09:17,356 --> 00:09:19,157
No, no. You're thinking
like a nerve guy.

152
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:21,204
- I am a nerve guy.
- It goes blood supply,
then nerves.

153
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:23,039
Actually, it's tendons, then
blood supply, then nerves.

154
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:25,496
Um, hello? What about the bones?

155
00:09:25,598 --> 00:09:28,199
That's certainly something
to take into consideration...

156
00:09:28,302 --> 00:09:33,605
Um, we estimate the surgery will
take anywhere from 15 to 20 hours.

157
00:09:33,707 --> 00:09:38,677
We'll have two ORs going at once.
There'll be five teams of surgeons.

158
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:41,674
One team for each arm, and then a
fifth just to harvest veins from the leg.

159
00:09:41,698 --> 00:09:44,982
You know there's only been one
successful bilateral arm transplant

160
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:46,729
- in the country. In the world.
- In the world.

161
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:50,187
I wouldn't go so far as
calling us medical titans, but...

162
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:52,802
- We are.
- - Not the first time I've been called a titan.

163
00:09:52,826 --> 00:09:55,960
Uh, right now I am prepping

164
00:09:56,062 --> 00:10:00,197
the donor body to extract
antibodies from his blood.

165
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:01,877
This is all in
preparation for later,

166
00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:06,170
when we'll remove, uh,
bone marrow from the donor.

167
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:10,174
And then we'll infuse the marrow
into Zack to reduce the chances

168
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:14,462
of his body rejecting
the arms, which is huge.

169
00:10:14,564 --> 00:10:16,297
More than huge.

170
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:19,717
I mean, I'm no
medical Titan, but...

171
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:22,721
still, it's pretty damn cool.

172
00:10:22,823 --> 00:10:27,191
Uh, yeah, Zack lost his arms four
years ago. It was an accident at work.

173
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:31,096
He is... uh, he was a logger.

174
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:33,564
So it could have gone
either way. I mean,

175
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:36,400
this thing could have come
between us, or it could have

176
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:43,141
brought us closer together. And
for us, I think it's brought us closer.

177
00:10:43,243 --> 00:10:45,088
Literally. I have to
wipe his... for him.

178
00:10:45,112 --> 00:10:47,045
OK, really?

179
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:49,225
That's what you want to talk
about in front of everyone right now?

180
00:10:49,249 --> 00:10:51,449
- I do.
- I'm sorry.

181
00:10:51,551 --> 00:10:53,885
I'd cover my face, but
I don't have any hands.

182
00:10:56,572 --> 00:11:01,910
- You been good since I last saw you?
- - Busy.

183
00:11:02,011 --> 00:11:04,428
Bill and I left town
right after the shooting,

184
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:07,948
and pretty much
never looked back.

185
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:11,268
So far, we've been to Paris,

186
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:15,907
Morocco, Alaska, a
cruise through the Baltic.

187
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:18,475
- What?
- Blew through our savings, but,

188
00:11:18,578 --> 00:11:22,580
- hey, life is short, right?
- Sure is.

189
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:29,687
Is there anything I'm looking
forward to once my surgery is done?

190
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:33,457
Babies.

191
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:35,993
Lots and lots of babies.

192
00:11:36,096 --> 00:11:38,629
Deep breath. Another.

193
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:41,432
<i>Enter security access code.</i>

194
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:49,690
- You're sure?
- I'm sure. I'm sure. I'm sure.

195
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:53,027
- I'm sure.
<i>- Enter security...</i>

196
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:55,946
There are some kinks with
the new security system.

197
00:11:56,048 --> 00:12:01,118
But there are always kinks
when something... new.

198
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,488
But we're working them out.

199
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:08,126
<i>We got this, um, new
state-of-the-art like, lockdown system...</i>

200
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:12,279
<i>To isolate different areas of the
hospital in case of an emergency.</i>

201
00:12:12,382 --> 00:12:16,333
'Cause, um, supposedly,
the last emergency, there were

202
00:12:16,436 --> 00:12:20,037
some people wandering around.

203
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:24,425
Even with the kinks, I think
people feel safer, which is important.

204
00:12:27,364 --> 00:12:30,131
Uh, sorry to interrupt,
chief. I just... I got your page,

205
00:12:30,233 --> 00:12:33,434
- but, hey, I can come back.
- Oh, nonsense.

206
00:12:33,537 --> 00:12:37,705
Congratulations. I just heard the
big news, and I am so proud of you.

207
00:12:37,807 --> 00:12:42,476
- Ah...
- Uh, our very
own Dr. Robbins here

208
00:12:42,579 --> 00:12:45,979
has been awarded the
prestigious Carter Madison Grant.

209
00:12:46,082 --> 00:12:48,282
<i>Yeah, I haven't told
that many people yet.</i>

210
00:12:48,384 --> 00:12:51,602
A Carter Madison Grant? Nobody
wins those. I mean, nobody normal.

211
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:54,906
Just those brainy scientist types
who are from Germany and Sweden.

212
00:12:55,008 --> 00:12:59,476
- Oh, my God! You won! Are you kidding?
- Nope. She is not kidding.

213
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:01,478
- Come here!
- Oh, thank you.

214
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:04,093
<i>No, I didn't apply for the
grant because of the shooting.</i>

215
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:08,202
There are major gaps in the care
of children in developing countries.

216
00:13:08,304 --> 00:13:11,606
Global health initiatives
exist for things like malaria,

217
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:15,476
uh, infectious diseases, immunizations,
but not for pediatric surgery.

218
00:13:15,578 --> 00:13:18,930
With this grant, I could
start to change that.

219
00:13:19,032 --> 00:13:20,948
Well, I applied for this
thing two years ago.

220
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:23,451
I was a completely
different person.

221
00:13:23,553 --> 00:13:27,722
I was new here,
um, a surgical fellow,

222
00:13:27,823 --> 00:13:29,156
single.

223
00:13:29,259 --> 00:13:32,977
<i>But now I have people
here, important people.</i>

224
00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:36,230
<i>Which complicates things.</i>

225
00:13:36,332 --> 00:13:41,752
<i>But this is bigger than me. This
is the opportunity of a lifetime.</i>

226
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:45,055
<i>So, yeah.</i>

227
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:47,875
Of course I'm
accepting the grant.

228
00:13:47,977 --> 00:13:51,946
That just means
I'm moving to Africa.

229
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,744
<i>Coming up on</i> Seattle Medical.

230
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:57,145
How long has he been coding?

231
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:59,264
<i>Dr. Torres? Have you seen this?</i>

232
00:13:59,288 --> 00:14:01,705
Oh, no! Oh, no, no, no!

233
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:04,742
<i>Something like this
could ruin everything.</i>

234
00:14:07,647 --> 00:14:10,564
I mean, not just anyone is a
good arm donation candidate.

235
00:14:10,667 --> 00:14:12,210
Not every candidate
wants donated arms.

236
00:14:12,234 --> 00:14:16,787
Most amputee patients opt
to continue using prosthetics.

237
00:14:18,091 --> 00:14:19,423
Think about it.

238
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:23,194
We're attaching two cadaver
arms to another living person's body.

239
00:14:23,296 --> 00:14:25,842
That's the kind of thing that could
really mess with someone's head.

240
00:14:25,866 --> 00:14:29,067
Not to mention the rehabilitation
time. Recovery from something like this?

241
00:14:29,169 --> 00:14:32,403
- It takes years.
- The screening process
is extensive.

242
00:14:32,505 --> 00:14:36,741
We have to ensure that the recipient
is stable, mentally and physically,

243
00:14:36,843 --> 00:14:40,144
determined,
patient... very patient.

244
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:42,914
And that's all before you
can begin looking for an arm.

245
00:14:43,016 --> 00:14:47,535
<i>In this case, we've been looking for
arms for Zachary for over two years.</i>

246
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:48,647
<i>It's been a long time coming.</i>

247
00:14:48,671 --> 00:14:51,005
- Um, Dr. Torres?
- Hm?

248
00:14:51,107 --> 00:14:56,210
Uh, you've probably seen
this, but have you seen this?

249
00:14:58,414 --> 00:15:02,817
Oh, my God, no.

250
00:15:02,919 --> 00:15:06,954
Oh, no, no, no, no. OK,
um, page Sloan. Right now.

251
00:15:07,056 --> 00:15:09,007
A tattoo?

252
00:15:09,109 --> 00:15:13,361
It's just so unfair that something
like this could ruin everything.

253
00:15:14,497 --> 00:15:16,230
Hi. Is it true?

254
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:20,300
You guys are scrubbing in
on the double arm transplant?

255
00:15:24,941 --> 00:15:27,041
- What's wrong with you?
- Nothing.

256
00:15:27,143 --> 00:15:29,444
What's wrong with you?

257
00:15:29,546 --> 00:15:32,529
Oh, no, yeah, it's a very
real concern, actually.

258
00:15:32,632 --> 00:15:35,233
The patient could
easily reject the arms,

259
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:40,121
not just physically, but emotionally.
The first ever hand transplant recipient

260
00:15:40,223 --> 00:15:42,323
ultimately asked to
have the hand removed.

261
00:15:42,425 --> 00:15:45,593
He said he couldn't connect
to it, that it felt like dead weight

262
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:49,063
sewn onto his body. That the
hand wasn't, and never would be, his.

263
00:15:49,165 --> 00:15:51,911
Imagine looking at a tattoo of
your donor's wife's name every day

264
00:15:51,935 --> 00:15:53,968
to remind you that
these aren't your arms.

265
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:58,623
You're making me nervous. What's
wrong? Is there a problem with the arms?

266
00:15:58,724 --> 00:16:00,658
Oh, God. There's a
problem with the arms.

267
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:04,061
Well... maybe.

268
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:07,715
Um...

269
00:16:07,817 --> 00:16:10,150
There's a tattoo
on one of the arms,

270
00:16:10,253 --> 00:16:12,169
of the name Nicole.

271
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:21,996
- I love the name Nicole.
- Me, too. I love it.

272
00:16:22,098 --> 00:16:24,610
- Couldn't love it more.
- I say we rename
our dog Nicole.

273
00:16:24,634 --> 00:16:27,401
I'm gonna name myself
Nicole. Change my name.

274
00:16:27,503 --> 00:16:32,907
If it means I can still get those
arms, Nicole is my new favorite name.

275
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:37,328
Yeah, I was not expecting that.

276
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:41,815
He got that tattoo exactly
one year after we met.

277
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:45,453
He took me to the tattoo shop and
told me he was gonna get this tattoo

278
00:16:45,555 --> 00:16:49,690
to show me just how much he loved
me, which is when I'm pretty sure

279
00:16:49,792 --> 00:16:53,127
I called him an idiot,
or something worse.

280
00:16:53,229 --> 00:16:57,064
<i>You don't declare your love
for someone by getting a tattoo.</i>

281
00:16:57,166 --> 00:17:03,204
You do normal things, like plan a
nice date, or write a poem or, hell,

282
00:17:03,306 --> 00:17:06,274
drop down on one
knee and propose.

283
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:10,477
You don't brand yourself
with another person's name.

284
00:17:13,482 --> 00:17:15,916
Which is when Sam said, "OK."

285
00:17:16,018 --> 00:17:21,105
And he got down on one knee,
pulled out a ring and proposed.

286
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:23,408
On the spot.

287
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:27,394
After that, every time, even if we
were fighting or I was mad at him

288
00:17:27,497 --> 00:17:32,583
'cause he forgot to take
the garbage cans out or...

289
00:17:34,421 --> 00:17:38,255
I'd catch a glimpse of that
tattoo and I'd remember:

290
00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:41,208
This guy loves me.

291
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:45,363
Even if the garbage is gonna
smell up the yard for a week.

292
00:17:46,366 --> 00:17:48,332
He loves me.

293
00:17:52,105 --> 00:17:54,138
Loved me.

294
00:17:54,957 --> 00:17:57,525
<i>I don't even like kids.</i>

295
00:17:57,627 --> 00:18:00,961
Come on.

296
00:18:10,889 --> 00:18:13,724
<i>Pediatric surgery has
nothing to do with liking kids.</i>

297
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:20,014
All right, Lily. I need you to stay
still, OK, or you'll mess up the test.

298
00:18:20,116 --> 00:18:24,551
I'm gonna be right over there in
that booth. And that's how it goes.

299
00:18:26,022 --> 00:18:30,324
Lily, you can't have
this in the machine, OK?

300
00:18:30,426 --> 00:18:33,260
I'm sorry.

301
00:18:35,198 --> 00:18:39,066
Hey, look, guys, why don't you
back off for a little while, OK?

302
00:18:39,168 --> 00:18:42,186
Hey, it's gonna be OK.

303
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:45,618
<i>You go into Peds
because it's elite,</i>

304
00:18:45,642 --> 00:18:48,609
<i>hardcore, the best of the best.</i>

305
00:19:00,189 --> 00:19:04,658
<i>Did you know that there are only
38 pediatric surgery fellowship spots</i>

306
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:07,161
in the country? The country.

307
00:19:07,263 --> 00:19:11,098
I mean, uh, to compare,
cardiothoracic has 120.

308
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,434
<i>Pediatric surgery is
the elite of the elite.</i>

309
00:19:13,536 --> 00:19:18,973
<i>So yeah, I'd consider specializing
in pediatric surgery. For sure.</i>

310
00:19:19,075 --> 00:19:22,860
But not because of the kids.
Definitely not because of the kids.

311
00:19:27,766 --> 00:19:30,679
- Airway is clear.
- - <i>The truth is that it's actually</i>

312
00:19:30,703 --> 00:19:35,806
<i>a good thing that the shooting
happened here instead of somewhere else,</i>

313
00:19:35,908 --> 00:19:38,325
<i>because we are better
equipped to handle trauma.</i>

314
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:40,678
<i>We see trauma
every day. It's our job.</i>

315
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:43,947
- We got a stab wound there.
- Yeah, I got it.

316
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:47,735
- My monitor.
- Oh, wow.

317
00:19:47,837 --> 00:19:51,038
- Uh, he needs surgery.
- OK. Let's pack it,

318
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:55,075
- stabilize him
and get him upstairs.
- Right. Um...

319
00:19:55,177 --> 00:19:56,922
There's another incoming
trauma on his way in.

320
00:19:56,946 --> 00:19:59,647
So I'm just gonna stay
down here and handle that.

321
00:19:59,749 --> 00:20:02,166
<i>Yeah, I mean, trauma
is a part of our job.</i>

322
00:20:02,268 --> 00:20:06,236
So improvising and thinking on our
feet, that's what we're trained to do.

323
00:20:06,322 --> 00:20:08,673
No, it's not strange
Dr. Yang isn't coming with me.

324
00:20:08,774 --> 00:20:11,608
I was available,
so I'll take this guy.

325
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:14,111
<i>She'll take the next one.
It's first come, first serve.</i>

326
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:17,081
<i>Everyone wants
to get in that OR.</i>

327
00:20:17,183 --> 00:20:20,384
<i>We're surgeons. We
live to cut. It's who we are.</i>

328
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,557
It's not too late, you know.
We could move up our next trip.

329
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:46,793
Skip outta here and then
just catch a plane tonight.

330
00:20:46,896 --> 00:20:49,942
You've been fine this long without the
surgery, you'll be fine a little longer.

331
00:20:49,966 --> 00:20:52,466
<i>Colostomy reversal
is a very basic surgery.</i>

332
00:20:52,568 --> 00:20:57,171
On a typical day, I might
do two or three in a row.

333
00:20:57,273 --> 00:21:01,742
Uh, this was the surgery I was supposed
to perform on Mary that day, the day...

334
00:21:03,713 --> 00:21:05,813
That, um...

335
00:21:05,915 --> 00:21:09,850
Anyway... Um,
medically speaking,

336
00:21:09,952 --> 00:21:14,855
she was getting a little stoma prolapse
and some electrolyte imbalances,

337
00:21:14,957 --> 00:21:17,692
so it's good that we're
doing the surgery now.

338
00:21:17,794 --> 00:21:20,260
It's good to get it over with.

339
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:25,382
So we just got Lily's labs back,
and I'm taking them to Dr. Robbins.

340
00:21:25,484 --> 00:21:28,152
They don't, uh...

341
00:21:28,254 --> 00:21:29,932
- At least you could be happy.
- Well, I thought we were happy!

342
00:21:29,956 --> 00:21:32,789
Uh, should I come back?

343
00:21:32,891 --> 00:21:34,992
No, whatever.
We're done, anyway.

344
00:21:37,096 --> 00:21:39,229
Uh, you have Lily's results?

345
00:21:39,332 --> 00:21:43,650
Well, it's her decision, obviously.
It's an incredible opportunity.

346
00:21:43,752 --> 00:21:47,421
I mean, you don't just, uh, turn
down a Carter Madison Grant.

347
00:21:47,523 --> 00:21:51,992
Nobody turns down a Carter
Madison Grant. I... I know that.

348
00:21:52,094 --> 00:21:54,228
I understand that, I do.

349
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:57,164
I mean, if the situation
were reversed...

350
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:05,172
Actually, no. You know what? No.

351
00:22:05,274 --> 00:22:08,075
If the situation were reversed,
I would turn the thing down.

352
00:22:08,177 --> 00:22:12,079
I wouldn't even consider moving
to another continent right now.

353
00:22:13,816 --> 00:22:15,515
But I'm not her.

354
00:22:15,617 --> 00:22:19,987
So, uh, like I said, it's
an incredible opportunity.

355
00:22:23,993 --> 00:22:26,260
Hope you've got
that bone saw ready,

356
00:22:26,361 --> 00:22:30,131
'cause I am really in the
mood to cut off some arms.

357
00:22:30,233 --> 00:22:32,949
Unfortunately, because
of her prior surgeries,

358
00:22:33,052 --> 00:22:36,387
Lily has fistulas that make removing
her tumor that much more difficult.

359
00:22:36,489 --> 00:22:39,890
The tumor is now so large
that it's impinging on her airway

360
00:22:39,992 --> 00:22:45,095
and esophagus. Removing
the tumor would mean removing

361
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:49,650
Lily's entire trachea, which means
Lily wouldn't be able to breathe.

362
00:22:49,752 --> 00:22:52,469
- At all.
- - <i>The other thing that's changed for me</i>

363
00:22:52,571 --> 00:22:55,472
most since the
shooting is that now

364
00:22:55,575 --> 00:22:59,476
I feel like there's always
something that we can do.

365
00:22:59,579 --> 00:23:03,063
<i>'Cause I should've died.
I was shot point-blank.</i>

366
00:23:03,165 --> 00:23:07,134
So, uh, there's always
something that we can do.

367
00:23:07,236 --> 00:23:11,955
So you're saying
that if you operate,

368
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:16,543
it's a death sentence.
And if you don't operate,

369
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:19,346
it's a death sentence.

370
00:23:31,877 --> 00:23:35,512
So, in a few minutes, we'll be
ready to completely detach the arms

371
00:23:35,614 --> 00:23:38,982
- from the donor.
- Why use zigzag incisions?

372
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:42,319
- To get
maximum exposure.
- Good. See what I'm doing here?

373
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:45,388
I'm tagging each
vessel, artery and vein

374
00:23:45,491 --> 00:23:48,892
so we know exactly how to
hook them up to the recipient.

375
00:23:48,994 --> 00:23:51,027
It's kind of like the
back of your TV.

376
00:23:51,129 --> 00:23:53,296
You need to know which
connection goes where

377
00:23:53,398 --> 00:23:56,767
or you wind up with
sound and no picture,

378
00:23:56,869 --> 00:23:59,069
or picture and no sound.

379
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:12,443
<i>The minute we remove the arms
from the donor, the tissue starts to die.</i>

380
00:24:12,467 --> 00:24:14,585
<i>So we have to
work fast, really fast.</i>

381
00:24:14,687 --> 00:24:18,088
<i>We have a very limited window
to complete this part of the surgery.</i>

382
00:24:30,052 --> 00:24:31,052
OK.

383
00:24:31,153 --> 00:24:33,120
OK, let's get started.

384
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:37,942
You don't understand. I was
sent to get coffee for Dr. Sloan

385
00:24:38,043 --> 00:24:40,222
because he needs
his caffeine. Right now.

386
00:24:40,246 --> 00:24:44,114
To get through the most amazing surgery
that is happening right now in OR 2.

387
00:24:44,217 --> 00:24:47,362
So I'm pretty sure it's not OK to be
late for the making of medical history,

388
00:24:47,386 --> 00:24:49,746
so you need to let me through,
OK, to get to that surgery,

389
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:54,124
to get Dr. Sloan his caffeine, to
witness medical history being made.

390
00:24:54,227 --> 00:24:58,645
- I... My ID is valid,
I promise!
- Let me take a look.

391
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:04,601
She swiped it a couple of
times and it didn't go through.

392
00:25:04,704 --> 00:25:06,887
Go!

393
00:25:06,989 --> 00:25:11,342
<i>- Enter security</i>
<i>access code.</i>
- Hey! Hey!

394
00:25:11,443 --> 00:25:14,044
It's yours now.

395
00:25:17,483 --> 00:25:19,850
Nurse! Come here!

396
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,087
Call maintenance!

397
00:25:23,189 --> 00:25:25,956
Dr. Avery, Dr. Avery,
your patient!

398
00:25:26,058 --> 00:25:28,341
<i>Enter security access code.</i>

399
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:38,001
<i>- Enter security access code.</i>
- Dr. Avery,
hold on! Dr. Avery!

400
00:25:38,103 --> 00:25:39,486
<i>Enter security...</i>

401
00:25:41,023 --> 00:25:42,935
<i>So we're about nine hours in.</i>

402
00:25:42,959 --> 00:25:46,827
<i>Dr. Torres has finished attaching
the donor arm bones to the recipient</i>

403
00:25:46,929 --> 00:25:50,313
<i>with titanium plates and screws,
and now they are beginning</i>

404
00:25:50,415 --> 00:25:52,449
to attach the tendons.

405
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:55,418
I'm on it.

406
00:26:01,877 --> 00:26:04,210
Look that that!

407
00:26:04,312 --> 00:26:07,147
Where have you been?

408
00:26:07,249 --> 00:26:09,650
<i>How's getting shot changed me?</i>

409
00:26:09,751 --> 00:26:15,072
<i>Um, I don't think I love my
job any more or any less.</i>

410
00:26:15,174 --> 00:26:18,242
<i>Um, I don't think, um...</i>

411
00:26:18,344 --> 00:26:19,921
<i>I'm a better doctor, or worse.</i>

412
00:26:19,945 --> 00:26:23,647
Uh, if anything, it's
made me grateful...

413
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:26,883
to be here. So, yeah,
getting shot has changed me

414
00:26:26,986 --> 00:26:30,120
in the sense that I feel lucky.

415
00:26:31,557 --> 00:26:33,773
We've reconnected
the arteries and veins.

416
00:26:33,875 --> 00:26:37,628
But we need to check the
circulation before we continue.

417
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:40,575
What we're gonna do now is release
the tourniquets, one arm at a time,

418
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:43,901
and then look to see if
the blood flows into vessels.

419
00:26:44,002 --> 00:26:47,287
- OK. Moment of truth.
- Releasing
the tourniquet.

420
00:26:57,099 --> 00:26:58,877
- Arm's pinking up!
- Good.

421
00:27:10,729 --> 00:27:13,980
The commute's tough.
We've been coming here

422
00:27:14,083 --> 00:27:16,483
since Lily's tumor got
diagnosed three years ago.

423
00:27:16,585 --> 00:27:20,137
<i>It's just the two of
us, just Lily and I.</i>

424
00:27:20,239 --> 00:27:23,607
<i>We live over three hours away,
so it makes it difficult for me</i>

425
00:27:23,709 --> 00:27:26,727
<i>to come more than twice
a week and weekends.</i>

426
00:27:26,845 --> 00:27:30,630
I hate leaving
her for that long,

427
00:27:30,733 --> 00:27:33,466
but I just want
what's best for her.

428
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:35,535
I want her to live.

429
00:27:35,637 --> 00:27:38,889
Dr. Robbins came to me and she said
there might be something they could do

430
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:44,027
for Lily after all,
something experimental.

431
00:27:44,129 --> 00:27:46,847
Um, that's why you come to
a place like this, you know?

432
00:27:46,949 --> 00:27:50,450
Because even if it is a
commute, three hours on the road,

433
00:27:50,552 --> 00:27:53,920
it's nothing if it'll
save Lily's life.

434
00:27:54,022 --> 00:27:56,907
We've completed a stent to
temporarily help Lily breathe,

435
00:27:57,009 --> 00:27:59,276
and now we're gonna
remove part of her twelfth rib.

436
00:28:08,904 --> 00:28:13,173
See? It's just one more example
of how our doctors here rise.

437
00:28:13,275 --> 00:28:15,942
First, a Carter
Madison Grant winner,

438
00:28:16,044 --> 00:28:20,531
and now, cutting-edge
regenerative medicine.

439
00:28:20,632 --> 00:28:24,701
<i>Well, there's no artificial replacement
for a trachea. We know that.</i>

440
00:28:24,803 --> 00:28:27,571
<i>Then I remembered a
study and I thought, "Well,</i>

441
00:28:27,673 --> 00:28:29,323
what if it isn't artificial?"

442
00:28:29,425 --> 00:28:32,776
We're gonna use some of Lily's own
cells to manufacture her a new trachea.

443
00:28:32,878 --> 00:28:37,281
Grow it in the lab. Remove the damaged
organ, replace it with a newer model.

444
00:28:37,383 --> 00:28:41,001
Outstanding. Absolutely
outstanding, Dr. Robbins.

445
00:28:41,103 --> 00:28:43,586
Let me in there.
Move. Avery, Avery!

446
00:28:43,688 --> 00:28:47,690
Avery, look I was waiting in
radiation. How's the patient?

447
00:28:47,793 --> 00:28:50,560
Damn it! How long
has he been coding?

448
00:28:52,314 --> 00:28:55,148
Avery, you're
gonna break his ribs.

449
00:28:58,837 --> 00:29:00,117
OK, OK.

450
00:29:01,607 --> 00:29:02,834
OK. OK.

451
00:29:02,858 --> 00:29:05,091
The new security system?
Yeah, I'm not a fan.

452
00:29:05,194 --> 00:29:08,995
Compressions only last for so long.
So you call whoever you need to call,

453
00:29:09,097 --> 00:29:11,176
you override whatever
you need to override,

454
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,810
- and you open the...
- door

455
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:15,446
before I report you for the
wrongful death of a patient!

456
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:21,124
Avery. Avery, it's OK.
Just hang in there, OK?

457
00:29:21,226 --> 00:29:22,559
Avery...

458
00:29:24,396 --> 00:29:28,131
You can stop now.
Someone else can take over.

459
00:29:28,233 --> 00:29:31,835
Avery, look at me. Look
at me. You can stop now.

460
00:29:31,937 --> 00:29:34,955
Avery, Avery. It's OK, it's OK.

461
00:29:42,698 --> 00:29:47,667
<i>It's been, uh... hard
since the shooting.</i>

462
00:29:50,572 --> 00:29:54,541
I, uh... I lost some
friends that day.

463
00:29:59,415 --> 00:30:02,432
<i>You learn to think
about things differently.</i>

464
00:30:02,534 --> 00:30:06,986
Like, um, buttoning a
button. You can't do that,

465
00:30:07,088 --> 00:30:12,125
you know, even with the hooks,
so... you know, I just buy Zack t-shirts

466
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:14,093
and hoodies.

467
00:30:14,195 --> 00:30:19,299
He can usually get those on by
himself, by using his hooks and his feet.

468
00:30:20,201 --> 00:30:23,136
I help him bathe in the morning,

469
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:28,007
and brush his teeth and shave.

470
00:30:28,109 --> 00:30:32,245
It took me a long time
to get the hang of that.

471
00:30:32,347 --> 00:30:35,582
But it's all in the
wrist, I've learned.

472
00:30:38,137 --> 00:30:42,305
And it's late.

473
00:30:42,408 --> 00:30:46,776
I thought I would
have an update by now.

474
00:30:46,878 --> 00:30:49,246
So, what's the big deal?
You'll visit her, she'll visit you.

475
00:30:49,348 --> 00:30:52,299
- It's just a plane ride.
- Um, can we not talk
about this right now?

476
00:30:52,401 --> 00:30:56,319
- Arm's getting cyanotic.
- - The vessel attachments are all good.

477
00:31:00,809 --> 00:31:03,521
- Picture. We got picture and no sound.
- Excuse me?

478
00:31:03,545 --> 00:31:06,246
Move over. Just move over.

479
00:31:24,766 --> 00:31:26,666
Any update?

480
00:31:28,504 --> 00:31:31,505
- What? Just tell me.
- Um...

481
00:31:31,607 --> 00:31:36,376
There was a possible
complication with one of the arms.

482
00:31:36,478 --> 00:31:38,111
Complication?

483
00:31:38,213 --> 00:31:44,050
There's a clot and they're
trying to restore blood flow, but...

484
00:31:45,554 --> 00:31:47,754
He could lose it, couldn't he?

485
00:31:54,863 --> 00:31:57,531
One arm is better
than none, right?

486
00:32:02,237 --> 00:32:04,917
- Do you need help?
- - I could retract that for you.

487
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:06,635
- You want me to patch that?
- Gimme a second.

488
00:32:06,659 --> 00:32:09,237
- Are you sure
you don't want me...
- Give me a second!

489
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:12,301
I know what I'm doing. I just
need a second. Everybody shut up.

490
00:32:21,372 --> 00:32:24,157
OK. All right. There.
Picture and sound.

491
00:32:24,259 --> 00:32:26,125
I think.

492
00:32:49,534 --> 00:32:53,102
- That's good. Nicely done.
- Perfect.

493
00:32:53,205 --> 00:32:56,756
<i>Basically, we break the
cartilage down to a cellular level</i>

494
00:32:56,858 --> 00:32:58,591
<i>and turn it into
a protein liquid.</i>

495
00:32:58,693 --> 00:33:01,794
<i>We build a scaffolding
to hold the liquid.</i>

496
00:33:01,896 --> 00:33:04,580
<i>And we cook it in an
incubator to let it grow.</i>

497
00:33:04,682 --> 00:33:08,034
This is the incubator. We're
gonna grow the trachea in here first.

498
00:33:08,136 --> 00:33:12,038
Then, once it's big enough, we're
gonna insert it into Lily's abdomen

499
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:14,524
till it gets stronger. It'll
be there a few months.

500
00:33:14,626 --> 00:33:17,794
Then we'll take that new
trachea and replace her old one.

501
00:33:17,896 --> 00:33:22,115
Some might say that a
shooting would set people back,

502
00:33:22,217 --> 00:33:24,750
then you look at
residents like Dr. Karev,

503
00:33:24,852 --> 00:33:30,090
and attendings like Dr. Robbins,
and you see their innovative thinking,

504
00:33:30,192 --> 00:33:36,129
their resilience. You see them
becoming reinvested in medicine.

505
00:33:38,833 --> 00:33:41,033
It's inspiring, isn't it?

506
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:48,825
I've mobilized the two
intestinal segments,

507
00:33:48,927 --> 00:33:52,729
and I've stapled, and...

508
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:56,466
that's it. Textbook.

509
00:33:56,568 --> 00:33:59,502
In and out in an hour.

510
00:34:02,507 --> 00:34:04,708
Time to close.

511
00:34:08,547 --> 00:34:12,515
It went well. Mary's being
wheeled into recovery right now.

512
00:34:12,618 --> 00:34:16,185
- So it's over?
- It's over.

513
00:34:16,288 --> 00:34:18,622
Oh, God.

514
00:34:19,258 --> 00:34:20,435
- Oh, thank you.
- Oh!

515
00:34:20,459 --> 00:34:22,292
Thank you.

516
00:34:23,628 --> 00:34:25,762
Thank you.

517
00:34:25,864 --> 00:34:27,597
Oh!

518
00:34:27,699 --> 00:34:31,834
<i>This is one surgery I am
happy to have finished.</i>

519
00:34:31,936 --> 00:34:34,387
<i>Tonight?</i>

520
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:37,140
<i>I may very well
take the night off.</i>

521
00:34:37,242 --> 00:34:43,295
Go out. Maybe have
a drink. Who knows?

522
00:34:45,099 --> 00:34:48,735
Oh! Gentlemen and lady,
we gave a man arms today.

523
00:34:48,837 --> 00:34:50,670
- All right.
- I think of it more as I gave

524
00:34:50,772 --> 00:34:52,383
a man arms today, the
rest of you just helped.

525
00:34:52,407 --> 00:34:54,552
Another round for
everybody but my friend here.

526
00:34:54,576 --> 00:34:56,120
That's a nice shirt, by the
way. Where'd you get that?

527
00:34:56,144 --> 00:34:58,411
- The special Titan store?
- You saw the way she saved

528
00:34:58,514 --> 00:35:00,257
that arm today? You wanna
hear something funny?

529
00:35:00,281 --> 00:35:03,416
She hooked up my TV, I'm still
only getting sound out of one speaker.

530
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:09,689
<i>So I'll have to irrigate the
trachea with this protein mixture</i>

531
00:35:09,808 --> 00:35:12,692
a few times a day every
day for the next few weeks.

532
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:16,529
<i>Which means I'll pretty
much be living in this hospital</i>

533
00:35:16,648 --> 00:35:18,781
<i>to make sure it gets done right.</i>

534
00:35:20,134 --> 00:35:23,770
<i>That's my priority, is to
make sure this trachea grows.</i>

535
00:35:24,673 --> 00:35:26,873
<i>And it's my focus.</i>

536
00:35:26,975 --> 00:35:31,894
<i>I'll basically be eating, breathing and
sleeping trachea for the next month.</i>

537
00:35:31,996 --> 00:35:34,597
Do people treat me differently
now, after the shooting?

538
00:35:34,699 --> 00:35:39,518
Uh, well... Um, I mean, yeah.
You're here filming me, so...

539
00:35:39,621 --> 00:35:42,388
I mean, people like to say what
I did was heroic, but it wasn't.

540
00:35:42,490 --> 00:35:46,793
It was just a thing I had to do. I
think people like to have a hero.

541
00:35:46,895 --> 00:35:50,396
And it makes them feel better,

542
00:35:50,498 --> 00:35:54,684
to think that there in the
middle of all that horror,

543
00:35:54,786 --> 00:35:58,872
that there's someone special
working medical miracles.

544
00:35:58,973 --> 00:36:03,610
But... I...

545
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:07,280
I mean, I don't have
super surgical powers.

546
00:36:07,382 --> 00:36:09,282
I mean, I'm... I did what...

547
00:36:09,384 --> 00:36:12,151
Cristina is a hero.

548
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:14,270
Especially to me.

549
00:36:14,372 --> 00:36:17,507
The truth is, is most surgeons

550
00:36:17,609 --> 00:36:20,677
could not have done
what she did that day.

551
00:36:20,779 --> 00:36:23,296
- If you had seen...
- Stop it.

552
00:36:26,301 --> 00:36:28,341
- If you had seen...
- Stop. Please, just can you...

553
00:36:28,403 --> 00:36:30,503
Can you just stop this?

554
00:36:35,844 --> 00:36:37,810
Can we cut?

555
00:36:44,485 --> 00:36:46,819
Just doing a
little construction.

556
00:36:46,921 --> 00:36:49,856
Things are always
evolving around here.

557
00:36:49,958 --> 00:36:53,626
For the better.
Always for the better.

558
00:36:53,728 --> 00:36:56,763
Whoa! Hey!

559
00:36:56,865 --> 00:36:59,331
- How'd you let that happen?
- I don't know.

560
00:36:59,433 --> 00:37:02,001
- You get it cleaned up.
- You guys all right?

561
00:37:02,103 --> 00:37:03,235
Hey, let me give you a hand.

562
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:08,240
Yeah, he already has some feeling
at the tops of his new arms. Look.

563
00:37:08,343 --> 00:37:11,511
Ow! Watch this.

564
00:37:15,016 --> 00:37:16,449
Not bad, huh?

565
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:20,003
Look, right there.

566
00:37:20,105 --> 00:37:24,107
You can barely even see a scar
where they put the tube in last month.

567
00:37:24,209 --> 00:37:28,177
And now I'm back today to get
my new trachea sewn into my belly.

568
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,963
Dr. Karev calls me
the human incubator.

569
00:37:31,065 --> 00:37:35,651
He's been sending me photos
from the lab of my new trachea.

570
00:37:37,322 --> 00:37:39,655
See? Look at that right there.

571
00:37:41,026 --> 00:37:43,692
It's really grown.

572
00:37:43,795 --> 00:37:46,129
See, right there...

573
00:37:46,231 --> 00:37:48,614
I always figured I'd
grow up to be a rock star,

574
00:37:48,716 --> 00:37:52,986
but I might consider
being a doctor now, too.

575
00:37:53,088 --> 00:37:56,655
I mean, Dr. Karev
is pretty cool.

576
00:37:56,758 --> 00:38:00,726
Check it out.
Home-grown trachea.

577
00:38:03,598 --> 00:38:08,868
Whatever you do, just don't screw
around and mess up my trachea, OK?

578
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:12,939
I mean it. I know you think
you're a rock star, but no mosh pits

579
00:38:13,041 --> 00:38:17,294
or crowd surfing. I mean,
Lilith Fair is OK, but...

580
00:38:17,396 --> 00:38:21,647
No drinking or drugs or
smoking or driving drunk

581
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:24,601
or giving your number
out to guys you don't know.

582
00:38:24,703 --> 00:38:26,703
Um...

583
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:30,073
You get that I'm nine?

584
00:38:46,941 --> 00:38:49,101
<i>Well, I really can't believe it.</i>

585
00:38:49,127 --> 00:38:51,828
<i>The big move to Africa is
really just around the corner.</i>

586
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:54,747
Yes, I would say things
are better between us now.

587
00:38:54,849 --> 00:38:58,951
And yes, we worked it out, even
with Arizona moving to Africa.

588
00:38:59,053 --> 00:39:02,855
The fix was, uh, pretty simple,
actually. I'm going with her.

589
00:39:10,531 --> 00:39:13,633
Got you some new flowers. Um...

590
00:39:13,735 --> 00:39:17,169
Yellow ones today, um,
don't ask me what kind.

591
00:39:17,271 --> 00:39:20,573
I have no idea.

592
00:39:28,617 --> 00:39:31,150
They're, uh...
they're pretty, though.

593
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:33,886
Just like you.

594
00:39:36,491 --> 00:39:42,144
It's rare, but sometimes patients
do not wake up from surgery.

595
00:39:42,247 --> 00:39:44,347
With every surgery,
there is a risk.

596
00:39:44,449 --> 00:39:47,733
In this case, the
post operative CT

597
00:39:47,835 --> 00:39:51,387
showed no sign of
stroke, no acute bleed.

598
00:39:51,489 --> 00:39:54,757
We've run PET scans, MRIs,

599
00:39:54,859 --> 00:39:57,059
tried fluids, pressors.

600
00:39:57,161 --> 00:40:01,914
Basically, that's what I have to
go and talk to Bill about today.

601
00:40:02,017 --> 00:40:04,750
Mary has been in a
coma since her surgery.

602
00:40:04,853 --> 00:40:07,637
There's no sign
of brain activity,

603
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:12,391
and now she's septic.
Her organs are failing.

604
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:15,612
Best-case scenario...

605
00:40:15,714 --> 00:40:18,848
um, she'd regain some function

606
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:22,652
and wakes up with extreme
deficits, mentally and physically.

607
00:40:22,754 --> 00:40:28,557
But the chance of her
waking up at this point...

608
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:37,784
It's hard. To imagine someone
surviving a crazy gunman,

609
00:40:37,886 --> 00:40:40,386
and then not to survive
such a simple surgery.

610
00:40:40,488 --> 00:40:45,141
<i>I have to go and
tell Bill that it's time.</i>

611
00:40:48,596 --> 00:40:51,130
<i>He has a decision to make.</i>

612
00:41:17,108 --> 00:41:18,942
Hi.

613
00:41:22,597 --> 00:41:26,566
We went through the scariest thing a
person can go through, and we survived.

614
00:41:26,667 --> 00:41:30,202
<i>So now, every
day is just a gift.</i>

615
00:41:30,304 --> 00:41:33,272
<i>And we're all just blessed.</i>

616
00:41:35,259 --> 00:41:37,026
<i>Blessed to be here,</i>

617
00:41:37,128 --> 00:41:39,195
<i>blessed to be doing
what we do best,</i>

618
00:41:39,297 --> 00:41:41,981
<i>which is saving lives.</i>

619
00:41:44,019 --> 00:41:45,735
<i>Every day.</i>

620
00:41:49,291 --> 00:41:52,091
<i>One life at a time.</i>

621
00:41:54,295 --> 00:41:56,412
<i>We're healed,</i>

622
00:41:56,514 --> 00:42:00,450
<i>so we can continue
healing others.</i>

623
00:42:00,552 --> 00:42:05,154
Is there any one thing you'll
take away from all of this?

624
00:42:11,062 --> 00:42:13,563
Being a hero has its price.
