1
00:00:03,837 --> 00:00:06,049
I'm thinking we
put the tub here.

2
00:00:06,073 --> 00:00:09,041
That way, you can take a bath,
look out the window at the trees.

3
00:00:09,143 --> 00:00:11,977
But that means we have
to move the sink here,

4
00:00:12,079 --> 00:00:14,762
because there's no way we
can get two sinks on that wall.

5
00:00:14,864 --> 00:00:17,399
- OK.
- OK, so do you
want me to move the tub

6
00:00:17,501 --> 00:00:20,618
- or do you want
to share a sink?
- I... have one opinion.

7
00:00:20,721 --> 00:00:24,740
And that is that I just
want a tub deep enough

8
00:00:24,842 --> 00:00:26,775
that covers my
knees and my boobs.

9
00:00:26,877 --> 00:00:29,055
Knees and boobs
at the same time.

10
00:00:29,079 --> 00:00:32,481
- I gotta go. You're useless. Love you.
- Mmm.

11
00:00:32,583 --> 00:00:34,383
The dude's building
you a dream house.

12
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:36,718
I can't read these
stupid things.

13
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:39,404
- You just don't give a crap.
- I'm taking baby drugs

14
00:00:39,506 --> 00:00:41,373
to make my uterus less hostile.

15
00:00:41,475 --> 00:00:45,077
I don't know, it makes my eyes
dry, and I have to squint to see, and...

16
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:48,747
I don't really care enough about the
tub-sink relationship to, you know...

17
00:00:48,849 --> 00:00:51,083
You should talk to that hot OB.

18
00:00:51,168 --> 00:00:55,754
You are always drumming up
reasons to talk to that hot OB.

19
00:00:55,856 --> 00:01:00,058
Everyone figures doctors are the
most responsible people they know.

20
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,744
They hold lives in their
hands, they're not flakes.

21
00:01:02,846 --> 00:01:05,430
They don't lose track
of important details,

22
00:01:05,532 --> 00:01:08,800
or make stunningly
bad judgment calls.

23
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:11,737
'Cause that would be bad. Right?

24
00:01:11,838 --> 00:01:14,139
- Look!
- Nice size.

25
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:16,674
- Good looking placenta.
- Is that an arm?

26
00:01:16,777 --> 00:01:18,543
- Yep.
- Aww.

27
00:01:18,645 --> 00:01:21,680
All good. Did you
schedule an amnio yet?

28
00:01:21,782 --> 00:01:23,281
We don't need an amnio.

29
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:27,836
- Um... We don't?
- Of course we do. We'll set it up.

30
00:01:27,938 --> 00:01:30,616
- Why do we need an amnio?
- I can think of a hundred
reasons why.

31
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,002
You want me to take 'em
down one by one or all together?

32
00:01:33,026 --> 00:01:34,387
It's so nice that
there are three of you.

33
00:01:34,411 --> 00:01:36,239
I gotta go.

34
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:38,141
Don't let her shove a
giant needle in your belly

35
00:01:38,165 --> 00:01:40,915
- before we discuss this.
- It's not giant.

36
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:42,468
Nine inches.

37
00:01:46,891 --> 00:01:48,735
OK. So I'm really
sorry about this.

38
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:51,021
But with a clinical trial,
the paperwork never ends.

39
00:01:51,045 --> 00:01:54,596
Have there been any changes to
your memory in the last week or so?

40
00:01:54,698 --> 00:01:56,732
I don't think it's worse.

41
00:01:56,834 --> 00:01:58,466
I went to see Dr. Kesten,

42
00:01:58,569 --> 00:02:02,571
and couldn't figure out what floor
he's on, but that's always the case.

43
00:02:02,673 --> 00:02:03,938
Well, that place is a maze.

44
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,735
Did you have a problem
or was that scheduled?

45
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,326
No, he's the one who
first diagnosed me.

46
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:11,196
And I was kind of angry when
he said it was Alzheimer's.

47
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:16,985
I... I called him a quack. I
figured I should apologize.

48
00:02:17,087 --> 00:02:19,415
Well, I'm sure
he gets that a lot.

49
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:22,608
Have there been any changes in
your schedule in the last week or so?

50
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:24,826
I don't work.

51
00:02:24,928 --> 00:02:28,146
And... I get lost on the
way to the post office,

52
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:31,048
- so I don't do so many errands.
- - So how about your sleeping

53
00:02:31,134 --> 00:02:35,137
- and your eating?
- Well, we have breakfast
together

54
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:36,938
before the boys leave.

55
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,740
And lunch...

56
00:02:40,277 --> 00:02:44,596
Well, I... I'm not home till
pretty late, so I don't know...

57
00:02:44,681 --> 00:02:47,999
Half a peanut butter
and banana sandwich.

58
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:51,185
I make one when we
get home, and we share it.

59
00:02:51,287 --> 00:02:55,440
OK. And how about the
drugs, any side effects?

60
00:02:58,278 --> 00:03:00,228
- No.
- OK.

61
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:05,751
- The pink ones
make you thirsty.
- Dry mouth. Yeah.

62
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:08,236
And water helps with that?

63
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:16,394
- Yeah.
- OK. Very good.

64
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:21,583
Ricky. Big day.

65
00:03:21,685 --> 00:03:24,252
- Bring it on.
- Is this your sister?

66
00:03:24,354 --> 00:03:27,306
This is my girlfriend. Julia.

67
00:03:27,408 --> 00:03:29,724
You're kidding! He's been
talking about you for months.

68
00:03:29,827 --> 00:03:31,910
I figure if there's ever
a day to take off work,

69
00:03:32,012 --> 00:03:34,379
it's when your boyfriend's
getting new lungs.

70
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:37,215
Smart. She waited
for the real fun.

71
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:38,934
All right, let's do this.

72
00:03:39,035 --> 00:03:41,681
Well, your new lungs should
leave Portland in about two hours.

73
00:03:41,705 --> 00:03:44,922
You haven't taken any of your cystic
fibrosis meds since last night, right?

74
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:47,492
- No food, no water, no drugs.
- Great.

75
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:50,311
So we'll just do one last workup
and then we'll get you to the OR.

76
00:03:50,413 --> 00:03:53,210
And Julia, write down your number,
please, and give it to Dr. Grey.

77
00:03:53,234 --> 00:03:55,017
- Why?
- So we can call you

78
00:03:55,119 --> 00:03:57,159
when Ricky's in surgery
if we have any news.

79
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:02,641
When was the last time you
put in an application to the FDA?

80
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:05,243
- It's been a while.
- Well, it would have to be,

81
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:07,712
because if you had any
recollection of what's involved,

82
00:04:07,815 --> 00:04:12,851
then you wouldn't interrupt me in the middle
of compiling 357 pages of an application.

83
00:04:12,953 --> 00:04:16,154
Do you know how easy it is
to lose one page out of 357?

84
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,568
- It's gotta be quite easy.
- They look for reasons to kill
a study.

85
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:20,336
Do you know what they
consider a good reason?

86
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,828
- A missing...
- One missing page.

87
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:25,997
Now, you're a smart man, Hunt.
You have leadership potential.

88
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,934
Management potential. I mean,
I think you shy away from that.

89
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:32,604
- That may well be, sir.
- You can handle a VIP patient.

90
00:04:32,706 --> 00:04:35,017
If you don't mention
the chief of surgery,

91
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:38,076
they won't ask for the chief of
surgery. Did you mention me?

92
00:04:38,178 --> 00:04:39,722
- I think I did, sir.
- Why would you do that?

93
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:42,058
- Did you not know
about my application?
- I didn't think...

94
00:04:42,082 --> 00:04:44,215
Then what on earth
were you thinking?

95
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:48,837
Your wife, sir. That's
what I was thinking.

96
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:59,464
Just when you thought you
were done, we need more blood.

97
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:01,933
If there's any
left, it's all yours.

98
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:04,475
Well, Dr. Shepherd is going to
come up and take a look at you,

99
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:08,256
and if these labs are clean, we're
gonna move you up to the OR floor.

100
00:05:08,358 --> 00:05:12,861
Hey. Let's keep our fingers crossed and
hope that Mom gets the good stuff, OK?

101
00:05:12,963 --> 00:05:14,546
OK.

102
00:05:14,631 --> 00:05:18,950
Hey, Kyle, what's
this on your neck?

103
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:22,053
That's just my bump. It
doesn't hurt or anything.

104
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:24,922
We've been meaning to
make an appointment, but...

105
00:05:25,024 --> 00:05:26,708
with everything
that's been going on...

106
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:28,292
I'm a full-time job.

107
00:05:28,395 --> 00:05:30,475
You're not, OK? I
should have called.

108
00:05:30,547 --> 00:05:33,215
Well, we have doctors
coming out of our ears here.

109
00:05:33,317 --> 00:05:35,600
So I'll have someone
come up and take a look.

110
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:37,635
It's just one less
thing to worry about.

111
00:05:37,738 --> 00:05:40,588
- Thank you.
- OK.

112
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,979
I was in the cereal aisle, and I
tripped on one of those big displays.

113
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:52,950
Fruit spreads or some nonsense,
and the whole thing came down.

114
00:05:53,053 --> 00:05:55,654
Lido and an epi,
please, 5-0 prolene.

115
00:05:55,756 --> 00:05:57,550
It's a cut, Mark, you
don't have to show off.

116
00:05:57,574 --> 00:06:00,008
You can give me a couple of
Band-Aids and be on your way.

117
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:03,828
- Yeah, that's not
how this is gonna go.
- You tripped on the display,

118
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:06,648
or you tripped over your feet
and fell into the thing, or...?

119
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,650
The chronology
escapes me, Richard.

120
00:06:08,752 --> 00:06:12,153
I was more focused on
the fact that there was jam

121
00:06:12,255 --> 00:06:15,557
and shard glass all over
my coat and my pants,

122
00:06:15,659 --> 00:06:18,120
and the pants of the store manager,
who would not leave me alone

123
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:20,657
until he packed me away
into an ambulance! Ow!

124
00:06:20,681 --> 00:06:24,716
- This whole thing
is just ridiculous!
- This is twice, honey.

125
00:06:24,802 --> 00:06:26,701
- Your wrist...
- It's those shoes!

126
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:30,049
They are supposed to tone your
derriere, but I cannot feel the ground

127
00:06:30,073 --> 00:06:32,874
when I walk on them. I am
going to throw them away.

128
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:36,060
If someone would just give me a
couple of Band-Aids, I can be on my...

129
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:39,898
- You're not going anywhere.
- If you make a big fuss about
this...

130
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,100
Mrs. Webber, I'm about
to put a needle in your face.

131
00:06:43,202 --> 00:06:45,970
I'd be extremely grateful
if you'd stop moving.

132
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:54,145
- Did they come by
with the forms?
- I think I signed 200 of them.

133
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:57,315
That sounds about right.
You just gave us your first born.

134
00:06:57,417 --> 00:07:00,252
- You need a drink of water,
Julia?
- Just...

135
00:07:00,354 --> 00:07:03,021
- asthma. Sorry.
- Nothing brings people together

136
00:07:03,123 --> 00:07:07,742
- like respiratory disorders.
- Romantic!

137
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,497
- Dornase?
- It's mine.

138
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:14,165
It has Julia's name on it.

139
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:17,418
- Rick, why is she on dornase?
- I'm gonna go.

140
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,504
Wait, Julia. Do you
have cystic fibrosis?

141
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:23,442
- Go!
- No, wait a minute. OK? Nobody's going anywhere.

142
00:07:23,544 --> 00:07:25,154
You know how dangerous cystic
fibrosis patients are to each other?

143
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:27,229
- We know.
- - Your disease isn't contagious

144
00:07:27,331 --> 00:07:29,976
to anybody in the general
population. It's not like you can't date,

145
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,850
you just can't... You
can't date each other!

146
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:33,868
You can infect each
other with bacteria,

147
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:36,888
- there's no way you can fight!
- We know!

148
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:40,207
You know how many times
we've heard the warnings?

149
00:07:40,309 --> 00:07:44,195
Never get closer than three
feet from another CF patient.

150
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:47,181
It's a drag, OK? There's
no question, I get it.

151
00:07:47,283 --> 00:07:51,836
No, you don't. Ricky
gets it. Nobody else gets it.

152
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:54,989
We both tried dating,
people can't handle it.

153
00:07:55,092 --> 00:07:57,587
People cringe as soon as you start
coughing, like you're gonna kill them.

154
00:07:57,611 --> 00:08:01,195
- This is dangerous.
- - Depression is dangerous.

155
00:08:01,965 --> 00:08:03,832
Living by yourself,

156
00:08:03,934 --> 00:08:07,101
with nobody who understands
you, that's dangerous.

157
00:08:07,203 --> 00:08:10,838
We spent eight years
making small talk

158
00:08:10,941 --> 00:08:14,809
on opposite sides of a
doctor's waiting room.

159
00:08:16,213 --> 00:08:19,747
And one day, we
decided that life with risk...

160
00:08:19,849 --> 00:08:23,034
was better than
not really living.

161
00:08:23,136 --> 00:08:26,371
We deserve to be together.

162
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:36,864
- Kepner! You're on Peds today?
- Yeah, some kid already puked
on me.

163
00:08:36,966 --> 00:08:39,767
OK, so one of my patient's
son has a lump on his neck.

164
00:08:39,869 --> 00:08:43,471
So would you just do a workup on him,
if it's anything, kick it up to Robbins?

165
00:08:43,573 --> 00:08:46,641
Fine. You owe me one.

166
00:08:46,743 --> 00:08:49,071
- No, I don't.
- I'm doing you a favor,
you owe me one.

167
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:51,980
You're doing your job. I owe
you gratitude and respect.

168
00:08:52,082 --> 00:08:54,015
I already had your respect.

169
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:56,751
Ah, hmm...

170
00:09:00,107 --> 00:09:04,475
- Give Yang all your
patients today.
- I have an SMA embolectomy.

171
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:06,789
Well, I'll take your embolectomy,
Yang can take the rest.

172
00:09:06,813 --> 00:09:10,531
- You take my wife.
- Now I want my embolectomy
even more than I did before.

173
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:15,470
She's fallen and ended up in my
ER, twice. Maybe it's an inner ear thing

174
00:09:15,572 --> 00:09:17,884
affecting her balance. Maybe
it's a pinched nerve. I don't know.

175
00:09:17,908 --> 00:09:21,843
All I know is you're going to
run every test that has a name.

176
00:09:21,945 --> 00:09:24,879
I was looking forward
to my embolectomy.

177
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:27,281
Everyone's unhappy.

178
00:09:27,383 --> 00:09:29,367
Get in here.

179
00:09:29,469 --> 00:09:34,305
- You paged me?
- Yeah, I need you
to check my eyes.

180
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,540
I'm not an eye guy, I don't
know how this crap works.

181
00:09:36,643 --> 00:09:39,844
Well, I already did the
chart, I'm like 20/25.

182
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:42,981
But I... now I need you to look
at my eyes through this thing.

183
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:47,085
Maybe it's glaucoma. Hey, you
could get a prescription for pot.

184
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:50,788
All right. Look up.

185
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:54,525
Look down. Doesn't
look like glaucoma.

186
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:57,745
- Your cornea looks fine.
- Good.

187
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:59,825
Yeah, but you still
can't read the chart.

188
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:03,334
- Yeah, but if I squint...
- Normal people don't squint,
all right?

189
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:06,071
Read the chart. Line eight.

190
00:10:06,173 --> 00:10:08,022
No squinting.

191
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:11,726
D, C, P, I.

192
00:10:11,845 --> 00:10:13,306
- You're blind.
- Shut up.

193
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:14,229
Can you even see me?

194
00:10:14,331 --> 00:10:16,164
Yeah, and you look
like a real moron.

195
00:10:16,266 --> 00:10:19,050
- I need a real eye doctor.
- Can you even see enough
to operate?

196
00:10:19,152 --> 00:10:22,603
When I do the squinting thing, I
see fine. Don't quit your day job.

197
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:25,184
You keep squinting like that,
you're gonna get crow's feet.

198
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:28,560
But I'm good at plastics. You
want me to do something about that?

199
00:10:28,662 --> 00:10:31,662
I've lost too many babies in my time.
Addison terminated, Sloan disappeared.

200
00:10:31,748 --> 00:10:35,083
I'm not letting it happen again, I
don't care what kind of baby it is.

201
00:10:35,185 --> 00:10:38,369
You can't be glib about this. A
special-needs baby can be a very sick baby.

202
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:41,800
We could be talking about a lifetime of
surgeries and hospital stays and pain.

203
00:10:41,824 --> 00:10:43,169
It's not all hugging and
the Special Olympics.

204
00:10:43,193 --> 00:10:46,311
Amnios come with
risks, too. One in some...

205
00:10:46,413 --> 00:10:48,357
not insignificant number
result in miscarriage.

206
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:50,631
One in 300.

207
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:54,335
She's not 45, the Down's rate
isn't all that high in women her age.

208
00:10:54,437 --> 00:10:56,837
Can... Can we have a
minute? Can I just...?

209
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:00,925
- There's no pulling anybody
aside.
- We have a relationship, Mark.

210
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:04,161
- Part of that
doesn't include you.
- She's carrying my kid.

211
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:05,758
She gets a minute,
then I get a minute, too.

212
00:11:05,782 --> 00:11:07,476
You know what? No
one gets a minute!

213
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,220
I have a patient. The
patient gets a minute.

214
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:27,368
I've got a friend who can't see,

215
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:30,971
and she thinks it may
be her fertility meds.

216
00:11:31,073 --> 00:11:35,577
- Your friend?
- You think I'm making it up?

217
00:11:35,678 --> 00:11:38,546
You're looking for
reasons to talk to me.

218
00:11:38,648 --> 00:11:41,432
Because the last time we spoke,
you asked me out and I said no.

219
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,902
So now you're
taking my temperature

220
00:11:44,004 --> 00:11:47,522
to see if I was actually
busy or just not interested.

221
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:51,225
You can't ask me out again, not after
what you perceive to be a rejection,

222
00:11:51,327 --> 00:11:54,128
because even though your
whole rap is about confidence,

223
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:56,192
you're about as
self-assured as a Chihuahua.

224
00:11:56,216 --> 00:12:01,085
Your friend, she doesn't need
my help. If she did, she'd call me.

225
00:12:01,922 --> 00:12:04,789
So I should just
ask you out again?

226
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:08,042
It's a lot simpler,
don't you think?

227
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:12,963
- You free for dinner?
- No. Busy.

228
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:18,347
At first I thought it
was a benign cyst,

229
00:12:18,371 --> 00:12:20,972
but it looks like it's
probably a cystic hygroma.

230
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:23,157
Wow. The trachea
is starting to close off.

231
00:12:23,259 --> 00:12:27,161
Well, I'll move your diverticulectomy,
or maybe Dr. Stark has time for it.

232
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:30,999
- Dr. Stark has time for what?
- I've got a diverticulectomy.

233
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,444
We were hoping
that you could take it.

234
00:12:32,468 --> 00:12:34,380
'Cause this hygroma needs
to come out right away.

235
00:12:34,404 --> 00:12:38,939
Oh, good Lord. Why did you wait
so long? This thing is a time bomb.

236
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:41,075
We just saw the patient
for the first time today.

237
00:12:41,178 --> 00:12:44,211
So what? The parents
don't have health insurance?

238
00:12:44,313 --> 00:12:45,593
They do.

239
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:47,682
Well, why didn't they
get this kid to a doctor?

240
00:12:47,751 --> 00:12:51,519
Kyle's mother has Alzheimer's.
She was diagnosed a few months ago.

241
00:12:51,621 --> 00:12:54,706
And the father has been working like
a dog so their insurance doesn't lapse.

242
00:12:54,808 --> 00:12:57,775
Kyle's taking care of his mom as
much as anyone's taking care of him.

243
00:12:57,877 --> 00:13:02,012
- They're just
underwater right now.
- Yeah. All right.

244
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:05,566
- Call Protective Services.
- What?

245
00:13:05,668 --> 00:13:07,596
At least one of you here
understood that, right?

246
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,598
You can't take Kyle
away from his parents.

247
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:12,323
You just told me they're
not caring for their son.

248
00:13:12,425 --> 00:13:15,945
They are dealing with an
extraordinary set of circumstances.

249
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:17,478
This happens all the time.

250
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:20,060
That's why the state set up a
whole department to deal with it.

251
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:24,569
I've got three specialists on their way in
here to look at a tumor. So I need this room.

252
00:13:24,671 --> 00:13:27,222
- Dr. Stark...
- You've got a surgery
to perform,

253
00:13:27,324 --> 00:13:29,591
assuming the patient's
airway has not already closed.

254
00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:34,762
If it has, well, he's probably dead, and
then, yeah, nobody has to call anybody, right?

255
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:43,288
- You have to call him off.
- We can call a social worker,

256
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:45,824
have him go in and say
hello, ask if they need any help.

257
00:13:45,926 --> 00:13:47,926
- It'll placate him.
- No!

258
00:13:48,028 --> 00:13:50,173
Because once you're in the
system, it'll only get worse.

259
00:13:50,197 --> 00:13:53,664
You're registered as a parent
who neglects his kid. It's over!

260
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:56,216
- You have to call him off!
- He's my boss.

261
00:13:56,319 --> 00:13:57,747
Believe me, I like it
way less than you do.

262
00:13:57,771 --> 00:13:59,765
This family just lost the
ground under their feet.

263
00:13:59,789 --> 00:14:02,956
No one likes the idea of a
ten-year-old taking care of his mother,

264
00:14:03,058 --> 00:14:06,677
but they're doing the best they
can. Maybe Derek's drug helps her,

265
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:09,680
or she could get the
placebo, and in 18 months,

266
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:13,401
she doesn't even know who Kyle is. We can't
let their last couple of years together

267
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:16,232
become some nightmare where they're
fighting to keep Kyle in their house.

268
00:14:16,256 --> 00:14:19,474
- It's enough of a
nightmare already.
- We'll talk to him.

269
00:14:19,576 --> 00:14:22,060
So he shoots us down.
Can't hurt to try, right?

270
00:14:27,216 --> 00:14:30,651
You need me to take your diverticulectomy
while you remove the boy's mass.

271
00:14:30,753 --> 00:14:33,582
Right? My assistant knows my schedule
better than me, just check with her.

272
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:36,707
We think calling Protective
Services is a bad idea.

273
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:39,527
Kyle's mother may not
have a lot of lucid time.

274
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:41,873
These years are gonna be
difficult, but it's all the family has.

275
00:14:41,897 --> 00:14:46,117
- So pulling them apart...
- Do you know when
Protective Services

276
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:48,970
pulls families apart? When
the children are in danger.

277
00:14:49,072 --> 00:14:51,751
When the children aren't in danger,
they go away. They do something else.

278
00:14:51,775 --> 00:14:54,642
They can have a knee-jerk
reaction to certain circumstances.

279
00:14:54,744 --> 00:14:57,678
- Do you think they're idiots?
- I am sure that they are not.

280
00:14:57,797 --> 00:15:00,098
- Heartless wretches?
- No.

281
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,935
Pediatric surgeons can be heartless wretches.
Some would argue that I'm a case in point.

282
00:15:04,037 --> 00:15:07,572
But social workers, on the
other hand, are bleeding hearts.

283
00:15:07,674 --> 00:15:10,157
They're earning peanuts,
doing this thankless work,

284
00:15:10,259 --> 00:15:12,454
and then they get painted
as what? Homewreckers,

285
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:14,678
for simply stepping in when
children are being harmed.

286
00:15:14,731 --> 00:15:16,931
But the boy is not being harmed.

287
00:15:17,033 --> 00:15:18,727
And you're sure
about that, right?

288
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:21,191
You're 100 percent sure?
No shadow of a doubt there?

289
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:23,387
Ah. That must be
a nice feeling, huh?

290
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:27,508
Why don't you be a good
example for your residents.

291
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:31,429
- Make the call.
- Mmm.

292
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:34,732
What are you writing?

293
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:38,536
- Dr. Bailey.
- I'm writing about your ears.

294
00:15:38,638 --> 00:15:42,373
- What about them?
- There's nothing wrong
with them.

295
00:15:42,475 --> 00:15:45,876
- Well, then can I go home now?
- No, ma'am.

296
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:48,162
We are wasting everyone's time.

297
00:15:48,264 --> 00:15:51,632
I tripped at the pharmacy,
I have faulty shoes.

298
00:15:51,734 --> 00:15:55,002
I should not be trying
to tone my derriere.

299
00:15:55,104 --> 00:15:58,773
That flavor of vanity is
unbecoming in a woman my age.

300
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:02,760
- The supermarket.
- Excuse me?

301
00:16:02,862 --> 00:16:05,763
You tripped at the
supermarket, not the pharmacy.

302
00:16:05,865 --> 00:16:07,365
Whatever.

303
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:12,337
The pharmacy aisle. I
needed some cough syrup.

304
00:16:12,439 --> 00:16:14,455
You don't have a cough.

305
00:16:15,425 --> 00:16:17,892
Can you breathe
into this tube for me?

306
00:16:19,362 --> 00:16:22,229
I've had an alcoholic
husband long enough.

307
00:16:22,331 --> 00:16:24,882
I know a breathalyzer
when I see one.

308
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,744
Just breathe into
the tube, please.

309
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:31,572
My husband sent you in here
to test me for inner ear problems

310
00:16:31,674 --> 00:16:35,543
- and balance issues.
- You don't have inner ear
problems.

311
00:16:35,645 --> 00:16:39,012
You don't have balance
issues. You are having accidents,

312
00:16:39,115 --> 00:16:42,483
and you are inconsistent with
your description of the accidents,

313
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:46,487
and those behaviors are consistent with
substance abuse. So I will run a tox screen,

314
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:49,239
I'd like a list of the prescription
drugs in your possession,

315
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:51,025
and I need you to
breathe into this tube.

316
00:16:53,829 --> 00:16:57,415
The miscarriage rate is low. It's
even lower with wildly talented OB's.

317
00:16:57,517 --> 00:16:58,949
And we have
wildly talented OB's.

318
00:16:59,052 --> 00:17:01,230
- It's a risk no matter
who does it.
- OK, you know what?

319
00:17:01,254 --> 00:17:04,321
I'm trying to eat, which is more
important than it's ever been now

320
00:17:04,424 --> 00:17:07,591
because I'm an incubator. OK?
I know what each of you thinks,

321
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:09,893
I'm weighing the
options, I will decide.

322
00:17:09,995 --> 00:17:11,828
- You'll decide?
- Yes, I'm the tie breaker.

323
00:17:11,931 --> 00:17:15,411
And anyhow, I have the bigger
vote, because, as we've discussed,

324
00:17:15,435 --> 00:17:18,001
I vote on behalf of the
baby and on behalf of the...

325
00:17:18,104 --> 00:17:19,381
- Vagina. Right.
- Yeah.

326
00:17:19,405 --> 00:17:21,405
That's not gonna cut it, OK?

327
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:25,309
We're co-parenting. All
of us. This isn't a joke.

328
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:28,045
It's not some cute arrangement
where you humor me

329
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:30,847
and use me for baby-sitting
when you want to see a movie.

330
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:33,384
This is my child. We're
doing this together.

331
00:17:33,486 --> 00:17:36,437
You don't get a bigger
vote. I'm a parent!

332
00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:43,895
Daddy's mad.

333
00:17:43,997 --> 00:17:46,496
So he says we're only gonna
have one sink in the bathroom,

334
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:48,866
like he's hurting me.
Why do you need two?

335
00:17:48,968 --> 00:17:52,553
Well, 'cause men leave
wads of toothpaste in the sink,

336
00:17:52,655 --> 00:17:54,750
and when you have your own
sink, you don't have to look at it,

337
00:17:54,774 --> 00:17:59,911
all dried and congealed and filled
with their fossilized oral bacteria.

338
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:03,281
I leave toothpaste in the sink.

339
00:18:03,383 --> 00:18:06,367
You're supposed to rinse
it every time you brush?

340
00:18:07,703 --> 00:18:10,871
Nobody parented you.
This is to be expected.

341
00:18:10,973 --> 00:18:12,973
You're really gonna move
out and sell your house?

342
00:18:13,058 --> 00:18:16,493
- You gonna miss me?
- I'm gonna miss having
a cheap place to live.

343
00:18:16,579 --> 00:18:21,866
You know, I have trouble seeing fine print,
but I can still see your paws on my food.

344
00:18:21,968 --> 00:18:24,117
Ooh.

345
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:26,148
The fact the two of you haven't

346
00:18:26,172 --> 00:18:29,373
swapped a life-threatening
infection already is a miracle.

347
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:32,909
So maybe God has a
soft spot for you guys,

348
00:18:33,012 --> 00:18:36,780
but once this transplant is done,
Ricky will be on immunosuppressants.

349
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:39,150
Ten times more likely
to get an infection.

350
00:18:39,252 --> 00:18:40,785
Lots of things are risky.

351
00:18:40,887 --> 00:18:42,631
- This is suicide.
- You don't know that.

352
00:18:42,655 --> 00:18:45,923
It doesn't mean anything
to you. You've been happy.

353
00:18:46,025 --> 00:18:48,776
We've been sick our whole lives.
Don't we deserve some happiness?

354
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:51,362
- You'll get it.
- Don't act like it's easy,

355
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:54,226
with your gorgeous eyes and
your white coat. It's insulting.

356
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:55,828
I won't tell you it's easy.

357
00:18:55,852 --> 00:18:57,635
It's not.

358
00:18:57,737 --> 00:19:00,838
But people need these lungs.

359
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:04,509
People can use these
lungs for decades.

360
00:19:04,611 --> 00:19:08,396
Parents with small children. Teenagers
who are just starting their lives.

361
00:19:08,498 --> 00:19:12,883
If the two of you stay together, you
could destroy those lungs within months.

362
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:17,021
These lungs are a
gift. If you squander it...

363
00:19:17,123 --> 00:19:18,789
What we have is a gift.

364
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:26,580
Do you love someone?

365
00:19:26,682 --> 00:19:28,348
If you do, you know.

366
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:32,787
It's rare. And it's a gift.

367
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:41,929
End the relationship, or
you don't get the lungs.

368
00:19:50,623 --> 00:19:53,424
So it's a cyst. And it's
pushing on Kyle's airway,

369
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:55,604
so we should remove
it as soon as possible.

370
00:19:55,628 --> 00:19:59,864
But once it's out, he'll be
fine. And Dr. Robbins is great.

371
00:20:01,633 --> 00:20:04,468
Also, a social worker
may be coming by,

372
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:07,387
just to talk to you and see
how things have been going.

373
00:20:07,489 --> 00:20:10,541
- Is that part
of the clinical trial?
- No.

374
00:20:10,627 --> 00:20:14,111
- It's more of a
formality than anything.
- Yeah. Thank you, but no.

375
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,247
If it's part of the
experiment, we should do...

376
00:20:16,349 --> 00:20:20,234
No. They're worried about Kyle,
OK? It's not part of the experiment.

377
00:20:20,336 --> 00:20:24,654
What? Why? Kyle's fine.
You just said that he's...

378
00:20:24,757 --> 00:20:28,359
- If we refuse, what happens?
- Wait. What's wrong with Kyle?

379
00:20:28,461 --> 00:20:29,905
They think that we're
not taking care of him.

380
00:20:29,929 --> 00:20:31,929
I'm fine. I don't need anything!

381
00:20:32,015 --> 00:20:34,015
- What are you doing?
- No, Allison.

382
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,444
- I don't wanna do this.
- Allison, honey.

383
00:20:35,468 --> 00:20:36,478
I don't wanna
stay here. I don't.

384
00:20:36,502 --> 00:20:37,935
Allison. Stay in the bed!

385
00:20:38,037 --> 00:20:39,181
I don't want them
to touch my son!

386
00:20:39,205 --> 00:20:41,438
- I understand, but...
- I don't want this!

387
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:44,424
We are taking care of our son!

388
00:20:44,527 --> 00:20:46,844
I don't want to be
here! I want to go home!

389
00:20:46,946 --> 00:20:49,847
Listen, you need this
surgery. This is our chance!

390
00:20:49,949 --> 00:20:52,316
- Don't let them touch our son!
- All right...

391
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:55,002
Please, just take me home!

392
00:21:08,951 --> 00:21:11,668
She loves Johnny Cash.

393
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:17,324
He does this. It
always calms her down.

394
00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:30,004
I need an answer. Is it over?

395
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:37,595
Yeah.

396
00:21:39,265 --> 00:21:41,265
It's over.

397
00:21:42,335 --> 00:21:44,251
OK.

398
00:21:45,571 --> 00:21:46,686
OK.

399
00:21:47,924 --> 00:21:49,356
You need to say goodbye.

400
00:21:51,159 --> 00:21:53,861
- Right now.
- This minute?

401
00:21:53,963 --> 00:21:57,448
We need to prep you, and
then cut your chest open.

402
00:21:57,550 --> 00:22:00,717
So yes, this minute.

403
00:22:30,032 --> 00:22:31,749
Hey, Meredith.

404
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:34,651
What was the deal with Adele Webber
when you saw her a few weeks back?

405
00:22:34,754 --> 00:22:37,888
- She fractured her wrist.
- Yeah, but you ordered a head
CT.

406
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:41,425
- Just to be sure,
and it was clear.
- OK, I read the file.

407
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:44,795
What I'm asking for is a more
complete impression of the patient.

408
00:22:44,897 --> 00:22:47,497
I myself just accused her of
being either a wino or a junkie,

409
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,400
and that seems not to be the
case, 'cause the tox screen is clear

410
00:22:50,502 --> 00:22:53,014
and so was the breathalyzer. So
I'm wondering what the hell's going on.

411
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:55,589
She fell down, and she
couldn't get her story straight.

412
00:22:55,691 --> 00:22:58,358
I tried to talk to the chief,
and he got very angry with me

413
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:02,229
because I suggested that there
was some indication of early dementia.

414
00:23:02,331 --> 00:23:07,117
He thinks because I'm on Derek's
study, that I see Alzheimer's everywhere.

415
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:09,286
- Hmm.
- Are you concerned?

416
00:23:09,389 --> 00:23:10,638
Yeah.

417
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:13,290
Did you really call
the chief's wife a wino?

418
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:16,243
My finest moment.

419
00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:29,390
I am so grateful you're
not trying to knock me up.

420
00:23:29,492 --> 00:23:31,258
You're welcome.

421
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,656
The Three Musketeers are all
freaked out about having an amnio.

422
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:37,297
And Meredith is getting shot
up every day with fertility drugs.

423
00:23:37,399 --> 00:23:40,796
It is a nightmare, the
whole thing. And all for what?

424
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:44,488
To sign up for two years of
sleep deprivation and feces?

425
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:48,592
I'm so happy we're never
gonna have to deal with that.

426
00:23:49,861 --> 00:23:51,778
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

427
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:02,105
Well... I want the amnio.

428
00:24:02,207 --> 00:24:05,275
I just... I want to have the
information, whatever it is.

429
00:24:05,377 --> 00:24:07,589
That doesn't mean I'm
gonna act on it, but just... I...

430
00:24:07,613 --> 00:24:10,614
Whatever the situation
is, I want to know about it.

431
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:16,987
OK. Thank you.

432
00:24:17,089 --> 00:24:18,472
W...

433
00:24:18,574 --> 00:24:22,293
- That's it?
- I just wanted her
to think about it.

434
00:24:22,395 --> 00:24:25,045
I wanted all of us to
really think about it.

435
00:24:25,147 --> 00:24:27,497
And you did. There's
three of us, I got outvoted.

436
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:29,833
As long as my 33
percent is considered,

437
00:24:29,935 --> 00:24:34,271
and nobody's body parts
get more of a vote than I do,

438
00:24:34,373 --> 00:24:36,173
that's all I can ask for.

439
00:24:38,244 --> 00:24:41,528
All right. Allison,
the anesthetic is in.

440
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:45,316
I just need to make a slight incision,
and we should be good to go. OK?

441
00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:47,151
Yep.

442
00:24:58,631 --> 00:25:02,566
All right, good. Want to celebrate
by drilling some burr holes?

443
00:25:02,668 --> 00:25:05,703
- I would love to.
- OK, on the black mark.

444
00:25:06,706 --> 00:25:08,605
Easy in, easy out.

445
00:25:10,108 --> 00:25:13,260
OK. Ready?

446
00:25:16,465 --> 00:25:19,032
What's the matter?
Just go ahead and start.

447
00:25:19,135 --> 00:25:20,695
- I can't.
- You can't what?

448
00:25:22,588 --> 00:25:24,437
I can't see it.

449
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:36,833
They're lying. She's just gonna
lay low for a couple weeks,

450
00:25:36,936 --> 00:25:38,130
and then they're
gonna get back together

451
00:25:38,154 --> 00:25:40,454
and destroy this perfectly
good pair of lungs.

452
00:25:40,556 --> 00:25:42,122
She's probably
still in the hospital.

453
00:25:42,241 --> 00:25:43,918
- You want
to stop the transplant?
- It's too late.

454
00:25:43,942 --> 00:25:46,260
The lungs are on their way,
the clock's already ticking.

455
00:25:46,361 --> 00:25:49,412
Maybe it'll be OK.
Maybe it's not a waste.

456
00:25:49,514 --> 00:25:53,733
They love each other. It is
rare. What if they are soul mates?

457
00:25:56,805 --> 00:26:01,925
- You're thinking
about Sloan again.
- No! Why?

458
00:26:02,027 --> 00:26:05,707
He told Callie that he would be
happy to raise a special needs child.

459
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:09,216
He's a good man. I didn't think
about it when I walked away,

460
00:26:09,318 --> 00:26:12,335
- I just got mad and I walked.
- You did think about it.

461
00:26:12,437 --> 00:26:15,338
- You think about everything.
- OK. What if I was wrong?

462
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,742
You really want to be dating a
guy, two women and a baby?

463
00:26:18,844 --> 00:26:22,246
- OK... Well, that sounds bad.
- You think?

464
00:26:24,483 --> 00:26:26,003
- Doctor.
- Yeah?

465
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,880
I said I'm never having kids,
and you said, "Yeah, yeah, yeah".

466
00:26:30,956 --> 00:26:33,456
What exactly does
"yeah, yeah, yeah" mean?

467
00:26:33,558 --> 00:26:35,269
Of course you don't want to
have kids. You're a resident.

468
00:26:35,293 --> 00:26:36,994
I felt the same when
I was starting out.

469
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:41,648
So I figure we could revisit
this conversation down the line.

470
00:26:43,185 --> 00:26:46,619
- We already discussed this.
- Yes, but people change.

471
00:26:46,722 --> 00:26:50,590
And it's possible, in a couple
years, you'll come around.

472
00:26:54,263 --> 00:26:56,583
When have you ever
known me to come around?

473
00:26:58,483 --> 00:27:00,416
The idea that your career

474
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:02,519
is the only thing that
will ever matter to you

475
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:04,588
is, frankly, a young
person's notion.

476
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:06,635
And after what you've been
through these last few months,

477
00:27:06,659 --> 00:27:08,809
I would have thought
you had more...

478
00:27:08,911 --> 00:27:12,262
nuanced vision of this
whole thing already.

479
00:27:12,364 --> 00:27:14,884
So you assumed that
I was gonna grow up,

480
00:27:14,984 --> 00:27:17,818
and that I'm going to get over
my childish vision of my life?

481
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:20,103
That's one way to
put it. I also thought

482
00:27:20,205 --> 00:27:25,042
that you might find a little
room for my vision of life.

483
00:27:29,248 --> 00:27:32,299
Well, I've grown up
as much as I plan to,

484
00:27:32,401 --> 00:27:35,602
and I don't "come around".

485
00:27:41,527 --> 00:27:43,694
- Dr. Avery?
- Ready?

486
00:27:43,796 --> 00:27:46,780
- Yep. Out they come. OK.
- Got it.

487
00:27:46,882 --> 00:27:51,234
Got it? All right, pickups.
And Potts scissors.

488
00:27:52,304 --> 00:27:54,304
Dr. Grey, bring 'em over.

489
00:27:59,078 --> 00:28:00,960
They're beautiful.

490
00:28:01,062 --> 00:28:04,230
He wastes these, I
swear to God, I'll kill him.

491
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:11,154
Are you still gonna
love me if I'm blind,

492
00:28:11,257 --> 00:28:13,697
or does it all go out the window
if I'm not a surgeon anymore?

493
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:15,954
It's not funny. I don't know
how you went into my OR

494
00:28:15,978 --> 00:28:19,045
- and didn't say anything.
- It wasn't intentional.

495
00:28:19,147 --> 00:28:21,181
It started out as
fuzziness in the morning,

496
00:28:21,283 --> 00:28:24,618
and then I didn't
see the big black spot

497
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,221
until I started staring
at Allison's skull.

498
00:28:29,691 --> 00:28:31,553
Metzger's gonna meet
you in ophthalmology

499
00:28:31,577 --> 00:28:33,555
as soon as he's out of
surgery. He could be a while,

500
00:28:33,579 --> 00:28:35,245
so cancel the rest of your day.

501
00:28:35,347 --> 00:28:38,248
And you need to stop the
fertility drugs right away.

502
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:40,800
I can't. There's two
pills left in this cycle.

503
00:28:40,902 --> 00:28:42,603
My egg's about to
drop. I can't stop now.

504
00:28:42,705 --> 00:28:45,588
Yes, you can. You know all
the scary side effects they list

505
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:47,802
on the side of the box? One
of them's happening to you.

506
00:28:47,826 --> 00:28:50,655
We need to make sure this doesn't
permanently damage your eyesight.

507
00:28:50,679 --> 00:28:52,396
This cycle's over.

508
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:10,713
I had a feeling I'd find you here.
The lungs are in. So far, so good.

509
00:29:10,816 --> 00:29:15,001
- Are you gonna
tell her I'm here?
- Dr. Altman? No.

510
00:29:15,121 --> 00:29:17,654
No, I'm pretty sure
you're gonna leave.

511
00:29:20,276 --> 00:29:21,975
Here's the thing.

512
00:29:25,213 --> 00:29:26,363
You're killing him.

513
00:29:26,465 --> 00:29:29,716
You're taking a
gun and killing him.

514
00:29:31,253 --> 00:29:34,588
And there is nothing
romantic about a joint suicide.

515
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:37,407
It's cruel.

516
00:29:37,509 --> 00:29:41,745
To you, to him, to your parents,

517
00:29:41,847 --> 00:29:45,698
and to the family that
just buried someone.

518
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:48,702
Those lungs are gorgeous.

519
00:29:50,439 --> 00:29:52,338
You can't do this.

520
00:29:54,677 --> 00:29:56,910
It always feels like

521
00:29:57,012 --> 00:30:00,246
there is just one person
in this world to love.

522
00:30:01,249 --> 00:30:03,032
And then you find somebody else,

523
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:07,737
and it just seems crazy that you
were ever worried in the first place.

524
00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:13,026
You'll tell him he
has to find someone?

525
00:30:14,863 --> 00:30:18,031
He really has to try, 'cause...

526
00:30:18,133 --> 00:30:20,633
I don't want him to be alone.

527
00:30:38,553 --> 00:30:39,786
Hey.

528
00:30:41,122 --> 00:30:44,524
Allison Baker is in
Dr. Shepherd's Alzheimer's trial.

529
00:30:44,626 --> 00:30:48,845
She has to have follow-up visits
every two weeks for the next three years.

530
00:30:48,947 --> 00:30:50,997
We'll make Kyle come every time.

531
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:55,418
I will do the exam
myself, every two weeks.

532
00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:01,158
Look, Kyle, he's not
just loved, he's cherished.

533
00:31:02,961 --> 00:31:07,330
I would like you to consider putting a
pin in the call to Protective Services.

534
00:31:07,432 --> 00:31:09,700
I thought you
already made the call.

535
00:31:11,136 --> 00:31:13,603
- We didn't.
- Oh.

536
00:31:15,741 --> 00:31:17,021
OK.

537
00:31:18,093 --> 00:31:19,342
Excuse me?

538
00:31:20,645 --> 00:31:23,062
Better not stay too
long, I might reconsider.

539
00:31:23,164 --> 00:31:26,766
- Run away, Dr. Kepner.
- OK.

540
00:31:43,468 --> 00:31:45,068
She's gone.

541
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:48,688
For real. I don't
know how to tell him.

542
00:31:53,127 --> 00:31:56,128
If I had to hear something like
that, I'd want to hear it from you.

543
00:32:30,082 --> 00:32:32,983
- Everything's clear.
- Good.

544
00:32:33,085 --> 00:32:38,021
- She's just got two left feet.
- Could be. I didn't check for
that.

545
00:32:39,591 --> 00:32:43,994
Sir, something's clearly wrong.

546
00:32:44,096 --> 00:32:48,732
Dr. Bailey, when you're rolling
down the far side of the hill,

547
00:32:48,834 --> 00:32:50,933
things fall apart.

548
00:32:53,072 --> 00:32:57,640
Look. If it was me, and my
wife was suddenly accident prone

549
00:32:57,742 --> 00:33:02,278
and losing track of details, I
wouldn't ask the general surgeon

550
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:06,516
who's only been an attending
for a year to check her out.

551
00:33:06,618 --> 00:33:08,584
I'd ask the neuro guy.

552
00:33:08,686 --> 00:33:12,789
The very fancy, extremely
good neurosurgeon,

553
00:33:12,891 --> 00:33:18,812
who happens to be studying
neurological disorders like Alzheimer's.

554
00:33:18,914 --> 00:33:21,214
Who happens to
be a close friend.

555
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:23,784
That's who I'd ask.

556
00:33:23,886 --> 00:33:25,218
But that's just me.

557
00:33:38,066 --> 00:33:40,106
Just wanted to make
sure you were all right.

558
00:33:43,972 --> 00:33:45,939
Ricky's not, that's for sure.

559
00:33:46,041 --> 00:33:48,925
I told Julia that she'd
find somebody else, but...

560
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:52,612
- I'm not sure I believed it.
- She will.

561
00:33:52,714 --> 00:33:54,776
- What if he's her...?
- Soul mate?

562
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:57,501
You gotta be kidding
me with this crap, Lexie.

563
00:33:57,602 --> 00:34:01,238
Nobody has just one soul mate.
That'd be such a dumb system.

564
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:06,025
Look, Ricky and Julia deserve better
than someone who makes them sick.

565
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:09,329
You deserve better, too.

566
00:34:09,431 --> 00:34:12,749
There is more than one
soul mate for everyone.

567
00:34:12,851 --> 00:34:14,684
And someone like you?

568
00:34:14,787 --> 00:34:17,503
There'd be a line out the
door, as soon as word got out.

569
00:34:17,605 --> 00:34:19,172
Would you be in the line?

570
00:34:20,876 --> 00:34:21,891
Yeah.

571
00:34:23,962 --> 00:34:25,928
I'm in line.

572
00:34:33,288 --> 00:34:35,555
I think I have veto power.

573
00:34:35,673 --> 00:34:38,224
I think you don't bring a
human being into this world

574
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:41,327
if one of the parties, like
the mother, doesn't want it.

575
00:34:41,429 --> 00:34:44,815
- What's there left to discuss?
- All right. Let me get this
straight.

576
00:34:44,917 --> 00:34:46,877
You've made a decision,
and I have no say.

577
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:49,819
Zero. So, what if I
think having a family

578
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:53,139
is a huge part of what
it means to be alive?

579
00:34:53,241 --> 00:34:56,443
Well, then you married the wrong
person. You know, maybe you did.

580
00:34:56,545 --> 00:35:01,765
I mean, it was hasty. I was a PTSD
wasteoid, shivering on the couch. I...

581
00:35:03,534 --> 00:35:06,254
- Maybe we didn't think this through.
- - Stop it.

582
00:35:06,337 --> 00:35:08,805
You don't get to pull
that crap with me.

583
00:35:08,907 --> 00:35:12,175
We got married, not because
you were a basket case,

584
00:35:12,277 --> 00:35:14,761
but because we loved each
other and we wanted a life together.

585
00:35:14,863 --> 00:35:16,508
So you don't get to
threaten walking out

586
00:35:16,532 --> 00:35:18,798
just because I had the
gall to express an opinion

587
00:35:18,901 --> 00:35:21,968
that is different to yours.
You need to think about it.

588
00:35:23,705 --> 00:35:28,758
You have an obligation to at least
pretend that you care what the hell I want.

589
00:35:35,701 --> 00:35:37,762
Oh, these are all done,
there's just two more.

590
00:35:37,786 --> 00:35:40,436
- I'd like you
to join me for dinner.
- Come again?

591
00:35:40,539 --> 00:35:44,040
- Dinner.
- Right now?

592
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:47,343
No, I already ate. I'm just
saying, some other night.

593
00:35:48,613 --> 00:35:52,182
- Like...
- You know. I mean, a date.

594
00:35:56,888 --> 00:35:58,266
Did you say you wouldn't
call Child Services

595
00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:01,007
- because you wanted
to go out with me?
- No.

596
00:36:01,109 --> 00:36:05,311
No, actually, I wanted
to go out with you

597
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:09,015
because you convinced
me not to call Child Services.

598
00:36:09,117 --> 00:36:13,152
And nobody's changed
my mind in... ten years.

599
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:15,321
Is that a selling point?

600
00:36:15,424 --> 00:36:17,624
It cuts both ways,
no doubt about it.

601
00:36:20,528 --> 00:36:23,446
If I say no, will you stop
giving me surgeries?

602
00:36:23,548 --> 00:36:27,734
No. Come on, that's sexual
harassment. That's not my style.

603
00:36:27,836 --> 00:36:31,370
Look, just think it over. If
the answer's no, that's fine.

604
00:36:31,472 --> 00:36:35,775
I mean, we'll probably have
to avoid eye contact for a while,

605
00:36:35,877 --> 00:36:38,061
but, I mean, we can
still work together.

606
00:36:39,097 --> 00:36:41,547
Anyway, think about it.

607
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:47,420
I gotta tell you, I was
impressed with Mark today.

608
00:36:47,522 --> 00:36:51,091
He... He is really being
an adult about all this.

609
00:36:51,193 --> 00:36:55,228
- I think he's gonna
be a great dad!
- Yeah.

610
00:36:55,330 --> 00:36:57,130
- Right?
- It'll work.

611
00:37:00,001 --> 00:37:02,969
You didn't think it
was that impressive.

612
00:37:04,339 --> 00:37:06,573
Sure. He handled it.

613
00:37:06,675 --> 00:37:10,093
And not like a four-year-old. Is
that supposed to make me excited?

614
00:37:11,997 --> 00:37:14,397
I thought I was supposed to
be the cranky hormonal one.

615
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:18,551
I'm not cranky. I don't
get excited about Mark.

616
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:22,589
I'm not delighted
by Mark. I love you.

617
00:37:22,691 --> 00:37:25,741
And I can honestly say
I'm gonna love this baby.

618
00:37:25,843 --> 00:37:29,128
But Mark? I somehow ended
up agreeing to a lifetime with...

619
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:33,032
Mark.

620
00:37:33,134 --> 00:37:35,652
A lifetime of decisions:
bottle or sippy cup,

621
00:37:35,754 --> 00:37:38,454
basketball or tap,
Dartmouth or Berkeley.

622
00:37:38,556 --> 00:37:40,957
Hmm.

623
00:37:41,059 --> 00:37:45,712
- Christmas morning with Mark.
- OK.

624
00:37:47,849 --> 00:37:49,649
I never picked him.

625
00:37:49,751 --> 00:37:53,519
And I don't hate him, but
I don't want a life with him.

626
00:37:53,621 --> 00:37:57,340
And yet, somehow,
that's what I got.

627
00:37:57,442 --> 00:38:00,376
What am I supposed
to do, kick him out?

628
00:38:00,479 --> 00:38:03,513
- I mean, it's his kid.
- You don't need
to remind me of that.

629
00:38:03,615 --> 00:38:06,632
- I never, ever forget that.
- Wow.

630
00:38:06,734 --> 00:38:08,467
OK, we're gonna go
down that road again?

631
00:38:08,569 --> 00:38:10,882
Can we just be honest about
the fact that this is some kind of

632
00:38:10,906 --> 00:38:13,473
bi dream come true? You
got the woman that you love,

633
00:38:13,575 --> 00:38:15,953
and the guy best friend,
who's also a great lay.

634
00:38:15,977 --> 00:38:18,422
And then you get a
baby. I mean, you get it all!

635
00:38:18,446 --> 00:38:21,948
And me? This is not my dream.

636
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:24,818
My dream doesn't look like this.

637
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:31,341
Lexie?! Lexie! Are you in here?

638
00:38:31,443 --> 00:38:34,877
- Yeah!
- OK!

639
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:37,380
Stark... Stark
just asked me out!

640
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:39,760
Is that not the weirdest
thing you've ever heard?

641
00:38:39,784 --> 00:38:42,063
- It's pretty weird,
I'll give you that.
- It's weird,

642
00:38:42,087 --> 00:38:45,988
it's weird, it's weird! I
mean, he's old! And mean!

643
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:49,425
He's like the Grinch. The
Grinch asked me to dinner.

644
00:38:49,528 --> 00:38:53,162
- And I said yes!
- You said yes?

645
00:38:53,264 --> 00:38:56,883
- There is a nice man
under there.
- April.

646
00:38:56,985 --> 00:38:59,735
- You think it's weird.
- I do,
but I'm starting to come around.

647
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:02,822
- Can we talk about it later?
- Yeah, OK.

648
00:39:02,924 --> 00:39:05,335
- Well, can I pee
before I go? What?
- April, go downstairs.

649
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:07,576
- This is a shared space.
- Just go downstairs!

650
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:09,395
Ah!

651
00:39:11,999 --> 00:39:14,150
Oh, my God!

652
00:39:16,188 --> 00:39:18,404
We are responsible...

653
00:39:20,442 --> 00:39:22,241
with our patients.

654
00:39:22,343 --> 00:39:26,078
The problem is, we
blow it all out at work.

655
00:39:28,182 --> 00:39:31,216
In our own lives, we
can't think things through,

656
00:39:31,319 --> 00:39:36,288
we don't make the sound choice.
We did that all day at the hospital.

657
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:39,358
When it comes to ourselves,
we've got nothing left.

658
00:39:39,461 --> 00:39:42,979
He knows I don't want kids. Suddenly
I'm ruining his vision of the future?

659
00:39:43,081 --> 00:39:46,315
Don't talk to me about vision.
What if I never get to operate again?

660
00:39:46,418 --> 00:39:48,835
You could be a bartender.
I had a very good time.

661
00:39:48,937 --> 00:39:50,848
Yeah, the whole five
hours you bartended?

662
00:39:50,872 --> 00:39:53,722
- Free drinks.
- You stole those drinks.

663
00:39:53,824 --> 00:39:56,843
Joe didn't give you free drinks.

664
00:39:56,945 --> 00:39:59,378
Your eyes will
clear up. They will.

665
00:40:02,267 --> 00:40:05,301
- How's it going?
- Oh, good. I'm good.

666
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:07,723
Metzger's gonna examine you
every day. Until he clears you,

667
00:40:07,788 --> 00:40:10,306
you don't set a foot in an OR.

668
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:13,042
Well, I can't hold a scalpel,
but I can observe, right?

669
00:40:13,145 --> 00:40:15,195
No. You can't.

670
00:40:18,616 --> 00:40:22,335
- Did he just bench me?
- Damn.

671
00:40:31,445 --> 00:40:34,346
She didn't think she needed
to tell me she couldn't see.

672
00:40:34,448 --> 00:40:37,466
She figured it was,
you know, not relevant.

673
00:40:37,552 --> 00:40:41,854
I don't know if I'm more mad at her
as her husband or as her attending.

674
00:40:41,956 --> 00:40:44,357
You were extraneous to the
process. Kind of like Cristina.

675
00:40:44,459 --> 00:40:46,904
She doesn't need to talk to me
about whether we're gonna have kids.

676
00:40:46,928 --> 00:40:49,528
- That's nice.
- Yeah.

677
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:53,048
Not only do I not have a say,
she doesn't even want to discuss it.

678
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:54,544
They want to hold the cards.

679
00:40:54,568 --> 00:40:56,552
I want you to
imagine, for a minute,

680
00:40:56,654 --> 00:41:01,373
- what it's like trying to
negotiate with two women. Two.
- That's a nightmare.

681
00:41:01,475 --> 00:41:05,495
At least you guys get 50 percent
of the vote. I get a measly 33.

682
00:41:05,597 --> 00:41:08,331
I get 50 with Cristina?
I get maybe ten.

683
00:41:08,433 --> 00:41:10,143
Meredith won't even put
anything down on the table.

684
00:41:10,167 --> 00:41:13,903
She doesn't want me to vote,
she simply omits the information.

685
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:18,390
- Leaving me with zero.
- Gentlemen.

686
00:41:18,492 --> 00:41:21,711
- Chief, wanna join us?
- Can I offer you a nine iron?

687
00:41:21,813 --> 00:41:24,681
I can't stay, I just need to
borrow Shepherd for a minute.

688
00:41:24,783 --> 00:41:27,249
Yeah, sure. What's up, chief?

689
00:41:27,351 --> 00:41:29,452
And is it worth it?

690
00:41:29,554 --> 00:41:31,437
Being responsible?

691
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:37,476
Adele was in the ER today.

692
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:40,313
- Is she all right?
- She just...

693
00:41:40,415 --> 00:41:42,782
- She took a spill,
nothing serious.
- Mm-hm.

694
00:41:42,884 --> 00:41:47,120
But it's the second time recently,
so I had Bailey work her up.

695
00:41:47,238 --> 00:41:51,024
Nothing comes up.
CT, everything's clean.

696
00:41:51,126 --> 00:41:55,879
But she's... foggy.

697
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:03,720
I need you to take a look.

698
00:42:03,822 --> 00:42:05,048
'Cause if you take
your vitamins...

699
00:42:05,072 --> 00:42:07,240
- Of course.
- And pay your taxes

700
00:42:07,342 --> 00:42:09,375
and never cut the line,

701
00:42:09,477 --> 00:42:11,543
the universe still gives
you people to love,

702
00:42:11,645 --> 00:42:15,181
and then lets them slip
through your fingers like water.

703
00:42:15,283 --> 00:42:17,483
And then what have you got?

704
00:42:18,286 --> 00:42:21,753
Vitamins and nothing.
