1
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:16,965
Cristina?

2
00:00:18,235 --> 00:00:22,404
Owen's at the hospital, and I...

3
00:00:22,506 --> 00:00:25,106
- Forget it. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Come on.

4
00:00:25,208 --> 00:00:26,658
Come on.

5
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,995
Well, that's...
that's kinda weird.

6
00:00:30,097 --> 00:00:31,863
Oh, he's asleep. Get in.

7
00:00:31,965 --> 00:00:34,666
<i>Most surgeons
grew up being freaks.</i>

8
00:00:34,768 --> 00:00:39,571
<i>While other kids played outside,</i>

9
00:00:39,673 --> 00:00:41,673
<i>we holed up in our rooms...</i>

10
00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:42,808
Mm.

11
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:45,010
<i>Memorizing the periodic table,</i>

12
00:00:45,112 --> 00:00:50,082
<i>huddling for hours over
our junior microscopes,</i>

13
00:00:50,184 --> 00:00:53,952
<i>dissecting our first frogs.</i>

14
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,744
Almost all of the
surgeons in your program

15
00:01:02,847 --> 00:01:04,212
have been cleared to operate.

16
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:06,274
The remaining cases will
be referred to Dr. Wyatt,

17
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:08,562
and she'll clear those people
when she feels they're ready.

18
00:01:08,586 --> 00:01:10,514
What about Cristina Yang?
What's the timeline there?

19
00:01:10,538 --> 00:01:13,071
Dr. Perkins felt that we
should assign Dr. Yang

20
00:01:13,173 --> 00:01:15,673
to something low-stress
for a few months...

21
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:17,075
research, admin duties.

22
00:01:17,177 --> 00:01:20,128
Administration? That's
the best you can do?

23
00:01:22,382 --> 00:01:24,016
Put her on my service.

24
00:01:24,118 --> 00:01:25,901
She's not on anyone's
service, Derek.

25
00:01:26,003 --> 00:01:28,014
She'll be in the hospital, she
just won't go near a surgery.

26
00:01:28,038 --> 00:01:30,016
Well, you do that,
and she'll leave.

27
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,518
She will not come
back to this program.

28
00:01:31,542 --> 00:01:33,253
- Put her on my service.
- I already tried it, Shepherd.

29
00:01:33,277 --> 00:01:34,604
Hunt's right. She's not ready.

30
00:01:34,628 --> 00:01:36,911
Well, she wasn't ready
before. Maybe now she is.

31
00:01:37,013 --> 00:01:38,124
I think we should
give him a shot.

32
00:01:38,148 --> 00:01:39,525
Well, especially if
nothing else is working.

33
00:01:39,549 --> 00:01:41,800
She crawled under a table
in the O.R. two weeks ago.

34
00:01:41,902 --> 00:01:44,052
Thank you.

35
00:01:44,154 --> 00:01:45,971
If she goes, I go.

36
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:49,424
That's insane.

37
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:51,977
If she goes, I go.

38
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,813
I think they're
talking about you.

39
00:01:54,915 --> 00:01:57,365
It's gonna be OK. I mean,
they... they... they can't

40
00:01:57,467 --> 00:02:01,035
kick you out of the program
for being traumatized.

41
00:02:01,137 --> 00:02:03,138
I don't care what they do.

42
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:07,376
Dr. Yang, you're with me.

43
00:02:07,478 --> 00:02:08,844
What? N-no.

44
00:02:08,945 --> 00:02:10,412
I'm with you.

45
00:02:10,514 --> 00:02:11,924
You're with somebody
else. We're walking, Dr. Yang.

46
00:02:11,948 --> 00:02:14,683
Derek.

47
00:02:16,036 --> 00:02:17,085
Hey.

48
00:02:17,187 --> 00:02:19,087
Where could I find Dr. Shepherd?

49
00:02:19,206 --> 00:02:22,207
- You have an appointment?
- I don't.

50
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:24,793
Uh, could you just point me
in the direction of his office?

51
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:27,228
I'm sorry.

52
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:29,715
She has that look on her face
because the last time someone

53
00:02:29,817 --> 00:02:31,884
walked into this hospital
looking for Dr. Shepherd

54
00:02:31,986 --> 00:02:35,070
- without an appointment,
he shot him.
- Mark! Oh.

55
00:02:35,172 --> 00:02:37,189
Oh, my God!

56
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:39,624
- Hi, Amy.
- You still look hot.

57
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:42,310
And you, uh, look
a lot more grown-up

58
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:44,263
than when I last saw you.

59
00:02:44,365 --> 00:02:47,198
- You can say "hot," you know? 'cause I am. I'm hot.
- No, I can't,

60
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,684
because in my mind, you're
still Derek's 12-year-old sister.

61
00:02:49,786 --> 00:02:51,931
- Huh.
- So what are you
doing in Seattle?

62
00:02:51,955 --> 00:02:54,989
Uh, Derek's an ass
who won't return my calls.

63
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:58,009
Derek's an ass who got
shot and won't return my calls,

64
00:02:58,111 --> 00:03:01,730
so I brought him a present
or a bribe or a peace offering.

65
00:03:01,831 --> 00:03:04,694
- Whatever. I brought him that.
<i>- Imagine how - surprised and relieved we were</i>

66
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:07,569
<i>when we grew up and found
out there were others out there</i>

67
00:03:07,671 --> 00:03:10,538
- <i>just as freaky as we were...</i>
- You brought him Brett Favre?

68
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:14,120
No. I brought him a brain tumor.

69
00:03:14,144 --> 00:03:16,745
<i>Same microscopes,
same dead frogs,</i>

70
00:03:16,847 --> 00:03:20,532
<i>same inexplicable urge to
take human beings apart.</i>

71
00:03:22,469 --> 00:03:24,797
- Talk to Cristina.
- She's in the middle
of a nervous breakdown.

72
00:03:24,821 --> 00:03:26,688
- I can't push her.
- In two weeks, my landlord

73
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:29,440
is gonna hand keys to a
Swedish couple with a truckload

74
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:32,055
- of Swedish furniture,
and I said I'd be gone.
- Teddy, can you...

75
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:34,206
mention it to
Owen, like casually,

76
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:35,809
"Hey, how's the
apartment search going?

77
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:37,960
No pressure, but Callie
and Arizona have a life."

78
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:41,469
"You're crowding them,
and Arizona can't handle it."

79
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,690
Oh, my God. Are...

80
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,876
Teddy, are you OK?

81
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:49,728
Um...

82
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:51,646
Andrew's leaving.

83
00:03:51,748 --> 00:03:55,117
Oh. Oh, no, you
didn't. She got attached.

84
00:03:55,219 --> 00:03:57,803
Oh, no. No, no, no.
You were supposed to be

85
00:03:57,905 --> 00:03:59,854
smart and cool and G.I. Jane.

86
00:03:59,956 --> 00:04:02,608
I know that. I know that.
Instead, I got attached

87
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:05,861
to the trauma guy who swoops
in and swoops out a month later.

88
00:04:05,963 --> 00:04:08,413
I'm such an idiot.
I'm not G.I. Jane.

89
00:04:08,515 --> 00:04:10,064
I'm Attachment Barbie.

90
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:12,117
Oh, you poor thing. Come here.

91
00:04:13,821 --> 00:04:16,488
Come here, come here, come here.

92
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:20,859
You know what would
make you feel better?

93
00:04:20,961 --> 00:04:22,460
What?

94
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:24,312
Telling Owen to get off his ass

95
00:04:24,414 --> 00:04:28,500
and get his traumatized
wife out of our apartment.

96
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:31,136
Meredith is a much
better doctor than me.

97
00:04:31,238 --> 00:04:33,183
- No, she's not.
- I am, too. Sorry, Cristina.

98
00:04:33,207 --> 00:04:35,351
Oh, no. No offense
taken. She... she is.

99
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:37,876
- I'll take my chances.
- OK, how about we compromise?

100
00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:41,212
- Why don't you page me
when you've got something?
- I've got something.

101
00:04:41,315 --> 00:04:42,747
Oh, come on.

102
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:45,350
- Amy?
- Well, if you'd pick
up the damn phone,

103
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:48,198
- I wouldn't have to stalk you.
- Yeah. Why didn't you
call your sister?

104
00:04:48,222 --> 00:04:50,656
- Sister?
- Meredith, Cristina,

105
00:04:50,758 --> 00:04:52,474
- this is Amy.
- Amelia.

106
00:04:52,576 --> 00:04:54,809
He's the only one who
gets to call me Amy.

107
00:04:54,912 --> 00:04:57,278
- Um, nice to
finally meet you.
- Likewise.

108
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:00,381
Amy... Amelia... is
also a neurosurgeon.

109
00:05:00,483 --> 00:05:03,045
- Another one? You Shepherds
grow them like weeds.
- Who's this, your husband?

110
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:05,320
- Derek, this is Tom.
- Todd.

111
00:05:05,422 --> 00:05:08,382
Oh, best of luck to you both.

112
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:12,393
No, we met on the plane. He
has a probable pituitary tumor.

113
00:05:12,495 --> 00:05:14,395
Did she say you
had spongy hands?

114
00:05:14,497 --> 00:05:16,014
Yeah.

115
00:05:16,116 --> 00:05:18,127
- Yeah. Were your hands
on her breasts at the time?
- Yeah.

116
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:19,818
So this was a mile-high hookup?

117
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,887
That doesn't change the
fact that he's a very sick man.

118
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:26,024
- If he has symptoms,
it could be a tumor.
- Not just "could." It... it is.

119
00:05:26,126 --> 00:05:29,927
All right. Well, this fine
lady will find you a surgeon.

120
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:31,796
Derek, she's your sister.

121
00:05:31,898 --> 00:05:35,050
- You can buy her
a cup of coffee.
- I have a lot of sisters,

122
00:05:35,152 --> 00:05:36,830
and if I bought them all coffee,
we wouldn't have anything.

123
00:05:36,854 --> 00:05:39,249
- Derek...
- Todd needs a workup. Will you take care of it?

124
00:05:39,273 --> 00:05:41,867
- I can do it.
- Yang's on my service. Why don't you just go

125
00:05:41,891 --> 00:05:44,542
have a good day with Amy,
OK? She's a laugh a minute.

126
00:05:44,644 --> 00:05:46,544
Can you hold the
door open, please?

127
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:48,112
Thank you.

128
00:05:48,214 --> 00:05:50,047
Easy.

129
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:52,900
OK.

130
00:05:53,003 --> 00:05:55,052
Karev, what are you
waiting for? Get on.

131
00:05:56,739 --> 00:05:59,073
I-I just remembered.
Dr. Hunt needs his lab results.

132
00:05:59,176 --> 00:06:00,219
I'll... I'll meet you up there.

133
00:06:00,243 --> 00:06:01,654
This patient takes
priori... Karev, what...

134
00:06:01,678 --> 00:06:03,044
I can do it.

135
00:06:03,146 --> 00:06:06,080
No, uh, Dr. Kepner has a
couple of patients in the E.R.

136
00:06:06,183 --> 00:06:07,849
Go help her.

137
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:10,685
- Is Dr. Webber going up? I-I need an extra hand.
- He sent me.

138
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:13,555
Oh, uh, I thought you were on
Dr. Shepherd's service today.

139
00:06:13,657 --> 00:06:15,640
He took Cristina.

140
00:06:15,742 --> 00:06:17,959
Why? I mean, why?

141
00:06:18,061 --> 00:06:20,194
You don't think she's
OK, do you? 'Cause I don't.

142
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:22,781
I mean, she was in
the house this morning.

143
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:24,782
Did she spend the night?
Because she's married.

144
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:26,651
It's a little weird
for someone to...

145
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:28,819
April, don't talk
about Cristina.

146
00:06:28,922 --> 00:06:30,788
Just mind your own business.

147
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,324
I'm sorry. Um, I was
just... I was just concerned,

148
00:06:33,427 --> 00:06:35,927
but I will try not to be.

149
00:06:37,531 --> 00:06:39,242
I swear to God, Jerry, if
you don't get out of the car,

150
00:06:39,266 --> 00:06:40,632
I'm gonna break the glass

151
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:42,695
- and drag you through
the freakin' window!
- No!

152
00:06:42,719 --> 00:06:44,781
Um, look, ma'am, this
is an ambulance bay.

153
00:06:44,805 --> 00:06:47,722
It's for doctor and
patient vehicles only.

154
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:50,592
Well, if my idiot husband
would ever get out of the car,

155
00:06:50,694 --> 00:06:53,206
- you'd see he was a patient.
-

156
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:55,379
- Jerry, unlock the door.
- Just take me home, Tess!

157
00:06:55,482 --> 00:06:57,432
- This was a big mistake.
- Um, sir.

158
00:06:57,534 --> 00:06:59,701
If there is something
wrong with you,

159
00:06:59,803 --> 00:07:02,084
you should let us take a look.

160
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:03,454
We can help.

161
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:06,508
Really? Can you
help me with these?

162
00:07:11,247 --> 00:07:14,883
Uh, yes. Yes, we can.

163
00:07:14,985 --> 00:07:19,137
But we can't do anything
until you get out of the car.

164
00:07:22,676 --> 00:07:24,704
You'll have to open
the door for me.

165
00:07:24,728 --> 00:07:26,138
OK. Um...

166
00:07:26,162 --> 00:07:29,030
I need a-a chair. Oh, OK.

167
00:07:32,335 --> 00:07:33,885
Oh, my...

168
00:07:33,987 --> 00:07:35,921
I'm sorry.

169
00:07:36,023 --> 00:07:38,506
People are great, aren't they?

170
00:07:39,877 --> 00:07:42,326
Real sweethearts.

171
00:07:45,165 --> 00:07:47,549
OK.

172
00:07:50,771 --> 00:07:52,671
I am so, so sorry.

173
00:07:52,773 --> 00:07:54,338
You will apologize to him.

174
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:57,103
- Profusely.
- And you will stay by
his side all day...

175
00:07:57,127 --> 00:07:58,877
- Yes.
- Even during lunch.

176
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:01,296
I don't think I'll
be wanting lunch.

177
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:03,615
Yes, yes, I will.

178
00:08:03,717 --> 00:08:06,167
Fine. Go get Dr. Sloan.

179
00:08:08,037 --> 00:08:11,539
Decreased breath
sounds on the right side.

180
00:08:11,641 --> 00:08:14,192
I wasn't trying to
hurt your feelings.

181
00:08:14,294 --> 00:08:16,861
There's a few things
I don't talk about,

182
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:19,403
- and Cristina's one of them.
- Um, so is there any chest pain

183
00:08:19,482 --> 00:08:21,242
or is it just
difficulty breathing?

184
00:08:21,284 --> 00:08:22,650
Uh, it's... it's kinda both.

185
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:25,186
- It's cancer.
- It's not cancer.

186
00:08:25,288 --> 00:08:28,022
Ooh, it's cancer or it's, um...

187
00:08:28,124 --> 00:08:29,491
anxiety about the wedding.

188
00:08:29,593 --> 00:08:31,571
- Oh, when are you
getting married?
- Two weeks.

189
00:08:31,595 --> 00:08:33,940
Well, we're gonna need
to get a chest X-ray,

190
00:08:33,964 --> 00:08:35,908
so is there any chance
that you could be pregnant?

191
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:37,615
Oh...

192
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:40,018
- Mnh-mnh. Not pregnant.
- You're sure?

193
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:42,837
- She's sure.
- Mm-hmm. Really super sure.

194
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:45,389
Shut up.

195
00:08:45,491 --> 00:08:47,175
Um, uh,

196
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:49,477
I am a virgin.

197
00:08:49,579 --> 00:08:51,979
Yeah. Uh, we're
waiting for the wedding.

198
00:08:52,081 --> 00:08:54,732
Danny's had sex before.

199
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:56,668
It is important to him
that you know that.

200
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:58,519
I didn't say anything.

201
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:02,306
- OK. They think we're freaks.
- No, we don't.

202
00:09:02,408 --> 00:09:04,368
- No, not at all.
- No, they think you're a freak,

203
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:07,195
and I'm just very,
very understanding.

204
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:11,298
Dr. Sloan, Dr. Bailey
needs a consult

205
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,867
in room 11-35.

206
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:14,736
I'll be right over.

207
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,627
Look away.

208
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:23,945
What?

209
00:09:24,047 --> 00:09:27,048
- Stop staring at her.
- I can't.

210
00:09:31,888 --> 00:09:34,606
Her last words to you
were, "Leave me alone,

211
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:37,609
leave me alone, leave me
alone," only louder. Look away.

212
00:09:37,711 --> 00:09:39,611
Maybe she just needs
a little more time.

213
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:43,365
I'll try to look away.

214
00:09:43,467 --> 00:09:45,166
Thank you.

215
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:50,788
Did it hurt?

216
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:53,925
Getting shot? Oh,
you're amazing.

217
00:09:54,027 --> 00:09:56,460
Well, did you feel the bullet
or did you just feel pain?

218
00:09:56,562 --> 00:09:58,813
I feel pain now because
you won't stop talking.

219
00:09:58,915 --> 00:10:01,699
And we have images.

220
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:04,902
- Yeah, there it is.
- Dr. Yang, what's
the best approach

221
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:07,739
- on a tumor like this?
- I don't know.

222
00:10:07,841 --> 00:10:09,274
Y...

223
00:10:09,376 --> 00:10:11,425
It's a pituitary tumor,

224
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:16,648
so your, uh, access
would be coming in from?

225
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:20,301
You go in transnasally.
Can we book an O.R.?

226
00:10:20,403 --> 00:10:22,131
What's the chance of me
finishing a thought today?

227
00:10:22,155 --> 00:10:23,466
Not great. Um, there's
some compression,

228
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:24,867
so I'd like to get in
sooner than later.

229
00:10:24,891 --> 00:10:26,552
Dr. Yang, can you
book an O.R., please?

230
00:10:26,576 --> 00:10:27,856
You'll be scrubbing in.

231
00:10:27,894 --> 00:10:29,705
You know, if she wants to
do it, you know, be my guest.

232
00:10:29,729 --> 00:10:32,012
- Dr. Yang, book an O.R.
- Fine.

233
00:10:34,817 --> 00:10:37,102
OK, that's my patient in there.

234
00:10:37,204 --> 00:10:39,086
You're gonna let what's-her-face

235
00:10:39,188 --> 00:10:41,089
with the learning
disability scrub in?

236
00:10:41,191 --> 00:10:42,434
Why don't you
just shoot the guy?

237
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:44,492
Don't talk about shooting
people in this building.

238
00:10:44,594 --> 00:10:46,394
Don't criticize my surgeons.

239
00:10:46,496 --> 00:10:48,796
Leave your patient. Go home.

240
00:10:52,084 --> 00:10:54,435
Um, Mr. Adams,
sometime in your history,

241
00:10:54,537 --> 00:10:55,953
you contracted H.P.V.

242
00:10:56,056 --> 00:10:58,606
There are various
types of the virus.

243
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:00,341
This one generally
causes small warts.

244
00:11:00,443 --> 00:11:03,427
But in rare cases like yours,
there's an immune deficiency

245
00:11:03,513 --> 00:11:06,964
that allows the warts
to get out of control.

246
00:11:07,067 --> 00:11:09,934
We went to a dermatologist
in Pullman four years ago.

247
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:11,952
They were a lot smaller then.

248
00:11:12,054 --> 00:11:14,316
- He removed
a bunch of them, but...
- They grew back.

249
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,857
Then we saw the guy again,
and they grew back again.

250
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,294
They're always gonna grow back.

251
00:11:19,396 --> 00:11:20,639
And that's why we
should just go home.

252
00:11:20,663 --> 00:11:22,041
Well, if you don't
do anything about it,

253
00:11:22,065 --> 00:11:23,981
they're gonna continue to grow.

254
00:11:24,084 --> 00:11:26,401
You'll become
completely disabled.

255
00:11:26,503 --> 00:11:28,319
We need to do surgery.

256
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:30,365
You can't just
scrape the stuff off?

257
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:34,041
No. Um, each one of the
warts has its own blood supply.

258
00:11:34,144 --> 00:11:36,177
So we need to cut
and stitch each one.

259
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:39,497
So basically, I'm gonna
go from looking like a tree

260
00:11:39,599 --> 00:11:42,350
to looking like
Frankenstein, right?

261
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:44,018
Super.

262
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,071
Well, we'll be doing skin
grafts at the same time,

263
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:50,241
which will help with your
appearance and function.

264
00:11:50,343 --> 00:11:53,011
That said, you're
right, it's not a cure.

265
00:11:53,113 --> 00:11:56,030
The warts will recur, but if you
schedule surgeries regularly,

266
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:58,065
we might be able to
keep them under control.

267
00:11:58,168 --> 00:12:00,184
Do you see? It's
what I told you.

268
00:12:00,287 --> 00:12:01,652
They can't help.

269
00:12:01,754 --> 00:12:05,072
So a couple of years
with me is, what...

270
00:12:05,174 --> 00:12:06,758
a waste of time?

271
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,325
We never go out, Jerry.

272
00:12:08,411 --> 00:12:11,446
We sit in that damn house,
day after day, month after month.

273
00:12:11,547 --> 00:12:13,964
I want us to see a movie,

274
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:15,967
to go out to dinner,

275
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:18,502
I want to see... people.

276
00:12:18,605 --> 00:12:21,022
Um, if the two of you
want to discuss it, we can...

277
00:12:21,124 --> 00:12:22,857
No.

278
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,293
There's no more discussion.

279
00:12:25,395 --> 00:12:28,730
You're having the surgery,

280
00:12:28,832 --> 00:12:30,531
'cause if you don't,

281
00:12:30,633 --> 00:12:33,317
I'm gonna leave you.

282
00:12:34,821 --> 00:12:37,154
And you got nobody
else... no friends,

283
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:39,624
even your brothers
have given up.

284
00:12:39,726 --> 00:12:41,876
I'm it. I'm all that's left.

285
00:12:41,978 --> 00:12:45,463
So you're having the surgery.

286
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:49,116
Hey.

287
00:12:49,219 --> 00:12:50,718
Got a bronchial obstruction.

288
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,337
Nice.

289
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:54,889
You think it's bad if I write
my own name on your board?

290
00:12:54,991 --> 00:12:57,008
I mean, I did
bring in the patient,

291
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,260
and they gave me privileges.

292
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:01,646
Shepherd and Shepherd.

293
00:13:01,748 --> 00:13:03,064
Classic.

294
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:05,399
What's going on?

295
00:13:05,501 --> 00:13:07,635
You think I'm gonna
let you do to him

296
00:13:07,737 --> 00:13:09,803
what you did to my
Mustang? I don't think so.

297
00:13:13,426 --> 00:13:16,394
She's your sister. I...
you're being like this

298
00:13:16,496 --> 00:13:18,816
because she crashed your
car a couple of years ago?

299
00:13:18,914 --> 00:13:20,576
I totaled my mom's car.
People make mistakes.

300
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,178
Right. When you
totaled your mother's car,

301
00:13:22,202 --> 00:13:23,734
were you high on pain pills?

302
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:26,076
- No.
- Did you steal your
mother's prescription pad

303
00:13:26,106 --> 00:13:27,386
so you could feed
your addiction?

304
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,084
She stole your prescription pad?

305
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:31,759
Yeah, and then when she
went home, she O.D.'ed.

306
00:13:31,861 --> 00:13:33,627
She was dead for three
minutes. I saved her.

307
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:36,264
That's what she put my mother
through after losing my father

308
00:13:36,366 --> 00:13:38,266
and raising five
kids on her own,

309
00:13:38,368 --> 00:13:40,951
so, no, I don't trust
her in my O.R., OK?

310
00:13:42,355 --> 00:13:44,122
Hey, you paged me.
Is everything OK?

311
00:13:44,224 --> 00:13:46,335
I have to get away from Shepherd

312
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:47,758
for, like, ten minutes.

313
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,872
He's like the K.G.B.
He's everywhere.

314
00:13:49,896 --> 00:13:51,396
He's trying to help.

315
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:53,831
Yeah? Well, make him stop.

316
00:14:05,462 --> 00:14:08,796
Would you love me
if I wasn't a surgeon?

317
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:18,990
I would love you if
you were a plumber.

318
00:14:21,928 --> 00:14:25,629
But would<i> you</i> love you
if you weren't a surgeon?

319
00:14:28,184 --> 00:14:29,984
I don't know.

320
00:14:30,086 --> 00:14:33,054
Maybe.

321
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:46,350
I can't sleep when
you're not there.

322
00:14:51,757 --> 00:14:54,858
Then I'll be there.

323
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:07,471
Chief.

324
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:09,073
Karev.

325
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:12,810
Oh, hey.

326
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:15,124
Um, can you talk to Cristina
about getting her own place?

327
00:15:15,148 --> 00:15:17,482
Arizona's about to move
in, and it's kinda crowded.

328
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:20,464
They want to move out. It's just,
they haven't gotten their act together.

329
00:15:20,553 --> 00:15:22,970
And, uh, if I ask her
about it, I'm a bitch.

330
00:15:23,072 --> 00:15:25,289
But if you ask her about
it, you're her best friend,

331
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:29,377
inquiring about a healthy
next step in her married life.

332
00:15:29,479 --> 00:15:31,540
Cristina's career is
hanging on by a thread.

333
00:15:31,564 --> 00:15:33,364
She can't look at an O.R.

334
00:15:33,466 --> 00:15:35,427
without breaking into a cold
sweat, she's a newlywed,

335
00:15:35,451 --> 00:15:37,396
and last night,
she slept in my bed

336
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:39,887
because Owen was in surgery,
and she was afraid to be alone.

337
00:15:40,006 --> 00:15:43,174
You<i> really</i> want to put
her out of her house?

338
00:15:45,078 --> 00:15:47,578
Did you talk to
her about Cristina?

339
00:15:47,681 --> 00:15:51,048
We're monsters.

340
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,967
Hmm?

341
00:15:53,069 --> 00:15:56,220
A virgin... at 27?

342
00:15:56,323 --> 00:15:57,755
Yep.

343
00:15:57,857 --> 00:16:00,319
Well, maybe she was waiting
for the right person to come along,

344
00:16:00,343 --> 00:16:02,660
someone special,
someone who really got her.

345
00:16:02,762 --> 00:16:04,344
It's sweet. It's...

346
00:16:04,447 --> 00:16:06,931
- It's idealistic.
- It's smart is what it is.

347
00:16:07,033 --> 00:16:09,717
If you don't sleep with 'em,
you... you don't get attached.

348
00:16:09,819 --> 00:16:11,859
Y-you sleep with them,
and then you get attached

349
00:16:11,937 --> 00:16:14,016
even when you don't want to,
even when you specifically pick

350
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,306
someone that you are sure

351
00:16:15,408 --> 00:16:17,541
that you couldn't
possibly get attached,

352
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:20,244
and then boom... you're hooked.

353
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:21,346
Graspers.

354
00:16:21,431 --> 00:16:23,797
Is that the mass?

355
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:25,699
Yep.

356
00:16:25,801 --> 00:16:27,718
Is it a tumor?

357
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:32,206
No, it... it looks
like... a foreign object.

358
00:16:32,308 --> 00:16:34,591
All right. I got it.

359
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:40,698
What the hell is that?

360
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,194
- A condom?
- Yep.

361
00:16:42,218 --> 00:16:43,896
Wait, and she aspirated it?

362
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,787
A condom in her
lung? I'm gonna gag.

363
00:16:46,889 --> 00:16:49,068
And her fiancé
thinks she's a virgin.

364
00:16:49,092 --> 00:16:51,376
- So I...
- OK, here we go. Here we go.

365
00:16:51,478 --> 00:16:53,961
- Check it out.
- Ew. Ew. Ew.

366
00:16:54,063 --> 00:16:56,997
OK, now I think I'm gonna gag.

367
00:16:57,116 --> 00:16:58,778
Oh, look at Grey. It looks
like she's gonna heave.

368
00:16:58,802 --> 00:17:00,162
She's looked like that all day.

369
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:02,153
I mean, I kinda
wish I was in there.

370
00:17:02,255 --> 00:17:03,654
What?

371
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:06,290
Seriously, how often does
a case like this come along?

372
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:08,893
About as often as
27-year-old virgin brides.

373
00:17:08,995 --> 00:17:10,645
She could still be a virgin.

374
00:17:10,747 --> 00:17:13,981
Just 'cause she's 27, I
mean, it's... it's not impossible.

375
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:15,603
- Hey.
- Hey.

376
00:17:15,668 --> 00:17:17,501
My wife is sleeping in your bed.

377
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:19,563
Yes, she is, with
Meredith, technically.

378
00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:21,038
She's sleeping with Meredith.

379
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,018
- I'm on the other side
of the bed.
- That... I'm sorry.

380
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:25,576
- Don't you find that
a little strange?
- Mm-hmm.

381
00:17:25,678 --> 00:17:27,344
Did you see<i> E.T.?</i>

382
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:29,324
- The movie? Yeah. Years ago. Why?
- Remember the kid... Elliott?

383
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:32,350
- Mm-hmm.
- He and E.T. had this
weird and disturbing bond.

384
00:17:32,452 --> 00:17:34,335
If he got sick, E.T. got sick.

385
00:17:34,437 --> 00:17:36,337
If E.T. got drunk,
Elliott would get drunk.

386
00:17:36,439 --> 00:17:38,171
That's kinda like
Cristina and Meredith.

387
00:17:38,273 --> 00:17:40,157
Meanwhile, you and I are like

388
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:42,576
the, um, the government
guys in the white hazmat suits.

389
00:17:42,678 --> 00:17:44,890
You know, we're trying to
steer 'em in the right direction,

390
00:17:44,914 --> 00:17:47,398
but in the end, we
just don't understand.

391
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,550
And you're OK with that?

392
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:53,020
I fish. I'm building a house.
I've recently taken up golf.

393
00:17:53,122 --> 00:17:54,838
That helps.

394
00:17:56,626 --> 00:17:58,159
I'm looking out for her.

395
00:17:58,261 --> 00:18:00,027
Thank you.

396
00:18:00,129 --> 00:18:01,662
So, Karev,

397
00:18:01,764 --> 00:18:03,481
how old were
you your first time?

398
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:06,384
15. School nurse,
back of her car.

399
00:18:06,486 --> 00:18:08,185
15? That's impressive.

400
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:12,006
When I was 16, she taught
me how to drive that same car.

401
00:18:12,108 --> 00:18:14,002
Sophomore in high
school, Paul Waxman,

402
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:16,711
had absolutely no
idea what he was doing.

403
00:18:16,813 --> 00:18:18,278
Mm.

404
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:21,332
Junior prom, Sarah
Richardson and Penny Caraway,

405
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:22,927
together.

406
00:18:22,951 --> 00:18:24,868
I knew exactly what I was doing.

407
00:18:24,954 --> 00:18:26,737
19.

408
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:29,084
- 19?
- Mm-hmm. I was very
focused on my studies.

409
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:31,909
It was my Chem T.A. He was
a whole head shorter than me,

410
00:18:32,011 --> 00:18:34,511
but... man, he was smart.

411
00:18:37,383 --> 00:18:39,650
Hey, April.

412
00:18:39,752 --> 00:18:42,820
I'm not talking about this. It
was a private... private memory.

413
00:18:42,922 --> 00:18:44,388
What happened, did the guy die?

414
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:46,569
- Alex.
- Oh, did it last,
like, three seconds,

415
00:18:46,593 --> 00:18:49,020
- so you don't know if it counted?
- - No.

416
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:50,944
Mm-hmm.

417
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:52,546
Uh...

418
00:18:52,648 --> 00:18:54,528
It was on the beach at
sunset. It was beautiful.

419
00:18:54,584 --> 00:18:56,316
Sunset?

420
00:18:56,419 --> 00:18:58,663
- Yeah.
- Really? Weren't
there people there?

421
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:01,438
Oh, on the beach? Man,
you get sand up in places

422
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,518
- you don't want to get sand.
- Mosquitoes.

423
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:06,210
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.
- Ha! You're a virgin.

424
00:19:06,295 --> 00:19:08,578
- No, I'm not.
- Oh, my God. You are!

425
00:19:08,664 --> 00:19:11,326
She is.
- Oh, my God. Do it. Do it. Do it to her right now.

426
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,883
Alex, go deflower
her. Do it. Do it.

427
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,852
It was... it was on the
beach at sunset, OK?

428
00:19:14,954 --> 00:19:16,234
OK, leave her alone.

429
00:19:16,271 --> 00:19:19,240
April, the beach at
sunset is very nice.

430
00:19:23,212 --> 00:19:26,213
There's a gallery upstairs.
Have a seat. You can watch.

431
00:19:26,315 --> 00:19:28,566
OK, you know what, smart boy?

432
00:19:28,651 --> 00:19:31,735
You can pretend like we
aren't related, but we are.

433
00:19:31,838 --> 00:19:34,038
And something happened to you.

434
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:36,006
What is it that you
want from me, Amy?

435
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:37,903
OK, can you imagine for a second

436
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:39,688
that this is not all about you?

437
00:19:39,712 --> 00:19:41,690
Two men in my
family have been shot,

438
00:19:41,714 --> 00:19:44,382
one of them didn't
survive it, and even that

439
00:19:44,484 --> 00:19:46,728
I can't talk about because I
was 5, and I barely remember it.

440
00:19:46,752 --> 00:19:49,586
- Don't make this about Dad.
- We can't make it
about anything!

441
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:51,533
You won't talk about Dad.
You won't talk about this.

442
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:52,456
I'm sorry this is hard for you.

443
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:54,458
It's been hard
for a lot of people.

444
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,311
Now I have an operation
I have to go do. Go home.

445
00:19:57,413 --> 00:19:59,497
No, I'm not going
anywhere. He's my patient.

446
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:02,460
- I'm helping you.
- I don't need help. I have an
exceedingly capable resident.

447
00:20:02,484 --> 00:20:03,934
Really?

448
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:07,572
Uh, sorry I'm late. There's
a long line at the cafeteria.

449
00:20:07,674 --> 00:20:10,257
You're right. Crack team.

450
00:20:10,359 --> 00:20:12,326
Fine. You can stay.

451
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:24,533
Dr. Bailey, how can you tell

452
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:26,535
which is horn and
which is finger?

453
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:30,611
If there's no bleeding,
I'm still cutting off the horn.

454
00:20:30,713 --> 00:20:33,180
If there's a lot of bleeding,

455
00:20:33,282 --> 00:20:35,015
I'm probably
cutting off a finger.

456
00:20:35,117 --> 00:20:38,151
Sometimes this job is
very simple, Dr. Avery.

457
00:20:40,206 --> 00:20:41,822
Oh.

458
00:20:41,924 --> 00:20:44,608
I can do that if you want.

459
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:47,445
She's fine. Right, Dr. Grey?

460
00:20:47,547 --> 00:20:50,381
Right.

461
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:55,402
Ugh.

462
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:57,938
What?

463
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,339
Nothing.

464
00:21:03,579 --> 00:21:05,579
Danny, uh, could
you wait outside

465
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:06,908
just for a couple of minutes?

466
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:09,667
- Why? Is... is everything OK? Is she...
- Oh, no.

467
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:13,470
Whatever you have to tell me,
you can say it in front of him.

468
00:21:13,572 --> 00:21:15,089
OK. Um...

469
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:19,660
Gretchen, you've...

470
00:21:19,762 --> 00:21:22,746
Um...

471
00:21:24,016 --> 00:21:27,251
Oh, OK. Gretchen, wh...

472
00:21:27,353 --> 00:21:30,821
Uh, what... what
happened is, um...

473
00:21:30,907 --> 00:21:32,456
The blockage in your lung

474
00:21:32,558 --> 00:21:34,542
was a condom.

475
00:21:35,694 --> 00:21:37,478
Apparently, you inhaled it.

476
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:39,580
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

477
00:21:39,682 --> 00:21:42,115
So the good news is
that we've removed it,

478
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:44,601
and you should be
feeling much better.

479
00:21:44,703 --> 00:21:46,187
- What?
- Danny, Danny...

480
00:21:46,289 --> 00:21:48,166
Wait a minute. I've...
I've... I've waited two years,

481
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:50,830
- and you been having sex
with someone else?
- No, no, no, no.

482
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:52,954
Plenty of people use
condoms to protect against

483
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:55,123
sexually transmitted
diseases when they're doing...

484
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:57,364
other sorts of things.

485
00:21:57,466 --> 00:21:59,082
We don't.

486
00:21:59,184 --> 00:22:02,002
Danny, please!
Danny, don't! Danny.

487
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:13,380
OK, you see how I'm
removing the tumor gently?

488
00:22:13,483 --> 00:22:14,748
Not really.

489
00:22:16,969 --> 00:22:18,986
OK, irrigate and suction.

490
00:22:20,873 --> 00:22:23,990
Good. Good. OK. Can you see now?

491
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:28,345
Yeah, I can.

492
00:22:28,447 --> 00:22:30,647
OK. You should be able
to see a little bit better now,

493
00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:33,400
because I'm gonna be doing...

494
00:22:33,502 --> 00:22:36,420
Oh, damn it. Oh, no.
It's bleeding too much.

495
00:22:36,522 --> 00:22:39,283
- The carotid?
- Could be. OK. Backing out now.

496
00:22:39,342 --> 00:22:41,492
OK, Dr. Yang, I need you to do

497
00:22:41,594 --> 00:22:44,428
- some nasal packing, please.
- Uh, no. Um, um, you can do it.

498
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:46,475
- It doesn't have to be pretty. Just pack it in there.
- No, I-I can't.

499
00:22:46,499 --> 00:22:49,277
- Yes, you can. Just do it.
- No, stop, stop. Please
stop it. I just...

500
00:22:49,301 --> 00:22:50,818
You do it.

501
00:22:53,522 --> 00:22:56,173
Pass me gelfoam and thrombin.

502
00:22:56,275 --> 00:22:57,674
Give me suction.

503
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:01,478
All right. We're gonna
have to open him up.

504
00:23:07,753 --> 00:23:09,152
What happened to you, Karev?

505
00:23:09,254 --> 00:23:12,406
Uh, patient wasn't
critical, so I took the stairs.

506
00:23:12,508 --> 00:23:14,458
Y-you do that all day?

507
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,393
Yeah. It's good exercise.
What's the big deal?

508
00:23:16,495 --> 00:23:18,473
Well, the big deal is,
you're... you're sweaty

509
00:23:18,497 --> 00:23:21,215
and you... and you smell.

510
00:23:21,317 --> 00:23:23,194
And you're not
going into my O.R.

511
00:23:23,218 --> 00:23:26,270
- What the hell's
the matter with you today?
- Nothing, I-I...

512
00:23:26,372 --> 00:23:29,173
Karev, you stink.
Now go take a shower.

513
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,713
Oh.

514
00:23:35,815 --> 00:23:38,243
- What?
- I thought I had
some normal skin here,

515
00:23:38,267 --> 00:23:41,185
- but it's already starting
to grow warts.
- What does that mean?

516
00:23:41,287 --> 00:23:43,704
It means, Jerry's not
going to get his skin grafts

517
00:23:43,806 --> 00:23:45,088
anytime soon.

518
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:47,541
He's gonna have a
lot of open wounds.

519
00:23:47,643 --> 00:23:49,393
So he was right.

520
00:23:49,495 --> 00:23:51,929
He is gonna look
like Frankenstein.

521
00:23:53,115 --> 00:23:55,198
Maybe I should
go update the wife.

522
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,417
You know, prepare
her for the worst?

523
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:59,186
I mean, if... if I
were her, I would...

524
00:23:59,288 --> 00:24:01,750
- I would want to know
sooner than later.
- You're not going anywhere.

525
00:24:01,774 --> 00:24:03,840
Which is fine, because
I'm... I'm fine right here.

526
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:06,894
I'm... I'm just saying, if... if,
you know, if I were the wife,

527
00:24:06,996 --> 00:24:10,981
I'd want to know
sooner than later.

528
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:14,168
Later it is, then.

529
00:24:20,575 --> 00:24:22,020
I need my mother's
engagement ring back.

530
00:24:22,044 --> 00:24:23,244
Can I have it, please?

531
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:26,546
Danny, please don't do this, OK?

532
00:24:26,648 --> 00:24:28,949
- If I could just...
- She didn't cheat on you.

533
00:24:29,051 --> 00:24:31,618
- Yeah?
- She didn't.

534
00:24:31,737 --> 00:24:33,932
She told us she has a
friend named Jeanette

535
00:24:33,956 --> 00:24:36,116
who threw her a
bachelorette party.

536
00:24:36,142 --> 00:24:38,620
- Yeah.
- Sometimes
at bachelorette parties,

537
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:41,445
there's a section of the party
known as the Tupperware segment,

538
00:24:41,547 --> 00:24:43,525
only it isn't really Tupperware.

539
00:24:43,549 --> 00:24:45,510
It's intimate items,
and there's someone

540
00:24:45,534 --> 00:24:48,001
who shows you how
to use all of these items.

541
00:24:48,103 --> 00:24:52,072
So the instructor was
instructing the attendees

542
00:24:52,174 --> 00:24:56,377
in techniques for, um,
applying a certain apparatus

543
00:24:56,479 --> 00:24:59,663
to something that
might s... simulate a...

544
00:24:59,765 --> 00:25:02,766
She put a condom on a
banana with her mouth

545
00:25:02,868 --> 00:25:05,452
and accidentally inhaled it.

546
00:25:07,089 --> 00:25:09,523
Gretchen?

547
00:25:09,625 --> 00:25:11,425
I choked, OK?

548
00:25:11,527 --> 00:25:14,845
And I thought
that I swallowed it.

549
00:25:17,883 --> 00:25:19,499
Obviously I have no
idea what I'm doing.

550
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:22,219
I just wanted you
to have a good time

551
00:25:22,321 --> 00:25:23,670
on our wedding night.

552
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:26,239
And will you please
stop laughing at me?

553
00:25:26,341 --> 00:25:29,710
I'm gonna love our
wedding night, OK?

554
00:25:29,812 --> 00:25:32,195
No matter what,
I'm gonna love it,

555
00:25:32,297 --> 00:25:34,681
because I love you.

556
00:25:39,238 --> 00:25:41,355
Stop it.

557
00:25:45,244 --> 00:25:46,677
You got it?

558
00:25:46,779 --> 00:25:47,779
Yep.

559
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,880
You sure? Because I can get it.

560
00:25:49,915 --> 00:25:51,965
You know, I do
this for a living.

561
00:25:52,067 --> 00:25:54,427
I know. I just want to
make sure you got it.

562
00:25:54,486 --> 00:25:56,954
Done. Wow.

563
00:25:57,056 --> 00:25:59,889
Would you look at that? I
have impressed even myself.

564
00:25:59,991 --> 00:26:02,726
So you're done. I can go?

565
00:26:02,828 --> 00:26:05,312
I am done.

566
00:26:09,702 --> 00:26:12,519
How did she get
past her internship?

567
00:26:12,621 --> 00:26:14,971
- Shut up.
- Derek, come on. She's a dud.

568
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:16,467
She wasn't ready,
and I pushed her.

569
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:18,036
Yeah, she wasn't ready
because she's a dud.

570
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:19,994
Cristina Yang saved my life.

571
00:26:20,096 --> 00:26:21,811
She saved my life.

572
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:23,396
I owe her everything.

573
00:26:23,498 --> 00:26:25,215
Get out.

574
00:26:26,719 --> 00:26:29,470
Get the hell out.

575
00:26:47,006 --> 00:26:48,105
12 pounds.

576
00:26:48,207 --> 00:26:50,207
EBay, here I come.

577
00:26:50,309 --> 00:26:51,786
- Dr. Grey.
- I'm sorry.

578
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:53,861
You are doctors.

579
00:26:53,963 --> 00:26:57,114
If you're going to be
doctors, caregivers,

580
00:26:57,216 --> 00:26:59,233
you need to be able
to handle anything

581
00:26:59,335 --> 00:27:02,185
the human body throws at you.

582
00:27:03,572 --> 00:27:05,004
Oh! Oh!

583
00:27:05,107 --> 00:27:06,556
Oh! Oh, God!

584
00:27:06,659 --> 00:27:09,676
Look right there. A spider.
It's a spider. Oh! J... no, no.

585
00:27:09,778 --> 00:27:11,506
Come on. Somebody do
something, please. It's a spider.

586
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:12,696
That?

587
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:15,031
Yes! It just crawled
right out of that horn.

588
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:16,861
- Quick, kill it! Kill it!
- I... it...

589
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,203
Thank you. Thank you.

590
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:22,506
Oh, thank you. Oh, thank you.

591
00:27:22,608 --> 00:27:25,876
Oh, thank you. OK. OK. Whew.

592
00:27:25,978 --> 00:27:29,046
<i>Dr. Hines to Labor and Delivery.</i>

593
00:27:29,148 --> 00:27:32,032
<i>Dr. Hines, Labor and Delivery.</i>

594
00:27:43,479 --> 00:27:45,279
I wouldn't have picked you...

595
00:27:45,381 --> 00:27:47,698
to be a part of my life.

596
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:51,051
Professionally? Sure,

597
00:27:51,153 --> 00:27:54,070
if you didn't think my
field was so uninteresting.

598
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:55,939
But personally?

599
00:27:56,041 --> 00:27:58,069
We wouldn't have
picked each other.

600
00:28:00,445 --> 00:28:04,148
But now we're family.

601
00:28:04,249 --> 00:28:07,817
And that means I
worry about you.

602
00:28:10,856 --> 00:28:13,273
You're flaming out.

603
00:28:15,344 --> 00:28:18,161
And as someone
who cares about you,

604
00:28:18,263 --> 00:28:19,546
it's not OK.

605
00:28:19,648 --> 00:28:22,532
As someone who's seen a
lot of residents come and go,

606
00:28:22,634 --> 00:28:27,054
but very, very few
with your potential...

607
00:28:27,156 --> 00:28:30,074
it is not OK.

608
00:28:35,914 --> 00:28:38,164
I can barely remember it...

609
00:28:38,266 --> 00:28:39,682
the whole procedure.

610
00:28:39,785 --> 00:28:40,967
I...

611
00:28:41,069 --> 00:28:43,419
I took a bullet
out of your chest,

612
00:28:43,521 --> 00:28:47,124
and... and all I can
remember are...

613
00:28:47,226 --> 00:28:48,591
bits and pieces,

614
00:28:48,693 --> 00:28:50,593
and the bits and
pieces I do remember,

615
00:28:50,695 --> 00:28:52,462
uh, come back at very
inconvenient times.

616
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:56,283
So, um, end of story, OK?

617
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:08,561
Karev.

618
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:10,964
Uh, y-yes, sir.

619
00:29:12,801 --> 00:29:15,735
You laid in a pool of your
own blood in that elevator

620
00:29:15,838 --> 00:29:17,204
and almost died.

621
00:29:17,306 --> 00:29:19,206
That's why you're
taking the stairs.

622
00:29:19,308 --> 00:29:21,708
Now someday you're
gonna have a critical patient,

623
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:24,744
and you won't be able
to run up the stairs.

624
00:29:24,847 --> 00:29:27,280
So... you and I...

625
00:29:27,382 --> 00:29:29,928
are gonna take that elevator...

626
00:29:29,952 --> 00:29:31,818
right now, together.

627
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:36,622
And you're gonna stay
on it until you're not scared.

628
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:42,695
You're just bored.

629
00:29:50,372 --> 00:29:53,340
We're gonna have to
do the surgery in stages.

630
00:29:53,442 --> 00:29:55,792
We may try stretching the skin.

631
00:29:55,894 --> 00:30:00,029
But right now, there's not
enough normal skin to cut from,

632
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:01,464
which means

633
00:30:01,566 --> 00:30:03,767
we may have to revisit
the idea of skin grafts later.

634
00:30:03,869 --> 00:30:05,435
How much later?

635
00:30:05,537 --> 00:30:09,389
That depends on how
much normal skin we find.

636
00:30:09,491 --> 00:30:11,736
About six months to a year.

637
00:30:15,397 --> 00:30:17,247
Still, in the meantime...

638
00:30:17,349 --> 00:30:20,434
he's still gonna
look like a freak?

639
00:30:20,536 --> 00:30:22,514
He'll look better than he did.

640
00:30:22,538 --> 00:30:25,823
But there will be
substantial scarring.

641
00:30:27,592 --> 00:30:29,793
So...

642
00:30:29,895 --> 00:30:31,795
I'm not even gonna
get a few months

643
00:30:31,897 --> 00:30:35,415
where he's gonna
look halfway normal,

644
00:30:35,517 --> 00:30:38,202
where he might want to go out,

645
00:30:38,304 --> 00:30:40,654
where he might want
to do something besides

646
00:30:40,756 --> 00:30:43,172
wall himself up in
our house all day?

647
00:30:43,274 --> 00:30:46,293
You're both just gonna
have to be patient.

648
00:30:46,395 --> 00:30:48,645
You met my husband, Dr. Sloan.

649
00:30:48,747 --> 00:30:52,382
You really think he can do that?

650
00:30:56,839 --> 00:31:01,041
I haven't touched
him in four years...

651
00:31:01,143 --> 00:31:02,909
haven't kissed him,

652
00:31:03,012 --> 00:31:05,245
haven't held his hand.

653
00:31:05,347 --> 00:31:07,213
He won't let me.

654
00:31:07,315 --> 00:31:10,483
I love him so much, but...

655
00:31:10,585 --> 00:31:14,788
I need to live a life, and
he wants to be a hermit.

656
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:18,358
And I think...

657
00:31:21,496 --> 00:31:23,163
love isn't enough anymore.

658
00:31:23,265 --> 00:31:26,416
Is that possible...

659
00:31:28,153 --> 00:31:30,086
that two people can
really love each other,

660
00:31:30,188 --> 00:31:34,440
and it just... isn't enough?

661
00:31:40,098 --> 00:31:42,132
Mr. Donaldson
had a heart attack,

662
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:44,567
so his arteries won't be
quite as clean as mine,

663
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:46,731
but you'll get the basic idea.

664
00:31:46,755 --> 00:31:49,856
- Now... you opened me up. Where did you make the incision?
- I don't know.

665
00:31:49,958 --> 00:31:51,208
Yes, you do.

666
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:53,354
Um, when I say
that I don't know,

667
00:31:53,378 --> 00:31:54,644
I'm not making it up.

668
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:56,924
I-I... literally, I
don't remember.

669
00:31:56,948 --> 00:31:59,549
OK. Well, fortunately,
I have some details.

670
00:32:02,353 --> 00:32:05,104
You started here
at the sternal notch

671
00:32:05,206 --> 00:32:07,674
and went south 6 inches.

672
00:32:14,215 --> 00:32:17,150
- OK, you know what? This is stupid.
- No, it isn't.

673
00:32:17,252 --> 00:32:19,172
What's the worst that
could happen, you kill him?

674
00:32:19,254 --> 00:32:21,371
Oh, ha ha, funny.

675
00:32:21,473 --> 00:32:23,757
Take the scalpel.

676
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:42,909
Median...

677
00:32:44,012 --> 00:32:45,995
sternotomy.

678
00:33:09,355 --> 00:33:11,455
Good.

679
00:33:11,556 --> 00:33:13,357
What happened next?

680
00:33:39,101 --> 00:33:41,301
Don't worry. I'm
leaving the premises.

681
00:33:41,403 --> 00:33:44,187
We were in the
back of the store.

682
00:33:44,289 --> 00:33:46,806
Dad had just given
you two pennies,

683
00:33:46,908 --> 00:33:49,142
and you always hid
them behind the counter

684
00:33:49,244 --> 00:33:51,628
in this big crack
in the floorboards.

685
00:33:53,065 --> 00:33:57,016
You said you were saving
them so you could buy a town.

686
00:33:57,118 --> 00:34:00,403
And then the two guys came in.

687
00:34:00,505 --> 00:34:01,855
We could hear them talking,

688
00:34:01,957 --> 00:34:03,917
but you weren't paying
attention until Dad yelled,

689
00:34:03,992 --> 00:34:05,358
and you looked up.

690
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,360
They had already pulled the gun,

691
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:09,996
they had already
taken the money,

692
00:34:10,098 --> 00:34:13,149
and now they wanted the
watch that Mom gave him.

693
00:34:17,589 --> 00:34:20,707
He wouldn't give it up.

694
00:34:20,809 --> 00:34:22,509
There was a gunshot.

695
00:34:22,611 --> 00:34:24,994
You... lunged forward.

696
00:34:25,096 --> 00:34:26,376
I remember.

697
00:34:26,431 --> 00:34:28,542
I was trying to get to him,

698
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:31,784
but... I couldn't move.

699
00:34:31,886 --> 00:34:33,836
That's because I was
holding you so tight

700
00:34:33,939 --> 00:34:36,506
that you couldn't budge.

701
00:34:44,149 --> 00:34:46,983
I put one hand over your
mouth so you wouldn't scream

702
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:49,118
and wrapped the
other one around you

703
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:51,060
and just held on for
dear life, prayed to God

704
00:34:51,156 --> 00:34:53,873
that you'd be quiet and
you wouldn't say anything.

705
00:34:53,975 --> 00:34:56,976
You were so little.

706
00:34:58,379 --> 00:35:01,347
I think that's what I've
always wanted all these years,

707
00:35:01,449 --> 00:35:03,850
is you just to stay...

708
00:35:03,952 --> 00:35:06,352
little and...

709
00:35:06,454 --> 00:35:09,556
quiet and safe.

710
00:35:09,658 --> 00:35:13,025
But you're not
any of those things.

711
00:35:13,127 --> 00:35:14,561
You're loud and fearless,

712
00:35:14,663 --> 00:35:16,963
and it scares the
crap out of me.

713
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:25,304
How am I supposed to call you up

714
00:35:25,407 --> 00:35:27,707
and tell you that
I've been shot?

715
00:35:30,044 --> 00:35:33,413
I can't tell you about my pain.

716
00:35:35,233 --> 00:35:38,651
I don't want you to
know that pain exists.

717
00:35:50,766 --> 00:35:52,933
Oh.

718
00:35:53,035 --> 00:35:55,802
I can't believe that you
keep brandy in your locker.

719
00:35:55,904 --> 00:35:57,954
- A patient gave it to me.
- Oh, yeah?

720
00:35:58,056 --> 00:36:00,501
You sneak in and take a swig
every time you see a spider?

721
00:36:00,525 --> 00:36:03,026
Every time I see a spider
crawl out of a human limb, yes.

722
00:36:03,111 --> 00:36:05,478
- And it is a phobia.
- Mm-hmm.

723
00:36:05,597 --> 00:36:07,208
OK? It is not... hey.
Give me back my bottle.

724
00:36:07,232 --> 00:36:08,442
Oh, no, no, no, Teddy needs it.

725
00:36:08,466 --> 00:36:10,750
- She's pathetic.
- That's right.

726
00:36:10,852 --> 00:36:12,630
- Mm-hmm.
- You finish it,
I'll hurt you.

727
00:36:12,654 --> 00:36:14,837
We're gonna live in a frat
house forever, aren't we?

728
00:36:14,939 --> 00:36:16,951
Hey, no. Meredith's
is a frat house.

729
00:36:16,975 --> 00:36:19,359
Our place is just that

730
00:36:19,461 --> 00:36:22,128
off-campus apartment where
the burnouts go to buy pot.

731
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:25,065
Did you tell him good-bye?

732
00:36:26,702 --> 00:36:29,152
I've kinda been avoiding him.

733
00:36:29,254 --> 00:36:31,754
I'm afraid if I see
him, I'll start to cry,

734
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:35,192
and then he'll think I'm
some kind of crazy stalker.

735
00:36:35,294 --> 00:36:37,310
Uh...

736
00:36:37,412 --> 00:36:41,147
Uh, let's go buy
Bailey a real drink.

737
00:36:41,249 --> 00:36:44,033
- Yeah.
- Yeah, let's go do that.

738
00:36:44,135 --> 00:36:45,785
Excuse us.

739
00:36:45,887 --> 00:36:47,787
- Hi.
- Hi.

740
00:36:49,657 --> 00:36:50,706
Hey.

741
00:36:50,808 --> 00:36:54,927
You gonna have dinner with me?

742
00:36:55,029 --> 00:36:57,947
Maybe we should just
settle for a peck on the cheek

743
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:01,034
and a wave good-bye
and keep it simple.

744
00:37:03,005 --> 00:37:05,571
Yeah, that sounds, uh,

745
00:37:05,674 --> 00:37:09,776
incredibly... dissatisfying.

746
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:18,268
I like you more
than I wanted to.

747
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:21,070
And, uh...

748
00:37:21,172 --> 00:37:24,207
and I knew what this was.

749
00:37:26,211 --> 00:37:29,779
I don't know what my problem is.

750
00:37:29,881 --> 00:37:32,426
Well, I've got a couple
of thoughts about that.

751
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:35,351
I thought I was the one person

752
00:37:35,453 --> 00:37:37,286
that you weren't gonna analyze.

753
00:37:37,388 --> 00:37:41,024
Well, I'm not entirely sure
it requires a professional.

754
00:37:41,109 --> 00:37:43,104
I mean, either I'm
wildly attractive,

755
00:37:43,128 --> 00:37:46,095
and your formidable
reason is no match for my...

756
00:37:46,197 --> 00:37:51,234
incredible magnetism.

757
00:37:51,336 --> 00:37:54,170
Or... you, uh,

758
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:56,839
fall for men who
aren't available...

759
00:37:56,942 --> 00:37:58,975
engaged...

760
00:37:59,077 --> 00:38:02,645
or only in town for a few weeks.

761
00:38:13,175 --> 00:38:16,209
You're making some
lousy choices, Altman.

762
00:38:16,311 --> 00:38:18,495
You deserve a little more.

763
00:38:21,733 --> 00:38:25,251
<i>Nobody chooses to be a freak.</i>

764
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:29,188
<i>Most people don't even
realize they're a freak</i>

765
00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:32,091
<i>until it's way too
late to change it.</i>

766
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:11,013
Come on. Just admit
it. You're still a virgin.

767
00:39:11,115 --> 00:39:13,182
- No, I'm not.
- Hey, there's no shame in it.

768
00:39:13,284 --> 00:39:14,950
- Really?
- No, there's shame.

769
00:39:15,052 --> 00:39:17,787
- A lot of shame. Tell her, Mer.
- I, um...

770
00:39:17,889 --> 00:39:19,489
I was gonna say something,

771
00:39:19,558 --> 00:39:22,225
and then I forgot
to stop drinking.

772
00:39:22,327 --> 00:39:24,010
Has anybody seen Cristina?

773
00:39:24,112 --> 00:39:26,712
OK. So today only one person
looked at me like a psycho

774
00:39:26,815 --> 00:39:28,848
who might run
down the hall naked,

775
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:31,985
and Dr. Bailey screamed
like a little bitch baby

776
00:39:32,087 --> 00:39:33,436
over a spider,

777
00:39:33,538 --> 00:39:35,700
so I'm feeling pretty good,
you know, for a crazy person.

778
00:39:35,724 --> 00:39:39,192
Well, nobody gives a crap if
you're crazy. We're all crazy.

779
00:39:39,294 --> 00:39:41,894
Yeah, look at April.
She's still a virgin.

780
00:39:41,997 --> 00:39:43,717
Yeah, well, Mark
gives a crap, OK?

781
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:45,064
He stares at me

782
00:39:45,166 --> 00:39:47,550
like I'm a menace to myself
and everyone around me.

783
00:39:47,652 --> 00:39:49,919
- Wait. You're still a virgin?
- Stop. OK?

784
00:39:50,021 --> 00:39:51,855
Just stop.

785
00:39:51,957 --> 00:39:53,857
I'm a virgin. Yes. So what?

786
00:39:53,959 --> 00:39:55,925
It's not something
I talk about, OK?

787
00:39:56,027 --> 00:39:57,994
We all have things
we don't talk about.

788
00:39:58,096 --> 00:39:59,941
Alex, you've been
afraid of the elevator

789
00:39:59,965 --> 00:40:03,433
for, like, a month, but
I never said anything

790
00:40:03,535 --> 00:40:05,351
because it's none
of my business.

791
00:40:05,453 --> 00:40:07,486
And, Jackson, you wake
up every night screaming

792
00:40:07,588 --> 00:40:09,773
because you have
nightmares. And, Meredith,

793
00:40:09,875 --> 00:40:12,308
you don't talk about
Cristina because you're afraid

794
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,910
she's never gonna be
the same Cristina again.

795
00:40:15,012 --> 00:40:17,113
And, Lexie... for God sake,

796
00:40:17,198 --> 00:40:20,366
Mark never thought you
were a psycho. He loves you.

797
00:40:20,468 --> 00:40:22,101
That's why he stares at you,

798
00:40:22,203 --> 00:40:24,247
because he can't keep his
eyes off the woman he loves.

799
00:40:24,271 --> 00:40:25,755
Of course, he's never

800
00:40:25,841 --> 00:40:27,417
gonna say anything 'cause
he doesn't feel like he can.

801
00:40:27,441 --> 00:40:29,708
Look, we all have
stuff we don't talk about.

802
00:40:29,810 --> 00:40:34,080
I am a 28-year-old
virgin, mainly because

803
00:40:34,182 --> 00:40:36,032
I wanted my first
time to be special,

804
00:40:36,134 --> 00:40:37,712
and then I waited too
long, and partially because

805
00:40:37,736 --> 00:40:39,702
I'm pretty sure guys
find me annoying.

806
00:40:39,805 --> 00:40:43,339
I'm a virgin. That doesn't
make it drinks conversation.

807
00:40:43,442 --> 00:40:46,643
We all have stuff
we don't talk about.

808
00:40:51,733 --> 00:40:55,168
Oh, April. I'm liking
you more and more.

809
00:40:55,270 --> 00:40:58,288
Thank you.

810
00:41:04,863 --> 00:41:06,779
You're not on call tonight?

811
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:09,098
No. No, I'm home all night.

812
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,249
Good.

813
00:41:11,685 --> 00:41:14,921
Come here.

814
00:41:15,023 --> 00:41:17,523
How was your day?

815
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:21,493
I think...

816
00:41:22,797 --> 00:41:26,032
I could be happy
being a plumber.

817
00:41:29,371 --> 00:41:31,554
Mm. Mm. Mm.

818
00:41:34,675 --> 00:41:36,776
- I...
- Whoa.

819
00:41:36,878 --> 00:41:38,311
Mm.

820
00:41:40,065 --> 00:41:41,458
- Aah!
- Whoa!

821
00:41:46,387 --> 00:41:48,465
- We have to get
our own place.
- Yeah.

822
00:41:48,489 --> 00:41:51,840
<i>But no matter how much of
a freak you end up being...</i>

823
00:41:53,461 --> 00:41:58,697
<i>chances are, there's still
someone out there for you.</i>

824
00:42:02,053 --> 00:42:04,337
<i>Unless, of course,
they've already moved on...</i>

825
00:42:04,439 --> 00:42:07,140
So what time do you
have to be at the airport?

826
00:42:07,242 --> 00:42:09,269
Not for another couple of hours.

827
00:42:09,293 --> 00:42:10,404
- Mm.
- Mm.

828
00:42:10,428 --> 00:42:12,461
<i>Because when it comes to love...</i>

829
00:42:13,865 --> 00:42:16,298
<i>even freaks can't wait forever.</i>
