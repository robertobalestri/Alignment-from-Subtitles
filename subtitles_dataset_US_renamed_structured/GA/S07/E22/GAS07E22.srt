1
00:00:07,375 --> 00:00:10,609
<i>I always said I'd
be happier alone.</i>

2
00:00:10,711 --> 00:00:13,078
<i>I'd have my work, my friends.</i>

3
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:17,416
<i>But someone in
your life all the time?</i>

4
00:00:17,518 --> 00:00:21,136
<i>- More trouble than it's worth.</i>
<i>- </i> OK. Crib goes here.

5
00:00:21,238 --> 00:00:22,838
<i>Apparently, I got over it.</i>

6
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:27,709
Changing table
will go... right here.

7
00:00:29,563 --> 00:00:32,831
But you can't plan a baby
room before you have a baby.

8
00:00:32,933 --> 00:00:34,544
I mean, you're gonna
jinx the adoption.

9
00:00:34,568 --> 00:00:37,408
The social worker wants to see
where we live. This is like a death-trap.

10
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:39,354
I'm trying to create a
reasonable distraction.

11
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:42,774
- Hello?
- Janet! Welcome!

12
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:47,579
How are you? Thanks for coming
out. Oh, be careful. Watch those nails.

13
00:00:55,488 --> 00:00:57,639
Perfect for a baby, right?

14
00:00:59,176 --> 00:01:00,308
Hm...

15
00:01:06,067 --> 00:01:09,147
I'm gonna stop in the lab. I'll
see you after the intake, OK?

16
00:01:09,203 --> 00:01:12,220
OK. Oh, God. I forgot it
was the Hobarts today.

17
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:15,957
It always bums me out when we have
an Alzheimer's patient with young kids.

18
00:01:16,059 --> 00:01:17,820
There's no shame in sitting
this one out. I can do the intake.

19
00:01:17,844 --> 00:01:20,646
Stop treating me like I'm your
wife. On the trial, I'm a colleague.

20
00:01:20,748 --> 00:01:23,526
I'm allowed to say, "It bums me out."
It doesn't mean you have to feed me

21
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:25,895
warm milk and run a
bath. Treat me like a doctor.

22
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:29,187
Right. Sorry. OK. Go
do the intake, colleague.

23
00:01:30,691 --> 00:01:34,209
Shepherd, you got a minute? I
need to talk to you about your trial.

24
00:01:34,311 --> 00:01:35,877
Oh, um...

25
00:01:35,979 --> 00:01:37,790
I should get Meredith.
I just got a lecture on

26
00:01:37,814 --> 00:01:40,610
the failure to extend professional
courtesy to one's spouse.

27
00:01:40,634 --> 00:01:43,868
I think it's best you
don't get Meredith.

28
00:01:47,174 --> 00:01:51,643
You're in, in very good hands. I still
feel bad that I'm not gonna be here.

29
00:01:51,745 --> 00:01:55,980
For the surgery? I'll be unconscious,
that's not when I'm gonna miss you.

30
00:01:57,167 --> 00:01:59,434
- OK. Then I guess I won't...
- You can feel bad

31
00:01:59,537 --> 00:02:01,003
about all the time that follows.

32
00:02:01,105 --> 00:02:04,790
When I'm not under general
anesthesia, and you're still not here,

33
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:08,527
you're halfway around
the world... with Arnold.

34
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:11,029
- Andrew.
- Ah...

35
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:13,699
- Excuse me?
- He's a rock star.

36
00:02:13,801 --> 00:02:16,513
I kind of feel like the sound of an
adoring crowd should follow his name.

37
00:02:16,537 --> 00:02:19,938
I don't... Is that a
compliment or an insult?

38
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,518
I don't know, I guess it depends
on how you feel about rock stars.

39
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:24,688
- OK, well,
Andrew's not a rock star...
- Ah...

40
00:02:24,712 --> 00:02:26,990
OK, you know what? Can you stop
that? It's starting to get annoying.

41
00:02:27,014 --> 00:02:30,232
My wife's leaving, I'm
allowed to be annoying.

42
00:02:33,837 --> 00:02:37,517
I'm not a real wife, so that
doesn't buy for a lot of bad behavior.

43
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:39,791
Well, you're my real best
friend, what does that get me?

44
00:02:40,811 --> 00:02:44,195
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be. Go be happy.

45
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:46,181
With Andrew. Ah...

46
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,834
You're impossible.

47
00:02:54,908 --> 00:02:56,975
Yeah. You, too.

48
00:02:58,228 --> 00:03:02,397
Meredith, tell me
exactly what you did.

49
00:03:02,499 --> 00:03:04,982
- I can't tell you.
- We can still fix this,

50
00:03:05,085 --> 00:03:07,330
- but I need to know
what you did.
- If I tell you,

51
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:10,188
- it'll make it worse.
- It's worse already. Meredith...

52
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:12,690
Listen, I... I love you.

53
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:17,195
And I'm sorry, but I
can't tell you anything.

54
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:24,786
You want to be treated like a colleague?
I'm gonna treat you like a colleague.

55
00:03:24,888 --> 00:03:29,791
Alex Karev informed Dr. Hunt that
Dr. Grey tampered with my clinical trial.

56
00:03:29,893 --> 00:03:32,828
She switched around the
placebos and the drugs,

57
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:36,031
probably invalidating my trial.

58
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,485
- Is this true?
- Nothing
I did has any effect...

59
00:03:40,587 --> 00:03:42,704
- Tell me exactly what happened.
- I can't do that.

60
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:45,523
Do you have any idea what
you've done? You think the FDA

61
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:47,942
will get anywhere near
this hospital ever again?

62
00:03:48,044 --> 00:03:50,078
Meredith, look at me.

63
00:03:52,415 --> 00:03:55,267
If this is wrong, if there
is something going on,

64
00:03:55,369 --> 00:03:59,804
if Karev is exaggerating, this is
the part where you have to tell me.

65
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:02,840
This is the part where you
have to deny the charges.

66
00:04:02,926 --> 00:04:05,360
Kick me off the study.

67
00:04:05,462 --> 00:04:08,964
There's nothing
wrong with the study.

68
00:04:09,066 --> 00:04:13,268
- Nothing I did
changes anything.
- But you're not denying it.

69
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:19,190
I'm gonna have to investigate
what's going on here,

70
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:22,627
but it looks to me like
you just lost your job.

71
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:34,085
So they're probably gonna
fire me. Are you happy?

72
00:04:34,141 --> 00:04:36,119
- Come on, they're not gonna...
- I want your crap

73
00:04:36,143 --> 00:04:38,343
out of my house by
the end of the day.

74
00:04:39,897 --> 00:04:44,465
What the hell was that?

75
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:48,619
A 757 went down in the Sound.

76
00:04:48,721 --> 00:04:51,473
We're looking at about
200 injured passengers.

77
00:04:51,575 --> 00:04:54,876
We're the designated crisis center.
Families will be instructed to come here

78
00:04:54,978 --> 00:04:58,730
to find their loved ones. We
are activating Surge Protocol.

79
00:04:58,832 --> 00:05:01,850
Dr. Hunt is gonna be running
the show. It's gonna be chaotic.

80
00:05:01,952 --> 00:05:05,002
You need to listen carefully,
you need to stay focused,

81
00:05:05,104 --> 00:05:07,272
do not contribute to the panic.

82
00:05:07,374 --> 00:05:09,140
Get to your stations.

83
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:12,177
Dr. Bailey, clear
any beds that we can.

84
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:14,946
- Discharge or transfer.
- OK. Uh, Grey.

85
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:19,434
All right, Torres, you'll be with
me. Kepner, set up the ER for triage.

86
00:05:19,536 --> 00:05:21,046
Other Grey, I want you
running the family center.

87
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,588
Take over in the
cafeteria. Yang, blood bank.

88
00:05:23,691 --> 00:05:26,124
- We might need a Candyman.
- Dr. Sloan'll be our Candyman.

89
00:05:26,226 --> 00:05:28,021
Let's be liberal with
pain meds for our victims

90
00:05:28,045 --> 00:05:32,180
and sedatives for patients that we're
moving. Avery, you can help him out.

91
00:05:32,282 --> 00:05:35,200
- Let's move, people!
- What happened with Meredith?

92
00:05:35,302 --> 00:05:37,218
- Cristina, I can't...
- Owen!

93
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:41,222
She tampered with Shepherd's
study, invalidated the results.

94
00:05:41,324 --> 00:05:42,607
She destroyed the whole thing.

95
00:05:48,832 --> 00:05:51,177
There was a plane crash. They're
gonna cancel your procedure

96
00:05:51,201 --> 00:05:54,163
and try to send you home. You
need to tell them that you're a D-1.

97
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:57,472
You don't need to be in pre-op, but
you want to be moved to a regular room.

98
00:05:57,574 --> 00:06:00,241
That way, when the hospital
starts doing surgery again,

99
00:06:00,344 --> 00:06:03,060
- you'll be first in the queue.
- Don't you have a plane...?

100
00:06:03,162 --> 00:06:06,498
- Wait, did they
shut down the airport?
- No, but we're not leaving

101
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,518
till it's over. They need
surgeons and trauma counselors.

102
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,020
These are your films.

103
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:14,522
They're gonna schedule your
surgery at Seattle Presbyterian.

104
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:15,802
Seattle Pres can't take anymore,

105
00:06:15,826 --> 00:06:17,808
- start calling County!
- Avery!

106
00:06:17,894 --> 00:06:20,411
Why'd you give me that guy in
the middle of a mass trauma?

107
00:06:20,497 --> 00:06:22,525
- Avery?
- - The kid quit Webber's study.

108
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:25,189
What kind of idiot decides
working with the chief of surgery's

109
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,484
too taxing on his schedule?

110
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:28,786
He didn't quit 'cause he
thinks it's too much hard work.

111
00:06:28,856 --> 00:06:31,706
He quit because he thinks the
chief has a shot at a Harper Avery.

112
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:36,077
He was worried that if his name was
on it, it would kill Webber's chances.

113
00:06:38,015 --> 00:06:40,982
- Kepner! Discharges.
- Yep.

114
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:50,075
You know, she's the only one
who ever gave a rat's ass about you.

115
00:06:50,177 --> 00:06:52,727
And now you might
have destroyed her career.

116
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:54,640
You should find some
skanky intern to love you,

117
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:56,342
'cause next time you're
in a burning building,

118
00:06:56,366 --> 00:06:58,399
no one is handing
you a glass of water.

119
00:06:59,769 --> 00:07:01,481
Please make sure you give
us a cell phone number...

120
00:07:01,505 --> 00:07:04,689
- Matthew Ruiz? Do you...?
- No one
from the flight has arrived.

121
00:07:04,792 --> 00:07:06,419
- As soon as we get...
- - Do you have a list of people

122
00:07:06,443 --> 00:07:08,587
- they're bringing to the hospital?
- - It can take

123
00:07:08,611 --> 00:07:12,314
Emergency Services quite a long time to move
and identify people in a situation like this.

124
00:07:12,415 --> 00:07:15,633
- Just try to be patient.
- I'm sorry,
my wife was on the plane.

125
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:17,730
- Can you please just...?
- Sir, at this point we don't

126
00:07:17,754 --> 00:07:19,699
have any information.
Please, just sign the sheets.

127
00:07:19,723 --> 00:07:22,919
I'd like to speak to your supervisor,
somebody that knows what's going on.

128
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:26,511
Ma'am, my supervisor doesn't have any
information. Nobody has any information.

129
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:29,731
Please, just sign the sheet.

130
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:34,719
Dr. Hunt! I had way too many
drinks before I told you that.

131
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:36,732
- I didn't mean for...
- Not now, Karev.

132
00:07:36,756 --> 00:07:39,435
Look, I told you that because I didn't
think she should be chief resident,

133
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,804
- not that she should be fired.
- If you didn't
think this through,

134
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:44,061
then you're as dumb as she is.

135
00:07:54,691 --> 00:07:57,258
Hey. You OK?

136
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,694
Yeah, I'm fine. Uh...

137
00:07:59,796 --> 00:08:05,666
The plane was from Baltimore,
where my parents live.

138
00:08:05,769 --> 00:08:08,853
I've taken that flight, uh...

139
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:10,822
with my son.

140
00:08:12,476 --> 00:08:14,316
You want to come sit
down with me for a minute?

141
00:08:16,012 --> 00:08:20,398
No, no, no. I can't, uh,
there's too much, uh...

142
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,683
OK. Um...

143
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:28,156
I'm just gonna stand
here for a minute.

144
00:08:28,258 --> 00:08:29,624
Is that all right?

145
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:38,744
<i>- Are you on any medications?
- - No.</i>

146
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:41,620
- Ever given blood before?
- Nope.

147
00:08:41,722 --> 00:08:45,373
- Any chance you're pregnant?
- Mm...

148
00:08:45,475 --> 00:08:47,275
- I don't know.
- When was your last period?

149
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,911
I'm not sure.

150
00:08:50,013 --> 00:08:54,682
Uh, what were you doing, um, last
time you had to deal with tampons?

151
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:58,653
Like, maybe it was
St. Patrick's Day,

152
00:08:58,755 --> 00:09:01,689
and you ate, uh, four
green donuts and thought,

153
00:09:01,792 --> 00:09:03,602
"Wow, that's disgusting,
I must be hormonal."

154
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:05,610
Oh, my gosh, you're right!

155
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:09,113
Except it was these gross
cookies with green frosting.

156
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:14,019
But that was a while ago. Uh, I
guess I had mine again around Easter,

157
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:17,855
'cause I was all over the
Marshmallow Peeps. It totally works!

158
00:09:20,928 --> 00:09:24,078
Hey! What the hell?!

159
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:32,036
It looks about six weeks to me.

160
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:35,072
Ahem. I take it this
wasn't deliberate.

161
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:39,527
- No.
- OK.

162
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:42,613
You want to talk about options?

163
00:09:43,817 --> 00:09:45,583
No.

164
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:50,405
<i>Officials say it's too
early to speculate</i>

165
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:53,725
<i>on the cause of the crash.
But here's what we do know.</i>

166
00:09:53,827 --> 00:09:59,347
<i>The flight originated this morning in
Baltimore carrying 183 passengers</i>

167
00:09:59,449 --> 00:10:02,116
<i>- and 18 crew members...</i>
- Still nobody?

168
00:10:02,218 --> 00:10:05,503
The families are going
crazy. What is taking so long?

169
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:08,222
Fishing 200 people out of
the water is slow business.

170
00:10:08,324 --> 00:10:09,991
You want to play Angry Birds?

171
00:10:10,093 --> 00:10:12,777
They'll do triage at the
waterfront. Takes time.

172
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:15,774
Actually, with it taking this long,
there's gonna be a lot of hypothermia.

173
00:10:15,798 --> 00:10:18,266
- Kepner!
- Yeah. Warm blankets,
heated lamps

174
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:20,779
- and heated IV fluids. Got it.
- You post chief resident yet?

175
00:10:20,803 --> 00:10:23,855
- No. Not yet.
- What's the hold up?

176
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:26,674
The suspense ain't killing
me. It's gonna be Grey.

177
00:10:26,776 --> 00:10:29,694
Karev made a great play
for it. A plane full of orphans?

178
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:31,924
- That's pretty impressive.
- He's already decided,

179
00:10:31,948 --> 00:10:35,750
- you don't have to lobby for your boy.
- - Karev.

180
00:10:35,852 --> 00:10:38,714
I want a written account of
exactly what you saw. Every detail.

181
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:40,149
- When, where...
- Sir, I don't think...

182
00:10:40,173 --> 00:10:43,458
I don't want to
know what you think.

183
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:47,428
I need more sedatives. The people we're
transferring are starting to freak out.

184
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:57,956
You're a good man, Avery.

185
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:04,863
Lexie's yours. Take
her. Take care of her.

186
00:11:06,316 --> 00:11:07,449
I'll stay out of your way.

187
00:11:07,551 --> 00:11:09,991
I kind of already
have her, but...

188
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:14,322
- thank you?
- You're welcome.

189
00:11:16,743 --> 00:11:18,059
I need to talk to you.

190
00:11:22,766 --> 00:11:25,110
You know, I think I'm gonna order
pizza. If you want I can get the...

191
00:11:25,134 --> 00:11:26,701
I'm pregnant.

192
00:11:33,093 --> 00:11:36,010
- Cristina.
- I cannot believe
this is happening.

193
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:38,813
I know.

194
00:11:38,915 --> 00:11:42,784
I know it's complicated. I know it
wasn't supposed to happen like this,

195
00:11:42,886 --> 00:11:47,021
but... Cristina, this
could be something...

196
00:11:47,124 --> 00:11:48,723
What? No.

197
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:52,305
There is no way we're
doing this. Do you hear me?

198
00:11:52,329 --> 00:11:56,464
- Cristina...
- No, I am not
this beautiful vessel

199
00:11:56,566 --> 00:11:58,800
for all that might be
good about the future.

200
00:11:58,902 --> 00:12:00,952
I am not carrying your
hopes and dreams, no!

201
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:03,404
I get to talk! I'm here!
There's two of us.

202
00:12:03,506 --> 00:12:08,843
We are a partnership. Can we
just think together? Is that OK?

203
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:17,045
I know who you are. I know
what you want. I love you.

204
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:22,273
I don't love the incubating
potential of your womb, I love you.

205
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:25,827
Why would I want to do something
that would make you miserable?

206
00:12:25,929 --> 00:12:29,680
You think I love you more when you're
miserable? Do you think I want that?

207
00:12:29,783 --> 00:12:33,084
You running off to Meredith? You
think I'm looking for more of that?

208
00:12:35,021 --> 00:12:38,740
- But... I think
there's a way...
- No! No!

209
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:41,142
I still get to talk. There is
a way to make this work

210
00:12:41,244 --> 00:12:45,212
without it ruining your life
or derailing your career.

211
00:12:45,314 --> 00:12:46,864
I don't want a baby.

212
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:49,100
Well, you have one.

213
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:52,437
Are...

214
00:12:52,539 --> 00:12:57,842
- Are you getting
all lifey on me?
- How late are you?

215
00:12:57,944 --> 00:13:01,446
- That does not matter!
- Of course it matters.

216
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:04,360
OK, fine. You tell me when life begins.
You know, I can't wait to hear this one.

217
00:13:04,384 --> 00:13:08,552
I don't know. Does
it have hands?

218
00:13:08,655 --> 00:13:12,273
- I cannot believe
you're doing this!
- I'm just asking a question.

219
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:16,710
I don't want one.

220
00:13:16,812 --> 00:13:19,713
I don't hate children.
I respect children.

221
00:13:19,815 --> 00:13:22,150
I think they should have
parents who want them.

222
00:13:22,252 --> 00:13:23,551
I want them.

223
00:13:24,754 --> 00:13:26,498
I want them, and
maybe you could, too.

224
00:13:26,522 --> 00:13:31,492
I believe... your life can
be bigger than you think it is.

225
00:13:31,595 --> 00:13:34,829
I know you can contain
more than you think you can.

226
00:13:34,931 --> 00:13:38,749
I'm not saying we do this.
I'm just saying let's think.

227
00:13:38,852 --> 00:13:41,152
Let's see what kind
of life we can imagine.

228
00:13:43,022 --> 00:13:45,423
Cristina Yang...

229
00:13:45,525 --> 00:13:49,477
I imagine such
a huge life for us.

230
00:13:57,204 --> 00:14:00,038
This is an extremely
serious accusation, Meredith.

231
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:04,459
- Can't you tell me anything?
- I can't, I'm sorry.

232
00:14:04,561 --> 00:14:06,510
Talk to me.

233
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:08,579
How many patients are
we talking about here?

234
00:14:08,682 --> 00:14:12,216
- Did this happen
more than once?
- I can't say that either.

235
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:15,820
- She can't say anything.
- We're gonna
unwind this, Meredith.

236
00:14:15,922 --> 00:14:19,440
Karev is figuring out what cases
he was on when he saw you.

237
00:14:19,542 --> 00:14:21,670
He'll narrow down the dates,
we know which patients...

238
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:24,478
Nothing I did changed the trial.

239
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:28,199
- Fire me,
do whatever you have...
- You don't get to choose, OK?

240
00:14:32,088 --> 00:14:35,289
You don't get to decide who
gets the drug or the placebo.

241
00:14:35,391 --> 00:14:38,275
You don't get to decide
what information the trial gets.

242
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:43,397
Anything I tell you affects the
trial. If you don't know what I did,

243
00:14:43,499 --> 00:14:46,033
- the trial stays blind.
- The trial is over.

244
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:50,003
You screwed me, you screwed this
hospital and you screwed yourself.

245
00:14:50,105 --> 00:14:52,039
This is your disease
we're trying to cure.

246
00:14:52,142 --> 00:14:54,926
- I could have
picked Parkinson's...
- It was Adele.

247
00:14:55,028 --> 00:14:59,246
- But I I did this for you.
- Derek. It was Adele.

248
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:13,795
Uh, maybe I should put some IV
fluids in the heater? Warm them up?

249
00:15:13,897 --> 00:15:16,125
- No.
- But if people
have been in the water

250
00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:17,426
- for that long, they'll be...
- April.

251
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:18,465
But if we just...

252
00:15:18,568 --> 00:15:20,168
No one's coming.

253
00:15:21,404 --> 00:15:25,239
If it's taking this
long, nobody survived.

254
00:15:35,368 --> 00:15:37,435
What are you gonna do?

255
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:41,088
- I don't know.
- The protocol is fairly clear.

256
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:43,385
Are you encouraging
him to fire me?

257
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:47,979
Derek, I basically pressured her
to do it. You'd have to fire us both.

258
00:15:57,089 --> 00:16:00,308
I'm gonna have to suspend
you, so it doesn't look so bad.

259
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:05,312
The study... I need to turn the
whole mess over to the FDA,

260
00:16:05,415 --> 00:16:07,782
let them figure out what
to do with it. I can't...

261
00:16:16,792 --> 00:16:21,012
- Meredith, I don't
know how to...
- I know.

262
00:16:28,838 --> 00:16:31,889
Emergency Services has
begun identifying bodies.

263
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,491
They've given us a list.

264
00:16:33,593 --> 00:16:37,028
The airline reps are on their
way, we've got social workers here,

265
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:42,316
and more coming. It's a long list.
Each of you have families to inform.

266
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:45,752
So, uh, please be outside the
cafeteria in exactly one hour.

267
00:16:45,854 --> 00:16:49,223
You'll call one family at a time,
and you'll be assigned a room

268
00:16:49,325 --> 00:16:53,794
to take them to and deliver the
news. It's gonna be a long day.

269
00:16:54,647 --> 00:16:55,997
That's it.

270
00:17:15,685 --> 00:17:18,219
Dr. Hunt, you gave
chief resident to Kepner?

271
00:17:18,321 --> 00:17:21,388
It was supposed to be me or Grey! You
think anyone's gonna listen to Kepner?

272
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:23,635
- It's gonna be complete chaos.
- Think anyone's
gonna listen to you?

273
00:17:23,659 --> 00:17:26,588
You just sold out the one universally
liked individual at this hospital.

274
00:17:26,612 --> 00:17:30,147
Everyone is gonna hate you. Chief
resident's supposed to manage peers,

275
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,583
be a resource and
support. After what you did,

276
00:17:32,685 --> 00:17:35,125
do you think anyone is gonna
come to you for anything?

277
00:17:36,038 --> 00:17:39,874
I was planning to give
it to you. But now...

278
00:17:42,461 --> 00:17:46,414
So it's possible that it
won't ever... That we just...

279
00:17:46,516 --> 00:17:49,983
- we just won't
get the treatment?
- It's a possibility. Yes.

280
00:17:50,085 --> 00:17:52,603
Oh, my God. This isn't right.

281
00:17:52,705 --> 00:17:55,889
We're so close. He
needs this! Can you just...?

282
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:58,059
- Is it killing people?
- No.

283
00:17:58,177 --> 00:18:00,962
- So give it to him anyway!
- I wish we could.

284
00:18:01,064 --> 00:18:05,266
No, don't give me that! You
can, and you're choosing not to!

285
00:18:05,368 --> 00:18:06,562
- Audrey.
- No!

286
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:08,297
They say there's
nothing they can do?

287
00:18:08,321 --> 00:18:13,157
There's a drug in a box in this
hospital. You were on the schedule!

288
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:17,545
My children's father is
disappearing! Give him the damn drug!

289
00:18:23,136 --> 00:18:26,303
I could take a leave
for six months or a year.

290
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:28,183
- No, you couldn't.
- Sure, I could.

291
00:18:28,207 --> 00:18:29,351
They're not gonna fire me.

292
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:31,642
- No!
- Stop saying no!

293
00:18:31,744 --> 00:18:34,145
I'm telling you, I
want this, I can do this.

294
00:18:34,247 --> 00:18:37,981
This does not have to be your
problem. It'll be my problem.

295
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:41,585
- You wouldn't even...
- What, notice?

296
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:46,073
It'll be a baby! I'm not a monster.
If I have a baby, I'll... I'll love it!

297
00:18:47,092 --> 00:18:49,826
That's the problem.

298
00:18:49,928 --> 00:18:54,331
That you'll love it. That's a
problem that we can work with.

299
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:56,845
- I'm sorry, are you
laughing right now?
- No. No, I'm just...

300
00:18:56,869 --> 00:18:58,109
I'm not. I just...

301
00:18:59,288 --> 00:19:01,655
- I love you.
- What is so...?

302
00:19:01,757 --> 00:19:04,024
- Are you even listening to me?
- Yes.

303
00:19:04,126 --> 00:19:06,794
I'm just trying to figure out
some kind of a compromise.

304
00:19:06,896 --> 00:19:08,996
You know what?
There is no compromise.

305
00:19:09,098 --> 00:19:13,500
You don't have half a
baby! I don't want one!

306
00:19:13,602 --> 00:19:17,071
OK, it isn't about work, this
isn't a scheduling conflict.

307
00:19:17,173 --> 00:19:20,691
- I don't wanna be a mother!
- Cristina, do you love me?

308
00:19:20,793 --> 00:19:23,694
- Of course I do.
- Do you trust me?

309
00:19:23,796 --> 00:19:27,798
- I... Yes!
- You'd be a great mother.

310
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:31,535
You would. I know you
don't believe me, but it is true.

311
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:34,472
Just sit with this
for a little while,

312
00:19:34,574 --> 00:19:37,892
this terrible idea that
you might love a baby.

313
00:19:37,994 --> 00:19:39,577
Just, for me, sit with it.

314
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,213
Did you even hear...?
OK. Why would I do that?

315
00:19:42,315 --> 00:19:45,182
Because you love
me. You love me.

316
00:19:46,151 --> 00:19:47,784
That's why.

317
00:19:50,456 --> 00:19:54,258
I have three names. I don't
think I can do this three times.

318
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:58,796
One foot in front of the other. I've
got something that'll cheer you up.

319
00:19:58,898 --> 00:20:01,615
Sloan gave us his blessing.
Well, that's not really right,

320
00:20:01,717 --> 00:20:07,170
more like he gave you
to me, which was nice.

321
00:20:07,273 --> 00:20:11,709
- Are you serious?
- Yep. I probably
owe him a goat.

322
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:17,264
- OK.
- All right. Let's do it.

323
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:30,678
Is the Schoman family
here? Jessica and Maxwell?

324
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:33,196
Jason Schoman, he's our son.

325
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:35,916
I'm Dr. Altman. Will
you follow me, please?

326
00:20:36,018 --> 00:20:38,435
They think it's good news.

327
00:20:39,022 --> 00:20:40,254
Elaine Chen.

328
00:20:40,356 --> 00:20:43,941
Ma'am, I'm Dr. Sloan. Why
don't you come with me.

329
00:20:44,043 --> 00:20:48,546
- Gilda and Miguel Ruiz?
- This is a nightmare.

330
00:20:48,648 --> 00:20:52,349
Hi, I'm Dr. Bailey.
Come with me, please.

331
00:20:52,452 --> 00:20:54,301
I can't wait to see her face.

332
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:10,384
Hey. I brought some pudding.

333
00:21:11,554 --> 00:21:14,288
That's why you're here?

334
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:16,084
I've got a good nurse, she'll
hook me up with pudding.

335
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,192
I know. It's just...

336
00:21:18,293 --> 00:21:21,778
I just spent the last two hours telling
people their family members were dead.

337
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,264
And I needed to... I
just wanted to say hi.

338
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:27,718
Or bye. Again. I don't know...

339
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:29,547
I really tried to be a
gentleman about all this.

340
00:21:29,571 --> 00:21:32,189
But now you need
to get the hell out.

341
00:21:33,526 --> 00:21:35,406
- What are you doing?
- Letting you go

342
00:21:35,494 --> 00:21:37,060
was the worst
thing I've ever done.

343
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:39,463
It's the most painful
thing I've ever done,

344
00:21:39,565 --> 00:21:42,349
and I'm a guy who's
had 82 surgeries.

345
00:21:42,451 --> 00:21:46,686
My threshold for pain is
pretty high. You need to get out!

346
00:21:46,789 --> 00:21:50,357
I'm not your best bud. I'm
not your security blanket.

347
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:52,376
I'm a man who's
in love with you,

348
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:55,262
who waltzed you into the arms
of a damn knight on a horse.

349
00:21:55,364 --> 00:21:59,583
So go to Germany, and have
little spaetzle-eating children,

350
00:21:59,685 --> 00:22:04,238
and please, for God's
sakes, leave me alone.

351
00:22:15,718 --> 00:22:20,120
Cafeteria is pandemonium.
Wailing people everywhere.

352
00:22:20,222 --> 00:22:21,655
You admitting anyone?

353
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:25,425
We're signing in a few so
we can give 'em sedatives.

354
00:22:25,527 --> 00:22:27,394
That's about it.

355
00:22:32,151 --> 00:22:33,431
ER.

356
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:36,953
There's a survivor.

357
00:22:39,292 --> 00:22:41,258
- You leaving?
- No. I didn't get fired.

358
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,055
I know that's
disappointing to you.

359
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:45,079
My trial is about to disappear.

360
00:22:45,181 --> 00:22:46,709
You really want to act
like I'm the bad guy here?

361
00:22:46,733 --> 00:22:49,533
- No, I don't.
- I know the fact
that it is Adele

362
00:22:49,635 --> 00:22:51,429
changes things for
Richard, but it doesn't for me.

363
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:54,365
- Oh, I understand that.
- You couldn't possibly
understand that.

364
00:22:54,389 --> 00:22:57,591
If you were focused on the
millions of people with Alzheimer's

365
00:22:57,693 --> 00:23:00,172
whose lives could've been different,
would've been better because of this drug,

366
00:23:00,196 --> 00:23:02,316
there's no way in hell you
would've pulled this stunt.

367
00:23:05,184 --> 00:23:08,685
How is it that you don't know the
difference between right and wrong?

368
00:23:08,787 --> 00:23:12,540
Because I don't think that
things are simply right or wrong.

369
00:23:12,658 --> 00:23:16,443
Things are more complicated than
that. This was more complicated than that.

370
00:23:16,545 --> 00:23:19,797
It's complicated that it
was Adele and Richard.

371
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:26,369
It's complicated that we have a
drug in a box that could help her.

372
00:23:26,472 --> 00:23:28,832
There's nothing
simple about that.

373
00:23:28,891 --> 00:23:32,292
I am very sorry that I
messed everything up.

374
00:23:32,394 --> 00:23:34,712
But I would do it again.

375
00:23:36,181 --> 00:23:39,266
I don't know how to raise a child
with someone who doesn't understand

376
00:23:39,368 --> 00:23:43,086
that there's a... a right
and a wrong in the world.

377
00:23:46,309 --> 00:23:51,361
So now I'm gonna be a bad mother,
that's where we're going with this?

378
00:23:51,464 --> 00:23:53,631
You've been saying it for weeks.

379
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:56,801
Maybe you're right.

380
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:02,255
OK.

381
00:24:02,357 --> 00:24:04,475
Maybe you're right.

382
00:24:04,577 --> 00:24:07,077
I just need some time to think.

383
00:24:07,813 --> 00:24:08,929
I just need some space.

384
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:18,105
Sarah Gordon, GCS at six, head injury
and multiple contusions to mid torso.

385
00:24:18,207 --> 00:24:20,874
- Systolic 70s in the field.
- Unaccompanied minor?

386
00:24:20,976 --> 00:24:25,128
- Yeah,
she was flying alone.
- On my count. One, two, three.

387
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:27,960
OK, I need X-ray in here. We
need to shoot a C-spine, chest...

388
00:24:27,984 --> 00:24:29,528
- Abdomen's rigid.
- I've got the ultrasound.

389
00:24:29,552 --> 00:24:31,152
Large hematoma on
the left temporal lobe.

390
00:24:31,186 --> 00:24:36,306
- Folks, we've got eyes.
- Sarah, I'm Dr. Shepherd.

391
00:24:36,408 --> 00:24:39,593
You see all these people
around you? They're doctors.

392
00:24:39,695 --> 00:24:42,175
You ever seen this
many doctors before?

393
00:24:42,581 --> 00:24:45,021
Don't worry, we're all here
to take care of you, OK?

394
00:24:45,935 --> 00:24:51,188
Hey, honey. They found his body.

395
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:54,458
Because his wallet
was still in his pocket.

396
00:24:55,394 --> 00:24:57,995
They said because the impact.

397
00:24:58,097 --> 00:25:01,832
I don't know, maybe it was fast.

398
00:25:03,736 --> 00:25:07,705
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

399
00:25:09,441 --> 00:25:12,776
There's no battery. I'm pushing
the button, I don't hear anything.

400
00:25:12,879 --> 00:25:15,245
- Honey, let me try.
- The battery is dead!

401
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:19,149
- What are you gonna try?
- OK, OK, OK, OK, OK.

402
00:25:19,251 --> 00:25:21,551
Ma'am, can I help you?

403
00:25:21,653 --> 00:25:25,306
We have to call someone,
but the cell phone's not working.

404
00:25:25,408 --> 00:25:27,708
OK, well we have phones
that you can use. Jenny?

405
00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:29,977
I'll do it. I'll do it.

406
00:25:32,097 --> 00:25:33,530
Why don't you take a seat?

407
00:25:39,838 --> 00:25:43,073
Excuse me. Is the
Gordon family here?

408
00:25:43,175 --> 00:25:44,541
The Gordons?

409
00:25:51,233 --> 00:25:54,028
- They found somebody?
- A little girl. Unaccompanied minor.

410
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:57,988
- They're operating
on her right now.
- Thank you.

411
00:25:59,074 --> 00:26:01,358
We should go home, honey.

412
00:26:03,662 --> 00:26:07,764
A little girl made it. She's
alive. I think we should stay.

413
00:26:07,866 --> 00:26:10,266
She doesn't have anyone.
Her parents aren't here yet.

414
00:26:10,352 --> 00:26:12,435
- I think we should stay.
- Gilda.

415
00:26:12,537 --> 00:26:14,497
If Matthew had been...

416
00:26:19,378 --> 00:26:23,079
I would like to stay.

417
00:26:31,807 --> 00:26:34,608
OK, OK.

418
00:26:35,411 --> 00:26:37,243
We'll stay.

419
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:48,605
I'll, um... I will let you
know how she's doing.

420
00:26:53,646 --> 00:26:56,930
- Mer.
- The adoption lady's paging me,

421
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:58,872
Derek's AWOL, he's
not even speaking to me.

422
00:26:58,967 --> 00:27:02,802
Wait. Is it true? What
were you thinking?

423
00:27:02,904 --> 00:27:05,772
I was thinking that the chief's
wife was about to have saline

424
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:08,136
injected in her brain instead
of a drug that could stop her

425
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,977
from becoming a gorked-out
lump. Derek's head almost exploded.

426
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,997
- Are they gonna fire you?
- I'm suspended.

427
00:27:13,099 --> 00:27:14,926
The chief backed way off
when he found out it was Adele.

428
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:17,217
- I did what I had to do.
- Meredith...

429
00:27:17,319 --> 00:27:20,920
I couldn't live with myself if
I'd done anything different.

430
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:25,892
And Karev is
trying to ruin my life!

431
00:27:25,994 --> 00:27:27,144
Mer.

432
00:27:29,565 --> 00:27:31,982
- What did you say to her?
- I didn't say anything.

433
00:27:32,068 --> 00:27:35,068
- Janet, anything he says...
- Can you shut up
for one second?

434
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:36,336
This isn't about that.

435
00:27:39,158 --> 00:27:41,825
We're granting you
temporary custody of Zola.

436
00:27:41,927 --> 00:27:46,213
Pending the completion of the petition,
at which point, assuming all goes well,

437
00:27:46,314 --> 00:27:48,949
you'll be granted
permanent custody.

438
00:27:49,051 --> 00:27:51,384
And her doctor here
says she's doing great.

439
00:27:51,486 --> 00:27:53,453
So you can take her home.

440
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:56,673
Today.

441
00:27:56,775 --> 00:27:59,159
Her incisions look fine.
She's tolerating a normal diet.

442
00:27:59,261 --> 00:28:03,230
She'll need neuro follow-ups.
She's still on antibiotics.

443
00:28:03,332 --> 00:28:06,033
Here's a prescription for any
pain meds she might need,

444
00:28:06,135 --> 00:28:08,068
but she's been fine
the last couple of days.

445
00:28:08,170 --> 00:28:10,320
Do you have any
questions about anything?

446
00:28:15,644 --> 00:28:17,728
Meredith, do you
have any questions?

447
00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:25,380
- Hey.
- Hi.

448
00:28:25,404 --> 00:28:28,321
- You done?
- Uh, no, no.

449
00:28:29,859 --> 00:28:32,125
I still have some more families.

450
00:28:32,227 --> 00:28:35,629
Sorry I paged you, I just
wanted to see your face.

451
00:28:35,731 --> 00:28:39,082
I think when something
like this happens, you just...

452
00:28:39,184 --> 00:28:41,851
You want to be with
someone that you love.

453
00:28:45,858 --> 00:28:48,275
So we're booked on
a 9am flight tomorrow.

454
00:28:48,377 --> 00:28:51,094
Let's just spend the
night in some fancy hotel,

455
00:28:51,196 --> 00:28:53,697
just never get out of the bath.

456
00:28:55,333 --> 00:28:56,650
You OK?

457
00:28:59,538 --> 00:29:05,075
Derek, I understand that you don't
want to talk to me, but this is important.

458
00:29:05,177 --> 00:29:06,810
I need to talk to you.

459
00:29:06,912 --> 00:29:10,880
I'm your wife. You
need to call me back.

460
00:29:17,923 --> 00:29:20,490
Does anyone know where there's
a nurse or an information person?

461
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:24,160
- She should be right back.
- My daughter was in the crash.

462
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:26,502
They said she had to have
surgery. Are we supposed to...?

463
00:29:26,532 --> 00:29:29,332
- You're Mrs. Gordon.
- Yes. Sarah Gordon is my...

464
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:33,202
They're still operating. The doctors
have been here every half hour.

465
00:29:33,305 --> 00:29:36,206
- They'll be here any minute.
- Say, would you
like some coffee?

466
00:29:36,308 --> 00:29:38,525
- I'll get it.
- Here, sit down.

467
00:29:38,627 --> 00:29:43,780
- You must have
been driving like crazy.
- I don't under... Are you...?

468
00:29:43,882 --> 00:29:45,365
We heard she was alone.

469
00:29:45,467 --> 00:29:49,069
I thought, as a parent, if
my child was here alone, I...

470
00:29:49,188 --> 00:29:52,956
We all thought that she should
have someone pulling for her.

471
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:58,612
Thank you. That's incredible.

472
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:06,903
Diapers. Swaddle blankets.

473
00:30:07,573 --> 00:30:10,039
And formula.

474
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:12,909
These little bottles are
good for the diaper bag.

475
00:30:13,011 --> 00:30:15,228
- You have a diaper bag?
- No.

476
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:17,847
We'll get you one, we've
got a few in the NICU closet.

477
00:30:17,949 --> 00:30:21,401
We have all this gear. The parents
come in, the baby doesn't make it,

478
00:30:21,503 --> 00:30:24,471
they don't want to see the
stuff, so they just leave it behind.

479
00:30:24,573 --> 00:30:30,560
Now, here's the pacifiers.
She likes the green ones.

480
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:32,624
Is your husband putting
the car seat in the car?

481
00:30:32,648 --> 00:30:35,598
I don't have a car seat. I'm
not even sure I have a husband.

482
00:30:35,701 --> 00:30:40,069
Surgeons, right? You probably forget
what he looks like without a mask.

483
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:43,691
We'll get you one. You're probably
gonna need a portacrib, too.

484
00:30:43,792 --> 00:30:46,159
I'm gonna throw in
some more diaper cream.

485
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:49,229
She went with her dad
to visit her grandparents.

486
00:30:49,331 --> 00:30:52,099
He had to stay, so he
put her on the plane.

487
00:30:52,201 --> 00:30:55,569
And there was a flight
attendant that watched her,

488
00:30:55,670 --> 00:30:59,005
and was supposed to walk her to
her connecting flight in Vancouver.

489
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:01,124
You never imagine...

490
00:31:02,344 --> 00:31:04,711
I'm sorry.

491
00:31:04,813 --> 00:31:07,997
I never even asked, you
had someone on the plane.

492
00:31:11,853 --> 00:31:13,853
My son, Matthew.

493
00:31:15,307 --> 00:31:16,723
Is he in surgery, too?

494
00:31:21,163 --> 00:31:23,163
Yes.

495
00:31:27,269 --> 00:31:32,673
- Will he be OK?
- Yes. He will.

496
00:31:35,176 --> 00:31:38,211
Sarah's out of surgery.
You can come see her now.

497
00:31:58,617 --> 00:32:00,250
I'm gonna pray for your son.

498
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,580
Hey.

499
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:32,593
Can you stand up?

500
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:34,735
I thought I was
pretty clear, Teddy.

501
00:32:34,837 --> 00:32:37,031
Just shut up and stand
up. I have to do something

502
00:32:37,055 --> 00:32:39,389
and I can't do it while
you're lying in a hospital bed.

503
00:32:39,491 --> 00:32:41,402
I don't want a goodbye hug.
It's gonna make you feel better,

504
00:32:41,426 --> 00:32:43,793
- it's not gonna make me feel...
- Can you just stand up?

505
00:33:10,205 --> 00:33:13,039
You're my husband, and...

506
00:33:15,343 --> 00:33:18,478
and I think I'm falling
in love with you.

507
00:33:36,814 --> 00:33:39,682
Hey. How you doing?

508
00:33:39,784 --> 00:33:41,617
- Not now, Mark.
- Come on, Lexie.

509
00:33:41,719 --> 00:33:45,905
- You've been
in the dead zone all day.
- You have to stop.

510
00:33:46,007 --> 00:33:48,908
You gotta stop talking to
me and checking on me

511
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:50,777
and talking to my boyfriend.

512
00:33:52,414 --> 00:33:55,782
I love you, and I'm
always gonna love you.

513
00:33:55,884 --> 00:33:59,269
But I don't want to love
you, I want to be happy.

514
00:33:59,371 --> 00:34:01,104
And Jackson makes me happy,

515
00:34:01,206 --> 00:34:06,742
and if you keep pulling at
me, I'm... I'll come back to you.

516
00:34:08,347 --> 00:34:11,114
You're right. I'm sorry.

517
00:34:11,216 --> 00:34:14,418
You got what you wanted.
You wanted a family.

518
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,686
Please, just let me
have what I want.

519
00:34:16,789 --> 00:34:18,069
I said you're right.

520
00:34:18,156 --> 00:34:20,740
I told Avery I
was letting you go.

521
00:34:20,843 --> 00:34:23,960
- Did he tell you that part?
- Yeah, it's
paternalistic and weird.

522
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:25,595
I'm letting you go, Lexie.

523
00:34:26,781 --> 00:34:28,981
That means you gotta...

524
00:34:29,917 --> 00:34:31,618
walk away.

525
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:43,563
Chief friggin'
resident. Unbelievable.

526
00:34:43,665 --> 00:34:48,368
- I'm sorry.
- What? Don't be. You deserve it.

527
00:34:48,470 --> 00:34:49,885
I'm happy.

528
00:34:52,257 --> 00:34:54,657
- I have what I want.
- It's been such a crappy year.

529
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:57,376
I can't believe
we're both happy.

530
00:34:57,478 --> 00:34:59,540
I can't believe they like me
enough to make me chief resident.

531
00:34:59,564 --> 00:35:02,893
They hated me for so long. I can't
believe I actually have friends here.

532
00:35:02,917 --> 00:35:04,850
Well, they're gonna
hate you again.

533
00:35:04,952 --> 00:35:08,889
It's now your job to
boss them around.

534
00:35:08,991 --> 00:35:11,123
You know how
much they love that.

535
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:14,177
Oh, God. Is that true?

536
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:17,630
That's true!

537
00:35:20,919 --> 00:35:24,154
OK, so this is the house.

538
00:35:24,256 --> 00:35:26,722
There's another house, where
you're gonna have your own room,

539
00:35:26,825 --> 00:35:30,109
but that, right now, is
just wood and no walls,

540
00:35:30,212 --> 00:35:33,313
so we're gonna stay
here for a while. Derek?

541
00:35:34,683 --> 00:35:38,518
OK. He might be AWOL,
he's had a bad day

542
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:41,153
and he's a little...

543
00:35:42,657 --> 00:35:46,759
pissed off right now,
but we're gonna be fine.

544
00:35:46,861 --> 00:35:50,129
So we had a big plan
if this ever worked out.

545
00:35:50,232 --> 00:35:54,767
We were gonna have a lullaby from Malawi
to make everything feel homey for you.

546
00:35:54,869 --> 00:35:58,871
To be honest, right now I can't
even think of an American lullaby.

547
00:35:59,791 --> 00:36:01,691
Lexie?

548
00:36:06,231 --> 00:36:09,632
You know, a lot of people live
here. It gets kind of crazy sometimes,

549
00:36:09,734 --> 00:36:12,369
and it's usually not this quiet.

550
00:36:16,074 --> 00:36:17,290
Alex?

551
00:36:27,452 --> 00:36:29,202
OK.

552
00:36:30,338 --> 00:36:33,006
We're gonna be OK.

553
00:36:33,108 --> 00:36:37,710
You and I, we're a team, right?
We're tough. We have that in common.

554
00:36:39,981 --> 00:36:42,115
I am very glad you're here.

555
00:36:42,217 --> 00:36:45,718
I didn't think your first day
was gonna be quite like this.

556
00:36:45,821 --> 00:36:50,990
But I'm gonna get it together,
and we are gonna figure it out.

557
00:37:02,687 --> 00:37:04,654
Tell me how much you love me.

558
00:37:04,756 --> 00:37:08,758
I...

559
00:37:10,495 --> 00:37:13,329
I love you a very great deal.

560
00:37:13,432 --> 00:37:16,182
A lot.

561
00:37:16,284 --> 00:37:20,870
You love me so much. I
want you to remember that.

562
00:37:27,845 --> 00:37:32,081
I made an appointment
to terminate the pregnancy.

563
00:37:33,669 --> 00:37:36,069
- You...
- I'm sorry if this upsets you.

564
00:37:36,171 --> 00:37:39,856
I'm sorry if this isn't
what you wanted, but...

565
00:37:39,958 --> 00:37:43,960
I cannot talk about it anymore.
I... need to lie down. I feel like crap.

566
00:37:44,062 --> 00:37:48,281
This is a marriage.
I tied my life to you.

567
00:37:48,383 --> 00:37:50,150
You don't decide
this without me!

568
00:37:50,252 --> 00:37:53,219
- Do you see me standing here?
- My head is killing me.

569
00:37:53,321 --> 00:37:57,356
You give in a marriage,
you make sacrifices.

570
00:37:57,458 --> 00:38:00,510
I have made many. And I am
asking you to do something for me.

571
00:38:00,612 --> 00:38:04,063
Could you simply consider
doing something for me?

572
00:38:04,165 --> 00:38:08,501
Have a baby? This isn't pizza versus
Thai, you don't give a little on a baby.

573
00:38:08,603 --> 00:38:12,589
- Cristina, I am asking you...
- I'm saying no!

574
00:38:30,758 --> 00:38:31,941
Get out.

575
00:38:33,911 --> 00:38:37,913
Are you...? Because
I'm denying you a baby...

576
00:38:38,016 --> 00:38:40,383
Because you denied
me part of the decision.

577
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:42,618
Because you denied
me a marriage.

578
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,488
- Oh, how dare you!
- Get out!

579
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:52,762
- Hi.
- Hey.

580
00:38:52,864 --> 00:38:58,468
I'm gonna go. I just
wanted to say good night.

581
00:38:59,854 --> 00:39:01,487
I wanna come home with you.

582
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:05,958
N... No, I can't. Um,
Tuck's with me tonight.

583
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:08,862
I can meet your son. I'm
not gonna bite your son.

584
00:39:08,964 --> 00:39:11,831
No, it's just not
the right time.

585
00:39:11,933 --> 00:39:14,451
- I can't...
- This is a relationship.

586
00:39:14,553 --> 00:39:17,904
Things today were bad. We lean
on each other when things are bad.

587
00:39:18,006 --> 00:39:19,683
That information's not
gonna hurt your child.

588
00:39:19,707 --> 00:39:22,358
And if it does, then this is not
the right relationship for me.

589
00:39:23,845 --> 00:39:27,197
I can control myself in your
house. I'm not gonna touch you.

590
00:39:27,299 --> 00:39:29,465
- OK.
- You can tell
him I'm your friend.

591
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:32,869
- Tell him whatever you need to.
- OK!

592
00:39:37,758 --> 00:39:38,924
OK.

593
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:05,179
Oh. I was hoping you were Derek.

594
00:40:05,203 --> 00:40:06,552
Sorry.

595
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:09,222
Well, he took off, and the
hospital gave me a baby.

596
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:12,258
She's upstairs sleeping in
some dead kid's portacrib.

597
00:40:13,427 --> 00:40:15,661
Wow. Uh...

598
00:40:15,763 --> 00:40:19,298
I'm getting an abortion and Owen
just kicked me out of my house.

599
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:22,168
- What? You're...?
- Pregnant.

600
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:24,437
- And you're...?
- Getting an abortion.

601
00:40:24,539 --> 00:40:28,040
Well... Why didn't you tell me?

602
00:40:29,694 --> 00:40:31,260
You had a busy, busy day.

603
00:40:31,362 --> 00:40:34,580
<i>There's a reason I
said I'd be happy alone.</i>

604
00:40:37,018 --> 00:40:41,253
- Come upstairs. I need help.
- I... I can't.

605
00:40:42,157 --> 00:40:43,522
I've gotta lie down.

606
00:40:43,624 --> 00:40:47,092
<i>It wasn't 'cause I thought
I'd be happy alone.</i>

607
00:40:50,664 --> 00:40:56,319
<i>It was because I thought if I loved
someone, and then it fell apart...</i>

608
00:40:58,123 --> 00:41:00,323
<i>I might not make it.</i>

609
00:41:01,893 --> 00:41:04,427
Tell me not to go to Africa.

610
00:41:06,031 --> 00:41:08,431
Alex.

611
00:41:08,533 --> 00:41:10,166
Go to hell.

612
00:41:13,538 --> 00:41:16,372
<i>It's easier to be alone.</i>

613
00:41:18,043 --> 00:41:21,311
<i>Because what if you
learn that you need love...</i>

614
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:25,681
<i>and then you don't have it?</i>

615
00:41:25,783 --> 00:41:27,817
<i>What if you like it?</i>

616
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:30,954
<i>And lean on it?</i>

617
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:36,492
<i>What if you shape
your life around it,</i>

618
00:41:36,594 --> 00:41:38,661
<i>and then...</i>

619
00:41:41,432 --> 00:41:44,433
<i>it falls apart?</i>

620
00:41:44,535 --> 00:41:46,870
<i>Can you even survive
that kind of pain?</i>

621
00:41:49,774 --> 00:41:52,591
<i>Losing love is
like organ damage.</i>

622
00:41:54,729 --> 00:41:57,330
<i>It's like dying.</i>

623
00:42:00,769 --> 00:42:03,219
<i>The only difference is...</i>

624
00:42:04,723 --> 00:42:06,856
<i>death ends.</i>

625
00:42:08,226 --> 00:42:09,726
<i>This...</i>

626
00:42:11,896 --> 00:42:13,763
<i>it could go on forever.</i>
