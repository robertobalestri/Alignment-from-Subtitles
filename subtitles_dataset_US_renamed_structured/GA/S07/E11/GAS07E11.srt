1
00:00:02,769 --> 00:00:05,871
<i>To a degree,
medicine is a science.</i>

2
00:00:05,973 --> 00:00:08,240
- You spent six hours on a boat?
- Yes.

3
00:00:08,342 --> 00:00:09,752
- And you talked about fishing.
- Yes.

4
00:00:09,776 --> 00:00:12,011
- For six hours.
- Pretty much, yeah.

5
00:00:12,113 --> 00:00:14,596
- Derek...
- What do you want me to say?

6
00:00:14,698 --> 00:00:16,598
We went fishing, we
talked about fishing.

7
00:00:16,717 --> 00:00:18,728
- I want the whole story.
- That is the whole story.

8
00:00:18,752 --> 00:00:21,420
"She caught a fish and
cried," is not the whole story.

9
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:25,306
Except it is the story. It
is, in fact, the entire story.

10
00:00:27,978 --> 00:00:30,562
- I'm ovulating.
- Ugh...

11
00:00:30,664 --> 00:00:34,466
<i>But I would argue
that it's also an art.</i>

12
00:00:34,568 --> 00:00:36,846
I mean, you stole my
best friend, and it's not OK!

13
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,532
It's not OK for the two of you
to hang out like I don't exist!

14
00:00:39,556 --> 00:00:41,356
I am not hanging out,
I am trying to help her!

15
00:00:41,408 --> 00:00:44,109
By hanging out with her!

16
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:47,195
- Are we gonna do this or not?
- I'm too mad
to even look at you.

17
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:48,897
Well, then, roll over.

18
00:00:51,401 --> 00:00:52,401
Fine.

19
00:00:55,605 --> 00:00:58,707
<i>The doctors who see
medicine as science only?</i>

20
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:02,644
<i>You don't want them by your
side when your bleeding won't stop,</i>

21
00:01:02,746 --> 00:01:05,047
<i>or when your child
is screaming in pain.</i>

22
00:01:05,149 --> 00:01:08,650
You look different.
You seem better.

23
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,920
- I feel better.
- Really?

24
00:01:12,022 --> 00:01:13,371
Mm-hm.

25
00:01:16,443 --> 00:01:18,310
So you have plans?

26
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,908
I think I'm gonna
explore the city today.

27
00:01:21,932 --> 00:01:24,966
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

28
00:01:25,069 --> 00:01:28,203
You know, I've never
had time to do it before.

29
00:01:28,305 --> 00:01:31,439
Or the interest.

30
00:01:34,278 --> 00:01:35,943
Hello?

31
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:41,667
Teddy, you're doing what?

32
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:46,437
<i>The clinicians go by the book.</i>

33
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:49,908
<i>- The artists follow their guts.
- -</i> Mm!

34
00:01:50,911 --> 00:01:52,351
- Uh...
- Oh!

35
00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:54,996
You're gonna make us late.

36
00:01:55,833 --> 00:01:57,273
- OK.
- Mm!

37
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:00,001
OK. Go.

38
00:02:00,104 --> 00:02:01,469
Go.

39
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:04,556
Nope!

40
00:02:09,112 --> 00:02:10,992
<i>The artists feel your pain.</i>

41
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:14,082
<i>And they go to
extremes to make it stop.</i>

42
00:02:17,037 --> 00:02:18,853
You sat here all night?

43
00:02:22,009 --> 00:02:24,993
Um... Well, no.

44
00:02:25,095 --> 00:02:28,680
Just flew in from Africa, so I
went to a hotel and took a shower,

45
00:02:28,782 --> 00:02:32,984
got some sleep, and
came back really early.

46
00:02:34,754 --> 00:02:38,656
Really, please,
go back to Malawi.

47
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,977
<i>Extreme measures.</i>

48
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:45,180
<i>That's where science
ends, and art begins.</i>

49
00:02:57,378 --> 00:02:58,988
We can do this
another day, if you want.

50
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:02,614
No, no. I mean, no, we're
here now. And he'll be here.

51
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:10,817
Hey. Oh! Hey. My witness is
here. OK, let's get this thing started.

52
00:03:10,841 --> 00:03:13,675
Teddy, you're not
seriously gonna do this?

53
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:14,876
Yeah, I am.

54
00:03:14,979 --> 00:03:17,579
- Henry Burton.
- Owen Hunt.

55
00:03:17,681 --> 00:03:20,949
OK, then. Will you be reading vows or
do you just want a standard ceremony?

56
00:03:21,051 --> 00:03:25,203
Oh! Crap. Uh, it's work.
Um, I'm just gonna let it roll.

57
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:28,225
- Standard ceremony?
- Maybe you could
just skip to the end.

58
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:32,444
- Sorry. I'm just... I'm really late.
- Come.

59
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:45,790
Excuse me. Can you direct
me to the Space Needle?

60
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:48,076
It's your, uh, first
time in Seattle, huh?

61
00:03:48,178 --> 00:03:52,096
- Um... sure, OK.
- You're just gonna
want to go west

62
00:03:52,198 --> 00:03:56,518
on Union about eight blocks or so,
and then you turn north and you should...

63
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:01,656
Must be a bad accident.

64
00:04:04,944 --> 00:04:10,498
Hey, that's not west.
You're going the wrong way.

65
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,046
I'll travel to Malawi every two
months for the next three years,

66
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:15,815
to oversee everything, and I
got a leading pediatric surgeon

67
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:17,550
to oversee the
day-to-day operations.

68
00:04:17,574 --> 00:04:21,276
Dr. Robbins, I signed a contract
with a new Peds attending.

69
00:04:21,378 --> 00:04:23,928
It's a year-long contract.
I can't eat that money.

70
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:26,197
- I just don't have it.
- Well, I don't understand.

71
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:30,601
So you're saying I can't...
Wh... I can't have a job here?

72
00:04:30,703 --> 00:04:32,404
Dr. Robbins, you're back!

73
00:04:32,505 --> 00:04:34,650
Now, that is the
reaction I was hoping for!

74
00:04:34,674 --> 00:04:37,191
- Uh, excuse me, Dr. Robbins.
- So, Karev.

75
00:04:37,293 --> 00:04:40,411
Tell me about this new Peds guy.

76
00:04:40,514 --> 00:04:42,325
You're married.
You married that guy.

77
00:04:42,349 --> 00:04:44,716
- So? You got married.
- To the woman I love!

78
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:47,338
- You don't even know this guy.
- Look, the man
needed insurance.

79
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:50,221
- Can we not talk
about this, please?
- Not ever, or not right now?

80
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:52,757
- I'm thinking not ever.
- What's going on?

81
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:57,179
<i>Major Seattle area shooting. We have
reports that a gunman has opened fire</i>

82
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,432
<i>- on students and faculty</i>
- Bailey? Bailey, fill us in.

83
00:05:01,535 --> 00:05:04,335
<i>We now take you live
to our on scene reporter.</i>

84
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:06,048
<i>Students and faculty
are still in the building.</i>

85
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:07,933
I'm trying to get answers,
but what we know

86
00:05:07,957 --> 00:05:10,358
so far is that a gunman
opened fire at Pacific College,

87
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:11,904
and that there are
at least a dozen...

88
00:05:11,928 --> 00:05:15,864
I'm sorry? OK. OK,
there at least 20 victims.

89
00:05:15,965 --> 00:05:19,467
I'm sorry. You can't be here. Clear
the area, please. Clear, please!

90
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:22,920
- Move back, people. Move, back up.
- Let's go. Come on.

91
00:05:23,023 --> 00:05:25,268
He's bleeding out from his
chest wound. Pulse is thready,

92
00:05:25,292 --> 00:05:28,476
and he's bled through the
dressing. We're going priority one.

93
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:32,047
V-tach on the monitor.
Any pulse with that?

94
00:05:32,149 --> 00:05:35,616
No pulse. Starting CPR.
Let's get him to the hospital.

95
00:05:35,718 --> 00:05:39,771
You need to crack his chest. You
need... Someone crack his chest!

96
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:45,076
There are 15 ambulances on
the way, maybe more to come.

97
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:47,312
First one is three minutes out.

98
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:51,550
People, people.

99
00:05:51,652 --> 00:05:55,020
Our own trauma is fresh and
we are gonna have feelings today,

100
00:05:55,122 --> 00:05:57,905
and there's no shame in
that. What I want to say is

101
00:05:58,008 --> 00:06:01,526
what we went through six months
ago, they are going through right now.

102
00:06:01,628 --> 00:06:04,312
Which makes them
our brothers and sisters.

103
00:06:04,414 --> 00:06:08,784
Which makes them fellow
travelers. Which makes them our own.

104
00:06:10,487 --> 00:06:12,937
So, to the very
best of our ability,

105
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,756
we are gonna do our work first,

106
00:06:14,858 --> 00:06:18,342
and you're gonna
have your feelings later.

107
00:06:20,581 --> 00:06:23,014
- Grey?
- I'm fine.

108
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:25,049
I'm fine!

109
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:27,330
Go to the pit and make sure
we're stocked. Call the blood bank...

110
00:06:27,354 --> 00:06:32,023
- I'm fine.
- Call the blood bank.

111
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:34,542
Tell them to give us
all the O neg they have.

112
00:06:40,884 --> 00:06:43,317
- All right.
- Look alive.

113
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:50,041
I got a cop, Michael Fazioli, 28,
GSW to the right upper arm and left leg.

114
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:52,772
- OK, this one's mine.
- - All right, I'm on that one.

115
00:06:52,796 --> 00:06:55,030
- Chief Webber.
- Sarge?

116
00:06:57,117 --> 00:07:00,196
All right, Kepner, get him to
trauma one. Get labs, trauma series

117
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,703
- and X-ray this leg and arm.
- OK.

118
00:07:01,805 --> 00:07:04,639
This is the cop that
took down the shooter.

119
00:07:04,741 --> 00:07:06,502
- You're kidding.
- No, he was on the radio,

120
00:07:06,526 --> 00:07:08,438
he told me he landed a
shot, then he went down.

121
00:07:08,462 --> 00:07:11,290
I've got conflicting reports about
what the shooter looked like.

122
00:07:11,314 --> 00:07:13,192
If you could wake Faz
up and get him talking...

123
00:07:13,216 --> 00:07:16,334
- Faz?
- Mike Fazioli. He's a good kid.

124
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,569
Great cop. One of ours.

125
00:07:18,672 --> 00:07:20,772
- What do you have?
- Professor John Sturgeon, 48,

126
00:07:20,874 --> 00:07:23,853
fell out a fourth story window, has an
open skull fracture and a blown pupil.

127
00:07:23,877 --> 00:07:26,206
- He fell?
- He helped a dozen kids out the window

128
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:28,441
and up onto the roof. Then he
tried to go himself and slipped.

129
00:07:28,465 --> 00:07:31,999
He's herniating. Get him to the
front of the line. Get him in the OR.

130
00:07:32,102 --> 00:07:35,002
- You OK?
- Nothing about this is OK.

131
00:07:35,989 --> 00:07:38,856
Two and three are open.

132
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,910
Fifteen year old, Kelly Keck,
GSW's to the leg and abdomen.

133
00:07:42,012 --> 00:07:45,714
Abdomen rigid, systolic
75, last pulse 147.

134
00:07:45,816 --> 00:07:47,256
- She's 15?
- Yeah.

135
00:07:47,317 --> 00:07:49,228
Look what being
a genius gets you.

136
00:07:49,252 --> 00:07:52,220
- Clear trauma three and page Stark!
- - Right away, doctor.

137
00:07:52,322 --> 00:07:54,873
Jared Swork, 20 years
old, single entrance wound

138
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:57,008
to the left fifth intercostal
space, no exit wound.

139
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:59,744
Lost vitals in front of us. This
is the emergency thoracotomy

140
00:07:59,846 --> 00:08:02,291
- we called in about.
- You did a thoracotomy
in the field?

141
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:03,864
No, I didn't.

142
00:08:06,737 --> 00:08:08,602
I had to crack his chest.

143
00:08:19,983 --> 00:08:22,167
- Cristina.
- Can you feel the lesion?

144
00:08:22,269 --> 00:08:23,913
Yes, he's got a big
hole in his right ventricle.

145
00:08:23,937 --> 00:08:26,115
But, as long as I keep my hand
here, I can feel a good heartbeat.

146
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:27,851
- Cristina!
- What? What?!

147
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:28,875
You're going to the OR?

148
00:08:28,976 --> 00:08:30,702
She's got her hand
on the hole, Owen.

149
00:08:30,726 --> 00:08:32,460
I'll be fine. I'll be OK.

150
00:08:34,982 --> 00:08:40,018
- Can we stop in front of the...
- - Bring him to two.

151
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:46,902
This artery is in pieces.

152
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:48,437
- Vascular clamp.
- Here you go.

153
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:49,672
Your best move is
to amputate that leg.

154
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:51,173
You got no more
time to waste there.

155
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,625
- What? What?
- The artery's blown,

156
00:08:52,649 --> 00:08:55,133
- the femur is shattered.
- Torres can fix that.

157
00:08:55,235 --> 00:08:57,180
I'm more concerned
about the life than the leg,

158
00:08:57,204 --> 00:09:00,164
- and I'm sure her
parents will be, too.
- Look, this kid is 15.

159
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:01,968
You can save this leg.
You can't just cut it off.

160
00:09:01,992 --> 00:09:04,353
What I can't do is to spend
any more time arguing with you.

161
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:07,417
Would you maintain pressure
there? Prep the damn leg, Karev.

162
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:16,888
Freakin' do something!

163
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:23,861
Intracranial pressure's
getting higher.

164
00:09:23,964 --> 00:09:25,997
Are we doing a
craniectomy or a craniotomy?

165
00:09:26,099 --> 00:09:27,866
Craniectomy is our best bet.

166
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:33,454
Dr. Shepherd, the professor's wife
just arrived. Can someone speak to her?

167
00:09:33,556 --> 00:09:35,574
I'll go. I'll be quick.

168
00:09:42,132 --> 00:09:45,533
You paged me? Yang?

169
00:09:45,635 --> 00:09:47,229
- I was at the scene.
- She was at the scene.

170
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:49,404
He's got a tear on
the right ventricle

171
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:51,734
and there could be torrential
bleeding once we get in.

172
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:54,191
So I just, uh, want
a little backup.

173
00:09:54,294 --> 00:09:56,622
- Just a little extra backup.
- She's not sure
if I can handle it.

174
00:09:56,646 --> 00:09:59,597
I'm ready. I'm
in. I'll go scrub.

175
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:02,417
All right. Let's get
this boy on bypass.

176
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:13,461
It's just crazy. We have so many
here, he couldn't tell me anything.

177
00:10:15,265 --> 00:10:17,465
- Mrs. Sturgeon?
- Yes. Hi.

178
00:10:17,567 --> 00:10:19,261
- Hi.
- Are you John's doctor? Is he OK?

179
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:22,720
He fell from a fourth story
window and landed on his head.

180
00:10:22,805 --> 00:10:26,074
- So we're
taking him to surgery...
- Wait, wait, surgery?

181
00:10:26,176 --> 00:10:28,843
We will be removing
the left side of his skull

182
00:10:28,945 --> 00:10:30,578
to give his brain room to swell.

183
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,797
OK, I'm gonna come with you.

184
00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:35,945
I need to come with you because
John doesn't like hospitals.

185
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:38,703
- You can't come into the OR.
- No, see,

186
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:41,772
John is afraid of doctors. OK?

187
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:44,542
So I have to be with him.
Please let me be with him.

188
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:48,830
Mrs. Sturgeon, I'm so sorry,
but you can't come into the OR.

189
00:10:48,932 --> 00:10:52,800
I will come out and update you
every chance I get, though. OK?

190
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:56,521
- Just, uh... Excuse me. Hi.
- Yes?

191
00:10:56,623 --> 00:10:59,423
Would you sit with Mrs. Sturgeon?
This is gonna be a long day,

192
00:10:59,525 --> 00:11:01,760
and you all need to take
care of each other, OK?

193
00:11:01,862 --> 00:11:03,411
OK.

194
00:11:08,368 --> 00:11:10,768
You can put in a shunt
and then do a graft.

195
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,164
Do you even have
privileges here anymore?

196
00:11:12,188 --> 00:11:14,083
Whether I have privileges
or not isn't the point.

197
00:11:14,107 --> 00:11:16,857
- Karev's right.
- Karev is not
on this case anymore.

198
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:20,178
Dr. Stark, please, take the time to
do the graft, and you can save her leg.

199
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:23,414
I know very well what can
and can't be done, Dr. Robbins.

200
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:26,618
I have bigger fish to fry. And this
was very unprofessional of you.

201
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,088
I am all done engaging with it.

202
00:11:30,173 --> 00:11:32,451
All right, get the hell
out of my OR, Karev.

203
00:11:32,475 --> 00:11:37,145
I'm sorry, I'm unprofessional?
I'm unprof...? I...

204
00:11:37,247 --> 00:11:40,130
Body block him, Karev!
Don't let him near that leg!

205
00:11:45,888 --> 00:11:48,907
He's got some blood in his
chest, but the bullet's not there.

206
00:11:49,009 --> 00:11:52,476
It's not in his leg or
in his arm. Kepner?

207
00:11:52,579 --> 00:11:54,045
Uh... Uh...

208
00:11:54,147 --> 00:11:56,192
We should put in a chest tube
and get more studies to see

209
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:57,694
what damage we're dealing with.

210
00:11:57,718 --> 00:11:59,461
Is there any chance
we can wake him up

211
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:00,629
while we're waiting
for the studies?

212
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:01,886
I could reverse his pain meds,

213
00:12:01,988 --> 00:12:03,748
but it would be a pretty
traumatic awakening.

214
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:05,835
- He'd be in a lot of pain.
- - I'm getting all sorts

215
00:12:05,859 --> 00:12:08,299
of conflicting reports as to
what this shooter looks like.

216
00:12:08,361 --> 00:12:11,596
Kids in shock, they don't remember,
but cops are trained to remember.

217
00:12:11,698 --> 00:12:14,710
I don't know if there's a second
shooter, if this is some kind of plot.

218
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:17,502
But until I have a positive
ID, I've got nothing.

219
00:12:17,604 --> 00:12:21,806
Believe me, Faz would rather feel
some pain if he can ID the shooter for me.

220
00:12:22,792 --> 00:12:24,392
OK, I'll reverse the meds.

221
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:26,277
Kepner, let's set
up the chest tube.

222
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:28,279
Chief Webber? This
guy you replaced me with

223
00:12:28,381 --> 00:12:30,008
- is a study in incompetence.
- Not now, Robbins.

224
00:12:30,032 --> 00:12:31,877
No, yes now! Because
Dr. Incompetence is about

225
00:12:31,901 --> 00:12:33,429
to hack off a
perfectly good leg.

226
00:12:33,453 --> 00:12:35,348
Robbins, I'm pretty busy here.
What do you want me to do?

227
00:12:35,372 --> 00:12:37,282
- Give me privileges.
- It's all hands on deck.

228
00:12:37,306 --> 00:12:39,607
- Of course you have privileges.
- OK, thank you.

229
00:12:42,645 --> 00:12:45,045
It's not an easy day to
be the man in charge.

230
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:53,887
- Torres, OR two,
right now! 911!
- What? Where are you going?

231
00:12:53,989 --> 00:12:56,507
- I need scrubs.
- Uh, OK...

232
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:59,210
Bailey, can you take
over for me here?

233
00:12:59,312 --> 00:13:02,080
This is, uh, Chuck
Fowler. He's 21 years old,

234
00:13:02,182 --> 00:13:04,749
zone two injury of the neck
secondary to graze GSW.

235
00:13:04,851 --> 00:13:08,331
He has a hematoma, and a CT
angio has been ordered. Thank you.

236
00:13:08,388 --> 00:13:10,688
How you doing, Chuck?

237
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:14,458
Who walks into a classroom with an
automatic weapon? Who does that?

238
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:19,330
I don't know. I don't know.

239
00:13:19,432 --> 00:13:22,333
OK, here I go.

240
00:13:23,319 --> 00:13:24,747
I'm a wrestler,
man. I'm All-State.

241
00:13:24,771 --> 00:13:26,565
Saw or no saw, you're
not getting past me!

242
00:13:26,589 --> 00:13:28,234
Karev? You wanna tell
me what's going on here?

243
00:13:28,258 --> 00:13:30,157
He's lost his mind, that's
what's going on here.

244
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:33,177
He's lost his mind and
he's destroying his career.

245
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,780
- That is what is going on here!
- Check it out, Torres.

246
00:13:35,882 --> 00:13:39,050
Fifteen-year-old GSW to the thigh
with comminuted femur fracture.

247
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:42,592
Laceration is the
superficial femoral artery. Ha!

248
00:13:44,641 --> 00:13:46,819
All right. What about her nerves?
Are her nerves salvageable?

249
00:13:46,843 --> 00:13:49,661
Kid was moving her leg before
we put her under. They're intact.

250
00:13:49,763 --> 00:13:52,246
She has a life-threatening
hemorrhage in her leg,

251
00:13:52,348 --> 00:13:54,276
and multi-organ
injuries in her abdomen!

252
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,367
Abdominal bleeding is
under control for now.

253
00:13:56,469 --> 00:13:58,803
Thanks so much, Dave. I
appreciate the support there.

254
00:13:58,905 --> 00:14:01,116
Well, I can put in a traction
pin to stabilize the femur.

255
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,618
- Right?
- And then we can use a graft

256
00:14:02,642 --> 00:14:04,220
- to restore blood flow.
- That's what I'm saying!

257
00:14:04,244 --> 00:14:06,627
I have never experienced
anything like this

258
00:14:06,729 --> 00:14:07,969
before in my life!

259
00:14:07,997 --> 00:14:09,957
Dr. Stark, you're new
here. But, in this hospital,

260
00:14:09,983 --> 00:14:12,433
we take shootings personally.
And I can save this leg.

261
00:14:12,535 --> 00:14:16,887
- So are you gonna
work with me or not?
- No, no, I am.

262
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:19,568
Dr. Stark, I've spoken with Chief
Webber. This is my patient now.

263
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:21,743
What? This is...

264
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:25,563
This...

265
00:14:27,049 --> 00:14:30,034
- Yes!
- Karev, you gotta go, too.

266
00:14:30,136 --> 00:14:32,832
The pit's full of kids that need doctors
and we can handle this without you.

267
00:14:32,856 --> 00:14:37,157
That's cool. My work is
done. Ha! All-State, baby!

268
00:14:42,716 --> 00:14:44,459
See that bridging vein?

269
00:14:44,483 --> 00:14:47,769
You'll have to compromise it if
you're gonna pull the skull flap up.

270
00:14:47,871 --> 00:14:49,370
Mm-hm.

271
00:14:52,691 --> 00:14:55,343
I'll be right back. I'm gonna
go update the wife again.

272
00:14:55,445 --> 00:14:57,239
Dr. Grey, you're a
surgeon, not a social worker.

273
00:14:57,263 --> 00:14:58,663
You can't spare
me for five minutes?

274
00:14:58,697 --> 00:15:00,091
And we have a
patient on the table.

275
00:15:00,115 --> 00:15:01,999
That's not the whole story.

276
00:15:02,102 --> 00:15:04,396
Don't start this again.

277
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:07,655
The other part of the story is that
he's got a wife who is panicking...

278
00:15:07,757 --> 00:15:10,707
- Fine. Go. Just let me concentrate.
- I'll be quick.

279
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,947
All right, he's ready.

280
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:21,018
I'm gonna push the naloxone.

281
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,804
He's gonna wake up and he's
gonna hurt. So talk quick, OK?

282
00:15:23,906 --> 00:15:25,756
Ready.

283
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:33,998
Faz. It's Marty.

284
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:35,344
Can you hear me?

285
00:15:35,368 --> 00:15:38,035
Oh, God, it hurts.

286
00:15:39,806 --> 00:15:41,755
Oh, God!

287
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:45,860
Faz, I need you to describe the
shooter. Can you do that for me, bud?

288
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:56,053
Chief Webber, did you really
approve of Robbins storming my OR?

289
00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:59,023
Stealing my patient?
Humiliating me publicly?

290
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:02,693
There are plenty patients to go
around, Dr. Stark. Jump in and find one.

291
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:06,964
I will not. What I will do is to go
back to my patient, in my OR...

292
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:11,986
Go be a damn doctor! People are
dying! Now go save a life, right now!

293
00:16:18,745 --> 00:16:20,739
<i>- I'm here</i>
<i>with Officer Murphy.</i>
- Just hang on.

294
00:16:20,763 --> 00:16:23,208
- I need the info... Excuse me...
- OK, I understand.

295
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:24,398
Dr. Hunt?

296
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,001
I'm free. Do you
need me? I'm free.

297
00:16:27,103 --> 00:16:29,270
Dr. Hunt.

298
00:16:29,372 --> 00:16:31,116
They just found another
classroom full of victims.

299
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:33,757
- We're getting
at least a dozen more.
- Crap.

300
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,392
- We're out of ORs.
- What?

301
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:38,095
We're out of ORs.
We're out of space.

302
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:42,734
And all other hospitals are at capacity.
If any of them need surgery, we're...

303
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:46,404
We're screwed.

304
00:16:57,667 --> 00:17:01,269
Dr. Altman, we have
a GSW to the chest...

305
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:04,806
- Dr. Yang?
- Dr. Yang
was on the scene.

306
00:17:04,908 --> 00:17:07,041
She performed an emergency
thoracotomy in the field.

307
00:17:07,143 --> 00:17:09,593
- You all right,
Dr. Yang?
- Yes, sir.

308
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:12,530
- I'm staying, if that's OK.
- Dr. Yang,
can you tell me

309
00:17:12,631 --> 00:17:14,932
what your patient was wearing,
or where his clothes are?

310
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:18,336
Uh, they were cut off at
the scene. It was, um...

311
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:20,187
a green hoodie, jeans.

312
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:23,090
Is he a redhead, about 20?

313
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:28,979
- Yes.
- Uh, why, sir?

314
00:17:29,082 --> 00:17:33,016
Send me down any bullet
fragments you pull out of his body.

315
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,454
Chief, what's going on?

316
00:17:38,841 --> 00:17:40,441
The patient's the shooter.

317
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:48,082
Send down any bullets
immediately. They're evidence.

318
00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:00,478
OK.

319
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:03,815
OK, where were we?

320
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:05,544
You were about to
reconstruct the ventricle.

321
00:18:05,568 --> 00:18:08,352
Right. Right, thank you. OK.

322
00:18:08,454 --> 00:18:10,621
Hand me three-oh
Ethibond, please.

323
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:15,142
I'm sorry. I'm sorry,
but I can't, Dr. Altman.

324
00:18:15,244 --> 00:18:19,113
- You can't
hand me the Ethibond?
- I can't...

325
00:18:19,215 --> 00:18:20,781
She can't save this guy

326
00:18:20,883 --> 00:18:22,933
is what she's saying.

327
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:24,930
He just shot up
dozens of people!

328
00:18:24,954 --> 00:18:26,765
And this surgery is
gonna take all day.

329
00:18:26,789 --> 00:18:29,317
- Dr. Avery...
- That's taking three doctors
and four nurses away

330
00:18:29,341 --> 00:18:30,707
from helping other people.

331
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:32,904
People who didn't shoot up
a campus full of innocent kids!

332
00:18:32,928 --> 00:18:34,428
Dr. Avery!

333
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:38,599
I operated on Iraqi soldiers
who blew up dozens of our guys.

334
00:18:38,717 --> 00:18:42,436
I didn't like it, but I did it,

335
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:46,073
because I'm a doctor
and I took an oath.

336
00:18:46,175 --> 00:18:48,743
You're not a jury or a judge.

337
00:18:48,845 --> 00:18:52,379
If there's a life to be saved,
we save that life regardless...

338
00:18:52,481 --> 00:18:56,033
I'm not doing this. No.

339
00:18:59,788 --> 00:19:03,124
- Anyone else?
- I'm sorry.

340
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:15,135
Dr. Yang... are you staying?

341
00:19:16,172 --> 00:19:18,005
Yes.

342
00:19:19,475 --> 00:19:21,208
All right.

343
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:25,846
OK, great. Uh, three-oh
Ethibond, please.

344
00:19:25,948 --> 00:19:28,777
Come on, come on, come on. Press
on the cricoid more. I can't see the cords.

345
00:19:28,801 --> 00:19:31,469
- Come on, Faz, stay with me!
- Kepner?

346
00:19:31,571 --> 00:19:34,604
His vitals started dropping.
X-rays were clear, no bullet,

347
00:19:34,707 --> 00:19:38,325
so I did an ultrasound,
found blood in the belly.

348
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:41,862
We need all available
surgical equipment, all right?

349
00:19:41,964 --> 00:19:44,632
Quickly. Good.

350
00:19:44,734 --> 00:19:47,418
Chief, you should stay in that
trauma room. There are no ORs.

351
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,848
- Get the chief an
anesthesiologist.
- What?

352
00:19:49,872 --> 00:19:53,974
I got a cop with blood in his belly. The
same cop that took down the shooter!

353
00:19:54,076 --> 00:19:56,521
You're saying I have to operate
on him in the trauma room?

354
00:19:56,545 --> 00:19:58,663
I'm saying it's your
best option right now.

355
00:19:58,765 --> 00:20:00,459
Sir, his pressure's dropping!

356
00:20:00,483 --> 00:20:02,761
Hunt, I hope you know
what you're doing, Hunt.

357
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:04,268
Yes, sir. So do I.

358
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:07,305
Kepner, lock him down in there and
get me a major procedures tray now.

359
00:20:07,407 --> 00:20:09,974
- OK.
- Avery, is Altman done yet?

360
00:20:10,076 --> 00:20:12,993
No. And while we've got a
cop bleeding out down here,

361
00:20:13,095 --> 00:20:15,874
she's occupying a perfectly good
OR, going to extreme measures

362
00:20:15,898 --> 00:20:18,633
to save the damn shooter.
I tried talking to her...

363
00:20:18,735 --> 00:20:21,785
Altman's guy is the shooter?
Does Cristina know that?

364
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,321
- Yeah, so does Altman! I walked out.
- All right.

365
00:20:24,423 --> 00:20:26,624
Go to the emergency
room. There is incoming.

366
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:28,837
Kepner, I need you to
go to Outpatient Recovery!

367
00:20:28,861 --> 00:20:30,305
I need to get these
supplies to the chief.

368
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:32,563
No. You, take this to
the chief in trauma one.

369
00:20:32,665 --> 00:20:35,143
Go to Outpatient Recovery
right now and oversee it.

370
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:36,945
- What am I doing?
- It's like
a mobile trauma unit.

371
00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:38,781
It's like a MASH unit.
I'll be there in a moment.

372
00:20:38,805 --> 00:20:41,689
- Wait! Where are you going?
- You were trained
for this, Kepner!

373
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:44,224
- Oversee it!
- Oh, God.

374
00:20:44,327 --> 00:20:46,293
OK, coming through.

375
00:20:49,482 --> 00:20:52,616
- I understand why
you're mad at me.
- No.

376
00:20:52,718 --> 00:20:54,718
I even understand you
slamming the door in my face.

377
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:57,938
No! You will not hold me
hostage and make me listen to you.

378
00:20:58,041 --> 00:21:00,674
I am rebuilding the leg
of a kid who's been shot.

379
00:21:00,776 --> 00:21:04,295
That's... That's why I'm
here, that is the only reason.

380
00:21:05,247 --> 00:21:08,048
No talking. None.

381
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:35,342
OK, if anyone's free, we
have an incoming patient.

382
00:21:35,444 --> 00:21:38,044
GSW to the flank with
active hemorrhage.

383
00:21:38,146 --> 00:21:42,516
Why are we still accepting
critical cases? I'm coming, Kepner!

384
00:21:42,618 --> 00:21:47,888
Continue to debride out the devitalized
tissue and repair the injured vessel.

385
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:49,389
You're serious?

386
00:21:49,491 --> 00:21:52,326
Do you want to take the
incoming GSW to the flank?

387
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:54,094
All right, then.

388
00:21:54,196 --> 00:21:56,397
Um, there's enough
surgeons around

389
00:21:56,499 --> 00:22:00,918
- if you have questions. Just take care of Chuck.
- OK, Chuck.

390
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:06,440
I'm gonna be doing a vascular
repair on you, in a freakin' mosh pit.

391
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:18,835
- Son of a bitch.
- ICP is still 45.

392
00:22:18,937 --> 00:22:20,904
His brain is still swelling.

393
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:22,534
We're gonna have to
remove the other side.

394
00:22:22,558 --> 00:22:23,836
You're gonna take off
both sides of his skull?

395
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:25,320
We're gonna leave this
strip here that covers up

396
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:27,722
the superior sagittal sinus.
Let's get the other side prepped.

397
00:22:27,746 --> 00:22:29,491
Well, I'm gonna
go update the wife.

398
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:32,327
Since when are you so interested in
updating the wife in the waiting room

399
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:36,554
- than doing this?
- Since I was the wife
in the waiting room, Derek!

400
00:22:36,656 --> 00:22:39,034
Honestly, do you think you
and Cristina are the only two

401
00:22:39,058 --> 00:22:41,153
- who have ever
been through a trauma?
- Do not bring Cristina

402
00:22:41,177 --> 00:22:43,522
back into this. You don't get to
act like a spoiled little brat in my OR.

403
00:22:43,546 --> 00:22:47,059
Why is it OK for Cristina to do whatever
she wants, but it's not OK for me?

404
00:22:47,083 --> 00:22:49,483
Because I'm not hiding
under OR tables or bartending?

405
00:22:49,518 --> 00:22:51,785
- Meredith.
- Honestly, you and Cristina

406
00:22:51,887 --> 00:22:53,954
are so busy
supporting each other,

407
00:22:54,056 --> 00:22:56,774
have you even noticed that I
went through a trauma, too?

408
00:22:58,911 --> 00:23:02,329
I was the wife in the waiting room,
Derek, and it's so hard to be the wife

409
00:23:02,431 --> 00:23:05,343
in the waiting room. So
hard that I walked into the OR,

410
00:23:05,367 --> 00:23:07,996
while the shooter had a gun to
you, and told him to shoot me instead.

411
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:10,199
That's how hard it is to be
the wife in the waiting room.

412
00:23:10,223 --> 00:23:12,663
Excuse me. I'm gonna
go update my patient.

413
00:23:21,634 --> 00:23:24,518
OK. OK.

414
00:23:26,021 --> 00:23:29,957
I'm sorry. Let's continue on.

415
00:23:40,135 --> 00:23:43,970
Dr. Shepherd is going to remove
the other half of your husband's skull.

416
00:23:44,073 --> 00:23:47,591
If all goes well in the OR,
he'll then freeze the skull

417
00:23:47,693 --> 00:23:50,639
to keep the bones from dying,
then he'll sew the scalp and muscle

418
00:23:50,663 --> 00:23:53,107
- back over the exposed brain.
- I don't understand. I'm sorry.

419
00:23:53,131 --> 00:23:57,701
- I don't understand.
- I know it sounds frightening
and extreme, and it is.

420
00:23:57,804 --> 00:24:00,570
But Dr. Shepherd is very good.

421
00:24:00,673 --> 00:24:03,507
And I'll come out and
keep you posted, OK?

422
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:06,242
- OK...
- OK.

423
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,847
I'm looking for
the Sackett family.

424
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:12,165
Anybody here for a John Sackett?

425
00:24:12,268 --> 00:24:15,352
Excuse me, is anyone
here related to Jared Swork?

426
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:18,906
Yes! That's my son!
How is he? Is he OK?

427
00:24:19,008 --> 00:24:21,441
Ma'am, would you
mind coming with me?

428
00:24:24,213 --> 00:24:26,373
- Over there.
- Thanks, man.

429
00:24:27,499 --> 00:24:32,302
My son was shot!
He wasn't the shooter!

430
00:24:32,404 --> 00:24:36,206
No! No, my son didn't do this!

431
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:39,376
No, no, no!

432
00:24:48,454 --> 00:24:50,537
- What the hell?
- Sloan, move on.

433
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:52,233
- I'm gonna kick your ass.
- Kick it later.

434
00:24:52,257 --> 00:24:54,538
We got a kid in three
with a GSW to the shoulder

435
00:24:54,593 --> 00:24:56,638
and we need this
space for incoming.

436
00:24:56,662 --> 00:24:59,096
My name's not going on this
chart. That's a hack job you did.

437
00:24:59,198 --> 00:25:00,775
Somebody get
Dr. Nelson here now!

438
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,945
- I'll get Grey, you get bed three.
- - Clean it and wrap it.

439
00:25:02,969 --> 00:25:05,402
Right away, doctor.

440
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:10,040
She's got an intracranial
hemorrhage, her pupil just blew.

441
00:25:10,142 --> 00:25:12,209
She needs burr holes
and a... and a trauma flap.

442
00:25:12,311 --> 00:25:15,746
- We gotta evacuate that clot.
- OK, we can do that.

443
00:25:15,848 --> 00:25:17,128
We can do that.

444
00:25:18,084 --> 00:25:19,216
OK.

445
00:25:26,675 --> 00:25:31,045
- I need some hands over here, Avery.
- - Yep.

446
00:25:31,147 --> 00:25:34,148
- Arterial repair. Can you hold that?
- Got it.

447
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:35,882
You know Altman's
still in OR one?

448
00:25:35,985 --> 00:25:38,385
So, you can't
choose who you save.

449
00:25:38,487 --> 00:25:40,154
Yeah, that's
apparently the party line.

450
00:25:40,256 --> 00:25:43,857
The shooter's sick. Nobody
does this in their right mind.

451
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:45,459
What's your point?

452
00:25:45,561 --> 00:25:48,929
My brother just had a psychotic
break and tried to kill my sister.

453
00:25:49,031 --> 00:25:52,232
And if he got hurt, even if
he got hurt hurting people,

454
00:25:52,334 --> 00:25:54,712
I would want his doctors to do
everything they could to save him.

455
00:25:54,736 --> 00:25:57,520
No matter what he did,
he's still my little brother.

456
00:26:00,425 --> 00:26:02,893
Making the incision.

457
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:06,847
- Ready with the drill?
- Yeah.

458
00:26:12,421 --> 00:26:15,606
- No, you're gonna do it.
- Mark.

459
00:26:15,708 --> 00:26:19,910
She's your patient, Dr. Grey.
You're gonna save her life.

460
00:26:20,446 --> 00:26:22,129
Ready?

461
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:27,867
Gently.

462
00:26:27,969 --> 00:26:29,769
Right there.

463
00:26:30,405 --> 00:26:33,157
Perfect. Perfect.

464
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:37,861
Damn it! He's crashing! I
need a crash cart in here now!

465
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:47,704
Hey, do not die,
Chuck! You hear me?

466
00:26:47,806 --> 00:26:51,392
That shooter does not get
to win this. You come back!

467
00:26:51,494 --> 00:26:53,593
Here we go!

468
00:26:53,996 --> 00:26:56,230
Clear!

469
00:26:56,332 --> 00:26:59,083
- Come on.
- Uh...

470
00:26:59,185 --> 00:27:02,502
Come back right now, Charles!

471
00:27:02,604 --> 00:27:05,772
- Come back to your body,
right now!
- Clear!

472
00:27:11,663 --> 00:27:16,566
You bastard! You better
send this boy back right now!

473
00:27:16,668 --> 00:27:18,252
Clear!

474
00:27:30,015 --> 00:27:33,116
Sorry about the "bastard" thing.

475
00:27:51,102 --> 00:27:53,036
There's something
you need to see.

476
00:28:29,892 --> 00:28:32,159
What is that?

477
00:28:33,061 --> 00:28:36,429
The Pacific College Alma Mater.

478
00:29:09,932 --> 00:29:13,099
Thank you for
staying today, Cristina.

479
00:29:14,303 --> 00:29:17,404
I know it can't have
been an easy decision.

480
00:29:23,144 --> 00:29:24,744
You know what, though?

481
00:29:26,514 --> 00:29:28,248
It was.

482
00:29:36,508 --> 00:29:41,845
- How is he?
- He's decompressed,
but he's got a bad contusion.

483
00:29:44,049 --> 00:29:47,284
Damn it. He's bleeding
too much. Vascular clips.

484
00:30:18,951 --> 00:30:21,029
She is right there.

485
00:30:21,053 --> 00:30:24,838
- Mrs. Sturgeon,
I'm Dr. Shepherd.
- Hi.

486
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:28,525
Hi. Your husband is in a
medically induced coma.

487
00:30:28,627 --> 00:30:30,888
He'll have to stay that
way until his brain heals.

488
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:34,292
Hopefully, in a couple of weeks,
we'll be able to replace the skull,

489
00:30:34,316 --> 00:30:38,401
- and wake him up.
- Wait, you're
saying that he lived?

490
00:30:39,705 --> 00:30:44,074
- That he's alive?
- We have a long road
ahead of us.

491
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:47,776
But yes, he is alive. And I
can take you to him if you'd like.

492
00:30:49,798 --> 00:30:51,125
- OK.
- OK.

493
00:30:51,149 --> 00:30:52,832
- OK.
- OK?

494
00:30:54,436 --> 00:30:56,436
Oh! Thank you.

495
00:30:56,538 --> 00:31:00,540
It's OK. You can see him
in a few minutes, all right?

496
00:31:08,683 --> 00:31:12,819
Excuse me, ma'am. Has anyone
talked to you about your son?

497
00:31:12,921 --> 00:31:20,293
The police questioned me for hours,
as if I should have known something.

498
00:31:20,395 --> 00:31:25,231
They found a suicide
note in his jeans.

499
00:31:26,434 --> 00:31:29,369
And I didn't know anything.

500
00:31:30,456 --> 00:31:33,272
My whole life...

501
00:31:33,375 --> 00:31:38,378
Everything... I
ever knew... is a lie.

502
00:31:42,818 --> 00:31:46,019
He's my baby.

503
00:31:46,121 --> 00:31:50,624
All I want to know
is if he's alive.

504
00:31:50,726 --> 00:31:52,476
Is that terrible?

505
00:31:53,311 --> 00:31:55,995
All these people he hurt...

506
00:31:57,549 --> 00:32:00,934
Does that make
me a terrible person?

507
00:32:05,374 --> 00:32:09,643
Your son was shot in the chest.

508
00:32:10,662 --> 00:32:13,696
Dr. Altman, who is a
very good heart surgeon,

509
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:15,832
is doing everything
that she can.

510
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:19,652
She's still in surgery,
which means he's still alive.

511
00:32:21,256 --> 00:32:25,608
She'll come find you as
soon as she's out. OK?

512
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:28,862
OK. Thank you.

513
00:32:29,398 --> 00:32:30,863
Thank you.

514
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:49,365
- He's fine.
- Oh, God!

515
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:52,652
- Oh, my God. You kidding me?
- It was touch
and go for a while,

516
00:32:52,754 --> 00:32:56,873
- but he's gonna be fine.
- Thank you.

517
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:59,843
Thank you.

518
00:33:01,347 --> 00:33:05,748
And, um... let's stop
meeting like this, Marty.

519
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:07,768
Oh, please, God.

520
00:33:09,087 --> 00:33:10,437
Please, God.

521
00:33:24,018 --> 00:33:28,338
This is... This is a huge victory. You
know, whatever else happened today,

522
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,273
we work together well.

523
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:31,574
So, thank you.

524
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:34,110
Thank you for coming
when I asked you to come,

525
00:33:34,212 --> 00:33:37,980
and for fighting Stark
with me. Thank you.

526
00:33:42,921 --> 00:33:46,038
- Calliope.
- Hm?

527
00:33:56,301 --> 00:34:00,370
I am so deeply,

528
00:34:00,472 --> 00:34:03,806
deeply, deeply sorry

529
00:34:03,909 --> 00:34:08,111
for hurting you so
much. I am so sorry.

530
00:34:08,213 --> 00:34:11,147
Because I am so
in love with you.

531
00:34:11,232 --> 00:34:14,867
And I will spend the rest
of my life telling you that.

532
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:18,872
I'll apologize to you every
day if that's what you need.

533
00:34:18,974 --> 00:34:21,007
But please...

534
00:34:21,943 --> 00:34:25,328
Please don't walk away again.

535
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:30,867
I came across the world
to be with you. I love you.

536
00:34:32,871 --> 00:34:34,237
Please.

537
00:34:34,323 --> 00:34:37,368
You had to fly across the
world to get to me, Arizona,

538
00:34:37,392 --> 00:34:41,144
because you flew a whole world
away without looking back. You just left.

539
00:34:42,564 --> 00:34:45,131
And this might be news
to you. I think it kind of is.

540
00:34:45,234 --> 00:34:49,803
But you're not the only one in this
relationship. There are two of us.

541
00:34:49,905 --> 00:34:54,674
And you came back
today, but I didn't.

542
00:34:54,776 --> 00:35:00,229
Whatever else happened,
that... that hasn't changed.

543
00:35:16,497 --> 00:35:18,080
Hey.

544
00:35:19,083 --> 00:35:20,277
You...

545
00:35:20,301 --> 00:35:24,521
You've been holding
everybody up, even though...

546
00:35:24,623 --> 00:35:28,257
You amaze me.

547
00:35:33,982 --> 00:35:35,882
Mm...

548
00:35:38,036 --> 00:35:41,170
I know you're mad at me
for taking Cristina fishing.

549
00:35:41,272 --> 00:35:43,807
And I know you
think it didn't work.

550
00:35:44,843 --> 00:35:46,876
I just heard she's in OR one.

551
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:52,298
- What?
- She's here.

552
00:36:42,868 --> 00:36:46,569
I just took my kid to a
room. He was the last one.

553
00:36:46,671 --> 00:36:50,190
- Besides this one.
- Mm-hm. Yeah, besides this one.

554
00:36:51,943 --> 00:36:55,895
- Thirty-seven degrees.
- Should be any minute now.

555
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:37,737
We saw 26 patients.

556
00:37:39,824 --> 00:37:42,258
Twenty-six victims.

557
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:45,127
And we had no casualties.

558
00:37:46,164 --> 00:37:48,264
No one died.

559
00:38:35,397 --> 00:38:37,463
I hate this place.

560
00:38:48,343 --> 00:38:50,276
<i>Surgery is extreme.</i>

561
00:38:50,378 --> 00:38:53,379
<i>We cut into your
body, take out pieces</i>

562
00:38:53,498 --> 00:38:55,798
<i>and put what's
left back together.</i>

563
00:38:56,468 --> 00:38:58,634
I was holding a grudge.

564
00:38:58,737 --> 00:39:00,570
I can hire you back.

565
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:02,792
But you're gonna have
to work under Stark.

566
00:39:32,954 --> 00:39:35,621
- Hey.
- Hey.

567
00:39:35,723 --> 00:39:39,225
She's, uh, still sedated.
And she's just a kid.

568
00:39:39,327 --> 00:39:42,761
She shouldn't
have a big ugly scar.

569
00:39:42,864 --> 00:39:47,433
Do you mind waiting?
I'll be about another hour.

570
00:39:50,071 --> 00:39:52,205
I love you.

571
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,044
So... yeah.

572
00:39:58,146 --> 00:40:00,947
Just, uh, take your time.

573
00:40:01,049 --> 00:40:04,517
I, um... I'll wait.

574
00:40:08,322 --> 00:40:10,657
<i>Good thing life doesn't
come with a scalpel,</i>

575
00:40:10,759 --> 00:40:14,477
<i>because if it did, when
things started to hurt,</i>

576
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:18,113
<i>we would just cut
and cut and cut.</i>

577
00:40:18,215 --> 00:40:21,551
Hey, I'm really sorry I'm late.

578
00:40:23,054 --> 00:40:24,420
You look exhausted.

579
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:28,808
You look exhausted.
I look handsome.

580
00:40:31,179 --> 00:40:32,611
How about we get
you some insurance?

581
00:40:32,713 --> 00:40:34,931
Let's have a drink
first. Toast the day.

582
00:40:35,033 --> 00:40:37,344
- Henry...
- Because I've
never been married.

583
00:40:37,368 --> 00:40:41,120
- Have you?
- No. Um...

584
00:40:41,223 --> 00:40:43,055
But I wouldn't say
this is exactly...

585
00:40:43,157 --> 00:40:46,170
Look, I know what this is. But
I say we raise a glass anyway.

586
00:40:46,194 --> 00:40:50,179
There was no ring, right? No vows,
no photographer, no wedding cake,

587
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:53,883
which I was most disappointed
by because I love wedding cake.

588
00:40:55,103 --> 00:40:57,971
I think we can at least
have a toast, right?

589
00:40:58,073 --> 00:41:00,639
I spent the day in the OR

590
00:41:00,742 --> 00:41:04,276
saving someone who
really, really is, um...

591
00:41:06,014 --> 00:41:08,130
not a very good person.

592
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:14,254
Well, you saved me, too.

593
00:41:16,725 --> 00:41:18,469
You saved my life this morning.

594
00:41:18,493 --> 00:41:21,260
And that deserves a toast.

595
00:41:21,362 --> 00:41:23,562
Even if it wasn't
a real wedding.

596
00:41:24,265 --> 00:41:26,298
OK.

597
00:41:28,837 --> 00:41:30,870
OK.

598
00:41:44,035 --> 00:41:48,437
<i>The thing is, what we
take away with a scalpel...</i>

599
00:41:50,825 --> 00:41:52,625
<i>we can't ever get back.</i>

600
00:41:52,727 --> 00:41:54,610
You want to get a drink?

601
00:41:55,896 --> 00:41:57,780
Yeah. I do.

602
00:42:01,486 --> 00:42:04,531
Maybe not a real drink, actually,
because I'm trying to get pregnant

603
00:42:04,555 --> 00:42:10,193
and supposedly alcohol will make
my baby have three heads and 16 toes.

604
00:42:12,197 --> 00:42:14,375
Wanna get some crack cocaine?

605
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:16,933
<i>So, like I said...</i>

606
00:42:18,336 --> 00:42:19,735
<i>good thing.</i>
