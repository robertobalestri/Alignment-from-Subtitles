1
00:00:02,336 --> 00:00:04,736
<i>They say lightning
never strikes twice,</i>

2
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:06,621
<i>but that's a myth.</i>

3
00:00:10,461 --> 00:00:12,994
And it was so scary,

4
00:00:13,096 --> 00:00:15,764
seeing Derek lying on
the floor bleeding like that.

5
00:00:15,866 --> 00:00:18,484
So scary.

6
00:00:18,585 --> 00:00:21,105
It feels good just to,
you know, get that out,

7
00:00:21,172 --> 00:00:23,172
you know?

8
00:00:23,274 --> 00:00:26,041
Thank you.

9
00:00:26,143 --> 00:00:28,827
Thank you.

10
00:00:32,349 --> 00:00:34,533
I feel like I'm...

11
00:00:34,634 --> 00:00:37,001
ready to go back to work.

12
00:00:37,104 --> 00:00:39,488
<i>It doesn't happen often.</i>

13
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:41,589
<i>Lightning usually gets
it right the first time.</i>

14
00:00:41,692 --> 00:00:44,259
OK, let's, uh...

15
00:00:44,361 --> 00:00:46,528
talk more about that tomorrow.

16
00:00:50,868 --> 00:00:52,300
Come on.

17
00:00:53,903 --> 00:00:56,521
Do you need a tissue or...

18
00:00:56,624 --> 00:00:58,723
a hug or something?

19
00:00:58,825 --> 00:01:01,426
Go hug yourself.

20
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:10,385
<i>When you're hit with
30,000 amps of electricity,</i>

21
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:11,953
<i>you feel it.</i>

22
00:01:12,056 --> 00:01:13,588
Morning.

23
00:01:16,627 --> 00:01:18,327
Morning.

24
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,551
<i>It can make you
forget who you are.</i>

25
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:29,787
Just... just...

26
00:01:29,889 --> 00:01:32,440
stay calm. Breathe.
Take some deep breaths.

27
00:01:32,543 --> 00:01:35,443
We're... we're just married.

28
00:01:35,545 --> 00:01:38,479
And we're just gonna get
up and go to work like always.

29
00:01:38,582 --> 00:01:40,081
I've got this under control.

30
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:41,928
Now... now you need to
eat this, a little multigrain,

31
00:01:41,952 --> 00:01:43,535
and then we're just
gonna go to work.

32
00:01:43,637 --> 00:01:45,470
Work is what you
need right now, OK?

33
00:01:45,572 --> 00:01:48,189
We're gonna get a little
blood on those hands.

34
00:01:48,291 --> 00:01:51,260
That'll feel good. OK?
Let's just get up, get naked,

35
00:01:51,362 --> 00:01:54,295
get in the shower, have
a little morning soapy sex,

36
00:01:54,397 --> 00:01:56,164
then I'm gonna wash your hair.

37
00:01:56,266 --> 00:02:00,252
I've always wanted
to wash your hair.

38
00:02:04,407 --> 00:02:07,241
<i>It can burn you, blind
you, stop your heart...</i>

39
00:02:07,343 --> 00:02:09,995
Sounds big. I'm betting M.V.C.

40
00:02:10,097 --> 00:02:12,548
Multiple M.V.C. or
an apartment fire.

41
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:15,500
When is the staring gonna stop?

42
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:17,730
As soon as the novelty
wears off. Just Ignore them.

43
00:02:17,754 --> 00:02:19,387
Owen washed my hair.

44
00:02:19,489 --> 00:02:22,407
And he told me to
eat this grainy nut bar.

45
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:24,509
And he booked me
into surgery this morning.

46
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:26,689
He is in charge of me. I'm
a bride, and I'm going with it.

47
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:29,553
- Trauma guy didn't clear you.
- Yeah, but he said
he'll figure that out.

48
00:02:32,202 --> 00:02:35,103
Yes. OK, I am the crazy one.

49
00:02:35,205 --> 00:02:37,939
I am the one who freaks
out and screams at people...

50
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:39,424
like that.

51
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:43,244
Go gawk at each
other for a while.

52
00:02:44,865 --> 00:02:46,981
Are you OK?

53
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:50,852
Would everybody please just
stop asking if I am OK? OK?

54
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:54,388
<i>And cause massive
internal injuries.</i>

55
00:02:54,491 --> 00:02:56,424
He clear you yet?

56
00:02:56,526 --> 00:02:58,943
- No? Still?
- I resorted to tears.

57
00:02:59,045 --> 00:03:01,245
I wore bad mascara so
he wouldn't miss them.

58
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:04,416
- What... what did Derek say?
- Oh, I will be
avoiding him today.

59
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:05,611
So you don't have to talk
to him about the baby thing?

60
00:03:05,635 --> 00:03:08,036
No.

61
00:03:08,138 --> 00:03:10,422
Oh. Because you
left him in the pokey.

62
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:12,044
Yeah.

63
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:14,959
<i>But for something that
happens in only a millisecond...</i>

64
00:03:15,062 --> 00:03:16,428
Did you feel different?

65
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,241
You know, after you
scribbled on the Post-it?

66
00:03:18,265 --> 00:03:20,332
I mean, you're supposed
to feel different, right?

67
00:03:20,434 --> 00:03:24,252
- Well, it takes time. Give it some time.
- OK.

68
00:03:24,354 --> 00:03:26,449
I mean, your marriage is
filled with secrets and felons.

69
00:03:26,473 --> 00:03:28,167
I mean, why am I
asking your advice?

70
00:03:28,191 --> 00:03:29,858
<i>It can change your life forever.</i>

71
00:03:35,749 --> 00:03:37,627
Dr. Shepherd, the
chief is looking for you.

72
00:03:37,651 --> 00:03:38,717
I know.

73
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:40,463
- You missed the
wedding last night.
- I know.

74
00:03:40,487 --> 00:03:43,204
- You smell like pee.
- I know.

75
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:51,224
How was the wedding?

76
00:03:51,248 --> 00:03:52,625
It was fine. I'm
sorry you missed it.

77
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:54,950
Yeah, well, I was busy
getting an incarceration record.

78
00:03:55,052 --> 00:03:56,451
Do you know what that means?

79
00:03:56,553 --> 00:03:59,304
It means you drive
too fast. Oh, God.

80
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:02,507
- Derek, you smell like...
- Yeah, I know
what I smell like.

81
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:04,654
I have go to the pit.

82
00:04:04,678 --> 00:04:07,512
- They cleared you for surgery?
- No, but I can
still do consults.

83
00:04:07,614 --> 00:04:08,847
So sorry. Bye.

84
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:10,989
We're not done
talking about this.

85
00:04:11,017 --> 00:04:13,802
- - Oh, God. All
right. Did a bus crash?

86
00:04:13,904 --> 00:04:15,481
OK, I'm not
saying rip out walls.

87
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:16,916
I'm saying throw
some paint up on 'em.

88
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:18,818
You know, soften it up. Yang
decorated the place for her,

89
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:21,193
and it's just a little
harsh and frowny.

90
00:04:21,295 --> 00:04:23,227
Oh, OK. I'm gonna
stop you right there,

91
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:24,441
'cause Yang doesn't decorate.

92
00:04:24,465 --> 00:04:27,048
I decorated that place.
It's my frowny place.

93
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:28,933
I meant modern and edgy.

94
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:31,853
If it's gonna be our place,

95
00:04:31,955 --> 00:04:34,622
I just need it to be
a little more smiley.

96
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,658
Ugh. My God.

97
00:04:37,761 --> 00:04:40,478
I... Frowny?

98
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:43,397
Edgy.

99
00:04:43,499 --> 00:04:45,750
W... watch it!

100
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:47,419
Sorry.

101
00:04:47,521 --> 00:04:49,638
Karev?

102
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:52,073
Dr. Bailey?

103
00:04:52,192 --> 00:04:54,692
You still have that
bullet in your chest?

104
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:58,613
Uh, oh, yeah. It worked
its way to the surface.

105
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:00,715
It's fine. We leave bullets
in people all the time.

106
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:03,417
- It must hurt. Does it hurt?
- Uh, nope.

107
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:05,915
- Does it hurt
when I do this?
- Ow! Damn!

108
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:07,255
It is not fine.

109
00:05:07,357 --> 00:05:09,536
It is foreign, and it has no
business being in your body.

110
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,993
Get it out, Karev, or I'll see
to it that you won't operate

111
00:05:12,095 --> 00:05:13,911
until you're operated on.

112
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,516
Andrew Perkins
hasn't signed off on her.

113
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:19,851
You disagree with him?

114
00:05:19,953 --> 00:05:22,032
No. Keeping residents out
of the O.R. until they're ready

115
00:05:22,056 --> 00:05:24,956
is the right approach for most
of them, but not for Cristina.

116
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:27,620
She won't feel like herself
until she's back in surgery again.

117
00:05:27,644 --> 00:05:29,227
- You know Yang.
- I do.

118
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,930
And you want to start her on
an ex vivo heart reconstruction?

119
00:05:32,032 --> 00:05:33,343
This is a once-in-a-lifetime...

120
00:05:33,367 --> 00:05:34,627
It is a hell of a
lot of pressure

121
00:05:34,651 --> 00:05:36,534
- is what it is.
- Well, she operated on...

122
00:05:36,636 --> 00:05:39,237
I mean, she saved Derek
Shepherd with a gun to her head.

123
00:05:39,322 --> 00:05:41,523
I don't think that pressure
is the issue for her.

124
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:45,176
We owe her this,
Richard, and she needs it.

125
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:47,278
Put her back in the game.

126
00:05:49,365 --> 00:05:50,715
Linda Cotler, age 51,

127
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:52,862
has been here three
times in the last eight years

128
00:05:52,886 --> 00:05:54,786
for removal of malignant
myxomas from her heart.

129
00:05:54,888 --> 00:05:56,555
But we won't be
doing that again.

130
00:05:56,657 --> 00:05:58,956
No, by removing both atria,

131
00:05:59,042 --> 00:06:00,625
and hopefully all
the cancerous cells,

132
00:06:00,727 --> 00:06:02,494
you won't have to
keep coming back here.

133
00:06:02,596 --> 00:06:05,730
Hello, Dr. Yang. Nice
to see a familiar face.

134
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:07,727
Finally, someone we know.

135
00:06:07,751 --> 00:06:09,884
Mrs. Cotler was a
patient of Dr. Burke's.

136
00:06:09,986 --> 00:06:12,287
You assisted on her
last myxoma removal.

137
00:06:12,389 --> 00:06:13,622
Of course. Of course. Hi.

138
00:06:13,724 --> 00:06:16,185
- You were getting
married, weren't you?
- Sorry?

139
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,709
Well, got married. I
mean, last night, actually.

140
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:20,862
You and Dr. Burke?

141
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:23,042
- Sorry?
- - Last time we were here,

142
00:06:23,066 --> 00:06:26,401
- he said you two
were getting married.
- Oh, yes.

143
00:06:26,503 --> 00:06:30,154
No. That... that didn't happen.

144
00:06:30,257 --> 00:06:31,690
Oh.

145
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:35,227
What a shame. He went
on and on about you.

146
00:06:35,329 --> 00:06:36,994
But you did get married?

147
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:40,898
We did, last night. Yes, we did.

148
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,618
Oh.

149
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,987
Well, nice to see you again.

150
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:50,008
Well, uh, sit tight,

151
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:52,155
and we'll be back in with
some forms for you to sign,

152
00:06:52,179 --> 00:06:53,594
and then we'll take you up.

153
00:06:53,697 --> 00:06:57,866
Thanks, Dr. Altman, and
congratulations to you two.

154
00:06:57,968 --> 00:07:00,167
Thank you.

155
00:07:03,473 --> 00:07:04,667
OK, multiple burn victims.

156
00:07:04,691 --> 00:07:06,652
Two with paralysis,
three with vision loss,

157
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:09,344
one, uh, blown eardrums,
and one dislocated hip.

158
00:07:09,446 --> 00:07:10,328
House fire?

159
00:07:10,413 --> 00:07:11,540
- Explosion?
- Car wreck?

160
00:07:11,564 --> 00:07:13,026
- Uh, act of God.
- Act of God?

161
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:15,633
- Yeah, lightning strike.
- All that from one
lightning strike?

162
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:17,247
One lightning
strike, eight victims.

163
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:19,537
Took out a whole
flag football team.

164
00:07:29,983 --> 00:07:32,467
God was in a mood today.

165
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,766
How did it strike all of 'em?

166
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,469
Well, they're
mostly flash burns,

167
00:07:39,493 --> 00:07:40,603
so it probably hit one of them

168
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:42,460
then conducted
off onto the rest.

169
00:07:44,531 --> 00:07:46,431
Lexie.

170
00:07:46,533 --> 00:07:48,500
T.M. rupture, trauma one.

171
00:07:48,602 --> 00:07:50,918
I'll see you in there.

172
00:07:54,257 --> 00:07:55,574
Tell me something.

173
00:07:55,676 --> 00:07:57,603
When a person gets
out of the nut house...

174
00:07:57,627 --> 00:08:01,595
what's the appropriate amount of
time to wait before you propose?

175
00:08:01,697 --> 00:08:04,132
What? Long.

176
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:07,252
Longer. Long... A long time.

177
00:08:07,354 --> 00:08:09,120
Not now.

178
00:08:09,223 --> 00:08:10,621
Specifically, how long?

179
00:08:10,724 --> 00:08:12,423
Have you seen my friend Kerry?

180
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:14,270
She's... she's a girl.
Sh... she's the only girl.

181
00:08:14,294 --> 00:08:17,195
- Whoa. Whoa.
- You've just got
some ferning here.

182
00:08:17,297 --> 00:08:19,308
It's superficial. It's where
the electrons entered the skin.

183
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,749
Well, what about my arm?
I still can't feel my arm.

184
00:08:21,851 --> 00:08:23,350
- Sit forward.
- Hi.

185
00:08:23,453 --> 00:08:24,518
Uh, hi. You changed.

186
00:08:24,621 --> 00:08:26,821
Yeah, and showered,
twice, thanks to you.

187
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:28,200
- This is Russ.
- Uh-huh.

188
00:08:28,224 --> 00:08:29,635
He was struck by lightning
while playing flag football,

189
00:08:29,659 --> 00:08:31,779
and he's complaining of
paralysis in his left arm.

190
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:34,085
Can you move
your fingers for me?

191
00:08:35,398 --> 00:08:37,409
Yeah, see, I couldn't do
that when I first got here.

192
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:39,312
It's probably just
transitory paralysis,

193
00:08:39,336 --> 00:08:41,430
- which is common with lightning
strikes. Can you feel that?
- Little bit, yeah.

194
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:42,999
We're gonna keep watching you,

195
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:44,734
but your arm should come back
to normal in a couple of hours.

196
00:08:44,758 --> 00:08:46,469
You know they almost
revoked my driver's license?

197
00:08:46,493 --> 00:08:48,225
Can somebody please
check on Kerry for me?

198
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:52,446
- Happy to. Right away.
- Hey, we're still not done
talking about this.

199
00:08:52,548 --> 00:08:53,714
Mm.

200
00:08:53,816 --> 00:08:55,516
OK, wiggle your toes for me.

201
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:58,719
I still can't. Am I gonna
be in a wheelchair?

202
00:08:58,821 --> 00:09:01,106
We're gonna take
you in for a C.T.,

203
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:03,891
but hopefully, it is just
temporary, from the lightning.

204
00:09:03,993 --> 00:09:05,593
Couple of your
friends have it, too.

205
00:09:05,695 --> 00:09:08,446
- They're already starting
to get some feeling back.
- OK.

206
00:09:08,531 --> 00:09:11,394
- Try not to worry.
- Hey, Kerry. A friend
of yours, Russ Gammie,

207
00:09:11,418 --> 00:09:12,667
is asking about you.

208
00:09:12,769 --> 00:09:15,569
How's Warren Griffith? Is
he OK? Did he ask about me?

209
00:09:15,672 --> 00:09:17,989
- Which one is Warren?
- Excuse me. Excuse me. I...

210
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:20,085
- Who's this,
Russ or Warren?
- Mitch?

211
00:09:20,109 --> 00:09:21,349
Mitch now?

212
00:09:21,444 --> 00:09:23,310
Hey, have you seen
Warren? Is he OK?

213
00:09:23,412 --> 00:09:25,496
Kerry, I gotta say this.

214
00:09:25,598 --> 00:09:27,732
We both could've died out there.

215
00:09:27,834 --> 00:09:30,652
That lightning bolt was
like a one-in-a-million shot,

216
00:09:30,754 --> 00:09:33,120
so I gotta take one, too.

217
00:09:33,223 --> 00:09:36,223
I love you, Kerry, and
if we get through this,

218
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:38,109
I want you to know,

219
00:09:38,211 --> 00:09:40,344
I will love you forever.

220
00:09:43,133 --> 00:09:45,884
What?

221
00:09:45,986 --> 00:09:47,452
Wh...

222
00:09:47,554 --> 00:09:49,081
Sir, I'm sorry. If you're
not being treated,

223
00:09:49,105 --> 00:09:50,582
then you're gonna have
to go to the waiting room.

224
00:09:50,606 --> 00:09:53,591
- We'll... we'll keep you posted.
- Kerry, can you hear me?

225
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:55,109
Yeah, I can hear you fine.

226
00:09:55,211 --> 00:09:59,247
I just didn't want him
to know that I heard that.

227
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:00,615
You're a popular girl.

228
00:10:00,717 --> 00:10:03,217
No. I'm sure he's
just overexcited.

229
00:10:03,319 --> 00:10:05,853
It is like a
one-in-a-million thing.

230
00:10:05,955 --> 00:10:08,889
Actually, it's more like a
1-in-6,250 kind of thing.

231
00:10:08,991 --> 00:10:11,643
Lightning kills between
150 to 300 people every year

232
00:10:11,745 --> 00:10:14,562
- in the U.S. alone.
- Lexie.

233
00:10:14,664 --> 00:10:16,848
Well, no, I mean,
it's... it's still rare.

234
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,844
I mean, it's not, like,
say, handgun death.

235
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:21,936
- I mean, that's... that's 1 in 325.
- Lexie.

236
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:23,604
You OK?

237
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:25,435
Yeah. No, I'm saying...
I'm saying she's lucky.

238
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:29,110
That's... You
know, hey, yay, you.

239
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:31,257
Can someone just please
check on Warren for me?

240
00:10:31,281 --> 00:10:33,865
- I need to know if he's OK.
- Is Warren your boyfriend?

241
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:36,817
No. He's...

242
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,919
No.

243
00:10:39,021 --> 00:10:41,205
OK.

244
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:42,941
Well, you've got
two burst eardrums,

245
00:10:43,043 --> 00:10:45,455
- but they will
heal themselves, too.
- Great. Thank you.

246
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:47,273
Does that mean there's
no surgery? Can I go?

247
00:10:47,297 --> 00:10:49,580
'Cause Dr. Shepherd's here,
so he might have something.

248
00:10:49,682 --> 00:10:51,316
Maybe you should stick with me.

249
00:10:51,418 --> 00:10:54,786
Kerry will need a workup.

250
00:10:54,888 --> 00:10:57,672
I'm sorry. Why is this better
than what Dr. Burke did?

251
00:10:57,774 --> 00:11:02,043
Dr. Burke's approach was
conservative and correct

252
00:11:02,145 --> 00:11:03,305
for the first few surgeries.

253
00:11:03,379 --> 00:11:06,463
This is radical
and risky, but...

254
00:11:06,566 --> 00:11:08,044
Well, it sounds like
it's gonna kill her.

255
00:11:08,068 --> 00:11:10,651
Linda's heart wall has grown
weaker with every surgery,

256
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:13,755
so there are greater
odds of cardiac rupture.

257
00:11:13,857 --> 00:11:15,500
This may be her last chance.

258
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:20,494
Paul... Honey, every two years,

259
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:22,463
we come here, they cut me open,

260
00:11:22,565 --> 00:11:25,950
and I watch it take ten
years off of your life.

261
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:28,219
I can't do it anymore.

262
00:11:28,321 --> 00:11:29,837
And neither can you.

263
00:11:32,976 --> 00:11:34,275
What about you?

264
00:11:34,377 --> 00:11:37,011
Do you think this
is the best idea?

265
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:38,813
Oh, I'm not, um...

266
00:11:38,915 --> 00:11:41,332
Because what you
and Dr. Burke did,

267
00:11:41,435 --> 00:11:43,735
it's kept her with me so far.

268
00:11:43,837 --> 00:11:47,972
If this was your husband,
would you let Dr. Altman

269
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:50,875
tear apart his heart?

270
00:11:55,198 --> 00:11:56,530
Yes.

271
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:59,083
An aggressive approach
is your only option.

272
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:00,952
This is what you want.

273
00:12:09,512 --> 00:12:11,079
OK.

274
00:12:11,181 --> 00:12:13,480
All right.

275
00:12:13,582 --> 00:12:15,049
OK.

276
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:17,601
We'll see you in there.

277
00:12:20,357 --> 00:12:22,740
Mm.

278
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:25,326
Oh. What are these?

279
00:12:25,428 --> 00:12:26,689
Choices.

280
00:12:26,713 --> 00:12:28,146
They're all beige.

281
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:30,047
No, they're all subtle.

282
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:32,583
Look, pastels and earth tones.

283
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:36,554
If you look closely, that's
blue, that's green, that's yellow...

284
00:12:36,656 --> 00:12:39,023
to take the edge off all
the chrome and concrete.

285
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:42,643
- What do you think?
- I think I don't want to live
in an Easter basket.

286
00:12:42,745 --> 00:12:44,290
I know. You really want
to live in the Batcave.

287
00:12:44,314 --> 00:12:48,082
- But meet me halfway.
- Uh, yes.

288
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:51,002
Schultz, Kerry? Yes, thank you.

289
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:53,537
OK, uh, my patient's
scans are up.

290
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,040
And, uh, seriously...

291
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:57,842
they're all beige to me.

292
00:12:57,944 --> 00:13:01,746
W... well, then it shouldn't
be hard to pick one.

293
00:13:01,848 --> 00:13:03,247
I'm looking for Warren Griffith.

294
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:04,849
That's me.

295
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:06,884
Oh. I feel kind of queasy.

296
00:13:06,987 --> 00:13:09,003
You've got a little
fever. That may be why.

297
00:13:09,105 --> 00:13:10,871
You got hit the hardest.
Looks like it went

298
00:13:10,973 --> 00:13:12,318
into your neck and
came out your foot.

299
00:13:12,342 --> 00:13:13,841
And you're saying
it bounced off me

300
00:13:13,944 --> 00:13:16,527
and hit everyone else? I
took out the whole team?

301
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:17,929
It's not like it's your fault.

302
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:21,499
It kinda feels that way. I
don't remember any of it.

303
00:13:21,601 --> 00:13:23,233
How about my friend
Kerry? Is she OK?

304
00:13:23,336 --> 00:13:24,936
She's wondering the
same thing about you.

305
00:13:24,987 --> 00:13:27,822
She what? She asked about me?

306
00:13:27,924 --> 00:13:30,308
Specifically?

307
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:32,376
Well, what did she say?

308
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,190
Are you people in junior high?

309
00:13:34,214 --> 00:13:36,480
I almost told
her. I tried to. I...

310
00:13:36,582 --> 00:13:39,250
- I'm gonna tell her.
- What are you talking about?

311
00:13:39,352 --> 00:13:41,869
Kerry. I tried to tell her
I... I love her, but her...

312
00:13:41,971 --> 00:13:43,882
- Her ears are
all messed up and...
- Ah!

313
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:45,884
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. You gotta sit down.
- Where are you going?

314
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:48,543
- I gotta tell her. I get to tell her.
- Guys, look,

315
00:13:48,644 --> 00:13:51,006
leave her alone. All right?
She coulda died out there.

316
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:54,816
And besides, she's, like, mine.

317
00:13:54,918 --> 00:13:56,495
No, I've been working
up to this for a year.

318
00:13:56,519 --> 00:13:58,363
No, no, no, you've gotta sit.

319
00:13:58,387 --> 00:14:00,265
- She's mine, and I love her.
- I've been working up
to this for a year.

320
00:14:00,289 --> 00:14:02,868
- You need to come back here and sit down!
- Popular girl.

321
00:14:02,892 --> 00:14:04,575
Oh, my God. Thank you.

322
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:07,072
Yep, C.T. looks clear.
No damage to your spine.

323
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:08,295
Which means I can go?

324
00:14:08,397 --> 00:14:09,747
It means you should observe her.

325
00:14:11,935 --> 00:14:15,536
Whoa. Hey!

326
00:14:15,638 --> 00:14:18,889
Guys, you can't be in here.

327
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:22,043
Everybody, shut up. Shut up.

328
00:14:25,148 --> 00:14:27,682
OK, Warren. You talk.

329
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:29,149
Oh.

330
00:14:29,251 --> 00:14:33,471
Kerry, I...

331
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,693
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

332
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:43,197
Page Bailey!

333
00:14:44,684 --> 00:14:46,751
Warren, you have a perforation,

334
00:14:46,853 --> 00:14:48,397
a hole, somewhere in your bowel.

335
00:14:48,421 --> 00:14:51,067
- We're gonna have to take you
up to surgery.
- Tell Kerry I'm sorry.

336
00:14:51,091 --> 00:14:54,241
- Tell her I'm sorry
I hit her with lightning.
- Hey, don't you worry.

337
00:14:54,343 --> 00:14:56,995
No, she's just the sweetest,
funniest... She's just...

338
00:14:57,097 --> 00:15:00,781
- Please make sure she's OK.
- OK. We will. We're gonna
take care of you now.

339
00:15:00,883 --> 00:15:02,967
All right, who do I
have? Who's free?

340
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:05,920
- I'm free. I'm good. I'll go.
- He's my patient. I'll take him.

341
00:15:07,423 --> 00:15:09,235
- Ow!
- Book an O.R. You can observe.

342
00:15:09,259 --> 00:15:12,543
- I'm fine, and I'm free.
- Oh...

343
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:15,329
- B... What are you doing?
- Nothing.

344
00:15:15,431 --> 00:15:17,660
Other Grey, are
you free to scrub in?

345
00:15:17,684 --> 00:15:20,134
- Absolutely. I...
- I'm available,

346
00:15:20,236 --> 00:15:21,998
'cause you haven't been
cleared for surgery, right?

347
00:15:22,022 --> 00:15:24,333
April, if we're
gonna be friends,

348
00:15:24,357 --> 00:15:26,991
- you have to stop doing that.
- Sorry. Habit.

349
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:29,727
- I'm standing right here.
- Kepner, go prep him.

350
00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:32,279
- OK.
- I'll see you up there.

351
00:15:32,381 --> 00:15:34,214
I'm fine.

352
00:15:34,316 --> 00:15:37,151
Well, great. Then you
can keep an eye on Kerry.

353
00:15:37,253 --> 00:15:39,604
I'll resect both atria

354
00:15:39,706 --> 00:15:43,074
and build new ones out
of bovine pericardium.

355
00:15:43,175 --> 00:15:45,225
And during reconstruction,

356
00:15:45,327 --> 00:15:49,129
Dr. Hunt will stay with Linda,
using a human donor aorta

357
00:15:49,232 --> 00:15:51,199
to prepare the vessels
for reimplantation.

358
00:15:51,301 --> 00:15:52,995
And all of this in
just four hours?

359
00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:56,604
We have to be fast. We all set?

360
00:15:56,706 --> 00:15:57,805
Let's go.

361
00:15:57,907 --> 00:16:00,274
All right. Prep her and
page me when she's ready.

362
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:06,313
Cristina.

363
00:16:06,415 --> 00:16:08,616
Are you excited?

364
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:10,117
Yes, absolutely.

365
00:16:10,236 --> 00:16:11,953
Good. Good.

366
00:16:21,848 --> 00:16:25,716
The fear of going back in is
worse than actually doing it.

367
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:29,120
It's just getting back
on the horse is all it is.

368
00:16:40,967 --> 00:16:43,300
This is one hell of
a honeymoon, right?

369
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,575
Incision looks great.

370
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:54,195
Hey, I hear you and
Torres are shacking up.

371
00:16:54,297 --> 00:16:55,980
Uh, uh, yeah.

372
00:16:56,082 --> 00:16:58,432
Do I sound more
excited than you?

373
00:16:58,534 --> 00:17:00,701
No, no. I am. I am.

374
00:17:00,803 --> 00:17:04,922
How's it going with the
hot, hot trauma counselor?

375
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,957
I have to say...

376
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:08,476
it's great.

377
00:17:08,578 --> 00:17:10,489
The conversation never stops,

378
00:17:10,513 --> 00:17:14,047
and I feel, um...

379
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:15,716
I don't know.

380
00:17:15,818 --> 00:17:18,151
I feel good whenever I see him.

381
00:17:18,253 --> 00:17:19,821
No heart murmur. Good girl.

382
00:17:19,923 --> 00:17:22,289
What do you talk
about? What's he like?

383
00:17:22,391 --> 00:17:25,643
He's, um... Well,
he likes to, uh...

384
00:17:25,745 --> 00:17:28,712
I guess I... I mostly talk,

385
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:31,582
and he mostly listens.

386
00:17:31,684 --> 00:17:34,602
He's... he's an
amazingly good listener.

387
00:17:34,704 --> 00:17:37,672
Well, he should be. It's
what he gets paid for.

388
00:17:37,774 --> 00:17:40,124
Yeah.

389
00:17:43,579 --> 00:17:45,028
Warren?

390
00:17:45,131 --> 00:17:46,814
You love Warren?

391
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:48,466
Warren's bald, Kerry.

392
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:50,651
I know that, Mitch.

393
00:17:53,673 --> 00:17:55,756
You guys don't love me.

394
00:17:55,858 --> 00:17:58,008
I'm a girl who's down
with flag football,

395
00:17:58,111 --> 00:18:00,278
so you think you love me.

396
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:03,381
Plus, we got
struck by lightning,

397
00:18:03,483 --> 00:18:04,483
so that's...

398
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:06,950
Nice. You made her cry.

399
00:18:07,052 --> 00:18:08,986
Oh, crap. You know, sorry.

400
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,832
You know, Warren's a good guy.

401
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:13,590
He could probably get a
hairpiece or something and...

402
00:18:13,692 --> 00:18:16,143
She's crying because
everything's changed.

403
00:18:16,245 --> 00:18:19,413
OK? Lightning struck,
and everything changed.

404
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:20,881
You were her team.

405
00:18:20,983 --> 00:18:23,551
She was one of you,
and... and now you're just...

406
00:18:23,653 --> 00:18:25,186
you're looking
at her differently.

407
00:18:28,374 --> 00:18:30,190
Um, no.

408
00:18:30,292 --> 00:18:34,828
I'm crying because I'm
worried about Warren.

409
00:18:36,131 --> 00:18:37,231
Oh.

410
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:39,567
Could you please
find out if he's OK?

411
00:18:47,076 --> 00:18:49,276
<i>- $550.
- "N"...</i>

412
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:50,378
Really?

413
00:18:50,446 --> 00:18:52,324
This is what I'm cleared to do.

414
00:18:52,348 --> 00:18:54,359
- I'm cleared
to solve this puzzle.
<i>- Buy an "I".</i>

415
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:57,051
Don't buy a vowel, you idiot.

416
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:00,321
Scarlet Pimpernel.

417
00:19:02,825 --> 00:19:05,025
How did you...

418
00:19:05,127 --> 00:19:06,755
There was one "C" and an "M".

419
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:08,796
Have you talked to
Derek yet about the...

420
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:10,831
Today's not the day.

421
00:19:10,934 --> 00:19:13,267
Right. He just
got out of the joint.

422
00:19:13,369 --> 00:19:15,353
Let him ease back into society.

423
00:19:15,455 --> 00:19:16,904
You ready?

424
00:19:17,023 --> 00:19:19,573
- You up for this?
- Up for what?

425
00:19:19,675 --> 00:19:22,143
Teddy's rebuilding
a woman's atrium

426
00:19:22,245 --> 00:19:25,363
- out of a sack of cow meat.
- But you're not nervous at all?

427
00:19:25,465 --> 00:19:28,799
You're lucky. I get to watch
an intestinal perf repair.

428
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:31,963
- Bailey won't let me operate
till I get this bullet out.
- I'll take it out.

429
00:19:31,987 --> 00:19:35,038
- I'll cut it out right now.
- You sound like a junkie.

430
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:37,041
What the hell is a pimpernel?

431
00:19:37,143 --> 00:19:39,343
Kerry wants to know
how Warren's doing.

432
00:19:39,445 --> 00:19:41,885
Intestinal perf.
Going to surgery.

433
00:19:43,398 --> 00:19:45,332
I'm never gonna operate again.

434
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:47,768
Everyone thinks I'm gonna
carve my initials into a patient.

435
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:50,649
I'll never operate again
because one man thinks I'm crazy.

436
00:19:50,673 --> 00:19:52,473
Hey, guys, look
at this. Look at this.

437
00:19:52,508 --> 00:19:54,285
<i>A bystander's cell phone
captured the shocking end</i>

438
00:19:54,309 --> 00:19:57,395
<i>to a flag football practice
in Lawton Park this morning.</i>

439
00:19:57,497 --> 00:19:58,946
- Oh!
- Oh! Oh, my...

440
00:19:59,048 --> 00:20:01,260
- Ooh.
<i>- We've got that</i>
<i>amazing footage,</i>

441
00:20:01,284 --> 00:20:03,284
<i>plus all your news
traffic and weather,</i>

442
00:20:03,352 --> 00:20:06,887
<i>- coming up after this.</i>
- Oh, my God. She never
saw it coming.

443
00:20:06,989 --> 00:20:08,756
No. No.

444
00:20:08,858 --> 00:20:11,025
No, no, no.

445
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:14,228
50 says she back in the
cuckoo's nest by lunch.

446
00:20:19,769 --> 00:20:21,468
Hey, how was your night in jail?

447
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:23,203
You shank someone
right off the bat?

448
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:25,383
You gotta let the other cons
know not to mess with you.

449
00:20:25,407 --> 00:20:26,607
That's not funny.

450
00:20:26,709 --> 00:20:28,487
They almost charged me
with reckless endangerment.

451
00:20:28,511 --> 00:20:30,277
I'm sorry. What?

452
00:20:30,379 --> 00:20:31,824
You mean that's where
you've been all morning,

453
00:20:31,848 --> 00:20:34,848
- in jail for reckless
endangerment?
- Nobody was endangered.

454
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:37,134
I can't have this,
Derek. I won't. Now...

455
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,981
Have you ever been over
120 miles an hour before?

456
00:20:39,005 --> 00:20:41,939
Richard, have you ever
been over 80? It's fun.

457
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:43,952
It's really fun. I mean,
especially when you go

458
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:45,954
through a corner like
that at that speed, and...

459
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:48,123
and you're not sure if the
rear end's gonna stick or not,

460
00:20:48,147 --> 00:20:49,758
and you lose control, and
then you put the throttle down,

461
00:20:49,782 --> 00:20:51,092
and the car
corrects a little bit,

462
00:20:51,116 --> 00:20:52,961
and you take it to the limit
and you don't lose control,

463
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:56,937
- you just grab it. Have you ever done it?
- Uh, uh, no, Derek, no.

464
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:01,208
- You want to? I'll take you.
- You should. It's... really great.

465
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:04,261
Let's go right now.
Let's do it. Come on.

466
00:21:04,363 --> 00:21:07,283
- I'd like that.
- Yeah? Right? Good. We're going. Oh.

467
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:09,728
- You need to help me. I need your help.
- Hey.

468
00:21:09,752 --> 00:21:11,813
She's paralyzed, and
it's not gonna go away.

469
00:21:11,837 --> 00:21:14,016
- She's not gonna get better.
- Lexie, hold on. You're all right.

470
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,534
No, not me. It's Kerry Schultz.

471
00:21:15,558 --> 00:21:16,585
She got hit outta nowhere,

472
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:17,753
and it's not gonna
get any better.

473
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:18,970
I need you to listen to me.

474
00:21:18,994 --> 00:21:21,528
Look, this has nothing
to do with that. She's...

475
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:23,997
No, just shut up and
please listen to me.

476
00:21:25,034 --> 00:21:26,901
Make sure she's all right.

477
00:21:27,003 --> 00:21:28,969
I'm trying.

478
00:21:34,077 --> 00:21:36,777
120 miles an hour.

479
00:21:40,099 --> 00:21:41,365
I'm glad you're back,

480
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:43,868
that we're gonna
be in there together.

481
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:46,837
It makes me a little
less freaked out

482
00:21:46,939 --> 00:21:48,539
is what I'm saying.

483
00:21:49,942 --> 00:21:52,209
Is this gonna become a thing...

484
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:55,429
you sharing all your
sad, scared feelings

485
00:21:55,531 --> 00:21:57,097
because we almost
got shot together?

486
00:21:57,199 --> 00:21:59,233
There it is.

487
00:21:59,335 --> 00:22:01,251
Now I know you're back.

488
00:22:06,258 --> 00:22:09,843
This boy got it bad. OK,
throw a stitch in there.

489
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,741
Suction.

490
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:18,352
Hmm.

491
00:22:18,454 --> 00:22:21,972
Staph infection,
which causes cellulitis,

492
00:22:22,074 --> 00:22:24,157
abscess, possibly MRSA,

493
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:26,510
which could lead
to sepsis and death.

494
00:22:26,612 --> 00:22:30,263
- Uh, I'm sorry. Where are you
seeing all of this?
- In Dr. Karev's chest

495
00:22:30,383 --> 00:22:32,799
if he doesn't have
that bullet removed.

496
00:22:32,901 --> 00:22:34,779
I'll cross that bridge
when I come to it.

497
00:22:34,803 --> 00:22:37,120
- Can I leave now?
- No, you can stand right there

498
00:22:37,223 --> 00:22:39,807
to make sure you don't
get into anyone else's O.R.,

499
00:22:39,909 --> 00:22:41,692
not until you're lead-free.

500
00:22:46,916 --> 00:22:48,749
All right.

501
00:22:48,851 --> 00:22:50,751
The heart is ready.

502
00:22:50,853 --> 00:22:53,854
OK. Here we go.

503
00:22:53,956 --> 00:22:55,740
Start the clock.

504
00:22:55,842 --> 00:22:57,207
Dr. Yang...

505
00:22:57,309 --> 00:22:59,576
take the heart, please.

506
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:11,471
Badass.

507
00:23:18,447 --> 00:23:20,747
All right. Here we go.

508
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:25,369
Excising the right atrium.

509
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:29,306
Welcome back, Dr. Yang.

510
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:32,443
Thank you.

511
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:34,344
See?

512
00:23:34,447 --> 00:23:35,757
You went down before
the lightning even struck.

513
00:23:35,781 --> 00:23:38,783
Oh, my God. Warren. I
never even saw him coming.

514
00:23:38,885 --> 00:23:41,668
- Is he OK?
- He's in surgery now.

515
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:44,388
Kerry, your new scan
shows an epidural hematoma.

516
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:46,735
It's blood in your spine that's
compressing your spinal cord.

517
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:48,586
- We didn't see that before?
- Probably too small to see,

518
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:50,644
and it's been
bleeding for hours.

519
00:23:50,746 --> 00:23:53,124
- It's an easy procedure
to relieve the pressure.
- And I'll walk again?

520
00:23:53,148 --> 00:23:56,416
You'll be out on the field
in no time. Book an O.R.

521
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:58,313
- I'll see you in there.
- F... for an actual surgery?

522
00:23:58,337 --> 00:23:59,586
Yes.

523
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:03,023
Thank you.

524
00:24:04,176 --> 00:24:07,361
Oh, so stupid.

525
00:24:07,463 --> 00:24:10,330
All this time... I
never told him.

526
00:24:10,432 --> 00:24:13,717
And I... I had all these
reasons, you know?

527
00:24:13,819 --> 00:24:16,303
And... they seemed
like good reasons

528
00:24:16,405 --> 00:24:17,872
until we all almost died.

529
00:24:17,974 --> 00:24:21,141
I was worried about, what,
about shaking up the team?

530
00:24:21,243 --> 00:24:24,662
It's flag football. We
play once a week.

531
00:24:26,565 --> 00:24:29,065
God, I'm an idiot.

532
00:24:32,838 --> 00:24:35,539
I thought you were in surgery.

533
00:24:35,641 --> 00:24:37,441
Yeah, the guy pulled through.

534
00:24:38,744 --> 00:24:40,010
Is Lexie OK?

535
00:24:40,095 --> 00:24:41,840
Why don't you ask her yourself?

536
00:24:41,864 --> 00:24:44,381
She doesn't need
me talking to her.

537
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:46,461
Well, you're the
one who ended it.

538
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:48,702
Yeah, it ended the
way it always ends.

539
00:24:48,804 --> 00:24:51,221
I get close to the chick,
the chick goes crazy.

540
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:54,107
Rebecca and Izzie, my mom...

541
00:24:54,209 --> 00:24:56,226
I'm a lightning
rod for this crap.

542
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:57,644
You're not that special.

543
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:59,079
Lexie's not crazy.

544
00:24:59,181 --> 00:25:01,225
She had a crazy
thing happen to her,

545
00:25:01,249 --> 00:25:03,478
and her reaction
was pretty normal.

546
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:04,834
And Izzie had brain cancer.

547
00:25:04,936 --> 00:25:06,336
Rebecca... she was crazy,

548
00:25:06,438 --> 00:25:08,550
but that was the facial
reconstruction trauma.

549
00:25:08,574 --> 00:25:10,319
You're not a
lightning rod, Alex.

550
00:25:10,343 --> 00:25:13,610
You're just a guy who's
been through a lot of crap.

551
00:25:13,712 --> 00:25:15,724
I wish I had a
scalpel right now.

552
00:25:15,748 --> 00:25:18,215
Junkie.

553
00:25:20,302 --> 00:25:24,004
- Time, please.
- 2 hours and 42 minutes.

554
00:25:24,106 --> 00:25:26,339
We're behind. Dr. Hunt,
where are you at?

555
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:29,459
- Putting in the aortic graft.
- This tissue is more
than I need.

556
00:25:29,561 --> 00:25:31,562
Dr. Yang, trim this
pericardium, please.

557
00:25:31,664 --> 00:25:33,129
3 centimeters.

558
00:25:33,232 --> 00:25:34,832
OK.

559
00:25:34,933 --> 00:25:37,801
- Avery, give me some
irrigation in here, please.
- Sure.

560
00:25:37,903 --> 00:25:41,621
Sorry. Sorry.

561
00:25:41,723 --> 00:25:42,843
All right. Are we all right?

562
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:44,119
It's all right. It's all right.

563
00:25:44,143 --> 00:25:46,710
It was just a tray. The
aortic cannula is dislodged.

564
00:25:46,812 --> 00:25:48,212
Avery, some suction
in here, please.

565
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,613
Hunt, talk to me.

566
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:50,992
I need a purse
string in the aorta.

567
00:25:51,016 --> 00:25:53,617
Avery, get me some more
visualization in here, please.

568
00:25:53,702 --> 00:25:57,003
- Get in there.
- Yang, come help me. Yang?

569
00:25:57,105 --> 00:25:59,155
Cristina?

570
00:26:01,377 --> 00:26:02,776
Cristina, talk to me.

571
00:26:02,878 --> 00:26:05,212
Oh, damn it. Grab
the aortic cannula.

572
00:26:05,314 --> 00:26:07,214
Hold it there.

573
00:26:07,316 --> 00:26:10,167
Cristina, you are OK.

574
00:26:10,269 --> 00:26:12,002
Can you get up?

575
00:26:12,104 --> 00:26:14,624
Avery, I need that tissue now.

576
00:26:14,706 --> 00:26:16,435
- Is it usable?
- No.

577
00:26:18,027 --> 00:26:19,626
<i>Aah! No! No!</i>

578
00:26:19,728 --> 00:26:21,195
Time, please.

579
00:26:21,297 --> 00:26:22,907
- Time!
- 2 hours, 45.

580
00:26:22,931 --> 00:26:25,098
All right, Avery, call
down to the pharmacy

581
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,511
and get another
piece of tissue, please.

582
00:26:26,535 --> 00:26:30,103
No, don't call. Cristina,
you go. Go now and get one.

583
00:26:30,205 --> 00:26:31,872
Run. Go.

584
00:26:31,974 --> 00:26:35,159
Look, I'll just go. I got it.

585
00:26:39,298 --> 00:26:40,497
The dura is pulsatile.

586
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:41,899
Good catch, Dr. Grey.

587
00:26:42,001 --> 00:26:45,819
Thank you, and, um,
thank you for listening to me

588
00:26:45,921 --> 00:26:47,431
and for not being afraid of me.

589
00:26:47,455 --> 00:26:48,488
Nobody's afraid of you.

590
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:51,058
Mark's keeping me
chained to his service.

591
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,071
He's keeping me
out of surgeries.

592
00:26:53,095 --> 00:26:55,762
He's afraid for
you, so he hovers.

593
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:58,265
Other people might lock
you in a cell overnight

594
00:26:58,367 --> 00:27:00,700
to be urinated on
by a meth head.

595
00:27:00,802 --> 00:27:03,070
But it all comes
from the same place.

596
00:27:06,175 --> 00:27:09,443
Oh, you... you can't be in here.

597
00:27:09,545 --> 00:27:12,546
But we're friends
now, so I'll just shut up.

598
00:27:12,648 --> 00:27:14,948
Good girl.

599
00:27:15,051 --> 00:27:18,685
Dr. Grey, you
shouldn't be in the O.R.

600
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:21,605
Cristina.

601
00:27:21,707 --> 00:27:23,340
Cristina.

602
00:27:26,462 --> 00:27:29,279
I can't be in here.

603
00:27:29,381 --> 00:27:30,425
I can't.

604
00:27:30,449 --> 00:27:33,384
OK, so let's go.
Let's get out of here.

605
00:27:34,536 --> 00:27:37,404
I can't... I can't
feel anything.

606
00:27:37,506 --> 00:27:40,773
I know. I know.

607
00:27:40,875 --> 00:27:41,875
Come with me.

608
00:27:41,944 --> 00:27:45,512
No, no. I... I can't move.

609
00:27:45,614 --> 00:27:48,232
I can't move my legs.

610
00:27:48,334 --> 00:27:51,201
I can't... I can't
feel anything.

611
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:55,706
Um...

612
00:27:55,808 --> 00:27:56,808
Uh...

613
00:27:56,858 --> 00:28:00,076
F... feel my hand. Take my hand.

614
00:28:01,864 --> 00:28:03,997
Do you feel that?

615
00:28:07,536 --> 00:28:09,303
Uh-uh-huh.

616
00:28:09,405 --> 00:28:10,771
Uh-huh.

617
00:28:10,872 --> 00:28:12,438
OK.

618
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:14,691
You're OK.

619
00:28:14,793 --> 00:28:17,393
We're gonna go
when you're ready.

620
00:28:17,495 --> 00:28:20,263
- OK?
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

621
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:22,766
So you tell me when
you're ready, OK?

622
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:24,651
OK. OK.

623
00:28:42,354 --> 00:28:43,670
Is it over?

624
00:28:43,772 --> 00:28:45,088
How is she?

625
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:46,801
Oh, I'm... I'm sorry.

626
00:28:46,825 --> 00:28:48,292
No, no, no.

627
00:28:48,394 --> 00:28:50,138
She's fine. Uh, the
doctors are still working,

628
00:28:50,162 --> 00:28:53,630
and someone will be
out when they're finished.

629
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,700
You're wrong.

630
00:28:56,802 --> 00:28:58,218
Sorry?

631
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,819
There's no time to wait.

632
00:28:59,938 --> 00:29:02,184
People get struck by lightning.

633
00:29:02,208 --> 00:29:03,485
People die.

634
00:29:03,509 --> 00:29:05,820
My best friend got shot, Torres.

635
00:29:05,844 --> 00:29:08,378
Why are you telling
me to give it time

636
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,064
when there's no guarantee
that time is gonna be there?

637
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:14,934
I'm... not gonna wait
around to be happy anymore.

638
00:29:15,036 --> 00:29:18,805
All right. Listen, this is
something that you and I do.

639
00:29:18,907 --> 00:29:20,147
We skip steps.

640
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:22,642
OK, I pushed Arizona
to have a baby,

641
00:29:22,744 --> 00:29:23,984
and I almost lost her

642
00:29:24,013 --> 00:29:26,357
because I skipped
a bunch of steps.

643
00:29:26,381 --> 00:29:29,449
But then I went back,
and now she's moving in...

644
00:29:29,551 --> 00:29:32,085
and ruining my apartment.

645
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:37,324
Look, I'm saying,
proposing might be too much,

646
00:29:37,426 --> 00:29:40,893
- especially if she's
not herself right now.
- I know who she is,

647
00:29:40,995 --> 00:29:43,463
and if she's going
through her worst right now,

648
00:29:43,566 --> 00:29:44,864
I wanna go through it with her.

649
00:29:44,966 --> 00:29:47,417
She makes me happier than...

650
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,587
anything I've ever known.

651
00:29:50,689 --> 00:29:53,624
And if I can have a part in...
in making her happy again,

652
00:29:53,725 --> 00:29:55,592
that's all I want to do.

653
00:29:55,694 --> 00:29:58,578
That's all I want to do
for the rest of my life.

654
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:01,281
All right.

655
00:30:01,383 --> 00:30:03,684
All right. Go.

656
00:30:03,786 --> 00:30:07,570
Go. Tell her that.
But just like that.

657
00:30:13,595 --> 00:30:15,278
Is she dead?

658
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:17,297
She's fine. She'll be fine.

659
00:30:19,301 --> 00:30:22,585
Can you give us a minute?

660
00:30:22,687 --> 00:30:25,956
Whew.

661
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:32,924
You were wrong.

662
00:30:32,948 --> 00:30:35,308
You were wrong about everything.

663
00:30:35,367 --> 00:30:38,351
I know. I'm sorry.

664
00:30:38,453 --> 00:30:41,471
Hey, I heard about
Cristina. Is she all right?

665
00:30:41,573 --> 00:30:43,540
No, she's not all
right. No one's all right.

666
00:30:43,642 --> 00:30:44,953
And that idiot is clearing
everyone for surgery

667
00:30:44,977 --> 00:30:46,788
like they're fine,
and they're not fine.

668
00:30:46,812 --> 00:30:48,072
Stop. Stop. I
need to talk to you.

669
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:49,607
Just leave it alone, Derek.
It was one night in jail.

670
00:30:49,631 --> 00:30:52,416
You drive too fast.
Just forget about it.

671
00:30:52,518 --> 00:30:54,312
I don't want to talk about
that. Don't worry about that.

672
00:30:54,336 --> 00:30:56,496
Don't worry about it? All
I do is worry all the time.

673
00:30:56,538 --> 00:30:58,583
I spend every minute
of every day worrying

674
00:30:58,607 --> 00:30:59,968
that I'm gonna get a phone call

675
00:30:59,992 --> 00:31:02,442
that you've wrapped
your car around a pole.

676
00:31:02,544 --> 00:31:05,529
That's why I left you jail,
so that just for a little while,

677
00:31:05,631 --> 00:31:07,175
I would know that
you weren't dying

678
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:08,943
like you were
dying on that table.

679
00:31:08,967 --> 00:31:10,207
That's what I think about

680
00:31:10,302 --> 00:31:12,786
every time you pull
out of the driveway.

681
00:31:12,888 --> 00:31:16,673
I'm right here. I'm OK.

682
00:31:16,775 --> 00:31:19,843
We're OK.

683
00:31:19,945 --> 00:31:22,529
I was pregnant...

684
00:31:22,631 --> 00:31:24,814
that day.

685
00:31:24,916 --> 00:31:27,600
I was pregnant, and I lost it.

686
00:31:30,472 --> 00:31:32,105
I...

687
00:31:35,076 --> 00:31:37,511
You didn't say anything.

688
00:31:38,947 --> 00:31:41,781
- I coulda helped you.
- If you want to help me,

689
00:31:41,884 --> 00:31:43,628
your driving is
something you can control.

690
00:31:43,652 --> 00:31:46,570
Just do that. Just do that.

691
00:31:48,256 --> 00:31:51,141
OK. OK.

692
00:31:55,281 --> 00:31:59,416
What happened in the O.R.,
we couldn't have seen that.

693
00:32:03,855 --> 00:32:07,540
I... I can't...

694
00:32:07,642 --> 00:32:09,476
I can't do it.

695
00:32:09,577 --> 00:32:11,444
You said I could do it.

696
00:32:11,546 --> 00:32:14,948
I know. I know. I... I
thought you were ready.

697
00:32:15,050 --> 00:32:18,685
You've never not been ready.

698
00:32:22,491 --> 00:32:24,391
Cristina, I know
what you're feeling.

699
00:32:24,493 --> 00:32:26,159
I don't feel anything.

700
00:32:27,929 --> 00:32:30,297
I can't be in there.

701
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:32,131
And if I can't be in there,

702
00:32:32,234 --> 00:32:34,701
I don't know where
I'm supposed to be.

703
00:32:34,803 --> 00:32:36,752
You're supposed to
be here. You're my wife.

704
00:32:36,855 --> 00:32:38,888
You can just be here.

705
00:32:43,595 --> 00:32:46,330
I'm sorry.

706
00:33:05,917 --> 00:33:07,351
You up for a visitor?

707
00:33:07,453 --> 00:33:08,453
Kerry?

708
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,520
Oh, my God. Warren?

709
00:33:10,622 --> 00:33:12,722
Are you OK?

710
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:14,674
Um, they... they told me

711
00:33:14,776 --> 00:33:17,460
that I slammed you really
hard on the field and...

712
00:33:17,563 --> 00:33:21,131
Oh, it's OK. Accidents
happen. It's... it's football.

713
00:33:21,233 --> 00:33:22,382
I'm fine.

714
00:33:22,484 --> 00:33:24,868
Well, they also
told me that I...

715
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:27,120
I got you all
struck by lightning.

716
00:33:27,222 --> 00:33:29,205
- That's...
- I...

717
00:33:29,307 --> 00:33:30,640
That's...

718
00:33:30,742 --> 00:33:33,809
I just... I wanted
to say, I'm sorry.

719
00:33:33,912 --> 00:33:35,879
I'm not.

720
00:33:37,549 --> 00:33:40,233
I love you.

721
00:33:40,335 --> 00:33:44,254
I've been in love
with you forever.

722
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:53,096
Dr. Grey, can you please
push me a little closer?

723
00:33:56,402 --> 00:34:00,436
<i>Lightning doesn't
often strike twice.</i>

724
00:34:02,808 --> 00:34:05,758
<i>It's a once-in-a-lifetime thing.</i>

725
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:07,794
Oh.

726
00:34:09,198 --> 00:34:11,665
<i>Even if it feels like the shock</i>

727
00:34:11,767 --> 00:34:15,268
<i>is coming over and over again.</i>

728
00:34:15,370 --> 00:34:16,870
You paged me?

729
00:34:16,972 --> 00:34:19,405
I did. I have a surgery.

730
00:34:19,508 --> 00:34:22,358
- You're actually gonna let me
near a patient?
- You are the patient.

731
00:34:22,461 --> 00:34:25,211
- Get in there and
get on that table.
- Oh...

732
00:34:26,648 --> 00:34:28,548
I don't need a
reminder of this thing.

733
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:30,550
I'm gonna carry that
day around with me

734
00:34:30,652 --> 00:34:32,585
every day for
the rest of my life

735
00:34:32,687 --> 00:34:33,987
whether I want to or not.

736
00:34:34,089 --> 00:34:36,500
Now they've plastered over
every bullet hole in this building.

737
00:34:36,524 --> 00:34:38,369
I don't need a reminder
every time I look at you.

738
00:34:38,393 --> 00:34:43,563
And I'm tired of bullying
you, so I am asking you,

739
00:34:43,665 --> 00:34:47,734
please, get in there
and get your shirt off.

740
00:34:47,836 --> 00:34:50,954
Yes, ma'am.

741
00:34:52,474 --> 00:34:55,158
<i>Eventually...</i>

742
00:34:55,243 --> 00:34:57,109
<i>the pain will go away,</i>

743
00:34:57,211 --> 00:34:59,712
<i>the shock will wear off...</i>

744
00:35:23,822 --> 00:35:26,238
Oh, hey. You ready to go?

745
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:28,875
I, uh, I pushed our reservation.

746
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:34,013
Do I talk too much?

747
00:35:34,115 --> 00:35:36,983
I'm enjoying you and, and this.

748
00:35:37,085 --> 00:35:39,736
And I feel good
when I'm with you,

749
00:35:39,838 --> 00:35:41,649
but it occurs to me,
well, that's your job,

750
00:35:41,673 --> 00:35:44,507
I mean, to come in here
and to listen to people talk

751
00:35:44,609 --> 00:35:46,303
and to make them
feel good, and I just...

752
00:35:46,327 --> 00:35:49,128
I want to be sure that I'm not
using you for that, you know,

753
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:50,742
and that I'm not
doing all the talking

754
00:35:50,766 --> 00:35:52,098
and the... and the good feeling

755
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:55,334
and that I'm... I'm... I'm not
treating you like a... like a...

756
00:35:55,437 --> 00:35:58,754
Well, like a... like a shrink...

757
00:35:59,507 --> 00:36:02,475
'Cause I'm enjoying this.

758
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:06,813
Now you talk.

759
00:36:06,915 --> 00:36:09,315
Um...

760
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:12,018
Well...

761
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:15,539
listening to you is not work.

762
00:36:15,641 --> 00:36:20,876
I'm happy to talk, but I
have listened a lot today.

763
00:36:20,978 --> 00:36:22,223
I talked a lot, too.

764
00:36:22,247 --> 00:36:24,613
And so for now,
I'd like to say...

765
00:36:24,716 --> 00:36:26,799
I'm enjoying this, too.

766
00:36:34,375 --> 00:36:38,811
And, uh... maybe we can
both not talk for a while?

767
00:36:38,913 --> 00:36:40,479
OK.

768
00:36:40,581 --> 00:36:41,480
Yeah.

769
00:36:41,582 --> 00:36:43,082
Yeah.

770
00:36:43,184 --> 00:36:46,586
<i>And you start
to heal yourself...</i>

771
00:36:46,688 --> 00:36:48,537
Oh.

772
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:51,474
Did you know that
Webber went over my head

773
00:36:51,576 --> 00:36:53,104
and cleared Yang for your O.R.?

774
00:36:53,128 --> 00:36:57,530
We... we really
don't have to... to talk.

775
00:36:57,632 --> 00:36:58,776
- Come here.
- Yeah?

776
00:36:58,800 --> 00:36:59,999
Yeah.

777
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:05,004
Lexie.

778
00:37:05,106 --> 00:37:06,973
Did I forget to clean something?

779
00:37:07,075 --> 00:37:09,008
No. I just need to talk to you.

780
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:11,494
No... you don't, though.

781
00:37:11,596 --> 00:37:13,780
I know that you want to be here,

782
00:37:13,881 --> 00:37:15,765
but you don't have to.

783
00:37:15,867 --> 00:37:17,317
W... wait. I...

784
00:37:17,436 --> 00:37:20,486
I went through a rough
patch, and you helped me,

785
00:37:20,588 --> 00:37:22,188
and I appreciate that.

786
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:25,808
But I am moving out of
it, and you won't let me.

787
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:29,379
You know, you're treating
me like I am a basket case.

788
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,948
And... and... and
everyone is watching you,

789
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:33,850
and they're believing you.

790
00:37:33,952 --> 00:37:35,619
I had a good day today.

791
00:37:35,704 --> 00:37:39,021
I saved a girl
today. I did that.

792
00:37:39,124 --> 00:37:41,724
I am a good doctor,
and I don't deserve

793
00:37:41,826 --> 00:37:44,594
for people to think that I
am anything less than that.

794
00:37:44,696 --> 00:37:49,199
So could you please
just leave me alone?

795
00:37:49,301 --> 00:37:53,369
Can you do that? Can
you just leave me alone?

796
00:37:53,472 --> 00:37:55,588
You got it.

797
00:37:57,475 --> 00:38:02,479
<i>To recover from something
you never saw coming.</i>

798
00:38:09,688 --> 00:38:11,821
Charles was a good guy.

799
00:38:11,923 --> 00:38:13,356
He was funny.

800
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:17,259
Reed... well, she was
kind of messed up,

801
00:38:17,362 --> 00:38:19,895
but she wasn't a bad person.

802
00:38:21,082 --> 00:38:22,125
I just don't...

803
00:38:22,149 --> 00:38:24,066
I don't know why...

804
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:29,171
I shouldn't just get to
walk away, you know?

805
00:38:29,273 --> 00:38:32,341
I don't know why
we made it either.

806
00:38:32,443 --> 00:38:35,645
We just have to find
a way to be grateful.

807
00:38:39,634 --> 00:38:41,751
Son of a bitch.

808
00:38:43,588 --> 00:38:46,423
Agreed.

809
00:38:51,946 --> 00:38:53,346
Paint it beige.

810
00:38:54,716 --> 00:38:56,583
You got a girl...

811
00:38:56,684 --> 00:38:59,452
you love who loves you back.

812
00:38:59,554 --> 00:39:03,256
Paint it whatever
stupid color she wants.

813
00:39:06,944 --> 00:39:09,078
Mm.

814
00:39:10,665 --> 00:39:13,065
<i>But sometimes, the
odds are in your favor.</i>

815
00:39:13,167 --> 00:39:15,902
50 percent of
marriages end in divorce,

816
00:39:16,003 --> 00:39:18,170
so between the two of us,

817
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:21,140
you and McDreamy should be fine.

818
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:27,112
I thought it would fix me.

819
00:39:27,214 --> 00:39:29,259
That's not why he married you.

820
00:39:29,283 --> 00:39:32,184
Well, he didn't marry
me. He married a corpse.

821
00:39:32,286 --> 00:39:34,237
I'm dead inside.

822
00:39:34,339 --> 00:39:37,006
I told Derek.

823
00:39:37,108 --> 00:39:40,176
About the
miscarriage, I told him.

824
00:39:40,278 --> 00:39:43,846
You got married, Cristina,
for better or for worse.

825
00:39:43,949 --> 00:39:45,832
This is the worse part.

826
00:39:45,934 --> 00:39:48,534
The thing is, there
will be better parts.

827
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:50,536
You should go back.

828
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:53,372
Yeah?

829
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:55,592
Yeah.

830
00:39:58,596 --> 00:40:00,797
Cristina...

831
00:40:03,267 --> 00:40:04,734
You don't feel nothing.

832
00:40:04,836 --> 00:40:06,302
All right?

833
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:08,004
You didn't feel nothing today.

834
00:40:08,106 --> 00:40:10,974
You felt scared.
You were terrified.

835
00:40:11,076 --> 00:40:13,109
And you felt anger.
You were angry at me.

836
00:40:13,211 --> 00:40:15,244
And after what
you've been through,

837
00:40:15,346 --> 00:40:16,779
you're allowed, all right?

838
00:40:16,881 --> 00:40:18,593
That's what you should
be feeling. I know.

839
00:40:18,617 --> 00:40:21,150
Because when I was
there, I felt all those things,

840
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:25,421
and I... I took
it all out on you.

841
00:40:27,191 --> 00:40:29,069
And you were patient,
and you were kind,

842
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:32,128
and you stayed through
it all because you love me.

843
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:34,063
You love me.

844
00:40:34,865 --> 00:40:37,700
So, uh...

845
00:40:37,802 --> 00:40:40,570
you can be scared with me,

846
00:40:40,671 --> 00:40:43,005
or you can be pissed
with me or at me.

847
00:40:43,108 --> 00:40:45,608
I don't care, 'cause I'm
gonna stay through it all.

848
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:47,104
I'm not going
anywhere, Cristina.

849
00:40:47,128 --> 00:40:49,161
I'm not going
anywhere without you.

850
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:01,524
Let's go home.

851
00:41:08,399 --> 00:41:10,277
I had already fixed
her before you came,

852
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:14,003
but... that was a nice speech.

853
00:41:15,206 --> 00:41:17,017
<i>If you're in just
the right place</i>

854
00:41:17,041 --> 00:41:19,008
<i>at just the right time...</i>

855
00:41:25,783 --> 00:41:27,583
<i>you can take a hell of a hit...</i>

856
00:41:27,685 --> 00:41:30,452
I lost a baby,

857
00:41:30,555 --> 00:41:32,688
I almost lost my husband,

858
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:35,891
and my best friend
may never recover.

859
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:38,694
So I don't care what you do.
Clear me or don't clear me.

860
00:41:38,796 --> 00:41:40,941
I have no control
over any of it.

861
00:41:40,965 --> 00:41:43,700
I'm giving up.

862
00:41:46,304 --> 00:41:47,704
Well...

863
00:41:55,246 --> 00:41:57,563
that sounds like a good plan.

864
00:41:59,217 --> 00:42:03,402

865
00:42:12,413 --> 00:42:15,931
<i>And still have a
shot at surviving.</i>
