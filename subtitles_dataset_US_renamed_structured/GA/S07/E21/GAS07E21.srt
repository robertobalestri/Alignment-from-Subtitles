1
00:00:05,106 --> 00:00:06,889
<i>We've all heard the saying.</i>

2
00:00:06,991 --> 00:00:10,375
<i>It's one of those things we learn
in seventh grade science class.</i>

3
00:00:10,477 --> 00:00:12,144
<i>Adapt or die.</i>

4
00:00:12,245 --> 00:00:15,497
- I don't understand.
- It's two words:

5
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,367
- "No sex."
- I'm sure there should
be more words.

6
00:00:19,469 --> 00:00:23,872
If you're gonna choose a chief
resident, you have to be impartial.

7
00:00:23,974 --> 00:00:27,342
- Come on, this, now?
- Sex with me,

8
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:30,145
however hot and excellent,
could cloud your judgment.

9
00:00:30,247 --> 00:00:33,281
- This is blackmail,
is what it is.
- No, it is not.

10
00:00:33,383 --> 00:00:37,735
Final interviews are today, and
coincidentally, I am on your service.

11
00:00:37,837 --> 00:00:39,699
- Coincidentally.
- Since Teddy's shutting me out

12
00:00:39,723 --> 00:00:42,274
of cardio, where I can show
my stuff, I'm gonna show it to you.

13
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:46,778
So today you'll see me, not as
your naked and desirable wife,

14
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:51,850
but as a focused, organized,
efficient and deserving candidate.

15
00:00:52,686 --> 00:00:53,730
Who's getting in the shower.

16
00:00:53,754 --> 00:00:54,652
I'll come with you.

17
00:00:54,755 --> 00:00:56,672
No, no, no. No clouding.

18
00:00:56,774 --> 00:00:58,652
Owen, this hurts me
more than it hurts you.

19
00:00:58,676 --> 00:01:01,576
- No, it doesn't.
- I know.

20
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:05,396
<i>Adapting isn't easy, though.</i>

21
00:01:05,498 --> 00:01:10,001
<i>You have to fight your
competition, fend off their attacks.</i>

22
00:01:10,104 --> 00:01:13,238
<i>And sometimes, you have to kill.</i>

23
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,406
Good morning.

24
00:01:18,278 --> 00:01:20,512
You're meeting with
Owen this morning, right?

25
00:01:20,614 --> 00:01:22,263
Yeah.

26
00:01:22,365 --> 00:01:25,801
You're not gonna say anything
about me or the trial, right?

27
00:01:25,902 --> 00:01:29,304
You know, I thought you were
gonna say something like, "Good luck."

28
00:01:29,406 --> 00:01:33,158
But I guess it's every
freaking man for himself, huh?

29
00:01:35,212 --> 00:01:37,946
<i>You do what you
need to do to survive.</i>

30
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:44,152
Tell him that you were instrumental
in getting the chief's trial approved

31
00:01:44,254 --> 00:01:46,722
for phase one human
testing. From mice to humans.

32
00:01:46,824 --> 00:01:48,502
- I'm not doing that.
- Yeah, OK.

33
00:01:48,526 --> 00:01:50,403
I know, you don't like
bragging about yourself.

34
00:01:50,427 --> 00:01:54,295
But you don't even have to brag.
Your diabetes trial does it for you.

35
00:01:54,398 --> 00:01:59,033
It's gonna win every
award. Seriously.

36
00:02:02,672 --> 00:02:05,273
- Just make sure
that he knows that...
- I got it.

37
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,775
- That you've been
instrumental...
- Got it!

38
00:02:10,164 --> 00:02:11,696
He don't got it.

39
00:02:13,751 --> 00:02:15,517
I got it.

40
00:02:15,619 --> 00:02:18,786
I got the job at Baylor,
over 50 applicants.

41
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:21,990
- I... I got it.
- That's awesome.

42
00:02:22,092 --> 00:02:26,561
Well, I don't know. I
mean, it's in Texas.

43
00:02:26,663 --> 00:02:29,231
There are a lot of
factors to consider, right?

44
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:31,950
Yeah, but that's what you
wanted. It's a great program.

45
00:02:32,052 --> 00:02:35,587
Well, I mean, I was thinking of
sticking around here for another year.

46
00:02:35,689 --> 00:02:39,374
Crap. I gotta go. I gotta
prep for my meeting with Hunt.

47
00:02:39,476 --> 00:02:43,076
Besides, if I'm here when you win
chief resident, you'll still have a friend.

48
00:02:43,113 --> 00:02:47,315
Look, we all get it's not
personal. I mean, it's a competition.

49
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:50,969
Sometimes you gotta be a
shark. Congratulations on Baylor.

50
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:58,643
Hm? You see?

51
00:02:58,745 --> 00:03:01,646
- Sorry I'm late. I was cramming.
- What, for Hunt?

52
00:03:01,748 --> 00:03:04,182
- You've got it in the bag.
- No, I'm more worried about

53
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:06,968
the interview with
the social worker.

54
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:10,038
Don't laugh at me, Derek. Nothing
in my life has prepared me for this.

55
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:12,001
My mother was about as
nurturing as a steak knife.

56
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:15,410
I don't know anything about making
lunches or Halloween costumes.

57
00:03:15,512 --> 00:03:17,162
Good moms make
Halloween costumes.

58
00:03:18,499 --> 00:03:21,216
- You can sew.
- I sew skin.

59
00:03:21,318 --> 00:03:24,552
Yeah. Z's gonna be fine.

60
00:03:24,655 --> 00:03:26,755
It's just instinct, right?

61
00:03:26,857 --> 00:03:28,907
You go with her. There
you go. There you go.

62
00:03:28,992 --> 00:03:30,909
Baby...

63
00:03:31,011 --> 00:03:33,812
OK...

64
00:03:33,914 --> 00:03:37,749
She looks good! Her weight's up
and her previous incisions have healed,

65
00:03:37,851 --> 00:03:42,938
the labs are within normal limits and
she's super-duper cute! Aren't you?

66
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,758
So it's an uncomplicated hernia, so you don't
have to use any artificial closures, right?

67
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,204
Yeah, no. No, it
should be simple.

68
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,590
I'll do a short incision
in her suprapubic crease

69
00:03:50,614 --> 00:03:52,347
to do a traditional exposure,

70
00:03:52,449 --> 00:03:54,043
and then I'll...

71
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:57,986
finish with...<i> Chupo</i>!

72
00:03:58,088 --> 00:04:01,422
I'm sorry. That's what
Callie calls a pacifier.

73
00:04:01,525 --> 00:04:04,960
Zola hasn't eaten because of the
surgery. She's probably really hungry.

74
00:04:05,062 --> 00:04:08,046
You might wanna try and
soothe her with a pacifier.

75
00:04:08,148 --> 00:04:10,732
Come here, baby.
Come here, little lady.

76
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:12,800
Oh, yes, there you go.

77
00:04:12,902 --> 00:04:15,286
- <i>Chupo.</i>
- Wow.

78
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:18,440
All right. I'll call you when
we're ready to come take her up.

79
00:04:18,542 --> 00:04:21,459
See? We'll figure it out.

80
00:04:29,636 --> 00:04:34,573
Are you excited? It's been a
month, Abena, you ready to go home?

81
00:04:34,675 --> 00:04:37,542
I snagged some
extra hydroxyurea.

82
00:04:37,644 --> 00:04:41,129
Wait, wait, wait.
You forgot something.

83
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:46,652
You need to take that at home,
OK, along with your antibiotics.

84
00:04:46,754 --> 00:04:49,448
It's gonna help with the sickle cell
symptoms and the attacks will be

85
00:04:49,472 --> 00:04:51,539
- less severe when they happen.
- Thank you.

86
00:04:51,641 --> 00:04:53,385
I'll make sure she takes it.

87
00:04:53,409 --> 00:04:56,528
Now, you have sickle cell, Lebo, so
you need to make sure you take some, too.

88
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,291
- Yes, ma'am.
- Promise me.

89
00:04:58,315 --> 00:05:01,382
Yes, Dr. Alex.

90
00:05:01,484 --> 00:05:04,252
And don't forget, you both have to
have your blood counts monitored

91
00:05:04,354 --> 00:05:06,933
- at the clinic,
even if you feel fine.
- I will. Just as you told me.

92
00:05:06,957 --> 00:05:12,127
I promise. Thank you. Thank you for
helping my sister. Thank you so much.

93
00:05:13,397 --> 00:05:15,497
- Are you in pain, Lebo?
- No, no. I'm fine.

94
00:05:15,599 --> 00:05:17,432
- We have to go.
- Dr. Bailey.

95
00:05:17,534 --> 00:05:18,928
Maybe we should check you out.

96
00:05:18,952 --> 00:05:21,285
She'll miss the plane.
It's no trouble, I'm fine.

97
00:05:21,388 --> 00:05:23,371
OK, wait. Hold...

98
00:05:23,473 --> 00:05:25,707
Gurney!

99
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:27,826
OK, OK.

100
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,512
- How about her?
- She's smiling.

101
00:05:35,536 --> 00:05:38,836
- Who smiles when
they go for a run?
- Happy people.

102
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:41,506
Happiness is overrated.
What about you?

103
00:05:41,608 --> 00:05:44,742
Shouldn't what's his name be
off to save the world pretty soon?

104
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:48,463
What's his name is taking
a break from world-saving.

105
00:05:48,565 --> 00:05:51,566
He was offered a permanent
position at Landstuhl.

106
00:05:51,668 --> 00:05:53,388
- On your left.
- Watch out.

107
00:05:53,487 --> 00:05:55,470
It's a U.S. military
hospital in Germany.

108
00:05:55,572 --> 00:05:58,222
- And he leaves in a week.
- That's great.

109
00:05:59,342 --> 00:06:00,658
He asked me to go with him.

110
00:06:01,995 --> 00:06:04,295
- Wow.
- You OK?

111
00:06:04,397 --> 00:06:06,965
Yeah.

112
00:06:07,067 --> 00:06:08,967
I mean, I really... I like him.

113
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:12,287
I feel like things
could be good with us.

114
00:06:12,389 --> 00:06:15,823
That's just crazy, right? Besides,
I have too many obligations here.

115
00:06:15,925 --> 00:06:18,738
I'm in the middle of my
contract, I have residents to teach,

116
00:06:18,762 --> 00:06:21,913
- I have you.
- You just listed me
as an obligation.

117
00:06:22,015 --> 00:06:26,084
- No. That's not what I meant...
- No, I get it. Like I'm dead weight.

118
00:06:26,186 --> 00:06:30,872
- I'm an anchor
dragging you down.
- No, stop. No!

119
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:33,441
If I move, it might cause
you insurance headaches.

120
00:06:33,543 --> 00:06:35,387
I'm just saying that
we would sort of...

121
00:06:35,411 --> 00:06:39,847
- We would just
have to sort it out.
- OK.

122
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,300
OK.

123
00:06:43,103 --> 00:06:44,903
What about her?

124
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:50,091
Yeah, if a unibrow was
my thing, I'd be all over that.

125
00:06:51,394 --> 00:06:52,694
You're hopeless.

126
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:56,715
What do you got?

127
00:06:56,817 --> 00:07:00,468
Seventeen-year-old pregnant female
with syncopal episode outside the ER.

128
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:02,682
She's got blood in
her left lower quadrant.

129
00:07:02,706 --> 00:07:05,066
Could be a splenic
rupture, but it's hard to tell.

130
00:07:05,108 --> 00:07:06,369
- Abena?
- Abena's fine.

131
00:07:06,393 --> 00:07:07,620
Don't worry about her right now.

132
00:07:07,644 --> 00:07:09,605
You need to worry
about yourself.

133
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:11,307
- You need to have surgery.
- Lebo, why didn't you tell us

134
00:07:11,331 --> 00:07:14,749
- you were pregnant?
- You would have said
I cannot fly.

135
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:19,237
I had to be here for my sister. Is
something wrong with my baby?

136
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:22,607
I see a strong heartbeat, but there's
not much fluid surrounding the baby,

137
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:26,328
- and he's very small
for 32 weeks.
- She's eight months along?

138
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:27,990
Yeah, I'm gonna need
to monitor this baby.

139
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:29,759
We need to take her
to CT first to see where

140
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:30,960
the abdominal
bleeding's coming from.

141
00:07:30,984 --> 00:07:32,278
OK, I'll meet you in surgery.

142
00:07:32,302 --> 00:07:33,696
She's barely breathing.
I'll get an ambu.

143
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,970
I've got blood hanging
and her BP's still dropping.

144
00:07:36,072 --> 00:07:38,890
- No time for a CT.
- Call up and get an OR ready.

145
00:07:38,992 --> 00:07:41,392
It's based on a
protocol used in aviation.

146
00:07:41,494 --> 00:07:44,696
A simple checklist has led to
a huge drop in plane crashes.

147
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:46,843
- Because it cuts down
on human error.
- Exactly.

148
00:07:46,867 --> 00:07:50,001
And I thought, instead of... thanks...
telling you about it in an interview,

149
00:07:50,103 --> 00:07:51,803
I'd walk you through it.

150
00:07:51,905 --> 00:07:55,874
So the checklist is the first
page on every patient clipboard.

151
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:58,693
So you can see, at a glance, that
Mr. Aranda has been checked in

152
00:07:58,795 --> 00:08:02,497
for coughing up blood, has been seen
by a physician, has had a chest X-ray,

153
00:08:02,599 --> 00:08:06,417
and those results have come back.
So now we just need to get a consent

154
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:10,722
- for bronchoscopy
to rule out cancer.
- Cancer?

155
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:13,541
- He might have cancer?
- Like Grandpa had?

156
00:08:13,643 --> 00:08:16,311
- He died.
- What are you talking about?

157
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:18,680
I'm sorry. I said
"rule out" cancer.

158
00:08:18,782 --> 00:08:22,250
There's a spot on your X-ray that
we just need to take a closer look at,

159
00:08:22,352 --> 00:08:26,821
so that we can be sure that your
dad's just fine. Just to be sure. OK?

160
00:08:28,775 --> 00:08:31,009
OK, so that's
"update the patient."

161
00:08:31,111 --> 00:08:34,579
Dr. Hunt, bed seven is admitted for
observation, bed five is discharged,

162
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:38,266
I put in a drain in bed nine and
I'm reporting for further instruction.

163
00:08:38,368 --> 00:08:41,319
- You are organized.
- And focused and efficient.

164
00:08:41,421 --> 00:08:43,972
Well, Mr. Aranda here needs
to go up to bronchoscopy.

165
00:08:44,074 --> 00:08:46,419
- Well, I'll take him.
- Actually, no, proper protocol

166
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:49,444
is to page Dr. Altman, she
will schedule the bronchoscopy.

167
00:08:49,545 --> 00:08:53,632
See? It's right here on
the checklist. Protocol.

168
00:08:53,734 --> 00:08:57,185
OK, so the next step
is the OR checklist.

169
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:06,177
Mr. Aranda, let's get
you up to bronchoscopy.

170
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:09,146
There's a lot of bleeding
here. More suction?

171
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:13,401
- Where's the source?
- Well, so far,
the spleen looks good.

172
00:09:13,503 --> 00:09:15,986
Just keep exploring.

173
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,273
Just a little more retraction.

174
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:21,909
There. Please.

175
00:09:22,011 --> 00:09:25,780
- What's he doing there?
- Nobody move! Gown me. I'm going in.

176
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,860
How did her baby get
tangled up in her intestines?

177
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,773
Right over here.

178
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:36,819
The baby survived a full
term outside of the uterus?

179
00:09:36,843 --> 00:09:38,943
Yeah, it's extremely rare.
Her tubes are scarred,

180
00:09:39,045 --> 00:09:42,174
so the fertilized egg found a place to
implant where it could continue to grow.

181
00:09:42,198 --> 00:09:43,982
Dr. Bailey, grab
his foot while I

182
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:45,861
- free him from these adhesions.
- Why didn't it show up

183
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:47,780
- on the ultrasound?
- Believe it or not

184
00:09:47,804 --> 00:09:50,132
it's missed about 50 percent
of the time. Keep suctioning.

185
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:52,507
OK, he's coming out.
Clamps to Dr. Robbins, please.

186
00:09:52,609 --> 00:09:55,093
Dr. Karev, cut the cord and
take him to get checked out.

187
00:09:57,697 --> 00:10:00,881
OK, the blood in her abdomen
is from her placenta ripping apart.

188
00:10:00,983 --> 00:10:03,735
We need to remove as much
as possible. Be prepared for

189
00:10:03,837 --> 00:10:05,231
torrential hemorrhage.
Check the...

190
00:10:05,255 --> 00:10:06,687
Pressure's dropping.

191
00:10:06,789 --> 00:10:08,673
Damn it! Clamps! Zero Vicryl!

192
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:10,653
We've got to stop this
bleeding or we're gonna lose her.

193
00:10:10,677 --> 00:10:13,361
Cross-match six more units of
RBCs, and get them up here stat!

194
00:10:13,463 --> 00:10:17,198
- Alex, I don't hear that baby!
- Come on, buddy, give it up.

195
00:10:28,144 --> 00:10:30,006
And I've been doing
some research on diabetes,

196
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,440
and I heard you're
starting a clinical trial.

197
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,142
I'd like to see if
I could get on it.

198
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:36,167
The trial has very
specific criteria.

199
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:38,736
The subjects have
to remain impartial.

200
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:41,739
The fact that you're married
to one of my attendings...

201
00:10:41,824 --> 00:10:44,959
Look, I know you've never been wild
about the fact that Teddy married me,

202
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:47,945
but the truth is,
I really like her.

203
00:10:48,048 --> 00:10:51,449
And not just for her insurance.
But she still sees me as a patient.

204
00:10:51,551 --> 00:10:56,604
As an insurance sponge. I
need to get my own insurance.

205
00:10:56,706 --> 00:10:59,085
So in order to do that, I need
a job. And in order to get a job,

206
00:10:59,109 --> 00:11:03,460
it would be helpful if I wasn't going
into diabetic shock every five minutes.

207
00:11:06,349 --> 00:11:09,751
- Hey. What's this?
- Just a med change.

208
00:11:09,853 --> 00:11:13,020
Hunt, my knee replacement got
canceled and I need to break some bones.

209
00:11:13,123 --> 00:11:15,601
- Aren't you supposed to mend
them?
- Well, it's my first day back.

210
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:18,192
And I left my baby for the
first time since we got home.

211
00:11:18,294 --> 00:11:20,962
I need to remember why I
love being a surgeon so much,

212
00:11:21,064 --> 00:11:23,042
or I'm afraid I will walk out
of here and never come back.

213
00:11:23,066 --> 00:11:25,299
It doesn't have to be
big. Just a sprained ankle,

214
00:11:25,401 --> 00:11:26,779
a hairline fracture. Anything.

215
00:11:26,803 --> 00:11:28,736
- OK.
- Oh, my God,

216
00:11:28,838 --> 00:11:31,773
anytime I hear a baby cry,
it makes me think of Sofia.

217
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:37,178
They all sound like her. Wait,
that really sounds like her.

218
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:42,016
- What! What are you doing here?
- It's Bring Your Daughter
to Work Day.

219
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:45,753
- No, it's not.
- I bathed her, changed her,
I fed her,

220
00:11:45,855 --> 00:11:47,254
I napped her, we read a book,

221
00:11:47,357 --> 00:11:51,859
played with that little
hanging jingling thing.

222
00:11:51,962 --> 00:11:55,713
And it was still only 11:30. I
needed some adult contact.

223
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:57,314
Mm-hm.

224
00:11:57,417 --> 00:11:59,078
Please take this
baby away from me.

225
00:11:59,102 --> 00:12:01,418
- Sure.
- I'm serious, take her, Mark.

226
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:05,573
Oh, my God! Oh, my
God! This baby's crack.

227
00:12:05,675 --> 00:12:08,476
- She's a crack baby.
- You shouldn't call her that.

228
00:12:08,578 --> 00:12:11,323
Torres, you're in luck.
Motorcycle crash, 20 minutes out.

229
00:12:11,347 --> 00:12:18,068
Yes. OK. Oh, I love you,
but Mommy's gotta go to work.

230
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:20,010
- Take her, Mark.
- Give me the baby.

231
00:12:20,106 --> 00:12:23,141
- Physically lift her
from my arms.
- OK.

232
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:27,912
- Oh, hi... No!
- No, it's not
that big of a deal.

233
00:12:28,014 --> 00:12:31,149
- OK, I'll be right... OK.
- Back.

234
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:37,422
Lebo's bowel looks clean.
We got all the adhesions.

235
00:12:37,524 --> 00:12:41,575
- How's the baby?
- Good. APGAR scores nine and
ten. How's she doing?

236
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:45,046
We got the bleeding under control and
removed the placenta. We're about to close.

237
00:12:45,148 --> 00:12:47,882
- She's gonna be just fine.
- For now.

238
00:12:47,984 --> 00:12:51,785
She's gonna go back there, she won't
get the follow-up care that she needs.

239
00:12:51,888 --> 00:12:54,433
Once she and her sister run out of
the sickle cell meds we gave them,

240
00:12:54,457 --> 00:12:57,241
- then what are they gonna do?
- The best they can.

241
00:12:57,343 --> 00:12:59,827
What about the kid? He's
probably a sickler, too.

242
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:02,591
- Who's gonna give him
his vaccination?
- How about you, Karev?

243
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,849
- What?
- You.

244
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:06,634
Go there. Go back with them.

245
00:13:06,736 --> 00:13:08,776
The job at Namboze
Clinic has never been filled.

246
00:13:08,872 --> 00:13:10,382
They're looking for
someone who's single,

247
00:13:10,406 --> 00:13:12,518
unattached, with minimum
three years residency.

248
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:15,021
There's a med school loan
forgiveness grant attached to it.

249
00:13:15,045 --> 00:13:17,965
They've been coordinating with you,
they know you. You're kind of perfect.

250
00:13:18,031 --> 00:13:22,300
Well, it's pretty far to
go for a follow-up exam.

251
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:24,764
You'd be great. I could
take care of it with one call.

252
00:13:24,788 --> 00:13:26,137
You just think about it.

253
00:13:31,628 --> 00:13:33,695
Sir.

254
00:13:33,796 --> 00:13:37,248
Avery, that chart over there,
Henry Burton, needs to be screened.

255
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:39,817
If he meets the criteria,
put him in line for phase one.

256
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:44,005
Chief, I... I'm sorry. I need
to step away from the trial.

257
00:13:47,009 --> 00:13:50,394
- You what?
- I appreciate the opportunity. I do.

258
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,563
I don't want to inconvenience
you going forward.

259
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:56,185
I'm not worried about me. You're a
big part of getting this thing where it is.

260
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:58,550
I don't know why
you want to give it up.

261
00:13:58,605 --> 00:14:00,187
That's very nice
of you to say, sir,

262
00:14:00,289 --> 00:14:03,474
but I feel like I need to
focus on surgery right now.

263
00:14:04,744 --> 00:14:08,079
- You're sure about this?
- Respectfully, yes.

264
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:09,697
I am.

265
00:14:11,367 --> 00:14:12,550
Thank you, sir.

266
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:24,412
Excellent work, Dr. Karev.

267
00:14:24,514 --> 00:14:26,697
- Grey, just give me two
seconds.
- OK.

268
00:14:30,085 --> 00:14:32,237
No. I didn't say anything.

269
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:34,149
But maybe you should if
you're so worried about it,

270
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:39,444
- before somebody finds out.
- No one is going to.

271
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:45,099
- Grey? Ready?
- Yeah.

272
00:14:45,201 --> 00:14:47,668
OK, there it is.

273
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:50,938
Doesn't look like a
tumor. It looks like...

274
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,907
Wait... What is that?

275
00:14:54,009 --> 00:14:57,962
I'm gonna come at it from a
different angle. There, that's better.

276
00:14:58,064 --> 00:15:00,097
I just need to
get a little closer.

277
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,818
Oh, my God! Wait, is that...?

278
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,198
- Is that...?
- Is it?

279
00:15:06,222 --> 00:15:08,672
Yes.

280
00:15:09,976 --> 00:15:13,227
- Should we call Dr. Altman?
- No.

281
00:15:14,297 --> 00:15:16,197
No.

282
00:15:23,556 --> 00:15:25,790
Merry Christmas.
You don't have a tumor,

283
00:15:25,892 --> 00:15:28,659
you have a tree
growing in your lung.

284
00:15:29,796 --> 00:15:32,196
- My husband has a what?
- A tree.

285
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:35,850
You could have inhaled a
seedling, and somehow it took root

286
00:15:35,952 --> 00:15:40,187
- and started growing in there.
- We were, um,
trimming our trees

287
00:15:40,289 --> 00:15:42,689
a couple of months ago, and
stuff was flying around, but...

288
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:46,159
Whoa. How can it grow?
There's no light, there's no soil.

289
00:15:46,262 --> 00:15:49,047
It happens. Somehow,
it just adapted.

290
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:53,484
- So my dad doesn't have cancer?
- No. He doesn't.

291
00:15:53,586 --> 00:15:55,886
But he'll need a little
surgery, and then he'll be fine.

292
00:15:55,989 --> 00:15:58,306
Dr. Yang, can I please
see you in the hall?

293
00:15:58,408 --> 00:16:00,924
- My dad doesn't have cancer.
- That's great!

294
00:16:01,027 --> 00:16:04,329
To be clear, I never
said he had cancer.

295
00:16:04,431 --> 00:16:07,197
- You were wrong! You're a bad doctor!
- Shh. Hey...

296
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:10,835
Dr. Yang? One minute, please?

297
00:16:12,439 --> 00:16:14,288
I'll be back.

298
00:16:17,444 --> 00:16:20,077
- You falsified his checklist!
- I streamlined it.

299
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,997
- And I found a tree
in his lung.
- You never paged Dr. Altman.

300
00:16:23,099 --> 00:16:26,950
- You just hijacked this
patient.
- A tree, April. A conifer.

301
00:16:27,053 --> 00:16:28,302
That's...

302
00:16:29,222 --> 00:16:31,438
- Well, that's...
- Mm-hm.

303
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:34,525
Well, did you... Did
you tell Dr. Altman?

304
00:16:34,627 --> 00:16:37,645
No. I found it, he's my patient.
And I'm gonna take it out myself.

305
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:39,596
- You're what?
- It's a biopsy.

306
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:42,733
- A glorified lung biopsy.
- Otherwise known
as a thoracotomy,

307
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,596
which is a procedure
that needs to be

308
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:47,571
- supervised by an attending.
- One little breach in protocol
won't...

309
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:50,069
So you do admit it was
a breach of protocol!

310
00:16:50,093 --> 00:16:55,012
April, if you do this with me, I will
put in a good word for you with Owen.

311
00:16:58,167 --> 00:17:02,303
- Why would you do that?
- 'Cause it's a tree
in a man's lung.

312
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:12,430
I got your CT and
bloodwork, reviewed your files.

313
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:15,616
- Yes, and...?
- And, it looks like, medically,

314
00:17:15,718 --> 00:17:19,821
you're a candidate. But, uh, I
still have some reservations.

315
00:17:19,923 --> 00:17:22,873
- Dr. Webber.
- Andrew Perkins?

316
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:25,676
This is a surprise. Hope
you're not here on business.

317
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:28,796
Actually, I have a lunch
date with Dr. Altman.

318
00:17:28,898 --> 00:17:30,064
Hey.

319
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:32,417
- Hey.
- Hey.

320
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:35,753
Andrew, this is my friend,
who I told you about.

321
00:17:35,855 --> 00:17:40,157
- Oh, the VHL guy with diabetes.
- Among other things, yes. Henry Burton.

322
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:43,261
- Sorry. I didn't mean...
- No, it's fine. I am Teddy's friend.

323
00:17:43,363 --> 00:17:46,430
The VHL guy with diabetes.

324
00:17:46,532 --> 00:17:51,268
But hopefully not for long.
Henry's gonna be on my clinical trial.

325
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:54,255
That's great. You
didn't tell me that.

326
00:17:54,357 --> 00:17:57,174
Well, I don't
like to brag, so...

327
00:17:58,611 --> 00:18:01,412
- So should we get to lunch?
- Yeah, sure.

328
00:18:01,514 --> 00:18:04,248
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

329
00:18:09,104 --> 00:18:11,272
I'm in? What about
your reservations?

330
00:18:11,374 --> 00:18:13,807
You're going against
Andrew Perkins.

331
00:18:13,909 --> 00:18:17,411
Let's just say... I have
a thing for the underdog.

332
00:18:17,514 --> 00:18:22,199
- He is a handsome man.
- He's also one of the world's
foremost trauma counselors.

333
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:25,169
If there was an
earthquake, a plane crash,

334
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:28,055
any kind of catastrophe,
he swoops in and helps.

335
00:18:28,157 --> 00:18:31,470
So you're saying he's a
professional knight in shining armor?

336
00:18:31,494 --> 00:18:34,244
I'm saying you need
all the help you can get.

337
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:38,949
Thanks.

338
00:18:42,405 --> 00:18:44,972
How long of a commitment
would you need?

339
00:18:45,074 --> 00:18:49,026
OK. No, I understand.

340
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:52,463
Yeah, I just wanted a few days.

341
00:18:52,565 --> 00:18:55,566
Yeah. I will. You, too.

342
00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:00,571
- How's she doing?
- Was that...?

343
00:19:00,673 --> 00:19:02,873
Were you just talking
to the Namboze Clinic?

344
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:06,093
Yeah, yeah. I just wanted
to get some more specifics.

345
00:19:06,195 --> 00:19:08,796
- So you're gonna go?
- I don't know.

346
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:11,698
I mean, I'd get to do incredible
surgeries right there in the trenches.

347
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:15,268
Plus, I'd be the boss. After
bringing all these kids over here,

348
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:17,838
I can't imagine going back
to just being a resident.

349
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:20,819
Being chief resident could be cool. I
mean, that would be a reason to stay,

350
00:19:20,843 --> 00:19:26,497
but, I mean, who knows? If I don't
get it, where does that leave me?

351
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:32,019
I'm left here with nothing.
What do you think? Stay or go?

352
00:19:32,121 --> 00:19:36,206
At this point, I really don't
think it matters what I think.

353
00:19:40,546 --> 00:19:41,745
Hey. What are you doing?

354
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:44,048
Getting ready to remove
a tree from a guy's lung.

355
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:45,716
No time for mommy prep.

356
00:19:45,818 --> 00:19:47,996
OK, what if the social worker wants
to ask me about the time I spent

357
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,254
- sleeping around Europe?
- That's easy.

358
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:52,489
You were absorbing
other cultures.

359
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:55,860
OK, and what about the fact that my
mother had early on-set Alzheimer's,

360
00:19:55,962 --> 00:19:57,694
and may have passed
the gene on to me?

361
00:19:57,796 --> 00:20:00,430
Makes you more
appreciative of the gift of life.

362
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:04,034
OK, I put my hand on a bomb in
a body. She could think that was...

363
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:09,589
- Suicidal? No, it was brave.
- I told a shooter to shoot me.

364
00:20:09,692 --> 00:20:11,424
Change the subject.

365
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:20,034
- Chicks suck.
- What's your problem?

366
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:22,736
- Like you'd care.
- I don't.

367
00:20:22,838 --> 00:20:27,041
But I've got four floors to
kill, and I'm on a hot streak.

368
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:30,344
Arizona offered me this
job at her old clinic in Africa.

369
00:20:30,446 --> 00:20:33,798
When I told Lucy I was thinking about
it, she got all pissed and stormed off.

370
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:37,301
Well, did you ask her to come
with you? Tell her you'd miss her?

371
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:40,237
- Look deeply into her eyes?
- No.

372
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:43,857
Well, obviously, she's got
feelings for you. You're dead inside.

373
00:20:43,959 --> 00:20:45,521
You have no feelings.

374
00:20:45,545 --> 00:20:47,494
By the way, you should
take that job in Africa.

375
00:20:47,596 --> 00:20:49,029
It'd be totally amazing.

376
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:53,184
You just want me out of
the running for chief resident.

377
00:20:53,286 --> 00:20:54,996
Just trying to help!

378
00:20:56,422 --> 00:20:58,822
- Can I ask you a question?
- Bring it.

379
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:02,092
OK. What is it about guys with
babies that makes women go crazy?

380
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:05,679
I mean, it's like when you're at the
park and you see a guy with a puppy.

381
00:21:05,798 --> 00:21:07,443
Normally, you wouldn't
even notice the guy.

382
00:21:07,467 --> 00:21:10,751
But then he's laughing and
the puppy's crawling all over him,

383
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:14,788
and then he's tickling the puppy's
little puppy belly, and you're thinking,

384
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:18,943
"I wouldn't mind spending the rest
of my life with that guy." What is that?

385
00:21:22,598 --> 00:21:25,533
Everybody's looking at the
baby, and no one's looking at Mark.

386
00:21:25,635 --> 00:21:27,585
Except you.

387
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:31,939
- Oh, Kepner!
- Cristina.

388
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:33,641
- Did you book the OR?
- I did.

389
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:36,977
Yes! Kepner, you know what? I
think I figured out something about you.

390
00:21:37,079 --> 00:21:38,957
I have not had sex
for, like, three days.

391
00:21:38,981 --> 00:21:40,492
And I think it's giving
me superpowers.

392
00:21:40,516 --> 00:21:42,627
Everything is bright and clear,

393
00:21:42,651 --> 00:21:45,752
I am solving problems. No
wonder you're so organized,

394
00:21:45,854 --> 00:21:48,289
- you have virgin superpowers.
- I don't think...

395
00:21:48,391 --> 00:21:51,491
Seriously, thank you. I've been
shut out of cardio for months.

396
00:21:51,593 --> 00:21:54,395
And today is like the first
day I've felt like myself.

397
00:21:54,496 --> 00:21:56,363
Thank you, I really needed this.

398
00:21:56,465 --> 00:21:58,532
- Oh, my God.
- What?

399
00:21:58,634 --> 00:22:03,203
- You're just, like,
treating me like a friend.
- Yeah. So?

400
00:22:03,306 --> 00:22:07,207
I'll go in and excise the tree with
minimal invasion to your lungs.

401
00:22:08,477 --> 00:22:12,980
- Dr. Yang.
- Join us, please.

402
00:22:16,018 --> 00:22:19,420
Sorry. I needed this, too.

403
00:22:24,526 --> 00:22:27,478
I don't understand, why isn't
Dr. Yang doing the surgery?

404
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:31,615
She's certainly capable, but
Dr. Altman is our chief of cardio.

405
00:22:31,717 --> 00:22:34,435
I have experience with
complex cases like yours.

406
00:22:34,537 --> 00:22:38,723
OK, see, I saw three doctors for
this cough before I came here today.

407
00:22:38,825 --> 00:22:42,042
They all said the same
thing: It'll go away, be patient.

408
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:47,881
Then I wake up this morning
and I'm coughing up blood.

409
00:22:47,984 --> 00:22:50,304
And then this one over
here tells me it's cancer.

410
00:22:50,385 --> 00:22:52,469
Come on, that
is not what I said!

411
00:22:52,572 --> 00:22:56,173
Then, finally, I
meet Dr. Yang here,

412
00:22:56,275 --> 00:23:00,961
and she says it's not a cough and
it's not cancer, but a tree in my lung!

413
00:23:01,063 --> 00:23:04,965
And, just like that,
I'm not gonna die.

414
00:23:05,067 --> 00:23:07,935
I'm gonna be fine.

415
00:23:08,037 --> 00:23:13,924
So if she can do the surgery,
I'd like to stick with her.

416
00:23:17,213 --> 00:23:21,098
All right. Here is a scenario
for you: You're chief resident.

417
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,840
One of your colleagues comes to
you and says that he's dropping out

418
00:23:23,936 --> 00:23:25,803
of a clinical trial.
What do you say?

419
00:23:27,273 --> 00:23:29,756
- Dr. Hunt...
- What do you tell him?

420
00:23:29,859 --> 00:23:33,744
I'd urge him to think
it through carefully.

421
00:23:33,846 --> 00:23:35,958
But I would
respect his decision.

422
00:23:35,982 --> 00:23:38,265
My opinion is that
you have a history

423
00:23:38,367 --> 00:23:43,286
of quitting when things get tough, of
walking away when you are challenged.

424
00:23:43,388 --> 00:23:46,923
Now, maybe it's because you're
not used to working hard for things,

425
00:23:47,025 --> 00:23:50,511
or maybe because you have a
fear of success, but I'm telling you,

426
00:23:50,612 --> 00:23:53,180
you're making a
big mistake here.

427
00:23:53,282 --> 00:23:55,348
I hear you.

428
00:23:56,585 --> 00:24:00,453
I just disagree. Anything else?

429
00:24:00,556 --> 00:24:03,357
- No.
- Thank you.

430
00:24:06,495 --> 00:24:08,262
You're actually
considering this?

431
00:24:08,364 --> 00:24:09,964
Look, just answer the question.

432
00:24:10,032 --> 00:24:14,368
- Can she perform the surgery?
- Yes. She can.

433
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:16,436
- She is capable.
- In my defense,

434
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:19,406
I was simply streamlining the
process, and took the initiative...

435
00:24:19,508 --> 00:24:21,653
Cut the crap! You went
behind my back to spite me.

436
00:24:21,677 --> 00:24:23,655
- Well, you gave me no choice.
- OK, enough!

437
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:25,356
You obviously
have axes to grind,

438
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,225
and I'm not gonna stand
here while you sort it out.

439
00:24:27,249 --> 00:24:29,149
In the meantime, this
patient needs surgery,

440
00:24:29,251 --> 00:24:30,951
he's more comfortable
with Yang doing it.

441
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:32,697
She should be suspended
for insubordination,

442
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:34,349
but you're gonna
reward her instead?

443
00:24:34,373 --> 00:24:37,093
I'll decide disciplinary
actions, Dr. Altman,

444
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:40,210
and I will take them out on Dr. Yang,
not on the patient. You will observe.

445
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:43,030
Yes, sir.

446
00:24:43,131 --> 00:24:45,851
- Kepner, you'll assist.
- Sir, under the
circumstances...

447
00:24:45,935 --> 00:24:48,953
The decision's been made.

448
00:24:49,055 --> 00:24:53,974
I'll make sure Dr. Hunt considers
this in his evaluation for chief resident.

449
00:24:58,681 --> 00:25:01,782
Let's get him prepped.

450
00:25:01,884 --> 00:25:04,702
If it's a sliding hernia,
she could ligate her ovary.

451
00:25:04,804 --> 00:25:06,965
Look, she's freeing the hernia sac
to make sure that doesn't happen.

452
00:25:06,989 --> 00:25:08,784
Is she preparing to
do a Goldstein test?

453
00:25:08,808 --> 00:25:11,041
Is she thinking about
exploring the other side?

454
00:25:11,143 --> 00:25:15,279
Arizona is just being thorough.
Don't worry, everything's gonna be fine.

455
00:25:15,381 --> 00:25:17,425
I wish you would stop saying
that. You don't know that.

456
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:19,583
- Saying what?
- Everything's gonna be fine.

457
00:25:19,685 --> 00:25:23,254
She's got a hernia,
hydrocephalus, spina bifida.

458
00:25:23,356 --> 00:25:26,723
Anything could happen. Her bowel
could rupture, her BP could drop out...

459
00:25:26,825 --> 00:25:28,570
Robbins is not
gonna let that happen.

460
00:25:28,594 --> 00:25:30,471
What if they find
better parents for her?

461
00:25:30,495 --> 00:25:32,335
- Oh, come on.
- What if they realize

462
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:35,599
that we rushed into this without
really knowing what we're doing?

463
00:25:35,684 --> 00:25:38,802
Or that maybe a resident
who works 80 hours a week

464
00:25:38,904 --> 00:25:40,738
isn't the best
candidate for a mom?

465
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,957
So just please stop saying
everything's gonna be OK.

466
00:25:44,059 --> 00:25:46,759
Because you don't know that.

467
00:25:46,862 --> 00:25:48,946
OK.

468
00:25:49,048 --> 00:25:52,466
Everything... is gonna go...

469
00:25:52,567 --> 00:25:55,568
- the way it goes.
- Thank you.

470
00:25:55,671 --> 00:25:57,037
Mm-hm.

471
00:26:05,531 --> 00:26:06,897
Please don't.

472
00:26:06,999 --> 00:26:09,533
This is the only
place she'll fall asleep.

473
00:26:09,635 --> 00:26:13,571
Turns out she's as bored
with radiology as we are.

474
00:26:13,673 --> 00:26:16,506
- I'll get out of your way.
- No, no, no, you stay.

475
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:22,145
Besides, I... haven't
really seen her up close yet.

476
00:26:25,133 --> 00:26:28,468
She's so much bigger
than the last time I saw her.

477
00:26:28,571 --> 00:26:30,737
Eats like a champ.

478
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:33,773
- You wanna hold her?
- Oh, no, no, it's OK.

479
00:26:33,875 --> 00:26:35,809
Come on, look at that
face. You know you want to.

480
00:26:35,911 --> 00:26:41,014
No, it's OK. Yeah, I'll just wake
her and she'll cry and you'll hate me.

481
00:26:41,116 --> 00:26:45,368
Besides, she doesn't look
like she really wants to move.

482
00:27:00,969 --> 00:27:02,319
I should go.

483
00:27:04,106 --> 00:27:05,872
I...

484
00:27:07,243 --> 00:27:11,195
I am really happy for you.

485
00:27:11,297 --> 00:27:14,765
- You seem happy.
- I am.

486
00:27:16,168 --> 00:27:18,735
I have everything
I always wanted.

487
00:27:21,373 --> 00:27:23,307
Almost.

488
00:27:29,148 --> 00:27:31,448
I have it. I have it.

489
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:33,917
Can I get some more
suction down here, please?

490
00:27:38,157 --> 00:27:40,974
- Look at that.
- I can't believe it lived in there.

491
00:27:41,093 --> 00:27:44,244
It managed to thrive in
a hostile environment.

492
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:52,486
- I'm gonna keep it.
- What? No.

493
00:27:52,588 --> 00:27:54,948
No, no, it has to go to
Path and then get destroyed.

494
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:56,527
It's not cancer. It's
a Christmas tree.

495
00:27:56,609 --> 00:27:58,759
It a pathology
specimen. Protocol...

496
00:27:58,861 --> 00:28:00,421
Protocol doesn't account
for trees in people!

497
00:28:00,445 --> 00:28:02,140
Protocol accounts for
whatever comes up!

498
00:28:02,164 --> 00:28:03,997
That's why we have protocol!

499
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:07,367
So there are rules and
steps that we can depend on.

500
00:28:07,469 --> 00:28:11,688
Look, I know the rules seem fussy
and annoying, and people hate them,

501
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:14,992
and the people who enforce
them are fussy and annoying, too.

502
00:28:15,094 --> 00:28:17,978
- But they're there
for a reason...
- Fine!

503
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:21,447
- Take it to Path.
- Thank you. I think you'll...

504
00:28:21,549 --> 00:28:23,033
It's not gonna be you, April.

505
00:28:23,135 --> 00:28:24,629
I don't care how
many boxes you check,

506
00:28:24,653 --> 00:28:26,420
you're not gonna
be chief resident.

507
00:28:26,522 --> 00:28:28,522
Three-O Vicryl.

508
00:28:44,773 --> 00:28:48,074
I... gave Lebo platelets.

509
00:28:48,177 --> 00:28:50,910
And the baby's stable. A
little smushed, but stable.

510
00:28:51,012 --> 00:28:54,781
It's hard to believe he spent the
last eight months sleeping on a colon.

511
00:28:54,883 --> 00:28:57,117
Nice work.

512
00:28:57,219 --> 00:29:01,105
So you gonna do it? Africa?

513
00:29:01,207 --> 00:29:03,273
Honestly, I'm not sure.

514
00:29:03,375 --> 00:29:05,855
It's a big decision
to make in a day.

515
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:10,680
Are you in love
with Lucy Fields?

516
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:14,952
Lucy and I... It's new.

517
00:29:15,054 --> 00:29:16,787
Why?

518
00:29:16,889 --> 00:29:19,422
Because I don't want the person
that I recommend to pull a me

519
00:29:19,524 --> 00:29:21,444
and go running back to
the girl they left behind.

520
00:29:21,543 --> 00:29:26,680
So just... make sure you
know what you're doing.

521
00:29:26,781 --> 00:29:29,349
Or else you'll have
me to answer to.

522
00:29:42,764 --> 00:29:44,431
Admit it.

523
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:48,802
You saw how good this baby looked on
me so you had to go get one of your own.

524
00:29:48,904 --> 00:29:50,837
Everything's a competition.

525
00:29:50,939 --> 00:29:53,940
- How'd her surgery go?
- Robbins said she's fine.

526
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:55,759
- She's feeding again.
- Good.

527
00:29:55,861 --> 00:30:00,230
Because Sofia can't wait to have
a new friend. Isn't that right, Sofia?

528
00:30:00,332 --> 00:30:04,251
You and Zola are gonna be
best friends, isn't that right?

529
00:30:04,353 --> 00:30:08,322
Oh, you just wait. This crap will
be coming out of your mouth, too.

530
00:30:08,424 --> 00:30:10,457
Well, let's hope so.

531
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:13,160
We're dealing with the
international adoption treaties.

532
00:30:14,329 --> 00:30:16,307
And the waiver we
need, they just don't...

533
00:30:16,331 --> 00:30:19,065
usually give those things out.

534
00:30:20,602 --> 00:30:23,035
You're both surgeons.
You'd make good parents.

535
00:30:23,138 --> 00:30:24,404
They're gonna see that.

536
00:30:24,506 --> 00:30:26,401
We'd be naive to get
ahead of ourselves.

537
00:30:26,425 --> 00:30:30,543
You're Derek Shepherd. There's a reason
I've been jealous of you my whole life,

538
00:30:30,646 --> 00:30:33,980
and it's not your hair.
You're gonna be OK.

539
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:39,503
Even Sofia knows that. Right,
Sofia? Say hi to Uncle Derek.

540
00:30:39,605 --> 00:30:42,155
That's Zola's daddy.
Yes, he is. Right?

541
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:44,057
Ohh.

542
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,327
- I'm gonna go feed her.
- Mm.

543
00:30:49,831 --> 00:30:54,234
So I see here that your mother
was a surgeon. What was that like?

544
00:30:54,336 --> 00:30:56,603
Well, being raised by a surgeon,

545
00:30:56,705 --> 00:31:01,174
you definitely get to
be very independent.

546
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:06,930
And... not that I would raise Zola
the way that my mother raised me.

547
00:31:09,435 --> 00:31:13,269
She didn't bake.

548
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:18,909
She wasn't a bake-sale mom,
and I... plan on baking all the time.

549
00:31:20,145 --> 00:31:22,629
How about you
tell me about Zola?

550
00:31:22,731 --> 00:31:28,101
Well, Zola had already had a
shunt and spina bifida surgery,

551
00:31:28,203 --> 00:31:30,937
and then we realized
she had this hernia.

552
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:35,408
And today in her surgery, it
looked like she might go into SVT.

553
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:40,246
And just as the anesthesiologist
was about to push the adenosine,

554
00:31:40,348 --> 00:31:42,348
it's like she knew to stop,

555
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:47,704
and her heart just slowed down
all by itself and she went into sinus.

556
00:31:49,858 --> 00:31:54,027
I... I'm sorry. That's not
what you asked me, right?

557
00:31:54,129 --> 00:31:56,449
You want me talk about
how cute and sweet she is.

558
00:31:56,532 --> 00:31:59,199
And she is very cute and sweet.

559
00:31:59,301 --> 00:32:05,038
And... I'm not doing
very well, am I?

560
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:07,273
I don't have an
agenda here, Dr. Grey.

561
00:32:07,375 --> 00:32:10,744
I'm just trying to get a
sense of who you are.

562
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:14,313
I'm a surgeon.

563
00:32:14,416 --> 00:32:17,350
And I'm a good surgeon.

564
00:32:17,452 --> 00:32:23,189
And I want to be a good mother.
Honestly, I don't know much about it.

565
00:32:23,291 --> 00:32:28,495
But I am ready to learn.
And I'm a fast learner,

566
00:32:28,596 --> 00:32:33,433
and I will do whatever it
takes to be a good mom.

567
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:37,637
You know what good moms do?

568
00:32:37,739 --> 00:32:41,507
They brag about their babies,
and that's what I heard today.

569
00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:46,680
As it turns out, Zola's day didn't
involve playgroup or baby gym class.

570
00:32:46,782 --> 00:32:51,851
It involved surgery. And you
knew where she was every second.

571
00:32:51,954 --> 00:32:54,120
I appreciate you
sharing that with me.

572
00:33:02,363 --> 00:33:03,930
I was showing initiative!

573
00:33:04,032 --> 00:33:07,133
That doesn't mean you get to
pretend that you're an attending!

574
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:08,846
I wasn't pretending, I just
didn't need an attending.

575
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:11,621
- Oh, my God!
- Teddy is doing
a disservice to me,

576
00:33:11,724 --> 00:33:13,484
and to the education
that I deserve.

577
00:33:13,508 --> 00:33:16,209
I had no choice but to take
my learning into my own hands.

578
00:33:16,311 --> 00:33:18,595
So I took the initiative
and treated a patient

579
00:33:18,697 --> 00:33:20,781
and followed through
to a successful outcome.

580
00:33:20,883 --> 00:33:23,761
If that doesn't show the qualities of a
chief resident, I don't know what does.

581
00:33:23,785 --> 00:33:26,345
You're not gonna
be the chief resident.

582
00:33:27,288 --> 00:33:30,456
It's not gonna
be you. I'm sorry.

583
00:33:32,193 --> 00:33:34,127
Is this from the
chief, or from Teddy?

584
00:33:34,229 --> 00:33:36,145
No, it's from me.

585
00:33:38,283 --> 00:33:41,684
You real... You know
how important this is.

586
00:33:41,786 --> 00:33:44,665
Chief resident can make your career.
You have your pick of fellowships...

587
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:46,117
You never had
the qualifications.

588
00:33:46,141 --> 00:33:48,108
- Based on what?!
- Chief resident is more

589
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:53,063
than just a resume boost. It's
managing schedules, overseeing interns,

590
00:33:53,165 --> 00:33:56,032
pushing papers, working
within the system. That isn't you.

591
00:33:56,134 --> 00:33:58,351
- It's never been you.
- I'm protesting this!

592
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:01,221
- You are screwing
with my career.
- And it will kill you!

593
00:34:01,323 --> 00:34:03,106
You're a surgeon.

594
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:06,342
Anything that keeps you from
being a surgeon will hurt you,

595
00:34:06,445 --> 00:34:08,456
and it will make you
crazy. We saw it today.

596
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,930
You're not built for this job.

597
00:34:11,032 --> 00:34:12,960
You will hate it and
you will resent it,

598
00:34:12,984 --> 00:34:18,288
you will fight against it until
you fail. So just be a surgeon.

599
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:20,974
You know, it's what you are.

600
00:34:21,076 --> 00:34:24,327
Just be excellent
at what you are.

601
00:34:26,514 --> 00:34:30,616
- Are you done?
- Yes.

602
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:32,102
Thank you for your time.

603
00:34:39,861 --> 00:34:41,728
I'm not going to Africa.

604
00:34:43,532 --> 00:34:46,098
- Right. Let me just say this...
- No. It's the right thing.

605
00:34:46,201 --> 00:34:51,037
I can finish my residency and then
maybe we can both go to Africa together...

606
00:34:51,139 --> 00:34:54,040
- Alex, I just... Just listen to me.
- You were right this morning.

607
00:34:54,142 --> 00:34:58,694
You said there were other factors
to consider. And you are a factor.

608
00:34:58,796 --> 00:35:01,598
I'm sorry I didn't
say that sooner.

609
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:04,267
When Robbins said they were
looking for someone single...

610
00:35:04,369 --> 00:35:07,420
I mean, that's how I think of myself.
Because whenever I think of a future

611
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:10,790
with someone I always get kicked in
the teeth. So I stopped even looking.

612
00:35:10,892 --> 00:35:16,646
- But now, with you...
- Alex, stop! OK, just stop.

613
00:35:17,465 --> 00:35:19,899
You were right, this morning.

614
00:35:20,001 --> 00:35:22,802
Career comes first.
It's how it should be.

615
00:35:23,805 --> 00:35:26,773
And so I... I took the job.

616
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:30,693
- So call them. Call Baylor...
- At Namboze.

617
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:33,929
I took the job at
Namboze Clinic.

618
00:35:34,032 --> 00:35:39,252
You what? My job?
You took my job?

619
00:35:39,354 --> 00:35:41,674
Like you said,
it's not personal.

620
00:35:42,523 --> 00:35:45,391
Sometimes you
have to be a shark.

621
00:36:00,975 --> 00:36:04,043
My job in Africa? The bitch
stole it out from under me.

622
00:36:04,145 --> 00:36:07,547
- Who?
- Lucy. I told her I'd stay.

623
00:36:07,649 --> 00:36:08,889
You open yourself up to someone

624
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:12,001
- for one freaking second...
- Mm-hmm.

625
00:36:12,103 --> 00:36:14,271
Callaghan, I'll take
a double whiskey.

626
00:36:14,373 --> 00:36:16,573
I freakin' better
get chief resident.

627
00:36:16,675 --> 00:36:18,141
Here you go.

628
00:36:18,243 --> 00:36:20,010
Scotch, please.

629
00:36:22,831 --> 00:36:25,231
Here you go.

630
00:36:25,334 --> 00:36:27,384
You know, the rules
are there for a reason.

631
00:36:27,486 --> 00:36:29,402
- Oh, boy.
- I killed a woman

632
00:36:29,504 --> 00:36:33,340
when I first started
here. I got fired for it.

633
00:36:33,442 --> 00:36:38,294
Because I missed a little
step. One simple step.

634
00:36:39,564 --> 00:36:41,609
We follow the protocols,
we don't skip steps.

635
00:36:41,633 --> 00:36:44,183
People live, simple as that.

636
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:47,988
You know, you're right, I
probably won't be chief resident,

637
00:36:48,090 --> 00:36:53,093
but the checklists work.
You can't tell me they don't.

638
00:37:01,819 --> 00:37:04,521
Dropping out of the chief's trial
was a real bonehead move, Avery.

639
00:37:04,622 --> 00:37:05,983
- Sir...
- Such a bonehead move,

640
00:37:06,007 --> 00:37:07,284
that I started thinking,

641
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:09,375
maybe the chief's
trial is flawed.

642
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:12,879
So I looked into it myself.

643
00:37:12,981 --> 00:37:14,914
The methodology is flawless.

644
00:37:15,017 --> 00:37:18,818
In fact, it's kind of the
stuff that wins awards.

645
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:22,656
Big awards. Like
the Harper Avery.

646
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:27,791
You dropped out of the chief's
trial because you knew that

647
00:37:27,879 --> 00:37:31,781
if your name was on it, it
would ruin the chief's chances.

648
00:37:33,401 --> 00:37:37,937
I respect that you don't want
to succeed on your name,

649
00:37:38,039 --> 00:37:40,189
but don't you ever
let it hold you back.

650
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:49,266
There you are.

651
00:37:49,368 --> 00:37:52,034
- Hey. Everything OK?
- Completely.

652
00:37:52,137 --> 00:37:55,338
I wanted you to be the first to
hear just how OK everything is.

653
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,184
- I got my old job back.
- You're kidding.

654
00:37:57,208 --> 00:38:00,054
Mm-mm. I told them about Webber's
trial, that I'm getting a new pancreas.

655
00:38:00,078 --> 00:38:01,978
I've never used a
pancreas as a selling point

656
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,614
in a job interview
before, but it did the trick.

657
00:38:04,716 --> 00:38:07,262
Which means that I'm gonna have
my own insurance in a couple of months.

658
00:38:07,286 --> 00:38:10,269
- That's really good news.
- I'm glad you think so.

659
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:14,407
Because I've been thinking about us and
our situation and where we go from here,

660
00:38:14,509 --> 00:38:17,827
- and I wanted to ask you...
- Teddy!

661
00:38:17,929 --> 00:38:21,163
Yeah, I will be
right there, Andrew.

662
00:38:23,267 --> 00:38:25,668
Lunch and dinner. The
man's getting serious.

663
00:38:25,754 --> 00:38:30,106
Dinner's to celebrate
what we decided at lunch.

664
00:38:31,576 --> 00:38:33,093
I'm going to Germany with him.

665
00:38:35,029 --> 00:38:36,362
Oh.

666
00:38:38,817 --> 00:38:43,219
Well, that's... That's
really good news, too.

667
00:38:43,322 --> 00:38:45,371
It is.

668
00:38:46,507 --> 00:38:50,143
- Right?
- Yeah.

669
00:38:51,179 --> 00:38:54,146
Because, like I said,
I'm gonna be fine.

670
00:38:56,568 --> 00:39:00,703
Which brings me back to the
question that I wanted to ask you.

671
00:39:00,805 --> 00:39:02,588
What's that?

672
00:39:05,143 --> 00:39:07,293
May I please have a divorce?

673
00:39:09,381 --> 00:39:11,481
Oh.

674
00:39:11,583 --> 00:39:15,367
Yeah, I guess. Sure.

675
00:39:15,469 --> 00:39:17,420
I mean...

676
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:21,791
you don't need
me anymore, right?

677
00:39:21,893 --> 00:39:23,042
Right.

678
00:39:26,214 --> 00:39:29,015
- I gotta go.
- Yeah.

679
00:39:29,117 --> 00:39:31,283
Yeah. OK.

680
00:39:34,122 --> 00:39:37,857
<i>Adapt or die.</i>

681
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:42,561
<i>As many times as we've heard
it, the lesson doesn't get easier.</i>

682
00:39:44,599 --> 00:39:48,835
I fed her, I changed her diaper.
Prettiest poop you ever saw.

683
00:39:48,937 --> 00:39:52,721
- Hi, baby girl.
- Oh! I've missed you.

684
00:39:52,823 --> 00:39:54,974
Yes, Mommy got to be
a surgeon again today.

685
00:39:55,076 --> 00:39:59,846
I got to fix two dislocated shoulders,
and save a leg from amputation.

686
00:39:59,948 --> 00:40:04,450
<i>Problem is... we're human.</i>

687
00:40:04,552 --> 00:40:07,287
<i>We want more
than just to survive.</i>

688
00:40:07,388 --> 00:40:10,223
- Were you staring
at Sloan again?
- Oh!

689
00:40:10,325 --> 00:40:12,885
The... The baby.
Did you see her?

690
00:40:12,944 --> 00:40:16,779
- How did the interview go?
- I'm out.

691
00:40:16,881 --> 00:40:19,465
- What? What happened?
- It's a long story. It's fine.

692
00:40:19,567 --> 00:40:22,168
Seriously, I'm OK with it.

693
00:40:23,255 --> 00:40:26,989
I have you, what else do I need?

694
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:33,896
<i>We want love.</i>

695
00:40:41,506 --> 00:40:43,439
Hey.

696
00:40:45,076 --> 00:40:47,076
Hi.

697
00:40:47,912 --> 00:40:50,279
Hi, Zola.

698
00:40:52,083 --> 00:40:54,650
I'm Meredith.

699
00:40:54,752 --> 00:40:57,487
I'm hoping to be your mama.

700
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:03,993
<i>We want success.</i>

701
00:41:04,095 --> 00:41:06,045
You know it's
gonna be Mer, right?

702
00:41:07,615 --> 00:41:10,966
It doesn't mean that you're a
bad surgeon or a bad doctor.

703
00:41:11,068 --> 00:41:14,137
Some people just
don't fit the bill.

704
00:41:14,239 --> 00:41:19,342
They're better at other things. Like
you and those kids, you're good at that.

705
00:41:19,444 --> 00:41:22,494
But between you and
Mer? She's organized.

706
00:41:22,597 --> 00:41:26,866
People like her, people
trust her, she's a natural.

707
00:41:26,985 --> 00:41:30,403
- People trust her.
- I'm just saying,

708
00:41:30,505 --> 00:41:33,539
go steal your job
back. Go to Africa.

709
00:41:33,641 --> 00:41:36,209
That's what you're good at.
Go do what you're good at.

710
00:41:36,311 --> 00:41:39,612
<i>We want to be the
best that we can be.</i>

711
00:41:39,714 --> 00:41:43,049
OK, I know you're mad, but you
can't just sit here and drink all night.

712
00:41:43,151 --> 00:41:45,317
So I'm gonna take you home...

713
00:41:48,056 --> 00:41:50,389
I... I was not expecting that.

714
00:41:50,491 --> 00:41:52,158
You told me to be excellent.

715
00:41:52,861 --> 00:41:54,627
So I'm gonna be.

716
00:41:54,729 --> 00:41:57,230
I'm gonna be an
excellent surgeon.

717
00:41:57,331 --> 00:42:00,399
And I'm gonna be
excellent in bed tonight.

718
00:42:02,254 --> 00:42:05,521
<i>So we fight like hell
to get those things.</i>

719
00:42:07,592 --> 00:42:09,058
All right, Karev?

720
00:42:10,227 --> 00:42:12,628
Meredith messed with
the Alzheimer's trial.

721
00:42:14,382 --> 00:42:17,233
<i>Anything else feels...</i>

722
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,120
<i>like death.</i>
