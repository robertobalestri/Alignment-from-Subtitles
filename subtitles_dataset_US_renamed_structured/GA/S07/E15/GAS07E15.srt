1
00:00:03,437 --> 00:00:06,421
How much can you actually
accomplish in an hour?

2
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:09,658
Run an errand, maybe?

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,359
Sit in traffic.

4
00:00:11,462 --> 00:00:13,127
Get an oil change.

5
00:00:14,698 --> 00:00:17,766
When you think about
it, an hour isn't very long.

6
00:00:17,885 --> 00:00:20,101
Sixty minutes.

7
00:00:20,203 --> 00:00:22,153
Thirty-six hundred seconds.

8
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:24,422
That's it.

9
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:25,757
In medicine, though,

10
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,892
an hour is often everything.

11
00:00:31,432 --> 00:00:33,465
We call it "the Golden Hour".

12
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:40,472
That magical window of time that
can determine whether a patient lives...

13
00:00:41,975 --> 00:00:43,275
or dies.

14
00:01:01,712 --> 00:01:03,311
Thank you, doctor.

15
00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:07,766
Are you gonna help me at all, or
just sit there and eat potato chips?

16
00:01:09,503 --> 00:01:13,037
I performed four back-to-back
fem-pop bypasses today.

17
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,240
This is the first chair
I've seen since 7am.

18
00:01:15,342 --> 00:01:17,559
And this is the first food
I've had since yesterday.

19
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:20,562
I choose potato chips.

20
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:23,916
You might wanna get that.

21
00:01:28,155 --> 00:01:29,866
Seattle Grace Mercy
West Emergency.

22
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:31,485
You brought this on yourself.

23
00:01:31,509 --> 00:01:33,942
- You volunteered
to help run the ER.
- Got it.

24
00:01:34,044 --> 00:01:37,079
We've got a suspected appy on a
ten-year-old. Let's page Robbins.

25
00:01:37,181 --> 00:01:40,699
You know, I saw a need and I filled it,
like any good chief resident candidate.

26
00:01:40,801 --> 00:01:44,469
Sadomasochistic chief
resident candidate, maybe.

27
00:01:44,571 --> 00:01:47,055
What is up with you?

28
00:01:47,157 --> 00:01:48,590
You're all perky and cheerful.

29
00:01:48,692 --> 00:01:51,092
You know, it's
the fertility drugs.

30
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:53,811
We have stepped it up.
I'm pumped full of hormones.

31
00:01:53,913 --> 00:01:56,459
- You know what's perky?
-

32
00:01:56,483 --> 00:01:59,751
My boobs. They're huge. Am
I supposed to like big boobs?

33
00:01:59,853 --> 00:02:01,904
Oh, God, no. They'll
make you fall over.

34
00:02:02,006 --> 00:02:04,939
So...

35
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:08,360
Callie mentioned a thing.
Or it may not be a thing.

36
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:10,142
At least, I hope it
doesn't become a thing.

37
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:12,910
Hey, I got a patient with a
headache, better after sumatriptan.

38
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,161
He's ready to be discharged.
Just need you to sign off...

39
00:02:15,185 --> 00:02:17,435
Is he neurologically
intact? You did a CT?

40
00:02:17,537 --> 00:02:20,255
I did, it was negative. Most
interesting thing about this guy

41
00:02:20,357 --> 00:02:22,502
is that he came into the
ER for a glorified migraine,

42
00:02:22,526 --> 00:02:24,793
- with a girlfriend from hell.
- Which one is she?

43
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:26,494
Just point with your eyes.

44
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:32,851
Mmm-hm.

45
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:36,238
- Here.
- Thank you.

46
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:39,974
- So Callie had a thing...
- Yeah.

47
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:42,244
- What kind of thing?
- Grey, you paged?

48
00:02:42,346 --> 00:02:44,858
Yeah, we have a suspected appy
on a ten-year-old, two minutes out.

49
00:02:44,882 --> 00:02:47,049
- An unexpected thing.
- Grey, call up.

50
00:02:47,151 --> 00:02:48,711
- Tell them to get an OR ready.
- I already did.

51
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:51,130
OR five is prepped
and ready for you.

52
00:02:51,154 --> 00:02:53,572
Callie asked me to be
her baby's godmother.

53
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:56,391
Oh.

54
00:02:56,493 --> 00:03:00,379
Well, you said no to that,
right? You gotta say no to that.

55
00:03:02,082 --> 00:03:03,715
Um...

56
00:03:05,986 --> 00:03:07,530
- EKG results.
- Thank you.

57
00:03:07,554 --> 00:03:10,872
The guys at work overreacted
and insisted I come to the ER.

58
00:03:10,974 --> 00:03:14,509
Sweetie, I had a big lunch. It
hardly qualifies as chest pain.

59
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:18,580
No, what I need are some
antacids. I'll be there, I promise.

60
00:03:18,682 --> 00:03:22,801
Just tell Max to put on his
jersey. I'll be out of here soon.

61
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:26,955
Hi, I'm Dr. Grey. I'll
be your doctor today.

62
00:03:27,057 --> 00:03:29,190
Oliver Richter. Sorry
about the phone.

63
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:31,771
I'm supposed to be picking up my
son for the Huskies game right now.

64
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:34,997
- I'm sure he'll understand.
- - You don't know my son.

65
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:37,293
Very few things more
important to him than basketball.

66
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:41,186
Big fan, huh? I'm just
gonna take a quick listen.

67
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:47,075
Biggest nine-year-old
fan you ever seen.

68
00:03:50,881 --> 00:03:54,916
OK. So it says here that you've
been experiencing some chest pain.

69
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:58,336
- When did that start?
- An hour ago,
maybe two.

70
00:03:58,438 --> 00:03:59,838
But I'm already
feeling much better.

71
00:03:59,873 --> 00:04:02,085
You wouldn't just be saying
that to get discharged faster?

72
00:04:02,109 --> 00:04:05,610
I got my son tickets to
this game for his birthday.

73
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:07,924
He's been marking off the
days on his calendar for weeks.

74
00:04:07,948 --> 00:04:09,748
I can't be the
reason he misses it.

75
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:12,366
OK, well, your EKG looks normal,

76
00:04:12,468 --> 00:04:14,580
and your heart sounds
good. But if there's one thing

77
00:04:14,604 --> 00:04:17,322
we don't take lightly around
here, it's chest pain, so...

78
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:19,368
Could we go back and just
pretend I said heartburn?

79
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:23,444
- Would that get me
out any faster?
- No, probably not.

80
00:04:23,546 --> 00:04:27,132
But Tyler is going to do
a portable chest X-ray,

81
00:04:27,234 --> 00:04:29,262
and we're gonna do
a chest pain work-up.

82
00:04:29,286 --> 00:04:31,870
And we will try to make it
as quick as possible, OK?

83
00:04:31,972 --> 00:04:36,058
Thanks, Dr. Grey,
so much. Thanks.

84
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:44,849
So, this is gonna be a thing.
Why am I telling Callie no again?

85
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:48,837
While you're here, I need a
second opinion on this EKG.

86
00:04:48,939 --> 00:04:53,041
- Do you see anything?
- No. Looks normal.

87
00:04:53,143 --> 00:04:54,504
What are you doing here? I
thought you had the night off.

88
00:04:54,528 --> 00:04:56,128
Yeah, I do. I'm not here.

89
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:57,507
What's Medical
Records' extension?

90
00:04:57,531 --> 00:04:58,892
Looks like you're here
to me, which is good,

91
00:04:58,916 --> 00:05:00,432
because we're
swamped. Take your pick:

92
00:05:00,534 --> 00:05:02,350
impacted bowel, suspicious rash

93
00:05:02,452 --> 00:05:04,669
- or a really smelly guy.
- Forget it. I only came in

94
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:07,734
because Medical Records called and
said I had to sign all my unsigned charts

95
00:05:07,758 --> 00:05:09,991
or they would
suspend my privileges.

96
00:05:10,093 --> 00:05:12,755
You're getting suspended? Dibs
on his solo splenectomy tomorrow.

97
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:14,924
I better be able to finish this
crap before the game tonight.

98
00:05:14,948 --> 00:05:16,709
I told a patient yesterday
he didn't have cancer,

99
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:18,733
and he was so happy, he
gave me two floor seats.

100
00:05:18,835 --> 00:05:20,075
You took a gift from a patient?

101
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:22,434
Did you tell him you
cured his cancer?

102
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,825
Oh. Colectomy time. I'm out.

103
00:05:26,926 --> 00:05:30,011
Excuse me. Hi, I'm sorry.

104
00:05:30,113 --> 00:05:33,799
We were told that somebody would be
by to set our son's leg. Nathan Englundar?

105
00:05:33,901 --> 00:05:36,368
It was a while ago,
several hours, actually...

106
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:38,615
No, I know, you've been here a
while. I'm sorry. The problem is

107
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,789
we just don't have enough ORs
available for non-emergent cases.

108
00:05:41,891 --> 00:05:43,324
An OR? Why would you need an OR?

109
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:45,171
Your pediatrician hasn't
been by to speak to you yet?

110
00:05:45,195 --> 00:05:48,546
Your son has a broken
femur, which is a severe break.

111
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:51,116
It requires a full cast
on the broken leg

112
00:05:51,218 --> 00:05:55,287
connected to a cast on the other leg to keep
everything still so the bones will heal properly.

113
00:05:55,389 --> 00:05:56,988
Two full leg casts
on a four-year-old?

114
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:59,552
And because your son is so young,
we can't set the bones properly

115
00:05:59,576 --> 00:06:01,821
- without putting him under.
- Under, meaning anesthesia?

116
00:06:01,845 --> 00:06:06,798
And that requires an OR. I'm sorry. I
know you've been waiting a long time.

117
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,861
As soon as an OR
opens up, I'll let you know.

118
00:06:08,885 --> 00:06:11,302
- Thank you. Thank you.
- OK.

119
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:13,404
The losers in Medical
Records aren't answering.

120
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:15,985
Are you sure you can't stay and
help out with some of this stuff?

121
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:18,210
Floor seats!

122
00:06:18,312 --> 00:06:21,513
I understand what
you are suggesting.

123
00:06:21,615 --> 00:06:27,552
I know it is done by many medical
professionals in this hospital.

124
00:06:27,654 --> 00:06:31,822
But I am not a medical professional
who would ever consider...

125
00:06:31,925 --> 00:06:33,925
Maybe you should consider it.

126
00:06:34,027 --> 00:06:38,029
Eli Lloyd! Do not test me.

127
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:40,026
Maybe you should consider
the potential benefits.

128
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:44,186
All the intensely exciting,
toe-curling potential...

129
00:06:44,288 --> 00:06:46,554
benefits.

130
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:49,457
Dr. Bailey.

131
00:06:55,732 --> 00:06:59,134
OK. This is gonna be for a
prescription-strength migraine medicine.

132
00:06:59,236 --> 00:07:00,635
Just don't take it with alcohol.

133
00:07:00,737 --> 00:07:04,022
We're missing our anniversary
dinner because you have a headache.

134
00:07:04,124 --> 00:07:06,736
A headache. Do you know how hard
it is to get reservations at this place?

135
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,044
I'm sorry, Gia. I am.
But it really hurts.

136
00:07:12,065 --> 00:07:15,416
Hi, I'm Dr. Grey. I'll
be... Mrs. Webber?

137
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:17,747
- Hi, dear. How are you?
- I'm fine. How are you?

138
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:20,654
- Does the chief
know you're here?
- Please don't bother him.

139
00:07:20,757 --> 00:07:22,724
I had a little fall, is all.

140
00:07:22,826 --> 00:07:25,459
Got home from work,
slipped off the step ladder...

141
00:07:25,561 --> 00:07:27,028
Ooh.

142
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:29,897
Landed on my wrist.
It's basically nothing.

143
00:07:29,999 --> 00:07:33,835
- Well, it's not nothing.
- I brought lots of magazines

144
00:07:33,937 --> 00:07:37,989
and a good novel, I am perfectly
fine waiting until you make time for me.

145
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:40,475
I know you have far
more pressing patients.

146
00:07:40,577 --> 00:07:44,729
Well, you're the chief's wife. So that
makes you my most pressing patient.

147
00:07:44,814 --> 00:07:48,165
- They opened the doors for us.
- Are you sure about that?

148
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:50,814
We'll be in and out. But I can't
believe you wouldn't let me drive.

149
00:07:50,838 --> 00:07:55,307
You're drunker than I am. I can't
believe you tried to stiff the cabbie.

150
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:57,275
Wow, it is bright in here.

151
00:07:57,377 --> 00:08:01,229
Hey, could somebody
do something about this?

152
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:17,362
You're a little early. I
thought our date was at 6:30.

153
00:08:17,464 --> 00:08:20,248
I'm here now because a guy
just walked into the pit with a knife

154
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:22,767
- sticking out of his head.
- Sweet.

155
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:26,020
- I mean, poor guy.
- Is he stable?

156
00:08:26,123 --> 00:08:28,156
- He's neurologically intact,
but...
- All right.

157
00:08:28,258 --> 00:08:31,892
Well, I need to check on him sooner
than later. So, Avery, take him down to CT.

158
00:08:31,995 --> 00:08:34,156
- Stay with him
until I get there.
- Will do.

159
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:37,014
OK. So you'll be down to see
knife guy when you're done?

160
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:38,866
- I will.
- And then we'll have our date?

161
00:08:38,969 --> 00:08:41,902
- Wouldn't miss it.
- 6:30. Don't forget.

162
00:08:42,873 --> 00:08:44,422
How'd this guy get
a knife in his head?

163
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:47,425
Apparently, there was a
brawl at a tailgate party.

164
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:50,745
So you know how stupid
guys get... Dr. Bailey!

165
00:08:50,847 --> 00:08:51,980
I'm taking a nap!

166
00:08:52,082 --> 00:08:53,915
I'm sorry.

167
00:08:54,017 --> 00:08:57,685
What I mean to say is,
I'm going to use this room

168
00:08:57,787 --> 00:09:01,205
to take a nap. Because that's
what people do in these rooms.

169
00:09:01,307 --> 00:09:04,943
When they are tired.
'Cause I have a child

170
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:09,781
and a full-time job and work
long hours, so I am just tired.

171
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:13,117
Just very, very tired.

172
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:18,472
- OK.
- OK.

173
00:09:18,574 --> 00:09:21,158
I was just gonna ask you,
had you seen Dr. Altman?

174
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:23,828
No! I have not seen Dr. Altman.

175
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:26,464
Nor any other doctors or nurses.

176
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,066
Because I will be in this room.

177
00:09:28,168 --> 00:09:31,186
Asleep. By myself.

178
00:09:32,272 --> 00:09:36,741
Actually, I see her
now. Dr. Altman!

179
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:40,511
I'm... I'm...

180
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:43,759
Dr. Altman, do you have
time for a quick consult?

181
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:46,984
I was supposed to be
off by six, but... OK. Sure.

182
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:48,919
- Just walk with me.
- OK, so...

183
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:51,672
Damn it, he's early. Um...

184
00:09:51,774 --> 00:09:53,991
Just, Grey, gimme a second.

185
00:09:59,232 --> 00:10:01,733
- Hi. William.
- Hey.

186
00:10:01,835 --> 00:10:05,303
- It's, it's nice to see you.
- Wow. You look amazing.

187
00:10:05,405 --> 00:10:07,405
- Oh.
- And so official.

188
00:10:07,507 --> 00:10:09,857
I mean, I knew you
were a doctor, but you...

189
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:13,394
- are a doctor.
- Sorry, I didn't have time to
change.

190
00:10:13,496 --> 00:10:16,931
- I'm just...
- No, the scrubs
are strangely sexy.

191
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:19,083
Thanks. You know, I have
a few things to wrap up.

192
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:22,520
Do you mind hanging out for
a few minutes? Like ten, tops.

193
00:10:22,605 --> 00:10:25,873
Yeah, no problem. Take your
time. I'll just grab a seat here.

194
00:10:25,975 --> 00:10:28,460
Hey, stranger.

195
00:10:28,562 --> 00:10:33,748
Henry! I didn't... I didn't
know that you were here today.

196
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:35,995
Yeah. They wanted to run
a blood glucose test on me.

197
00:10:36,019 --> 00:10:37,980
So they gave me this nasty,
orange Kool-Aid to drink.

198
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:40,433
In about an hour, I gotta go
give 'em some blood. Or pee.

199
00:10:40,457 --> 00:10:44,092
And we really don't need
to talk about my bodily fluids.

200
00:10:44,194 --> 00:10:46,393
- Sorry to be rude. Hi.
- Hey.

201
00:10:46,495 --> 00:10:51,716
Oh, sorry. Yeah... William,
Henry. Henry, William.

202
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:56,287
- Are you a patient of Teddy's?
- Something like that.

203
00:10:58,808 --> 00:11:01,509
Anyway, I gotta
go, but I'll be back.

204
00:11:01,611 --> 00:11:04,178
Soon. Promise.

205
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:08,244
- All right, Grey,
what do you got?
- OK, 42-year-old male,

206
00:11:08,268 --> 00:11:12,403
complaining of midsternal chest
pain. No cardiac risk factors, no angina,

207
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:15,256
pain doesn't radiate.
The EKG looks clean.

208
00:11:15,358 --> 00:11:18,276
These are his films.
They're mostly clear, but...

209
00:11:18,378 --> 00:11:20,912
I don't know. Does the
mediastinum look a little wide to you?

210
00:11:20,997 --> 00:11:22,591
Because I know sometimes that
can happen with a portable X-ray.

211
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:24,315
- You got cardiac enzymes?
- Yes.

212
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:26,668
- Hey, Kepner!
- Yeah?

213
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,447
How good are you
at forging signatures?

214
00:11:28,471 --> 00:11:31,956
Even if I were good at forging
signatures, I wouldn't do it.

215
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:34,125
It's unethical and probably
illegal, so I'm sorry,

216
00:11:34,227 --> 00:11:36,739
you're just gonna have to finish
signing your charts on your own.

217
00:11:36,763 --> 00:11:39,030
I'll check on Mr. Richter
right now. Call Radiology.

218
00:11:39,132 --> 00:11:41,294
Get him in for a PA and lateral
films, and tell them to rush it,

219
00:11:41,318 --> 00:11:43,562
'cause I would really like to get
out of here and go on my date.

220
00:11:43,586 --> 00:11:45,269
I mean, did you see that guy?

221
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:47,322
No forging signatures, Karev!

222
00:11:47,424 --> 00:11:50,425
- Radiology, please.
- Forgery? Why am I not
surprised?

223
00:11:50,527 --> 00:11:53,172
Whatever. I just wanna get out of
here so I can get to this game tonight.

224
00:11:53,196 --> 00:11:55,613
Wait, you have tickets?

225
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,510
Tonight? It's the
PAC-10 title game.

226
00:11:57,534 --> 00:12:00,234
- Yeah, I know.
- Win this and the Huskies get

227
00:12:00,337 --> 00:12:01,864
an automatic bid
to March Madness.

228
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:04,055
Why do you think
I'm powering through

229
00:12:04,157 --> 00:12:07,324
all these stupid charts.
Hey, what are you doing?

230
00:12:07,427 --> 00:12:10,547
Of my ten patients in labor right now,
none of them are past three centimeters,

231
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:13,531
which means I have some time to
kill, and you can't miss this game.

232
00:12:13,633 --> 00:12:16,801
- Hand me a pen.
- I thought you
thought I was a loser.

233
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:20,438
You're a little less loser-y now
I know you like college hoops.

234
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:30,325
Hey. Where's the knife guy? Is
it true he's walking and talking?

235
00:12:30,349 --> 00:12:32,750
- What about your colectomy?
- Ah, postponed.

236
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:36,092
The wife snuck him a cheeseburger
and fries before surgery.

237
00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:38,489
So this thing with Callie.

238
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,553
I mean, you know
it's a bad idea, right?

239
00:12:40,577 --> 00:12:42,910
You don't want to be
Callie's baby's godmother.

240
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:45,446
- I don't?
- No!

241
00:12:45,548 --> 00:12:48,961
Think of how many people have to
die before you even get to step up.

242
00:12:48,985 --> 00:12:52,486
Mark, Callie and Arizona.

243
00:12:52,588 --> 00:12:56,340
- That's a lot of people.
- It is. Yes.

244
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:58,509
- A lot of dead people.
- Right!

245
00:12:58,612 --> 00:13:00,878
Whereas, if you were my
baby's godmother-in-waiting,

246
00:13:00,981 --> 00:13:04,541
it's only me and Derek. One
wrong turn down a dark, twisty road,

247
00:13:04,634 --> 00:13:07,701
boom, you're in.

248
00:13:07,803 --> 00:13:11,555
OK, let's be clear. If I am ever
a godparent to anyone's kid,

249
00:13:11,658 --> 00:13:15,760
it will be in name only. I will
not be taking care of children.

250
00:13:15,862 --> 00:13:18,429
That's what boarding schools are
for. Which way to Butcher Block?

251
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:21,866
- Trauma two.
- - Feels like a roller, dude.

252
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:24,785
- I've never seen...
- I understand you might be thirsty,

253
00:13:24,888 --> 00:13:27,088
but I'm sorry, you
cannot drink beer in here.

254
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:30,007
- You're wasting it!
- Cool.

255
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:33,027
Oliver, did you see Dr. Altman?

256
00:13:33,129 --> 00:13:35,846
She's sending me
off for another X-ray.

257
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:37,693
I know you guys have
to cover all your bases...

258
00:13:37,717 --> 00:13:39,784
I know, I'm sorry. But I
put a rush on the X-ray,

259
00:13:39,886 --> 00:13:42,937
- so hopefully it'll be quick. OK?
- Grey!

260
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,572
Excuse me.

261
00:13:44,674 --> 00:13:47,825
I was finishing a
surgery just now,

262
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:51,545
when a scrub nurse asked
me how my wife was feeling.

263
00:13:51,647 --> 00:13:54,382
Because she'd heard Adele
was in the ER, and I hadn't.

264
00:13:54,484 --> 00:13:57,768
Would you like to explain to me
why I found out my wife was a patient

265
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:00,454
in this hospital from my
scrub nurse and not from you?

266
00:14:00,556 --> 00:14:03,240
Richard, hush. Let
Meredith do her job.

267
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:07,078
She hasn't even had a
chance to examine me yet.

268
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,314
- Is that true?
- Don't mind him, dear.

269
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:12,666
He's just worried about me.
He gets gruff when he's worried.

270
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:14,819
I hurt my wrist.

271
00:14:14,921 --> 00:14:16,815
I was trying to get out
the holiday decorations

272
00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:20,992
and I, ooh, I slipped off
the step ladder. Stupid.

273
00:14:21,093 --> 00:14:25,113
I should have waited for Richard to
get home. He's so much taller than me.

274
00:14:25,215 --> 00:14:27,698
I requested an X-ray
and an ortho consult.

275
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:31,152
I will call and make sure that
they're coming down, but I...

276
00:14:31,254 --> 00:14:33,015
Don't touch that!

277
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:37,541
- I think I better
go see what that is.
- You better.

278
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:39,126
Is everything all right?

279
00:14:39,228 --> 00:14:41,028
- Yes.
- No.

280
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:44,582
I was just showing these guys
how, when I scrunch up my eyebrows,

281
00:14:44,684 --> 00:14:46,395
- the knife moves, see?
- Oh, my God!

282
00:14:46,419 --> 00:14:48,102
- Don't do that!
- Stop!

283
00:14:48,204 --> 00:14:50,204
- Stop moving the knife!
- OK, OK!

284
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:54,158
You guys shoulda seen the brawl.
Stew-ball kicked that other guy's ass!

285
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:57,312
And now Stew-ball
has a knife in his head.

286
00:14:57,414 --> 00:15:00,781
OK, let's focus. Stewart,
how much is 14 plus four?

287
00:15:00,883 --> 00:15:03,351
- Eighteen.
- Twenty-seven minus 13?

288
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,388
- Fifteen?
- No. One seventy-two minus 60?

289
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:10,741
I have no idea, but it's
not because of the knife.

290
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:13,010
- It's just 'cause I'm so drunk.
- No, actually,

291
00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:16,029
- it's just 'cause he's dumb.
- Thanks, David. Really?!

292
00:15:16,131 --> 00:15:19,650
Unbelievable. His mental
status is completely intact,

293
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,330
if you don't account
for his math skills.

294
00:15:21,354 --> 00:15:23,048
It's like the knife
did no damage at all.

295
00:15:23,072 --> 00:15:24,883
So why don't you
just pull the thing out?

296
00:15:24,907 --> 00:15:28,209
- We've got a games to gets to!
- I'll drink to that!

297
00:15:28,328 --> 00:15:32,162
- No! No beer!
- Buzz kill.

298
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:34,749
- Uh-oh! Hey!
- No!

299
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:36,634
How many do you have?

300
00:15:38,571 --> 00:15:42,106
OK. Oliver's in X-ray, Stewart
is stable and waiting for Derek,

301
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:44,692
who should be here soon.
Adele is waiting on Ortho.

302
00:15:44,794 --> 00:15:48,161
And can I get the discharges
from the last hour, please?

303
00:15:48,264 --> 00:15:52,850
Oh, and the boy in bed seven with
the broken leg, Nathan Englundar.

304
00:15:52,953 --> 00:15:55,987
Let's check on the status
of the OR for him, please.

305
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,869
Is this Lexie's patient
with the headache?

306
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:03,094
- Yeah.
- Mitch Turner?

307
00:16:03,196 --> 00:16:05,796
- How long ago was he
discharged?
- Not long, a few minutes ago.

308
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:08,049
Did he leave? Did
he already leave?

309
00:16:13,423 --> 00:16:18,025
Mr. Turner! Mr. Turner, I need
you to try to smile for me, please?

310
00:16:18,127 --> 00:16:22,430
- Who the hell are you?
- I need you to try
to smile for me.

311
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:25,344
Can you lift your arms
above your head like this?

312
00:16:25,368 --> 00:16:27,969
Dr. Grey, is
everything all right?

313
00:16:28,071 --> 00:16:29,903
No, it's not. We got a code CVA.

314
00:16:30,005 --> 00:16:32,017
Let's get a stretcher out here
stat! Can you repeat after me?

315
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:33,941
"The dog chased after the cat."

316
00:16:34,043 --> 00:16:38,112
The... The dog
chase... chased after...

317
00:16:38,214 --> 00:16:40,276
What's going on?
What's happening to him?

318
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,360
- I need you to help me.
- What's happening to him?!

319
00:16:41,384 --> 00:16:42,711
We need to get
him on the ground.

320
00:16:42,735 --> 00:16:44,351
The dog ch...

321
00:16:44,454 --> 00:16:47,789
OK. Get your purse under
his head quickly, please,

322
00:16:47,891 --> 00:16:50,774
and help me secure
his arm. Hold it like this.

323
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:54,078
- OK, but why are we doing this?
- Because he's having a stroke.

324
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:03,421
Unsteady gait, slurred
speech, asymmetric smile.

325
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:05,534
Symptoms started no
more than 20 minutes ago.

326
00:17:05,558 --> 00:17:07,691
So we should be well
within the golden hour.

327
00:17:07,793 --> 00:17:09,872
I know, a stroke.
Right in front of me.

328
00:17:09,896 --> 00:17:12,697
What if he'd been driving me
in the car when it happened?

329
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:15,533
- Hang on, here's the doctor.
- Hi. So the stroke team

330
00:17:15,635 --> 00:17:17,869
is taking him up to CT.
We're gonna see if he's eligible

331
00:17:17,971 --> 00:17:21,222
for the clot-busting medicine. We caught
the stroke early, which is very good.

332
00:17:21,324 --> 00:17:23,791
So, on a scale of one to ten,

333
00:17:23,893 --> 00:17:27,245
ten being I might have to cancel
our Aspen trip in a week, how is he?

334
00:17:28,481 --> 00:17:30,414
You should cancel the trip.

335
00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:33,167
You will not believe this.

336
00:17:33,269 --> 00:17:35,719
Looks like the blade
landed in the maxillary sinus.

337
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:39,507
Chances are the knife itself is
tamponading any major bleeding.

338
00:17:39,609 --> 00:17:42,059
Probably best just to go
ahead and open up the cranium.

339
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:44,173
Or we could just take him to
the OR and pull this thing out.

340
00:17:44,197 --> 00:17:46,230
Really, Avery? Just pull it out?

341
00:17:46,332 --> 00:17:50,417
Let me guess. You wanna get out of here early
to go to the game just like everyone else.

342
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:53,332
Or, since it looks like the blade
didn't hit any major arteries or veins,

343
00:17:53,356 --> 00:17:56,490
he knows that a controlled
extraction would be both safer

344
00:17:56,592 --> 00:17:58,809
and less invasive than
a complete craniotomy.

345
00:17:58,895 --> 00:18:01,807
Is that true, Avery? That why you
suggest we pull it out of his head?

346
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:05,700
Yeah. And I want to get out of
here early to get to the game.

347
00:18:05,802 --> 00:18:09,136
Me, too. I'm good with that.
Let's just do what he said.

348
00:18:09,238 --> 00:18:12,373
Lexie, I need to speak with you.

349
00:18:13,709 --> 00:18:16,310
Thank you for getting
me out of that room.

350
00:18:16,412 --> 00:18:19,646
I swear, it takes everything just to
be civil to Mark lately. Such an ass.

351
00:18:19,749 --> 00:18:21,827
- What's up?
- Take a look at this. Look closely.

352
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:23,183
What do you see?

353
00:18:23,285 --> 00:18:27,621
This is the patient's admitting
signature when he came in.

354
00:18:27,724 --> 00:18:29,602
And this is his signature
when he was discharged.

355
00:18:29,626 --> 00:18:32,093
- Oh, no.
- Mitch Turner,

356
00:18:32,195 --> 00:18:34,327
the patient you just
discharged, is up in Radiology

357
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:36,163
- being treated for a stroke.
- Oh, God.

358
00:18:36,265 --> 00:18:38,527
I know you know the signs of a
stroke. How did you miss this?

359
00:18:38,551 --> 00:18:40,835
Are you distracted by
the Mark thing? Is that it?

360
00:18:40,936 --> 00:18:42,369
No! I checked the CT.

361
00:18:42,471 --> 00:18:44,755
He was having a classic
migraine, he's had them before.

362
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:47,924
There's no way that he was
having a stroke when I treated him.

363
00:18:48,027 --> 00:18:52,496
Lexie, I know you know. This kind of
headache can be a precursor to a stroke.

364
00:18:52,598 --> 00:18:54,026
When you said you
needed an Ortho consult,

365
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:55,661
you could have mentioned
it was the chief's wife, Grey.

366
00:18:55,685 --> 00:18:58,102
I would have been down
here a hell of a lot sooner.

367
00:19:02,191 --> 00:19:05,376
I am so sorry to keep you waiting,
Mrs. Webber. You hurt your wrist in a fall?

368
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:07,728
It was so silly. I'd
just gotten home

369
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:12,132
and I was trying to get some... Oh!
Reach something on the top shelf.

370
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:15,987
- I just landed wrong.
- Her wrist absorbed
all the impact.

371
00:19:16,089 --> 00:19:19,123
It looks painful. We'll get you some
more pain meds to help with that.

372
00:19:19,225 --> 00:19:23,995
Your X-ray shows a hairline fracture.
So it could have been a lot worse.

373
00:19:24,097 --> 00:19:26,630
We'll splint you up and get
you out of here in no time, OK?

374
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:31,518
You have me paged if
you need anything, OK?

375
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:33,237
OK.

376
00:19:39,212 --> 00:19:42,113
Thank you for covering
for me before with the chief.

377
00:19:42,215 --> 00:19:44,531
- You didn't have to do that.
- Excuse me?

378
00:19:44,633 --> 00:19:47,301
When you said I hadn't
been by to examine you yet.

379
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,874
So you said that you fell

380
00:19:53,977 --> 00:19:59,096
- when you got home... from work.
- Yes, yes, that's right.

381
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,775
Do you remember hitting
your head when you fell?

382
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:03,751
- Not that I recall.
- Dr. Grey?

383
00:20:03,853 --> 00:20:05,263
I have the new X-rays
for Oliver Richter.

384
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:09,356
- OK. Let's get Mrs. Webber
a head CT.
- OK.

385
00:20:11,527 --> 00:20:15,746
Oh, damn it. Excuse me.

386
00:20:20,403 --> 00:20:21,813
- Hey.
- Hey.

387
00:20:21,837 --> 00:20:24,438
- Sorry to make you wait.
- No. No problem.

388
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:26,585
Really, Henry here's
been keeping me company.

389
00:20:26,609 --> 00:20:28,969
Although, he's probably
sick of me by now.

390
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:30,355
I've been grilling him
about the major leagues.

391
00:20:30,379 --> 00:20:32,040
You didn't mention he
used to play pro ball.

392
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:33,709
I... I didn't know that he did.

393
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:35,110
It's not a big deal, really.

394
00:20:35,134 --> 00:20:37,468
Although there is a
baseball card out there

395
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,264
with my face on it somewhere.

396
00:20:39,288 --> 00:20:42,267
I don't mean to hold you guys up.
You probably have a reservation waiting.

397
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:43,924
Excuse me, Dr. Altman.

398
00:20:44,026 --> 00:20:48,312
Mr. Richter, mediastinum looks
borderline on the PA films. Take a look.

399
00:20:50,733 --> 00:20:52,500
OK, um...

400
00:20:52,602 --> 00:20:56,520
That reservation may have to
wait just a little bit longer. I'm sorry.

401
00:20:56,623 --> 00:21:01,374
- If you want to reschedule...
- No! Nonsense. I'm happy to wait.

402
00:21:01,476 --> 00:21:03,144
You are saving lives.

403
00:21:03,246 --> 00:21:05,713
The least I can do is take you
out to dinner when you're done.

404
00:21:05,815 --> 00:21:07,648
Thank you.

405
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:11,151
Did you ever pitch
against Jeff Bagwell?

406
00:21:12,454 --> 00:21:14,121
Once. And it wasn't pretty.

407
00:21:14,223 --> 00:21:17,308
You were right. Get a CT to be safe.
I'll stick around to look the results.

408
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:20,144
At least somebody's
having a good night.

409
00:21:22,548 --> 00:21:27,652
- Tell me.
- No, I can't possibly.

410
00:21:32,424 --> 00:21:34,858
Good news?

411
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,310
Or not such good news.

412
00:21:36,412 --> 00:21:38,732
Oliver, your second
X-ray is still concerning.

413
00:21:38,814 --> 00:21:42,532
Dr. Altman and I agree that you should
have a CT to rule out anything serious.

414
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:46,753
And how long will that take?

415
00:21:46,855 --> 00:21:49,222
Ah, that's my son calling.
He's worried we'll miss tip-off.

416
00:21:49,324 --> 00:21:52,070
What should I tell him? Do I need to
tell him we're gonna miss this game?

417
00:21:52,094 --> 00:21:55,846
I wish I had an answer for you,
but I think it's a safe bet you'll be late.

418
00:21:58,751 --> 00:22:03,020
Max, hey buddy. How's
my little man doing?

419
00:22:03,122 --> 00:22:06,390
Oh, Daddy'll be fine. Don't
you worry. Don't worry.

420
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:08,932
You just worry about all that
popcorn we're gonna be eating.

421
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:12,196
Make sure he's on broad spectrum
antibiotics. You booked an OR?

422
00:22:12,298 --> 00:22:15,466
Wow. It didn't hit any
brain matter at all?

423
00:22:15,567 --> 00:22:17,145
Doesn't look like it from this.

424
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,313
How long till Shepherd gets
down here to take a look?

425
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:19,515
He should be out of
surgery any minute.

426
00:22:19,539 --> 00:22:20,938
Good.

427
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,151
The longer that
thing stays in there,

428
00:22:22,175 --> 00:22:23,540
the higher the risk of infection

429
00:22:23,642 --> 00:22:25,609
or abscess formation.

430
00:22:27,195 --> 00:22:29,045
Ow!

431
00:22:34,587 --> 00:22:37,805
So now can we get out of here?

432
00:22:46,165 --> 00:22:47,365
How is he, Grey?

433
00:22:47,467 --> 00:22:49,883
Pupils are equal and
reactive, he's alert and awake.

434
00:22:49,985 --> 00:22:52,336
Can I get some more
gauze for this wound, please?

435
00:22:52,438 --> 00:22:55,739
- Reflexes seem normal.
- Gimme that.

436
00:22:55,841 --> 00:22:58,241
I'm fine. It's just a
little headache is all.

437
00:22:58,343 --> 00:23:00,088
I've had hangovers
worse than this.

438
00:23:00,112 --> 00:23:01,690
What's the status on the blade?

439
00:23:01,714 --> 00:23:02,529
Well, about that...

440
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:04,531
Yeah, there is no blade anymore.

441
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:08,001
What happened? Sir, just lay
back. Let me examine you, OK?

442
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:12,605
Can you get a doctor, please?

443
00:23:12,708 --> 00:23:15,926
I wanna look at the CTs.

444
00:23:19,131 --> 00:23:21,665
- It's gonna be OK, Nathan.
- He's really hurting.

445
00:23:21,767 --> 00:23:24,034
OK. I'm gonna write an
order for more pain meds.

446
00:23:24,136 --> 00:23:27,070
It's OK, monkey. I know
you wanna go home.

447
00:23:27,172 --> 00:23:29,890
It'll just be a little
while longer, OK?

448
00:23:29,992 --> 00:23:32,576
It will be just a
little longer, right?

449
00:23:32,678 --> 00:23:35,746
- Tyler, where is
the OR for Nathan?
- I haven't heard back yet.

450
00:23:35,848 --> 00:23:38,288
OK, well, let's call them again,
and let's call the Ortho team

451
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:40,500
and make sure they're
ready to go. OK?

452
00:23:40,602 --> 00:23:44,621
We will get to Nathan as
soon as possible, I promise.

453
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:50,261
- How's he doing?
- The blade went
through his skull,

454
00:23:50,363 --> 00:23:52,457
didn't hit any major nerves
or arteries. He's gonna be fine.

455
00:23:52,481 --> 00:23:53,347
- Flesh wound?
- Yeah.

456
00:23:53,449 --> 00:23:54,848
That's the luckiest guy alive.

457
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:56,383
You're also pretty lucky, too.

458
00:23:56,485 --> 00:23:58,365
It's past 6:30, and we
haven't had our date yet.

459
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:00,170
I'm swamped. I can't leave.

460
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:02,501
I have one patient in CT,
another one waiting for an OR.

461
00:24:02,525 --> 00:24:04,725
- Your patient's CT
isn't ready yet.
- No.

462
00:24:04,811 --> 00:24:06,438
And the OR you're
waiting for isn't either.

463
00:24:06,462 --> 00:24:10,180
So OK, I mean, maybe I do,
right at this precise moment,

464
00:24:10,283 --> 00:24:12,961
- have one minute,
but it's a minute.
- That's perfect.

465
00:24:12,985 --> 00:24:15,302
That's all I need. Just a
minute. I need a minute.

466
00:24:16,322 --> 00:24:17,888
Hey.

467
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:21,758
- Wha..?
- Oh, sorry!

468
00:24:21,861 --> 00:24:25,896
- What?!
- No one. It was nothing. That room is occupied.

469
00:24:25,998 --> 00:24:27,926
Never ask me what I might have
seen or might not have seen in there.

470
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:30,534
OK, well, if we can't go in
there, where are we gonna go?

471
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:32,453
I have an idea.

472
00:24:36,859 --> 00:24:39,121
- Where are we going?
- Nowhere. We're gonna do it here.

473
00:24:39,145 --> 00:24:41,211
- We...? No, we're not!
- Come on.

474
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:43,396
No! No way! Are you kidding me?

475
00:24:43,498 --> 00:24:45,699
Drop your pants.

476
00:24:45,801 --> 00:24:46,633
Come on, I'll be
quick. I'll be in and out.

477
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:49,736
Oh, my God! Eyes up here!

478
00:24:49,838 --> 00:24:53,001
- Seriously, are you kidding me?
- I'm serious about this. Where
is your sense of adventure?

479
00:24:53,025 --> 00:24:54,953
My sense of adventure
is down on the first floor.

480
00:24:54,977 --> 00:24:57,110
- It's not in this elevator.
- Come on.

481
00:24:57,212 --> 00:24:59,830
If not for me, then do it for
your future baby. Come on.

482
00:24:59,932 --> 00:25:03,133
- Turn around.
- I cannot believe
I am doing this.

483
00:25:03,235 --> 00:25:08,488
This future, imaginary baby
of ours better be worth it.

484
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,390
OK, here we go.

485
00:25:11,727 --> 00:25:14,395
- Oh, there it is.
- Ouch.

486
00:25:14,497 --> 00:25:18,132
Ooh. There. I told
you I'd be quick.

487
00:25:19,535 --> 00:25:21,635
I can't wait to meet our
future, fictitious baby.

488
00:25:21,737 --> 00:25:24,921
Me either.

489
00:25:30,979 --> 00:25:34,632
We got through those charts
fast. Floor seats, here I come.

490
00:25:34,734 --> 00:25:37,268
So I just helped you get
through three dozen charts

491
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:40,682
in a fraction of the time it would
have taken you to do on your own,

492
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:44,008
basically ensuring you get
to your floor seats on time.

493
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:47,778
How long do I have to wait till you
ask me to go to the game with you?

494
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,646
Oh...

495
00:25:49,748 --> 00:25:52,850
I mean, I was supposed to
take Avery, but screw him.

496
00:25:52,952 --> 00:25:55,419
Sure. You wanna go?

497
00:25:55,521 --> 00:25:57,282
No, I'm on call
tonight, actually.

498
00:25:57,306 --> 00:26:00,190
I just wanted to see if I
could get you to ask me out.

499
00:26:02,044 --> 00:26:03,911
Excuse me.

500
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:14,087
- Just admit it. You like her.
- Shut up.

501
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:15,989
I don't think you do
understand, actually.

502
00:26:16,091 --> 00:26:17,824
This has been going
on since yesterday.

503
00:26:17,926 --> 00:26:21,478
We took our son to an after-hours
clinic, where he was misdiagnosed

504
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:24,476
and then he was sent home without so much
as a painkiller. He was up all night crying.

505
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,133
This morning, our
pediatrician sent us here

506
00:26:27,236 --> 00:26:31,472
and now we've been waiting around
all day with our four-year-old son.

507
00:26:31,574 --> 00:26:34,386
Believe me, I understand a kid with
a broken leg doesn't take precedence

508
00:26:34,410 --> 00:26:37,244
over a guy with a knife in
his head, but my son is scared.

509
00:26:37,346 --> 00:26:41,081
And he is in pain. So could somebody
please just get to his leg already?

510
00:26:41,183 --> 00:26:43,850
- Please.
- Yes, sir.

511
00:26:45,704 --> 00:26:48,956
You still haven't helped that kid
yet? He's four with a femur fracture.

512
00:26:49,058 --> 00:26:51,778
- You know how much that hurts?
- I know, it's just one of those
days.

513
00:26:51,811 --> 00:26:54,577
- Tyler, isn't that OR
ready yet?
- They're prepping it now.

514
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:57,797
Grey! My wife was
cleared by Dr. Torres.

515
00:26:57,899 --> 00:27:00,383
You ordered a head
CT for a broken wrist?

516
00:27:00,469 --> 00:27:02,513
- I can explain. I have some...
- Dr. Grey, they're calling
from CT.

517
00:27:02,537 --> 00:27:04,657
- Your patient
is coding in the scanner.
- What?!

518
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:06,156
They say he's coding!

519
00:27:20,489 --> 00:27:23,624
Hold CPR!

520
00:27:23,726 --> 00:27:25,325
V-fib! Page Altman!

521
00:27:25,427 --> 00:27:27,860
Give me the paddles
now! Charge to 200!

522
00:27:27,963 --> 00:27:29,813
Clear!

523
00:27:33,986 --> 00:27:37,487
Charge to 300! Clear!

524
00:27:40,943 --> 00:27:42,893
- Got a pulse!
- Yes!

525
00:27:42,995 --> 00:27:44,656
- Scans are up!
- Grey, talk to me.

526
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,696
He was coding when I got here.

527
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:50,116
I defibrillated him three times,
I gave him three rounds of epi,

528
00:27:50,218 --> 00:27:52,536
two of atropine, I loaded
him up with amiodarone.

529
00:27:52,638 --> 00:27:54,988
But he's tachycardic now,
he's barely hanging on.

530
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:56,885
- He needs surgery. Book an OR.
- OK.

531
00:27:56,909 --> 00:27:59,320
- I'll get a room
prepped and ready.
- No time.

532
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:01,995
His aorta is dissecting
as we speak.

533
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:04,937
- He needs surgery right now.
- They're saying all the ORs
are booked.

534
00:28:04,967 --> 00:28:07,718
Well, tell them to bump someone
because we're coming up either way.

535
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:11,204
I have an OR. Tell them to bump
mine and prep it for an emergency cardio.

536
00:28:11,306 --> 00:28:14,508
All right, here
we go. Got it? Go.

537
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:16,393
All right, let's clear it.

538
00:28:20,616 --> 00:28:22,399
Let's hold that elevator!

539
00:28:34,413 --> 00:28:36,996
- Come on, come on, come on!
- Once these doors open,

540
00:28:37,116 --> 00:28:41,485
we're gonna have to get him in the
OR and open him as soon as possible.

541
00:28:41,587 --> 00:28:43,936
- I know.
- Even then,

542
00:28:44,039 --> 00:28:48,392
if that aorta tears, we
may already be too late.

543
00:28:50,796 --> 00:28:53,730
- We're not gonna
have time to scrub.
- I know, I know.

544
00:28:55,718 --> 00:28:57,384
Thanks.

545
00:29:15,371 --> 00:29:17,481
Just pour the betadine
straight onto the chest.

546
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:20,124
It doesn't need to be pretty.
We need to get in there.

547
00:29:28,883 --> 00:29:30,650
All right, plug me in.

548
00:29:36,859 --> 00:29:38,441
Scalpel.

549
00:29:40,295 --> 00:29:41,478
Cautery.

550
00:29:46,802 --> 00:29:50,487
Cauterizing now. Get in there
quickly, Grey. Time is myocardium.

551
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:53,339
All right, saw.

552
00:29:55,477 --> 00:29:56,827
Get that retractor ready.

553
00:29:58,597 --> 00:30:00,258
This guy thought he had
a bad case of heartburn.

554
00:30:00,282 --> 00:30:03,149
He went from that to this
in less than 45 minutes.

555
00:30:03,251 --> 00:30:05,252
That's how these work.
How's his pressure?

556
00:30:05,354 --> 00:30:07,254
Seventies, and dropping.

557
00:30:09,274 --> 00:30:13,076
Retractor! Every beat of his
heart rips this tear a little bit wider.

558
00:30:13,862 --> 00:30:15,195
All right.

559
00:30:15,297 --> 00:30:16,724
How many of these
ruptured dissections

560
00:30:16,748 --> 00:30:18,142
have you caught
in time to operate?

561
00:30:18,166 --> 00:30:19,416
Forty, maybe 50.

562
00:30:19,518 --> 00:30:20,945
How many have you
been able to save?

563
00:30:20,969 --> 00:30:22,869
Three.

564
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:30,677
All right, I'm in.

565
00:30:33,649 --> 00:30:35,577
- Oh, no, no, no, no!
- Damn it!

566
00:30:35,601 --> 00:30:37,701
He's bleeding out!

567
00:30:37,803 --> 00:30:42,756
His aorta's wide open. Clamp!
Come on, come on, come on!

568
00:30:42,858 --> 00:30:44,891
All right, Grey, let's
try sucker bypass.

569
00:30:44,993 --> 00:30:46,659
OK.

570
00:30:46,761 --> 00:30:48,178
Cannulas!

571
00:30:54,136 --> 00:30:56,046
It's not working.
There's too much blood.

572
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:58,522
Once we get him on bypass,
it'll be easier to control.

573
00:30:59,808 --> 00:31:01,841
Heart's fibrillating!

574
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,578
All right, cardiac massage!

575
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:09,449
- Paddles!
- I've almost got him
cannulated.

576
00:31:09,551 --> 00:31:10,684
Charge to ten.

577
00:31:10,786 --> 00:31:12,819
Clear!

578
00:31:17,693 --> 00:31:20,877
Damn it. He's bleeding
out of his nose and ears!

579
00:31:20,979 --> 00:31:22,924
I've been loading him up
with blood, FFP and Factor VII,

580
00:31:22,948 --> 00:31:25,982
- but I can't keep up
with the losses.
- Foley's full of blood, too.

581
00:31:26,084 --> 00:31:27,817
DIC. His cannula
sites are oozing.

582
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:30,320
Let's push three of epi.
Set me up for another shock.

583
00:31:36,211 --> 00:31:37,394
Clear!

584
00:31:40,816 --> 00:31:42,776
- Damn it!
- Well, what can we do?

585
00:31:42,851 --> 00:31:45,735
- Just tell me what to do.
- Nothing. His aorta is in shreds.

586
00:31:45,837 --> 00:31:49,106
- Well, what about...?
- There is nothing left to do. Call it.

587
00:31:50,692 --> 00:31:52,326
- Call it, Grey.
- No...

588
00:31:52,428 --> 00:31:56,579
Grey, we got here too late. These
are almost impossible to catch.

589
00:31:56,681 --> 00:31:59,149
There's nothing that
we can do. I'm sorry.

590
00:31:59,251 --> 00:32:00,767
We need to call it.

591
00:32:19,421 --> 00:32:22,221
Time of death, 18:52.

592
00:32:45,497 --> 00:32:48,498
Hey. I heard you lost a patient.

593
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:01,078
You know, it's not that I
don't want to share you.

594
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:04,297
I mean, I don't want to share
you, but that's not the reason

595
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,499
I don't want you to be
Callie's baby's godmother.

596
00:33:06,601 --> 00:33:08,601
Oh...

597
00:33:09,171 --> 00:33:10,736
OK.

598
00:33:12,174 --> 00:33:15,007
It just seems like if you agree
to be Callie's baby's godmother,

599
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:19,262
you're saying that I'll never
have a baby of my own.

600
00:33:19,364 --> 00:33:22,965
Meredith, you know I am
in no way saying anything...

601
00:33:23,068 --> 00:33:26,202
I know. It just feels that way.

602
00:33:27,305 --> 00:33:30,256
OK.

603
00:33:41,970 --> 00:33:44,904
Well, I...

604
00:33:45,006 --> 00:33:48,408
have to go have a really
uncomfortable conversation with Callie.

605
00:33:50,596 --> 00:33:53,230
How about you?
What are you up to?

606
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:58,768
I have to go contact
Oliver's family.

607
00:34:01,422 --> 00:34:04,240
Oh, hey, wait. You've got...

608
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:06,910
blood or something.

609
00:34:06,995 --> 00:34:09,045
All right.

610
00:34:10,181 --> 00:34:13,366
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

611
00:34:20,525 --> 00:34:21,808
Hey, chief.

612
00:34:23,946 --> 00:34:26,146
- About earlier...
- It's all taken care of.

613
00:34:26,248 --> 00:34:29,082
I checked Adele's head
CT myself. It was clean.

614
00:34:29,184 --> 00:34:31,262
Her wrist is in a splint, and
I'm taking her home now.

615
00:34:31,286 --> 00:34:34,086
I still have some concerns.
And if her CT was clean,

616
00:34:34,188 --> 00:34:36,266
- then I have
even more concerns...
- Thank you, Meredith,

617
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:38,008
but I assure you, Adele is fine.

618
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:40,677
Chief, she's been getting
things very confused.

619
00:34:40,779 --> 00:34:43,630
Meredith, she is fine. And
I'm taking her home right now.

620
00:34:43,732 --> 00:34:46,782
Why was she getting Christmas
decorations down in February?

621
00:34:46,884 --> 00:34:49,101
- Good night, Meredith.
- She said she'd just

622
00:34:49,203 --> 00:34:51,054
gotten home from
work. Didn't she retire?

623
00:34:51,156 --> 00:34:52,916
- Meredith...
- Chief, something isn't right.

624
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:55,307
OK, that's enough. I know
what you are implying,

625
00:34:55,410 --> 00:34:58,361
and while I appreciate
your concern, that's enough!

626
00:34:58,463 --> 00:35:01,264
Adele had a scare
today. She had a fall.

627
00:35:01,366 --> 00:35:04,662
Any number of things could account
for her mixing up a couple of details,

628
00:35:04,686 --> 00:35:07,938
not the least of which is
her being interrogated by you!

629
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:11,390
If something bigger were wrong
with my wife, I would know it.

630
00:35:11,492 --> 00:35:14,560
You've got Alzheimer's
on the brain.

631
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:18,548
You buy a car, you start
seeing it everywhere you look.

632
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:23,519
You've been working on this
Alzheimer's trial 24/7, I get it.

633
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:26,956
But Adele is not
your mother, Meredith.

634
00:35:27,058 --> 00:35:28,340
She's my wife.

635
00:35:31,763 --> 00:35:33,996
Now, good night.

636
00:35:44,575 --> 00:35:46,642
Hi. I am so sorry,

637
00:35:46,744 --> 00:35:49,745
I got pulled into an
emergency surgery.

638
00:35:49,848 --> 00:35:53,583
- Where is Nathan?
- Actually, a doctor
came by to get him

639
00:35:53,685 --> 00:35:56,319
a little bit ago. He's getting
his casts put on right now.

640
00:35:56,421 --> 00:35:59,055
Great. That's great news.

641
00:36:02,026 --> 00:36:04,994
Dr. Grey, we have a surgical
abdomen in bed three...

642
00:36:05,096 --> 00:36:08,798
- Let's just get
Oliver Richter's chart.
- OK.

643
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:30,886
Hello?

644
00:36:32,557 --> 00:36:34,790
Hi, Max.

645
00:36:34,892 --> 00:36:39,462
This... No, it's
your daddy's doctor.

646
00:36:39,564 --> 00:36:41,931
Is your mom around?

647
00:36:44,168 --> 00:36:45,835
An hour.

648
00:36:47,372 --> 00:36:49,071
One hour...

649
00:36:50,242 --> 00:36:52,542
can change everything.

650
00:36:55,747 --> 00:36:57,614
Forever.

651
00:36:59,284 --> 00:37:01,061
We'll have to keep you
overnight for observation,

652
00:37:01,085 --> 00:37:04,920
- but your prognosis
is very good.
- Great!

653
00:37:05,022 --> 00:37:08,358
So maybe we don't have to
cancel our Aspen trip after all.

654
00:37:10,094 --> 00:37:13,780
- I just had a stroke.
- I know.

655
00:37:13,882 --> 00:37:16,066
And you're worried
about our travel plans?

656
00:37:17,969 --> 00:37:19,519
It's a non-refundable trip.

657
00:37:21,789 --> 00:37:23,223
Cancel the trip.

658
00:37:23,325 --> 00:37:26,642
You know what? In
fact, cancel all our trips.

659
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:29,295
How have I put up
with you for two years?

660
00:37:29,397 --> 00:37:31,114
I am done with this.

661
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:38,938
We're done. Get out of here.

662
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:42,525
Now, before you give
me another stroke.

663
00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:43,893
Wait, wait.

664
00:37:47,448 --> 00:37:49,432
Can I see your keys?

665
00:37:51,803 --> 00:37:53,453
OK...

666
00:37:55,407 --> 00:37:57,057
Here.

667
00:38:02,998 --> 00:38:06,165
OK. Now you can go.

668
00:38:15,026 --> 00:38:17,760
An hour can save your life.

669
00:38:20,598 --> 00:38:24,567
So before he gets off the phone, and
since I now have to go pee in a cup,

670
00:38:24,669 --> 00:38:25,789
I just have to say this.

671
00:38:25,887 --> 00:38:27,587
I basically spent the past hour

672
00:38:27,689 --> 00:38:29,089
on a first date
with William myself,

673
00:38:29,157 --> 00:38:31,307
and I don't know how much
you know about the guy,

674
00:38:31,409 --> 00:38:33,676
but this is what I know.

675
00:38:33,778 --> 00:38:36,546
He wears driving gloves.

676
00:38:36,648 --> 00:38:38,782
Yeah, and he doesn't
live with his mother,

677
00:38:38,884 --> 00:38:41,200
but until recently, he
lived above her house.

678
00:38:41,302 --> 00:38:44,537
And he used the word "shan't",
and he wasn't being funny.

679
00:38:44,639 --> 00:38:48,107
And he's yet to tell me a story about
himself in which he is not the hero.

680
00:38:48,209 --> 00:38:52,779
So, as your husband, I
think we can do better.

681
00:38:52,881 --> 00:38:56,015
Good news. Not only was I
able to push the reservation,

682
00:38:56,117 --> 00:39:00,337
but I also got us a table by the
window. Black truffle gnocchi awaits.

683
00:39:00,439 --> 00:39:03,839
- Ready?
- Ready.

684
00:39:12,334 --> 00:39:15,101
An hour can change your mind.

685
00:39:22,543 --> 00:39:23,783
OK. So when's your next break?

686
00:39:23,878 --> 00:39:25,645
OK, uh-uh, no...

687
00:39:25,747 --> 00:39:31,601
This will never
happen again at work.

688
00:39:31,703 --> 00:39:33,853
- Understood?
- Sure.

689
00:39:33,955 --> 00:39:35,572
OK.

690
00:39:38,076 --> 00:39:39,308
Until your next break.

691
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:41,022
Sometimes an hour is just a gift

692
00:39:41,046 --> 00:39:42,344
we give ourselves.

693
00:39:42,447 --> 00:39:44,191
All right, Stewart,
you're choosing to leave

694
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:45,347
against medical advice,

695
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:47,178
so you're free to go,
but this is my number.

696
00:39:47,202 --> 00:39:50,553
If you experience any of the
neurological symptoms on this sheet,

697
00:39:50,655 --> 00:39:53,823
you call me. Somebody
should stay with you tonight,

698
00:39:53,925 --> 00:39:56,292
and have plenty
of fluids. Not beer!

699
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:59,061
- Not beer.
- Will do, doc.

700
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:02,476
- Thanks, doc.
- All right.

701
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,834
For some, an hour can
mean almost nothing.

702
00:40:04,936 --> 00:40:07,704
I can't believe he walked
in with a knife in his head,

703
00:40:07,805 --> 00:40:10,473
and is walking out an hour
later to go to a ball game.

704
00:40:10,575 --> 00:40:14,711
Speaking of which, any chance
you wanna go to the game, too?

705
00:40:14,813 --> 00:40:18,448
Apparently, Karev
didn't want his floor seats.

706
00:40:19,551 --> 00:40:20,750
So you interested?

707
00:40:23,205 --> 00:40:26,472
Actually, yes. Yes, I am.

708
00:40:30,278 --> 00:40:32,679
For others,

709
00:40:32,781 --> 00:40:35,048
an hour makes all the
difference in the world.

710
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:41,003
Now, Nathan, when you wake up, you're
gonna have two big casts on your legs.

711
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:45,357
But that's a good thing, because it
means it's gonna make your leg better, OK?

712
00:40:45,477 --> 00:40:49,579
But right now, I have a very
important question for you.

713
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:54,284
And that is, what is
your favorite color?

714
00:40:55,787 --> 00:40:57,070
Blue.

715
00:40:58,323 --> 00:40:59,672
Blue it is, then.

716
00:40:59,774 --> 00:41:03,042
Let's prep the blue
casting material, please.

717
00:41:04,478 --> 00:41:07,880
All right, I'm gonna take this
mask, Nathan. I'm gonna lower it.

718
00:41:07,982 --> 00:41:10,182
And you have to count...

719
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:20,660
But in the end...

720
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:25,798
it's still just an hour.

721
00:41:34,675 --> 00:41:37,210
One of many.

722
00:41:38,813 --> 00:41:41,381
Many more to come.

723
00:41:44,119 --> 00:41:45,785
Sixty minutes.

724
00:41:45,887 --> 00:41:49,022
Thirty-six hundred seconds.

725
00:41:51,793 --> 00:41:53,826
That's it.

726
00:41:58,633 --> 00:42:02,117
Then it starts all over again.

727
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:06,723
Hi. I'm Dr. Grey. I'll
be your doctor today.

728
00:42:06,825 --> 00:42:09,169
It says here you've been
experiencing some abdominal pain.

729
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:12,428
When did that start?

730
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:15,732
And who knows what
the next hour might hold?
