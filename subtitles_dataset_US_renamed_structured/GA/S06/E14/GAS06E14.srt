1
00:00:04,604 --> 00:00:07,723
<i>The surgical scalpel
is made of sterilized,</i>

2
00:00:07,825 --> 00:00:10,875
<i>carbonized stainless steel.</i>

3
00:00:10,977 --> 00:00:13,846
<i>This is a vast improvement
over the first scalpel,</i>

4
00:00:13,947 --> 00:00:16,097
<i>which was pretty
much a sharp stick.</i>

5
00:00:16,217 --> 00:00:19,118
<i>Medicine is constantly
reinventing itself.</i>

6
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:22,670
<i>That means surgeons have to
keep reinventing themselves, too.</i>

7
00:00:22,772 --> 00:00:24,052
I can't believe
we're doing this.

8
00:00:24,141 --> 00:00:25,518
It's Valentine's Day.

9
00:00:25,542 --> 00:00:27,353
We don't do Valentine's Day.

10
00:00:27,377 --> 00:00:30,073
- More to life
than the hospital.
- No, there isn't.

11
00:00:30,097 --> 00:00:32,131
- It's romantic.
- No, it isn't.

12
00:00:32,233 --> 00:00:35,150
<i>There's constant pressure
to adapt to changes.</i>

13
00:00:36,553 --> 00:00:38,937
- Ambulance!
- <i>It can be a painful process.</i>

14
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,657
- Eyes front, ladies.
- <i>But without it...</i>

15
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:50,348
- OK, that seemed big.
- If it's big, they'll page us.

16
00:00:54,738 --> 00:00:56,722
- It's big.
- Yes!

17
00:00:56,824 --> 00:01:00,759
<i>You'll find yourself moving
backwards, instead of forwards.</i>

18
00:01:07,701 --> 00:01:10,168
- What's going on?
- Grandinetti's roof collapsed.

19
00:01:10,271 --> 00:01:13,049
We'll be getting more than a dozen.
All scheduled procedures are pushed.

20
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:16,007
On Valentine's Day? Grandinetti's
must have been packed.

21
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:18,543
Well, tonight's out. I told
you this would happen.

22
00:01:18,646 --> 00:01:22,381
That's why we went to dinner
at four, and exchanged gifts.

23
00:01:23,651 --> 00:01:26,918
Just special. Original.
Magical. Squeals of joy.

24
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:29,537
- Wow, Scrooge!
- Scrooge is Christmas.

25
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:32,591
- That's a holiday.
- Dr. Bailey.

26
00:01:32,693 --> 00:01:34,910
My hemicolectomy is
pushed. It's a shame.

27
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:36,923
I was really looking
forward to that.

28
00:01:36,947 --> 00:01:38,714
Well, that's... You know...

29
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:41,583
Maybe we could make
up for it. Dinner tomorrow?

30
00:01:41,685 --> 00:01:42,917
No! I...

31
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:45,036
Just... I'm busy.

32
00:01:45,121 --> 00:01:48,841
I have surgeries most
nights. I always have surgery.

33
00:01:48,925 --> 00:01:50,925
Right. Well, um...

34
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:52,978
Maybe see you in the OR, then.

35
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:06,108
Oh, my God. She likes him.

36
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:07,592
Oh!

37
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:10,323
- You like him?
- You should totally
go out with him.

38
00:02:10,347 --> 00:02:12,559
- You have to say yes!
- It's Valentine's Day! You have to!

39
00:02:12,583 --> 00:02:15,551
OK, see? This, right
here, what's happening,

40
00:02:15,653 --> 00:02:19,287
with the giggling, the
girl talk, the OMGs...

41
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:22,541
OK, it has to stop. I am busy.

42
00:02:28,716 --> 00:02:30,315
Hey, Torres.

43
00:02:30,417 --> 00:02:32,784
Do you know anything
about putting together cribs?

44
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:35,454
- You bought a crib?
- Sloan's coming home tonight.

45
00:02:35,555 --> 00:02:38,457
And I got it put together,
but it wobbles. It can't wobble.

46
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:40,359
Will you take a look at it?

47
00:02:40,461 --> 00:02:44,963
You're like a sweet, nerdy dad,
now. I don't even recognize you.

48
00:02:45,065 --> 00:02:47,799
- Who's the blonde?
- I don't know.

49
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:51,787
I may be a dad, but
I am a single dad.

50
00:02:51,889 --> 00:02:54,957
Excuse me.

51
00:02:55,059 --> 00:02:57,575
OK, now I recognize you.

52
00:02:57,677 --> 00:03:00,596
It must, uh, suck to
work on Valentine's Day.

53
00:03:00,698 --> 00:03:02,714
I don't believe we've met.

54
00:03:02,816 --> 00:03:04,983
Aah!

55
00:03:05,085 --> 00:03:08,036
- What did you do to your hair?!
- I changed it.

56
00:03:08,138 --> 00:03:10,172
I colored it. I just...

57
00:03:10,274 --> 00:03:13,074
Wait, you thought I
was someone else.

58
00:03:13,176 --> 00:03:15,288
You didn't know it was me,
and you were hitting on me?

59
00:03:15,312 --> 00:03:18,564
No, I pretty much thought
you were some blonde.

60
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:20,532
You are pathetic.

61
00:03:20,634 --> 00:03:22,600
And hypocritical.

62
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:25,136
- And slutty.
- And you are no blonde.

63
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:29,157
You can't pull that off. Blondes
are either bad-ass or fun.

64
00:03:29,276 --> 00:03:32,260
And you're... you're a brunette.

65
00:03:35,933 --> 00:03:37,966
- Damn!
- Shut up!

66
00:03:47,428 --> 00:03:50,061
Quit staring. I'm probably
gonna change it back anyway.

67
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:53,081
No, I get it. You get
dumped by your boyfriend,

68
00:03:53,183 --> 00:03:55,128
and you go for the extreme
makeover. Chicks always do that.

69
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:58,303
I didn't get dumped. I
did not do this for Mark.

70
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:00,989
I just... It's Valentine's Day,

71
00:04:01,091 --> 00:04:04,475
and I wanted to change
something, and I could change...

72
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:09,164
I wanted to do something
for me. OK? This was for me.

73
00:04:09,266 --> 00:04:11,216
How is that different
than what I just said?

74
00:04:14,321 --> 00:04:15,537
I'm changing it back.

75
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:18,757
Watch that rock, please.

76
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:21,058
This is medic 16...

77
00:04:21,161 --> 00:04:22,927
Restaurant roof collapse.

78
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:25,191
So far a penetrating abdominal
injury, a sucking chest wound

79
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:26,926
- and a massive head wound.
- To the left!

80
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:29,813
- There's an open
fracture on the way.
- You're still here.

81
00:04:29,837 --> 00:04:32,638
If you're here, I'm here. An OSHA
investigator is waiting in the lobby

82
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,840
and also two TV crews
are asking for a statement.

83
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:36,920
- I told them to wait for you.
- We cleared the OR board.

84
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:39,978
Also, I paged Bailey, Nelson,
Altman, Hagan and Sloan.

85
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,580
- I'll get...
- Stop! Who do I see first?

86
00:04:42,683 --> 00:04:44,716
- Skull fracture, trauma one.
- The OSHA guy.

87
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:46,963
- Chart, please.
- - Get as many people as possible

88
00:04:46,987 --> 00:04:50,489
off the backboard, clear C-spines
clinically but if you're not sure,

89
00:04:50,591 --> 00:04:52,352
wait for X-ray, no matter
how backed up they are.

90
00:04:52,376 --> 00:04:55,210
- Hold the elevator!
- I got it!

91
00:04:55,312 --> 00:04:56,678
Trauma four is open.

92
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:59,014
- Bring the chart, please.
- Right away.

93
00:04:59,116 --> 00:05:02,918
- Where are they
taking my husband?
- He's going into surgery.

94
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:05,837
His doctors will let us know more
soon. Take a deep breath for me?

95
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:08,268
- What do we have, Grey?
- Decreased breath sounds
on the left,

96
00:05:08,292 --> 00:05:11,012
- possibly a pneumothorax.
- Put in a chest tube
if you need to.

97
00:05:11,077 --> 00:05:13,797
Evaluate and page
me if it's surgical.

98
00:05:13,847 --> 00:05:15,497
- Sorry.
- I'm sorry.

99
00:05:18,001 --> 00:05:19,784
OK, let me see the chart.

100
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:21,169
Looks like a pretty bad break.

101
00:05:21,271 --> 00:05:23,316
You're gonna have
to have that reset.

102
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,056
I wonder if there's any chance

103
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,592
you could put me in
a bed next to that lady.

104
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:29,975
Yeah, sorry, it
doesn't work like that.

105
00:05:31,598 --> 00:05:33,898
Of course. Forgive me.

106
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:38,003
I've been a head
waiter for 25 years.

107
00:05:38,104 --> 00:05:39,971
I know how it works.

108
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:43,558
I'll see what I can do.

109
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:46,511
Depressed skull fracture
with a subdural hematoma.

110
00:05:46,613 --> 00:05:48,246
All right? Book an OR.

111
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:49,825
- Chief.
- Yeah.

112
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:52,228
Reassign some anesthesiologists.
You're being cupid for Bailey.

113
00:05:52,252 --> 00:05:53,997
I don't do that. I did that
once, she yelled at me.

114
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:55,298
I'll be cupid. You
just be the chief.

115
00:05:55,322 --> 00:05:57,022
- I am not cupid.
- Sign.

116
00:05:57,124 --> 00:05:59,757
Dr. Shepherd, the reporters
are waiting for a statement.

117
00:05:59,843 --> 00:06:02,171
- I have surgery.
- Actually, Dr. Nelson said
he can take your skull fracture.

118
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:04,941
You've got the trustees' breakfast in
the morning, and when the trustees

119
00:06:04,965 --> 00:06:07,710
turn on the 11:00 news, it's
your face they'll want to see.

120
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:11,119
- Clear the hallway!
- Will do.

121
00:06:12,488 --> 00:06:15,106
- Watch it, coming through!
- I've got the arm.

122
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,641
What do you got?

123
00:06:16,744 --> 00:06:18,454
Traumatic amputation
through the left distal humerus,

124
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:20,656
bleeding controlled with
pressure. Got ten of morphine

125
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,548
- and vital signs are stable.
- Get him in Trauma Three.

126
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:25,634
Put him on a monitor,
push two of O neg!

127
00:06:25,736 --> 00:06:28,402
- Grey, Avery, you're with me.
- Chief Shepherd?

128
00:06:32,993 --> 00:06:34,359
Shepherd!

129
00:06:34,461 --> 00:06:36,981
What about the
fact that this...?

130
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,812
Can she have some water, please?

131
00:06:42,836 --> 00:06:44,836
I'm afraid she can't.

132
00:06:44,938 --> 00:06:47,805
Emile, stop.

133
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:51,543
My husband and I have
been going to Grandinetti's

134
00:06:51,645 --> 00:06:53,645
for 15 years.

135
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:55,346
Every Friday night.

136
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:56,815
And sometimes Tuesdays.

137
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:01,068
Emile always takes
very good care of us.

138
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:04,772
But now it's time to
look after yourself.

139
00:07:05,976 --> 00:07:08,243
I just thought you'd
want someone with you,

140
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:10,728
until you find out that
Mr. Banks was OK.

141
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:13,431
Thank you.

142
00:07:15,252 --> 00:07:18,086
My patient's
stalking your patient.

143
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:20,621
He's being a good waiter. And
apparently, we're his busboys.

144
00:07:20,723 --> 00:07:23,419
Dude gave me 50 bucks to put him
next to her. He's got the hots for her.

145
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:26,644
Her husband is in
surgery. She's married.

146
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:29,281
You're saying that 'cause
you think you're married.

147
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:32,717
His 50 bucks says he
makes a move. You in or out?

148
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,919
I'm in. And I am married.

149
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:37,856
- Mrs. Shepherd?
- Huh?

150
00:07:38,842 --> 00:07:41,593
- I'm not Mrs. Shepherd.
- You're not?

151
00:07:41,695 --> 00:07:45,213
- I'm Dr. Grey.
- Right. Right.

152
00:07:45,315 --> 00:07:48,076
Um, Chief Shepherd wanted me to
ask you about the trustees' breakfast.

153
00:07:48,151 --> 00:07:50,735
You Shepherd's flunky? Is
that why he hired you back?

154
00:07:50,837 --> 00:07:53,905
I'm on his service this week.
And during this transition,

155
00:07:54,007 --> 00:07:56,491
he needed a little more help
on the administrative side.

156
00:07:56,593 --> 00:07:58,777
I'm not his flunky.

157
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,712
So will you be going with him to
the breakfast or meeting him there?

158
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:06,417
I, um... am not sure I'm going.

159
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,519
Well...

160
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:11,139
You have to. You're his wife.

161
00:08:17,898 --> 00:08:19,831
Sloan? When did you get in?

162
00:08:19,933 --> 00:08:22,833
- Does Mark know you're here?
- No. My flight
got in a little early.

163
00:08:22,935 --> 00:08:25,286
And I took a cab over.
I didn't want to bug him.

164
00:08:25,388 --> 00:08:27,488
Somebody said that you
guys have a free clinic.

165
00:08:27,591 --> 00:08:29,908
- Do you know where that is?
- Is everything OK?

166
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:33,277
Yeah, I just want someone to check
me out after the surgery and everything.

167
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:36,897
- Maybe give me an ultrasound.
- The clinic closed an hour ago.

168
00:08:39,002 --> 00:08:41,336
Come on, I have a second.

169
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:42,636
I'll take a peek for you.

170
00:08:42,738 --> 00:08:44,605
I need another four-by-four.

171
00:08:44,707 --> 00:08:47,641
Dress him, I'm gonna take
another look at the arm.

172
00:08:47,743 --> 00:08:49,810
His wound's completely
macerated and contaminated.

173
00:08:49,912 --> 00:08:51,579
Why wasn't this
guy brought in first?

174
00:08:51,681 --> 00:08:55,111
He was lying in dirty dishwater
for a while before they found him.

175
00:08:55,135 --> 00:08:58,553
- They forgot I was back there.
- No.

176
00:08:58,655 --> 00:09:00,322
It's all right.

177
00:09:00,424 --> 00:09:02,256
I'm not...

178
00:09:02,359 --> 00:09:05,293
I'm not too big on
talking to people.

179
00:09:05,395 --> 00:09:07,962
And nobody talks to
me much back there.

180
00:09:08,064 --> 00:09:11,566
They just, you know,
bring me the dishes.

181
00:09:13,603 --> 00:09:15,637
I lost my arm.

182
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,073
I don't wanna have one arm.

183
00:09:19,175 --> 00:09:20,842
I don't want to be a freak.

184
00:09:20,944 --> 00:09:23,645
I don't like people
staring at me.

185
00:09:23,747 --> 00:09:27,182
- We're gonna do
everything we can.
- Please.

186
00:09:27,284 --> 00:09:29,901
OK, Frankie, I'm gonna
take you up to surgery now.

187
00:09:30,003 --> 00:09:32,337
We're gonna try and
reattach the arm, OK?

188
00:09:32,439 --> 00:09:34,839
Do we have an open OR? I'll
prep him. Work on the stump.

189
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:38,976
You debride the arm, tag the vessels,
get it up to me as soon as you can.

190
00:09:42,131 --> 00:09:44,883
Wow. Trauma Room Barbie.

191
00:09:48,305 --> 00:09:50,705
Irrigation here and
suction, please?

192
00:09:50,807 --> 00:09:53,608
So Grandinetti's is gone.

193
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:55,643
A Seattle institution.

194
00:09:55,745 --> 00:09:58,513
- Dr. Warren,
you ever been there?
- Couple times. Good scampi.

195
00:09:58,615 --> 00:10:02,566
Yeah, place is so romantic.
Perfectly lit, intimate.

196
00:10:02,669 --> 00:10:04,669
Those cozy little
booths in back.

197
00:10:04,754 --> 00:10:06,615
Three-oh silk tie, please.

198
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:09,890
A little too intense
for a first date, though.

199
00:10:09,992 --> 00:10:11,654
Bailey, where would
you go on a first date?

200
00:10:11,678 --> 00:10:13,405
Isn't there a dying
child somewhere?

201
00:10:13,429 --> 00:10:14,929
Nope. I had some time.

202
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:16,531
And I wanted to observe one...

203
00:10:16,632 --> 00:10:19,300
one of these.

204
00:10:19,402 --> 00:10:22,003
Aw!

205
00:10:22,105 --> 00:10:24,539
- Baby looks perfect.
- Awesome.

206
00:10:24,641 --> 00:10:28,609
- Um, can I, like,
get that in writing?
- Oh.

207
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:30,345
Even better.

208
00:10:30,447 --> 00:10:34,049
- Here is a souvenir.
- Oh... Um...

209
00:10:34,151 --> 00:10:37,851
Don't you have some
kind of official form or...

210
00:10:37,954 --> 00:10:40,321
a hospital document
you can give me?

211
00:10:40,423 --> 00:10:41,584
Why do you need
an official form?

212
00:10:41,608 --> 00:10:44,943
Well, it's none
of your business.

213
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:47,328
If you want your
official form, it is, Sloan.

214
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:49,981
What's going on?

215
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:51,911
It's for the adoption
attorney, OK?

216
00:10:51,935 --> 00:10:55,252
They need, like, a clean bill of
health from me or something.

217
00:10:55,354 --> 00:10:58,023
There's this great
couple in San Francisco.

218
00:10:58,125 --> 00:11:01,826
- And they have
these two big dogs.
- An adoption attorney?

219
00:11:01,928 --> 00:11:04,763
Yeah, I'm not ready to be a mom.

220
00:11:04,865 --> 00:11:06,864
I'm just not ready yet.

221
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:10,218
- Have you told Mark?
- No.

222
00:11:10,319 --> 00:11:12,870
And you're my doctor, right?

223
00:11:12,972 --> 00:11:15,834
I mean, don't you guys have some kind
of rule that says you can't say anything?

224
00:11:15,858 --> 00:11:18,009
I'm not gonna tell him.

225
00:11:18,111 --> 00:11:19,391
And neither are you.

226
00:11:25,918 --> 00:11:28,486
Do you think she
needs an extra blanket?

227
00:11:28,588 --> 00:11:30,321
She gets chilled easily.

228
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:32,724
She must be one
hell of a tipper.

229
00:11:32,826 --> 00:11:35,159
- Sorry?
- I see why she
comes in every week.

230
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:37,962
I bet you take better care
of her than her own husband.

231
00:11:43,753 --> 00:11:45,636
When she first
started coming in,

232
00:11:45,739 --> 00:11:48,289
before they met,
we had a little game.

233
00:11:48,391 --> 00:11:51,876
She would try
anything we served.

234
00:11:51,978 --> 00:11:55,813
She was adventurous. Fearless.

235
00:11:55,915 --> 00:11:59,234
When she'd gone through the
menu, I would challenge the chefs

236
00:11:59,336 --> 00:12:01,702
to come up with something new.

237
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:04,738
It became, she became,

238
00:12:04,841 --> 00:12:06,941
my favorite part of the week.

239
00:12:08,078 --> 00:12:10,728
Then one night,
she came in with him.

240
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:14,616
She felt like this was a
safe place for a first date.

241
00:12:18,921 --> 00:12:20,754
That ring on her finger...

242
00:12:22,392 --> 00:12:24,225
The night he proposed to her,

243
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:28,329
I placed it in the creme
brulee for her to find.

244
00:12:28,431 --> 00:12:31,649
I watched her say yes
from the kitchen window.

245
00:12:35,438 --> 00:12:37,772
And they never
stopped coming in.

246
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:41,375
But now he orders for her,

247
00:12:41,477 --> 00:12:45,013
same thing every time.

248
00:12:45,115 --> 00:12:48,599
For 15 years, I've watched
their conversations grow shorter

249
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:50,467
and shorter.

250
00:12:50,569 --> 00:12:53,337
Until now, all they do is eat.

251
00:12:56,042 --> 00:12:58,009
She has no children.

252
00:13:00,146 --> 00:13:02,280
If he dies,

253
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:04,182
she'll be...

254
00:13:06,686 --> 00:13:08,102
She'll be all alone.

255
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:13,090
She's so afraid, I can see.

256
00:13:13,193 --> 00:13:16,393
And all I want to do is take
her hand in mine and tell her

257
00:13:16,495 --> 00:13:18,495
she'll be all right.

258
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:22,116
She'll never have to be alone,

259
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:24,785
if she doesn't want to be.

260
00:13:31,711 --> 00:13:35,296
You'll let me know when you have
good news about Mr. Banks, yes?

261
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:38,549
Yeah, right. Of course.

262
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,352
You can't leave
without telling him.

263
00:14:03,376 --> 00:14:04,925
Yes, I can. I can do whatever...

264
00:14:05,027 --> 00:14:06,827
- Sloan!
- Crap.

265
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:10,548
When did you get here? I
thought you were gonna call first.

266
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:12,900
Look!

267
00:14:13,002 --> 00:14:15,586
Oh, my God. Would
you look at that?

268
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:20,525
That's the Sloan
nose. Can you see it?

269
00:14:20,626 --> 00:14:22,510
Can you see it?

270
00:14:24,481 --> 00:14:26,931
It's my dad's. He
has my dad's nose.

271
00:14:27,834 --> 00:14:29,968
That's the Sloan nose.

272
00:14:31,988 --> 00:14:35,006
Damn it. Will you wait for
me? I wanna take you home.

273
00:14:35,107 --> 00:14:37,925
I got a surprise for you.
Could I see this again?

274
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:41,879
The Sloan nose.

275
00:14:48,487 --> 00:14:52,373
You win. He's been staring at
her from his kitchen for 15 years.

276
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:54,341
- He's not gonna tell her now.
- He just did.

277
00:14:54,443 --> 00:14:57,845
She was awake the whole time. She
heard everything. She has to say something.

278
00:14:57,947 --> 00:14:59,881
She's not. Her
husband's in surgery.

279
00:14:59,983 --> 00:15:01,849
So? They're clearly miserable.

280
00:15:01,951 --> 00:15:03,817
Did you hear the whole
creme brulee thing?

281
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:07,521
Fifty bucks says she tells
him she loves him, too.

282
00:15:07,623 --> 00:15:09,424
- You're on.
- Hi.

283
00:15:09,526 --> 00:15:12,476
- I've got your keys.
- What?

284
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:14,573
Dr. Shepherd told me you might
not make it home before the breakfast,

285
00:15:14,597 --> 00:15:17,509
so I should ask you what you need
from your closet and I'll grab it for you.

286
00:15:17,533 --> 00:15:21,035
You are not going in my closet.
Aren't you supposed to be a surgeon?

287
00:15:21,137 --> 00:15:23,404
He really needs you by
his side at that breakfast.

288
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:27,908
I am a surgeon. You tell the
chief that I will be in surgery.

289
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,329
So I'll just pick
something out for you.

290
00:15:34,734 --> 00:15:37,351
So Yang's with Hunt.

291
00:15:37,453 --> 00:15:40,237
Grey's with Shepherd.
Torres is with Robbins.

292
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:43,090
And you were with Sloan,
until he dumped you.

293
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:45,512
It's a wonder you
guys got any work done.

294
00:15:45,594 --> 00:15:47,461
He didn't dump me.

295
00:15:47,563 --> 00:15:49,063
He forgot about me.

296
00:15:49,165 --> 00:15:51,832
He decided that we were
going to start a family,

297
00:15:51,934 --> 00:15:54,135
and didn't ask me.

298
00:15:54,237 --> 00:15:56,603
He forgot I was even there.

299
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:59,574
He just left me lying
in dirty dishwater.

300
00:16:01,177 --> 00:16:02,810
What?

301
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,346
Nothing.

302
00:16:09,202 --> 00:16:11,085
I'm pretty.

303
00:16:11,187 --> 00:16:15,089
- What?
- In my family. I'm the pretty one.

304
00:16:15,191 --> 00:16:18,092
You know, um, my eyes and...

305
00:16:18,194 --> 00:16:19,893
my smile and my body.

306
00:16:19,995 --> 00:16:23,174
You should see me without a
shirt on. It's kind of ridiculous.

307
00:16:23,198 --> 00:16:26,834
But my family is smart, driven,

308
00:16:26,936 --> 00:16:28,770
crazy overachievers.

309
00:16:28,872 --> 00:16:31,851
And they look like they're
smart. They don't look like me.

310
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:35,208
Which has its perks,
except that my family

311
00:16:35,311 --> 00:16:37,377
treated me like I'm pretty.

312
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:40,247
They expected nothing from me.

313
00:16:40,349 --> 00:16:43,684
Ever. They never pushed
me. Never thought to.

314
00:16:43,787 --> 00:16:46,821
So I had to push myself. Hard.

315
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:50,925
I didn't even tell them I was taking
the MCATs till after I'd aced them.

316
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:57,364
My point is that you
can't just change your hair.

317
00:16:57,467 --> 00:17:00,651
You want to be unforgettable,
you want to not be mousy?

318
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:02,748
You can't just change your hair.

319
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:05,440
You have to actually change.

320
00:17:07,894 --> 00:17:09,460
Just saying.

321
00:17:12,849 --> 00:17:16,534
OK. I'm removing the glass

322
00:17:16,636 --> 00:17:19,921
very slowly...

323
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:22,640
OK, take this. Bovie.

324
00:17:22,742 --> 00:17:24,876
Nice work, Dr. Bailey.

325
00:17:24,977 --> 00:17:27,261
Dr. Warren, can
you believe Dr. Bailey

326
00:17:27,363 --> 00:17:30,431
almost left general surgery for
Peds surgery? Did you know that?

327
00:17:30,533 --> 00:17:34,034
- I did not.
- She almost said no

328
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:36,504
to general surgery. But
then she thought about it,

329
00:17:36,606 --> 00:17:39,840
and she changed her mind.

330
00:17:39,942 --> 00:17:42,009
She wasn't afraid to
rethink her decision.

331
00:17:42,111 --> 00:17:44,978
She just needed
to be asked again.

332
00:17:46,032 --> 00:17:49,133
I see. Clearly.

333
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:58,843
- You have my report thing?
- No.

334
00:17:58,945 --> 00:18:01,178
He took you in.

335
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,614
He's given you money,
he flew you to LA.

336
00:18:03,716 --> 00:18:06,700
He deserves to know. So if
you're not gonna tell him, I will.

337
00:18:06,802 --> 00:18:08,636
You paged me?

338
00:18:08,737 --> 00:18:10,349
- What's going on?
- You paged him?

339
00:18:10,373 --> 00:18:14,842
What's the matter?

340
00:18:14,944 --> 00:18:18,612
- Mark, she's...
- I'm giving the
baby up for adoption.

341
00:18:19,615 --> 00:18:22,133
I'm not a mom. I'm not ready.

342
00:18:22,235 --> 00:18:26,036
And I want him to have good
parents and a good home.

343
00:18:26,139 --> 00:18:28,372
No, don't. Don't do this.
Don't give this baby away.

344
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:32,426
They'll love him. They'll
love him more than I will.

345
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:35,245
Give him to me.

346
00:18:35,348 --> 00:18:37,515
I'll take him.

347
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:38,732
I'll adopt him.

348
00:18:40,386 --> 00:18:43,621
I understand. I understand
you're not ready, but I am.

349
00:18:43,723 --> 00:18:47,107
And I know I don't have
the best track record.

350
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:50,044
And I should have been
there for you, and I wasn't.

351
00:18:50,146 --> 00:18:53,280
But I will be there
for this baby. Please.

352
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:56,016
I want him to
have a family and...

353
00:18:56,118 --> 00:18:58,719
You've been really nice to
me the past couple of months,

354
00:18:58,821 --> 00:19:01,388
but you're not a
family. You're just a guy.

355
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:03,390
- Sloan, please.
- I'll help.

356
00:19:05,661 --> 00:19:08,296
Uh...

357
00:19:08,398 --> 00:19:10,331
I'm right across the hall.

358
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,134
And we're a family, sort of.

359
00:19:13,236 --> 00:19:15,436
And we're doctors.

360
00:19:15,538 --> 00:19:17,271
And we're best friends.

361
00:19:17,373 --> 00:19:20,240
And... And we're good people.

362
00:19:24,364 --> 00:19:27,347
We'll... We'll take
care of the baby.

363
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:28,699
Together.

364
00:19:30,736 --> 00:19:32,720
We'll love him.

365
00:19:33,406 --> 00:19:34,621
Really will.

366
00:19:36,476 --> 00:19:37,725
Just think about it.

367
00:19:37,827 --> 00:19:40,594
Go home, we'll talk about it.

368
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:43,698
Can we talk about it?

369
00:19:46,869 --> 00:19:49,220
Yes. Yes, we can.

370
00:19:49,322 --> 00:19:51,321
We can talk about it.

371
00:20:06,589 --> 00:20:08,867
- Thank God. Where'd you get those?
- Patient room.

372
00:20:08,891 --> 00:20:11,620
Guy's in a coma, he's not gonna
miss them. Anything happen?

373
00:20:11,644 --> 00:20:16,063
He's still asleep. She
wants to say something.

374
00:20:16,165 --> 00:20:18,226
Oh! Oh, my God, I'm starving!

375
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:21,719
- Ooh. These are all half-eaten.
- So you can see what they are.

376
00:20:24,707 --> 00:20:25,867
What are we doing?

377
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,686
Her boring husband's in surgery.

378
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:28,938
This dude's been in
love with her for 15 years.

379
00:20:28,962 --> 00:20:30,394
She just found out.

380
00:20:30,496 --> 00:20:32,229
We're waiting to see
if she says something.

381
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:34,548
- Or if her husband croaks.
- It's OK if he does

382
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:38,285
because they're miserable. I mean,
is this what marriage turns into?

383
00:20:38,388 --> 00:20:40,905
Running out of things to say
and changing who you are?

384
00:20:41,007 --> 00:20:42,856
- Probably.
- Yeah.

385
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:46,677
Well, I didn't marry Derek to be
the chief's arm candy. I'm a surgeon.

386
00:20:46,779 --> 00:20:48,891
Yeah, you married him
for the great surgeries.

387
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:50,125
I didn't do that either.

388
00:20:50,149 --> 00:20:51,343
- Right.
- You should have.

389
00:20:51,367 --> 00:20:52,849
Shh! She's gonna say something.

390
00:20:52,951 --> 00:20:55,086
She's gonna wake him up.

391
00:20:55,188 --> 00:20:57,938
Oh! What's she saying?

392
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:15,806
She can't breathe!
Get a crash cart!

393
00:21:21,648 --> 00:21:23,626
She's got a big air
leak in her chest tube.

394
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:26,016
- What's happening?
- Keep her on 100 percent O2.

395
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:29,853
Get a bronchoscopy. Grey, see
if an OR's available just in case.

396
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:34,191
She's having trouble breathing. We'll
let you know more as soon as we do.

397
00:21:35,611 --> 00:21:37,828
We saved the arm. We
saved it. We're ready.

398
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:40,525
- It's gonna have to be an amputation.
- - What?

399
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:43,400
There's too much devascularized
tissue, too much contamination.

400
00:21:43,502 --> 00:21:47,204
We could push antibiotics and let
the stump heal, but by that time...

401
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:50,323
The arm will be dead.
Page me when he's awake.

402
00:21:50,425 --> 00:21:51,425
I'll tell him.

403
00:21:51,527 --> 00:21:52,807
They...

404
00:21:52,862 --> 00:21:54,806
They can't just leave it behind.

405
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:57,831
We could move it somewhere
else. Attach it to a healthy zone.

406
00:21:57,933 --> 00:22:02,920
- Don't tell me, mouse.
- I'm just saying they could...

407
00:22:03,856 --> 00:22:06,356
Temporary ectopic replantation!

408
00:22:08,043 --> 00:22:11,245
You have to keep the arm
alive until the stump heals.

409
00:22:11,347 --> 00:22:13,914
Yes, but in cases
involving the elbow...

410
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:16,350
It's extreme. He'll lose
range of motion, grip failure.

411
00:22:16,452 --> 00:22:19,903
He'll keep his arm! He
deserves extreme measures!

412
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:23,124
If the arm is still viable,
you can't just let it die.

413
00:22:24,177 --> 00:22:25,621
Has it ever been done
before, above the elbow?

414
00:22:25,645 --> 00:22:27,656
I don't know. It could be done.

415
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:31,131
You could implant it onto the
epigastric and the venae commitante.

416
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:34,117
Give you a few days
for the stump to heal.

417
00:22:34,219 --> 00:22:36,186
- I've never done one.
- Neither have I.

418
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:40,707
So? After today, you
can't say that anymore.

419
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:44,044
Come on! I told him that we
would do everything we could,

420
00:22:44,146 --> 00:22:46,496
do everything that we can!

421
00:22:49,719 --> 00:22:52,653
I'll call Shepherd and let
him know. Grey, Avery,

422
00:22:52,755 --> 00:22:55,305
get ready to scrub in.
We're gonna be a while.

423
00:23:00,929 --> 00:23:02,363
OK, that?

424
00:23:02,465 --> 00:23:04,098
Not mousy.

425
00:23:07,003 --> 00:23:09,102
You're going into surgery now?

426
00:23:09,205 --> 00:23:11,939
- There's this breakfast.
- I know. I know about the breakfast.

427
00:23:12,041 --> 00:23:14,019
Because there's some
resident I don't know

428
00:23:14,043 --> 00:23:17,778
- rooting through
my closet right now.
- Sorry. She's over-eager.

429
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:20,208
I have surgery. I can't
really give up the surgery.

430
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:23,216
- No, I wouldn't want you to.
- Just to smile

431
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:27,404
and stand at a podium
for the suits? It's...

432
00:23:28,808 --> 00:23:30,958
No, you shouldn't come.

433
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:35,129
You know, my patient,
she's somebody's wife, too.

434
00:23:35,231 --> 00:23:37,597
And I'm her doctor, and...

435
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:44,972
- OK?
- OK.

436
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:49,376
OK.

437
00:24:01,673 --> 00:24:03,440
- Hey.
- Hey.

438
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:07,111
I got a tracheobronchial tear.

439
00:24:07,213 --> 00:24:09,679
Transitory ectopic implantation.

440
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:11,765
Wow. Nice.

441
00:24:19,975 --> 00:24:23,193
I rented a house. It's amazing.

442
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:25,913
It's right on the water, a little
cottage. And there are deer.

443
00:24:26,015 --> 00:24:29,983
Like Bambi deer and
singing birds, it's incredible.

444
00:24:35,691 --> 00:24:39,243
I found this little secret coffee
place down the street from here.

445
00:24:39,345 --> 00:24:43,180
And, uh, oh, I was
thinking of getting a puppy.

446
00:24:45,685 --> 00:24:48,051
But, you know, you have
to be home with a puppy

447
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:51,071
and I'm always here. So
I went down to the pound,

448
00:24:51,173 --> 00:24:53,941
'cause I... I wanted to
get it out of my system.

449
00:24:54,043 --> 00:24:56,277
You know, the puppy love.

450
00:24:56,379 --> 00:25:00,915
And I held all of these
incredibly sweet dogs,

451
00:25:01,017 --> 00:25:04,618
and you would
have been really...

452
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,704
really proud of me, Owen.
I didn't take one home.

453
00:25:09,542 --> 00:25:11,608
I went out and
got a fish instead.

454
00:25:11,711 --> 00:25:15,912
Let me see. What else? Oh, I got
a bikini wax. Yeah, an actual wax.

455
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:19,716
I haven't had one those since,
remember I tried to wax myself...

456
00:25:19,818 --> 00:25:22,786
- What is your point?!
- You were my best friend!

457
00:25:27,893 --> 00:25:31,711
My best friend who I
could tell everything to.

458
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:35,799
And now you won't
even look at me.

459
00:25:35,902 --> 00:25:37,902
'Cause you said you loved me.

460
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,774
You said you loved
me, too. And then...

461
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:47,394
- And then you chose Yang.
- You chose her, too.

462
00:25:47,496 --> 00:25:48,879
You chose her, too.

463
00:25:53,286 --> 00:25:55,486
I feel like I'm cheating on her.

464
00:25:57,539 --> 00:26:01,059
When I talk to you, I feel like
I'm cheating on her. So I'm sorry.

465
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:10,583
I miss my best friend, too.

466
00:26:31,457 --> 00:26:33,290
Don't you have
something else to do?

467
00:26:33,392 --> 00:26:36,871
This is the closest I've been to
the inside of an OR in a week.

468
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:40,075
Last week, I would have
been paged in to help.

469
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:43,567
Now, I'm paged about
fundraising brunches.

470
00:26:47,756 --> 00:26:49,340
I'm adopting Sloan's baby.

471
00:26:50,659 --> 00:26:52,242
It's the right thing to do.

472
00:26:52,344 --> 00:26:54,812
- I think I can.
- Mm-hmm.

473
00:26:54,914 --> 00:26:57,830
I certainly want to.
Callie said she'd help.

474
00:27:02,838 --> 00:27:06,306
- I'm having a baby.
- Congratulations.

475
00:27:06,409 --> 00:27:09,860
- I'm happy for you.
- I'm happy for you, too, chief.

476
00:27:10,863 --> 00:27:13,029
It's what you always
wanted, right?

477
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:14,564
Yep.

478
00:27:14,666 --> 00:27:16,934
It's what I've always wanted.

479
00:27:18,437 --> 00:27:21,204
How is he, Dr. Bailey? It
looks like you're nearly done.

480
00:27:21,307 --> 00:27:23,740
And it's just in
time for dinner.

481
00:27:23,842 --> 00:27:25,992
And maybe even some dancing.

482
00:27:26,095 --> 00:27:28,489
- If the patient looks good...
- He'll be just fine.

483
00:27:28,513 --> 00:27:31,448
He won't be dancing
anytime soon,

484
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:33,633
but when the time comes

485
00:27:33,736 --> 00:27:36,336
and he wants to go out dancing,

486
00:27:36,438 --> 00:27:41,141
he will be perfectly capable of
making that determination himself,

487
00:27:41,243 --> 00:27:44,344
without any help from anyone.

488
00:27:44,447 --> 00:27:46,441
And I don't need any help here,

489
00:27:46,465 --> 00:27:51,017
so if you are through
helping me, you can go.

490
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:53,253
- I just...
- Now.

491
00:27:57,142 --> 00:27:59,175
- She's nice. Chatty.
- Stop talking.

492
00:27:59,261 --> 00:28:02,329
To be fair, I never said a
word about dancing, although...

493
00:28:02,431 --> 00:28:06,532
Shh! What is all this bleeding?

494
00:28:07,903 --> 00:28:10,470
Ah! Splenic artery's torn.

495
00:28:10,589 --> 00:28:12,906
He's gonna lose this spleen.

496
00:28:13,008 --> 00:28:14,474
Lap pads!

497
00:28:15,728 --> 00:28:17,127
Where's my patient?

498
00:28:17,229 --> 00:28:19,629
No idea. He must have left.

499
00:28:38,984 --> 00:28:40,434
I need help in here!

500
00:28:45,791 --> 00:28:47,569
There you are. I've got your
wife's clothes for the breakfast

501
00:28:47,593 --> 00:28:49,971
and I made note cards for
your speech for this morning.

502
00:28:49,995 --> 00:28:51,795
- Good. Go home.
- If you're here, I'm here.

503
00:28:51,847 --> 00:28:53,346
Honestly, I'm happy
to help with this.

504
00:28:53,448 --> 00:28:54,993
You wanna be an
executive assistant?

505
00:28:55,017 --> 00:28:57,717
You should want to do
surgery. That's all I want to do.

506
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:59,736
I'm not sure I can.

507
00:29:01,006 --> 00:29:04,491
I... Look, I'm grateful
that you hired me back.

508
00:29:04,593 --> 00:29:07,294
It's just been easier to
help out with this stuff.

509
00:29:07,396 --> 00:29:10,848
It's easier coming back as that,
rather than coming back as the doctor

510
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:15,452
who made a mistake and killed
someone. Killed someone's mom.

511
00:29:15,554 --> 00:29:18,622
And I'm not sure I can be that person.
So if you're not sure you need me,

512
00:29:18,724 --> 00:29:20,174
then maybe I shouldn't be here.

513
00:29:20,276 --> 00:29:22,759
Dr. Shepherd? I have a
patient with an epidural bleed.

514
00:29:26,398 --> 00:29:27,964
Come with me.

515
00:29:36,341 --> 00:29:39,926
- You couldn't do it?
- Actually, we could. Um...

516
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:44,615
You need to prepare yourself. We needed
to take some extraordinary measures.

517
00:29:44,717 --> 00:29:48,785
Your arm needed a blood supply to
keep it alive until we could reattach it.

518
00:29:48,887 --> 00:29:51,738
So we had to relocate it

519
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:54,073
to where we could get one.

520
00:30:00,148 --> 00:30:01,781
Is that my arm?!

521
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:03,283
What did you do?

522
00:30:03,385 --> 00:30:05,352
Why would you do this to me?

523
00:30:05,454 --> 00:30:09,189
- What did you do to me?!
- It's only temporary.

524
00:30:09,291 --> 00:30:13,727
OK, just for a few days.
Frankie, this is what you wanted.

525
00:30:13,829 --> 00:30:16,847
- You wanted your arm.
- In the right place!

526
00:30:16,949 --> 00:30:21,684
I said I didn't want to be a freak!
You should have left me like I was!

527
00:30:28,477 --> 00:30:32,245
Oh, come on. Did you
even tell him you're leaving?

528
00:30:33,582 --> 00:30:36,516
Look, I just wanted
a place to stay.

529
00:30:36,618 --> 00:30:40,170
And some money. I didn't know
he was gonna care this much.

530
00:30:40,272 --> 00:30:42,172
He bought a crib.

531
00:30:42,708 --> 00:30:44,340
He's a good man.

532
00:30:44,442 --> 00:30:46,676
And he'll be very
good to your baby.

533
00:30:46,762 --> 00:30:49,657
You could know the baby, if Mark
raised him. You could come back and visit.

534
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:52,582
I don't want to know
where to come back to.

535
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:56,586
If I give him to you
guys, it's still my baby.

536
00:30:56,688 --> 00:31:00,257
And I need him to
be somebody else's.

537
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:04,811
I mean, my dad got a
clean break from me.

538
00:31:04,913 --> 00:31:07,380
And look at him now.

539
00:31:07,482 --> 00:31:09,416
Don't I deserve that?

540
00:31:18,911 --> 00:31:21,745
Prenatal vitamins are
not a joke. Take them.

541
00:31:21,847 --> 00:31:24,347
And do not skip any
doctor's appointments.

542
00:31:24,449 --> 00:31:28,935
And if you get into any trouble,

543
00:31:29,037 --> 00:31:32,572
or you have a
problem with anything...

544
00:31:34,476 --> 00:31:36,175
call us.

545
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:41,431
Just... take care of yourself.

546
00:31:42,951 --> 00:31:45,018
Thanks.

547
00:31:52,894 --> 00:31:56,329
- Mrs. Banks?
- How is my husband?

548
00:31:56,431 --> 00:31:59,716
There's been some complications,
but Dr. Bailey's working very hard.

549
00:31:59,818 --> 00:32:02,936
And I'll let you know
more as soon as I do.

550
00:32:04,106 --> 00:32:06,172
Is... Is Emile still here?

551
00:32:07,226 --> 00:32:09,059
Emile is in surgery.

552
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,372
There's been some
bleeding in his brain.

553
00:32:11,396 --> 00:32:13,129
Oh, my God.

554
00:32:15,467 --> 00:32:17,233
Oh, God.

555
00:32:20,222 --> 00:32:23,156
He never said a word.

556
00:32:23,258 --> 00:32:26,026
For 15 years.

557
00:32:27,462 --> 00:32:29,662
Did you know?

558
00:32:29,765 --> 00:32:32,315
Why do you think I
kept going back there?

559
00:32:32,417 --> 00:32:34,367
But then I met Bob,

560
00:32:34,469 --> 00:32:38,588
and Emile never...

561
00:32:40,826 --> 00:32:42,975
I made a choice.

562
00:32:43,078 --> 00:32:45,895
- But you kept going back.
- I did.

563
00:32:45,997 --> 00:32:49,032
Because Bob liked it.

564
00:32:49,134 --> 00:32:51,067
And I love Bob.

565
00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:53,970
It became our place.

566
00:32:56,274 --> 00:32:59,909
And, yes, he orders for me.

567
00:33:00,012 --> 00:33:02,846
Because he knows what I like.

568
00:33:02,948 --> 00:33:05,699
And it may seem like

569
00:33:05,801 --> 00:33:08,218
we have nothing
left to talk about,

570
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:11,955
but sometimes it's
nice not to have to talk.

571
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:18,828
Fifteen years ago,
I made a choice.

572
00:33:20,466 --> 00:33:23,367
And I keep making it every day.

573
00:33:25,187 --> 00:33:27,353
That's what marriage is.

574
00:33:30,475 --> 00:33:34,211
That's a lot of damage to his pancreas.
I can't get this bleeding under control.

575
00:33:34,313 --> 00:33:36,997
OK. More suction! More!

576
00:33:37,115 --> 00:33:40,133
The middle meningeal
artery's completely severed.

577
00:33:40,235 --> 00:33:43,586
What did I miss? I've been
literally watching this guy all night.

578
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:45,483
- How could I miss...?
- - You didn't miss anything.

579
00:33:45,507 --> 00:33:48,675
First CT was negative, there
were no neurological symptoms.

580
00:33:48,777 --> 00:33:51,361
The kind of bleed you never
know about until it's too late.

581
00:33:51,463 --> 00:33:54,464
- Is it too late?
- I don't know yet. Bipolars.

582
00:33:54,566 --> 00:33:58,568
- BP's 80 over 60, falling!
- - Push another atropine!

583
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:01,470
Damn it. Come on!

584
00:34:01,573 --> 00:34:04,057
Damn it, come on!
Stay with me! Come on!

585
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:06,209
Stay with me!

586
00:34:06,311 --> 00:34:07,760
Come on! Stay with me!

587
00:34:07,862 --> 00:34:09,830
Stay with me. Come on.

588
00:34:09,932 --> 00:34:11,597
Come on.

589
00:34:24,329 --> 00:34:27,797
The dude waited on tables and
watched his life happen without him.

590
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:30,433
He's probably better off.

591
00:34:33,672 --> 00:34:35,839
I can't... I can't do this.

592
00:34:35,941 --> 00:34:40,476
I can't just... I can't
just watch people die!

593
00:34:43,615 --> 00:34:46,135
I... I shouldn't have come back.

594
00:34:47,101 --> 00:34:49,268
Listen.

595
00:34:49,371 --> 00:34:51,654
I made a mistake last year.

596
00:34:54,576 --> 00:34:56,576
I almost walked away.

597
00:34:59,314 --> 00:35:01,581
If you don't feel the losses...

598
00:35:03,085 --> 00:35:06,152
if they don't hurt
you and humble you,

599
00:35:06,254 --> 00:35:09,789
that's when you know you're
not cut out for this kind of work.

600
00:35:13,578 --> 00:35:16,112
You can be a good
surgeon, Kepner.

601
00:35:17,015 --> 00:35:19,316
It's why I brought you back.

602
00:35:27,925 --> 00:35:30,226
Congratulations. I
thought we'd lost him,

603
00:35:30,328 --> 00:35:33,263
- but you managed to...
- I can't talk to you.

604
00:35:33,364 --> 00:35:36,382
Right. Um... Look, I'm sorry.

605
00:35:36,484 --> 00:35:39,602
- I thought you and I might...
- I can't talk to you.

606
00:35:39,705 --> 00:35:41,237
You make me nervous.

607
00:35:41,339 --> 00:35:44,941
I forget what I...

608
00:35:45,043 --> 00:35:49,312
And I say things I
don't want to say.

609
00:35:49,414 --> 00:35:51,097
And I can't...

610
00:35:51,199 --> 00:35:53,633
I just go stupid.

611
00:35:53,735 --> 00:35:57,403
I... I like you.
That's all. There.

612
00:35:58,706 --> 00:36:01,708
- All right.
- And so if you
want to go to dinner,

613
00:36:01,810 --> 00:36:04,861
fine. We'll show
up and try to talk.

614
00:36:04,963 --> 00:36:07,530
- How's tomorrow night?
- Fine. I might have surgery.

615
00:36:07,632 --> 00:36:10,399
I might join you.

616
00:36:21,462 --> 00:36:24,363
You can tell your patient
her husband's gonna be OK.

617
00:36:24,465 --> 00:36:27,199
- What about Emile?
- Shepherd said there was no way

618
00:36:27,301 --> 00:36:30,370
to know it was detectable
until it was too late. Here.

619
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:36,309
- I think this means you win.
- I know. I don't want it.

620
00:36:36,411 --> 00:36:39,312
I don't want it either. You
would have won anyway.

621
00:36:39,414 --> 00:36:42,148
- You think?
- Of course.

622
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:46,152
- That's her husband.
- Grey, you ready to scrub in?

623
00:36:46,254 --> 00:36:48,104
I have a valve replacement.

624
00:36:48,189 --> 00:36:50,223
You know, I...

625
00:36:53,895 --> 00:36:55,879
Yang is still here.
Can she do it?

626
00:36:57,933 --> 00:37:00,850
<i>We have to keep
reinventing ourselves,</i>

627
00:37:00,952 --> 00:37:03,870
<i>almost every minute.</i>

628
00:37:03,972 --> 00:37:07,206
<i>Because the world can
change in an instant.</i>

629
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:09,976
Hello, Mrs. Banks.

630
00:37:10,078 --> 00:37:12,078
How's Emile doing?

631
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:14,730
I'm sorry.

632
00:37:14,832 --> 00:37:18,734
We did everything we could, but the
bleeding in his brain was too severe.

633
00:37:20,155 --> 00:37:22,088
I'm very sorry.

634
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:25,825
Thank you.

635
00:37:44,779 --> 00:37:48,081
<i>And there's no time
for looking back.</i>

636
00:37:59,393 --> 00:38:01,961
All those people out there.

637
00:38:02,063 --> 00:38:04,697
They just want to stare at me.

638
00:38:04,799 --> 00:38:06,265
They do.

639
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:09,618
The doctors want to see you,
they want to ask you questions.

640
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:12,138
Because you're very rare.

641
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,973
And special.

642
00:38:14,075 --> 00:38:16,125
There might be press.

643
00:38:16,227 --> 00:38:19,178
And there's a personal injury
lawyer floating around somewhere

644
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:22,899
that thinks that restaurant
might owe you a lot of money.

645
00:38:25,387 --> 00:38:26,387
How much money?

646
00:38:26,438 --> 00:38:29,122
Sometimes, change
is good, right?

647
00:38:38,533 --> 00:38:40,549
I don't believe you.

648
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:42,618
You don't have to do that.

649
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,321
I wanted to before you got home.

650
00:38:44,423 --> 00:38:47,240
And you don't have to
do what you offered to do.

651
00:38:47,342 --> 00:38:49,087
I'm not gonna hold you to that.

652
00:38:49,111 --> 00:38:52,812
- Mark...
- But thank you
so much for offering.

653
00:38:53,615 --> 00:38:56,732
And, uh...

654
00:38:56,818 --> 00:38:59,018
it could be kind
of great, right?

655
00:39:00,688 --> 00:39:03,890
<i>Sometimes, the
changes are forced on us.</i>

656
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:12,129
What are you doing?

657
00:39:15,136 --> 00:39:16,936
Sit down.

658
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:35,020
<i>Sometimes, they
happen by accident.</i>

659
00:39:38,409 --> 00:39:40,893
Oh, get used to
it. I'm keeping it.

660
00:39:40,995 --> 00:39:43,562
You should. You're moving on.

661
00:39:43,665 --> 00:39:45,832
I didn't mean that
was a bad thing.

662
00:39:45,934 --> 00:39:47,700
It's what you should do.

663
00:39:48,787 --> 00:39:51,871
- I hate Valentine's Day.
- Me, too.

664
00:39:56,578 --> 00:39:58,728
<i>And we make the most of them.</i>

665
00:40:11,592 --> 00:40:13,943
Hey, Owen. Hey.

666
00:40:14,045 --> 00:40:16,695
- Hi. Do you have a minute?
- I'll wait in the car.

667
00:40:16,797 --> 00:40:19,399
No, stay. It's fine if you stay.

668
00:40:21,536 --> 00:40:23,714
I said that I love
you and it's out there

669
00:40:23,738 --> 00:40:25,883
and I know that I
can't un-ring the bell,

670
00:40:25,907 --> 00:40:27,957
but I'm un-ringing
the bell. I take it back.

671
00:40:28,059 --> 00:40:30,526
- I'm gonna go...
- No, stay.

672
00:40:30,628 --> 00:40:33,612
I miss my friend, Owen.
More than anything,

673
00:40:33,715 --> 00:40:36,098
I miss my friend.

674
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:39,736
The rest I can deal with.
I can deal with it. It's...

675
00:40:39,838 --> 00:40:42,038
I have a job that I love,

676
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:45,508
and an amazing student to teach,

677
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:47,655
and I've got a
cottage with deer,

678
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:50,346
and a fish and various
waxed body parts.

679
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:52,615
I'm gonna be fine!

680
00:40:55,186 --> 00:40:58,170
You and I are gonna be friends.

681
00:40:58,273 --> 00:41:01,407
And you're doing a valve
replacement with me in ten.

682
00:41:02,827 --> 00:41:05,912
- Really?
- Go prep 2219.

683
00:41:08,165 --> 00:41:09,799
OK.

684
00:41:10,518 --> 00:41:12,351
I'll see you at home.

685
00:41:12,453 --> 00:41:17,006
<i>We have to constantly come
up with new ways to fix ourselves.</i>

686
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:21,144
You can't un-ring the bell.

687
00:41:23,064 --> 00:41:24,630
I know.

688
00:41:25,934 --> 00:41:28,414
But I am gonna try like hell.

689
00:41:29,688 --> 00:41:31,253
<i>So we change.</i>

690
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:34,490
<i>We adapt.</i>

691
00:41:36,661 --> 00:41:39,329
Congratulations.

692
00:41:39,431 --> 00:41:41,809
- Good to see you, chief.
- Good to see you, too.

693
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:43,833
- Hey!
- Hi.

694
00:41:43,935 --> 00:41:46,752
- You didn't have to come.
- I know I didn't. I chose to.

695
00:41:48,956 --> 00:41:51,173
- Shall we go in?
- Yes.

696
00:41:54,562 --> 00:41:56,946
<i>We create new
versions of ourselves.</i>

697
00:41:57,048 --> 00:41:59,582
- Mrs. Shepherd?!
- I know.

698
00:41:59,684 --> 00:42:02,134
- Mrs. Shepherd?
- I know.

699
00:42:02,236 --> 00:42:05,121
I don't do brunches. I
don't miss surgeries.

700
00:42:05,223 --> 00:42:06,463
And I don't do Valentine's Day.

701
00:42:06,507 --> 00:42:08,524
<i>We just need to be sure</i>

702
00:42:08,626 --> 00:42:11,511
<i>that this one is an
improvement over the last.</i>

703
00:42:11,613 --> 00:42:14,681
You're gonna have to make
this up to me with a lot of sex.

704
00:42:14,783 --> 00:42:17,633
Yes, dear.
