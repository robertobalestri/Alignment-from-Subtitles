1
00:00:02,303 --> 00:00:05,337
<i>In order to get a
good diagnosis...</i>

2
00:00:10,861 --> 00:00:14,663
<i>doctors have to constantly
change their perspective.</i>

3
00:00:18,569 --> 00:00:21,737
<i>We start by getting the
patient's point of view...</i>

4
00:00:24,007 --> 00:00:27,776
<i>though they often don't
have a clue what's going on.</i>

5
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:34,366
<i>So we look at the patient
from every possible angle.</i>

6
00:00:34,468 --> 00:00:39,838
<i>We rule things out, we
uncover new information,</i>

7
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:42,457
<i>trying to get to
what's actually wrong.</i>

8
00:00:46,262 --> 00:00:48,930
<i>We're asked for second opinions,</i>

9
00:00:49,032 --> 00:00:53,084
<i>hoping we'll see something
others might have missed.</i>

10
00:00:57,357 --> 00:01:01,226
<i>For the patient, a fresh
perspective can mean</i>

11
00:01:01,328 --> 00:01:04,029
<i>the difference between
living and dying.</i>

12
00:01:05,098 --> 00:01:07,866
<i>For the doctor, it can
mean picking a fight</i>

13
00:01:07,968 --> 00:01:09,968
<i>with everyone who
got there before you.</i>

14
00:01:10,053 --> 00:01:12,704
- Someone's getting fired.
- Stop it.

15
00:01:12,807 --> 00:01:14,989
- She wasn't even my patient.
- What?

16
00:01:15,109 --> 00:01:18,443
- Nothing.
- How long is this gonna take?

17
00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:20,690
Why? You need to
make a phone call?

18
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:27,885
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

19
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:33,214
- That's enough!
- Are you kidding me?

20
00:01:33,293 --> 00:01:35,060
I said enough!

21
00:01:36,947 --> 00:01:38,613
What happened here tonight,

22
00:01:38,716 --> 00:01:42,518
what happened to that
patient was inexcusable!

23
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:46,054
We're gonna be here until I
find out who is responsible for it.

24
00:01:46,156 --> 00:01:47,436
So, until then, you'll sit down,

25
00:01:47,474 --> 00:01:49,591
you'll shut up and
you'll wait to be called.

26
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:57,449
Hunt.

27
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:03,271
- I'm not going down for this.
- Someone is.

28
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:19,487
Dr. Hunt, you know Larry
Jennings from our board.

29
00:02:19,589 --> 00:02:22,591
- This is our in-house counsel.
- We're trying to
get in front...

30
00:02:22,693 --> 00:02:25,660
Uh, I need you to give me the
lay of the land of your ER tonight.

31
00:02:25,762 --> 00:02:28,722
- From the beginning.
- We were slammed
with a mass casualty,

32
00:02:28,782 --> 00:02:31,149
a hotel fire. A
half-dozen burn victims,

33
00:02:31,235 --> 00:02:32,551
a penetrating chest wound,

34
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:34,736
a firefighter with
multiple traumas.

35
00:02:34,838 --> 00:02:36,438
What doctors were working?

36
00:02:36,557 --> 00:02:38,773
Yang, Grey, Karev, Adamson,

37
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:43,261
that big kid whose name I don't
know, Kepner, Avery and Torres.

38
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:46,280
Who was on the patient in
question, the one who died?

39
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:49,884
Everyone. Everyone
was everywhere.

40
00:02:49,987 --> 00:02:53,121
All right, who
got the chart first?

41
00:02:55,659 --> 00:02:57,192
Dr. Yang.

42
00:02:57,294 --> 00:03:00,645
It wasn't my patient. I
had it for two seconds,

43
00:03:00,747 --> 00:03:02,192
and then I was called outside.

44
00:03:02,216 --> 00:03:07,985
- Start from the beginning.
- I was paged to the ER.

45
00:03:08,088 --> 00:03:12,824
I'm putting myself in a
timeout before I kill someone.

46
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:15,410
Seen Bailey? She was supposed
to sign my discharge papers

47
00:03:15,512 --> 00:03:18,146
- after her appy.
- Oh, good. Go home, get better

48
00:03:18,248 --> 00:03:19,826
and come back.
'Cause I need you.

49
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:22,316
- Are the Mercy West people bad?
- They're everywhere.

50
00:03:22,418 --> 00:03:25,120
There are more of them than
us, and they're kicking our asses.

51
00:03:25,222 --> 00:03:29,007
I miss Izzie. We need
more us's, so get back here!

52
00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:31,826
I have to be discharged.
Wanna forge Bailey's signature?

53
00:03:31,928 --> 00:03:33,361
No, that will get me fired.

54
00:03:33,464 --> 00:03:35,581
Ooh! Ask one of
the new ones to do it.

55
00:03:35,683 --> 00:03:38,416
Get them fired.

56
00:03:39,453 --> 00:03:43,654
- Timeout's over.
- Well, send Bailey!

57
00:03:43,757 --> 00:03:46,191
Try to keep the burn unit
and trauma rooms clear!

58
00:03:46,293 --> 00:03:48,860
Call Respiratory. We
need ventilators on standby!

59
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:52,964
We got a burn victim and
her kid. Take your pick. Hey...

60
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:55,166
- Yang, come with me.
- Oh, we can help!

61
00:03:55,269 --> 00:03:57,080
Oh, great. Here, take these.

62
00:03:57,104 --> 00:03:59,938
- I handed it off.
- To who? Who did you
hand it to?

63
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:12,584
I have no idea.

64
00:04:12,686 --> 00:04:14,836
- I got her chart.
- Yang, come with me.

65
00:04:14,938 --> 00:04:19,607
- We can help.
- Great. Here, take these.

66
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:23,961
Sucks. Yang's turfing
us the crap cases

67
00:04:24,063 --> 00:04:26,376
while she runs outside
for the good ones.

68
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,587
- Uh, Cathy Becker?
- Yes, hi.

69
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:35,023
And you must be
Danny. I'm Dr. Adamson.

70
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:36,870
Can you come this way with me?

71
00:04:36,894 --> 00:04:39,861
- Thanks. Come on.
- All right.

72
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:44,232
We were driving up to Vancouver to
visit my husband. He's up there for work.

73
00:04:44,334 --> 00:04:46,534
The rain wouldn't
let up, so we thought,

74
00:04:46,636 --> 00:04:48,903
"Hey, why don't we
stop for the night".

75
00:04:49,005 --> 00:04:52,807
Bet you wish you'd kept driving,
huh? Can you lean forward

76
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:55,610
and take a deep breath?

77
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:57,913
I'm glad you made it out.

78
00:04:58,015 --> 00:05:00,459
- Thank God we were on the first floor.
- - I was scared.

79
00:05:00,483 --> 00:05:04,185
- My mom getted burned.
- - Mommy's all right, baby.

80
00:05:04,287 --> 00:05:06,838
You're safe. Everybody
is all right, OK?

81
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:09,060
Everybody's safe now.
Can you say "ah" for me?

82
00:05:09,092 --> 00:05:11,709
- Ah.
- Very good.

83
00:05:14,031 --> 00:05:18,533
- See? One for them.
- And one for us.

84
00:05:18,635 --> 00:05:21,986
- Stop being so paranoid.
- They hate us, April.

85
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:24,956
Doesn't matter how good we
are. We'll fail. They were here first

86
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:26,958
and they rule the
school and they hate us.

87
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,661
I'm not gonna let them turn
me into someone they can hate.

88
00:05:29,763 --> 00:05:33,632
- I'm easy to like.
- Actually, it takes a while.

89
00:05:33,734 --> 00:05:36,134
- I hated you at first.
- Just shut up.

90
00:05:36,236 --> 00:05:38,620
Sorry.

91
00:05:38,722 --> 00:05:42,240
OK, your lungs sound
good, your vitals are great.

92
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:45,493
- Um, open up, please?
- Oh, my God!

93
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:53,601
- Charley got a good one.
- See? We win.

94
00:05:55,372 --> 00:05:56,972
OK, um...

95
00:05:57,074 --> 00:05:59,324
You look good. Burns
on your chest are minor,

96
00:05:59,426 --> 00:06:01,375
but the one on your calf
might be third degree,

97
00:06:01,478 --> 00:06:04,695
so what I'm gonna do...
Uh, hang on. Dr. Sloan?

98
00:06:04,797 --> 00:06:08,116
I'm gonna have the plastic
surgeon take a look, OK?

99
00:06:09,336 --> 00:06:11,436
I just did her initial exam.

100
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:14,072
She was a burn patient
and she wasn't surgical.

101
00:06:14,174 --> 00:06:15,974
There was nothing
more for me to do.

102
00:06:16,043 --> 00:06:19,477
- At that point,
you went...?
- I went to go help Dr. Bailey.

103
00:06:23,851 --> 00:06:26,334
Uh! What did I just say?!

104
00:06:27,254 --> 00:06:29,087
I got it!

105
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:32,758
Dr. Bailey really
needed some help.

106
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:41,082
He fainted.

107
00:06:41,184 --> 00:06:42,829
- He fainted?
- He fainted.

108
00:06:42,853 --> 00:06:45,420
- From what?
- Better have a brain tumor,

109
00:06:45,522 --> 00:06:46,988
'cause that's unacceptable.

110
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:51,042
There was a blood drive today.

111
00:06:53,196 --> 00:06:55,041
This place is a freakin' maze.

112
00:06:55,065 --> 00:06:58,216
- I've gotten lost
11 times, no joke.
- I lost a patient.

113
00:06:58,318 --> 00:07:00,146
That's bad, dude. How'd he die?

114
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:03,021
No, I lost her. Parked her in a
hallway, went to get her labs,

115
00:07:03,123 --> 00:07:06,357
couldn't find the hallway.
No one would help me.

116
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:10,812
Yeah, don't even ask for help. These
Seattle Grace people are kinda douchey.

117
00:07:17,403 --> 00:07:19,370
- Case in point.
- Douche.

118
00:07:23,644 --> 00:07:26,161
It's the ER. Mass Casualty.

119
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:29,997
Hey, I need to, uh...

120
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:32,968
Emergency! I'm a surgeon! Hello!

121
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:35,970
Apparently, he grabbed
the fire axe out of the case

122
00:07:36,072 --> 00:07:38,792
- and tried to run
downstairs with it.
- Mom was right.

123
00:07:38,841 --> 00:07:41,109
No running on the stairs.

124
00:07:43,697 --> 00:07:47,765
OK, on my count:
one, two, three.

125
00:07:47,868 --> 00:07:51,553
OK, I want a CBC, chem panel
and make sure there's an OR ready.

126
00:07:51,655 --> 00:07:53,254
Wait, wait. Just stop.

127
00:07:53,356 --> 00:07:55,957
Uh, I need to see
what I'm looking at.

128
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:58,793
- Do you have steady hands?
- Yes, ma'am, in college I...

129
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:02,564
I don't want your life story. I
need both hands on this handle.

130
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:05,066
Do not push the axe in,

131
00:08:05,168 --> 00:08:07,151
do not pull the axe out,

132
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:10,805
- do not move, understand?
- Yep.

133
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:12,891
OK...

134
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:15,977
In retrospect, I should
have had a cookie.

135
00:08:18,281 --> 00:08:20,365
- Wha...?
- Whoa.

136
00:08:24,887 --> 00:08:28,773
Stupid. Stupid,
stupid, stupid, stupid.

137
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,992
- Whoa.
- What did I just say?!

138
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:32,938
- I got it!
- OK.

139
00:08:32,962 --> 00:08:36,798
Apply pressure.
OK, come with me.

140
00:08:40,988 --> 00:08:44,172
Hey, Karev! Clean that up.

141
00:08:50,513 --> 00:08:52,913
- That was the last
you saw the patient?
- Yes.

142
00:08:53,016 --> 00:08:54,460
With Dr. Sloan,
who treated her burn.

143
00:08:54,484 --> 00:08:56,801
No, he didn't. I
treated her burn.

144
00:08:56,903 --> 00:09:01,289
- You did? Where was Sloan?
- Uh, Karev! Clean that up.

145
00:09:01,391 --> 00:09:05,443
OK. Ready? One, two, three,
four, I declare a thumb war, go!

146
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:11,048
I'd say this is deep second-degree.
Start cleaning while I finish debriding.

147
00:09:13,236 --> 00:09:16,237
- Does it hurt?
- A little bit, sweetie, but it's OK.

148
00:09:16,339 --> 00:09:20,858
The doctors are making it all better.
Now, you gotta watch or I'll getcha...

149
00:09:21,945 --> 00:09:23,928
Dr. Sloan? Need you.

150
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,965
Finish debriding, cover the
wound with silver sulfadiazine,

151
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:31,570
- then loose gauze,
loose, not tight.
- I got it.

152
00:09:31,672 --> 00:09:35,006
Evan Lang, 16, second and third
degree burns over 60 percent of his body.

153
00:09:35,108 --> 00:09:38,792
Hey, Grey, come when
you're done, we need hands!

154
00:09:44,618 --> 00:09:47,151
So Robbins was rushing
you? You felt rushed?

155
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:49,487
No, I didn't rush.
I took my time.

156
00:09:55,412 --> 00:09:58,746
- Oh.
- Sorry, I know it hurts.

157
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:03,551
No. No, I'm fine.

158
00:10:04,987 --> 00:10:06,887
I'm just fine.

159
00:10:09,392 --> 00:10:12,160
And then I joined
Dr. Sloan and Dr. Robbins.

160
00:10:13,513 --> 00:10:16,064
OK. This is all set.

161
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:17,798
I'm sorry! Sorry!

162
00:10:17,901 --> 00:10:20,462
- Are you free? I need a hand.
- I'll be right there.

163
00:10:20,486 --> 00:10:23,571
It's OK, you're OK.
We're gonna examine you

164
00:10:23,673 --> 00:10:26,557
and then we'll get you
warmed up again, OK, Evan?

165
00:10:29,745 --> 00:10:32,396
My dad? Where's my dad?

166
00:10:32,498 --> 00:10:34,833
You give me his name
and we'll find him, OK?

167
00:10:34,935 --> 00:10:36,901
He's gotta be
looking for you, too.

168
00:10:40,724 --> 00:10:43,574
Here. For the smell.

169
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:49,931
Listen, burns like this
are really... difficult.

170
00:10:50,033 --> 00:10:51,677
You don't really...

171
00:10:51,701 --> 00:10:54,135
Want to switch with
someone? Karev or somebody?

172
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:56,871
- You think I can't handle this?
- No. No, I...

173
00:10:56,973 --> 00:11:00,108
'Cause I can. I'm
good. I'm here.

174
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:02,660
You stayed with the
patient in the trauma room.

175
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:05,446
I... Yeah, I did.

176
00:11:05,548 --> 00:11:08,149
- And who was with Mrs. Becker?
- Reed Adamson.

177
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:11,852
- OK, this is all set.
- No, I was never
with Mrs. Becker.

178
00:11:11,954 --> 00:11:16,073
I was with her little boy. I had
just finished with him, actually.

179
00:11:16,826 --> 00:11:18,309
I'm sorry! Sorry!

180
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:21,079
- You free? I need a hand.
- I'll be right there.

181
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:26,151
So, good news, big
guy. You are fine.

182
00:11:26,253 --> 00:11:29,387
His pulse-ox looks good,
everything looks good.

183
00:11:29,489 --> 00:11:33,407
- He's totally fine.
- Thank you.

184
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:36,355
Uh, hey, can he stay in here
with me, just until his dad comes?

185
00:11:36,379 --> 00:11:38,813
No problem. It's a
full house anyway.

186
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:42,067
So I went to help Dr. Torres.

187
00:11:42,169 --> 00:11:45,936
Roy Macinaw, 56-year-old firefighter,
fell three stories from a ladder.

188
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:49,757
Looks like a hip and femur fracture,
maybe radius, too. He's waking up.

189
00:11:49,859 --> 00:11:55,596
What happened? I had him...
I... I... I got to the window...

190
00:11:55,698 --> 00:11:58,082
Roy, you fell from the
ladder. It was a bad fall,

191
00:11:58,184 --> 00:12:01,369
but we'll fix you up. Give him ten
of morphine and get him admitted.

192
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:03,337
Where's the kid? I had him.

193
00:12:03,439 --> 00:12:05,806
- He was going after a kid?
- Shepherd!

194
00:12:05,908 --> 00:12:07,525
- Yeah.
- He has uneven pupils.

195
00:12:07,627 --> 00:12:10,611
Abdomen's rigid. He's
gonna need an ultrasound.

196
00:12:10,713 --> 00:12:12,842
Yeah, he needs a head CT, too.

197
00:12:12,866 --> 00:12:14,965
- Page me.
- He needs everything.

198
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:16,328
Take him now, let's go.

199
00:12:16,352 --> 00:12:18,436
And you left the
ER at that point?

200
00:12:18,538 --> 00:12:19,971
I took him to X-ray, yes.

201
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:22,351
Did you hear Mrs. Becker
say anything about pain?

202
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:24,876
- No.
- The nurse did.

203
00:12:24,978 --> 00:12:26,760
He said she was
in a lot of pain.

204
00:12:26,862 --> 00:12:28,996
Whose patient is Bed
One? Cathy Becker?

205
00:12:29,098 --> 00:12:32,066
- Not mine.
- She's complaining of pain.

206
00:12:33,703 --> 00:12:36,603
At this point, who was in
charge of Mrs. Becker's care?

207
00:12:36,706 --> 00:12:39,356
- Whose patient was she?
- I was never on her.

208
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:41,037
I was in the OR with Dr. Bailey.

209
00:12:41,061 --> 00:12:42,138
I'm not... I don't...

210
00:12:42,162 --> 00:12:43,861
- Not mine.
- No idea.

211
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:47,081
- Did you order pain meds?
- No, Yang did.

212
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:52,987
Next time I saw her,
she was... she was dying.

213
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:08,669
When you saw her, she was dying?

214
00:13:08,771 --> 00:13:11,856
No, she wasn't dying. She
said she had some pain.

215
00:13:11,941 --> 00:13:14,141
Whose patient is Bed
One? Cathy Becker?

216
00:13:14,227 --> 00:13:17,728
- Not mine.
- She's complaining of pain.

217
00:13:21,017 --> 00:13:22,850
- Hey, Karev, you got Bed One?
- No.

218
00:13:22,952 --> 00:13:25,170
Your initials are on the chart.

219
00:13:26,256 --> 00:13:27,816
So you checked with Karev?

220
00:13:27,857 --> 00:13:29,401
I tried to. He was on the phone.

221
00:13:29,425 --> 00:13:32,409
I never even seen that patient.
I was stitching up Nosedive.

222
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:36,297
- Nosedive?
- What's-his-name. Dude that fainted.

223
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:40,384
- Dr. Percy.
- Nosedive. That's gonna stick.

224
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:45,356
- So you were with Dr. Percy.
- He was supposed to be.

225
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:47,241
- Karev, you have Bed One?
- No.

226
00:13:47,343 --> 00:13:49,527
Your initials are on the chart.

227
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:52,313
Iz, I'm done.

228
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:55,149
I'm done leaving you messages,
I'm done talking to your mom

229
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:59,052
- who's probably lying to me.
- Are you gonna help me
with this?

230
00:13:59,155 --> 00:14:04,025
Listen, it's been a week, Iz, and I
don't know if you're alive or dead.

231
00:14:04,127 --> 00:14:06,127
So if I don't hear
from you by tonight,

232
00:14:06,229 --> 00:14:10,631
I am calling the police and
reporting you as a missing person.

233
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:25,363
- So who gave her the morphine?
- No idea. I never even saw her!

234
00:14:25,465 --> 00:14:28,149
I ordered it. I did.

235
00:14:28,251 --> 00:14:31,636
Your initials are on the chart.

236
00:14:31,738 --> 00:14:35,089
How long do I have to work here
before they insert a bug up my ass?

237
00:14:35,191 --> 00:14:38,008
You guys are all so cranky.

238
00:14:38,111 --> 00:14:43,247
Dr. Avery seemed uncomfortable
consulting on a patient that wasn't his,

239
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:45,950
so I checked with the patient
and asked about her pain.

240
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:49,053
She said it was localized to her
chest burns so I checked her chart

241
00:14:49,155 --> 00:14:51,189
for any allergies
or drug interactions

242
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:53,691
and saw she had
silver sulfadiazine,

243
00:14:53,793 --> 00:14:57,144
and one gram of cefazolin
and 800 of ibuprofen.

244
00:14:57,246 --> 00:15:00,664
- So I ordered two of morphine.
- You memorized her chart?

245
00:15:00,766 --> 00:15:03,384
I checked it three times
'cause she wasn't my patient.

246
00:15:03,486 --> 00:15:06,687
So you ordered morphine.
Did you follow up?

247
00:15:06,789 --> 00:15:08,956
Uh, no, my patient
had come back from CT.

248
00:15:09,058 --> 00:15:10,975
All right, people! Listen up!

249
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:14,344
The burn unit and the ICU are
full. All patients are staying here

250
00:15:14,447 --> 00:15:17,715
- until some beds open up.
- Let's keep the trauma rooms
clear

251
00:15:17,817 --> 00:15:20,684
- for the burn cases, please.
- Head CT was fine,

252
00:15:20,786 --> 00:15:23,054
abdominal scans show liver
lac and kidney hematoma.

253
00:15:23,156 --> 00:15:25,200
I'll go check on an OR.
Page me when he's stable.

254
00:15:25,224 --> 00:15:28,892
Uh-huh.

255
00:15:28,995 --> 00:15:29,877
That's him.

256
00:15:29,979 --> 00:15:32,463
The kid. The kid in the window.

257
00:15:32,565 --> 00:15:34,265
Is he dying?

258
00:15:34,367 --> 00:15:36,684
I don't know what he's here for.

259
00:15:36,786 --> 00:15:38,535
He's fine, he's
being taken care of.

260
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:41,021
- You saved his life.
- Oh, no!

261
00:15:41,123 --> 00:15:45,993
No... I killed him.

262
00:15:46,095 --> 00:15:51,332
Can I ask something? You say the patient
asked for meds for pains in her chest?

263
00:15:51,434 --> 00:15:53,100
No, on her chest, she had burns.

264
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:55,213
All right. Thank you, Dr. Yang.

265
00:15:55,237 --> 00:15:59,023
Are you saying she had chest
pains? I ordered the wrong medication?

266
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:01,843
It's hard to say. The next
entry on her chart was Dr. Grey

267
00:16:01,944 --> 00:16:04,779
- putting in a chest tube...
- Thank you, Dr. Yang.

268
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:07,114
- Meredith?
- No, Lexie.

269
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:11,235
- I thought Lexie
was on the burned kid.
- Thank you, Dr. Yang!

270
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:15,539
I was. I was supposed to be with
the burned ki... with Evan Lang.

271
00:16:18,127 --> 00:16:21,529
All right, people! Listen up!
The burn unit and the ICU are full.

272
00:16:21,631 --> 00:16:23,791
All patients stay here
until some beds open up.

273
00:16:23,867 --> 00:16:27,635
Let's keep the trauma rooms
clear for burn cases, please.

274
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:31,517
- I can't get
a pulse on the doppler.
- OK.

275
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:35,042
Evan, I have to do an escharotomy.
I have to cut into the burned skin

276
00:16:35,144 --> 00:16:37,995
- to restore circulation
to your arm.
- Did you find my dad?

277
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:41,482
I'll ask again in a sec, OK?
Push another 25 of fentanyl.

278
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:44,369
Evan, you're gonna
talk to me, all right?

279
00:16:44,471 --> 00:16:46,231
You're in town
looking at a college?

280
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:48,622
I got a scholarship to Cornish.

281
00:16:48,724 --> 00:16:54,178
I'm not sure I
can take the rain.

282
00:16:58,084 --> 00:16:59,550
No! No!

283
00:16:59,652 --> 00:17:03,136
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I know.
You're OK, pal. You're gonna be OK.

284
00:17:03,238 --> 00:17:05,823
That's what I thought at
first, too. About the rain.

285
00:17:05,925 --> 00:17:10,361
Dr. Grey, you grew up here,
right? You get used to the rain...

286
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:14,115
Lexie!

287
00:17:14,217 --> 00:17:17,151
Dr. Grey, step out. Come
back when you've got it together.

288
00:17:17,253 --> 00:17:19,053
Go.

289
00:17:27,881 --> 00:17:30,531
- She can't breathe.
- It's OK. I'm OK.

290
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:32,733
My mom. She can't breathe.

291
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:44,528
- It was a pneumothorax.
- What's that?

292
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:47,214
Her lung collapsed.

293
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:51,485
One, two, three.

294
00:17:51,587 --> 00:17:54,238
Danny! Don't let him see me die.

295
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:56,541
You're not gonna die, I promise.

296
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:59,810
- One, two, three.
- - You got the chest tube in?

297
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,158
- No, I was getting there...
- Did you go in below

298
00:18:02,182 --> 00:18:05,116
the fifth intercostal? You could
have punctured her diaphragm.

299
00:18:05,218 --> 00:18:06,951
- I know, I lost count.
- Why?!

300
00:18:07,053 --> 00:18:10,687
Three, four, five...

301
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,075
Did you get the chest tube in?!

302
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,399
I did. I did!

303
00:18:21,501 --> 00:18:24,568
- I just...
- She did, she just
missed a step.

304
00:18:24,671 --> 00:18:27,772
One, two, three, four...

305
00:18:32,394 --> 00:18:36,347
- Why did you do that?!
- I had to. She was running
out of time.

306
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:39,217
Tension pneumothorax. Relieve
pressure so she doesn't croak

307
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:41,818
before you put
the chest tube in.

308
00:18:41,905 --> 00:18:44,988
- You want me to do it?
- No. I can do it. I got it.

309
00:18:46,476 --> 00:18:50,694
- Three, four, five.
- And did she have it?

310
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:53,397
Yeah, I watched. She
was a little distracted, but...

311
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:54,999
You were distracted?

312
00:18:55,101 --> 00:18:57,562
- What were you...?
- Dr. Yang was making
a toddler cry!

313
00:18:57,586 --> 00:19:01,805
Stop! What the
hell are you doing?

314
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:07,511
Let me just say, for the
record, that it was no toddler.

315
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:10,142
- He was, like, five if he was a day.
- - Yang...

316
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:12,283
- You would have yelled at him!
- Why was he there?

317
00:19:12,385 --> 00:19:14,701
I don't know how. The
patient was coding...

318
00:19:14,803 --> 00:19:17,504
- The patient was coding?
- Coags are stable.

319
00:19:17,607 --> 00:19:20,552
Good. OR's ready. Let's take
him up. Yang, you're with me.

320
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:23,327
Torres, Adamson, call you
when we're ready for the femur.

321
00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:26,513
Your whole crew's in the
waiting room. They'll see you after.

322
00:19:26,615 --> 00:19:29,733
- They're saying you're a hero.
- Tell him I'm sorry.

323
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:32,203
Tell him I'm so sorry.

324
00:19:32,305 --> 00:19:34,822
- Who's he talking about?
- The kid in Trauma Two.

325
00:19:34,924 --> 00:19:38,025
- Roy, he's fine.
- I almost had him.

326
00:19:38,127 --> 00:19:41,695
I was at the window. I could
feel his fingers in my hand.

327
00:19:41,798 --> 00:19:43,875
I went to pull him out and...

328
00:19:43,899 --> 00:19:47,017
I missed the step.
One stupid mistake...

329
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:50,304
- You fell, Roy. It was an accident.
- He was burning!

330
00:19:51,674 --> 00:19:54,324
And I...

331
00:19:54,427 --> 00:19:57,077
- V-tach! No pulse!
- Start CPR, bag him,

332
00:19:57,197 --> 00:19:59,796
- push one of epi!
- Charging to 200!

333
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:07,872
Or that works, too.

334
00:20:08,992 --> 00:20:10,825
Thanks. Had it.

335
00:20:14,163 --> 00:20:19,400
Stop! What the
hell are you doing?

336
00:20:19,502 --> 00:20:22,214
- Who was watching that kid?
- That's what I said!

337
00:20:22,238 --> 00:20:25,589
- Hey. Who is watching this kid?
- I took the kid.

338
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:27,041
He was with me.

339
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:30,544
But I can't watch him, I'm
supposed to be in Trauma Two.

340
00:20:40,873 --> 00:20:43,740
All right, I got
him. I'll take him.

341
00:20:44,377 --> 00:20:47,044
Come on.

342
00:20:47,146 --> 00:20:49,930
- You left his mother alone.
- - She was stable.

343
00:20:50,032 --> 00:20:51,676
I was supposed
to be with the boy.

344
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,429
His mother had a collapsed lung.

345
00:20:53,453 --> 00:20:56,053
Not that boy, I was supposed
to be with the other boy.

346
00:20:56,155 --> 00:20:58,139
Want something
to eat for dinner?

347
00:20:58,241 --> 00:21:00,724
- What the hell are you doing?
- I have to sit with him

348
00:21:00,826 --> 00:21:02,993
until his dad comes.
I left him alone and...

349
00:21:03,096 --> 00:21:05,630
You left him! Come here.

350
00:21:05,732 --> 00:21:08,716
Hey, can you sit with him
until his dad comes? Thanks.

351
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:13,971
You left him alone. When
were you planning to...?

352
00:21:14,073 --> 00:21:18,058
- I'm sorry, I feel like...
- No. You don't get to feel
anything!

353
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:21,812
Because he's feeling everything!
His every nerve is exposed and raw

354
00:21:21,914 --> 00:21:24,615
and we have to make him
feel worse before he feels better.

355
00:21:24,717 --> 00:21:27,501
So if you're having
feelings, you shut them down.

356
00:21:27,603 --> 00:21:29,820
You shut them down and
talk to him about his future

357
00:21:29,922 --> 00:21:33,257
and remind him that he has one, past
all his pain. And if you can't do that,

358
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:37,595
if you can't do your job, then find
someone who can and send them to me.

359
00:21:39,448 --> 00:21:41,393
Did you see Mrs. Becker again?

360
00:21:41,417 --> 00:21:42,699
No.

361
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:45,002
Did you see Karev
perform a cricothyrotomy?

362
00:21:45,104 --> 00:21:47,688
- I wasn't there.
- I was right there. I saw it.

363
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:50,908
Then find someone who
can and send them to me.

364
00:21:52,845 --> 00:21:55,680
Have you seen Karev?
He didn't finish my stitches.

365
00:21:55,782 --> 00:21:58,399
No, I don't...

366
00:22:01,971 --> 00:22:03,604
Doctor?! She's not breathing.

367
00:22:03,706 --> 00:22:06,773
Move. Get me a seven-ET tube.

368
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:15,382
Aah! Crap. She's
completely closed off.

369
00:22:15,484 --> 00:22:17,985
- I can't see her cords.
- You can't intubate a patient?

370
00:22:18,087 --> 00:22:20,754
Of course I can. I just...
I was having trouble.

371
00:22:20,856 --> 00:22:23,991
Her airway was closed
off. I couldn't tube her either.

372
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:28,696
What's going on?

373
00:22:28,798 --> 00:22:31,832
There's too much swelling in the
airway. Get me a smaller tube, a 6-0.

374
00:22:31,934 --> 00:22:33,450
6-0, here you go.

375
00:22:36,238 --> 00:22:38,038
- Damn it!
- Move!

376
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:39,801
Did Karev try to intubate?

377
00:22:39,825 --> 00:22:41,545
First Charles tried to tube her,

378
00:22:41,593 --> 00:22:43,994
then Reed came to help,
then Karev performed the crike.

379
00:22:44,096 --> 00:22:46,576
- I thought you didn't see it.
- I did.

380
00:22:46,666 --> 00:22:49,533
And you didn't try and help?

381
00:22:49,635 --> 00:22:53,837
Too much swelling in the airway.
Get me a smaller tube, a 6-0!

382
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,472
6-0, here you go.

383
00:22:56,876 --> 00:22:59,309
Move! She needs a crike!

384
00:23:07,936 --> 00:23:09,770
My patient needed me.

385
00:23:12,675 --> 00:23:15,108
OK. Here's the
thing about the rain.

386
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:18,612
It usually just drizzles.
It's not like tonight.

387
00:23:18,714 --> 00:23:20,680
But when it stops,

388
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:24,301
everything is super
green and it's beautiful

389
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:28,872
and it smells like trees.
You know that smell?

390
00:23:35,631 --> 00:23:37,697
Dr. Karev seemed to
have it under control.

391
00:23:37,799 --> 00:23:41,101
- Karev seemed
totally out of control.
- Move! She needs a crike.

392
00:23:41,204 --> 00:23:45,355
- Give me an Ambu bag.
- He was pale, shaky.

393
00:23:45,458 --> 00:23:47,241
Just really unsteady.

394
00:23:47,343 --> 00:23:49,783
She's got no landmarks.
I was hoping that...

395
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:53,497
What are you...?
You're going in blind?

396
00:23:57,853 --> 00:24:00,136
Hit the carotid.
Hit the carotid.

397
00:24:00,238 --> 00:24:03,690
He kept saying something
about hitting her carotid.

398
00:24:20,392 --> 00:24:22,693
Did you give blood
today, Dr. Karev?

399
00:24:22,795 --> 00:24:24,261
What?

400
00:24:24,363 --> 00:24:27,965
You've been described as
looking pale, shaky and unsteady.

401
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:31,352
We already had one doctor pass
out after giving blood. I'm asking...

402
00:24:31,453 --> 00:24:36,206
We all give blood. Avery gave blood,
Yang gave blood, Grey gave blood.

403
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:40,276
I give blood every two months. Because
some dumbass didn't eat a cookie...

404
00:24:40,379 --> 00:24:43,814
I'm asking if you gave
blood today, Dr. Karev.

405
00:24:50,139 --> 00:24:51,838
No.

406
00:24:51,941 --> 00:24:55,276
And you haven't heard
from her since then?

407
00:24:57,947 --> 00:25:00,714
You'll tell me if she calls?

408
00:25:01,384 --> 00:25:03,217
Right.

409
00:25:03,319 --> 00:25:05,085
I know, Robbie.

410
00:25:05,187 --> 00:25:06,865
- Thanks.
- Don't even ask for help.

411
00:25:06,889 --> 00:25:09,423
These Seattle Grace
people are kinda douchey.

412
00:25:14,313 --> 00:25:17,181
- Case in point.
- Douche.

413
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:23,387
Wait, wait. Don't
stick me. I gotta go.

414
00:25:23,489 --> 00:25:25,889
Sorry.

415
00:25:25,991 --> 00:25:28,993
- So what was the problem?
- There was no problem.

416
00:25:29,094 --> 00:25:33,263
There was a problem. I came back
from seeing the firefighter up to surgery.

417
00:25:36,402 --> 00:25:39,403
Hey, my guys would
like to line the hall for Roy

418
00:25:39,505 --> 00:25:41,872
when he comes out of
surgery, make a show of support.

419
00:25:41,974 --> 00:25:46,743
- He's 35 years
on the job, so...
- That's great.

420
00:25:46,845 --> 00:25:48,495
Excuse me.

421
00:25:48,597 --> 00:25:52,182
And there was a problem and
Charles waved me over to help.

422
00:25:52,284 --> 00:25:54,268
I wasn't waving at Reed,
I was waving at Karev.

423
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:57,104
- But he wouldn't
get off the phone!
- He what?

424
00:25:57,206 --> 00:26:01,275
Crap, she's closed off.
I can't see her cords.

425
00:26:01,376 --> 00:26:03,577
So we can talk.

426
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:06,779
- I hung up the phone.
- What the hell was so
important?

427
00:26:06,882 --> 00:26:09,649
I hung up the phone, I
came over and I criked her.

428
00:26:09,751 --> 00:26:12,352
After a doctor got there
first. A patient was dying.

429
00:26:12,471 --> 00:26:16,089
Look, I hung up the phone!

430
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:18,992
Ow! Yeah, that's
good and tight, there.

431
00:26:19,111 --> 00:26:21,344
Ow!

432
00:26:27,202 --> 00:26:28,518
Hello? Izzie?

433
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,387
Iz.

434
00:26:31,123 --> 00:26:32,506
Uh...

435
00:26:34,493 --> 00:26:36,994
Hello, Iz?

436
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:39,176
- Hey!
- Where are you? Are you OK?

437
00:26:39,231 --> 00:26:43,717
- I know, your mom said she didn't...
- - You left him alone!

438
00:26:43,819 --> 00:26:46,270
- When were you planning...?
- Sorry. I feel like...

439
00:26:46,372 --> 00:26:51,925
I'm asking you to wait,
please. No, I got... Just wait!

440
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:55,862
Iz. Just come home
and we can talk about it.

441
00:26:55,964 --> 00:26:57,775
Move. Get me a seven-ET tube.

442
00:26:57,799 --> 00:26:59,433
What does that mean?

443
00:26:59,535 --> 00:27:02,286
- Coming through.
- You're not coming back yet?

444
00:27:02,388 --> 00:27:04,254
Or you're not coming back?

445
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:07,307
Just... Wait, wait.

446
00:27:08,377 --> 00:27:10,777
What's going on?

447
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,379
Iz, just give me a number.

448
00:27:12,481 --> 00:27:15,816
Give me a number and I'll call
you back. Give me a number so...

449
00:27:15,918 --> 00:27:17,884
I have to... Just
give me a number!

450
00:27:17,986 --> 00:27:20,337
Give me a smaller tube, a 6-0.

451
00:27:20,923 --> 00:27:22,839
I... wait.

452
00:27:22,941 --> 00:27:24,621
- Izzie, just...
- Damn it.

453
00:27:26,462 --> 00:27:30,881
- Move! She needs a crike.
- Ambu bag.

454
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:34,418
She's got no landmarks,
I was hoping...

455
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:37,688
What are you...?
You're going in blind?

456
00:27:40,776 --> 00:27:43,460
Don't hit the carotid,
don't hit the carotid,

457
00:27:43,562 --> 00:27:46,830
don't hit the carotid,
don't hit the carotid.

458
00:27:56,525 --> 00:27:59,059
Got it. Start ventilating.

459
00:28:09,655 --> 00:28:13,740
I got there in
time. I did the crike.

460
00:28:16,445 --> 00:28:18,679
I got off the phone.

461
00:28:23,268 --> 00:28:26,303
- I stayed with her after that.
- - You had her under control.

462
00:28:26,405 --> 00:28:27,838
It was a good crike.

463
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:31,742
She was stable. Then, out of
nowhere, we started to lose her.

464
00:28:31,844 --> 00:28:34,794
She's got pulmonary edema.
Switch to jet ventilation.

465
00:28:34,896 --> 00:28:39,499
Get a CBC, lytes, ABG. Just
shotgun her, get everything.

466
00:28:39,601 --> 00:28:42,653
She had ARDS, BP was
dropping, we started fluids.

467
00:28:42,755 --> 00:28:45,939
- She was sinking fast.
- Trauma One's clear. Move her.

468
00:28:46,041 --> 00:28:48,491
- What happened? Why is she...?
- I don't know!

469
00:28:48,594 --> 00:28:50,877
Hey! Can you give me a hand?

470
00:28:54,432 --> 00:28:56,466
Somebody page Hunt
and get me those labs!

471
00:28:56,568 --> 00:29:00,053
I got her labs. I was shocked.

472
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:02,722
You're AK, right? April Kepner?

473
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:05,375
Uh... No, no.
This is Alex Karev.

474
00:29:06,245 --> 00:29:08,478
Wait a second... What the hell?

475
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:11,431
Her carbon monoxide level was
28 and she was spiraling down.

476
00:29:13,618 --> 00:29:17,020
BP's 69 over 32. Pulse is 158.

477
00:29:17,105 --> 00:29:20,673
We're already filling
her with fluids. Yeah.

478
00:29:20,775 --> 00:29:24,178
She was acidotic.
We pushed bicarb.

479
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,829
They needed more hands.

480
00:29:25,931 --> 00:29:28,031
Keep her on 100 percent
oxygen. No, do not,

481
00:29:28,134 --> 00:29:33,469
not until she's more stable. Cristina,
scrub out, go see if you can help. Go!

482
00:29:33,571 --> 00:29:36,139
There was so much swelling,
we couldn't find good veins,

483
00:29:36,241 --> 00:29:38,081
we had to start a central line.

484
00:29:39,128 --> 00:29:42,378
We can't use a hyperbaric
chamber until she's stable.

485
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,016
Her CK level is over 75,000.
She's got fulminant rhabdo.

486
00:29:46,118 --> 00:29:49,553
Everything was failing:
the kidneys, liver, lungs.

487
00:29:49,655 --> 00:29:51,365
Her chart was like
a phone book now.

488
00:29:51,389 --> 00:29:53,757
She's in SVT. Push
6 of adenosine.

489
00:29:53,859 --> 00:29:56,019
Systolic's in the 70s.
Start dopamine, 5 mikes.

490
00:29:56,094 --> 00:29:57,739
She was coding when I got there.

491
00:29:57,763 --> 00:30:00,447
What the hell?!

492
00:30:00,549 --> 00:30:03,683
- She's in V-fib!
- OK, starting manual
ventilation.

493
00:30:07,021 --> 00:30:09,105
Charging to 200.

494
00:30:11,627 --> 00:30:12,904
Clear!

495
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:17,630
Three hundred!

496
00:30:17,732 --> 00:30:20,517
Clear!

497
00:30:21,703 --> 00:30:23,386
Oh, there's blood... Wait!

498
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,339
She started bleeding out.

499
00:30:25,441 --> 00:30:28,541
She's got blood in her crike
tube. She's got blood in the tube!

500
00:30:36,184 --> 00:30:37,484
Oh, my God.

501
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,827
I know what happened.

502
00:30:48,964 --> 00:30:50,830
I know why she died.

503
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:56,619
- No, it's fine!
- Get an amp of bicarb.

504
00:30:56,721 --> 00:31:00,257
- Push one of epi.
- What about calcium?

505
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:02,692
Get two more units...
Bring some FFP.

506
00:31:02,794 --> 00:31:04,589
Where's all this
blood coming from?

507
00:31:04,613 --> 00:31:05,853
DIC. Organs are shutting down.

508
00:31:05,914 --> 00:31:07,658
- No, no!
- She's bleeding out!

509
00:31:07,682 --> 00:31:09,762
Just stop!

510
00:31:09,818 --> 00:31:13,019
Stop! Everybody, stop!
It's over! You've lost her.

511
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:16,423
Somebody call it.

512
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:23,397
Well, whose patient is she?

513
00:31:26,568 --> 00:31:28,886
Whose patient is this?

514
00:31:47,973 --> 00:31:51,274
I'm sorry. I am so, so sorry.

515
00:31:51,376 --> 00:31:52,992
Dr. Kepner?

516
00:31:59,767 --> 00:32:02,185
What did you tell
them? What did you say?

517
00:32:17,903 --> 00:32:19,536
I don't know you.

518
00:32:19,638 --> 00:32:23,006
But Dr. Adamson just
spent 20 minutes in that chair

519
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:25,592
telling me what an
excellent doctor you are.

520
00:32:25,694 --> 00:32:28,895
Your school records, your
evaluations from Mercy West,

521
00:32:28,997 --> 00:32:33,700
all say the same
thing. And I believe it.

522
00:32:33,802 --> 00:32:35,835
I believe you're good.

523
00:32:35,937 --> 00:32:38,533
- Dr. Webber, I don't...
- So you should be able
to tell me

524
00:32:38,557 --> 00:32:41,357
what would have caused
Cathy Becker to bleed out

525
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:44,794
and die from
multi-system organ failure.

526
00:32:46,231 --> 00:32:50,450
She had DIC. Burns can
cause massive tissue injury.

527
00:32:50,552 --> 00:32:52,552
The burn was
cleaned and dressed.

528
00:32:52,588 --> 00:32:55,705
There must have been more
damage. She had a collapsed lung.

529
00:32:55,791 --> 00:32:57,490
That's right.

530
00:32:57,592 --> 00:32:59,726
She needed a chest tube.

531
00:33:02,181 --> 00:33:05,916
But why would her
lungs have failed?

532
00:33:06,018 --> 00:33:10,153
She went into respiratory
distress. They said they criked her.

533
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:14,027
I wasn't there for this.

534
00:33:14,109 --> 00:33:16,293
Why would she need a
crike? Why not intubate?

535
00:33:16,394 --> 00:33:17,894
Her airway was too swollen.

536
00:33:17,997 --> 00:33:21,264
What would cause that kind
of inflammation in her throat?

537
00:33:21,367 --> 00:33:24,101
Soot? Smoke inhalation?

538
00:33:24,203 --> 00:33:26,920
How did Mrs.
Becker's throat look?

539
00:33:31,393 --> 00:33:33,393
She wasn't hoarse.
She wasn't coughing...

540
00:33:33,495 --> 00:33:36,629
- How did it look?
- Her breath sounds were good, she...

541
00:33:36,731 --> 00:33:39,065
What I'm asking you...

542
00:33:40,869 --> 00:33:43,202
what it looked like.

543
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:57,734
OK, your lungs sound good
and your vitals are great.

544
00:33:57,820 --> 00:34:01,671
- Open up, please?
- Oh, my God!

545
00:34:18,123 --> 00:34:21,908
OK, um... You look good. These
burns on your chest are pretty minor,

546
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:24,994
but the one on your calf
might be third degree.

547
00:34:25,097 --> 00:34:27,230
You never looked.

548
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,446
You didn't look in her throat,

549
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:34,471
because if you had,
you would have seen soot

550
00:34:34,573 --> 00:34:37,674
and you would have
intubated immediately.

551
00:34:37,776 --> 00:34:39,616
And none of this
would have happened.

552
00:34:39,645 --> 00:34:42,223
- That's... It... I got distracted...
- I know.

553
00:34:42,247 --> 00:34:44,114
- It was insane.
- I know.

554
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:47,984
It was a simple mistake.

555
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:50,086
And the circumstances
you were under...

556
00:35:00,732 --> 00:35:03,899
I'm sorry, Dr. Kepner.

557
00:35:04,002 --> 00:35:07,170
- I missed one step. I...
- No.

558
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:11,658
And look what it's led to.

559
00:35:23,522 --> 00:35:27,273
- She's bleeding out.
- Just stop. Stop! Everybody,
stop!

560
00:35:27,392 --> 00:35:30,143
It's over. You've lost her.

561
00:35:33,415 --> 00:35:35,348
Well, whose patient is she?

562
00:35:38,152 --> 00:35:40,353
Whose patient is this?

563
00:35:44,693 --> 00:35:47,359
Time of death is 12:45am.

564
00:36:06,314 --> 00:36:08,214
You're fired.

565
00:36:57,349 --> 00:37:00,666
Oh, my God, Danny! Oh, my God.

566
00:37:01,319 --> 00:37:03,686
Oh.

567
00:37:03,788 --> 00:37:05,354
You're OK.

568
00:37:06,425 --> 00:37:09,776
Where's Mommy, pal?
Let's go find Mommy. Huh?

569
00:37:09,878 --> 00:37:13,412
<i>When we're headed toward an
outcome that's too horrible to face...</i>

570
00:37:17,151 --> 00:37:20,353
<i>that's when we go looking
for a second opinion.</i>

571
00:37:22,524 --> 00:37:25,241
It's not the doctors, Richard.

572
00:37:27,028 --> 00:37:29,045
They're all good doctors.

573
00:37:29,147 --> 00:37:30,696
I know that.

574
00:37:33,885 --> 00:37:36,903
What do you think this was for?

575
00:37:37,005 --> 00:37:42,258
For Jennings, it was about
legal, but this was for me.

576
00:37:43,512 --> 00:37:46,679
I needed to know who
finally was responsible.

577
00:37:49,268 --> 00:37:51,635
At least I was able to do that.

578
00:38:02,797 --> 00:38:06,966
- Say it, Derek.
- Maybe it's not one doctor.

579
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,953
Maybe it's too many doctors,

580
00:38:11,055 --> 00:38:14,440
who don't know each other
and who don't trust each other.

581
00:38:18,063 --> 00:38:22,598
When I got to that
room, it was chaos.

582
00:38:23,568 --> 00:38:27,136
Because that's the
system now. Chaos.

583
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:33,710
That has been the system that
has been in place since this merger.

584
00:38:34,913 --> 00:38:36,745
Your system.

585
00:38:39,701 --> 00:38:43,135
I'm saying you should look
again at who's responsible.

586
00:38:50,929 --> 00:38:52,762
<i>And sometimes...</i>

587
00:38:59,087 --> 00:39:02,706
<i>the answer we get just
confirms our worst fears.</i>

588
00:39:10,532 --> 00:39:13,532
<i>But sometimes...</i>

589
00:39:17,105 --> 00:39:20,372
<i>it can shed new
light on the problem.</i>

590
00:39:23,712 --> 00:39:26,779
<i>Make you see it in
a whole new way.</i>

591
00:39:35,857 --> 00:39:37,723
Is she gone? Did she leave?

592
00:39:40,528 --> 00:39:45,198
She was good. She was
a better doctor than I am.

593
00:39:46,451 --> 00:39:49,535
Just please shut up.

594
00:39:51,105 --> 00:39:54,640
- Hey. You talk to April?
- No, I haven't.

595
00:39:57,929 --> 00:39:59,378
What?

596
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:02,381
I'm just waiting to see if
you're gonna try to hit me again.

597
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:07,187
- I'm sorry. I was just...
- Forget it. Rough night, right?

598
00:40:08,623 --> 00:40:11,507
So April missed the
airway? That's so stupid.

599
00:40:11,609 --> 00:40:14,961
- "Airway first."
- That's med school 101, right?

600
00:40:15,063 --> 00:40:16,462
It's pretty basic.

601
00:40:16,564 --> 00:40:21,033
It was one second! She got
distracted and she made a mistake.

602
00:40:21,135 --> 00:40:24,170
- That we all nearly
got fired for.
- Nosedive's got a point.

603
00:40:24,272 --> 00:40:26,266
- Thank you... What?
- We nearly got fired

604
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:29,058
for trying to fix what she
screwed up in the first place.

605
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,977
Because that's our job!

606
00:40:31,946 --> 00:40:33,997
You didn't make
any mistakes today?

607
00:40:34,099 --> 00:40:39,218
You've been distracted for the week.
Who knows what you screwed up.

608
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:42,221
But our patients didn't die,
that's why we didn't get caught.

609
00:40:42,323 --> 00:40:44,223
It could have happened
to any one of us.

610
00:40:44,325 --> 00:40:47,093
<i>After all the opinions
have been heard...</i>

611
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:51,397
<i>and every point of view
has been considered...</i>

612
00:40:51,499 --> 00:40:53,233
Here she comes.

613
00:40:59,574 --> 00:41:01,140
<i>You finally find...</i>

614
00:41:02,527 --> 00:41:05,794
<i>- what you were after.</i>
<i>- </i> April.

615
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,199
<i>The truth.</i>

616
00:41:24,983 --> 00:41:27,583
<i>But the truth isn't
where it ends.</i>

617
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:33,373
Thank God. I was beginning to think
you went home and left me here to rot.

618
00:41:35,443 --> 00:41:37,743
- Go home.
- That's it?

619
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:40,990
- Ready to go?
- Very.

620
00:41:41,082 --> 00:41:43,766
I've been waiting
for Bailey all night.

621
00:41:47,572 --> 00:41:49,922
<i>That's just where
you begin again.</i>

622
00:41:52,493 --> 00:41:55,194
- You OK?
- Yeah.

623
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:58,063
Let's go home.

624
00:42:06,858 --> 00:42:09,258
What happened today?

625
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:12,128
<i>With a whole new
set of questions.</i>
