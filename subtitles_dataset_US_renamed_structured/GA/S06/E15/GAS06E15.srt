1
00:00:02,903 --> 00:00:06,538
<i>I've seen a lot of surgery
residents come and go in my time.</i>

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,009
<i>And they're all
addicted... to surgery.</i>

3
00:00:10,111 --> 00:00:16,214
<i>It comes before food, before sleep.
It becomes the most important thing.</i>

4
00:00:16,316 --> 00:00:19,951
- What?
- Nothing.

5
00:00:20,054 --> 00:00:23,672
- Well, go away.
- You look nice.

6
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:26,625
Go away!

7
00:00:26,727 --> 00:00:28,793
<i>The only thing.</i>

8
00:00:30,197 --> 00:00:34,066
<i>What they don't know,
is that living on that high...</i>

9
00:00:35,136 --> 00:00:37,136
<i>can eat them alive.</i>

10
00:00:37,238 --> 00:00:39,338
- I can't do it.
- Of course you can.

11
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,490
- I'm gonna hurl again.
- OK, please don't,

12
00:00:41,592 --> 00:00:43,303
'cause I just got the
last puke out of your hair.

13
00:00:43,327 --> 00:00:46,010
Why do I have to do this?
I'm not a public speaker.

14
00:00:46,113 --> 00:00:48,124
It's not my thing. I
hate Derek Shepherd.

15
00:00:48,148 --> 00:00:49,843
All you have to do is talk
about being a great surgeon.

16
00:00:49,867 --> 00:00:54,302
To a giant room full of
people. From a giant stage.

17
00:00:54,404 --> 00:00:56,921
Oh, God, with a microphone.

18
00:00:57,023 --> 00:01:02,160
Some make it through, they
come out on the other side.

19
00:01:03,263 --> 00:01:08,200
They survive with
their sanity intact.

20
00:01:10,204 --> 00:01:16,308
They become better
doctors and stronger people.

21
00:01:17,944 --> 00:01:19,378
I didn't.

22
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:22,881
I broke.

23
00:01:22,983 --> 00:01:28,002
I didn't kill anybody... and I
give thanks for that every day.

24
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:31,323
But I hurt people.

25
00:01:32,392 --> 00:01:34,993
And scared the
hell out of myself.

26
00:01:37,014 --> 00:01:40,181
I'm 45 days sober today.

27
00:01:40,283 --> 00:01:42,100
I am Richard,

28
00:01:42,202 --> 00:01:46,772
and I am a grateful
and recovering alcoholic.

29
00:01:55,533 --> 00:01:58,534
I was told, if I went to rehab,
my job would be waiting for me.

30
00:01:58,636 --> 00:02:02,070
Pending board approval.
I'm sorry, Richard.

31
00:02:02,172 --> 00:02:04,339
You know what? Maybe
they'll reassess in a few months.

32
00:02:04,441 --> 00:02:08,843
I'm authorized to offer you a position
as an attending general surgeon.

33
00:02:11,748 --> 00:02:15,066
- You want me
to come work under you?
- Yes. That's the stipulation.

34
00:02:15,151 --> 00:02:19,421
Thank you for the offer, but
no. I'll figure something else out.

35
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:26,795
Richard. It's lecture day,
and I have an open spot.

36
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:29,931
Lecture day? You
brought that back?

37
00:02:30,033 --> 00:02:31,595
I understand if you
don't want to come back.

38
00:02:31,619 --> 00:02:35,820
But if you're really leaving this
place, don't leave the way you did.

39
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:38,006
Give one last lecture.

40
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:48,378
Good morning.

41
00:02:48,402 --> 00:02:49,768
Good morning, everybody.

42
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:53,421
Good morning. I'm excited.

43
00:02:53,941 --> 00:02:55,189
Are you excited?

44
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,829
This is a teaching hospital.
We learn a lot by doing.

45
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:06,467
But we can also learn... we should also
learn from other people's experiences.

46
00:03:06,569 --> 00:03:12,340
Their losses will save you losses.
Their mistakes will save you mistakes.

47
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:15,076
Their victories
will inspire yours.

48
00:03:15,178 --> 00:03:17,946
Let's pay close attention.
This is gonna be good.

49
00:03:18,048 --> 00:03:20,014
Dr. Miranda Bailey.

50
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,891
- Good morning, everyone.
- Morning.

51
00:03:33,596 --> 00:03:36,281
- Ow!
- 'Morning, Dr. Yang.

52
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:37,877
What the...?

53
00:03:37,901 --> 00:03:39,967
If I have to stand
here, you have to listen.

54
00:03:40,069 --> 00:03:43,638
Eyes forward. Answer a
question right, you get a chocolate.

55
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:48,927
Doze off, you get beaned in the face.
Ask Dr. Yang. My aim is exceptional.

56
00:03:50,497 --> 00:03:55,750
2003. I'm three days
into my intern year.

57
00:03:56,386 --> 00:03:57,786
Anyone?

58
00:03:57,887 --> 00:04:00,533
Alicia Tatum, status
post-oophorectomy three months ago

59
00:04:00,557 --> 00:04:03,475
now presents with fever
and non-focal abdominal pain.

60
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:05,160
OK, what does her workup show?

61
00:04:05,262 --> 00:04:07,896
Multiple stones
and wall thickening.

62
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:09,448
Excuse me?

63
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:11,750
Multiple gallbladder
stones and wall thickening.

64
00:04:11,852 --> 00:04:14,030
Would you recommend we
do it open or laparoscopically?

65
00:04:14,054 --> 00:04:16,437
- Laparascopically.
- Uh...

66
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:20,492
Who said that? Who said that?

67
00:04:22,946 --> 00:04:24,145
Sir.

68
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:30,719
- You've had
a pretty rough go of it?
- Nothing helps the pain.

69
00:04:30,821 --> 00:04:33,571
I've seen more
doctors than I can count.

70
00:04:33,674 --> 00:04:37,442
Hopefully we'll
be the last. Eight.

71
00:04:37,544 --> 00:04:40,445
We're gonna get to
the bottom of this, OK?

72
00:04:41,932 --> 00:04:43,965
Let's prep her for surgery.

73
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:49,203
You.

74
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:54,692
- Uh... Mandy.
- Mandy? That's
what you're going with?

75
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:57,728
Boy, your parents wanted
you to work for it, huh?

76
00:04:57,814 --> 00:05:00,365
Draw some blood and
take her for her pre-op X-ray.

77
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:04,035
- I was wondering...
- Blood draw is too much for you?

78
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:08,940
- No, I can draw blood,
I just wanted...
- You don't have wants or needs.

79
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:11,709
You're an intern, the bottom
of the surgical food chain.

80
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:14,563
I'm a resident. I've
been here three years,

81
00:05:14,665 --> 00:05:17,148
you've been here three days.
Do the math. Draw her blood.

82
00:05:18,952 --> 00:05:20,668
Is she shaking?

83
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:21,919
Hm?

84
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:24,489
She's definitely shaking.

85
00:05:24,591 --> 00:05:27,119
- OK.
- - She's doing her pee dance.

86
00:05:27,143 --> 00:05:28,810
She does it when she has to pee.

87
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:31,057
OK, well, is she
gonna pee right now?

88
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:33,315
Hm...

89
00:05:33,417 --> 00:05:36,818
Oh, no, that's not the right...

90
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:42,941
OK.

91
00:05:44,127 --> 00:05:47,212
Beautiful. Um...

92
00:05:47,314 --> 00:05:49,514
In my third year as
a resident, I was...

93
00:05:49,616 --> 00:05:51,383
Can't hear you!

94
00:05:53,053 --> 00:05:57,371
In my third year as a resident,
I was presented with a patient

95
00:05:57,473 --> 00:06:00,508
named Sunder...

96
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:04,062
Atluri, a 28-year-old grad...

97
00:06:06,734 --> 00:06:08,733
student from India.

98
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:16,207
- Hey, I'm from ortho,
I was paged?
- You were paged by me.

99
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:18,960
Alex Karev, you have
to put me on this case.

100
00:06:19,062 --> 00:06:23,081
Here's a news flash, overly enthusiastic
intern guy, I don't have to do anything.

101
00:06:23,183 --> 00:06:26,284
- Come on, you seem
like a cool person.
- You don't know me.

102
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,653
You look like a cool
person. I need cool cases.

103
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:32,841
Ever since the elevator
thing and heart guy, it's just...

104
00:06:32,943 --> 00:06:34,642
Wait, that was you?

105
00:06:34,744 --> 00:06:37,061
You're the heart
in the elevator guy?

106
00:06:37,163 --> 00:06:39,814
Sure, let's go with that.

107
00:06:42,919 --> 00:06:44,359
You're not at all
how I pictured you.

108
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:46,655
- What's that supposed to mean?
- I heard the story.

109
00:06:46,757 --> 00:06:49,323
The heart in the elevator. It
was basically<i> Rudy,</i> you know?

110
00:06:49,425 --> 00:06:52,027
Dorky guy makes good. But
you're not dorky. You're hot.

111
00:06:52,129 --> 00:06:54,595
Maybe I was dorky before I
saved the cop in the elevator.

112
00:06:54,698 --> 00:06:58,432
Maybe my unbelievable skill under
pressure transformed me completely.

113
00:06:58,535 --> 00:07:01,469
- Hm. Did it?
- Does that turn you on?

114
00:07:05,475 --> 00:07:07,341
No, but this does.

115
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:26,877
Um...

116
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,680
Good... good morning.

117
00:07:30,517 --> 00:07:32,017
Once upon a time...

118
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:36,804
long before I was
chief of surgery...

119
00:07:36,907 --> 00:07:39,941
even before I was an attending,

120
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:42,694
I was a resident, right
here at Seattle Grace.

121
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:44,563
Just like you.

122
00:07:44,665 --> 00:07:48,266
You learn from everything
in your residency.

123
00:07:48,368 --> 00:07:53,738
The patients, the
nurses, the attendings.

124
00:07:53,823 --> 00:07:59,594
But you don't realize how
much you learn from each other.

125
00:07:59,696 --> 00:08:02,897
<i>1982. You all were in diapers.</i>

126
00:08:02,999 --> 00:08:05,967
- Give me the chart on 2314.
- - Yes, doctor.

127
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:08,803
So, Dr. Russell, I hear
you shot a 74 last week.

128
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:10,905
You should come to my
club when you have a day off.

129
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:13,452
I used to play there with your
father. We'll see if you measure up.

130
00:08:13,476 --> 00:08:15,777
- Oh, I'd love to, sir.
- Do we get any path back yet?

131
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:17,607
Nothing's grown
out of the cultures.

132
00:08:17,631 --> 00:08:20,514
I checked them this morning,
sir. I went to the lab myself.

133
00:08:20,616 --> 00:08:25,203
- So, Dr. Russell,
is he still febrile?
- Where is it?!

134
00:08:25,305 --> 00:08:27,238
Where's that damn crash cart?!

135
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,608
I was checking his wound when he
went into SVT with respiratory distress.

136
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:32,438
I can cardiovert him out of
it. Charge the paddles to 100.

137
00:08:32,462 --> 00:08:34,646
Charge paddles?
What's going on here?

138
00:08:34,748 --> 00:08:36,197
He's here for a hernia surgery!

139
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,260
- What's happening?
- This is no job for a nurse.

140
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:42,103
- I'll take it from here.
- You know I'm not a nurse. Back off.

141
00:08:42,205 --> 00:08:44,422
Clear!

142
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:52,997
<i>Dr. Ellis Grey.</i>

143
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:58,119
Two-time-Harper-Avery-Award-winner
and my colleague on this case.

144
00:08:59,189 --> 00:09:01,289
A case that changed my life.

145
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:04,125
Look around.

146
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:11,098
The biggest influences in your
life are sitting next to you right now.

147
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:19,707
- This is gonna
get more interesting.
- Yeah.

148
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:30,635
The late Dr. Ellis Grey was
known as a groundbreaker...

149
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,487
a lion.

150
00:09:32,589 --> 00:09:36,007
She was the best this hospital
or most hospitals have ever seen.

151
00:09:36,109 --> 00:09:40,228
But back then, she
was known as "sugar"...

152
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:43,164
or "nurse"...

153
00:09:43,266 --> 00:09:45,917
or nothing at all.

154
00:09:48,021 --> 00:09:51,156
This man came in for a simple
hernia repair, and he's getting sicker

155
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:54,909
instead of better. You people
better figure out why, and fast.

156
00:10:03,136 --> 00:10:06,304
- Guess it's just
you and me, kid.
- Surprise, surprise.

157
00:10:06,406 --> 00:10:08,556
Oh, crap!

158
00:10:08,658 --> 00:10:11,242
Come on. Oh, come on.

159
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:14,446
- Come on.
- Oh!

160
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:16,191
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Just talk!

161
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:21,252
- Hm?
- Just tell us what happened.

162
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:25,506
OK.

163
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:34,598
There was, uh, this patient.

164
00:10:35,685 --> 00:10:38,336
He wanted to get
his club foot fixed.

165
00:10:40,857 --> 00:10:42,790
But I had a different idea.

166
00:10:44,027 --> 00:10:46,494
You told him he could walk?

167
00:10:46,596 --> 00:10:50,731
Yes. I was in the Peace Corps! I've
seen polio, I've studied the procedures.

168
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:52,633
- You're privileged.
- Sir?

169
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:54,452
Your application, I remember it.

170
00:10:54,554 --> 00:10:58,123
I'm saying you grew up privileged
and that privilege made you arrogant.

171
00:10:58,225 --> 00:11:01,843
And arrogance in an unseasoned
surgeon is a very dangerous thing.

172
00:11:01,945 --> 00:11:05,846
Sir, I didn't make this
promise lightly. I can do this.

173
00:11:07,784 --> 00:11:12,086
Did you promise him you'll try,
or did you promise him he'll walk?

174
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:18,409
Arrogant.

175
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,512
Arrogant.

176
00:11:23,633 --> 00:11:27,685
All right, Dr. Torres.
You'll live and die on this.

177
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:29,971
This is your career
at Seattle Grace.

178
00:11:30,073 --> 00:11:32,457
<i>He's such an ass!</i>

179
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:35,143
Dr. Gracie didn't like your
infectious process idea,

180
00:11:35,245 --> 00:11:37,523
but I think that's what
it's got to be, right?

181
00:11:37,547 --> 00:11:39,664
Gracie wouldn't know
his ass from his finger.

182
00:11:39,766 --> 00:11:41,131
Is "ass" the word of the day?

183
00:11:41,217 --> 00:11:44,269
There was mild
hemolysis on his CBC.

184
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:47,304
Anemia? Rhabdo? Was
there any hematuria?

185
00:11:47,407 --> 00:11:49,385
No, but there was
some yeast in his urine.

186
00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:52,977
A contaminant. Maybe the
hemolysis was just a bad blood draw?

187
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,979
Every day?

188
00:11:55,082 --> 00:11:56,548
That doesn't seem right.

189
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:04,767
This hemolysis
thing is a red herring.

190
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:07,236
I feel it in my bones that we're
going down the wrong road.

191
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:09,694
You're right. I feel
it in my bones too.

192
00:12:09,796 --> 00:12:11,295
Get your mind out of the gutter.

193
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:15,077
How can I do that when
I'm tearing your clothes off?

194
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:20,671
Think of the possibilities for
post-op fever: wind, wound, water.

195
00:12:20,774 --> 00:12:25,476
Water! The yeast.
I think I got it!

196
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:31,149
<i>Single most important step
in the treatment process.</i>

197
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:33,368
- Anyone?
- Physical exam.

198
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:37,505
- No. No chocolate for you.
- Lab and radiology evaluation.

199
00:12:37,607 --> 00:12:40,625
Oh! Come on, people, now
you're embarrassing me.

200
00:12:40,727 --> 00:12:43,511
- Patient history.
- Thank you! Catch!

201
00:12:47,484 --> 00:12:52,203
There isn't much inflammation,
but there are a lot of gallstones.

202
00:12:52,305 --> 00:12:54,166
Dr. Baylow, what
causes gallstones?

203
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:58,259
- High fat diets
are a huge contributor.
- Yes, fatty foods and...?

204
00:12:58,361 --> 00:13:00,194
She's vegan.

205
00:13:00,296 --> 00:13:02,814
- Who's talking?
- I'm sorry, sir.

206
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:05,194
- Keep it down or get out of the OR.
- - She's vegan.

207
00:13:05,218 --> 00:13:07,268
- She is?
- Yeah.

208
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:10,888
She has had severe reflux most
of her life until she discovered,

209
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:13,807
when she was 15, that
a vegan diet helped.

210
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:16,360
Her ex-boyfriend,
who broke up with her

211
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:19,197
after her last surgery,
was a vegan chef.

212
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:23,734
Well, that's quite a history
you have there, doctor.

213
00:13:23,837 --> 00:13:27,205
Dr. Baylow, your intern
is doing a hell of a job.

214
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:32,276
Uh...

215
00:13:38,401 --> 00:13:41,052
Listen, you little moppet,
you hang me out to dry like that

216
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:42,954
in front of the chief
again, I will end you.

217
00:13:43,056 --> 00:13:46,374
Your career, your future, your
life. Do we understand each other?

218
00:13:46,476 --> 00:13:50,144
If it were up to me, you'd be
doing scut until your hair turns grey.

219
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:52,813
Oh, wait a minute.
It is up to me!

220
00:13:55,401 --> 00:14:00,655
We're not allowed to beat you with
sticks, so we punish you with scut.

221
00:14:02,658 --> 00:14:05,343
We do it today, and
they did it back in my day.

222
00:14:05,445 --> 00:14:08,879
- Dr. Grey
and I did mountains of scut.
- Mm-hm.

223
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:13,751
Testing tissue samples was
boring, but it's how we found out

224
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:17,021
our patient had a fungus
called cryptococcus.

225
00:14:17,123 --> 00:14:19,402
Have you traveled recently
to a tropical country?

226
00:14:19,426 --> 00:14:21,492
Like Taiwan? Or Argentina?

227
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:24,011
No. I've never even
been out of this country.

228
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:27,398
Do you live near a bird aviary?
Or are you around a lot of pigeons?

229
00:14:29,385 --> 00:14:32,019
- No.
- What kind
of questions are these?

230
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:35,022
<i>We asked his
girlfriend to step out...</i>

231
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:41,679
because we knew we were gonna have to
ask some pretty uncomfortable questions.

232
00:14:41,781 --> 00:14:46,900
We suspected he might have GRID.
Does anyone know what GRID is?

233
00:14:50,906 --> 00:14:52,940
- AIDS.
- That's right.

234
00:14:53,042 --> 00:14:57,862
- But in 1982 it was known as...
- Gay-related
immune deficiency?!

235
00:14:57,964 --> 00:15:01,132
You think I have sex with
men? Are you out of your minds?

236
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:02,394
What kind of doctors are you?

237
00:15:02,418 --> 00:15:04,196
- You're sick!
- Sir, just calm down.

238
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:06,548
We're not passing any judgment.
They're standard questions.

239
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:09,990
- Get this thing out of my arm!
- Sir, get back into bed.

240
00:15:10,092 --> 00:15:12,860
- You still need the antibiotics -
I'll get the antibiotics elsewhere.

241
00:15:12,962 --> 00:15:15,963
From real doctors. I did
not come here to be insulted.

242
00:15:16,065 --> 00:15:18,733
And don't think I won't talk
to your superiors about this.

243
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:28,159
This was early 1982.

244
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:32,529
We hadn't seen a case
in Washington State. Ever.

245
00:15:32,631 --> 00:15:35,232
San Francisco
only had five cases.

246
00:15:35,335 --> 00:15:39,536
We didn't know what it was, and because
it was isolated to the gay community,

247
00:15:39,638 --> 00:15:41,316
the government
wasn't funding research.

248
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:45,792
Does anyone know when the HIV
retrovirus was finally discovered?

249
00:15:45,895 --> 00:15:48,896
Uh, 1983, but there
wasn't a test for it until '85.

250
00:15:48,998 --> 00:15:54,052
That's right. It was so new even our
attending didn't know how to handle it.

251
00:15:54,154 --> 00:15:58,172
GRID? You accused a patient
in my hospital of having a disease

252
00:15:58,274 --> 00:16:00,469
that hasn't even been proven
to exist. What were you thinking?

253
00:16:00,493 --> 00:16:02,176
That patient wasn't even a gay!

254
00:16:02,278 --> 00:16:05,746
He's threatening to sue
us for slander. Good job.

255
00:16:05,848 --> 00:16:10,334
You're on probation.
Both of you.

256
00:16:22,182 --> 00:16:24,477
Patient's getting harder to
ventilate. Did you hear me?

257
00:16:24,501 --> 00:16:27,468
- I heard you! Shush.
- Did you shush me? Don't shush me.

258
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:30,487
- You need to start to wrap up.
- Wrap up? I just got started!

259
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:32,050
We've been working
for eight hours.

260
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:33,741
I'm trying to be meticulous,

261
00:16:33,843 --> 00:16:36,460
make sure I'm getting good
compression. I think it's gonna work.

262
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:38,023
- I'm pretty sure.
- "Pretty sure?"

263
00:16:39,816 --> 00:16:41,877
He's got pericarditis
and lung disease.

264
00:16:41,901 --> 00:16:45,486
He's getting unstable.

265
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:52,348
Dude. Do you want him to walk, or
do you want him to keep breathing?

266
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:57,215
Successes or failures,
which teaches you more?

267
00:16:57,317 --> 00:16:58,499
Failures!

268
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:00,918
Yeah, but that was a
gimme, don't get too cocky.

269
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:05,556
The patient was discharged, and a
month later she was back in the ER

270
00:17:05,658 --> 00:17:08,158
in the middle of the night.
Right lower quadrant pain,

271
00:17:08,261 --> 00:17:10,845
fever, vomiting...
Symptoms consistent with...?

272
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:13,313
Appendicitis!

273
00:17:13,415 --> 00:17:18,318
You get a chocolate 'cause that's
what I thought, but don't eat it yet.

274
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:19,903
Pay attention.

275
00:17:20,005 --> 00:17:23,473
<i>I diagnosed Alicia
with appendicitis,</i>

276
00:17:23,576 --> 00:17:29,730
<i>and Dr. Webber decided that appy
was going to be my first solo surgery.</i>

277
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:31,749
Mobilize the cecum.

278
00:17:31,851 --> 00:17:34,185
There you go.

279
00:17:34,287 --> 00:17:37,471
- Not bad, Dr. Bailey.
- Thank you, sir.

280
00:17:37,573 --> 00:17:39,752
I'm glad you decided to
come to Seattle Grace.

281
00:17:39,776 --> 00:17:43,594
You were a strong applicant.
People are excited to have you here.

282
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:56,807
Surgery's a shark
tank. Sharks have teeth.

283
00:17:56,893 --> 00:18:01,311
Make sure you're a shark
too. And not a minnow.

284
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:04,182
Sir, are you referring
to my height?

285
00:18:04,284 --> 00:18:07,869
No, I'm not. God made you short.

286
00:18:07,971 --> 00:18:09,770
Who made you quiet?

287
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:14,392
Um...

288
00:18:14,494 --> 00:18:17,444
That, unfortunately, is a
perfectly healthy appendix.

289
00:18:17,547 --> 00:18:19,580
- What?
- No infection. No inflammation.

290
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:23,851
The whole lower right
quadrant looks good.

291
00:18:23,953 --> 00:18:28,572
- Sir, I'm... I'm so sorry.
- Shake it off, shake it off.

292
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:32,187
If you never get a negative appy,
you're not doing enough appys.

293
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:34,731
That's just part of the process.

294
00:18:35,431 --> 00:18:36,671
All right. Let's take it out,

295
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:39,050
and we'll get ready to close.

296
00:18:42,805 --> 00:18:46,490
I didn't want to
close, but we had to.

297
00:18:47,092 --> 00:18:49,526
So...

298
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:54,331
We took the patient
to surgery again and...

299
00:18:55,201 --> 00:18:57,118
Wait, no...

300
00:18:59,088 --> 00:19:00,387
Hang on.

301
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:03,657
You were there. Help her.

302
00:19:05,861 --> 00:19:08,395
That's when we saw the
dude do the thing with his foot.

303
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:10,231
You know.

304
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:14,918
The surgery was more
difficult than I anticipated.

305
00:19:15,021 --> 00:19:19,857
I was able to do the tendon
release, but your lungs and heart

306
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:22,660
weren't able to withstand any
more time under anesthesia,

307
00:19:22,762 --> 00:19:26,213
so I couldn't do
any more than that.

308
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:31,752
I understand. When
do we start again?

309
00:19:33,072 --> 00:19:34,938
Sunder, I'm saying I...

310
00:19:35,608 --> 00:19:37,408
I think we don't.

311
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:40,777
Well...

312
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,580
Now, I don't understand.

313
00:19:49,222 --> 00:19:53,173
Look at this. Look at my foot.

314
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:55,042
Watch it.

315
00:19:58,548 --> 00:20:01,782
You did that for me.

316
00:20:01,884 --> 00:20:05,186
Since I was seven, I have
never been able to do that.

317
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:10,508
I've always been different.

318
00:20:12,245 --> 00:20:14,278
I've always been stared at.

319
00:20:16,398 --> 00:20:18,882
I want to walk.

320
00:20:18,984 --> 00:20:22,069
I want to stand straight up.

321
00:20:24,774 --> 00:20:26,974
I believe you can do the rest.

322
00:20:28,294 --> 00:20:29,877
Please.

323
00:20:32,381 --> 00:20:34,214
Please try.

324
00:20:36,769 --> 00:20:39,336
<i>No surgeon likes
giving up on a patient.</i>

325
00:20:39,438 --> 00:20:42,940
Dr. Grey and I liked
it even less than most.

326
00:20:43,026 --> 00:20:47,695
But when a patient refuses
treatment, you're done.

327
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:50,263
I mean, we were done.

328
00:20:51,984 --> 00:20:53,751
That's what we thought, anyhow.

329
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:57,555
I put in the NG tube, doctor.

330
00:20:57,657 --> 00:20:59,089
OK.

331
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:03,327
Dr. Grey. Looking
beautiful as usual.

332
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:06,714
Flattery will get you to an on-call
room in five minutes or less.

333
00:21:06,816 --> 00:21:10,434
- You're on.
- Mommy! Mommy, look!

334
00:21:14,891 --> 00:21:16,423
That's supposed to
be for her birthday.

335
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:19,576
She was crying. She misses you.

336
00:21:20,763 --> 00:21:22,145
And I got desperate.

337
00:21:23,266 --> 00:21:26,666
- Richard.
- Thatcher. How are you?

338
00:21:29,372 --> 00:21:31,672
I only have a few
seconds. Show me your doll.

339
00:21:31,774 --> 00:21:35,041
<i>Dr. Grey, Dr. Webber,
stat to Emergency.</i>

340
00:21:35,143 --> 00:21:37,861
- I gotta go, Thatch.
- Mommy, don't go!

341
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:40,283
Take her. Thatcher,
I have to go!

342
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:43,266
- Meredith.
- Mommy, no!

343
00:21:44,102 --> 00:21:47,471
Mommy? Don't go.

344
00:21:47,573 --> 00:21:50,824
<i>Dr. Grey, Dr. Webber,
stat to the ER.</i>

345
00:21:56,665 --> 00:21:58,349
Kaposi's sarcoma.

346
00:21:58,451 --> 00:22:01,268
Your GRID patient
from a few months back.

347
00:22:02,288 --> 00:22:04,004
Handle it!

348
00:22:18,203 --> 00:22:23,541
I'm sorry I... You were right,
you were right about everything.

349
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,842
Please.

350
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:29,229
Please.

351
00:22:29,331 --> 00:22:30,480
Help me.

352
00:22:37,222 --> 00:22:39,456
A healthy appendix.

353
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:44,778
The third surgery for this patient
with unrelenting abdominal pain,

354
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,047
fatigue and muscle
pain. Now what?

355
00:22:47,149 --> 00:22:49,266
Test for zebras,
uncommon diseases.

356
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:51,802
- OK.
- Do an ANA for lupus.

357
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:54,499
- Lupus, yeah.
- What about lead? You test for lead?

358
00:22:54,523 --> 00:22:58,892
Good, good. See,
sometimes it's not easy.

359
00:22:58,994 --> 00:23:04,297
Sometimes you have to be your patient's
advocate and push to get things done.

360
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:09,536
Excuse me, uh, Dr. Baylow,

361
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:13,235
Alicia Tatum is being discharged with
nothing but a note for a psych consult?

362
00:23:13,259 --> 00:23:15,793
She's sniffing around for
pain meds. She's depressed.

363
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:19,913
Well, yeah, months of severe
untreated pain can be... depressing.

364
00:23:20,015 --> 00:23:22,182
- OK, smarty pants.
- I just thought maybe

365
00:23:22,284 --> 00:23:27,253
we could test for lupus or lead
poisoning or even hemochromatosis...

366
00:23:27,356 --> 00:23:29,623
We're not ordering
thousands of dollars in tests

367
00:23:29,725 --> 00:23:32,876
for something that could be
cured with a big dose of Prozac.

368
00:23:32,978 --> 00:23:35,490
- But...
- What are we doing with Alicia Tatum?

369
00:23:35,514 --> 00:23:37,276
Turfing her to
psych for depression.

370
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:40,112
Cut her open three times and didn't
cure her pain. Wouldn't you be depressed?

371
00:23:40,136 --> 00:23:44,004
Of course. Before she goes I
thought we could test for lupus

372
00:23:44,106 --> 00:23:46,790
or lead poisoning or
maybe hemochromatosis.

373
00:23:46,892 --> 00:23:49,392
Hemochromatosis?
Now you're thinking.

374
00:23:49,495 --> 00:23:51,629
Good work.

375
00:23:51,731 --> 00:23:54,347
Oh, my God, I think
that's an intussusception.

376
00:23:54,449 --> 00:23:56,428
I've never seen one
before in an adult.

377
00:23:56,452 --> 00:23:59,803
Well, I suppose we'd handle it
the same way as with a kid, right?

378
00:23:59,889 --> 00:24:02,640
Dr. Gracie? What would
you do in this situation?

379
00:24:02,742 --> 00:24:04,558
Quite frankly, nothing.
I wouldn't operate.

380
00:24:07,212 --> 00:24:10,547
This patient's a lost
cause. He's got GRID.

381
00:24:10,649 --> 00:24:14,451
It's called AIDS now.

382
00:24:14,553 --> 00:24:18,956
AIDS. No one knows what's
causing it or how it spreads.

383
00:24:19,058 --> 00:24:21,792
You want me to risk the health
of my staff, my own life, for a guy

384
00:24:21,894 --> 00:24:24,311
with a death sentence?
No. I'm not doing it.

385
00:24:24,413 --> 00:24:25,979
I recommend you
don't do it either.

386
00:24:26,081 --> 00:24:30,050
We took an oath. We're
supposed to be healers.

387
00:24:30,152 --> 00:24:33,970
Ten years ago you wouldn't even
have been allowed in this program.

388
00:24:34,072 --> 00:24:36,606
Don't you dare tell me
what kind of oath we take.

389
00:24:41,997 --> 00:24:43,364
<i>We'd hit a wall.</i>

390
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:46,133
And, um...

391
00:24:46,235 --> 00:24:49,269
We planned a
number of procedures.

392
00:24:49,371 --> 00:24:52,089
But, um, uh, then...

393
00:24:52,191 --> 00:24:54,491
Then I gave you
that rousing pep talk.

394
00:24:55,795 --> 00:24:58,662
You know what? He totally did.

395
00:24:58,764 --> 00:25:02,265
What if I had quit in the
elevator? What if I had frozen?

396
00:25:02,368 --> 00:25:04,248
I had every reason
to freeze, I'm an intern.

397
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:05,864
I never had my hand
in a heart before.

398
00:25:05,888 --> 00:25:07,999
No reason for me to think
I'm not gonna do anything

399
00:25:08,023 --> 00:25:09,334
but kill that cop faster.

400
00:25:09,358 --> 00:25:11,175
- But you didn't.
- No. I didn't.

401
00:25:11,276 --> 00:25:14,778
I cut him open, I cross clamped
the aorta, stuck my finger in the hole

402
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,230
and I stopped the bleeding.

403
00:25:16,332 --> 00:25:19,182
It was seamless. I was perfect.

404
00:25:19,284 --> 00:25:22,302
So pretend there's a blackout,
you're stuck in an elevator,

405
00:25:22,404 --> 00:25:25,701
and your guy's bleeding out. What are
you gonna do? Are you gonna just quit?

406
00:25:25,725 --> 00:25:28,942
What was the result? Did she
test positive for hemochromatosis?

407
00:25:29,044 --> 00:25:31,078
- Nope.
- What about Lyme disease?

408
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:35,715
Lyme disease, negative.
Celiac disease, negative.

409
00:25:35,817 --> 00:25:37,951
Every test I could
think of, negative.

410
00:25:38,053 --> 00:25:41,121
So I did what I've told you
all to do when you get stuck.

411
00:25:41,223 --> 00:25:44,341
I went to the library,
and I hit the books.

412
00:25:45,077 --> 00:25:46,493
I hit 'em hard.

413
00:25:46,595 --> 00:25:50,264
I was raised to be
polite, you know.

414
00:25:50,365 --> 00:25:52,382
Don't raise your voice.

415
00:25:52,484 --> 00:25:57,037
Have respect for people
higher on the pecking order,

416
00:25:57,139 --> 00:26:01,375
be generous to those below...
I was not raised to be a shark!

417
00:26:01,477 --> 00:26:04,378
Does that make me a
minnow? Am I a minnow?

418
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,532
- I really don't know.
- I'm a minnow.

419
00:26:08,634 --> 00:26:14,488
And not because of my height.
Because I'm a minnow on the inside.

420
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:20,994
This is a sad
state of affairs, Joe.

421
00:26:25,234 --> 00:26:27,701
<i>Hell, we weren't noble.</i>

422
00:26:27,803 --> 00:26:30,821
We were just more
arrogant than the rest.

423
00:26:31,507 --> 00:26:33,340
And had more to prove.

424
00:26:33,442 --> 00:26:37,111
Your CT showed that your
bowel has twisted in on itself,

425
00:26:37,213 --> 00:26:39,480
probably because of Kaposi's
lesions in your abdomen.

426
00:26:39,581 --> 00:26:43,334
It's a pretty rare problem but
we can take care of it with surgery.

427
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:46,453
Will Dr. Gracie be
doing the surgery?

428
00:26:48,257 --> 00:26:50,538
I'm afraid you're stuck with us.

429
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:56,613
He's scared, isn't he?

430
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:01,201
Just like them, outside.

431
00:27:02,438 --> 00:27:03,570
I can see them...

432
00:27:05,741 --> 00:27:08,692
pointing, mumbling, staring.

433
00:27:08,794 --> 00:27:10,627
Screw them.

434
00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:21,138
I don't blame them...
for being scared.

435
00:27:24,109 --> 00:27:26,109
I'm scared too.

436
00:27:27,713 --> 00:27:33,901
I used to be scared that people
would find out that I was gay, and...

437
00:27:36,572 --> 00:27:39,907
Now I can't even
hide it anymore.

438
00:27:45,347 --> 00:27:47,597
I'm a leper...

439
00:27:47,699 --> 00:27:52,135
an outcast, an untouchable.

440
00:27:53,305 --> 00:27:55,205
No one will look at me.

441
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:00,644
No... No one will touch me.

442
00:28:03,299 --> 00:28:07,284
And I want to hate everyone
for treating me this way.

443
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:10,554
But how... how can I hate them

444
00:28:10,656 --> 00:28:13,490
for being scared when I'm
the one that's been living a lie?

445
00:28:17,262 --> 00:28:21,047
This is your chance to
change that. Have this surgery.

446
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:24,467
- Let us operate.
- What's the point?

447
00:28:25,504 --> 00:28:27,337
No one recovers from this.

448
00:28:29,608 --> 00:28:31,520
- No one lives.
- For all you know,

449
00:28:31,544 --> 00:28:35,429
there could be a cure for this
thing tomorrow, or next week.

450
00:28:35,531 --> 00:28:38,248
Let us operate.

451
00:28:41,487 --> 00:28:45,405
We spent days trying to make
things right, trying to figure out

452
00:28:45,507 --> 00:28:46,823
the best strategy.

453
00:28:46,925 --> 00:28:49,159
So we researched.

454
00:28:49,261 --> 00:28:53,713
And, uh, practiced
and practiced and...

455
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:55,382
eventually, we were ready.

456
00:28:55,484 --> 00:28:59,553
- Retract the rectus femoris.
- - What about the nerve?

457
00:28:59,655 --> 00:29:02,300
BP just dropped, and he's
tachycardic! Torsades on the monitor!

458
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:03,885
Oh, my God.
Pericardial tamponade?

459
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:05,275
Sounds like.

460
00:29:05,377 --> 00:29:08,228
Damn it. OK, nobody
panic. Page cardio.

461
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:11,848
Alex, we need to do a
subxiphoid pericardiotomy

462
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:13,867
to drain the blood
squeezing the heart.

463
00:29:13,969 --> 00:29:15,647
It's a version of what
you did in the elevator.

464
00:29:15,671 --> 00:29:19,022
- So get a scalpel...
- I can't.

465
00:29:19,124 --> 00:29:22,408
What do you mean, you can't?
You already did. Take the scalpel.

466
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:24,773
- I can't.
- The patient is crashing, Karev!

467
00:29:24,797 --> 00:29:26,908
- Do the elevator thing!
- I can't! I've never done this!

468
00:29:26,932 --> 00:29:31,551
It wasn't me! I'm not the heart in
the elevator guy! It was O'Malley!

469
00:29:36,942 --> 00:29:38,675
OK.

470
00:29:38,778 --> 00:29:40,177
OK.

471
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:42,779
No. This is fine. We're fine.

472
00:29:42,881 --> 00:29:46,199
- And you. You're doing this.
- But I haven't...

473
00:29:46,301 --> 00:29:49,920
Because you haven't doesn't
mean you can't. Take the scalpel!

474
00:29:58,597 --> 00:30:02,148
OK. Uh...

475
00:30:02,251 --> 00:30:05,985
Make a six-centimeter-long
incision...

476
00:30:06,088 --> 00:30:09,973
over the xiphisternal junction.

477
00:30:10,075 --> 00:30:11,725
Good.

478
00:30:13,495 --> 00:30:15,745
<i>We knew what we
were doing was risky.</i>

479
00:30:15,847 --> 00:30:18,315
These days, we know
that AIDS transmission

480
00:30:18,417 --> 00:30:22,085
requires the exchanges of bodily
fluids. But back then, we had no idea.

481
00:30:22,187 --> 00:30:26,539
Can you get it get it from casual
contact? From the air? From surgery?

482
00:30:27,475 --> 00:30:28,909
No idea.

483
00:30:30,612 --> 00:30:33,146
Poor guy, living
a lie for so long.

484
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:35,115
Yeah. Shame.

485
00:30:37,253 --> 00:30:38,885
We're living a lie too.

486
00:30:39,988 --> 00:30:41,449
- What?
- We shouldn't be doing

487
00:30:41,473 --> 00:30:43,985
- what we're doing. We have to stop.
- No.

488
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:47,477
We're not the lie. Our
marriages are the lie.

489
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:52,966
This, us... this
is what's right.

490
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:59,105
We should leave them, Richard.
You leave Adele and I'll leave Thatcher.

491
00:30:59,207 --> 00:31:02,476
I can't. You have
a daughter. I can't.

492
00:31:02,578 --> 00:31:04,794
And neither can you.

493
00:31:06,899 --> 00:31:09,583
You don't have to go in
there, I can do this alone.

494
00:31:09,685 --> 00:31:10,946
You have Meredith
to think about.

495
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:12,948
You're just like
the rest of them.

496
00:31:12,972 --> 00:31:15,405
You have a different skin
color, but you're just like them.

497
00:31:15,507 --> 00:31:18,341
- Ellis...
- I gave birth
to a child, Richard.

498
00:31:18,443 --> 00:31:20,843
That makes me a mother,
it doesn't make me inept,

499
00:31:20,946 --> 00:31:24,714
it doesn't make me less of a woman,
it doesn't make me less of a surgeon.

500
00:31:24,816 --> 00:31:27,583
No matter how much
everyone wants it to.

501
00:31:33,458 --> 00:31:38,594
All my research didn't help.
Dr. Baylow sent the patient home.

502
00:31:38,696 --> 00:31:42,449
So I thought she'd won. I thought
maybe I wasn't cut out for this game.

503
00:31:42,551 --> 00:31:44,867
But a couple months later...

504
00:31:46,455 --> 00:31:48,655
Alicia?

505
00:31:48,757 --> 00:31:51,591
- Thank God, a familiar face.
- What happened?

506
00:31:51,694 --> 00:31:54,344
The pain got really bad.

507
00:31:54,446 --> 00:31:57,664
They said maybe I have
some sort of obstruction

508
00:31:57,766 --> 00:32:00,767
or something from the other
surgeries. They want to go back in

509
00:32:00,869 --> 00:32:03,186
and take another look.

510
00:32:06,024 --> 00:32:09,426
Mandy, I don't think
I can take it anymore.

511
00:32:09,528 --> 00:32:13,080
Please tell me this
surgery's gonna help.

512
00:32:13,182 --> 00:32:14,998
They're gonna find
something, right?

513
00:32:20,238 --> 00:32:22,723
Oh! Don't touch her!

514
00:32:22,825 --> 00:32:26,609
I know you're here to
take her to the OR but...

515
00:32:26,711 --> 00:32:28,628
Don't touch her.

516
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:33,349
So you canceled your resident's
surgery. Isn't that a little bold?

517
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:36,519
She was worried about
adhesions, right? Gimme candy!

518
00:32:36,605 --> 00:32:38,621
No adhesions. No candy.

519
00:32:38,723 --> 00:32:41,458
And it wasn't bold,
Grey, it was stupid.

520
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:45,712
But in this case, it
was also necessary.

521
00:32:47,149 --> 00:32:50,149
Where do you get off
canceling my surgery?

522
00:32:50,252 --> 00:32:52,252
- When I...
- You work for me, got that?

523
00:32:52,354 --> 00:32:55,838
You listen to what I have
to say. Are you at all familiar

524
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:59,376
with what surgeons
do, Dr. Bailey? We cut.

525
00:32:59,478 --> 00:33:01,505
Yeah, rebook Ms.
Tatum for surgery.

526
00:33:01,529 --> 00:33:06,466
Dr. Baylow, you wanted to go
in and explore her obstruction?

527
00:33:06,568 --> 00:33:08,768
She doesn't have
any signs of adhesions!

528
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:10,970
Just because she's
had previous surgeries

529
00:33:11,073 --> 00:33:14,123
doesn't mean you shouldn't
actually look for another cause.

530
00:33:14,226 --> 00:33:18,395
She has a pseudo-obstruction
that can be resolved with an NG tube.

531
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:23,250
And if you'd looked further and, I
don't know, talked to your patient,

532
00:33:23,351 --> 00:33:26,119
you would have discovered
that, along with abdominal pain,

533
00:33:26,221 --> 00:33:30,023
she also had weakness,
palpitations, numbness, skin changes,

534
00:33:30,125 --> 00:33:33,893
and her urine is intermittently
dark. Ringing any bells yet?

535
00:33:35,247 --> 00:33:38,331
Your patient, who's been
sliced nine ways to Sunday,

536
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:42,452
has porphyria. If you
had diagnosed it earlier,

537
00:33:42,554 --> 00:33:45,455
she could have avoided
getting her ovaries taken out.

538
00:33:45,557 --> 00:33:49,810
And her gallbladder. And yes,
yes, I took out her appendix.

539
00:33:49,912 --> 00:33:53,346
I, too, am at fault for not
looking at the whole person.

540
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:57,417
But you know the difference between
you and me? I learned something from it.

541
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:00,987
I learned when not to cut. I
learned to listen to my patient.

542
00:34:01,089 --> 00:34:04,090
How could you have
not learned in three years

543
00:34:04,192 --> 00:34:06,888
- what it took me
three months to learn?
- Dr. Bailey.

544
00:34:06,912 --> 00:34:10,730
And the reason I had her chart
was because you ignored my pages

545
00:34:10,832 --> 00:34:13,099
and she needs to get
started on hemin right away.

546
00:34:13,201 --> 00:34:16,852
You put it in her IV. You
give it daily for four days...

547
00:34:16,955 --> 00:34:19,105
- Dr. Bailey...
- The patient gets better.

548
00:34:19,207 --> 00:34:23,059
The patient doesn't get prodded,
probed, scoped or cut open

549
00:34:23,161 --> 00:34:27,213
- like a Thanksgiving turkey,
you supercilious fool!
- Dr. Bailey!

550
00:34:28,984 --> 00:34:32,519
My office. Now!

551
00:34:40,312 --> 00:34:43,780
We did a series of shorter
surgeries so his lungs and heart

552
00:34:43,882 --> 00:34:46,716
could withstand the anesthesia.
It was grueling for the patient

553
00:34:46,819 --> 00:34:49,752
- but worth it in the end.
- Show them the X-rays.

554
00:34:49,854 --> 00:34:52,055
Oh, yeah, so cool.

555
00:34:52,157 --> 00:34:53,623
OK. Um...

556
00:34:54,475 --> 00:34:57,143
These are the before.

557
00:34:58,196 --> 00:35:01,264
And these are the after.

558
00:35:03,635 --> 00:35:05,051
Wow, yeah.

559
00:35:11,593 --> 00:35:14,194
Yeah, it was... It was amazing.

560
00:35:14,295 --> 00:35:16,896
I mean, after the final
surgery, we were just...

561
00:35:17,015 --> 00:35:22,119
We celebrated that night.
Man, did we ever celebrate.

562
00:35:30,562 --> 00:35:34,764
- Mm! Wait, cone of silence.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Whatever.

563
00:35:43,225 --> 00:35:46,042
<i>I knew I was in big trouble.</i>

564
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:49,846
It is my job to make
sure that my residents

565
00:35:49,948 --> 00:35:52,231
are supported and
treated with respect.

566
00:35:52,333 --> 00:35:53,916
Of course, and I am so sorry...

567
00:35:54,019 --> 00:35:56,080
You have said
enough for one day.

568
00:35:56,104 --> 00:35:59,606
- Sorry.
- It's my job.

569
00:35:59,708 --> 00:36:04,027
So we're gonna sit here with you
wearing that terrified look on your face

570
00:36:04,129 --> 00:36:08,064
for a respectable amount of
time, so Dr. Baylow and her friends

571
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:11,606
can assume you've had your
behind handed to you on a platter.

572
00:36:17,209 --> 00:36:19,859
You're gonna make a hell
of a surgeon, Dr. Bailey.

573
00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:24,480
Lose the smile.

574
00:36:24,582 --> 00:36:27,567
The patient survived the
surgery, but eight months later

575
00:36:27,669 --> 00:36:30,069
he came back with PCP pneumonia.

576
00:36:33,875 --> 00:36:36,076
He died a week later.

577
00:36:37,579 --> 00:36:39,779
Dr. Grey and I, well...

578
00:36:39,881 --> 00:36:42,815
Well, um, I won't speak for her.

579
00:36:42,917 --> 00:36:46,970
But I lost the sense
that I was a superhero.

580
00:36:48,273 --> 00:36:52,575
And I really started to think
of how dangerous it all was.

581
00:36:54,095 --> 00:36:57,096
It changes you. This work.

582
00:36:58,266 --> 00:37:01,801
Your patients. Your colleagues.

583
00:37:01,903 --> 00:37:03,636
You change each other.

584
00:37:05,039 --> 00:37:07,990
You don't ever think
you'll lose your way...

585
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:12,328
but what happens
in this hospital...

586
00:37:14,316 --> 00:37:16,716
just remember why you came here.

587
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:21,638
You said it the day you
graduated from med school.

588
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:24,641
You took the physician's oath.

589
00:37:25,761 --> 00:37:28,161
Remember it.

590
00:37:28,263 --> 00:37:31,798
Tape it to your locker.
To your bathroom mirror.

591
00:37:33,552 --> 00:37:36,486
'Cause it is too easy
to lose your way.

592
00:37:45,597 --> 00:37:51,200
I solemnly pledge to consecrate
my life to the service of humanity.

593
00:37:54,071 --> 00:37:57,106
I will give to my teachers...

594
00:37:57,208 --> 00:38:00,426
the respect and
gratitude that is their due.

595
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:04,363
I will practice my profession...

596
00:38:04,465 --> 00:38:09,419
with conscience and dignity.

597
00:38:09,521 --> 00:38:15,825
The health of my patients will
be my number one consideration.

598
00:38:15,927 --> 00:38:19,729
I will respect the secrets
that are confided in me...

599
00:38:20,782 --> 00:38:23,516
even after my patient has died.

600
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:31,524
<i>I will maintain by all
the means in my power...</i>

601
00:38:31,626 --> 00:38:36,362
<i>the honor and the noble
traditions of the medical profession.</i>

602
00:38:42,937 --> 00:38:47,039
<i>My colleagues will be
my sisters and brothers.</i>

603
00:38:54,466 --> 00:38:58,635
<i>I will not permit
considerations of age,</i>

604
00:38:58,736 --> 00:39:02,822
<i>disease or disability, creed...</i>

605
00:39:02,924 --> 00:39:07,510
<i>Ethnic origin, gender...</i>

606
00:39:07,612 --> 00:39:12,632
<i>race, political affiliation...</i>

607
00:39:12,734 --> 00:39:17,237
<i>nationality, sexual
orientation...</i>

608
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:21,007
<i>social standing...</i>

609
00:39:23,077 --> 00:39:27,480
<i>or any other factor to
intervene between my duty...</i>

610
00:39:31,803 --> 00:39:33,670
<i>and my patient.</i>

611
00:39:40,311 --> 00:39:44,547
I will maintain the utmost
respect for human life.

612
00:39:44,649 --> 00:39:48,017
I will not use my medical
knowledge to violate human rights

613
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:50,353
and civil liberties...

614
00:39:50,455 --> 00:39:51,887
even under threat.

615
00:39:51,989 --> 00:39:57,226
I make these promises
solemnly, freely...

616
00:39:58,346 --> 00:40:00,313
and upon my honor.

617
00:40:48,496 --> 00:40:49,974
The job offer still stands.

618
00:40:49,998 --> 00:40:53,799
Think about it...
and let me know.

619
00:41:02,594 --> 00:41:04,494
We'll see.

620
00:41:11,636 --> 00:41:13,903
To Philip.

621
00:41:14,005 --> 00:41:16,305
May he rest in peace.

622
00:41:16,407 --> 00:41:20,409
You can't toast a dead Irishman
with a soda pop, Richard.

623
00:41:20,511 --> 00:41:24,948
- Get this man a vodka, Frankie.
- Oh, yeah. Coming right up.

624
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:27,261
You know I can't stand
the taste of that stuff.

625
00:41:27,285 --> 00:41:29,785
It's time to learn.

626
00:41:29,888 --> 00:41:34,040
You're a grown-up,
Richard. It's time to act like it.

627
00:41:40,999 --> 00:41:42,665
I can't leave her, Ellis.

628
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:47,420
I can't.

629
00:41:49,157 --> 00:41:50,356
We'll see.
