1
00:00:07,641 --> 00:00:11,059
<i>Doctors live in a world
of constant progress...</i>

2
00:00:12,362 --> 00:00:14,963
<i>and forward motion.</i>

3
00:00:15,065 --> 00:00:17,099
<i>Stand still for a second...</i>

4
00:00:17,201 --> 00:00:18,883
<i>and you'll be left behind.</i>

5
00:00:20,954 --> 00:00:23,722
<i>But as hard as we
try to move forward,</i>

6
00:00:23,824 --> 00:00:28,409
<i>as tempting as it is
to never look back...</i>

7
00:00:28,512 --> 00:00:32,130
<i>the past always comes
back to bite us in the ass.</i>

8
00:00:32,233 --> 00:00:33,782
Meredith! Hey.

9
00:00:33,884 --> 00:00:37,352
- Thanks for meeting me here.
- Are you OK? Where have
you been?

10
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:39,699
I'm fine. I've been in
Chehalis with my mom.

11
00:00:39,723 --> 00:00:41,951
This is not Chehalis.
Where the hell are we?

12
00:00:41,975 --> 00:00:45,461
We're in Seattle, Dr. Singer.
This is Dr. Grey, my friend.

13
00:00:45,563 --> 00:00:48,096
This is Dr. Singer. He was
my high school science teacher.

14
00:00:48,198 --> 00:00:51,850
A brilliant man. He fought for me.
He's the reason I became a surgeon.

15
00:00:51,952 --> 00:00:54,603
I appreciate your taking
the time to see us, Dr. Grey,

16
00:00:54,705 --> 00:00:58,424
but I promised Isobel's Algebra II
teacher I'd have her back in time

17
00:00:58,526 --> 00:01:00,308
- for fifth period.
- I'm confused.

18
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:03,077
So is he. Nursing home
diagnosed him with Alzheimer's,

19
00:01:03,179 --> 00:01:05,364
but he's been falling.
He could have a bleed.

20
00:01:05,466 --> 00:01:07,849
He's wearing pajamas and
an overcoat. What'd you do,

21
00:01:07,951 --> 00:01:09,434
- sneak him out in the night?
- No.

22
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,352
- This morning.
- You kidnapped him?

23
00:01:11,454 --> 00:01:14,139
Can you please just
sneak him in to see Derek?

24
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:18,126
- Put him
on the schedule? Please?
- You've been in Chehalis,

25
00:01:18,228 --> 00:01:21,630
and the only reason you came
back is to bring a confused, sickly man

26
00:01:21,731 --> 00:01:24,232
- for Derek to look at?
- Yes.

27
00:01:24,335 --> 00:01:27,285
- Ow! Ow! Stop hitting me!
- We were worried about you!

28
00:01:27,387 --> 00:01:29,587
- I was worried about you!
- Look, please,

29
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:33,659
can you get him in to see Derek?
I'll be back later. I'll be back, OK?

30
00:01:33,761 --> 00:01:35,828
- No. You cannot leave him here.
- I'm not going in.

31
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:39,114
- You need to let Alex
know you're OK.
- I am not going in there.

32
00:01:39,216 --> 00:01:41,382
Yes, you're going in. So he
got you pregnant, so what?

33
00:01:41,484 --> 00:01:44,204
- You're pregnant?
- No. He thinks
I'm 15 years old.

34
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:46,533
- Right.
- You're gonna go
into that school

35
00:01:46,557 --> 00:01:49,891
and show those cheerleaders that
you have nothing to be ashamed of.

36
00:01:49,993 --> 00:01:52,010
Those little bitches
are poisonous.

37
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:54,763
<i>And as history shows
us again and again,</i>

38
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:59,334
<i>those who forget the past
are doomed to repeat it.</i>

39
00:02:00,271 --> 00:02:01,904
Cristina.

40
00:02:02,006 --> 00:02:04,272
- Dr. Yang.
- Dr. Avery.

41
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:06,725
- Look, OK, about the kiss...
- Kiss? What kiss?

42
00:02:06,827 --> 00:02:08,827
There was no kiss.

43
00:02:08,912 --> 00:02:11,613
I don't know what
you're talking about.

44
00:02:14,585 --> 00:02:17,085
- So do you have a boyfriend...?
- Never gonna happen.

45
00:02:17,187 --> 00:02:20,221
Got it. Thanks.

46
00:02:20,323 --> 00:02:23,625
- Hey. You paged us?
- I paged you. One second, Dr. Avery.

47
00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:28,262
Um, I know you think I don't
understand you. So I got you a present.

48
00:02:28,364 --> 00:02:31,266
Come on. Come on, I don't
wanna lose him! What do we got?

49
00:02:31,368 --> 00:02:35,153
Defib paddles!

50
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:38,135
- You got me a cardiac trauma!
- - I didn't just get you a trauma.

51
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:39,641
I got you a Cardio god.

52
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:43,478
- Or goddess.
- Saline! Lock and load to 50!

53
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,363
Clear!

54
00:02:47,568 --> 00:02:51,085
Nothing! Come on. Come on!

55
00:02:58,328 --> 00:03:00,445
Nice to meet you. Jackson Avery.

56
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:02,430
- Teddy Altman.
- Teddy Altman?

57
00:03:02,532 --> 00:03:04,416
I've... I've never heard of you.

58
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:08,320
Cristina Yang? I've never heard
of you either. That makes us even.

59
00:03:08,422 --> 00:03:11,006
Teddy and I, we
served in Iraq together,

60
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:14,359
and she's gonna be
joining us for a little while.

61
00:03:14,461 --> 00:03:16,628
OK. Come on, I'll
introduce you to the chief.

62
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:18,846
- Great. You look good.
- Thanks.

63
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:20,932
- You put on a little weight.
- I have not.

64
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:23,751
- Have too!
- Who the hell is she?

65
00:03:23,854 --> 00:03:28,172
Go to the PACU and write the
post-op note on Mrs. Murdoch. Thanks.

66
00:03:28,275 --> 00:03:30,515
Want me to page you if
there are complications?

67
00:03:30,611 --> 00:03:31,910
Yes.

68
00:03:32,012 --> 00:03:34,095
- Miranda, there you are!
- Adele?

69
00:03:34,215 --> 00:03:37,249
You all right? Is everything OK?

70
00:03:37,351 --> 00:03:39,834
Richard didn't come home
last night, and didn't call.

71
00:03:39,936 --> 00:03:43,689
Tell me he's not lying
somewhere in a ditch, dead.

72
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:47,542
The last time I saw him
was... last night, in his office,

73
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:50,345
- working on the budget.
- Why didn't he answer his pager

74
00:03:50,447 --> 00:03:53,331
- or his cell phone?
- OK, hold on. Hold on.

75
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:57,969
And why doesn't anybody in this hospital
know where the chief of surgery is?

76
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,671
Dr. Bailey, have
you seen the chief?

77
00:03:59,773 --> 00:04:02,073
One of his patients
needs an emergency chole.

78
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:04,142
OK, I'm on it. Uh...

79
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:09,114
You go ahead and prep the patient.
You get yourself a cup of coffee. Decaf.

80
00:04:09,216 --> 00:04:11,583
I will find the chief.

81
00:04:13,903 --> 00:04:17,338
- So you're
an evolutionary biologist?
- Mmm, I was.

82
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,510
I was part of a research team on
my way to the GalÃ¡pagos Islands,

83
00:04:21,612 --> 00:04:26,715
and, suddenly, my father died.
And, of course, I had to go home.

84
00:04:26,817 --> 00:04:31,186
Next thing I know, I'm back in Chehalis,
marrying my high school sweetheart

85
00:04:31,288 --> 00:04:34,706
and teaching biology to kids who
would rather be anywhere else.

86
00:04:34,808 --> 00:04:40,028
- I hear you're
an excellent teacher.
- Isobel's an excellent student.

87
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:42,648
She's gonna be a
doctor herself some day.

88
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:46,385
If she doesn't
get too distracted.

89
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,320
Hmm.

90
00:04:48,422 --> 00:04:50,889
Well, everything
looks good, Dr. Singer.

91
00:04:50,991 --> 00:04:53,892
- What we're gonna do is
take some blood - Ouch.

92
00:04:53,994 --> 00:04:56,762
- And run some tests. OK?
- OK.

93
00:04:56,863 --> 00:04:58,797
All right. Stevens?

94
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,766
How long has he been like this?

95
00:05:01,869 --> 00:05:04,068
Um, I talked to him at
Christmas and he was fine.

96
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:07,290
He was still teaching. The school
only let him go six months ago.

97
00:05:07,323 --> 00:05:09,283
- Is he on any medication?
- Every medication.

98
00:05:09,343 --> 00:05:11,926
Alzheimer's meds, Parkinson's
meds, anti-depressants.

99
00:05:12,028 --> 00:05:14,123
- What was his diagnosis?
- Dementia. The guy was useless.

100
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,798
- He might as well
have said old age.
- Possible.

101
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,550
He's 67. And if he
fell and hit his head,

102
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:21,085
he could have an intracranial
bleed, no one would know.

103
00:05:21,188 --> 00:05:23,333
- Hmm.
- His wife is dead,
he has no kids...

104
00:05:23,357 --> 00:05:25,507
Where have you been? You
missed your IL-2 appointment.

105
00:05:25,609 --> 00:05:28,626
You told Cristina I was
here? Who else did you tell?

106
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:31,212
Well, well, well.
Look who's back.

107
00:05:31,314 --> 00:05:33,949
This guy? You told the
guy that got me fired?

108
00:05:34,051 --> 00:05:36,717
I didn't tell him. I don't know
him. It's my first day back.

109
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,653
Dr. Percy is on
my service today.

110
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:42,257
And I didn't get you fired.
You did that all by yourself.

111
00:05:42,359 --> 00:05:45,109
Dr. Percy, Dr. Singer needs
a full dementia work up.

112
00:05:45,211 --> 00:05:47,390
Dr. Stevens will
give you the details.

113
00:05:47,414 --> 00:05:50,932
Hmm. I wish Dr. Stevens
would give me the details,

114
00:05:51,034 --> 00:05:53,096
but I'm just the person
who saved her life.

115
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,919
- OK.
- You know that if you miss

116
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:57,906
- another IL-2 treatment...
- I got my treatment
at Seattle Pres.

117
00:05:58,008 --> 00:06:00,141
I may not be a doctor,
but I'm not an idiot.

118
00:06:00,243 --> 00:06:02,143
Iz...

119
00:06:25,686 --> 00:06:29,954
- You heard from Casella?
- Yeah, I heard he took
another tour.

120
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:32,023
I'm sorry, where
were you before?

121
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:34,358
- In Baghdad with Dr. Hunt.
- No, before that.

122
00:06:34,461 --> 00:06:36,105
- Where'd you do
your fellowship?
- Mayo.

123
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:38,124
- With Paul Moak?
- Moak is in Rochester.

124
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:39,859
I worked primarily
with Joshua Moore.

125
00:06:39,883 --> 00:06:43,317
Oh. You went to Mayo in Florida.

126
00:06:43,419 --> 00:06:46,420
Moore wrote that paper on
retrograde coronary sinus perfusion?

127
00:06:46,523 --> 00:06:49,975
- I worked on that with him.
- I almost... I considered Mayo...

128
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:53,412
- Where'd you go to med school?
- Dr. Yang is a little thorough.

129
00:06:53,514 --> 00:06:56,231
UT Southwestern. I did
my residency at G-W...

130
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:57,765
Have you published?

131
00:06:57,868 --> 00:07:00,546
According to Google,
you don't exist.

132
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:04,889
Oh, my God. It's raining!

133
00:07:06,326 --> 00:07:09,860
- It's Seattle, it rains a lot.
- Whoo! Hunt! How awesome
is this?

134
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:16,467
She's been living in the
desert for a long time.

135
00:07:26,329 --> 00:07:31,449
- That is not a Cardio god.
- She is an incredible surgeon.

136
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,368
This is great!

137
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:36,590
So what's your story with her?

138
00:07:37,758 --> 00:07:39,658
There's no story. We're friends.

139
00:07:41,611 --> 00:07:43,161
How long is she here for?

140
00:07:43,246 --> 00:07:46,982
The chief offered a limited
contract to test the waters.

141
00:07:47,084 --> 00:07:48,649
Look, I really
appreciate the gift,

142
00:07:48,752 --> 00:07:51,569
really I do, but you
need to take it back.

143
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:53,016
- Cristina...
- Take it back,

144
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,217
and exchange it for
a real Cardio god.

145
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:58,643
Just give her a chance. I
promise, she's gonna surprise you.

146
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:06,634
I guess you do have a boyfriend.

147
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:15,437
Are those his results?
Let me see them.

148
00:08:15,461 --> 00:08:18,213
If you were a doctor here,
I could. They're normal.

149
00:08:18,315 --> 00:08:20,865
All of them. Blood
work, CT, all normal.

150
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:24,302
We need to do a spinal tap. He
could have a subarachnoid hemorrhage.

151
00:08:24,404 --> 00:08:27,455
What, did you think if you
made some great neuro save,

152
00:08:27,557 --> 00:08:29,523
Shepherd would give
you your job back?

153
00:08:29,626 --> 00:08:31,120
I'm not here to get my job back.

154
00:08:31,144 --> 00:08:34,145
- Hello!
- Good, 'cause it's not gonna happen.

155
00:08:36,382 --> 00:08:39,217
Dr. Singer, I'm here. I'm here.

156
00:08:39,319 --> 00:08:41,531
What's happening?
What's happening?

157
00:08:41,555 --> 00:08:43,922
One minute I'm in
class, the next minute...

158
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:46,791
- You're here
at Seattle Grace Hospital.
- I am not!

159
00:08:46,894 --> 00:08:49,360
- Yes. I brought you here.
- No! It's not possible!

160
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:52,547
- I have a class! What time is it?
- Please! Come back to bed!

161
00:08:52,649 --> 00:08:55,350
- No, let me go!
- Dr. Singer!

162
00:08:56,219 --> 00:08:59,237
Oh, my God. Dr. Singer?

163
00:08:59,989 --> 00:09:02,290
What's happening to me?

164
00:09:12,351 --> 00:09:13,701
Chief!

165
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:16,054
- What we got?
- An emergency chole,

166
00:09:16,156 --> 00:09:20,941
a new cardio attending and
your wife is here to see you.

167
00:09:21,044 --> 00:09:25,096
- What?
- You in trouble. Drink your latte.

168
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:29,812
He needs a spinal tap. He's fallen
and could've burst an aneurysm.

169
00:09:29,836 --> 00:09:32,570
Some bleeds show up on a
spinal tap that don't on CT.

170
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:35,906
And some doctors enjoy torturing
patients because they messed up

171
00:09:36,008 --> 00:09:39,177
and don't know what they're
gonna do with the rest of their lives.

172
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:42,346
You are the one that got me
fired. You owe me this, you bitch!

173
00:09:42,448 --> 00:09:45,883
Unless you want me to find
that snotty... what's her name?

174
00:09:45,986 --> 00:09:50,655
And tell her how much
you love her? 'Cause I will.

175
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:55,554
Sick sinus syndrome.

176
00:09:55,578 --> 00:09:57,523
She needs a transvenous
pacemaker now.

177
00:09:57,547 --> 00:10:00,214
Dr. Yang, want to take this? I
haven't done one in ten years.

178
00:10:00,316 --> 00:10:01,833
- Excuse me?
- I do.

179
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:04,352
- Great. It's all yours.
- You don't remember how?

180
00:10:04,454 --> 00:10:07,088
I've been working primarily
on soldiers, Dr. Yang,

181
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:09,541
most of whom are well
under the age of 70.

182
00:10:09,643 --> 00:10:13,861
Use the right IJ, Dr. Avery. It'll
give you the most direct approach.

183
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:18,394
Dr. Altman, will you
excuse me for a moment?

184
00:10:18,418 --> 00:10:21,403
I just need to talk to the
chief about something.

185
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:34,099
She has been staying
with her mom in Chehalis.

186
00:10:34,201 --> 00:10:36,851
I don't know how long
she's staying, if she's staying.

187
00:10:36,953 --> 00:10:41,155
She has been keeping up with
her IL-2. That much I do know.

188
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:46,961
That's all I know.

189
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:01,426
I was up till all hours,
working on the budget.

190
00:11:01,528 --> 00:11:03,339
By the time you
realized what time it was,

191
00:11:03,363 --> 00:11:05,923
it was too late to let Adele know
you were going to sleep here,

192
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:08,077
what I will tell her
while you're in surgery.

193
00:11:08,101 --> 00:11:09,621
- Thank you, Bailey.
- Chief?

194
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:11,669
Not the time. Chief
has emergency surgery.

195
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:13,838
The Chief has an
emergency cardio situation.

196
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:16,674
New attending doesn't know
how to put in a pacemaker.

197
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:18,709
- Yang...
- Do not engage.

198
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:22,196
Did you or did you not ask this
man for a new Cardio attending?

199
00:11:22,299 --> 00:11:24,398
- Yes.
- And did he or did he not

200
00:11:24,501 --> 00:11:28,118
bring in attending after attending,
none of whom seemed to please you,

201
00:11:28,204 --> 00:11:29,870
and all of whom you ran off?

202
00:11:29,972 --> 00:11:33,457
- That is not a fair assessment.
- Dr. Yang, has it occurred
to you

203
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:36,544
that you might be the problem?

204
00:11:36,646 --> 00:11:39,564
Yeah, right. Leave this man
alone, go torture the new attending.

205
00:11:39,649 --> 00:11:42,750
- Sir...
- Yang, do as Bailey says.

206
00:11:44,988 --> 00:11:47,689
And you are due in surgery.

207
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:50,057
Bailey, what would
I do without you?

208
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:51,837
Let's hope you
never have to find out.

209
00:11:51,861 --> 00:11:54,262
Is your trauma patient
stable for skin grafting?

210
00:11:54,363 --> 00:11:56,931
- With the pancreatic
duct rupture?
- Miranda?

211
00:11:57,033 --> 00:12:02,503
Adele! I'm so sorry. I sent the
chief into surgery. Do you want me...?

212
00:12:02,605 --> 00:12:06,891
What I want is for
you to tell me the truth.

213
00:12:06,993 --> 00:12:09,844
Are you having an
affair with my husband?

214
00:12:20,107 --> 00:12:24,308
I... I am not having an
affair with your husband!

215
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:27,746
I saw the way you
handled him just now.

216
00:12:27,848 --> 00:12:30,949
I did not handle him!

217
00:12:31,051 --> 00:12:33,501
There was no handling.
We work together!

218
00:12:33,603 --> 00:12:37,488
You spend every waking moment together.
You finish each other's sentences.

219
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:41,425
You read each other's minds. You're
more married to that man than I am.

220
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:44,679
Yeah, but that's just because
they're husband and work-wife.

221
00:12:44,781 --> 00:12:47,076
- Excuse me?
- The chief
is your work-husband.

222
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,950
You're his work-wife.
You look out for each other.

223
00:12:50,052 --> 00:12:52,253
You take care of each
other. It's like me and Sloan.

224
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:54,639
- Excuse me?
- Nobody's talking to you.

225
00:12:54,741 --> 00:12:58,226
He's my work-husband, but he
has a girlfriend. I have a girlfriend.

226
00:12:58,328 --> 00:13:00,895
- Nothing going on between us.
- There was at one point...

227
00:13:00,997 --> 00:13:03,364
- You're not helping.
- Neither one of you are.

228
00:13:03,466 --> 00:13:06,984
Adele, I promise you,
there is nothing going on.

229
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:11,072
Something is going on because
he hasn't been in his bed all week.

230
00:13:11,174 --> 00:13:12,585
- What?
- Really?

231
00:13:12,609 --> 00:13:15,676
The last time he acted
like this, disappearing,

232
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:19,480
sleeping at the hospital every
night, he was with Ellis Grey.

233
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:22,083
He may not be having
an affair with you...

234
00:13:22,185 --> 00:13:24,702
He's not. I promise you.
I promise you he's not.

235
00:13:30,227 --> 00:13:31,809
OK.

236
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:36,180
But wife-wife to work-wife,
someone in this hospital

237
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:39,050
is sleeping with our husband.

238
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:48,192
How we doing, Dr. Yang?

239
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:51,445
Gary Clark, 57. ST elevation
in leads one through four.

240
00:13:51,547 --> 00:13:53,847
- Which would indicate?
- Anterior heart attack.

241
00:13:53,949 --> 00:13:56,767
Blockage in the LAD. He's
ready for an angioplasty.

242
00:13:56,869 --> 00:14:00,471
- Talk me through the procedure.
- Because you don't remember
how?

243
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:03,341
No, that was actually
a teaching moment.

244
00:14:03,443 --> 00:14:06,411
Access the femoral artery,
thread the catheter to the heart,

245
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:09,063
- inject dye,
then open up the blockage.
- Good.

246
00:14:09,165 --> 00:14:11,165
Use the pigtail
catheter to get a good...

247
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:12,399
Like this one?

248
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:17,905
Huh. Look at that. Dr. Avery,
what can we infer from this?

249
00:14:18,007 --> 00:14:21,459
- Wall motion abnormalities.
- Yes, in the left ventricular
wall.

250
00:14:21,561 --> 00:14:24,795
- Let's get into
the left coronary tree.
- Already there.

251
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:28,566
Oh. OK. Um...

252
00:14:28,668 --> 00:14:31,402
Well, you want to make sure
you get images in many planes

253
00:14:31,504 --> 00:14:34,572
- so you have
to shift the fluoro...
- We use rotational angiography.

254
00:14:34,674 --> 00:14:39,760
- It does that on its own.
- Huh. Look at that.

255
00:14:39,862 --> 00:14:44,081
- I guess I learned
something today.
- Yeah. Look at that.

256
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:49,203
- Chief?
- Uh-huh.

257
00:14:52,709 --> 00:14:55,176
OK, I understand you are under

258
00:14:55,278 --> 00:14:57,812
a tremendous amount
of pressure right now,

259
00:14:57,914 --> 00:15:01,299
and that you haven't been
able to spend time at home,

260
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:05,970
and that a man, in your
position, has certain...

261
00:15:06,539 --> 00:15:08,623
needs,

262
00:15:08,725 --> 00:15:12,810
and that, when a
man is as powerful

263
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:18,299
and as attractive as you are,
those needs might easily be met by...

264
00:15:18,401 --> 00:15:20,351
- Dr. Bailey.
- Yes, sir?

265
00:15:20,453 --> 00:15:24,539
- Are you hitting on me?
- Your wife just showed up here

266
00:15:24,641 --> 00:15:27,025
asking me if you and I
were having an affair.

267
00:15:27,127 --> 00:15:30,060
No, no. I don't want to know
anything about anything.

268
00:15:30,163 --> 00:15:32,513
What you do with your
business is your business.

269
00:15:32,615 --> 00:15:36,283
And I was not hitting on you.

270
00:15:36,385 --> 00:15:38,469
- Understood.
- Mm-hm.

271
00:15:45,412 --> 00:15:50,164
Dr. Percy is almost done getting
the spinal fluid sample he needs.

272
00:15:50,266 --> 00:15:53,084
- Yeah. Not that
I had any choice.
- That makes two of us.

273
00:15:53,186 --> 00:15:54,802
You're doing great. Almost done.

274
00:15:54,904 --> 00:15:57,864
What's going on with you and
Karev? Have you even talked to him?

275
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:01,942
- How is that any
of your business?
- It's everybody's business.

276
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:05,663
It's all anybody talks about
here, Stevens and Karev.

277
00:16:05,765 --> 00:16:09,216
Have they talked? Are
they talking? So are you?

278
00:16:11,538 --> 00:16:15,989
That's it. You're all done. I just
need you to lie flat for a while, OK?

279
00:16:16,091 --> 00:16:17,853
See? That wasn't so bad, was it?

280
00:16:17,877 --> 00:16:21,228
So this Karev... he's the boy?
The one who got you in trouble?

281
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:25,566
- Well, he didn't
help matters much.
- Did he propose?

282
00:16:26,836 --> 00:16:29,253
Well, whatever you
do, don't marry him.

283
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:32,268
If you do and you have this child,
you'll never become a surgeon.

284
00:16:32,292 --> 00:16:35,910
You'll probably never
even make it out of Chehalis.

285
00:16:36,011 --> 00:16:40,681
What you will do, though, is
end up angry and frustrated and...

286
00:16:40,783 --> 00:16:43,985
alone.

287
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:49,073
You gotta do
what's good for you.

288
00:16:49,158 --> 00:16:53,344
And if this boy really cares
for you, he'll understand.

289
00:17:05,925 --> 00:17:08,342
- How'd you find me here?
- The nurses love me.

290
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:09,843
They're my spies.

291
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:12,646
And they're pissed you're
desterilizing all their equipment.

292
00:17:12,748 --> 00:17:15,015
What else was I supposed to do?

293
00:17:15,118 --> 00:17:17,601
I haven't been able to
get on a surgery all day.

294
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:21,555
Before I left, there were five people
to compete with, and now there are 25.

295
00:17:21,657 --> 00:17:23,757
You'll get in the
OR soon enough.

296
00:17:23,859 --> 00:17:27,144
You know, there was a
moment, for like five seconds,

297
00:17:27,247 --> 00:17:32,516
when hit-by-a-bus guy wasn't George,
and Izzie had just come through surgery,

298
00:17:32,619 --> 00:17:34,880
and you and I had
just done our Post-it.

299
00:17:34,904 --> 00:17:36,387
Mm-hm.

300
00:17:36,489 --> 00:17:38,956
Five seconds when everybody
was happy. I keep closing my eyes,

301
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:42,660
- trying to get back to that.
- Here. Turn around.

302
00:17:45,432 --> 00:17:46,714
Close your eyes.

303
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,020
One.

304
00:17:54,123 --> 00:17:55,956
Two.

305
00:17:56,058 --> 00:17:57,508
Three.

306
00:17:59,345 --> 00:18:00,861
Four.

307
00:18:03,766 --> 00:18:05,098
Five.

308
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,202
- How was that?
- Almost perfect.

309
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:11,205
Five almost perfect seconds.

310
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:14,575
Call me when you
want five more, OK?

311
00:18:17,797 --> 00:18:19,597
Stevens?

312
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:22,633
Results of the spinal tap.

313
00:18:24,304 --> 00:18:27,505
They're normal. Damn it.

314
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:30,141
I'm sorry for wasting your time.

315
00:18:35,631 --> 00:18:36,911
Dr. Singer?

316
00:18:38,301 --> 00:18:40,118
Isobel?

317
00:18:40,903 --> 00:18:43,571
Isobel Stevens? Oh, my God!

318
00:18:43,673 --> 00:18:46,607
- Look at you, all grown up.
- I am?

319
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:51,278
What...? What am I doing here? Why
am I in my pajamas? Is something...?

320
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,080
Is there something
wrong with me?

321
00:18:53,182 --> 00:18:57,001
- He's lucid.
- Go page Shepherd.

322
00:18:58,854 --> 00:19:03,190
Dr. Bailey? Do you mind if I
scrub in on the chief's ileostomy?

323
00:19:03,292 --> 00:19:05,793
Yes, I do mind. That man is
old enough to be your father.

324
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:09,062
- Dr. Bailey, have you
seen the chief?
- No! Uh-uh...

325
00:19:09,164 --> 00:19:12,266
You don't need to be seeing
the chief, either one of you.

326
00:19:12,368 --> 00:19:15,219
But something's wrong with
his emergency chole patient.

327
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:17,921
OK. So you tell me,
and I'll tell the chief.

328
00:19:18,024 --> 00:19:21,124
- What's wrong with him?
- He's yellow.

329
00:19:24,297 --> 00:19:25,663
Oh.

330
00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:37,674
This is the yellowest
man that I've ever seen.

331
00:19:37,776 --> 00:19:40,644
- Right? He's lemon-yellow.
- Like, mustard-yellow.

332
00:19:40,747 --> 00:19:43,714
We get it, he's yellow!
I'm trying to find out why.

333
00:19:43,816 --> 00:19:46,267
Ultrasound shows dilated ducts.

334
00:19:46,369 --> 00:19:50,454
Which means obstructive jaundice, but
the chief only took out the gallbladder.

335
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:53,724
We never saw any signs
of liver disease or cancers.

336
00:19:53,826 --> 00:19:55,692
Could that mean...?

337
00:19:55,794 --> 00:19:58,963
- Chief clipped
the common bile duct?
- Oh, my God!

338
00:19:59,065 --> 00:20:02,349
OK, stop. Right
now. Both of you.

339
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:05,218
Did you actually see the
chief clip the common bile duct?

340
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,921
- No, of course not. But...
- But nothing.

341
00:20:08,024 --> 00:20:10,841
That's one of the most serious
mistakes a surgeon can make.

342
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:13,160
So let's not make
this accusation lightly.

343
00:20:13,262 --> 00:20:15,462
- It wasn't an accusation.
- Stop talking.

344
00:20:15,564 --> 00:20:21,369
Just get an ERCP to find the exact
cause of this man's... discoloration.

345
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:27,458
And doctors? If I find out that either
of you has said a word about this

346
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:31,828
to anyone, I will make sure that you are
the ones who require emergency surgery.

347
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:39,453
You have a condition called NPH:
normal pressure hydrocephalus.

348
00:20:39,555 --> 00:20:44,791
It's a buildup of cerebrospinal fluid
in your brain, very hard to diagnose.

349
00:20:44,894 --> 00:20:48,094
- But thanks to Dr. Percy...
- The spinal tap removed
some fluid,

350
00:20:48,197 --> 00:20:50,865
relieving pressure in your
brain, resolving symptoms,

351
00:20:50,967 --> 00:20:52,716
which is how we
came to your diagnosis.

352
00:20:52,818 --> 00:20:55,185
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

353
00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:57,521
Dr. Shepherd wants to
put in a permanent shunt.

354
00:20:57,623 --> 00:20:59,923
It'll drain the excess
fluid to the abdomen.

355
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:01,936
That sounds like major surgery.

356
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:05,046
It's 45 minutes. It's a very common
procedure. I do it all the time.

357
00:21:05,148 --> 00:21:06,830
Hmm.

358
00:21:08,634 --> 00:21:12,536
I don't think I could afford it.
My savings, my retirement...

359
00:21:12,638 --> 00:21:16,006
It all went to my late
wife's medical care.

360
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,625
So...

361
00:21:19,328 --> 00:21:20,977
What do I do?

362
00:21:23,466 --> 00:21:25,499
- Dr. Shepherd.
- Stevens?

363
00:21:25,601 --> 00:21:28,101
I hate to ask this of you
after everything you've done,

364
00:21:28,203 --> 00:21:32,973
but is there any way Dr. Singer's
surgery could be pro bono?

365
00:21:33,076 --> 00:21:36,827
If you get the chief to sign off on
this, I'd be happy to donate my time.

366
00:21:39,966 --> 00:21:42,383
- You don't think it's Bailey?
- No!

367
00:21:42,485 --> 00:21:44,718
Really? I kinda
like them together.

368
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:47,120
- It's not Yang?
- What are you talking about?

369
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:48,462
You haven't heard? The Chief...

370
00:21:48,524 --> 00:21:50,424
Mark, you are a terrible gossip.

371
00:21:50,526 --> 00:21:53,027
- I'm an excellent gossip.
- Mind if we join you?

372
00:21:53,128 --> 00:21:55,412
- No. Have a seat.
- Not at all.

373
00:21:56,682 --> 00:21:59,466
How's your first day? You
ready to go back to Baghdad yet?

374
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:02,502
I'm actually really impressed.
The facility, the equipment,

375
00:22:02,605 --> 00:22:05,222
- caliber of residents.
- Have you met Cristina Yang?

376
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:09,726
Mmm. Cristina Yang may, in fact,
be the best resident I've ever seen.

377
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:11,272
- You think?
- Yeah. I do.

378
00:22:11,296 --> 00:22:12,997
I don't think she
likes me, but yeah.

379
00:22:13,098 --> 00:22:15,666
- Ooh. She doesn't like you?
- Mark.

380
00:22:15,768 --> 00:22:17,567
No, you're probably right.

381
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:20,654
Just because Yang drove off
the last three Cardio attendings...

382
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:21,933
- She did not.
- Burke.

383
00:22:21,957 --> 00:22:23,435
- Come on, that...
- Hahn.

384
00:22:23,459 --> 00:22:26,026
She had nothing to
do with Hahn leaving.

385
00:22:26,129 --> 00:22:28,011
No, that was me.

386
00:22:28,113 --> 00:22:29,963
- Dixon.
- Cristina just needs

387
00:22:30,065 --> 00:22:33,850
a strong Cardio attending. She
deserves a strong Cardio attending.

388
00:22:33,952 --> 00:22:37,338
Cristina? Huh. Wow.

389
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,473
So... So you and Yang?

390
00:22:39,575 --> 00:22:41,954
- What happened to you and Beth?
- He didn't tell you?

391
00:22:41,978 --> 00:22:44,790
Beth showed up at the hospital one
day. She didn't even know he was...

392
00:22:44,814 --> 00:22:46,514
Ow!

393
00:22:47,416 --> 00:22:50,300
- Did you just kick me?
- That was me.

394
00:22:50,402 --> 00:22:52,702
So... wait.

395
00:22:52,804 --> 00:22:56,540
When you called me up and told me about
this great job at this great hospital,

396
00:22:56,642 --> 00:23:01,478
you were just bringing me out here
as a present for your new girlfriend?

397
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:05,282
It is a great job
with great people,

398
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:08,168
one of whom just
happens to be...

399
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:10,403
Yeah. Yeah.

400
00:23:10,505 --> 00:23:12,940
That's OK. I'm not mad. I'm
just gonna enjoy all the ways

401
00:23:13,042 --> 00:23:14,908
you'll have to make it up to me.

402
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:18,045
OK.

403
00:23:18,147 --> 00:23:19,774
So how do you like your present?

404
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:23,333
Who, Private Benjamin over there?
Owen said she would surprise me.

405
00:23:23,435 --> 00:23:26,954
Well, guess what? Surprise! She
doesn't know how to do surgery.

406
00:23:27,056 --> 00:23:30,273
- Leave her alone,
it's her first day.
- Why are you defending her?

407
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:32,743
- She went to a state school.
- So did I.

408
00:23:33,846 --> 00:23:36,397
- She's skinny and blond.
- So is Mer.

409
00:23:38,067 --> 00:23:40,033
- She's annoying.
- So are you.

410
00:23:41,754 --> 00:23:43,304
Where is your wife, by the way?

411
00:23:43,406 --> 00:23:45,989
Uh... What did you say to Owen?

412
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:47,691
That she's gotta go.

413
00:23:47,793 --> 00:23:51,562
He knows how important this is. I need
someone to take me to the next level,

414
00:23:51,664 --> 00:23:54,231
and he brings me this
Desert Storm Barbie

415
00:23:54,333 --> 00:23:56,801
who hasn't seen the inside
of an OR in ten years?

416
00:23:56,903 --> 00:24:00,620
I mean, if this is what he thinks of
my talent, I gotta break up with him.

417
00:24:02,891 --> 00:24:05,576
Have you talked to Izzie
yet? Has anyone talked to her?

418
00:24:05,678 --> 00:24:08,845
You know what? No one's
allowed to talk about Izzie while I eat.

419
00:24:11,216 --> 00:24:13,651
Am I the only one
who's concerned here?

420
00:24:15,254 --> 00:24:17,120
- What?
- It's my first day back.

421
00:24:17,222 --> 00:24:19,234
I wanted to have a
normal lunch together.

422
00:24:19,258 --> 00:24:21,224
Oh, yeah. Take a look around.

423
00:24:21,326 --> 00:24:22,976
Nothing's normal.

424
00:24:26,165 --> 00:24:30,801
- It's a 45 minute surgery.
- It's a $10,000 surgery.

425
00:24:30,903 --> 00:24:32,736
And this hospital has
a pro bono budget.

426
00:24:32,839 --> 00:24:34,755
You are no longer a doctor here.

427
00:24:34,857 --> 00:24:38,508
And you have no right to come in here
and commandeer a clinic, a neurosurgeon

428
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:41,695
- and a resident.
- I gave you eight
million dollars

429
00:24:41,797 --> 00:24:44,748
to build that clinic that you
happily accepted at the time.

430
00:24:44,851 --> 00:24:47,951
So I have no problem going to
the board or the press if I have to

431
00:24:48,053 --> 00:24:51,272
to get Dr. Singer
the surgery he needs.

432
00:24:54,327 --> 00:24:57,055
Where did you work with Jordan
Hamlin? She's been at Stanford forever.

433
00:24:57,079 --> 00:25:01,065
Jordan Hamlin and I were bunkmates
at Camp Taka-toka when we were 11.

434
00:25:01,167 --> 00:25:03,378
That girl can make
a mean lanyard.

435
00:25:03,402 --> 00:25:05,047
You guys paged
me? What's going on?

436
00:25:05,071 --> 00:25:06,853
This is Casey, age
eight, asthmatic.

437
00:25:06,956 --> 00:25:09,717
- Nebs at home
haven't been working.
- We added steroids,

438
00:25:09,741 --> 00:25:12,743
- but he's having
trouble breathing.
- Casey, I'm Dr. Robbins.

439
00:25:12,845 --> 00:25:16,229
- I'll look at your X-rays. You mind?
- No, go ahead.

440
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:20,233
Hey, Casey. Just
gonna take a listen.

441
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:33,079
- Dr. Altman, are you...?
- Trying to concentrate,
Dr. Yang.

442
00:25:33,181 --> 00:25:36,483
Has Casey had any
other medical issues?

443
00:25:36,585 --> 00:25:38,986
A febrile seizure
at three months.

444
00:25:39,104 --> 00:25:40,231
OK. Can you sit up for me?

445
00:25:42,741 --> 00:25:44,620
Did he scream a lot when you
brought him home from the hospital?

446
00:25:44,644 --> 00:25:46,309
Yes.

447
00:25:46,411 --> 00:25:48,945
Has his asthma gotten better
or worse as he's gotten older?

448
00:25:49,031 --> 00:25:52,799
- Worse.
- OK. Thanks.

449
00:25:56,222 --> 00:25:58,255
- Book an OR.
- What? Why?

450
00:25:58,357 --> 00:26:00,357
- Because I said so.
- But he has asthma.

451
00:26:00,425 --> 00:26:03,827
- Cardiac asthma, Dr. Yang.
- And you know that because...

452
00:26:03,912 --> 00:26:06,240
That seizure he had?
It wasn't from a fever.

453
00:26:06,264 --> 00:26:08,704
He had a heart attack then,
and he's having one now.

454
00:26:08,783 --> 00:26:12,185
Book an OR, because I'm your attending,
and when I tell you to book an OR,

455
00:26:12,287 --> 00:26:14,270
book an OR!

456
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:22,813
I like her.

457
00:26:30,206 --> 00:26:33,624
I'm going to say a name. And
then you are going to tell me

458
00:26:33,726 --> 00:26:36,192
you are not having
an affair with her.

459
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:40,480
- Izzie Stevens.
- What?

460
00:26:40,582 --> 00:26:43,250
That's why you ignored the DNR.

461
00:26:43,352 --> 00:26:46,086
That's why you fired her.

462
00:26:46,188 --> 00:26:49,456
That's why the two of
you were in your office

463
00:26:49,558 --> 00:26:53,293
screaming at each other
just... It is not funny, chief!

464
00:26:53,395 --> 00:26:56,663
That girl has cancer
and a husband and...

465
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:03,770
OK, I know it's none of my business,
but it's now affecting people's lives.

466
00:27:03,873 --> 00:27:05,022
Patients' lives.

467
00:27:05,124 --> 00:27:07,124
What's this?

468
00:27:07,226 --> 00:27:11,094
It's the ERCP results of your
emergency chole this morning.

469
00:27:11,196 --> 00:27:16,667
It seems that you may have
accidentally clipped the common bile duct.

470
00:27:26,012 --> 00:27:29,412
- How's the patient?
- Stable, for now.

471
00:27:29,514 --> 00:27:34,250
I told Grey and Adamson
to prep him for a repair.

472
00:27:34,353 --> 00:27:38,822
Which I'm happy to
do, if you don't feel...

473
00:27:41,193 --> 00:27:44,077
We caught it early enough that,

474
00:27:44,179 --> 00:27:47,881
if we can repair the duct, there
should be no long-term damage.

475
00:27:51,853 --> 00:27:53,837
No one knows about this, sir.

476
00:27:55,574 --> 00:27:57,957
And no one's going to know.

477
00:28:02,314 --> 00:28:05,249
But whatever it is
that's distracting you,

478
00:28:05,351 --> 00:28:09,386
whoever or whatever it is,

479
00:28:09,471 --> 00:28:12,339
I just hope you get
a handle on it soon.

480
00:28:26,171 --> 00:28:29,472
- The birds on your
scrub cap are cute.
- Thank you.

481
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,277
- Is he on full bypass?
- Yes.

482
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:35,979
See the anatomy here?

483
00:28:36,081 --> 00:28:39,716
Coronary artery is attached to
the pulmonary artery, not the aorta.

484
00:28:39,818 --> 00:28:41,868
It presented as
asthma, but it's ALCAPA.

485
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:43,470
How did you know?

486
00:28:43,572 --> 00:28:47,240
You only listened to him and
asked his mom a couple questions.

487
00:28:47,342 --> 00:28:49,309
I saw some cardiomegaly
on his X-rays,

488
00:28:49,411 --> 00:28:51,878
and heard a holosystolic
murmur through wheezing.

489
00:28:51,997 --> 00:28:54,181
You'll know for next time.

490
00:28:54,283 --> 00:28:58,852
And after today, Dr. Yang,
you'll know how to fix it.

491
00:28:58,954 --> 00:29:01,605
Me? I...

492
00:29:01,707 --> 00:29:04,267
- I thought you
and Dr. Robbins were...
- Dr. Robbins,

493
00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:07,194
- do you mind if
Dr. Yang first-assists?
- Not at all.

494
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:20,707
Maybe we'll both
learn something today.

495
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:37,707
The guy Izzie brought in has
NPH. Derek's operating now.

496
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:40,043
I snuck her into the
gallery so she can watch.

497
00:29:40,128 --> 00:29:42,612
So if you want
to go talk to her...

498
00:29:46,351 --> 00:29:49,085
- OK?
- Just explain her to me, OK?

499
00:29:49,187 --> 00:29:52,105
Because I don't
get it. I don't get her.

500
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:54,524
And I do? I'm like you.

501
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:59,379
She's bright and shiny, after everything
she's been through. I don't get it.

502
00:29:59,481 --> 00:30:04,117
But you're the one who married her,
so you're the one who has to figure it out.

503
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:05,519
I can't solve everything.

504
00:30:05,621 --> 00:30:08,872
I lost the better part of my
liver trying to solve everything.

505
00:30:08,974 --> 00:30:13,493
So if you want an explanation,
you have to go talk to Iz.

506
00:30:23,338 --> 00:30:27,240
OK. Here we go. The moment of
truth. Let's see Dr. Yang's handiwork.

507
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:38,284
- V-fib on the monitor.
- - Thank you for that update.

508
00:30:38,386 --> 00:30:40,820
The bleeding's behind
the coronary anastomosis.

509
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:42,806
My Anastomosis. What'd I do?

510
00:30:42,908 --> 00:30:44,791
It doesn't matter what you did.

511
00:30:44,893 --> 00:30:48,278
What matters is what are
you going to do to fix it?

512
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:49,996
Feel free to jump
in here at any time.

513
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:52,382
You can do this. Tell
me what you want to do.

514
00:30:56,488 --> 00:30:59,189
- I want to defibrillate.
- Then defibrillate.

515
00:31:00,375 --> 00:31:01,791
I'll unclamp.

516
00:31:06,315 --> 00:31:08,315
Charge to 20. Clear!

517
00:31:12,604 --> 00:31:14,154
Nice.

518
00:31:15,924 --> 00:31:18,758
Now, keep your eyes on the
field and do exactly as I say.

519
00:31:18,878 --> 00:31:22,445
We're gonna try to fix this without
rearresting the heart. You with me?

520
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:24,764
- Yes.
- Good.

521
00:31:26,252 --> 00:31:29,786
You need to apply a suture
proximally and distally.

522
00:31:32,708 --> 00:31:34,685
Good. Dr. Avery,
are you watching this?

523
00:31:34,709 --> 00:31:39,012
- There will be
a quiz afterward.
- Believe me, I'm watching.

524
00:31:40,849 --> 00:31:42,248
Good.

525
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:09,559
- So are you back or...?
- Oh. Did you want me
to come back?

526
00:32:09,661 --> 00:32:13,663
Because you told the chief you had
serious doubts about my abilities...

527
00:32:13,766 --> 00:32:15,899
- What?
- You went behind my back

528
00:32:16,001 --> 00:32:18,251
and told the chief I
wasn't ready to be here.

529
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:20,937
He was making cuts.
I was protecting you.

530
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:23,890
- You got me fired, Alex.
- Is that what you think?

531
00:32:23,992 --> 00:32:26,326
This job was the
one thing I had left.

532
00:32:26,428 --> 00:32:29,429
The one thing, and you
took that away from me.

533
00:32:29,531 --> 00:32:31,964
You interfered and got me fired.

534
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:35,886
I have forgiven
you for a lot, Alex.

535
00:32:35,988 --> 00:32:39,856
I've had to forgive you for a lot,
but I cannot forgive you for this.

536
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,893
You made an assumption.

537
00:32:43,996 --> 00:32:46,529
You decided I did something.

538
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:51,335
You didn't ask. You
didn't hang around to talk.

539
00:32:52,938 --> 00:32:57,057
I am your husband, and you didn't
give me the benefit of the doubt.

540
00:32:58,126 --> 00:33:02,411
So you know what? I
can't forgive you, either.

541
00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:28,205
Chief, you all right?

542
00:33:28,307 --> 00:33:31,641
- You did the repair?
- Yeah. No complications.

543
00:33:31,743 --> 00:33:37,213
We're hoping for a full recovery.
And, like I said, nobody knows.

544
00:33:42,871 --> 00:33:45,505
I'm not having an affair.

545
00:33:47,075 --> 00:33:51,144
Well, what is it,
then? Is it the merger?

546
00:33:51,246 --> 00:33:54,280
Is it Jennings and the
board, or you and Shepherd?

547
00:33:54,382 --> 00:33:57,868
'Cause your wife is right.
There's something going on.

548
00:34:01,172 --> 00:34:04,424
I've decided to take a step
back from surgery for a while.

549
00:34:04,526 --> 00:34:08,845
- There's no reason to do that.
- I've got enough on my plate
as chief.

550
00:34:08,947 --> 00:34:11,480
I can't afford another mistake.

551
00:34:15,153 --> 00:34:17,787
I'd like you to take over my
surgeries for the time being.

552
00:34:17,873 --> 00:34:20,273
- Chief...
- If you don't mind.

553
00:34:31,536 --> 00:34:35,105
- How's the patient doing?
- Mmm. Perfect.

554
00:34:35,207 --> 00:34:37,573
It's like someone just
switched the lights on.

555
00:34:37,675 --> 00:34:40,293
Dr. Shepherd said you did great.

556
00:34:40,395 --> 00:34:42,996
We can get you home, get
you out of that nursing home.

557
00:34:43,098 --> 00:34:45,058
You could go back
to teaching if you want.

558
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:49,486
Are you crazy? I'm never going back
to those sex-crazed, teenage alcoholics.

559
00:34:49,588 --> 00:34:51,788
- No way.
- OK.

560
00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:54,757
- What are you gonna do then?
- I don't know.

561
00:34:54,859 --> 00:34:58,044
But... thanks to you,

562
00:34:58,146 --> 00:35:02,098
I have a few more mental
faculties to figure it out with.

563
00:35:03,285 --> 00:35:04,817
How about you?

564
00:35:06,154 --> 00:35:08,104
I don't know yet, either.

565
00:35:13,494 --> 00:35:15,461
You're still my best student.

566
00:35:16,932 --> 00:35:18,631
Let's get you home.

567
00:35:21,803 --> 00:35:24,637
- Guess what I did today?
- Whatever it was,

568
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:28,508
it's better than getting surgeries
stolen by Mercy West residents.

569
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:31,628
It was. I did a Takeuchi repair.

570
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:35,148
- You did not.
- Not all by myself.

571
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:38,818
But Altman did let me do the
coronary artery anastomosis.

572
00:35:38,921 --> 00:35:42,805
- Wow. Maybe she is
a Cardio god.
- Yeah, I know.

573
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:56,319
Here are tomorrow's surgeries.
We can go over them in the morning.

574
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:04,010
What...? What's going on?

575
00:36:04,112 --> 00:36:06,779
The chief's taking some time
off from surgery for a while.

576
00:36:06,881 --> 00:36:10,383
- Because he's having an affair?
- Because of the merger.

577
00:36:10,485 --> 00:36:13,853
He's not having an
affair! He's exhausted.

578
00:36:15,056 --> 00:36:18,341
Now, I've lost my work-husband
and my husband-husband.

579
00:36:18,443 --> 00:36:21,594
- So I'll be your work-husband.
- You already have Sloan.

580
00:36:21,696 --> 00:36:23,763
That's true. What
about Shepherd?

581
00:36:23,865 --> 00:36:27,684
Are you kidding? All that hair?
I can't be looking at that all day.

582
00:36:35,043 --> 00:36:38,078
- Hey.
- Hey.

583
00:36:39,681 --> 00:36:41,781
- So...
- Mm-hm.

584
00:36:42,917 --> 00:36:45,835
- Cristina Yang...
- Yeah.

585
00:36:45,938 --> 00:36:49,556
I probably should've told you,
but I didn't want to bias you.

586
00:36:49,658 --> 00:36:53,092
I didn't want you
to favor her for me.

587
00:36:53,194 --> 00:36:56,729
I just wanted her to
stand on her own talent.

588
00:36:59,401 --> 00:37:01,835
When did you break up with Beth?

589
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:08,241
Um... Well... I don't know,
that was a while back.

590
00:37:13,615 --> 00:37:15,599
I thought you
would've called me.

591
00:37:19,037 --> 00:37:23,306
- Oh, God.
- What?

592
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:26,042
I guess it really
was all in my head.

593
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:31,014
- What? What was in your head?
- Nothing. Nothing! I just...

594
00:37:31,116 --> 00:37:35,551
I... I... I always thought that if
you and Beth ever broke up,

595
00:37:35,654 --> 00:37:39,422
that I... I just... I thought
that you would call me.

596
00:37:46,231 --> 00:37:49,666
- Teddy...
- It's OK, Owen.

597
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:55,204
It's OK. I clearly made
up this whole story.

598
00:37:55,306 --> 00:37:58,675
I mean, it was... It
was a good story.

599
00:37:58,777 --> 00:38:02,912
It was all tortured and
<i>Bridges of Madison County.</i>

600
00:38:03,014 --> 00:38:04,397
And...

601
00:38:09,671 --> 00:38:11,370
It's all right. I...

602
00:38:12,307 --> 00:38:14,841
Now I know, and...

603
00:38:14,943 --> 00:38:16,776
I can...

604
00:38:19,114 --> 00:38:21,347
I can let that story go.

605
00:38:26,171 --> 00:38:27,770
Good night.

606
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,587
Hey!

607
00:38:46,424 --> 00:38:51,528
Mmmm! Thank you for my present.

608
00:38:53,298 --> 00:38:57,066
And I'll try to get over
the birds on the scrub cap.

609
00:38:58,436 --> 00:39:01,337
Teddy's best friend,
she was this bird person.

610
00:39:01,439 --> 00:39:03,906
- She loved birds.
- Really?

611
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:05,475
And...

612
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:09,279
Well, she died in
the second tower.

613
00:39:11,916 --> 00:39:14,950
That's why Teddy gave up her
attending position at Columbia

614
00:39:15,053 --> 00:39:16,769
and she joined the Army.

615
00:39:20,959 --> 00:39:23,893
I told you she'd surprise you.

616
00:39:26,798 --> 00:39:29,615
Thank you.

617
00:39:29,717 --> 00:39:33,386
<i>Sometimes, the past is
something you just can't let go of.</i>

618
00:39:40,728 --> 00:39:42,828
I think she'll be back.

619
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:46,699
<i>And sometimes the past is
something we'll do anything to forget.</i>

620
00:39:50,021 --> 00:39:51,588
You want to keep drinking?

621
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:03,566
Another club soda, Joe?

622
00:40:06,254 --> 00:40:09,406
You're going home after
this or back to the hospital?

623
00:40:11,743 --> 00:40:14,143
Another club soda, then home.

624
00:40:16,531 --> 00:40:18,631
I'm gonna need your keys.

625
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:41,940
I'll call you a cab
when you're ready.

626
00:40:46,494 --> 00:40:49,073
<i>- Richard's not - Talking to me.
- What? Why?</i>

627
00:40:49,097 --> 00:40:50,529
<i>He's not himself.</i>

628
00:40:50,631 --> 00:40:53,166
You've been drunk a few
days. I was drunk for years.

629
00:40:53,268 --> 00:40:54,567
<i>What happened?</i>

630
00:40:54,669 --> 00:40:56,747
<i>There was a time you would
have convinced me to do this.</i>

631
00:40:56,771 --> 00:40:59,538
Now your first instinct is
no? What happened to you?

632
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:01,719
For every miscalculation
you think you see,

633
00:41:01,743 --> 00:41:05,111
there have been a hundred things
I've gotten right, and no one knows.

634
00:41:05,213 --> 00:41:10,216
<i>There is no one who understands
and cares more about Seattle Grace...</i>

635
00:41:10,318 --> 00:41:12,785
I'm still the chief of
surgery at this hospital.

636
00:41:12,904 --> 00:41:14,069
Then start acting like it!

637
00:41:14,172 --> 00:41:16,005
<i>You have a disease, Thatcher.</i>

638
00:41:16,090 --> 00:41:19,124
When you're in
it, you can't stop.

639
00:41:19,226 --> 00:41:23,078
That has been the system that
has been in place since this merger.

640
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:25,147
- Your system.
- You're fired.

641
00:41:25,249 --> 00:41:28,184
Immediately. Get the
hell out of my hospital.

642
00:41:28,286 --> 00:41:32,655
<i>Please don't do this to me.
I don't have anything left.</i>

643
00:41:32,757 --> 00:41:36,508
<i>- Please...
- - It seems that you may have</i>

644
00:41:36,610 --> 00:41:39,628
<i>accidentally clipped
the common bile duct.</i>

645
00:41:55,863 --> 00:41:59,516
<i>And sometimes we learn
something new about the past...</i>

646
00:42:02,236 --> 00:42:04,736
<i>that changes
everything we know...</i>

647
00:42:09,494 --> 00:42:11,494
<i>about the present.</i>
