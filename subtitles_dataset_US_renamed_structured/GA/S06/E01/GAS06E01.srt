1
00:00:03,737 --> 00:00:05,548
<i>According to
Elisabeth Kubler-Ross,</i>

2
00:00:05,572 --> 00:00:09,441
<i>when we are dying or have
suffered a catastrophic loss,</i>

3
00:00:09,543 --> 00:00:12,378
<i>we all move through
five distinct stages of grief.</i>

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,130
<i>We go into denial.</i>

5
00:00:15,232 --> 00:00:16,514
Push another amp...

6
00:00:16,616 --> 00:00:18,678
<i>Because the loss
is so unthinkable</i>

7
00:00:18,702 --> 00:00:20,836
<i>we can't imagine it's true.</i>

8
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:22,738
Clear!

9
00:00:22,839 --> 00:00:24,839
<i>We become angry with everyone,</i>

10
00:00:24,941 --> 00:00:29,294
<i>angry with survivors, angry
with ourselves, then we bargain.</i>

11
00:00:29,396 --> 00:00:32,697
Damn, O'Malley,
come on. Live, just live.

12
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:33,882
His ICP's 30.

13
00:00:33,984 --> 00:00:35,662
Push 70 of Mannitol,
start bagging.

14
00:00:35,686 --> 00:00:37,119
His brainstem.

15
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:42,341
<i>We beg, we plead. We
offer everything we have.</i>

16
00:00:42,443 --> 00:00:47,780
<i>We offer up our souls, in
exchange for just one more day.</i>

17
00:00:50,334 --> 00:00:53,468
Stevens! Can you hear me?

18
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:56,872
Look at me, Stevens.

19
00:00:59,076 --> 00:01:00,692
Damn it.

20
00:01:03,196 --> 00:01:04,996
<i>When the bargaining has failed,</i>

21
00:01:05,098 --> 00:01:07,399
<i>and the anger is
too hard to maintain,</i>

22
00:01:07,501 --> 00:01:11,269
<i>we fall into
depression, despair,</i>

23
00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:16,625
<i>until finally we have to accept that
we have done everything we can.</i>

24
00:01:16,726 --> 00:01:18,877
<i>We let go.</i>

25
00:01:19,896 --> 00:01:23,464
<i>We let go and move
into acceptance.</i>

26
00:01:28,622 --> 00:01:30,722
Anybody know if he's a donor?

27
00:01:38,165 --> 00:01:39,445
Oh, God!

28
00:01:46,423 --> 00:01:48,840
Whoa, whoa. She wants
it out. Can we take it out?

29
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:51,977
- She's breathing over the vent.
- Let's pull out the tube.

30
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,880
Dr. Bailey.

31
00:02:01,972 --> 00:02:06,107
Slow down. It's OK, slow down.

32
00:02:21,174 --> 00:02:24,476
His ICP went through the
roof. We did everything.

33
00:02:25,212 --> 00:02:26,578
Everything.

34
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,864
Chief, his organs are viable
for now, but it won't be long

35
00:02:29,966 --> 00:02:32,867
until he's acidotic
and hypothermic.

36
00:02:33,937 --> 00:02:35,336
Is he a donor?

37
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:42,294
Um... I don't know.

38
00:02:42,396 --> 00:02:44,579
I called his mother.
She's on her way.

39
00:02:44,681 --> 00:02:48,483
Let's close him up and get him to
the ICU in case she wants to see him.

40
00:02:58,996 --> 00:03:01,046
- Who's George?
- What?

41
00:03:01,148 --> 00:03:03,977
John Doe, the guy who threw me
out of the way of the bus, saved my life.

42
00:03:04,001 --> 00:03:08,403
Everyone's crying and saying,
"John Doe is George." Who's George?

43
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:14,242
- You can't tell her.
- Alex.

44
00:03:14,344 --> 00:03:17,295
She coded in my arms.
Out of nowhere, she died.

45
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:20,481
Just... I'll tell her.

46
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:22,967
I'll tell her when
she gets stronger.

47
00:03:23,771 --> 00:03:25,286
Alex.

48
00:03:29,476 --> 00:03:31,092
You OK?

49
00:03:31,928 --> 00:03:35,463
I had... a dream.

50
00:03:37,167 --> 00:03:40,501
- He was in his uniform.
- What?

51
00:03:40,603 --> 00:03:43,738
George is gonna die in the
Army if we don't stop him.

52
00:03:45,074 --> 00:03:47,892
Hand me my phone.
I need my phone.

53
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,394
Who said that was George?
Why do we think that's George?

54
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:08,463
Meredith said...

55
00:04:09,733 --> 00:04:11,432
I don't know.

56
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:16,054
That's not George.

57
00:04:19,042 --> 00:04:22,009
Look at his feet,
look how tall he is.

58
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:24,963
That's not George.

59
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:34,906
He wrote in my hand.

60
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:37,609
- What do you mean he wrote?
- What did he do?

61
00:04:37,711 --> 00:04:41,479
He grabbed my hand and squeezed
it and he wrote with his finger.

62
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:44,799
- Wrote with his finger?
- In my hand, he wrote
"Double O Seven."

63
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:48,036
Well, give...

64
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:53,225
- OK, what'd I write?
- "Joe."

65
00:04:53,327 --> 00:04:56,510
- No! No, I did not write "Joe"!
- Are you serious?

66
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,892
- You mean this
may not be O'Malley?
- This is funny.

67
00:04:58,916 --> 00:05:01,883
Did anyone try and call O'Malley?
Can we get him on the phone?

68
00:05:01,985 --> 00:05:04,152
I'm telling you, he
squeezed my hand.

69
00:05:04,254 --> 00:05:06,174
Shut it. You don't
get to talk anymore,

70
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:07,683
you don't get to
talk ever again.

71
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:08,802
I could've sworn it was George.

72
00:05:08,826 --> 00:05:10,670
- I got voicemail.
- He's not answering.

73
00:05:10,694 --> 00:05:12,205
He has a freckle
in his right hand,

74
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:13,728
it's shaped like Texas.

75
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:15,797
I used to tease him about it.

76
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:18,199
I'll check.

77
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:02,343
You people, answer your pages.

78
00:06:07,217 --> 00:06:09,684
George O'Malley jumped
in front of a bus today.

79
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:13,021
He knew what he was
doing and he did it anyway,

80
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:15,223
and he did it to save a life.

81
00:06:15,325 --> 00:06:18,410
So I'm not gonna allow
you doctors to stand here.

82
00:06:18,512 --> 00:06:22,914
There are lives on the line,
there are lives we can save.

83
00:06:23,016 --> 00:06:25,917
So if George O'Malley
can jump in front of a bus...

84
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,020
we can answer our damn pages.

85
00:06:29,907 --> 00:06:31,656
So let's go.

86
00:06:49,225 --> 00:06:52,244
Damn it. Damn it, O'Malley.

87
00:06:57,384 --> 00:06:59,424
How long ago did the pain start?

88
00:06:59,486 --> 00:07:01,519
I don't know. A few weeks.

89
00:07:01,622 --> 00:07:02,954
Growing pains.

90
00:07:03,056 --> 00:07:05,873
I took him to see our
doctor. He's a bad doctor.

91
00:07:05,975 --> 00:07:08,376
He stands there texting
while I'm talking to him.

92
00:07:08,478 --> 00:07:11,045
He diagnosed Andy
with growing pains.

93
00:07:11,147 --> 00:07:13,014
You know, I grew
up, and growing pains

94
00:07:13,116 --> 00:07:15,233
did not cause me to fall
down on the soccer field.

95
00:07:15,335 --> 00:07:16,812
Mom, you're being
a little dramatic.

96
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:19,420
Your pain is
dramatic to me, Andy.

97
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:21,807
Your mom's right. It's a
good thing that you came.

98
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:25,493
OK. Thanks,
because it does hurt.

99
00:07:25,595 --> 00:07:26,978
Everything hurts, all the time.

100
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,758
OK. I'm gonna give
you a quick exam.

101
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:30,862
Let me know if the
pain gets worse.

102
00:07:36,023 --> 00:07:37,756
This doesn't feel real.

103
00:07:37,858 --> 00:07:42,110
- Does this feel real to you?
- No. I don't know.

104
00:07:44,998 --> 00:07:46,414
Oh, crap.

105
00:07:46,516 --> 00:07:49,316
I don't want... I can't.

106
00:07:49,419 --> 00:07:53,321
Uh-uh. Don't look away, now.
Come on, you can walk over to her.

107
00:07:55,659 --> 00:07:59,377
- Mrs. O'Malley, I'm so sorry.
- You were his wife.

108
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:02,580
In God's eyes
you're still his wife.

109
00:08:02,682 --> 00:08:05,066
You should decide about
his organs. You decide.

110
00:08:05,168 --> 00:08:07,713
- But... Uh, um...
- I can't do it, Callie.

111
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:10,272
I can't do it. You understand?

112
00:08:10,374 --> 00:08:14,643
Ronnie and Jerry are off on
some fishing expedition in Alaska,

113
00:08:14,745 --> 00:08:18,813
and they're gonna come home
and I have to tell them that Georgie...

114
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:21,666
That's all I can
do. It's all I can...

115
00:08:21,768 --> 00:08:23,501
I can't.

116
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:28,039
I... I can't even see
him like this, I can't.

117
00:08:28,141 --> 00:08:32,961
You need to do this for
me. Can you do this for me?

118
00:08:50,397 --> 00:08:52,613
Speedboat accident,
19-year-old female.

119
00:08:52,715 --> 00:08:55,183
Lost vitals twice, but
BP's holding in the low 80s.

120
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:56,846
Both arms amputated
at the scene,

121
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,298
right leg's hanging
on by a thread.

122
00:08:58,322 --> 00:08:59,598
You recover either of the arms?

123
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:01,450
Probably at the
bottom of Puget Sound.

124
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:03,753
She was thrown from the boat
and got pulled into the propellers.

125
00:09:03,777 --> 00:09:05,054
She needs more
access, bleeding out.

126
00:09:05,078 --> 00:09:06,578
Get a central line
in her. Let's go!

127
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,425
Type and cross her and get
as much O-neg as possible.

128
00:09:09,449 --> 00:09:11,583
Wait! I found them!

129
00:09:11,685 --> 00:09:13,350
I found them! Her arms!

130
00:09:13,453 --> 00:09:15,470
They were on the boat with her.

131
00:09:15,572 --> 00:09:17,856
I found them in the water.
You have to take them.

132
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:21,542
They were just
floating in the water.

133
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:23,189
You can sew them back on, right?

134
00:09:23,213 --> 00:09:24,612
We'll do everything we can.

135
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:26,814
Oh, my God, Jojo.

136
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:28,499
That was so gross.

137
00:09:28,602 --> 00:09:30,413
Jasmine, you
just saved her life.

138
00:09:30,437 --> 00:09:32,070
You think?

139
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:38,743
I'm so sorry. I just heard.
I don't know what to say.

140
00:09:38,845 --> 00:09:41,029
Go home. You need to go home.

141
00:09:41,131 --> 00:09:44,432
You need to cry
and scream and...

142
00:09:44,534 --> 00:09:47,018
When my brother
died I ate donuts.

143
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,401
I ate a lot of donuts and
that helped some, but...

144
00:09:49,439 --> 00:09:52,473
God, I don't know what to say.

145
00:09:52,575 --> 00:09:55,060
His mom wants me to
decide about his organs.

146
00:09:55,162 --> 00:09:56,811
He lost his wallet
in the accident.

147
00:09:56,913 --> 00:09:59,713
They don't know if he's a donor.
His mom wants me to decide.

148
00:09:59,815 --> 00:10:04,035
I can't. I can't tell her
no, but I can't decide.

149
00:10:04,137 --> 00:10:06,120
I mean, we were only
married for a few months...

150
00:10:06,223 --> 00:10:09,490
OK, but during those months,

151
00:10:09,592 --> 00:10:12,710
you were the most important
person in George's life.

152
00:10:14,681 --> 00:10:16,181
No.

153
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,916
No, I wasn't.

154
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:24,272
I'm sorry. OK, so let's
take a look at the X-rays.

155
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:26,686
Do I need to take my
son to another hospital?

156
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:27,858
What?

157
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,211
That doctor's hands are shaking

158
00:10:30,313 --> 00:10:32,275
as he tries to stick
my son with a needle,

159
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:34,332
and those nurses are crying.

160
00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:37,035
You and your friend... What
the hell is going on here?

161
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:39,487
There was an accident,
and one of our people died.

162
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:49,514
Andy is my person.
He's my only person,

163
00:10:49,616 --> 00:10:52,517
and something is wrong with him.

164
00:10:52,619 --> 00:10:57,037
So what I'm asking you is, do I
need to take him somewhere else?

165
00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:00,241
No. No.

166
00:11:01,711 --> 00:11:06,831
I'll make Andy my person, OK?
I'll make Andy my person too.

167
00:11:10,821 --> 00:11:12,586
- I didn't tell her, OK?
- Karev.

168
00:11:12,688 --> 00:11:14,322
Look, we just ignored her DNR.

169
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:17,875
Her kidneys quit and she
coded. She was freakin' intubated!

170
00:11:17,977 --> 00:11:19,027
She's not strong enough.

171
00:11:19,129 --> 00:11:21,278
- What's her BUN?
- Fifteen.

172
00:11:21,381 --> 00:11:23,981
- And her creatinine?
- One-point-five.

173
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:26,362
She's strong enough.
You have to tell her.

174
00:11:26,386 --> 00:11:28,887
- Why? It can wait.
- No, it can't!

175
00:11:28,989 --> 00:11:31,690
It can't wait because George's
organs won't be viable for long.

176
00:11:31,792 --> 00:11:35,120
If they want to use them, they
have to do it soon. I have to decide,

177
00:11:35,144 --> 00:11:38,979
and I need Izzie to help me because
she's the one who should decide.

178
00:11:39,766 --> 00:11:42,233
She's who should decide.

179
00:11:42,335 --> 00:11:45,970
So that's one reason, and
the other reason is, Karev,

180
00:11:46,073 --> 00:11:49,774
if you let them unplug George without
giving her a chance to say goodbye...

181
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:52,309
I mean it, she will
never forgive you.

182
00:11:52,411 --> 00:11:54,311
You have to tell her.

183
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:02,481
Her pressure keeps dropping.

184
00:12:02,505 --> 00:12:04,483
Throw in an IO, get the
blood in a rapid infuser.

185
00:12:04,507 --> 00:12:07,792
These are pretty clean amputations.
We can reattach these arms.

186
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:09,911
Yay! I found them, you know.

187
00:12:10,013 --> 00:12:12,480
I'm looking at omentum.
Let's get her to an OR now!

188
00:12:12,582 --> 00:12:14,176
Does your friend
have any allergies,

189
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,650
medical condition,
on any medication?

190
00:12:16,752 --> 00:12:18,214
- She's not our friend.
- Jasmine!

191
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:20,232
We barely know her. We met
her on the plane from Sydney.

192
00:12:20,256 --> 00:12:21,696
We're backpacking,
seeing the States.

193
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:24,058
We're just traveling mates.

194
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,977
- She's really nice, though.
- Let's move!

195
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,461
Her name, can you give me that?

196
00:12:27,563 --> 00:12:29,408
- Clara.
- Mm-hm. Clara Ferguson,
I think.

197
00:12:29,432 --> 00:12:32,683
- Clara Ferguson.
- Clara, hang in there. Stay with me.

198
00:12:32,786 --> 00:12:35,503
She lives with her mum in London.
I have her backpack in my car.

199
00:12:35,605 --> 00:12:37,249
- OK, get it.
- Should we stay?

200
00:12:37,273 --> 00:12:38,757
Yes. In the waiting room.

201
00:12:38,859 --> 00:12:40,958
I'll update you when I can.

202
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,259
Dr. Shepherd.

203
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:45,039
Mr. Jennings. It's
good to see you.

204
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:47,615
- Derek, right? May I call you Derek?
- Of course.

205
00:12:47,717 --> 00:12:50,918
I understand you lost a
resident. It's sad. I'm sorry.

206
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,154
But the hospital
board is meeting soon.

207
00:12:53,256 --> 00:12:56,924
I need to know if you'd like to be the
next chief of surgery at Seattle Grace.

208
00:12:59,829 --> 00:13:02,947
George... it's me.

209
00:13:03,049 --> 00:13:07,368
You know, I pretty much
died not too long ago.

210
00:13:08,171 --> 00:13:10,871
So I need you to call me back.

211
00:13:11,424 --> 00:13:12,857
Please.

212
00:13:18,181 --> 00:13:23,134
I know. I played the cancer
card, I'm gross. Whatever.

213
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:28,088
I need to tell you something
and I need you to not panic.

214
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:30,058
I need you to keep breathing.

215
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,794
I need you to
stay alive 'cause...

216
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:39,083
I swear to God, I need
you to stay alive, all right?

217
00:13:41,003 --> 00:13:42,403
OK.

218
00:13:44,274 --> 00:13:45,973
O'Malley...

219
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:47,808
he got in an accident.

220
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:51,262
He's brain dead.

221
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,400
I'm sorry, what?

222
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:02,272
What about his heart?

223
00:14:05,812 --> 00:14:07,078
OK.

224
00:14:08,131 --> 00:14:11,566
His eyes. I know.

225
00:14:11,668 --> 00:14:14,552
Don't want to imagine
him without his eyes.

226
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,563
George would give everything.

227
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,401
His skin, his eyes, he
would give everything.

228
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:47,118
I have a kid in there.

229
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,520
Fifteen years old,
previously healthy.

230
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:52,173
Has back pain bad
enough to cause vomiting.

231
00:14:52,275 --> 00:14:53,574
Can you talk it through with me

232
00:14:53,676 --> 00:14:55,509
because I can't
figure out what it is

233
00:14:55,611 --> 00:14:56,910
and I think best out loud.

234
00:14:57,013 --> 00:15:00,298
Did you not hear
about George O'Malley?

235
00:15:02,184 --> 00:15:04,785
I did. It's incredibly sad.

236
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:12,459
I cannot talk to you right
now. I cannot work right now.

237
00:15:16,783 --> 00:15:20,752
Dr. Bailey, I hear that.

238
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:22,587
And I don't mean
to be insensitive,

239
00:15:22,689 --> 00:15:25,856
but this kid, this
kid's still alive.

240
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:28,259
And I don't know what's
wrong with him, not a clue.

241
00:15:28,361 --> 00:15:32,330
So, I need you to work.

242
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:35,933
I need you to talk through this
living patient with me, Bailey.

243
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:37,685
Please.

244
00:15:44,593 --> 00:15:46,861
How's his neural exam?

245
00:15:48,831 --> 00:15:51,032
Normal.

246
00:15:51,133 --> 00:15:53,934
Could it be a
compression fracture?

247
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:56,070
Plain films and CT are negative.

248
00:15:56,172 --> 00:15:59,406
- Any congenital problems?
- None reported.

249
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:03,861
Hey.

250
00:16:05,332 --> 00:16:06,630
Hey.

251
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:10,601
- Need to go home?
- No.

252
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:12,903
- Did you eat?
- No.

253
00:16:13,006 --> 00:16:14,555
Can you eat?

254
00:16:14,657 --> 00:16:16,390
No.

255
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,340
- Did you cry?
- No.

256
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:21,929
- Maybe if you cried...
- You just...

257
00:16:22,031 --> 00:16:25,332
Just you being here is...

258
00:16:25,435 --> 00:16:28,802
Don't say anything.
Just be here, that helps.

259
00:16:32,424 --> 00:16:33,657
How are you?

260
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:38,429
- Meredith, we need you.
- OK. Excuse me.

261
00:17:02,138 --> 00:17:05,372
Amanda, you have to
go. We need the room.

262
00:17:06,476 --> 00:17:09,793
- I'm so sorry.
- I know.

263
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:13,113
I'm sorry. I'm...

264
00:17:14,317 --> 00:17:16,050
I'm so sorry.

265
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:09,637
You too, huh? Growing pains?

266
00:18:09,739 --> 00:18:11,116
You're saying this
is growing pains.

267
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:14,442
No, not just growing pains.
He has a mild case of scoliosis,

268
00:18:14,544 --> 00:18:16,443
which, combined
with the growth spurt,

269
00:18:16,545 --> 00:18:19,763
could account for the pain and
the clumsiness on the soccer field.

270
00:18:19,865 --> 00:18:21,794
We'll see if it settles in
a couple of weeks. If not,

271
00:18:21,818 --> 00:18:23,067
come back for more tests.

272
00:18:23,169 --> 00:18:24,880
Why don't you just run them now?

273
00:18:24,904 --> 00:18:26,337
Because the next set of tests

274
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:30,190
involve things like sticking
large needles into Andy's spine.

275
00:18:30,292 --> 00:18:32,526
All right, then. Heading home.

276
00:18:32,628 --> 00:18:36,347
- You're sure about this?
- No.

277
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:38,716
But I'm gonna write a
prescription for muscle relaxants.

278
00:18:38,818 --> 00:18:41,101
You know I'm here
if you need me,

279
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:44,071
which I really
hope that you won't.

280
00:18:51,947 --> 00:18:54,999
Did Torres decide about
O'Malley, about his organs?

281
00:18:55,101 --> 00:18:59,420
- I don't know.
- I'm gonna see where they are.

282
00:18:59,522 --> 00:19:03,858
Chief, look, I... I know this
is the worst possible moment,

283
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:08,045
but... we need to talk.

284
00:19:13,703 --> 00:19:16,003
The board is planning a coup.

285
00:19:16,105 --> 00:19:18,417
They're saying that
you dropped the ball,

286
00:19:18,441 --> 00:19:21,001
that our ranking
isn't coming up.

287
00:19:22,177 --> 00:19:27,315
They wanna oust you.
They're asking me to support it.

288
00:19:27,417 --> 00:19:30,217
They're asking me to
step up to take the job.

289
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:32,469
Take my job?

290
00:19:33,689 --> 00:19:35,739
I told them I'd think about it.

291
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:38,792
I bought you some
time, but you need a plan.

292
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:44,849
Torres has made a decision.

293
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:55,926
Are you here to give an
update on the boating victim?

294
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:58,095
- Yeah. Where are...?
- They left.

295
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,191
Her friends left. They said
they had a plane to catch,

296
00:20:00,215 --> 00:20:03,684
something about a concert in Vegas
they didn't want to miss. Left her pack.

297
00:20:03,786 --> 00:20:06,854
She's got dozens of surgeries
ahead of her, if she survives.

298
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:10,123
When she needs
a support system...

299
00:20:10,225 --> 00:20:13,627
OK, until we find her
family, you're it. Keep that.

300
00:20:13,746 --> 00:20:18,532
I'm sorry, you want... You're
ordering me to be her friend?

301
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:22,036
She's gonna wake up in a lot
of pain, missing one of her legs,

302
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:23,970
and unable to use
either of her arms.

303
00:20:24,072 --> 00:20:26,490
So, yes, I'm ordering
you to be her friend

304
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:29,059
'cause I'm sure as
hell not gonna do it.

305
00:20:36,836 --> 00:20:38,502
I'm heading back to surgery.

306
00:20:48,013 --> 00:20:50,214
Patient is George O'Malley, 29.

307
00:20:50,316 --> 00:20:52,883
Procedure is organ
recovery for donation.

308
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:55,903
I will call on the
receiving surgeons.

309
00:20:56,455 --> 00:20:57,788
Kidneys.

310
00:20:57,890 --> 00:20:59,991
St. Luke's Children's. Boise.

311
00:21:00,093 --> 00:21:01,653
- Who's it for?
- Sorry?

312
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:05,796
- Who are his kidneys for?
- I gave all that to the nurse.

313
00:21:05,898 --> 00:21:07,614
I would like you to tell me.

314
00:21:14,507 --> 00:21:17,174
Molly Kemper, eight years old.

315
00:21:17,277 --> 00:21:19,459
Hypoplastic kidneys.

316
00:21:25,535 --> 00:21:27,050
Thank you.

317
00:21:28,521 --> 00:21:29,854
Lungs.

318
00:21:29,956 --> 00:21:32,223
Lungs and heart are going
to Portland Medical Center.

319
00:21:32,325 --> 00:21:36,444
Terry Class, age
22. Cystic fibrosis.

320
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:40,013
Liver.

321
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,913
Whoa.

322
00:21:56,015 --> 00:21:58,698
You are evil. You are the devil.

323
00:21:58,801 --> 00:22:01,835
- I am, I admit it.
- Cristina, you know the rules.

324
00:22:01,938 --> 00:22:03,503
The rules are stupid.

325
00:22:03,605 --> 00:22:05,925
Are you saying
my shrink is stupid?

326
00:22:06,175 --> 00:22:07,741
I'm saying she's a prude.

327
00:22:07,843 --> 00:22:10,628
- She's prudey and misguided.
- Mm-hmm.

328
00:22:12,181 --> 00:22:14,159
She wants us to get
to know each other.

329
00:22:14,183 --> 00:22:16,594
She wants me to keep
getting to know myself.

330
00:22:16,618 --> 00:22:19,953
She does not want me
burying myself in you.

331
00:22:20,055 --> 00:22:22,206
And if we start to have sex...

332
00:22:22,308 --> 00:22:25,042
I'll bury myself in you.

333
00:22:25,144 --> 00:22:28,612
- Oh, now who's evil?
- It's not gonna be
too much longer.

334
00:22:29,898 --> 00:22:32,866
You want me to
quit therapy? Hmm?

335
00:22:32,969 --> 00:22:35,102
- No. Crap.
- Mm-hm.

336
00:22:35,204 --> 00:22:37,182
All right. We have to go to
O'Malley's funeral anyway.

337
00:22:37,206 --> 00:22:39,251
No. I hate funerals.
Let's skip it.

338
00:22:39,275 --> 00:22:42,642
We can push up Ceviche's
débridement. That's a good excuse.

339
00:22:42,744 --> 00:22:45,629
- Ceviche?
- Chopped-up fish.

340
00:22:45,731 --> 00:22:49,383
- Propeller accident. Ceviche. Funny.
- Right. It's sick.

341
00:22:49,485 --> 00:22:52,352
- That's what makes it funny.
- We're going to the funeral. Come on.

342
00:22:52,455 --> 00:22:55,822
"Then all these unicycle boys
with wings carried us on a platform

343
00:22:55,924 --> 00:22:58,559
like we were Cleopatra
or something. Hilarious."

344
00:22:58,661 --> 00:23:01,495
I can't believe they went
to Burning Man. Hags.

345
00:23:01,597 --> 00:23:04,098
They never even
heard of Burning Man.

346
00:23:08,788 --> 00:23:10,554
I hate them.

347
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:12,723
I hate them!

348
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:16,977
Clara... forget them.

349
00:23:17,079 --> 00:23:21,648
OK? They're morons.
They're... Just think about today.

350
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:24,118
OK, the fact that
today you're gonna get

351
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:26,353
what we believe is
your final débridement.

352
00:23:26,455 --> 00:23:29,951
After that we'll get the physical
therapist here to get your arm moving.

353
00:23:29,975 --> 00:23:34,044
I'm gonna save this
piece for you to do.

354
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:36,997
- Thanks.
- Now I'm gonna ask you
one more time.

355
00:23:37,099 --> 00:23:39,450
- No.
- Don't you want to
call your mom...

356
00:23:39,552 --> 00:23:41,334
- No.
- Before your next surgery?

357
00:23:41,436 --> 00:23:43,637
No. Not yet.

358
00:23:43,739 --> 00:23:46,356
But we could write
her another e-mail.

359
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:47,986
Will it make you
late for your funeral?

360
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:50,277
No. No.

361
00:23:55,635 --> 00:23:58,668
Hi, Mum. I hope you're well.

362
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:03,607
Aside from the heat and the
smell, Burning Man was amazing.

363
00:24:07,062 --> 00:24:09,996
There is an appointed
time for everything...

364
00:24:10,098 --> 00:24:13,167
and a time for every
affair under the heavens.

365
00:24:13,269 --> 00:24:15,552
A time to be born,

366
00:24:15,655 --> 00:24:17,271
and a time to die.

367
00:24:18,824 --> 00:24:22,092
A time to plant, and a
time to uproot the plant.

368
00:24:23,562 --> 00:24:26,429
A time to kill and
a time to heal.

369
00:24:27,867 --> 00:24:31,235
A time to tear down
and a time to build.

370
00:24:31,337 --> 00:24:33,464
- A time to weep...
- Are you OK? You want the wheelchair?

371
00:24:33,488 --> 00:24:34,855
And a time to laugh.

372
00:24:34,957 --> 00:24:38,525
A time to mourn
and a time to dance.

373
00:24:38,628 --> 00:24:40,811
A time to cast away stones,

374
00:24:40,913 --> 00:24:44,899
and a time to gather
stones together.

375
00:24:45,001 --> 00:24:47,485
A time to embrace,

376
00:24:47,587 --> 00:24:50,170
and a time to refrain
from embracing.

377
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:59,879
I'm sorry.

378
00:24:59,982 --> 00:25:02,315
- You're laughing?
- She's laughing.

379
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:06,269
George... George is dead.

380
00:25:06,371 --> 00:25:08,622
He's dead. They're about
to put him in the ground

381
00:25:08,724 --> 00:25:11,775
and the priest is doing
classic rock lyrics,

382
00:25:11,877 --> 00:25:13,359
and that girl, that redhead,

383
00:25:13,462 --> 00:25:15,190
is crying harder
than his mother.

384
00:25:15,214 --> 00:25:17,180
And she never even met him.

385
00:25:17,282 --> 00:25:20,367
You are far more twisted
than I ever realized.

386
00:25:20,469 --> 00:25:23,720
And you got
married on a Post-It.

387
00:25:27,242 --> 00:25:29,287
I got married on
a Post-It. I did.

388
00:25:29,311 --> 00:25:32,612
- And you guys got married for real.
- - I know!

389
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:38,452
And I got cancer! What?!

390
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:41,521
O'Malley got hit by a bus.

391
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,401
She never stops crying.

392
00:26:38,213 --> 00:26:39,913
Not now, please. Not now.

393
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:41,960
It's been a week.
You've been avoiding me.

394
00:26:41,984 --> 00:26:44,802
- Not now.
- I am buying you time.

395
00:26:44,904 --> 00:26:45,947
I am buying you time.

396
00:26:45,971 --> 00:26:49,006
You have no idea
what I've given.

397
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:51,775
You have no idea
what I have sacrificed.

398
00:26:51,877 --> 00:26:54,895
For every miscalculation
you think you see,

399
00:26:54,997 --> 00:26:57,898
there have been a hundred
things that I have gotten right,

400
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,701
and no one knows.

401
00:27:00,803 --> 00:27:02,803
Look, I'm on your side, OK?

402
00:27:02,905 --> 00:27:05,672
I'm not the board.
I'm not Jennings.

403
00:27:05,774 --> 00:27:07,357
Then back off, then.

404
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:11,194
Just back off and
give me time to think.

405
00:27:12,564 --> 00:27:14,331
Let me have a minute to...

406
00:27:15,251 --> 00:27:17,450
O'Malley was my intern.

407
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:20,420
And I'm trying to
just take a minute.

408
00:27:22,625 --> 00:27:24,708
So, Derek, please...

409
00:27:25,844 --> 00:27:27,644
back off.

410
00:27:57,059 --> 00:27:58,758
You want a ride home?

411
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:01,611
I was gonna clean
out his locker.

412
00:28:01,714 --> 00:28:03,797
Give his stuff to
his mom, but...

413
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:10,370
I was a bad friend. To George.

414
00:28:10,472 --> 00:28:13,307
I was about as good a friend
to him as Clara's friends,

415
00:28:13,409 --> 00:28:15,553
who keep sending
postcards from the trip

416
00:28:15,577 --> 00:28:17,555
that she'll never get to take.

417
00:28:17,579 --> 00:28:19,612
I just... I...

418
00:28:19,714 --> 00:28:21,915
I abandoned him completely.

419
00:28:22,017 --> 00:28:27,387
I just moved out and
stopped talking to him and...

420
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:30,724
Why? Because he
didn't think I was as hot

421
00:28:30,826 --> 00:28:31,725
as I thought he was?

422
00:28:31,827 --> 00:28:34,961
Because he didn't love me back?

423
00:28:37,983 --> 00:28:42,586
This may be bad
timing, but I gotta ask.

424
00:28:43,271 --> 00:28:46,189
What did that guy have?

425
00:28:46,292 --> 00:28:48,325
I mean, he wasn't
much to look at,

426
00:28:48,427 --> 00:28:53,130
but... you and
Stevens and Torres?

427
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:59,002
Tell the truth. Was
he, you know...

428
00:28:59,471 --> 00:29:00,721
hung?

429
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:06,893
- That's...
- I know, I said bad timing.

430
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:09,563
But seriously, he was
kind of a dorky little dude.

431
00:29:09,665 --> 00:29:12,416
- Stop! Stop talking!
- Sorry, sorry.

432
00:29:13,985 --> 00:29:17,921
He... He died. I...

433
00:29:19,241 --> 00:29:21,141
George died.

434
00:29:22,578 --> 00:29:24,278
Yeah.

435
00:29:38,527 --> 00:29:41,161
OK. Any pain here?

436
00:29:41,263 --> 00:29:42,746
All right, take a deep breath.

437
00:29:42,848 --> 00:29:45,665
Any dizziness when you
stood up? Take a deep breath.

438
00:29:47,036 --> 00:29:49,019
- No.
- OK.

439
00:29:49,655 --> 00:29:52,689
You are going home.

440
00:29:52,792 --> 00:29:56,994
You are gonna come back in
12 days for another round of IL-2

441
00:29:57,096 --> 00:30:00,164
and then you have your
PET scan two weeks after that,

442
00:30:00,266 --> 00:30:04,468
but there's no need for
you to keep living in this bed.

443
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:06,770
You should take it easy.

444
00:30:06,872 --> 00:30:08,805
You're still a cancer patient,

445
00:30:08,907 --> 00:30:11,758
but you're no longer
a surgical patient.

446
00:30:14,697 --> 00:30:16,563
Thank you, Dr. Bailey.

447
00:30:21,487 --> 00:30:23,786
I don't know how to...

448
00:30:24,422 --> 00:30:26,873
Thank you.

449
00:30:26,975 --> 00:30:31,261
Don't forget to sign the
discharge papers before you leave.

450
00:30:35,551 --> 00:30:36,617
Andy?

451
00:30:36,719 --> 00:30:38,396
He's got serious pain
in his inguinal area,

452
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,287
down his legs and lower back.

453
00:30:40,389 --> 00:30:41,633
He's got a temp of 101.

454
00:30:41,657 --> 00:30:43,535
His mom says he's
been throwing up all night.

455
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:46,826
Please don't tell me this is
growing pains, Dr. Robbins.

456
00:30:58,907 --> 00:31:01,624
- I can't do it.
- It's OK.

457
00:31:01,726 --> 00:31:03,026
I can't move it at all.

458
00:31:03,128 --> 00:31:05,178
It's only been three days
since your last surgery.

459
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,191
The swelling will come
down. We'll keep trying.

460
00:31:07,215 --> 00:31:08,748
You're doing great.

461
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:11,068
Right. Great.

462
00:31:12,104 --> 00:31:13,814
So, where did we leave off?

463
00:31:13,838 --> 00:31:16,656
- The Grand Canyon?
- Yeah.

464
00:31:16,758 --> 00:31:19,409
Big, gorgeous
hole in the ground.

465
00:31:19,511 --> 00:31:23,130
OK. Miss you, Mum.

466
00:31:23,231 --> 00:31:25,932
- Uh, wish you could see it.
- Clara... Sorry.

467
00:31:26,034 --> 00:31:28,785
You are doing great, but
you got a long road here.

468
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:32,689
Believe me, your mom,
she's gonna want to know.

469
00:31:32,791 --> 00:31:34,891
And she's gonna want to help.

470
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:41,448
She made me from scratch.

471
00:31:41,549 --> 00:31:43,783
That's what she always says.

472
00:31:43,903 --> 00:31:48,605
Like, when I wanted to
go skydiving, you know?

473
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:54,110
"Don't jump out of a plane, Clara.
I made that body from scratch."

474
00:31:55,347 --> 00:31:57,514
Or when I sprained my ankle.

475
00:31:57,616 --> 00:32:01,351
"Be more careful, darling. I
made that ankle from scratch."

476
00:32:06,157 --> 00:32:08,424
Miss you, Mum.

477
00:32:09,962 --> 00:32:11,478
I'm doing great.

478
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:16,749
Love you, Clara.

479
00:32:30,248 --> 00:32:31,531
Come in.

480
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:36,102
Hello, Dr. Torres.

481
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:39,455
Chief, I was just...

482
00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:41,775
I was just wondering.

483
00:32:41,877 --> 00:32:43,409
I haven't heard anything about

484
00:32:43,511 --> 00:32:47,213
my application
for attending, so...

485
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:51,752
Dr. Torres, Dr. Chang's
401k took a hit.

486
00:32:51,854 --> 00:32:54,254
He's putting off retirement
another year or two.

487
00:32:54,356 --> 00:32:58,342
So... So, what, you're
not giving me the job?

488
00:32:59,244 --> 00:33:01,628
There is no job. Not this year.

489
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:04,748
I'm sorry. I assumed you heard.

490
00:33:06,568 --> 00:33:09,635
OK. Dr. Chang is
basically a figurehead.

491
00:33:09,737 --> 00:33:10,831
You're clear on that, right?

492
00:33:10,855 --> 00:33:12,823
When people want
the best, they page me.

493
00:33:12,925 --> 00:33:15,575
I have basically been running
Dr. Chang's department...

494
00:33:15,677 --> 00:33:17,655
Dr. Chang has an
impeccable record!

495
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:20,880
- He is a dinosaur!
- And so am I!

496
00:33:23,185 --> 00:33:24,817
You're...

497
00:33:25,587 --> 00:33:27,954
This is...

498
00:33:28,056 --> 00:33:30,890
- You're gonna regret this.
- Dr. Torres...

499
00:33:30,992 --> 00:33:33,593
No! No, no. I am just...

500
00:33:34,629 --> 00:33:36,296
No, I am excellent!

501
00:33:36,398 --> 00:33:38,278
I am excellent, and
any other hospital

502
00:33:38,333 --> 00:33:40,233
would be thrilled to have me.

503
00:33:40,335 --> 00:33:41,562
I'm flattered for
the offer, Larry,

504
00:33:41,586 --> 00:33:43,787
and I'm seriously
considering it.

505
00:33:43,889 --> 00:33:46,089
But it's complicated and
I need a little more time.

506
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:48,403
I can't give you
more time, Derek.

507
00:33:48,427 --> 00:33:51,111
I can give you more
money, better benefits,

508
00:33:51,212 --> 00:33:53,692
and a whole lot of press.
That's what I can give you.

509
00:33:53,765 --> 00:33:56,661
- But I can't give you much more time.
- - Yes, I am.

510
00:33:56,685 --> 00:34:00,036
I'm a superstar, a
superstar with a scalpel!

511
00:34:00,138 --> 00:34:02,038
- Torres!
- No! Don't say my name.

512
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,784
I am too big a star for
you to say my name.

513
00:34:03,808 --> 00:34:06,020
I build arms out of nothing

514
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:07,510
and legs like God.

515
00:34:07,612 --> 00:34:10,781
And when I win the Harper Avery
and every other prize there is,

516
00:34:10,883 --> 00:34:13,633
you will rue this
day, Chief Webber.

517
00:34:13,735 --> 00:34:16,136
That's right. I said "rue."

518
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:20,990
Tight ship you're
running here, Webber.

519
00:34:21,092 --> 00:34:22,392
Real tight ship.

520
00:34:58,963 --> 00:35:01,464
- Amanda. Hi.
- Hi.

521
00:35:01,566 --> 00:35:03,199
What are you doing here?

522
00:35:04,736 --> 00:35:07,537
I... can't sleep.

523
00:35:09,174 --> 00:35:14,460
I can't fall asleep, 'cause
I see his face all the time.

524
00:35:17,465 --> 00:35:20,117
I see him at bus stops.

525
00:35:20,219 --> 00:35:23,886
He was sweet,
smiling, and then...

526
00:35:23,972 --> 00:35:26,055
And then I see the
way that he ended up,

527
00:35:26,158 --> 00:35:28,724
so that even his best
friends can't recognize him

528
00:35:28,826 --> 00:35:30,160
and I can't sleep.

529
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:34,581
Can you... Can you sleep?

530
00:35:35,033 --> 00:35:37,134
I...

531
00:35:37,236 --> 00:35:40,520
am gonna write
you a prescription...

532
00:35:40,622 --> 00:35:42,633
for an anti-anxiety medication.

533
00:35:42,657 --> 00:35:45,842
And I want you to take it
because the sleep deprivation thing

534
00:35:45,944 --> 00:35:47,611
can be quite harmful.

535
00:35:55,487 --> 00:35:57,031
- Dr. Robbins.
- Chief.

536
00:35:57,055 --> 00:36:00,356
Did you order an emergent
3-D MRI for this patient?

537
00:36:00,458 --> 00:36:02,442
OK, you're mad, I see that.

538
00:36:02,544 --> 00:36:04,310
But with the patient's
mother's insurance

539
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:07,246
it could take weeks to get an
MRI and a specialty pain referral...

540
00:36:07,348 --> 00:36:10,683
So you expect the hospital
to pay with whose money?

541
00:36:10,786 --> 00:36:13,703
- Sir, I only thought...
- I don't want to hear it,
Dr. Robbins.

542
00:36:13,805 --> 00:36:16,272
Now discharge the patient,
refer him back to his physician,

543
00:36:16,374 --> 00:36:17,674
and do it now!

544
00:36:24,833 --> 00:36:27,233
Dr. Karev, change of plans.

545
00:36:33,208 --> 00:36:34,740
Open up!

546
00:36:36,812 --> 00:36:39,779
Open the door, Torres.

547
00:36:39,881 --> 00:36:42,782
Open the door, or
I'll keep knocking

548
00:36:42,884 --> 00:36:46,385
and potentially damage
my multi-million dollar hands.

549
00:36:46,487 --> 00:36:49,989
My ex-husband died.

550
00:36:50,091 --> 00:36:53,225
He died. He actually
got hit by a bus.

551
00:36:53,327 --> 00:36:57,447
George got hit by a bus, and
now I have to get a new job

552
00:36:57,549 --> 00:36:59,909
and I'm never gonna
see my friends anymore

553
00:36:59,984 --> 00:37:04,387
and Arizona keeps
bringing me donuts!

554
00:37:12,331 --> 00:37:14,080
This place for sale? It's nice.

555
00:37:16,384 --> 00:37:18,484
- What?
- Oh, nothing, nothing.

556
00:37:24,592 --> 00:37:26,392
Oh, my God!

557
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:28,155
- Hey, Derek!
- Oh, hey, hi!

558
00:37:28,179 --> 00:37:31,881
- Dude, get a room.
- On the stairs? Doesn't that hurt?

559
00:37:31,983 --> 00:37:34,049
Leave us alone, we're newlyweds.

560
00:37:34,152 --> 00:37:36,419
A Post-It wedding does
not make you newlyweds.

561
00:37:36,521 --> 00:37:39,256
You know what?
You're newlyweds, too.

562
00:37:39,358 --> 00:37:42,108
- You need your own space.
- What are these?

563
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:44,260
Keys to my trailer.
Your new home.

564
00:37:46,398 --> 00:37:47,797
Enjoy.

565
00:37:52,571 --> 00:37:54,471
- Dr. Hunt.
- Yes?

566
00:37:54,573 --> 00:37:57,390
I'm Louise O'Malley,
George's mother.

567
00:37:57,492 --> 00:38:00,610
Of course, I'm sorry.
I didn't... I'm sorry.

568
00:38:00,712 --> 00:38:02,128
It's all right.

569
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:04,714
Well, I hope you don't mind
me coming here to see you.

570
00:38:04,816 --> 00:38:07,600
I know you surgeons
are very busy people.

571
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:12,222
- My Georgie was always...
- That's no problem. It's fine.

572
00:38:12,324 --> 00:38:14,524
I'm...

573
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:18,060
having trouble. I'm...

574
00:38:18,162 --> 00:38:19,896
having trouble...

575
00:38:21,533 --> 00:38:23,933
I...

576
00:38:24,035 --> 00:38:27,887
I think it's because I'm
having trouble understanding.

577
00:38:27,989 --> 00:38:30,084
There's a piece of
the puzzle missing.

578
00:38:30,108 --> 00:38:34,076
I do better when I understand
things, how things happen.

579
00:38:35,063 --> 00:38:38,798
And George, my George...

580
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,644
The boy I knew,
the boy I raised,

581
00:38:40,668 --> 00:38:43,736
my boy, would never
have joined the Army.

582
00:38:43,838 --> 00:38:47,123
So I'm trying to understand.

583
00:38:47,225 --> 00:38:50,309
I'm trying to understand
that piece of it.

584
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:53,646
I'm trying to understand why
Georgie wasn't at work that day,

585
00:38:53,749 --> 00:38:56,082
why he was on his
way to my house

586
00:38:56,184 --> 00:39:01,187
to tell me he joined
the Army in wartime.

587
00:39:02,624 --> 00:39:05,225
I don't understand.

588
00:39:05,326 --> 00:39:08,811
And Dr. Webber said
I should talk to you.

589
00:39:12,651 --> 00:39:14,562
Mrs. O'Malley, I didn't
know him like you knew him,

590
00:39:14,586 --> 00:39:16,085
didn't know him long,

591
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:19,155
but he had tremendous
potential as a trauma surgeon.

592
00:39:19,257 --> 00:39:21,123
He was very fast on his feet.

593
00:39:21,226 --> 00:39:24,627
He could think and act
simultaneously under intense pressure.

594
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:26,996
He had tremendous potential.

595
00:39:27,665 --> 00:39:29,499
And...

596
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:34,137
He was impatient. He
wanted to become better faster.

597
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:36,406
He wanted to save more lives.

598
00:39:37,909 --> 00:39:39,409
He was good.

599
00:39:41,145 --> 00:39:43,513
And he was thoughtful
and generous.

600
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:47,366
Now, I think in
the end, I think...

601
00:39:48,136 --> 00:39:50,503
I think he was heroic and noble,

602
00:39:50,605 --> 00:39:52,755
and I liked him very much.

603
00:39:52,857 --> 00:39:58,011
And I think he gave you a good
reason to be very, very proud.

604
00:40:09,941 --> 00:40:11,808
Hey, I'm headed out.

605
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:14,243
- Just wanted to say good night.
- Good night.

606
00:40:15,697 --> 00:40:18,509
Clara, you just moved... You
moved your fingers, like you waved.

607
00:40:18,533 --> 00:40:20,917
You waved goodbye. This is huge!

608
00:40:22,687 --> 00:40:26,055
That's huge? That I waved?

609
00:40:26,891 --> 00:40:28,608
That I waved a finger?

610
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:30,292
That's my life from now on,

611
00:40:30,394 --> 00:40:32,896
that's the best I
have to hope for?

612
00:40:33,832 --> 00:40:37,434
Clara...

613
00:40:37,536 --> 00:40:40,519
Do you see that woman
out there talking to Dr. Hunt?

614
00:40:40,621 --> 00:40:44,156
We buried her son this week.

615
00:40:44,259 --> 00:40:47,343
He had an accident, like you.

616
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:52,548
He wasn't even as bad off as
you were, and he didn't make it.

617
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:55,418
Clara, I know that
it doesn't feel like it,

618
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,803
but it is a miracle
that you lived.

619
00:40:57,905 --> 00:41:02,341
It is a miracle. So you
should call your mom.

620
00:41:02,443 --> 00:41:04,944
She would want
to know the truth.

621
00:41:07,699 --> 00:41:10,500
You stupid little bitch.

622
00:41:11,836 --> 00:41:14,504
You really don't get it, do you?

623
00:41:14,606 --> 00:41:16,706
You should have let me die.

624
00:41:16,808 --> 00:41:19,875
You had no business.

625
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:24,880
I've got one working hand,
I may never walk again.

626
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:30,186
Do you think you're God?
You had no business.

627
00:41:30,288 --> 00:41:34,223
Your friend is better
off. His mum is better off.

628
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:38,962
Do you think this is a miracle?
Who wants to live like this?

629
00:41:39,063 --> 00:41:42,298
Just let me die! Just
let me die, please!

630
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,634
- Just let me die!
- Hey, Clara...

631
00:41:44,736 --> 00:41:47,870
Just let me die! Get off me!

632
00:41:47,972 --> 00:41:49,422
I need some help in here!

633
00:41:49,524 --> 00:41:53,225
- Clara, stop! You have to stop!
- Get off me!

634
00:41:58,399 --> 00:42:00,719
<i>In medical school, we
have a hundred classes</i>

635
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:03,869
<i>that teach us how
to fight off death...</i>

636
00:42:05,606 --> 00:42:08,341
<i>and not one lesson
in how to go on living.</i>
