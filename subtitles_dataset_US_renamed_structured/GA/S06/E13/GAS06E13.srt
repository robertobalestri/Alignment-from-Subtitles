1
00:00:07,057 --> 00:00:08,897
<i>We ask a lot of our patients.</i>

2
00:00:08,992 --> 00:00:11,326
<i>We put them to
sleep, cut them open,</i>

3
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:14,796
<i>poke around in their brains
and guts with sharp instruments.</i>

4
00:00:14,898 --> 00:00:18,066
<i>- We ask for their blind trust.</i>
- The blue one.

5
00:00:22,656 --> 00:00:26,257
When in doubt, always go
with blue. It brings out your eyes.

6
00:00:27,928 --> 00:00:29,511
Thanks.

7
00:00:29,613 --> 00:00:32,114
The hospital, the
staff, they love Richard.

8
00:00:32,215 --> 00:00:36,068
To them, I stabbed him in the back
to get the job. They'll be mad at me.

9
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:37,853
- Just like you are.
- I am mad.

10
00:00:37,955 --> 00:00:41,356
That doesn't mean I don't
think you'll do a great job.

11
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:43,341
I think you'll be
a very good chief.

12
00:00:43,444 --> 00:00:48,497
<i>Irony is, trust is hard for surgeons
because we're trained, from day one,</i>

13
00:00:48,599 --> 00:00:51,633
<i>that we can't trust
anyone but ourselves.</i>

14
00:00:51,735 --> 00:00:54,569
<i>The only instincts you
can count on are your own.</i>

15
00:01:01,178 --> 00:01:03,178
Either of you know what
this big meeting's about?

16
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,980
- I heard there was a coup.
- Webber's out,
Shepherd's in. True?

17
00:01:06,082 --> 00:01:07,783
- We know what you know.
- Bull.

18
00:01:07,884 --> 00:01:10,363
Your sister's married to the guy.
Expect me to believe you don't know?

19
00:01:10,387 --> 00:01:12,354
Don't you have your own
loser friends to talk to?

20
00:01:12,456 --> 00:01:14,934
Also heard Shepherd plans to clean
house. Maybe he'll start with you.

21
00:01:14,958 --> 00:01:18,026
I'm safe. The guy's my roommate. You're
the ones who should watch your backs.

22
00:01:18,128 --> 00:01:20,128
- Why? What do you know?
- Simple math.

23
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:22,342
Shepherd hates the merger.
You're from Mercy West. You're toast.

24
00:01:22,366 --> 00:01:25,206
Derek's not gonna fire people just
because they're from Mercy West.

25
00:01:25,235 --> 00:01:28,203
He's not like that.
He's loyal and fair.

26
00:01:28,305 --> 00:01:29,604
Tell that to Webber.

27
00:01:29,707 --> 00:01:31,785
<i>The only skills you can
count on are your own.</i>

28
00:01:31,809 --> 00:01:36,778
<i>Until, one day, you'll leave the
classroom and step into the OR.</i>

29
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,382
I think we've almost
got the tumor out.

30
00:01:40,484 --> 00:01:44,002
At this rate, we'll be
finished early, Grey.

31
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:46,983
You might be able to catch the
end of Shepherd's big speech.

32
00:01:47,007 --> 00:01:50,926
She's tachycardic!

33
00:01:51,028 --> 00:01:53,779
<i>You're surrounded by
others. A team of others.</i>

34
00:01:53,881 --> 00:01:57,277
I don't understand what happened.
Everything appears to be in order.

35
00:01:57,301 --> 00:02:00,001
There's no bleeders. I
don't see any bleeders.

36
00:02:00,103 --> 00:02:03,572
OK, I don't see a
reason why down here.

37
00:02:03,674 --> 00:02:06,119
So why is her heart rate
going through the roof?!

38
00:02:06,143 --> 00:02:10,412
- Check her anastomoses.
- It's intact! Everything is intact!

39
00:02:10,514 --> 00:02:15,249
What? Is...? Wait, wait,
wait. Did I just feel movement?

40
00:02:21,842 --> 00:02:24,709
She's awake. Dr. Bailey,
the patient's awake.

41
00:02:29,667 --> 00:02:32,250
<i>A team you have to rely on...</i>

42
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:42,210
<i>whether you trust them or not.</i>

43
00:02:42,312 --> 00:02:44,729
What the hell did you do?
What the hell did you do?!

44
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,714
Get her back to sleep right now!

45
00:02:46,816 --> 00:02:49,835
OK, I know you're scared
right now, but it's gonna be OK.

46
00:02:49,937 --> 00:02:53,071
Everything is going to
be OK. Just try to breathe.

47
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:54,839
Pushing 150 propofol.

48
00:03:02,466 --> 00:03:04,332
- Hey.
- Hey.

49
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:07,502
- Think he's gonna
give a big speech?
- I don't know.

50
00:03:07,605 --> 00:03:12,040
- So... about the other night...
- I don't wanna talk about it.

51
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,834
- What the hell is he wearing?
- He looks good. Chiefly.

52
00:03:22,937 --> 00:03:24,987
He looks like an undertaker.

53
00:03:25,105 --> 00:03:28,089
- I promised him we'd clap.
- Oh, now?

54
00:03:41,455 --> 00:03:44,222
I wanna thank you all for
being here. I know you're busy,

55
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:46,741
so I'll try to make this quick.
As you may have heard,

56
00:03:46,844 --> 00:03:51,313
I have been appointed the
new interim chief of surgery.

57
00:03:51,415 --> 00:03:54,816
It's my personal goal to make this
transition as smooth as possible.

58
00:03:54,918 --> 00:03:58,386
- I know we've had
a rocky few months.
- Here it comes.

59
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:00,700
- Mistakes have been made.
- He's talking about the merger.

60
00:04:00,724 --> 00:04:04,059
- Shh!
- - I intend to right those wrongs and...

61
00:04:04,161 --> 00:04:07,412
- Told ya.
- Bring this hospital back to its former glory.

62
00:04:07,514 --> 00:04:10,799
Former glory? Undertaker
needs a speech writer.

63
00:04:10,901 --> 00:04:13,635
- We are screwed.
- Yes, you are, sucker.

64
00:04:13,737 --> 00:04:16,804
- Check it out. Chief Webber.
- And, um...

65
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:24,195
What I meant... Uh...

66
00:04:24,298 --> 00:04:27,065
by that is... What I'm trying
to say is I wanna thank you

67
00:04:27,167 --> 00:04:33,288
for your support, in advance.
That's all. OK, let's get back to work.

68
00:04:49,305 --> 00:04:53,108
Avery? I need you to round up my
charts and bring them to room 2214.

69
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:55,472
Yang usually comes
in early to do that.

70
00:04:55,496 --> 00:04:58,513
Yang's not on my
service today. You are.

71
00:04:58,615 --> 00:05:00,882
Karev, I hear that
you're the future of Peds.

72
00:05:00,984 --> 00:05:02,695
- Excuse me?
- Birdie named Bailey

73
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:04,799
whispered in my ear. I want
you to work with me today

74
00:05:04,855 --> 00:05:06,366
- so I can see if she's right.
- What'd she say?

75
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:08,230
You're the best
babysitter in the hospital.

76
00:05:08,342 --> 00:05:10,625
Shut up.

77
00:05:10,728 --> 00:05:13,862
You don't think Peds is hardcore?
You can say that to my face, Avery.

78
00:05:13,964 --> 00:05:16,698
- No. No, ma'am.
- Mm-hm.

79
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,652
Don't let the roller skates fool you.
Peds is nothing but hardcore. Rounds.

80
00:05:20,754 --> 00:05:22,587
In ten.

81
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:25,623
Peds. Who's the sucker now?

82
00:05:27,711 --> 00:05:30,112
I heard that...

83
00:05:30,214 --> 00:05:32,654
Sloan was released
from the hospital in LA.

84
00:05:32,733 --> 00:05:37,135
That's good. Is she, uh...
Is she coming back soon?

85
00:05:37,237 --> 00:05:41,272
Mark? This is some kind of joke?
You're not even gonna look at me?

86
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:45,977
Torres, I have a hip decubitus
ulcer I need you to check out.

87
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,015
Mature. Really mature, Mark!

88
00:05:50,117 --> 00:05:52,600
Basically, you have two
options available to you.

89
00:05:52,702 --> 00:05:55,203
Sign these, you're agreeing
to an early retirement.

90
00:05:55,305 --> 00:05:57,105
You'll take an early pension.

91
00:05:57,207 --> 00:05:59,624
Your license to practice
medicine will no longer be valid.

92
00:05:59,709 --> 00:06:02,026
You'd walk away from this
hospital, effective immediately.

93
00:06:02,128 --> 00:06:04,646
- No strings attached.
- You're not gonna sign that.

94
00:06:04,748 --> 00:06:07,765
You're gonna sign this.

95
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:10,752
Which says that you are
voluntarily enrolling yourself

96
00:06:10,854 --> 00:06:13,321
into the Physicians
Rehabilitation Treatment Program.

97
00:06:13,423 --> 00:06:15,957
Go to rehab, Richard.
You'll sober up.

98
00:06:16,059 --> 00:06:18,893
You get out, you
have your job waiting.

99
00:06:18,995 --> 00:06:20,345
Pending board approval.

100
00:06:29,072 --> 00:06:31,472
I need some time to think.

101
00:06:34,661 --> 00:06:36,978
What is there to think about?

102
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,764
You aren't considering
quitting, are you?

103
00:06:41,585 --> 00:06:43,265
Sorry to interrupt,
but chief...?

104
00:06:43,337 --> 00:06:45,637
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

105
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:49,791
I'm sorry. Dr. Shepherd. There's a
situation that needs your attention.

106
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,778
Excuse me.

107
00:06:58,669 --> 00:06:59,712
The patient was
open on the table...

108
00:06:59,736 --> 00:07:01,136
She had appropriate anesthetic.

109
00:07:01,237 --> 00:07:03,837
- There is no way
we should be liable.
- Stop. Stop!

110
00:07:03,874 --> 00:07:07,909
- Just take a deep breath. You check on the patient.
- OK.

111
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:10,862
This can happen.
It's happened to me.

112
00:07:10,964 --> 00:07:13,280
Any luck at all, she
won't remember a thing.

113
00:07:13,383 --> 00:07:15,467
- She won't remember to sue us?
- Exactly.

114
00:07:16,953 --> 00:07:18,832
OK. How was that?
That was good, right?

115
00:07:18,856 --> 00:07:22,841
- Very chiefly. Lose the tie.
- Good. What? The tie.

116
00:07:24,511 --> 00:07:27,678
Mr. and Mrs. Wilson? We're
here to update you on the surgery.

117
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:31,716
We completed your tumor resection.
I was able to resect the entire thing

118
00:07:31,818 --> 00:07:34,452
- off of your abdominal wall.
- Which is a good thing.

119
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:36,988
- Things went very well.
- Really?

120
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:40,574
How about the part when
I woke up on the table?

121
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:44,895
How well did that part go?

122
00:07:44,998 --> 00:07:48,683
Where I could smell my own
burning flesh, how was that?

123
00:07:48,785 --> 00:07:52,337
When I was lying
there unable to speak

124
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:55,957
while I could actually feel
you butchering my insides!

125
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:59,344
I couldn't move! I was awake and
couldn't move and you had no idea!

126
00:07:59,446 --> 00:08:01,729
How well did that part go?

127
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:08,420
Here's what we do. I'm gonna
check the anesthetics themselves.

128
00:08:08,522 --> 00:08:11,689
You draw a CBC, a chem 18 and
let's do some genotyping studies.

129
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:14,742
Oh. Here's what we do?
We? Did you not hear her?

130
00:08:14,844 --> 00:08:18,929
The girl is traumatized. The only
thing we are doing is getting sued!

131
00:08:19,032 --> 00:08:21,149
- Because of you.
- Where do you even get off

132
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:24,502
speaking to me like that? You have
no idea what went wrong in that OR.

133
00:08:24,604 --> 00:08:26,871
Here's what I know. I
know that you're new here.

134
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:28,984
I know you probably still
have a chip on your shoulder

135
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:31,170
'cause your parking space
at Mercy West was better.

136
00:08:31,194 --> 00:08:35,063
And I know you're an anesthesiologist,
which means you make buckets of money

137
00:08:35,165 --> 00:08:38,099
logging reasonable
hours, sitting on your behind

138
00:08:38,201 --> 00:08:41,936
and flipping through <i>Architectural
Digest</i> while somebody on the other side

139
00:08:42,038 --> 00:08:44,217
of the curtain does the real
work, and gets sued for it.

140
00:08:44,241 --> 00:08:46,419
- Excuse me...
- I don't what
they did at Mercy West,

141
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:49,527
but here at Seattle
Grace, we expect to be able

142
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:54,132
to trust the gasman, trust him
to do his job so we can do ours.

143
00:08:54,234 --> 00:08:57,885
We expect the gasman
to stay awake at the switch,

144
00:08:57,988 --> 00:09:00,488
no matter how long and
boring a procedure might be.

145
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:05,627
We expect the gasman to stay focused
enough to keep the patient unconscious!

146
00:09:11,118 --> 00:09:13,985
How long would you say
Brad's been having the pain?

147
00:09:14,087 --> 00:09:17,605
- Off and on for months.
- - Brad, is the pain constant,

148
00:09:17,707 --> 00:09:20,091
or is it worse at
times, better at others?

149
00:09:20,193 --> 00:09:23,122
It's usually bad in the mornings,
like right after breakfast.

150
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:25,547
Which, I might point out, is
when he has to go to school.

151
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:27,999
But I feel it at
other times, too.

152
00:09:28,101 --> 00:09:30,769
Right, like when you
have a Spanish test

153
00:09:30,871 --> 00:09:33,120
or have to give a
presentation in history class.

154
00:09:33,223 --> 00:09:36,357
- Stress can exacerbate
abdominal pain.
- Please, don't encourage him.

155
00:09:36,459 --> 00:09:38,804
- He's faking
so he can miss school.
- I am not!

156
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:42,747
Abdomen's soft, non-tender,
not rigid. Bowel sounds are good.

157
00:09:42,849 --> 00:09:46,251
Still, I'd like to cover all the bases.
Dr. Karev, how would you proceed?

158
00:09:46,353 --> 00:09:49,270
- We could try
a triple contrast CT.
- Let's do it.

159
00:09:49,372 --> 00:09:52,424
Brad, this is gonna cost
us thousands of dollars

160
00:09:52,526 --> 00:09:55,543
and insurance only covers
part of it. You know that, right?

161
00:09:55,645 --> 00:09:59,214
I'm not faking it! I'm not
faking it, Dad! I swear!

162
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:10,325
Dr. Altman? I noticed
you have Avery assigned

163
00:10:10,427 --> 00:10:12,187
- to all your
surgeries this morning.
- I do.

164
00:10:12,211 --> 00:10:15,913
Um... So there's no room
for me on your service?

165
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:18,632
You've been on every one
of my cases since I've arrived.

166
00:10:18,734 --> 00:10:22,787
This is a teaching hospital. It's only
fair I give other residents a chance.

167
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:27,558
Yes, yes, of course.
I understand. Um...

168
00:10:27,661 --> 00:10:31,529
Do you think you'll have room on
your service tomorrow, or the next day?

169
00:10:31,632 --> 00:10:35,583
I... I... I don't
know. I just...

170
00:10:37,954 --> 00:10:41,356
I can't today,
Cristina, OK? I just...

171
00:10:41,457 --> 00:10:43,241
I can't.

172
00:10:46,513 --> 00:10:48,796
Um, Leslie? Hi.

173
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:51,783
This will only take a moment.
We just need to examine your...

174
00:10:51,885 --> 00:10:56,237
- Hey, careful!
- I don't want you to touch me.

175
00:10:56,339 --> 00:10:58,117
- Leslie.
- I mean it.

176
00:10:58,141 --> 00:11:00,108
Don't let her touch me.

177
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:02,644
OK, uh, I know that you've
been through a lot today,

178
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:05,546
- but if we don't check...
- I remember.

179
00:11:07,049 --> 00:11:12,036
I remember you
screaming in surgery.

180
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:14,917
- You were panicking.
- - She's getting tachycardic.

181
00:11:14,941 --> 00:11:16,368
Panicking.

182
00:11:16,392 --> 00:11:19,544
With your hand inside
my body. You just...

183
00:11:19,646 --> 00:11:22,463
Dr. Bailey, her
incision site is bleeding.

184
00:11:22,565 --> 00:11:25,500
- She ripped it open.
- I mean it! Don't touch me!

185
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:27,042
- OK!
- I don't want you to touch me!

186
00:11:27,137 --> 00:11:29,787
- Grey, redress the wound.
- Don't touch me!

187
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:32,523
Use the dressing to apply
pressure with one hand.

188
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,525
Grab as much gauze
as you can with the other.

189
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:38,179
OK. See that tape? You're
gonna need a nice, long piece.

190
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:40,181
Uh-huh.

191
00:11:44,504 --> 00:11:48,339
- Hey. Need some help?
- No. I'm good. Thanks.

192
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:51,692
- OK, never mind.
- I need to talk
to you about Mark.

193
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:54,529
- Could you not rip those?
- He isn't speaking to me.

194
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:57,332
He barely even looks at me.
And I know that we broke up,

195
00:11:57,434 --> 00:12:00,129
but we still work together and
I'm gonna be a plastic surgeon.

196
00:12:00,153 --> 00:12:03,204
- You're not gonna
be a plastic surgeon.
- Still.

197
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:04,917
OK. We're gonna have to
see each other every day.

198
00:12:04,941 --> 00:12:07,386
He's best friends with my
sister's Post-it husband.

199
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:09,822
- I don't know what to do.
- I know. He's not
exactly being fair.

200
00:12:09,846 --> 00:12:13,648
- No, he's not being fair!
- Seriously,
go easy on the cast padding.

201
00:12:13,749 --> 00:12:17,268
At least, he could be civil. I had
a one-night stand, OK? Big deal.

202
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:18,770
Right.

203
00:12:18,872 --> 00:12:21,484
- Not like he didn't
sleep with Addison.
- True. More than once.

204
00:12:21,508 --> 00:12:23,791
- What?
- Hm?

205
00:12:24,777 --> 00:12:26,694
Nothing. I didn't say anything.

206
00:12:26,796 --> 00:12:29,814
More than once? More than once?!

207
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:31,649
Ha!

208
00:12:33,769 --> 00:12:36,387
What about that?
That spot? See it?

209
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:37,889
Oh...

210
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:40,658
- That was lint.
- Doesn't make sense.

211
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,106
No kid wants to be the loser
missing class to go to the hospital,

212
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:47,415
- I don't care how lame you are.
- I loved the hospital
when I was a kid.

213
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:51,252
No school, lots of cool
medical supplies to play with.

214
00:12:52,589 --> 00:12:54,656
OK, yeah. So let's
go over it again.

215
00:12:54,757 --> 00:12:57,608
He presented with severe
but intermittent abdominal pain.

216
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:00,011
- No discernable pattern.
- Labs were normal. No fever.

217
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:04,115
- Soft abdomen on exam.
- We're missing something.

218
00:13:06,269 --> 00:13:10,171
- Chronic mesenteric ischemia.
- Ah! It's a stretch for a kid,

219
00:13:10,273 --> 00:13:12,535
- but if he had
vascular problems...
- It fits the symptoms.

220
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:14,953
- It doesn't show up
on the scans.
- But the problem is,

221
00:13:14,977 --> 00:13:16,405
the only way to get
an accurate diagnosis

222
00:13:16,429 --> 00:13:19,581
- is try an
exploratory laparoscopy.
- So?

223
00:13:19,683 --> 00:13:21,348
Brad's father didn't
want us to run a CT.

224
00:13:21,451 --> 00:13:24,285
You really think he's gonna
agree to exploratory surgery?

225
00:13:31,527 --> 00:13:33,361
Hey.

226
00:13:33,463 --> 00:13:36,475
Teddy is blackballing me. She's
not saying that's what she's doing,

227
00:13:36,499 --> 00:13:38,265
but I think that's...

228
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:50,478
I don't want to talk about Teddy.
Do you want to talk about Teddy?

229
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,146
No.

230
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:03,869
I heard he had some
kind of mental breakdown.

231
00:14:03,893 --> 00:14:07,462
- I heard it was drugs.
- No way. Prescription or...?

232
00:14:07,564 --> 00:14:10,030
Go practice medicine. Now.

233
00:14:10,133 --> 00:14:13,150
Richard. This, sitting
here, this isn't good.

234
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:16,787
This isn't helping things. Just
sign the paper, go to rehab.

235
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:19,601
- Sign the paper.
- Who the hell do
you think you are?

236
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:22,193
Who do you...?
You are not my boss.

237
00:14:22,295 --> 00:14:25,240
And you are not my chief. You may
have stolen my office out from under me...

238
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:26,925
You're in trouble and
I'm trying to help you.

239
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:28,677
I helped you! I
didn't get you fired!

240
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,696
You got fired the minute
you took your first drink!

241
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,748
- Get out of my face!
- No. You're not gonna do this.

242
00:14:32,772 --> 00:14:34,855
You're not ending your
career to get back at me.

243
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:36,857
I did what I had to
do, and nothing more.

244
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:40,127
You look me in the eye,
and you say that again.

245
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:45,816
I wanted the job.

246
00:14:48,154 --> 00:14:51,472
I wanted the job, I admit that. I
didn't want to end your career.

247
00:14:51,574 --> 00:14:55,242
Well, that part's not up to you,
is it? You did what you had to do.

248
00:14:55,344 --> 00:14:59,329
But this part is up to me.

249
00:14:59,432 --> 00:15:01,065
- So get out.
- No!

250
00:15:01,167 --> 00:15:04,835
Stop it! Both of you!
People are watching.

251
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:16,346
Get back to work.

252
00:15:40,089 --> 00:15:43,874
- The gasman
would like an apology.
- What?

253
00:15:43,976 --> 00:15:47,211
Leslie Wilson's
cytochrome P450 results.

254
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:51,315
The type she has means she
metabolizes anesthetic drugs too fast,

255
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:55,403
way more rapidly than you or me. No way
we could have known that before surgery.

256
00:15:55,505 --> 00:15:59,440
- So this is why she woke up?
- It is.

257
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:01,921
You don't have to get down
on your knees and apologize.

258
00:16:01,945 --> 00:16:05,123
But I would like something heartfelt.
Something in the neighborhood of,

259
00:16:05,147 --> 00:16:09,033
"You were right and I was
rash and kind of mean."

260
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:12,736
Maybe throw in a, "Turns
out you're a hell of a doctor."

261
00:16:14,624 --> 00:16:17,791
It wasn't our fault.
That's... That's good news.

262
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:22,663
She's gonna need a second surgery.
Her incision site won't stop bleeding.

263
00:16:22,765 --> 00:16:25,699
- She might
have internal bleeding.
- OK.

264
00:16:25,802 --> 00:16:29,770
It's not gonna be easy, but now
I know how to keep her under.

265
00:16:29,872 --> 00:16:32,807
She won't let me touch her.

266
00:16:34,276 --> 00:16:35,556
Oh.

267
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,631
I'm good with patients.

268
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:44,452
They always trust
me. I... I... I've never...

269
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:47,571
I don't even know how to...

270
00:16:48,558 --> 00:16:51,025
She won't let me touch her.

271
00:16:59,819 --> 00:17:02,387
- Why are you walking like that?
- I got a burn.

272
00:17:02,489 --> 00:17:05,322
- Where?
- Go away.

273
00:17:05,425 --> 00:17:07,085
We're both doctors. No
need to be embarrassed.

274
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:11,028
I'm not embarrassed! I'm just
waiting for Meredith. Now, go away.

275
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:14,314
- I let you treat my tick. Come on.
- This is not a tick.

276
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:18,002
Today sucks. Mark sucks.

277
00:17:18,104 --> 00:17:20,405
Yang got burns
on her girl parts.

278
00:17:20,507 --> 00:17:22,239
I do not... It's not
on my girl parts.

279
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:24,436
They're on her ass.
Look how she's walking.

280
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:27,311
- Don't you two have patients?
- How did you get
burns on your ass?

281
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:30,281
- You paged?
- Mer, come.

282
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:33,183
The rest of you, bye.

283
00:17:35,305 --> 00:17:39,323
- Oh, my God!
- Not so loud.

284
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:40,624
How did you...? What did...?

285
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:44,645
You have grate marks
burned into your ass.

286
00:17:44,747 --> 00:17:46,798
Vent marks. But same difference.

287
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:53,937
I was busy having sex. Will
you please just dress the wound?

288
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:59,410
Owen's being very caveman-like.

289
00:17:59,512 --> 00:18:04,264
It's hot, vaguely
disturbing, but mostly hot.

290
00:18:05,935 --> 00:18:09,203
I think he might still be a little
upset I offered him to Teddy.

291
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:12,317
- Alex!
- Alex!

292
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:14,070
- Hot cross buns.
- Oh! That's gonna blister.

293
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:16,171
Will you get them out of here?

294
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:18,829
Bailey's paging me. Lexie,
will you finish this for me?

295
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,309
- Oh, my God. I hate you.
- I'm
taking Alex with me.

296
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:25,136
- What?
- Let's go. Come on.

297
00:18:25,238 --> 00:18:27,354
- Ugh.
- Is this a sex injury?

298
00:18:27,456 --> 00:18:32,309
- Oh, my God.
- It is.

299
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:35,112
I used to have sex
injuries with Mark.

300
00:18:35,214 --> 00:18:38,327
Mark was really awesome at
leaving you with good sex injuries.

301
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:45,689
- Please don't cry on my ass.
- I'm sorry.

302
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,458
Please don't cry.

303
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:53,830
- Hey. Are you...?
- Busy.

304
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:58,202
Dr. Altman, I pulled
everything you asked for.

305
00:18:58,304 --> 00:19:00,855
It's here in numerical order
according to room number.

306
00:19:00,957 --> 00:19:03,641
Numerical order?

307
00:19:03,743 --> 00:19:05,609
- Is that not how...?
- It's fine.

308
00:19:05,712 --> 00:19:08,691
Yang always orders them according
to priority, most urgent to least urgent,

309
00:19:08,715 --> 00:19:14,068
but... it's fine. It'll
work. Follow me.

310
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:15,986
No. Just no.

311
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:19,334
You are not cutting open our son
with no evidence that there's anything...

312
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:21,425
- Dad.
- No! Listen to me.

313
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:24,673
That is thousands of dollars we're
talking about on what, a hunch? Huh?

314
00:19:24,697 --> 00:19:27,581
He's got a nervous stomach
and crappy grades, that's it.

315
00:19:27,683 --> 00:19:29,800
I hated school, too,
Brad. OK? I got it.

316
00:19:29,902 --> 00:19:32,502
Your mother and I, we
have jobs and we go to them.

317
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:36,290
You have school, that's your
job. No surgery. It's insane.

318
00:19:36,392 --> 00:19:38,476
Just no. No!

319
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:44,226
You think it's right for
them to take him home?

320
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,350
- It isn't.
- Shh. Brad, I'm teaching.

321
00:19:46,452 --> 00:19:48,135
- You think he's faking?
- No.

322
00:19:48,237 --> 00:19:50,332
- What are you gonna do?
- I'd like
to push his dad's face

323
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:53,607
- into a wall. No offense.
- Yeah, no, that'd be good.

324
00:19:53,709 --> 00:19:56,827
Barring physical violence, what
are you gonna do? This is Peds.

325
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:58,724
Your patients can't
advocate for themselves.

326
00:19:58,748 --> 00:20:02,333
So in addition to surgery, a big
part of the job is advocating for them.

327
00:20:02,435 --> 00:20:05,236
You think you can do that?

328
00:20:05,338 --> 00:20:07,638
Yes, this is
exploratory surgery,

329
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:10,374
and yes, Brad's scans
look clean, but if we're right,

330
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,760
if he has mesenteric ischemia
and you take him home?

331
00:20:12,862 --> 00:20:15,812
The blood flow to his
intestine will slowly stop,

332
00:20:15,898 --> 00:20:17,882
killing the tissue, causing
Brad to become septic,

333
00:20:17,984 --> 00:20:21,067
forcing his body into such intense
shock that by the time you realize

334
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:22,869
what's happening and
you call an ambulance,

335
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:26,423
the chance of Brad getting back
to the hospital alive is next to zero.

336
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:28,559
You think he's
faking? I get that.

337
00:20:28,661 --> 00:20:31,995
So the only real question
is, how sure are you?

338
00:20:32,097 --> 00:20:33,997
How sure?

339
00:20:36,669 --> 00:20:38,950
I understand your hesitation.

340
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:41,149
But we don't have a choice.
You need a second surgery.

341
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:42,851
Haven't you put her
through enough for one day?

342
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:46,377
I can make some calls, see if we can
get you transferred to another hospital.

343
00:20:46,479 --> 00:20:48,562
A transfer takes time,

344
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:52,483
and the longer we wait, she's at
greater risk for infection or blood loss.

345
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:55,530
I know you're scared. But the
dressing I did earlier is only temporary.

346
00:20:55,554 --> 00:21:00,007
- It needs to be fixed properly.
- It was like being in a coffin.

347
00:21:00,109 --> 00:21:02,793
Alive in a coffin.

348
00:21:02,895 --> 00:21:05,662
I couldn't talk,
I couldn't move.

349
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:10,200
The thought of your
hand back inside me...

350
00:21:10,303 --> 00:21:13,537
Sweetie. You don't have to do
anything you don't want to do.

351
00:21:18,494 --> 00:21:20,644
- You can do it.
- What?

352
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:22,829
You were there.

353
00:21:22,932 --> 00:21:24,631
You stayed calm.

354
00:21:24,733 --> 00:21:26,450
You were kind.

355
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:30,504
Oh. Dr. Bailey is far
more experienced.

356
00:21:30,606 --> 00:21:32,206
She's not touching me.

357
00:21:32,308 --> 00:21:35,793
You have to promise
me she won't touch me.

358
00:21:35,895 --> 00:21:37,311
You can do it.

359
00:21:40,566 --> 00:21:42,149
She can't.

360
00:21:45,487 --> 00:21:48,655
- Hey!
- Hey.

361
00:21:48,757 --> 00:21:51,603
What do you think of the present I
got from Hunt for becoming chief?

362
00:21:51,627 --> 00:21:54,761
From Hunt, huh? I was
gonna get you one of those.

363
00:21:54,863 --> 00:21:58,232
The deluxe version, the kind
that keeps score. Not, you know,

364
00:21:58,334 --> 00:21:59,928
- the cheaper one.
- That's my chair.

365
00:21:59,952 --> 00:22:01,872
I know. I like it. It
makes me feel powerful.

366
00:22:01,971 --> 00:22:04,287
That was quite a scene in
the conference room earlier.

367
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:06,356
- You saw that.
- The whole hospital did.

368
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:09,609
What happened there? How'd
you dethrone the chief? And why?

369
00:22:09,711 --> 00:22:11,490
- I can't talk about it.
- Not even to me?

370
00:22:11,514 --> 00:22:15,682
- It's not my story to tell.
- Heads up.

371
00:22:15,784 --> 00:22:18,135
Looks like I'm facing
a lawsuit. First day out.

372
00:22:18,237 --> 00:22:21,706
- Patient wakes up on the table.
- You know Lexie slept
with Alex Karev

373
00:22:21,808 --> 00:22:24,458
while I was in LA dealing
with my sick daughter?

374
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,688
According to Meredith, you
were doing more in Los Angeles

375
00:22:26,712 --> 00:22:28,807
- than dealing
with Little Sloan.
- She dumped me.

376
00:22:28,831 --> 00:22:30,709
Which is why you went back
to sleeping with my ex-wife?

377
00:22:30,733 --> 00:22:33,567
- You slept with his ex-wife?
- Wait a second. You're remarried.

378
00:22:33,669 --> 00:22:36,020
- What do you care?
- The Karev thing is forgivable,

379
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:38,405
- considering.
- Not to me.

380
00:22:41,793 --> 00:22:43,376
- What?
- Is that a hickey?

381
00:22:43,478 --> 00:22:46,580
- Uh, it's a... It's a birth mark.
- It is, it's a hickey.

382
00:22:46,682 --> 00:22:50,684
Cristina and I have been...

383
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:53,437
- getting along.
- You two are good together.

384
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:56,690
Not like me and Lexie. Way
better than Yang and Burke.

385
00:22:56,793 --> 00:22:59,727
Yeah, I never understood those
two. They were too monosyllabic.

386
00:22:59,829 --> 00:23:03,080
You know, I made a bet she'd never
make it down that aisle. Won 50 bucks.

387
00:23:03,182 --> 00:23:04,926
- What aisle?
- You haven't heard that story?

388
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:08,902
- That's a good story.
- It's not your story to tell.

389
00:23:15,094 --> 00:23:18,929
Bailey's letting me operate on a
post-op internal bleeding patient.

390
00:23:19,031 --> 00:23:23,500
By myself. Do you
think I can handle it?

391
00:23:26,605 --> 00:23:28,472
I think I can.

392
00:23:31,077 --> 00:23:33,710
Derek tells me you're
thinking about quitting.

393
00:23:39,285 --> 00:23:42,619
I think if my mother
were here to see this,

394
00:23:42,721 --> 00:23:46,089
she would kick your ass
for even considering it.

395
00:23:57,253 --> 00:23:59,786
These loops of
bowel look clean, too.

396
00:23:59,889 --> 00:24:02,022
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

397
00:24:02,124 --> 00:24:05,643
Crap. I bullied them into totally
unnecessary surgery for their kid.

398
00:24:05,745 --> 00:24:08,461
It wasn't unnecessary.
By not finding anything,

399
00:24:08,564 --> 00:24:10,976
we're one step closer to finding
out what isn't wrong with Brad.

400
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,278
Which means we're one step
closer to finding out what is.

401
00:24:13,302 --> 00:24:16,153
At least, that's what you're
gonna tell his angry parents.

402
00:24:16,255 --> 00:24:18,388
- Me?
- You bullied them into surgery.

403
00:24:18,491 --> 00:24:22,309
You take the heat.
More suction, please.

404
00:24:22,411 --> 00:24:24,306
- BP took a dip.
- Damn it. He's getting unstable.

405
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:27,030
Bolus him with a liter
and let's get him closed.

406
00:24:27,133 --> 00:24:30,951
We may not have found the problem,
but there's absolutely something wrong.

407
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:35,989
You know, there isn't anything
that says you can't operate.

408
00:24:36,091 --> 00:24:38,008
Once she's under,
she would never know.

409
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:40,889
I'm not operating on a patient who
doesn't want me to operate on her.

410
00:24:40,913 --> 00:24:43,347
If she wants a resident
doing her surgery,

411
00:24:43,432 --> 00:24:45,952
she gets a resident
doing her surgery.

412
00:24:45,985 --> 00:24:50,521
I wouldn't let you operate unless
I thought you could handle it.

413
00:24:50,623 --> 00:24:53,307
- I could perforate her bowel.
- You won't!

414
00:24:55,877 --> 00:24:57,855
I'll be with you the whole time.

415
00:24:57,879 --> 00:25:02,282
Dr. Webber was mentoring you.
There's no reason why I can't do the same.

416
00:25:02,384 --> 00:25:05,085
The chief wasn't exactly
mentoring me because of my talent.

417
00:25:05,187 --> 00:25:09,122
Richard Webber is not a man
who wastes his time on just anybody.

418
00:25:09,224 --> 00:25:13,427
Last time he mentored a surgeon, it
was me. You think I don't have talent?

419
00:25:13,528 --> 00:25:18,465
Well, hurry up and finish scrubbing
in. You got a patient waiting.

420
00:25:22,872 --> 00:25:24,952
Do you really think
Shepherd's gonna cut all of us?

421
00:25:25,007 --> 00:25:26,417
- What?
- The Mercy Westers.

422
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:28,909
Do you think we're all
gone? Just tell me if you think

423
00:25:29,011 --> 00:25:30,655
I need to start
looking for a job.

424
00:25:30,679 --> 00:25:32,073
Is there a reason
our son is in ICU?

425
00:25:32,097 --> 00:25:33,758
Figure out what's wrong?

426
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:37,518
- Not exactly.
- Why does he have
a tube in his chest?

427
00:25:37,636 --> 00:25:39,948
You said you were
doing abdominal surgery.

428
00:25:39,972 --> 00:25:42,388
Brad became briefly
unstable in surgery.

429
00:25:42,491 --> 00:25:46,159
So we had to put in a central line
which got a little kinked, so his lung...

430
00:25:46,261 --> 00:25:47,772
- Alex!
- Are you saying you cut

431
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:50,275
into our son for nothing
and caused more damage?

432
00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:51,442
- Blood. Blood.
- What?

433
00:25:51,466 --> 00:25:53,711
There is a lot of
blood in the chest tube.

434
00:25:53,735 --> 00:25:55,769
Get a chest tray
and some gloves!

435
00:25:55,871 --> 00:25:57,966
He's already put
out 700cc's of blood!

436
00:25:57,990 --> 00:25:59,751
- What's going on?
- You need to leave right now!

437
00:25:59,775 --> 00:26:02,303
- Like hell we're leaving!
- Somebody tell us
what's going on!

438
00:26:02,327 --> 00:26:04,628
He's crashing! Page
Cardio and Robbins.

439
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:08,232
- We can't wait
for Cardio. Crap!
- What the hell is going on?

440
00:26:08,334 --> 00:26:10,150
I need to open him up. Scalpel!

441
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,670
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

442
00:26:14,957 --> 00:26:17,590
Get away from our son!
Please get away from our son!

443
00:26:17,693 --> 00:26:19,676
He's bradying down!

444
00:26:25,117 --> 00:26:26,750
More suction, please!

445
00:26:31,207 --> 00:26:32,839
There! I think I got it.

446
00:26:32,941 --> 00:26:35,570
- Let me in. What happened?
- He put out
two liters of blood

447
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:38,145
in the last five minutes.
I think I found the source

448
00:26:38,247 --> 00:26:39,841
because the bleeding
started to calm down.

449
00:26:39,865 --> 00:26:42,415
Jump on. We're moving to the OR.

450
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:45,285
- Page Cristina Yang.
- Right away, Doctor.

451
00:26:57,315 --> 00:26:59,783
Wait. Wait, hang on. Hang on!

452
00:27:01,486 --> 00:27:03,887
- It's Teddy. It's Teddy!
- So?

453
00:27:03,989 --> 00:27:06,306
- You're not on her service.
- No, but...

454
00:27:06,408 --> 00:27:09,793
Don't go. She has
another resident today.

455
00:27:09,895 --> 00:27:14,314
Stay here with me.
Stay here with me.

456
00:27:14,416 --> 00:27:15,932
Don't go.

457
00:27:16,034 --> 00:27:17,884
Please.

458
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:35,068
All right.

459
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:37,482
- What's going on? How is he?
- He's critical.

460
00:27:37,506 --> 00:27:40,274
He has a ruptured
aortic arch dissection.

461
00:27:40,376 --> 00:27:43,755
Hardly ever catch them, but Karev
here may have worked a miracle.

462
00:27:43,779 --> 00:27:45,912
Nice work, Karev.

463
00:27:46,032 --> 00:27:47,580
Damn it.

464
00:27:47,682 --> 00:27:49,561
Where is Yang? I need
a second set of hands.

465
00:27:49,585 --> 00:27:51,952
- You want me to scrub in?
- Dr. Altman, I'm available.

466
00:27:54,707 --> 00:27:56,907
- She's waiting for Yang.
- Yeah, I know.

467
00:27:56,959 --> 00:27:59,042
Believe me, I know
I'm not Cristina Yang.

468
00:27:59,144 --> 00:28:01,812
You've made that clear,
but if you give me a chance...

469
00:28:01,914 --> 00:28:03,959
I have very good
hands. I can do this.

470
00:28:03,983 --> 00:28:05,849
I can help.

471
00:28:12,707 --> 00:28:16,543
Cannulate the femoral artery and vein,
then we're gonna cool him down fast.

472
00:28:16,645 --> 00:28:20,530
We have 30 minutes to complete
this repair or this patient is toast.

473
00:28:24,603 --> 00:28:26,203
The bowel looks fine.

474
00:28:26,304 --> 00:28:31,274
Good. Just check the anastomosis
and keep going. Everything still good?

475
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:34,894
BP's stable, BIS level's
45. She's sound asleep.

476
00:28:34,997 --> 00:28:38,332
Just like the last time you
asked. Two minutes ago.

477
00:28:38,434 --> 00:28:40,867
Anastomosis looks
clean. Bowels intact.

478
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:43,287
- Good, get a new mesh.
- And so you know,

479
00:28:43,372 --> 00:28:46,906
I don't read <i>Architectural
Digest</i> in the OR.

480
00:28:47,009 --> 00:28:48,758
That magazine I read earlier?

481
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:51,144
That was the<i> Journal
of Clinical Anesthesia.</i>

482
00:28:51,246 --> 00:28:53,263
- In case you were wondering.
- I wasn't.

483
00:28:53,365 --> 00:28:55,143
Ready for the mesh.
Suture, please?

484
00:28:55,167 --> 00:28:57,984
Get a good bite of fascia.

485
00:28:58,086 --> 00:29:00,436
Actually, I don't like the
sitting down part of my job.

486
00:29:00,538 --> 00:29:02,955
It's not great for the back,
and I like to keep in shape.

487
00:29:03,058 --> 00:29:05,726
So I can lift my big
buckets of money.

488
00:29:08,831 --> 00:29:11,097
I yell when I'm scared.

489
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,118
Some people
whimper or duck, I yell.

490
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:19,222
When she woke up, it was one
of the scariest moments of my life.

491
00:29:19,324 --> 00:29:23,810
So I yelled. And then I yelled
some more. It's what I do.

492
00:29:25,814 --> 00:29:29,632
- Was that an apology?
- Closest thing
you're gonna get.

493
00:29:38,994 --> 00:29:41,661
Hey.

494
00:29:41,764 --> 00:29:44,915
- Ooh! Nice skin graft.
- Thank you.

495
00:29:45,017 --> 00:29:48,018
- So I was talking to Lexie.
- Why?

496
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,587
When? Why are
you talking to her?

497
00:29:50,689 --> 00:29:53,773
- No, she came to me. And actually...
- Don't do this.

498
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:55,553
You're my friend, not
hers. Don't take her side.

499
00:29:55,577 --> 00:29:59,246
I'm not picking sides. I'm just
saying she made some good points.

500
00:29:59,348 --> 00:30:01,114
She dumped me and
jumped into bed with Karev!

501
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:03,116
She doesn't get to
make good points!

502
00:30:03,219 --> 00:30:04,117
Don't you think you're being...?

503
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:05,819
What? Mad? Offended? Disgusted?

504
00:30:05,921 --> 00:30:08,199
Hypocritical? Sexist? Immature?

505
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:12,191
She dumped me! Not
the other way around!

506
00:30:12,294 --> 00:30:17,314
She dumped me for wanting to step up
and be responsible with my own daughter.

507
00:30:17,416 --> 00:30:19,149
You know how big
a step that is for me,

508
00:30:19,251 --> 00:30:22,252
and you know how much I
wanted to take that step with Lexie.

509
00:30:23,188 --> 00:30:25,122
I'm not the one who's immature!

510
00:30:26,608 --> 00:30:29,309
And you made me
wreck my skin graft!

511
00:30:41,606 --> 00:30:43,140
Leslie's out of surgery.

512
00:30:43,242 --> 00:30:46,343
- How'd the repair go?
- Just fine. No complications.

513
00:30:46,445 --> 00:30:49,562
- Meredith did an excellent job.
- Good. That's good.

514
00:30:50,232 --> 00:30:52,165
Good news.

515
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:54,985
- How's the lawyer?
- Lawyer's still here.

516
00:30:55,087 --> 00:30:57,754
- Drooling.
- Damn it.

517
00:31:00,458 --> 00:31:03,793
Tough first day, chief?

518
00:31:03,896 --> 00:31:07,213
- Tough first day.
- You know,
nine times out of ten,

519
00:31:07,316 --> 00:31:11,601
you can make a lawsuit
go away if you apologize.

520
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:17,174
People like to feel heard.
They like to feel respected.

521
00:31:17,276 --> 00:31:21,311
And they like to hear an apology.
That's what Chief Webber would do.

522
00:31:21,413 --> 00:31:24,759
He'd walk right into that woman's
room the minute she got out of recovery

523
00:31:24,783 --> 00:31:27,083
and he'd apologize.

524
00:31:30,839 --> 00:31:32,939
- Dr. Altman.
- When I page you,

525
00:31:33,041 --> 00:31:36,909
- I expect an answer.
- I know. I'm sorry. I was just...

526
00:31:37,012 --> 00:31:39,279
I had a ruptured aortic
arch dissection, and...

527
00:31:39,381 --> 00:31:43,116
- An aortic arch dissection?
- I thought, at the very least,

528
00:31:43,218 --> 00:31:45,563
I could rely on you
to act professionally.

529
00:31:45,587 --> 00:31:48,221
Everything OK?

530
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:50,774
Dr. Altman, I'm
sorry. You're right.

531
00:31:50,876 --> 00:31:53,021
It won't happen again. I
should've responded to your page.

532
00:31:53,045 --> 00:31:56,046
No, wait. I... This
wasn't Cristina's fault.

533
00:31:56,147 --> 00:31:58,093
I detained her
for a trauma thing.

534
00:31:58,117 --> 00:32:01,033
Oh, really? Now you have
something to say to me?

535
00:32:01,135 --> 00:32:02,402
You know what?

536
00:32:03,522 --> 00:32:05,255
Forget it.

537
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:14,447
- What?
- What are you
trying to do to me?

538
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:17,234
I'm... Cristina... I'm...

539
00:32:20,822 --> 00:32:22,505
Come on!

540
00:32:28,046 --> 00:32:30,247
- His heart ruptured?
- This is unbelievable.

541
00:32:30,349 --> 00:32:32,827
- How could you not find this?
- His heart symptoms presented

542
00:32:32,851 --> 00:32:35,096
as abdominal pain, which is
an extremely rare presentation.

543
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,537
It's almost impossible
to diagnose.

544
00:32:37,639 --> 00:32:40,724
But the most important
thing is that Brad is doing fine.

545
00:32:40,826 --> 00:32:42,242
Fine?

546
00:32:42,344 --> 00:32:44,911
You call him being hooked up
to tubes and... You call that fine?

547
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:47,358
Dude, seriously, we're the
only reason your kid's alive.

548
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:49,294
- Karev...
- If you'd had it your way,
you'd have been home

549
00:32:49,318 --> 00:32:51,695
when Brad's aorta ruptured
and he'd be dead right now.

550
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:54,999
- Think about how much school
he'd be missing then, huh?
- Karev! We're done.

551
00:32:55,023 --> 00:32:57,708
Excuse me. Follow me right now.

552
00:33:10,422 --> 00:33:12,622
Go away, please, Bailey.

553
00:33:12,724 --> 00:33:14,969
I don't want you
to see me like this.

554
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:19,362
Uh, all due respect, chief, everybody's
been seeing you like this all day.

555
00:33:19,464 --> 00:33:22,799
And I don't know details. I don't
know what's going on with you.

556
00:33:22,901 --> 00:33:26,503
But you can't sit here
anymore. Not like this.

557
00:33:26,605 --> 00:33:28,238
I can't give them this.

558
00:33:28,841 --> 00:33:31,107
Shepherd. Jennings.

559
00:33:31,209 --> 00:33:36,246
If I do what they want me to do,
it's like saying that they were right.

560
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:38,581
Right about doing this.

561
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:42,118
- Right about me.
- Saying they're
right about what?

562
00:33:44,389 --> 00:33:47,024
They want me to
say I'm an alcoholic.

563
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:53,829
Well, are you an alcoholic?

564
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:56,482
Yes.

565
00:33:58,003 --> 00:34:02,705
But if I sign these papers,
I have to stop drinking.

566
00:34:02,807 --> 00:34:05,341
And go to rehab.

567
00:34:05,444 --> 00:34:08,177
And I don't think
I'm ready to do that.

568
00:34:10,365 --> 00:34:16,036
Drinking, it feels a little
bit like all I have left.

569
00:34:16,138 --> 00:34:20,123
You are better than this.
I've seen you be better.

570
00:34:20,225 --> 00:34:23,159
Look, the way to win,
the way to beat them,

571
00:34:23,244 --> 00:34:27,997
is to stop fighting
them. You go get better.

572
00:34:28,099 --> 00:34:31,034
You be the man that I've
always known you to be.

573
00:34:31,136 --> 00:34:33,603
You be the chief.

574
00:34:37,542 --> 00:34:39,276
Be the chief.

575
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,933
If you want to work in Peds,
you can't get emotional.

576
00:34:47,035 --> 00:34:49,547
- You said it was
part of the job.
- There is a difference

577
00:34:49,571 --> 00:34:52,956
between advocating for tiny
humans and berating terrified parents!

578
00:34:53,058 --> 00:34:57,060
You're good with kids, I can see that.
You've got great hands, great instincts.

579
00:34:57,162 --> 00:34:59,362
We already knew that. You're
as good as anyone I've seen

580
00:34:59,397 --> 00:35:02,398
when it comes to advocating for
patients. But until you've been a parent,

581
00:35:02,501 --> 00:35:05,101
until you've stayed up
nights with a screaming infant

582
00:35:05,203 --> 00:35:07,637
or dealt day in and day
out with a terrorist toddler

583
00:35:07,739 --> 00:35:11,090
or raised a lying teenager,
you don't get to judge parents.

584
00:35:11,193 --> 00:35:13,493
You have to
advocate for the kids.

585
00:35:13,595 --> 00:35:15,961
You don't get to
berate terrified parents.

586
00:35:16,064 --> 00:35:18,130
- You clear on that?
- Yes.

587
00:35:19,451 --> 00:35:22,986
Good. Then you go
apologize to that family.

588
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:27,224
Karev?

589
00:35:28,877 --> 00:35:31,044
You saved that kid's life today.

590
00:35:32,147 --> 00:35:33,512
How'd it feel?

591
00:35:36,935 --> 00:35:38,301
Feels great.

592
00:35:40,472 --> 00:35:43,973
- Hardcore, right?
- Yeah.

593
00:35:44,059 --> 00:35:45,258
Welcome to Peds.

594
00:36:01,226 --> 00:36:04,677
I know it's been a long day and
you're all anxious to get home,

595
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:08,198
but I feel like we got off on
the wrong foot this morning.

596
00:36:09,651 --> 00:36:12,785
I don't expect to win
your trust overnight.

597
00:36:12,887 --> 00:36:17,340
But I want each of you
to know you have mine.

598
00:36:19,711 --> 00:36:23,813
Which is why I felt it was important
to personally come in here and...

599
00:36:23,915 --> 00:36:27,083
apologize.

600
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:31,087
Mrs. Wilson, do
you have a moment?

601
00:36:33,124 --> 00:36:35,044
I want to clear some things up.

602
00:36:36,294 --> 00:36:38,961
I'd like to offer each
of you your jobs back.

603
00:36:39,063 --> 00:36:40,930
There are gonna be
cuts down the line.

604
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,748
But you both deserve
a fighting chance.

605
00:36:42,851 --> 00:36:45,584
- Oh, my God.
- Thank you, Dr. Shepherd.

606
00:36:45,687 --> 00:36:48,954
Thank you. Thank you.

607
00:36:49,074 --> 00:36:51,440
<i>I am neither pro
nor anti-merger.</i>

608
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:54,393
<i>From this point on,
everyone has a clean slate.</i>

609
00:37:18,987 --> 00:37:21,287
<i>I'm not focused on the past.</i>

610
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:49,615
I'm trying to understand you.

611
00:37:51,336 --> 00:37:53,886
You've been trying to
screw me into submission.

612
00:37:53,988 --> 00:37:55,748
- I was not.
- You've been trying to screw me

613
00:37:55,774 --> 00:37:58,908
into submission. And I let you
because the sex was so good,

614
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:01,110
- and your ego was hurt.
- I'm trying.

615
00:38:01,212 --> 00:38:05,348
I am trying to understand
you. I am trying to know you.

616
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:07,600
I am trying to... love you.

617
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:11,771
And I don't know how. I don't know
how, 'cause you don't give me anything.

618
00:38:11,873 --> 00:38:14,724
The vent burn was you
branding me? Like I'm chattel?

619
00:38:14,826 --> 00:38:16,459
I'm trying!

620
00:38:19,898 --> 00:38:23,750
I don't know you. I don't know you
'cause you don't give me anything.

621
00:38:23,852 --> 00:38:26,402
- I give you everything.
- Burke.

622
00:38:26,505 --> 00:38:28,025
- What?
- Burke. Preston Burke.

623
00:38:28,106 --> 00:38:31,407
You were engaged. There was almost
a wedding. Why didn't that happen?

624
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:33,754
No. No, I'm not...
We're not doing this.

625
00:38:33,778 --> 00:38:35,527
See? You give me nothing!

626
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:39,215
Maybe... Maybe I was trying
to screw you into submission.

627
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:43,335
Maybe I was
trying to... connect.

628
00:38:43,438 --> 00:38:47,874
I'll try anything, I'll try anything, but
you have to give me something back.

629
00:38:47,976 --> 00:38:52,278
- Well, Burke is irrelevant.
- Like I'll be
in three years time?

630
00:38:53,514 --> 00:38:55,948
- That's not fair.
- I'm trying to love you.

631
00:38:56,050 --> 00:38:58,551
Why won't you let me?

632
00:39:01,506 --> 00:39:03,406
Burke...

633
00:39:07,812 --> 00:39:10,480
Burke was, uh...

634
00:39:15,337 --> 00:39:17,536
He took something from me.

635
00:39:19,524 --> 00:39:22,191
He took little pieces of me.

636
00:39:22,293 --> 00:39:25,661
Little pieces, over time.
So small I didn't notice.

637
00:39:25,763 --> 00:39:29,632
He wanted me to be
something I wasn't.

638
00:39:29,734 --> 00:39:33,436
And I made myself
into what he wanted.

639
00:39:33,538 --> 00:39:36,139
One day I was me, Cristina
Yang, and then, suddenly,

640
00:39:36,241 --> 00:39:39,975
I was lying for him and
jeopardizing my career

641
00:39:40,078 --> 00:39:45,548
and agreeing to be married and
wearing a ring and being a bride.

642
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:50,436
Until I was standing there in a
wedding dress with no eyebrows,

643
00:39:50,538 --> 00:39:53,806
and I wasn't Cristina
Yang anymore.

644
00:39:53,908 --> 00:39:57,977
And even then I would've
married him. I would have.

645
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:03,649
I lost myself for a long time.

646
00:40:03,751 --> 00:40:05,651
And now...

647
00:40:09,056 --> 00:40:11,337
that I am finally me again...

648
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,627
I can't...

649
00:40:16,798 --> 00:40:19,210
I love you. I love you
more than I loved Burke.

650
00:40:19,234 --> 00:40:23,669
I love you. And that
scares the crap out of me.

651
00:40:23,771 --> 00:40:25,538
Because...

652
00:40:27,041 --> 00:40:31,611
when you asked me
to ignore Teddy's page,

653
00:40:31,713 --> 00:40:34,547
you took a piece of me.

654
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:38,951
And I let you.

655
00:40:42,089 --> 00:40:43,823
And...

656
00:40:46,794 --> 00:40:49,495
that will never...

657
00:40:49,597 --> 00:40:52,565
happen again.

658
00:41:01,009 --> 00:41:03,509
<i>I'm looking to the future.</i>

659
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:09,148
- You feel better?
- A little.

660
00:41:12,954 --> 00:41:16,588
This really isn't
gonna work for me.

661
00:41:16,690 --> 00:41:20,210
<i>To all the promise this
hospital has to offer.</i>

662
00:41:40,465 --> 00:41:43,783
<i>I plan to honor Richard
Webber and his legacy.</i>

663
00:41:44,386 --> 00:41:45,851
<i>Not undo it.</i>

664
00:41:48,807 --> 00:41:50,439
Thank you, Richard.

665
00:41:54,812 --> 00:41:56,345
I'm sorry.

666
00:42:05,072 --> 00:42:08,508
<i>Which is why I'm both
humbled and honored</i>

667
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:11,093
<i>to be your new chief of surgery.</i>
