1
00:00:09,894 --> 00:00:11,609
<i>It's impossible to describe</i>

2
00:00:11,712 --> 00:00:13,056
<i>the panic that comes over you</i>

3
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,240
<i>when you're a surgeon
and your pager goes off</i>

4
00:00:15,316 --> 00:00:16,726
<i>in the middle of the night.</i>

5
00:00:26,159 --> 00:00:27,987
<i>Your heart starts to race.</i>

6
00:00:28,011 --> 00:00:29,561
Please don't be mine.

7
00:00:29,663 --> 00:00:31,763
<i>Your mind freezes.</i>

8
00:00:31,866 --> 00:00:35,050
<i>- Your fingers go numb.</i>
<i>- </i> Not mine.

9
00:00:35,152 --> 00:00:37,452
Wake up!

10
00:00:37,554 --> 00:00:39,788
- I'm up.
- They're paging you.

11
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:41,256
<i>You're invested.</i>

12
00:00:42,526 --> 00:00:44,442
I'm sleeping!

13
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:48,446
<i>They're someone's mom,
someone's dad, someone's kid.</i>

14
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:49,982
<i>And now it's on you.</i>

15
00:00:50,084 --> 00:00:53,218
<i>Because that someone's
life is now in your hands.</i>

16
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,288
Robbins, Karev's with your
patient. Torres, come with me.

17
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:59,892
We have a 15-year-old female,
she fell off the roof of her house.

18
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:03,028
- Now, I think that...
- She's gonna be OK, right?

19
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:05,141
I just need to know,
is she gonna be OK?

20
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:08,901
And this is her mother. Mrs. Boyd, I
need to bring Dr. Torres up to speed.

21
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:10,480
She's never been in
any accident before,

22
00:01:10,504 --> 00:01:12,871
she's never even
broken any bones.

23
00:01:12,973 --> 00:01:15,841
Oh. You paged me here at 4:00am
for a couple of broken bones?

24
00:01:15,943 --> 00:01:17,876
More like 50.

25
00:01:19,547 --> 00:01:22,313
<i>As surgeons,</i>

26
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:24,950
<i>we're always invested
in our patients.</i>

27
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:30,388
Laura Young, 30 weeks pregnant. Car
accident, head CT showed a subdural.

28
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:33,091
Shepherd's coming in. Baby's
in distress, OB on its way.

29
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:35,272
- It really hurts!
- Hold on. Move the wand up.

30
00:01:35,296 --> 00:01:38,330
- What?
- OK, baby's brain
is hemorrhaging.

31
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:40,610
She needs a crash-c while
Shepherd handles the bleed.

32
00:01:40,634 --> 00:01:42,178
Grab the wheel
and start running.

33
00:01:42,202 --> 00:01:43,897
<i>But when your
patient's a child...</i>

34
00:01:43,921 --> 00:01:45,865
Get another unit of packed
cells, meet me in the OR.

35
00:01:45,889 --> 00:01:48,234
<i>- You're not just invested...
- -</i> We need the OR!

36
00:01:48,258 --> 00:01:50,103
<i>- You're responsible.</i>
- We're already on our way.

37
00:01:50,127 --> 00:01:51,871
There's only one OR
prepped this time of night.

38
00:01:51,895 --> 00:01:54,629
- Which is why we need it.
- Mine's got a subdural.

39
00:01:54,731 --> 00:01:57,866
- Fifty broken bones!
- Stroke in the womb!

40
00:01:57,968 --> 00:01:59,262
- Oh!
- Whoa!

41
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:01,069
All right. Get another
OR ready now!

42
00:02:01,171 --> 00:02:04,555
<i>Responsible for whether
or not that child survives,</i>

43
00:02:04,658 --> 00:02:05,924
<i>has a future.</i>

44
00:02:08,896 --> 00:02:11,130
<i>And that's enough
to terrify anyone.</i>

45
00:02:15,402 --> 00:02:18,102
- What's her status?
- Mom's heart rate and BP

46
00:02:18,205 --> 00:02:20,472
has been fluctuating,
but she's ready for you.

47
00:02:20,574 --> 00:02:21,835
Let's prep her for a craniotomy.

48
00:02:21,859 --> 00:02:24,409
Apgar's only four.
Get to NICU now.

49
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:29,464
- Drain's in a good position.
- She's breathing over the vent.

50
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:32,700
- Maybe we should extubate her.
- But watch for apnoeic episodes

51
00:02:32,803 --> 00:02:34,083
and keep an eye out for her CBC.

52
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,221
Too much blood
draining from her head.

53
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:38,757
- What time is it, Karev?
- Uh, half past eight.

54
00:02:38,859 --> 00:02:41,293
Half past eight. I've
been awake for five hours

55
00:02:41,395 --> 00:02:44,112
and my day hasn't started.
Rough way to start your morning.

56
00:02:44,214 --> 00:02:47,849
A stroke before you're even
born. Rough way to start a life.

57
00:02:49,686 --> 00:02:51,787
Yeah.

58
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,290
Hey. I brought you some coffee.

59
00:02:55,392 --> 00:02:59,161
- Oh. You already have one.
- I want your coffee,
need your coffee.

60
00:02:59,263 --> 00:03:01,729
When we see Cristina, she's
gonna be mad. Mad at me

61
00:03:01,832 --> 00:03:04,099
for not paging her here.
Possibly mad at you

62
00:03:04,201 --> 00:03:06,434
for not waking her up
either. I'm handling this.

63
00:03:06,536 --> 00:03:08,804
Do not engage her,
do not provoke her.

64
00:03:08,906 --> 00:03:10,105
Simply ignore. All right?

65
00:03:10,207 --> 00:03:12,841
That's your plan? Ignore
the scalpel-hungry animal?

66
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:15,210
Yep, until I come up
with something better.

67
00:03:21,635 --> 00:03:25,820
OK. I know this is the first time on a
Peds rotation with me for some of you.

68
00:03:25,922 --> 00:03:27,322
Not for others.

69
00:03:27,441 --> 00:03:30,074
But I wanted you to understand
that I run my Peds unit

70
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,627
differently than you're used to.

71
00:03:31,729 --> 00:03:34,095
This is not general
surgery in miniature.

72
00:03:34,197 --> 00:03:36,614
These are the tiny humans.

73
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:38,065
These are children.

74
00:03:38,168 --> 00:03:41,035
They believe in magic.
They play pretend.

75
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:43,449
There is fairy dust
in their IV bags.

76
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:46,607
They hope and they cross their
fingers and they make wishes.

77
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:49,944
And that makes them
more resilient than adults.

78
00:03:50,047 --> 00:03:51,924
They recover
faster, survive worse.

79
00:03:51,948 --> 00:03:53,142
They believe.

80
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:57,653
In Peds, we have...
miracles and magic.

81
00:03:57,755 --> 00:04:00,588
In Peds, anything is possible.

82
00:04:10,366 --> 00:04:12,629
- Morning, Dr. Robbins.
- Morning,
Dr. Wallace.

83
00:04:12,653 --> 00:04:15,269
You've introduced yourself
to Mr. and Mrs. Boyd?

84
00:04:15,371 --> 00:04:17,438
Yes. Reminds me
of Hillary at that age.

85
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:19,524
Such an overachiever.

86
00:04:19,626 --> 00:04:22,060
Dr. Yang, why don't you present?

87
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:24,112
Yeah.

88
00:04:27,484 --> 00:04:29,484
Excuse me, little...

89
00:04:29,586 --> 00:04:31,118
doctor boy.

90
00:04:31,221 --> 00:04:34,306
Uh, Hillary Boyd, 15 years
old. Fell off the roof of her house.

91
00:04:34,408 --> 00:04:36,353
Fifty-two acute
fractures were diagnosed

92
00:04:36,377 --> 00:04:38,676
when she was
admitted last night.

93
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:41,930
An intricate and extremely
challenging ORIF surgery

94
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:46,134
was performed by Dr. Torres
and Dr. Hunt this morning.

95
00:04:46,236 --> 00:04:49,287
- Before rounds.
- Thank you, Dr. Yang.

96
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:51,689
If she fares well enough
today, I'd like to go in tomorrow

97
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,908
to repair her
subtrochanteric fracture.

98
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:57,979
Can anyone tell me the proper dosage
of ceftriaxone for a pediatric patient?

99
00:04:58,082 --> 00:05:00,610
- Fifty milligrams per kilogram per day.
- - Mm-hmm.

100
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:03,602
Dr. Wallace, can you tell me
the proper dose for this patient

101
00:05:03,703 --> 00:05:05,153
if she were 42 kilograms?

102
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:12,310
Two point one grams per
day, if you carry the decimal.

103
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:19,685
- OK, who's presenting?
- I am, Dr. Robbins.

104
00:05:19,787 --> 00:05:22,170
- Proceed.
- Wallace Anderson.

105
00:05:22,272 --> 00:05:24,439
Ten years old, almost 11.

106
00:05:24,558 --> 00:05:27,542
Been here for seven months, in
and out over the past two years.

107
00:05:27,644 --> 00:05:31,562
Suffers from short gut syndrome,
which means he can't absorb nutrition.

108
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:34,098
Exactly. Dr. Percy?

109
00:05:34,201 --> 00:05:37,936
Fifteen intestinal surgeries to date
plus a bowel lengthening procedure

110
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:39,371
which helped for a while,

111
00:05:39,473 --> 00:05:41,633
but recently had to go back
to being fed through TPN.

112
00:05:41,691 --> 00:05:44,776
- Yum.
- How'd he do this morning?

113
00:05:44,878 --> 00:05:47,378
We covered some advanced
algebraic conversions.

114
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,748
Dr. Robbins helps me with
math and science homework

115
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,899
- by letting me go on rounds.
- Fascinating.

116
00:05:52,002 --> 00:05:53,962
We try to keep his life
as normal as we can,

117
00:05:54,037 --> 00:05:55,236
even living in a hospital.

118
00:05:55,338 --> 00:05:57,939
But I can skip my
homework on Friday, right?

119
00:05:58,041 --> 00:06:00,859
- Since it's my birthday?
- Since it's your birthday.

120
00:06:00,961 --> 00:06:03,512
What about Dr. Robbins?
It is her birthday, too.

121
00:06:03,614 --> 00:06:05,864
I'm afraid I can't skip
my homework, Wallace,

122
00:06:05,965 --> 00:06:08,200
but I can come celebrate
with you like I promised.

123
00:06:10,353 --> 00:06:12,270
Dr. Robbins.

124
00:06:12,373 --> 00:06:14,706
We've requested a
meeting with Chief Webber

125
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:18,359
and a representative
from the hospital board.

126
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:20,462
And we'd like you there, too.

127
00:06:20,564 --> 00:06:22,563
OK.

128
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:27,935
They didn't give you any indication
as to what this meeting was about?

129
00:06:28,038 --> 00:06:30,472
You know as much as I do.

130
00:06:30,573 --> 00:06:32,457
You treated their son, right?

131
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:34,892
You better pray you didn't
do something to piss them off.

132
00:06:34,994 --> 00:06:39,063
God knows this hospital can't
afford another misstep right now.

133
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:40,765
It's a pleasure to
see you again, Paul.

134
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:42,734
Bethany, you look lovely.

135
00:06:48,859 --> 00:06:52,093
We didn't think Wallace
would see his ninth birthday,

136
00:06:52,195 --> 00:06:53,695
let alone his tenth.

137
00:06:53,797 --> 00:06:55,931
And now this week, his eleventh.

138
00:06:56,033 --> 00:07:00,168
Which is why we'd like to offer Seattle
Grace Mercy West's Peds Program

139
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:03,471
a gift... of 25 million dollars.

140
00:07:06,794 --> 00:07:09,094
Twenty-five... million?

141
00:07:09,196 --> 00:07:13,180
Half to research, to continue searching
for a cure for Wallace's condition,

142
00:07:13,282 --> 00:07:14,966
and half to the hospital itself.

143
00:07:15,068 --> 00:07:18,719
Uh... I... I'm...

144
00:07:18,821 --> 00:07:21,539
I mean...

145
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:25,677
- Twenty-five million dollars?
- Happy birthday, Arizona.

146
00:07:30,684 --> 00:07:34,853
I knew Wallace's parents were wealthy,
but not 25 million dollars wealthy.

147
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:36,904
That's
libraries-named-after-you money.

148
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:41,476
Save-babies-in-Africa and
has-dinner-at-the-White-House type money.

149
00:07:41,578 --> 00:07:43,339
People don't give
me that kind of money.

150
00:07:43,363 --> 00:07:45,575
You have an unfair advantage,
you work with children.

151
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,467
Oatmeal, side of fruit,
wheat toast, hold the butter.

152
00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:51,069
- Thank you.
- That money is gonna make

153
00:07:51,171 --> 00:07:53,971
such a difference for so many
patients. It's really amazing.

154
00:07:54,073 --> 00:07:56,708
Maybe I should start
doing more cleft palate kids.

155
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,370
Everyone's a sucker for those.

156
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:00,657
Cheese omelet, extra butter,
cinnamon toast, crispy bacon.

157
00:08:00,681 --> 00:08:04,483
- Mine!
- Twenty-five million
is cool, right?

158
00:08:04,585 --> 00:08:07,736
- Best birthday gift ever.
- Birthday gift?

159
00:08:07,838 --> 00:08:09,704
Yeah, because
the money's a gift.

160
00:08:09,806 --> 00:08:11,940
It's for the hospital,
not Arizona,

161
00:08:12,042 --> 00:08:13,708
but since your
birthday's on Friday...

162
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:17,579
Um... How does Little Grey know
about your birthday and I don't?

163
00:08:17,681 --> 00:08:19,792
Birthdays are just
days like any other days.

164
00:08:19,816 --> 00:08:21,711
I don't like them, don't
celebrate, no big deal.

165
00:08:21,735 --> 00:08:23,234
Twenty-five million?

166
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:26,320
That's a big deal.
Crap, I'm gonna be late.

167
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:28,306
I will see you there.

168
00:08:28,408 --> 00:08:30,458
Mm-hmm. Hmm.

169
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:34,195
She's downplaying it, right?

170
00:08:34,297 --> 00:08:36,442
I'm her girlfriend. I have to
do something for her birthday.

171
00:08:36,466 --> 00:08:37,643
- Yes.
- No.

172
00:08:37,667 --> 00:08:40,351
Of course you do.
Oh, a surprise party!

173
00:08:40,453 --> 00:08:42,933
Whoa, whoa. Bad idea.

174
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:45,706
Surprise parties are
hostile. They're dark.

175
00:08:45,808 --> 00:08:49,193
People jump out
and scream at you.

176
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:51,462
They never come to any good.

177
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:57,719
Karev.

178
00:08:58,355 --> 00:09:00,087
Morning, chief.

179
00:09:01,224 --> 00:09:04,826
When you're free, come find me.

180
00:09:04,928 --> 00:09:05,938
What's that all about?

181
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,829
He fired me. I
refused to be fired.

182
00:09:07,931 --> 00:09:10,251
So I say hello to him every
morning and he says not a word.

183
00:09:10,334 --> 00:09:11,911
- Sounds familiar.
- Haven't heard from Stevens?

184
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:13,234
Not a word.

185
00:09:14,371 --> 00:09:16,731
They'll come around
when they come around.

186
00:09:21,094 --> 00:09:22,374
Chief, you need me?

187
00:09:22,462 --> 00:09:24,095
Uh... I wish I didn't have to

188
00:09:24,197 --> 00:09:26,481
saddle you with
this, Karev, but...

189
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:29,801
- What is all this?
- As Stevens left
no forwarding address

190
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:32,470
and as you are
officially her next of kin,

191
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:36,408
this is her unpaid balance
of her medical bills.

192
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:39,144
Unpaid balance? I don't get
it. We work at the hospital.

193
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:41,746
And insurance doesn't
take care of everything.

194
00:09:41,848 --> 00:09:44,665
I'm sorry. Accounting's been
pressuring me since the merger

195
00:09:44,767 --> 00:09:46,667
and I can't ignore
it any longer.

196
00:09:57,714 --> 00:10:00,048
What's yours in for?

197
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:01,416
Delivered her yesterday,

198
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:03,418
stroked out at ten
weeks premature.

199
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,621
- Yours?
- Born with its insides
on the outside.

200
00:10:06,723 --> 00:10:11,126
Two days post-op.
Resilient little guy.

201
00:10:11,228 --> 00:10:13,428
More bleeding overnight.

202
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:16,359
- Should we try FFP?
- At this point,
we should try anything.

203
00:10:16,383 --> 00:10:20,217
Get me a repeat MRI and page
me if she becomes bradycardic

204
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:23,604
or starts having apnoea
spells. I'll be on rounds.

205
00:10:26,976 --> 00:10:28,237
- Hey.
- Hey.

206
00:10:28,261 --> 00:10:31,512
I was picking up some
labs from Dr. Bailey

207
00:10:31,614 --> 00:10:33,230
and I saw you had these waiting.

208
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:35,667
Thought I'd bring them
by, save you the trip.

209
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:37,935
Thanks.

210
00:10:39,873 --> 00:10:41,606
Are you OK?

211
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:44,809
I overheard a little bit of your
conversation with the chief...

212
00:10:44,911 --> 00:10:47,712
I'm trying to save a baby
here. Get out of my face.

213
00:10:48,465 --> 00:10:49,664
Oh.

214
00:10:51,034 --> 00:10:52,817
Got it.

215
00:10:59,342 --> 00:11:02,043
- He's still sleeping?
- No.

216
00:11:02,145 --> 00:11:05,379
- He had a bad night.
- I can still go on rounds.

217
00:11:05,481 --> 00:11:08,349
- I feel better. Just give me a second.
- You know what?

218
00:11:08,451 --> 00:11:10,568
How about if you
take a rest for now,

219
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,920
and you can join me for
evening rounds instead?

220
00:11:13,022 --> 00:11:15,022
OK.

221
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:17,625
He listens to you more
than he does to me.

222
00:11:17,727 --> 00:11:20,478
Well, yeah. She's a doctor, Mom.

223
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:24,065
And you're just... a mom.

224
00:11:24,167 --> 00:11:28,152
Oh. OK. How about
you close your eyes

225
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:31,155
and you let me do
what moms do, OK?

226
00:11:35,211 --> 00:11:37,545
Bad dreams, bad dreams, go away.

227
00:11:37,647 --> 00:11:40,014
Good dreams, good
dreams, here to stay.

228
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:42,233
Bad dreams, bad dreams, go away.

229
00:11:42,318 --> 00:11:45,820
Good dreams, good
dreams, here to stay.

230
00:11:45,922 --> 00:11:49,390
You have to do it
three times for it to work.

231
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,659
One more.

232
00:11:51,761 --> 00:11:54,373
I want you to repeat his chemistries
and get an abdominal series.

233
00:11:54,397 --> 00:11:58,867
He's had bad nights before, but I want
to make sure we're not missing anything.

234
00:12:09,696 --> 00:12:12,030
- How's she doing?
- Touch and go. How's the baby?

235
00:12:12,132 --> 00:12:13,932
- Same.
- Any news from the family?

236
00:12:14,034 --> 00:12:16,367
I left a message.
Haven't heard back yet.

237
00:12:16,469 --> 00:12:19,120
ICP is elevated,
BP won't stabilize.

238
00:12:19,222 --> 00:12:22,223
A hundred mikes of
fentanyl, please. Laura?

239
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:23,405
Laura, can you hear me?

240
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:25,793
My baby... Where's my baby?

241
00:12:25,895 --> 00:12:28,846
- She's struggling,
but hanging on.
- Can I see her?

242
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:30,793
Sorry, no. You're
too unstable to move.

243
00:12:30,817 --> 00:12:34,101
- And so is the baby.
- I just want to hold her.

244
00:12:34,203 --> 00:12:36,704
Please, I want to hold my baby.

245
00:12:36,806 --> 00:12:38,906
- I need you to stay calm, OK?
- What if she dies,

246
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:42,109
before I get to
hold her? She can't.

247
00:12:42,212 --> 00:12:44,812
She can't go before
she's ever even been held.

248
00:12:44,914 --> 00:12:46,698
It's OK, it's OK...

249
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,117
Push ten of diazepam and
get me some supplemental O2.

250
00:12:50,219 --> 00:12:52,753
Crap. 911. It's her baby!

251
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,575
She's bradying down
and she lost access.

252
00:12:57,677 --> 00:12:59,305
- I'll start a CPAP.
- Dr. Robbins?

253
00:12:59,329 --> 00:13:01,162
- Not now.
- You'll want to see this.

254
00:13:01,264 --> 00:13:05,333
- It's the X-rays
on Wallace Anderson.
- Show me.

255
00:13:05,435 --> 00:13:08,903
- See? He has dilated
loops of bowel.
- Flip.

256
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:12,173
Flip.

257
00:13:12,275 --> 00:13:14,642
Damn it. Damn it. He has
another bowel obstruction

258
00:13:14,744 --> 00:13:17,878
- and he's not compensating.
- I got this, go.

259
00:13:21,101 --> 00:13:23,550
- A nurse just checked that.
- A nurse checked it.

260
00:13:23,652 --> 00:13:27,221
I'm gonna check it. Three other people
in the OR will check it. We're thorough.

261
00:13:27,323 --> 00:13:29,624
Honey, please let
them do their jobs.

262
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:32,393
Mr. and Mrs. Boyd?

263
00:13:32,495 --> 00:13:33,728
We thought you should know

264
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:35,550
that Hillary's tox
screen from yesterday

265
00:13:35,598 --> 00:13:37,982
showed signs of psilocybin
in her bloodstream.

266
00:13:38,084 --> 00:13:41,418
- What does that mean?
- Well,

267
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:44,222
it means that when
she fell from the roof,

268
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:46,257
- she was...
- Shrooming.

269
00:13:46,342 --> 00:13:47,822
- Yeah.
- Magic mushrooms.

270
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,777
- What?
- Hillary!

271
00:13:49,879 --> 00:13:52,730
- Mushrooms?
- Can everybody
please chill out?

272
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:56,367
- What in God's name
were you thinking?
- I can't believe...

273
00:13:56,469 --> 00:14:00,204
You're a disappointment, young
lady. A big, big disappointment.

274
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:03,190
Dad, please, OK? The last
thing I am is a disappointment.

275
00:14:03,293 --> 00:14:05,510
I get straight A's.
I'm on honor roll.

276
00:14:05,612 --> 00:14:07,807
I run the student council. I
basically am the school paper.

277
00:14:07,831 --> 00:14:09,613
I tutor kids with
reading problems.

278
00:14:09,715 --> 00:14:12,683
OK? I'm every parent's dream
come true, including yours.

279
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:15,303
I was exploring the
bounds of my consciousness

280
00:14:15,405 --> 00:14:18,789
with the help of a mushroom. I made
a calculated risk going on the roof.

281
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:22,744
Falling off, well, that was
a low-probability event.

282
00:14:22,846 --> 00:14:25,396
Even low-probability
events occasionally occur,

283
00:14:25,498 --> 00:14:26,797
and this one did.

284
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:29,267
So, yeah, you're
bummed I miscalculated

285
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:32,470
'cause it reminds you
of your own fallibility.

286
00:14:32,572 --> 00:14:36,074
I'm bummed, too.
Let's just leave it at that.

287
00:14:42,398 --> 00:14:44,982
Cap refill's five
seconds. Push one of epi.

288
00:14:48,338 --> 00:14:51,422
It's not working. Heart
rate's down to the 60s.

289
00:14:51,524 --> 00:14:53,624
- Starting compressions.
- Can I help?

290
00:14:53,727 --> 00:14:57,022
Doubt it. At this rate, this kid's
not gonna last more than an hour.

291
00:14:57,046 --> 00:15:00,381
She's only 30 weeks.
Pretty young to survive.

292
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:03,317
So, what? You're just gonna
stand there and watch her die?

293
00:15:03,419 --> 00:15:05,753
- Pretty much.
- That sucks!

294
00:15:05,855 --> 00:15:09,006
It is what it is. It's protocol.

295
00:15:13,363 --> 00:15:14,643
Beeping drives me nuts.

296
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,050
- That...
- Kid's gonna die.

297
00:15:19,152 --> 00:15:20,701
Deal with it or get out.

298
00:15:35,618 --> 00:15:38,136
Hey there, girl.

299
00:15:38,238 --> 00:15:41,072
I got you. Yeah.

300
00:15:41,174 --> 00:15:43,941
It's OK. You're not alone.

301
00:15:44,043 --> 00:15:47,077
No, you're not.
You're not alone.

302
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:49,147
Wait. Hold on.

303
00:15:49,249 --> 00:15:51,649
Are you saying you can't do
more surgery on him or you won't?

304
00:15:51,684 --> 00:15:55,186
It's not a question of if I can.
It's whether or not I should.

305
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:57,354
In my opinion,

306
00:15:57,456 --> 00:16:00,758
Wallace isn't strong enough
to handle another operation.

307
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:03,594
But with surgery, how
long would he have then?

308
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:06,864
I'm not confident that he'll
even make it off the table.

309
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,366
But if he did, how long?

310
00:16:12,855 --> 00:16:16,624
- I strongly advise against...
- How long?

311
00:16:22,265 --> 00:16:24,265
Maybe two months.

312
00:16:25,751 --> 00:16:27,418
I'm... sorry,

313
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:31,622
but the moment that we've
been fighting for two years...

314
00:16:33,126 --> 00:16:34,992
it's here.

315
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:42,533
So you need to
prepare yourselves,

316
00:16:42,635 --> 00:16:44,630
and you need to prepare Wallace.

317
00:16:44,654 --> 00:16:46,987
You think I've been pouring
all this money into research

318
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:49,690
so you can find a cure
for some other kid? No!

319
00:16:49,792 --> 00:16:52,443
- You have to do this surgery.
- Mr. Anderson...

320
00:16:52,545 --> 00:16:55,162
You buy our son two more months!

321
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:58,499
You buy him more time so
that we can buy him a cure!

322
00:17:03,639 --> 00:17:05,005
I'm sorry.

323
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:13,698
What are we gonna do?

324
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:17,217
Robbins.

325
00:17:20,273 --> 00:17:23,524
These aren't people
who hear the word "no."

326
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:26,466
If they want surgery for their
son, they'll get surgery for their son,

327
00:17:26,495 --> 00:17:29,329
whether or not
you're the one to do it.

328
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:32,933
You've been with
this boy since day one.

329
00:17:33,035 --> 00:17:37,071
I believe you can
do this successfully.

330
00:17:37,707 --> 00:17:39,140
Don't walk away now

331
00:17:39,242 --> 00:17:42,477
unless you know beyond a
shadow of a doubt that you can't.

332
00:17:45,114 --> 00:17:48,366
- The surgery's
a bad idea, chief.
- But is it impossible?

333
00:17:48,468 --> 00:17:51,001
In your hands,

334
00:17:51,104 --> 00:17:53,404
is it impossible?

335
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:59,143
- OK.
- OK?

336
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:01,045
OK. I'll do it.

337
00:18:01,147 --> 00:18:02,980
I'll try.

338
00:18:18,565 --> 00:18:22,116
- Oh, is that the preemie?
- Yeah. I was just...

339
00:18:22,218 --> 00:18:23,718
I tried everything.

340
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:28,272
I just thought maybe somebody
should hold her before she...

341
00:18:29,242 --> 00:18:31,542
- Kangaroo.
- What?

342
00:18:31,644 --> 00:18:34,645
The way you're holding the
baby, it's called a Kangaroo hold.

343
00:18:34,747 --> 00:18:38,816
There's been cases where the
Kangaroo has helped babies thrive.

344
00:18:38,918 --> 00:18:41,152
But look, Karev. Look at
the numbers. Look at this.

345
00:18:41,237 --> 00:18:44,788
- Huh. Heart rate's going up.
- Yeah, it is.

346
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:46,323
And her temperature is normal.

347
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:50,044
Karev, you may have just
kick-started this baby's entire system.

348
00:18:50,146 --> 00:18:52,012
Just by holding her?

349
00:18:53,816 --> 00:18:56,383
- Take off your shirt.
- What? No. Take off your shirt.

350
00:18:56,485 --> 00:18:57,901
No, no.

351
00:18:58,003 --> 00:18:59,503
The Kangaroo hold
is most effective

352
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:01,321
when there's
skin-on-skin contact.

353
00:19:01,423 --> 00:19:04,675
It's usually the mom, but
you're gonna have to do.

354
00:19:04,777 --> 00:19:07,461
I'm not kidding!
Take off your shirt!

355
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:16,487
Looks like you used pretty much
every piece of hardware in the hospital.

356
00:19:16,589 --> 00:19:19,056
Makes you think twice
about shrooming on a roof.

357
00:19:19,141 --> 00:19:21,909
Some mouth on this one. If I
talked to my parents like that...

358
00:19:22,011 --> 00:19:25,830
My father would've... You
don't even want to know.

359
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:30,162
I had perfect grades.
Perfect record.

360
00:19:30,186 --> 00:19:32,546
I said whatever I wanted,
did whatever I wanted.

361
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:34,867
Parents couldn't
do a thing about it.

362
00:19:34,891 --> 00:19:36,851
Wanna hear about my childhood?

363
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:44,882
No? OK. I'll just... think
about it quietly in my own head.

364
00:19:44,984 --> 00:19:47,818
Nail's in. Everything's
tight. Let's take a look.

365
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,990
Fantastic.

366
00:19:53,092 --> 00:19:55,593
End-tidal CO2 just
dropped from 34 to 22.

367
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:57,477
Come on, give me
a break here, Hillary.

368
00:19:57,579 --> 00:19:58,962
She has a new murmur.

369
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:06,459
- An air embolus in her heart.
- - Flood the field with saline.

370
00:20:06,505 --> 00:20:09,806
Bone wax, page Cardio
and set up a chest tray.

371
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:12,059
And put her in
Trendelenburg. I can aspirate it.

372
00:20:12,161 --> 00:20:15,513
No, no. We wait for Cardio
and we try to find the source.

373
00:20:15,615 --> 00:20:18,510
It'll take me 30 seconds. It might
take Cardio half an hour to get here.

374
00:20:18,534 --> 00:20:20,496
I've done this before!
I know what I'm doing!

375
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,630
She could arrest at any moment!

376
00:20:21,654 --> 00:20:24,471
Dr. Yang, no! End of discussion!

377
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:30,461
See, it's the
skin-to-skin contact.

378
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:33,297
The baby can feel
your warmth better,

379
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:35,433
sense your heartbeat better.

380
00:20:35,535 --> 00:20:40,521
See that? The baby's own
heart is picking up in response.

381
00:20:42,191 --> 00:20:43,423
Karev, what are you doing?

382
00:20:43,525 --> 00:20:45,676
He's saving a baby's
life, that's what.

383
00:20:45,778 --> 00:20:48,345
Dr. Bailey, I... Oh.

384
00:20:48,448 --> 00:20:50,314
No shirt. He's wearing no shirt.

385
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:52,544
- Have you started to lactate?
- Bailey made me!

386
00:20:52,568 --> 00:20:56,086
Is this the room for the calendar
shoot? I was told it was downstairs.

387
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:57,738
That's enough. Everybody out.

388
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,673
Let Karev do what
he's doing in private.

389
00:20:59,792 --> 00:21:02,759
- What is he doing, exactly?
- Out.

390
00:21:02,861 --> 00:21:04,478
Out.

391
00:21:11,904 --> 00:21:14,438
This is ridiculous.
You're wasting time here.

392
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:16,184
We should deal with
the heart problem.

393
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:18,559
We're following protocol.
Cardio's on its way,

394
00:21:18,661 --> 00:21:22,279
and we can find the source
of the embolus this way.

395
00:21:32,575 --> 00:21:34,292
Screw it.

396
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:39,646
Dr. Yang, the
patient is not coding.

397
00:21:39,749 --> 00:21:42,633
- You're not qualified
to do this.
- Opening the left chest.

398
00:21:42,735 --> 00:21:44,529
- Yang, really?
- Turn on the fluoro.

399
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:46,798
- Dr. Yang!
- Will someone
step on the fluoro,

400
00:21:46,822 --> 00:21:48,150
or do you want
me to go in blind?

401
00:21:48,174 --> 00:21:50,607
Dr. Yang, put down that scalpel!

402
00:22:00,286 --> 00:22:02,336
- Thank you.
- Cristina!

403
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,966
- Scissors.
- Cristina!

404
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:32,744
- Cristina!
- Cardio's here, Yang.

405
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:34,501
It's done. I'm done.

406
00:22:37,256 --> 00:22:38,536
Air embolus out.

407
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:51,969
- The patient was crashing.
- She was not crashing.

408
00:22:52,071 --> 00:22:54,699
It was a procedure I've done
before. I handled it, she's fine.

409
00:22:54,723 --> 00:22:56,573
What if she wasn't?

410
00:22:56,675 --> 00:22:59,426
You could've lacerated her
heart or cut the phrenic nerve.

411
00:22:59,528 --> 00:23:01,006
She could have
died on that table.

412
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:02,841
It would have been your license!

413
00:23:02,865 --> 00:23:06,066
All so you could
prove what, exactly?

414
00:23:09,055 --> 00:23:12,389
I did it to stabilize the patient.
You were watching her vitals drop.

415
00:23:12,491 --> 00:23:14,225
Waiting for a CT surgeon,

416
00:23:14,327 --> 00:23:16,538
who would have taken a more
minimally invasive approach.

417
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:18,073
I could've done a
thoracotomy myself

418
00:23:18,097 --> 00:23:20,042
if I had thought
it was indicated.

419
00:23:20,066 --> 00:23:21,810
I've been around the
block once or twice!

420
00:23:21,834 --> 00:23:23,579
I kind of know what I'm doing!

421
00:23:23,603 --> 00:23:27,771
- I'm aware of that,
I was just...
- You just thought every...

422
00:23:30,793 --> 00:23:35,863
You just thought everything
would be better if you took charge.

423
00:23:35,965 --> 00:23:37,943
You know I have to
report this to the chief,

424
00:23:37,967 --> 00:23:40,668
at a time when he is scouring
this place for people to fire.

425
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:43,370
Well, he's not gonna fire me.

426
00:23:43,472 --> 00:23:44,871
Oh.

427
00:23:44,973 --> 00:23:47,374
Of course not, 'cause
you're invincible!

428
00:23:47,476 --> 00:23:50,711
He's not firing me because the
last time I did an open thoracotomy

429
00:23:50,813 --> 00:23:53,413
for an embolus was
with him, in his OR.

430
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:55,415
Only he was giving me
words of encouragement,

431
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:57,868
not screaming in my ear!

432
00:24:03,159 --> 00:24:04,919
For the record,
you rocked in there.

433
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:07,005
Hunt's jealous he
didn't do it himself.

434
00:24:07,029 --> 00:24:09,029
Shut up.

435
00:24:13,069 --> 00:24:16,953
OK. You won't believe what
just happened in surgery with...

436
00:24:17,523 --> 00:24:19,973
Hey. You OK?

437
00:24:20,075 --> 00:24:22,359
Tell me I'm great.

438
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:24,821
- What?
- I need for you
to tell me I'm great.

439
00:24:24,897 --> 00:24:28,064
- You're great.
- I mean really tell me.

440
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:29,850
Because I'm about
to go in on a surgery

441
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:31,651
I'm not sure I should
be going in on,

442
00:24:31,754 --> 00:24:33,437
and I can't think
like that, right?

443
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:37,073
I can't go into the
OR feeling like... this.

444
00:24:37,175 --> 00:24:40,577
So... I need you
to tell me I'm great.

445
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:42,979
Make me... Make me hear it.

446
00:24:48,304 --> 00:24:49,836
You are great.

447
00:24:51,507 --> 00:24:56,110
You... are... great.

448
00:24:58,964 --> 00:25:00,764
Thank you.

449
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:06,570
Hey, there. You ready to go?

450
00:25:06,672 --> 00:25:07,999
I'm gonna take you
to the OR myself.

451
00:25:08,023 --> 00:25:10,290
I've been here a while now.

452
00:25:10,392 --> 00:25:15,312
And I've seen kids
go home and go away.

453
00:25:15,414 --> 00:25:19,833
Like Evan, the kid from down
the hall, with asthma, last month?

454
00:25:19,952 --> 00:25:23,436
He died the day before he
was supposed to be discharged.

455
00:25:23,538 --> 00:25:26,539
- You're not Evan.
- And Chloe, the heart girl?

456
00:25:26,642 --> 00:25:29,109
She was here for three
weeks before she died.

457
00:25:29,211 --> 00:25:31,845
- No one says you're gonna die.
- I've been here for seven
months.

458
00:25:31,964 --> 00:25:36,233
I've been here the longest of
anyone on the floor, by double.

459
00:25:38,387 --> 00:25:41,121
- Wallace...
- They say it's
like going to sleep.

460
00:25:41,223 --> 00:25:43,874
Maybe it is.

461
00:25:43,976 --> 00:25:46,843
But what if I go to sleep

462
00:25:46,946 --> 00:25:49,380
and I have nightmares?

463
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:58,855
More traction, please?

464
00:25:58,958 --> 00:26:01,324
Damn it. The
mesentery's really friable.

465
00:26:01,426 --> 00:26:04,360
Percy, a little help
on the suction.

466
00:26:04,463 --> 00:26:05,846
This is not a good idea.

467
00:26:05,948 --> 00:26:09,516
This surgery was
not a good idea.

468
00:26:09,618 --> 00:26:11,785
Can we get a washcloth
for Dr. Robbins?

469
00:26:11,887 --> 00:26:15,439
- No, it's fine.
- Just take a moment.

470
00:26:22,164 --> 00:26:24,180
Thank you.

471
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,834
Pickups, please.

472
00:26:30,172 --> 00:26:33,107
- I left two messages.
- I'm sorry. I was in surgery.

473
00:26:33,209 --> 00:26:35,209
- There were complications.
- I don't care.

474
00:26:35,311 --> 00:26:37,811
I operated on Wallace
tonight when I knew better.

475
00:26:37,913 --> 00:26:39,624
I keep retracing every
step, every suture,

476
00:26:39,648 --> 00:26:42,215
going over it and over it.

477
00:26:42,317 --> 00:26:45,135
- He didn't make it?
- He did. He's in recovery.

478
00:26:45,237 --> 00:26:47,115
Not the point. What I
needed from you tonight

479
00:26:47,139 --> 00:26:49,439
was a little support for
once, and you weren't here.

480
00:26:49,541 --> 00:26:51,074
OK, you're scared.

481
00:26:51,176 --> 00:26:53,127
So you're picking a
fight. You get that, yeah?

482
00:26:53,229 --> 00:26:54,528
Yeah. Yeah, fine. Whatever.

483
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:57,081
But I've helped you
through crisis after crisis,

484
00:26:57,182 --> 00:26:59,483
and once I thought that I
could come here and get...

485
00:26:59,585 --> 00:27:01,997
- Let it go! It's done!
- I have every right to be mad.

486
00:27:02,021 --> 00:27:04,116
You never pulled a stunt like
that with another attending.

487
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:06,890
I seem to recall Callie was
there, she still didn't stop me.

488
00:27:06,992 --> 00:27:09,693
- Guys, not now.
- You took advantage of me

489
00:27:09,778 --> 00:27:12,446
- and of our relationship.
- The kid was dying.

490
00:27:12,548 --> 00:27:14,748
- What kid? What happened?
- You didn't hear?

491
00:27:14,866 --> 00:27:16,667
- No, I didn't.
- Cristina performed

492
00:27:16,769 --> 00:27:20,421
an unauthorized and unnecessary
thoracotomy against my orders.

493
00:27:20,523 --> 00:27:22,822
- She what?
- I saved the patient's life.

494
00:27:22,925 --> 00:27:25,537
- You didn't tell?
- I was going to,
but you were all,

495
00:27:25,561 --> 00:27:28,172
- "Tell me I'm great."
- So it's my fault
Yang went rogue

496
00:27:28,196 --> 00:27:31,664
- on a child?
- It wasn't rogue. It was brilliant.

497
00:27:31,766 --> 00:27:35,802
It wasn't! You know? I'm done.

498
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:37,098
You got lucky today, Cristina,

499
00:27:37,122 --> 00:27:39,184
and you may think
you can get away

500
00:27:39,208 --> 00:27:41,319
with whatever you want,
but one of these days,

501
00:27:41,343 --> 00:27:43,744
that luck is gonna run out.

502
00:27:45,564 --> 00:27:47,898
Look... Wha...?

503
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,784
Oh! OK. So you're leaving, too?

504
00:27:50,886 --> 00:27:53,003
Yes, because I have a patient.

505
00:27:57,659 --> 00:27:58,725
Bitches.

506
00:27:58,827 --> 00:28:00,927
All right, start
an epi drip now.

507
00:28:01,029 --> 00:28:04,280
More irrigation. Keep it coming.
Give me a Babcock clamp.

508
00:28:04,382 --> 00:28:07,584
I can't have a light... Can
somebody get me more light?

509
00:28:08,804 --> 00:28:11,604
Pressure's dropping to
68 over 40. Pulse is racing.

510
00:28:11,724 --> 00:28:14,474
Come on, Wallace.

511
00:28:14,576 --> 00:28:17,155
- What happened
to the Anderson boy?
- He's in septic shock.

512
00:28:17,179 --> 00:28:20,180
His body was too unstable,
what I said in the first place.

513
00:28:20,282 --> 00:28:22,849
- Maybe I can help.
- No! No, you can't.

514
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:25,101
As long as you're
breathing over my shoulder,

515
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:27,031
I feel like I'm operating
on a stack of bills.

516
00:28:27,055 --> 00:28:28,788
25 million dollar bills.

517
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:31,024
What I need to be
invested in is this kid.

518
00:28:31,127 --> 00:28:33,226
So get the hell out of my OR!

519
00:28:34,363 --> 00:28:36,363
More suction now!

520
00:28:50,161 --> 00:28:51,895
How'd it go?

521
00:28:53,215 --> 00:28:54,798
Damn it.

522
00:28:56,968 --> 00:28:59,670
I'll let them know you
did everything you could.

523
00:28:59,772 --> 00:29:03,841
Wait, Dr. Robbins. Don't we have
to tell the parents, let them know...?

524
00:29:03,943 --> 00:29:06,159
- No.
- What do you mean, no?

525
00:29:06,261 --> 00:29:08,111
I mean no.

526
00:29:08,213 --> 00:29:10,280
I will not be speaking
to Wallace's parents.

527
00:29:10,382 --> 00:29:12,449
Mr. Jennings and the
chief will take care of that.

528
00:29:12,551 --> 00:29:14,084
As far as they are concerned

529
00:29:14,186 --> 00:29:16,219
and as far as the
Andersons will be concerned,

530
00:29:16,321 --> 00:29:18,388
I just killed their
son. I'm a liability.

531
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:20,390
Because if they were
to ask me, the truth is,

532
00:29:20,493 --> 00:29:22,792
I'd tell them I did
just kill their son.

533
00:29:22,894 --> 00:29:25,011
And they should
sue. I am responsible.

534
00:29:25,131 --> 00:29:28,665
But that's not in the best
interest of the hospital.

535
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:31,301
- Am I close?
- I think we're
on the same page.

536
00:29:37,977 --> 00:29:42,528
My luck will run out? It
has nothing to do with luck.

537
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:46,233
He's just being an ass.
I rocked that embolus.

538
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:52,856
- What?
- He cares about you.

539
00:29:52,941 --> 00:29:56,843
- So?
- So maybe he's
a little bit right.

540
00:29:56,945 --> 00:29:58,245
I get it.

541
00:29:58,347 --> 00:30:00,525
I mean, I'm dying to get
out of this bed and cut.

542
00:30:00,549 --> 00:30:03,783
But you did an unauthorized
procedure in an OR.

543
00:30:03,902 --> 00:30:06,603
You're an amazing surgeon,
but if anything had gone wrong,

544
00:30:06,705 --> 00:30:07,965
that would have
been your career.

545
00:30:07,989 --> 00:30:09,706
He cares about your career.

546
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:11,958
He's in love with you.

547
00:30:12,961 --> 00:30:15,362
I hate married, happy you.

548
00:30:17,999 --> 00:30:21,601
Go to work. And don't cut
anybody open without permission.

549
00:30:21,703 --> 00:30:25,004
You should have seen Yang in
that surgery. She was fearless.

550
00:30:25,106 --> 00:30:28,341
And you are hopeless. She's
completely out of your league.

551
00:30:28,443 --> 00:30:30,042
I'm hopeless?

552
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:33,580
I'm just stupid.

553
00:30:33,682 --> 00:30:36,550
He's married. And have
I mentioned, a total ass

554
00:30:36,651 --> 00:30:40,887
to pretty much
everyone at all times.

555
00:30:40,989 --> 00:30:44,241
Karev? Did you
stay here all night?

556
00:30:45,427 --> 00:30:47,744
Uh, yeah. I guess I did.

557
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:50,864
Go home, get some rest.
The nurse will take over for you.

558
00:30:50,966 --> 00:30:53,817
No, I'm OK.

559
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:56,002
I'm good here.

560
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:00,907
You'd be good in
Peds, you know that?

561
00:31:01,009 --> 00:31:05,028
You get invested, you
have good instincts,

562
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:07,330
you stick to your instincts.

563
00:31:08,633 --> 00:31:11,401
You'd be good in Peds, Karev.

564
00:31:19,311 --> 00:31:22,846
Yeah, I know, they say I
can have visitors tomorrow.

565
00:31:22,948 --> 00:31:24,748
Cool. And...

566
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:27,417
Do you have any loopies?
Or whatever you have.

567
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:31,371
They only have me on two
milligrams of morphine at a time.

568
00:31:31,473 --> 00:31:33,156
I know. How lame is that?

569
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:37,910
Hey, little pusher girl,
I'm Hillary's doctor,

570
00:31:38,013 --> 00:31:39,679
and now I have Hillary's phone,

571
00:31:39,781 --> 00:31:41,982
so I'm gonna give this
number to the police.

572
00:31:42,084 --> 00:31:43,683
How lame is that?

573
00:31:43,785 --> 00:31:46,602
- What the hell?
- OK.

574
00:31:46,704 --> 00:31:50,240
I know you think you can do anything
and say anything and handle anything.

575
00:31:50,342 --> 00:31:51,541
And that's almost true.

576
00:31:51,643 --> 00:31:54,928
Except for the fact
that you fell off a roof.

577
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:57,130
Because you were
so high, that you, what,

578
00:31:57,232 --> 00:31:59,265
you thought you could fly?

579
00:31:59,368 --> 00:32:02,786
In surgery, you almost
died of a heart complication,

580
00:32:02,888 --> 00:32:05,154
because your body is so
strung out from the crap

581
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:07,218
you've been putting in it
that it almost shut down.

582
00:32:07,242 --> 00:32:10,243
That doesn't make you
smarter than everyone else.

583
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:12,678
It makes you an idiot.

584
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:15,515
The only reason
why you're alive is...

585
00:32:15,617 --> 00:32:17,550
You know what? It's
'cause you're lucky.

586
00:32:17,652 --> 00:32:19,802
So just... grow up.

587
00:32:43,228 --> 00:32:45,345
Surprise!

588
00:32:57,842 --> 00:32:59,009
I...

589
00:33:07,619 --> 00:33:09,602
I... I...

590
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,089
Oh.

591
00:33:18,247 --> 00:33:19,879
Told ya.

592
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:28,521
In retrospect, I realize now
that surprise parties are hostile.

593
00:33:28,623 --> 00:33:31,874
This was a bad idea.
Please, stop crying. I'm sorry.

594
00:33:31,976 --> 00:33:35,678
- I'm sorry about the party.
- Wallace died.

595
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:38,882
He was supposed
to be turning 11 today,

596
00:33:38,984 --> 00:33:41,718
and instead, he's
lying in a morgue.

597
00:33:42,755 --> 00:33:45,856
Oh... God.

598
00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:50,327
Um...

599
00:33:50,429 --> 00:33:51,894
I'm... I'm sorry.

600
00:33:52,797 --> 00:33:55,298
I'm sorry. I can't stay.

601
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,500
No, it's OK. It's OK.
I'll take care of it.

602
00:33:57,603 --> 00:33:59,936
You don't have to stay.
Just... I understand.

603
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:03,006
We're all surgeons.
Everyone will understand.

604
00:34:03,108 --> 00:34:06,376
- All right.
- OK. Just go.

605
00:34:14,653 --> 00:34:17,620
- Might as well
take advantage, huh?
- What?

606
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:21,191
Party's a dud, but at least
there's free booze, right?

607
00:34:21,293 --> 00:34:22,926
Right.

608
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:31,834
Go ahead and gloat. Surprise
parties never come to any good.

609
00:34:31,937 --> 00:34:35,405
- I think this party
speaks for itself.
- I don't get it.

610
00:34:35,507 --> 00:34:37,541
The best birthday of my life

611
00:34:37,642 --> 00:34:39,543
was the surprise party
that my parents threw.

612
00:34:39,644 --> 00:34:42,212
I loved it. So much.

613
00:34:42,314 --> 00:34:44,692
How old were you at this party?

614
00:34:44,716 --> 00:34:47,517
- Seven.
- Mmm. Like I said.

615
00:34:47,619 --> 00:34:49,553
Speaks for itself.

616
00:34:53,858 --> 00:34:57,994
If there's anything we can get
for you, help you with, please,

617
00:34:58,079 --> 00:34:59,545
just let us know.

618
00:34:59,647 --> 00:35:01,447
I'd be happy to
oversee any packing

619
00:35:01,549 --> 00:35:02,966
you need done from his room.

620
00:35:04,019 --> 00:35:06,586
I've already arranged for a car.

621
00:35:06,688 --> 00:35:08,972
It's ready to take
you home anytime.

622
00:35:11,076 --> 00:35:14,177
- Arizona.
- Dr. Robbins, this is
a sensitive time.

623
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:16,746
- Let her be.
- Excuse me?

624
00:35:16,848 --> 00:35:18,381
I said...

625
00:35:18,484 --> 00:35:20,166
let her be.

626
00:35:33,682 --> 00:35:35,148
It just doesn't feel real.

627
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:38,401
Any of it. It just...

628
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:41,621
It just doesn't feel real.

629
00:35:45,877 --> 00:35:47,910
Bethany, would
you like to see him?

630
00:35:59,858 --> 00:36:01,741
I have to admit, I'm impressed.

631
00:36:01,843 --> 00:36:04,260
I never would have pegged
you for the babysitting type.

632
00:36:04,363 --> 00:36:07,430
- Are you heading home?
- No, I got the baby.

633
00:36:07,532 --> 00:36:09,566
I'm sure somebody
else could take a shift.

634
00:36:09,668 --> 00:36:11,867
I can't leave, OK?

635
00:36:14,356 --> 00:36:16,089
Wow.

636
00:36:16,191 --> 00:36:19,392
Are you really so messed up you
can't let one person be nice to you?

637
00:36:19,494 --> 00:36:21,444
Ever?

638
00:36:22,548 --> 00:36:24,548
I can't go.

639
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:27,833
I can't go home, I can't
get Izzie to call me back.

640
00:36:27,935 --> 00:36:30,537
She's gone.

641
00:36:30,639 --> 00:36:33,440
Could be dead, for all I know.

642
00:36:33,541 --> 00:36:37,310
She left me with a
$200,000 medical bill and I...

643
00:36:39,598 --> 00:36:41,897
I can't do anything about it.

644
00:36:42,601 --> 00:36:44,267
About any of it.

645
00:36:44,369 --> 00:36:47,203
But I can sit here and
I can hold this baby.

646
00:36:47,305 --> 00:36:48,838
That I can do.

647
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:55,779
Then I'll sit here with
you for a little while.

648
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,244
Yang! Doctor...

649
00:37:11,346 --> 00:37:14,431
Can I "Cristina" you,
or are we not there yet?

650
00:37:14,533 --> 00:37:15,982
That's a no? OK.

651
00:37:16,084 --> 00:37:19,285
Dr. Yang, let me
just tell you that

652
00:37:19,387 --> 00:37:21,827
that was incredibly
hot in the OR yesterday.

653
00:37:23,124 --> 00:37:25,541
Very, deeply hot. It
was hot! You are hot.

654
00:37:26,878 --> 00:37:28,361
You're drunk and
you're in my room.

655
00:37:28,463 --> 00:37:30,780
I am in fact inebriated,

656
00:37:30,882 --> 00:37:33,516
but it's legal, you know,
and even if I wasn't,

657
00:37:33,619 --> 00:37:37,587
you're the rule-breaker, which I
think we established in surgery.

658
00:37:37,689 --> 00:37:39,455
Really? You think that was hot?

659
00:37:42,127 --> 00:37:44,305
Would it be really,
really bad if I just...

660
00:37:44,329 --> 00:37:46,174
'Cause of the embolus thing,

661
00:37:46,198 --> 00:37:49,031
and you in general,
could I just...?

662
00:37:52,487 --> 00:37:54,320
Uh, no! I'm involved.

663
00:37:55,290 --> 00:37:57,290
I'm involved.

664
00:38:03,965 --> 00:38:05,782
Time to meet your mommy.

665
00:38:13,391 --> 00:38:16,826
She's so beautiful.

666
00:38:23,885 --> 00:38:28,288
<i>They say the bigger your
investment, the bigger your return.</i>

667
00:38:36,515 --> 00:38:38,898
- Surgery yesterday?
- Mm-hmm.

668
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,833
It wasn't just...

669
00:38:43,287 --> 00:38:45,755
It was me. Can't you see that?

670
00:38:45,857 --> 00:38:47,173
See what?

671
00:38:48,493 --> 00:38:49,959
See what? I...

672
00:38:52,914 --> 00:38:55,331
I can't just ignore what
happened, Cristina.

673
00:38:57,752 --> 00:38:59,585
OK.

674
00:39:02,323 --> 00:39:05,341
I'm sorry. Look, I know, um...

675
00:39:05,443 --> 00:39:07,410
I know I overstepped.

676
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:12,098
Come home with me.

677
00:39:12,868 --> 00:39:14,200
Please?

678
00:39:14,302 --> 00:39:17,470
<i>But you have to be
willing to take a chance.</i>

679
00:39:19,273 --> 00:39:20,673
OK.

680
00:39:53,325 --> 00:39:56,175
Bad dreams, bad dreams, go away.

681
00:39:56,277 --> 00:39:59,312
Good dreams, good
dreams, here to stay.

682
00:40:03,668 --> 00:40:07,069
Good dreams, good
dreams, here to stay.

683
00:40:07,171 --> 00:40:10,023
Bad dreams, bad dreams, go away.

684
00:40:10,125 --> 00:40:13,059
Good dreams, good
dreams, here to stay.

685
00:40:13,161 --> 00:40:15,979
Bad dreams, bad dreams, go away.

686
00:40:16,081 --> 00:40:18,981
Good dreams, good
dreams, here to stay.

687
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:20,817
Stay.

688
00:40:24,772 --> 00:40:27,690
- You have to do it three times for...
- - For it to work.

689
00:40:28,793 --> 00:40:29,842
I know.

690
00:40:34,148 --> 00:40:38,601
She is the reason that
we will still be giving

691
00:40:38,703 --> 00:40:44,623
Seattle Grace Mercy
West 25 million dollars.

692
00:40:44,726 --> 00:40:48,527
Not because of you
or your ass kissing.

693
00:40:51,032 --> 00:40:53,616
It's because of her... her.

694
00:40:58,072 --> 00:41:00,706
<i>You have to understand...</i>

695
00:41:00,808 --> 00:41:02,775
<i>you might lose it all.</i>

696
00:41:09,617 --> 00:41:11,517
The chief still
won't talk to me.

697
00:41:11,619 --> 00:41:13,286
He will.

698
00:41:13,388 --> 00:41:15,955
When did you become
such an optimist?

699
00:41:16,057 --> 00:41:18,224
This is married, happy me.

700
00:41:18,326 --> 00:41:20,960
Can we...? Are you OK to...?

701
00:41:21,062 --> 00:41:22,428
Yes, we can.

702
00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:24,007
<i>But if you take that chance...</i>

703
00:41:24,031 --> 00:41:26,865
- Are you healed?
- I'm healed.

704
00:41:34,809 --> 00:41:37,376
<i>If you invest wisely...</i>

705
00:41:38,613 --> 00:41:41,547
<i>the payoff might
just surprise you.</i>

706
00:41:41,649 --> 00:41:45,351
Oh! I'm awake!
I'm... See? I'm...

707
00:41:45,453 --> 00:41:49,272
I'm totally awake.
I'm... There's... hats!

708
00:41:49,374 --> 00:41:52,074
And gifts! And... And donuts!

709
00:41:52,177 --> 00:41:54,877
And lingerie.

710
00:41:57,048 --> 00:41:58,247
Really?

711
00:42:01,553 --> 00:42:03,769
I love you.

712
00:42:09,611 --> 00:42:10,826
You do?

713
00:42:12,597 --> 00:42:14,129
I do.

714
00:42:20,238 --> 00:42:22,588
I love you, too.
