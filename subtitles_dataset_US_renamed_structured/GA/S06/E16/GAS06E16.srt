1
00:00:09,526 --> 00:00:12,077
<i>Surgeons are detail-oriented.</i>

2
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:17,449
<i>We like statistics and checklists
and operating procedures.</i>

3
00:00:17,551 --> 00:00:20,936
<i>Our patients live because
we enjoy following the steps.</i>

4
00:00:21,038 --> 00:00:25,691
<i>But as much as we'd love to
always rely on the numbers, the plan,</i>

5
00:00:25,793 --> 00:00:28,727
<i>we also know that some of
the greatest medical discoveries</i>

6
00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:31,196
<i>have happened by accident.</i>

7
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:42,274
- Karev, you still
need a lift...?
- Oh, my God!

8
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:45,044
- What are you doing?! Get out!
- Uh...

9
00:00:45,146 --> 00:00:47,629
- Why are you naked?
- I should go.

10
00:00:47,731 --> 00:00:52,884
Oh, God... No, please, don't be
mad. Derek was supposed to be Alex.

11
00:00:52,986 --> 00:00:54,703
OK, well, Alex left
ten minutes ago.

12
00:00:54,805 --> 00:00:56,283
Since when are you two still...?

13
00:00:56,307 --> 00:00:58,090
Since you caught
us the first time.

14
00:00:58,192 --> 00:01:00,609
Mm-hm. Lexie, this is
Alex we're talking about.

15
00:01:00,711 --> 00:01:03,028
Emotionally, he's like
me three years ago.

16
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:05,647
You can't be having feelings
for him. You realize that?

17
00:01:05,749 --> 00:01:10,235
Of course not. No, it's just
sex. There's no feelings involved.

18
00:01:10,337 --> 00:01:14,973
Right, because you are
a no-feelings type of girl.

19
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:17,525
Your heart lives in your vagina.

20
00:01:17,627 --> 00:01:21,396
It does not. I swear. It's...

21
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:24,283
- Not this time.
- OK.

22
00:01:24,885 --> 00:01:26,951
Sure.

23
00:01:27,053 --> 00:01:30,722
My heart does not
live in my... vagina!

24
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,972
<i>Mold, penicillin.</i>

25
00:01:35,996 --> 00:01:39,748
<i>Poisonous tree bark,
a cure for malaria.</i>

26
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:43,485
<i>A little blue pill for high blood
pressure, impotence be damned.</i>

27
00:01:43,587 --> 00:01:46,821
What's going on? Huh?

28
00:01:49,426 --> 00:01:51,093
- Oh, my God!
- Dude!

29
00:01:51,195 --> 00:01:52,761
Why is this my morning?

30
00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:55,196
So I flip the patient
into Trendelenburg,

31
00:01:55,298 --> 00:01:58,011
Teddy yanks out
the arterial cannula, -

32
00:01:58,035 --> 00:02:00,669
connects the arterial line
to a venous line, and then

33
00:02:00,771 --> 00:02:02,704
sets up retrograde
cerebral perfusion.

34
00:02:02,806 --> 00:02:08,509
I mean, she was on fire, I was
on fire, the whole OR was on fire.

35
00:02:10,914 --> 00:02:12,213
What?

36
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:14,482
Nothing, nothing.

37
00:02:14,585 --> 00:02:18,653
Just... you two are...
You two are friends now.

38
00:02:18,755 --> 00:02:22,223
Yeah. Hey, you know...

39
00:02:22,325 --> 00:02:25,260
you can be her friend, too.
I never asked you not to be.

40
00:02:25,362 --> 00:02:28,062
You decided that
all on your own.

41
00:02:28,164 --> 00:02:30,615
So be her friend.

42
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:33,663
<i>It's hard for us to accept that
it's not always the hard work...</i>

43
00:02:33,687 --> 00:02:35,821
- Thank you.
<i>- Or attention to detail</i>

44
00:02:35,923 --> 00:02:37,843
<i>that'll get us the
answers we're looking for.</i>

45
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:40,492
Dr. Hunt! I... I just paged you.

46
00:02:40,578 --> 00:02:43,412
There's a trauma
on the way. Here it is.

47
00:02:43,514 --> 00:02:46,381
We got a 41-year-old motorcycle
daredevil with a closed head wound,

48
00:02:46,483 --> 00:02:49,267
penetrating neck wound
and multiple blunt trauma.

49
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:51,831
- What was the dare?
- Riding without
a helmet, apparently.

50
00:02:51,855 --> 00:02:54,489
He's still got some
brainwaves left, but barely.

51
00:02:54,591 --> 00:03:00,095
<i>That sometimes we just have to sit back,
relax and wait for the happy accident.</i>

52
00:03:00,197 --> 00:03:02,363
- Oh, my God!
- That isn't gonna help.

53
00:03:05,218 --> 00:03:08,019
- I'm on Trauma. This one's mine.
- I touched him first.

54
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:11,807
Gary from legal. I need a statement
from one of you about that fall.

55
00:03:11,909 --> 00:03:14,387
- You two decide.
- You're not
even wearing scrubs.

56
00:03:14,411 --> 00:03:18,797
- Damn it! This is not over.
- Have fun with Gary from legal.

57
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:24,052
OK.

58
00:03:24,154 --> 00:03:26,588
One, two, three.

59
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:29,191
Teddy, hey, I have an
old patient up in oncology,

60
00:03:29,293 --> 00:03:35,330
and I know you're really busy with
surgeries and... staring at Owen Hunt.

61
00:03:35,432 --> 00:03:38,099
- What?
- I've tried to ignore it,
the staring,

62
00:03:38,201 --> 00:03:40,863
but since Christmas with the
guitar and singing and stolen looks.

63
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:44,106
Well, I noticed it and
I can't un-notice it.

64
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:45,590
It's just, I kind of...

65
00:03:45,676 --> 00:03:48,977
Well, I like to fix things.
People. I like to fix people.

66
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:52,297
- Oh, no. Dr. Hunt and I...
- Don't.

67
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:55,000
'Cause then you're just
lying, and that's no good.

68
00:03:55,085 --> 00:03:57,819
My point is, you're
staring and you're sad

69
00:03:57,921 --> 00:04:00,041
and I think you need
friends that aren't Owen.

70
00:04:00,107 --> 00:04:04,292
That's where I come in, with the
fixing. You're going to be friends with me.

71
00:04:04,394 --> 00:04:06,461
- I am?
- Yeah. I'm an awesome friend.

72
00:04:06,563 --> 00:04:09,464
So tonight you come out
with Callie and me. Girls night.

73
00:04:09,566 --> 00:04:12,951
Oh... Ooh. Maybe
Bailey'll come, too.

74
00:04:13,053 --> 00:04:15,069
Huh.

75
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:18,306
- Say yes to girls night.
- Yes to girls night.

76
00:04:18,408 --> 00:04:19,835
- Yay!
- Oh, yay.

77
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:22,077
Problem solved. Now,
for my patient, Elliot Meyer.

78
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:24,145
- He needs a lung transplant.
- Oh, hey!

79
00:04:24,248 --> 00:04:26,547
Uh, I'm down with
a lung transplant.

80
00:04:26,649 --> 00:04:30,702
Oh. No, you slept with my girlfriend
and I find that when I look at you,

81
00:04:30,804 --> 00:04:34,255
- I want to hit you
with a brick.
- That was, like, years ago.

82
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:37,409
Maybe. But jealousy is
a green-eyed monster,

83
00:04:37,511 --> 00:04:40,845
and, if you ask any one of my kids,
there's no reasoning with a monster.

84
00:04:41,731 --> 00:04:43,698
Dude, run away
before I find a brick.

85
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:47,936
As my new friend,
don't judge me for that.

86
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:50,105
So, my patient...

87
00:04:50,207 --> 00:04:52,574
I get it, you're upset
Little Sloan is gone.

88
00:04:52,676 --> 00:04:55,376
But screwing drug reps is
not gonna make you feel better.

89
00:04:55,478 --> 00:04:58,012
Yeah, it is.

90
00:04:58,115 --> 00:05:01,516
No screwing drug reps in
my hospital. Are we clear?

91
00:05:01,618 --> 00:05:04,138
You were much more
fun when you weren't chief.

92
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:05,820
Get out of here.

93
00:05:05,923 --> 00:05:09,925
Ah, Dr. Webber, welcome back.

94
00:05:10,027 --> 00:05:13,328
- Thank you, Dr. Sloan.
- Richard, how's your
first day back?

95
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:16,914
Oh, well, so far so good.

96
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,351
- I had to drop this off.
- I'm sorry you have to do this.

97
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:23,821
Drug testing is part
of the rehab program.

98
00:05:23,923 --> 00:05:26,658
- Just run it under a John Doe.
- Of course.

99
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,776
Whatever you need
today. And I mean that.

100
00:05:28,878 --> 00:05:32,781
A low stress day,
let's start there.

101
00:05:32,883 --> 00:05:35,650
Routine surgeries, a light
schedule, home by five.

102
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:37,102
Done.

103
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,927
Yeah, I said that. She slipped.

104
00:05:46,029 --> 00:05:49,264
The only person liable here is
you for keeping me from my surgery.

105
00:05:49,366 --> 00:05:52,534
Call my driver and tell him
there's still time to make my flight

106
00:05:52,636 --> 00:05:54,947
- if he comes straight here.
- You passed out in a restaurant

107
00:05:54,971 --> 00:05:57,199
and you have abdominal pain.
You're not getting on a plane.

108
00:05:57,223 --> 00:06:00,208
The pain's gone. Whatever's
caused it can wait till I get home.

109
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:02,978
- Let me off of this thing.
- We're done here, right?

110
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,830
Sir, I need you to
move to this gurney.

111
00:06:05,933 --> 00:06:08,044
I've got this.
You're not in scrubs.

112
00:06:08,068 --> 00:06:09,462
You need to stay calm so I
can do a proper examination.

113
00:06:09,486 --> 00:06:11,131
Tell this lady to
back off, Jackie.

114
00:06:11,155 --> 00:06:13,588
- Jackie?
- Whatever. That's not...

115
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:15,890
Look, I already paged
Bailey. He's not cardio.

116
00:06:15,992 --> 00:06:18,659
- You can lose interest.
- We'll see about that.

117
00:06:18,761 --> 00:06:21,546
Sir, I'm a surgeon.
A very good one.

118
00:06:21,648 --> 00:06:24,632
So is my grandson. So why
don't you take your hands off me.

119
00:06:24,734 --> 00:06:26,818
- He's your grandfather?
- I can handle this

120
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,881
- till Bailey gets here.
- No, you're not allowed

121
00:06:28,905 --> 00:06:31,956
to treat family. He has mid-epigastric
tenderness and guarding.

122
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:35,477
- It could be
ascending cholangitis.
- Ascending cholangitis? Really?

123
00:06:35,579 --> 00:06:38,362
With only one of the
symptoms of Charcot's triad?

124
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:44,286
- You're a doctor?
- Apparently a much
better one than you.

125
00:06:44,387 --> 00:06:48,990
Dr. Harper Avery.
And your name, doctor?

126
00:06:49,092 --> 00:06:53,478
- Harper Avery?
- Uh, no, that's my name.

127
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,147
- As in the Harper Avery Award?
- Bingo.

128
00:06:56,249 --> 00:07:00,751
Get a new surgeon, Jackie.
One with a pulse this time.

129
00:07:00,853 --> 00:07:03,688
You're Harper Avery's grandson?

130
00:07:05,859 --> 00:07:08,643
I misdiagnosed Harper
Avery. In front of Harper Avery.

131
00:07:08,745 --> 00:07:11,841
Know what that does to my chances
of one day winning a Harper Avery?

132
00:07:11,865 --> 00:07:14,933
He could die before then.
He could die today even.

133
00:07:15,035 --> 00:07:18,103
I need to operate on my
motorcycle daredevil and I'll be fine.

134
00:07:18,205 --> 00:07:20,365
Is it true Harper Avery's here?

135
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:24,142
So Derek walked in on her
naked this morning in Alex's bed.

136
00:07:24,244 --> 00:07:25,977
Meredith! God!

137
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:29,114
I'm just cheering her up. She's
having a bad day. Be generous.

138
00:07:29,216 --> 00:07:31,449
You know what? You can't
be having feelings for Karev.

139
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:34,151
- He's like Meredith
three years ago.
- I said that.

140
00:07:34,221 --> 00:07:36,065
I don't have feelings for Alex.

141
00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:38,256
You do. Your
heart's in your vagina.

142
00:07:38,358 --> 00:07:41,359
- I said that!
- You are both monsters.

143
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:44,340
Yang, I heard you
met Harper Avery.

144
00:07:44,364 --> 00:07:46,731
Did you know that Pretty
Boy's grandfather was God?

145
00:07:46,816 --> 00:07:48,816
I didn't know. That's
kinda cool, though.

146
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:51,902
No, it's not cool. He's an
entitled brat with no skills,

147
00:07:52,005 --> 00:07:54,973
- except a really
good bloodline.
- It is not Jackson's fault

148
00:07:55,075 --> 00:07:57,158
that he's related
to Harper Avery.

149
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:59,560
Whatever, Ellis Grey's daughter.

150
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,460
- Huh?
- How do I look?

151
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:05,962
- Chiefly?
- What, are you nervous?

152
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:08,319
He's one of the most powerful
surgeons in the country.

153
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:11,706
He's just a guy who happens to
have an award named after him.

154
00:08:11,808 --> 00:08:14,692
Whatever, Ellis Grey's daughter.
Admit it, you wanna meet him, too.

155
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:15,977
Hell, yeah.

156
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,913
Hey. Where are we on him?

157
00:08:19,015 --> 00:08:21,500
On his way to the OR
and he started bleeding out.

158
00:08:21,602 --> 00:08:23,842
- Wanna give us
a hand here, Yang?
- Oh.

159
00:08:23,937 --> 00:08:26,654
Big boy needs a
little help. No problem.

160
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:29,624
Watch and learn. Clamp.

161
00:08:29,743 --> 00:08:32,660
- This is why I don't
want you to drive!
- I had to get my medication!

162
00:08:32,763 --> 00:08:36,530
- The store was gonna close!
- I'm sorry,
can we not yell, maybe?

163
00:08:36,632 --> 00:08:39,133
No, actually. My mother's
almost completely deaf,

164
00:08:39,235 --> 00:08:43,304
a fact she refuses to accept, which
is why she won't learn sign language

165
00:08:43,406 --> 00:08:45,440
or get a hearing
aid. So we yell.

166
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:49,661
- Don't talk to her! Talk to me!
- I'm telling them what
happened!

167
00:08:49,762 --> 00:08:51,396
She stole my car. Again.

168
00:08:51,498 --> 00:08:54,616
There's tenderness over the
zygomatic process and hematoma

169
00:08:54,718 --> 00:08:56,951
- to the left temporal area.
- Run a head and face CT.

170
00:08:57,053 --> 00:08:59,531
I'll get Sloan and Shepherd. She's
got a ruptured tendon in her knee

171
00:08:59,555 --> 00:09:02,457
that will need surgery. So she'll
be off her feet for a few weeks.

172
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:04,492
So more waiting on
her hand and foot?

173
00:09:05,445 --> 00:09:08,046
- Brilliant.
- I saw that, Kathy!

174
00:09:08,148 --> 00:09:10,498
They're taking you for
scans! That's all we said!

175
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,918
So quiet down, let the
nice doctor do her work!

176
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,700
Why is this taking so long?

177
00:09:15,789 --> 00:09:18,656
Is it me or are those two
women terribly annoying?

178
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:21,626
My apologies. We're working on
getting you up to your own room

179
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:24,362
- as soon as possible.
- You said that before.

180
00:09:24,464 --> 00:09:28,483
Are you the same Shepherd who
did the clinical trial on the gliomas?

181
00:09:28,584 --> 00:09:31,152
- Yes, sir.
- You brought me a neurosurgeon

182
00:09:31,254 --> 00:09:34,172
- for some abdominal cramps?
- No, I...

183
00:09:34,274 --> 00:09:36,875
Dr. Shepherd is our
chief of surgery, sir.

184
00:09:36,977 --> 00:09:40,078
I don't need a cruise director. I
need an experienced surgeon.

185
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,963
Page Dr. Grey.

186
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,783
I'm Dr. Grey.

187
00:09:47,237 --> 00:09:50,538
Either the world's most talented
plastic surgeon works here,

188
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:55,559
- or you're not Ellis Grey.
- She was my mother. She passed away.

189
00:09:56,913 --> 00:09:58,279
Oh.

190
00:09:59,082 --> 00:10:02,616
I didn't know. My condolences.

191
00:10:02,719 --> 00:10:06,537
Who else then? Does
Richard Webber still work here?

192
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,306
Yes, uh...

193
00:10:08,408 --> 00:10:11,209
Unfortunately, he is...
He is not available today.

194
00:10:11,311 --> 00:10:13,272
Push two of Ativan!
Percy, get him on his side.

195
00:10:13,296 --> 00:10:15,263
- Cristina, watch that neck.
- Oh, my God!

196
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:18,750
- What are they doing
to that man?!
- OK!

197
00:10:18,852 --> 00:10:22,137
- Applying pressure...
- I'll page Dr. Webber.

198
00:10:26,426 --> 00:10:29,760
As you can see,
you've got dilated bowel

199
00:10:29,863 --> 00:10:33,614
here and here,
indicating an obstruction.

200
00:10:33,717 --> 00:10:37,118
It's good thing that our young
Dr. Avery brought you straight in.

201
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,704
Dr. Bailey can do
the surgery right away.

202
00:10:39,789 --> 00:10:41,840
Was it a student, Webber?

203
00:10:42,893 --> 00:10:45,493
A board member's wife?

204
00:10:45,595 --> 00:10:47,262
- What?
- No one gives up

205
00:10:47,364 --> 00:10:48,646
a chief of surgery gig.

206
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:51,415
And they don't oust you
unless it's for something juicy.

207
00:10:51,518 --> 00:10:54,219
- So who were you
slipping it to?
- Grandpa!

208
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:58,940
- I'm sorry, Dr. Webber.
- It was a joke. He doesn't get me.

209
00:10:59,042 --> 00:11:00,574
So, Webber?

210
00:11:00,676 --> 00:11:03,294
Dr. Webber decided
to focus on his research.

211
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:06,948
Oh, the "research"
line. Well, either way,

212
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:09,717
at least you'll be
free to do my surgery.

213
00:11:09,819 --> 00:11:12,720
Dr. Bailey is more than capable
of performing the surgery.

214
00:11:12,822 --> 00:11:14,605
I want Webber.

215
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:17,475
- No offense.
- None taken.

216
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:20,044
And I want to watch.

217
00:11:21,548 --> 00:11:24,048
- What?
- I'm going to be awake
for my surgery.

218
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,150
Watch.

219
00:11:27,788 --> 00:11:29,503
So much for the low stress day.

220
00:11:32,676 --> 00:11:35,543
A year after Mr. Meyer's
lymphoma went into remission,

221
00:11:35,645 --> 00:11:37,795
he was diagnosed
with pulmonary fibrosis,

222
00:11:37,897 --> 00:11:40,714
a condition he developed
as a side effect to the radiation

223
00:11:40,816 --> 00:11:42,666
he received during
cancer treatment.

224
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:44,247
This isn't new information.

225
00:11:44,271 --> 00:11:46,111
I thought you said
they could help.

226
00:11:46,189 --> 00:11:49,673
But they're new to the case. It's
important to review the entire history.

227
00:11:49,776 --> 00:11:51,736
Great. Can't you do
that on your own time?

228
00:11:51,828 --> 00:11:55,296
Jill. Sorry. My sister usually
waits a few more minutes

229
00:11:55,398 --> 00:11:57,415
before going full
bitch on you guys.

230
00:11:57,501 --> 00:12:00,301
All right. Let me
tell you what I know.

231
00:12:00,403 --> 00:12:03,838
It is gonna be very difficult
to find you a new set of lungs.

232
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,557
Donor lungs are scarce.

233
00:12:05,659 --> 00:12:08,538
Eighty-five percent get thrown
out because they get too inflamed

234
00:12:08,562 --> 00:12:12,881
while the donor is brain-dead. And
because your cancer could come back

235
00:12:12,983 --> 00:12:15,533
with the immunosuppressants
you'd be on,

236
00:12:15,635 --> 00:12:19,037
you are considered a
very high-risk candidate.

237
00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:22,790
There are just too many other
patients on the list that are lower risk.

238
00:12:22,892 --> 00:12:26,494
Elliot survived
leukemia and lymphoma.

239
00:12:26,596 --> 00:12:31,116
Nobody does that, but
he did. He deserves lungs.

240
00:12:31,218 --> 00:12:35,202
Unfortunately, these are the
rules the transplant board sets out.

241
00:12:35,304 --> 00:12:36,804
I...

242
00:12:38,107 --> 00:12:40,041
I'm sorry.

243
00:12:42,245 --> 00:12:45,229
Have you looked into the research
they're doing with ex vivo transplants?

244
00:12:45,332 --> 00:12:48,165
- Ex vivo?
- It's a procedure
where they take

245
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:52,069
damaged donor lungs, ones we'd normally
throw away, and repair them on bypass.

246
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:53,931
- Are we doing one?
- Let me guess.

247
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:57,108
You want on my service to make up
for the fact that you humiliated yourself

248
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:59,727
- in front of Harper Avery.
- How'd you hear about that?

249
00:12:59,829 --> 00:13:03,631
- You made fun of me.
- OK.

250
00:13:03,733 --> 00:13:07,384
Fine, yes, I humiliated
myself in front of Harper Avery.

251
00:13:07,487 --> 00:13:10,655
And my daredevil gorked
before we could operate on him.

252
00:13:10,757 --> 00:13:14,442
So I am available for
your ex vivo lung case.

253
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:18,913
I don't have an ex vivo lung case. It's
only been done in Switzerland and Canada

254
00:13:19,015 --> 00:13:21,449
on patients in much better
shape than our patient.

255
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:26,421
Yes, but... performing a
procedure as hardcore as this,

256
00:13:26,523 --> 00:13:30,374
while Harper Avery is in the
hospital, well, he could hear about it

257
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:32,622
and like it. And he's a
god who hands out awards.

258
00:13:32,646 --> 00:13:35,313
- I don't care about awards.
- Only people who never
win awards

259
00:13:35,415 --> 00:13:36,655
ever say that.

260
00:13:39,903 --> 00:13:41,697
This could be an
ex vivo lung case?

261
00:13:41,721 --> 00:13:43,888
I do not have feelings for Alex.

262
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:46,891
I do not care.

263
00:13:54,067 --> 00:13:55,566
Here we go.

264
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:58,736
- He's giving them the speech.
- What speech?

265
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:01,372
About the wonders of medicine.

266
00:14:01,474 --> 00:14:04,759
About how, as surgeons,
we're meant to push boundaries,

267
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:08,128
- and do what
no one has ever done.
- Sounds motivating.

268
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:10,426
It's cheesy, is what it is.

269
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:12,884
You hear it enough times at
your grandparents' dinner table,

270
00:14:12,986 --> 00:14:15,803
you can't help but wanna be
a surgeon when you grow up.

271
00:14:15,905 --> 00:14:19,206
You had a dinner table? I didn't know
world-class surgeons had dinner tables.

272
00:14:19,308 --> 00:14:20,575
I feel gypped.

273
00:14:20,677 --> 00:14:22,688
That's 'cause you haven't
heard the speech yet.

274
00:14:22,712 --> 00:14:26,981
To be awake for my own
surgery? An opportunity like this?

275
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:30,351
To be a student again,
get a new perspective.

276
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:33,437
It's what we got into this
business for in the first place.

277
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:36,541
Those moments that
challenge and terrify and dare us

278
00:14:36,643 --> 00:14:40,110
to reach the potential that
we were meant to reach.

279
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:45,649
So let's stop the talk and get
into that OR and teach those kids,

280
00:14:45,751 --> 00:14:47,535
teach ourselves...

281
00:14:48,671 --> 00:14:51,522
what it means to be great.

282
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:57,494
I'm sorry, I can't authorize
an awake surgery, no matter...

283
00:14:57,597 --> 00:15:00,147
We can do it.

284
00:15:00,249 --> 00:15:04,284
- Derek, we can do this.
- - That's what I like to hear.

285
00:15:04,387 --> 00:15:09,641
That's the way a chief does
things. Shepherd, take note.

286
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:21,146
- Dr. Webber.
- Derek.

287
00:15:21,221 --> 00:15:23,315
- I know what
you're going to say...
- No.

288
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:26,285
As the sole person in this hospital
assigned to look out for your welfare,

289
00:15:26,309 --> 00:15:28,829
I don't support this decision.

290
00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:36,033
I apologize... Chief Shepherd.

291
00:15:40,073 --> 00:15:43,057
- You really
wanna do this thing?
- I do.

292
00:15:47,314 --> 00:15:49,063
It's on you then.

293
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:53,968
Thank you for your
help on that project.

294
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:56,671
- Same time tomorrow?
- Yeah.

295
00:15:59,008 --> 00:16:01,275
Oh, let me guess. Still
no call from Little Sloan?

296
00:16:01,378 --> 00:16:03,277
Nothing. But it's
OK. I've moved on.

297
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:07,749
OK, yeah, getting out of bed and not
wearing sweats around the apartment

298
00:16:07,851 --> 00:16:12,186
all day is a sign of progress.
Sleeping with the nurses? Not so much.

299
00:16:12,288 --> 00:16:15,256
I wouldn't have to sleep
with nurses if you'd put out.

300
00:16:15,358 --> 00:16:17,725
I'm in a committed,
loving, adult relationship.

301
00:16:17,827 --> 00:16:20,261
- Tried that. Didn't work.
- OK, whatever.

302
00:16:20,363 --> 00:16:23,597
Just come take a look at this
face CT on my patient. Come on!

303
00:16:27,953 --> 00:16:30,488
Get the hell out of here, Karev!

304
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:33,190
- What?
- Get the hell out! Now!

305
00:16:35,461 --> 00:16:37,594
- What was that?
- I don't like that guy.

306
00:16:37,697 --> 00:16:39,981
He slept with Lexie once,
Mark. You two were broken up.

307
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:42,850
Actually, he's... Never mind.

308
00:16:42,952 --> 00:16:45,672
You don't sleep with another
man's girl. I learned that the hard way.

309
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:48,723
- Well played.
- Don't buy that. He's acting out

310
00:16:48,824 --> 00:16:51,275
because he can't deal with
the human emotions he's having.

311
00:16:51,377 --> 00:16:53,497
Ask him how many
nurses he's slept with today.

312
00:16:53,529 --> 00:16:55,769
- You're sleeping with nurses?
- You said no drug reps.

313
00:16:55,865 --> 00:16:57,849
And I'm a grown man! I
can screw whoever I want!

314
00:16:57,951 --> 00:17:00,985
- Not in my hospital.
- What are you gonna do, fire me?

315
00:17:01,087 --> 00:17:03,404
- Maybe I will.
- Enough with the testosterone.

316
00:17:03,506 --> 00:17:06,557
- Mrs. Nelson's scans are up.
- No bleed, no fracture.

317
00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:09,327
- She's good.
- She's deaf.

318
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:12,312
- Yeah. How'd you know that?
- She's got otosclerosis.

319
00:17:12,414 --> 00:17:14,894
Abnormal bone growth in the
middle ear. If I remove the bones,

320
00:17:14,918 --> 00:17:18,352
- she'll be able to hear again.
- You can restore her hearing?

321
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:20,420
- Yeah.
- But she's been deaf for years.

322
00:17:20,523 --> 00:17:23,524
- Yeah, she doesn't have to be.
- Just because you remove
the bone?

323
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:26,693
What did I just say? She
doesn't have to be deaf anymore.

324
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:31,565
I can fix it. I'm that good.
You still wanna fire me?

325
00:17:35,805 --> 00:17:37,965
Not a bad-looking
bowel, is it, Webber?

326
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,960
No, sir. If I had to guess,

327
00:17:40,009 --> 00:17:43,143
I would say it was the
bowel of a 50-year-old.

328
00:17:43,245 --> 00:17:46,630
- Suction, Dr. Grey.
- Dr. Grey.

329
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:49,317
I've got a question for you.

330
00:17:49,419 --> 00:17:52,419
- It's of a personal nature.
- Yes, sir?

331
00:17:53,355 --> 00:17:56,023
If your mother was
still working here,

332
00:17:56,125 --> 00:18:00,111
would you have chosen
to study at a different,

333
00:18:00,213 --> 00:18:02,813
lesser quality hospital
in order to avoid

334
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:06,283
the advantages of her legacy?

335
00:18:07,737 --> 00:18:10,455
I'm waiting here, Dr. Grey.

336
00:18:10,974 --> 00:18:12,205
Um...

337
00:18:12,307 --> 00:18:15,326
Dr. Webber, what do you
think about intraoperational dye

338
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:18,129
to help determine
intestinal viability?

339
00:18:18,231 --> 00:18:22,583
Well, they say that it enhances
clinical judgment. I'm not really sure.

340
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:24,679
I don't get it. Why
does he get to scrub in

341
00:18:24,703 --> 00:18:26,888
on his own grandfather's
awake surgery?

342
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:30,841
The same reason Harper Avery
personally requested Meredith Grey

343
00:18:30,944 --> 00:18:33,594
- to be his resident.
- Nepotism sucks.

344
00:18:35,031 --> 00:18:38,599
Hey, you wanna go grab a bite?

345
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:42,770
No. Actually, I am full.

346
00:18:42,872 --> 00:18:45,017
Really? 'Cause you
didn't seem full last night.

347
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:48,526
I said no! OK? I'm
not hungry. At all.

348
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:53,647
- So just go eat alone.
- Excuse me. Sorry.

349
00:18:56,935 --> 00:19:02,456
- Hey! Down in front, bigfoot.
- It's bigfoot now?

350
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:06,927
Well, you know what they
say about guys with big feet.

351
00:19:07,029 --> 00:19:09,814
Shouldn't you be off
learning how to be a surgeon

352
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:14,668
- after you let
my daredevil die?
- My daredevil? He didn't die.

353
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:17,571
After you left, I personally
helped preserve his heart function.

354
00:19:17,673 --> 00:19:19,957
Now, he's an organ donor.

355
00:19:32,622 --> 00:19:35,372
- BP's dropping!
- I think I've got
a bleeder. Suction.

356
00:19:35,474 --> 00:19:38,058
- Did you check the SMA?
- Yes. It's OK.

357
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,277
- Dr. Avery, stay calm.
- I'll be calm

358
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:41,963
when you find the damn thing.

359
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:48,936
What's going on, Kathy?

360
00:19:49,471 --> 00:19:50,771
You're serious?

361
00:19:50,873 --> 00:19:53,068
All this time I just needed
to make her go to the doctor?

362
00:19:53,092 --> 00:19:56,288
That doesn't matter. What matters
is Dr. Sloan can do the surgery

363
00:19:56,312 --> 00:19:58,012
right after I operate
on the knee.

364
00:19:58,114 --> 00:20:00,626
That accident might have been the
best thing that ever happened to you.

365
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:03,767
- What's going on?!
- Who are you?

366
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:07,921
You're like some miracle
worker or something.

367
00:20:08,024 --> 00:20:11,909
Thank you. Thank you so much.

368
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:15,379
What the hell is going on?

369
00:20:15,481 --> 00:20:20,668
- Mom, Dr. Sloan can give you...
- Don't you dare sleep with
that woman.

370
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:22,097
- What?
- No?

371
00:20:22,121 --> 00:20:23,304
No.

372
00:20:24,373 --> 00:20:27,007
Dr. Sloan, come
and tell her yourself.

373
00:20:31,364 --> 00:20:36,116
Mrs. Nelson, I'm Dr. Sloan!

374
00:20:36,218 --> 00:20:38,552
I have some very
good news for you!

375
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:42,673
- Shouldn't we put him out?
- Don't put me out.

376
00:20:42,775 --> 00:20:46,576
Hang another unit of FFP.
Maybe... you should consider...

377
00:20:46,678 --> 00:20:49,246
- Eighty over 50.
- There it is. I've got it.

378
00:20:49,882 --> 00:20:51,548
I've got it.

379
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:54,101
OK.

380
00:20:54,203 --> 00:20:55,803
How are you feeling, Dr. Avery?

381
00:20:55,888 --> 00:20:57,854
OK.

382
00:20:57,957 --> 00:21:01,742
- Heart rate's stabilizing.
- Hang in there just
a few more minutes.

383
00:21:01,844 --> 00:21:05,479
- OK? 3-0 silk.
- Silk?

384
00:21:05,581 --> 00:21:07,481
No. Use chromic.

385
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:12,253
- Don't get lazy on me.
- Yep, he's fine.

386
00:21:15,892 --> 00:21:19,777
Right. Chromic instead, Bokie.

387
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:23,697
You paged?

388
00:21:25,485 --> 00:21:27,796
Oh, my God! Are you
doing an ex vivo lung repair?

389
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:31,088
- My daredevil turned
out to be a match.
- You stole his lungs?

390
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:33,006
No, I did not steal them.

391
00:21:33,108 --> 00:21:36,309
The transplant team rejected them and
were gonna send them to medical waste

392
00:21:36,411 --> 00:21:39,579
so I just redirected
them to medical research.

393
00:21:39,681 --> 00:21:42,633
Does Lexipedia want to be
bad-ass and help on this thing or not?

394
00:21:42,735 --> 00:21:45,652
- My God. Yeah!
- OK, so...

395
00:21:45,754 --> 00:21:48,989
I ventilated the lungs
with CO2 and nitrogen...

396
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,561
- Hey.
- Hey.

397
00:21:53,663 --> 00:21:55,507
- Hear about Harper...?
- Your motorcycle...

398
00:21:55,531 --> 00:21:58,131
- You go.
- No, sorry.

399
00:21:58,233 --> 00:22:02,436
I was just gonna say it's kinda
cool, Harper Avery being here.

400
00:22:02,538 --> 00:22:04,438
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

401
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:07,257
- And your motorcycle guy?
- Uh, we lost him.

402
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,060
- But he's a donor.
- That's good.

403
00:22:13,716 --> 00:22:15,466
You should come over
sometime for dinner.

404
00:22:15,568 --> 00:22:21,021
Cristina, she doesn't cook, but if
you remember, I do a mean lasagna.

405
00:22:22,858 --> 00:22:24,169
- Sure.
- Really?

406
00:22:24,193 --> 00:22:27,828
- Yeah. Sounds fun.
- OK.

407
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:32,616
- Uh, I gotta go.
- All right.

408
00:22:32,718 --> 00:22:36,753
- Talk to you later.
- OK, I know you love Yang.

409
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:41,592
She gives you the warm and fuzzies
with her magical, special heart skills.

410
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:45,040
But those lungs you're transplanting
belonged to a patient of mine,

411
00:22:45,064 --> 00:22:47,559
and it'd mean a lot to turn his
death into something meaningful.

412
00:22:47,583 --> 00:22:50,250
I'm sorry. What lungs?

413
00:22:50,352 --> 00:22:52,214
You went behind my
back. You used my name.

414
00:22:52,238 --> 00:22:54,972
We followed the protocol,
didn't tell the patient.

415
00:22:55,074 --> 00:22:56,807
You stole lungs!

416
00:22:56,909 --> 00:22:59,543
Which they were about to
throw out. She was being green.

417
00:22:59,645 --> 00:23:02,996
Great! Then I don't have to worry
about the thousands of dollars you spent,

418
00:23:03,098 --> 00:23:07,150
and the fact that no one in this
hospital has ever tried this before.

419
00:23:07,252 --> 00:23:12,756
Oh, my God. This is
about Harper Avery, isn't it?

420
00:23:12,858 --> 00:23:15,893
- That's why you did this?
- Why is that such a bad thing?

421
00:23:15,994 --> 00:23:21,131
- The point is that we... You can pull this surgery off.
- Oh, wow, thank you.

422
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:24,112
Who needs Harper Avery when they've
got the Cristina Yang seal of approval?

423
00:23:24,136 --> 00:23:26,704
- That's not what I was saying.
- All this ambition of yours,

424
00:23:26,806 --> 00:23:29,206
this desperate
need to win prizes,

425
00:23:29,308 --> 00:23:31,642
- it means
your priorities are off!
- Hey.

426
00:23:31,727 --> 00:23:34,261
- Prizes push us to be better.
- They push us to be monsters!

427
00:23:34,363 --> 00:23:35,846
- Hey.
- Is the status quo not trying?

428
00:23:35,948 --> 00:23:37,848
- That's worse!
- Hey!

429
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:41,518
The lungs, look!
They're... They're viable.

430
00:23:51,196 --> 00:23:55,048
A transplant with repaired lungs has
never been done in the United States.

431
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:59,486
The risks are tremendous, and with the
amount of radiation that you sustained,

432
00:23:59,588 --> 00:24:02,406
there's no way of knowing
how friable your tissue is

433
00:24:02,508 --> 00:24:04,491
or if you can even
sustain a transplant.

434
00:24:04,594 --> 00:24:07,127
Wait, I'm sorry. Are you saying
you recommend it though?

435
00:24:07,229 --> 00:24:10,330
No, they're saying they want to
give us a pair of hand-me-down lungs.

436
00:24:10,432 --> 00:24:13,701
- The ones no one else wants.
- These are good lungs.

437
00:24:13,803 --> 00:24:15,635
This procedure has
allowed us to repair them

438
00:24:15,738 --> 00:24:19,590
- so they're
virtually the same...
- No. We'll wait.

439
00:24:19,692 --> 00:24:24,061
We'll wait until you get
the lungs you deserve.

440
00:24:25,331 --> 00:24:28,799
You're so used to fighting,
you don't even realize.

441
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:31,735
This is it.

442
00:24:31,837 --> 00:24:37,157
I'm sick and I'm
tired and I'm ready.

443
00:24:38,261 --> 00:24:40,405
No matter what happens,
my affairs are in order.

444
00:24:40,429 --> 00:24:43,763
Your affairs are not in
order. Don't you dare say that.

445
00:24:43,865 --> 00:24:49,303
Dr. Robbins, please.
Is this my best shot?

446
00:24:51,707 --> 00:24:56,159
I'm not your surgeon here,
Elliot. I have to defer to Dr. Altman.

447
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,466
It's your only shot.

448
00:25:20,469 --> 00:25:22,569
Then, yes. Do it.

449
00:25:23,973 --> 00:25:25,756
Give me the hand-me-downs.

450
00:25:40,005 --> 00:25:42,522
Dr. Sloan, good timing.
Dr. Karev and I are done.

451
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:44,870
- What the hell
are you looking at?
- Nothing.

452
00:25:44,894 --> 00:25:49,062
- Get out of my OR, Karev!
- Mark, you're way out
of line here.

453
00:25:50,165 --> 00:25:51,965
It's fine, I'll go.

454
00:25:52,067 --> 00:25:54,551
He's got serial-killer eyes.
I'm almost done here anyway.

455
00:25:54,653 --> 00:25:57,387
- You're sure?
- Yeah.

456
00:26:00,109 --> 00:26:02,859
- That is enough!
- It's funny. Did you see his face?

457
00:26:02,961 --> 00:26:06,246
It is sad and pathetic. And
you have a choice here.

458
00:26:06,349 --> 00:26:09,549
Sloan and her baby leaving you
can either be the worst or best thing

459
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:13,020
that happened to you. You can grow
up, find a woman to love and have a baby,

460
00:26:13,122 --> 00:26:15,906
or you can be the ass
attending who abuses residents

461
00:26:16,008 --> 00:26:18,958
and screws whatever
walks into this hospital.

462
00:26:19,061 --> 00:26:20,727
So just pick one.

463
00:26:23,048 --> 00:26:24,648
Drape the ear, please.

464
00:26:26,986 --> 00:26:28,218
Look, it's not gonna happen.

465
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,570
Five minutes with your
grandpappy, that's all I ask.

466
00:26:30,673 --> 00:26:32,789
Right, because the two of
us are such good friends.

467
00:26:32,891 --> 00:26:35,370
- This would go
a long way to help that.
- Back off, Karev.

468
00:26:35,394 --> 00:26:38,056
- If anybody's
a friend here, it's me.
- You're not meeting him either.

469
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:42,198
- What happened to
"Mercy West forever?"
- That was never a thing.

470
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,067
Now, leave.

471
00:26:52,528 --> 00:26:54,127
I hate it.

472
00:26:54,229 --> 00:26:56,897
I hate it when they
know I'm related to him.

473
00:26:56,999 --> 00:27:01,101
The way they treat me, the way
they watch me as soon as they find out.

474
00:27:01,203 --> 00:27:06,240
I know the name has
helped, but he is not easy.

475
00:27:06,342 --> 00:27:11,528
Brilliant, but really not
easy to be related to.

476
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:17,434
It's him. 911.

477
00:27:18,337 --> 00:27:20,404
What is it? You paged?

478
00:27:21,022 --> 00:27:22,389
You're OK?

479
00:27:22,491 --> 00:27:25,426
We never got a chance to
finish our talk from this morning.

480
00:27:25,528 --> 00:27:28,145
- Our talk? Are you kidding me?
- You brought Dr. Grey.

481
00:27:28,247 --> 00:27:32,582
That's good, actually.
Answer me this time, Dr. Grey.

482
00:27:32,684 --> 00:27:34,617
If a spot was being held for you

483
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:38,405
to study at the greatest hospital in
this country, would you turn it down?

484
00:27:38,507 --> 00:27:43,043
- A spot? Well...
- Yeah, he saved a spot for me

485
00:27:43,145 --> 00:27:45,140
at Mass Gen ever
since I graduated.

486
00:27:45,164 --> 00:27:48,176
The only reason he came to visit,
to try to convince me to take it. Again.

487
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,868
- It's an incredible
opportunity.
- An opportunity I don't want!

488
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:53,770
I don't want to work for you. I
don't want your help. I don't...

489
00:27:53,873 --> 00:27:55,605
- It's enough...
- No!

490
00:27:55,707 --> 00:27:57,824
I decide when I've said enough!

491
00:27:57,926 --> 00:28:01,545
You think I am arrogant
and overbearing,

492
00:28:01,647 --> 00:28:03,963
and you've made
that clear. Maybe I am.

493
00:28:04,065 --> 00:28:07,267
But I am also your
only living grandfather,

494
00:28:07,369 --> 00:28:11,338
and it has become very clear to
me today that my time is coming.

495
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,341
I... I can't leave...

496
00:28:14,443 --> 00:28:16,426
Grandpa? Grandpa?

497
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:19,712
- V-tach!
- No pulse! No pulse. Get a crash cart in here!

498
00:28:22,734 --> 00:28:25,102
Your CT shows that
there's been a complication.

499
00:28:25,204 --> 00:28:28,671
Dr. Webber will take you back
into the OR and fix it right away.

500
00:28:28,774 --> 00:28:33,209
Fine... But you're
not putting me out.

501
00:28:33,311 --> 00:28:36,646
Clearly, a mistake was made.
I'm not letting that happen again.

502
00:28:36,749 --> 00:28:40,099
That's not gonna happen this
time. You're in my hospital today.

503
00:28:40,202 --> 00:28:42,118
You will abide by my rules.

504
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:45,289
That means you go under general.
Your grandson will be in the waiting room

505
00:28:45,391 --> 00:28:50,344
as family. If you refuse, then
I'll personally declare you unfit

506
00:28:50,446 --> 00:28:53,196
to make decisions
regarding your own care.

507
00:28:55,166 --> 00:28:58,301
That is how a chief
does things. Take note.

508
00:29:01,756 --> 00:29:04,808
- Have Bailey do the surgery.
- Richard.

509
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:07,210
It could've been my
mistake in there, Derek.

510
00:29:07,312 --> 00:29:12,415
Do you understand what this would
mean, making an error on this man?

511
00:29:13,986 --> 00:29:19,188
I want a drink. Not operate, not
hold another man's life in my hands.

512
00:29:19,291 --> 00:29:22,960
So, please, let Bailey do it.

513
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:26,213
Bailey will assist.

514
00:29:27,549 --> 00:29:30,250
Two months ago, you never
would've told me you wanted a drink.

515
00:29:30,352 --> 00:29:35,088
You would've had one.
You can do this, Richard.

516
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:42,829
I get it.

517
00:29:42,931 --> 00:29:47,084
You got used to being the
one person she could count on.

518
00:29:47,185 --> 00:29:52,188
Now, suddenly, you're
supposed to just move on.

519
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:55,242
Get a life that doesn't involve
taking care of the one person

520
00:29:55,344 --> 00:29:58,595
you thought needed
you. That's hard.

521
00:29:58,697 --> 00:30:03,066
OK. Yeah.

522
00:30:03,168 --> 00:30:06,570
Except no. I am not gonna
miss taking care of her.

523
00:30:06,672 --> 00:30:09,339
I wasted years of my life.

524
00:30:09,441 --> 00:30:13,092
And I was miserable. But now...

525
00:30:14,596 --> 00:30:17,264
I can do anything.

526
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:22,018
Right? I mean, I
can... I can move out.

527
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,021
Get my own place.

528
00:30:25,374 --> 00:30:27,474
Have men over.

529
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:30,994
Men that look like you.

530
00:30:32,731 --> 00:30:35,932
I was taking care of
you, you little tramp.

531
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:38,468
Mom?

532
00:30:40,138 --> 00:30:41,822
No one asked you to move in.

533
00:30:43,325 --> 00:30:48,395
You were getting a divorce and you
had no place to go, so you came home.

534
00:30:48,496 --> 00:30:52,832
I didn't need you to take
care of me. I was fine. Happy.

535
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:57,904
But I let you because I
was taking care of you.

536
00:30:58,007 --> 00:31:00,473
You heard all that?

537
00:31:01,443 --> 00:31:04,978
Mom, you can hear!

538
00:31:05,531 --> 00:31:07,831
- I can?
- Yeah!

539
00:31:07,933 --> 00:31:10,834
Oh, my God, I can! I can!

540
00:31:10,936 --> 00:31:14,337
- Say something! Say something else!
- OK!

541
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:18,325
- I'm moving out, Mom.
- I heard that.

542
00:31:19,211 --> 00:31:20,538
- Whoo!
- Shh!

543
00:31:20,562 --> 00:31:22,162
Sorry.

544
00:31:28,587 --> 00:31:30,265
- Damn it.
- What is it?

545
00:31:30,289 --> 00:31:33,690
The tissue is falling apart,
the clamp's not holding.

546
00:31:35,494 --> 00:31:38,044
Get me some umbilical tape.

547
00:31:39,381 --> 00:31:41,548
This is why I hate awards.

548
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:44,584
They don't make us better,
just more competitive and stupid.

549
00:31:44,686 --> 00:31:47,837
And for what? To put on a
dress, and eat a bad piece of fish

550
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:50,940
and take home an ugly paperweight
that's gonna sit on your mantle

551
00:31:51,009 --> 00:31:54,444
for the rest of your sad,
empty, misguided life.

552
00:31:54,546 --> 00:31:57,480
- Do an interposition
vein graft.
- What?

553
00:31:57,582 --> 00:32:00,867
- You have something to add,
Dr. Yang?
- No, just...

554
00:32:03,038 --> 00:32:06,506
You've already gotten this far,
you could repair the PA with a graft.

555
00:32:06,608 --> 00:32:10,860
- Maybe.
- No.

556
00:32:13,365 --> 00:32:16,883
I could do a pericardial patch. I could
use his pericardium to do the repair.

557
00:32:16,985 --> 00:32:18,318
Start cooling him.

558
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:20,198
Arrest the heart. How are
we doing on time, Grey?

559
00:32:20,222 --> 00:32:22,872
Cold ischemic time
three hours so far.

560
00:32:22,957 --> 00:32:26,626
Which means we still have enough
time to save the lungs if we hurry.

561
00:32:26,728 --> 00:32:28,961
All right, Yang, get in
there and help me. Clamp.

562
00:32:29,064 --> 00:32:30,763
Good. Here we go.

563
00:32:48,534 --> 00:32:54,070
His bowels are all swollen and
hardened, the anastomosis is leaking.

564
00:32:54,172 --> 00:32:56,256
Which explains why
he went into shock.

565
00:32:56,358 --> 00:32:58,758
All in all, I'd say this
is about the best news

566
00:32:58,877 --> 00:33:02,078
- we could've asked for,
Dr. Webber.
- I don't understand.

567
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:04,964
His bowels are perforated.
He's leaking intestinal contents.

568
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:08,468
Because Dr. Avery was
allergic to the chromic suture.

569
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:12,488
He didn't know because he was always
wearing gloves in his own surgeries.

570
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:14,990
And you couldn't
have known either.

571
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:18,311
Which is why I am
smiling behind this mask.

572
00:33:20,565 --> 00:33:23,166
Get the 3-0 silk ready, Bokie.

573
00:33:30,358 --> 00:33:32,959
OK. This is it.

574
00:33:33,061 --> 00:33:36,796
Let's take him off bypass and see
if these lungs can work on their own.

575
00:33:37,615 --> 00:33:38,881
Clamping.

576
00:33:40,552 --> 00:33:41,634
There.

577
00:33:49,394 --> 00:33:51,244
Come on. Breathe.

578
00:33:54,132 --> 00:33:58,184
Breathe. Breathe, damn it.

579
00:34:15,253 --> 00:34:17,971
I just spent the past
five hours trying to be

580
00:34:18,073 --> 00:34:22,608
OK with the fact that my
only brother was dead, and...

581
00:34:24,112 --> 00:34:27,263
You're saying it worked?
He's gonna be OK?

582
00:34:27,365 --> 00:34:30,766
- Barring any complications...
- He's gonna be OK, yes.

583
00:34:33,004 --> 00:34:36,005
- Would you like to see him?
- Yeah.

584
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:39,992
OK, come on.

585
00:34:45,933 --> 00:34:50,236
Hey. So he's fine. It was an
allergy caused by the suture.

586
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:54,474
It was his fault then. Wow.

587
00:34:54,576 --> 00:34:59,095
That's awesome. Why
don't they publish that story?

588
00:34:59,197 --> 00:35:02,165
Yeah, I know. I get it.
The famous grandfather.

589
00:35:02,267 --> 00:35:05,552
The legacy he's trying force on
you. You didn't ask for any of it.

590
00:35:05,654 --> 00:35:08,054
Trust me, I get it.
You're putting up walls

591
00:35:08,123 --> 00:35:11,391
and avoiding him and you don't
want to introduce him to your friends.

592
00:35:11,493 --> 00:35:15,044
It was the same with my mother.
But if she were here right now,

593
00:35:15,147 --> 00:35:19,332
in a room upstairs, I'd want to go
see her and make things right with her.

594
00:35:19,434 --> 00:35:23,436
And I definitely would
want to go learn from her.

595
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:25,304
And you still can.

596
00:35:36,568 --> 00:35:40,886
Guess who just helped save a guy's
life by suggesting a highly experimental,

597
00:35:40,988 --> 00:35:43,956
- awesome procedure...
- Did you tell Sloan
we were together?

598
00:35:44,059 --> 00:35:47,360
- What?
- Look, I like you.

599
00:35:47,462 --> 00:35:50,480
You're a great time in bed. But
don't go telling your ex we're together

600
00:35:50,582 --> 00:35:52,948
so you can make him jealous.

601
00:35:53,051 --> 00:35:55,396
I did not tell Mark
that we were together.

602
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:58,221
- I am not trying
to make him jealous.
- Yeah, right.

603
00:35:58,323 --> 00:36:00,157
I'm getting kicked out
of ORs for a reason.

604
00:36:00,259 --> 00:36:04,927
For once in my life, for once, I am
doing something that is only for me.

605
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:07,964
And it has nothing to do with
me having feelings for you.

606
00:36:08,066 --> 00:36:10,734
Or for Mark. Or anyone, really.

607
00:36:10,836 --> 00:36:14,988
This is about not feeling.
You make me not feel.

608
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:18,091
If you can't handle that, if you
can't handle being used for sex,

609
00:36:18,193 --> 00:36:22,228
then please just tell me so
that I can find a guy who can.

610
00:36:24,232 --> 00:36:26,282
I'm all about not feeling.

611
00:36:28,787 --> 00:36:32,022
- You've been through
a lot, I...
- Don't get all mushy on me.

612
00:36:32,123 --> 00:36:36,692
I'm just saying we're on the same
page. And I got a free 20 minutes.

613
00:36:36,794 --> 00:36:39,162
You wanna go not have
feelings somewhere?

614
00:36:50,592 --> 00:36:53,459
Excuse me, Dr...

615
00:36:53,561 --> 00:36:57,797
It's really bad form to cancel plans
with new friends. You know that, right?

616
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,085
I'll meet you in 15.

617
00:37:03,187 --> 00:37:04,667
- Hey.
- Hi.

618
00:37:05,239 --> 00:37:06,719
- Hi.
- Hey.

619
00:37:06,775 --> 00:37:11,410
So... I heard about
the lung transplant.

620
00:37:13,432 --> 00:37:18,134
- Cristina said that
you were amazing.
- No, Cristina was amazing.

621
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:23,439
You tell her I said
that and you're dead.

622
00:37:27,228 --> 00:37:31,648
You wanna grab a beer,
celebrate? I was gonna head to Joe's.

623
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:35,852
I've got plans,
actually. Ladies night.

624
00:37:35,954 --> 00:37:37,620
I'm a little scared.

625
00:37:40,308 --> 00:37:41,908
I'll see you tomorrow, Hunt.

626
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:46,429
<i>No matter how many plans
we make or steps we follow...</i>

627
00:37:46,531 --> 00:37:47,797
See you tomorrow.

628
00:37:47,899 --> 00:37:50,983
<i>We never know how
our day is going to end up.</i>

629
00:37:51,086 --> 00:37:54,687
<i>We'd prefer to know, of course,
what curveballs will be thrown our way.</i>

630
00:37:54,789 --> 00:37:57,606
Karev!

631
00:37:57,708 --> 00:37:59,475
Look, dude, she's
not my girlfriend.

632
00:37:59,577 --> 00:38:01,243
Whatever business
you have to work out...

633
00:38:01,346 --> 00:38:05,565
I'll stop. The yelling, throwing
you out of ORs, it's over.

634
00:38:07,152 --> 00:38:10,904
Hey.

635
00:38:13,775 --> 00:38:15,074
Hey.

636
00:38:34,012 --> 00:38:36,290
<i>It's the accidents that
always turn out to be</i>

637
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:38,831
<i>the most interesting
parts of our day.</i>

638
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:41,734
<i>Of life.</i>

639
00:38:41,836 --> 00:38:45,971
How's your regenerative
medicine research going?

640
00:38:46,073 --> 00:38:50,476
Uh... I put it on the
shelf a few years back.

641
00:38:51,312 --> 00:38:53,312
Got preoccupied.

642
00:38:53,681 --> 00:38:56,115
Huh.

643
00:38:56,217 --> 00:39:01,921
That research put you on the shortlist
for my award several times, Webber.

644
00:39:03,024 --> 00:39:05,391
Maybe it's time to dust it off.

645
00:39:07,412 --> 00:39:08,761
Maybe it is.

646
00:39:10,114 --> 00:39:12,882
<i>The people we never
expected to show up.</i>

647
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:18,071
- Grandpa, I...
- Ah.

648
00:39:18,173 --> 00:39:20,940
Wanted to introduce
you to some friends.

649
00:39:21,042 --> 00:39:22,219
If you feel up for it.

650
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:26,462
Bring 'em in.

651
00:39:28,666 --> 00:39:30,799
All right. Hurry up. Come on.

652
00:39:30,902 --> 00:39:34,437
We met... already
this morning, I know.

653
00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:36,584
But you weren't...

654
00:39:36,608 --> 00:39:38,641
There was so much going on.

655
00:39:38,743 --> 00:39:41,377
Start with your name,
and we'll go from there.

656
00:39:41,479 --> 00:39:44,480
- Cristina Yang. It's an honor, sir.
- It's nice to...

657
00:39:44,565 --> 00:39:46,966
- Thank you so much.
- Officially meet you.

658
00:39:47,068 --> 00:39:48,868
- And the rest of you.
- Lexie Grey.

659
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:51,890
<i>The turn of events we never
would've chosen for ourselves.</i>

660
00:39:51,923 --> 00:39:53,484
- You won't make that.
- I'll make it.

661
00:39:53,508 --> 00:39:57,560
I told off one of my heroes
today, I can do anything.

662
00:39:57,662 --> 00:40:01,381
You know Teddy did an ex vivo lung
repair today? It was pretty incredible.

663
00:40:03,769 --> 00:40:06,168
I slept with my patient's
daughter, just now.

664
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:09,955
After restoring her mother's
hearing. Don't worry, Derek.

665
00:40:10,058 --> 00:40:12,708
I promise never to do it again.

666
00:40:13,528 --> 00:40:15,027
Wow. We suck.

667
00:40:16,848 --> 00:40:18,832
- They were just leaving.
- We were?

668
00:40:18,934 --> 00:40:22,601
- Yeah.
- Right, we were.

669
00:40:23,638 --> 00:40:27,006
- Good night, Webber.
- Good night.

670
00:40:32,063 --> 00:40:34,113
I had to pee in a
cup today, Derek.

671
00:40:34,916 --> 00:40:36,549
I had to pee in a cup.

672
00:40:36,651 --> 00:40:39,402
And it was humiliating.

673
00:40:39,504 --> 00:40:43,355
And, what I did today,
agreeing to the awake surgery,

674
00:40:43,457 --> 00:40:46,025
I know I overstepped, but...

675
00:40:47,328 --> 00:40:50,329
I needed to feel something
other than humiliated.

676
00:40:50,431 --> 00:40:52,431
I understand.

677
00:40:53,234 --> 00:40:55,250
Tomorrow's another day.

678
00:40:57,055 --> 00:40:58,587
Thank you.

679
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:01,224
<i>All of a sudden, you
find yourself somewhere</i>

680
00:41:01,326 --> 00:41:03,392
<i>you never expected to be.</i>

681
00:41:03,477 --> 00:41:05,227
<i>And it's nice.</i>

682
00:41:07,665 --> 00:41:09,766
<i>Or it takes some
getting used to.</i>

683
00:41:09,868 --> 00:41:12,034
Why couldn't we have
gone dancing for girls night?

684
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:15,538
- Or bowling?
- We took a vote.

685
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:18,775
You lost. Besides, it's fun.

686
00:41:18,877 --> 00:41:22,195
- Says who?
- Bailey's face. Look at it.

687
00:41:22,297 --> 00:41:24,914
Go, go, go! Come
on, come on, come on!

688
00:41:26,184 --> 00:41:28,151
That's right!

689
00:41:28,253 --> 00:41:31,470
<i>Still, you know you'll find
yourself appreciating it</i>

690
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:33,256
<i>somewhere down the line.</i>

691
00:41:33,358 --> 00:41:35,725
I'm in love with
Teddy. I love her.

692
00:41:35,827 --> 00:41:39,528
You're like Lexie with the inappropriate
feelings for inappropriate people.

693
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:43,066
What can I say? My
heart lives in my scalpel.

694
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:46,702
- Those were trick balls.
- - Bailey, you gotta be taller!

695
00:41:46,804 --> 00:41:48,215
- I got it.
- Let 'em go.

696
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:50,523
<i>So you go to sleep each
night thinking about tomorrow.</i>

697
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:54,594
- That's what I'm talking about!
- Yes!

698
00:41:54,695 --> 00:41:58,280
- Beat that, Yang!
- Oh, no, it's Teddy's turn.

699
00:41:58,382 --> 00:42:01,117
<i>- Going over your plans...</i>
<i>- </i> Gonna feel great
when you connect.

700
00:42:01,202 --> 00:42:03,920
<i>- preparing the lists...</i>
- Like making your first
incision.

701
00:42:04,022 --> 00:42:06,722
Take it. Just you,
the bat and the ball.

702
00:42:06,824 --> 00:42:09,926
Yeah, I'm a badass chick,
Cristina. I've swung a bat before.

703
00:42:10,028 --> 00:42:11,706
OK, let's see it.

704
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:14,530
<i>And hoping that whatever
accidents come your way...</i>

705
00:42:17,968 --> 00:42:21,437
<i>will be happy ones.</i>
