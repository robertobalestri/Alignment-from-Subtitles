00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:12,077
<i>For most people, a
hospital is a scary place.</i>

2
00:00:13,714 --> 00:00:15,247
<i>A hostile place.</i>

3
00:00:17,718 --> 00:00:19,451
Sorry.

4
00:00:19,553 --> 00:00:21,219
It's mine.

5
00:00:28,929 --> 00:00:31,897
<i>A place where bad things happen.</i>

6
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:46,578
You can't pay with that.

7
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:50,498
Oh, it's, uh... it's my AA chip.

8
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,636
- Six months sober.
- Good for you.

9
00:00:54,738 --> 00:00:58,390
<i>Most people would
prefer church. Or school.</i>

10
00:00:58,492 --> 00:01:00,292
<i>Or home.</i>

11
00:01:09,169 --> 00:01:12,186
Damn it, will you stop crying?

12
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:16,108
You stop crying.

13
00:01:22,683 --> 00:01:25,500
<i>But I grew up here.</i>

14
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:31,340
<i>While my mom was on rounds,</i>

15
00:01:31,442 --> 00:01:33,908
<i>I learned to read
in the OR gallery.</i>

16
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,977
<i>I played in the morgue.</i>

17
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,714
<i>I colored with crayons
on old ER charts.</i>

18
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:41,950
<i>A hospital was my church.</i>

19
00:01:44,388 --> 00:01:45,887
<i>My school.</i>

20
00:01:46,973 --> 00:01:49,257
<i>My home.</i>

21
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:52,393
<i>A hospital was my safe place.</i>

22
00:01:52,495 --> 00:01:53,912
<i>My sanctuary.</i>

23
00:01:55,482 --> 00:01:58,117
<i>I love it here.</i>

24
00:02:09,213 --> 00:02:13,849
<i>Correction: loved it here.</i>

25
00:02:17,354 --> 00:02:19,070
- No way.
- Yeah.

26
00:02:19,172 --> 00:02:21,973
- No freaking way!
- Right?

27
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:24,626
Oh, my God. OK, um...

28
00:02:24,728 --> 00:02:26,995
- Were you trying to...
- No! Total accident.

29
00:02:27,097 --> 00:02:30,649
- I used the thing.
- Oh. So are we
happy about this?

30
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,936
Or are we exercising
our legal right to choose?

31
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,872
OK! All right!

32
00:02:37,974 --> 00:02:40,842
- Congratulations! Let's hug it out.
- OK.

33
00:02:40,944 --> 00:02:44,412
- My God... Have you told him?
- No, I just found out.

34
00:02:45,799 --> 00:02:46,993
- Teddy.
- Derek.

35
00:02:47,017 --> 00:02:48,667
- You gonna tell him now?
- Yeah.

36
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:51,089
- OK.
- How's the Teddy
and Owen thing going?

37
00:02:51,187 --> 00:02:55,223
Oh, fantastic. It's going
great. I'm completely over it.

38
00:02:58,145 --> 00:02:59,377
This is very adult.

39
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:01,090
I'm really proud of
you, Meredith Grey.

40
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:04,232
- I'm... proud of me, too?
- Yes, yes.

41
00:03:04,335 --> 00:03:05,900
OK.

42
00:03:06,003 --> 00:03:08,720
- Hey, I hope it has his hair.
- Me, too!

43
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:19,131
You know where I can find
the chief of surgery? Excuse me.

44
00:03:19,233 --> 00:03:21,433
- Chief of surgery?
- No idea. Sorry.

45
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:23,468
Go ask a nurse if
you can find him.

46
00:03:24,638 --> 00:03:26,671
- You paged?
- She's in a lot of pain.

47
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:28,973
- OK.
- Ruby Kendall. Age nine.

48
00:03:29,076 --> 00:03:31,021
Fever, tenderness
over McBurney's point.

49
00:03:31,045 --> 00:03:33,278
All right, appendix.
Let me check your belly.

50
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,457
Ow!

51
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:37,965
Oh... Yeah, you have
a very angry appendix.

52
00:03:38,067 --> 00:03:40,129
That's surgery?
She needs surgery?

53
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:43,049
Yes, she does. But the good news
is, it's the easiest surgery in the world.

54
00:03:43,073 --> 00:03:45,724
I mean, she's a baby
surgeon and she could do it.

55
00:03:45,826 --> 00:03:47,003
You're gonna let me do it?

56
00:03:47,027 --> 00:03:48,971
You're going to let
her do the surgery?

57
00:03:48,995 --> 00:03:51,630
No, of course not. I'm gonna
do it. I'm kind of fabulous at it.

58
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:54,516
Ruby, you are gonna be
out of here by tomorrow

59
00:03:54,618 --> 00:03:56,067
with a teeny, tiny little scar,

60
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:58,753
and a good excuse to have
your parents feed you ice cream

61
00:03:58,855 --> 00:04:00,155
every night of the week.

62
00:04:00,257 --> 00:04:02,707
Dr. Grey, admit her to peds
and make sure she's comfortable

63
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:04,142
while we get an OR.

64
00:04:05,312 --> 00:04:07,479
- What?
- Jason Perkins, six-year-old

65
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:09,331
with a comminuted
tibia fracture.

66
00:04:09,432 --> 00:04:12,684
You could be nicer. He peed his pants
and I cleaned it up before you got here.

67
00:04:12,786 --> 00:04:14,936
Sorry. Good man, Alex. Thanks.

68
00:04:15,038 --> 00:04:16,605
Hi.

69
00:04:23,264 --> 00:04:25,530
You got paged, too?

70
00:04:25,633 --> 00:04:28,911
Come on, Teddy. Cristina's not
talking to me, you're not talking to me.

71
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:31,035
- Come on.
- I don't want to talk about it.

72
00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:34,573
I don't want to go over again how
you told Derek to give my job away.

73
00:04:34,675 --> 00:04:38,910
I don't want to discuss it, or hear you
apologize or forgive you, or anything.

74
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:40,812
You know what I want?
A little bit of peace.

75
00:04:40,914 --> 00:04:44,066
- What do you got?
- 18-gauge. Get ready to move.

76
00:04:47,154 --> 00:04:50,505
- Shut up.
- I'm sorry. I'm truly sorry.

77
00:04:50,607 --> 00:04:52,674
- Honey, are you hearing this?
- I told you.

78
00:04:52,776 --> 00:04:56,027
- You know, I told her, Dr. B.
- That doesn't mean I like it.

79
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,546
I really can't have my
second surgery today?

80
00:04:58,648 --> 00:04:59,888
Dr. Percy.

81
00:04:59,917 --> 00:05:02,400
Your hemoglobin and
hematocrit are extremely low.

82
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:05,470
Your tank is empty. You need a
blood transfusion before we can operate.

83
00:05:05,572 --> 00:05:07,688
- Shut up.
- Yes, ma'am.

84
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:10,391
Do you know how long I've
been living with a colostomy bag?

85
00:05:10,493 --> 00:05:12,839
A bag of my poop
is attached to me.

86
00:05:12,863 --> 00:05:14,103
Do you know what that's like?

87
00:05:14,131 --> 00:05:15,530
It's gross.

88
00:05:15,632 --> 00:05:19,050
It's truly the grossest thing
I've ever had to deal with.

89
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:25,006
And I'm starving, because I can't eat
solid food for 24 hours before surgery.

90
00:05:25,108 --> 00:05:27,319
Starving. I would
eat you if I could.

91
00:05:27,343 --> 00:05:29,272
Yeah, on the plus side, that
means no poop in the bag.

92
00:05:29,296 --> 00:05:32,163
- Bill!
- OK, we're gonna
get blood in you

93
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:35,167
and Dr. Percy is gonna
monitor your blood levels.

94
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:40,789
And tomorrow, we'll see if
we can help lose the poop bag.

95
00:05:40,891 --> 00:05:43,291
Let's get you some food
so you don't eat Dr. Percy.

96
00:05:43,393 --> 00:05:46,594
- I don't like him
but he's useful.
- Can I have real food?

97
00:05:46,696 --> 00:05:49,614
Like pizza? From that one
place near that one spot?

98
00:05:49,717 --> 00:05:52,984
With pepperoni and
sausage and ham?

99
00:05:53,087 --> 00:05:58,923
If you get the pizza, you also get the
bowel prep and enema that comes with it.

100
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:02,026
Totally worth the
pizza. Bring it on.

101
00:06:02,128 --> 00:06:03,311
Back in 15 minutes.

102
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:11,753
- How hot is my husband's ass?
- It's very hot, ma'am.

103
00:06:15,826 --> 00:06:17,342
He's dead, isn't he?

104
00:06:17,444 --> 00:06:19,327
- Is he dead?
- He's not dead, ma'am.

105
00:06:19,429 --> 00:06:21,589
You can't go in there.
The doctors are working.

106
00:06:21,648 --> 00:06:24,332
He has a serious gunshot
wound. They need to concentrate.

107
00:06:24,434 --> 00:06:26,229
They said he was
in a car accident.

108
00:06:26,253 --> 00:06:28,280
He was shot? Someone shot him?

109
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:30,555
- I don't...
- Oh!

110
00:06:30,657 --> 00:06:32,740
Pete! Oh, my God, Pete!

111
00:06:32,842 --> 00:06:36,628
- Please, wait... Pete? Pete?
- Extend your incision.

112
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,848
- This guy hit me.
- Good.

113
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:42,017
I stopped the car to give
him my insurance card.

114
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:45,570
- Stats are still dropping.
- I get out and he shoots me.

115
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:48,500
I'm in. Chest tube.

116
00:06:48,524 --> 00:06:49,757
Pete... Pete?!

117
00:06:49,859 --> 00:06:51,187
- Bag him.
- Pete!

118
00:06:51,211 --> 00:06:52,961
There's blood in the
chest. Clamp that!

119
00:06:53,063 --> 00:06:55,480
Call the OR, tell
'em we're on our way.

120
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:57,977
- Get him ready for transport.
- - They're taking him to surgery.

121
00:06:58,001 --> 00:07:01,903
- Please, he's my husband!
- Let her say goodbye.

122
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:04,372
Owen, there's no time.

123
00:07:04,474 --> 00:07:07,641
Goodbye, baby. I love
you. I love you, OK?

124
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:10,761
Don't die, 'cause I love you!
Oh, God! What's happening?

125
00:07:10,863 --> 00:07:12,981
- Out of here, now!
- Chest tube secure!

126
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:14,977
- There wasn't time to waste.
- There was time.

127
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:18,186
That might be the last time she sees
the man she loves. There was time.

128
00:07:18,288 --> 00:07:20,304
You paged? You
heading to the OR?

129
00:07:20,406 --> 00:07:22,486
Yeah, but I need you to
cover my post ops, I'm sorry.

130
00:07:22,558 --> 00:07:24,275
- I'm not going into surgery?
- Cristina.

131
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:25,977
I'm talking to Dr. Altman.

132
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,532
- I need you
to cover my post ops.
- OK, fine. No problem.

133
00:07:30,634 --> 00:07:31,999
Let's go.

134
00:07:32,101 --> 00:07:33,785
- MRI?
- Yeah.

135
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,904
We're running!

136
00:07:37,257 --> 00:07:38,573
Watch out! Coming through.

137
00:07:38,675 --> 00:07:39,991
Clear that line!

138
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:45,680
Excuse me, I was asking if someone
could tell me where I can find the chief.

139
00:07:45,782 --> 00:07:48,449
I'm sorry, sir. If you could
just give me a minute, OK?

140
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:54,789
Coming through!

141
00:07:56,292 --> 00:07:59,372
- The lead was loose.
- I'll
let him know. Hold on.

142
00:08:03,584 --> 00:08:05,984
- Excuse me, ma'am?
- It's "doctor," what?

143
00:08:06,085 --> 00:08:09,337
I was wondering if you could tell me
where I can find Dr. Derek Shepherd?

144
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:11,723
Um... You know, I don't know.

145
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:14,392
Can you tell me where his
office is? I'm kind of turned around.

146
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:17,812
Sir, I have a patient having seizures
in there. Find a nurse and ask them.

147
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:21,232
- Ma'am...
- You're not supposed
to be back here.

148
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:24,419
I'm not a tour guide.
I'm a surgeon, OK?

149
00:08:29,325 --> 00:08:32,660
Dude, what the...?

150
00:09:15,122 --> 00:09:16,755
Hey! You paged?

151
00:09:16,857 --> 00:09:19,724
I like to say hello to
my wife every 48 hours.

152
00:09:19,826 --> 00:09:21,559
You didn't come home last night.

153
00:09:21,661 --> 00:09:23,861
I told you, every Tuesday
night, I'm trolling for cases.

154
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:25,796
Last night, a guy
crashed his motorcycle,

155
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:27,560
had rebar jammed
in the base of his skull

156
00:09:27,584 --> 00:09:29,429
and Shadow Shepherd
let me do the extraction.

157
00:09:29,453 --> 00:09:31,736
You know what I've
been doing? Paperwork.

158
00:09:31,838 --> 00:09:35,073
Know what I have to look
forward to today? More paperwork.

159
00:09:35,175 --> 00:09:38,043
This job is just... I would love to
have something jammed in my brain.

160
00:09:38,145 --> 00:09:40,161
That way I'd see
the inside of an OR.

161
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:45,100
OK, well... Are you gonna
come home early tonight?

162
00:09:45,202 --> 00:09:47,968
Because we can order in and
I have some stuff to tell you.

163
00:09:48,071 --> 00:09:49,804
Yeah, I'll be there.

164
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:55,043
I have to go. I'm
on Sloan's post ops.

165
00:09:55,912 --> 00:09:57,578
I hate that you're so happy.

166
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,332
Derek, there's gonna be a
lot of dirty sex for you tonight.

167
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:02,767
Look forward to that.

168
00:10:05,789 --> 00:10:08,122
Hm... Hm.

169
00:10:08,224 --> 00:10:10,903
I'm looking at injuries to the
pulmonary artery and the vein.

170
00:10:10,927 --> 00:10:12,938
- Hold pressure in there.
- More lap bands.

171
00:10:12,962 --> 00:10:15,713
I'm going to try a
temporary Satinsky clamp.

172
00:10:15,816 --> 00:10:20,135
Dr. Altman, Mr. Linehan has
hemolytic anemia and elevated LDH.

173
00:10:20,237 --> 00:10:23,505
I suspect post-operative TTP. Shall
I start exchange plasmapheresis?

174
00:10:23,607 --> 00:10:26,674
- Yes. Good catch, Cristina.
- Hold on, Dr. Yang.

175
00:10:26,776 --> 00:10:29,555
We need to open up the
pericardium to gain proximal control.

176
00:10:29,579 --> 00:10:32,939
Dr. Yang should scrub in and
Mr. Linehan can wait for an hour.

177
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:35,666
No, thank you. I'd
rather not scrub in.

178
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:42,273
Keep this stable.
Dr. Altman, I'll be right back.

179
00:10:43,593 --> 00:10:46,944
- Cristina.
- You pursued me. I didn't.

180
00:10:47,046 --> 00:10:49,980
I gave you an out, and
you pursued me. You said...

181
00:10:50,082 --> 00:10:53,935
Do you love her?
Or do you love me?

182
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:03,094
I'm done. We're done.

183
00:11:04,131 --> 00:11:06,164
- Cristina...
- We're done.

184
00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:43,868
No...

185
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,591
Dr. Kepner...

186
00:11:52,846 --> 00:11:55,513
- April, what is it?
- Do you know I grew up
on a farm?

187
00:11:55,615 --> 00:11:57,849
- What happened?
- I...

188
00:11:57,951 --> 00:12:02,870
I grew up on a farm, so you
know, blood doesn't bother me, I...

189
00:12:02,973 --> 00:12:05,823
I slaughtered a pig once.
That was a lot of blood.

190
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:08,659
"Bleeding like a stuck
pig." That's a saying.

191
00:12:08,761 --> 00:12:10,773
To bleed like a pig, you
know. It means something.

192
00:12:10,797 --> 00:12:13,932
But you don't think of people
as having that much blood.

193
00:12:14,034 --> 00:12:16,934
I mean, you learn in med school
how many pints we all have in us,

194
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:18,614
but you don't realize
it until you see it.

195
00:12:18,638 --> 00:12:20,972
You don't get how much blood...

196
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:24,325
And a skinny person? I mean, my
God, Reed, she's almost anorexic.

197
00:12:24,444 --> 00:12:27,324
She's like, five pounds, you wouldn't
think she'd have that much blood,

198
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:30,348
- but she did. She did...
- April, April, April!

199
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:34,068
You're in shock. It's all
right. Tell me what happened.

200
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:36,904
Reed's dead.

201
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:38,806
Someone shot her.

202
00:12:52,305 --> 00:12:55,273
Excuse me, could you tell
me where to find the chief?

203
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:58,560
Dr. Shepherd? He's
probably in his office.

204
00:12:58,662 --> 00:13:01,429
Yeah, I've been
to his office before.

205
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:04,048
Can't seem to remember
how to get there.

206
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:06,117
Keep going in circles.

207
00:13:06,219 --> 00:13:10,221
It's in the east wing. That's
over by labs, across the catwalk.

208
00:13:10,323 --> 00:13:11,589
Sorry, that's...

209
00:13:11,691 --> 00:13:14,058
You've just gotta cross
through the patient floor on three,

210
00:13:14,161 --> 00:13:15,804
then follow the signs
to the main lobby

211
00:13:15,828 --> 00:13:18,163
and you should
find it, no problem.

212
00:13:18,265 --> 00:13:20,231
- Thank you.
- Mm-hm.

213
00:13:39,052 --> 00:13:40,718
Have a nice day.

214
00:13:41,454 --> 00:13:42,854
You, too.

215
00:13:55,719 --> 00:13:58,052
The police are on their
way. What's the procedure?

216
00:13:58,154 --> 00:14:00,266
You're the head of hospital
security. How do you not know?

217
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:02,874
I know it's never
happened before.

218
00:14:02,976 --> 00:14:05,509
I found it. "Lockdown.
Nobody moves in or out."

219
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:09,013
Yeah. Nobody moves, nobody
breathes until we know what's going on.

220
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:12,617
Here...

221
00:14:12,719 --> 00:14:13,918
Police are almost here.

222
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,564
I'm gonna leave you
here. You OK by yourself?

223
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:17,454
You're leaving... You just said

224
00:14:17,557 --> 00:14:19,501
that nobody leaves,
nobody moves...

225
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,125
Nobody but me.

226
00:14:21,228 --> 00:14:22,810
I'm the chief.
This is my hospital.

227
00:14:22,912 --> 00:14:26,680
- But what if you
get shot, or...
- Be right back. I'm the chief.

228
00:14:52,274 --> 00:14:55,292
- Jason Perkins?
- Got the chart here somewhere.

229
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:57,745
- Peds?
- Can you page
the younger Dr. Grey?

230
00:14:57,847 --> 00:15:00,047
Tell her to get my appy moving?

231
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:01,832
We're on lockdown.

232
00:15:01,934 --> 00:15:03,801
- What? Why?
- Oh, come on.

233
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,848
It's a joke, right? It's
a drill or something?

234
00:15:05,872 --> 00:15:09,624
OK. It's no joke.

235
00:15:09,726 --> 00:15:12,376
Everyone... everyone!

236
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:14,628
We're sealing the floor.

237
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:16,458
I don't know why and
it doesn't matter why

238
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:18,544
but nobody goes in or
out, past the double doors.

239
00:15:18,568 --> 00:15:20,930
Check on your own patients and
then come back and check and see

240
00:15:20,954 --> 00:15:23,849
if there's any others in the queue.
We don't have a lot of hands on deck.

241
00:15:23,873 --> 00:15:27,291
And people, do not alarm
the makers of the tiny humans.

242
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:28,659
They will eat you alive.

243
00:15:29,812 --> 00:15:32,525
- I really thought
that was a joke.
- Sick joke.

244
00:15:32,549 --> 00:15:34,242
- Excuse me?
- Uh... Nothing.

245
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:38,002
What? You can't be stuck
on the same floor as me?

246
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:41,205
- That's a hardship for you?
- Yeah. Frankly, it is.

247
00:15:43,592 --> 00:15:47,528
- Hey, how are you?
- Bill hasn't come back
with pizza yet.

248
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:48,929
So, still starving.

249
00:15:49,032 --> 00:15:52,282
But, full of fresh blood,
which is disgusting.

250
00:15:52,384 --> 00:15:55,319
- Like I'm a vampire.
- Mary, you complain too much.

251
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:57,338
But I do it with a smile.

252
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,708
Face it, I'm an awesome
patient. I make your day.

253
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:03,677
Let's see...

254
00:16:04,864 --> 00:16:09,834
- What's wrong?
- Nothing, just a... page.

255
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:11,363
I can't get control
of this artery.

256
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:13,949
- He's crashing!
- I need more light
and another clamp!

257
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:18,459
- How's it going in here?
- Touch and go!

258
00:16:19,161 --> 00:16:20,394
Avery, got a second?

259
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:25,669
- Has anybody
checked their pager?
- No, too busy.

260
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:27,718
There's a shooter
in the hospital.

261
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,888
I don't want you to say a
word. When the patient is stable,

262
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,310
I want you to tell
Hunt and Altman

263
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:35,292
that nobody goes out
of here until they are told.

264
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:39,997
- Can you handle this?
- Yes, sir.

265
00:16:41,867 --> 00:16:43,267
All right, then.

266
00:16:45,604 --> 00:16:47,038
OK, BP is dropping.

267
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:49,084
I've almost got the
pulmonary artery controlled.

268
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:51,942
- One more second.
- What did Shepherd want?

269
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:54,545
Dr. Avery?

270
00:16:54,647 --> 00:16:58,031
Nothing, just wanted to know
how long we'd be. He needs the OR.

271
00:16:58,134 --> 00:17:02,019
OK, get in here and suction
around where Dr. Altman's working.

272
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:08,426
Shaky hands, Dr. Avery?

273
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:11,646
Won't make it as a surgeon if
you can't keep your hands steady.

274
00:17:11,748 --> 00:17:13,313
Yes, sir.

275
00:17:18,087 --> 00:17:20,004
Hey.

276
00:17:21,274 --> 00:17:23,441
Did you get that page? Lockdown?

277
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:25,687
Yeah, I mean, whatever.
It means we can't leave.

278
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:27,844
I never leave here
anyway, so what do I care?

279
00:17:27,947 --> 00:17:30,648
Know what? It's probably just a
drill. Or a psych patient got out.

280
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,678
Or a baby went
missing from the nursery.

281
00:17:32,702 --> 00:17:35,653
Or there's an axe
murderer on the loose.

282
00:17:35,755 --> 00:17:38,289
- Axe murderer would be fun.
- Mm-hm.

283
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:41,058
So? How did he react?

284
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,611
Was his world made whole because
your womb is not empty and dry?

285
00:17:44,713 --> 00:17:46,597
Did he weep like a bitch baby?

286
00:17:46,699 --> 00:17:48,815
I didn't tell him because
he was in a mood.

287
00:17:48,935 --> 00:17:52,586
So I'll tell him later tonight or
something. It should be special, right?

288
00:17:52,688 --> 00:17:55,550
Well, you found out in the
ladies' room squatting over a stick.

289
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:58,209
That wasn't very special.
Why does he get special?

290
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:00,089
I don't know. I feel like
my head's gonna pop off

291
00:18:00,113 --> 00:18:02,546
because I haven't told him
and I want to and I hate that.

292
00:18:02,648 --> 00:18:04,198
It's good news. He
should know, right?

293
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,951
Mm-hm.

294
00:18:07,053 --> 00:18:09,648
- You know what? I'm telling him now.
- OK.

295
00:18:09,672 --> 00:18:12,373
- What...?
- I'm coming.

296
00:18:12,475 --> 00:18:14,736
- I wanna see
the bitch baby tears.
- Cristina...

297
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,280
I'll stand in the hallway.
He'll never know I'm there.

298
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:19,060
I, um...

299
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:24,101
- I broke up with Owen, OK?
- Oh.

300
00:18:24,904 --> 00:18:26,753
OK, come on.

301
00:18:29,909 --> 00:18:32,776
They want attending approval to
do the auditory evoked potentials.

302
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:34,490
- Can you sign for it?
- Lockdown.

303
00:18:34,514 --> 00:18:37,047
Kind of crazy, right?
Think it's serious?

304
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:39,533
- Can you just sign...
- This Karev thing serious?

305
00:18:39,635 --> 00:18:41,235
- Mark...
- I miss you.

306
00:18:41,303 --> 00:18:44,538
- Can you just sign the order?
- Sir, you can't leave this
area.

307
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,924
The hospital is in...

308
00:18:47,026 --> 00:18:50,077
- Get down,
get down! Get down!
- What just happened?!

309
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:53,197
Let's get out of here!

310
00:18:55,785 --> 00:18:57,751
No. No, no, no...

311
00:18:57,853 --> 00:18:59,737
- No, no, no.
- Come on!

312
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:02,839
- She's dead. She's dead.
- Come on. I'm getting you
out of here.

313
00:19:08,414 --> 00:19:11,932
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- Come on! Come on!

314
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:25,507
Two more units on that side!

315
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,867
Goes corner to corner.

316
00:19:30,953 --> 00:19:33,621
- Waiting for a...
- OK, let's go.

317
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:39,760
Excuse me.

318
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:42,630
Guys, go around...

319
00:19:42,732 --> 00:19:44,843
Have you talked to
the administrator? Sir!

320
00:19:44,867 --> 00:19:47,045
- Officer! What's the situation?
- You gotta stand back.

321
00:19:47,069 --> 00:19:49,736
I'm Richard Webber. I'm
the chief... I'm the former...

322
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:53,474
Look, this is my
hospital. What's going on?

323
00:19:53,576 --> 00:19:55,187
A shooter took down
one of the doctors.

324
00:19:55,211 --> 00:19:58,228
We're not sure whether or
not he's still inside. No, sir!

325
00:19:58,314 --> 00:20:01,426
No one in, no one out. The
SWAT team is on the way, sir.

326
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:04,335
- No one in, no one out.
- Are you evacuating people?

327
00:20:04,437 --> 00:20:07,838
- Are you getting them out?
- Department policy
is a lockdown.

328
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:10,085
Until we know who the
shooter is, where the shooter is,

329
00:20:10,109 --> 00:20:12,020
everyone stays
in the same place.

330
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,973
- It's safer that way.
- Those are my people!

331
00:20:13,997 --> 00:20:16,763
- If someone is shooting...
- My guys have this. We do.

332
00:20:16,866 --> 00:20:18,146
We're gonna take care of it.

333
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:20,665
OK?

334
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:23,537
OK.

335
00:20:24,941 --> 00:20:26,841
What happened?

336
00:20:36,719 --> 00:20:38,469
I grabbed everything
I could think of.

337
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:42,490
I am so incredibly
pissed off right now.

338
00:20:42,592 --> 00:20:45,909
- Alex, you've been shot.
- - Have to get him out of here.

339
00:20:46,011 --> 00:20:48,190
He could come back, Mark.
We have to get him out of here.

340
00:20:48,214 --> 00:20:49,480
There's no exit wound.

341
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:51,465
No exit wound. We're
gonna have to flip him.

342
00:20:51,567 --> 00:20:53,178
Lexie, grab him
under the shoulders.

343
00:20:53,202 --> 00:20:54,802
We have to get him out of here.

344
00:20:54,904 --> 00:20:58,272
He's losing blood. We can't
move him, now shut up and help!

345
00:21:01,393 --> 00:21:04,211
Nothing. Damn, the bullet's
still in there somewhere.

346
00:21:04,313 --> 00:21:05,596
We're gonna have to wing it.

347
00:21:05,698 --> 00:21:07,109
Start an IV. I'll set
up a chest tube.

348
00:21:07,133 --> 00:21:10,050
You're gonna be
OK, Alex. All right?

349
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:14,355
I'm gonna kick that
guy's ass when I see him.

350
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:20,300
Has anyone seen
Olivia Kagan's chart?

351
00:21:20,395 --> 00:21:22,574
I need albuterol meds
for the asthma kid.

352
00:21:22,598 --> 00:21:24,848
Time for 18's dose of
ceftriaxone. 34 needs his mommy

353
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,830
and the kid in 35
won't stop crying.

354
00:21:26,886 --> 00:21:29,937
We have, what, 42 kids? Four doctors
and nine nurses? That's not enough.

355
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:31,989
Why don't you put all
the kids in the playroom?

356
00:21:32,091 --> 00:21:34,041
We don't have enough
staff for a whole floor.

357
00:21:34,143 --> 00:21:35,554
At least they'll all
be in one place.

358
00:21:35,578 --> 00:21:37,322
We can keep an
eye on all at once.

359
00:21:37,346 --> 00:21:40,298
You can't put a bunch of sick
kids in the playroom with their beds.

360
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,549
Sure we can.

361
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:43,361
Stable ones can walk
and we have wheelchairs,

362
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:45,252
so let's do it. Move.

363
00:21:45,371 --> 00:21:48,021
- Thanks!
- Whatever.

364
00:21:49,675 --> 00:21:52,109
- Do you want to talk about it?
- No.

365
00:21:52,211 --> 00:21:53,822
- Owen, I mean.
- I know what you mean.

366
00:21:53,846 --> 00:21:57,347
I don't want to...
I can't. It's just...

367
00:21:58,684 --> 00:22:01,719
OK, he doesn't
know who he loves.

368
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:05,255
And if it's not me, then... I
don't want to talk about it.

369
00:22:05,357 --> 00:22:07,758
- Let's talk about
something else.
- OK.

370
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:10,461
You realize you're
about to be a godmother.

371
00:22:10,563 --> 00:22:12,296
I'm godmother?

372
00:22:12,398 --> 00:22:15,582
OK, what do I have to do? Talk God
to the fetus? I'm not gonna do that.

373
00:22:15,684 --> 00:22:18,952
It means you take
care of the kid if I die.

374
00:22:19,054 --> 00:22:20,687
Derek takes care
of the kid if you die.

375
00:22:20,789 --> 00:22:22,389
If we die, if we die.

376
00:22:22,492 --> 00:22:25,759
OK, so, if you and Derek are
in a plane crash and you die,

377
00:22:25,861 --> 00:22:29,262
- the kid is mine?
- Yes.

378
00:22:29,364 --> 00:22:32,683
Have to admit, I kinda hope
you and Derek die, just a little bit.

379
00:22:32,785 --> 00:22:34,668
So I can raise the kid
with decent priorities.

380
00:22:34,771 --> 00:22:37,404
- I have priorities.
- Oh?

381
00:22:37,506 --> 00:22:39,372
- Surgery.
- OK, then.

382
00:22:39,475 --> 00:22:42,576
You can raise a good
little surgeon. I take it back.

383
00:22:42,678 --> 00:22:44,778
Hey, what are you doing here?

384
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,564
- Uh... Walking.
- We're in lockdown.

385
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:49,266
We're not walking outside.

386
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:51,802
That's not what lockdown means.
It means stay where you are.

387
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:54,939
- Did you know that's what...?
- No, I thought it meant...

388
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:56,385
- Get in here.
- Why are we...?

389
00:22:56,409 --> 00:22:57,952
There's a shooter
loose in the hospital.

390
00:22:57,976 --> 00:22:59,388
- What?
- Stay here. Don't move.

391
00:22:59,412 --> 00:23:01,140
I'll come back and
get you when it's clear.

392
00:23:01,164 --> 00:23:03,313
Just stay here. Don't move.

393
00:23:06,735 --> 00:23:08,519
Your pulse is coming down.

394
00:23:08,621 --> 00:23:11,271
We have to check
your blood counts,

395
00:23:11,373 --> 00:23:16,609
but I think you'll be good
to go for surgery tomorrow.

396
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,647
That's the fifth time
you've checked your pager.

397
00:23:21,434 --> 00:23:24,000
Uh... It's... habit.

398
00:23:24,103 --> 00:23:27,120
Dr. B., my husband's
late. He's never late.

399
00:23:27,222 --> 00:23:29,206
And you're hanging out with me.

400
00:23:29,308 --> 00:23:32,326
You don't really strike me
as the hanging out type.

401
00:23:32,428 --> 00:23:33,827
What's going on?

402
00:23:34,781 --> 00:23:38,015
OK, there is a situation.

403
00:23:38,117 --> 00:23:43,053
I'm not exactly sure what it is,
but hospital procedure dictates

404
00:23:43,155 --> 00:23:46,390
- that when we're on a...
- He's on the floor.

405
00:23:46,492 --> 00:23:48,012
- Who?
- The shooter.

406
00:23:48,043 --> 00:23:50,577
A shoot... There's a
shooter in the hospital?

407
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:52,646
Oh, my God.

408
00:23:52,748 --> 00:23:54,381
It's all right, all right?

409
00:23:54,483 --> 00:23:56,443
Put the gun down. Come
on, man, don't do anything.

410
00:23:58,421 --> 00:23:59,586
No, please!

411
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:05,425
- Dr. Percy, hide!
- What?

412
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:07,862
Just hide! Mary, play dead.

413
00:24:07,964 --> 00:24:09,190
Wait, what's happening?

414
00:24:09,214 --> 00:24:12,015
Shh! Just do not
move. Do not breathe.

415
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:14,752
Dr. Percy, go hide now!

416
00:24:45,084 --> 00:24:47,267
Oh...

417
00:24:49,588 --> 00:24:51,087
This is too much.

418
00:24:52,608 --> 00:24:55,008
OK... OK...

419
00:24:56,378 --> 00:24:57,961
OK... OK...

420
00:24:58,063 --> 00:25:00,297
OK...

421
00:25:00,399 --> 00:25:04,184
OK. OK.

422
00:25:12,645 --> 00:25:14,765
- Please, I...
- Are you a surgeon?

423
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:16,930
Please.

424
00:25:17,032 --> 00:25:19,532
Are you a surgeon?

425
00:25:19,634 --> 00:25:22,369
Yes, sir. Yes, sir, I am.

426
00:25:22,471 --> 00:25:25,139
Oh, no. No, no! No, please!

427
00:25:53,735 --> 00:25:56,169
No! Don't!

428
00:25:56,271 --> 00:25:58,505
Are you a surgeon?

429
00:25:58,607 --> 00:26:00,273
Answer me!

430
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:07,114
No!

431
00:26:07,216 --> 00:26:10,250
No! I'm a...

432
00:26:11,586 --> 00:26:15,222
a nurse. I'm a nurse.

433
00:26:15,324 --> 00:26:18,859
I'm a... nurse.

434
00:26:26,552 --> 00:26:28,134
I'm sorry...

435
00:26:29,571 --> 00:26:31,454
for the trouble.

436
00:26:33,376 --> 00:26:36,026
For the mess.

437
00:26:37,797 --> 00:26:38,862
I'm sorry.

438
00:27:01,354 --> 00:27:05,054
You're doing great,
Alex, really great. Now...

439
00:27:05,157 --> 00:27:07,741
I need to put in a chest
tube. You're with me, OK?

440
00:27:07,843 --> 00:27:09,943
No chest tube.

441
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:12,563
I'm OK. Don't cut me.

442
00:27:12,665 --> 00:27:16,066
Lexie, you get the Betadine
ready. I'll do the rest, OK?

443
00:27:16,168 --> 00:27:17,618
OK.

444
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,753
OK.

445
00:27:19,855 --> 00:27:21,922
Oh, my God.

446
00:27:24,109 --> 00:27:26,643
Shut him up. Shut him up.

447
00:27:26,745 --> 00:27:29,145
Oh, my God. Oh, God.

448
00:27:29,247 --> 00:27:31,298
Shhh!

449
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,000
Alex...

450
00:27:33,102 --> 00:27:35,402
OK, OK...

451
00:27:37,506 --> 00:27:40,452
Shut him up, Lexie. If that guy
with the gun hears the screaming,

452
00:27:40,476 --> 00:27:44,010
he's gonna head this way.
Now do something to shut him up!

453
00:27:45,114 --> 00:27:46,947
OK, OK. Alex? Shh!

454
00:27:47,049 --> 00:27:49,783
I know that it hurts,
but you have to be quiet.

455
00:27:50,785 --> 00:27:52,769
OK?

456
00:27:52,871 --> 00:27:55,839
Lexie!

457
00:27:58,543 --> 00:28:00,522
I'm sorry.

458
00:28:00,546 --> 00:28:02,596
I'm sorry. Shh...

459
00:28:02,697 --> 00:28:05,298
The bad news is, less
privacy. But the good news is,

460
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:09,620
your bunny can make friends with
a very attractive bear down the hall.

461
00:28:09,722 --> 00:28:12,256
- Hey, watch it.
- Sorry. Sorry.

462
00:28:12,358 --> 00:28:14,402
I thought we were
gonna be friends.

463
00:28:14,426 --> 00:28:15,759
You want to talk about this now?

464
00:28:15,861 --> 00:28:18,006
We're in lockdown, moving kids,
God knows what's happening,

465
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:20,230
- and you wanna talk about this?
- We're stuck here.

466
00:28:20,332 --> 00:28:22,677
We have to be together, so,
yeah, I wanna talk about this.

467
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:24,134
OK. Fine.

468
00:28:24,236 --> 00:28:25,469
I tried being friends.

469
00:28:25,571 --> 00:28:27,454
Rising above. Tried
that and I'm over it.

470
00:28:27,556 --> 00:28:30,236
I'm gonna go the more traditional
route of totally hating your guts.

471
00:28:32,394 --> 00:28:33,560
OK.

472
00:28:33,662 --> 00:28:35,439
Christopher? Tyler.
Tyler? Christopher.

473
00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:38,098
You both hate chicken. Discuss.

474
00:28:39,701 --> 00:28:41,868
Whoa, whoa, whoa, I
don't deserve this, OK?

475
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:44,971
I have treated you with
nothing but respect and love...

476
00:28:45,073 --> 00:28:46,584
You think you have,
but you haven't.

477
00:28:46,608 --> 00:28:48,648
I'm sure it feels great to
act like I'm the bad guy,

478
00:28:48,693 --> 00:28:50,527
but that's the biggest
load of you-know-what.

479
00:28:50,629 --> 00:28:52,791
I've spent the last month
trying to convince myself

480
00:28:52,815 --> 00:28:54,593
that I don't need
kids to be happy.

481
00:28:54,617 --> 00:28:57,362
Giving lectures to myself, saying
it out loud to you and to Mark.

482
00:28:57,386 --> 00:29:00,403
Turning myself inside out
to want what you wanted

483
00:29:00,505 --> 00:29:02,851
and then I stopped and I
thought: Did you ever try?

484
00:29:02,875 --> 00:29:05,253
To imagine what it would
be like? To change for me?

485
00:29:05,277 --> 00:29:07,678
Because I don't think you
did. You dismissed my dream.

486
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:10,763
Which says to me that you
don't give a rat's ass if I'm happy.

487
00:29:10,865 --> 00:29:14,462
I never understood squat about who
you are and now I do and I don't like it.

488
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:16,219
Oh, really, really?

489
00:29:16,321 --> 00:29:18,905
I'm supposed to change for
you? Why? 'Cause we're in love?

490
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:20,285
Because you fall
in love all the time.

491
00:29:20,309 --> 00:29:22,909
- Men, women...
- Excuse me! Dr. Robbins.

492
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:24,311
I don't feel good!

493
00:29:26,065 --> 00:29:28,282
Oh, my. Oh, my...

494
00:29:28,384 --> 00:29:31,635
- He shot me. He shot me. I'm shot.
- You're going to be OK.

495
00:29:31,737 --> 00:29:36,690
Mary, over there, some gauze
and surgical pads. Get them for me.

496
00:29:36,791 --> 00:29:41,027
No, I gotta go. I gotta go
home. We shouldn't be here.

497
00:29:41,129 --> 00:29:43,196
My husband, I have
to find my husband.

498
00:29:43,298 --> 00:29:45,849
- And that man,
he could come back...
- Mary!

499
00:29:45,951 --> 00:29:48,551
You're not going anywhere.
That man is not coming back.

500
00:29:48,637 --> 00:29:51,772
I need you to pull yourself
together and bring me those supplies.

501
00:29:51,874 --> 00:29:54,274
OK?

502
00:29:56,195 --> 00:29:59,645
- I was doing charts
and now I'm shot?
- OK, you're just fine.

503
00:29:59,748 --> 00:30:01,465
You're just fine.

504
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:04,601
Good, very good.

505
00:30:04,953 --> 00:30:06,052
OK...

506
00:30:06,154 --> 00:30:08,338
All right, Mary?

507
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,440
Go over to the window

508
00:30:10,542 --> 00:30:14,611
and see if there's anybody
out there that can help us.

509
00:30:16,364 --> 00:30:18,381
Mary, come on, come on!

510
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:21,484
Go to the window now! See if
somebody can help us. Go on.

511
00:30:21,586 --> 00:30:24,571
Go on! OK?

512
00:30:27,425 --> 00:30:30,644
Um... There's... There's...

513
00:30:32,197 --> 00:30:33,931
a dead security guard.

514
00:30:34,033 --> 00:30:35,732
He's dead.

515
00:30:36,618 --> 00:30:38,752
There's no one else to help us.

516
00:30:38,853 --> 00:30:40,420
There's no one else.

517
00:30:46,729 --> 00:30:48,061
That's fine.

518
00:30:48,163 --> 00:30:49,863
That's...

519
00:30:52,334 --> 00:30:55,352
Where's that...
water coming from?

520
00:30:55,454 --> 00:30:57,955
Dr. Bailey? You're crying.

521
00:30:59,758 --> 00:31:00,974
You're crying.

522
00:31:03,912 --> 00:31:08,682
Mary, you need to come over,
wipe my face so I can keep working.

523
00:31:10,852 --> 00:31:13,520
OK, OK, OK...

524
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:19,877
OK. We're all gonna be fine.

525
00:31:21,463 --> 00:31:24,698
- OK, he's ready for transport.
- Jackson, get him up to ICU.

526
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,900
- Start warming him up...
- I can't, sir.

527
00:31:28,002 --> 00:31:30,353
- Excuse me?
- We can't leave here.

528
00:31:30,455 --> 00:31:32,005
That's what Shepherd told me.

529
00:31:32,107 --> 00:31:33,689
There's a shooter
in the hospital.

530
00:31:33,792 --> 00:31:35,353
- We're supposed to...
- There's a what?

531
00:31:35,377 --> 00:31:37,944
- Shepherd said...
- This patient is hypothermic.

532
00:31:38,046 --> 00:31:40,863
Start warming him up before
he starts to circle the drain.

533
00:31:40,966 --> 00:31:43,216
You didn't bother to
mention this until now?

534
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:45,318
- You didn't bother...
- Shepherd said...

535
00:31:45,371 --> 00:31:47,487
You already told me
what Shepherd said!

536
00:31:50,458 --> 00:31:51,992
OK...

537
00:31:52,094 --> 00:31:55,111
I'll take him up myself.
Everyone else, stay here.

538
00:31:55,213 --> 00:31:57,130
- I'm coming.
- No, you stay put.

539
00:31:57,232 --> 00:32:01,484
I'm a cardiothoracic surgeon. He
has a penetrating injury to his chest.

540
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:04,838
You don't get a vote this
time. I'm coming. Let's go.

541
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:06,305
OK.

542
00:32:07,942 --> 00:32:09,804
Her blood pressure's
90/60 and dropping.

543
00:32:09,828 --> 00:32:11,828
Let's hang more fluids.

544
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,074
I have the portable ultrasound.

545
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:15,665
Check her
appendix. I'll be back!

546
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:18,818
When are you gonna forgive me for
not being a good enough lesbian for you?

547
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:21,571
When you do convince me
that you're falling in love with me

548
00:32:21,673 --> 00:32:23,022
and not with being in love.

549
00:32:23,124 --> 00:32:25,420
When you convince me that I'm
different than George O'Malley,

550
00:32:25,444 --> 00:32:28,261
Erica Hahn, Mark Sloan,
the girl at the coffee cart...

551
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:30,041
You have a huge heart,
and I love that about you.

552
00:32:30,065 --> 00:32:32,648
But I don't trust
you. Why would I?

553
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:35,968
Dr. Robbins!

554
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:37,132
Her appendix...

555
00:32:47,582 --> 00:32:49,499
- You OK?
- I've been hurling

556
00:32:49,601 --> 00:32:52,502
every day this week,
around... yep, right on schedule.

557
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:57,407
OK, we gotta get out of here,
'cause I'm not staying in here

558
00:32:57,509 --> 00:33:00,677
after you stink up this
place with your vomit.

559
00:33:06,334 --> 00:33:08,718
Oh, my God! Meredith, get down!

560
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,604
- What, what?
- Shh, shh!

561
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:20,247
- I...
- Shh!

562
00:33:26,071 --> 00:33:28,422
That's the guy
from the elevator.

563
00:33:29,725 --> 00:33:31,903
- What do you mean?
- It's the guy
from the elevator.

564
00:33:31,927 --> 00:33:35,361
He asked me for directions,
how to get to the chief's office.

565
00:33:36,298 --> 00:33:38,264
- I don't...
- Meredith,

566
00:33:38,366 --> 00:33:41,334
the guy with the gun
is looking for Derek.

567
00:33:49,911 --> 00:33:51,978
Dr. Shepherd?

568
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,108
Sir, you shouldn't
be here. It's not safe.

569
00:33:54,132 --> 00:33:56,383
I know it's not safe here.

570
00:33:56,485 --> 00:34:00,387
That's the point.
This hospital isn't safe.

571
00:34:00,489 --> 00:34:03,356
You don't recognize me, do you?

572
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:07,426
Mr. Clark.

573
00:34:07,529 --> 00:34:11,248
Sorry, I have a situation. You should
go someplace safe so you don't get hurt.

574
00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:13,516
I'm already hurt.

575
00:34:17,372 --> 00:34:21,374
You hurt me when you
decided to kill my wife.

576
00:34:25,997 --> 00:34:28,432
- BP's 60/palp.
- He's losing a lot of blood.

577
00:34:28,534 --> 00:34:31,000
Damn it. He needs a transfusion.

578
00:34:31,102 --> 00:34:33,286
I don't know what
we're gonna do.

579
00:34:36,475 --> 00:34:39,158
I'll go. I'll go get it.

580
00:34:40,061 --> 00:34:41,828
That's insane. I'll go.

581
00:34:41,930 --> 00:34:47,483
No. I don't know what to do.
You know what to do. I don't...

582
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,936
I can't do nothing.

583
00:34:50,706 --> 00:34:52,472
Alex?

584
00:34:52,574 --> 00:34:55,008
Don't die. Please don't die.

585
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:58,344
OK? It's me. It's Lexie.

586
00:34:59,047 --> 00:35:00,146
I will be right back.

587
00:35:00,248 --> 00:35:02,148
I will be right back.

588
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:12,175
Hey, Sloan.

589
00:35:12,277 --> 00:35:14,560
Try not to kill me.

590
00:35:14,662 --> 00:35:16,913
Doing my best.

591
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:28,241
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

592
00:35:30,061 --> 00:35:32,144
- Mr. Clark.
- Shut up. No talking.

593
00:35:32,247 --> 00:35:34,197
You're not the man here.

594
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:35,798
I'm the man.

595
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,984
I'm the man.

596
00:35:41,422 --> 00:35:43,656
I told my wife I would be.

597
00:35:44,626 --> 00:35:46,960
I'm the man.

598
00:35:47,062 --> 00:35:51,430
And a man looks after
his wife. But I didn't.

599
00:35:51,532 --> 00:35:53,650
I let you decide
that she should die.

600
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,054
I wasn't a man then.

601
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:00,339
But I'm a man now.

602
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:05,411
No, no, no...

603
00:36:07,098 --> 00:36:11,084
Mary, Mary, see the
sticky circles there?

604
00:36:11,186 --> 00:36:12,519
Give me three of those.

605
00:36:12,621 --> 00:36:16,222
There. And... Mary! Get
me three of those, please.

606
00:36:16,324 --> 00:36:18,274
And the other thingy.

607
00:36:20,545 --> 00:36:22,028
Yeah.

608
00:36:23,398 --> 00:36:25,281
- It's this thing?
- No, not that.

609
00:36:25,383 --> 00:36:27,433
The other thing with the wires.

610
00:36:28,737 --> 00:36:31,787
- I'm dying.
- Shh! Shh! No, you're not dying.

611
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:34,190
Don't lie to me.

612
00:36:34,292 --> 00:36:36,003
Don't tell me that
lie we tell everybody,

613
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:38,695
"You're fine.
You're doing great."

614
00:36:38,797 --> 00:36:40,597
Don't lie to me.

615
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:43,483
Please, you gotta promise
to tell me the truth, OK?

616
00:36:43,585 --> 00:36:47,904
You are not dying. If you
were, I would tell you, OK?

617
00:36:48,006 --> 00:36:49,138
OK.

618
00:36:49,241 --> 00:36:51,741
OK, that's there...

619
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:55,979
Shh! You are not dying!

620
00:36:56,081 --> 00:36:59,048
Mary, hold Dr. Percy's
hand, please.

621
00:37:08,209 --> 00:37:09,859
Stay here.

622
00:37:09,961 --> 00:37:12,695
What kind of hospital is this?

623
00:37:13,815 --> 00:37:15,898
It isn't safe here.

624
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,819
Somebody has to
protect people. From you.

625
00:37:20,789 --> 00:37:23,339
Handing down
judgments like you're God.

626
00:37:24,475 --> 00:37:27,460
- Mr. Clark...
- You don't get to be God!

627
00:37:28,462 --> 00:37:30,313
No talking!

628
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:37,237
Mr. Clark, listen to me.

629
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:43,793
I know your loss.

630
00:37:43,895 --> 00:37:46,329
I lost my father.

631
00:37:46,431 --> 00:37:49,099
When I was a kid.

632
00:37:49,201 --> 00:37:51,367
Two guys killed my
father for his watch.

633
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:52,785
Right in front of me.

634
00:37:54,906 --> 00:37:56,489
Right in front of me.

635
00:37:58,075 --> 00:38:01,344
I didn't become a doctor
because I wanted to be God.

636
00:38:02,447 --> 00:38:05,265
I became a doctor because
I wanted to save lives.

637
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:10,887
Look at me.

638
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:13,490
Please.

639
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:15,958
Look at me in the eye.

640
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:20,997
I'm a human being.

641
00:38:22,367 --> 00:38:24,000
I make mistakes.

642
00:38:24,636 --> 00:38:26,068
I'm flawed.

643
00:38:27,706 --> 00:38:29,238
We all are.

644
00:38:30,909 --> 00:38:35,061
Today, I think... for
you, it's just a mistake.

645
00:38:37,382 --> 00:38:39,148
You want justice.

646
00:38:41,970 --> 00:38:43,936
You want somebody to pay.

647
00:38:47,726 --> 00:38:51,627
You're a good man. I
can see that in your eyes.

648
00:38:59,721 --> 00:39:01,654
Can you see it in mine?

649
00:39:03,257 --> 00:39:04,824
Can you?

650
00:39:21,759 --> 00:39:24,444
Dr. Shepherd! Thank
God you're back!

651
00:39:46,701 --> 00:39:49,369
<i>I learned to read
in the OR gallery.</i>

652
00:39:49,471 --> 00:39:51,237
<i>I played in the morgue.</i>

653
00:39:51,339 --> 00:39:55,658
<i>I colored with crayons
on old ER charts.</i>

654
00:40:00,348 --> 00:40:04,350
<i>A hospital was my
church. My school.</i>

655
00:40:04,452 --> 00:40:07,687
<i>My home. My safe place.</i>

656
00:40:07,789 --> 00:40:10,056
<i>My sanctuary.</i>

657
00:40:10,158 --> 00:40:12,292
<i>I love it here.</i>

658
00:40:14,262 --> 00:40:17,814
<i>Correction: Loved it here.</i>
