1
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:08,218
<i>It's a common belief
that positive thinking</i>

2
00:00:08,242 --> 00:00:11,276
<i>leads to a happier,
healthier life.</i>

3
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:15,981
Stop fidgeting. Smile.

4
00:00:16,083 --> 00:00:18,616
I hate ties. You're
the one that's fidgeting.

5
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:21,453
I'm wearing a thing
that sucks in my fat.

6
00:00:21,555 --> 00:00:23,021
You don't have any fat.

7
00:00:23,107 --> 00:00:26,207
I couldn't zip the
dress without it.

8
00:00:26,309 --> 00:00:28,861
- I have fat.
- That's just your ass.

9
00:00:28,963 --> 00:00:31,113
I like it fat.

10
00:00:31,215 --> 00:00:33,281
Thank you. That's... disturbing,

11
00:00:33,383 --> 00:00:35,249
but kind of awesome.

12
00:00:36,603 --> 00:00:39,938
- Wanna go
upstairs and make out?
- We're supporting Derek.

13
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,074
Why? His party blows.

14
00:00:42,176 --> 00:00:45,310
This whole wall will be windows, so
we can take advantage of the view.

15
00:00:45,412 --> 00:00:47,446
- Nice.
- Broken ground yet?

16
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:48,763
The day I was named chief.

17
00:00:48,865 --> 00:00:52,284
At my parties, we drink
beer and dance on tables.

18
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:55,720
- Are you insulting my party?
- It's getting kind
of lame out there.

19
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:57,890
Duty calls.

20
00:00:57,992 --> 00:00:59,936
<i>As children we're told to smile</i>

21
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,028
<i>and be cheerful and
put on a happy face.</i>

22
00:01:08,752 --> 00:01:11,953
<i>As adults we're told to
look on the bright side.</i>

23
00:01:12,055 --> 00:01:15,257
<i>To make lemonade and
see glasses as half full.</i>

24
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:18,259
- You're staring again.
- I am not.

25
00:01:18,362 --> 00:01:21,324
Wanna go to my place and do it
in the shower? Teddy's in surgery.

26
00:01:21,348 --> 00:01:24,382
I'm not in the mood for
your jokes right now, OK?

27
00:01:30,724 --> 00:01:33,724
<i>Sometimes reality can
get in the way of our ability</i>

28
00:01:33,761 --> 00:01:35,093
<i>to act the happy part, though.</i>

29
00:01:35,195 --> 00:01:37,062
- Napkin?
- Thank you!

30
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,828
I'm getting first dibs
on all the finger food

31
00:01:41,852 --> 00:01:44,230
before it gets sucked
down by the masses.

32
00:01:44,254 --> 00:01:45,920
Thank you!

33
00:01:46,924 --> 00:01:48,307
Let's move in together.

34
00:01:50,727 --> 00:01:53,695
Good. You can't answer.
It's good. I don't want you to.

35
00:01:53,797 --> 00:01:57,498
I ran it past my shrink. She thinks
it's a good idea. So think about it.

36
00:01:57,601 --> 00:02:00,168
- Me, you in our own place.
- Yes.

37
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:02,770
- What...? Yes?
- Yes. Yes.

38
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:04,739
Yes, yes, but I need to warn you

39
00:02:04,841 --> 00:02:06,558
that this is my fourth martini,

40
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:09,461
and my judgment
is severely impaired.

41
00:02:09,563 --> 00:02:11,263
Also,

42
00:02:11,365 --> 00:02:14,416
- I'm a real easy lay right now.
- Works for me.

43
00:02:17,538 --> 00:02:19,754
- I'm going in.
- No, you can't.

44
00:02:19,856 --> 00:02:23,842
It's inappropriate! This is the
chief's house, right, Jackson?

45
00:02:23,944 --> 00:02:26,094
No. Go ahead, girl. Get yours.

46
00:02:27,947 --> 00:02:31,850
<i>Your health can fail,
boyfriends can cheat.</i>

47
00:02:31,952 --> 00:02:33,618
<i>Friends can disappoint.</i>

48
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:37,200
Dr. Sloan, I just wanted to say
your work today with Dr. Shepherd

49
00:02:37,274 --> 00:02:40,075
on that acoustic
neuroma was amazing.

50
00:02:40,711 --> 00:02:43,278
I was inspired.

51
00:02:45,014 --> 00:02:47,115
You need another drink.

52
00:02:53,457 --> 00:02:57,058
<i>It's in these moments when
you just want to get real.</i>

53
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,661
<i>To drop the act
and be your true,</i>

54
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:03,999
- <i>scared, unhappy self.</i>
- OK...

55
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:06,901
OK, look, I just
want to tell you

56
00:03:07,003 --> 00:03:10,222
that I will not have
my personal business

57
00:03:10,324 --> 00:03:14,342
all over the hospital like every
other little resident ho there.

58
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:19,014
So therefore, you will
not flirt with me at work...

59
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:21,650
Listen, listen. You
will not kiss me at work,

60
00:03:21,752 --> 00:03:24,536
you will not... look at me

61
00:03:24,638 --> 00:03:27,706
with the "I have seen
you naked" eyes at work.

62
00:03:27,808 --> 00:03:31,059
What we do in the bedroom,
stays in the bedroom.

63
00:03:31,161 --> 00:03:33,362
I'm a professional woman

64
00:03:33,464 --> 00:03:36,431
with a stellar
reputation. More import...

65
00:03:37,233 --> 00:03:38,700
importantly, I'm a lady.

66
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:43,805
And a lady does not show
her drawers at the office.

67
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:53,298
Now, woman,

68
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,917
I am naked and I look good.

69
00:03:56,019 --> 00:03:58,252
Now, you gonna sit
there and lecture me,

70
00:03:58,354 --> 00:04:00,066
or you gonna let me
take you to my bedroom

71
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:01,857
and have my way with you?

72
00:04:10,234 --> 00:04:12,134
OK... My shoe...

73
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:19,290
Mark? Hello? The
door's unlocked.

74
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:21,392
I'm sorry I couldn't
meet you earlier,

75
00:04:21,495 --> 00:04:23,495
you would not believe my night.

76
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:26,431
My post-op dissection
repair coded.

77
00:04:26,533 --> 00:04:28,917
I had to open him up bedside...

78
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:37,225
OK.

79
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:39,744
Wow!

80
00:04:42,599 --> 00:04:44,499
Well...

81
00:04:44,601 --> 00:04:47,585
this could be fun if
we decide to let it.

82
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:58,589
You and Owen are thinking
of moving in together?

83
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:00,765
Not thinking. Doing.

84
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:05,503
Mer. Frickin' speak.

85
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:07,684
OK. I think there
might be something

86
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:10,442
going on between Owen and Teddy.

87
00:05:10,544 --> 00:05:13,512
Wow. OK. There's nothing's
going on between Owen and Teddy.

88
00:05:13,614 --> 00:05:15,213
I'm saying I'm pretty sure.

89
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,350
OK, how? How are you sure?

90
00:05:18,452 --> 00:05:20,012
I can't say. And I
don't really know,

91
00:05:20,036 --> 00:05:21,747
I'm just saying
think before you do.

92
00:05:21,771 --> 00:05:23,483
- That's all.
- You know what? That's crap.

93
00:05:23,507 --> 00:05:25,918
- Meredith...
- I gotta go. I'm late
for rounds.

94
00:05:25,942 --> 00:05:27,942
We're totally not
done with this!

95
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:30,445
And when Mark
proposed a threesome,

96
00:05:30,547 --> 00:05:32,130
she looked at me.

97
00:05:32,232 --> 00:05:35,267
Like she was thinking about it.

98
00:05:35,369 --> 00:05:39,254
Well, she is cute. Like a
brunette surgical Tinker Bell.

99
00:05:39,356 --> 00:05:42,657
- Who's that?
- Nothing. I walked in on Mark

100
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,726
and Reed Adamson last night.

101
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:48,830
- So he cheated on you.
- No, he didn't cheat on me.

102
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:51,099
We're dating non-exclusively.
He's not my boyfriend.

103
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:55,320
OK, gotta run.
Hear the rest later?

104
00:05:55,422 --> 00:05:58,000
Listen, if you want me to say
something to him, I can say something.

105
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:00,725
Owen, I do not need
you to defend my honor.

106
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:02,994
You can stand down now.

107
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:17,676
Yes, Andrew, I said
surgery. Now... Wait, wait.

108
00:06:17,778 --> 00:06:20,711
Would you explain to my son
why he doesn't need to worry?

109
00:06:20,813 --> 00:06:22,581
Hello? Hi.

110
00:06:22,683 --> 00:06:25,850
Your mom has some broken bones in
her forearm, but we're gonna put some

111
00:06:25,953 --> 00:06:28,431
small metal plates in, and
she'll be discharged tomorrow.

112
00:06:28,455 --> 00:06:30,221
See, dear? Don't
jump on a plane.

113
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:33,358
I'm gonna call you
right after surgery.

114
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:36,878
Well, love you, too,
darling. Bye-bye.

115
00:06:37,714 --> 00:06:40,999
My son, a lawyer. He's single.

116
00:06:41,101 --> 00:06:45,319
- Very nice. A little bit older.
- I'm dating someone, kind of...

117
00:06:45,421 --> 00:06:48,306
What about you, Reed?
You go for older guys, right?

118
00:06:50,761 --> 00:06:54,479
- Was it something I said?
- Oh, no, no. It's not you.

119
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:58,934
- What do we have?
- Henry Stamm, 75,

120
00:06:59,036 --> 00:07:00,780
fell down a flight of
stairs on a cruise ship

121
00:07:00,804 --> 00:07:02,087
before it left the dock.

122
00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:04,069
He has a couple of broken
ribs and we're waiting

123
00:07:04,107 --> 00:07:06,208
for the abdominal CT results.

124
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:09,227
- Where were you headed,
Mr. Stamm?
- Alaska.

125
00:07:09,329 --> 00:07:11,262
It... a present from my kids.

126
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:13,615
Maybe I'll meet a nice
lady, my daughter said.

127
00:07:13,717 --> 00:07:15,016
Now, look at me.

128
00:07:15,118 --> 00:07:17,552
I don't think he fell as
much as passed out.

129
00:07:18,588 --> 00:07:20,739
- That bad, doc?
- You have what's called

130
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:24,159
sick sinus syndrome. It's an irregular
heart rhythm that causes blackouts.

131
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:26,995
- We're gonna
have to do an ablation...
- Doctor...

132
00:07:28,098 --> 00:07:30,982
I think you might have
to check my head, too.

133
00:07:31,084 --> 00:07:33,300
- Does it still hurt?
- No, but...

134
00:07:34,504 --> 00:07:36,371
I think I'm seeing a ghost.

135
00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:39,607
- Betty?
- Yes?

136
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,242
It's Henry.

137
00:07:41,344 --> 00:07:43,044
Henry Stamm.

138
00:07:45,349 --> 00:07:47,615
Henry? Henry Stamm?

139
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:50,268
Oh, my God! That's Henry Stamm.

140
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:52,286
Betty Flynn!

141
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:54,639
But my last name is Donahue now.

142
00:07:54,741 --> 00:07:57,325
You married Mike Donahue?

143
00:07:57,427 --> 00:07:59,577
May he rest in peace.

144
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:03,214
And you? How... How is Irene?

145
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,750
She died ten years
ago this August.

146
00:08:05,835 --> 00:08:08,135
I'm so sorry.

147
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:10,889
- Are you OK?
- Just a little fall.

148
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:13,891
- You?
- Fender bender.

149
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:16,594
You look good, Betty.

150
00:08:16,697 --> 00:08:19,864
- I'm an old lady, Henry.
- - You look pretty damn good

151
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:22,400
- for an old lady to me.
- We should keep this area clear

152
00:08:22,503 --> 00:08:24,635
- for emergencies.
- We haven't seen each other

153
00:08:24,738 --> 00:08:27,521
- in a half a century, miss.
- All the more reason
for you to wait

154
00:08:27,623 --> 00:08:30,374
- a little longer
for your reunion.
- Yang.

155
00:08:30,476 --> 00:08:33,411
She'll be in room 3128.

156
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,413
Betty Flynn!

157
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,649
Oh, my God!

158
00:08:37,751 --> 00:08:39,401
Hello.

159
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:51,874
What song is that?
I know that song.

160
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:55,867
Oh... Just a little
something stuck in my head.

161
00:08:55,969 --> 00:08:57,201
You know how it is.

162
00:08:57,303 --> 00:09:01,055
Oh! You both have a great day.

163
00:09:04,427 --> 00:09:06,527
- Bailey in a good mood.
- She is.

164
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:10,114
- Really good.
- Teddy was right for you.

165
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:11,978
- Appropriate.
- Appropriate is boring.

166
00:09:12,002 --> 00:09:14,502
That sums up
your entire problem.

167
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:18,089
Good morning.

168
00:09:29,136 --> 00:09:30,568
Gentlemen.

169
00:09:32,306 --> 00:09:34,705
- Go, Bailey.
- Indeed.

170
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:39,260
I'm not crazy. I'm not crazy.

171
00:09:39,362 --> 00:09:42,297
It's OK, Haley. Honey, the
doctors are gonna help you.

172
00:09:42,398 --> 00:09:44,799
- You page Surgery?
- Hayley May, 16,

173
00:09:44,901 --> 00:09:48,553
diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic.
Tried to claw her eyes out.

174
00:09:48,655 --> 00:09:50,683
I need you to clear her before
I can take her up to Psych.

175
00:09:50,707 --> 00:09:53,808
- She tried to claw
her eyes out?
- We try to keep her safe.

176
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:55,410
She's on every med in the book.

177
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:56,855
But she doesn't
eat, doesn't sleep.

178
00:09:56,879 --> 00:09:59,563
The slightest thing sets
her off. Talking even.

179
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:02,317
So we're having her committed.
We explained to her that

180
00:10:02,418 --> 00:10:04,752
they were coming to
get her, to try and help.

181
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:08,372
We turned our back for a
minute, just for one minute...

182
00:10:10,794 --> 00:10:13,244
- Hayley...
- That's lorazepam.

183
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:15,814
- I swear to God, I'll do it.
- No, baby, please don't!

184
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:18,199
You don't believe
me. Nobody does.

185
00:10:18,301 --> 00:10:20,401
So no. I swear to
God I'll stab myself.

186
00:10:20,503 --> 00:10:22,487
Hayley, I'm Dr. Karev, Alex.

187
00:10:22,589 --> 00:10:25,507
- I need you to put that down.
- It will kill me, right?

188
00:10:25,609 --> 00:10:27,775
If I stuck this in my
heart, it would kill me?

189
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:29,371
You don't want
to do that, Hayley.

190
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:31,446
There's drugs in
here. I'd die, right?

191
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:33,748
Trust me.

192
00:10:35,018 --> 00:10:38,336
- I can help you.
- I'm not crazy.

193
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:40,505
I know.

194
00:10:40,607 --> 00:10:41,772
I believe you.

195
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:43,653
Everyone outside
thinks you're crazy,

196
00:10:43,677 --> 00:10:45,454
but something's going on inside

197
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,778
and none of us understand,

198
00:10:47,881 --> 00:10:49,914
so we need to
figure out what that is.

199
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:52,900
The only way we can do
that is if you put that down

200
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:55,303
and let me run some tests.

201
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:59,440
- OK?
- You promise?

202
00:11:01,677 --> 00:11:03,211
Yes.

203
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:10,785
Just... put it down.

204
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:14,272
It's gonna be OK.

205
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:25,083
Good. That's good.

206
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,837
I'm not crazy. I'm not crazy.

207
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,274
I'm not crazy. I'm not crazy.

208
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:35,477
Page Shepherd.

209
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:38,997
I'd like to run some
tests on Hayley.

210
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:42,133
More tests? We've
been to doctors, OK?

211
00:11:42,235 --> 00:11:43,634
Hayley is schizophrenic.

212
00:11:43,737 --> 00:11:45,503
She was diagnosed months ago.

213
00:11:45,605 --> 00:11:47,054
Ken's father was schizophrenic.

214
00:11:47,157 --> 00:11:49,257
He killed himself
when Ken was eight.

215
00:11:49,359 --> 00:11:52,793
Dr. Shepherd, it's just a few
more tests. She wants them.

216
00:11:52,895 --> 00:11:56,414
Mr. and Mrs. May, believe
me, I understand your frustration.

217
00:11:56,516 --> 00:11:59,417
But it's possible
something was missed.

218
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,219
Honey, please.

219
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:04,100
- Fine.
- OK.

220
00:12:04,124 --> 00:12:06,323
- OK. OK.
- Thank you.

221
00:12:06,426 --> 00:12:10,361
I wanna run an
EEG, a CAT scan...

222
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:16,083
Morning, Amber and Trish.

223
00:12:16,186 --> 00:12:18,286
Trish and Amber
met in the burn unit.

224
00:12:18,388 --> 00:12:20,171
Best friends ever since.

225
00:12:20,273 --> 00:12:22,206
- Dr. Grey?
- Amber Collier, 28,

226
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:26,894
presents status post MVC.
Amber was in a car when it flipped

227
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:29,197
and she was pinned
under it while it burned.

228
00:12:29,315 --> 00:12:31,355
Driving while texting.
We strongly recommend it.

229
00:12:31,401 --> 00:12:35,770
Dr. Avery, will you please explain
how we're gonna use a tissue expander.

230
00:12:35,872 --> 00:12:37,355
We stretch healthy tissue

231
00:12:37,457 --> 00:12:39,957
by injecting saline into a
balloon placed under the skull.

232
00:12:40,043 --> 00:12:41,704
Today we'll remove
that burned area

233
00:12:41,728 --> 00:12:44,128
- and cover it with new tissue.
- You promise that afterwards

234
00:12:44,164 --> 00:12:47,615
- it won't look like
a comb-over, right?
- I will do my best.

235
00:12:48,885 --> 00:12:51,652
Dr. Sloan, Dr. Bailey.

236
00:12:56,008 --> 00:12:57,987
Amber, how long have
your fingers looked like this?

237
00:12:58,011 --> 00:12:59,731
I don't know, they
always look pretty bad.

238
00:12:59,796 --> 00:13:03,097
- You can still
do my surgery, right?
- We'll know more

239
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:05,649
after we get some
films on the fingers.

240
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:09,420
You're bummed out about
getting a couple of x-rays?

241
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:12,357
You got a twin sister
growing out of your head.

242
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:14,575
That's what you should
be bummed about.

243
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:21,415
She was my wife's
roommate, her best friend.

244
00:13:21,517 --> 00:13:24,151
And you haven't seen
one another since then?

245
00:13:24,254 --> 00:13:26,721
She was supposed
to be in our wedding,

246
00:13:26,822 --> 00:13:29,423
my wife's maid of honor,

247
00:13:29,525 --> 00:13:31,992
but she disappeared.

248
00:13:32,094 --> 00:13:36,797
I figured that I would write
her eventually and try to explain.

249
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:39,951
But how do you say, "I
couldn't stand up in your wedding

250
00:13:40,053 --> 00:13:42,453
because I fell in love
with your fiancé?"

251
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:44,739
There was a party.

252
00:13:44,841 --> 00:13:49,427
I remember the sky
was so clear that night.

253
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:52,497
I went outside to
look at the stars.

254
00:13:52,599 --> 00:13:54,031
And there was Betty.

255
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:57,868
It just... happened.

256
00:13:59,372 --> 00:14:01,272
I felt terrible.

257
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:04,342
It was wonderful.

258
00:14:05,712 --> 00:14:07,212
He was my first.

259
00:14:07,314 --> 00:14:09,964
She was my first.

260
00:14:11,534 --> 00:14:14,435
Irene and I were waiting
for our wedding night.

261
00:14:14,537 --> 00:14:17,471
For the first time in
my life, I felt complete.

262
00:14:17,573 --> 00:14:21,458
Being with Henry,
I felt complete.

263
00:14:21,561 --> 00:14:23,561
<i>I wanted to tell Irene.</i>

264
00:14:23,663 --> 00:14:27,064
I wanted to call off
the engagement.

265
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:29,044
It would have been
a terrible scandal.

266
00:14:29,068 --> 00:14:32,970
And it would have ruined
my friendship with Irene.

267
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:35,406
But, of course, the
friendship was ruined anyway.

268
00:14:35,508 --> 00:14:37,008
She just left.

269
00:14:37,109 --> 00:14:40,745
She went to grad school
across the country. And...

270
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:43,348
And I...

271
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:45,816
I married Irene.

272
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:48,752
Well, I loved Irene.

273
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:51,905
But she wasn't...

274
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:54,658
She wasn't Betty.

275
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:58,262
I told myself there'd be
plenty of Henrys in my life.

276
00:14:58,364 --> 00:14:59,763
And were there?

277
00:14:59,865 --> 00:15:02,683
My husband was a good man.

278
00:15:02,785 --> 00:15:05,737
Kind, funny, smart.

279
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:07,822
But he was no Henry.

280
00:15:07,924 --> 00:15:10,858
There was never another Henry.

281
00:15:12,762 --> 00:15:14,962
Dr. Torres,

282
00:15:15,064 --> 00:15:16,381
I have an idea.

283
00:15:16,483 --> 00:15:20,300
Nearly 50 years later,
and still all those feelings.

284
00:15:21,237 --> 00:15:23,087
It's saying something, isn't it?

285
00:15:25,575 --> 00:15:28,692
Is that a good idea? He
just had a heart ablation.

286
00:15:28,794 --> 00:15:30,639
- He should be resting.
- A happy patient

287
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:33,664
- is a healthy patient, Yang.
- This scan shows
diaphragmatic rupture

288
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,677
from the fall. We have
to get him in the OR soon.

289
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:37,385
He can wait an hour.

290
00:15:39,322 --> 00:15:41,055
Let's let them catch up.

291
00:15:43,326 --> 00:15:45,960
- You're OK with this?
- I'm with Webber.

292
00:15:46,062 --> 00:15:48,779
I can't help it. I'm a romantic.

293
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:56,334
You think she's schizophrenic?

294
00:15:56,389 --> 00:15:58,534
I think she threatened to stab
a syringe into her own heart.

295
00:15:58,558 --> 00:16:01,692
- So I'm leaning
toward crazy, yeah.
- The scans are up.

296
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,422
Nothing in the frontal lobe.

297
00:16:03,446 --> 00:16:04,923
Or the temporo-parietal region.

298
00:16:04,947 --> 00:16:07,315
- Occipital lobe's clean too.
- Crap!

299
00:16:07,417 --> 00:16:09,900
- Told you. Crazy.
- We tried, Karev.

300
00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:12,637
All the tests are negative.
Let's go inform the parents

301
00:16:12,739 --> 00:16:16,307
- and turf her up to Psych.
- This isn't right. I know crazy.

302
00:16:16,409 --> 00:16:18,593
I grew up with
crazy, I dated crazy,

303
00:16:18,695 --> 00:16:20,535
and I don't think
this girl is crazy.

304
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:23,714
- Just give me some time.
- Do you have a diagnosis
in mind?

305
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:26,333
- No, but...
- She's suicidal, Alex.

306
00:16:26,436 --> 00:16:28,502
What you did in that
ER, you saved her life.

307
00:16:28,604 --> 00:16:30,115
But those parents
have been through hell.

308
00:16:30,139 --> 00:16:32,139
You say it's our job to
advocate for the patient.

309
00:16:32,207 --> 00:16:33,769
The patient, not the parents.

310
00:16:33,793 --> 00:16:35,671
So, whatever hell they've
gone through, hers is worse.

311
00:16:35,695 --> 00:16:39,113
I do say that.
Advocate for the patient.

312
00:16:39,215 --> 00:16:43,216
You've got until my board
meeting's over. Four hours. Go dig.

313
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:02,487
Alex...

314
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:04,939
- Are we a couple?
- What?

315
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,807
I need to know what we are.

316
00:17:06,909 --> 00:17:09,076
Because people ask me
and I don't know what to say.

317
00:17:09,178 --> 00:17:11,512
I'm over Mark. I don't
know if you're over Izzie,

318
00:17:11,614 --> 00:17:14,649
but I am over Mark
Sloan. For real.

319
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:18,119
And I know that we said
this wasn't gonna be a thing,

320
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,520
but I like you.

321
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:23,090
The point is, I want
to know what we are.

322
00:17:23,192 --> 00:17:25,376
What this is.

323
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:33,617
We're a thing.

324
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:37,054
Yeah, we're together,
we're... we're a thing.

325
00:17:38,825 --> 00:17:40,357
Whatever.

326
00:17:43,897 --> 00:17:46,057
Dr. Altman, can I do the
mesh repair of the diaphragm?

327
00:17:46,081 --> 00:17:48,415
No, I can sew it up
with a continuous suture.

328
00:17:48,517 --> 00:17:51,062
If you do stay sutures on
either side of the laceration,

329
00:17:51,086 --> 00:17:53,526
- it can be tented down
to aid closure.
- I know...

330
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:56,687
Quite a shorthand you two have.

331
00:17:56,759 --> 00:17:58,526
We worked together a long time.

332
00:17:58,628 --> 00:18:02,246
I get it. I had that
once. Ellis Grey, and I,

333
00:18:02,348 --> 00:18:04,799
from the first day
we worked together.

334
00:18:05,701 --> 00:18:07,017
I miss it.

335
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:14,241
She's got hyperacusis,
vertigo, tinnitus, nystagmus.

336
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:16,103
- This blows.
- So you and Lexie...

337
00:18:16,179 --> 00:18:18,206
- What?
- I'm just saying,
you and Lexie,

338
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:20,492
- it's not just
a sex thing any more?
- I'm acting like a duck.

339
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:22,761
- What?
- I figure if you
walk like a duck

340
00:18:22,785 --> 00:18:25,414
and quack like a duck, eventually
you start to feel like a duck.

341
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:27,071
Lexie is nice and
normal and healthy.

342
00:18:27,173 --> 00:18:29,818
I'm acting like a guy who can stick
with nice and normal and healthy.

343
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:33,260
- You're becoming a duck.
- I am becoming a duck.

344
00:18:41,387 --> 00:18:44,271
- Cristina, seriously?
- What's up with that?

345
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:47,608
She's mad at me because I planted seeds
of doubt about her moving in with Owen.

346
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:50,194
- Don't talk to him about me.
- Why don't you come over here

347
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:53,096
- so I can talk
to you about you.
- I'll talk to you

348
00:18:53,199 --> 00:18:56,250
when you actually talk.
Are you ready to talk?

349
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:01,088
I need the Lexopedia
to diagnose my patient.

350
00:19:01,207 --> 00:19:04,692
- She's not a book
you can flip through.
- I kinda am. Go.

351
00:19:04,794 --> 00:19:08,879
Sixteen year old with hyperacusis,
vertigo, tinnitus, nystagmus.

352
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,464
Cholesteatoma.

353
00:19:11,601 --> 00:19:13,000
Or temporal lobe tumor.

354
00:19:13,102 --> 00:19:15,102
For God's sake, will
you just come over here?

355
00:19:15,204 --> 00:19:17,104
- No.
- Scans were clean.

356
00:19:17,206 --> 00:19:19,423
Uh, it's worse with
sounds. We have to whisper.

357
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:24,578
Oh, uh... Page 162.
The June 2004 issue

358
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:27,314
of a journal with a
mint green cover. It's...

359
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:30,634
Sound or pressure induced
vertigo. It's called, um...

360
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:33,787
I can't... Crap. I can't see it.

361
00:19:33,889 --> 00:19:36,707
It's like the computer froze.

362
00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:40,077
June '04. Mint green cover.
It's in the research library.

363
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,496
Got it. Thanks.

364
00:19:44,834 --> 00:19:48,386
So Mark slept with
Reed. Gross, right?

365
00:19:48,488 --> 00:19:50,771
- But you're with Alex.
- I know.

366
00:19:50,873 --> 00:19:53,824
No, I'm just saying
it's gross. That's...

367
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:56,827
That's all. I'm
just... It's gross.

368
00:20:01,901 --> 00:20:04,735
Do you think I'm Thatcher? Is
that what you were trying to tell me?

369
00:20:04,837 --> 00:20:06,904
- That I'm Thatcher?
- What?

370
00:20:07,006 --> 00:20:09,757
Owen is Ellis and
Teddy's Dr. Webber

371
00:20:09,859 --> 00:20:11,737
and somehow I'm
Thatcher in the situation?

372
00:20:11,761 --> 00:20:14,128
I don't know. I don't know.

373
00:20:15,531 --> 00:20:17,031
Forget it.

374
00:20:29,946 --> 00:20:33,413
I don't understand.
You didn't find anything.

375
00:20:33,516 --> 00:20:35,716
I just feel like we're
torturing her for no reason.

376
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:38,319
OK, Hayley, we're
gonna start now.

377
00:20:38,421 --> 00:20:40,387
When I say now,

378
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:44,324
I want you to pinch
your nose and blow.

379
00:20:44,426 --> 00:20:47,895
Make sure you keep
your eyes open, OK?

380
00:20:52,468 --> 00:20:54,035
Now.

381
00:20:56,639 --> 00:20:59,406
What's happening to her
eyes? What's going on?

382
00:21:03,079 --> 00:21:04,711
No...

383
00:21:05,798 --> 00:21:07,565
No!

384
00:21:07,667 --> 00:21:09,416
No... No!

385
00:21:09,535 --> 00:21:11,485
No!

386
00:21:11,587 --> 00:21:15,306
Hayley, honey, it's
Mommy. I'm right here.

387
00:21:15,408 --> 00:21:16,990
What the hell did you do to her?

388
00:21:18,261 --> 00:21:20,361
I just diagnosed her.

389
00:21:22,865 --> 00:21:26,216
You don't have a
middle name? For real?

390
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:28,952
My parents couldn't agree
so they decided not to bother.

391
00:21:29,054 --> 00:21:31,638
Well, we're just gonna have
to do something about that.

392
00:21:32,775 --> 00:21:33,974
How about "Cheeky?"

393
00:21:36,812 --> 00:21:39,780
- Liz "Cheeky" McKee?
- Yeah. I like it.

394
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:42,416
It has spunk.

395
00:21:44,253 --> 00:21:46,587
All right. Take care.

396
00:21:49,358 --> 00:21:50,891
Miranda, that was...

397
00:21:52,294 --> 00:21:53,894
Miranda...

398
00:22:02,322 --> 00:22:04,638
You have to cut off
three of my fingers?

399
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,851
They're infected, Amber.

400
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:07,519
It also means we
have to postpone

401
00:22:07,543 --> 00:22:10,410
your hair
restoration. I'm sorry.

402
00:22:10,512 --> 00:22:13,197
Amber, you survived
a horrible car wreck.

403
00:22:13,299 --> 00:22:15,116
- You'll survive this, too.
- I know, but...

404
00:22:15,218 --> 00:22:16,934
Hey, what do we always say?

405
00:22:17,937 --> 00:22:20,754
We're both alive.
That's what matters.

406
00:22:20,856 --> 00:22:23,541
Everything else is
just bumps and bruises.

407
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:26,810
You can cry, Amber. It's fine.

408
00:22:26,913 --> 00:22:29,033
It's a lot to take
in all at once.

409
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:30,338
No, she needs to stay positive.

410
00:22:30,366 --> 00:22:32,010
That's how we get
through, we stay positive.

411
00:22:32,034 --> 00:22:34,601
She was excited. She was
hopeful. She was eager.

412
00:22:34,703 --> 00:22:36,237
And that has been crushed.

413
00:22:36,338 --> 00:22:38,672
She has the right to
have some feelings.

414
00:22:38,775 --> 00:22:40,441
She can be positive tomorrow.

415
00:22:41,227 --> 00:22:43,043
You can be positive tomorrow.

416
00:22:43,613 --> 00:22:45,396
Thank you.

417
00:22:48,467 --> 00:22:50,917
It's called superior canal
dehiscence syndrome.

418
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:53,587
It's a result of a small hole
that developed in her inner ear.

419
00:22:53,689 --> 00:22:55,339
It's rare and it's
hard to diagnose.

420
00:22:55,441 --> 00:22:58,025
The condition wasn't
even written up until 1998.

421
00:22:58,127 --> 00:23:00,010
The noise sensitivity,
the sandpaper,

422
00:23:00,112 --> 00:23:01,778
it's because Hayley
can hear everything

423
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:05,198
going on inside her body and
every sound outside was magnified.

424
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,817
It's why she
couldn't sleep or eat.

425
00:23:07,653 --> 00:23:09,203
She's not schizophrenic.

426
00:23:34,647 --> 00:23:38,015
Was the sex with
Altman, was it lousy?

427
00:23:38,117 --> 00:23:40,584
- Did she disappoint you?
- What?

428
00:23:40,686 --> 00:23:42,553
No!

429
00:23:42,655 --> 00:23:43,821
No.

430
00:23:43,923 --> 00:23:47,107
Is one woman never
enough for some men?

431
00:23:47,209 --> 00:23:48,575
I really want to know.

432
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:52,663
Because I think I'm a
good judge of character.

433
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:56,967
I am a good judge of character

434
00:23:57,069 --> 00:23:59,870
and I think Altman is a
good judge of character

435
00:23:59,972 --> 00:24:02,689
and then she trusted
you. She trusted you,

436
00:24:02,791 --> 00:24:04,441
and then you go...

437
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:07,544
I just want to know.

438
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,730
Teddy and I were
never exclusive.

439
00:24:13,269 --> 00:24:17,020
Were you and your guy exclusive?

440
00:24:18,024 --> 00:24:20,190
We're not talking about me.

441
00:24:24,213 --> 00:24:26,063
At the end of the trail,

442
00:24:26,165 --> 00:24:28,899
there's... there's an overlook.

443
00:24:29,001 --> 00:24:32,585
You can see the
entire bay from up there.

444
00:24:32,687 --> 00:24:36,056
Of course, the view
would be even nicer

445
00:24:36,175 --> 00:24:38,725
if I had someone
to share it with.

446
00:24:41,296 --> 00:24:43,597
Come live with me.

447
00:24:43,699 --> 00:24:46,499
- Henry...
- It's a nice place.

448
00:24:46,602 --> 00:24:50,770
- Warm, quiet.
- We barely know each other.

449
00:24:50,872 --> 00:24:52,923
We know each other.

450
00:24:53,025 --> 00:24:56,243
We missed our
chance once, Betty.

451
00:24:56,345 --> 00:24:59,095
I'd hate to make the
same mistake again.

452
00:24:59,197 --> 00:25:02,465
Betty, I need to get
you up to surgery.

453
00:25:02,568 --> 00:25:04,301
Think about it.

454
00:25:05,104 --> 00:25:07,771
That's all I ask.

455
00:25:11,644 --> 00:25:14,110
I got over you...

456
00:25:15,113 --> 00:25:17,130
Henry.

457
00:25:17,232 --> 00:25:19,210
I married Mike. I had four kids.

458
00:25:19,234 --> 00:25:23,220
Now, grandkids
that give me such joy.

459
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:27,591
I got over you.

460
00:25:28,977 --> 00:25:30,360
I'm sorry.

461
00:25:52,601 --> 00:25:56,320
Looks like that's just about it.

462
00:25:56,422 --> 00:25:59,556
You want to have
the anesthesiologist

463
00:25:59,658 --> 00:26:01,658
start lightening her up?

464
00:26:01,761 --> 00:26:04,527
- You could ask me directly.
- Dr. Sloan?

465
00:26:05,464 --> 00:26:07,914
You want to start
lightening her up?

466
00:26:13,889 --> 00:26:16,173
No, wait.

467
00:26:16,275 --> 00:26:18,558
I want to do the
hair restoration.

468
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,138
What about the
chance of infection?

469
00:26:20,162 --> 00:26:23,163
The infection
looked pretty isolated.

470
00:26:23,265 --> 00:26:26,082
- You think we can do it?
- It seems to me

471
00:26:26,184 --> 00:26:29,803
that we are all in need
of a little magic today.

472
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:32,823
Right, Dr. Bailey?

473
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:35,325
Let's do it.

474
00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:53,510
Do you think your mom
ever got over the chief?

475
00:26:57,683 --> 00:27:01,685
Do you think she still loved
him, after all those years?

476
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:04,971
My mom loved Richard
until the day she died.

477
00:27:09,678 --> 00:27:12,046
What were you trying
to tell me this morning?

478
00:27:12,148 --> 00:27:16,016
About Teddy and Owen. Is
there something I'm not seeing?

479
00:27:21,089 --> 00:27:22,634
- Cristina...
- Meredith, please,

480
00:27:22,658 --> 00:27:25,125
just tell me what
you know. Just...

481
00:27:26,328 --> 00:27:28,428
- Why?
- You have to understand.

482
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:30,797
It's been just me and
you for a long time.

483
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:34,334
And now it's me and
Derek, and it's you and me.

484
00:27:34,436 --> 00:27:37,170
And I told you what I said this
morning because it's you and me.

485
00:27:37,272 --> 00:27:39,773
But I can't tell you any more
because it's me and Derek.

486
00:27:39,875 --> 00:27:41,407
Fine, you know what? I get it.

487
00:27:41,509 --> 00:27:42,909
But I need you to understand

488
00:27:43,011 --> 00:27:46,263
that I need there to
be a me and Owen.

489
00:28:03,816 --> 00:28:06,650
- Hey.
- Hey.

490
00:28:06,752 --> 00:28:08,919
I hate your job.

491
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:11,070
- I love you.
- Stop trying to make me happy.

492
00:28:11,173 --> 00:28:13,790
Do you think he loves
her? Owen and Teddy?

493
00:28:13,892 --> 00:28:16,426
- I mean, do you think
that's why...
- Meredith.

494
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:18,040
I'm saying, when he
threw her under the bus,

495
00:28:18,064 --> 00:28:19,462
what read did you get?

496
00:28:19,565 --> 00:28:21,543
- Do you think he loves her?
- You can't tell Cristina.

497
00:28:21,567 --> 00:28:24,835
I know that. That's
why I hate your job.

498
00:28:26,322 --> 00:28:29,356
- Do you want a hug?
- Yeah.

499
00:28:32,744 --> 00:28:35,812
Wow, impressive technique.
Who taught you that?

500
00:28:35,914 --> 00:28:39,215
Mark. He taught
me one-handed ties,

501
00:28:39,317 --> 00:28:42,619
mattress stitches,
dual onlay bone grafts.

502
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:45,555
Now, he can teach
his techniques to Reed.

503
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:48,225
- Lexie...
- It's fine. I'm fine.

504
00:28:48,326 --> 00:28:50,744
I don't care. I'm with Alex.

505
00:28:50,846 --> 00:28:52,957
I do not care about Mark
and/or who he sleeps with.

506
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:56,466
That's the same thing I keep telling
myself about Arizona, that I don't care.

507
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:59,036
You know what? Sometimes
it works, for the most part.

508
00:28:59,138 --> 00:29:02,022
But then a patient gets asked
to move across the country

509
00:29:02,124 --> 00:29:04,608
for a man she barely
knows and all I can think

510
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:07,711
is how stupid they were to let
each other go in the first place.

511
00:29:09,915 --> 00:29:14,084
All I want is for her to
change her mind and say yes.

512
00:29:15,154 --> 00:29:16,319
I want to believe.

513
00:29:18,724 --> 00:29:20,501
OK, time to close off the canal.

514
00:29:20,525 --> 00:29:22,485
You're using fascia
and bone wax?

515
00:29:22,561 --> 00:29:26,074
Yep, then we'll cover it with the
cortical bone graft we harvested

516
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:29,299
and seal it with the fibrin
glue. She'll be good as new.

517
00:29:29,401 --> 00:29:33,786
You cover a hole with a bone graft
and this girl gets her whole life back.

518
00:29:33,888 --> 00:29:37,090
Wouldn't it be nice if everything
in life were that simple?

519
00:29:39,878 --> 00:29:42,712
I hoped it wouldn't
leave such a big scar.

520
00:29:42,814 --> 00:29:45,765
It'll look better in a couple of
weeks, once it has a chance to heal.

521
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:48,501
You'll be doing shampoo
commercials in no time.

522
00:29:48,604 --> 00:29:53,406
And your hand is just
bumps and bruises, right?

523
00:29:53,508 --> 00:29:55,943
I lost three fingers
today, Trish.

524
00:29:56,045 --> 00:29:58,945
- That's not bump and bruises.
- I know that.

525
00:30:00,315 --> 00:30:03,967
But we're alive. It's
better than the alternative.

526
00:30:06,505 --> 00:30:09,406
I call in sick to work sometimes

527
00:30:09,508 --> 00:30:11,786
because I just
can't bear to drive.

528
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:14,544
I sit in my car in my garage,

529
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:17,864
and I'm so angry about
what happened to me,

530
00:30:17,966 --> 00:30:21,101
that I can't drive my car!

531
00:30:21,203 --> 00:30:24,221
For hours, I just sit there!

532
00:30:24,323 --> 00:30:25,772
Does that ever happen to you?

533
00:30:25,874 --> 00:30:28,286
That you're so angry
you can't breathe?

534
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:31,078
Because I do! But
I can't tell you that

535
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:33,880
because I'm afraid
I'm being weak.

536
00:30:33,982 --> 00:30:37,050
Or ungrateful.

537
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:41,805
Please. You are my best friend.

538
00:30:41,907 --> 00:30:43,768
Horrible things
have happened to us.

539
00:30:43,792 --> 00:30:47,911
Can we just be real
with each other for once?

540
00:30:56,088 --> 00:30:59,089
I can't watch romantic
comedies anymore

541
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:02,792
because I just want
to yell at the women.

542
00:31:02,894 --> 00:31:06,930
"You can't find Mr. Right?
That's your biggest problem?

543
00:31:07,032 --> 00:31:10,934
Well, try having most of your
face burned off, you stupid bitch!

544
00:31:11,036 --> 00:31:14,187
See what a freaking
Pretty Woman you are then!"

545
00:31:18,777 --> 00:31:20,610
I don't know...

546
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:23,162
- Thank you.
- Oh, no!

547
00:31:30,489 --> 00:31:33,724
Cristina loves you.
And I want to, but I can't.

548
00:31:33,825 --> 00:31:35,503
Because I want to punch
you in the face right now.

549
00:31:35,527 --> 00:31:37,305
I know you tried
to have Teddy fired

550
00:31:37,329 --> 00:31:39,796
and I believe it's
because you love her.

551
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:43,833
And if you care about
Cristina at all, you will tell her.

552
00:31:43,936 --> 00:31:46,553
If you're actually the good
guy she thinks you are,

553
00:31:46,655 --> 00:31:48,121
you will tell her.

554
00:31:48,223 --> 00:31:50,157
And if you don't, then I'll know

555
00:31:50,258 --> 00:31:53,560
and you'll know that
you are not that guy.

556
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:10,427
Look, Teddy.

557
00:32:10,529 --> 00:32:13,530
- I wanted to say...
- I should've knocked. It's that simple.

558
00:32:13,632 --> 00:32:15,115
And it's that over.

559
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:21,149
- Talk to her.
- I just did. She doesn't want to.

560
00:32:21,173 --> 00:32:23,673
I'm not talking about Teddy,
I'm talking about Lexie.

561
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:25,692
You still love Lexie.

562
00:32:25,794 --> 00:32:27,644
Sleeping around
isn't gonna fix that.

563
00:32:27,746 --> 00:32:29,757
And the reasons you broke
up, Little Sloan, the baby,

564
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:32,482
they're not reasons anymore.

565
00:32:32,584 --> 00:32:35,068
- She's with Karev.
- Well, Betty married Mike,

566
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:38,872
- but she never got over Henry.
- What?

567
00:32:38,974 --> 00:32:41,557
You don't want 50 years
to go by and then realize

568
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:44,427
you let the love of your
life get away. So go, try.

569
00:32:45,814 --> 00:32:49,466
You gonna try
again with Robbins?

570
00:32:51,837 --> 00:32:53,436
Why not?

571
00:32:53,538 --> 00:32:56,005
Because my reasons
are still reasons.

572
00:33:03,114 --> 00:33:07,200
I don't understand. You told
Shepherd to hire Dr. Evans over Teddy,

573
00:33:07,302 --> 00:33:11,004
when I asked you to go to bat
for her? You said that you did. So...

574
00:33:15,394 --> 00:33:17,560
Meredith said...

575
00:33:20,815 --> 00:33:22,899
Owen, what's going on
between you and Teddy?

576
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:25,468
Nothing. Nothing is.

577
00:33:27,239 --> 00:33:31,041
You want me to get better,
I want me to get better,

578
00:33:31,143 --> 00:33:33,388
and I have been working. I
have been working with Dr. Wyatt

579
00:33:33,412 --> 00:33:38,014
- to eliminate my triggers.
- OK, so Teddy's a trigger?

580
00:33:38,116 --> 00:33:40,417
Teddy... I don't
know what Teddy is.

581
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:43,587
Teddy, she triggers
me. She confuses me.

582
00:33:43,689 --> 00:33:45,839
- I don't know!
- You know what, "I don't know,"

583
00:33:45,941 --> 00:33:47,218
is not working for me right now.

584
00:33:47,242 --> 00:33:49,687
"I don't know" is all I've got!

585
00:33:49,711 --> 00:33:52,695
- I shouldn't
have to explain myself.
- Oh?

586
00:33:53,181 --> 00:33:54,847
Cristina...

587
00:33:56,951 --> 00:34:00,186
I don't know what
I feel for Teddy.

588
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:04,710
I don't know, because she's all
wrapped up with everything else,

589
00:34:04,793 --> 00:34:07,627
with men being blown
apart in front of me, with Beth.

590
00:34:07,729 --> 00:34:10,530
So it's complicated and it
is screwing with my head.

591
00:34:10,632 --> 00:34:13,433
That's the truth! I don't
know what I feel for her.

592
00:34:13,535 --> 00:34:15,596
But I do know
what I feel for you.

593
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:18,871
So, yes, I told Shepherd
to hire the other guy.

594
00:34:18,973 --> 00:34:22,742
I shouldn't have to explain
myself so I can get myself better.

595
00:34:22,844 --> 00:34:24,964
I shouldn't have to
explain myself to you.

596
00:34:25,013 --> 00:34:29,733
And I damn well do not have to
explain myself to Meredith Grey!

597
00:34:40,395 --> 00:34:44,063
It's, uh... It's Henry Stamm.

598
00:34:50,371 --> 00:34:52,451
He was talking to me, and
then he couldn't breathe.

599
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:54,174
Atrial flutter again.
Get her out of here.

600
00:34:54,276 --> 00:34:56,492
- Ma'am, I need to move you.
- I'm not leaving him!

601
00:34:56,595 --> 00:34:58,578
Systolic's 80. We're
gonna need to cardiovert.

602
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:01,548
- Charge paddles to 100.
- Charging.

603
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:04,384
You wanna help?
Let go of his hand!

604
00:35:12,761 --> 00:35:14,143
Hello.

605
00:35:14,245 --> 00:35:16,124
Your heart rhythm
was irregular again.

606
00:35:16,148 --> 00:35:18,215
We were able to
control it for now,

607
00:35:18,317 --> 00:35:20,411
but we're gonna need
to insert a pacemaker

608
00:35:20,435 --> 00:35:22,630
before you go home.
You're gonna be OK.

609
00:35:22,654 --> 00:35:26,039
I've called a colleague
at your hospital at home.

610
00:35:26,141 --> 00:35:28,068
He'll see you once
we clear you to travel.

611
00:35:28,092 --> 00:35:29,342
Thank you.

612
00:35:31,029 --> 00:35:32,862
You stayed.

613
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:35,998
You can't do that again.

614
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:38,162
If I'm going to move
halfway across the country

615
00:35:38,186 --> 00:35:40,120
and shack up with you,

616
00:35:40,238 --> 00:35:44,273
- you can't do that again.
- Really?

617
00:35:45,677 --> 00:35:48,979
You make me feel like
the prettiest girl at the party.

618
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,781
When you look at me, I
become a young girl again.

619
00:35:51,883 --> 00:35:55,601
And I never stopped missing you.
And I never stopped wondering.

620
00:35:55,703 --> 00:35:57,570
I did the right thing once.

621
00:35:57,672 --> 00:36:02,208
Now, I'd like to do the wrong
thing and see how that goes.

622
00:36:04,796 --> 00:36:08,631
How long do you need
me to wait before I propose?

623
00:36:17,659 --> 00:36:19,759
- Cristina.
- Don't.

624
00:36:25,967 --> 00:36:27,784
She's starting to wake up.

625
00:36:27,886 --> 00:36:31,288
Remember, we're gonna take
it slowly and see how it goes.

626
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:34,491
There's no guarantee
that the surgery worked.

627
00:36:39,797 --> 00:36:41,631
How ya doing, Hayley?

628
00:36:43,101 --> 00:36:44,601
I'm good.

629
00:36:53,128 --> 00:36:54,377
I'm good.

630
00:36:59,517 --> 00:37:01,150
I'm good!

631
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:05,655
I'm good!

632
00:37:06,357 --> 00:37:08,825
I'm good!

633
00:37:08,927 --> 00:37:11,205
<i>Ask most people what
they want out of life,</i>

634
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:15,632
<i>and the answer's
simple: to be happy.</i>

635
00:37:18,237 --> 00:37:20,403
<i>Maybe it's this
expectation though,</i>

636
00:37:20,505 --> 00:37:22,839
<i>the wanting to be happy,</i>

637
00:37:22,941 --> 00:37:26,109
<i>that just keeps us
from ever getting there.</i>

638
00:37:26,211 --> 00:37:29,078
- I need to talk to you.
- I get it.

639
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:33,332
You want to see other
people. So go. Be free.

640
00:37:33,434 --> 00:37:35,751
Get cheeky with Liz.

641
00:37:35,853 --> 00:37:38,254
Liz is the meanest
nurse on the floor.

642
00:37:38,356 --> 00:37:40,201
She makes everybody in
my department's life hell.

643
00:37:40,225 --> 00:37:41,491
But she likes me.

644
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:44,110
She doesn't schedule me
for work on Tuesday mornings

645
00:37:44,212 --> 00:37:46,079
because she knows
that's when I play golf.

646
00:37:46,181 --> 00:37:48,159
She doesn't put me in the OR
with Hendricks 'cause she knows

647
00:37:48,183 --> 00:37:50,360
I can't stand the way he talks
to himself when he operates.

648
00:37:50,384 --> 00:37:54,370
And she does these favors
for me because I flirt with her.

649
00:37:54,473 --> 00:37:56,772
Flirting makes my job easier.

650
00:37:56,874 --> 00:37:59,375
And what you saw back
there, that middle name stuff,

651
00:37:59,478 --> 00:38:02,295
that's bad flirting.
Lazy flirting.

652
00:38:02,397 --> 00:38:05,798
For you, who I actually like,

653
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:07,617
I break out my good flirting,

654
00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:09,836
my A game,

655
00:38:09,937 --> 00:38:11,537
because I mean it.

656
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,257
Are you hearing me, Miranda?

657
00:38:14,359 --> 00:38:16,609
I mean it.

658
00:38:20,148 --> 00:38:22,215
I have a child

659
00:38:22,317 --> 00:38:24,250
and a fulltime job

660
00:38:24,352 --> 00:38:27,386
and I'm going through a sad,

661
00:38:27,488 --> 00:38:31,324
exhausting, stressful,
time-consuming divorce.

662
00:38:31,426 --> 00:38:33,727
I don't have time for games.

663
00:38:33,829 --> 00:38:37,030
- You understand that, right?
- I do.

664
00:38:37,132 --> 00:38:39,698
I do, and I'm not playing games.

665
00:38:40,535 --> 00:38:43,970
I'm in this for real. OK?

666
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:47,707
OK.

667
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:18,571
You were right. Superior
canal dehiscence syndrome.

668
00:39:18,673 --> 00:39:23,426
Page 162. You rock. I'm gonna drop these
off and we're gonna head over to Joe's.

669
00:39:25,463 --> 00:39:27,096
Lex?

670
00:39:31,302 --> 00:39:33,786
I'm still in love with you.

671
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:37,223
I tried not to be,
but it didn't work.

672
00:39:37,325 --> 00:39:39,341
And Sloan's gone.

673
00:39:40,712 --> 00:39:42,579
There's no baby.

674
00:39:42,681 --> 00:39:45,241
And I don't want
to sleep around.

675
00:39:46,367 --> 00:39:48,534
I want another chance.

676
00:39:50,739 --> 00:39:52,839
I'm in love with you.

677
00:39:55,576 --> 00:39:57,710
Karev is...

678
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:00,479
He's...

679
00:40:00,581 --> 00:40:02,982
Mark, I have a boyfriend.

680
00:40:03,084 --> 00:40:05,051
I know.

681
00:40:05,153 --> 00:40:08,071
I'm saying you could
have a husband.

682
00:40:09,808 --> 00:40:13,509
<i>Maybe the more we try and
will ourselves to states of bliss,</i>

683
00:40:13,611 --> 00:40:15,878
<i>the more confused we get.</i>

684
00:40:19,701 --> 00:40:22,501
- You ready?
- Yeah.

685
00:40:26,874 --> 00:40:29,775
<i>To the point where we
don't recognize ourselves.</i>

686
00:40:32,864 --> 00:40:35,315
- Hey.
- Hey.

687
00:40:44,642 --> 00:40:46,725
Arizona...

688
00:40:47,996 --> 00:40:50,429
<i>Instead, we just keep smiling.</i>

689
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:54,033
<i>Trying like hell to be the
happy people we wish we were.</i>

690
00:41:07,848 --> 00:41:10,049
<i>Until eventually it hits us.</i>

691
00:41:10,151 --> 00:41:12,151
<i>It's been there all along.</i>

692
00:41:12,253 --> 00:41:15,687
What do you think of this, putting in
the fireplace in the master bedroom?

693
00:41:24,415 --> 00:41:26,215
I'm gonna get something to eat.

694
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:35,274
Well...

695
00:41:36,561 --> 00:41:38,695
I'm not moving in with Owen.

696
00:41:47,772 --> 00:41:51,306
- See this, right here?
- Uh-huh.

697
00:41:51,409 --> 00:41:54,443
This is your room.

698
00:41:54,546 --> 00:41:57,130
You have a room at the
new house in the woods.

699
00:41:59,901 --> 00:42:02,268
My own room?

700
00:42:03,087 --> 00:42:06,939
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

701
00:42:11,813 --> 00:42:13,913
<i>Not in our dreams or hopes,</i>

702
00:42:14,015 --> 00:42:16,415
<i>but in the known,</i>

703
00:42:16,517 --> 00:42:18,851
<i>the comfortable...</i>

704
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:21,220
<i>the familiar.</i>
