1
00:00:06,389 --> 00:00:10,592
<i>Psychologists believe that
every aspect of our lives,</i>

2
00:00:10,694 --> 00:00:13,762
<i>all our thought processes
and behavior patterns,</i>

3
00:00:13,864 --> 00:00:16,965
<i>are the direct result of our
relationship to our parents.</i>

4
00:00:17,067 --> 00:00:18,934
You're looking all thoughtful.

5
00:00:21,022 --> 00:00:23,005
I'm just thinking
how pretty you are.

6
00:00:24,508 --> 00:00:27,158
And also how pretty
our children would be.

7
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:29,595
Children?

8
00:00:29,697 --> 00:00:32,798
- Like, multiple?
- Child.

9
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,200
Let's just start with
one and see how it goes.

10
00:00:35,302 --> 00:00:36,582
You wanna start?

11
00:00:37,337 --> 00:00:39,438
I'm just saying you're pretty.

12
00:00:40,724 --> 00:00:42,157
That's all I'm saying.

13
00:00:42,259 --> 00:00:44,270
<i>That every relationship
that we have</i>

14
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:45,760
<i>is really just another version</i>

15
00:00:45,863 --> 00:00:47,929
<i>of that first relationship.</i>

16
00:00:48,031 --> 00:00:49,865
Have you talked to Dr. Wyatt?

17
00:00:49,967 --> 00:00:54,369
- Cristina...
- When's the last time...?

18
00:00:56,423 --> 00:01:00,726
<i>It's just us trying over
and over again to get right.</i>

19
00:01:02,196 --> 00:01:03,862
- Alex?
- Mer?

20
00:01:03,964 --> 00:01:05,330
OK, so Izzie's not here

21
00:01:05,432 --> 00:01:06,876
and Cristina's not
answering her phone

22
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,001
and I have a thing, so I
need you to be a girl for me.

23
00:01:11,171 --> 00:01:13,021
What'd he do? You
want me to kick his ass?

24
00:01:13,123 --> 00:01:14,534
He wants me to have a baby.

25
00:01:14,558 --> 00:01:16,991
- So you do want me
to kick his ass?
- Alex.

26
00:01:17,093 --> 00:01:19,795
- Do you want to have a baby?
- A baby doesn't want me.

27
00:01:19,897 --> 00:01:21,274
I had the worst
mother in the world.

28
00:01:21,298 --> 00:01:23,982
I'd be the worst
mother in the world.

29
00:01:26,019 --> 00:01:28,937
Izzie wants a divorce.
She sent the papers.

30
00:01:29,039 --> 00:01:32,440
- The official papers.
- You want me to kick her ass?

31
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:36,228
Hey, Alex... Hey.

32
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:39,214
- He's being a girl for me.
- Dude, it's true.

33
00:01:39,316 --> 00:01:43,118
Right. There's a guy downstairs
who says he's your brother.

34
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:45,737
Do you want me to
send him to the bathroom,

35
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:47,917
since this seems to be where
you receive your visitors?

36
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:51,126
- Um, tell him to wait.
- Right.

37
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:54,229
- You have a brother?
- Yeah.

38
00:01:54,331 --> 00:01:57,448
- Do you want me
to go get rid of him?
- Crap!

39
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:59,450
What's he doing here?

40
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:02,303
Alex is the oldest, then
me, and then Amber.

41
00:02:02,405 --> 00:02:04,472
Amber's graduating
from St. Saviour's in May.

42
00:02:04,574 --> 00:02:07,091
She's... She's smart like Alex.

43
00:02:07,194 --> 00:02:09,005
She could go to
college if she wanted to,

44
00:02:09,029 --> 00:02:11,763
but she's, like, "What's
the point?" you know?

45
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:13,009
I don't know what to tell her.

46
00:02:13,033 --> 00:02:14,828
Alex is the doctor
in the family.

47
00:02:14,852 --> 00:02:17,552
- I move people for a living.
- Hey. What are you doing here?

48
00:02:17,654 --> 00:02:22,757
- Oh, man! You got old!
- Dude! What are you doing here?

49
00:02:22,859 --> 00:02:25,894
I had to drive to Portland on a job,
and since I was in the neighborhood...

50
00:02:26,013 --> 00:02:27,841
Portland's not in
the neighborhood.

51
00:02:27,865 --> 00:02:29,576
It's three hours. I do
three hours in my sleep.

52
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,651
Alex, he's your brother.
He's allowed to come say hi.

53
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:36,304
You're gonna be
late for pre-rounds.

54
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:40,459
OK. Well, it was very nice to
meet you. I'm Lexie, by the way.

55
00:02:40,561 --> 00:02:42,594
I'm overdue for a visit.
It's been seven years.

56
00:02:42,696 --> 00:02:45,013
- No, it has not.
- Since you've been home.

57
00:02:45,115 --> 00:02:47,675
- Seven years.
- You haven't been home
in seven years?

58
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:50,251
Derek. I have this.

59
00:02:50,353 --> 00:02:51,403
Mm-hmm.

60
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:53,271
- Derek. Nice meeting you.
- Aaron.

61
00:02:53,374 --> 00:02:56,141
- Take care. I'll see you.
- Meredith, by the way.

62
00:02:56,243 --> 00:02:58,026
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

63
00:02:59,663 --> 00:03:00,740
Has it been seven years?

64
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:02,714
Amber was ten last
time we saw you.

65
00:03:02,816 --> 00:03:04,811
What's going on?
What do you want?

66
00:03:04,835 --> 00:03:08,620
I do miss you, OK? And
I did want to say hi, but...

67
00:03:08,722 --> 00:03:12,407
since you're a doctor,
I thought I'd ask.

68
00:03:15,312 --> 00:03:17,579
Should I be worried about this?

69
00:03:27,424 --> 00:03:29,324
- Thank you. Cappuccino.
- Cappuccino.

70
00:03:29,426 --> 00:03:30,992
So? How'd the
date go with Teddy?

71
00:03:31,094 --> 00:03:33,494
I don't know if
I'd call it a date.

72
00:03:33,563 --> 00:03:36,598
Doesn't going on a date imply
actually going somewhere?

73
00:03:37,668 --> 00:03:39,834
Shut up. You had sex?

74
00:03:39,936 --> 00:03:42,086
- Hey, guys!
- Hey!

75
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:49,494
Oh! Pound cake.

76
00:03:49,597 --> 00:03:53,265
I love pound cake.
Rich, buttery pound cake.

77
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:54,790
- Mmm.
- Yum, pound cake.

78
00:03:56,503 --> 00:03:59,254
- Mmm. Mm-hmm.
- Hmm.

79
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:04,476
- Pound cake?
- Oh, I'm good. Thanks.

80
00:04:04,561 --> 00:04:08,296
So, what exactly
constitutes a pound cake?

81
00:04:08,398 --> 00:04:11,066
- It's a yellow cake.
- There you go.

82
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:13,234
- Kinda heavy.
- Come on.

83
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:16,255
Code for something dirty, right?
Like you eat her pound cake,

84
00:04:16,357 --> 00:04:19,023
- she eats your pound cake.
- No.

85
00:04:19,109 --> 00:04:21,726
Oh, please, tell me it's
dirty. Because otherwise,

86
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:24,562
that was the most boring
conversation I've ever been a part of.

87
00:04:24,665 --> 00:04:26,175
We are talking about pound cake

88
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:28,144
because I want a
kid and she doesn't.

89
00:04:28,168 --> 00:04:29,601
We're not talking about that.

90
00:04:29,703 --> 00:04:32,203
How long are you two not
gonna have that conversation?

91
00:04:32,306 --> 00:04:36,191
- A year? Two years? Five?
- Wow.

92
00:04:36,293 --> 00:04:39,027
So... you and Teddy
ate pound cake together?

93
00:04:39,129 --> 00:04:42,580
- You're changing the subject.
- You like how I did that?

94
00:04:42,683 --> 00:04:45,650
- So how was it?
- Mind-blowing.

95
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:47,272
- Yeah?
- I pounded her cake.

96
00:04:47,354 --> 00:04:48,886
She pounded mine.

97
00:04:48,988 --> 00:04:51,022
Excellent pound-caking.

98
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:54,626
- Pound-caking is not a thing.
- Whatever. I blew her mind.

99
00:04:54,728 --> 00:04:57,578
- Life-changing?
- Life-changing,
earth-shattering.

100
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,092
The point is, he's a
legend for a reason.

101
00:04:59,116 --> 00:05:02,684
He has skills that I never
even knew existed. It was like

102
00:05:02,786 --> 00:05:05,604
- there was a party going on.
- A party in your panties.

103
00:05:05,706 --> 00:05:07,672
Oh...

104
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:09,907
Morning.

105
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:11,893
- Good morning.
- Hi.

106
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:22,548
- Bye.
- Bye.

107
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:23,755
See you.

108
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:27,559
He's always so grumpy.

109
00:05:28,962 --> 00:05:31,596
He's going through something.
And Cristina doesn't get it.

110
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:35,266
She can't, which isn't her
fault. But I do get it, and...

111
00:05:35,369 --> 00:05:38,269
and I can't be there
for him, and that's...

112
00:05:39,573 --> 00:05:40,755
That's really hard.

113
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:43,875
But you're seeing Mark.

114
00:05:44,611 --> 00:05:46,661
But I'm seeing Mark.

115
00:05:49,699 --> 00:05:50,999
So then a couple days ago,

116
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:52,950
we're at the grocery
store, Gary and I.

117
00:05:53,053 --> 00:05:56,370
The next thing I know, I'm flat on
my back in the frozen food section.

118
00:05:56,472 --> 00:05:58,607
- She fainted.
- And I have never fainted.

119
00:05:58,709 --> 00:06:00,002
I've never even
seen anybody faint.

120
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:02,071
- I don't believe in fainting.
- Did you hit your head?

121
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:04,446
I would've if this one
hadn't caught me.

122
00:06:04,548 --> 00:06:06,982
Mrs. Clark is anemic
and guaiac positive,

123
00:06:07,084 --> 00:06:08,284
so there's internal bleeding,

124
00:06:08,385 --> 00:06:09,846
which looks like
it's coming from...

125
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,910
A friable tumor near
the ampulla of Vater.

126
00:06:11,971 --> 00:06:13,955
Yes, thank you
for that, Dr. Kepner.

127
00:06:14,057 --> 00:06:17,442
Dr. Swender told us the biopsy
showed the cancer was back,

128
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:19,444
but she said you might
be able to take it out.

129
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:22,213
There's a chance I won't be able
to go in as deeply as I need to.

130
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:25,083
But I'll promise to
do everything I can.

131
00:06:27,337 --> 00:06:30,905
- Anything you could do...
- We appreciate it, Dr. Webber.

132
00:06:31,741 --> 00:06:33,224
Thank you.

133
00:06:35,445 --> 00:06:37,078
Thank you.

134
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:45,987
- I honestly don't
think I need surgery.
- You do.

135
00:06:46,089 --> 00:06:48,490
- It doesn't hurt that bad.
- You have an umbilical hernia.

136
00:06:48,592 --> 00:06:51,158
You need surgery. Shut
up and fill out the paperwork.

137
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:52,500
Surgery'll make it hurt worse.

138
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:54,007
Remember when Dad
had his gallbladder out?

139
00:06:54,031 --> 00:06:56,430
- Stop talking and write!
- Write what?

140
00:06:56,533 --> 00:06:59,183
I don't have insurance.
What am I supposed to write?

141
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:02,887
- Ask Bailey to do it pro bono.
- I can't ask her to do that.

142
00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:06,157
- Alex, he's your brother.
- Evil spawn has a brother?

143
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:07,959
Aaron, Cristina Yang.

144
00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:10,344
Nice to meet you,
Dr. Yang. I'm Aaron Karev.

145
00:07:10,446 --> 00:07:12,966
Oh, my God, you're
so nice. He's so...

146
00:07:13,049 --> 00:07:16,017
Why can't you be nice like
your brother, angel spawn?

147
00:07:16,119 --> 00:07:18,453
- Why can't you?
- Fair enough.

148
00:07:18,555 --> 00:07:21,173
- Mer, what's up? You called?
- Ten times.

149
00:07:21,275 --> 00:07:24,075
Owen's still in his dark
place and he's still not talking.

150
00:07:24,178 --> 00:07:25,989
So I turned off my cell in
case he'd say something.

151
00:07:26,013 --> 00:07:28,146
Which he didn't. I hate
men. They're stupid.

152
00:07:28,231 --> 00:07:30,426
Derek asked me to have a
baby with him this morning.

153
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:33,034
Really stupid.

154
00:07:33,136 --> 00:07:37,505
Oh, great. The Pit, with
Owen and his dark place.

155
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:43,444
- What have we got?
- A cop with multiple GSWs.

156
00:07:43,547 --> 00:07:46,614
- How many cops did you say?
- Just one.

157
00:07:48,919 --> 00:07:51,986
Officer Gina Thompson, 34,
GSWs to the hip and chest.

158
00:07:52,088 --> 00:07:55,690
Vitals 100 over 70,
pulse 118, respirations 28.

159
00:07:55,792 --> 00:07:58,092
That's quite a police
escort, Officer Thompson.

160
00:07:58,194 --> 00:08:01,162
- I told those guys I was fine.
- I wonder why they
didn't believe you.

161
00:08:01,264 --> 00:08:03,431
- I've been in worse shape.
- Seriously?

162
00:08:03,533 --> 00:08:05,917
Oh, yeah. You should
see the other guys.

163
00:08:10,123 --> 00:08:11,889
You took down three
guys by yourself?

164
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,886
Hey, a girl's gotta do
what a girl's gotta do.

165
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,154
Am I right, ladies?

166
00:08:15,178 --> 00:08:17,362
- Coming through.
- Let's go.

167
00:08:21,468 --> 00:08:23,429
- How many
bullet wounds?
- Four. I'm wondering...

168
00:08:23,453 --> 00:08:25,682
- No exit wound for right leg.
- Busted the femur.

169
00:08:25,706 --> 00:08:27,299
- I have to debride.
- The trajectory...

170
00:08:27,323 --> 00:08:29,102
- Seems to have gone upwards.
- - Breath sounds are...

171
00:08:29,126 --> 00:08:31,304
Three chest wounds
can't be transthoracic...

172
00:08:31,328 --> 00:08:33,428
Oh, God, Gina. Baby.

173
00:08:34,497 --> 00:08:36,141
- Baby, look at you.
- I'm OK.

174
00:08:36,165 --> 00:08:39,184
They're taking good care of
me. This is my husband, Jimmy.

175
00:08:39,286 --> 00:08:40,526
This is Lieutenant Moore.

176
00:08:40,621 --> 00:08:41,781
What'd you find
out at the scene?

177
00:08:41,805 --> 00:08:43,432
You were told to
wait for backup.

178
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:45,668
I was first on the scene.
I heard a shot. I went in.

179
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:48,126
You disobeyed a direct order,
you endangered your own life

180
00:08:48,228 --> 00:08:50,690
- and everybody in the building.
- I took down three men
by myself.

181
00:08:50,714 --> 00:08:53,532
- And got yourself
suspended for it.
- What?!

182
00:08:53,634 --> 00:08:55,277
It's going to the review
board this afternoon.

183
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:57,046
You'll be lucky to have a
job by the end of the day.

184
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:58,920
- I gotta get out of here.
- I need you...

185
00:08:59,022 --> 00:09:01,556
- I gotta go defend myself!
- She's bleeding into her chest.

186
00:09:01,658 --> 00:09:04,003
- Throw in a chest tube now!
- Get them out of here now!

187
00:09:04,027 --> 00:09:06,428
- No, I gotta go! Please!
- Gina, just lie back.

188
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:09,158
- Go. You must go.
- All you
have to do is breathe.

189
00:09:09,182 --> 00:09:10,999
Dr. Webber, did you consider

190
00:09:11,101 --> 00:09:12,511
doing a Whipple on Mrs. Clark?

191
00:09:12,535 --> 00:09:15,369
I did. But since the
cancer came back,

192
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:17,255
I think I can do
a local resection

193
00:09:17,357 --> 00:09:20,659
and get the entire
visible tumor.

194
00:09:20,761 --> 00:09:23,327
- Dr. Kepner, are we boring you?
- No, sir.

195
00:09:23,413 --> 00:09:25,374
I just... I wasn't
expecting Chief Shepherd

196
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:28,833
to be up in the gallery
during a general surgery.

197
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:32,020
I guess that's the chief's job,
right? Evaluating, observing.

198
00:09:32,122 --> 00:09:36,357
Dr. Kepner, you're in my OR,
and the only one observing

199
00:09:36,459 --> 00:09:39,060
and evaluating
you right now is me.

200
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:41,482
Yes, sir. I'm sorry, sir.

201
00:09:54,444 --> 00:09:57,962
- Go get it, guys.
- Put the orange in the red.

202
00:09:58,064 --> 00:10:00,465
How's that? Orange and the red.

203
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:03,635
- And it's...
- Dr. Bailey, you got a second?

204
00:10:03,737 --> 00:10:05,303
I do. I have a second.

205
00:10:05,405 --> 00:10:07,338
Which is why I'm
spending it with my child.

206
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,791
Here, look. Say bye-bye,
Dr. Karev. Yeah, bye-bye.

207
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:19,967
- Say goodbye.
- Dr. Bailey,
my little brother is here

208
00:10:20,069 --> 00:10:22,754
with what looks like
an umbilical hernia.

209
00:10:22,856 --> 00:10:24,867
I didn't know Dr. Karev
had a little brother.

210
00:10:24,891 --> 00:10:27,269
Did you know Dr. Karev
had a little brother?

211
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,994
He has no money, he
doesn't have insurance. So...

212
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:31,874
Mommy sees where this is going.

213
00:10:31,898 --> 00:10:34,866
He'd have to have you
perform the surgery pro bono.

214
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:37,635
Did you hear that funny word?

215
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:39,937
Pro bono.

216
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:42,357
Mommy's got a mountain
of surgeries to schedule.

217
00:10:42,459 --> 00:10:44,959
Does she have time
to do free surgeries?

218
00:10:45,078 --> 00:10:48,078
And I'll schedule your
surgeries for the next...

219
00:10:48,181 --> 00:10:50,047
week if you want.

220
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:53,485
Think Mommy should fix up
Dr. Karev's brother, make him feel better?

221
00:10:53,587 --> 00:10:58,222
- Two weeks. A month.
- All right!

222
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:01,026
I will meet Dr. Karev's
brother in half an hour.

223
00:11:01,128 --> 00:11:05,563
- Say bye-bye,
Dr. Karev. Bye-bye.
- Come on.

224
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:08,866
I would have done it anyway,
but he just kept talking, didn't he?

225
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:10,268
You're so good.

226
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:13,387
<i>Dr. Sandoval to OR
three. Dr. Sandoval...</i>

227
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:16,124
- Mr. Clark?
- How is she?

228
00:11:16,226 --> 00:11:18,359
She did great in there.
She was a total trooper.

229
00:11:18,461 --> 00:11:21,262
The surgery went great.
We got the tumor, all of it,

230
00:11:21,364 --> 00:11:25,300
- with good margins.
- Oh, thank God! Oh.

231
00:11:25,402 --> 00:11:27,882
Dr. Grey, thank you.
Thank you so much.

232
00:11:27,954 --> 00:11:30,037
My wife keeps telling me...

233
00:11:30,139 --> 00:11:33,074
I need to be more
manly about all this.

234
00:11:33,176 --> 00:11:34,887
After all, she's the
one with the cancer.

235
00:11:34,911 --> 00:11:37,911
- She's afraid I won't make it.
- I think you're
doing just fine.

236
00:11:38,014 --> 00:11:40,309
- You both are. You like to see her?
- Can I?

237
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:42,450
She should be
waking up any minute.

238
00:11:42,552 --> 00:11:45,019
How is it your
brother is a surgeon,

239
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:47,538
and you waited months
to take care of this?

240
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,575
I don't know. Karevs are tough.

241
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:53,661
I guess five years in foster
care will do that to you.

242
00:11:53,763 --> 00:11:57,264
- Foster care?
- You're all foster children?

243
00:11:57,367 --> 00:12:01,235
Well, me and Amber were in
and out, but Alex, he had, like...

244
00:12:01,337 --> 00:12:04,338
17 different foster
homes in five years.

245
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:07,959
- So Alex was a foster child?
- - Yeah, because my mom was...

246
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:10,461
It was before they had all
the meds they have today,

247
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:14,123
and she was... I guess she was
doing her best, but my dad, he...

248
00:12:15,118 --> 00:12:18,002
wasn't a good guy and he was...

249
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:20,438
You know... whatever.

250
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:24,608
And so Alex, he got
shipped around a lot.

251
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:27,523
And he was a pretty rough
kid if you didn't know him.

252
00:12:27,547 --> 00:12:30,915
So people didn't like to keep
him. And he ended up in juvie.

253
00:12:31,017 --> 00:12:32,917
Juvenile detention?

254
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:36,187
Yeah, 'cause my mom, she'd...

255
00:12:36,289 --> 00:12:39,190
Sometimes, she'd
forget to buy food, so...

256
00:12:39,275 --> 00:12:41,370
He was good, though.
People wouldn't even know

257
00:12:41,394 --> 00:12:43,606
he was stealing anything if it
hadn't been for the video cameras.

258
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:44,863
How old was he?

259
00:12:44,965 --> 00:12:50,251
- Mmm... Eleven, maybe 12.
- Hey, what do we do with 2807?

260
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,520
- Dude, are you
talking crap in here?
- No.

261
00:12:57,544 --> 00:12:59,693
- Dude, I work here.
- So go to work.

262
00:12:59,795 --> 00:13:04,515
- Check the chest tube
in 2807. Go.
- Shut it, Aaron.

263
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:12,423
- So what happened after juvie?
- Dr. Bailey,
I don't think Alex...

264
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:15,059
Mind your business.
Aaron? After juvie?

265
00:13:15,144 --> 00:13:18,596
They couldn't just expect me to
just sit there with a 10-71 in progress.

266
00:13:18,698 --> 00:13:21,599
I had good, solid information
the perps were threatening...

267
00:13:21,701 --> 00:13:24,313
- Your doctors are here.
- We need to take you
to surgery.

268
00:13:24,337 --> 00:13:25,837
Kenny, did you get that? 10-71.

269
00:13:25,939 --> 00:13:27,504
Baby, he got that. You gotta go.

270
00:13:27,606 --> 00:13:30,542
Wait! This is important.
They're gonna need a statement.

271
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:32,855
Baby, that's what's important?
Trying to save your job?

272
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:36,147
- Jimmy...
- - Listen, every year you promise me

273
00:13:36,249 --> 00:13:40,768
that once you make detective,
we're gonna buy a house,

274
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:43,121
have a kid and
settle down. But...

275
00:13:43,223 --> 00:13:46,106
Baby, it's been seven years,

276
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:48,075
and every time you
get close to a promotion,

277
00:13:48,177 --> 00:13:50,010
- you go do something stupid.
- Baby...

278
00:13:50,113 --> 00:13:52,046
These people are
trying to save your life,

279
00:13:52,148 --> 00:13:54,482
and you want them to wait?

280
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:58,119
I'm not gonna stand
here and watch you die.

281
00:13:59,355 --> 00:14:02,090
I want a life with you,
baby. I want a long...

282
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:05,309
happy, boring life.

283
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:15,753
- Tell me everything you did.
- I was trying to wean her off

284
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,399
the ventilator,
but then I realized

285
00:14:17,423 --> 00:14:18,703
she wasn't breathing on her own,

286
00:14:18,758 --> 00:14:21,893
so I put her back on her
previous vent settings.

287
00:14:21,995 --> 00:14:25,296
- Dr. Webber,
what's happening to her?
- She may have stroked out.

288
00:14:26,566 --> 00:14:29,417
Get a CT and get the
scans to Shepherd.

289
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:32,420
Also, run an EEG. We
need to find out right away

290
00:14:32,522 --> 00:14:35,923
if there's any brain activity.
If there's not, then we need...

291
00:14:36,025 --> 00:14:40,327
She looks great. Oh, thank God!

292
00:14:40,429 --> 00:14:42,780
Dr. Grey told me
you got the tumor.

293
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:46,450
Thank you so much,
Dr. Webber. Can I wake her?

294
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:49,554
Sweetheart?

295
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:53,758
You still sleeping?

296
00:14:55,795 --> 00:14:58,329
The doctors said
you did great in there.

297
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:00,865
Honey?

298
00:15:01,801 --> 00:15:03,301
You awake?

299
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:07,338
Alison? Alison?

300
00:15:10,342 --> 00:15:13,844
The patient's had a massive
hemorrhage. Look. See here?

301
00:15:13,947 --> 00:15:15,880
The left temporal lobe.

302
00:15:15,982 --> 00:15:21,018
- Hemorrhages... looks like a...
- Wow. That bleed is huge.

303
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,989
- What?
- You look even prettier
in your scrubs.

304
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:27,224
What are you gonna do
about your giant stroke?

305
00:15:27,327 --> 00:15:28,125
Nothing.

306
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:29,761
- Nothing?
- Yeah.

307
00:15:29,863 --> 00:15:32,913
Mrs. Clark has a left temporal
lobe hemorrhage that's extended

308
00:15:33,016 --> 00:15:35,282
into the ventricular system.
There's nothing we can do.

309
00:15:35,385 --> 00:15:36,784
Want to get a cup of coffee?

310
00:15:36,886 --> 00:15:40,305
Only if you keep telling
me how pretty I am.

311
00:15:40,407 --> 00:15:43,558
We got three bowel injuries
here. You got anything, Avery?

312
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:45,716
- Found what did the damage.
- You see the bullet?

313
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,312
Lodged near the liver.

314
00:15:49,298 --> 00:15:51,732
Teddy, I'm looking
at a Devastator.

315
00:15:51,851 --> 00:15:54,301
- What? What does that mean?
- It means be careful.

316
00:15:54,403 --> 00:15:57,037
They're sharp like shrapnel
and explode on impact.

317
00:15:57,139 --> 00:15:59,640
Can you imagine
going to work every day

318
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:01,086
knowing you're gonna end
up on the wrong side of a gun?

319
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:03,243
I know. She is awesome.

320
00:16:03,345 --> 00:16:05,263
Now her husband
wants her to give it all up.

321
00:16:05,365 --> 00:16:07,714
He's all, "Start poppin' out
babies or I'm leaving you."

322
00:16:07,834 --> 00:16:09,461
Why does it have to
be one or the other?

323
00:16:09,485 --> 00:16:12,170
You don't want to have kids if
you're facing mortar fire every day.

324
00:16:12,255 --> 00:16:15,155
- It screws with your head.
- Is that why you don't
have them? Iraq?

325
00:16:15,257 --> 00:16:18,559
First, it was residency.
And then it was Iraq.

326
00:16:18,661 --> 00:16:21,312
And now it's... I don't know.

327
00:16:21,414 --> 00:16:24,082
- Waiting for the right guy?
- You want to have kids?

328
00:16:24,184 --> 00:16:26,783
- Wait, you don't?
- Have you met me? No.

329
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,774
OK, we're done here.

330
00:16:35,044 --> 00:16:36,855
- I think I feel it.
- Feel what?

331
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:39,013
The bullet. It's right
next to the heart.

332
00:16:39,115 --> 00:16:40,865
There's still some
bleeding. I got it.

333
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:42,361
No, no, don't...

334
00:16:42,385 --> 00:16:43,695
Oh, God!

335
00:16:43,719 --> 00:16:45,464
- Damn it, Cristina!
- What happened?

336
00:16:45,488 --> 00:16:46,916
You essentially fired a bullet

337
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:49,940
into that patient's
chest, is what you did.

338
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:55,689
- That's my intestine?
- Yeah. And that
part right there

339
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:58,366
is supposed to be on the inside
of the membrane, not the outside.

340
00:16:58,468 --> 00:17:00,033
Dude, that is sick.

341
00:17:00,136 --> 00:17:02,903
Can I get a copy of one of these?
I want to hang it on my fridge.

342
00:17:03,005 --> 00:17:04,883
Are we doing consults
at the desk nowadays?

343
00:17:04,907 --> 00:17:06,435
'Cause I kind of need
to use the computer.

344
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:10,011
Oh, uh, This is Alex's brother.
Aaron, this is Arizona Robbins.

345
00:17:10,113 --> 00:17:11,924
Nice to meet you. How come I
didn't meet you at the wedding?

346
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:15,299
- Actually, Dr. Robbins...
- That's right,
no one's family came.

347
00:17:15,402 --> 00:17:17,962
- Last minute switcheroo
and all that.
- What wedding?

348
00:17:17,987 --> 00:17:19,636
- Alex and Izzie's.
- No one's.

349
00:17:19,738 --> 00:17:21,439
Alex got married?

350
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:25,692
I'm just gonna go use the
computer over there. Bye!

351
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:28,128
He got married and
he didn't even call us?

352
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:31,550
No, it sounds weird, but it was
totally a spur-of-the-moment thing.

353
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:33,862
- You know,
because of the cancer.
- Alex has cancer?

354
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,703
- Lexie...
- No, Izzie has cancer.

355
00:17:35,805 --> 00:17:37,632
- Who's Izzie?
- Alex's wife.

356
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:40,508
But she's not really
his wife anymore.

357
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:42,654
It's... I wouldn't
worry about it.

358
00:17:42,678 --> 00:17:45,296
- They got divorced?
- No, but they...

359
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:47,197
She left, and then,

360
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,760
you know, she came
back, but he didn't think

361
00:17:48,784 --> 00:17:50,485
- it was the right thing...
- Lexie.

362
00:17:50,587 --> 00:17:52,837
- Stop talking.
- OK.

363
00:17:54,707 --> 00:17:56,919
- You guys all right up there?
- There's shrapnel everywhere.

364
00:17:56,943 --> 00:18:00,094
I was going for the bleeder. I
didn't touch the bullet. I don't know...

365
00:18:00,196 --> 00:18:03,847
When your commanding officer
tells you to stand down, stand down!

366
00:18:04,951 --> 00:18:06,166
I'm not in the Army,

367
00:18:06,268 --> 00:18:09,253
and you're not my
commanding officer.

368
00:18:09,355 --> 00:18:11,316
Dr. Altman and I
are your attendings.

369
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,941
And you are our subordinate,
and do exactly as we say,

370
00:18:14,043 --> 00:18:15,283
even if you do not agree.

371
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:17,189
You know why? Because
we know more than you do.

372
00:18:17,213 --> 00:18:20,714
For example, we know that Devastator
bullets have chemicals in them,

373
00:18:20,816 --> 00:18:22,661
and they do not
detonate on impact.

374
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:24,579
Sometimes, the
heat from that Bovie

375
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:26,070
is enough to make them explode.

376
00:18:26,172 --> 00:18:29,206
Do you understand?
Dr. Yang, do you understand?

377
00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:32,509
For whatever it's worth, I would've done
the same thing Yang did. Anybody would.

378
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,256
- If it's a bleeder...
- The damage is done.

379
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,732
There's no point in arguing
about it. Let's just fix it.

380
00:18:37,834 --> 00:18:40,234
Yang, I need your hands
right now. Right here.

381
00:18:40,336 --> 00:18:43,136
- OK, you see this? Hold it.
- Yes. Mm-hmm.

382
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:47,252
- Hey.
- Dude.

383
00:18:47,276 --> 00:18:50,361
How could you not have
told me you got married?

384
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:52,830
- You told him?
- No. It wasn't me.

385
00:18:52,932 --> 00:18:55,383
- Some of it was...
- It was Arizona Robbins,

386
00:18:55,484 --> 00:18:58,202
- and it was an accident.
- She figured your own brother

387
00:18:58,304 --> 00:19:00,165
would already know
you married somebody...

388
00:19:00,189 --> 00:19:02,117
This is why I didn't wanna tell
you. You'd make a big deal...

389
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:05,061
It is a big deal! You get married
on the spur of the moment,

390
00:19:05,111 --> 00:19:07,122
- you walk out on your wife...
- I did not walk out!

391
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,929
She walked out on
me. She walked out!

392
00:19:09,031 --> 00:19:11,476
You have any idea what Mom's
gonna do when she finds out?

393
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,852
- She's gonna go off her meds.
- She's not. You're
not gonna tell her.

394
00:19:14,954 --> 00:19:17,204
You're gonna get free
surgery, get back in your truck

395
00:19:17,306 --> 00:19:19,407
and you're gonna
get the hell out of here!

396
00:19:19,509 --> 00:19:23,110
Fine. You know what? I
don't need your free surgery.

397
00:19:23,212 --> 00:19:24,906
- I'll see you.
- Aaron, stop.

398
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:27,130
- You're not going anywhere.
- I don't need your crap!

399
00:19:27,216 --> 00:19:29,466
You walk out on us,
you walk out on your wife.

400
00:19:29,568 --> 00:19:31,269
Like father, like son.

401
00:19:31,371 --> 00:19:33,854
- Take it back! Take it back!
- Get off me, man!

402
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:39,910
Alex!

403
00:19:41,831 --> 00:19:44,048
- Get off me, man!
- Alex!

404
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:46,150
No, no! This is not
happening! Alex!

405
00:19:46,252 --> 00:19:48,085
- Get off me!
- Karev!

406
00:19:49,238 --> 00:19:51,272
- What the hell is your problem?
- You are!

407
00:19:51,374 --> 00:19:54,158
You hitting people now, too?
You really did turn into Dad!

408
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:56,894
Walk away. Alex, walk
away. Just walk away.

409
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:00,114
- OK...
- Give him some space.

410
00:20:00,215 --> 00:20:02,049
- OK, don't follow him.
- OK.

411
00:20:02,151 --> 00:20:04,951
I need a gurney. Run, honey!

412
00:20:05,071 --> 00:20:07,421
She could wake up, right?

413
00:20:07,523 --> 00:20:10,908
I mean, people wake up
from comas all the time.

414
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:14,312
I'm sorry. Your wife's
coma is irreversible.

415
00:20:14,414 --> 00:20:18,232
Dr. Grey, would you
explain it, please?

416
00:20:20,169 --> 00:20:23,688
Mrs. Clark's scans showed a
massive hemorrhage in her brain,

417
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:27,658
and the EEG showed
minimal brain activity.

418
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:31,929
But that means there's
hope, right? Because...

419
00:20:32,031 --> 00:20:33,514
At least there's activity.

420
00:20:33,616 --> 00:20:35,999
And... and her
heart's still beating.

421
00:20:36,102 --> 00:20:40,137
Only because the mechanical
ventilator is breathing for her.

422
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,888
When we turn the machine off,

423
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:44,052
the heart won't get
the oxygen it needs

424
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:46,243
- and it will stop.
- Why would you turn it off?

425
00:20:46,345 --> 00:20:48,529
People can live for
years on these machines.

426
00:20:48,631 --> 00:20:51,999
Mr. Clark, the advanced
directive your wife signed

427
00:20:52,101 --> 00:20:55,018
specifically requested
no mechanical ventilation.

428
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,998
She filled that form
out three years ago

429
00:20:57,022 --> 00:20:58,717
when the cancer
was first diagnosed.

430
00:20:58,741 --> 00:21:01,041
The doctor told her she
had six months to live,

431
00:21:01,143 --> 00:21:03,343
and she held on for
another three years.

432
00:21:04,213 --> 00:21:06,213
She'll come back from
this, too. You'll see.

433
00:21:06,315 --> 00:21:10,100
- You can't unplug her.
- - Legally, we don't have a choice, sir.

434
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:13,371
But... she's my wife.

435
00:21:13,473 --> 00:21:16,741
- It's my choice.
- It's your wife's choice.

436
00:21:17,644 --> 00:21:19,377
And she made it three years ago.

437
00:21:22,231 --> 00:21:24,098
You said the surgery went fine.

438
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,400
- That's what you said.
- It did.

439
00:21:26,502 --> 00:21:27,996
- But...
- No.

440
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:31,472
You're not a doctor, you're
a child! And you're useless!

441
00:21:31,574 --> 00:21:33,390
I'm done talking with you!

442
00:21:33,493 --> 00:21:35,671
I'm done talking
with all of you.

443
00:21:35,695 --> 00:21:38,011
Who's in charge here?

444
00:21:45,138 --> 00:21:47,271
He protected me my
whole life, you know?

445
00:21:47,373 --> 00:21:48,484
He kicked my dad's ass so hard,

446
00:21:48,508 --> 00:21:50,474
the son of a bitch
never came back.

447
00:21:52,177 --> 00:21:53,377
I thought he did that for me,

448
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:55,279
but maybe he likes
throwing punches.

449
00:21:55,381 --> 00:21:56,980
Aaron, I like you. I do.

450
00:21:57,082 --> 00:22:00,167
But you can't talk about
my friend that way, OK?

451
00:22:00,269 --> 00:22:03,087
I need you to count
backwards from ten for me, OK?

452
00:22:03,189 --> 00:22:06,423
OK. Ten.

453
00:22:06,525 --> 00:22:09,509
Nine. Eight...

454
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,679
That's it.

455
00:22:13,449 --> 00:22:15,849
A junkie dad, a crackpot mom,

456
00:22:15,951 --> 00:22:19,120
and somehow Karev
still became a doctor.

457
00:22:19,222 --> 00:22:22,156
I'm not easily impressed,
but I'm impressed.

458
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:24,809
- Prep him, we'll go scrub.
- Yes, doctor.

459
00:22:30,616 --> 00:22:34,752
Dr. Grey, we're meeting
Gary Clark in Shepherd's office.

460
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:37,537
- Five minutes.
- Yeah.

461
00:22:43,095 --> 00:22:47,531
I told a patient's
husband that she was fine.

462
00:22:47,633 --> 00:22:49,645
That her surgery went perfectly.

463
00:22:49,669 --> 00:22:51,685
And then next thing we
know, she has a stroke

464
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:54,438
and we're supposed
to just unplug her.

465
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:57,619
I know that I am
supposed to toughen up.

466
00:22:57,643 --> 00:23:02,346
I know that I am supposed
to not care, but how...

467
00:23:03,149 --> 00:23:04,848
How do you not care?

468
00:23:12,157 --> 00:23:14,608
It's the hardest
part of the job.

469
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:16,877
The very hardest part.

470
00:23:17,947 --> 00:23:20,280
How did you do it?

471
00:23:20,382 --> 00:23:21,966
How did you learn?

472
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:25,019
I'm still learning.

473
00:23:31,944 --> 00:23:34,144
Why is her BP still low? Is
she still bleeding up there?

474
00:23:34,213 --> 00:23:36,814
- We've got it under control.
- We've had LR and blood hanging

475
00:23:36,899 --> 00:23:39,077
since we got here, but we can't
catch up. Is her liver bleeding?

476
00:23:39,101 --> 00:23:41,619
- No, I think we got it.
- Dr. Torres is right.

477
00:23:41,721 --> 00:23:42,931
Still bleeding in
the retroperitoneum.

478
00:23:42,955 --> 00:23:44,482
We need a retractor in here.

479
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:46,752
That's a lot of blood. Get
in there with the suction.

480
00:23:46,776 --> 00:23:48,604
- See where it's coming from?
- I can't see past the clots.

481
00:23:48,628 --> 00:23:51,511
- The suction's clotting.
- Let's use our hands! Scoop!

482
00:23:51,613 --> 00:23:54,681
Did you check the uterine
artery? That could be the source.

483
00:23:54,783 --> 00:23:57,413
Down to 64 over 32. We gotta stop
this thing or we're gonna lose her.

484
00:23:57,437 --> 00:23:59,157
If we hadn't been
distracted by artillery,

485
00:23:59,205 --> 00:24:02,355
- we might have found this...
- Hunt, not now.

486
00:24:29,651 --> 00:24:33,420
That was, um... That
was our fault in there.

487
00:24:33,522 --> 00:24:35,033
We were speaking in shorthand.

488
00:24:35,057 --> 00:24:37,357
We forget sometimes
that you guys are civilians

489
00:24:37,459 --> 00:24:41,244
- and you don't know
about ballistics.
- It's not just that. It was...

490
00:24:43,065 --> 00:24:44,781
It's not the first time.

491
00:24:46,201 --> 00:24:48,001
He's been...

492
00:24:49,238 --> 00:24:50,771
It's been...

493
00:24:50,873 --> 00:24:53,056
He has been through so much.

494
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:55,075
It's not like he talks about it.

495
00:24:56,195 --> 00:24:57,927
He can't.

496
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:00,830
I can't talk about
it either most days.

497
00:25:00,932 --> 00:25:02,983
But Owen had it worse than me.

498
00:25:03,085 --> 00:25:04,951
Has it worse.

499
00:25:05,053 --> 00:25:07,093
He's triggered. Right
now, he's triggered.

500
00:25:07,189 --> 00:25:09,033
And his triggers
might never go away.

501
00:25:09,057 --> 00:25:10,707
They'll get better over time,

502
00:25:10,809 --> 00:25:12,654
if you give him time,
which you should,

503
00:25:12,678 --> 00:25:15,296
because he is in love with you.

504
00:25:15,398 --> 00:25:17,998
He just needs time.

505
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:21,034
He needs therapy. I keep
telling him to go to Dr. Wyatt...

506
00:25:21,136 --> 00:25:25,272
No, don't do that. He
won't go if you tell him to.

507
00:25:25,374 --> 00:25:28,391
He's... He's very...

508
00:25:28,493 --> 00:25:30,594
He's a guy that way. A man.

509
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:33,191
Don't ever tell him
what to do. Just...

510
00:25:33,215 --> 00:25:35,716
Just tell him how you feel.

511
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:45,709
When's the best
time to have kids?

512
00:25:47,813 --> 00:25:51,682
The best time to
have kids... is never.

513
00:25:53,185 --> 00:25:56,519
- What? You asked.
- Well, yeah, but...

514
00:25:56,622 --> 00:26:00,273
They cry all the time.
Nonstop. They never sleep.

515
00:26:00,375 --> 00:26:01,954
They're terrible
conversationalists.

516
00:26:01,978 --> 00:26:04,177
They take everything you've got.

517
00:26:04,279 --> 00:26:06,262
All your time, all your focus,

518
00:26:06,364 --> 00:26:08,465
all your patience,
all your sleep.

519
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:11,652
Everything, till you
got nothing left for you.

520
00:26:11,753 --> 00:26:13,187
Wow.

521
00:26:13,289 --> 00:26:16,506
But this morning...

522
00:26:16,608 --> 00:26:18,943
Little Tuck woke me up

523
00:26:19,045 --> 00:26:21,323
by putting his nose
up against mine.

524
00:26:21,347 --> 00:26:26,466
His cold, little nose.
And he goes, "Wake up!"

525
00:26:27,736 --> 00:26:29,431
And he got the "K"
sound in "wake."

526
00:26:29,455 --> 00:26:33,840
Wake up. See, up until today,
he'd say "D" instead of "K."

527
00:26:33,942 --> 00:26:35,709
"Wade up."

528
00:26:35,828 --> 00:26:40,931
Girl, him nailing
that "K" sound?

529
00:26:41,033 --> 00:26:42,382
It's the pride I felt.

530
00:26:42,484 --> 00:26:47,221
The irrational, unbridled joy.

531
00:26:48,324 --> 00:26:52,142
Yeah. It's at least as
good as any Whipple.

532
00:26:52,244 --> 00:26:54,773
Look, if you're waiting for
the perfect time to have kids,

533
00:26:54,797 --> 00:26:57,097
you're never going to have kids.

534
00:27:07,293 --> 00:27:08,592
Hey.

535
00:27:09,361 --> 00:27:11,328
Aaron's surgery went well.

536
00:27:12,431 --> 00:27:15,799
His hernia defect
was fairly large,

537
00:27:15,901 --> 00:27:19,035
but Bailey was able to
use mesh to bridge it.

538
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:20,637
So...

539
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:26,276
He'll be waking up in a few
minutes if you want to stop by.

540
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:38,221
Mr. Clark, I'm deeply
sorry for your... for your loss.

541
00:27:38,324 --> 00:27:42,626
No, don't speak about
my wife as if she's dead.

542
00:27:42,728 --> 00:27:45,629
She's still here.
She could wake up.

543
00:27:47,867 --> 00:27:49,950
She's not gonna
wake up, Mr. Clark.

544
00:27:50,052 --> 00:27:52,452
Not with the brain
damage she's suffered.

545
00:27:52,554 --> 00:27:55,472
- You don't know that.
- Mr. Clark, if we don't obey

546
00:27:55,574 --> 00:27:57,894
your wife's directive, if
we ignore her wishes...

547
00:27:57,943 --> 00:27:59,587
She signed that
form three years ago.

548
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:02,195
Her health will deteriorate.
She'll lose body mass.

549
00:28:02,297 --> 00:28:03,530
She'll have no immune system.

550
00:28:03,632 --> 00:28:06,333
She'll require
around-the-clock care,

551
00:28:06,435 --> 00:28:09,119
and that can become
very expensive very quickly.

552
00:28:09,221 --> 00:28:10,954
I don't care about that.

553
00:28:11,056 --> 00:28:13,440
It'll be no life
for either of you.

554
00:28:13,542 --> 00:28:16,443
And that's why your wife
signed the advanced directive.

555
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:20,147
She didn't want to have
to live her life this way.

556
00:28:20,249 --> 00:28:22,332
And she didn't want
you to live this way.

557
00:28:22,434 --> 00:28:24,801
Don't you speak for my wife.

558
00:28:25,871 --> 00:28:28,422
Don't you dare
speak for my wife.

559
00:28:28,523 --> 00:28:32,509
I'm sorry, Mr. Clark, but the ethics
committee has reviewed your case.

560
00:28:32,611 --> 00:28:34,694
We are bound by law

561
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:37,897
to obey her wishes.

562
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,100
If you unplug my wife...

563
00:28:41,703 --> 00:28:43,720
you'll be killing her.

564
00:28:47,977 --> 00:28:49,959
I'm sorry.

565
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:55,715
You should take all the time
you need to call your family,

566
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:57,550
to say goodbye.

567
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,937
There's no one to call.

568
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:02,239
We didn't have any family.

569
00:29:02,975 --> 00:29:04,942
It's just us.

570
00:29:06,178 --> 00:29:08,412
We didn't have any kids.

571
00:29:11,283 --> 00:29:12,899
It's just me.

572
00:29:37,276 --> 00:29:39,309
He's my sister's husband.

573
00:29:39,411 --> 00:29:41,278
- Excuse me?
- Don't play stupid.

574
00:29:41,379 --> 00:29:43,764
I'm not playing
stupid! I am stupid!

575
00:29:43,866 --> 00:29:48,718
I'm stupid and I'm humiliated.
And I'm sorry. I just...

576
00:29:48,821 --> 00:29:50,737
I've never felt anything...

577
00:29:50,839 --> 00:29:53,640
I've never felt
like this before.

578
00:29:53,742 --> 00:29:56,120
So if you just please
forget what you saw,

579
00:29:56,144 --> 00:29:58,223
because I promise you
will never see it again,

580
00:29:58,247 --> 00:30:01,431
and we can just go
back to being doctors.

581
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,200
Please.

582
00:30:04,753 --> 00:30:07,354
This day sucks. I hate this day.

583
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:09,355
Oh, God.

584
00:30:20,986 --> 00:30:23,253
You don't have to
be here. You can go.

585
00:30:23,355 --> 00:30:27,841
I'm just making sure you don't
croak, and then I'm outta here.

586
00:30:29,995 --> 00:30:33,380
You saved my ass every
day when we were kids.

587
00:30:33,482 --> 00:30:37,717
You... You were a better parent
than Mom and Dad put together.

588
00:30:41,056 --> 00:30:43,156
And every day, I
feel bad for Amber,

589
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:46,009
that she has just
me instead of you.

590
00:30:47,463 --> 00:30:50,180
What happened to you, man?

591
00:30:50,282 --> 00:30:54,718
I send you money every
month. I send Mom her meds.

592
00:30:59,358 --> 00:31:00,873
You want that to stop?

593
00:31:02,995 --> 00:31:06,296
I am this close to
being a real surgeon.

594
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:08,198
I can't...

595
00:31:09,634 --> 00:31:13,036
I can't be in that and do this.

596
00:31:14,005 --> 00:31:15,822
I can't.

597
00:31:21,029 --> 00:31:22,913
Amber's a good kid.

598
00:31:24,183 --> 00:31:27,016
She turned out
OK. You'd like her.

599
00:31:29,788 --> 00:31:33,156
You turned out OK, too, Aaron.

600
00:31:36,128 --> 00:31:37,894
I'm sorry your wife left you.

601
00:31:37,996 --> 00:31:41,431
Or... got cancer or whatever.

602
00:31:44,469 --> 00:31:45,802
Thanks.

603
00:31:53,945 --> 00:31:57,130
We repaired the damage
to your liver and intestine,

604
00:31:57,232 --> 00:32:01,100
cleaned out your fractured
hip and fixed your lung.

605
00:32:01,203 --> 00:32:04,438
There was a bullet and
some shrapnel near your heart.

606
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:06,239
- Oh, my God.
- But Dr. Altman was able

607
00:32:06,342 --> 00:32:10,009
- to repair all the damage.
- Thank you.

608
00:32:10,111 --> 00:32:13,913
Thank you all so much. Honestly,
I don't even know what to say.

609
00:32:15,484 --> 00:32:17,450
There was, um...

610
00:32:17,552 --> 00:32:19,753
There were complications, Gina.

611
00:32:19,855 --> 00:32:22,655
There was a lot of
bleeding in the abdomen.

612
00:32:22,758 --> 00:32:25,759
The uterine artery was involved.

613
00:32:26,928 --> 00:32:29,095
We were able to
stop the bleed, but...

614
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:33,400
in order to do
that, we had to...

615
00:32:33,502 --> 00:32:35,218
remove your uterus.

616
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:37,771
What?

617
00:32:41,493 --> 00:32:45,378
We had to perform a
hysterectomy. I'm sorry.

618
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:48,565
She can't...? We
can't have kids?

619
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:57,240
I'm so sorry.

620
00:32:59,077 --> 00:33:00,944
We can never have kids?

621
00:33:04,365 --> 00:33:06,850
- Oh, God.
- It's OK.

622
00:33:06,952 --> 00:33:10,069
- It's all right, baby.
- It's OK.

623
00:33:11,089 --> 00:33:14,157
It's OK. It's OK.

624
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:31,874
- How long has he been there?
- - About three hours.

625
00:33:32,661 --> 00:33:34,360
It's time.

626
00:33:35,931 --> 00:33:37,564
See it through.

627
00:33:51,946 --> 00:33:55,449
- Mr. Clark?
- Please.

628
00:34:03,675 --> 00:34:05,608
I'm sorry.

629
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:13,399
I keep telling myself there's
a chance she'll wake up.

630
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:19,039
Once you turn
off the respirator...

631
00:34:19,141 --> 00:34:21,908
there is a chance...

632
00:34:24,763 --> 00:34:27,730
even... even if it's just

633
00:34:27,832 --> 00:34:30,467
a less than one percent chance,

634
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:33,036
that she'll start
breathing again.

635
00:34:33,439 --> 00:34:34,771
Right?

636
00:34:35,557 --> 00:34:37,640
Miracles do happen.

637
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:40,743
That's what... That's
what she always says.

638
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:46,065
Please.

639
00:34:47,035 --> 00:34:49,535
Please, darling, wake up.

640
00:34:50,271 --> 00:34:54,007
- Please.
- I am so sorry.

641
00:34:59,948 --> 00:35:05,685
Please. Please.
Please. Please wake up.

642
00:35:05,787 --> 00:35:07,587
Please wake up.

643
00:35:08,957 --> 00:35:10,957
Please wake up.

644
00:35:11,693 --> 00:35:13,626
Please wake up.

645
00:35:33,365 --> 00:35:34,797
Hi.

646
00:35:36,234 --> 00:35:38,435
Were you checking up on
me in that surgery today?

647
00:35:38,536 --> 00:35:41,537
I wasn't checking up
on you. I was observing.

648
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:44,357
You know, that's the closest
I get to an OR these days?

649
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:47,493
I'm gonna choose
to believe you on that.

650
00:35:48,597 --> 00:35:49,813
Hm.

651
00:35:51,082 --> 00:35:53,432
They were married 32 years.

652
00:35:54,602 --> 00:35:57,042
There was nothing
you could've done.

653
00:35:58,190 --> 00:36:01,658
I'm going home to my wife.
You should do the same thing.

654
00:36:07,399 --> 00:36:10,650
Looking good, Gina. You're gonna
be back on the beat in no time.

655
00:36:11,687 --> 00:36:13,736
That's what they call
it, right? The beat?

656
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:16,206
Yes, they do. And no, she won't.

657
00:36:16,308 --> 00:36:18,241
Jimmy and I talked
about it. I'm quitting.

658
00:36:18,343 --> 00:36:19,720
- What?
- Why?

659
00:36:19,744 --> 00:36:22,778
Well, 'cause Jimmy's right.
I mean, it's a job, you know?

660
00:36:22,881 --> 00:36:26,165
And I love it. But I
love my husband, too.

661
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:29,285
And we're gonna adopt ten
Haitian orphans or something.

662
00:36:29,387 --> 00:36:32,005
- Eight.
- - Well, congratulations.

663
00:36:32,107 --> 00:36:35,508
- Thank you.
- Gina.

664
00:36:35,627 --> 00:36:38,478
I want you to know I did the
best I could with the review board.

665
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:42,165
- Josh, it's OK.
- They want you back on the job.

666
00:36:43,985 --> 00:36:45,184
Are you kidding me?

667
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:47,454
Welcome back, Officer Thompson.

668
00:36:47,555 --> 00:36:49,822
- Oh, my God!
- Look out now! Watch out!

669
00:36:49,924 --> 00:36:51,023
Oh, my God!

670
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:54,560
- Oh, my God!
- You're killing it, Gina!

671
00:36:54,662 --> 00:36:57,046
Thank you so much.

672
00:37:12,981 --> 00:37:15,431
- Where's Aaron?
- He went back to Iowa.

673
00:37:15,533 --> 00:37:17,984
You let him drive after surgery?

674
00:37:18,086 --> 00:37:20,703
I'm not his dad.
He's got my number.

675
00:37:22,641 --> 00:37:25,052
You know, you're nothing
like your father, right?

676
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:28,078
You're nothing like your mother.

677
00:37:33,184 --> 00:37:37,853
You're good. You'd be
good. You'd be a good mom.

678
00:37:39,324 --> 00:37:41,891
<i>It's the most important
job in the world.</i>

679
00:37:43,411 --> 00:37:46,746
<i>You probably should
need a license to do it,</i>

680
00:37:46,848 --> 00:37:50,016
<i>but then most of us wouldn't
even pass the written exam.</i>

681
00:37:58,492 --> 00:38:00,526
You ever wonder if
moisturizer really works?

682
00:38:00,628 --> 00:38:02,262
I mean, what's in this stuff?

683
00:38:02,364 --> 00:38:04,608
I'm a doctor and I haven't
even heard of half of it.

684
00:38:04,632 --> 00:38:07,900
Dimethicone? No idea.

685
00:38:08,002 --> 00:38:10,820
Distearyldi... Hmm.

686
00:38:10,922 --> 00:38:13,773
I can't even
pronounce that, so...

687
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:15,090
I want to have a baby.

688
00:38:18,062 --> 00:38:21,081
And I can't talk about lotion
or pound cake or anything else

689
00:38:21,183 --> 00:38:23,983
because you don't want
to have a baby and I do.

690
00:38:28,105 --> 00:38:29,939
So...

691
00:38:31,509 --> 00:38:33,293
we're gonna talk about it.

692
00:38:33,828 --> 00:38:35,294
Yeah.

693
00:38:36,364 --> 00:38:38,364
We are gonna talk about it.

694
00:38:39,885 --> 00:38:41,685
<i>Some people are naturals.</i>

695
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:43,720
<i>They were born to do it.</i>

696
00:38:43,822 --> 00:38:46,222
<i>Some have other gifts.</i>

697
00:38:47,959 --> 00:38:51,477
- Oh, you're making dinner.
- It's just pasta.

698
00:38:54,649 --> 00:38:58,300
Smells good. Are
you baking bread?

699
00:39:01,038 --> 00:39:02,372
So...

700
00:39:03,574 --> 00:39:05,825
You said you don't
want to have kids.

701
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:10,112
What?

702
00:39:11,983 --> 00:39:14,551
- Your sausages are burning.
- They're fine.

703
00:39:14,653 --> 00:39:17,587
- No, they're burning.
- Listen. They're fine. They're...

704
00:39:19,458 --> 00:39:20,790
Damn it!

705
00:39:23,962 --> 00:39:25,761
I'm sorry.

706
00:39:31,703 --> 00:39:33,436
Are you scared of me?

707
00:39:42,997 --> 00:39:45,164
I don't want to be.

708
00:39:52,757 --> 00:39:54,924
I have to go back to Dr. Wyatt.

709
00:40:02,850 --> 00:40:05,551
It's OK. It's OK. It's OK.

710
00:40:09,791 --> 00:40:11,791
<i>But the good news is,</i>

711
00:40:11,893 --> 00:40:14,477
<i>biology dictates you
don't have to do it alone.</i>

712
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:17,096
- Hey.
- Hey.

713
00:40:21,236 --> 00:40:23,369
I don't want you to be alone.

714
00:40:25,006 --> 00:40:27,507
If anything should
happen to me...

715
00:40:29,077 --> 00:40:32,645
I don't want it to just be you.

716
00:40:34,182 --> 00:40:37,349
Well, we would
make pretty babies.

717
00:40:37,469 --> 00:40:41,654
- So you're thinking about it.
- Oh, I'm thinking about it.

718
00:40:41,756 --> 00:40:44,224
<i>You can waste your
whole life wondering,</i>

719
00:40:44,326 --> 00:40:47,327
<i>but the only way to find out
what kind of parent you'd be</i>

720
00:40:47,429 --> 00:40:50,563
<i>is to finally stop
talking about it...</i>

721
00:40:50,665 --> 00:40:52,510
But we're not making
babies right now.

722
00:40:52,534 --> 00:40:56,202
We're practicing. It's
very important to practice.

723
00:40:57,739 --> 00:41:00,372
<i>And just do it.</i>

724
00:41:06,014 --> 00:41:08,081
You taste good.

725
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:13,052
You have no idea
how good you taste.

726
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:19,926
Mark, I... Oh...
I'm really, really

727
00:41:20,028 --> 00:41:24,764
enjoying myself with you.
I am. But I need to, um...

728
00:41:26,434 --> 00:41:28,813
I need to be honest
about something.

729
00:41:28,837 --> 00:41:32,271
No, you don't, if you're
honestly enjoying yourself.

730
00:41:32,373 --> 00:41:35,674
I... I am. I am.

731
00:41:35,777 --> 00:41:39,946
Then right now, that's as
honest as you have to be.

732
00:41:40,048 --> 00:41:44,083
- OK.
- Now, turn over.

733
00:41:44,185 --> 00:41:47,220
I wanna try a little milk
chocolate on your belly button.

734
00:41:59,401 --> 00:42:00,833
Ignore it. They'll go away.

735
00:42:04,371 --> 00:42:06,439
I'll get rid of them.

736
00:42:08,826 --> 00:42:10,459
Sloan.

737
00:42:10,562 --> 00:42:12,612
The baby's coming! The
baby's coming right now!

738
00:42:12,714 --> 00:42:15,114
The baby's coming!

739
00:42:15,216 --> 00:42:17,267
Oh, the baby's coming!
