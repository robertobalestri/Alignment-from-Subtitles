1
00:00:02,203 --> 00:00:03,480
<i>We're doctors.</i>

2
00:00:03,504 --> 00:00:05,770
<i>We're trained to care
for human beings.</i>

3
00:00:05,873 --> 00:00:08,307
<i>And we're pretty sure
we know what to look for.</i>

4
00:00:08,409 --> 00:00:10,758
No, it doesn't make any sense!

5
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:14,412
Everybody wants a kid! You
wear roller skates for shoes!

6
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:16,731
- I don't get it!
- You know what? I don't know!

7
00:00:16,834 --> 00:00:19,551
Maybe there's something
wrong with me. It's not natural.

8
00:00:19,653 --> 00:00:21,714
It's not womanly. Maybe I'm
cold and heartless and dead inside.

9
00:00:21,738 --> 00:00:25,039
- No, I'm not saying that!
- Well, but a little bit,
you are.

10
00:00:25,142 --> 00:00:27,175
- No.
<i>- Cuts...</i>

11
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:28,844
- OK.
- <i>infection...</i>

12
00:00:28,946 --> 00:00:31,146
<i>genetic mutation...</i>

13
00:00:32,199 --> 00:00:34,866
You know what? Just...

14
00:00:34,968 --> 00:00:37,288
Just humor me for
one minute, OK?

15
00:00:37,321 --> 00:00:39,955
Close your eyes.

16
00:00:40,056 --> 00:00:41,857
Close your eyes.

17
00:00:43,861 --> 00:00:45,611
Now, picture a baby.

18
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:48,530
A warm...

19
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:53,085
smushy little... baby.

20
00:00:53,187 --> 00:00:57,622
Wrapping its chubby little
arms around your neck.

21
00:00:57,724 --> 00:01:00,142
Now, breathe in that...

22
00:01:00,244 --> 00:01:02,894
that intoxicating baby smell.

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,017
Doesn't it just melt you?

24
00:01:10,554 --> 00:01:13,187
No. You know what melts me?

25
00:01:13,289 --> 00:01:15,991
Spain. The beach.
You in a bikini.

26
00:01:16,093 --> 00:01:20,595
Me holding a sangria. Oh.
Wait. What's that I hear?

27
00:01:20,698 --> 00:01:23,198
Oh... The baby's crying.
We can't go to Spain.

28
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:26,284
Sangria? That's
why I don't get a kid?

29
00:01:26,386 --> 00:01:28,147
- I can make a friggin' sangria.
- Just a minute!

30
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:30,222
- What?
- Yang, you got a suture kit?

31
00:01:30,324 --> 00:01:31,834
- Yeah.
- Where's Robbins?

32
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:33,419
- In there.
- Robbins!

33
00:01:33,443 --> 00:01:36,277
- What's going on?
- Two! I need two suture kits!

34
00:01:36,379 --> 00:01:39,063
- Why is he screaming?
- Baby! Now!

35
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:40,660
Why are you...?

36
00:01:40,684 --> 00:01:44,052
Oh, God! He's serious!

37
00:01:45,222 --> 00:01:46,522
Holy mother of...

38
00:01:46,624 --> 00:01:48,690
- Get my bag.
- Give me a clamp.

39
00:01:50,894 --> 00:01:52,678
- All right, another clamp.
- Clamp.

40
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:55,730
- Scissors.
- How is he? Is he OK? Is he good?

41
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:58,483
He's great. You did great.

42
00:01:58,585 --> 00:02:00,552
All right.

43
00:02:00,654 --> 00:02:03,572
- Any sounds?
- Not yet.

44
00:02:05,408 --> 00:02:07,792
Come on, baby boy. Come on.

45
00:02:07,894 --> 00:02:10,061
Come on, baby boy. Come on.

46
00:02:10,164 --> 00:02:13,498
Come on.

47
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,968
OK! That's my boy.

48
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:18,931
OK, that's what I'm talking about.
That's what I'm talking about.

49
00:02:18,955 --> 00:02:22,273
Here you go, Grandpa.

50
00:02:43,813 --> 00:02:46,881
Hey. So is it true you helped Teddy
and Mark deliver Little Sloan's baby?

51
00:02:46,983 --> 00:02:48,903
- Yeah, not now.
- What's wrong with you?

52
00:02:49,003 --> 00:02:52,354
Tom Evans, in with your husband.

53
00:02:52,456 --> 00:02:54,388
That's Tom Evans.

54
00:02:54,491 --> 00:02:57,576
- He seems a lot younger than...
- Try and be cool.

55
00:02:57,678 --> 00:03:00,078
- Good morning.
- Hey, hey, hey!

56
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,700
- He's in with Shepherd.
- Who?

57
00:03:01,782 --> 00:03:03,732
Tom Evans.

58
00:03:03,834 --> 00:03:06,117
- Tom Evans is here?
- You didn't know?

59
00:03:06,202 --> 00:03:09,904
He's doing his bloodless CABG
on a beating heart, today in our OR.

60
00:03:10,007 --> 00:03:13,792
- Shepherd didn't tell you?
- No, no...

61
00:03:13,894 --> 00:03:16,256
- Bless you.
- Excuse me. No, he didn't.

62
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,913
An Evans bypass.

63
00:03:18,015 --> 00:03:19,431
Clear your schedule. Scrub in.

64
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:24,068
No, I can't. I gotta go.

65
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:27,538
And here she is. Your
cruise director, Dr. Yang.

66
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,025
Dr. Evans, hi. Hi.

67
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:33,461
Hi, I'm Cristina
Yang. I'm a huge fan.

68
00:03:33,563 --> 00:03:36,297
She's a groupie, but forgive her
because she's one of the finest

69
00:03:36,399 --> 00:03:38,611
- cardio residents you'll meet.
- Quite a recommendation.

70
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:40,875
- You scrubbing in
with me today?
- Yes.

71
00:03:40,904 --> 00:03:42,237
It's an honor and a privilege.

72
00:03:42,339 --> 00:03:43,800
Here are the patient charts

73
00:03:43,824 --> 00:03:45,657
and the most recent labs.

74
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:46,919
If there's anything
else you need, ask.

75
00:03:46,943 --> 00:03:49,122
I'll be around all
day following you.

76
00:03:49,146 --> 00:03:51,863
- If that's OK with you. Uh...
- She is a groupie. I like her.

77
00:03:51,966 --> 00:03:54,332
This is my wife,
Dr. Meredith Grey.

78
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:56,796
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Likewise. I hear great things.

79
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:57,963
I hear them from your husband,

80
00:03:57,987 --> 00:04:01,189
so grain of salt.

81
00:04:02,476 --> 00:04:03,919
- Dr. Yang.
- Yes?

82
00:04:03,943 --> 00:04:05,421
- All yours.
- Yes, of course.

83
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:07,523
The patient is
right this way, sir.

84
00:04:07,547 --> 00:04:10,009
- Think she's
gonna drool on him?
- I think she is.

85
00:04:10,033 --> 00:04:13,735
OK. I gotta go.
I'll see you soon.

86
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:15,337
Is that Thomas
Evans from Baylor?

87
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:16,849
Yes, but don't get too excited.

88
00:04:16,873 --> 00:04:19,808
- He's only here for one case.
- Are you sure?

89
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:22,577
I overheard Chief Shepherd
discussing the fact that Dr. Altman

90
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:25,480
doesn't have a permanent contract,
so it would be a really genius move

91
00:04:25,582 --> 00:04:28,633
- on the chief's
part to go in...
- Here we go again.

92
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:30,485
- What?
- Shut up.

93
00:04:30,587 --> 00:04:33,105
She thinks your
husband walks on water.

94
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:35,823
I don't. I don't. I, um...

95
00:04:35,926 --> 00:04:38,042
No, I'm... I mean...
It's a professional thing.

96
00:04:38,128 --> 00:04:41,145
It's, um... It's a mentor thing.

97
00:04:41,247 --> 00:04:44,398
He's just my mentor.
'Cause he's married... to you.

98
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,601
And you guys are so great.

99
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:50,171
And, um... Together.
Together, as a married couple.

100
00:04:50,273 --> 00:04:52,957
- You... You... You're so great.
- Wow.

101
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:55,243
I, um... I do... I do think

102
00:04:55,345 --> 00:05:00,098
that your husband is brilliant,
but I'm sure that you think that, too.

103
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:03,935
- OK, then.
- Thank you.

104
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:10,892
You can see it, right?

105
00:05:11,795 --> 00:05:14,329
The resemblance?

106
00:05:14,431 --> 00:05:17,849
It's a newborn. It
resembles other newborns.

107
00:05:17,934 --> 00:05:22,236
OK. All right, fine. But you
want incontrovertible proof?

108
00:05:22,338 --> 00:05:23,638
Here we go.

109
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,325
- Look at that.
- Oh.

110
00:05:28,678 --> 00:05:30,273
It's impressive,
I'll give you that.

111
00:05:30,297 --> 00:05:33,348
I mean, a lot of that swelling
is from the birth. It will go down.

112
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:34,749
He's a Sloan.

113
00:05:35,986 --> 00:05:38,453
- Right.
- He's a Sloan.

114
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,966
What is it?

115
00:05:52,068 --> 00:05:54,903
- Trauma choppers.
- Nice.

116
00:05:55,005 --> 00:05:57,772
Hey, could you hand me my...?

117
00:05:57,874 --> 00:06:00,708
Oh... Well, OK. Good morning.

118
00:06:03,847 --> 00:06:05,607
- Good morning.
- Yes, it is.

119
00:06:05,682 --> 00:06:08,316
I have a trauma chopper 15
minutes out and a small window of time

120
00:06:08,418 --> 00:06:12,053
- where I can practice medicine.
- Right. Plus,
Thomas Evans is here.

121
00:06:12,155 --> 00:06:14,940
- He is. He's doing a coronary...
- Is he interviewing for my job?

122
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:17,870
I've been waiting to hear about
a permanent contract from you.

123
00:06:17,894 --> 00:06:20,662
- I haven't,
Thomas Evans is here.
- You have a temporary contract.

124
00:06:20,764 --> 00:06:23,665
- You said you
were looking elsewhere.
- Yeah, I was, but I stopped.

125
00:06:23,767 --> 00:06:28,720
- I didn't know that.
- I'm sorry. I should have told you.

126
00:06:28,822 --> 00:06:31,017
I'd be happy to consider you
for the permanent position.

127
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:34,059
- Consider me? For my job?
- I had to run a search.

128
00:06:34,161 --> 00:06:36,827
I can't get caught
without a head of cardio.

129
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:39,681
OK. Well, I... I'd
like to be considered.

130
00:06:39,783 --> 00:06:41,666
I'll throw you in the mix.

131
00:06:43,887 --> 00:06:45,837
Hey. The baby's sleeping.

132
00:06:46,422 --> 00:06:47,689
Um...

133
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:51,793
Thank you for...

134
00:06:51,895 --> 00:06:54,980
- everything.
- I'm happy to help.

135
00:06:55,065 --> 00:06:58,299
- Dad?
- Hey.

136
00:06:58,402 --> 00:07:00,552
Everything's fine.
The baby's doing great.

137
00:07:02,222 --> 00:07:04,956
- Hey, can you grab my bag?
- Yeah.

138
00:07:10,914 --> 00:07:12,881
What is all this?

139
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:15,833
You...

140
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:18,886
- Did you buy all this for the baby?
- - Yeah.

141
00:07:18,988 --> 00:07:24,458
I figured he was gonna need
stuff. And I was already in the store.

142
00:07:24,561 --> 00:07:27,646
I know it's lame, all the girl
stuff was way better, but...

143
00:07:27,748 --> 00:07:31,899
- Boys like Army crap, right?
- Oh! No, that's
a choking hazard.

144
00:07:32,001 --> 00:07:34,936
Well, he's a little
young for that.

145
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:36,705
And that.

146
00:07:37,941 --> 00:07:40,303
Whatever. It doesn't
really matter anyway.

147
00:07:40,327 --> 00:07:43,094
He's gonna be getting
a lot nicer stuff soon.

148
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:44,512
Here.

149
00:07:44,614 --> 00:07:47,064
This is the number for the
people that are gonna adopt him.

150
00:07:47,167 --> 00:07:49,934
Trish and Keith.
Can you call them?

151
00:07:52,789 --> 00:07:55,924
- Mark...
- Yeah.

152
00:07:56,026 --> 00:08:00,512
- Do you want me
to handle that call?
- No, no. I'll take care of it.

153
00:08:04,184 --> 00:08:07,702
It was a fishing boat accident.
Two patients, one with a head lac

154
00:08:07,804 --> 00:08:10,449
and abdominal pain. The other, something
about a fish hook stuck somewhere.

155
00:08:10,473 --> 00:08:13,091
Why would they send a
chopper for a guy with a fish hook?

156
00:08:13,193 --> 00:08:15,910
I'm pretty sure they said
fish hook, Chief Shepherd.

157
00:08:16,012 --> 00:08:18,062
OK.

158
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,309
"I'm pretty sure they said
fish hook, Chief Shepherd.

159
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:24,386
If I'm wrong, you can spank me.
Chief Shepherd, I do hope I'm wrong."

160
00:08:24,488 --> 00:08:26,037
What do we got?

161
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:29,124
We got the son, head laceration,
crush injuries. The dad's right behind.

162
00:08:29,226 --> 00:08:31,476
- Let's go!
- OK.

163
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:37,114
Fifty-year-old male,
penetrating trauma to the chest,

164
00:08:37,217 --> 00:08:41,118
hypotensive in the field. Got
him two liters of LR en route.

165
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:44,022
Oh! Big hook!

166
00:08:44,892 --> 00:08:47,108
Big hook!

167
00:08:54,635 --> 00:08:58,520
Mrs. Smitte, when is the last
time you took a flight of stairs

168
00:08:58,622 --> 00:08:59,654
instead of an elevator?

169
00:08:59,756 --> 00:09:02,657
God, it's... it's been years.

170
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:06,044
This time next week,
you're gonna do it.

171
00:09:06,146 --> 00:09:07,728
Your grandkids,
you have grandkids?

172
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:10,464
- Two.
- They're not
gonna know what hit 'em.

173
00:09:10,566 --> 00:09:12,044
They won't be able
to keep up with you.

174
00:09:12,068 --> 00:09:13,952
- You mean it?
- I mean it.

175
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:16,204
He means it.

176
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:19,423
Excuse me. Sorry.

177
00:09:19,525 --> 00:09:21,365
- Come in here...
- No.

178
00:09:21,428 --> 00:09:22,727
Why?

179
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:30,935
- Hold steady. Grey, get in there.
- What do we have? Oh, my God.

180
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:32,820
Here we go.

181
00:09:32,922 --> 00:09:34,362
Boat accident.
Something fell on him.

182
00:09:34,424 --> 00:09:36,374
- And the hook?
- Looks like he fell on it.

183
00:09:37,894 --> 00:09:39,789
- Pressure's at 68, systolic.
- Tracheal deviation,

184
00:09:39,813 --> 00:09:42,063
absent breath sounds.
Get me a 14-gauge needle.

185
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:44,916
- Right behind you.
- Dad? What are
you doing to him?

186
00:09:45,018 --> 00:09:48,002
- Grey, get him out of here!
- I'm trying. Doug, please.

187
00:09:48,104 --> 00:09:51,206
Oh, God! What the hell is that?

188
00:09:51,308 --> 00:09:54,148
Dad, I don't know what happened. I
had the rope in my hand one minute...

189
00:09:54,194 --> 00:09:56,322
- Doug, Doug, come on.
- No, I did this.

190
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:59,064
- I'm sorry. Dad, I'm so sorry.
- It's OK. It's not your fault.

191
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:00,860
Of course it's his fault!

192
00:10:00,884 --> 00:10:05,220
I was thrown on top of the shark
hook because he let go of the rope.

193
00:10:05,322 --> 00:10:07,822
Who the hell's fault is it?

194
00:10:07,924 --> 00:10:09,652
Let's leave the hook in
until we get him up to the OR.

195
00:10:09,676 --> 00:10:11,626
I'm feeling depressed
skull fracture.

196
00:10:11,728 --> 00:10:14,009
- Order a head CT.
- Right away, chief.

197
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:18,783
That was the first thing he
taught me when I joined the crew.

198
00:10:18,885 --> 00:10:21,403
I don't know how...

199
00:10:24,007 --> 00:10:26,607
We didn't play ball
when I was little.

200
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:28,643
We tied knots. I know
how to tie that knot.

201
00:10:28,745 --> 00:10:32,013
Doug, you made a
mistake. It was an accident.

202
00:10:33,116 --> 00:10:35,099
What if it wasn't?

203
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:38,335
I thought about it sometimes.

204
00:10:38,437 --> 00:10:41,138
Hitting him, or hurting him.

205
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,524
He pisses me off
sometimes. He's harsh and...

206
00:10:43,626 --> 00:10:46,761
- You did this on purpose?
- No.

207
00:10:46,863 --> 00:10:50,015
Not on purpose. I just...

208
00:10:50,117 --> 00:10:52,367
- I don't feel so good.
- OK, try to relax.

209
00:10:52,469 --> 00:10:55,470
Deep breaths. Deep breaths.

210
00:10:56,923 --> 00:11:00,741
OK, Grey, order a head
CT and get a CT angio.

211
00:11:00,843 --> 00:11:04,095
- I saw some fluid
around his spleen.
- I'll do it.

212
00:11:04,197 --> 00:11:06,347
I think there's some...

213
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:10,951
Um... I'll just deal
with the vomit.

214
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,690
So the nurse says
I'm being discharged.

215
00:11:16,793 --> 00:11:20,694
I have to leave tomorrow? I
just had the baby, like, today.

216
00:11:20,796 --> 00:11:22,774
It's a good thing. It
means you're doing great.

217
00:11:22,798 --> 00:11:26,701
No complications.
Right, little man?

218
00:11:26,803 --> 00:11:28,269
Where am I supposed to go?

219
00:11:28,371 --> 00:11:31,872
My mom kicked me out and those
friends I was staying with in Portland

220
00:11:31,974 --> 00:11:35,860
were like, "You gotta pay rent, or
you gotta leave." And I can't pay rent.

221
00:11:35,962 --> 00:11:38,480
I don't have a job.

222
00:11:38,582 --> 00:11:40,665
I don't have anything.

223
00:11:40,767 --> 00:11:42,216
You can stay with me.

224
00:11:42,319 --> 00:11:45,203
- Really?
- Sure.

225
00:11:45,305 --> 00:11:47,204
Until you figure things out.

226
00:11:49,058 --> 00:11:50,958
You're gonna be OK.

227
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,610
Sloans are tough.

228
00:11:53,513 --> 00:11:56,130
You hear that? We're tough.

229
00:11:59,352 --> 00:12:02,854
Maybe we should... keep him.

230
00:12:06,443 --> 00:12:08,492
You think you could?

231
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:10,628
Maybe.

232
00:12:14,217 --> 00:12:17,235
- You wanna hold him?
- No.

233
00:12:17,337 --> 00:12:19,604
- I don't think I know how to...
- Do you wanna hold him?

234
00:12:19,706 --> 00:12:21,806
He's pretty great.

235
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:26,177
- Look who it is.
- Hi, baby.

236
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:30,164
Look at that.

237
00:12:30,283 --> 00:12:32,667
You're a natural.

238
00:12:34,571 --> 00:12:36,320
It's up to you.

239
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:37,872
If you think we can do this.

240
00:12:37,974 --> 00:12:39,707
Raise him.

241
00:12:39,809 --> 00:12:43,127
Together. If you think we can.

242
00:12:45,882 --> 00:12:48,894
Hey, guys. He really needs to
go to the nursery to be monitored

243
00:12:48,918 --> 00:12:52,570
- and get his newborn check-up.
- I'm monitoring
and I did the exams.

244
00:12:52,672 --> 00:12:54,189
He's all good.

245
00:12:58,428 --> 00:13:02,012
Mark, when you get a minute,
I'd love to have a quick word.

246
00:13:07,136 --> 00:13:09,921
- Caught a big one?
- That's funny.

247
00:13:10,022 --> 00:13:11,706
He's got a small hematoma.

248
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:16,244
Can I ask you something?
Why did you hire Altman?

249
00:13:16,346 --> 00:13:19,781
- What'd you see in her?
- Well, what do you see in her?

250
00:13:19,883 --> 00:13:23,635
I think she's good. She works
hard. I feel bad even looking.

251
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:26,587
I'd feel worse, though, having
a stronger candidate pass us by.

252
00:13:26,689 --> 00:13:28,873
It's not the
feel-good job, is it?

253
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:31,759
- Can't you give me
a little insight?
- No.

254
00:13:31,861 --> 00:13:33,961
See, that'd be
doing the job for you.

255
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:36,664
I'm not gonna give you the fish.

256
00:13:36,766 --> 00:13:38,900
You got a big hook in there.

257
00:13:39,001 --> 00:13:40,868
Learn to fish yourself.

258
00:13:43,673 --> 00:13:45,484
What kind of life is that?

259
00:13:45,508 --> 00:13:49,493
Living five months
at a time on a boat,

260
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:53,531
working 20 hours
in terrible conditions?

261
00:13:53,633 --> 00:13:57,718
In 2007, the CDC marked crab fishing
the most dangerous job in the U.S.

262
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:01,606
with an annual fatality rate 28
times higher than any other job.

263
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,075
What?

264
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:07,127
Dude, it's like working
with Forrest Gump.

265
00:14:07,229 --> 00:14:10,898
The kid's 15. He
should be doing algebra

266
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,050
and going to school dances.

267
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:16,003
- How much you bet he did it?
- What?

268
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:20,725
- Hooked his old man on purpose.
- I'd say 70 percent
it was an accident,

269
00:14:20,827 --> 00:14:23,460
thirty percent attempted murder.

270
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:25,897
What? Karev's right.

271
00:14:25,999 --> 00:14:28,800
Too much nature
makes people crazy.

272
00:14:28,902 --> 00:14:32,970
OK, there is the tear.

273
00:14:33,055 --> 00:14:35,039
Grey? You wanna embolize it?

274
00:14:35,141 --> 00:14:37,725
Really? I've never
done it before.

275
00:14:37,827 --> 00:14:40,862
- But I've read that if you...
- You want this kid
to bleed to death

276
00:14:40,964 --> 00:14:43,264
or what?

277
00:14:43,366 --> 00:14:45,800
Don't analyze everything.

278
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:49,570
Just... do it.

279
00:14:50,873 --> 00:14:51,934
Tell me you called the parents.

280
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:53,069
Sloan's having second thoughts.

281
00:14:53,093 --> 00:14:54,370
Sloan picked those parents.

282
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:55,209
She asked you to call them.

283
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:56,371
She was pretty clear.

284
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:58,112
Now, she's not clear. By law,

285
00:14:58,214 --> 00:15:00,626
she's got 48 hours before the
court terminates her parental right.

286
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:02,628
- Sloan changed her mind?
- - Maybe.

287
00:15:02,652 --> 00:15:04,163
- That's great!
- No, it's not.

288
00:15:04,187 --> 00:15:06,265
She can't change her mind?
People change their minds.

289
00:15:06,289 --> 00:15:08,856
This baby needs parents,
not an 18-year-old child

290
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:10,436
- and a father
she met five minutes ago.
- Shut up!

291
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:13,494
- Mark...
- No.

292
00:15:13,596 --> 00:15:15,412
You don't get to tell
me what to do here.

293
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:18,983
I appreciate your
help, but you don't...

294
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:23,521
My mom is dead.

295
00:15:23,623 --> 00:15:26,039
My dad's never gonna
get off the couch again.

296
00:15:26,141 --> 00:15:29,527
I don't have any
brothers or sisters.

297
00:15:29,629 --> 00:15:31,445
This is my grandson.

298
00:15:31,547 --> 00:15:33,848
My grandson!

299
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:36,050
I'm not gonna turn him
over to some strangers

300
00:15:36,152 --> 00:15:39,570
when I might have a
chance at a family. So just...

301
00:15:39,673 --> 00:15:41,439
give me a minute here!

302
00:15:48,815 --> 00:15:50,798
- How's he doing?
- His temp's high.

303
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:53,700
I can't figure out why.
Is his dad in surgery yet?

304
00:15:53,802 --> 00:15:56,037
Yeah, they're prepping him now.

305
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:00,300
Doug, would you like to see your
dad before he goes into surgery?

306
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:03,394
- He's probably calmed down.
- He hates me.

307
00:16:03,496 --> 00:16:05,763
He's always hated me.

308
00:16:05,865 --> 00:16:08,333
Now, I practically killed him.

309
00:16:08,435 --> 00:16:10,584
He doesn't want to see me.

310
00:16:15,175 --> 00:16:17,508
Once when I was little,

311
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:19,310
I was really mad at my mom.

312
00:16:19,412 --> 00:16:22,880
And I had heard that
saccharine can kill you,

313
00:16:22,983 --> 00:16:26,366
and so, I swear to God, I almost
put ten packets of Sweet 'N Low

314
00:16:26,469 --> 00:16:29,370
into her coffee all at the
same time. I was this close.

315
00:16:29,472 --> 00:16:31,772
While she was thinking of
sweetening her mom's coffee,

316
00:16:31,874 --> 00:16:34,675
I tried to run my old man
over with a car. It's normal.

317
00:16:34,777 --> 00:16:37,645
No, that's... That's not normal.

318
00:16:38,932 --> 00:16:42,182
Those hooks were
meant to catch sharks.

319
00:16:42,284 --> 00:16:44,702
He's never letting me
near him or the boat again.

320
00:16:44,804 --> 00:16:48,105
I don't even know
where I'm supposed to go.

321
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:50,958
Ow! My head is, like, pounding.

322
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:55,412
Hey. We should get blood
cultures and a repeat CBC.

323
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:57,225
We need to find out
why he's burning up.

324
00:16:57,249 --> 00:17:00,851
You do that, Sweet 'N Low. I'm
gonna go watch them pull out a hook.

325
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:09,187
The baby smiled at Mark.

326
00:17:09,211 --> 00:17:11,731
He looked up and smiled
at him like he knew him.

327
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:15,449
That poor baby's
parents just sitting...

328
00:17:15,551 --> 00:17:20,320
- Stop calling
them the baby's...
- That baby's parents.

329
00:17:20,422 --> 00:17:24,224
The mature, capable,
financially secure,

330
00:17:24,326 --> 00:17:26,510
emotionally stable,
loving parents,

331
00:17:26,612 --> 00:17:29,646
who were deemed fit by Sloan
and the State of Washington,

332
00:17:29,748 --> 00:17:32,282
are sitting there
by the telephone,

333
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:36,920
staring at the sky-blue nursery
walls that they just painted.

334
00:17:37,022 --> 00:17:38,222
Those are the parents,

335
00:17:38,324 --> 00:17:41,508
not Mr. Midlife Crisis
and his teenage kid

336
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:45,396
who bought her infant son a bag of
lollipops and Juicy Couture onesies.

337
00:17:45,498 --> 00:17:47,414
So she has a lot to learn.

338
00:17:47,517 --> 00:17:50,401
No, she doesn't.

339
00:17:50,503 --> 00:17:54,405
She made the one sound parenting
decision she needs to make.

340
00:17:54,507 --> 00:17:57,874
She found a lovely
couple to raise her baby.

341
00:17:57,977 --> 00:18:01,645
She did that months ago when she
wasn't flooded with postpartum hormones

342
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:04,899
or overwhelmed by
heartfelt pleas from her dad.

343
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:09,570
She had time to think clearly

344
00:18:09,672 --> 00:18:12,673
about what was right for her
and what was right for the baby.

345
00:18:12,775 --> 00:18:15,325
She made a decision,
a good decision.

346
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:18,429
And it would be great if we
could all try and respect that.

347
00:18:18,531 --> 00:18:21,565
OK.

348
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:26,486
Crap. Sloan.

349
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:33,305
- Is he OK?
- I don't know. He won't stop crying.

350
00:18:33,329 --> 00:18:34,740
- What happened?
- I don't know.

351
00:18:34,764 --> 00:18:36,724
I was holding him and
Mark went to go get a bottle

352
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:39,033
and he started crying.
He's not stopping.

353
00:18:39,134 --> 00:18:41,135
- I think something's wrong.
- What happened?

354
00:18:41,237 --> 00:18:43,337
Sloan got worried.
The baby's fine.

355
00:18:43,439 --> 00:18:45,283
He's just hungry, is all.

356
00:18:45,307 --> 00:18:47,185
No, I... I don't
know how to do this.

357
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:48,859
We're right here
if you need help.

358
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:52,129
No, he's crying. I don't
think he wants me to do it.

359
00:18:54,033 --> 00:18:55,416
Here.

360
00:18:55,518 --> 00:18:59,020
- Oh, God! I don't feel so good.
- You've been up all night.

361
00:18:59,122 --> 00:19:01,988
You're exhausted and
dehydrated. Drink that.

362
00:19:09,131 --> 00:19:11,143
Thought I'd check to
see how far along we are.

363
00:19:11,167 --> 00:19:13,568
Almost ready to extract
the hook. Suction.

364
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:17,337
After they get him off the hook,
we'll evacuate the hematoma

365
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,441
- and plate the skull fragments?
- - I thought we'd throw him back.

366
00:19:20,543 --> 00:19:23,927
Catch and release.

367
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:27,431
Thank you, Dr. Kepner.

368
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:30,784
Well, Walter's lucky. It looks like
he doesn't have to lose any lung.

369
00:19:30,886 --> 00:19:33,254
Yeah, no thanks to his kid.

370
00:19:33,356 --> 00:19:34,966
Well, it was an
accident. It happens.

371
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:37,102
The kid shouldn't have
been there in the first place.

372
00:19:37,126 --> 00:19:38,653
Well, he's the guy's son.

373
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:40,722
Family business. There's
something to be said for loyalty.

374
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:42,680
Put a person in a job like that

375
00:19:42,782 --> 00:19:43,876
because they have
the skills to handle it,

376
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:47,568
not because they're
your friend. Or your kid.

377
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:51,138
Are you intentionally equating
me with the idiot son that dropped

378
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:56,309
the crab cage on his dad, or is
that just a happy coincidence?

379
00:19:56,411 --> 00:19:59,046
All right. Ready to extract
the hook from the man.

380
00:19:59,148 --> 00:20:01,215
All right, nobody
move but Dr. Hunt.

381
00:20:01,317 --> 00:20:02,967
On my count.

382
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:05,719
One...

383
00:20:06,488 --> 00:20:07,571
two...

384
00:20:11,594 --> 00:20:13,044
Snagged an artery.

385
00:20:13,146 --> 00:20:15,226
- I'm sorry.
- God bless you.

386
00:20:24,257 --> 00:20:26,640
He's stabilized
and ready for you.

387
00:20:29,212 --> 00:20:30,928
I'm sorry.

388
00:20:34,934 --> 00:20:38,886
Look, if this doesn't go your
way, please don't take it personally.

389
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:41,548
You're an incredible
surgeon. I see that.

390
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:44,892
It's that Evans has
published dozens of times.

391
00:20:44,994 --> 00:20:47,027
- He's won awards.
- She won a Bronze Star

392
00:20:47,129 --> 00:20:49,480
for service to her country.
Does that not count?

393
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:08,499
And the anastomosis is done.

394
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:11,435
- Fine suture hook?
- You're not
using the side clamp?

395
00:21:11,537 --> 00:21:14,070
No. It's a special technique.

396
00:21:14,173 --> 00:21:18,275
I get a very clean, very
nice anastomosis this way.

397
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:21,161
Much less trauma to the
surrounding structures.

398
00:21:21,263 --> 00:21:23,314
You just parachuted
that vein graft down.

399
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:27,050
Is that to avoid memory in
the suture or tangles later on?

400
00:21:27,153 --> 00:21:30,955
Excellent observation, Yang. Have
you already applied for your fellowships?

401
00:21:31,057 --> 00:21:34,125
- Oh, I'm only in third year.
- Oh. Right, I forgot.

402
00:21:34,227 --> 00:21:36,543
It feels like I'm
working with a fellow.

403
00:21:38,715 --> 00:21:40,547
Thank you.

404
00:21:40,649 --> 00:21:42,883
Oh. Would you like me
to cut the last suture?

405
00:21:42,985 --> 00:21:45,425
That's OK. I already got it.

406
00:21:46,372 --> 00:21:48,138
Wow!

407
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,607
It looks like you've
barely operated at all.

408
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:53,944
- It's so perfect.
- That is the goal, Dr. Yang.

409
00:21:54,046 --> 00:21:55,312
That is the goal.

410
00:21:59,435 --> 00:22:00,675
Excellent.

411
00:22:08,177 --> 00:22:10,244
Hook guy is stable
for now. How's the kid?

412
00:22:10,346 --> 00:22:13,663
Crappy. Nothing we can do
now until we finish with the angio.

413
00:22:13,765 --> 00:22:15,565
- Lexie's baby-sitting.
- Hey!

414
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:19,620
Have you, uh, seen Evans?
It was amazing. Who saw?

415
00:22:19,722 --> 00:22:22,723
Dude, you're like a
kid with trading cards.

416
00:22:22,825 --> 00:22:25,692
- Except with heart surgeons.
- Yeah. I gotta have 'em all.

417
00:22:25,795 --> 00:22:27,995
I thought Teddy was
the love of your life.

418
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:30,697
She is. She is, but...

419
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,333
Evans, brilliant.
I mean brilliant.

420
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:36,804
So is she, but...
I love them both.

421
00:22:36,906 --> 00:22:40,641
I'm a cardio-thoracic whore.
Saying it makes me feel so good.

422
00:22:40,743 --> 00:22:42,175
Speaking of whores,

423
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:44,689
has anyone seen the love-struck
intern fawning over my husband?

424
00:22:44,713 --> 00:22:46,930
- April's not an intern.
- Bat your eyes like that,

425
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:50,751
- you're an intern.
- Don't worry. That's not Derek's thing.

426
00:22:50,853 --> 00:22:53,754
- Anymore.
- I was the love-struck intern.

427
00:22:53,856 --> 00:22:56,006
- It is his thing.
- He's grown out of it.

428
00:22:56,108 --> 00:22:58,904
Out of what, chicks who shave
their legs and laugh at his jokes?

429
00:22:58,928 --> 00:23:02,163
- Sure, he's grown out of it.
- I shave my legs.

430
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:06,166
Sometimes.

431
00:23:06,268 --> 00:23:07,378
You could always call
him Chief Shepherd.

432
00:23:07,402 --> 00:23:08,902
- Ew!
- I don't make the rules.

433
00:23:09,005 --> 00:23:10,504
I'm telling you, it's a thing.

434
00:23:10,623 --> 00:23:14,374
- Powerful guys
like adoring girls.
- Oh, my...

435
00:23:14,477 --> 00:23:16,026
Whatever. Do what you want.

436
00:23:20,066 --> 00:23:23,167
Oh! That baby's delicious.

437
00:23:23,269 --> 00:23:26,570
Yeah. I was thinking I
could take paternity leave.

438
00:23:26,672 --> 00:23:28,189
At least for a couple of weeks.

439
00:23:28,291 --> 00:23:31,257
It'd help Sloan get
the hang of things.

440
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,605
I don't know if a couple
of weeks is enough.

441
00:23:33,629 --> 00:23:35,829
She's a good kid.
She's got good instincts.

442
00:23:35,931 --> 00:23:39,099
Well, her instincts lead her to
put the baby up for adoption.

443
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:43,136
I don't know.

444
00:23:43,238 --> 00:23:45,906
She's unformed,
she's a baby herself.

445
00:23:47,059 --> 00:23:49,059
I don't know.

446
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:51,394
Yeah.

447
00:23:51,497 --> 00:23:53,129
I don't know either.

448
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,134
Arizona wants to go to Spain.

449
00:23:57,236 --> 00:24:00,616
She's picking a suntan over
a family, which I don't get.

450
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,907
Didn't she have, like, a
happy, idyllic childhood?

451
00:24:03,009 --> 00:24:07,327
Totally! She talks to her
parents every day. Every day!

452
00:24:07,429 --> 00:24:09,041
Part of which could
be the brother thing.

453
00:24:09,065 --> 00:24:11,031
- What brother thing?
- He died.

454
00:24:18,673 --> 00:24:20,740
Her brother died.

455
00:24:21,777 --> 00:24:23,676
And I'm an idiot.

456
00:24:44,467 --> 00:24:47,767
You have a cold. It could
have happened to any of us.

457
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:50,504
Yeah, but it didn't.

458
00:24:50,606 --> 00:24:52,623
It was me.

459
00:24:52,725 --> 00:24:56,393
On the day that Shepherd is
interviewing Evans for my job

460
00:24:56,496 --> 00:24:59,797
and I'm the new girl here
who no one really knows,

461
00:24:59,899 --> 00:25:03,917
and even Yang is
in love with Evans

462
00:25:04,019 --> 00:25:06,954
and I... Ah!

463
00:25:07,056 --> 00:25:10,624
And I have a freaking cold!

464
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:17,564
- I'm sorry!
- It's OK.

465
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:28,959
You're gonna be OK.

466
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:57,721
What happened?

467
00:25:57,823 --> 00:26:00,457
He became lethargic and
febrile. Coughed up blood.

468
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:03,805
His X-ray shows there's a large
hemothorax where we took the hook out.

469
00:26:03,829 --> 00:26:06,246
We'll have to go back in. The
repairs must not have held.

470
00:26:06,348 --> 00:26:09,060
Should get a CT to confirm before
cutting into a patient that's unstable.

471
00:26:09,084 --> 00:26:13,003
There's no time for that. He could
go into multi-system organ failure.

472
00:26:13,105 --> 00:26:15,923
Shepherd, you have to trust
that I know what I'm doing.

473
00:26:20,145 --> 00:26:22,762
I'll call up the OR. Let
them know you're coming.

474
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:28,301
Yes this is Chief Shepherd,
we're gonna need a cardiac room.

475
00:26:29,739 --> 00:26:31,789
- You paged me?
- What's up?

476
00:26:31,891 --> 00:26:35,331
Doug has fever and rigors and he's
starting to get a productive cough.

477
00:26:35,394 --> 00:26:38,912
So deal with it. Hook guy's tanking.
He coughed up blood or something.

478
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:40,374
They're taking him
back to surgery.

479
00:26:40,398 --> 00:26:41,543
Wait, he coughed up blood?

480
00:26:41,567 --> 00:26:43,278
What did it look
like, currant jelly?

481
00:26:43,302 --> 00:26:46,764
Did he have leukocytosis with a
left shift? His P.A.CO2 was 28, right?

482
00:26:46,788 --> 00:26:50,757
I don't know, Encyclopedia
Brown. I didn't memorize the chart.

483
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:53,760
Let him go, Grey, he has
a surgery he wants to see.

484
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:56,596
Thank you, Dr. Bailey.

485
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:59,766
Dr. Bailey, both patients
have productive coughs

486
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:01,412
and signs and
symptoms of sepsis.

487
00:27:01,436 --> 00:27:05,271
I am probably wrong, but
if I'm not, this is infectious.

488
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:07,474
You're probably not
wrong. You're probably right.

489
00:27:07,576 --> 00:27:10,310
Why do you want to hand
your big save over to Karev,

490
00:27:10,412 --> 00:27:13,396
who's gonna march around the
hospital acting like he put it together?

491
00:27:13,499 --> 00:27:16,333
- I didn't...
- You are handing your power

492
00:27:16,435 --> 00:27:19,803
over to a boy because
he's giving you sex.

493
00:27:19,905 --> 00:27:23,606
- I'm not...
- I'm Dr. Bailey. I know everything.

494
00:27:23,709 --> 00:27:26,509
And you have a superpower.

495
00:27:26,611 --> 00:27:29,413
That memory of
yours is a superpower.

496
00:27:29,515 --> 00:27:31,948
And on top of it,
you're a good doctor.

497
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:35,886
And yet you're letting Alex
Karev treat you like a scut monkey.

498
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:38,488
I don't care how good the
sex is, if that's what it costs,

499
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:40,557
- you're paying too much.
- I'm not!

500
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:43,760
- Scut monkey all day.
- Doctor?

501
00:27:44,647 --> 00:27:46,146
Thank you.

502
00:27:48,734 --> 00:27:50,934
- I was right.
- I know.

503
00:27:51,019 --> 00:27:54,671
Now, what are you
going to do about it?

504
00:28:00,829 --> 00:28:02,607
Karev, what's the
status on your patient?

505
00:28:02,631 --> 00:28:04,675
Temperature spiked.
The dude's doing fine.

506
00:28:04,699 --> 00:28:07,885
- We're running new labs.
- Dr. Altman, stop!

507
00:28:07,987 --> 00:28:11,287
Dr. Grey, you always shout at
people right before they start operating?

508
00:28:11,389 --> 00:28:14,408
Doug has Klebsiella pneumonia,
and I'm guessing Walter does too.

509
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:17,293
We need to start imipenem
stat or things could get ugly fast.

510
00:28:17,395 --> 00:28:19,657
- Klebsiella?
- Highly contagious in close quarters.

511
00:28:19,681 --> 00:28:22,298
Like living on a crab
boat for months at a time.

512
00:28:22,401 --> 00:28:24,818
I think that hemothorax is a
mixture of blood and an empyema.

513
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,853
- Thanks for the heads-up.
- You were busy.

514
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:31,458
- Maybe we should
open and check...
- No, I, um...

515
00:28:33,311 --> 00:28:36,512
- I think I was wrong here.
<i>- Get him out of the OR,</i>

516
00:28:36,615 --> 00:28:38,315
<i>into the ICU now!</i>

517
00:28:42,855 --> 00:28:45,338
- This day has to end.
- Tell me about it.

518
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,274
I was supposed to watch

519
00:28:47,376 --> 00:28:49,442
Tom Evans work.

520
00:28:49,545 --> 00:28:53,296
Meanwhile, I got stuck in an OR all
day watching Teddy Altman decompose

521
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:54,876
- in front of my eyes.
- I don't understand.

522
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,767
- What's Tom Evans doing here?
- Taking a look around.

523
00:28:57,869 --> 00:29:00,721
Why? You don't need
Evans. You got Teddy.

524
00:29:00,823 --> 00:29:04,475
- I don't need Teddy
if I've got Evans.
- What?

525
00:29:04,577 --> 00:29:06,810
No, you can't. Me and...

526
00:29:06,912 --> 00:29:09,279
Me and Teddy, we...

527
00:29:09,381 --> 00:29:11,064
See, this is my point exactly.

528
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:13,750
I can't staff this hospital
based on the fact

529
00:29:13,852 --> 00:29:16,686
that she's Hunt's friend
and your flavor of the month.

530
00:29:16,771 --> 00:29:20,924
I'm just sick of worrying about
this. This job's exhausting.

531
00:29:21,026 --> 00:29:24,277
I'm sorry. That's what you're
complaining about? Screw you.

532
00:29:24,379 --> 00:29:27,130
I'm losing everything today.

533
00:29:27,232 --> 00:29:29,082
Everything!

534
00:29:36,525 --> 00:29:38,241
Go ahead.

535
00:29:41,396 --> 00:29:45,065
How am I supposed to call a couple of
strangers and tell them to take my kid?

536
00:29:46,485 --> 00:29:48,819
Sloan's your kid, Mark.

537
00:29:50,522 --> 00:29:52,005
You're not losing her.

538
00:29:53,175 --> 00:29:54,841
They're not taking her.

539
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:02,265
Hey. Did you see me in the OR?

540
00:30:02,367 --> 00:30:05,169
- You're an idiot.
- What?

541
00:30:05,271 --> 00:30:08,332
You really think that Evans is gonna
take you under his award-winning wing?

542
00:30:08,356 --> 00:30:11,140
He won't. He doesn't need you.

543
00:30:11,242 --> 00:30:13,793
He doesn't care about students.
He's a rock star, not a teacher.

544
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:16,763
He is a rock star. Teddy,
he's totally a rock star.

545
00:30:16,865 --> 00:30:19,349
Did you see him in there?
He was like an octopus!

546
00:30:19,451 --> 00:30:22,252
Doing a million things, cutting,
retracting, suctioning all at once.

547
00:30:22,354 --> 00:30:24,888
You think I need you to hold
my instruments when I operate?

548
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:27,135
You think that helps
me save the patient?

549
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:29,993
I do it so that you
can learn, Cristina.

550
00:30:30,095 --> 00:30:33,079
I'd be a lot faster in
the OR without you.

551
00:30:33,181 --> 00:30:35,226
Did you notice you never
even touched that patient?

552
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:38,501
Your gloves were totally clean at
the end of surgery. You learn a lot?

553
00:30:38,603 --> 00:30:41,888
Teddy, it was one surgery.

554
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:44,791
He's here for my job,
Cristina. Do you not get that?

555
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:49,730
If Evans is in, I'm out. So, you know,
good luck with your new attending.

556
00:30:57,706 --> 00:30:59,706
I get it.

557
00:31:06,565 --> 00:31:09,799
You watch parents go through

558
00:31:09,901 --> 00:31:12,936
horrible, unimaginable pain.

559
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:15,472
Every day.

560
00:31:15,574 --> 00:31:19,042
And you went through
horrible, unimaginable pain

561
00:31:19,144 --> 00:31:22,829
when you lost your brother.
And your parents never got over it.

562
00:31:22,931 --> 00:31:26,566
But if we had a baby...

563
00:31:26,668 --> 00:31:29,953
our baby's not gonna be
one of those kids in your NICU.

564
00:31:30,872 --> 00:31:33,473
Our baby won't be your brother.

565
00:31:33,575 --> 00:31:35,625
I mean, knock on wood.

566
00:31:37,496 --> 00:31:40,747
Do you know how
happy our baby would be?

567
00:31:43,385 --> 00:31:45,218
I'm gonna say this once.

568
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:48,187
And then I'm not
gonna say it again.

569
00:31:49,123 --> 00:31:50,774
I'm not broken.

570
00:31:50,876 --> 00:31:52,642
I'm not some psychodrama.

571
00:31:52,745 --> 00:31:56,012
My lack of interest in having
a child is not some pathology

572
00:31:56,114 --> 00:31:58,275
that you can pat yourself on
the back for having diagnosed.

573
00:31:58,299 --> 00:32:02,552
I like my life the way that it
is. I don't want it to change.

574
00:32:02,654 --> 00:32:05,238
I thought I liked
it with you in it.

575
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,374
I hope I'm not wrong.

576
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:14,113
Wait.

577
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:34,350
- I called your mother.
- What?

578
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:36,385
Why?! She kicked me out!

579
00:32:36,488 --> 00:32:38,866
She's on her way.
She misses you.

580
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:41,041
- She's worried about you.
- Right.

581
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:44,194
- I'm worried about you, too.
- If this is the part
where you tell me

582
00:32:44,296 --> 00:32:47,697
that you talked to her
and she convinced you

583
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:52,369
that me keeping my baby was a bad
idea because I'm young and irresponsible...

584
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:55,188
That's not what the
conversation was about.

585
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:57,907
OK, well, so you thought it over

586
00:32:58,010 --> 00:33:00,978
and you decided that you
don't have time for a kid?

587
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:03,913
That's fine. I get it. You
have a life. You're busy.

588
00:33:04,015 --> 00:33:05,743
But you know what? I can
handle this kid on my own.

589
00:33:05,767 --> 00:33:08,702
No, you can't.

590
00:33:08,804 --> 00:33:15,007
Having a kid is hard. And you
are young and irresponsible.

591
00:33:15,109 --> 00:33:18,010
And keeping him is
probably a bad idea.

592
00:33:18,112 --> 00:33:22,649
But if that is your decision,
if that's what you want,

593
00:33:22,751 --> 00:33:25,502
then I'm in. I'm all in.

594
00:33:25,604 --> 00:33:28,822
I'm not too busy for my family.

595
00:33:30,392 --> 00:33:31,792
But...

596
00:33:36,114 --> 00:33:38,682
don't keep the baby for me.

597
00:33:38,783 --> 00:33:41,150
You'll always have me.

598
00:33:41,253 --> 00:33:43,637
And I'll always want you.

599
00:33:43,739 --> 00:33:47,107
And that's true no
matter what you decide.

600
00:33:51,613 --> 00:33:54,380
You're my kid.

601
00:33:54,483 --> 00:34:00,953
And I'm so happy I
get to know you, Sloan.

602
00:34:01,055 --> 00:34:04,040
I'm so happy about that.

603
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:10,079
Hey. What are you
doing right now?

604
00:34:10,181 --> 00:34:11,759
- Uh, I'm...
- Can we walk and talk?

605
00:34:11,783 --> 00:34:13,894
- Where are we going?
- You need to talk
to Derek Shepherd

606
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:18,288
about Teddy, and why replacing her
with Evans would be a huge mistake.

607
00:34:19,808 --> 00:34:22,142
Remember, be
persuasive and strong.

608
00:34:22,244 --> 00:34:25,328
- Use a lot of words.
- Cristina, I'm not 12.

609
00:34:25,431 --> 00:34:28,165
- I'm not saying you're 12.
- Dr. Yang.

610
00:34:28,267 --> 00:34:31,101
- Good work today.
- Thank you, Dr. Evans.

611
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,237
This is important.

612
00:34:39,978 --> 00:34:42,128
- Shepherd.
- Hunt.

613
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:45,816
Before you say anything, I
want you to know that I think, uh...

614
00:34:47,619 --> 00:34:49,419
she's a fine surgeon.

615
00:34:49,521 --> 00:34:52,455
- Evans is interested?
- Yeah, I think so.

616
00:34:54,142 --> 00:34:56,543
Evans is good, he's really good.

617
00:34:56,645 --> 00:34:59,311
Patients would come here
from all over. That would be...

618
00:34:59,414 --> 00:35:01,894
That would be
good for this hospital.

619
00:35:02,584 --> 00:35:04,518
- I'm glad you feel that way.
- Yeah.

620
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:07,020
And Teddy has a
lot of connections.

621
00:35:07,122 --> 00:35:11,308
Mainly on the East
Coast, so she'd be fine.

622
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:14,144
If that's what you decide.

623
00:35:15,481 --> 00:35:17,147
She'd be fine.

624
00:35:27,426 --> 00:35:28,992
Thank you.

625
00:35:39,438 --> 00:35:42,555
Walter, I need you
to squeeze my hands.

626
00:35:42,657 --> 00:35:45,191
All right, let's do a
little push against them.

627
00:35:46,294 --> 00:35:48,478
Not bad, all things considered.

628
00:35:53,035 --> 00:35:54,567
You like being captain?

629
00:35:54,669 --> 00:35:56,419
Do I like it?

630
00:35:58,356 --> 00:35:59,556
No.

631
00:36:00,475 --> 00:36:02,075
Me neither.

632
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:04,010
You know what it beats, though?

633
00:36:04,112 --> 00:36:06,996
It beats not being captain.

634
00:36:12,454 --> 00:36:13,820
Come here, son.

635
00:36:20,145 --> 00:36:21,645
You OK?

636
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:26,649
This was my fault.

637
00:36:27,752 --> 00:36:29,719
I'm sorry.

638
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:39,662
Thanks, Dad.

639
00:36:42,050 --> 00:36:43,216
Just remember.

640
00:36:43,318 --> 00:36:47,570
The Sloans, we bloom early.

641
00:36:47,672 --> 00:36:51,408
So when you start to grow
hair on your face, don't be shy.

642
00:36:52,076 --> 00:36:53,676
Live it up.

643
00:36:53,779 --> 00:36:57,030
All the other guys
will be jealous.

644
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,767
It's OK to rub
it in a little bit.

645
00:37:02,103 --> 00:37:03,503
But not a lot.

646
00:37:03,622 --> 00:37:07,473
You don't wanna be
considered too full of yourself.

647
00:37:07,575 --> 00:37:10,826
No one likes a vain
guy in the locker room.

648
00:37:12,564 --> 00:37:14,564
Mark.

649
00:37:17,669 --> 00:37:19,602
Oh, my God!

650
00:37:21,006 --> 00:37:22,805
Is that him?

651
00:37:29,448 --> 00:37:31,514
Hey there.

652
00:37:31,616 --> 00:37:34,300
Hi there, little guy.

653
00:37:34,403 --> 00:37:36,436
Oh!

654
00:37:36,538 --> 00:37:38,905
He's so beautiful!

655
00:37:43,845 --> 00:37:44,994
This is...

656
00:37:47,281 --> 00:37:49,382
And this.

657
00:37:50,819 --> 00:37:52,418
Thank you.

658
00:38:00,178 --> 00:38:02,912
- He has your dad's chin.
- What?

659
00:38:03,014 --> 00:38:05,881
That's crazy.

660
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:14,707
Come in.

661
00:38:15,844 --> 00:38:18,328
Chief Shepherd, are you busy?

662
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:22,615
- You just called
me Chief Shepherd?
- I did.

663
00:38:22,718 --> 00:38:25,285
Go with it.

664
00:38:25,387 --> 00:38:28,037
What are you doing
with the shades?

665
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:30,707
Shh...

666
00:38:30,792 --> 00:38:33,259
- No one can know.
- No one can know what?

667
00:38:33,361 --> 00:38:36,062
About our secret
love, Chief Shepherd.

668
00:38:36,164 --> 00:38:39,532
- Secret love?
- By the way, chief,

669
00:38:39,634 --> 00:38:43,202
I picked up your
dry-cleaning for you.

670
00:38:44,206 --> 00:38:46,589
And I...

671
00:38:46,692 --> 00:38:51,177
- Ooh!
- Had your car washed.

672
00:38:53,031 --> 00:38:55,131
And I dusted off your desk.

673
00:38:55,233 --> 00:38:58,718
With my bottom.

674
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:03,206
Is there anything else I can
do for you, Chief Shepherd?

675
00:39:03,308 --> 00:39:06,809
Let me see if I can come
up with a list of things.

676
00:39:09,914 --> 00:39:11,981
Oh, Chief Shepherd!

677
00:39:21,226 --> 00:39:23,159
Give me a beer.

678
00:39:24,396 --> 00:39:26,462
You screwed me today.
That was my patient.

679
00:39:26,565 --> 00:39:28,915
You made me look like a
moron. Get your own beer.

680
00:39:31,586 --> 00:39:33,152
You...

681
00:39:33,254 --> 00:39:37,090
You can't be an ass to me all day
and expect me to give you respect.

682
00:39:37,192 --> 00:39:40,726
You can't be an ass to me all day
and then expect me to give you sex.

683
00:39:40,828 --> 00:39:45,114
And you can stop with the patronizing
nicknames. I am a nice person,

684
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:49,385
who couldn't even bring myself to
attempt matricide by Sweet 'N Low.

685
00:39:49,487 --> 00:39:51,432
That makes me
charming to anybody else.

686
00:39:51,456 --> 00:39:55,308
I am a nice person.
And I am nice to you.

687
00:39:55,410 --> 00:39:57,193
So, whatever your damage is,

688
00:39:57,295 --> 00:39:59,375
you better start to
be frickin' nice to me,

689
00:39:59,431 --> 00:40:03,499
or I am not spreading my legs for you
anymore, no matter how much I want to.

690
00:40:03,601 --> 00:40:06,151
Now give me a damn beer!

691
00:40:12,027 --> 00:40:17,497
<i>As doctors, we have an
arsenal of weapons at the ready.</i>

692
00:40:35,534 --> 00:40:38,034
My cousin's baby
punched her in the face.

693
00:40:40,371 --> 00:40:43,022
Literally.

694
00:40:43,124 --> 00:40:45,775
She got a black eye
from a one-year-old.

695
00:40:52,383 --> 00:40:54,450
Who needs that, right?

696
00:40:55,553 --> 00:40:57,753
I don't need that.

697
00:40:59,657 --> 00:41:03,425
They scream,
they're grimy, they...

698
00:41:03,528 --> 00:41:06,395
smell like poop, the
house smells like poop.

699
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,066
Don't.

700
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:12,234
Don't.

701
00:41:12,336 --> 00:41:14,971
Don't.

702
00:41:16,574 --> 00:41:19,441
<i>Antibiotics to kill infections,</i>

703
00:41:19,544 --> 00:41:22,111
<i>narcotics to fight pain.</i>

704
00:41:26,451 --> 00:41:28,601
Tell me you're staying.

705
00:41:29,754 --> 00:41:31,787
Please.

706
00:41:35,259 --> 00:41:37,293
I'm staying.

707
00:41:43,068 --> 00:41:44,400
OK.

708
00:41:45,203 --> 00:41:46,870
OK.

709
00:41:46,972 --> 00:41:50,773
<i>Scalpels and retractors to
remove tumors and cancers.</i>

710
00:41:50,876 --> 00:41:53,926
- Derek!
- - <i>To eradicate the threat.</i>

711
00:41:54,028 --> 00:41:55,678
I heard you gave
Teddy a contract.

712
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:58,614
- Yes, I did.
- I'm glad.

713
00:41:58,716 --> 00:42:03,402
It was the right move.
Loyalty, it's a powerful thing.

714
00:42:03,504 --> 00:42:05,471
It makes for a great chief.

715
00:42:05,573 --> 00:42:07,673
I offered it to Evans.

716
00:42:08,476 --> 00:42:10,543
He passed.

717
00:42:12,296 --> 00:42:14,430
<i>But just the physical threat.</i>

718
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:17,433
<i>For every other kind...</i>

719
00:42:18,553 --> 00:42:20,320
<i>you're on your own.</i>
