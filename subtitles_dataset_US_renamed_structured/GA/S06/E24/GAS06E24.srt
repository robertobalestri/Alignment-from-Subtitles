1
00:00:02,436 --> 00:00:04,047
<i>The human life is
made up of choices.</i>

2
00:00:04,071 --> 00:00:07,305
<i>Yes or no. In or
out. Up or down.</i>

3
00:00:07,407 --> 00:00:08,869
<i>And then there are
the choices that matter.</i>

4
00:00:08,893 --> 00:00:11,092
<i>To love or hate.</i>

5
00:00:11,194 --> 00:00:14,930
<i>To be a hero or to be a coward.</i>

6
00:00:15,032 --> 00:00:16,915
<i>To fight or to give in.</i>

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,483
<i>To live...</i>

8
00:00:18,969 --> 00:00:20,335
<i>or die.</i>

9
00:00:35,269 --> 00:00:37,852
My name is April Kepner.

10
00:00:37,954 --> 00:00:41,056
I'm 28 years old. I
was born on April 23rd.

11
00:00:41,158 --> 00:00:45,761
In Ohio. I'm from
Columbus, Ohio.

12
00:00:45,862 --> 00:00:50,014
My mom's a teacher and
my dad is a farmer... Corn.

13
00:00:50,117 --> 00:00:53,118
Corn, he grows corn.

14
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:55,954
Their names are Karen and Joe.

15
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:57,622
I have three sisters.

16
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:59,240
Libby's the oldest, I'm next

17
00:00:59,343 --> 00:01:01,342
and then there's
Kimmie and Alice.

18
00:01:01,444 --> 00:01:03,879
I haven't done anything yet.

19
00:01:03,981 --> 00:01:06,982
I haven't... I've barely lived.

20
00:01:07,084 --> 00:01:09,685
I'm not finished yet.
No one's loved me yet.

21
00:01:09,803 --> 00:01:14,239
Please, please.
I'm someone's child.

22
00:01:14,341 --> 00:01:17,726
I'm a person. I'm a person.

23
00:01:20,881 --> 00:01:22,364
Run.

24
00:01:27,788 --> 00:01:31,039
Mr. Clark...

25
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:38,446
<i>Live or die.</i>

26
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,234
<i>That's the important choice.</i>

27
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,604
<i>And it's not always
in our hands.</i>

28
00:01:48,058 --> 00:01:50,842
Derek could still be
alive! I'm going, Cristina.

29
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:52,864
- No, you are not.
- Let me go. Please.

30
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:56,498
You'll get killed, I'm not gonna let
that happen. You gotta go through me.

31
00:02:02,406 --> 00:02:05,440
We made it all the way home from
Iraq alive and now there's this guy

32
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:07,776
with his people-shooting
hat on here in a hospital

33
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:09,811
which is the safest
place in the world.

34
00:02:09,914 --> 00:02:13,465
- Is there a point to this or...
- I think you love me.

35
00:02:13,567 --> 00:02:15,918
I think you love Cristina
and I think you love me too.

36
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:18,286
You tried to get
Shepherd to get rid of me

37
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:19,972
so you wouldn't have to choose.

38
00:02:20,074 --> 00:02:22,140
But, people-shooting-hat
guy is here and Owen,

39
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:25,577
for my sake and for Cristina's
sake you have to choose.

40
00:02:25,679 --> 00:02:28,180
- Her or me.
- Fine. No one. No one.

41
00:02:28,282 --> 00:02:29,508
I'm choosing no one.

42
00:02:29,532 --> 00:02:33,151
I am taking myself out
of this equation and I'm...

43
00:02:38,508 --> 00:02:39,875
Oh, my God.

44
00:02:41,812 --> 00:02:43,378
He's dead.

45
00:02:44,515 --> 00:02:45,592
We can't go to the ICU.

46
00:02:45,616 --> 00:02:47,627
We stay here,
we're sitting ducks.

47
00:02:47,651 --> 00:02:49,451
We're taking this
patient out of here.

48
00:02:49,553 --> 00:02:51,253
- Who are you calling?
- 911.

49
00:02:51,354 --> 00:02:54,473
Why are they only getting
civilians out? Where's the staff?

50
00:02:54,575 --> 00:02:57,659
Policy is to clear visitors
room by room, floor by floor,

51
00:02:57,761 --> 00:02:59,428
before non-essential
hospital personnel.

52
00:02:59,529 --> 00:03:02,208
Did they get the shooter? Do
you know where the shooter is?

53
00:03:02,232 --> 00:03:04,427
- Do you know who
the shooter is?
- No, sir.

54
00:03:04,451 --> 00:03:06,663
- Do you know anything?
- <i>Dr. Owen Hunt</i>
<i>from Seattle Grace...</i>

55
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:08,247
- Commander, I've got sound.
<i>- We are coming out</i>

56
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:09,421
<i>with a critical patient.</i>

57
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:11,168
<i>Dr. Callie Torres.
I'm up on peds,</i>

58
00:03:11,192 --> 00:03:12,802
<i>we've got a kid with
a ruptured appendix.</i>

59
00:03:12,826 --> 00:03:15,343
<i>Dr. Miranda Bailey. I'm on five.</i>

60
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:19,297
<i>- He shot a doctor. In the ICU.</i>
<i>- There are two dead</i>
<i>security guards...</i>

61
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:21,599
<i>This guy, six-one,
graying hair, moustache...</i>

62
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:23,313
<i>Dr. Charles Percy's been shot...</i>

63
00:03:23,337 --> 00:03:24,502
<i>he shot a nurse.</i>

64
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:26,015
<i>I got a doctor up here, Karev...</i>

65
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,467
<i>Please come, we need help.</i>

66
00:03:27,491 --> 00:03:29,152
<i>We've got a GSW to the chest,</i>

67
00:03:29,176 --> 00:03:31,037
<i>I need a way outta here
if he's gonna make it.</i>

68
00:03:31,061 --> 00:03:33,590
<i>He was looking for the
chief, specifically the chief.</i>

69
00:03:33,614 --> 00:03:35,414
<i>He shot him. He shot
Derek Shepherd...</i>

70
00:03:35,499 --> 00:03:37,565
<i>right in front of
us. We need help.</i>

71
00:03:39,269 --> 00:03:42,987
Hold on, OK? Hold on. I
love you. Please don't die.

72
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:46,107
Get out of here, Meredith,
before he shoots you.

73
00:03:46,209 --> 00:03:48,627
Do not die. Do you understand?

74
00:03:48,712 --> 00:03:50,144
I can't live without you.

75
00:03:50,246 --> 00:03:52,291
- I called the police.
- If you die, I die.

76
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:54,435
Good, they're coming.
The police are coming.

77
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:56,752
They're not gonna get here.
They're not coming for us.

78
00:03:56,854 --> 00:03:58,953
- Not in time.
- I picked you!

79
00:03:59,055 --> 00:04:01,201
- What are we gonna do?
- I choose you. You don't die on me!

80
00:04:01,225 --> 00:04:02,952
- Derek needs surgery.
- You stay awake!

81
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:06,010
- What do we do?
- You stay awake!

82
00:04:06,096 --> 00:04:09,580
Stay awake. Derek!
Derek, stay awake!

83
00:04:09,682 --> 00:04:11,450
- OK. OK.
- Stay awake!

84
00:04:21,061 --> 00:04:23,411
April. Come on. We're
taking Derek down to the OR.

85
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:26,431
Teddy, she's in the OR.
She can save him. Come on.

86
00:04:28,585 --> 00:04:30,268
I saw on<i> Oprah</i> or somewhere

87
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,354
if you tell them
details about yourself,

88
00:04:32,456 --> 00:04:33,599
they're less likely to kill you.

89
00:04:33,623 --> 00:04:36,307
Kepner, get up.
Come on! Come on!

90
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:38,026
Follow me. Just follow me.

91
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:42,029
Gotta eat more bacon.

92
00:04:42,131 --> 00:04:44,065
- What?
- You stop yourself

93
00:04:44,167 --> 00:04:47,185
from doing a lot of crap
that you want to do in life.

94
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,487
I mean, I'm probably dying now

95
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:52,924
and I'm telling you, you
gotta eat more bacon.

96
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:54,943
Have more sex.

97
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:58,145
OK. I will. I'll eat more bacon.

98
00:04:58,248 --> 00:04:59,914
But you gotta hang in there,

99
00:05:00,016 --> 00:05:01,645
'cause she's gonna
be back any minute.

100
00:05:01,669 --> 00:05:04,018
She had to go to the
blood bank and back.

101
00:05:13,547 --> 00:05:15,864
Oh, Mr. Clark...

102
00:05:15,966 --> 00:05:18,817
I didn't plan to shoot
all those people.

103
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:24,456
Of course, you didn't...
No, you were... sad,

104
00:05:24,558 --> 00:05:26,658
you were grieving.

105
00:05:28,779 --> 00:05:31,079
I only planned to
shoot Dr. Shepherd.

106
00:05:33,934 --> 00:05:35,734
And Dr. Webber.

107
00:05:39,623 --> 00:05:40,938
And you.

108
00:05:45,329 --> 00:05:47,078
You unplugged the machines.

109
00:05:49,632 --> 00:05:52,600
Your hands killed my Alison.

110
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:36,261
- Is he dead?
- He's unconscious.

111
00:06:36,363 --> 00:06:39,664
His vitals are tanking. And there's
nothing more I can do for him.

112
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:42,149
Don't die, Alex.
Please don't die.

113
00:06:42,251 --> 00:06:43,869
This was my fault.

114
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:47,538
I unplugged his wife. I'm
so sorry, this was my fault.

115
00:06:49,459 --> 00:06:52,527
I love you. Do you hear me?

116
00:06:54,431 --> 00:06:57,199
I love you.

117
00:06:57,301 --> 00:07:00,785
Now you're gonna feel a poke, and it's
gonna hurt but only for a little while.

118
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:02,164
- No squirming.
- It hurts!

119
00:07:02,188 --> 00:07:04,467
- All right. Squeeze my hand tight!
- Good.

120
00:07:04,491 --> 00:07:07,826
Tight, tight. Come
on. Wow, you're strong.

121
00:07:17,337 --> 00:07:19,037
There are only children here.

122
00:07:22,543 --> 00:07:24,525
They shot me.

123
00:07:24,627 --> 00:07:28,363
There are children in
here. Only children here.

124
00:07:28,465 --> 00:07:30,532
There's only children here.

125
00:07:32,635 --> 00:07:34,269
Mr...?

126
00:07:34,972 --> 00:07:37,372
Clark. Gary Clark.

127
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:40,598
There are only children here.

128
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:43,761
Only children here.

129
00:07:43,864 --> 00:07:45,563
Mr. Clark...

130
00:07:46,432 --> 00:07:48,099
Here are some...

131
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:51,453
bandages.

132
00:07:53,156 --> 00:07:55,574
Only children here.

133
00:07:56,944 --> 00:07:58,760
I want my mommy.

134
00:07:58,862 --> 00:08:03,181
Press them to the wound
and it'll stop the bleeding.

135
00:08:04,451 --> 00:08:07,802
- I want my mommy.
- Only...

136
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:11,689
- children are here. Only children.
- OK.

137
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:14,258
Just take them. Take them.

138
00:08:24,221 --> 00:08:25,570
Take them and go.

139
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:28,173
- There are only children...
- I want my mommy.

140
00:08:35,298 --> 00:08:36,998
Thank you.

141
00:08:47,844 --> 00:08:50,312
- I want my mommy!
- All right.

142
00:08:50,414 --> 00:08:53,294
- I want my mommy!
- All right. OK, I know you do.

143
00:08:53,383 --> 00:08:56,468
I know. I know you do and
she's gonna be back soon,

144
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:58,202
but until she gets here,

145
00:08:58,304 --> 00:09:01,606
you have the best doctor in the
whole world with you right now.

146
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:06,261
Yeah. Dr. Robbins is the best
doctor in this entire hospital.

147
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:08,713
I think in the whole world.

148
00:09:08,815 --> 00:09:13,134
Yeah, people feel so much
better after she helps them,

149
00:09:13,236 --> 00:09:16,737
sometimes people feel better
just after she walks in the room.

150
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:22,660
'Cause she has got
this super magic smile.

151
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:27,165
Yeah, and when
she smiles at you,

152
00:09:27,267 --> 00:09:28,916
everything gets better.

153
00:09:30,854 --> 00:09:33,988
You don't know it 'cause you
have your back to her now, but

154
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:35,573
she is giving you...

155
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:40,311
Wow, she's giving you
her best super magic smile.

156
00:09:42,482 --> 00:09:44,298
Isn't that right, Dr. Robbins?

157
00:09:46,569 --> 00:09:48,036
Right.

158
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,972
I am, Ruby.

159
00:09:53,126 --> 00:09:55,827
- I am.
- OK.

160
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:58,863
I gotta call the police, tell
them what happened, OK?

161
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:00,999
I... I'm good.

162
00:10:02,002 --> 00:10:03,084
I'm good.

163
00:10:05,422 --> 00:10:08,423
Does the name Gary
Clark mean anything to you?

164
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:10,842
Yes.

165
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:13,878
Gary Clark's wife was a
patient here. She was my patient.

166
00:10:13,963 --> 00:10:16,481
He's suing the hospital. Why?

167
00:10:20,503 --> 00:10:22,553
Mer, you prep him.

168
00:10:22,656 --> 00:10:24,421
April and I are
gonna go find Teddy.

169
00:10:24,524 --> 00:10:26,535
- She should still be
on the floor.
- OK.

170
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:29,460
Everything's gonna be
fine, OK, Mer? I promise. OK.

171
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:30,962
OK, they're going to find Teddy.

172
00:10:31,064 --> 00:10:32,931
It's gonna be OK.
It's gonna be OK.

173
00:10:33,033 --> 00:10:34,965
It's gonna be OK.

174
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:37,549
Kiss me.

175
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:48,213
I'm not going to die. I promise.

176
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:52,267
Good. 'Cause that would
be the worst break-up ever.

177
00:10:52,369 --> 00:10:54,869
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

178
00:10:59,008 --> 00:11:01,976
- The packing isn't holding.
- - What does that mean?

179
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:04,813
It means I need to
get him to an OR.

180
00:11:04,915 --> 00:11:07,798
Someone is coming,
someone will come. Like a cop...

181
00:11:07,901 --> 00:11:11,368
No! We need to get him to
an OR. That's his last chance,

182
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:13,254
if he's going to live. OK?

183
00:11:13,356 --> 00:11:14,973
How are we even gonna do that?

184
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:17,876
We can... We can barely
hold him up on his side.

185
00:11:17,978 --> 00:11:20,144
Uh...

186
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:23,814
There. There, there.
Give me the sheet.

187
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:33,792
It's creepy quiet down here.

188
00:11:33,894 --> 00:11:36,928
- He's down here.
- No. He is not down here.

189
00:11:38,932 --> 00:11:40,531
God, he's down here

190
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:41,878
and he's gonna
come out and shoot us.

191
00:11:41,902 --> 00:11:43,801
Will you shut up?!

192
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:46,582
You're freaking me out and I don't
have time to be freaked out right now.

193
00:11:46,606 --> 00:11:48,305
Mer is a mess, Derek is a mess,

194
00:11:48,407 --> 00:11:51,208
you are a mess,
and I am in charge.

195
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:53,594
And I say that no
one is down here.

196
00:11:54,731 --> 00:11:55,975
Don't shoot, don't shoot!

197
00:11:55,999 --> 00:11:58,483
You are not supposed
to be walking around.

198
00:11:58,585 --> 00:12:00,963
- Damn it, Jackson.
- Is that your blood? Are you OK?

199
00:12:00,987 --> 00:12:02,770
No, I'm fine. I'll
go get Altman.

200
00:12:02,872 --> 00:12:04,572
- Altman's not down here.
- Hunt.

201
00:12:04,674 --> 00:12:07,241
- They left.
- What, they left?!

202
00:12:07,343 --> 00:12:10,878
OK, you know what? Someone shot
Derek. He's got a GSW to the chest.

203
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:14,448
He needs surgery now. Tell me
there's an attending on this floor!

204
00:12:20,223 --> 00:12:22,740
April, in the OR there
are two OR nurses

205
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:24,742
and an anesthesiologist.
Get them.

206
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:28,179
Tell them to set up
for a cardiac procedure.

207
00:12:28,281 --> 00:12:31,232
What? Why? If we don't have a
surgeon, what are we going to do?

208
00:12:32,619 --> 00:12:34,018
We have a surgeon.

209
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,704
What? Who's gonna
operate on Dr. Shepherd?

210
00:12:39,459 --> 00:12:40,825
I am.

211
00:12:52,806 --> 00:12:55,089
You can do this,
right? You're sure?

212
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:57,191
Every GSW is different.

213
00:12:57,293 --> 00:13:00,161
It's not a blueprint. It's
half-instinct, half-improv.

214
00:13:00,263 --> 00:13:02,847
And... I'm very good.

215
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:07,618
For a resident, I'm very good.

216
00:13:10,606 --> 00:13:12,790
You can't be in there.

217
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:15,176
I can't do this if you're
in there staring at me

218
00:13:15,278 --> 00:13:17,412
with big, sad "Don't
kill McDreamy" eyes.

219
00:13:19,482 --> 00:13:21,049
We're ready for you.

220
00:13:21,151 --> 00:13:22,517
April...

221
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:25,803
Meredith is gonna
sit here on the floor.

222
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:27,338
I want you to stay with her.

223
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,356
If she tries to enter my OR,

224
00:13:29,459 --> 00:13:32,844
or even if she looks like she's
gonna get up to take a peek,

225
00:13:32,946 --> 00:13:35,963
I want you stop her. I don't
care how, you stop her.

226
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:39,033
- OK.
- He is my husband.

227
00:13:39,135 --> 00:13:42,920
Do you want me to kill
him? Is that what you want?!

228
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:54,565
I will do my very best work.

229
00:13:55,819 --> 00:14:00,087
But please, Meredith, I am
begging you, sit down and wait.

230
00:14:23,897 --> 00:14:25,112
Izzie?

231
00:14:26,499 --> 00:14:29,250
Alex? It's Lexie.

232
00:14:29,352 --> 00:14:30,884
Alex...

233
00:14:30,987 --> 00:14:34,121
Iz? I'm sorry.

234
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:37,508
Don't go.

235
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:41,545
We got married,
please don't go...

236
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:43,581
I'm not going anywhere.

237
00:14:44,434 --> 00:14:47,602
You came back for me, Iz.

238
00:14:48,705 --> 00:14:50,537
I came back.

239
00:14:51,574 --> 00:14:53,591
Don't ever leave me.

240
00:14:53,693 --> 00:14:56,160
Don't ever leave me again.

241
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:59,847
I won't. I won't ever leave you.

242
00:14:59,949 --> 00:15:02,433
We're always gonna
be together, OK?

243
00:15:02,535 --> 00:15:04,501
Always.

244
00:15:09,425 --> 00:15:12,676
This floor is clear. We're
going to evacuate you now.

245
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:17,498
We've cleared one floor,
we'll clear the others.

246
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,680
You've got five guys searching
150,000 square feet of hospital...

247
00:15:20,704 --> 00:15:22,170
That's how it
works. Don't worry.

248
00:15:22,271 --> 00:15:23,471
He's not getting out of there.

249
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:25,506
- Casey!
- Yes, sir?

250
00:15:25,608 --> 00:15:28,676
Pull a DMV photo of Gary
Clark, have Dr. Webber confirm.

251
00:15:28,778 --> 00:15:31,646
Shut down the elevators.
We wanna isolate this guy.

252
00:15:31,748 --> 00:15:34,181
- Where can I find Dr. Webber?
- He's right over...

253
00:15:39,155 --> 00:15:42,590
We got a GSW straight
from the OR, he's still critical.

254
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:44,859
Let's get him to the paramedics.

255
00:15:46,662 --> 00:15:48,924
- Have you gotten the shooter?
- We need to clear you...

256
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,431
- You gotten the doctors out?
- No.

257
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:53,400
This is a secure area. We
need to move you to holding.

258
00:15:57,523 --> 00:15:59,140
She's still in there.

259
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:02,860
Go.

260
00:16:04,113 --> 00:16:05,613
It's OK.

261
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:09,200
It's OK to choose.

262
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:15,873
We're good.

263
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,926
Sir, you're not allowed to...
Gonna need you to... Sir!

264
00:16:19,028 --> 00:16:20,795
Come back now!

265
00:16:36,696 --> 00:16:38,663
Stop crying.

266
00:16:41,684 --> 00:16:45,319
Look, it took me a
long time to find him.

267
00:16:45,888 --> 00:16:47,788
A long time.

268
00:16:49,242 --> 00:16:53,344
And even then it took me a long
time to even know that I wanted him.

269
00:16:54,647 --> 00:16:58,332
To be married, to be
his wife, to have his kids.

270
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:00,601
And now that I realize that...

271
00:17:00,703 --> 00:17:04,771
He's lying on the table in there
and my best friend's hands...

272
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:07,758
are inside his chest.

273
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:11,795
You don't get to cry about that.

274
00:17:22,825 --> 00:17:24,825
Reed was my best friend.

275
00:17:25,995 --> 00:17:27,845
And she died today.

276
00:17:44,663 --> 00:17:47,076
GSW to the right chest.
We put in a chest tube.

277
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:50,268
He's gotten three liters of LR
and two units of packed cells.

278
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:51,568
Get him into an ambulance.

279
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:53,415
Call Seattle Pres, let
them know we're coming!

280
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:57,442
- I need to update that chart...
- He's gonna be OK, right?

281
00:17:59,145 --> 00:18:01,773
Do you feel anything? Can you
see where the blood's coming from?

282
00:18:01,797 --> 00:18:05,116
Not yet. Damn it, I can't see
anything. Give me some suction.

283
00:18:05,201 --> 00:18:06,634
No, no, no, no, no...

284
00:18:08,387 --> 00:18:10,805
It's right by to the aorta.

285
00:18:10,907 --> 00:18:12,667
- You can do this.
- I know that.

286
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:14,258
I just wanted it to be easy.

287
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:17,694
Not the hardest freaking
repair in the history of the world!

288
00:18:20,366 --> 00:18:21,766
I don't know what to do.

289
00:18:23,369 --> 00:18:25,353
There's massive
bleeding in the lungs.

290
00:18:25,454 --> 00:18:27,822
There is a bullet lodged
right next to the aorta

291
00:18:27,923 --> 00:18:29,557
and a huge hematoma.

292
00:18:30,393 --> 00:18:31,592
Would Teddy use a graft

293
00:18:31,694 --> 00:18:33,455
- or clamp and sew?
- I think she'd...

294
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:34,640
- Pig or cow.
- What?

295
00:18:34,664 --> 00:18:36,430
Pig or cow, Cristina?

296
00:18:40,303 --> 00:18:42,570
Clamp and sew.
Definitely clamp and sew.

297
00:18:42,672 --> 00:18:43,937
Give me a clamp.

298
00:18:45,358 --> 00:18:46,574
Badass.

299
00:18:46,676 --> 00:18:48,587
- How much further?
- We're almost there.

300
00:18:48,611 --> 00:18:50,922
We're gonna get
him on the elevator,

301
00:18:50,946 --> 00:18:55,483
and then we'll be
right at the OR floor.

302
00:18:55,585 --> 00:18:57,418
We're almost there.

303
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,903
We're almost there, OK, Charles?

304
00:18:59,989 --> 00:19:03,207
- We're almost there?
- Just a few more minutes.

305
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:09,513
Dr. B?

306
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:20,791
There's a hum elevators make
when they are on. There's a hum.

307
00:19:22,195 --> 00:19:23,610
There's no hum.

308
00:19:23,712 --> 00:19:25,379
What does that mean?

309
00:19:25,481 --> 00:19:28,499
It means the elevators...

310
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:31,535
they're off!

311
00:19:32,972 --> 00:19:34,789
The elevators aren't working!

312
00:19:34,891 --> 00:19:37,241
The elevators aren't working!

313
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:41,178
We need to get to the OR!
Turn the elevators back on!

314
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,714
Turn them back on!

315
00:19:43,816 --> 00:19:46,533
Oh, damn it!

316
00:19:46,636 --> 00:19:49,553
Turn the elevators back on!

317
00:19:49,639 --> 00:19:52,723
Please! That man is still
here somewhere. He'll hear us!

318
00:19:52,825 --> 00:19:55,826
Please, stop, stop,
stop. Please, Dr. B!

319
00:19:56,446 --> 00:19:58,646
OK. OK.

320
00:19:58,748 --> 00:20:00,731
What are we gonna do?

321
00:20:03,553 --> 00:20:05,118
What are we gonna do?

322
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:13,678
Dr. B, what's the plan?

323
00:20:14,747 --> 00:20:16,880
You have a plan, right, Dr. B?

324
00:20:18,284 --> 00:20:20,050
What do we do?

325
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:24,888
Please?

326
00:21:02,045 --> 00:21:03,944
We can't get to the OR,

327
00:21:04,046 --> 00:21:07,014
but he has to get to the OR.

328
00:21:07,116 --> 00:21:11,201
He has to get to the
OR, or he's... Dr. B?

329
00:21:11,303 --> 00:21:13,370
Miranda.

330
00:21:13,472 --> 00:21:15,723
We should be on
a first name basis.

331
00:21:15,825 --> 00:21:17,775
Miranda.

332
00:21:31,357 --> 00:21:32,723
OK.

333
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:41,665
I'm dying, right?

334
00:21:45,154 --> 00:21:47,288
Am I dying now?

335
00:21:50,759 --> 00:21:54,895
Yes. Yes, Charles,
you are dying.

336
00:21:56,599 --> 00:21:58,732
But I don't want you to worry.

337
00:21:58,834 --> 00:22:01,885
I don't want you to be afraid.

338
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:04,921
'Cause I... am not
going to leave you, OK?

339
00:22:05,024 --> 00:22:06,056
Mary.

340
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:11,261
Mary... Mary and I...

341
00:22:11,363 --> 00:22:13,063
are gonna be with you...

342
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:14,632
the whole time.

343
00:22:17,036 --> 00:22:19,386
You are not alone. You hear me?

344
00:22:26,713 --> 00:22:28,345
You are not alone.

345
00:22:39,492 --> 00:22:41,608
Owen, thank God!
Derek's been shot.

346
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:43,738
No one was down here,
we didn't know what to do.

347
00:22:43,762 --> 00:22:46,730
Cristina's in there, told me not
to look, but she might need help.

348
00:22:51,921 --> 00:22:54,087
She seems to be doing OK.

349
00:22:57,893 --> 00:23:00,661
But I'll just head in there
and see what I can do.

350
00:23:03,065 --> 00:23:04,931
But you're not scrubbing in?

351
00:23:06,251 --> 00:23:09,870
I'll assess first. If she
needs me, then I'll scrub in.

352
00:23:09,972 --> 00:23:12,489
Cristina was right. You
should stay down there.

353
00:23:12,591 --> 00:23:14,658
OK? Don't move.

354
00:23:17,864 --> 00:23:21,882
A real surgeon is here. That's good.
That means Derek's going to be OK.

355
00:23:25,738 --> 00:23:28,923
Whoa, just calm down. Calm
down. Tell me what the problem is.

356
00:23:29,025 --> 00:23:30,519
- Owen...
- I'm here.

357
00:23:30,543 --> 00:23:32,370
- Owen...
- Hold on!

358
00:23:32,394 --> 00:23:35,846
- Talk to me.
- Stop fixing him.

359
00:23:36,883 --> 00:23:40,201
Let him die. Let
him lie there and die.

360
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:45,322
Do you want me to shoot you?

361
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:46,606
Stop fixing him!

362
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:55,122
- No.
- Cristina...

363
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,112
No, Jackson, clamp the hilum

364
00:23:57,136 --> 00:23:59,430
so we get control
of the hemorrhage,

365
00:23:59,454 --> 00:24:01,566
- so I can get visualization.
- Don't you dare.

366
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:03,456
Clamp the hilum so I can see.

367
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:06,644
You stay back.

368
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:10,447
You stay back.

369
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:11,829
Owen, I can't stop. I have to...

370
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:14,534
I know. Just keep
going. Keep going.

371
00:24:14,636 --> 00:24:16,837
You stop or I will shoot you.

372
00:24:16,939 --> 00:24:19,389
Hey! That is the woman I love.

373
00:24:19,491 --> 00:24:22,660
If you shoot her,
touch her, I will kill you!

374
00:24:22,762 --> 00:24:24,211
And I said stay back.

375
00:24:31,703 --> 00:24:33,286
Maybe I shoot you first.

376
00:24:34,656 --> 00:24:37,541
I shoot you and then I shoot
her and then I shoot Shepherd.

377
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:39,376
Is that what you want?

378
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:43,714
I didn't come here for this.

379
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:46,967
My wife is dead.
He's responsible.

380
00:24:47,636 --> 00:24:49,136
I came here for justice.

381
00:24:49,238 --> 00:24:51,705
An eye for an eye.

382
00:24:51,807 --> 00:24:54,625
The only person I want
in this room is Shepherd.

383
00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:56,543
Now back off!

384
00:24:59,031 --> 00:25:01,214
And you step away
from that table.

385
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:02,966
Please...

386
00:25:05,387 --> 00:25:07,721
Shoot me.

387
00:25:08,473 --> 00:25:09,690
Meredith...

388
00:25:09,792 --> 00:25:11,858
You want justice, right?

389
00:25:11,961 --> 00:25:15,729
Your wife died. I know what
happened. Derek told me the story.

390
00:25:15,831 --> 00:25:19,532
Lexie Grey pulled the plug
on your wife, she's my sister.

391
00:25:19,635 --> 00:25:22,669
Dr. Webber? He
was your wife's doctor.

392
00:25:23,773 --> 00:25:26,239
I'm the closest thing
he has to a daughter.

393
00:25:26,342 --> 00:25:30,644
The man on the
table, I'm his wife.

394
00:25:30,746 --> 00:25:34,130
If you wanna hurt them
the way that you hurt...

395
00:25:35,017 --> 00:25:36,083
shoot me.

396
00:25:36,184 --> 00:25:39,052
- I'm your "eye for an eye."
- Meredith.

397
00:25:49,531 --> 00:25:52,032
You tell Derek that I love
him and that I'm sorry.

398
00:25:52,134 --> 00:25:53,617
Meredith...

399
00:25:57,974 --> 00:26:00,808
Wait! She's pregnant.

400
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:02,776
You wouldn't shoot a
woman who's pregnant?

401
00:26:03,512 --> 00:26:04,844
Please.

402
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:10,968
No! No!

403
00:26:12,721 --> 00:26:14,505
- No! What?
- Raise your hands.

404
00:26:14,607 --> 00:26:17,590
Trust me, raise your hands. He's
going to shoot again, raise your hands!

405
00:26:17,693 --> 00:26:19,287
- I'm stopping!
- No!

406
00:26:19,311 --> 00:26:22,245
- See? I've stopped.
- Listen to me.

407
00:26:22,347 --> 00:26:25,427
In a few seconds, his heart is
going to pump blood into his chest

408
00:26:25,451 --> 00:26:26,699
and stop beating.

409
00:26:26,801 --> 00:26:30,254
You'll see it on the
monitor. Just wait. Wait for it.

410
00:26:30,356 --> 00:26:33,857
Watch the monitor
and wait for it.

411
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,576
- Please, don't stop!
- Shut up!

412
00:26:39,031 --> 00:26:40,397
No, no.

413
00:26:45,187 --> 00:26:47,754
No! Derek!

414
00:26:48,957 --> 00:26:52,159
No, no, no.

415
00:26:52,261 --> 00:26:54,911
See? It's over.

416
00:26:58,049 --> 00:26:59,733
It's over. He's dead.

417
00:27:02,705 --> 00:27:04,404
It's over.

418
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,814
No!

419
00:27:15,317 --> 00:27:17,767
Derek!

420
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:27,027
Give me a 4-0 pledgeted
suture. Jackson, get me his vitals.

421
00:27:28,863 --> 00:27:31,098
Got a pulse of
128. BP's cycling.

422
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,200
Mer? Is Owen dead?

423
00:27:34,236 --> 00:27:36,219
Dr. Grey! Is Owen dead?!

424
00:27:42,028 --> 00:27:45,179
He's alive. He's alive. He's
unconscious, but he's alive.

425
00:27:45,281 --> 00:27:46,997
Take Owen to the
OR across the way

426
00:27:47,099 --> 00:27:49,166
and take that bullet
out. Get April to help.

427
00:27:49,267 --> 00:27:51,096
- Cristina.
- I can't talk now.

428
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,904
I'm trying to save your guy, now
please go and try and save mine.

429
00:27:57,943 --> 00:28:01,011
- Remind me to thank you later.
- I will.

430
00:28:05,201 --> 00:28:07,301
I don't hurt anymore.

431
00:28:08,854 --> 00:28:11,972
Pain's gone. That's
a bad sign, isn't it?

432
00:28:13,375 --> 00:28:15,074
Yes.

433
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:20,880
Can you do something for me?

434
00:28:20,982 --> 00:28:22,194
Can you find Reed?

435
00:28:22,218 --> 00:28:25,052
When this is over,
can you find her?

436
00:28:25,154 --> 00:28:27,387
I always...

437
00:28:27,489 --> 00:28:32,042
I always had a crush on
her. I don't think she knows.

438
00:28:32,144 --> 00:28:35,578
She knows. Girls always know.

439
00:28:36,398 --> 00:28:38,631
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

440
00:28:42,221 --> 00:28:44,754
But can you tell her anyway?

441
00:28:46,692 --> 00:28:49,576
Can you find her and
tell her I loved her?

442
00:28:52,414 --> 00:28:54,080
I loved her so much.

443
00:28:54,182 --> 00:28:55,932
OK.

444
00:28:56,034 --> 00:28:57,768
And you tell her...

445
00:28:58,804 --> 00:29:01,188
You tell her I was a catch.

446
00:29:01,290 --> 00:29:03,873
You tell her I was
a hot, hot catch

447
00:29:03,976 --> 00:29:06,910
and she missed
out on a great guy.

448
00:29:07,012 --> 00:29:08,795
All right.

449
00:29:08,897 --> 00:29:11,331
And you tell her I was brave.

450
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:16,185
Even if I turn coward

451
00:29:16,288 --> 00:29:20,324
and start crying and asking
for my mom in a minute.

452
00:29:21,293 --> 00:29:23,571
You lie and tell her
I died brave, OK?

453
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:27,598
You are very brave, Charles.

454
00:29:27,699 --> 00:29:29,500
OK? I'm the coward.

455
00:29:29,602 --> 00:29:31,718
I'm the one that told
that man I was a nurse.

456
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:33,720
You're smart.

457
00:29:36,992 --> 00:29:39,742
You were smart. I
wish I was that smart.

458
00:29:42,081 --> 00:29:44,401
Tell her I loved her,
you won't forget?

459
00:29:44,499 --> 00:29:46,717
I won't forget.

460
00:29:46,819 --> 00:29:50,237
- I know you don't like me.
- I like you.

461
00:29:50,339 --> 00:29:52,572
No, you don't.

462
00:29:57,479 --> 00:30:00,980
You were always my favorite
doctor, I thought you should...

463
00:30:19,751 --> 00:30:22,335
It's not bad, I'm fine.

464
00:30:22,437 --> 00:30:25,455
Hey! Stop! Stop moving!

465
00:30:26,391 --> 00:30:28,859
Upper left shoulder.
Through and through.

466
00:30:28,961 --> 00:30:30,154
You're gonna be fine.

467
00:30:30,178 --> 00:30:31,928
That's what I've been
trying to tell you...

468
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:34,125
Don't think about trying
to get off this table.

469
00:30:34,149 --> 00:30:36,077
We need to irrigate,
get antibiotics on board.

470
00:30:36,101 --> 00:30:37,984
Doing work on the shoulder...

471
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:42,756
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm OK.

472
00:30:42,857 --> 00:30:45,225
Are you sure? Oh, my
God! Did you get shot?

473
00:30:45,327 --> 00:30:48,445
No, I didn't get
shot, OK? I'm OK.

474
00:30:48,547 --> 00:30:50,697
You could be in shock and
not know it. Let me feel...

475
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:52,265
I'm...

476
00:30:53,969 --> 00:30:55,635
I'm OK.

477
00:30:57,556 --> 00:30:59,623
There's blood spreading
down your thighs.

478
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:02,759
I'm...

479
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:05,478
I'm having a miscarriage.

480
00:31:07,165 --> 00:31:10,617
We need a stapler, lidocaine,
morphine and irrigation trays.

481
00:31:10,719 --> 00:31:13,079
Come on, are you gonna
help me or not? Let's go.

482
00:31:50,709 --> 00:31:52,275
I've been looking for you.

483
00:31:54,296 --> 00:31:56,577
I've been looking for you.

484
00:32:02,854 --> 00:32:04,755
You wanna know something funny?

485
00:32:06,292 --> 00:32:07,824
Do you?

486
00:32:10,145 --> 00:32:11,795
OK.

487
00:32:12,464 --> 00:32:14,364
Five days ago,

488
00:32:14,466 --> 00:32:16,799
when I bought this gun...

489
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:21,888
Did you know you could
buy a gun at a superstore?

490
00:32:22,957 --> 00:32:26,459
They have a whole
section off of aisle eight.

491
00:32:28,129 --> 00:32:29,629
A gun section.

492
00:32:29,731 --> 00:32:33,165
Anyway, when I bought the gun...

493
00:32:34,569 --> 00:32:36,669
I got all this ammunition.

494
00:32:37,972 --> 00:32:39,206
Ammo.

495
00:32:39,308 --> 00:32:40,890
I bought a whole bunch of it

496
00:32:40,993 --> 00:32:43,126
'cause it was on sale.

497
00:32:44,596 --> 00:32:46,330
And then this morning,

498
00:32:47,716 --> 00:32:50,016
I was packing it into my coat,

499
00:32:51,787 --> 00:32:54,854
I didn't have enough room
for all of it in my pockets...

500
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:57,857
because...

501
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:04,297
I wanted to bring my flask.

502
00:33:09,438 --> 00:33:11,271
You mind?

503
00:33:54,382 --> 00:33:56,199
I'm not much of a drinker...

504
00:33:57,953 --> 00:34:00,536
but I figured I'd need
some liquid courage.

505
00:34:06,595 --> 00:34:07,860
You want some?

506
00:34:13,685 --> 00:34:14,965
No, thanks.

507
00:34:23,595 --> 00:34:25,879
The funny part is,

508
00:34:25,981 --> 00:34:28,148
I didn't need a drink until now.

509
00:34:28,816 --> 00:34:31,351
Right now.

510
00:34:31,453 --> 00:34:34,120
And the only reason I
need a drink is because...

511
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:38,057
I only have one bullet left.

512
00:34:41,229 --> 00:34:44,164
I left bullets at home because
I thought I'd need a drink.

513
00:34:44,266 --> 00:34:49,719
And the only reason I need a drink is
because I don't have enough bullets!

514
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:57,910
See, I was gonna kill you...

515
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,130
shoot you right in the face...

516
00:35:02,617 --> 00:35:04,417
watch you suffer and die.

517
00:35:06,588 --> 00:35:08,921
And then I was
gonna shoot myself.

518
00:35:11,793 --> 00:35:14,244
But I only have one bullet left.

519
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:21,050
Then it seems you
have a bit of a problem.

520
00:35:23,071 --> 00:35:24,621
I do.

521
00:35:25,607 --> 00:35:27,173
I do.

522
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:30,210
I have one hell of a problem.

523
00:35:33,681 --> 00:35:35,348
You sure you don't want a drink?

524
00:35:50,516 --> 00:35:52,282
Vodka.

525
00:35:53,218 --> 00:35:54,634
That's nice.

526
00:36:03,929 --> 00:36:05,562
Hey.

527
00:36:08,266 --> 00:36:10,133
What's it gonna be, Mr. Clark?

528
00:36:12,254 --> 00:36:13,953
Me or you?

529
00:36:17,776 --> 00:36:20,243
You shoot me,
SWAT's gonna get you.

530
00:36:21,013 --> 00:36:22,293
And they're not gonna shoot you.

531
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:25,949
They're gonna capture
you and take you to prison.

532
00:36:26,051 --> 00:36:29,886
You shoot yourself,
then you're free.

533
00:36:29,988 --> 00:36:31,921
Done.

534
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:34,183
Maybe you get to
see your wife again.

535
00:36:35,376 --> 00:36:37,143
So you have a choice to make.

536
00:36:38,913 --> 00:36:40,180
Me or you?

537
00:36:41,333 --> 00:36:43,166
A life in prison?

538
00:36:44,802 --> 00:36:46,802
Or an afterlife with your wife?

539
00:36:50,675 --> 00:36:52,642
- Screw you.
- I've lived.

540
00:36:52,744 --> 00:36:56,179
I mean, I've
really, really lived.

541
00:36:56,281 --> 00:36:59,565
I've failed, I've
been devastated.

542
00:36:59,668 --> 00:37:01,151
I've been broken.

543
00:37:01,253 --> 00:37:03,352
I've gone to hell and back.

544
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:06,756
And I've also known joy,

545
00:37:06,858 --> 00:37:08,875
and passion.

546
00:37:09,978 --> 00:37:11,861
And I've had a great love.

547
00:37:14,816 --> 00:37:17,784
See, death for me,

548
00:37:17,886 --> 00:37:19,635
is not justice.

549
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:24,840
It's the end of a
beautiful journey.

550
00:37:28,446 --> 00:37:30,380
And I'm not afraid to die.

551
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,582
The question is...

552
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:36,085
are you?

553
00:37:37,522 --> 00:37:39,222
A life in prison...

554
00:37:40,458 --> 00:37:42,325
or an afterlife...

555
00:37:43,028 --> 00:37:44,493
with your wife.

556
00:37:47,815 --> 00:37:49,349
Me or you.

557
00:37:51,869 --> 00:37:53,403
Your choice.

558
00:37:56,007 --> 00:37:57,540
<i>Yes or no.</i>

559
00:38:00,312 --> 00:38:01,811
<i>In or out.</i>

560
00:38:03,815 --> 00:38:05,415
<i>Up or down.</i>

561
00:38:21,199 --> 00:38:24,679
OK, I'm almost done, just
finishing up the pericardial repair.

562
00:38:29,057 --> 00:38:31,808
- V-fib!
- Oh, no.

563
00:39:03,191 --> 00:39:05,808
- Give me the internal paddles!
- Give me one of epi.

564
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:07,893
- April, you got it?
- Yep.

565
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,880
Charge to 50.

566
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:13,349
Clear!

567
00:39:14,986 --> 00:39:16,752
- Bill?
- Mary?

568
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:18,687
Mary!

569
00:39:22,894 --> 00:39:24,460
Are you OK?

570
00:39:30,168 --> 00:39:33,202
What was the name again?
Tell me. Dr. Reed who?

571
00:39:34,488 --> 00:39:35,672
Epi going in.

572
00:39:35,774 --> 00:39:37,056
Charge again to 50.

573
00:39:37,492 --> 00:39:39,008
Clear.

574
00:39:51,757 --> 00:39:54,724
I'm gonna go see if kids
need help finding their parents.

575
00:39:55,527 --> 00:39:56,810
People died.

576
00:39:57,846 --> 00:39:59,312
People are dead.

577
00:39:59,414 --> 00:40:02,247
I don't want to have kids if
it means I can't be with you.

578
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:07,620
No, no.

579
00:40:09,557 --> 00:40:12,926
We'll have kids. We'll
have all kinds of kids.

580
00:40:13,028 --> 00:40:16,762
And I always thought that I
wasn't cut out to be a mom, but...

581
00:40:16,864 --> 00:40:19,615
you'll be a great mom,
you'll be an amazing mom.

582
00:40:19,717 --> 00:40:22,652
And I love you so much,

583
00:40:22,754 --> 00:40:24,820
and I can't live without
you and our ten kids...

584
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:44,707
- We got him.
- Oh!

585
00:40:47,996 --> 00:40:49,813
We got him.

586
00:41:06,848 --> 00:41:08,581
<i>Live or die.</i>

587
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:14,169
<i>Hero or coward.</i>

588
00:41:15,406 --> 00:41:17,356
<i>Fight or give in.</i>

589
00:41:24,182 --> 00:41:26,783
<i>I'll say it again to
make sure you hear me:</i>

590
00:41:26,885 --> 00:41:30,186
<i>The human life is
made up of choices.</i>

591
00:41:33,792 --> 00:41:35,692
<i>Live or die.</i>

592
00:41:38,597 --> 00:41:40,363
<i>That's the important choice.</i>

593
00:41:48,289 --> 00:41:50,089
- Mer!
- Huh?

594
00:41:50,191 --> 00:41:51,857
Derek's asking for you.

595
00:41:53,028 --> 00:41:54,244
OK.

596
00:42:09,894 --> 00:42:11,560
<i>And it's not always...</i>

597
00:42:14,833 --> 00:42:16,398
<i>in our hands.</i>
