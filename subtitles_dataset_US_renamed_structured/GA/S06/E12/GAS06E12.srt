1
00:00:03,937 --> 00:00:08,040
<i>Number one rule of
surgery is limit exposure.</i>

2
00:00:08,142 --> 00:00:09,174
Good.

3
00:00:09,276 --> 00:00:13,478
<i>Keep your hands clean,
your incisions small</i>

4
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:16,397
<i>and your wounds covered.</i>

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,185
I've removed the tumor
and placed the catheters.

6
00:00:20,287 --> 00:00:23,872
Now, I'm going to flood the
abdomen with heated chemo.

7
00:00:23,974 --> 00:00:26,941
It allows a greater
concentration of drugs

8
00:00:27,043 --> 00:00:29,494
to be delivered directly
to the affected area,

9
00:00:29,597 --> 00:00:32,046
and the heat helps
target the cancer cells

10
00:00:32,149 --> 00:00:34,883
while leaving the normal
cells virtually unaffected.

11
00:00:34,985 --> 00:00:37,652
OK, start perfusion.

12
00:00:37,754 --> 00:00:40,455
OK. We'll place him
in Trendelenburg,

13
00:00:40,557 --> 00:00:43,091
then reverse Trendelenburg

14
00:00:43,193 --> 00:00:47,646
as we agitate the abdomen
to make sure that the chemo

15
00:00:47,748 --> 00:00:50,732
really washes everywhere.

16
00:00:52,035 --> 00:00:55,587
- OK, she saw me. Now I can go.
- She's just getting started.

17
00:00:55,689 --> 00:00:57,723
I have a headache.
I need coffee.

18
00:00:59,793 --> 00:01:04,112
I have a cure for a headache
that doesn't involve coffee.

19
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:11,286
- I'm leaving. There's a seat there.
- Thanks.

20
00:01:17,044 --> 00:01:19,978
OK. Ooh, yeah.

21
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,480
I've never seen a hot
chemo lavage before.

22
00:01:22,566 --> 00:01:25,967
- It's fascinating.
- I thought you were leaving.

23
00:01:26,069 --> 00:01:28,453
The chief asked me to
finish out my contract,

24
00:01:28,555 --> 00:01:30,922
which has a few more weeks.

25
00:01:31,024 --> 00:01:32,890
<i>Number two rule of surgery</i>

26
00:01:32,993 --> 00:01:37,896
<i>is when rule number one stops
working, try something else.</i>

27
00:01:37,998 --> 00:01:39,748
What I said I didn't mean.

28
00:01:41,502 --> 00:01:45,236
You mean offering to trade Owen
like a horse or a baseball card

29
00:01:45,339 --> 00:01:48,140
or a stale peanut butter
sandwich from your lunchbox.

30
00:01:48,242 --> 00:01:50,526
It was...

31
00:01:53,647 --> 00:01:57,366
- It was thoughtless.
- Fine.

32
00:01:57,468 --> 00:02:01,386
Fine. Cristina, let's
just forget about it.

33
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:05,073
<i>Because sometimes,
you can't limit exposure.</i>

34
00:02:05,175 --> 00:02:08,710
<i>Sometimes, the injury is so bad</i>

35
00:02:08,812 --> 00:02:11,279
<i>you have to cut and cut big.</i>

36
00:02:11,382 --> 00:02:12,592
- No!
- Yes!

37
00:02:12,616 --> 00:02:14,511
- No! If you report him...
- He's an alcoholic!

38
00:02:14,535 --> 00:02:16,975
If you report him, it'll
be the end of his career!

39
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:18,620
You don't give people any room!

40
00:02:18,722 --> 00:02:20,366
Flaws are unacceptable
to McDreamy.

41
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:23,091
- Don't McDreamy me.
- McDreamy is being a McAss!

42
00:02:23,193 --> 00:02:26,862
He's an alcoholic! How long has he
been drinking? Since the holidays?

43
00:02:26,964 --> 00:02:29,084
You want to take notes so
you can show it to the board

44
00:02:29,116 --> 00:02:30,560
so they can offer you his job?

45
00:02:30,584 --> 00:02:32,729
You want his job. You
know it, and I know it.

46
00:02:32,753 --> 00:02:35,553
I'm the head of neurosurgery. I
have a responsibility to this hospital.

47
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:39,274
- Admit you want to be chief.
- I'm done having this argument.

48
00:02:39,376 --> 00:02:41,793
I'm going to the board,
I'm reporting Richard.

49
00:02:41,895 --> 00:02:44,613
Post-it!

50
00:02:44,715 --> 00:02:47,148
- You can't call Post-it.
- I am calling Post-it.

51
00:02:47,251 --> 00:02:50,518
Because I told my secret
about my friend to my husband,

52
00:02:50,621 --> 00:02:53,555
not the head of
neurosurgery. My husband.

53
00:02:53,657 --> 00:02:55,540
Which I have to be able to do.

54
00:02:55,642 --> 00:02:58,160
So the laws of
Post-it clearly prevail.

55
00:02:58,262 --> 00:02:59,505
- This is wrong.
- Post-it.

56
00:02:59,529 --> 00:03:01,229
- The chief...
- Post-it!

57
00:03:04,585 --> 00:03:06,318
Fine. I won't tell.

58
00:03:07,504 --> 00:03:09,338
Fine.

59
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:13,559
Damn it, you just
make me want to...

60
00:03:27,341 --> 00:03:30,509
Izzie's coming home.
I have to tell Alex.

61
00:03:32,612 --> 00:03:34,612
I won't go to the board.

62
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:36,731
I won't say a word.

63
00:03:38,935 --> 00:03:40,552
Just think about what I said.

64
00:03:41,455 --> 00:03:42,937
OK.

65
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:50,329
- Alex, Izzie's coming...
- Izzie's coming?

66
00:03:50,431 --> 00:03:52,431
- Home.
- Crap!

67
00:03:53,717 --> 00:03:55,350
Izzie leaves and
Mark gets a kid,

68
00:03:55,452 --> 00:03:57,285
and you two decide
the best way to deal

69
00:03:57,387 --> 00:03:59,654
is to get drunk and mash
your genitals together?

70
00:03:59,756 --> 00:04:02,807
No freaking way you get to
judge us or give relationship advice.

71
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:05,088
Besides, you were a total dirty
mistress, like, two weeks ago.

72
00:04:05,112 --> 00:04:08,363
- Are we calling me
a dirty mistress?
- That was two years ago.

73
00:04:08,465 --> 00:04:10,499
And his wife didn't have cancer!

74
00:04:10,601 --> 00:04:13,368
Because I've only been with,
like, six guys in my whole life.

75
00:04:13,486 --> 00:04:17,121
Alex and I, we've done
it before. I was recycling.

76
00:04:17,223 --> 00:04:19,068
It was like good
for the environment.

77
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,093
Izzie's gone, I was
horny, she was there.

78
00:04:21,195 --> 00:04:23,005
Crap! I am a dirty mistress.

79
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:24,474
Oh, God, you're gonna tell Derek

80
00:04:24,498 --> 00:04:26,343
and Derek will tell
Mark that I'm a whore!

81
00:04:26,367 --> 00:04:29,734
No, I am not going to tell
Derek, and neither are you.

82
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:33,755
You're not gonna say anything.
We are keeping our mouths shut.

83
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:37,092
Izzie is coming home.
No one needs to know.

84
00:04:38,262 --> 00:04:39,542
Hi.

85
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:42,146
Know what?

86
00:04:48,739 --> 00:04:50,917
There were no sterile
supplies in the OR last night.

87
00:04:50,941 --> 00:04:53,052
- I heard.
- Surgery came
to a complete stop

88
00:04:53,076 --> 00:04:55,510
- for a full hour.
- Central Supply and Maintenance

89
00:04:55,612 --> 00:04:58,162
are understaffed and the
autoclaves have been breaking down.

90
00:04:58,264 --> 00:05:00,415
Anything else?

91
00:05:02,786 --> 00:05:04,586
Richard...

92
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:09,675
- I want to help.
- I don't need your help, Derek.

93
00:05:09,777 --> 00:05:12,310
The sterilizers are
up and running, so...

94
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:15,930
Not the hospital. You.

95
00:05:17,084 --> 00:05:19,634
You stopped operating.

96
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:22,270
You're not teaching
anybody but Meredith.

97
00:05:23,306 --> 00:05:25,540
I'm wondering if...

98
00:05:28,211 --> 00:05:30,094
If you need some help.

99
00:05:31,165 --> 00:05:33,525
No shame in asking.
You know that.

100
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,172
You can help.

101
00:05:43,293 --> 00:05:47,979
By doing your own job.
And letting me do mine.

102
00:05:49,632 --> 00:05:52,150
- Anything else?
- No.

103
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:54,986
I'm done.

104
00:06:01,044 --> 00:06:03,461
So I went to the trailer.

105
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:07,398
- I don't live in the
trailer anymore.
- Yeah.

106
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:13,371
So...

107
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:15,973
Meredith called me and told
me you might be moving on.

108
00:06:16,059 --> 00:06:18,559
- Iz...
- OK, just...

109
00:06:18,661 --> 00:06:21,112
Wait. I realize now

110
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:24,983
I was wrong to blame
you for getting fired.

111
00:06:25,085 --> 00:06:26,418
I'm sorry. It wasn't your fault.

112
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:30,305
I don't wanna have some
big talk. I gotta go to work.

113
00:06:33,877 --> 00:06:35,071
I have a PET scan later,

114
00:06:35,095 --> 00:06:37,295
so maybe I'll see
you at the hospital?

115
00:06:37,398 --> 00:06:38,838
- Is everything OK?
- Yeah.

116
00:06:38,932 --> 00:06:42,333
I found some residencies
with open spots and applied.

117
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:44,936
They all just want to
make sure I'm stable.

118
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:48,790
One of them is close.

119
00:06:48,892 --> 00:06:51,126
It's in Tacoma, so...

120
00:06:51,228 --> 00:06:52,844
we'd be OK.

121
00:06:52,946 --> 00:06:56,180
I could commute
from here, and...

122
00:06:56,282 --> 00:06:58,883
I know you don't want to
have some big talk, but...

123
00:06:58,985 --> 00:07:00,368
I have to get to the hospital.

124
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:01,853
That place sucks these days.

125
00:07:01,955 --> 00:07:04,572
You should be happy you
don't work there anymore.

126
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:06,224
Hmm.

127
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:09,160
- Sorry.
- Don't be.

128
00:07:09,246 --> 00:07:11,007
I am happy. I'm
gonna work in Tacoma,

129
00:07:11,031 --> 00:07:14,683
and it's gonna be awesome.
You're gonna be jealous.

130
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:21,639
- You're operating?
- I am.

131
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:23,024
A Whipple? That's big.

132
00:07:23,126 --> 00:07:27,612
I say go big... or go home.

133
00:07:30,884 --> 00:07:34,369
Uh... Excuse me, sir? You're
taking Dr. Bailey's Whipple?

134
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:36,420
- Is that a problem?
- No, not at all.

135
00:07:36,523 --> 00:07:40,508
No, I'm the resident on the case.
I'm thrilled to be assisting you.

136
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:43,611
- I'll be assisting you, right?
- You can open.

137
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:46,631
That way Dr. Grey will be
fresh when she dissects the neck

138
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:48,973
of the pancreas
from the portal vein.

139
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:52,671
- That's the hardest part.
- It's a fifth-year procedure.

140
00:07:52,773 --> 00:07:55,857
It's what we've been practicing.
I'm telling you, you're ready.

141
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:58,727
But if you don't
think you're ready...

142
00:07:58,829 --> 00:08:00,795
No, I'm ready. I'm ready.

143
00:08:04,367 --> 00:08:07,702
- What's going on?
- Hunt's got an MVC in here.

144
00:08:09,105 --> 00:08:10,638
- Use a hand?
- What?

145
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,491
- Can I help?
- You know what
you can do first?

146
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:15,443
Make that stop!

147
00:08:21,151 --> 00:08:22,884
Dude, stop singing!

148
00:08:22,986 --> 00:08:26,037
I'm trying to get you to understand
the seriousness of the problem.

149
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:28,489
I've lost my upper
register completely.

150
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:31,526
Dr. Karev, this is
Mr. Mafrici, your consult.

151
00:08:31,628 --> 00:08:35,563
I just need some antibiotics.
I open in<i> Tosca</i> in a week.

152
00:08:35,665 --> 00:08:39,217
- And he gave me bronchitis.
- I did not give this to you.

153
00:08:39,319 --> 00:08:40,719
Take a deep breath.

154
00:08:41,722 --> 00:08:43,805
He teaches piano to children.

155
00:08:43,907 --> 00:08:46,024
I can hear them hacking
away during their lessons,

156
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:48,166
and then he comes in the
house and touches things.

157
00:08:48,245 --> 00:08:50,912
Stop talking. He's got decreased
breath sounds on the left side.

158
00:08:51,014 --> 00:08:52,541
- He needs an X-ray.
- Can you take him?

159
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:55,350
Page an intern.
I don't have time.

160
00:08:58,088 --> 00:09:00,788
Hunt took him up. Said
thanks for your help.

161
00:09:02,391 --> 00:09:04,425
You got time now?

162
00:09:18,942 --> 00:09:21,325
- You're hot.
- You're hot, too.

163
00:09:21,428 --> 00:09:25,079
No, you're "hot" hot.

164
00:09:25,181 --> 00:09:26,447
Oh, OK. Thanks.

165
00:09:26,549 --> 00:09:30,452
No, you have a fever.
You have a fever.

166
00:09:30,554 --> 00:09:32,253
- What is that?
- What?

167
00:09:32,355 --> 00:09:33,972
- Oh, my God!
- What?

168
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:38,610
Pox! Pox! You have chicken pox!

169
00:09:42,682 --> 00:09:45,216
Teddy. Turns out she loves Owen

170
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:47,852
and thought she came here to
be all, you know, Teddy and Owen,

171
00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:50,655
but there's me, and now she's
pained and threatening to leave,

172
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:52,807
so I told her she
could have him.

173
00:09:52,909 --> 00:09:54,875
- What?
- She's an amazing teacher.

174
00:09:54,977 --> 00:09:58,112
And I'm happy again.
And I'm in the OR,

175
00:09:58,214 --> 00:09:59,364
and I'm feeling like myself.

176
00:09:59,466 --> 00:10:01,232
And, of course,
I didn't mean it.

177
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:03,050
I mean, I love Owen. I love him.

178
00:10:03,152 --> 00:10:05,986
But that means I don't
get to have her. So...

179
00:10:07,156 --> 00:10:08,322
Maybe I meant it?

180
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:12,560
OK, here's the thing.
You can't talk like this.

181
00:10:12,662 --> 00:10:14,863
- It's like, I get you.
- Yeah.

182
00:10:14,965 --> 00:10:17,782
But other people don't.
So you can't talk like this.

183
00:10:17,884 --> 00:10:20,165
I mean, it's crazy. It's like...

184
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:22,587
if you tell someone
their baby is ugly.

185
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:23,900
They know it, you know it.

186
00:10:23,924 --> 00:10:26,724
Everybody knows it.
But you don't talk about it.

187
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:28,994
OK, but you're
saying surgery, right?

188
00:10:29,096 --> 00:10:31,162
Gun to your head, you'd
choose surgery over Derek.

189
00:10:31,264 --> 00:10:35,516
I'm saying don't talk about
this. Don't talk about it to Owen.

190
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:44,220
Little Grey? That's the world-class
specialist you wanted me to see?

191
00:10:44,244 --> 00:10:46,577
OK, Little Grey has had
the chicken pox vaccine.

192
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:49,814
I snooped in your personnel
file. I, on the other hand, have not.

193
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:51,399
Nor have I ever
had them as a child.

194
00:10:51,501 --> 00:10:52,717
You're a pediatrician.

195
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:54,730
- How have you never had...?
- I'm a pediatric surgeon.

196
00:10:54,754 --> 00:10:56,431
I don't do little
diseases on little people.

197
00:10:56,455 --> 00:10:58,623
I do big surgeries
on little people.

198
00:10:58,725 --> 00:11:01,459
You know what? This is
ridiculous. I'm going home.

199
00:11:01,561 --> 00:11:02,593
Hey, hey, hey!

200
00:11:02,695 --> 00:11:04,762
You're not going anywhere.

201
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:06,264
You're highly contagious now.

202
00:11:06,349 --> 00:11:09,033
You leave this room and touch
doorknobs, elevator buttons.

203
00:11:09,135 --> 00:11:10,868
Then you'll be the
outbreak monkey.

204
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:14,622
- I'm going to kill you.
- I love you.

205
00:11:14,724 --> 00:11:17,358
Stop scratching. You're
just gonna make it worse.

206
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,160
And then you're gonna scar.

207
00:11:21,064 --> 00:11:23,530
I gotta get my hands
in a body again, Mer.

208
00:11:23,633 --> 00:11:26,551
I think I'm gonna get
an offer from Oregon,

209
00:11:26,653 --> 00:11:29,420
but I can't take it. It's too
far. I can't do that to Alex.

210
00:11:29,523 --> 00:11:32,740
I gotta get this Tacoma thing.
You know what would help?

211
00:11:32,842 --> 00:11:35,226
A call from Derek Shepherd,
head of neurosurgery.

212
00:11:35,328 --> 00:11:38,129
- Hey.
- Hi. Talk to him.

213
00:11:38,231 --> 00:11:41,465
- Talk to me about what?
- She's up for a job in Tacoma.

214
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:44,313
- She wants you to call.
- Tacoma isn't ranked
in the top 20.

215
00:11:44,337 --> 00:11:46,771
Yeah, but it's close. She
can repair things with Alex.

216
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:49,640
Fine. Have her get me the
number. I read the board.

217
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:52,861
The chief is doing a Whipple,
and you're scrubbing in.

218
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,431
Well, you can stop
worrying. He's fine.

219
00:11:56,532 --> 00:11:59,234
He hasn't operated in months,
and his first surgery back

220
00:11:59,336 --> 00:12:04,488
is a seven-hour procedure with
a 20 percent complication rate.

221
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:07,191
First, you were worried
that he wasn't operating.

222
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:11,662
- Now, you're pissed he is...?
- I don't trust him anymore.

223
00:12:11,765 --> 00:12:14,198
- Meredith?
- Post-it.

224
00:12:25,294 --> 00:12:27,862
He's fine. He's fine.

225
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:31,732
I thought it was infection.
Right? Like pneumonia?

226
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:34,735
- That's one of
the possibilities.
- What are the others?

227
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:36,082
Fluid could also indicate...

228
00:12:36,106 --> 00:12:40,091
Yang. Karev made the
diagnosis. Let him talk.

229
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:45,663
Heart failure and cancer could
also cause this much fluid to occur.

230
00:12:45,766 --> 00:12:48,699
Cancer? Would you
have to remove my lung?

231
00:12:48,802 --> 00:12:50,968
Aaron, he just said
cancer is only a possibility.

232
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:56,207
- I sing. It's my entire life.
- Besides me.

233
00:12:56,309 --> 00:13:01,445
What you meant to say was that
singing was your entire life, besides me.

234
00:13:04,967 --> 00:13:07,835
You heard the chief
is operating today?

235
00:13:07,937 --> 00:13:09,153
Uh-huh.

236
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:13,508
Took my Whipple and
is having Meredith Grey

237
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:15,693
do the pancreatic dissection.

238
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:19,980
A procedure that I performed
for the first time just last year.

239
00:13:21,117 --> 00:13:24,118
The chief's judgment...

240
00:13:26,623 --> 00:13:30,191
is not clear and rational.

241
00:13:31,778 --> 00:13:35,162
- There's nothing I can do.
- You're the only one who can.

242
00:13:38,535 --> 00:13:43,954
I performed intraperitoneal
hyperthermic chemo this morning.

243
00:13:44,057 --> 00:13:46,335
I kept looking
up into the gallery

244
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:48,493
to see if the chief was there.

245
00:13:49,646 --> 00:13:52,080
That was a big deal for me.

246
00:13:52,181 --> 00:13:54,916
Anyway, he wasn't there.

247
00:13:55,018 --> 00:13:57,752
And I don't know why I
thought he would show

248
00:13:57,854 --> 00:14:00,405
because the truth is...

249
00:14:03,109 --> 00:14:04,658
he's gone.

250
00:14:07,363 --> 00:14:09,764
And he's been gone a long time.

251
00:14:27,133 --> 00:14:30,401
Arizona thought some work might
take your mind off your itching.

252
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:33,754
Scratching will take
my mind off itching.

253
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,423
Take off my gauze paws.

254
00:14:36,525 --> 00:14:39,260
She said that you'd say
that and that I should say no.

255
00:14:39,362 --> 00:14:43,398
So how about we start with the
tibial plateau fracture, room 2240?

256
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,383
Hey, hey.

257
00:14:46,485 --> 00:14:48,219
I'm an attending,
you're a resident.

258
00:14:48,321 --> 00:14:52,439
As your superior, I'm
ordering you to take them off!

259
00:14:52,542 --> 00:14:53,708
She said you'd say that too.

260
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:55,654
Technically, I'm on
her service today,

261
00:14:55,678 --> 00:14:57,311
so she's my boss, not you.

262
00:14:57,413 --> 00:15:00,831
We have the Lisfranc
fracture, room 2211.

263
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:04,051
Please, let me scratch!
Just for five minutes.

264
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:05,597
- It'll scar.
- I don't care!

265
00:15:05,621 --> 00:15:07,888
I don't care. Scars are hot.

266
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:11,292
Scars are bad-ass.
Scars are poetic.

267
00:15:11,394 --> 00:15:13,077
- I am begging you, Little Grey.
- No.

268
00:15:13,179 --> 00:15:16,163
- Please don't call me
Little Grey.
- I'm in pain!

269
00:15:16,265 --> 00:15:19,933
Down to the core of my being
pain, I'm going crazy pain,

270
00:15:20,036 --> 00:15:23,087
scary, "will this
ever go away" pain.

271
00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:26,841
Do you get that? Do you know
what I mean when I say that?

272
00:15:26,943 --> 00:15:32,079
Because this pain is need to
scratch an itch that I can't scratch!

273
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:35,750
The pain of a thousand
itches! And it's making me crazy!

274
00:15:35,852 --> 00:15:38,886
Not funny crazy, bad
crazy! OK? Dark crazy.

275
00:15:38,988 --> 00:15:40,988
Make a suit out of someone
else's skin crazy. OK?

276
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:44,708
- Pain, Little Grey. Pain!
- I had sex with Alex!

277
00:15:44,794 --> 00:15:49,296
I had sex with Alex.
Which I regret. Completely.

278
00:15:49,398 --> 00:15:51,877
Because I'm in love
with Mark. I think.

279
00:15:51,901 --> 00:15:53,529
I'm scared I can't
handle the daughter

280
00:15:53,553 --> 00:15:54,885
and the baby and the Mark's

281
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:58,522
- gonna be a grandpa thing.
- Why are you telling me this?

282
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:01,225
I'm in pain, too,
is what I'm saying.

283
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:03,255
I get your pain,
don't you see that?

284
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:05,639
I do feel your pain
because I'm in pain too.

285
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:11,001
I have pox between
my butt cheeks.

286
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:14,005
Your "pain" does not
begin to compare to mine.

287
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:16,424
Get out! Just out!

288
00:16:16,526 --> 00:16:19,009
Out, out, out, out, out!

289
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:21,245
- What are you talking about?
- She's on this thing.

290
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:24,181
If you had to choose between
the thing you love, surgery,

291
00:16:24,283 --> 00:16:26,166
and the person you love,
which would you choose?

292
00:16:26,269 --> 00:16:29,520
You would choose Izzie, right?
Because you're gonna get back together.

293
00:16:29,605 --> 00:16:31,082
- Shut up.
- Why do you have to choose?

294
00:16:31,106 --> 00:16:33,808
Doesn't matter. You just do.
Which is it, surgery or love?

295
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,421
- I want both.
- That's what I said.

296
00:16:35,445 --> 00:16:37,645
- You can't have both.
- Why the hell not?

297
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:39,591
- Why the hell is he here?
- I said he could be in here

298
00:16:39,615 --> 00:16:41,227
because he's in
the Whipple, too.

299
00:16:41,251 --> 00:16:45,403
Whatever. Once again, you cannot
have both. You have to choose.

300
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:47,020
Choose what?

301
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:55,729
My... My PET scan got
pushed back an hour.

302
00:16:55,831 --> 00:16:58,532
So I thought I'd
join you for lunch.

303
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:03,270
OK? That. You
have to give up that.

304
00:17:03,372 --> 00:17:06,974
Learning the procedure, tuning
out the world until you get it,

305
00:17:07,076 --> 00:17:08,609
like, you know,
doing the procedure

306
00:17:08,711 --> 00:17:09,951
is the only thing that matters.

307
00:17:10,012 --> 00:17:11,662
If you don't get
to do it, you'll die.

308
00:17:11,765 --> 00:17:12,925
That's what you have to give up.

309
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:16,216
- For what?
- Love.

310
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,152
- Why?
- That's what I said.

311
00:17:18,254 --> 00:17:20,535
That's not the point! You
know you couldn't do it.

312
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:22,234
You know you'd
choose a procedure.

313
00:17:22,258 --> 00:17:25,209
Fine, if I had to choose, gun to
my head, I would choose surgery.

314
00:17:25,311 --> 00:17:28,062
OK, well, thank you!
Is that so hard to say?

315
00:17:28,164 --> 00:17:30,158
I don't know why is it so
bad to say that out loud.

316
00:17:30,182 --> 00:17:31,465
Because it's crazy.

317
00:17:33,369 --> 00:17:34,779
- How...?
- It's crazy.

318
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:37,371
Surgery, it's just a job.

319
00:17:37,474 --> 00:17:40,107
It's just a job. It's the
thing you come home from,

320
00:17:40,209 --> 00:17:41,449
not the thing you come home to.

321
00:17:41,544 --> 00:17:44,228
And if you lose your
job, you get another one.

322
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:47,364
'Cause there's always
another one. But...

323
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:50,434
if you lose your love...

324
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:52,903
if you think you're
losing your love...

325
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:56,156
then suddenly
nothing else matters.

326
00:17:59,762 --> 00:18:02,046
This is what you guys
talk about during lunch?

327
00:18:02,148 --> 00:18:03,830
I'm with them.

328
00:18:03,932 --> 00:18:06,400
Love comes and goes.

329
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:09,487
Surgery doesn't.

330
00:18:15,328 --> 00:18:16,828
Results are back.

331
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:25,819
- You choose love.
- Yes! I just did

332
00:18:25,921 --> 00:18:28,283
a perfect dissection without
lacerating the portal vein.

333
00:18:28,307 --> 00:18:30,824
You gonna do that little
fist pump in surgery too?

334
00:18:33,913 --> 00:18:36,380
The tests showed a
malignancy on your left lung.

335
00:18:36,483 --> 00:18:37,993
It's called pleural
mesothelioma,

336
00:18:38,017 --> 00:18:39,979
and it's a cancer that surrounds

337
00:18:40,003 --> 00:18:42,053
- the lining of your lung.
- So what?

338
00:18:42,155 --> 00:18:44,404
- You cut out his lung?
- Best case scenario,

339
00:18:44,506 --> 00:18:46,841
we won't have to remove any
lung tissue except the tumor.

340
00:18:46,943 --> 00:18:48,837
Aaron, did you hear
that? That's good.

341
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:52,246
Jeffrey, I'm not deaf. What's
the worst case scenario?

342
00:18:52,348 --> 00:18:54,682
We get in there and the
damage is too extensive

343
00:18:54,784 --> 00:18:56,049
and we have to remove more.

344
00:18:56,169 --> 00:18:59,203
- My whole lung?
- That's the
worst case scenario.

345
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:01,922
But yes, it is a possibility.

346
00:19:02,024 --> 00:19:04,809
But it's also possible they
won't have to remove any.

347
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:07,477
- OK? So let's stay positive.
- Will you please shut up?

348
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:10,064
I can't take your cheerful
little voice shoving

349
00:19:10,183 --> 00:19:14,252
positive thinking down my throat
when my life is basically over.

350
00:19:14,354 --> 00:19:17,972
People do recover from things
like this, then they go on to...

351
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:21,275
- What? Go on to what?
- Live.

352
00:19:21,377 --> 00:19:24,812
I won't have a
lung. I'm a singer.

353
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:26,513
So you see my problem?

354
00:19:26,616 --> 00:19:30,050
- You can direct, you can teach.
- Like you?

355
00:19:30,152 --> 00:19:33,420
I'd rather die than spend
two hours every day listening

356
00:19:33,522 --> 00:19:36,607
to mediocre music
majors doing their scales.

357
00:19:36,709 --> 00:19:39,943
I know this is a lot to take
in, and if you need time to talk

358
00:19:40,046 --> 00:19:43,213
- or get a second opinion...
- I want my lung.

359
00:19:47,303 --> 00:19:49,002
Dr. Altman.

360
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:52,823
I'm big, too big.

361
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:56,176
I don't fit in airplane seats,
and as Jeff's always telling me,

362
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:59,613
my feelings don't
always fit the situation.

363
00:19:59,715 --> 00:20:02,149
If my food is overcooked
in a restaurant,

364
00:20:02,251 --> 00:20:07,237
I get enraged. I
want to kill the waiter.

365
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:10,757
But I don't. I politely ask
him to take my meal back

366
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:13,928
and bring it to me
the way I asked for it.

367
00:20:14,029 --> 00:20:19,950
I spend my days making
myself smaller, more acceptable.

368
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:22,920
And that's OK because at night,

369
00:20:23,022 --> 00:20:26,173
when I go onstage, I get
to experience the world

370
00:20:26,275 --> 00:20:28,192
the way I feel it.

371
00:20:28,294 --> 00:20:33,531
With indescribable rage
and unbearable sadness

372
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:35,265
and huge passion.

373
00:20:36,352 --> 00:20:38,552
At night, onstage,

374
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:41,756
I get to kill the waiter
and dance on his grave.

375
00:20:42,942 --> 00:20:48,012
And if I can't do
that, if all I have left

376
00:20:48,114 --> 00:20:50,881
is a life of making
myself smaller...

377
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:53,884
then I don't want to live.

378
00:20:55,471 --> 00:20:57,170
I don't.

379
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:02,292
And believe me, honey,
you don't want me to live.

380
00:21:23,533 --> 00:21:26,267
Are you stealing
sterile supplies?

381
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:29,019
I need sterile instruments.

382
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:31,021
I'm not gonna get caught
with my pants down

383
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:33,607
because this
hospital can't get...

384
00:21:34,476 --> 00:21:35,809
I get it.

385
00:21:38,113 --> 00:21:39,396
I wanna do something.

386
00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:43,900
Something that I think is...

387
00:21:46,255 --> 00:21:50,357
I have a responsibility,
but I just...

388
00:21:50,459 --> 00:21:52,137
- What's stopping you?
- Meredith.

389
00:21:52,161 --> 00:21:53,794
Ah!

390
00:21:53,896 --> 00:21:55,929
The other half of
the twisted sisters.

391
00:21:56,031 --> 00:21:57,726
Is that what you call
Meredith and Cristina?

392
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:00,534
- The twisted sisters?
- Yeah.

393
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:03,070
Well, that fits.

394
00:22:06,876 --> 00:22:10,777
So this... this thing...

395
00:22:13,966 --> 00:22:16,333
I could come
out of it looking...

396
00:22:17,603 --> 00:22:19,420
pretty bad.

397
00:22:19,522 --> 00:22:23,040
Like I did it for the wrong
reasons. Like I did it...

398
00:22:23,142 --> 00:22:24,941
for myself.

399
00:22:28,947 --> 00:22:31,215
In my experience,
nobody goes into a battle

400
00:22:31,317 --> 00:22:33,400
because they want
to win a Purple Heart.

401
00:22:33,502 --> 00:22:36,236
You do the right thing, and
sometimes that gets you a medal.

402
00:22:36,338 --> 00:22:39,256
Sometimes, it gets you killed.

403
00:22:39,341 --> 00:22:41,658
How do you know
it's the right thing?

404
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,812
When it's the best
thing for the most people.

405
00:22:44,914 --> 00:22:48,849
The thing that keeps
the most people alive.

406
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:56,289
How you doing?

407
00:22:56,391 --> 00:22:58,208
A little claustrophobic.

408
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:00,877
Focus on your breathing,
that always helps.

409
00:23:07,586 --> 00:23:09,987
Alex, I have to know.

410
00:23:10,089 --> 00:23:13,690
When Mer called, she said
you were moving on. Have you?

411
00:23:13,793 --> 00:23:15,409
Moved on?

412
00:23:19,698 --> 00:23:21,264
I slept with someone.

413
00:23:23,585 --> 00:23:25,552
Damn it, Alex.

414
00:23:27,456 --> 00:23:29,323
We'll get through it.

415
00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:36,680
- Are you still there?
- I'm right here.

416
00:23:36,783 --> 00:23:39,623
Can you hold my hand or
something so I know you haven't left?

417
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:41,919
I can't reach your hand.

418
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:46,791
- Oh, yeah.
- I can hold your foot.

419
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:49,577
A foot is good.

420
00:24:02,091 --> 00:24:05,959
Look, Derek, I'm busy. I have
a surgery in less than an hour.

421
00:24:42,782 --> 00:24:44,414
You want me to drink that?

422
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:47,250
No.

423
00:24:48,788 --> 00:24:50,120
But I believe you will.

424
00:24:50,222 --> 00:24:53,056
I'm gonna go, and
you're gonna drink it.

425
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:58,112
You're gonna try not to.
But, in the end, you'll drink it.

426
00:25:01,984 --> 00:25:04,418
I also believe that this

427
00:25:04,519 --> 00:25:06,854
won't be the first
drink you drank today.

428
00:25:25,725 --> 00:25:28,692
This tumor is huge. I've
never seen pleura this thick.

429
00:25:28,794 --> 00:25:30,861
- Like a watermelon rind.
- Damn it.

430
00:25:30,963 --> 00:25:34,164
I'm gonna have to get rid of the
lung, the diaphragm and pericardium

431
00:25:34,266 --> 00:25:38,051
with this tumor. Yeah.
That's what I need to do.

432
00:25:38,154 --> 00:25:42,055
That's what's advisable
for optimal survival.

433
00:25:45,227 --> 00:25:46,660
But that's not what
we're gonna do.

434
00:25:46,762 --> 00:25:48,595
We're going to
remove the visible tumor

435
00:25:48,697 --> 00:25:50,830
and we are going
to treat the lung

436
00:25:50,932 --> 00:25:53,717
with intrapleural
hyperthermic chemotherapy.

437
00:25:53,819 --> 00:25:56,687
Karev, find out what Bailey
used in the procedure this morning

438
00:25:56,788 --> 00:26:00,024
and gather everything I need.
Yang, help me remove this tumor.

439
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:03,109
This morning, Bailey said hot
chemo lavage was only indicated

440
00:26:03,211 --> 00:26:05,729
- in abdominal surgery.
- Sugarman at the Brigham

441
00:26:05,831 --> 00:26:09,850
has been researching its applications
as it applies to pleural mesothelioma.

442
00:26:09,952 --> 00:26:14,020
And he's a singer.
And he needs his lung.

443
00:26:23,465 --> 00:26:25,732
You look like hell.

444
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:28,752
Chicken pox. Stay
back, I'm contagious.

445
00:26:28,854 --> 00:26:30,904
I had them when I was six.

446
00:26:33,342 --> 00:26:34,875
What...?

447
00:26:34,977 --> 00:26:37,444
Aah...

448
00:26:37,546 --> 00:26:42,415
Ow... How was LA?

449
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:45,618
Addison nicked one
of the uterine arteries,

450
00:26:45,721 --> 00:26:47,137
but she was able to fix it.

451
00:26:48,257 --> 00:26:52,092
Sloan's OK and the
baby's gonna be OK, too.

452
00:26:52,194 --> 00:26:53,711
Good.

453
00:26:55,731 --> 00:26:58,582
I slept with Addison.

454
00:26:58,684 --> 00:27:01,451
- I gotta tell Lexie, right?
- No.

455
00:27:01,553 --> 00:27:03,364
It's Lexie. She's so good.

456
00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:05,856
- How do you lie
to a girl like that?
- Lie.

457
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:07,068
- Really?
- Really.

458
00:27:07,092 --> 00:27:08,959
- Really?
- Yeah.

459
00:27:10,662 --> 00:27:12,546
I hurt.

460
00:27:15,851 --> 00:27:21,155
- I got you covered, kid.
- What are you doing?

461
00:27:21,257 --> 00:27:23,323
I'm gonna help you.

462
00:27:26,162 --> 00:27:29,195
Oh, my... Oh, my.

463
00:27:30,182 --> 00:27:32,433
- That's amazing!
- No scar.

464
00:27:32,535 --> 00:27:33,645
No, keep going.

465
00:27:33,669 --> 00:27:37,721
Thank you. Thank you,
thank you, thank you.

466
00:27:37,823 --> 00:27:40,440
You saved the lung?
The whole lung?

467
00:27:40,542 --> 00:27:45,379
- Yes.
- OK. Well, now what?

468
00:27:45,481 --> 00:27:47,408
Now, the work really begins.

469
00:27:47,432 --> 00:27:52,169
This is gonna be a long
recovery. But he should be fine.

470
00:27:52,271 --> 00:27:56,773
Does it make me awful to say
that I'm slightly disappointed?

471
00:27:56,875 --> 00:27:58,742
I guess I was sitting
out here thinking,

472
00:27:58,844 --> 00:28:00,411
now he's gonna be
like the rest of us,

473
00:28:00,513 --> 00:28:03,296
who teach and direct

474
00:28:03,398 --> 00:28:06,933
and do all the things
he finds so demeaning.

475
00:28:08,053 --> 00:28:09,953
You know what's demeaning?

476
00:28:10,056 --> 00:28:12,239
Loving a man,
taking care of him,

477
00:28:12,341 --> 00:28:14,925
doing his shopping,
making his meals,

478
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:17,027
making sure his
humidifiers are clean,

479
00:28:17,129 --> 00:28:20,063
'cause God forbid his
humidifiers aren't clean.

480
00:28:21,433 --> 00:28:25,235
What's demeaning
is loving a man...

481
00:28:26,104 --> 00:28:28,772
who thinks so little of you.

482
00:28:32,945 --> 00:28:36,265
He's got an army of nurses, so if
you wanna walk out of here, you can.

483
00:28:36,298 --> 00:28:38,782
We'll take care of
him. You can go.

484
00:28:43,539 --> 00:28:44,904
I love him.

485
00:28:48,944 --> 00:28:52,762
- You should hear him sing.
- Nobody sings that well.

486
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:55,148
He does.

487
00:29:01,290 --> 00:29:04,174
See that stitch there? You just
made the dude diabetic for life.

488
00:29:04,276 --> 00:29:07,978
OK. Shut up. I'm trying to
concentrate until the chief gets here.

489
00:29:10,766 --> 00:29:12,298
Dr. Webber apologizes.

490
00:29:12,418 --> 00:29:16,637
He got caught up in some
sort of administrative something.

491
00:29:16,739 --> 00:29:18,249
So let's dig in. Patient ready?

492
00:29:18,273 --> 00:29:19,901
Yeah. We are all
prepped and ready.

493
00:29:19,925 --> 00:29:21,975
- Just waiting on you.
- Dr. Grey, care to open?

494
00:29:22,077 --> 00:29:24,344
Actually, I was gonna
open, Dr. Bailey.

495
00:29:24,446 --> 00:29:26,880
OK. Sure.

496
00:29:26,982 --> 00:29:29,867
Dr. Webber was going to let me
do the pancreatic neck dissection.

497
00:29:29,969 --> 00:29:33,703
- So I've prepped...
- I don't believe
you're ready for that.

498
00:29:33,806 --> 00:29:37,340
I'll be doing it. You're
welcome to observe.

499
00:29:39,011 --> 00:29:41,945
- Go ahead.
- Ten blade.

500
00:29:46,168 --> 00:29:48,569
Sorry you didn't get a
chance to do the procedure.

501
00:29:48,671 --> 00:29:49,748
Something came up, it happens.

502
00:29:49,772 --> 00:29:51,349
Not surprised about
Richard, though.

503
00:29:51,373 --> 00:29:53,940
You're not a dumb person,
but you're acting like one.

504
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:56,142
I am not going to turn him in.

505
00:29:57,513 --> 00:29:59,662
Tacoma passed on Izzie.

506
00:29:59,764 --> 00:30:03,400
I did my best. Just too much
history. Too many red flags.

507
00:30:04,836 --> 00:30:07,048
If I went to the board,
they'd make me chief.

508
00:30:07,072 --> 00:30:09,432
First thing I'd do is
hire Stevens back.

509
00:30:12,344 --> 00:30:14,744
It's your choice.
It's up to you.

510
00:30:28,961 --> 00:30:30,593
That should be me.

511
00:30:30,696 --> 00:30:34,748
Don't be jealous. They're
just friends. Best friends.

512
00:30:37,853 --> 00:30:42,021
I had the chicken pox. I
told her I hadn't because...

513
00:30:44,125 --> 00:30:45,859
I find her miraculous.

514
00:30:46,695 --> 00:30:48,862
Breathtakingly stunning.

515
00:30:49,431 --> 00:30:51,965
Just...

516
00:30:52,067 --> 00:30:53,716
I can't stop looking at her.

517
00:30:53,818 --> 00:30:59,355
And I was afraid with the ooze
and the fevers and the scratching...

518
00:30:59,457 --> 00:31:01,625
I wanted to stay in
the sexy part of things,

519
00:31:01,727 --> 00:31:04,327
so I lied to my girlfriend.

520
00:31:04,429 --> 00:31:05,628
And now...

521
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:11,584
- he makes scratching
look sexy.
- Mmm.

522
00:31:12,721 --> 00:31:15,421
He makes everything look sexy.

523
00:31:23,565 --> 00:31:24,831
So you get it.

524
00:31:24,933 --> 00:31:27,400
You didn't have to
do that, but you did.

525
00:31:27,503 --> 00:31:29,485
- You get it.
- What are you talking about?

526
00:31:29,587 --> 00:31:32,089
I'd choose surgery over a guy.

527
00:31:32,191 --> 00:31:34,691
I'm not gonna apologize
for it. Especially to you.

528
00:31:34,793 --> 00:31:36,109
You didn't have
to save his lung.

529
00:31:36,211 --> 00:31:37,839
The right thing would've
been to remove it.

530
00:31:37,863 --> 00:31:41,498
But the patient was clear that he
didn't want to live without his gift.

531
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,867
And you get that.

532
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:46,853
I choose my gift.

533
00:31:46,955 --> 00:31:50,157
I want to be great. And
I want to learn from you.

534
00:31:51,193 --> 00:31:52,925
I choose my gift.

535
00:31:59,484 --> 00:32:01,351
Hey, how'd your surgery go?

536
00:32:01,453 --> 00:32:03,453
- Great.
- See? And you were all worried.

537
00:32:03,538 --> 00:32:06,005
You're a rock star. Speaking
of which, do you know

538
00:32:06,107 --> 00:32:10,610
- if Derek has talked
to Tacoma yet?
- No, I don't.

539
00:32:10,713 --> 00:32:13,830
OK. Good. I just got my scans
back and they're really good.

540
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:17,667
So it'd be great if he could mention
that I'm officially not dying of cancer

541
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:21,271
when he talks to them.
I'm gonna get this job, Mer.

542
00:32:21,373 --> 00:32:24,291
I'm gonna get this job and get
Alex back and be myself again.

543
00:32:24,393 --> 00:32:27,410
I can feel it. OK, I'm
gonna go get Derek

544
00:32:27,512 --> 00:32:29,373
and show my scans
before he calls Tacoma.

545
00:32:29,397 --> 00:32:34,584
OK. You know, I'll go tell him.
Derek. And you go tell Alex.

546
00:32:34,686 --> 00:32:36,386
OK.

547
00:32:45,179 --> 00:32:47,747
OK, fine. You can
go to the board.

548
00:32:48,583 --> 00:32:50,583
Just...

549
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:04,063
Sorry. Car crash came in. I
got here as soon as I could.

550
00:33:04,165 --> 00:33:07,350
That's OK. It gave
me time to get drunk.

551
00:33:07,452 --> 00:33:10,486
- So, what's the occasion?
- I thought Beth was an idiot.

552
00:33:10,588 --> 00:33:13,323
- If we're being honest here.
- I didn't know that we are.

553
00:33:13,425 --> 00:33:16,926
Maybe not an idiot, but
just not good enough for you.

554
00:33:17,028 --> 00:33:20,346
- So how long you been here?
- You know, I'm sure

555
00:33:20,449 --> 00:33:22,249
- that it wasn't easy for her.
- Teddy.

556
00:33:22,351 --> 00:33:24,078
But do you know what
she said to me once?

557
00:33:24,102 --> 00:33:27,404
She said that once you guys
were married, she was done.

558
00:33:27,506 --> 00:33:29,172
She was done teaching,

559
00:33:29,274 --> 00:33:31,774
and she was just gonna
start making babies.

560
00:33:31,876 --> 00:33:35,128
And I remember thinking to
myself, "Wow, does Owen know

561
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:37,208
you have, like, zero ambition?"

562
00:33:37,232 --> 00:33:41,601
Then there's Cristina, there's
Cristina, who is exactly the opposite.

563
00:33:41,703 --> 00:33:46,489
I mean, it'd actually be
funny if it wasn't so... just...

564
00:33:46,591 --> 00:33:50,526
not funny. I mean, I get it.

565
00:33:50,628 --> 00:33:55,464
She... she is beautiful and
talented and kind of amazing.

566
00:33:55,567 --> 00:33:57,717
- She's right. I get her.
- I'm calling you a cab.

567
00:33:57,820 --> 00:34:01,420
I get her, but she was
willing to trade you.

568
00:34:02,858 --> 00:34:04,674
For me.

569
00:34:04,776 --> 00:34:08,928
If I stayed, she said
I could have you.

570
00:34:22,243 --> 00:34:24,711
- How was your surgery?
- It was good.

571
00:34:24,813 --> 00:34:27,530
It was... it was fine. It was...

572
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:30,500
You want to see?

573
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:41,411
I'm so... I'm so glad!

574
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:43,997
I'm so glad.

575
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:48,468
- It's like it never happened.
- Yeah. But it did.

576
00:34:48,570 --> 00:34:50,403
It all happened, Iz.

577
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:53,056
You got cancer
and we got married.

578
00:34:53,158 --> 00:34:56,693
And you died and you
lived again. And you...

579
00:34:56,795 --> 00:35:00,597
You left and you came
back. And we got through it.

580
00:35:01,733 --> 00:35:05,969
I got through it. And
I'm on the other side.

581
00:35:06,071 --> 00:35:09,356
Iz, I love you so much.

582
00:35:09,458 --> 00:35:11,090
And I...

583
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:12,659
Until I met you,

584
00:35:12,761 --> 00:35:16,279
I used to think I just
wasn't a good guy.

585
00:35:17,432 --> 00:35:20,967
Growing up in my family,
that's what they told me.

586
00:35:21,653 --> 00:35:23,320
But now,

587
00:35:23,405 --> 00:35:26,606
after all of it, I know
that I'm a good man.

588
00:35:26,708 --> 00:35:29,575
And I thank you for that.

589
00:35:29,677 --> 00:35:33,929
Because I know now that I'm
good enough not to deserve this.

590
00:35:36,618 --> 00:35:40,353
Not to have to feel like this.

591
00:35:40,455 --> 00:35:44,174
Not to love you so much
that I almost hate you.

592
00:35:46,194 --> 00:35:49,562
I deserve someone who will stay.

593
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:53,833
I'm happy you're OK.

594
00:35:54,770 --> 00:35:57,250
And I'm happy about your job.

595
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:00,740
And I want you to go.

596
00:36:03,061 --> 00:36:06,596
And be happy. And not come back.

597
00:36:33,692 --> 00:36:35,692
Meredith?

598
00:36:47,255 --> 00:36:50,873
I'm sorry about the surgery.

599
00:36:50,975 --> 00:36:52,475
I got caught up with paperwork.

600
00:36:52,577 --> 00:36:55,928
You don't have to apologize.

601
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:59,882
You don't have to
apologize for anything.

602
00:37:03,171 --> 00:37:05,605
<i>In surgery...</i>

603
00:37:05,707 --> 00:37:08,641
<i>the healing process
begins with a cut...</i>

604
00:37:11,379 --> 00:37:13,195
<i>an incision...</i>

605
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:18,284
<i>the tearing of flesh.</i>

606
00:37:20,522 --> 00:37:23,856
Where have you been?
You just disappeared.

607
00:37:25,027 --> 00:37:28,027
I left you, like, ten messages.

608
00:37:28,129 --> 00:37:29,796
Are you drunk?

609
00:37:33,619 --> 00:37:37,754
- Wait. What? What? What?
- You make me sad.

610
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:41,958
You think that a surgery
is gonna make you feel.

611
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:45,411
You think a successful career
is gonna make you happy.

612
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:46,646
You think you know things.

613
00:37:46,748 --> 00:37:48,765
You know things and
nothing else matters.

614
00:37:48,867 --> 00:37:51,584
No one else matters.
People do matter. I matter.

615
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:53,319
We...

616
00:37:54,956 --> 00:37:56,656
We matter.

617
00:38:03,548 --> 00:38:06,049
So you don't get
to toss me aside.

618
00:38:07,185 --> 00:38:09,319
I won't let you.

619
00:38:09,421 --> 00:38:12,656
<i>We have to damage
the healthy flesh...</i>

620
00:38:18,262 --> 00:38:20,713
<i>in order to expose
the unhealthy.</i>

621
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:32,125
<i>It feels cruel.</i>

622
00:38:33,128 --> 00:38:34,794
Hey.

623
00:38:35,663 --> 00:38:36,941
Hey.

624
00:38:36,965 --> 00:38:38,131
Uh...

625
00:38:38,233 --> 00:38:41,417
- How did Sloan's surgery go?
- I slept with Addison.

626
00:38:44,122 --> 00:38:47,791
Thank God. 'Cause
I slept with Alex.

627
00:38:47,892 --> 00:38:49,225
I was feeling so...

628
00:38:49,328 --> 00:38:51,343
Well, you know
how I was feeling.

629
00:38:51,445 --> 00:38:54,213
Which is why this
is great. We're even.

630
00:38:54,315 --> 00:38:57,549
We've kind of
canceled each other out.

631
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:03,690
- You slept with Karev?
- Yeah.

632
00:39:03,792 --> 00:39:06,625
While I was dealing
with my sick daughter?

633
00:39:06,727 --> 00:39:08,895
While I was hurting?

634
00:39:08,997 --> 00:39:13,483
Well, you weren't hurting.
You were sleeping with Addison.

635
00:39:13,585 --> 00:39:17,554
You broke up with me. Left me.

636
00:39:18,623 --> 00:39:22,708
And you just... Wow.

637
00:39:23,878 --> 00:39:25,611
I...

638
00:39:27,415 --> 00:39:30,066
I can't even look
at you right now.

639
00:39:31,819 --> 00:39:34,287
<i>And against common sense.</i>

640
00:39:37,225 --> 00:39:39,826
Do you know what it took
for me to make this happen?

641
00:39:39,928 --> 00:39:42,039
Please tell Derek
I'm really sorry.

642
00:39:42,063 --> 00:39:45,448
This isn't about Derek.
It's about me. It's about us.

643
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:47,483
You don't just walk
away from people.

644
00:39:47,586 --> 00:39:49,485
You don't just
throw people away.

645
00:39:49,588 --> 00:39:52,755
I can't, Meredith, OK?
I can't be here! Please!

646
00:39:52,857 --> 00:39:56,376
Please try to understand.
I have to start over.

647
00:39:56,478 --> 00:39:58,777
I need to start over. OK?

648
00:40:14,695 --> 00:40:16,345
Please don't go.

649
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:23,403
- This is your home.
- No, it's not.

650
00:40:23,505 --> 00:40:27,123
Not anymore. It's just a place I
worked. I can do that anywhere.

651
00:40:36,101 --> 00:40:38,650
<i>But it works.</i>

652
00:40:40,138 --> 00:40:42,872
<i>You risk exposure...</i>

653
00:40:42,974 --> 00:40:46,792
What are you doing?
You'll get the chicken pox.

654
00:40:46,894 --> 00:40:50,263
So I get the chicken pox.

655
00:40:50,365 --> 00:40:52,565
<i>For the sake of healing.</i>

656
00:40:57,171 --> 00:40:59,205
<i>And when it's over...</i>

657
00:41:01,543 --> 00:41:04,310
<i>once the incision
has been closed...</i>

658
00:41:06,615 --> 00:41:07,780
<i>you wait.</i>

659
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:10,194
Did you see him before he left?

660
00:41:10,218 --> 00:41:14,019
No. I didn't think it
would make it easier.

661
00:41:15,957 --> 00:41:18,491
For him or for you?

662
00:41:18,593 --> 00:41:20,693
This is the best thing for him.

663
00:41:22,029 --> 00:41:23,529
You know that.

664
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:26,999
It's the only thing.

665
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:32,304
Let's not pretend
you did this for him.

666
00:41:32,406 --> 00:41:37,076
It's just you and me here,
Derek. You did this for you.

667
00:41:37,178 --> 00:41:42,481
In the choice between surgery
and love, you chose surgery.

668
00:41:43,451 --> 00:41:46,218
- You chose ambition today.
- So did you.

669
00:41:47,321 --> 00:41:49,655
You knew he wasn't ready
to go back into the OR,

670
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:52,324
but you wanted to do
that surgery so badly,

671
00:41:52,426 --> 00:41:54,426
you were willing to overlook it.

672
00:41:57,364 --> 00:42:02,234
- We're the same.
<i>- You wait,</i>

673
00:42:02,336 --> 00:42:05,771
