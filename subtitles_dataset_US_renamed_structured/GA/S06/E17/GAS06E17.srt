1
00:00:04,505 --> 00:00:07,072
<i>Surgeons aren't
complacent people.</i>

2
00:00:07,174 --> 00:00:09,724
- Fifty!
- - <i>We don't put our feet up.</i>

3
00:00:09,827 --> 00:00:11,821
<i>We don't sit still.</i>

4
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:13,762
<i>Whatever the game is...</i>

5
00:00:14,564 --> 00:00:16,665
<i>we like to win.</i>

6
00:00:16,783 --> 00:00:20,268
<i>And once we win,
we get a new game.</i>

7
00:00:21,322 --> 00:00:24,139
Today... feels
like the day to me.

8
00:00:24,241 --> 00:00:28,777
I think, by the close of business
today, I've got cartilage in a bottle.

9
00:00:29,746 --> 00:00:31,980
- What's with you?
- You,

10
00:00:32,082 --> 00:00:35,067
Derek, you're all, "Don't screw
the nurses and the drug reps."

11
00:00:35,169 --> 00:00:37,736
You did a psych rotation,
you know what happens when

12
00:00:37,838 --> 00:00:40,172
you tell someone not to
think about an elephant.

13
00:00:40,274 --> 00:00:41,954
You spend a lot
of time thinking...

14
00:00:42,043 --> 00:00:45,761
I walk around the hospital trying
not to make eye contact with women.

15
00:00:47,497 --> 00:00:51,866
I'm... lonely. And unhappy.

16
00:00:51,985 --> 00:00:53,902
I don't see how
this is a solution.

17
00:00:54,004 --> 00:00:57,155
Find a grown-up who wants
what you want and date.

18
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:00,876
- Like a grown-up.
- I don't know what that means.

19
00:01:05,281 --> 00:01:08,933
Oncology's kept you busy. Two
rounds of chemo, brachytherapy,

20
00:01:09,035 --> 00:01:10,802
two rounds of
external radiation.

21
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:14,072
Not to mention coenzymes,
shark cartilage, milk thistle.

22
00:01:14,174 --> 00:01:17,659
- I'm open to pretty
much anything.
- Except surgery.

23
00:01:17,761 --> 00:01:19,961
That's because
surgery's not gonna work.

24
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:21,997
We'd like to hear
all the options.

25
00:01:22,099 --> 00:01:24,616
Well, your scans will
be back any moment.

26
00:01:24,718 --> 00:01:26,512
Let me tell you what you'll see.

27
00:01:26,536 --> 00:01:28,703
My tumor's the
size of a football.

28
00:01:28,805 --> 00:01:29,821
Audrey.

29
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:31,551
It's wrapped around my organs.

30
00:01:31,575 --> 00:01:34,375
And if you try to
cut it out, it'll kill me.

31
00:01:35,763 --> 00:01:37,045
That's what you'll see.

32
00:01:37,147 --> 00:01:41,216
<i>We push ourselves.
Residents, attendings.</i>

33
00:01:41,318 --> 00:01:43,302
<i>It doesn't matter
how much we achieve.</i>

34
00:01:43,404 --> 00:01:46,922
<i>If you're a climber, there's
always another mountain.</i>

35
00:01:47,024 --> 00:01:49,608
Dr. Hunt! These are your scans.

36
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:52,004
I was just looking around.

37
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:54,229
- That's quite a tumor.
- Huge.

38
00:01:54,331 --> 00:01:56,098
Probably nothing to be done.

39
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,267
Mind if I take a stab at it?

40
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:02,905
Well, it sounds strange
to you, I'm sure, but...

41
00:02:03,007 --> 00:02:04,834
I only have a few
years left in the game,

42
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:07,576
and there may not be so
many big tumors left for me.

43
00:02:07,678 --> 00:02:10,612
Of course. You're welcome to it.

44
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:11,958
What are you doing?

45
00:02:11,982 --> 00:02:14,342
Thanks, Hunt. You're a good egg.

46
00:02:14,435 --> 00:02:15,684
What are you doing?

47
00:02:15,786 --> 00:02:18,086
I'm sure you've got
work to do, Dr. Yang.

48
00:02:18,188 --> 00:02:19,321
Mmm-hmm!

49
00:02:24,828 --> 00:02:26,711
- Chart?
- Oh!

50
00:02:27,197 --> 00:02:29,130
Oh!

51
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:33,246
- What are you doing?
- What?

52
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:35,671
This is a monster case,
and he just stole it from you

53
00:02:35,773 --> 00:02:38,173
with some crap about
mortality and old men.

54
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:40,086
He's playing you.
What are you doing?!

55
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:41,243
All right.

56
00:02:43,213 --> 00:02:44,846
Dr. Webber?

57
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:49,985
Dr. Webber, I'd like to keep
Audrey Taylor. She was my case.

58
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:51,681
- You gave it to me.
- You swiped it.

59
00:02:51,705 --> 00:02:54,406
- Cristina.
- Got Harper Avery
written all over it.

60
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:57,309
When Dr. Avery was here,
he did mention that I needed

61
00:02:57,411 --> 00:03:00,412
to dive back into my research.
This case would be perfect...

62
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:02,830
This thing is a monster.
At best, it's damage control.

63
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:04,572
I'll be operating by
the seat of my pants.

64
00:03:04,668 --> 00:03:08,787
On the contrary, a tumor like
this calls for a methodical analysis

65
00:03:08,889 --> 00:03:11,456
- of the scans, a careful plan.
- Right. Old school.

66
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:13,207
Old?

67
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:16,761
Wow. I didn't see that coming.

68
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:17,912
I did not mean your age.

69
00:03:18,014 --> 00:03:19,964
I meant approach. Let's
not make this personal.

70
00:03:20,067 --> 00:03:23,051
You just did, Ginger.
And you're right.

71
00:03:23,153 --> 00:03:25,904
I've been resecting tumors
since you were in diapers.

72
00:03:26,006 --> 00:03:29,524
In my experience, they demand
something a little more elegant

73
00:03:29,627 --> 00:03:32,127
- than "by seat of your pants."
- This is my patient.

74
00:03:32,229 --> 00:03:35,063
Good morning.
Why are we arguing?

75
00:03:35,165 --> 00:03:36,898
- Wow. Big.
- Whose patient is this?

76
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,017
- Mine.
- Work on it together.

77
00:03:39,119 --> 00:03:41,152
Harper Avery is
an individual award.

78
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:44,422
- Ah! I see where this is going.
- A case like this

79
00:03:44,524 --> 00:03:45,568
needs an aggressive approach...

80
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:48,209
Sloppy. It requires
methodical analysis...

81
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:49,591
Some would say outmoded.

82
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,763
- Outmoded?
- All right.

83
00:03:51,865 --> 00:03:54,533
Nothing wrong with friendly
professional competition.

84
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:55,995
Come up with
plans, I will choose.

85
00:03:56,019 --> 00:03:57,485
Dr. Yang, Dr. Grey will assist.

86
00:03:57,587 --> 00:04:00,072
- Yes!
- I'm with Webber!

87
00:04:00,174 --> 00:04:02,089
What? He's got it in the bag.

88
00:04:08,932 --> 00:04:11,933
"I'm with Webber?" Why'd you
push me to do it in the first place?

89
00:04:12,035 --> 00:04:17,038
Now you'll know what your
plan is and what his plan is.

90
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:19,641
Wait. You're gonna spy on him?

91
00:04:19,743 --> 00:04:20,792
That's... That's cheating.

92
00:04:20,894 --> 00:04:22,839
You're adorable
when you're slow.

93
00:04:22,863 --> 00:04:26,113
You have a dark, dark mind.

94
00:04:29,452 --> 00:04:31,653
- Here.
- Thanks.

95
00:04:31,755 --> 00:04:34,656
- Hey. You working tonight?
- Uh... No.

96
00:04:34,758 --> 00:04:36,224
I'm going to a yoga class.

97
00:04:36,326 --> 00:04:38,844
Nothing about that
statement makes sense.

98
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:42,013
Tuck's with his father, and
the fascist vegan next door

99
00:04:42,116 --> 00:04:43,815
gave me a yoga
class for Christmas.

100
00:04:43,917 --> 00:04:46,585
No, you're having
dinner with me.

101
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:50,355
The fascist vegan thinks that yoga's
going to make me a better person,

102
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:52,841
which is unlikely,
but if I don't go,

103
00:04:52,943 --> 00:04:54,475
I'll have to hear
about it every day.

104
00:04:54,578 --> 00:04:57,412
"My back kinda hurts,
but the breathing...

105
00:04:57,514 --> 00:05:00,081
I've never breathed like
that before in my life!"

106
00:05:00,183 --> 00:05:02,528
That's what people say
after their first yoga class.

107
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:04,547
Tell her that, have
dinner with me.

108
00:05:04,571 --> 00:05:05,854
Come on.

109
00:05:05,956 --> 00:05:08,757
Try it. "My back kinda
hurts, but the breathing...

110
00:05:08,859 --> 00:05:11,726
- I've..."
- "Never breathed
like that in my life."

111
00:05:11,828 --> 00:05:14,846
- More conviction.
- "I've never breathed like that

112
00:05:14,948 --> 00:05:17,281
- in my life."
- There you go.

113
00:05:28,945 --> 00:05:31,012
- What?
- This, um...

114
00:05:31,114 --> 00:05:33,514
This patient, I can't
find the heartbeat.

115
00:05:33,616 --> 00:05:36,034
- So call the morgue, 40-watt.
- He's not dead.

116
00:05:36,136 --> 00:05:37,451
He's sitting up, he's talking.

117
00:05:37,553 --> 00:05:39,954
You're lucky you
have a famous name.

118
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:42,240
Take a deep breath, sir.

119
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:45,143
Having... trouble doing that.

120
00:05:45,245 --> 00:05:46,594
Oh, grow up, Todd.

121
00:05:46,696 --> 00:05:48,496
When he was nine, they
removed his right lung.

122
00:05:48,531 --> 00:05:50,548
Now the other one's
crapping out on me.

123
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:54,119
Maybe you're having an anxiety attack
because I asked you to move in with me.

124
00:05:54,204 --> 00:05:57,055
- I can't find his heart.
- Oh, yeah? Me neither.

125
00:05:57,157 --> 00:05:59,218
- No, I really can't.
- Who's the 40-watt now?

126
00:05:59,242 --> 00:06:02,693
I can't... I can't...

127
00:06:02,795 --> 00:06:05,246
Get a stat chest
x-ray and page cardio!

128
00:06:08,602 --> 00:06:12,937
- There she is. By your kidney.
- My heart is by my kidney?

129
00:06:13,023 --> 00:06:15,001
That's why it was hard
to hear your heartbeat.

130
00:06:15,025 --> 00:06:18,693
And without a second lung in your
chest cavity, your heart sort of drifted.

131
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,945
It's called
postpneumonectomy syndrome.

132
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:23,325
The shifting caused
bronchial compression.

133
00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:24,794
That's why you
weren't able to breathe.

134
00:06:24,818 --> 00:06:26,512
I'm the biggest
bitch in the world.

135
00:06:26,536 --> 00:06:28,270
Can you put it
back where it goes?

136
00:06:28,372 --> 00:06:31,668
Yes. We're gonna use saline
implants in your chest to keep it in place.

137
00:06:31,692 --> 00:06:34,141
Implants? Like
what they use for...

138
00:06:34,243 --> 00:06:35,810
Fake boobs.

139
00:06:35,912 --> 00:06:37,723
You wanna put...?
I can't have...

140
00:06:37,747 --> 00:06:41,132
No. I'm a guy.
OK? I'm a guy's guy.

141
00:06:41,218 --> 00:06:44,085
- You won't actually see them.
- Yeah, but still.

142
00:06:44,188 --> 00:06:47,555
Come on, you know what I'm
saying. I mean, how am I supposed to,

143
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:50,024
- you know...
- What, pick up women?

144
00:06:50,126 --> 00:06:54,095
How do you explain your boobs to the
next chick dumb enough to date you?

145
00:06:54,197 --> 00:06:55,463
Molly.

146
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:57,365
Molly.

147
00:07:00,387 --> 00:07:03,387
- Do I have a choice?
- Do you like to breathe?

148
00:07:05,108 --> 00:07:08,126
So, yes, there is
a surgical option...

149
00:07:08,228 --> 00:07:11,779
We're still figuring
out the best approach.

150
00:07:11,881 --> 00:07:15,450
The risks with this
surgery are very high.

151
00:07:15,552 --> 00:07:18,169
The tumor has compromised
the organs to the point

152
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,539
where anything
we do to remove it...

153
00:07:20,641 --> 00:07:21,973
Will kill me.

154
00:07:22,075 --> 00:07:24,292
Audrey, you're not
even listening to them.

155
00:07:24,394 --> 00:07:27,345
It doesn't make sense. I
just want one more month.

156
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,748
I'm not gonna risk
dying before that.

157
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:33,819
One more month?

158
00:07:33,921 --> 00:07:37,989
Our daughter is getting
married, in a month.

159
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:39,969
And I would like
to see her do that.

160
00:07:39,993 --> 00:07:43,394
I would... I would
like to see her

161
00:07:43,497 --> 00:07:44,924
on the happiest day of her life.

162
00:07:44,948 --> 00:07:47,648
Mrs. Taylor, if we
don't try surgery,

163
00:07:47,751 --> 00:07:49,984
you might not make
it through the month.

164
00:07:58,278 --> 00:07:59,427
Then...

165
00:08:01,565 --> 00:08:04,032
I look forward to hearing...

166
00:08:05,134 --> 00:08:07,369
what you come up with.

167
00:08:15,379 --> 00:08:16,895
- Hi, I'm Dr. Grey.
- Hi.

168
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:19,297
He's really hot and his
stomach hurts so much.

169
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:22,050
He was fine. We were
playing at the zoo one minute,

170
00:08:22,152 --> 00:08:24,619
- and he was fine. Please.
- OK.

171
00:08:24,721 --> 00:08:26,821
- Noah, does it hurt over here?
- Ow!

172
00:08:26,924 --> 00:08:29,341
- It's OK, baby.
- Page Dr. Robbins, stat.

173
00:08:29,443 --> 00:08:30,825
Right away, doctor.

174
00:08:32,346 --> 00:08:34,545
Hey. Do you have a
minute? I got a question.

175
00:08:34,631 --> 00:08:36,542
- Sure.
- I want to talk
about breast implants.

176
00:08:36,566 --> 00:08:38,766
Really? Good for you.

177
00:08:38,868 --> 00:08:41,603
You know, it crossed my
mind the first time I saw you,

178
00:08:41,704 --> 00:08:44,422
but I didn't think you
were the type to go for it.

179
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,524
No! Not for me.

180
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:49,227
- For my patient.
- Oh...

181
00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:51,079
Oh!

182
00:08:51,181 --> 00:08:52,697
- Of course.
- Hey!

183
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:55,266
Can I steal him
for a quick consult?

184
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:57,001
Yeah. He's all yours.

185
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:00,900
Yeah, I was just...

186
00:09:00,924 --> 00:09:03,324
She's what you're looking for.

187
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:05,844
She's age appropriate,
probably wants kids.

188
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:08,057
- Ask her out.
- I'm not sure
that's gonna work.

189
00:09:08,081 --> 00:09:11,232
Great, thanks. As you were.

190
00:09:13,103 --> 00:09:16,788
Teddy, sorry about that.
Your breasts are fantastic.

191
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,389
I wouldn't change a thing.

192
00:09:22,378 --> 00:09:25,546
- The patient.
- Um... He... Uh...

193
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:27,782
He's got postpneumonectomy
syndrome.

194
00:09:27,884 --> 00:09:31,202
I wanted to use the
implants to stabilize his heart.

195
00:09:31,305 --> 00:09:33,554
Of course. Let me take a look.

196
00:09:35,892 --> 00:09:40,127
So asking you out tonight
is probably a bad idea?

197
00:09:40,697 --> 00:09:42,313
You think?

198
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:55,626
- What?
- Mark Sloan just asked me out.

199
00:09:56,195 --> 00:09:58,162
Huh?

200
00:09:58,265 --> 00:10:01,032
- Cool.
- No. No, not cool.

201
00:10:01,134 --> 00:10:02,767
Mark Sloan.

202
00:10:02,869 --> 00:10:06,221
Exactly. Why not have
a little fun? Mark is like...

203
00:10:06,323 --> 00:10:09,290
candy. Eat it and
forget about it.

204
00:10:09,393 --> 00:10:12,727
Right? Come on. Know what?
This might be the best idea I've had.

205
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,745
Will you have to resect
part of the diaphragm?

206
00:10:19,769 --> 00:10:21,536
Most likely.

207
00:10:21,638 --> 00:10:25,223
Or I might let you
do the resection.

208
00:10:25,325 --> 00:10:26,825
- Really?
- Yup.

209
00:10:26,927 --> 00:10:29,226
That, or kick you off the case.

210
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:33,331
Depends on how much
you leak to Dr. Hunt.

211
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:37,802
I've been doing this a long time, Dr
Yang. You're working for the other side.

212
00:10:38,654 --> 00:10:41,773
Now, there is another option,

213
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:45,626
if you would like to
realign your allegiances.

214
00:10:46,863 --> 00:10:49,097
Like be a double agent?

215
00:10:49,199 --> 00:10:54,235
We can keep looking for more
resections for you to perform.

216
00:10:54,337 --> 00:10:57,038
So think about it.

217
00:10:57,607 --> 00:10:58,790
Take your time.

218
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,561
It's a big tumor.

219
00:11:08,969 --> 00:11:11,202
- You rang?
- Yeah.

220
00:11:11,304 --> 00:11:13,549
I'm this close to making
headway on my cartilage,

221
00:11:13,573 --> 00:11:15,701
but I keep getting 42
intern questions an hour.

222
00:11:15,725 --> 00:11:17,469
Can they rotate through
your service for today?

223
00:11:17,493 --> 00:11:20,261
- Sure!
- Thanks.

224
00:11:21,831 --> 00:11:24,765
- What is with you?
- Nothing.

225
00:11:24,867 --> 00:11:29,737
Is it the guy? It's the guy!

226
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,756
- He bought you coffee?
- No.

227
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:33,791
Think I smile like
this for coffee?

228
00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:35,526
He's making me dinner.

229
00:11:36,379 --> 00:11:40,615
He's cooking? Wow. You ready?

230
00:11:40,717 --> 00:11:43,601
What, for food? I
think I can handle it.

231
00:11:43,686 --> 00:11:45,246
- No, for sex.
- What?

232
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:48,623
- No! Grow up.
- Give me a break.

233
00:11:48,725 --> 00:11:51,475
- How many dates have you had?
- This'll be three.

234
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:54,779
Oh, yeah. Third
date is the sex date.

235
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:57,615
And he's cooking
for you. At his home.

236
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,266
Where he keeps his bed.

237
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:02,670
I barely know the man.

238
00:12:02,772 --> 00:12:06,040
You're gonna know
him a lot better tomorrow.

239
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:09,093
There's nothing magic
about a third date.

240
00:12:09,195 --> 00:12:11,662
It is possible to
eat and go home

241
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:13,681
and not lose your
pants in the process.

242
00:12:13,783 --> 00:12:15,950
Oh, OK.

243
00:12:16,052 --> 00:12:18,686
But if it does go that way,
am I supposed to sleep over?

244
00:12:18,788 --> 00:12:21,556
Oh, no. No, sex on the couch.

245
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:25,126
Walk of shame to the car
under cover of darkness.

246
00:12:25,228 --> 00:12:27,412
- Do I wear a dress?
- Uh-uh. Casual.

247
00:12:27,514 --> 00:12:30,397
Like you don't expect it's gonna
happen, but you're ready for it.

248
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:32,266
How ready?

249
00:12:32,368 --> 00:12:37,188
Like... you've prepped
the surgical field.

250
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:39,573
The su...

251
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:43,611
- Oh! Torres!
- There is a Ukrainian woman

252
00:12:43,713 --> 00:12:47,415
who works at the manicure
place across the street.

253
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:51,569
- She will take care of you.
- You...!

254
00:12:51,671 --> 00:12:55,590
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh!

255
00:12:58,894 --> 00:13:02,746
You sure it's OK to give him this much
medicine when we don't know what's wrong?

256
00:13:02,849 --> 00:13:05,283
- It's not gonna hurt him.
- He needed a painkiller, Jim.

257
00:13:05,384 --> 00:13:07,184
I'm telling you, he needed it.

258
00:13:08,438 --> 00:13:10,003
Upright chest and
KUB are negative.

259
00:13:10,106 --> 00:13:13,558
Go get him set up
for a CT with contrast.

260
00:13:15,644 --> 00:13:17,996
How could this have happened?

261
00:13:18,081 --> 00:13:20,009
Say it. You think I
missed something.

262
00:13:20,033 --> 00:13:21,033
Honey, I don't.

263
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:23,400
Yes, you do. Just admit it.

264
00:13:23,503 --> 00:13:26,620
OK, fine. Fine! How do
you miss a fever this high?

265
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:28,467
Guys, this isn't gonna help.

266
00:13:28,491 --> 00:13:30,275
Kids get sick.
It's no one's fault.

267
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:31,696
Yes, it is. It's my fault.

268
00:13:31,761 --> 00:13:35,012
- Kelly, don't.
- If you'd been with him,

269
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:38,266
I'd blame you. I would kill you if
you had him and this happened.

270
00:13:38,368 --> 00:13:40,312
OK, I need to get him this CT.

271
00:13:40,336 --> 00:13:41,747
I've also added an IV
antibiotic because he's septic

272
00:13:41,771 --> 00:13:44,122
and I want to make sure
we've covered everything.

273
00:13:44,224 --> 00:13:47,859
Maybe he ate
something off the ground.

274
00:13:47,961 --> 00:13:50,461
I was watching him!

275
00:13:51,798 --> 00:13:55,099
- Audrey Taylor's latest LFTs.
- Thank you.

276
00:13:57,019 --> 00:14:00,822
Dr. Altman, I set aside
some saline implants

277
00:14:00,924 --> 00:14:04,258
for your postpneumonectomy
patient. Have a couple on hand.

278
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:07,928
Size-wise, you won't really know
what you need until you're in there.

279
00:14:08,965 --> 00:14:11,259
Can you scrub in,
place them for me?

280
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:12,433
Sure.

281
00:14:13,803 --> 00:14:16,270
You know, I was...

282
00:14:16,372 --> 00:14:18,484
Well, I may actually be
free tonight after work.

283
00:14:18,508 --> 00:14:20,291
- Really?
- Yeah.

284
00:14:20,393 --> 00:14:21,642
That's fantastic.

285
00:14:21,744 --> 00:14:24,695
There's a new Italian restaurant
I've been meaning to try.

286
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:28,182
- You and I can...
- Joe's is probably fine.

287
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:30,250
- For dinner?
- No!

288
00:14:30,353 --> 00:14:33,854
I mean... Well, you know...

289
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:38,125
- For a drink, and then...
- I was asking you to dinner.

290
00:14:38,227 --> 00:14:39,844
So that we could talk.

291
00:14:39,946 --> 00:14:43,798
Get to know each
other. That sort of thing.

292
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:47,201
Oh, that's... that's
not... I thought that...

293
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:49,103
You know,

294
00:14:49,205 --> 00:14:51,405
I'm not available for dinner.

295
00:14:51,507 --> 00:14:54,441
I'm... I'm sorry.

296
00:14:54,544 --> 00:14:56,811
Sloan? Sloan,
what are you doing?

297
00:14:56,913 --> 00:15:00,564
- Apparently, nothing.
- Teddy...

298
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:02,316
Teddy's not one of
these women that you...

299
00:15:02,418 --> 00:15:04,034
You can't just treat her like...

300
00:15:04,137 --> 00:15:06,415
This may come as a shock to you,

301
00:15:06,439 --> 00:15:10,641
but it looks like I'm the respectful
adult in this particular situation.

302
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:14,061
So how about you talk to her
about how she treats people?

303
00:15:26,108 --> 00:15:29,110
How genius is this?
Mark Sloan and Teddy.

304
00:15:29,212 --> 00:15:32,597
Are you serious?
I just said that.

305
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:35,299
Shut up! Are we so well matched
we have all the same thoughts?

306
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:37,869
Kinda creepy,
but it's kinda great.

307
00:15:37,971 --> 00:15:40,304
I'm just saying.

308
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:43,107
Teddy needs someone to come
in and clear out the cobwebs,

309
00:15:43,209 --> 00:15:44,942
and put a little
spring in her step.

310
00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:47,312
- Yeah, and father her children.
- Yeah.

311
00:15:47,414 --> 00:15:48,529
What? No, Mark?

312
00:15:48,631 --> 00:15:51,849
Yeah, he wants a wife and kids.

313
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:54,302
- I told her he was a candy bar.
- What?

314
00:15:54,404 --> 00:15:56,003
I didn't know!

315
00:15:58,558 --> 00:16:00,653
First she said no,
then she said yes.

316
00:16:00,677 --> 00:16:02,776
- That's good.
- And then she said no again.

317
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:07,080
Because she doesn't want to have
a meal with me. She just wanted sex.

318
00:16:07,182 --> 00:16:12,620
Who treats people like that?
Like an object. A piece of ass.

319
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:14,955
- I think you do.
- I've changed.

320
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:19,076
Dr. Sloan, Altman says if
you're scrubbing in, it's at two.

321
00:16:19,161 --> 00:16:21,012
Thanks, Karev.
You're a good man.

322
00:16:26,452 --> 00:16:28,419
- Hey.
- Not here.

323
00:16:28,521 --> 00:16:32,056
Sloan's going all psycho
killer on me. Smiles, crazy eyes.

324
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:33,941
I don't know what
the hell he's gonna do.

325
00:16:34,043 --> 00:16:36,543
What, I'm still his
property? I'll talk to him.

326
00:16:36,646 --> 00:16:39,146
Don't. I gotta
operate with the guy.

327
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:42,432
You mess with him, he
might stab me with a scalpel.

328
00:16:47,823 --> 00:16:49,606
- Mark's trying to kill Alex.
- What?

329
00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:52,009
I mentioned sleeping
with Alex was a bad idea.

330
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:55,813
No, it's not a bad idea.
It's happy and easy.

331
00:16:55,915 --> 00:16:58,232
You know how much
mental energy Mark took up?

332
00:16:58,334 --> 00:17:01,702
I'm telling you, ending it is the best
thing that could have happened to me.

333
00:17:01,804 --> 00:17:05,339
And for him! You know how much
happier he'd be if he could just move on?

334
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:08,320
Looked to me like he was
trying to pick up Teddy.

335
00:17:08,344 --> 00:17:11,595
Sure, he'll sleep with
her. He slept with Addison.

336
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:14,999
He'll screw anything that moves, but
I'm supposed to check into a convent?

337
00:17:15,101 --> 00:17:16,867
Why is he hanging on like this?

338
00:17:16,969 --> 00:17:18,819
You're just that
good, Little Grey.

339
00:17:18,921 --> 00:17:21,221
There's no getting over you.

340
00:17:23,092 --> 00:17:25,042
Oh!

341
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:27,361
You clear the room every
time. You clear the room.

342
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:31,049
Grey, Audrey Taylor's
getting a new set of scans.

343
00:17:31,151 --> 00:17:35,069
Have a look and see if there's anything
we need to include for the presentation.

344
00:17:35,171 --> 00:17:38,222
- How's the plan coming?
- Good. I think if
I clamp the aorta

345
00:17:38,324 --> 00:17:41,025
and vena cava above and
below the liver and porta hepatis,

346
00:17:41,127 --> 00:17:43,711
I should be able to
carve out the tumor.

347
00:17:43,813 --> 00:17:44,945
Interesting.

348
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:48,716
What's the word
from the other side?

349
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:50,551
From Dr. Webber?

350
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:54,789
Uh... Not much. He...

351
00:17:54,891 --> 00:17:58,392
- He's still kind of flailing.
- Flailing? Really?

352
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:00,594
Yeah. It's sad.

353
00:18:00,696 --> 00:18:03,397
You know, old guy.
End of the road.

354
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:05,967
Mmm-hmm. Webber doesn't flail.

355
00:18:06,069 --> 00:18:10,754
I'm gonna go and see if I can
help him come up with something.

356
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:14,825
- He flipped her.
- We have to get those scans

357
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,860
- before she does.
- Yeah. Let's go.

358
00:18:16,962 --> 00:18:19,313
Dr. Bailey, I'm
about to consult.

359
00:18:19,415 --> 00:18:20,626
Would you like to join me?

360
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:22,650
- Lunchtime.
- Yes.

361
00:18:22,752 --> 00:18:25,519
But in all the years I've known
you, I've never seen you eat.

362
00:18:25,621 --> 00:18:27,822
- I do things at lunchtime.
- What things?

363
00:18:27,924 --> 00:18:30,341
Errands! To the
dentist, get a haircut.

364
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:33,756
No, not a haircut. I'm going out!
Does that require interrogations?

365
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,658
Is that the kind of chief you want to
be, the kind of man you want to be?

366
00:18:36,682 --> 00:18:38,666
- No.
- I didn't think so!

367
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,953
Take a deep breath.

368
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,973
Hey, doc, my parents
got married really young.

369
00:18:47,076 --> 00:18:49,376
They hated each other
by the time I was born.

370
00:18:49,478 --> 00:18:51,529
Sorry to hear that.

371
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:53,430
Molly thinks
shacking up's all cute,

372
00:18:53,533 --> 00:18:58,135
but I don't think you play around with
something like that. People get hurt.

373
00:18:58,237 --> 00:19:01,238
- You don't need to explain.
- You think I'm a turd.

374
00:19:01,341 --> 00:19:04,208
And you're getting ready
to slice me open with a knife.

375
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:08,562
I'm sure you're not a turd.

376
00:19:11,667 --> 00:19:13,217
I think we found our problem.

377
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:15,686
Noah had a cyst on
his liver and it ruptured.

378
00:19:15,788 --> 00:19:18,489
- That's what's causing pain.
- Why would he have cysts?

379
00:19:18,591 --> 00:19:20,658
They can be
congenital or infectious.

380
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:21,809
They're usually benign,

381
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:23,393
but they can rupture
with pressure.

382
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:25,412
Pressure?

383
00:19:25,514 --> 00:19:27,831
What kind of pressure?
You mean like a fall?

384
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:29,600
- Did Noah take a fall today?
- No.

385
00:19:29,702 --> 00:19:31,847
The truth is it doesn't matter
what caused the rupture.

386
00:19:31,871 --> 00:19:34,149
- What matters is we operate right away.
- - Oh, my God.

387
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:37,542
Oh, my God! We
were doing bear hugs.

388
00:19:37,644 --> 00:19:40,578
We were... I... I hugged him.

389
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,513
I hugged him hard.

390
00:19:42,615 --> 00:19:45,199
That's when...
That's what did this?

391
00:19:46,853 --> 00:19:50,004
- Noah? What's happening?
- Grey, get an OR.

392
00:19:50,106 --> 00:19:51,338
We're going now.

393
00:19:56,528 --> 00:20:00,530
I've done this 300 times,
and it's still not working.

394
00:20:00,632 --> 00:20:02,800
I went to Eugenia.

395
00:20:03,503 --> 00:20:04,635
Hmm?

396
00:20:04,737 --> 00:20:07,355
She held up two postage
stamps and asked me

397
00:20:07,457 --> 00:20:10,858
if I was looking for
the 44 cent or the three.

398
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,693
You don't have to tell
me which you picked.

399
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:17,214
I left! Let me tell you something
about my surgical field.

400
00:20:17,316 --> 00:20:21,935
I prep my surgical field
with soap and water.

401
00:20:22,038 --> 00:20:25,039
I keep my surgical field
the way God made it.

402
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:29,844
I don't need a member of the
Ukrainian KGB waxing it smooth

403
00:20:29,946 --> 00:20:33,492
so it can be mistaken for the
surgical field of a five-year-old girl.

404
00:20:33,516 --> 00:20:37,401
I am a woman. And a woman
was meant to have something

405
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:40,304
on her surgical field.

406
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:44,107
If a man can't deal with a little
something on the surgical field,

407
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:47,010
a little nature, a little God,

408
00:20:47,112 --> 00:20:50,998
then that man has no business
getting near my surgical field.

409
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:54,735
Fine! I'm not putting a gun to
your head. Let freedom ring.

410
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:58,005
Damn it! This is not
supposed to be liquid.

411
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:06,747
What if I'm not
cut out for this?

412
00:21:06,849 --> 00:21:10,284
What if I'm no
longer patient enough

413
00:21:10,386 --> 00:21:13,103
or stupid enough to
deal with this crap?

414
00:21:19,796 --> 00:21:22,996
Come here. Come here. Come here.

415
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:29,887
You can do this. You
can do this. You can.

416
00:21:29,989 --> 00:21:31,888
This cyst was massive.

417
00:21:31,991 --> 00:21:35,058
We have to do a cholie 'cause
of the intrabiliary pressure.

418
00:21:35,161 --> 00:21:38,695
Should I update his parents? It's
gonna take a lot longer than we said.

419
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:40,681
Yeah, sure. Good idea.

420
00:21:40,783 --> 00:21:43,951
- What do I tell them?
- Doesn't matter.

421
00:21:44,053 --> 00:21:46,720
- I'm sorry?
- Until you can say he's awake

422
00:21:46,822 --> 00:21:48,400
and he's fine, they
won't hear a word.

423
00:21:48,424 --> 00:21:51,008
They'll just hear white noise
and see your mouth moving.

424
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:54,695
But go. It's good
for them to see you.

425
00:21:54,797 --> 00:21:57,157
Try to keep your face happy.

426
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:04,638
Jackson Avery.

427
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,201
- Put him on our team.
- You stacking the deck again?

428
00:22:06,225 --> 00:22:07,903
You're a spy. Don't
think I don't know.

429
00:22:07,927 --> 00:22:10,194
Who started that boulder
rolling down the hill?

430
00:22:10,296 --> 00:22:12,963
OK, I'm Switzerland in this
moment. All I'm saying is

431
00:22:13,066 --> 00:22:14,999
that whoever gets the
surgery should use him.

432
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,050
- Use me for what?
- He's a liability.

433
00:22:17,152 --> 00:22:19,953
Avery is not gonna give the
award to his own grandson.

434
00:22:20,055 --> 00:22:22,305
He won't be named a
contributor. It'll just get mentioned

435
00:22:22,408 --> 00:22:24,491
- that he worked...
- No, I won't.

436
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:25,904
On a tumor the size of a possum!

437
00:22:25,928 --> 00:22:27,944
- What's going on?
- They're fighting over me.

438
00:22:28,047 --> 00:22:29,791
Or more, the idea
of me. I don't...

439
00:22:29,815 --> 00:22:33,267
- He's Harper Avery bait.
- Derek's waiting for us.

440
00:22:35,121 --> 00:22:38,956
OK. Heart is back where
it came from. Dr. Sloan?

441
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:41,359
Two C's.

442
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:43,477
You're just gonna eyeball it?

443
00:22:43,579 --> 00:22:45,779
- This is what I do.
- If you say so.

444
00:22:45,881 --> 00:22:47,614
Syringe.

445
00:22:47,716 --> 00:22:51,802
Whoa! What? Are you
afraid I'm gonna stab you?

446
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:53,987
There's no needle.

447
00:22:54,089 --> 00:22:56,009
He's hypotensive.

448
00:22:56,058 --> 00:22:57,441
Your implant's on the vena cava.

449
00:22:57,543 --> 00:23:00,126
- There's too much fluid.
- No, there's not.

450
00:23:00,228 --> 00:23:01,779
I just need to reposition it.

451
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:03,663
Relax.

452
00:23:03,765 --> 00:23:05,048
Thank you.

453
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:08,285
An abdominal entry
is a shot in the dark.

454
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:12,423
The tumor has shoved everything
out of place, the anatomy's a mess.

455
00:23:12,525 --> 00:23:14,625
I'm proposing a
thoraco-abdominal approach.

456
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:18,429
- You want to go in
through the chest?
- It's risky, yes,

457
00:23:18,531 --> 00:23:22,883
but not as risky as "I'll open up the
abdomen and take a good look around."

458
00:23:22,985 --> 00:23:25,002
- Snap.
- You may end up seeding

459
00:23:25,087 --> 00:23:28,589
- the tumor in the lungs.
- That is a danger, yes.

460
00:23:32,194 --> 00:23:34,545
Impressive proposal.

461
00:23:34,647 --> 00:23:40,651
It's very... Hmm. I think I feel more
comfortable with Dr. Hunt's plan.

462
00:23:40,736 --> 00:23:44,622
He doesn't have a
plan. He has an attitude.

463
00:23:44,724 --> 00:23:46,451
It's more improvisational,

464
00:23:46,475 --> 00:23:49,243
but given our situation,
I think it's our best bet.

465
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,113
Thanks, all of you.

466
00:24:00,089 --> 00:24:01,821
Richard...

467
00:24:06,495 --> 00:24:07,962
I'm sorry. It was a good plan.

468
00:24:08,064 --> 00:24:10,030
Hunt's just makes
more sense to me.

469
00:24:10,149 --> 00:24:14,101
Yes, because that's the way
you'd do it. That's your style.

470
00:24:14,203 --> 00:24:17,721
Let me tell you
about your new job.

471
00:24:17,824 --> 00:24:20,507
You manage surgeons.

472
00:24:20,609 --> 00:24:23,377
Your job is to help
them do what they do,

473
00:24:23,478 --> 00:24:25,012
the way they do it.

474
00:24:25,114 --> 00:24:28,182
Not to get them to
do what you would do.

475
00:24:29,302 --> 00:24:33,720
It takes vision, Derek.
And you don't have it.

476
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,925
- BP's still low.
- Dr. Sloan.

477
00:24:42,949 --> 00:24:45,294
When people rush
you, does it usually help?

478
00:24:45,318 --> 00:24:46,912
It would be nice if
we don't let him die.

479
00:24:46,936 --> 00:24:48,080
I feel the same way.

480
00:24:48,104 --> 00:24:50,315
And you thought we
had nothing in common.

481
00:24:50,339 --> 00:24:53,624
- Pressure's coming back up.
- Imagine.

482
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:58,359
Dr. Sloan...

483
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:02,733
- nice work.
- What, that?

484
00:25:02,835 --> 00:25:04,768
It's just a hobby.

485
00:25:06,138 --> 00:25:07,738
Professionally,

486
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:11,141
I'm more focused on
my work as a male escort.

487
00:25:11,243 --> 00:25:16,113
We will isolate the tumor

488
00:25:16,215 --> 00:25:18,181
from the blood
vessels that supply it.

489
00:25:18,283 --> 00:25:21,852
And then try to extract it.

490
00:25:21,954 --> 00:25:25,956
That's the plan? You'll
try? Is that a plan?

491
00:25:26,058 --> 00:25:28,392
I wish that I could
be more specific,

492
00:25:28,494 --> 00:25:30,928
but until we know what
we're dealing with...

493
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:33,897
No, no, no! That's not a plan!

494
00:25:33,999 --> 00:25:35,916
- That's a death sentence.
- Audrey.

495
00:25:36,018 --> 00:25:39,620
Mrs. Taylor, if this works,
it is not just a month.

496
00:25:39,721 --> 00:25:41,988
- It is a long time.
- It's a gamble!

497
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:45,186
It's a huge one! You are gambling
away my daughter's wedding!

498
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:49,112
I'll call Kim right now. She'll
get a justice of the peace

499
00:25:49,215 --> 00:25:51,376
and she and Scott can get
married right here in this room

500
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,434
- and we can stop bothering...
- Don!

501
00:25:53,536 --> 00:25:57,221
You don't even like weddings!
The salmon will be too dry.

502
00:25:57,323 --> 00:25:58,923
The flowers will
make you sneeze.

503
00:25:59,025 --> 00:26:00,735
Kim will be angry at you
because women get angry

504
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:02,226
at their mothers
at their weddings.

505
00:26:02,328 --> 00:26:04,044
- That's how they handle stress.
- Stop it!

506
00:26:04,146 --> 00:26:06,647
Do you think she cares
about her wedding?

507
00:26:06,749 --> 00:26:09,983
- Her mother is dying!
- Don...

508
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,086
They're trying
to offer you a life.

509
00:26:13,188 --> 00:26:15,305
A whole long life.

510
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:17,340
No, they can't guarantee it.

511
00:26:17,443 --> 00:26:20,627
They're not gonna know what
they're gonna find. And it's a gamble.

512
00:26:20,729 --> 00:26:24,331
But how can you not take that
chance because of a wedding?

513
00:26:28,303 --> 00:26:32,739
There will be grandkids
and... and arguments

514
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:36,809
and God knows what else.
She'll need you for those.

515
00:26:38,981 --> 00:26:42,432
And I'll need you.

516
00:26:45,638 --> 00:26:47,654
Your husband's right.

517
00:26:49,191 --> 00:26:52,493
And so is Dr. Hunt.

518
00:26:52,595 --> 00:26:56,363
He can't foresee what
he'll find in surgery.

519
00:26:56,465 --> 00:26:58,765
But he'll solve
that as it comes.

520
00:26:59,534 --> 00:27:01,367
That's the plan.

521
00:27:02,688 --> 00:27:04,454
And it's a good one.

522
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,306
He did great.

523
00:27:23,408 --> 00:27:26,493
He's just coming out
from under anesthesia,

524
00:27:26,595 --> 00:27:28,878
and he's gonna be in
pain from the surgery,

525
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:32,066
- but he's gonna be fine.
- Is this gonna happen again?

526
00:27:32,168 --> 00:27:34,834
It's possible that he'll
develop cysts in the future.

527
00:27:34,936 --> 00:27:38,255
- You have to keep an eye out.
- This was... I hugged him.

528
00:27:38,357 --> 00:27:39,968
Do I not hug him?
Do we not wrestle?

529
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:41,870
You don't throw
him on the ground.

530
00:27:41,894 --> 00:27:45,446
He's a boy. He likes to
wrestle. It's not like I initiate it.

531
00:27:45,548 --> 00:27:49,316
Of course you hug
him. And you wrestle.

532
00:27:49,418 --> 00:27:52,186
You live your lives. And if he
happens to be in any great pain,

533
00:27:52,288 --> 00:27:53,932
- you know...
- So there isn't any kind

534
00:27:53,956 --> 00:27:55,133
of preventative thing...?

535
00:27:55,157 --> 00:27:58,041
- Please let her finish!
- It's OK.

536
00:27:59,929 --> 00:28:01,361
I was done.

537
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:04,698
Are you ready to see him?

538
00:28:18,881 --> 00:28:21,214
Somebody paged me here.

539
00:28:22,684 --> 00:28:23,850
Condoms.

540
00:28:26,088 --> 00:28:29,239
I'm building
cartilage from Jell-O,

541
00:28:29,341 --> 00:28:31,108
- and you paged me for...
- Condoms.

542
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:33,459
- They have them in the clinic!
- No, no.

543
00:28:33,561 --> 00:28:35,795
Am I supposed to bring them?

544
00:28:35,897 --> 00:28:38,265
Oh!

545
00:28:38,367 --> 00:28:42,435
Right. Yeah. Yeah... The
guy brings the condoms.

546
00:28:42,538 --> 00:28:44,771
Anyhow, I pegged you
for the diaphragm type.

547
00:28:44,874 --> 00:28:48,658
I have a diaphragm.
Diaphragms prevent pregnancy.

548
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:52,040
They don't protect against the
raft of sexually transmitted diseases.

549
00:28:52,114 --> 00:28:54,354
You are a physician. Am
I explaining this to you?

550
00:28:54,449 --> 00:28:57,083
I got it, I got it. OK, look.
Guy brings the condoms,

551
00:28:57,185 --> 00:29:00,937
but sometimes they fail to provide them
on the third date as a sign of respect.

552
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:04,057
"I never imagined this would
happen so soon. I wasn't prepared."

553
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:07,427
So you should bring them. Always
bring them. Why trust the guy?

554
00:29:07,529 --> 00:29:10,730
Right, right. All
right. All right.

555
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:12,616
- Torres.
- Hmm?

556
00:29:15,037 --> 00:29:16,047
Come on.

557
00:29:16,071 --> 00:29:17,755
- I can't.
- You can!

558
00:29:17,857 --> 00:29:20,185
Walk into the clinic and take
some condoms out of the box.

559
00:29:20,209 --> 00:29:21,992
Don't make me ask you twice.

560
00:29:22,094 --> 00:29:24,694
I'm having trouble
telling liver from tumor.

561
00:29:24,796 --> 00:29:26,830
Yep, you and me both.

562
00:29:26,932 --> 00:29:28,832
<i>Clamp.</i>

563
00:29:28,917 --> 00:29:31,785
Sorry you didn't end
up on the winning team.

564
00:29:31,887 --> 00:29:35,021
Sucks. You made a
ballsy play, though.

565
00:29:35,123 --> 00:29:38,208
- Thoraco-abdominal entry?
- I do what I can
to keep it fresh.

566
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:41,111
<i>- Bring in the CUSA.
- - Hang another unit of FFP.</i>

567
00:29:41,213 --> 00:29:43,680
<i>More lapse. More, more!</i>

568
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:47,084
- You need some help?
<i>- Where's Webber?</i>

569
00:29:47,186 --> 00:29:50,737
- You want me to scrub in?
- <i>I need Webber. Where's Webber?</i>

570
00:29:51,673 --> 00:29:54,007
I helped Altman
save her patient.

571
00:29:54,109 --> 00:29:55,275
I don't know why I bother.

572
00:29:55,377 --> 00:29:56,587
She thinks I'm a piece of meat.

573
00:29:56,611 --> 00:29:58,456
Plenty of women
dying to settle down.

574
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,891
You gotta move
on to the next one.

575
00:29:59,915 --> 00:30:02,415
Try what's-her-name in Derm.

576
00:30:02,517 --> 00:30:04,817
Dinner and
conversation. Can't wait.

577
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:08,054
- Who said dinner? Lunch.
- No. Lunch is not romantic.

578
00:30:08,156 --> 00:30:11,024
You don't want romantic,
you want daylight and public,

579
00:30:11,126 --> 00:30:12,603
so you can get to
know each other.

580
00:30:12,627 --> 00:30:14,627
That is the least sexy thing

581
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:16,374
- I've heard in my life.
- You've had sex.

582
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:18,949
- You want a baby.
- No way this works.

583
00:30:19,051 --> 00:30:21,284
Is it really possible
that you're this insecure?

584
00:30:21,386 --> 00:30:24,221
You're not just a sex machine.

585
00:30:24,323 --> 00:30:26,890
Don't get me wrong, you've got
skills, but you're a good person.

586
00:30:26,992 --> 00:30:29,392
Why do you think Little
Miss Muffet fell for you?

587
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:31,995
- Lexie left.
- 'Cause she was too young!

588
00:30:32,097 --> 00:30:34,748
It was about her, not you.

589
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:38,735
Wow. You really don't
believe any of this, do you?

590
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:42,239
Listen, you're a good guy.

591
00:30:42,341 --> 00:30:44,207
You're worth getting to know.

592
00:30:44,309 --> 00:30:46,142
In daylight.

593
00:30:49,864 --> 00:30:52,224
It's not gonna work, Dr. Hunt.

594
00:30:52,268 --> 00:30:53,900
The chest isn't an
option anymore,

595
00:30:54,002 --> 00:30:56,403
- this is what we've got.
- I'm not pitching my solution.

596
00:30:56,505 --> 00:30:58,600
I'm saying we
should think a minute.

597
00:30:58,624 --> 00:31:01,107
I've isolated the blood
supply and mobilized the liver,

598
00:31:01,209 --> 00:31:03,054
but I can't get enough
exposure to get to the tumor.

599
00:31:03,078 --> 00:31:05,946
What if we lift the liver
up, give you more visibility?

600
00:31:06,047 --> 00:31:09,850
That'd help with the periphery, but
I'd still have to deal with the vessels.

601
00:31:09,952 --> 00:31:12,835
I wish we could just
take the damn thing out.

602
00:31:14,106 --> 00:31:17,056
Well, why not? Let's
take the liver out.

603
00:31:17,159 --> 00:31:19,370
I can clean off
the tumor ex vivo,

604
00:31:19,394 --> 00:31:21,544
you can work on the
vascular supply in the cavity.

605
00:31:21,646 --> 00:31:23,780
- Will it work?
- No one's ever tried that.

606
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:25,326
She's crashing.

607
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:27,667
If you're trying
something, now's the time.

608
00:31:27,769 --> 00:31:32,005
Hunt?

609
00:31:32,107 --> 00:31:35,241
- OK, extracting the liver.
- More lapse.

610
00:31:36,461 --> 00:31:38,945
Suction, a lot
of suction. Hurry.

611
00:31:48,824 --> 00:31:51,686
Surgery went great. Everything
is back where it should be

612
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:54,077
- and Todd's gonna be fine.
- Oh, my God. Thank you.

613
00:31:54,179 --> 00:31:57,530
- Do you think I should see him?
- He's still groggy...

614
00:31:57,632 --> 00:32:01,034
I mean, do you think he wants
to see me after I stormed out?

615
00:32:01,136 --> 00:32:03,553
How did he seem?
Did he seem upset or...?

616
00:32:03,655 --> 00:32:06,956
I just... I love him.

617
00:32:07,058 --> 00:32:10,193
I was a little crazy. He practically
had a heart attack or whatever.

618
00:32:10,296 --> 00:32:12,296
I acted a little crazy.

619
00:32:14,166 --> 00:32:17,984
When you feel like you love
someone more than he loves you,

620
00:32:18,086 --> 00:32:23,890
it can make you a little crazy.
It can make you a lot crazy.

621
00:32:26,995 --> 00:32:30,129
You know, Webber really
came up with the idea

622
00:32:30,232 --> 00:32:31,398
to take out the liver.

623
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:34,418
Maybe if Owen agreed
to take his name off it...

624
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,602
Will you give it up?

625
00:32:35,704 --> 00:32:37,382
Hunt was more than halfway done

626
00:32:37,406 --> 00:32:39,117
by the time the
idea even surfaced.

627
00:32:39,141 --> 00:32:42,926
- There's no Harper Avery.
- Waste.

628
00:32:43,028 --> 00:32:45,262
No, it's not a waste.

629
00:32:45,363 --> 00:32:47,859
It's what my grandfather had in mind
when he came up with the stupid thing.

630
00:32:47,883 --> 00:32:50,817
Find some way to keep
surgeons motivated.

631
00:32:50,919 --> 00:32:52,496
Make them take
it to the next level,

632
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,465
even if they're already
at the top of their game.

633
00:32:54,489 --> 00:32:57,290
That's exactly
what it did today.

634
00:32:59,445 --> 00:33:02,896
This message was brought to you by
the Harper Avery Foundation of America.

635
00:33:02,998 --> 00:33:05,148
Donations to the Foundation
can be made at www...

636
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:06,878
You're kind of a
bitch, you know that?

637
00:33:06,902 --> 00:33:09,436
What? It was inspiring.

638
00:33:09,538 --> 00:33:12,049
Mrs. Taylor's gonna
need a post-op note.

639
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:13,073
I'll do it.

640
00:33:16,177 --> 00:33:18,377
Good work today,
Grey. We're a good team.

641
00:33:20,298 --> 00:33:22,632
You know, we're not a team.

642
00:33:22,735 --> 00:33:25,669
Cristina and I are a team.

643
00:33:25,771 --> 00:33:29,622
I watched you today
watch Teddy and Mark.

644
00:33:29,724 --> 00:33:33,693
She's my friend. And Mark
Sloan is a public health hazard.

645
00:33:33,795 --> 00:33:36,395
You were jealous.

646
00:33:36,498 --> 00:33:40,650
It took a long time to make her
happy, and she's finally happy.

647
00:33:40,752 --> 00:33:45,004
And if you mess with
that, I will turn on you.

648
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:47,457
That's a team.

649
00:34:10,949 --> 00:34:14,134
Maybe you should leave
this to the bioengineers.

650
00:34:14,236 --> 00:34:16,269
I tried it. They
said it won't work.

651
00:34:16,371 --> 00:34:18,491
Maybe that's
'cause it won't work.

652
00:34:18,573 --> 00:34:20,991
They're just not
invested in it like I am.

653
00:34:25,714 --> 00:34:29,582
Holy... It... It's not liquid.

654
00:34:29,684 --> 00:34:31,701
- Arizona, it's not liquid!
- Oh, my God!

655
00:34:31,803 --> 00:34:33,903
Oh, my God! Do you
know what you did?

656
00:34:34,005 --> 00:34:36,673
I don't know. I don't know.
I gotta... I gotta do it again.

657
00:34:38,043 --> 00:34:42,094
I'm on fire! And
it's not just this.

658
00:34:42,197 --> 00:34:44,997
Everyone came to me for
relationship advice today.

659
00:34:45,099 --> 00:34:49,018
And I gave them sane
and healthy advice.

660
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,721
Whether they take it or
not, I am seen as someone

661
00:34:51,823 --> 00:34:53,790
sane and healthy
enough to give advice.

662
00:34:53,892 --> 00:34:55,057
When I lived in the basement,

663
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:57,527
when I married
an intern in Vegas,

664
00:34:57,629 --> 00:34:59,311
I wasn't seen that way.

665
00:35:01,082 --> 00:35:02,816
You're amazing.

666
00:35:03,835 --> 00:35:04,868
We're amazing.

667
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:06,970
We're the stable couple now.

668
00:35:07,072 --> 00:35:08,838
We're the one
everyone wants to be.

669
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:11,575
I can just see us ten years
from now in a big old house

670
00:35:11,676 --> 00:35:15,979
with kids running around,
giving sage, sane advice.

671
00:35:16,081 --> 00:35:18,748
To Mark Sloan, who
will still be single.

672
00:35:20,152 --> 00:35:21,812
I'm in it for all but the kids.

673
00:35:21,836 --> 00:35:22,853
What?

674
00:35:22,955 --> 00:35:25,054
No kids. And by
no, I mean yikes!

675
00:35:25,156 --> 00:35:27,807
No to the kids.

676
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:30,093
You're joking, right?
You're in pediatrics.

677
00:35:30,195 --> 00:35:32,012
Yeah. Exactly.

678
00:35:32,114 --> 00:35:34,274
This kid Noah comes in
today, he's fine one minute,

679
00:35:34,349 --> 00:35:37,812
then his mom gives him a hug
and he lands in my OR, nearly dead.

680
00:35:37,836 --> 00:35:41,471
- But you saved him.
- Yeah. But his parents?

681
00:35:41,573 --> 00:35:44,941
They're... They're a mess.
They'll never sleep well again.

682
00:35:45,043 --> 00:35:46,323
Mm-mm...

683
00:35:46,961 --> 00:35:49,629
But the big house, I'm in.

684
00:35:49,731 --> 00:35:52,031
And can we have
dogs? And chickens!

685
00:35:52,133 --> 00:35:55,101
I have this weird
thing for chickens.

686
00:36:16,091 --> 00:36:17,635
I'd love to have
dinner sometime.

687
00:36:17,659 --> 00:36:19,909
If you're still up for it.

688
00:36:22,113 --> 00:36:24,080
I'm not taking you to dinner.

689
00:36:24,616 --> 00:36:25,915
Oh.

690
00:36:27,785 --> 00:36:29,836
I will take you to lunch.

691
00:36:30,772 --> 00:36:34,207
Saturday afternoon,
in broad daylight.

692
00:36:34,309 --> 00:36:36,376
We'll eat at a public place,

693
00:36:36,478 --> 00:36:39,412
and maybe take a walk
on a crowded street.

694
00:36:40,315 --> 00:36:42,082
We'll get to know each other,

695
00:36:42,184 --> 00:36:45,518
and see if we have an interest
in the same kind of future.

696
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:50,240
Because I want to build a life,

697
00:36:50,342 --> 00:36:54,511
and a family, and I'm
not wasting my time

698
00:36:54,612 --> 00:36:57,180
on someone who
doesn't share that interest.

699
00:37:02,554 --> 00:37:04,120
I'll pick you up at noon.

700
00:37:07,509 --> 00:37:09,125
OK, then.

701
00:37:16,117 --> 00:37:18,468
I used to grill.

702
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:19,835
You're out in the air,

703
00:37:19,938 --> 00:37:22,472
you got a slab of beef,
it's a masculine activity.

704
00:37:22,574 --> 00:37:24,301
But you ever try
to grill in Seattle?

705
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:25,775
I haven't.

706
00:37:25,861 --> 00:37:27,404
You're standing
around in the rain.

707
00:37:27,428 --> 00:37:29,607
In a raincoat with the hood up.

708
00:37:29,631 --> 00:37:33,466
Let me tell you, there's nothing manly
about a hood and a soggy slab of beef.

709
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:35,001
OK, here's the thing.

710
00:37:35,103 --> 00:37:37,987
I don't do things
because there's a timeline.

711
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:41,657
I don't do things because
it's the third anything.

712
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:43,759
I may have been out of
the dating game for a while,

713
00:37:43,845 --> 00:37:49,015
but I don't play by anyone's
rules other than my own.

714
00:37:49,117 --> 00:37:52,185
So whatever expectations

715
00:37:52,286 --> 00:37:55,338
you walked into
this evening with...

716
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,890
- Are you lecturing me?
- No, I'm...

717
00:37:57,992 --> 00:38:00,743
No, you are. You lecture people.

718
00:38:00,846 --> 00:38:02,590
I think most people
are scared of you.

719
00:38:02,614 --> 00:38:05,348
So nobody's willing to interrupt
you once you get on a roll.

720
00:38:05,433 --> 00:38:09,552
But I'm not scared of you. So
the lecture thing's not gonna work.

721
00:38:09,637 --> 00:38:12,271
We gonna have to
have a conversation.

722
00:38:13,975 --> 00:38:15,725
Don't worry. Ask me a question.

723
00:38:15,827 --> 00:38:19,145
Then I'll answer, then
you get another turn.

724
00:38:19,247 --> 00:38:21,063
Go ahead.

725
00:38:24,152 --> 00:38:27,486
Are you under the impression
that we're going to have sex tonight?

726
00:38:27,589 --> 00:38:30,190
- Because if that's the case...
- Ask the question.

727
00:38:30,291 --> 00:38:33,292
Don't answer the question.
I'll answer the question.

728
00:38:35,847 --> 00:38:39,932
No, I'm not assuming
we'll have sex tonight.

729
00:38:40,034 --> 00:38:43,531
You're a grown woman. Neither of
us is looking for something trashy.

730
00:38:43,555 --> 00:38:47,423
So I kinda thought third
date was a little early.

731
00:38:47,525 --> 00:38:51,494
- What do you think?
- Me, too. I...

732
00:38:53,281 --> 00:38:55,664
Can I make a statement
or just questions?

733
00:38:55,766 --> 00:38:57,066
A statement is fine.

734
00:38:57,168 --> 00:39:00,587
I...

735
00:39:01,456 --> 00:39:02,888
Uh...

736
00:39:02,991 --> 00:39:06,126
have never had sex with
anyone other than my husband.

737
00:39:06,228 --> 00:39:07,594
Former husband.

738
00:39:10,448 --> 00:39:12,782
So it's not something
you get into lightly.

739
00:39:12,884 --> 00:39:14,784
No.

740
00:39:15,887 --> 00:39:17,103
Neither do I.

741
00:39:18,924 --> 00:39:20,389
What else?

742
00:39:23,195 --> 00:39:26,079
When do you think
is the right time?

743
00:39:27,582 --> 00:39:29,927
I like to think we'll
know it when we see it.

744
00:39:29,951 --> 00:39:32,311
Probably somewhere
between date eight and date 12.

745
00:39:32,387 --> 00:39:36,989
Oh... No concern we'll
end up just friends?

746
00:39:37,091 --> 00:39:39,526
Is that what you're looking for?

747
00:39:39,628 --> 00:39:43,213
- No.
- Me neither.

748
00:39:44,149 --> 00:39:45,832
Look, um...

749
00:39:47,668 --> 00:39:50,028
I don't want to be your friend.

750
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:53,539
I have enough friends.

751
00:39:57,278 --> 00:39:59,645
<i>They take pictures
of mountain climbers</i>

752
00:39:59,747 --> 00:40:01,513
<i>at the top of the mountain.</i>

753
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:04,016
<i>They're smiling,</i>

754
00:40:04,118 --> 00:40:08,104
<i>ecstatic, triumphant.</i>

755
00:40:10,709 --> 00:40:13,927
Richard, I understand
your patient's doing well.

756
00:40:14,029 --> 00:40:15,361
Hunt's patient.

757
00:40:15,463 --> 00:40:19,465
He says he couldn't
have done it without you.

758
00:40:19,567 --> 00:40:21,451
- I'm sorry I didn't...
- Don't.

759
00:40:21,553 --> 00:40:22,553
You were doing your job.

760
00:40:22,587 --> 00:40:25,938
- It isn't easy.
- True.

761
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,985
I'm not necessarily
all that good at it yet.

762
00:40:28,009 --> 00:40:33,546
- No, you're not.
- Really?

763
00:40:33,648 --> 00:40:37,867
You couldn't give me
one kind word? Not one?

764
00:40:37,952 --> 00:40:40,064
<i>They don't take
pictures along the way.</i>

765
00:40:40,088 --> 00:40:43,005
<i>'Cause who wants to
remember the rest of it?</i>

766
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:46,241
<i>We push ourselves
because we have to.</i>

767
00:40:46,344 --> 00:40:48,110
<i>Not because we like it.</i>

768
00:40:48,212 --> 00:40:50,963
Hey. How was Mark?
Did he do anything?

769
00:40:51,065 --> 00:40:52,209
He was totally cool.

770
00:40:52,233 --> 00:40:54,733
I think he's into
Altman, though.

771
00:40:54,835 --> 00:40:59,038
Teddy? Come on. He's trying
to make me think he's moving on.

772
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:01,908
No, it looked real. He
wants to take her to lunch.

773
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:04,622
He's all like, "Let's take it slow
and get to know each other."

774
00:41:04,646 --> 00:41:06,395
I think she went for it.

775
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:17,907
Hey.

776
00:41:19,694 --> 00:41:22,144
- You OK?
- Yeah.

777
00:41:23,114 --> 00:41:25,114
Mark's moving on.

778
00:41:25,216 --> 00:41:27,783
Like, really.

779
00:41:28,553 --> 00:41:31,437
OK. Well, that's good, isn't it?

780
00:41:31,539 --> 00:41:34,073
Isn't that what you wanted?

781
00:41:35,243 --> 00:41:37,076
No, it's... It's great.

782
00:41:37,178 --> 00:41:39,212
It's... That's...
That's perfect.

783
00:41:39,313 --> 00:41:40,980
It's...

784
00:41:41,883 --> 00:41:43,482
It's perfect.

785
00:41:43,601 --> 00:41:45,618
<i>The relentless climb...</i>

786
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,737
Oh...

787
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:51,140
<i>the pain and anguish of
taking it to the next level...</i>

788
00:41:52,644 --> 00:41:54,793
<i>nobody takes pictures of that.</i>

789
00:41:57,648 --> 00:42:00,516
<i>Nobody wants to remember.</i>

790
00:42:00,618 --> 00:42:03,219
<i>We just wanna remember
the view from the top.</i>

791
00:42:03,321 --> 00:42:06,756
<i>The breathtaking moment
at the edge of the world.</i>

792
00:42:07,725 --> 00:42:10,109
<i>That's what keeps us climbing.</i>

793
00:42:11,029 --> 00:42:12,945
<i>And it's worth the pain.</i>

794
00:42:14,348 --> 00:42:16,215
<i>That's the crazy part.</i>

795
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:20,619
<i>It's worth anything.</i>
