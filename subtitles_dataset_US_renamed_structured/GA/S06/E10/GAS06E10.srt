1
00:00:05,106 --> 00:00:08,974
<i>The best gift I ever got was
for Christmas when I was 10:</i>

2
00:00:09,076 --> 00:00:11,843
<i>My very first suture kit.</i>

3
00:00:11,945 --> 00:00:13,712
<i>I used it until my fingers bled,</i>

4
00:00:13,814 --> 00:00:17,016
<i>and then I tried to use
it to stitch up my fingers.</i>

5
00:00:18,052 --> 00:00:19,567
Thank you for meeting me.

6
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:22,354
You're the chief of
surgery. If you page I'm here.

7
00:00:22,456 --> 00:00:26,658
<i>It put me on the path
to becoming a surgeon.</i>

8
00:00:30,698 --> 00:00:33,031
I want to say something.

9
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:35,667
I need to say something

10
00:00:35,769 --> 00:00:41,856
about what happened the other
night. I need you to know it wasn't...

11
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:44,276
Well, it isn't what you think.

12
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:50,632
Oh, I don't think anything
about your personal life, sir.

13
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:59,541
I had a problem,
a long time ago.

14
00:00:59,643 --> 00:01:04,646
I was diagnosed with
alcoholism. Or I diagnosed myself,

15
00:01:04,748 --> 00:01:08,133
and I didn't take a
drink for almost 20 years.

16
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:10,936
But I think it was
a misdiagnosis.

17
00:01:11,038 --> 00:01:13,805
I'm not saying my drinking
wasn't bad, because it was.

18
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:19,778
But there is such a thing
as... situational depression,

19
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,913
and I think that's what
I was suffering from,

20
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:24,432
and it escalated my drinking.

21
00:01:25,903 --> 00:01:28,620
Situational depression?

22
00:01:28,722 --> 00:01:32,807
- Your mother.
- Yes, she escalated
my drinking too.

23
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:41,649
Have you told anyone what
you saw? Have you told Derek?

24
00:01:42,819 --> 00:01:45,737
No. No.

25
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:51,943
Since I took a step
back from surgery,

26
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:56,982
I've had some time to
really look at our residents.

27
00:01:57,084 --> 00:02:02,154
And your work,
your raw talent...

28
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:06,291
is extraordinary.

29
00:02:07,811 --> 00:02:10,228
A lot like your mother's.

30
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:16,034
And since I have some
time, some extra time, um...

31
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:23,158
maybe you would like a mentor.

32
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:25,226
Maybe I could teach
you some things.

33
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:32,184
Have you ever done a two-layered
continuous suture for an anastomosis?

34
00:02:32,286 --> 00:02:33,651
<i>My point is,</i>

35
00:02:33,753 --> 00:02:37,922
<i>sometimes the best gifts come
in really surprising packages.</i>

36
00:02:38,025 --> 00:02:39,491
No.

37
00:02:39,593 --> 00:02:41,126
Take a seat.

38
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:48,200
You're about to.

39
00:02:58,061 --> 00:02:59,761
Wait.

40
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:03,565
Oh, it's Teddy. I love
it when it's Teddy.

41
00:03:03,667 --> 00:03:05,199
OK.

42
00:03:10,006 --> 00:03:12,206
Don't you think it's strange
he's mentoring you at night

43
00:03:12,276 --> 00:03:13,809
and still not talking to me?

44
00:03:13,911 --> 00:03:16,961
Since the merger, it is
impossible to get OR time.

45
00:03:17,064 --> 00:03:19,831
- And who is
responsible for that?
- That's what I'm saying.

46
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:23,435
- I need all the help I can get.
- I say he is using you
to get to me.

47
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:25,571
- He is not!
- Then why now?

48
00:03:25,673 --> 00:03:27,573
Why are you suddenly
seeing so much of him?

49
00:03:27,675 --> 00:03:29,552
I'm done talking about this.

50
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:33,311
If you want to stay mad, stay mad,
but I'm just gonna be here kissing you.

51
00:03:37,201 --> 00:03:40,819
Oh, my God! That is the biggest
pseudoaneurysm I've ever seen.

52
00:03:40,904 --> 00:03:43,755
It's at the suture line of the
transplant. Her new heart is dying.

53
00:03:43,857 --> 00:03:45,624
- Damn it!
- Poor guy that brought her in,

54
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:47,536
I think they were
on their third date.

55
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,277
Doesn't look like
a heart anymore.

56
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:50,846
That's because it's not.

57
00:03:50,948 --> 00:03:53,292
It's a chunk of useless flesh
that has to come out right now.

58
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:57,102
You're taking the heart out?
What are you gonna replace it with?

59
00:03:57,587 --> 00:03:58,587
I don't know.

60
00:03:58,689 --> 00:04:00,922
We're gonna have to
figure it out as we go.

61
00:04:05,512 --> 00:04:08,746
OK, wait, let me get this
straight. You removed her heart?

62
00:04:08,848 --> 00:04:11,499
- Yes.
- - And she can live that way?

63
00:04:11,601 --> 00:04:13,535
Like, what? Like a vampire?

64
00:04:13,637 --> 00:04:16,566
Usually you'd connect a
ventricular assist device to the heart,

65
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:17,750
but since she
doesn't have a heart...

66
00:04:17,774 --> 00:04:20,359
Dr. Altman attached
two, um, devices

67
00:04:20,461 --> 00:04:21,927
to her blood vessels.

68
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:24,896
This machine now pumps
the blood through her body,

69
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:27,282
which is basically,
um, a miracle.

70
00:04:27,384 --> 00:04:31,686
I really like her... I like her a
lot, but we've only had four dates.

71
00:04:31,788 --> 00:04:34,789
I'm supposed to have Thanksgiving
with my family, you know?

72
00:04:34,892 --> 00:04:38,477
She was gonna join us,
and now she's like a...

73
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,346
She can really
live without a heart?

74
00:04:41,431 --> 00:04:45,233
If you don't want to stay, we have
a great nursing staff, great doctors.

75
00:04:45,335 --> 00:04:46,785
She'll be in good hands.

76
00:04:46,887 --> 00:04:50,472
No, you know? She
doesn't even have a family.

77
00:04:50,574 --> 00:04:54,475
And if it was me, I would want
somebody here, so I'll stay.

78
00:04:57,614 --> 00:04:59,114
OK.

79
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:04,603
Tucker and Little
Tuck are both fine.

80
00:05:04,705 --> 00:05:10,074
I know, I'm sorry I have to work
today and on Christmas this year.

81
00:05:10,177 --> 00:05:15,146
Yeah, Tucker and I were hoping
to bring him home to visit you.

82
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:17,198
Mom, um, I have to go.

83
00:05:17,934 --> 00:05:20,035
Happy Thanksgiving, Mom.

84
00:05:20,137 --> 00:05:22,020
You didn't tell your
parents about the divorce?

85
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:25,730
How long are you
gonna keep that a secret?

86
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,359
When you started dating women,
how long did you keep that secret?

87
00:05:31,781 --> 00:05:33,782
- OK.
- What?

88
00:05:33,884 --> 00:05:35,061
When did the bleeding start?

89
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:37,318
This morning. He's
had these before.

90
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:40,739
I just... I've never seen a
nosebleed go on like this.

91
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:42,641
There's blood on Timmy, Mom.

92
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:45,510
Mr. and Mrs. Jacobsen,
can I see you?

93
00:05:45,612 --> 00:05:47,612
Go ahead. We'll be fine.

94
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:50,632
Nicholas has what is called
an arteriovenous malformation.

95
00:05:50,734 --> 00:05:54,080
A cluster of tangled blood vessels in
his brain, what's causing the bleeding.

96
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:56,671
In order to stop the bleeding,
we need to remove it.

97
00:05:56,774 --> 00:05:58,539
You mean like
brain surgery or...?

98
00:05:58,642 --> 00:06:01,554
I'll do everything I can to protect
the brain tissue and minimize damage.

99
00:06:01,578 --> 00:06:06,030
I'm sorry. I know it's scary,
but we have to go in right away.

100
00:06:17,227 --> 00:06:18,592
Excuse me.

101
00:06:18,695 --> 00:06:21,240
I'm looking for Dr. Mark Sloan.

102
00:06:21,264 --> 00:06:24,427
Um, see the dude who was
burned trying to deep-fry a turkey?

103
00:06:24,451 --> 00:06:26,985
Sloan's the guy making
him scream like a girl.

104
00:06:32,876 --> 00:06:35,043
- Dr. Sloan?
- Yeah.

105
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:41,115
Hi. Uh, so this is a
little weird, but, um...

106
00:06:41,218 --> 00:06:45,219
my name is Sloan Reilly, and
my mom's Samantha Reilly.

107
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:48,390
And, um... I'm pretty
sure you're my dad.

108
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,799
Hi. How's it, uh...
going in here?

109
00:07:13,901 --> 00:07:15,917
- Great.
- Fine.

110
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:17,986
OK. So...

111
00:07:18,088 --> 00:07:20,739
have we broached the
question about the paternity test?

112
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:24,342
'Cause I brought supplies.

113
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:27,579
She's 18. That's not very
much younger than me.

114
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,032
It's not that shocking, actually. The
way Mark got around before he met you?

115
00:07:31,134 --> 00:07:35,102
There could be a gaggle of
Sloans. Sloan Jones, Sloan Smith,

116
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:36,671
Sloan Sloan.

117
00:07:36,773 --> 00:07:38,013
Mean.

118
00:07:39,726 --> 00:07:41,259
Oh, damn it.

119
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:43,478
Son of a bitch.

120
00:07:45,165 --> 00:07:46,948
I can't access the feeders.

121
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:49,284
So what does that mean?

122
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:52,136
It means I can't get at it.
I can do a temporary fix.

123
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:54,439
But once he starts
bleeding again, which he will,

124
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:56,908
there won't be
anything we can do.

125
00:07:57,010 --> 00:08:00,378
So we're just gonna
send him home to die?

126
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:05,773
Happy Thanksgiving,
Jacobsen family.

127
00:08:15,562 --> 00:08:17,829
- Nice day.
- A little chilly.

128
00:08:17,931 --> 00:08:20,565
Yeah.

129
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:26,004
- It's brisk, though. It's not cold.
- Right.

130
00:08:35,865 --> 00:08:37,548
Look, Teddy...

131
00:08:38,585 --> 00:08:40,618
No. I know.

132
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:46,140
I don't... I don't understand.

133
00:08:46,242 --> 00:08:48,993
You said that he would
die without the surgery,

134
00:08:49,096 --> 00:08:51,813
and now you're telling us we're
supposed to just take him home?

135
00:08:51,915 --> 00:08:53,876
Well, I've stopped the
bleeding temporarily,

136
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:57,212
but the only way to remove the
AVM safely is through the sinus.

137
00:08:57,236 --> 00:08:58,636
Why don't you do that?

138
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:01,434
There are no instruments that
can maneuver through a nasal cavity

139
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,419
this small and get
the appropriate angles.

140
00:09:03,443 --> 00:09:05,977
Why not? Who does that?

141
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:08,262
Who invents those things?

142
00:09:12,452 --> 00:09:14,235
Mark.

143
00:09:14,337 --> 00:09:17,238
Now might be a good place
for you to say something.

144
00:09:19,092 --> 00:09:21,593
Out loud.

145
00:09:21,695 --> 00:09:24,175
Dude, are you, like,
high or something?

146
00:09:24,865 --> 00:09:26,159
- Sloan...
- Yeah!

147
00:09:26,183 --> 00:09:29,200
- Yes?
- Heh. Mark,
I need you on something.

148
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:32,404
I have a daughter, Derek,
an 18-year-old daughter.

149
00:09:32,506 --> 00:09:34,805
I am too young to
have an 18-year-old.

150
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:38,743
It's a nail in my coffin. It's
like death has come to call.

151
00:09:38,845 --> 00:09:41,557
OK, can we put a pin in your
existential crisis for a minute?

152
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,031
No. That's why
they call it a crisis.

153
00:09:43,133 --> 00:09:46,362
Dr. Robbins and I have a
six-year-old with an inoperable AVM.

154
00:09:46,386 --> 00:09:48,826
We need your help
to make it operable.

155
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:53,474
This is the best
Thanksgiving ever.

156
00:09:53,576 --> 00:09:56,595
No obnoxious relatives,
no stupid traditions.

157
00:09:56,697 --> 00:09:59,424
No going around the table and
saying what you're grateful for.

158
00:09:59,448 --> 00:10:03,268
I think we should do the opposite:
talk about what we're not grateful for.

159
00:10:04,787 --> 00:10:06,854
- The merger.
- The Mercy Westers.

160
00:10:06,956 --> 00:10:09,591
They're like the plague. I
mean, stealing all our surgeries,

161
00:10:09,693 --> 00:10:11,392
eating all that pie
in the nurses station.

162
00:10:11,494 --> 00:10:13,454
- You're doing that wrong.
- I am not.

163
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:14,810
You are. Can I show you?

164
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,534
Private lessons with the chief.

165
00:10:19,636 --> 00:10:22,187
Man, those daddy
issues are working for you.

166
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:24,805
I don't have daddy
issues. He's teaching me.

167
00:10:24,908 --> 00:10:27,536
- You're his bitch.
- In that case,
you're Teddy's bitch.

168
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,794
Maybe that's my
problem. I'm nobody's bitch.

169
00:10:29,896 --> 00:10:31,946
You were Izzie's bitch.

170
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:34,343
- You're the bitch.
- You know what? It's Thanksgiving.

171
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:37,351
- Can we just have
no name-calling?
- Yeah, please.

172
00:10:37,453 --> 00:10:39,403
Just... Show me
that stitch again.

173
00:10:46,162 --> 00:10:47,682
- Hey!
- Hey.

174
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:50,364
Hey.

175
00:10:50,466 --> 00:10:51,911
- Hi.
- Hello.

176
00:10:51,935 --> 00:10:55,970
Welcome. Happy
Thanksgiving. Who wants wine?

177
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:57,632
- I do.
- No, you don't.

178
00:10:58,274 --> 00:11:01,025
Um... Hey, everybody.

179
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:03,344
Well, the results are in.

180
00:11:03,446 --> 00:11:08,899
It, uh, turns out Sloan was
right about her parentage.

181
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:10,985
I am her dad.

182
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:14,639
So here's another
thing to be thankful for.

183
00:11:14,741 --> 00:11:20,028
Lexie, Sloan here is gonna
move in with us for a little while.

184
00:11:24,651 --> 00:11:26,201
- Oh, my God!
- Oh!

185
00:11:28,171 --> 00:11:29,337
Ouch.

186
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:38,663
Just ease up.

187
00:11:38,765 --> 00:11:40,843
Let the suture do
the work for you.

188
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:42,878
It's like a dance, you know.

189
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:45,737
You let the needle be
the man, let it take the lead

190
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:49,340
and let your hand just follow.

191
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:52,410
Look at that. I haven't
seen skill like that since...

192
00:11:53,747 --> 00:11:58,332
since your mother. That
woman, she could dance.

193
00:12:00,403 --> 00:12:04,572
You should make up with
Derek. It's Christmas, it's time.

194
00:12:06,709 --> 00:12:12,062
You need to take perpendicular
bites, about a millimeter apart.

195
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:18,636
- How's it feel? Still tingling?
- Oh, it's fine.

196
00:12:18,721 --> 00:12:22,440
- I pretty much have
full sensation.
- Great. Good.

197
00:12:23,777 --> 00:12:27,278
So... Have you...?

198
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:32,050
I mean, you think you can ask
her how long she's planning to stay?

199
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,019
Mark, it's been a month,

200
00:12:35,104 --> 00:12:37,383
and you've exchanged
three sentences with her.

201
00:12:37,407 --> 00:12:39,252
Two of them were,
"Pass the cereal."

202
00:12:39,276 --> 00:12:43,110
In the spirit of the holiday,
maybe you can ask her yourself.

203
00:12:43,212 --> 00:12:45,574
She's pretty easy to like
once you get to know her.

204
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,731
Really?

205
00:12:47,834 --> 00:12:52,253
No. She's a vapid, vapid girl,
but she's your daughter, OK?

206
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:56,123
So try. OK? Try to be her dad.

207
00:12:57,927 --> 00:13:00,344
Go.

208
00:13:06,769 --> 00:13:09,336
What are you looking
at, you old perv?

209
00:13:13,743 --> 00:13:16,977
- Dad!
- Merry Christmas.

210
00:13:19,315 --> 00:13:22,500
- Your mother sent me.
- Oh. You heard.

211
00:13:22,602 --> 00:13:26,137
Your cousin said something to
her husband in front of your niece,

212
00:13:26,239 --> 00:13:30,407
who said something to your younger
niece who said something to your mother.

213
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:37,030
- I was planning
to put a tree up...
- And where's Tuck?

214
00:13:37,133 --> 00:13:40,618
He's back East with Tucker's family.
He was with me for Thanksgiving.

215
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,038
So it's true. You
are getting a divorce.

216
00:13:49,044 --> 00:13:50,244
It's weird.

217
00:13:51,314 --> 00:13:53,764
No heartbeat.

218
00:13:53,867 --> 00:13:56,000
I used to climb
mountains, you know.

219
00:13:56,102 --> 00:14:00,354
One time I did the Inca Trail.
It's four mountains in three days.

220
00:14:00,456 --> 00:14:05,209
The second day there was this
climb, it's eight hours straight,

221
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:10,314
and you are so tired and the
air is so thin, you don't even talk.

222
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:12,233
All you do is climb.

223
00:14:12,335 --> 00:14:16,437
And it's just you
and your breathing

224
00:14:16,539 --> 00:14:19,624
and your heartbeat
pounding in your ears.

225
00:14:19,726 --> 00:14:23,010
It's just hard getting
used to no heartbeat.

226
00:14:26,048 --> 00:14:28,082
And I'm getting tired.

227
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:32,820
Really tired.

228
00:14:32,922 --> 00:14:35,256
I know.

229
00:14:35,358 --> 00:14:37,908
You know what? You just need
to hang on until New Year's Eve.

230
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:42,012
There's a lot of drunk drivers, a
lot of brain death. It's organpalooza.

231
00:14:44,867 --> 00:14:48,352
Kelsey, you just
gotta hang on, OK?

232
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:50,988
You'll hike again, you know?

233
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:53,271
We'll hike together.

234
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:56,727
It's such a beautiful
world outside this hospital.

235
00:14:56,829 --> 00:15:01,181
It's snowy and quiet, cold.

236
00:15:02,135 --> 00:15:03,568
And perfect.

237
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:07,838
So, you know, you just gotta
make it until New Year's Eve.

238
00:15:10,176 --> 00:15:13,077
- I need to go outside.
- What?

239
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:17,681
I might die, we all know
that. I might die really soon.

240
00:15:17,767 --> 00:15:22,269
But snow is my favorite
thing in the whole wide world.

241
00:15:23,139 --> 00:15:24,605
It's my favorite thing.

242
00:15:26,543 --> 00:15:27,892
Please.

243
00:15:28,611 --> 00:15:29,994
Please, OK?

244
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:32,696
- I'm sorry, but...
- We can do that.

245
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:38,886
We can do that.

246
00:15:41,657 --> 00:15:46,393
I wanna bolt. I want to quit, I
want to... go back to New York

247
00:15:46,495 --> 00:15:48,996
or... I don't know, Arkansas.

248
00:15:49,098 --> 00:15:51,649
Somewhere no one
can come looking for me.

249
00:15:51,751 --> 00:15:55,936
I don't know how to talk to her. I
don't know what she wants from me.

250
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:59,056
It's the guilt, you know?

251
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:02,093
It's how every time
I look at her I just...

252
00:16:02,195 --> 00:16:04,912
The guilt is like a punch
in the gut every day.

253
00:16:05,014 --> 00:16:07,481
Well, you shouldn't feel
guilty. You didn't know.

254
00:16:09,318 --> 00:16:11,385
I did know.

255
00:16:11,487 --> 00:16:14,438
I knew when her
mom got pregnant.

256
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:17,925
She told me. I gave her a couple
hundred bucks and I left town.

257
00:16:18,027 --> 00:16:22,346
I never saw her again. I
figured she got an abortion.

258
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:23,948
Hoped.

259
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:27,318
But I did know.

260
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:32,022
Well, you're a different guy
now. You're not 18 anymore.

261
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:36,427
You've grown up.
You're capable of better.

262
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:38,649
Nicholas is back in the ER.
He's got a nosebleed, bad.

263
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:39,875
I've tried to stop
it for an hour.

264
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:41,810
We can't operate.
We're not ready.

265
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,568
Then I'll admit him and keep
transfusing 'til the equipment's done,

266
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,837
which is gonna be soon, I hope?

267
00:16:53,213 --> 00:16:55,879
Um, hello. Are you Bailey's...
I mean, Miranda's dad?

268
00:16:55,981 --> 00:16:58,849
William Bailey.
You can call me Bill.

269
00:16:58,951 --> 00:17:01,118
OK. Hi, Bill.

270
00:17:01,221 --> 00:17:03,453
I'm Callie Torres,
I'm a friend of Bailey's.

271
00:17:03,556 --> 00:17:06,790
She mentioned that she snuck you
in here, said I should come say hi.

272
00:17:06,892 --> 00:17:11,446
- So what's that
she's doing down there?
- That's a hernia repair.

273
00:17:11,548 --> 00:17:13,075
We get a lot of
hernias at Christmas.

274
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:18,251
Lots of people lifting trees
or heavy gifts or Santa bags.

275
00:17:18,354 --> 00:17:22,123
It's... We get a lot of broken
bones, too, 'cause of the weather.

276
00:17:22,224 --> 00:17:24,409
Oh, I had this,
uh, this guy earlier,

277
00:17:24,511 --> 00:17:26,660
he got an electric shock
from some Christmas lights.

278
00:17:26,762 --> 00:17:29,896
The shock was so big that
it broke both of his wrists.

279
00:17:29,999 --> 00:17:31,326
- Whoa.
- Yeah.

280
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:35,820
- Anyway,
I'm dating women, and...
- I'm sorry?

281
00:17:36,873 --> 00:17:39,923
Oh, I'm... I recently
started dating women,

282
00:17:40,025 --> 00:17:43,510
and my family had a really
hard time accepting that.

283
00:17:43,612 --> 00:17:47,715
But, you know, we worked
through it, and, um...

284
00:17:49,486 --> 00:17:51,926
Bailey said that you're having
a hard time with her divorce,

285
00:17:52,005 --> 00:17:56,840
which I totally
understand, but I...

286
00:17:56,943 --> 00:18:01,361
I wanted to say that she didn't
come to that decision lightly.

287
00:18:01,463 --> 00:18:04,165
And she's a good person, and...

288
00:18:05,467 --> 00:18:07,718
Merry Christmas.

289
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:12,072
Did Hunt ever tell you about
the time that he made snow?

290
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:13,273
No.

291
00:18:13,376 --> 00:18:15,609
His guys were feeling
the holidays pretty bad,

292
00:18:15,711 --> 00:18:19,246
so Hunt orders one of those
snow makers on Christmas Eve.

293
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:23,717
He tries to get the thing going, but the
minute the snow hit the sand, it melts.

294
00:18:23,819 --> 00:18:27,021
So Hunt blindfolded his guys

295
00:18:27,122 --> 00:18:31,041
and made them put their faces
right up to the snow blower.

296
00:18:31,143 --> 00:18:34,862
There was this one
kid from Minnesota,

297
00:18:34,964 --> 00:18:39,967
he actually cried and he said it
felt exactly like Christmas at home.

298
00:18:44,807 --> 00:18:46,374
Ooh, Hunt.

299
00:18:46,475 --> 00:18:50,177
Hunt's so delicious when
he's tending to bloody soldiers.

300
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:53,047
- Love me some Hunt.
- Shut up!

301
00:18:57,353 --> 00:18:59,387
So, how was the view?

302
00:19:02,525 --> 00:19:04,258
I have been a proud father.

303
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:08,061
Your whole life, I have
been a proud father.

304
00:19:08,163 --> 00:19:12,483
Your mother and I sat in the
front row of every dance class,

305
00:19:12,585 --> 00:19:15,786
every oboe recital,
and we cheered.

306
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:18,205
We sat in the front
row of every graduation.

307
00:19:18,307 --> 00:19:22,276
I was always the first one on my
feet and the loudest one in the crowd.

308
00:19:22,394 --> 00:19:27,081
I have been a proud father.

309
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:31,819
And today, Miranda,
I sat in the gallery

310
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:35,789
and I watched you repair
some fat man's hernia,

311
00:19:35,891 --> 00:19:40,477
and for the first time in my
life I felt ashamed of you.

312
00:19:42,315 --> 00:19:45,316
This is what you
do on Christmas?

313
00:19:45,418 --> 00:19:47,984
For this you traded
your husband?

314
00:19:48,087 --> 00:19:51,289
For this you traded
your child's family?

315
00:19:51,391 --> 00:19:55,909
So you can work all day and
go home alone on Christmas

316
00:19:56,012 --> 00:19:59,596
to an empty house,
without even a tree?

317
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:05,502
I have been a proud father...

318
00:20:05,604 --> 00:20:10,674
Miranda, but I would be a bad father
today if I didn't look you in the eye

319
00:20:10,776 --> 00:20:14,761
and tell you that you have
made a terrible mistake.

320
00:20:16,231 --> 00:20:21,067
You broke your family,
you set your son up to fail.

321
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:25,222
And the child I raised...

322
00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:27,891
she was raised better than that.

323
00:20:40,473 --> 00:20:42,707
That's something you
don't see every day.

324
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:45,226
She could code, or the
monitor could short out.

325
00:20:45,328 --> 00:20:48,128
Teddy's a brilliant surgeon, but I
don't get how she made this call.

326
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:50,631
I get it. It's patient care.

327
00:20:50,733 --> 00:20:53,634
And Teddy's always been
a sucker for Christmas.

328
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:17,441
Oh, my God! Kelsey!

329
00:21:19,044 --> 00:21:23,714
From your X-rays and CT, it looks
like part of your bowel has died.

330
00:21:23,816 --> 00:21:27,368
It's a side effect of your poor
circulation, it's why you collapsed.

331
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:30,871
Just fix her, OK?

332
00:21:30,973 --> 00:21:35,192
She can't have come
this far to... Just fix her.

333
00:21:39,365 --> 00:21:41,465
We're gonna need to repair
this as soon as possible.

334
00:21:41,567 --> 00:21:43,647
The more time we wait,
the more bowel dies.

335
00:21:43,702 --> 00:21:46,520
But how? She's septic,
hypotensive, and she has no heart.

336
00:21:46,622 --> 00:21:50,207
Her pressure's too low for general
anesthesia. She won't survive.

337
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:56,864
Then... we won't put
her under general.

338
00:21:56,966 --> 00:22:00,134
This goes through the nose,
through the base of the skull,

339
00:22:00,236 --> 00:22:01,501
and then I drill the bone off.

340
00:22:01,603 --> 00:22:03,987
Well, what happens
once you drill the holes?

341
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:06,173
We put miniature staple
clips on the vessels.

342
00:22:06,275 --> 00:22:08,892
- With what instrument?
- We don't have it. Not yet.

343
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:12,629
But we will, we will. We're, uh,
still trying to figure out how to build it,

344
00:22:12,732 --> 00:22:13,947
but we're on it.

345
00:22:16,902 --> 00:22:19,936
I would like an invitation to
your home for Christmas dinner.

346
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:24,058
I know it's very late for me to
be asking for such an invitation

347
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,080
given that it is, in
fact, Christmas Day.

348
00:22:26,162 --> 00:22:28,662
However, I have a
very worried father,

349
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:33,717
and if I don't look like I have
some sort of life, he'll never leave.

350
00:22:33,819 --> 00:22:35,919
I have a bowel
infarction to repair,

351
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:38,639
and then after that I'll be
free to come to your home.

352
00:22:38,741 --> 00:22:41,308
- Sounds fine.
- Oh, absolutely.

353
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:43,960
- Thank you.
- Chief cut off funding
for equipment.

354
00:22:44,062 --> 00:22:45,582
- What?
- What?

355
00:22:45,664 --> 00:22:48,348
We're way over budget.
Nicholas is running out of time.

356
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:51,051
We want our bonuses to go
towards finishing the prototype

357
00:22:51,154 --> 00:22:54,221
- for Nicholas Jacobsen.
- Sorry, you can't do that.

358
00:22:54,323 --> 00:22:57,107
- But it'll be like a donation.
- They're our bonuses.

359
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:03,797
There are no bonuses,
that's what he's trying to say.

360
00:23:03,899 --> 00:23:06,717
There are no bonuses
this year. I'm sorry.

361
00:23:08,571 --> 00:23:09,703
Merry Christmas.

362
00:23:15,428 --> 00:23:17,695
I'll write a check. How much?

363
00:23:21,484 --> 00:23:23,801
- I'll split it with you.
- Thank you.

364
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:29,785
I have a teenager. What if
she wants to go to college?

365
00:23:29,809 --> 00:23:33,210
- Have you met her?
- Fine, I'm in.

366
00:23:33,312 --> 00:23:36,363
Thank you. I'll get back
to you with numbers. Shep.

367
00:23:36,465 --> 00:23:37,981
Chief?

368
00:23:39,619 --> 00:23:42,752
I'm sorry I tried to fire you.

369
00:23:42,854 --> 00:23:45,789
And in the spirit of the
holidays, I was, uh...

370
00:23:47,126 --> 00:23:48,675
I'm sorry.

371
00:24:28,534 --> 00:24:31,718
You're not serious. You got
him a snow globe of Seattle?

372
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:33,487
What? He likes Seattle.

373
00:24:33,589 --> 00:24:36,273
I gave you fifty bucks.
Where's my change?

374
00:24:36,375 --> 00:24:39,243
Um... Ahem. Mark?

375
00:24:39,345 --> 00:24:40,977
Your kids are bickering.

376
00:24:42,615 --> 00:24:45,582
- Have you talked to her yet?
- I'm working on it.

377
00:24:48,103 --> 00:24:51,354
Your sister's got a
ready-made family there.

378
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:54,992
Don't worry, she didn't forget
about you. She invited you, right?

379
00:24:56,863 --> 00:24:59,529
He's drinking.

380
00:25:00,266 --> 00:25:02,149
Isn't he? Richard?

381
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:04,184
He's off the wagon.

382
00:25:05,487 --> 00:25:07,587
Well, he's drinking
egg nog. It's Christmas.

383
00:25:07,689 --> 00:25:09,689
Everybody drinks
egg nog at Christmas.

384
00:25:09,791 --> 00:25:13,127
Some people do.
Recovering alcoholics don't.

385
00:25:14,313 --> 00:25:17,380
He's not an alcoholic.
That was a misdiagnosis.

386
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:21,518
Is that what he's telling you?

387
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:24,738
Meredith, he is a surgeon
and he is drinking and...

388
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,573
he is an alcoholic.

389
00:25:26,675 --> 00:25:29,509
That could quickly
become catastrophic.

390
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:34,197
Were you drinking
when I was a kid?

391
00:25:34,299 --> 00:25:39,519
When you left me with my mother and
got another family and never looked back?

392
00:25:42,174 --> 00:25:43,506
No.

393
00:25:44,777 --> 00:25:47,844
No, I didn't start
drinking until much later.

394
00:25:47,947 --> 00:25:52,116
Well then, we can't blame the
world's evils on alcohol, can we?

395
00:26:03,362 --> 00:26:05,328
Oh, yeah!

396
00:26:05,431 --> 00:26:07,514
- It hurts.
- I know.

397
00:26:07,616 --> 00:26:11,618
Surgery with only a local
anesthetic is not ideal.

398
00:26:11,721 --> 00:26:13,237
Hang in there.

399
00:26:14,473 --> 00:26:16,073
OK, you're OK.

400
00:26:16,175 --> 00:26:19,209
It's gonna be OK. I'm
here with you, all right?

401
00:26:19,311 --> 00:26:22,713
Hey, hey! No tears.

402
00:26:22,815 --> 00:26:25,132
No tears at Christmas.

403
00:26:25,234 --> 00:26:28,568
No, it's only, uh, lights...

404
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:31,538
and snowmen and...

405
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:34,858
songs. Um...

406
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:43,684
Come on, now.

407
00:26:46,488 --> 00:26:48,555
- Karev.
- No, thanks.

408
00:26:48,657 --> 00:26:51,892
- Sing, Yang.
- No, I don't... I'm Jewish.

409
00:26:51,994 --> 00:26:55,145
Don't play the race card with
me. Sing or get off my service.

410
00:27:07,643 --> 00:27:09,125
You too, Karev.

411
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:21,833
The house looks beautiful.

412
00:27:21,857 --> 00:27:24,091
- Thank you.
- Callie?

413
00:27:24,193 --> 00:27:26,126
- Working.
- That's too bad.

414
00:27:26,228 --> 00:27:29,496
- Here, you need some stuffing.
- Thanks.

415
00:27:30,632 --> 00:27:32,599
- How did Kelsey do?
- Well.

416
00:27:32,701 --> 00:27:35,269
- Who's Kelsey?
- Uh, girl with no heart.

417
00:27:35,371 --> 00:27:39,156
I have to do a
laparoscopic bowel repair

418
00:27:39,258 --> 00:27:41,791
while the poor thing
was awake on the table.

419
00:27:41,894 --> 00:27:44,311
Miranda, mind your manners.

420
00:27:44,413 --> 00:27:46,173
Even if surgery
is your whole life,

421
00:27:46,198 --> 00:27:49,383
it doesn't mean you
have to talk about bowels

422
00:27:49,485 --> 00:27:51,151
at the dinner table.

423
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:04,097
My child is healthy.

424
00:28:06,335 --> 00:28:10,737
- Excuse me?
- He may not be with me tonight,

425
00:28:10,839 --> 00:28:13,759
- but he's healthy
and he's well-loved.
- I didn't say he...

426
00:28:13,809 --> 00:28:16,393
He's a well-loved boy
and he's a happy boy

427
00:28:16,479 --> 00:28:22,265
- and staying in an unhappy marriage...
- Now is not the time or place...

428
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:24,851
a marriage that I've outgrown,

429
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:30,790
a marriage full of ultimatums
and numbness and resentment.

430
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:33,543
- Miranda!
- That is not the kind of life

431
00:28:33,645 --> 00:28:35,745
I want to model for my child!

432
00:28:35,847 --> 00:28:42,152
That is not what I want him
to believe married love is.

433
00:28:43,322 --> 00:28:45,355
Look, I know what's possible,

434
00:28:45,457 --> 00:28:48,959
I know what's out there for
me because you taught me well.

435
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:53,663
You and Mom showed
me what true love looks like.

436
00:28:53,765 --> 00:28:57,700
So I chose not to settle
and I'm happier for it,

437
00:28:57,803 --> 00:29:00,103
even if I'm alone at Christmas.

438
00:29:00,205 --> 00:29:04,141
My child is healthy
and I'm happy.

439
00:29:24,163 --> 00:29:26,913
You know, part
of my happiness is

440
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:30,283
the fact that I got to
repair a woman's bowel

441
00:29:30,385 --> 00:29:32,486
and save her life today.

442
00:29:32,588 --> 00:29:34,321
And that's God's work,

443
00:29:34,423 --> 00:29:39,292
which makes this appropriate
Christmas dinner conversation.

444
00:29:49,572 --> 00:29:52,772
I'm happy, and
my child is healthy,

445
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:55,442
and that's enough for me today.

446
00:29:55,544 --> 00:29:58,244
Dad, that's enough.

447
00:30:09,208 --> 00:30:11,658
- Uh, green beans, anyone?
- Thank you.

448
00:30:14,095 --> 00:30:15,228
Thanks.

449
00:30:27,893 --> 00:30:31,411
OK, here I would
advise a one-hand tie.

450
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:41,788
- OK, why don't I talk
and you operate?
- Good.

451
00:30:43,409 --> 00:30:45,024
Last night was my last drink.

452
00:30:45,126 --> 00:30:48,512
- The shaking will stop soon.
- Good. Good for you.

453
00:30:48,614 --> 00:30:53,216
That doesn't mean I have to quit
drinking tequila. I really like tequila.

454
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,723
- It's New Year's Eve.
- I know.

455
00:31:00,825 --> 00:31:04,277
She shows no signs of leaving,
no suitcase packed, nothing.

456
00:31:04,379 --> 00:31:07,130
Talk to her right now
or no more sex for you.

457
00:31:13,489 --> 00:31:17,273
So, what you reading?

458
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:24,831
I can tell you
don't really like me,

459
00:31:24,933 --> 00:31:27,751
and, uh, your girlfriend's,
like, totally freaked out by me

460
00:31:27,853 --> 00:31:29,953
'cause I'm kind of,
like, hotter than her.

461
00:31:30,038 --> 00:31:33,590
But... I'm pregnant. Yeah.

462
00:31:33,692 --> 00:31:36,126
I'm having a baby and, um...

463
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:40,580
That's why I dropped out of school
and why my mom kicked me out.

464
00:31:40,682 --> 00:31:45,519
Look, I know you
don't owe me anything...

465
00:31:45,621 --> 00:31:48,004
but I can tell you guys
are about to kick me out,

466
00:31:48,106 --> 00:31:50,273
and I... I...

467
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:52,859
I don't have
anywhere else to go.

468
00:31:52,961 --> 00:31:54,761
Shh! Shh, shh...

469
00:31:56,932 --> 00:32:01,167
It's OK. You're gonna be OK.

470
00:32:07,493 --> 00:32:10,160
OK, he's in hypovolemic
shock. He's lost too much blood.

471
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:12,857
We're gonna have to put a tube
down his throat to help him breathe.

472
00:32:12,881 --> 00:32:14,731
- Nicholas?
- We need to tube him right now.

473
00:32:14,833 --> 00:32:17,116
Don't tube him. Bag him
until we get to the OR.

474
00:32:17,218 --> 00:32:19,035
- The OR?
- We finished the instruments.

475
00:32:19,137 --> 00:32:20,531
- We did?
- We're gonna operate.

476
00:32:20,555 --> 00:32:22,475
I just need you to
sign the consent form.

477
00:32:22,541 --> 00:32:26,193
- Pretty dramatic timing,
Dr. Shepherd.
- I like to make an entrance.

478
00:32:27,262 --> 00:32:28,745
It's OK.

479
00:32:28,847 --> 00:32:31,748
Her kidneys are shutting down.

480
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:35,985
We need to find a donor. We
needed to find one yesterday.

481
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:41,374
It's New Year's Eve, Dr. Yang.

482
00:32:41,476 --> 00:32:43,527
You said I just had to
make it to New Year's Eve.

483
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:49,248
Drunks all over
the road, so, yeah.

484
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:51,468
Tonight's our best shot.

485
00:33:02,414 --> 00:33:05,254
- How's it handling?
- It could bend
a little more gently.

486
00:33:05,283 --> 00:33:07,901
Don't be all critical. The
thing cost me a fortune.

487
00:33:09,505 --> 00:33:11,225
At least one more
day to practice.

488
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:16,059
OK. Inserting the clip applier.

489
00:33:18,397 --> 00:33:21,915
Why don't you try torquing it a
little bit, give it a different angle?

490
00:33:25,237 --> 00:33:26,803
There you go.

491
00:33:26,905 --> 00:33:29,106
OK. There it is.

492
00:33:29,208 --> 00:33:31,324
- They're open.
- OK.

493
00:33:45,741 --> 00:33:49,309
Got it. That's the last clip.

494
00:33:49,411 --> 00:33:52,323
- Oh, my God.
- Ladies and gentlemen, we're done here.

495
00:33:52,347 --> 00:33:54,675
- Nice work. Beautiful.
- Oh, my God,
you did it.

496
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:56,199
Amazing.

497
00:33:57,102 --> 00:33:59,269
Hang on. Look at the clock.

498
00:33:59,371 --> 00:34:01,705
That's seven, six...

499
00:34:01,807 --> 00:34:03,690
Five... four...

500
00:34:03,808 --> 00:34:06,242
Three... two... one...

501
00:34:06,344 --> 00:34:08,511
Happy New Year!

502
00:34:08,613 --> 00:34:10,513
- Happy New Year!
- Happy New Year!

503
00:34:10,615 --> 00:34:11,797
Happy New Year.

504
00:34:11,899 --> 00:34:13,149
Happy New Year.

505
00:34:18,674 --> 00:34:20,974
I'm just gonna take a listen.

506
00:34:43,916 --> 00:34:46,382
- We're hitting the final wave.
- I need to talk to you.

507
00:34:46,485 --> 00:34:48,068
- I'm heading into the...
- Now.

508
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:49,570
- What is wrong with you?
- You.

509
00:34:49,687 --> 00:34:52,038
- Me?
- Yeah, you come over here...

510
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:53,952
- Why did you tell me this now?
- Why do you even care?

511
00:34:53,976 --> 00:34:57,310
You didn't say a thing all those
times, all those years, so why now?

512
00:34:57,412 --> 00:34:59,073
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

513
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:02,031
What does it matter to you? You
never felt the same way for me.

514
00:35:02,134 --> 00:35:04,167
Of course I did!

515
00:35:06,388 --> 00:35:10,373
Of course I did. I had all those
feelings for you, Teddy, for years,

516
00:35:10,475 --> 00:35:14,577
- but you never
gave me anything.
- You were engaged...

517
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:17,141
- You were engaged...
- You never gave me
one damn hint!

518
00:35:17,165 --> 00:35:19,733
You idiot.

519
00:35:19,835 --> 00:35:23,553
I have loved you forever.

520
00:35:23,655 --> 00:35:26,038
I have loved you
when I was coupled up,

521
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:28,258
I have loved you
when I was single.

522
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:31,894
I have loved you every
second of every day.

523
00:35:31,997 --> 00:35:36,432
- Teddy...
- I love you. I'm in love with you.

524
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:43,372
I'm in love with Cristina.

525
00:35:59,524 --> 00:36:01,307
You paged me?

526
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:03,843
I just confirmed a brain
death on an 18-year-old female

527
00:36:03,946 --> 00:36:07,730
involved in a head-on MVC earlier
this evening. She's a match for Kelsey.

528
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:11,234
So I called UNOS, and they gave me
the go-ahead for a directed donation.

529
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:15,338
Dr. Bailey will do the organ
recovery and I set up OR 2 for Kelsey.

530
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,607
That is why New Year's
Eve is my favorite holiday.

531
00:36:17,709 --> 00:36:21,277
Stop it! This is not a
celebration. Come here.

532
00:36:22,948 --> 00:36:25,915
No! No, no, no, not my baby.

533
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:28,567
Please, not my daughter.

534
00:36:29,504 --> 00:36:31,537
This is not a celebration.

535
00:36:34,776 --> 00:36:37,343
No! No!

536
00:36:43,502 --> 00:36:47,170
Your kidneys have stabilized
and your vitals are stable,

537
00:36:47,272 --> 00:36:49,823
and everything looks great.

538
00:36:51,743 --> 00:36:53,075
Feel.

539
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:58,948
- Awesome, huh?
- I can only feel your boob.

540
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,650
Hey!

541
00:37:00,752 --> 00:37:03,736
- You want to feel?
- Uh, no, but I will listen.

542
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:11,055
- Oh, my God! What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

543
00:37:11,079 --> 00:37:13,245
I know it's only been
a couple of months...

544
00:37:13,347 --> 00:37:16,348
And four dates. It's
technically been four dates.

545
00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:18,284
You amaze me every day.

546
00:37:18,386 --> 00:37:21,437
And we went through a war
together, we went through this together,

547
00:37:21,539 --> 00:37:23,389
and we came out the other side.

548
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:26,976
And I think if we
can get through this,

549
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:28,678
we can get through anything.

550
00:37:29,798 --> 00:37:31,698
So marry me.

551
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,199
Please.

552
00:37:33,935 --> 00:37:35,751
Yes, of course!

553
00:38:02,013 --> 00:38:03,580
I'm...

554
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:09,085
insensitive sometimes. Um...

555
00:38:10,555 --> 00:38:12,221
But I'm not oblivious,

556
00:38:12,324 --> 00:38:17,193
and I don't want you to be with me
because you feel like you owe me

557
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:20,062
because you two
went through war...

558
00:38:27,105 --> 00:38:30,873
I want you. I want you
because I want to be.

559
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:34,411
I want you because I love you.

560
00:38:36,448 --> 00:38:38,014
Are you sure?

561
00:38:47,175 --> 00:38:51,143
<i>Every day we get
to give the gift of life.</i>

562
00:38:51,245 --> 00:38:54,680
<i>It can be painful,
it can be terrifying.</i>

563
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:58,684
<i>But in the end, it's worth it.</i>

564
00:39:00,455 --> 00:39:02,889
<i>Every time.</i>

565
00:39:02,991 --> 00:39:06,693
<i>We all have the
opportunity to give.</i>

566
00:39:06,795 --> 00:39:10,830
<i>Maybe the gifts aren't as dramatic as
what happens in the operating room.</i>

567
00:39:12,233 --> 00:39:17,804
- So how was New Year's Eve
at Tucker's?
- It was fine.

568
00:39:17,906 --> 00:39:22,441
I kissed my grandson at midnight
East Coast time and tucked him into bed.

569
00:39:22,543 --> 00:39:25,645
OK. Uh, so you're
headed home today?

570
00:39:25,747 --> 00:39:28,464
- Mom's picking you up
at the airport?
- Yeah.

571
00:39:29,751 --> 00:39:31,031
I, uh...

572
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,398
tucked you in every
night of your childhood.

573
00:39:34,422 --> 00:39:36,655
- Dad...
- I tucked you in,

574
00:39:36,757 --> 00:39:38,057
and I kissed you good night

575
00:39:38,159 --> 00:39:42,979
and I checked under
the bed for bad guys.

576
00:39:43,081 --> 00:39:47,366
And you went and grew up
and got yourself a divorce...

577
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:50,152
and didn't bother to tell me.

578
00:39:53,508 --> 00:39:56,810
Dad, I didn't know
how to... explain.

579
00:39:56,912 --> 00:40:01,747
I didn't want to disappoint
you. I didn't want to be judged.

580
00:40:01,850 --> 00:40:03,616
I'm your father.

581
00:40:03,735 --> 00:40:09,122
Can you imagine if Little Tuck grew
up and got a divorce and didn't tell you?

582
00:40:16,798 --> 00:40:20,767
Then I'm sorry, Dad.
I'm... I'm so sorry.

583
00:40:20,869 --> 00:40:24,003
<i>Maybe the gift is to try
and make a simple apology.</i>

584
00:40:24,105 --> 00:40:28,091
I'm never judging you.

585
00:40:28,193 --> 00:40:31,795
I'm worrying about you. Your
mother and I worry about you.

586
00:40:31,897 --> 00:40:33,596
That's all.

587
00:40:40,888 --> 00:40:44,056
Little Tuck, he's a
real spitfire, isn't he?

588
00:40:44,158 --> 00:40:46,326
- He is.
- He sure is.

589
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:52,198
He doesn't seem too
much worse for wear.

590
00:40:55,437 --> 00:40:58,871
<i>Maybe it's to understand
another person's point of view.</i>

591
00:41:04,913 --> 00:41:07,713
Hey. I'm sorry that I paged you.

592
00:41:07,815 --> 00:41:09,048
He's pretty public here,

593
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:11,367
and I know what that
can do to his career.

594
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:13,652
I didn't know what else to do.

595
00:41:17,208 --> 00:41:19,843
<i>Maybe it's to hold
a secret for a friend.</i>

596
00:41:25,666 --> 00:41:29,101
<i>The joy supposedly
is in the giving.</i>

597
00:41:29,203 --> 00:41:30,452
Meredith!

598
00:41:31,456 --> 00:41:33,573
Happy New Year.

599
00:41:34,542 --> 00:41:37,126
She's my star pupil, Joe.

600
00:41:37,228 --> 00:41:40,963
She's my little star.
And I'm so proud of her.

601
00:41:41,065 --> 00:41:44,917
I am so very proud.

602
00:41:46,254 --> 00:41:49,505
She will be a brilliant surgeon.

603
00:41:49,607 --> 00:41:50,873
Brilliant.

604
00:41:51,976 --> 00:41:53,976
Just like her mother.

605
00:41:54,078 --> 00:41:56,562
<i>So when the joy is gone...</i>

606
00:41:56,664 --> 00:41:59,549
Get Dr. Grey a
drink, Joe. Tequila!

607
00:41:59,651 --> 00:42:03,469
<i>When the giving starts to feel more
like a burden, that's when you stop.</i>

608
00:42:03,571 --> 00:42:08,791
And, um... I will have
another... club soda.

609
00:42:08,893 --> 00:42:11,477
<i>But if you're like
most people I know...</i>

610
00:42:11,579 --> 00:42:13,813
And it's on me. On me.

611
00:42:13,915 --> 00:42:16,215
<i>You give till it hurts.</i>

612
00:42:17,051 --> 00:42:19,551
<i>And then you give some more.</i>
