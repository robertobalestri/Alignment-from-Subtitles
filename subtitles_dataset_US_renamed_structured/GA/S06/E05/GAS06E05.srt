1
00:00:04,805 --> 00:00:09,941
<i>When you get sick, it starts
out with a single bacterium.</i>

2
00:00:10,044 --> 00:00:13,145
<i>One lone, nasty intruder.</i>

3
00:00:15,933 --> 00:00:18,917
<i>Pretty soon, the
intruder duplicates.</i>

4
00:00:20,537 --> 00:00:22,754
<i>Becomes two.</i>

5
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:27,426
<i>Then those two become four...</i>

6
00:00:27,511 --> 00:00:31,479
<i>and those four become eight.</i>

7
00:00:31,581 --> 00:00:35,917
<i>Then, before your body knows it,</i>

8
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:38,086
<i>it's under attack.</i>

9
00:00:38,188 --> 00:00:41,022
- You can't put that in there.
- They told us to grab a cubby.

10
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:43,174
Yeah, I know, it's just...

11
00:00:44,144 --> 00:00:45,660
We keep it empty for a reason.

12
00:00:45,762 --> 00:00:49,697
Can you take your stuff out? There's
empty ones over there you can use.

13
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:51,750
I don't think so.

14
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,388
I said take it out!

15
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:59,040
Great. I get the
crazy one next to me.

16
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:01,793
You wanna fight? 'Cause I will.

17
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:06,548
I will fight you! You're tiny. I
could take you down in seconds.

18
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:07,928
- Come on.
- Stop!

19
00:01:07,952 --> 00:01:11,336
<i>It's an invasion.</i>

20
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:16,841
<i>The question for a doctor is
once the invaders have landed,</i>

21
00:01:16,944 --> 00:01:19,460
<i>once they've taken
over your body...</i>

22
00:01:20,397 --> 00:01:22,797
They took George's cubby.

23
00:01:24,601 --> 00:01:27,402
<i>How the hell do
you get rid of them?</i>

24
00:01:38,481 --> 00:01:43,317
They're locusts. Comfortable
locusts feeding on our surgeries.

25
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:47,622
That's rude. There should be a
couple of days where they act like guests

26
00:01:47,724 --> 00:01:50,008
before they put their
feet up on the coffee table.

27
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:53,178
And what's with the orange scrubs?
Ours aren't good enough for them?

28
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,747
We ran out. They're
on back order.

29
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:58,850
Randall from the supply company
says they'll be here in a week.

30
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:01,553
That's what you learn
when you lie here all day.

31
00:02:01,655 --> 00:02:04,489
Why order new ones? We can
give these to our replacements.

32
00:02:04,575 --> 00:02:06,742
We're not gonna be
replaced by anybody.

33
00:02:06,844 --> 00:02:10,162
- If I have to become a coroner.
- No one is becoming a coroner.

34
00:02:10,264 --> 00:02:12,881
- Cristina, tell him.
- Tell him what? They're here.

35
00:02:12,983 --> 00:02:17,235
- It's over.
- Hey, we are not
some stupid hosts.

36
00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:20,806
They can't invade us. They can't
attach themselves to our faces,

37
00:02:20,908 --> 00:02:23,788
and while we're eating
spaghetti, explode out of our chests

38
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:26,728
and skitter across the
floor. This is our ship.

39
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:29,631
This is our ship.

40
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:32,684
Excuse me, are you quoting
a Sigourney Weaver movie?

41
00:02:32,786 --> 00:02:34,186
Shut up.

42
00:02:34,288 --> 00:02:37,856
That's what happens when you
live here. You watch a lot of TV.

43
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:42,177
We own this hospital. We
were born in this hospital.

44
00:02:42,279 --> 00:02:48,116
And we will hold this hospital
with our last gasping breath.

45
00:02:48,218 --> 00:02:51,920
I really don't wanna be a
coroner. I don't like dead people.

46
00:02:52,022 --> 00:02:55,139
Go out there and go get
surgeries before they take them.

47
00:02:55,242 --> 00:02:58,927
Go! And I want a full
report by the end of the day!

48
00:03:00,047 --> 00:03:02,530
And what is wrong with you?

49
00:03:05,035 --> 00:03:09,354
- I don't know
what I'm fighting for.
- Surgeries, Cristina!

50
00:03:09,456 --> 00:03:13,425
Surgeries. There will be a
cardio god here again one day.

51
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:16,828
And when there is, you don't
want to be out of practice. Now, go!

52
00:03:20,517 --> 00:03:21,795
This the overflow
from Mercy West?

53
00:03:21,819 --> 00:03:23,818
Their ER closed
for good last night.

54
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,454
- Everyone's coming here.
- A perk from the merger.

55
00:03:26,556 --> 00:03:28,606
- Our new attending.
- First day back?

56
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,920
- Yeah.
- You picked a good one. Nice and quiet.

57
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,355
- Not a lot going on.
- Yeah.

58
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:33,656
- Thank you.
- Coming through!

59
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,247
Where do you want us?

60
00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:37,894
- At this point,
anywhere is good.
- At Mercy West, we do zones.

61
00:03:37,918 --> 00:03:40,419
When it's super busy, we
give everyone a zone, a space.

62
00:03:40,521 --> 00:03:42,887
Nurses put a person in,
you know it's your patient.

63
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:46,258
- Helps get to them quicker.
- This is an ER,
not a schoolyard.

64
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,727
- We're not playing four square.
- I like it.

65
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:50,990
- What?
- Good idea. Let's try. Your name?

66
00:03:51,014 --> 00:03:52,047
Jackson Avery.

67
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:55,550
Dr. Avery, Dr. Hunt.
It's all yours. Zone away.

68
00:03:58,455 --> 00:03:59,938
Let's go.

69
00:04:01,941 --> 00:04:04,237
- Chief?
- What do you need, Karev?

70
00:04:04,261 --> 00:04:06,511
I know you have cuts to
make at the resident level.

71
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:10,582
I just want you to keep in mind
that Izzie's not 100 percent back yet.

72
00:04:10,684 --> 00:04:13,719
I mean, she's
recovering. Look, she...

73
00:04:13,821 --> 00:04:18,740
- She just... She needs this.
- I have a hospital to run,
Karev.

74
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:21,309
I have two hospitals to run.

75
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:28,016
- Hey, that wasn't cool.
- What?

76
00:04:28,118 --> 00:04:31,619
In the locker room. My friend
should've left that cubby empty. I'm sorry.

77
00:04:31,722 --> 00:04:34,489
- She's obviously not, so...
- It's the first day of school.

78
00:04:34,591 --> 00:04:38,259
Everyone's on edge. I'll probably
kill someone before the day's through.

79
00:04:38,362 --> 00:04:41,629
I'm Charles, by the
way. Charles Percy.

80
00:04:41,732 --> 00:04:44,749
Might be kind of hard for
you not to talk to me all day.

81
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:46,501
It can be done.

82
00:04:46,603 --> 00:04:49,938
I once didn't talk to my family for a
car ride across the whole country.

83
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,708
Ten days, 15 states, not a peep.

84
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:56,210
I just read books,
pretended I was a hostage.

85
00:04:56,312 --> 00:04:59,765
- Izzie Stevens.
- Nice to meet you,
Izzie Stevens.

86
00:04:59,867 --> 00:05:03,285
Hey, do you happen to know the
key code to the research library?

87
00:05:03,387 --> 00:05:05,031
I was here last
night, it was closed.

88
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:07,488
It took me two years
to get that code.

89
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:09,758
I need every
advantage I can get.

90
00:05:14,631 --> 00:05:17,999
Did the gentleman from the
waiting room ever find you?

91
00:05:18,102 --> 00:05:19,667
- What?
- It's the gentleman

92
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:23,838
- who could possibly
be your father.
- What?

93
00:05:28,946 --> 00:05:30,511
Daddy.

94
00:05:31,648 --> 00:05:33,615
Calliope.

95
00:05:33,717 --> 00:05:36,151
What? What are you doing here?

96
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:40,722
- I came to see you.
- Why?

97
00:05:41,408 --> 00:05:43,575
Calliope, we used to talk.

98
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:46,411
Every Sunday, we used
to talk. I'd wait for your call.

99
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:50,198
And you'd tell me everything.
All about your crazy adventures.

100
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:58,373
Even when you were
in trouble, you'd still call.

101
00:05:58,475 --> 00:06:02,427
And we worked it out.
We'd always work it out.

102
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:05,096
Hmm?

103
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:06,698
Daddy.

104
00:06:08,168 --> 00:06:12,553
I'm sorry. I'm... I'm
sorry things got so...

105
00:06:12,655 --> 00:06:15,256
But the fact that you came.

106
00:06:18,212 --> 00:06:20,595
Daddy, is that Father Kevin?

107
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:23,348
Hello, Calliope.

108
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:26,317
Are you...

109
00:06:27,504 --> 00:06:29,053
two here to...?

110
00:06:31,508 --> 00:06:34,576
- You think
you can pray away the gay.
- We can just sit and talk.

111
00:06:34,678 --> 00:06:38,280
- Oh, no. You can't
pray away the gay.
- Calliope Iphegenia Torres!

112
00:06:38,381 --> 00:06:41,899
You can't pray away the gay!

113
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:53,678
The man flew 3,000 miles to
make me straight. With a priest!

114
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,447
I'm lucky they didn't march
into the ER swinging incense,

115
00:06:56,549 --> 00:06:58,599
- all hepped up for exorcism.
- Are you done?

116
00:06:58,701 --> 00:07:00,018
Am I...? No!

117
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,988
He came to disinfect you.
You don't find that abhorrent?

118
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:05,690
- I do, but...
- There's no but.

119
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:08,276
You're gonna tell me you
get where he's coming from?

120
00:07:08,378 --> 00:07:11,273
- Maybe you should
try and talk to him.
- I have nothing to say!

121
00:07:11,297 --> 00:07:13,982
If he wants to throw away
our relationship after 30 years,

122
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:16,551
- that's his decision.
- He hasn't done anything.

123
00:07:16,653 --> 00:07:18,470
You're the one who
changed the game.

124
00:07:19,873 --> 00:07:23,141
You didn't expect understanding
when you came out to your parents?

125
00:07:25,762 --> 00:07:28,529
I never had boyfriends. Ever.

126
00:07:28,631 --> 00:07:31,900
I had a poster of Cindy Crawford,
and I wasn't just looking at her mole.

127
00:07:32,002 --> 00:07:36,020
It wasn't news to my mom when I
brought somebody home named Joanne.

128
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:40,225
But you... you dated men
your whole life. You loved men.

129
00:07:40,327 --> 00:07:44,595
You even married one. Want to
talk about 30 years of a relationship?

130
00:07:44,698 --> 00:07:47,298
He's been consistent
for 30 years.

131
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,035
All of a sudden,
you're a whole new girl.

132
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:55,089
So cut him some slack. Sit
down and have a conversation.

133
00:07:55,191 --> 00:07:58,743
Give him room to
be a little shocked.

134
00:08:01,631 --> 00:08:06,050
- I hate you.
- 'Cause I'm right
and I'm awesome.

135
00:08:06,135 --> 00:08:09,587
Thanks for being my tour guide
through this first-day madness.

136
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:11,823
We both got
assigned zone five, so.

137
00:08:11,925 --> 00:08:13,791
I know, it's not like
you had any choice.

138
00:08:13,894 --> 00:08:15,827
Still, you're a peach
to pretend otherwise.

139
00:08:15,929 --> 00:08:18,429
- Being the new kid is...
- A little scary, I know.

140
00:08:18,531 --> 00:08:21,532
You were here when that psycho
intern cabal was marching around

141
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:25,904
chopping out each other's organs.
Now, that must've been scary.

142
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:30,324
- Hi! I'm Dr. Kepner. Oh, handcuffs.
- I'm not an axe murderer.

143
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:32,143
I just broke into
someone's house.

144
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:35,964
The dude came after me with a
golf club, beat the crap out of me.

145
00:08:36,066 --> 00:08:38,399
You don't need the
cop, I can barely move.

146
00:08:38,501 --> 00:08:41,702
- Roll him.
- We'll keep the cop.

147
00:08:43,824 --> 00:08:46,841
He's got multiple contusions
and ecchymosis over his back.

148
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:50,011
He's gonna need lumbar
and thoracic films. Down.

149
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:52,247
OK. By the way, it was
one organ. An appendix.

150
00:08:52,349 --> 00:08:54,232
It wasn't a psycho cabal.

151
00:08:54,334 --> 00:08:57,318
Oh! Good to know.

152
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:02,440
- Hey, Sarah.
- Dr. Stevens.

153
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,658
I have to go. The
doctors are here.

154
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:09,797
My sister and her daughters want you
all to promise them it's a good kidney.

155
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:12,867
- It's a good kidney!
- There. All right?

156
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:14,969
Bye.

157
00:09:15,071 --> 00:09:18,706
Uh, Sarah Fremont, age
27. End-stage renal disease,

158
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:21,559
on dialysis for three
years waiting for a kidney.

159
00:09:21,661 --> 00:09:24,012
- Down to her last access site.
- Polite way of saying

160
00:09:24,114 --> 00:09:26,108
they've run out of
places to stick needles.

161
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:29,517
Ms. Fremont has a
subclavian catheter for access.

162
00:09:29,619 --> 00:09:33,187
- Why is this not ideal?
- It's difficult to obtain

163
00:09:33,289 --> 00:09:35,957
sufficient blood flow through...

164
00:09:36,059 --> 00:09:38,877
Oh... You guys raise hands.

165
00:09:40,447 --> 00:09:43,581
Frank Nusbaum, 42, multiple
mostly superficial stab wounds,

166
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:46,100
vital signs stable. His
buddy's got a lacerated palm.

167
00:09:46,202 --> 00:09:47,597
- Got it.
- I'm not his buddy!

168
00:09:47,621 --> 00:09:49,554
He touched my
little girl! My baby!

169
00:09:49,656 --> 00:09:54,158
She's not a baby, she's 19 years
old! Ain't a scrap of baby left, Don!

170
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:56,427
One, two, three.

171
00:09:57,848 --> 00:09:59,213
OK, we got a bleeder here!

172
00:09:59,315 --> 00:10:01,883
Draw up some lidocaine and
get me a lac tray with 3-0 silk.

173
00:10:01,985 --> 00:10:04,318
- Need any help?
- This is gonna pinch.

174
00:10:04,421 --> 00:10:06,537
He came at me with a
knife! Tried to cut off...

175
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:10,208
Come on, I was gesturing!
You ran into the knife!

176
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:13,895
You're an idiot and a pervert!
She used to baby-sit your brats.

177
00:10:13,997 --> 00:10:16,758
- Can't believe
I let her in your house!
- I love her, Don.

178
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:19,000
- I love her and she loves me.
- I'm gonna kill him!

179
00:10:19,102 --> 00:10:22,937
- Easy! All right?
- Let him die! It's what he deserves!

180
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,801
- Shut him up!
- There's nothing...?

181
00:10:24,825 --> 00:10:28,442
There. That's how we
do it on our side of town.

182
00:10:30,013 --> 00:10:32,480
Nice try. This is my
zone. He's my patient.

183
00:10:32,582 --> 00:10:36,434
Yet I'm the one actually helping him.
How long have you had stomach pains?

184
00:10:36,536 --> 00:10:39,220
A few days now. They
keep getting worse.

185
00:10:39,322 --> 00:10:42,707
My dad fell a couple of months
ago. Had a stable hip fracture.

186
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:45,626
- This is my patient.
- Not anymore.

187
00:10:45,729 --> 00:10:48,179
Fine. Good luck doing
an H&P without a chart.

188
00:10:48,281 --> 00:10:51,282
- I'll just add this
to the chart later.
- If you can find it.

189
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:55,069
This is the nurses' lounge. It is
literally always someone's birthday.

190
00:10:55,171 --> 00:10:57,571
If you're nice to the
nurses, you will get cake.

191
00:10:57,673 --> 00:11:01,376
- The lab.
- How's the IL-2 going,
Dr. S? Good?

192
00:11:01,478 --> 00:11:05,830
- Good.
- IL-2, huh?

193
00:11:05,932 --> 00:11:08,149
- Are you feeling...?
- Stable for now.

194
00:11:09,302 --> 00:11:10,880
And you don't want
anyone to know

195
00:11:10,904 --> 00:11:14,005
because they'll be
blown away by the fact

196
00:11:14,107 --> 00:11:16,674
that you're back at work and
only be able to think of you

197
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:18,856
as some sort of
awesome superwoman.

198
00:11:18,895 --> 00:11:21,462
- Which, clearly, you are.
- You know what?

199
00:11:21,564 --> 00:11:24,065
The fake flattery?
It's kind of gross.

200
00:11:25,318 --> 00:11:28,452
You wanna know something
deeply personal about me?

201
00:11:30,891 --> 00:11:33,408
See that girl? Her name's Reed.

202
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:37,628
I have the biggest crush in the world on
her and she doesn't even know I'm alive.

203
00:11:37,731 --> 00:11:40,898
She calls me Charlie.

204
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,200
Nobody named
Charlie ever got the girl.

205
00:11:43,302 --> 00:11:47,421
Charlie Brown, Charlie Manson.

206
00:11:47,524 --> 00:11:51,925
I'm not trying to minimize your
cancer, but this really sucks for me.

207
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:55,930
- You like her?
- I love her.

208
00:11:59,502 --> 00:12:02,187
- 4381.
- What's that?

209
00:12:02,289 --> 00:12:04,822
The code to the
research library.

210
00:12:07,527 --> 00:12:09,407
"While performance
has been evaluated,

211
00:12:09,496 --> 00:12:12,763
the largest considerations
have been budgetary."

212
00:12:12,865 --> 00:12:15,716
This is the speech we want
you to use when you're firing staff.

213
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:18,103
These exact
words. Don't deviate.

214
00:12:18,188 --> 00:12:20,337
I'm not using your
speech to fire people.

215
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:25,109
And I don't need an HR
chaperone. Thank you for your time.

216
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:28,196
Chief, are you familiar
with Megan Nowlan?

217
00:12:28,298 --> 00:12:30,681
Yes. She was an intern.

218
00:12:30,783 --> 00:12:33,985
Married to Steve Mostow.

219
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:36,754
I fired her. I know
how to fire people.

220
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:39,256
I don't like it, but I know
how to do it. And I do it well.

221
00:12:39,325 --> 00:12:41,425
You used an e-mail to fire her.

222
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:44,162
And now she's suing the
hospital for wrongful termination.

223
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:47,065
Claims she was fired
because she was pregnant.

224
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:54,138
So... this is the
speech. Don't deviate.

225
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,191
T&L spine films show
a burst fracture at T12.

226
00:12:57,293 --> 00:13:00,261
You see evidence of instability
because vertebral height loss

227
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:04,398
is greater than 50 percent, which
implies both ALL and PLL are disrupted.

228
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,418
What's that mean?
I got a broken back?

229
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,553
I'll still be able
to walk, right?

230
00:13:09,656 --> 00:13:11,673
You will still be able to walk,

231
00:13:11,775 --> 00:13:13,207
burgle, have a full life.

232
00:13:13,309 --> 00:13:15,493
- Ideas?
- Decompression via corpectomy

233
00:13:15,595 --> 00:13:18,580
and reconstruction with
strut graft and instrumentation.

234
00:13:18,682 --> 00:13:20,114
Wow! I might be
out of my league.

235
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:21,866
She has a photographic memory.

236
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:24,313
- We're all out of that league.
- I was thinking you could do

237
00:13:24,337 --> 00:13:27,688
transpedicle screws
with a posterior approach.

238
00:13:28,424 --> 00:13:30,458
Hmm...

239
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,962
It seemed like a good idea,
but, you know, maybe not.

240
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:37,081
Let's go with the
pedicle screws.

241
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:40,301
OK. Get him in pre-op. Let me
know when his test results come back.

242
00:13:40,403 --> 00:13:41,835
I'm on it.

243
00:13:45,841 --> 00:13:48,109
Frank! Oh, my God!

244
00:13:48,211 --> 00:13:51,195
- Honey, are you OK?
- I'll be fine, sweetheart.

245
00:13:51,281 --> 00:13:53,948
- Get off of her, you perv!
- Daddy!

246
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:56,734
- I will kill you,
you son of a bitch!
- Security!

247
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:04,737
- Nice work!
- Thanks.

248
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:06,060
I got it from here.

249
00:14:19,425 --> 00:14:21,675
A tackle like that, you
had to play football.

250
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:23,444
- I played a little in college.
- Safety?

251
00:14:23,546 --> 00:14:28,199
- And wide receiver, yeah.
- Offense and defense. Impressive.

252
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:32,119
Can you bring
that guy over later?

253
00:14:32,221 --> 00:14:33,855
I want to thank him.

254
00:14:34,824 --> 00:14:36,157
He saved my life.

255
00:14:37,493 --> 00:14:40,911
No, I saved your
life. I'm still saving it.

256
00:14:42,481 --> 00:14:44,548
- You paged?
- Yes, I ran a CT on your guy

257
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:47,218
with the tummy ache. Turns
out he has an adrenal mass.

258
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,601
Thought you might
want to see the scans.

259
00:14:49,689 --> 00:14:52,106
I was waiting till I got
lab results to order a CT.

260
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:54,025
Hmm-hmm.

261
00:14:54,127 --> 00:14:56,427
- You stole my lab results?
- And look,

262
00:14:56,529 --> 00:14:58,306
I get a surgery
for all my trouble.

263
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:03,217
Excuse me, Dr. Karev? My dad and I
have some more questions. He's still upset.

264
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:06,186
I'll be there in a
minute. Thanks.

265
00:15:08,124 --> 00:15:10,023
I'll take those.

266
00:15:17,933 --> 00:15:20,818
You gonna fight back at some
point, or just let her bury you?

267
00:15:20,903 --> 00:15:24,004
She's not burying me. She's new.

268
00:15:24,106 --> 00:15:26,774
She's just finding her footing.

269
00:15:26,876 --> 00:15:29,243
She found her footing
on the back of your neck.

270
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:33,764
- Why do you care?
- I don't know. I like you.

271
00:15:35,068 --> 00:15:37,301
No, I like that.

272
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:38,469
Stop.

273
00:15:38,571 --> 00:15:42,039
Find her open window.
Everyone has one.

274
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:45,059
A weak spot. Undefended.

275
00:15:45,161 --> 00:15:48,563
An open window or a
key hidden in a fake rock.

276
00:15:48,665 --> 00:15:52,049
- That's how I do it.
- Yeah, you're a criminal
and I'm not.

277
00:15:52,134 --> 00:15:55,886
It's not a crime to do to
her what she's doing to you.

278
00:15:55,989 --> 00:16:00,157
- Which is what, exactly?
- Making you look like an idiot.

279
00:16:02,478 --> 00:16:03,877
Hey.

280
00:16:03,979 --> 00:16:06,025
- Have you talked
to any of them?
- Who?

281
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:08,583
- The Mercy Westers.
- Yeah.

282
00:16:08,685 --> 00:16:11,885
- And?
- And I love you.

283
00:16:11,987 --> 00:16:14,387
Not that. I need to know
what's going on out there.

284
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:17,875
How's Cristina doing? She was
cardio-deprived and depressed.

285
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:20,861
Are you and Cristina in
a dark and twisty place?

286
00:16:20,964 --> 00:16:24,281
- Are you having
the dark and twisties?
- We are.

287
00:16:24,384 --> 00:16:26,962
- Both of you are dark
and twisty.
- I told you we are.

288
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,919
OK.

289
00:16:29,022 --> 00:16:31,705
Uh, excuse me,
Dr. Hunt, you paged me?

290
00:16:31,808 --> 00:16:34,826
Your patient was having neurologic
symptoms, you didn't notice?

291
00:16:34,928 --> 00:16:37,022
- Well, I...
- Lucky for you,
Dr. Adamson did,

292
00:16:37,046 --> 00:16:41,098
and correctly diagnosed carotid
stenosis. Book an OR for the afternoon.

293
00:16:41,201 --> 00:16:43,700
What about the surgery
for his adrenal tumor?

294
00:16:43,802 --> 00:16:46,954
Your dad has a 90 percent
blockage in his right carotid artery.

295
00:16:47,056 --> 00:16:49,890
We need to operate
first. That's a lot to digest.

296
00:16:49,992 --> 00:16:52,893
But Dr. Adamson here
will keep you informed.

297
00:16:54,914 --> 00:16:58,349
With all due respect, Dr. Hunt,
Mr. Goldman's my patient.

298
00:16:58,451 --> 00:17:00,584
- I found the tumor.
- When I operate on the tumor,

299
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:03,404
you can scrub in. In the
meantime, help Dr. Adamson

300
00:17:03,506 --> 00:17:05,806
- prep the patient for the CEA.
- Sir...

301
00:17:05,908 --> 00:17:08,476
Whatever she needs, Karev.

302
00:17:10,113 --> 00:17:13,547
Neurologic symptoms? You
didn't put that in the chart.

303
00:17:13,649 --> 00:17:15,883
Oh, I didn't? Hmm...

304
00:17:19,438 --> 00:17:21,722
All right, fine. I get it.

305
00:17:21,824 --> 00:17:24,492
I sprang this on you.
It's a lot to take in.

306
00:17:24,594 --> 00:17:30,465
And... you feel like you don't have
much experience with gay people.

307
00:17:30,567 --> 00:17:33,266
Uncle Berto hasn't been
single for 60 years for no reason.

308
00:17:33,369 --> 00:17:35,636
- Calliope...
- It's still an adjustment.

309
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:41,575
That said, you should've
adjusted by now.

310
00:17:41,677 --> 00:17:44,378
You're supposed to
love me, no matter what.

311
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,298
That's... what a parent does.

312
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,417
I love you with all my heart.

313
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:53,187
But with all that's
going on with you now...

314
00:17:53,289 --> 00:17:56,457
Look, I'm scared for
you. It's an abomination.

315
00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:00,311
- It's an eternity in hell.
- Let's not start with words
like hell.

316
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:03,397
That's why you flew 3,000 miles?
To tell me I was going to hell?

317
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:07,768
- I thought you came here
to apologize.
- I can't apologize, Calliope!

318
00:18:07,871 --> 00:18:10,454
I don't understand what
happened or where I went wrong!

319
00:18:10,556 --> 00:18:14,225
- Where you went wrong?
- OK. Leviticus:

320
00:18:14,327 --> 00:18:17,011
"Thou shalt not lie with a
man as one lies with a female.

321
00:18:17,112 --> 00:18:19,613
- It is an abomination."
- Don't quote the Bible at me.

322
00:18:19,715 --> 00:18:23,283
"The outcry of Sodom and Gomorrah
is great and their sin is grave."

323
00:18:23,385 --> 00:18:26,270
- This is not what we...
- Jesus: "A new commandment
that I give

324
00:18:26,372 --> 00:18:29,740
- unto you that
you love one another."
- Romans: "The law is..."

325
00:18:29,843 --> 00:18:32,242
Jesus: "He who is without
sin cast the first stone."

326
00:18:32,344 --> 00:18:34,795
- So you admit it's a sin.
- "Blessed are the merciful,

327
00:18:34,898 --> 00:18:38,349
for they shall obtain mercy."
Jesus: "Blessed are the pure in heart,

328
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:40,129
for they shall see God." Jesus:

329
00:18:40,153 --> 00:18:43,254
"Blessed are those who have been
persecuted for righteousness' sake

330
00:18:43,356 --> 00:18:47,124
for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven."
Jesus is my savior, Daddy, not you!

331
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:49,577
And Jesus would be
ashamed of you for judging me!

332
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:52,346
He would be ashamed of you
for turning your back on me!

333
00:18:52,448 --> 00:18:54,281
He would be ashamed!

334
00:19:09,015 --> 00:19:11,915
With this kind of injury, there
is a chance you could end up

335
00:19:12,018 --> 00:19:15,653
- with severe weakness
in your legs.
- That's OK.

336
00:19:15,755 --> 00:19:18,405
I carry the stuff out with
my arms, not my legs.

337
00:19:18,507 --> 00:19:21,892
- This is serious, Billy.
- You're gonna fix me up fine.

338
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:26,797
Listen, I've got
a present for you.

339
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:29,233
- You stole her notebook?
- Keep it down.

340
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:31,636
You want my cop all
over this? Don't you get it?

341
00:19:31,738 --> 00:19:36,674
- This is her open window.
- I don't want her open window.

342
00:19:36,776 --> 00:19:40,294
"You're not just a good
doctor, you're a great doctor.

343
00:19:40,396 --> 00:19:44,381
You are the future of medicine.

344
00:19:45,568 --> 00:19:48,736
Only you can keep you down."

345
00:19:50,205 --> 00:19:54,441
And my favorite: "No one
can tell it's plastic surgery."

346
00:19:54,543 --> 00:19:56,143
Oh, my God.

347
00:19:56,245 --> 00:19:59,274
I think it's the nose, but it could
be the boobs. What do you think?

348
00:19:59,298 --> 00:20:03,034
- Give it back to her! Stop reading!
- Future of medicine alert!

349
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:06,087
You haven't seen my
notebook anywhere, have you?

350
00:20:06,189 --> 00:20:08,438
Small, red. I was
holding it all morning.

351
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:13,060
- I'm not sure.
- So much for
that photographic memory.

352
00:20:14,447 --> 00:20:16,347
Good luck finding it.

353
00:20:18,284 --> 00:20:19,524
This blows.

354
00:20:20,669 --> 00:20:22,637
- Getting your ass kicked?
- Shut up.

355
00:20:22,739 --> 00:20:25,556
I hear yours got a
standing ovation in the ER.

356
00:20:25,658 --> 00:20:28,492
The one who saved the whole
ER from the maniac with a hammer?

357
00:20:28,577 --> 00:20:30,043
OK. He didn't save anyone.

358
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:32,546
He did some stupid ninja
leap and tripped a guy.

359
00:20:32,649 --> 00:20:36,000
I used actual medicine to
stop a person from dying.

360
00:20:36,102 --> 00:20:38,753
Mine has a notebook
that she takes notes in,

361
00:20:38,855 --> 00:20:41,906
notes of a very personal
nature, and I stole it.

362
00:20:42,008 --> 00:20:43,452
- You what?
- Give it.

363
00:20:43,476 --> 00:20:47,027
No! No, I am not
sinking to their level.

364
00:20:47,129 --> 00:20:49,429
They are vindictive
and they are aggressive

365
00:20:49,531 --> 00:20:52,450
and they're not team players,
and if we are not careful,

366
00:20:52,552 --> 00:20:55,286
that spirit is going
to infect our hospital.

367
00:20:55,388 --> 00:20:58,283
- We have to fight it.
- Which is why you
stole her notebook?

368
00:20:58,307 --> 00:21:01,258
- And read it.
- She's not a very nice person.

369
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,261
- Hey.
- Score! You rock.

370
00:21:04,363 --> 00:21:06,347
- No. That's not for you.
- Who's it for?

371
00:21:06,449 --> 00:21:09,166
- Charles.
- Your Mercy West guy?

372
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:12,853
They're handing us our asses on a
plate and you're serving him coffee?

373
00:21:12,955 --> 00:21:15,689
Charles is kind of awesome,
and if you could get past

374
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:17,892
your egos, you'd
realize you can't write off

375
00:21:17,994 --> 00:21:21,812
all the Mercy West residents
just 'cause you feel threatened.

376
00:21:21,898 --> 00:21:25,066
- We don't feel threatened.
- No.

377
00:21:26,218 --> 00:21:28,318
We feel pretty threatened.

378
00:21:32,808 --> 00:21:37,978
- Dudes, they're not here.
- Hallelujah.

379
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,647
They're not eating.
They're working.

380
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,235
Oh, my God! They
don't eat lunch!

381
00:21:48,374 --> 00:21:51,141
- What's going on?
- Pulsatile mass over
the stab wound.

382
00:21:51,243 --> 00:21:53,761
- What are we looking at?
- Can't be sure without Angio,

383
00:21:53,863 --> 00:21:56,563
- but it's a pseudoaneurysm.
- Right. Keep pressure on.

384
00:21:56,665 --> 00:21:58,865
Get him to Angio. If it's
positive, you scrub in.

385
00:21:58,968 --> 00:22:01,251
- Thank you, sir.
- That's my patient.

386
00:22:01,353 --> 00:22:03,503
He was here and you weren't.

387
00:22:03,605 --> 00:22:08,192
- Dr. Hunt!
- What?

388
00:22:11,264 --> 00:22:14,097
- Cristina, what?
- Doesn't matter
that it's my patient

389
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:17,651
or my surgery. You're prioritizing
based on some random code,

390
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:19,970
some stupid rule you
have to not favor me.

391
00:22:20,072 --> 00:22:21,605
It's one surgery!

392
00:22:23,942 --> 00:22:25,476
Forget it.

393
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:32,010
The woman does whatever I ask.

394
00:22:32,034 --> 00:22:35,085
I want something, she gets it
for me. The research library?

395
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:38,222
Anytime you wanna go in,
it's closed, just say the word.

396
00:22:38,324 --> 00:22:40,558
- She gave me the code.
- You're kidding.

397
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:45,796
She can't do enough for me. It's
like I have my own surgical bitch.

398
00:23:12,041 --> 00:23:14,375
It didn't go well, huh?

399
00:23:17,346 --> 00:23:19,913
At least now I can
move on with my life.

400
00:23:20,016 --> 00:23:24,118
Stop entertaining any thoughts of
getting back together with my family.

401
00:23:26,322 --> 00:23:28,288
I don't need a father.

402
00:23:29,258 --> 00:23:31,492
I don't.

403
00:23:31,593 --> 00:23:34,044
Not one who won't accept me.

404
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:50,961
His vital signs are
fine. BP looks good.

405
00:23:51,063 --> 00:23:54,798
I hurt... The neck...

406
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,367
- Blood...
- What?

407
00:23:57,469 --> 00:24:02,039
In... head... place... 12.

408
00:24:02,141 --> 00:24:04,775
- What's happening here?
- I'm not sure.

409
00:24:04,877 --> 00:24:08,878
We're gonna have
to hold off on the OR.

410
00:24:08,981 --> 00:24:12,099
- Pathetic.
- He just said a bunch
of weird crap.

411
00:24:12,201 --> 00:24:14,468
He has expressive
aphasia, means Broca's area.

412
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:17,604
The left side of the brain. You
said the right side was blocked.

413
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:20,185
- Five percent have Broca's on right.
- - Wanna take that chance?

414
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:21,586
What if it's brain
met from the tumor?

415
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:24,078
Because you diagnosed
the tumor, it's a met.

416
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:26,897
- I've seen this before! Have you?
- Enough!

417
00:24:28,784 --> 00:24:31,652
Your behavior has
been disgusting.

418
00:24:31,754 --> 00:24:35,255
All you've done all day is take pleasure
in how the other one got it wrong,

419
00:24:35,357 --> 00:24:36,991
how they screwed it up.

420
00:24:37,093 --> 00:24:39,126
This is my father.

421
00:24:39,228 --> 00:24:41,595
My father!

422
00:24:42,848 --> 00:24:46,599
And you are
supposed to be healers.

423
00:24:46,701 --> 00:24:48,969
That's what your
job is supposed to be.

424
00:24:49,071 --> 00:24:50,654
To heal people.

425
00:24:52,875 --> 00:24:54,875
We're gonna run some
more tests, ma'am.

426
00:24:54,977 --> 00:24:58,161
We're very sorry.

427
00:24:59,532 --> 00:25:01,532
Thank you.

428
00:25:04,352 --> 00:25:06,970
- Can I talk to you
for a minute?
- Go away.

429
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:10,240
I picked up the labs. If you want,
I can take care of the dialysis.

430
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:13,827
I've got this. I don't need
a surgical bitch, thanks.

431
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:19,466
Izzie, it wasn't personal.
That stuff, it just...

432
00:25:19,568 --> 00:25:22,652
comes with the job. I'd expect
you to do the same thing to me.

433
00:25:22,755 --> 00:25:26,907
Outside of work, you can be friends.
But inside, it's a different story.

434
00:25:27,009 --> 00:25:29,137
- It was at Mercy West.
- Isn't how it is here.

435
00:25:29,161 --> 00:25:32,546
Here, we don't just think about
ourselves. We support one another.

436
00:25:32,648 --> 00:25:34,348
We have each
other's backs. We...

437
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:38,618
We throw ourselves in front of buses
to save the lives of complete strangers!

438
00:25:40,155 --> 00:25:43,940
But you will never measure
up to the people we've lost!

439
00:25:46,561 --> 00:25:49,897
Let's do 140 base
sodium, 37 base bicarb

440
00:25:49,999 --> 00:25:54,651
and zero K bath with an
ultrafiltration of 3.5 liters.

441
00:25:57,339 --> 00:26:01,258
<i>That, I suppose, makes
everything quite all right.</i>

442
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,177
<i>This?</i>

443
00:26:07,766 --> 00:26:10,233
Cristina?

444
00:26:10,335 --> 00:26:11,668
Cristina!

445
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:14,054
- Cristina, talk to me.
- No.

446
00:26:14,156 --> 00:26:15,889
Cristina!

447
00:26:19,662 --> 00:26:20,928
What happened?

448
00:26:29,137 --> 00:26:30,871
Here.

449
00:26:34,727 --> 00:26:36,447
Talk to me. Tell
me what happened.

450
00:26:36,495 --> 00:26:39,129
Nothing.

451
00:26:39,231 --> 00:26:41,915
Nothing is happening to me!

452
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:44,484
I don't know what I'm doing.

453
00:26:44,586 --> 00:26:48,254
I'm, like, chasing after
surgeries I don't care about.

454
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:57,964
Do you know how long it's been
since I've held a heart in my hand?

455
00:26:59,168 --> 00:27:02,702
Since I felt that... that joy?

456
00:27:02,804 --> 00:27:04,871
That rush?

457
00:27:09,978 --> 00:27:11,178
I miss Burke!

458
00:27:12,681 --> 00:27:14,732
I miss him all day!

459
00:27:14,834 --> 00:27:16,216
I miss...

460
00:27:16,318 --> 00:27:20,654
It's not the relationship
or the sex. I miss...

461
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:28,278
Every day when he
was here, I held hearts.

462
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:31,015
And I got picked not
because of favoritism,

463
00:27:31,117 --> 00:27:33,467
but because it was
just... It was right!

464
00:27:34,336 --> 00:27:37,271
And I learned. I learned.

465
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:49,733
And I felt seen.

466
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:52,736
And now, you know
what? I don't know what.

467
00:27:52,838 --> 00:27:55,438
I spent this
entire day fighting.

468
00:27:59,211 --> 00:28:02,212
And I don't wanna do it anymore.

469
00:28:06,618 --> 00:28:08,752
Come over here.

470
00:28:23,435 --> 00:28:25,435
<i>I have a method all my own.</i>

471
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:30,190
<i>If you notice, the coat came
first, then the tie, then the shirt.</i>

472
00:28:30,292 --> 00:28:34,994
<i>Now, according to Hoyle, after
that, the pants should be next.</i>

473
00:28:35,096 --> 00:28:36,763
<i>There's where I'm different.</i>

474
00:28:39,685 --> 00:28:42,819
- Where are we
with Billy Sheehan?
- Ready. I helped put him under.

475
00:28:42,921 --> 00:28:45,321
- Prepped and positioned.
- We said I was handling that.

476
00:28:45,424 --> 00:28:48,058
We did. I wanted everything
ready for Dr. Shepherd.

477
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,561
Your first day and you're
making my life easier.

478
00:28:50,663 --> 00:28:52,930
Yeah. Dr. Kepner, she's
not just a good doctor.

479
00:28:53,032 --> 00:28:56,683
She's a great doctor. In fact,
she's the future of medicine.

480
00:28:56,785 --> 00:28:59,186
Only you can keep
yourself down, right?

481
00:29:01,473 --> 00:29:03,473
By the way, I can tell.

482
00:29:07,262 --> 00:29:10,029
Dr. Shepherd, I
just need a moment.

483
00:29:16,705 --> 00:29:19,839
Look at this. Acute on
chronic subdural hematoma.

484
00:29:19,941 --> 00:29:22,259
- That's not mets.
- It's a brain bleed.

485
00:29:22,361 --> 00:29:24,344
Which explains aphasia
and the numbness.

486
00:29:24,446 --> 00:29:26,763
Would explain
everything. I'll tell Neuro.

487
00:29:26,865 --> 00:29:28,781
No, nice try. I'll tell Neuro.

488
00:29:28,884 --> 00:29:31,195
I'm the one that said
it was a brain issue.

489
00:29:31,219 --> 00:29:33,737
The only reason why you
knew that was I got the ball rolling

490
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:36,789
- by diagnosing
carotid stenosis.
- Give it a rest.

491
00:29:36,891 --> 00:29:39,709
Didn't you hear what
Goldman's daughter said?

492
00:29:40,412 --> 00:29:42,178
Sorry.

493
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:46,433
- I'll stop if you stop.
- I've stopped. You can have it.

494
00:29:46,535 --> 00:29:48,935
Talk to Arizona Robbins.
She's head of Neuro.

495
00:29:53,375 --> 00:29:56,009
She's not really
head of Neuro, is she?

496
00:29:59,814 --> 00:30:01,981
- What happened?
- Push another two of Ativan!

497
00:30:02,083 --> 00:30:05,285
- Get me new chemistries
and an EKG!
- Get the crash cart now!

498
00:30:05,387 --> 00:30:06,786
Start ventilating her!

499
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:09,656
Torsades? You gave her
torsades? What did you do?!

500
00:30:09,758 --> 00:30:11,909
I didn't do anything!
You were with her last.

501
00:30:12,011 --> 00:30:14,577
- Page Bailey.
- I already did.

502
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,380
Clear! Clear!

503
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:35,098
I don't know you well
enough to talk about her.

504
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,000
We're not gonna do that.

505
00:30:41,607 --> 00:30:44,791
Most people think I was named
for the state, but it's not true.

506
00:30:44,893 --> 00:30:47,494
I was named for a battleship.

507
00:30:47,596 --> 00:30:50,330
The<i> USS Arizona.</i>

508
00:30:50,432 --> 00:30:53,032
My grandfather was
serving on the<i> Arizona</i>

509
00:30:53,135 --> 00:30:55,179
when the Japanese
bombed Pearl Harbor,

510
00:30:55,203 --> 00:31:00,106
and he saved 19 men
before he drowned.

511
00:31:02,578 --> 00:31:04,656
Everything my father
did his whole life

512
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:07,697
was about honoring
that sacrifice.

513
00:31:08,917 --> 00:31:12,151
I was raised to be a
good man in a storm.

514
00:31:12,253 --> 00:31:14,287
Raised to love my country,

515
00:31:14,389 --> 00:31:17,990
love my family and
protect the things I love.

516
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:21,294
When my father,

517
00:31:21,396 --> 00:31:24,497
Colonel Daniel Robbins of
the United States Marine Corps,

518
00:31:24,599 --> 00:31:30,169
heard that I was a lesbian, he
said he only had one question.

519
00:31:30,271 --> 00:31:35,308
I was prepared for, "How fast can
you get the hell out of my house?"

520
00:31:37,463 --> 00:31:39,563
But instead...

521
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:46,519
it was, "Are you still
who I raised you to be?"

522
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:54,361
My father believes in country
the way that you believe in God.

523
00:31:54,463 --> 00:31:56,241
And my father's not
a man who bends,

524
00:31:56,265 --> 00:31:59,999
but he bent for me
because I'm his daughter.

525
00:32:02,037 --> 00:32:05,738
I'm a good man in a storm.

526
00:32:10,612 --> 00:32:15,232
I love your daughter. And
I protect the things I love.

527
00:32:16,635 --> 00:32:19,369
Not that I need to.
She doesn't need it.

528
00:32:19,471 --> 00:32:24,957
She's strong and
caring and honorable.

529
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:29,062
And she's who
you raised her to be.

530
00:32:48,033 --> 00:32:51,434
- She's alive. Barely.
- She still gonna get
the kidney?

531
00:32:51,536 --> 00:32:53,536
I'm asking the
questions right now.

532
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:57,274
Dr. Percy here tells me you
were in charge of Sarah's dialysis.

533
00:32:57,375 --> 00:32:59,075
- Is that true?
- Yes.

534
00:32:59,178 --> 00:33:02,345
He also says that you
were pretty upset with him.

535
00:33:02,447 --> 00:33:04,558
I don't see what that
has to do with anything.

536
00:33:04,582 --> 00:33:07,801
It has to do with the
fact that your mental state

537
00:33:07,903 --> 00:33:09,714
may have clouded your judgment,

538
00:33:09,738 --> 00:33:12,489
may have made you a
less competent doctor,

539
00:33:12,591 --> 00:33:18,211
may have led you to read the
labs wrong or not read them at all.

540
00:33:18,313 --> 00:33:22,032
Otherwise, why would you
tell the tech to give Sarah

541
00:33:22,134 --> 00:33:24,201
a zero K bath

542
00:33:24,303 --> 00:33:29,122
when her potassium
this morning was 3.4?

543
00:33:31,393 --> 00:33:34,594
You sucked all the
potassium out of that woman.

544
00:33:34,696 --> 00:33:37,480
You stopped her heart.

545
00:33:37,582 --> 00:33:39,833
She's alive, but she's
not getting her kidney.

546
00:33:39,935 --> 00:33:43,620
After three years of waiting,

547
00:33:43,722 --> 00:33:45,922
somebody else will
be getting her kidney.

548
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:50,527
And if we don't find her another
one in the next three days,

549
00:33:50,629 --> 00:33:55,165
she's going to be dead.
And you will have killed her.

550
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:13,233
Surgery went pretty well,
Mr. Sheehan. Good bone alignment.

551
00:34:13,335 --> 00:34:16,775
Then I'll be back to my old
self? I'll be able to get around?

552
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:22,092
Get around, yes. To where
you were, no. Probably not.

553
00:34:22,194 --> 00:34:27,313
Probably about 70 percent. Which
is good, considering your injuries.

554
00:34:31,936 --> 00:34:35,889
I guess that means I only
steal 70 percent as much stuff.

555
00:34:35,991 --> 00:34:37,974
Billy...

556
00:34:44,449 --> 00:34:45,948
See this?

557
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:49,703
I noticed this afternoon there
were splotches all over the page.

558
00:34:49,805 --> 00:34:55,241
They're tears. She was
crying when she wrote this stuff.

559
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:57,377
She's scared.

560
00:34:57,479 --> 00:35:02,465
And these stupid little sayings,
they make her feel better.

561
00:35:02,567 --> 00:35:07,387
This is her comfort. We
stole her comfort from her.

562
00:35:07,489 --> 00:35:10,156
You and me, we're
taking things from people

563
00:35:10,258 --> 00:35:13,126
and leaving them at 70 percent.

564
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:23,903
You promised.

565
00:35:24,005 --> 00:35:27,908
You promised my nieces
I was getting this kidney.

566
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:30,510
I'm sorry. I am...

567
00:35:30,612 --> 00:35:32,445
so, so sorry.

568
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:36,816
But I'm going to make this right.
I'm going to get you another kidney.

569
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:45,408
It's my sister.

570
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:50,646
What do I tell her?

571
00:36:12,854 --> 00:36:15,304
I'm sorry.

572
00:36:15,407 --> 00:36:19,643
It must be hard, being the
new people, being the invaders.

573
00:36:21,112 --> 00:36:23,980
But that's no excuse
for you being...

574
00:36:26,468 --> 00:36:29,803
I don't like you.

575
00:36:29,905 --> 00:36:34,373
But what I did, that
was over the line.

576
00:36:45,787 --> 00:36:48,988
I'm sorry. I thought
you wanted to see me.

577
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:52,692
This is Missy Grant
from Human Resources.

578
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:58,281
You're kidding me.

579
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:00,333
You're firing me?

580
00:37:00,435 --> 00:37:02,096
- Stevens...
- You can't!

581
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:06,172
You can't fire me for having
cancer! That's five kinds of illegal!

582
00:37:06,274 --> 00:37:07,957
This is not about the cancer.

583
00:37:11,379 --> 00:37:13,579
It's about the kidney patient?

584
00:37:15,867 --> 00:37:18,952
I made a mistake. I...

585
00:37:19,054 --> 00:37:22,172
- Doctors make mistakes
every day.
- Yes, but...

586
00:37:22,274 --> 00:37:23,951
You let me back
after I cut an LVAD!

587
00:37:23,975 --> 00:37:27,677
That was a different
era. Times have changed.

588
00:37:27,779 --> 00:37:31,047
Dr. Shepherd and Dr. Hunt

589
00:37:31,149 --> 00:37:34,934
had concerns about your
stamina and emotional stability.

590
00:37:35,036 --> 00:37:40,189
- And Dr. Karev has questions...
- Alex? Alex said something
to you?

591
00:37:40,291 --> 00:37:42,559
Dr. Webber.

592
00:37:50,402 --> 00:37:53,269
In the wake of the
merger with Mercy West,

593
00:37:53,371 --> 00:37:56,706
the needs of the
hospital have changed.

594
00:37:56,808 --> 00:38:00,610
While performance is evaluated,

595
00:38:00,712 --> 00:38:03,913
the largest considerations
are budgetary.

596
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:08,351
There was simply
no room on the staff.

597
00:38:22,433 --> 00:38:24,767
Please don't do this to me.

598
00:38:26,621 --> 00:38:29,521
Please don't take
this away from me.

599
00:38:29,624 --> 00:38:34,326
I don't have
anything left. Please...

600
00:38:34,428 --> 00:38:37,764
<i>What do you do when
the infection hits you?</i>

601
00:38:37,866 --> 00:38:40,332
- Calliope.
- <i>When it takes over?</i>

602
00:38:40,435 --> 00:38:43,503
I can't do this anymore.
You'll, you know, see me in hell.

603
00:38:43,605 --> 00:38:45,738
Listen to me, please.

604
00:38:47,726 --> 00:38:50,043
I have to catch you.

605
00:38:50,145 --> 00:38:52,345
- What?
- Your whole life...

606
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:56,782
You've always been
on a bridge, Calliope,

607
00:38:56,884 --> 00:38:59,152
ever since you
were a little girl.

608
00:38:59,254 --> 00:39:03,022
And you don't just walk on it,
either, you climb on the railing.

609
00:39:03,124 --> 00:39:05,358
You're ready to leap.

610
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:09,262
And when you do,
when that happens,

611
00:39:09,364 --> 00:39:12,148
I have to be there.
I have to catch you.

612
00:39:13,919 --> 00:39:17,720
- You don't have
to catch me, Dad.
- Yes, I do.

613
00:39:19,624 --> 00:39:21,273
That's my job.

614
00:39:28,383 --> 00:39:32,819
If this works out
between you and Arizona,

615
00:39:32,921 --> 00:39:35,505
is there a chance,
maybe, you'd...

616
00:39:37,008 --> 00:39:40,810
give your mother a wedding?

617
00:39:40,912 --> 00:39:44,581
If Arizona wanted to spend
the rest of her life with me?

618
00:39:45,951 --> 00:39:49,619
Yeah, I'll put on a big white
dress and dance down the aisle.

619
00:39:50,488 --> 00:39:52,655
How about grandkids?

620
00:39:52,757 --> 00:39:56,058
Yes, I would imagine...

621
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:00,746
when the time
came, there'd be kids.

622
00:40:04,619 --> 00:40:08,504
- Does she make you happy?
- Yes, Dad.

623
00:40:08,606 --> 00:40:11,107
She makes me very happy.

624
00:40:15,113 --> 00:40:16,713
I love you. You know that?

625
00:40:18,483 --> 00:40:22,752
She's not a vegetarian, is she? I
don't know how much more I can take.

626
00:40:22,854 --> 00:40:26,256
She's not a vegetarian.

627
00:40:26,358 --> 00:40:28,807
I feel very old.

628
00:40:31,812 --> 00:40:36,349
<i>Do you do what you're supposed
to and take your medicine?</i>

629
00:40:36,451 --> 00:40:38,751
<i>Or do you learn to
live with the thing,</i>

630
00:40:39,921 --> 00:40:42,354
<i>and hope someday it goes away?</i>

631
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:18,173
Tell me everything.
Did you beat them?

632
00:41:18,275 --> 00:41:21,778
Did you kick their asses?
Come on, I want a full report.

633
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,713
Everything that happened.

634
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:29,301
Izzie left me.

635
00:41:30,722 --> 00:41:34,657
She wrote a note
and she left me. I...

636
00:41:35,994 --> 00:41:38,561
I don't know if
she's coming back.

637
00:41:40,031 --> 00:41:42,699
What do you mean she
left? Where did she go?

638
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:54,427
Go hug him.

639
00:41:54,528 --> 00:41:57,296
- What?
- Go hug him.

640
00:42:16,985 --> 00:42:20,103
<i>Or do you just give up entirely,</i>

641
00:42:20,205 --> 00:42:22,405
<i>and let it kill you?</i>
