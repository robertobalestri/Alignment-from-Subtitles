1
00:00:15,799 --> 00:00:18,033
<i>Dying isn't easy.</i>

2
00:00:21,605 --> 00:00:25,040
<i>The body was
designed to stay alive.</i>

3
00:00:25,909 --> 00:00:28,577
<i>Thick skulls...</i>

4
00:00:28,678 --> 00:00:30,345
<i>strong hearts...</i>

5
00:00:31,498 --> 00:00:33,865
<i>keen senses.</i>

6
00:00:55,038 --> 00:00:58,974
Morning.

7
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:00,959
Morning.

8
00:01:10,654 --> 00:01:13,188
<i>When the body starts to fail...</i>

9
00:01:14,141 --> 00:01:17,209
<i>medicine takes over.</i>

10
00:01:18,946 --> 00:01:22,814
Morning. Kim, Sean.
How're you feeling?

11
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:26,718
Ready. Today's the day.

12
00:01:27,338 --> 00:01:28,770
How are you doing?

13
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:31,256
OK.

14
00:01:31,358 --> 00:01:34,209
<i>Surgeons are
arrogant enough to think</i>

15
00:01:34,311 --> 00:01:37,078
<i>there's no one we can't save.</i>

16
00:01:37,915 --> 00:01:39,614
- You need a consult?
- Kim Allan.

17
00:01:39,716 --> 00:01:41,728
She has stage-four
large cell lung cancer.

18
00:01:41,752 --> 00:01:44,631
I removed a second mass from
her right lung about two months ago,

19
00:01:44,655 --> 00:01:46,365
but tests show the
cancer had spread

20
00:01:46,389 --> 00:01:48,618
to her lymph nodes
and to her liver.

21
00:01:48,642 --> 00:01:51,927
She was readmitted last
week with pulmonary edema.

22
00:01:52,029 --> 00:01:53,306
I drained as much
fluid as I could,

23
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:55,611
but she's having a
tough time breathing.

24
00:01:55,666 --> 00:01:58,200
That's too bad. You
gonna have to intubate her?

25
00:01:58,301 --> 00:02:01,236
- She doesn't want that.
- You have to treat her
palliatively.

26
00:02:01,338 --> 00:02:03,805
I don't see what else
we can do for her.

27
00:02:03,907 --> 00:02:07,475
- She wants us to help her die.
<i>- Like I said,</i>

28
00:02:07,578 --> 00:02:09,528
<i>dying isn't easy.</i>

29
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:15,600
Since the state requires
two physicians' signatures,

30
00:02:15,702 --> 00:02:18,062
I've asked Dr. Hunt
to look over your chart.

31
00:02:18,905 --> 00:02:20,855
OK.

32
00:02:20,957 --> 00:02:24,009
Her prognosis says that she
has less than six months to live.

33
00:02:24,111 --> 00:02:27,479
I have informed her of
her treatment options.

34
00:02:27,581 --> 00:02:30,215
She has met with a
psychologist who has determined

35
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:32,183
that she is mentally fit.

36
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:35,737
And this can serve as
her second oral request.

37
00:02:36,723 --> 00:02:39,507
OK.

38
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,444
You have to say it.

39
00:02:42,563 --> 00:02:45,096
Washington State says

40
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:49,100
I have to hear you ask two
times at least 15 days apart.

41
00:02:49,185 --> 00:02:51,019
It's so weird.

42
00:02:51,121 --> 00:02:52,654
It's like I'm applying to die.

43
00:02:52,772 --> 00:02:54,067
If you're having
second thoughts...

44
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:56,624
You saw how bad
it got last night.

45
00:02:56,726 --> 00:02:58,259
It's just gonna get worse.

46
00:03:01,148 --> 00:03:05,483
I would like to end my life

47
00:03:05,586 --> 00:03:08,086
through
physician-assisted suicide.

48
00:03:13,626 --> 00:03:14,959
Excuse me, um...

49
00:03:20,901 --> 00:03:23,001
I'm just gonna go see what's up.

50
00:03:23,103 --> 00:03:24,802
Dr. Altman?

51
00:03:25,805 --> 00:03:27,022
How long does it take?

52
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:29,056
To die?

53
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:30,458
Once I take the barbiturates.

54
00:03:30,578 --> 00:03:34,980
Can we not talk about
this? It's just, um...

55
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:37,115
We're not there yet.

56
00:03:39,003 --> 00:03:40,869
We are there, Sean.

57
00:03:41,755 --> 00:03:43,488
We are.

58
00:03:46,477 --> 00:03:48,626
Kim, to answer your question...

59
00:03:49,929 --> 00:03:51,896
about 45 minutes.

60
00:03:52,932 --> 00:03:55,567
It takes about
45 minutes to die.

61
00:03:58,004 --> 00:04:00,872
Three dates. No
sex. Just talking.

62
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:02,886
Do you have any idea
how much you can learn

63
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,387
about someone if
you remain upright?

64
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:07,178
I bet you didn't know Teddy
hates the word "moist."

65
00:04:07,281 --> 00:04:10,115
Hates it. Would really
prefer people say "damp."

66
00:04:10,217 --> 00:04:13,802
You hear me? I'm growing again.

67
00:04:13,904 --> 00:04:16,299
- I'm, like, grown.
- - She's making cartilage from scratch.

68
00:04:16,323 --> 00:04:19,691
She's preoccupied
these days. It's super hot.

69
00:04:19,793 --> 00:04:22,794
- I'm gonna be late.
- Bye.

70
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:27,582
She doesn't want kids.

71
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:31,086
Arizona doesn't want kids. In
her womb, in her house. Ever.

72
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:33,304
- She told me.
- What did you say?

73
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:36,091
Nothing. We're doing so
great. I don't want to ruin it

74
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:38,304
by being the crazy desperate
girl with the aching womb.

75
00:04:38,328 --> 00:04:40,078
Better than being the
crazy childless woman

76
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,225
who sits at the playground
watching the children play.

77
00:04:42,249 --> 00:04:45,067
They have laws
for people like that.

78
00:04:45,169 --> 00:04:46,768
You gotta tell her.

79
00:04:49,572 --> 00:04:51,690
So in the third quarter
of the collection,

80
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:54,025
rate of Medicaid was
what percent again?

81
00:04:55,012 --> 00:04:57,412
Hey. Would you
excuse me one second?

82
00:04:59,032 --> 00:05:00,966
OK. You have 30 seconds.

83
00:05:01,068 --> 00:05:03,651
OK. So this woman comes
into the ER with abdominal pain.

84
00:05:03,753 --> 00:05:06,015
She's had it on and
off for about six months,

85
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:09,491
and a lot of doctors have told
her it's either an ulcer or gastritis.

86
00:05:09,593 --> 00:05:11,293
Get to the point.
You have 15 seconds.

87
00:05:11,395 --> 00:05:13,895
So it occurs to me that the
nausea is probably caused

88
00:05:13,997 --> 00:05:16,364
- by a positional shift...
- CSF. Brain tumor. Got it.

89
00:05:16,467 --> 00:05:20,101
Not just any brain tumor. She's
got this huge, beautiful ependymoma.

90
00:05:20,203 --> 00:05:21,914
- So Shadow Shepherd...
- Dr. Nelson.

91
00:05:21,938 --> 00:05:26,024
OK, Shadow Shepherd is going
to do intraventricular resection

92
00:05:26,126 --> 00:05:27,542
and let me assist.

93
00:05:27,644 --> 00:05:29,956
And I may even get
to debulk the tumor.

94
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:31,813
That's it?

95
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:34,582
OK, sorry for the interruption.

96
00:05:34,684 --> 00:05:36,217
So where were we?

97
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:39,504
Percentage third quarter Medicaid.
What was the rate of return?

98
00:05:41,642 --> 00:05:43,219
- How close?
- Two minutes.

99
00:05:43,243 --> 00:05:46,004
- It's Nicole, right?
- Three guys waiting
on an ambulance?

100
00:05:46,062 --> 00:05:48,997
- Must be Nicole
behind the wheel.
- Have you seen her ass?

101
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:50,465
Man, I'd love to hit that.

102
00:05:50,567 --> 00:05:54,486
- Morning, chief.
- Sorry about that, chief.

103
00:05:54,588 --> 00:05:56,938
It's quite all right.
And I am not the chief.

104
00:06:00,727 --> 00:06:02,476
- Hey, Nicole!
- Hey.

105
00:06:02,578 --> 00:06:05,664
Nick Kelsey, 32, injured
skiing off a helicopter.

106
00:06:05,766 --> 00:06:09,367
- Vital signs are stable.
- Wasn't the helicopter
that did it.

107
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:11,330
- It was the avalanche.
- Idiotic either way.

108
00:06:11,354 --> 00:06:14,567
He's got two idiot friends coming in
behind him but he's got the worst of it.

109
00:06:14,591 --> 00:06:18,226
Open fracture to the left
tibia and left hip fracture.

110
00:06:22,249 --> 00:06:24,549
What are you looking at, chachi?

111
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:31,082
What happened? We were
in the middle of a consult.

112
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:33,474
You're her doctor. You
shouldn't push her to do that.

113
00:06:33,576 --> 00:06:36,661
I offered her options. I
told her about hospice.

114
00:06:36,746 --> 00:06:39,481
She doesn't want to die a slow
death hooked up to machines

115
00:06:39,582 --> 00:06:42,616
or be so heavily sedated
she might as well be dead.

116
00:06:42,719 --> 00:06:45,653
And I have to say, I don't
blame her. This is an act of mercy.

117
00:06:45,755 --> 00:06:48,390
Act of mercy? You're killing
her. Just so you're clear,

118
00:06:48,492 --> 00:06:51,959
by writing that prescription,
you're killing that woman.

119
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:56,080
All right, then.

120
00:06:56,182 --> 00:07:01,269
I'll find someone else.

121
00:07:08,195 --> 00:07:10,045
Watch it, watch it! Heads up!

122
00:07:10,147 --> 00:07:13,343
You need to work on your
passing game, Hunt, you ball hog.

123
00:07:13,367 --> 00:07:15,233
You need to work on your game!

124
00:07:15,335 --> 00:07:17,736
- On your four!
- No!

125
00:07:17,838 --> 00:07:21,105
- Not a chance, major!
- Get it!

126
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:24,810
- Watch out, watch out,
watch out!
- I got him! I got him!

127
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,750
Break it up, break it
up, break it up, you two.

128
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:35,403
- We're only down by three.
- Yeah, because you suck!

129
00:07:35,505 --> 00:07:36,971
Don't be insubordinate.

130
00:07:37,073 --> 00:07:38,406
Sir, you suck, sir.

131
00:07:38,508 --> 00:07:42,326
- I mean, Dan, you play
like my grandma.
- Whatever.

132
00:07:54,508 --> 00:07:57,342
Get your battle rattle.
Time to go to work.

133
00:08:07,287 --> 00:08:09,454
Owen, come on!

134
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:32,522
I need to reduce this ankle
dislocation. Give him ten of morphine.

135
00:08:32,546 --> 00:08:34,990
We need to treat his frostbite.
You like the tips of your fingers?

136
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:37,593
- Yes, please.
- You jumped out of
a helicopter on skis?

137
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:40,001
Yeah. You can't get powder
like that anywhere else.

138
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:42,069
I'm seeing fluid
around your kidney.

139
00:08:42,171 --> 00:08:44,272
We're gonna need to
do a CT of your abdomen.

140
00:08:44,374 --> 00:08:46,853
Do what you gotta do. Me and
the guys are running with the bulls

141
00:08:46,877 --> 00:08:50,244
in Pamplona next year.
Gotta be up on my feet.

142
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:57,785
Hey, Phil, tell those doctors
they need to fix you up

143
00:08:57,887 --> 00:09:00,655
so you can run with
the bulls next year!

144
00:09:00,757 --> 00:09:03,391
- You're an active guy.
- Once a year, anyhow.

145
00:09:03,493 --> 00:09:06,011
Better than nothing. Once
a year, we live like men.

146
00:09:06,113 --> 00:09:08,663
- You almost died like men.
- On my count.

147
00:09:08,765 --> 00:09:11,916
One, two, three!

148
00:09:13,186 --> 00:09:15,426
Big-ass car bomb
waxed half their unit.

149
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:17,567
They tried to evac, but it
turned into an insurgent fire-fight.

150
00:09:17,591 --> 00:09:21,259
GSW to the abdomen. Let's
stabilize him till we get him to an OR.

151
00:09:21,361 --> 00:09:23,762
Get me some wet bandages
and an occlusive dressing.

152
00:09:23,864 --> 00:09:25,079
All out of those.

153
00:09:25,181 --> 00:09:29,017
OK, uh... some
wet towels and, uh...

154
00:09:29,119 --> 00:09:32,337
That. We'll close him with this.

155
00:09:34,591 --> 00:09:37,792
Gekko, give me that
roll of two-inch tape.

156
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:43,815
I need a laryngoscope and
E-T tube. I need to intubate!

157
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:46,534
- Finish this!
- I'm on it!

158
00:09:46,636 --> 00:09:49,821
- Pupils fixed and dilated.
- He's way past go.

159
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:51,772
- Who's next?
- Over here, sir!

160
00:09:51,874 --> 00:09:55,009
Colonel Mooney, sir, sandstorm's
coming. Command's ordered us to move.

161
00:09:55,111 --> 00:09:57,662
- You're kidding me. When?
- Now, sir.

162
00:09:57,764 --> 00:10:00,164
All right. People,
secure your patients.

163
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,660
I almost have my guy stabilized.

164
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:03,029
You'll ride with him
on the medevac.

165
00:10:03,053 --> 00:10:05,169
Take my amputation
and the head trauma too.

166
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:09,090
Hunt, we'll take your GSW
in the APC. Let's move!

167
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:11,854
- Want me to go?
- No, I'm fine.

168
00:10:11,878 --> 00:10:14,612
- You hate helicopters.
- I know.

169
00:10:14,714 --> 00:10:17,498
I'm fine. I'll see
you back there.

170
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,633
- See you back there.
- Yep.

171
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:24,038
Shall we scan him first?

172
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:29,138
See what kind of
damage we're dealing with

173
00:10:29,162 --> 00:10:31,407
in case we need an OR. He's
got some abdominal bruising.

174
00:10:31,431 --> 00:10:34,548
Yeah. Yeah, OK. You take this.

175
00:10:35,618 --> 00:10:37,284
Uh, get him up to CT.

176
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:39,587
How come you didn't
get hurt in the avalanche?

177
00:10:39,689 --> 00:10:41,873
I never got off the
helicopter. I was about to jump

178
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:43,095
when the avalanche started.

179
00:10:43,126 --> 00:10:45,343
You missed it, Tommy.
Friggin' awesome!

180
00:10:45,445 --> 00:10:47,712
Yeah, Tommy, friggin' awesome!

181
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:50,899
Yeah, Tommy, friggin' awesome.

182
00:10:54,905 --> 00:10:57,739
Dr. Altman said you requested
to lower your pain meds?

183
00:10:57,841 --> 00:11:00,157
They make me fuzzy.

184
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:02,610
I don't want to be fuzzy today.

185
00:11:02,712 --> 00:11:04,178
Did she tell you?

186
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,548
That you're going home? Yeah.

187
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:08,366
- I changed my mind.
- What?

188
00:11:08,468 --> 00:11:10,551
No, no, not about...

189
00:11:10,653 --> 00:11:13,254
I just... I want to do it here.

190
00:11:13,356 --> 00:11:14,672
In the hospital.

191
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:17,491
I don't want Sean to have to
deal with my body afterwards.

192
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:18,804
Don't worry about that stuff.

193
00:11:18,828 --> 00:11:20,623
We can make this
place like home.

194
00:11:20,647 --> 00:11:23,614
You know? Get rid
of all these machines

195
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:26,401
and get some of our stuff,

196
00:11:26,503 --> 00:11:29,787
my quilt, some pictures.

197
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:32,457
Some wine.

198
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:36,377
- Can we have wine?
- I don't see why not.

199
00:11:36,479 --> 00:11:38,190
If you need wine, maybe
you don't really want...

200
00:11:38,214 --> 00:11:41,566
I don't need wine. I want wine.

201
00:11:41,668 --> 00:11:44,135
But I think you're
gonna need it.

202
00:11:44,237 --> 00:11:45,620
You seem scared.

203
00:11:46,773 --> 00:11:50,107
Are you... scared?

204
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,459
Stop worrying about me.

205
00:11:51,561 --> 00:11:53,038
All these things are happening,

206
00:11:53,062 --> 00:11:55,007
and I'm making
all these choices,

207
00:11:55,031 --> 00:11:58,365
and I have no idea
how you're feeling.

208
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:00,651
- I'm not feeling anything.
- Sean!

209
00:12:00,753 --> 00:12:03,165
I'm talking about
where I'm gonna die.

210
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:05,890
You have to be
feeling something!

211
00:12:10,363 --> 00:12:12,096
I'll go home and get the stuff.

212
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:13,515
Sean...

213
00:12:15,752 --> 00:12:17,484
Red or white?

214
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:21,205
Red.

215
00:12:21,307 --> 00:12:23,841
In a wine glass,
not a plastic cup.

216
00:12:23,926 --> 00:12:26,010
OK.

217
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:31,716
It never changes.

218
00:12:31,818 --> 00:12:35,770
You have the same fights. I
mean, even when you're dying,

219
00:12:35,872 --> 00:12:37,488
you have the same fights.

220
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,485
You want to know
how they're feeling,

221
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:41,476
and they don't want to tell you.

222
00:12:42,212 --> 00:12:44,546
- Sorry.
- Don't be.

223
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:49,783
I think they don't know.

224
00:12:49,886 --> 00:12:51,397
When you ask them
how they're feeling,

225
00:12:51,421 --> 00:12:53,315
and they don't want to tell you,

226
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:55,723
and you think
they're being difficult?

227
00:12:55,825 --> 00:12:58,065
I think they really don't know.

228
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:04,631
OK, relax. Deep
breaths. Deep breaths.

229
00:13:06,236 --> 00:13:07,468
Good.

230
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:16,427
Where do you stand on
physician-assisted suicide?

231
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:17,695
I'm not opposed to it.

232
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,791
As long as we're talking
about controversial stuff,

233
00:13:19,815 --> 00:13:22,550
let's get something straight:
Arena Football is not real football.

234
00:13:22,652 --> 00:13:24,452
Mark. Mark, wait.

235
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:28,322
This is not me getting
to know you. This is...

236
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:31,637
I have a patient who's terminal.

237
00:13:31,661 --> 00:13:35,530
She wants to die, and she
wants my help. And I want yours.

238
00:13:41,104 --> 00:13:43,337
See that? The tumor's
pressing down on the floor

239
00:13:43,439 --> 00:13:45,907
of the fourth ventricle,
which is causing the nausea.

240
00:13:46,008 --> 00:13:49,310
So you debulk the tumor, and
then you move on to the stalk?

241
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:51,279
No. You debulk the tumor.

242
00:13:51,381 --> 00:13:54,615
Dr. Shepherd has requested these
scans. His schedule has freed up.

243
00:13:54,717 --> 00:13:56,245
He's decided to do
the resection himself.

244
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:58,720
Oh, no! That's
my... I am debulking.

245
00:13:58,822 --> 00:14:01,856
- It's my tumor.
- It's Dr. Shepherd's tumor now.

246
00:14:14,254 --> 00:14:16,871
- Dr. Hunt, can I help you?
- No. No, I got it.

247
00:14:25,048 --> 00:14:28,099
Oscar-four-kilo,
this is echo-five-golf.

248
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:30,985
Oscar-four-kilo,
this is echo-five-golf.

249
00:14:31,087 --> 00:14:34,822
- Anything, sergeant?
- No, sir. I think
it's the storm.

250
00:14:34,924 --> 00:14:38,343
Well, they know we're
coming, right? All right.

251
00:14:39,362 --> 00:14:41,995
- Where are we going?
- Green Zone, baby.

252
00:14:42,097 --> 00:14:43,731
They'll stabilize you.

253
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:46,951
Then you are going to
a hospital in Germany,

254
00:14:47,036 --> 00:14:49,170
and then you're
gonna go home. OK?

255
00:14:51,657 --> 00:14:54,342
- Teddy get there yet?
- No word.

256
00:14:54,444 --> 00:14:57,712
Don't worry, I'm sure
your girl's just fine.

257
00:14:57,814 --> 00:14:59,898
Stop it. I'm serious.
We're friends.

258
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,269
Keep telling yourself that.

259
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:31,412
Hunt! You all right, Hunt?!

260
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:35,950
- I'm OK! You OK?
- Yeah.

261
00:15:36,586 --> 00:15:38,252
We must've hit an IED.

262
00:15:38,355 --> 00:15:42,523
- How're the patients?
- I don't know.

263
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,125
I gotta find 'em all.

264
00:16:02,778 --> 00:16:06,013
Everyone's gone. We lost Gekko.

265
00:16:07,816 --> 00:16:10,418
Dan? Dan!

266
00:16:14,674 --> 00:16:16,674
Owen?

267
00:16:18,244 --> 00:16:19,677
Owen?

268
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:23,647
- Owen.
- What?

269
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:25,183
You paged.

270
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:28,614
When you did Kim Allan's
evaluation, did you scope her?

271
00:16:28,638 --> 00:16:31,405
- What? Wait, is that her chart?
- Dr. Altman's patient,

272
00:16:31,507 --> 00:16:34,775
who, according to this, you ordered
pulmonary function tests one week ago.

273
00:16:34,877 --> 00:16:38,129
I'd like to know if, during that
evaluation, you did a bronchoscopy.

274
00:16:38,231 --> 00:16:40,242
- Is there a problem?
- Answer the question!

275
00:16:40,266 --> 00:16:43,100
- Why are you interrogating me?
- PFTs can give you
false positives,

276
00:16:43,203 --> 00:16:45,769
and a patient may kill
herself due to incorrect data.

277
00:16:45,872 --> 00:16:47,466
It's routine, so
we probably did.

278
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:49,006
Probably is good enough for you?

279
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:51,943
Probably is good
enough for Dr. Altman?

280
00:16:52,946 --> 00:16:55,396
What is going on? Are...?

281
00:16:57,033 --> 00:16:59,917
Owen.

282
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:03,388
- Did you call Lani?
- Um, you should call your wife.

283
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:06,707
She'll freak. Tommy,
call her when I go in.

284
00:17:06,809 --> 00:17:09,309
Downplay it. It's a broken leg.

285
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:10,872
A little frostbite
on your fingers,

286
00:17:10,896 --> 00:17:13,197
but nothing terrible.
You're about to...

287
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:16,684
scream really loud.

288
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:19,106
That was worse than when I
broke my ankle on Kilimanjaro.

289
00:17:19,155 --> 00:17:21,400
- You climbed Kilimanjaro?
- Couple years ago.

290
00:17:21,424 --> 00:17:23,904
I made it to the summit, while
these guys got altitude sickness

291
00:17:23,993 --> 00:17:27,011
- half a mile from the top.
- You guys
are hard-core.

292
00:17:27,113 --> 00:17:29,196
We gotta be. I sell insurance.

293
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:31,649
Phil and Tommy are accountants.

294
00:17:31,751 --> 00:17:34,735
These trips are all we got
to keep our blood moving.

295
00:17:34,837 --> 00:17:37,957
Show them the picture of you on
top of Kili with the rubber chicken.

296
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:42,476
That doesn't look like
you on a mountain.

297
00:17:42,578 --> 00:17:45,012
Oh, sorry. That's my
daughter, Hannah.

298
00:17:46,031 --> 00:17:47,765
Ladybug for Halloween.

299
00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:53,204
You telling me you
don't want one of those?

300
00:17:58,694 --> 00:18:01,123
You stole my surgery,
right out from under me.

301
00:18:01,147 --> 00:18:03,180
It wasn't your surgery.
It was Nelson's surgery.

302
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:06,345
It's beyond Nelson's skill level.
Right? That's what you said.

303
00:18:06,369 --> 00:18:11,004
My diagnosis, my tumor, my
debulking. Can I scrub in at least?

304
00:18:11,106 --> 00:18:12,640
You're on Nelson's service.

305
00:18:12,742 --> 00:18:14,336
If I switch you, it's
gonna look like favoritism.

306
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,722
- Dr. Nelson's been
given an aneurysm.
- You stop talking!

307
00:18:16,746 --> 00:18:20,765
- Calm down, people are staring.
- You stole my surgery.

308
00:18:23,536 --> 00:18:25,769
He stole my surgery!

309
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:31,058
- Everything OK?
- Yeah. It's fine.

310
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,928
Everything's, uh... fine.

311
00:18:35,181 --> 00:18:37,882
Have you had lunch yet
today? I'm headed down.

312
00:18:37,984 --> 00:18:39,427
I can't eat in the
cafeteria anymore.

313
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:40,913
Vultures won't leave me alone.

314
00:18:40,937 --> 00:18:43,704
- Vultures?
- People need things from me.

315
00:18:43,806 --> 00:18:46,535
Seems like everybody has a
pressing problem that can't wait.

316
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:49,911
- Shepherd, you have a minute?
- See?

317
00:18:55,117 --> 00:18:58,919
My lunch is making me sad,
and I haven't started eating it yet.

318
00:18:59,021 --> 00:19:01,205
- Say something.
- Shut up.

319
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:03,402
I was gonna go for lasagna. I don't
know why I didn't pull the trigger.

320
00:19:03,426 --> 00:19:05,893
- Say it.
- Shut up!

321
00:19:05,995 --> 00:19:07,522
- Say what?
- Nothing!

322
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:09,213
Hello?

323
00:19:20,693 --> 00:19:22,259
OK, then.

324
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:32,836
You don't say it, you're
gonna regret it for a long, long...

325
00:19:32,938 --> 00:19:36,340
- Enough!
- OK. What is it with you two?

326
00:19:36,442 --> 00:19:38,525
- What is your problem?!
- Teddy...

327
00:19:38,628 --> 00:19:42,295
You go to Shepherd behind my back
about a patient you don't even know.

328
00:19:42,397 --> 00:19:45,666
You have no idea what
she's been dealing with,

329
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:47,251
the kind of pain that she's in,

330
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:50,393
pain that's only gonna be worse
after I ram a tube down her throat

331
00:19:50,489 --> 00:19:52,406
because you're
having some problem

332
00:19:52,508 --> 00:19:55,476
with her exercising
her legal right to die.

333
00:19:55,578 --> 00:19:59,129
So I want to know what
the hell is your problem?

334
00:20:21,254 --> 00:20:24,221
You missed it. Altman tore
Hunt a new one in the cafeteria.

335
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:26,424
The whole hospital's
talking about it.

336
00:20:26,526 --> 00:20:27,875
Not to me.

337
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:31,278
I walk in a room, and all the
conversation grinds to a halt.

338
00:20:33,466 --> 00:20:38,052
Come on. You don't talk
locker-room talk in front of the coach.

339
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:41,255
I'm not a coach
anymore, I'm a player.

340
00:20:41,357 --> 00:20:43,857
I take a shower
like everybody else.

341
00:20:46,545 --> 00:20:50,681
Richard. You're a little
bit like everybody else,

342
00:20:50,783 --> 00:20:52,983
but mostly, you're
still the coach.

343
00:20:53,802 --> 00:20:55,302
It's a sign of respect.

344
00:20:55,404 --> 00:20:58,071
You'd be wrong to
take it any other way.

345
00:21:04,147 --> 00:21:06,587
You know the drill. We've
put you in a twilight state.

346
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:09,344
Next, we're gonna spray
lidocaine in the back of your throat

347
00:21:09,368 --> 00:21:11,313
- and pass the scope...
- I don't get it.

348
00:21:11,337 --> 00:21:14,188
She had this test last week. Is
there a chance the results are wrong?

349
00:21:14,289 --> 00:21:17,158
- It's very unlikely.
- But it's possible?

350
00:21:17,259 --> 00:21:19,860
You wouldn't put her through
this again for no reason.

351
00:21:19,962 --> 00:21:22,196
You must think there's a
chance the tests were wrong.

352
00:21:22,298 --> 00:21:24,949
There are questions being raised
that have nothing to do with...

353
00:21:25,051 --> 00:21:27,201
By who? Raised by who?

354
00:21:27,303 --> 00:21:29,486
- Sean...
- Just talk to me!

355
00:21:29,588 --> 00:21:32,673
'Cause I'm standing here
thinking my wife's gonna die today,

356
00:21:32,775 --> 00:21:34,541
and if that's not gonna happen,

357
00:21:34,643 --> 00:21:37,143
if there's a chance that
she might get better...

358
00:21:37,246 --> 00:21:39,045
Your wife isn't
gonna get better.

359
00:21:39,147 --> 00:21:43,250
This test is unnecessary, and
the hospital is covering its ass.

360
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:56,630
- Thank you.
- No problem.

361
00:21:59,334 --> 00:22:02,719
Julie, can you find out if
Dr. Bailey's on her way?

362
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:04,488
OK, doctor.

363
00:22:08,177 --> 00:22:10,010
If I wasn't happily married,

364
00:22:10,113 --> 00:22:11,912
I'd hit her.

365
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,467
I'd hit her hard.

366
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:24,925
Sir, I think what you
wanted to say was "hit that."

367
00:22:26,596 --> 00:22:29,930
I don't think you
wanted to say that at all.

368
00:22:41,877 --> 00:22:45,012
I hear Shepherd
took your surgery.

369
00:22:45,114 --> 00:22:48,265
- How'd you hear that?
- Apparently,
you yell really loud.

370
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:50,618
Well, I have to hold a
retractor for Shadow Shepherd

371
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,421
while Derek debulks my
tumor. So yes, I yell very loud.

372
00:22:55,491 --> 00:22:57,491
Yeah, well, the key
is to think of yourself

373
00:22:57,593 --> 00:23:01,712
- as one of the Whos
down in Whoville.
- What?

374
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:06,283
You know, when the Grinch
came down and stole their presents,

375
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:08,618
they didn't let that
ruin Christmas for them.

376
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,622
Instead, they came out
on Christmas morning,

377
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:13,891
and they sang.

378
00:23:15,828 --> 00:23:18,429
You're gonna go into that
surgery and you're gonna sing.

379
00:23:21,801 --> 00:23:25,152
Sing, Cindy Lou. Sing.

380
00:23:29,725 --> 00:23:32,625
Your scalp lac is small
enough that shooting in lidocaine

381
00:23:32,728 --> 00:23:35,088
would be more painful than
throwing in a couple staples.

382
00:23:35,131 --> 00:23:37,882
- Is this gonna hurt
like my fingers?
- Not too much.

383
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:44,755
Sorry. Sorry!

384
00:23:44,857 --> 00:23:47,358
OK, that's it. Got it.

385
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,021
The hand was swelling so much,

386
00:23:49,045 --> 00:23:51,165
it would have
popped the finger off.

387
00:23:53,632 --> 00:23:54,664
What?

388
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:56,233
You still trying
to save the arm.

389
00:23:56,335 --> 00:23:57,468
You gotta tourniquet it.

390
00:23:57,570 --> 00:24:01,071
- If I do, you'll lose it.
- It's not about the arm.

391
00:24:01,174 --> 00:24:03,285
If I can tie off that
brachial artery...

392
00:24:03,309 --> 00:24:07,327
Owen! It's not about the arm.

393
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,064
You're right. I
know. You're right.

394
00:24:13,102 --> 00:24:14,501
Dan, listen to me.

395
00:24:14,603 --> 00:24:18,038
The back of this truck, it is
trashed. Most of the supplies,

396
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:21,024
all of the morphine. There's
no morphine, no lidocaine.

397
00:24:22,328 --> 00:24:23,443
You bring whiskey?

398
00:24:29,601 --> 00:24:33,387
OK, we got it. We
got it. We got it.

399
00:24:35,257 --> 00:24:38,074
No... I don't think we do.

400
00:24:50,189 --> 00:24:51,888
Dr. Hunt?

401
00:24:52,891 --> 00:24:54,325
Dr. Hunt?

402
00:24:56,028 --> 00:24:59,580
Kim Allan's bronchoscopy confirmed
that nothing more can be done.

403
00:24:59,682 --> 00:25:03,234
Sloan signed off. He did
his due diligence, but it's over.

404
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:06,269
You're not gonna kill him.

405
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:09,072
I won't let you kill him.

406
00:25:10,142 --> 00:25:12,042
- You're not gonna kill him.
- Dr. Hunt!

407
00:25:13,045 --> 00:25:15,896
The patient in
question is a woman,

408
00:25:15,998 --> 00:25:17,998
and no one is
trying to kill her.

409
00:25:18,483 --> 00:25:20,584
She's choosing to die.

410
00:25:24,056 --> 00:25:26,473
You should go home.

411
00:25:26,575 --> 00:25:29,526
- I have a surgery.
- You're done for the day.

412
00:25:29,628 --> 00:25:31,428
Go home.

413
00:25:37,853 --> 00:25:40,054
OK. OK.

414
00:25:40,156 --> 00:25:41,922
Can you... can you hold this?

415
00:25:42,024 --> 00:25:45,008
- Can you put pressure there?
- I don't...

416
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:48,262
OK, I'm gonna have to move you.

417
00:25:48,363 --> 00:25:50,798
I can't. I can't. I'm too tired.

418
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:53,717
No, no, no! Dan,
wake up! Wake up!

419
00:25:53,819 --> 00:25:55,786
I have to.

420
00:25:55,888 --> 00:25:59,122
It's gonna hurt like hell,
but I have to find something

421
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:01,175
to pack this wound
till someone comes.

422
00:26:01,277 --> 00:26:03,977
Someone's coming?
Someone's coming?

423
00:26:04,997 --> 00:26:07,580
OK, here we go.

424
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,683
Here we go.

425
00:26:11,354 --> 00:26:13,720
OK, here we go.

426
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:18,275
Please, please! Please! Please!

427
00:26:20,011 --> 00:26:23,497
Sorry. I'm sorry.
Sorry. I'm sorry.

428
00:26:27,553 --> 00:26:29,953
There we go. There we go.

429
00:26:30,039 --> 00:26:33,857
Hypothermia.
That's the last one.

430
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,044
Stop that.

431
00:26:37,146 --> 00:26:41,131
Someone is coming.
Help is coming.

432
00:26:41,233 --> 00:26:45,185
You've been
saying that for hours.

433
00:26:45,287 --> 00:26:49,372
I'm coagulopathic.
I'm probably acidotic.

434
00:26:49,474 --> 00:26:51,791
I'm in the triad of death.

435
00:26:53,145 --> 00:26:54,878
No one is coming.

436
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:57,597
- If I could just move you.
- I need you.

437
00:26:57,699 --> 00:27:00,667
I need you to say
a Hail Mary with me.

438
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:01,986
Dan.

439
00:27:04,556 --> 00:27:07,891
- I don't know it.
- That's OK.

440
00:27:07,994 --> 00:27:10,074
It's OK. Just say it with me.

441
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:16,983
- Hail Mary...
- Hail Mary...

442
00:27:17,086 --> 00:27:18,713
- full of grace.
- Full of grace.

443
00:27:18,737 --> 00:27:20,965
- The Lord is with Thee.
- The Lord is with Thee.

444
00:27:20,989 --> 00:27:22,333
Blessed art thou among women...

445
00:27:22,357 --> 00:27:23,807
Blessed art thou among women...

446
00:27:23,909 --> 00:27:26,054
blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

447
00:27:26,078 --> 00:27:27,439
Blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

448
00:27:27,463 --> 00:27:29,930
- Holy Mary, Mother of God.
- Holy Mary, Mother of God.

449
00:27:30,032 --> 00:27:31,860
- Pray for us sinners...
- Pray for us sinners...

450
00:27:31,884 --> 00:27:33,662
now and the hour of our death.

451
00:27:33,686 --> 00:27:35,118
Now and the hour of our death.

452
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:37,471
- Amen.
- Amen.

453
00:27:38,974 --> 00:27:42,309
Make sure Lisa gets
my ring. All right?

454
00:27:42,411 --> 00:27:43,477
Don't give up, Dan.

455
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:47,080
Don't use it to propose
to Altman or something.

456
00:27:48,217 --> 00:27:51,418
But you should
propose to Altman.

457
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,886
You know, you two... You should.

458
00:27:53,989 --> 00:27:56,040
- You should.
- Shut up. I'm engaged to Beth.

459
00:27:56,142 --> 00:27:59,476
And you, you're gonna
give that ring to Lisa.

460
00:27:59,578 --> 00:28:01,445
OK?

461
00:28:02,748 --> 00:28:05,416
- Come on. Come on.
- No.

462
00:28:05,518 --> 00:28:07,351
- Move your hand.
- No.

463
00:28:07,453 --> 00:28:10,970
- That's an order, soldier.
- No, sir.

464
00:28:25,754 --> 00:28:27,832
They're working
on Nick's kidney.

465
00:28:27,856 --> 00:28:29,867
I was able to
stabilize his legs,

466
00:28:29,891 --> 00:28:32,342
but it's gonna be a
long recovery process.

467
00:28:32,444 --> 00:28:35,256
You may need to let his wife know
it's a little bit more than a broken leg.

468
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:38,548
Yeah. I told my wife,
and she's calling Lani.

469
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:41,018
My wife can handle her better.

470
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,954
So you summited Kili,
you run with the bulls,

471
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:46,234
but you're scared
of your friend's wife?

472
00:28:46,258 --> 00:28:49,025
I was scared on Kili.

473
00:28:50,328 --> 00:28:52,412
- I hated every minute of it.
- So why do it?

474
00:28:52,514 --> 00:28:54,147
Nick and Phil.

475
00:28:54,249 --> 00:28:57,634
They're my boys. And
they love adventure.

476
00:28:57,736 --> 00:29:00,003
Me? I got a kid.

477
00:29:00,105 --> 00:29:02,188
And bad knees.

478
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:05,292
But I can't ruin it. We're
a team, you know?

479
00:29:05,394 --> 00:29:08,662
- So you just suck it up?
- Close my eyes

480
00:29:08,764 --> 00:29:10,447
and hope I don't die.

481
00:29:13,235 --> 00:29:15,062
I can't actually
give you the drugs,

482
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:19,489
but you can have this prescription
filled in the hospital pharmacy.

483
00:29:21,627 --> 00:29:24,911
Again, I want to emphasize
there are other options.

484
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:26,779
We can make you comfortable.

485
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:29,599
- I just have one question.
- Owen, no.

486
00:29:29,701 --> 00:29:32,185
What if they find a cure? I
know that it's a long shot,

487
00:29:32,287 --> 00:29:34,987
but isn't saving your life
worth gambling on a long shot?

488
00:29:35,107 --> 00:29:38,892
- Dr. Hunt, I will
call security if...
- Let her answer.

489
00:29:40,128 --> 00:29:42,196
I'd like to hear the answer.

490
00:29:45,885 --> 00:29:48,451
Maybe...

491
00:29:48,553 --> 00:29:51,255
you have to be
dying to understand,

492
00:29:51,356 --> 00:29:54,324
but there's this
thing that happens...

493
00:29:55,694 --> 00:29:59,029
where death stops being scary.

494
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:03,967
What starts being scary is hope.

495
00:30:05,737 --> 00:30:07,604
'Cause it's not true.

496
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:14,944
Even if they found a
cure for cancer tomorrow...

497
00:30:16,215 --> 00:30:18,515
it's too late for me.

498
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:24,570
And hanging onto hope, it
may make you feel better...

499
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:31,245
but it just makes me feel alone.

500
00:30:38,504 --> 00:30:40,703
I don't want to die alone.

501
00:30:43,024 --> 00:30:44,791
OK?

502
00:30:51,416 --> 00:30:55,485
I am not afraid of this.

503
00:30:55,587 --> 00:30:57,003
Why are you?

504
00:30:59,774 --> 00:31:03,176
Why are you so
afraid to let me die?

505
00:31:25,767 --> 00:31:27,083
Dr. Hunt?

506
00:31:28,637 --> 00:31:31,938
The pharmacy wouldn't
take my insurance card.

507
00:31:33,208 --> 00:31:34,488
There was some problem,

508
00:31:34,543 --> 00:31:37,527
so I had to go to
a cash machine.

509
00:31:37,629 --> 00:31:41,364
And I'm running around
trying to get enough cash

510
00:31:41,466 --> 00:31:44,134
to buy the pills that
are gonna kill my wife.

511
00:31:47,122 --> 00:31:49,456
Anyway...

512
00:31:50,892 --> 00:31:52,158
here they are.

513
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:11,394
There'll be a moment...

514
00:32:13,364 --> 00:32:15,982
when she dies, her
face will relax, and...

515
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:20,453
all that pain that she
was in will be gone.

516
00:32:23,592 --> 00:32:25,725
And you will feel relief.

517
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:29,862
Relief for her, relief for you.

518
00:32:29,964 --> 00:32:33,866
You will know with
absolute certainty

519
00:32:33,968 --> 00:32:36,236
that you did the right thing.

520
00:32:42,027 --> 00:32:43,927
Just for a moment.

521
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:48,665
You gotta let me go, Owen.

522
00:32:48,767 --> 00:32:51,601
OK? You gotta let me
go, please. This hurts.

523
00:32:51,703 --> 00:32:53,053
It hurts.

524
00:32:53,855 --> 00:32:56,590
It's OK. It's OK.

525
00:32:56,692 --> 00:33:01,111
It's OK. Look at me.
OK. You gotta do it.

526
00:33:01,213 --> 00:33:03,195
You gotta do it. I
can't make you do it.

527
00:33:03,965 --> 00:33:06,566
OK. Please, it hurts.

528
00:33:06,668 --> 00:33:10,220
It hurts. It hurts, it's OK.

529
00:33:10,322 --> 00:33:15,709
It's OK. It's OK.
OK. You gotta do it.

530
00:33:40,418 --> 00:33:42,785
You have to hold
on to that moment,

531
00:33:42,888 --> 00:33:47,891
because all the rest of it
is just your own garbage.

532
00:33:57,319 --> 00:33:59,736
You'll be in physical
therapy for six months,

533
00:33:59,838 --> 00:34:03,472
but, with luck, you'll be
ready for your trip next year.

534
00:34:03,575 --> 00:34:07,410
- Pamplona, baby!
- Pamplona!

535
00:34:07,512 --> 00:34:08,861
Pamplona!

536
00:34:10,031 --> 00:34:11,798
Oh, come on.

537
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,699
He hates this stuff.

538
00:34:13,801 --> 00:34:17,220
The adrenaline, the adventure.
He does this just for you guys

539
00:34:17,322 --> 00:34:19,673
because you guys
love it, and he loves you.

540
00:34:20,642 --> 00:34:25,278
And... that's my
rant for the day.

541
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:28,231
I'm sorry. I like to see people
keep their legs. Ignore me.

542
00:34:28,333 --> 00:34:30,249
I'm starting my own business.

543
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:34,321
Keeps my blood pumping.

544
00:34:34,423 --> 00:34:37,991
I'm with Tommy.

545
00:34:40,928 --> 00:34:42,178
Sorry, Nick.

546
00:34:44,783 --> 00:34:48,901
I can't believe you guys.
I almost died jumping out

547
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:54,424
of a helicopter when I wanted
to go wine-tasting in Napa.

548
00:35:00,682 --> 00:35:01,948
Napa!

549
00:35:05,304 --> 00:35:07,838
Napa!

550
00:35:20,919 --> 00:35:24,955
Place looks different.
Something's different.

551
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:27,757
- Something I can help you with?
- You were jealous of her today.

552
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:29,793
- I'm sorry?
- Meredith.

553
00:35:29,895 --> 00:35:32,245
That's why you
stole her surgery.

554
00:35:32,347 --> 00:35:36,383
You miss the pace of back-to-back
surgeries, the adrenaline.

555
00:35:38,854 --> 00:35:40,387
Yeah, I do.

556
00:35:44,993 --> 00:35:47,433
Schedule yourself
one surgery a day.

557
00:35:47,495 --> 00:35:49,896
In the morning, early, an
hour before anyone else.

558
00:35:49,998 --> 00:35:52,293
So at the very least,
you start your day good,

559
00:35:52,317 --> 00:35:54,262
you start your day cutting.

560
00:35:54,286 --> 00:35:56,413
You don't have to
sign all the paperwork.

561
00:35:56,437 --> 00:35:58,582
Patricia is an excellent forger.

562
00:35:58,606 --> 00:36:01,235
If you eat alone in the
cafeteria, you are a sitting duck.

563
00:36:01,259 --> 00:36:02,887
You need to eat
with someone else.

564
00:36:02,911 --> 00:36:05,862
That way, people are more
likely to leave you alone.

565
00:36:09,768 --> 00:36:12,002
You can eat with me.

566
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,789
Thank you.

567
00:36:16,891 --> 00:36:19,492
<i>Living is better than dying.</i>

568
00:36:22,214 --> 00:36:23,980
<i>Until it's not.</i>

569
00:36:51,543 --> 00:36:53,309
I'm scared.

570
00:36:54,429 --> 00:36:56,229
Come here.

571
00:37:08,527 --> 00:37:13,245
<i>But even if letting a person
die is the right thing to do...</i>

572
00:37:16,267 --> 00:37:19,201
<i>it's not what
surgeons are built for.</i>

573
00:37:21,272 --> 00:37:23,940
<i>We are arrogant and competitive.</i>

574
00:37:30,048 --> 00:37:33,082
I'm sorry.

575
00:37:34,852 --> 00:37:36,653
I know you're mad at me.

576
00:37:42,777 --> 00:37:44,577
I'm not mad.

577
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:47,630
- I'm in Whoville.
- Whoville?

578
00:37:47,716 --> 00:37:49,999
Whoville.

579
00:37:54,622 --> 00:37:56,656
<i>We don't like to lose.</i>

580
00:38:01,729 --> 00:38:03,430
Um...

581
00:38:04,632 --> 00:38:06,210
This is really
hard for me to say

582
00:38:06,234 --> 00:38:10,019
'cause I really care
about you and...

583
00:38:10,122 --> 00:38:12,655
Oh, my God, you're
breaking up with me.

584
00:38:12,757 --> 00:38:15,391
Mark? Is it Mark? Are you
sleeping with Mark again?

585
00:38:15,476 --> 00:38:19,228
Are you one of those fake lesbians
having a vacation in lesbian land?

586
00:38:19,331 --> 00:38:21,297
No. Stop.

587
00:38:23,167 --> 00:38:25,502
God, it's not bad.

588
00:38:26,905 --> 00:38:29,425
This thing I have
to tell you isn't bad.

589
00:38:30,007 --> 00:38:32,642
Um... I just...

590
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:39,415
I want to have a baby.
At some point in my life.

591
00:38:40,302 --> 00:38:42,118
That's all.

592
00:38:43,287 --> 00:38:47,206
I really... I have
to have a baby.

593
00:38:48,610 --> 00:38:52,545
<i>And death feels like a loss...</i>

594
00:38:55,283 --> 00:38:56,882
<i>even when we know it's not.</i>

595
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:01,805
<i>We know it's time.</i>

596
00:39:01,907 --> 00:39:04,273
- <i>We know it's right.</i>
- Hey, there.

597
00:39:04,876 --> 00:39:07,776
- Hey.
- Come in.

598
00:39:12,667 --> 00:39:15,117
I helped my patient die today.

599
00:39:16,454 --> 00:39:19,288
You wanna talk about it?

600
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:24,276
No.

601
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:30,683
<i>We know we did
everything we could.</i>

602
00:39:40,095 --> 00:39:43,062
It's OK. You gotta do it.

603
00:39:44,365 --> 00:39:46,732
You gotta do it. I
can't make you do it.

604
00:39:47,936 --> 00:39:49,635
You gotta do it.

605
00:39:50,772 --> 00:39:52,505
OK.

606
00:41:07,665 --> 00:41:09,031
What are you...?

607
00:41:11,586 --> 00:41:13,286
I couldn't sleep.

608
00:41:15,807 --> 00:41:16,873
Are you OK?

609
00:41:16,975 --> 00:41:20,309
<i>But it's hard to
shake the feeling</i>

610
00:41:20,411 --> 00:41:22,762
<i>that you could have done more.</i>

611
00:41:22,864 --> 00:41:26,716
Yeah. I'm fine. Go back to bed.

612
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:30,703
Owen...

613
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:34,891
- What are you thinking?
- Nothing.

614
00:41:36,161 --> 00:41:37,927
Nothing.

615
00:41:39,798 --> 00:41:41,430
Go back to bed.
