1
00:00:02,569 --> 00:00:04,448
<i>Ask most surgeons why
they became surgeons</i>

2
00:00:04,472 --> 00:00:06,771
<i>and they usually tell
you the same thing:</i>

3
00:00:06,874 --> 00:00:08,690
<i>It was for the high. The rush.</i>

4
00:00:08,793 --> 00:00:10,909
<i>The thrill that comes
from cutting someone open</i>

5
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:13,111
<i>and saving their life.</i>

6
00:00:13,213 --> 00:00:14,412
<i>For me, it was different.</i>

7
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:15,881
Take care of yourself.

8
00:00:15,983 --> 00:00:17,677
<i>Maybe because I grew up
in a house with four sisters.</i>

9
00:00:17,701 --> 00:00:19,781
<i>No, definitely because
I grew up in a house</i>

10
00:00:19,837 --> 00:00:21,269
<i>with four sisters.</i>

11
00:00:21,371 --> 00:00:23,588
<i>Because it was the quiet
that drew me to surgery.</i>

12
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:26,224
- How you doing?
- Fine.

13
00:00:26,326 --> 00:00:29,628
- Did Meredith say something
to you?
- She mentioned you're down

14
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:31,947
about the merger,
lack of a Cardio God.

15
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:34,199
Your wife is dead, as soon
as her liver grows back.

16
00:00:34,301 --> 00:00:36,835
Be glad she did. That's
why I put you on my service.

17
00:00:36,937 --> 00:00:39,454
You need a God.
Neuro God, right here.

18
00:00:39,556 --> 00:00:42,574
Godly? Your entire day consists
of putting shunts in people.

19
00:00:42,676 --> 00:00:44,926
- Today, temporal lobectomy.
- Hmm.

20
00:00:45,028 --> 00:00:46,861
Our schedule for months now.

21
00:00:46,963 --> 00:00:48,308
Hospitals across the country

22
00:00:48,332 --> 00:00:50,582
have reported
substantial savings...

23
00:00:50,684 --> 00:00:53,234
- How bad is it today?
- The chief's implementing

24
00:00:53,336 --> 00:00:56,371
a computer model for scheduling
our surgeries from now on.

25
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:58,574
Something about
efficiency and progress.

26
00:00:58,676 --> 00:01:01,943
To make sure this was the right
decision, I have enlisted one of our own

27
00:01:02,063 --> 00:01:05,914
to do a trial run for the
last month. Dr. Sloan?

28
00:01:06,016 --> 00:01:08,666
I know what you're all
thinking. "It's a machine.

29
00:01:08,768 --> 00:01:11,303
It doesn't know me,
doesn't know what I like."

30
00:01:11,388 --> 00:01:13,755
But after using this new
system for the past month,

31
00:01:13,857 --> 00:01:16,086
I gotta say, people,
I'm a convert.

32
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:19,578
This computer knows
me better than I know me.

33
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,163
Chief, this thing's rearranged
my schedule for the week.

34
00:01:22,283 --> 00:01:24,716
I mean, haven't we had
enough change here already?

35
00:01:24,818 --> 00:01:27,138
Change is good, everyone.

36
00:01:27,988 --> 00:01:30,205
Embrace it.

37
00:01:30,307 --> 00:01:34,576
You two need to stop
bickering. It's unattractive.

38
00:01:34,678 --> 00:01:38,547
<i>The operating room is
a quiet place. Peaceful.</i>

39
00:01:38,649 --> 00:01:40,632
<i>It has to be in order
for us to stay alert,</i>

40
00:01:40,734 --> 00:01:42,134
<i>anticipate complications.</i>

41
00:01:42,236 --> 00:01:44,953
- Your ass is in my way.
- I was in the OR all night

42
00:01:45,055 --> 00:01:47,356
sewing a hang glider's
intestines together.

43
00:01:47,458 --> 00:01:49,575
- I'm kinda sore.
- I kinda don't care.

44
00:01:49,677 --> 00:01:51,543
Move.

45
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:53,862
Hey. I just got a call
from Swender's office.

46
00:01:53,964 --> 00:01:56,581
Izzie has an IL-2
treatment this week

47
00:01:56,683 --> 00:01:57,977
that she hasn't
called back to confirm.

48
00:01:58,001 --> 00:02:01,886
- And?
- And...

49
00:02:01,988 --> 00:02:04,822
she's your wife. Who could die.

50
00:02:04,924 --> 00:02:08,844
She'll show up. She's a crappy
wife, but she's not an idiot.

51
00:02:08,946 --> 00:02:12,113
OK, well, it's Thursday
at 10:00. So you know.

52
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:17,219
Don't worry, being
ditched by cancer wife

53
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:20,555
won't change my mind.
You're still a douche.

54
00:02:24,178 --> 00:02:25,788
<i>When you stand in the OR,</i>

55
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:28,480
<i>your patient open on the table,</i>

56
00:02:28,582 --> 00:02:33,385
<i>all the world's noise, all the
worry that it brings, disappears.</i>

57
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:34,727
Dr. Shepherd?

58
00:02:34,755 --> 00:02:36,922
Isaac, if you don't stop
calling me Dr. Shepherd,

59
00:02:37,024 --> 00:02:39,791
- I'm gonna have to cut you off.
- Right, forgot. Derek.

60
00:02:39,894 --> 00:02:41,810
- Thanks.
- I have the scans.

61
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:44,024
- I didn't order any.
- They're for consult.

62
00:02:44,048 --> 00:02:46,643
- But I can come back
if you're busy.
- No, it's OK.

63
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:49,017
<i>A calm settles over you...</i>

64
00:02:49,119 --> 00:02:51,135
<i>time passing without thought.</i>

65
00:02:51,238 --> 00:02:55,223
<i>For that moment, you
feel completely at peace.</i>

66
00:02:57,394 --> 00:03:00,562
It's a tumor in the spinal cord.
Possibly a hemangioblastoma.

67
00:03:00,664 --> 00:03:04,132
- You've seen them before?
- Not this big.

68
00:03:04,234 --> 00:03:06,835
You see how the tumor's
worked its way up the spine?

69
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:09,871
- It's taken over
the blood supply.
- Hmm.

70
00:03:09,974 --> 00:03:13,274
Perfect tumor. Do you know
if the patient has leg function?

71
00:03:13,376 --> 00:03:15,209
- Yes.
- Incredible.

72
00:03:15,311 --> 00:03:18,996
He shouldn't be walking,
should be paralyzed. Dead.

73
00:03:20,734 --> 00:03:23,535
You'd have to operate
quickly to take the tumor out?

74
00:03:23,637 --> 00:03:25,571
I'd love to operate
on this. But no.

75
00:03:25,673 --> 00:03:27,906
You'd have to cut the
cord, paralyze the patient,

76
00:03:28,008 --> 00:03:31,310
to kill the tumor. Who's
the doctor on this one?

77
00:03:32,613 --> 00:03:36,447
- You.
- I'm sorry?

78
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:39,551
These are my scans.

79
00:03:39,653 --> 00:03:41,035
The tumor's mine.

80
00:03:41,922 --> 00:03:43,705
I'd like you to take it out.

81
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:45,607
I'd like you to try.

82
00:03:54,918 --> 00:03:57,552
One doctor said it was bad
circulation, a pinched nerve.

83
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:59,904
When the pain started
to interfere with work,

84
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:01,907
I decided to run
an MRI on myself.

85
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:04,354
Isaac, had I known
this was your scan,

86
00:04:04,378 --> 00:04:06,911
- I wouldn't...
- I have been to every doctor,
Derek.

87
00:04:07,013 --> 00:04:08,647
Every time, it's the same thing.

88
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:11,817
They look at the tumor and
they're defeated. But not you.

89
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:13,368
You were inspired.

90
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:16,538
That's why I know I was
right to come and work here.

91
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:20,659
- I needed to meet you.
- You got a job here to meet me?

92
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:23,428
I have researched every
neurosurgeon in this country.

93
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:26,030
I know their statistics, I know
who wins the most prizes.

94
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:30,368
But I also know... who
takes the most risks.

95
00:04:30,471 --> 00:04:32,070
That's you.

96
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:36,424
Isaac, I know you believe
I can take this tumor out.

97
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:39,511
I wish I could. But
this surgery will kill you.

98
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:42,130
Take the scans, look them over.

99
00:04:42,232 --> 00:04:45,767
But stop your mind before
the part where it gets to "No".

100
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:50,104
Think "yes," yes?

101
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:53,608
Shepherd, I've been paging
you. Shunt patient, OR Two.

102
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,544
Screw the shunt,
let's operate on that.

103
00:04:58,031 --> 00:05:00,148
You know what
this is about, right?

104
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,732
You're no longer
Daddy's favorite,

105
00:05:01,835 --> 00:05:05,052
so you've gone in search of a
crazy-ass tumor to get his love back.

106
00:05:05,154 --> 00:05:06,855
Actually, it's about my patient.

107
00:05:06,957 --> 00:05:09,424
Haven't made up my
mind yet. I'm just looking.

108
00:05:09,526 --> 00:05:12,460
- Isaac has a cord tumor?
- It's awesome, look.

109
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,674
Awesome in a bad way.

110
00:05:14,698 --> 00:05:16,710
It's eaten five
levels of his spine.

111
00:05:16,734 --> 00:05:19,968
Wait, you're not seriously
considering trying to take it out?

112
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:22,804
Of course he is! He's Shepherd.

113
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:24,517
It's a bad case of
telephone, right?

114
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:27,058
Isaac's got a bone spur
or herniated disc not a...

115
00:05:28,462 --> 00:05:31,262
He diagnosed an osteosarcoma
case for me a month ago.

116
00:05:31,365 --> 00:05:32,542
I thought it was a shadow,

117
00:05:32,566 --> 00:05:34,611
but it was a tiny
lesion on an x-ray.

118
00:05:34,635 --> 00:05:36,901
That says more about
you than it does him.

119
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:39,837
I'm sorry. Do you even
know who Isaac is?

120
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:43,274
- No idea.
- What's everyone...?

121
00:05:43,377 --> 00:05:44,775
A spinal tumor?

122
00:05:44,861 --> 00:05:47,912
I read about a case at Mayo
where the surgery took 17 hours.

123
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:50,295
The head surgeon had
four rotating assistants,

124
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,261
one of whom just
administered fluids.

125
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:54,497
You know what, don't try to
Lexopedia your way on this.

126
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:55,754
This is my tumor.

127
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:57,199
What happened to
the patient at Mayo?

128
00:05:57,223 --> 00:05:59,857
He died. That's why
it only took 17 hours.

129
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:02,710
Isaac has an inoperable tumor?

130
00:06:02,812 --> 00:06:04,874
- It's Isaac's tumor?
- OK, yeah, boo-hoo. OK?

131
00:06:04,898 --> 00:06:07,082
- Who says it's inoperable?
- Cristina.

132
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:14,122
Come on, it's all
the way up to T2.

133
00:06:14,224 --> 00:06:16,141
You need three
or four assistants...

134
00:06:16,243 --> 00:06:18,660
Why aren't you all
at your surgeries?

135
00:06:18,762 --> 00:06:20,895
Go, get to your ORs.

136
00:06:20,998 --> 00:06:23,498
Don't screw with my
schedule on day one.

137
00:06:36,814 --> 00:06:42,200
- I haven't made a decision.
- No rush. I'm a patient man.

138
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:50,275
Everyone said you'd found
the great white of tumors,

139
00:06:50,377 --> 00:06:52,555
but I just had to
see it for myself.

140
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:54,362
And now that you have?

141
00:06:54,464 --> 00:06:57,298
You want my fellow
attending answer

142
00:06:57,401 --> 00:06:58,428
or my fellow surgeon answer?

143
00:06:58,452 --> 00:07:01,536
Fellow surgeon.

144
00:07:01,638 --> 00:07:04,172
This tumor is dangerous,

145
00:07:04,274 --> 00:07:09,060
complicated, smart, beautiful.

146
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:12,196
This tumor is the reason I got
into medicine in the first place.

147
00:07:12,298 --> 00:07:16,001
To successfully take out this
tumor would be an achievement

148
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:18,837
you could hang your hat
on for the rest of your career.

149
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:21,823
You could retire on this tumor.

150
00:07:21,925 --> 00:07:25,026
I wouldn't go
near it. It's a beast.

151
00:07:25,128 --> 00:07:27,578
It's a malpractice
suit waiting to happen.

152
00:07:27,681 --> 00:07:29,698
Even if we could get
his insurance to cover it.

153
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,045
Did I mention he
was an employee?

154
00:07:32,069 --> 00:07:34,269
Our pro bono budget can't
cover high-risk surgeries

155
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:35,803
for every employee.

156
00:07:35,905 --> 00:07:38,290
- We're not a charity.
- What happened to you?

157
00:07:39,493 --> 00:07:40,770
- Excuse me?
- There was a time

158
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:42,321
you'd have convinced
me to do this.

159
00:07:42,345 --> 00:07:44,946
Now, your first instinct is no?

160
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:46,525
- What happened to you?
- You came to me

161
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:48,616
as chief of surgery,
and I said no.

162
00:07:48,719 --> 00:07:52,287
As for my medical
opinion, it is still no.

163
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:54,083
There is such a thing
as an inoperable tumor.

164
00:07:54,107 --> 00:07:56,853
- What if it's not? I get in there...
- There is no way!

165
00:07:56,877 --> 00:07:59,377
Anything other than cutting
the cord would kill this man!

166
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,546
How many times
you want me to say it?

167
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:04,783
You're not operating
on an inoperable tumor!

168
00:08:07,587 --> 00:08:11,339
It's a tough job, Derek.
You sure you still want it?

169
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:18,095
So what did you do?

170
00:08:19,549 --> 00:08:24,552
I scheduled the surgery.
I'm taking out the tumor.

171
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:34,996
Microsurgery is about precision.

172
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:38,115
The microscope changes
perspective radically.

173
00:08:38,218 --> 00:08:40,652
Hand-eye coordination
can be learned,

174
00:08:40,754 --> 00:08:42,187
but right now, I need naturals.

175
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:46,257
Each one of you will get
a chance to guide this pen

176
00:08:46,343 --> 00:08:48,392
through the hole in the cup,

177
00:08:48,494 --> 00:08:50,578
making a mark closest
to the president's nose

178
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:53,665
and doesn't hit the side
of the cup gets to scrub in.

179
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:58,152
Who wants to go first?

180
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:02,690
Take your time.

181
00:09:17,407 --> 00:09:19,256
Oh, wow.

182
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:20,903
- Do-over?
- No do-overs.

183
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:24,078
- Way to go, Two.
- - Concentrate, take your time.

184
00:09:31,271 --> 00:09:32,887
Next. Here you go.

185
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:36,191
Just take your time,
we've got nothing but time.

186
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:43,615
No, next. Somebody,
please. Well off the mark.

187
00:09:46,219 --> 00:09:47,669
How'd you get into this program?

188
00:09:47,771 --> 00:09:51,222
Mr. Confident.

189
00:09:55,145 --> 00:09:58,045
Next. Next. Next. Next.
Next. Disappointed.

190
00:09:58,147 --> 00:09:59,781
So disappointed.

191
00:09:59,883 --> 00:10:01,783
Ooh... Here we go.

192
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,477
Nicely done.

193
00:10:12,562 --> 00:10:14,929
Somebody improves
on that, I'll be out of a job.

194
00:10:15,032 --> 00:10:17,231
Well, guess you might
need to retire then.

195
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:19,200
OK.

196
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:30,328
OK.

197
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:35,316
Dr. Avery, you'll
be scrubbing in.

198
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:46,794
I'll check and see what
they have available.

199
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:49,730
Word on the OR floor is
that you've gone rogue.

200
00:10:49,832 --> 00:10:52,500
I'm doing a surgery
I fully believe in.

201
00:10:52,602 --> 00:10:53,868
To piss off the chief.

202
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:55,520
When did Richard
become your BFF?

203
00:10:55,622 --> 00:10:58,142
He's not my BFF. He's the chief.

204
00:10:58,207 --> 00:11:00,008
For now.

205
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:01,376
You going rogue?

206
00:11:01,478 --> 00:11:02,927
I'm doing a
surgery I believe in.

207
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:04,929
Against the chief's
orders. He'll freak.

208
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:08,216
There's a computer schedule
saying I'm doing craniotomies all day.

209
00:11:08,318 --> 00:11:11,419
- He is not gonna find out.
- No. Shh. Don't say any more.

210
00:11:11,521 --> 00:11:13,004
'Cause me, the chief, secrets...

211
00:11:13,106 --> 00:11:16,607
Hey, I think it is bad-ass.

212
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:18,442
Come on, let's go.

213
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:21,962
Should I be offended?

214
00:11:22,064 --> 00:11:23,981
I've been trying to come
up with a good reason

215
00:11:24,084 --> 00:11:26,651
why you paged every
resident to the skills lab but me,

216
00:11:26,753 --> 00:11:28,119
me, your sister.

217
00:11:28,221 --> 00:11:30,821
- Your sister, Derek.
- You're on my service.

218
00:11:30,924 --> 00:11:32,535
Little Grey, I didn't page you

219
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:34,186
because I have
another job for you.

220
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:36,961
You gave me the idea, actually.
I need somebody in the OR

221
00:11:37,046 --> 00:11:38,857
whose gonna remind
me to take breaks.

222
00:11:38,881 --> 00:11:40,292
Bend my legs, to drink water.

223
00:11:40,316 --> 00:11:43,251
I will be your
patient, essentially.

224
00:11:43,353 --> 00:11:46,237
- You want me to be your doctor?
- If Dr. Sloan's OK with you

225
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:48,339
giving up his
service, of course.

226
00:11:48,408 --> 00:11:49,474
You love me.

227
00:11:49,576 --> 00:11:51,743
This is a once in
a lifetime tumor.

228
00:11:51,845 --> 00:11:53,611
Go get your rogue on.

229
00:11:59,352 --> 00:12:02,053
You're nervous about
being in there that long?

230
00:12:02,155 --> 00:12:05,156
- Me, too.
- What do you have
to be nervous about?

231
00:12:05,258 --> 00:12:06,652
Shepherd didn't
even let you compete.

232
00:12:06,676 --> 00:12:09,794
No, that's because he needs me

233
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:12,091
to maintain his care
while we're in there.

234
00:12:12,115 --> 00:12:15,549
- I'm his doctor, basically.
- Wow.

235
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:16,851
So you fell for that.

236
00:12:16,953 --> 00:12:20,138
It sounds... sounds
more like you're his bitch.

237
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,672
What?

238
00:12:21,775 --> 00:12:24,108
No, I'm... That is... I'm not...

239
00:12:24,194 --> 00:12:26,461
You're gonna need to
take a break eventually.

240
00:12:26,563 --> 00:12:28,763
And you're gonna
need to stretch.

241
00:12:28,865 --> 00:12:30,164
You're gonna need to pee.

242
00:12:30,266 --> 00:12:33,951
And when you do, I'll
be there to take over.

243
00:12:34,053 --> 00:12:36,270
Yeah, I don't take breaks.

244
00:12:36,372 --> 00:12:39,139
You seriously think you're
gonna last all day in there?

245
00:12:39,242 --> 00:12:40,859
I've done it before. Yeah.

246
00:12:40,961 --> 00:12:42,727
But that's because
I know to stop

247
00:12:42,829 --> 00:12:46,364
taking fluids before a long
surgery. Have fun playing nurse.

248
00:12:46,466 --> 00:12:49,066
It sounds neat.

249
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:02,046
I don't know. I think
Izzie had it right.

250
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:05,049
Get fired, run away, die.

251
00:13:05,852 --> 00:13:07,129
Mer, I'll call you back.

252
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:11,606
- Is that what I think it is?
- What? No. No, no.

253
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:13,141
No. No!

254
00:13:13,243 --> 00:13:15,527
Gimme...

255
00:13:16,446 --> 00:13:19,897
- A diaper?
- It's for the surgery.

256
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:22,316
Please don't tell
anybody about this.

257
00:13:24,754 --> 00:13:26,994
Genius. You never
have to leave the OR,

258
00:13:27,073 --> 00:13:29,301
you can hydrate all you want.

259
00:13:29,325 --> 00:13:31,843
You're mocking
me. Fine. Whatever.

260
00:13:31,945 --> 00:13:33,777
It's not like I
was gonna use it.

261
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,713
Of course you are.

262
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:38,583
This is the definition
of hardcore.

263
00:13:38,685 --> 00:13:41,152
You're like an astronaut.
This is surgery, NASA-style.

264
00:13:41,238 --> 00:13:44,322
Put it on. Right now.
I'll guard the door.

265
00:13:56,486 --> 00:13:59,254
Anybody opens their
mouth and they're fired.

266
00:13:59,356 --> 00:14:01,155
You, too.

267
00:14:02,692 --> 00:14:04,976
Dr. Shepherd, I was just
describing our new schedule

268
00:14:05,077 --> 00:14:09,664
to some of our board
members. This must be...

269
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:13,867
Mrs. Taylor. She's
undergoing a craniotomy.

270
00:14:13,969 --> 00:14:16,353
It's Mr. Taylor, chief.

271
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,308
We're still working
out a few kinks, clearly.

272
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:22,854
We should go. Keep the trains
running on time. Nice meeting you all.

273
00:14:22,878 --> 00:14:24,795
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

274
00:14:29,102 --> 00:14:32,487
Isaac, if I get in there and it
looks too dangerous to remove,

275
00:14:32,589 --> 00:14:35,790
the responsible thing
is to close you back up.

276
00:14:35,892 --> 00:14:37,775
No, don't close me up.

277
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:42,479
If you get in, if it's too
complicated, cut the cord.

278
00:14:42,581 --> 00:14:45,299
Paralyze me if you must.

279
00:14:45,401 --> 00:14:47,679
I survived a war.
Did you know that?

280
00:14:47,703 --> 00:14:50,771
I survived a war where they
put bodies into mass graves

281
00:14:50,873 --> 00:14:53,240
where there's once a playground.

282
00:14:53,343 --> 00:14:55,187
I survived the
death of my family,

283
00:14:55,211 --> 00:14:57,289
my parents, my
brothers and sisters.

284
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:59,847
Then I survived the
death of my wife and child

285
00:14:59,949 --> 00:15:03,268
when they starved to
death in a refugee camp.

286
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:05,281
I survived the
loss of my country,

287
00:15:05,305 --> 00:15:06,932
of hearing my
mother tongue spoken,

288
00:15:06,956 --> 00:15:10,808
of knowing what it feels like
to have a place to call home.

289
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:15,663
I survived. And I will
survive the loss of my legs.

290
00:15:15,765 --> 00:15:18,665
If I have to, I'll survive it.

291
00:15:18,767 --> 00:15:20,184
OK?

292
00:15:21,521 --> 00:15:24,488
- But, Derek...
- Yes?

293
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:27,325
There is always a way.

294
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:31,946
When things look like
there's no way, there's a way.

295
00:15:32,048 --> 00:15:33,781
To do the impossible.

296
00:15:33,883 --> 00:15:36,917
To survive the unsurvivable.
There's always a way.

297
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:40,888
And you... You and I
have this in common.

298
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:42,590
We're inspired.

299
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:46,644
In the face of the
impossible, we're inspired.

300
00:15:46,746 --> 00:15:49,380
So if I can offer
one piece of advice

301
00:15:49,482 --> 00:15:51,526
to the world's foremost
neuro-surgeon...

302
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:55,836
today, if you become frightened,

303
00:15:55,938 --> 00:15:59,273
instead become inspired.

304
00:16:00,276 --> 00:16:05,163
Mmm? OK, I'm ready now.

305
00:16:06,415 --> 00:16:08,348
Put me to sleep.

306
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:15,540
One hour, 13 minutes
on the surgical clock.

307
00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:17,625
The dura's opened.

308
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:20,878
Let's get our first
look at the tumor.

309
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:24,282
Wow. That's, um...

310
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:26,683
Wow.

311
00:16:26,785 --> 00:16:29,988
The vessels are more
intricate than the MRI showed.

312
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:32,873
There's no way to get to the
tumor out without rupturing one

313
00:16:32,976 --> 00:16:35,910
- and killing the cord.
- So what do we do?

314
00:16:36,012 --> 00:16:37,757
I think if we start at
T-2, I could avoid hitting

315
00:16:37,781 --> 00:16:40,748
the feeding vessels, so
maybe I should go in lower.

316
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:45,319
OK, there's less
vascularity around T7,

317
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:47,015
so that does seem better, no?

318
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:48,250
It does seem better.

319
00:16:48,274 --> 00:16:51,559
And he'd only get function
loss below the chest.

320
00:16:51,661 --> 00:16:55,045
I run the risk of rupturing
the anterior spinal artery there.

321
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:57,648
Probably. The
tumor tapers off there.

322
00:16:57,751 --> 00:16:59,199
Higher is better maybe?

323
00:16:59,301 --> 00:17:02,319
Either way I risk sending him
into hemodynamic collapse...

324
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:06,774
- He's not talking to us, is he?
- Not at all.

325
00:17:06,876 --> 00:17:10,311
T2 shows less
potential for bleeding,

326
00:17:10,413 --> 00:17:13,414
at T3 the vessels...

327
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:15,533
increased.

328
00:17:25,495 --> 00:17:28,996
- I'm sorry about the contest.
- Who told you about that?

329
00:17:29,098 --> 00:17:34,368
No one. Well, I overheard
people talking in the pit.

330
00:17:34,471 --> 00:17:36,351
- It sounded hard.
- It wasn't hard.

331
00:17:36,405 --> 00:17:37,638
It was a moment of...

332
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,456
You know what? We
don't have to discuss it.

333
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:43,460
Watching Lexie in a diaper
is punishment enough.

334
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:45,930
What? Lexie is wearing what?

335
00:17:46,032 --> 00:17:49,683
Well, that... that is a
reason you should be glad

336
00:17:49,785 --> 00:17:50,979
you're not down there.

337
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:53,921
No, that is the reason I
want to be down there.

338
00:17:54,023 --> 00:17:55,856
- What?
- Lexie gets to pee in a diaper,

339
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:58,292
- and I don't.
- You want to pee in a diaper?

340
00:17:58,394 --> 00:18:02,346
Oh, God. No. I want to
have to pee in a diaper.

341
00:18:02,448 --> 00:18:05,082
To be in a surgery
so difficult and so long

342
00:18:05,184 --> 00:18:08,652
that my only option is to
put on a diaper and pee in it.

343
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:14,475
Are they just gonna let him
stare at that thing all day?

344
00:18:14,577 --> 00:18:17,044
He hasn't made a single cut.

345
00:18:17,146 --> 00:18:20,331
If I clip the draining veins
without getting the feeders,

346
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:21,433
they'll burst...

347
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:23,718
Dr. Shepherd, I
really think it's time

348
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,081
for you to take a break.

349
00:18:25,105 --> 00:18:26,603
It's been over eight hours.

350
00:18:26,705 --> 00:18:30,390
I could go into the tumor,
here, but I might cut the artery.

351
00:18:30,492 --> 00:18:31,908
Dr. Shepherd.

352
00:18:32,011 --> 00:18:33,455
Dude, if you need
a break, take one.

353
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:35,799
I don't need one. I'm hardcore.

354
00:18:36,899 --> 00:18:39,099
- Are you wearing a diaper?
- Shut up.

355
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:40,918
At least bend your legs.

356
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,281
You can't bring
yourself to use it.

357
00:18:42,305 --> 00:18:44,655
Shut up! Shut the hell up!

358
00:18:44,757 --> 00:18:46,735
I don't need a break.
If you do, take one.

359
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:50,011
Either of you open your mouths
again, you're out of the OR.

360
00:18:54,033 --> 00:18:55,732
Bathroom break!

361
00:18:58,171 --> 00:19:00,537
- Um, Dr. Shepherd?
- What?

362
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:05,892
OK. I'm sure this is a
completely authorized surgery,

363
00:19:05,994 --> 00:19:07,673
but I thought you
might like to know

364
00:19:07,697 --> 00:19:09,180
that the chief is scheduled

365
00:19:09,282 --> 00:19:11,932
to do a surgery across
the hall in OR 3 shortly.

366
00:19:12,034 --> 00:19:16,270
So if you're planning on
doing something, anything,

367
00:19:16,372 --> 00:19:18,755
you might want to do it soon.

368
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:21,759
Thank you, Dr. Bailey.

369
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:31,235
Stevens. Izzie Stevens.

370
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,405
I know she's not at home.

371
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:36,674
You have to try her cell.

372
00:19:36,776 --> 00:19:39,109
Fine, just... No.

373
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:43,163
Tomorrow at 10:00. Don't
cancel it. She'll be there.

374
00:19:45,835 --> 00:19:47,018
What?

375
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,180
You missed the
contest this morning.

376
00:19:49,204 --> 00:19:52,289
- The one you tanked?
- Whatever.

377
00:19:52,392 --> 00:19:54,441
Shepherd has
assigned us to round

378
00:19:54,543 --> 00:19:56,427
on his cancelled craniotomies.

379
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:57,839
And, as much as I'd rather watch

380
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:00,364
his super-secret
surgery from the gallery,

381
00:20:00,466 --> 00:20:03,367
I can handle it myself
if you wanna, you know,

382
00:20:03,469 --> 00:20:04,863
deal with your Izzie stuff.

383
00:20:04,887 --> 00:20:06,665
I respected you more when
you called her cancer wife.

384
00:20:06,689 --> 00:20:09,139
- At least it was honest.
- I'm trying to be human.

385
00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:11,442
You think if I'm not there
you might get to do some

386
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:14,094
big bad neuro and tell
Shepherd you did it solo.

387
00:20:14,196 --> 00:20:16,513
Which, by the way,
makes you the douche.

388
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:19,617
You know what? I tried. Go
ahead, throw away your marriage.

389
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:23,354
- I will be rounding.
- I'll be rounding.

390
00:20:24,941 --> 00:20:27,024
This is why you don't go rogue.

391
00:20:27,126 --> 00:20:28,406
Look at him.

392
00:20:28,927 --> 00:20:30,167
He's cracked.

393
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,346
I coulda told you this
was gonna happen.

394
00:20:32,448 --> 00:20:35,299
Don't be smug. This is one
of our people's lives at stake.

395
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:36,767
This is so depressing.

396
00:20:36,869 --> 00:20:39,670
Ten hours staring into a spine,
he can't figure out what to do.

397
00:20:39,772 --> 00:20:41,889
What did you just say?

398
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:44,291
What? No, I didn't... Did I...?

399
00:20:44,394 --> 00:20:46,260
Robbins!

400
00:20:49,949 --> 00:20:51,198
Dr. Shepherd.

401
00:20:52,868 --> 00:20:56,554
Dr. Shepherd, am I to understand

402
00:20:56,656 --> 00:20:58,572
that you cancelled
your surgeries today

403
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:00,958
to operate on a
spinal cord tumor?

404
00:21:02,128 --> 00:21:03,527
Dr. Shepherd!

405
00:21:08,818 --> 00:21:11,318
The rate of infection
for this patient

406
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:13,580
is increasing every
second you keep him open,

407
00:21:13,656 --> 00:21:16,206
not to mention the thousands
of dollars you're wasting

408
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:17,875
standing here doing nothing.

409
00:21:17,977 --> 00:21:20,678
So I am demanding that
you close this man up.

410
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:23,547
Close him up and
relinquish the OR.

411
00:21:24,817 --> 00:21:26,917
Right now, Derek.

412
00:21:36,645 --> 00:21:38,312
OK.

413
00:21:40,366 --> 00:21:42,383
That's it. Let's close him up.

414
00:21:48,757 --> 00:21:51,291
No way of taking it out
without risking your life.

415
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:52,893
And to cut the cord,

416
00:21:52,995 --> 00:21:55,307
at this point, I
just won't do it.

417
00:21:55,331 --> 00:21:58,698
You're still walking, Isaac.
Let's reassess in a few months.

418
00:21:58,801 --> 00:22:02,836
I understand. You worked
hard today. You're tired.

419
00:22:07,293 --> 00:22:09,526
- I'm sorry.
- You'll try again tomorrow.

420
00:22:09,628 --> 00:22:11,495
Tomorrow?

421
00:22:13,566 --> 00:22:15,599
No, I can't try again.

422
00:22:16,869 --> 00:22:18,551
The tumor is inoperable.

423
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:22,355
I can't fix this.

424
00:22:22,457 --> 00:22:26,877
Go home. Sleep on it.
We'll talk more tomorrow.

425
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:35,635
- I don't understand.
- There's nothing to understand.

426
00:22:35,737 --> 00:22:39,339
I stood there for
ten hours, staring.

427
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:42,242
In the OR? You stood for
ten hours and did nothing?

428
00:22:42,344 --> 00:22:46,179
Yeah. OK. Let's
talk about you now.

429
00:22:47,367 --> 00:22:49,066
- How was your day?
- My day?

430
00:22:49,168 --> 00:22:50,467
Oh, my day was...

431
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:53,604
You know, I slept and I
ate an entire box of cereal.

432
00:22:53,706 --> 00:22:55,488
I left three
voicemails for Izzie.

433
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:57,291
I'm sure she won't
return any of them.

434
00:22:57,393 --> 00:23:02,012
I started and gave up on<i>
Anna Karenina</i> for the 15th time.

435
00:23:05,184 --> 00:23:07,429
- You want to talk
about the tumor.
- I do.

436
00:23:07,453 --> 00:23:09,136
Admit it, I'm a surgery junkie.

437
00:23:09,238 --> 00:23:11,567
It was more vascular
than the MRI showed.

438
00:23:11,591 --> 00:23:13,724
But you were able to
do the decompression?

439
00:23:13,826 --> 00:23:15,253
- Yes.
- But you weren't able to find

440
00:23:15,277 --> 00:23:17,089
- a plane to dissect?
- No plane, nothing.

441
00:23:17,113 --> 00:23:19,112
It was just...

442
00:23:19,215 --> 00:23:21,849
- No path. Nothing distinct.
- Why?

443
00:23:21,951 --> 00:23:24,918
Because it was just... It...

444
00:23:25,805 --> 00:23:27,220
You know what?

445
00:23:29,057 --> 00:23:30,307
What are you doing?

446
00:23:32,228 --> 00:23:33,961
Just watch and learn.

447
00:23:35,865 --> 00:23:37,932
OK.

448
00:23:38,034 --> 00:23:40,484
The tumor... is here.

449
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:42,035
Now you've completely
lost your mind.

450
00:23:42,137 --> 00:23:44,754
T7 goes all the way up to T2.

451
00:23:44,856 --> 00:23:46,506
You're drawing on the wall!

452
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:48,692
I opened the posterior
column, it's chaos.

453
00:23:48,795 --> 00:23:52,763
I didn't know what vessel
was connected to the tumor

454
00:23:52,865 --> 00:23:54,231
or to the cord.

455
00:23:54,333 --> 00:23:57,534
So what I did was...

456
00:24:00,339 --> 00:24:04,374
Start here and the anterior
spinal artery could rupture...

457
00:24:05,077 --> 00:24:06,288
cord could die.

458
00:24:06,312 --> 00:24:09,680
Here, you risk catching
the radicular artery

459
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:11,960
under the tumor, cord dies.

460
00:24:11,984 --> 00:24:13,684
But why not cut
the draining veins,

461
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:15,352
at the top, expose the arteries.

462
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:17,387
The draining
veins are very thin.

463
00:24:17,489 --> 00:24:20,858
You slip up, they burst. He
leaves my OR a quadriplegic.

464
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,561
- I might as well cut the cord.
- Which you didn't do.

465
00:24:23,663 --> 00:24:25,703
- No.
- Even though Isaac said
you could.

466
00:24:25,765 --> 00:24:27,943
You knew it would save his life.

467
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:29,750
He still has
function in his legs.

468
00:24:29,852 --> 00:24:32,052
No, but what I mean is
you didn't cut the cord.

469
00:24:32,154 --> 00:24:34,555
You stood in the
OR for ten hours.

470
00:24:34,657 --> 00:24:36,757
You knew the chief
would stop you.

471
00:24:36,859 --> 00:24:39,492
Anybody else would
have. And you didn't.

472
00:24:39,595 --> 00:24:41,995
So there must be a reason why.

473
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:13,660
This patient understands
what cutting the cord means?

474
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:16,763
The loss of function in both
legs, and possibly more?

475
00:25:16,882 --> 00:25:19,242
We have to cut the
cord to kill the tumor.

476
00:25:19,301 --> 00:25:24,771
- There's no other way.
- OK.

477
00:25:24,873 --> 00:25:29,760
That'll only take an hour
or two. You can have OR 1.

478
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:31,982
Hunt needs it right after,
so you'll have enough time.

479
00:25:32,064 --> 00:25:34,431
- Thank you.
- Good luck.

480
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,774
- We're not cutting the cord.
- We're not?

481
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:47,578
Mm-mm. The mistake I made
yesterday was that I wanted a plan.

482
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:51,248
There can be no plan. I just
have to pick a point and cut.

483
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:52,899
But what you said yesterday,

484
00:25:53,002 --> 00:25:55,085
if you cut an artery
or hit the cord...

485
00:25:55,187 --> 00:25:58,505
Isaac wants us to take the risk.

486
00:25:58,607 --> 00:26:02,293
He wants a cure.
And it's our job to try.

487
00:26:04,296 --> 00:26:06,096
See you in the OR.

488
00:26:07,533 --> 00:26:10,484
This is bad. This
is really, really bad.

489
00:26:10,586 --> 00:26:14,121
Are you kidding? No one at
Mercy West was this bad-ass.

490
00:26:14,223 --> 00:26:17,307
This isn't bad-ass! This is...

491
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:18,775
You saw him yesterday.

492
00:26:18,877 --> 00:26:20,855
He was spinning
himself in circles,

493
00:26:20,879 --> 00:26:23,664
mumbling like some crazy
psych patient. And he was mean.

494
00:26:23,765 --> 00:26:26,733
Well, he's your psych patient
now. Deal with it, diaper genie.

495
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:31,204
Hey, I wore a diaper yesterday,
yes. And I will wear one today.

496
00:26:31,306 --> 00:26:34,191
If it helps get Dr. Shepherd
through this surgery,

497
00:26:34,293 --> 00:26:35,392
I will wear a diaper.

498
00:26:35,494 --> 00:26:38,528
My diaper is awesome.
My diaper is hardcore.

499
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:41,915
You wish you had the
balls to wear my diaper.

500
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:44,902
I'm gonna wear it, and
I'm gonna wear it with pride.

501
00:26:45,003 --> 00:26:47,971
And if I have to
pee in it, oh, I'll pee.

502
00:26:48,073 --> 00:26:50,974
Because I am a
surgeon. This is America.

503
00:26:51,076 --> 00:26:53,911
And I will do what
needs to be done.

504
00:26:54,012 --> 00:26:58,064
So you can kiss my
hardcore diaper-wearing ass.

505
00:27:00,653 --> 00:27:02,819
You woke me from a
nap. This better be good.

506
00:27:02,921 --> 00:27:06,223
Napping during the day?
That's good. You'll need the rest.

507
00:27:08,577 --> 00:27:12,546
A redo retroperitoneal sarcoma?

508
00:27:12,648 --> 00:27:16,800
- That's like a 12-hour surgery.
- Fifteen, if things get ugly.

509
00:27:18,954 --> 00:27:20,738
Go! Gear up!

510
00:27:23,409 --> 00:27:26,159
- Ah! Dr. Hunt. I need a favor.
- Yeah?

511
00:27:36,204 --> 00:27:38,656
Cristina...

512
00:27:38,758 --> 00:27:42,809
- No. No!
- Shepherd needs the OR.

513
00:27:46,948 --> 00:27:48,966
I put on a diaper.

514
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:57,690
OK. I've gotten the plane.

515
00:27:57,792 --> 00:27:59,726
Ready to make our first cut.

516
00:27:59,828 --> 00:28:02,395
I heard you needed some support.

517
00:28:02,498 --> 00:28:05,465
You need people to talk
to. Experienced surgeons.

518
00:28:05,567 --> 00:28:07,727
You can't say no
because I'm in charge,

519
00:28:07,803 --> 00:28:10,363
and this is what
I'm prescribing.

520
00:28:11,973 --> 00:28:14,174
Thank you, Dr. Grey. OK.

521
00:28:15,493 --> 00:28:17,293
Let's start.

522
00:28:21,733 --> 00:28:23,633
Making the first cut.

523
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:38,231
- What, did you paralyze him?
- No.

524
00:28:38,333 --> 00:28:40,300
One vessel down.

525
00:28:40,402 --> 00:28:43,087
Settle in. We have
many more to go.

526
00:28:44,356 --> 00:28:45,688
I still hear some wheezing.

527
00:28:45,791 --> 00:28:48,458
Let's start you on another
breathing treatment.

528
00:28:56,668 --> 00:28:58,535
Dr. Karev, can I
see you for a minute?

529
00:28:58,637 --> 00:29:00,821
I'm a little busy.

530
00:29:00,923 --> 00:29:04,291
Dr. Karev, it's important.

531
00:29:06,394 --> 00:29:08,294
You need to go. It's past ten.

532
00:29:08,397 --> 00:29:10,263
You're checking your
watch every five seconds.

533
00:29:10,365 --> 00:29:11,498
You're distracted.

534
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:16,203
- Just go, I'll finish up here.
- Shut the hell up.

535
00:29:16,305 --> 00:29:17,954
Alex, come here.

536
00:29:18,056 --> 00:29:21,408
You don't know me. Why are
you all up in my face about this?

537
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:24,344
Because there's a girl sitting
down there on the third floor

538
00:29:24,446 --> 00:29:25,879
waiting for her guy.

539
00:29:25,981 --> 00:29:28,192
She doesn't want to see me, OK?

540
00:29:28,216 --> 00:29:31,117
She bailed. She didn't even
tell me to my face. She left a note.

541
00:29:31,219 --> 00:29:33,281
So stop acting like you
know anything about it

542
00:29:33,305 --> 00:29:34,716
and let me get back to my job!

543
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:39,392
- OK?
- If you're sure about that,
then fine.

544
00:29:39,494 --> 00:29:42,112
Don't go. But you better
be 100 percent sure

545
00:29:42,214 --> 00:29:43,446
she's not hoping you show up.

546
00:29:43,548 --> 00:29:47,250
Because right now, you
are making a choice. You.

547
00:29:47,352 --> 00:29:48,551
Not her.

548
00:29:50,055 --> 00:29:52,372
So you better be
at peace with that.

549
00:29:57,262 --> 00:29:59,646
I've cleared a path at T-5.

550
00:29:59,748 --> 00:30:02,231
If I continue
along this plane...

551
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:05,468
MEP losing amplitude.
What just happened?

552
00:30:05,553 --> 00:30:07,299
<i>Vessel burst, might
be connected...</i>

553
00:30:07,323 --> 00:30:10,174
- If there's not enough blood...
- I could've paralyzed
a patient.

554
00:30:10,276 --> 00:30:12,575
Suction, please. Suction.

555
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:18,899
- Oh, no.
- What? Cristina, what is it?

556
00:30:19,667 --> 00:30:22,769
Easy. Careful!

557
00:30:22,871 --> 00:30:24,687
- More suction.
- Too much blood.

558
00:30:24,773 --> 00:30:26,567
- We're losing him.
- I should've cut the cord.

559
00:30:26,591 --> 00:30:30,027
- This is too risky.
- Wait, it's back. Amplitude's up.

560
00:30:30,112 --> 00:30:32,563
The cord didn't stroke out?
You didn't paralyze him?

561
00:30:32,665 --> 00:30:34,164
Vessel was
connected to the tumor.

562
00:30:34,266 --> 00:30:35,786
We're OK.

563
00:30:35,867 --> 00:30:38,619
- Nice work, Derek.
- Thanks.

564
00:30:40,372 --> 00:30:42,200
- Dr. Shepherd?
- Take off my mask.

565
00:30:42,224 --> 00:30:45,075
- What?
- Take off my mask.

566
00:30:45,961 --> 00:30:47,760
Take off my mask!

567
00:31:01,293 --> 00:31:03,894
Get in there. Take a
breath and get back in there.

568
00:31:03,996 --> 00:31:06,716
- You can do this.
- You really should
drink something.

569
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:08,460
- I'm fine.
- You're not fine.

570
00:31:08,484 --> 00:31:11,251
You're dehydrated and
stressed. Drink something.

571
00:31:11,353 --> 00:31:13,837
- I said I'm fine.
- Drink the water.

572
00:31:14,857 --> 00:31:16,589
I said drink it!

573
00:31:41,115 --> 00:31:42,732
- Dr. Hunt?
- Chief.

574
00:31:42,834 --> 00:31:45,551
- Shouldn't you be in OR 1?
- Yes, actually,

575
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:49,555
but I swapped with Torres. She
has an emergency laparotomy.

576
00:31:49,657 --> 00:31:52,058
Dr. Torres is doing
a laparotomy?

577
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,360
What am I doing?

578
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:57,180
What? I just heard my name.

579
00:31:57,282 --> 00:32:00,099
- Chief...
- He didn't cut the cord.

580
00:32:00,202 --> 00:32:02,035
Bailey'll stop him at the door.

581
00:32:02,137 --> 00:32:03,548
She's in the OR with Shepherd.

582
00:32:03,572 --> 00:32:05,655
Then who's at the
door? Oh, my God.

583
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:07,757
- No. Whoa...
- Move.

584
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:09,220
- No.
- Dr. Robbins.

585
00:32:09,244 --> 00:32:10,910
I said no.

586
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:14,998
Dr. Shepherd is operating inside
a man's spinal cord right now.

587
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,500
Even the most minor disturbance

588
00:32:16,602 --> 00:32:19,035
could cause him to make
a mistake on that patient.

589
00:32:19,137 --> 00:32:20,504
A patient who works here

590
00:32:20,589 --> 00:32:22,867
and whose life I would like
to see Dr. Shepherd save.

591
00:32:22,891 --> 00:32:25,291
So no. You don't get to
go in there and be a bully.

592
00:32:25,394 --> 00:32:26,504
Not today, chief.

593
00:32:26,528 --> 00:32:28,428
Not on my watch.

594
00:32:39,274 --> 00:32:41,941
OK, I totally thought that
was gonna end different.

595
00:32:46,147 --> 00:32:49,666
Yeah, more like that.

596
00:32:51,854 --> 00:32:54,821
Dr. Bailey, care to fill us in?

597
00:32:54,923 --> 00:32:56,122
No, I would not.

598
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:58,774
Because anything outside
of this OR is not your concern.

599
00:32:58,877 --> 00:33:01,260
Your only concern
is this patient.

600
00:33:01,362 --> 00:33:03,213
Now, keep going.

601
00:33:07,869 --> 00:33:10,937
- Damn it.
- What is it?

602
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:13,372
I can't tell which one of
these vessels feeds the cord

603
00:33:13,475 --> 00:33:15,191
and which one feeds the tumor.

604
00:33:16,728 --> 00:33:19,795
- I have to do a blind cut.
- Like a trip wire?

605
00:33:19,898 --> 00:33:23,066
I cut the wrong one, the
entire cord strokes out.

606
00:33:24,035 --> 00:33:25,935
We'll come back to this later.

607
00:33:26,037 --> 00:33:28,805
Later? You could
finish the surgery

608
00:33:28,907 --> 00:33:31,085
only to cut the wrong one?
This will have been for nothing?

609
00:33:31,109 --> 00:33:33,876
Exactly. Thanks
for pointing that out.

610
00:33:38,917 --> 00:33:40,517
How many inches left?

611
00:33:40,552 --> 00:33:42,485
Oh, less than two.

612
00:33:42,588 --> 00:33:46,139
So if I do my math, we've
got four to five more hours.

613
00:33:46,241 --> 00:33:48,107
Crap. Oh, crap, oh, crap.

614
00:33:48,209 --> 00:33:49,887
- What is it?
- It's my hand.

615
00:33:49,911 --> 00:33:51,444
It's cramping. Dammit.

616
00:33:51,546 --> 00:33:53,363
Don't move. Don't move...

617
00:33:53,465 --> 00:33:56,215
BP's dropping!

618
00:33:56,318 --> 00:33:57,484
OK, we're touching the cord.

619
00:33:57,586 --> 00:34:00,320
If we disturb it
any more we run...

620
00:34:00,422 --> 00:34:03,407
- Pulse is down to 52.
- It's getting worse, guys.

621
00:34:03,509 --> 00:34:04,941
Easy, easy, easy, don't...

622
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:06,620
OK. It's OK. Just stay still.

623
00:34:06,644 --> 00:34:07,927
I'm gonna reach in.

624
00:34:10,098 --> 00:34:12,482
Hey, close your
eyes and breathe.

625
00:34:12,584 --> 00:34:16,202
- OK? It's just a spasm.
- BP's back up
100 over 68.

626
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:18,271
Have you had anything
to drink today, Dr. Avery?

627
00:34:18,373 --> 00:34:20,006
What?

628
00:34:20,108 --> 00:34:21,857
Muscle cramps are
a sign of dehydration.

629
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:24,627
You went without fluids so
Dr. Grey couldn't get her hands

630
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:26,812
on the retractor,
isn't that right?

631
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:30,550
Yeah.

632
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:35,205
Sorry.

633
00:34:35,307 --> 00:34:36,773
Sorry.

634
00:34:36,875 --> 00:34:39,793
Don't apologize. Just step
aside. Dr. Grey, take over.

635
00:34:43,365 --> 00:34:46,016
Easy.

636
00:34:46,118 --> 00:34:48,218
- Good. OK.
- Easy.

637
00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:56,793
Hmm. A or B? Dr. Grey?

638
00:34:56,895 --> 00:34:59,529
- A or B?
- You're done?

639
00:34:59,631 --> 00:35:01,764
- You got it all out?
- Except for the blind cut.

640
00:35:01,866 --> 00:35:04,401
Just have to pick one
and we're good to go.

641
00:35:04,502 --> 00:35:06,853
A or B?

642
00:35:06,955 --> 00:35:10,156
- You're kidding.
- You're stalling. Dr. Avery?

643
00:35:12,293 --> 00:35:14,210
I don't like to gamble.

644
00:35:14,312 --> 00:35:15,762
Dr. Sloan?

645
00:35:15,864 --> 00:35:18,014
So you can blame it on
me for the rest of your life?

646
00:35:18,117 --> 00:35:19,583
This is all you.

647
00:35:19,685 --> 00:35:22,752
Right. My call. Great.

648
00:35:34,032 --> 00:35:35,709
He's deciding which one to cut.

649
00:35:35,733 --> 00:35:36,961
Guessing which one.

650
00:35:36,985 --> 00:35:38,495
No logical way
to make that call.

651
00:35:38,519 --> 00:35:39,669
I can't look. I...

652
00:35:39,771 --> 00:35:41,937
Oh, my God, Mer,
this is so good.

653
00:35:46,061 --> 00:35:50,029
<i>Eeny, meeny, miney, moe,
catch a tiger by its toe...</i>

654
00:35:50,131 --> 00:35:52,365
Are you playing Eeny
Meeny Miney Moe?

655
00:35:52,467 --> 00:35:54,329
- Yeah.
- No.

656
00:35:54,353 --> 00:35:57,103
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's a bad idea?

657
00:35:57,205 --> 00:35:59,656
We'll see.

658
00:36:03,812 --> 00:36:05,778
OK.

659
00:36:09,784 --> 00:36:11,350
OK.

660
00:36:12,787 --> 00:36:15,688
<i>Ask most surgeons why
they became surgeons.</i>

661
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:18,157
<i>They usually tell
you the same thing.</i>

662
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:22,695
<i>The high, the rush,
the thrill of the cut.</i>

663
00:36:22,797 --> 00:36:25,264
<i>For me, it was the quiet.</i>

664
00:36:25,366 --> 00:36:29,152
- Come on, Shepherd.
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

665
00:36:29,838 --> 00:36:31,487
Please don't be wrong.

666
00:36:32,357 --> 00:36:33,557
OK...

667
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,376
He cut! He made the cut!

668
00:36:37,478 --> 00:36:40,096
Cristina, was it the right one?

669
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:41,747
<i>Cristina!</i>

670
00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:44,334
Tell me! Cristina!

671
00:36:51,409 --> 00:36:54,860
Oh, no. No.

672
00:36:56,248 --> 00:36:59,349
Oh, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no...

673
00:36:59,451 --> 00:37:01,918
- No...
- Isaac, what is it?

674
00:37:02,554 --> 00:37:04,221
I can...

675
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:07,874
I can move my toes.

676
00:37:10,828 --> 00:37:13,162
It didn't work, did it?

677
00:37:13,264 --> 00:37:15,999
- You couldn't do it.
- No, no.

678
00:37:16,101 --> 00:37:19,552
We got the tumor. It's gone.

679
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:24,507
- But I can move my toes.
- Because we saved the cord.

680
00:37:24,609 --> 00:37:27,143
It was a successful surgery.

681
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:29,762
You're gonna be fine.

682
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:37,787
I knew you would try, but...

683
00:37:39,825 --> 00:37:42,709
- I'm going to be OK?
- Yes.

684
00:37:42,811 --> 00:37:45,461
I'm actually going to be OK?

685
00:37:45,563 --> 00:37:47,464
Yes.

686
00:37:51,603 --> 00:37:54,571
You're a good man, Derek.

687
00:37:54,673 --> 00:37:58,107
You're a very good man.

688
00:37:58,209 --> 00:38:01,828
<i>Peace isn't a permanent state.</i>

689
00:38:03,765 --> 00:38:06,165
<i>It exists in moments.</i>

690
00:38:06,267 --> 00:38:07,800
<i>Fleeting.</i>

691
00:38:08,937 --> 00:38:11,971
<i>Gone before we
even knew it was there.</i>

692
00:38:14,642 --> 00:38:16,854
Shepherd finished the surgery.

693
00:38:16,878 --> 00:38:21,163
And I took care of all the
pre-ops, so we're good to go.

694
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:27,336
She didn't show.

695
00:38:33,628 --> 00:38:36,963
She can't be this stupid.

696
00:38:39,835 --> 00:38:44,637
I mean, it saved her life.
The IL-2 saved her life.

697
00:38:45,473 --> 00:38:47,807
And she didn't show up.

698
00:38:48,877 --> 00:38:50,309
She...

699
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:53,512
She didn't show up.

700
00:38:56,618 --> 00:39:00,319
Who doesn't show up?

701
00:39:08,463 --> 00:39:11,414
<i>We can experience
it at any time.</i>

702
00:39:11,516 --> 00:39:14,083
<i>In a stranger's act of kindness.</i>

703
00:39:16,638 --> 00:39:20,673
<i>A task that requires
complete focus.</i>

704
00:39:31,886 --> 00:39:34,236
You're standing too close.

705
00:39:35,106 --> 00:39:38,308
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

706
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:41,377
- I'll show you.
- You?

707
00:39:41,479 --> 00:39:43,596
Look at your hands.
They're hams.

708
00:39:43,698 --> 00:39:45,482
Mine are tiny little geniuses.

709
00:39:45,584 --> 00:39:48,818
It's not about the hands.
It's about the body.

710
00:39:49,621 --> 00:39:51,638
You know, your stance.

711
00:39:52,874 --> 00:39:55,674
Tilt your head. Here.

712
00:39:57,078 --> 00:39:58,677
Then...

713
00:39:58,779 --> 00:40:00,713
- Your eye-line.
- Uh-huh.

714
00:40:02,984 --> 00:40:05,985
You stand too close, you
throw everything else off.

715
00:40:21,435 --> 00:40:24,637
Good. Go again.

716
00:40:28,126 --> 00:40:31,795
<i>Or simply the comfort
of an old routine.</i>

717
00:40:45,009 --> 00:40:47,777
We can't keep
doing this, Richard.

718
00:40:49,564 --> 00:40:52,432
I'm tired of fighting you.

719
00:40:52,534 --> 00:40:55,067
Let's try and put this
behind us and move on.

720
00:40:55,169 --> 00:40:57,921
I can, if you can.

721
00:41:03,962 --> 00:41:05,511
You're fired.

722
00:41:06,281 --> 00:41:07,947
Immediately.

723
00:41:08,849 --> 00:41:11,369
Get the hell out of my hospital.

724
00:41:15,457 --> 00:41:16,772
Go home.

725
00:41:19,127 --> 00:41:21,060
Sleep on it.

726
00:41:22,029 --> 00:41:23,829
We'll talk more tomorrow.

727
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:31,104
<i>Every day, we all experience
these moments of peace.</i>

728
00:41:31,206 --> 00:41:33,940
<i>The trick is to know
when they're happening</i>

729
00:41:34,058 --> 00:41:36,309
<i>so that we can embrace them.</i>

730
00:41:36,411 --> 00:41:38,444
<i>Live in them.</i>

731
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:49,939
OK. So I've heard almost
everything from Cristina,

732
00:41:50,041 --> 00:41:53,810
but I want to hear your version.
So start from the beginning

733
00:41:53,912 --> 00:41:55,979
and tell me everything.

734
00:41:59,718 --> 00:42:03,102
Derek? Derek?

735
00:42:04,406 --> 00:42:07,456
<i>And finally, let them go.</i>
