1
00:00:04,088 --> 00:00:06,822
<i>We begin life with
few obligations.</i>

2
00:00:06,924 --> 00:00:09,991
<i>Good morning, Seattle.
Welcome to this fine morning...</i>

3
00:00:10,093 --> 00:00:12,244
<i>We pledge
allegiance to the flag.</i>

4
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:15,463
<i>We swear to return
our library books.</i>

5
00:00:15,565 --> 00:00:18,050
<i>But as we get
older, we take vows,</i>

6
00:00:18,135 --> 00:00:21,219
<i>we make promises, we get
burdened by commitments.</i>

7
00:00:21,321 --> 00:00:22,637
<i>To do no harm.</i>

8
00:00:22,739 --> 00:00:25,690
<i>To tell the truth
and nothing but.</i>

9
00:00:25,792 --> 00:00:28,827
<i>To love and cherish
till death do us part.</i>

10
00:00:30,814 --> 00:00:32,880
<i>So we just keep
running up the tab</i>

11
00:00:32,983 --> 00:00:35,250
<i>until we owe
everything to everybody</i>

12
00:00:35,352 --> 00:00:37,085
<i>and suddenly think...</i>

13
00:00:37,187 --> 00:00:38,503
<i>What the...?</i>

14
00:00:42,276 --> 00:00:45,494
Sure it was not a deer? There
are a lot of deer. Bucks can get big.

15
00:00:45,596 --> 00:00:48,497
I think I know the difference
between a bear and a deer!

16
00:00:48,599 --> 00:00:51,600
- Rest, ice and elevate, OK?
- You know how I got to the car?

17
00:00:51,702 --> 00:00:54,769
I had to throw a raw
steak and run for my life.

18
00:00:54,872 --> 00:00:58,473
That was a ten-ounce filet. I've
been marinating it for three days.

19
00:00:58,575 --> 00:01:01,376
- We have to move!
- Where?

20
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:03,039
We barely make 30 grand a year.

21
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:05,780
Who knows if we'll have
a job after the merger.

22
00:01:05,882 --> 00:01:08,311
- We could move back
to Meredith's.
- You did not say that.

23
00:01:08,335 --> 00:01:11,019
- Why not?!
- Because we're married now.

24
00:01:11,121 --> 00:01:14,539
This is how it's supposed to
be, you and me, out in the world,

25
00:01:14,641 --> 00:01:16,391
making a life for ourselves.

26
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:20,979
Besides, don't you enjoy waking
up to the fresh air and birds chirping?

27
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:23,297
You know what I
enjoy? I enjoy plumbing.

28
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,700
I enjoy plumbing so much!

29
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:32,591
It's not that I don't love
it at Mer's. I do. It's just...

30
00:01:32,692 --> 00:01:34,592
I can't move backwards, Alex.

31
00:01:34,694 --> 00:01:36,561
Not after everything that's...

32
00:01:38,548 --> 00:01:42,867
I just need to keep
moving forward, OK?

33
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:46,438
- Thank you.
- I know it hasn't
exactly been easy

34
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:49,040
around here the past few weeks.

35
00:01:49,143 --> 00:01:50,759
And I know you want answers.

36
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:52,877
But I'm afraid I
don't have them.

37
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:54,213
Not just yet.

38
00:01:54,315 --> 00:01:56,515
He brought us here to
make himself feel good.

39
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,817
At least he sprung
for good Danish.

40
00:01:58,902 --> 00:02:00,669
Know how many
got fired for that?

41
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:02,988
The Mercy West staff
will arrive in three days.

42
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:06,725
When they do, more
cutbacks and more layoffs,

43
00:02:06,827 --> 00:02:10,762
and I need each and every one
of you to step up and be leaders.

44
00:02:10,864 --> 00:02:13,414
And when I can answer
your questions, I will.

45
00:02:13,516 --> 00:02:16,079
Will we be losing
more scrub nurses?

46
00:02:16,103 --> 00:02:20,071
If you'd like to make an appointment
to talk about your concerns, we can.

47
00:02:20,174 --> 00:02:22,241
What about my burn center?

48
00:02:23,677 --> 00:02:27,195
You were right.
Excellent Danish.

49
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:31,249
What about robotics...?

50
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:33,051
- Anything?
- Nope.

51
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,570
There was a papillary
muscle rupture in the CCU,

52
00:02:35,672 --> 00:02:37,552
but he died before
they got him to OR.

53
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:40,058
Crap! I need surgeries now.

54
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,560
I barely hit 100 hours
in the OR this month.

55
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:46,214
And you know they're gonna keep
the residents with the most hours.

56
00:02:48,485 --> 00:02:51,602
- What do ya got?
- Um, diabetic ulcer.

57
00:02:51,705 --> 00:02:54,673
- Down to the bone?
- No.

58
00:02:54,775 --> 00:02:58,276
I'm done. Finished.
Expired meat.

59
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:00,996
- You're freaking out.
- You haven't been kicked off

60
00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:04,833
two services in a month. I couldn't
get into an OR if I was bleeding to death.

61
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:07,069
- You got anything good?
- I'm scrubbing in

62
00:03:07,171 --> 00:03:10,739
on an optic glioma later on
with Derek. I've never seen one.

63
00:03:15,829 --> 00:03:17,011
What are you doing?

64
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:19,614
Just making sure everything's
running smoothly here.

65
00:03:19,716 --> 00:03:21,716
And... it is.

66
00:03:21,818 --> 00:03:24,869
- Kudos.
- No, no, no. Uh-uh. Ho! No.

67
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:28,251
I am on Hunt's service. Anything
that turns surgical here is mine.

68
00:03:28,275 --> 00:03:30,942
You don't need hours. You
spent six months in the OR.

69
00:03:31,045 --> 00:03:34,312
- Unconscious on a table doesn't count.
- - Meredith?

70
00:03:34,414 --> 00:03:36,915
Hey. His neighbor said
he wasn't getting his mail.

71
00:03:37,017 --> 00:03:38,550
Meredith...

72
00:03:38,652 --> 00:03:42,404
I heard... you got
married on a sticker.

73
00:03:42,506 --> 00:03:44,756
- That's great.
- We should go,

74
00:03:44,858 --> 00:03:47,659
- so you can have family time.
- I don't know what's wrong.

75
00:03:47,761 --> 00:03:50,940
Did you pick him up off the floor
of a bar? That might be a clue.

76
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:53,048
Meredith... I'm not...

77
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,500
I haven't been
drinking. I swear...

78
00:04:03,393 --> 00:04:05,610
Now that could be surgical.

79
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:16,538
OK. Make sure his fluids
are running wide open,

80
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,507
let's get that blood hung.

81
00:04:18,608 --> 00:04:20,875
- Got FFP here.
- What about factor seven?

82
00:04:20,977 --> 00:04:23,194
- Check his INR?
- Hang 50 mikes of octreotide.

83
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:26,131
- Got it.
- Shouldn't we check for renal failure?

84
00:04:26,216 --> 00:04:28,733
- Move. I need to lavage him.
- I need to put this up.

85
00:04:28,836 --> 00:04:31,269
OK, hey! Pause! Way
too many people here.

86
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:34,356
Karev, get that orogastric
tube in. The rest of you, out.

87
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:36,658
No, wait a minute.
I'm in emergency!

88
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,527
This is emergent!

89
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:42,264
He made amends. He's not drunk.

90
00:04:48,355 --> 00:04:52,023
All right, Irving, I'm taking off the
growth. Let me know if you feel pain.

91
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,758
He gets so many of these.

92
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,478
Have the nursing home
examine him when they bathe him.

93
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:59,981
- I bathe myself.
- Of course you do, Irving.

94
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:02,283
He could fall in the tub.

95
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:05,203
Why don't you two go
get me a cup of coffee?

96
00:05:05,306 --> 00:05:07,038
You already had a cup, Dad.

97
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,818
Too much isn't
good for your ticker.

98
00:05:08,842 --> 00:05:10,442
He can have decaf, Tommy.

99
00:05:10,544 --> 00:05:14,329
We'll go get you a
nice cup of decaf.

100
00:05:14,431 --> 00:05:15,697
Thank you, sweetie.

101
00:05:15,799 --> 00:05:19,551
You know, I'm not
demented. I'm just old.

102
00:05:21,221 --> 00:05:22,937
Come on.

103
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:26,274
- All right, uh,
Mr. Waller, all done.
- All done.

104
00:05:26,376 --> 00:05:30,512
There might be a little redness,
but it should heal up nicely. Got it?

105
00:05:30,614 --> 00:05:34,816
I've had those skin things
for 30 years. I'm not worried.

106
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:39,136
What I'm really
here for is AMS 700.

107
00:05:39,239 --> 00:05:43,175
- The... penile implant?
- Yeah.

108
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:47,312
Usually, the first step in treating
erectile dysfunction is drug therapy.

109
00:05:47,414 --> 00:05:49,781
If you're having symptoms, I
can write you a prescription.

110
00:05:49,883 --> 00:05:52,768
No, no. I took
those pills years ago.

111
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:55,437
They never even
gave me a lift-off.

112
00:05:55,539 --> 00:05:58,023
And then my wife
died and I gave up.

113
00:05:58,125 --> 00:06:03,044
But I'm seeing this new
gal from the east wing.

114
00:06:03,146 --> 00:06:06,047
She's a younger woman,

115
00:06:06,149 --> 00:06:08,683
and I don't want to disappoint.

116
00:06:10,788 --> 00:06:14,656
I understand. But it is
a surgical procedure,

117
00:06:14,758 --> 00:06:18,426
so there is a question
of safety, given your age.

118
00:06:18,528 --> 00:06:21,562
My age? It's always my age.

119
00:06:23,099 --> 00:06:25,433
Ah, the golden years.

120
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:27,975
Let me tell you about
the golden years, Doc.

121
00:06:28,038 --> 00:06:30,905
There's just got
to be more to life

122
00:06:31,007 --> 00:06:34,442
than eating pudding
and watching<i> CSI.</i>

123
00:06:34,544 --> 00:06:39,314
Come on. Can you give an
old man a working Johnson?

124
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,972
Did I tell you how
great your hair looks?

125
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:49,808
It's all just short and...

126
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:54,713
- edgy.
- You are really tweaking out.

127
00:06:54,815 --> 00:06:56,709
How long has it
been since you've cut?

128
00:06:56,733 --> 00:06:58,783
- Over a week.
- Ooh.

129
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:01,052
I have something,
if you're interested.

130
00:07:01,155 --> 00:07:02,187
Well, I'm interested.

131
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:03,955
An MVC came in a while back.

132
00:07:04,057 --> 00:07:06,307
During his work-up, I found
an abdominal sarcoma.

133
00:07:06,409 --> 00:07:09,360
I've been following
his recurrences.

134
00:07:09,463 --> 00:07:11,490
He came back today
with his third one.

135
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:14,081
Wondered if you could
scrub in, if you feel ready.

136
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:15,612
- I'm ready.
- I'm ready.

137
00:07:15,636 --> 00:07:17,335
He's in pre-op.

138
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:23,825
- You know I need a surgery.
- I don't play favorites.

139
00:07:23,927 --> 00:07:27,061
People are afraid to work with
Stevens, like she's gonna break.

140
00:07:27,163 --> 00:07:29,280
It's not right. She's
a good surgeon.

141
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:31,065
She has a way with patients.

142
00:07:32,068 --> 00:07:34,035
- A light touch.
- You want nice?

143
00:07:34,137 --> 00:07:36,470
- I can be nice to a dying husk.
- Yeah.

144
00:07:36,573 --> 00:07:38,406
Not a light touch.

145
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,809
My dad's dead.

146
00:07:41,911 --> 00:07:45,096
At first I thought he was drunk,
then he started puking blood.

147
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:47,682
Puking blood and
disorientation usually means...

148
00:07:47,784 --> 00:07:50,785
- End-stage liver failure.
- He's probably dead by now.

149
00:07:50,888 --> 00:07:53,621
Or he needs a transplant. I
hope he's not a candidate.

150
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:56,374
That means he'd be in
the hospital for months.

151
00:07:57,478 --> 00:07:59,578
Uh, Mer?

152
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,415
- He needs a transplant,
doesn't he?
- Yeah.

153
00:08:08,388 --> 00:08:11,222
You've got end-stage cirrhosis.

154
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:12,858
We can treat the symptoms,

155
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,960
but the only thing that can
save your life is a transplant.

156
00:08:16,062 --> 00:08:18,864
- How did it happen this fast?
- He bathed it in gin.

157
00:08:18,966 --> 00:08:21,311
- Alex.
- Your friend's right.

158
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:23,618
Except for the gin. I
was a Scotch man.

159
00:08:25,155 --> 00:08:27,622
What's the next step here?

160
00:08:27,724 --> 00:08:29,324
Do I get on a list?

161
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:33,178
Um, Thatcher, the transplant
board has a rule here.

162
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,224
An alcoholic has to
be sober at least a year

163
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:37,616
before he qualifies
for a donor liver.

164
00:08:37,718 --> 00:08:40,252
I'm only 90 days.

165
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:46,174
I'll do it.

166
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:48,994
I'll do it today. I'll go
get tested right now.

167
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:51,396
- Lexie...
- They just take a piece.

168
00:08:51,498 --> 00:08:52,864
My liver will regenerate.

169
00:08:52,966 --> 00:08:55,833
I can't ask you to do
something like that. It's...

170
00:08:55,936 --> 00:08:58,820
- It's major surgery.
- You're not asking.

171
00:08:58,922 --> 00:09:00,705
You're my dad.

172
00:09:00,807 --> 00:09:03,541
You want a kidney? I'll
throw in one of those, too.

173
00:09:07,681 --> 00:09:10,398
One more time. You be the
chief, cranky and in a bad mood,

174
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,180
- and I'm Callie
asking for her job.
- You are Callie.

175
00:09:13,253 --> 00:09:15,954
- Right, so it works.
- You said that yesterday.

176
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:18,690
And the day before. And
the day before the day before.

177
00:09:18,792 --> 00:09:21,859
- Are you gonna do this?
- It's not easy to ask
for your job back

178
00:09:21,962 --> 00:09:25,763
after you told your boss to go
screw himself. It's humiliating.

179
00:09:25,865 --> 00:09:28,199
- You're not gonna do it.
- What is the point?

180
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:32,003
He fired me once. He's not gonna
hire me back now because of the merger.

181
00:09:32,105 --> 00:09:34,656
Whatever. Maybe being
a surgeon's overrated.

182
00:09:34,758 --> 00:09:36,124
I'd be happy
doing lots of things.

183
00:09:36,226 --> 00:09:38,592
I could open a day-care.
Babies are cute.

184
00:09:38,695 --> 00:09:40,095
Ew.

185
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:42,347
- That one spit.
- Calliope, I don't want you

186
00:09:42,449 --> 00:09:44,210
to have to move to
Cleveland to be a surgeon.

187
00:09:44,234 --> 00:09:46,501
OK. I'm gonna do it.

188
00:09:46,602 --> 00:09:49,337
Oh.

189
00:09:49,439 --> 00:09:52,140
Later? I will come back later.

190
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:58,513
My girlfriend's moving
to Cleveland. Yep. Yep.

191
00:10:00,067 --> 00:10:02,333
Look at you, coming
in on your day off.

192
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:04,585
- Trying to get into the OR?
- Yeah.

193
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:07,288
I'm giving my dad a piece of
my liver. End-stage liver disease.

194
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:11,225
- Needs my liver,
giving him some.
- Whoa, wait a minute.

195
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:14,028
- What is your problem?
- My problem is you don't jump

196
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:15,964
into this without
thinking about it.

197
00:10:16,066 --> 00:10:17,565
Take a couple
of days. We'll talk.

198
00:10:17,667 --> 00:10:20,835
- What is there to talk about?
- Major, life-threatening
surgery.

199
00:10:20,937 --> 00:10:23,855
- My dad needs
a transplant, Mark.
- I get that, but...

200
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:26,107
No, I don't think
you get it at all.

201
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:28,109
You know what I don't get?

202
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:31,012
We're together.
We live together.

203
00:10:31,114 --> 00:10:33,631
We need to decide
these things together.

204
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:36,067
You can't go under the
knife and leave me a note.

205
00:10:36,169 --> 00:10:39,153
- I would've paged you.
- I am your boyfriend, Grey.

206
00:10:39,255 --> 00:10:41,740
He's my dad!

207
00:10:44,611 --> 00:10:46,093
OK, little pinch.

208
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:55,036
I cannot get this
stupid thing to work.

209
00:10:55,138 --> 00:10:57,705
Try knocking it on something.

210
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:02,860
- <i>Excuse me...</i>
- Insider trick.

211
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:04,506
What other tricks do you know?

212
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:06,542
Stay away from the lime Jell-O.

213
00:11:06,566 --> 00:11:09,634
If you want good meds, tell them
you have a headache, not stomach.

214
00:11:09,736 --> 00:11:11,752
If your arm hurts
from needle pokes,

215
00:11:11,872 --> 00:11:14,172
tell them you want
anesthetic cream. It numbs it.

216
00:11:14,274 --> 00:11:18,009
- You've done this before.
- Stage four melanoma.

217
00:11:18,111 --> 00:11:20,644
Mrs. Helsby, I'm gonna
have to give him a rectal exam.

218
00:11:20,747 --> 00:11:24,315
- You may want
to leave the room.
- No, I'm not his wife.

219
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:26,884
What's that saying,
they won't buy the cow

220
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:28,869
if you give 'em
the milk for free?

221
00:11:28,972 --> 00:11:31,756
We're working on
eight years of free milk.

222
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:34,325
I was gonna propose last
year, but I got distracted

223
00:11:34,428 --> 00:11:35,938
by this little thing
called cancer.

224
00:11:35,962 --> 00:11:38,340
You got the best
excuse in the book.

225
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:40,198
Nice.

226
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:45,036
The ring's at home in
the mouthguard container.

227
00:11:45,138 --> 00:11:48,222
I'm just waiting for
the right moment.

228
00:11:48,325 --> 00:11:53,278
What we'd do is we'd surgically
place the silicone implant into the penis,

229
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,880
and when the pump is
squeezed before intercourse...

230
00:11:55,966 --> 00:11:58,666
- Where does the pump go?
- In the scrotum.

231
00:11:58,768 --> 00:12:00,818
So to pump it up, I
squeeze the jewels?

232
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,354
Dad, Dad... This...

233
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:06,657
It's ridiculous!
You're 82 years old!

234
00:12:06,742 --> 00:12:08,926
So? I shouldn't have a sex life?

235
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:11,929
Go on, Doc. You're just
getting to the good part.

236
00:12:12,031 --> 00:12:16,134
No, listen to me. This is major
surgery. They have to cut your...

237
00:12:16,219 --> 00:12:18,853
They cut you open,
Dad. You could bleed or...

238
00:12:18,972 --> 00:12:22,357
You wanna die? Over an erection?

239
00:12:22,459 --> 00:12:24,625
Wars have been fought
over an erection, son.

240
00:12:24,727 --> 00:12:28,012
Irving, I'm sure
that a thing like this

241
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:29,414
isn't covered by Medicare.

242
00:12:29,516 --> 00:12:31,348
You don't want to
use your savings.

243
00:12:31,451 --> 00:12:33,362
You want to help
Janey pay for college.

244
00:12:33,386 --> 00:12:36,437
Sweetheart, I love Janey,

245
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:40,274
but let's stop pretending
she's going to college.

246
00:12:40,376 --> 00:12:43,211
She's pretty, but
she's not too sharp.

247
00:12:43,313 --> 00:12:46,280
- Dad!
- Tom, this is my money.

248
00:12:46,382 --> 00:12:47,676
This is the way I
want to spend it!

249
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,651
Your mother and I
saved our entire lives

250
00:12:50,754 --> 00:12:53,404
for what she called a rainy day.

251
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:56,123
And then she died before
we could spend one cent.

252
00:12:56,225 --> 00:12:59,743
Your mother would be proud I'm
finally doing something nice for myself.

253
00:12:59,846 --> 00:13:02,413
Mom would be proud
you're getting a penis pump?!

254
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:04,732
OK, we have to run some tests.

255
00:13:04,834 --> 00:13:07,819
We might not know if
the surgery's an option.

256
00:13:07,921 --> 00:13:11,805
So why don't we
all just calm down.

257
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:14,208
Start from there.

258
00:13:22,452 --> 00:13:26,304
- Hey. What you looking for?
- Excuse me?

259
00:13:26,406 --> 00:13:28,139
I couldn't help but notice

260
00:13:28,241 --> 00:13:31,109
you have no resident on your
decompressive laminectomy.

261
00:13:31,211 --> 00:13:33,928
Today's your lucky
day 'cause I'm available.

262
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:38,616
Yang, right? I heard you
were hardcore into cardio.

263
00:13:38,718 --> 00:13:41,802
I can be hardcore
into anything you want.

264
00:13:47,594 --> 00:13:49,594
Are you whoring
yourself out for surgeries?

265
00:13:49,629 --> 00:13:51,774
Oh, shut up. You
forced me into it.

266
00:13:51,798 --> 00:13:54,198
Biology? It's crap. Utter crap.

267
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:58,102
DNA, RNA, it doesn't
make someone your family.

268
00:13:58,204 --> 00:14:00,938
- It does, actually.
- He needs a liver transplant.

269
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,341
Lexie volunteered, like
she got asked for a dollar bill.

270
00:14:03,443 --> 00:14:05,838
I left the room.
He's not my father.

271
00:14:05,862 --> 00:14:07,556
Your dad needs a transplant?

272
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:10,097
Maybe not. Maybe
he's dead this time.

273
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,089
Damn it. It's worse
than I thought.

274
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:21,392
The scarring's completely
fused his organs together.

275
00:14:21,494 --> 00:14:24,579
God, looks like somebody
poured a bottle of glue down there.

276
00:14:24,681 --> 00:14:26,547
How do we fix it?

277
00:14:28,551 --> 00:14:30,384
We don't.

278
00:14:31,987 --> 00:14:34,388
If we could get to the
cancer, we get clean margins.

279
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:38,343
With this many adhesions, the
risk of tumor rupture, it's too high.

280
00:14:38,445 --> 00:14:41,512
We cut into him again, we're
doing more harm than good.

281
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:42,480
Maybe if we...

282
00:14:42,582 --> 00:14:44,822
We have to know
when to say when.

283
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,452
I'm saying when.

284
00:14:53,409 --> 00:14:55,960
- Is he dead?
- No.

285
00:14:56,546 --> 00:14:58,062
Oh.

286
00:14:58,164 --> 00:15:01,065
Look, we rushed Dr. Grey's
labs. She wasn't a match.

287
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:02,984
Oh!

288
00:15:03,086 --> 00:15:05,486
OK. Um...

289
00:15:05,588 --> 00:15:07,989
What about Holly?

290
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:11,358
- Molly? Our sister?
- Yeah.

291
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:14,696
She lives on an Army base
with her husband in Bahrain.

292
00:15:14,798 --> 00:15:17,832
Plus, she has a history of
DVT. So she can't be a donor.

293
00:15:17,934 --> 00:15:19,167
Oh.

294
00:15:19,269 --> 00:15:22,236
Meredith, we didn't
call you here to...

295
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:25,990
We thought you should know before
we go in and tell him, just in case.

296
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:28,392
Right. Right, no, thank you

297
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:30,144
for keeping me in
the loop. Thank you.

298
00:15:30,246 --> 00:15:33,848
I, um, have to go prep
for my surgery now. OK.

299
00:15:43,175 --> 00:15:46,393
Why are we eating lunch in a
room full of diseased organs?

300
00:15:46,495 --> 00:15:49,546
We are hiding from
Lexie and her big, sad,

301
00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:50,692
"I love my daddy" eyes.

302
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:53,167
Because I can't take it anymore.

303
00:15:53,269 --> 00:15:56,287
Is Little Grey not a match? Oh,
damn! There goes my transplant.

304
00:15:56,389 --> 00:15:57,849
Nice try. It was my transplant.

305
00:15:57,873 --> 00:15:59,573
Are you gonna get tested?

306
00:15:59,675 --> 00:16:01,659
No, I barely know the guy.

307
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:04,495
Might as well get tested.

308
00:16:04,581 --> 00:16:06,225
You could regret
it if you don't.

309
00:16:06,249 --> 00:16:08,348
He's a deadbeat, but he
gave you the ultimate gift.

310
00:16:08,451 --> 00:16:11,202
- The gift of life.
- You guys are sick.

311
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:13,788
You really are sick.
Don't listen to them, Mer.

312
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:16,257
- They just want a surgery.
- Mama needs to cut.

313
00:16:16,359 --> 00:16:20,261
Babe, you got some dirt
on your neck. Right there.

314
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:24,015
That's not dirt. That's a tick.

315
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:25,633
Ew.

316
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:27,345
- Get it off me.
- Is that a tick?

317
00:16:27,369 --> 00:16:29,003
- It is a tick.
- A tick.

318
00:16:29,105 --> 00:16:30,683
- It's swollen.
- Get if off me.

319
00:16:30,707 --> 00:16:33,741
- It's having lunch, too.
- Get it off me! Get it off me
now!

320
00:16:33,843 --> 00:16:36,043
Tick, tick!
Somebody, take it off!

321
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:39,279
The kids think
this is all vanity.

322
00:16:39,381 --> 00:16:42,082
But I really need
this surgery, Doc.

323
00:16:42,184 --> 00:16:45,319
If she loves you, she'll
understand if you can't...

324
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:48,372
perform. Cuddling is nice, too.

325
00:16:48,474 --> 00:16:51,291
You're just a kid, Doc.
You won't understand.

326
00:16:51,393 --> 00:16:53,861
But one day you're
gonna wake up,

327
00:16:53,963 --> 00:16:55,813
and all the big stuff,

328
00:16:55,915 --> 00:16:58,043
all the milestones you
been looking forward to,

329
00:16:58,067 --> 00:17:00,851
graduations, weddings,

330
00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:04,271
having kids, your grandkids,

331
00:17:04,373 --> 00:17:06,391
it's all behind you.

332
00:17:06,493 --> 00:17:08,993
It's all over.

333
00:17:09,095 --> 00:17:11,879
All you got is a
bunch of yesterdays,

334
00:17:11,981 --> 00:17:14,281
and very few tomorrows.

335
00:17:14,383 --> 00:17:16,968
I haven't wanted to
make love with a woman

336
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:19,553
since Sylvie died 20 years ago.

337
00:17:19,655 --> 00:17:22,223
And then one night,

338
00:17:22,325 --> 00:17:26,861
one night they sat me
down at the bingo table

339
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:31,365
- with Marion.
- And you just knew?

340
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:34,551
She's my tomorrow.

341
00:17:43,596 --> 00:17:46,681
- He's still sleeping.
- Good. He needs his rest.

342
00:17:46,783 --> 00:17:48,482
Dr. Bailey, I...

343
00:17:48,584 --> 00:17:51,052
I was wondering
if you could... lie.

344
00:17:51,154 --> 00:17:54,072
If you could lie to
the transplant board

345
00:17:54,174 --> 00:17:56,407
and tell them he's
been sober for a year.

346
00:17:56,509 --> 00:17:58,709
They trust you,
they'll listen to you.

347
00:17:58,761 --> 00:18:01,201
- Maybe he can
get on the list...
- Dr. Grey,

348
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:04,848
I have 15 other patients all
waiting for liver transplants.

349
00:18:04,951 --> 00:18:08,319
Fifteen people in an
untenable situation,

350
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:10,988
none of whom drank
themselves into it.

351
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:14,308
So, no, I will not lie. Not
for you. Not for anyone.

352
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:17,828
Do you have any other
questions I can answer?

353
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,732
How would you like it?

354
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:23,667
Things crawling all over you,

355
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:27,271
stupid squirrels having a
party all night on your roof.

356
00:18:27,373 --> 00:18:29,256
What the hell are
they doing up there?

357
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:32,225
- Applying betadine to the area.
- I don't know how to deal.

358
00:18:32,327 --> 00:18:35,062
I don't camp! My parents
were lounge lizards.

359
00:18:35,164 --> 00:18:36,363
I was raised in a bar.

360
00:18:36,465 --> 00:18:37,648
Extracting the arachnid.

361
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,367
And there's no plumbing.

362
00:18:39,468 --> 00:18:43,270
I mean, the toilet empties into
a bucket underneath the trailer.

363
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:46,506
A crap bucket! And Izzie's
all, "Marriage is an adventure,

364
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:49,260
just the two of us,
exploring the wild."

365
00:18:49,362 --> 00:18:51,962
I married freaking
Lewis & Clark!

366
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:54,214
- I guess I'm done.
- That's it.

367
00:18:54,316 --> 00:18:59,136
I'm telling her. We're moving
back to Meredith's. I'm done.

368
00:18:59,238 --> 00:19:01,822
- You can't do that.
- Why not?

369
00:19:01,925 --> 00:19:03,557
Because that's not how it works.

370
00:19:03,659 --> 00:19:05,843
She's just been through
hell. She's not OK yet.

371
00:19:05,945 --> 00:19:07,194
Just give her one, Alex.

372
00:19:07,296 --> 00:19:10,564
Since when did you become
a marriage counselor?

373
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:12,149
I guess when you
save someone's life,

374
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:14,685
you kind of want it not to suck.

375
00:19:17,006 --> 00:19:20,307
I hate when people who don't
live here say Seattle weather sucks.

376
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:23,544
- Those people suck.
- Ooh, I wanted to
show you something.

377
00:19:23,646 --> 00:19:26,280
- I made a list.
- Hm? You made a list?

378
00:19:26,382 --> 00:19:27,648
Yeah, to read to the chief.

379
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:30,751
Fifty reasons why he should
hire me as an attending. OK.

380
00:19:30,853 --> 00:19:33,737
Number one: I built a man's
bones out of titanium rods.

381
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:36,940
Two: what I lack in experience,
I make up for in raw talent.

382
00:19:37,043 --> 00:19:40,444
Three: I can go seven hours in
the OR without taking a pee break.

383
00:19:40,546 --> 00:19:43,998
- Four... What are you doing?
- I'm going back to the
hospital.

384
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:47,451
Uh, this is important!

385
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:52,756
I lost my favorite scrub
nurse yesterday, Anne.

386
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:56,009
She's a single mother,
supporting three kids,

387
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:57,812
and now she's out of a job.

388
00:19:57,914 --> 00:20:00,080
This morning, a
ten-month-old hemorrhaged

389
00:20:00,182 --> 00:20:01,226
while I was in her chest

390
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:04,318
and I didn't have my
favorite scrub nurse.

391
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:07,354
I had to actually look up
and ask for a mesh wrap

392
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:09,668
because the new
nurse didn't know me.

393
00:20:09,692 --> 00:20:12,526
Anne knew all my moves
before I even made them.

394
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:16,630
And it felt terrible to be
in the OR without her.

395
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:21,513
I was looking forward to 30
minutes in the park with my girlfriend.

396
00:20:21,537 --> 00:20:25,355
'Cause this merger thing?
It's important to all of us.

397
00:20:26,676 --> 00:20:28,492
Sorry. I've been...

398
00:20:28,595 --> 00:20:30,360
Just...

399
00:20:30,462 --> 00:20:32,697
Sorry.

400
00:20:36,135 --> 00:20:38,903
He'll say yes or he'll say no.

401
00:20:39,005 --> 00:20:41,739
And then we'll know.

402
00:20:43,543 --> 00:20:45,676
OK.

403
00:20:51,868 --> 00:20:54,134
- This is our optic glioma guy?
- Mm-hmm.

404
00:20:54,237 --> 00:20:57,554
You sure you're up for this?
There'll be others, I promise.

405
00:20:57,656 --> 00:21:01,358
Yeah, you know, everyone is
looking at me like I owe him something.

406
00:21:01,461 --> 00:21:04,795
- But he's still
the bad guy here.
- You don't owe him anything.

407
00:21:09,185 --> 00:21:10,584
I...

408
00:21:13,506 --> 00:21:15,556
So I'm gonna be fired.

409
00:21:15,658 --> 00:21:17,858
I've done a lot of really
dumb things today,

410
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:20,444
including pulling
your medical files.

411
00:21:20,546 --> 00:21:23,380
- Lexie...
- Just listen.

412
00:21:23,482 --> 00:21:24,848
I didn't want to do this.

413
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:28,435
I didn't want to have to
come to you for anything.

414
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:31,705
So I thought if I looked
up your blood type

415
00:21:31,807 --> 00:21:34,892
and it was the wrong
one, then that would be it.

416
00:21:34,994 --> 00:21:37,327
Then I could just
stop thinking about it.

417
00:21:37,413 --> 00:21:41,899
But I can't, because
you have his blood.

418
00:21:42,001 --> 00:21:44,651
I know that he's not your dad.

419
00:21:44,754 --> 00:21:46,737
I know that he was
never there for you,

420
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:50,374
and I would never ask
you to give him anything.

421
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:53,811
He doesn't deserve a
thing from you. He doesn't.

422
00:21:53,913 --> 00:21:55,912
But he's...

423
00:21:56,014 --> 00:21:59,416
He's gonna die, Meredith.

424
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:02,786
And so I'm asking you
to give something to me.

425
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:05,523
I'm asking...

426
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:09,560
I'm asking you to
give me my dad.

427
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:13,631
Because as crappy
as he was to you,

428
00:22:13,732 --> 00:22:16,149
he was wonderful to me.

429
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:20,787
He never missed a
single dance recital.

430
00:22:20,889 --> 00:22:23,357
He was there at my
fifth grade graduation.

431
00:22:23,459 --> 00:22:25,192
And what is that?
That's not even real.

432
00:22:25,294 --> 00:22:29,880
I know he's not
your dad. I know that.

433
00:22:31,384 --> 00:22:33,284
But somehow...

434
00:22:34,287 --> 00:22:37,671
you have his blood and I don't.

435
00:22:38,641 --> 00:22:40,507
So I'm asking you,

436
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:43,410
give me my dad.

437
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:08,853
Meredith.

438
00:23:10,022 --> 00:23:12,055
We found a match.

439
00:23:13,325 --> 00:23:15,993
- What?
- We found a match. A donor liver.

440
00:23:16,095 --> 00:23:19,296
So we're gonna schedule
the surgery for tonight.

441
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:20,764
Uh, that's terrific.

442
00:23:20,866 --> 00:23:26,187
But I thought I wasn't
eligible for the transplant list.

443
00:23:26,289 --> 00:23:28,488
It's not from the list, it's me.

444
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:34,427
I got tested, and my
crossmatch was negative,

445
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:36,374
which means we're
an ideal match.

446
00:23:36,398 --> 00:23:37,731
So I'm gonna go get admitted

447
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:41,017
- and we'll do this.
- Mer...

448
00:23:43,689 --> 00:23:46,890
I'm a drunk, Meredith.

449
00:23:46,992 --> 00:23:50,627
I did this. I put
myself in this bed.

450
00:23:50,729 --> 00:23:52,129
I broke me.

451
00:23:54,016 --> 00:23:58,052
I can't... I won't let you
put me back together.

452
00:23:59,137 --> 00:24:01,888
I put you through enough.

453
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:05,008
It's a generous offer. I can't.

454
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:07,695
I can't accept it.

455
00:24:11,767 --> 00:24:14,618
I'm sorry, but there's gotta
be something else you can do.

456
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,239
He's 31. We just
bought a condo together.

457
00:24:18,341 --> 00:24:21,659
- We just rescued a puppy!
- Ange, it's gonna be OK.

458
00:24:21,761 --> 00:24:25,963
No, it's not! They're just
sending you home to...

459
00:24:26,065 --> 00:24:30,450
What kind of doctors are you?!
You're supposed to do something!

460
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:32,953
They're doing
everything they can.

461
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:36,590
Dr. Hunt's given us extra time,
time that we never would've had.

462
00:24:36,692 --> 00:24:39,276
Dr. Hunt, can I...?

463
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:42,862
Excuse me.

464
00:24:45,935 --> 00:24:48,318
- Try cytoreductive surgery.
- It won't work.

465
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:52,255
We have to be able to remove the
tumor and with these adhesions, you can't.

466
00:24:52,357 --> 00:24:55,158
Ball-tipped electrosurgery
helps get around the adhesions.

467
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:59,446
His cancer's incurable. I'm not gonna
put him through another painful surgery.

468
00:24:59,548 --> 00:25:01,877
- His survival rate's
13 percent.
- I had five.

469
00:25:01,901 --> 00:25:03,984
- Stevens...
- I had a five percent chance

470
00:25:04,086 --> 00:25:07,171
of survival. I have incurable
cancer, but I am living with it.

471
00:25:07,273 --> 00:25:09,673
The reason I am, the
reason I'm standing here

472
00:25:09,775 --> 00:25:12,476
is because no one ever
said, "We've done everything".

473
00:25:12,578 --> 00:25:15,329
I'm alive right now because
people fought for me.

474
00:25:15,431 --> 00:25:17,397
Cristina fought for me.

475
00:25:17,499 --> 00:25:20,967
He deserves the chance to fight.
If he doesn't want it, I will shut up.

476
00:25:21,069 --> 00:25:23,704
But he deserves a chance!

477
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:31,695
You know what? I'm
good. I'm off the hook.

478
00:25:31,797 --> 00:25:33,680
I did what I was supposed to do.

479
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:35,342
I offered. Mother
Teresa would be proud.

480
00:25:35,418 --> 00:25:37,818
- You gotta go back in there.
- And do what?

481
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:40,954
- Cry and call him Daddy?
- He's the sick one, OK?

482
00:25:41,073 --> 00:25:43,974
He's sick, you're not. Go
back in. Say what you gotta say

483
00:25:44,076 --> 00:25:46,610
- to make him take it.
- Alex, I tried.

484
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:48,612
Try again.

485
00:26:26,702 --> 00:26:30,320
His BP is normal, his
bloodwork is pristine.

486
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:32,606
He appears to have the
heart of a 50-year-old.

487
00:26:32,708 --> 00:26:36,961
- So, what does that mean?
- It means he's cleared
for surgery.

488
00:26:37,063 --> 00:26:39,096
You're gonna go
through with this?

489
00:26:39,197 --> 00:26:40,580
You bet I am, champ.

490
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:43,217
Well, it's your money.
We can't stop you.

491
00:26:43,319 --> 00:26:48,055
But Irene and I have talked it
over. We've decided if you do this,

492
00:26:48,157 --> 00:26:51,374
we're taking you out of the home
and moving you back in with us.

493
00:26:51,477 --> 00:26:54,979
I don't want to move in with
you. I'm happy where I am.

494
00:26:55,081 --> 00:26:58,715
That place is causing you
to make irrational decisions:

495
00:26:58,817 --> 00:27:02,202
going after a younger woman,
sneaking into her room at night.

496
00:27:02,304 --> 00:27:04,737
It's not appropriate
for a man your age.

497
00:27:04,839 --> 00:27:07,557
Now there's an extra
twin in Janey's room.

498
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:10,293
She'll be thrilled to spend
more time with Grandpa.

499
00:27:10,395 --> 00:27:12,412
Come on!

500
00:27:12,514 --> 00:27:15,449
- It's just an erection!
- Excuse me?

501
00:27:15,551 --> 00:27:17,400
All the guy wants is a woody!

502
00:27:17,502 --> 00:27:19,542
God forbid you get to be his age

503
00:27:19,571 --> 00:27:21,699
and your kids won't
let you have one.

504
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:24,791
He's your father. He's taken
care of you your entire lives,

505
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:27,510
given you everything, and
now he needs something

506
00:27:27,612 --> 00:27:29,112
and you throw that in his face?

507
00:27:29,214 --> 00:27:31,392
Know how many people
would jump at the chance

508
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:34,751
to give back to their parents,
who would sacrifice everything

509
00:27:34,853 --> 00:27:37,120
without blinking?

510
00:27:39,091 --> 00:27:41,692
There's nothing wrong with
dating a younger woman.

511
00:27:41,794 --> 00:27:45,345
It keeps you young. That's
my professional opinion.

512
00:27:55,057 --> 00:27:57,424
Does the chief always...

513
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:01,094
pay such attention
to his patients,

514
00:28:01,196 --> 00:28:06,032
or just the ones whose
wives he had an affair with?

515
00:28:09,572 --> 00:28:11,271
Sorry.

516
00:28:12,741 --> 00:28:15,309
How did I do this to myself?

517
00:28:16,912 --> 00:28:18,178
How did I end up here?

518
00:28:30,025 --> 00:28:33,626
You woke up every morning

519
00:28:33,728 --> 00:28:36,029
and you promised
yourself that last night

520
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:37,764
would be your last drink.

521
00:28:37,866 --> 00:28:40,551
And you made it...

522
00:28:41,653 --> 00:28:43,787
till 9:00am.

523
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:46,623
Or noon.

524
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:49,760
Some days, till cocktail hour.

525
00:28:51,063 --> 00:28:53,329
And you were so
pleased with yourself

526
00:28:53,432 --> 00:28:58,735
that you rewarded
yourself... with a drink.

527
00:28:58,837 --> 00:29:03,139
You convinced yourself again
that it would be the only one.

528
00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:06,944
You have a disease, Thatcher.

529
00:29:07,046 --> 00:29:11,264
When you're in
it, you can't stop.

530
00:29:12,867 --> 00:29:15,034
You can't undo what you did.

531
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:20,106
But Meredith is offering
you a second chance, man.

532
00:29:20,208 --> 00:29:22,676
You need that liver.

533
00:29:22,778 --> 00:29:25,195
You need it now.

534
00:29:27,499 --> 00:29:30,250
If you want to live.

535
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:34,004
I took her childhood.

536
00:29:35,307 --> 00:29:37,975
I can't take any more from her.

537
00:29:39,845 --> 00:29:41,678
You...

538
00:29:44,683 --> 00:29:47,400
You better take
care of my girls.

539
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:50,754
You owe me at least that.

540
00:29:55,410 --> 00:29:58,945
Hey. My stromal cancer patient?
We're going for the surgery.

541
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:01,025
We're gonna do
it. Hunt listened.

542
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:02,949
- That's great.
- I'm gonna go scrub in.

543
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:05,135
Hey, are you OK?

544
00:30:05,237 --> 00:30:07,688
I'm sorry about
the whole tick thing.

545
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:12,242
I'm fine. It's... It's a small
price to pay for fresh air.

546
00:30:12,327 --> 00:30:14,227
OK.

547
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,013
You're welcome.

548
00:30:37,953 --> 00:30:40,503
You used to pour my
cereal in the morning.

549
00:30:40,605 --> 00:30:43,356
That's it. That's all I
remember about you.

550
00:30:43,458 --> 00:30:48,078
You're not my father. You're just
the guy who used to pour my cereal.

551
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:51,698
And if you die, it probably
won't change my life that much.

552
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,833
But it will change hers.

553
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:56,169
If you die, it will break her.

554
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:58,550
And I'm not gonna
let you do that.

555
00:30:58,574 --> 00:31:01,225
I don't know what it's
like to have a father.

556
00:31:01,327 --> 00:31:05,262
But I do know what it's like
to have a sister. And it's good.

557
00:31:07,632 --> 00:31:10,684
And if we can get through
this, the door will be open for us

558
00:31:10,786 --> 00:31:12,385
to get to know each other.

559
00:31:13,221 --> 00:31:15,004
The door's open.

560
00:31:27,319 --> 00:31:30,553
So before intercourse, he
squeezes the pump in his scrotum.

561
00:31:30,655 --> 00:31:32,389
- Ooh!
- And...

562
00:31:32,491 --> 00:31:33,873
- Oh. Oh.
- Oh.

563
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:35,615
His age doesn't
make it high-risk?

564
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:37,870
Well, there's
always risk involved,

565
00:31:37,912 --> 00:31:41,247
but this is the most advanced
solution to his problem.

566
00:31:41,349 --> 00:31:44,801
What's high-risk? Does someone
have a risky high-tech surgery?

567
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:46,703
Cristina, I don't
think you wanna...

568
00:31:46,805 --> 00:31:49,406
I think this would be a
real challenge for Dr. Yang.

569
00:31:49,508 --> 00:31:51,803
- Do you think
she can handle it?
- Oh, I can handle it.

570
00:31:51,827 --> 00:31:55,461
- I don't think
she can handle it.
- I can handle it.

571
00:31:57,482 --> 00:31:59,533
Pre-op's in 2083.

572
00:31:59,635 --> 00:32:02,719
Thank you, Dr. Sloan.

573
00:32:02,821 --> 00:32:05,171
I'm gonna pay for that later.
But it was kind of worth it.

574
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:11,411
Beat it. Sloan wants me on this.

575
00:32:11,513 --> 00:32:14,847
OK, Mr. Waller. I'm Dr. Yang.

576
00:32:14,949 --> 00:32:18,551
I'll be taking over your pre-operative
care this evening for your

577
00:32:18,653 --> 00:32:21,388
penile implant surgery.

578
00:32:24,426 --> 00:32:27,594
- You're getting
a penile implant?
- Yes, ma'am.

579
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:31,198
That fellow, he was
just gonna shave me.

580
00:32:39,408 --> 00:32:40,707
Terrific.

581
00:32:40,809 --> 00:32:43,659
- You wanted a surgery.
- Putting a bicycle pump

582
00:32:43,761 --> 00:32:48,231
in some old man's junk is
not surgery, it's punishment.

583
00:32:48,333 --> 00:32:51,468
At least you don't have to be
laid up in bed for the next month.

584
00:32:51,569 --> 00:32:54,070
You better tell me all the
gossip about Mercy West.

585
00:32:54,172 --> 00:32:56,589
- I want all the gory details.
- Yeah, yeah.

586
00:32:59,193 --> 00:33:02,345
- Am I stupid for doing this?
- No.

587
00:33:02,447 --> 00:33:03,529
Really?

588
00:33:03,632 --> 00:33:06,950
You get to save
your dad's life tonight.

589
00:33:09,121 --> 00:33:10,771
Hey. What are you doing here?

590
00:33:10,873 --> 00:33:13,256
You didn't think I'd let
you do this by yourself?

591
00:33:13,358 --> 00:33:14,741
This is not how this works.

592
00:33:14,843 --> 00:33:16,743
Do I need to find
you something to do?

593
00:33:16,845 --> 00:33:19,779
No, I have a penis.

594
00:33:21,983 --> 00:33:24,634
I'm gonna sit by her
head. I won't say a word.

595
00:33:24,737 --> 00:33:26,953
- Shepherd, this is my OR.
- I respect that.

596
00:33:27,072 --> 00:33:30,574
But this is my wife
that you're cutting into.

597
00:33:37,132 --> 00:33:40,650
I haven't just been waiting for
the right moment to propose.

598
00:33:40,752 --> 00:33:43,086
- You've been waiting
for remission.
- Yeah.

599
00:33:43,188 --> 00:33:45,922
I didn't want to saddle her
down with a sick husband.

600
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:50,793
But now it looks like that just
might be part of the package.

601
00:33:50,895 --> 00:33:54,080
So, what the hell. I'm not
gonna waste another moment.

602
00:33:54,182 --> 00:33:56,282
You shouldn't.

603
00:33:57,469 --> 00:33:59,619
- Ready when you are.
- Ready?

604
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:22,509
I had five interns. Four of
you have been on this table.

605
00:34:22,611 --> 00:34:24,911
One of you has
cancer, one of you died.

606
00:34:25,013 --> 00:34:28,448
You better not pull
anything funny on me, Grey.

607
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:55,119
Let's see what we got here.

608
00:34:55,143 --> 00:34:58,294
Dr. Yang, the senior resident...

609
00:34:58,396 --> 00:35:01,465
should test the apparatus.
I understand if you pass.

610
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:08,221
I don't pass, Dr. Sloan. This
might be a joke to all of you,

611
00:35:08,323 --> 00:35:10,223
but I do my job.

612
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,527
Squeezing the scrotum.

613
00:35:14,829 --> 00:35:17,247
- Nice!
- Awesome.

614
00:35:31,413 --> 00:35:33,179
Liver's here.

615
00:35:39,588 --> 00:35:41,771
Make sure you keep
the bowel covered.

616
00:35:41,873 --> 00:35:44,791
I need more wet laps.

617
00:35:44,893 --> 00:35:47,293
- Uh...
- He's got some
collateral bleeding.

618
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:48,628
I need the argon beamer.

619
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:51,464
- Hang more FFPs.
- BP's dropping out!

620
00:35:53,118 --> 00:35:55,101
Sir, we can't kill this guy.

621
00:35:55,203 --> 00:35:57,369
I'm aware of that, Karev!

622
00:36:08,567 --> 00:36:11,718
If it's bad news, I
don't want to wake her.

623
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:13,486
Wake her.

624
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:19,275
Hey.

625
00:36:42,651 --> 00:36:45,818
They had a couple of months
and we just took that away.

626
00:36:47,255 --> 00:36:50,624
- I'm sorry. It's my fault.
- It's my fault!

627
00:36:50,726 --> 00:36:53,242
It was my call, and it was
the wrong call. I was wrong.

628
00:36:53,344 --> 00:36:55,464
I should have known
better. I should have...

629
00:36:57,249 --> 00:36:59,349
I should have taught better.

630
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:03,519
You see a one in a million,
and you want to believe.

631
00:37:03,621 --> 00:37:06,422
I was wrong to do the
surgery, to put you on this case.

632
00:37:06,524 --> 00:37:09,408
You weren't ready to be
here. You beat the odds.

633
00:37:09,511 --> 00:37:14,147
You were that one in a million. But you
cannot be a doctor and a patient here.

634
00:37:14,249 --> 00:37:16,116
You have to choose.

635
00:37:42,126 --> 00:37:43,376
How'd it go, Doc?

636
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:46,913
I don't think you'll
be disappointed.

637
00:37:49,034 --> 00:37:51,767
Well, well, well.
Dr. Sloan, I'd...

638
00:37:51,869 --> 00:37:56,622
I'd like you to meet my
Marion. Hello, sweets!

639
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:11,120
- Sir.
- Now is not the time, Yang.

640
00:38:11,222 --> 00:38:13,523
I have good hands.
They are fast, dexterous,

641
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:16,408
they were made to throw ties
and do complex procedures.

642
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:18,794
These hands were
made for surgery.

643
00:38:18,896 --> 00:38:21,514
They should have been
deep in a heart, saving a life.

644
00:38:21,616 --> 00:38:24,267
Instead, they removed a
tick and pumped a penis!

645
00:38:24,369 --> 00:38:28,020
- What's your point?
- My point?

646
00:38:30,892 --> 00:38:32,675
You should cut me.

647
00:38:34,029 --> 00:38:35,728
- What?
- From the program.

648
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:38,330
You have to make more
cuts, and I should go.

649
00:38:38,432 --> 00:38:41,651
If you can't give me a brilliant
cardiothoracic attending

650
00:38:41,753 --> 00:38:43,386
who is willing to teach me,

651
00:38:43,488 --> 00:38:45,554
then I can't get what I
need from this hospital.

652
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:48,958
Everyone is scared of
losing their job, and so am I.

653
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:52,795
But if I can't learn,
if I can't use my gift,

654
00:38:52,897 --> 00:38:54,530
then I...

655
00:38:54,632 --> 00:38:57,550
I guess that scares me more.

656
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:01,821
That's my point, sir.

657
00:39:07,278 --> 00:39:09,712
<i>The thing about being a surgeon,</i>

658
00:39:09,814 --> 00:39:12,248
<i>everybody wants a piece of you.</i>

659
00:39:13,368 --> 00:39:15,234
<i>We take one little oath...</i>

660
00:39:17,322 --> 00:39:20,406
The case where he kept his
mouthguard, you should open it.

661
00:39:26,031 --> 00:39:27,780
I'm very sorry for your loss.

662
00:39:29,434 --> 00:39:33,936
<i>And suddenly, we're
drowning in obligations.</i>

663
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:36,972
<i>To our patients,
to our colleagues,</i>

664
00:39:37,074 --> 00:39:39,241
<i>to medicine itself.</i>

665
00:39:42,563 --> 00:39:44,313
Chief?

666
00:39:45,217 --> 00:39:46,916
Are you OK?

667
00:39:48,436 --> 00:39:50,069
I have responsibilities.

668
00:39:50,171 --> 00:39:55,208
To make this hospital the
best medical facility it could be.

669
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:58,777
To repair what I've broken,

670
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,814
even if it was 20 years ago.

671
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:07,970
If I am now the bad guy,
if I am now the villain here,

672
00:40:08,073 --> 00:40:09,705
well...

673
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:15,210
so be it.

674
00:40:16,698 --> 00:40:19,215
This must be so hard for you.

675
00:40:26,808 --> 00:40:28,457
Thanks, Torres.

676
00:40:29,810 --> 00:40:33,146
I was gonna... I was...

677
00:40:34,015 --> 00:40:36,315
But I'm gonna go, so...

678
00:40:36,435 --> 00:40:38,518
- You take care, OK?
- Torres.

679
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:40,470
Sir?

680
00:40:40,572 --> 00:40:42,972
Go see HR tomorrow.

681
00:40:43,074 --> 00:40:48,511
Tell them you're an attending surgeon at
Seattle Grace and you want a new badge.

682
00:40:49,464 --> 00:40:52,698
And take some of
these Danish home.

683
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,767
They'll just go to waste.

684
00:41:01,275 --> 00:41:04,811
<i>So we do what any
sane person would do.</i>

685
00:41:04,913 --> 00:41:07,430
<i>We run like hell
from our promises,</i>

686
00:41:07,532 --> 00:41:09,198
<i>hoping they'll be forgotten.</i>

687
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:13,369
Oh, God!

688
00:41:15,290 --> 00:41:18,458
- A deer?
- We have to move.

689
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:25,848
<i>But sooner or later,
they always catch up.</i>

690
00:41:36,628 --> 00:41:40,212
Hey. You're awake.

691
00:41:40,315 --> 00:41:42,614
How's your pain?
Is your mouth dry?

692
00:41:42,716 --> 00:41:44,683
There's water. Are you thirsty?

693
00:41:45,853 --> 00:41:48,771
Have you been
sleeping on me all night?

694
00:41:48,873 --> 00:41:51,353
Yeah, I was moving
between you and Dad.

695
00:41:51,442 --> 00:41:55,061
- Who's doing good.
- Good. That's good.

696
00:41:55,162 --> 00:41:58,715
<i>And sometimes, you find the
obligation you dread the most...</i>

697
00:42:01,269 --> 00:42:03,018
- Lexie.
- Yeah?

698
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:07,657
- You're on my IV.
- Oh, sorry. OK.

699
00:42:07,759 --> 00:42:10,827
<i>Isn't worth running from at all.</i>
