1
00:00:02,436 --> 00:00:05,037
<i>The skin is the largest
organ in the body.</i>

2
00:00:05,139 --> 00:00:09,808
<i>It protects us,
holds us together,</i>

3
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:12,244
<i>literally lets us know
what we are feeling.</i>

4
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:14,480
Reaction, observation,
communication.

5
00:00:14,581 --> 00:00:16,248
Any questions so far?

6
00:00:17,635 --> 00:00:21,153
We're doing this because
Chief Shepherd suggests

7
00:00:21,255 --> 00:00:24,139
we brush up on our patient
sensitivity skills, that's why.

8
00:00:24,241 --> 00:00:27,575
And it just so happens this
morning was a very good time.

9
00:00:27,678 --> 00:00:30,679
Besides, half of you
were raised by wolves.

10
00:00:30,781 --> 00:00:33,665
"Reaction."

11
00:00:35,169 --> 00:00:37,286
"Keep your face impassive.

12
00:00:37,388 --> 00:00:40,105
Whether prompted by a
patient's appearance or lab results,

13
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:43,842
facial expressions of
surprise, concern, disgust, etc.,

14
00:00:43,944 --> 00:00:45,343
can be counterproductive."

15
00:00:45,445 --> 00:00:47,279
Uh, la la la la la...

16
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:49,948
"Jokes.

17
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,433
Don't make jokes about patients.

18
00:00:51,535 --> 00:00:54,736
Not in front of them,
not even in private."

19
00:00:54,838 --> 00:00:57,389
- Yang.
- What if the joke
is really funny?

20
00:00:57,491 --> 00:00:59,774
It's not. Neither was
that one. Moving on.

21
00:00:59,877 --> 00:01:02,410
We assess quickly in the
ER, and go to Radiology.

22
00:01:02,512 --> 00:01:04,858
What if he has to be admitted?
Can we get to the surgical elevator?

23
00:01:04,882 --> 00:01:06,125
What about the freight elevator?

24
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:08,016
Richard, are we set up for this?

25
00:01:08,118 --> 00:01:10,252
I mean, our tables...
Do we have enough?

26
00:01:10,354 --> 00:01:12,098
Is our equipment
gonna be strong enough?

27
00:01:12,122 --> 00:01:15,357
They're five minutes out. We'll
have to figure it out as we go.

28
00:01:16,644 --> 00:01:19,845
<i>The skin can be
soft and vulnerable,</i>

29
00:01:19,947 --> 00:01:21,529
<i>highly sensitive.</i>

30
00:01:21,631 --> 00:01:22,897
<i>Easy to break.</i>

31
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:24,243
Is that Gary Clark?

32
00:01:24,267 --> 00:01:25,745
He's filed a wrongful
death suit in his wife's case.

33
00:01:25,769 --> 00:01:27,809
- I'm being deposed today.
- Chief Shepherd? Hi.

34
00:01:27,904 --> 00:01:30,255
Whatever you're selling,
leave the samples in my office.

35
00:01:30,357 --> 00:01:31,834
I'm not a drug rep.
I'm your lawyer.

36
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:34,393
- Lauren Turner.
- Go. Don't worry. I got this.

37
00:01:34,494 --> 00:01:38,112
OK. Thank you. Dr. Shepherd,
Lauren. Follow me, please.

38
00:01:38,215 --> 00:01:41,049
"Observation."

39
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:46,438
OK. "Use reflective listening.

40
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:49,007
Repeat the patient's
feelings back to them.

41
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:51,643
'I hear that you're
concerned about the surgery.

42
00:01:51,745 --> 00:01:53,361
Let me explain the risks.'"

43
00:01:53,463 --> 00:01:56,665
"I can see you like vegetables.
After surgery, you might become one."

44
00:01:58,502 --> 00:02:02,153
"Communication.

45
00:02:02,255 --> 00:02:04,735
Don't use jargon. Use language
that the patient can understand.

46
00:02:04,825 --> 00:02:06,808
Be creative in using metaphors."

47
00:02:06,911 --> 00:02:08,154
I'm terrible with metaphors.

48
00:02:08,178 --> 00:02:10,495
- I can never come up with them.
- Why?

49
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:12,030
You're dumb as a box of hammers?

50
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:15,200
See, that's a good one. You're
an ass, but that was a good one.

51
00:02:15,285 --> 00:02:18,253
"Be clear and comprehensive.
Explain all risks and probable outcomes,

52
00:02:18,355 --> 00:02:20,299
leaving nothing out."
Question. Adamson.

53
00:02:20,323 --> 00:02:23,058
- Why are you going so fast?
- It just so happens

54
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,176
that we have an
emergent patient arriving

55
00:02:25,278 --> 00:02:27,557
who will need a
little extra sensitivity.

56
00:02:27,581 --> 00:02:30,431
So remember to employ

57
00:02:30,533 --> 00:02:34,536
your R, O, C, and you will...

58
00:02:34,638 --> 00:02:37,455
"rock" your patient's world.
OK, that's enough of that.

59
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:39,591
Follow me to the pit.

60
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,292
Hustle!

61
00:02:41,395 --> 00:02:43,962
<i>The skin doesn't
matter to a surgeon.</i>

62
00:02:44,064 --> 00:02:46,899
<i>We'll cut right
through it, go inside,</i>

63
00:02:47,001 --> 00:02:48,800
<i>find out the secrets underneath.</i>

64
00:02:48,903 --> 00:02:52,037
So did you get Izzie's message?
Did you send the divorce papers?

65
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:54,000
I gotta find them,
then I'll send them.

66
00:02:54,024 --> 00:02:57,842
- Izzie sent you divorce papers?
- Yeah. So?

67
00:02:57,944 --> 00:03:00,423
Nothing. Just...
congratulations.

68
00:03:00,447 --> 00:03:02,525
Or... something. Excuse me.

69
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:04,682
<i>It takes delicacy
and sensitivity.</i>

70
00:03:04,784 --> 00:03:07,002
- What's her problem?
- She cares. That's her problem.

71
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:08,253
She cares about you.

72
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:10,138
She doesn't. It's
not like we're a thing.

73
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,374
Well, you should make it
a thing or put a stop to it.

74
00:03:18,015 --> 00:03:20,359
All right, people, remember
what you've been taught.

75
00:03:20,383 --> 00:03:21,716
Use it throughout the day.

76
00:03:21,818 --> 00:03:24,503
There will be
consequences if you don't.

77
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:28,039
What the hell is it?

78
00:03:31,912 --> 00:03:33,672
Did the circus come to town?

79
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:39,167
Nope. Just the elephant.

80
00:03:39,269 --> 00:03:42,520
Avery, you're off the case. Go.

81
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:44,139
Damn it.

82
00:03:44,675 --> 00:03:46,625
Consequences.

83
00:03:48,679 --> 00:03:52,313
We're gonna need
a bigger hospital.

84
00:03:53,283 --> 00:03:54,432
Coming through!

85
00:03:54,534 --> 00:03:58,136
All right, on three.
One, two, go!

86
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:01,773
Easy. That's it.

87
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:05,076
Let's get him a chem
panel, CBC and LFTs.

88
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:06,422
- Type and cross.
- Got it.

89
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:08,330
Now does that hurt?

90
00:04:08,432 --> 00:04:10,616
Sweetheart, I
can't even feel that.

91
00:04:10,718 --> 00:04:12,962
- Having trouble
finding a vein here.
- Or anywhere.

92
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:14,948
I'm using up all
your doctors here.

93
00:04:14,972 --> 00:04:17,221
Probably somebody
dying somewhere, right?

94
00:04:19,543 --> 00:04:21,393
X-ray.

95
00:04:24,414 --> 00:04:26,598
Now I understand
the sensitivity training.

96
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,750
- Yeah, no fat jokes.
- Yang, you're off the case.

97
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:31,736
- I said no fat j...
- Goodbye.

98
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:35,389
Clear.

99
00:04:37,728 --> 00:04:41,462
Sir, when did the stomach
pains become more acute?

100
00:04:41,564 --> 00:04:43,448
Last couple days, I guess.

101
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:46,601
It's hard to keep track.
I'm a real busy guy.

102
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:47,847
- I'm here!
- Let's roll him.

103
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:50,238
- Bobby, are you OK?
- I'm sorry, you are?

104
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:52,240
I'm his wife.

105
00:04:54,928 --> 00:04:57,728
- Facial expressions.
- Hon, I'm fine.

106
00:04:57,814 --> 00:05:01,533
Melissa worries. She likes to
make mountains out of molehills.

107
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:03,118
And I'm already a mountain.

108
00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:11,025
Man. Tough crowd.

109
00:05:11,128 --> 00:05:14,229
Mr. Corso, we're gonna
need to turn you over again.

110
00:05:16,933 --> 00:05:18,750
Whoa, whoa.

111
00:05:18,852 --> 00:05:21,619
Dr. Webber. Look at that.

112
00:05:27,861 --> 00:05:29,995
You poppin' the hood down there?

113
00:05:35,719 --> 00:05:37,219
Facial expressions.

114
00:05:37,321 --> 00:05:39,199
- Dr. Altman.
- Dibs!

115
00:05:39,223 --> 00:05:41,289
- Do you need any help today?
- I'm free.

116
00:05:41,391 --> 00:05:43,536
Aren't you both on Webber's
big emergent patient?

117
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,106
- He got kicked off
for making a joke.
- She got kicked off, too.

118
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:48,730
- But for not making
a joke, so dibs.
- Both of you.

119
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:50,932
I've got a consult in the pit.

120
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,620
- Jamie Anders? Hi.
- Hi.

121
00:05:55,723 --> 00:05:57,538
Dr. Torres.

122
00:05:57,641 --> 00:05:59,752
Oh, wow. What the hell
did you do to your knee?

123
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:03,294
Some jackass mowed me down
on my bike and then took off.

124
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:05,012
Hit and run? That sucks.

125
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:07,532
OK, this is probably
gonna hurt a little,

126
00:06:07,634 --> 00:06:10,518
but I need to get in there
and see what's going on, OK?

127
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,320
Go for it.

128
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:14,555
- No, no! Don't go for it!
- Sorry. You OK?

129
00:06:14,657 --> 00:06:17,809
- Wow! This really blows.
- That's one messed-up patella.

130
00:06:17,911 --> 00:06:20,211
- Plus, I'm out 20 bucks.
- What do you mean?

131
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:22,630
My friend said there's
always an upside to an injury,

132
00:06:22,732 --> 00:06:24,015
and I said she was on crack,

133
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:26,145
and she said, "Watch,
the doctor'll be hot."

134
00:06:26,169 --> 00:06:28,803
I said, "The doctor
will be old and gnarly."

135
00:06:28,905 --> 00:06:33,341
Now you show up, which
means I owe her 20 bucks.

136
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:42,901
Nancy Temple, 39, complaining of
nausea and dizziness since waking today.

137
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:44,736
Then she threw up. Twice.

138
00:06:44,838 --> 00:06:46,583
Kelly said I had
to go to the doctor.

139
00:06:46,607 --> 00:06:48,789
At school, you
have to if you vomit.

140
00:06:48,892 --> 00:06:51,075
Good call, Kelly.
Let's have a listen.

141
00:06:54,798 --> 00:06:57,115
- How's her EKG look?
- It's coming up right now.

142
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:01,753
Having any chest pains or
numbness in your arms or fingers?

143
00:07:01,855 --> 00:07:03,688
No, not at all. Why?

144
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,518
Nancy, heart attack
symptoms show up

145
00:07:05,542 --> 00:07:07,404
completely differently
in women than in men.

146
00:07:07,428 --> 00:07:08,654
They're often missed.

147
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:11,346
Sometimes, they just
look like stomach problems.

148
00:07:11,448 --> 00:07:14,093
- Are you saying...?
- You're having
a heart attack now.

149
00:07:14,117 --> 00:07:16,901
Let's hang a nitro drip
and call the cath lab.

150
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:18,664
What about my daughter?
We're here alone.

151
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:21,155
We're flying back to Miami
tonight. And my husband...

152
00:07:21,258 --> 00:07:23,458
We'll call your husband,
let him know what's going on.

153
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:25,655
Dr. Yang will take care of
Kelly until your tests are done.

154
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:28,399
- No! I mean...
- It's patient
sensitivity day,

155
00:07:28,431 --> 00:07:30,949
- right, Dr. Yang?
- It's not a day.

156
00:07:31,051 --> 00:07:34,886
Take care of Kelly and Avery
will page you when we're ready.

157
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,838
- Mommy!
- Sweetheart!

158
00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:42,327
- I want to go with her.
- I know, I know.

159
00:07:42,429 --> 00:07:43,911
So do I.

160
00:07:45,682 --> 00:07:47,816
How long has he
had that infection?

161
00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:50,078
I've never seen it
before. Nothing like that.

162
00:07:50,119 --> 00:07:52,203
- What is it?
- We don't know yet.

163
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,533
It could be superficial,
or it might be something

164
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:57,475
- worse going on internally.
- I'm gonna be fine, baby.

165
00:07:57,577 --> 00:07:58,826
Don't worry.

166
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:01,491
- Oh!
- Karev!

167
00:08:01,515 --> 00:08:05,032
Crap. I thought we'd clear
it. Let's take the sides off.

168
00:08:05,135 --> 00:08:08,436
We should put a "wide
load" banner on this thing.

169
00:08:08,538 --> 00:08:11,005
We have a gurney right here.
Couldn't we move him onto this?

170
00:08:11,107 --> 00:08:13,736
- No, I don't
want to have him...
- Yeah, I can do it.

171
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,544
No, no, no. Sir,
let us move you.

172
00:08:16,646 --> 00:08:19,263
Come on, come on.
It's only two steps.

173
00:08:19,349 --> 00:08:21,932
It's either that or you gotta
grease me up like a stuck pig.

174
00:08:22,018 --> 00:08:25,820
- Nobody wants that job.
- He hasn't walked
in a year. Bobby!

175
00:08:26,356 --> 00:08:28,556
OK. Easy, easy.

176
00:08:33,997 --> 00:08:35,507
I didn't think I could do this!

177
00:08:35,531 --> 00:08:38,449
Oh, my God, baby,
you're standing!

178
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:41,219
You know what
this reminds me of?

179
00:08:41,321 --> 00:08:42,837
Our wedding.

180
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:57,635
Um... Bimalleolar
ankle fracture.

181
00:08:57,738 --> 00:08:58,948
It was too weak to
support his weight.

182
00:08:58,972 --> 00:09:00,884
- He can go to CT now.
- He's not going in that CT.

183
00:09:00,908 --> 00:09:02,551
I think if we can
position him...

184
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:03,819
It's rated for half his weight.

185
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:05,805
If it breaks, he gets hurt
again, it's not available

186
00:09:05,829 --> 00:09:07,456
for the 50 other
patients who need it.

187
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:11,583
What about the zoo? They gotta
have a CT for, like, rhinos, right?

188
00:09:11,685 --> 00:09:13,034
Percy, off the case. Goodbye.

189
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:14,780
That wasn't a joke. That
was an actual suggestion.

190
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:18,772
- Go.
- It's a pretty
good idea, actually.

191
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:20,786
- It's a terrible idea.
- - We will spare this man

192
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:23,144
the indignity of treating
him like a zoo animal.

193
00:09:23,263 --> 00:09:26,481
If we can't get an image, we'll
go with clinical labs and tests.

194
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:28,463
I could do a nuclear
stress test on his heart.

195
00:09:28,518 --> 00:09:29,862
I just wish I could
get him on a treadmill.

196
00:09:29,886 --> 00:09:32,854
That's not gonna happen.

197
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:37,642
All right. I have a lawyer
waiting for me, I have to go.

198
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:40,022
I want a meeting with all of
you when his studies come back,

199
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:41,857
before we go any further
down this road, OK?

200
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:43,697
Let's work him up.

201
00:09:49,222 --> 00:09:51,156
So just a couple more questions.

202
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:54,976
His diabetes, did he
have it before he was...

203
00:09:55,078 --> 00:09:57,740
- immobilized?
- No. That's since
he put on the weight.

204
00:09:57,764 --> 00:10:01,282
And that's been,
um...? How long has...?

205
00:10:01,385 --> 00:10:04,252
How long has he been like this?

206
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:07,772
Five years ago, his company
laid off 300 employees.

207
00:10:07,874 --> 00:10:11,192
He tried to find work for
two years. No one was hiring.

208
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:13,979
And then he stopped trying.

209
00:10:14,081 --> 00:10:17,582
It was real hard on him. And food,
well, food made him feel better. So...

210
00:10:17,684 --> 00:10:20,351
I think he's been
in pain for a while.

211
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:23,755
He'd tell me it's indigestion,
but I couldn't ignore it.

212
00:10:23,857 --> 00:10:27,391
- After the news,
I just had to call.
- The news?

213
00:10:27,493 --> 00:10:29,994
Well, we're gonna have
a baby. I'm pregnant.

214
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:31,763
How?

215
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:37,969
I mean... Wow! Congratulations!

216
00:10:38,071 --> 00:10:40,754
That is... That's joyous news.

217
00:10:41,624 --> 00:10:42,734
You're off the case.

218
00:10:52,935 --> 00:10:54,363
- Hi.
- Hey.

219
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:55,519
Your deposition's today?

220
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:56,901
Yeah. Let me ask you something.

221
00:10:56,956 --> 00:10:58,856
Teddy and Owen,
can they work together?

222
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:00,992
- What do you mean?
- Nothing. I was just surprised

223
00:11:01,094 --> 00:11:05,129
he didn't go to bat for her getting
the job. It was like he wanted her to go.

224
00:11:05,231 --> 00:11:07,965
- Really?
- I gotta go.

225
00:11:08,068 --> 00:11:09,734
Good luck.

226
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:11,402
Hey, what are you doing?

227
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:15,673
- Um... Bobby Corso's labs.
- Still on Fatty Fatty
Two By Four?

228
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:17,459
- No fair.
- Uh, name calling...

229
00:11:17,561 --> 00:11:18,988
- Who's this?
- My patient's kid.

230
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:21,157
The social worker
won't return my page.

231
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:23,021
- That's not very social.
- Where's Callie?

232
00:11:23,066 --> 00:11:24,832
She's been whining for a kid.

233
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:26,217
Cristina?

234
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,236
What?

235
00:11:28,338 --> 00:11:31,306
Um... Oh, never mind.

236
00:11:35,579 --> 00:11:38,429
They have no case.
Gary Clark is grieving.

237
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:39,925
You can do me
one favor in there.

238
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:42,567
Try not to refer to her
as "Mrs. Clark" or "she."

239
00:11:42,669 --> 00:11:45,336
Don't use pronouns,
just stick to "the patient."

240
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:49,023
- It keeps it less emotional.
- OK.

241
00:11:52,179 --> 00:11:54,496
- So why is he here?
- Sorry?

242
00:11:54,598 --> 00:11:57,665
Gary Clark. He shouldn't be here
for this. He doesn't need to hear this.

243
00:11:57,767 --> 00:12:00,445
He's the plaintiff, it's his
prerogative. Don't let it bother you.

244
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:02,131
I'm more worried
it's gonna bother him.

245
00:12:06,293 --> 00:12:07,909
Sorry. I have to go.

246
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:14,004
Hey. Is the meeting with
Shepherd in the conference room?

247
00:12:14,034 --> 00:12:15,466
Mm-hm.

248
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:20,855
Thank you.

249
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:23,307
My contract came in, and

250
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,421
Cristina told me you
put in a good word.

251
00:12:25,445 --> 00:12:27,928
So... thanks.

252
00:12:28,964 --> 00:12:30,281
Of course.

253
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:41,642
- What?
- Nothing.

254
00:12:46,149 --> 00:12:47,598
What are we looking at?

255
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,685
The patient's got a severe deep
tissue infection under his belly.

256
00:12:50,787 --> 00:12:53,888
There's a significant abscess. Hunt
and I need to get in there and debride,

257
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:56,573
- clear out the infected fat.
- Sudden fat loss is dangerous.

258
00:12:56,676 --> 00:13:00,144
It's preferable to him dying of an
infection. It's a risky surgery, yes.

259
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:01,907
Have Bailey and
Webber on standby

260
00:13:01,931 --> 00:13:04,393
- in case he goes south.
- What is the surgical
risk calculation

261
00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:06,545
- on a patient like this?
- Almost too high to calculate.

262
00:13:06,569 --> 00:13:10,104
Five times the risk of heart
attack, respiratory failure,

263
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:12,524
- airway complications.
- He's diabetic,

264
00:13:12,626 --> 00:13:14,303
there's risk of a
ketoacidotic coma.

265
00:13:14,327 --> 00:13:15,921
High risk of pulmonary embolism.

266
00:13:15,945 --> 00:13:17,622
Believe it or not,
he's malnourished,

267
00:13:17,646 --> 00:13:19,814
which leads to slow
healing, renal failure...

268
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:21,966
Nerve damage, post-op infection.

269
00:13:22,068 --> 00:13:23,646
I'm saying no. The risk
is too high. That's all.

270
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:25,369
Thank you, but that's it.

271
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,372
You're saying we
send him away to die?

272
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:30,675
We send him to a bariatric center
prepared for a patient like this,

273
00:13:30,777 --> 00:13:33,189
instead of us spending our time
and resources caring for someone

274
00:13:33,213 --> 00:13:35,630
who obviously
doesn't care for himself.

275
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:49,127
Derek, he's me.

276
00:13:49,229 --> 00:13:51,662
Just swap out the
booze for the food.

277
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:53,597
You don't think I
care about myself?

278
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:57,401
He has an illness that he
cannot control, he needs help.

279
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:00,404
- I'm sorry. I...
- That wasn't you in there.

280
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:03,257
And that wasn't about Bobby
Corso. It was about Gary Clark.

281
00:14:03,359 --> 00:14:06,410
You're seeing potential lawsuits
where you used to see patients.

282
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:09,775
It's the job, Derek. The job
can change your priorities.

283
00:14:09,799 --> 00:14:13,384
- Excuse me, Shepherd?
- Derek, don't let it.

284
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,004
Tell Sloan to go
ahead and open him up.

285
00:14:17,373 --> 00:14:18,606
Yes?

286
00:14:19,676 --> 00:14:21,743
The conversation
we had about Altman,

287
00:14:21,845 --> 00:14:23,260
did you share that with anyone?

288
00:14:24,397 --> 00:14:26,731
- I...
- Did you share that
with your wife?

289
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,817
Did Meredith say something?

290
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:32,753
When I make a professional
recommendation about a fellow attending,

291
00:14:32,855 --> 00:14:36,140
I expect it to be kept in confidence.
I do not expect to hear about it

292
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:39,193
from one of my residents. I
thought I could assume that much.

293
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:43,014
How's your day going?

294
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:46,968
- Dr. Grey.
- Uh, yeah.

295
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:50,455
Jamie, we're going to open up
your knee and wire all the pieces

296
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:53,257
- of your patella back together.
- Are you gonna do
the operation?

297
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:54,803
- Yep.
- You'll hold my hand

298
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:56,477
through the whole thing?

299
00:14:56,579 --> 00:14:58,374
I think it's better if
I'm holding the scalpel.

300
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:02,266
- But I can hold
your hand right now.
- Fine.

301
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:03,617
OK.

302
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:06,587
Do you have any other questions?

303
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:10,141
I can't think of anything, but I don't
want the hand holding part to end,

304
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:11,758
so can we sit here a minute?

305
00:15:11,861 --> 00:15:16,930
You are so bad. I
will see you in the OR.

306
00:15:23,773 --> 00:15:25,839
Wow. Should we
have left you two alone?

307
00:15:25,941 --> 00:15:29,377
- What?
- Getting a little
steamy in there.

308
00:15:29,479 --> 00:15:32,180
Give me a break. I'm in
a committed relationship.

309
00:15:32,282 --> 00:15:34,499
- That was chit-chat.
- Yeah, there was steam.

310
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:37,201
- It was steamy chit-chat.
- With hand holding.

311
00:15:37,304 --> 00:15:40,621
Yeah, physical contact is an important
part of establishing a patient's trust.

312
00:15:40,723 --> 00:15:42,468
Bailey did patient
sensitivity this morning.

313
00:15:42,492 --> 00:15:43,774
Did she teach you nothing?

314
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:47,444
So there was no flirting going
on. I was just imagining that.

315
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:49,563
She was flirty, and
I was flirty back,

316
00:15:49,665 --> 00:15:51,566
because I'm trying
to put her at ease.

317
00:15:51,668 --> 00:15:53,662
Talking to the patient the
way the patient talks to you,

318
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:57,488
makes them feel
understood. And safe.

319
00:15:57,590 --> 00:16:00,825
And... you're morons.

320
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:05,112
Oh, and a little pervy. Jeez.

321
00:16:12,121 --> 00:16:14,288
- Put me down for 715.
- Got it.

322
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,924
- What happens at 7:15?
- 715 is her bet.

323
00:16:17,026 --> 00:16:19,527
I'm making a pool on
Bobby Corso's actual weight.

324
00:16:19,629 --> 00:16:23,897
Twenty bucks. Closest without
going over wins the pot. You want in?

325
00:16:23,999 --> 00:16:26,734
How are you still on that case?

326
00:16:26,836 --> 00:16:29,403
Artificial insemination.
It had to be.

327
00:16:29,505 --> 00:16:31,872
- What are we talking about?
- Bobby Corso.

328
00:16:31,974 --> 00:16:33,724
How did they make a baby?

329
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:36,928
He hasn't left the house in five
years. It took a truck to get him here.

330
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:39,191
How's he supposed to go to
a fertility clinic to fill up a cup?

331
00:16:39,215 --> 00:16:42,316
- How does he find it
to fill up a cup?
- They can still do it.

332
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:46,019
- The regular way. Right?
- Have you seen the guy move?

333
00:16:46,121 --> 00:16:47,955
'Cause he can't, really. At all.

334
00:16:48,057 --> 00:16:50,825
Maybe he doesn't have to.
Maybe she does all the work.

335
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:54,078
- But how? I mean...
- I'm finished.

336
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:56,831
Oh, um...

337
00:16:58,401 --> 00:16:59,784
Get yourself some ice cream.

338
00:16:59,886 --> 00:17:02,236
But I'm not allowed to
have that much sugar.

339
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:06,557
- Get some roast beef then.
- She can sit.

340
00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:10,294
No, she can't. We're
talking about S-E-X.

341
00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:12,897
I'm nine, and you
just spelled "sex."

342
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,133
- That's good.
- OK. Know what?

343
00:17:16,236 --> 00:17:18,419
Let's say this is the wife.

344
00:17:18,521 --> 00:17:22,606
- No! Don't do that.
- And this is... him.

345
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,659
- I won't be eating that now.
- She's gotta be on top.

346
00:17:25,761 --> 00:17:28,912
She might get altitude sickness.

347
00:17:29,582 --> 00:17:30,931
Guys.

348
00:17:34,087 --> 00:17:37,121
- Sorry. Um...
- It's all right. I get it.

349
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:40,741
You're trying to figure how my husband
and I managed to get a baby in here.

350
00:17:40,843 --> 00:17:43,077
There are some
logistics involved.

351
00:17:43,179 --> 00:17:44,762
You want me to tell you?

352
00:17:47,116 --> 00:17:51,135
But first, how about you tell me how
you like to do it with your husband.

353
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:53,554
Or your girlfriend?
Any favorite positions?

354
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:56,557
Or kinks! Let's talk about that!

355
00:17:56,659 --> 00:18:00,494
Because I know you all must have
a freakshow of your own going on.

356
00:18:00,596 --> 00:18:02,396
Who wants to go first?

357
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:06,734
No? Nobody?

358
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:10,054
OK.

359
00:18:10,156 --> 00:18:14,125
Well, it's probably none of
my damn business anyway.

360
00:18:25,805 --> 00:18:29,289
The fat under your skin
has become necrotic.

361
00:18:29,992 --> 00:18:31,625
It has died.

362
00:18:31,728 --> 00:18:34,695
And the infection is
eating through your skin.

363
00:18:36,432 --> 00:18:39,752
I suppose it had to come to
that. I've eaten everything else.

364
00:18:39,835 --> 00:18:41,930
The operation is
extremely risky.

365
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:43,834
You have a higher
than normal chance

366
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:47,007
that a surgical
complication can kill you.

367
00:18:48,027 --> 00:18:51,462
If I don't have
the surgery, I die?

368
00:18:54,434 --> 00:18:56,267
How long will I
have, do you think?

369
00:18:56,369 --> 00:19:00,638
Mr. Corso, you want the surgery.

370
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:03,674
- You want to try.
- I've tried.

371
00:19:05,177 --> 00:19:06,711
Everything.

372
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:10,447
High protein, the low carbs,

373
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:12,582
drugs, pills, hypnosis.

374
00:19:12,668 --> 00:19:15,285
I've tried everything.

375
00:19:15,388 --> 00:19:18,239
You have a baby on
the way. Think about that.

376
00:19:18,341 --> 00:19:21,024
What do you think
I'm thinking about?

377
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:23,894
You...

378
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:26,947
You dream of having a kid.

379
00:19:27,049 --> 00:19:30,584
You picture yourself
playing ball with him.

380
00:19:30,686 --> 00:19:33,671
You picture her
standing on your feet

381
00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:35,812
while you dance around
with her, you know?

382
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:41,528
You don't picture them bringing
you food and cleaning you up.

383
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,418
I can't walk four steps
to go to the bathroom.

384
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,421
You tell me,

385
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:52,590
who deserves that
guy as a father?

386
00:19:56,296 --> 00:19:58,262
I just want to be gone

387
00:19:58,364 --> 00:20:00,714
before the kid has a
chance to know who I am.

388
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:04,869
Don't tell my wife
about this, OK?

389
00:20:04,971 --> 00:20:08,105
Let's just tell
her it's too risky.

390
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:11,909
Let me go home.

391
00:20:18,184 --> 00:20:21,718
- Hey, peanut.
- What's going on?

392
00:20:27,576 --> 00:20:30,678
- Can we see my mom now?
- I'm trying to find out.

393
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:33,013
- Is she gonna be OK?
- You want an honest answer?

394
00:20:33,115 --> 00:20:35,382
- Yes.
- I don't know.

395
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:37,918
Do you know anything?

396
00:20:41,557 --> 00:20:43,407
I hear that you're scared.

397
00:20:43,509 --> 00:20:46,710
It's scary when your
mom or dad gets hurt

398
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:50,281
- and you feel alone.
- How do you know?

399
00:20:53,135 --> 00:20:54,434
'Cause when I was your age,

400
00:20:54,536 --> 00:20:56,414
my dad and I were
in a car accident

401
00:20:56,438 --> 00:21:00,473
and he was hurt and I was
really scared. So I know.

402
00:21:02,828 --> 00:21:04,478
Was your dad OK?

403
00:21:06,549 --> 00:21:08,249
Yep. He was fine.

404
00:21:08,351 --> 00:21:10,751
Now, let's go see
about your mom.

405
00:21:12,171 --> 00:21:13,804
Get back, get back!

406
00:21:13,906 --> 00:21:16,874
- What happened?
- Echo shows a ventricular
wall rupture.

407
00:21:16,976 --> 00:21:19,321
- OR 2's ready, they're waiting.
- Yang, you coming?

408
00:21:19,345 --> 00:21:22,813
- Yeah. What about the kid?
- I'll take her.

409
00:21:23,182 --> 00:21:24,915
Mommy?!

410
00:21:25,467 --> 00:21:26,850
Mommy!

411
00:21:26,953 --> 00:21:28,802
- Do you need me?
- What?

412
00:21:28,904 --> 00:21:31,505
- You have Avery. Do you need me?
- Yang, in or out. Let's go.

413
00:21:31,607 --> 00:21:33,307
Um...

414
00:21:46,272 --> 00:21:49,373
You wanted me to
sign discharge papers?

415
00:21:52,945 --> 00:21:57,247
Mrs. Corso, I'm sorry about
the thing in the cafeteria.

416
00:21:57,349 --> 00:22:00,017
It's easy to make
jokes about him.

417
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:01,752
You didn't know him before.

418
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:07,808
You don't know that inside all that
is the same man I've always known.

419
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:10,677
Who can make me
laugh till I can't breathe.

420
00:22:11,981 --> 00:22:14,014
He's been trying to make
you guys laugh all day,

421
00:22:14,117 --> 00:22:18,869
but you're too disgusted to
even smile or joke with him.

422
00:22:18,971 --> 00:22:21,005
Make him feel like a person.

423
00:22:22,308 --> 00:22:25,442
I brought him here because
I thought you would help him.

424
00:22:26,545 --> 00:22:30,147
But you're only
making him feel worse.

425
00:22:30,249 --> 00:22:32,950
So unless you want
to tell me the next step

426
00:22:33,052 --> 00:22:34,719
to getting him out
of here and home,

427
00:22:34,821 --> 00:22:36,887
I don't need to hear
anything from you.

428
00:22:53,706 --> 00:22:56,540
Are you bringing
my forklift around?

429
00:22:56,642 --> 00:23:00,211
We thought we'd just open up
the loading dock and roll you out.

430
00:23:00,312 --> 00:23:02,446
That's good.

431
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:04,281
Right into Puget Sound.

432
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:07,651
Float me home like a barge.

433
00:23:07,754 --> 00:23:09,386
- I got a good one.
- Yeah?

434
00:23:09,488 --> 00:23:11,500
What did they call
the guy who was so fat,

435
00:23:11,524 --> 00:23:13,068
he couldn't get
out of the house?

436
00:23:13,092 --> 00:23:14,842
- What?
- Dead.

437
00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:18,028
And selfish.

438
00:23:18,781 --> 00:23:19,781
Yeah.

439
00:23:19,882 --> 00:23:23,016
'Cause you left a 700-pound mess

440
00:23:23,118 --> 00:23:24,852
for your wife to clean up.

441
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,323
That's a good one.

442
00:23:29,425 --> 00:23:33,126
Look, I'm sorry that we've
been tiptoeing around you all day,

443
00:23:33,229 --> 00:23:36,096
trying not to make jokes,

444
00:23:36,199 --> 00:23:38,999
but you're the one
who's gotta stop.

445
00:23:39,101 --> 00:23:42,035
Stop calling
yourself the fat guy.

446
00:23:42,137 --> 00:23:44,421
You got a wife who loves you.

447
00:23:44,523 --> 00:23:47,691
You know, who stuck
by you through all this.

448
00:23:47,793 --> 00:23:50,110
You did something
right to deserve that.

449
00:23:51,613 --> 00:23:54,131
I know what it's like to have
life hand you so much crap

450
00:23:54,233 --> 00:23:57,668
you just want to sit
on the couch and die.

451
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:00,171
But you gotta look at
what's in front of you.

452
00:24:01,507 --> 00:24:05,709
You can't just walk out on
her now. She deserves better.

453
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:11,965
Look, chances are, you're
gonna die on that table.

454
00:24:12,067 --> 00:24:14,167
Then you get what you want.

455
00:24:14,269 --> 00:24:17,337
But at least your wife
will think you tried.

456
00:24:17,439 --> 00:24:19,739
She'll tell your kid you tried.

457
00:24:22,911 --> 00:24:24,978
Give 'em that at least.

458
00:25:18,951 --> 00:25:20,851
How'd you get
back on the surgery?

459
00:25:20,953 --> 00:25:22,497
They said they needed big guys.

460
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:26,223
Karev, Percy, retracting the
abdomen. Adamson, stay there.

461
00:25:26,325 --> 00:25:28,125
Kepner, over there.

462
00:25:28,227 --> 00:25:30,444
Where do you want me?

463
00:25:30,546 --> 00:25:33,130
I think we are good.

464
00:25:34,433 --> 00:25:36,450
That's all we need.

465
00:25:43,976 --> 00:25:46,677
Did you irrigate the ears to
induce an ocular response?

466
00:25:46,778 --> 00:25:48,895
- No. That was not necessary.
- Why?

467
00:25:48,997 --> 00:25:52,899
- The patient had
a pupillary response.
- So you saw life in her eyes?

468
00:25:57,106 --> 00:25:59,973
- There was
a pupillary response.
- Yet you declared her dead.

469
00:26:00,075 --> 00:26:02,320
- No, you misunderstood.
- Absence of a pupillary
response

470
00:26:02,344 --> 00:26:03,838
is one of the signs
of brain death,

471
00:26:03,862 --> 00:26:05,373
yet you declared her brain dead.

472
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:09,666
I never declared her brain dead.
She had minimal brain activity.

473
00:26:11,353 --> 00:26:13,236
I'm sorry, I tried
to explain to you...

474
00:26:13,338 --> 00:26:15,688
So she was alive
until you withdrew care.

475
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:19,994
- Until you pulled the plug.
- I'm sorry. I'm not being clear.

476
00:26:20,096 --> 00:26:23,180
According to the letter
of her advance directive,

477
00:26:23,265 --> 00:26:27,434
there was a level
of brain activity

478
00:26:27,536 --> 00:26:29,881
- that I judged...
- That you judged. You decided.

479
00:26:29,905 --> 00:26:32,339
It was my opinion to...

480
00:26:34,143 --> 00:26:35,175
Should we stop?

481
00:26:35,277 --> 00:26:37,205
I'm gonna suggest
we take a break.

482
00:26:37,229 --> 00:26:38,862
Get ourselves together,
resume later on.

483
00:26:38,947 --> 00:26:41,231
- Does that sound all right?
- Fine.

484
00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:49,300
You remember when I told
you they don't have a case?

485
00:26:49,324 --> 00:26:51,591
- Yes.
- With respect, Dr. Shepherd,

486
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:55,111
please stop trying to give
them one. Do not apologize.

487
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:00,734
OK.

488
00:27:04,357 --> 00:27:06,123
The infection's really deep.

489
00:27:06,225 --> 00:27:09,026
- Underneath all this fat is just...
- - More fat.

490
00:27:09,128 --> 00:27:11,606
- I'm down to the abdominal wall.
- - How's the fascia?

491
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:14,331
Not too good. Wanna
take a look inside?

492
00:27:16,135 --> 00:27:20,086
It's probably a can
of worms, but here.

493
00:27:21,573 --> 00:27:25,241
Let's have a little peek.

494
00:27:28,864 --> 00:27:31,181
Damn it! We have to go in.

495
00:27:31,283 --> 00:27:35,618
- Bailey, Webber,
you scrub in? Fast?
- OK.

496
00:27:44,396 --> 00:27:46,429
So there's a hole in the wall?

497
00:27:46,532 --> 00:27:50,333
Right, and the blood is supposed
to go from one room to another,

498
00:27:50,435 --> 00:27:53,087
except it's just rushing
outside through the hole.

499
00:27:53,189 --> 00:27:57,091
And it can't get to
her brain? Got it.

500
00:27:58,127 --> 00:27:59,993
Yes. Or to her lungs.

501
00:28:00,096 --> 00:28:03,363
- So they're gonna
sew up the hole?
- They'll try to.

502
00:28:03,466 --> 00:28:06,616
But the heart has to
be strong, like, um...

503
00:28:06,719 --> 00:28:08,986
Like nylon. Like your shoes.

504
00:28:10,972 --> 00:28:14,191
Your mom's heart
is weak. Like paper.

505
00:28:19,582 --> 00:28:21,648
What happens if she dies?

506
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:26,219
We'll talk about
that if it happens.

507
00:28:26,321 --> 00:28:28,889
Gotcha. Mine.

508
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:45,305
If your mom dies...

509
00:28:47,309 --> 00:28:49,025
you'll feel a lot of things.

510
00:28:52,197 --> 00:28:54,031
First, you'll feel like, uh...

511
00:28:54,132 --> 00:28:56,366
you could have done
more to help her, but...

512
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:58,768
that's not true.

513
00:28:59,688 --> 00:29:02,088
You did everything you could.

514
00:29:04,092 --> 00:29:06,193
It won't feel that way, but...

515
00:29:07,629 --> 00:29:10,247
remember me telling you this:

516
00:29:10,348 --> 00:29:12,465
You did everything you could.

517
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:18,705
And it will hurt, every
time you think of her.

518
00:29:21,226 --> 00:29:24,428
But over time, it will
hurt less and less.

519
00:29:25,431 --> 00:29:27,564
And eventually...

520
00:29:29,418 --> 00:29:31,651
you'll remember her and...

521
00:29:31,753 --> 00:29:33,753
it will only hurt a little.

522
00:29:50,156 --> 00:29:52,923
I'm not gonna be here in the
morning when they let you go,

523
00:29:53,025 --> 00:29:55,926
so if it hurts before your
follow-up, give me a call.

524
00:29:56,028 --> 00:29:59,495
OK? And if it's oozing
green stuff, call me.

525
00:29:59,597 --> 00:30:02,815
Can I call you if it's late at
night and I'm kind of drunk

526
00:30:02,918 --> 00:30:05,985
and I run across an old John
Hughes movie on the tube?

527
00:30:06,088 --> 00:30:07,954
Wow, um...

528
00:30:08,723 --> 00:30:10,283
- I don't, uh...
- Here.

529
00:30:10,325 --> 00:30:11,508
I don't think...

530
00:30:13,195 --> 00:30:15,612
- Just...
- What?

531
00:30:16,649 --> 00:30:19,683
- Use that...
- Um...

532
00:30:20,653 --> 00:30:22,619
if the spirit moves you.

533
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:27,090
Now, get out of here.

534
00:30:27,692 --> 00:30:29,159
I'm on drugs.

535
00:30:30,145 --> 00:30:32,078
OK.

536
00:30:37,986 --> 00:30:40,420
Pull that back more. I
can't see what I'm doing.

537
00:30:40,522 --> 00:30:43,473
- This? Is this good?
- No! More!

538
00:30:43,576 --> 00:30:46,693
I think I found the
culprit. Diverticulitis.

539
00:30:46,795 --> 00:30:49,279
Perforated colon.
Completely infected.

540
00:30:49,381 --> 00:30:50,941
- How long's he been under?
- Too long.

541
00:30:50,965 --> 00:30:53,784
This abscess will kill him if
we don't get it under control.

542
00:30:55,621 --> 00:30:58,555
- OK, keep it together.
- Let's pick up the pace,
people.

543
00:30:58,657 --> 00:31:00,623
Laps. Come on.

544
00:31:00,709 --> 00:31:02,342
More.

545
00:31:03,011 --> 00:31:04,811
Pack it in.

546
00:31:13,105 --> 00:31:15,272
Hey. How's the deposition going?

547
00:31:15,374 --> 00:31:16,906
- Apparently, I can't tell you.
- Why?

548
00:31:17,008 --> 00:31:18,586
Why did you tell
Hunt what I told you?

549
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:21,528
- I didn't, I told him nothing.
- He came to me
and said you knew.

550
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:23,825
No. I told him nothing.
I looked at him...

551
00:31:23,849 --> 00:31:27,016
You looked at him. When you're
pissed, your face says everything.

552
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:28,729
So now I have a staff
that can't trust me.

553
00:31:28,753 --> 00:31:30,713
So, what am I supposed
to do, control my face?

554
00:31:30,772 --> 00:31:33,507
- Yes. Control your face.
- Maybe you shouldn't
tell me things

555
00:31:33,609 --> 00:31:35,525
you don't want me
to know. Control that!

556
00:31:35,628 --> 00:31:36,927
Then I can't tell you anything.

557
00:31:37,029 --> 00:31:39,174
Then 80 percent of my day is
off limits and I don't want that.

558
00:31:39,198 --> 00:31:41,698
I don't want that
either. I'm sorry.

559
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:44,551
I know. It's just...

560
00:31:44,653 --> 00:31:48,105
- But I have to tell Cristina.
- Damn it! What are we
talking about?

561
00:31:48,207 --> 00:31:50,006
Owen lied to her.

562
00:31:50,108 --> 00:31:52,389
And he must have done that
because he still wants Teddy.

563
00:31:52,461 --> 00:31:54,301
- Doesn't matter!
- It doesn't matter to you.

564
00:31:54,363 --> 00:31:56,591
Cristina is my best friend. I
get that you're the chief now,

565
00:31:56,615 --> 00:31:58,693
but she's still the person
she's always been.

566
00:31:58,717 --> 00:32:00,745
Am I supposed to stand
around and watch her get hurt?

567
00:32:00,769 --> 00:32:02,009
What am I supposed to do?

568
00:32:02,103 --> 00:32:05,104
Chief Shepherd, they're ready.

569
00:32:05,941 --> 00:32:09,041
Nothing. You do nothing.

570
00:32:22,574 --> 00:32:24,474
Where's the little girl?

571
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:27,527
Social Services came. We
put her to bed in a patient room.

572
00:32:27,629 --> 00:32:29,613
Her dad should be here
by the time she wakes up.

573
00:32:29,715 --> 00:32:32,465
Good. You were
great with her today.

574
00:32:33,101 --> 00:32:34,601
Thanks.

575
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:38,555
So when did your mom die?

576
00:32:38,657 --> 00:32:41,608
- She didn't.
- Your dad, then?

577
00:32:44,363 --> 00:32:46,674
I'm sorry if that's
too personal.

578
00:32:46,698 --> 00:32:49,899
It was just clear from the way
you were talking to her today.

579
00:32:50,002 --> 00:32:52,522
It's been a long day. I thought
you might want to talk about it.

580
00:32:52,604 --> 00:32:54,638
That's very insightful of you.

581
00:32:55,474 --> 00:32:57,774
You're a super,

582
00:32:57,876 --> 00:32:59,993
super sensitive man.

583
00:33:01,663 --> 00:33:03,746
Let me tell you
what you saw today.

584
00:33:03,848 --> 00:33:07,250
I reflectively listened
to a patient's concerns.

585
00:33:07,352 --> 00:33:10,286
I spoke to her in a language
she could understand.

586
00:33:10,389 --> 00:33:14,274
I clearly stated possible
complications and probable outcomes.

587
00:33:14,376 --> 00:33:15,775
That's all you saw today.

588
00:33:15,877 --> 00:33:18,211
Me kicking patient
sensitivity ass.

589
00:33:18,313 --> 00:33:20,364
So go be someone
else's dish rag.

590
00:33:29,041 --> 00:33:30,407
Hey, what are you doing tonight?

591
00:33:30,509 --> 00:33:32,120
Do you wanna drink?
We should drink.

592
00:33:32,144 --> 00:33:34,189
Although, maybe I shouldn't,
because then I'll talk.

593
00:33:34,213 --> 00:33:37,214
And I'm not allowed to talk
or make a facial expression.

594
00:33:37,316 --> 00:33:39,883
Can you go away,
please? Just go. Go away!

595
00:33:42,287 --> 00:33:45,838
What is it? Cristina,
what's wrong?

596
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:48,508
Owen. Can you get
me Owen, please?

597
00:33:50,996 --> 00:33:53,596
And describe what you
saw in Mrs. Clark's scans.

598
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:56,132
The patient suffered an
acute hemorrhagic stroke

599
00:33:56,235 --> 00:33:59,519
- in the left temporal lobe.
- Based on those scans
and the EEG,

600
00:33:59,621 --> 00:34:01,938
you recommended
that care be withdrawn.

601
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,507
According to the advanced...

602
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:09,112
- Yes.
- How long did that take?

603
00:34:09,214 --> 00:34:13,049
From the time you looked at the
scans until you decided to end her life,

604
00:34:13,151 --> 00:34:16,068
- how much time elapsed?
- We talked to the patient's
family,

605
00:34:16,171 --> 00:34:18,055
assemble an ethics
review committee.

606
00:34:18,157 --> 00:34:20,924
I'm talking about
your assessment.

607
00:34:21,026 --> 00:34:25,111
How long did it take you to decide
to recommend that she should die?

608
00:34:27,849 --> 00:34:30,750
- Less than a minute.
- Less than a minute.

609
00:34:30,853 --> 00:34:33,186
In my professional opinion,
there was no other option.

610
00:34:33,288 --> 00:34:35,705
Thirty-two years.

611
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:40,426
I... I think we have
everything we need.

612
00:34:40,529 --> 00:34:43,129
Alison and I were
married for 32 years.

613
00:34:44,733 --> 00:34:49,018
I loved her for more
than half my life.

614
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:52,455
And you decide to kill
her in less than a minute?

615
00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:55,057
Mr. Clark,

616
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:57,827
- I'm so sorry...
- I begged you.

617
00:34:57,929 --> 00:35:00,041
And you just kept
saying you're sorry.

618
00:35:00,065 --> 00:35:02,649
You just kept saying
legal this and legal that.

619
00:35:02,751 --> 00:35:04,495
- This is no longer productive.
- Gary...

620
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:06,352
I begged you!

621
00:35:06,454 --> 00:35:10,014
But you signed her death sentence!
You didn't even show up to do the job!

622
00:35:10,042 --> 00:35:13,643
You're a coward, Dr. Shepherd!
You're a coward and a killer!

623
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:17,097
Come on.

624
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:18,932
Come with me.

625
00:35:27,759 --> 00:35:30,693
- Dr. Shepherd,
can I have a word?
- What?

626
00:35:30,779 --> 00:35:35,515
Nothing. I'm just keeping you
here until Mr. Clark has gone.

627
00:35:35,617 --> 00:35:38,029
You're a kind man, Dr. Shepherd.
I respect that, I admire that.

628
00:35:38,053 --> 00:35:40,064
But he's grieving,
and they have no case.

629
00:35:40,088 --> 00:35:41,632
He got to say what
he needed to say.

630
00:35:41,656 --> 00:35:44,657
And the kindest thing you
can say to him is nothing.

631
00:35:44,759 --> 00:35:48,378
You can't help him, and
you won't help your hospital.

632
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:52,065
It's over.

633
00:35:52,167 --> 00:35:54,851
I know you want to
do more, but it's over.

634
00:35:59,308 --> 00:36:01,507
It was a pleasure
working with you.

635
00:36:03,728 --> 00:36:07,230
- So you told her.
- I didn't say anything to her.

636
00:36:11,569 --> 00:36:13,837
What? What is it?

637
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:16,873
What happened?

638
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:40,897
I miss my dad.

639
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:55,345
Bobby, you survived the surgery,

640
00:36:55,447 --> 00:36:57,367
but you're not nearly
out of the woods.

641
00:36:57,416 --> 00:37:00,766
We'll still have to watch you
very closely for post-op infections,

642
00:37:00,869 --> 00:37:03,703
and you're gonna have to make
some serious lifestyle changes.

643
00:37:03,821 --> 00:37:06,622
I know. I need to
lose the weight.

644
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:09,525
You have no choice,
if you want to survive.

645
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:14,547
Well, then I have no choice.

646
00:37:18,353 --> 00:37:20,069
Right?

647
00:37:44,096 --> 00:37:45,928
How did it go?

648
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:49,665
Derek, you can talk to me.

649
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:51,779
I don't want to think about
what I can and can't say

650
00:37:51,803 --> 00:37:54,220
and who I can
and can't say it to.

651
00:37:56,374 --> 00:37:58,607
I can't do it anymore today.

652
00:37:59,727 --> 00:38:03,112
I love you. You
know that, right?

653
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,933
I love you, too.

654
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:21,230
<i>No matter how
thick-skinned we try to be...</i>

655
00:38:22,801 --> 00:38:26,619
- Did you find out
Bobby Corso's weight?
- 678.

656
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:28,954
So who won your stupid pool?

657
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:31,657
- Bailey.
- Bailey?

658
00:38:32,426 --> 00:38:34,094
She bet in your pool?

659
00:38:34,196 --> 00:38:35,761
After all of that.

660
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:40,349
Are you kidding me?
My God, the hypocrisy!

661
00:38:42,988 --> 00:38:46,672
<i>There's millions of electrified
nerve endings in there.</i>

662
00:38:57,452 --> 00:39:00,787
- You going home?
- Yeah.

663
00:39:00,889 --> 00:39:03,355
You want to go together?

664
00:39:11,733 --> 00:39:13,999
<i>Open and exposed...</i>

665
00:39:15,002 --> 00:39:18,270
<i>and feeling way too much.</i>

666
00:39:18,372 --> 00:39:21,607
Hey! We scored! My cousin
said we can use their timeshare.

667
00:39:21,709 --> 00:39:24,077
So Fiji. We can either
go at the end of this month

668
00:39:24,179 --> 00:39:25,873
or we could save up
three weeks of time,

669
00:39:25,897 --> 00:39:28,564
rearrange our surgical schedules
and go at the end of next month.

670
00:39:28,666 --> 00:39:31,017
<i>Try as we might to
keep from feeling pain...</i>

671
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:33,703
What's that?

672
00:39:35,107 --> 00:39:39,108
This cute girl's number.
And I can't get it off.

673
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:42,445
And I'm not gonna use
it, I don't want to use it.

674
00:39:45,083 --> 00:39:50,219
But I can't stop wondering if
maybe she wants a baby one day.

675
00:39:59,598 --> 00:40:01,230
I love you.

676
00:40:03,301 --> 00:40:05,368
Everything about you.

677
00:40:06,471 --> 00:40:09,071
But there's this one
thing that I need.

678
00:40:09,173 --> 00:40:11,841
I can't change it, I
can't ask you to change,

679
00:40:11,943 --> 00:40:14,611
- I don't want you to change...
- I can't be the one

680
00:40:14,713 --> 00:40:17,280
that keeps you
from having a baby.

681
00:40:24,956 --> 00:40:26,472
I love you, too.

682
00:40:30,595 --> 00:40:35,064
- And we can keep going.
- But I don't know
where we're going.

683
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:40,286
Come here.

684
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:51,397
<i>Sometimes, it's
just unavoidable.</i>

685
00:40:52,467 --> 00:40:54,467
God, what are we gonna do?

686
00:40:57,672 --> 00:41:00,940
Well, I'm gonna get
my stuff together.

687
00:41:02,344 --> 00:41:03,660
Oh...

688
00:41:06,931 --> 00:41:08,614
And what? We'll just...

689
00:41:10,001 --> 00:41:12,435
We'll see each other at work.

690
00:41:14,589 --> 00:41:17,090
I'm so sorry!

691
00:41:17,192 --> 00:41:19,158
I love you.

692
00:41:20,362 --> 00:41:23,796
Me, too. Me, too.

693
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:28,134
<i>Sometimes, that's
the only thing left.</i>

694
00:41:43,418 --> 00:41:46,352
- Thanks. This was a good idea.
- No talking.

695
00:41:55,013 --> 00:41:57,714
- You shanked it.
- No talking.

696
00:42:04,322 --> 00:42:06,556
<i>Just feeling.</i>
