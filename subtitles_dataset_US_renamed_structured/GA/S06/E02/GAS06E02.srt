1
00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:05,270
<i>The dictionary defines grief as:</i>

2
00:00:05,373 --> 00:00:11,343
<i>"Keen mental suffering or
distress over affliction or loss;</i>

3
00:00:11,445 --> 00:00:15,214
<i>sharp sorrow; painful regret."</i>

4
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:19,651
<i>As surgeons, as scientists,</i>

5
00:00:19,753 --> 00:00:22,921
<i>we're taught to learn
from and rely on books,</i>

6
00:00:23,024 --> 00:00:27,075
<i>on definitions, on definitives.</i>

7
00:00:27,177 --> 00:00:32,280
<i>But in life, strict
definitions rarely apply.</i>

8
00:00:32,382 --> 00:00:36,218
<i>In life, grief can look
like a lot of things</i>

9
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,455
<i>that bear little resemblance
to "sharp sorrow".</i>

10
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:49,114
"You're not missing much.
New York smells like pee."

11
00:00:49,216 --> 00:00:53,201
God, I hate them.

12
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:57,639
More pain? Your CT
results should be back soon.

13
00:00:57,741 --> 00:00:59,791
I'm fine.

14
00:01:00,694 --> 00:01:02,994
You should go home tonight.

15
00:01:03,097 --> 00:01:06,831
You can call off the 24-hour
suicide watch, you know. Honestly.

16
00:01:06,934 --> 00:01:09,351
I'm better now. I am.

17
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,773
Do you know what I think?

18
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:17,643
I think you're using me to avoid
moving in with your boyfriend.

19
00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:19,961
- Am not.
- I'll make you a deal.

20
00:01:20,063 --> 00:01:23,348
You move in with your boyfriend,
and I'll let you call my mum.

21
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:26,401
- Oh, mean.
- Chicken.

22
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:30,989
OK, Clara, the CT shows
you have an infection

23
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:33,642
in your small bowel,
your colon's inflamed.

24
00:01:33,744 --> 00:01:35,844
It's likely something you
picked up in the water,

25
00:01:35,946 --> 00:01:39,264
but it seems to have
formed an abscess,

26
00:01:39,366 --> 00:01:42,517
which means you
need surgery right away.

27
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:45,253
No.

28
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:49,140
- Uh, if we don't...
- No. No more surgery.

29
00:01:49,242 --> 00:01:51,343
- I'm not being cut open again.
- OK, uh...

30
00:01:51,428 --> 00:01:53,645
- No.
- You just take a minute.

31
00:01:53,747 --> 00:01:58,233
Take a few minutes and I'll
come back and we'll discuss it.

32
00:01:58,335 --> 00:02:03,588
Um... Start her on pre-op
antibiotics and book an OR.

33
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:09,310
What are the options? Can
you give me drugs, can you...?

34
00:02:09,412 --> 00:02:12,798
No. You need surgery.
But it's a simple procedure,

35
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:17,001
- and if it goes as planned...
- My boat ride didn't
go as planned.

36
00:02:17,103 --> 00:02:22,474
So... tell me. Worst case.

37
00:02:25,361 --> 00:02:29,097
Well, worst case is...

38
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:30,960
we'd have to take
out part of your colon

39
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:34,102
- and give you a colostomy bag.
- Colostomy bag?

40
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:36,588
A poo bag, outside your body?

41
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,930
My granddad had
one of those, it was...

42
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:43,294
- No, it's a small possibility.
- No. No poo bag.

43
00:02:43,397 --> 00:02:46,014
- No surgery.
- The infection will kill you.

44
00:02:46,116 --> 00:02:49,350
No! No more surgery.

45
00:02:49,653 --> 00:02:51,403
No.

46
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:59,011
We tried pain meds,
treated him for pyelonephritis,

47
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:02,130
but it could be something
more serious, so we did a CMG.

48
00:03:02,232 --> 00:03:04,800
You did a CMG for a UTI?
Why would you even look for...?

49
00:03:04,902 --> 00:03:07,452
Because we were out of
ideas! The CMG was negative

50
00:03:07,537 --> 00:03:09,905
so we went back to a
possible neurological cause.

51
00:03:10,007 --> 00:03:12,485
If we could get a better look,
if you could give us permission

52
00:03:12,509 --> 00:03:15,594
to get a 3D MRI, we
could maybe, just possibly...

53
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:18,697
This kid's been in the ER four
times in the last three weeks.

54
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:21,133
The pain meds aren't
working. Why can't we...?

55
00:03:21,235 --> 00:03:23,068
- Five thousand dollars, Karev.
- Sir?

56
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:27,188
That's how much you or Dr. Robbins
has to put up to cover that scan.

57
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,624
Otherwise, you can come
with me to my board meeting

58
00:03:29,726 --> 00:03:32,477
this afternoon and explain
why you're running this hospital

59
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:34,646
like it's a charity.

60
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:41,620
- Dude, are you crying?
- I have authority issues.

61
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:43,688
Walk away, Karev.

62
00:03:49,713 --> 00:03:52,247
Where do you get off
killing my patients, Yang?

63
00:03:52,349 --> 00:03:54,349
- Killing?
- You take it upon yourself

64
00:03:54,451 --> 00:03:56,584
to talk that girl out
of life-saving surgery,

65
00:03:56,687 --> 00:03:59,287
- you're killing her.
- I didn't talk her...

66
00:03:59,389 --> 00:04:02,557
She had questions about
the surgery. You left the room.

67
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:06,845
I left the room to give a very
fragile, very distraught patient

68
00:04:06,947 --> 00:04:09,480
time and space to accept
what's being asked of her.

69
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:11,850
Then, and only then
would I have discussed

70
00:04:11,952 --> 00:04:14,319
the possible risks with,
I'm certain, more tact

71
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:16,671
and sensitivity than
you have ever displayed

72
00:04:16,773 --> 00:04:18,724
- in the time I've known you.
- She asked...

73
00:04:18,826 --> 00:04:22,377
I don't care what she asked
you, if she asks you anything else,

74
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:26,081
your only answer will be,
"Let me ask my attending."

75
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:38,709
These are good. Do they
sell these in the cafeteria?

76
00:04:38,812 --> 00:04:39,956
- No.
- No.

77
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,791
Those are the cancer pops.

78
00:04:41,815 --> 00:04:43,831
Why do cancer
people get all the fun?

79
00:04:47,671 --> 00:04:49,070
How do you feel, Iz?

80
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:52,524
Not looking forward to the
hurling, but I feel OK, I feel good.

81
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:54,693
Bailey's on some
sort of rampage.

82
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:57,996
I think it's Post-O'Malley
Stress Disorder.

83
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:02,917
- She's not dealing with grief.
- Sounds like Owen's shrink.

84
00:05:03,019 --> 00:05:07,422
Owen's shrink is withholding
sex. So she is grumpy

85
00:05:07,524 --> 00:05:09,808
- and inappropriate.
- Derek doing that, too?

86
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:12,627
- Withholding sex?
- Why would Derek withhold sex?

87
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:16,331
Alex is withholding
everything. It's like he's afraid,

88
00:05:16,433 --> 00:05:19,353
- but I don't know
what he's afraid of.
- Afraid of cancer sex.

89
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:21,514
- Cristina!
- He doesn't want a cancer pop.

90
00:05:21,538 --> 00:05:23,638
- Cristina!
- Just shut the hell up.

91
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:27,191
- I'm not contagious, Cristina.
- I know that.

92
00:05:27,293 --> 00:05:30,228
I would totally
have sex with you.

93
00:05:31,381 --> 00:05:34,432
- Really? Nothing?
- No.

94
00:05:34,534 --> 00:05:36,334
- You don't even want a drawer?
- No.

95
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:39,454
- A toothbrush? Change of panties?
- No.

96
00:05:39,556 --> 00:05:43,658
- Damn. I like your panties.
- I am trying to focus.

97
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,611
I'm becoming a resident
today. I need to focus.

98
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:49,614
I'm across the street from the
hospital. Crash here sometimes,

99
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:53,501
- you'll get
a jump on surgeries.
- OK, OK. Which one?

100
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:56,171
My first day at Mercy West.
I wanna look nice, you know,

101
00:05:56,289 --> 00:06:00,041
serious, talented, hardcore,
not someone you push around.

102
00:06:00,144 --> 00:06:03,895
Nice, but hot. Like me.

103
00:06:05,214 --> 00:06:07,799
- That one.
- Really? I thought this one.

104
00:06:07,901 --> 00:06:10,602
Too hot. Better for
a date. That one.

105
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:13,621
OK. Here. Eh, thanks.

106
00:06:24,284 --> 00:06:26,467
OK. OK.

107
00:06:26,587 --> 00:06:28,402
- Less hot?
- Less hot.

108
00:06:28,504 --> 00:06:30,589
OK. Good.

109
00:06:30,691 --> 00:06:32,256
Thanks. Wish me luck.

110
00:06:32,342 --> 00:06:36,077
Or not luck, 'cause I'm
all talented and hardcore.

111
00:06:36,179 --> 00:06:38,579
You're an attending.
Go kick some ass.

112
00:06:42,786 --> 00:06:45,620
So, um...

113
00:06:45,722 --> 00:06:50,425
Did you forget to mention
that your hot, hardcore ex

114
00:06:50,527 --> 00:06:53,594
sex friend lives
right across the hall?

115
00:06:53,696 --> 00:06:57,899
- Did I?
- Yeah. Yeah, you did.

116
00:06:58,001 --> 00:07:00,252
And it is only under
my tenure as chief

117
00:07:00,354 --> 00:07:04,506
that Seattle Grace has grown
into one of the most renowned,

118
00:07:04,608 --> 00:07:08,543
lauded and sought after
surgical centers in the country.

119
00:07:08,645 --> 00:07:11,179
Replacing me... no.

120
00:07:11,281 --> 00:07:14,348
Disrupting that process
would be an epic mistake.

121
00:07:14,468 --> 00:07:18,019
It is for that reason that
I stand before you today

122
00:07:18,121 --> 00:07:20,021
and say with the
utmost confidence

123
00:07:20,123 --> 00:07:23,808
that there is no one who
understands and cares more

124
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:26,678
about Seattle Grace than...

125
00:07:27,848 --> 00:07:29,948
Than me.

126
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:34,886
Look, this is
ridiculous. I'm fine.

127
00:07:34,988 --> 00:07:38,356
It's a sprained ankle. And I
have a meeting I have to get to.

128
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,909
- Look, I said I'm fine.
- Chief?

129
00:07:41,011 --> 00:07:43,979
- Torres, thank God.
- - You were in a car accident?

130
00:07:44,081 --> 00:07:47,715
Yeah. It was minor. I ran
a red light. I was distracted.

131
00:07:47,817 --> 00:07:51,803
I'm fine. Can we make this quick?
I have a meeting with the board.

132
00:07:51,905 --> 00:07:54,906
Hmm? OK. Let's see.

133
00:07:55,008 --> 00:07:56,608
Ooh!

134
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:59,444
Ooh, I don't know, sir.
This lac looks pretty deep.

135
00:07:59,546 --> 00:08:05,399
You'll definitely need stitches.
And the ankle... Oh, yikes.

136
00:08:05,501 --> 00:08:08,853
- Yeah. You could need surgery.
- It's a sprain, Torres.

137
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:11,789
- You two know each other?
- Yeah.

138
00:08:11,892 --> 00:08:15,176
Dr. Webber and I go way
back. We worked together for...

139
00:08:15,278 --> 00:08:17,322
What was it? Five,
six years? Yeah.

140
00:08:17,346 --> 00:08:19,764
I hate to say it, but you
have to have that lac repaired.

141
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:22,500
Being a teaching hospital,
not to mention Dr. McKee's

142
00:08:22,602 --> 00:08:25,153
first day, I have to
let him work you up,

143
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:27,922
so... You know how
to do sutures, right?

144
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:31,359
- Damn straight.
- Great.

145
00:08:31,461 --> 00:08:32,777
Good seeing you, chief.

146
00:08:34,214 --> 00:08:37,582
She's... She's just kidding
about this being my first day.

147
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:38,983
It's... It's my eighth.

148
00:08:40,704 --> 00:08:42,470
What kind of sutures
are you using?

149
00:08:42,572 --> 00:08:44,183
- Uh... 3-0 nylon.
- No, no, no.

150
00:08:44,207 --> 00:08:46,674
Use DERMABOND. Takes
less time and heals quicker.

151
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:50,111
Yeah, I know, but, like,
budget cuts, you know?

152
00:08:52,566 --> 00:08:56,568
You like working in
this place, Dr... McKee?

153
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,914
- You think
it's a strong program?
- It rocks.

154
00:08:58,938 --> 00:09:01,639
Like, day eight and I'm doing
unsupervised procedures.

155
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:07,212
- Not too shabby.
- Hmm... Not too shabby.

156
00:09:19,426 --> 00:09:21,742
He trained at Northwestern
and then at Harvard.

157
00:09:21,844 --> 00:09:25,980
He grew up five miles away
from here. Not rich, not poor.

158
00:09:26,082 --> 00:09:29,750
Comfortable and well
loved by his parents, but...

159
00:09:29,853 --> 00:09:32,053
itching to do something
more with his life.

160
00:09:32,122 --> 00:09:34,455
Which is when he
enlisted at the age of...

161
00:09:34,557 --> 00:09:36,674
Cristina, this is
not a book report.

162
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:42,074
I'm trying to explain to Dr. Wyatt
that I know things about you.

163
00:09:42,098 --> 00:09:44,148
- Cristina...
- Wait! He knows things about

164
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,268
me, too, if that's what you were
gonna say. We talk all the time.

165
00:09:48,738 --> 00:09:49,978
Honey?

166
00:09:51,241 --> 00:09:54,659
- "Honey?
- " - Cristina, let me be clear.

167
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:57,796
It's not that I want the two of
you to get to know each other.

168
00:09:57,898 --> 00:10:00,464
It's that I want Owen to
feel comfortable with you.

169
00:10:00,566 --> 00:10:02,183
Oh, he is comfortable with me.

170
00:10:07,123 --> 00:10:11,493
It's fine. You can
talk to her. It's fine.

171
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:15,046
OK, Cristina, um...

172
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:17,315
He talks to you. He's
comfortable with you.

173
00:10:17,417 --> 00:10:20,084
Does he talk to you
about his trauma?

174
00:10:22,605 --> 00:10:25,857
Does Owen talk to
you about the war?

175
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:29,627
Does he talk to you about
the incident between you two?

176
00:10:29,729 --> 00:10:31,012
The choking?

177
00:10:33,749 --> 00:10:37,851
Owen's post-traumatic
stress is fed

178
00:10:37,954 --> 00:10:41,589
by his avoidance of talking
about anything in the war.

179
00:10:41,691 --> 00:10:43,925
In order to improve, to heal,

180
00:10:44,027 --> 00:10:47,228
he's going to have
to start talking about it.

181
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:50,432
To you, and to me.

182
00:10:50,534 --> 00:10:55,737
And my concern is if you
get lost in the lust of it all,

183
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:58,223
he won't have to make a start.

184
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:00,791
He won't have any reason to.

185
00:11:00,893 --> 00:11:04,663
He'll feel that he has everything
he needs, until he doesn't.

186
00:11:06,733 --> 00:11:11,386
So I'm asking you... to wait.

187
00:11:19,262 --> 00:11:23,164
- Finished.
- Read it back to me.

188
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:27,001
"Hi, Mom. Please prepare yourself.
This is gonna be difficult to read.

189
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:29,303
- I've been in an accident."
- That's not what I said.

190
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,505
"I've suffered
terrible injuries..."

191
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:32,874
You can't send that.

192
00:11:32,976 --> 00:11:35,776
"I'm suffering from an infection
which I've refused to treat,

193
00:11:35,878 --> 00:11:38,880
so I'm gonna die soon.
Please come quickly, Mom,

194
00:11:38,982 --> 00:11:40,526
and if I'm gone
before you get here,

195
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:42,261
I wanted to tell you
how much I love you."

196
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:44,852
- Stop it.
- "Thank you for making me

197
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:47,155
- from scratch."
- You bitch! You're a bitch!

198
00:11:47,257 --> 00:11:51,475
I can hit the call button and have
the nurses take you into surgery.

199
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:54,240
- Or I can hit send. That's the deal.
- I will sue you.

200
00:11:54,264 --> 00:11:56,230
I will sue you
and this hospital.

201
00:11:56,332 --> 00:11:58,852
No, you won't. You'll be dead.

202
00:12:00,787 --> 00:12:02,336
Please.

203
00:12:03,323 --> 00:12:06,173
Please.

204
00:12:07,511 --> 00:12:09,460
Hello, the nurses
said you called for me?

205
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,646
This is Andy.

206
00:12:11,748 --> 00:12:13,163
Andy Michaelson.

207
00:12:13,266 --> 00:12:15,266
I'm sorry, have I
treated you before?

208
00:12:15,368 --> 00:12:18,686
Dr. Arizona Robbins referred us.

209
00:12:19,255 --> 00:12:20,939
Oh, Andy!

210
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:24,092
- You're the kid with the...
- With the thing no one
can diagnose?

211
00:12:24,194 --> 00:12:27,812
- Yeah, that's us.
- Dr. Robbins sent you here

212
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:31,399
- to Mercy West because...?
- These are copies of Andy's
paperwork

213
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:32,781
from Seattle Grace.

214
00:12:34,621 --> 00:12:36,404
We don't sleep anymore.

215
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:40,641
We basically go to the hospital.
I don't know what else to do.

216
00:12:40,744 --> 00:12:42,660
- I feel like a terrible mother.
- Mom.

217
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:46,548
I feel like a terrible mother
because I'm supposed to...

218
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:49,567
I'm supposed to do something.
And I can't, you know?

219
00:12:49,669 --> 00:12:53,504
I didn't go to medical school.
I majored in freaking history.

220
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:56,724
You're the doctors, you
know? You're the doctors.

221
00:12:56,826 --> 00:12:59,376
And, basically, all we've
been doing up to this point,

222
00:12:59,479 --> 00:13:02,963
any of us, is getting my
kid strung out on pain meds.

223
00:13:03,065 --> 00:13:04,899
- Mom, stop.
- I can't, Andy!

224
00:13:05,001 --> 00:13:07,084
I can't stop.

225
00:13:08,054 --> 00:13:10,188
We don't sleep.

226
00:13:10,756 --> 00:13:12,556
He can't sleep.

227
00:13:12,658 --> 00:13:15,909
We can't sleep.

228
00:13:16,011 --> 00:13:17,878
And I'm scared.

229
00:13:17,998 --> 00:13:23,951
And Dr. Robbins said that what she needs
you to give us is a 3D MRI of his spine.

230
00:13:24,054 --> 00:13:25,214
She said you wouldn't want to

231
00:13:25,238 --> 00:13:28,005
'cause there's no
indication or whatever,

232
00:13:28,107 --> 00:13:30,774
but she says that's
what he needs.

233
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:33,911
Please.

234
00:13:34,014 --> 00:13:37,598
I can't be this useless. And
you know what? Neither can you.

235
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:40,918
Please.

236
00:13:43,806 --> 00:13:45,873
That's a lot of
necrotic small bowel.

237
00:13:45,975 --> 00:13:49,611
- Can you save any of it?
- - Yesterday, I could have.

238
00:13:49,713 --> 00:13:53,013
Yesterday, this would've
been a simple drainage.

239
00:13:53,116 --> 00:13:56,484
But that was before
Dr. Yang threatened my patient

240
00:13:56,586 --> 00:13:59,053
with a colostomy
that, thankfully, will not

241
00:13:59,155 --> 00:14:02,973
be necessary because it did
not actually involve the colon.

242
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,829
- How can I help?
- Oh, you've done enough.

243
00:14:16,172 --> 00:14:17,304
She asked me a question.

244
00:14:17,406 --> 00:14:19,607
I was right to
answer it. I did my job!

245
00:14:19,709 --> 00:14:23,127
A patient asked me to disclose
the risks of a surgical procedure,

246
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:26,897
and I am required by
law and my oath to do so.

247
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:32,119
If you know a way to sugar-coat
a colostomy bag, I'd like to hear it.

248
00:14:32,221 --> 00:14:36,440
If you know a more respectful way
to speak to an attending surgeon,

249
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:40,644
I'd like to hear that! Until
you do, you don't talk to me.

250
00:14:40,747 --> 00:14:42,947
You're off my service.

251
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:46,767
OK, seriously? What
is your problem?

252
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:58,196
More suits? It's
freaking people out.

253
00:14:58,298 --> 00:15:03,484
Talk of downsizing, corporate takeover,
rumors that Webber's jumping ship.

254
00:15:03,586 --> 00:15:07,004
You've got the chief's
ear. What's he got planned?

255
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:09,440
- Here's the test.
- Thank you.

256
00:15:10,793 --> 00:15:13,627
He's retiring. They're
making me chief.

257
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:15,596
- No!
- Yeah.

258
00:15:15,698 --> 00:15:17,931
- Really?
- Yeah.

259
00:15:18,033 --> 00:15:20,735
- Really? Wow.
- Yep. Mm-hmm.

260
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:23,003
I mean, the chief never
said anything to me.

261
00:15:23,105 --> 00:15:25,789
I would've fought
you hard for that.

262
00:15:25,891 --> 00:15:28,059
But hell, I guess if
that's what he wants,

263
00:15:28,161 --> 00:15:30,361
congratulations are in order.

264
00:15:34,366 --> 00:15:35,766
Wait. That was...

265
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:38,836
- You're messing with me?
- It's just too easy.

266
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,771
You got a mean
streak, you know that?

267
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:42,393
- Yeah.
- Mean!

268
00:15:44,627 --> 00:15:49,380
- Seriously, what's going on?
- I have no idea.

269
00:15:56,672 --> 00:16:00,725
Oh... I have wine.
White and red.

270
00:16:00,827 --> 00:16:03,811
And I have cigarettes.
Which is awful, I know.

271
00:16:03,913 --> 00:16:08,081
I only smoke them very occasionally
when I know I'm gonna be in trouble.

272
00:16:08,183 --> 00:16:09,884
- Like now.
- It was inappropriate.

273
00:16:09,986 --> 00:16:12,520
Not to mention
manipulative and stupid.

274
00:16:12,622 --> 00:16:14,655
- You smoke?
- I know. Listen, I know.

275
00:16:14,758 --> 00:16:17,125
You have every right to
be mad, I ran out of options.

276
00:16:17,227 --> 00:16:19,444
It's expensive! There
was no indication!

277
00:16:19,545 --> 00:16:22,729
There's a reason
Webber turned you down!

278
00:16:22,831 --> 00:16:26,517
- So you didn't do it.
- Of course I did it, Arizona.

279
00:16:26,619 --> 00:16:29,820
- Thank you.
- No. Don't thank me yet.

280
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:32,657
- The scan didn't show anything.
- What? Come on. Nothing?

281
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:34,391
No.

282
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:37,273
That looks a little funny to me.

283
00:16:37,297 --> 00:16:40,831
I thought so too, but the
radiologist said it's normal.

284
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:43,517
OK, all right. Here.

285
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:48,389
Was there anything
peculiar about his H&P?

286
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,712
Oh!

287
00:16:59,736 --> 00:17:02,069
Sorry! Sorry!

288
00:17:03,005 --> 00:17:05,473
- Sorry! Sorry, we're sorry.
- Sorry!

289
00:17:05,575 --> 00:17:08,776
We'll be sure to
clean the countertop.

290
00:17:08,878 --> 00:17:11,646
You didn't used
to do this before.

291
00:17:11,748 --> 00:17:13,580
And now it's kind
of all the time.

292
00:17:13,683 --> 00:17:16,751
- Everywhere. And...
- You know, it's...

293
00:17:16,853 --> 00:17:18,586
We're married now.

294
00:17:18,688 --> 00:17:21,923
Things have changed a little.
But sorry about the countertop.

295
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:26,878
So you guys are... That's it?
The Post-it? That's for real?

296
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:29,714
Yeah. That's for real.

297
00:17:41,861 --> 00:17:45,245
- What are you reading?
- This patient I'm trying
to diagnose.

298
00:17:45,347 --> 00:17:48,482
- It's driving me nuts.
- So take a break. I miss you.

299
00:17:48,584 --> 00:17:53,304
- Well... I'm right here.
- No, you're not.

300
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:55,768
You're here, but you're
not here, and I miss you.

301
00:17:55,792 --> 00:17:58,759
Iz, come on, I'm trying to work.

302
00:18:03,366 --> 00:18:05,566
I'm wishing for a brain tumor.

303
00:18:06,702 --> 00:18:08,881
I'm wishing, all the time,
for a giant tumor that

304
00:18:08,905 --> 00:18:12,873
would press on my brain and
make me hallucinate George.

305
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:16,544
So that I could
talk to him again.

306
00:18:16,646 --> 00:18:19,446
So I could laugh
with him again. I...

307
00:18:21,918 --> 00:18:23,884
I miss him.

308
00:18:23,986 --> 00:18:26,353
So much. I miss
him all the time.

309
00:18:26,455 --> 00:18:29,456
And I just want to feel
better, even for a minute.

310
00:18:29,559 --> 00:18:32,793
I just want to be a person who
isn't wishing for a brain tumor.

311
00:18:32,895 --> 00:18:35,362
Just for one minute.

312
00:18:35,464 --> 00:18:38,098
And I can't drink because
of the cancer meds,

313
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:42,886
I don't do drugs, I can't even
work. I don't have any distractions.

314
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:45,889
I'm sad.

315
00:18:45,992 --> 00:18:48,232
And I miss George. So please...

316
00:18:49,529 --> 00:18:53,097
Please, come inside
and help me feel better.

317
00:18:57,436 --> 00:18:59,469
"I miss George."

318
00:18:59,571 --> 00:19:02,873
Nice. Real seductive.

319
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,763
Oh. Hey. Is Mark around?

320
00:19:31,787 --> 00:19:34,255
- He's in the shower.
- Oh, thanks.

321
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:40,378
Have you heard anything about
what's happening with the chief?

322
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,097
There's all these rumors
floating around Mercy West,

323
00:19:43,198 --> 00:19:46,562
like he might be coming to work
for us. That'd not go well for me.

324
00:19:46,586 --> 00:19:48,719
I haven't heard. I'll
check with Derek.

325
00:19:48,821 --> 00:19:51,155
- Thanks.
- Can you hand me the shampoo?

326
00:19:51,257 --> 00:19:53,491
- Thank you.
- Mmm-hmm.

327
00:19:58,631 --> 00:20:00,815
Are you really gay?

328
00:20:00,917 --> 00:20:05,987
Like, how gay are you
on a scale of one to...

329
00:20:06,089 --> 00:20:08,972
gay? 'Cause that's my boyfriend.

330
00:20:09,075 --> 00:20:12,293
In the shower. My hot,
hot, naked boyfriend.

331
00:20:12,395 --> 00:20:14,945
And I... How gay are you?

332
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,548
I'm sorry. It's...

333
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:19,478
I've known Mark a while and...

334
00:20:19,502 --> 00:20:21,985
But I'll... try not
to do that again.

335
00:20:22,087 --> 00:20:24,399
The naked in the shower thing.

336
00:20:24,423 --> 00:20:26,940
Or the you half-naked
in the hallway thing.

337
00:20:27,042 --> 00:20:29,743
'Cause even if you
really are gay, he's not.

338
00:20:29,846 --> 00:20:32,746
And... and you're hot.

339
00:20:37,886 --> 00:20:40,198
He doesn't look at
my boobs anymore.

340
00:20:40,222 --> 00:20:44,775
The first thing he used to look
at when I walked in anywhere

341
00:20:44,877 --> 00:20:47,345
was my boobs.

342
00:20:47,447 --> 00:20:50,597
He doesn't look anymore.
Not since he met you.

343
00:20:51,767 --> 00:20:54,935
- OK?
- OK.

344
00:21:00,442 --> 00:21:03,961
- Shepherd?
- You're a hard man to track down.

345
00:21:04,063 --> 00:21:06,597
- I'm busy, as you know.
- Scoping out Mercy West?

346
00:21:06,699 --> 00:21:10,968
You planning on jumping ship?
Because I assume, as a friend,

347
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:13,132
you'd tell me anything
I need to know.

348
00:21:13,156 --> 00:21:16,841
- Those are rumors, Derek.
- There are a lot of rumors.

349
00:21:16,943 --> 00:21:18,603
And Jennings isn't
answering my calls.

350
00:21:18,627 --> 00:21:20,477
Why are you calling Jennings?

351
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:23,296
I told you I'd fill you in when
there was something to tell.

352
00:21:23,399 --> 00:21:25,165
You feel the need to
go behind my back...

353
00:21:25,267 --> 00:21:28,585
Behind your back?
Behind your back?

354
00:21:28,687 --> 00:21:31,322
I'm the one who's got your back.

355
00:21:31,424 --> 00:21:33,173
Don't you forget that.

356
00:21:35,978 --> 00:21:37,978
- Dr. Shepherd, have a minute?
- Yes. For what?

357
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:41,766
A kid with a tethered spinal
cord. I thought tethered spinal cord.

358
00:21:41,868 --> 00:21:45,536
You're not gonna see it on there.
I need another test to confirm.

359
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:47,772
A tethered cord's rare.
He have spina bifida?

360
00:21:47,873 --> 00:21:50,274
- No.
- Lower back lesions? Hyperreflexia?

361
00:21:50,376 --> 00:21:52,454
No and no. But the pain
is aggravated when he

362
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:55,062
extends or flexes his spine. I
know what you're gonna say.

363
00:21:55,164 --> 00:21:58,176
A tethered cord shows up on
the MRI. But what if it didn't?

364
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,885
What if what this kid
needs is not an MRI,

365
00:22:00,987 --> 00:22:04,421
- but a specific CT myelogram.
- Maybe.

366
00:22:04,523 --> 00:22:06,407
- Order one.
- I can't.

367
00:22:06,509 --> 00:22:10,211
Because if I did, I'd get
fired and I really like my job.

368
00:22:10,313 --> 00:22:13,964
- Did the chief deny
that request?
- Several times.

369
00:22:14,067 --> 00:22:16,367
You should've led with
the part about the chief.

370
00:22:16,469 --> 00:22:17,651
Come on.

371
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:19,803
- You're doing great.
- You're up, girl.

372
00:22:19,905 --> 00:22:23,173
Who'd think standing could be
so hard? You're doing awesome.

373
00:22:23,275 --> 00:22:24,636
- Awesome.
- Put me down.

374
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:27,378
- Let's go a couple seconds...
- Put me down.

375
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:31,114
- That was great.
- Take a sec and
go again for me, OK?

376
00:22:31,217 --> 00:22:32,949
- No.
- I know, Clara.

377
00:22:33,052 --> 00:22:35,569
This is where the
hard part begins.

378
00:22:48,801 --> 00:22:51,001
McDreamy.

379
00:22:51,103 --> 00:22:53,871
- I'm sorry?
- I get it now.

380
00:22:53,973 --> 00:22:56,924
The whole McDreamy
thing. I didn't get it before,

381
00:22:57,026 --> 00:22:59,243
but now... I get it.

382
00:23:00,346 --> 00:23:02,591
You know they
call you that, right?

383
00:23:02,615 --> 00:23:03,997
Yes.

384
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,612
I'm involved, by the way,
in case you thought I was

385
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:10,070
coming onto you,
because I was not.

386
00:23:10,172 --> 00:23:12,184
Plus, I heard that
you got married.

387
00:23:12,208 --> 00:23:15,609
- So congratulations.
- Yes, thank you.

388
00:23:15,711 --> 00:23:17,871
You wrote some hokey
crap on a Post-it note

389
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:19,296
in the resident's lounge.

390
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:22,233
Sorry, but until you're
sweating it out in a morning coat

391
00:23:22,335 --> 00:23:24,518
with a ball of white
taffeta coming at you,

392
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:25,953
you're not really married.

393
00:23:26,055 --> 00:23:29,923
OK. Well, I've consummated mine.
I consummate mine all the time.

394
00:23:30,025 --> 00:23:33,143
How's that going for
you, Karev? Girls talk.

395
00:23:33,246 --> 00:23:36,680
You might wanna consider that
next time you judge my Post-it.

396
00:23:43,472 --> 00:23:45,522
I haven't cried yet.

397
00:23:46,858 --> 00:23:49,176
I'm using work and
sex as a distraction.

398
00:23:49,278 --> 00:23:52,095
And I think it's working for me.

399
00:23:53,131 --> 00:23:55,732
Have you seen the girl, Amanda,

400
00:23:55,835 --> 00:24:00,186
sitting outside the hospital
on that bench all day long?

401
00:24:00,288 --> 00:24:05,008
I miss sex. I miss it so much.

402
00:24:09,298 --> 00:24:11,115
What?

403
00:24:11,617 --> 00:24:13,450
Mer!

404
00:24:13,552 --> 00:24:15,953
I'm worried about
Clara. She's depressed.

405
00:24:16,055 --> 00:24:18,199
Like, a whole new
level of depressed.

406
00:24:18,223 --> 00:24:20,975
- I don't know what to do.
- You talking about Ceviche?

407
00:24:21,077 --> 00:24:22,309
That...

408
00:24:23,696 --> 00:24:26,897
Oh, my God! That's...
That is so rude!

409
00:24:26,999 --> 00:24:30,434
Ceviche? That is
so... That's rude.

410
00:24:30,536 --> 00:24:32,369
That... That is so rude!

411
00:24:36,408 --> 00:24:41,328
- Anyone else I can offend?
- A tethered spinal cord?

412
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:44,298
One of the threads in his
cord is attached to his tailbone.

413
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,400
Normally, the spinal
cord is free at the end,

414
00:24:46,502 --> 00:24:49,586
but with it attached, when
you grew, it started pulling.

415
00:24:49,688 --> 00:24:53,891
- Thus, the excruciating pain.
- Can we fix it? Is it fixable?

416
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:56,560
- Microsurgery.
- I'll snip the tethered cord,

417
00:24:56,662 --> 00:24:58,863
and he'll be free of pain.

418
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,450
She's not normally like this.

419
00:25:03,552 --> 00:25:05,819
Before all this, she
was like a normal mom.

420
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:10,424
- Oh!
- Andy, this is a normal mom.

421
00:25:17,066 --> 00:25:18,765
Are we waiting for Dr. Swender?

422
00:25:18,867 --> 00:25:22,753
No. Dr. Swender has
handed you off to me.

423
00:25:23,806 --> 00:25:27,707
What are you, like, second year?

424
00:25:29,378 --> 00:25:32,946
- Third.
- That's, um...

425
00:25:33,048 --> 00:25:34,648
Can we page
Dr. Swender or something?

426
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:37,150
Stevens, this is a good thing.

427
00:25:37,252 --> 00:25:40,587
It is. You still have cancer.

428
00:25:40,689 --> 00:25:43,908
But not enough to interest
Dr. Swender anymore.

429
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:49,579
- It is a good thing.
- You're saying I have
JV cancer.

430
00:25:49,681 --> 00:25:52,466
I'm saying your mets
have shrunk way down,

431
00:25:52,568 --> 00:25:53,951
and there are no new ones.

432
00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:56,334
Your protocol is
working very effectively.

433
00:25:58,473 --> 00:26:03,560
Stevens, this is about
as good as the news gets.

434
00:26:03,662 --> 00:26:07,697
- Um... So, what now?
- We're gonna use
the port in your chest

435
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,333
to continue with your
IL-2 regimen for now.

436
00:26:10,435 --> 00:26:14,154
And we'll continue monitoring
the progression of your disease

437
00:26:14,256 --> 00:26:17,641
with PET scans every
three to six months.

438
00:26:17,743 --> 00:26:20,861
Is there some kind of
timeline on this, or...?

439
00:26:20,963 --> 00:26:24,114
Your wife is living
with cancer, Dr. Karev.

440
00:26:24,216 --> 00:26:26,511
Right now, the cancer
has stopped growing.

441
00:26:26,535 --> 00:26:30,904
With a cancer this aggressive,
that's pretty stunning success.

442
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:35,993
There's no timeline.
There's just... We watch it.

443
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:40,948
We wait. We hope it
doesn't start to grow again.

444
00:26:44,553 --> 00:26:48,505
- That's it?
- That's it.

445
00:26:59,435 --> 00:27:02,586
I see contractions
in the anterior tibialis.

446
00:27:02,688 --> 00:27:04,608
OK. That's the nerve
root, not the filum.

447
00:27:04,723 --> 00:27:08,208
Bipolars and the
micro scissors, please.

448
00:27:11,813 --> 00:27:15,866
- Wanna make the cut?
- No. I don't need to.

449
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:19,103
Without you, this kid would've
been a chronic pain patient,

450
00:27:19,205 --> 00:27:20,854
possibly addicted to pain meds.

451
00:27:20,956 --> 00:27:23,623
He owes his
entire future to you.

452
00:27:24,793 --> 00:27:26,176
You should make the cut.

453
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:31,414
OK?

454
00:27:34,386 --> 00:27:36,486
OK.

455
00:27:36,588 --> 00:27:38,371
Put the scissor in...

456
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:45,378
There. Nicely done.

457
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:52,436
Dr. Grey says you're still
refusing your physical therapy.

458
00:27:52,538 --> 00:27:54,721
Now, I understand it's hard.

459
00:27:54,823 --> 00:27:56,384
But you have to work
these muscles now

460
00:27:56,408 --> 00:28:01,027
or they will atrophy
and heal incorrectly.

461
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:05,949
Clara, you gotta do the work.
You got to do the work now.

462
00:28:12,374 --> 00:28:15,942
I know what it is to not want
to live, to wish you'd died,

463
00:28:16,044 --> 00:28:20,981
to lose everything, to not
want to call your mother.

464
00:28:21,083 --> 00:28:23,767
Believe it or not, I know
exactly what that is.

465
00:28:23,869 --> 00:28:26,803
I have been there.

466
00:28:26,905 --> 00:28:29,105
I am back now.

467
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:35,328
As impossible as
it felt, eventually,

468
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:36,929
I came back.

469
00:28:37,032 --> 00:28:41,084
And so can you. You
have got to do the work.

470
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:54,242
- You have to get her
admitted to Psych.
- Committed?

471
00:28:54,266 --> 00:28:55,743
You want me to
have her committed?

472
00:28:55,767 --> 00:28:58,096
Nothing more we can do.
You have to make that call.

473
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,320
People are calling
you "Ceviche".

474
00:29:00,422 --> 00:29:02,522
- Dr. Grey.
- That's... You know,

475
00:29:02,624 --> 00:29:06,526
you can't go out like that,
with people calling you Ceviche.

476
00:29:06,628 --> 00:29:09,179
- Ceviche?
- Yeah. It's a meal.

477
00:29:09,281 --> 00:29:12,382
It's Peruvian, I think.

478
00:29:13,218 --> 00:29:15,819
It's chopped up fish.

479
00:29:24,479 --> 00:29:29,750
That's really
horrible, isn't it?

480
00:29:29,852 --> 00:29:32,586
It is. It's...

481
00:29:32,688 --> 00:29:34,638
It's horrible.

482
00:29:40,045 --> 00:29:42,095
It's horrible!

483
00:29:48,954 --> 00:29:50,871
I didn't expect this.

484
00:29:50,973 --> 00:29:55,358
They say cancer, they say
stage four, you expect to die.

485
00:29:55,461 --> 00:29:57,460
And then you start
thinking, "Maybe I can kick it.

486
00:29:57,562 --> 00:30:02,966
- I'll be the miracle."
- Well, you are the miracle.

487
00:30:03,068 --> 00:30:05,719
I'm still living with cancer.

488
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:09,889
You know, I just...
You don't expect that.

489
00:30:12,944 --> 00:30:14,961
Isn't that the girl
that George saved?

490
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:17,196
Oh, Amanda.

491
00:30:17,299 --> 00:30:20,017
- Yeah.
- What is she doing here?

492
00:30:20,119 --> 00:30:25,355
Oh, she sits there.
Every day, all day.

493
00:30:25,457 --> 00:30:28,442
- For God's sakes.
- Where... What...?

494
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:35,148
Get up. I mean it, get up.

495
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:37,267
Get up!

496
00:30:37,369 --> 00:30:41,221
Now, go get a life.

497
00:30:43,775 --> 00:30:45,055
I can't.

498
00:30:47,863 --> 00:30:51,030
George was a surgeon,
he had a purpose.

499
00:30:51,132 --> 00:30:56,069
He wanted to save lives and
now he doesn't get the chance.

500
00:30:56,171 --> 00:30:58,505
Now, he doesn't get the
chance to do anything anymore,

501
00:30:58,607 --> 00:31:02,860
but you do. You could go to
medical school, you know?

502
00:31:02,962 --> 00:31:04,878
You could hang out
with your freaking friends.

503
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:06,079
I don't care what.

504
00:31:06,181 --> 00:31:08,715
Just go do something
with your life.

505
00:31:08,817 --> 00:31:11,902
Because you have one, you lived!

506
00:31:12,004 --> 00:31:13,770
You lived and George didn't!

507
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:15,922
And I know...

508
00:31:18,259 --> 00:31:22,395
I know that that feels horrible

509
00:31:22,498 --> 00:31:26,332
and shocking and terrifying.

510
00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:29,836
But you lived.

511
00:31:31,507 --> 00:31:34,941
So go live your freaking life.

512
00:31:37,879 --> 00:31:40,146
I... I don't know how.

513
00:31:40,248 --> 00:31:42,966
Nobody does.

514
00:31:43,068 --> 00:31:46,469
Nobody knows how.

515
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:49,639
But, God, have enough
respect for George to figure it out.

516
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:52,642
'Cause if I see you sitting
on this bench ever again,

517
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:56,179
I will kick your ass
from here to Sunday.

518
00:32:15,033 --> 00:32:16,700
I can't get back
on Bailey's service.

519
00:32:16,802 --> 00:32:18,367
She's still not
even looking at me.

520
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:21,270
Give her time. She was
close with O'Malley...

521
00:32:21,372 --> 00:32:24,107
It's not about O'Malley. She's
mad at me about Ceviche.

522
00:32:24,209 --> 00:32:27,010
- You got to stop that.
- Ceviche?

523
00:32:27,112 --> 00:32:29,863
- It's a patient.
- A boating accident victim.

524
00:32:29,965 --> 00:32:34,200
She thinks it's OK to call her
a seafood dish. Is that OK?

525
00:32:34,302 --> 00:32:37,721
- Well, it's... pretty dark.
- Come on. I'm dark?

526
00:32:37,823 --> 00:32:41,658
I'm not the one going around
choking people in their sleep.

527
00:32:49,434 --> 00:32:51,417
Too soon?

528
00:32:57,158 --> 00:33:00,026
I'm not the guy going around
choking people in their sleep.

529
00:33:00,128 --> 00:33:02,962
- I know.
- It was a dream. I...

530
00:33:04,433 --> 00:33:08,334
I can't remember what I
was dreaming about, but...

531
00:33:08,437 --> 00:33:10,804
I was trying to
save my own life.

532
00:33:13,275 --> 00:33:15,542
I wasn't trying to hurt you.

533
00:33:19,047 --> 00:33:21,715
I was...

534
00:33:21,817 --> 00:33:23,900
I was fighting for my life.

535
00:33:30,342 --> 00:33:32,141
OK.

536
00:33:35,481 --> 00:33:37,581
You made a start.

537
00:33:41,052 --> 00:33:43,236
You made a start.

538
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:52,195
- You have it, you have it.
- - You've got this.

539
00:33:56,017 --> 00:33:58,385
- Yeah, girl!
- I did it.

540
00:33:58,487 --> 00:34:00,870
- You did it.
- I did it.

541
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:06,593
Lexie?

542
00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:09,062
Will you call my mum?

543
00:34:10,632 --> 00:34:13,466
Yeah. Yeah.

544
00:34:15,687 --> 00:34:17,804
OK, come on. Come on.

545
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:23,427
You got it!

546
00:34:23,529 --> 00:34:26,462
<i>Grief may be a thing
we all have in common...</i>

547
00:34:27,932 --> 00:34:30,733
<i>but it looks different
on everyone.</i>

548
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:39,776
Hey.

549
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:50,136
<i>It isn't just death
we have to grieve.</i>

550
00:34:50,238 --> 00:34:53,206
<i>It's life. It's loss.</i>

551
00:34:53,308 --> 00:34:55,542
<i>It's change.</i>

552
00:34:57,612 --> 00:34:58,789
<i>And when we wonder why</i>

553
00:34:58,813 --> 00:35:01,614
<i>it has to suck so
much sometimes,</i>

554
00:35:01,716 --> 00:35:05,919
<i>has to hurt so bad, the
thing we gotta try to remember</i>

555
00:35:06,021 --> 00:35:07,553
<i>is that it can turn on a dime.</i>

556
00:35:13,628 --> 00:35:16,245
- What is this?
- Take off your pants.

557
00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:19,882
Iz, Iz...

558
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:23,320
Be my husband.

559
00:35:23,422 --> 00:35:26,238
Get undressed, get
into bed and hold me.

560
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:29,643
I don't know what you're
so mad about and scared of

561
00:35:29,745 --> 00:35:32,762
because you won't talk
to me, but I'm scared, too.

562
00:35:32,864 --> 00:35:36,783
I can't... If you won't...

563
00:35:36,885 --> 00:35:40,353
If we're gonna have any chance
at a life together, I need you.

564
00:35:40,455 --> 00:35:42,421
Please.

565
00:35:43,825 --> 00:35:45,842
You died in my arms.

566
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:49,512
You died in my arms!
You freaking died,

567
00:35:49,614 --> 00:35:54,100
and you left instructions that I
wasn't allowed to save your life!

568
00:35:54,202 --> 00:35:58,004
You want to know what I'm
scared of? I'm scared of everything!

569
00:35:58,106 --> 00:36:00,873
I'm scared to move!
I'm scared to breathe!

570
00:36:00,976 --> 00:36:04,227
I'm scared to touch you!

571
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:06,963
I can't lose you.
I won't survive.

572
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:09,072
And that's your fault.

573
00:36:09,117 --> 00:36:11,551
You made me love
you, made me let you in,

574
00:36:11,653 --> 00:36:14,321
and then you freakin'
die in my arms!

575
00:36:18,293 --> 00:36:20,643
<i>That's how you stay alive.</i>

576
00:36:26,484 --> 00:36:29,219
<i>When it hurts so
much you can't breathe,</i>

577
00:36:29,321 --> 00:36:31,521
<i>that's how you survive.</i>

578
00:36:51,526 --> 00:36:52,675
Miranda.

579
00:36:58,132 --> 00:37:00,467
<i>By remembering that one day,</i>

580
00:37:00,569 --> 00:37:05,588
<i>somehow, impossibly,
you won't feel this way.</i>

581
00:37:05,674 --> 00:37:08,174
<i>It won't hurt this much.</i>

582
00:37:18,419 --> 00:37:21,754
I... I am an attending

583
00:37:21,856 --> 00:37:25,608
and I am a single mother

584
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:30,380
and I lost O'Malley and, um...

585
00:37:30,982 --> 00:37:32,916
I just can't.

586
00:37:33,018 --> 00:37:35,818
I can't care anymore.

587
00:37:37,322 --> 00:37:39,822
Stevens is not my child.

588
00:37:39,925 --> 00:37:42,458
O'Malley was not my child.

589
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,728
I have to stop treating...

590
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:50,033
I just have to stop
caring so much.

591
00:37:51,586 --> 00:37:53,419
I can't keep...

592
00:37:53,522 --> 00:37:57,857
feeling like this, not at work.

593
00:37:57,959 --> 00:38:03,963
I have to save the feeling
for my son, who needs it!

594
00:38:05,867 --> 00:38:09,101
I just can't keep
giving it away here.

595
00:38:10,271 --> 00:38:11,655
I can't.

596
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:17,309
I won't.

597
00:38:23,618 --> 00:38:27,453
<i>Grief comes in its
own time for everyone.</i>

598
00:38:29,608 --> 00:38:31,474
<i>In its own way.</i>

599
00:38:34,446 --> 00:38:36,946
<i>So the best we can do,</i>

600
00:38:37,048 --> 00:38:39,315
<i>the best anyone can do...</i>

601
00:38:40,352 --> 00:38:42,802
<i>is try for honesty.</i>

602
00:38:43,822 --> 00:38:46,705
I don't want to hurt you again.

603
00:38:46,808 --> 00:38:48,941
My problems, they're real.

604
00:38:49,043 --> 00:38:51,377
And this... this makes us real.

605
00:38:51,479 --> 00:38:54,247
It makes my problems
your problems.

606
00:38:55,183 --> 00:38:57,217
I'm afraid.

607
00:38:57,318 --> 00:38:59,485
I don't want to hurt you again.

608
00:39:03,391 --> 00:39:05,570
You can sleep in the bathtub.

609
00:39:05,594 --> 00:39:07,726
Wha...

610
00:39:17,856 --> 00:39:21,725
<i>The really crappy thing,
the very worst part of grief,</i>

611
00:39:21,827 --> 00:39:24,594
<i>is that you can't control it.</i>

612
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:31,284
- What are you doing?
- We need the space.

613
00:39:37,909 --> 00:39:39,592
<i>The best we can do</i>

614
00:39:39,694 --> 00:39:43,729
<i>is try to let ourselves
feel it when it comes.</i>

615
00:39:43,831 --> 00:39:46,532
Hey. Ugh... Thank you.

616
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:48,601
I got stuck with
this intern today,

617
00:39:48,703 --> 00:39:51,688
took him four tries to
throw in a central line.

618
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:53,973
Reminded me a little
bit of George, actually,

619
00:39:54,075 --> 00:39:56,559
when he was an intern.

620
00:39:57,562 --> 00:40:00,813
<i>And let it go when we can.</i>

621
00:40:23,537 --> 00:40:25,505
Meredith.

622
00:40:42,807 --> 00:40:44,073
<i>The very worst part</i>

623
00:40:44,175 --> 00:40:47,410
<i>is that the minute
you think you're past it,</i>

624
00:40:47,512 --> 00:40:50,747
<i>it starts all over again.</i>

625
00:40:56,054 --> 00:40:59,155
<i>And always, every time...</i>

626
00:40:59,257 --> 00:41:01,858
George O'Malley died.

627
00:41:04,162 --> 00:41:06,529
<i>It takes your breath away.</i>

628
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:18,541
<i>There are five stages of grief.</i>

629
00:41:18,643 --> 00:41:20,593
<i>They look different
on all of us.</i>

630
00:41:20,695 --> 00:41:22,562
<i>But there are always five.</i>

631
00:41:22,664 --> 00:41:24,864
I know you all have
heard a lot of rumors,

632
00:41:24,966 --> 00:41:27,750
- and I'm sorry for that.
<i>- Denial.</i>

633
00:41:27,852 --> 00:41:29,852
And what I'm about to
say will be hard to hear,

634
00:41:29,938 --> 00:41:31,787
and I'm sorry for that as well.

635
00:41:31,889 --> 00:41:33,005
<i>Anger.</i>

636
00:41:33,107 --> 00:41:37,694
The economic climate
is... You all know what it is.

637
00:41:37,796 --> 00:41:41,764
In the coming weeks,
Seattle Grace Hospital

638
00:41:41,866 --> 00:41:45,551
will be merging with Mercy West.

639
00:41:45,653 --> 00:41:47,203
<i>Bargaining.</i>

640
00:41:47,305 --> 00:41:51,524
I wish I could tell you
you'll all survive the merger,

641
00:41:51,626 --> 00:41:53,959
but there are only so many
jobs. And the board and I

642
00:41:54,061 --> 00:41:55,461
have some tough choices to make.

643
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:59,048
- <i>Depression.</i>
- I'm on your side, people.

644
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:01,618
I'm rooting for
every one of you.

645
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:07,840
All I can say is please,
be at your very best.

646
00:42:17,585 --> 00:42:19,585
<i>Acceptance.</i>
