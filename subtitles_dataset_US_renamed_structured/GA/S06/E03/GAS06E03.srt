1
00:00:02,636 --> 00:00:03,716
<i>Paranoia...</i>

2
00:00:04,572 --> 00:00:06,287
<i>gives you an edge in the OR.</i>

3
00:00:06,389 --> 00:00:10,575
What I realize is that Peds is the
only specialty where I could do it all:

4
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:13,312
Cardio, General, Ortho.

5
00:00:13,414 --> 00:00:15,409
It's like the whole
body is your canvas.

6
00:00:15,433 --> 00:00:18,961
The fact that it's a small canvas
makes it even more challenging.

7
00:00:18,985 --> 00:00:21,687
I have no idea if you have
someone on your service.

8
00:00:21,788 --> 00:00:24,256
But I would love to
witness your artistry.

9
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:26,925
You got this?
You gotta like kids.

10
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:30,312
- I love kids.
- OK. I'll see you on rounds.

11
00:00:30,414 --> 00:00:32,398
Great.

12
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,483
He lost a huge chunk of flesh.

13
00:00:34,585 --> 00:00:35,784
I see down to his mandible.

14
00:00:35,886 --> 00:00:38,587
We'll need Plastics
and an ENT consult.

15
00:00:38,688 --> 00:00:41,423
Left IV looks like it's clotted
off. I need a 16-gauge.

16
00:00:41,525 --> 00:00:43,252
Whoa! What's going on?

17
00:00:43,276 --> 00:00:45,677
It's four in the morning.
Is everyone on call?

18
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:47,440
It's the merger. Everyone's
scared to go home.

19
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:49,292
Don't think the chief
meant people couldn't sleep.

20
00:00:49,316 --> 00:00:50,866
Hard when your
job's on the line.

21
00:00:50,984 --> 00:00:54,920
One of you, get as much
type-specific blood as they'll let you have

22
00:00:55,022 --> 00:00:57,556
- and meet us in surgery.
- I got it!

23
00:00:57,658 --> 00:01:00,542
<i>Surgeons play out worst-case
scenarios in their heads.</i>

24
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:03,339
I talked to Callie last night
about the residents at Mercy West.

25
00:01:03,363 --> 00:01:05,430
She said they don't suck.

26
00:01:05,532 --> 00:01:09,051
You're safe 'cause of Derek,
Izzie's safe 'cause of cancer.

27
00:01:09,153 --> 00:01:12,437
Alex is Bailey's new favorite.
Even George'd have been spared

28
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:15,774
'cause he's Owen's guy.
Cardio has been a revolving door.

29
00:01:15,876 --> 00:01:18,793
- No one's got my back.
- So Arizona is your cover?

30
00:01:18,895 --> 00:01:21,413
She's merger-proof.
She keeps kids alive.

31
00:01:21,515 --> 00:01:23,309
No one likes a dead kid.

32
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:25,028
They're under
anesthesia half the time.

33
00:01:25,052 --> 00:01:26,451
How bad can it be?

34
00:01:26,553 --> 00:01:29,721
<i>You're ready to close,
you got the bleeder.</i>

35
00:01:29,824 --> 00:01:33,659
<i>You know it, but there's that
voice in your head asking...</i>

36
00:01:33,761 --> 00:01:36,762
Sloan and Shepherd are
scrubbing out of surgery in OR Two.

37
00:01:36,864 --> 00:01:38,363
Grab 'em before they leave.

38
00:01:38,466 --> 00:01:40,365
Let me know if you
hear about the merger.

39
00:01:40,468 --> 00:01:42,835
Nurses are always the
last to know, first to go.

40
00:01:42,937 --> 00:01:44,235
<i>What if you didn't?</i>

41
00:01:44,338 --> 00:01:46,838
<i>What if the patient dies and
you could have prevented it?</i>

42
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,723
Oh, Alex.

43
00:01:50,377 --> 00:01:54,813
What do you think? Looks
real, right? My mom sent it to me.

44
00:01:54,915 --> 00:01:57,549
- Well, what are you doing here?
- Working.

45
00:01:57,651 --> 00:02:00,952
Iz, we talked about this. You're
supposed to take another three weeks,

46
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:02,887
- resting up.
- I have to come back now

47
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:04,867
before I don't have a
job to come back to.

48
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:07,251
- Iz...
- I have to show
I'm not gonna die.

49
00:02:07,278 --> 00:02:10,578
Unless I sit alone in that
trailer, then I am gonna die.

50
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,414
- I'm gonna die of boredom.
- Izzie...

51
00:02:12,516 --> 00:02:14,733
Seriously, looks real, right?

52
00:02:14,835 --> 00:02:20,988
If you didn't know I have cancer,
you wouldn't know I have cancer, right?

53
00:02:21,091 --> 00:02:23,425
<i>So you check your
work one more time</i>

54
00:02:23,527 --> 00:02:28,130
<i>before you close. Paranoia
is a surgeon's best friend.</i>

55
00:02:28,232 --> 00:02:31,599
- Karev, what do you got?
- 16-year-old helmeted
dirt bike victim.

56
00:02:31,701 --> 00:02:35,037
GCS 15 reported
before intubation.

57
00:02:35,139 --> 00:02:37,372
OK, on my count.
Ready? One, two, three.

58
00:02:37,474 --> 00:02:41,092
I'm gonna scrub in.

59
00:02:41,195 --> 00:02:43,895
So he announces the merger
and shuts himself in his office

60
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:46,882
- all day and refuses to talk.
- This merger won't affect us.

61
00:02:46,984 --> 00:02:49,835
- It's financial restructuring.
- What do you think it is?

62
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:52,031
Cutting personnel. Prepared
to lose all the good people?

63
00:02:52,055 --> 00:02:55,022
I'm not. He's good to
go. I'll write a consult later.

64
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:56,874
I'm gonna talk to Richard now.

65
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:00,728
You're tired, you're angry,

66
00:03:00,831 --> 00:03:02,564
you'll say something
you'll regret.

67
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:04,967
Get out of here for a while.
Go to the driving range.

68
00:03:05,069 --> 00:03:07,035
- I have surgery in an hour.
- Take a walk.

69
00:03:07,137 --> 00:03:10,339
- Grab Meredith, take a walk.
- Meredith won't leave
the hospital.

70
00:03:10,441 --> 00:03:13,258
None of them will.
Everyone's awaiting word.

71
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,077
Look, don't tell me
Lexie's not worried.

72
00:03:16,179 --> 00:03:18,597
Is he in here? 'Cause
I've got the blood!

73
00:03:21,652 --> 00:03:25,570
No, Lexie's worried.

74
00:03:32,313 --> 00:03:34,291
I think you missed a spot.

75
00:03:34,315 --> 00:03:36,147
You can't tease me
about the blood thing,

76
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,516
because it's not funny.

77
00:03:37,618 --> 00:03:40,334
If it gets back to the chief, I
may as well pack my things.

78
00:03:40,436 --> 00:03:43,739
Stop worrying about the
chief. All this is in your head.

79
00:03:43,841 --> 00:03:47,725
Really? 2002, Milwaukee. Third
Street Hospital merged with St. Anne's.

80
00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:49,638
Thirteen residents were let go.

81
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:52,563
2004, Nashville Women's
absorbed Memorial.

82
00:03:52,665 --> 00:03:55,667
Nine residents were
fired. 2006, Albuquerque.

83
00:03:55,769 --> 00:03:57,302
- OK.
- Nineteen residents.

84
00:03:57,404 --> 00:04:01,172
Whoa, stop. You need
to pull yourself together.

85
00:04:01,274 --> 00:04:05,459
You deserve to
be here. Act like it.

86
00:04:06,497 --> 00:04:07,963
OK.

87
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,411
I meant later, you know,
after you went home

88
00:04:11,435 --> 00:04:13,452
and got some sleep.

89
00:04:16,072 --> 00:04:18,690
You know, we should get
some sleep before rounds.

90
00:04:18,792 --> 00:04:22,026
Sleep is for wimps. Sleep
is for Mercy West residents.

91
00:04:22,129 --> 00:04:25,297
Let's fit in another
trauma before rounds.

92
00:04:26,967 --> 00:04:29,568
Don't say anything
about the wig.

93
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:33,671
I'm back. Yes, I am early,
but whatever. I'm back.

94
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:36,341
I've been gone so long, the
first trauma that comes through,

95
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:39,111
it's mine. Got it?

96
00:04:44,501 --> 00:04:45,712
It's amazing, right?

97
00:04:45,736 --> 00:04:47,176
- What?
- What's amazing?

98
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:50,138
- The wig.
- It looks so real,
I couldn't tell.

99
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,858
Always wanted to be a redhead,
so I thought now's the time.

100
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:55,054
What's wrong with your hair?

101
00:04:55,078 --> 00:04:56,872
It's peach fuzz chemo hair.

102
00:04:56,896 --> 00:04:59,781
I wanted to put my patients at
ease, make them comfortable.

103
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:02,450
She looks like a
Stepford wife. Tell her.

104
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:04,992
She can't handle
it. Just don't stare.

105
00:05:06,356 --> 00:05:08,451
- MVC, who do I have?
- I got it! I can do it!

106
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:10,575
I'm not your chief
resident. Figure it out.

107
00:05:12,012 --> 00:05:15,396
- Karev, let's go.
- Oh.

108
00:05:19,953 --> 00:05:22,421
- You're back.
- I am.

109
00:05:22,523 --> 00:05:25,340
- My mom's whole church
prayed for you.
- Thank you.

110
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:29,543
- It looks really real.
- I know, right?

111
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:33,625
- We need to talk.
- I'm busy right now.

112
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:37,235
- Are you making cuts?
- I said I'm busy.

113
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,520
If you're making
cuts, consult with me.

114
00:05:39,622 --> 00:05:42,140
When appropriate, I'll
consult the people I need to.

115
00:05:42,242 --> 00:05:44,075
I'm not people. I
saved your ass.

116
00:05:44,178 --> 00:05:46,378
When Jennings came
to me, you were done.

117
00:05:46,463 --> 00:05:48,913
- Out of loyalty to you...
- You came to me

118
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:51,349
so you'd look like a good
guy before you stole my job.

119
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:54,252
- Are you making cuts or not?
- I said when I'm ready to tell

120
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:58,306
my staff about decisions I'll be
making, I will! When I'm ready!

121
00:05:58,408 --> 00:06:00,352
So don't come barging
in here like I owe you!

122
00:06:00,376 --> 00:06:03,395
I don't owe you a damn
thing! You work for me.

123
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:06,314
I'm still the chief of
surgery at this hospital.

124
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:08,583
Then start acting like it.

125
00:06:12,189 --> 00:06:15,574
Jodie Crowley, 60-year-old
driver who lost consciousness

126
00:06:15,676 --> 00:06:17,626
and hit a parked
car. Vital signs stable.

127
00:06:17,727 --> 00:06:19,194
Complains of abdominal pain.

128
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:21,062
It wasn't a parked
car. They hit us.

129
00:06:21,164 --> 00:06:24,049
- Sir, who are you?
- Who am I? Who are you?

130
00:06:24,151 --> 00:06:26,167
- He's my son.
- Go in the waiting room.

131
00:06:26,269 --> 00:06:30,338
No! He needs to stay with me.
He's a paranoid schizophrenic.

132
00:06:32,826 --> 00:06:34,325
OK.

133
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:39,580
All right, let's put her
on a gurney on my count.

134
00:06:39,682 --> 00:06:41,733
One, two, three.

135
00:06:45,254 --> 00:06:48,623
Listen. They're trying to get
to me through you. Believe me.

136
00:06:48,725 --> 00:06:52,077
Tom, they're not real. Look
at me. Look at me, honey.

137
00:06:52,179 --> 00:06:54,595
Did you feel dizzy or
light-headed before the crash?

138
00:06:54,698 --> 00:06:59,150
- No, I felt fine.
- Abdominal tenderness. I feel a mass.

139
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,446
I've had it for quite a while.

140
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:02,587
Maybe that caused
me to black out.

141
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:05,139
They're trying to hurt
her. She won't believe me.

142
00:07:05,241 --> 00:07:08,710
Tom, look at me. You
know I wouldn't lie to you.

143
00:07:08,829 --> 00:07:12,130
No. No! You have to believe
me. Someone has to believe me.

144
00:07:12,232 --> 00:07:16,601
Aliens have
impregnated my mother.

145
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:33,284
The chief was spotted five hours ago
in the cafeteria again. Apple and yogurt.

146
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:35,904
Then he met with
Dr. Shepherd, brief and heated.

147
00:07:36,006 --> 00:07:37,739
Drew the blinds.
Probably sleeping.

148
00:07:37,841 --> 00:07:39,819
Speculation. We have no proof.

149
00:07:39,843 --> 00:07:43,311
You'd make a good lawyer.
If this doesn't work out.

150
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,363
Ouch.

151
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:48,682
- OK, Dr. Yang,
ready for rounds?
- Yes. Oh, um...

152
00:07:48,785 --> 00:07:51,269
Continue with your
course of treatment.

153
00:07:51,371 --> 00:07:54,206
Keep me updated
on new developments.

154
00:07:55,692 --> 00:07:58,193
- You don't look ready.
- No, I'm ready.

155
00:07:58,294 --> 00:08:02,464
I looked over your patient charts. I
notice you have a shockwave lithotripsy

156
00:08:02,566 --> 00:08:06,184
scheduled for kidney stones
this morning. I was... um...

157
00:08:06,286 --> 00:08:08,653
I've never done one.
I'm looking forward to it.

158
00:08:08,755 --> 00:08:10,522
OK. Now, you're ready.

159
00:08:10,624 --> 00:08:13,808
- Oh.
- Come on, let's go.

160
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:17,412
OK, how long have
you had the growth?

161
00:08:17,514 --> 00:08:21,416
Can you cover the clock?
The number five bothers him.

162
00:08:21,518 --> 00:08:24,452
Yeah. Can you get
something to cover the clock?

163
00:08:27,991 --> 00:08:29,474
Are those cameras?

164
00:08:29,576 --> 00:08:33,327
Tommy, what do we
need from the store?

165
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:36,064
- Why won't they leave me alone?
- Do we need fruit?

166
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:37,960
Yeah, why won't
you leave me alone?

167
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:43,054
What kind of fruit do we
need? Tom, what kind of fruit?

168
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:49,527
Um... Apples, pears...

169
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:52,781
- strawberries?
- Make a list.

170
00:08:52,883 --> 00:08:55,800
Could you give him a
pencil and some paper?

171
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:59,136
He needs something to
distract him from the voices.

172
00:08:59,239 --> 00:09:00,739
Ma'am, the growth.

173
00:09:00,841 --> 00:09:05,543
Oh, uh... Yeah. I'm sorry.
I've had it for a while.

174
00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:08,813
I've been meaning to get it
checked, but, as you can see,

175
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:13,100
my son's illness
is a full-time job.

176
00:09:16,456 --> 00:09:19,323
Karev, I need you to get
Mr. Crowley's wrist X-rayed

177
00:09:19,425 --> 00:09:23,294
- while I get her up to MRI.
- Can't one of these fetuses
baby-sit?

178
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:26,197
- If that's a triple-A,
I want in.
- I can do the wrist.

179
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:29,701
- Dr. Karev has more experience.
- The patient is paranoid,

180
00:09:29,803 --> 00:09:33,123
and hyper-vigilant. He'll pick up
that Dr. Karev doesn't want to be here.

181
00:09:33,223 --> 00:09:36,741
He may interpret that as
Dr. Karev being out to get him.

182
00:09:39,146 --> 00:09:41,312
I aced my Psych clerkship.

183
00:09:44,818 --> 00:09:46,684
- How'd it go with the chief?
- Hey.

184
00:09:46,787 --> 00:09:48,853
- Richard's not talking to me.
- What? Why?

185
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:51,672
I don't know. He's
just... He's not himself.

186
00:09:51,774 --> 00:09:56,293
- What's he doing?
- He's hiding out. How you holding up?

187
00:09:56,395 --> 00:09:58,295
You've been up
for, like, 36 hours?

188
00:09:58,382 --> 00:10:00,663
Forty-eight. I'm good, actually.

189
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:03,234
I feel like... it's
all gonna be OK.

190
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:09,307
We're all gonna keep our jobs and
be amazing people, live amazing lives.

191
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:12,877
Unstable childhood.
I get calm in a crisis.

192
00:10:12,962 --> 00:10:16,397
- This is a crisis, right?
- I don't know.

193
00:10:16,499 --> 00:10:18,516
I don't know what this is.

194
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:23,288
Oh, look who's coming.

195
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:26,907
Oh, um, Dr. Yang,
have you seen Sage?

196
00:10:27,009 --> 00:10:28,387
She's six.

197
00:10:28,411 --> 00:10:30,005
Light brown hair. Blue eyes.

198
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:31,757
She had a tumor
removed from her belly

199
00:10:31,781 --> 00:10:33,492
so she has a
bandage on her tummy.

200
00:10:33,516 --> 00:10:37,836
Hey, check under the
bed. Maybe she's there.

201
00:10:37,938 --> 00:10:40,533
Her labs are better
than expected.

202
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:42,022
Uh, she's not under the bed.

203
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:46,127
Huh. Whoa. I... Maybe
try the bathroom.

204
00:10:46,245 --> 00:10:49,530
Maybe she slipped in there.

205
00:10:49,632 --> 00:10:51,265
How'd she do last
night, she sleep?

206
00:10:51,367 --> 00:10:53,735
She did. I didn't.

207
00:10:53,837 --> 00:10:55,887
Bathroom's clear.

208
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:58,756
Wait, shh. Shh shh shh.

209
00:10:58,859 --> 00:11:03,494
I think that there's something
coming from your pocket.

210
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:06,513
Is Sage inside your pocket?

211
00:11:08,851 --> 00:11:12,770
No, no. She's hiding here.

212
00:11:12,873 --> 00:11:15,156
Gotta look in your pocket first.

213
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:17,241
No, I don't. I
found you already.

214
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:19,026
I need to check
your incision site.

215
00:11:19,128 --> 00:11:20,495
Don't touch it. It hurts.

216
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:23,715
I bet that Mr. Bear would
like to see Sage's scar.

217
00:11:23,817 --> 00:11:27,752
- Wouldn't you, Mr. Bear?
- Oh, um...

218
00:11:29,656 --> 00:11:34,525
Yes, I would.

219
00:11:39,499 --> 00:11:41,565
Dr. Stevens.

220
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:44,369
Surprised to see you back
so soon. You look great.

221
00:11:44,471 --> 00:11:46,416
- Thank you. So do you.
- How you feeling?

222
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,706
- I feel great. How do you feel?
- What I meant...

223
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:51,242
I know what you mean. I
feel fine. I'm ready to work.

224
00:11:51,344 --> 00:11:53,472
Here is Mr. Trinidad's
latest pre-op labs.

225
00:11:53,496 --> 00:11:55,896
I told him you'd say
hello before the surgery.

226
00:11:55,998 --> 00:11:58,027
Unless there's anything
else I need to know,

227
00:11:58,051 --> 00:11:59,862
I was gonna get
his consent form.

228
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:01,719
That pretty much covers it.

229
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:05,206
- Unless anybody has questions.
- Can you tell us about
the merger?

230
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:09,677
Because I'm having a baby. I
mean, my wife is having a baby.

231
00:12:09,779 --> 00:12:13,648
Resident Megan is having a baby.
I mean, am I gonna lose my job?

232
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:16,217
Right now, I'm concerned
about my patient.

233
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:18,019
You should be, too.

234
00:12:25,862 --> 00:12:30,464
- I just got my hair cut.
- Oh. It looks nice.

235
00:12:30,567 --> 00:12:33,834
The nurse out there with
the red hair is laughing at me.

236
00:12:33,936 --> 00:12:37,021
You tell her I just got it
cut, they cut it too short.

237
00:12:37,124 --> 00:12:40,975
- That's why my ears
are sticking out.
- She's not laughing at you.

238
00:12:43,246 --> 00:12:45,179
How's that feel?

239
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:50,634
It feels like my
hand is falling off.

240
00:12:50,736 --> 00:12:52,370
Feels like...

241
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:56,190
they put something in it
to make my hand fall off.

242
00:12:56,292 --> 00:12:59,027
Like snakes or something.

243
00:13:00,781 --> 00:13:02,947
You don't have a nametag.

244
00:13:03,784 --> 00:13:07,385
Um... Oh, I... I guess I don't.

245
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:12,941
The other doctor had
a nametag on her coat.

246
00:13:13,043 --> 00:13:16,294
- I had to change my lab coat.
- Think I'm an idiot?

247
00:13:18,331 --> 00:13:19,451
You're working for them.

248
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:22,283
Got my mother, you're
trying to get me. Stay away!

249
00:13:24,487 --> 00:13:27,872
I keep telling you
people! Stay away from us!

250
00:13:35,849 --> 00:13:38,127
I called security.
They're on their way.

251
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:40,584
Where's Psych? I asked
you to page them an hour ago.

252
00:13:40,686 --> 00:13:43,154
I paged them twice.
Wanna see the log book?

253
00:13:43,256 --> 00:13:45,773
I wanna know how a paranoid
patient got out of the ER.

254
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:47,107
Where were you?

255
00:13:47,209 --> 00:13:49,476
I stepped away from my desk
to deal with another patient.

256
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:52,947
Normally, being a punching
bag for doctors is part of the job.

257
00:13:53,049 --> 00:13:55,366
There's a merger,
we're all being looked at.

258
00:13:55,452 --> 00:13:57,952
I'm not about to go down
for a mistake that wasn't mine.

259
00:13:58,054 --> 00:14:01,823
So, if you'll excuse me,
I'll page Psych again.

260
00:14:05,194 --> 00:14:07,895
OK, Mr. Trinidad, your
shunt revision is pretty simple.

261
00:14:07,997 --> 00:14:09,730
Shouldn't take
longer than an hour,

262
00:14:09,832 --> 00:14:13,334
but I do need to go over the
possible complications with you.

263
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:15,013
Dr. Stevens, could
I have a word?

264
00:14:15,037 --> 00:14:16,971
Give me a minute until I'm done.

265
00:14:17,073 --> 00:14:19,890
I'm sorry. This'll
only take a minute.

266
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:22,510
Excuse me.

267
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:24,178
- What?
- How are you holding up?

268
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,720
- Fine.
- Take your meds?

269
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:28,048
- Not yet, but I will.
- Supposed to take them at nine.

270
00:14:28,151 --> 00:14:31,352
- It's only a little after nine.
- It's 10:15.

271
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:33,938
Run down to her
locker and get her meds.

272
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,472
Are they in your purse?

273
00:14:35,575 --> 00:14:37,853
- Yes, but you don't
have to get them.
- Yes, you do.

274
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:40,227
- No, you don't! Alex!
- I swear to God,

275
00:14:40,329 --> 00:14:42,191
if you don't go and
get her pills now,

276
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:45,232
I'm gonna hurt you
and I'm gonna like it.

277
00:14:46,503 --> 00:14:48,953
You can't do this. You
can't treat me like I'm sick.

278
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:51,016
My patients need to have
faith in me. What are you doing?

279
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,858
- Your wig was crooked.
- Ow!

280
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:57,645
I'll stop hovering if you
stop acting like an idiot.

281
00:14:58,465 --> 00:14:59,897
Your next pill is at 2:00.

282
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:01,961
You can't take it on
an empty stomach.

283
00:15:01,985 --> 00:15:04,084
OK.

284
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,122
Tyler Lee, nine years
old, came in with renal colic

285
00:15:09,225 --> 00:15:12,393
three days ago that has not
resolved. We're going to perform

286
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:16,130
extracorporeal shockwave therapy
today to break up stones in his ureter

287
00:15:16,232 --> 00:15:19,316
- so they can pass.
- No, we're not.

288
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,569
- Oh, uh, yes, we are.
- No, we're not.

289
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:24,055
There was no blood in
his urine this morning.

290
00:15:24,157 --> 00:15:27,391
Just in case, we should do
the procedure. Just in case?

291
00:15:27,493 --> 00:15:29,910
You want to do a surgical
procedure on a nine year old

292
00:15:30,013 --> 00:15:32,880
even though it's
no longer indicated?

293
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:37,084
- No. Of course not.
- OK.

294
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:40,220
So Dr. Yang, wanna tell the
good news to Tyler and his mom?

295
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:46,277
It seems as though your son's
stones may have passed on their own.

296
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:49,847
- He doesn't need surgery?
- No. Looks like
he healed himself.

297
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,082
Can you believe that?
On your first day in Peds.

298
00:15:52,185 --> 00:15:54,868
- No, I can't, actually.
- Does this mean I can eat?

299
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:57,755
Yeah. Dr. Yang will
get you something.

300
00:16:00,743 --> 00:16:04,211
An abdominal aortic
aneurysm, 8.7 centimeters.

301
00:16:04,313 --> 00:16:06,280
This has a 75 percent
chance of rupturing.

302
00:16:06,383 --> 00:16:10,017
- She's a ticking time bomb.
- I'm surprised she woke up,

303
00:16:10,119 --> 00:16:11,630
let alone got into a car.

304
00:16:11,654 --> 00:16:14,021
OK, cancel all of my elective
surgeries this afternoon

305
00:16:14,124 --> 00:16:17,842
and book an OR. We need
to get her in there ASAP.

306
00:16:17,944 --> 00:16:20,077
OK, Jodie, we're done.

307
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:22,547
I'll meet you downstairs
to go over the results.

308
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:25,182
- Have you seen Tom?
- I thought he was with you.

309
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:28,135
He was, but he left.
He attacked me and left.

310
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:31,589
He...? You told me
you could handle this.

311
00:16:31,691 --> 00:16:34,825
No, it's under control.
Don't worry. I called security.

312
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:37,061
I thought maybe his
mom would have an idea...

313
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:39,396
His mom has a triple-A. The
last thing she needs to know

314
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:42,800
is that her mentally ill
son is loose in the hospital!

315
00:16:42,902 --> 00:16:45,436
I know this is bad.
This is really, really bad.

316
00:16:45,538 --> 00:16:49,123
I'm gonna stop listening because the
words you are saying are hurting me.

317
00:16:49,225 --> 00:16:51,391
- Find him!
- Yes.

318
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,955
- You look crazy.
- This is partly your fault.

319
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:06,490
You're the one who
told me to go act

320
00:17:06,593 --> 00:17:08,125
like I deserve
to be here. I did!

321
00:17:08,228 --> 00:17:10,911
Now, I lost a schizophrenic
and I am gonna be fired

322
00:17:11,013 --> 00:17:13,581
unless I find the schizophrenic!

323
00:17:13,683 --> 00:17:15,650
You're not gonna
find him back there.

324
00:17:15,752 --> 00:17:19,387
You do not get to be charmed by
this, because this is not charming!

325
00:17:19,489 --> 00:17:22,356
This is me getting
cut from the program!

326
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,953
You're already amazing.
I'm just starting out!

327
00:17:24,977 --> 00:17:29,179
OK? I've never stapled a bowel
and I've never resected an esophagus!

328
00:17:29,282 --> 00:17:32,249
- I am not amazing yet!
- All right. Let's just breathe.

329
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:36,387
And again. Good.

330
00:17:36,489 --> 00:17:38,906
Look at me. Security is on this.

331
00:17:39,008 --> 00:17:41,758
You have become a crazy
person I do not recognize.

332
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,978
I want Lexie back.

333
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:46,714
- Can I get Lexie back?
- Stay away from me!

334
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:49,500
- Oh, God, that's him.
- Just...

335
00:17:49,602 --> 00:17:52,720
Where's my mother? What
have you done with her? No!

336
00:17:52,822 --> 00:17:55,756
Sir!

337
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:13,290
Mrs. Crowley, there's evidence
your son may have suffered

338
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:15,976
some injury in this fall.
We don't think it's bad,

339
00:18:16,078 --> 00:18:18,095
but we need to do an
ultrasound to make sure.

340
00:18:18,197 --> 00:18:21,315
He's been sedated, but I need you
to wait here until we're completed.

341
00:18:21,417 --> 00:18:25,019
- All right?
- I never should have
left him alone.

342
00:18:25,121 --> 00:18:29,156
- I knew it. I knew it.
- OK, Mrs. Crowley,

343
00:18:29,259 --> 00:18:31,475
I need to talk to you
about your test results.

344
00:18:31,577 --> 00:18:34,245
The wall of your aorta
is dangerously thin

345
00:18:34,347 --> 00:18:35,829
and could burst at any moment.

346
00:18:35,931 --> 00:18:38,365
And when that happens,
it will most likely kill you.

347
00:18:38,467 --> 00:18:40,000
I'm not mincing my
words now because

348
00:18:40,102 --> 00:18:43,121
I need you to
understand the severity.

349
00:18:43,223 --> 00:18:45,055
I need to take you up
to surgery right now.

350
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:48,809
I can't. I can't have
surgery right now.

351
00:18:48,911 --> 00:18:51,696
I can't leave Tom.
He's injured, he's upset,

352
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:55,649
this has been a rough
day on him. I can't. No.

353
00:18:55,752 --> 00:18:59,670
- It'll have to wait.
- Isn't there someone
you can call?

354
00:18:59,772 --> 00:19:04,275
No. My ex-husband left
when Tom first got sick

355
00:19:04,376 --> 00:19:07,511
and friends have
fallen away. It's only me.

356
00:19:09,432 --> 00:19:11,632
We have services.
We can arrange...

357
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:15,603
I can't just leave
him with a stranger.

358
00:19:16,305 --> 00:19:17,905
I need time.

359
00:19:18,007 --> 00:19:21,792
To hire someone and train them,

360
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:25,012
to know that if he's watching
TV and holding his head

361
00:19:25,114 --> 00:19:28,215
a certain way, it means
the television is talking to him

362
00:19:28,317 --> 00:19:30,167
and he needs to be distracted.

363
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:33,104
He likes shopping, but they
can't take him to the place

364
00:19:33,206 --> 00:19:36,674
on Lee Road because he
thinks they're out to get him.

365
00:19:36,776 --> 00:19:38,792
They have to go to the
place on River Road,

366
00:19:38,894 --> 00:19:41,996
but they've gotta park in the
back because underground parking

367
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:46,801
makes him upset, and it
goes on and on and on.

368
00:19:46,903 --> 00:19:49,770
So no, please.

369
00:19:49,872 --> 00:19:52,506
I need time.

370
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:56,661
A week. I've made it this long,
I can make it another week.

371
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:59,863
I'm not sure that you
have another week.

372
00:19:59,965 --> 00:20:03,133
I need you to think
about yourself right now.

373
00:20:03,235 --> 00:20:06,420
I have a mentally ill son.

374
00:20:06,522 --> 00:20:10,157
I don't get to think of
just myself anymore.

375
00:20:21,454 --> 00:20:23,387
Hey! Whoa, what
are you doing here?

376
00:20:23,489 --> 00:20:25,456
I was just, um...

377
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:27,919
Uh... I just stopped by
to get some old case files.

378
00:20:27,943 --> 00:20:31,345
- For what?
- Um, this job opening
in Portland.

379
00:20:31,447 --> 00:20:33,547
- Oregon?
- Yeah.

380
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:37,551
The merger. I mean, the chief
already got rid of me once, so...

381
00:20:39,956 --> 00:20:44,992
Yeah, no, that's smart,
smart of you to have a backup.

382
00:20:49,732 --> 00:20:53,000
Hey, I'm working with Cristina.
She's interested in Peds.

383
00:20:53,102 --> 00:20:56,737
- No, she isn't.
- Yeah, she is.

384
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:59,640
- OK.
- Did she say something to you?

385
00:20:59,742 --> 00:21:02,276
She doesn't have
to. She's Cristina.

386
00:21:02,378 --> 00:21:04,512
Help me out here. I don't
know what that means.

387
00:21:04,613 --> 00:21:08,281
I shouldn't say anything.
She's my roommate.

388
00:21:08,384 --> 00:21:11,618
And you're my girlfriend.
Girlfriend trumps roommate. Fine.

389
00:21:11,721 --> 00:21:13,532
She's Cristina. She's
all about Cardio.

390
00:21:13,556 --> 00:21:15,701
So she's probably
sucking up to you

391
00:21:15,725 --> 00:21:18,459
to get through the merger.

392
00:21:18,561 --> 00:21:20,227
Is she good with the kids?

393
00:21:22,247 --> 00:21:26,683
- She's sucking up.
- Yeah.

394
00:21:29,088 --> 00:21:32,289
- Nice pin.
- His name is Mr. Bear.

395
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:35,208
- He eats children.
- Not having fun in Peds?

396
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:40,397
My kid wants chocolate
pudding badly. This is the last one.

397
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:44,501
My triple-A got cancelled. You
guys got any surgeries I can get in on?

398
00:21:44,603 --> 00:21:46,803
I'm on post-ops and
she's babysitting.

399
00:21:46,856 --> 00:21:48,405
I can't stand it any longer.

400
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:51,509
Can't you go to the chief and use
your dead mommy to get answers?

401
00:21:51,611 --> 00:21:54,595
We don't need dead mommy.
We are going to be fine.

402
00:21:54,697 --> 00:21:57,848
I let a crazy man escape and
he fell down a flight of stairs.

403
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:00,784
- Is it surgical?
- Don't know. I got kicked off the case.

404
00:22:00,886 --> 00:22:02,530
So then I went to
watch a surgery.

405
00:22:02,554 --> 00:22:04,394
I figure I can't screw that up.

406
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:07,758
The second I get to the
gallery, the shunt starts bleeding.

407
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,693
I left before Shepherd
could blame me.

408
00:22:09,795 --> 00:22:13,464
- Shepherd's shunt went bad?
- They converted to
open craniotomy.

409
00:22:13,566 --> 00:22:16,132
Something I'll probably
never get a chance to do.

410
00:22:16,235 --> 00:22:18,752
- She can't handle a craniotomy.
- Even he sees it.

411
00:22:18,854 --> 00:22:23,456
He's not talking about
you. He's talking about Izzie.

412
00:22:23,558 --> 00:22:25,776
I really admire you.
In case I get cut and

413
00:22:25,878 --> 00:22:29,913
don't get a chance to tell
you. Plus, you're really pretty.

414
00:22:32,418 --> 00:22:33,751
You can have the rest.

415
00:22:35,988 --> 00:22:38,723
And you and I, we
were getting so close.

416
00:22:40,126 --> 00:22:42,459
I need to speak with
Dr. Stevens, please.

417
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:44,729
- Alex, I'm in surgery.
- Izzie.

418
00:22:44,831 --> 00:22:46,830
Alex, leave.

419
00:22:49,402 --> 00:22:52,203
Dr. Shepherd, could you
please tell Dr. Karev to leave?

420
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:54,650
- Karev.
- She gets tired
walking to the mailbox.

421
00:22:54,674 --> 00:22:56,634
She can't handle
a five-hour surgery.

422
00:22:56,658 --> 00:22:58,241
I know what I can handle.

423
00:22:58,343 --> 00:23:00,761
No one's gonna think less
of you if you walk out of here.

424
00:23:00,863 --> 00:23:04,081
- Walk out now.
- Have this conversation
outside.

425
00:23:04,183 --> 00:23:05,949
No. I'm not leaving. Alex!

426
00:23:15,344 --> 00:23:17,189
You paged me. What's going on?

427
00:23:17,213 --> 00:23:19,546
You have to tell the
chief you need me.

428
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:20,781
That George was your guy,

429
00:23:20,883 --> 00:23:23,600
but he died so you need
a new guy and that's me.

430
00:23:23,702 --> 00:23:25,602
- OK? Right now. Go, go, go.
- Come on.

431
00:23:25,704 --> 00:23:29,089
- If anyone's safe, it's you.
- Be casual but firm. He likes you.

432
00:23:29,191 --> 00:23:32,393
- Cristina!
- I played hide and seek today

433
00:23:32,495 --> 00:23:35,790
and didn't go to surgery because
a nine-year-old miraculously peed

434
00:23:35,814 --> 00:23:37,826
without blood. I
can't do this anymore.

435
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:40,050
Tell Dr. Robbins you don't
think Peds is your thing.

436
00:23:40,152 --> 00:23:41,351
What's the big deal?

437
00:23:41,453 --> 00:23:44,154
The big deal is that the
chief is in there making a list.

438
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,690
- You don't know that.
- Who stays and who goes,

439
00:23:46,793 --> 00:23:49,471
- and I can't be
on that "goes" list.
- You'll deal with it.

440
00:23:49,495 --> 00:23:53,079
If I am? There can be no "if".

441
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:55,582
I have to be on
the "stays" list.

442
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:57,829
That list is everything,
that list is my future,

443
00:23:57,853 --> 00:24:01,572
- my salvation. The list is life.
- Calm down.

444
00:24:01,674 --> 00:24:05,810
<i>Schindler's List?</i> You're comparing
this merger to the Holocaust?

445
00:24:05,912 --> 00:24:09,012
- I'm Jewish. I'm allowed.
- You're irrational.

446
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:14,050
- So this is a no?
- This is a no.

447
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:23,127
- Somebody page Sloan stat!
- Right away, doctor.

448
00:24:24,246 --> 00:24:28,566
OK, Elizabeth, take me
through exactly what happened.

449
00:24:28,668 --> 00:24:31,352
I was doing a crash
C-section on this 32-weeker.

450
00:24:31,454 --> 00:24:34,120
Had the incision done
in five minutes flat,

451
00:24:34,222 --> 00:24:35,806
but I must have cut too deep

452
00:24:35,908 --> 00:24:38,809
because when I went in to
take the baby, I pulled the arm...

453
00:24:38,895 --> 00:24:42,096
- Oh, my God!
- Get me the umbilical cord.

454
00:24:42,198 --> 00:24:44,331
- Umbilical cord?
- Just get it!

455
00:24:56,462 --> 00:24:58,329
I got it. I got the
umbilical cord.

456
00:24:58,431 --> 00:25:00,241
Get me five centimeters of it.

457
00:25:00,265 --> 00:25:03,099
- What's going on?
- Arm got damaged
during a stat C.

458
00:25:03,202 --> 00:25:05,836
I'm gonna use the
umbilical artery if it's viable.

459
00:25:05,938 --> 00:25:07,921
It looks a little dry.

460
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,460
- Looks like it's gonna work.
- She's stable.

461
00:25:13,562 --> 00:25:17,231
Let's put it in antibiotic solution
and move this party to the OR.

462
00:25:24,807 --> 00:25:28,659
I'm sorry, I just... I wanted
to make sure you were OK.

463
00:25:28,761 --> 00:25:30,977
Are you OK?

464
00:25:32,114 --> 00:25:34,247
I injured my spleen,

465
00:25:34,349 --> 00:25:38,435
and they're just waiting to see
if it stops bleeding on its own.

466
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:41,037
Good.

467
00:25:41,139 --> 00:25:43,407
I'm glad. You seem...

468
00:25:43,509 --> 00:25:46,460
Well, you seem
better and I'm glad.

469
00:25:46,562 --> 00:25:49,679
Anyway, I should... I should
go. I'm not supposed to be here.

470
00:25:49,782 --> 00:25:54,301
It's all right. They
got me in restraints.

471
00:25:54,403 --> 00:25:58,321
I wouldn't be able to hurt you
even if the voices told me to.

472
00:25:58,941 --> 00:26:01,408
It's a joke.

473
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:03,510
Schizophrenia humor.

474
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:12,803
Um... There's this thought
that I'm trying to get it out,

475
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:18,892
and I keep thinking that
they planted a camera

476
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:21,144
in my stomach
during the ultrasound.

477
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:25,749
I was gonna wake my mother
and have her talk me down, but...

478
00:26:25,835 --> 00:26:28,235
She's tired.

479
00:26:39,648 --> 00:26:43,800
Here is... your spleen.

480
00:26:43,902 --> 00:26:48,739
See? And this bright spot
right here, that's blood.

481
00:26:48,841 --> 00:26:51,875
That's not supposed
to be there. But...

482
00:26:52,978 --> 00:26:54,394
no camera.

483
00:26:56,749 --> 00:26:59,899
- No camera.
- Mm-mm.

484
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:03,087
I can leave this up if you want.

485
00:27:03,189 --> 00:27:06,406
So that when the
thoughts come back,

486
00:27:06,508 --> 00:27:08,775
you can look and see
that they're not real.

487
00:27:08,878 --> 00:27:13,931
They're just scary
thoughts. They're not real.

488
00:27:25,261 --> 00:27:27,261
Thank you.

489
00:27:27,363 --> 00:27:29,246
A little more suction.

490
00:27:29,348 --> 00:27:31,281
It's 2:00, Izzie.

491
00:27:31,383 --> 00:27:34,317
- Oh, my God.
- No more fighting in my OR.

492
00:27:34,419 --> 00:27:36,186
Go deal with this.

493
00:27:41,143 --> 00:27:43,744
- I hate you.
- Shut up.

494
00:27:52,371 --> 00:27:54,271
OK.

495
00:28:02,565 --> 00:28:04,565
God...

496
00:28:05,935 --> 00:28:09,236
- Thank you.
- Shut up. Get back to work.

497
00:28:17,212 --> 00:28:19,045
Has Mrs. Crowley
agreed to the surgery?

498
00:28:19,147 --> 00:28:21,648
No. She's gonna go
home and she's gonna die.

499
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:25,201
- What's that boy
gonna be left with?
- He needs surgery.

500
00:28:25,303 --> 00:28:28,655
Does he need a transfusion?
Is there active bleeding?

501
00:28:28,757 --> 00:28:31,508
No, his crit's stable. I
know we don't operate

502
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:34,144
unless there's an active
bleed, but it's so close and if we

503
00:28:34,246 --> 00:28:37,014
operate on him, maybe
she'll let us operate on her.

504
00:28:37,116 --> 00:28:39,149
We can keep them
together through the surgery,

505
00:28:39,251 --> 00:28:41,467
through recovery, they'll
be together. Maybe you think

506
00:28:41,569 --> 00:28:44,354
this is bad, I'm proposing
unnecessary surgery,

507
00:28:44,456 --> 00:28:46,740
maybe you'll tell the
chief, he'll think it makes me

508
00:28:46,842 --> 00:28:48,808
a bad doctor, but it
makes me a good doctor.

509
00:28:48,928 --> 00:28:51,762
- Stop talking.
- Are my words hurting
you again?

510
00:28:51,864 --> 00:28:54,548
No. You're right.

511
00:28:55,534 --> 00:28:57,901
It's a good idea.

512
00:29:00,389 --> 00:29:03,457
How does this happen? Was
Chen just not paying attention?

513
00:29:03,559 --> 00:29:05,108
She made a mistake.

514
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:07,122
Wrong time to make a
mistake, with the merger.

515
00:29:07,146 --> 00:29:10,680
You people need to stop with
doom and gloom merger scenarios.

516
00:29:10,782 --> 00:29:13,751
I read that the hospital's
revenues went up last quarter.

517
00:29:13,853 --> 00:29:16,904
Except for elective procedures
which went down 13 percent.

518
00:29:17,006 --> 00:29:20,140
You mean elective
procedures like plastic surgeries.

519
00:29:20,242 --> 00:29:22,853
- You're saying
I'm gonna get fired?
- No one is safe.

520
00:29:22,877 --> 00:29:25,145
- I'm safe.
- How can you be sure?

521
00:29:25,247 --> 00:29:28,198
Hey! We're about to
reattach a baby's arm.

522
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:31,167
We need to stop thinking about
the merger and think instead

523
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:32,480
about this girl throwing a ball,

524
00:29:32,504 --> 00:29:35,606
holding a spoon
and waving bye-bye.

525
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:45,832
No, I'm not letting
you cut me open.

526
00:29:45,934 --> 00:29:48,935
You're gonna put a camera in
me. You're... You are one of them.

527
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:52,956
- OK, Mrs. Crowley...
- No. He's scared. He said no.

528
00:29:53,826 --> 00:29:55,236
Tom, you need this surgery.

529
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:57,961
And you will feel better
after it. And your mom...

530
00:29:58,063 --> 00:30:01,898
Your mom's surgery
will save her life.

531
00:30:04,954 --> 00:30:06,820
OK. Look...

532
00:30:06,922 --> 00:30:09,489
Tom, look at me. Look at me.

533
00:30:09,591 --> 00:30:13,409
I am not an alien. I
am not one of them.

534
00:30:13,511 --> 00:30:17,580
My name is Miranda Bailey.
I have a three-year-old son.

535
00:30:17,683 --> 00:30:19,710
And I would do anything for him.

536
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:22,318
Just like your mom
would do anything for you.

537
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:26,572
Now, she needs
you to do this for her.

538
00:30:26,692 --> 00:30:31,829
Otherwise, she will die
and you will be alone.

539
00:30:45,894 --> 00:30:47,844
Look, see? Red.

540
00:30:47,946 --> 00:30:49,913
Red blood.

541
00:30:50,015 --> 00:30:52,348
See, I'm human.

542
00:30:56,088 --> 00:31:01,191
I am a doctor and I want
to help you and your mom.

543
00:31:01,293 --> 00:31:05,578
But you have to trust me.

544
00:31:16,508 --> 00:31:18,186
OK. I think we're there.

545
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:20,171
If it pinks up, we've
done our job right.

546
00:31:20,195 --> 00:31:22,846
Releasing the bulldog
clamps. Here we go.

547
00:31:41,483 --> 00:31:44,150
That's how I know my
job is safe, Dr. Yang.

548
00:31:44,252 --> 00:31:46,533
Because I reattach babies' arms.

549
00:31:52,878 --> 00:31:55,279
It's not a good idea to
piss off your attending.

550
00:31:55,381 --> 00:31:57,347
I didn't know he was
upset. I'll apologize.

551
00:31:57,449 --> 00:32:00,801
- I wasn't talking about him.
- Sorry?

552
00:32:00,903 --> 00:32:04,805
I like kids and I like their parents,
and I like to see them smile.

553
00:32:04,907 --> 00:32:07,857
I like going to get them pudding
and playing games with them

554
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:10,359
because it makes attaching
their arms way more fun.

555
00:32:10,395 --> 00:32:12,646
I don't like being used.

556
00:32:12,748 --> 00:32:16,883
- I wasn't...
- I like being
lied to even less.

557
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:28,161
What do we need from
the store, sweetheart?

558
00:32:28,263 --> 00:32:30,864
Tell me what we
need from the store.

559
00:32:30,966 --> 00:32:34,901
Apples, pears, strawberries.

560
00:32:35,003 --> 00:32:37,604
Apples, pears, strawberries.

561
00:32:37,706 --> 00:32:41,507
Pears, apples...

562
00:32:46,664 --> 00:32:49,783
- What if I don't make it?
- You don't worry about that.

563
00:32:49,885 --> 00:32:51,802
OK? Let me do that.

564
00:33:02,497 --> 00:33:04,381
Let's go.

565
00:33:14,843 --> 00:33:18,712
OK. Bleeding's stopped.

566
00:33:18,814 --> 00:33:20,513
Let's close up.

567
00:33:21,766 --> 00:33:24,734
- Stevens, scrub out.
- No, I'm fine. I'm your resident.

568
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:28,154
Someone else can close up. You've
been on your feet for five hours.

569
00:33:28,257 --> 00:33:30,073
- You look exhausted.
- I'm not.

570
00:33:30,175 --> 00:33:32,709
You're dripping with sweat.

571
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:38,115
You know what?
Just take my wig off.

572
00:33:38,217 --> 00:33:40,149
Just take it off! Take it off.

573
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:45,354
Just pat down my head.

574
00:33:45,456 --> 00:33:48,508
OK. Just put the cap back on.

575
00:33:51,864 --> 00:33:54,431
Thank you.

576
00:33:55,517 --> 00:33:56,767
I'm fine.

577
00:34:10,982 --> 00:34:14,184
Isobel Stevens spent five
hours on her feet in surgery today,

578
00:34:14,286 --> 00:34:17,320
not because she was ready,
but because she's scared.

579
00:34:17,422 --> 00:34:22,125
She's scared for her job, and
she was scared to show weakness.

580
00:34:24,913 --> 00:34:26,658
You don't have to talk to me.

581
00:34:26,682 --> 00:34:28,726
But you need to
talk to your people.

582
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:31,985
- They need to hear from you.
- Don't tell me about my people!

583
00:34:32,087 --> 00:34:36,839
I have been here for 30
years, Derek. I know my people.

584
00:34:36,941 --> 00:34:38,953
I have spent every hour
of the last three days

585
00:34:38,977 --> 00:34:40,638
trying to save
every job I could.

586
00:34:40,662 --> 00:34:43,613
But tough choices
had to be made.

587
00:34:46,668 --> 00:34:49,435
HR is sending an e-mail to the
first round of people to be let go.

588
00:34:49,537 --> 00:34:52,822
- Richard...
- Derek, I'm tired. I'm going home.

589
00:35:02,701 --> 00:35:05,385
- What's going on? You paged.
- Check your e-mail.

590
00:35:05,487 --> 00:35:06,714
- For what?
- HR.

591
00:35:06,738 --> 00:35:08,183
If you got cut, you'll
have an e-mail.

592
00:35:08,207 --> 00:35:12,425
I didn't get one, but I've
been calm through this crisis.

593
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:17,330
I have been calm. But if one
of us gets cut, I will not be calm.

594
00:35:22,103 --> 00:35:25,455
- No e-mail.
- I'm fine.

595
00:35:26,692 --> 00:35:30,443
- I'm good, too.
- Good! See? I knew it.

596
00:35:30,562 --> 00:35:33,563
- I knew none of us'd get cut.
- Yet.

597
00:35:33,665 --> 00:35:36,065
There's gonna be another round.

598
00:35:40,272 --> 00:35:44,240
OK. So I'm there in the
spleen repair with Dr. Hunt,

599
00:35:44,342 --> 00:35:47,277
and he's got the cautery and
he's moving it back and forth,

600
00:35:47,379 --> 00:35:51,230
fixing bleeders. And then
he just... hands it to me.

601
00:35:51,332 --> 00:35:54,384
Like it's the most normal
thing in the world to do.

602
00:35:54,486 --> 00:35:59,422
Like I repair spleens all
the time. And so I do it.

603
00:35:59,525 --> 00:36:02,158
I repair the spleen on my own.

604
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:06,546
And I realize if we
just focus on our jobs,

605
00:36:06,648 --> 00:36:09,415
we focus on our patients,
we're gonna be fine.

606
00:36:09,517 --> 00:36:11,183
Megan got cut.

607
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:15,622
- I didn't, but she did.
- What? How?

608
00:36:15,724 --> 00:36:18,124
The chief sent out an e-mail.

609
00:36:18,226 --> 00:36:21,178
He fired three
quarters of our class.

610
00:36:24,499 --> 00:36:26,732
We're having a baby.

611
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,687
Terry, it's been a
pleasure working with you.

612
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:50,756
- Thanks.
- Sorry about everything.

613
00:36:52,894 --> 00:36:55,094
- Hey, hey.
- What did I do wrong,

614
00:36:55,197 --> 00:36:57,697
- so I can learn?
- You didn't do anything wrong.

615
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:00,199
This is about the money.

616
00:37:08,376 --> 00:37:11,677
I've been here seven years.

617
00:37:11,779 --> 00:37:13,930
All my friends are here.

618
00:37:14,032 --> 00:37:18,968
I'll find another job,
but... seven years.

619
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:21,153
You have no idea.

620
00:37:22,023 --> 00:37:23,823
If...

621
00:37:23,925 --> 00:37:28,828
If you need a job recommendation,
anything, just call me, OK?

622
00:37:33,118 --> 00:37:34,617
Hmm.

623
00:37:36,988 --> 00:37:39,339
- Rough day?
- I need some sleep.

624
00:37:39,441 --> 00:37:43,126
- OK. Let's go home.
- I can't. I just got
kicked off Peds.

625
00:37:43,228 --> 00:37:45,194
- I'm totally screwed.
- Cristina...

626
00:37:45,296 --> 00:37:47,230
I can't sleep. I can't.

627
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:52,202
I can't leave if
she's not leaving.

628
00:37:53,538 --> 00:37:55,805
<i>We're all susceptible to it.</i>

629
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:02,996
<i>The dread and anxiety of
not knowing what's coming.</i>

630
00:38:03,097 --> 00:38:05,364
No way.

631
00:38:06,768 --> 00:38:08,601
Are you serious?

632
00:38:10,138 --> 00:38:11,437
I'm gonna go to the chief.

633
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:15,174
I'll tell him you're the
best second-year resident.

634
00:38:16,511 --> 00:38:19,111
I'm safe.

635
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:22,649
I didn't get cut,
Mark. I'm safe.

636
00:38:29,891 --> 00:38:32,992
<i>It's pointless in the end.</i>

637
00:38:41,536 --> 00:38:44,954
I hate, hate, hate this merger

638
00:38:45,056 --> 00:38:48,191
because I hate long
distance relationships.

639
00:38:48,293 --> 00:38:52,578
I don't believe in them. So
you can't move to Portland.

640
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:55,726
When I mentioned it this
afternoon, you didn't seem to mind.

641
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,444
You were like,
"Move to Portland".

642
00:38:57,468 --> 00:38:59,536
I didn't know I was
allowed to mind.

643
00:38:59,638 --> 00:39:01,270
I didn't know if we
were girlfriends.

644
00:39:01,372 --> 00:39:03,006
But then you said girlfriend.

645
00:39:03,107 --> 00:39:07,660
You called me your
girlfriend. So I need to know.

646
00:39:07,763 --> 00:39:09,779
Am I your girlfriend?

647
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:13,766
Yeah.

648
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:18,704
OK. Good.

649
00:39:18,806 --> 00:39:22,391
You're not moving to Portland.
No. What you are gonna do

650
00:39:22,493 --> 00:39:25,394
- is go to the chief and beg...
- I'm not gonna grovel.

651
00:39:25,496 --> 00:39:29,415
Uh, yes, you are. Seriously,
you don't want to mess with me.

652
00:39:29,534 --> 00:39:32,569
<i>Because all the worrying...</i>

653
00:39:35,657 --> 00:39:39,992
<i>and all the making of plans for
things that could or could not happen...</i>

654
00:39:45,667 --> 00:39:47,733
<i>it only makes things worse.</i>

655
00:39:47,835 --> 00:39:50,803
I forgot he was dead today.

656
00:39:50,905 --> 00:39:54,474
For a few hours in
surgery, I forgot I had cancer

657
00:39:54,576 --> 00:39:56,709
and I forgot he was dead.

658
00:39:59,514 --> 00:40:01,814
But George is dead.

659
00:40:03,652 --> 00:40:05,985
And you do have cancer.

660
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:11,841
I want you to keep
doing what you love.

661
00:40:13,795 --> 00:40:16,863
You're a great doctor.

662
00:40:16,965 --> 00:40:20,633
And you have a fantastic
future ahead of you.

663
00:40:22,103 --> 00:40:26,005
But you gotta step up and
start taking care of yourself.

664
00:40:27,275 --> 00:40:31,077
You gotta take your
meds, you gotta eat,

665
00:40:31,179 --> 00:40:33,513
you gotta pace yourself.

666
00:40:33,614 --> 00:40:36,134
Because I can't be your nurse.

667
00:40:37,285 --> 00:40:38,951
I can't.

668
00:40:56,187 --> 00:40:58,387
<i>So walk your dog.</i>

669
00:41:00,592 --> 00:41:04,360
<i>Or take a nap. Just,
whatever you do,</i>

670
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:07,263
- <i>stop worrying.</i>
- I don't have time for games.

671
00:41:07,365 --> 00:41:09,076
I have to get back
to the hospital.

672
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:10,917
She's right. She has to go back.

673
00:41:11,019 --> 00:41:13,664
We're not talking about the
hospital. We're playing baseball.

674
00:41:13,688 --> 00:41:16,038
And drink beer. Drink your beer.

675
00:41:16,141 --> 00:41:18,507
- What more do you want?
- How can I drink when all

676
00:41:18,609 --> 00:41:21,093
- my friends just got fired?
- Sorry, I'm leaving.

677
00:41:21,195 --> 00:41:22,762
- No.
- You need this.

678
00:41:22,864 --> 00:41:25,126
Put this on. That's right.

679
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:26,416
There we go.

680
00:41:26,518 --> 00:41:29,452
- Here. Here.
- No... No!

681
00:41:29,554 --> 00:41:33,088
- Now, hit the ball!
- I don't wanna hit the ball.

682
00:41:35,026 --> 00:41:36,976
- Oh, my God!
- Batter, batter...

683
00:41:37,078 --> 00:41:40,146
What are you...?

684
00:41:40,248 --> 00:41:42,331
Stop thinking about
what's gonna happen.

685
00:41:42,433 --> 00:41:44,733
Focus on what's
right in front of you.

686
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:46,869
Now, hit the ball!

687
00:41:50,892 --> 00:41:54,944
Oh, my God! I hit it!
I hit it! Oh, my God!

688
00:41:55,046 --> 00:41:57,296
- Oh, my God! I hit it!
- Wait, wait.

689
00:41:57,398 --> 00:41:59,849
<i>Because the only
cure for paranoia...</i>

690
00:41:59,951 --> 00:42:02,351
- I hit it!
- Now you like baseball.

691
00:42:02,387 --> 00:42:04,470
Unbelievable.
Here we go, let's go.

692
00:42:04,572 --> 00:42:06,572
<i>Is to be...</i>

693
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:09,808
<i>here.</i>

694
00:42:13,181 --> 00:42:15,164
<i>Just as you are.</i>
