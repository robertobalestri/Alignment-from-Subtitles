00:00:02,069 --> 00:00:03,180
<i>Previously on</i> Grey's Anatomy:

2
00:00:03,204 --> 00:00:04,531
I have an 18-year-old daughter.

3
00:00:04,555 --> 00:00:07,790
I'm having a baby and I don't
have anywhere else to go.

4
00:00:07,892 --> 00:00:09,353
Dr. Bailey, have
you seen the chief?

5
00:00:09,377 --> 00:00:11,521
There's something wrong with
his emergency chole patient.

6
00:00:11,545 --> 00:00:15,014
You may have accidentally
clipped the common bile duct.

7
00:00:15,116 --> 00:00:18,216
That's one of the most serious
mistakes a general surgeon can make.

8
00:00:18,318 --> 00:00:21,836
Have you told anyone what
you saw? Have you told Derek?

9
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:24,439
No.

10
00:00:24,541 --> 00:00:26,207
I have loved you forever.

11
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:28,110
I'm in love with Cristina.

12
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:35,600
<i>We assume the really
serious changes in our lives</i>

13
00:00:35,686 --> 00:00:39,922
<i>happen slowly, over time.</i>

14
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:42,825
<i>But it's not true.</i>

15
00:00:43,794 --> 00:00:46,477
<i>The big stuff
happens in an instant.</i>

16
00:00:50,233 --> 00:00:53,669
- You're up early.
- Yeah. I want to
get some stuff done

17
00:00:53,771 --> 00:00:55,370
so I can meet the
chief this afternoon.

18
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:57,755
He's gonna show me
another old surgery tape.

19
00:00:57,857 --> 00:01:02,243
Again? It's every night this week. I
thought last night was the last one.

20
00:01:02,345 --> 00:01:04,278
He got held up.
He couldn't make it.

21
00:01:04,381 --> 00:01:08,350
I went by his office on my way out.
He was sound asleep on his couch.

22
00:01:08,452 --> 00:01:12,337
Aah... Which is why
he couldn't make it.

23
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:15,457
I think maybe he just
doesn't sleep well at home,

24
00:01:15,559 --> 00:01:17,959
with Adele gone.

25
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:20,945
Mmm.

26
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:32,690
I need something from you.

27
00:01:36,563 --> 00:01:38,179
- That, too.
- Mmm.

28
00:01:38,281 --> 00:01:40,482
I need you to give Sloan
an ultrasound today.

29
00:01:40,584 --> 00:01:45,837
- It's been almost three weeks.
- Can't someone from OB do it?

30
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:48,106
Yeah, but...

31
00:01:49,342 --> 00:01:53,112
she likes you.
All the Sloans do.

32
00:01:55,331 --> 00:01:58,516
Hey, do we have
any more...? Oh! Ew!

33
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:00,178
- Sloan!
- Whoa!

34
00:02:00,237 --> 00:02:03,421
<i>Becoming an adult.
Becoming a parent.</i>

35
00:02:03,524 --> 00:02:04,957
<i>Becoming a doctor.</i>

36
00:02:05,059 --> 00:02:07,425
<i>One minute you're
not, and the next...</i>

37
00:02:07,527 --> 00:02:09,895
- Sloan?
- <i>you are.</i>

38
00:02:09,997 --> 00:02:13,698
- Sorry about that.
- Whatever. There's no more cereal.

39
00:02:13,801 --> 00:02:14,933
Why are you sorry?

40
00:02:15,035 --> 00:02:16,563
She's the one who didn't
knock before she came in.

41
00:02:16,587 --> 00:02:18,720
I'll get some cereal
this afternoon.

42
00:02:19,773 --> 00:02:21,506
How about some juice?

43
00:02:21,608 --> 00:02:23,803
Lexie's gonna give
you an ultrasound today.

44
00:02:23,827 --> 00:02:26,561
Why don't you pick up
some breakfast at the hospital.

45
00:02:26,663 --> 00:02:28,313
It's gonna be more.

46
00:02:28,415 --> 00:02:30,782
- You need some for lunch, too?
- Yeah.

47
00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:34,719
- I'm gonna shower.
- Can you hold on a minute?

48
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,771
I'm probably gonna
have to hurl this.

49
00:02:42,363 --> 00:02:44,508
Sloan Sloan monopolizing
your bathroom again?

50
00:02:44,532 --> 00:02:48,167
- Yeah. Yours?
- Owen's in mine.

51
00:02:50,571 --> 00:02:52,737
Oh, God!

52
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:56,941
- They're in there.
- You should knock first.

53
00:02:57,043 --> 00:02:58,810
I'm late. My hair is dirty.

54
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:02,164
And he just gave her 80 bucks
for a muffin and a sandwich.

55
00:03:02,266 --> 00:03:04,950
- That's quite a sandwich.
- She's gonna spend it on jeans

56
00:03:05,052 --> 00:03:08,153
that show off her butt crack, and
then ask me for half my pasta salad.

57
00:03:08,255 --> 00:03:11,640
- You sound like my mother.
- Knock much?

58
00:03:11,742 --> 00:03:13,407
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

59
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:15,978
There's no more hot water.

60
00:03:20,467 --> 00:03:23,485
<i>Ask any doctor, and
they can point to the</i>

61
00:03:23,587 --> 00:03:26,305
<i>one moment they
became a physician.</i>

62
00:03:26,407 --> 00:03:29,808
<i>It usually isn't med
school graduation day.</i>

63
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:32,560
Yang, you're going solo today.

64
00:03:32,662 --> 00:03:34,424
- Been there.
- Cardio solo.

65
00:03:34,448 --> 00:03:36,631
- <i>Whatever it is...</i>
- Valve replacement.

66
00:03:36,733 --> 00:03:39,317
- <i>nobody forgets it.</i>
- Porcine or...?

67
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,585
Mechanical.

68
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:42,715
I can try out the
sub-annular stitches?

69
00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:44,989
I didn't teach it to you
so you could crochet.

70
00:03:45,091 --> 00:03:47,759
OK. Thank you!

71
00:03:47,861 --> 00:03:49,044
Oh, my God!

72
00:03:49,146 --> 00:03:52,714
- What? What?
- Altman's letting her go solo

73
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:54,916
- on a valve.
- Wow!

74
00:03:55,018 --> 00:03:57,152
- Feel ready?
- She's ready.

75
00:03:57,254 --> 00:03:59,604
- She just needs to breathe.
- I am breathing.

76
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:02,641
I am a living, breathing

77
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:05,610
cardiothoracic
surgeon, as of right now.

78
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:08,529
I have to go prep.

79
00:04:08,631 --> 00:04:11,482
<i>Sometimes, you don't even
know anything's changed.</i>

80
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:15,587
<i>You think you're still you
and your life is still your life...</i>

81
00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:17,855
<i>but you wake up one
day and look around,</i>

82
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:20,425
<i>and you don't
recognize anything.</i>

83
00:04:20,527 --> 00:04:22,293
<i>Not anything at all.</i>

84
00:04:26,233 --> 00:04:29,700
Hey, do you have any cash? I
lost the headset to my phone.

85
00:04:29,803 --> 00:04:31,769
How about you hold
the phone up to your ear?

86
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:35,190
You were the one bitching at
me for being on the phone so late.

87
00:04:35,292 --> 00:04:37,576
Maybe if I had a headset, I
wouldn't have to talk so loud.

88
00:04:37,678 --> 00:04:39,578
Maybe if you had your
own apartment, you could

89
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,414
talk whenever you want, but
we're all making compromises.

90
00:04:42,516 --> 00:04:44,950
OK. Here's the head.

91
00:04:45,052 --> 00:04:48,203
- It looks like an alien.
- It's gonna be a cute alien.

92
00:04:48,305 --> 00:04:50,705
Boy alien or girl?

93
00:04:52,509 --> 00:04:54,976
Dude, does it
have a thing or not?

94
00:04:55,078 --> 00:04:58,746
I'm not looking at
the sex, I'm... I don't...

95
00:05:00,984 --> 00:05:03,669
Yeah. I'm new at
this. I'm not very good.

96
00:05:03,771 --> 00:05:07,205
So why don't we go upstairs.

97
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:10,609
There's a better machine. We'll
have someone else take a look.

98
00:05:12,513 --> 00:05:15,547
Adamson with me, Meredith
with Bailey, Karev with Torres.

99
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:17,899
- Tom Kates's in this ambulance.
- The quarterback?

100
00:05:18,001 --> 00:05:20,368
- Yeah.
- See photographers,
call security.

101
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:22,354
Tell your interns no
autographs, no pictures.

102
00:05:22,456 --> 00:05:24,650
I see anyone pull out a camera
phone, it's going in the toilet.

103
00:05:24,674 --> 00:05:27,074
- The three of us
on one patient?
- Come on.

104
00:05:27,176 --> 00:05:30,395
He's a high-profile patient,
he gets a lot of attention.

105
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:32,457
I thought we agreed
to stop meeting like this.

106
00:05:32,482 --> 00:05:34,360
What can I say, man, I
missed your smiling face.

107
00:05:34,384 --> 00:05:37,085
- Good to see you.
- Head trauma, but GCS 15

108
00:05:37,187 --> 00:05:40,155
since regaining consciousness.
He got high-lowed by a couple

109
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:42,173
of linebackers,
dropped like a rock.

110
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:44,259
Get X-ray in here
for a trauma series.

111
00:05:44,361 --> 00:05:46,406
Tenderness in the
left upper quadrant.

112
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:47,840
- I'm gonna need a CT.
- Got it.

113
00:05:47,864 --> 00:05:49,409
There's pain and
crepitance in the knee.

114
00:05:49,433 --> 00:05:52,800
Get an X-ray of the left
knee with the trauma series.

115
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:56,120
I saw that hit.
That was a bad hit.

116
00:05:56,222 --> 00:05:57,622
I knew it the minute I saw it.

117
00:05:57,724 --> 00:05:59,518
I knew before you even hit
the ground. That was bad.

118
00:05:59,542 --> 00:06:02,060
Hey. Hi, sweetheart.
And that's my boy!

119
00:06:02,162 --> 00:06:03,839
- He's very cute.
- Dr. Shepherd?

120
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,346
He's gonna be
fine. He'll be fine.

121
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:07,349
I can't have you in
here with the baby.

122
00:06:07,451 --> 00:06:08,817
Littlest high five in the world.

123
00:06:08,919 --> 00:06:10,518
We'll come and find you

124
00:06:10,621 --> 00:06:11,981
the second we
know what's going on.

125
00:06:12,022 --> 00:06:13,387
I love you, babe.

126
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:15,551
Don't give him too much
morphine. It makes him goofy.

127
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:18,677
- How great is that kid?
- He's pretty great.

128
00:06:20,013 --> 00:06:22,280
- You tell Sloan to move out?
- No.

129
00:06:22,365 --> 00:06:25,850
- Not that it's a bad idea.
- You're making her
feel like crap.

130
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:28,269
She said you wouldn't even
be alone in a room with her.

131
00:06:28,371 --> 00:06:30,071
- No...
- Why do I have to chaperone

132
00:06:30,173 --> 00:06:34,242
- the ultrasound?
- There's something wrong
with the baby.

133
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:37,045
See, right there,
on the left thigh?

134
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,880
Yeah. On his other ankle, too.

135
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:42,833
- Wait, it's a boy?
- I hadn't gotten that far.

136
00:06:42,936 --> 00:06:45,353
Sorry. Congratulations.

137
00:06:45,472 --> 00:06:48,673
There's a lot of swelling on the
right foot. It's very constricted.

138
00:06:48,775 --> 00:06:50,553
What the hell are
you talking about?

139
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:53,411
The baby's got strands of amniotic
tissue wrapped around his legs.

140
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:54,813
They're called amniotic bands.

141
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:57,075
There's a danger of them
compromising one of his limbs.

142
00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:00,501
So, what, one of his
legs is gonna, like, fall off?

143
00:07:00,603 --> 00:07:03,405
- That's worst-case scenario.
- He's gonna have stumps?

144
00:07:03,507 --> 00:07:06,090
We don't know what
we're dealing with yet,

145
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:08,560
and whatever it is, we're
gonna take care of it.

146
00:07:08,662 --> 00:07:11,329
I can't have a stumpy
baby. Can't you fix it?

147
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:14,015
- Um, I don't know.
- I have an idea.

148
00:07:14,117 --> 00:07:16,301
How about we don't
answer any patient questions

149
00:07:16,403 --> 00:07:18,536
with the phrase,
"Um, I don't know."

150
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:22,490
We're gonna fix it.
Let's get a fetal MRI.

151
00:07:22,593 --> 00:07:26,828
- I'm not sure...
- I wasn't talking to you. You're done.

152
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:28,813
I'll be right back.

153
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:39,307
Get me Addison Montgomery.

154
00:07:44,013 --> 00:07:45,013
I adore you.

155
00:07:45,114 --> 00:07:47,448
I was in the
middle of breakfast.

156
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:50,018
She had an MRI.
Right's worse than the left.

157
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,820
- I just need to say it once.
- Go ahead.

158
00:07:52,923 --> 00:07:54,822
Grandpa.

159
00:07:54,925 --> 00:07:57,825
- Grandpa, grandpa, grandpa.
- OK, that was four times.

160
00:07:57,928 --> 00:08:00,128
- Is it out of your system?
- I don't know.

161
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:04,015
Look at that, he thinks he's got
an opening behind Martin, then...

162
00:08:04,117 --> 00:08:07,451
- Back that up again.
- I'd never ask for
an autograph.

163
00:08:07,554 --> 00:08:09,966
But if he signed a consent form
and there's a copy lying around...

164
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:13,108
- Torres!
- What?

165
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:16,044
- Look who's here!
- You get lost on the freeway?

166
00:08:16,146 --> 00:08:18,496
- What are you doing here?
- Sloan's got a little something

167
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:20,347
- going on with the baby.
- She OK?

168
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:23,618
- We'll figure it out.
- I'm gonna go see
if they're ready.

169
00:08:23,736 --> 00:08:25,281
You know how long
I've been waiting?

170
00:08:25,305 --> 00:08:27,233
You pull his blood
out with leeches?

171
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:29,774
Ooh...

172
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:33,678
- She's perkier than usual.
- Divorce'll do that to you.

173
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,663
- Sad.
- She'll move on and be happy.

174
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:37,426
She needs somebody
to move on to.

175
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,301
That can't be so hard.

176
00:08:39,403 --> 00:08:42,286
Hey, wait. What about you?
Can't you find her someone?

177
00:08:42,388 --> 00:08:44,669
That guy from Oncology,
the cute one. Isn't he still here?

178
00:08:44,758 --> 00:08:47,637
- That's not my area.
- He used to play
basketball with him.

179
00:08:47,661 --> 00:08:49,888
- Dave.
- Torres should do it. They're friends.

180
00:08:49,912 --> 00:08:52,680
- She thinks I'm loopy.
- You are loopy.

181
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:55,367
Come on. It's
Bailey. She's lonely.

182
00:08:57,154 --> 00:08:58,786
Hey. He needs a transfusion.

183
00:08:58,888 --> 00:09:01,138
That splenic lac is
bleeding more than I thought.

184
00:09:01,241 --> 00:09:04,359
Take a look at his CTs and
come up with a game plan.

185
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,659
All set.

186
00:09:05,761 --> 00:09:08,096
- Ah.
- I'm coming with you.

187
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:13,451
You know Dave from
Oncology? He's single.

188
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,520
You wouldn't be starting
a conversation about

189
00:09:15,622 --> 00:09:18,506
- my personal life, would you?
- Bad idea? He's handsome.

190
00:09:18,608 --> 00:09:21,159
- Bad idea!
- OK.

191
00:09:21,261 --> 00:09:22,877
I tried.

192
00:09:23,997 --> 00:09:26,697
Hi, Ruthie. This is Dr. Yang.

193
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,611
She'll be performing
your surgery today.

194
00:09:28,635 --> 00:09:31,369
She's the best of the
best. You're gonna like her.

195
00:09:31,471 --> 00:09:34,639
- Good! I'm so glad to meet you!
- Hi.

196
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:38,159
I have a couple things
I want to discuss.

197
00:09:38,261 --> 00:09:40,895
- Of course, of course.
- I have allergies.

198
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:42,763
I know they write
them in the chart,

199
00:09:42,865 --> 00:09:44,832
but I find if you
don't tell everyone,

200
00:09:44,934 --> 00:09:46,934
it kind of gets
lost in the shuffle.

201
00:09:47,037 --> 00:09:50,572
- Yeah.
- Aspirin, ibuprofen,

202
00:09:50,674 --> 00:09:52,423
bananas, zucchini,

203
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:56,427
all forms of squash.
Pumpkin is a squash.

204
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:59,247
People forget that.
Latex, dust mites.

205
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:02,483
I asked the nurse
with the red hair

206
00:10:02,585 --> 00:10:04,085
for a new pillow.

207
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:06,037
I would also love
to get a new nurse,

208
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:08,790
because I think the redhead
brought back the old pillow

209
00:10:08,892 --> 00:10:11,476
with a new case and
it's making me sneezy.

210
00:10:11,578 --> 00:10:13,439
I was supposed to
get a mechanical valve,

211
00:10:13,463 --> 00:10:15,925
but I've been thinking about
the clicking noise they say

212
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:17,932
the mechanical valve makes...

213
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:21,285
That would be irritating. Don't
you think that might make you nuts?

214
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:24,855
I'm sorry, but a different valve
is a whole different procedure.

215
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:28,994
Yes, but I think the pig is
a better idea, the pig valve.

216
00:10:29,096 --> 00:10:31,546
It's organic. They
say they're very clean.

217
00:10:31,648 --> 00:10:35,583
All that business about, "You're
such a pig," that's just bad marketing.

218
00:10:35,685 --> 00:10:38,336
And this blanket,
this has a smell.

219
00:10:39,355 --> 00:10:41,790
Yeah. Like... I'm not
saying it's not clean.

220
00:10:41,892 --> 00:10:44,620
It's like a chemical of some
kind. It's chafing and causing...

221
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,294
Can you see my rash?

222
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:49,324
As the legs continue to grow,
the bands'll cut off his circulation.

223
00:10:49,348 --> 00:10:53,117
If we wait, we risk severe
damage to the left leg,

224
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,720
possible loss of
the right entirely.

225
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:59,574
But if we operate, 22
weeks, it's... still risky.

226
00:10:59,676 --> 00:11:01,756
If you don't operate, you're
not gonna kill the baby.

227
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:03,748
We can rehabilitate the
remaining part of his leg

228
00:11:03,846 --> 00:11:06,046
after he's born, and we
can fit him with a prosthesis.

229
00:11:06,149 --> 00:11:07,515
It's possible that he'll walk.

230
00:11:07,617 --> 00:11:10,801
- Oh, my God!
- Honey, we've got options here.

231
00:11:10,904 --> 00:11:14,688
If we operate, Dr. Montgomery can
remove the bands. He'll be just fine.

232
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:19,944
Or we can wait a few weeks
till he's bigger and stronger

233
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:22,747
and we know the
surgery's less risky.

234
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:26,584
Which one of you
did he sleep with?

235
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,120
Oh, not me.

236
00:11:29,222 --> 00:11:32,373
- You told her?
- She's my kid. We were bonding.

237
00:11:32,475 --> 00:11:35,526
That's not how you
bond with children!

238
00:11:35,628 --> 00:11:37,194
I'm still getting
the hang of it.

239
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:39,848
You're sure he didn't, like,
knock you up and leave you

240
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:41,983
with a child to raise on
your own or something?

241
00:11:42,085 --> 00:11:44,368
You're not really pissed
and trying to get revenge?

242
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,320
No! No.

243
00:11:46,422 --> 00:11:49,507
It was a long time ago, OK?

244
00:11:49,609 --> 00:11:51,642
The fact is, Mark,

245
00:11:51,745 --> 00:11:54,912
your father, is a good guy.
And I think you're a good kid.

246
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:57,615
I'm gonna do everything I
can to help you with your baby.

247
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:00,401
OK. Well, let's get these
things off his legs right now.

248
00:12:00,503 --> 00:12:02,120
I'll book an OR.

249
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:10,044
Stupid quarterback
only has a concussion.

250
00:12:10,147 --> 00:12:11,657
- Tragic.
- I know.

251
00:12:11,681 --> 00:12:14,516
I'm on his ortho stuff.
There's bound to be a surgery.

252
00:12:14,618 --> 00:12:17,218
- You wanna share?
- Why would I do that?

253
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,287
- 'Cause you like me.
- Not that much.

254
00:12:19,389 --> 00:12:20,488
Sure you do. Come on.

255
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:22,190
Let me scrub in

256
00:12:22,292 --> 00:12:25,626
and I'll take you out for
drinks afterwards and...

257
00:12:25,728 --> 00:12:27,011
You know.

258
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:32,533
Really?

259
00:12:33,236 --> 00:12:34,969
OK.

260
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:42,260
- What?
- "Let me take you
out for drinks

261
00:12:42,361 --> 00:12:44,728
and you know."
What's "you know"?

262
00:12:45,665 --> 00:12:47,092
- Whatever.
- It's sex.

263
00:12:47,116 --> 00:12:49,149
Charlie, get over it.

264
00:12:49,252 --> 00:12:52,069
You're trading sex for
surgery. That's prostitution.

265
00:12:52,172 --> 00:12:53,812
Is that the part I'm
supposed to get over?

266
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:56,018
- Are you calling me a whore?
- Explain what "you know" means.

267
00:12:56,042 --> 00:12:59,076
I'm messing with him.
Karev knows it, and I know it.

268
00:12:59,178 --> 00:13:00,945
- He's gonna want to collect.
- Charlie,

269
00:13:01,047 --> 00:13:03,848
go find something
else to worry about.

270
00:13:17,096 --> 00:13:20,814
Dr. Bailey, this is
Dr. Stanton from Radiology.

271
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:23,084
Rob, Miranda.

272
00:13:23,186 --> 00:13:25,564
Rob was looking over Tom's
CT, I thought he should talk to you.

273
00:13:25,588 --> 00:13:27,005
- OK.
- Rob's new here.

274
00:13:27,107 --> 00:13:29,151
I thought you might give
him a tour of the hospital

275
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:30,858
while you discuss the CT.

276
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:37,732
Excuse me. What are you doing?

277
00:13:37,834 --> 00:13:40,012
You spent Christmas
with me and Meredith.

278
00:13:40,036 --> 00:13:43,588
- That can't be what you want.
- True, but I do have a patient

279
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,389
that I have to do a
follow-up on right now.

280
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:48,675
- I don't have time to...
- I can do it. Have fun. Take care.

281
00:13:48,778 --> 00:13:50,611
Have a good tour.

282
00:13:50,713 --> 00:13:55,066
- You want to show me the scan?
- How about we look at it
over lunch?

283
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:01,139
I'm in the middle of a divorce.

284
00:14:01,241 --> 00:14:04,704
People call me The Nazi, and it's
not because of my ice-blue eyes.

285
00:14:04,728 --> 00:14:07,979
I spend 12 hours a day
carving people up and I like it.

286
00:14:08,081 --> 00:14:09,664
I have a child.

287
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:12,400
And I have no room
for casual anything.

288
00:14:12,502 --> 00:14:15,870
I'm angry all the time
and deeply confused,

289
00:14:15,972 --> 00:14:18,873
because a lot of people in my
life have let me down recently,

290
00:14:18,975 --> 00:14:21,942
and one of them was me. It's
devastating, but not completely

291
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:24,729
because it turns out I like
sleeping crosswise in the bed

292
00:14:24,831 --> 00:14:26,292
and not having to shave my legs.

293
00:14:26,316 --> 00:14:28,799
My three year old
used to be potty trained,

294
00:14:28,902 --> 00:14:32,670
and now he isn't because his
father no longer lives with us

295
00:14:32,772 --> 00:14:34,684
and his world no
longer makes sense

296
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:37,274
and the only thing he thinks
he can control is his bladder,

297
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:41,578
so he urinates in a lot of places
you wish he wouldn't urinate.

298
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,198
You want lunch or you
wanna show me the scan?

299
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:52,023
Mr. Morris, I'm Dr. Shepherd.

300
00:14:52,124 --> 00:14:54,224
I'll be filling in for
Dr. Bailey today.

301
00:14:54,326 --> 00:14:56,126
- You're here for a follow-up?
- Yeah.

302
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:58,040
I had my gallbladder
out a couple months ago.

303
00:14:58,064 --> 00:14:59,964
Months? You're still
getting follow-ups?

304
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:01,826
- I am. Once a week.
- Once a week?

305
00:15:01,885 --> 00:15:04,485
Yeah. Dr. B says she
just wants to make sure

306
00:15:04,587 --> 00:15:07,188
- I'm in tiptop shape.
- Dr. Webber did your surgery?

307
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:09,840
Yeah, chief of
surgery. Fancy, huh?

308
00:15:09,943 --> 00:15:12,643
You guys are the best.
People say a lot of crap about

309
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:15,496
health care, but
they've never been here.

310
00:15:16,566 --> 00:15:20,184
- You take care of people.
- We certainly do.

311
00:15:20,287 --> 00:15:24,955
Dr. B was all worried 'cause I turned
yellow after my first surgery. See?

312
00:15:26,726 --> 00:15:29,393
But it went away. I'm fine now.

313
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:32,664
You want to look at my scar
or wait till after I pee in the cup?

314
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:37,167
Dr. Altman. The patient's no longer
interested in the mechanical valve.

315
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:40,438
I couldn't give you a total
unadulterated dream case.

316
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:42,890
- People would talk.
- I just spent hours prepping

317
00:15:42,992 --> 00:15:46,126
for the mechanical. A pig
valve is a whole different surgery!

318
00:15:46,228 --> 00:15:50,231
Two for the price of one. Think
about how much you're learning.

319
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:52,049
You want me to get someone else?

320
00:15:53,987 --> 00:15:56,437
No.

321
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:58,651
It's a concussion, no worse
than you've seen before.

322
00:15:58,675 --> 00:16:00,708
Nothing we need
to go in and fix.

323
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:04,095
Initially, we thought the injury
to your spleen'd resolve itself,

324
00:16:04,197 --> 00:16:05,330
but it's bleeding too much.

325
00:16:05,432 --> 00:16:07,665
Dr. Bailey needs to remove
it as soon as possible.

326
00:16:07,767 --> 00:16:09,847
The surgery is gonna have
you out for a couple weeks.

327
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:12,420
But you'll be back in
the game for next season.

328
00:16:18,027 --> 00:16:20,544
- Tom?
- I can't... I can't breathe!

329
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:22,566
- Get some oxygen!
- I can't breathe!

330
00:16:22,665 --> 00:16:24,766
Get a crash cart! Tom...

331
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:33,391
Let's get an EKG just in case.

332
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:35,426
Tom, have you had
a panic attack before?

333
00:16:35,528 --> 00:16:37,444
I'm fine.

334
00:16:38,014 --> 00:16:39,781
It's just, uh...

335
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:43,618
- It's nothing.
- There's Daddy!

336
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,037
- How's my guy?
- He's fine.

337
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:47,621
How's my guy?

338
00:16:47,723 --> 00:16:51,075
- He was...
- Brain's OK.

339
00:16:52,278 --> 00:16:55,046
But they gotta
cut my belly open.

340
00:16:55,148 --> 00:16:58,566
- I can't play till next season.
- Honey...

341
00:16:58,668 --> 00:17:02,320
Don't worry, next season
will be here before you know it.

342
00:17:10,263 --> 00:17:13,614
- What's the deal
with you and Reed?
- Nothing.

343
00:17:13,716 --> 00:17:15,928
You're not trading
her surgery for sex?

344
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:18,969
- Give me a break.
- Because if you are,
it's gross.

345
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:21,605
If I sleep with her,
it's 'cause I want to.

346
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,027
You look me in
the eye and tell me

347
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:25,109
Derek never threw a
craniotomy your way

348
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:27,811
after the two of you spent an
hour in the on-call room? Please.

349
00:17:27,897 --> 00:17:30,897
I know it may not feel like
it, but you are still married.

350
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,077
And Izzie...

351
00:17:32,101 --> 00:17:33,861
You know what? I'm
done worrying about Izzie.

352
00:17:33,903 --> 00:17:36,504
She sure as hell
ain't worried about me.

353
00:17:38,441 --> 00:17:39,840
This is the old Alex.

354
00:17:39,942 --> 00:17:43,844
Sleeping with some random
person because you're angry and hurt.

355
00:17:43,946 --> 00:17:46,998
- That's what you always did.
- Then we grew up and
got married.

356
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,800
Turns out your stupid Post-it
is ten times the marriage

357
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:52,436
my church wedding ever
got me. I'm moving on.

358
00:17:58,111 --> 00:18:00,155
Hey. Tom Kates is
having panic attacks?

359
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:02,179
Yeah, I don't know
why. He's not talking.

360
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:04,682
I took care of your
chole patient. It's all good.

361
00:18:04,784 --> 00:18:07,652
- Thanks.
- He's getting high-class care.

362
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:10,788
Six visits with a surgeon? A
nurse practitioner can do this.

363
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:13,223
I like to do after-care myself.

364
00:18:13,326 --> 00:18:16,427
He wasn't even your patient. He
was the chief's. There was an error.

365
00:18:16,529 --> 00:18:18,140
- He's fine.
- So why all the...?

366
00:18:18,164 --> 00:18:20,547
I have a thing for him, OK?

367
00:18:22,885 --> 00:18:26,854
- Sheldon Morris?
- He caught my eye.

368
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:30,441
Sheldon has a quality

369
00:18:30,543 --> 00:18:35,062
that I'm... drawn to. I...

370
00:18:35,164 --> 00:18:39,333
I can't put my finger
on what it is exactly.

371
00:18:39,435 --> 00:18:44,588
Sure. Sure. Want
to keep his picture?

372
00:18:51,097 --> 00:18:53,964
Do you know what my sister
had for lunch today? Pork chops.

373
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:57,134
I watched her eat. I
didn't feel any kinship.

374
00:18:57,236 --> 00:18:59,186
With the pig.

375
00:18:59,288 --> 00:19:02,589
I think the pig valve
may be the wrong choice.

376
00:19:03,743 --> 00:19:06,928
You feel more kinship with cows?

377
00:19:07,897 --> 00:19:10,414
- I don't know.
- Mrs. Carlin,

378
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:12,867
we've prepared the
porcine valve replacement.

379
00:19:12,969 --> 00:19:15,553
A bovine replacement is
a whole different surgery.

380
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:18,289
Like the mechanical valve
was a whole different surgery.

381
00:19:18,391 --> 00:19:21,758
Do you think it's possible I could
see the valves? The pig and the cow?

382
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,078
Maybe then I could
recognize one as more familiar.

383
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:27,214
We don't do that. We don't
march the parts around the hospital.

384
00:19:27,316 --> 00:19:29,349
Maybe we should call
this off. Can I do that?

385
00:19:29,452 --> 00:19:31,935
- If you're not comfortable...
- No, no, no.

386
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:34,438
I mean, I can get the valves.

387
00:19:34,523 --> 00:19:38,159
And I'll bring them here. OK?

388
00:19:38,261 --> 00:19:40,378
Oh... You're so wonderful!

389
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,780
- You really are.
- Great.

390
00:19:46,302 --> 00:19:49,369
- She's so wonderful.
- She is.

391
00:19:52,842 --> 00:19:55,810
Richard, Tom Kates
needs a splenectomy.

392
00:19:55,912 --> 00:19:58,345
Any chance I can get
you to do the procedure?

393
00:19:58,464 --> 00:20:00,781
Well, I asked Bailey
to take over my service.

394
00:20:00,883 --> 00:20:02,616
With the merger and all...

395
00:20:02,735 --> 00:20:04,635
It's a high-profile patient.

396
00:20:04,737 --> 00:20:07,288
I thought you could
make an exception.

397
00:20:09,174 --> 00:20:10,775
Sure.

398
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:19,850
- You must have
extras lying around.
- We don't.

399
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:21,618
You never drop one?

400
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:25,039
Open up the box and see that
the pig has a cholesterol problem?

401
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:27,658
- Let me check in the back.
- OK.

402
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,805
She thinks maybe one
of them will speak to her.

403
00:20:29,829 --> 00:20:31,828
- It's ringing.
- I'm prepping

404
00:20:31,931 --> 00:20:34,065
for three different
surgeries in one day,

405
00:20:34,167 --> 00:20:36,094
chasing animal parts
all over the hospital.

406
00:20:36,118 --> 00:20:39,186
Teddy thinks it's hysterical,
but this may actually kill me.

407
00:20:39,288 --> 00:20:41,900
Maybe one of them'll speak to
her. There're pros and cons for each.

408
00:20:41,924 --> 00:20:45,142
At the end of the day,
it's a gut thing. Pig or cow.

409
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:48,579
It's not a gut thing. It's a
decision based on fact and reason.

410
00:20:48,681 --> 00:20:52,483
- Hey! Where are my parts?
- Izzie, it's me.

411
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:54,901
I know you want space,
but you can't have space,

412
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:57,221
because Alex might be moving on.

413
00:20:57,323 --> 00:21:00,118
Come back and work in the clinic!
You're throwing your career away!

414
00:21:00,142 --> 00:21:02,275
- Cristina...
- She got fired from surgery,

415
00:21:02,378 --> 00:21:04,811
- not all medicine.
- Ignore her. Just call me back.

416
00:21:04,914 --> 00:21:06,347
OK. Bye.

417
00:21:08,534 --> 00:21:12,069
There. That wasn't
so difficult, was it?

418
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:16,924
OK.

419
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:18,737
Got the first band.
Let's move down so I can

420
00:21:18,761 --> 00:21:21,512
take a look at the second.

421
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:24,397
- Like that?
- Good.

422
00:21:24,499 --> 00:21:27,668
Why... can't I grab his leg?

423
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:30,471
- Problem?
- No, it's just that
one of the bands

424
00:21:30,573 --> 00:21:32,155
is holding the leg in place.

425
00:21:32,257 --> 00:21:34,724
It's a little difficult
to get around.

426
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:36,821
Can you move the
ultrasound up here?

427
00:21:36,845 --> 00:21:38,763
- Oh, come on.
- What's the matter?

428
00:21:38,865 --> 00:21:42,015
Her uterine arteries are
engorged. But the only way in

429
00:21:42,117 --> 00:21:43,968
is in between them.

430
00:21:45,087 --> 00:21:47,371
OK, I'm gonna need
another trocar. Hold this?

431
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:50,057
You sure you have enough
room? Those arteries are huge.

432
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:52,726
That's why I'm gonna be
very, very careful. Scalpel.

433
00:21:52,828 --> 00:21:54,428
What happens if you nick them?

434
00:21:55,514 --> 00:21:56,754
Dr. Grey?

435
00:21:57,784 --> 00:21:59,650
She could bleed
out. They both could.

436
00:21:59,752 --> 00:22:01,330
I don't like it. It's
too dangerous.

437
00:22:01,354 --> 00:22:03,749
Mark, I've assessed
the risk factors.

438
00:22:03,773 --> 00:22:06,657
I'm 95 percent confident I
can get around the arteries.

439
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:08,503
I'm choosing to
continue my surgery.

440
00:22:08,527 --> 00:22:10,494
I don't like the
other five percent.

441
00:22:10,596 --> 00:22:14,414
You hit any one of those, she
bleeds out right on this table.

442
00:22:15,535 --> 00:22:17,479
Look, you're
nervous, I get that.

443
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:20,971
I'm a surgeon, and I'm looking at a
time bomb in a uterus. Shut it down!

444
00:22:21,073 --> 00:22:22,890
Now, Addison!

445
00:22:27,396 --> 00:22:29,229
Let's close her up.

446
00:22:38,825 --> 00:22:41,091
- Good to go?
- Yeah.

447
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:42,987
You baby-sitting?
'Cause I'm new at this.

448
00:22:43,011 --> 00:22:45,846
- Where's the chief?
- I don't know. Check his office.

449
00:22:45,948 --> 00:22:47,481
He said he was
gonna do this surgery.

450
00:22:47,583 --> 00:22:49,428
Then he told me
he didn't have time

451
00:22:49,452 --> 00:22:50,732
and asked if I would do it,

452
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:52,381
which I was planning
on in the first place.

453
00:22:52,405 --> 00:22:55,288
- So I said yes.
- He said something about

454
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:57,324
a budget meeting. I
think he's pretty swamped.

455
00:22:57,426 --> 00:23:00,410
If he's got time to watch old surgical
films with you, he's not swamped.

456
00:23:00,512 --> 00:23:02,229
What the hell is going on?

457
00:23:02,331 --> 00:23:04,443
The chole patient,
your boyfriend,

458
00:23:04,467 --> 00:23:07,645
it was the chief's mistake. He
hasn't touched a patient since then.

459
00:23:07,669 --> 00:23:11,388
- He's been busy
with the merger.
- I've heard that story before.

460
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:13,424
What is going on?

461
00:23:17,913 --> 00:23:21,215
It is not my job to get
involved in his personal life.

462
00:23:21,317 --> 00:23:24,668
Just like it's not your job
to get involved in mine.

463
00:23:29,308 --> 00:23:31,008
Ten blade.

464
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:35,613
I made a judgment call,
you didn't like it, I'm sorry.

465
00:23:35,715 --> 00:23:38,382
You threw me on a plane in
the middle of my morning coffee

466
00:23:38,484 --> 00:23:41,285
- because you
wanted my judgment.
- It was risky.

467
00:23:41,387 --> 00:23:44,789
That's not your call
to make in my OR!

468
00:23:44,891 --> 00:23:46,356
You acted like a father.

469
00:23:46,459 --> 00:23:48,270
Why do you think they
don't let parents in the room

470
00:23:48,294 --> 00:23:51,511
- during an operation?
- I'm not her father, Addison.

471
00:23:51,613 --> 00:23:52,853
Biologically, yes,

472
00:23:52,915 --> 00:23:56,550
but... I just met the
kid. I'm helping out.

473
00:23:56,652 --> 00:23:58,735
You reacted like a parent.

474
00:23:58,838 --> 00:24:01,538
Now, I don't know
when, I don't know how,

475
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:05,209
but at some point, you
became a dad to that little urchin,

476
00:24:05,311 --> 00:24:07,043
because you just
lost it in my OR,

477
00:24:07,146 --> 00:24:11,148
and Mark Sloan never
loses it in the OR, not ever.

478
00:24:12,919 --> 00:24:15,219
Yes, it was risky. And
yes, most surgeons

479
00:24:15,321 --> 00:24:17,641
would've jumped ship at the
sight of the engorged arteries.

480
00:24:17,723 --> 00:24:21,074
But I am not most surgeons.
And neither are you.

481
00:24:21,176 --> 00:24:26,679
We can try this again.

482
00:24:26,782 --> 00:24:28,565
With you in the waiting room.

483
00:24:30,519 --> 00:24:33,721
It's too risky.
She's just a kid.

484
00:24:35,023 --> 00:24:38,358
Well, have Morrison monitor
the bands as the baby grows.

485
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:40,194
It might be OK.

486
00:24:40,295 --> 00:24:43,163
I gotta go. I have
patients at home.

487
00:24:45,267 --> 00:24:47,134
Congratulations.

488
00:24:47,236 --> 00:24:49,036
You're a parent.

489
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:09,306
- Neither one is speaking to me.
- For God's...

490
00:25:09,408 --> 00:25:11,048
- Are they speaking to you?
- They aren't.

491
00:25:11,126 --> 00:25:14,794
If I put your own valve in front of
you, it wouldn't speak to you either.

492
00:25:14,896 --> 00:25:17,481
I have a cousin. His wife is a
cardiologist. I should call her.

493
00:25:17,583 --> 00:25:19,877
No, no, no! No more calls.

494
00:25:19,901 --> 00:25:22,080
This is about you
and your heart.

495
00:25:22,104 --> 00:25:25,706
You need to use your instinct
and make a decision. Right now.

496
00:25:25,808 --> 00:25:27,557
- Pig or cow.
- But I...

497
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:29,259
Pig or cow. Pig or cow!

498
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:31,281
Don't think! Just...
pig or cow! Go! Now!

499
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:32,729
Pig! No.

500
00:25:32,831 --> 00:25:34,298
Cow!

501
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,300
Pig! Pig! Pig. Pig.

502
00:25:40,773 --> 00:25:42,389
Pig.

503
00:25:44,526 --> 00:25:45,592
Procedure went well.

504
00:25:45,694 --> 00:25:48,128
You're gonna be back
on your feet in no time.

505
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:49,880
Great.

506
00:25:54,703 --> 00:25:56,253
You're scared to play.

507
00:25:57,256 --> 00:25:59,639
You thought you were done.

508
00:25:59,741 --> 00:26:03,276
And when I said you'd be
back in the game next season,

509
00:26:03,379 --> 00:26:05,412
you panicked.

510
00:26:07,616 --> 00:26:12,452
Um... I used to be able
to block out the fear,

511
00:26:12,554 --> 00:26:15,155
but ever since Des was
born, I'm on the field,

512
00:26:15,257 --> 00:26:19,692
my heart starts racing.
I can't catch my breath.

513
00:26:19,794 --> 00:26:22,396
I look at the guys who
played their whole careers,

514
00:26:22,498 --> 00:26:25,965
hit so many times they can
barely remember their own names.

515
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:31,638
I'm scared he's gonna
grow up without a dad.

516
00:26:32,908 --> 00:26:37,210
- I'm scared all the time.
- It's a natural reaction.

517
00:26:37,312 --> 00:26:38,462
You're a father.

518
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:43,433
- Why don't you retire?
- Come on.

519
00:26:43,535 --> 00:26:47,321
Two years into a
pro career? I can't.

520
00:26:47,423 --> 00:26:50,841
I know I'm not a soldier
in Iraq or a rocket scientist

521
00:26:50,926 --> 00:26:52,793
or any kind of real hero.

522
00:26:52,895 --> 00:26:56,863
I know I'm just
some big, dumb jock.

523
00:26:56,965 --> 00:27:01,968
But I'm a big, dumb jock
the entire city roots for.

524
00:27:02,071 --> 00:27:06,623
Kids. Guys on the street.

525
00:27:06,725 --> 00:27:08,908
I can't let them down.

526
00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:11,511
This is the tradeoff.

527
00:27:11,613 --> 00:27:13,630
- I get hit.
- Mmm...

528
00:27:13,732 --> 00:27:17,184
Some guys can't even feed
their families, you know?

529
00:27:17,285 --> 00:27:20,486
Some guys are soldiers in Iraq.

530
00:27:20,589 --> 00:27:22,622
They get shot at.

531
00:27:23,525 --> 00:27:25,792
So I'm not complaining.

532
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:29,996
I'm just... I'm
scared of the hits.

533
00:27:32,551 --> 00:27:36,370
I wanna be able to
remember who my kid is.

534
00:27:44,629 --> 00:27:46,547
OK. No more bubbles.

535
00:27:46,649 --> 00:27:48,881
OK. Pressures are
good. Let's come off.

536
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:52,135
Decannulating.

537
00:27:52,238 --> 00:27:55,200
I told Torres she had to let
you scrub in if she was cutting.

538
00:27:55,224 --> 00:27:59,776
- Cool!
- Book an on-call room.

539
00:27:59,879 --> 00:28:02,062
What...? What
happened to drinks first?

540
00:28:02,164 --> 00:28:06,383
It's kind of a waste of
time, right? Cut to the chase.

541
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,386
Hey, Reed.

542
00:28:09,488 --> 00:28:11,705
- Do you know Izzie Stevens?
- Grey.

543
00:28:11,807 --> 00:28:14,574
Yes. I met her
before she got fired.

544
00:28:14,676 --> 00:28:18,495
You know she's Alex's wife.
And she's not here right now,

545
00:28:18,597 --> 00:28:21,131
- but they're still married.
- Meredith, shut up!

546
00:28:21,233 --> 00:28:23,734
No. Some people think
you're divorced, and you're not.

547
00:28:23,836 --> 00:28:27,104
How about you shut up long enough
to watch your friend tank her valve.

548
00:28:27,189 --> 00:28:29,990
- How...? What?
<i>- She's tachycardic.</i>

549
00:28:30,092 --> 00:28:31,274
Suction. Take this.

550
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,161
Laps, I need more laps.
Someone get me a sponge stick.

551
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:37,114
Um...

552
00:28:37,216 --> 00:28:40,801
I'm having difficulty
locating the bleeder.

553
00:28:40,903 --> 00:28:42,769
- Dr. Altman?
- Keep looking.

554
00:28:42,871 --> 00:28:44,188
<i>BP's dropping!</i>

555
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:48,175
How come Altman's
not doing anything?

556
00:28:48,277 --> 00:28:50,794
Suction! More suction.

557
00:28:56,969 --> 00:29:00,170
Knee looks like crap, but
that's been true for a long time.

558
00:29:00,272 --> 00:29:02,072
He should be able to
play through the pain.

559
00:29:02,174 --> 00:29:05,792
What if he can't? What
about a knee replacement?

560
00:29:05,895 --> 00:29:07,377
Right now.

561
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:12,682
He needs to stop. How about
we make it so it's not his idea?

562
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:18,288
- Systolic's down to 80!
- I could suture directly
or clamp.

563
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:20,724
- I don't know which to do.
- I don't know either.

564
00:29:20,826 --> 00:29:22,926
My guess is if you
came and looked at it,

565
00:29:23,012 --> 00:29:25,595
- you'd have a better idea.
- I'm sure that's true,

566
00:29:25,697 --> 00:29:28,009
- but I'm not the one operating.
- This's a lot of blood.

567
00:29:28,033 --> 00:29:30,200
- She's crashing!
- You're over-thinking it.

568
00:29:30,302 --> 00:29:31,913
- Dr. Yang?
- Look at the aorta.

569
00:29:31,937 --> 00:29:33,498
- What does it tell you?
- I have two options.

570
00:29:33,522 --> 00:29:35,689
- I don't know which one to do!
- This is crazy.

571
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:37,891
- Why isn't she helping her?
- How's it going?

572
00:29:37,993 --> 00:29:42,111
Yang's killing her patient and
Altman's reading <i>The Atlantic Monthly.</i>

573
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:48,152
If I suture, it might not hold.
If I clamp, it could rupture.

574
00:29:48,254 --> 00:29:51,188
- BP's tanking.
- What the hell are you doing?

575
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:53,790
- I'm teaching. She's learning.
- She needs help.

576
00:29:53,892 --> 00:29:56,688
She may be too proud to say it, but
how about we don't let this patient die

577
00:29:56,712 --> 00:29:59,996
- and give her a hand anyhow?
- She asked, she's not
that proud.

578
00:30:00,098 --> 00:30:02,532
And I said no. This
patient is not going to die.

579
00:30:02,635 --> 00:30:05,234
- She's going to
save the patient.
- Pig or cow.

580
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,948
If you sit on your hands
because you're angry...

581
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:08,967
- Get over yourself.
- That patient...

582
00:30:08,991 --> 00:30:12,091
Dr. Hunt, you are blowing my
concentration! Get out of my OR!

583
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:16,613
Pig or cow, pig or
cow, pig or cow...

584
00:30:16,715 --> 00:30:17,864
Pig! Clamp.

585
00:30:17,966 --> 00:30:20,033
Three-oh wool pledget.

586
00:30:22,104 --> 00:30:25,104
Dr. Torres and I think
your knee needs replacing.

587
00:30:25,206 --> 00:30:26,606
That's been true since college.

588
00:30:26,708 --> 00:30:31,778
There's too much degeneration.
The joint is completely shot.

589
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,080
You need a unicondylar repair

590
00:30:33,181 --> 00:30:34,981
or you may lose
the ability to walk.

591
00:30:35,049 --> 00:30:38,035
Knee replacement'll take
me out of the game. Forever.

592
00:30:39,121 --> 00:30:40,720
Exactly.

593
00:30:49,314 --> 00:30:51,815
OK, it's coming up.

594
00:30:51,917 --> 00:30:53,533
Look, right there!

595
00:30:54,503 --> 00:30:56,169
Look at that.

596
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:59,506
That's the minute we knew
your mother was different.

597
00:30:59,608 --> 00:31:01,608
That other hand
holding the retractor?

598
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:04,911
That's Garber. He was the
chief of surgery back then.

599
00:31:06,232 --> 00:31:08,181
No one could believe it.

600
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:10,834
She walked in that
room a resident,

601
00:31:10,936 --> 00:31:13,603
and walked out a legend.

602
00:31:21,613 --> 00:31:23,657
Derek was worried
when you didn't show up

603
00:31:23,681 --> 00:31:26,182
for the Tom Kates surgery.

604
00:31:26,285 --> 00:31:29,920
Derek worries. It makes him
a good guy. Look, look, look.

605
00:31:33,775 --> 00:31:38,027
If Dr. Montgomery had
hit it during the procedure...

606
00:31:39,364 --> 00:31:40,797
It's dangerous.

607
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:44,668
What about that band
that's squeezing his thigh?

608
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:47,164
- He's not gonna have a knee?
- Sloan, you could have died.

609
00:31:47,188 --> 00:31:49,539
- I can't have a gimpy kid.
- I know I haven't been

610
00:31:49,641 --> 00:31:52,776
your father for long, but if
you say "gimp" one more time,

611
00:31:52,878 --> 00:31:55,462
- I'm gonna smack you.
- You don't get it.

612
00:31:55,564 --> 00:31:58,298
He needs legs! OK?

613
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:01,517
He doesn't have a dad!
He's got a stupid, slutty mom!

614
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:03,219
Don't you see?

615
00:32:03,322 --> 00:32:05,906
I've already hurt him enough
by giving him me as a mother.

616
00:32:06,008 --> 00:32:07,941
- He needs feet!
- Sloan...

617
00:32:08,043 --> 00:32:10,077
I don't know how to
take care of any baby.

618
00:32:10,179 --> 00:32:12,696
OK? I can't have one
that's hurt. I can't handle it.

619
00:32:12,798 --> 00:32:15,098
My mom doesn't even talk to me.

620
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,049
I'm doing this alone.

621
00:32:17,151 --> 00:32:19,670
Please.

622
00:32:20,339 --> 00:32:23,006
Listen. You're not stupid.

623
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:26,192
And you're not slutty.

624
00:32:27,095 --> 00:32:29,896
The Sloans...

625
00:32:29,998 --> 00:32:34,784
are a... passionate people.

626
00:32:34,886 --> 00:32:37,454
You dragged yourself across
the country so you could get help

627
00:32:37,555 --> 00:32:40,090
taking care of this baby.

628
00:32:40,191 --> 00:32:43,944
That's not being stupid.
That's being a mom.

629
00:32:44,062 --> 00:32:46,663
I'm not gonna let
anything happen to you.

630
00:32:46,765 --> 00:32:48,564
Or the baby.

631
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:52,785
Go to LA.

632
00:32:52,887 --> 00:32:56,256
Addison said 95 percent.
That's not that bad.

633
00:32:56,358 --> 00:32:57,690
Let her do the surgery.

634
00:33:01,814 --> 00:33:04,131
Looks like we're going to LA.

635
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:09,999
You're not gonna do this alone.

636
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:13,389
Hey.

637
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:15,975
Stay. After the baby's born.

638
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:18,878
Live with me and Lexie.
Raise the baby with us.

639
00:33:19,865 --> 00:33:22,099
I don't know anything
about being a dad,

640
00:33:22,201 --> 00:33:24,634
you don't know
about being a mom.

641
00:33:25,471 --> 00:33:28,171
Maybe we could...

642
00:33:28,273 --> 00:33:30,424
figure it all out together.

643
00:33:30,526 --> 00:33:33,209
- Really?
- Yeah.

644
00:33:34,413 --> 00:33:36,012
OK!

645
00:33:45,924 --> 00:33:47,624
Drill, please.

646
00:33:48,843 --> 00:33:50,777
Are you sure there's
nothing I can do to help?

647
00:33:50,879 --> 00:33:52,279
Uh, no.

648
00:33:52,381 --> 00:33:54,597
So I'm not gonna get to
do anything in this surgery?

649
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:56,516
Not worth what you paid for it?

650
00:33:56,618 --> 00:33:58,702
- Shut up.
- You guys are

651
00:33:58,804 --> 00:34:00,932
worked up about how none
of you get to operate anymore,

652
00:34:00,956 --> 00:34:03,390
but you know
what? At some point,

653
00:34:03,492 --> 00:34:05,703
you'll log enough
hours with a scalpel.

654
00:34:05,727 --> 00:34:08,161
At some point,
you'll be surgeons.

655
00:34:08,263 --> 00:34:11,797
And one day, you'll
look up and realize

656
00:34:11,899 --> 00:34:14,534
there's more in the
world than cutting.

657
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:18,855
Tom Kates' career is ending.

658
00:34:18,957 --> 00:34:20,718
That is what's
happening in this room.

659
00:34:20,742 --> 00:34:22,091
So could you, for one second,

660
00:34:22,193 --> 00:34:26,513
think about something other
than yourselves? Bone saw.

661
00:34:26,615 --> 00:34:30,116
I can't believe I'm taking out the
best quarterback Seattle's ever seen.

662
00:34:30,219 --> 00:34:34,587
You're not. He was out of
the game a long time ago.

663
00:34:45,183 --> 00:34:46,449
I would have stepped in.

664
00:34:46,551 --> 00:34:48,162
I would not have let
that patient get hurt.

665
00:34:48,186 --> 00:34:50,537
- I know that.
- She needs to be pushed.

666
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:52,399
She's like a racehorse.
You need to push her.

667
00:34:52,474 --> 00:34:55,491
- Otherwise,
she's gonna lose her mind.
- I know, Teddy.

668
00:34:58,263 --> 00:35:01,497
So nothing else was
going on in that room?

669
00:35:09,741 --> 00:35:11,975
Owen...

670
00:35:23,522 --> 00:35:24,522
You ready to pay up?

671
00:35:24,623 --> 00:35:27,056
That was the lamest
assist in history.

672
00:35:27,158 --> 00:35:30,443
- Hardly worth...
- Oh... Oh... A deal's a deal.

673
00:35:32,764 --> 00:35:35,281
Look, there might have
been a little misunderstanding

674
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:38,518
about what "you know" means.

675
00:35:40,606 --> 00:35:44,007
I don't trade surgery for sex.

676
00:35:44,877 --> 00:35:49,813
If you want sex, ask for it.

677
00:35:49,915 --> 00:35:53,283
If you want surgery, go kiss
an attending's ass, not mine.

678
00:35:55,370 --> 00:35:57,136
Hey, hey, hey! Whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

679
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:59,623
Hey, this is illegal and immoral

680
00:35:59,725 --> 00:36:03,042
and... you two should be
ashamed of yourselves.

681
00:36:03,145 --> 00:36:05,678
Charlie, go to hell!

682
00:36:10,035 --> 00:36:12,752
How am I the bad guy here?

683
00:36:15,957 --> 00:36:18,074
I should have asked you first,

684
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:20,676
but I was so excited,

685
00:36:20,778 --> 00:36:23,096
and I was so sure
it was the right thing.

686
00:36:23,198 --> 00:36:25,648
And you know why? 'Cause of you.

687
00:36:26,701 --> 00:36:29,719
Since you, I know, for
the first time in my life,

688
00:36:29,821 --> 00:36:32,872
- what the right thing is.
- I'm happy for you.

689
00:36:32,974 --> 00:36:34,674
I really am.

690
00:36:34,776 --> 00:36:38,445
Something happened
today. You became a dad.

691
00:36:38,547 --> 00:36:41,864
A real one. And
Sloan, against all odds,

692
00:36:41,966 --> 00:36:44,401
became a mom.

693
00:36:44,503 --> 00:36:46,853
But I didn't.

694
00:36:46,955 --> 00:36:49,433
I was barely ready
to move in with you,

695
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:52,275
never mind your
daughter and a grandbaby.

696
00:36:52,377 --> 00:36:55,045
I just... I don't want this.

697
00:36:55,147 --> 00:36:57,547
You wanted to give
your liver to your dad.

698
00:36:57,649 --> 00:36:59,583
This is what you
do for family, right?

699
00:36:59,685 --> 00:37:02,352
I understand why
you're doing it.

700
00:37:02,454 --> 00:37:04,820
I just don't understand
why I'm doing it.

701
00:37:06,358 --> 00:37:07,841
I think you're doing it for me.

702
00:37:07,943 --> 00:37:10,137
Don't make me out
to be the selfish one.

703
00:37:10,161 --> 00:37:11,905
You don't get to
unilaterally decide

704
00:37:11,929 --> 00:37:15,265
to let a teenager and her
infant move into our house.

705
00:37:15,367 --> 00:37:18,484
We'll get a bigger
place. She needs us.

706
00:37:20,121 --> 00:37:24,190
Lexie, I thought I missed this.

707
00:37:25,293 --> 00:37:27,677
This is a chance for me.

708
00:37:27,779 --> 00:37:31,080
Don't make me choose
between you and her.

709
00:37:32,951 --> 00:37:34,984
Why?

710
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:37,203
'Cause you'll choose her?

711
00:37:40,274 --> 00:37:41,874
Yeah.

712
00:37:42,877 --> 00:37:44,711
I'll choose her.

713
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:57,140
I think our
relationship just ended.

714
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:16,409
Something's going on with
the chief, I can't figure it out.

715
00:38:19,081 --> 00:38:22,765
I think he's scared to
operate. Is that possible?

716
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:29,005
You don't know or
you're not gonna tell me?

717
00:38:38,383 --> 00:38:40,716
Did you see that?
I'm holding the heart,

718
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:43,552
I feel it almost starting
to fibrillate in my hand!

719
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:46,790
I mean, piss-poor aortic
tissue, possibly irreparable,

720
00:38:46,891 --> 00:38:48,591
and then bam!

721
00:38:48,694 --> 00:38:50,476
Sutures hold, and it comes back!

722
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:52,745
I mean, please, I don't
wanna see the face.

723
00:38:52,847 --> 00:38:55,414
I don't want to hear what
you have to say. I was fine!

724
00:38:55,516 --> 00:38:58,117
I was on fire! I was learning!

725
00:38:58,219 --> 00:39:01,453
I felt alive for the first time in
I don't know how long, Owen.

726
00:39:01,555 --> 00:39:05,291
- Like I had air in my lungs.
- She's leaving Seattle.

727
00:39:10,798 --> 00:39:13,118
It's just not gonna
work for her.

728
00:39:22,294 --> 00:39:24,854
When I lost my nerve
the chief helped me.

729
00:39:29,684 --> 00:39:31,417
It's... nothing.

730
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:34,587
If it's nothing, find a
way to look me in the eye.

731
00:39:42,948 --> 00:39:45,448
- What are you doing in here?
- Moving in.

732
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:48,618
No, no, no. I'm sick of
living in a damn trailer.

733
00:39:48,703 --> 00:39:53,772
- Go live in Izzie's old room.
- You go, she's your wife.

734
00:39:56,678 --> 00:39:59,846
I thought you were shacking
up with what's-his-face.

735
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:02,548
I'm not.

736
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:04,583
The Post-it didn't say
anything about lying.

737
00:40:04,685 --> 00:40:08,204
- I didn't think it needed it.
- I'm not lying.

738
00:40:08,306 --> 00:40:11,407
You don't need to know
every thought in my head.

739
00:40:11,509 --> 00:40:13,153
I have relationships
that don't...

740
00:40:13,177 --> 00:40:14,626
What are you doing?

741
00:40:15,981 --> 00:40:18,681
I'm too young to
be a grandmother.

742
00:40:21,586 --> 00:40:24,587
I'm just supposed to
be working like a dog

743
00:40:24,689 --> 00:40:28,140
and then come home
and do stupid things

744
00:40:28,242 --> 00:40:30,877
like Bungee jumping.

745
00:40:30,979 --> 00:40:32,862
Or Jell-O shots.

746
00:40:32,964 --> 00:40:37,433
I don't even know what
people my own age do anymore.

747
00:40:41,455 --> 00:40:44,423
I know something
stupid you can do.

748
00:40:49,681 --> 00:40:50,980
Hmm...

749
00:41:00,275 --> 00:41:02,826
<i>You never forget the
moment you become a doctor.</i>

750
00:41:09,434 --> 00:41:12,869
I don't know why I...

751
00:41:12,971 --> 00:41:15,149
I keep telling myself
there's no problem.

752
00:41:15,173 --> 00:41:18,141
But if there's no problem,
why can't I just say it?

753
00:41:19,844 --> 00:41:21,611
<i>A switch flips.</i>

754
00:41:23,748 --> 00:41:26,599
<i>Suddenly, you're not
playing dress-up anymore.</i>

755
00:41:28,352 --> 00:41:29,952
<i>You own the white coat.</i>

756
00:41:35,643 --> 00:41:37,944
Dr. Altman, wait. Wait.

757
00:41:38,046 --> 00:41:39,678
What do you want? More money?

758
00:41:39,781 --> 00:41:41,380
- I'll talk to the chief.
- No.

759
00:41:41,482 --> 00:41:44,316
They can set up a new
cardio unit with a research lab

760
00:41:44,418 --> 00:41:47,086
- or you can work with vets.
- It isn't about that.

761
00:41:47,188 --> 00:41:50,072
Wait, wait, wait. No one's
ever believed in me like this.

762
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:52,942
You believe in me more
than I do. And I need that.

763
00:41:53,044 --> 00:41:54,627
I'm gonna die here without that.

764
00:41:54,729 --> 00:41:56,062
Cristina, it's complicated.

765
00:41:56,164 --> 00:41:58,848
- Tell me what you want...
- I want Owen!

766
00:41:58,950 --> 00:42:00,750
Take him!

767
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:04,064
<i>What you may not notice</i>

768
00:42:04,088 --> 00:42:06,055
<i>is the moment that
being a doctor...</i>

769
00:42:08,125 --> 00:42:10,542
<i>changes you.</i>

770
00:42:12,914 --> 00:42:15,714
He's drinking again.
