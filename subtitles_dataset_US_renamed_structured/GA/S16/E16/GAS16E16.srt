00:00:02,656 --> 00:00:04,212
A month ago,
you were in med school

2
00:00:04,271 --> 00:00:06,287
being taught
by doctors.

3
00:00:06,372 --> 00:00:10,201
Today
you are the doctors.

4
00:00:10,286 --> 00:00:12,717
The seven years you spend here
as a surgical resident

5
00:00:12,802 --> 00:00:14,943
will be the best
and worst of your life.

God, I hate nurses.

I'm Alex.
I'm with Jeremy.

64
00:03:31,724 --> 00:03:33,393
You're, uh... You're with
the Nazi, right?

65
00:03:33,478 --> 00:03:34,932
She may not have pneumonia,
you know?

66
00:03:35,017 --> 00:03:37,103
She could be splinting,
or have a P.E.

67
00:03:37,303 --> 00:03:39,889
Like I said,
I hate nurses.

68
00:03:40,196 --> 00:03:42,032
What did you just say?

69
00:03:42,876 --> 00:03:44,452
Did you just
call me a nurse?

70
00:03:44,595 --> 00:03:46,314
Well,
if the white cap fits.

71
00:03:46,414 --> 00:03:48,571
<i>What I do know is
I owe you the truth,</i>

72
00:03:49,267 --> 00:03:51,108
<i>and I don't know how else
to tell you.</i>

73
00:03:52,442 --> 00:03:55,781
<i>But you know as well as I do
if I showed up on your doorstep,</i>

74
00:03:55,866 --> 00:03:58,000
<i>you'd yell
or give me guilt or crap</i>

75
00:03:58,085 --> 00:04:00,710
<i>or whatever you do that
seems to always set me straight.</i>

76
00:04:00,795 --> 00:04:01,999
We're grown-ups.

77
00:04:02,248 --> 00:04:03,261
We can't run.

78
00:04:03,346 --> 00:04:05,460
We have to face up to
the stupid things we do.

79
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:07,233
- Alex!
- Get off!

80
00:04:07,506 --> 00:04:09,265
Supposedly, if you
face up to them,

81
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:11,500
something good comes out of it.
I don't know what.

82
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:13,914
You were always the one
to set me straight...

83
00:04:13,999 --> 00:04:16,096
God, I smell good!

84
00:04:17,678 --> 00:04:19,312
You know what it is?

85
00:04:19,795 --> 00:04:22,602
It's the smell
of open-heart surgery.

86
00:04:23,928 --> 00:04:26,506
It's awesome.
It is awesome.

87
00:04:26,843 --> 00:04:30,063
- You gotta smell me.
- I don't want to smell you.

88
00:04:30,148 --> 00:04:31,752
- ...to point out when I was
being an ass. - Oh, yes, you do.

89
00:04:31,836 --> 00:04:33,996
You have got
to be kidding me!

90
00:04:34,578 --> 00:04:37,868
Okay, I have more important
things to deal with than you.

91
00:04:38,024 --> 00:04:41,533
I have roommates and boy
problems and family problems.

92
00:04:41,618 --> 00:04:44,423
You wanna act like a little
frat-boy bitch? That's fine.

93
00:04:44,508 --> 00:04:47,298
You wanna take credit for
your saves and everybody else's?

94
00:04:47,383 --> 00:04:50,150
That's fine, too.
Just stay outta my face.

95
00:04:50,235 --> 00:04:51,312
And for the record,

96
00:04:51,396 --> 00:04:53,822
you smell like crap!

97
00:04:53,907 --> 00:04:55,197
<i>And when that didn't work,</i>

98
00:04:55,282 --> 00:04:57,572
<i>you'd flop in my bed
and say the one perfect thing</i>

99
00:04:57,657 --> 00:04:59,431
<i>that would make sense.</i>

100
00:04:59,516 --> 00:05:03,111
<i>But the thing is,
I can't come back.</i>

101
00:05:06,946 --> 00:05:08,182
<i>I can't face you.</i>

102
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:10,079
You can go.

103
00:05:11,023 --> 00:05:12,400
What are you gonna do
if I leave?

104
00:05:12,485 --> 00:05:14,142
It's just us now.

105
00:05:14,227 --> 00:05:17,337
There were five of us,
and now it's just you and I.

106
00:05:17,422 --> 00:05:18,762
And it can't be just me.

107
00:05:18,846 --> 00:05:20,095
It seems like
five seconds ago,

108
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,312
we were the interns
hiding in the tunnels.

109
00:05:21,396 --> 00:05:23,052
- Alex!
- Get off.

110
00:05:23,136 --> 00:05:24,548
Look, I'm not gonna stay
in Seattle

111
00:05:24,633 --> 00:05:26,010
just because you don't want
to be alone.

112
00:05:26,094 --> 00:05:28,650
<i>I deserve the guilt
and to be called an ass,</i>

113
00:05:28,735 --> 00:05:30,945
<i>but I don't want to be
set straight.</i>

114
00:05:31,136 --> 00:05:33,352
<i>I don't want you
to say the right thing</i>

115
00:05:33,782 --> 00:05:36,523
<i>because the one perfect thing
isn't in Seattle.</i>

116
00:05:36,952 --> 00:05:38,382
<i>Not anymore.</i>

117
00:05:38,766 --> 00:05:40,915
Yang left me
her shares and her board seat

118
00:05:41,031 --> 00:05:43,679
and... she left me you,
too.

119
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:45,378
It's just us now.

120
00:05:46,039 --> 00:05:47,962
I don't know... if you need
somebody to bitch to

121
00:05:48,164 --> 00:05:49,836
or just be...

122
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:52,472
My person.

123
00:05:53,172 --> 00:05:54,428
I don't know
what you mean.

124
00:05:54,796 --> 00:05:56,118
But you do.

125
00:05:56,203 --> 00:05:57,861
Apparently,
I'm your emergency contact.

126
00:05:57,945 --> 00:05:59,860
I want waffle Sundays.

127
00:05:59,952 --> 00:06:01,749
Like a family,
all of us...

128
00:06:01,835 --> 00:06:04,291
Everybody, all together.

129
00:06:04,376 --> 00:06:05,234
Okay.

130
00:06:05,342 --> 00:06:06,961
I want to do that
as long as we can.

131
00:06:07,756 --> 00:06:10,671
- It's important to me.
- God, get off! Stop it!

132
00:06:10,817 --> 00:06:14,483
Oh, my God.
Ohh.

133
00:06:17,616 --> 00:06:21,062
<i>But I swear, it's not
about work or you or Jo.</i>

134
00:06:21,355 --> 00:06:23,231
<i>It's about me.</i>

135
00:06:23,417 --> 00:06:24,812
<i>I left.</i>

136
00:06:26,326 --> 00:06:27,914
And I'm with Izzie.

137
00:06:32,647 --> 00:06:35,250
<i>This is probably the part
where you're gonna get on your phone</i>

138
00:06:35,334 --> 00:06:36,671
<i>and call a million times</i>

139
00:06:36,818 --> 00:06:39,013
<i>and leave hateful messages
on my machine</i>

140
00:06:39,131 --> 00:06:40,967
<i>till I call you back.</i>

141
00:06:41,217 --> 00:06:42,787
<i>But I can't, Mer.</i>

142
00:06:43,122 --> 00:06:45,214
<i>I can't lie to you,
and I can't promise</i>

143
00:06:45,315 --> 00:06:48,101
<i>I'm gonna come home
because it's not home anymore.</i>

144
00:06:48,332 --> 00:06:50,248
- Go make her happy.
- Yeah.

145
00:06:59,721 --> 00:07:02,377
<i>When you were in danger
of losing your license,</i>

146
00:07:02,477 --> 00:07:04,013

00:07:04,098 --> 00:07:05,959
<i>and show up on your behalf,</i>

148
00:07:07,189 --> 00:07:08,568
<i>I called Izzie, too.</i>

149
00:07:10,394 --> 00:07:12,370
<i>I want to say
I hoped she wouldn't answer,</i>

150
00:07:12,471 --> 00:07:15,599
<i>but the truth is
I hoped she would.</i>

151
00:07:16,021 --> 00:07:18,701
<i>I want to say,
"I had to call her for you,"</i>

152
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:20,786
<i>but that would be a lie.</i>

153
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:23,052
<i>The truth is
your trial gave me</i>

154
00:07:23,137 --> 00:07:25,183
<i>an excuse good enough
to call her.</i>

155
00:07:27,552 --> 00:07:30,107

00:08:06,602 --> 00:08:08,150
<i>Hand me those paddles.</i>

171
00:08:08,235 --> 00:08:10,639
- Clear.
- <i>I wanted to hear her voice.</i>

172
00:08:10,732 --> 00:08:14,198
I'm a bride.

173
00:08:14,283 --> 00:08:17,360
- Iz, come on. I'm getting her a real one.
- I love this one,

174
00:08:17,444 --> 00:08:19,150
and that makes it
a real one.

175
00:08:19,235 --> 00:08:21,571
<i>When she picked up,
I blurted out the whole thing</i>

176
00:08:21,656 --> 00:08:23,713
<i>about you picking up trash
off the street</i>

177
00:08:23,798 --> 00:08:26,038
<i>and needing a letter that proved
you're better than that.</i>

178
00:08:26,907 --> 00:08:28,271
<i>And she laughed and said,</i>

179
00:08:28,355 --> 00:08:29,691
<i>"Of course she'd be
trash-picking,</i>

180
00:08:29,783 --> 00:08:31,449
<i>trying to save the world."</i>

181
00:08:31,604 --> 00:08:34,520
Today, Izzie Stevens,
our life together begins.

182
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,814
<i>And I, for one,
can't wait.</i>

183
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:38,756
<i>And then these voices
were in the background</i>

184
00:08:38,841 --> 00:08:40,478
<i>and a girl was singing
this song about</i>

185
00:08:40,563 --> 00:08:43,979
<i>"greasy, grimy gopher guts"
that I learned in first grade</i>

186
00:08:44,143 --> 00:08:49,179
<i>and I started laughing and
I asked if she had kids and...</i>

187
00:08:49,264 --> 00:08:51,104
<i>Izzie got quiet.</i>

188
00:08:51,703 --> 00:08:53,454
<i>For so long, she was quiet,</i>

189
00:08:53,569 --> 00:08:56,525
<i>and finally, she said,
"Yeah, I have kids."</i>

190
00:08:58,439 --> 00:09:00,186
<i>- "Twins."
- ♪ I know that I am nothing new ♪</i>

191
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:04,228
<i>And it turns out
they're my kids, Mer.</i>

192
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:11,004
<i>- ♪ There's so much more than me and you ♪
- Izzie's and my kids.</i>

193
00:09:11,462 --> 00:09:13,196
<i>She had our kids.</i>

194
00:09:13,423 --> 00:09:20,799
<i>♪ But, brother,
how we must atone ♪</i>

195
00:09:20,891 --> 00:09:27,721
<i>♪ Before we turn to stone ♪</i>

196
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,056
I love Jo.

197
00:09:32,172 --> 00:09:34,672
<i>Deeply. Still.</i>

198
00:09:36,219 --> 00:09:37,970
<i>I think I always will.</i>

199
00:09:38,439 --> 00:09:41,071
<i>And if it was just about
two women I love,</i>

200
00:09:41,345 --> 00:09:43,089
<i>I'd choose my wife.</i>

201
00:09:43,181 --> 00:09:44,626
<i>You know I would.</i>

202
00:09:44,711 --> 00:09:46,618
- Hey.
<i>- But it's not just her.</i>

203
00:09:46,703 --> 00:09:47,962
<i>Izzie made our kids.</i>

204
00:09:48,047 --> 00:09:50,963
I snooched into a cup
for you today.

205
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:55,126
Um... thank you?

206
00:09:55,297 --> 00:09:57,009
<i>She was single
and wanted children</i>

207
00:09:57,094 --> 00:09:59,712
<i>and couldn't have 'em because
the cancer nuked her eggs.</i>

208
00:09:59,797 --> 00:10:02,118
<i>But she had our embryos.</i>

209
00:10:04,692 --> 00:10:05,868
<i>Back then
I was too freaked out</i>

210
00:10:05,952 --> 00:10:09,047
<i>to care about what she did with
them if we never used them.</i>

211
00:10:09,132 --> 00:10:10,679
You think a Dixie cup
full of my swimmers

212
00:10:10,763 --> 00:10:12,009
will make everything okay?

213
00:10:12,094 --> 00:10:15,015
It's crap. This is crap.

214
00:10:17,006 --> 00:10:19,712
You just can't go messing
with people's heads like that.

215
00:10:19,914 --> 00:10:21,610
Even if she freezes
the embryos,

216
00:10:21,695 --> 00:10:23,692
you think... you think
we'll get a chance to use them?

217
00:10:23,776 --> 00:10:25,273
You think
she'll still be here?

218
00:10:26,463 --> 00:10:28,164
You think she'll survive
all this?

219
00:10:28,249 --> 00:10:29,156
Do you think...

220
00:10:29,248 --> 00:10:30,756
She t-told me...

221
00:10:30,841 --> 00:10:33,101
She told me she was seeing
a ghost, okay?

222
00:10:33,186 --> 00:10:35,375
And I'm so used to all
the crazy chicks in my life

223
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:36,590
that I didn't even...

224
00:10:40,846 --> 00:10:42,222
I'm a doctor.

225
00:10:42,431 --> 00:10:44,093
A doctor!

226
00:10:46,268 --> 00:10:47,890
And I didn't even think
to...

227
00:10:50,801 --> 00:10:51,807
And now she's...

228
00:10:51,891 --> 00:10:53,492
This is...

229
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:55,523
This is wrong.

230
00:10:57,101 --> 00:10:59,053
This isn't
how it's supposed to happen.

231
00:10:59,138 --> 00:11:00,474
I know.

232
00:11:00,566 --> 00:11:02,942
- It's crap.
- I know.

233
00:11:03,367 --> 00:11:04,597
I hate this.

234
00:11:04,681 --> 00:11:05,681
I know.

235
00:11:05,769 --> 00:11:07,059
This isn't...

236
00:11:10,514 --> 00:11:13,480
This isn't how we...
How we were supp...

237
00:11:13,565 --> 00:11:15,007
This isn't how I wanted
to do this.

238
00:11:15,099 --> 00:11:17,515
This isn't how Izzie and I
were supposed to make a baby.

239
00:11:17,814 --> 00:11:19,730
<i>So I signed papers
saying she could do</i>

240
00:11:19,815 --> 00:11:21,601
<i>whatever she wanted
with them.</i>

241
00:11:21,686 --> 00:11:24,102
<i>And so she used them.</i>

242
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:26,273
<i>And she had twins.</i>

243
00:11:26,645 --> 00:11:28,968
<i>Eli and Alexis.</i>

244
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:35,656
<i>I should have told Jo
or told you, but I didn't.</i>

245
00:11:35,972 --> 00:11:38,664
<i>I got through the trial
and then I came here</i>

246
00:11:39,132 --> 00:11:40,637
<i>and I met the kids.</i>

247
00:11:40,801 --> 00:11:45,082
<i>Met my kids, Mer.</i>

248
00:11:45,285 --> 00:11:46,449
<i>They're five.</i>

249
00:11:46,534 --> 00:11:51,160
<i>And hilarious and stubborn
as hell, just like Izzie.</i>

250
00:11:52,933 --> 00:11:55,082
<i>Like this little team
that gangs up on me</i>

251
00:11:55,167 --> 00:11:57,333
<i>with stubbornness
and sticky hands.</i>

252
00:11:57,487 --> 00:11:59,910
<i>Hi, horsey!</i>

253
00:11:59,995 --> 00:12:02,111
<i>And the second I walked
in the door,</i>

254
00:12:02,482 --> 00:12:04,168
<i>they wanted to show me
their rooms</i>

255
00:12:04,253 --> 00:12:06,512
<i>and the look on their faces
when they were showing me</i>

256
00:12:06,597 --> 00:12:09,013
<i>all their toys and books
and...</i>

257
00:12:09,098 --> 00:12:12,496
<i>asked if they could
call me...</i>

258
00:12:12,718 --> 00:12:14,114
<i>Dad.</i>

259
00:12:15,188 --> 00:12:16,692
<i>They both want to be doctors,</i>

260
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:19,341
<i>and Izzie teaches them
to bake just like her.</i>

261
00:12:19,426 --> 00:12:21,449
<i>And they scribble
pictures of stethoscopes</i>

262
00:12:21,534 --> 00:12:23,449
<i>all over the walls in chalk.</i>

263
00:12:23,902 --> 00:12:25,645
<i>And Alexis...</i>

264
00:12:25,752 --> 00:12:26,996
<i>...oh,
she's got Izzie's eyes.</i>

265
00:12:27,081 --> 00:12:31,270
<i>And... Eli smiles crooked
just like I do.</i>

266
00:12:31,355 --> 00:12:34,846
<i>And now I live on a freaking
farm in Nowhere, Kansas.</i>

267
00:12:38,018 --> 00:12:39,216
<i>And the kids play
with the chickens</i>

268
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,386
<i>and Izzie goes to work
as a surgical oncologist.</i>

269
00:12:44,402 --> 00:12:46,738
<i>Oh, and she's amazing, Mer.</i>

270
00:12:46,971 --> 00:12:48,567
<i>The progress she's made.</i>

271
00:12:48,652 --> 00:12:49,973
<i>She's alive.</i>

272
00:12:50,058 --> 00:12:52,262
<i>And she's a miracle
and keeping other people alive.</i>

273
00:12:52,347 --> 00:12:54,563
<i>And I'm applying
to the hospital nearby.</i>

274
00:12:56,731 --> 00:12:59,262
<i>And I wanted to be mad at Izzie
for keeping them from me,</i>

275
00:12:59,347 --> 00:13:03,285
<i>but I can't because all I am
is grateful she made them.</i>

276
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:06,349
<i>Oh, they're so damn smart,
smarter than I was at their age.</i>

277
00:13:06,434 --> 00:13:08,144
<i>Hell, sometimes at my age.</i>

278
00:13:08,691 --> 00:13:10,370
<i>And they get to
have everything...</i>

279
00:13:10,692 --> 00:13:12,967
<i>A home where they feel safe
and loved,</i>

280
00:13:13,051 --> 00:13:14,418
<i>and they play "sleepover,"</i>

281
00:13:14,503 --> 00:13:16,709
<i>where they just keep
swapping beds non-stop,</i>

282
00:13:16,794 --> 00:13:19,090
<i>all night until
they land in ours at 4:00 a.m.</i>

283
00:13:20,426 --> 00:13:22,382
<i>And they wake up
with two parents,</i>

284
00:13:23,004 --> 00:13:25,217
<i>when I rarely
ever even had one.</i>

285
00:13:25,301 --> 00:13:26,465
<i>Oh, I love them, Mer,</i>

286
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:28,416
<i>with every inch of me
and every cell,</i>

287
00:13:28,501 --> 00:13:30,215
<i>and I get to be their dad.</i>

288
00:13:31,015 --> 00:13:33,957
<i>I'm the guy who lied
and said I only had one ball</i>

289
00:13:34,049 --> 00:13:35,713
<i>to get into Seattle Grace.</i>

290
00:13:35,798 --> 00:13:37,283
<i>And it worked.</i>

291
00:13:37,368 --> 00:13:40,382
<i>I got a job and a career I love
based on a lie</i>

292
00:13:40,467 --> 00:13:43,507
<i>that no one really cared about,
and I made it work.</i>

293
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,878
<i>And when I look at my kids</i>

294
00:13:46,963 --> 00:13:49,709
<i>and doubt if I know
how to do right by them,</i>

295
00:13:49,941 --> 00:13:54,067
<i>I just think of you and Zola
and Bailey and Ellis.</i>

296
00:13:54,573 --> 00:13:56,847
<i>You're so brave. And you've
grown into this incredible mother,</i>

297
00:13:56,931 --> 00:13:58,927
<i>this incredible surgeon.</i>

298
00:14:00,051 --> 00:14:01,104
<i>You did that.</i>

299
00:14:02,713 --> 00:14:05,129
<i>You always said Cristina
was your person.</i>

300
00:14:05,214 --> 00:14:07,130
<i>Then I was your person.</i>

301
00:14:07,215 --> 00:14:10,315
<i>But you've always been
your own damn person,</i>

302
00:14:10,518 --> 00:14:12,987
<i>a force of freaking nature.</i>

303
00:14:13,222 --> 00:14:16,245
<i>You've never needed
anyone but you.</i>

304
00:14:16,861 --> 00:14:18,180
<i>And you can come here,
you know?</i>

305
00:14:18,265 --> 00:14:20,261
<i>You... You...
You could show up at my door</i>

306
00:14:20,346 --> 00:14:22,112
<i>and... and get me
to walk away from all this</i>

307
00:14:22,197 --> 00:14:24,501
<i>and just go back to you
and Jo and the hospital</i>

308
00:14:24,586 --> 00:14:27,066
<i>- and everyone who helped me get here.
-  ...two... one!</i>

309
00:14:27,151 --> 00:14:29,317
<i>
But I hope you don't.</i>

310
00:14:29,448 --> 00:14:30,932
<i>Mer,
you are my best friend,</i>

311
00:14:31,017 --> 00:14:32,513
<i>and I will miss the hell
out of you,</i>

312
00:14:32,598 --> 00:14:38,182
<i>but I'm finally
exactly where I should be.</i>

313
00:14:38,579 --> 00:14:40,831
<i>I never had that before.</i>

314
00:14:41,665 --> 00:14:45,281
<i>So, I hope you do come here
one day,</i>

315
00:14:45,784 --> 00:14:47,823
<i>but not to ask me to leave.</i>

316
00:14:48,283 --> 00:14:50,456
<i>I hope you come
to meet my kids</i>

317
00:14:50,605 --> 00:14:52,861
<i>and they get to call you
"Auntie Mer."</i>

318
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:56,878
<i>Because you'll love them,
and they'll love you.</i>

319
00:14:57,072 --> 00:14:58,854
<i>And until you're ready
to do that,</i>

320
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:02,262
<i>try not to hate me too much.</i>

321
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:03,800
<i>Please?</i>

322
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:08,346
<i>Alex.</i>

323
00:15:20,392 --> 00:15:22,018
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

324
00:15:24,525 --> 00:15:26,165
<i>You deserve
more than a letter.</i>

325
00:15:26,564 --> 00:15:27,886
I'm your intern
for the day.

326
00:15:27,971 --> 00:15:30,073
Oh. Well, hello, intern.
You have a name?

327
00:15:30,158 --> 00:15:31,221
Jo Wilson.

328
00:15:31,306 --> 00:15:33,821
Oh, nice. I like chicks
with boys names.

329
00:15:34,298 --> 00:15:35,766
<i>And this right here,</i>

330
00:15:35,907 --> 00:15:39,269
<i>this cowardice, this letter?</i>

331
00:15:40,126 --> 00:15:41,809
<i>It's officially
the worst thing I've ever done.</i>

332
00:15:44,688 --> 00:15:46,135
<i>But it's about me, Jo.</i>

333
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:47,134
<i>It's not about you.</i>

334
00:15:47,219 --> 00:15:50,438
- I don't live in my car anymore, jerk.
<i>- It's not what you deserve.</i>

335
00:15:50,523 --> 00:15:53,752
<i>You deserve and have earned so
much better than this. I got you a couch.</i>

336
00:15:53,837 --> 00:15:55,565
Hey,
powdered sugar's your favorite.

337
00:15:55,649 --> 00:15:57,314
Yeah, no.
Uh, this is great.

338
00:15:57,399 --> 00:15:58,649
You wanted to hear me
say the words.

339
00:15:58,733 --> 00:16:02,110
So I'm...
saying them right now.

340
00:16:04,436 --> 00:16:06,242
<i>I love you, Jo.</i>

341
00:16:06,687 --> 00:16:08,714
<i>- I love that you
are brilliant and brave,</i>

342
00:16:08,798 --> 00:16:10,345
<i>and no matter
what you go through...</i>

343
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:11,525
Hey, Brooke.

344
00:16:11,611 --> 00:16:13,142
Oh, wait. It's...
It's "Jo" now, right?

345
00:16:14,992 --> 00:16:16,907
<i>...you never
let it hold you back.</i>

346
00:16:16,992 --> 00:16:20,126
<i>Do I look like him?
You have my father's eyes...</i>

347
00:16:20,211 --> 00:16:21,462
<i>You have an out.</i>

348
00:16:24,695 --> 00:16:26,688
<i>It makes you stronger,
kinder.</i>

349
00:16:27,036 --> 00:16:28,532
<i>You made me kinder.</i>

350
00:16:28,617 --> 00:16:29,962
<i>That works?
The compliments thing?</i>

351
00:16:30,047 --> 00:16:31,203
Mm-hmm.

352
00:16:31,452 --> 00:16:32,868
God, you're sexy.

353
00:16:33,007 --> 00:16:34,321
Doesn't work on me.

354
00:16:34,406 --> 00:16:35,445
Ohh!

355
00:16:35,545 --> 00:16:38,454
Oh. A little warning
when people are over

356
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:39,368
would be nice.

357
00:16:39,453 --> 00:16:42,649
<i>You loved me for exactly
who I was, and I loved you.</i>

358
00:16:42,734 --> 00:16:43,979
I'm gonna marry
that girl.

359
00:16:44,542 --> 00:16:46,485
Ohh! Yes!

360
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:47,689
<i>I love you.</i>

361
00:16:47,985 --> 00:16:51,024
<i>Maybe it's not fair to say that,
but it's true.</i>

362
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:52,189
What's also true is...

363
00:16:54,849 --> 00:16:56,265
...I'm in love with Izzie.

364
00:17:02,826 --> 00:17:03,992
When I asked you

365
00:17:04,077 --> 00:17:05,508
if you wanted
to move in with me,

366
00:17:05,593 --> 00:17:06,984
you said that you did

367
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:08,384
and that you could
picture a life with me,

368
00:17:08,468 --> 00:17:10,992
but you never said anything
about babies.

369
00:17:11,077 --> 00:17:14,078
You said,
"Maybe we could get a dog."

370
00:17:14,163 --> 00:17:16,509
- Do you want a dog?
- No, I want to know what we're doing here.

371
00:17:16,593 --> 00:17:18,625
I love you,
and you love me.

372
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:20,367
I know,
but when I look ahead...

373
00:17:20,452 --> 00:17:21,414
Why are we
looking ahead?

374
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:23,656
If you had or maybe
you do have, for all I know,

375
00:17:23,741 --> 00:17:26,079
a bunch of Izzie babies walking
around with your face on them...

376
00:17:26,163 --> 00:17:27,351
And why
are we doing it now?

377
00:17:27,436 --> 00:17:29,859
And... And I'm just
the "Let's get a dog" girl?

378
00:17:29,944 --> 00:17:31,968
You always ask about Izzie,
what she was like.

379
00:17:32,053 --> 00:17:33,407
Well, that...
That girl right there.

380
00:17:33,491 --> 00:17:35,054
<i>That... That's what Izzie
was like.</i>

381
00:17:35,139 --> 00:17:38,101
<i>I imagined this whole life
for her where she was baking</i>

382
00:17:38,186 --> 00:17:40,148
<i>and happy
and had a bunch of kids.</i>

383
00:17:40,233 --> 00:17:42,101
Alex, if you want
to know how she is,

384
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:43,297
you should just call her.

385
00:17:43,382 --> 00:17:45,172
<i>And I never imagined me
in that picture.</i>

386
00:17:45,257 --> 00:17:46,460
You should call Izzie.

387
00:17:46,545 --> 00:17:48,037
<i>But suddenly, I am.</i>

388
00:17:48,615 --> 00:17:50,769
<i>Not suddenly.
That's a lie there.</i>

389
00:17:51,373 --> 00:17:53,241
<i>There was a part of me
that always wondered,</i>

390
00:17:53,326 --> 00:17:55,077
<i>always
wanted to know,</i>

391
00:17:55,162 --> 00:17:58,859
<i>always felt
like we left things unresolved,</i>

392
00:17:59,521 --> 00:18:01,217
<i>unfinished.</i>

393
00:18:01,817 --> 00:18:05,946
<i>So, when Mer needed all those
letters, I reached out to her.</i>

394
00:18:06,537 --> 00:18:08,601
<i>I reached out to Izzie
and we started talking</i>

395
00:18:08,686 --> 00:18:10,507
<i>and it scared the crap
out of me</i>

396
00:18:10,592 --> 00:18:13,439
<i>because it felt like
no time had passed,</i>

397
00:18:14,131 --> 00:18:17,015
<i>like Izzie and I were
kind of frozen together in time,</i>

398
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,744
<i>and now... now we're not.</i>

399
00:18:19,829 --> 00:18:20,835
<i>She's not.</i>

400
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,359
<i>She's here in Kansas,</i>

401
00:18:22,443 --> 00:18:25,359
<i>on a farm in this incredible
place in the middle of nowhere.</i>

402
00:18:25,443 --> 00:18:27,269
<i>And I never,
in a million years,</i>

403
00:18:27,353 --> 00:18:30,439
<i>would think I belong here,
but I do.</i>

404
00:18:31,383 --> 00:18:32,947
<i>And I can't lie to you...</i>

405
00:18:33,031 --> 00:18:34,939
<i>...and pretend the truth
isn't the truth...</i>

406
00:18:35,024 --> 00:18:37,461
<i>That I love you
and I love Izzie.</i>

407
00:18:38,273 --> 00:18:42,010
<i>But if it was just me missing
her or nostalgia or whatever...</i>

408
00:18:42,095 --> 00:18:43,002
Will you stay with me?

409
00:18:43,087 --> 00:18:44,727
<i>...I would have been able to
walk away</i>

410
00:18:44,812 --> 00:18:46,062
<i>and come back to you.</i>

411
00:18:48,236 --> 00:18:50,359
<i>But Izzie had my kids.</i>

412
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:54,104
<i>And I know you get
what that really means.</i>

413
00:18:54,189 --> 00:18:55,690
<i>I know you of all people</i>

414
00:18:55,775 --> 00:18:58,345
<i>understand why
I can't just leave now...</i>

415
00:18:58,494 --> 00:19:01,809
<i>...why I can't miss
another second of my kids' lives.</i>

416
00:19:02,509 --> 00:19:04,689
<i>I have a chance
to make this family whole,</i>

417
00:19:05,189 --> 00:19:08,206
<i>and I just hope you love me back
enough to let me take it.</i>

418
00:19:09,572 --> 00:19:12,362
<i>I need to give these kids
the family you and I never had,</i>

419
00:19:12,447 --> 00:19:16,049
<i>with barbecuing out on
the back porch and soccer games</i>

420
00:19:16,134 --> 00:19:17,978
<i>and movie nights
and book reports.</i>

421
00:19:18,311 --> 00:19:19,804
- Mom.
- Mom.

422
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:28,390
<i>I didn't know
she would have my kids,</i>

423
00:19:28,475 --> 00:19:30,317
<i>and now that she does,</i>

424
00:19:30,766 --> 00:19:33,058
<i>I don't know how to look anyone
in the eye if I don't stay</i>

425
00:19:33,143 --> 00:19:36,359
<i>and do everything I can
to make this work...</i>

426
00:19:36,952 --> 00:19:40,280
<i>Make this a life,
make this a family.</i>

427
00:19:41,756 --> 00:19:42,913
<i>You were wrong.</i>

428
00:19:43,139 --> 00:19:45,479
<i>You're not
the "Let's get a dog" girl.</i>

429
00:19:45,686 --> 00:19:47,133
<i>And I was never holding
a candle</i>

430
00:19:47,218 --> 00:19:48,664
<i>or those pieces of paper</i>

431
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:51,741
<i>thinking anything
would ever change.</i>

432
00:19:52,217 --> 00:19:54,608
<i>When I asked you to marry me,
I meant it.</i>

433
00:19:56,554 --> 00:19:58,485
<i>And we'll be together
forever, right? You and me.</i>

434
00:19:58,569 --> 00:20:00,328
<i>And if we have kids,
we'll be great.</i>

435
00:20:00,413 --> 00:20:02,099
<i>I'll be a great dad,
and you'll be great,</i>

436
00:20:02,183 --> 00:20:03,765
<i>and it'll be just us.</i>

437
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:05,836
<i>We won't need anybody else,
okay?</i>

438
00:20:05,921 --> 00:20:09,109
<i>When I told you I love you,
I meant it.</i>

439
00:20:10,115 --> 00:20:12,149
<i>But Izzie has our kids, Jo.</i>

440
00:20:12,825 --> 00:20:14,304
<i>Our kids.</i>

441
00:20:14,514 --> 00:20:16,899
<i>And the way you and I grew up,
I...</i>

442
00:20:17,569 --> 00:20:19,883
<i>I-I came to meet them,
to start to know them.</i>

443
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:22,350
<i>I missed five years
of their lives.</i>

444
00:20:22,483 --> 00:20:23,769
<i>And not because I was a junkie
like my dad</i>

445
00:20:23,853 --> 00:20:26,399
<i>or off my meds like my mom.</i>

446
00:20:26,991 --> 00:20:30,019
<i>I didn't exist to them until
I walked through the front door.</i>

447
00:20:30,741 --> 00:20:34,269
<i>And once I did, I had this
family I never knew I had</i>

448
00:20:34,353 --> 00:20:37,142
<i>on this insane farm,
and I wish I'd...</i>

449
00:20:38,345 --> 00:20:41,514
<i>I wish getting everything
I always wanted</i>

450
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:43,928
<i>didn't have to hurt you
in the process.</i>

451
00:20:55,239 --> 00:20:56,859
<i>But I can't lie to you.</i>

452
00:20:57,481 --> 00:20:58,919
<i>And I can't come home.</i>

453
00:20:59,153 --> 00:21:00,786
Are you asking me
to a dance?

454
00:21:00,958 --> 00:21:04,754
No, I'm... I'm asking you
to come back home.

455
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:08,006
<i>I'm not coming home, Jo.</i>

456
00:21:08,091 --> 00:21:09,256
<i>I can't face you.</i>

457
00:21:09,341 --> 00:21:10,490
<i>I can't look you in the eye</i>

458
00:21:10,575 --> 00:21:12,928
<i>because I wouldn't be able to
walk away.</i>

459
00:21:13,013 --> 00:21:15,388
<i>Maybe "I love you"
is wrong to say,</i>

460
00:21:15,473 --> 00:21:19,474
<i>but... thank you
for making me better</i>

461
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:21,535
<i>and taking care of me
when I needed it,</i>

462
00:21:21,691 --> 00:21:25,332
<i>for taking care of yourself
when you needed it, too.</i>

463
00:21:25,832 --> 00:21:27,208
<i>I went to a lawyer.</i>

464
00:21:27,293 --> 00:21:29,177
<i>I signed divorce papers.</i>

465
00:21:29,262 --> 00:21:31,149
<i>I left everything to you.
It's yours.</i>

466
00:21:31,473 --> 00:21:34,649
<i>You worked for every cent
you ever owned and then some.</i>

467
00:21:35,176 --> 00:21:37,731
<i>I also left you my shares
in Grey-Sloan.</i>

468
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,254
<i>Whatever you choose to do with
them, I know it will be amazing.</i>

469
00:21:41,356 --> 00:21:42,450
<i>Just like you.</i>

470
00:21:44,226 --> 00:21:45,843
<i>You know, I, uh...</i>

471
00:21:46,113 --> 00:21:48,189
<i>I barely saw you
this week,</i>

472
00:21:48,856 --> 00:21:51,137
<i>and it sucked.</i>

473
00:21:52,348 --> 00:21:55,193
<i>I'll find another job.
Whatever.</i>

474
00:21:55,278 --> 00:21:58,149
<i>I, uh, but I don't want
to never see you again.</i>

475
00:21:58,233 --> 00:22:02,979
<i>Oh, you deserve everything good
in this life, Jo.</i>

476
00:22:03,415 --> 00:22:05,858
<i>I hope you find
so much better than me.</i>

477
00:22:06,395 --> 00:22:07,551
<i>Thank you.</i>

478
00:22:08,832 --> 00:22:10,494
<i>I'm... I'm sorry.</i>

479
00:22:11,207 --> 00:22:13,148
<i>I don't know how to end this.</i>

480
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:15,348
<i>I don't want to.</i>

481
00:22:17,707 --> 00:22:19,268
<i>Goodbye.</i>

482
00:22:26,755 --> 00:22:29,295
<i>I'm guessing
you're not surprised by this,</i>

483
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:31,881
<i>and definitely not happy
about it.</i>

484
00:22:32,856 --> 00:22:34,717
<i>They called me Evil Spawn
most of the time</i>

485
00:22:34,802 --> 00:22:36,084
growing up in your hospital.

486
00:22:36,169 --> 00:22:37,381
Nice panties, Yang.

487
00:22:38,675 --> 00:22:40,711
In your dreams,
Evil Spawn.

488
00:22:40,795 --> 00:22:42,211
It's probably
one of the better nicknames

489
00:22:42,295 --> 00:22:44,591
I had most of my life,
to be honest.

490
00:22:44,675 --> 00:22:46,631
I earned the name.

491
00:22:46,715 --> 00:22:48,817
I know it, you know it.

492
00:22:48,902 --> 00:22:53,791
Morning, people. Hell,
you probably know that better than anyone.

493
00:22:53,875 --> 00:22:56,381
Truth is, you didn't like me
very much in the beginning.

494
00:22:59,636 --> 00:23:01,593
I didn't really like you much,
either.

495
00:23:01,678 --> 00:23:03,398
Sloppy, sloppy, sloppy.

496
00:23:03,483 --> 00:23:06,210
Redo these and return them to me
before lunch, understood?

497
00:23:06,295 --> 00:23:08,203
- Understood.
- Karev, don't tempt me.

498
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:10,148
And, Karev, see the chief
by the end of the day.

499
00:23:10,232 --> 00:23:10,890
What for?

500
00:23:10,975 --> 00:23:12,832
Do I look psychic to you?
He's the chief.

501
00:23:12,917 --> 00:23:14,092
He asked, you go.

502
00:23:14,177 --> 00:23:15,741
Karev,
go stand in the hall.

503
00:23:15,873 --> 00:23:17,324
- Karev, cover the pit.
- Pit!

504
00:23:17,409 --> 00:23:19,310
<i>Hate being an intern.</i>

505
00:23:19,443 --> 00:23:23,061
<i>You were mean and impatient...
and knew everything,</i>

506
00:23:23,146 --> 00:23:25,077
<i>and you liked everyone else
but me,</i>

507
00:23:25,162 --> 00:23:26,427
<i>even when you pretended
you didn't.</i>

508
00:23:26,511 --> 00:23:28,128
Are you sure
they're balloons?

509
00:23:28,644 --> 00:23:31,136
You have reason to believe
they're not balloons?

510
00:23:31,221 --> 00:23:32,459
This one here's
got a face.

511
00:23:32,839 --> 00:23:34,120
They all do.

512
00:23:34,901 --> 00:23:36,155
I'll be damned.

513
00:23:36,417 --> 00:23:39,004
They're Judys.
Judys?

514
00:23:39,355 --> 00:23:44,074
He swallowed
the heads of ten Judy dolls.

515
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:46,893
<i>Or you were convinced
I had "it"...</i>

516
00:23:47,198 --> 00:23:51,042
<i>That something that would make
them great someday.</i>

517
00:23:51,143 --> 00:23:53,840
<i>Hell, you named your kid
after O'Malley.</i>

518
00:23:53,925 --> 00:23:56,050
<i>And Mer named her kid after you,
and you...</i>

519
00:23:57,611 --> 00:24:00,746
<i>...you just seemed like all
my other teachers before you</i>

520
00:24:00,831 --> 00:24:03,808
<i>who took one look at me,
decided I was garbage,</i>

521
00:24:03,893 --> 00:24:06,222
<i>and that was
all I'd ever be.</i>

522
00:24:06,635 --> 00:24:08,120
<i>But here's the thing.</i>

523
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:12,160
<i>Unlike everyone else,
you let me grow the hell up.</i>

524
00:24:12,245 --> 00:24:14,887
- He saved a baby's life.
- <i>You gave me crap when I deserved it.</i>

525
00:24:14,972 --> 00:24:17,472
<i>You pushed my buttons
and my limits when I needed it.</i>

526
00:24:17,557 --> 00:24:20,191
What the hell? You are not some
hotshot surgeon right now.

527
00:24:20,276 --> 00:24:22,307
<i>Yeah, it's a teaching hospital
and all that,</i>

528
00:24:22,548 --> 00:24:25,033
<i>but you did more than that,
and you know it.</i>

529
00:24:25,222 --> 00:24:27,807
Why is there a trailer
in my parking spot?

530
00:24:28,026 --> 00:24:30,433
Is one of these yours?
My bad.

531
00:24:30,533 --> 00:24:32,136
<i>And, sure,
it'd be pretty great</i>

532
00:24:32,221 --> 00:24:33,769
<i>if I just
stayed there forever</i>

533
00:24:33,877 --> 00:24:36,214
<i>and repaid you
for everything you did for me.</i>

534
00:24:37,415 --> 00:24:39,582
<i>But you and I both know
I can't.</i>

535
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:42,901
<i>Never could.</i>

536
00:24:43,244 --> 00:24:45,026
<i>You helped me
grow the hell up,</i>

537
00:24:45,111 --> 00:24:46,823
<i>and you took a bullet
out of my stomach.</i>

538
00:24:46,923 --> 00:24:48,142
<i>You paged me?</i>

539
00:24:48,401 --> 00:24:50,730
I did. I have a surgery.

540
00:24:50,815 --> 00:24:52,322
You're actually gonna let me
near a patient?

541
00:24:52,406 --> 00:24:53,689
You are the patient.

542
00:24:53,774 --> 00:24:55,332
Get in there and get
on that table. Oh...

543
00:24:56,635 --> 00:24:58,776
I don't need a reminder
of this thing.

544
00:24:58,861 --> 00:25:00,707
I'm gonna carry
that day around with me

545
00:25:00,792 --> 00:25:02,542
every day
for the rest of my life.

546
00:25:02,627 --> 00:25:04,548
I don't need a reminder
every time I look at you.

547
00:25:04,666 --> 00:25:07,816
And I'm tired
of bullying you,

548
00:25:07,901 --> 00:25:09,458
so I am asking you,

549
00:25:09,768 --> 00:25:13,533
please, get in there
and get your shirt off.

550
00:25:15,868 --> 00:25:17,620
<i>You protected Jo
from herself,</i>

551
00:25:17,705 --> 00:25:19,167
<i>and if I started
the whole list</i>

552
00:25:19,252 --> 00:25:21,064
<i>of everything
I learned from you,</i>

553
00:25:21,244 --> 00:25:22,448
<i>I would never stop writing.</i>

554
00:25:22,533 --> 00:25:24,549
<i>And right now my hand hurts.</i>

555
00:25:25,299 --> 00:25:27,049
<i>So just know this.</i>

556
00:25:27,292 --> 00:25:29,878
<i>It took me
a long time to say it,</i>

557
00:25:30,228 --> 00:25:32,595
<i>but I'm a good peds surgeon.</i>

558
00:25:33,885 --> 00:25:35,168
<i>I'm an okay guy.</i>

559
00:25:35,775 --> 00:25:37,298
<i>I'm still trying.</i>

560
00:25:37,916 --> 00:25:41,400
<i>But I'm a really
damn good surgeon.</i>

561
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,488
- We got movement!
- And I don't mind saying it now

562
00:25:43,572 --> 00:25:45,642
because I didn't
figure it out myself.

563
00:25:46,384 --> 00:25:49,297
<i>You kicked my ass
and asked more of me than anyone</i>

564
00:25:49,382 --> 00:25:51,420
<i>and hired other teachers
who kicked my ass</i>

565
00:25:51,505 --> 00:25:52,647
<i>and asked more of me.</i>

566
00:25:52,732 --> 00:25:54,798
Karev, I hear that
you're the future of peds.

567
00:25:54,882 --> 00:25:57,588
Excuse me? - Yeah, a little birdie
named Bailey whispered it in my ear.

568
00:25:57,672 --> 00:25:59,521
I want you to work with me today so I
can see if she's right.

569
00:25:59,605 --> 00:26:00,605
What did she say?

570
00:26:00,732 --> 00:26:02,343
That you're the best babysitter
in the hospital.

571
00:26:02,427 --> 00:26:03,708
Shut up.

572
00:26:03,792 --> 00:26:05,498
<i>And I know who I am.</i>

573
00:26:05,582 --> 00:26:09,053
<i>I'm not that guy with a million
Catherine Fox Awards on a shelf.</i>

574
00:26:09,138 --> 00:26:10,459
Goodbye, Mom.

575
00:26:10,544 --> 00:26:12,482
Bye.

576
00:26:13,021 --> 00:26:15,548
A junkie dad,
a crackpot mom,

577
00:26:15,632 --> 00:26:18,878
and somehow Karev
still became a doctor.

578
00:26:18,962 --> 00:26:21,779
I'm not easily impressed,
but I'm impressed.

579
00:26:21,864 --> 00:26:23,874
<i>I became the guy you
trusted to run the hospital</i>

580
00:26:23,958 --> 00:26:24,912
<i>and keep your secrets.</i>

581
00:26:24,997 --> 00:26:26,668
<i>And now...</i>
It's okay.

582
00:26:26,752 --> 00:26:29,498
<i>...and now I'm a surgeon,
a friend,</i>

583
00:26:29,583 --> 00:26:32,717
<i>a father of two incredible kids
with Izzie Stevens,</i>

584
00:26:32,802 --> 00:26:36,088
<i>which I'm sure is breaking
your brain.</i>

585
00:26:36,356 --> 00:26:38,207
<i>- But it's true.</i>
- Nothing!

586
00:26:38,529 --> 00:26:40,048
<i>I'm all these things.</i>

587
00:26:40,132 --> 00:26:41,548
She been out there
all day?

588
00:26:41,632 --> 00:26:43,838
<i>And by the way,
I have a shot</i>

589
00:26:43,922 --> 00:26:46,466
<i>at being Chief of Peds
at Shawnee County here,</i>

590
00:26:46,654 --> 00:26:49,201
<i>but I'm guessing
you're the last person</i>

591
00:26:49,286 --> 00:26:51,482
<i>I should put down as a rec
right now.</i>

592
00:26:53,042 --> 00:26:56,588
<i>Okay, look, the... the kids
keep asking for pizza sushi,</i>

593
00:26:56,672 --> 00:26:58,998
<i>and I have to go tell them
that's not a thing.</i>

594
00:26:59,082 --> 00:27:01,575
<i>And if I say any more
in this letter,</i>

595
00:27:02,042 --> 00:27:04,668
<i>there are going to be feelings
all over the place.</i>

596
00:27:05,044 --> 00:27:06,411
<i>Yours, not mine.</i>

597
00:27:07,008 --> 00:27:09,356
<i>And, really,
I'm just writing to say goodbye.</i>

598
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:11,878
<i>And thanks.</i>

599
00:27:12,283 --> 00:27:13,597
<i>And that sounds lame and small</i>

600
00:27:13,682 --> 00:27:14,895
<i>compared to everything
you've done,</i>

601
00:27:14,979 --> 00:27:17,971
<i>but there it is.</i>

602
00:27:19,526 --> 00:27:21,760
<i>Goodbye, and thanks.</i>

603
00:27:23,806 --> 00:27:25,647
<i>I love you, Dr. Bailey.</i>

604
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,119
<i>Dr. Alex Karev.</i>

605
00:27:38,644 --> 00:27:42,068
- Richard, alcoholic.
- Hi, Richard.

606
00:27:46,333 --> 00:27:47,725
See one,

607
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:49,770
do one,

608
00:27:50,333 --> 00:27:51,529
teach one.

609
00:27:52,825 --> 00:27:55,661
That's been the motto
of every hospital I run,

610
00:27:55,896 --> 00:27:58,680
every teacher I've loved.

611
00:27:59,091 --> 00:28:03,896
I loved being a surgeon,
saving lives,

612
00:28:04,333 --> 00:28:07,910
giving people back
their families,

613
00:28:08,912 --> 00:28:11,944
their loved ones,
and their friends.

614
00:28:12,044 --> 00:28:16,458
Giving them back to them
when all seemed lost.

615
00:28:17,354 --> 00:28:20,295
And I loved my students,
not because of ego...

616
00:28:23,515 --> 00:28:25,350
I'm done.
I'm done! I'm done!

617
00:28:25,434 --> 00:28:29,890
<i>...but because it gave me that
same rush, that same feeling...</i>

618
00:28:29,974 --> 00:28:33,350
That's why I'm the chief.

619
00:28:34,084 --> 00:28:37,250
<i>It's like you're helping
to keep people alive,</i>

620
00:28:37,335 --> 00:28:39,429
keep families alive.

621
00:28:40,903 --> 00:28:43,724
And then this morning,
I wake up to a letter

622
00:28:43,841 --> 00:28:46,850
from a student of mine,
who, well,

623
00:28:46,934 --> 00:28:50,930
let's just say he's not the one
I would have put money down on.

624
00:28:51,014 --> 00:28:53,230
What happens, uh,
if I... if I take the exam

625
00:28:53,314 --> 00:28:55,520
for a second time
and I don't pass?

626
00:28:55,604 --> 00:28:58,420
You will no longer be a surgical
resident at Seattle Grace.

627
00:28:58,505 --> 00:28:59,880
Failing again
is not an option.

628
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:01,970
- What's the big deal?
- Well, the big deal is you're...

629
00:29:02,054 --> 00:29:05,943
You're sweaty and you
and you smell.

630
00:29:06,028 --> 00:29:07,850
And you're not going
into my OR.

631
00:29:07,934 --> 00:29:09,194
What the hell's the matter
with you today?

632
00:29:09,278 --> 00:29:10,850
This is a teaching hospital,
okay?

633
00:29:10,935 --> 00:29:12,568
You were the chief
for 20 years.

634
00:29:12,653 --> 00:29:14,680
You're supposed to be
teaching your residents.

635
00:29:14,841 --> 00:29:17,100
Oh, I think I taught you
something today.

636
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:20,230
You don't give up a
once-in-a-lifetime surgery,

637
00:29:20,314 --> 00:29:23,998
not for any reason,
not for anyone, not ever.

638
00:29:24,083 --> 00:29:26,020
But he... he did the work.

639
00:29:26,104 --> 00:29:29,180
Yeah.
He... He showed up.

640
00:29:29,264 --> 00:29:32,640
He... He stepped up.

641
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,430
Became an excellent student,

642
00:29:35,514 --> 00:29:38,430
a stellar surgeon.
10 blade.

643
00:29:38,514 --> 00:29:40,100
<i>You're an underdog,
aren't you, Karev?</i>

644
00:29:40,184 --> 00:29:41,640
It's not that you don't
have the skills.

645
00:29:41,724 --> 00:29:42,930
You have the skills.

646
00:29:43,014 --> 00:29:46,100
But you're scrappy.
You're a fighter.

647
00:29:46,419 --> 00:29:48,060
I like that.

648
00:29:48,255 --> 00:29:49,600
I always root
for the underdog.

649
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:52,208
A fine teacher.

650
00:29:53,121 --> 00:29:55,778
He was working
with the best of the best.

651
00:29:57,262 --> 00:30:00,769
But instead,

652
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:03,498
he chose to abandon it all

653
00:30:03,583 --> 00:30:06,935
for who he says
is the woman he loves.

654
00:30:07,895 --> 00:30:11,442
And for the two children
they now have.

655
00:30:12,786 --> 00:30:16,420
You know, I wanted to
look him straight in the eye

656
00:30:16,505 --> 00:30:19,725
and yell at him and...
And tell him

657
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:21,522
that he's made a mistake,

658
00:30:21,607 --> 00:30:23,950
that it feels like a mistake.

659
00:30:25,771 --> 00:30:27,680
I've been there before,
yeah.

660
00:30:27,942 --> 00:30:31,470
I've fallen in love with two
people at the same time,

661
00:30:31,555 --> 00:30:32,685
and...

662
00:30:35,232 --> 00:30:37,568
And I know all you can do
is go with what your...

663
00:30:37,653 --> 00:30:40,583
Your bones and your guts
and your heart tell you to.

664
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:43,600
I wanted to grab him
and shake him and tell him,

665
00:30:43,684 --> 00:30:46,013
"Don't give it all away.

666
00:30:46,224 --> 00:30:48,935
Not now.
Not for... for this."

667
00:30:51,177 --> 00:30:54,942
But I missed my chance to watch
my own child grow into an adult.

668
00:30:56,511 --> 00:31:00,427
And I would give anything to
have those years with Maggie.

669
00:31:00,745 --> 00:31:02,388
I'd do anything.

670
00:31:04,231 --> 00:31:05,966
I guess, um...

671
00:31:07,356 --> 00:31:09,107
I just wanted
to say goodbye.

672
00:31:10,661 --> 00:31:12,521
I just wanted
to say goodbye.

673
00:31:12,724 --> 00:31:14,247
Hey, Dr. Webber.

674
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:16,229
I-I didn't want to work here,
either.

675
00:31:16,314 --> 00:31:19,522
You know, at Grey-Sloan,
I inherited a-a legacy.

676
00:31:19,607 --> 00:31:21,326
Bailey's legacy,
your legacy.

677
00:31:21,411 --> 00:31:22,671
You know, I mean,
every choice I made,

678
00:31:22,755 --> 00:31:25,247
I heard your voice in my head...
"Don't settle. Do better."

679
00:31:25,394 --> 00:31:27,584
At Grey-Sloan,
failing was our last option.

680
00:31:27,669 --> 00:31:28,930
But here,
failure's the culture.

681
00:31:29,364 --> 00:31:30,470
But we can change that.

682
00:31:30,554 --> 00:31:32,140
Help me turn
this place around.

683
00:31:32,427 --> 00:31:34,140
Help me do the impossible.

684
00:31:34,224 --> 00:31:37,263
I wanted to say thank you
for helping me

685
00:31:37,354 --> 00:31:42,028
to be a better doctor,
better teacher.

686
00:31:42,855 --> 00:31:44,419
I mean, anything.

687
00:31:46,677 --> 00:31:47,350
But he up and left...

688
00:31:47,434 --> 00:31:49,470
Karev! Do better!

689
00:31:49,554 --> 00:31:53,890
...with only a note
and an apology, and that's it,

690
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:57,600
not considering that I might
want to say goodbye

691
00:31:57,771 --> 00:31:59,020
as a teacher...

692
00:31:59,104 --> 00:32:00,560
Watch your back,
Karev.

693
00:32:00,644 --> 00:32:02,680
I may decide to teach you
something tomorrow.

694
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:05,309
Time of...

695
00:32:05,394 --> 00:32:06,717
...as a colleague...

696
00:32:06,802 --> 00:32:08,230
Time of death... 15:42.

697
00:32:08,314 --> 00:32:10,631
...as a friend.

698
00:32:11,173 --> 00:32:12,576
See one.

699
00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:14,350
Do one.

700
00:32:14,646 --> 00:32:16,302
Teach one.

701
00:32:17,054 --> 00:32:21,881
I've
seen people leave.

702
00:32:22,332 --> 00:32:25,168
I've done the leaving.

703
00:32:25,716 --> 00:32:29,430
Richard! Richard!
Richard!

704
00:32:29,514 --> 00:32:31,319
I was gonna ask you
to be by my side

705
00:32:31,404 --> 00:32:32,256
for the rest of our lives.

706
00:32:32,341 --> 00:32:34,020
I'm not sorry
about a damn thing.

707
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:41,216
And lately, it seems like
all the people I love just...

708
00:32:42,264 --> 00:32:44,318
...they just disappear.

709
00:32:45,834 --> 00:32:48,140
And...

710
00:32:48,677 --> 00:32:50,310
I can't...

711
00:32:50,638 --> 00:32:54,279
find a way to make it stop.

712
00:33:03,216 --> 00:33:05,437
Alex, if you want to
know how she is,

713
00:33:05,522 --> 00:33:07,513
you should just call her.

714
00:33:07,597 --> 00:33:08,646
You should call Izzie.

715
00:33:08,731 --> 00:33:09,694
No.

716
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:11,263
No, it's okay.

717
00:33:11,419 --> 00:33:12,577
No.

718
00:33:12,779 --> 00:33:15,553
I mean,
I-I-I don't need to call her.

719
00:33:15,975 --> 00:33:18,053
I know how she is.

720
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:20,223
I mean, she's, uh...

721
00:33:20,428 --> 00:33:22,923
She's married
with three kids,

722
00:33:23,007 --> 00:33:28,553
and she lives somewhere,
I think, uh, kind of woodsy?

723
00:33:30,467 --> 00:33:32,763
And she's a surgeon
and she goes to work every day,

724
00:33:32,847 --> 00:33:37,364
so she refuses to hire help,
so her house is always a mess.

725
00:33:38,276 --> 00:33:41,669
And it has Christmas decorations
all over it

726
00:33:41,754 --> 00:33:45,012
because she won't let
her husband take them down.

727
00:33:47,339 --> 00:33:48,552
It smells like muffins,

728
00:33:48,637 --> 00:33:50,864
and she's...

729
00:33:50,949 --> 00:33:52,359
She's smiling.

730
00:33:54,635 --> 00:33:57,671
When I picture her,
she's always smiling.

731
00:33:57,967 --> 00:34:01,598
I don't need to call her because
I want it to stay that way.

732
00:34:02,846 --> 00:34:07,176
I picture her
as happy as I am with you.

733
00:34:08,677 --> 00:34:10,423
You imagined
a whole life for her?

734
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:13,223
Oh, yeah.
It's way better than wondering.

735
00:34:16,347 --> 00:34:19,583

nobody likes you

Oh.

747
00:34:40,177 --> 00:34:41,223
I think

749
00:34:43,559 --> 00:34:45,963

one.

753

00:35:03,096 --> 00:35:04,342

no matter how hard
you push me away.

761
00:35:09,097 --> 00:35:10,696
Shut up
and get out of my room.

762
00:35:10,781 --> 00:35:11,963
No.

00:35:12,085 --> 00:35:14,512

00:35:36,147 --> 00:35:37,633

Miranda, is...?

798
00:36:55,347 --> 00:36:57,923
Alex Karev
isn't coming back.

799
00:36:58,271 --> 00:37:00,030
Left his wife,

800
00:37:01,061 --> 00:37:03,123
his friends, his job.

801
00:37:04,130 --> 00:37:10,179
Alex Karev is now a father
of two with Izzie Stevens.

802
00:37:12,998 --> 00:37:16,592
And, if they take my
recommendation seriously,

803
00:37:16,677 --> 00:37:20,921
he'll soon be Chief of Peds
at Shawnee Memorial.

804
00:37:24,097 --> 00:37:25,804
What's this got to do
with Joey?

805
00:37:27,677 --> 00:37:30,578
Now,
it is a matter of luck,

806
00:37:30,663 --> 00:37:35,303
of grace that Alex Karev
is who he is today.

807
00:37:35,851 --> 00:37:41,000
He could have just as easily
been lost to this world,

808
00:37:41,085 --> 00:37:42,723
aimless.

809
00:37:42,807 --> 00:37:46,343
But he survived his home,

810
00:37:46,741 --> 00:37:49,593
his family,
his foster homes

811
00:37:49,677 --> 00:37:51,593
and became a man,

812
00:37:52,093 --> 00:37:54,593
now a father,

813
00:37:55,452 --> 00:37:58,288
a fine surgeon by luck,

814
00:37:59,061 --> 00:38:00,804
by chance.

815
00:38:02,795 --> 00:38:06,461
Joey's future shouldn't
be a matter of chance.

816
00:38:06,546 --> 00:38:11,061
A child's future
can't be a matter of luck.

817
00:38:14,632 --> 00:38:15,999
Okay.

818
00:38:17,366 --> 00:38:18,803
"Okay"?

819
00:38:19,022 --> 00:38:20,827
Just like that? "Okay"?

820
00:38:22,217 --> 00:38:25,241
I just wanted to
talk about it.

821
00:38:25,741 --> 00:38:27,781
I mean, you and I,
look, we... we both make

822
00:38:27,866 --> 00:38:31,303
these big, sweeping decisions
without each other.

823
00:38:31,483 --> 00:38:34,133
You... You had a heart attack
and didn't tell me.

824
00:38:34,499 --> 00:38:36,757
You... You had a miscarriage
and shut me out.

825
00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:38,765
You... You change
careers like sweaters.

826
00:38:39,331 --> 00:38:41,960
Yeah.

827
00:38:43,319 --> 00:38:46,280
And I am down
for all of it. I...

828
00:38:47,085 --> 00:38:51,305
All the change and the easy
and the hard that comes with it.

829
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:53,280
Of course Joey
should have you.

830
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:54,673
Should have us.

831
00:38:54,757 --> 00:38:57,210
He should have a family.

832
00:38:57,387 --> 00:38:58,819
But...

833
00:39:00,047 --> 00:39:07,038
that family needs to learn to
talk to each other first, okay?

834
00:39:10,476 --> 00:39:12,272
I'm sorry.

835
00:39:12,637 --> 00:39:13,708
I know.

836
00:39:13,793 --> 00:39:15,293
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

837
00:39:19,046 --> 00:39:21,632
Congratulations,
Miranda.

838
00:39:21,717 --> 00:39:22,969
