Uh, hey. Has-Has Richard been
getting the hiccups lately?

36
00:01:55,304 --> 00:01:56,490
I don't know.
Why?

37
00:01:56,575 --> 00:01:59,077
Could be a symptom
of Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease.

38
00:01:59,162 --> 00:02:00,918
Less than 350 Americans
get it each year.

39
00:02:01,003 --> 00:02:03,217
There's no 1-hertz spikes
on the EEG.

40
00:02:03,303 --> 00:02:04,769
The RT Quick Panel
come back yet?

41
00:02:04,853 --> 00:02:06,389
Um... ugh.

42
00:02:06,473 --> 00:02:08,241
Not sure.
My tablet just died.

43
00:02:08,444 --> 00:02:09,752
Okay.
I'm gonna get another one.

44
00:02:09,845 --> 00:02:11,093
I'll be right back.

45
00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:16,247
Permission slip.

46
00:02:16,342 --> 00:02:17,881
Zola's field trip
to the zoo.

47
00:02:17,966 --> 00:02:19,928
Oh.
Well, that's next week, but...

48
00:02:20,013 --> 00:02:21,309
This is next week.

49
00:02:21,393 --> 00:02:22,663
Oh.

50
00:02:23,668 --> 00:02:25,272
Has DeLuca been sleeping?

51
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,725
I don't know.

52
00:02:27,327 --> 00:02:28,725
You're okay with that?

53
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:30,678
Are you here to help?

54
00:02:31,893 --> 00:02:33,475
When my mom was sick,

55
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:36,155
I was so blinded
by my need to cure her

56
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,530
that I couldn't accept the fact
that she was dying.

57
00:02:38,991 --> 00:02:40,328
And instead
of caring for her,

58
00:02:40,413 --> 00:02:43,014
I put her through
all this unnecessary testing,

59
00:02:43,755 --> 00:02:44,905
and I hurt her.

60
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,319
That's what you told me.

61
00:02:46,606 --> 00:02:49,129
Right, but she had
an actual diagnosis.

62
00:02:50,717 --> 00:02:51,973
It's Alzheimer's,
Meredith.

63
00:02:52,058 --> 00:02:53,634
I do not believe
that it is.

64
00:02:53,719 --> 00:02:55,871
Well,
Amelia and Koracick do.

65
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:58,246
So Catherine's
taking Richard home today.

Nope.
Unh-unh.

71
00:03:21,645 --> 00:03:23,074
You call me Baby Daddy.

72
00:03:23,341 --> 00:03:26,074
And now I will never
do that again.

73
00:03:26,363 --> 00:03:28,529
Did you already finish up
your arthroscopy?

74
00:03:28,614 --> 00:03:29,820
Yeah.
Cruised through it.

75
00:03:29,966 --> 00:03:32,606
Still have clinic
and some post-ops, but...

76
00:03:32,893 --> 00:03:34,849
how 'bout
an early movie?

77
00:03:34,933 --> 00:03:36,168
Then Angelini's.

78
00:03:36,253 --> 00:03:38,162
Take advantage of still being
a party of two.

79
00:03:38,247 --> 00:03:40,738
I have a DBS, and I'm hoping
to fit in a corpectomy.

80
00:03:40,863 --> 00:03:43,597
You had contractions last week
over an open brain.

81
00:03:43,691 --> 00:03:44,675
So?

82
00:03:44,772 --> 00:03:47,442
So, don't you think it's time
to lighten the load?

83
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:48,703
I am.

84
00:03:48,788 --> 00:03:50,505
Well, you can return
to surgery

85
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:52,194
whenever you want
after this baby is born.

86
00:03:52,278 --> 00:03:53,918
My body won't
come back so fast,

87
00:03:54,003 --> 00:03:56,129
so I gotta squeeze in
as much as I can.

88
00:03:56,303 --> 00:03:58,262
Dr. Shepherd,
O.R. 3 is ready.

89
00:03:58,481 --> 00:04:00,778
Alright.
I will be there in a minute.

90
00:04:03,449 --> 00:04:05,293
Might be more like ten.

91
00:04:05,597 --> 00:04:06,699
Shut up!

92
00:04:09,197 --> 00:04:11,005
And let me know
if there's any increase

93
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:12,809
in Mr. Rojas'
chest tube output.

94
00:04:12,893 --> 00:04:14,278
You got it, Dr. Altman.

95
00:04:14,486 --> 00:04:17,137
And, um, congratulations,
about tonight.

96
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:19,317
Even though marriage
is an outdated concept,

97
00:04:19,402 --> 00:04:20,442
I still think it's neat.

98
00:04:20,527 --> 00:04:21,442
- <i>I've been busy.</i>
- Thanks.

99
00:04:21,527 --> 00:04:22,493
<i>But it's
a simple request, Tom.</i>

100
00:04:22,578 --> 00:04:23,825
- Y-You need to calm down.
- Calm down?

101
00:04:23,909 --> 00:04:25,099
What the hell is wrong with you?
I should've known.

102
00:04:25,183 --> 00:04:26,472
Known? Known what?

103
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:27,463
What's... What's wrong?

104
00:04:27,548 --> 00:04:29,634
He said he didn't see the e-mail
requesting time off.

105
00:04:29,719 --> 00:04:31,216
I saw the subject line.
It didn't seem urgent.

106
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,466
Y-You're getting married,
what, in a few months?

107
00:04:33,744 --> 00:04:35,143
It's tonight, Tom.

108
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,455
It's just a... It's a
last-minute thing, you know?

109
00:04:38,705 --> 00:04:40,639
Some family members
for a backyard party.

110
00:04:40,723 --> 00:04:43,139
"Last-minute thing."
Well, that sounds elegant, Hunt.

111
00:04:43,223 --> 00:04:44,979
Well, it's exactly
what Teddy wanted.

112
00:04:47,322 --> 00:04:49,448
So, the time off, please?

113
00:04:49,591 --> 00:04:50,877
Sure.
Whatever you need.

114
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:51,969
Thank you.

115
00:04:52,053 --> 00:04:53,683
- I'll see you.
- Yeah, okay.

116
00:04:56,323 --> 00:04:57,389
Thanks for the heads-up.

117
00:04:57,473 --> 00:04:58,389
- Tom, I...
- No, no, no.

118
00:04:58,473 --> 00:05:00,349
I'm I couldn't be happier
for you.

119
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:05,463
Morning, Daya.

120
00:05:05,548 --> 00:05:06,565
How you doing today?

121
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:07,675
I'd be better

122
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,698
if I had a smiling photo
for this dating app.

123
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:11,247
His, not mine.

124
00:05:11,332 --> 00:05:12,948
She signed me up
against my will.

125
00:05:13,033 --> 00:05:14,739
And you can see
how happy it makes me.

126
00:05:14,838 --> 00:05:16,769
Oh, right. You can't.
Fun!

127
00:05:16,853 --> 00:05:19,401
Daya Burman, 13,

128
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:21,732
presents
with Moebius syndrome,

129
00:05:21,817 --> 00:05:23,428
a rare neurological condition

130
00:05:23,513 --> 00:05:25,752
that inhibits
facial expression and

131
00:05:25,837 --> 00:05:28,253
And leaves me with
resting bitch face 24-7.

132
00:05:28,338 --> 00:05:30,134
Not true.
And language.

133
00:05:30,219 --> 00:05:32,168
You'd swear, too, if you could
only express your emotions

134
00:05:32,252 --> 00:05:33,307
through Bitmojis.

135
00:05:33,392 --> 00:05:35,098
Well, fortunately, we're gonna
change all that. Dr. Avery?

136
00:05:35,182 --> 00:05:37,080
Yes, we are,
because today,

137
00:05:37,165 --> 00:05:39,388
we are doing a bilateral
gracilis transfer,

138
00:05:39,473 --> 00:05:40,989
which means we're taking
the muscles and nerves

139
00:05:41,073 --> 00:05:42,429
from your legs...

140
00:05:42,513 --> 00:05:43,667
Mm-hmm.

141
00:05:43,751 --> 00:05:45,067
...implanting them
onto your face.

142
00:05:45,151 --> 00:05:46,219
- Sorry to interrupt...
- Mm-hmm.

143
00:05:46,303 --> 00:05:47,639
...but we know the surgery.

144
00:05:47,723 --> 00:05:49,877
We've bailed on it four times
in the last year.

145
00:05:49,962 --> 00:05:52,151
And by "we," I mean

146
00:05:53,463 --> 00:05:55,190
But I think
he's finally ready,

147
00:05:55,275 --> 00:05:57,297
and I want to get going
before he chickens out again.

148
00:05:57,381 --> 00:06:00,138
Last time, I barely got into
a gown when he changed his mind.

149
00:06:00,223 --> 00:06:02,299
Because you don't need
this surgery.

150
00:06:02,384 --> 00:06:03,930
You're beautiful
just the way you are.

151
00:06:04,022 --> 00:06:06,181
You've been scared of hospitals
since Mom died.

152
00:06:06,303 --> 00:06:08,099
But I start high school
next year,

153
00:06:08,183 --> 00:06:09,666
and I want to have friends.

154
00:06:09,751 --> 00:06:12,737
Friends I can laugh and cry with
and who understand me.

155
00:06:12,822 --> 00:06:14,427
Because right now,
no one understands me.

156
00:06:14,512 --> 00:06:15,718
I do,

157
00:06:15,803 --> 00:06:17,502
and I think
you're perfect.

158
00:06:19,013 --> 00:06:20,448
Now we're talking.

159
00:06:20,683 --> 00:06:21,929
Look out, single ladies.

160
00:06:22,013 --> 00:06:24,166
- Hey, just
- Promise not to chicken out again

161
00:06:24,251 --> 00:06:25,997
and I won't post it.

162
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,505
21-year-old male.
Took a baseball bat to the chest.

163
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:41,086
- Blunt trauma?
- Not exactly.

164
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:45,207
Oh, my God.

165
00:06:46,486 --> 00:06:48,282
You should see
the other guy.

166
00:06:48,367 --> 00:06:50,117
He's totally fine.

167
00:06:52,143 --> 00:06:53,429
Okay, you
Look, you don't understand.

168
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:54,973
Alright? You're making
a huge mistake.

169
00:06:55,057 --> 00:06:56,659
DeLuca, this doesn't
concern you.

170
00:06:56,744 --> 00:06:58,824
Yes, it does concern me, okay?
R-Richard's my friend.

171
00:06:58,908 --> 00:07:00,916
You've had weeks
and have found nothing.

172
00:07:01,001 --> 00:07:02,245
I'm taking
my husband home.

173
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:03,370
Even if it means
you're gonna kill him?

174
00:07:03,454 --> 00:07:04,472
'Cause that's what you're doing.
You know that, right?

175
00:07:04,556 --> 00:07:05,556
- You
- Andrew!

176
00:07:05,701 --> 00:07:06,932
Take a walk.

177
00:07:10,643 --> 00:07:13,041
I'm sorry, Catherine.
He's exhausted.

178
00:07:13,126 --> 00:07:14,776
We're all exhausted.

179
00:07:15,915 --> 00:07:17,636
This is hard enough
without the accusations.

180
00:07:17,721 --> 00:07:19,058
But But I told him
not to come up here.

181
00:07:19,142 --> 00:07:21,838
Yeah, 'cause he's so great
at following the rules.

182
00:07:22,572 --> 00:07:23,979
Okay, I-I'm not a child!

183
00:07:24,064 --> 00:07:26,448
I-It won't take long.
Just to the exit.

184
00:07:26,533 --> 00:07:28,581
I'm taking you home,
sweetheart, remember?

185
00:07:28,665 --> 00:07:29,816
Look, I want to walk.

186
00:07:29,901 --> 00:07:31,473
Okay. Okay.

187
00:07:35,154 --> 00:07:36,360
- Ooh! Man.
- Ooh.

188
00:07:36,445 --> 00:07:38,292
- Damn it!
- Alright, you just slipped.

189
00:07:38,376 --> 00:07:41,122
My leg fell asleep because
you people keep me in this bed.

190
00:07:41,207 --> 00:07:42,163
Are you okay?

191
00:07:42,248 --> 00:07:44,414
I just need a minute, okay...
Okay.

192
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:46,979
'Til I can get the feeling
back in my toes.

193
00:07:48,356 --> 00:07:50,518
What do you mean you have
no feeling in your toes?

194
00:07:50,674 --> 00:07:52,380
Your feet have never
fallen asleep?

195
00:07:52,776 --> 00:07:53,973
Humor me.

196
00:07:55,121 --> 00:07:58,327
They're They're numb
and tingly.

197
00:07:58,588 --> 00:08:00,002
Meredith, he just slipped.

198
00:08:00,087 --> 00:08:02,471
Well, what about your fingers?
Are your fingers numb?

199
00:08:04,596 --> 00:08:05,753
Mm.

200
00:08:06,198 --> 00:08:07,969
I'm gonna check your calf,
okay?

201
00:08:10,303 --> 00:08:11,612
Mm!

202
00:08:12,015 --> 00:08:14,565
- Ohh!
- Okay.

203
00:08:14,658 --> 00:08:17,404
Tingling in the extremities
and sensitivity to touch

204
00:08:17,489 --> 00:08:19,865
are not signs
of Alzheimer's.

205
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:22,182
Definitely should do an EMG
to test his nerves.

206
00:08:22,267 --> 00:08:23,613
You really think
that's warranted, Grey?

207
00:08:23,697 --> 00:08:26,276
I do, because if I'm right,
then it gives us some hope.

208
00:08:26,361 --> 00:08:27,785
And if you're wrong,
then it's torture.

209
00:08:27,869 --> 00:08:29,682
I don't need
any more tests!

210
00:08:35,393 --> 00:08:36,705
Catherine...

211
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:39,643
I know you don't want to
see him in pain.

212
00:08:39,771 --> 00:08:41,937
I don't want to
see him in pain.

213
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:44,291
But are we really
willing to ignore this?

214
00:08:50,631 --> 00:08:51,776
Do it.

215
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:55,386
Ugh.

216
00:08:55,471 --> 00:08:59,104
Baby, we have to.
We have to.

217
00:09:02,838 --> 00:09:04,087
Let's type and screen him.

218
00:09:04,172 --> 00:09:06,479
Let's get a chest X-ray
and a CT trauma series.

219
00:09:06,564 --> 00:09:07,681
Schmitt,
let's get the ultrasound

220
00:09:07,765 --> 00:09:09,167
so we can assess
the extent of this damage.

221
00:09:09,251 --> 00:09:10,757
Catcher called for heat.

222
00:09:10,842 --> 00:09:12,164
Next thing I know Boom.

223
00:09:12,249 --> 00:09:13,675
Shards came at me
like a boomerang.

224
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,854
Let's page cardio.

225
00:09:14,939 --> 00:09:16,596
- It's in my heart?
- We don't know.

226
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:17,852
That's why
we paged cardio, alright?

227
00:09:17,936 --> 00:09:19,442
- I-I can take that for you.
- Yeah.

228
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:22,636
Cascades, huh?

229
00:09:22,721 --> 00:09:23,776
Yeah.

230
00:09:23,861 --> 00:09:25,283
My dream's to go
to the Mariners.

231
00:09:25,375 --> 00:09:27,346
Seems to be everybody's
dream these days.

232
00:09:28,353 --> 00:09:30,041
Okay,
ultrasound's unclear.

233
00:09:30,126 --> 00:09:32,120
We're gonna get you up to CT,
and let's book an O.R.

234
00:09:32,204 --> 00:09:33,808
- An O.R.?
- Trust me

235
00:09:33,893 --> 00:09:35,179
you do not
want to be awake

236
00:09:35,263 --> 00:09:36,885
when I pull this thing
out of you, okay?

237
00:09:36,971 --> 00:09:38,823
You're gonna be fine.
Okay, let's move.

238
00:09:38,908 --> 00:09:40,127
Let's go.

239
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:46,091
So, you noticed
sensory deficit

240
00:09:46,235 --> 00:09:49,771
and an increased sensitivity
to pain, which means...

241
00:09:49,902 --> 00:09:52,198
The nervous system
is like an electrical grid.

242
00:09:52,283 --> 00:09:54,859
By sending a small charge
to certain areas,

243
00:09:54,944 --> 00:09:56,900
we can see if all those lines
are connected.

244
00:09:56,985 --> 00:09:58,815
Or if a power line is down.

245
00:09:58,902 --> 00:10:00,318
The shock of this
should send

246
00:10:00,403 --> 00:10:02,416
all ten of his little piggies
squealing.

247
00:10:02,618 --> 00:10:05,268
From one chief to another,
sorry.

248
00:10:05,949 --> 00:10:07,823
Oh! Ohh.

249
00:10:07,908 --> 00:10:09,154
Ohh.

250
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:10,519
Adding more juice.

251
00:10:12,342 --> 00:10:13,712
- Aah!
- Yeah.

252
00:10:13,852 --> 00:10:15,837
Ohh!

253
00:10:16,236 --> 00:10:18,056
No motor output
going to the legs.

254
00:10:19,269 --> 00:10:21,587
The test confirmed
what we saw with the fall,

255
00:10:21,672 --> 00:10:23,748
which is he has
severe acute onset

256
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:25,919
motor and sensory
nerve degeneration,

257
00:10:26,019 --> 00:10:28,236
which is inconsistent
with an Alzheimer's diagnosis.

258
00:10:28,321 --> 00:10:30,098
I'd like to hear
from my neurosurgeons.

259
00:10:30,183 --> 00:10:31,915
Grey's right.
It's a fantastic catch.

260
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,900
I'm also withdrawing
my Alzheimer's vote.

261
00:10:33,986 --> 00:10:34,969
I

262
00:10:35,053 --> 00:10:36,277
It's not just his mind
that's failing him.

263
00:10:36,361 --> 00:10:38,423
- It's his body.
- Not Alzheimer's?

264
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:40,525
Oh, my God.
That... That's fantastic.

265
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:42,406
Well, what is it?
Where does that leave us?

266
00:10:42,491 --> 00:10:45,260
In neuroscience,
the official term is square one.

267
00:10:45,345 --> 00:10:46,400
We keep hunting.

268
00:10:46,485 --> 00:10:49,518
Right. Then we should start with
a sural nerve biopsy

269
00:10:49,603 --> 00:10:51,409
and re-check his pan-scan

270
00:10:51,494 --> 00:10:53,854
to rule out a
an occult tumor

271
00:10:53,939 --> 00:10:55,767
and just try to determine

272
00:10:55,852 --> 00:10:58,268
what exactly
is destroying his nerves.

273
00:10:58,353 --> 00:11:00,269
Agreed.

274
00:11:00,353 --> 00:11:02,673
Aw, damn it.
Trauma consult.

275
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:05,638
Please keep me posted.
And thank you, Meredith.

276
00:11:05,723 --> 00:11:06,939
Thank you all.

277
00:11:07,024 --> 00:11:09,414
Okay, I am, uh, clearing
the rest of my schedule today.

278
00:11:09,499 --> 00:11:11,125
I'll meet you
in the O.R., Grey.

279
00:11:11,217 --> 00:11:13,237
Uh, let Koracick
know what you find.

280
00:11:13,322 --> 00:11:14,603
I'm gonna let him
take over.

281
00:11:14,688 --> 00:11:16,175
Oh, you don't have to tell me
I'm better than you, Shepherd.

282
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:17,639
- I know I am.
- You're not.

283
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,337
But my water just broke.

284
00:11:20,853 --> 00:11:22,751
- Oh. - Oh.
- Oh.

285
00:11:22,908 --> 00:11:25,598
Uh... you want a wheelchair?
You're gonna walk?

286
00:11:25,683 --> 00:11:27,889
You do Richard.
I'm good to walk.

287
00:11:28,023 --> 00:11:29,353
Sorry about the floor.

288
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:30,923
I'm gonna call Link.

289
00:11:32,643 --> 00:11:34,053
- Oof.
- Good luck!

290
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:37,156
Are we there yet?

291
00:11:37,241 --> 00:11:38,321
To the line
you can't cross

292
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:39,814
unless you're a patient
or doctor?

293
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:41,603
Uh, no. Why?

294
00:11:41,688 --> 00:11:43,587
Wait! Doctors!

295
00:11:43,751 --> 00:11:44,885
That's why.

296
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:46,349
Just keep going.
He already gave consent.

297
00:11:46,433 --> 00:11:48,634
He's your dad, Daya.

298
00:11:48,934 --> 00:11:51,775
Uh, did you have
a last-minute question?

299
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:53,830
It's happening again.
Dad, breathe.

300
00:11:53,915 --> 00:11:56,143
Remember?
Please breathe.

301
00:11:56,228 --> 00:11:58,704
Daya, I'm sorry.
I love you.

302
00:11:58,853 --> 00:12:00,599
I can't lose you.
And you're perfect.

303
00:12:00,683 --> 00:12:02,219
You're perfect.
You don't need to change.

304
00:12:02,303 --> 00:12:04,599
I do.
I do need to change.

305
00:12:04,782 --> 00:12:07,017
Dad, I need this change.

306
00:12:07,522 --> 00:12:09,068
Mom wanted this for me.

307
00:12:09,223 --> 00:12:11,179
She wanted me
to be able to smile.

308
00:12:11,263 --> 00:12:13,389
She She wanted to be able
to make me smile.

309
00:12:13,517 --> 00:12:15,769
She wanted this,
and she's gone,

310
00:12:15,853 --> 00:12:17,429
and you're using her death
as a reason

311
00:12:17,513 --> 00:12:19,809
to not let me have what
she and I both wanted for me.

312
00:12:19,893 --> 00:12:21,219
That is just

313
00:12:21,303 --> 00:12:23,349
Okay, you have to breathe.

314
00:12:23,501 --> 00:12:25,679
Do you need
one of those bags?

315
00:12:25,764 --> 00:12:27,978
No, he's okay, right?
Nice and easy.

316
00:12:28,063 --> 00:12:29,018
Just breathe, okay?

317
00:12:30,221 --> 00:12:33,058
Look, Mr. Burman,
we know that her condition

318
00:12:33,143 --> 00:12:34,105
is not life-threatening,

319
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:36,190
but it is
a very serious challenge.

320
00:12:36,275 --> 00:12:39,152
We all depend on nonverbal
communication every day.

321
00:12:39,237 --> 00:12:40,429
You're doing it right now.

322
00:12:40,513 --> 00:12:42,808
You're not talking,
but we all can see that you are terrified

323
00:12:42,892 --> 00:12:44,219
and you're panicked,
all because

324
00:12:44,303 --> 00:12:45,679
you're scared
for your daughter.

325
00:12:45,763 --> 00:12:46,902
But we have good news.

326
00:12:46,987 --> 00:12:48,349
We know what she has,

327
00:12:48,433 --> 00:12:50,386
and we know exactly
how to fix it.

328
00:12:52,052 --> 00:12:53,932
We just need you to let us
do that for her.

329
00:12:54,715 --> 00:12:56,018
Let us do that for you.

330
00:12:56,432 --> 00:12:58,139
I want to smile, Dad.

331
00:12:58,393 --> 00:13:00,237
I want to be able to smile.

332
00:13:00,763 --> 00:13:02,219
Please.

333
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:05,075
Okay.

334
00:13:12,236 --> 00:13:14,008
Promise me you'll
swipe right at least once

335
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:15,086
while I'm in surgery.

336
00:13:16,553 --> 00:13:18,226
Alright.
Daya, you ready?

337
00:13:18,311 --> 00:13:19,132
Are you kidding?

338
00:13:19,217 --> 00:13:21,183
Look at this face.
I am pumped.

339
00:13:21,268 --> 00:13:22,764
Alright.

340
00:13:22,849 --> 00:13:24,249
We got her.

341
00:13:51,183 --> 00:13:53,559
I heard about Richard's EMG.
That's big news.

342
00:13:53,643 --> 00:13:54,880
Yep.
Talk of the hospital.

343
00:13:54,965 --> 00:13:57,551
- Well, that and your spontaneous wedding.
- Tom.

344
00:13:57,641 --> 00:13:59,332
Did my invitation
for tonight

345
00:13:59,417 --> 00:14:01,123
get lost in the mail,
or...?

346
00:14:01,223 --> 00:14:02,685
Let's not make this harder
than it already is.

347
00:14:02,769 --> 00:14:05,021
Oh, you're referring to
your impending nuptials

348
00:14:05,106 --> 00:14:05,998
as "hard."

349
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:07,639
- That's a good sign.
- I love Owen.

350
00:14:07,723 --> 00:14:08,809
And you love me.

351
00:14:08,893 --> 00:14:10,076
Now you're racing off
to the altar

352
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,899
to try to convince yourself
you can live without me.

353
00:14:11,983 --> 00:14:14,239
Spoiler alert.
You can't.

354
00:14:14,392 --> 00:14:16,935
This wedding is happening.

355
00:14:20,393 --> 00:14:22,123
You know, I've seen a few
shotgun weddings, Teddy,

356
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:24,713
but usually, it's not
the bride holding the gun.

357
00:14:36,033 --> 00:14:37,606
Everything is looking

358
00:14:37,706 --> 00:14:38,982
Oh. Oh, hey.

359
00:14:39,066 --> 00:14:40,096
What'd I miss?

360
00:14:40,181 --> 00:14:41,678
Just the initial
pelvic exam

361
00:14:41,763 --> 00:14:43,614
that shows that's Amelia's
at five centimeters.

362
00:14:43,699 --> 00:14:44,568
- Huh?
- Already?

363
00:14:44,653 --> 00:14:45,969
- Mm-hmm.
- "Huh"?

364
00:14:46,053 --> 00:14:47,139
You didn't feel
any contractions?

365
00:14:47,223 --> 00:14:48,364
Nope.

366
00:14:48,643 --> 00:14:50,130
Maybe a little.

367
00:14:50,628 --> 00:14:52,075
They started
at 9:00 this morning.

368
00:14:52,317 --> 00:14:53,349
What?

369
00:14:53,433 --> 00:14:55,512
You put yourself on the board
for five surgeries.

370
00:14:55,597 --> 00:14:57,179
Well, I thought they were
still Braxton Hicks.

371
00:14:57,263 --> 00:14:58,179
No, no, no, no.

372
00:14:58,263 --> 00:14:59,889
You're definitely
in active labor.

373
00:14:59,973 --> 00:15:01,509
- Ugh.
- I'm gonna go get the fetal monitor

374
00:15:01,593 --> 00:15:02,919
so we can
check on the baby.

375
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:05,429
What, are you skipping town?

376
00:15:05,513 --> 00:15:07,451
'Cause now is not
the right time to tell me.

377
00:15:07,536 --> 00:15:08,380
No, that's our go-bag.

378
00:15:08,465 --> 00:15:10,458
I packed Bluetooth speakers,
a deck of cards,

379
00:15:10,543 --> 00:15:12,089
trashy magazines,
peanuts.

380
00:15:12,183 --> 00:15:13,679
- I hate peanuts.
- No, those are for me.

381
00:15:13,763 --> 00:15:15,325
Oh.

382
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:18,308
Oh, I-I-I'll go get you
some French fries

383
00:15:18,393 --> 00:15:19,474
and and the biggest
chocolate bar

384
00:15:19,558 --> 00:15:21,395
- No. S-Stay. Please?
- I can find.

385
00:15:22,299 --> 00:15:24,544
I'm not going anywhere.

386
00:15:24,952 --> 00:15:27,248
Oh! Ooh!

387
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:28,749
Ah.

388
00:15:28,834 --> 00:15:29,960
Ah.

389
00:15:30,066 --> 00:15:32,778
It's not in your chest,
okay?

390
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:35,359
You don't feel pain
when you see something violent?

391
00:15:35,551 --> 00:15:36,927
Like, all over?

392
00:15:37,183 --> 00:15:38,403
No.

393
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:41,681
Hey. I'm here.
Sorry. I was with Richard.

394
00:15:41,766 --> 00:15:43,661
Oh. Um, how's he
How's he doing?

395
00:15:43,746 --> 00:15:45,862
We're making
some progress, I think.

396
00:15:46,093 --> 00:15:47,302
I hope.

397
00:15:47,387 --> 00:15:48,893
- Ouch.
- Yeah.

398
00:15:48,978 --> 00:15:50,458
See?

399
00:15:50,736 --> 00:15:53,812
Okay, baseball bat splintered,
went into his chest, obviously.

400
00:15:54,053 --> 00:15:55,469
Yeah, it did.

401
00:15:55,591 --> 00:15:57,356
He has blood
in the pericardial sac,

402
00:15:57,441 --> 00:16:00,779
and that looks dangerously close
to the left atrial appendage.

403
00:16:00,864 --> 00:16:02,997
Uh, you need to put him
on bypass to fix it?

404
00:16:03,082 --> 00:16:05,378
- Unlikely, but I will if it tears.
- Okay.

405
00:16:05,497 --> 00:16:06,769
He's a baseball player?

406
00:16:06,853 --> 00:16:08,177
Pitcher in the minors.

407
00:16:08,262 --> 00:16:10,138
- About to get called up to the majors.
- Yeah.

408
00:16:10,223 --> 00:16:11,654
- Not anytime soon.
- Yeah.

409
00:16:12,643 --> 00:16:14,509
Ohh. Gosh.

410
00:16:14,593 --> 00:16:17,389
Again, Schmitt, this is not
happening to you, okay?

411
00:16:17,473 --> 00:16:19,599
He worked his whole life
for this!

412
00:16:19,683 --> 00:16:22,966
Do you think her dad will
swipe right, like she asked?

413
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:24,567
Maybe.

414
00:16:25,213 --> 00:16:27,129
Is that my only
hope now?

415
00:16:27,252 --> 00:16:28,958
A stupid algorithm

416
00:16:29,043 --> 00:16:31,129
that claims to know
who to pair me with?

417
00:16:31,214 --> 00:16:32,671
I don't even know
what I'd put in my profile.

418
00:16:32,755 --> 00:16:34,081
I hate everything.

419
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:36,052
Well, except mac and cheese
from a box.

420
00:16:36,253 --> 00:16:38,568
- You know, this looks like 
the appropriate size.  - Mm-hmm.

421
00:16:38,652 --> 00:16:40,858
Now we just need
to tether the muscle

422
00:16:40,943 --> 00:16:43,981
to the oral commissures
right here and here.

423
00:16:44,066 --> 00:16:46,277
We'll be able to eliminate
that constant frown.

424
00:16:46,362 --> 00:16:47,807
What about you,
Jackson?

425
00:16:47,892 --> 00:16:49,388
Do you use
a dating app?

426
00:16:49,473 --> 00:16:50,889
Wait, what's your
profile picture?

427
00:16:50,973 --> 00:16:54,012
A shirtless selfie of you
on your yacht or on your jet?

428
00:16:54,152 --> 00:16:55,238
You have a jet?

429
00:16:55,323 --> 00:16:56,606
No.

430
00:16:56,691 --> 00:16:57,938
I mean, my family

431
00:16:58,022 --> 00:17:00,598
The Like, the foundation,
I guess, has a jet.

432
00:17:00,683 --> 00:17:01,864
What about you, Hayes?

433
00:17:01,949 --> 00:17:03,155
Definitely not a jet.

434
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,576
No dating profile,
either.

435
00:17:04,661 --> 00:17:07,473
Right, 'cause you have
your own personal matchmaker.

436
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:09,333
What's that
supposed to mean?

437
00:17:10,472 --> 00:17:11,856
Ready to close.
Vicryl.

438
00:17:26,352 --> 00:17:27,968
<i>Dr. Goldberg to L&D.</i>

439
00:17:28,053 --> 00:17:30,442
<i>Dr. Rachel Goldberg to L&D.</i>

440
00:17:32,611 --> 00:17:33,817
Any word?

441
00:17:34,135 --> 00:17:36,614
They're still in the O.R.

442
00:17:37,614 --> 00:17:40,780
You know, Tom, I'm
I'm a very proud woman,

443
00:17:40,997 --> 00:17:42,913
but I'm not too proud
to admit

444
00:17:43,013 --> 00:17:44,429
the mistakes I've made
in my life.

445
00:17:44,513 --> 00:17:46,442
And this year oof

446
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:49,731
this year, I've just
screwed up everything.

447
00:17:49,941 --> 00:17:51,708
Uh...

448
00:17:51,966 --> 00:17:53,333
Uh, I don't know.

449
00:17:53,497 --> 00:17:55,559
Remember that one summer
you came to visit me

450
00:17:55,643 --> 00:17:57,348
at my lake house?

451
00:17:58,113 --> 00:17:59,245
You borrowed my car,

452
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:01,179
and you forgot to put
the parking brake on. -

453
00:18:01,263 --> 00:18:02,838
As we had dinner,
I had to watch my Saab

454
00:18:02,923 --> 00:18:03,923
99 Turbo...

455
00:18:04,053 --> 00:18:07,059
...roll down the hill and sink
to the bottom of Lake Habeeb.

456
00:18:07,143 --> 00:18:08,269
You said it was the

457
00:18:08,353 --> 00:18:09,509
that was the first time
you'd seen me cry.

458
00:18:10,909 --> 00:18:13,099
Oh, Tommy.
Tommy.

459
00:18:13,745 --> 00:18:17,924
Well, listen, depending on what
we find out from this biopsy...

460
00:18:18,723 --> 00:18:20,831
I might be coming to ask you

461
00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:23,042
to play a bigger role
in the foundation.

462
00:18:23,433 --> 00:18:25,139
- Oh.
- Eh, Jackson's my first choice,

463
00:18:25,223 --> 00:18:27,099
but I just don't want to
pressure him

464
00:18:27,183 --> 00:18:29,042
into doing something
that makes him unhappy.

465
00:18:29,127 --> 00:18:31,583
Kit Cat, the foundation
is your life.

466
00:18:31,668 --> 00:18:33,245
Not as long
as Richard needs me.

467
00:18:33,353 --> 00:18:34,487
Mnh-mnh.

468
00:18:35,053 --> 00:18:36,929
I gave up on him once.

469
00:18:37,013 --> 00:18:38,389
I'm never
doing that again.

470
00:18:38,517 --> 00:18:39,745
Oh.

471
00:18:44,042 --> 00:18:47,315
I already informed pathology
to put a rush on the report.

472
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,659
You okay?

473
00:18:48,744 --> 00:18:51,515
I'd say we should bring in
someone who isn't family...

474
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,306
That person
doesn't exist.

475
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:54,737
Let's go.

476
00:18:55,393 --> 00:18:56,573
Ten blade.

477
00:18:56,658 --> 00:18:58,389
Hey, hey! Hey, stop!

478
00:18:58,473 --> 00:18:59,502
Wait! Don't cut! Okay?

479
00:18:59,587 --> 00:19:01,333
- Damn it, DeLuca!
- Just stop, okay?

480
00:19:01,513 --> 00:19:02,886
I- I'm sorry,
but I found something.

481
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:04,766
I was going over
Dr. Webber's history again,

482
00:19:04,851 --> 00:19:07,009
and he got a hip replacement
three years ago in Boston.

483
00:19:07,093 --> 00:19:09,502
Richard Webber
is sedated on the table.

484
00:19:09,587 --> 00:19:11,598
You need to step away
from the sterile field

485
00:19:11,683 --> 00:19:12,635
and wait outside!

486
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,177
And you can tell us about it
when we're finished.

487
00:19:14,261 --> 00:19:15,889
- No, no, no. How about now? Huh?
- Are you

488
00:19:17,053 --> 00:19:18,513
Gonna listen to me now?

489
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:21,678
That's it.

490
00:19:21,763 --> 00:19:23,629
You're done.
Get out.

491
00:19:23,714 --> 00:19:24,833
- Uh, we need to re-sterilize.
- Bailey.

492
00:19:24,917 --> 00:19:26,284
No, no, no.
B-Bailey, listen to me, okay?

493
00:19:26,368 --> 00:19:28,254
Look, you don't need to do
the biopsy, alright?

494
00:19:28,339 --> 00:19:30,379
His hip replacement
was made out of cobalt.

495
00:19:30,495 --> 00:19:32,138
We did a heavy metals test.

496
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:33,809
Wh... It came back negative,
right?

497
00:19:33,893 --> 00:19:35,082
Not for cobalt.

498
00:19:35,167 --> 00:19:38,083
That test is mercury,
arsenic, and lead.

499
00:19:38,282 --> 00:19:39,318
We wouldn't see that.

500
00:19:39,403 --> 00:19:40,543
Right.

501
00:19:40,723 --> 00:19:42,660
And if that hip is
deteriorating, Bailey,

502
00:19:42,745 --> 00:19:45,457
cobalt poisoning would explain
the dementia, the depression,

503
00:19:45,542 --> 00:19:48,118
hallucinations, tremors
everything, okay?

504
00:19:48,303 --> 00:19:49,469
And every second
that it stays in his body,

505
00:19:49,553 --> 00:19:50,825
he's
he's getting sicker.

506
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:52,429
Bailey, please trust me.

507
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:56,636
Change of plans.

508
00:19:56,721 --> 00:19:58,177
We need to draw some blood.

509
00:19:58,262 --> 00:19:59,262
D...

510
00:20:00,848 --> 00:20:03,059
DeLuca, run this down
to the lab.

511
00:20:03,143 --> 00:20:04,429
Tell them the chief says

512
00:20:04,513 --> 00:20:06,176
move this
to the front of the line.

513
00:20:06,393 --> 00:20:08,073
- Run!
- Okay. Okay.

514
00:20:19,846 --> 00:20:22,502
You really think a hip replacement

515
00:20:22,587 --> 00:20:23,753
- could've caused all this?
- Mm-hmm.

516
00:20:23,837 --> 00:20:25,963
It's a metal-on-metal joint,

517
00:20:26,048 --> 00:20:28,010
which means
it's entirely possible

518
00:20:28,095 --> 00:20:30,388
that the friction caused the hip
to wear away over time.

519
00:20:30,473 --> 00:20:32,778
I-I confirmed it with
the hospital in Boston today.

520
00:20:32,862 --> 00:20:34,889
They used a chromium cobalt
alloy for his surgery.

521
00:20:34,973 --> 00:20:36,139
Cobalt in his blood stream

522
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:38,099
would explain
the neurotoxic symptoms.

523
00:20:38,183 --> 00:20:40,182
Okay, so,
cobalt level's...

524
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:42,299
- 200?
- Oh.

525
00:20:42,393 --> 00:20:44,411
The average level in a healthy
adult male is around 8.

526
00:20:44,495 --> 00:20:45,871
That's 25 times
more than it should be.

527
00:20:45,955 --> 00:20:47,251
How permanent
is this damage?

528
00:20:47,336 --> 00:20:48,989
- I-It's not. It shouldn't be.
- You don't know that.

529
00:20:49,073 --> 00:20:50,139
First step is we have to

530
00:20:50,223 --> 00:20:52,269
get that cobalt out of him
and replace it.

531
00:20:52,353 --> 00:20:55,009
Well, go, go!
Get that thing out of him now!

532
00:20:55,093 --> 00:20:56,893
- Right.
- Alright, Taryn, find an empty O.R.

533
00:20:56,978 --> 00:20:58,149
- and prep Dr. Webber.
- Hey, I want to scrub in.

534
00:20:58,233 --> 00:21:00,109
And I want a house in Hawaii.
Go home.

535
00:21:00,194 --> 00:21:02,150
Chief, any resident
who found what I found

536
00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:03,349
would get the privilege
to scrub in. Please.

537
00:21:03,433 --> 00:21:04,699
Y-You can't
discriminate against me

538
00:21:04,783 --> 00:21:06,261
because you think
I have a problem.

539
00:21:06,346 --> 00:21:07,809
Lord, I'm sick of you.

540
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:10,061
Dr. Bailey...

541
00:21:10,147 --> 00:21:13,219
...he doesn't have to
touch Richard, but he's right.

542
00:21:13,303 --> 00:21:14,545
It's his diagnosis.

543
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:15,808
It's a career
defining moment.

544
00:21:15,893 --> 00:21:17,240
He should get to
be there.

545
00:21:17,325 --> 00:21:18,485
Not a finger.

546
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:20,326
Thank you. Scout's honor.

547
00:21:20,591 --> 00:21:22,312
Got to go find
Atticus Lincoln.

548
00:21:22,397 --> 00:21:24,834
Well, he's with Amelia,
and they're having a baby.

549
00:21:24,975 --> 00:21:26,679
Right.

550
00:21:26,889 --> 00:21:28,279
Well, not anymore.

551
00:21:28,364 --> 00:21:31,201
Hey, Mer.
Thank you.

552
00:21:31,381 --> 00:21:33,076
Don't make me
regret this.

553
00:21:33,161 --> 00:21:35,209
- I won't.
- Amazing catch.

554
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:37,117
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry,
sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

555
00:21:37,201 --> 00:21:38,679
Ah, doesn't hurt a bit.
Ah.

556
00:21:38,763 --> 00:21:40,639
Actually, you sh...
squeeze harder, actually,

557
00:21:40,723 --> 00:21:42,809
because, uh, because
I'm feeling nothing here.

558
00:21:42,893 --> 00:21:45,429
You're progressing very nicely, Amelia.

559
00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:47,929
Really?
Because it feels epically slow.

560
00:21:48,013 --> 00:21:49,373
D... Oh. Dr. Lincoln,

561
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:50,874
uh, we need you
in O.R. 1,

562
00:21:50,959 --> 00:21:53,995
explantation and replacement
of a hip prosthesis.

563
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:56,152
Kind of in the middle
of something here.

564
00:21:56,243 --> 00:21:57,659
It's for Richard.

565
00:21:57,744 --> 00:21:59,610
He tested positive
for cobalt toxicity.

566
00:21:59,695 --> 00:22:00,901
It's his hip.

567
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:02,362
Webber's got
a cobalt hip?

568
00:22:02,447 --> 00:22:04,663
Yeah, which is leaching
more cobalt into his blood

569
00:22:04,748 --> 00:22:05,664
the longer we speak.

570
00:22:05,749 --> 00:22:08,205
I I would not ask,

571
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:10,496
but he needs the best we have,
and he needs it now.

572
00:22:10,581 --> 00:22:12,207
Okay. I think
we're almost done here.

573
00:22:12,292 --> 00:22:14,050
No, you're still
only six centimeters.

574
00:22:14,135 --> 00:22:15,761
- You have hours.
- What?

575
00:22:15,853 --> 00:22:16,984
- Still?
- Yeah.

576
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:18,897
Oh. Okay. Go.

577
00:22:18,982 --> 00:22:20,469
- You sure?
- Yeah. Yeah, it's Richard.

578
00:22:20,553 --> 00:22:21,509
Go. Go.

579
00:22:21,593 --> 00:22:23,269
Mm. Mwah.

580
00:22:23,353 --> 00:22:24,889
Okay, go.
No, w-wait.

581
00:22:24,973 --> 00:22:26,362
Wait, do that again.

582
00:22:26,447 --> 00:22:28,623
Mm.

583
00:22:28,708 --> 00:22:29,864
Mm. Mm.

584
00:22:33,085 --> 00:22:35,003
That really does
help with the pain some.

585
00:22:35,128 --> 00:22:36,440
I told you!

586
00:22:36,525 --> 00:22:37,611
Okay, go, go!

587
00:22:37,696 --> 00:22:39,192
I'm pretty madly
in love with you, you know.

588
00:22:39,276 --> 00:22:40,349
Me, too! Go!

589
00:22:42,033 --> 00:22:43,869
- Bailey!
- Huh?

590
00:22:44,011 --> 00:22:45,177
Huh?

591
00:22:46,423 --> 00:22:48,469
Oh, uh, no, I'm gonna
help prep Richard.

592
00:22:48,554 --> 00:22:51,598
You stole the father of my baby
while I'm in active labor.

593
00:22:51,683 --> 00:22:52,889
Uh

594
00:22:52,973 --> 00:22:55,219
Ha... Uh

595
00:22:57,933 --> 00:22:58,973
Oh.

596
00:23:00,553 --> 00:23:02,139
- Oh!
- What?

597
00:23:02,223 --> 00:23:04,143
- Aah!
- Aah!

598
00:23:04,228 --> 00:23:06,768
No tension.
Perfect coaptation.

599
00:23:06,973 --> 00:23:09,599
Just need to anchor
the muscle proximally

600
00:23:09,683 --> 00:23:10,967
and we get to
close her up.

601
00:23:11,052 --> 00:23:13,718
I saw a survey
that said 98% of women

602
00:23:13,803 --> 00:23:15,928
have been told
to smile more at work.

603
00:23:16,558 --> 00:23:19,308
Why is there so much pressure
to smile all the time?

604
00:23:19,393 --> 00:23:21,269
It's not like it makes us
better at our jobs.

605
00:23:21,353 --> 00:23:22,719
The only people
that smile all the time

606
00:23:22,803 --> 00:23:24,506
are clowns
and sociopaths.

607
00:23:24,591 --> 00:23:26,639
Dr. Avery,
are you almost done?

608
00:23:26,724 --> 00:23:28,098
Why?
You need my O.R.?

609
00:23:28,183 --> 00:23:29,834
No, but thank you.

610
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:31,139
Chief Bailey wanted me
to tell you

611
00:23:31,223 --> 00:23:32,719
we're taking Dr. Webber
to the O.R.

612
00:23:32,803 --> 00:23:34,444
because he has a hip
made of cobalt,

613
00:23:34,529 --> 00:23:35,776
which has been
slowly poisoning him.

614
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:37,219
- Wait, what?
- I know.

615
00:23:37,303 --> 00:23:38,545
Dr. DeLuca
figured it out.

616
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:39,719
DeLuca?

617
00:23:39,803 --> 00:23:40,827
Jackson, go.

618
00:23:40,912 --> 00:23:42,147
We can finish and close.

619
00:23:42,291 --> 00:23:43,748
- Got it?
- Yep.

620
00:23:46,393 --> 00:23:48,349
Score one for DeLuca.

621
00:23:48,433 --> 00:23:49,836
The way he's been acting,
I'm amazed anyone listened

622
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,108
to anything he had to say,

623
00:23:51,193 --> 00:23:52,508
least of all Grey.

624
00:23:52,593 --> 00:23:55,764
You seem very interested
in who Meredith Grey listens to.

625
00:23:56,037 --> 00:23:57,506
Do I?

626
00:23:58,011 --> 00:23:59,670
I hadn't noticed.

627
00:24:00,227 --> 00:24:02,053
Hmm.

628
00:24:03,996 --> 00:24:05,458
Schmitt, bovie.

629
00:24:05,612 --> 00:24:06,841
What are the odds

630
00:24:06,941 --> 00:24:09,692
that that thing
would just shatter like that?

631
00:24:09,778 --> 00:24:11,702
Well, maple bats
splinter easily.

632
00:24:11,787 --> 00:24:13,013
Why are they allowed?

633
00:24:13,098 --> 00:24:15,271
Well, they're trying to
phase them out, go back to ash.

634
00:24:15,356 --> 00:24:16,429
Oh, good.

635
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:20,622
Schmitt, can you get that,
please?

636
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:22,226
Oh, but then I wouldn't
be sterile.

637
00:24:22,553 --> 00:24:23,853
I know.

638
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:32,201
Okay.

639
00:24:32,286 --> 00:24:34,349
Some guy
named Winston says

640
00:24:34,434 --> 00:24:37,257
- that he can't stop thinking about you.
- No, no, no, no. Not that one.

641
00:24:37,341 --> 00:24:38,522
Okay.

642
00:24:38,607 --> 00:24:41,153
Grey texted, too,
and Bailey and Helm.

643
00:24:41,238 --> 00:24:42,372
Well,
what did they say?

644
00:24:42,457 --> 00:24:43,743
Ooh, it's a lot.
I'm reading.

645
00:24:43,828 --> 00:24:47,204
Dr. Webber has cobalt poisoning
from a hip replacement,

646
00:24:47,289 --> 00:24:49,325
and they're rushing him
into surgery to replace it.

647
00:24:49,410 --> 00:24:50,631
They think that it
explains everything

648
00:24:50,715 --> 00:24:51,768
that's wrong with him.

649
00:24:54,506 --> 00:24:56,560
Pierce, we can we can
page Altman if you need to

650
00:24:56,645 --> 00:24:59,771
No. No.
I'm I'm okay.

651
00:24:59,856 --> 00:25:01,218
I just need a second.

652
00:25:04,803 --> 00:25:07,044
Okay. Bovie.

653
00:25:20,113 --> 00:25:21,199
You're the one who paged.

654
00:25:21,291 --> 00:25:22,621
Mm.

655
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:29,077
I'm driving across
the Key Bridge

656
00:25:29,161 --> 00:25:31,528
in Baltimore
one night, early June,

657
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:34,771
sunset, weather's gorgeous,
slight breeze,

658
00:25:34,893 --> 00:25:36,679
sailboats on the water.

659
00:25:36,763 --> 00:25:38,009
There was a crimson sky.

660
00:25:38,093 --> 00:25:40,059
- Tom.
- A- And I see this guy,

661
00:25:40,143 --> 00:25:41,469
20-something,
on his phone,

662
00:25:41,553 --> 00:25:42,724
looking distraught,

663
00:25:42,809 --> 00:25:44,718
his face all
tightened up in anguish,

664
00:25:44,803 --> 00:25:46,763
and he's leaning way out
over the railing.

665
00:25:46,865 --> 00:25:48,912
And before I know what
I'm doing, I slam on my brakes,

666
00:25:48,996 --> 00:25:50,582
I run to him
"Don't do it! Don't"

667
00:25:50,667 --> 00:25:53,100
Cars lined up behind mine,
people leaning on their horns,

668
00:25:53,185 --> 00:25:54,639
but I had to stop him.

669
00:25:54,723 --> 00:25:56,708
I- I At least try.

670
00:25:56,793 --> 00:25:58,610
I couldn't let him
throw his life away.

671
00:25:59,075 --> 00:26:00,767
So, what happened?
Did you talk him down?

672
00:26:00,852 --> 00:26:01,509
Oh, no.

673
00:26:01,593 --> 00:26:04,099
It turns out he was just calling
into a radio station

674
00:26:04,183 --> 00:26:05,269
for some
free concert tickets,

675
00:26:05,353 --> 00:26:07,349
and the reception was better
out over the water.

676
00:26:07,433 --> 00:26:10,389
I just wanted to tell a story
to illustrate my point.

677
00:26:12,093 --> 00:26:13,810
Don't throw your life away,
Teddy.

678
00:26:13,895 --> 00:26:15,771
I hate that I have
dragged you into this.

679
00:26:15,856 --> 00:26:17,272
I hate
that I'm hurting you.

680
00:26:17,357 --> 00:26:18,313
Because you love me.

681
00:26:18,398 --> 00:26:19,678
I am marrying Owen.

682
00:26:19,763 --> 00:26:21,060
And I love you, too.

683
00:26:21,145 --> 00:26:22,436
Which means
I'm not giving up on you.

684
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:25,341
So, tonight,
I'll be in my car.

Okay, everyone.
We've done this a thousand times.

711
00:28:14,098 --> 00:28:15,139

Mostly sludge.

717
00:28:41,331 --> 00:28:43,308
I've never seen
this much tissue damage

718
00:28:43,393 --> 00:28:45,278
from a hip replacement
before.

719
00:28:46,222 --> 00:28:48,218

gluteus medius tendon.</i>

00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,059
Not just him.

722
00:28:51,144 --> 00:28:53,060
These hips were the new
standard for a while.

723
00:28:53,145 --> 00:28:55,471
Surgeons used to
beg their hospitals

724
00:28:55,556 --> 00:28:56,852
to invest in them,

725
00:28:56,937 --> 00:29:00,754
but, uh, if this is happening
to other people...

726
00:29:01,355 --> 00:29:02,997
it's gonna be
a game-changer, DeLuca.

727
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:06,428
Can someone get me
an update on Amelia?

728
00:29:09,927 --> 00:29:10,927
Ooh.

729
00:29:11,093 --> 00:29:12,340
Okay.

730
00:29:12,473 --> 00:29:14,794
Oh.

731
00:29:14,971 --> 00:29:15,989
How are we doing?

732
00:29:16,092 --> 00:29:17,808
Uh, contractions are

733
00:29:17,893 --> 00:29:19,044
less than
three minutes apart.

734
00:29:19,128 --> 00:29:20,393
She's doing great.

735
00:29:20,558 --> 00:29:22,151
- Ooh.
- Good. Can I take a look?

736
00:29:22,243 --> 00:29:23,828
Uh-huh. Ooh!

737
00:29:23,913 --> 00:29:25,388
I feel like my organs
are in a vice.

738
00:29:25,473 --> 00:29:26,487
Aah!

739
00:29:26,572 --> 00:29:28,982
Hey, I know you said
no medications, but

740
00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:30,495
There's fentanyl
in the epidural.

741
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:33,246
Nobody advertises that,
but Aah!

742
00:29:33,513 --> 00:29:35,706
Women are smart.

743
00:29:35,877 --> 00:29:37,698
We are evolved.
We are critical-thinking.

744
00:29:37,816 --> 00:29:40,229
How did the first woman
ever have a baby

745
00:29:40,314 --> 00:29:41,521
and then decide
to have another one?

746
00:29:41,605 --> 00:29:44,417
Aah!
Or let another woman have one?

747
00:29:44,502 --> 00:29:46,208
Oh.
How do humans exist?

748
00:29:46,293 --> 00:29:48,011
Why do we do this?

749
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:52,956
You do this because
you're so in love with someone

750
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:55,167
that the two of you
can't contain it all.

751
00:29:55,252 --> 00:29:58,348
So you make another person
out of that love.

752
00:30:00,513 --> 00:30:02,206
Oh, God.

753
00:30:02,593 --> 00:30:05,784
Bailey... I am so sorry.

754
00:30:06,245 --> 00:30:08,012
I'm awful.
I was not thinking about it.

755
00:30:08,097 --> 00:30:09,219
You can go.

756
00:30:09,303 --> 00:30:11,009
I ju... I deserve to
have this baby on my own.

757
00:30:11,093 --> 00:30:12,495
D... No.

758
00:30:12,752 --> 00:30:15,894
Now, that would go against
the rules of pregnancy club.

759
00:30:18,987 --> 00:30:20,389
The surgery went well,

760
00:30:20,473 --> 00:30:22,679
and the bandages should be
able to come off soon.

761
00:30:22,763 --> 00:30:24,099
Recovery will be slow.

762
00:30:24,183 --> 00:30:25,972
You'll need rehab
and speech therapy.

763
00:30:26,973 --> 00:30:30,308
See, Dad?
Everything was fine.

764
00:30:31,682 --> 00:30:33,348
- I came as fast as I could.
- Hi.

765
00:30:33,433 --> 00:30:34,284
How is she doing?

766
00:30:34,369 --> 00:30:37,300
Um... uh... we're great.

767
00:30:37,471 --> 00:30:39,433
Ms. Scott?

768
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:42,214
Why are you here?

769
00:30:42,775 --> 00:30:45,061
I I was in
the neighborhood,

770
00:30:45,146 --> 00:30:47,942
and I thought
maybe you might

771
00:30:48,027 --> 00:30:50,563
want to catch up
on your homework.

772
00:30:50,823 --> 00:30:52,059
Oh, my God.

773
00:30:52,143 --> 00:30:54,793
Dad, you're dating
my algebra teacher?

774
00:30:54,878 --> 00:30:56,679
Um... only kind of.

775
00:30:56,763 --> 00:30:58,219
It's just...

776
00:30:58,303 --> 00:31:00,309
We have the same dentist.
She set us up.

777
00:31:00,393 --> 00:31:02,059
I didn't know she was
your teacher at the time.

778
00:31:02,143 --> 00:31:04,808
We didn't want to tell you until
after the school year was over

779
00:31:05,001 --> 00:31:06,634
and you weren't
in my class.

780
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:10,316
Oh, honey. Please.
Don't be upset.

781
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:13,496
I'm not upset.
I'm trying to smile.

782
00:31:15,315 --> 00:31:16,763
Okay.

783
00:31:19,657 --> 00:31:22,419
Well, now we know why
the dad never swiped right.

784
00:31:22,685 --> 00:31:24,443
God, I hate set-ups.

785
00:31:24,763 --> 00:31:25,889
But if it makes
them happy...

786
00:31:28,433 --> 00:31:30,123
So, this lack of interest
in dating

787
00:31:30,208 --> 00:31:32,138
it's... it's only in regards
to yourself, right?

788
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:33,679
I mean,
just because I'm miserable

789
00:31:33,763 --> 00:31:35,263
doesn't mean
everyone else has to be.

790
00:31:35,348 --> 00:31:37,714
Okay.
So, I'm not wrong, then?

791
00:31:37,952 --> 00:31:39,679
'Cause I get the feeling
people are having conversations

792
00:31:39,763 --> 00:31:42,099
about my personal life
that I'm not privy to.

793
00:31:42,697 --> 00:31:44,591
You know,
you should smile more.

794
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,990
Hmm.

795
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:51,826
- Ohh!
- Okay, it's time to push.

796
00:31:51,911 --> 00:31:53,623
- Okay.
- No, I ca... I can't push anymore!

797
00:31:53,708 --> 00:31:55,139
- I can't! I can't!
- Oh, yes, you can.

798
00:31:55,223 --> 00:31:57,269
No, I can't! I'm done!
I'm dying! I can't!

799
00:31:57,353 --> 00:31:58,809
Okay, okay, but
but think of

800
00:31:58,893 --> 00:32:00,469
all those women you were
talking about,

801
00:32:00,553 --> 00:32:01,429
the women that do this every day.

802
00:32:01,513 --> 00:32:03,059
No, I hate those women!

803
00:32:03,143 --> 00:32:04,969
And they all have drugs
and masturbation and

804
00:32:05,053 --> 00:32:06,179
and then C-sections,

805
00:32:06,263 --> 00:32:07,309
and I don't even have Link!

806
00:32:07,393 --> 00:32:08,349
Ohhh!

807
00:32:08,433 --> 00:32:10,787
Uh, okay.

808
00:32:10,888 --> 00:32:12,038
Okay, here.
Sit up.

809
00:32:12,123 --> 00:32:13,893
- I can't! I can't! I can't do this!
- Okay.

810
00:32:13,978 --> 00:32:15,809
Tucker's father
wasn't with me, either.

811
00:32:15,893 --> 00:32:17,704
- So, move.
- Why? What are you doing?

812
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:19,826

813
00:32:19,926 --> 00:32:21,962

you can go if you need to.

00:34:29,223 --> 00:34:30,349

854
00:34:36,506 --> 00:34:38,349
Now, what about you?
Don't you have a wedding to get to?

855
00:34:38,433 --> 00:34:40,335
Ah, there's plenty of wine
to keep people happy.

856
00:34:41,711 --> 00:34:42,878
Oh, Schmitt, could you...?

857
00:34:42,963 --> 00:34:44,511
