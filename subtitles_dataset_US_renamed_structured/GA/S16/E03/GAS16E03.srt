1
00:00:03,888 --> 00:00:05,820
In the earliest days of medicine...

2
00:00:05,845 --> 00:00:07,860
we're going back thousands of years...

3
00:00:07,885 --> 00:00:10,078
doctors spoke of healing as a reunion.

4
00:00:10,103 --> 00:00:11,405
Come on. We're almost there.

5
00:00:11,406 --> 00:00:12,613
- Yeah.
- You tired?

6
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:14,332
No. Plenty left in the tank.

7
00:00:14,357 --> 00:00:16,381
Okay.

8
00:00:16,406 --> 00:00:18,395
Oh, would you look at that?

9
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,119
That's a shame.

10
00:00:20,144 --> 00:00:21,867
Not a bad morning at all.
We're only halfway there.

11
00:00:21,892 --> 00:00:23,317
- Hmm?
- Let's go. Come on.

12
00:00:23,342 --> 00:00:24,670
When we close a patient...

13
00:00:24,695 --> 00:00:25,997
- Back up. Watch your six.
- What-

14
00:00:26,022 --> 00:00:28,830
...connect severed tendons,
repair a liver...

15
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:30,485
Whoo! What?

16
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:32,289
...we're just reuniting the tissue.

17
00:00:32,314 --> 00:00:34,570
Nothing. That... looked heavy.

18
00:00:34,571 --> 00:00:36,107
Yeah, it's almost like
I'm strong or something.

19
00:00:36,132 --> 00:00:38,425
What's the matter?
These just glamour muscles?

20
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:40,907
Restoring what was there
before the illness.

21
00:00:42,046 --> 00:00:43,528
Ideally, it's a happy reunion.

22
00:00:46,485 --> 00:00:47,741
But things get tricky

23
00:00:47,766 --> 00:00:49,522
when we fail to make
the right connection.

24
00:00:49,522 --> 00:00:52,067
Or worse, when we reunite two things

25
00:00:52,068 --> 00:00:53,640
that were best kept apart.

26
00:00:53,665 --> 00:00:56,000
Dreamt about Jackson again last night.

27
00:00:56,025 --> 00:00:57,914
This time, I was in middle school

28
00:00:57,939 --> 00:00:59,506
and he was on the football team,

29
00:00:59,506 --> 00:01:02,120
and our beloved mascot
was the hot firefighter.

30
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:03,891
I'm keeping the baby.

31
00:01:04,623 --> 00:01:06,078
What?

32
00:01:06,103 --> 00:01:07,588
Oh, my God. Oh.

33
00:01:07,613 --> 00:01:10,431
Are... Are you... Are we happy?

34
00:01:10,456 --> 00:01:12,629
We are... bewildered?

35
00:01:12,654 --> 00:01:14,156
Well, yeah, yeah.

36
00:01:14,181 --> 00:01:16,482
I mean... I mean, how is this gonna work?

37
00:01:16,507 --> 00:01:18,739
Are you and Link gonna
live together, or...?

38
00:01:18,764 --> 00:01:20,365
Does Meredith know?

39
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:21,585
No.

40
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:22,692
Owen?

41
00:01:22,717 --> 00:01:24,288
No! No, no one knows!

42
00:01:24,313 --> 00:01:25,968
Yeah, except me, who somehow always knows

43
00:01:25,993 --> 00:01:27,420
about everyone's wombs.

44
00:01:27,445 --> 00:01:29,865
Tell me more about Jackson
and the firefighter?

45
00:01:29,866 --> 00:01:31,708
He says that they're just
friends, but he's lying.

46
00:01:31,733 --> 00:01:34,311
He just walked out of the fog
with a new girlfriend

47
00:01:34,336 --> 00:01:36,083
like I never existed.

48
00:01:36,108 --> 00:01:38,311
I actually might hate him.

49
00:01:38,335 --> 00:01:41,468
My teacher said hating someone
is like drinking poison

50
00:01:41,469 --> 00:01:43,319
and expecting the other person to die.

51
00:01:43,344 --> 00:01:44,395
Uh...

52
00:01:45,809 --> 00:01:47,554
Go get ready for school.

53
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:59,221
So, what do you get to do today?

54
00:01:59,246 --> 00:02:01,624
What are you working on?
Do you get to cut? Appy/choly?

55
00:02:01,625 --> 00:02:03,149
Why are you torturing yourself?

56
00:02:03,174 --> 00:02:05,139
Because I need something
to fantasize about

57
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:06,954
while I pick up fast-food wrappers.

58
00:02:06,979 --> 00:02:10,010
I'm running the ICU until Bailey
lets me out of the doghouse.

59
00:02:10,035 --> 00:02:11,399
No cutting. Nothing fancy.

60
00:02:11,424 --> 00:02:12,337
It's all fancy to me.

61
00:02:12,362 --> 00:02:13,899
How's your article coming along?

62
00:02:13,923 --> 00:02:16,191
- Any word from the website?
- Oh, um, yeah.

63
00:02:16,216 --> 00:02:18,205
They actually asked for three pitches,

64
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:19,385
so I sent them like 40.

65
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:20,774
- Let's hear them.
- You want to hear them?

66
00:02:20,799 --> 00:02:21,816
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

67
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:25,566
"The sicker you are, the richer we get."

68
00:02:26,633 --> 00:02:27,718
"If you die on our watch,

69
00:02:27,743 --> 00:02:29,003
we'll still bankrupt your family!"

70
00:02:29,028 --> 00:02:30,287
Oh.

71
00:02:30,312 --> 00:02:32,510
"You could be dead before
your insurance kicks in."

72
00:02:32,535 --> 00:02:34,281
Mer, this is not gonna earn you

73
00:02:34,306 --> 00:02:35,739
any friends in the medical community.

74
00:02:35,764 --> 00:02:38,817
Yes, well, the medical community
and I are in a fight.

75
00:02:40,591 --> 00:02:43,065
Oh. I think you better go.

76
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:44,732
The warden's watching you.

77
00:02:44,757 --> 00:02:45,878
Enh.

78
00:02:48,056 --> 00:02:50,512
Uh, well, you know that just
makes me want to go slower.

79
00:02:50,537 --> 00:02:52,210
Mm. Such a rebel.

80
00:02:55,862 --> 00:02:56,937
Ugh!

81
00:02:58,685 --> 00:03:00,431
Have fun.

82
00:03:05,629 --> 00:03:08,973
â™ª _

83
00:03:10,248 --> 00:03:11,994
Hey. New MRI machines
installed last night.

84
00:03:12,019 --> 00:03:13,313
Hey, that's great.

85
00:03:13,338 --> 00:03:15,465
Yeah, but we don't have the
right image-viewing software,

86
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:16,751
so we can't use them yet.

87
00:03:16,776 --> 00:03:18,690
Hey, it's baby steps.

88
00:03:22,303 --> 00:03:23,702
Richard Webber?

89
00:03:24,873 --> 00:03:26,619
Oh. Gemma.

90
00:03:26,644 --> 00:03:28,494
What... What... What are you doing here?

91
00:03:28,495 --> 00:03:30,830
Well, after I got fired, a friend of mine

92
00:03:30,855 --> 00:03:33,296
named Richard Webber
made a few phone calls,

93
00:03:33,321 --> 00:03:36,630
and those calls landed me here,
in the billing department.

94
00:03:36,655 --> 00:03:39,441
I'm 62 days sober.

95
00:03:39,466 --> 00:03:41,525
That's wonderful news.

96
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:44,372
Well, um, I guess we'll be
seeing more of each other.

97
00:03:44,397 --> 00:03:46,109
Yeah. Guess so.

98
00:03:47,592 --> 00:03:49,025
Bye.

99
00:03:50,126 --> 00:03:51,491
Amelia. Hi.

100
00:03:51,516 --> 00:03:53,053
Hey.

101
00:03:53,078 --> 00:03:55,692
And hello to you.

102
00:03:55,717 --> 00:03:58,747
Owen got paged to a trauma,
so I dropped off Leo.

103
00:03:58,772 --> 00:04:00,032
How you holding up?

104
00:04:00,057 --> 00:04:02,358
Three hours of sleep last night.

105
00:04:02,383 --> 00:04:04,055
- New record.
- Wow.

106
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,319
Yeah, I have no idea how I'm gonna...

107
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:10,731
Um, how I would... if I ever... um...

108
00:04:10,756 --> 00:04:12,641
Don't want to be late.

109
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:13,683
Great seeing you.

110
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:14,968
Yeah.

111
00:04:14,993 --> 00:04:16,912
Dr. Franklin to the CCU.

112
00:04:16,937 --> 00:04:19,169
Dr. Franklin to the CCU.

113
00:04:19,194 --> 00:04:22,120
Okay, let's run a trauma panel
and page Dr. Shepherd.

114
00:04:22,145 --> 00:04:23,579
No need. I'm here.

115
00:04:23,604 --> 00:04:26,252
Oh. Fine. MVC, GCS 10 upon arrival.

116
00:04:26,277 --> 00:04:27,954
Looks like there's a step-off in T12,

117
00:04:27,979 --> 00:04:29,204
and there's concern of paralysis...

118
00:04:29,228 --> 00:04:30,489
Uh, bup, bup, bup, bup, bup, bup.

119
00:04:30,514 --> 00:04:31,877
500 feet, Dr. Hunt.

120
00:04:31,902 --> 00:04:33,962
Very funny. Okay, let's get
the patient up to CT...

121
00:04:33,987 --> 00:04:35,495
I'm not joking. That's two strikes.

122
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,334
Well, then leave and I'll get Shepherd.

123
00:04:37,359 --> 00:04:38,811
This patient needs a neurosurgeon

124
00:04:38,836 --> 00:04:40,490
to check on his spinal cord now,
Dr. Hunt.

125
00:04:40,515 --> 00:04:42,281
You'd risk your patient's
mobility for your pride?

126
00:04:44,052 --> 00:04:46,423
Somebody page me when he's gone.

127
00:04:46,448 --> 00:04:48,888
Your lap colectomy
is ready for discharge,

128
00:04:48,913 --> 00:04:51,631
your emergency splenectomy's H&H
is stable,

129
00:04:51,656 --> 00:04:54,131
and Dr. Grey's liver mets patient is in,

130
00:04:54,156 --> 00:04:55,382
admitted for pre-op.

131
00:04:55,407 --> 00:04:57,256
For an ALPPS procedure!

132
00:04:57,281 --> 00:04:58,367
I know.

133
00:04:58,392 --> 00:05:00,173
Okay, you know how rare that is, right?

134
00:05:00,198 --> 00:05:01,700
How about a little enthusiasm?

135
00:05:01,725 --> 00:05:05,659
Dr. Grey got fired before her
patient was back from vacation.

136
00:05:05,684 --> 00:05:07,778
Yay!

137
00:05:07,803 --> 00:05:09,459
Okay.

138
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,384
Your father's blood pressure

139
00:05:11,409 --> 00:05:13,151
is still running low from dehydration.

140
00:05:13,176 --> 00:05:15,481
We're gonna place a catheter in his thigh

141
00:05:15,506 --> 00:05:17,287
to deliver fluids and meds.

142
00:05:17,312 --> 00:05:19,509
A cath... Uh, will there be blood?

143
00:05:19,534 --> 00:05:21,672
'Cause, see, like,
I got a thing about blood. I can't...

144
00:05:21,697 --> 00:05:23,468
Kenya, why don't you
give yourself a break?

145
00:05:23,493 --> 00:05:25,125
Go get something to eat,
grab a shower, and come back,

146
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:27,148
and by the time you do, we'll be done.

147
00:05:27,579 --> 00:05:29,348
It's a very simple procedure.

148
00:05:31,061 --> 00:05:32,565
Okay. Um...

149
00:05:34,568 --> 00:05:36,940
Daddy, I'm gonna go for a little bit,

150
00:05:36,965 --> 00:05:38,745
but I'll be right back, okay?

151
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:41,003
So, you better be here when I get back.

152
00:05:42,307 --> 00:05:43,741
Okay.

153
00:05:43,766 --> 00:05:45,487
Thank you.

154
00:05:46,807 --> 00:05:48,934
It's Bertram Hollister, 83 years old.

155
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:51,191
Wait for the patient, Parker.

156
00:05:51,216 --> 00:05:52,650
Eh...

157
00:05:52,675 --> 00:05:55,080
Good morning, Doc.
Sorry to keep you waiting.

158
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:57,685
I-I was trying to get my steps
in before I go under the knife.

159
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:59,664
- Oh...
- I know. No knife.

160
00:05:59,689 --> 00:06:01,156
Gets me more sympathy online

161
00:06:01,181 --> 00:06:02,858
when I make it all dramatic, you know?

162
00:06:02,883 --> 00:06:04,281
As you were.

163
00:06:04,306 --> 00:06:05,774
Uh, Bertram Hollister...

164
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:07,789
"Bertie." Call me Bertie, please.

165
00:06:07,814 --> 00:06:10,844
Okay. Bertie, 83,

166
00:06:10,869 --> 00:06:12,372
in for a scheduled, eh,

167
00:06:12,397 --> 00:06:14,282
percutaneous coronary intervention.

168
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:15,671
It's all quite simple.

169
00:06:15,696 --> 00:06:18,206
You'll be awake while I place
a small coronary stent

170
00:06:18,231 --> 00:06:19,976
to help open up some of the blockages

171
00:06:20,001 --> 00:06:21,503
and keep that heart of yours
nice and strong.

172
00:06:21,504 --> 00:06:23,319
H-How much time before the surgery?

173
00:06:23,344 --> 00:06:25,020
I want to get in as many steps as I can.

174
00:06:25,045 --> 00:06:28,041
Uh, we'll be back within an
hour, but don't push yourself.

175
00:06:28,066 --> 00:06:29,500
- Okay.
- And please ask for help...

176
00:06:29,525 --> 00:06:31,062
...if you start to develop any chest pain

177
00:06:31,087 --> 00:06:32,243
or shortness of breath.

178
00:06:32,268 --> 00:06:34,291
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

179
00:06:34,316 --> 00:06:35,576
Okay.

180
00:06:35,601 --> 00:06:38,389
But you're not my doctor.
Meredith Grey is my doctor.

181
00:06:38,414 --> 00:06:40,750
I understand that you're upset,
Ms. Gregory,

182
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:42,972
but I learned the ALPPS
procedure from Dr. Grey.

183
00:06:42,997 --> 00:06:44,048
She taught me.

184
00:06:44,073 --> 00:06:45,429
Don't talk to me about teaching.

185
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:47,141
I taught my entire career.

186
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:48,946
Some kids get it, some kids don't.

187
00:06:48,971 --> 00:06:51,481
And you never know which
is which until 10 years later,

188
00:06:51,506 --> 00:06:53,391
when you either get
a beautiful thank-you note,

189
00:06:53,416 --> 00:06:55,092
or you see on the news that one of them

190
00:06:55,117 --> 00:06:56,446
tried to rob a library naked.

191
00:06:57,895 --> 00:06:59,815
You don't have 10 years.

192
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,272
The tumor in your liver is...

193
00:07:01,297 --> 00:07:03,877
Meredith Grey told me
all about the tumor in my liver.

194
00:07:03,902 --> 00:07:07,274
And I told her I don't want some
kind of experimental surgery,

195
00:07:07,274 --> 00:07:08,777
I want to tackle my bucket list.

196
00:07:08,802 --> 00:07:09,818
So we made a deal.

197
00:07:09,843 --> 00:07:11,972
She told me,
"Go on your trip and come back

198
00:07:11,997 --> 00:07:14,019
and see me after six weeks."

199
00:07:14,044 --> 00:07:16,068
But if I'd known she was fired,

200
00:07:16,093 --> 00:07:18,082
I'd still be on a beach in Costa Rica!

201
00:07:18,107 --> 00:07:20,687
Dr. Grey is the whole reason I'm here!

202
00:07:20,712 --> 00:07:22,354
You and me both.

203
00:07:22,355 --> 00:07:24,761
Shirley, I've already spoken
to the chief of surgery.

204
00:07:24,786 --> 00:07:26,636
She says she's going to be there
every step of the...

205
00:07:26,661 --> 00:07:28,060
Young lady...

206
00:07:28,085 --> 00:07:29,734
my answer is no.

207
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:33,025
Now, either get me Dr. Grey,
or check me out of here

208
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:35,803
and just let me live my life till I die.

209
00:07:42,249 --> 00:07:45,315
Dr. Medico to the psych unit.

210
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,641
Dr. Medico to the psych unit.

211
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,109
- Hi.
- Hi.

212
00:07:54,785 --> 00:07:56,739
Have you, uh, heard anything?

213
00:07:56,764 --> 00:07:58,093
No, I've just been waiting.

214
00:07:58,118 --> 00:08:00,211
But they said that she fell
at a construction site?

215
00:08:00,236 --> 00:08:02,295
She fell into a construction site.

216
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,371
- Oh.
- You know Heather.

217
00:08:03,396 --> 00:08:04,829
- She's always on her phone.
- Right.

218
00:08:04,854 --> 00:08:06,685
Um, excuse me?

219
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:09,056
Um, I'm looking for the family
of Heather Peterson.

220
00:08:09,081 --> 00:08:10,272
Oh, that's us.

221
00:08:10,297 --> 00:08:11,545
We're sisters.

222
00:08:12,936 --> 00:08:15,758
We were able to resuscitate her
once she arrived,

223
00:08:15,783 --> 00:08:19,530
but the CT revealed
severe injuries to the brain.

224
00:08:20,574 --> 00:08:21,973
I-I don't understand.

225
00:08:21,998 --> 00:08:23,119
I d... I don't...

226
00:08:23,144 --> 00:08:24,681
Are you saying, um...

227
00:08:24,706 --> 00:08:27,355
What are you saying?

228
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:29,855
She fell about 30 feet.

229
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,007
She fractured her skull.

230
00:08:32,032 --> 00:08:34,022
We've done everything we could,

231
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:37,181
but I'm afraid there are
no signs of brain activity.

232
00:08:37,206 --> 00:08:39,569
I-I...

233
00:08:39,594 --> 00:08:42,042
I don't understand. I...

234
00:08:42,067 --> 00:08:43,548
Is she...

235
00:08:44,178 --> 00:08:45,784
Is she brain-dead?

236
00:08:45,809 --> 00:08:49,291
We, um... need to wait several more hours

237
00:08:49,316 --> 00:08:53,110
and then run one more exam
to make the final determination,

238
00:08:53,135 --> 00:08:55,333
but it seems likely.

239
00:08:55,358 --> 00:08:56,784
I'm sorry.

00:09:08,626 --> 00:09:11,241
Dr. Everly to the ER.

242
00:09:11,266 --> 00:09:12,779
- Dr. Everly to the ER.
- Hey, I was just trying to call.

243
00:09:12,804 --> 00:09:13,960
Have you told anyone?

244
00:09:13,985 --> 00:09:15,418
Just Jo.

245
00:09:15,443 --> 00:09:17,849
Which was apparently very wrong
and I'm sorry.

246
00:09:17,874 --> 00:09:19,723
Did something happen?

247
00:09:19,748 --> 00:09:21,807
N-No. Just, uh...
Just... We're not there yet,

248
00:09:21,832 --> 00:09:24,203
at the... telling-people part.

249
00:09:24,228 --> 00:09:26,529
Jo's my best friend.
And you told Maggie, so...

250
00:09:27,631 --> 00:09:29,098
I'll just stick with "I'm sorry."

251
00:09:29,123 --> 00:09:30,869
Can I ask how you're feeling?

252
00:09:30,894 --> 00:09:34,203
Mm. Sleepy... and pukey.

253
00:09:34,228 --> 00:09:36,668
My two favorite dwarves.

254
00:09:38,603 --> 00:09:40,105
Bird.

255
00:09:41,908 --> 00:09:43,479
Bird.

256
00:09:43,504 --> 00:09:45,632
Ma'am, are you okay?

257
00:09:45,657 --> 00:09:46,918
Bird.

258
00:09:47,423 --> 00:09:48,983
Bird?

259
00:09:49,154 --> 00:09:51,385
Ma'am, are you dizzy?

260
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:55,202
Oh.

261
00:09:55,227 --> 00:09:57,980
Okay. Uh, ma'am, ma'am,
my name is Dr. Lincoln,

262
00:09:58,005 --> 00:10:00,133
and we'd like to try to get you
some help, okay?

263
00:10:00,158 --> 00:10:01,834
Bird.

264
00:10:03,447 --> 00:10:04,729
Bird!

265
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,213
Absolutely not.

266
00:10:07,238 --> 00:10:10,060
But she won't let anyone touch
her, including you.

267
00:10:10,085 --> 00:10:12,943
Which is very sad,
and in my opinion, very foolish,

268
00:10:12,968 --> 00:10:15,477
but I am not granting
Meredith Grey privileges.

269
00:10:15,502 --> 00:10:17,526
So, would you say
because Dr. Grey's gone,

270
00:10:17,551 --> 00:10:19,060
we're giving worse care?

271
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:22,027
Uh, Qadri, keep your rhetorical
questions to yourself.

272
00:10:22,052 --> 00:10:23,032
It is one surgery.

273
00:10:23,057 --> 00:10:25,593
One surgery too many, Dr. Karev.

274
00:10:25,618 --> 00:10:27,904
Look... I already made a concession

275
00:10:27,904 --> 00:10:30,136
by agreeing to let you perform
a complicated surgery

276
00:10:30,161 --> 00:10:31,630
that you have only observed.

277
00:10:31,655 --> 00:10:34,615
I made this concession because
I have faith in you.

278
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,485
If your patient doesn't share that faith,

279
00:10:36,486 --> 00:10:38,788
uh, I would direct my energy
into convincing her.

280
00:10:38,813 --> 00:10:40,628
But Meredith Grey is not stepping foot

281
00:10:40,652 --> 00:10:41,900
into one of my ORs.

282
00:10:43,773 --> 00:10:46,629
What if she doesn't have to
set foot in the OR to help?

283
00:10:48,411 --> 00:10:50,295
I'm listening.

284
00:10:51,466 --> 00:10:53,108
Contrast.

285
00:10:53,133 --> 00:10:55,226
Are you feeling any discomfort, Mr...

286
00:10:55,251 --> 00:10:57,761
um... Bertie?

287
00:10:57,786 --> 00:11:01,519
I haven't felt this good since
my wife and I went to Woodstock.

288
00:11:01,544 --> 00:11:02,839
You know what I mean?

289
00:11:02,864 --> 00:11:04,019
You went to Woodstock?

290
00:11:04,044 --> 00:11:05,650
We were a little on the older side,

291
00:11:05,675 --> 00:11:08,151
but Lois liked to keep up with the kids.

292
00:11:08,176 --> 00:11:10,403
We left when it started to rain.

293
00:11:10,736 --> 00:11:12,864
I don't have too many regrets in my life,

294
00:11:12,889 --> 00:11:15,398
but I sure regret leaving
that party early.

295
00:11:15,423 --> 00:11:16,551
What else?

296
00:11:16,576 --> 00:11:19,559
Not writing enough love letters to Lois.

297
00:11:21,224 --> 00:11:24,347
Not quitting my job earlier.

298
00:11:27,079 --> 00:11:31,534
Drinking too much when my...
my kid got sick.

299
00:11:34,601 --> 00:11:37,041
And the train station...

300
00:11:37,272 --> 00:11:40,372
It was... It was supposed to be 3:00.

301
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:44,456
It was so... It was so hot.

302
00:11:44,481 --> 00:11:45,730
It was...

303
00:11:49,259 --> 00:11:50,692
What was I saying?

304
00:11:50,717 --> 00:11:53,321
Um, you were... you were
talking about your regrets.

305
00:11:53,517 --> 00:11:56,062
- Heparin.
- Oh, right.

306
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:59,410
Can't change the past, can you?

307
00:12:02,209 --> 00:12:04,791
But I'll tell you,
I think I got the secret.

308
00:12:05,018 --> 00:12:06,501
It's love.

309
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:09,277
Love makes it all worthwhile.

310
00:12:09,629 --> 00:12:11,002
All of it, Bertie?

311
00:12:11,027 --> 00:12:14,418
Really? The heartbreak, the loss,

312
00:12:14,443 --> 00:12:16,605
the back-stabbing,
the petty behavior of people

313
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:17,967
that you thought you could trust?

314
00:12:17,992 --> 00:12:19,586
Love makes all of that worthwhile?

315
00:12:21,565 --> 00:12:23,901
Uh, I'm Dr. Karev. I'm the chief.

316
00:12:23,926 --> 00:12:26,646
I-I don't know if Heather ever
discussed her wishes with you,

317
00:12:26,671 --> 00:12:30,986
but if not, um,
then you can decide if you...

318
00:12:31,551 --> 00:12:34,361
If we want to unplug our sister.

319
00:12:34,918 --> 00:12:38,738
Um... I don't know
what Heather would want,

320
00:12:38,763 --> 00:12:40,787
but I can't imagine it's th...

321
00:12:40,812 --> 00:12:42,239
No. No. No.

322
00:12:42,264 --> 00:12:43,945
This is not how we end, okay?

323
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:47,105
We are family, and I know that
we have drifted apart,

324
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:49,119
but this can't be how we end.

325
00:12:49,144 --> 00:12:52,922
What, she just... she walks
into a dig-site and dies?

326
00:12:53,467 --> 00:12:55,126
Come on. I don't accept that.

327
00:12:55,126 --> 00:12:57,046
I'm sorry. This is not how we end.

328
00:12:57,071 --> 00:12:58,155
Where are you going?

329
00:12:58,192 --> 00:12:59,507
I don't know!

330
00:12:59,532 --> 00:13:00,888
Okay.

331
00:13:02,593 --> 00:13:05,207
Yeah, she's pretty badly dehydrated.

332
00:13:05,232 --> 00:13:06,422
Should we get her a banana bag?

333
00:13:06,447 --> 00:13:07,637
I don't want to poke her until

334
00:13:07,662 --> 00:13:08,922
I can explain what I'm doing.

335
00:13:08,947 --> 00:13:10,484
Interpreter's been paged.

336
00:13:10,509 --> 00:13:11,665
Bird.

337
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:13,158
Bird!

338
00:13:19,702 --> 00:13:21,864
Oh.

339
00:13:26,923 --> 00:13:29,919
She's Korean. She says
she's lost... something.

340
00:13:29,944 --> 00:13:31,621
Ask if she knows her name.

341
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:37,207
Oh Soyoung.

342
00:13:37,232 --> 00:13:39,116
She knows her name. Her name's Soyoung.

343
00:13:39,141 --> 00:13:40,887
Ask her if she knows what year it is.

344
00:13:43,795 --> 00:13:45,023
Hey, what's going on?

345
00:13:45,048 --> 00:13:46,377
We're not sure.

346
00:13:46,402 --> 00:13:49,294
We found her lost in a hallway,
leaning against a wall.

347
00:13:49,319 --> 00:13:51,778
She's dizzy and very dehydrated.

348
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:55,906
She said she has a friend that's
a bird and she lost him.

349
00:13:56,511 --> 00:13:58,414
I don't know.
She seems a little disoriented.

350
00:13:58,439 --> 00:14:00,185
All right, let's get her hydrated,

351
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:02,120
and we'll give her a work-up
just in case.

352
00:14:02,145 --> 00:14:04,267
And see if you can get her
to call her family.

353
00:14:04,292 --> 00:14:05,523
Okay.

354
00:14:07,576 --> 00:14:09,566
Entering the ER!

355
00:14:09,591 --> 00:14:12,135
Wh... Whoa, whoa.

356
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,519
Just trying to make this easy, Hunt.

357
00:14:15,042 --> 00:14:16,220
Here you go.

358
00:14:16,245 --> 00:14:18,546
All right.

359
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:28,036
If Dr. Grey's not with you,
don't even bother.

360
00:14:29,716 --> 00:14:31,011
Dr. Grey!

361
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:32,538
How was Machu Picchu?

362
00:14:32,563 --> 00:14:34,934
Ugh. I thought if my liver
didn't kill me,

363
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:36,289
that bus ride was gonna.

364
00:14:36,314 --> 00:14:37,538
Ms. Gregory,

365
00:14:37,563 --> 00:14:39,170
I have permission from the chief

366
00:14:39,195 --> 00:14:40,802
to allow Dr. Grey to observe

367
00:14:40,827 --> 00:14:42,710
and assist remotely on your surgery.

368
00:14:42,735 --> 00:14:44,689
Meaning that they'll have me
on video-chat

369
00:14:44,714 --> 00:14:47,501
so I can see every move
that Dr. Karev is making.

370
00:14:47,526 --> 00:14:49,794
Fortunately, my supervisor owes me.

371
00:14:49,819 --> 00:14:52,363
So, just your face? Not your hands?

372
00:14:52,388 --> 00:14:54,133
Remote surgery is practiced
all over the world.

373
00:14:54,158 --> 00:14:57,292
I'd rather do it myself,
but a judge has decided

374
00:14:57,317 --> 00:14:59,862
that I better stay on this side
of the road instead.

375
00:14:59,887 --> 00:15:01,425
So, it's the next best thing.

376
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:03,056
That judge sounds like a horse's ass.

377
00:15:03,081 --> 00:15:05,210
I won't fight you on that.

378
00:15:06,901 --> 00:15:08,407
She was a good student?

379
00:15:08,432 --> 00:15:10,866
Shirley, she was a great
student, excellent.

380
00:15:10,891 --> 00:15:12,395
You're in very good hands.

381
00:15:16,099 --> 00:15:17,351
All right, then.

382
00:15:17,376 --> 00:15:18,879
But don't kill me.

383
00:15:18,904 --> 00:15:20,302
Okay. Okay.

384
00:15:20,327 --> 00:15:21,656
We will text you when we are ready.

385
00:15:21,681 --> 00:15:22,930
Get back to work!

386
00:15:26,172 --> 00:15:27,509
Okay, okay.

387
00:15:27,534 --> 00:15:29,971
Whoa, whoa. Hang on. Stop squirming.

388
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:31,321
Hey.

389
00:15:31,346 --> 00:15:33,162
Hi... Hi. What...
What are you doing here?

390
00:15:33,187 --> 00:15:35,106
Um, Koracick. What are you doing here?

391
00:15:35,131 --> 00:15:37,675
Oh, you know, just... failing.

392
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:40,627
I mean, really, deeply failing

393
00:15:40,652 --> 00:15:43,509
in a poo-covered,
publicly humiliating way.

394
00:15:43,534 --> 00:15:45,176
Let me. Let me.

395
00:15:45,201 --> 00:15:46,877
Okay. Thanks. Just go under.

396
00:15:46,902 --> 00:15:47,883
- Yeah. I got her. Hey.
- Okay.

397
00:15:47,908 --> 00:15:49,307
It j-just... just went up her back.

398
00:15:49,332 --> 00:15:50,592
I mean, it's... it's everywhere.

399
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:52,536
Yeah. Well, it's bad.
It's a bad one. Yeah.

400
00:15:52,561 --> 00:15:53,960
Okay. There we go.

401
00:15:53,985 --> 00:15:55,105
You're good.

402
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:57,120
And, boom. And there you go.

403
00:15:57,145 --> 00:15:58,821
It's... I think we got it.

404
00:15:58,846 --> 00:16:02,710
And here... we... are. Aah.

405
00:16:02,735 --> 00:16:04,585
- Wow. Thanks.
- Yeah.

406
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:06,391
- I got it.
- Oh, thanks.

407
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:08,196
Mm. Mm.

408
00:16:08,221 --> 00:16:11,162
Okay, so, I, uh...
I guess we'll just, um...

409
00:16:11,763 --> 00:16:13,613
I guess we'll just go to the park.

410
00:16:13,638 --> 00:16:15,279
Hey, why don't...

411
00:16:15,304 --> 00:16:17,467
why don't we give her a tour
of the hospital, hmm?

412
00:16:17,492 --> 00:16:18,856
I got a couple scans to look at,

413
00:16:18,881 --> 00:16:20,905
and I'm not ready to say goodbye
to you both yet.

414
00:16:20,929 --> 00:16:22,407
You're just humoring me

415
00:16:22,408 --> 00:16:24,500
because you know I miss
the smell of blood.

416
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:25,784
And that's why you love me.

417
00:16:25,809 --> 00:16:27,035
I do.

418
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:29,015
Dr. Bowie to Pediatrics.

419
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:31,062
Dr. Bowie to Pediatrics.

420
00:16:31,087 --> 00:16:32,972
Hey.

421
00:16:32,997 --> 00:16:34,187
Hi.

422
00:16:34,212 --> 00:16:36,132
How you feeling? Any soreness?

423
00:16:36,157 --> 00:16:37,834
Eh, that's a personal question.

424
00:16:38,865 --> 00:16:40,056
What... What happened here?

425
00:16:40,081 --> 00:16:42,243
Oh, run over with a 4x4
on a walk-through.

426
00:16:42,268 --> 00:16:43,510
Ah. Let me see.

427
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:45,568
- Mm.
- Okay.

428
00:16:45,593 --> 00:16:47,686
Yeah, I can... I can make that disappear.

429
00:16:47,711 --> 00:16:48,797
Oh, really?

430
00:16:48,822 --> 00:16:50,255
- Yeah, of course.
- Wow.

431
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,269
I can throw a couple sutures in there.

432
00:16:52,294 --> 00:16:53,762
It'll heal up much better.

433
00:16:53,787 --> 00:16:55,568
I mean, unless you like scars.

434
00:16:55,593 --> 00:16:56,783
Well, scars are cool.

435
00:16:56,808 --> 00:16:57,999
Facial scars, though?

436
00:16:58,024 --> 00:16:59,492
Yeah, those are the coolest kind.

437
00:16:59,517 --> 00:17:00,846
You don't want to see my skills?

438
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:04,804
Come on.

439
00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:07,304
It's not lying not to tell people, right?

440
00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:09,527
- It's your first trimester.
- Mm.

441
00:17:09,552 --> 00:17:11,297
I'm just so used to rigorous honesty...

442
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:12,998
...I feel like I'm lying to
everyone I talk to.

443
00:17:13,023 --> 00:17:15,637
Honesty and privacy
are not mutually exclusive.

444
00:17:15,662 --> 00:17:17,894
Ooh. I like that.

445
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:19,526
Pretend you have the nuclear codes,

446
00:17:19,551 --> 00:17:21,167
and if you tell anyone you're pregnant,

447
00:17:21,168 --> 00:17:22,531
then the whole world will end.

448
00:17:22,556 --> 00:17:24,650
That feels entirely possible.

449
00:17:24,674 --> 00:17:26,385
So, Ms. Oh doesn't want a work-up.

450
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:28,573
She keeps insisting that nothing's wrong,

451
00:17:28,598 --> 00:17:30,830
but her passport's from South Korea.

452
00:17:30,855 --> 00:17:32,531
I'm nervous she has dementia,

453
00:17:32,556 --> 00:17:35,205
and she somehow got herself
on a plane to the U.S.

454
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:38,052
Okay. We should just admit her
for her own safety,

455
00:17:38,077 --> 00:17:40,471
at least until we can locate some family.

456
00:17:41,653 --> 00:17:43,330
Hi, Bertie.

457
00:17:43,355 --> 00:17:44,788
How you feeling?

458
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:46,941
Restless.

459
00:17:46,966 --> 00:17:49,684
I hate hospital rooms.
Can I take a walk yet?

460
00:17:49,709 --> 00:17:52,705
The sedation has just worn off.
I think it's best if you...

461
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:55,540
How about... we walk together?

462
00:17:58,806 --> 00:17:59,858
Deal.

463
00:18:03,736 --> 00:18:07,254
And thank you
for always sticking up for me

464
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:08,881
when we were little......

465
00:18:08,881 --> 00:18:10,870
teaching me it's okay to say no...

466
00:18:12,735 --> 00:18:16,599
...and giving me your sweatshirt
to wrap around my waist

467
00:18:16,624 --> 00:18:18,636
when I got my period at school.

468
00:18:18,636 --> 00:18:20,313
I'm sorry we fell apart.

469
00:18:20,338 --> 00:18:23,160
If there was anything I could do...

470
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:25,128
'Scuse me.

471
00:18:26,276 --> 00:18:28,542
What... What are you...
What are you doing?

472
00:18:28,567 --> 00:18:30,348
This whole building is bad vibes.

473
00:18:30,373 --> 00:18:33,334
I can feel them pulsating
off the walls, you know?

474
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:35,036
And that's not gonna help her heal.

475
00:18:35,061 --> 00:18:37,490
She needs good energy.

476
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:38,785
There's nothing to heal.

477
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:41,285
Well, he said that nothing's
official for a few hours.

478
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:44,931
So... she's got time.

479
00:18:44,956 --> 00:18:47,118
That's just a technicality, Haylee.

480
00:18:47,143 --> 00:18:48,542
She's not gonna get better.

481
00:18:48,567 --> 00:18:50,174
I know it's difficult, but can we...

482
00:18:50,199 --> 00:18:53,334
Okay, so, do you want me to just
pull the plug out of the wall?

483
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:55,348
Look, just because she can't talk to us

484
00:18:55,373 --> 00:18:57,257
doesn't mean that she's not in there.

485
00:18:57,282 --> 00:18:58,681
That is exactly what it means.

486
00:18:58,706 --> 00:19:00,382
Really? Oh, okay.

487
00:19:00,407 --> 00:19:01,980
Well, why were you just talking to her?

488
00:19:02,005 --> 00:19:05,278
Because... I'm grieving
and I'm irrational.

489
00:19:05,303 --> 00:19:07,570
You're giving up,
just like you did with Mom.

490
00:19:07,595 --> 00:19:09,150
Maybe if you got some fresh air...

491
00:19:09,175 --> 00:19:10,921
Don't you dare talk to me about Mom.

492
00:19:10,946 --> 00:19:13,282
I visited her every day
while you were off

493
00:19:13,307 --> 00:19:15,139
Eat-Pray-Loving yourself across Thailand!

494
00:19:15,164 --> 00:19:17,106
I paid for her Reiki!

495
00:19:17,131 --> 00:19:18,947
Reiki? Reiki doesn't cure cancer!

496
00:19:18,972 --> 00:19:20,370
They make a decision yet?

497
00:19:20,395 --> 00:19:21,967
You always resented me for that trip!

498
00:19:21,992 --> 00:19:24,537
Because grown-ups stay in town
when their parents are dying!

499
00:19:24,562 --> 00:19:25,999
Maybe if you'd seen my therapist...

500
00:19:26,024 --> 00:19:28,170
I think we're a little
ways off from that.

501
00:19:28,195 --> 00:19:31,146
A psychic is not a therapist!

502
00:19:34,905 --> 00:19:36,546
Patch her in.

503
00:19:42,439 --> 00:19:44,705
- Hey.
- Hi, everybody.

504
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:47,553
- Hi, Bohkee!
- We miss you, Dr. Grey.

505
00:19:47,578 --> 00:19:49,359
I miss all of you, Qadri.

506
00:19:49,384 --> 00:19:51,705
Okay, we're gonna be switching
you to the overhead camera.

507
00:19:53,199 --> 00:19:54,632
Okay, can you see?

508
00:19:54,657 --> 00:19:56,299
I'm good.

509
00:19:56,324 --> 00:19:57,861
Karev, you have to hurry

510
00:19:57,886 --> 00:19:59,933
because I only have
a 15-minute lunch break.

511
00:20:02,072 --> 00:20:04,096
I'm kidding.

512
00:20:07,836 --> 00:20:09,583
Okay.

513
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:10,971
10 blade.

514
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:23,250
Okay, I've accessed
the femoral vein for you.

515
00:20:23,275 --> 00:20:26,542
Now, feed the guide-wire in and hold it.

516
00:20:26,567 --> 00:20:29,354
Take your time, don't rush, get it right.

517
00:20:29,379 --> 00:20:31,055
Don't let go of it.

518
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:34,146
And, um... what if the wire slips?

519
00:20:34,171 --> 00:20:35,188
Why?

520
00:20:35,213 --> 00:20:37,063
Because it slipped.

521
00:20:37,088 --> 00:20:38,521
Slipped? Slipped where?

522
00:20:38,546 --> 00:20:40,076
Inside the patient.

523
00:20:40,101 --> 00:20:41,639
Schmitt!

524
00:20:41,664 --> 00:20:43,305
Okay, hold pressure over the wound

525
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:44,868
and do not let go whatsoever, okay?

526
00:20:44,893 --> 00:20:46,500
We need some help in here.
We need to move

527
00:20:46,525 --> 00:20:48,132
the patient to the cath lab right now.

528
00:20:48,157 --> 00:20:49,625
- Oh, my God. Ah.
- Let me see.

529
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:51,107
I-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

530
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:57,931
You dropped a guide wire
into your patient, DeLuca?

531
00:20:57,956 --> 00:21:00,501
It landed in the right atrium.
It's under control now.

532
00:21:00,526 --> 00:21:02,792
And you didn't feel the need
to call me immediately?

533
00:21:02,817 --> 00:21:05,257
By the time I asked permission,
he could have been dead already.

534
00:21:05,282 --> 00:21:06,983
Would that have been better? Snare.

535
00:21:07,008 --> 00:21:08,452
Get that wire out of that man's body,

536
00:21:08,477 --> 00:21:10,674
and then I want a detailed
report on my desk.

537
00:21:10,699 --> 00:21:12,237
Understood. Won't happen again.

538
00:21:15,179 --> 00:21:16,647
Does she think you did this?

539
00:21:19,068 --> 00:21:22,202
So, the knife nicked
the brachiocephalic artery,

540
00:21:22,227 --> 00:21:24,493
but it's this dissection here
that I'm worried about.

541
00:21:24,518 --> 00:21:26,820
Oh, that's terrible, and beautiful.

542
00:21:26,845 --> 00:21:28,626
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

543
00:21:28,651 --> 00:21:30,189
We had a similar injury in Germany.

544
00:21:30,214 --> 00:21:31,994
Factory accident, but the same idea.

545
00:21:32,019 --> 00:21:34,910
We put a filter in
with endovascular access

546
00:21:34,935 --> 00:21:36,855
to prevent distal embolization,

547
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,424
and then we put a stent graft
over the dissection.

548
00:21:39,449 --> 00:21:41,924
We had a good outcome.

549
00:21:44,866 --> 00:21:46,682
What?

550
00:21:46,707 --> 00:21:47,827
Nothing.

551
00:21:49,172 --> 00:21:50,848
Uh...

552
00:21:50,873 --> 00:21:52,236
Do you have to go?

553
00:21:52,261 --> 00:21:53,660
It's just Koracick.

554
00:21:53,685 --> 00:21:55,361
I have a bunch of interns paging me

555
00:21:55,386 --> 00:21:57,341
when we're on the same floor.

556
00:21:57,366 --> 00:22:00,246
Hey, do you want to help me
find a new hiding spot?

557
00:22:01,772 --> 00:22:03,726
How about the OR? Baby's first scalpel?

558
00:22:03,751 --> 00:22:05,069
- Yeah, let's do it.
- Yeah. Let's go.

559
00:22:06,529 --> 00:22:08,137
That was the third grade!

560
00:22:08,162 --> 00:22:09,560
And you still haven't changed.

561
00:22:09,585 --> 00:22:10,948
- Still?
- Still.

562
00:22:10,973 --> 00:22:13,275
Why? Why am I surprised

563
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,081
that you don't care about Heather's soul,

564
00:22:15,106 --> 00:22:16,990
seeing as you don't have one yourself?

565
00:22:17,015 --> 00:22:18,726
- That's ridiculous.
- All right, look, enough.

566
00:22:18,751 --> 00:22:20,346
Stop it. That's enough!

567
00:22:21,435 --> 00:22:23,354
This arguing isn't doing anyone any good,

568
00:22:23,379 --> 00:22:26,341
and it certainly isn't doing
your sister any good.

569
00:22:26,366 --> 00:22:29,431
Now, you can bicker for the rest
of your lives as far I care,

570
00:22:29,456 --> 00:22:32,869
but in this moment, she needs you.

571
00:22:32,894 --> 00:22:34,744
So, pull yourselves together.

572
00:22:36,019 --> 00:22:37,660
He sounds like Mom.

573
00:22:37,685 --> 00:22:39,257
Right?

574
00:22:39,282 --> 00:22:44,119
But he's right.
We need to focus on Heather.

575
00:22:44,722 --> 00:22:46,557
She is...

576
00:22:47,303 --> 00:22:50,542
She was so full of life.

577
00:22:50,567 --> 00:22:52,869
She would not want to live like this.

578
00:22:52,894 --> 00:22:55,126
I don't want to abandon her.

579
00:22:55,151 --> 00:22:58,291
And I don't want her to abandon us.

580
00:22:58,291 --> 00:23:00,488
I mean, sh... sh... she's so young,

581
00:23:00,513 --> 00:23:02,016
and... and she's been through so much.

582
00:23:02,041 --> 00:23:05,280
I just don't... I don't
want her to... to die.

583
00:23:05,305 --> 00:23:07,703
No one should have to do
what you're doing.

584
00:23:08,708 --> 00:23:11,079
But you do have each other now,

585
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:13,300
and if you make this decision together,

586
00:23:13,325 --> 00:23:17,085
at... at least you'll find some healing.

587
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:20,697
At least your sister will have
given you back to each other.

588
00:23:23,118 --> 00:23:24,169
He's right.

589
00:23:25,479 --> 00:23:27,108
She is not here anymore.

590
00:23:28,295 --> 00:23:29,381
Are you sure?

591
00:23:29,406 --> 00:23:30,700
Yeah.

592
00:23:30,725 --> 00:23:34,693
Um... there's some paperwork to fill out,

593
00:23:34,718 --> 00:23:36,899
and then we can proceed.

594
00:23:37,427 --> 00:23:39,084
Until then, um...

595
00:23:39,109 --> 00:23:40,855
I think you should say your goodbyes.

596
00:23:49,804 --> 00:23:51,480
Okay.

597
00:23:52,663 --> 00:23:54,235
Good separation of the lobes.

598
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,833
How's your view, Dr. Grey?

599
00:23:55,858 --> 00:23:57,950
Worry about Karev's view, Qadri.

600
00:23:57,975 --> 00:24:00,104
Okay. We finished dividing the liver.

601
00:24:00,129 --> 00:24:02,395
Okay, so now you're down to the IVC.

602
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:03,645
So, you need to...

603
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:05,972
Check the dissection plane
for hemostasis?

604
00:24:05,997 --> 00:24:06,979
Yep, got it.

605
00:24:07,004 --> 00:24:10,451
Lap pads. Irrigation, suction.

606
00:24:10,476 --> 00:24:12,118
What happened?

607
00:24:12,143 --> 00:24:14,687
Uh... I'm not sure. Suction.

608
00:24:15,928 --> 00:24:18,026
It could be the liver
parenchyma, but I can't see.

609
00:24:18,051 --> 00:24:20,908
Is that just blood?
Is it arterial or venous?

610
00:24:20,933 --> 00:24:22,574
I'm looking. It looks venous.

611
00:24:22,599 --> 00:24:25,049
I mean, it's probably the middle
hepatic vein or the IVC.

612
00:24:25,074 --> 00:24:27,550
- Did you nick one of them?
- No. Suction.

613
00:24:27,575 --> 00:24:29,771
I mean, it could be backflow
from portal hypertension,

614
00:24:29,796 --> 00:24:30,883
but I can't see.

615
00:24:30,908 --> 00:24:32,515
BP's dropping. Hanging another unit.

616
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:33,522
I'm scrubbing in.

617
00:24:33,547 --> 00:24:34,768
Can you identify your landmarks?

618
00:24:34,769 --> 00:24:36,271
She's losing a lot of blood.

619
00:24:36,296 --> 00:24:38,412
I need to see. I just need to see.

620
00:24:41,817 --> 00:24:43,146
- Vascular exclusion.
- Vascular exclusion.

621
00:24:43,171 --> 00:24:45,403
We need to clamp the IVC
above and below the liver,

622
00:24:45,428 --> 00:24:47,626
cut off the blood supply,
and stop the bleeding.

623
00:24:47,651 --> 00:24:49,465
- Clamp.
- Wait. Have you ever done that before?

624
00:24:49,465 --> 00:24:50,412
It could kill her.

625
00:24:50,437 --> 00:24:52,391
Qadri, shut up or get out.

626
00:24:56,027 --> 00:24:57,148
I don't know.

627
00:24:57,173 --> 00:24:59,475
Seems to me you'd be
better off without him.

628
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,141
Just put him out of your mind.

629
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:02,704
Yeah.

630
00:25:02,729 --> 00:25:05,794
Any tips on how to do that?

631
00:25:06,113 --> 00:25:07,985
Just give it a few decades.

632
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:09,408
Bird!

633
00:25:10,923 --> 00:25:12,461
Bird?

634
00:25:12,486 --> 00:25:15,539
I'm sorry. Ms. Oh
is a little disoriented.

635
00:25:15,885 --> 00:25:18,360
Soyoung, is that you?

636
00:25:18,385 --> 00:25:19,960
Bird!

637
00:25:20,406 --> 00:25:22,395
You two know each other?

638
00:25:22,867 --> 00:25:25,799
This is the first woman I ever loved.

639
00:25:27,357 --> 00:25:29,033
Soyoung.

640
00:25:29,058 --> 00:25:31,383
Oh!

641
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:34,521
Does this always take so long?

642
00:25:34,546 --> 00:25:35,806
Can't rush perfection.

643
00:25:38,687 --> 00:25:42,298
So... am I first woman you've
dated who's stronger than you?

644
00:25:45,118 --> 00:25:46,169
Stronger?

645
00:25:46,194 --> 00:25:47,280
- Yeah.
- Really?

646
00:25:47,305 --> 00:25:49,086
Yeah, you're strong, sure, but...

647
00:25:49,111 --> 00:25:50,926
Oh, so, you can carry a 200-pound guy

648
00:25:50,951 --> 00:25:52,489
down six flights of stairs?

649
00:25:52,514 --> 00:25:55,266
I mean... I can probably knock out four.

650
00:26:00,465 --> 00:26:03,614
You know, my training

651
00:26:03,639 --> 00:26:10,420
is to zero in on the smallest,
most intimate detail,

652
00:26:10,445 --> 00:26:13,788
making sure to give it
all the attention it deserves,

653
00:26:13,813 --> 00:26:18,267
really just making sure
that I'm taking care

654
00:26:18,292 --> 00:26:23,151
of every last inch of my patient's needs.

655
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:26,176
So, um...

656
00:26:26,201 --> 00:26:29,371
while I may not have...

657
00:26:29,396 --> 00:26:33,224
...been trained to carry
a 200-pound man anywhere,

658
00:26:33,249 --> 00:26:35,551
I do have a great number of skills

659
00:26:35,576 --> 00:26:38,086
that I think you'll find come in handy.

660
00:26:38,111 --> 00:26:39,957
Mm-hmm.

661
00:26:40,618 --> 00:26:44,621
And just like that... we're done.

662
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:52,228
Mm.

663
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:54,688
- Maybe we should...
- Please don't say...

664
00:26:54,713 --> 00:26:55,765
Take it slow.

665
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:57,675
- You know?
- Yeah.

666
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,862
Yeah, we probably should.

667
00:27:05,652 --> 00:27:06,946
I think that's long enough.

668
00:27:06,971 --> 00:27:08,126
Yeah, me, too.

669
00:27:14,659 --> 00:27:17,212
I was stationed in Korea during the war.

670
00:27:18,487 --> 00:27:20,961
Every Sunday, I used to walk
into... into town

671
00:27:20,986 --> 00:27:23,948
to... to go to a specific odeng stand.

672
00:27:23,973 --> 00:27:25,268
Fish cake skewers.

673
00:27:25,293 --> 00:27:26,240
So good.

674
00:27:26,265 --> 00:27:27,803
Ooh.

675
00:27:27,828 --> 00:27:30,614
It was run by the most beautiful
woman I've ever seen.

676
00:27:30,639 --> 00:27:33,601
She didn't speak English,
and I didn't speak Korean,

677
00:27:33,626 --> 00:27:35,615
but we communicated by dictionary.

678
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:39,643
I-I-I taught her my name
by pointing to the word "bird."

679
00:27:39,668 --> 00:27:41,483
Bird!

680
00:27:43,835 --> 00:27:45,962
When I got word that I was shipping home,

681
00:27:45,987 --> 00:27:49,325
we... we made a plan to...
to meet at the train station.

682
00:27:51,295 --> 00:27:53,874
I-I was reassigned to an earlier train,

683
00:27:53,899 --> 00:27:56,131
and I-I had no way
of getting in touch with you.

684
00:27:56,156 --> 00:27:58,944
I-I-I c... I couldn't defy orders.

685
00:27:58,969 --> 00:28:01,339
So I went home alone.

686
00:28:01,364 --> 00:28:04,881
Eventually, I-I-I married
and had a family,

687
00:28:04,906 --> 00:28:06,305
but I never forgot you.

688
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:08,839
I never forgot you, Soyoung.

689
00:28:08,864 --> 00:28:11,270
I'm so sorry, Soyoung.

690
00:28:15,635 --> 00:28:18,701
Wow. I've never felt that way
about anyone.

691
00:28:18,726 --> 00:28:21,374
I'm hormonal.

692
00:28:21,399 --> 00:28:23,043
I'm feeling that way about everyone.

693
00:28:29,965 --> 00:28:31,884
She said she didn't show up
to the train station, either.

694
00:28:31,909 --> 00:28:33,481
She was too scared to leave her country.

695
00:28:37,486 --> 00:28:39,592
What do you know?

696
00:28:44,312 --> 00:28:46,126
But I thought about you ever since.

697
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:53,888
"I found you online,

698
00:28:53,913 --> 00:28:55,555
and when you posted about your surgery,

699
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:58,576
I bought a plane ticket
and tried to come and find you."

700
00:29:07,872 --> 00:29:09,271
"But I didn't tell my family

701
00:29:09,296 --> 00:29:10,694
in fear that they would stop me."

702
00:29:21,761 --> 00:29:24,340
"I don't know what will happen
in the next life,

703
00:29:24,365 --> 00:29:25,737
but I didn't want to leave this one

704
00:29:25,762 --> 00:29:27,427
without seeing you again."

705
00:29:37,555 --> 00:29:38,815
Okay, no PVCs,

706
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,760
and his blood pressure seems
to be responding well

707
00:29:40,785 --> 00:29:42,276
to the IV fluids.

708
00:29:42,301 --> 00:29:43,594
Why didn't you tell Bailey it was me?

709
00:29:43,619 --> 00:29:45,019
Please. She already knew.

710
00:29:45,044 --> 00:29:47,761
So, what? She just likes
yelling at you, or...?

711
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:50,480
Schmitt, I was in charge,
and what happens on my watch

712
00:29:50,505 --> 00:29:51,730
is my responsibility,

713
00:29:51,755 --> 00:29:54,230
even colossal screw-ups
I would never make.

714
00:29:55,922 --> 00:29:58,397
This is a guide wire,

715
00:29:58,422 --> 00:30:00,828
what almost killed our patient today

716
00:30:00,853 --> 00:30:02,142
because you couldn't hold onto it.

717
00:30:02,167 --> 00:30:03,531
So, you know what you're gonna do?

718
00:30:03,556 --> 00:30:05,129
You're gonna hold onto it.

719
00:30:05,154 --> 00:30:06,587
For a week.

720
00:30:06,612 --> 00:30:08,254
It's going with you everywhere...

721
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:10,233
on rounds, while you sleep,
while you eat.

722
00:30:10,258 --> 00:30:11,966
And hopefully, it'll put you
in the simple habit

723
00:30:11,966 --> 00:30:14,129
of not letting go of it.

724
00:30:14,154 --> 00:30:16,004
Oh, God. It's his daughter.

725
00:30:16,029 --> 00:30:17,774
Do we tell her?

726
00:30:17,799 --> 00:30:19,823
No, you're telling her.

727
00:30:19,848 --> 00:30:21,837
What? I thought it was
your responsibility.

728
00:30:21,862 --> 00:30:23,886
Yeah, with Bailey. This is all you.

729
00:30:26,862 --> 00:30:28,769
Oh... Oh, God.

730
00:30:30,924 --> 00:30:32,427
Suction.

731
00:30:32,452 --> 00:30:35,310
C'mon. C'mon. C'mon.

732
00:30:37,278 --> 00:30:39,631
Okay. Middle hepatic vein repaired.

733
00:30:39,631 --> 00:30:40,960
Keep her on norepi drip.

734
00:30:40,985 --> 00:30:43,321
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon.

735
00:30:43,346 --> 00:30:44,745
Clamps off.

736
00:30:49,631 --> 00:30:51,367
Blood flow restored.

737
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:52,687
Whew!

738
00:30:52,712 --> 00:30:54,978
Okay, now, so,
for the right lobe, you need...

739
00:30:55,003 --> 00:30:56,923
Hemostatic sheets.

740
00:30:56,948 --> 00:30:57,965
Thank you.

741
00:31:02,156 --> 00:31:03,485
M.A.P.s stable.

742
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:07,930
Great. Great.
Okay, next, I have to, uh...

743
00:31:07,955 --> 00:31:09,457
Next, we, uh...

744
00:31:09,482 --> 00:31:10,569
Next...

745
00:31:10,594 --> 00:31:12,131
There is no next.

746
00:31:12,156 --> 00:31:14,631
You just completed your first
successful Stage 1

747
00:31:14,656 --> 00:31:16,471
of an ALPPS procedure...

748
00:31:16,496 --> 00:31:18,103
...during your first week
as an attending.

749
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,392
Okay, okay. We're not done yet.

750
00:31:22,417 --> 00:31:23,399
Drains, please.

751
00:31:23,424 --> 00:31:24,615
Congratulations, Karev.

752
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,003
We don't need Dr. Grey for this.

753
00:31:26,028 --> 00:31:27,531
Great work, Kare...

754
00:31:33,859 --> 00:31:37,723
First, I'm going to disconnect
the supportive medication.

755
00:31:40,213 --> 00:31:44,425
But I will continue the meds
that keep her comfortable.

756
00:31:53,642 --> 00:31:56,846
Now I'm going to disconnect the vent,

757
00:31:56,871 --> 00:31:59,404
and then, she'll be gone.

758
00:32:03,808 --> 00:32:05,171
We love you, Heather.

759
00:32:05,196 --> 00:32:07,810
You're gonna see a light. Walk toward it.

760
00:32:07,835 --> 00:32:09,870
Walk toward the warm light.

761
00:32:34,669 --> 00:32:36,345
Ah!

762
00:32:40,016 --> 00:32:42,769
Oh. It's her friend Ashley.

763
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:43,984
Send it to voicemail.

764
00:32:46,466 --> 00:32:48,451
Ashley, hey.

765
00:32:48,476 --> 00:32:49,667
It's Heidi.

766
00:32:53,201 --> 00:32:54,635
- What?
- What's wrong?

767
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:55,884
It's Heather.

768
00:32:55,909 --> 00:32:57,620
Oh! Oh, my God! It's Heather!

769
00:32:57,645 --> 00:32:58,905
Wait, like her spirit?

770
00:32:58,930 --> 00:33:00,467
Oh, my God. What is she saying?

771
00:33:00,492 --> 00:33:02,293
No, she's alive! She's not dead.

772
00:33:02,318 --> 00:33:03,982
Somebody stole her bag.

773
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,395
Ah!

774
00:33:06,788 --> 00:33:09,111
Who... Who is this woman?
Who is this woman?

775
00:33:09,136 --> 00:33:11,229
I don't know. I don't know.

776
00:33:11,254 --> 00:33:13,517
You plug her back in! Plug her back in!

777
00:33:13,542 --> 00:33:15,114
Well, it's a little too late for that.

778
00:33:15,139 --> 00:33:16,915
Don't go toward the light!

779
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:19,553
Do not go toward the light!

780
00:33:19,578 --> 00:33:20,804
Stop yelling at her.

781
00:33:20,829 --> 00:33:22,910
Oh, my God.

782
00:33:26,542 --> 00:33:28,184
They haven't seen each other in 60 years?

783
00:33:28,209 --> 00:33:32,490
Yeah. But to look at them,
it's like it was yesterday.

784
00:33:33,161 --> 00:33:35,858
They had something good,

785
00:33:35,883 --> 00:33:38,357
and then they let it go
because it scared them,

786
00:33:38,382 --> 00:33:41,066
and then they spent the next
six decades regretting it.

787
00:33:42,723 --> 00:33:44,261
That's a lot of regret.

788
00:33:44,286 --> 00:33:47,342
I'm happy with our decision...

789
00:33:47,367 --> 00:33:49,594
but it scares me.

790
00:33:51,056 --> 00:33:53,878
And telling people
is just gonna make it more real

791
00:33:53,903 --> 00:33:56,158
and scarier.

792
00:33:58,209 --> 00:34:00,083
But it's still a good thing.

793
00:34:01,434 --> 00:34:04,325
I want to tell my family and my friends.

794
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:05,945
I want to share this good.

795
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:11,032
And I want you to do it with me.

796
00:34:12,117 --> 00:34:13,910
I mean...

797
00:34:15,778 --> 00:34:17,143
I guess.

798
00:34:22,827 --> 00:34:24,989
So, the injured woman
stole the sister's wallet?

799
00:34:25,014 --> 00:34:26,413
And was misidentified.

800
00:34:26,438 --> 00:34:28,010
I knew we shouldn't unplug her.

801
00:34:28,035 --> 00:34:30,125
Oh, no. Don't put this on me.

802
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:32,347
- We agreed to unplug...
- Eh, no, no, no, no.

803
00:34:32,372 --> 00:34:34,152
You're not gonna start this again.

804
00:34:34,177 --> 00:34:36,167
This doesn't happen every day,

805
00:34:36,192 --> 00:34:38,528
and it doesn't happen for no reason.

806
00:34:38,553 --> 00:34:39,986
So, instead of... bickering,

807
00:34:40,011 --> 00:34:42,486
you should thank God
you're all still alive

808
00:34:42,511 --> 00:34:44,396
and have another shot at life

809
00:34:44,421 --> 00:34:46,826
and at... at forgiveness

810
00:34:46,851 --> 00:34:49,118
and... and at sisterhood.

811
00:34:49,143 --> 00:34:51,514
Don't... Don't... Don't...
Don't waste this.

812
00:34:53,518 --> 00:34:55,229
Go find Heather and...

813
00:34:55,254 --> 00:34:57,721
and make up, for God's sake.

814
00:35:00,254 --> 00:35:02,139
Mm.

815
00:35:02,164 --> 00:35:03,875
Oh, come on, you know he's only worried

816
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:05,716
we're gonna sue him
for emotional distress.

817
00:35:05,741 --> 00:35:08,250
Okay. Let's go. We're walking.

818
00:35:09,838 --> 00:35:12,034
Every time I think this place
might be turning around...

819
00:35:15,671 --> 00:35:16,966
Where are you going?

820
00:35:18,587 --> 00:35:21,133
I'm gonna call my wife.

821
00:35:21,158 --> 00:35:22,938
This is a chief problem.

822
00:35:31,612 --> 00:35:34,052
But I don't understand
what you mean by "dropped it."

823
00:35:34,077 --> 00:35:35,510
How do you drop a guide wire?

824
00:35:35,535 --> 00:35:37,160
Because I screw things up.
It's what I do.

825
00:35:37,161 --> 00:35:39,393
Don't do that. Don't dismiss yourself.

826
00:35:39,418 --> 00:35:42,170
I know, I know.
I should be... more positive.

827
00:35:42,195 --> 00:35:43,734
No, no, that is not what I mean.

828
00:35:43,759 --> 00:35:47,032
I mean... demand more
from yourself, Levi.

829
00:35:48,515 --> 00:35:49,948
Come on.

830
00:35:49,973 --> 00:35:51,511
Where are we going?

831
00:35:51,536 --> 00:35:52,795
Skills lab.

832
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:55,018
You're gonna thread that wire
through a simulator

833
00:35:55,043 --> 00:35:57,310
at least a hundred times
without messing it up.

834
00:35:57,335 --> 00:35:58,629
What kind of boyfriend are you?

835
00:35:58,654 --> 00:36:00,435
The kind that doesn't
want to date someone

836
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:02,171
who can't do a central line.

837
00:36:02,196 --> 00:36:03,838
All right? We'll order some pizza,

838
00:36:03,863 --> 00:36:05,812
and we're not gonna leave
until you get it right, okay?

839
00:36:07,121 --> 00:36:08,243
You're staying with me?

840
00:36:08,268 --> 00:36:10,221
Well, yeah. I'm not dead inside.

841
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:17,708
I'm just gonna...

842
00:36:17,733 --> 00:36:18,767
Okay, fine.

843
00:36:18,865 --> 00:36:20,890
Oh! Damn it!

844
00:36:26,395 --> 00:36:27,516
Hey, Dr. Pierce.

845
00:36:28,653 --> 00:36:29,773
- Hi.
- Hey.

846
00:36:29,798 --> 00:36:33,002
Dr. Hughes... I mean, um, Officer Hughes?

847
00:36:33,027 --> 00:36:34,218
Agent? Agent?

848
00:36:34,243 --> 00:36:36,475
"Hughes" is fine.
Um, or you can call me Vic.

849
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,558
Right. Vic.

850
00:36:39,211 --> 00:36:41,269
Hello.

851
00:36:41,294 --> 00:36:46,304
Um, so, I, uh,
I don't want this to be awkward.

852
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:48,455
It's not. It's not awkward.

853
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,636
Okay, it seems like it is.

854
00:36:49,661 --> 00:36:51,232
Uh... no. It's...

855
00:36:51,257 --> 00:36:52,528
Uh...

856
00:36:52,553 --> 00:36:54,715
Some people just move on
faster than others.

857
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:56,973
Wow. Well, to be fair, my guy died.

858
00:36:56,998 --> 00:36:58,744
You were there.

859
00:36:58,769 --> 00:37:00,223
- Oh, God. No, not that.
- Yeah.

860
00:37:00,248 --> 00:37:02,342
Not you. I mean Jackson.

861
00:37:02,367 --> 00:37:04,806
Uh, forget it.

862
00:37:08,338 --> 00:37:10,223
It's... It's... It's not awkward.

863
00:37:10,248 --> 00:37:11,855
Okay.

864
00:37:23,061 --> 00:37:24,910
Oh, no. Uh, there are places for that,

865
00:37:24,935 --> 00:37:26,439
and this isn't one of them.

866
00:37:26,464 --> 00:37:29,022
Meredith Grey 3-D printed portal veins

867
00:37:29,488 --> 00:37:31,200
as a second-year attending.

868
00:37:31,225 --> 00:37:33,457
I know this because I read
an article about it one night

869
00:37:33,482 --> 00:37:35,227
in my college dorm
while my friends were out

870
00:37:35,252 --> 00:37:36,651
playing beer pong and sleeping around.

871
00:37:36,676 --> 00:37:39,243
I put everything into matching here.

872
00:37:40,830 --> 00:37:43,062
And to working with her.
And you fired her.

873
00:37:43,087 --> 00:37:47,889
Qadri, you just saw a gifted attending

874
00:37:47,914 --> 00:37:51,673
perform an extremely rare and
technically difficult procedure,

875
00:37:51,698 --> 00:37:53,673
and all you can think
about is Meredith Grey?

876
00:37:53,698 --> 00:37:55,097
Do you know how many other residents

877
00:37:55,122 --> 00:37:57,041
asked to be on that case today?

878
00:37:57,066 --> 00:38:00,061
Fine. You want to count residents?

879
00:38:00,086 --> 00:38:03,674
Guess how many residents came
here to work with Meredith Grey!

880
00:38:03,699 --> 00:38:07,994
We didn't come here for
Dr. Koracick or Karev or Avery.

881
00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:09,889
Dr. Bailey, we didn't come here for you.

882
00:38:09,914 --> 00:38:11,868
We all had our choice in programs,

883
00:38:11,893 --> 00:38:13,778
but we picked this one.

884
00:38:13,803 --> 00:38:16,173
I picked this one,

885
00:38:16,198 --> 00:38:19,334
and it wasn't to watch
Meredith Grey on a TV screen!

886
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:20,966
Oh, you know what?

887
00:38:20,991 --> 00:38:22,270
Oh, you're right.

888
00:38:22,295 --> 00:38:24,007
Yeah, you shouldn't
have to work like that.

889
00:38:24,008 --> 00:38:27,235
So, let's fix it. Work somewhere else.

890
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:29,643
What?

891
00:38:29,668 --> 00:38:31,969
You're fired, Dr. Qadri.

892
00:38:31,993 --> 00:38:35,371
Uh, now you and your hero
have something in common.

893
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:36,830
We do our best

894
00:38:36,855 --> 00:38:39,712
to reunite the healthy cells and tissue,

895
00:38:39,737 --> 00:38:41,795
and if we do our jobs right,

896
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,948
there's another kind of reunion...

897
00:38:43,973 --> 00:38:46,309
the patients and their families,

898
00:38:46,334 --> 00:38:48,096
their loved ones,

899
00:38:48,121 --> 00:38:49,242
their lives.

900
00:38:49,267 --> 00:38:51,760
And you see all this?

901
00:38:51,785 --> 00:38:56,934
This is where we get to do
some really cool stuff.

902
00:38:56,959 --> 00:39:02,837
Like stick our hands in bodies
and sew up stab wounds.

903
00:39:04,529 --> 00:39:07,525
I know she can't understand me,
but I still like telling her.

904
00:39:10,994 --> 00:39:15,828
Wow. Time has really flown by.
Um... I should go.

905
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:17,078
I think you should stay.

906
00:39:17,103 --> 00:39:18,293
If I don't get her down,

907
00:39:18,318 --> 00:39:20,237
she is gonna be a nightmare
in the morning.

908
00:39:20,262 --> 00:39:23,257
No, no, no, Teddy. I think you
should stay at work, okay?

909
00:39:23,282 --> 00:39:24,472
Come back.

910
00:39:24,497 --> 00:39:26,973
I'll stay home with Allison for a while.

911
00:39:26,998 --> 00:39:28,153
- No.
- Why not?

912
00:39:28,178 --> 00:39:29,542
Because I'm not a failure.

913
00:39:29,892 --> 00:39:32,667
I know that I am doing a terrible job,

914
00:39:32,692 --> 00:39:34,091
but I will figure it out.

915
00:39:34,116 --> 00:39:35,202
You're not failing.

916
00:39:35,227 --> 00:39:37,458
I think you're just,
you know... doing it wrong.

917
00:39:37,483 --> 00:39:39,160
That's called failing.

918
00:39:39,185 --> 00:39:41,938
Teddy, you've been happier today

919
00:39:41,963 --> 00:39:44,890
than you've been
since she was born, you know?

920
00:39:44,915 --> 00:39:46,556
You love it here,

921
00:39:46,581 --> 00:39:49,195
and a happy mom is a better mom,
so just do this.

922
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,618
We're all gonna be better off.

923
00:39:50,643 --> 00:39:52,771
You really want to stay at home with her?

924
00:39:52,796 --> 00:39:54,889
'Cause anything beats
playing hide and seek

925
00:39:54,914 --> 00:39:55,931
with that Koracick.

926
00:39:55,956 --> 00:39:57,008
I really hate that guy.

927
00:39:59,498 --> 00:40:01,105
Okay.

928
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:03,443
- Mm-hmm.
- I'll go change. Be back.

929
00:40:03,468 --> 00:40:04,902
Wait. What? You're starting now?

930
00:40:04,927 --> 00:40:06,394
Yeah, I'm starting now.

931
00:40:06,419 --> 00:40:08,027
- Okay.
- Oh.

932
00:40:09,302 --> 00:40:11,534
But those reunions can get tricky, too.

933
00:40:12,984 --> 00:40:15,394
I-I wish I could've... I wish
I could've filmed Schmitt

934
00:40:15,419 --> 00:40:16,783
telling this guy's daughter, honestly.

935
00:40:16,808 --> 00:40:18,450
He gets all serious, and he asks her

936
00:40:18,475 --> 00:40:20,997
if she's ever heard of Sven Seldinger.

937
00:40:21,022 --> 00:40:22,385
Who?

938
00:40:22,410 --> 00:40:25,372
He invented the guide wire,
apparently, in the 1950s.

939
00:40:25,397 --> 00:40:27,385
Then he proceeds to explain

940
00:40:27,410 --> 00:40:29,573
how the process should have worked.

941
00:40:29,598 --> 00:40:31,414
I wanted to let him keep going,

942
00:40:31,439 --> 00:40:33,254
but, I mean, I had to put
this woman out of her misery.

943
00:40:33,279 --> 00:40:36,031
Oh. Still beats my day.

944
00:40:36,056 --> 00:40:38,740
I would have literally climbed
through the phone

945
00:40:38,765 --> 00:40:40,511
into that OR if I could have.

946
00:40:40,536 --> 00:40:42,525
Instead, Bailey just hung up on me.

947
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:44,260
And then I had to deal with a beehive

948
00:40:44,285 --> 00:40:45,510
in a discarded toilet.

949
00:40:45,535 --> 00:40:47,212
Link and I are having a baby.

950
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:50,008
What?

951
00:40:50,033 --> 00:40:54,976
Yeah. It's, uh, exciting and
scary and, uh, maybe a mistake.

952
00:40:55,001 --> 00:40:57,372
I'm sure you have an opinion,
but, uh, I... we... I just...

953
00:40:57,397 --> 00:40:59,941
w-we... wanted you to know.

954
00:40:59,966 --> 00:41:02,545
If you had troubles
before going into the OR,

955
00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:05,184
they won't magically go away
now that you're healed.

956
00:41:05,209 --> 00:41:06,816
Wow!

957
00:41:06,841 --> 00:41:08,309
Move over!

958
00:41:08,350 --> 00:41:09,610
Oh, y-you're happy.

959
00:41:09,635 --> 00:41:11,997
Yes, of course I'm happy.
I'm gonna be an auntie.

960
00:41:12,022 --> 00:41:14,532
Auntie Mer.

961
00:41:14,557 --> 00:41:17,899
I just... I didn't...
I had no idea that...

962
00:41:17,924 --> 00:41:20,157
the two of you were even so serious.

963
00:41:20,182 --> 00:41:21,510
Neither did we.

964
00:41:21,535 --> 00:41:23,074
Some things will get better...

965
00:41:24,955 --> 00:41:27,603
This is Catherine Fox.
Please leave a message.

966
00:41:27,628 --> 00:41:28,979
...others could get worse.

967
00:41:29,004 --> 00:41:30,263
And how was your day?

968
00:41:30,288 --> 00:41:32,728
Uh, I've had better.

969
00:41:32,753 --> 00:41:34,534
Couldn't have been any worse
than that doctor

970
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:36,339
that pulled the plug
on the wrong patient.

971
00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:39,952
Was that you?

972
00:41:39,977 --> 00:41:44,026
Oh, I'm gonna need details.

973
00:41:44,051 --> 00:41:46,386
How about over dinner?

974
00:41:46,411 --> 00:41:48,470
Because when you let your guard down...

975
00:41:51,450 --> 00:41:52,814
Sure. Why not?

976
00:41:54,784 --> 00:41:57,778
...you're a lot more likely
to go down a dangerous path.
