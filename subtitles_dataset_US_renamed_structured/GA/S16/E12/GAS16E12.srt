1
00:00:05,379 --> 00:00:07,566
<i>The human body
is a terrible liar.</i>

2
00:00:07,732 --> 00:00:09,581
<i>Whatever secrets
it's keeping,</i>

3
00:00:10,003 --> 00:00:12,340
<i>it will tell them all
eventually.</i>

4
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:15,065
You back at work?

5
00:00:15,893 --> 00:00:17,668
- No.
- You gonna be?

6
00:00:18,035 --> 00:00:19,528
I had to meet with
Koracick to ask.

7
00:00:19,616 --> 00:00:20,871
He's not sure.

8
00:00:20,967 --> 00:00:22,675
Yeah, well,
I guess it was pretty sudden.

9
00:00:22,763 --> 00:00:24,308
You did kinda
screw him.

10
00:00:24,597 --> 00:00:27,285
And we don't all have parents
who can clean up our messes.

11
00:00:28,981 --> 00:00:30,488
You coming tonight?

12
00:00:30,576 --> 00:00:31,863
Why wouldn't I be coming?

13
00:00:31,951 --> 00:00:33,731
Well, seeing as
you can't stand the sight of me,

14
00:00:33,818 --> 00:00:35,137
I thought
maybe you'd skip it.

15
00:00:35,558 --> 00:00:39,050
Jackson, my opinion of you
has no effect on my plans.

16
00:00:39,138 --> 00:00:40,552
It's Richard and Catherine's
anniversary.

17
00:00:40,639 --> 00:00:42,332
I care about them.
I'm going.

18
00:00:42,474 --> 00:00:44,793
And you're clearly
in the mood to celebrate,

19
00:00:44,904 --> 00:00:47,003
so,
that's great.

20
00:00:47,304 --> 00:00:50,898
<i>Leprosy, chicken pox,
tuberculosis, HIV...</i>

21
00:00:50,986 --> 00:00:54,166
We can carry these for years
with no physical symptoms.

22
00:00:55,948 --> 00:00:57,726
I'm sorry you drove
all the way out here,

23
00:00:57,814 --> 00:00:59,385
but my answer is no.

24
00:00:59,473 --> 00:01:01,096
This isn't only
your decision.

25
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:02,549
And this dinner
is ridiculous.

26
00:01:02,637 --> 00:01:04,090
We're giving them
big news.

27
00:01:04,178 --> 00:01:05,211
It affects us all.

28
00:01:05,299 --> 00:01:06,632
Yeah, so we should just
tell them.

29
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,057
Richard,
I care about Maggie.

30
00:01:08,145 --> 00:01:09,432
I know you care
about Jackson.

31
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,564
This dinner is for them,
not for us.

32
00:01:11,652 --> 00:01:12,877
We're still gonna
be a family,

33
00:01:12,965 --> 00:01:14,510
even if you and I
are separating.

34
00:01:14,598 --> 00:01:16,869
<i>But given enough time,
the signs will always show up.</i>

35
00:01:16,957 --> 00:01:19,197
Can't wait for this
damn night to be over.

36
00:01:19,285 --> 00:01:20,336
- Hey.
- Hi!

37
00:01:20,424 --> 00:01:21,742
- Hey!
- Hi, guys!

38
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:23,150
- Hi. Mwah.
- Hi.

39
00:01:23,238 --> 00:01:25,321
How you been? Mwah.

40
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,379
So, u-um,
all set for tonight?

41
00:01:28,434 --> 00:01:30,092
Hey, I'm making
blackberry cobbler.

42
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,024
Ooh, my favorite.

43
00:01:31,112 --> 00:01:32,323
Yum!

44
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:35,033
<i>The real question is,
what are your body's secrets?</i>

45
00:01:35,121 --> 00:01:38,002
So, um...
see you soon.

46
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,682
- Oh, I can't wait.
- Yeah, yeah.

47
00:01:39,778 --> 00:01:40,675
- Alright, see you tonight.
- Okay.

48
00:01:40,763 --> 00:01:41,828
Okay.
See you tonight.

49
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,471
<i>And are you ready to know?</i>

50
00:01:48,258 --> 00:01:50,463

52
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,947
I can reach
for my own water.

53
00:02:02,408 --> 00:02:04,613
The hospital just wants me
to rest a few more weeks.

54
00:02:04,701 --> 00:02:06,991
There's nothing wrong with me
helping you with that.

55
00:02:12,356 --> 00:02:15,059
Now that...
That makes me feel better.

56
00:02:15,155 --> 00:02:16,808
Is everybody decent?

57
00:02:16,895 --> 00:02:19,073
Except for the ball gag
and jock strap, we're good.

58
00:02:19,161 --> 00:02:20,704
- Levi.
- What was that, honey?

59
00:02:20,792 --> 00:02:21,955
What do you need, Mom?

60
00:02:22,043 --> 00:02:23,456
Cousin Shirl just called

61
00:02:23,544 --> 00:02:25,776
to say that Mayda heard
that Great Uncle Saul

62
00:02:25,864 --> 00:02:28,088
is circling the drain
over at Olympia Meadows...

63
00:02:28,176 --> 00:02:29,245
"Circling the drain"?

64
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:32,378
You couldn't say that like...
I don't know, like a person?

65
00:02:32,466 --> 00:02:34,329
If he had behaved
more like a person...

66
00:02:34,475 --> 00:02:36,243
Other than with you...
Then maybe.

67
00:02:36,331 --> 00:02:39,143
The point is,
he's in hospice,

68
00:02:39,231 --> 00:02:41,054
so if you want to see him,
then...

69
00:02:41,142 --> 00:02:42,549
Now?

70
00:02:43,158 --> 00:02:44,691
A-A-As in now-now?

71
00:02:44,779 --> 00:02:47,215
As in, try not to get a ticket
speeding on the interstate.

72
00:02:47,303 --> 00:02:48,636
That's up to you.

73
00:02:48,799 --> 00:02:49,885
Bring a sweater, honey.

74
00:02:49,973 --> 00:02:51,784
Those places
are like an icebox.

75
00:02:58,230 --> 00:02:59,565
You okay?

76
00:03:01,283 --> 00:03:04,495
Uncle Saul was an ass
to everyone else.

77
00:03:05,803 --> 00:03:07,018
I have no idea why,

78
00:03:07,106 --> 00:03:09,979
but it's like life gave him
45% of being a good man,

79
00:03:10,067 --> 00:03:11,948
and he spent it all
on me.

80
00:03:18,423 --> 00:03:20,290
Happy anniversary, guys.

81
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:22,540
Anniversary.
Um...

82
00:03:22,938 --> 00:03:25,721
I suppose it is
in a few days, isn't it?

83
00:03:25,809 --> 00:03:27,925
That's not why you invited us
over for dinner tonight?

84
00:03:28,012 --> 00:03:29,085
Not exactly.

85
00:03:29,173 --> 00:03:30,620
You know,
when you get to be our age,

86
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:32,417
you stop counting, dear.

87
00:03:32,505 --> 00:03:34,362
- Here, give me this coat.
- Yes. Here.

88
00:03:34,487 --> 00:03:37,174
So, um, a patient
turned me on to those.

89
00:03:37,262 --> 00:03:39,581
They are insane.
They're French.

90
00:03:39,731 --> 00:03:41,777
You shouldn't have. 
Really.

91
00:03:44,112 --> 00:03:45,966
- Is something wrong?
- Oh, no.

92
00:03:46,053 --> 00:03:46,966
- Of course not.
- Okay.

93
00:03:47,053 --> 00:03:48,161
Mm-hmm.

94
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:49,981
- Oh. Well...
- Oh.

95
00:03:50,069 --> 00:03:51,488
Alright.

96
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:55,675
Happy anniversary.

97
00:03:55,763 --> 00:03:57,579
Oh, thank you.

98
00:03:57,667 --> 00:03:58,784
Um, more gifts.

99
00:03:58,872 --> 00:04:00,073
- More... Wonderful.
- Jackson,

100
00:04:00,161 --> 00:04:01,971
- is this an Alice Mann?
- Yes, it is.

101
00:04:02,059 --> 00:04:03,230
She only printed three of those.

102
00:04:03,317 --> 00:04:04,731
Oh! Sorry I didn't have
time to get it gift-wrapped.

103
00:04:04,818 --> 00:04:06,433
I literally just got it back
from the framer,

104
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,977
and it took forever to get it
out of South Africa.

105
00:04:09,065 --> 00:04:10,885
Jackson,
you are just...

106
00:04:11,096 --> 00:04:12,471
- Mm.
- ..too much.

107
00:04:12,559 --> 00:04:14,352
South Africa.
Nice.

108
00:04:15,423 --> 00:04:17,018
Uh,
is that a problem?

109
00:04:17,106 --> 00:04:18,139
No, I just wish I'd known

110
00:04:18,227 --> 00:04:19,472
you were bringing
something so expensive.

111
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:20,762
I brought chocolates.

112
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:22,224
Oh, well,
who doesn't love chocolate?

113
00:04:22,311 --> 00:04:23,844
I love chocolate.

114
00:04:23,932 --> 00:04:25,961
Come on, Maggie.
Let's go have some chocolate.

115
00:04:31,071 --> 00:04:32,224
Don't like it?

116
00:04:32,312 --> 00:04:34,260
Oh, no, no.
It's beautiful.

117
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:36,305
Uh, she's mom's favorite,

118
00:04:36,393 --> 00:04:38,112
and I figured you guys have
similar taste.

119
00:04:38,294 --> 00:04:39,496
You know,
I could help you find a spot

120
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:41,369
- to hang it up if you want.
- Um, n-n-n-not yet.

121
00:04:41,456 --> 00:04:42,807
Um...

122
00:04:43,752 --> 00:04:46,229
- Come on in.
- Sure, yeah.

123
00:04:53,035 --> 00:04:55,596
Dinner should be
ready shortly.

124
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,250
Um, we wanted to
talk about...

125
00:04:58,338 --> 00:05:00,612
I wonder, who would like
a glass of wine?

126
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,443
- I know I surely do.
- Uh, heavy, please.

127
00:05:02,531 --> 00:05:03,968
- Me, please.
- Okay.

128
00:05:04,974 --> 00:05:06,010
Oh.

129
00:05:06,428 --> 00:05:10,385
So, Mom, they set an opening
for the hospital at Memphis?

130
00:05:10,473 --> 00:05:11,476
Early next month.

131
00:05:11,579 --> 00:05:12,902
So many hospitals.

132
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:14,903
I do not know how
you keep track of them all.

133
00:05:14,991 --> 00:05:16,194
By never being at home.

134
00:05:16,282 --> 00:05:20,503
By hiring good people
who help me run things.

135
00:05:20,675 --> 00:05:22,468
Tom Koracick excluded,
I guess.

136
00:05:22,574 --> 00:05:24,088
He's very good
at what he does.

137
00:05:24,176 --> 00:05:26,526
You know, now that
we are all together,

138
00:05:26,614 --> 00:05:28,488
- what we wanted to talk with you...
- I think that we could really wait

139
00:05:28,575 --> 00:05:30,721
until we've all
eaten, dear.

140
00:05:30,809 --> 00:05:33,807
I don't know
if it needs to wait, hon.

141
00:05:35,076 --> 00:05:36,659
What's wrong?

142
00:05:37,411 --> 00:05:39,245
- Did you get bad news?
- Oh, God no.

143
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:41,049
My scans
have come back great.

144
00:05:41,137 --> 00:05:43,417
Richard,
you're terrifying them.

145
00:05:45,014 --> 00:05:46,806
Oh, that must be Vic.

146
00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:48,432
Who's Vic?
His girlfriend.

147
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,370
I came from work,
so she's meeting me here.

148
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:52,291
- But why?
- Good question.

149
00:05:52,394 --> 00:05:54,477
You invited your girlfriend
to our dinner?

150
00:05:54,565 --> 00:05:55,924
More, the merrier, right?

151
00:05:59,683 --> 00:06:00,886
Hello!

152
00:06:00,973 --> 00:06:02,183
Hey.

153
00:06:03,025 --> 00:06:05,346
Uh, you need a ride
or something?

154
00:06:05,434 --> 00:06:06,471
Oh, no, I invited him.

155
00:06:06,559 --> 00:06:07,765
That's okay, right?

156
00:06:07,853 --> 00:06:09,082
You said it's a party.

157
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:10,389
Dinner... Dinner party.

158
00:06:10,477 --> 00:06:11,316
I said it was
a dinner

159
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:12,271
- party.
- Didn't hear that part.

160
00:06:12,367 --> 00:06:13,756
Mm-hmm.
What did you do?

161
00:06:14,076 --> 00:06:15,402
Come on in, man.
Don't worry about it.

162
00:06:15,489 --> 00:06:16,893
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Welcome.

163
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,093
Alright.

164
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:24,144
Dean Miller.
Pleasure to meet you.

165
00:06:24,232 --> 00:06:25,553
Richard Webber.
Pleasure's mine.

166
00:06:25,641 --> 00:06:27,055
- Please, please, have a seat.
- Hi.

167
00:06:27,142 --> 00:06:28,675
Richard,
I want you to meet Vic.

168
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:30,060
Oh, hello.

169
00:06:30,148 --> 00:06:31,131
It's so nice
to meet you.

170
00:06:31,219 --> 00:06:32,390
Jackson's told me
so much about you.

171
00:06:32,477 --> 00:06:35,240
And I'm sure Mom's told you
plenty about Vic.

172
00:06:35,448 --> 00:06:37,428
Oh, yes, yeah.
Right?

173
00:06:37,553 --> 00:06:38,636
Yes.

174
00:06:40,381 --> 00:06:43,748
So, this is a really small
dinner party, huh?

175
00:06:43,901 --> 00:06:46,350
Well, it's a good thing
I made plenty of food.

176
00:06:46,438 --> 00:06:47,681
Um, Richard,

177
00:06:47,769 --> 00:06:49,972
would you mind giving me a hand
in the kitchen?

178
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:51,940
- I was just about to ask.
- Mm.

179
00:06:58,005 --> 00:07:00,207
I, uh, feel like
we're crashing.

180
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:02,553
- No.
- Why would you think that?

181
00:07:03,302 --> 00:07:05,865
Well, you're not crashing...
At all, actually.

182
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,600
Let me go ahead
and grab you some wine.

183
00:07:08,272 --> 00:07:09,885
See if Maggie's
left us any.

184
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,045
Uncle Saul.

185
00:07:23,322 --> 00:07:27,395
Boy, do you look like
a steaming pile of crap, kid.

186
00:07:27,483 --> 00:07:29,212
Same to you,
Uncle Saul.

187
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,709
Thought you were
his favorite.

188
00:07:31,162 --> 00:07:33,053
Insults is how
we show love.

189
00:07:33,373 --> 00:07:35,545
I'm assuming you're Levi,
the doctor.

190
00:07:35,933 --> 00:07:37,488
I've heard
a lot about you.

191
00:07:37,576 --> 00:07:38,803
How is he?

192
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:40,675
He's in end-stage
heart failure,

193
00:07:40,763 --> 00:07:42,889
so we're doing our best
to keep him comfortable.

194
00:07:43,183 --> 00:07:45,926
Which, I've learned,
does not include

195
00:07:46,013 --> 00:07:48,596
an all-expense paid trip
to Maui.

196
00:07:48,683 --> 00:07:51,326
I'm afraid not,
Saul, no.

197
00:07:51,414 --> 00:07:52,965
I'll come back
to check on you later.

198
00:07:53,053 --> 00:07:54,420
Meh.

199
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:56,060
Thank you.

200
00:07:56,325 --> 00:07:58,309
- Boychick.
- Da.

201
00:08:00,205 --> 00:08:01,794
Mm.

202
00:08:02,605 --> 00:08:06,348
- We had Shabbat dinner last week...
- Ah.

203
00:08:06,568 --> 00:08:11,111
..and I snuck a few
hard-boiled eggs in my pocket,

204
00:08:11,206 --> 00:08:12,864
thinking you'd show up,

205
00:08:13,091 --> 00:08:15,278
but the nurse
sniffed 'em out

206
00:08:15,457 --> 00:08:17,000
and trashed 'em.

207
00:08:17,817 --> 00:08:19,950
He always knew
they were my favorite.

208
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:21,776
Where's Aunt Gertie?

209
00:08:22,052 --> 00:08:23,929
Eh, Gertie makes it
when she can.

210
00:08:24,017 --> 00:08:26,090
I tell her don't bother,
but she says,

211
00:08:26,209 --> 00:08:29,020
"That's what you do
for the man you love."

212
00:08:30,096 --> 00:08:33,174
Saul, this is Nico.
I wanted you to meet him...

213
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:34,885
What's this I hear
about you living

214
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:36,768
- in your mother's basement?
- Ugh.

215
00:08:36,856 --> 00:08:38,595
I thought you
were a hot-shot doctor.

216
00:08:38,736 --> 00:08:40,239
I was hoping that

217
00:08:40,327 --> 00:08:41,934
we would iron
a few things out

218
00:08:42,053 --> 00:08:43,731
before I just
up and left.

219
00:08:43,941 --> 00:08:45,630
I hate to move out
on bad terms.

220
00:08:45,718 --> 00:08:47,631
My nephew,
King of Vague.

221
00:08:47,719 --> 00:08:50,972
Spill. I don't have time
to play guessing games.

222
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:54,433
Mom learned some new
information about me,

223
00:08:54,524 --> 00:08:56,575
which was all
well and good

224
00:08:56,685 --> 00:08:58,434
as long as I kept it
in house.

225
00:08:58,522 --> 00:09:00,294
You think I'm getting
on a roof

226
00:09:00,393 --> 00:09:02,630
with a bugle horn
anytime soon?

227
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:04,622
Excellent point.

228
00:09:05,435 --> 00:09:07,848
Well, Uncle Saul.

229
00:09:08,795 --> 00:09:12,200
Nico here is
more than my friend.

230
00:09:12,581 --> 00:09:15,005
H-He's my boyfriend.

231
00:09:15,574 --> 00:09:20,309
And he has been
for a while now, and...

232
00:09:20,849 --> 00:09:21,889
I love him.

233
00:09:23,495 --> 00:09:25,528
It's an honor to
meet you, sir.

234
00:09:28,353 --> 00:09:30,806
Oh, God.
Dr. Marks!

235
00:09:44,378 --> 00:09:45,856
I killed him.

236
00:09:46,486 --> 00:09:48,239
I killed him
with my gayness.

237
00:09:54,991 --> 00:09:57,704
Did you know they were
bringing dates to dinner?

238
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:59,145
Of course not.

239
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,613
Well, we can't
tell them now.

240
00:10:00,701 --> 00:10:01,865
Yeah, well, if you'd have
listened to me,

241
00:10:01,952 --> 00:10:03,684
we'd have told them
without the fanfare.

242
00:10:03,772 --> 00:10:05,559
Well, it's too late
for that.

243
00:10:06,065 --> 00:10:07,575
We'll just
tell them later.

244
00:10:07,995 --> 00:10:11,184
Let's just get try to
get through tonight.

245
00:10:11,534 --> 00:10:13,052
Yep.

246
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:14,997
I've gotten good
at that.

247
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:25,677
Um, any... any, uh, good, like,
calls, uh, recently?

248
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:26,927
Something cool?

249
00:10:27,022 --> 00:10:31,325
Oh, there was a C.O.
buildup in the sewer yesterday.

250
00:10:31,591 --> 00:10:33,919
Shot some manhole covers
straight up in the air.

251
00:10:34,007 --> 00:10:37,135
It lifted 250 pounds of
cast iron like it was nothing.

252
00:10:37,223 --> 00:10:38,266
Wow.

253
00:10:38,353 --> 00:10:39,881
- Well, that is pretty cool.
- Yeah.

254
00:10:39,968 --> 00:10:42,221
I mean, it... it... it did
kill this woman's dad

255
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:44,958
while they were shopping
for her wedding dress.

256
00:10:45,385 --> 00:10:46,715
So, there's that.

257
00:10:48,075 --> 00:10:49,919
I'm gonna go add
some more place settings,

258
00:10:50,381 --> 00:10:52,384
since there's
so many more of us.

259
00:10:53,247 --> 00:10:54,950
You know what,
I should... I should help.

260
00:10:55,038 --> 00:10:56,072
I'll... I'll be
right back.

261
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:57,645
Okay.

262
00:11:01,724 --> 00:11:02,911
Cool party.

263
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:08,169
Should we grab a coffee?
Sandwich?

264
00:11:08,257 --> 00:11:10,183
- Your aunt may not be here for a while.
- I can't.

265
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:12,942
Jewish tradition says
a friend or family member

266
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:14,363
or designated shomer

267
00:11:14,581 --> 00:11:17,175
cannot leave the body
of a loved one unattended

268
00:11:17,263 --> 00:11:18,386
from the moment they die

269
00:11:18,473 --> 00:11:19,654
until they're buried
in the ground.

270
00:11:19,741 --> 00:11:21,880
Otherwise, their spirit
just sort of...

271
00:11:22,113 --> 00:11:24,856
like, lingers around,
confused.

272
00:11:24,994 --> 00:11:26,434
You're getting that
off the Internet?

273
00:11:27,136 --> 00:11:28,856
It's tradition.

274
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,673
And yes.

275
00:11:30,761 --> 00:11:32,934
I-I-I'm what they call
culturally Jewish.

276
00:11:33,093 --> 00:11:34,739
I, you know,
eat the bagels

277
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:36,272
and know
the five big prayers,

278
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,564
and went to first base with Shira
Levenstein at sleep-away camp.

279
00:11:38,651 --> 00:11:42,600
But this...
this I know.

280
00:11:43,022 --> 00:11:45,452
I am keeping Shemirah

281
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:48,823
until the Chevra Kaddisha arrive
or my Aunt Gertie

282
00:11:48,911 --> 00:11:52,202
or, you know,
literally anyone else.

283
00:11:53,768 --> 00:11:55,341
And now I want
a sandwich.

284
00:11:55,803 --> 00:11:57,056
Saul-y.

285
00:11:57,143 --> 00:11:58,886
I'm so sorry,
Aunt Gertie.

286
00:11:58,973 --> 00:12:01,143
I... Hey.

287
00:12:16,783 --> 00:12:19,170
You look good, my boy.
Really good.

288
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:23,373
I'm sorry you have to
see him this way.

289
00:12:23,461 --> 00:12:27,084
Gertie,
this is my f-friend Nico.

290
00:12:27,172 --> 00:12:28,172
Hi.

291
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:33,217
W-Why aren't they
taking his body?

292
00:12:33,995 --> 00:12:35,818
Apparently, it's been
a big day here,

293
00:12:35,936 --> 00:12:37,944
so I've been watching him.

294
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:40,031
But I understand that you'll
want to take over, so...

295
00:12:40,118 --> 00:12:41,118
Uh, I can't do that.

296
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:42,943
Saul-y and I promised

297
00:12:44,037 --> 00:12:46,936
that when the end
was the end,

298
00:12:47,566 --> 00:12:49,309
that was the end.

299
00:12:49,967 --> 00:12:51,303
The end of...?

300
00:12:56,334 --> 00:12:57,506
Hmm.

301
00:12:57,763 --> 00:12:59,346
He was a good man.

302
00:13:02,864 --> 00:13:04,657
Love you, buddy.

303
00:13:06,475 --> 00:13:10,420
And you are a good man, too,
you hear me?

304
00:13:11,865 --> 00:13:13,368
Um, are you going?

305
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:16,238
D-Does that mean I-I'm supposed
to just stay here, or...?

306
00:13:17,269 --> 00:13:18,397
Oh.

307
00:13:20,438 --> 00:13:22,754
Did you really think I wouldn't
see how obvious this is?

308
00:13:22,842 --> 00:13:23,803
How obvious what is?

309
00:13:23,891 --> 00:13:26,014
You trying to set me up.

310
00:13:26,653 --> 00:13:30,850
Like I need a date after you
made me the fifth wheel.

311
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:32,881
Not everyone is like you,
Jackson.

312
00:13:32,969 --> 00:13:35,444
She thought it was
a bigger party. That's why...

313
00:13:35,636 --> 00:13:37,016
I wasn't trying to
set you up.

314
00:13:39,295 --> 00:13:41,299
What is that supposed to mean...
"not everyone's like me"?

315
00:13:41,386 --> 00:13:42,969
Most people
take the time to grieve

316
00:13:43,057 --> 00:13:44,550
after the end
of a relationship

317
00:13:44,638 --> 00:13:46,841
before jumping into
the next one.

318
00:13:47,082 --> 00:13:49,715
Yeah.
I-I take time...

319
00:13:49,803 --> 00:13:51,556
Not after April.

320
00:13:52,099 --> 00:13:54,670
You guys had barely ended
when you and I got together.

321
00:13:54,758 --> 00:13:56,751
And we were still together
when you met Vic.

322
00:13:56,839 --> 00:13:59,212
You couldn't even go
on your nature walk

323
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:02,139
without getting entangled
with some woman named Kate.

324
00:14:02,973 --> 00:14:04,506
Why can't you be alone?

325
00:14:05,591 --> 00:14:07,292
I'm not doing this
with you right now.

326
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:08,803
Think whatever you want.

327
00:14:08,891 --> 00:14:10,844
I wasn't trying to
set you up, Maggie.

328
00:14:10,932 --> 00:14:12,515
I don't know why you'd even leap
to something like that

329
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:14,374
if you didn't think
the world revolved around you.

330
00:14:14,461 --> 00:14:15,459
I leapt to it

331
00:14:15,547 --> 00:14:17,616
because he has already
asked me out before.

332
00:14:17,959 --> 00:14:19,131
What?

333
00:14:19,506 --> 00:14:20,765
When? Recently?

334
00:14:20,853 --> 00:14:22,162
No. Months ago.

335
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:23,756
So, like,
when we were together?

336
00:14:23,844 --> 00:14:26,530
Yeah, while you were
on your nature walk-about,

337
00:14:26,618 --> 00:14:29,006
sending me
pictures of trees.

338
00:14:29,365 --> 00:14:31,725
Should I have
sent you a picture of him

339
00:14:31,927 --> 00:14:34,380
with that, like,
shrugging "why not?" emoji?

340
00:14:37,528 --> 00:14:40,108
Well, he's here now.

341
00:14:40,223 --> 00:14:42,556
We might as well
be hospitable.

342
00:14:44,195 --> 00:14:47,108
I don't think you got to worry
about Jackson and his ex.

343
00:14:47,264 --> 00:14:49,000
Unless you're worried about
them murdering each other.

344
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:50,410
Mm.

345
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:52,287
Well, that's good.

346
00:14:52,631 --> 00:14:54,635
You'll be all set up for your
second chance with her.

347
00:14:54,722 --> 00:14:56,256
Yeah, she's real thrilled
to see me.

348
00:14:56,344 --> 00:14:59,436
Um, did you even consider maybe
telling her I was coming?

349
00:14:59,927 --> 00:15:01,129
Oh, yeah,

350
00:15:01,217 --> 00:15:03,350
but then she probably
would have bailed.

351
00:15:03,588 --> 00:15:05,400
Mm-hmm. And then you wouldn't be
having dinner

352
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:07,042
with your boyfriend's ex.

353
00:15:07,486 --> 00:15:09,303
Time to eat!

354
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,998
Well,
it's too late now, so...

355
00:15:17,238 --> 00:15:18,465
Oh, actually,
my mom usually sits here,

356
00:15:18,552 --> 00:15:19,530
so we'll just...

357
00:15:19,618 --> 00:15:22,331
Sit. Sit. It's fine.
Nobody cares.

358
00:15:22,431 --> 00:15:24,993
Nobody cares 
about anything.

359
00:15:25,854 --> 00:15:28,424
Everybody sit.
Please.

360
00:15:32,549 --> 00:15:34,419
Smells great in there.
What'd you make?

361
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,350
Shrimp scampi.

362
00:15:37,564 --> 00:15:39,505
Is there a problem?
Are you allergic?

363
00:15:39,593 --> 00:15:40,494
Vic?
No.

364
00:15:40,582 --> 00:15:42,495
She'll put anything
in her mouth.

365
00:15:46,762 --> 00:15:48,255
Anything...
Anything that's food.

366
00:15:48,467 --> 00:15:49,796
Only food.

367
00:15:50,384 --> 00:15:52,697
Hm.
How lovely.

368
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:55,790
- A little salad, dear, please?
- Thank you.

369
00:15:56,004 --> 00:15:57,307
Let me tell you
about that time

370
00:15:57,395 --> 00:15:59,479
she stopped a snake
from eating a baby.

371
00:16:04,526 --> 00:16:06,487
So, Dr. Webber,
you're Maggie's father.

372
00:16:06,575 --> 00:16:08,112
Call me Richard, please.

373
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,846
And yes, I am.

374
00:16:10,237 --> 00:16:12,610
And Dr. Fox...
Or do you prefer Catherine?

375
00:16:13,142 --> 00:16:14,619
Dr. Fox is fine.

376
00:16:15,009 --> 00:16:17,056
Okay.
You're Jackson's mother?

377
00:16:17,231 --> 00:16:19,322
Uh, pass the bread,
please.

378
00:16:20,511 --> 00:16:22,322
Yes.
I'm Jackson's mother.

379
00:16:22,878 --> 00:16:24,541
So, when you two
started dating,

380
00:16:24,629 --> 00:16:26,385
was that before
they got married?

381
00:16:26,473 --> 00:16:28,135
Not really, no.

382
00:16:28,449 --> 00:16:30,344
We never thought of
ourselves as family.

383
00:16:30,432 --> 00:16:31,174
Yes, you did.

384
00:16:31,262 --> 00:16:32,236
That's why I had
such a reaction

385
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:34,026
when the two of you started
rolling around together.

386
00:16:34,113 --> 00:16:35,844
No, Mom.

387
00:16:36,027 --> 00:16:38,158
We were happy for them.

388
00:16:38,246 --> 00:16:39,019
- Hm.
- Mm.

389
00:16:39,107 --> 00:16:40,729
Thank you.

390
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,166
Jackson and I
didn't grow up together.

391
00:16:43,284 --> 00:16:45,830
We had very different
upbringings.

392
00:16:45,933 --> 00:16:46,565
How so?

393
00:16:46,676 --> 00:16:48,877
I took a bus to school,
and he had a private chauffeur.

394
00:16:48,991 --> 00:16:50,074
Dean's
a rich boy, too.

395
00:16:50,162 --> 00:16:51,486
Oh, are you?

396
00:16:51,597 --> 00:16:53,198
Maggie doesn't like guys
that have money.

397
00:16:53,286 --> 00:16:55,041
No, I like the ones
who are down to earth.

398
00:16:56,059 --> 00:16:57,764
So, Maggie,
you grew up in Boston?

399
00:16:57,852 --> 00:16:58,643
Mm-hmm.

400
00:16:58,731 --> 00:17:00,338
I have a cousin
in Brighton.

401
00:17:00,426 --> 00:17:01,736
Oh, yeah?
What street?

402
00:17:01,824 --> 00:17:04,510
I don't remember.
There were old brick houses.

403
00:17:04,598 --> 00:17:05,801
- Does that help?
- Yeah.

404
00:17:05,889 --> 00:17:07,144
Yeah, that really
narrows it down.

405
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:11,502
Oh, you know what?

406
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:13,543
You remember
the Korean restaurant we loved,

407
00:17:13,631 --> 00:17:15,244
uh, near my old place
on Graham?

408
00:17:15,332 --> 00:17:16,432
- Mm-hmm.
- It burned down.

409
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,683
Vic saved the owner,

410
00:17:17,771 --> 00:17:18,901
pulled him right out
of the kitchen.

411
00:17:18,988 --> 00:17:20,283
He was
the sweetest old man.

412
00:17:20,371 --> 00:17:21,533
He got really shaken up.

413
00:17:21,678 --> 00:17:22,666
Apparently, the landlord

414
00:17:22,754 --> 00:17:25,307
hadn't changed the electrical
wiring in like a decade.

415
00:17:25,395 --> 00:17:27,688
Sadly, we see it all the time
in old restaurants.

416
00:17:28,158 --> 00:17:29,807
That's a terrible story.

417
00:17:33,356 --> 00:17:36,231
Richard, you're a surgeon,
too, right? A general?

418
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:37,705
Yes, I am.
At Pac-North.

419
00:17:37,847 --> 00:17:38,941
When I was in training,

420
00:17:39,029 --> 00:17:40,238
we called that place
"The Morgue."

421
00:17:41,644 --> 00:17:43,097
Did they know back then

422
00:17:43,185 --> 00:17:45,678
that there was a burial ground
in the backyard?

423
00:17:45,936 --> 00:17:47,979
They broke ground on a new wing

424
00:17:48,121 --> 00:17:50,404
and found out
the place used to be an asylum.

425
00:17:50,506 --> 00:17:53,822
Unclaimed bodies just tossed
in a hole like feces. Oof!

426
00:17:55,193 --> 00:17:58,198
We didn't exactly publicize
that incident, Catherine.

427
00:17:58,286 --> 00:17:59,299
Hmm.

428
00:17:59,393 --> 00:18:01,299
The bodies were removed
respectfully.

429
00:18:01,481 --> 00:18:02,869
T-That's... good.

430
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:04,948
'Ve heard things have
really turned around. - Yeah.

431
00:18:05,035 --> 00:18:06,488
Now the nickname's
just Pac-North,

432
00:18:06,576 --> 00:18:07,819
so you know.

433
00:18:08,053 --> 00:18:09,244
Not really a nickname.

434
00:18:09,332 --> 00:18:10,495
Actually,
it is a nickname.

435
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:11,956
It's short for
Pacific Northwest.

436
00:18:12,044 --> 00:18:13,064
You say "actually"
a lot.

437
00:18:13,152 --> 00:18:15,355
I just meant that first
responders all over the city

438
00:18:15,443 --> 00:18:16,828
are talking about
the improvements

439
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:17,893
over the past few months.

440
00:18:17,981 --> 00:18:19,745
People really want to bring
their patients there now.

441
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:21,627
Oh, how about that?
That's really, really great.

442
00:18:21,714 --> 00:18:24,297
You mean they prefer to
go there over Grey-Sloan?

443
00:18:24,393 --> 00:18:26,056
- Mom.
- Catherine, you've only seen

444
00:18:26,143 --> 00:18:27,307
the waiting room
at Pac-North.

445
00:18:27,395 --> 00:18:28,728
I've seen more.

446
00:18:28,933 --> 00:18:30,518
The outside of your office.

447
00:18:30,606 --> 00:18:33,149
Hmm.
When?

448
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:36,527
You were busy having coffee
with a friend.

449
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:40,361
Just to clarify,
I like both hospitals.

450
00:18:40,449 --> 00:18:42,406
How about we just change
the subject entirely?

451
00:18:42,494 --> 00:18:43,367
- Yeah!
- I'm for that.

452
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:44,716
- Please.
- Yay.

453
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:50,073
It is your anniversary, 
right?

454
00:18:50,723 --> 00:18:52,127
How did you two meet?

455
00:19:02,889 --> 00:19:04,455
- Maybe we can just...
- Nope.

456
00:19:05,349 --> 00:19:07,908
I'm saying just a little
something to eat.

457
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:10,265
You're sounding like
my mom now.

458
00:19:38,207 --> 00:19:40,877
They said he was sick.

459
00:19:43,731 --> 00:19:45,564
Didn't say...

460
00:19:45,933 --> 00:19:48,557
I'm so sorry.
I'm... I'm Levi.

461
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:50,908
I know
exactly who you are.

462
00:19:51,904 --> 00:19:53,111
Doctor.

463
00:19:56,856 --> 00:19:58,965
They used to
call you "Glasses."

464
00:19:59,236 --> 00:20:00,260
Uh...

465
00:20:00,348 --> 00:20:04,525
But now you've made a-a real
name for yourself, right?

466
00:20:05,045 --> 00:20:06,298
Saul talked about me?

467
00:20:06,386 --> 00:20:07,643
All the time.

468
00:20:07,948 --> 00:20:11,596
And you... you must be
Levi's boyfriend.

469
00:20:12,856 --> 00:20:13,926
Right?

470
00:20:14,014 --> 00:20:15,275
You knew?

471
00:20:15,792 --> 00:20:18,245
Saul... Saul knew?

472
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:19,536
Of course he knew.

473
00:20:19,624 --> 00:20:21,627
Excellent gaydar.

474
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,033
I'm sorry, what?

475
00:20:23,121 --> 00:20:25,661
It takes one
to know one, son.

476
00:20:27,176 --> 00:20:28,666
I'm Daniel Schwartz.

477
00:20:29,284 --> 00:20:30,317
Nico.

478
00:20:30,405 --> 00:20:32,010
Uh, but Gertie
was his wife.

479
00:20:32,357 --> 00:20:35,230
Gertie and Saul took each other
for who they were.

480
00:20:35,481 --> 00:20:40,283
They lived their lives,
never asked any questions,

481
00:20:40,838 --> 00:20:42,668
and they never told a soul.

482
00:20:45,513 --> 00:20:47,088
So you're...

483
00:20:47,176 --> 00:20:49,639
Saul was
the love of my life.

484
00:20:56,873 --> 00:20:58,463
And I was his.

485
00:21:00,269 --> 00:21:02,099
And I guess
we still are.

486
00:21:09,982 --> 00:21:11,869
Wait.
So, she proposed to you?

487
00:21:12,065 --> 00:21:14,507
Yeah, I mean, mom's used to
always getting what she wants,

488
00:21:14,595 --> 00:21:16,617
and if she's got to ask,
she'll ask.

489
00:21:16,705 --> 00:21:17,836
I wouldn't say
"always."

490
00:21:17,924 --> 00:21:20,009
That was 
a long time ago.

491
00:21:20,158 --> 00:21:21,827
And it wasn't just
any proposal.

492
00:21:21,939 --> 00:21:23,765
It was quite
the spectacle.

493
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:25,469
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

494
00:21:25,557 --> 00:21:26,658
Tell them, Catherine.

495
00:21:26,746 --> 00:21:28,814
- You're doing so well.
- Okay.

496
00:21:28,932 --> 00:21:32,588
Um, so, Catherine
hired a string quartet,

497
00:21:32,675 --> 00:21:35,289
and she's got them hiding
in the lobby of the hospital,

498
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:38,484
which is filled with...
with roses and candles.

499
00:21:38,572 --> 00:21:41,515
Mom hates romantic gestures.
This is not her style at all.

500
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:44,476
Richard had been trying to
propose romantically for months.

501
00:21:44,572 --> 00:21:47,096
And she wouldn't let him.
She just called it "nonsense."

502
00:21:47,713 --> 00:21:49,172
So, Richard's at work,

503
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:51,281
and Catherine
starts shouting at him.

504
00:21:51,369 --> 00:21:52,638
And she's yelling about

505
00:21:52,725 --> 00:21:54,953
how Richard is worth
every heartbreak,

506
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:57,555
and she doesn't care
if she looks like a fool

507
00:21:57,643 --> 00:22:00,083
yelling her feelings
out in front of everyone.

508
00:22:00,171 --> 00:22:03,047
And then
she walks down the stairs

509
00:22:03,135 --> 00:22:05,138
and she looks in his eyes
and takes his hands,

510
00:22:05,225 --> 00:22:07,955
and she says...

511
00:22:08,525 --> 00:22:11,596
"And I would very much like it
if you would be my husband."

512
00:22:14,611 --> 00:22:16,281
Tell 'em what you said,
Richard.

513
00:22:21,353 --> 00:22:23,626
Oh, you two really like to
build that suspense.

514
00:22:23,844 --> 00:22:25,257
Come on, come on!

515
00:22:25,369 --> 00:22:27,088
I said...

516
00:22:27,494 --> 00:22:29,125
"Well,
it's about damn time."

517
00:22:30,309 --> 00:22:32,594
That's Richard Webber.
Alright, you know what?

518
00:22:32,682 --> 00:22:34,195
- It's time for a toast.
- Aww.

519
00:22:34,283 --> 00:22:35,484
To these two
amazing people.

520
00:22:35,572 --> 00:22:37,588
To Catherine and Richard.

521
00:22:37,807 --> 00:22:40,416
I am so happy
that my mom found you.

522
00:22:40,524 --> 00:22:42,164
Richard, you've been more
a father to me

523
00:22:42,252 --> 00:22:43,555
than my birth father ever was.

524
00:22:43,643 --> 00:22:46,140
I've never seen anyone
make my mom happier.

525
00:22:46,228 --> 00:22:47,500
Y'all have had
your ups and downs,

526
00:22:47,587 --> 00:22:49,054
but you always
push through.

527
00:22:49,142 --> 00:22:52,010
You two are
the gold standard.

528
00:22:52,899 --> 00:22:54,705
I love you.
Happy anniversary.

529
00:22:54,838 --> 00:22:55,930
To you. Happy

530
00:22:56,018 --> 00:22:57,806
- Anniversary. - Happy anniversary.
- So sweet.

531
00:22:57,893 --> 00:22:58,953
Thank you.

532
00:23:01,189 --> 00:23:04,414
So, Saul says that there's this
huge emergency at the bank.

533
00:23:04,502 --> 00:23:06,750
They're willing to pay
three times per roll

534
00:23:06,838 --> 00:23:09,336
for anyone who can bring in
the most pennies in an hour.

535
00:23:09,424 --> 00:23:11,859
So, I scramble
around all the couch cushions,

536
00:23:11,947 --> 00:23:14,064
he's helping me
pack 'em in like sardines.

537
00:23:14,268 --> 00:23:18,213
10 minutes later,
he comes back with a $50 bill.

538
00:23:18,424 --> 00:23:20,273
And I feel like
I saved the freakin' world.

539
00:23:20,361 --> 00:23:22,353
From...
a penny shortage?

540
00:23:22,519 --> 00:23:23,773
I was 6.

541
00:23:23,861 --> 00:23:26,312
But you realize
there's no such thing, right?

542
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,307
Wait, really?

543
00:23:33,965 --> 00:23:37,393
Oh, oh, we shouldn't be
laughing like this.

544
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,008
It's okay, son.

545
00:23:39,096 --> 00:23:41,297
The only people Saul
would want to make miserable

546
00:23:41,385 --> 00:23:43,617
are your mom
and a few ex-boyfriends.

547
00:23:45,314 --> 00:23:47,447
Oh, he really
hated my mom.

548
00:23:47,627 --> 00:23:48,914
He never trusted her.

549
00:23:49,002 --> 00:23:50,508
She learned
from her parents

550
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:53,260
about who is supposed to
lie with whom.

551
00:23:53,994 --> 00:23:55,070
And she bought into it.

552
00:23:55,158 --> 00:23:56,781
My family never cared.

553
00:23:56,869 --> 00:23:58,783
Thought I was exotic,

554
00:23:58,978 --> 00:24:03,072
told every neighbor
or postman who'd listen.

555
00:24:06,704 --> 00:24:09,000
The Chevra Kaddisha
should be here by now.

556
00:24:09,088 --> 00:24:11,133
I-I-I don't like
leaving him like this.

557
00:24:11,221 --> 00:24:12,736
We don't have to
if you don't want to.

558
00:24:12,824 --> 00:24:13,908
I've been trained.

559
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:16,744
I can teach you
how to prepare his body.

560
00:24:17,869 --> 00:24:20,031
I wouldn't want you
to have to...

561
00:24:22,497 --> 00:24:24,287
It would be my honor.

562
00:24:38,711 --> 00:24:41,963
I hadn't thought about
that story in a long time.

563
00:24:42,768 --> 00:24:43,908
I know. Me either.

564
00:24:43,996 --> 00:24:47,949
Richard, maybe we've been too
rash with this separation.

565
00:24:48,271 --> 00:24:49,830
Jackson is right.

566
00:24:50,446 --> 00:24:52,519
We've been through
bad times,

567
00:24:52,925 --> 00:24:55,384
month-long arguments,

568
00:24:56,205 --> 00:24:59,158
but we do
always find a way.

569
00:25:00,208 --> 00:25:03,010
I know we're angry
with each other

570
00:25:04,145 --> 00:25:05,760
and we're hard-headed,

571
00:25:07,493 --> 00:25:11,291
but I think
we shouldn't give up.

572
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:13,447
The wine's
making you misty.

573
00:25:13,833 --> 00:25:15,822
It's not the wine,
Richard.

574
00:25:17,381 --> 00:25:18,994
I love you.

575
00:25:24,544 --> 00:25:26,299
Then apologize.

576
00:25:27,357 --> 00:25:30,791
I know that doesn't
come easy for you,

577
00:25:32,347 --> 00:25:34,385
but if you love me,
Catherine,

578
00:25:34,793 --> 00:25:36,478
and you want this
to work...

579
00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:40,971
say that you're sorry
that you didn't stand by me.

580
00:25:41,473 --> 00:25:43,643
That you showed
no loyalty.

581
00:25:43,731 --> 00:25:46,088
That I had to
reinvent my life.

582
00:25:47,784 --> 00:25:51,658
That I had to leave behind
the hospital that I built,

583
00:25:52,755 --> 00:25:54,338
people I loved.

584
00:25:56,498 --> 00:25:58,502
You've said
a lot of things,

585
00:26:00,409 --> 00:26:02,416
but "sorry"
wasn't one of them.

586
00:26:03,649 --> 00:26:04,869
Richard...

587
00:26:06,393 --> 00:26:09,096
I am sorry, but...

588
00:26:09,269 --> 00:26:12,689
Apologies don't have
the word "but" after them.

589
00:26:14,505 --> 00:26:16,307
"I'm sorry but"...

590
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:20,689
is too little, Catherine.

591
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:24,143
It's too late.

592
00:27:22,472 --> 00:27:23,595
Why Gertie?

593
00:27:23,683 --> 00:27:24,947
Why pretend?

594
00:27:25,035 --> 00:27:27,823
Why not just build a home
and a life

595
00:27:27,911 --> 00:27:29,621
with the man you love?

596
00:27:32,705 --> 00:27:34,988
I'm sorry.
I did not mean to pry.

597
00:27:35,223 --> 00:27:39,557
Your generation takes
for granted what is possible.

598
00:27:39,693 --> 00:27:40,906
I'm sorry, I...

599
00:27:40,994 --> 00:27:43,364
No, no, no, no.
It's... It's okay.

600
00:27:45,979 --> 00:27:51,963
In fact, it gives me hope
that it has come so far

601
00:27:52,988 --> 00:27:56,096
that you could take that
for granted, even for a second.

602
00:28:01,069 --> 00:28:02,603
Saul loved men.

603
00:28:03,622 --> 00:28:04,955
He loved me.

604
00:28:05,902 --> 00:28:07,228
For decades.

605
00:28:08,385 --> 00:28:10,728
But there was something
inside of him...

606
00:28:12,202 --> 00:28:13,535
that wouldn't let him.

607
00:28:13,763 --> 00:28:15,697
I would have married him,

608
00:28:16,238 --> 00:28:20,064
I would've... I would've
built a home with him.

609
00:28:20,689 --> 00:28:22,484
But I didn't know
how to live a life

610
00:28:22,572 --> 00:28:27,893
with someone who hated himself
for loving me.

611
00:28:28,768 --> 00:28:30,619
He was ashamed
of himself.

612
00:28:30,722 --> 00:28:32,447
Every day.

613
00:28:35,661 --> 00:28:37,744
And... And Gertie?
She didn't know?

614
00:28:38,087 --> 00:28:39,290
Of course she knew.

615
00:28:39,433 --> 00:28:41,846
She pretended
they were married

616
00:28:43,183 --> 00:28:46,205
because they cared
for each other.

617
00:28:47,003 --> 00:28:50,536
And because he...
He asked her.

618
00:28:51,127 --> 00:28:53,557
I will never take it
for granted again.

619
00:28:55,458 --> 00:28:59,080
You know,
I don't think it's an accident,

620
00:28:59,535 --> 00:29:02,118
you being here
until the end.

621
00:29:02,346 --> 00:29:06,469
He saw you, who you are,
all of you.

622
00:29:06,563 --> 00:29:10,056
I think there's a part of him
that wanted you to come here

623
00:29:10,214 --> 00:29:15,096
so that you would know
it's okay...

624
00:29:15,434 --> 00:29:18,227
that you'd have
the freedom

625
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:20,955
that he never
gave himself.

This cork is so chewed up.

650
00:30:46,308 --> 00:30:47,431
- Give it here.
- Mm.

652
00:30:51,031 --> 00:30:52,324
You barely talked
to Vic.

653
00:30:52,411 --> 00:30:54,002
You know how awkward
this is for her?

654
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:57,119
This was supposed to be
a small family gathering.

655
00:30:57,207 --> 00:30:59,160
And your plus one
brought a plus one.

656
00:30:59,248 --> 00:31:00,411
So what?

657
00:31:00,499 --> 00:31:02,892
Two more people at dinner...
Is that a big deal?

658
00:31:04,201 --> 00:31:05,444
What's going on
with you and Richard?

659
00:31:05,531 --> 00:31:07,127
I thought you all
cleared everything up.

660
00:31:08,306 --> 00:31:10,204
Let's talk about it later.

661
00:31:10,418 --> 00:31:12,041
This is not the time.

662
00:31:12,129 --> 00:31:13,299
Thank you.

663
00:31:15,256 --> 00:31:17,845
Wait, wait, wait.
You live on a boat?

664
00:31:17,933 --> 00:31:18,966
Yeah.

665
00:31:19,139 --> 00:31:21,438
What is it with rich guys
and boats?

666
00:31:22,447 --> 00:31:24,531
You have a boat?

667
00:31:24,635 --> 00:31:26,412
Do you tell her
anything?

668
00:31:26,616 --> 00:31:27,904
It was an impulse buy.

669
00:31:27,991 --> 00:31:29,448
I do have a boat,
guilty as charged.

670
00:31:29,627 --> 00:31:30,651
"Impulse buy."

671
00:31:30,815 --> 00:31:33,389
Shoes are an impulse buy,
maybe a car.

672
00:31:33,477 --> 00:31:34,727
Jackson bought a yacht.

673
00:31:35,477 --> 00:31:37,284
What did you spend?
Two million? Three million?

674
00:31:37,371 --> 00:31:38,329
Where do you dock yours?

675
00:31:38,417 --> 00:31:39,581
Getting kind of old now,
Maggie.

676
00:31:39,683 --> 00:31:41,471
I think you're kind of
embarrassing yourself.

677
00:31:41,627 --> 00:31:43,113
I'm pretty sure I'm not.

678
00:31:43,201 --> 00:31:44,845
Does he do this with you?

679
00:31:44,932 --> 00:31:46,431
Does he try to
change you all the time?

680
00:31:46,518 --> 00:31:47,750
No.
Oddly enough,

681
00:31:47,892 --> 00:31:49,610
I like her
just the way she is.

682
00:31:52,288 --> 00:31:53,547
Oh, yeah.

683
00:31:54,836 --> 00:31:56,055
Hey.

684
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:59,863
Uh, uh... Um, um...
I'm... I'm... I'm sorry, um...

685
00:32:00,051 --> 00:32:01,425
What... What...
What were you saying?

686
00:32:01,512 --> 00:32:03,385
He and Maggie
are arguing.

687
00:32:03,473 --> 00:32:05,056
They can't stand
each other.

688
00:32:05,144 --> 00:32:07,288
They've been trying to
be civil for our sake,

689
00:32:07,376 --> 00:32:08,438
which is a total joke.

690
00:32:08,526 --> 00:32:10,979
But you haven't been around
enough to notice, have you?

691
00:32:11,067 --> 00:32:12,079
Well, that would be hard

692
00:32:12,167 --> 00:32:14,080
since I no longer work
at the same hospital.

693
00:32:14,254 --> 00:32:16,446
'Cause you took a job
at a glorified clinic

694
00:32:16,534 --> 00:32:18,447
just to spite
your own wife.

695
00:32:18,535 --> 00:32:19,751
I didn't have
a choice

696
00:32:19,839 --> 00:32:22,600
after I was fired
from the one she owns.

697
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,520
Don't you even look at that
phone, Richard Webber.

698
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:30,613
Why didn't you
just invite her

699
00:32:30,774 --> 00:32:33,074
since you can't go
20 minutes without texting?

700
00:32:33,161 --> 00:32:34,864
Invite who?
His girlfriend.

701
00:32:34,951 --> 00:32:36,743
Some Pac-North heifer.
Oh.

702
00:32:36,831 --> 00:32:39,161
I don't have
a girlfriend, Catherine.

703
00:32:39,249 --> 00:32:40,525
Something I've been
trying to drill

704
00:32:40,612 --> 00:32:41,985
in your thick skull
for months!

705
00:32:42,073 --> 00:32:44,077
- Well, I don't believe you.
- See for yourself.

706
00:32:44,165 --> 00:32:45,743
Can we not do this now?

707
00:32:50,311 --> 00:32:51,814
You wouldn't dare.

708
00:32:51,939 --> 00:32:53,012
I certainly would.

709
00:32:53,116 --> 00:32:54,369
Dare what?

710
00:32:54,457 --> 00:32:55,649
I've been talking to
Karev

711
00:32:55,737 --> 00:32:58,740
about making you an offer
to run our cardio department.

712
00:32:59,063 --> 00:33:00,143
He approved the offer.

713
00:33:00,231 --> 00:33:01,440
It's ridiculous.

714
00:33:01,588 --> 00:33:03,336
She wouldn't step out of her
comfort zone

715
00:33:03,424 --> 00:33:05,707
- for that.
- You don't know what I would do.

716
00:33:05,943 --> 00:33:07,607
Is this what you wanted to
tell us earlier?

717
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:10,487
No! We wanted to tell you
that we're separating.

718
00:33:10,636 --> 00:33:14,299
It was supposed to be quiet
and loving, not a potluck.

719
00:33:14,387 --> 00:33:15,485
You're separating?

720
00:33:15,573 --> 00:33:17,258
How long has this
been going on?

721
00:33:17,358 --> 00:33:18,778
Who cares?

722
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:21,969
It's over now.

723
00:33:25,854 --> 00:33:28,097
Richard,
I had no idea.

724
00:33:28,316 --> 00:33:29,680
Um...

725
00:33:31,494 --> 00:33:36,227
I'm... sorry you had to
hear it this way.

726
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:38,680
I really am.

727
00:33:41,004 --> 00:33:42,127
Excuse me.

728
00:33:47,951 --> 00:33:49,680
- Uh, excuse me.
- Okay, yeah.

729
00:34:02,411 --> 00:34:03,637
Yep.

730
00:34:04,627 --> 00:34:06,200
You definitely owe me.

731
00:34:23,162 --> 00:34:24,407
Mom.

732
00:34:24,495 --> 00:34:26,758
I thought y'all had
worked things out.

733
00:34:26,846 --> 00:34:28,178
- I'm sorry.
- [ Exhales sharply

734
00:34:28,266 --> 00:34:29,469
No, it's fine.

735
00:34:29,934 --> 00:34:31,477
It's fine, I'll...

736
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:33,610
I'll be fine, I just...

737
00:34:33,712 --> 00:34:35,759
I just hate you
losing Richard.

738
00:34:35,922 --> 00:34:37,308
He's like a father
to you.

739
00:34:37,396 --> 00:34:39,024
Don't be silly.
I'm not losing anything.

740
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:40,203
Don't worry about me.

741
00:34:40,290 --> 00:34:41,852
I feel like
such a failure.

742
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:43,055
I tried, Jackson.

743
00:34:43,143 --> 00:34:44,531
- Hey, you are not a failure
- I tried.

744
00:34:44,618 --> 00:34:45,584
At anything.

745
00:34:45,672 --> 00:34:47,154
Sometimes relationships
just don't work out.

746
00:34:47,241 --> 00:34:48,711
You know that.
That's all.

747
00:34:49,526 --> 00:34:50,704
Come on.

748
00:34:50,854 --> 00:34:53,118
You are
such a good man.

749
00:34:53,241 --> 00:34:54,494
Oh, who do we have
to thank for that?

750
00:34:59,633 --> 00:35:01,915
I was just
dropping these off.

751
00:35:03,207 --> 00:35:04,758
Oh, wait, Vic.

752
00:35:04,846 --> 00:35:08,985
You haven't had any of my
blackberry cobbler yet.

753
00:35:09,161 --> 00:35:10,547
She is kinda famous
for it.

754
00:35:10,635 --> 00:35:12,403
Yeah, yeah.
I'd really like that.

755
00:35:12,491 --> 00:35:13,704
Good.

756
00:35:13,791 --> 00:35:15,189
- 'Cause if you had said no...
- Thank you.

757
00:35:15,276 --> 00:35:17,190
..I was gonna have to eat this
whole damn thing myself.

758
00:35:18,398 --> 00:35:20,459
- Dig in.
- Ooh.

759
00:35:20,547 --> 00:35:21,904
Is this...?
Yeah. Just get in there.

760
00:35:21,991 --> 00:35:23,284
- Just go for it? Okay.
- Mm!

761
00:35:23,485 --> 00:35:24,614
Mom, no.

762
00:35:25,987 --> 00:35:28,310
No, guilty pleasure.
I need it.

763
00:35:28,398 --> 00:35:29,568
I deserve it.

764
00:35:32,002 --> 00:35:33,496
Jackson mentioned
that he thought

765
00:35:33,584 --> 00:35:36,805
you two might be... off,

766
00:35:36,911 --> 00:35:40,180
but I... I had
no idea.

767
00:35:40,302 --> 00:35:44,465
Catherine and I tend to
keep our problems to ourselves.

768
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:46,891
That was
quite a show, huh?

769
00:35:47,947 --> 00:35:49,930
Catherine thought
that a nice meal

770
00:35:50,018 --> 00:35:52,399
would make it easier to
break the news.

771
00:35:52,852 --> 00:35:54,324
You think
it's really over?

772
00:35:54,411 --> 00:35:55,751
I do, unfortunately.

773
00:35:56,223 --> 00:35:57,806
I'm sorry.

774
00:35:58,252 --> 00:35:59,508
Ah.

775
00:35:59,977 --> 00:36:02,602
I thought we were celebrating.
I brought chocolates.

776
00:36:04,126 --> 00:36:05,554
Well, at least
you didn't bring a date.

777
00:36:08,676 --> 00:36:12,032
We thought we needed to
get along for your sakes.

778
00:36:12,518 --> 00:36:14,359
At least we can
stop doing that.

779
00:36:14,627 --> 00:36:16,805
Yeah. I guess we can
all stop pretending.

780
00:36:19,053 --> 00:36:20,306
Hey,
what was that offer?

781
00:36:20,394 --> 00:36:22,307
From, uh, Pac-North.

782
00:36:22,455 --> 00:36:23,813
I'm curious.

783
00:36:24,341 --> 00:36:26,149
Maggie,
you don't have to humor me.

784
00:36:26,556 --> 00:36:28,024
I'm a free agent.

785
00:36:28,533 --> 00:36:29,579
If the price is right...

786
00:36:29,667 --> 00:36:31,330
Look who knows
how to bargain.

787
00:36:39,081 --> 00:36:40,360
Um...

788
00:36:40,802 --> 00:36:42,719
Alex thinks
I'm worth this much?

789
00:36:42,824 --> 00:36:44,383
Not just Alex, Maggie.

790
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:49,446
Then I guess
I have a new job.

791
00:36:54,158 --> 00:36:56,586
Are you sure
you're gonna be okay?

792
00:36:57,056 --> 00:37:00,594
Eh, you know,
I'll go to a meeting.

793
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:03,157
Yeah, I'll be fine.

794
00:37:05,621 --> 00:37:07,074
I'll see you Monday.

795
00:37:07,277 --> 00:37:08,737
I'll see you Monday.

796
00:37:18,848 --> 00:37:20,103
Leaving so soon?

797
00:37:20,866 --> 00:37:23,353
This was not a place
I should have been.

798
00:37:24,094 --> 00:37:25,415
Oh.
Yeah.

799
00:37:25,868 --> 00:37:27,063
Thank you.

800
00:37:27,479 --> 00:37:28,682
I'll, um...

801
00:37:28,770 --> 00:37:30,243
I'll see you around,
Pierce.

802
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:31,351
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

803
00:37:31,439 --> 00:37:32,868
See ya.

804
00:37:38,246 --> 00:37:39,624
Hey, I'm...
I'm sorry

805
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:43,860
about... that.

806
00:37:44,033 --> 00:37:45,907
It's not your fault.

807
00:37:46,033 --> 00:37:48,392
Uh, I don't think any of us
should have been here tonight.

808
00:37:48,531 --> 00:37:49,696
Yeah.

809
00:37:51,385 --> 00:37:53,743
Uh, Vic, wait.
I, um...

810
00:37:53,956 --> 00:37:57,402
I clearly still have some
differences with Jackson,

811
00:37:57,490 --> 00:37:59,180
but I think I've been
taking them out on you,

812
00:37:59,267 --> 00:38:01,970
and I'm really sorry about that,
and it's not cool.

813
00:38:02,058 --> 00:38:03,864
I... I won't do it again.

814
00:38:03,951 --> 00:38:05,704
You know what, I set you up
on a date without telling you,

815
00:38:05,791 --> 00:38:07,548
- so I think we're even. Okay.
- Deal.

816
00:38:07,636 --> 00:38:09,367
Alright.

817
00:38:09,455 --> 00:38:11,035

yet refusing to tell
any member of our family...

836

She didn't.

were you hoping I'd fail?

I was hoping
you'd come to your senses.

It's not killing me.
I'm embarrassed for you.

872
00:40:40,974 --> 00:40:44,738
It's one thing for you to flush
your own career down the toilet.

873
00:40:44,889 --> 00:40:47,017
Now you want to
drag her down with you?

874
00:40:47,105 --> 00:40:47,944
Your own child?

875
00:40:48,031 --> 00:40:49,402
She's gonna put us
on the map,

876
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:51,384
and it will have
nothing to do with you,

877
00:40:51,472 --> 00:40:52,925
and you can't stand that,

878
00:40:53,013 --> 00:40:55,527
because you need to
control everything.

879
00:40:55,621 --> 00:40:56,581
But I've moved on.

880
00:40:56,669 --> 00:40:58,422
And I will do what I want,

881
00:40:58,533 --> 00:41:00,902
and I will hire
whomever I want.

882
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:04,543
And there isn't a thing in this
world you can do to stop me.

883
00:41:04,881 --> 00:41:08,480

884
00:41:08,568 --> 00:41:12,292

886
00:41:15,631 --> 00:41:17,285
Yes, Harry, it's me.

887
00:41:17,661 --> 00:41:19,363
Sorry to call you so late.

888
00:41:19,988 --> 00:41:21,660
But I'd like you
to put out some feelers

889
00:41:21,748 --> 00:41:23,331
about buying Pac-North.

890
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:25,090
Oh, please.

891
00:41:25,223 --> 00:41:26,976
No, Harry.
It's not a joke.

892
00:41:27,095 --> 00:41:28,238
Find out their price.

893
00:41:28,326 --> 00:41:29,917
I'm sure they have one.

894
00:41:30,978 --> 00:41:32,738
You too.
Good night.

895
00:41:33,949 --> 00:41:35,777
<i>Hope it isn't over.</i>

896
00:41:35,986 --> 00:41:38,863
Hope to be saved from pain
and loss and despair.

897
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:40,353
This is absurd.

898
00:41:40,495 --> 00:41:42,035
And it's not gonna work.

899
00:41:43,495 --> 00:41:44,534
We'll see.

00:41:44,621 --> 00:41:45,933
<i>♪ With every bone I break ♪</i>

901
00:41:46,021 --> 00:41:49,027
Catherine, what in the hell do
you want with my hospital?

902
00:41:49,115 --> 00:41:51,448
Well, you said that
the place is turning around.

903
00:41:51,674 --> 00:41:53,337
It could be
a good investment.

904
00:41:53,525 --> 00:41:55,456
Or maybe I'll just
shut it down.

905

♪ Won't make the same mistakes ♪

906
00:41:58,606 --> 00:41:59,925
And Richard...

907
00:42:00,229 --> 00:42:02,443
I'm not sorry
about a damn thing.

908
00:42:02,531 --> 00:42:04,542

909
