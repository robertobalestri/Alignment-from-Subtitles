1
00:00:01,328 --> 00:00:03,831
<i>Some of the world's
top trauma specialists</i>

2
00:00:03,918 --> 00:00:05,161
<i>have proven that our brains</i>

3
00:00:05,248 --> 00:00:07,343
<i>may forget the traumas
we survive...</i>

4
00:00:07,453 --> 00:00:10,521
<i>But our bodies,
especially our nervous systems,</i>

5
00:00:10,617 --> 00:00:12,140
<i>always keep score.</i>

6
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:13,470
BP's dropping.

7
00:00:13,558 --> 00:00:14,797
Can you mobilize
the liver better?

8
00:00:14,884 --> 00:00:16,730
It's the IVC.
Clamp.

9
00:00:16,818 --> 00:00:18,891
What?

10
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:20,703
No, I need a clamp!

11
00:00:20,791 --> 00:00:21,907
Maybe you should've
thought of that

12
00:00:21,994 --> 00:00:24,218
before skipping out
on community service.

13
00:00:24,337 --> 00:00:25,662
- We've got it.
- But I...

14
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:27,086
- Let's get two units of blood.
- I'm on it.

15
00:00:27,173 --> 00:00:28,865
<i>We need
distal and proximal control.</i>

16
00:00:28,953 --> 00:00:30,430
<i>Clamp.
Let's do total vascular exclusion.</i>

17
00:00:30,517 --> 00:00:31,773
Mom.

18
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,671
I don't feel good.

19
00:00:36,728 --> 00:00:38,640
Me either, ZoZo.

20
00:00:42,259 --> 00:00:43,406
<i>Memories are stored</i>

21
00:00:43,494 --> 00:00:46,515
<i>in our shoulders, spines,
stomach, or hands,</i>

22
00:00:46,608 --> 00:00:48,117
<i>without us ever knowing.</i>

23
00:00:48,421 --> 00:00:51,062
It was one of the worst fires
I've ever seen.

24
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:52,804
Smoke was so thick...

25
00:00:52,892 --> 00:00:54,680
and the roof...
It wouldn't hold...

26
00:00:54,768 --> 00:00:55,924
It was...

27
00:00:56,213 --> 00:00:57,390
Is that your way
of telling me

28
00:00:57,478 --> 00:00:59,226
I'm taking Tuck
to school today?

29
00:00:59,398 --> 00:01:00,570
Isn't he in college yet?

30
00:01:00,784 --> 00:01:02,078
Ben.

31
00:01:02,671 --> 00:01:05,197
Ben, I have to
talk to you about something.

32
00:01:05,648 --> 00:01:09,156
Go ahead. I'm just, uh,
you know, I'm measuring the bed.

33
00:01:09,265 --> 00:01:10,265
Okay.

34
00:01:10,353 --> 00:01:12,015
Uh... here I go.

35
00:01:13,499 --> 00:01:15,750
I... am...

36
00:01:17,281 --> 00:01:18,476
We...

37
00:01:18,588 --> 00:01:21,132
We... are...

38
00:01:21,858 --> 00:01:23,217
pregnant.

39
00:01:28,555 --> 00:01:30,857
<i>We assume a painful backache
or a shaky hand</i>

40
00:01:30,945 --> 00:01:32,937
<i>is something harmless,
random.</i>

41
00:01:33,289 --> 00:01:34,811
But it could be more.

42
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:36,343
Ellis,
eat your cereal.

43
00:01:36,431 --> 00:01:37,851
Where's
your orange vest?

44
00:01:37,939 --> 00:01:39,054
No orange vest today.

45
00:01:39,142 --> 00:01:40,890
The mean judge is making
Mommy go to court

46
00:01:40,978 --> 00:01:42,102
because she's missed
so much work.

47
00:01:42,189 --> 00:01:45,507
So I cannot be late.
Hey, Zola.

48
00:01:45,882 --> 00:01:47,415
Is your head
still hurting you?

49
00:01:47,503 --> 00:01:49,046
My eyes, too.

50
00:01:49,311 --> 00:01:50,615
Really?

51
00:01:50,747 --> 00:01:54,068
- Oh. Okay, sweetie.
- <i>It might be our bodies</i>

52
00:01:54,156 --> 00:01:55,943
<i>reminding us
of what we've endured</i>

53
00:01:56,068 --> 00:01:58,229
<i>and warning us not to let it
happen again.</i>

54
00:01:58,317 --> 00:02:00,180
<i>♪ Yeah, you got
explaining to do ♪</i>

55
00:02:00,268 --> 00:02:01,311
<i>♪ Go on ♪</i>

56
00:02:01,398 --> 00:02:02,643
<i>♪ You got explaining to do ♪</i>

57
00:02:02,731 --> 00:02:04,562
Eyes on the road there, Doctor.

58
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:06,432
Gemma.
You're in awful early.

59
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,205
I could say
you're out awful late.

60
00:02:08,293 --> 00:02:11,736
No, all night surgery.
I cannot wait to crawl into bed.

61
00:02:11,824 --> 00:02:14,869
Oh, and to think
I was gonna get my paycheck

62
00:02:14,957 --> 00:02:16,910
and then
take you to breakfast.

63
00:02:16,998 --> 00:02:18,930
- Um, I should probably...
- Richard Webber,

64
00:02:19,018 --> 00:02:20,609
if the second
half of that sentence

65
00:02:20,697 --> 00:02:22,612
isn't "Grab a stack
of pancakes with you,"

66
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,379
I don't want to hear it.

67
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:28,127
- I am hungry.
- Okay. Stay right here.

68
00:02:28,252 --> 00:02:29,398
- Don't go anywhere.
- Bu...

69
00:02:32,927 --> 00:02:34,916
Okay,
Mr. Wilkerson is stable this morning,

70
00:02:35,004 --> 00:02:36,773
post-op day 1
from his ACDF,

71
00:02:36,861 --> 00:02:38,917
and you also have an aneurysm
coiling this afternoon.

72
00:02:39,004 --> 00:02:40,022
And how are we getting
your girlfriend

73
00:02:40,109 --> 00:02:41,101
to undo the mountain
of damage

74
00:02:41,188 --> 00:02:42,181
she did
with her article?

75
00:02:42,268 --> 00:02:43,861
Well, you'll have to
ask her.

76
00:02:43,953 --> 00:02:45,836
Oh, I see. You think
I put you on my service

77
00:02:45,924 --> 00:02:47,574
because of all the promise
I see in you.

78
00:02:47,662 --> 00:02:48,997
I don't. But I do think
you could talk her

79
00:02:49,084 --> 00:02:50,362
into suing that website
for libel.

80
00:02:50,449 --> 00:02:53,060
Maybe you could withhold sex
until she cracks?

81
00:02:53,148 --> 00:02:54,375
Yeah, that's not
going to work.

82
00:02:54,463 --> 00:02:56,289
What? What?
The sex not good enough?

83
00:02:56,377 --> 00:02:57,775
Are you two on the rocks?

84
00:02:57,932 --> 00:02:59,101
Tom.

85
00:02:59,337 --> 00:03:00,838
I need a CT
for my daughter.

86
00:03:00,926 --> 00:03:02,203
- What's wrong?
- She's been vomiting

87
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:04,096
- and she has a headache.
- Well, it sounds like the flu.

88
00:03:04,183 --> 00:03:06,690
She also has a VP shunt
for spina bifida.

89
00:03:06,778 --> 00:03:08,627
So I need you to get her
in right away, please.

90
00:03:08,715 --> 00:03:09,681
- Okay.
- All right.

91
00:03:09,769 --> 00:03:11,650
Hey, Zola.
Not feeling well?

92
00:03:12,601 --> 00:03:14,604
I read that hyperbaric chambers
were invented

93
00:03:14,692 --> 00:03:16,377
before oxygen was
even discovered.

94
00:03:16,465 --> 00:03:19,878
A British doctor in 1662
used organ bellows

95
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:22,088
to hand-pump air
into an enclosed space.

96
00:03:22,176 --> 00:03:23,690
So cool, right?

97
00:03:24,385 --> 00:03:26,242
I mean, terrible that our
patient needs it.

98
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:28,025
But since she does...
So cool.

99
00:03:28,127 --> 00:03:29,231
What do you need?

100
00:03:29,318 --> 00:03:31,783
Carly Davis,
46-year-old female,

101
00:03:31,871 --> 00:03:35,898
possible suicide attempt,
carbon monoxide poisoning.

102
00:03:35,986 --> 00:03:37,822
Hoping a 90-minute dive
in the chamber

103
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:40,233
can revive her,
although it might take longer.

104
00:03:40,518 --> 00:03:41,938
I know her.

105
00:03:44,518 --> 00:03:45,627
Karev!

106
00:03:45,715 --> 00:03:46,797
You in or out?

107
00:03:46,885 --> 00:03:48,141
In.

108
00:03:48,674 --> 00:03:50,445
All right, Schmitt,
that means you're out.

109
00:03:50,533 --> 00:03:52,432
- But you said I could...
- Goodbye, Schmitt.

110
00:04:03,094 --> 00:04:05,010
Do you think
it's a shunt revision,

111
00:04:05,098 --> 00:04:07,166
or is it just maybe
the flu?

112
00:04:10,871 --> 00:04:12,213
It's just my lawyer
telling me

113
00:04:12,301 --> 00:04:14,514
that I'm supposed to be
in court in 10 minutes.

114
00:04:14,858 --> 00:04:15,851
Don't.

115
00:04:15,938 --> 00:04:17,299
I wasn't gonna
say anything.

116
00:04:17,387 --> 00:04:19,127
How is she?
Is her shunt obstructed?

117
00:04:19,227 --> 00:04:20,510
Oh, goodie.
It's a family affair.

118
00:04:20,598 --> 00:04:21,932
Anyone want to
bring some snacks?

119
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:23,763
Play a rousing game
of UNO?

120
00:04:24,205 --> 00:04:26,391
Oh, and Simon says...

121
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:28,057
enlarged ventricles.

122
00:04:28,145 --> 00:04:29,869
She'll need
a shunt revision.

123
00:04:29,957 --> 00:04:31,171
This is very common
with growth...

124
00:04:31,258 --> 00:04:32,729
I would do it
laparoscopically...

125
00:04:32,824 --> 00:04:35,180
No, I'd do it laparoscopically,
because she's not my niece.

126
00:04:35,268 --> 00:04:36,362
She'll be in and out
in an hour.

127
00:04:36,449 --> 00:04:38,471
Book an OR, DeLukes.

128
00:04:41,711 --> 00:04:43,461
Look, it's a simple
surgery, okay?

129
00:04:43,549 --> 00:04:44,641
You need to go
to court.

130
00:04:44,728 --> 00:04:45,941
I'll be with her
the whole time.

131
00:04:46,028 --> 00:04:47,495
And I'll update you
every step of the way.

132
00:04:47,582 --> 00:04:49,375
- I promise.
- Are you kidding me right now?

133
00:04:49,463 --> 00:04:51,518
Got it. Okay. Yep.
You're not gonna go anywhere.

134
00:04:51,606 --> 00:04:53,180
Okay.
Book an OR, please.

135
00:04:53,268 --> 00:04:54,351
Yep, you got it.

Okay... um, I mean,
absolutely, Dr. Grey.

144

Uh, she's so smart and tough.
She'll be great.

145
00:05:21,236 --> 00:05:22,572
Why are you still
talking?

146
00:05:23,931 --> 00:05:26,070
Hey, it's just gonna be
a quick little nap,

147
00:05:26,158 --> 00:05:28,032
and when you wake up,
you're gonna feel so much better.

148
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:30,141
I know, Mommy.
I pay attention.

149
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:31,805
I'm gonna be right here
the whole time.

150
00:05:31,893 --> 00:05:34,031
And by "right here,"
she means in the waiting room

151
00:05:34,119 --> 00:05:36,736
with the other moms and dads
who don't work here.

152
00:05:37,188 --> 00:05:38,442
Are you scared?

153
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:41,924
You are so brave.

154
00:05:43,581 --> 00:05:44,574
I love you.

155
00:05:44,662 --> 00:05:45,969
- Love you, too.
- Hey.

156
00:05:46,197 --> 00:05:47,266
I've got her.

157
00:05:47,354 --> 00:05:48,557
Let's go.

158
00:05:54,174 --> 00:05:56,705
I can get someone to cover if
you want some company out there.

159
00:05:56,792 --> 00:05:58,562
No. You should be in there
with her.

160
00:05:58,650 --> 00:05:59,916
Okay.

161
00:06:07,322 --> 00:06:09,609
You mean to tell me
you locked yourself in here

162
00:06:09,697 --> 00:06:11,325
with your therapist and you
didn't think that was against...

163
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:13,072
Oh, I don't know...
All the rules?

164
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,905
Technically she was just one
of my therapists

165
00:06:14,992 --> 00:06:16,245
when I was
in residential treatment.

166
00:06:16,332 --> 00:06:17,609
How many did you have?

167
00:06:17,697 --> 00:06:18,854
Three.

168
00:06:18,942 --> 00:06:20,526
Different therapists,
different modalities.

169
00:06:20,613 --> 00:06:22,477
Kind of like when a trauma
comes in and we need to

170
00:06:22,564 --> 00:06:24,318
figure out how many surgeons
we need to send in

171
00:06:24,405 --> 00:06:25,526
from how many different
angles.

172
00:06:25,613 --> 00:06:26,744
Except in your brain.

173
00:06:26,832 --> 00:06:28,096
Yeah, pretty much.

174
00:06:28,307 --> 00:06:29,346
Okay.

175
00:06:31,721 --> 00:06:34,464
Do you know anything
about her medical history?

176
00:06:34,552 --> 00:06:37,635
Anything to indicate why
she would do this?

177
00:06:37,723 --> 00:06:40,426
Uh... all I know is that
she's 13 years sober

178
00:06:40,514 --> 00:06:43,078
and has a serious addiction
to almonds and science fiction.

179
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:44,984
But other than that,
she seemed good.

180
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:46,325
Happy.

181
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:48,674
I just... I don't know
why she would do this.

182
00:06:54,026 --> 00:06:55,729
Dr. Karev,
are you all right?

183
00:06:55,872 --> 00:06:57,706
Yeah, no, she would just...
She would just kill me

184
00:06:57,793 --> 00:07:00,078
because I've forgotten
everything she taught me

185
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:02,058
about how to just, you know,
calm my nervous system.

186
00:07:02,145 --> 00:07:04,968
So if she woke up, she'd be
so pissed at me right now.

187
00:07:06,097 --> 00:07:07,970
So...

188
00:07:08,173 --> 00:07:10,697
I'm guessing the two
of you were close.

189
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,971
I couldn't stand her.
She was the worst.

190
00:07:17,705 --> 00:07:21,947
Let me guess, you're pissed
I'm taking away your pool time.

191
00:07:22,925 --> 00:07:25,088
I already had
Michelle for therapy today,

192
00:07:25,176 --> 00:07:27,664
three hours of group,
and it's fruit punch day,

193
00:07:27,752 --> 00:07:29,127
which is the worst.

194
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:30,498
And now I'm... I'm what?

195
00:07:30,586 --> 00:07:32,367
I'm supposed to stare
at a light bar

196
00:07:32,455 --> 00:07:34,165
and all my troubles
are gonna disappear?

197
00:07:34,518 --> 00:07:36,307
Appendectomies...

198
00:07:36,695 --> 00:07:39,596
pig parts replacing
aortic valves.

199
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,165
And if I read correctly,

200
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:43,455
you put tiny little livers
into mice

201
00:07:43,542 --> 00:07:45,405
'cause the one liver
wasn't working?

202
00:07:47,001 --> 00:07:49,245
I'm just saying
I wanna know the first guy

203
00:07:49,332 --> 00:07:51,510
who said to somebody,
"My brain hurts."

204
00:07:51,635 --> 00:07:53,992
And the other guy was like,
"If I cut it open,

205
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,188
I promise
it'll feel better."

206
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:57,182
And the first guy
was like, "Cool."

207
00:07:57,292 --> 00:07:59,705
But, hey, science.

208
00:08:00,022 --> 00:08:02,994
I get it.
EMDR is just another way

209
00:08:03,082 --> 00:08:04,861
to get at the root
of my trauma.

210
00:08:04,949 --> 00:08:07,284
You spent your media time
looking up EMDR?

211
00:08:07,372 --> 00:08:09,705
Yep. I like to know what
I'm getting into.

212
00:08:09,792 --> 00:08:12,575
In that case, tell me
what it is in under 30 seconds,

213
00:08:12,662 --> 00:08:14,236
I'll let you get
your swim on.

214
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:15,922
Ready?

215
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:17,165
Mm-hmm.
Go.

216
00:08:17,252 --> 00:08:19,557
Eye Movement Desensitization
and Reprocessing.

217
00:08:19,645 --> 00:08:21,614
The lights force bilateral
sensory output,

218
00:08:21,702 --> 00:08:23,392
allowing you to make connections
about your traumas

219
00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:24,745
and desensitize you to them.

220
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:27,111
Aw, so close.

221
00:08:27,306 --> 00:08:29,364
You forgot
it helps to illuminate

222
00:08:29,452 --> 00:08:31,479
the capital "T" trauma
in your life.

223
00:08:31,567 --> 00:08:34,555
I don't have
any capital "T" trauma.

224
00:08:34,643 --> 00:08:36,785
I found out awful news
about how I was born,

225
00:08:36,872 --> 00:08:38,285
and my mother couldn't deal.

226
00:08:38,372 --> 00:08:40,391
I have been
through way worse.

227
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:41,825
You know, if you're gonna eat
in front of me,

228
00:08:41,912 --> 00:08:43,275
could you at least share?

229
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:44,658
No.

230
00:08:44,746 --> 00:08:45,900
Because?

231
00:08:45,988 --> 00:08:48,283
Because boundaries.
I don't share food.

232
00:08:51,877 --> 00:08:53,955
Okay.

233
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:56,065
Deep breath.

234
00:08:56,622 --> 00:08:59,197
You've already established
your safe place with Michelle.

235
00:08:59,285 --> 00:09:01,248
An OR. Any OR.

236
00:09:01,336 --> 00:09:03,664
If this becomes too much,
we can always go back there.

237
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:04,792
Okay?

238
00:09:08,412 --> 00:09:09,785
What's happening for you
right now?

239
00:09:09,872 --> 00:09:11,252
What are you feeling?

240
00:09:13,924 --> 00:09:16,330
Shame. I feel shame.

241
00:09:16,452 --> 00:09:19,955
I feel worthless
that I'm not in an OR.

242
00:09:20,221 --> 00:09:22,019
Is there an image you have
in your mind growing up

243
00:09:22,106 --> 00:09:23,346
that gave you that message?

244
00:09:23,434 --> 00:09:24,481
That you're worthless?

245
00:09:26,089 --> 00:09:28,852
I never spent long enough
in foster homes

246
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:31,143
to remember the wallpaper,
let alone the people.

247
00:09:31,231 --> 00:09:33,570
I had a husband who beat me,
but he's dead now, so...

248
00:09:33,658 --> 00:09:35,018
So no trauma.

249
00:09:36,426 --> 00:09:39,900
Any specific memories or moments
that play over and over?

250
00:09:43,654 --> 00:09:45,994
No, nothing.
It's... I'm... It's nothing.

251
00:09:46,082 --> 00:09:47,245
It's stupid.

252
00:09:47,393 --> 00:09:49,263
Then there's no harm
in telling me.

253
00:09:50,714 --> 00:09:53,282
I reached out my hand
to my mom at a crappy diner,

254
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:54,665
and she pulled away.

255
00:09:55,042 --> 00:09:56,325
She couldn't stand
to touch me.

256
00:09:56,412 --> 00:09:58,930
But it's just... it's so small
compared to everything else,

257
00:09:59,018 --> 00:10:01,213
- so I don't...
- So let's start "small,"

258
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:03,455
- see what happens next.
- Okay?

259
00:10:09,581 --> 00:10:10,994
I shouldn't be
in here with her.

260
00:10:11,082 --> 00:10:13,775
I was doing fine.
I was back at work kicking ass.

261
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:14,972
Everything with Alex
is great.

262
00:10:15,059 --> 00:10:16,212
And then I just...
I screw it all up

263
00:10:16,299 --> 00:10:17,941
by sticking myself in here,
and now I'm...

264
00:10:18,029 --> 00:10:20,010
And now I'm back
to square one.

265
00:10:21,588 --> 00:10:23,605
I need to get out of here.
I need to get out of here.

266
00:10:23,692 --> 00:10:24,945
Dr. Karev,
you know we can't...

267
00:10:25,033 --> 00:10:26,539
I know, I know!
But if the one person

268
00:10:26,627 --> 00:10:28,405
who could help me feel okay
could just go off one day

269
00:10:28,492 --> 00:10:29,236
and try and kill
themselves,

270
00:10:29,324 --> 00:10:30,535
then what does
that say about me?

271
00:10:30,622 --> 00:10:31,665
Huh?

272
00:10:37,792 --> 00:10:39,135
Okay.

273
00:10:39,229 --> 00:10:42,102
Okay. Okay.

274
00:10:42,893 --> 00:10:44,291
Dr. Karev...

275
00:10:45,292 --> 00:10:46,575
Raise the arm
of the patient

276
00:10:46,662 --> 00:10:48,908
and count down to
the 4th intercostal space.

277
00:10:48,996 --> 00:10:50,824
Prep and drape
in sterile fashion.

278
00:10:50,912 --> 00:10:53,406
Then why are you listing the
steps for a chest tube insertion

279
00:10:53,494 --> 00:10:55,531
- if it's not indicated?
- Inject with lidocaine,

280
00:10:55,626 --> 00:10:57,361
make an incision
above the rib.

281
00:10:57,736 --> 00:10:58,824
A Kelly clamp...

282
00:10:58,912 --> 00:11:00,924
Jo, what's going on?
This is supposed to help me.

283
00:11:01,025 --> 00:11:02,097
She's the one who
taught me this.

284
00:11:02,184 --> 00:11:04,594
Feet on the ground,
list the things you know by heart.

285
00:11:04,682 --> 00:11:05,905
It's supposed to trick
your nervous system

286
00:11:05,992 --> 00:11:07,197
into thinking
that you're safe.

287
00:11:07,285 --> 00:11:08,730
But it's not working.
It's not working.

288
00:11:08,817 --> 00:11:10,060
Okay, well, how can I help you?

289
00:11:10,147 --> 00:11:10,814
- What do you need?
- What I need...

290
00:11:10,902 --> 00:11:12,728
I need to think of something else.
I need to think of something else.

291
00:11:12,815 --> 00:11:14,119
I'm pregnant!

292
00:11:15,533 --> 00:11:18,580
100% p-r-e-g-o.

293
00:11:18,908 --> 00:11:20,736
With a live baby...

294
00:11:20,824 --> 00:11:21,751
inside.

295
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,283
Ben's baby. Our baby.
Super pregnant.

296
00:11:26,314 --> 00:11:28,025
Okay, yeah, that worked.

297
00:11:33,926 --> 00:11:37,713
<i>Nurse Potter, 5411.
Nurse Potter, 5411.</i>

298
00:11:47,971 --> 00:11:49,750
Okay.
Everything's good so far.

299
00:11:49,838 --> 00:11:51,643
Koracick just started
the shunt revision.

300
00:11:53,611 --> 00:11:56,266
So, tell me
what we're doing.

301
00:11:56,354 --> 00:11:58,945
Am I walking you
through the surgery

302
00:11:59,033 --> 00:12:00,908
step by step
in real time?

303
00:12:01,236 --> 00:12:05,665
Are we ignoring it altogether
and watching bad TV?

304
00:12:05,893 --> 00:12:09,955
We're sitting in silence,
thinking the worst about Zola.

305
00:12:10,042 --> 00:12:11,158
And about court.

306
00:12:11,246 --> 00:12:13,174
Yeah, I didn't give you
that option.

307
00:12:14,872 --> 00:12:18,908
Derek did a beautiful job
with her shunt the first time.

308
00:12:19,042 --> 00:12:22,102
All Koracick has to do
is go in and revise it.

309
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:24,695
And as someone whose brain
he has poked around in before,

310
00:12:24,783 --> 00:12:26,510
I turned out great.

311
00:12:27,565 --> 00:12:28,932
Tumor-wise.

312
00:12:29,501 --> 00:12:32,324
As for court,
I know absolutely nothing

313
00:12:32,412 --> 00:12:33,783
about the legal system
whatsoever,

314
00:12:33,871 --> 00:12:35,574
so I'm guessing
you are either fine

315
00:12:35,662 --> 00:12:37,752
or locked up for life?

316
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,563
Very helpful, thank you.

317
00:12:40,651 --> 00:12:42,203
I have a very specific set
of skills.

318
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:43,719
- Beyond that, I'm...
- How is she?

319
00:12:43,807 --> 00:12:46,115
Uh, they just got
started on Zola.

320
00:12:46,202 --> 00:12:47,424
She is wallowing.

321
00:12:47,512 --> 00:12:49,596
Not wallowing,
preparing for the worst.

322
00:12:49,691 --> 00:12:51,846
Okay, that's not an option.
Pick another thing.

323
00:12:52,002 --> 00:12:53,312
That's what I said.

324
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,539
I appreciate the two of you
being here, I do,

325
00:12:55,627 --> 00:12:56,847
but I don't need
the distraction.

326
00:12:56,934 --> 00:12:58,927
Yes, you do.
I'll go first.

327
00:12:59,022 --> 00:13:01,969
I just finished
a quadruple valve replacement.

328
00:13:02,057 --> 00:13:04,525
Only two other people in
the U.S. have ever done that,

329
00:13:04,613 --> 00:13:08,856
and I felt more in love
and alive and seen

330
00:13:08,944 --> 00:13:10,222
while my hands were in
that heart

331
00:13:10,309 --> 00:13:12,539
than I did the entire time
I was with Jackson.

332
00:13:12,627 --> 00:13:15,908
There was no endless talking
about feelings, or arguing.

333
00:13:15,996 --> 00:13:17,784
I-I made a plan,
I came in there,

334
00:13:17,872 --> 00:13:19,096
and I did it,
and the rush!

335
00:13:20,191 --> 00:13:22,878
I mean, clearly
I'm still feeling it.

336
00:13:23,715 --> 00:13:25,098
Now you go.

337
00:13:25,276 --> 00:13:28,349
My daughter is in an OR,
and I am abandoning court,

338
00:13:28,437 --> 00:13:29,976
and I might go to jail.

339
00:13:31,963 --> 00:13:33,455
Have we lost her?

340
00:13:35,252 --> 00:13:38,665
And Andrew thought I was
still going to court.

341
00:13:38,752 --> 00:13:40,148
I think he's
just worried that...

342
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:42,018
No, wait,
I'm not even done yet.

343
00:13:42,106 --> 00:13:45,986
First he thought that I would
abandon my child to go to court.

344
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:49,165
And then he offered to skip
the entire surgery

345
00:13:49,252 --> 00:13:52,035
so that he could hold his crying
girlfriend's hand?

346
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:53,165
It's kind.

347
00:13:53,252 --> 00:13:55,165
No, it's incredibly stupid.

348
00:13:55,252 --> 00:13:57,825
Cristina and I would have
mocked him mercilessly

349
00:13:57,912 --> 00:14:00,325
for volunteering to skip out
on a shunt revision

350
00:14:00,412 --> 00:14:02,165
to be someone's
human tissue!

351
00:14:02,252 --> 00:14:04,205
I rescheduled
a spinal decompression.

352
00:14:04,292 --> 00:14:05,615
You're not a resident.

353
00:14:05,702 --> 00:14:08,354
You're not volunteering
to skip surgeries.

354
00:14:09,912 --> 00:14:11,408
For the woman he loves.

355
00:14:11,496 --> 00:14:13,579
Oh, well... well, you know,
when you say it like that,

356
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:14,939
you make me
sound like an ass.

357
00:14:15,027 --> 00:14:16,407
- No.
- Not at all.

358
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,363
He's kind.
He's trying.

359
00:14:20,451 --> 00:14:23,002
But he's not a parent,
and he does not get it.

360
00:14:23,252 --> 00:14:25,018
Okay, so let me get
this straight.

361
00:14:25,106 --> 00:14:27,939
He was wrong to assume
that you would go to court,

362
00:14:28,151 --> 00:14:31,903
but also wrong to support you
while you wait for Zola.

363
00:14:31,991 --> 00:14:33,364
I already said
I sound like an ass.

364
00:14:33,452 --> 00:14:34,535
But...

365
00:14:34,622 --> 00:14:36,455
He's sexy, and he's fun,

366
00:14:36,971 --> 00:14:38,575
and he's so good
to the kids.

367
00:14:38,663 --> 00:14:39,816
But...

368
00:14:39,904 --> 00:14:41,664
I don't know if he'll ever
be more than that.

369
00:14:41,992 --> 00:14:44,166
I don't know
if I want him to be.

370
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:50,952
Oh, they're tunneling
in the new shunt tubing.

371
00:14:53,795 --> 00:14:58,268
Okay, someone say something
that isn't about my stuff.

372
00:14:58,361 --> 00:14:59,535
Uh...

373
00:14:59,622 --> 00:15:03,408
I... don't know
Link's parents' names.

374
00:15:03,496 --> 00:15:07,908
I don't know his taste
in movies or his favorite song

375
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:09,775
or if he actually
likes breakfast for dinner

376
00:15:09,863 --> 00:15:11,936
or just pretends to because
it's all I can make.

377
00:15:12,357 --> 00:15:16,325
And I am having
a baby with him.

378
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:19,029
I am tied to him,
no matter what,

379
00:15:19,117 --> 00:15:21,950
no matter how things go between
us for the rest of my life

380
00:15:22,038 --> 00:15:26,850
because we made a decision
to have a child.

381
00:15:27,372 --> 00:15:28,920
Together.

382
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:32,826
And I will learn
his parents' names eventually.

383
00:15:32,914 --> 00:15:36,747
But, um... I don't know him.

384
00:15:37,537 --> 00:15:42,495
I'm just tying my life to his
"you jump, I jump" style,

385
00:15:42,582 --> 00:15:43,665
which sounds...

386
00:15:43,752 --> 00:15:45,495
Exactly like
what you do.

387
00:15:47,343 --> 00:15:50,574
Okay, I sometimes leap and hope
the net will appear...

388
00:15:50,662 --> 00:15:51,780
Yeah, all the time.

389
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:53,053
I had a brain tumor.

390
00:15:53,141 --> 00:15:55,604
You also have a personality
apart from that tumor.

391
00:15:55,692 --> 00:15:57,270
Which is
a wonderful thing,

392
00:15:57,358 --> 00:16:00,668
and sometimes
it is your Achilles' heel.

393
00:16:01,526 --> 00:16:03,754
We will love you
and that baby

394
00:16:03,872 --> 00:16:05,879
no matter what happens
with Link.

395
00:16:06,347 --> 00:16:09,129
Okay, now it really feels like
it's taking too long.

396
00:16:09,217 --> 00:16:10,887
It's taking too long,
right?

397
00:16:10,975 --> 00:16:12,963
They're probably
confirming the...

398
00:16:13,051 --> 00:16:14,825
Confirming the shunt patency,

399
00:16:14,981 --> 00:16:16,973
which means they should be
almost done.

400
00:16:17,278 --> 00:16:18,824
Okay.

401
00:16:19,504 --> 00:16:20,825
Andrew's a good guy.

402
00:16:20,912 --> 00:16:22,098
We know.

403
00:16:22,209 --> 00:16:23,981
I think I love him.
We know.

404
00:16:24,069 --> 00:16:25,982
We're just at two different
places in our lives,

405
00:16:26,372 --> 00:16:28,922
and I'm just waiting for my gut
to tell me one way or the other.

406
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:30,635
My gut only says yes.

407
00:16:30,815 --> 00:16:33,494
Ever.
Or like 99% of the time.

408
00:16:33,582 --> 00:16:35,905
It just screams yes,
but maybe that's okay

409
00:16:35,992 --> 00:16:38,221
because I like the leap
and having faith,

410
00:16:38,309 --> 00:16:40,432
and if I fall, I learn.

411
00:16:40,528 --> 00:16:43,697
I think surgery
might be my truest love.

412
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:46,144
And I don't think
that's ever gonna change.

413
00:16:46,231 --> 00:16:48,408
And I don't
think it needs to.

414
00:16:50,081 --> 00:16:51,890
This is taking too long.
I'm going in there.

415
00:16:51,978 --> 00:16:52,665
- No.
- No, no.

416
00:16:52,752 --> 00:16:54,518
I know that you want to,
but you can't.

417
00:16:54,611 --> 00:16:57,353
If something were wrong,
they would've definitely...

418
00:16:57,441 --> 00:16:59,127
My gut is telling me
something is wrong.

419
00:16:59,215 --> 00:17:01,588
Have you seen my life?
The people that I've lost?

420
00:17:01,676 --> 00:17:04,169
Until someone comes in here
and tells me otherwise...

421
00:17:04,257 --> 00:17:05,265
Come here.

422
00:17:06,254 --> 00:17:07,807
They should be closing up
any minute now,

423
00:17:07,894 --> 00:17:10,148
and I am sure they went in
through a part in her hair

424
00:17:10,236 --> 00:17:11,364
so she won't even
see a scar.

425
00:17:12,785 --> 00:17:15,180
Dr. Grey, she's out of surgery
and she's...

426
00:17:15,268 --> 00:17:16,664
She's perfect,
I'm perfect.

427
00:17:16,752 --> 00:17:18,086
You can see her
when she gets out of post-op.

428
00:17:18,336 --> 00:17:19,939
Thank you, Tom.
Thank you. Yeah.

429
00:17:20,152 --> 00:17:21,185
Yeah, a-and...

430
00:17:21,304 --> 00:17:22,719
But not before that,
alright?

431
00:17:22,807 --> 00:17:24,398
Okay. Thank you, Tom.

432
00:17:25,372 --> 00:17:26,648
Thank you.

433
00:17:28,162 --> 00:17:29,320
Will you stay
with her, please?

434
00:17:29,407 --> 00:17:30,650
- Of course.
- Okay.

435
00:17:33,301 --> 00:17:35,134
Go.

436
00:17:35,572 --> 00:17:38,619
She's good!

437
00:17:45,413 --> 00:17:47,164
I am serious.

438
00:17:47,252 --> 00:17:50,197
He is a CPA
that counts on his fingers,

439
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,283
and he had the nerve
to give me grief

440
00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:54,330
for leaving the office
15 minutes early...

441
00:17:54,418 --> 00:17:56,055
My work already done.

442
00:17:56,143 --> 00:17:57,535
I'd expect nothing less.

443
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:01,047
He's an idiot.

444
00:18:01,135 --> 00:18:03,035
But it pays the bills.

445
00:18:03,267 --> 00:18:05,074
And for that,
I have to thank you.

446
00:18:05,162 --> 00:18:06,471
I just told the truth.

447
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:08,619
That I'm a pain in the ass,
but great with deadlines?

448
00:18:08,706 --> 00:18:09,955
I softened it a bit.

449
00:18:10,043 --> 00:18:13,204
Well, I have a lot to thank you
for, not just that job.

450
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:14,955
Well, you would've done
the same for me.

451
00:18:15,111 --> 00:18:16,524
Damn straight.

452
00:18:16,642 --> 00:18:18,346
But if you had shown up
on my doorstep

453
00:18:18,434 --> 00:18:19,677
with a heel in your heart,

454
00:18:19,918 --> 00:18:21,252
you would've been
crap out of luck.

455
00:18:23,908 --> 00:18:27,346
So, um, how's
the sponsor search going?

456
00:18:28,596 --> 00:18:30,333
It's slim pickings out there.

457
00:18:30,452 --> 00:18:34,182
Everyone at our meetings
is either angry old people

458
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:38,723
or Millennials who wear spikes
of driftwood as earrings.

459
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:40,698
I don't know, just maybe
try some other meetings.

460
00:18:40,785 --> 00:18:43,197
Oh, it's... It takes some time
to find the right one.

461
00:18:43,331 --> 00:18:45,845
Well, you know I've never
been one to settle down.

462
00:18:45,933 --> 00:18:47,183
Mm-hmm.

463
00:18:48,403 --> 00:18:51,445
Except for Ollie.
Ollie was the exception.

464
00:18:51,673 --> 00:18:53,025
Yes, she was.

465
00:18:53,377 --> 00:18:54,853
- But...
- Hmm?

466
00:18:54,941 --> 00:18:56,566
If I wanted to talk AA,

467
00:18:56,654 --> 00:18:58,981
I'd be in AA.

468
00:19:00,872 --> 00:19:02,963
- How about you?
- Hmm?

469
00:19:03,064 --> 00:19:04,995
Tell me about you.

470
00:19:05,373 --> 00:19:07,179
Uh, well... well...

471
00:19:07,267 --> 00:19:08,351
I'm... I'm fine.

472
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:12,148
The... hospital isn't up to snuff,
but, uh, it's getting there.

473
00:19:12,374 --> 00:19:13,700
Oh, please,

474
00:19:13,788 --> 00:19:15,867
we work at the same hospital.

475
00:19:15,955 --> 00:19:17,197
And Catherine?

476
00:19:17,296 --> 00:19:19,687
Uh...
she's getting there, too.

477
00:19:19,775 --> 00:19:22,249
Now tell me
how this works again

478
00:19:22,337 --> 00:19:25,747
when she's out of the state more
often than she is in your bed.

479
00:19:25,867 --> 00:19:27,085
Gemma.

480
00:19:27,262 --> 00:19:29,990
What, you want to take
the South out of me, too?

481
00:19:30,078 --> 00:19:31,325
I already quit drinking.

482
00:19:33,607 --> 00:19:34,976
You know...

483
00:19:35,255 --> 00:19:37,418
Catherine and I
like to fight.

484
00:19:37,661 --> 00:19:39,812
Part of what I love
most about her

485
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:43,148
is her... her passion,
her fire.

486
00:19:43,562 --> 00:19:46,615
But it's like the...
The light's gone out,

487
00:19:46,702 --> 00:19:49,632
and I... I don't know
how to get it back, you know?

488
00:19:51,343 --> 00:19:54,365
You have the biggest heart
I've ever known, Richard.

489
00:19:54,959 --> 00:19:59,226
Catherine may be too wrapped up
in her own head

490
00:19:59,554 --> 00:20:01,859
to see that right now.

491
00:20:02,447 --> 00:20:06,161
When my mother died,
the first thing I thought,

492
00:20:06,249 --> 00:20:09,455
and I was a kid...
Was that my father's

493
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:13,285
never gonna have that love,
sitting on that porch

494
00:20:13,372 --> 00:20:15,905
beside him,
the rest of his life.

495
00:20:16,203 --> 00:20:18,365
See, when my girlfriends

496
00:20:18,452 --> 00:20:20,570
would throw pillowcases
on their heads

497
00:20:20,658 --> 00:20:22,111
as veils,

498
00:20:22,199 --> 00:20:25,163
They was like,
"This was the best day of my life."

499
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:31,265
I thought the only thing better
than one man to love you...

500
00:20:31,445 --> 00:20:33,054
is a rotation.

501
00:20:34,554 --> 00:20:37,825
I've... never been that.

502
00:20:38,226 --> 00:20:39,546
Ohh.

503
00:20:42,662 --> 00:20:46,476
<i>♪ Ooh, ooh ♪</i>

504
00:20:46,622 --> 00:20:49,310
- <i>♪ I don't need nobody ♪</i>
- Ah.

505
00:20:49,398 --> 00:20:50,982
<i>♪ I don't need no one ♪</i>

506
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:52,953
Now, why would you
pull away

507
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:56,534
from the first little bit
of comfort

508
00:20:56,622 --> 00:20:57,955
that you've had in weeks?

509
00:20:58,043 --> 00:21:00,279
Because I'm a married man.

510
00:21:00,367 --> 00:21:02,710
I am fully aware
that you and Catherine

511
00:21:02,798 --> 00:21:05,499
have rings on your fingers
for better or worse.

512
00:21:05,587 --> 00:21:09,920
Forgive me for thinking that
because you have hit the worst,

513
00:21:10,059 --> 00:21:11,972
that you may be,
you know...

514
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:13,656
looking around.

515
00:21:14,679 --> 00:21:16,286
And don't insult me
by pretending

516
00:21:16,374 --> 00:21:17,602
you don't know
what I'm talking about.

517
00:21:17,689 --> 00:21:18,813
Because I've known you too well

518
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,373
for too long.

519
00:21:21,818 --> 00:21:23,065
I love my wife.

520
00:21:23,153 --> 00:21:27,437
I have no intentions of
competing with Catherine Fox.

521
00:21:28,265 --> 00:21:30,929
Y'all are having a hard time.
You'll find your way back.

522
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:32,865
But in the meantime...

523
00:21:32,952 --> 00:21:34,499
you're miserable,

524
00:21:35,042 --> 00:21:36,460
and I'm here,

525
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:41,617
and life is too short
to deprive ourselves

526
00:21:41,705 --> 00:21:43,960
of what we've been feeling
for so many years.

527
00:21:45,326 --> 00:21:47,490
You know, I think you've
mistaken my friendship

528
00:21:47,578 --> 00:21:48,898
for something else
entirely.

529
00:21:48,986 --> 00:21:50,953
And if you think this is
just friendship,

530
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:53,771
than you're as dumb as that man
who counts on his hands.

531
00:21:53,859 --> 00:21:55,785
<i>♪ Barely 17 ♪</i>

532
00:21:55,872 --> 00:21:57,365
<i>♪ Learned it then that
a good man gonna do you wrong ♪</i>

533
00:21:57,452 --> 00:21:59,285
Okay, um...

534
00:21:59,476 --> 00:22:02,495
if I've done anything
to mislead you, Gemma,

535
00:22:02,582 --> 00:22:04,406
okay, I apologize.

536
00:22:04,662 --> 00:22:07,531
But, uh, there is
nothing between us,

537
00:22:07,662 --> 00:22:09,035
and there never has been.

538
00:22:09,122 --> 00:22:10,430
♪ 'Cause it ain't a lesson,
you can take it from me ♪

539
00:22:10,517 --> 00:22:13,562
Well, suit yourself,
but if history serves,

540
00:22:13,702 --> 00:22:15,745
when hard times hit,
you bury yourself

541
00:22:15,832 --> 00:22:18,124
in a bottle of vodka
or another woman.

542
00:22:18,372 --> 00:22:21,013
And we both know which one
you can handle.

543
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:32,583
Are you really
going to just walk away

544
00:22:32,671 --> 00:22:34,038
after what we felt
in there?

545
00:22:34,126 --> 00:22:36,271
All that talk about
rigorous honesty.

546
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:38,609
I'm in love with Catherine.
My wife.

547
00:22:38,697 --> 00:22:40,650
And you're in love
with Adele, too.

548
00:22:40,741 --> 00:22:43,864
Until there was Ellis Grey,
and then it was back to Adele,

549
00:22:43,952 --> 00:22:46,943
and when she lay in that home
dying of Alzheimer's,

550
00:22:47,031 --> 00:22:47,843
who were you with?

551
00:22:47,931 --> 00:22:49,693
I tried to visit Adele
all the time.

552
00:22:49,781 --> 00:22:50,828
It only upset her.

553
00:22:50,916 --> 00:22:53,575
And whose arms
did you fall into then?

554
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:54,859
Catherine.

555
00:22:55,042 --> 00:22:56,685
Just because you know
my history

556
00:22:56,773 --> 00:22:58,045
doesn't mean you can
use it against me

557
00:22:58,132 --> 00:23:00,075
to make yourself
less lonely.

558
00:23:00,366 --> 00:23:01,384
Richard!

559
00:23:01,495 --> 00:23:03,368
Call your sponsor.
Get a meeting.

560
00:23:03,542 --> 00:23:05,245
That was
not sober behavior.

561
00:23:29,179 --> 00:23:31,164
Oh, go ahead,
get it over with.

562
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:33,249
How are you feeling?

563
00:23:33,337 --> 00:23:34,994
How's Ben feeling?
Was it planned?

564
00:23:35,082 --> 00:23:37,013
Don't know,
doesn't know yet,

565
00:23:37,101 --> 00:23:38,101
and hell no.

566
00:23:38,296 --> 00:23:40,995
Uh... her A.B.G is better.

567
00:23:41,082 --> 00:23:43,745
She's less acidotic,
and CO level is down.

568
00:23:43,832 --> 00:23:45,249
She should be
awake up by now.

569
00:23:49,145 --> 00:23:51,927
It's okay to admit
if you're feeling scared.

570
00:23:52,015 --> 00:23:53,904
What happens
in the hyperbaric chamber

571
00:23:53,992 --> 00:23:55,257
stays in
the hyperbaric chamber.

572
00:23:55,345 --> 00:23:56,849
- I'm not scared.
- Okay.

573
00:23:56,937 --> 00:24:00,437
I'm... surprised.

574
00:24:02,637 --> 00:24:05,671
Tuck is the light
of my life,

575
00:24:05,832 --> 00:24:08,325
but I thought I was done
with diapers and strollers.

576
00:24:08,412 --> 00:24:10,905
Now there's all
these new diapers with wings

577
00:24:10,992 --> 00:24:12,953
and strollers that can
practically fly to the moon.

578
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:15,661
And I think I...
could be happy.

579
00:24:15,749 --> 00:24:17,507
I might be happy...

580
00:24:18,128 --> 00:24:20,328
but out-of-my-mind
terrified.

581
00:24:20,436 --> 00:24:22,255
And terrified.

582
00:24:22,343 --> 00:24:23,999
It's a therapy thing.

583
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:25,954
You listed all
these positive feelings

584
00:24:26,042 --> 00:24:27,785
and then you said "but"
as if being terrified

585
00:24:27,872 --> 00:24:29,321
erased everything that
you said prior,

586
00:24:29,408 --> 00:24:33,609
but the happy, the terror,
it's all true.

587
00:24:36,062 --> 00:24:37,648
Well, I don't like it.

588
00:24:49,773 --> 00:24:51,171
Right on time.

589
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:52,745
What?

590
00:24:53,319 --> 00:24:55,599
What are you,
stalking me?

591
00:24:55,687 --> 00:24:56,905
Nah.

592
00:24:57,226 --> 00:24:58,786
Therapists
rotate every night.

593
00:24:58,874 --> 00:25:00,367
There's always a runner.

594
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,249
I figured after our session

595
00:25:02,337 --> 00:25:04,710
this afternoon,
odds were on you.

596
00:25:05,117 --> 00:25:09,328
Besides, I like staring
at the stars for funzies.

597
00:25:09,546 --> 00:25:11,560
I don't want to run.

598
00:25:11,648 --> 00:25:12,742
It doesn't make
any sense.

599
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:15,060
I feel shame over things
I didn't even do,

600
00:25:15,148 --> 00:25:16,535
things
that were done to me.

601
00:25:16,702 --> 00:25:19,976
That's...
all I can feel.

602
00:25:21,694 --> 00:25:23,029
Yep.

603
00:25:25,872 --> 00:25:27,325
Is that all
you're gonna say?

604
00:25:27,413 --> 00:25:29,460
Well, technically,
I'm off the clock.

605
00:25:32,631 --> 00:25:35,034
You're used to being
exceptional.

606
00:25:35,249 --> 00:25:38,405
Right now, you're just like
everybody else here mentally.

607
00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:41,716
You're stuck,
can't see past the one moment

608
00:25:41,827 --> 00:25:43,718
that's defining
your entire life.

609
00:25:44,831 --> 00:25:46,994
You mean the moment
where I watched my mom

610
00:25:47,082 --> 00:25:49,210
walk away from me
in a diner?

611
00:25:50,492 --> 00:25:51,890
No.

612
00:25:52,796 --> 00:25:54,218
Then what?

613
00:25:56,656 --> 00:25:58,312
For you.

614
00:25:58,502 --> 00:26:00,171
Purple juice day.

615
00:26:01,382 --> 00:26:03,101
Best day ever.

616
00:26:07,367 --> 00:26:10,968
Okay.
Okay, boundaries.

617
00:26:12,585 --> 00:26:14,966
If you could move through
that fear and that shame

618
00:26:15,054 --> 00:26:16,411
and let yourself
feel angry...

619
00:26:16,499 --> 00:26:18,085
I can't.

620
00:26:19,554 --> 00:26:23,781
Which means
I'll be stuck here forever.

621
00:26:28,124 --> 00:26:29,554
Yep.

622
00:26:33,207 --> 00:26:35,890
Tuck's childhood
bedtime routine. Go.

623
00:26:36,448 --> 00:26:38,413
Okay, uh...

624
00:26:38,621 --> 00:26:41,466
uh, bath, diaper, PJs,

625
00:26:41,554 --> 00:26:43,165
a glass of milk,
brush your teeth,

626
00:26:43,252 --> 00:26:44,906
one book,
out like a light...

627
00:26:44,994 --> 00:26:48,404
But then when he got older
and we'd finished the book,

628
00:26:48,492 --> 00:26:50,491
all of a sudden, he needed
to go back to the bathroom...

629
00:26:50,578 --> 00:26:52,745
Just stick to the baby routine.
Again.

630
00:26:52,832 --> 00:26:53,854
Baby routine, okay.

631
00:26:53,942 --> 00:26:58,065
Uh, bath, diaper, PJs,
glass of milk,

632
00:26:58,153 --> 00:27:00,856
brush your teeth,
one book, out like a light.

633
00:27:00,973 --> 00:27:04,054
One more time.
Bath, diaper, PJs,

634
00:27:04,162 --> 00:27:06,578
a glass of milk,
brush your teeth,

635
00:27:06,872 --> 00:27:09,624
one book, out like a light.

636
00:27:14,265 --> 00:27:17,749
I swear to God, Karev,
next time I go on sabbatical,

637
00:27:17,837 --> 00:27:18,914
I'm going wherever
the hell you went.

638
00:27:19,001 --> 00:27:20,611
You learned
all the things.

639
00:27:20,714 --> 00:27:23,320
I learned it all from her.

640
00:27:25,726 --> 00:27:27,507
- Oh!
- Oh, she's seizing.

641
00:27:27,631 --> 00:27:28,964
Okay.

642
00:27:29,052 --> 00:27:30,608
Damn, I thought
she was getting better!

643
00:27:30,696 --> 00:27:33,819
Her labs are fine.
I can't tell why...

644
00:27:35,662 --> 00:27:37,512
She doesn't share food.

645
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,973
The almonds she was
always eating.

646
00:27:39,061 --> 00:27:40,075
What if she's diabetic?

647
00:27:40,163 --> 00:27:41,357
What was her glucose
when she came in?

648
00:27:41,444 --> 00:27:44,007
Uh...

649
00:27:44,451 --> 00:27:48,333
78, which is low normal,
but the hyperbaric therapy...

650
00:27:48,421 --> 00:27:50,705
Is using the glucose to
metabolize the oxygen.

651
00:27:50,792 --> 00:27:52,035
- D-50!
- D-50!

652
00:27:54,992 --> 00:27:56,544
Okay, Carly, here we go.

653
00:27:56,632 --> 00:27:58,491
Alright.

654
00:27:59,122 --> 00:28:00,825
Now.
Okay.

655
00:28:07,639 --> 00:28:09,495
Carly, it's Jo.
Can you hear me?

656
00:28:19,325 --> 00:28:22,139
You're good. You're okay.
It's okay.

657
00:28:22,235 --> 00:28:24,507
I'm here.
You're okay.

658
00:28:30,796 --> 00:28:32,380
I'm pissed now, okay?

659
00:28:32,468 --> 00:28:33,880
Are you happy?

660
00:28:33,968 --> 00:28:36,380
Good morning, Carly.
Do you have a few minutes to talk?

661
00:28:36,468 --> 00:28:38,723
10 sessions with you
and that dumb-ass light bar.

662
00:28:38,811 --> 00:28:41,216
Not really fair to take it out
on the light bar, but okay.

663
00:28:41,304 --> 00:28:43,700
I hate everything!
My mom.

664
00:28:43,788 --> 00:28:45,067
My rapist dad, Paul.

665
00:28:45,155 --> 00:28:47,489
The fact that I'm here staring
at the same image of my mom

666
00:28:47,577 --> 00:28:50,630
pulling away from me in a diner
over and over and over again,

667
00:28:50,718 --> 00:28:52,741
and never moving past it.

668
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:56,083
And that. You know what?
I'm adding that to the list,

669
00:28:56,171 --> 00:28:58,271
the fact that I'm in pain and
you're treating it like a joke.

670
00:28:58,358 --> 00:29:00,481
This isn't a joke.
It's a breakthrough.

671
00:29:00,569 --> 00:29:01,934
You're finally allowing
yourself

672
00:29:02,022 --> 00:29:04,716
to move past your fear and
the shame and into the anger.

673
00:29:04,804 --> 00:29:05,815
This is progress.

674
00:29:05,902 --> 00:29:08,231
Okay,
I can't... be angry.

675
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:09,255
Why not?

676
00:29:09,343 --> 00:29:11,489
Because if I start being angry,
I will never stop,

677
00:29:11,577 --> 00:29:14,077
and then I'm Paul.
I'm no better than him.

678
00:29:14,537 --> 00:29:17,358
That's because you don't know
what healthy anger looks like.

679
00:29:18,255 --> 00:29:21,825
No, no, no. I'm not...
I c... I can't do EMDR today.

680
00:29:21,913 --> 00:29:23,747
I'm not doing it.
I know it's... life-changing

681
00:29:23,835 --> 00:29:26,249
or whatever, but just,
I can't, not today.

682
00:29:27,077 --> 00:29:31,169
Hi, I'm Carly, and my core
feeling today is pride

683
00:29:31,257 --> 00:29:33,364
because my patient asked for
what she needed

684
00:29:33,452 --> 00:29:35,889
for the first time
in 22 days.

685
00:29:44,155 --> 00:29:45,475
What's happening?

686
00:29:45,689 --> 00:29:47,468
I'm throwing crap
at a wall.

687
00:29:49,458 --> 00:29:51,098
Care to join me?

688
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:57,059
Are we both
consenting adults?

689
00:29:57,147 --> 00:29:58,200
Yep.

690
00:29:58,288 --> 00:30:01,294
Are we okay if we agree
to throw things at walls...

691
00:30:01,382 --> 00:30:03,772
..not people...
just the walls?

692
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:04,950
Yep.

693
00:30:05,061 --> 00:30:07,991
Right there.
That's what makes you not Paul.

694
00:30:08,186 --> 00:30:11,616
Because you can feel anger while
controlling your behavior.

695
00:30:15,116 --> 00:30:16,905
Throw first, judge later.

696
00:30:17,513 --> 00:30:18,858
Okay.

697
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:28,278
Remind me not to
pick you first

698
00:30:28,366 --> 00:30:29,631
if we ever start
a trauma league.

699
00:30:31,294 --> 00:30:32,843
Give me a minute.

00:30:36,333 --> 00:30:41,863

<i>♪ Lose yourself

705
00:31:04,113 --> 00:31:06,702
I'm gonna go off script here
and admit something.

706
00:31:09,521 --> 00:31:12,944
I used to be the on-call
social worker for Safe Haven.

707
00:31:13,846 --> 00:31:16,249
Moms and dads would drop
their babies off

708
00:31:16,341 --> 00:31:18,491
at fire stations,
and I would get the call.

709
00:31:18,949 --> 00:31:21,968
And no matter how fast I drove,
by the time I got there,

710
00:31:22,709 --> 00:31:25,240
that baby would be wrapped
in a warm blanket,

711
00:31:26,128 --> 00:31:29,952
in some firefighter's arms,
a crowd around it.

712
00:31:31,123 --> 00:31:33,007
Why are you
telling me this?

713
00:31:33,991 --> 00:31:35,434
You were five days old

714
00:31:35,522 --> 00:31:37,616
when your mother
abandoned you.

715
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,772
Your brain may
not have a memory

716
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:42,483
of her pulling her hand away
from you, but your body does.

717
00:31:46,417 --> 00:31:49,569
And your body felt the same way
in that diner

718
00:31:50,014 --> 00:31:52,764
when she pulled away
and left you... Alone.

719
00:31:52,971 --> 00:31:55,544
<i>♪ Fall into my shadow ♪</i>

720
00:31:55,733 --> 00:31:57,686
It's why it hurt so much.

721
00:32:00,788 --> 00:32:02,484
- <i>♪ Use me 'til</i> there's nothing left ♪
- Your body felt the same way

722
00:32:02,571 --> 00:32:04,991
it did when you were a baby,
all over again.

723
00:32:09,387 --> 00:32:11,778
<i>♪ Every night's a war, ♪</i>

724
00:32:11,866 --> 00:32:15,080
- <i>♪ and love's a battle ♪</i>
- And

725
00:32:15,168 --> 00:32:17,327
you were
surrounded by love.

726
00:32:17,422 --> 00:32:20,175
<i>♪ Lose yourself

727
00:32:20,262 --> 00:32:21,505
Still are.

<i>♪ Lose yourself

729
00:32:33,676 --> 00:32:36,293
Now, if you want to go home
and take care of yourself,

730
00:32:36,381 --> 00:32:37,871
I can do this part.

731
00:32:38,092 --> 00:32:41,005
No. I should be
the one to tell her.

732
00:32:41,092 --> 00:32:43,095
All right, well, I'll be right
out there if you need me.

733
00:32:48,309 --> 00:32:52,330
Today I watched you
teeter on that edge,

734
00:32:52,425 --> 00:32:56,237
bring yourself back...
by yourself, bring me back...

735
00:32:56,449 --> 00:32:58,795
And save someone else's life
in the process.

736
00:32:58,882 --> 00:33:01,545
I don't know
what "square one" looks like,

737
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:03,925
but there was nothing
square one about that.

738
00:33:18,098 --> 00:33:19,925
You're giving me
that death look.

739
00:33:20,012 --> 00:33:21,533
I don't have a death look.

740
00:33:21,621 --> 00:33:23,236
You did whenever
I gave you homework,

741
00:33:23,324 --> 00:33:25,080
told you something
you didn't want to hear.

742
00:33:25,168 --> 00:33:26,878
It's just my face.

743
00:33:29,621 --> 00:33:31,512
You had carbon monoxide
poisoning.

744
00:33:31,684 --> 00:33:34,346
You had a seizure because
your blood sugar bottomed out,

745
00:33:34,434 --> 00:33:37,095
but we were able to bring it
back up and oxygenate you.

746
00:33:37,182 --> 00:33:39,501
And in theory, you should be
well enough to go home tomorrow.

747
00:33:39,588 --> 00:33:41,041
In theory?

748
00:33:41,684 --> 00:33:44,098
You know that I have to call
psych now.

749
00:33:44,574 --> 00:33:46,822
I don't want to,
but it's the law...

750
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:48,947
All suicide attempts
have to be reported...

751
00:33:49,035 --> 00:33:50,715
Suicide attempt?

752
00:33:50,988 --> 00:33:52,215
Hold up.

753
00:33:52,778 --> 00:33:56,400
One minute, I was 200 pages in
to the newest Margaret Atwood,

754
00:33:56,488 --> 00:33:57,848
curled up
next to my heater,

755
00:33:57,936 --> 00:34:00,549
the next I'm in some space
chamber in the hospital.

756
00:34:00,757 --> 00:34:02,192
You didn't do this
on purpose?

757
00:34:02,301 --> 00:34:03,348
Never again.

758
00:34:03,436 --> 00:34:04,939
You were in your home.

759
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:08,010
Well, I wasn't in my garage
with a locked door,

760
00:34:08,098 --> 00:34:09,635
a note,
and a death wish.

761
00:34:09,722 --> 00:34:12,074
If you want to 5150 me
for forgetting to change

762
00:34:12,162 --> 00:34:14,299
the batteries in
my CO detector, that's fair

763
00:34:14,387 --> 00:34:15,768
because that thing's
been out for months,

764
00:34:15,855 --> 00:34:18,239
and I... I could've died.

765
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:25,900
Thanks for
not letting me die.

766
00:34:29,551 --> 00:34:31,410
- Breathe.
- I'm breathing.

767
00:34:31,785 --> 00:34:33,047
Her chemistries
are stable,

768
00:34:33,135 --> 00:34:35,090
but should I get
an endocrine consult?

769
00:34:35,871 --> 00:34:37,574
Um...

770
00:34:41,472 --> 00:34:43,005
Carly...

771
00:34:43,092 --> 00:34:45,285
I can't be
your doctor anymore.

772
00:34:45,373 --> 00:34:47,479
I never should've been
in the first place.

773
00:34:47,567 --> 00:34:50,822
So Dr. Bailey
will take good care of you.

774
00:34:52,923 --> 00:34:54,166
What?

775
00:34:54,254 --> 00:34:55,885
Boundaries.

776
00:34:56,246 --> 00:34:58,768
Looks like somebody learned
something after all.

777
00:35:05,184 --> 00:35:07,004
Okay.

778
00:35:09,632 --> 00:35:11,707
Oh, you're home.

779
00:35:11,801 --> 00:35:14,335
Yes, I am home.

780
00:35:18,011 --> 00:35:19,793
You worked
all night again?

781
00:35:19,887 --> 00:35:21,442
Yeah, I did.

782
00:35:22,382 --> 00:35:26,835
I went to breakfast, then, uh,
I came back here to lie down.

783
00:35:26,922 --> 00:35:29,457
I guess I slept all day.

784
00:35:34,722 --> 00:35:36,106
How was your trip?

785
00:35:37,894 --> 00:35:39,934
Same as it always is.

786
00:35:42,222 --> 00:35:44,295
You look tired, Richard.

787
00:35:44,515 --> 00:35:46,105
I am, Catherine.

788
00:35:47,425 --> 00:35:49,074
I really am.

789
00:35:52,782 --> 00:35:54,372
Go back to sleep.

790
00:36:25,154 --> 00:36:26,941
I came as fast as I could.
What's... What's going on?

791
00:36:27,028 --> 00:36:28,110
What's... Is...
Are you okay?

792
00:36:28,197 --> 00:36:29,793
Is... Is Tuck okay?

793
00:36:31,706 --> 00:36:34,129
Oh, okay,
so not an emergency.

794
00:36:34,217 --> 00:36:35,605
Well... Well, can we talk
about it over dinner?

795
00:36:35,692 --> 00:36:36,965
Because I'm starving,

796
00:36:37,053 --> 00:36:38,582
and that...
That tandoori chicken

797
00:36:38,682 --> 00:36:40,590
at Monsoon on Main
is calling my na...

798
00:36:40,678 --> 00:36:42,067
I'm pregnant!

799
00:36:44,918 --> 00:36:46,255
But... you...

800
00:36:46,342 --> 00:36:47,473
you...

801
00:36:47,574 --> 00:36:49,737
y-you said were
going through menopause.

802
00:36:49,825 --> 00:36:53,424
Turns out a lot can be true
at the same time.

803
00:36:56,887 --> 00:36:58,504
It's crazy, right?

804
00:36:58,592 --> 00:37:03,153
And I know, we've...
We've never talked about this,

805
00:37:03,262 --> 00:37:06,385
but I've been thinking
about how much more prepared

806
00:37:06,472 --> 00:37:08,731
I am now compared to
when I had Tuck.

807
00:37:08,819 --> 00:37:11,158
I was just a resident.
I thought I knew everything,

808
00:37:11,246 --> 00:37:13,949
but basically knew,
uh, nothing.

809
00:37:14,176 --> 00:37:17,253
But now I've got mad skills,
nothing can stop me,

810
00:37:17,341 --> 00:37:20,464
and I kind of think
this might be great

811
00:37:20,552 --> 00:37:24,595
and something that we'll
have... together. Right?

812
00:37:24,682 --> 00:37:28,424
Or... mm, am I wrong?

813
00:37:28,512 --> 00:37:31,285
Um, and it's okay
if I'm...

814
00:37:31,512 --> 00:37:33,387
if, uh...

815
00:37:33,556 --> 00:37:35,589
I'm sorry. Uh...

816
00:37:35,677 --> 00:37:37,840
I've just been spinning all day
waiting to tell you,

817
00:37:37,935 --> 00:37:39,263
and then I got stuck
in the chamber...

818
00:37:39,350 --> 00:37:41,383
Oh, we're having a baby!!

819
00:37:41,471 --> 00:37:43,430
Y-Yes.

820
00:37:43,518 --> 00:37:47,387
Oh, and nausea is a classic
symptom of pregnancy...

821
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:49,413

00:39:51,681 --> 00:39:53,044
- Okay.
- Okay.

875
00:39:53,132 --> 00:39:54,530
I'll be right back.

876
00:39:57,092 --> 00:39:58,929
- Hey.
- Hey. How's she doing?

877
00:39:59,017 --> 00:40:00,155
She's fully recovered.

878
00:40:00,243 --> 00:40:02,702
She's asking for Jell-O,
so I'm on a hunt.

- Thank you.

00:40:07,959 --> 00:40:09,272
How are you doing?

882
00:40:09,538 --> 00:40:11,755
I'm glad
Zola's okay.

883
00:40:11,843 --> 00:40:13,632
Good.
Nancy.

884
00:40:14,042 --> 00:40:16,044
"The girl who cried
medical emergency."

885
00:40:16,132 --> 00:40:17,390
That's what the judge
called you.

886
00:40:17,477 --> 00:40:19,430
- How's your daughter?
- Much better, thank you.

887
00:40:19,518 --> 00:40:21,725
She had to have neurosurgery,
so I couldn't leave her.

888
00:40:21,813 --> 00:40:23,873
I get that. But sadly, you're
going to have to leave her,

889
00:40:23,961 --> 00:40:25,095
along with the rest of
your children

890
00:40:25,182 --> 00:40:26,732
while you make up
for your missed hours.

891
00:40:26,819 --> 00:40:29,859
I was able to squeeze a small
drop of humanity from the judge.

892
00:40:29,956 --> 00:40:32,731
Thank you.
I will be at trash duty first thing,

893
00:40:32,835 --> 00:40:34,835
and no more excuses,
as soon as she's sent home.

894
00:40:34,922 --> 00:40:37,725
Dr. Grey, you're not going back
to clean-up duty.

895
00:40:37,874 --> 00:40:40,194
You'll be making up
your missed hours in jail.

896
00:40:40,536 --> 00:40:43,372
And prepares us for whatever
fight lies ahead.
