Hey.
You're back.

14
00:00:23,968 --> 00:00:25,751
Are you still drunk?

15
00:00:25,846 --> 00:00:27,179
No.

16
00:00:27,266 --> 00:00:28,816
Are you nervous?

17
00:00:28,976 --> 00:00:30,480
No. Are you?

18
00:00:30,636 --> 00:00:32,599
I was, but I snuck in
and did two lap choles

19
00:00:32,686 --> 00:00:34,607
before breakfast, so...

20
00:00:34,766 --> 00:00:37,299
- Welcome back.
- Hey.

21
00:00:37,386 --> 00:00:40,429
Have either one of you seen
a package at the house?

22
00:00:40,516 --> 00:00:41,550
What package?

23
00:00:41,638 --> 00:00:43,285
Well, Cristina was
sending something...

24
00:00:43,373 --> 00:00:45,237
You know, "Congratulations
on not becoming a drifter

25
00:00:45,324 --> 00:00:47,099
slash getting dumped
by a resident" present...

26
00:00:47,186 --> 00:00:48,892
But I don't know
where it is.

27
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:50,969
Ooh.
Maybe it's a stripper.

28
00:00:51,056 --> 00:00:52,509
What is wrong with you?

29
00:00:52,596 --> 00:00:54,009
Sorry. Hormones.

30
00:00:54,096 --> 00:00:55,910
Well, knowing her,
it's a cadaver.

31
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:57,639
But this hospital,
in particular...

32
00:00:57,726 --> 00:00:59,259
- Welcome back, Dr. Grey!

00:01:03,886 --> 00:01:05,150
Mine, too, Helm.

37
00:01:05,238 --> 00:01:06,744
Bailey re-hired you?

38
00:01:06,972 --> 00:01:08,549
Well, I was gonna tell you,

39
00:01:08,636 --> 00:01:10,441
but you were too busy
dumping me.

40
00:01:11,449 --> 00:01:13,845
I did not dump you.
I asked you to take some time.

41
00:01:13,933 --> 00:01:15,486
Rob/steal.
Murder/kill.

42
00:01:15,574 --> 00:01:16,679

the same thing.

00:01:16,766 --> 00:01:17,910
It's home.

44
00:01:18,004 --> 00:01:19,433
Thanks.

45
00:01:19,521 --> 00:01:21,379

Hi.

I'm looking for
Chief Karev.

62
00:02:07,266 --> 00:02:09,434
Uh, Karev's on a personal day.
Can I help you?

63
00:02:09,522 --> 00:02:12,548
I'm Dr. Daphne Lopez.
I'm here for a walk-through.

64
00:02:12,636 --> 00:02:13,889
- Oh, oh. Right, right.
- Yeah.

65
00:02:13,976 --> 00:02:15,189
Karev said that
you were coming.

66
00:02:15,276 --> 00:02:17,290
You're the ER doc
from UCLA?

67
00:02:17,378 --> 00:02:18,429
Yep. That's me.

68
00:02:18,516 --> 00:02:20,415
Well, and good to finally meet you.
Yeah.

69
00:02:20,503 --> 00:02:22,291
I'm Owen Hunt, and this is
Dr. Richard Webber.

70
00:02:22,378 --> 00:02:23,698
- Pleasure.
- Nice to meet you.

71
00:02:23,786 --> 00:02:26,258
Um, Karev said that
we're trying to woo you

72
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:28,065
to see if we can get you

73
00:02:28,153 --> 00:02:29,418
to come over here
instead of Seattle Pres.

74
00:02:29,505 --> 00:02:31,401
Well, I'll tell you a secret...
You're winning.

75
00:02:31,636 --> 00:02:33,042
They can't afford me.

76
00:02:38,386 --> 00:02:39,354
You really should start

77
00:02:39,442 --> 00:02:40,449
bringing all your patients
here,

78
00:02:40,536 --> 00:02:42,113
- you know?
- Oh, yeah? "Sorry, sir.

- Yeah.
- "...we got to go."

82

- He'll understand.
- Yeah?

83
00:02:48,981 --> 00:02:50,929
- What time does your shift end tonight?
- Tomorrow morning.

84
00:02:51,016 --> 00:02:52,355
Well, maybe I'll show up
at the fire station

85
00:02:52,442 --> 00:02:53,743
- with an emergency.
- And then

86
00:02:53,838 --> 00:02:55,433
- Jackson.
- I'll be at the hospital across town.

87
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,823
Hey, Ma.

88
00:02:56,911 --> 00:02:59,462
Mom, I did not know
you were back in town.

90
00:03:00,845 --> 00:03:03,995
Well, apparently
limos can be death traps.

91
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:06,484

I signed up to be
a Safe Haven volunteer,

139
00:04:47,027 --> 00:04:49,689
which means that, when a baby
is dropped off at a fire station

140
00:04:49,777 --> 00:04:52,041
in the vicinity,
they call me, and...

141
00:04:52,129 --> 00:04:53,283

151
00:05:09,066 --> 00:05:10,799
Which therapist
told you to do this?

152
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:13,330
Carly. But she...
She didn't tell me to do it.

153
00:05:13,418 --> 00:05:15,103
She told me that
she did it.

154
00:05:15,637 --> 00:05:16,930
And how is
that helpful?

155
00:05:17,252 --> 00:05:19,650
Well, hearing her story
made me feel better...

156
00:05:19,738 --> 00:05:22,307
And I don't know... It just sounded nice...
Helping someone.

157
00:05:22,769 --> 00:05:25,408
You sure it's not too much
too soon?

158
00:05:25,643 --> 00:05:26,963
Can you come with me?

159
00:05:27,051 --> 00:05:28,805

167
00:05:46,473 --> 00:05:47,767
None for you, traitor.

168
00:05:47,855 --> 00:05:50,283
I didn't mean to rat out Grey,
and you all know that.

169
00:05:50,371 --> 00:05:51,564
I was just
doing my job.

170
00:05:51,652 --> 00:05:53,065
Mm-hmm. That's what
the Nazis said.

171
00:05:53,153 --> 00:05:56,095
Okay, my great-grandfather
was in a concentration camp,

172
00:05:56,183 --> 00:05:57,525
so that's really
not cool to say.

173
00:05:57,613 --> 00:05:59,103
Apologize to the traitor.

174
00:05:59,191 --> 00:06:00,447
Sorry, traitor.

175
00:06:00,535 --> 00:06:02,398
Excuse me. Coming through.

176
00:06:02,486 --> 00:06:04,569
Excuse me.

177
00:06:04,695 --> 00:06:05,818
Look, Grey's back, alright?

178
00:06:05,905 --> 00:06:07,447
So you can all
shut up about it now.

179
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:10,861
- Hi, Elliott. Finley?
- Hi.

180
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,728
Wheelchair?
What happened?

181
00:06:12,816 --> 00:06:13,922
- Jasper happened.
- Jasper.

182
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:15,875
4 pounds, 14 ounces.

183
00:06:15,963 --> 00:06:16,869
Wow.
You had the baby!

184
00:06:16,957 --> 00:06:17,940
I thought he wasn't due
for another month.

185
00:06:18,028 --> 00:06:19,744
- Oh, he wasn't.
- No, but he's okay.

186
00:06:19,832 --> 00:06:21,455
- He's in the NICU.
- Yeah.

187
00:06:21,543 --> 00:06:22,432
Oh, yeah, show her,
show her.

188
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,893
Check out this
little alien.

189
00:06:23,981 --> 00:06:24,895
Aww.

190
00:06:24,983 --> 00:06:25,963
- Yeah.
- Isn't he cute?

191
00:06:26,051 --> 00:06:27,714
We're calling him "E.T."
for short.

192
00:06:27,802 --> 00:06:29,829
Yeah, I was in the middle
of my usual pre-surgery fast

193
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:30,924
when her water broke.

194
00:06:31,012 --> 00:06:32,127
He wanted to postpone,
and I was like,

195
00:06:32,214 --> 00:06:33,057
"No.

196
00:06:33,145 --> 00:06:34,555
You don't postpone
heart surgery."

197
00:06:34,643 --> 00:06:36,947
Yeah. Jasper's immune system's
still a little wonky.

198
00:06:37,035 --> 00:06:39,195
They're not letting me hold him
until I get discharged.

199
00:06:40,355 --> 00:06:41,752
Schmitt,
present, please.

200
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:43,940
Elliott Calhoun, 39,

201
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:46,112
here for a fourth
aortic valve replacement

202
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,463
due to congenital
aortic stenosis.

203
00:06:48,628 --> 00:06:50,157
Okay, 64-year-old male.

204
00:06:50,245 --> 00:06:51,266
In remission for over a year

205
00:06:51,353 --> 00:06:52,956
after being treated
for mesothelioma.

206
00:06:53,044 --> 00:06:55,151
Primary complaints
are night sweats, weight loss,

207
00:06:55,239 --> 00:06:56,892
and an inguinal
and testicular mass.

208
00:06:57,052 --> 00:06:58,159
Lymphoma.

209
00:06:58,247 --> 00:07:00,019
It's a little early to jump
to that conclusion, Simms.

210
00:07:00,106 --> 00:07:02,252
Pretty solid conclusion
to jump to.

211
00:07:05,357 --> 00:07:07,556
Uh, you all
can go on to the next patient.

212
00:07:07,643 --> 00:07:08,813
I've got this.

213
00:07:13,018 --> 00:07:14,011
Dr. Bailey.

214
00:07:14,099 --> 00:07:15,802
Captain Herrera.

215
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,760
I'm so sorry
to see you back here.

216
00:07:20,135 --> 00:07:22,534
Please don't tell your husband
my cancer's back.

217
00:07:22,721 --> 00:07:24,728
Okay, first,
we don't know that,

218
00:07:24,847 --> 00:07:27,775
and of course
I won't say a word.

219
00:07:33,373 --> 00:07:34,921
Good morning,
good morning.

220
00:07:35,009 --> 00:07:35,965
- Good morning. Hi.
- Hi.

221
00:07:36,053 --> 00:07:37,767
- Hi.
- Hi. Good morning.

222
00:07:38,001 --> 00:07:39,384
Dr. DeLuca.

223
00:07:40,329 --> 00:07:42,197
- Jamie Caldwell... 13.
- Jamie.

224
00:07:42,285 --> 00:07:44,635
I know Jamie. I took out your
gallbladder two years ago.

225
00:07:44,723 --> 00:07:46,033
How are we doing?

226
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:48,541
Zachary just commented
on Tessa's photo

227
00:07:48,629 --> 00:07:50,611
with a heart emoji.
When I'm dying.

228
00:07:50,715 --> 00:07:52,665
You're not dying.
She's not dying. Right?

229
00:07:52,753 --> 00:07:55,493
Jamie presents with a palpable
3 by centimeter mass

230
00:07:55,581 --> 00:07:57,200
in between her ribs
on her right side, which...

231
00:07:57,287 --> 00:07:58,287
- Hurts like hell.
- Yeah.

232
00:07:58,394 --> 00:07:59,472
Language.

233
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,886
Can you cut this thing off
before Tessa's bat mitzvah?

234
00:08:01,973 --> 00:08:04,796
Zachary Schultz isn't gonna
dance with a hunchback.

235
00:08:06,094 --> 00:08:07,674
Who's presenting?

236
00:08:11,972 --> 00:08:13,297
There a problem?

237
00:08:14,172 --> 00:08:15,290
W-We already started.

238
00:08:15,378 --> 00:08:17,507
Hi. Who are you?

239
00:08:17,594 --> 00:08:20,128
Cormac Hayes,
chief of pediatric surgery.

240
00:08:20,693 --> 00:08:21,736
Since when?

241
00:08:21,824 --> 00:08:23,199
Since this morning.

242
00:08:23,554 --> 00:08:25,096
For the future,
let's not round on my patients

243
00:08:25,183 --> 00:08:26,507
when I'm not here.

244
00:08:26,808 --> 00:08:28,081
Start again.

245
00:08:28,169 --> 00:08:31,378
Jamie Caldwell, 13,
presents with persistent back pain...

246
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:39,228
Hey, Alex.
I'm at the fire station.

247
00:08:39,316 --> 00:08:40,830
I'll explain later,
but call me.

248
00:08:40,918 --> 00:08:42,263
And say "hi"
to your mom.

249
00:08:42,351 --> 00:08:43,410
Bye.

250
00:09:01,926 --> 00:09:03,049
- Hey.
- Hi.

251
00:09:03,137 --> 00:09:07,418
Um... there was a-a baby
dropped off here?

252
00:09:07,988 --> 00:09:09,619
Oh. Yeah, okay.

253
00:09:09,707 --> 00:09:12,705
So, uh,
if you change your mind,

254
00:09:12,793 --> 00:09:14,222
according to law,
you have 72 hours to...

255
00:09:14,309 --> 00:09:15,416
Oh.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

256
00:09:15,504 --> 00:09:17,987
No. I'm not the mother.
I'm the Safe Haven thingy.

257
00:09:18,075 --> 00:09:19,908
I'm sorry. So sorry.
I'm Victoria Hughes.

258
00:09:19,996 --> 00:09:20,776
Thanks for coming.

259
00:09:20,871 --> 00:09:23,033
Oh, yeah, Vic.
Um, you're Jackson's girlfriend.

260
00:09:23,587 --> 00:09:24,916
Girlf... Girlfriend?

261
00:09:25,004 --> 00:09:26,330
Well, no.
No labels.

262
00:09:26,418 --> 00:09:27,901
But, um,
did he say something?

263
00:09:27,989 --> 00:09:29,369
Did... You know what?
Never mind.

264
00:09:29,457 --> 00:09:31,080
Um, sorry.
Who are you?

265
00:09:31,168 --> 00:09:33,041
- I...
- Uh, that would be Jo Karev.

266
00:09:33,129 --> 00:09:34,893
Hi.

267
00:09:34,981 --> 00:09:36,393
- Hey.
- Hey.

268
00:09:36,481 --> 00:09:38,474
Hi. Oh, wow.
Oh.

269
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:40,487
That's a brand-new baby.

270
00:09:40,575 --> 00:09:42,408
Yep. Fresh out the oven.

271
00:09:42,496 --> 00:09:43,855
We're guessing
three days old.

272
00:09:43,942 --> 00:09:46,455
<i>Engine requested to
368 Great Marsh Road.</i>

273
00:09:46,543 --> 00:09:49,072
That would be
Mrs. Wiinikainen again.

274
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,028
What else does she
have to burn down?

275
00:09:51,189 --> 00:09:53,705
Um, Mrs. Wiinikainen
tends to light things on fire

276
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:54,612
when she gets lonely.

277
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,535
- Oof. Dark.
- <i>Come on, guys. We got a call.</i>

278
00:09:56,622 --> 00:09:57,826
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

279
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:01,332
Oh, my goodness.

280
00:10:02,813 --> 00:10:03,847
Come on.
Let me show you around.

281
00:10:03,934 --> 00:10:05,917
Okay.

282
00:10:07,598 --> 00:10:09,322
So, I have
a valve replacement

283
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:11,754
on a chronic
aortic stenosis.

284
00:10:11,842 --> 00:10:12,856
You want to scrub in?

285
00:10:12,944 --> 00:10:13,989
Okay.

286
00:10:14,077 --> 00:10:15,780
- Why?
- Hmm?

287
00:10:15,991 --> 00:10:18,614
Why do you need me to scrub in
on a valve replacement?

288
00:10:18,765 --> 00:10:20,067
No, I don't. I don't.
I just...

289
00:10:20,155 --> 00:10:21,228
thought it would be fun.

290
00:10:21,315 --> 00:10:23,075
Okay, but it's
a valve replacement,

291
00:10:23,163 --> 00:10:25,736
which I'm pretty sure you can do
with your eyes closed.

292
00:10:25,899 --> 00:10:27,481
Okay, well, if you don't
want to help...

293
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:28,637
No. I do. I do.

294
00:10:28,819 --> 00:10:32,192
God, I haven't seen a heart that
isn't traumatized in months.

295
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:34,004
- Too real.
- Okay.

296
00:10:39,481 --> 00:10:41,614
It feels hard...
Almost like a bone.

297
00:10:41,702 --> 00:10:42,754
Have we ordered a CT?

298
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:45,442
I was about to,
but then I got interrupted.

299
00:10:46,015 --> 00:10:47,309
Jamie,
I'm gonna get some scans

300
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:49,308
so we can get a better idea
of what's causing your pain

301
00:10:49,395 --> 00:10:50,768
- and the, um...
- Zit-hump?

302
00:10:50,855 --> 00:10:52,040
Right. That.

303
00:10:52,128 --> 00:10:54,241
Okay, Parker.
Let's get her up to CT.

304
00:10:54,359 --> 00:10:55,465
Like I said.

305
00:10:57,605 --> 00:10:58,653
Happy first day.

306
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:00,454
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

307
00:11:06,175 --> 00:11:07,660
We'll see you soon,
Jamie.

308
00:11:10,715 --> 00:11:12,322
Oh, how's the baby?

309
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:13,481
How are you feeling?

310
00:11:13,569 --> 00:11:15,227
Oh, we're both good.

311
00:11:15,315 --> 00:11:16,968
But she's acting up
today, though.

312
00:11:17,055 --> 00:11:18,582
Oh. She?

313
00:11:19,843 --> 00:11:21,410
Just a hunch.

314
00:11:21,645 --> 00:11:23,551
Uh, I'll find out for sure
later today.

315
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,653
- Okay, you ready?
- No.

316
00:11:25,962 --> 00:11:27,075
Fine.

317
00:11:31,927 --> 00:11:33,200
Okay.

318
00:11:35,605 --> 00:11:37,059
Oh.

319
00:11:38,068 --> 00:11:39,723
That's a mass, isn't it?

320
00:11:39,901 --> 00:11:43,223
We won't know if it's malignant
until we get a biopsy,

321
00:11:43,311 --> 00:11:45,264
so let's not write
any letters home yet.

322
00:11:45,442 --> 00:11:46,801
With my history,

323
00:11:46,889 --> 00:11:49,137
with the statistics
about firefighters and cancer?

324
00:11:49,225 --> 00:11:50,935
No offense, but it doesn't
take a medical degree

325
00:11:51,022 --> 00:11:52,395
to put that together.

326
00:11:52,504 --> 00:11:55,307
No, but it does take
a medical degree

327
00:11:55,395 --> 00:11:57,965
to rule out all options
before panicking.

328
00:11:58,053 --> 00:12:00,386
So, I am going to
get a biopsy.

329
00:12:00,474 --> 00:12:02,028
We'll go from there,
okay?

330
00:12:19,545 --> 00:12:20,755
So?

331
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:25,457
Guess that caught you
by surprise.

332
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:28,466
My son sneaking around with
another woman in plain sight?

333
00:12:28,554 --> 00:12:31,684
What? No.
Nobody's sneaking, okay?

334
00:12:31,772 --> 00:12:34,494
I... broke up with Maggie
months ago. There's no sneaking.

335
00:12:34,582 --> 00:12:35,598
I would have told you
all of this,

336
00:12:35,685 --> 00:12:36,668
but you're traveling
so much,

337
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:39,035
I didn't want to do that
on a text message.

338
00:12:39,138 --> 00:12:40,347
And I promise,
this is not gonna affect

339
00:12:40,434 --> 00:12:41,481
your marriage to Richard.

340
00:12:41,569 --> 00:12:44,192
I'm not sure how much longer
you have to worry about that.

341
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:45,910
What's that
supposed to mean?

342
00:12:46,809 --> 00:12:48,879
Richard is working
with someone

343
00:12:48,967 --> 00:12:52,410
that he may or may not have
a romantic past with.

344
00:12:52,576 --> 00:12:53,909
So, kind of like
you and Koracick?

345
00:12:54,129 --> 00:12:56,059
- That is different.
- How?

346
00:12:56,147 --> 00:12:58,767
Because I don't have a history
of cheating on my spouse.

347
00:12:58,855 --> 00:12:59,950
Oh, Mom. Come on.

348
00:13:00,038 --> 00:13:01,607
Richard would lie down
in traffic for you,

349
00:13:01,694 --> 00:13:03,446
- and you know it.
- I might ask him to.

350
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:06,200
Mom.

351
00:13:06,902 --> 00:13:08,989
Sometimes, when you get
an idea in your head

352
00:13:09,105 --> 00:13:10,520
that you don't like,
you retreat.

353
00:13:10,725 --> 00:13:12,075
I do it, too.

354
00:13:13,012 --> 00:13:14,426
We've just...

355
00:13:14,542 --> 00:13:16,887
barely spoken in weeks.

356
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:18,067
Have you barely spoken,

357
00:13:18,155 --> 00:13:20,572
or you just
don't want to listen?

358
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,223
If I've learned anything,

359
00:13:26,457 --> 00:13:27,754
it's don't be a hero.

360
00:13:27,842 --> 00:13:30,567
Use formula
when you need formula.

361
00:13:30,755 --> 00:13:33,878
Oh, trust me,
I'm all over that.

362
00:13:34,011 --> 00:13:37,214
Breast is best, but, sometimes,
Mommy needs wine.

363
00:13:37,465 --> 00:13:39,432
Okay, one more
deep breath for me.

364
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,971
Okay. We're ready
to prep you, Elliott.

365
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,284
- Okay.
- Uh-huh.

366
00:13:46,605 --> 00:13:47,962
I'm gonna go watch bad TV

367
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:50,034
and eat pudding
and ice my lady parts.

368
00:13:50,122 --> 00:13:51,175
Ooh-la-la.

369
00:13:51,263 --> 00:13:53,628
Enjoy it, 'cause it's
gonna be your last alone time

370
00:13:53,762 --> 00:13:55,089
for the next 18 years.

371
00:13:57,583 --> 00:13:59,323
I don't have to
be scared, right?

372
00:13:59,426 --> 00:14:03,065
If I die, don't ever leave him
with my mother for the weekend.

373
00:14:03,153 --> 00:14:04,721
Shut up.

374
00:14:04,809 --> 00:14:05,813
And I won't.

375
00:14:05,901 --> 00:14:08,320
We're gonna fix you up so you
can hold that beautiful boy.

376
00:14:10,085 --> 00:14:11,701
- Hey.
- Huh?

377
00:14:23,444 --> 00:14:25,484
Not my usual spot
for a meeting,

378
00:14:25,572 --> 00:14:27,289
but this will do.

379
00:14:28,613 --> 00:14:30,813
How are you feeling,
really?

380
00:14:31,397 --> 00:14:33,438
Well, between losing Sabrina

381
00:14:33,526 --> 00:14:35,655
and things
with Catherine, um...

382
00:14:36,185 --> 00:14:37,734
I don't know.

383
00:14:39,214 --> 00:14:42,055
Loss is hard enough
without suffering it alone.

384
00:14:42,706 --> 00:14:44,047
When my husband died,
I was...

385
00:14:44,135 --> 00:14:46,203
I didn't know
you were ever married.

386
00:14:46,364 --> 00:14:48,805
Oh, I don't talk
about it that much.

387
00:14:49,612 --> 00:14:51,320
We married young.

388
00:14:51,975 --> 00:14:53,406
He died young.

389
00:14:53,685 --> 00:14:55,086
I was a widow young.

390
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,703
That's when
I started to drink.

391
00:15:01,055 --> 00:15:02,649
Come on. Let's pray.

392
00:15:03,927 --> 00:15:05,813
Okay.

393
00:15:06,296 --> 00:15:07,688
Hi, Dr. Webber.

394
00:15:07,779 --> 00:15:10,467
Um, Dr. Roth paged me
to do a Dobhoff tube,

395
00:15:10,555 --> 00:15:12,805
but I have
a very serious gag reflex,

396
00:15:12,893 --> 00:15:16,186
so I was wondering...
Um, just do your job, Perez.

397
00:15:16,355 --> 00:15:17,688
Got it.
Thank you, sir.

398
00:15:17,831 --> 00:15:19,824
Nice to meet you,
Mrs. Webber.

399
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,412
Oh.

400
00:15:23,882 --> 00:15:25,095
Come on, now.

401
00:15:27,763 --> 00:15:28,966
God...

402
00:15:29,054 --> 00:15:31,137
- ..grant me the serenity...
- ..grant me the serenity...

403
00:15:31,372 --> 00:15:34,372
to accept the things
I cannot change.

404
00:15:42,848 --> 00:15:43,971
Hey. Hi.

405
00:15:44,059 --> 00:15:44,973
Hey.

406
00:15:45,061 --> 00:15:46,383
Do you need anything?

407
00:15:46,476 --> 00:15:47,736
Oh, uh, no.

408
00:15:47,824 --> 00:15:51,555
Um, Ben is grabbing a bottle
for him, so I just...

409
00:15:52,645 --> 00:15:53,781
God, I don't know.

410
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:55,274
This is just
so surreal.

411
00:15:56,448 --> 00:15:58,117
Yeah. Yeah, babies
freak me out, too.

412
00:15:58,342 --> 00:16:01,758
Oh, no. Um, this...
This baby is me.

413
00:16:01,854 --> 00:16:04,397
I was, uh, abandoned
at a fire station by my mom

414
00:16:04,485 --> 00:16:05,805
when I was 5 days old.

415
00:16:05,893 --> 00:16:07,306
Right.
So, you know, it's...

416
00:16:07,545 --> 00:16:09,352
seems perfectly
natural and healthy

417
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,177
that you would volunteer
for this, then.

418
00:16:11,265 --> 00:16:12,728
What?

419
00:16:12,815 --> 00:16:14,945
Well, it made sense
at the time.

420
00:16:15,526 --> 00:16:16,979
So, you grew up
in the system?

421
00:16:17,277 --> 00:16:18,313
Yeah.

422
00:16:18,401 --> 00:16:19,641
Me too.

423
00:16:20,301 --> 00:16:21,305
Huh.

424
00:16:21,393 --> 00:16:22,553
Did you have
any good parents?

425
00:16:23,109 --> 00:16:23,937
All crap.

426
00:16:25,076 --> 00:16:26,148
You?

427
00:16:26,304 --> 00:16:27,406
I had one good family.

428
00:16:28,098 --> 00:16:29,808
It only lasted about
a year, though.

429
00:16:32,055 --> 00:16:33,125
But now I got
these fools,

430
00:16:33,213 --> 00:16:34,314
so all of it worked out
in the end.

431
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:39,414
So, um... how often
does this happen?

432
00:16:39,651 --> 00:16:41,703
We only get like
seven a year.

433
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,120
In the whole city.

434
00:16:43,262 --> 00:16:45,539
Only seven
abandoned babies?

435
00:16:45,627 --> 00:16:47,370
Wow.
What a freaking blessing.

436
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:49,411
We don't like to use
the word "abandoned."

437
00:16:49,555 --> 00:16:51,320
I mean, they're, uh,
they're surrendered.

438
00:16:51,643 --> 00:16:53,906
By people who decided
they weren't fit to parent.

439
00:16:54,052 --> 00:16:55,465
We try not to judge.

440
00:16:55,553 --> 00:16:57,156
But sometimes, we do.

441
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,227
Look, Jo, you know...

442
00:17:03,145 --> 00:17:05,766
no one's ever happy
about surrendering a baby,

443
00:17:06,193 --> 00:17:08,789
but at least they know that
we'll keep the baby safe.

444
00:17:09,285 --> 00:17:11,617
Hey, you, uh...
you want to feed him?

445
00:17:12,499 --> 00:17:14,452
Okay.
Yeah.

446
00:17:15,195 --> 00:17:17,146
Oh, my gosh. Wow.
Look at you.

447
00:17:25,942 --> 00:17:27,899
You can't
hate me forever.

448
00:17:28,956 --> 00:17:31,531
I know I screwed all of us
by getting Meredith Grey fired,

449
00:17:31,619 --> 00:17:33,662
but I was just trying not
to get myself fired.

450
00:17:33,814 --> 00:17:35,109
I made a mistake,

451
00:17:35,212 --> 00:17:37,228
and I thought you, of all people,
would understand that.

452
00:17:37,315 --> 00:17:38,602
Why me of
all people?

453
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:39,828
Because you
mess up, too.

454
00:17:39,916 --> 00:17:41,808
You're just better
at covering your ass than I am.

455
00:17:41,895 --> 00:17:43,000
Hey, guys?

456
00:17:43,114 --> 00:17:44,588
Uh, if I don't make it
through this surgery,

457
00:17:44,675 --> 00:17:46,628
I'm gonna be really bummed
if this fight of yours

458
00:17:46,716 --> 00:17:47,959
is the last thing
I hear.

459
00:17:48,047 --> 00:17:49,330
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

460
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:53,332
Actually,
can we make a stop?

461
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:03,758
Oh, God.

462
00:18:04,068 --> 00:18:05,561
Hey.

463
00:18:05,664 --> 00:18:07,577
I just wanted to see him
before I went under...

464
00:18:07,665 --> 00:18:09,031
Just in case.

465
00:18:15,512 --> 00:18:17,215
Elliott.

466
00:18:19,768 --> 00:18:20,899
Ahhhh.

467
00:18:24,039 --> 00:18:26,159
Go get
a cow valve already, will you?

468
00:18:26,358 --> 00:18:28,151
Moo.

469
00:18:28,269 --> 00:18:30,789
I love you guys.

470
00:18:37,469 --> 00:18:38,492
Okay, page me

471
00:18:38,579 --> 00:18:40,195
- the second Path has results.
- Okay.

472
00:18:40,289 --> 00:18:41,697
- Hey.
- Hey.

473
00:18:41,855 --> 00:18:44,469
Ohh. I think my
morning sickness has passed.

474
00:18:44,557 --> 00:18:46,760
Ah. My morning sickness
came in the afternoon.

475
00:18:46,865 --> 00:18:48,766
Mm.
Glad that's over.

476
00:18:48,854 --> 00:18:52,397
I'm having the ultrasound
later today, but I'm torn.

477
00:18:52,485 --> 00:18:54,469
A-Are you gonna
find out the sex?

478
00:18:54,605 --> 00:18:55,867
Nah.

479
00:18:55,955 --> 00:18:57,967
I never understood
the whole gender reveal thing.

480
00:18:58,055 --> 00:18:59,598
I mean, as if you could know
a kid's gender

481
00:18:59,685 --> 00:19:01,297
from a blood test.

482
00:19:01,686 --> 00:19:03,883
Well, you can.

483
00:19:04,066 --> 00:19:05,766
You can know the sex,
not the gender.

484
00:19:05,854 --> 00:19:08,826
Gender is more than just pink
or blue icing in a sheet cake.

485
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:10,030
Hmm. You know, in some
cultures,

486
00:19:10,117 --> 00:19:12,059
they recognize as many
as six different genders.

487
00:19:12,146 --> 00:19:13,641
Right. So,
on your last ultrasound,

488
00:19:13,729 --> 00:19:15,432
you opted not
to find out.

489
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,927
I, uh, actually
haven't had one yet.

490
00:19:19,651 --> 00:19:21,047
How many weeks
are you?

491
00:19:21,145 --> 00:19:23,016
Mm... 20?

492
00:19:23,324 --> 00:19:24,518
Amelia Shepherd.

493
00:19:24,606 --> 00:19:26,031
You're a doctor.

494
00:19:26,119 --> 00:19:27,617
I know. I should have
had one already.

495
00:19:27,705 --> 00:19:29,288
I just am...

496
00:19:29,488 --> 00:19:31,375
..terrified of what
I might find out.

497
00:19:31,463 --> 00:19:33,172
I just can't stop thinking,
"What if?"

498
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:34,805
What if it happens again,

499
00:19:34,893 --> 00:19:36,961
or w-what if
it's something worse?

500
00:19:37,049 --> 00:19:39,172
What if it's an alien?
Or a tumor?

501
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:42,303
What if I am not even pregnant,
I am just a crazy person,

502
00:19:42,391 --> 00:19:44,203
and I just exploded
my boyfriend's life

503
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:45,320
for no reason?

504
00:19:45,408 --> 00:19:47,556
The best way to fight fear
is with information.

505
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:50,266
You can't fix
what you don't know.

506
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:53,102
Pregnancy Club
just got way less fun.

507
00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:55,899
<i>Laurie Reed,
return to the admit desk.</i>

508
00:19:55,987 --> 00:19:57,508
<i>Laurie Reed,
return to the admit desk.</i>

509
00:20:04,938 --> 00:20:06,058
I checked with
the mail room.

510
00:20:06,145 --> 00:20:07,594
- No packages for you.
- Thanks.

511
00:20:07,682 --> 00:20:08,774
Didn't realize
the residents

512
00:20:08,862 --> 00:20:10,563
were also our
personal assistants.

513
00:20:10,651 --> 00:20:12,344
I was doing Dr. Grey
a favor.

514
00:20:12,457 --> 00:20:13,808
Well, Grey, if you've
got errands to run,

515
00:20:13,895 --> 00:20:14,968
I've got this covered.

516
00:20:17,725 --> 00:20:18,852
Look at that.

517
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:19,973
Mass between
the 9th and 10th ribs.

518
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:21,844
That's easily accessible.

519
00:20:21,973 --> 00:20:23,136
Simms, book an OR.

520
00:20:23,224 --> 00:20:25,156
Make sure the lab's ready
to run the biopsy.

521
00:20:26,894 --> 00:20:28,206
But it may not
be a tumor.

522
00:20:28,294 --> 00:20:29,924
Well, maybe you haven't
seen many sarcomas.

523
00:20:30,011 --> 00:20:31,992
I've seen everything,
thanks.

524
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,493
And I did take out
her gallbladder two years ago,

525
00:20:34,682 --> 00:20:36,465
so some gallstones
may have spilled

526
00:20:36,553 --> 00:20:38,046
and migrated
to her back.

527
00:20:38,172 --> 00:20:40,633
So, your medical opinion is
you did shoddy work?

528
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:44,000
My medical opinion is

529
00:20:44,088 --> 00:20:45,914
I see no need
to worry her mother

530
00:20:46,002 --> 00:20:48,008
with talk
of tumors or cancer

531
00:20:48,096 --> 00:20:49,849
unless we really need to.

532
00:20:49,996 --> 00:20:51,263
Who are you, exactly?

533
00:20:51,355 --> 00:20:53,518
Meredith Grey.
I'm chief of general surgery.

534
00:20:53,605 --> 00:20:55,558
Oh, Grey.
Yeah.

535
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:57,068
I've heard of you.

536
00:20:57,156 --> 00:20:58,399
You're the one
who got yourself

537
00:20:58,487 --> 00:21:00,230
and half the staff fired,
yeah?

538
00:21:00,475 --> 00:21:02,787
Who hired you?
Bailey or Koracick?

539
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:03,834
Why?

540
00:21:03,922 --> 00:21:05,967
Bailey usually has too much
sense to hire surgeons

541
00:21:06,055 --> 00:21:08,588
whose egos are too big
to fit in an OR.

542
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:11,153
Let's prep her for
a core needle biopsy,

543
00:21:11,241 --> 00:21:13,494
and don't say a thing
to her mother about cancer.

544
00:21:23,619 --> 00:21:25,788
Hey, uh,
you want a ride to the hospital?

545
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:28,498
Miranda's got an ultrasound,
so I'm taking the afternoon off.

546
00:21:28,586 --> 00:21:30,342
How can
a person do this?

547
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:33,800
I mean, I-I-I thought I would
do this volunteer thing

548
00:21:33,888 --> 00:21:34,997
and understand better,

549
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:37,803
and... maybe I could
forgive my mother.

550
00:21:37,891 --> 00:21:38,959
But I can't.

551
00:21:39,148 --> 00:21:42,891
I-I... I can't call
what she did brave.

552
00:21:42,979 --> 00:21:45,027
I-I can't call it
"surrendering."

553
00:21:45,115 --> 00:21:46,818
I...

554
00:21:47,289 --> 00:21:53,488
And just looking...
at this tiny, little guy,

555
00:21:53,576 --> 00:21:56,308
I understand even less
how she did what she did.

556
00:21:56,395 --> 00:21:58,584
- Jo, just... as a reminder...
- Yeah.

557
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:01,369
...trauma and...
and your brain chemicals

558
00:22:01,457 --> 00:22:04,433
c-can prompt a human being
to behave in ways

559
00:22:04,521 --> 00:22:07,168
that people with more
balanced brain chemistry

560
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:09,443
can have a hard time
understanding.

561
00:22:10,556 --> 00:22:12,082
Right.

562
00:22:12,178 --> 00:22:13,316
Right.

563
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:16,714
Link thinks this is
too much too soon.

564
00:22:19,745 --> 00:22:21,209
Let's get this guy
to the hospital.

565
00:22:21,297 --> 00:22:23,261
You can hand him off
to the social worker there.

566
00:22:23,411 --> 00:22:26,191
We did his physical exam,
and he is all good.

567
00:22:26,315 --> 00:22:27,543
Yeah.

568
00:22:27,631 --> 00:22:29,834
Except for the fact that
his parents don't want him.

569
00:22:30,036 --> 00:22:32,949
No, the people who gave birth
to him don't want him.

570
00:22:33,091 --> 00:22:34,584
His parents...

571
00:22:34,672 --> 00:22:36,012
just haven't met him yet.

572
00:22:37,015 --> 00:22:38,348
Okay.

573
00:22:45,162 --> 00:22:47,075
What's the activated
clotting time?

574
00:22:47,163 --> 00:22:49,058
485 seconds.

575
00:22:49,293 --> 00:22:50,332
Thank you.

576
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:52,332
You asked that
three minutes ago.

577
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:53,583
I know.

578
00:22:53,671 --> 00:22:55,544
DeBakey and 15 blade.

579
00:22:55,737 --> 00:22:57,910
I was visiting Owen
at Pac North the other day.

580
00:22:57,998 --> 00:23:00,371
Whew! Karev has his work
cut out for him.

581
00:23:00,505 --> 00:23:02,208
Mm-hmm.
We've got a good plane

582
00:23:02,296 --> 00:23:04,394
between the calcified
and the normal tissue.

583
00:23:04,499 --> 00:23:06,144
Owen's been begging me
to come over there,

584
00:23:06,293 --> 00:23:07,746
fix the cardio department.

585
00:23:07,834 --> 00:23:09,787
Apparently,
their top surgeon

586
00:23:09,875 --> 00:23:12,433
is, like,
200th in the country.

587
00:23:12,549 --> 00:23:15,412
I mean, i-it might be a good
opportunity to build a program.

588
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,413
Time to separate the valve
from the annulus.

589
00:23:17,501 --> 00:23:19,044
I mean, I'm happy
in trauma for now,

590
00:23:19,132 --> 00:23:21,125
and you are doing
a terrific job here,

591
00:23:21,213 --> 00:23:22,506
but, God, do I miss this.

592
00:23:22,594 --> 00:23:24,628
Dr. Altman, I asked you
to scrub in today

593
00:23:24,716 --> 00:23:27,089
to help speed things along,
not chit-chat.

594
00:23:27,184 --> 00:23:28,479
If you want to go
work at Pac North,

595
00:23:28,566 --> 00:23:29,468
go work at Pac North.

596
00:23:29,555 --> 00:23:30,518
Metz.

597
00:23:35,055 --> 00:23:37,074
God.

598
00:23:40,613 --> 00:23:41,856
You.

599
00:23:41,975 --> 00:23:43,638
Where is
Dr. Webber's office?

600
00:23:43,725 --> 00:23:45,636
Um, is he expecting you?

601
00:23:45,896 --> 00:23:47,689
What is your name?

602
00:23:48,418 --> 00:23:49,675
Z... Zander Perez.

603
00:23:49,808 --> 00:23:52,428
Have you heard
of the Catherine Fox Foundation,

604
00:23:52,515 --> 00:23:54,035
Zander Perez?

605
00:23:54,123 --> 00:23:55,076
No.

606
00:23:55,164 --> 00:23:57,017
Well,
I am Catherine Fox.

607
00:23:57,105 --> 00:23:58,441
I own the foundation,

608
00:23:58,554 --> 00:24:02,177
and the foundation owns 30%
of all the hospitals in America.

609
00:24:02,287 --> 00:24:03,450
Oh.

610
00:24:03,538 --> 00:24:05,041
Does it own this one?

611
00:24:06,199 --> 00:24:07,982
Just show me
to his office, son.

612
00:24:08,123 --> 00:24:09,582
Okay. Of course.

613
00:24:09,677 --> 00:24:10,888
But, actually,
can you wait right here

614
00:24:10,975 --> 00:24:12,228
while I page Dr. Webber?

615
00:24:12,315 --> 00:24:13,699
He was having coffee
with his wife,

616
00:24:13,787 --> 00:24:15,714
so I don't want
to interrupt them.

617
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:18,386
I am his wife.

618
00:24:18,964 --> 00:24:20,377
Oh.

619
00:24:20,605 --> 00:24:21,816
My.

620
00:24:21,904 --> 00:24:23,628
Um...

621
00:24:25,077 --> 00:24:27,347
What are you talking about?
I can't believe...

622
00:24:27,935 --> 00:24:29,324
Parker!

623
00:24:29,832 --> 00:24:31,355
I couldn't stop him.

624
00:24:31,848 --> 00:24:33,652
Mommy,
you said I wasn't dying.

625
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,753
Okay, honey, stay calm.
You're not dying.

626
00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:37,715
I want you to have all
the information as we have it.

627
00:24:37,802 --> 00:24:39,835
No more surprises than
are absolutely necessary.

628
00:24:39,923 --> 00:24:41,988
- Dr. Grey.
- So, I know this is scary,

629
00:24:42,076 --> 00:24:44,137
but Jamie has not exhibited
any symptoms

630
00:24:44,225 --> 00:24:45,348
that would
prompt us to believe

631
00:24:45,435 --> 00:24:46,683
this is
a worst-case scenario.

632
00:24:46,771 --> 00:24:48,354
So, let's not
try to go there.

633
00:24:48,451 --> 00:24:50,363
We'll know more
in a few hours.

634
00:24:50,855 --> 00:24:52,863
Mommy, I'm scared.

635
00:24:53,185 --> 00:24:55,300
I know, honey.
Me too.

636
00:24:55,388 --> 00:24:57,355
We'll bring her up
to the OR shortly.

637
00:24:58,421 --> 00:24:59,964
Is this what
you wanted?

638
00:25:00,379 --> 00:25:02,662
This has got nothing to do
with what I want.

639
00:25:06,347 --> 00:25:08,550
Am I a terrible mother
and a worse doctor

640
00:25:08,638 --> 00:25:09,988
for not getting
an ultrasound?

641
00:25:10,105 --> 00:25:11,356
You haven't gotten
an ultrasound?

642
00:25:11,443 --> 00:25:12,532
Okay.

643
00:25:12,619 --> 00:25:14,387
Your question kind of
answers my question.

644
00:25:14,475 --> 00:25:15,824
I just...

645
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:17,708
You're halfway through
the pregnancy.

646
00:25:17,795 --> 00:25:20,788
Don't we want to know
everything there is to know?

647
00:25:22,678 --> 00:25:25,043
He dumped my sister,
and you put him on your service?

648
00:25:25,769 --> 00:25:28,558
Unreal. That...

649
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:30,943
I did not dump her.

650
00:25:31,031 --> 00:25:32,400
You didn't?

651
00:25:32,488 --> 00:25:33,605
No.

652
00:25:33,693 --> 00:25:35,222
You want to go
clear that up?

653
00:25:38,467 --> 00:25:40,128
She doesn't see me
as her equal,

654
00:25:40,225 --> 00:25:43,082
so I told her to
take some time and...

655
00:25:43,247 --> 00:25:44,627
figure out
what she wants.

656
00:25:47,302 --> 00:25:48,410
What?

657
00:25:48,498 --> 00:25:51,496
I... I want to be supportive
because I can see you're upset,

658
00:25:51,584 --> 00:25:53,886
but, uh... I'm confused.

659
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:56,543
And she doesn't see you
as her equal 'cause...

660
00:25:56,645 --> 00:25:57,968
you're not her equal.

661
00:25:58,055 --> 00:25:59,621
I mean, no offense.
Neither am I.

662
00:25:59,794 --> 00:26:02,113
I'm great.
She's... better.

663
00:26:02,253 --> 00:26:03,933
And you're...

664
00:26:04,357 --> 00:26:05,690
still a resident.

665
00:26:06,098 --> 00:26:07,582
It's just a matter
of respect.

666
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:09,374
Yeah, well, my boyfriend
isn't my equal.

667
00:26:09,461 --> 00:26:10,964
Doesn't mean
I don't respect him.

668
00:26:11,355 --> 00:26:13,138
But if he told me
to "take some time"...

669
00:26:13,682 --> 00:26:15,777
Yeah, no,
I would not respect that.

670
00:26:21,693 --> 00:26:23,097
Dude...

671
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:25,480
go get her and undo
whatever it is you did,

672
00:26:25,568 --> 00:26:27,571
because
you're not her equal,

673
00:26:27,659 --> 00:26:29,582
but she fell in love with you
knowing the facts.

674
00:26:29,749 --> 00:26:32,839
But when you try to make
the facts not the facts,

675
00:26:33,055 --> 00:26:34,808
that's how you drive
someone crazy.

676
00:26:37,678 --> 00:26:40,550
Valve's in, and we're
almost done closing the aorta.

677
00:26:40,685 --> 00:26:42,082
Okay.

678
00:26:43,114 --> 00:26:45,309
Okay, good. Good.

679
00:26:45,506 --> 00:26:46,637
Nice work, Pierce.

680
00:26:46,725 --> 00:26:47,684
Thank you.

681
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:49,209
Always heard you were
even better with hearts

682
00:26:49,296 --> 00:26:50,459
than with bloody guts.

683
00:26:50,547 --> 00:26:51,671
Didn't believe
it could be true, Altman,

684
00:26:51,758 --> 00:26:52,881
but you proved me wrong.

685
00:26:52,969 --> 00:26:54,145
Thank you, Tom.

686
00:26:57,324 --> 00:26:58,848
Why don't you just tell him
to leave you alone?

687
00:26:58,935 --> 00:26:59,965
He's my boss.

688
00:27:00,053 --> 00:27:01,926
And I broke his heart,
and I feel guilty.

689
00:27:02,014 --> 00:27:04,559
Wow. So many lawsuits
in one explanation.

690
00:27:04,647 --> 00:27:06,489
He's fine. He's harmless.
And we're friends.

691
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:07,594
Does he know that?
'Cause

692
00:27:07,682 --> 00:27:09,926
he seems to think
that he has a future with you,

693
00:27:10,014 --> 00:27:12,132
and you don't seem to be
interested in clearing that up.

694
00:27:13,887 --> 00:27:15,553
Okay.
Clamps off.

695
00:27:15,641 --> 00:27:17,232
Let's take the patient
off bypass.

696
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,568
Dr. Altman,
they need you in the pit.

697
00:27:19,788 --> 00:27:20,967
You're good
to close, yeah?

698
00:27:21,055 --> 00:27:22,513
Yes. Thank you
for the assist.

699
00:27:22,601 --> 00:27:23,811
Mm-hmm.

700
00:27:24,382 --> 00:27:26,232
Dr. Pierce?
Uh, since I was the one

701
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,888
who was supposed to be
on your service today,

702
00:27:27,975 --> 00:27:29,467
do you think
I could close?

703
00:27:33,296 --> 00:27:34,210
Dr. Pierce?

704
00:27:34,298 --> 00:27:36,224
Shut up.
Shut up. Um...

705
00:27:38,237 --> 00:27:40,310
Shouldn't his heart
be restarting by now?

706
00:27:40,561 --> 00:27:42,810
I don't know why...
Why it isn't restarting.

707
00:27:43,035 --> 00:27:44,658
Why isn't it restarting?

708
00:27:50,597 --> 00:27:51,740
What is it?

709
00:27:53,807 --> 00:27:55,014
Lymphoma?

710
00:27:57,530 --> 00:27:59,123
I thought I was
out of the woods.

711
00:27:59,467 --> 00:28:02,130
Listen, uh, the good news is

712
00:28:02,218 --> 00:28:04,084
treatment options
are fairly straightforward.

713
00:28:04,172 --> 00:28:05,165
I'm not doing chemo.

714
00:28:05,253 --> 00:28:06,733
Chemo made me sicker
than cancer ever could.

715
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:09,177
Okay, Pruitt,
testicular lymphoma

716
00:28:09,265 --> 00:28:10,662
is extremely
aggressive.

717
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:12,623
We're talking
less than six months

718
00:28:12,711 --> 00:28:13,914
before it gets
to the lungs.

719
00:28:14,029 --> 00:28:16,359
Dr. Bailey,
you're bleeding.

720
00:28:25,184 --> 00:28:28,099
Thank you again
for today.

721
00:28:29,713 --> 00:28:31,810
You want me to wait until
the social worker shows up?

722
00:28:32,081 --> 00:28:33,784
No. I'm good.

e-epi and milrinone?

733
00:28:57,315 --> 00:28:58,779
We've already
dosed him twice.

734

738
00:29:04,842 --> 00:29:06,519
- Pierce?
- His heart didn't restart.

739
00:29:06,607 --> 00:29:07,521
I don't know what I did.

740
00:29:07,609 --> 00:29:09,942
He's been on bypass
multiple times before, right?

741
00:29:10,053 --> 00:29:11,826
It's probably
hibernating myocardium.

742
00:29:11,929 --> 00:29:13,847
Let's keep him up here
for a couple hours.

743
00:29:13,935 --> 00:29:15,053
It could come back.

744
00:29:15,141 --> 00:29:17,634
Pierce, do you agree
with my recommendation?

745
00:29:18,843 --> 00:29:19,796

00:30:47,328 --> 00:30:48,241
- you were looking for.
- Great.

768
00:30:48,329 --> 00:30:49,821
They haven't
found it yet.

769
00:30:50,225 --> 00:30:51,308
Any word from the lab?

770
00:30:51,395 --> 00:30:52,428
How's that core biopsy?

771
00:30:52,515 --> 00:30:53,638
Pathology's saying
they're just seeing

772
00:30:53,725 --> 00:30:55,514
inflammatory cells
and cholesterol deposits.

773
00:30:55,602 --> 00:30:56,765
No malignancy at all?

774
00:30:56,853 --> 00:30:58,435
- No.
- Okay. Scalpel.

775
00:30:58,523 --> 00:30:59,387

776
00:30:59,475 --> 00:31:00,598

777
00:31:00,685 --> 00:31:01,718

778
00:31:01,805 --> 00:31:03,058
Dr. Grey,
I didn't okay this.

779
00:31:03,146 --> 00:31:05,719
Listen, Dr. whoever You Are,
this is my house.

780
00:31:05,835 --> 00:31:07,096
You're a guest
in my home.

781
00:31:07,184 --> 00:31:08,347
I got this.

782
00:31:11,498 --> 00:31:12,792
Bovie.

783
00:31:18,129 --> 00:31:19,318
So, what do you think?

784
00:31:19,406 --> 00:31:21,928
Should I call Seattle Pres

785
00:31:22,016 --> 00:31:23,342
I don't know.

786
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:27,213
Pools of blood notwithstanding,
you are pretty impressive.

787
00:31:27,334 --> 00:31:28,837

to consider.

788
00:31:29,081 --> 00:31:30,864

789
00:31:34,054 --> 00:31:35,097
Okay.

790
00:31:38,856 --> 00:31:40,099
Okay. What?

791
00:31:40,187 --> 00:31:41,951
Just be careful.

792
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:45,006
Take it from me...
That's a slippery slope.

793
00:31:45,607 --> 00:31:47,027
I'm not dead inside,
okay?

794
00:31:47,115 --> 00:31:49,131

795
00:31:49,302 --> 00:31:51,217
Oh.

796
00:31:51,305 --> 00:31:52,668
Not yet, but I...

797
00:31:52,756 --> 00:31:55,759

to have your third child?

798
00:31:55,847 --> 00:31:57,661

799
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:02,723

we looking at?

803
00:32:21,815 --> 00:32:22,912
It looks like...

804
00:32:23,051 --> 00:32:24,183
is that a large
gallstone?

805
00:32:24,271 --> 00:32:25,254
It's a large gallstone.

806
00:32:25,342 --> 00:32:26,693
In the posterior
chest wall?

807
00:32:26,781 --> 00:32:28,982
Her body reacted to it
like it was foreign tissue

808
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:30,459
and tried to push it out.

809
00:32:31,981 --> 00:32:34,248
Oh, I'm sorry.
Do I sound smug?

810
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:35,849

in his office.

827
00:33:13,719 --> 00:33:15,463

828
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:16,842
The door was closed,

829
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:19,201

832
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:26,017
Okay, look, that sounds like
a miscommunication to me.

833
00:33:26,105 --> 00:33:27,646

a little career bump.

837
00:33:34,101 --> 00:33:35,514
You fired him.

838
00:33:35,602 --> 00:33:36,975
I did no such thing.

839
00:33:37,071 --> 00:33:38,314
Bailey fired him.

840
00:33:38,402 --> 00:33:40,276

Yes.

871
00:34:47,466 --> 00:34:49,339
Uh, and you should, too.

872
00:34:49,490 --> 00:34:50,533

00:34:58,625 --> 00:35:00,538
Yeah. It's a...
It's a girl.

877
00:35:00,635 --> 00:35:01,635

878
00:35:20,147 --> 00:35:22,060

I understand.

a new valve?

882
00:35:27,645 --> 00:35:28,808
Okay.

883
00:35:29,015 --> 00:35:30,511

884
00:35:31,499 --> 00:35:33,488

888

890
00:35:46,935 --> 00:35:48,355
...it might not
start at all?

891
00:35:48,443 --> 00:35:50,856

small chance, but...

892
00:35:50,944 --> 00:35:52,857

a mistake.

896
00:36:00,264 --> 00:36:01,980

Zachary?

959
00:39:00,992 --> 00:39:02,839
13. My age.

960
00:39:03,317 --> 00:39:04,940
Well, as someone
who's raised

961
00:39:05,028 --> 00:39:06,495
a couple
of 13-year-old boys,

962
00:39:06,605 --> 00:39:08,238
I can tell you
two things...

963
00:39:08,555 --> 00:39:09,848
First is, the only
thoughts in their heads

964
00:39:09,935 --> 00:39:11,894
are "Fortnite"
and pizza.

965
00:39:12,210 --> 00:39:15,043
And the second is,
they're terrified of girls,

966
00:39:15,326 --> 00:39:18,409
can't talk to them...
Especially the ones they like.

967
00:39:28,083 --> 00:39:30,097
Ah.

968
00:39:34,961 --> 00:39:37,097
Catherine's gonna be
out of town.

969
00:39:37,711 --> 00:39:39,807
I didn't even know
she was in town.

970
00:39:41,786 --> 00:39:43,887
She's thinks there's
something going on between us,

971
00:39:43,975 --> 00:39:45,446
doesn't she?

972
00:39:45,714 --> 00:39:46,787
Yes.

973
00:39:56,495 --> 00:39:58,528
- Hey.
- Hey.

974
00:39:58,639 --> 00:40:00,472
How'd it go?
How you doing?

975
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,433
Thanks for coming over.

976
00:40:02,605 --> 00:40:03,931
Uh-oh.

977
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:05,191
Was I right?

978
00:40:05,279 --> 00:40:06,596

too soon?

979
00:40:06,684 --> 00:40:08,061

980
00:40:11,515 --> 00:40:16,678
One could argue that it was,
in fact, too much too soon.
