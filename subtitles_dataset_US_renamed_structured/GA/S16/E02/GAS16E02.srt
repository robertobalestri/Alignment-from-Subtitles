1
00:00:04,227 --> 00:00:05,860
When we get sick,

2
00:00:05,884 --> 00:00:08,142
our bodies launch a coordinated defense.

3
00:00:08,166 --> 00:00:09,764
It's called the immune response.

4
00:00:14,688 --> 00:00:16,494
They scheduled my hearing.

5
00:00:16,518 --> 00:00:18,080
And...?

6
00:00:18,104 --> 00:00:20,641
"The medical commission will
gladly expedite your process

7
00:00:20,665 --> 00:00:22,089
and give you the date of..."

8
00:00:22,113 --> 00:00:23,885
That's in three months!

9
00:00:23,909 --> 00:00:25,993
Okay, well, that's...
that's not that bad.

10
00:00:27,325 --> 00:00:29,002
I'll have to go
to the Department of Corrections

11
00:00:29,026 --> 00:00:30,819
to get a day off
to see if I'm still a doctor.

12
00:00:30,843 --> 00:00:32,694
You should go
dressed like this when you go.

13
00:00:32,718 --> 00:00:33,972
It's good, right?!

14
00:00:33,996 --> 00:00:35,188
It's an impressive fashion statement.

15
00:00:35,212 --> 00:00:37,388
It's my disguise.
<i>Once a germ's detected...</i>

16
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:38,497
Have a nice day.

17
00:00:38,522 --> 00:00:39,554
- Oh, look out for needles.
- Thanks. Yeah.

18
00:00:39,578 --> 00:00:42,522
<i>...a team of white blood cells,
proteins, and chemicals</i>

19
00:00:42,546 --> 00:00:43,857
<i>swarm to mount an attack.</i>

20
00:00:43,881 --> 00:00:45,083
You a doctor?

21
00:00:45,107 --> 00:00:46,143
For the moment.

22
00:00:46,167 --> 00:00:48,465
I was wondering if maybe
you could take a look at this.

23
00:00:48,489 --> 00:00:50,203
Time to go, people.

24
00:00:50,227 --> 00:00:52,566
Steam burn from an iron.
I work at a dry cleaner's.

25
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:53,922
They told me to run it under cold water,

26
00:00:53,946 --> 00:00:55,534
but it blistered.

27
00:00:55,558 --> 00:00:57,190
They should've sent you to the doctor.

28
00:00:57,214 --> 00:00:58,273
Is it bad?

29
00:00:58,297 --> 00:00:59,430
Well, it's definitely infected.

30
00:00:59,454 --> 00:01:01,143
It needs debridement and antibiotics.

31
00:01:01,143 --> 00:01:04,005
So, are you gonna give me
that stuff or what?

32
00:01:04,029 --> 00:01:06,371
<i>These cells catch up
to the invaders and latch on,</i>

33
00:01:06,395 --> 00:01:08,002
<i>destroying them in their wake.</i>

34
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:09,287
People, let's go!

35
00:01:10,518 --> 00:01:13,354
Or at least that's
what they're supposed to do.

36
00:01:13,378 --> 00:01:14,640
Mm-hmm.

37
00:01:14,664 --> 00:01:17,177
Okay, I, uh... I don't know
what the special occasion is,

38
00:01:17,201 --> 00:01:19,193
but, uh, I want it noted

39
00:01:19,217 --> 00:01:21,904
I do not miss the green smoothies.

40
00:01:21,928 --> 00:01:24,823
The occasion is that I have no joy.

41
00:01:24,847 --> 00:01:27,048
My best surgeons work elsewhere,

42
00:01:27,072 --> 00:01:28,856
and Catherine gave away my job.

43
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,136
Oh, but you still have a job.

44
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,192
Mm, I have a job,

45
00:01:32,216 --> 00:01:36,502
but then a man, a man who I can't stand,

46
00:01:36,526 --> 00:01:40,916
has another job,
and he has a title above my job.

47
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:42,376
Where's my joy, Ben?

48
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,400
Let me tell you something
about the woman I married.

49
00:01:45,424 --> 00:01:48,783
She don't let anything stop her.

50
00:01:48,807 --> 00:01:54,784
No surgery, no intern,
and certainly no man.

51
00:01:54,808 --> 00:01:56,863
Now, you go back in there,

52
00:01:56,887 --> 00:01:59,645
and you take your joy back.

53
00:01:59,669 --> 00:02:01,527
<i>The body's ability to come back</i>

54
00:02:01,551 --> 00:02:03,334
<i>depends on what you have to fight with...</i>

55
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:06,429
<i>...and how strong you are.</i>

56
00:02:09,476 --> 00:02:12,329
You don't have to go back
to work if you're not ready.

57
00:02:12,353 --> 00:02:15,617
Mm, it's time.

58
00:02:15,641 --> 00:02:17,865
It's time for me to go back
and let everyone stare at me

59
00:02:17,889 --> 00:02:19,827
like I'm some rare, delicate bird

60
00:02:19,851 --> 00:02:21,817
that might shed all my feathers

61
00:02:21,841 --> 00:02:23,994
and fly naked through
the hospital at any moment.

62
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:25,852
I would definitely like to see that.

63
00:02:27,116 --> 00:02:28,982
You know, you can always
come work for me.

64
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,881
Nobody knows who you are
or what happened.

65
00:02:31,882 --> 00:02:33,839
You could run your own fellowship,

66
00:02:33,863 --> 00:02:35,808
be your own boss, keep all your feathers.

67
00:02:36,887 --> 00:02:38,710
My therapist, Michelle,
says it's important

68
00:02:38,734 --> 00:02:42,945
that I try to return
to the life I left, you know,

69
00:02:42,969 --> 00:02:45,231
revisit my routine without
changing things up too much.

70
00:02:45,255 --> 00:02:47,034
You just don't want to work at Pac-North.

71
00:02:47,058 --> 00:02:48,903
Mm.

72
00:02:48,927 --> 00:02:52,677
Is it appropriate for me
to tell Link in a text?

73
00:02:52,701 --> 00:02:55,270
So I can avoid having to
look him in the eye while I say,

74
00:02:55,294 --> 00:02:57,718
"Hey, remember how careful we were?

75
00:02:57,742 --> 00:02:59,977
Not careful enough, Daddy!"

76
00:03:02,108 --> 00:03:04,480
You kept medical textbooks here?

77
00:03:04,505 --> 00:03:06,128
I like to study.

78
00:03:06,435 --> 00:03:08,100
It was a sex thing, wasn't it?

79
00:03:09,552 --> 00:03:11,439
Look, you're a decent person,

80
00:03:11,464 --> 00:03:12,901
and Link is a decent person.

81
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:14,135
He deserves a face-to-face.

82
00:03:15,335 --> 00:03:18,023
Is it poor form for me
to steal all the toilet paper

83
00:03:18,047 --> 00:03:19,586
since I'm the one who always bought it?

84
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:22,060
Mm, I already stole two protein bars.

85
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:24,081
Ew, yikes.

86
00:03:24,106 --> 00:03:26,515
"Yikes"? What, "Yikes"?

87
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:28,017
Nothing.

88
00:03:28,042 --> 00:03:31,319
I... Jackson posted a sunset photo

89
00:03:31,344 --> 00:03:32,569
from his balcony last night.

90
00:03:32,594 --> 00:03:34,072
Oh, let me see it.

91
00:03:40,118 --> 00:03:42,632
"#Freedom"?

92
00:03:42,656 --> 00:03:44,249
I said, "Ew."

93
00:03:48,201 --> 00:03:50,158
Dr. Emma Griggs, report...

94
00:03:52,026 --> 00:03:53,461
Hey. Hey.

95
00:03:53,486 --> 00:03:55,479
First day back, right?

96
00:03:55,504 --> 00:03:57,287
Yeah. Morning, Tom.

97
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:58,678
Oh, shoot.

98
00:03:58,703 --> 00:04:00,208
Is this weird for you?

99
00:04:00,233 --> 00:04:02,747
We've all shared the same,
mm, how should I say it?

100
00:04:02,772 --> 00:04:04,464
- You shouldn't.
- Pastimes?

101
00:04:04,489 --> 00:04:05,493
Lady friends?

102
00:04:05,517 --> 00:04:06,764
- You have poo on your collar.
- What? Where?

103
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:07,840
Made you look.

104
00:04:07,864 --> 00:04:09,579
Oh, you are such a stand-up guy.

105
00:04:09,603 --> 00:04:12,631
Leaving Teddy all alone
in a motel with a new baby.

106
00:04:12,655 --> 00:04:14,260
What are you still doing here, Tom? Hmm?

107
00:04:14,284 --> 00:04:15,781
Don't you have a job back in Baltimore,

108
00:04:15,805 --> 00:04:16,959
or did you lose that, too?

109
00:04:16,983 --> 00:04:19,468
That's a funny way to talk to your boss.

110
00:04:20,444 --> 00:04:21,880
What, Teddy didn't tell you?

111
00:04:21,905 --> 00:04:23,097
Tell me what?

112
00:04:23,122 --> 00:04:24,261
Oh, since your friends went rogue,

113
00:04:24,286 --> 00:04:25,966
Catherine made me God of this place.

114
00:04:25,991 --> 00:04:27,426
So, practice kneeling.

115
00:04:27,451 --> 00:04:29,200
Maybe throw in a few prayers.

116
00:04:29,225 --> 00:04:30,348
Hmm.

117
00:04:34,271 --> 00:04:35,854
Oh. Oh, no.

118
00:04:35,878 --> 00:04:37,731
After me.

119
00:04:40,618 --> 00:04:47,579
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

120
00:04:50,641 --> 00:04:52,528
Nice of you all to finally show up.

121
00:04:52,804 --> 00:04:54,657
We're gonna do things differently today.

122
00:04:54,682 --> 00:04:56,675
Keep up or get out of my sight.

123
00:04:57,219 --> 00:05:00,372
55-year-old male, presents with

124
00:05:00,397 --> 00:05:03,431
weakness of the hips
after walking short distances

125
00:05:03,456 --> 00:05:05,079
and erectile dysfunction.

126
00:05:05,104 --> 00:05:07,182
Who do you think's gonna have to
clean the window after this?

127
00:05:07,207 --> 00:05:08,365
Whoever asked that question.

128
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:10,902
Now, someone tell me what to do first.

129
00:05:10,927 --> 00:05:12,338
Check distal pulses, ABIs.

130
00:05:12,363 --> 00:05:13,937
And if needed, proceed with CT Angio.

131
00:05:13,962 --> 00:05:16,371
Who is he? Who are you?

132
00:05:16,396 --> 00:05:17,763
He's Koracick's protégé.

133
00:05:17,788 --> 00:05:19,089
Fifth year from Hopkins.

134
00:05:19,114 --> 00:05:21,067
We are rounding, not talking.

135
00:05:21,088 --> 00:05:27,667
Now, physical exam revealed
non-palpable femoral pulses,

136
00:05:27,691 --> 00:05:32,298
low ABIs, and the angio shows

137
00:05:32,298 --> 00:05:35,298
near-complete blockage of
blood flow in the distal aorta.

138
00:05:35,322 --> 00:05:37,210
- Diagnosis?
- Leriche syndrome.

139
00:05:37,234 --> 00:05:38,518
Leriche syndrome.

140
00:05:39,467 --> 00:05:40,720
Little late, Qadri.

141
00:05:40,744 --> 00:05:42,041
They're three years ahead of us.

142
00:05:43,247 --> 00:05:46,734
See, uh, you all have been sulking around

143
00:05:46,758 --> 00:05:48,263
for the last month

144
00:05:48,287 --> 00:05:50,991
since I made changes
to the attending staff.

145
00:05:51,015 --> 00:05:55,095
But Alex Karev and Meredith Grey
are my creations.

146
00:05:55,096 --> 00:05:57,609
I made them the surgeons they are.

147
00:05:57,633 --> 00:05:58,999
And I will make new ones.

148
00:05:59,023 --> 00:06:01,467
So, do you want to be
the new Grey and Karev,

149
00:06:01,491 --> 00:06:03,622
or do you want to keep making excuses?

150
00:06:03,646 --> 00:06:05,233
- I want to be Grey.
- Karev!

151
00:06:05,257 --> 00:06:07,862
Grey and Karev would have been
studying the case by now.

152
00:06:07,886 --> 00:06:09,218
Go.

153
00:06:09,242 --> 00:06:11,019
Ah!

154
00:06:13,829 --> 00:06:15,856
I want it noted that I would never

155
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,607
send a message through Instagram
because I am mature.

156
00:06:17,631 --> 00:06:18,765
Very mature.

157
00:06:18,789 --> 00:06:21,208
But if I did, it would be "#Happier,"

158
00:06:21,232 --> 00:06:23,085
"#INoLongerHaveToPlaySmall-

159
00:06:23,109 --> 00:06:24,694
ToThreatenMenAndTheir- ThreatenedEgoes."

160
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:27,589
Mine would be "#JokesOnMe."

161
00:06:27,613 --> 00:06:28,900
I just told Link

162
00:06:28,925 --> 00:06:31,334
I didn't want
to fast-track our relationship.

163
00:06:31,359 --> 00:06:33,143
- You're sure
- I have to tell him?

164
00:06:33,168 --> 00:06:36,132
Whoa!

165
00:06:36,157 --> 00:06:38,124
You're right.

166
00:06:38,149 --> 00:06:39,613
I know. I have to.

167
00:06:39,638 --> 00:06:40,774
- Go, go, go, go!
- Aah!

168
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:47,349
The hits just keep coming.

169
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,331
I'll page Hunt.

170
00:06:49,356 --> 00:06:51,603
Sir? Sir? Lay still.

171
00:06:57,097 --> 00:06:58,627
Dr. Richie to Peds.

172
00:06:58,652 --> 00:07:00,253
Dr. Nancy Richie, report to Peds.

173
00:07:00,446 --> 00:07:01,827
Hey, happy first day!

174
00:07:01,852 --> 00:07:02,885
Is it?

175
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:06,034
You hired me as general
surgery residency director.

176
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:07,946
I've met only two residents.

177
00:07:07,971 --> 00:07:09,037
Where are the rest of them?

178
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,270
There are only two in the entire program.

179
00:07:11,295 --> 00:07:12,990
Huh? And none of the attendings

180
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:15,125
want to put those two residents
on their service.

181
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:17,037
What was the word
they used to describe them?

182
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:18,742
Oh, right. "Incompetent."

183
00:07:18,767 --> 00:07:20,692
And would you like to know
what the residents said?

184
00:07:20,717 --> 00:07:22,015
I feel like you're gonna tell me.

185
00:07:22,053 --> 00:07:24,340
They are so overworked with scut

186
00:07:24,365 --> 00:07:27,053
they don't have time
to hone their mediocre skills.

187
00:07:27,078 --> 00:07:28,542
All right, isn't this why I hired you?

188
00:07:28,567 --> 00:07:31,576
I need a class of more than
two residents, Karev!

189
00:07:31,601 --> 00:07:33,246
I need a skills lab for them,

190
00:07:33,271 --> 00:07:34,984
a core curriculum, visiting professors.

191
00:07:35,009 --> 00:07:36,167
- Chief Karev?
- You know what...

192
00:07:36,192 --> 00:07:37,523
There's an inspector upstairs

193
00:07:37,548 --> 00:07:39,888
who says the helipad elevator
isn't up to code.

194
00:07:41,572 --> 00:07:43,463
Did you know this hospital
was ranked number one?

195
00:07:43,488 --> 00:07:45,028
- What decade?
- This one.

196
00:07:45,053 --> 00:07:46,906
It's number one in mortality rates,

197
00:07:46,931 --> 00:07:49,052
physician burn-out,
patient dissatisfaction,

198
00:07:49,077 --> 00:07:50,339
and malpractice claims.

199
00:07:50,364 --> 00:07:52,008
A bunch of suits
gave me a big pile of money,

200
00:07:52,033 --> 00:07:53,574
and you said I could turn it around.

201
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,417
This was your idea. So help.

202
00:07:57,149 --> 00:07:58,746
You said I'd have an office!

203
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:03,762
Sir? Sir, I'm Dr. Hunt.

204
00:08:03,787 --> 00:08:05,821
Do you have any pain in your neck?

205
00:08:05,845 --> 00:08:07,420
A little, but more in my chest.

206
00:08:07,444 --> 00:08:08,567
It's fine. I'm okay.

207
00:08:08,591 --> 00:08:09,644
C-collar's secured.

208
00:08:09,668 --> 00:08:11,035
Okay.

209
00:08:11,059 --> 00:08:13,635
The scooter... Is it totaled?

210
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:15,157
I'm gonna say yes.

211
00:08:15,181 --> 00:08:18,098
Ohh, I stole my girlfriend's
credit card for the rental.

212
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:19,965
Well, she bought it now.

213
00:08:19,989 --> 00:08:21,636
- We ready to move?
- Yeah.

214
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,588
On "three." One, two, three.

215
00:08:23,612 --> 00:08:25,841
Let's go.

216
00:08:25,865 --> 00:08:27,774
Don't embarrass me.

217
00:08:30,016 --> 00:08:33,855
Um, W-Wade Foltz,
suffers from Leriche syndrome.

218
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,803
Due to a build-up of plaque
in his arteries,

219
00:08:35,828 --> 00:08:37,993
he no longer has sufficient
blood flow to his legs

220
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:39,210
and his, um...

221
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,422
Gentleman parts?

222
00:08:43,475 --> 00:08:44,733
Sure.

223
00:08:44,758 --> 00:08:48,418
History includes a pack-a-day
smoker for 25 years,

224
00:08:48,443 --> 00:08:50,713
elevated BP for 10,

225
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:52,593
and adhesions from a sigmoid resection

226
00:08:52,618 --> 00:08:55,285
due to repeated bouts of diverticulitis.

227
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:56,571
Hmm.

228
00:08:56,596 --> 00:08:57,783
How long have you been symptomatic?

229
00:08:59,298 --> 00:09:00,782
Well, I went to my, uh, doctor

230
00:09:00,807 --> 00:09:03,735
about a Viagra prescription
about nine months ago.

231
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,904
Schmitt? Something you'd like to share?

232
00:09:05,929 --> 00:09:07,589
Um...

233
00:09:08,795 --> 00:09:10,425
patient emergency.

234
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:11,991
Then what are you still doing here?

235
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,345
DeLuca?

236
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:20,387
Right. Uh, today we'll
be doing a surgery called

237
00:09:20,412 --> 00:09:22,125
an axillary bi-femoral-bypass.

238
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:24,386
We will essentially be creating a tunnel

239
00:09:24,411 --> 00:09:26,716
from your armpit
down to your groin with a graft,

240
00:09:26,741 --> 00:09:28,943
which will then redirect
blood flow to all of those,

241
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:31,362
uh, poorly perfused areas.

242
00:09:32,112 --> 00:09:33,547
Okay, trauma one's free.

243
00:09:33,571 --> 00:09:35,146
- Be right there.
- Yeah.

244
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:36,420
I heard about the parking lot.

245
00:09:36,444 --> 00:09:38,388
- Everyone okay?
- Uh, we are fine.

246
00:09:38,412 --> 00:09:39,989
He is hemodynamically stable

247
00:09:40,013 --> 00:09:41,660
with no neurological deficits.

248
00:09:41,684 --> 00:09:42,775
Hey, how's freedom?

249
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:44,721
- You enjoying it?
- What's that?

250
00:09:44,745 --> 00:09:46,192
- Oh, no.
- The sexy firefighter.

251
00:09:46,216 --> 00:09:47,226
She's freedom, right?

252
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,651
Freedom from having to live with someone

253
00:09:48,675 --> 00:09:50,535
who intellectually challenges you?

254
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:52,694
A surgeon dating a firefighter.

255
00:09:52,718 --> 00:09:55,538
You get to feel superior all the time.

256
00:09:55,562 --> 00:09:56,598
Nice.

257
00:09:56,622 --> 00:09:58,515
It wasn't. That was the point.

258
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:00,645
- Hey.
- Ah.

259
00:10:00,669 --> 00:10:02,140
Maggie, I should...

260
00:10:02,164 --> 00:10:03,958
- Yeah.
- If you or Owen need me, just page.

261
00:10:03,982 --> 00:10:05,177
Go.

262
00:10:05,201 --> 00:10:06,333
Dr. Wendy Bliss to
Oncology. Dr. Wendy Bliss to Oncology.

263
00:10:06,357 --> 00:10:07,528
Let's call X-ray.

264
00:10:09,706 --> 00:10:11,177
Hi.

265
00:10:11,201 --> 00:10:12,880
Hey!

266
00:10:12,904 --> 00:10:16,030
Uh, uh, could we go somewhere private?

267
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:19,144
Uh, not that kind of private.

268
00:10:20,212 --> 00:10:22,163
Oh. Oh! Bad private?

269
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:23,207
No. No. I just...

270
00:10:23,232 --> 00:10:24,807
You-met-someone-else kind of private?

271
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:26,163
Pregnant, actually.

272
00:10:27,465 --> 00:10:29,337
I know! It's absurd!

273
00:10:29,565 --> 00:10:31,175
But it's also true.

274
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,383
Uh, judging from my last period,

275
00:10:33,408 --> 00:10:35,469
I'm thinking eight weeks or so.

276
00:10:37,059 --> 00:10:40,080
And, um, I'm not asking you for anything.

277
00:10:40,105 --> 00:10:41,295
I just want to avoid

278
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:44,754
any kind of secret-keeping
or hand-wringing.

279
00:10:44,779 --> 00:10:45,951
Uh, also, I don't have

280
00:10:45,976 --> 00:10:47,772
the best track record with pregnancy,

281
00:10:47,797 --> 00:10:50,032
which is a story
I should probably tell you.

282
00:10:50,057 --> 00:10:51,667
Um...

283
00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:54,120
Head trauma coming in. I gotta go.

284
00:10:54,141 --> 00:10:55,702
Can... Can we finish this later?

285
00:10:56,611 --> 00:10:58,349
Okay.

286
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,825
Dr. Bailey! Chief! Hi. Hi.

287
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:09,973
Karev?

288
00:11:09,998 --> 00:11:13,132
I didn't know you were coming back today.

289
00:11:13,164 --> 00:11:15,690
I didn't know
if you were coming back at all.

290
00:11:15,715 --> 00:11:18,645
Thank you,
for all of your help last month.

291
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:20,697
I was in bad shape, but I am better now.

292
00:11:20,722 --> 00:11:21,882
I'm rested,

293
00:11:21,907 --> 00:11:23,315
and I'm seeing someone
on a regular basis and...

294
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:25,293
I mean I didn't know if you were
coming back to Grey-Sloan.

295
00:11:25,906 --> 00:11:29,798
I thought you might join
the other Dr. Karev

296
00:11:29,823 --> 00:11:31,966
in his new... endeavor.

297
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:34,817
Oh, well, he did offer me
my own fellowship,

298
00:11:34,842 --> 00:11:37,494
- with no oversight, but, um...
- Did he?

299
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:39,060
Well, as it happens,

300
00:11:39,085 --> 00:11:41,042
my plate is fuller than ever

301
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:43,557
with all the groundbreaking
things we do here.

302
00:11:43,573 --> 00:11:47,990
So, um, I will need to take
a step back from the fellowship,

303
00:11:48,014 --> 00:11:52,053
and give you more free rein
to pursue and develop

304
00:11:52,077 --> 00:11:54,011
as you see fit.
Does that sound appealing?

305
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:57,209
Um...

306
00:11:57,233 --> 00:11:58,495
I-I...

307
00:11:58,519 --> 00:11:59,920
Take the day. Think about it.

308
00:11:59,944 --> 00:12:00,963
Let me know.

309
00:12:04,358 --> 00:12:05,721
Uh, I-I'm sorry.

310
00:12:05,745 --> 00:12:07,127
How... How... How do you know Meredith?

311
00:12:07,151 --> 00:12:08,567
Community work crew.

312
00:12:08,591 --> 00:12:11,390
She said to come here,
ask for Dr. Webber.

313
00:12:11,414 --> 00:12:12,656
He would get a CT of my head.

314
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,560
Uh, what's wrong with your head?

315
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,170
I was running really fast,
away from these people,

316
00:12:16,194 --> 00:12:18,239
because they thought that
I had stolen someone's car.

317
00:12:18,263 --> 00:12:20,212
- But I...
- Uh, you know, n-never mind.

318
00:12:20,236 --> 00:12:22,183
Uh, uh, hang tight.

319
00:12:23,484 --> 00:12:24,824
Dr. Brown to Imaging.
Dr. Brown to Imaging.

320
00:12:24,848 --> 00:12:25,901
I need a pen.

321
00:12:25,925 --> 00:12:27,527
Uh, where are the CT orders?

322
00:12:27,551 --> 00:12:30,193
- Uh, CT's out.
- What do you mean, "out"?

323
00:12:30,217 --> 00:12:31,409
Broken, I guess.

324
00:12:31,434 --> 00:12:33,446
Well, shouldn't we close to trauma, then?

325
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:35,355
What?

326
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:36,933
Should we close to trauma?

327
00:12:36,934 --> 00:12:38,717
Look, I asked an hour ago,

328
00:12:38,741 --> 00:12:41,707
but, uh, rigs keep showing up
with some more patients.

329
00:12:41,731 --> 00:12:43,029
- Oh, man.
- Do we have pens?!

330
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:45,513
- Any pens that work?!
- Oh, my God.

331
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:47,355
Hey, are you Dr. Webber?

332
00:12:47,379 --> 00:12:50,113
Um, can I help you?

333
00:12:50,137 --> 00:12:51,884
I'm friends with Meredith Grey.

334
00:12:51,908 --> 00:12:54,005
Dear God.

335
00:12:54,029 --> 00:12:56,414
So, what you want
to do is go to Pac-North.

336
00:12:56,415 --> 00:12:59,588
You want to see either
Alex Karev or Richard Webber.

337
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,986
Tell them you're a friend
of Meredith Grey's

338
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:04,697
and you want to get
an ultrasound on that leg.

339
00:13:04,721 --> 00:13:06,857
- Okay.
- Okay.

340
00:13:06,858 --> 00:13:08,155
You got my stuff?

341
00:13:08,179 --> 00:13:11,039
Lidocaine, gauze, uh,
scalpels, bandages, saline.

342
00:13:11,063 --> 00:13:12,430
Am I gonna get arrested?

343
00:13:12,454 --> 00:13:14,376
I feel like I'm gonna get arrested.

344
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,242
- For what?
- I just stole from the hospital.

345
00:13:16,266 --> 00:13:18,546
I own the hospital. That's my stuff.

346
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:20,111
You just brought me my stuff.

347
00:13:20,135 --> 00:13:21,258
Go set it up.

348
00:13:21,282 --> 00:13:22,913
- Who's next?
- Hey!

349
00:13:22,937 --> 00:13:25,299
So, not only are you not
picking up trash,

350
00:13:25,323 --> 00:13:27,911
but these "patients" aren't, either.

351
00:13:27,912 --> 00:13:29,521
Who are you?

352
00:13:30,001 --> 00:13:32,371
I don't want to answer.

353
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:35,612
This isn't a walk-in clinic, Grey!

354
00:13:35,612 --> 00:13:36,631
Get back to work.

355
00:13:36,655 --> 00:13:38,090
Come on, let's go, guys.

356
00:13:38,114 --> 00:13:39,217
Get back to work.

357
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:41,211
People, let's go!

358
00:13:41,235 --> 00:13:42,913
Get back to work!

359
00:13:44,953 --> 00:13:48,057
How long have you had
that lump on your neck?

360
00:13:48,081 --> 00:13:49,865
I noticed it while you were swallowing.

361
00:13:49,889 --> 00:13:51,748
It's a nodule. It's oval-shaped.

362
00:13:52,773 --> 00:13:55,495
I could take a look at it
for you if you want.

363
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:57,172
Or I could get back to work.

364
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:05,128
Who can tell me the most difficult part

365
00:14:05,152 --> 00:14:07,223
of an ax-bi-fem bypass?

366
00:14:07,247 --> 00:14:09,612
Subcutaneously tunneling the graft?

367
00:14:09,636 --> 00:14:10,690
Wrong.

368
00:14:10,714 --> 00:14:12,775
Your prize... rectals for the week.

369
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:17,050
Next incorrect answer gets
to empty bed pans in the ICU.

370
00:14:17,074 --> 00:14:18,301
Helm?

371
00:14:18,841 --> 00:14:22,368
Uh, is it anastomosing the graft
to the axillary artery?

372
00:14:22,392 --> 00:14:24,071
Congratulations.

373
00:14:24,095 --> 00:14:27,268
And that is why you see
vascular instruments

374
00:14:27,292 --> 00:14:29,736
and PTFE grafts in front of you.

375
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,952
Dr. Bailey.

376
00:14:30,976 --> 00:14:32,062
D... What?

377
00:14:32,062 --> 00:14:33,811
Dr. Grey uses Dacron grafts.

378
00:14:33,835 --> 00:14:36,453
And I don't. Is there a question?
I didn't think so.

379
00:14:36,477 --> 00:14:39,303
For the rest of you, studies have shown

380
00:14:39,327 --> 00:14:43,195
that one synthetic material
is not superior to another

381
00:14:43,219 --> 00:14:44,453
in this procedure.

382
00:14:44,477 --> 00:14:48,721
Now, the first person
to complete perfect anastomoses

383
00:14:48,745 --> 00:14:50,668
gets to do it in the OR.

384
00:14:52,882 --> 00:14:54,005
You just confirmed

385
00:14:54,029 --> 00:14:55,785
that it was the hardest part
of the surgery.

386
00:14:55,809 --> 00:14:57,932
Then if I were you, I'd start practicing.

387
00:15:01,606 --> 00:15:03,344
Joy.

388
00:15:05,423 --> 00:15:06,476
Well, Reid, it looks like
you've gotten away

389
00:15:06,501 --> 00:15:07,903
with a few fractures near your sternum.

390
00:15:07,928 --> 00:15:09,641
You are extremely lucky.

391
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:11,327
I mean, so is she.

392
00:15:11,581 --> 00:15:13,434
You're the one who hit me.

393
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:16,103
- Hit you?
- I could have died.

394
00:15:16,127 --> 00:15:17,763
You were the one who ran him over?

395
00:15:17,764 --> 00:15:19,095
I-I was sitting still.

396
00:15:19,119 --> 00:15:21,424
You were the one who recklessly
scootered into my car,

397
00:15:21,448 --> 00:15:22,953
like a squirrel with a death wish.

398
00:15:25,931 --> 00:15:27,623
Okay. No pulse.

399
00:15:27,647 --> 00:15:30,843
- What the hell happened?
- Ultrasound. He was just stable.

400
00:15:30,867 --> 00:15:32,928
Show me the films. And did you do an EKG?

401
00:15:32,952 --> 00:15:34,493
No, I just saw rib fractures.

402
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:36,926
Okay. Let me see that.

403
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:38,872
Okay, cardiac tamponade.

404
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:40,123
Let's get a chest rig.

405
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:41,757
We need to open him up right away.

406
00:15:45,465 --> 00:15:47,214
Link.

407
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:50,412
I am being treated like a commodity.

408
00:15:50,436 --> 00:15:53,782
Like, I-I came back expecting
rare-bird looks,

409
00:15:53,806 --> 00:15:55,381
and instead, I am being offered

410
00:15:55,405 --> 00:15:57,652
total creative control over my fellowship

411
00:15:57,676 --> 00:15:59,076
by two different hospitals.

412
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,486
I mean, this doesn't make any sense.

413
00:16:02,609 --> 00:16:05,227
Link? Hey. Are you okay?

414
00:16:06,324 --> 00:16:08,055
Pregnant.

415
00:16:09,034 --> 00:16:10,990
Amelia's pregnant.

416
00:16:11,254 --> 00:16:12,761
From me.

417
00:16:12,785 --> 00:16:14,442
Whoa.

418
00:16:14,466 --> 00:16:15,642
Okay.

419
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:19,061
Have you two decided what you want to do?

420
00:16:19,085 --> 00:16:20,190
We didn't get that far.

421
00:16:20,214 --> 00:16:23,341
She, uh... She got paged to a case.

422
00:16:25,717 --> 00:16:28,473
I guess she's got
some bad history with pregnancy,

423
00:16:28,498 --> 00:16:31,599
so maybe she wants to keep it?

424
00:16:36,472 --> 00:16:37,596
Turn your head.

425
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:39,690
I noticed it at my dad's birthday dinner,

426
00:16:39,715 --> 00:16:41,542
which was about a few months ago.

427
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:42,968
It hurt to cough.

428
00:16:43,575 --> 00:16:45,613
My primary care physician looked at it.

429
00:16:45,638 --> 00:16:47,178
You need to see an ENT.

430
00:16:47,203 --> 00:16:48,732
That's exactly what she said.

431
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:51,282
But insurance took two weeks
to authorize a specialist.

432
00:16:51,307 --> 00:16:52,534
And when I called,

433
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:54,759
the soonest they could fit me in
was November.

434
00:16:54,784 --> 00:16:57,575
Okay, well, I know someone
who can see you right now.

435
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,766
The crew has two hours left in the day.

436
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:01,296
You have two hours left.

437
00:17:01,321 --> 00:17:03,140
Who's gonna know if we leave?

438
00:17:03,165 --> 00:17:05,018
I could lose my job!

439
00:17:05,043 --> 00:17:06,756
Cancer, Robin.

440
00:17:06,781 --> 00:17:08,795
This could be cancer.

441
00:17:10,716 --> 00:17:12,049
Yep.

442
00:17:12,074 --> 00:17:13,865
O-Okay. L-Let's go.

443
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:15,465
Schmitt, you're driving.

444
00:17:15,675 --> 00:17:17,354
On my bike?

445
00:17:22,622 --> 00:17:24,464
This is why I don't have
a resident today?

446
00:17:24,489 --> 00:17:25,964
- Bailey's holding boot camp?
- Mm-hmm.

447
00:17:25,989 --> 00:17:27,737
Uh, without Grey, Karev, and Webber,

448
00:17:27,762 --> 00:17:28,955
the pressure is on

449
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:30,972
to improve the caliber
of the surgical department.

450
00:17:30,997 --> 00:17:32,363
Sounds like a lot of work.

451
00:17:32,388 --> 00:17:33,720
I prefer not firing people.

452
00:17:33,745 --> 00:17:36,153
Also, I don't trust bottom
feeders to touch patients.

453
00:17:36,178 --> 00:17:37,615
That's why I don't teach.

454
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,457
- Hmm.
- It's a teaching hospital.

455
00:17:39,482 --> 00:17:42,761
Oh. ER. Good. This is boring.

456
00:17:42,786 --> 00:17:45,173
What does that man have over your mother?

457
00:17:45,847 --> 00:17:47,803
Probably just saving her life.

458
00:17:48,107 --> 00:17:49,253
Hmm.

459
00:17:50,491 --> 00:17:52,031
Done!

460
00:17:52,056 --> 00:17:54,407
Done! So done!

461
00:18:01,177 --> 00:18:03,754
All right, Helm will do
the anastomosis this afternoon.

462
00:18:03,779 --> 00:18:05,847
- What?
- I am so Meredith Grey.

463
00:18:05,872 --> 00:18:08,316
Dr. DeLuca, you'll still join us
in the surgery.

464
00:18:08,341 --> 00:18:10,424
Prep the patient and transport to OR 1.

465
00:18:16,602 --> 00:18:18,420
The patient has a fever...

466
00:18:18,445 --> 00:18:19,907
Okay. ...no abdominal pain,

467
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:21,976
the labs are normal, and a negative CT.

468
00:18:22,001 --> 00:18:24,306
Yet you paged me, a surgeon.

469
00:18:24,331 --> 00:18:25,732
Who should I page?

470
00:18:25,757 --> 00:18:27,423
Anyone but me.

471
00:18:28,378 --> 00:18:30,233
Mer, my ER's over capacity.

472
00:18:30,258 --> 00:18:33,244
You need to send your street
clinic to a different hospital.

473
00:18:34,564 --> 00:18:35,955
- Hey.
- Hey.

474
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:37,402
Everything okay? How's your day?

475
00:18:37,427 --> 00:18:40,710
Uh, it's weird, for a couple reasons.

476
00:18:40,735 --> 00:18:43,457
Um, Bailey made me
the same offer you did...

477
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:45,539
complete control over my fellowship.

478
00:18:45,564 --> 00:18:46,965
Did you ask her to do that?

479
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:48,299
Is that, like, another pity offer?

480
00:18:48,324 --> 00:18:49,670
What? No way.

481
00:18:49,689 --> 00:18:51,472
Bailey hates me right now.

482
00:18:51,496 --> 00:18:53,385
- Look, nobody's giving you any...
- Excuse me.

483
00:18:53,409 --> 00:18:54,467
Hi.

484
00:18:54,492 --> 00:18:55,997
Uh, you need to wait in the chairs.

485
00:18:56,022 --> 00:18:57,979
Look, Jo, if you don't want
to do the fellowship,

486
00:18:58,004 --> 00:19:00,656
um, I will make you full general
surgery attending right now.

487
00:19:01,332 --> 00:19:03,039
The only pity that needs to be shown

488
00:19:03,064 --> 00:19:04,569
is you coming here to help me.

489
00:19:04,594 --> 00:19:06,760
I'm really sorry to bother you again,

490
00:19:06,785 --> 00:19:08,544
but the guy sitting next to me...

491
00:19:08,569 --> 00:19:09,890
I think he's dead.

492
00:19:11,634 --> 00:19:13,069
I gotta call you back.

493
00:19:18,605 --> 00:19:19,825
Damn it!

494
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,955
Why is a rib fracture in a trauma room?

495
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,972
And furthermore,
why is a rib fracture filleted?

496
00:19:26,997 --> 00:19:28,746
Turns out the rib hit the heart.

497
00:19:28,771 --> 00:19:30,336
Suture. We need
to temporize the bleeding.

498
00:19:30,361 --> 00:19:31,415
We still don't have good pressure.

499
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,397
Just give it a second.

500
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:34,924
- V-Fib.
- Paddles.

501
00:19:35,231 --> 00:19:36,602
Simms, come to trauma two.

502
00:19:36,627 --> 00:19:38,869
See someone save a life without
turning him into a sauté.

503
00:19:39,539 --> 00:19:41,635
This guy can't die.

504
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:43,682
I could be charged with manslaughter

505
00:19:43,707 --> 00:19:44,696
or vehicular homicide.

506
00:19:44,721 --> 00:19:46,534
Clear!

507
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,516
You didn't hit him. He hit you.

508
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:50,220
I can't go to jail right now.

509
00:19:50,245 --> 00:19:51,541
Mer's already on the verge,

510
00:19:51,566 --> 00:19:53,315
and if I'm in jail and she's in jail,

511
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:54,567
then Amelia has the kids

512
00:19:54,592 --> 00:19:56,181
and she cannot handle that right now.

513
00:19:56,206 --> 00:19:57,225
What's wrong with Amelia?

514
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:58,531
Uh, nothing.

515
00:19:58,556 --> 00:19:59,714
Charge to 20.

516
00:19:59,739 --> 00:20:00,966
Clear.

517
00:20:04,205 --> 00:20:05,780
So, he was just half dead in the ER?

518
00:20:05,805 --> 00:20:06,928
Mm-hmm.

519
00:20:06,953 --> 00:20:09,150
Left gastric artery's compromised.

520
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,661
There's a small area of necrosis here.

521
00:20:11,686 --> 00:20:13,608
Karev, careful.
You're using too much traction.

522
00:20:13,633 --> 00:20:15,764
If I go any slower, the entire
stomach won't be viable.

523
00:20:15,789 --> 00:20:18,337
And if you perforate it,
he'll be more septic and die.

524
00:20:18,362 --> 00:20:19,798
Do you want me to get someone
else in here?

525
00:20:19,823 --> 00:20:21,745
Because I'd be happy to tag out
and get you another assist.

526
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:23,449
With one of your subpar
residents? No, thank you.

527
00:20:23,474 --> 00:20:24,701
My subpar residents?

528
00:20:24,726 --> 00:20:26,475
I'm only here because you told
me to come get this job.

529
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,227
I know this, Karev.

530
00:20:28,252 --> 00:20:30,000
That doesn't mean I want to work here.

531
00:20:30,025 --> 00:20:31,635
You told me to hire you.

532
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:34,034
I was 15 minutes late
for work this morning,

533
00:20:34,059 --> 00:20:35,773
and I'm never late.

534
00:20:35,798 --> 00:20:38,624
I find it to be an indicator of laziness.

535
00:20:38,649 --> 00:20:40,884
But I got into my car this morning,

536
00:20:40,909 --> 00:20:43,979
and I drove to Grey-Sloan
because for the past 35 years,

537
00:20:44,004 --> 00:20:45,926
that's where I've driven every day.

538
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:48,882
I spent more of my life in that
building than in my own home.

539
00:20:48,907 --> 00:20:51,072
It's where I was called "Dr. Webber"

540
00:20:51,097 --> 00:20:52,777
for the very first time.

541
00:20:52,802 --> 00:20:55,463
I figured one day I would just
drop dead in OR 2,

542
00:20:55,488 --> 00:20:57,202
and the thought of that made me happy.

543
00:20:57,227 --> 00:20:59,392
So, no, Karev, I don't want to work here.

544
00:20:59,417 --> 00:21:01,468
I want to work at my hospital!

545
00:21:01,469 --> 00:21:03,309
That is no longer an option.

546
00:21:06,335 --> 00:21:09,578
I started chemo when I was 10,
then radiation,

547
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:11,872
then more chemo, and so on.

548
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:14,201
I spent my entire childhood
getting poked and prodded

549
00:21:14,225 --> 00:21:15,522
and listening to my parents fight.

550
00:21:15,546 --> 00:21:17,607
Link, that's not gonna
happen to your kid.

551
00:21:17,631 --> 00:21:20,109
Your cancer wasn't even genetic.

552
00:21:20,133 --> 00:21:23,516
It was random, which is...
I swear to God it's worse.

553
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:25,879
There's no way to prepare.
I mean, forget cancer.

554
00:21:25,903 --> 00:21:27,978
What sane person turns on
the news and thinks,

555
00:21:28,003 --> 00:21:30,725
"Oh, great, the...
the polar ice caps are melting.

556
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:33,895
The planet is on fire,
and all of humanity is whining

557
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:36,780
on Twitter while doing exactly
nothing to prevent any of it.

558
00:21:36,805 --> 00:21:40,466
So, yeah, yeah, I should bring
a baby into this world"?

559
00:21:40,491 --> 00:21:42,993
Sometimes I forget how dark
your dark streak is.

560
00:21:44,275 --> 00:21:49,047
It's her choice, so, uh

561
00:21:49,072 --> 00:21:52,385
If she wants to have this kid,
do I say any of this?

562
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:54,262
It's her body, her choice, yes.

563
00:21:54,287 --> 00:21:56,257
But you're a person, too.
You get to weigh in.

564
00:22:03,281 --> 00:22:04,843
It's Amelia.

565
00:22:13,227 --> 00:22:14,650
Wait, Link.

566
00:22:16,652 --> 00:22:18,888
You're an excellent friend.

567
00:22:18,913 --> 00:22:22,572
And if it comes down to it,
you will be an excellent dad.

568
00:22:26,387 --> 00:22:28,935
Jo, if people are treating you
like a commodity,

569
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,118
it's because you are.

570
00:22:37,306 --> 00:22:40,564
Don't get fired, don't get
fired, don't get fired.

571
00:22:40,589 --> 00:22:42,469
Why are we in the parking lot?

572
00:22:43,067 --> 00:22:44,433
It's a long story.

573
00:22:44,458 --> 00:22:45,824
But don't you work here?

574
00:22:45,849 --> 00:22:47,529
She used to work here.

575
00:22:47,554 --> 00:22:49,331
It was a whole thing. Very dramatic.

576
00:22:49,356 --> 00:22:50,897
Why do I think this must be related

577
00:22:50,922 --> 00:22:52,948
to why you're on my work crew?

578
00:22:52,973 --> 00:22:55,578
It's not unrelated.
Can you hold still, please?

579
00:22:56,903 --> 00:22:59,382
Are you trying to lose your
medical license or what?

580
00:22:59,407 --> 00:23:00,912
So, Robin, this is Dr. Avery,

581
00:23:00,937 --> 00:23:03,590
- the ENT specialist I told you about.
- Yeah.

582
00:23:03,995 --> 00:23:06,856
Hey, so, Robin has an enlarging
mass in her neck.

583
00:23:06,881 --> 00:23:09,036
Ultrasound is showing
some concerning features.

584
00:23:09,061 --> 00:23:10,636
You think you could do a biopsy for me?

585
00:23:10,661 --> 00:23:12,791
- Now?
- It'll take you 20 minutes.

586
00:23:12,816 --> 00:23:14,183
I have surgeries scheduled.

587
00:23:14,208 --> 00:23:16,503
She's got an appointment in two
months with Clark at County.

588
00:23:16,528 --> 00:23:18,868
- Clark's an idiot.
- Right.

589
00:23:18,893 --> 00:23:20,733
Please.

590
00:23:22,405 --> 00:23:24,084
I'll see if I can move some stuff around.

591
00:23:24,109 --> 00:23:25,957
Will you not practice medicine
in the damn parking lot?

592
00:23:25,982 --> 00:23:27,765
Bailey's gonna see you.

593
00:23:30,814 --> 00:23:33,224
Okay. All right, let's start heparin,

594
00:23:33,249 --> 00:23:35,814
and then let's prepare for anastomoses.

595
00:23:39,518 --> 00:23:41,498
Angled DeBakey, please.

596
00:23:44,365 --> 00:23:46,600
I'll obtain proximal and distal control

597
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:48,789
before performing the arteriotomy.

598
00:23:48,814 --> 00:23:50,944
All right, now, remember,
the artery is fragile, okay?

599
00:23:50,969 --> 00:23:52,301
- So don't be too...
- Aggressive.

600
00:23:52,326 --> 00:23:53,832
- Right.
- I know.

601
00:23:53,864 --> 00:23:55,473
If anyone's gonna operate
from the sidelines,

602
00:23:55,497 --> 00:23:56,446
DeLuca, it'll be me.

603
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:57,918
- Dr. Bailey!
- Yes?

604
00:23:57,918 --> 00:23:59,563
I beat her. I beat her time.

605
00:23:59,587 --> 00:24:01,683
Should have beaten her by more
than one second, DeLuca.

606
00:24:01,707 --> 00:24:03,550
Helm, let's get to it.

607
00:24:10,146 --> 00:24:11,581
Oh, God.

608
00:24:11,606 --> 00:24:12,903
How many times have we shocked him?

609
00:24:12,928 --> 00:24:14,781
18 and multiple rounds of meds.
Come on. Come on.

610
00:24:14,806 --> 00:24:16,938
Another 50 joules.

611
00:24:16,963 --> 00:24:18,537
Clear.

612
00:24:21,207 --> 00:24:22,539
If I wasn't blaming myself for this,

613
00:24:22,564 --> 00:24:23,695
I would have called it by now,
wouldn't I?

614
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,874
You would and you should.

615
00:24:24,899 --> 00:24:26,229
Not only is he dead,
but you've charred his heart.

616
00:24:26,254 --> 00:24:27,617
- Give it up.
- Oh, God.

617
00:24:27,642 --> 00:24:29,183
Let me try, Pierce.

618
00:24:29,208 --> 00:24:31,053
Let's charge to 50, okay?

619
00:24:31,078 --> 00:24:32,931
And... clear!

620
00:24:32,956 --> 00:24:34,948
You know, if you two get off on this,

621
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:36,478
take a set of paddles down to the morgue,

622
00:24:36,503 --> 00:24:38,674
but at least free up my trauma
room. You hear me, Hunt?

623
00:24:38,699 --> 00:24:40,899
Charge again, and, clear.

624
00:24:40,924 --> 00:24:42,465
- We got a rhythm!
- Ohh!

625
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:44,238
Let's push epi, and let's get
him up to the OR now!

626
00:24:44,263 --> 00:24:46,603
Aah!

627
00:24:46,628 --> 00:24:48,202
Oh!

628
00:24:48,227 --> 00:24:50,654
Aaaah!

629
00:24:50,679 --> 00:24:51,942
- Oh!
- Crap.

630
00:24:51,967 --> 00:24:53,576
No, no, no, no.

631
00:24:53,601 --> 00:24:56,495
No. Mnh!

632
00:24:58,098 --> 00:24:59,709
That son of a bitch tried to kill me!

633
00:24:59,733 --> 00:25:00,881
Tom, you should really sit down.

634
00:25:00,905 --> 00:25:01,948
I physically can't!

635
00:25:01,972 --> 00:25:03,576
I had no idea you were behind me, Tom,

636
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,014
and the paddles were still charged.

637
00:25:05,038 --> 00:25:06,873
I was just trying
to resuscitate the patient.

638
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,267
You hit him with 50 joules
of electricity.

639
00:25:08,291 --> 00:25:09,518
What the hell is wrong with you?

640
00:25:09,542 --> 00:25:11,464
Simms, go find him a bed
and page urology.

641
00:25:11,488 --> 00:25:12,577
Page Catherine Fox.

642
00:25:12,601 --> 00:25:14,280
I'm not letting incompetence touch me.

643
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:16,192
No, no, no, no, no, no.

644
00:25:16,216 --> 00:25:17,812
Aah.

645
00:25:18,752 --> 00:25:23,004
Also, 25 disposable scalpels,
12 bulk packages of bandages,

646
00:25:23,028 --> 00:25:25,610
a lot of 4x4s, bags of saline.

647
00:25:25,634 --> 00:25:26,619
Why are you telling me all this?

648
00:25:26,643 --> 00:25:28,600
I'm a Gryffindor. I'm brave.

649
00:25:28,624 --> 00:25:29,815
I'm scared all the time,

650
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:32,423
but I am brave and sometimes stupid.

651
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:34,404
So, when Dr. Grey called, I went.

652
00:25:34,428 --> 00:25:38,435
I just do not want to lose
my license or go to jail.

653
00:25:38,459 --> 00:25:41,529
So, when Chief Bailey asks me
why I took those supplies,

654
00:25:41,553 --> 00:25:46,111
I'm hoping maybe you could say
you asked me for them.

655
00:25:49,573 --> 00:25:50,870
Fine.

656
00:25:50,895 --> 00:25:52,368
Here's a sample.

657
00:25:53,086 --> 00:25:55,529
Fine? Really?

658
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:58,624
Meredith Grey's a good friend
and the best doctor I know.

659
00:25:58,649 --> 00:26:00,085
I'm not scared of getting in
a little bit of trouble

660
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:01,950
if that means she's helping someone.

661
00:26:03,575 --> 00:26:04,942
Also a Gryffindor.

662
00:26:09,591 --> 00:26:11,409
I named him Christopher.

663
00:26:11,434 --> 00:26:14,890
I, uh, donated his organs,

664
00:26:15,757 --> 00:26:18,852
and it was the hardest thing
I've ever gone through.

665
00:26:19,527 --> 00:26:23,941
So, the thought of being
pregnant again, um,

666
00:26:24,419 --> 00:26:27,627
the idea of reliving it, it just, um...

667
00:26:27,652 --> 00:26:29,488
it was always paralyzing.

668
00:26:31,415 --> 00:26:35,111
That is why I am militant
about birth control.

669
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:37,822
I mean, I've honestly
been on it for so long

670
00:26:37,847 --> 00:26:41,021
I barely get a period anymore,
which is why

671
00:26:41,046 --> 00:26:45,910
it took me a while to notice... this.

672
00:26:49,789 --> 00:26:53,345
And I've had a long time to process it,

673
00:26:54,725 --> 00:26:56,140
to grieve him.

674
00:26:58,449 --> 00:27:03,313
But... even though I, uh...

675
00:27:03,802 --> 00:27:06,906
I'm in a privileged situation now, I'm...

676
00:27:06,931 --> 00:27:10,765
with my sobriety and with my career,

677
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:15,534
and even though I could
give a kid a good life,

678
00:27:17,935 --> 00:27:21,873
I just don't think that's
a reason to have a child.

679
00:27:21,898 --> 00:27:23,459
And, um...

680
00:27:25,377 --> 00:27:28,846
And even though the odds of
what happened with Christopher

681
00:27:28,871 --> 00:27:31,836
ever happening again
are like a million to one,

682
00:27:31,861 --> 00:27:33,302
I...

683
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,415
I just...

684
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,772
I know I wouldn't survive it.

685
00:27:37,797 --> 00:27:39,219
So, um...

686
00:27:47,885 --> 00:27:49,634
Sorry.

687
00:28:00,229 --> 00:28:02,636
And, uh, I know it's my body,

688
00:28:02,661 --> 00:28:06,115
but, uh, you are free to have feelings.

689
00:28:10,002 --> 00:28:11,381
Um...

690
00:28:13,535 --> 00:28:15,677
Um...

691
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:22,518
I've spent the day trying to
wrap my head around this, um,

692
00:28:24,465 --> 00:28:28,196
imagining worst-case scenarios

693
00:28:28,221 --> 00:28:31,220
if we actually went through with this,

694
00:28:31,245 --> 00:28:32,681
a-and I've got about a million of them.

695
00:28:32,706 --> 00:28:35,614
Cancer, uh, global warming,

696
00:28:35,952 --> 00:28:38,867
gun violence,
antibiotic resistant superbugs.

697
00:28:39,305 --> 00:28:44,623
But, um, talking to you now,
looking at you,

698
00:28:45,699 --> 00:28:49,211
listening to you, and hearing
what you have survived, I...

699
00:28:49,874 --> 00:28:52,464
What I know I don't want

700
00:28:54,303 --> 00:28:56,385
is for anything to hurt you.

701
00:28:57,362 --> 00:29:00,597
That feels real to me.
That feels tangible.

702
00:29:01,268 --> 00:29:05,077
And everything that scares me
suddenly feels irrelevant.

703
00:29:05,361 --> 00:29:11,002
So... if you want to have this kid,

704
00:29:11,026 --> 00:29:14,895
I-I will suck up my fears and
I'll be a dad because

705
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:17,406
Well, I mean, let's be honest.
Kids love me.

706
00:29:17,784 --> 00:29:20,019
And, um, if you don't want it,

707
00:29:20,044 --> 00:29:23,635
I-I, um... I'll drive you
to the appointment.

708
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:27,124
I will be there for you
in every way I possibly can.

709
00:29:29,016 --> 00:29:30,069
That's what I know.

710
00:29:30,094 --> 00:29:32,468
That's ... That's my feelings.

711
00:29:43,024 --> 00:29:44,807
Damn it, Link!

712
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:56,459
And... done.

713
00:29:56,484 --> 00:29:57,850
Ready to tie.

714
00:29:59,446 --> 00:30:00,514
Awesome.

715
00:30:00,539 --> 00:30:02,659
Time to remove the first clamp.

716
00:30:03,521 --> 00:30:05,203
And flush the graft.

717
00:30:06,987 --> 00:30:09,041
The graft is...

718
00:30:12,289 --> 00:30:13,629
...good.

719
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:16,261
Mm-hmm.

720
00:30:16,286 --> 00:30:17,547
Air's out.

721
00:30:17,572 --> 00:30:19,321
Now for the second one.

722
00:30:21,224 --> 00:30:22,313
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Why... Why's he bleeding?

723
00:30:22,338 --> 00:30:23,391
Where's it from?

724
00:30:23,416 --> 00:30:25,086
Uh, seems to be coming
from your suture line.

725
00:30:25,111 --> 00:30:26,180
Suction. What?!

726
00:30:26,205 --> 00:30:27,327
There's so much blood.

727
00:30:27,352 --> 00:30:28,753
Do something. Fix it.

728
00:30:28,778 --> 00:30:29,995
Why aren't you fixing it?!

729
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:31,387
Can you fix it?!

730
00:30:31,412 --> 00:30:32,987
I don't know. Can I?

731
00:30:33,012 --> 00:30:35,108
Oh, God. Ohh.

732
00:30:35,133 --> 00:30:36,222
DeLuca.

733
00:30:36,247 --> 00:30:38,074
He's bleeding out too fast, Bailey.

734
00:30:38,099 --> 00:30:40,290
So, what do you do?

735
00:30:40,315 --> 00:30:41,865
Aah...

736
00:30:42,736 --> 00:30:43,859
Clamps.

737
00:30:43,884 --> 00:30:45,827
I'll get proximal and distal control.

738
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:48,049
All right. Ahh.

739
00:30:48,074 --> 00:30:50,205
All right, coming around.

740
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:52,256
6-0 Prolene. Right now. Come on.

741
00:31:01,521 --> 00:31:04,209
- Thyroid cancer?
- Papillary thyroid cancer.

742
00:31:04,233 --> 00:31:06,677
It's the most common
and the most treatable.

743
00:31:06,701 --> 00:31:08,902
You'll need surgery,
possible iodine treatments,

744
00:31:08,926 --> 00:31:12,551
but all of it's perfectly doable.

745
00:31:12,575 --> 00:31:14,324
If it wasn't for you,
I'd still be waiting

746
00:31:14,348 --> 00:31:16,409
two months to get checked.

747
00:31:16,433 --> 00:31:19,606
And that's if I could
afford the time off.

748
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:22,526
If I miss work, I don't get paid.

749
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:26,628
And if I don't get paid, I can't pay rent

750
00:31:26,652 --> 00:31:29,060
or I can't pay for my asthma medication.

751
00:31:29,084 --> 00:31:31,285
Insurance doesn't cover
the cost of the inhaler?

752
00:31:31,309 --> 00:31:33,787
They'll cover one per month.

753
00:31:33,811 --> 00:31:37,506
I shell out $500 a month
if I need another one,

754
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:39,731
which I'm guessing may be cheap

755
00:31:39,755 --> 00:31:42,059
compared to what it costs
to treat cancer.

756
00:31:42,083 --> 00:31:45,292
We'll make sure you're given
options to consider.

757
00:31:45,316 --> 00:31:46,822
Yeah.

758
00:31:46,846 --> 00:31:49,428
Bankruptcy or death.

759
00:31:49,452 --> 00:31:51,790
Dr. Grey? Are you back?

760
00:31:51,814 --> 00:31:53,103
Is she back?

761
00:31:53,867 --> 00:31:55,232
I'm visiting a friend, Helm.

762
00:31:55,256 --> 00:31:56,586
Walk, Helm.

763
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:03,261
So, we were able to repair
the hole in his heart,

764
00:32:03,285 --> 00:32:05,282
but it'll be a long road to recovery.

765
00:32:06,934 --> 00:32:08,613
He steals my credit cards.

766
00:32:08,638 --> 00:32:12,195
He lives in my apartment
and eats my food.

767
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:14,350
Why do I stay with him?

768
00:32:14,375 --> 00:32:16,501
Because at one point, things were good.

769
00:32:17,246 --> 00:32:19,065
He made you laugh.
You were attracted to him.

770
00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:22,680
And maybe a quiet part
inside of you raised a red flag

771
00:32:22,705 --> 00:32:24,072
here or there, but you ignored it because

772
00:32:24,097 --> 00:32:26,158
dating in today's world is miserable.

773
00:32:26,183 --> 00:32:28,661
It's digital and terrifying,
and, let's be honest,

774
00:32:28,686 --> 00:32:31,200
the pickings are slim for an
educated, independent woman.

775
00:32:31,225 --> 00:32:32,278
So you stayed.

776
00:32:32,303 --> 00:32:34,352
But, Tara, the longer you stay,

777
00:32:34,377 --> 00:32:35,805
the harder it will be to leave.

778
00:32:35,836 --> 00:32:37,998
And maybe you think
that he will leave first,

779
00:32:38,023 --> 00:32:39,876
but if he does that,
then you'll just feel like

780
00:32:39,901 --> 00:32:42,067
a victim, which I think is worse

781
00:32:42,092 --> 00:32:45,287
than just ripping off
the Band-Aid yourself.

782
00:32:50,547 --> 00:32:51,636
Thanks.

783
00:32:51,661 --> 00:32:54,069
Hey. Our guy's stable.
His wife's on the way.

784
00:32:54,094 --> 00:32:56,391
Well, it's nice that one
thing went right today.

785
00:32:56,416 --> 00:32:57,720
Yeah.

786
00:32:57,745 --> 00:32:59,612
Hey, Dr. Webber.

787
00:32:59,637 --> 00:33:01,316
I-I didn't want to work here, either.

788
00:33:01,341 --> 00:33:04,445
You know, at Grey-Sloan,
I inherited a-a legacy.

789
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:06,254
Bailey's legacy, your legacy.

790
00:33:06,279 --> 00:33:07,575
You know, I mean, every choice I made,

791
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,635
I heard your voice in my head...
"Don't settle. Do better."

792
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:12,931
At Grey-Sloan,
failing was our last option.

793
00:33:12,956 --> 00:33:14,843
But here, failure's the culture.

794
00:33:14,868 --> 00:33:17,068
But we can change that.

795
00:33:17,093 --> 00:33:19,190
I mean, dying in an OR
at Grey-Sloan is one plan,

796
00:33:19,215 --> 00:33:21,525
but maybe there is a better plan
for you here.

797
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:23,472
A new legacy.

798
00:33:23,497 --> 00:33:25,280
Help me turn this place around.

799
00:33:25,305 --> 00:33:27,262
Help me do the impossible.

800
00:33:27,287 --> 00:33:29,280
H-Help me prove Bailey wrong.

801
00:33:34,478 --> 00:33:35,747
Yeah.

802
00:33:37,159 --> 00:33:38,698
Oh, I, uh... I almost forgot.

803
00:33:38,722 --> 00:33:43,182
I had to pull some strings with
maintenance, but, uh, ta-da!

804
00:33:43,206 --> 00:33:44,456
Your office.

805
00:33:45,824 --> 00:33:47,886
Karev! Do better!

806
00:34:05,416 --> 00:34:06,731
You're wrong, you know?

807
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:11,241
Excuse me?

808
00:34:13,279 --> 00:34:14,645
What you said about Vic.

809
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:19,582
She's really smart, Maggie,
and she's brave.

810
00:34:19,607 --> 00:34:21,322
And you're right.

811
00:34:21,347 --> 00:34:23,686
She is different from me.

812
00:34:25,241 --> 00:34:26,965
I don't think that's a bad thing.

813
00:34:27,744 --> 00:34:31,023
I'm sorry for what I said.

814
00:34:31,048 --> 00:34:34,698
Even so, "#Freedom"
is a little aggressive.

815
00:34:34,723 --> 00:34:37,434
I wasn't being consciously spiteful.

816
00:34:37,459 --> 00:34:40,041
Unconsciously, then?

817
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,227
You hear that, Wade?

818
00:34:49,252 --> 00:34:51,244
It's the sound of blood
flowing through your body.

819
00:34:51,269 --> 00:34:53,122
- That's good.
- That's right.

820
00:35:00,538 --> 00:35:03,260
Monitor proximal
and distal pulses every hour.

821
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:05,358
Really? That's it?

822
00:35:05,383 --> 00:35:06,714
Nothing else to say?

823
00:35:06,739 --> 00:35:09,591
What? Oh, you want praise?

824
00:35:09,616 --> 00:35:12,234
Um, good work, Dr. DeLuca.

825
00:35:12,259 --> 00:35:13,868
You did your job.

826
00:35:13,893 --> 00:35:15,329
You let someone who wasn't ready

827
00:35:15,354 --> 00:35:17,450
do the most critical part of his surgery.

828
00:35:17,475 --> 00:35:19,537
I should have been doing that
anastomosis from the beginning.

829
00:35:19,562 --> 00:35:21,831
But instead, you sidelined me

830
00:35:21,856 --> 00:35:23,883
because of my relationship
with Meredith Grey.

831
00:35:23,908 --> 00:35:25,607
Excuse me?

832
00:35:25,632 --> 00:35:28,250
I aced that skills lab, Bailey.

833
00:35:28,275 --> 00:35:30,232
My suture technique
was far more advanced...

834
00:35:30,257 --> 00:35:31,902
Helm needed the practice!

835
00:35:31,927 --> 00:35:34,509
She needed the adrenaline
and the fear because all of that

836
00:35:34,534 --> 00:35:35,865
is what makes you a surgeon!

837
00:35:35,890 --> 00:35:37,605
And don't you dare question my methods!

838
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:41,429
This is not personal, DeLuca!
Unless you make it personal.

839
00:35:41,454 --> 00:35:44,326
If I were you, I'd start
thinking about my career

840
00:35:44,351 --> 00:35:47,303
and let go of certain... loyalties.

841
00:35:54,292 --> 00:35:56,528
Dr. Lawson, extension 2290.

842
00:35:56,553 --> 00:35:58,197
Dr. Lawson, extension 2290.

843
00:35:58,222 --> 00:36:00,492
Dr. Bailey? Hi, um, can you talk?

844
00:36:00,517 --> 00:36:01,779
Is now a bad time?

845
00:36:01,804 --> 00:36:04,873
I no longer have good times. What?

846
00:36:04,898 --> 00:36:08,066
I've taken the day,
and I've made my decision.

847
00:36:08,273 --> 00:36:11,309
I want to be a general surgery attending.

848
00:36:11,699 --> 00:36:13,899
I don't recall giving you that option.

849
00:36:13,924 --> 00:36:14,769
Did Tom Koracick...

850
00:36:14,794 --> 00:36:15,986
No one did.

851
00:36:16,011 --> 00:36:18,576
Well, no one here did.

852
00:36:19,059 --> 00:36:20,668
So, you're going to Pac-North?

853
00:36:20,693 --> 00:36:21,850
That's up to you.

854
00:36:21,875 --> 00:36:23,416
They've made me a tempting offer.

855
00:36:23,441 --> 00:36:24,702
Your husband.

856
00:36:24,727 --> 00:36:26,302
Their chief.

857
00:36:26,327 --> 00:36:27,520
They believe that I'm ready.

858
00:36:27,545 --> 00:36:29,502
I've trained under the best,
and most of whom

859
00:36:29,527 --> 00:36:30,772
no longer work here.

860
00:36:30,797 --> 00:36:33,762
I know how this place works.
I know how you work.

861
00:36:33,787 --> 00:36:35,049
And I'm ready.

862
00:36:35,074 --> 00:36:37,031
I would be an asset to any hospital.

863
00:36:37,056 --> 00:36:41,237
The question is... do you want
that hospital to be yours?

864
00:36:51,796 --> 00:36:53,545
Let's go to my office.

865
00:36:54,544 --> 00:36:55,771
Yes.

866
00:37:03,136 --> 00:37:08,168
Uh, hey. I wanted to apologize for the...

867
00:37:10,416 --> 00:37:13,138
I'm sorry, Tom, for the incident.

868
00:37:13,164 --> 00:37:14,635
- Incident?
- Yeah.

869
00:37:14,659 --> 00:37:16,025
You deep-fried my nads.

870
00:37:16,049 --> 00:37:19,257
It was an unfortunate accident, Tom,

871
00:37:19,281 --> 00:37:21,181
and I am very sorry, so...

872
00:37:22,088 --> 00:37:25,528
Actually, champ, I'm gonna need
you to step back a few feet.

873
00:37:26,418 --> 00:37:29,801
500 feet, if we're gonna be
sticklers about it.

874
00:37:29,826 --> 00:37:31,469
- Court orders.
- What?

875
00:37:31,494 --> 00:37:34,321
I've obtained an emergency
restraining order against you,

876
00:37:34,346 --> 00:37:36,616
Hunt, due to acute emotional
and physical distress.

877
00:37:36,641 --> 00:37:39,119
- Restraining order?
- If you need any clarification,

878
00:37:39,144 --> 00:37:42,038
feel free to reach out
to my attorney, Ron Brickman.

879
00:37:42,063 --> 00:37:43,814
He can answer any questions you have.

880
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:46,089
He's a good friend, hell
of a tennis player, actually.

881
00:37:46,114 --> 00:37:48,350
Tom, we work together.

882
00:37:48,375 --> 00:37:52,279
Shut the door on your way out, would you?

883
00:37:52,304 --> 00:37:54,380
Ohh.

884
00:38:01,694 --> 00:38:02,713
Ahh.

885
00:38:04,584 --> 00:38:07,654
...which is just a long-winded
way of saying thank you

886
00:38:07,679 --> 00:38:10,018
for the offer,
but I'm afraid I have to pass.

887
00:38:10,043 --> 00:38:12,869
Wait. You took my offer
to Bailey to get a better one?

888
00:38:12,894 --> 00:38:16,451
It didn't feel that calculated
in the moment, but basically.

889
00:38:16,476 --> 00:38:18,710
I feel used.
I know! I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

890
00:38:18,735 --> 00:38:21,353
But it's the smart choice.
The facility's better.

891
00:38:21,378 --> 00:38:24,169
The tech is cutting-edge.
Higher-profile patients.

892
00:38:24,194 --> 00:38:25,247
Look, you're making it sound like

893
00:38:25,272 --> 00:38:26,813
I'm the chief of a burger joint.

894
00:38:26,838 --> 00:38:28,205
Someone died in your waiting room.

895
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:29,561
Nobody died.

896
00:38:29,586 --> 00:38:31,091
Webber and I got to him in time.
He's fine.

897
00:38:31,116 --> 00:38:32,483
Okay, you're basically making

898
00:38:32,508 --> 00:38:34,045
my argument for me.

899
00:38:34,341 --> 00:38:35,950
All right, just make sure
you get a parking spot.

900
00:38:35,975 --> 00:38:39,636
Bailey's really tight with them,
so demand one.

901
00:38:39,661 --> 00:38:41,745
She gave me yours.

902
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:44,866
After we've been sick or hurt,
our bodies remember.

903
00:38:46,104 --> 00:38:47,679
So, he had them in... His nuts?!

904
00:38:50,487 --> 00:38:53,538
- Look, it's only funny because he's okay.
- Yep!

905
00:38:53,563 --> 00:38:55,354
We learn from the past

906
00:38:55,379 --> 00:38:57,533
and develop tools to help us cope.

907
00:38:58,692 --> 00:39:00,440
Basically, the more we go
through something,

908
00:39:00,465 --> 00:39:02,040
the better we can handle it
if it happens again.

909
00:39:12,663 --> 00:39:14,273
- Hi!
- Hey.

910
00:39:17,879 --> 00:39:19,975
Now, I heard a rumor you were
at the hospital today.

911
00:39:23,615 --> 00:39:26,268
I, uh, stumbled across
a patient at work crew.

912
00:39:26,293 --> 00:39:28,633
I actually have stumbled across

913
00:39:28,658 --> 00:39:30,937
a lot of patients at work crew.

914
00:39:30,962 --> 00:39:33,023
I know I got fired
for trying to help a kid

915
00:39:33,048 --> 00:39:34,449
who fell through the cracks.

916
00:39:34,474 --> 00:39:37,439
And as much as I try to keep
my head down and lay low

917
00:39:37,464 --> 00:39:41,256
and just get through my hours,
I keep coming across people

918
00:39:41,281 --> 00:39:44,949
who can't get the help they need
because of the same crap.

919
00:39:45,336 --> 00:39:47,049
They keep falling
through the same cracks.

920
00:39:47,074 --> 00:39:50,004
Okay, look, before you decide to
do whatever it is you're doing,

921
00:39:50,029 --> 00:39:52,195
okay, jail sucks. It's not fun.

922
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:54,595
You're not gonna be able to see
your kids or pee in private.

923
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:55,917
The water tastes like feet.
Should I go on?

924
00:39:55,942 --> 00:39:58,037
Okay, I'm not planning on going to jail.

925
00:39:58,062 --> 00:40:00,020
But what I'm planning to do
is write about what I'm seeing.

926
00:40:00,045 --> 00:40:01,428
You want to publish?

927
00:40:01,453 --> 00:40:02,446
I do.

928
00:40:02,471 --> 00:40:03,877
You're about to face the medical board.

929
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:04,921
I know.

930
00:40:04,946 --> 00:40:06,321
Didn't the lawyer say to lay low?

931
00:40:06,346 --> 00:40:08,477
Yes, but I-I-I don't think
I'm capable of that.

932
00:40:15,388 --> 00:40:16,823
What?

933
00:40:18,274 --> 00:40:19,814
Nothing. Nothing.

934
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:22,908
You're just very, very sexy

935
00:40:22,933 --> 00:40:24,612
when you're about to burn
your whole life down.

936
00:40:24,637 --> 00:40:26,108
You know that?

937
00:40:26,133 --> 00:40:28,618
<i>Our bodies are prepared to bounce back.</i>

938
00:40:28,924 --> 00:40:31,195
<i>Or so we think.</i>

939
00:40:45,162 --> 00:40:48,753
Did I... say the wrong thing?

940
00:40:51,608 --> 00:40:54,677
I had made up my mind.

941
00:40:55,978 --> 00:40:58,630
Because I was scared.

942
00:40:59,907 --> 00:41:02,941
Of what happened with
Christopher, and, um...

943
00:41:04,422 --> 00:41:05,791
...of doing this alone.

944
00:41:05,816 --> 00:41:08,297
And a million little things.

945
00:41:14,666 --> 00:41:16,101
I was scared.

946
00:41:18,873 --> 00:41:22,291
And then you said things.

947
00:41:23,931 --> 00:41:26,624
That made you less scared?

948
00:41:26,648 --> 00:41:31,516
Less scared and a little bit in love.

949
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:33,200
It's probably just the hormones.

950
00:41:35,043 --> 00:41:36,172
Probably.

951
00:41:36,203 --> 00:41:38,638
- Please don't say it back.
- Okay.

952
00:41:41,435 --> 00:41:43,475
You and I...

953
00:41:45,135 --> 00:41:47,391
We'd make an amazing kid.

954
00:41:49,330 --> 00:41:50,954
And now I kinda want to meet that kid.

955
00:41:52,158 --> 00:41:54,657
Well...

956
00:41:54,681 --> 00:41:56,533
I kinda do, too.

957
00:41:56,557 --> 00:41:59,180
<i>Sometimes an unknown
throws the whole thing off.</i>
