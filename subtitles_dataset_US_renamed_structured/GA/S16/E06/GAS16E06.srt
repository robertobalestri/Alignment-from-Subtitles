Paula. What?

6
00:00:12,187 --> 00:00:13,382
You're scaring me.

7
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:15,101
Happy Halloween.

8
00:00:15,189 --> 00:00:17,195
Anybody ever tell you,
you snore like a trucker?

9
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:19,843
- Not in those exact words.
- Like a truck, then?

10
00:00:19,931 --> 00:00:21,599
I thought a semi
was barreling towards me.

11
00:00:21,687 --> 00:00:23,529
- You woke me up.
- I have allergies.

14
00:00:26,289 --> 00:00:27,537
Yes.
I'm getting out today.

15
00:00:27,625 --> 00:00:29,005
- I'm counting the minutes.
- Ooh!

16
00:00:29,093 --> 00:00:30,365
Well, I'll count, too.

17
00:00:30,453 --> 00:00:31,935

- What's this?

27
00:00:46,789 --> 00:00:48,211
My mom brought them

28
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:50,632
Costumes from when Megan and I
were little kids.

29
00:00:50,929 --> 00:00:52,265
These are amazing.

30
00:00:52,353 --> 00:00:54,070
Yeah. She made them
all from scratch.

31
00:00:54,316 --> 00:00:56,122
Your mom worked full-time

32
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:57,654

to make costumes?

Nothing's scarier
than my real life.

58
00:01:37,105 --> 00:01:40,098
I got half a dozen investors
coming to see Pac North today.

59
00:01:40,205 --> 00:01:42,127
Gotta convince them
to sink more money into it.

60
00:01:42,219 --> 00:01:44,578
You found a janitor
giving himself a CT scan.

61
00:01:44,666 --> 00:01:46,414
That place has nowhere to go
but up.

62
00:01:46,502 --> 00:01:48,742
Hey, have you seen
my wedding shoes?

63
00:01:48,829 --> 00:01:49,992

00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,171
Uh, it's expensive.

65
00:01:51,259 --> 00:01:52,250
I'm gonna wear it
every Halloween.

66
00:01:52,338 --> 00:01:53,633
- To work?
- No. I have the day off.

67
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,507
I'm gonna stay home,

68
00:01:54,595 --> 00:01:56,382
I'm gonna eat
most of the candy,

69
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:57,870
and scare
all the trick-or-treaters.

70
00:02:02,516 --> 00:02:03,931
- Love you.
- Love you.

71
00:02:06,829 --> 00:02:08,162
How come
my mom hasn't called

72
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:10,134
from sleepover
community service?

73
00:02:10,222 --> 00:02:12,088
Oh, she's probably busy.

74
00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:14,335
It's not like a slumber party
with friends.

75
00:02:14,585 --> 00:02:15,760
Oh. That's your ride.

76
00:02:15,847 --> 00:02:17,393
Okay, everybody,
get your stuff together.

77
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,784
Come on, guys.
Get your backpacks.

78
00:02:18,871 --> 00:02:19,830
I hope we get candy
at school.

79
00:02:19,918 --> 00:02:22,374
Oh, did you guys forget
your candy? Go get your candy.

80
00:02:22,462 --> 00:02:24,530
- Candy! Come on.
- Let's go, guys.

81
00:02:24,618 --> 00:02:26,195
- Hey. I am so sorry
- Hey.

82
00:02:26,283 --> 00:02:27,690
That I'm late.
I had to borrow Carina's car.

83
00:02:27,777 --> 00:02:28,781
How are the kids?

84
00:02:28,869 --> 00:02:30,750
Hair is brushed.
Lunches are packed.

85
00:02:30,838 --> 00:02:32,171
Halloween costumes are on.

86
00:02:32,259 --> 00:02:34,447
I am killing the auntie game,
right, ZoZo?

87
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,877
Yeah, but are you
gonna get dressed?

88
00:02:40,147 --> 00:02:41,390
Good idea.

89
00:02:41,783 --> 00:02:42,986
I'm gonna go get dressed,

90
00:02:43,074 --> 00:02:45,487
and Dr. DeLuca is gonna
take you to school, okay?

91
00:02:45,575 --> 00:02:47,028
Okay.

92
00:02:47,249 --> 00:02:48,412
Okay.

93
00:02:48,618 --> 00:02:49,529
Hey.

94
00:02:49,617 --> 00:02:51,478
- Need some help with that?
- Don't!

95
00:02:51,712 --> 00:02:53,072
You're not my dad.

96
00:02:54,557 --> 00:02:56,056
Okay.

97
00:02:56,292 --> 00:02:58,508
Alright, let's get the rest
of your stuff together, guys.

98
00:03:01,249 --> 00:03:03,150
Alright, let's go.

99
00:03:04,749 --> 00:03:06,412
And then I reminded her

100
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,765
that I'm going to Capitol Hill
with Nico for Halloween,

101
00:03:08,853 --> 00:03:10,362
and she got all weird.

102
00:03:10,449 --> 00:03:12,414
She's sad you're not helping her
hand out candy.

103
00:03:12,502 --> 00:03:13,703
Well, that's what
I thought,

104
00:03:13,791 --> 00:03:16,460
but then she asked me
not to post pictures.

105
00:03:16,548 --> 00:03:18,484
She said a lot of our family
follows me.

106
00:03:18,572 --> 00:03:20,078
She doesn't
want them to know

107
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:21,347
you still dress up
for Halloween?

108
00:03:21,434 --> 00:03:23,531
Yeah, if by "still dress up
for Halloween"

109
00:03:23,619 --> 00:03:25,257
you mean "are gay,"

110
00:03:25,345 --> 00:03:26,492
then I think so.

111
00:03:26,579 --> 00:03:28,337
- I thought she was cool with it.
- Yeah.

112
00:03:28,425 --> 00:03:29,453
So did I.

113
00:03:30,652 --> 00:03:32,985
I'm not gonna let her
ruin Halloween.

114
00:03:33,289 --> 00:03:34,572
I'm gonna power
through rounds

115
00:03:34,659 --> 00:03:36,734
so that I can leave early
and meet Nico.

116
00:03:36,822 --> 00:03:38,736
Mm. What's your costume?

117
00:03:39,036 --> 00:03:40,399
It's a paladin.

118
00:03:40,978 --> 00:03:42,447
From "Dungeons & Dragons."

119
00:03:42,535 --> 00:03:44,773
It's a subclass of fighter
who has the ability

120
00:03:44,861 --> 00:03:46,125
to heal wounds
and cure diseases.

121
00:03:46,212 --> 00:03:47,702
So it's a nerd suit.

122
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:49,421
They can detect evil.

123
00:03:49,509 --> 00:03:50,622
Oh.

124
00:03:52,497 --> 00:03:54,960
We, uh, revamped
ER triage protocols

125
00:03:55,048 --> 00:03:56,335
to improve patient flow.

126
00:03:56,423 --> 00:03:57,952
That reduced wait times
by 10%.

127
00:03:58,039 --> 00:04:00,162
Okay, no more candy corn
in your nose, bud.

128
00:04:01,509 --> 00:04:02,923
Got it.

129
00:04:04,775 --> 00:04:07,119
Oh, no, no, no,
don't do... that.

130
00:04:07,931 --> 00:04:09,025
Uh...

131
00:04:09,113 --> 00:04:12,312
Dr. Webber is, uh, enhancing
the education program

132
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,275
to include doctor-patient
communication

133
00:04:14,363 --> 00:04:15,728
and other soft skills.

134
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:17,806
And with, uh,
additional funding,

135
00:04:17,931 --> 00:04:19,514
we can upgrade
the skills lab

136
00:04:19,602 --> 00:04:21,236
to improve
surgical technique.

137
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:22,908
Well, unless there are
any questions,

138
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:25,369
we will go see construction
on the new research wing,

139
00:04:25,499 --> 00:04:27,984
which is not only on budget,
but ahead of schedule.

140
00:04:28,072 --> 00:04:29,478
Uh, Chief, a word?

141
00:04:29,566 --> 00:04:31,236
Uh, we're on our way
to you now, Eddie.

142
00:04:31,381 --> 00:04:32,862
I think there's something
you should see

143
00:04:32,949 --> 00:04:34,634
before anyone else does.

144
00:04:34,876 --> 00:04:37,621
Okay, well, they're not, uh,
quite ready for us yet,

145
00:04:37,709 --> 00:04:39,541
so Dr. Webber will take you
to see the ICU,

146
00:04:39,629 --> 00:04:41,315
and I will meet you guys there
in a few minutes.

147
00:04:41,402 --> 00:04:42,408
Okay.

148
00:04:42,502 --> 00:04:43,578
Uh, okay.

149
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:45,252
Uh, the ICU is this way.

150
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:46,949
<i>Oh, God! No, no, no!</i>

151
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:48,532
- Oh, but, uh, you know,
- <i>You got to clamp it first!</i>

152
00:04:48,619 --> 00:04:49,846
If we go in this direction,

153
00:04:49,934 --> 00:04:52,323
I can show you our new
MRI on the way.

154
00:04:52,619 --> 00:04:55,080
- Thanks.
- Thank you very much.

155
00:04:57,041 --> 00:04:58,204
Oh, my God.

156
00:04:58,292 --> 00:05:00,165
<i>Dr. Chatmon to Radiology.</i>

157
00:05:00,253 --> 00:05:01,362

158
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:03,565
Shepherd, uh,
you got a second?

159
00:05:03,653 --> 00:05:04,662
Bailey, are you okay?

160
00:05:04,749 --> 00:05:06,354
I... I'm sorry.

161
00:05:06,579 --> 00:05:09,901
Um... I'm... pregnant.

162
00:05:09,989 --> 00:05:12,526
And I hear you are, too.
Congratulations.

163
00:05:12,614 --> 00:05:14,187
Thanks. You, too?
That's...

164
00:05:14,275 --> 00:05:15,713
Are your ankles swollen?

165
00:05:15,801 --> 00:05:18,733
Do you have intense cravings
for root beer?

166
00:05:18,821 --> 00:05:22,188
Are you panicking about
how you finally have the career

167
00:05:22,276 --> 00:05:23,932
you've imagined
for yourself,

168
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:26,121
but will now be breastfeeding
for the next 12 months

169
00:05:26,209 --> 00:05:28,242
because the AAP
strongly recommends it?

170
00:05:28,329 --> 00:05:30,282
Yes to all, but my cravings
are for pepperoni,

171
00:05:30,369 --> 00:05:31,702
which, historically,
I hate.

172
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:34,539
This morning,
Tuck texted me a picture

173
00:05:34,627 --> 00:05:35,992
of him
in his Halloween costume,

174
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:37,344
and I burst into tears.

175
00:05:37,432 --> 00:05:39,032
That's the hormones.
That's normal.

176
00:05:39,119 --> 00:05:40,774
Okay, well,
I don't like it.

177
00:05:40,862 --> 00:05:43,627
I can't cry at work,
not in front of the staff

178
00:05:43,715 --> 00:05:45,945
and certainly not
in front of Tom Koracick.

179
00:05:46,033 --> 00:05:47,662
The last thing I need

180
00:05:47,749 --> 00:05:50,992
is for the self-proclaimed
chief of chiefs

181
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:52,952
to see me reduced
to a puddle of tears.

182
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:54,774
Isn't "chief of chiefs"
his actual title?

183
00:05:55,869 --> 00:05:57,362
Right.
Not the point. Okay.

184
00:05:57,450 --> 00:05:58,889
If you feel like
you're gonna cry,

185
00:05:58,977 --> 00:06:01,039
try pressing your tongue
to the roof of your mouth.

186
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:03,229
You can also try
looking up at the ceiling.

187
00:06:04,674 --> 00:06:06,104
Okay. I'll try it.

188
00:06:06,579 --> 00:06:08,409
You know,
all I wanted to do was vent,

189
00:06:08,496 --> 00:06:10,807
and you gave me
useful advice.

190
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:12,015
Thank you.

191
00:06:15,065 --> 00:06:16,094
What...

192
00:06:19,293 --> 00:06:21,072
<i>Dr. Sutton
to the Step-down Unit.</i>

193
00:06:21,159 --> 00:06:23,135
<i>Dr. Sutton
to the Step-down Unit.</i>

194
00:06:23,223 --> 00:06:24,705
- Hey.
- Hey.

195
00:06:24,793 --> 00:06:26,682
- Lunch today?
- Sure. Yeah.

196
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:28,071
My afternoon's clear.
Great.

197
00:06:28,159 --> 00:06:30,122
Uh, my parents' reservation's
for 12:30,

198
00:06:30,209 --> 00:06:31,776
so see you in the lobby
at noon?

199
00:06:31,864 --> 00:06:33,911
- This lunch is with your parents?
- Yeah.

200
00:06:34,157 --> 00:06:35,901
Remember when I did that
for you?

201
00:06:35,989 --> 00:06:37,322
I thought your parents
hated each other.

202
00:06:37,409 --> 00:06:39,867
They do, but it's
my cancer-versary.

203
00:06:39,955 --> 00:06:42,492
Oh. Uh, that's...
What is that?

204
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:44,275
That's the anniversary
of my doctor telling us

205
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:45,549
that my scans were clear.

206
00:06:45,637 --> 00:06:47,518
We go to lunch every year.
That's nice.

207
00:06:47,606 --> 00:06:50,059
It is...
For the first 15 minutes.

208
00:06:50,147 --> 00:06:52,133
Then it turns
into a competition

209
00:06:52,221 --> 00:06:54,282
to prove whose life is better
since the divorce.

210
00:06:54,369 --> 00:06:56,127
But this year
will be different, though.

211
00:06:56,288 --> 00:06:57,846
Because they will both
hate me?

212
00:06:57,934 --> 00:06:59,691
I am terrible with parents.

213
00:06:59,975 --> 00:07:02,112
Because we'll tell them
about the baby.

214
00:07:02,472 --> 00:07:03,836
Lobby at noon?

215
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:05,202
Yay!

216
00:07:05,289 --> 00:07:06,854
Right.
They are gonna love you.

217
00:07:07,957 --> 00:07:09,725
<i>Dr. Daimers...</i>

218
00:07:10,065 --> 00:07:12,026
Dr. Daimers...

219
00:07:12,114 --> 00:07:12,823
Really?

220
00:07:12,911 --> 00:07:14,894
They have to special-order
the UV coating that we need.

221
00:07:14,981 --> 00:07:16,321
We're kind of
at their mercy, Anne.

222
00:07:16,408 --> 00:07:18,080
That's ridiculous.
I-I-I know that.

223
00:07:18,168 --> 00:07:19,806
Whoa. It is dark in here. I know
that, but what else are we supposed to...

224
00:07:19,893 --> 00:07:21,908
Excuse us. I'm sorry.
Good morning.

225
00:07:21,996 --> 00:07:24,510
Dr. Schmitt's gonna go ahead
and get us started today.

226
00:07:24,796 --> 00:07:27,338
Mary Rose Hawkins-Garrett,
age 11,

227
00:07:27,449 --> 00:07:30,479
diagnosed at 6 months
with xeroderma pigmentosum,

228
00:07:30,567 --> 00:07:33,730
making her unable
to withstand UV light

229
00:07:33,818 --> 00:07:35,861
without risk of severe burns
or skin cancer,

230
00:07:35,992 --> 00:07:38,033
which is why we have
the curtains for protection.

231
00:07:38,141 --> 00:07:40,385
Okay. Mind if I go ahead
and take a look?

232
00:07:42,119 --> 00:07:43,617
Mary Rose was admitted

233
00:07:43,705 --> 00:07:44,993
for second-degree burns
on her arms,

234
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,202
due to apparent
UV exposure.

235
00:07:47,289 --> 00:07:48,412
We don't know
how it happened.

236
00:07:48,499 --> 00:07:50,344
I mean, she's never out
in the sun without...

237
00:07:50,432 --> 00:07:52,122
Mnh-mnh... protective
clothing and sunscreen.

238
00:07:52,209 --> 00:07:53,526
Where's Dr. Alex?

239
00:07:53,614 --> 00:07:54,614
You know what?

240
00:07:54,702 --> 00:07:56,102
Dr. Alex just started
a new job

241
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:57,346
at another hospital.

242
00:07:57,434 --> 00:07:59,635
Oh. He's been her doctor
since she was born.

243
00:07:59,723 --> 00:08:00,643
Did he quit because of

244
00:08:00,731 --> 00:08:02,705
the "hospital from hell"
article?

245
00:08:02,853 --> 00:08:04,573
- Something like that.
- Mhph.

246
00:08:04,713 --> 00:08:06,424
So, by the looks of it,

247
00:08:06,557 --> 00:08:09,744
this UV exposure's happened
in the last couple days,

248
00:08:09,832 --> 00:08:12,045
certainly long enough
for your arms to get infected.

249
00:08:12,133 --> 00:08:13,477
It's a large enough area

250
00:08:13,565 --> 00:08:14,853
that I think
we'll need to debride

251
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,135
in an operating room.

252
00:08:17,075 --> 00:08:18,488
She needs surgery?

253
00:08:18,576 --> 00:08:20,072
You really don't know
how this happened, huh?

254
00:08:20,159 --> 00:08:21,742
No. We're careful.

255
00:08:21,862 --> 00:08:23,901
- Dr. Karev knows.
- Okay.

256
00:08:23,989 --> 00:08:26,198
Will I be done in time
to trick-or-treat?

257
00:08:26,408 --> 00:08:29,299
Halloween's the one night
where all the kids are outside,

258
00:08:29,387 --> 00:08:31,662
and I can be with them without
my stupid protective helmet.

259
00:08:31,749 --> 00:08:33,158
Oh, even if Dr. Avery and I

260
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:35,143
work as fast as
we possibly can,

261
00:08:35,244 --> 00:08:36,532
y-you're probably still
gonna have to stay,

262
00:08:36,619 --> 00:08:38,362
uh, a night or...

263
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:39,877
You know what?

264
00:08:40,446 --> 00:08:43,449
The hospital does have
a pretty great Halloween party.

265
00:08:43,537 --> 00:08:46,235
I mean, it's got games
and trick-or-treating.

266
00:08:46,323 --> 00:08:48,026
And we've got a really cool
costume parade.

267
00:08:48,114 --> 00:08:50,688
And I'm pretty sure
there's no helmet required.

268
00:08:50,776 --> 00:08:51,906
- Is that right?
- Nope.

269
00:08:51,994 --> 00:08:53,047
Yeah.
So,

270
00:08:53,135 --> 00:08:54,688
uh, how's that sound?
Pretty good?

271
00:08:54,776 --> 00:08:56,073
Alright.

272
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:58,136
Well, Dr. DeLuca will go ahead
and get you started,

273
00:08:58,223 --> 00:08:59,943
- and I'll see you in a minute.
- Thank you.

274
00:09:00,721 --> 00:09:02,271
There's no party.

275
00:09:02,359 --> 00:09:04,522
Dr. Karev always assigned it
to a resident,

276
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:06,723
and he's not here anymore,
so...

277
00:09:06,811 --> 00:09:08,104
So you'll make sure
it happens.

278
00:09:08,328 --> 00:09:10,268
- Oh, I have plans.
- I know.

279
00:09:10,356 --> 00:09:11,736
I just gave them to you.

280
00:09:19,529 --> 00:09:21,258
Eddie,
why isn't anyone working?

281
00:09:21,346 --> 00:09:23,596
I told the investors
we were ahead of schedule.

282
00:09:26,612 --> 00:09:27,721
There.

283
00:09:27,949 --> 00:09:29,338
Yeah. What is it?

284
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:32,512
Well, I'm no doctor,
but I think that's a skull.

285
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:34,821
That's another one.

286
00:09:34,909 --> 00:09:37,952
And that's... a lot more.

287
00:09:42,817 --> 00:09:44,612
You want us
to keep working?

288
00:09:45,052 --> 00:09:46,282
Yeah, I'm... I'm gonna
need a minute.

289
00:09:50,713 --> 00:09:53,580

291
00:10:01,615 --> 00:10:03,674
They call these "fun size,"

292
00:10:03,967 --> 00:10:05,533
but they'd be more fun
if they were bigger.

293
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:08,072
Are you sure
you don't want one?

294
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:10,242
I prefer
not to lose my teeth.

295
00:10:16,379 --> 00:10:17,463
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

296
00:10:17,598 --> 00:10:18,743
Let's get you back
on that gurney.

297
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:20,050
No. My leg's just
a little scraped up.

298
00:10:20,137 --> 00:10:21,534
This is all fake.
It's my friend.

299
00:10:21,673 --> 00:10:24,219
Austin Goodrich, 18,
auto versus pedestrian.

300
00:10:24,307 --> 00:10:25,412
He's got visible
head trauma.

301
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:26,408
Left pupil's blown.

302
00:10:26,496 --> 00:10:29,031
Hypotensive and tachy
despite 500 cc of I.,

303
00:10:29,119 --> 00:10:30,412
likely due
to abdominal bleeding.

304
00:10:30,499 --> 00:10:32,151
Oh, you mean
where that giant ax is?

305
00:10:32,239 --> 00:10:34,297
That is not real,
but also difficult to remove.

306
00:10:34,385 --> 00:10:36,594
We were walking to school
when this car plowed into him.

307
00:10:36,682 --> 00:10:38,077
Driver said
he just didn't see him.

308
00:10:38,165 --> 00:10:39,737
Austin always wins
our costume contest.

309
00:10:39,825 --> 00:10:42,028
He's, like, a master of
fake blood and guts and organs.

310
00:10:42,353 --> 00:10:43,543
Is he gonna be okay?

311
00:10:43,631 --> 00:10:45,874
We'll know more when we take
a look at his real organs.

312
00:10:45,962 --> 00:10:47,360
Let's get him
into trauma one!

313
00:10:48,999 --> 00:10:50,931
- <i>Dr. Danforth to the ER.</i>
- And to help them, we...

314
00:10:51,018 --> 00:10:52,046
<i>Dr. Danforth to the ER.</i>

315
00:10:52,133 --> 00:10:53,954
Uh, w-would you excuse me?

316
00:10:54,042 --> 00:10:55,608
Uh, M-Michaela?
Over there.

317
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:57,122
Thank you.

318
00:10:57,209 --> 00:10:58,742
- Oh.
- Go.

319
00:10:58,829 --> 00:10:59,915
I need advice

320
00:11:00,003 --> 00:11:01,916
on breaking bad news
to the investors.

321
00:11:02,004 --> 00:11:03,079
Hmm.

322
00:11:03,167 --> 00:11:04,781
Well, I've always found
it's best

323
00:11:04,869 --> 00:11:06,122
to be up-front
and straightforward.

324
00:11:06,209 --> 00:11:07,656
Investors would rather
hear it from you

325
00:11:07,743 --> 00:11:08,483
than through
the grapevine.

326
00:11:08,571 --> 00:11:09,248
Why?
What's happening?

327
00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:10,452
C-Construction is stopped

328
00:11:10,539 --> 00:11:12,618
due to a... a...
A mass grave.

329
00:11:13,517 --> 00:11:14,625
A... A what, now?

330
00:11:14,713 --> 00:11:17,227
The new wing is apparently
on a... a burial ground

331
00:11:17,329 --> 00:11:18,764
from, uh, 100 years ago.

332
00:11:19,909 --> 00:11:21,113
You're pranking me
for Halloween, right?

333
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,063
This was once apparently
a mental hospital,

334
00:11:23,151 --> 00:11:25,157
and once people died
and nobody came for them and...

335
00:11:25,244 --> 00:11:26,915
Ugh. Yeah.

336
00:11:27,123 --> 00:11:29,977
Well, you definitely don't
want to tell the investors that.

337
00:11:30,179 --> 00:11:33,532
O-Okay, y-you handle it,
and... and I'll keep them busy.

338
00:11:33,713 --> 00:11:36,532
Sure explains why this place
feels haunted.

339
00:11:36,649 --> 00:11:38,032
It's not haunted.

340
00:11:42,871 --> 00:11:45,374
Help!
Ohh! Someone help me!

341
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:47,711
I'm bleeding so much!

342
00:11:47,868 --> 00:11:49,506
Ohh! Aah!

343
00:11:49,594 --> 00:11:50,875
Really?

344
00:11:51,264 --> 00:11:52,209
Seriously?

345
00:11:52,297 --> 00:11:53,952
Look how good
this makeup is.

346
00:11:54,039 --> 00:11:55,382
You weren't even
a little bit scared?

347
00:11:55,469 --> 00:11:56,322
I'm a corpse.

348
00:11:56,409 --> 00:11:58,367
Well, it's kind of a dime
a dozen around here today.

349
00:11:58,454 --> 00:12:00,179
There's a graveyard
under our construction site.

350
00:12:00,266 --> 00:12:01,452
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

351
00:12:01,539 --> 00:12:02,798
And I'm waiting
to hear back from County,

352
00:12:02,885 --> 00:12:04,161
and I don't have time
for this.

353
00:12:05,949 --> 00:12:06,993
It's Hunt.

354
00:12:07,081 --> 00:12:08,975
Multiple patients
crashing in the ICU.

355
00:12:09,063 --> 00:12:09,852
Let's go.

356
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:11,272
You know I don't work here,
right?

357
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,344
I don't have more room
for dead bodies today.

358
00:12:13,438 --> 00:12:14,805
Come on.

359
00:12:18,589 --> 00:12:20,281
Man, I don't want
to tear his skin,

360
00:12:20,369 --> 00:12:22,202
but this is really stuck.

361
00:12:22,268 --> 00:12:23,891
I think it's spirit gum.

362
00:12:23,956 --> 00:12:26,297
Um, I-I need
more alcohol wipes.

363
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:27,836
What's spirit gum?

364
00:12:27,924 --> 00:12:28,907
If you're old enough
to know what it is,

365
00:12:28,995 --> 00:12:30,158
you're too old
for trick-or-treating.

366
00:12:31,119 --> 00:12:33,545
You want to put an age limit
on Halloween?

367
00:12:33,633 --> 00:12:35,139
A town in Canada did... 16.

368
00:12:35,227 --> 00:12:37,280
After that, it's just
panhandling in a costume.

369
00:12:37,368 --> 00:12:38,663
Alright, he's bleeding
from his belly.

370
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:39,889
We need to get him
to an OR.

371
00:12:39,977 --> 00:12:41,094
Tom, how much longer?

372
00:12:41,182 --> 00:12:42,455
To retract the scalp
and the galea,

373
00:12:42,542 --> 00:12:44,411
create an osteotomy,
incise the dura,

374
00:12:44,499 --> 00:12:46,161
and decompress
the hematoma?

375
00:12:46,919 --> 00:12:48,123
I'm done.

376
00:12:51,829 --> 00:12:53,047
What happened?

377
00:12:53,198 --> 00:12:54,281
Ohh!

378
00:12:54,369 --> 00:12:56,621
See? That is the appropriate
reaction.

379
00:12:56,709 --> 00:12:57,952
Cecil Taylor, my wife, Jo.

380
00:12:58,039 --> 00:12:58,907
Two patients crashed,

381
00:12:58,995 --> 00:13:00,578
and now a bunch of have
cardiac arrhythmias.

382
00:13:00,665 --> 00:13:01,803
- How many?
- All of them.

383
00:13:01,891 --> 00:13:03,467
And no idea why.

384
00:13:03,555 --> 00:13:05,242
Your hospital's haunted.

385
00:13:09,592 --> 00:13:12,790
I'm saying not everyone
likes surprises.

386
00:13:12,878 --> 00:13:13,889
Sure.

387
00:13:13,977 --> 00:13:16,000
Just people who lack
a sense of adventure.

388
00:13:16,088 --> 00:13:18,161
- Oh, please.
- Oh!

389
00:13:18,369 --> 00:13:19,657
Hey, there he is.

390
00:13:19,745 --> 00:13:21,086
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

391
00:13:21,174 --> 00:13:22,467
- Hi.
- Hi.

392
00:13:22,555 --> 00:13:23,610
Eric.

393
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:25,407
- So glad to meet you.
- You, too.

394
00:13:25,495 --> 00:13:27,018
Yeah.

395
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:28,998
So, you must be Amelia.

396
00:13:29,086 --> 00:13:30,383
- Yes.
- I'm Maureen.

397
00:13:30,471 --> 00:13:33,634
- Hi.
- So glad that you could join us.

398
00:13:33,798 --> 00:13:35,859
Yeah. Me too.

399
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,344
- Ahh.
- Okay.

400
00:13:37,432 --> 00:13:38,947
Ahh.

401
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:43,702
I-I didn't even know
that Link was seeing anyone

402
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:45,477
until today.

403
00:13:45,789 --> 00:13:46,782
How long has it been?

404
00:13:46,869 --> 00:13:49,790
Um
a few months?

405
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:52,062
But we've known each other
longer than that, though.

406
00:13:52,149 --> 00:13:53,202
Right.

407
00:13:53,289 --> 00:13:55,743
Yeah.
Actually, my sister,

408
00:13:55,831 --> 00:13:58,030
uh, tried to set us up a year ago.

409
00:13:58,118 --> 00:14:00,625
Well, a lot can change
in a year.

410
00:14:00,713 --> 00:14:02,036
Yeah!

411
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:03,409
So much!

412
00:14:03,838 --> 00:14:06,282
A year ago, I was living with
my ex-husband and two kids.

413
00:14:07,619 --> 00:14:09,072
Uh, not our kids.

414
00:14:09,422 --> 00:14:12,032
Um, well, one is ours,
but, um, but mostly his.

415
00:14:12,119 --> 00:14:13,735
He's adopted... Leo.

416
00:14:13,823 --> 00:14:15,557
The other
is Leo's birth mom.

417
00:14:15,659 --> 00:14:17,057
She was not
with us very long,

418
00:14:17,145 --> 00:14:19,250
but, um, between her
running away and going to rehab,

419
00:14:19,338 --> 00:14:20,338
it was petty messy.

420
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:23,432
Plus, um, Link was kind of
asking out my other sister.

421
00:14:25,369 --> 00:14:28,963
Sometimes things
just work out better

422
00:14:29,104 --> 00:14:30,604
the second time around.

423
00:14:30,939 --> 00:14:33,447
Speaking of which...

424
00:14:33,814 --> 00:14:35,276
..I have some news.

425
00:14:35,364 --> 00:14:37,534
- Well, actually, um, so do...
- I...

426
00:14:38,189 --> 00:14:39,942
...am getting remarried.

427
00:14:42,752 --> 00:14:43,745
Oh, wow.

428
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:45,456
- Really?
- Yeah.

429
00:14:45,659 --> 00:14:46,877
Congratulations!

430
00:14:46,965 --> 00:14:48,963
Do we have to talk
about this now?

431
00:14:49,051 --> 00:14:50,792
Yeah, you know, it all
happened pretty quickly,

432
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:53,698
but I'm feeling
really good about it.

433
00:14:53,854 --> 00:14:57,242
And I know that
you are gonna love him.

434
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:58,789
Can't wait to meet him.

435
00:14:59,712 --> 00:15:01,682
You don't have to.

436
00:15:09,643 --> 00:15:10,901
Yeah.

437
00:15:11,135 --> 00:15:12,385
Surprise.

438
00:15:21,172 --> 00:15:23,666
She is lucky,
I mean, that's a hell of a burn,

439
00:15:23,754 --> 00:15:25,565
but not quite
past the dermis.

440
00:15:25,821 --> 00:15:27,432
How's Grey handling
lock-up?

441
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,401
Oh. I mean,
she's great with a scalpel,

442
00:15:29,489 --> 00:15:31,455
but I can't picture her
wielding a shiv.

443
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:34,844
No. No. I can, actually.
It's hard to say.

444
00:15:34,932 --> 00:15:35,862
I mean, she's had about

445
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:38,213
eight minutes
of phone time total,

446
00:15:38,301 --> 00:15:40,254
which she spent talking
to her kids, obviously.

447
00:15:40,342 --> 00:15:41,846
Right. So you're playing house
over there?

448
00:15:41,933 --> 00:15:43,256
I'm helping out
when I can.

449
00:15:43,344 --> 00:15:45,080
Yeah.
I'm not sure it's welcome.

450
00:15:45,206 --> 00:15:46,945
Zola looked like she wanted
to shiv me this morning.

451
00:15:47,033 --> 00:15:48,031
Really? Why?

452
00:15:48,119 --> 00:15:49,822
- What'd you do?
- No clue.

453
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:51,987
Yeah, well, welcome
to fatherhood, buddy.

454
00:15:52,075 --> 00:15:53,359
I'm not trying to be
anyone's father.

455
00:15:53,446 --> 00:15:55,622
No, you're just taking care
of your girlfriend's children

456
00:15:55,709 --> 00:15:57,151
while she's behind bars.

457
00:15:57,239 --> 00:15:58,071
Totally different.

458
00:15:58,177 --> 00:15:59,911
Okay. Gauze, please.

459
00:16:01,733 --> 00:16:03,284
With kids,
it's hard to tell,

460
00:16:03,377 --> 00:16:05,750
but it's almost always
for a reason.

461
00:16:05,869 --> 00:16:07,662
You just got
to figure it out.

462
00:16:12,662 --> 00:16:14,807
We checked to make sure

463
00:16:14,909 --> 00:16:16,952
- his lip lac isn't real, right?
- Yeah.

464
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:17,992
When did everyone start

465
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:20,034
spending so much time
on costumes?

466
00:16:20,209 --> 00:16:21,838
What's Allison gonna be?

467
00:16:22,284 --> 00:16:23,432
A baby.

468
00:16:23,573 --> 00:16:24,635
Right.

469
00:16:24,877 --> 00:16:25,952
Lap pads.

470
00:16:26,039 --> 00:16:27,362
You know that Owen's mom

471
00:16:27,449 --> 00:16:29,336
made all of his
and Megan's costumes

472
00:16:29,424 --> 00:16:30,492
when they were little?

473
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:32,452
Like, put sheets
over their heads

474
00:16:32,539 --> 00:16:34,385
- and called them ghosts?
- No.

475
00:16:34,501 --> 00:16:37,702
Sewed and glue-gunned
and embroidered.

476
00:16:38,026 --> 00:16:39,862
She was
an amazing Army nurse

477
00:16:39,949 --> 00:16:42,393
and a mom who made other moms
feel inept.

478
00:16:42,481 --> 00:16:45,479
I don't think anyone
equates good costumes

479
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,573
with good parenting.

480
00:16:46,661 --> 00:16:48,144
Well, Owen might.
I have no idea.

481
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:51,578
We went from best friends
to family of four

482
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:53,344
almost overnight.
There were many steps

483
00:16:53,432 --> 00:16:54,751
that were skipped,
I mean, steps tha

484
00:16:54,838 --> 00:16:55,909
would have prepared me

485
00:16:55,997 --> 00:16:58,002
for what we're doing right now,
which is...

486
00:16:58,764 --> 00:17:00,071
I have no idea
what it is.

487
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:02,065
Me neither.

488
00:17:02,368 --> 00:17:03,437
Tom, you were...

489
00:17:03,525 --> 00:17:05,721
You were so quiet
that I forgot that...

490
00:17:06,363 --> 00:17:08,065
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

491
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:09,541
And you are not "inept,"

492
00:17:09,629 --> 00:17:11,893
except maybe in your choice
of baby daddies.

493
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:14,330
And don't let ginger beer
or his mom

494
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:15,815
make you feel
any other way.

495
00:17:15,903 --> 00:17:17,574
I'm sorry. I-I shouldn't
have brought it up.

496
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:20,448
It's just that... that those
costumes were so terrifying...

497
00:17:20,604 --> 00:17:22,072
And... and... and not
in a Halloween way.

498
00:17:22,159 --> 00:17:24,143
Halloween's a phony holiday,
anyway.

499
00:17:24,231 --> 00:17:25,323
Dangerous, too.

500
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:26,665
Kids are twice as likely
to be hit by

501
00:17:26,752 --> 00:17:28,807
a car and die
on Halloween as any other day.

502
00:17:28,895 --> 00:17:31,516
This kid's lucky we were here to
keep him alive... or at least I was.

503
00:17:31,603 --> 00:17:34,266
The ventriculostomy
is draining perfectly.

504
00:17:34,354 --> 00:17:35,534
I will be in the ER

505
00:17:35,622 --> 00:17:38,002
with the other
Halloween casualties.

506
00:17:39,421 --> 00:17:41,032
How did you date that man?

507
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:43,026
Well,
he has his moments.

508
00:17:43,197 --> 00:17:45,041
Oh, no.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

509
00:17:45,129 --> 00:17:46,995
No, he really does have
some good qualities.

510
00:17:47,096 --> 00:17:48,125
No.

511
00:17:48,213 --> 00:17:49,946
Pancreatic head
looks severed.

512
00:17:50,034 --> 00:17:51,662
Probably blunt-force trauma

513
00:17:51,749 --> 00:17:53,901
from him falling
onto the plastic ax.

514
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:57,032
It basically
caused half a Whipple.

515
00:17:57,119 --> 00:17:58,306
Alright. What do we do?

516
00:18:00,163 --> 00:18:01,448
Well,
we don't have a choice.

517
00:18:01,536 --> 00:18:02,701
We have to finish
a Whipple.

518
00:18:11,588 --> 00:18:12,622
You staring
at that clock's

519
00:18:12,709 --> 00:18:14,122
not gonna make it go
any faster.

520
00:18:14,307 --> 00:18:16,354
There isn't really
much else to do here.

521
00:18:16,463 --> 00:18:17,901
You could help me
with this puzzle,

522
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:19,713
stop wearing out
that floor.

523
00:18:20,384 --> 00:18:21,658
Hey, hey!

524
00:18:21,862 --> 00:18:22,946
Hi.

525
00:18:23,034 --> 00:18:24,344
Um, I'm Meredith Grey.

526
00:18:24,432 --> 00:18:27,534
I'm supposed to get out now,
actually.

527
00:18:29,624 --> 00:18:30,823
Paperwork's not here.

528
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:32,297
Where is it?

529
00:18:32,385 --> 00:18:33,862
Hasn't arrived from court.

530
00:18:34,503 --> 00:18:35,836
Should I call my lawyer?

531
00:18:35,924 --> 00:18:37,324
It'll show up.
Happens all the time.

532
00:18:37,573 --> 00:18:38,955
Okay.
But, wait. Hold on.

533
00:18:39,043 --> 00:18:40,326
It's...
You know, it's Halloween,

534
00:18:40,449 --> 00:18:41,860
and I have three kids
at home,

535
00:18:41,948 --> 00:18:43,032
and they shouldn't
have to suffer

536
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:44,122
for the court's mistake.

537
00:18:44,209 --> 00:18:45,322
I have to get a costume.

538
00:18:45,409 --> 00:18:47,041
You could go as "sad mom."

539
00:18:48,414 --> 00:18:49,830
Is anyone
in your family sick?

540
00:18:49,949 --> 00:18:51,737
I'm a doctor.
I could help.

541
00:18:51,825 --> 00:18:53,359
I like it better
on this side of the bars.

542
00:18:56,494 --> 00:18:57,794
You're a doctor?

543
00:18:57,998 --> 00:18:59,987
- Yeah. You need help?
- No.

544
00:19:00,075 --> 00:19:01,673
I'm just wondering
how the hell you let yourself

545
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,912
get locked in here.

546
00:19:06,762 --> 00:19:09,120
Dead bodies like corpses
or murder victims?

547
00:19:09,221 --> 00:19:11,474
No one was murdered.
Get back to work.

548
00:19:11,749 --> 00:19:13,032
You figure out what happened?
Not yet.

549
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:14,242
It's kind of
a war zone here.

550
00:19:14,401 --> 00:19:15,846
Your hospital's creepy.

551
00:19:15,934 --> 00:19:17,465
- You're not helping that situation.
- Okay.

552
00:19:17,552 --> 00:19:19,161
Those are the patients
who are okay.

553
00:19:19,249 --> 00:19:20,720
Those are the ones
who had arrhythmias.

554
00:19:20,807 --> 00:19:23,072
These had jaundice.
Those had fevers.

555
00:19:23,675 --> 00:19:24,877
Huh.

556
00:19:25,127 --> 00:19:26,665
- What?
- You see something?

557
00:19:26,752 --> 00:19:27,952
The pink.

558
00:19:28,689 --> 00:19:29,906
Transfusion forms.

559
00:19:29,994 --> 00:19:30,952
All these patients
got blood.

560
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,282
We've gotta call
Central Blood Supply,

561
00:19:32,369 --> 00:19:33,276
see if there's
anything's wrong...

562
00:19:33,364 --> 00:19:35,104
Actually, we have
our own blood supply.

563
00:19:35,192 --> 00:19:36,875
It's in the floor's
medical fridge.

564
00:19:36,963 --> 00:19:38,446
Okay. Where's that?
We need to see it.

565
00:19:39,653 --> 00:19:40,913
- Damn it. It's another V-fib.
- I'll get it.

566
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,385
You guys
check on the blood.

567
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:49,362
Uh, Link said you live
in different cities,

568
00:19:49,449 --> 00:19:50,737
so how did you two,
um...

569
00:19:50,825 --> 00:19:54,151
I moved to Denver for my job
earlier this year.

570
00:19:54,427 --> 00:19:56,170
I didn't know anybody there,

571
00:19:56,258 --> 00:19:58,922
so, uh, I signed up for
one of those dating apps.

572
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:01,662
First person they matched me
with was Maureen.

573
00:20:01,749 --> 00:20:04,024
I swiped left.
Been there, done that.

574
00:20:04,112 --> 00:20:05,162
I switched apps.

575
00:20:05,249 --> 00:20:07,432
I figured that one's algorithm
was bad.

576
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:09,787
But the next one
matched us, too.

577
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,383
And then when we matched
a third time,

578
00:20:12,471 --> 00:20:14,651
I texted him to laugh
about these dumb apps,

579
00:20:14,739 --> 00:20:16,799
and he suggested
that we have coffee.

580
00:20:16,887 --> 00:20:20,354
And, uh, turns out the apps
weren't so dumb.

581
00:20:22,662 --> 00:20:24,073
We've already
had a big wedding,

582
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,285
so this one's gonna be
low-key.

583
00:20:27,221 --> 00:20:31,051
But I would love for you
to be my best man.

584
00:20:33,222 --> 00:20:34,516
Ooh.

585
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:43,176
You two, uh...

586
00:20:44,644 --> 00:20:48,197
put me through hell
with your divorce.

587
00:20:48,285 --> 00:20:49,674
You used me like a pawn.

588
00:20:49,762 --> 00:20:50,933
You... You made me
a go-between.

589
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:52,442
You forced me
to pick sides.

590
00:20:52,572 --> 00:20:54,887
I spent Christmas days
on an airplane

591
00:20:54,975 --> 00:20:56,770
so I could have
breakfast with you

592
00:20:56,973 --> 00:20:58,504
and dinner with you.

593
00:20:58,753 --> 00:21:01,042
I double-majored in college

594
00:21:01,901 --> 00:21:05,283
So you could go to separate
graduation ceremonies.

595
00:21:05,379 --> 00:21:08,885
It took me years to learn
how to manage parents

596
00:21:08,973 --> 00:21:09,910
who could barely
sit through a lunch

597
00:21:09,998 --> 00:21:11,416
without tearing
each other apart,

598
00:21:11,504 --> 00:21:12,952
and now... now...

599
00:21:13,406 --> 00:21:16,510
now you're...
You're getting back together?

600
00:21:17,154 --> 00:21:20,012
I don't... I don't even know
what to say.

601
00:21:20,426 --> 00:21:22,424
I think they just want you
to say you're happy...

602
00:21:22,512 --> 00:21:24,162
No, no, no, they... they don't
get to tell me what to say.

603
00:21:24,249 --> 00:21:25,896
They gave up that right
when they sat me down

604
00:21:25,983 --> 00:21:27,893
and told me our family
was a "painful lie,"

605
00:21:27,981 --> 00:21:29,492
which, together or not,

606
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:31,499
we are never gonna do
to our kid.

607
00:21:32,539 --> 00:21:33,782
Oh, yeah.

608
00:21:33,869 --> 00:21:35,340
You're gonna be
grandparents.

609
00:21:36,897 --> 00:21:39,199
You know what?
I need some air.

610
00:21:42,219 --> 00:21:43,765
Surprise!

611
00:21:44,318 --> 00:21:45,351
Huh.

612
00:21:52,511 --> 00:21:55,715
Okay. Temperature gauge
seems to be working.

613
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:57,535
Yeah. Feels cool.

614
00:21:58,091 --> 00:22:00,067
Wait.
It's zero degrees Celsius.

615
00:22:00,155 --> 00:22:01,629
It's supposed to be
between 1 and 6.

616
00:22:01,787 --> 00:22:02,817
It's gone bad.

617
00:22:02,905 --> 00:22:04,016
The blood hemolyzed.

618
00:22:04,104 --> 00:22:05,573
We basically pumped them
with straight potassium.

619
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:06,371
A few more minutes,

620
00:22:06,459 --> 00:22:08,069
and the ICU would be
nothing but corpses.

621
00:22:08,157 --> 00:22:09,781
And I've already got a backyard
full of those.

622
00:22:09,868 --> 00:22:11,332
Okay, we're gonna
need labs for anyone

623
00:22:11,419 --> 00:22:13,539
who's been given blood from this
fridge in the past 24 hours.

624
00:22:13,626 --> 00:22:15,880
From now on, every department
uses Central Blood Supply.

625
00:22:15,968 --> 00:22:17,412
That's why it's there.

626
00:22:19,491 --> 00:22:23,194
Anastomosis looks
patent and intact.

627
00:22:23,476 --> 00:22:26,215
I mean, this has got to be
a parent's worse nightmare.

628
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:27,952
Do you worry about Tuck
trick-or-treating?

629
00:22:28,039 --> 00:22:29,992
My son and his girlfriend

630
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:32,322
are going to horror night
in the park.

631
00:22:32,409 --> 00:22:33,662
They're both zombies

632
00:22:33,749 --> 00:22:36,788
because they wanted to do
a couple's costume.

633
00:22:36,909 --> 00:22:39,340
I have... ugh...

634
00:22:39,428 --> 00:22:40,992
Other things
to worry about.

635
00:22:47,817 --> 00:22:49,321
I need, uh, drains

636
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:50,572
and 3-0 nylon.

637
00:22:50,659 --> 00:22:52,132
You know what?

638
00:22:52,539 --> 00:22:53,952
Don't worry
about the costume.

639
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:57,217
There's never enough time
to do everything you want,

640
00:22:57,453 --> 00:22:59,139
so spend it
with your babies.

641
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:02,568
That's more important
than any perfect costume.

642
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:06,139
Alright.

643
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,967
It's not
the prettiest gastro-J.

644
00:23:08,076 --> 00:23:09,607
But it got the job done.

645
00:23:12,829 --> 00:23:15,862
So, I was picking up trash

646
00:23:15,949 --> 00:23:17,561
for my community service.

647
00:23:17,712 --> 00:23:20,301
And I'm waiting
for the medical commission

648
00:23:20,389 --> 00:23:22,920
to decide whether or not
to take my license,

649
00:23:23,008 --> 00:23:24,037
which I can't lose,

650
00:23:24,125 --> 00:23:27,053
because I have three kids
and I love being a surgeon.

651
00:23:27,289 --> 00:23:30,659
I would miss the OR
and miss my patients.

652
00:23:32,649 --> 00:23:34,146
Do you have kids?

653
00:23:34,725 --> 00:23:35,982
Two.

654
00:23:36,323 --> 00:23:38,975
And two jobs
to make ends meet.

655
00:23:41,725 --> 00:23:43,912
One night, my childcare
fell through.

656
00:23:43,999 --> 00:23:45,452
I couldn't find
a babysitter

657
00:23:45,539 --> 00:23:47,912
or a sub for the graveyard shift
at the mini-mart,

658
00:23:47,999 --> 00:23:51,123
so I put my two kids to bed,
and I went to work.

659
00:23:51,659 --> 00:23:53,654
I was less than
a block away.

660
00:23:54,287 --> 00:23:56,951
I ran back and checked on them
every break I had.

661
00:23:57,358 --> 00:23:59,238
But my 8-year-old woke up
and called 911

662
00:23:59,326 --> 00:24:00,879
when he saw
I wasn't home.

663
00:24:00,967 --> 00:24:02,076
Oh, no.

664
00:24:02,186 --> 00:24:03,538
I tried explaining it
to the police,

665
00:24:03,625 --> 00:24:05,662
but they were
in no mood to listen.

666
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:09,682
One of them came towards me.

667
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:13,881
I guess I waved him off,
out of instinct.

668
00:24:14,214 --> 00:24:18,068
My hand hit his face...
Not hard or anything.

669
00:24:19,498 --> 00:24:21,031
But they arrested me,

670
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:23,021
said I assaulted
a police officer.

671
00:24:23,188 --> 00:24:24,981
And a jury found you guilty
of that?

672
00:24:25,107 --> 00:24:26,787
I haven't had
a hearing yet.

673
00:24:27,775 --> 00:24:30,850
I can't afford bail,
so I'm stuck here.

674
00:24:31,013 --> 00:24:32,876
And my kids
are in foster care.

675
00:24:33,264 --> 00:24:34,412
Public defender says

676
00:24:34,499 --> 00:24:35,912
it's gonna be
probably another month.

677
00:24:35,999 --> 00:24:37,600
So...

678
00:24:39,732 --> 00:24:41,037
you can keep whining

679
00:24:41,133 --> 00:24:43,178
about how you might lose
your medical license,

680
00:24:43,266 --> 00:24:46,951
but I'm gonna stop listening
and focus on this puzzle.

681
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:07,125
I don't know why I'm so mad.

682
00:25:07,329 --> 00:25:08,412
When I was a kid,

683
00:25:08,521 --> 00:25:10,764
all I wanted was for them
to get back together.

684
00:25:11,061 --> 00:25:12,779
I even tried
to "Parent Trap" them.

685
00:25:13,162 --> 00:25:14,662
Seriously?

686
00:25:14,822 --> 00:25:15,906
I separately talked them
into taking me

687
00:25:15,993 --> 00:25:18,842
to the same showing
of "Sleepless in Seattle."

688
00:25:19,181 --> 00:25:22,115
But my dad hated rom-come,
and my mom hated my dad,

689
00:25:22,203 --> 00:25:24,243
so it didn't work out
very well.

690
00:25:27,253 --> 00:25:29,916
I don't think you're angry
about them getting remarried.

691
00:25:30,088 --> 00:25:32,926
Uh, I'm pretty sure that
they're the root of this anger.

692
00:25:34,249 --> 00:25:37,201
This day is supposed to be
about you.

693
00:25:38,286 --> 00:25:39,537
You are their kid.

694
00:25:39,662 --> 00:25:42,115
You survived cancer.

695
00:25:42,571 --> 00:25:44,354
And they are making
your cancer-versary

696
00:25:44,449 --> 00:25:46,896
all about them... again.

697
00:25:46,984 --> 00:25:48,007
Yeah.

698
00:25:48,095 --> 00:25:49,655
For somebody who says
they're terrible with parents,

699
00:25:49,742 --> 00:25:51,469
you seem to understand mine
pretty well.

700
00:25:52,518 --> 00:25:56,237
Well, I understand
family dysfunction.

701
00:25:59,753 --> 00:26:02,214
If you want to just leave,
we can.

702
00:26:05,225 --> 00:26:09,042
Or you can give them
a chance to do better.

703
00:26:12,569 --> 00:26:14,359
<i>Dr. Curt Sullivan to...</i>

704
00:26:14,446 --> 00:26:15,609
<i>Dr. Curt Sullivan to...</i>

705
00:26:15,829 --> 00:26:17,237
Ah. Oh, geez.

706
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:18,858
Ohh.

707
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:27,854
Are you a doctor?

708
00:26:29,369 --> 00:26:31,206
Yeah. I'm Dr. Schmitt.

709
00:26:31,358 --> 00:26:32,698
Do you need help?

710
00:26:33,709 --> 00:26:34,742
What's wrong?

711
00:26:34,829 --> 00:26:36,662
I can't find
a Halloween costume.

712
00:26:36,749 --> 00:26:38,253
Can you help me?

713
00:26:39,122 --> 00:26:42,409
Uh... sure.

714
00:26:42,603 --> 00:26:44,729
Come on.
Let's... Let's go look.

715
00:26:49,488 --> 00:26:50,781
<i>Yes, I believe so.</i>

716
00:26:50,869 --> 00:26:52,614
Ah! Just the person
I was looking for.

717
00:26:52,702 --> 00:26:53,950
Can it wait?
I got to do a post-op check.

718
00:26:54,037 --> 00:26:55,302
Oh,
I was talking to DeLuca,

719
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:57,404
but thank you for letting me
know that you're busy.

720
00:26:57,684 --> 00:26:59,853
Ah. Meet me in Mary Rose's room
when you're done.

721
00:26:59,949 --> 00:27:02,474
- Mm-hmm.
- What's up?

722
00:27:02,562 --> 00:27:04,038
So, I just picked up the kids
from school.

723
00:27:04,125 --> 00:27:07,021
Bailey and Ellis are in daycare,
but Zola is refusing.

724
00:27:07,119 --> 00:27:09,404
Because
it's for little kids.

725
00:27:09,492 --> 00:27:11,600
I would take her, but I have
surgery, and Amelia's out.

726
00:27:11,687 --> 00:27:13,641
- This isn't really a good time.
- She's super easy.

727
00:27:13,728 --> 00:27:15,564
She'll probably just read her
book or go to the OR gallery.

728
00:27:15,651 --> 00:27:18,088
- I-I'm rounding, Maggie...
- When's Mom coming back?

729
00:27:20,579 --> 00:27:22,250
Okay. She can, uh...

730
00:27:22,338 --> 00:27:23,362
She can come with me.

731
00:27:23,449 --> 00:27:24,862
- I'll figure something out.
- Great.

732
00:27:24,949 --> 00:27:26,853
So, you're gonna hang out
with Dr. DeLuca,

733
00:27:26,941 --> 00:27:28,844
and I'm gonna come
and get you later, okay?

734
00:27:28,932 --> 00:27:30,143
Mwah.

735
00:27:30,572 --> 00:27:32,039
Bye.

736
00:27:34,328 --> 00:27:35,713
Hey.

737
00:27:43,772 --> 00:27:47,135
<i>Dr. Hurdle, pick up Line 2.
Dr. Hurdle, Line 2.</i>

738
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:51,413
Am I okay?

739
00:27:51,749 --> 00:27:53,158
Did I miss Halloween?

740
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:54,861
Your arms are fine.

741
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:56,501
You're fine,
and you didn't miss anything.

742
00:27:56,588 --> 00:27:58,009
Trick-or-treating
didn't even start yet.

743
00:27:58,096 --> 00:27:59,924
Your parents are down
in the cafeteria,

744
00:28:00,012 --> 00:28:02,580
in case there's anything
you'd like to tell me

745
00:28:02,668 --> 00:28:04,140
about what
really happened.

746
00:28:04,228 --> 00:28:05,492
I don't know.

747
00:28:05,791 --> 00:28:07,662
Mary Rose.

748
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,525
I want Dr. Alex.

749
00:28:11,017 --> 00:28:12,484
Okay, fine.

750
00:28:12,572 --> 00:28:13,869
Lemme get him.

751
00:28:19,079 --> 00:28:20,572
Dude, come on.

752
00:28:20,659 --> 00:28:21,932
Tell me what happened.

753
00:28:22,545 --> 00:28:24,538
Mary Rose, come on.
I'm here to help, you know?

754
00:28:24,626 --> 00:28:26,206
Just tell me
what happened.

755
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:33,736
I begged my moms for a cat,

756
00:28:33,858 --> 00:28:36,799
so they finally got me one...
Miss Velma.

757
00:28:39,126 --> 00:28:42,299
But she ran out
a few days ago.

758
00:28:43,222 --> 00:28:45,305
I was scared
she'd get hit by a car.

759
00:28:45,393 --> 00:28:47,393
So you ran after her,
didn't you?

760
00:28:47,639 --> 00:28:49,228
I put on my helmet.

761
00:28:49,768 --> 00:28:52,088
But I didn't have time
for my jacket.

762
00:28:52,798 --> 00:28:54,400
Please don't tell my moms.

763
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:56,063
They'll make me
get rid of Miss Velma.

764
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:58,617
- These burns are very serious...
- And they hurt.

765
00:28:58,705 --> 00:28:59,961
I swear
I'm never going out

766
00:29:00,056 --> 00:29:01,861
without my protective gear
again.

767
00:29:01,977 --> 00:29:03,571
This sucks.

768
00:29:03,705 --> 00:29:04,826
I'll file this under

769
00:29:04,914 --> 00:29:06,900
doctor-patient privilege
this time.

770
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:09,461
This is your one pass,
okay?

771
00:29:15,608 --> 00:29:17,451
See?
There's always a reason.

772
00:29:17,539 --> 00:29:19,492
It's just a matter
of figuring out a way

773
00:29:19,579 --> 00:29:20,932
to get it out of them.

774
00:29:25,565 --> 00:29:27,688
Superman?
It's got a cool cape.

775
00:29:28,407 --> 00:29:29,658
Batman, then?

776
00:29:31,369 --> 00:29:33,697
Okay, uh, uh,
Captain America?

777
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,002
Spidey?

778
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:36,955
No superheroes.

779
00:29:37,196 --> 00:29:38,461
Okay.

780
00:29:38,579 --> 00:29:40,032
Uh, pbht.

781
00:29:40,119 --> 00:29:42,580
Ooh! How about a robot?

782
00:29:45,209 --> 00:29:48,861
Okay, you don't want to be
a monster, an athlete,

783
00:29:48,985 --> 00:29:52,533
a vampire, a racecar driver,
a Pokémon,

784
00:29:52,621 --> 00:29:53,829
a superhero, or a robot.

785
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:56,103
I don't know
what else there is.

786
00:29:57,244 --> 00:29:59,517
I want to be
a sunflower.

787
00:30:04,274 --> 00:30:05,604
Okay.

788
00:30:08,209 --> 00:30:10,181
So...

789
00:30:11,674 --> 00:30:14,587
maybe two weddings
next year?

790
00:30:14,689 --> 00:30:17,790
Uh, we're just focused
on the baby.

791
00:30:17,948 --> 00:30:19,682
Who we're gonna raise together,
of course.

792
00:30:19,774 --> 00:30:21,397
You're gonna
make a great dad.

793
00:30:21,485 --> 00:30:23,805
Well we obviously have
a lot to figure out

794
00:30:23,893 --> 00:30:26,088
before the baby arrives
in the spring.

795
00:30:26,998 --> 00:30:29,571
Exactly
when are you due?

796
00:30:29,659 --> 00:30:32,987
Oh, we put a deposit
on a wedding venue.

797
00:30:33,354 --> 00:30:34,767
Uh, third weekend in April.

798
00:30:38,244 --> 00:30:39,329
But we're flexible.

799
00:30:39,417 --> 00:30:41,494
We'll forfeit. Yeah.

800
00:30:43,369 --> 00:30:44,822
How old are your kids?

801
00:30:44,909 --> 00:30:46,024
6 and 8.

802
00:30:46,112 --> 00:30:47,385
Those are good ages...

803
00:30:47,541 --> 00:30:48,662
Old enough to help

804
00:30:48,749 --> 00:30:50,698
and still young enough
to want to.

805
00:30:51,198 --> 00:30:52,362
I just hope they're okay.

806
00:30:52,449 --> 00:30:53,649
Yeah. I mean,

807
00:30:53,737 --> 00:30:55,393
how are you not
climbing the walls?

808
00:30:55,487 --> 00:30:56,822
There's nothing else
to do in here

809
00:30:56,909 --> 00:30:58,492
but think about how screwed up
everything is.

810
00:30:58,579 --> 00:31:00,362
It's... infuriating.

811
00:31:00,705 --> 00:31:02,526
Oh, I was angry.

812
00:31:02,614 --> 00:31:03,791
First few days
I was in here,

813
00:31:03,879 --> 00:31:06,994
I almost put a hole
in that wall with my fist.

814
00:31:07,449 --> 00:31:10,362
Then I figured
I can go insane with rage

815
00:31:10,449 --> 00:31:12,791
or I can find
other things to do.

816
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,352
So I started reading
all of Toni Morrison's books.

817
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,149
I have an ongoing game
of gin rummy

818
00:31:17,237 --> 00:31:18,713
with Luiza from D Block.

819
00:31:18,936 --> 00:31:20,556
And I have this puzzle.

820
00:31:22,635 --> 00:31:24,048
Grey,
your paperwork's here.

821
00:31:26,078 --> 00:31:27,488
What are you waiting for?

822
00:31:29,159 --> 00:31:30,572
Sorry I'm not gonna
help you finish.

823
00:31:30,659 --> 00:31:32,159
We finished the edges.

824
00:31:32,592 --> 00:31:34,321
You just got to work with
what you got.

825
00:31:34,416 --> 00:31:35,596
<i>♪ When I look back ♪</i>

826
00:31:35,684 --> 00:31:37,412

- <i>♪ I remember ♪</i>
- There's some candy.

840
00:32:03,629 --> 00:32:04,869
I'll wait for my mom.

00:32:04,957 --> 00:32:07,119
<i>♪ I tried to keep it small,

842
00:32:07,207 --> 00:32:08,815

<i>♪ It's nobody's fault,

844
00:32:12,448 --> 00:32:14,971
Look, I'd really
like for us to get along.

845
00:32:15,059 --> 00:32:17,424
So, did I do something
to upset you this morning

846
00:32:17,512 --> 00:32:19,323
when I was helping you
with your costume?

847
00:32:19,701 --> 00:32:23,784
My dad fixed my wings...
before he died.

848
00:32:24,234 --> 00:32:25,527
Oh.

849
00:32:25,615 --> 00:32:28,108
They ripped,
and he sewed them up.

850
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:30,156
So you don't like it
when other people touch them?

851
00:32:32,079 --> 00:32:33,846
I don't want
to forget him.

852
00:32:34,064 --> 00:32:36,313
Oh, Zola.

853
00:32:36,517 --> 00:32:38,534
You're not gonna
forget your dad.

854
00:32:38,845 --> 00:32:40,073
No one's forgetting
your dad.

855
00:32:40,209 --> 00:32:41,867
I mean, he was a legend.

856
00:32:41,955 --> 00:32:43,432
Did you know him?

857
00:32:43,749 --> 00:32:45,202
No, I didn't know him.

858
00:32:45,289 --> 00:32:46,782
But a lot of people
here did.

859
00:32:46,885 --> 00:32:48,385
And they talk about him
all the time.

860
00:32:48,473 --> 00:32:49,766
I've heard the stories
so often,

861
00:32:49,854 --> 00:32:51,705
sometimes I forget
I wasn't even there.

862
00:32:52,115 --> 00:32:53,820
<i>♪ I got no regrets ♪</i>

863
00:32:53,908 --> 00:32:55,451
<i>♪ Don't know what comes next ♪</i>

864
00:32:56,078 --> 00:32:59,260
<i>♪ I wish you the best ♪</i>

865
00:33:00,176 --> 00:33:01,604
You know, one time,

866
00:33:01,692 --> 00:33:04,105
there was this lab tech
named Isaac,

867
00:33:04,204 --> 00:33:07,440
and he had this huge tumor
in his spine.

868
00:33:07,568 --> 00:33:09,201
And he'd taken it
to all these doctors,

869
00:33:09,289 --> 00:33:10,912
and they were all
too afraid to operate,

870
00:33:10,999 --> 00:33:12,362
but not your dad.

871
00:33:12,449 --> 00:33:13,916
Your dad said he would try.

872
00:33:14,206 --> 00:33:16,026
And when he opened Isaac up,

873
00:33:16,122 --> 00:33:17,735
he saw that the tumor
was even bigger

874
00:33:17,823 --> 00:33:19,143
than it was
on the scans.

875
00:33:19,248 --> 00:33:20,911
All he could do
was stare at it

876
00:33:21,087 --> 00:33:22,531
for 10 hours straight.

877
00:33:22,619 --> 00:33:23,696
Did he take it out?

878
00:33:23,784 --> 00:33:24,885
Not that day.

879
00:33:24,985 --> 00:33:27,188
He stayed up all night
thinking about it.

880
00:33:27,284 --> 00:33:29,992
And the next day, he opened up
Isaac again. He cut out as

881
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,417
- <i>♪ I wish you the best ♪</i>
- much of the tumor as he possibly could...

882
00:33:32,504 --> 00:33:33,859
..until all...

883
00:33:35,553 --> 00:33:37,744
A burial ground
explains a lot...

884
00:33:37,832 --> 00:33:38,972
Patients crashing,

885
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:41,321
the stairwell light
that flickers at midnight,

886
00:33:41,409 --> 00:33:43,492
the corpse bride
who haunts the room

887
00:33:43,579 --> 00:33:44,952
where her husband died.

888
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:46,574
Do you have
any more gauze?

889
00:33:46,662 --> 00:33:49,441
Oh, my God!
Haunted!

890
00:33:49,821 --> 00:33:51,904
Look,
nothing is haunted.

891
00:33:52,058 --> 00:33:53,465
The corpse bride is my...

892
00:33:53,553 --> 00:33:55,506
My wife
in a Halloween costume.

893
00:33:55,709 --> 00:33:56,952
Okay?
The patients crashed

894
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,533
because the refrigerator's
broken.

895
00:33:58,621 --> 00:34:00,345
And, yes,
there's a burial ground

896
00:34:00,433 --> 00:34:01,683
where the new wing
is going,

897
00:34:01,772 --> 00:34:03,480
but we've notified
the authorities,

898
00:34:03,568 --> 00:34:04,918
and we're exhuming
the bodies.

899
00:34:05,006 --> 00:34:06,886
- Everything is getting back on track.
- Mm-hmm.

900
00:34:06,998 --> 00:34:08,241
So stop spreading rumors.

901
00:34:08,329 --> 00:34:09,742
Get back to work!

902
00:34:13,524 --> 00:34:15,763
Did you say
"burial ground"?

903
00:34:16,062 --> 00:34:17,062
Uh...

904
00:34:19,948 --> 00:34:21,872
Almost had 'em.

905
00:34:32,067 --> 00:34:33,862
Keep fighting
the good fight, Dr. Grey.

906
00:34:33,949 --> 00:34:35,072
Yeah. Thanks.

907
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:36,800
But not so hard that
you end up back here.

908
00:34:38,848 --> 00:34:42,177
Um, I don't want to get
either one of us in trouble,

909
00:34:42,295 --> 00:34:44,974
but I do have
a small favor to ask.

910
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:49,987
<i>Dr. Axford to the ER.
Dr. James Axford to the ER.</i>

911
00:34:50,074 --> 00:34:51,950
Austin is okay,

912
00:34:52,155 --> 00:34:54,317
but his head
was seriously injured...

913
00:34:54,409 --> 00:34:56,651
Same with his pancreas,
which we had to remove.

914
00:34:56,739 --> 00:34:59,380
He's in the ICU,
but he's doing fine now.

915
00:34:59,468 --> 00:35:01,678
Oh. Thank God.

916
00:35:01,898 --> 00:35:03,722
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

917
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:04,841
Can I see him?

918
00:35:04,966 --> 00:35:07,159
- Me too.
- Yeah. I can take you now.

919
00:35:07,773 --> 00:35:10,099
Can I take pictures to send
into the costume contest?

920
00:35:10,284 --> 00:35:11,864
Maybe he could still win.

921
00:35:12,449 --> 00:35:15,380
Halloween really
brings out the weirdos.

922
00:35:16,053 --> 00:35:18,031
Okay, all you've done today
is complain...

923
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:19,732
The candy,
the costumes.

924
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:22,466
Catherine Fox may have made you
chief of chiefs,

925
00:35:22,554 --> 00:35:25,349
but she did not make you
the Halloween Grinch!

926
00:35:27,768 --> 00:35:29,181
Yeah. You're right.

927
00:35:29,283 --> 00:35:30,453
I'm sorry.

928
00:35:33,169 --> 00:35:34,364
That's it?

929
00:35:34,568 --> 00:35:36,821
No cynical argument?

930
00:35:36,916 --> 00:35:38,501
No snarky comeback?

931
00:35:39,457 --> 00:35:41,872
Yeah.
I used to like Halloween.

932
00:35:42,213 --> 00:35:44,836
But my son David...
Uh, he loved it.

933
00:35:44,958 --> 00:35:46,394
His mom didn't,
so every year,

934
00:35:46,482 --> 00:35:47,809
he and I'd put together
his costume

935
00:35:47,896 --> 00:35:49,451
and go trick-or-treating.
It was our thing.

936
00:35:49,538 --> 00:35:50,997
One year, he was, um...

937
00:35:53,709 --> 00:35:56,349
..he was really excited
about being Luke Skywalker.

938
00:35:56,437 --> 00:35:59,100
So, we were making
a stormtrooper, uh, belt,

939
00:35:59,188 --> 00:36:00,903
you know, like
he wore in the, um...

940
00:36:01,075 --> 00:36:02,667
When he got out of
the trash compactor.

941
00:36:02,755 --> 00:36:04,032
"Episode IV."

942
00:36:04,177 --> 00:36:05,452
Yeah.
It was a good costume.

943
00:36:05,539 --> 00:36:06,810
It was.

944
00:36:08,317 --> 00:36:09,911
Except he never got
a chance to wear it.

945
00:36:09,999 --> 00:36:11,940
He died two weeks
before Halloween,

946
00:36:12,028 --> 00:36:13,435
and I just...

947
00:36:14,302 --> 00:36:15,568
That unworn costume

948
00:36:15,655 --> 00:36:17,451
hung on the back of his door
for months.

949
00:36:17,539 --> 00:36:19,325
I couldn't bring myself
to...

950
00:36:20,158 --> 00:36:22,153
take it down and...

951
00:36:35,537 --> 00:36:36,607
Oh.

952
00:36:37,884 --> 00:36:40,360
Oh, uh... hey, hey, hey.

953
00:36:41,159 --> 00:36:43,004
Hey, take it,
take it, take it, take it. Ohh!

954
00:36:43,091 --> 00:36:44,403
What? What?

955
00:36:44,491 --> 00:36:46,659
That's okay.
No, no. No, no. Shh.

956
00:36:47,613 --> 00:36:48,911
It's okay. Come on.

957
00:36:50,339 --> 00:36:52,480
Easy, easy.

958
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:58,671
Let's get out of here.

959
00:36:58,773 --> 00:37:00,479
Today was a...
A nightmare.

960
00:37:00,567 --> 00:37:01,880
Hey.

961
00:37:02,448 --> 00:37:04,278
You are amazing.

962
00:37:04,411 --> 00:37:05,925
You are turning
a house of horrors

963
00:37:06,013 --> 00:37:06,992
into a legit hospital,

964
00:37:07,079 --> 00:37:09,282
and I am sorry if those
investors can't see that.

965
00:37:09,369 --> 00:37:10,466
Well, don't be.

966
00:37:10,554 --> 00:37:12,017
I'm getting
a new research facility.

967
00:37:12,105 --> 00:37:13,428
They gave you
the funding?

968
00:37:13,516 --> 00:37:14,553
Yeah, they said
they were impressed

969
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,562
with my ability to handle chaos.

970
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:18,050
They don't even know
the half of it.

971
00:37:18,161 --> 00:37:19,441
They should visit
your childhood.

972
00:37:20,683 --> 00:37:23,096
Hey, you know what?

973
00:37:23,347 --> 00:37:25,505
Yeah? We should do
something to celebrate.

974
00:37:25,688 --> 00:37:28,755
Great. I am absolutely
dressed for that.

975
00:37:30,789 --> 00:37:32,072
What?

976
00:37:32,568 --> 00:37:33,987

This is it...
Kick-ass surgeon!

1023
00:39:11,526 --> 00:39:12,519
- I love it.
- Okay, look,

1024
00:39:12,607 --> 00:39:14,551
I didn't have time to make
Leo and Allison costumes

1025
00:39:14,638 --> 00:39:15,746
and I am not gonna
sew costumes

1026
00:39:15,833 --> 00:39:17,720
and I am not gonna be
classroom mom

1027
00:39:17,808 --> 00:39:19,462
or do all the other things
that your mom did.

1028
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:20,622
Yeah. I know.
That's why

1029
00:39:20,709 --> 00:39:21,894
I brought
these old costumes

1030
00:39:21,982 --> 00:39:24,611
to see if they might fit
these guys.

1031
00:39:26,949 --> 00:39:28,242
- Oh.
- Wait.

1032
00:39:28,329 --> 00:39:31,253
You thought I wanted you
to sew costumes?

1033
00:39:31,729 --> 00:39:32,862
I...

1034
00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:34,239
So you thought
I made this special trip

1035
00:39:34,326 --> 00:39:36,449
just to hand you
my mom's old costumes

1036
00:39:36,537 --> 00:39:38,902
with the sole purpose
of shaming you?

1037
00:39:39,277 --> 00:39:41,423
Or, like, inspiring me?

1038
00:39:42,294 --> 00:39:45,058
I was inspired,
if that helps at all.

1039
00:39:45,417 --> 00:39:46,949
What are
they supposed to be?

1040
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:48,982
Zombies?

1041
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:51,055
You dressed our babies up
as dead babies?

1042
00:39:51,143 --> 00:39:53,049
Well, that's a terrible way to put it.

1043
00:39:53,136 --> 00:39:54,240
