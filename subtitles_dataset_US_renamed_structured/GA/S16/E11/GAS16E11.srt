62
00:02:24,303 --> 00:02:26,348
You told me to take
some time to think,

63
00:02:26,436 --> 00:02:29,539
which I didn't like, because
two people who are together

64
00:02:29,627 --> 00:02:31,418
should think through things
together.

65
00:02:33,098 --> 00:02:36,895
Look, I-I did a routine lap appy
on a patient,

66
00:02:36,983 --> 00:02:38,238
and she's
not getting better.

67
00:02:38,503 --> 00:02:40,454
She's post op day three,
she's fevering,

68
00:02:40,542 --> 00:02:41,502

71
00:02:46,301 --> 00:02:48,527

00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:50,379

84

I... I'm not sure
that I have the ability

85
00:03:26,856 --> 00:03:28,323
to convey
how much I hate this.

86
00:03:29,723 --> 00:03:31,097
But I promise you,

87
00:03:31,238 --> 00:03:33,316
no blood test can change
the way I feel about you.

88
00:03:33,404 --> 00:03:35,097
It's just a matter
of some cells.

89
00:03:36,464 --> 00:03:38,716
I... still have no idea
what you're talking about.

90
00:03:40,103 --> 00:03:42,846
I am more pregnant
than I thought.

91
00:03:43,597 --> 00:03:44,745
Okay...?

92
00:03:45,372 --> 00:03:48,652
Which means there is a chance
that you aren't the father.

93
00:03:54,216 --> 00:03:55,830
It took me a few days
to work up the nerve

94
00:03:55,917 --> 00:03:57,143
to tell you.

95
00:04:02,526 --> 00:04:04,149
We're talking about Owen,
right?

96
00:04:04,393 --> 00:04:05,659
Yeah.

97
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:07,379
Does he know?

98
00:04:08,667 --> 00:04:10,425
I'm talking to you first.

99
00:04:11,386 --> 00:04:13,259
Because I don't need
a paternity test

100
00:04:13,347 --> 00:04:15,245
to know that I want
to be with you.

101
00:04:16,097 --> 00:04:18,777
I love what we have.

102
00:04:19,347 --> 00:04:24,058
I love your kindness
and I love our ease

103
00:04:24,146 --> 00:04:28,222
and I love that you
make me laugh all the time

104
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,800
and you have yet
to make me cry.

105
00:04:32,581 --> 00:04:34,120
I'm in love with you,
Link.

106
00:04:35,518 --> 00:04:37,503
And the genetics
don't matter to me.

107
00:04:38,394 --> 00:04:40,386
But I have been sitting with it
for a few days,

108
00:04:40,473 --> 00:04:41,803
and you haven't.

109
00:04:43,401 --> 00:04:44,738
So...

110
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:52,026
Take some time
to think.

111
00:04:57,393 --> 00:04:58,972
Welcome back,
Dr. Bailey.

112
00:04:59,089 --> 00:05:01,511
Quick update on the residents...
We've removed Simms' trach

113
00:05:01,599 --> 00:05:03,011
and started him
on a soft diet.

114
00:05:03,099 --> 00:05:04,363
Helm's chest tubes
were removed,

115
00:05:04,451 --> 00:05:06,165
and she actually took
a couple steps today with PT.

116
00:05:06,252 --> 00:05:07,691
Parker left
for neural rehab,

117
00:05:07,779 --> 00:05:09,903
and Schmitt was discharged with
a couple weeks' medical leave.

118
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:11,443
Sounds like
you're pretty busy.

119
00:05:11,552 --> 00:05:12,863
Yeah, I am.

120
00:05:13,217 --> 00:05:15,097
So, why are you
glued to my side right now?

121
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,613
I was hoping you could weigh in
on an appy patient of mine.

122
00:05:17,701 --> 00:05:18,784
She's post-op day three.

123
00:05:18,872 --> 00:05:20,246
She's been giving me
more questions than answers.

124
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:21,488
Mm. Lead the way.

125
00:05:21,576 --> 00:05:23,821
Dr. Bailey. A funny thing
happened yesterday.

126
00:05:23,909 --> 00:05:25,386
I came to your office
for a budget meeting,

127
00:05:25,473 --> 00:05:26,386
and you weren't there.

128
00:05:26,474 --> 00:05:27,777
I took some personal days.

129
00:05:27,865 --> 00:05:30,040
Even when half your residents
are on bedpans?

130
00:05:30,128 --> 00:05:30,886
That's great timing,
Chief.

131
00:05:30,974 --> 00:05:32,434
I-I asked
some of the other departments

132
00:05:32,521 --> 00:05:33,605
to lend us
some residents

133
00:05:33,693 --> 00:05:35,181
for surgical floor
and ICU coverage.

134
00:05:35,269 --> 00:05:36,354
- They were happy to help.
- Even so,

135
00:05:36,441 --> 00:05:37,660
next time
you want to take a vacay,

136
00:05:37,747 --> 00:05:40,113
run it up the flagpole,
as in me.

137
00:05:41,831 --> 00:05:43,323
D... Uh, thank you.

138
00:05:43,411 --> 00:05:44,798
- Mom?
- Yes, honey?

139
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:46,253
Can I be done?

140
00:05:46,341 --> 00:05:49,284
Just a few more times, sweet girl.
You got this.

141
00:05:50,067 --> 00:05:51,641
Oh. It's her therapy.

142
00:05:51,729 --> 00:05:52,941
I know it looks nuts.

143
00:05:53,029 --> 00:05:55,269
Mei I. was adopted
from an orphanage,

144
00:05:55,357 --> 00:05:58,165
and she was recently diagnosed
with attachment disorder,

145
00:05:58,253 --> 00:05:59,598
so we've been doing
this crawling therapy

146
00:05:59,685 --> 00:06:01,433
because it's supposed to
rewire her brain.

147
00:06:01,521 --> 00:06:03,340
But you got to do it every day,
and you got to be

148
00:06:03,427 --> 00:06:05,525
super consistent with it
every day.

149
00:06:05,613 --> 00:06:07,800
Hi.
I'm her sister.

150
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:09,949
It was an appendectomy.
You said it went without a hitch.

151
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,321
So, um,
why are we still here?

152
00:06:11,409 --> 00:06:12,486
Take this. Please.

153
00:06:12,573 --> 00:06:13,981
She's been spiking fevers
every night.

154
00:06:14,069 --> 00:06:15,514
Yeah, I know.
I'm asking why.

155
00:06:15,602 --> 00:06:16,629
- And I have brought our
- Mom? Yes, sweetheart.

156
00:06:16,717 --> 00:06:18,301
chief of surgery to help
determine that.

157
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:20,169
- Uh, here. You, too, sweetheart.
- Here.

158
00:06:20,256 --> 00:06:21,549
Dr. Bailey,
Suzanne Britland.

159
00:06:21,644 --> 00:06:23,191
- Hi.
- Good morning.

160
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:24,489
Ms. Britland,
how are you feeling?

161
00:06:24,576 --> 00:06:26,456
- She has a sore throat.
- He has a sore throat.

162
00:06:26,566 --> 00:06:28,534
It's just a little sore.

163
00:06:29,339 --> 00:06:30,886
I'm probably
just getting a cold.

164
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:32,467
It could still be
from the intubation.

165
00:06:32,555 --> 00:06:33,402
Could be.

166
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:35,402
I know that the answer
is probably "no,"

167
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:37,454
but is there any way
you could just send me home

168
00:06:37,542 --> 00:06:38,596
with some antibiotics?

169
00:06:38,683 --> 00:06:41,089
Not until you've been fever-free
for 24 hours. I'm sorry.

170
00:06:41,177 --> 00:06:43,341
Oh, it's just, the kids are
missing so much school.

171
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:44,857
Well, I can take them
to school.

172
00:06:44,945 --> 00:06:45,945
- No!
- No!

173
00:06:47,362 --> 00:06:48,386
Okay.

174
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,839
It's okay.

175
00:06:52,676 --> 00:06:53,956
Their dad died
last year.

176
00:06:55,035 --> 00:06:57,698
He had a migraine,
and then when it got really bad,

177
00:06:57,786 --> 00:07:00,548
we took him to the ER,
and the doctors told us

178
00:07:00,636 --> 00:07:02,337
we could go home
and he would be fine,

179
00:07:02,425 --> 00:07:03,472
and then...

180
00:07:05,481 --> 00:07:06,981
..he very much wasn't.

181
00:07:08,904 --> 00:07:10,527
We are running
a fresh set of labs,

182
00:07:10,615 --> 00:07:12,245
and we hope
to know more soon.

183
00:07:12,729 --> 00:07:13,823
Okay.

184
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:25,286
Dr. Grey.

185
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:26,550
Hey.

186
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:29,402
So,
elephant in the room...

187
00:07:29,832 --> 00:07:32,253
I'm not sure what Cristina
said to you, but...

188
00:07:32,352 --> 00:07:33,753
- Who?
- ..I...

189
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:35,878
..never mind.
Who did you say?

190
00:07:35,995 --> 00:07:37,089
Never mind.

191
00:07:37,823 --> 00:07:38,966
Are you coming
to the pit?

192
00:07:39,089 --> 00:07:40,698
- What?
- The pit.

193
00:07:40,869 --> 00:07:42,643
- The what?
- The ER.

194
00:07:42,853 --> 00:07:44,292
You call the ER
"the pit"?

195
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,675
- Yeah.
- Why?

196
00:07:46,104 --> 00:07:47,331
I don't know.

197
00:07:51,581 --> 00:07:53,363
Oh, my God! Kai?

198
00:07:53,636 --> 00:07:54,527
What's happening
to him?

199
00:07:54,615 --> 00:07:55,938
What do we know?
17 years old.

200
00:07:56,026 --> 00:07:57,216
He came in with
shortness of breath.

201
00:07:57,303 --> 00:07:58,831
He just started
coughing up blood.

202
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:00,739
- We need suction and an intubation tray.
- Help him, please!

203
00:08:00,826 --> 00:08:03,470
We should set up for
an emergency bronchoscopy also.

207
00:08:36,964 --> 00:08:39,506
The door is frosted,
and the curtains were drawn.

208
00:08:39,593 --> 00:08:40,901
You can't see inside.

209
00:08:41,723 --> 00:08:42,973
Was I wrong?

210
00:08:45,222 --> 00:08:46,800
What are you doing here?

211
00:08:46,942 --> 00:08:49,136
Um, well, I was thinking
about taking you to breakfast,

212
00:08:49,224 --> 00:08:50,925
but, uh,
now that I see you,

213
00:08:51,013 --> 00:08:54,151
um, I'm thinking eat in.

214
00:08:54,745 --> 00:08:56,058
How's pancakes sound?

215
00:08:56,626 --> 00:08:57,626
What?

216
00:08:58,366 --> 00:08:59,917
I didn't know
you could cook.

217
00:09:00,893 --> 00:09:02,191
Please.

218
00:09:05,206 --> 00:09:06,386
Hey!

219
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:07,581
Hey.

220
00:09:07,693 --> 00:09:09,534
What's, uh...
What are we...

221
00:09:09,995 --> 00:09:11,922
Oh. Oh, wait.
Are you meditating?

222
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,933
- I'm sorry. I can...
- No. No, I was...

223
00:09:14,274 --> 00:09:16,637
Amelia said
the baby might be Owen's.

224
00:09:16,725 --> 00:09:17,730
What?

225
00:09:17,818 --> 00:09:19,102
Somebody help me, please!

226
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:21,845
All these blue pajamas, I can't
get any help over here?!

227
00:09:21,933 --> 00:09:23,598
- Oh, sorry. The ER's this way.
- What happened?

228
00:09:23,685 --> 00:09:26,056
We'll go get your hand fixed up,
and I promise you can punch me.

229
00:09:26,143 --> 00:09:26,886
Okay,
what happened?

230
00:09:26,974 --> 00:09:28,506
I'm trying to rush Chuck
to the ER,

231
00:09:28,594 --> 00:09:30,582
and I accidentally slammed
his hand in the cab's door.

232
00:09:30,669 --> 00:09:32,162
Wait. Why were you
rushing to the ER?

233
00:09:32,256 --> 00:09:33,419
Oh,
because of the fish.

234
00:09:35,357 --> 00:09:36,878
There's a fish
inside of there.

235
00:09:36,966 --> 00:09:39,173
What, like... like,
part of a fish or a bone or...

236
00:09:39,261 --> 00:09:40,924
No,
an entire fish, sir.

237
00:09:42,675 --> 00:09:44,306
- Okay, Link, with you...
- Later.

238
00:09:44,393 --> 00:09:45,761
Spilling blood
everywhere.

239
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:48,675
Kai's bronchoscopy was
surprisingly clean.

240
00:09:48,763 --> 00:09:50,176
We didn't see any bleeding
in his lungs,

241
00:09:50,263 --> 00:09:51,441
just some inflammation.

242
00:09:51,529 --> 00:09:52,562
Isn't that good news?

243
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:54,495
Not exactly.
Dr. Grey did an EGD.

244
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:56,616
She found the source
of the bleed in his esophagus.

245
00:09:56,693 --> 00:09:58,526
We're just not sure
exactly why he's bleeding.

246
00:09:58,621 --> 00:10:00,494
Everything was normal
at practice.

247
00:10:00,878 --> 00:10:02,300
He started hacking up
like crazy.

248
00:10:02,388 --> 00:10:03,378
I mean,
Kai's never sick.

249
00:10:03,466 --> 00:10:04,790
Kai's the best
on the team.

250
00:10:04,878 --> 00:10:06,846
He's got the fastest 200
in the school's history.

251
00:10:06,933 --> 00:10:07,964
Does he drink or smoke?

252
00:10:08,052 --> 00:10:09,755
No way. All he cares about
is his swimming.

253
00:10:09,843 --> 00:10:11,987
This bleeding...
You can stop it?

254
00:10:12,075 --> 00:10:13,895
We stopped it long enough
to get your son up to CT,

255
00:10:13,982 --> 00:10:15,772
so we'll keep you posted,
okay?

256
00:10:19,776 --> 00:10:22,495
All the places in the world
to put food...

257
00:10:22,588 --> 00:10:24,026
and yet, no food.

258
00:10:25,331 --> 00:10:26,415
How do you people
eat here?

259
00:10:26,503 --> 00:10:28,657
Three kids who eat
like a pack of wolves.

260
00:10:28,766 --> 00:10:31,016
Richard, you don't
have to do this.

261
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:32,909
What am I doing here?

262
00:10:33,152 --> 00:10:36,311
Forgiving me or... or...
putting me back together.

263
00:10:36,393 --> 00:10:37,466
Whatever this is.

264
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:39,602
It's called... eating.

265
00:10:40,287 --> 00:10:41,790
And I don't deserve it.

266
00:10:41,878 --> 00:10:43,431
Especially not from you.

267
00:10:46,602 --> 00:10:49,477
We just hired
an amazing psychologist

268
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:50,938
at Pac-North.

269
00:10:51,183 --> 00:10:52,766
She's excellent with sur...

270
00:10:52,853 --> 00:10:54,096
with surgeons
who kill their cousins

271
00:10:54,183 --> 00:10:56,053
and get sued
by their uncles?

272
00:10:58,081 --> 00:11:00,681
I'm sorry. I'm...

273
00:11:01,762 --> 00:11:03,876
I shouldn't...
I...

274
00:11:04,222 --> 00:11:07,673
I'm useless and mean
and depressed and awful.

275
00:11:07,761 --> 00:11:09,505
This is why I just...
I want to be alone.

276
00:11:09,593 --> 00:11:11,886
Can... Can we just go back
to that?

277
00:11:12,001 --> 00:11:14,782
Can we go back to you just not
even being able to look at me?

278
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:18,016
Maybe we start
with coffee.

279
00:11:23,359 --> 00:11:24,765
Hey. Hey!

280
00:11:24,853 --> 00:11:25,913
- Hey.
- Hi!

281
00:11:27,149 --> 00:11:28,173
What are you doing here?

282
00:11:28,261 --> 00:11:29,774
I am on my day off,

283
00:11:29,861 --> 00:11:31,774
and I want
to take you for lunch,

284
00:11:31,862 --> 00:11:33,009
and I want to see you.

285
00:11:33,097 --> 00:11:34,462
And...

286
00:11:36,053 --> 00:11:37,563
I want to talk
wedding plans.

287
00:11:37,802 --> 00:11:39,835
- That's so sweet.
- Mm-hmm.

288
00:11:40,008 --> 00:11:41,516
Mm.

289
00:11:44,338 --> 00:11:45,431
I'm sorry.

290
00:11:45,696 --> 00:11:46,798
I lost
your engagement ring.

291
00:11:46,886 --> 00:11:48,142
I lost the ring
that your grandfather

292
00:11:48,229 --> 00:11:50,508
brought back from France
after he helped liberate Paris.

293
00:11:50,596 --> 00:11:53,339
And I knew that this is such an
important ring to your family,

294
00:11:53,427 --> 00:11:55,850
and I wasn't gonna tell you,
but then I knew

295
00:11:55,938 --> 00:11:57,506
that you were obviously
gonna notice and...

296
00:11:57,593 --> 00:11:59,665
- Teddy, Teddy, stop crying.
- It's okay. It's okay.

297
00:11:59,753 --> 00:12:02,166
No! No! It's... It's not.
It's not okay.

298
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:04,024
This ring means everything
to you.

299
00:12:04,112 --> 00:12:06,079
Maybe a little.
More to my mom.

300
00:12:06,167 --> 00:12:07,329
You know,
she's gonna kill me.

301
00:12:07,417 --> 00:12:08,740
Or you.

302
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:10,298
S-She's not gonna know,
okay?

303
00:12:10,386 --> 00:12:13,470
We're not gonna say anything
because we are going to find it.

304
00:12:13,915 --> 00:12:15,391
Okay?

305
00:12:15,563 --> 00:12:17,477
Okay, we'll look together.
Okay?

306
00:12:17,567 --> 00:12:18,681
Okay.

307
00:12:20,734 --> 00:12:23,048
Alright,
what happened, exactly?

308
00:12:23,203 --> 00:12:24,805
The bar had an aquarium.

309
00:12:24,946 --> 00:12:27,466
Alright, so we're winding down
Chuck's bachelor party.

310
00:12:27,553 --> 00:12:29,338
You know what I'm saying?
It's his bachelor party.

311
00:12:29,425 --> 00:12:30,733
So, we start
daring each other

312
00:12:30,821 --> 00:12:32,176
to swallow fish
from the aquarium.

313
00:12:32,286 --> 00:12:34,110
You know how it is...
End of the night?

314
00:12:34,247 --> 00:12:35,450
- Yeah. Okay.
- No.

315
00:12:35,688 --> 00:12:38,238
I honestly worry for
your entire gender sometimes.

316
00:12:38,326 --> 00:12:40,265
Anyway, he grabbed
the biggest one.

317
00:12:40,353 --> 00:12:41,386
We didn't think
he was gonna do it.

318
00:12:41,473 --> 00:12:42,636
We're like,
"He ain't about to do it."

319
00:12:42,723 --> 00:12:44,136
He gulps
the whole damn fish,

320
00:12:44,223 --> 00:12:45,650
and I guess
the fish didn't like that,

321
00:12:45,737 --> 00:12:48,266
so the fish start fighting back,
start slapping...

322
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:50,980
just start going crazy,
and it goes in deeper, deeper.

323
00:12:51,067 --> 00:12:52,993
We tried to pull it out.
It would not come out.

324
00:12:53,087 --> 00:12:54,290
And then
it kind of puffed up.

325
00:12:54,378 --> 00:12:56,569
That... doesn't sound like
a goldfish.

326
00:12:56,657 --> 00:12:57,596
Yeah. No.

327
00:12:57,683 --> 00:12:59,926
And according to this X-ray,
this thing's got spikes.

328
00:13:00,102 --> 00:13:01,204
And then I got scared

329
00:13:01,292 --> 00:13:02,783
because I thought
he was gonna choke or puke.

330
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:05,220
Or that the fish
could be poisonous.

331
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:08,345
I didn't even think
of that.

332
00:13:08,445 --> 00:13:10,845
I'm-a call the bar,
see what kind of fish it was.

333
00:13:13,104 --> 00:13:15,227
You think you'd have better luck
just writing it down?

334
00:13:15,641 --> 00:13:17,551
Oh, yeah.
Write it down.

335
00:13:19,035 --> 00:13:22,618
"Please don't tell
Roxanne."

336
00:13:22,868 --> 00:13:24,003
Yeah,
that's his fiancée.

337
00:13:24,091 --> 00:13:26,196
She told us
not to do anything stupid.

338
00:13:30,617 --> 00:13:32,688
- Hey. - Aptitude is like
having a talent for something.

339
00:13:32,775 --> 00:13:34,117
Great.
Okay, what do we got next?

340
00:13:34,272 --> 00:13:35,968
Ooh. "Penultimate."

341
00:13:36,242 --> 00:13:38,085
Uh, uh...
I don't know.

342
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:41,038
"Guys, that was
the penultimate concert."

343
00:13:41,135 --> 00:13:43,320
Wait, was it the second-to-last
concert you ever saw?

344
00:13:43,433 --> 00:13:45,079
'Cause "penultimate"
means "second-to-last."

345
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:46,719
It does not mean
"super-extra ultimate."

346
00:13:46,806 --> 00:13:48,259
- Mom, the doctors.
- What? Really?

347
00:13:48,347 --> 00:13:50,570
Vocab homework. Did you know
that "penultimate" means...

348
00:13:50,658 --> 00:13:52,191
"Second-to-last."
Yeah, I knew that.

349
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:54,929
Excellent. Any chance you also
know what's wrong with my sister?

350
00:13:55,017 --> 00:13:58,560
Well, the labs showed your
white counts are way up again.

351
00:13:58,648 --> 00:14:01,757
It's likely just an abscess
developing in your abdomen.

352
00:14:01,845 --> 00:14:03,344
We'd like to monitor you
one more night,

353
00:14:03,431 --> 00:14:05,604
get a CT in the morning
if things don't improve.

354
00:14:05,775 --> 00:14:07,117
No!
No more days!

355
00:14:07,205 --> 00:14:09,110
- Okay, come on, guys.
We listen to the doctors. <font color=#ffff00>- Okay, okay.</font>

356
00:14:09,197 --> 00:14:10,648
We are not big fans
of hospitals,

357
00:14:10,736 --> 00:14:13,031
'cause, you know...
last time.

358
00:14:13,429 --> 00:14:15,669
So, we are keeping
brave faces,

359
00:14:15,757 --> 00:14:18,788
but we would very much like
for last night to be

360
00:14:18,921 --> 00:14:20,875
my penultimate night
in the hospital.

361
00:14:20,963 --> 00:14:21,966
Ding, ding, ding!

362
00:14:22,054 --> 00:14:23,804
See, that is
the correct usage.

363
00:14:23,952 --> 00:14:25,163
Lock it in, Matty.

364
00:14:25,405 --> 00:14:29,055
Well, I can't see
why we need to wait,

365
00:14:29,143 --> 00:14:31,506
so, DeLuca,
let's get her a CT now.

366
00:14:31,593 --> 00:14:32,893
Okay.

367
00:14:37,734 --> 00:14:39,390
His friend called the bar.

368
00:14:39,554 --> 00:14:41,015
The bronze catfish.

369
00:14:41,103 --> 00:14:42,806
The spines do give off
a low-level toxin

370
00:14:42,894 --> 00:14:44,210
when attacked
by other fish.

371
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,293
Or being swallowed
by a dumb-ass human.

372
00:14:46,381 --> 00:14:48,971
But it's not enough
to worry about, so...

373
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:53,543
So...

374
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:55,867
..you're not freaking out?

375
00:14:56,577 --> 00:14:57,613
What?

376
00:14:57,715 --> 00:14:58,812
No.

377
00:14:58,928 --> 00:15:00,921
No, it doesn't really
change anything, right?

378
00:15:01,226 --> 00:15:03,531
Except for, like,
everything.

379
00:15:03,763 --> 00:15:05,921
If it's Owen's kid, he's gonna
want to be in his life.

380
00:15:06,009 --> 00:15:07,609
He's gonna want
to raise him, right?

381
00:15:07,834 --> 00:15:10,913
Allison's awesome,
so Owen's got great genes,

382
00:15:11,142 --> 00:15:13,820
he's a veteran dad by now,
and he's engaged to Teddy,

383
00:15:13,908 --> 00:15:15,648
so the kid'll have,
like, eight parents.

384
00:15:17,028 --> 00:15:18,843
It's all hypothetical,
anyway.

385
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:20,445
Amelia doesn't want
a paternity test.

386
00:15:20,533 --> 00:15:21,426
She says
it doesn't matter.

387
00:15:21,514 --> 00:15:22,851
Wai... What?!

388
00:15:23,442 --> 00:15:25,355
And you're okay with that?

389
00:15:25,553 --> 00:15:27,859
Oh, wait, wait, are you doing
that thing where you pretend

390
00:15:27,947 --> 00:15:29,712
to be all cool and evolved
and optimistic

391
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,048
but you're secretly
losing your mind?

392
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:34,712
Nope.

393
00:15:34,941 --> 00:15:36,644
You can love her

394
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:39,251
And be mad at her
at the same time.

395
00:15:39,928 --> 00:15:42,204
Both things can be true.

396
00:15:50,096 --> 00:15:52,548
Yesterday,
I made coffee in here,

397
00:15:52,636 --> 00:15:54,407
and then
I washed my hands.

398
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:55,782
So, you're sure
that it's here?

399
00:15:56,056 --> 00:15:57,062
I think.

400
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:58,136
Wait. Wait.
You think?

401
00:15:58,223 --> 00:15:59,743
Teddy, are we even
in the right lounge?

402
00:15:59,877 --> 00:16:02,290
Yes, yes, because I showed it
to Meredith in here,

403
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:03,705
and she said
that it was beautiful.

404
00:16:03,792 --> 00:16:05,425
Well, that's great.

405
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:06,720
Oh, hey.

406
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:10,246
You're... operating
on a sink.

407
00:16:10,334 --> 00:16:11,845
Yeah, we're looking
for a ring.

408
00:16:11,933 --> 00:16:14,525
You haven't seen one,
by chance, have you?

409
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:16,572
No.

410
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:18,439
Uh, maybe
we should, um,

411
00:16:18,527 --> 00:16:19,612
maybe we should
call maintenance.

412
00:16:19,699 --> 00:16:21,048
Yep. I don't think
it's down here.

413
00:16:22,665 --> 00:16:23,901
Okay.

414
00:16:25,435 --> 00:16:26,888
Are you okay?

415
00:16:27,093 --> 00:16:28,267
Hey.

416
00:16:29,298 --> 00:16:30,837
U-Uh... dizzy.

417
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:32,321
A... little dizzy.

418
00:16:32,409 --> 00:16:35,112
It happens with,
um... anxiety.

419
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,863
- You... You should sit down.
- Yes.

420
00:16:36,951 --> 00:16:38,962
I think
I should sit down, too.

421
00:16:41,197 --> 00:16:42,716
Why are you anxious?

422
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:44,361
I-I'm worried about...

423
00:16:45,999 --> 00:16:47,179
..your ring.

424
00:16:47,267 --> 00:16:48,623
- Teddy?
- Yeah?

425
00:16:48,711 --> 00:16:50,681
Leo just threw up
all over daycare.

426
00:16:51,045 --> 00:16:52,588
We should...

427
00:17:02,394 --> 00:17:04,470
I've got a couple of boys
at home this age.

428
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,157
I had to read
a whole book

429
00:17:07,245 --> 00:17:09,528
about how their brains
haven't fully developed yet.

430
00:17:09,616 --> 00:17:11,725
It's the only way
I could manage to forgive them.

431
00:17:13,197 --> 00:17:14,381
For what?

432
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,611
Everything they do.

433
00:17:16,993 --> 00:17:18,698
I came home the other night,
and the oldest one

434
00:17:18,785 --> 00:17:20,585
was throwing a tennis ball
as hard as he could

435
00:17:20,672 --> 00:17:22,569
over and over
at the younger one's head.

436
00:17:23,263 --> 00:17:24,966
The game was,
could his brother dodge it

437
00:17:25,053 --> 00:17:26,366
before he got
brain damage?

438
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,910
Sorry.
I shouldn't laugh at that.

439
00:17:32,223 --> 00:17:34,069
Listen, Grey, uh...

440
00:17:35,441 --> 00:17:36,655
the other day...

441
00:17:37,433 --> 00:17:39,136
it was kind of a tough day
for me.

442
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,136
I get a bit dark
this time of year

443
00:17:41,223 --> 00:17:42,676
because it's, um...

444
00:17:43,084 --> 00:17:44,884
it's when I lost their mum.

445
00:17:46,546 --> 00:17:47,920
Cancer.

446
00:17:48,975 --> 00:17:50,608
So, um...

447
00:17:50,983 --> 00:17:52,819
you know,
I hope we can...

448
00:17:53,433 --> 00:17:55,096
start over.

449
00:17:55,542 --> 00:17:56,967
Sure.

450
00:17:58,998 --> 00:18:00,803
How long ago
did she pass?

451
00:18:02,197 --> 00:18:03,987
Uh, two years ago
last week.

452
00:18:06,388 --> 00:18:08,076
Two years is tough.

453
00:18:08,551 --> 00:18:09,844
Yeah.

454
00:18:10,337 --> 00:18:11,707
Gets better.

455
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:15,366
Not all the way better,
obviously,

456
00:18:15,454 --> 00:18:17,951
but...
a little bit better.

457
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,178
Look at the inflammation
in his lungs.

458
00:18:24,536 --> 00:18:26,975
I mean... you said
he was an athlete.

459
00:18:27,063 --> 00:18:29,592
These are the lungs
of a 60-year-old smoker.

460
00:18:30,642 --> 00:18:32,170
I've seen this before.

461
00:18:32,427 --> 00:18:34,700
I bet you a naggin
he vapes.

462
00:18:36,262 --> 00:18:37,606
Vaping? No way!

463
00:18:37,694 --> 00:18:39,342
He follows
all the training rules.

464
00:18:39,983 --> 00:18:41,446
This is no time
for secrets, lads.

465
00:18:41,534 --> 00:18:42,616
If you know
something...

466
00:18:43,052 --> 00:18:44,826
I mean, yeah.
He vapes.

467
00:18:44,914 --> 00:18:46,117
Half the school does,
though.

468
00:18:46,419 --> 00:18:47,673
And, I mean,
it wouldn't hurt him.

469
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,753
It's not like
smoking.

470
00:18:48,841 --> 00:18:50,134
How is it
not like smoking?

471
00:18:50,297 --> 00:18:51,545
There's no smoke.

472
00:18:51,633 --> 00:18:53,916
Your lungs are meant
to inhale air, not smoke

473
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:55,787
and not vapors
filled with chemicals.

474
00:18:55,973 --> 00:18:57,053
Look.

475
00:18:57,686 --> 00:18:58,912
See there?

476
00:18:59,101 --> 00:19:00,764
That's what a normal lung
looks like.

477
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:04,926
That's your mate's lungs.

478
00:19:05,131 --> 00:19:06,358
Does that look safe
to you?

479
00:19:06,469 --> 00:19:08,162
Damn. That's disgusting.

480
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:09,936
Disgusting?
It's more than disgusting.

481
00:19:10,024 --> 00:19:11,062
People are dying
from this stuff.

482
00:19:11,149 --> 00:19:12,425
Go and tell your friends.

483
00:19:12,513 --> 00:19:13,621
I mean it! Go!

484
00:19:13,709 --> 00:19:14,701
Go and tell
half the school

485
00:19:14,789 --> 00:19:15,976
they're turning their lungs
into rubbish dumps.

486
00:19:16,063 --> 00:19:17,600
Get out of my face!
Go!

487
00:19:17,728 --> 00:19:19,780
You said "dying."
Is my son dying?

488
00:19:19,868 --> 00:19:21,319
No. He's not.

489
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:22,671
But with his lungs
in this bad a shape,

490
00:19:22,758 --> 00:19:24,312
our only definitive option
is to repair the esophagus

491
00:19:24,399 --> 00:19:25,358
and remove part of the lung.
Remove p...

492
00:19:25,446 --> 00:19:27,287
Well, it's not
our only option.

493
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,804
I mean, we could try to stop the
bleeding by coiling the artery.

494
00:19:29,891 --> 00:19:31,608
Then he would lose
less lung capacity.

495
00:19:31,696 --> 00:19:32,851
Yes, but it might not
be enough

496
00:19:32,938 --> 00:19:34,192
to prevent more bleeding
in the future.

497
00:19:34,279 --> 00:19:35,350
That's true.

498
00:19:35,438 --> 00:19:37,025
But if it were my kid,
I guess I would just rather

499
00:19:37,112 --> 00:19:38,855
take the least invasive
option

500
00:19:38,959 --> 00:19:42,175
and try to not cut
a piece of the lung out.

501
00:19:42,303 --> 00:19:43,584
That sounds safer.

502
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:46,662
It is safer, and it
preserves lung function.

503
00:19:46,824 --> 00:19:48,364
Then that's what I want.

504
00:19:49,951 --> 00:19:51,803
Okay.
We'll get back to you.

505
00:19:52,412 --> 00:19:53,873
In that case, Dr. Grey,
I'll defer to you.

506
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,023
Well, no. I mean,
I didn't mean

507
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,638
- No, please. You should do it.
- That I...

508
00:19:56,725 --> 00:19:57,832
Okay.

509
00:19:59,206 --> 00:20:00,491
Rubbish dumps, huh?

510
00:20:00,811 --> 00:20:02,386
You really like
terrifying these parents.

511
00:20:02,473 --> 00:20:04,893
I was trying
to terrify the kids.

512
00:20:07,394 --> 00:20:09,795
Richard, I just want
to be alone.

513
00:20:10,248 --> 00:20:11,881
I want to be alone,
too.

514
00:20:12,584 --> 00:20:16,553
But I came here
to find out why you quit.

515
00:20:19,918 --> 00:20:23,716
Maggie, you're family,
and you're hurting,

516
00:20:23,975 --> 00:20:25,998
and you're hiding
because you lost Sabi.

517
00:20:26,207 --> 00:20:28,201
You've lost patients
before.

518
00:20:28,709 --> 00:20:30,246
Not like this.

519
00:20:31,285 --> 00:20:33,670
Maggie, she was practically dead
when she came in.

520
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:36,139
Her only shot
was with you.

521
00:20:36,227 --> 00:20:38,668
Richard...
let's not pretend...

522
00:20:38,756 --> 00:20:41,262
Look, the reason
I couldn't look at you

523
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:43,069
isn't because of
what you did to Sabi.

524
00:20:43,157 --> 00:20:45,889
It's because of
what I did to you.

525
00:20:46,194 --> 00:20:47,537
I...

526
00:20:47,933 --> 00:20:49,444
I sent you in there.

527
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,850
I knew that it was likely
that you would lose her,

528
00:20:51,938 --> 00:20:54,221
but I wanted to give her
a fighting chance.

529
00:20:54,381 --> 00:20:57,053
She wasn't a lost cause,
Richard.

530
00:20:58,689 --> 00:21:00,342
I made a mistake.

531
00:21:00,764 --> 00:21:03,306
I didn't check her ACT
with the perfusionist.

532
00:21:04,061 --> 00:21:05,530
I, uh, I didn't...

533
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:08,686
know that the protocol was
different at Pac-North.

534
00:21:08,774 --> 00:21:11,267
I just assumed they'd tell me,
and they didn't.

535
00:21:11,432 --> 00:21:13,647
Sabi is dead
because I didn't ask.

536
00:21:13,776 --> 00:21:16,405
I told her I was the best,
I told her I was brilliant,

537
00:21:16,493 --> 00:21:19,655
and I-I couldn't
even be clear in my OR.

538
00:21:20,162 --> 00:21:23,365
I was arrogant,
and I was blinded by emotion,

539
00:21:23,452 --> 00:21:25,285
and now Sabi is dead.

540
00:21:25,841 --> 00:21:28,350
And I can't change it,
and I can't fix it.

541
00:21:29,042 --> 00:21:32,268
And I can't go back into an OR
and pretend I belong there

542
00:21:32,356 --> 00:21:33,486
after what I've done.

543
00:21:34,779 --> 00:21:36,192
Please, just go.

544
00:21:40,005 --> 00:21:41,287
Please.

545
00:22:03,451 --> 00:22:05,881
- What'd he have for breakfast?
- Oatmeal.

546
00:22:05,969 --> 00:22:07,671
He probably caught something
from that kid Lucas.

547
00:22:07,758 --> 00:22:10,498
I swear, he is Patient Zero
for half this hospital.

548
00:22:12,362 --> 00:22:14,775
You know, getting an X-ray
probably wasn't even necessary.

549
00:22:14,863 --> 00:22:16,937
Well, you said that he didn't
seem like himself this morning.

550
00:22:17,024 --> 00:22:18,664
Well,
I say a lot of things.

551
00:22:18,774 --> 00:22:20,306
See?
What?

552
00:22:20,393 --> 00:22:21,926
You are mad at me
about the ring.

553
00:22:22,013 --> 00:22:23,321
I'm not mad.
I'm just...

554
00:22:23,409 --> 00:22:25,925
You are. You're practically
biting the air as you speak.

555
00:22:26,013 --> 00:22:27,219
What? I'm...

556
00:22:27,307 --> 00:22:29,330
Images should be coming up now
on the monitor right there.

557
00:22:29,417 --> 00:22:30,460
Great. Thank you.

558
00:22:36,102 --> 00:22:37,959
- Is that...
- Yep.

559
00:22:38,047 --> 00:22:39,556
Oh, Leo.

560
00:22:39,765 --> 00:22:40,812
You ate my ring.

561
00:22:44,223 --> 00:22:45,500
Okay.

562
00:22:45,735 --> 00:22:47,102
There it is.

563
00:22:48,052 --> 00:22:49,385
Deploying the coil.

564
00:22:49,473 --> 00:22:50,493
Nice.

565
00:22:50,748 --> 00:22:52,121
Steady coming back.

566
00:22:52,516 --> 00:22:54,119
You know, if you wanted
to do this yourself,

567
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:56,119
I did offer you
the option.

568
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,006
I didn't want
to do it myself.

569
00:22:58,329 --> 00:22:59,386
This isn't the first time

570
00:22:59,473 --> 00:23:00,908
I've seen lungs
destroyed by this stuff.

571
00:23:00,995 --> 00:23:02,038
That's how
I recognized it.

572
00:23:02,126 --> 00:23:03,619
Very often,
there is a rebleed.

573
00:23:05,854 --> 00:23:07,847
Yep. There it is.
Damn it!

574
00:23:07,988 --> 00:23:09,772
The tube's only a temporary fix.
We need to open him up.

575
00:23:09,859 --> 00:23:12,321
Okay, wait a minute,
because maybe I can deploy another coil.

576
00:23:12,473 --> 00:23:13,962
He doesn't have a minute.
The coils have failed.

577
00:23:14,049 --> 00:23:15,178
This is exactly
what I was talking about.

578
00:23:15,265 --> 00:23:16,888
Prep his chest
for a thoracotomy.

579
00:23:17,286 --> 00:23:18,555
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be sorry.

580
00:23:18,643 --> 00:23:20,243
Tried it your way.
Now help me with mine.

581
00:23:24,066 --> 00:23:25,559
Damn it.

582
00:23:25,803 --> 00:23:28,188
It keeps breaking
into smaller pieces.

583
00:23:28,593 --> 00:23:30,438
Every time
I think I've seen

584
00:23:30,526 --> 00:23:34,684
the craziest, dumbest things
a person can do...

585
00:23:34,841 --> 00:23:37,384
the ER's just like,
"Hold my beer."

586
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:38,885
Maybe he had
reservations.

587
00:23:38,973 --> 00:23:40,505
Maybe this is
the sort of thing

588
00:23:40,593 --> 00:23:42,958
he would never do
in a million years,

589
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:45,426
but he was in the moment.

590
00:23:45,546 --> 00:23:47,926
He was feeling good
and... and... and happy,

591
00:23:48,116 --> 00:23:50,426
and his friends had just
thrown him this great party,

592
00:23:50,513 --> 00:23:51,824
and he didn't want
to let them down.

593
00:23:51,911 --> 00:23:53,965
So, he was just
in this impossible situation

594
00:23:54,053 --> 00:23:55,397
that couldn't be avoided.

595
00:23:56,139 --> 00:23:59,473
Except... if he just didn't
swallow the fish, man.

596
00:24:01,803 --> 00:24:03,723
Right. Okay.

597
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,373
Drill.

598
00:24:09,803 --> 00:24:11,100
Stapler.

599
00:24:11,697 --> 00:24:13,480
Good exposure
of the fistula.

600
00:24:13,723 --> 00:24:15,772
Full disclosure...
This isn't the first time

601
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:18,514
I've had the debate about whether
to coil or resect, either.

602
00:24:18,602 --> 00:24:20,710
No? So, I was wrong
but I'm not alone?

603
00:24:20,798 --> 00:24:21,952
- Thanks.
- No.

604
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,743
Last time,
I was on your side.

605
00:24:24,026 --> 00:24:26,428
Woman in her 40s, vaped like a chimney.

606
00:24:26,516 --> 00:24:29,132
I was convinced I could coil
and stop the bleeding,

607
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:31,366
even though my colleague
adamantly disagreed.

608
00:24:31,454 --> 00:24:34,374
I didn't even get as far as you did
before everything went sideways.

609
00:24:34,671 --> 00:24:35,780
Specimen.

610
00:24:39,866 --> 00:24:41,514
Who was the colleague?

611
00:24:41,727 --> 00:24:43,590
Head of
the Klausman Institute.

612
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,538
Dr. Yang.

613
00:24:45,746 --> 00:24:47,155
Absolute nightmare.

614
00:24:49,142 --> 00:24:51,194
Oh, wow.

615
00:24:51,347 --> 00:24:53,387
I do not like it in here.

616
00:24:54,723 --> 00:24:56,176
Feels like...

617
00:24:56,272 --> 00:24:57,926
the inside of a coffin.

618
00:24:58,569 --> 00:25:01,702
You know, I've never actually
been in a coffin, but this is

619
00:25:01,889 --> 00:25:03,765
definitely how
I pictured it feeling.

620
00:25:04,985 --> 00:25:06,608
We're almost done here,
Suzanne.

621
00:25:07,845 --> 00:25:10,069
There's no signs of abscess
in the right lower quadrant.

622
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:13,673
So, whatever this is,
it's likely not your screw-up.

623
00:25:14,143 --> 00:25:16,116
Oh.
So, I-I heard right.

624
00:25:16,204 --> 00:25:18,947
Nurse told me my chief was
doing follow-ups on an appy.

625
00:25:19,035 --> 00:25:21,328
Seemed too crazy to be true,
but here we are.

626
00:25:21,416 --> 00:25:22,540
I guess it makes sense,
though.

627
00:25:22,627 --> 00:25:24,417
Ease yourself back
into the real work. Y...

628
00:25:29,603 --> 00:25:30,806
Everything okay?

629
00:25:30,894 --> 00:25:32,967
Not really,
but thanks for asking.

630
00:25:34,973 --> 00:25:36,161
What?

631
00:25:36,802 --> 00:25:38,596
I'm calling a code.
Oh, get her out. Get her out!

632
00:25:38,683 --> 00:25:41,266
Code Blue.
Code Blue.

633
00:25:41,353 --> 00:25:43,053
Blood pressure's
dropping.

634
00:25:43,974 --> 00:25:45,176
Mm. JVD.

635
00:25:45,263 --> 00:25:46,419
And muffled heart sounds.

636
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:48,099
She's got
cardiac tamponade.

637
00:25:48,187 --> 00:25:49,391
She's not gonna make it
to the OR.

638
00:25:49,478 --> 00:25:50,904
We need to aspirate her
right here.

639
00:25:50,992 --> 00:25:52,506
Okay, give me an 18 gauge needle
on a syringe.

640
00:25:52,593 --> 00:25:53,926
Betadine.

641
00:25:54,013 --> 00:25:55,596
Come on, Suzanne.

642
00:25:55,683 --> 00:25:56,766
Inserting the needle.

643
00:25:58,763 --> 00:25:59,966
Come on. Come on!

644
00:26:00,054 --> 00:26:03,085
Come on. Suzanne, come on!
Those kids need you.

645
00:26:08,092 --> 00:26:09,819
I managed to remove
all the spines.

646
00:26:09,946 --> 00:26:11,764
You're likely gonna
experience some discomfort

647
00:26:11,852 --> 00:26:13,475
in your throat
for the next few days.

648
00:26:13,663 --> 00:26:14,944
And your hand
is repaired.

649
00:26:15,032 --> 00:26:16,656
Uh, but I need to have you
follow up with me

650
00:26:16,743 --> 00:26:17,796
in a couple of weeks.

651
00:26:17,884 --> 00:26:19,913
Hey, so, you guys, uh...
You guys are smart.

652
00:26:20,001 --> 00:26:21,151
You're doctors, right?

653
00:26:21,239 --> 00:26:22,848
So, how do I
tell Roxanne?

654
00:26:22,936 --> 00:26:24,443
I mean, what should I
tell my fiancée?

655
00:26:24,531 --> 00:26:26,524
Maybe just tell her
the truth.

656
00:26:26,612 --> 00:26:28,249
She might think
it's hilarious.

657
00:26:28,593 --> 00:26:31,069
No, she definitely won't
think it's hilarious.

658
00:26:31,157 --> 00:26:32,844
I don't know, man.
She looked past that time

659
00:26:32,931 --> 00:26:34,464
you crashed her Volvo
into that pond

660
00:26:34,552 --> 00:26:36,215
or when you sorta
got her dad arrested.

661
00:26:36,333 --> 00:26:38,343
No known predators,
Chuck!

662
00:26:38,431 --> 00:26:39,684
Hey, babe!

663
00:26:39,772 --> 00:26:42,845
The bronze catfish has
no known predators, Chuck!

664
00:26:43,123 --> 00:26:44,416
She knows.

665
00:26:44,504 --> 00:26:46,136
Would you two like a little privacy?
Yeah.

666
00:26:46,223 --> 00:26:47,233
No known predators.

667
00:26:47,321 --> 00:26:49,564
That means you have
worse survival instincts

668
00:26:49,652 --> 00:26:51,788
than any other creature
on Earth!

669
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,486
You are dumber than
a turtle!

670
00:26:54,574 --> 00:26:55,798
Y-You are dumber
than a chicken!

671
00:26:55,885 --> 00:26:57,537
You are dumber than
a frog!

672
00:26:58,545 --> 00:27:00,328
- Is he gonna live?
- He'll be fine. <font color=#ffff00>- Yeah.</font> <font color=#80ffff>- Mm-hmm.</font>

673
00:27:00,415 --> 00:27:02,725
You may have to modify
the tux to fit over the cast.

674
00:27:02,813 --> 00:27:04,258
No, there's not gonna be
any kind of tux.

675
00:27:04,345 --> 00:27:06,159
I just needed to know
that he was gonna survive this

676
00:27:06,246 --> 00:27:07,780
so that I wouldn't feel guilty
for leaving him.

677
00:27:07,867 --> 00:27:09,671
Whoa!
Babe, I... come on.

678
00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:11,124
I mean,
they... they dared me.

679
00:27:11,212 --> 00:27:14,194
Last month, my mother
offered me $10,000

680
00:27:14,303 --> 00:27:15,466
to push the wedding back
a year.

681
00:27:15,553 --> 00:27:16,716
One year.

682
00:27:16,983 --> 00:27:18,218
I told her no!

683
00:27:18,306 --> 00:27:19,771
I said it was just
'cause she couldn't see you

684
00:27:19,858 --> 00:27:20,804
for who you are.

685
00:27:20,892 --> 00:27:21,874
But it turns out
it was me.

686
00:27:21,962 --> 00:27:23,366
I couldn't see you
for who you are

687
00:27:23,454 --> 00:27:25,257
because the sex is good

688
00:27:25,791 --> 00:27:27,704
and because
you make me laugh.

689
00:27:28,017 --> 00:27:31,788
And I just keep excusing
your unbelievable stupidity.

690
00:27:32,066 --> 00:27:33,849
I keep making excuses
for you.

691
00:27:34,093 --> 00:27:35,116
You about to leave him?

692
00:27:35,204 --> 00:27:36,850
Because I ate a catfish?

693
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:38,310
Damn it.

694
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:39,533
No.

695
00:27:39,683 --> 00:27:41,202
I am leaving you

696
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:44,936
because this is not
the life that I want.

697
00:27:45,068 --> 00:27:48,507
And when someone shows you
who they are over and over,

698
00:27:48,861 --> 00:27:50,274
you're supposed to
believe them.

699
00:27:57,770 --> 00:28:00,766
The CT revealed
no abscess or infection

700
00:28:00,854 --> 00:28:01,722
from the surgery,

701
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:03,347
but there was fluid
around her heart,

702
00:28:03,435 --> 00:28:04,890
which we were able
to remove.

703
00:28:04,978 --> 00:28:06,643
So, she's okay?

704
00:28:06,876 --> 00:28:08,289
She's gonna be okay?

705
00:28:08,377 --> 00:28:09,815
It was
a temporary measure.

706
00:28:09,964 --> 00:28:11,216
Unfortunately...

707
00:28:11,683 --> 00:28:13,456
we still don't know
the cause.

708
00:28:13,544 --> 00:28:14,847
Well, how long
'til you do know?

709
00:28:14,935 --> 00:28:17,180
We're sending the fluid
we aspirated from the heart

710
00:28:17,268 --> 00:28:18,687
to the lab.
We'll also send

711
00:28:18,775 --> 00:28:19,886
new blood cultures.

712
00:28:19,973 --> 00:28:21,072
W-We'll keep looking,

713
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,370
but at this point,
we just don't know.

714
00:28:22,457 --> 00:28:23,371
I-I'm so sorry.

715
00:28:23,459 --> 00:28:25,211
Mommy, Mommy!
Mei Mei!

716
00:28:25,299 --> 00:28:27,832
Oh, no, no, no, no! You can't go in there!
Hey, hey! Come back!

717
00:28:28,263 --> 00:28:30,096
Mommy, I want to go home.
Let's go home.

718
00:28:30,183 --> 00:28:31,806
Okay,
back away from her, Mei Li.

719
00:28:31,893 --> 00:28:33,773
- I'm sorry. We can't risk infection.
- Hey.

720
00:28:34,512 --> 00:28:36,373
Sweet girl, look at me.

721
00:28:37,205 --> 00:28:38,661
Look at me.

722
00:28:38,984 --> 00:28:40,443
I'm here.

723
00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:43,193
I'm alive.
I'm not dying.

724
00:28:44,826 --> 00:28:47,056
I'm not sick
like Daddy was sick.

725
00:28:47,545 --> 00:28:50,029
And these doctors...

726
00:28:51,248 --> 00:28:52,498
Oh, baby girl,

727
00:28:52,647 --> 00:28:55,197
these doctors...
They are the best.

728
00:28:56,669 --> 00:28:58,131
They're the smartest.

729
00:28:59,499 --> 00:29:01,042
They're gonna
figure this out.

730
00:29:01,223 --> 00:29:03,357
<i>♪ It's walking out on a wire ♪</i>

731
00:29:03,445 --> 00:29:04,920
Right?

732
00:29:07,037 --> 00:29:08,950
- Thanks.
- I'm sorry.

733
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:10,420
Right?

734
00:29:11,436 --> 00:29:13,150
Are you gonna figure this out?

735
00:29:13,237 --> 00:29:16,230
<i>♪ It can turn ya into a fool,
it can feel so cruel ♪</i>

736
00:29:16,318 --> 00:29:17,287
Oh, boy.

737
00:29:17,375 --> 00:29:18,764
You guys have been through
so much already.

738
00:29:18,851 --> 00:29:20,224
I can see that.

739
00:29:20,312 --> 00:29:21,662
Uh, and...
and yes.

740
00:29:22,755 --> 00:29:25,068
We are going to
figure this out.

741
00:29:25,156 --> 00:29:26,902
Put every brain on this
you can find.

742
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:27,998
Create a war room.

743
00:29:28,086 --> 00:29:30,119
We're not letting
that mother die. You hear me?

744
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:31,410
I'm on it.

745
00:29:31,553 --> 00:29:33,426
<i>♪ It can give you hell ♪</i>

746
00:29:33,513 --> 00:29:36,596
<i>♪ Or pull ya through it ♪</i>

747
00:29:36,683 --> 00:29:39,676
<i>♪ Yeah, hope may disappoint us ♪</i>

748
00:29:39,763 --> 00:29:43,846
<i>♪ But we hold on anyway ♪</i>

749
00:29:43,933 --> 00:29:44,926
What is this?

750
00:29:45,013 --> 00:29:46,556
It's called food.

751
00:29:46,643 --> 00:29:49,256
Let's see what it's like
to actually eat some.

752
00:29:49,344 --> 00:29:51,007
How did you even
get in here?

753
00:29:51,221 --> 00:29:53,826
You know, you all should
really move that spare key

754
00:29:53,914 --> 00:29:55,310
to under
a more convenient rock.

755
00:29:55,398 --> 00:29:56,998
I nearly
threw my back out.

756
00:29:57,593 --> 00:29:58,886
Please.

757
00:29:59,115 --> 00:30:00,576
Please, just...

758
00:30:00,664 --> 00:30:02,896
just yell,
just be mad at me.

759
00:30:05,763 --> 00:30:07,056
Okay, I liked her.

760
00:30:07,183 --> 00:30:09,466
I-I-I really loved
the idea

761
00:30:09,553 --> 00:30:11,306
of finally having
one of those big families

762
00:30:11,393 --> 00:30:13,543
like I saw all my friends
growing up with

763
00:30:13,631 --> 00:30:14,381
when I was a kid,

764
00:30:14,469 --> 00:30:17,595
and I only got her for one day,
and then she was gone.

765
00:30:17,683 --> 00:30:18,982
But you...

766
00:30:20,223 --> 00:30:22,326
you lost your niece.

767
00:30:22,513 --> 00:30:24,216
And probably your brother.

768
00:30:24,325 --> 00:30:26,105
I destroyed your family,

769
00:30:26,193 --> 00:30:29,153
and they deserve to sue me
for everything that I've got.

770
00:30:34,348 --> 00:30:36,248
Why don't you
make yourself useful

771
00:30:36,614 --> 00:30:38,912
and open the flour,
would you?

772
00:30:42,643 --> 00:30:43,926
Guess I can see

773
00:30:44,013 --> 00:30:47,412
who I inherited my distaste
for sharing my emotions from.

774
00:30:48,511 --> 00:30:49,794
When, uh...

775
00:30:49,882 --> 00:30:54,037
I was only 10 years old...
when my mother died.

776
00:30:55,886 --> 00:30:58,259
I don't remember much,
you know,

777
00:30:58,409 --> 00:31:01,709
but I remember
I was temperamental sometimes.

778
00:31:01,797 --> 00:31:04,096
A "hot head," she called it.

779
00:31:04,224 --> 00:31:06,959
But she wouldn't send me
to a time-out

780
00:31:07,047 --> 00:31:10,268
or... make me sit and think
about what I've done.

781
00:31:10,379 --> 00:31:11,712
She would go
to the kitchen

782
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:14,063
and she would make us both
some pancakes,

783
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:16,595
and she'd say,
"Let's talk about it

784
00:31:16,683 --> 00:31:18,513
after you've had
something to eat."

785
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:22,471
She didn't get a chance
to teach me much.

786
00:31:23,479 --> 00:31:25,370
But it's a lesson
I'll never forget.

787
00:31:30,456 --> 00:31:31,987
Ah, let's see.

788
00:31:40,737 --> 00:31:43,245
I've been doing it
over and over again.

789
00:31:43,333 --> 00:31:47,556
I've been... going over
every second of Sabi.

790
00:31:48,167 --> 00:31:51,175
I've been replaying in my mind
and just...

791
00:31:51,553 --> 00:31:53,565
wondering what
I could have done

792
00:31:53,925 --> 00:31:56,800
better, smarter...

793
00:31:57,557 --> 00:31:59,628
- faster.
- It's not on you.

794
00:32:00,463 --> 00:32:03,057
Family doesn't operate
on family, Maggie.

795
00:32:03,353 --> 00:32:04,690
I knew better.

796
00:32:04,934 --> 00:32:08,517
I put you in that OR anyway
out of desperation.

797
00:32:08,683 --> 00:32:10,081
I made a mistake.

798
00:32:11,081 --> 00:32:12,506
And now Sabi is dead.

799
00:32:12,593 --> 00:32:14,667
And you'll never
make that mistake again.

800
00:32:15,752 --> 00:32:16,995
That's what you say
to interns

801
00:32:17,083 --> 00:32:19,866
who... who have lost
their first patient, not to...

802
00:32:20,093 --> 00:32:21,682
They're human.

803
00:32:22,456 --> 00:32:24,143
And imperfect.

804
00:32:24,412 --> 00:32:25,912
Like you.

805
00:32:29,973 --> 00:32:32,534
No one has ever
had to tell me that before.

806
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:35,120
Then let Sabi's legacy
be that.

807
00:32:35,208 --> 00:32:37,614
She taught you
what years of school

808
00:32:37,702 --> 00:32:39,064
and residency

809
00:32:39,152 --> 00:32:41,151
and countless hours
never did.

810
00:32:41,556 --> 00:32:44,503
Maggie, you have insurance
for this.

811
00:32:45,011 --> 00:32:46,401
They'll settle with Chris.

812
00:32:46,536 --> 00:32:48,081
It won't bring Sabi back,

813
00:32:48,287 --> 00:32:52,659
but he'll feel like
he's got some justice for her.

814
00:32:53,369 --> 00:32:54,893
And he needs that.

815
00:32:55,839 --> 00:32:58,466
Every surgeon I know
goes through this.

816
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:00,965
And if you quit now,
you'll be quitting

817
00:33:01,053 --> 00:33:03,756
on all those lives
that only you can save.

818
00:33:04,085 --> 00:33:06,271
And I know
Sabi wouldn't want that.

819
00:33:10,591 --> 00:33:12,504
I wish I could've had
more time with her.

820
00:33:12,592 --> 00:33:15,693
Well, ask me
anything you want about her.

821
00:33:15,917 --> 00:33:17,701
No. Richard,
I am not gonna make you...

822
00:33:17,789 --> 00:33:20,099
No, you know, truth be told,
talking about her

823
00:33:20,187 --> 00:33:22,140
is about the only thing
I want to do right now.

824
00:33:30,013 --> 00:33:31,266
Okay,
you don't have to stay

825
00:33:31,353 --> 00:33:32,920
if you need
to check in downstairs.

826
00:33:33,246 --> 00:33:34,990
No, I'm staying.
I feel awful.

827
00:33:35,545 --> 00:33:37,238
Listen, we know
where the ring is, Teddy,

828
00:33:37,326 --> 00:33:38,676
and it's not
perforating anything.

829
00:33:38,763 --> 00:33:39,928
He's gonna be fine.

830
00:33:40,016 --> 00:33:41,600
I mean, kids do
this kind of stuff, you know?

831
00:33:41,687 --> 00:33:43,430
We see cases like this
all the time.

832
00:33:43,518 --> 00:33:45,555
I know, Owen,
but I feel awful.

833
00:33:45,643 --> 00:33:49,346
I mean, your grandmother
and your mom all wore the ring,

834
00:33:49,433 --> 00:33:51,386
and it's survived
in your family for years,

835
00:33:51,473 --> 00:33:52,842
through wars
and depressions,

836
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:54,990
and I couldn't even
keep it for a week.

837
00:33:55,078 --> 00:33:57,201
'Cause you're tired
and overworked, you know?

838
00:33:57,393 --> 00:33:58,920
Could have been
a lot worse.

839
00:33:59,091 --> 00:34:00,885
You know, at least you didn't
leave it inside a patient.

840
00:34:00,972 --> 00:34:02,755
Yeah, well,
now it's inside our child.

841
00:34:04,642 --> 00:34:07,756
Teddy, I shouldn't have given
you the ring in the first place.

842
00:34:07,853 --> 00:34:09,287
You're a trauma surgeon.

843
00:34:09,383 --> 00:34:11,716
No, but I-I want
to wear the ring.

844
00:34:11,804 --> 00:34:13,097
I love the ring.

845
00:34:13,185 --> 00:34:14,185
And...

846
00:34:14,299 --> 00:34:16,131
And I-I love you.

847
00:34:18,553 --> 00:34:19,943
Okay.

848
00:34:20,031 --> 00:34:21,195
- You have a necklace.
- Mm-hmm.

849
00:34:21,282 --> 00:34:23,945
And you have an A for Allison
and an I for Leo.

850
00:34:24,033 --> 00:34:26,201
How about
we add a T and an O

851
00:34:26,334 --> 00:34:29,107
and you can wear your entire
family around your neck?

852
00:34:29,489 --> 00:34:30,496
Okay?

853
00:34:30,823 --> 00:34:33,146
And we're gonna
keep that ring in a safe

854
00:34:33,234 --> 00:34:35,232
for special occasions,
okay?

855
00:34:36,175 --> 00:34:38,287
I have never
loved you more.

856
00:34:44,247 --> 00:34:45,345
Do you smell that?

857
00:34:45,433 --> 00:34:46,593
Mm-hmm.

858
00:34:48,411 --> 00:34:49,661
Okay.

859
00:34:51,473 --> 00:34:52,506
Rock...

860
00:34:52,593 --> 00:34:54,506
You know what? I got it.
This one's on me.

861
00:34:54,834 --> 00:34:56,404
- You sure?
- Mm-hmm.

862
00:34:56,492 --> 00:34:58,615
- 'Cause it's...
- I know. Go.

863
00:34:58,703 --> 00:35:00,306
Let's do this.

864
00:35:07,508 --> 00:35:09,406
Kai's condition
was too advanced

865
00:35:09,494 --> 00:35:11,224
to successfully coil
the bleeding vessel,

866
00:35:11,348 --> 00:35:14,308
so we had to open him up,
do the partial lung resection.

867
00:35:16,315 --> 00:35:18,058
It's going to be
a difficult recovery.

868
00:35:18,364 --> 00:35:19,912
In time, he will
be able to swim,

869
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,678
but not competitively,
I'm afraid.

870
00:35:23,762 --> 00:35:25,193
That stuff...

871
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,923
It's flavored
like French toast, right?

872
00:35:28,185 --> 00:35:29,306
Mm-hmm.

873
00:35:29,393 --> 00:35:31,592
I always smell
French toast.

874
00:35:32,162 --> 00:35:34,005
I feel like an idiot
I didn't know.

875
00:35:34,093 --> 00:35:35,443
They're targeting kids.

876
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:39,676
It's flavored like cotton candy
and bubble gum, as well.

877
00:35:40,037 --> 00:35:41,506
You're not an idiot.

878
00:35:41,857 --> 00:35:43,143
They're evil.

879
00:35:46,104 --> 00:35:48,310
Thank you
for saving my son.

880
00:35:55,012 --> 00:35:56,865
Don't worry.
I won't rub it in.

881
00:35:57,418 --> 00:35:58,623
I'm sorry.

882
00:35:59,976 --> 00:36:02,479
Listen, when I was
on the other side of this,

883
00:36:02,567 --> 00:36:03,980
Yang drove me mad.

884
00:36:04,068 --> 00:36:07,217
She'd leave me notes all over
the place every day for months.

885
00:36:07,305 --> 00:36:08,834
"I was right.
You were wrong."

886
00:36:09,018 --> 00:36:11,092
Little pictures
of resected lungs.

887
00:36:11,513 --> 00:36:12,933
Well,
sounds about right.

888
00:36:14,396 --> 00:36:15,732
Wait, you know her?

889
00:36:17,652 --> 00:36:18,928
I, um...

890
00:36:19,016 --> 00:36:20,107
W...

891
00:36:20,381 --> 00:36:22,529
Um... I gotta go.

892
00:36:22,617 --> 00:36:25,670
<i>Most patients put off
facing the truth as long as possible.</i>

893
00:36:26,068 --> 00:36:27,201
<i>And we get it.</i>

894
00:36:27,321 --> 00:36:28,644
<i>We do it, too.</i>

895
00:36:28,919 --> 00:36:30,232
<i>We ignore things.</i>

896
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,717
<i>We stay under the covers.</i>

897
00:36:31,894 --> 00:36:33,435
<i>We don't pick up
the phone.</i>

898
00:36:33,719 --> 00:36:36,372
Ah. I thought you'd have
some work to catch up on.

899
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:38,263
You... You probably need
to do some unpacking,

900
00:36:38,351 --> 00:36:40,490
shake the sand out from
the beach, do some laundry...

901
00:36:40,643 --> 00:36:42,560
I wasn't on vacation,
Tom.

902
00:36:42,693 --> 00:36:44,928
I sat in my house
for three days.

903
00:36:45,016 --> 00:36:47,505
I didn't get out of bed,
I drank chamomile tea,

904
00:36:47,593 --> 00:36:51,056
and I cried my eyes out
because I had a miscarriage.

905
00:36:51,467 --> 00:36:54,386
That happened,
I'm sad about it,

906
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,769
and I'm taking care
of myself.

907
00:36:55,857 --> 00:36:56,894
Any questions?

908
00:36:56,982 --> 00:36:59,053
- You could have told me.
- I just did.

909
00:36:59,796 --> 00:37:01,049
W... Light a candle.

910
00:37:01,506 --> 00:37:02,576
What?

911
00:37:02,751 --> 00:37:05,204
When my wife...
Uh, my ex-wife, uh, Dana...

912
00:37:05,299 --> 00:37:08,372
She miscarried twice
before we had David.

913
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:12,173
Once at 10 weeks,
once at 18, which was...

914
00:37:12,353 --> 00:37:14,428
Well, I mean, you know...
You know how it was.

915
00:37:14,516 --> 00:37:16,839
I mean, people have
this idea that, uh...

916
00:37:17,076 --> 00:37:18,123
you just get over it,

917
00:37:18,211 --> 00:37:21,874
that, uh, you know,
you're sad and you move on.

918
00:37:21,962 --> 00:37:25,473
But... that wasn't
my experience.

919
00:37:25,784 --> 00:37:27,949
Wasn't
my wife's experience.

920
00:37:28,113 --> 00:37:29,957
So every year, still,

921
00:37:30,183 --> 00:37:32,528
uh, on what would be
their birthdays,

922
00:37:32,699 --> 00:37:35,856
I, uh,
I light a candle.

923
00:37:36,269 --> 00:37:40,176
They took with them
little pieces of our... hearts,

924
00:37:40,598 --> 00:37:42,746
and those pieces
will never be...

925
00:37:43,472 --> 00:37:45,035
replaced.

926
00:37:46,708 --> 00:37:48,621
So, maybe, uh...

927
00:37:49,257 --> 00:37:50,582
light a candle.

928
00:37:52,574 --> 00:37:53,947
Yeah.

929
00:38:01,643 --> 00:38:04,567

931
00:38:08,458 --> 00:38:11,113
You paged me
to the plant room.

932
00:38:13,013 --> 00:38:14,466
Never a good sign.

933
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:19,770
When someone shows you
who they are,

934
00:38:19,858 --> 00:38:21,434
you're supposed to
believe them.

935
00:38:23,371 --> 00:38:26,348
Someone said that today,
and it... it kinda hit me.

936
00:38:28,933 --> 00:38:31,096
We're doctors.

937
00:38:31,183 --> 00:38:32,972
There are tests.

938
00:38:33,667 --> 00:38:36,636
If there was a question
who the father was,

939
00:38:36,755 --> 00:38:39,048
I should have known that
from the beginning.

940
00:38:39,347 --> 00:38:40,550
You're right.

941
00:38:40,836 --> 00:38:42,948
I'm not always...

942
00:38:43,856 --> 00:38:45,106
measured.

943
00:38:45,871 --> 00:38:49,417
I'm not ever
measured.

944
00:38:51,367 --> 00:38:53,167
I'm a little bit chaotic.

945
00:38:54,033 --> 00:38:55,885
I fly
by the seat of my pants,

946
00:38:55,973 --> 00:38:58,716
and I... don't think things
all the way through,

947
00:38:58,803 --> 00:39:00,652
and...

948
00:39:01,378 --> 00:39:03,293
..sometimes
that hurts people.

949
00:39:05,534 --> 00:39:07,394
I'm sorry
that I hurt you.

00:39:15,723 --> 00:39:17,473

953
00:39:20,391 --> 00:39:22,160

00:39:30,385 --> 00:39:32,308
that you're not
the father?

957
00:39:33,393 --> 00:39:36,574
I want to be the guy that says,
uh, it doesn't matter,

958
00:39:36,763 --> 00:39:38,192
but I don't know yet.

959
00:39:38,754 --> 00:39:40,606
I don't know
how much it matters.

960
00:39:41,213 --> 00:39:43,622

I-I think we should...

961
00:39:44,776 --> 00:39:47,689
take it
one step at a time.

962

966
00:40:07,374 --> 00:40:08,377
Hey.

967
00:40:08,465 --> 00:40:09,805
Have the hard conversation.

968
00:40:09,893 --> 00:40:10,966
I got your text.

969
00:40:11,053 --> 00:40:12,636
Say what you mean.

970
00:40:12,723 --> 00:40:14,176
Hey, maybe
we should go to dinner

971
00:40:14,263 --> 00:40:15,459
and clear your head
a little bit.

972
00:40:15,546 --> 00:40:18,106
Her name's Suzanne,
she's got two young kids,

973
00:40:18,194 --> 00:40:20,357
she's a single mom,
and I think she's dying.

974
00:40:20,553 --> 00:40:22,122
Okay.
Are these from today?

975
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:23,363
Yeah,
she crashed on me.

976
00:40:23,577 --> 00:40:26,370
I had to aspirate
a cardiac tamponade... in CT.

977
00:40:26,473 --> 00:40:27,544
I don't get it.

978
00:40:27,632 --> 00:40:29,255
It was a simple appy,
a no-brainer case,

979
00:40:29,343 --> 00:40:31,546
and... and now,
I mean, look at all this.

980
00:40:31,763 --> 00:40:33,559
She's...
She's getting worse.

981
00:40:33,647 --> 00:40:35,361
And I don't know why
or how to help her.

982
00:40:35,449 --> 00:40:38,431
Hey.
Andrew, look at me.

983
00:40:38,712 --> 00:40:40,853
Walk me through it.
From the beginning.

984
00:40:41,033 --> 00:40:42,744
- Good or bad...
- Okay.

985
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:45,305
..you may be surprised
at what you find.

986
00:40:45,393 --> 00:40:46,636
You're right. Okay.

987
00:40:46,723 --> 00:40:48,716

day three...

Uh, uneventful.

994
00:41:28,231 --> 00:41:31,804
Dr. Wells from Pac-North called,
looking for you.

995
00:41:31,892 --> 00:41:34,228
Said you didn't go to work.

996
00:41:34,466 --> 00:41:35,799
I didn't.

997
00:41:35,973 --> 00:41:39,705

Maggie to go back to work.

998
00:41:40,263 --> 00:41:42,165
