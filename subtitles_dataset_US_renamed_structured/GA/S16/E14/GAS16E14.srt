I know you said
no medicine, but...

41
00:01:40,742 --> 00:01:42,962
I will speak
with Dr. Riley.

42
00:01:45,947 --> 00:01:47,378
Do you mind calling pathology

00:01:53,704 --> 00:01:54,737
We're studying them.

47
00:01:54,876 --> 00:01:56,220
Okay,
but she's suffering.

send a doctor to check in on you?

57
00:02:50,204 --> 00:02:51,525
An OB?

00:02:51,829 --> 00:02:53,525

No.
But thank you.

Amelia.

61
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:03,212
Maggie.

62
00:03:04,336 --> 00:03:06,837
Pretty recently,
you were going through something.

63
00:03:08,131 --> 00:03:10,157
And you hid
in your room,

64
00:03:10,697 --> 00:03:13,978
and you rejected
both food and company.

65
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:16,806
And we wanted to bury you
in love all day, every day,

66
00:03:16,902 --> 00:03:18,876
but you locked the door
and...

67
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:24,892
And we grudgingly respected
your desire for privacy.

68
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,859
I appreciated that.

69
00:03:28,184 --> 00:03:29,434
I needed it.

70
00:03:31,279 --> 00:03:32,322
Fine.

71
00:03:32,475 --> 00:03:33,923
Eat the toast...

72
00:03:35,076 --> 00:03:36,673
and I'll spare you
the comfort.

73
00:03:44,532 --> 00:03:46,167
Still haven't found
the perfect apartment?

74
00:03:46,251 --> 00:03:47,806
I've given up
on perfect.

75
00:03:47,891 --> 00:03:51,103
Now I'm just hoping for
four walls and a floor.

76
00:03:51,865 --> 00:03:54,493
Unless you've reconsidered
letting me just stay with you.

77
00:03:55,189 --> 00:03:56,743
I thought
we were past that.

78
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:59,799
Right. We are. So I'm looking
at something tonight.

79
00:03:59,884 --> 00:04:01,127
- You want to come?
- Tonight?

80
00:04:01,212 --> 00:04:02,923
Uh, I can't, sorry.

81
00:04:03,032 --> 00:04:04,695
You can't
because you think I'm needy

82
00:04:04,779 --> 00:04:07,049
- and you're secretly over me or...
- No.

83
00:04:07,134 --> 00:04:10,439
Um, my... my parents
are in town, actually.

84
00:04:10,634 --> 00:04:11,845
Oh.

85
00:04:12,204 --> 00:04:13,579
Finally
get to meet 'em.

86
00:04:13,664 --> 00:04:15,556
Uh, no,
you do not want that.

87
00:04:15,649 --> 00:04:18,634
They're super critical and have
impossibly high standards.

88
00:04:18,845 --> 00:04:21,071
But good luck
on that apartment.

89
00:04:24,956 --> 00:04:27,190
Schmitt.
Plan on doing any work today,

90
00:04:27,275 --> 00:04:28,524
or are you just gonna
stand and stare?

91
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:31,594
Morning, Joey.

92
00:04:32,006 --> 00:04:33,792
Ready to do some PT?

93
00:04:33,939 --> 00:04:34,985
Again?

94
00:04:35,069 --> 00:04:36,884
Every eight hours.

95
00:04:37,414 --> 00:04:38,446
Okay.

96
00:04:38,531 --> 00:04:39,633
Let's check
your range of motion.

97
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,634
Okay.

98
00:04:46,914 --> 00:04:49,978
Abduction's to 45 degrees,
same as last two days.

99
00:04:51,134 --> 00:04:52,774
I'm not really
feeling this.

100
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:53,945
Could we just
try again tomorrow?

101
00:04:54,029 --> 00:04:55,378
Joey, if you don't do
your PT every day,

102
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:57,615
you might never
regain your mobility.

103
00:04:57,891 --> 00:04:59,150
Okay,
that's enough for today.

104
00:04:59,235 --> 00:05:01,142
We'll be back
to check on you later, Joey.

105
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:02,798
That's it?

106
00:05:03,148 --> 00:05:04,594
He's obviously
feeling discouraged.

107
00:05:04,703 --> 00:05:06,351
So you're just gonna
let him off the hook?

108
00:05:06,436 --> 00:05:09,095
No, we need to find a way
to make it feel less daunting.

109
00:05:12,906 --> 00:05:15,322
Hey.
Anything from Amelia?

110
00:05:15,407 --> 00:05:16,615
No.

111
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:18,134
- Alex?
- No.

112
00:05:18,219 --> 00:05:20,470
There was a bear attack
last night, did you hear?

113
00:05:20,837 --> 00:05:22,485
Avery was out camping,
and this bear just...

114
00:05:22,569 --> 00:05:24,924
Just came out of nowhere
and ripped this guy's nose off

115
00:05:25,009 --> 00:05:26,572
and severed his wife's
brachial artery.

116
00:05:26,657 --> 00:05:28,759
- Whoa.
- Yeah.

117
00:05:29,415 --> 00:05:31,315
But that's not
what this is, right?

118
00:05:31,445 --> 00:05:32,602
What what is?

119
00:05:32,695 --> 00:05:33,721
Amelia? Alex?

120
00:05:33,806 --> 00:05:35,619
- I'm not following.
- Do we have bears, Link,

121
00:05:35,704 --> 00:05:36,615
and not know it?

122
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,338
Are we just
sleeping soundly

123
00:05:38,423 --> 00:05:40,901
and they're gonna jump out of
nowhere and rip our noses off?

124
00:05:40,986 --> 00:05:43,623
Alex is going through something
with his family

125
00:05:43,708 --> 00:05:46,212
that he will tell you about
when he's ready

126
00:05:46,336 --> 00:05:48,298
because he's a good guy
and he loves you.

127
00:05:48,766 --> 00:05:50,562
And you just
got married.

128
00:05:50,724 --> 00:05:52,790
Right. Right.

129
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:54,944
And Amelia
just does this sometimes.

130
00:05:55,029 --> 00:05:56,552
What?

131
00:05:57,001 --> 00:05:58,400
Wait.
What?

132
00:05:58,485 --> 00:06:01,955
Well, she and Owen were once
fighting over having kids,

133
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,579
and then
she just ghosted him

134
00:06:03,664 --> 00:06:05,524
and camped out
at my friend Stephanie's house.

135
00:06:05,609 --> 00:06:07,115
Drove her crazy,
but she couldn't say anything

136
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,931
because Amelia was
her boss, so...

137
00:06:10,388 --> 00:06:11,594
Oh.

138
00:06:11,679 --> 00:06:14,518
Uh, in all fairness, there was
a brain tumor back then

139
00:06:14,603 --> 00:06:15,968
that has since
been removed.

140
00:06:16,249 --> 00:06:17,517
Think the brain tumor's back?

141
00:06:17,602 --> 00:06:19,026
We can hope.

142
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,115
Well, what am I supposed to do?
Just wait it out?

143
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:23,664
Avoid Owen and Teddy?

144
00:06:23,827 --> 00:06:25,930
Lock up your food,
zip up your tent?

145
00:06:26,304 --> 00:06:27,763
Too dark?

146
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:29,141
Never.

147
00:06:31,301 --> 00:06:33,025
<i>Dr. Brandy to the blood bank.</i>

148
00:06:33,109 --> 00:06:35,155
<i>Dr. Brandy to the blood bank.</i>

149
00:06:36,569 --> 00:06:38,452
- Good morning, Dr. Webber!
- Good morning, Dr. Webber!

150
00:06:38,537 --> 00:06:41,123
These doctors
need your help.

151
00:06:41,245 --> 00:06:43,960
They need more training...
Your training.

152
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:48,154
- Um... you'll excuse us.
- W...

153
00:06:48,239 --> 00:06:51,155
Is, uh, this you
worrying about me

154
00:06:51,249 --> 00:06:53,390
because my marriage
fell apart?

155
00:06:53,609 --> 00:06:54,855
Richard Webber.

156
00:06:54,939 --> 00:06:58,281
You have a gift
for spotting emerging talent

157
00:06:58,366 --> 00:07:00,390
and guiding them
to excellence,

158
00:07:00,475 --> 00:07:02,981
and, yes, your marriage
fell apart, and...

159
00:07:03,066 --> 00:07:05,352
of course I'm worried
about you, Richard.

160
00:07:06,918 --> 00:07:09,530
I'm fine.
But thank you.

161
00:07:09,653 --> 00:07:10,968
Okay.

162
00:07:11,335 --> 00:07:12,498
But if you need to come by

163
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:14,499
- for dinner this week...
- Alright, let's go!

164
00:07:21,327 --> 00:07:22,780
Scott Burke,
admitted last night

165
00:07:22,865 --> 00:07:24,451
for multiple
chest lacerations,

166
00:07:24,536 --> 00:07:25,822
left hemothorax,

167
00:07:25,923 --> 00:07:28,227
and deep soft-tissue injuries
to the face

168
00:07:28,312 --> 00:07:29,405
from a bear attack.

169
00:07:29,489 --> 00:07:30,775
Don't sugarcoat it.

170
00:07:31,006 --> 00:07:32,765
Damn animal
took off my nose.

171
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:35,445
- And we put it into your arm.
- Alright, Scott.

172
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:36,775
Ready to
take a look?

173
00:07:38,382 --> 00:07:39,625
Thing of beauty.

174
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:40,945
Oh.

175
00:07:41,718 --> 00:07:44,405
So, it's just gonna
sit there?

176
00:07:44,528 --> 00:07:45,781
For how long?

177
00:07:45,866 --> 00:07:47,992
Well, we need your facial wounds
to heal first

178
00:07:48,077 --> 00:07:49,102
before we can
reattach it.

179
00:07:49,187 --> 00:07:50,195
Got really good
blood flow

180
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:52,405
coming in
from your radial artery here.

181
00:07:52,489 --> 00:07:54,945
And that'll keep it viable
until we're ready to reattach.

182
00:07:55,029 --> 00:07:58,288
And...
my wife, Rachel?

183
00:07:59,226 --> 00:08:00,624
Can I see her?

184
00:08:00,816 --> 00:08:02,932
Okay, can you squeeze
my fingers?

185
00:08:03,329 --> 00:08:06,205
Okay, she still has weakness
in median nerve distribution.

186
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:07,523
Okay, Rachel.

187
00:08:07,608 --> 00:08:09,604
We repaired the artery
last night,

188
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:12,812
but today we need to do a
washout to prevent infection, okay?

189
00:08:13,589 --> 00:08:17,335
We, uh...
We had j-just woken up,

190
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:20,398
and Scott was gonna make
some coffee.

191
00:08:20,484 --> 00:08:24,702
And out of nowhere,
there was a-a-a bear.

192
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:27,376
A h-huge bear.

193
00:08:27,609 --> 00:08:29,710
And S-Scott
jumped in front of me,

194
00:08:30,054 --> 00:08:31,593
tried to protect me.

195
00:08:31,779 --> 00:08:33,820
He jumped in front of
a bear for me.

196
00:08:33,905 --> 00:08:35,976
- Yeah.
- And the good news is

197
00:08:36,061 --> 00:08:37,156
we found his nose

198
00:08:37,241 --> 00:08:38,617
and we were able
to salvage it, okay?

199
00:08:39,795 --> 00:08:42,155
Do you want us
to take you to see him?

200
00:08:42,876 --> 00:08:44,140
Rach?

201
00:08:44,687 --> 00:08:46,843
Oh, my God.
You scared the hell out of me.

202
00:08:49,334 --> 00:08:50,765
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

203
00:08:51,045 --> 00:08:52,211
I love you.

204
00:08:52,296 --> 00:08:53,609
I love you so much,
baby.

205
00:08:53,694 --> 00:08:54,796
Oh, God.

206
00:08:57,569 --> 00:08:58,827
Nurse Karen.

207
00:08:59,068 --> 00:09:01,359
Do you have any idea where
the video-game cart might be?

208
00:09:01,444 --> 00:09:03,625
I have a patient
who doesn't want to do his PT,

209
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:04,735
and I think
it might help.

210
00:09:04,819 --> 00:09:06,507
- Let me look.
- Thank you.

211
00:09:09,278 --> 00:09:11,267
Did you have any idea
you'd be in the arcade business

212
00:09:11,351 --> 00:09:12,414
when you took up peds?

213
00:09:12,499 --> 00:09:14,110
I'd be a lot more popular
with my kids if I was.

214
00:09:14,194 --> 00:09:15,875
All they want to do
is play video games.

215
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,360
I think I might just see
the top of their heads

216
00:09:17,452 --> 00:09:18,554
until they're
25.

217
00:09:18,921 --> 00:09:20,235
What are you guys working on?

218
00:09:20,319 --> 00:09:23,625
We are organizing
a pro bono surgery day

219
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:25,383
for people
who can't afford insurance.

220
00:09:25,468 --> 00:09:26,835
Ah. Good.

221
00:09:27,163 --> 00:09:30,855
Uh, there's a-a game room
on the fourth floor.

222
00:09:30,939 --> 00:09:32,328
What, like a whole room
just for PT?

223
00:09:32,412 --> 00:09:33,702
Well, it's not

224
00:09:33,787 --> 00:09:34,967
- exactly just a room for that...
- Uh, hey, hey, do you remember,

225
00:09:35,051 --> 00:09:37,077
uh, a Fred... uh, sorry,
Frank... Fred Mercer?

226
00:09:37,162 --> 00:09:39,063
You did a lap appy on him
two years ago.

227
00:09:39,148 --> 00:09:40,000
You remember that?

228
00:09:40,085 --> 00:09:41,610
Kind of in the middle
of a conversation here, bud.

229
00:09:41,694 --> 00:09:43,524
<i>Speaking Italian...</i>

230
00:09:43,609 --> 00:09:45,913
<i>Speaking Italian...</i>

231
00:09:45,998 --> 00:09:47,598
- You speak Italian?
- You speak Italian?

232
00:09:48,919 --> 00:09:50,780
- Fourth floor, you said?
- Yeah, it's, um...

233
00:09:50,865 --> 00:09:52,649
It's in between the blue
and the green room.

234
00:09:52,734 --> 00:09:53,609
- Okay. Thank you.
- Yeah.

235
00:09:53,694 --> 00:09:56,115
And, uh, count me in for that
pro bono surgery day, okay?

236
00:09:56,199 --> 00:09:56,767
- Yes!
- Hey,

237
00:09:56,851 --> 00:09:57,945
- a Fred Mercer, okay? Stay with me.
- Put him down. Yes.

238
00:09:58,029 --> 00:09:59,931
I was going through some of the
transcripts from a lecture that you gave.

239
00:10:00,015 --> 00:10:01,525
You said he had
post-op rashes

240
00:10:01,609 --> 00:10:02,780
and electrolyte
abnormalities.

241
00:10:02,865 --> 00:10:05,141
Now, I need to know if his
appendix had a carcinoid tumor

242
00:10:05,226 --> 00:10:07,553
because he already shares two
symptoms with Suzanne Britland,

243
00:10:07,637 --> 00:10:09,483
so I'm thinking maybe she's got
a carcinoid tumor

244
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:10,997
and, you know,
we just can't see it.

245
00:10:11,155 --> 00:10:12,520
Okay.

246
00:10:12,765 --> 00:10:15,137
You've been going through
transcripts of my old lectures?

247
00:10:15,222 --> 00:10:17,827
Well, yeah, I'm going through
transcripts from everyone's lectures.

248
00:10:17,911 --> 00:10:19,855
When's the last time
you slept, Andrew?

249
00:10:19,939 --> 00:10:21,232
What's that have to do
with anything?

250
00:10:21,316 --> 00:10:23,473
You can't help Suzanne
if you're exhausted.

251
00:10:23,779 --> 00:10:26,060
You took Suzanne off the meds
three days ago.

252
00:10:26,145 --> 00:10:27,315
- Mm-hmm.
- Have you taken a break?

253
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:30,290
Look, c-can you just...
answer the question, please?

254
00:10:32,034 --> 00:10:34,820
I think the rash
was, um,

255
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:37,065
propofol-infusion syndrome.

256
00:10:37,149 --> 00:10:38,315
- Propofol infus...
- Okay.

257
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:39,815
You could try to run
a CgA.

258
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:41,735
Thank you.
It didn't need to be that hard.

259
00:10:41,821 --> 00:10:44,431
DeLuca, the pericardial biopsy

260
00:10:44,516 --> 00:10:46,712
came back negative
for carcinomatosis.

261
00:10:46,797 --> 00:10:48,197
Okay.
Thank you.

262
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:49,845
Excuse me.

263
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:51,774
Is there any progress?

264
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,305
Everything I rule out
is progress.

265
00:10:54,439 --> 00:10:55,985
Are you working
in shifts?

266
00:10:56,069 --> 00:10:57,852
Because he seems
pretty fried.

267
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:01,155
By the time I brought
someone else up to speed,

268
00:11:01,239 --> 00:11:03,922
Suzanne could be dead,
and DeLuca, he's a machine.

269
00:11:04,024 --> 00:11:06,977
He isn't a machine.
He's a resident.

270
00:11:07,092 --> 00:11:08,604
And he seems like
he could use a break.

271
00:11:08,688 --> 00:11:09,915
He's obsessing.

272
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,946
I'm relying on that,

273
00:11:12,461 --> 00:11:15,727
and Suzanne's life
may depend on it.

274
00:11:24,655 --> 00:11:26,114
Hi, there.
I called in sick.

275
00:11:26,199 --> 00:11:27,144
What?

276
00:11:27,589 --> 00:11:29,106
I thought we had a deal.

277
00:11:29,191 --> 00:11:30,442
I'm backing out
of our deal.

278
00:11:30,526 --> 00:11:33,082
See,
I appreciated the space

279
00:11:33,167 --> 00:11:35,293
because I grew up
an only child

280
00:11:35,378 --> 00:11:37,910
and I am better
at solving problems on my own,

281
00:11:37,995 --> 00:11:40,701
but you grew up
in a wolf pack,

282
00:11:40,816 --> 00:11:42,317
and wolves
only retreat from the pack

283
00:11:42,402 --> 00:11:44,282
when they are
going off alone to die.

284
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:46,761
So, I'm backing out
of our deal.

285
00:11:57,609 --> 00:11:59,022
Well, the only way
I've ever seen you

286
00:11:59,106 --> 00:12:00,714
get yourself out of
a really deep spiral

287
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:03,971
is to spiral out loud
until you land on something

288
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:06,704
that is healthier than whatever
is happening inside your head.

289
00:12:11,533 --> 00:12:15,157
For an only child,
you are an excellent sister.

290
00:12:21,485 --> 00:12:22,612
Hi!

291
00:12:23,532 --> 00:12:26,902
Your, uh,
husband wants to see you.

292
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:29,232
I-I sh...
I should go, right?

293
00:12:29,316 --> 00:12:31,017
I mean, I-I go?

294
00:12:31,689 --> 00:12:33,066
He jumped in front of
a bear for me.

295
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:34,782
Babe.

296
00:12:34,969 --> 00:12:36,331
You have to tell him
sooner or later.

297
00:12:36,415 --> 00:12:38,192
Oh, God.
Helm.

298
00:12:38,276 --> 00:12:39,982
I-I love him,
o-okay?

299
00:12:40,066 --> 00:12:42,782
He's... He's my husband,
and I-I love him,

300
00:12:42,866 --> 00:12:45,790
but I'm not in...
In love with him anymore.

301
00:12:45,923 --> 00:12:47,884
I'm... I'm in love
with Brian and...

302
00:12:49,094 --> 00:12:50,643
We went
to high school together.

303
00:12:50,735 --> 00:12:52,219
Uh...

304
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,942
We reconnected online,

305
00:12:54,026 --> 00:12:56,322
and, well,
one thing led to another.

306
00:12:56,406 --> 00:12:57,482
I was gonna tell Scott

307
00:12:57,566 --> 00:12:59,665
on the... on the camp...
Camping trip.

308
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,759
I th... I thought
the nature would be c...

309
00:13:02,866 --> 00:13:06,010
be comforting for...
for him, and then...

310
00:13:06,095 --> 00:13:07,782
And then he jumped
in front of a bear for you.

311
00:13:07,866 --> 00:13:09,360
W-What...
What do I do?

312
00:13:09,445 --> 00:13:10,985
I mean, what...
What do I say?

313
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:12,994
Neither one of you needs
any more stress right now,

314
00:13:13,078 --> 00:13:14,971
so we'll just...
We'll let him know

315
00:13:15,056 --> 00:13:16,331
that we're prepping you
for surgery.

316
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:18,087
Helm,
prep her for surgery,

317
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:19,925
and bite your tongue.

318
00:13:23,078 --> 00:13:25,354
We will clean the wound
to help her heal,

319
00:13:25,439 --> 00:13:26,837
but she should be fine.

320
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:29,442
But can I see her
before you take her?

321
00:13:29,526 --> 00:13:31,665
I'll sit in a wheelchair,
I-I-I'll be careful,

322
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:32,862
what... what...
Whatever you want.

323
00:13:32,946 --> 00:13:35,522
I mean, I don't...
I don't see why not.

324
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:37,267
No, I'm... I'm sorry.

325
00:13:37,368 --> 00:13:40,181
The operating rooms
are on a strict schedule today,

326
00:13:40,266 --> 00:13:42,619
um, but we can update you again
when we're done.

327
00:13:45,025 --> 00:13:47,166
You'll tell her
I-I love her?

328
00:13:52,117 --> 00:13:54,751
His wife is in love
with someone else.

329
00:13:55,297 --> 00:13:57,481
Got it.
O-kay.

330
00:13:57,766 --> 00:13:59,232
His wife is in love
with someone else.

331
00:13:59,316 --> 00:14:01,392
I just lied to him
while he has a nose in his arm

332
00:14:01,477 --> 00:14:02,923
because he saved her
from a bear.

333
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:05,884
Alright, well,
sometimes patient care

334
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:08,338
is... is complicated.

335
00:14:11,055 --> 00:14:12,690
Hey,
little bunnies.

336
00:14:13,027 --> 00:14:14,288
- It's Mom.
- Oh, stop.

337
00:14:14,373 --> 00:14:15,721
It's doing something.

338
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:17,821
Alright, well,
we've, uh...

339
00:14:17,906 --> 00:14:18,956
We've ruled out
a lot of bad things,

340
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,126
which is a-a good sign,

341
00:14:20,211 --> 00:14:21,822
but I do need
to draw some more blood

342
00:14:21,907 --> 00:14:22,931
for a few more tests.

343
00:14:23,016 --> 00:14:24,322
Does she have
any left?

344
00:14:24,407 --> 00:14:25,612
Hadley.

345
00:14:25,962 --> 00:14:27,204
Come on.

346
00:14:27,289 --> 00:14:28,981
I barely have enough energy
for this.

347
00:14:29,066 --> 00:14:30,142
Sorry.

348
00:14:30,227 --> 00:14:31,994
Okay, um,
I got it.

349
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:33,152
- Let's do it again.
- Okay.

350
00:14:33,236 --> 00:14:34,354
Okay.

351
00:14:34,438 --> 00:14:36,541
Hey, little bunnies.
It's me.

352
00:14:36,626 --> 00:14:37,868
I'm just checking
to make sure

353
00:14:37,953 --> 00:14:39,603
that you're eating
all your carrots and...

354
00:14:39,688 --> 00:14:41,604
No, wait. It's doing something
to your mouth.

355
00:14:41,689 --> 00:14:43,110
Huh?
What?

356
00:14:43,276 --> 00:14:44,478
Oh, my God.

357
00:14:44,563 --> 00:14:46,416
Oh, my God.
Her mouth is bleeding!

358
00:14:46,501 --> 00:14:48,282
What? What?

359
00:14:48,366 --> 00:14:49,790
Open your mouth
for me, Suzanne.

360
00:14:49,985 --> 00:14:51,478
No, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

361
00:14:51,563 --> 00:14:53,829
What's happening?
I-I'm not sure.

362
00:14:54,165 --> 00:14:55,454
Oh!

363
00:14:55,539 --> 00:14:58,166
Platelet count went from 250 to
5. All of her cell counts are down.

364
00:14:58,250 --> 00:14:59,960
Well, what does it mean?
I just said I don't know, okay?!

365
00:15:00,044 --> 00:15:01,807
I just...
I-I'm sorry.

366
00:15:01,892 --> 00:15:03,337
I'm sorry.

367
00:15:03,422 --> 00:15:05,525
I... C-Can someone page
Dr. Riley, please?

368
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:07,720
We need to prep for
a bone-marrow biopsy right now.

369
00:15:12,392 --> 00:15:14,526
- Can I have her chart?
- Yeah.

370
00:15:15,775 --> 00:15:18,009
Oh.
D-Dr. Grey?

371
00:15:19,831 --> 00:15:21,603
- Hi.
- Hi.

372
00:15:22,285 --> 00:15:24,010
I know you're worried
about him, right?

373
00:15:24,095 --> 00:15:25,790
Yes,
for a long time now.

374
00:15:25,984 --> 00:15:27,151
Yeah.
He's exhausted.

375
00:15:27,236 --> 00:15:28,588
Riley is working him...

376
00:15:28,673 --> 00:15:30,267
Meredith,
I came to Seattle

377
00:15:30,352 --> 00:15:32,908
because Andrew is now
the same age as our father was

378
00:15:32,993 --> 00:15:34,587
- when his symptoms started.
- Ohh.

379
00:15:34,672 --> 00:15:36,853
It... It runs
in the family.

380
00:15:38,563 --> 00:15:40,517
I mean, he's been...
he's been fine.

381
00:15:40,655 --> 00:15:42,907
It's just his patient's
circling the drain,

382
00:15:42,992 --> 00:15:44,228
he can't figure it out,

383
00:15:44,313 --> 00:15:45,731
and we've all
been there.

384
00:15:45,816 --> 00:15:47,509
It's not just
this patient, though.

385
00:15:47,594 --> 00:15:50,315
There have been warning signs...
High highs, low lows.

386
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,947
Do you remember
when Sam left

387
00:15:52,032 --> 00:15:53,525
and he couldn't get off
your sofa?

388
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:55,791
A-And then he went
and threw himself on the fire

389
00:15:55,876 --> 00:15:56,980
in Dr. Webber's
operating room.

390
00:15:57,064 --> 00:15:58,322
He was very low,

391
00:15:58,407 --> 00:15:59,760
and he was suddenly
the opposite.

392
00:15:59,845 --> 00:16:01,439
Well, he does feel things
very deeply.

393
00:16:01,524 --> 00:16:03,821
Failing to understand
or properly consider

394
00:16:03,906 --> 00:16:06,735
the consequences of your actions
is a sign of mania.

395
00:16:06,835 --> 00:16:09,190
He aggressively pursued
a relationship with his boss,

396
00:16:09,275 --> 00:16:10,487
he claimed credit
for your crime,

397
00:16:10,571 --> 00:16:11,821
and then he went...

398
00:16:12,195 --> 00:16:13,501
to jail,
prepared to lose

399
00:16:13,585 --> 00:16:14,868
his medical career.

400
00:16:14,985 --> 00:16:17,650
I mean, we're all a little manic
when we're in love.

401
00:16:17,735 --> 00:16:20,243
Yes, but you don't all have
his family history.

402
00:16:20,339 --> 00:16:22,673
He's not sleeping,
he's not eating.

403
00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:25,424
Okay, so how do you tell
a healthy obsession from mania?

404
00:16:25,509 --> 00:16:26,402
He's a resident,

405
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:28,041
and you're
chief of general surgery.

406
00:16:28,126 --> 00:16:29,495
Would you even think
to ask that question

407
00:16:29,579 --> 00:16:30,751
if you didn't love him?

408
00:16:44,261 --> 00:16:45,544
Bailey,
do you have a second?

409
00:16:47,869 --> 00:16:49,079
You okay?

410
00:16:49,563 --> 00:16:51,263
I'm perimenopausal, Grey.

411
00:16:51,348 --> 00:16:52,514
You know
what that means.

412
00:16:52,599 --> 00:16:53,885
I go to bed freezing,

413
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:56,476
and then I wake up in the middle
of the night broiling.

414
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:58,914
I'm in an all-night battle
with my blanket.

415
00:16:58,998 --> 00:17:00,910
I'm happy, then I'm sad,
I'm laughing,

416
00:17:00,995 --> 00:17:03,535
and then I want to
throw this fan at the wall.

417
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:04,652
Am I okay?

418
00:17:04,737 --> 00:17:07,942
I mean, what, women are
51% of the population,

419
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,230
and every single
one of them

420
00:17:09,315 --> 00:17:11,394
have or will experience
this joy

421
00:17:11,498 --> 00:17:13,294
at some time
in their lives,

422
00:17:13,378 --> 00:17:15,941
so in that sense,
I guess I'm just fine.

423
00:17:16,055 --> 00:17:17,095
Talk.

424
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,050
I'm worried about
our chief resident.

425
00:17:24,558 --> 00:17:26,083
You waiting for me
to put this fan down?

426
00:17:26,167 --> 00:17:27,301
'Cause that's not
gonna happen, Grey.

427
00:17:27,385 --> 00:17:29,681
Sit down.
Tell me more.

428
00:17:29,823 --> 00:17:32,035
Okay, so, you're familiar
with this case.

429
00:17:37,794 --> 00:17:39,170
You're holding it
sideways.

430
00:17:39,255 --> 00:17:40,894
Don't come for me.

431
00:17:40,979 --> 00:17:43,121
The tips of the Maryland
should be pointing down,

432
00:17:43,248 --> 00:17:44,693
right, Dr. Webber?

433
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:47,850
Uh, what's that?

434
00:17:47,935 --> 00:17:49,164
The tip should be
pointing down...

435
00:17:49,248 --> 00:17:50,294
The Maryland dissectors?

436
00:17:50,378 --> 00:17:51,787
Uh, yeah, yeah.

437
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,874
Is this a mind game?

438
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:57,538
Maybe he doesn't like
know-it-alls.

439
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:04,943
Do you get this involved
with every patient?

440
00:18:05,038 --> 00:18:07,147
Most patients
aren't this difficult.

441
00:18:07,232 --> 00:18:09,598
Yeah.
Just the fun ones.

442
00:18:11,878 --> 00:18:15,177
So, are you still
dating your boss?

443
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:19,451
I observe people closely
because I have to

444
00:18:19,538 --> 00:18:21,740
as a doctor and as a person,

445
00:18:21,825 --> 00:18:25,575
and the way people
who have slept together argue

446
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:27,873
is very different
than people who have not.

447
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:31,349
Their bodies have a completely
different language.

448
00:18:31,635 --> 00:18:33,317
We're still dating,
I think.

449
00:18:33,418 --> 00:18:36,124
Hmm.
That would explain her concern.

450
00:18:36,316 --> 00:18:38,138
Concern? What, did she
say something to you?

451
00:18:39,229 --> 00:18:41,935
Just wants to make sure
I don't work you to death.

452
00:18:42,113 --> 00:18:43,573
It was nice.

453
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:49,584
You see, Joey?
It couldn't be easier.

454
00:18:49,668 --> 00:18:51,678
It's exactly like
your PT exercises, so go on.

455
00:18:51,763 --> 00:18:53,004
- Give it a try.
- No, thanks.

456
00:18:53,088 --> 00:18:54,294
- Just try it.
- No.

457
00:18:54,379 --> 00:18:56,912
Joey, you could lose
your ability to use your arm.

458
00:18:56,997 --> 00:18:58,669
I can't play
video games!

459
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:02,503
I'm here
with video games

460
00:19:02,588 --> 00:19:04,414
and people
taking care of me.

461
00:19:04,748 --> 00:19:07,271
I sleep in a warm bed,
and I have no idea

462
00:19:07,356 --> 00:19:09,451
if my little sister
and brothers are okay

463
00:19:09,547 --> 00:19:11,793
or if they're safe
or if they're scared.

464
00:19:12,732 --> 00:19:14,608
Uh, you guys
are all worried about my arm,

465
00:19:14,693 --> 00:19:15,958
but I'm shaking.

466
00:19:16,043 --> 00:19:17,834
Look, I'm so scared for them,
I'm shaking.

467
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:19,874
Why doesn't anyone care
about that?

468
00:19:20,402 --> 00:19:22,138
Why doesn't anyone
try to fix that?

469
00:19:25,966 --> 00:19:27,701
Okay,
more irrigation.

470
00:19:29,298 --> 00:19:31,504
What if you,
uh

471
00:19:31,596 --> 00:19:34,676
Found out
Amelia's baby was yours?

472
00:19:34,761 --> 00:19:36,176
What?

473
00:19:37,029 --> 00:19:38,334
Why would you
say that?

474
00:19:38,418 --> 00:19:40,655
It's...
It's a hypothetical.

475
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:42,818
That's not something
I want to consider.

476
00:19:42,903 --> 00:19:44,153
Why not?

477
00:19:44,238 --> 00:19:46,240
Would it change things
for you and Teddy?

478
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:47,737
Karev,
why are you asking me this?

479
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:50,190
Alex went home to Iowa,

480
00:19:50,275 --> 00:19:51,591
and I've barely
heard from him,

481
00:19:51,676 --> 00:19:53,874
and my worst-case-scenario meter
is off the charts right now

482
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:55,749
because this patient
is cheating on her husband

483
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:58,779
right under his nose,
which is in his arm.

484
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,208
And you think
Alex is...

485
00:20:00,293 --> 00:20:02,451
She reconnected with an ex
from high school,

486
00:20:02,536 --> 00:20:03,820
and then one thing
led to another.

487
00:20:03,904 --> 00:20:05,022
So what if he just

488
00:20:05,107 --> 00:20:07,214
ran into some old girlfriend
from high school

489
00:20:07,298 --> 00:20:08,914
and one thing
led to another?

490
00:20:08,998 --> 00:20:10,268
Okay. Ready to pack.

491
00:20:13,395 --> 00:20:14,731
Jo, it took me
a long, long time

492
00:20:14,816 --> 00:20:16,812
to get to this place in my life
with me and Teddy,

493
00:20:16,959 --> 00:20:18,755
you know,
just like you and Karev.

494
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:21,756
I'm not gonna screw that up
for anything.

495
00:20:22,779 --> 00:20:24,396
And neither is
your husband.

496
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:31,287
Chief, i-if this can wait,
please, I got to...

497
00:20:31,753 --> 00:20:35,209
Dr. DeLuca, all surgeons
occasionally have patients

498
00:20:35,294 --> 00:20:36,381
that get under
their skin.

499
00:20:36,466 --> 00:20:37,396
- What, uh...
- But...

500
00:20:37,481 --> 00:20:38,607
Hmm.
No, no, no.

501
00:20:38,761 --> 00:20:40,333
What did she tell you?

502
00:20:40,748 --> 00:20:42,404
That I'm making mistakes?
Because I'm not.

503
00:20:42,489 --> 00:20:45,045
Uh, Meredith Grey
will be taking over

504
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:46,567
Suzanne Britland's care.

505
00:20:46,652 --> 00:20:50,084
Every test, every treatment
will be approved by her.

506
00:20:50,168 --> 00:20:51,334
She's my patient.

507
00:20:51,418 --> 00:20:53,294
She's the hospital's
patient.

508
00:20:54,224 --> 00:20:55,753
And you need
to get some rest.

509
00:20:55,996 --> 00:20:58,316
So what's your plan,
then? Do you even have one?

510
00:20:59,628 --> 00:21:01,615
I have instructed
Dr. Grey

511
00:21:01,701 --> 00:21:04,185
to put Suzanne Britland
back on her medication

512
00:21:04,299 --> 00:21:06,053
while she continues to
seek a diagnosis. - No, no.

513
00:21:06,137 --> 00:21:07,593
So your plan
is to kill her, then.

514
00:21:07,678 --> 00:21:09,503
Dr. DeLuca,
do I need to remind you

515
00:21:09,588 --> 00:21:10,669
to whom
you are speaking?

516
00:21:10,754 --> 00:21:11,954
Just because
this hasn't worked yet

517
00:21:12,038 --> 00:21:13,504
does not mean
that it won't, okay?

518
00:21:13,588 --> 00:21:14,714
We are on the verge
of something.

519
00:21:14,798 --> 00:21:16,443
I-I know it.
I can feel it. Please.

520
00:21:16,528 --> 00:21:19,333
Meredith Grey is
the chief of general surgery.

521
00:21:19,418 --> 00:21:20,714
You should be grateful

522
00:21:20,798 --> 00:21:22,529
she's taken an interest
in your case.

523
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:23,905
Get some sleep.

524
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:25,568
Dr. Bailey, please.

525
00:21:25,653 --> 00:21:26,991
DeLuca, walk away now

526
00:21:27,076 --> 00:21:28,943
before you say something
you'll regret.

527
00:21:38,619 --> 00:21:39,752
Dr. Bailey.

528
00:21:39,847 --> 00:21:41,450
I've been working
with Joey Phillips.

529
00:21:41,652 --> 00:21:43,934
Oh, let me guess.
He doesn't want to do PT.

530
00:21:44,019 --> 00:21:45,232
How'd you know?

531
00:21:45,317 --> 00:21:47,131
'Cause he doesn't want to do
much of anything.

532
00:21:47,216 --> 00:21:48,671
Yeah, well, the poor kid
was living on the street

533
00:21:48,755 --> 00:21:49,724
before they brought him
in here.

534
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:51,029
I'd like to try
to find a way to help him.

535
00:21:51,113 --> 00:21:52,913
You don't think
I want to help him?

536
00:21:53,049 --> 00:21:55,029
I mean, all I think about is,
you know,

537
00:21:55,114 --> 00:21:56,811
what happens when he's ready
to be discharged?

538
00:21:56,895 --> 00:21:57,812
Then what?

539
00:21:57,897 --> 00:21:59,562
Do we put him back
on the street?

540
00:21:59,647 --> 00:22:01,143
And th... Okay,
and then let's say

541
00:22:01,228 --> 00:22:03,513
he manages to find
a place to live,

542
00:22:03,598 --> 00:22:05,841
finish high school,
go to college.

543
00:22:05,926 --> 00:22:08,755
Well, who visits him
on parents' weekend?

544
00:22:08,888 --> 00:22:10,304
Where does he go
for Thanksgiving?

545
00:22:10,388 --> 00:22:12,644
Who shows up
at his graduation

546
00:22:12,728 --> 00:22:15,193
with embarrassing signs
and a foghorn?

547
00:22:15,302 --> 00:22:16,826
Um...

548
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:20,193
I actually wasn't thinking
that far ahead.

549
00:22:21,325 --> 00:22:23,342
I was thinking more like
how can I help him today.

550
00:22:23,427 --> 00:22:24,951
Sure, uh, oka...
Oh.

551
00:22:25,099 --> 00:22:26,939
H-He'd like to talk
to his brothers and sister.

552
00:22:27,528 --> 00:22:29,201
Do you know
anyone we can call?

553
00:22:34,146 --> 00:22:36,186
So, he's healthy.

554
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:39,404
- And that feels like a miracle.
- Mm.

555
00:22:39,638 --> 00:22:43,412
And, uh, he's already
the size of a cabbage,

556
00:22:43,497 --> 00:22:47,662
uh, which means that I am
further along than I thought.

557
00:22:48,437 --> 00:22:52,638
So, um, the baby
might be Owen's,

558
00:22:52,768 --> 00:22:54,104
not Link's.

559
00:22:54,695 --> 00:22:56,195
Might be, or is?

560
00:22:57,050 --> 00:22:58,217
Might be.

561
00:22:58,302 --> 00:23:00,144
Um, I don't know.

562
00:23:00,228 --> 00:23:03,224
There wasn't
a ton of time

563
00:23:03,308 --> 00:23:05,308
between the breakup
and the hookup.

564
00:23:08,974 --> 00:23:11,068
Link and I
are really good together,

565
00:23:11,341 --> 00:23:15,802
um, like,
almost painfully good.

566
00:23:16,989 --> 00:23:18,455
You know, it felt like

567
00:23:18,562 --> 00:23:21,505
that thing that we'd both earned
in this life.

568
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:26,498
It was accidental
and it was perfect, and...

569
00:23:29,888 --> 00:23:31,304
And now it's not.

570
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:33,787
Because he wants to know
the baby's biology?

571
00:23:33,872 --> 00:23:35,343
Because he's, um,

572
00:23:35,428 --> 00:23:37,701
not sure that he wants
to be with me

573
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:39,920
if the baby isn't his.

574
00:23:41,271 --> 00:23:44,022
And that makes me
not so sure

575
00:23:44,107 --> 00:23:45,496
that I want
to be with him

576
00:23:46,637 --> 00:23:48,521
if the baby is his.

577
00:23:53,214 --> 00:23:55,357
You and Owen have
a complicated relationship.

578
00:23:55,442 --> 00:23:56,433
Mm-hmm.

579
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:57,592
- Yeah. Um,
- Yeah.

580
00:23:57,677 --> 00:23:59,607
That's what he said.

581
00:23:59,872 --> 00:24:01,810
But I want him
to love me enough

582
00:24:01,895 --> 00:24:04,015
that that doesn't matter.

583
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:08,185
I love you more than
my biological sisters.

584
00:24:08,317 --> 00:24:09,990
Biology doesn't matter.

585
00:24:10,688 --> 00:24:12,115
Love matters.

586
00:24:14,146 --> 00:24:15,724
Okay.

587
00:24:15,849 --> 00:24:17,740
And, still,

588
00:24:18,934 --> 00:24:21,607
if I were Link,
I would be terrified.

589
00:24:23,252 --> 00:24:26,099
I would terrified
that the baby is Owen's

590
00:24:26,927 --> 00:24:30,763
and that, if it is,
that connection might reignite

591
00:24:30,848 --> 00:24:33,388
whatever embers still exist
between you and Owen.

592
00:24:33,473 --> 00:24:37,263
If I were Link,
I would want to know, too.

593
00:24:38,664 --> 00:24:40,561
And it wouldn't have
anything to do

594
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:41,998
with how much
I love you.

595
00:24:45,462 --> 00:24:47,865
Okay, but can you stop
pretending that you're Link?

596
00:24:51,098 --> 00:24:53,021
Can you pretend
that you're me for a minute?

597
00:24:54,888 --> 00:24:57,768
Okay.
Okay, okay.

598
00:24:57,978 --> 00:24:59,442
Okay.

599
00:25:00,482 --> 00:25:02,490
Okay,
if I'm you...

600
00:25:04,923 --> 00:25:09,223
..imagine that the hormones
coursing through my body

601
00:25:09,308 --> 00:25:11,177
would be overwhelming.

602
00:25:13,545 --> 00:25:15,412
They might overwhelm
rationality,

603
00:25:15,497 --> 00:25:17,232
and I just might
want to be held...

604
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:24,099
..and, um,
loved no matter what...

605
00:25:26,417 --> 00:25:28,302
..and reassured that
I'm not going to be alone.

606
00:25:31,474 --> 00:25:33,232
Hey,
I love you.

607
00:25:33,341 --> 00:25:35,577
I got you.
I got you.

608
00:25:35,662 --> 00:25:37,684
You're not
gonna be alone.

609
00:25:39,168 --> 00:25:40,709
I love you.

610
00:25:50,926 --> 00:25:52,357
Oh.
Hey, how you doing?

611
00:25:53,478 --> 00:25:54,804
Uh, great.

612
00:25:54,936 --> 00:25:55,982
Yeah. You?

613
00:25:56,079 --> 00:25:57,763
Uh, Teddy's still got
the flu,

614
00:25:57,848 --> 00:26:00,684
so I'm in single-dad mode,
but I can't complain.

615
00:26:00,966 --> 00:26:02,724
Everything okay?
Not freaking out?

616
00:26:03,928 --> 00:26:05,138
Trying not to.

617
00:26:05,928 --> 00:26:09,224
Amelia's... what, she's...
She's halfway there, right?

618
00:26:09,966 --> 00:26:11,514
Yeah,
something like that.

619
00:26:11,598 --> 00:26:12,616
I noticed
she missed a couple days.

620
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:14,497
Everything okay?
There's no complications or...

621
00:26:15,888 --> 00:26:18,094
Uh, hings are
definitely complicated,

622
00:26:18,308 --> 00:26:19,662
but, uh...
But the baby's healthy.

623
00:26:19,747 --> 00:26:20,710
Good, good.

624
00:26:20,795 --> 00:26:22,037
That's good.

625
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:27,013
Yeah,
when Teddy was pregnant,

626
00:26:27,098 --> 00:26:29,304
I remember feeling useless
most of the time.

627
00:26:29,388 --> 00:26:31,686
Definitely feel useless.

628
00:26:31,771 --> 00:26:33,037
Yeah.
How can you not?

629
00:26:33,122 --> 00:26:34,179
I mean,
women go through something

630
00:26:34,263 --> 00:26:35,412
that we can't
ever comprehend.

631
00:26:35,496 --> 00:26:38,130
Best we can do is just listen,
sympathize,

632
00:26:38,215 --> 00:26:40,894
and just keep trying to help...

633
00:26:40,978 --> 00:26:42,786
..even if
you're not sure how.

634
00:26:51,567 --> 00:26:54,184
I'm the one who got
kicked off the case, not you.

635
00:26:54,268 --> 00:26:55,708
You can stay,
so stay.

636
00:26:55,793 --> 00:26:57,162
Please. Consult.

637
00:26:57,247 --> 00:26:58,598
Consult?

638
00:26:58,892 --> 00:27:02,598
Your chief of surgery gave an
order that undoes everything.

639
00:27:02,958 --> 00:27:04,223
I was...

640
00:27:04,458 --> 00:27:06,677
We were making progress.

641
00:27:06,762 --> 00:27:11,318
But now we've really made that
poor woman suffer for nothing.

642
00:27:13,888 --> 00:27:15,763
Just e-mail me
the autopsy report,

643
00:27:15,848 --> 00:27:17,958
and maybe we'll know
what happens then.

644
00:27:19,907 --> 00:27:22,176
- Are you even listening to me?
- I-It's Suzanne's bone-marrow results.

645
00:27:22,269 --> 00:27:24,395
Th-They're showing something
called hemophagocytosis?

646
00:27:24,558 --> 00:27:26,090
Have you heard
of that?

647
00:27:29,888 --> 00:27:33,771
That's MAS,
macrophage activation syndrome.

648
00:27:35,018 --> 00:27:38,020
Her white cells are eating
her other blood cells.

649
00:27:38,105 --> 00:27:40,622
Okay, okay. It's a complication
I've seen of Still's disease.

650
00:27:40,808 --> 00:27:42,310
I've never seen it before
in person.

651
00:27:42,395 --> 00:27:44,684
- MAS or Still's?
- Either.

652
00:27:44,887 --> 00:27:46,514
It's extremely rare.

653
00:27:46,598 --> 00:27:48,826
Okay, so... so this is it?
We... We figured it out?

654
00:27:48,911 --> 00:27:50,661
Yeah!

655
00:27:50,989 --> 00:27:52,340
But we don't have much time

656
00:27:52,425 --> 00:27:53,599
- before her organs shut down.
- Yeah. Right.

657
00:27:53,683 --> 00:27:55,325
Okay, let's go,
let's go. Come on.

658
00:27:57,093 --> 00:27:58,669
She'll need
a few weeks' downtime

659
00:27:58,754 --> 00:28:00,294
and some
physical therapy,

660
00:28:00,379 --> 00:28:03,844
but she should make
a full recovery.

661
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:08,708
I used to judge people who,
uh...

662
00:28:09,848 --> 00:28:13,844
people like me,
home-wreckers.

663
00:28:14,184 --> 00:28:17,098
I never in a million years
thought that I would...

664
00:28:17,942 --> 00:28:19,169
thought that I could.

665
00:28:19,254 --> 00:28:20,644
What happened?

666
00:28:20,981 --> 00:28:22,184
Why did you?

667
00:28:23,292 --> 00:28:25,803
Life came in and taught me
not to judge others.

668
00:28:25,888 --> 00:28:29,104
Life came in and turned me
upside down and shook me.

669
00:28:31,186 --> 00:28:35,551
I'm so in love with her
that I don't care who gets hurt.

670
00:28:36,293 --> 00:28:38,554
I just don't want it
to be me.

671
00:28:39,606 --> 00:28:41,014
Now, look,
I know how that sounds,

672
00:28:41,098 --> 00:28:42,778
but I'm not
a terrible person.

673
00:28:43,114 --> 00:28:45,054
I-I take care
of my parents.

674
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,661
I-I mentor my students.

675
00:28:48,138 --> 00:28:49,684
I plant trees
on the weekends,

676
00:28:49,768 --> 00:28:51,804
and I... and I buy groceries
for homeless people.

677
00:28:52,348 --> 00:28:54,332
I'm not
a terrible person.

678
00:28:56,457 --> 00:28:58,473
I'm just a person
who's terribly in love.

679
00:29:05,853 --> 00:29:07,349
V-fib. Paddles.

680
00:29:07,434 --> 00:29:08,708
What the hell happened?

681
00:29:08,793 --> 00:29:09,552
He was talking,

682
00:29:09,637 --> 00:29:10,755
and he coded
right in front of us.

683
00:29:10,839 --> 00:29:13,253
Uh, chest tube put out
about 400 ccs of blood.

684
00:29:13,338 --> 00:29:14,418
He's bleeding into his chest. Alright,
I got it.

685
00:29:14,502 --> 00:29:16,191
Move, Helm. Thank you.
Okay, charge to 120.

686
00:29:16,435 --> 00:29:17,843
And... clear.

687
00:29:19,675 --> 00:29:21,054
Still V-fib.
Alright, push another epi.

688
00:29:21,138 --> 00:29:22,614
Charge to 200.

689
00:29:22,953 --> 00:29:24,433
Okay, and clear.

690
00:29:24,517 --> 00:29:25,745
Come on, Scott!
Come on!

691
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:27,325
- I'm gonna open his chest.
- Where? Here?

692
00:29:27,409 --> 00:29:28,417
Yeah. Here.

693
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:29,765
Here, let's go.
Alright. Come on.

694
00:29:29,849 --> 00:29:30,849
Betadine.

695
00:29:50,887 --> 00:29:52,512
Hey. Um...

696
00:29:52,926 --> 00:29:55,481
Brian, could you
give us a minute?

697
00:29:55,566 --> 00:29:56,677
I need to talk to Rachel,

698
00:29:56,762 --> 00:29:57,693
and I think
it would be better I...

699
00:29:57,778 --> 00:29:59,582
What is it? Is it...
Is it Scott?

700
00:29:59,883 --> 00:30:02,598
Is it... Does he know?
Did he see Brian?

701
00:30:02,816 --> 00:30:04,629
No.

702
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:07,621
No, he didn't see Brian.

703
00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:12,168
I'm sorry.
Scott, he...

704
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:15,336
He had major bleeding
inside his chest.

705
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:18,046
We tried to resuscitate him,
but we couldn't.

706
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:19,256
He died.

707
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:21,293
W-W-W-What?

708
00:30:21,457 --> 00:30:22,503
Sweetie, I'm...

709
00:30:22,588 --> 00:30:24,545
Don't... Don't...
Don't touch me.

710
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:25,970
Rachel, I...

711
00:30:28,876 --> 00:30:30,387
Please.

712
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:32,386
Please, please.

713
00:30:34,839 --> 00:30:36,629

You're an icon.

762
00:32:40,098 --> 00:32:41,645
It's not even 5:00!

763
00:32:47,222 --> 00:32:48,388
Hey, Suzanne.

764
00:32:48,473 --> 00:32:50,793
Dr. DeLuca.
What are you doing?

765
00:32:50,878 --> 00:32:53,239
Suzanne,
you have Still's disease.

766
00:32:53,324 --> 00:32:54,910
It's rare, really rare.

767
00:32:54,995 --> 00:32:56,591
Fewer than one in a million
people have it.

768
00:32:56,675 --> 00:32:57,957
Dr. DeLuca,
what are you doing?

769
00:32:58,041 --> 00:33:00,296
I don't have time, Dr. Grey. I don't
have time to ask your permission

770
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:01,546
to treat a patient
that I've been monitoring

771
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:02,660
around the clock.

772
00:33:02,745 --> 00:33:04,973
DeLuca, let's step away
from the IV, please.

773
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:09,426
What did he just do?
What did you give her?!

774
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:11,161
Suzanne, there's no cure
for Still's disease,

775
00:33:11,245 --> 00:33:12,491
but it can be managed,

776
00:33:12,576 --> 00:33:13,904
and I just gave you
high-dose steroids,

777
00:33:13,988 --> 00:33:15,466
and if I'm right, you should
start feeling better

778
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:17,106
almost immediately, okay?

779
00:33:17,405 --> 00:33:19,145
Dr. DeLuca,
out in the hallway, please?

780
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:20,646
Wait, what
if you're wrong?

781
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,332
- He's not.
- I'm not.

782
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:26,239
Andrew, we couldn't have had a
conversation before you did that?

783
00:33:26,324 --> 00:33:27,530
Andrew!

784
00:33:33,229 --> 00:33:35,310
Well, if you're wrong,
the steroids could kill her.

785
00:33:35,395 --> 00:33:36,684
I'm not wrong.

786
00:33:36,792 --> 00:33:39,482
You were wrong to take
our case away from us.

787
00:33:39,567 --> 00:33:40,796
He is my resident.

788
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,286
I am his supervisor.

789
00:33:42,371 --> 00:33:44,309
You're also
his girlfriend.

790
00:33:44,692 --> 00:33:46,200
It's muddy.

791
00:33:46,454 --> 00:33:48,070
She'll need supervision.

792
00:33:58,147 --> 00:34:00,482
..make you sleepy.

793
00:34:00,901 --> 00:34:02,565
You look like
a new person.

794
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:03,768
I feel like one.

795
00:34:03,853 --> 00:34:05,361
God, I feel alive again.

796
00:34:05,545 --> 00:34:07,501
So, um, was it
the appendectomy

797
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,807
that gave her
the Still's disease?

798
00:34:08,891 --> 00:34:10,677
Oh, no, we suspect
she had it before.

799
00:34:10,762 --> 00:34:12,179
The flu-like symptoms
and the fatigue,

800
00:34:12,268 --> 00:34:13,354
that's all a part of it.

801
00:34:13,439 --> 00:34:15,022
Oh. And I thought
I was just tired

802
00:34:15,107 --> 00:34:16,277
from chasing my kids around.

803
00:34:16,361 --> 00:34:18,777
Your innate immune system
was in overdrive,

804
00:34:18,861 --> 00:34:20,104
and the high-dose steroids

805
00:34:20,189 --> 00:34:21,650
are bringing that
back to normal,

806
00:34:21,735 --> 00:34:23,097
but you can't stay
on those forever.

807
00:34:23,181 --> 00:34:24,317
So, then what's next?

808
00:34:24,402 --> 00:34:26,237
We're going to set you up
with a rheumatologist.

809
00:34:26,321 --> 00:34:28,527
People with Still's disease
can live very full lives.

810
00:34:28,611 --> 00:34:30,491
We just need to get you
on the right medication.

811
00:34:31,361 --> 00:34:32,931
Can you set me up
with my kids?

812
00:34:33,016 --> 00:34:35,632
Yes. Now that your counts are
up, that's next on the list.

813
00:34:35,941 --> 00:34:38,167
I don't know how you all
figured this out, but thank you.

814
00:34:38,251 --> 00:34:40,357
Of course.
Let me go work on that for you.

815
00:34:40,441 --> 00:34:41,587
Excuse me.

816
00:34:45,183 --> 00:34:47,822
You should get in there and
let them thank you. I'm good.

817
00:34:47,944 --> 00:34:49,487
Why don't you go in there
and take the credit?

818
00:34:49,571 --> 00:34:51,041
You took the case over,
right? It's your patient.

819
00:34:51,125 --> 00:34:53,451
Andrew, that was
an amazing diagnosis.

820
00:34:53,651 --> 00:34:54,627
You saved her life.

821
00:34:54,712 --> 00:34:56,001
Yeah, no thanks to you.

822
00:34:56,985 --> 00:34:59,665
Andrew, but if you
had been wrong,

823
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:01,116
those steroids
could have wiped out

824
00:35:01,201 --> 00:35:02,822
her entire bone marrow.

825
00:35:02,986 --> 00:35:04,439
If you had been wrong,

826
00:35:04,524 --> 00:35:05,900
your decision to go rogue

827
00:35:05,985 --> 00:35:07,861
could've cost you
your entire career.

828
00:35:07,953 --> 00:35:09,699
Okay, i-if I had asked
your permission

829
00:35:09,844 --> 00:35:11,777
to administer the steroids,
would you have granted it?

830
00:35:11,861 --> 00:35:13,067
I would have asked
a few questions.

831
00:35:13,151 --> 00:35:14,744
Yes, and she could've
died when you did.

832
00:35:14,829 --> 00:35:16,245
Okay, listen, Andrew,
you saved her life.

833
00:35:16,329 --> 00:35:17,838
No one is trying to
take that away from you.

834
00:35:17,922 --> 00:35:20,267
All I'm saying is you
could've taken a moment

835
00:35:20,352 --> 00:35:22,478
to just tell me
what you were giving her.

836
00:35:22,931 --> 00:35:24,487
Because at that time,

837
00:35:24,571 --> 00:35:26,197
you were not
in the right state of mind

838
00:35:26,281 --> 00:35:27,744
to be making life-or-death
decisions.

839
00:35:27,829 --> 00:35:30,486
Right decisions.
Life-saving decisions, Mer.

840
00:35:30,571 --> 00:35:33,317
Andrew, you're not sleeping,
you're not eating...

841
00:35:33,401 --> 00:35:35,857
What? You are not
acting like yourself.

842
00:35:35,941 --> 00:35:38,111
You are unbelievable!

843
00:35:38,228 --> 00:35:40,167
You're such a hypocrite!
All... All... All the rules

844
00:35:40,251 --> 00:35:42,323
apply to everybody else
except for you, is that it?!

845
00:35:42,408 --> 00:35:43,317
<i>Speaking Italian...</i>

846
00:35:43,401 --> 00:35:44,955
Hey.
Speaking Italian...

847
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,697
Okay, Hayes, it's fine.
We're fine.

848
00:35:46,781 --> 00:35:47,791
I saved her life!

849
00:35:47,876 --> 00:35:49,056
I did that, okay?!

850
00:35:49,141 --> 00:35:51,908
Against all odds, it was a
one-in-a-million diagnosis!

851
00:35:52,623 --> 00:35:54,276
I did the job
that needed to be done!

852
00:35:54,361 --> 00:35:56,025
Andrew,
listen to yourself!

853
00:35:57,071 --> 00:35:58,651
You sound like
your father.

854
00:36:01,546 --> 00:36:04,662
Just please, can you just
go home and get some sleep?

855
00:36:04,816 --> 00:36:06,736
You just need to
go get some sleep.

856
00:36:06,821 --> 00:36:10,189
I don't need this,
and I don't need you.

857
00:36:11,531 --> 00:36:12,884
So we're done.

858
00:36:13,752 --> 00:36:14,878
I'm done.

859
00:36:20,611 --> 00:36:22,260
You should write him up, Grey.
That's not okay.

860
00:36:22,344 --> 00:36:23,850
Yeah, thanks.

861
00:36:36,304 --> 00:36:38,590
I told you I don't need
you checking up on me.

862
00:36:38,689 --> 00:36:40,775
And I don't need
my residents leaving early

863
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:43,280
because they've
"done enough for the day."

864
00:36:46,414 --> 00:36:48,025
I don't have it in me,
Bailey.

865
00:36:49,103 --> 00:36:50,572
I mean, that set...

866
00:36:51,111 --> 00:36:52,777
they aren't
