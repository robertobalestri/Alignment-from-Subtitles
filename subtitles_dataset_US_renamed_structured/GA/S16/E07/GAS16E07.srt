1
00:00:04,365 --> 00:00:05,972
Talking with a patient's family

2
00:00:05,997 --> 00:00:08,641
is a crash course
in grace under pressure. 

3
00:00:08,642 --> 00:00:10,457
One clumsy word, 

4
00:00:10,482 --> 00:00:12,263
one careless gesture, 

5
00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:13,999
can cause irreparable harm.

6
00:00:14,024 --> 00:00:15,630
Okay, hold on. You know what?

7
00:00:15,655 --> 00:00:18,687
I need to get a picture of her
in this cute little hat.

8
00:00:18,712 --> 00:00:20,457
Okay. Um.

9
00:00:20,482 --> 00:00:22,367
Oh, come on. Great.

10
00:00:22,392 --> 00:00:24,207
Camera's full.

11
00:00:24,232 --> 00:00:25,770
You need to delete some pictures.

12
00:00:25,795 --> 00:00:27,298
No, I just need a bigger phone.

13
00:00:27,323 --> 00:00:28,444
- Okay?
- Yeah, okay. Hold on.

14
00:00:28,469 --> 00:00:29,676
Mwah!

15
00:00:29,676 --> 00:00:31,526
- Have a good day.
- Thank you. You, too.

16
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:33,721
Ideally you're dealing
with a healthy family,

17
00:00:33,746 --> 00:00:37,012
where the main focus is on the
well-being of their loved one.

18
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:39,153
But that is not often the case.

19
00:00:42,881 --> 00:00:44,982
Hey, what are you doing
with that elephant?

20
00:00:45,007 --> 00:00:46,754
Uh... Uh Leo left it at day care,

21
00:00:46,779 --> 00:00:49,775
and I need to give it back to
Owen before he freaks out.

22
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,025
It's his favorite.

23
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:53,741
We have three of them.
And that one's Ellis's.

24
00:00:53,741 --> 00:00:56,112
Owen doesn't know I'm pregnant.

25
00:00:56,137 --> 00:00:57,778
And I think I should probably tell him.

26
00:00:57,803 --> 00:00:59,028
Yeah. Probably.

27
00:00:59,053 --> 00:01:00,625
Unless, I mean...

28
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:02,986
He has his own baby with another person.

29
00:01:03,011 --> 00:01:04,167
I mean, does it really matter?

30
00:01:04,192 --> 00:01:06,424
He will get it, eventually,

31
00:01:06,449 --> 00:01:08,796
when I'm huge and in labor and...

32
00:01:08,821 --> 00:01:10,946
Right. Well, let me know what you decide.
I can't be late.

33
00:01:13,207 --> 00:01:16,446
But a surgeon is required, above all,

34
00:01:16,471 --> 00:01:18,042
to tell the truth.

35
00:01:19,526 --> 00:01:21,203
And the truth is messy.

36
00:01:22,721 --> 00:01:23,952
- Catherine.
- Maggie.

37
00:01:23,953 --> 00:01:26,635
Hi! How is it being back?

38
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:29,448
- Oh, it's good to be operating again.
- Yeah.

39
00:01:29,473 --> 00:01:33,581
Tell me, how are things
here with the restructuring?

40
00:01:33,606 --> 00:01:35,455
Uh, Tom Koracick is...

41
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:38,259
a... brilliant surgeon.

42
00:01:38,259 --> 00:01:40,178
Not everybody's cup of tea.

43
00:01:40,203 --> 00:01:42,713
I heard he and Jackson
really got into it.

44
00:01:42,738 --> 00:01:44,275
Oh, yeah, I wouldn't know.

45
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:46,046
That boy can be so tight-lipped.

46
00:01:46,071 --> 00:01:47,366
He gets it from me.

47
00:01:47,391 --> 00:01:51,141
And I know that's hard
to live with at times.

48
00:01:51,142 --> 00:01:53,616
Have you and Jackson talked much lately?

49
00:01:53,641 --> 00:01:55,942
We should have dinner soon.

50
00:01:55,967 --> 00:01:57,609
The four of us.

51
00:01:57,634 --> 00:02:00,006
- I don't know if that's such a good... Oh.
- Oh, no excuses.

52
00:02:00,031 --> 00:02:01,985
Come on. Family's too important.

53
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:03,547
- Yeah, okay.
- Mm.

54
00:02:08,534 --> 00:02:09,828
I'm looking forward to it.

55
00:02:09,853 --> 00:02:11,148
Me, too. Yeah.

56
00:02:14,922 --> 00:02:16,842
Richard Webber, are you seriously

57
00:02:16,867 --> 00:02:19,342
just gonna walk on by me like that?

58
00:02:19,367 --> 00:02:21,807
I'm sorry about what happened
in the diner.

59
00:02:21,832 --> 00:02:24,272
- Let me make it up to you.
- I don't think so.

60
00:02:24,297 --> 00:02:27,224
Just coffee... I'll keep my distance.

61
00:02:27,249 --> 00:02:28,799
It's not a good idea.

62
00:02:32,423 --> 00:02:34,401
Well, let's go ahead
and change her pain meds

63
00:02:34,402 --> 00:02:35,523
from I.V. to oral.

64
00:02:35,548 --> 00:02:38,022
- We need to talk.
- I am talking.

65
00:02:38,047 --> 00:02:39,342
To someone else.

66
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:41,460
Sorry about that.
And check her drain output.

67
00:02:41,485 --> 00:02:43,946
If it's below 20 cc,
we can go ahead and remove it.

68
00:02:43,946 --> 00:02:45,483
Yes, you were saying?

69
00:02:45,508 --> 00:02:47,046
Your mother would like to have dinner.

70
00:02:47,071 --> 00:02:48,088
I know. She texted.

71
00:02:48,113 --> 00:02:49,569
She thinks we're still together.

72
00:02:50,257 --> 00:02:51,905
Oh. Yeah. "Oh."

73
00:02:52,578 --> 00:02:55,617
I take it you didn't say
anything to Richard, then?

74
00:02:55,937 --> 00:02:58,794
W-Well, I never see Richard
because he's, um...

75
00:02:58,819 --> 00:03:00,739
- he's been fired.
- And that's my fault, too?

76
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:01,988
I-I'm having trouble

77
00:03:02,013 --> 00:03:03,733
- keeping track with you.
- You know what? It's fine.

78
00:03:03,734 --> 00:03:05,758
We can just tell them over dinner.
You should bring Vic.

79
00:03:05,783 --> 00:03:08,153
- That'd be fun.
- I should bring Vic.

80
00:03:08,178 --> 00:03:09,786
- Vic is fun.
- Ohh.

81
00:03:09,811 --> 00:03:11,765
Do you guys laugh a lot
when you talk about her fiancÃ©

82
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:13,293
who died 10 minutes bef...

83
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:15,688
I wonder if you can help me.
I'm looking for Richard Webber.

84
00:03:15,713 --> 00:03:17,772
I'm sorry, does that woman look like me?

85
00:03:17,797 --> 00:03:20,331
I dunno. I'd have to see her scowl first.

86
00:03:20,331 --> 00:03:22,180
But he works here. I know it.

87
00:03:22,205 --> 00:03:23,431
Richard Webber.

88
00:03:23,456 --> 00:03:24,785
Can you check with someone?

89
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:26,764
Take it easy, Sabi.
Don't wear yourself out.

90
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:28,084
Yeah, I know who he is,

91
00:03:28,109 --> 00:03:29,808
but he doesn't work here anymore.

92
00:03:29,809 --> 00:03:31,519
You need to go to
Pacific Northwest General.

93
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:33,325
I'm sorry, I couldn't help but overhear.

94
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:34,784
Are you looking for Richard Webber?

95
00:03:34,809 --> 00:03:36,693
Oh, my God, it's you!

96
00:03:36,718 --> 00:03:37,977
Maggie!

97
00:03:38,002 --> 00:03:39,393
Oh!

98
00:03:39,394 --> 00:03:41,348
I can't believe it.

99
00:03:42,692 --> 00:03:44,229
And who am I now?

100
00:03:44,254 --> 00:03:45,792
Oh, sorry. I-I...

101
00:03:45,817 --> 00:03:47,320
I'm Sabrina.

102
00:03:47,345 --> 00:03:50,063
But everyone calls me Sabi.
Rhymes with "baby."

103
00:03:50,088 --> 00:03:52,355
And this is my dad, Chris.

104
00:03:53,681 --> 00:03:55,530
I-I'm sorry, I'm still confused.

105
00:03:55,555 --> 00:03:58,377
I... I'm Sabrina Webber.

106
00:03:58,402 --> 00:04:00,357
Richard's my uncle.

107
00:04:00,382 --> 00:04:02,105
And he's your biological father.

108
00:04:02,105 --> 00:04:03,425
So...

109
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:05,413
we're your family!

111
00:04:16,954 --> 00:04:19,706
And I am not a big crier,
but I'm telling to you,

112
00:04:19,731 --> 00:04:21,130
I cried for days.

113
00:04:21,155 --> 00:04:23,109
I mean, that poor little hamster.

114
00:04:23,134 --> 00:04:25,762
Long story short... never buy
a pet on Craigslist.

115
00:04:25,763 --> 00:04:27,717
You wanna see a picture? It's gross.

116
00:04:27,742 --> 00:04:29,418
- You'll love it.
- Oh, oh, no, thank you.

117
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:33,411
So, Uncle Richard got fired?

118
00:04:33,436 --> 00:04:34,731
What happened?

119
00:04:34,756 --> 00:04:35,986
It's a long story.

120
00:04:35,987 --> 00:04:37,281
Drinking again?

121
00:04:37,306 --> 00:04:39,191
What? No, no.

122
00:04:39,216 --> 00:04:41,136
It was a-a bureaucratic matter.

123
00:04:41,161 --> 00:04:42,837
"Bureaucratic matter"?

124
00:04:42,862 --> 00:04:44,732
So there's a really long story.

125
00:04:46,017 --> 00:04:48,978
So you're, like, a super genius, right?

126
00:04:49,003 --> 00:04:50,750
I mean, well, that's what
all the articles say.

127
00:04:51,885 --> 00:04:54,221
I'm sorry, this is j... It's so weird.

128
00:04:54,246 --> 00:04:55,784
You know so much about me,

129
00:04:55,809 --> 00:04:58,568
and I know almost nothing about you.

130
00:04:58,569 --> 00:05:01,147
Not a surprise. Richard's ashamed of us.

131
00:05:01,172 --> 00:05:02,293
What?

132
00:05:02,318 --> 00:05:03,926
No, that can't be true.

133
00:05:03,951 --> 00:05:05,957
Only you've never talked to us,

134
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:07,426
never met us, never even heard of us.

135
00:05:07,451 --> 00:05:08,746
Yeah, d-don't mind him.

136
00:05:08,771 --> 00:05:09,891
He's a grump.

137
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:12,044
Uncle Richard called us a while back,

138
00:05:12,069 --> 00:05:13,398
after your podcast,

139
00:05:13,423 --> 00:05:15,216
explained the whole secret affair thing.

140
00:05:15,217 --> 00:05:16,997
Then I read all about you.

141
00:05:17,022 --> 00:05:18,421
Made sense, too.

142
00:05:18,446 --> 00:05:20,990
Genius is in our blood.

143
00:05:21,015 --> 00:05:23,572
You know I got into Stanford. Uh-huh...

144
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:25,596
Woulda gone, too, except in-state tuition

145
00:05:25,621 --> 00:05:27,853
- is a whole lot cheaper.
- Yeah, yeah.

146
00:05:27,878 --> 00:05:30,110
I'm sorry, this is just so weird!

147
00:05:30,135 --> 00:05:32,505
I mean, we look the same,
sound the same...

148
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:33,825
We could be twins!

149
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:35,804
Well, twins, no...
I mean, we're genetically...

150
00:05:35,829 --> 00:05:36,916
we're more... Oh.

151
00:05:36,941 --> 00:05:38,825
...akin to...

152
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:42,471
Well, that's... that's weird.

153
00:05:42,496 --> 00:05:44,069
Mary Griggs to L&D.

154
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:47,391
Mary Griggs to L&D.

155
00:05:47,392 --> 00:05:48,790
- Owen.
- Yeah.

156
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:50,248
A... Amelia. Everything okay?

157
00:05:50,273 --> 00:05:51,290
Fine.

158
00:05:51,315 --> 00:05:53,628
Uh, great, actually. Um...

159
00:05:54,092 --> 00:05:57,679
I just wanted to, uh...
to give this back to Leo.

160
00:05:57,704 --> 00:05:59,847
Oh, well, thanks,
but I don't think this is...

161
00:05:59,848 --> 00:06:01,373
Link and I are having a baby.

162
00:06:03,423 --> 00:06:04,857
Wow. Um... okay.

163
00:06:04,882 --> 00:06:06,211
And you need to know.

164
00:06:06,236 --> 00:06:07,843
Well, I want Leo
to be in the baby's life.

165
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:10,552
He's already such a good big
brother to Allison, and I...

166
00:06:10,577 --> 00:06:12,253
I'm... realizing in this moment

167
00:06:12,278 --> 00:06:15,114
that we've gone from zero to
three babies in 60 seconds.

168
00:06:15,114 --> 00:06:18,041
So... yay for all the babies!

169
00:06:18,066 --> 00:06:21,999
- Incoming!
- Cassidy Gardner, 25, GCS 14,

170
00:06:22,024 --> 00:06:23,909
blunt trauma to the abdomen, arm lac.

171
00:06:23,934 --> 00:06:25,436
Hemodynamically stable.

172
00:06:26,503 --> 00:06:27,797
Okay, what happened?

173
00:06:27,822 --> 00:06:29,423
I fell down the stairs. I just fell.

174
00:06:29,424 --> 00:06:30,996
Her son called 911.

175
00:06:31,021 --> 00:06:32,940
Henry, Mommy's gonna be fine.

176
00:06:32,965 --> 00:06:34,503
You did real good, buddy.

177
00:06:34,528 --> 00:06:36,936
So someone's gonna sit with you
until we take care of your mom, okay?

178
00:06:36,937 --> 00:06:38,127
I got him.

179
00:06:38,152 --> 00:06:40,037
- I need the practice.
- Thanks.

180
00:06:40,062 --> 00:06:41,148
Okay, let's go.

181
00:06:41,173 --> 00:06:43,509
We need chest and pelvic X-rays now.

182
00:06:48,048 --> 00:06:50,558
Uncle Richard!

183
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:52,329
Oh! Sabi?

184
00:06:52,354 --> 00:06:54,047
What... What are you...

185
00:06:54,047 --> 00:06:56,244
Maggie? Chris? W-W-What's going on?

186
00:06:56,269 --> 00:06:58,223
They were looking for you at Grey-Sloan.

187
00:06:58,248 --> 00:07:00,445
- It's so good to see you, Uncle Richard!
- Oh, my gosh.

188
00:07:00,446 --> 00:07:02,956
We missed you at Christmas.
And Thanksgiving.

189
00:07:02,981 --> 00:07:05,525
And Easter and birthdays
and family reunions.

190
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:06,885
I-I-I know. It's, uh,

191
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:08,338
been a tough year.

192
00:07:08,363 --> 00:07:10,080
Has it been a tough five years?

193
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:13,272
Anyway, hi!

194
00:07:13,297 --> 00:07:15,008
Hi.

195
00:07:15,033 --> 00:07:16,987
Well... Well, um...

196
00:07:17,012 --> 00:07:18,273
Welcome to Pac North.

197
00:07:18,298 --> 00:07:19,974
Um, you want the tour?

198
00:07:19,999 --> 00:07:21,328
Well, that sounds like fun,

199
00:07:21,353 --> 00:07:23,550
but maybe in a minute.
I'm kinda worn out.

200
00:07:23,575 --> 00:07:25,456
Okay, sweetie, take it easy.

201
00:07:25,456 --> 00:07:28,174
And I need you look at something first...

202
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:30,152
I don't think he needs
to see a dead hamster.

203
00:07:30,177 --> 00:07:31,299
No.

204
00:07:31,324 --> 00:07:32,827
It's even grosser than that.

205
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:35,222
Oh, okay.

206
00:07:39,971 --> 00:07:42,098
Why are you showing us a picture

207
00:07:42,123 --> 00:07:44,622
of an insanely large biatrial myxoma?

208
00:07:45,491 --> 00:07:46,786
Because it's mine.

209
00:07:53,794 --> 00:07:55,368
You haven't had any other symptoms?

210
00:07:55,393 --> 00:07:57,104
Some swelling in my legs.

211
00:07:57,129 --> 00:07:59,361
Um, and I lose my breath sometimes

212
00:07:59,386 --> 00:08:01,096
when I walk my dog.

213
00:08:01,121 --> 00:08:02,694
These scans are three weeks old.

214
00:08:02,719 --> 00:08:04,707
Why did you wait so long to come?

215
00:08:04,732 --> 00:08:06,339
My doctor said it could be some time

216
00:08:06,364 --> 00:08:07,902
before it got really bad.

217
00:08:07,927 --> 00:08:10,389
And news like this,
it takes a minute to process.

218
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:12,379
And Dad wanted to go up to Chicago,

219
00:08:12,404 --> 00:08:14,462
but I wanted to come here.

220
00:08:14,487 --> 00:08:16,024
I'm glad you agreed.

221
00:08:16,049 --> 00:08:17,897
I didn't want her traveling alone.

222
00:08:18,547 --> 00:08:19,738
Okay, Sabrina, this kind of...

223
00:08:19,763 --> 00:08:23,217
- Sabi, please.
- Okay. Sabi.

224
00:08:23,217 --> 00:08:24,963
This kind of tumor is operable,

225
00:08:24,988 --> 00:08:26,873
but it can grow really rapidly,

226
00:08:26,898 --> 00:08:29,222
so we need to get
some new imaging right away.

227
00:08:30,589 --> 00:08:32,995
It was really dumb of me
to wait, wasn't it?

228
00:08:35,928 --> 00:08:37,744
Let's, uh... Let's go get those scans.

229
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:44,408
Was your dad home when your mom fell?

230
00:08:44,433 --> 00:08:46,318
I don't have a dad.

231
00:08:46,343 --> 00:08:48,193
I came home from school on the bus,

232
00:08:48,218 --> 00:08:52,490
and Mom was in the basement
o-o-on the floor.

233
00:08:52,608 --> 00:08:54,735
She couldn't move.

234
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,124
Is she gonna be okay?

235
00:08:56,149 --> 00:08:58,208
She has got a really great
team of doctors

236
00:08:58,233 --> 00:09:00,153
taking care of her.

237
00:09:00,178 --> 00:09:01,715
Here.

238
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,972
Maybe holding this guy
will make you feel better.

239
00:09:07,241 --> 00:09:09,612
I'm so sorry about this wait.
Do you want to sit down?

240
00:09:09,637 --> 00:09:11,144
No, no. I'm okay now.

241
00:09:11,145 --> 00:09:12,301
Minute you start acting sick,

242
00:09:12,326 --> 00:09:14,454
that's when you really get sick.

243
00:09:15,207 --> 00:09:16,606
So...

244
00:09:16,631 --> 00:09:17,879
what's the tea?

245
00:09:19,974 --> 00:09:21,998
- You know what tea is, right?
- Yeah, no, I do.

246
00:09:22,023 --> 00:09:23,733
I just, uh...

247
00:09:23,758 --> 00:09:24,878
I mostly work.

248
00:09:24,903 --> 00:09:27,280
There's nothing? No scandal?

249
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,679
No love life?!

250
00:09:28,704 --> 00:09:31,629
Uh, my ex-boyfriend rebounded
with a firefighter?

251
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:32,809
Gay?

252
00:09:32,834 --> 00:09:34,650
Hot chick.

253
00:09:34,675 --> 00:09:36,490
Okay, then. I hate him.

254
00:09:37,727 --> 00:09:39,716
We're family. I've got you.

255
00:09:39,741 --> 00:09:42,459
I hope he wakes up tomorrow,
realizes what a mistake he made,

256
00:09:42,484 --> 00:09:45,152
but it's too late because
you're with Idris Elba.

257
00:09:45,177 --> 00:09:46,715
Oh, girl.

258
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:48,208
Mm-hmm!

259
00:09:48,233 --> 00:09:50,048
Girl, gimme your phone.
You need my number.

260
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:54,412
Here.

261
00:09:54,437 --> 00:09:56,252
Mm.

262
00:09:56,277 --> 00:09:58,161
Hey, do you like crossword puzzles?

263
00:09:58,186 --> 00:09:59,273
Love 'em.

264
00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:00,843
Acrostics, Sudoku,

265
00:10:00,868 --> 00:10:02,128
but crosswords are the best.

266
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:03,618
I only do the ones
on the weekends, though,

267
00:10:03,643 --> 00:10:05,701
- because the other ones are...
- ...too easy.

268
00:10:05,726 --> 00:10:08,617
- Right?! I get so bored!
- I know.

269
00:10:08,642 --> 00:10:11,429
We have so much shared DNA,
I bet we have a ton in common.

270
00:10:11,476 --> 00:10:12,944
- Do you like classical music?
- Love it.

271
00:10:12,969 --> 00:10:14,472
- Can you whistle?
- Yes!

272
00:10:14,497 --> 00:10:16,538
I know that's not necessarily,
like, a genetic thing...

273
00:10:16,563 --> 00:10:18,916
Um they're, uh... they're ready for you.

274
00:10:18,941 --> 00:10:20,817
Okay.

275
00:10:20,842 --> 00:10:23,038
- To be continued... Cuz!
- Yeah.

276
00:10:41,761 --> 00:10:43,542
This thing smells new.

277
00:10:43,567 --> 00:10:45,712
Am I the first person in it?

278
00:10:45,836 --> 00:10:47,131
Close to it.

279
00:10:47,156 --> 00:10:48,277
Hold still now.

280
00:10:49,725 --> 00:10:52,302
I can't imagine how strange
this must be for you.

281
00:10:52,727 --> 00:10:55,488
- I'm sorry I didn't tell you...
- Oh, are you kidding?!

282
00:10:55,706 --> 00:10:57,555
It is fascinating.

283
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:59,986
And, yes, it's really, really strange.

284
00:11:00,011 --> 00:11:02,912
I've never had a relative
who looked like me before.

285
00:11:03,611 --> 00:11:06,781
And she's just been out there
practically my entire life,

286
00:11:06,806 --> 00:11:08,746
just having different experiences.

287
00:11:08,771 --> 00:11:11,211
I wonder if we've ever been
in the same town

288
00:11:11,236 --> 00:11:13,051
at the same time before today.

289
00:11:13,076 --> 00:11:15,586
I was in Dayton once.
I had a long layover.

290
00:11:15,611 --> 00:11:17,114
I went to the mall.

291
00:11:17,139 --> 00:11:20,121
Has it really been five years
since you saw each other?

292
00:11:21,268 --> 00:11:23,041
Uh... Sabi's not like the others.

293
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:26,211
My brother and sister
always resented me for leaving,

294
00:11:26,494 --> 00:11:28,691
resented my success.

295
00:11:28,716 --> 00:11:30,778
Accused me of putting on airs

296
00:11:30,803 --> 00:11:32,509
and acting like I was better.

297
00:11:34,158 --> 00:11:37,180
Adele always had a way
of smoothing things over.

298
00:11:37,205 --> 00:11:39,390
I should've tried harder after she died.

299
00:11:41,533 --> 00:11:44,020
And they didn't know about me
until the podcast.

300
00:11:44,963 --> 00:11:46,812
When I called to tell them, they, uh,

301
00:11:46,837 --> 00:11:48,244
said some vicious things,

302
00:11:48,244 --> 00:11:51,796
and I think I just wanted
to protect you from that.

303
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,609
But it's, uh,

304
00:11:54,634 --> 00:11:56,726
it's nice to see the two of you
get along so well.

305
00:11:58,493 --> 00:11:59,995
Oh, God.

306
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:02,113
The tumor's reaching up through
the tricuspid valve

307
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:03,814
and into her pulmonary artery now.

308
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:05,264
I think it's doubled in size.

309
00:12:05,264 --> 00:12:07,774
This might be the biggest
heart tumor I have ever seen.

310
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:10,690
Is somebody gonna get me out
of this thing or what?

311
00:12:13,961 --> 00:12:17,269
FAST exam shows the free fluid
on the perisplenic space.

312
00:12:17,294 --> 00:12:20,448
Ma'am, did you have any
symptoms before you fell?

313
00:12:20,479 --> 00:12:22,226
I-I was bringing the laundry upstairs,

314
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:23,371
and I got really dizzy.

315
00:12:23,396 --> 00:12:25,364
Uh-huh. Wait, you see that?

316
00:12:25,993 --> 00:12:27,115
Excess fluid?

317
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:28,989
That's a heartbeat.

318
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:30,066
Ma'am...

319
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:34,044
Ma'am, did you know
that you were pregnant?

320
00:12:34,069 --> 00:12:35,571
Was or am?

321
00:12:37,437 --> 00:12:38,890
We have a strong heartbeat.
Your baby's okay.

322
00:12:38,915 --> 00:12:40,349
Okay?

323
00:12:40,374 --> 00:12:42,363
It didn't work.

324
00:12:42,388 --> 00:12:43,682
What... What didn't?

325
00:12:43,707 --> 00:12:45,556
I can't have another baby.

326
00:12:45,581 --> 00:12:46,980
I can't.

327
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:54,744
Jeanette Brody to Admitting.

328
00:12:54,769 --> 00:12:56,359
Jeanette Brody to Admitting.

329
00:12:57,849 --> 00:12:59,730
- Hey. Hey.
- Hey.

330
00:12:59,755 --> 00:13:00,806
How's Mom?

331
00:13:00,831 --> 00:13:02,140
She's, um...

332
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,389
Listen, her fall wasn't an accident.

333
00:13:05,414 --> 00:13:07,687
She was trying to terminate a pregnancy.

334
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:10,694
By throwing herself down the stairs?

335
00:13:10,719 --> 00:13:12,257
I don't know. She's not talking much...

336
00:13:12,282 --> 00:13:13,680
Well, do you want me to try?

337
00:13:13,705 --> 00:13:15,312
She might be more comfortable
talking to another woman.

338
00:13:15,337 --> 00:13:16,388
I can say it's a neuro check.

339
00:13:16,413 --> 00:13:17,847
Sure, might help.

340
00:13:17,872 --> 00:13:19,061
I already paged psych,

341
00:13:19,086 --> 00:13:20,555
but they take forever around here, so...

342
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:23,159
- How pregnant is she?
- 8, 10 weeks. I'm not sure.

343
00:13:23,184 --> 00:13:24,340
Uh, if you're not up to this,

344
00:13:24,365 --> 00:13:26,319
then I can get someone else, you know.

345
00:13:26,344 --> 00:13:27,847
Why wouldn't I feel up to it?

346
00:13:29,196 --> 00:13:30,733
Because I'm all knocked up?

347
00:13:30,758 --> 00:13:32,156
It's okay, Owen.

348
00:13:32,181 --> 00:13:33,303
I don't need a fainting couch.

349
00:13:33,328 --> 00:13:34,831
I will be fine.

350
00:13:34,856 --> 00:13:36,462
Yeah, okay. Thank you.

351
00:13:38,915 --> 00:13:41,494
- That's the same tumor?
- Yes.

352
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,104
And now it's extending
into your pulmonary artery.

353
00:13:44,104 --> 00:13:46,650
Looks kinda like a baby swan
with that little neck.

354
00:13:46,675 --> 00:13:48,281
Sabi...

355
00:13:48,306 --> 00:13:50,191
this tumor isn't stable.

356
00:13:50,216 --> 00:13:52,136
It could stop your heart's
ability to pump blood.

357
00:13:52,161 --> 00:13:53,941
We need to get you up to surgery.

358
00:13:53,966 --> 00:13:55,191
Today.

359
00:13:55,216 --> 00:13:57,483
- Well, who's gonna do it?
- You're in luck.

360
00:13:57,508 --> 00:13:59,844
This happens to be my specialty.

361
00:13:59,869 --> 00:14:01,893
You? But you don't work here.

362
00:14:01,918 --> 00:14:03,941
They granted me privileges,
so we're good to go.

363
00:14:03,966 --> 00:14:05,271
But we're family.

364
00:14:05,272 --> 00:14:07,122
And we're basically twins.

365
00:14:07,147 --> 00:14:09,309
I mean, What if you see me lying
on that operating table,

366
00:14:09,334 --> 00:14:11,810
and you freak out because
it's you on the table?

367
00:14:11,835 --> 00:14:13,372
That is not a thing I do.

368
00:14:13,397 --> 00:14:15,977
And I'm the best.

369
00:14:16,002 --> 00:14:17,574
Then get second best.

370
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:20,360
Sabi, she won't even be able
to see your face.

371
00:14:20,361 --> 00:14:21,689
It's covered during surgery.

372
00:14:21,714 --> 00:14:24,294
Okay, that is really creepy.
Do people know that?

373
00:14:24,319 --> 00:14:26,516
I-Isn't there a law
against operating on family?

374
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:28,229
It isn't a law. It's a guideline.

375
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:30,774
And since we've only known
each other about two hours,

376
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:33,830
I'm not really sure how it applies here.

377
00:14:33,855 --> 00:14:36,296
Apple doesn't fall too far from the tree.

378
00:14:36,321 --> 00:14:37,953
- Excuse me?
- You're steamrolling her,

379
00:14:37,978 --> 00:14:39,039
thinking you know what's best.

380
00:14:39,064 --> 00:14:40,948
You're not even listening
to her concerns.

381
00:14:40,973 --> 00:14:42,656
I'm listening. They're just not valid.

382
00:14:42,656 --> 00:14:44,576
Not valid?

383
00:14:44,601 --> 00:14:47,319
We look alike,
we have some things in common,

384
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:49,541
but we're... we're not family.

385
00:14:49,566 --> 00:14:51,098
Not in the way that matters.

386
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:53,956
I am the best cardiothoracic
surgeon in the Northwest.

387
00:14:53,981 --> 00:14:56,595
I run my department. I innovate.

388
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:58,226
You want me in that room.

389
00:14:58,251 --> 00:14:59,962
What makes you think
you know what she wants?

390
00:14:59,987 --> 00:15:02,658
- You don't even know her.
- Which is why I can do this!

391
00:15:04,141 --> 00:15:06,789
Richard? A little support, please?

392
00:15:06,814 --> 00:15:08,421
Um... you know,

393
00:15:08,446 --> 00:15:10,540
I don't trust the cardio surgeon
who's here today.

394
00:15:10,565 --> 00:15:11,720
Thank you.

395
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:13,621
So I am your only option.

396
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:14,906
But, um...

397
00:15:14,931 --> 00:15:18,443
there is an on-call surgeon
who's quite good.

398
00:15:19,202 --> 00:15:21,468
I'll, um... I'll make a call.

399
00:15:21,493 --> 00:15:22,822
Thank you.

400
00:15:22,847 --> 00:15:24,323
Took you long enough.

401
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,419
Maggie.

402
00:15:37,976 --> 00:15:40,694
Um, will you, uh, stick around
and brief the surgeon?

403
00:15:40,719 --> 00:15:42,222
Maybe consult?

404
00:15:42,247 --> 00:15:44,548
You want me to consult for
someone who's not as good as me

405
00:15:44,573 --> 00:15:46,319
instead of giving your niece
the best shot she's got?

406
00:15:46,344 --> 00:15:47,951
Maggie, they're family.

407
00:15:47,976 --> 00:15:49,478
So you're just gonna agree with them

408
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:51,666
because of some bad history
with your brother?

409
00:15:51,691 --> 00:15:54,062
No, that's not what I meant.

410
00:15:54,087 --> 00:15:55,788
Look, they're your family, too.

411
00:15:55,813 --> 00:15:58,185
I know you just met
and it may not feel that way,

412
00:15:58,210 --> 00:15:59,920
but they... look, one day, it could.

413
00:15:59,945 --> 00:16:02,587
And God forbid something
goes wrong in the OR and...

414
00:16:02,612 --> 00:16:04,878
I'll always be the love child
who killed your favorite niece?

415
00:16:04,903 --> 00:16:06,372
Oh, come on, now.

416
00:16:06,397 --> 00:16:08,509
You'll never get a chance to know them.

417
00:16:08,534 --> 00:16:10,071
And I never would've known they existed

418
00:16:10,096 --> 00:16:11,808
if they hadn't come here.

419
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:15,661
Richard, your niece came here
for help as a doctor.

420
00:16:15,686 --> 00:16:19,504
It's too bad you can't do her
the favor of thinking like one.

421
00:16:19,529 --> 00:16:21,241
Yes, I'll consult.

422
00:16:21,266 --> 00:16:22,722
Text me when he's here.

423
00:16:28,809 --> 00:16:31,388
No sign of concussion.

424
00:16:31,606 --> 00:16:32,970
How's Henry? Is he scared?

425
00:16:32,995 --> 00:16:34,844
Henry is over the moon.

426
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:37,705
A very sweet nurse showed him
the snack drawer.

427
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:38,957
Cassidy, the CT shows

428
00:16:38,957 --> 00:16:40,772
that there is some bleeding
in your spleen.

429
00:16:40,797 --> 00:16:42,578
We're gonna have to take you up
to the OR to remove it,

430
00:16:42,603 --> 00:16:44,453
and I can do that laparoscopically.

431
00:16:44,478 --> 00:16:46,298
I-I don't have insurance right now.

432
00:16:46,299 --> 00:16:47,732
Henry just qualified for a state program,

433
00:16:47,757 --> 00:16:49,051
but I'm still waiting to hear.

434
00:16:49,076 --> 00:16:50,961
Emergency departments
don't turn people away,

435
00:16:50,986 --> 00:16:52,732
regardless of their financial situation,

436
00:16:52,757 --> 00:16:54,850
so they will give you the
surgery that you need, okay?

437
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:58,844
But surgery, uh,

438
00:16:58,869 --> 00:17:01,551
will put the fetus at risk,
so, I have to ask you...

439
00:17:01,576 --> 00:17:03,340
Are you planning on keeping
this pregnancy?

440
00:17:03,341 --> 00:17:05,087
I love Henry.

441
00:17:05,112 --> 00:17:06,406
But it's a lot.

442
00:17:06,431 --> 00:17:08,004
I already work at two restaurants,

443
00:17:08,029 --> 00:17:09,948
and they try to give me
a flexible schedule,

444
00:17:09,973 --> 00:17:12,291
but there's only so much
that they can do.

445
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:14,072
And another kid...
I mean, that's way more money,

446
00:17:14,097 --> 00:17:16,815
and... and even more time
away from Henry.

447
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:19,662
I can't... I can't and I don't want to.

448
00:17:19,687 --> 00:17:21,504
So you threw yourself down the stairs?

449
00:17:21,504 --> 00:17:23,286
What?! Oh, my God, no!

450
00:17:23,311 --> 00:17:25,577
No, I tried to go to a clinic
that had financial assistance

451
00:17:25,602 --> 00:17:26,862
three times,

452
00:17:26,887 --> 00:17:28,181
but something always fell through.

453
00:17:28,206 --> 00:17:30,716
Henry got sick
or no one could sub for me.

454
00:17:30,741 --> 00:17:31,981
I-I ran out of favors.

455
00:17:31,981 --> 00:17:33,936
So I looked online, and I found this herb

456
00:17:33,961 --> 00:17:35,151
that was supposed to work.

457
00:17:35,176 --> 00:17:37,582
I-I doubled the recipe
to make sure it would work,

458
00:17:37,607 --> 00:17:39,457
but it made me dizzy.

459
00:17:39,482 --> 00:17:40,985
And then I fell.

460
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:42,295
I just fell.

461
00:17:43,278 --> 00:17:45,198
I love my son.

462
00:17:45,223 --> 00:17:48,496
And I would never do anything
to try to hurt myself.

463
00:17:48,521 --> 00:17:50,844
I would never do anything
to try to hurt him.

464
00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:52,232
Okay, Cassidy, listen.

465
00:17:52,257 --> 00:17:53,598
You are okay right now.

466
00:17:53,923 --> 00:17:55,658
And Henry is okay.

467
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:58,739
And if you want an abortion,
Dr. Hunt can get someone from OB

468
00:17:58,764 --> 00:18:00,267
to do that during your surgery

469
00:18:00,292 --> 00:18:02,836
once the bleeding in your
abdomen is under control.

470
00:18:02,861 --> 00:18:04,260
Oh, God, really?

471
00:18:04,285 --> 00:18:05,510
Thank you.

472
00:18:05,535 --> 00:18:07,078
- Thank you so much...
- Um, actually, Cassidy,

473
00:18:07,078 --> 00:18:09,276
I think we want to focus on
the fall injuries first.

474
00:18:09,301 --> 00:18:10,872
Okay?

475
00:18:10,897 --> 00:18:12,157
We can address the pregnancy

476
00:18:12,182 --> 00:18:14,241
once we know that you're all right.

477
00:18:14,266 --> 00:18:16,186
Oh. Okay.

478
00:18:16,211 --> 00:18:19,519
Okay, so, we'll see you up
in the OR shortly.

479
00:18:26,558 --> 00:18:28,164
- What are you doing?
- You really overstepped in there.

480
00:18:28,189 --> 00:18:29,962
I'm a trauma surgeon.
I don't order abortions.

481
00:18:29,962 --> 00:18:31,986
You would have if the fetus
hadn't survived.

482
00:18:32,011 --> 00:18:33,525
But it did.

483
00:18:33,526 --> 00:18:36,279
Owen, she's eight weeks.
She doesn't need a full D&C.

484
00:18:36,304 --> 00:18:37,667
Exactly. It's not emergent,

485
00:18:37,692 --> 00:18:39,265
but her internal injuries are.

486
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:41,912
So I'm gonna deal with those,
and then she can go see an OB.

487
00:18:42,254 --> 00:18:44,034
She seems pretty clear in her thinking

488
00:18:44,059 --> 00:18:45,354
and committed to her plan.

489
00:18:45,379 --> 00:18:47,645
Why not just give her
the help she's asking for?

490
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:49,035
Thank you, Amelia, for your consult,

491
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:50,529
but I'm gonna take it from here, okay?

492
00:18:59,215 --> 00:19:00,414
Hey.

493
00:19:01,299 --> 00:19:03,169
- What are you doing here?
- In the neighborhood.

494
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:05,263
Lunch break. Having coffee with Alex.

495
00:19:05,287 --> 00:19:07,647
What are you doing in enemy territory?

496
00:19:09,072 --> 00:19:11,200
Wow. That's a beautiful tumor.

497
00:19:11,225 --> 00:19:12,694
Are you taking this out?

498
00:19:12,719 --> 00:19:14,160
I wish, but, no.

499
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,698
I can't do it.

500
00:19:15,723 --> 00:19:17,295
Is it too risky?

501
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,240
Please. I would destroy that thing.

502
00:19:19,264 --> 00:19:22,979
No, I can't do it because
it belongs to Richard's niece.

503
00:19:23,639 --> 00:19:24,834
And she doesn't want me to.

504
00:19:24,834 --> 00:19:26,753
We look so much alike we could be twins,

505
00:19:26,778 --> 00:19:28,698
which is, you know, surreal,

506
00:19:28,723 --> 00:19:30,782
but it's not more than I can handle.

507
00:19:30,807 --> 00:19:33,658
But she thinks it would be like
getting cut into by herself.

508
00:19:33,659 --> 00:19:35,509
I had a dream like that once.

509
00:19:35,534 --> 00:19:38,356
- Not good.
- What are we all doing here?

510
00:19:38,381 --> 00:19:39,606
- Alex.
- Patient.

511
00:19:39,631 --> 00:19:41,038
What patient?

512
00:19:42,687 --> 00:19:45,266
- Sexy.
- Yeah, I know.

513
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:46,863
I told Owen about the baby.

514
00:19:46,888 --> 00:19:49,190
Oh, that's why you're here.
I thought you were defecting.

515
00:19:49,215 --> 00:19:51,888
I told him about the baby,
and he got weird.

516
00:19:51,889 --> 00:19:54,051
That's understandable.

517
00:19:54,076 --> 00:19:55,475
Is it?

518
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:59,155
I mean, he's with Teddy, and he's happy.

519
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:00,857
And just now, he just seemed like

520
00:20:00,882 --> 00:20:03,669
he was angry with me for being pregnant.

521
00:20:03,694 --> 00:20:04,955
But he's gotta get with the program.

522
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:07,191
This kid is gonna be Leo's
little brother or sister.

523
00:20:07,191 --> 00:20:10,083
So he and Teddy are gonna be...

524
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:11,680
aunt and uncle, I guess?

525
00:20:11,705 --> 00:20:13,590
Does Leo call Teddy "Mom"?

526
00:20:13,615 --> 00:20:15,812
No, no, he calls her "Weddy"

527
00:20:15,837 --> 00:20:17,742
because he's working on his T's.

528
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:20,222
Oh, I get the question.

529
00:20:20,247 --> 00:20:23,092
Uh, I'm... Auntie Amelia.

530
00:20:23,093 --> 00:20:24,942
Betty's more like big sister.

531
00:20:24,967 --> 00:20:28,345
So Teddy's... stepmom, I guess?

532
00:20:31,725 --> 00:20:32,742
Damn it.

533
00:20:32,767 --> 00:20:34,721
Sabi's crashing. Here.

534
00:20:36,899 --> 00:20:38,541
Sabi is...?

535
00:20:38,566 --> 00:20:41,265
Her patient. And Richard's niece.

536
00:20:41,795 --> 00:20:43,923
- Oh, damn.
- Yeah.

537
00:20:45,419 --> 00:20:48,064
You know, Owen can be pissed
at me... I don't care...

538
00:20:48,718 --> 00:20:50,566
but he can't take it out on a patient.

539
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:52,866
Do you want any...?

540
00:20:54,696 --> 00:20:56,442
Everybody's got a patient.

541
00:20:56,467 --> 00:20:57,623
I want a patient.

542
00:20:57,648 --> 00:20:59,116
What happened?

543
00:20:59,141 --> 00:21:00,401
She just stopped talking...

544
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:01,963
She went into respiratory distress.

545
00:21:01,988 --> 00:21:04,463
I had to intubate.

546
00:21:04,488 --> 00:21:06,432
The tumor is obstructing
blood flow to her lungs.

547
00:21:06,457 --> 00:21:08,515
Let's push fluids and start pressors.

548
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:10,519
- Where's my sub?
- He's in the parking lot.

549
00:21:10,544 --> 00:21:12,568
But I didn't want him operating.

550
00:21:12,593 --> 00:21:13,853
This is all you.

551
00:21:13,878 --> 00:21:15,381
I'm glad you came to your senses.

552
00:21:15,406 --> 00:21:17,395
Prep an OR! Let's get her ready to move!

553
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:18,992
Wait. I didn't say you could.

554
00:21:19,017 --> 00:21:20,207
You're not supposed to operate.

555
00:21:20,232 --> 00:21:21,943
I haven't even talked
to the other doctor.

556
00:21:21,968 --> 00:21:23,992
I know you say I always think
I know what's best.

557
00:21:24,017 --> 00:21:25,726
Well, in this case, I do.

558
00:21:26,834 --> 00:21:28,961
I know Margaret Pierce.

559
00:21:28,986 --> 00:21:30,663
And there's not a surgeon in this city

560
00:21:30,688 --> 00:21:33,337
with half of her skill and expertise.

561
00:21:33,362 --> 00:21:35,489
Chris, please.

562
00:21:35,514 --> 00:21:38,545
Don't put your daughter's life
in someone else's hands.

563
00:21:41,742 --> 00:21:45,137
- Thank you.
- I'm sorry. I should've said it sooner.

564
00:21:45,741 --> 00:21:47,522
All right, come on, let's move. Move!

565
00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:01,289
Hey, you look like someone
I used to work with.

566
00:22:01,314 --> 00:22:04,482
Thank you for letting me do this.

567
00:22:04,507 --> 00:22:07,261
Hello, everyone. I'm Maggie Pierce.

568
00:22:07,286 --> 00:22:10,768
I'm Chief of Cardiothoracic
at Grey-Sloan Memorial.

569
00:22:10,793 --> 00:22:12,831
Don't hold that against me.

570
00:22:12,856 --> 00:22:14,324
Who is ready to take on

571
00:22:14,349 --> 00:22:17,345
the biggest biatrial myxoma

572
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:19,393
- I have ever seen?
- This isn't gonna work

573
00:22:19,418 --> 00:22:21,477
if she doesn't know everyone's listening.

574
00:22:21,502 --> 00:22:24,637
All right! That's better.

575
00:22:24,662 --> 00:22:26,106
Okay, folks, best behavior.

576
00:22:26,131 --> 00:22:28,189
If we impress Pierce, she just might come

577
00:22:28,214 --> 00:22:30,052
and run cardio for us.

578
00:22:31,186 --> 00:22:32,863
You know that's never
gonna happen, right?

579
00:22:32,888 --> 00:22:34,564
You'd be surprised
how many times it's worked.

580
00:22:34,589 --> 00:22:35,838
Hmm.

581
00:22:36,575 --> 00:22:38,634
Shout if you need anything.

582
00:22:40,464 --> 00:22:41,724
Scalpel.

583
00:23:02,527 --> 00:23:05,284
I'm sorry if I raised my voice earlier.

584
00:23:06,528 --> 00:23:08,725
Maggie really is the best there is.

585
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:11,040
Sabi couldn't be in better hands.

586
00:23:11,424 --> 00:23:13,760
Last time you tried to calm
my nerves in a waiting room,

587
00:23:13,785 --> 00:23:15,419
Mom died.

588
00:23:15,495 --> 00:23:17,645
I was 10 years old, Chris.

589
00:23:23,364 --> 00:23:25,144
No signal here.

590
00:23:25,169 --> 00:23:26,730
I need to call the family.

591
00:23:26,755 --> 00:23:28,102
Dr. Sykes...

592
00:23:28,127 --> 00:23:29,908
Dr. Jennifer Sykes, call Recovery.

593
00:23:29,933 --> 00:23:31,596
Dr. Sykes, call Recovery.

594
00:23:35,127 --> 00:23:38,435
Hey, Richard. What's wrong?

595
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:41,664
- N-Not now, Gemma, please.
- Oh, we go back too far back

596
00:23:41,689 --> 00:23:44,131
for me to leave you alone
looking like this.

597
00:23:44,156 --> 00:23:46,666
What is it? You need a meeting?

598
00:23:46,691 --> 00:23:48,160
Um...

599
00:23:48,185 --> 00:23:51,945
Maggie's operating on my niece right now.

600
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:55,070
She came out here
for the first time in years.

601
00:23:55,095 --> 00:23:56,355
Her father, too.

602
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:57,598
For my help.

603
00:23:57,623 --> 00:24:00,411
I thought they wanted
nothing to do with Maggie.

604
00:24:00,436 --> 00:24:02,258
My brother and sister, yes, but...

605
00:24:02,925 --> 00:24:05,990
Sabi, she's not like them.

606
00:24:06,015 --> 00:24:07,726
She's welcoming

607
00:24:07,751 --> 00:24:10,643
and forgiving

608
00:24:10,668 --> 00:24:13,185
and kind...

609
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:15,604
and I turned my back on her.

610
00:24:16,829 --> 00:24:19,339
Family's complicated.

611
00:24:19,364 --> 00:24:21,179
I know. I keep saying that.

612
00:24:21,204 --> 00:24:23,737
But I feel like it's just an excuse now.

613
00:24:24,918 --> 00:24:28,470
You made a sincere attempt at amends.

614
00:24:28,495 --> 00:24:30,477
If the other person
doesn't want to hear it,

615
00:24:30,502 --> 00:24:31,790
that's not on you.

616
00:24:31,815 --> 00:24:34,776
They aren't wrong.

617
00:24:34,854 --> 00:24:36,322
I did think I was better.

618
00:24:36,347 --> 00:24:38,706
Or at least knew better.

619
00:24:40,174 --> 00:24:43,621
You know, I never understood
why they were so content

620
00:24:43,646 --> 00:24:45,801
staying in their small, little world.

621
00:24:46,598 --> 00:24:48,135
You know what Chris said to me

622
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,930
when I told him I was an alcoholic?

623
00:24:51,076 --> 00:24:53,058
"That's what you get."

624
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:56,603
Like ambition was to blame.

625
00:24:56,628 --> 00:24:58,373
Like everything would've been fine

626
00:24:58,398 --> 00:25:01,692
if I hadn't gotten
a big head and left home.

627
00:25:03,011 --> 00:25:04,792
I'm sorry, Richard.

628
00:25:13,661 --> 00:25:15,122
Richard?

629
00:25:15,989 --> 00:25:17,109
Catherine.

630
00:25:17,134 --> 00:25:19,921
Uh, oh, well, this is Gemma.

631
00:25:19,946 --> 00:25:21,936
Uh, she's a friend.

632
00:25:21,961 --> 00:25:23,297
I can see that.

633
00:25:23,322 --> 00:25:25,207
It's so good to meet you, Catherine.

634
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:28,344
I've heard a-a lot about you, and, um...

635
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:31,862
- Well, I'll let... I'll let you two be.
- Yeah.

636
00:25:35,394 --> 00:25:37,348
Um...

637
00:25:37,373 --> 00:25:39,675
I wasn't sure you'd come.

638
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:41,591
Of course I came.

639
00:25:41,616 --> 00:25:42,945
It's family.

640
00:25:44,429 --> 00:25:46,001
Vanessa's making calls.

641
00:25:46,026 --> 00:25:47,703
Starting a prayer chain.

642
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,039
Oh, uh, Catherine, you remember Chris.

643
00:25:51,064 --> 00:25:54,441
Of course.
Chris, you must be worried sick.

644
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,769
Once we go on bypass,

645
00:26:00,794 --> 00:26:03,928
I'll make my incision
into the right atrium.

646
00:26:03,953 --> 00:26:05,838
What's her activated clotting time?

647
00:26:05,863 --> 00:26:08,365
ACT shows 300 seconds and rising.

648
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:09,519
That's good enough to start.

649
00:26:09,544 --> 00:26:11,706
Let's go on pump.

650
00:26:13,676 --> 00:26:15,525
Clamps off.

651
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:16,776
Clamp.

652
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:22,540
And so how is Vanessa?

653
00:26:22,565 --> 00:26:23,928
Is she still in that house?

654
00:26:23,953 --> 00:26:25,803
She'll never leave that house.

655
00:26:25,828 --> 00:26:27,053
I did some work for her.

656
00:26:27,078 --> 00:26:28,373
I added a sunroom in the back.

657
00:26:28,398 --> 00:26:30,040
Oh, that sounds lovely.

658
00:26:30,065 --> 00:26:32,747
And the, uh... the... the hardware store?

659
00:26:32,772 --> 00:26:34,762
- It closed last month.
- Oh.

660
00:26:34,787 --> 00:26:36,220
Everyone orders online now.

661
00:26:36,245 --> 00:26:38,060
It closed?

662
00:26:38,085 --> 00:26:39,623
No one told me that.

663
00:26:39,648 --> 00:26:41,324
You didn't ask.

664
00:26:43,155 --> 00:26:45,595
So, uh, when was the last time

665
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:48,268
you all came to visit Seattle?

666
00:26:48,293 --> 00:26:52,261
Well, um, Sabi couldn't have
been more than... what... 8?

667
00:26:52,286 --> 00:26:54,172
Hmm.

668
00:26:54,197 --> 00:26:56,810
W-What was that game
she always wanted to play?

669
00:26:56,835 --> 00:26:57,921
Um...

670
00:26:57,946 --> 00:26:59,484
Papa Never Misses!

671
00:26:59,509 --> 00:27:00,699
The little ones would line up

672
00:27:00,724 --> 00:27:02,817
on one side of the yard,
Chris on the other.

673
00:27:02,842 --> 00:27:04,693
And they would throw him a football

674
00:27:04,718 --> 00:27:06,602
as crazy as they could.

675
00:27:06,627 --> 00:27:10,629
I mean, they would fling it,
and flip it, and spin it.

676
00:27:10,654 --> 00:27:12,540
They'd try everything to make him miss,

677
00:27:12,565 --> 00:27:13,824
and he never did.

678
00:27:13,849 --> 00:27:14,866
Not once.

679
00:27:14,891 --> 00:27:15,907
Papa Never Misses.

680
00:27:17,252 --> 00:27:19,172
Sabi came close a few times, though.

681
00:27:19,197 --> 00:27:22,921
Yeah, I remember once
we had a kiddie pool set up,

682
00:27:22,946 --> 00:27:25,371
and Sabi would fill
a little pail of water

683
00:27:25,372 --> 00:27:27,396
and pour it over her cousins' heads,

684
00:27:27,421 --> 00:27:29,652
and they would laugh.

685
00:27:29,677 --> 00:27:31,527
But then, one time, my... my nephew...

686
00:27:31,552 --> 00:27:34,514
W-Was that... Was it Eddie,
Jeffrey, or...?

687
00:27:34,539 --> 00:27:36,562
- It was Eddie.
- Yeah, okay.

688
00:27:36,587 --> 00:27:39,201
Her cousin Eddie poured a pail of water

689
00:27:39,226 --> 00:27:40,798
- over Sabi's head.
- Oh.

690
00:27:40,823 --> 00:27:42,881
Oh, she burst into tears.

691
00:27:42,906 --> 00:27:45,069
She came running to me. She said...

692
00:27:45,094 --> 00:27:49,895
"Uncle Richard,

693
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:52,778
tell Eddie we don't play like that!"

694
00:27:55,996 --> 00:27:58,253
- Oh, boy.
- That's Sabi.

695
00:27:58,278 --> 00:28:00,649
Adele loved that story.

696
00:28:10,228 --> 00:28:12,296
You got a vending machine around here?

697
00:28:12,321 --> 00:28:14,345
Oh, yeah, down the hall.

698
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:15,525
Oh, you need some cash?

699
00:28:18,161 --> 00:28:20,429
I can afford a soda, Rich.

700
00:28:28,156 --> 00:28:30,422
Everything I say pisses that man off.

701
00:28:30,447 --> 00:28:32,055
Mm-hmm.

702
00:28:34,372 --> 00:28:37,090
Okay, look, I don't know what
you think you saw, but...

703
00:28:37,115 --> 00:28:38,752
We will talk about that later.

704
00:28:38,777 --> 00:28:41,703
There is nothing to talk about,
Catherine.

705
00:28:41,728 --> 00:28:44,030
Gemma is an accountant here.

706
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:46,113
A friend from the program.

707
00:28:46,138 --> 00:28:48,857
A while back, she needed a job,
I made some calls.

708
00:28:48,882 --> 00:28:50,974
It was before I even worked here.

709
00:28:50,999 --> 00:28:53,093
I've known her for years.

710
00:28:53,118 --> 00:28:55,442
She was concerned, and that's all.

711
00:28:55,826 --> 00:28:58,162
You're talking an awful lot
for someone who says

712
00:28:58,187 --> 00:29:00,836
there's nothing to talk about.

713
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:04,626
I need some fresh air.

714
00:29:11,989 --> 00:29:13,839
Doctors made Mommy all better, Bub.

715
00:29:13,864 --> 00:29:15,714
I'm so sorry I scared you.

716
00:29:15,739 --> 00:29:17,276
I love you so much.

717
00:29:17,301 --> 00:29:19,985
And when I'm all better,
we're gonna go to the zoo.

718
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:21,408
Can we see the baby giraffes?

719
00:29:21,433 --> 00:29:22,832
Yes, anything you want.

720
00:29:22,857 --> 00:29:25,193
Okay? But right now, Mommy's
got to rest a little bit.

721
00:29:25,218 --> 00:29:26,721
All right?

722
00:29:33,727 --> 00:29:35,751
I got so lucky with Henry.

723
00:29:35,776 --> 00:29:37,437
He's such a good kid...

724
00:29:37,437 --> 00:29:39,461
You know, he's so happy, even
with the little I can give him,

725
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:41,579
and he does not deserve less.

726
00:29:41,604 --> 00:29:43,316
Of course not.

727
00:29:43,341 --> 00:29:46,225
And you don't have to explain
that to anyone.

728
00:29:46,225 --> 00:29:47,484
It is your decision,

729
00:29:47,509 --> 00:29:49,985
even if you didn't have Henry
or money problems.

730
00:29:53,309 --> 00:29:55,991
All right, Cassidy, the doctors
said the labs and imaging

731
00:29:56,016 --> 00:29:59,221
showed an eight-week pregnancy,
so you're all clear.

732
00:29:59,246 --> 00:30:01,026
Okay, so that's it? It's just the pill?

733
00:30:01,051 --> 00:30:02,485
Two pills, actually.

734
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:04,603
You'll take one medication now
to block the hormones

735
00:30:04,628 --> 00:30:05,957
that keep the pregnancy viable,

736
00:30:05,981 --> 00:30:07,589
then a second pill in 24 hours

737
00:30:07,614 --> 00:30:09,318
to help contract the uterus.

738
00:30:09,319 --> 00:30:11,308
You'll feel nauseated and crampy,

739
00:30:11,333 --> 00:30:14,051
probably emotional... because hormones.
Okay.

740
00:30:14,076 --> 00:30:16,516
And it will be difficult when
you're passing the tissue.

741
00:30:16,541 --> 00:30:18,565
A lot of doctors say
it's like a heavy period,

742
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:19,884
but it's more than that.

743
00:30:19,909 --> 00:30:21,030
It's completely safe.

744
00:30:21,055 --> 00:30:22,975
I just want you to be prepared.

745
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,768
Thank you.

746
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:29,736
You'll need to schedule
an appointment with an OB

747
00:30:29,761 --> 00:30:31,126
in about a week or so

748
00:30:31,151 --> 00:30:32,792
to confirm that the medication worked

749
00:30:32,817 --> 00:30:34,667
and that there's no infection.

750
00:30:34,692 --> 00:30:36,820
Thank you. Thank you so much.

751
00:30:36,845 --> 00:30:39,216
I'm so grateful to both of you.

752
00:30:39,241 --> 00:30:41,785
Looks like Dr. Hunt is here
to do some post-op work,

753
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:43,278
so get some rest, Cassidy.

754
00:30:43,303 --> 00:30:45,778
And you have my card
if you need anything.

755
00:30:54,244 --> 00:30:56,477
Oh, hey.

756
00:30:56,502 --> 00:30:57,936
Any news?

757
00:30:57,961 --> 00:30:59,591
Still in surgery.

758
00:31:00,074 --> 00:31:02,375
- I'll say another prayer.
- Mm.

759
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:05,778
Richard tells me you're quite gifted.

760
00:31:05,803 --> 00:31:06,855
Pardon?

761
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,389
With numbers.
You work in accounting, right?

762
00:31:09,414 --> 00:31:11,820
- Oh. Yes.
- Mm.

763
00:31:11,845 --> 00:31:14,250
You know, at the Fox Foundation,
we're always looking

764
00:31:14,275 --> 00:31:16,230
for people we can trust

765
00:31:16,255 --> 00:31:18,667
- with our finances.
- Oh.

766
00:31:18,692 --> 00:31:20,507
There's a lot of opportunity.

767
00:31:20,532 --> 00:31:22,694
I'm sure it pays better than this place.

768
00:31:22,719 --> 00:31:25,333
You're too kind.

769
00:31:25,358 --> 00:31:27,764
Any friend of Richard's...

770
00:31:27,789 --> 00:31:29,778
Give him a rÃ©sumÃ©.

771
00:31:29,803 --> 00:31:31,514
Okay. Maybe I will.

772
00:31:31,539 --> 00:31:32,555
You should.

773
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:35,507
We have openings all over the country,

774
00:31:35,532 --> 00:31:38,355
though none here in Seattle, I'm afraid.

775
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:41,371
I should be getting back inside.

776
00:31:41,396 --> 00:31:42,585
Have a good night.

777
00:31:49,278 --> 00:31:52,912
Okay, I've dissected most of the tumor

778
00:31:52,937 --> 00:31:54,266
from the right atrium.

779
00:31:54,313 --> 00:31:55,607
Suction.

780
00:31:56,813 --> 00:31:57,899
MAPs are dropping.

781
00:31:57,924 --> 00:31:59,323
The bypass circuit is clotting off.

782
00:31:59,348 --> 00:32:00,503
Damn it, she's clotting.

783
00:32:00,528 --> 00:32:01,683
Why is she clotting?!

784
00:32:01,708 --> 00:32:03,456
What is her ACT now? 370 seconds.

785
00:32:03,456 --> 00:32:04,716
What?!

786
00:32:04,741 --> 00:32:07,390
You said it was 300 and rising
before we started.

787
00:32:07,415 --> 00:32:09,507
It should be over 480 by now.

788
00:32:09,532 --> 00:32:10,931
We could've given her more heparin.

789
00:32:10,956 --> 00:32:12,736
She's been dosed multiple times
with heparin.

790
00:32:12,761 --> 00:32:14,403
Why didn't you tell me
she had stopped rising?

791
00:32:14,428 --> 00:32:16,001
Our cardio doctor always asks.

792
00:32:16,026 --> 00:32:17,910
It's protocol. You never asked.

793
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:19,691
Okay, she's heparin-resistant.

794
00:32:19,716 --> 00:32:21,461
Her blood doesn't clot like normal.

795
00:32:21,486 --> 00:32:23,128
Her pressure's gone.

796
00:32:23,153 --> 00:32:24,968
Okay, everyone stop and listen to me!

797
00:32:24,993 --> 00:32:26,739
We have three minutes
before we lose this patient

798
00:32:26,764 --> 00:32:27,989
from lack of blood flow.

799
00:32:28,014 --> 00:32:30,107
We need a new bypass machine and pumps,

800
00:32:30,132 --> 00:32:31,601
ice to keep her body cool,

801
00:32:31,601 --> 00:32:32,966
and start FFP.

802
00:32:32,991 --> 00:32:34,528
Let's move! Clamps!

803
00:32:40,317 --> 00:32:42,375
Come on. Come on.

804
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,486
Stay with me.

805
00:32:48,789 --> 00:32:51,635
Amelia. You crossed a line.

806
00:32:51,635 --> 00:32:53,590
She needed help
that you wouldn't give her.

807
00:32:53,614 --> 00:32:55,256
You don't work here.

808
00:32:55,281 --> 00:32:57,269
Well, from what I've heard,
most of the people who do

809
00:32:57,294 --> 00:32:58,980
lack the skill and sensitivity
that I have,

810
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:01,074
so you could just say thank you.

811
00:33:01,099 --> 00:33:02,984
Owen, did you really want
to force that poor mom

812
00:33:03,008 --> 00:33:05,241
to bring another human being
onto the planet against her will,

813
00:33:05,266 --> 00:33:07,080
or did you refuse her an abortion

814
00:33:07,105 --> 00:33:08,817
because I wanted to help her have one?

815
00:33:08,842 --> 00:33:10,310
You don't get to come to my place of work

816
00:33:10,334 --> 00:33:11,733
and order me around, okay?

817
00:33:13,469 --> 00:33:15,492
I didn't order you around.

818
00:33:15,517 --> 00:33:18,167
I ordered her an OB
who ordered her some pills!

819
00:33:18,192 --> 00:33:21,534
And you're angry with me for
reasons I can't quite ascertain.

820
00:33:21,559 --> 00:33:24,313
So you said no to her because I said yes.

821
00:33:24,338 --> 00:33:25,903
I said no to her because...

822
00:33:25,904 --> 00:33:27,442
'cause sometimes
people change their minds,

823
00:33:27,467 --> 00:33:28,831
and she was traumatized by a fall.

824
00:33:28,856 --> 00:33:30,358
A fall that she took accidentally

825
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:32,580
after intentionally trying
to abort the fetus.

826
00:33:32,605 --> 00:33:35,809
You think that the trauma would
change her mind?

827
00:33:35,834 --> 00:33:38,132
Is this about me?!
Is this because I'm pregnant?

828
00:33:38,133 --> 00:33:40,434
So you think that women who say
that they don't want babies

829
00:33:40,459 --> 00:33:43,421
are gonna just wake up one day
and change their minds?

830
00:33:44,284 --> 00:33:45,579
Amelia, that's absurd.

831
00:33:45,604 --> 00:33:47,038
I agree. She was clear.

832
00:33:47,063 --> 00:33:48,322
She knew what she wanted.

833
00:33:48,347 --> 00:33:49,746
She was not gonna change her mind.

834
00:33:49,771 --> 00:33:52,281
And for the record, I did not
change my mind, either.

835
00:33:52,306 --> 00:33:55,266
I... I just got pregnant, and I exercised

836
00:33:55,291 --> 00:33:57,385
my freedom of choice to not
have an abortion.

837
00:33:57,386 --> 00:33:58,837
That's right. So you didn't want
to have kids,

838
00:33:58,862 --> 00:34:00,191
but now you're with
somebody else, and you do.

839
00:34:00,216 --> 00:34:01,476
Y-You're... You're perfectly happy

840
00:34:01,501 --> 00:34:03,942
now that you're having a baby
with another man!

841
00:34:04,276 --> 00:34:06,856
You and I broke up twice.

842
00:34:06,881 --> 00:34:10,050
- Once when we got divorced and then...
- Yeah. Yeah, we got divorced.

843
00:34:10,075 --> 00:34:11,619
You remember why we got divorced?

844
00:34:11,644 --> 00:34:13,077
You remember the pain
that you put me through

845
00:34:13,102 --> 00:34:14,928
when you told me that you
didn't want to ever have kids?

846
00:34:14,953 --> 00:34:17,151
That you didn't want to ever be a mother?

847
00:34:17,176 --> 00:34:19,082
That pain, that "truth," Amelia, it...

848
00:34:20,489 --> 00:34:22,132
It ended our marriage.

849
00:34:22,157 --> 00:34:23,520
And now you're telling me
that it's not because

850
00:34:23,545 --> 00:34:25,257
you didn't want to have kids, you just...

851
00:34:27,497 --> 00:34:29,799
You didn't want to have them with me.

852
00:34:32,185 --> 00:34:33,862
Owen.

853
00:34:40,562 --> 00:34:42,864
Uh, I gotta, um...

854
00:34:49,196 --> 00:34:52,088
Amelia. Amelia, wait. Wait.

855
00:34:52,113 --> 00:34:53,130
Owen.

856
00:34:53,155 --> 00:34:55,035
I'm sorry.

857
00:34:55,898 --> 00:34:58,204
It's my turn to apologize.

858
00:34:59,265 --> 00:35:01,081
I should have thought this through.

859
00:35:01,106 --> 00:35:02,747
I should not have ambushed you

860
00:35:02,772 --> 00:35:04,171
at your place of employment.

861
00:35:04,196 --> 00:35:05,594
I should've known that this was gonna be

862
00:35:05,619 --> 00:35:08,742
a bigger conversation, and I'm sorry.

863
00:35:14,231 --> 00:35:17,182
When I told you
that I didn't want kids...

864
00:35:18,415 --> 00:35:20,057
I didn't.

865
00:35:20,082 --> 00:35:22,591
I didn't when we started seeing
each other and you had Leo.

866
00:35:22,616 --> 00:35:24,084
I didn't when Betty showed up.

867
00:35:24,109 --> 00:35:26,133
If I'm honest,
I didn't even know for sure

868
00:35:26,158 --> 00:35:28,204
when I found out I was pregnant.

869
00:35:29,699 --> 00:35:31,932
But something changed.

870
00:35:31,957 --> 00:35:34,535
What we went through with Leo and Betty

871
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,272
is a big part of that.

872
00:35:36,297 --> 00:35:38,119
I wasn't ready before.

873
00:35:39,144 --> 00:35:40,580
I am now.

874
00:35:41,443 --> 00:35:44,010
And I have you to thank for that.

875
00:35:46,256 --> 00:35:48,338
Like it or not, we're family now.

876
00:35:49,245 --> 00:35:50,458
I like it.

877
00:35:53,122 --> 00:35:54,937
I always liked it.

878
00:36:02,671 --> 00:36:04,347
Mm.

879
00:36:04,372 --> 00:36:07,842
So, okay, how are we gonna do
this whole family thing?

880
00:36:07,867 --> 00:36:09,232
'Cause there's a lot of us.

881
00:36:09,257 --> 00:36:13,433
There's me, Teddy, you, Link,
Leo, Allison, and...

882
00:36:13,458 --> 00:36:15,378
- you got a name yet?
- Uh...

883
00:36:15,403 --> 00:36:17,321
W-We literally have nothing.

884
00:36:17,346 --> 00:36:18,537
And I don't know how this works.

885
00:36:18,562 --> 00:36:19,787
I mean, there should be a book...

886
00:36:19,812 --> 00:36:21,697
Like, "What to Expect
When You're Expecting,

887
00:36:21,722 --> 00:36:24,753
But You Already Sort of Have
an Adopted Kid with Your Ex..."

888
00:36:24,778 --> 00:36:27,359
"...Who Just Had a Baby
with His, uh, Soul Mate."

889
00:36:27,384 --> 00:36:30,068
Sounds like a bestseller.

890
00:36:37,041 --> 00:36:39,829
I was really terrible
with my patient, so I should...

891
00:36:39,854 --> 00:36:43,518
Yeah, you should bring her
an extra Jell-O, for sure.

892
00:36:44,863 --> 00:36:46,677
Maybe one for Henry.

893
00:36:46,702 --> 00:36:48,379
Yeah.

894
00:36:59,392 --> 00:37:01,450
Is this normal?

895
00:37:01,475 --> 00:37:03,012
For it to take this long?

896
00:37:03,037 --> 00:37:05,235
Uh, you don't want to rush
something like this.

897
00:37:08,208 --> 00:37:09,780
I can't imagine
what you're going through.

898
00:37:09,805 --> 00:37:12,142
No, you can't.

899
00:37:12,167 --> 00:37:13,794
Look, what I mean was that...

900
00:37:15,454 --> 00:37:17,927
I've only known Maggie a few years.

901
00:37:18,351 --> 00:37:21,277
But in that time,
I've grown to care about her

902
00:37:21,302 --> 00:37:23,846
more than any person I've ever known.

903
00:37:23,871 --> 00:37:25,548
I worry about her future,

904
00:37:25,573 --> 00:37:28,283
her safety, her happiness.

905
00:37:28,296 --> 00:37:31,153
If I loved her any more...

906
00:37:31,178 --> 00:37:32,855
...I'm not sure I could bear it.

907
00:37:34,372 --> 00:37:37,819
And it's a fraction of what
you must be feeling right now.

908
00:37:39,238 --> 00:37:40,806
I'm sorry.

909
00:37:54,376 --> 00:37:56,990
It's all clotted! Everything has clotted!

910
00:37:57,015 --> 00:37:59,059
Suction! Start the pump!

911
00:37:59,084 --> 00:38:00,900
I'm trying. Still no flow.

912
00:38:00,925 --> 00:38:03,156
We need to get oxygen to her brain!

913
00:38:03,181 --> 00:38:04,407
How long has the circuit been down?

914
00:38:04,432 --> 00:38:05,865
I can get her back! I can.

915
00:38:05,890 --> 00:38:07,219
- How long?
- Seven minutes.

916
00:38:07,244 --> 00:38:08,857
I connected bypass in time.

917
00:38:08,882 --> 00:38:11,218
There's just too many clots.
We need some more ice!

918
00:38:11,243 --> 00:38:12,538
We need to cool her down some more.

919
00:38:12,563 --> 00:38:13,683
Nuce, seven minutes is too long.

920
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:15,385
We can get her back! We can get her back!

921
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:17,122
Her entire circulation has clotted off.

922
00:38:17,147 --> 00:38:18,614
There's no way she can recover from that.

923
00:38:18,639 --> 00:38:20,003
- Come on.
- All right? She's gone.

924
00:38:20,028 --> 00:38:22,260
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Okay, everybody stop!

925
00:38:22,285 --> 00:38:24,170
Not yet, Alex. Not yet.

926
00:38:24,195 --> 00:38:25,455
- Maggie...
- No, no!

927
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:27,573
...she's brain dead. Let her go.

928
00:38:36,383 --> 00:38:38,338
Time of death, 18:58.

929
00:39:11,053 --> 00:39:13,285
- I can't do this.
- I'll be with you.

930
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:15,770
No, no, no, Alex,
I can't do this. I can't.

931
00:39:15,795 --> 00:39:17,263
I can't. I can't. They... They...

932
00:39:17,288 --> 00:39:19,763
They didn't want me to operate.

933
00:39:19,788 --> 00:39:22,298
They told me not to, and I pushed them.

934
00:39:22,323 --> 00:39:24,485
I bullied them.

935
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:26,013
I told them I was the best.

936
00:39:26,038 --> 00:39:27,124
You are.

937
00:39:27,149 --> 00:39:29,659
Alex, I-I can't... I can't tell them.

938
00:39:29,684 --> 00:39:32,148
Come on.

939
00:39:38,871 --> 00:39:40,999
You lost your patient.

940
00:39:41,024 --> 00:39:42,701
You tried to do all the right things,

941
00:39:42,726 --> 00:39:44,854
but you lost your patient.

942
00:39:44,879 --> 00:39:46,277
And you're blaming yourself, and...

943
00:39:46,302 --> 00:39:48,912
and I can't make you not feel that.

944
00:39:49,111 --> 00:39:51,239
But you have to tell them.

945
00:39:51,264 --> 00:39:54,364
So just stand here, get it
all out of your system,

946
00:39:54,389 --> 00:39:56,878
and then pull yourself
back together again.

947
00:39:57,535 --> 00:39:58,922
Get it out.

948
00:40:09,123 --> 00:40:11,768
Grace under pressure.

949
00:40:11,835 --> 00:40:15,005
One clumsy word, one careless gesture

950
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:17,227
can cause irreparable harm.

951
00:40:35,647 --> 00:40:37,289
H-How is she?

952
00:40:37,314 --> 00:40:38,817
Is she okay?

953
00:40:38,842 --> 00:40:40,396
Can I see her?

954
00:40:42,621 --> 00:40:44,124
I'm Alex Karev. I'm the Chief.

955
00:40:44,149 --> 00:40:45,478
Would you, uh, like to sit down?

956
00:40:45,503 --> 00:40:47,493
I'm fine standing.

957
00:40:47,917 --> 00:40:49,597
So, focus on facts.

958
00:40:49,622 --> 00:40:50,951
What happened?

959
00:40:50,976 --> 00:40:53,728
What was the problem,
and what did you do?

960
00:40:53,753 --> 00:40:55,847
Don't make it personal.

961
00:40:55,872 --> 00:40:58,208
During surgery, we discovered

962
00:40:58,233 --> 00:41:01,923
that Sabrina has a resistance to heparin,

963
00:41:01,948 --> 00:41:03,462
- so her blood...
- W-What's that?

964
00:41:03,487 --> 00:41:04,504
W-What's heparin?

965
00:41:04,529 --> 00:41:06,781
Uh, it's a drug to prevent clotting.

966
00:41:08,213 --> 00:41:10,271
Which didn't work for her.

967
00:41:10,296 --> 00:41:14,194
So during surgery,
her blood began to clot,

968
00:41:14,219 --> 00:41:16,451
and that clogged the bypass machine,

969
00:41:16,476 --> 00:41:20,652
which meant we had to
change machines mid-surgery.

970
00:41:20,677 --> 00:41:22,505
I-I don't understand.

971
00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:24,138
So you had to stop?

972
00:41:24,168 --> 00:41:25,323
Is she okay?

973
00:41:25,348 --> 00:41:27,441
Answer questions directly.

974
00:41:27,466 --> 00:41:29,906
This is not your loss.

975
00:41:29,931 --> 00:41:31,531
This is not your pain.

976
00:41:31,786 --> 00:41:33,602
Never make it about you.

977
00:41:33,627 --> 00:41:35,893
Sabrina's condition was critical

978
00:41:35,918 --> 00:41:39,480
before we ever got to the operating room.

979
00:41:40,344 --> 00:41:43,408
I did everything that I could,

980
00:41:43,433 --> 00:41:44,861
but, unfortunately,

981
00:41:45,865 --> 00:41:48,062
I couldn't save her.

982
00:41:48,087 --> 00:41:50,658
She died.

983
00:41:51,558 --> 00:41:53,964
Oh, Maggie...

984
00:41:53,989 --> 00:41:56,603
No.

985
00:41:56,628 --> 00:41:57,888
No, no, no, no. no.

986
00:41:59,896 --> 00:42:01,461
Sabi?

987
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:05,337
No.

988
00:42:05,362 --> 00:42:08,358
And if there's no silver
lining, don't make one up.

989
00:42:08,383 --> 00:42:10,684
Your job isn't to make
the bad news sound better.

990
00:42:10,709 --> 00:42:12,663
- Chris, let's get you out of here.
- Get your hands off me!

991
00:42:12,688 --> 00:42:14,364
Okay, now.

992
00:42:14,389 --> 00:42:17,038
I didn't even want her to operate!

993
00:42:17,063 --> 00:42:19,200
Sabrina didn't!

994
00:42:20,614 --> 00:42:22,047
You didn't listen!

995
00:42:24,817 --> 00:42:26,147
Even though you're in pain, too...

996
00:42:28,263 --> 00:42:30,977
...even though you don't
feel like a doctor...

997
00:42:31,002 --> 00:42:33,076
Maggie, is... is she cleaned up?

998
00:42:33,101 --> 00:42:36,097
Can we see her?

999
00:42:36,122 --> 00:42:38,352
Come on, Richard. Richard, come on.
Get your brother.

1000
00:42:38,377 --> 00:42:41,876
We got to go help him call
the rest of the family.

1001
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:45,019
You're just another person, alone,

1002
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:46,628
falling into the dark.
