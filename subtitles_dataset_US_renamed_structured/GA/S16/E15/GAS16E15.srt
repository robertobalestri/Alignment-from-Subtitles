00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:52,646
- but I still don't know where she...
- Find her!

168
00:05:52,787 --> 00:05:55,435
While you're at it,
try and find my husband.

169
00:05:57,201 --> 00:06:00,944
Stupid. Cavalier. Cowboy.
Doesn't ever listen.

170
00:06:01,029 --> 00:06:02,535
- Maybe fired.
- All due respect, Chief,

171
00:06:02,619 --> 00:06:04,451
my patient will die
without that liver.

172
00:06:04,536 --> 00:06:06,304
DeLuca could save her.
It's only three miles away.

173
00:06:06,388 --> 00:06:07,575
Carina:
Have you been outside?

174
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:09,522
You can't even see three feet
ahead of you.

175
00:06:09,607 --> 00:06:11,075
Somebody needs to go
after him.

176
00:06:11,159 --> 00:06:13,030
What about Ben?
Can Ben send a rig out

177
00:06:13,115 --> 00:06:14,147
- and look for him?
- Yeah.

178
00:06:14,231 --> 00:06:15,828
He can get him to Seattle Pres
and get him back.

179
00:06:15,912 --> 00:06:18,553
Last time we spoke,
Ben was amputating a foot

180
00:06:18,638 --> 00:06:20,366
in a grounded rig.
So, no.

181
00:06:20,451 --> 00:06:22,115
Dr. Bailey, you asked me
to let you know

182
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:23,577
when I discharged
Joey Phillips.

183
00:06:23,662 --> 00:06:25,819
No, no!
In the middle of a blizzard?

184
00:06:25,904 --> 00:06:26,945
What's the matter with you?

185
00:06:27,029 --> 00:06:29,035
Sorry, there's no medical
reason to keep him.

186
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:31,054
All that's left is his dispo
with Social Services.

187
00:06:31,138 --> 00:06:32,841
He's free to go.

188
00:06:32,926 --> 00:06:34,987
Uh, and let me know
if there's an update.

189
00:06:35,072 --> 00:06:36,630
I'll call Andrea
every 15 minutes.

190
00:06:36,715 --> 00:06:38,608
Dr. Hayes, something's wrong!

191
00:06:38,692 --> 00:06:41,274
Baby? Elisa?
Honey, wake up.

192
00:06:41,369 --> 00:06:42,647
- Honey?
- Meredith: She's hemorrhaging.

193
00:06:42,731 --> 00:06:45,295
Let's hang some FFP and get
two units of blood in here.

194
00:06:45,636 --> 00:06:47,133
Damn it, she's unresponsive.

195
00:06:47,218 --> 00:06:49,264
- Oh, God.
- It's okay. It's okay. She's okay.

196
00:06:49,349 --> 00:06:50,825
Let's get an intubation tray
in here right now.

197
00:06:50,909 --> 00:06:52,927
Let's book an OR!

198
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:56,216
Ms. Gutierrez, how are we feeling today?

199
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:58,631
I called my neighbor,
Stevie,

200
00:06:58,716 --> 00:07:01,705
to check that the heat
is still on in my house

201
00:07:01,789 --> 00:07:05,445
so my cats are okay,
but I worry about the strays.

202
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:08,705
They don't have wings,
can't just fly south.

203
00:07:08,789 --> 00:07:10,785
You know, freezing to death
isn't supposed to be that bad.

204
00:07:12,659 --> 00:07:14,205
Uh, uh, people, uh,

205
00:07:14,289 --> 00:07:16,575
who have been resuscitated
said it was blissful.

206
00:07:16,659 --> 00:07:18,405
Ms. Gutierrez, if I may,

207
00:07:18,489 --> 00:07:21,124
I saw on TV that the animal
shelters are open 24/7.

208
00:07:21,209 --> 00:07:22,365
There's plenty of food.

209
00:07:22,449 --> 00:07:24,171
People can bring in
any animal that they find.

210
00:07:24,255 --> 00:07:25,945
- Even horses.
- Really?

211
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:28,035
Oh, that's nice.

212
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:29,764
Richard: Okay, then,
Ms. Gutierrez.

213
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:32,245
Someone will come
to bring you to pre-op soon.

214
00:07:34,341 --> 00:07:36,615
Hey, Desmond, meet me
in the scrub room.

215
00:07:36,855 --> 00:07:38,075
- Me?
- Her? Uh, I'm...

216
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,325
I'm supposed to assist, Dr. Webber.

217
00:07:39,409 --> 00:07:41,405
I remember. But I'm sure
the ER is slammed.

218
00:07:41,489 --> 00:07:42,655
They could use the help.

219
00:07:48,786 --> 00:07:50,170
Woman on TV: <i>The worst snowstorm</i>

220
00:07:50,255 --> 00:07:52,249
<i>we have ever seen in Seattle.</i>

221
00:07:52,334 --> 00:07:53,342
Woman #2 on TV:
<i>That's right...</i>

222
00:07:53,426 --> 00:07:54,553
Residents
around the region...

223
00:07:54,637 --> 00:07:57,093
I've never seen it
snow like this in Seattle.

224
00:07:57,193 --> 00:08:01,755
Mm, it's not supposed to, but
y'all ruined the planet so...

225
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:04,756
The social worker said

226
00:08:04,841 --> 00:08:07,952
that you declined to meet
with her about your options.

227
00:08:08,982 --> 00:08:10,655
Mm. I just turned 18.

228
00:08:10,739 --> 00:08:14,115
Which means you can apply
for extended foster care

229
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:16,530
- or go to a group home.
- Or go out on my own.

230
00:08:16,615 --> 00:08:18,686
Why take the chance on getting
crappy foster parents

231
00:08:18,771 --> 00:08:19,785
just in it for the money?

232
00:08:19,869 --> 00:08:24,945
Because you... you might
get a great family.

233
00:08:25,193 --> 00:08:28,443
People that can help you get
your high-school diploma,

234
00:08:28,537 --> 00:08:29,896
apply for college.

235
00:08:29,981 --> 00:08:32,624
- Uh, help you find
a career you love.

236
00:08:32,709 --> 00:08:34,444
- What?
- Oh. College?

237
00:08:34,529 --> 00:08:35,615
That'll never happen.

238
00:08:35,699 --> 00:08:36,943
I'll just get a job.

239
00:08:37,028 --> 00:08:38,819
There's always a sign
at a Burger Shack.

240
00:08:38,904 --> 00:08:40,654
Joey.

241
00:08:40,739 --> 00:08:42,982
Goodness.

242
00:08:43,536 --> 00:08:46,279
What...

243
00:08:47,074 --> 00:08:48,450
Come on.

244
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:50,170
You're coming with me.

245
00:08:50,255 --> 00:08:52,655
You are checking out
jobs around here.

246
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:54,490
I said, come on!

247
00:08:56,004 --> 00:08:57,178
Yes, ma'am.

248
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:06,255
Hey.
Have you seen my patient?

249
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:09,397
She's got brown hair
and maybe brownish eyes.

250
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:10,951
She's about, um...

251
00:09:11,329 --> 00:09:12,405
Well, I don't know
how tall she is.

252
00:09:12,489 --> 00:09:13,834
I... I've only
seen her in bed.

253
00:09:14,079 --> 00:09:16,445
Uh, no, but after you
find her,

254
00:09:16,529 --> 00:09:17,865
why don't we find
an on-call room?

255
00:09:17,949 --> 00:09:19,115
My hip replacement
rescheduled.

256
00:09:19,199 --> 00:09:20,905
Um, yeah, yeah, sure.

257
00:09:20,989 --> 00:09:22,155
May... Uh, maybe.

258
00:09:22,239 --> 00:09:23,445
What? Doesn't sound fun?

259
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:25,310
Might get snowed in,
make a night out of it.

260
00:09:25,395 --> 00:09:28,034
It does, but we've been
having a lot of fun lately.

261
00:09:28,119 --> 00:09:29,535
In fact, this might be
the most we've talked

262
00:09:29,619 --> 00:09:31,579
since you told me you
weren't out to your parents.

263
00:09:33,619 --> 00:09:36,224
I love you, Nico.
You can talk to me.

264
00:09:36,369 --> 00:09:38,575
You still
haven't found her?

265
00:09:38,659 --> 00:09:41,608
Schmitt, I know this job is hard,

266
00:09:41,693 --> 00:09:43,070
but you should be able
to follow basics like,

267
00:09:43,154 --> 00:09:45,655
don't let a severely
sick patient evaporate.

268
00:09:45,739 --> 00:09:48,326
If she isn't here,
you shouldn't be either.

269
00:09:51,449 --> 00:09:52,982
I have to find my patient.

270
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:56,967
Hey, more frostbite, bed 10.

271
00:09:57,052 --> 00:09:58,248
Of course there is.

272
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:00,389
Hey. So, Mom called.

273
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:01,365
Leo is stir-crazy.

274
00:10:01,449 --> 00:10:02,593
He keeps trying to open
the front door.

275
00:10:02,677 --> 00:10:05,035
But Allison rolled over.
Twice.

276
00:10:05,119 --> 00:10:07,825
No! Wait, did your mom record...
Oh, you know what?

277
00:10:07,909 --> 00:10:09,333
- I don't even know why I
bothered to ask. - Kendra: Help!

278
00:10:09,417 --> 00:10:11,389
Help me, please!
Please help!

279
00:10:11,474 --> 00:10:13,035
It's my wife...
She's not talking.

280
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:14,785
I don't think she's breathing. Okay,
just stop moving her. Stop.

281
00:10:14,869 --> 00:10:15,995
Let's lay her down.
I got her.

282
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:16,996
- Alright. Yep.
- Yeah.

283
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,496
- We need a gurney!
- Woman: <i>On it!</i>

284
00:10:18,581 --> 00:10:19,606
She's 32 weeks pregnant.

285
00:10:19,691 --> 00:10:21,081
Why's she hurt?
What happened?

286
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:22,832
I hit her with my car.

287
00:10:29,699 --> 00:10:32,476
Oh, my God. How far along?

288
00:10:32,561 --> 00:10:34,270
32 weeks. Page OB.

289
00:10:34,355 --> 00:10:35,927
Let's get the X-ray in here,
warm saline,

290
00:10:36,011 --> 00:10:37,754
and where's
the fetal heart monitor?

291
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:39,872
- Is she dead?
- We need to do a full exam.

292
00:10:39,956 --> 00:10:41,145
Kendra, are you hurt?

293
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:42,754
No, no, I'm just c-cold.

294
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:44,271
Alright, let's get her
a warming blanket.

295
00:10:44,355 --> 00:10:46,458
Her back's been hurting her,
and I was snowed in at work,

296
00:10:46,542 --> 00:10:47,716
and she called and said
that she was worried

297
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,017
that she might be having
contractions.

298
00:10:49,101 --> 00:10:51,326
And she wanted to come here.
We only live four blocks away.

299
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:53,160
- She was walking here?
- I told her not to go,

300
00:10:53,244 --> 00:10:54,410
but I-I got in my car.

301
00:10:54,495 --> 00:10:58,246
I was almost home, and that's
when I-I hit something.

302
00:10:58,331 --> 00:10:59,567
And I got out, and...

303
00:10:59,651 --> 00:11:02,067
I'm gonna be sick.
Whoa, whoa. Hey.

304
00:11:02,151 --> 00:11:04,621
Fetal heartbeat's strong.

305
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:05,902
- Tube's good.
- Kendra: I thought

306
00:11:05,986 --> 00:11:07,395
I was driving on the street.

307
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,590
I was on the sidewalk.

308
00:11:12,285 --> 00:11:14,864
Tess: ...and then,
under direct visualization,

309
00:11:14,949 --> 00:11:16,325
we remove the ports.

310
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:18,168
At which point we...

311
00:11:18,253 --> 00:11:19,887
Uh, deflate the abdomen

312
00:11:19,972 --> 00:11:22,285
and close the fascia
with U stitches.

313
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:26,739
Great.
So... you ready?

314
00:11:26,824 --> 00:11:28,926
Uh, why wouldn't
I be ready?

315
00:11:29,011 --> 00:11:30,972
Oh, my mistake.
I didn't realize

316
00:11:31,058 --> 00:11:33,981
that you had already
performed a lap chole.

317
00:11:34,104 --> 00:11:36,011
Performed one?
Of course not.

318
00:11:36,096 --> 00:11:38,356
Wait, you don't
want me to...

319
00:11:38,441 --> 00:11:39,707
No, I-I...

320
00:11:39,792 --> 00:11:40,848
I can't.
I'm not ready.

321
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:43,129
Do you know how many
of your classmates beg

322
00:11:43,214 --> 00:11:45,160
to do procedures
when they're not ready?

323
00:11:45,245 --> 00:11:47,105
By the way you formed
the question,

324
00:11:47,214 --> 00:11:48,614
I assume it's
a big number.

325
00:11:48,699 --> 00:11:50,645
I'm not gonna leave you
on your own, Desmond.

326
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:51,770
You'll be my hands,

327
00:11:51,855 --> 00:11:53,513
but I will guide you through
the whole thing,

328
00:11:53,597 --> 00:11:54,857
step by step.

329
00:11:58,435 --> 00:12:02,183
Have you ever wanted something
with your whole being,

330
00:12:02,535 --> 00:12:05,395
but there are so
many obstacles

331
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,910
it seems like you
won't get it?

332
00:12:06,995 --> 00:12:08,832
So you try to stop dreaming,

333
00:12:08,917 --> 00:12:10,910
but you can't make
yourself stop,

334
00:12:10,995 --> 00:12:15,687
so you just live with it,
quietly in hell?

335
00:12:15,863 --> 00:12:18,215
Let's show your classmates
what you're made of.

336
00:12:20,386 --> 00:12:23,215
Yeah. So, uh,
Ruben's a phlebotomist,

337
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:26,121
draws blood for lab work,
never leaves a bruise.

338
00:12:26,206 --> 00:12:29,106
And Pablo,
he's a respiratory therapist...

339
00:12:29,191 --> 00:12:31,647
He oversees ventilators
on patients

340
00:12:31,731 --> 00:12:35,753
and, um, helps them if they
have any lung issues. Right.

341
00:12:35,847 --> 00:12:37,668
So should you...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

342
00:12:37,753 --> 00:12:38,687
Schmitt! Slow down!

343
00:12:38,771 --> 00:12:40,993
Huh? What's the problem?
Uh, nothing. No problem.

344
00:12:41,078 --> 00:12:42,441
All good.

345
00:12:43,292 --> 00:12:44,687
I lost a patient.

346
00:12:45,105 --> 00:12:46,739
I mean, physically.
I can't find her.

347
00:12:48,271 --> 00:12:49,981
If this story doesn't
have a happy ending,

348
00:12:50,066 --> 00:12:51,825
neither will your career.
Understand?

349
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:53,871
Yep. I'm just gonna...

350
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:56,414
Can I have his job?

351
00:12:56,561 --> 00:12:58,067
Losing people?

352
00:12:58,152 --> 00:12:59,550
You're not funny.

353
00:13:00,378 --> 00:13:02,267
Hayes: Think this shunt
will stop the bleeding?

354
00:13:02,389 --> 00:13:04,802
Meredith: Well, it's our only
choice until the liver gets here.

355
00:13:04,886 --> 00:13:07,300
So, you were fired.

356
00:13:08,417 --> 00:13:09,857
And?

357
00:13:10,074 --> 00:13:13,098
And I never heard the full
story, and we have time to kill.

358
00:13:15,542 --> 00:13:17,980
I had a 4-year-old patient,

359
00:13:18,081 --> 00:13:20,307
and she did not have
health insurance,

360
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:22,981
so I put my daughter's name
on her paperwork

361
00:13:23,066 --> 00:13:25,691
- so that I could save her life.
- That's insane.

362
00:13:25,995 --> 00:13:27,536
Well, if you had seen
how sick she was...

363
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:29,410
No, this country's
medical system is insane

364
00:13:29,495 --> 00:13:31,216
that you had to do that.

365
00:13:31,464 --> 00:13:33,293
I'd do it for more people
if I could,

366
00:13:33,378 --> 00:13:35,647
but then they would definitely
take away my license.

367
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:39,270
Hmm. Never seen such an
early case of cirrhosis before.

368
00:13:39,355 --> 00:13:41,606
Alpha-1-Antitrypsin
deficiency.

369
00:13:41,691 --> 00:13:43,637
Elisa's older sister
died of the same thing.

370
00:13:43,722 --> 00:13:46,207
Family's first doctor diagnosed
it from the autopsy.

371
00:13:46,517 --> 00:13:47,917
O.R. Nurse:
That was Seattle Pres.

372
00:13:48,042 --> 00:13:49,684
Dr. DeLuca just left
with the donor organ.

373
00:13:49,769 --> 00:13:51,477
- On foot?
- No idea.

374
00:13:54,191 --> 00:13:55,887
Alpha-1-Antitrypsin
deficiency.

375
00:13:55,972 --> 00:13:57,473
Was their first doctor
Alex Karev?

376
00:13:57,558 --> 00:13:59,647
My absentee co-chief?
Yes, it was.

377
00:14:00,152 --> 00:14:03,114
I think I remember her.
She loved comic books.

378
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:05,410
He did a whole thing for her
on the PEDS floor.

379
00:14:05,495 --> 00:14:06,950
He was devastated
when she died.

380
00:14:07,035 --> 00:14:09,397
Well, not devastated enough
to come back and help Elisa.

381
00:14:09,481 --> 00:14:11,403
Yang spoke a lot
about Karev.

382
00:14:11,488 --> 00:14:13,060
She used to call him
the devil or something?

383
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:15,785
Evil Spawn.
0 Evil Spawn. That was it.

384
00:14:17,049 --> 00:14:18,777
What did Yang
say about me?

385
00:14:19,768 --> 00:14:21,476
Nothing that I can recall.

386
00:14:22,277 --> 00:14:23,691
Hmm.

387
00:14:46,152 --> 00:14:48,199
No.

388
00:14:48,419 --> 00:14:51,160
No, no, no, no, no, no!

389
00:14:51,245 --> 00:14:53,340
Stop! Everybody.
Oh, my God, stop.

390
00:14:53,425 --> 00:14:55,271
Schmitt?! What if we'd have
been in mid-dissection?

391
00:14:55,355 --> 00:14:56,826
You could've startled
Dr. Desmond so badly

392
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:58,309
she'd injure
the common bile duct.

393
00:14:58,394 --> 00:15:00,105
Dr. Desmond?
Who's that?

394
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:01,543
She may not have
been your year,

395
00:15:01,628 --> 00:15:03,779
but, Schmitt, that's no excuse
for not knowing who she is.

396
00:15:03,863 --> 00:15:06,262
That's my patient,
Tess Anderson!

397
00:15:07,601 --> 00:15:09,722
Your patient?
Now, that's absurd.

398
00:15:09,886 --> 00:15:11,147
I can explain.

399
00:15:11,231 --> 00:15:13,325
Am I, um, technically
a-a patient?

400
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:15,451
Yes. But you were the one
that brought me into the OR.

401
00:15:15,535 --> 00:15:17,052
I was just gonna stay
in the skills lab,

402
00:15:17,136 --> 00:15:19,267
but you told me to be
confident, and I also...

403
00:15:21,061 --> 00:15:22,543
Oh, not again!

404
00:15:22,628 --> 00:15:23,897
Ohh!

405
00:15:23,981 --> 00:15:25,472
Hey! Stop!

406
00:15:26,268 --> 00:15:27,824
God in heaven.

407
00:15:29,706 --> 00:15:31,401
Hey, Pierce!
Pierce, Pierce, here!

408
00:15:31,486 --> 00:15:33,417
I want you to meet,
uh, Joey Phillips.

409
00:15:33,502 --> 00:15:36,660
He is experiencing my version
of a career fair.

410
00:15:36,745 --> 00:15:39,004
Joey,
this is Dr. Maggie Pierce.

411
00:15:39,089 --> 00:15:41,973
Just like Avery,
she is chief of her own department,

412
00:15:42,058 --> 00:15:44,333
cardiothoracic surgery.
Well, technically, I'm cochief, right?

413
00:15:44,417 --> 00:15:47,075
I was the chief, but then
I kind of got demoted.

414
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:50,832
After you quit and got rehired
out of the goodness of my heart.

415
00:15:50,917 --> 00:15:54,582
Which is why it is such
an honor to be co-chief,

416
00:15:54,667 --> 00:15:55,903
and I'm so proud.

417
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:57,847
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Maggie. Mom's in P.E.A.

418
00:15:57,931 --> 00:15:59,637
Okay, come on, come on.

419
00:15:59,721 --> 00:16:02,426
Okay. We lost her pulse.
Did we get OB?

420
00:16:02,511 --> 00:16:04,317
They got swamped with
an abruption upstairs.

421
00:16:04,402 --> 00:16:05,395
Give me that ultrasound.

422
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,598
Bailey:
You know what, Joey?

423
00:16:06,683 --> 00:16:08,619
We should go check out
a calmer department.

424
00:16:08,704 --> 00:16:09,628
Is she gonna be okay?

425
00:16:09,713 --> 00:16:10,903
The rib must've
punctured her heart.

426
00:16:10,987 --> 00:16:12,434
Damn it.
Fetal heart rate's down to 80.

427
00:16:12,518 --> 00:16:13,636
I think we're out of time.

428
00:16:13,721 --> 00:16:15,636
Time for what?
Use words. You're not using words.

429
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,726
Am I losing them both?

430
00:16:16,811 --> 00:16:17,928
Bailey: I'm sorry,
what's your name?

431
00:16:18,012 --> 00:16:19,348
Kendra.
I'm Kendra.

432
00:16:19,433 --> 00:16:21,099
Kendra, okay, they need
to do a C-section.

433
00:16:21,184 --> 00:16:22,292
But she's only 32 weeks.

434
00:16:22,377 --> 00:16:24,800
Yeah, but her heart has been
stopped for too long,

435
00:16:24,885 --> 00:16:27,300
and if they don't deliver the
baby now, it'll be too late.

436
00:16:27,385 --> 00:16:29,253
And then they'll
help Lesley?

437
00:16:29,338 --> 00:16:30,464
Uh, I'm afraid...

438
00:16:30,549 --> 00:16:32,118
Let's get a lap
and a thoracotomy tray.

439
00:16:32,203 --> 00:16:33,887
We're gonna do a C-section
and a thoracotomy.

440
00:16:33,971 --> 00:16:36,066
- Both?
- Hunt, she will lose way too much blood.

441
00:16:36,151 --> 00:16:37,972
We can give her more.
We're saving them both.

442
00:16:38,057 --> 00:16:39,652
Mom and baby, okay?

443
00:16:39,737 --> 00:16:41,222
Teddy, you take over CPR.

444
00:16:41,353 --> 00:16:43,190
- I... Hold on. Hold on.
- I'm gonna prep for a crash C-section.

445
00:16:45,006 --> 00:16:46,949
Kendra:
Joey, take her arm.

446
00:16:47,034 --> 00:16:48,040
Get her out of here.

447
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:49,700
Come on.
Lesley, I love you.

448
00:16:49,785 --> 00:16:52,105
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry.

449
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:54,917
You don't have to
have me guarded.

450
00:16:55,001 --> 00:16:56,175
I'm not a lunatic.

451
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:58,916
You almost cut into a patient
with zero qualifications.

452
00:16:59,001 --> 00:17:00,579
I spent half my life
in hospitals.

453

No response from Dr. DeLuca.

He left over an hour ago.

524
00:19:46,212 --> 00:19:47,878
Should I not have
trusted him to go?

525
00:19:47,963 --> 00:19:49,539
Suture scissors.

526
00:19:51,702 --> 00:19:54,068
Okay.
So, why Switzerland?

527
00:19:54,153 --> 00:19:55,569
What?
We have time to kill.

528
00:19:55,654 --> 00:19:56,999
Why did you move
to Switzerland?

529
00:19:57,084 --> 00:19:59,471
I sort of ran away.
When my wife died.

530
00:19:59,609 --> 00:20:02,235
Took my kids and went to the
furthest place I could think of.

531

Don't usually get a
laugh when I tell that one.

532
00:20:06,056 --> 00:20:09,808
Uh, I'm sorry, it's just that
I did the same exact thing.

533
00:20:13,874 --> 00:20:15,533
Where'd you run to?

534
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:17,143
San Diego.

535
00:20:17,237 --> 00:20:18,783
No idea why.

536
00:20:18,868 --> 00:20:20,824
Hmm.

537
00:20:20,909 --> 00:20:23,760
When your husband died,
was it fast or was it slow?

538
00:20:23,915 --> 00:20:25,728
Fast, very fast.

539
00:20:27,515 --> 00:20:29,338
You?
Unbearably slow.

540
00:20:29,423 --> 00:20:30,752
Years.

541
00:20:31,533 --> 00:20:33,486
Everyone says
it gets easier.

542
00:20:37,063 --> 00:20:39,494
Well, it does
and it doesn't.

543
00:20:39,882 --> 00:20:42,877
I mean,
the firsts are tough.

544
00:20:43,393 --> 00:20:45,370
And just when you feel like
you're starting to heal...

545
00:20:45,454 --> 00:20:46,753
First time Liam got
a stomach bug,

546
00:20:46,837 --> 00:20:48,299
I nearly had
to be committed.

547
00:20:48,384 --> 00:20:50,518
15 years of medical training
out the window.

548

First anniversary,
first birthdays...

549

First kiss.

550

Okay, I'm back.
I got it.

Here. Here.
I got it.

553
00:21:06,626 --> 00:21:09,064
Dr. DeLuca,
tell me you wore gloves.

554
00:21:09,149 --> 00:21:10,855
Okay. I wore gloves.

555
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:12,978
Let's page
Dr. Avery right now.

556
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:14,849
And let's prep
for this transplant!

557
00:21:19,807 --> 00:21:22,353
Everyone is overexaggerating,
okay?

558
00:21:22,438 --> 00:21:25,472
We're taking away resources from
actual patients that need us.

559
00:21:25,557 --> 00:21:28,486
- Stop.

up needing it. - On it.

No. Stop.
This is ridiculous.

566
00:21:42,007 --> 00:21:42,972
I need to treat patients.

567
00:21:43,057 --> 00:21:44,893
You're not treating patients
like this.

568
00:21:44,978 --> 00:21:47,408
W-Who are you gonna treat?
You're not a doctor right now.

569
00:21:47,493 --> 00:21:48,894
Can... Can we get my sister
out of here, please?

570
00:21:48,978 --> 00:21:50,198
DeLuca, I've been
doing this all day,

571
00:21:50,282 --> 00:21:51,268
so I need you to listen close.

572
00:21:51,353 --> 00:21:53,853
If you do not let me treat you
exactly the way I need to,

573
00:21:53,938 --> 00:21:55,502
you will lose one or both
of your hands,

574
00:21:55,589 --> 00:21:56,878
and your future as
a surgeon, okay?

575
00:21:56,962 --> 00:21:59,019
So sit tight, shut the hell up,
and let me get you thawed out.

576
00:22:04,767 --> 00:22:06,580
A rib has punctured
the pericardium.

577
00:22:06,921 --> 00:22:08,507
Teddy: It feels like
one big clot.

578
00:22:08,592 --> 00:22:11,072
She's tamponading...
The heart has no room to beat.

579
00:22:11,157 --> 00:22:12,472
- We're gonna have
to open her up. - Metz.

580
00:22:12,556 --> 00:22:14,812
- How are you doing?
- Okay. Where's that warmer?

581
00:22:14,897 --> 00:22:17,924
Okay. Alright.

582
00:22:18,009 --> 00:22:20,478
Okay, here we go.

583
00:22:20,611 --> 00:22:22,346
Okay.

584
00:22:23,307 --> 00:22:24,883
Okay.

585
00:22:27,267 --> 00:22:28,763
Okay.

586
00:22:29,853 --> 00:22:32,149
Okay, starting compressions.

587
00:22:32,234 --> 00:22:35,408
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on.

588
00:22:35,532 --> 00:22:37,791
I'm gonna need a neonatal
intubation tray.

589
00:22:37,876 --> 00:22:39,952
Come on, come on, come on.
Come on, come on.

590
00:22:40,037 --> 00:22:42,623
I asked her not to
leave the house.

591
00:22:43,177 --> 00:22:44,994
I asked her not to go.

592
00:22:45,079 --> 00:22:47,205
Hey...

593
00:22:47,321 --> 00:22:50,228
You know, pregnant women
have a stubborn streak.

594
00:22:51,297 --> 00:22:53,275
Yeah, but this
isn't normal, right?

595
00:22:54,465 --> 00:22:57,511
I mean, having heart surgery
and delivering a baby?

596
00:22:57,822 --> 00:22:59,568
Have you ever seen this?

597
00:23:01,938 --> 00:23:04,394
Y...
I-I'll go check on her.

598
00:23:04,504 --> 00:23:06,135
Hey, stay right here.

599
00:23:12,486 --> 00:23:14,142
Her bleeding has stopped
with the shunt,

600
00:23:14,227 --> 00:23:15,932
and we did a successful
transplant.

601
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:17,265
Her numbers are improving.

602
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:19,356
So... she's okay.
Elisa's okay?

603
00:23:19,441 --> 00:23:20,549
She's gonna be okay.

604
00:23:22,795 --> 00:23:24,479
We'd like to thank the doctor
who went out in the snow

605
00:23:24,563 --> 00:23:25,870
to get the liver.
Do you know where he is?

606
00:23:25,954 --> 00:23:27,236
Oh, he's warming up.

607
00:23:27,321 --> 00:23:29,317
You've all been so...

608
00:23:29,833 --> 00:23:31,302
Thank you. Thank you.

609
00:23:31,387 --> 00:23:32,343
Mm-hmm.

610
00:23:32,427 --> 00:23:33,893
Thank you.

611
00:23:41,117 --> 00:23:43,455
Oh, God.
Is there an update?

612
00:23:43,778 --> 00:23:46,658
I just pulled a huge clot
out of her pericardium,

613
00:23:46,743 --> 00:23:48,410
- and now I'm massaging...
- Teddy: Wait, hold compressions.

614
00:23:48,494 --> 00:23:49,910
Let's see if we have a rhythm.

615
00:23:54,283 --> 00:23:56,228
Maggie: Alright, let's pack her

616
00:23:56,312 --> 00:23:57,385
and get her to the OR.

617
00:23:57,470 --> 00:24:00,306
- Uh, Hunt?
- Baby's intubated, two rounds of epi.

618
00:24:00,391 --> 00:24:02,697
Just hold on,
just... give it a second.

619
00:24:11,961 --> 00:24:13,337
It's a girl.

620

Bailey: Dear God.

621
00:24:16,726 --> 00:24:18,272

622
00:24:18,472 --> 00:24:20,058

Joey!

624
00:24:21,392 --> 00:24:23,268
He brought them both back.

625
00:24:23,649 --> 00:24:24,727
Awesome.

626
00:24:24,812 --> 00:24:27,938
He's right, Hunt.
Everybody, this was awesome.

627
00:24:29,194 --> 00:24:30,780
- It was, wasn't it?
- Oh!

628
00:24:50,199 --> 00:24:51,368
Careful.

629
00:24:51,453 --> 00:24:53,449
Avery's trying to
save DeLuca's hands

630
00:24:53,534 --> 00:24:54,991
because he played outside
for too long.

631
00:24:55,075 --> 00:24:56,661
How did you know
I was out here?

632
00:24:56,753 --> 00:24:59,337
A little blinking
beacon in my brain

633
00:24:59,422 --> 00:25:01,235
tells me where you are
at all times.

634
00:25:01,341 --> 00:25:02,758
That was creepy.
Even for me.

635
00:25:02,843 --> 00:25:06,425
No, I... I came down
from the ER with cocoa,

636
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:08,438
and I saw you walk
out of trauma one.

637
00:25:08,523 --> 00:25:10,196
Looked like
an unbelievable save.

638
00:25:10,281 --> 00:25:11,491
Here. Here.

639
00:25:11,576 --> 00:25:12,532
Thanks.

640
00:25:12,617 --> 00:25:14,524
Everything okay?

641
00:25:14,609 --> 00:25:16,985
Yeah, I'm just, uh...

642
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:20,712
I'm just, uh... trying
to quiet my mind.

643
00:25:20,797 --> 00:25:22,649
You know, I've had this fear
for a couple months,

644
00:25:22,733 --> 00:25:24,069
and I'm just, uh...

645
00:25:25,976 --> 00:25:27,972
Just worried that it
might be coming true.

646
00:25:28,057 --> 00:25:29,103
What's that?

647
00:25:29,188 --> 00:25:30,814
Well, I'm just...

648
00:25:31,063 --> 00:25:33,903
I'm worried that Owen is
the father of Amelia's baby.

649
00:25:33,988 --> 00:25:36,824
- Which is crazy, probably, right?
- That...

650
00:25:36,974 --> 00:25:39,600
But it... it...
I just... I can't shake it.

651
00:25:39,801 --> 00:25:41,225
It's the first thing
that went through my mind

652
00:25:41,309 --> 00:25:43,044
when I heard that Amelia
was pregnant.

653
00:25:43,129 --> 00:25:44,795
W-Why... Why do you
think that is?

654
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,130
- Because I'm broken, maybe?
- Ah.

655
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:52,223
'Cause I can't trust that things
will work out 'cause...

656
00:25:53,427 --> 00:25:55,513
Because maybe
I'm afraid that...

657
00:25:55,941 --> 00:25:58,027
That he'll always
be in love with Amelia.

658
00:25:58,150 --> 00:26:00,476
That's a terrible feeling,

659
00:26:00,561 --> 00:26:01,740
thinking somebody
you're in love with

660
00:26:01,824 --> 00:26:03,200
is pining
for someone else.

661
00:26:03,426 --> 00:26:06,551
I mean... trust me, I know.

662
00:26:06,636 --> 00:26:08,922
But, hey...

663
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:10,426
Come on. I...

664
00:26:10,511 --> 00:26:12,200
I've seen Owen with you.

665
00:26:12,936 --> 00:26:14,669
That man's clearly
in love with you.

666
00:26:14,754 --> 00:26:17,770
It's seeping out of his
ruddy little pores.

667
00:26:17,855 --> 00:26:19,721
Trust me,
I'd be the first one

668
00:26:19,806 --> 00:26:21,270
to tell you otherwise.

669
00:26:26,109 --> 00:26:27,815
Mm.

670
00:26:28,205 --> 00:26:29,781
You're a good man, Tom.

671
00:26:29,912 --> 00:26:31,528
Oh, God.

672
00:26:31,613 --> 00:26:34,069
You're the only person here
who thinks that.

673
00:26:34,747 --> 00:26:38,176
I-I know people
dislike me.

674
00:26:38,261 --> 00:26:39,575
Strongly.

675
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:42,864
And I know I don't show it,
but, uh, I think I hate it.

676
00:26:43,217 --> 00:26:45,778
And... they're all
part of a club,

677
00:26:45,863 --> 00:26:48,609
and they won't
have me join.

678
00:26:48,694 --> 00:26:50,240
And I've been trying
for two years.

679
00:26:51,576 --> 00:26:52,952
Well,
I don't dislike you.

680
00:26:53,037 --> 00:26:54,145
Hmm.

681
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:55,896
I'd even say I like you.

682
00:26:57,448 --> 00:26:58,483
Hm.

683
00:26:58,614 --> 00:27:00,860
A lot.
Hmm.

684
00:27:00,945 --> 00:27:02,262
Hmm.

687
00:27:06,832 --> 00:27:08,645
No, there's no look!
You always have a look.

688
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:10,106
No. No look.

I do know that.

764
00:30:33,721 --> 00:30:35,984

765

I wouldn't have
gone out there,

766

would be dead.

767
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:41,366
So I guess you're thanking me
for not listening to you.

768

773
00:30:57,931 --> 00:31:00,137
Why can't you just be happy
for me and accept that?

774
00:31:00,221 --> 00:31:01,907
Why... Why... Why you do
you always got to accuse me

775
00:31:01,991 --> 00:31:04,398
- of... of not being well?
- Because there's a history...

776
00:31:04,483 --> 00:31:06,079

780
00:31:27,321 --> 00:31:30,242

a couple of fires to put out.

781
00:31:30,327 --> 00:31:31,827

785
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:41,194

786

come back and eat
Thanksgiving dinner

796
00:32:13,193 --> 00:32:14,742
and... and do your
laundry.

797
00:32:14,827 --> 00:32:17,850
And maybe talk about
what career you want.

798
00:32:18,595 --> 00:32:20,466
Look, I don't need money
from the county.

799
00:32:20,551 --> 00:32:22,257

this is about.

800
00:32:22,341 --> 00:32:25,347

extra food,

801

understand eventually.

805
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:42,396

806
00:32:42,511 --> 00:32:44,991

to not to be serious?

807
00:32:46,917 --> 00:32:48,694

808
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:51,726

I'd like that.

809
00:32:51,811 --> 00:32:53,717

819

a terrible time with it.

825

826
00:33:55,655 --> 00:33:58,054
I have this feeling
that I can't shake,

827
00:33:58,139 --> 00:34:00,459
but has something to do
with Owen.

828
00:34:01,551 --> 00:34:03,101
I know that you're
Amelia's sister,

829
00:34:03,186 --> 00:34:04,781
and that your allegiance
is to her,

830
00:34:04,866 --> 00:34:06,515
and I deeply respect that.

831
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,547
And I'm not asking you to tell me
everything that you know,

832
00:34:08,631 --> 00:34:10,202
but I am asking you...

833
00:34:10,686 --> 00:34:11,807
Am I crazy?

834
00:34:11,891 --> 00:34:15,615
Am I seeing things that...
That... that aren't there?

835
00:34:19,105 --> 00:34:20,605
You're not crazy.

836
00:34:35,353 --> 00:34:37,939
- Hey.
- Ah.

837
00:34:38,935 --> 00:34:40,921
Uh, the rigs got the all-clear,
so I just...

838
00:34:41,006 --> 00:34:45,014
We just dropped off the guy
with the amputated foot.

839
00:34:45,778 --> 00:34:48,350
Uh, JJ gave birth at the station
in the bathroom.

840
00:34:48,443 --> 00:34:49,710
Wow, that's, um...

841
00:34:49,802 --> 00:34:52,052
But she's good.
She's good, and the baby's good.

842
00:34:52,137 --> 00:34:53,875
So...
I'm sorry, Vic.

843
00:34:54,419 --> 00:34:56,637
I'm... Look, I'm sorry
we had our first fight.

844
00:34:56,721 --> 00:34:58,122
I'm sorry I...

845
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:00,240
God, I'm too tired
to remember.

846
00:35:00,325 --> 00:35:02,263
But I... I am sorry.

847
00:35:03,761 --> 00:35:05,347
I'm sorry, too.

848
00:35:05,685 --> 00:35:07,224
It was stupid.

849
00:35:07,436 --> 00:35:09,311
I'm pretty sure
I was stupid, but...

850
00:35:09,396 --> 00:35:10,286
- Not touching that.
- Yeah.

851
00:35:10,371 --> 00:35:12,657
I know better than that.

852
00:35:12,742 --> 00:35:14,529
- Meet you at your place?
- Yeah.

853
00:35:14,614 --> 00:35:15,608
We could have
our second fight.

854
00:35:15,693 --> 00:35:17,232
Oh, it's too soon.

855
00:35:23,907 --> 00:35:25,756
Find your patient?

856
00:35:25,841 --> 00:35:28,412
Yeah, and she got to do
more medicine than I did

857
00:35:28,497 --> 00:35:30,427
because she impersonated
a surgeon.

858
00:35:30,511 --> 00:35:32,185
She could have
killed somebody.

859
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,926
Nico, you're silencing me
with sex.

860
00:35:41,011 --> 00:35:44,708
And it's really amazing sex,
but it's becoming all we do.

861
00:35:45,511 --> 00:35:47,686
And I understand if
you're not ready

862
00:35:47,771 --> 00:35:49,888
to talk about your parents.

863
00:35:50,034 --> 00:35:53,271
But I want a relationship,.

864
00:35:53,458 --> 00:35:54,858
Not an impersonation

865
00:35:54,943 --> 00:35:56,944
And this...
it doesn't feel real.

866
00:35:57,029 --> 00:35:59,307
Okay, look.
Uh, Levi...

867
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:02,427
I'm not you.

868
00:36:02,511 --> 00:36:04,847
I don't like talking
about feelings,

869
00:36:04,931 --> 00:36:06,217
I don't like to "dive deep."

870
00:36:06,301 --> 00:36:09,677
I like to show up
and just... be together.

871
00:36:09,825 --> 00:36:12,557
And I accept all
your feelings talk

872
00:36:12,641 --> 00:36:13,944
and whatever,
all of you.

873
00:36:14,029 --> 00:36:15,557
I accept you.

874
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:17,583
I don't try to change you.

875
00:36:19,029 --> 00:36:21,552
But you can't stop
trying to change me.

876
00:36:24,221 --> 00:36:27,192
So, this is all I have to give.
This right here, Levi...

877
00:36:27,277 --> 00:36:28,617
This is who I am.

878
00:36:30,601 --> 00:36:33,036
And if I'm really
not enough for you, then...

879
00:36:33,911 --> 00:36:35,864
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

880
00:36:35,982 --> 00:36:37,263
Don't go.

881

882

No, he didn't.

932

933
00:39:05,935 --> 00:39:09,637
I think he woke up one day

934
00:39:09,721 --> 00:39:14,497
and felt the need to
escape his life and me.

935
00:39:18,341 --> 00:39:19,849
I called his mom.
