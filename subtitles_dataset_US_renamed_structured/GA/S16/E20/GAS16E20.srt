00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:09,113
<i>Since our hospital
is a teaching program,</i>

2
00:00:10,105 --> 00:00:12,800
<i>many of our patients allow
their surgeries to be filmed.</i>

00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:16,909
<i>♪ He is more real than myself ♪</i>

4
00:00:16,994 --> 00:00:18,924
It's great as a teaching tool.

5
00:00:21,197 --> 00:00:22,665
<i>But if you screw up,</i>

6
00:00:23,626 --> 00:00:25,795
<i>it ends up online for
the whole world to see.</i>

7
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:28,886
<i>Your mistakes will
be scrutinized,</i>

8
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:32,830
<i>analyzed, studied,
written about...</i>

9
00:00:32,915 --> 00:00:34,713
Richard's plane should
be landing soon. You should go.

10
00:00:34,797 --> 00:00:37,175
<i>...argued over...
We have patients. You sure?</i>

11
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,385
You came for a tour.
You ended up working overnight.

12
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:40,601
Hold up, fellas.

13
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:43,188
You deserve the break, man.
Go be there for your mom.

14
00:00:43,272 --> 00:00:44,547
And Miranda.

15
00:00:44,632 --> 00:00:46,785
I hear you.
Let me finish with this burn.

16
00:00:47,254 --> 00:00:49,488
<i>...watched and re-watched.</i>

17
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:54,417
<i>♪ Did he take me ♪</i>

18
00:00:54,582 --> 00:00:55,756
<i>We all make mistakes.</i>

19
00:00:55,957 --> 00:00:58,155
<i>We all have moments when
we weren't the best surgeon</i>

20
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,445
- Okay.
<i>- Or even the best person.</i>

21
00:00:59,529 --> 00:01:01,374
Carotid duplex. Echo.

22
00:01:01,459 --> 00:01:02,966
CT to rule out stroke,

23
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:05,006
tremors,
intracranial hemorrhage.

24
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:07,126
Urinalysis
to rule out UTI.

25
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:08,676
Did they run
a tox screen?

26
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:10,870
Uh, and you
ran a tox screen?

27
00:01:12,068 --> 00:01:13,074
Clean.

28
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:14,886
Okay.
Well, thank you.

29
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:17,176
Uh, we'll confirm
when we've received them.

30
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,339
Let's round up the troops.

31
00:01:22,378 --> 00:01:24,046
<i>We all have moments
we'd rather not relive.</i>

32
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:27,086
<i>♪ My father's guarding me ♪</i>

33
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:29,120
Hey, I just checked
on the kids upstairs.

34
00:01:29,205 --> 00:01:30,256
Is he here yet?

35
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,418
En route.

36
00:01:31,503 --> 00:01:34,027
And I volunteered to
take over Pierce's cases

37
00:01:34,112 --> 00:01:35,402
so that she can
focus on Richard.

38
00:01:35,487 --> 00:01:37,637
And I'm still catching up
after the conference,

39
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:40,175
so I'm supposed to be
in three places now at once.

40
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:42,886
You know, I'm gonna
rearrange the cake thing

41
00:01:42,971 --> 00:01:45,081
and see if my mom can
take care of the kids tonight.

42
00:01:45,166 --> 00:01:46,261
- You need some sleep.
- Cake thing?

43
00:01:46,345 --> 00:01:47,348
What cake thing?

44
00:01:47,433 --> 00:01:48,796
You asked for
the wedding planner

45
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,909
to bring over a bunch of cakes
for us to try?

46
00:01:50,994 --> 00:01:53,393
Oh, right. God, I-I'm sorry.
I... It's just...

47
00:01:53,478 --> 00:01:55,189
No, no, no. No.
I get it. We all are.

48
00:01:55,426 --> 00:01:56,853
Yeah. It's Richard.

49
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,478
See ya.

50
00:02:01,247 --> 00:02:03,435
You think your body's
reached maximum capacity,

51
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,309
and then you just
keep growing.

52
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:07,278
I'm a human tissue
expander.

53
00:02:07,372 --> 00:02:08,498
No. You're...

54
00:02:08,583 --> 00:02:10,173
If you say glowing,
we're done.

55
00:02:11,567 --> 00:02:12,966
Any updates on Richard?

56
00:02:13,629 --> 00:02:14,834
No.

57
00:02:14,942 --> 00:02:16,544
But I've cleared my day
to work him up.

58
00:02:16,653 --> 00:02:17,724
Ow!

59
00:02:17,809 --> 00:02:18,990
Oh. What happened?

60
00:02:19,075 --> 00:02:20,926
You okay? Is the baby okay?
Should I page OB?

61
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:23,090
No, I'm fine.
It was just a big kick.

62
00:02:23,215 --> 00:02:24,716
We still have
a couple weeks left.

63
00:02:24,801 --> 00:02:25,840
You can't have
a panic attack

64
00:02:25,924 --> 00:02:27,028
every time the baby kicks.

65
00:02:27,112 --> 00:02:28,723
Can't make any promises.

66
00:02:31,465 --> 00:02:33,310
Your mom made these
for you every day?

67
00:02:33,395 --> 00:02:34,584
Why did you move out?

68
00:02:34,669 --> 00:02:36,318
She also folded
my underwear,

69
00:02:36,403 --> 00:02:37,796
threw away articles
of clothing

70
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,662
that didn't flatter
my nice butt,

71
00:02:39,747 --> 00:02:41,522
and every time I tried
to talk about a problem,

72
00:02:41,606 --> 00:02:44,294
she just shoved
a plate of food at me.

73
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:46,256
Like I said,
I don't get it.

74
00:02:46,668 --> 00:02:47,958
Well, I can't go back.

75
00:02:49,231 --> 00:02:52,145
You replaced me with
Schmitt, didn't you?

76
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,216
He's gonna be your
new best friend,

77
00:02:54,301 --> 00:02:56,021
and I'm gonna be with
my kid all the time,

78
00:02:56,106 --> 00:02:57,692
covered in bodily fluids.

79
00:02:57,845 --> 00:03:00,310
Sorry. Just, um...

80
00:03:00,395 --> 00:03:01,934
Due date's
getting closer.

81
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:03,419
I'm starting to, uh,

82
00:03:03,504 --> 00:03:05,684
wrap my head around the fact
that my life's over.

83
00:03:05,981 --> 00:03:07,942
Well...
you had a good run.

84
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:13,731
Yeah. I did.

85
00:03:14,364 --> 00:03:17,059
We've got
a 65-year-old male

86
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:20,177
suffering from
memory lapses, tremors,

87
00:03:20,262 --> 00:03:23,756
depression and mood swings,
and erratic behavior.

88
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,224
Yes, I am talking about
Richard Webber,

89
00:03:26,309 --> 00:03:28,177
but today,
he is not the Richard Webber

90
00:03:28,262 --> 00:03:29,677
you know and love.

91
00:03:29,762 --> 00:03:31,520
He is our number-one patient.

92
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:34,629
Two days ago,
he suffered a public...

93
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:36,841
episode at
a medical conference.

94
00:03:36,926 --> 00:03:39,513
Patient's history includes
an appendectomy,

95
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:42,013
a hip replacement,
surgery for a brain tumor

96
00:03:42,098 --> 00:03:43,654
pressing on
his optic nerve.

97
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:46,193
He was also electrocuted
several years ago,

98
00:03:46,278 --> 00:03:49,740
which led to surgery for
a pancreatic pseudocyst.

99
00:03:49,825 --> 00:03:52,248
Jo did that surgery
for the pseudocyst.

100
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:54,014
- Oh, sorry. Uh, Dr. Jo.
- Let's review what we have so far.

101
00:03:54,098 --> 00:03:55,966
You're crashing with
an attending. We get it.

102
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:59,263
This is a list
of possible diagnoses.

103
00:03:59,348 --> 00:04:01,286
Some, we have
already ruled out.

104
00:04:01,372 --> 00:04:02,795
This, we still need to.

105
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,966
Meredith.

106
00:04:04,051 --> 00:04:05,126
Uh, we'll run
all the labs.

107
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:07,880
We'll do the blood cultures,
vitamin levels,

108
00:04:07,965 --> 00:04:09,584
check the thyroid function,

109
00:04:09,669 --> 00:04:11,053
and we'll check the urine
for heavy metals.

110
00:04:11,137 --> 00:04:12,989
Mm-hmm.
Prepare yourselves.

111
00:04:13,247 --> 00:04:14,421
He's not himself.

112
00:04:14,506 --> 00:04:15,708
We saw the video.

113
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:19,725
Unless you get called
in for something emergent,

114
00:04:19,809 --> 00:04:21,762
this is your job today.
Yes?

115
00:04:21,847 --> 00:04:23,466
Uh... hi, Dr. Bailey.

116
00:04:23,551 --> 00:04:24,818
Hi. Tom Koracick, neuro.

117
00:04:24,903 --> 00:04:25,975
I know we don't
want to think it,

118
00:04:26,059 --> 00:04:28,083
but have we ruled out,
uh, dementia?

119
00:04:30,473 --> 00:04:31,521
No, we have not.

120
00:04:31,606 --> 00:04:33,818
Get a PET scan,
throw in a beta-amyloid tracer,

121
00:04:33,903 --> 00:04:35,107
and look for Alzheimer's.

122
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:36,216
It's not Alzheimer's.

123
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:39,310
Everything is on the table.
Nothing is out of the question.

124
00:04:39,395 --> 00:04:40,731
Let's get to work.

125
00:04:46,464 --> 00:04:49,334
Here he is. Dr. Lincoln,
meet Vera and Herschel Katano.

126
00:04:49,419 --> 00:04:52,591
I just did her ER intake,
and we got imaging back.

127
00:04:52,676 --> 00:04:54,126
Lisfranc injury with,

128
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:56,224
uh, fractured first
and second metatarsals.

129
00:04:56,309 --> 00:04:58,193
Oh, nasty break.
What happened?

130
00:04:58,278 --> 00:05:00,896
Uh, we were
in our home office,

131
00:05:00,981 --> 00:05:02,669
and I was standing
on a chair

132
00:05:02,754 --> 00:05:05,796
reaching for this textbook,
"The Elements of Statistics."

133
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,886
- We're professors at U-Dub.
- Mm-hmm.

134
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:09,974
It has one
particularly useful section

135
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:11,404
on game theory
that I love.

136
00:05:11,489 --> 00:05:13,974
The contents of the text
are irrelevant, dear.

137
00:05:14,059 --> 00:05:15,084
Oh, right.

138
00:05:15,169 --> 00:05:16,896
Well,
it's a hefty tome.

139
00:05:16,981 --> 00:05:18,826
And as I was
pulling it out,

140
00:05:18,911 --> 00:05:20,723
it slipped and landed
on my wife's foot.

141
00:05:20,809 --> 00:05:21,904
It's really broken?

142
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:23,982
It's really broken,
but we'll fix it,

143
00:05:24,067 --> 00:05:25,386
and we'll put her toes
back in place.

144
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:29,270
A book lands exactly
wrong on her foot.

145
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:30,676
What are the chances?

146
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,490
Uh, certainly higher than
getting struck by lightning,

147
00:05:33,575 --> 00:05:34,796
but less than getting
in a car accident.

148
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,626
What are the chances
of you letting

149
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:38,935
these nice doctors
do their job, hmm?

150
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:40,412
Hunt, you give me
a hand in the OR?

151
00:05:40,497 --> 00:05:41,913
- Yep. I'll see you up there.
- I'm supposed

152
00:05:41,997 --> 00:05:43,779
to make
a presentation of a paper

153
00:05:43,864 --> 00:05:45,216
in a university
in two days.

154
00:05:45,411 --> 00:05:47,498
You still can.
From the chair.

155
00:05:49,019 --> 00:05:51,159
Can you stomp
on his foot, hmm?

156
00:05:52,504 --> 00:05:53,614
Look,

157
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:56,096
I can get myself
into a bed.

158
00:06:01,356 --> 00:06:02,756
Sorry. Hey.

159
00:06:02,841 --> 00:06:04,857
Where have you been? And what
the hell are you wearing?

160
00:06:04,941 --> 00:06:07,061
I was with Warren on the
physician response team vehicle.

161
00:06:07,145 --> 00:06:08,747
- Don't worry about it.
- You smell like a garbage fire.

162
00:06:08,831 --> 00:06:10,302
Okay. Richard,
how are you feeling?

163
00:06:10,387 --> 00:06:11,505
How am I feeling?

164
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:13,716
Well, I was just wheeled
into my own damn hospital

165
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,176
like I was someone who's
lost control of their faculties.

166
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:18,466
We're gonna run a few more tests, okay?

167
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:19,626
No, that is not okay.

168
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:22,256
And stop treating me
like I'm an infant.

169
00:06:22,527 --> 00:06:24,176
Catherine was with me
at the conference.

170
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:26,386
Will you tell them that
they're being ridiculous?

171
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:27,481
Actually, Catherine...

172
00:06:27,566 --> 00:06:29,325
Yes, sweetheart,
I was there,

173
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:30,966
and your speech
was brilliant!

174
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:33,340
But you started feeling
badly right after.

175
00:06:33,425 --> 00:06:35,831
So, please, let us just
take a few more tests,

176
00:06:35,941 --> 00:06:37,284
and then we can go home.

177
00:06:37,369 --> 00:06:38,566
Promise.

178
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:41,926
Oh, alright.

179
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:43,499
But I'm only doing
this for Cleopatra.

180
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,913
Add visual
and auditory hallucinations

181
00:06:51,998 --> 00:06:53,115
to the list
of symptoms.

182
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,250
Okay.

183
00:06:58,663 --> 00:07:01,460
Hey.
Tom, I wanted to...

184
00:07:01,545 --> 00:07:03,086
Not get married
to someone else?

185
00:07:03,248 --> 00:07:04,350
I wanted to talk.

186
00:07:04,435 --> 00:07:06,795
No, I got it, but sincerely,
there's nothing to talk about.

187
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,476
I hope you
and Strawberry Shortcake

188
00:07:08,561 --> 00:07:10,256
live happily ever af...

189
00:07:10,662 --> 00:07:11,920
Tom, what is it?

190
00:07:16,472 --> 00:07:17,678
Tom.

191
00:07:17,763 --> 00:07:19,473
It's been a long time.

192
00:07:23,256 --> 00:07:25,186
Hi. I'm...
I'm Dr. Teddy Altman.

193
00:07:25,318 --> 00:07:27,504
Hi.
I'm, uh, Dana Hamilton,

194
00:07:27,589 --> 00:07:28,936
formerly Koracick.

195
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:32,117
And this is my son,
Guthrie.

196
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:35,538
Honey, say hi to
Dr. Altman and Dr. Tom.

197
00:07:35,623 --> 00:07:36,538
Nice to meet you.

198
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:38,164
My mom said you might be
kind of freaked out

199
00:07:38,248 --> 00:07:41,022
because I look like my brother
who died before I was born.

200
00:07:41,412 --> 00:07:42,882
And I would say sorry,

201
00:07:42,966 --> 00:07:45,491
but... I can't really
change my face, so...

202
00:07:46,332 --> 00:07:48,835
God,
you even sound a little bit like him.

203
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,716
Maybe you...
Can you change your voice?

204
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:53,116
I can try.

205
00:07:57,022 --> 00:08:00,491
I know the resemblance
to David is uncanny.

206
00:08:00,905 --> 00:08:02,265
I'm sorry.
I should have called.

207
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:04,093
But I didn't even know
that you would pick up

208
00:08:04,177 --> 00:08:06,272
if you saw that
it was me.

209
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:07,840
Um...

210
00:08:08,569 --> 00:08:10,483
- Guthrie has a brain tumor.
- Hm.

211
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,967
And apparently,
it's spread to his spine.

212
00:08:13,061 --> 00:08:15,420
And it's bad, Tom.

213
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:18,741
I wouldn't have come
if it weren't.

214
00:08:18,826 --> 00:08:20,616
I just wouldn't have come.

215
00:08:20,701 --> 00:08:22,256
Yeah.

216
00:08:22,506 --> 00:08:23,930
You know what,
let's get you checked in,

217
00:08:24,014 --> 00:08:25,007
and then we'll take it
from there.

218
00:08:25,092 --> 00:08:25,890
Tom,
do you want me to...?

219
00:08:25,975 --> 00:08:27,202
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

220
00:08:27,287 --> 00:08:29,678
Mrs. Hamilton, will you
follow me, please?

221
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,842
Nice to meet you, Dr. Tom.

225
00:08:47,592 --> 00:08:49,303
Guthrie Hamilton,
10 years old,

226
00:08:49,388 --> 00:08:52,350
diagnosed with primary
medulloblastoma in his brain

227
00:08:52,467 --> 00:08:54,586
that has spread to
his spine at C3.

228
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:56,398
Presents with
sensory deficits

229
00:08:56,483 --> 00:08:58,624
and motor weakness
in his extremities.

230
00:08:58,709 --> 00:09:02,256
He was in his cooking class,
and he just collapsed.

231
00:09:02,412 --> 00:09:04,006
It was awful.

232
00:09:04,316 --> 00:09:05,986
Pastry class, actually.

233
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,256
We were baking
croissants.

234
00:09:08,694 --> 00:09:09,836
I never got to try mine,

235
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,601
but the teacher said
they were pretty good.

236
00:09:11,694 --> 00:09:13,656
If you were stranded
on a desert island

237
00:09:13,741 --> 00:09:15,680
and you could only have
one food, what would it be?

238
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:17,256
He asks everyone this.

239
00:09:17,647 --> 00:09:18,638
Hummus.

240
00:09:18,723 --> 00:09:19,747
No.

241
00:09:19,832 --> 00:09:21,212
Brie.

242
00:09:22,158 --> 00:09:23,488
What about you,
Dr. Tom?

243
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:26,836
Um...

244
00:09:27,014 --> 00:09:28,256
escargot.

245
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:29,546
A man of excellent taste.

246
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:31,046
Um...

247
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:34,216
We should, uh... We should
get him some new scans.

248
00:09:34,358 --> 00:09:36,576
Let's... Let's... Let's get him
up there right away.

249
00:09:37,504 --> 00:09:38,623
Excuse me.

250
00:09:41,632 --> 00:09:42,888
I already
paged Shepherd.

251
00:09:42,973 --> 00:09:44,882
I don't know what
your ex-wife was thinking.

252
00:09:44,967 --> 00:09:46,210
She was thinking
I'm the best.

253
00:09:46,295 --> 00:09:48,374
She was thinking
I could never let this child die

254
00:09:48,459 --> 00:09:50,366
if there's a single thing
I could do to stop it.

255
00:09:51,794 --> 00:09:53,632
It's David, Teddy.

256
00:09:53,717 --> 00:09:55,881
It's him. And it's not.
And I'm...

257
00:09:57,983 --> 00:10:00,858
Tom, I'm here.
I'm staying close.

258
00:10:05,581 --> 00:10:08,030
- Can you walk?
- Yeah.

259
00:10:08,115 --> 00:10:09,506
Okay.

260
00:10:10,069 --> 00:10:11,116
Yeah.

261
00:10:19,423 --> 00:10:22,296
I'm late? Felt like
I was walking fast.

262
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:27,502
Abdominal midline incision
extending from the xiphoid

263
00:10:27,587 --> 00:10:28,939
to just under the umbilicus.

264
00:10:29,024 --> 00:10:30,046
What's that about?

265
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,796
Uh, he's going through
the steps of a Whipple

266
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,384
to prove to us that
he has not lost his mind.

267
00:10:35,383 --> 00:10:37,625
"Famous Surgeon Implodes
at Medical Conference."

268
00:10:37,876 --> 00:10:39,746
"Medical Meltdown
of the Year."

269
00:10:39,831 --> 00:10:41,161
It doesn't stop.

270
00:10:42,129 --> 00:10:44,502
Catherine's on the phone with
the foundation publicist

271
00:10:44,587 --> 00:10:46,151
to try to scrub it off
of the Internet,

272
00:10:46,236 --> 00:10:47,483
which isn't really
possible.

273
00:10:47,568 --> 00:10:49,680
Inspect the peritoneum
and the surface

274
00:10:49,773 --> 00:10:51,202
of the liver
for metastasis.

275
00:10:51,326 --> 00:10:52,866
"When you think
you cured cancer

276
00:10:52,951 --> 00:10:54,624

just got dumped."

277
00:10:56,085 --> 00:10:57,874
I hate everyone.

278
00:10:58,116 --> 00:11:00,032
I... Myself included.

279
00:11:00,116 --> 00:11:01,862
I was so busy
sexing it up with Winston

280
00:11:01,946 --> 00:11:04,032
I didn't even realize
what was happening.

281
00:11:04,116 --> 00:11:05,311
And I should have.

282
00:11:05,396 --> 00:11:07,014
He called me Meredith
when he saw me.

283
00:11:08,402 --> 00:11:09,868
Wait, what's a Winston?

284
00:11:10,116 --> 00:11:11,171
I'll tell you later.

285
00:11:11,256 --> 00:11:13,632
<i>Hepatic flexure
of the right colon</i>

286
00:11:13,842 --> 00:11:17,905
<i>mobilized and reflected
medially.</i>

287
00:11:18,156 --> 00:11:19,405
<i>There.</i>

288
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:23,014
<i>Now, would I be able to tell
you all that if I lost my mind?</i>

289
00:11:23,156 --> 00:11:24,902
The answer is
no, I wouldn't.

290
00:11:24,986 --> 00:11:26,507
Is he right?
About the steps?

291
00:11:26,592 --> 00:11:27,842
He is right.

292
00:11:27,927 --> 00:11:29,847
You're doing great, Richard.
You're almost there.

293
00:11:34,853 --> 00:11:36,421
Okay.

294
00:11:36,745 --> 00:11:40,421
No indication of Lewy body
dementia or Pick's disease.

295
00:11:40,506 --> 00:11:42,672
No increased signal
to the temporoparietal lobes,

296
00:11:42,757 --> 00:11:44,233
so maybe not Alzheimer's.

297
00:11:44,318 --> 00:11:46,399
But if it was in the early stages,
we wouldn't see it.

298
00:11:46,483 --> 00:11:47,702
It isn't Alzheimer's.

299
00:11:47,787 --> 00:11:50,101
I've had a front-row seat
to this disease.

300
00:11:50,186 --> 00:11:51,733
This is not it.

301
00:11:59,215 --> 00:12:00,915
Are we done yet?

302
00:12:02,296 --> 00:12:03,652
Drilling the K-wire.

303
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,569
Any word on Webber?

304
00:12:05,653 --> 00:12:07,671
Last I heard,
just more tests.

305
00:12:08,976 --> 00:12:12,182
Amelia was up all night
watching that conference video

306
00:12:12,267 --> 00:12:14,683
over and over again,
looking for clues.

307
00:12:14,768 --> 00:12:15,671
Worried me.

308
00:12:15,756 --> 00:12:17,288
Yeah. They've always
been close.

309
00:12:17,378 --> 00:12:19,234
I know, but stress
and exhaustion

310
00:12:19,319 --> 00:12:21,112
can cause hormone levels
to fluctuate,

311
00:12:21,196 --> 00:12:23,624
which can induce
preterm labor,

312
00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:25,632
and, you know, suddenly,
we've got a little dude

313
00:12:25,717 --> 00:12:27,008
who showed up to the party too early.

314
00:12:27,092 --> 00:12:29,397
Well, Amelia's close
to term, you know?

315
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:30,772
Baby's gonna be just fine.

316
00:12:32,413 --> 00:12:33,652
You're nervous?

317
00:12:33,736 --> 00:12:35,402
Name a worry,
I've had it.

318
00:12:35,486 --> 00:12:36,936
Will Amelia have
an easy delivery?

319
00:12:37,021 --> 00:12:39,358
Will we make it to
the hospital on time?

320
00:12:39,443 --> 00:12:40,710
Will the baby
be scared of me?

321
00:12:40,795 --> 00:12:41,871
Scared of you?

322
00:12:41,956 --> 00:12:43,390
Yeah, I mean,
I've got big hands.

323
00:12:43,475 --> 00:12:45,554
I don't know.
What if that freaks the baby out?

324
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:48,402
I know what you're gonna say...
That I'm just spinning out

325
00:12:48,486 --> 00:12:50,172
and soon as the baby
gets here, I'll be fine.

326
00:12:50,256 --> 00:12:51,922
Nope. I wasn't
gonna say that.

327
00:12:52,007 --> 00:12:53,109
- You weren't?
- No, because I like you.

328
00:12:53,193 --> 00:12:56,031
So while everyone else
is saying "Cherish this time,"

329
00:12:56,116 --> 00:12:57,530
I'm gonna tell you
the truth, okay?

330
00:12:57,615 --> 00:12:59,161
Parenthood
is scary as hell.

331
00:12:59,246 --> 00:13:01,493
Your kid is in the safest place
he's ever gonna be right now.

332
00:13:01,577 --> 00:13:03,686
When he comes out,
you're never gonna sleep again.

333
00:13:03,997 --> 00:13:05,044
Wire cutters.

334
00:13:05,129 --> 00:13:06,162
Thanks.

335
00:13:11,276 --> 00:13:12,319
Hey.
Hey, what's up?

336
00:13:12,404 --> 00:13:13,890
Oh, we're swamped.
I need you to jump in.

337
00:13:13,974 --> 00:13:15,842
I need you to evaluate
beds 2 through 7

338
00:13:15,927 --> 00:13:17,401
for smoke inhalation
and clear them.

339
00:13:17,486 --> 00:13:18,711
But I've been helping
with Dr. Webber.

340
00:13:18,795 --> 00:13:20,798
Hey, Schmitt, no offense,
but whatever's wrong with Webber

341
00:13:20,882 --> 00:13:21,867
won't be solved
by a resident.

342
00:13:21,952 --> 00:13:23,952
Oh. Uh, okay.

343
00:13:24,671 --> 00:13:25,890
Why are you still
standing here?!

344
00:13:25,974 --> 00:13:27,350
Alright. I'm going.
I'm going.

345
00:13:27,616 --> 00:13:28,362
Sorry.

346
00:13:28,446 --> 00:13:30,139
Take him over
to bed 10.

347
00:13:30,269 --> 00:13:32,486
So, I-I-I'm sitting on this
park bench the other day, right,

348
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:34,646
and I look across,
and I see this squirrel,

349
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:38,195
and he's... he's hauling this
giant slice of pizza, right?

350
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:39,856
Then he starts
dragging it up the street.

351
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:41,665
I mean, the thing must have
been twice his size.

352
00:13:41,749 --> 00:13:43,343
I don't even know how he was doing it.

353
00:13:44,728 --> 00:13:47,184
Oh. You finally here
to let me go?

354
00:13:47,328 --> 00:13:49,436
Um... waiting
on blood cultures.

355
00:13:49,521 --> 00:13:52,097
T-The ER's slammed,
so the lab's backed up.

356
00:13:52,182 --> 00:13:53,531
Dr. DeLuca?

357
00:13:59,228 --> 00:14:01,434
Have I been
in any way unclear

358
00:14:01,566 --> 00:14:02,843
about your suspension?

359
00:14:02,927 --> 00:14:04,843
Come on, Bailey.
I can't visit a friend?

360
00:14:04,952 --> 00:14:07,203
Webber's a mentor of mine.
We hang out socially.

361
00:14:07,288 --> 00:14:08,561
I saw the news.
I got worried.

362
00:14:08,646 --> 00:14:11,022
Fine. But after visiting hours,
you're gone.

363
00:14:11,115 --> 00:14:12,281
Understood.

364
00:14:12,537 --> 00:14:14,336
Hey, y-you need to add
decreased appetite

365
00:14:14,421 --> 00:14:15,362
to his list of symptoms.

366
00:14:15,446 --> 00:14:17,319
- DeLuca!
- Look, Dr. Riley says

367
00:14:17,404 --> 00:14:19,750
that we learn more from
our patients in conversation

368
00:14:19,835 --> 00:14:20,843
than traditional questioning,
right?

369
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,919
So, she's out of the country
right now, but she e-mailed me

370
00:14:23,003 --> 00:14:24,725
this list of topics
to get him talking,

371
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:26,282
a-a-and I think
that it could open more avenues

372
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:27,656
for... for research,
and... and he could...

373
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:29,249
Visiting hours
are almost over.

374
00:14:30,154 --> 00:14:31,520
And forward me that list.

375
00:14:34,149 --> 00:14:35,355
Okay.

376
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:39,319
Hey. You paged me?

377
00:14:39,404 --> 00:14:41,351
I'm still pretty busy with
the Richard thing, so...

378
00:14:41,435 --> 00:14:44,054
We have a 10-year-old
with a medulloblastoma

379
00:14:44,139 --> 00:14:45,902
and a drop met
on his cervical spine.

380
00:14:45,986 --> 00:14:48,282
And... Koracick needs me
because...?

381
00:14:48,366 --> 00:14:49,507
It's his ex-wife's son.

382
00:14:49,592 --> 00:14:51,842
Apparently, the kid looks
exactly like David.

383
00:14:51,927 --> 00:14:53,038
David was...

384
00:14:53,123 --> 00:14:54,829
No, I know.
I-I knew David.

385
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,319
Oh, my God.

386
00:14:56,404 --> 00:14:58,692
What are the chances Dana's
gonna lose another 10-year-old?

387
00:14:58,776 --> 00:14:59,858
Hopefully not.

388
00:14:59,943 --> 00:15:01,733
Hopefully
you can save him.

389
00:15:02,978 --> 00:15:04,938
'Cause Tom certainly can't.

390
00:15:06,204 --> 00:15:08,151
The tumor is getting bigger.

391
00:15:08,236 --> 00:15:09,811
It's encroaching
on the brain stem.

392
00:15:11,906 --> 00:15:13,116
Do they know?

393
00:15:14,331 --> 00:15:15,546
I'll talk to them.

394
00:15:15,695 --> 00:15:16,811
I will take it from here.

395
00:15:16,896 --> 00:15:17,936
Okay.

396
00:15:23,608 --> 00:15:26,314
Dr. Lincoln was able to reduce
the toes back into their place.

397
00:15:26,437 --> 00:15:28,263
The surgery went
extremely well.

398
00:15:28,456 --> 00:15:29,780
We'll leave
the splint on,

399
00:15:29,865 --> 00:15:31,828
but no weight-bearing
on this foot for 12 weeks.

400
00:15:31,913 --> 00:15:32,858
You understand?

401
00:15:32,943 --> 00:15:36,467
Oh, thank you
so much, doctors.

402
00:15:36,552 --> 00:15:38,048
- Thank... Thank you.
- Sure.

403
00:15:38,219 --> 00:15:39,385
Hear that, Vera?

404
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:41,335
I'm waiting on you
for 12 weeks.

405
00:15:41,446 --> 00:15:42,749
84 days.

406
00:15:42,834 --> 00:15:45,343
Hand and... foot, honey.

407
00:15:45,428 --> 00:15:46,322
Cup of tea,

00:15:48,526 --> 00:15:49,913
Ha! Whatever you need.

410
00:15:50,005 --> 00:15:51,811
We'll check on you in
a couple hours, okay?

It's happening again.

I'm gonna lose him,
too.

426
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:59,595
You are in great hands
with Dr. Shepherd.

427
00:16:59,719 --> 00:17:02,481
No offense,
but we came here f-for Tom.

428
00:17:05,269 --> 00:17:08,395
Dana, I use all the same
techniques as Tom.

429
00:17:08,689 --> 00:17:09,819
I trained under him.

430
00:17:09,904 --> 00:17:11,928
He taught me
everything he knows.

431
00:17:16,033 --> 00:17:18,619
I did not bring him
here to hurt you.

432
00:17:18,843 --> 00:17:20,549
I-I ran out of ideas.

433
00:17:20,696 --> 00:17:23,132
I didn't know
what else to do.

434
00:17:23,482 --> 00:17:24,866
I can't...

435
00:17:25,165 --> 00:17:27,194
I can't, Tom.

436
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:29,656
Tom, I can't
go through this again.

437
00:17:29,741 --> 00:17:31,112
I won't survive.

438
00:17:31,202 --> 00:17:32,696
I won't survive.

439
00:17:34,703 --> 00:17:36,039
I can't.

These doctors
broke my wife.

463
00:18:23,904 --> 00:18:26,724
Vera had surgery on her
Lisfranc injury this morning.

She woke up alert
but... singing.

465
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:31,097

466
00:18:31,181 --> 00:18:32,958
Everything appears...
normal.

467
00:18:33,526 --> 00:18:35,572
Uh, let's order
a brain MRI and an EEG.

468
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:37,857
Vera, we're gonna rule out
an intra-operative stroke,

469
00:18:37,942 --> 00:18:40,302
but this could be something
called "musicophilia."

470

No. It's

about this while we're in gridlock?

00:19:17,821 --> 00:19:19,450
Well, I just assessed
beds 3 and 4.

Congratulations.
We're still gridlocked.

488
00:19:21,496 --> 00:19:22,448
Is that my fault?

489
00:19:22,533 --> 00:19:24,449
It's not not your fault!

are in a room right now
working on Webber.

492
00:19:28,244 --> 00:19:31,160
This is your moment
to step up, to rise, to shine,

493
00:19:31,245 --> 00:19:33,693
to take care of incoming before
you get run over by a gurney!

494
00:19:34,459 --> 00:19:36,086

Hey. So, Shepherd is

497
00:19:47,444 --> 00:19:48,860
Thank you.

498
00:19:57,446 --> 00:20:01,192
God, ever since David died,
I've had this thought...

499
00:20:01,724 --> 00:20:05,958
What if I got to the hospital
in time to operate?

500
00:20:06,043 --> 00:20:09,161
Maybe... I could
have saved him.

501
00:20:09,986 --> 00:20:11,732
And now it's like...

502
00:20:13,763 --> 00:20:16,716
he's here, and I can't...
I can't be in the same room

503
00:20:16,801 --> 00:20:19,552
without feeling like
I'm... drowning.

504
00:20:21,216 --> 00:20:23,818
That thought I've been
holding on to... it's a lie.

505
00:20:28,283 --> 00:20:29,993
I got to update
my patient.

506
00:20:34,231 --> 00:20:37,307
Okay, so,
the first one is,

507
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:40,591
we are going to repeat
this pattern.

508
00:20:42,486 --> 00:20:44,083
Mm...

509
00:20:46,313 --> 00:20:49,099
Um... you know what?
Let's come back to that one.

510
00:20:49,184 --> 00:20:50,230
Okay, sure.

511
00:20:50,413 --> 00:20:53,373
So, let's draw
this 3-D cube.

512
00:21:01,978 --> 00:21:03,478
Mm-hmm.

513
00:21:05,802 --> 00:21:07,776
Okay...

514
00:21:09,946 --> 00:21:11,286
Okay.

515
00:21:11,566 --> 00:21:13,138
Right here.

516
00:21:13,223 --> 00:21:15,599
Well, why don't we just,
uh, skip to this one here

517
00:21:15,946 --> 00:21:17,755
and draw a clock?

518
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:21,005
And we want the time
to say 10 past 11:00.

519
00:21:21,236 --> 00:21:22,282
Okay.

520
00:21:22,401 --> 00:21:25,088
Alright, this is...
Okay. I got this.

521
00:21:25,173 --> 00:21:26,799
Yeah.
You got this, Richard.

522
00:21:26,884 --> 00:21:28,514
Yeah.

Mm-hmm.

526
00:21:46,338 --> 00:21:48,283
Okay, you know, we can take
a break for right now.

527
00:21:48,367 --> 00:21:49,321
We can
come back to this.

528
00:21:49,406 --> 00:21:50,942
Okay, well, hang on.
I wasn't finished with it.

529
00:21:51,026 --> 00:21:51,891
It's okay.

530
00:21:51,976 --> 00:21:54,656

We're about to publish.

535
00:22:14,696 --> 00:22:17,125
And you don't want people
questioning your state of mind.

536
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:18,484
There's no signs of stroke

537
00:22:18,568 --> 00:22:20,322
or bleeding, and the EEG's negative
for seizures.

538
00:22:20,406 --> 00:22:21,227
Okay.

539
00:22:21,312 --> 00:22:23,695
So, she's just
like this now?

540
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:25,241
Which is good news,
Herschel.

541
00:22:25,326 --> 00:22:26,782
It's most likely
a complication

542
00:22:26,866 --> 00:22:27,969
from being
under anesthesia.

543
00:22:28,054 --> 00:22:29,560
We're gonna keep her
here overnight

544
00:22:29,645 --> 00:22:30,680
for monitoring purposes,

545
00:22:30,765 --> 00:22:32,235
but you should be able
to take her home tomorrow.

00:22:33,476 --> 00:22:34,732
Yeah. Great.

00:22:36,991 --> 00:22:39,691
Hey, any update on Richard?

549
00:22:39,776 --> 00:22:41,314
Uh, n-no idea.

550
00:22:47,673 --> 00:22:49,345
I'm not here
with an update.

551
00:22:49,946 --> 00:22:51,111
It's just me.

552
00:22:51,196 --> 00:22:53,692
I don't need you, Jackson.
Richard needs you.

553
00:22:53,869 --> 00:22:55,285
Okay, Mom...

554
00:22:55,431 --> 00:22:57,759
You're letting him down.
Do you know that?

555
00:22:57,844 --> 00:23:00,361
He's given this hospital
the best years of his life,

556
00:23:00,446 --> 00:23:02,282
and you all are
the best minds in the field,

557
00:23:02,366 --> 00:23:05,282
and no one even noticed
that he wasn't himself,

558
00:23:05,366 --> 00:23:06,853
that he was deteriorating?

559
00:23:06,938 --> 00:23:09,774
In fairness to us, I think
we thought that he was depressed

560
00:23:09,859 --> 00:23:11,650
because his wife
both left him

561
00:23:11,735 --> 00:23:13,962
and bought the hospital
that he was working at.

562
00:23:14,047 --> 00:23:16,413
You don't think I've been
dying inside already?

563
00:23:16,498 --> 00:23:18,197
I'm sure you have,
and I'm sorry, Mom,

564
00:23:18,282 --> 00:23:19,282
but us fighting isn't...

565
00:23:19,366 --> 00:23:20,987
Do you think I haven't
been kicking myself

566
00:23:21,071 --> 00:23:24,986
for the last 48 hours, wondering
what I would have noticed

567
00:23:25,071 --> 00:23:28,157
if I could just
have put aside my pride?

568
00:23:29,066 --> 00:23:30,689
I should have
been there.

569
00:23:30,952 --> 00:23:33,111
I would have
seen something.

570
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:35,173
I'm his wife.

571
00:23:35,634 --> 00:23:37,103
I'm his wife.

572
00:23:39,236 --> 00:23:40,689
I'm his wife.

573
00:23:40,774 --> 00:23:43,940
So I can't be on his
medical team, but you can.

574
00:23:44,125 --> 00:23:48,376
So you get back in that war room
and figure it out.

575
00:23:49,986 --> 00:23:51,345
Now.

576
00:23:54,554 --> 00:23:56,267

How you holding up?

582
00:24:16,684 --> 00:24:17,942
Mm.

583
00:24:18,026 --> 00:24:20,606
You know,
about five years ago,

584
00:24:20,691 --> 00:24:23,848
I spilled an iced tea
all over my car's dashboard.

585
00:24:24,497 --> 00:24:26,762
It fried something in
the electrical system

586
00:24:26,979 --> 00:24:29,395
and caused my seatbelt alarm
to constantly beep.

587
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,606
Even if the belt was buckled,
"Beep, beep, beep."

588
00:24:32,589 --> 00:24:35,262
I was trying to
meet a book deadline,

589
00:24:35,347 --> 00:24:37,196
so I couldn't
get it fixed,

590
00:24:37,281 --> 00:24:40,848
so for weeks...
"Beep, beep, beep."

591
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:42,856
And...

592
00:24:44,637 --> 00:24:45,740
...I learned
to live with it.

593
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:49,160
It faded in the background,
almost became comforting.

594
00:24:49,826 --> 00:24:51,504
Will this ever fade?

595
00:24:52,172 --> 00:24:53,848
Maybe. Yeah.

596
00:24:54,276 --> 00:24:57,215
Or you could...
grow to like it?

597
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:59,418
And I've read that it
can help these patients

598
00:24:59,503 --> 00:25:01,278
if you give them
an instrument to play.

599
00:25:01,363 --> 00:25:06,279
Vera and I work at home because
the library is too loud.

600
00:25:06,633 --> 00:25:09,139
If an oboe or something like
that comes into my life,

601
00:25:09,224 --> 00:25:10,724
I will have
very dark thoughts.

602
00:25:11,526 --> 00:25:13,606
Oh, um, please...

603
00:25:14,063 --> 00:25:16,479
Don't tell her
that I compared her voice

604
00:25:16,696 --> 00:25:19,293
to the broken seatbelt
in our 1997 station wagon.

605
00:25:19,378 --> 00:25:20,674
No.

606
00:25:22,472 --> 00:25:23,648
It stopped.

607
00:25:23,905 --> 00:25:24,991
Oh, my God, it stopped.

608
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:26,656

610
00:25:29,357 --> 00:25:30,742
- What's happening?!
- She's hypoxic and tachycardic.

611
00:25:30,826 --> 00:25:32,063
Uh, Herschel, we need you
to wait outside.

612
00:25:32,147 --> 00:25:33,180
B-B-But she was fine
a second ago!

613
00:25:33,264 --> 00:25:35,496
I-I-I'll update you
as soon as we know anything.

614
00:25:39,406 --> 00:25:41,977

We're not even at
the hard part yet.

617
00:25:44,381 --> 00:25:46,327

resect the tumor

618

- ...Okay, until it does, you have time.

634
00:26:28,967 --> 00:26:30,673

637
00:26:34,081 --> 00:26:35,402
Don't make me do this.

638
00:26:35,486 --> 00:26:37,442
Tom, you saw the scans.

639
00:26:37,526 --> 00:26:39,448
You and I are the best
two in this hospital,

640
00:26:39,533 --> 00:26:41,619
maybe this country,
to remove this tumor.

641
00:26:41,715 --> 00:26:44,371

I can't do it.

642
00:26:44,566 --> 00:26:46,651

of rapidly progressive
dementia,

647
00:26:58,406 --> 00:27:00,786
and so far, none of our tests
can point to a cause.

648
00:27:01,066 --> 00:27:03,098

very well be...

not say it.

652
00:27:10,406 --> 00:27:11,793
Okay, let's split up.

653
00:27:11,878 --> 00:27:13,482
- Uh, I'll look around here.
- I'll take the OR floor.

654
00:27:13,566 --> 00:27:14,442

00:28:56,656 --> 00:28:58,322
Come on, buddy.
You can do it.

700
00:29:00,206 --> 00:29:01,324
Here we go.

701
00:29:01,409 --> 00:29:02,905
There!

702
00:29:03,094 --> 00:29:04,100
Gotcha.

703
00:29:04,185 --> 00:29:05,801
End-Tidal CO2's
coming back.

704
00:29:06,026 --> 00:29:07,777
BP's rising. -

705
00:29:07,862 --> 00:29:09,374
He's stabilizing.

706
00:29:10,173 --> 00:29:11,371
That was amazing.

707
00:29:11,508 --> 00:29:12,635
We're not out
of the woods yet.

708
00:29:12,719 --> 00:29:14,136
Let's get him back
into position. Let's go.

711
00:29:18,946 --> 00:29:20,032
Tension pneumo,
maybe from intubation.

712
00:29:20,116 --> 00:29:21,696
I'm gonna need
a 14-gauge needle.

713
00:29:23,204 --> 00:29:24,675
Okay?

714
00:29:24,924 --> 00:29:26,861
Alright, Vera.
I know it's hard,

715
00:29:26,946 --> 00:29:28,761
but you need
to try to relax, okay?

716
00:29:29,333 --> 00:29:30,539
Thank you.

717
00:29:30,675 --> 00:29:32,072
Vera,
on the count of three,

718
00:29:32,156 --> 00:29:33,652
I'm gonna insert
this needle, okay?

719
00:29:33,736 --> 00:29:35,572
One, two, three.

720
00:29:37,866 --> 00:29:38,692
Better?

721
00:29:38,776 --> 00:29:40,933
Vera! Are you okay?!

722
00:29:41,018 --> 00:29:42,054
I thought...

723
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:44,847

I was losing you.

I'm just enjoying
the moment.

733
00:30:20,959 --> 00:30:21,995
- Oh, God.
- What?

734
00:30:22,516 --> 00:30:23,972
It's happening.

735
00:30:24,057 --> 00:30:25,746
Ame... Amelia.
It's... It's happening.

740
00:30:35,064 --> 00:30:36,230
Where's Carina?

741
00:30:36,315 --> 00:30:38,072
She's on vacation with
her stupid girlfriend!

742
00:30:38,156 --> 00:30:39,378
That's okay.

743
00:30:39,463 --> 00:30:40,456
T-That's okay, right?

744
00:30:40,541 --> 00:30:41,981
No, no!
Nothing is okay!

745
00:30:42,066 --> 00:30:43,482
This whole time,
I've been thinking

746
00:30:43,566 --> 00:30:45,567
that if I could just give birth
to a healthy baby boy,

747
00:30:45,651 --> 00:30:47,630
that... that... that I would
have won some kind of race,

748
00:30:47,714 --> 00:30:48,572
just crossed
the finish line,

749
00:30:48,656 --> 00:30:50,282
but that's not where
the finish line is.

750
00:30:50,366 --> 00:30:52,370
- I know. There is no finish line.
- No, there's no finish line!

751
00:30:52,454 --> 00:30:53,881
Once this baby is out
in the world,

752
00:30:54,055 --> 00:30:56,401
literally anything could
happen to him...

753
00:30:56,486 --> 00:30:59,291
Cancer, car crash,
baseballs!

754
00:30:59,376 --> 00:31:01,151
- Baseballs?
- Ahh, make me feel better!

755
00:31:01,236 --> 00:31:02,362
Here.

756
00:31:02,446 --> 00:31:03,942
N... ju... ju... ju...

757
00:31:04,026 --> 00:31:05,402
- I-I'm freaking out!
- What are we gonna do?!

758
00:31:05,486 --> 00:31:07,692
- I don't know!
- Stop yelling at me!

759
00:31:10,486 --> 00:31:12,228
Aaaaaaaah!

760
00:31:14,868 --> 00:31:16,236
Scalpel.

761
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:21,516
You're late, Grey.

762
00:31:21,601 --> 00:31:23,861
I was just about to proceed
with the initial incision.

763
00:31:23,946 --> 00:31:25,486
Richard.

764
00:31:29,476 --> 00:31:31,010
You in or out?

765
00:31:33,563 --> 00:31:35,643
What's it gonna be?

766
00:31:37,091 --> 00:31:38,207
Let's see...

767
00:31:46,892 --> 00:31:49,782
Uh, uh... what surgery
are we performing?

768
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:52,720
Um, the ex-lap.

769
00:31:52,813 --> 00:31:54,270
I'm glad to see you've
come to your senses.

770
00:31:54,354 --> 00:31:55,826
I could use the assist.

771
00:32:00,116 --> 00:32:01,742
Okay, Richard.

772
00:32:01,826 --> 00:32:03,652
Uh, we need to, um...

773
00:32:03,826 --> 00:32:05,362
Hmm?
...ch... check the, uh...

774
00:32:05,446 --> 00:32:08,349
The scalpel to make sure
it's been sterilized properly.

775
00:32:09,459 --> 00:32:11,709
Sterilized?
Of course it's sterilized.

776
00:32:13,593 --> 00:32:15,781
- Richard, please.
- No, no, no.

777
00:32:15,866 --> 00:32:17,282
I... It needs
to be me, okay?

778
00:32:17,366 --> 00:32:19,402
I'm the only one who
can fix what's wrong.

779
00:32:19,486 --> 00:32:20,442
No, that is not true.

780
00:32:20,526 --> 00:32:22,085
Yes, it is!

781
00:32:27,783 --> 00:32:29,493
Richard, I can fix you.

782
00:32:30,991 --> 00:32:32,483
And I know I can fix you

783
00:32:32,568 --> 00:32:35,639
because you are the one
who taught me everything I know.

784
00:32:35,776 --> 00:32:37,968
And I'm not just
talking about surgery.

785
00:32:38,748 --> 00:32:40,784
You taught me how
to be a better person,

786
00:32:40,869 --> 00:32:42,468
how to be
a better mother.

787
00:32:42,553 --> 00:32:44,147
And what about
my children?

788
00:32:44,232 --> 00:32:46,422
I want them to grow up
and know who you are.

789
00:32:46,507 --> 00:32:47,507
Please.

790
00:32:48,607 --> 00:32:51,335
And I still have things
I need to learn.

791
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:54,178
I need you. I'm not ready
to let you go yet.

792
00:32:56,232 --> 00:32:58,639
And I know
other people aren't, either.

793
00:33:03,061 --> 00:33:05,413
Hand me the scalpel,
please.

794
00:33:14,007 --> 00:33:15,007
Ellis.

795
00:33:17,546 --> 00:33:19,905
Something's...
wrong with me.

796
00:33:23,899 --> 00:33:25,288
Yes.

797
00:33:25,475 --> 00:33:26,721
It's okay.

798
00:33:26,986 --> 00:33:28,663
Take my hand, Richard.

799
00:33:31,681 --> 00:33:34,017
Let's go, now.
Come on.

800
00:33:46,838 --> 00:33:50,111
We removed the primary tumor
and the spinal metastasis,

801
00:33:50,196 --> 00:33:52,757
so he'll need some radiation of
the brain and the spinal cord,

802
00:33:52,842 --> 00:33:56,598
but as of now,
Guthrie is on the road to recovery.

803
00:33:59,209 --> 00:34:00,325
Okay?

804
00:34:00,448 --> 00:34:01,658
Okay.

805
00:34:03,358 --> 00:34:05,234
Okay. Yeah.

806
00:34:05,467 --> 00:34:07,225
Hey, Doc, uh,
I don't know

807
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:09,194
how we're ever gonna
be able to thank you.

808
00:34:09,596 --> 00:34:10,646
Mm.

809
00:34:13,276 --> 00:34:14,692
I thought
you couldn't do it.

810
00:34:14,776 --> 00:34:17,718
Still can't believe I...
I did.

811
00:34:18,326 --> 00:34:19,530
I'm sorry.

812
00:34:20,069 --> 00:34:21,822
No, no, no. No.

813
00:34:21,968 --> 00:34:23,157
And thank you.

814
00:34:23,259 --> 00:34:24,417

815
00:34:24,521 --> 00:34:25,521
Yeah.

816
00:34:26,776 --> 00:34:29,066
And Guthrie's, uh...

817
00:34:31,741 --> 00:34:33,027
It's a good name.

818
00:34:43,986 --> 00:34:45,492
Oh. Another one?
Is it bad?

819
00:34:45,577 --> 00:34:47,821
Ohh, you know when guys
get kicked in their... guys?

820
00:34:47,906 --> 00:34:49,193
How do you know
what that feels like?

821
00:34:49,277 --> 00:34:51,618
Everything goes black.
You want to throw up.

822
00:34:51,718 --> 00:34:53,923
Your whole body goes cold
all over because of the pain.

823
00:34:54,008 --> 00:34:54,941
That's exactly what
it feels like.

824
00:34:55,026 --> 00:34:56,946
Hoo! This is worse.

825
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,450
We're gonna have a baby!

826
00:34:59,566 --> 00:35:00,743
We're gonna have a baby!

827
00:35:00,828 --> 00:35:02,001
Good news,
Dr. Shepherd!

828
00:35:02,086 --> 00:35:04,244
Based on the pelvic exam
and cervical length

829
00:35:04,329 --> 00:35:06,478
on ultrasound,
it looks like Braxton Hicks.

830
00:35:06,563 --> 00:35:08,399
Braxton Hicks?
False labor.

831
00:35:08,484 --> 00:35:10,230
When the uterus contracts
and relaxes.

832
00:35:10,315 --> 00:35:11,771
I know what
Braxton Hicks are.

833
00:35:11,869 --> 00:35:13,915
S-So, no baby?

834
00:35:14,061 --> 00:35:15,268

00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:45,144
Oh, did they
extend your shift?

863
00:36:45,229 --> 00:36:47,673
Uh, to sleep.

864
00:36:48,459 --> 00:36:50,415
And I-I-I don't want

A fish?

866
00:36:52,826 --> 00:36:54,612
Levi, what are you
talking about?

867
00:36:54,696 --> 00:36:56,322
House guests and fish.

868
00:36:56,406 --> 00:36:58,282
After three days,
they both start to stink.

869
00:36:58,366 --> 00:36:59,923
My mom taught me that.

870
00:37:00,008 --> 00:37:02,054
Okay, your mom also
taught you

871
00:37:02,139 --> 00:37:03,681
to hide the best parts
of yourself.

872
00:37:03,766 --> 00:37:05,272
Why would you ever
listen to her?

873
00:37:05,405 --> 00:37:08,209
Well, you keep telling me
how great I had it at my mom's

874
00:37:08,294 --> 00:37:10,410
and spent the whole day

doing a good job.

we're friends.

878

I know that I wasn't
an attending when we met,

879
00:37:21,118 --> 00:37:22,825
but I am now, and that means
I'm gonna snap at you

wrong.

gonna become the surgeon
