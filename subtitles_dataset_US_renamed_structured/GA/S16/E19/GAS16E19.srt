Hi!

4
00:00:16,136 --> 00:00:17,427
How was your flight?

5
00:00:17,512 --> 00:00:19,381
Ah, it was fine.
Thanks, Meredith.

6
00:00:19,465 --> 00:00:20,692
I mean, Maggie.

7
00:00:20,777 --> 00:00:22,442
Maggie. Sorry.

8
00:00:22,527 --> 00:00:24,036
Someone didn't sleep
on the plane.

9
00:00:24,121 --> 00:00:25,129
Oh, I couldn't.

10
00:00:25,214 --> 00:00:27,872
I've rewritten my talk
at least 20 times.

11
00:00:28,921 --> 00:00:31,087
Meredith is so sorry
she can't be here.

12
00:00:31,171 --> 00:00:32,574
Babysitter got the flu.

13
00:00:32,711 --> 00:00:34,421
Oh. Well, I'm glad
you're here.

Ah, I put my blood, sweat,
and tears into this PATH pen.

20

I can't wait to
share it with the world.

22
00:00:56,314 --> 00:00:58,690
You're... You're jumping too far

00:00:59,029 --> 00:01:00,269

regret bringing you. Let's go.

30
00:01:14,478 --> 00:01:15,894
Just missed it.

00:01:16,253 --> 00:01:17,297

32
00:01:17,389 --> 00:01:18,634

Dr. Hayes.

37
00:01:26,359 --> 00:01:27,907
I really hope I wasn't
supposed to bring my kids.

38
00:01:27,992 --> 00:01:29,198
No, their, uh, their

00:01:29,581 --> 00:01:30,837

- Oh.

00:01:30,921 --> 00:01:32,207
..it's a chance for them
to see family.

41
00:01:32,291 --> 00:01:33,425
Well, I am heading

60
00:02:30,731 --> 00:02:32,407
Aren't you going
to invite me in?

61
00:02:32,492 --> 00:02:34,873
I'm not sure I believe
you're really here.

62
00:02:41,492 --> 00:02:43,608
You here to buy
the convention center?

63
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,858
Stop me from presenting?

I'm here to stop
the foolishness!

65
00:02:49,822 --> 00:02:51,686
Richard, you said
you wanted an apology.

66
00:02:51,771 --> 00:02:53,897
Well, I am sorry.

67
00:02:54,211 --> 00:02:55,627
I am so sorry.

68
00:02:55,711 --> 00:02:57,452
Truly, for everything.

69
00:02:57,641 --> 00:02:59,678

00:03:00,539 --> 00:03:01,659

00:03:02,859 --> 00:03:04,775
You don't have anything
to say back to me?

72
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,456

Gemma and me.

73
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:08,121
Mm-hmm.

74
00:03:10,596 --> 00:03:12,306
I know what I saw.

75
00:03:15,006 --> 00:03:17,607
Well, something...

76
00:03:18,173 --> 00:03:19,589
almost happened.

77
00:03:19,674 --> 00:03:22,983
W-We went to breakfast,
and she kissed me.

78
00:03:23,068 --> 00:03:24,139
Oh, Richard!

79
00:03:24,224 --> 00:03:25,310
But I stopped her.

80
00:03:25,395 --> 00:03:26,935
But you didn't tell me.

81
00:03:29,011 --> 00:03:32,295

and I'm sorry.

82
00:03:33,151 --> 00:03:35,487
Oh, Richard,
we can fix this.

83
00:03:35,586 --> 00:03:37,381
You know we can.

84
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:40,997
There are things in this world
you can't control, Catherine.

85
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:42,482
And I'm one of them.

86
00:03:42,567 --> 00:03:44,005
I don't want
to control you.

87
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:46,426
You bought my hospital,
for God's sakes!

88
00:03:46,553 --> 00:03:47,865
Because of your temper!

89
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:49,779
Worst investment
I ever made.

90
00:03:50,115 --> 00:03:51,611
It's just
hemorrhaging money.

91
00:03:51,696 --> 00:03:53,857
The foundation board thinks
it's a sign of my dementia.

92
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:55,457
I look like a fool.

93
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:57,497
No, stop.
I'm serious.

94
00:03:57,582 --> 00:03:59,005
Oh, me too.
This is funny.

95
00:03:59,107 --> 00:04:00,295
This is not funny!

96
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:01,707
You had a fight with
your husband

97
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:04,837
and purchased an entire
hospital to get back at him.

98
00:04:06,641 --> 00:04:08,977
Pac-North has
my name on it!

99
00:04:09,391 --> 00:04:10,974
My name!

100
00:04:11,059 --> 00:04:13,247
I mean, the worst place
I ever worked in my life!

101
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,810
Oh, dear Lord.

102
00:04:21,505 --> 00:04:22,685
Do you think
there's a couple

103
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:25,146
who ever had
such an expensive fight?

104
00:04:25,231 --> 00:04:26,240
No.

but they're never
people you like.

122
00:05:14,903 --> 00:05:16,419
- Aww.
- Here. I ordered one for you.

123
00:05:16,508 --> 00:05:17,568
Ooh. Thank you.

124
00:05:17,653 --> 00:05:19,871
Wow. They really splurged
for the reusable straws.

125
00:05:20,363 --> 00:05:21,506
- I'm so glad you made it.
- Mm.

126
00:05:21,591 --> 00:05:22,802

129
00:05:26,762 --> 00:05:28,678
no one

130
00:05:28,763 --> 00:05:30,732

132
00:05:31,948 --> 00:05:33,779
Yes. Thank you!

133
00:05:33,864 --> 00:05:35,224
I know these things
are kinda lame,

134
00:05:35,309 --> 00:05:37,232
but I kind of
enjoy them.

135
00:05:37,317 --> 00:05:38,513
'Cause it's like
summer camp.

136
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,083
For people who like
to cut into other people.

137
00:05:40,168 --> 00:05:41,505
I never
went to summer camp,

138
00:05:41,614 --> 00:05:44,943

139
00:05:45,028 --> 00:05:45,841
Yeah.

140
00:05:45,926 --> 00:05:47,996
Assembling the greatest
talents in the world,

141
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:49,365

in one building.

142
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:51,986
Professional by day, but
screwing each other by night?

143
00:05:52,071 --> 00:05:54,621
Y-Yeah, I meant the "gathering
of the best of the best" part.

144
00:05:54,706 --> 00:05:55,792
Is that what
the Olympic Village is like?

145
00:05:55,877 --> 00:05:56,869
Totally.

146
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:00,294
Oh, my God.

147
00:06:01,421 --> 00:06:02,501
What?

148
00:06:03,689 --> 00:06:04,716
Wow.

149
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:05,872
I mean, he's...

150
00:06:05,996 --> 00:06:07,146
Do you know him?

151
00:06:07,231 --> 00:06:08,404
Yeah.

152
00:06:08,489 --> 00:06:09,945
Uh, no, no.

153
00:06:10,112 --> 00:06:13,049
I mean, not really.
We... Uh... Sort of.

154
00:06:13,564 --> 00:06:15,845
He was one of
my residents at Tufts.

155
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:18,069
I-I doubt
he even remembers me.

156
00:06:18,154 --> 00:06:19,749
God, he is so hot!

157
00:06:19,834 --> 00:06:20,725
Am I blushing?

158
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:22,266
Maggie Pierce.
Olympic Village.

159
00:06:22,351 --> 00:06:23,888
Find out if he's single
and get yours.

160
00:06:23,973 --> 00:06:25,389
No, I don't do that.

161
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:27,108
You don't have sex?

162
00:06:27,456 --> 00:06:28,712
I don't have sex
with strangers.

163
00:06:28,797 --> 00:06:30,256
You just said
you know him.

164
00:06:30,642 --> 00:06:31,967
Also...

165
00:06:32,697 --> 00:06:33,823
he's behind you.

166
00:06:33,908 --> 00:06:35,023
What? No. No.

167
00:06:35,108 --> 00:06:36,772
- Mm-hmm.
- Maggie Pierce.

168
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:38,140
Hi...

169
00:06:39,381 --> 00:06:40,639
..you.

170
00:06:41,194 --> 00:06:42,797
You don't remember me,
do you?

171
00:06:42,881 --> 00:06:44,217
She remembers you.

172
00:06:44,844 --> 00:06:46,217
Eh, no. Yeah.

173
00:06:46,302 --> 00:06:48,808
Dr. Winston Ndugu.
We worked together at Tufts.

174
00:06:49,116 --> 00:06:50,782
- We did.
- Yeah.

175
00:06:51,248 --> 00:06:54,444
You know, I just remembered
my key isn't working,

176
00:06:54,579 --> 00:06:56,225
so I-I'm gonna
go get a new one.

177
00:06:57,237 --> 00:06:59,155
Three years
I've been coming here,

178
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,827
and this is the first time
I've seen you.

179
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:02,616
What... are you
stalking me?

180
00:07:04,584 --> 00:07:06,045
Not stalking you.

181
00:07:06,961 --> 00:07:10,006
But... seeking?
Yes.

182
00:07:11,736 --> 00:07:13,982
I'm gonna be a little forward now.
Is that okay?

183
00:07:14,067 --> 00:07:15,334
Mm-hmm.

184
00:07:15,561 --> 00:07:19,194
I have had a crush on you
since my first day of residency.

185
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:21,666
But you were my chief,
even though I'm older than you,

186
00:07:21,751 --> 00:07:23,327
which just made me
crush harder.

187
00:07:23,412 --> 00:07:25,631
So, I bided my time.

188
00:07:26,123 --> 00:07:28,350
But then you went
and moved away to Seattle,

189
00:07:28,703 --> 00:07:30,139
right before I became
an attending,

190
00:07:30,224 --> 00:07:32,139
and I never got my shot
to ask you out.

191
00:07:32,921 --> 00:07:35,428
But I see that somehow

192
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:37,264
you aren't wearing
a wedding ring.

193
00:07:37,963 --> 00:07:39,919
So, hopefully,
I still have a shot.

194
00:07:40,538 --> 00:07:43,038
Which is just
my long way of saying

195
00:07:43,211 --> 00:07:44,702
I'd like to
buy you a drink.

196
00:07:51,623 --> 00:07:53,873
<i>♪ I'm gonna live it
like I own it ♪</i>

197
00:07:56,421 --> 00:07:58,207

204

00:08:17,381 --> 00:08:19,098
<i>♪ I'm gonna live it

207
00:08:19,183 --> 00:08:21,939
Okay, we only have 36 more hours
to get to know each other,

208
00:08:22,052 --> 00:08:24,016
so I'mma do
a lightning round, alright?

209
00:08:24,101 --> 00:08:26,301
Don't think. Just answer.
You ready?

210
00:08:26,386 --> 00:08:27,434
Ready.

211
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:28,515
Favorite snack food?

212
00:08:28,713 --> 00:08:30,129
Pretzels.

213
00:08:30,331 --> 00:08:31,559
Wow.

214
00:08:31,681 --> 00:08:32,937
Failed your first question.

215
00:08:33,022 --> 00:08:34,942
How can I fail at naming
my favorite thing?

216
00:08:35,027 --> 00:08:37,113
Because pretzels are
only the favorite snack food

217
00:08:37,288 --> 00:08:39,454
of prisoners who haven't
had snacks in years

218
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:41,309
and don't remember what snacks
are supposed to taste like.

219
00:08:41,394 --> 00:08:44,301
Okay. Well, I don't fail tests,
so give me another one.

220
00:08:44,495 --> 00:08:45,832
Favorite movie.

221
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:47,316
"Amélie."

222
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:48,487
Why?

223
00:08:48,572 --> 00:08:50,911
Because it's about
hope and resilience.

224
00:08:51,963 --> 00:08:53,442
Perfect day off.

225
00:08:54,962 --> 00:08:56,739
Okay, sunrise run.

226
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:59,551
Spend the morning
at a museum,

227
00:08:59,932 --> 00:09:01,371
the afternoon in a park,

228
00:09:01,804 --> 00:09:04,473
evening cocktails
by a body of water.

229
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:09,661
A nice dinner,
and then...

230
00:09:10,107 --> 00:09:12,911
ice cream while
walking through the city.

231
00:09:13,421 --> 00:09:15,114
Bed early, with a book.

232
00:09:15,436 --> 00:09:18,668
So, your perfect night
is a romantic comedy.

233
00:09:18,753 --> 00:09:19,606
Okay.

234
00:09:19,691 --> 00:09:21,915
No, I didn't say who
I was doing all of that with.

235
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,376
Well, who are you
doing all that with?

236
00:09:23,461 --> 00:09:24,653
Me.

237
00:09:24,738 --> 00:09:26,524
So, you like
being alone?

238
00:09:26,658 --> 00:09:28,168
I do.

239
00:09:28,626 --> 00:09:29,955
To a point.

240
00:09:30,267 --> 00:09:31,563
Favorite movie.

241
00:09:31,685 --> 00:09:32,893
"Ghostbusters."

242
00:09:34,755 --> 00:09:36,121
Perfect day off.

243
00:09:36,206 --> 00:09:37,315
Wake up...

244
00:09:37,678 --> 00:09:39,384
well after sunrise.

245
00:09:40,727 --> 00:09:44,471
Roll over to
the beautiful heart surgeon

246
00:09:44,556 --> 00:09:46,174
in bed beside me.

247
00:09:46,515 --> 00:09:50,049
Do that thing to her
that makes her lower back arch.

248
00:10:08,366 --> 00:10:09,736
Okay.

249
00:10:11,436 --> 00:10:13,142
No more lightning round.

250
00:10:14,478 --> 00:10:17,434
Who is your favorite person
in the whole world?

251
00:10:17,751 --> 00:10:18,908
My mom.

252
00:10:19,835 --> 00:10:22,245
She was my protector.

253
00:10:23,212 --> 00:10:26,276
She was
this fierce mama lion.

254
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,354
She didn't let anyone
mess with me.

255
00:10:29,407 --> 00:10:31,283
Including my dad.

256
00:10:31,476 --> 00:10:32,869
She died...

257
00:10:34,979 --> 00:10:36,572
..about two years ago.

258
00:10:37,617 --> 00:10:39,153
Ovarian cancer.

259
00:10:39,238 --> 00:10:40,494
Oh, my God.

260
00:10:40,671 --> 00:10:41,807
Yeah.

261
00:10:42,171 --> 00:10:43,885
It happened really fast.

262
00:10:44,947 --> 00:10:47,096
My mom died
two years ago.

263
00:10:47,764 --> 00:10:49,080
Breast cancer.

264
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:51,314
No, actually, it was
three years ago.

265
00:10:51,461 --> 00:10:52,901
God.

266
00:10:53,227 --> 00:10:55,244
I can't believe
it's been that long.

267
00:10:55,428 --> 00:10:57,182
There's nothing worse
than watching

268
00:10:57,284 --> 00:10:59,625
the woman who protected you
from the world

269
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:01,182
get sicker and sicker

270
00:11:01,515 --> 00:11:03,877
and you not be able
to fix her.

271
00:11:06,956 --> 00:11:08,549
Okay, so...

272
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:10,676
do you do this?

273
00:11:10,761 --> 00:11:13,744
Do you have
med conference flings?

274
00:11:14,565 --> 00:11:17,611
I can't say that I've never
hooked up at one of these.

275
00:11:17,803 --> 00:11:20,057
But I've never done this.

276
00:11:21,621 --> 00:11:23,167
What's this?

277
00:11:23,596 --> 00:11:26,621
Falling this hard
in one night.

278
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:30,646
Me neither.

279
00:11:37,065 --> 00:11:38,869
These conferences
are all the same.

280
00:11:39,588 --> 00:11:42,310
Yep. Just
a sea of desperation.

281
00:11:42,565 --> 00:11:44,842
Sales reps trying
to unload their equipment

282
00:11:44,927 --> 00:11:46,186
before it becomes
obsolete.

283
00:11:46,271 --> 00:11:47,272
Or banned.

284
00:11:47,364 --> 00:11:49,029
Wow. Really sounds
like your scene.

285
00:11:49,114 --> 00:11:50,710
If you hate it so much,
why'd you come?

286
00:11:50,795 --> 00:11:52,200
Well, I'm the new guy.

287
00:11:52,285 --> 00:11:54,763
And Bailey asked me
to come represent peds.

288
00:11:54,848 --> 00:11:57,482
Didn't seem like an invitation
I should turn down.

289
00:11:57,944 --> 00:11:59,607
The boys get to see
their aunt, so...

290
00:11:59,699 --> 00:12:01,419
Which is your sister or...

291
00:12:01,536 --> 00:12:03,215
- Sister-in-law.
- Mm.

292
00:12:03,386 --> 00:12:05,068
Evening, doctors.

293
00:12:05,153 --> 00:12:06,833
Dane Pinetti.
I'm with Wilkes and Boon.

294
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:09,762
Teddy Altman.
Grey-Sloan. In Seattle.

295
00:12:11,995 --> 00:12:14,021
You look like a man
in need of something.

296
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:17,200
Do I?
And what might that be?

297
00:12:19,439 --> 00:12:20,695
Hmm.

298
00:12:20,795 --> 00:12:22,497
Not quite sure what
to make of this.

299
00:12:22,664 --> 00:12:25,114
Well, you, uh...

300
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,696
you click the little part
at the back,

301
00:12:27,826 --> 00:12:29,997
and you write
with the front.

302
00:12:30,224 --> 00:12:31,857
Mm.
It's called a pen.

303
00:12:32,296 --> 00:12:33,755
Courtesy of Thrivea,

304
00:12:33,847 --> 00:12:35,675
who make erectile
dysfunction medication.

305
00:12:36,386 --> 00:12:37,403
They do?

306
00:12:37,488 --> 00:12:39,159
You don't even know
what your own company makes?

307
00:12:39,244 --> 00:12:40,789
My friend said
a company at a convention

308
00:12:40,874 --> 00:12:42,044
was paying 500 bucks,

309
00:12:42,129 --> 00:12:43,885
and all I had to do
was hand out pens and smile.

310
00:12:45,091 --> 00:12:47,137
That might not sound
like much to a doctor,

311
00:12:47,222 --> 00:12:49,974
but to a starving artist,
that's rent.

312
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:52,911
Oh. No wonder no guys
want these pens.

313
00:12:55,587 --> 00:12:56,989
What kind of artist?

314
00:12:57,074 --> 00:12:58,067
Apart from starving?

315
00:12:58,152 --> 00:12:59,419
Mixed media.

316
00:12:59,504 --> 00:13:02,080
A lot of multiple exposures
and instant film transfers.

317
00:13:02,294 --> 00:13:03,419
Mm.

318
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:05,521
That doesn't make any sense
to you, does it?

319
00:13:05,606 --> 00:13:06,825
No, the individual
words do...

320
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:08,116
Just not when you
put them together.

321
00:13:10,341 --> 00:13:11,817
So, what are you
drinking?

322
00:13:12,169 --> 00:13:13,341
I'd like to.

323
00:13:13,426 --> 00:13:15,942
But these are not gonna
hand themselves out.

324
00:13:16,915 --> 00:13:18,200
Well...

325
00:13:20,295 --> 00:13:22,021
I go through
a lot of pens.

326
00:13:23,485 --> 00:13:24,950
So, how about that drink?

327
00:13:27,251 --> 00:13:28,786
<i>Watching the debates...</i>

328
00:13:28,871 --> 00:13:30,497
They said just
a couple more minutes.

329
00:13:32,123 --> 00:13:33,732
Okay.

330
00:13:34,205 --> 00:13:36,091
This is happening.

331
00:13:36,325 --> 00:13:40,192
Are you sure they don't need
a few more, like, years?

332
00:13:40,504 --> 00:13:41,548
Babe, this is...

333
00:13:41,633 --> 00:13:44,560
A hysterectomy
on a 33-year-old.

334
00:13:44,702 --> 00:13:46,498
They're removing
an important part of me.

335
00:13:46,606 --> 00:13:48,325
And if you say
"Not a big deal,"

336
00:13:48,426 --> 00:13:50,564
I am going to kill you...
In front of our sons...

337
00:13:50,649 --> 00:13:52,155
And it will
be your fault.

338
00:13:52,295 --> 00:13:53,927
I was gonna say "routine,"
but...

339
00:13:55,915 --> 00:13:57,138
The surgeon we found...

340
00:13:57,232 --> 00:13:58,768
She's done more of these
than I can even count.

341
00:13:58,853 --> 00:14:01,399
She's minimally invasive,
fast recovery time,

342
00:14:01,484 --> 00:14:02,842
low post-op
complications.

343
00:14:02,927 --> 00:14:05,013
You're in amazing hands.
She's great, really.

344
00:14:05,098 --> 00:14:08,080
Or I'll bleed out
or she'll cut into my bladder

345
00:14:08,165 --> 00:14:10,896
or I'll get a horrible
infection and die.

346
00:14:11,046 --> 00:14:14,146
Well, in that case,
me and the boys will move on.

347
00:14:14,736 --> 00:14:17,072
Don't get me wrong...
It'll be a tough couple of days.

348
00:14:17,187 --> 00:14:20,138
Then single women will start
showing up with casseroles.

349
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,677
I mean, I won't even have to
try. They'll feel so bad for me.

350
00:14:22,762 --> 00:14:25,154
- Ohh.
- I mean... surgeon.

351
00:14:25,404 --> 00:14:26,541
Sexy widower.

352
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:27,919
Single dad.

353
00:14:28,052 --> 00:14:29,751
I mean, I'll be... I'll be
batting them away, honestly.

354
00:14:29,835 --> 00:14:31,021
Uh-huh. Right.

355
00:14:31,374 --> 00:14:32,573
I hate you.

356
00:14:32,658 --> 00:14:34,118
I love you.

357
00:14:36,054 --> 00:14:38,720
Mrs. Douglas at school
had skin cancer,

358
00:14:38,805 --> 00:14:40,403
and she's fine now.

359
00:14:40,684 --> 00:14:42,692
That's
a different cancer.

360
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,833
Oh.

361
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:48,599
But that's really nice
to hear, honey.

362
00:14:49,334 --> 00:14:52,060
Hey, could you boys
go find Mommy a ginger ale?

363
00:14:52,601 --> 00:14:54,227
- It'll make me feel better.
- Okay.

364
00:15:04,851 --> 00:15:06,631
Mrs. Douglas is the one
who accused him of

365
00:15:06,716 --> 00:15:08,502
writing swear words
on his desk.

366
00:15:08,665 --> 00:15:09,786
She's a monster.

367
00:15:09,889 --> 00:15:11,505
I need you
to listen to me.

368
00:15:12,006 --> 00:15:13,462
The nurse should be
here by now.

369
00:15:13,547 --> 00:15:14,917
If this doesn't work...

370
00:15:16,255 --> 00:15:17,653
It has to work.

371
00:15:18,255 --> 00:15:20,685
It's the second
clinical trial we've tried.

372
00:15:21,693 --> 00:15:24,661
We're at the end of this.
I'm not gonna be okay.

373
00:15:25,361 --> 00:15:27,997
I've seen people bounce back
from far worse than this.

374
00:15:28,082 --> 00:15:32,101
It is likely that you're gonna
be doing this alone soon,

375
00:15:32,186 --> 00:15:34,131
so I need you to listen.

376
00:15:34,834 --> 00:15:36,264
No.

377
00:15:36,919 --> 00:15:37,965
I'm not.

378
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:42,295
Make sure the boys know
it's okay to cry.

379
00:15:43,045 --> 00:15:44,711
To feel it.

380
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:46,397
To feel everything.

381
00:15:47,032 --> 00:15:48,828
I don't want them
locking this up

382
00:15:48,913 --> 00:15:51,022
and letting it
eat away at them.

383
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:53,126
Don't be strong.

384
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:56,256
Be a mess.

385
00:15:56,535 --> 00:15:59,071
Let them know that
it's okay to fall apart.

386
00:15:59,186 --> 00:16:01,178
Please don't do this.

387
00:16:01,263 --> 00:16:04,349
And promise me that you're gonna
let the boys see my sister.

00:16:15,998 --> 00:16:17,671
just call your mother.

393
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:20,627

394
00:16:20,984 --> 00:16:23,654

00:16:25,045 --> 00:16:27,929

396
00:16:28,014 --> 00:16:29,014
Yeah.

397
00:16:29,099 --> 00:16:31,685
I told him that he'll get better
if he keeps practicing,

398
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:34,334

it's hopeless.

399

00:16:43,824 --> 00:16:46,440

432
00:18:45,435 --> 00:18:46,688

00:18:48,076 --> 00:18:49,992
Do you always sell this hard

434
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:51,500
Well, not everyone here

435
00:18:51,585 --> 00:18:53,871
works for Catherine Fox's
flagship hospital.

436
00:18:53,955 --> 00:18:55,970
Maybe you should
take up your business with her.

437
00:18:56,055 --> 00:18:57,892
You know how hard it is to get
face time with that woman?

438
00:18:57,977 --> 00:18:58,688
Mm.

439
00:18:58,773 --> 00:19:00,309
Listen, this is a really
exciting opportunity.

440
00:19:00,394 --> 00:19:02,634
Wilkes and Boon is
looking to expand R&D

441
00:19:02,719 --> 00:19:04,095
beyond our laboratories.

442
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,727
We want to partner with
the right hospital

443
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:07,638
and develop side by side
with you.

444
00:19:07,837 --> 00:19:08,883
That actually
could be something...

445
00:19:08,975 --> 00:19:10,558
I know all about
your devices.

446
00:19:10,737 --> 00:19:12,710
I know about
the c-30 power morcellator.

447
00:19:12,795 --> 00:19:14,089
Do you know about
that one, Dane?

448
00:19:14,174 --> 00:19:16,470
Of course. It's our most
popular model on the market.

449
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,339
I bet you'll say
it's magic.

450
00:19:18,424 --> 00:19:19,746
What is it?

451
00:19:19,831 --> 00:19:21,847
It allows for minimally
invasive hysterectomies.

452
00:19:21,932 --> 00:19:24,298
Its little spinning claws
chop up fibroids,

453
00:19:24,383 --> 00:19:25,965
make them disappear.

454
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:27,293
But there's a problem.

455
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,425
This fibroid...

456
00:19:31,606 --> 00:19:33,142
isn't a fibroid.

457
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:34,593
It's cancer.

458
00:19:34,794 --> 00:19:37,082
But there's no way
of knowing that before you cut.

459
00:19:37,535 --> 00:19:39,934
And along comes
your morcellator, and...

460
00:19:40,995 --> 00:19:42,621
What... the hell, man?

461
00:19:42,705 --> 00:19:44,081
What started out

462
00:19:44,165 --> 00:19:46,791
as nicely contained,
easily removable

463
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:48,894
has now spread
countless cancer cells

464
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:50,394
all throughout
the patient's body.

465
00:19:50,479 --> 00:19:54,815
Cancer that metastasizes
and grows and can't be stopped.

466
00:19:54,904 --> 00:19:59,360
Less than 1% of benign fibroids
turn into uterine sarcomas.

467
00:19:59,484 --> 00:20:03,020
My wife was
one of those 1%.

468
00:20:03,494 --> 00:20:05,089
Her name was Abigail.

469
00:20:05,703 --> 00:20:08,119
Your device took her.

470
00:20:08,242 --> 00:20:10,158
It took the mother
of my sons.

471
00:20:10,243 --> 00:20:11,869
And you still sell
the thing,

472
00:20:11,954 --> 00:20:13,460
even though you know
it can kill,

473
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:15,041
and you pay
to suppress the proof.

474
00:20:15,126 --> 00:20:16,003
So, no.

475
00:20:17,342 --> 00:20:18,852
I don't want your drink.

476
00:20:19,653 --> 00:20:21,790
And you're lucky
I haven't already put that pen

477
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:23,485
through your throat.

478
00:20:24,455 --> 00:20:25,711

528
00:22:39,235 --> 00:22:42,282
I can't argue that
or totally explain it.

529
00:22:43,025 --> 00:22:45,119
I mean, the closest
I've come

530
00:22:45,236 --> 00:22:47,978
to making any sense of it
is that I-I...

531
00:22:48,626 --> 00:22:50,440
I wanted to support
the soldiers

532
00:22:50,533 --> 00:22:52,604
who were trying to get
the people that killed Allison,

533
00:22:52,689 --> 00:22:54,831
and I-I know that
it's not a straight line,

534
00:22:54,916 --> 00:22:56,695
but at the time,
it was...

535
00:22:57,345 --> 00:22:58,445
Mm.

536
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:01,252
There wasn't much
that made sense.

537
00:23:04,935 --> 00:23:07,095
It's hard to explain
to people who weren't there.

538
00:23:09,296 --> 00:23:10,676
I miss her.

539
00:23:12,033 --> 00:23:13,315
You miss her?

540
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:17,065
Every day of every week
of every year of my life.

541
00:23:17,267 --> 00:23:19,159
I don't know why this stuff
always happens to me.

542
00:23:19,244 --> 00:23:21,155
Never to you guys.
Only to me.

543
00:23:21,278 --> 00:23:23,018
I swear to God...
Here's another.

544
00:23:23,103 --> 00:23:24,315
Thank you.

545
00:23:24,744 --> 00:23:26,174
This guy was
clipping his toenails...

546
00:23:26,259 --> 00:23:27,065
Oh.

547
00:23:27,149 --> 00:23:29,855
...on the subway
at rush hour.

548
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,445
Only in New York.

549
00:23:35,025 --> 00:23:36,564
Alright,
I gotta go to bed.

550
00:23:36,789 --> 00:23:38,955
Early morning
layout meeting tomorrow.

551
00:23:39,091 --> 00:23:40,167
Boo.

552
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:40,995
It's only 10:00.

553
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,792
I'm not superhuman
like you two.

554
00:23:42,877 --> 00:23:44,690
I can't survive on
three hours' sleep

555
00:23:44,775 --> 00:23:46,167
and then do surgery
for 12 hours.

556
00:23:46,252 --> 00:23:47,260
16.

557
00:23:47,345 --> 00:23:48,667
Exactly.

558
00:23:48,752 --> 00:23:49,655
Mm.

559
00:23:49,739 --> 00:23:51,445
Please don't stay up
too late.

560
00:23:51,529 --> 00:23:53,618
I need this booty rubbing up
against me in bed.

561
00:23:53,703 --> 00:23:55,515
<i>♪ Till I'd passed
and left them alone ♪</i>

562
00:23:55,662 --> 00:23:57,455
I will be soon.
Okay.

563
00:23:58,634 --> 00:24:00,065
No!

564
00:24:00,149 --> 00:24:01,869
No!

565
00:24:01,954 --> 00:24:03,580
I got nothing.
Must be vascular.

566
00:24:03,665 --> 00:24:05,377
Oh, yeah.
That's me.

567
00:24:07,016 --> 00:24:08,346
Okay.

568
00:24:10,563 --> 00:24:12,533
- I'll see you later.
- Mm.

569
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:14,181
Please be careful.

570
00:24:14,266 --> 00:24:16,110
Uptown is scary
this time of night.

571
00:24:16,196 --> 00:24:17,431
Alright.

572
00:24:17,516 --> 00:24:18,958
Look after my girl,
Altman.

573
00:24:19,043 --> 00:24:19,900
I'll try.

574
00:24:19,985 --> 00:24:21,485
- Night, babe.
- Bye.

575
00:24:24,601 --> 00:24:27,135
<i>♪ For the prettiest girl
in the room ♪</i>

576
00:24:28,199 --> 00:24:30,275
<i>♪ And God help you

577
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,525
You okay?

578
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:33,266
Yeah. Just, uh...

579
00:24:33,476 --> 00:24:34,734
Just tired.

580
00:24:34,819 --> 00:24:36,252
You have to
work tomorrow?

581
00:24:36,337 --> 00:24:37,570
Yeah. All day.

582
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:38,905
Bummer.

583
00:24:38,989 --> 00:24:41,408
I was gonna see if you wanted
to come to work with me tomorrow

584
00:24:41,493 --> 00:24:43,490
and have fancy breakfast
at Windows on the World.

585
00:24:43,575 --> 00:24:45,868
You just said you have
a layout meeting all morning.

586
00:24:47,682 --> 00:24:49,511
So I could have breakfast
with you.

587
00:25:03,356 --> 00:25:04,790
I had a baby.

588
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:07,111
Congratulations!
Thanks.

589
00:25:07,196 --> 00:25:09,688
- Uh, pictures, please.
- Oh. Yeah, here.

590
00:25:11,981 --> 00:25:13,658
Oh, my goodness!

591
00:25:13,743 --> 00:25:15,126
She's perfect!

592
00:25:15,211 --> 00:25:16,751
Look at those cheeks!

593
00:25:16,836 --> 00:25:17,884
Ohh!
What's her name?

594
00:25:17,969 --> 00:25:19,438
Allison.

595
00:25:21,586 --> 00:25:22,962
That seems odd.

596
00:25:23,047 --> 00:25:24,423
What?

597
00:25:24,508 --> 00:25:25,790
To name your daughter
after...

598
00:25:25,875 --> 00:25:27,275
My best friend?

599
00:25:27,805 --> 00:25:30,695
It's been almost
20 years, Teddy.

600
00:25:31,326 --> 00:25:32,532
You can admit it.

601
00:25:32,771 --> 00:25:33,941
Admit...?

602
00:25:36,016 --> 00:25:38,556
When Allison first told me
that she met this amazing girl

603
00:25:38,641 --> 00:25:40,281
and wanted her
to move in...

604
00:25:41,274 --> 00:25:44,727
I remember thinking,
"She's not a lesbian. Perfect."

605
00:25:44,836 --> 00:25:46,696
In fact,
she made me promise

606
00:25:46,781 --> 00:25:48,454
that I wouldn't
like you better than her

607
00:25:48,539 --> 00:25:50,115
since we're both doctors.

608
00:25:50,383 --> 00:25:51,814
The last thing I expected

609
00:25:51,899 --> 00:25:53,485
was for the two of you
to get together.

610
00:26:02,679 --> 00:26:04,305
Tell me again.

611
00:26:04,946 --> 00:26:06,961
You were wearing
your flowered dress

612
00:26:07,047 --> 00:26:08,626
with your combat boots,

613
00:26:08,711 --> 00:26:11,445
and you were riding
a bike.

614
00:26:11,883 --> 00:26:13,829
The one with the basket
in the front...

615
00:26:13,914 --> 00:26:16,236
..and it was filled
with fake birds.

616
00:26:16,321 --> 00:26:18,617
Oh, my God.
I'm so embarrassed by me.

617
00:26:18,844 --> 00:26:20,603
Shh. I'm telling it.

618
00:26:20,688 --> 00:26:21,790
- Okay.
- Okay.

619
00:26:21,875 --> 00:26:23,290
And then you almost hit me

620
00:26:23,375 --> 00:26:24,715
because I was
crossing the street

621
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:25,867
and I was looking
at a map,

622
00:26:25,952 --> 00:26:27,164
and then I looked up,
and I said...

623
00:26:27,249 --> 00:26:29,750
"Get those birds
out of my way, Pollyanna!"

624
00:26:29,835 --> 00:26:32,719
I was stressed.
I was a first year attending.

625
00:26:33,567 --> 00:26:35,273
You were mean.

626
00:26:35,459 --> 00:26:37,039
And beautiful.

627
00:26:37,419 --> 00:26:39,925
And I feel desperately
in love with you on sight.

628
00:26:40,009 --> 00:26:41,425
You did not.

629
00:26:41,509 --> 00:26:42,875
Okay, I kinda
hated you at first.

630
00:26:42,959 --> 00:26:44,539
You were in the bike lane.

631
00:26:44,624 --> 00:26:46,674
I know. I'm sorry.

632
00:26:49,008 --> 00:26:51,378
But I bought you
a bagel anyway.

633
00:26:52,826 --> 00:26:54,952
I'm so lucky you did.

634
00:27:03,884 --> 00:27:05,094
Allison.

635
00:27:05,179 --> 00:27:06,400
Mm.

636
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:09,118
I can't...

637
00:27:10,469 --> 00:27:12,439
I can't keep doing this.

638
00:27:13,119 --> 00:27:14,220
Kissing me?

639
00:27:14,338 --> 00:27:16,470
No, I just...
I can't keep sneaking around

640
00:27:16,629 --> 00:27:17,875
and lying to Claire.

641
00:27:17,959 --> 00:27:19,470
She's our best friend.

642
00:27:19,645 --> 00:27:21,079
Oh.

643
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:23,730
I know.
Oh. I know.

644
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,526
I'm an awful person.

645
00:27:26,611 --> 00:27:28,567
No.

646
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:31,697
You are the best person.

647
00:27:39,669 --> 00:27:41,089
I'm telling her.

648
00:27:42,095 --> 00:27:43,289
I'm telling her tomorrow.

649
00:27:43,374 --> 00:27:44,478
Then what?

650
00:27:44,563 --> 00:27:46,665
W-We all come home
to the apartment that we share

651
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:49,236
and help her pack up
and move out?

652
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:53,156
Or we could move out.

653
00:27:53,241 --> 00:27:55,674
And then she's stuck
with three shares of the rent?

654
00:27:57,129 --> 00:27:59,009
You're right. I know.

655
00:28:02,129 --> 00:28:04,549
But I can't keep
lying to her, either.

656
00:28:05,806 --> 00:28:07,767
I love her.

657
00:28:10,831 --> 00:28:12,207
And I love you more.

658
00:28:12,292 --> 00:28:13,622
Don't say that.

659
00:28:17,293 --> 00:28:18,986
Okay, say it again.

660
00:28:20,302 --> 00:28:22,142
I love you more.

661
00:28:25,229 --> 00:28:27,197
I love you more.

662
00:28:31,008 --> 00:28:33,294
- Mm.
- I love you more.

663
00:28:41,318 --> 00:28:42,864
How long did you know?

664
00:28:42,994 --> 00:28:44,463
I suspected for months.

665
00:28:44,548 --> 00:28:45,798
Mm.

666
00:28:46,245 --> 00:28:48,189
Did you ever stop and think
about what it would do to me,

667
00:28:48,274 --> 00:28:49,400
or did you just not care?

668
00:28:49,485 --> 00:28:51,401
No, it tore me up,
Claire. I...

669
00:28:51,486 --> 00:28:53,026
But not enough to stop.

670
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:59,136
I requested her phone records
after she died.

671
00:28:59,564 --> 00:29:03,470
I kept trying to imagine her
in those last minutes.

672
00:29:04,297 --> 00:29:07,697
"What did she do? What did
she see? Was she in pain?"

673
00:29:08,919 --> 00:29:10,611
So I got
her phone records,

674
00:29:10,847 --> 00:29:14,893
from that... that clunky
little Nokia she had.

675
00:29:15,181 --> 00:29:17,557
And I found out that
you were the last person

676
00:29:17,642 --> 00:29:19,012
she tried to call.

677
00:29:20,134 --> 00:29:22,064
At 8:57 a.m.

678
00:29:22,947 --> 00:29:25,603
On September 11, 2001.

679
00:29:26,411 --> 00:29:29,962
Allison Robin Brown tried
to call you, Teddy Altman,

680
00:29:30,047 --> 00:29:34,298
as the Twin Towers
fell around her,

681
00:29:34,383 --> 00:29:36,009
as she...

682
00:29:36,094 --> 00:29:37,908
As she fell
out of the sky.

683
00:29:38,851 --> 00:29:40,126
Not me.

684
00:29:40,297 --> 00:29:41,330
Not her parents.

685
00:29:41,415 --> 00:29:42,626
You.

686
00:29:43,009 --> 00:29:44,585
That's how I found out.

687
00:29:49,759 --> 00:29:53,009
She was
the love of my life.

688
00:29:54,653 --> 00:29:56,369
And you were
the love of hers.

689
00:30:02,719 --> 00:30:04,005
Take care, Teddy.

690
00:30:13,818 --> 00:30:15,830
There was this one time
you let me scrub in

691
00:30:16,049 --> 00:30:17,965
on a piggyback transplant.

692
00:30:18,049 --> 00:30:19,759
Oh, my God.
I was so nervous.

693
00:30:20,149 --> 00:30:22,645
I was afraid I was gonna drop
the donor heart on the OR floor.

694
00:30:24,367 --> 00:30:26,073
This is so crazy.

695
00:30:26,509 --> 00:30:29,259
'Cause that is how I felt
every single time I saw you.

696
00:30:30,959 --> 00:30:33,505
Except in the OR, because
in there, I'm a superhero.

697
00:30:33,589 --> 00:30:37,635
But in regular life,
I am a neurotic mess.

698
00:30:37,719 --> 00:30:39,375
I do not see that.

699
00:30:39,459 --> 00:30:40,619
I guess...

700
00:30:41,731 --> 00:30:43,107
I'm not.

701
00:30:43,192 --> 00:30:44,564
With you.

702
00:30:45,031 --> 00:30:47,187
I mean, at least not
for the last few hours.

703
00:30:47,341 --> 00:30:48,517
Mm.

704
00:30:53,459 --> 00:30:55,214
For the last 12 hours?

705
00:30:55,299 --> 00:30:57,056
Is it morning?!

706
00:30:57,307 --> 00:30:59,267
Oh, my God!

707
00:31:03,572 --> 00:31:05,416
Oh, look.
The sunrise.

708
00:31:05,564 --> 00:31:06,755
It's time for your run.

709
00:31:11,219 --> 00:31:12,675
Which talks
are you going to?

710
00:31:12,759 --> 00:31:16,585
Um..."Bioethics
in Crisis Zones"

711
00:31:16,669 --> 00:31:19,335
and "Innovations in Pathology:
Presenting"...

712
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:20,795
The PATH pen!

713
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:22,057
That's Richard's talk.

714
00:31:22,143 --> 00:31:23,349
And Richard is...?

715
00:31:23,434 --> 00:31:25,705
My biological dad.
Remember? I told you.

716
00:31:25,838 --> 00:31:27,854
Oh, right. Yeah.
Richard.

717
00:31:28,489 --> 00:31:30,794
So, is it gonna be weird
if I meet this man

718
00:31:30,879 --> 00:31:32,237
on what amounts
to our first date?

719
00:31:32,322 --> 00:31:34,078
Yeah.
Incredibly weird.

720
00:31:34,244 --> 00:31:35,548
Yeah.

721
00:31:36,115 --> 00:31:38,658
But everything about this night
has been weird.

722
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:40,565
Weird and...

723
00:31:40,737 --> 00:31:42,135
Mm.

724
00:31:42,219 --> 00:31:44,009
...perfect.

725
00:31:48,379 --> 00:31:49,669
Mm.

726
00:31:52,415 --> 00:31:54,205
Conference.

727
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,295
Advancement.

728
00:31:57,379 --> 00:31:59,005
Mm-hmm.

729
00:31:59,089 --> 00:32:00,635
Expanding our minds.

730
00:32:00,719 --> 00:32:02,755
- Right.
- Mm-hmm.

731
00:32:02,839 --> 00:32:04,799
Surgical.

732
00:32:05,667 --> 00:32:07,373
Innovation.

733
00:32:07,629 --> 00:32:09,045
Technology.

734
00:32:17,049 --> 00:32:18,835
Mmmmmmm.

735
00:32:19,057 --> 00:32:20,230
Hi there.

736
00:32:20,315 --> 00:32:22,255
Mm.

737
00:32:22,339 --> 00:32:23,755
Good morning, Cleopatra.

738
00:32:25,579 --> 00:32:26,869
Oh. There's coffee.

739
00:32:26,954 --> 00:32:28,204
Mm.

740
00:32:28,587 --> 00:32:30,429
You know,
maybe it's okay

741
00:32:30,514 --> 00:32:32,244
that we fight
like cats and dogs.

742
00:32:33,839 --> 00:32:35,045
Maybe
if we stopped fighting,

743
00:32:35,129 --> 00:32:36,971
that's when we need
to start to worry.

744
00:32:40,419 --> 00:32:41,776
Now...

745
00:32:42,054 --> 00:32:45,854
healthy cells
never stop dividing.

746
00:32:46,379 --> 00:32:48,585
It's not until they're harmed
in... in some way

747
00:32:48,669 --> 00:32:50,401
that growth stops.

748
00:32:52,219 --> 00:32:54,283
But cancer cells...

749
00:32:55,256 --> 00:32:59,472
they keep growing even if
the conditions aren't ideal.

750
00:32:59,571 --> 00:33:03,067
Baby, please tell me you're
not comparing us to cancer.

751
00:33:03,152 --> 00:33:07,278
Okay, the problem isn't that
cancer cells keep growing.

752
00:33:07,549 --> 00:33:11,213
It's that
the good cells... stop.

753
00:33:11,629 --> 00:33:13,182

754
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:15,035

755
00:33:15,697 --> 00:33:16,823
Ohh!

756
00:33:18,376 --> 00:33:19,619
You have to make
that presentation

757
00:33:19,704 --> 00:33:21,174
in a couple of hours.

758
00:33:21,259 --> 00:33:22,237
You better hurry up.

759
00:33:22,345 --> 00:33:24,088

Hey.

764
00:33:34,759 --> 00:33:36,256
Do I smell like sex?

765
00:33:36,596 --> 00:33:37,964
I mean, I took a shower,
but I just...

766
00:33:38,049 --> 00:33:39,795
I'm not sure
I got it all off.

767
00:33:40,089 --> 00:33:42,240
Do you really want me
to smell you?

768
00:33:42,361 --> 00:33:43,897
I just never knew
it was possible

769
00:33:43,982 --> 00:33:46,888

that you know so little.

774
00:34:09,747 --> 00:34:11,333
Claire,
I owe you an apology.

775
00:34:11,418 --> 00:34:12,584
No, you don't.

776
00:34:12,669 --> 00:34:14,625
I had too many free drinks
last night.

777
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:16,756
It was 20 years ago.
Bygones.

778
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:19,754
It's not bygones.
I mean, not even a little bit.

779
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:22,560
And... we both know it.

780
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,803
I met the father of my daughter
in Afghanistan

781
00:34:27,888 --> 00:34:29,085
after Allison died,

782
00:34:29,169 --> 00:34:31,146
and he saved me
from a grief so huge,

783
00:34:31,231 --> 00:34:33,357
I probably
would have let it kill me.

784
00:34:33,698 --> 00:34:37,364
And for years, I loved him
so much, I felt guilty.

785
00:34:37,449 --> 00:34:40,535
Guilty for loving him
half as much as I loved Allison.

786
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:43,406
Guilty because he was
with someone else.

787
00:34:43,491 --> 00:34:44,781
And guilty because...

788
00:34:48,002 --> 00:34:50,193
...because maybe
I wasn't capable

789
00:34:50,277 --> 00:34:53,060
of letting someone
love me fully.

790
00:34:54,854 --> 00:34:57,638
And Allison
did love me, yes.

791
00:34:58,823 --> 00:35:00,966
But she loved you,
too, Claire.

792
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,326
Allison was in love
with the both of us.

793
00:35:04,511 --> 00:35:06,254
And at the time,
I didn't believe it.

794
00:35:06,339 --> 00:35:07,677
I...

795
00:35:07,876 --> 00:35:11,634
I thought no one could love
more than one person at once.

796
00:35:11,719 --> 00:35:13,560
I... I thought...

797
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:17,904
I thought love couldn't
be divided like that.

798
00:35:18,198 --> 00:35:19,864
But now I do.

799
00:35:20,043 --> 00:35:21,521
I believe it.

800
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:24,556
And I am sorry
for the lies,

801
00:35:24,641 --> 00:35:27,084
and I'm sorry
for the betrayal.

802
00:35:27,446 --> 00:35:30,529
I was a bad friend,
and I was selfish.

803
00:35:31,135 --> 00:35:34,138
And I never, ever meant
to hurt you.

804
00:35:35,251 --> 00:35:41,841
<i>♪ I promise
I'll do anything you ask ♪</i>

805
00:35:41,949 --> 00:35:44,825
I could never stay mad
at anybody for loving Allison.

806
00:35:47,156 --> 00:35:48,676
She's Allison.

807
00:35:59,930 --> 00:36:00,958
Ah.

808
00:36:01,043 --> 00:36:03,119
Honey. I think
I've cracked it.

809
00:36:03,319 --> 00:36:04,785
That's great, dear.

810
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:05,996
Alright. Okay.

811
00:36:06,219 --> 00:36:08,795
So, here we go.
Um...

812
00:36:08,879 --> 00:36:10,131
"Thank you very much.

813
00:36:10,216 --> 00:36:13,962
I can't tell you what an honor
it is to be here."

814
00:36:14,089 --> 00:36:15,635
 Well, wait.
Why don't you make it funny?

815
00:36:15,719 --> 00:36:17,170
Make a joke of it.

816
00:36:17,339 --> 00:36:18,965
Oh. That's a good point.
That's a good point.

817
00:36:19,049 --> 00:36:20,295
Joke. Yeah. Okay.

818
00:36:20,379 --> 00:36:21,607
Um...

819
00:36:21,692 --> 00:36:24,982
"Also, I can't tell you how many times

820
00:36:25,089 --> 00:36:28,185
I've rewritten
this presentation."

821
00:36:34,431 --> 00:36:35,605
Nervous?

822
00:36:35,745 --> 00:36:36,871
Energized.

823
00:36:38,394 --> 00:36:39,776
Break a leg.

824
00:36:40,157 --> 00:36:41,157
Okay.

825
00:36:47,629 --> 00:36:48,932
Look at you.

826
00:36:49,322 --> 00:36:50,408
Come back to Boston.

827
00:36:50,493 --> 00:36:51,659
What?

828
00:36:51,744 --> 00:36:52,990
With me.
Come back with me.

829
00:36:53,339 --> 00:36:54,760
You want me to...

830
00:36:55,024 --> 00:36:57,964
move back to Boston
to be with you?

831
00:36:58,049 --> 00:36:59,175
Yes.

832
00:36:59,259 --> 00:37:00,853
Or I'll move to Seattle.

833
00:37:01,184 --> 00:37:03,064
I know. It's crazy.

834
00:37:03,830 --> 00:37:05,656
But this happens,
right?

835
00:37:05,787 --> 00:37:08,807
I mean, sometimes you just
meet somebody and you know.

836
00:37:09,658 --> 00:37:11,614
And, look,
after my mom died,

837
00:37:11,761 --> 00:37:13,549
I-I've been a little bit...

838
00:37:13,779 --> 00:37:15,695
you know...
seize the day.

839
00:37:15,896 --> 00:37:17,557
"O Captain! My Captain!"

840
00:37:17,641 --> 00:37:18,861
- "Dead Poets Society."
- "Dead Poets Society."

841
00:37:18,946 --> 00:37:21,026
- It's my second favorite...
- It's my second favorite...

842
00:37:22,484 --> 00:37:24,172
So, I'm... I'm a person who...

843
00:37:24,329 --> 00:37:25,736
I need time
to make decisions.

844
00:37:25,821 --> 00:37:29,197
I need to weigh and measure
and make spreadsheets.

845
00:37:29,425 --> 00:37:30,505
Got it.

846
00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:31,675
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay.

847
00:37:31,759 --> 00:37:33,255
Take as much time
as you need.

848
00:37:33,339 --> 00:37:34,585
Get a focus group
together.

849
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:36,215
Do a
study. Write a paper.

850
00:37:36,299 --> 00:37:37,335
Okay.

851
00:37:37,419 --> 00:37:39,018
I just don't think that
I'm gonna feel

852
00:37:39,103 --> 00:37:41,309
any differently about this
in a few hours

853
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:43,158
or a few months.

854
00:37:43,379 --> 00:37:44,963
But...

855
00:37:45,807 --> 00:37:47,044
you do you.

856
00:38:06,763 --> 00:38:08,139
Over three decades

857
00:38:08,224 --> 00:38:12,435
as a surgeon, teacher,
and chief of surgery

858
00:38:12,548 --> 00:38:14,874
at Seattle's Grey-Sloan
Memorial Hospital...

859
00:38:15,075 --> 00:38:17,755
Jackson!
Nothing's showing yet.

860
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:19,965
I know, Ma. Calm down.

861
00:38:20,049 --> 00:38:21,474
You said this was
gonna work.

862
00:38:21,559 --> 00:38:22,950
Will you sit down,
please?

863
00:38:23,403 --> 00:38:24,879
I'm working on it.

864
00:38:25,684 --> 00:38:29,271
<i>Our next speaker has
built a sterling reputation.</i>

865
00:38:29,541 --> 00:38:30,957
<i>In Washington and abroad...</i>

866
00:38:31,081 --> 00:38:33,193

867
00:38:33,419 --> 00:38:35,549
<i>Everyone knows

868

Please join me in welcoming
my colleague and friend

870
00:38:44,348 --> 00:38:45,804
Dr. Richard Webber.

871
00:38:46,052 --> 00:38:47,755
Whoo-hoo!

872
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:49,585
I think I just heard
Auntie Maggie say "Whoo-hoo!"

873
00:38:49,669 --> 00:38:50,586
Me too.

874
00:38:53,154 --> 00:38:54,435
Oh, did it start?

875
00:38:54,523 --> 00:38:55,939
He's going on
right now.

876
00:38:56,219 --> 00:38:57,505
I'm sorry.

877
00:39:00,528 --> 00:39:02,368
Thank you so much, Cynthia.

878
00:39:04,753 --> 00:39:07,919
I can't tell you what an honor
it is to be here.

879
00:39:08,004 --> 00:39:09,880
Also, I can't tell you
how many times

880
00:39:09,965 --> 00:39:12,251
I've rewritten
this presentation.

881
00:39:14,777 --> 00:39:16,044
<i>I've worked hard...</i>

882
00:39:16,129 --> 00:39:17,896
He looks good.

883
00:39:17,981 --> 00:39:19,647
<i>..to develop the PATH pen...</i>

884
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:21,438
<i>I'm just pointing it out.
...but...</i>

885
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,716
that's not why I'm here anymore.

886
00:39:23,879 --> 00:39:27,545
Because this morning, with
my brilliant wife's help...

887
00:39:27,629 --> 00:39:29,263
What's that?
...I have figured out...

888
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,296
...how to cure cancer.

889
00:39:35,509 --> 00:39:38,795
Now, good cells need
favorable conditions,

890
00:39:38,879 --> 00:39:40,919
nurturing
and loving conditions.

891
00:39:42,959 --> 00:39:45,215
What is he doing?
What is happening?

892
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:46,216
I don't know.

893
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:47,794
Think of everything
in... in your life.

894
00:39:47,879 --> 00:39:51,415
Every moment, every cell,
every atom

895
00:39:51,558 --> 00:39:56,064
as having a simple positive
or negative charge,

896
00:39:56,218 --> 00:39:58,768
which is just... you know...

897
00:39:59,246 --> 00:40:01,832
good or bad, right?

898
00:40:02,041 --> 00:40:03,294
Something is wrong.

899
00:40:03,379 --> 00:40:04,956
Um...

900
00:40:05,144 --> 00:40:07,270
Okay, uh... let's see.

901
00:40:07,589 --> 00:40:08,715
<i>Um...</i>

902
00:40:08,799 --> 00:40:10,375
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

903
00:40:10,459 --> 00:40:11,557
Ah. Okay.

904
00:40:11,642 --> 00:40:14,258
So, um, now,
it's not fair to blame

905
00:40:14,459 --> 00:40:19,835
the environment or toxins
o-or... or family history.

906
00:40:19,919 --> 00:40:21,479
Um...

907
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:23,965
cells need apologies.

908
00:40:24,049 --> 00:40:25,585
Dear Lord.

909
00:40:25,669 --> 00:40:26,965
- He's drunk.
<i>- They need to know on an elemental level</i>

910
00:40:27,049 --> 00:40:28,635
<i>that we are sorry.</i>

911
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,006
What's
Uncle Richard saying?

912
00:40:30,091 --> 00:40:31,257
I don't know.

913
00:40:31,342 --> 00:40:32,807
Will you go grab my phone?

914
00:40:34,472 --> 00:40:35,598
Um...

915
00:40:36,158 --> 00:40:38,174
Okay. Um...

916
00:40:38,259 --> 00:40:39,505
<i>Uh...</i>

917
00:40:39,589 --> 00:40:41,667
<i>Circle!
I-I need the circle!</i>

918
00:40:41,752 --> 00:40:42,878
No.

919
00:40:43,133 --> 00:40:45,289
Here we go. Where...

920
00:40:45,459 --> 00:40:46,755
Okay, I'm...

921
00:40:46,839 --> 00:40:48,635
I need a... circle.

922
00:40:48,719 --> 00:40:49,935
Ah.

923
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:52,986
So, um, if we divide
a circle into fourths

924
00:40:53,125 --> 00:40:55,951
and then we remove
one of those fourths...

925
00:40:56,129 --> 00:40:57,583
We have to get him
down from there.

926
00:40:57,668 --> 00:40:59,084
I'll call for
a gurney and oxygen.

927
00:40:59,169 --> 00:41:01,375
...now a third of...
Of the remainder.

928
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:03,086
Um... you see?

929
00:41:03,245 --> 00:41:06,520
Okay, a-and then
all of the pieces will continue

930
00:41:06,652 --> 00:41:08,398
to make... make the whole,

931
00:41:08,483 --> 00:41:11,270
eh, if the whole
is filled with...

932
00:41:11,355 --> 00:41:12,645
With, uh, evidence.

933
00:41:12,730 --> 00:41:14,849
<i>Now, this evidence that
we're talking about is...</i>

934
00:41:14,934 --> 00:41:15,930
Richard,
Richard, Richard.

935
00:41:16,127 --> 00:41:17,463
Richard. Okay?

936
00:41:17,625 --> 00:41:19,226
We're gonna take you home.
You're not feeling well.

937
00:41:19,339 --> 00:41:20,875
Uh, you know what?
I'm... I'm fine.

938
00:41:20,959 --> 00:41:22,335
You're... You're...
You're embarrassing me.

939
00:41:22,419 --> 00:41:24,312
<i>I'm... I'm sorry,
ladies and gentlemen.</i>

940
00:41:24,397 --> 00:41:26,273
But the historic
illusion of, uh...

941
00:41:26,358 --> 00:41:27,586
Please, Richard.

942
00:41:29,589 --> 00:41:30,875
W-Who are you?

943
00:41:30,959 --> 00:41:32,929
It's me.
It's... It's Maggie.

944
00:41:34,473 --> 00:41:36,229
Um...
Um, oh... oh... but...

945
00:41:36,314 --> 00:41:37,695
Oh, yes. Yes.

946
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:39,234
- The... The historical illusion that...
- Okay.

947
00:41:39,319 --> 00:41:40,255
Dr. Webber.

948
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:41,375
<i>Get your hands off of me!</i>

949
00:41:41,459 --> 00:41:42,344
Oh!

950
00:41:42,429 --> 00:41:44,062
- <i>Uh, if... if...</i>
- Somebody please call 911!

951
00:41:44,211 --> 00:41:45,134
I think he's
having a stroke.

952
00:41:45,219 --> 00:41:46,755
And can somebody turn on
the lights?

953
00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:48,255
I have to finish my...
My presentation.

954
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:50,143
<i>- I-I gotta finish this.</i>
- Oh, my God.

What's happening?

959
00:42:02,049 --> 00:42:03,445
I don't know.

960
00:42:04,679 --> 00:42:06,704
<i>I'm not sure I really
believe you're here.</i>

961
00:42:06,789 --> 00:42:07,755
