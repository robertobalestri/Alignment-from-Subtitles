10
00:00:19,612 --> 00:00:20,981

the part where
your husband leaves you,

00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:47,336
you cry every time
you see his toothbrush,

24
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:49,519
so you're living on
your best friend's couch.

25
00:00:49,604 --> 00:00:51,683
Well, stay as
long as you want.

26
00:00:51,768 --> 00:00:55,066
It's been perfect, hanging out
and watching bad movies,

27
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:57,597
trying every dinner special
at Kung Pao's.

28
00:00:57,810 --> 00:00:59,129
It's been nice
to think about anything

29
00:00:59,213 --> 00:01:00,339
other than Amelia.

30
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:02,388

31
00:01:02,472 --> 00:01:03,536

32
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:04,824
Yeah, I heard
that, too.

33
00:01:04,909 --> 00:01:07,277
Stand up too fast,
and blood rushes downward,

34
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:09,410
away from the brain.

35
00:01:09,673 --> 00:01:11,929
It causes dizziness
or even fainting.

36
00:01:12,014 --> 00:01:16,660
So, he moved there, and he's not
coming back to say goodbye?

37
00:01:16,745 --> 00:01:17,980

to talk about it.

Other than that, she doesn't
want to talk about it.

41
00:01:23,237 --> 00:01:25,120
Oof. This is massive.

42
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:26,836

58
00:01:53,545 --> 00:01:56,421
Well, my mom e-mailed
some venue suggestions... 13.

59
00:01:56,506 --> 00:01:58,622
Planning this wedding
is gonna be a part-time job.

60
00:01:58,706 --> 00:01:59,882
Or a full-time job.

61
00:01:59,966 --> 00:02:01,252
That's why they call it
a wedding planner.

62
00:02:01,336 --> 00:02:02,922
We could hire one.

63
00:02:03,006 --> 00:02:05,036
'Cause you don't want
to plan the wedding?

64
00:02:05,121 --> 00:02:07,012
No, of course...
of course I do.

65
00:02:07,097 --> 00:02:08,051
I'm just a little anxious

66
00:02:08,136 --> 00:02:09,252
to check in
on one of my patients,

67
00:02:09,336 --> 00:02:11,051
and this elevator just
doesn't seem to want to...

68
00:02:11,135 --> 00:02:12,792
Oh.

69
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:20,672
You coming or...?

70
00:02:20,756 --> 00:02:22,256
Yep.

71
00:02:27,626 --> 00:02:29,922
Dr. Hunt. Dr. Altman.

72
00:02:30,006 --> 00:02:33,382
Kiddos.
You're looking like... kids.

73
00:02:33,466 --> 00:02:34,560
We...

74
00:02:34,644 --> 00:02:36,497
There's a VIP guest today,
uh, Hunt.

75
00:02:36,582 --> 00:02:38,129
Uh, Griffin Ford.
Tech billionaire...

76
00:02:38,214 --> 00:02:39,792
blew up a rocket
over a gas station.

77
00:02:39,876 --> 00:02:41,254
Oh, yeah, thanks
for the heads up.

78
00:02:41,339 --> 00:02:43,332
Oh, oh, you betcha.

79
00:02:43,416 --> 00:02:44,582
Will you be visiting
the cardio floor?

80
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:46,382
Depends on how bored
he is.

81
00:02:48,006 --> 00:02:49,832
Oh, mm, two more
wedding venues from my mom.

82
00:02:49,916 --> 00:02:51,542
I'll forward them
to you.

83
00:02:51,626 --> 00:02:53,582
Maybe it'll help you figure out
what it is you want.

84
00:02:53,666 --> 00:02:54,832
Great. Thanks.

85
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:56,082
It's important
to know what you want.

86
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:58,542
It's...

87
00:02:58,626 --> 00:02:59,672
Let me know
what you think, okay?

88
00:02:59,756 --> 00:03:01,292
Okay, yeah.
Love you. Okay.

89
00:03:01,376 --> 00:03:02,423
- You got the kids?
- Yeah.

90
00:03:02,508 --> 00:03:03,502
Okay. Oh! Sorry.

91
00:03:03,586 --> 00:03:04,712
Oh! Hello.

92
00:03:04,796 --> 00:03:05,720
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

93
00:03:05,805 --> 00:03:07,082
Okay.

94
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:08,586
Okay.

95
00:03:10,256 --> 00:03:11,502
Hey, do you have
a minute to discuss

96
00:03:11,586 --> 00:03:13,042
Mr. Paxton's pacemaker?

97
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:14,292
I do.

98
00:03:14,376 --> 00:03:15,422
Uh, do you want to go
get his chart?

99
00:03:15,506 --> 00:03:16,622
Um, sure.

100
00:03:16,706 --> 00:03:17,882
- Great.
- Mm-hmm.

101
00:03:19,376 --> 00:03:20,582
You're acting weird.

102
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:21,542
I'm being nice.

103
00:03:21,626 --> 00:03:23,292
Which for you,
with Owen, is weird.

104
00:03:23,376 --> 00:03:25,002
My pillow still smells
like your hair.

105
00:03:25,086 --> 00:03:26,672
I'm supposed to be mean
to the guy, too?

106
00:03:26,756 --> 00:03:27,922
Well, he's gonna
know something is up.

107
00:03:28,006 --> 00:03:29,382
Something is up.

108
00:03:29,466 --> 00:03:30,962
I mean, as much as
I... as I enjoyed

109
00:03:31,046 --> 00:03:33,422
the... the up-ness of it
and hope it continues,

110
00:03:33,506 --> 00:03:35,461
I think we should take a minute
to discuss what it means.

111
00:03:35,545 --> 00:03:36,844
It doesn't mean anything.

112
00:03:36,928 --> 00:03:39,694
I'm sorry, but I acted
impulsively because

113
00:03:39,779 --> 00:03:42,694
I'm afraid of... something,
which might not even be true.

114
00:03:42,779 --> 00:03:44,570
That wasn't much
of an apology.

115
00:03:44,655 --> 00:03:46,611
Tom, you're a good man.

116
00:03:46,695 --> 00:03:48,321
I try to be, but you
haven't been helping.

117
00:03:50,405 --> 00:03:51,901
Hi.

118
00:03:51,985 --> 00:03:53,401
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

119
00:03:53,485 --> 00:03:56,731
Uh, so, Mr. Paxton...
his, uh, last X-ray showed a...

120
00:03:56,815 --> 00:03:58,401
Something is happening.

121
00:03:58,485 --> 00:04:00,361
Well, he did have
an arrhythmia.

122
00:04:00,445 --> 00:04:03,941
Yeah, I'm not talking
about Mr. Paxton.

123
00:04:04,025 --> 00:04:05,571
You asked me
if you were crazy.

124
00:04:05,655 --> 00:04:07,361
I said you weren't.
Then I share an elevator ride

125
00:04:07,445 --> 00:04:09,111
with you, and I feel
the need to take a shower.

126
00:04:09,195 --> 00:04:10,731
Okay, fine.
I slept with Tom.

127
00:04:10,815 --> 00:04:12,821
What?!
No, no, no, no, no!

128
00:04:12,905 --> 00:04:14,111
Don't tell me that!

129
00:04:14,195 --> 00:04:15,071
I thought you were
saying that...

130
00:04:15,155 --> 00:04:16,111
I was speculating!

131
00:04:16,195 --> 00:04:17,321
God, talk about
a telltale heart.

132
00:04:17,405 --> 00:04:19,111
I know! I know!
I feel awful.

133
00:04:19,195 --> 00:04:20,821
I- I panicked,
and he was there,

134
00:04:20,905 --> 00:04:22,651
or I went there...

135
00:04:22,735 --> 00:04:24,405
Oh, God, I want to die!

136
00:04:26,315 --> 00:04:27,651
Okay, Mr. Paxton?

137
00:04:27,735 --> 00:04:28,611
I'll cover it.

138
00:04:28,695 --> 00:04:30,941
Great. Thank you.

139
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:33,441
Oh, no, no, no.

140
00:04:33,525 --> 00:04:34,981
I got it. I got it.
I got this.

141
00:04:35,065 --> 00:04:36,821
That is a donation from

142
00:04:36,905 --> 00:04:39,365
the Victoria Hughes
apology fund.

143
00:04:40,865 --> 00:04:42,071
I was gonna
bake you something.

144
00:04:42,155 --> 00:04:43,651
But...

145
00:04:43,735 --> 00:04:45,071
"Sorry I sorta kinda

146
00:04:45,155 --> 00:04:46,321
moved into your place
without telling you,"

147
00:04:46,405 --> 00:04:47,521
doesn't really fit on
a cupcake,

148
00:04:47,605 --> 00:04:50,651
and I wasn't sure
you wanted to see me.

149
00:04:50,735 --> 00:04:53,111
I just wanted communication.
That's it.

150
00:04:53,195 --> 00:04:54,521
If you need to crash
at my place

151
00:04:54,605 --> 00:04:55,781
'cause you're
looking for an apartment,

152
00:04:55,865 --> 00:04:56,821
of course you can.

153
00:04:56,905 --> 00:04:58,651
Just maybe ask first.

154
00:04:58,735 --> 00:05:00,691
Yeah. Yeah, well, thanks
for the offer.

155
00:05:00,775 --> 00:05:03,571
But I already
found the perfect spot, so...

156
00:05:03,655 --> 00:05:04,691
Well, good. Yeah.

157
00:05:04,775 --> 00:05:05,941
That's good news.
What part of town?

158
00:05:06,025 --> 00:05:07,945
Lake Union.
Dean's place.

159
00:05:09,525 --> 00:05:10,873
Dean? Really?

160
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:13,818
Okay, so, he's moved out
of that houseboat?

161
00:05:13,903 --> 00:05:16,191
No, no, no.
We're boatmates, I guess.

162
00:05:16,275 --> 00:05:17,781
Or, he just had a kid
so technically,

163
00:05:17,865 --> 00:05:20,021
I have two boatmates.

164
00:05:20,105 --> 00:05:23,571
But it's great news,
right?

165
00:05:23,655 --> 00:05:26,191
It's, uh... It's news.

166
00:05:26,275 --> 00:05:29,201
That is certainly news.

167
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,443
Um, well, I'm gonna
go see Rigo

168
00:05:33,565 --> 00:05:35,912
and give his wife
some coffee.

169
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:37,831
- Okay.
- Alright.

170
00:05:39,815 --> 00:05:42,021
It's really good news,
Jackson.

171
00:05:42,105 --> 00:05:44,155
It's all good.
No worries.

172
00:05:46,015 --> 00:05:48,391
Who... Who sent you?
Look, I-I want a name.

173
00:05:48,476 --> 00:05:49,642
Was it Catherine?

174
00:05:49,777 --> 00:05:51,225
You know, I want to see
that invoice there.

175
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:52,084
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa! - What?

176
00:05:52,169 --> 00:05:53,221
What? Uh, uh,

177
00:05:53,306 --> 00:05:55,932
let's just... I'm sorry.
I'm Chief Bailey.

178
00:05:56,085 --> 00:05:56,940
Can I help you?

179
00:05:57,025 --> 00:05:58,123
He's the one
who needs help.

180
00:05:58,208 --> 00:06:00,670
Someone sent back my office
furniture from Pac-North,

181
00:06:00,755 --> 00:06:03,001
and I told these guys
that I didn't send for it,

182
00:06:03,086 --> 00:06:05,672
I don't want it,
and they can take it back!

183
00:06:05,905 --> 00:06:07,068
- Whoa, wait, wait!
- Hey.

184
00:06:07,153 --> 00:06:08,529
A- All of it?

185
00:06:08,614 --> 00:06:10,026
Are you planning on
sitting on the floor?

186
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:11,856
You know what?
I don't have time for this.

187
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:13,529
I have a skills lab
to teach.

188
00:06:13,622 --> 00:06:15,031
<i> Dr. Rager to Peds.</i>

189
00:06:15,115 --> 00:06:16,193
<i>Dr. Sara Rager to Peds.</i>

190
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:18,451
So, we're
taking it all back?

191
00:06:20,945 --> 00:06:22,209
Noelle Webb, 43,

192
00:06:22,294 --> 00:06:23,980
complains of abdominal pain
and dizziness

193
00:06:24,065 --> 00:06:25,361
after falling off
a ladder.

194
00:06:25,445 --> 00:06:27,571
- Hi, Noelle. I'm Dr. Grey.
- Hi.

195
00:06:27,655 --> 00:06:28,857
Did you just
lose your balance?

196
00:06:28,942 --> 00:06:30,132
Do you have
any other symptoms?

197
00:06:30,216 --> 00:06:34,002
I- I was painting this house,
and I just got woozy for a sec.

198
00:06:34,329 --> 00:06:36,205
Fumes got to me.

199
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:38,416
I need my phone.
I think it's still at the site.

200
00:06:38,501 --> 00:06:39,279
Okay.

201
00:06:39,364 --> 00:06:41,490
Noelle, we'll get
your phone for you.

202
00:06:41,575 --> 00:06:42,763
Ohh.

203
00:06:42,848 --> 00:06:44,093
Do you have any other
health issues

204
00:06:44,177 --> 00:06:45,723
that I need to know about?

205
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:49,360
Oh, I-I'm a type-1 diabetic,
but I take care of it.

206
00:06:49,445 --> 00:06:51,281
You know, I-I-I'm good
about what I eat.

207
00:06:51,365 --> 00:06:52,881
- Oh! Oh!
- When's the last time

208
00:06:52,966 --> 00:06:54,172
you checked
your blood sugar?

209
00:06:54,257 --> 00:06:56,279
Recently... ish.

210
00:06:56,364 --> 00:06:58,650
Ohh,
my Giggle Days rating

211
00:06:58,735 --> 00:07:00,365
is gonna go
in the toilet from this.

212
00:07:00,465 --> 00:07:01,607
- Ooh!
- What's Giggle Days?

213
00:07:01,692 --> 00:07:03,318
It's an app
for small jobs.

214
00:07:03,657 --> 00:07:05,953
Gig economy.
They think they're cute.

215
00:07:06,053 --> 00:07:07,943
Connects you to people
who need help

216
00:07:08,028 --> 00:07:10,824
or their Internet hooked up
or their couch moved,

217
00:07:10,909 --> 00:07:13,365
or, in my case,
a house painted.

218
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:16,178
But it's so un-cute
if my rating goes down.

219
00:07:16,263 --> 00:07:17,799
I see some
free fluid there.

220
00:07:17,884 --> 00:07:19,724
What's that?
Is that bad?

221
00:07:19,809 --> 00:07:22,395
Well, we just need to run
some more tests to make sure.

222
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,029
Dr. Schmitt, let's admit
her for observation.

223
00:07:25,114 --> 00:07:27,568
Get a full set of labs
and order a CT trauma series.

224
00:07:27,653 --> 00:07:28,662
And my phone!

225
00:07:28,747 --> 00:07:30,987
We will ask the paramedics
if they have found your phone.

226
00:07:31,206 --> 00:07:32,576
I'll see you
soon, Noelle.

227
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:34,282
<i>Dr. Daniel to Pediatrics.</i>

228
00:07:36,116 --> 00:07:37,702
Heads up.
She may seem nice,

229
00:07:37,786 --> 00:07:39,532
but she just wants
a condo on Mars.

230
00:07:39,616 --> 00:07:41,162
Oh, no. No, no,
I'll take the kindness,

231
00:07:41,246 --> 00:07:42,992
even if it's insincere.

232
00:07:43,076 --> 00:07:45,123
Most of the people in this
city think I'm a monster.

233
00:07:45,286 --> 00:07:47,492
Well, big company,
big accident,

234
00:07:47,576 --> 00:07:48,748
classic clickbait.

235
00:07:48,857 --> 00:07:51,322
The firefighter, Rigo Vasquez,
is here recovering.

236
00:07:51,406 --> 00:07:52,742
I know he's eager
to thank you for covering his,

237
00:07:52,826 --> 00:07:53,862
uh, medical expenses.

238
00:07:53,946 --> 00:07:55,662
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
Listen, before we, uh...

239
00:07:55,746 --> 00:07:57,622
before we get to that...

240
00:08:01,206 --> 00:08:03,322
This thing is,
uh, catastrophic.

241
00:08:03,406 --> 00:08:05,532
My investors are spooked.

242
00:08:05,616 --> 00:08:07,771
"Woke" Twitter is
eating me alive.

243
00:08:07,856 --> 00:08:09,122
Well, th... there were
no fatalities.

244
00:08:09,206 --> 00:08:11,452
"Billionaire explodes
rocket over Seattle"

245
00:08:11,536 --> 00:08:13,742
is the only thing
anyone cares about.

246
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:16,452
And now there are rumors
of a criminal investigation.

247
00:08:16,536 --> 00:08:19,702
People got hurt on my watch,
by my hand.

248
00:08:19,786 --> 00:08:21,912
I made mistakes, Tom.

249
00:08:21,996 --> 00:08:25,322
Mistakes that
are... beneath me.

250
00:08:25,406 --> 00:08:27,572
Now, I may fail sometimes.

251
00:08:27,656 --> 00:08:30,532
I was a crap husband,
and I suck at golf.

252
00:08:30,616 --> 00:08:32,952
But my critical thinking,

253
00:08:33,036 --> 00:08:35,572
my calculations,
my understanding of physics...

254
00:08:35,656 --> 00:08:37,322
that's never failed me.

255
00:08:37,406 --> 00:08:39,782
Now, I don't know
if it's a brain tumor,

256
00:08:39,866 --> 00:08:43,702
some neurological disease,
if it's cancer,

257
00:08:43,786 --> 00:08:49,622
but I need you to find
whatever it is and fix it

258
00:08:49,706 --> 00:08:53,206
before this nightmare wipes out
all the good I've done.

259
00:08:54,496 --> 00:08:56,992
Well, you've come
to the right place.

260
00:08:57,076 --> 00:08:59,532
Why don't you text her,
see if she wants to talk?

261
00:08:59,616 --> 00:09:00,742
About what?

262
00:09:00,826 --> 00:09:02,032
The baby that might
be Owen's

263
00:09:02,116 --> 00:09:03,615
or the relationship
she just ended?

264
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,406
Or the weather?
I'll pass.

265
00:09:05,491 --> 00:09:07,447
If she wants to talk to me,
she can find me.

266
00:09:07,656 --> 00:09:08,912
I'm done chasing her.

267
00:09:08,996 --> 00:09:10,242
Okay.

268
00:09:13,076 --> 00:09:14,702
Brad Spencer, 22.

269
00:09:14,786 --> 00:09:17,072
Found unresponsive with burns
on three extremities.

270
00:09:17,156 --> 00:09:18,662
GCS of 6T.

271
00:09:18,746 --> 00:09:21,412
We got him back after
multiple rounds of CPR.

272
00:09:21,496 --> 00:09:23,202
He jumped onto a train track
and got electrocuted.

273
00:09:23,286 --> 00:09:25,572
He didn't jump. He fell.
We were kissing.

274
00:09:25,656 --> 00:09:27,322
We were saying goodbye,
and we thought that

275
00:09:27,406 --> 00:09:29,122
the train
was still behind us.

276
00:09:29,206 --> 00:09:31,362
Then he turned around
too fast, and he just fell.

277
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:32,702
Oh, my God! Link!

278
00:09:32,786 --> 00:09:34,452
It's the face-eaters
from this morning!

279
00:09:34,536 --> 00:09:35,662
Alright, okay,
we got to go!

280
00:09:35,746 --> 00:09:37,532
Trauma one!
Go, go, go!

281
00:09:43,531 --> 00:09:45,531
<font color=#FF00FF>*GREY'S ANATOMY*</font>

Episode Title: <font color=#FFc30f>"Life on Mars?"</font>
Aired on: <font color="#00ffff">March 12, 2020</font>

283
00:09:54,162 --> 00:09:55,513
Third-degree burns
on this arm.

284
00:09:55,598 --> 00:09:57,475
- Head trauma?
- I paged Koracick.

285
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,382
And he's busy.
What happened?

286
00:09:59,467 --> 00:10:01,793
Brad fell on his guitar,
which fell on the train tracks.

287
00:10:01,877 --> 00:10:03,053
He was making out
with his girlfriend.

288
00:10:03,137 --> 00:10:04,423
I don't have a pulse
in either wrist,

289
00:10:04,507 --> 00:10:05,883
and this arm is cold
and tight.

290
00:10:05,967 --> 00:10:07,633
- This one, too.
- Okay, right leg's okay,

291
00:10:07,717 --> 00:10:09,713
but I'm not getting
anything in the left foot.

292
00:10:09,797 --> 00:10:10,883
- Compartment syndrome.
- Compartment syndrome, okay.

293
00:10:10,967 --> 00:10:12,923
- Okay.
- Scalpels and sterile gloves!

294
00:10:13,007 --> 00:10:14,045
Simms, you ever done
a fasciotomy?

295
00:10:14,129 --> 00:10:15,415
Does a cadaver count?

296
00:10:15,499 --> 00:10:17,165
You and Jo take the arms.
I'll take the leg.

297
00:10:19,089 --> 00:10:20,915
Pupils are equal
and reactive,

298
00:10:20,999 --> 00:10:22,215
but I can't rule out
a head injury.

299
00:10:22,299 --> 00:10:23,505
He needs a CT ASAP.

300
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:25,085
After we
save his limbs.

301
00:10:25,169 --> 00:10:26,755
Okay, fasciotomies
on my count.

302
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:28,255
One, two...

303
00:10:28,339 --> 00:10:29,755
Wait, wait! Is that her?

304
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:31,375
She should
not see this.

305
00:10:34,249 --> 00:10:37,165
Alright,
one, two, three.

306
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:47,545
Do you care if I stand?

307
00:10:47,629 --> 00:10:49,835
Stand, sit,
whatever you need.

308
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:51,585
I don't need to stand.

309
00:10:51,669 --> 00:10:54,045
I just p-prefer to,
I guess.

310
00:10:54,129 --> 00:10:55,415
Okay, whatever's
more comfortable.

311
00:10:57,589 --> 00:10:58,835
You don't think
that's possible?

312
00:10:58,919 --> 00:11:00,585
To be comfortable here?

313
00:11:00,669 --> 00:11:03,255
I think that
when your bosses tell you

314
00:11:03,339 --> 00:11:05,505
that you can't operate
until a counselor signs off,

315
00:11:05,589 --> 00:11:07,505
it sort of casts a mood.

316
00:11:07,589 --> 00:11:09,375
Okay, what kind of mood?

317
00:11:13,299 --> 00:11:17,064
Look, our patients were
at extreme risk, alright?

318
00:11:17,149 --> 00:11:18,165
And I keep coming back
to the fact that

319
00:11:18,249 --> 00:11:20,215
if I'd behaved differently,
they'd be dead.

320
00:11:20,299 --> 00:11:21,835
Mm-hmm.
And that's all it was...

321
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:22,966
just passion for the work.

322
00:11:23,051 --> 00:11:24,215
Trying to save lives.

323
00:11:24,299 --> 00:11:26,428
It's not some manic,
uh, whatever.

324
00:11:26,513 --> 00:11:27,641
I didn't say "manic."

325
00:11:27,726 --> 00:11:29,373
Are you experiencing
symptoms of mania?

326
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:30,529
No.

327
00:11:30,614 --> 00:11:32,375
Agitation,
inflated confidence,

328
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:35,045
rambling,
increased sex drive?

329
00:11:35,129 --> 00:11:37,455
N- No.
No, none of that.

330
00:11:37,539 --> 00:11:41,715
I just... I've... had
a very stressful couple weeks.

331
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:43,335
That's all.

332
00:11:43,419 --> 00:11:45,749
Okay.

333
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:50,331
"Painter left job unfinished,
spilled paint on porch.

334
00:11:50,839 --> 00:11:52,715
Do not hire this person.

335
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:56,125
Shrug emoji, poop emoji,
thumbs-down emoji.

336
00:11:56,209 --> 00:11:57,335
Zero stars."

337
00:11:57,419 --> 00:11:58,625
I'm sure you can have
that removed

338
00:11:58,709 --> 00:12:00,375
if you contact
customer service.

339
00:12:00,459 --> 00:12:02,955
You sound like someone
who's never tried to do that.

340
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:05,085
Schmitt, she should've
had a CT by now.

341
00:12:05,169 --> 00:12:06,295
And what's the status
on her room?

342
00:12:06,379 --> 00:12:07,665
Apparently there's an issue
with admissions.

343
00:12:07,749 --> 00:12:08,955
A lot of people
got moved around.

344
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:10,335
Some VIP thing.

345
00:12:10,419 --> 00:12:11,955
Do I get some kind of
discount for the wait?

346
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:14,085
I do have
her lab results, though.

347
00:12:14,169 --> 00:12:15,335
Oh.

348
00:12:17,222 --> 00:12:19,754
Whoa. Noelle, these
numbers are kinda high.

349
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,915
Are you taking your
insulin regularly?

350
00:12:21,999 --> 00:12:23,085
I'm pretty good
about it.

351
00:12:23,169 --> 00:12:26,215
"Pretty good"...
what does that mean?

352
00:12:26,299 --> 00:12:27,375
We're not gonna judge you.

353
00:12:27,459 --> 00:12:29,255
I just need to know so these
numbers make sense.

354
00:12:29,339 --> 00:12:31,005
Are you taking
your insulin?

355
00:12:31,089 --> 00:12:33,625
Okay, the deal is

356
00:12:33,709 --> 00:12:35,835
I just moved my folks
into assisted living,

357
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:37,665
and that's not cheap.

358
00:12:37,749 --> 00:12:41,215
I've been working all these apps
trying to make ends meet.

359
00:12:41,299 --> 00:12:44,085
But there isn't always
enough left over for me.

360
00:12:44,169 --> 00:12:48,215
So, um, I've been
rationing my insulin

361
00:12:48,299 --> 00:12:50,585
until my situation's
more stable.

362
00:12:50,669 --> 00:12:52,505
Unfortunately, that's
not how this works.

363
00:12:52,589 --> 00:12:54,215
I'm... I'm sure that's why
you got dizzy and fell.

364
00:12:55,339 --> 00:12:56,755
Dr. Grey,
Chief Koracick needs you.

365
00:12:56,839 --> 00:12:58,125
Well, tell him to wait.

366
00:12:58,209 --> 00:12:59,731
He says
it's an emergency.

367
00:12:59,817 --> 00:13:03,574
Okay, let's get her a CT,
check on the status of her room,

368
00:13:03,659 --> 00:13:05,535
page me as soon
as she gets in.

369
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:07,121
- Okay.
- Okay?

370
00:13:08,614 --> 00:13:10,875
Dr. Grey.
Thank you for coming.

371
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:12,455
Why's this floor empty?

372
00:13:12,539 --> 00:13:13,739
You said this was
an emergency.

373
00:13:13,824 --> 00:13:15,370
Oh, it is.
Emergent, uh, consult.

374
00:13:15,455 --> 00:13:17,581
Griffin Ford
is here today.

375
00:13:17,667 --> 00:13:19,035
The billionaire
rocket guy?

376
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,120
Yeah, maybe don't
call him that.

377
00:13:22,722 --> 00:13:24,106
Wait a second.
Please don't tell me

378
00:13:24,191 --> 00:13:25,762
you let him buy out
this entire floor.

379
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:27,064
No, of course not.
He got it for free.

380
00:13:27,148 --> 00:13:29,481
He's a great friend to
the Catherine Fox Foundation.

381
00:13:29,997 --> 00:13:31,873
The emergency room is
overflowing!

382
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:33,927
Patients need rooms.
My patient needs a room.

383
00:13:34,012 --> 00:13:35,835
Well, all... all the more reason
to get this taken care of

384
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:37,115
and get him on his...
on his way.

385
00:13:37,199 --> 00:13:39,045
Th-This guy is about
a lot more than,

386
00:13:39,129 --> 00:13:40,415
uh, spaceships, Grey.

387
00:13:40,499 --> 00:13:43,295
He's working to fight
climate change, uh, end poverty.

388
00:13:43,379 --> 00:13:46,125
And... And I'm pretty sure,
uh, he's... he's single.

389
00:13:46,209 --> 00:13:47,415
Okay, not interested.

390
00:13:47,499 --> 00:13:50,625
Okay, you don't have to be
nice, but be a pro.

391
00:13:57,459 --> 00:14:01,415
Yes.
Yes. Good girl, Emmie.

392
00:14:04,379 --> 00:14:05,915
<i>Dr. Mochrie to OR 3.</i>

393
00:14:05,999 --> 00:14:07,375
Hey.

394
00:14:07,459 --> 00:14:09,039
Dr. Julia Mochrie to OR 3.

395
00:14:12,088 --> 00:14:14,668
Teddy, what...
what was that?

396
00:14:14,776 --> 00:14:15,982
Oh, I...
Well, I just, uh...

397
00:14:16,067 --> 00:14:17,733
I just wanted to
take the stairs.

398
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:20,125
Teddy, what's wrong?

399
00:14:20,209 --> 00:14:22,625
I know you too well.
Something has happened.

400
00:14:22,709 --> 00:14:24,539
Just tell me.

401
00:14:32,386 --> 00:14:34,346
Amelia's baby
might be yours.

402
00:14:35,276 --> 00:14:36,276
I mean

403
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:39,505
Might be,
as in might not.

404
00:14:39,589 --> 00:14:40,585
I just...

405
00:14:40,669 --> 00:14:44,295
I don't... I don't
think she knows yet.

406
00:14:44,379 --> 00:14:45,715
Jo.

407
00:14:45,799 --> 00:14:46,955
What does Jo have to do
with anything?

408
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,625
She mentioned
something in surgery.

409
00:14:48,709 --> 00:14:50,625
She said, "What would
you do if..."

410
00:14:50,709 --> 00:14:52,335
How do you even know this?
Did Amelia tell you or...

411
00:14:52,419 --> 00:14:53,505
- No.
- Then who?

412
00:14:53,589 --> 00:14:54,835
It doesn't matter.
Te... You just told me

413
00:14:54,919 --> 00:14:56,915
that I-I might have another
baby with another woman.

414
00:14:56,999 --> 00:14:58,168
Amelia, your ex-wife.

415
00:14:58,253 --> 00:14:59,435
I need to make sure
that you didn't hear

416
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:00,455
some rumor
and run with it.

417
00:15:00,539 --> 00:15:01,309
Run with it?

418
00:15:01,394 --> 00:15:02,285
I want to make sure
that it's real.

419
00:15:02,387 --> 00:15:03,624
It's real, Owen!

420
00:15:03,709 --> 00:15:05,020
It's a real baby,

421
00:15:05,105 --> 00:15:07,145
and you might
really be the father!

422
00:15:12,317 --> 00:15:14,067
If you have a baby
with Amelia,

423
00:15:14,169 --> 00:15:16,209
what does that mean
for us?

424
00:15:17,157 --> 00:15:18,857
I...

425
00:15:19,709 --> 00:15:21,059
Wow.

426
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:23,636
Wow.

427
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:25,059
Wow.

428
00:15:25,539 --> 00:15:26,919
Teddy.

429
00:15:35,411 --> 00:15:37,497
I enjoyed your article.

430
00:15:37,582 --> 00:15:38,998
Which one?

431
00:15:39,082 --> 00:15:40,658
Uh, "The List."

432
00:15:40,742 --> 00:15:43,748
Exposing all those problems
with the healthcare system.

433
00:15:43,832 --> 00:15:45,868
I bet that ruffled
some feathers around here.

434
00:15:45,952 --> 00:15:47,408
We survived.

435
00:15:47,492 --> 00:15:50,788
Reasonable people adapt
themselves to the world...

436
00:15:50,872 --> 00:15:52,998
unreasonable people persist

437
00:15:53,082 --> 00:15:55,368
in adapting the world
to themselves.

438
00:15:55,452 --> 00:15:59,288
Therefore, all progress depends
on unreasonable people.

439
00:15:59,372 --> 00:16:01,578
- Huh. Profound.
- Hmm.

440
00:16:01,662 --> 00:16:03,618
The future should ruffle
feathers. Don't you think?

441
00:16:03,702 --> 00:16:06,286
Sometimes your vision demands
that you light the spark,

442
00:16:06,371 --> 00:16:09,198
you... storm the palace.

443
00:16:09,282 --> 00:16:11,248
- I've been there.
- Hmm.

444
00:16:11,332 --> 00:16:13,698
You don't agree?

445
00:16:13,782 --> 00:16:15,618
I just find it ironic
that someone who has

446
00:16:15,702 --> 00:16:17,748
a whole hospital floor
to themselves

447
00:16:17,832 --> 00:16:19,788
is talking about
storming palaces.

448
00:16:19,872 --> 00:16:21,698
I didn't ask for
an entire floor.

449
00:16:21,782 --> 00:16:23,118
You didn't have to.

450
00:16:23,202 --> 00:16:24,328
You just asked
Catherine Fox for a favor,

451
00:16:24,412 --> 00:16:25,658
and, boom, here you are.

452
00:16:25,742 --> 00:16:27,958
Grey, time to
check his thyroid.

453
00:16:29,912 --> 00:16:31,458
Excuse me.

454
00:16:31,542 --> 00:16:32,748
Ooh! Look at that.

455
00:16:32,832 --> 00:16:34,198
My patient's in CT.

456
00:16:34,282 --> 00:16:35,788
Your patient's right here.

457
00:16:35,872 --> 00:16:37,038
He's someone else's
patient now.

458
00:16:37,122 --> 00:16:39,349
Mr. Ford,
may I introduce you to

459
00:16:39,434 --> 00:16:41,328
- Dr. Jackson Avery?
- Grey.

460
00:16:41,412 --> 00:16:43,458
We're rolling out
the red carpet for Mr. Ford,

461
00:16:43,542 --> 00:16:46,908
and it doesn't get any redder
than Dr. Avery.

462
00:16:46,992 --> 00:16:48,328
Wh... What's going on?

463
00:16:48,412 --> 00:16:50,832
Your mom, your mess.

464
00:16:54,122 --> 00:16:55,698
Brad's electrocution
injury

465
00:16:55,782 --> 00:16:57,328
affected the tissue
in his limbs.

466
00:16:57,412 --> 00:16:59,788
We had to cut through
both of his arms and his leg

467
00:16:59,872 --> 00:17:01,998
to preserve
the circulation.

468
00:17:02,082 --> 00:17:04,118
Still,
the damage was extensive.

469
00:17:04,202 --> 00:17:06,698
His head CT shows a small
epidural bleed in his brain,

470
00:17:06,782 --> 00:17:08,538
which I'll evacuate
in the OR.

471
00:17:08,622 --> 00:17:10,328
It could have been
a lot worse.

472
00:17:10,412 --> 00:17:11,458
We think that
the neck of his guitar

473
00:17:11,542 --> 00:17:12,658
took most of the impact.

474
00:17:12,742 --> 00:17:13,998
It probably
saved his life.

475
00:17:14,082 --> 00:17:16,538
Wow.

476
00:17:16,622 --> 00:17:18,288
One second, he was there,

477
00:17:18,372 --> 00:17:21,868
and then he just disappeared
like he fell through a trapdoor.

478
00:17:21,952 --> 00:17:24,498
You didn't hear
the train leaving?

479
00:17:24,582 --> 00:17:27,038
We... We just graduated
from U-Dub,

480
00:17:27,122 --> 00:17:31,118
and Brad got this internship
at a music studio here.

481
00:17:31,202 --> 00:17:35,198
But I won a Rhodes Scholarship,
and he's been so sweet,

482
00:17:35,282 --> 00:17:37,908
singing me these
corny love songs.

483
00:17:37,992 --> 00:17:40,078
But it's been torture
just knowing that

484
00:17:40,162 --> 00:17:41,578
we were gonna be apart.

485
00:17:41,662 --> 00:17:43,578
And I was on my way to
the airport today,

486
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:46,038
and he just got this look
on his face

487
00:17:46,122 --> 00:17:49,998
and... and he said, "Screw it.
Let's go to England together."

488
00:17:50,082 --> 00:17:52,198
And then he kissed me,
and it was like...

489
00:17:52,282 --> 00:17:53,912
everything was solved.

490
00:17:55,082 --> 00:17:58,538
Not even the "ding-ding"
of the doors closing?

491
00:17:58,622 --> 00:18:00,748
The annoying loudspeaker?

492
00:18:00,832 --> 00:18:03,578
Okay, uh, we are gonna
take Brad to the OR

493
00:18:03,662 --> 00:18:05,118
and then move him
to the ICU.

494
00:18:05,202 --> 00:18:06,868
We will let you know
if we have any updates.

495
00:18:06,952 --> 00:18:09,122
Okay.

496
00:18:12,372 --> 00:18:13,248
What are you doing here?

497
00:18:13,332 --> 00:18:14,328
I wasn't sure
if you could leave,

498
00:18:14,412 --> 00:18:15,828
so I paged everyone.

499
00:18:15,912 --> 00:18:18,118
There's a guy up there with
the entire floor to himself.

500
00:18:18,202 --> 00:18:20,408
Meanwhile, this woman
is rationing her insulin

501
00:18:20,492 --> 00:18:21,288
just to stay alive.

502
00:18:21,372 --> 00:18:22,288
It's infuriating.

503
00:18:23,742 --> 00:18:25,658
Oh. Scans are up.

504
00:18:25,742 --> 00:18:27,368
Big retroperitoneal
bleed.

505
00:18:27,452 --> 00:18:28,698
Kidney's shattered.
She needs an ex-lap.

506
00:18:28,782 --> 00:18:30,458
Let's book the OR.

507
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:32,328
And if any billionaire
tries to get in your way,

508
00:18:32,412 --> 00:18:34,452
push them aside.

509
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:37,998
Are you okay?

510
00:18:38,082 --> 00:18:39,698
Huh? Uh...

511
00:18:39,782 --> 00:18:41,118
Have you
talked to Amelia?

512
00:18:41,202 --> 00:18:42,078
About...?

513
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:43,458
Help! I need help!

514
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:47,458
BP's dropping.

515
00:18:47,542 --> 00:18:48,748
Abdomen's more distended.

516
00:18:48,832 --> 00:18:49,828
Let's get
an intubation tray.

517
00:18:49,912 --> 00:18:51,702
Book the OR.

518
00:18:54,082 --> 00:18:56,458
Hey, I got your page.
What's wrong?

519
00:18:56,542 --> 00:18:59,832
Let's talk
in your office.

520
00:19:05,912 --> 00:19:07,162
Ta-da!

521
00:19:08,202 --> 00:19:10,038
What the hell
did you do?

522
00:19:10,122 --> 00:19:12,788
What? I had the movers
bring up your old furniture

523
00:19:12,872 --> 00:19:15,158
from the basement and arrange
it like it was before.

524
00:19:15,242 --> 00:19:17,248
Look, I-I know

525
00:19:17,332 --> 00:19:18,868
you're still feeling down

526
00:19:18,952 --> 00:19:21,038
about Catherine
and everything else.

527
00:19:21,122 --> 00:19:23,952
So o-of course you didn't
want that Pac-North stuff.

528
00:19:25,582 --> 00:19:29,038
You think you know what
I want and what I don't want?

529
00:19:29,122 --> 00:19:30,498
I never wanted
this furniture moved in here

530
00:19:30,582 --> 00:19:31,958
in the first place!

531
00:19:32,042 --> 00:19:33,498
And it came anyway!

532
00:19:33,582 --> 00:19:35,158
And if I had wanted
this old junk back,

533
00:19:35,242 --> 00:19:36,458
I would have
asked for it!

534
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:38,828
Look, I want
an empty room!

535
00:19:38,912 --> 00:19:40,912
Why is that so hard
to understand?!

536
00:19:42,742 --> 00:19:44,368
You know,
you're just like her.

537
00:19:44,452 --> 00:19:46,288
You presume
to know what's best!

538
00:19:46,372 --> 00:19:47,998
Okay! Okay.

539
00:19:48,082 --> 00:19:49,958
It's an easy fix.
Ri... I d...

540
00:19:50,042 --> 00:19:52,748
I'll just call
building services and right...

541
00:19:52,832 --> 00:19:53,868
Ah.

542
00:19:53,952 --> 00:19:55,408
Okay, apparently,

543
00:19:55,492 --> 00:19:57,998
Tom Koracick has decided to
wreak havoc on the hospital.

544
00:19:58,082 --> 00:20:00,828
Look, I-I'll come back,
and I'll fix it.

545
00:20:00,912 --> 00:20:03,458
Don't bother!
I'll do it myself!

546
00:20:21,098 --> 00:20:23,254
Hey, I texted.
You didn't reply.

547
00:20:23,339 --> 00:20:26,514
Uh, yeah, I got stuck helping
babysit a billionaire.

548
00:20:26,598 --> 00:20:28,528
It screwed up
my entire schedule.

549
00:20:28,677 --> 00:20:30,183
You should go enjoy
your day off, though.

550
00:20:30,267 --> 00:20:32,285
You know, I can swing by
the boat later.

551
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:34,956
Maybe I can bring a housewarming
present for you and Dean.

552
00:20:35,183 --> 00:20:37,223
Jackson.
Jackson, hey.

553
00:20:38,394 --> 00:20:39,640
What's up?

554
00:20:39,731 --> 00:20:41,013
I move in, you're mad,
and I move out,

555
00:20:41,097 --> 00:20:42,473
and you're still mad.

556
00:20:42,557 --> 00:20:44,263
So, what... If you have
a problem, just tell me.

557
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:49,161
- Please.
- Okay.

558
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:55,552
Look, I know you
and Dean are friends.

559
00:20:55,637 --> 00:20:56,732
- Okay, I get that.
- Mm-hmm.

560
00:20:56,816 --> 00:20:58,233
I also think he has
a thing for you, so...

561
00:20:58,317 --> 00:20:59,484
What? No, he doesn't.
He doesn't have a...

562
00:20:59,568 --> 00:21:01,422
He also hit on Maggie
when we were together,

563
00:21:01,507 --> 00:21:03,035
so I kind of
question his whole...

564
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,826
Oh, you don't need
to question anything.

565
00:21:04,911 --> 00:21:06,183
He didn't know
she had a boyfriend,

566
00:21:06,267 --> 00:21:07,683
and when he did,
he backed off.

567
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:09,053
And then he invited you
to live with him.

568
00:21:09,137 --> 00:21:10,553
No, no, he did not...

569
00:21:10,637 --> 00:21:11,723
He did not invite me.
I asked.

570
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:13,129
Which somehow makes
it worse,

571
00:21:13,214 --> 00:21:13,981
- It...
- okay? Not...

572
00:21:14,066 --> 00:21:15,142
You live with him now.

573
00:21:15,227 --> 00:21:17,222
You're raising a baby
together, alright?

574
00:21:17,307 --> 00:21:18,278
You haven't
even met my child.

575
00:21:18,363 --> 00:21:19,700
You haven't invited me
to meet her.

576
00:21:19,784 --> 00:21:20,848
'Cause we're not
there yet!

577
00:21:20,933 --> 00:21:22,653
Then where are we?!
Because it sounds like

578
00:21:22,738 --> 00:21:24,192
we're in the place
where you freak out

579
00:21:24,276 --> 00:21:26,036
when I get too close
and when I live my life.

580
00:21:26,137 --> 00:21:27,184
So pick a lane.

581
00:21:27,284 --> 00:21:28,451
Look, I don't want to
fight with you.

582
00:21:28,535 --> 00:21:29,871
- Well, I do!
- I'm at work.

583
00:21:29,956 --> 00:21:31,382
I have a VIP patient
to deal with.

584
00:21:31,467 --> 00:21:32,599
So I'd like us...

585
00:21:32,683 --> 00:21:35,106
...to be able to talk about this
completely later.

586
00:21:35,217 --> 00:21:36,593
You know, I'm sorry.
If you can't answer

587
00:21:36,677 --> 00:21:38,183
the simple question
of where we are,

588
00:21:38,267 --> 00:21:39,451
I'm not sure we have
that much left

589
00:21:39,535 --> 00:21:40,841
- to talk about.
- Oh, you know what? Come on, okay?

590
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:42,817
You don't get to suddenly
dictate the timeline.

591
00:21:42,902 --> 00:21:45,592
You made choices that
I was not involved in.

592
00:21:45,677 --> 00:21:46,843
Give me a second
to process.

593
00:21:46,927 --> 00:21:49,053
Process what?
That I have friends?

594
00:21:49,137 --> 00:21:51,013
Okay, alright, yeah.
You have your process.

595
00:21:51,097 --> 00:21:53,183
Let me know
how it goes.

596
00:21:54,927 --> 00:21:56,843
We'll
need to page Avery post-op

597
00:21:56,927 --> 00:21:58,593
to take a look at these wounds
for closure later.

598
00:21:58,677 --> 00:22:00,053
Hematoma drained.

599
00:22:00,137 --> 00:22:01,423
He's lucky that guitar
didn't jam

600
00:22:01,507 --> 00:22:02,763
straight into his brain.

601
00:22:02,847 --> 00:22:04,051
It was a cheap guitar.

602
00:22:04,136 --> 00:22:05,962
So much
for dumb love songs.

603
00:22:06,062 --> 00:22:08,308
What is wrong
with making out in public

604
00:22:08,496 --> 00:22:11,158
and singing to each other
un-ironically, saying,

605
00:22:11,307 --> 00:22:12,683
"Screw it...
let's go have an adventure"?

606
00:22:12,767 --> 00:22:14,520
Isn't that what being 22
and in love is for?

607
00:22:14,605 --> 00:22:17,842
Yeah, until the part where
you get cooked on a train track.

608
00:22:17,927 --> 00:22:19,223
Word.

609
00:22:19,308 --> 00:22:20,934
Hmm. I'm done here.

610
00:22:21,019 --> 00:22:23,135
Do you two need help
dressing those wounds?

611
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:24,596
No, I think
we got it from here.

612
00:22:24,681 --> 00:22:26,303
Yeah, and we're good
to update the girlfriend

613
00:22:26,387 --> 00:22:28,473
if you have somewhere
you need to be.

614
00:22:33,467 --> 00:22:35,383
"Word"? Really?

615
00:22:35,467 --> 00:22:37,053
I know.

616
00:22:37,137 --> 00:22:38,215
I'll be right with
you guys, okay?

617
00:22:38,299 --> 00:22:40,895
Hey, Chief! Uh, I think
I got the overflow handled.

618
00:22:40,996 --> 00:22:41,785
So...

619
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:43,481
DeLuca, telling me
you're doing your job

620
00:22:43,566 --> 00:22:44,852
isn't a part of
doing your job.

621
00:22:44,937 --> 00:22:46,383
Right, but I just thought now
that that's taken care of,

622
00:22:46,467 --> 00:22:48,005
I could maybe start
treating some of the patients

623
00:22:48,089 --> 00:22:49,721
- that I've been moving?
- Oh, that isn't our deal.

624
00:22:49,805 --> 00:22:51,722
Look, I've been seeing
the counselor, alright?

625
00:22:51,807 --> 00:22:53,133
I did that.
And now with Dr. Webber

626
00:22:53,217 --> 00:22:55,883
handing off his entire service,
I just thought I could help.

627
00:22:55,967 --> 00:22:58,013
Webber handed off
his entire service?

628
00:22:58,097 --> 00:22:59,473
- Why?
- You know what?

629
00:22:59,557 --> 00:23:01,383
I don't really know because
gossip isn't a part of my job.

630
00:23:01,467 --> 00:23:03,343
I'm a surgeon.
Please, Chief, let me work.

631
00:23:03,427 --> 00:23:04,383
This... This...

632
00:23:04,467 --> 00:23:05,489
Chief?
Is that a yes?

633
00:23:05,574 --> 00:23:07,183
It is not.

634
00:23:11,464 --> 00:23:13,024
I can't find the bleeding.
She's in DIC.

635
00:23:13,129 --> 00:23:14,303
Can we control it
with a REBOA?

636
00:23:14,387 --> 00:23:15,303
She's lost too much blood.

637
00:23:15,387 --> 00:23:17,013
She couldn't
afford her insulin.

638
00:23:17,097 --> 00:23:18,183
She was healthy.

639
00:23:18,267 --> 00:23:19,593
She was doing everything
she needed to do.

640
00:23:19,677 --> 00:23:21,133
She was taking care
of her parents.

641
00:23:21,217 --> 00:23:22,473
She had her whole life
ahead of her.

642
00:23:22,557 --> 00:23:25,053
This shouldn't
have happened!

643
00:23:27,507 --> 00:23:29,803
<i>Dr. Crone to Peds ICU.</i>

644
00:23:29,887 --> 00:23:31,923
<i>Dr. Alexandria Crone
to Peds ICU.</i>

645
00:23:32,007 --> 00:23:33,177
Hey.

646
00:23:34,717 --> 00:23:37,093
I told Owen.

647
00:23:37,177 --> 00:23:40,183
Okay, did he...
Should someone warn Tom?

648
00:23:40,267 --> 00:23:42,383
No, not about that.

649
00:23:42,467 --> 00:23:44,593
About the baby,
about Amelia's baby.

650
00:23:44,677 --> 00:23:46,183
I told him
because she wouldn't

651
00:23:46,267 --> 00:23:47,683
and he deserves to know,

652
00:23:47,767 --> 00:23:50,923
and I deserve answers,
and Link deserves answers,

653
00:23:51,007 --> 00:23:53,133
and, I mean,
who does this?

654
00:23:53,217 --> 00:23:54,683
Who gets this far
into the pregnancy

655
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:55,973
and just toys
with people's feelings,

656
00:23:56,057 --> 00:23:57,343
with...
with their lives?

657
00:23:57,427 --> 00:23:59,263
I was just starting
to really like her.

658
00:23:59,347 --> 00:24:02,723
And I was just starting
to really like you.

659
00:24:02,807 --> 00:24:03,843
I mean, who does this?

660
00:24:03,927 --> 00:24:05,383
Who cheats on her fiancé

661
00:24:05,467 --> 00:24:08,013
with a man who is clearly
desperately in love with her?

662
00:24:08,097 --> 00:24:09,423
And before you go
judging Amelia,

663
00:24:09,507 --> 00:24:12,133
let's just take a second
to remember how long you waited

664
00:24:12,217 --> 00:24:14,097
before you told Owen
that you were pregnant.

665
00:24:15,967 --> 00:24:17,133
You're right.
You're right.

666
00:24:17,217 --> 00:24:18,343
I'm... I'm sorry.

667
00:24:18,427 --> 00:24:19,973
Yeah.

668
00:24:20,057 --> 00:24:22,383
That's my sister
you're talking about.

669
00:24:26,217 --> 00:24:28,513
Yeah, aside from
low Vitamin D levels

670
00:24:28,597 --> 00:24:30,633
and some ligament wear and tear
in your C-spine,

671
00:24:30,717 --> 00:24:32,383
you're the picture of health.

672
00:24:32,467 --> 00:24:35,423
When we have bad outcomes,
we tend to blame the conditions,

673
00:24:35,507 --> 00:24:37,303
but sometimes,
it's just human error.

674
00:24:37,387 --> 00:24:40,347
And we need to take the hit
and move on.

675
00:24:47,847 --> 00:24:49,183
You know, ironically,
I'm getting that,

676
00:24:49,267 --> 00:24:50,593
"You are the picture
of health,"

677
00:24:50,677 --> 00:24:53,923
is not the news
you were hoping to hear.

678
00:24:54,007 --> 00:24:55,053
You don't think there's
a chance

679
00:24:55,137 --> 00:24:56,808
that one of your team
made an error?

680
00:24:57,011 --> 00:25:01,223
More specifically,
um, that you made an error?

681
00:25:01,307 --> 00:25:06,553
I've read
about rare conditions...

682
00:25:06,637 --> 00:25:09,133
a tiny bubble in an artery,

683
00:25:09,217 --> 00:25:11,303
a blip that
most doctors would miss.

684
00:25:11,387 --> 00:25:14,013
I mean, if you were to find
something like that,

685
00:25:14,097 --> 00:25:15,513
it would explain
everything.

686
00:25:18,717 --> 00:25:20,973
The world
is falling apart, Tom,

687
00:25:21,057 --> 00:25:23,843
and people act like, "Well,
somebody's gonna save us."

688
00:25:23,927 --> 00:25:25,683
But I don't see
that person.

689
00:25:25,767 --> 00:25:27,763
And I sure as hell
can't be that person

690
00:25:27,847 --> 00:25:30,053
from a jail cell.

691
00:25:30,137 --> 00:25:33,053
Just think
of all the good you could do

692
00:25:33,137 --> 00:25:36,133
with my resources,
my cash.

693
00:25:36,217 --> 00:25:38,633
You could research
anything you wanted.

694
00:25:38,717 --> 00:25:40,263
You'd be a legend.

695
00:25:40,347 --> 00:25:42,973
And if anyone ever
caught you, you'd just say,

696
00:25:43,057 --> 00:25:45,923
"Uh, oops,
I misread his scan.

697
00:25:46,007 --> 00:25:48,633
Human error."

698
00:25:48,717 --> 00:25:50,973
Take another look
at the scans,

699
00:25:51,057 --> 00:25:53,513
just in case there's
something you missed.

700
00:26:11,043 --> 00:26:13,419
Okay, Tom,
my patient just died.

701
00:26:13,503 --> 00:26:15,509
So if your billionaire
needs a lollipop

702
00:26:15,593 --> 00:26:17,459
or a foot massage,
please go to someone else.

703
00:26:17,543 --> 00:26:18,799
If you had
his kind of money,

704
00:26:18,883 --> 00:26:20,423
what would you do
with it?

705
00:26:21,753 --> 00:26:23,299
Wh...

706
00:26:23,383 --> 00:26:25,419
I don't know.

707
00:26:25,503 --> 00:26:27,299
I'd triple the size
of the clinic.

708
00:26:27,464 --> 00:26:29,669
I'd make half our cases
pro bono.

709
00:26:29,753 --> 00:26:30,919
I could develop
a research lab

710
00:26:31,003 --> 00:26:32,249
and come up
with our own medicine

711
00:26:32,333 --> 00:26:34,129
so we could cut out
big pharma completely.

712
00:26:34,213 --> 00:26:35,419
Public healthcare
initiatives.

713
00:26:35,503 --> 00:26:37,169
We could put a stop
to food deserts.

714
00:26:37,253 --> 00:26:39,549
We could get healthcare
and nutrition to the homeless.

715
00:26:39,633 --> 00:26:41,049
The point is you'd do good,
lots of it,

716
00:26:41,133 --> 00:26:43,459
because this world
never runs out of people

717
00:26:43,543 --> 00:26:44,963
who need help.

718
00:26:47,043 --> 00:26:50,339
How do you decide
which rules to break?

719
00:26:50,423 --> 00:26:51,629
How do I decide?

720
00:26:51,713 --> 00:26:54,129
We're surgeons. We live by
rules, precedents, protocols.

721
00:26:54,213 --> 00:26:56,549
I mean, annoying as they are,
they reproduce success,

722
00:26:56,633 --> 00:27:00,645
so, Meredith Grey,
award-winning rule breaker,

723
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:03,564
how do you decide
which rules to break?

724
00:27:03,673 --> 00:27:05,566
I- I just go with my gut.

725
00:27:05,699 --> 00:27:07,339
And I hope that
whatever I'm doing

726
00:27:07,423 --> 00:27:11,209
improves this mess of a world
just a little bit.

727
00:27:18,833 --> 00:27:21,299
We believe he's out
of immediate danger,

728
00:27:21,383 --> 00:27:25,089
but there's no question
he's gonna have a long recovery.

729
00:27:25,173 --> 00:27:27,749
Does he have
family nearby?

730
00:27:27,833 --> 00:27:29,933
Yeah, um, I called.

731
00:27:30,018 --> 00:27:31,919
They're on the way.

732
00:27:32,003 --> 00:27:33,959
He'll also need
additional surgeries

733
00:27:34,043 --> 00:27:35,459
to treat the burns
and close the wounds

734
00:27:35,543 --> 00:27:38,209
on his arms and leg.

735
00:27:38,293 --> 00:27:40,009
Right.

736
00:27:40,093 --> 00:27:42,433
So...

737
00:27:42,881 --> 00:27:44,711
England...

738
00:27:47,963 --> 00:27:51,049
Um
whoever takes care of Brad

739
00:27:51,133 --> 00:27:53,809
needs to be prepared to spend
a lot of time in hospitals

740
00:27:53,894 --> 00:27:55,748
for a while.

741
00:27:55,833 --> 00:27:57,509
I can't... I can't do that.
I can't stay.

742
00:27:57,593 --> 00:27:58,709
You don't have to make
that decision right now.

743
00:27:58,793 --> 00:28:00,459
No, but I already decided.

744
00:28:00,543 --> 00:28:02,209
And... And he decided
to come with me,

745
00:28:02,293 --> 00:28:04,459
but I was always gonna go,
with or without him.

746
00:28:06,713 --> 00:28:09,269
What does it mean if
he would leave his dream for me,

747
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:12,551
but I... I won't
stay for him?

748
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,396
Wow.

749
00:28:25,543 --> 00:28:28,847
That went from forever to over
in less than a day.

750
00:28:30,003 --> 00:28:31,879
You called it, Jo.

751
00:28:31,963 --> 00:28:35,383
All love
sucks eventually.

752
00:28:37,793 --> 00:28:40,249
No.

753
00:28:40,333 --> 00:28:43,049
It doesn't suck.

754
00:28:43,133 --> 00:28:46,959
I've spent all week
trying to hate Alex,

755
00:28:47,043 --> 00:28:49,879
and nothing works.

756
00:28:49,963 --> 00:28:51,629
Because every time
I get into my car,

757
00:28:51,713 --> 00:28:53,379
I see
this little trash bag

758
00:28:53,463 --> 00:28:54,959
that he put
in my side pocket

759
00:28:55,043 --> 00:28:58,249
so that I had somewhere to put
my gum wrappers and tissues.

760
00:28:58,333 --> 00:29:01,799
And I felt...
I felt so loved

761
00:29:01,883 --> 00:29:04,879
that he did that.

762
00:29:04,963 --> 00:29:09,049
And now he put me
in the trash

763
00:29:09,133 --> 00:29:11,355
with the gum wrappers
and the tissues.

764
00:29:12,793 --> 00:29:15,133
I'm so mad.

765
00:29:17,713 --> 00:29:20,749
I'm so hurt.

766
00:29:20,833 --> 00:29:23,129
But I also know
that he is the reason

767
00:29:23,213 --> 00:29:24,839
that I will
get up again.

768
00:29:24,923 --> 00:29:26,549
I will climb out
of the trash,

769
00:29:26,633 --> 00:29:28,383
and I will rise.

770
00:29:30,503 --> 00:29:32,299
I'll rise so high

771
00:29:32,383 --> 00:29:34,839
that I'll make him a fool
for ever having left me,

772
00:29:34,923 --> 00:29:36,629
and I'll do it

773
00:29:36,713 --> 00:29:39,709
because of how well
he loved me.

774
00:29:39,793 --> 00:29:44,129
I am changed
because of him.

775
00:29:44,213 --> 00:29:46,749
He helped me
feel worthy of love,

776
00:29:46,833 --> 00:29:52,049
and even though
it's over,

777
00:29:52,133 --> 00:29:55,709
that is mine to keep.

778
00:30:00,003 --> 00:30:02,509
Link, don't blow it
with Amelia.

779
00:30:02,593 --> 00:30:04,749
I didn't do anything.

780
00:30:04,833 --> 00:30:06,879
She pushed me away.
She ended it.

781
00:30:06,963 --> 00:30:09,379
She didn't push you away.
She gave you a choice.

because it's...
it's minor.

833
00:32:44,383 --> 00:32:47,249
It's barely detectable.

834
00:32:47,333 --> 00:32:51,830
There's no doubt that it could
influence your judgment.

835
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:58,705
It's the sort of thing that,
uh, could resolve on its own,

836

surgery down the road.

843
00:33:32,665 --> 00:33:35,260

00:34:05,963 --> 00:34:07,839
move in and out on a whim,

858
00:34:07,923 --> 00:34:10,169
move in with a friend who
you tried to set up with my ex,

859

but, hey, it's all good.

Nah, it's not all good.

866
00:34:21,713 --> 00:34:23,209
Vic.

867
00:34:25,793 --> 00:34:27,709
- We moved really fast.
- Mm-hmm.

868
00:34:27,793 --> 00:34:29,959
I'm just saying we could
take a little time

869
00:34:30,043 --> 00:34:31,209
to get to know
each other better,

870
00:34:31,293 --> 00:34:33,589

You know,
on days like this,

877
00:35:02,543 --> 00:35:05,089
Alex would be the one
who would make me laugh.

878
00:35:05,173 --> 00:35:10,419
Dark, gallows humor,
but he made me laugh.

879
00:35:10,503 --> 00:35:12,919
My first day
of residency,

880
00:35:13,003 --> 00:35:15,589
when the chief gave us
that speech...

881
00:35:15,673 --> 00:35:18,799
you know, "The seven years
you spend here"...

882
00:35:18,883 --> 00:35:22,009
I stood in that room
dreaming of being

883
00:35:22,093 --> 00:35:25,209
the last one left
of my class,

884
00:35:25,293 --> 00:35:28,749
of being the kind of surgeon
that I have become,

885
00:35:28,833 --> 00:35:30,799

886
00:35:30,883 --> 00:35:36,129

they dropped off

887
00:35:36,213 --> 00:35:40,419

the only ones left.

888
00:35:40,511 --> 00:35:41,767

912

916
00:36:46,633 --> 00:36:49,209

917
00:36:49,293 --> 00:36:53,009
I feel that he might

and I thought you'd be starving,

955
00:38:47,333 --> 00:38:49,249
so I roasted a chicken,
and, yes,

956
00:38:49,333 --> 00:38:52,669

into the potatoes.

957

tell me the truth.
