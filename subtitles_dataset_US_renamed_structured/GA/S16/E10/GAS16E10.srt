<i>You're not in it alone.</i>

2
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:10,138
<i>Coming through!</i>

3
00:00:10,226 --> 00:00:13,774
<i>It's a nice thought,
but pretty useless in an O.R.</i>

4
00:00:14,061 --> 00:00:15,232
<i>Heads up!</i>

5
00:00:23,318 --> 00:00:24,498
<i>Behind you!</i>

6
00:00:26,426 --> 00:00:27,858
Get her to CT.

7
00:00:31,913 --> 00:00:33,602
<i>Clear trauma
one, two, and three.</i>

8
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:35,178
<i>And let CT know
we'll be rolling</i>

9
00:00:35,266 --> 00:00:36,526
upstairs in a few minutes.

10
00:00:37,854 --> 00:00:40,952
Uh, okay, these guys go straight
to the front of the line.

11
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,413
- Okay, Altman, take Parker.
- Got it.

12
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:45,702
Page everyone.
It's all hands on deck.

13
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:48,061
Come on.
Let's move. Move, move!

14
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:49,929
Hey, hey, hey, if you're gonna
be here, so am I, alright?

15
00:00:50,016 --> 00:00:51,529
Give me privileges.
I can hop in.

16
00:00:51,617 --> 00:00:54,957
Uh, okay, see if Altman
needs help with Parker.

17
00:00:55,045 --> 00:00:56,816
After that,
go where needed in the E.R.

18
00:00:56,904 --> 00:00:59,206
But, Ben, that's it.
I can't have you in an O.R.

19
00:01:01,085 --> 00:01:02,338
Okay, let's move.

20
00:01:02,426 --> 00:01:04,249
<i>The better you are
as a surgeon...</i>

21
00:01:06,306 --> 00:01:07,349
<i>...the more likely it is</i>

22
00:01:07,437 --> 00:01:09,913
<i>that no one else
can do what you can do.</i>

23
00:01:12,521 --> 00:01:14,920
A good outcome, a loss...

24
00:01:16,138 --> 00:01:19,464
100% of that
rests solely on your shoulders.

25
00:01:22,679 --> 00:01:24,701
<i>It's a ridiculous amount
of pressure.</i>

26
00:01:27,094 --> 00:01:28,459
- Schmitt.
- I'm sorry.

27
00:01:28,547 --> 00:01:30,291
I just... I-I-I-I don't know
why I'm in here.

28
00:01:30,378 --> 00:01:31,751
Oh, you were in the bar.

29
00:01:31,839 --> 00:01:34,462
Uh, are you hurt?
No.

30
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:35,592
I'm j... Uh, no.

31
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,597
I, uh... But my friends.

32
00:01:37,685 --> 00:01:39,639
Mm. I hear you.

33
00:01:43,742 --> 00:01:47,075
But right now,
your friends need your help.

34
00:01:47,225 --> 00:01:48,888
And mine, too.

35
00:01:48,975 --> 00:01:51,928
So, look,
whatever we're f-feeling,

36
00:01:52,215 --> 00:01:55,053
we put it aside
and we help.

37
00:01:56,524 --> 00:01:58,139
Come on, let's go.

38
00:01:59,193 --> 00:02:01,693
Let's go.
Let's go to work.

39
00:02:04,951 --> 00:02:07,232

Shh.

43
00:02:15,696 --> 00:02:18,185
He had a really hard day.

44
00:02:18,273 --> 00:02:21,542
Yeah, and it just got harder
'cause now he's been kidnapped.

45
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:22,912
I didn't kidnap him.

46
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,755
I just didn't take him
to the hospital right away.

47
00:02:24,842 --> 00:02:25,928
He wasn't ready.

48
00:02:26,015 --> 00:02:27,607
I-I don't think
a Safe Haven volunteer's

49
00:02:27,695 --> 00:02:28,780
supposed to make
that decision.

50
00:02:28,867 --> 00:02:31,551
I just wanted him
to have one cozy night

51
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:34,678
before a social worker turns him
into a pile of paperwork.

52
00:02:36,349 --> 00:02:37,623
Oh, my God.
It's the cops.

53
00:02:37,711 --> 00:02:38,990
Okay, okay.

54
00:02:39,078 --> 00:02:40,112
Wait, don't answer
the door.

55
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:41,179
Wait, wait!
Wait, wait!

56
00:02:41,266 --> 00:02:42,209
Answer the door,
and tell them

57
00:02:42,297 --> 00:02:44,972
that I brought the baby here
for a wellness check with Alex.

58
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,348
He's a peds doctor.

59
00:02:46,435 --> 00:02:47,592
He's in Iowa.

60
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,990
Who is it?

61
00:02:49,078 --> 00:02:50,115
It's Meredith.

62
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:52,709
Oh, it's Meredith.
Let her in.

63
00:02:54,358 --> 00:02:55,401
You're not Alex.

64
00:02:55,489 --> 00:02:57,482
Oh, yeah, he's, uh,
visiting his mom.

65
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:00,273
Well, Cristina sent
an obnoxious Irishman as a gift

66
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:02,420
and he stole
your husband's old job.

67
00:03:02,508 --> 00:03:03,631
And who is that?

68
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:04,963
Oh, we already have
a bottle open.

69
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:06,492
Can you get her a glass?

70
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:07,599
Jo stole a baby.

71
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:09,544
I did not steal a baby.

72
00:03:09,632 --> 00:03:11,296
Well, that's what I said
when I stole a baby.

73
00:03:11,383 --> 00:03:12,609
Why are people
stealing babies?

74
00:03:12,697 --> 00:03:13,910
He was left
at Station 19,

75
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:15,768
and they called me
to take him to the hospital,

76
00:03:15,855 --> 00:03:17,281
and I... didn't.

77
00:03:17,369 --> 00:03:19,258
Well, because you didn't want
him to go into the system

78
00:03:19,345 --> 00:03:20,918
and have a miserable life
like you did.

79
00:03:21,006 --> 00:03:22,799
Exactly.
She gets it.

80
00:03:22,887 --> 00:03:24,171
But I'm a convicted felon.

81
00:03:24,259 --> 00:03:25,883
She's a convicted felon.

82
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:28,223
- She's a felon.
- She's a convicted felon.

83
00:03:28,645 --> 00:03:29,921
Oh, no.

84
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:31,612
Multiple traumas.

85
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:32,968
We should go back
to the hospital.

86
00:03:33,055 --> 00:03:35,224
You know what?
I've had two glasses of wine,

87
00:03:35,312 --> 00:03:36,598
- so I really can't.
- Don't worry.

88
00:03:36,685 --> 00:03:39,148
We'll call on the way,
tell peds a Safe Haven's there

89
00:03:39,236 --> 00:03:40,529
waiting for
a wellness check.

90
00:03:40,617 --> 00:03:42,005
You can sneak him
into the nursery,

91
00:03:42,093 --> 00:03:43,420
pretend he's been there
all night...

92
00:03:43,507 --> 00:03:45,257
Like he should
have been.

93
00:03:45,431 --> 00:03:47,679
Come on.

94
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:53,552
Hey, I just heard.
Is everyone alive?

95
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,687
So far.

96
00:03:54,863 --> 00:03:57,302
Uh, do you know
if Maggie has been paged?

97
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:59,554
I kinda have a thing,
a personal... a talk thing,

98
00:03:59,642 --> 00:04:01,919
need to... a girl talk.
Uh, girl thing.

99
00:04:02,007 --> 00:04:03,058
Can you smile for me?

100
00:04:03,145 --> 00:04:04,382
Ew, don't be that guy,
Tom.

101
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:05,889
No, I want to make sure
you're not having a stroke.

102
00:04:05,976 --> 00:04:07,874
- Pierce quit.
- What? Why?

103
00:04:07,962 --> 00:04:09,178
<i>Dr. Mahoney to the E.R.</i>

104
00:04:09,265 --> 00:04:10,624
Hey, big trauma?

105
00:04:10,712 --> 00:04:11,820
You should head upstairs.

106
00:04:11,908 --> 00:04:14,347
Elliott Calhoun was just
transferred to the CCU on ECMO.

107
00:04:14,435 --> 00:04:17,294
Go up there, sit with him,
hold his wife's hand, whatever.

108
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:18,483
His heart
still hasn't restarted.

109
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:20,085
I'm chief resident.
I-I should go...

110
00:04:20,173 --> 00:04:22,217
He has a premature baby
and a hole in his chest.

111
00:04:22,305 --> 00:04:24,148
You should go
where I say you should go.

112
00:04:25,824 --> 00:04:26,976
We need more O-neg!

113
00:04:27,064 --> 00:04:29,007
I need some
bandages over here.

114
00:04:29,095 --> 00:04:30,646
Get his vitals
right away.

115
00:04:30,734 --> 00:04:32,023
How bad is it?

116
00:04:32,555 --> 00:04:34,848
Simms and Helm
got the worst of it...

117
00:04:34,935 --> 00:04:36,990
Well, if you don't count
the couple who were in the car.

118
00:04:38,009 --> 00:04:39,888
It's okay,
it's okay, it's okay.

119
00:04:39,976 --> 00:04:41,484
Who is that?

120
00:04:41,679 --> 00:04:43,835
Dr. Karev
is a Safe Haven volunteer,

121
00:04:43,923 --> 00:04:46,083
and she is taking the baby
to the nursery.

122
00:04:46,171 --> 00:04:47,496
Right, Dr. Karev?

123
00:04:47,584 --> 00:04:50,007
Yep. Here I go.

124
00:04:52,765 --> 00:04:56,308
So, how'd the ultrasound go?
Everything okay?

125
00:04:56,484 --> 00:04:58,437
Everything is...

126
00:04:58,595 --> 00:05:02,768
Yes. Uh, baby's healthy,
uh, great, developing.

127
00:05:02,855 --> 00:05:05,687
Uh, Lincoln, Shepherd,
can you guys jump in here?

128
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:08,888
Not only are we swamped,
but we're short-staffed.

129
00:05:09,015 --> 00:05:11,562
Well, not anymore,
because I've called in reinforcements.

130
00:05:11,671 --> 00:05:13,308
Wha... Webber and Hunt were
fired from this hospital.

131
00:05:13,395 --> 00:05:14,320
Lay off, Koracick.

132
00:05:14,408 --> 00:05:16,732
Look, I don't care.
They are my students.

133
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:18,109
I hired them.

134
00:05:18,624 --> 00:05:21,177
Okay, temporary privileges granted.
We need the help.

135
00:05:21,265 --> 00:05:23,598
Everyone, gowns and gloves,
and keep up.

136
00:05:25,685 --> 00:05:27,997
Blake Simms,
mid-face instability,

137
00:05:28,085 --> 00:05:30,421
criked in the field.
Needs to head up to CT ASAP.

138
00:05:30,509 --> 00:05:31,982
- Hunt, join Avery.
- Yep.

139
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:34,124
I should be in here.
In case there's any neuro.

140
00:05:34,452 --> 00:05:37,023
Any other requests
from the peanut gallery?

141
00:05:37,334 --> 00:05:39,218
Good. Moving on.

142
00:05:39,909 --> 00:05:42,857

tib-fib fracture,

144
00:05:44,234 --> 00:05:46,755
but complains of pain
in the pelvis,

145
00:05:46,843 --> 00:05:49,827
so we need a pelvic X-ray,
chest X-ray,

146
00:05:49,915 --> 00:05:51,007
F.A.S.T. exam,
the works.

147
00:05:51,095 --> 00:05:52,992
Webber,
Lincoln, Grey, go.

148
00:05:54,038 --> 00:05:55,590
Where's Andrew DeLuca?

149
00:05:55,676 --> 00:05:57,335
Uh, around here
somewhere.

150
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,027
No, with patients.

151

- He's okay, Meredith.

152
00:06:01,165 --> 00:06:02,226
Okay.

Casey Parker... he took
a nasty blow to the head.

154

He's got a palpable
scalp hematoma.

155
00:06:06,585 --> 00:06:07,507

156
00:06:07,595 --> 00:06:08,918
We're taking him up
to CT now.

157
00:06:09,006 --> 00:06:10,749

00:06:48,679 --> 00:06:50,320
She's working through
a miscarriage.

174
00:06:50,408 --> 00:06:52,179
She hasn't had time
to take a break yet.

175
00:06:52,267 --> 00:06:55,557
I... I can't be there
in that O.R. with her,

176
00:06:55,645 --> 00:06:58,218
so someone else who loves her
needs to be there.

177
00:06:58,306 --> 00:07:00,374
In case she breaks.
Of course.

178
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:01,749
Thank you.

179
00:07:02,094 --> 00:07:03,390
Warren.

180
00:07:03,928 --> 00:07:05,296
Are you okay?

181
00:07:05,429 --> 00:07:06,508
No.

182
00:07:06,595 --> 00:07:08,749
But Miranda comes first.

183
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:12,062
<i>♪ Mm-mm-mm,
mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm ♪</i>

184
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:14,390
<i>♪ Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm,
mm-mm-mm ♪</i>

185
00:07:15,038 --> 00:07:16,320
There was a bomb.

186
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:19,984
No, Casey, it wasn't
a bomb. It was a car.

187
00:07:20,098 --> 00:07:21,577
Stay nice and still, okay?

188
00:07:21,665 --> 00:07:22,808
Are we in the green zone?

189
00:07:22,896 --> 00:07:24,195
He was
in the military, right?

190
00:07:24,283 --> 00:07:25,348
Mm.

191
00:07:25,435 --> 00:07:27,046
Do you think he has PTSD?

192
00:07:27,327 --> 00:07:28,598
We all do.

193
00:07:28,796 --> 00:07:30,695
War. Life.

194
00:07:32,764 --> 00:07:34,265
How far along are you?

195
00:07:34,724 --> 00:07:36,507
Oh, um...

196
00:07:36,679 --> 00:07:38,398
20 weeks-ish?

197
00:07:38,589 --> 00:07:40,172
They're always a little off,
though, right?

198
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:43,042
With the whole
counting-from-ovulation thing?

199
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:44,413
When I hit 30 weeks,

200
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,726
I thought
I was gonna pop.

201
00:07:49,038 --> 00:07:50,632
Temporal lobe contusion.

202
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,053
Yeah, explains
the PTSD exacerbation.

203
00:07:53,141 --> 00:07:55,669
He needs to be in the neuro ICU,
closely monitored,

204
00:07:55,757 --> 00:07:57,468
with q2 hour checks.

205
00:07:57,555 --> 00:07:59,450
Dr. Shepherd,
I just stepped out for a minute

206
00:07:59,538 --> 00:08:01,515
to prep the next patient,
and when I came back...

207
00:08:12,118 --> 00:08:13,812
Hi, Doctor.
Oh, my God. Ah.

208
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:16,161
Chief, there seem to be
a lot of doctors in here,

209
00:08:16,249 --> 00:08:17,891
and I don't want to get in
the way of anyone,

210
00:08:17,978 --> 00:08:19,507
- specifically...
- You're in my way.

211
00:08:19,595 --> 00:08:21,427
Move. Forward.
How are we?

212
00:08:21,515 --> 00:08:23,413
- Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- I'm fantastic.

213
00:08:24,025 --> 00:08:25,398
Dr. Grey is here.

214
00:08:25,617 --> 00:08:27,570
- Hi, Dr. Grey.
- Hi, Helm.

215
00:08:27,658 --> 00:08:29,436
Jackson gave her
a whiskey sedative at the scene

216
00:08:29,523 --> 00:08:30,468
to set her leg.

217
00:08:30,556 --> 00:08:32,140
I just gave her a little bit
of fentanyl for the pain.

218
00:08:32,227 --> 00:08:34,257
And the X-ray doesn't show
pelvic fractures.

219
00:08:34,345 --> 00:08:37,338
CT showed an infrarenal
IVC injury with a clot...

220
00:08:37,426 --> 00:08:38,452
That's near my kidney.

221
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:41,208
It also showed
a small retrohepatic hematoma

222
00:08:41,296 --> 00:08:43,265
- by the IVC.
- Oh, no.

223
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:44,898
I'm bruised in the liver.

224
00:08:44,986 --> 00:08:47,189
Doppler shows, uh,
vascular compromise to the foot,

225
00:08:47,337 --> 00:08:49,427
which is probably due
to the fracture,

226
00:08:49,515 --> 00:08:51,460
so I'd like to get her
to an O.R. ASAP.

227
00:08:51,586 --> 00:08:53,310
We should put in
an IVC filter

228
00:08:53,398 --> 00:08:55,357
to reduce the risk
of pulmonary embolism. - Mm.

229
00:08:55,445 --> 00:08:57,054
But he just said
my foot could die.

230
00:08:57,142 --> 00:08:59,345
Don't worry, Helm, we got you.
She's not wrong.

231
00:08:59,433 --> 00:09:00,492
I can do the filter

232
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:02,508
while she's getting prepped
in the O.R. for her leg.

233
00:09:02,595 --> 00:09:04,851
Okay.
Let's get to work.

234
00:09:08,102 --> 00:09:09,451
Can I scrub in?

235
00:09:09,539 --> 00:09:10,906
Sure.

236
00:09:11,664 --> 00:09:12,789
Bailey.

237
00:09:12,877 --> 00:09:15,891
Uh, you have full privileges,
so jump in wherever needed.

238
00:09:15,979 --> 00:09:17,398
Uh, Ben called me.

239
00:09:18,288 --> 00:09:19,945
He shouldn't have
done that.

240
00:09:20,874 --> 00:09:24,070
But like I said,
jump in wherever needed.

241
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:25,640
Look.

242
00:09:29,148 --> 00:09:30,358
Where are we
on Blake Simms?

243
00:09:30,446 --> 00:09:33,109
Uh, doesn't appear to be any
traumatic brain injuries.

244
00:09:33,303 --> 00:09:34,716
Leave that
to the expert, Red.

245
00:09:34,841 --> 00:09:38,430
Yep, no epidural, subdural,
or subarachnoid hemorrhage.

246
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:39,944
How many of these
have you done?

247
00:09:40,032 --> 00:09:41,035
Me?

248
00:09:41,185 --> 00:09:42,531
I'm sure
it's in our records.

249
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:43,461
More than 20?

250
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:45,149
This is a rare injury,
the surgery extensive...

251
00:09:45,236 --> 00:09:46,739
I have had
a long night, Tom.

252
00:09:46,831 --> 00:09:48,321
I don't have the energy
to defend myself

253
00:09:48,408 --> 00:09:49,888
to you. - I'm well aware
of your night, Avery.

254
00:09:49,975 --> 00:09:52,584
It's just dumb luck those scans
aren't of you. Or Brody.

255
00:09:52,672 --> 00:09:54,482
You're about to peel off
my protégé's face

256
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:56,624
and bolt his fractured facial
bones back into their place.

257
00:09:56,711 --> 00:09:57,735
I want to make
sure that you're in

258
00:09:57,822 --> 00:09:59,312
the right state of
mind to do that.

259
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,297
I'm good.

260
00:10:01,678 --> 00:10:03,133
Go babysit someone else.

261
00:10:03,221 --> 00:10:06,134
Okay, let's, um,
take him up to the O.R.

262
00:10:06,332 --> 00:10:07,951
Brody, do you know
of any relatives

263
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:09,086
that we can
reach out to?

264
00:10:09,174 --> 00:10:11,235
I didn't even know his first
name till I saw it on the scan.

265
00:10:11,322 --> 00:10:13,508
His grandmother's local.
I'll call her.

266
00:10:13,596 --> 00:10:15,711
Brody,
just get him to the O.R.

267
00:10:24,804 --> 00:10:26,164
- Hi.
- Hello.

268
00:10:26,867 --> 00:10:28,633
So, who do we have here?

269
00:10:28,721 --> 00:10:31,562
Oh, Dr. Karev.
Jo Karev.

270
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:33,609
Nice to meet you.
But I meant the baby.

271
00:10:33,725 --> 00:10:36,076
Oh, right, yes.
Uh, so, boy.

272
00:10:36,164 --> 00:10:37,848
- Less than three days old.
- Mm-hmm.

273
00:10:37,935 --> 00:10:39,508
Bottle feeding's
been good.

274
00:10:39,595 --> 00:10:41,646
- He's sleeping well.
- Mm-hmm.

275
00:10:41,734 --> 00:10:43,718
Good job.
Oh, there we go.

276
00:10:43,805 --> 00:10:45,602
Okay.

277
00:10:45,737 --> 00:10:48,209
Let's get that hat off.
Let's have a look. Shh.

278
00:10:48,297 --> 00:10:51,008
- Normal chest contour.
- Okay.

279
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,250
Motor function.
Oh, yeah.

280
00:10:53,523 --> 00:10:55,758
Does this hospital
have a baby hatch?

281
00:10:55,897 --> 00:10:57,347
A what?

282
00:10:57,435 --> 00:10:58,773
A baby hatch.

283
00:10:59,007 --> 00:11:01,664
It's like a post box
but for babies.

284
00:11:01,935 --> 00:11:03,678
That sounds not great.

285
00:11:03,765 --> 00:11:04,758
No, actually,
they're brilliant.

286
00:11:04,846 --> 00:11:06,539
Decorated like
a little nursery inside,

287
00:11:06,627 --> 00:11:07,807
connect
straight to the E.R.

288
00:11:07,895 --> 00:11:09,164
Mum puts the baby in.

289
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:11,312
A sensor notifies
the staff to come.

290
00:11:11,468 --> 00:11:14,006
My last hospital had one.
They're safe and anonymous.

291
00:11:14,094 --> 00:11:15,445
Where was
your last hospital?

292
00:11:15,533 --> 00:11:17,109
That was in Switzerland.

293
00:11:17,265 --> 00:11:18,445
Oh, you're him?

294
00:11:19,231 --> 00:11:20,145
Him?

295
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:22,111
You're new guy.

296
00:11:22,237 --> 00:11:24,597
New chief of peds guy.

297
00:11:24,685 --> 00:11:26,180
Well, yes,
I suppose I am.

298
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:28,178
Oh, you're related
to the old chief of peds? Okay.

299
00:11:28,265 --> 00:11:29,609
Yes. Wife.

300
00:11:29,697 --> 00:11:30,860
I've heard good things.

301
00:11:30,952 --> 00:11:32,562
About me?

302
00:11:33,373 --> 00:11:34,906
Um, no,

303
00:11:35,002 --> 00:11:37,570
but, um,
let's have a listen.

304
00:11:38,516 --> 00:11:39,598
I got nothing.

305
00:11:39,685 --> 00:11:41,170
- You?
- Nothing.

306
00:11:41,258 --> 00:11:43,250
- Hey.
- Hey.

307
00:11:43,414 --> 00:11:44,434
What are you doing
up here?

308
00:11:44,521 --> 00:11:45,974
Uh, scrubbing in
with Avery on Simms.

309
00:11:46,062 --> 00:11:47,123
Type III
Le Fort fracture.

310
00:11:47,211 --> 00:11:48,009
- Ugh.
- Oof.

311
00:11:48,096 --> 00:11:50,156
Yeah, it's bad.
And Koracick's leaning heavy on

312
00:11:50,244 --> 00:11:51,968
Avery to get
the reconstruction right.

313
00:11:52,055 --> 00:11:54,357
Well, making sure we get things
right is Tom's job.

314
00:11:54,445 --> 00:11:55,638
Yeah, well,
being an ass about it isn't.

315
00:11:55,725 --> 00:11:56,767
What are you two
looking for?

316
00:11:56,854 --> 00:11:59,045
Parker's MIA
with a temporal lobe contusion

317
00:11:59,133 --> 00:12:01,570
and a nasty episode of PTSD
about a really big bomb.

318
00:12:01,658 --> 00:12:03,030
Well, if I were scared
about a bomb,

319
00:12:03,117 --> 00:12:04,898
I'd be looking
for a bomb shelter.

320
00:12:05,415 --> 00:12:06,888
Maybe check the morgue
and the basement,

321
00:12:06,975 --> 00:12:08,306
and I'll meet you in security.

322
00:12:08,393 --> 00:12:09,310
- Owen.
- Yeah?

323
00:12:09,398 --> 00:12:10,789
Cut Tom some slack.

324
00:12:23,413 --> 00:12:25,786
Umbrella filter
has been deployed.

325
00:12:26,273 --> 00:12:28,331
She's got
the umbrella in.

326
00:12:28,435 --> 00:12:30,678
Thank you, Helm.
You're welcome.

327
00:12:30,765 --> 00:12:33,558
Are you gonna fix
my tib-fib, too?

328
00:12:33,645 --> 00:12:35,373
I don't do bones.

329
00:12:35,461 --> 00:12:37,219
Me neither.

330
00:12:37,368 --> 00:12:39,886
And these are not
regular bones.

331
00:12:39,974 --> 00:12:42,758
These are my bones.

332
00:12:43,171 --> 00:12:44,828
Helm bones.

333
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:47,352
Helmones.

334
00:12:48,515 --> 00:12:50,742
Helm-mouth.
I get it.

335
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:52,573
Dr. Schmitt,
let's prep her,

336
00:12:52,661 --> 00:12:54,359
and let's remind Dr. Kim
and Dr. Lincoln

337
00:12:54,447 --> 00:12:57,430
to check her neck for hematomas
and recheck her H&H.

338
00:12:57,518 --> 00:12:59,371
- Mm, no, no.
- No Schmitt.

339
00:12:59,459 --> 00:13:00,889
It's his fault
you left me.

340
00:13:00,977 --> 00:13:04,437
- Helm...
- He got the love of my life fired.

341
00:13:05,265 --> 00:13:06,680
Which is you.

342
00:13:07,109 --> 00:13:08,625
Surprise.

343
00:13:09,327 --> 00:13:11,703
I love you,
Meredith Grey.

344
00:13:12,076 --> 00:13:15,057
And I know it's stupid
and I should get over it,

345
00:13:15,145 --> 00:13:19,086
and I will
if I ever meet anyone else.

346
00:13:20,052 --> 00:13:22,398
I'm starting to think
I never will.

347
00:13:24,914 --> 00:13:28,555
I'm embarrassed now, so I'm...
I'm gonna go prep myself.

348
00:13:28,711 --> 00:13:31,023
Thank you for that, Helm.

349
00:13:31,111 --> 00:13:32,123
Thank you.

350
00:13:32,211 --> 00:13:34,381
We'll have Dr. Kim
prep you, okay?

351
00:13:34,469 --> 00:13:35,859
Kim's a traitor-lover.

352
00:13:35,947 --> 00:13:38,047
Schmitt,
let's go downstairs.

353
00:13:38,645 --> 00:13:40,031
Dr. Schmitt?

354
00:13:41,762 --> 00:13:43,773
- Hey! Guys!
- Oh, my God. Levi.

355
00:13:45,086 --> 00:13:46,398
Schmitt.

356
00:13:55,577 --> 00:13:58,387
What?
What's happening?

357
00:14:00,227 --> 00:14:02,115
You fainted in the O.R.,
Schmitt.

358
00:14:02,203 --> 00:14:03,656
I'm doing
a full work-up.

359
00:14:03,744 --> 00:14:06,787
I fainted and you're okay
being my doctor?

360
00:14:06,935 --> 00:14:08,984
I couldn't really leave you
there on the O.R. floor.

361
00:14:09,072 --> 00:14:10,922
They could take away
my license for that.

362
00:14:11,047 --> 00:14:12,842
Your blood work
all looks good,

363
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:15,718
except for your cardiac enzymes
are slightly elevated,

364
00:14:15,805 --> 00:14:16,768
which could indicate...

365
00:14:16,855 --> 00:14:17,888
I'm having a heart attack?

366
00:14:17,975 --> 00:14:20,428
That's very unlikely
at your age,

367
00:14:20,515 --> 00:14:22,598
but I'm gonna do an echo
just to be sure.

368
00:14:22,685 --> 00:14:24,195
I'm not even 30.

369
00:14:24,711 --> 00:14:27,267
I take fish oil
every morning.

370
00:14:27,355 --> 00:14:29,348
And, y-yeah,
I had double cheeseburgers

371
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:30,398
every day freshman year,

372
00:14:30,486 --> 00:14:33,387
but since then,
I-I've been pretty good.

373
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:36,453
Okay, but you do need
to calm down, Schmitt.

374
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:37,618
Okay?

375
00:14:37,706 --> 00:14:39,578
Is there anyone
I can call for you?

376
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:42,597
Well, I'd say my mom,
but she'd only panic.

377
00:14:42,685 --> 00:14:44,678
Probably have
her own heart attack.

378
00:14:44,765 --> 00:14:46,308
And then I'd say
Taryn Helm,

379
00:14:46,395 --> 00:14:49,098
but she hates me
because of what I did to you,

380
00:14:49,185 --> 00:14:50,240
and she's dying.

381
00:14:50,328 --> 00:14:51,678
So then I'd say Nico,

382
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:53,678
but he's in the O.R.,
saving Taryn's life.

383
00:14:55,783 --> 00:14:57,092
There's no one to call.

384
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:58,388
Take a deep breath,
Schmitt.

385
00:15:00,244 --> 00:15:01,484
I gotcha.

386
00:15:03,997 --> 00:15:05,203
Any updates?

387
00:15:06,046 --> 00:15:08,331
We just finished
temporarily wiring his jaw,

388
00:15:08,419 --> 00:15:09,992
and now we're doing
our coronal incision

389
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,359
to expose the superior orbit
and zygoma.

390
00:15:12,447 --> 00:15:14,867
Alright, keep me posted.
Every update.

391
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:15,969
You know what, Tom?

392
00:15:16,057 --> 00:15:17,508
You might as well
bring in a camera crew here.

393
00:15:17,595 --> 00:15:18,928
Really great press.

394
00:15:19,015 --> 00:15:21,808
Plenty of human drama
and vulnerability to exploit.

395
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:23,297
You'd love it.

396
00:15:23,949 --> 00:15:24,942
- No?
- Okay.

397
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:26,500
Lap pads.

398
00:15:28,305 --> 00:15:30,308
I do not miss that guy.

399
00:15:30,395 --> 00:15:31,928
Nope. Suction.

400
00:15:32,133 --> 00:15:34,412
Altman could do
so much better.

401
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,888
Meaning?

402
00:15:36,023 --> 00:15:37,508
Are you serious?

403
00:15:37,766 --> 00:15:38,928
Altman's a badass.

404
00:15:39,015 --> 00:15:41,598
She's smart and skilled
and hot.

405
00:15:41,685 --> 00:15:44,508
Koracick's just like
a creepy frat-house uncle.

406
00:15:44,595 --> 00:15:47,172
She has done better, Brody.
She's with Hunt.

407
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:49,765
Periosteal elevator,
please.

408
00:15:49,859 --> 00:15:51,953
Oh, I'm so sorry.

409
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:53,530
It's just the way
that he talks to her...

410
00:15:53,617 --> 00:15:55,218
Yeah, don't worry about it.

411
00:15:55,305 --> 00:15:57,098
Skin hooks, please.

412
00:15:57,185 --> 00:16:00,559
Owen, these flaps
are coming along pretty nicely.

413
00:16:01,144 --> 00:16:03,549
Speaking of which, how are you two doing?
You set a date yet?

414
00:16:03,637 --> 00:16:06,449
W-We're...
We're not engaged.

415
00:16:06,537 --> 00:16:08,121
- Really?
- Mnh-mnh.

416
00:16:08,498 --> 00:16:11,557
Wow. I figured 'cause you have
two kids together,

417
00:16:11,645 --> 00:16:13,246
you live together,
you marry everyone...

418
00:16:13,334 --> 00:16:16,346
but... I guess you have been busy,
haven't you?

419
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:19,449
Okay, let's, um, take a look
at these fractures.

420
00:16:19,746 --> 00:16:20,826
Sure.

421
00:16:23,469 --> 00:16:25,187
Almost done here.

422
00:16:25,601 --> 00:16:27,078
If you want to tap out,
it's cool.

423
00:16:27,245 --> 00:16:28,414
I'm fine.

424
00:16:29,406 --> 00:16:31,242
Your boyfriend
did just collapse.

425
00:16:31,555 --> 00:16:33,387
Helm needed
a plate and screws,

426
00:16:33,475 --> 00:16:35,859
so I'm doing
a plate and screws.

427
00:16:36,093 --> 00:16:37,468
Me stopping to freak out

428
00:16:37,555 --> 00:16:39,303
won't change the outcome
of Levi's condition.

429
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:41,062
And, plus,
Helm is Levi's best friend.

430
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:42,101
Fair enough.

431
00:16:43,911 --> 00:16:45,364
She's hypotensive
and tachycardic.

432
00:16:45,467 --> 00:16:47,546
- Page Bailey.
- Right away, Dr. Lincoln.

433
00:16:49,554 --> 00:16:50,818
He's not in the morgue.

434
00:16:50,906 --> 00:16:53,187
Did you check the exits?

435
00:16:53,423 --> 00:16:55,560
Backed up all the tapes
half an hour.

436
00:16:55,648 --> 00:16:56,690
I didn't see him leave.

437
00:16:56,778 --> 00:16:58,257
Here's the basement.

438
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:02,765
I can do this without you
if you want to go.

439
00:17:02,912 --> 00:17:04,710
He's a veteran
and he's suffering.

440
00:17:04,798 --> 00:17:07,875
We send people overseas and we
ask them to give up their lives,

441
00:17:08,257 --> 00:17:09,507
their health,
their families,

442
00:17:09,595 --> 00:17:10,554
and when they come home,

443
00:17:10,642 --> 00:17:12,515
we don't even give them
mental health care.

444
00:17:13,688 --> 00:17:14,818
Owen.

445
00:17:15,574 --> 00:17:18,476
And Riggs. And Megan.
And...

446
00:17:19,146 --> 00:17:20,653
And me.

447
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:22,745
I can't imagine.

448
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:23,989
Do you think that Owen's...

449
00:17:24,077 --> 00:17:25,934
God.
Forget it.

450
00:17:26,022 --> 00:17:29,020
It's not appropriate.

451
00:17:29,778 --> 00:17:31,388
Do I think Owen's what?

452
00:17:31,614 --> 00:17:33,692
Mm, triggered.

453
00:17:33,874 --> 00:17:36,090
PTSD is about patterns.

454
00:17:36,551 --> 00:17:39,217
Owen has a history
of feeling trapped.

455
00:17:39,305 --> 00:17:42,428
By fear of disappointing,
fear of hurting people,

456
00:17:42,515 --> 00:17:43,614
trapped by obligations.

457
00:17:43,702 --> 00:17:47,223
And I arrived here with a belly
full of a heavy obligation.

458
00:17:50,177 --> 00:17:53,466
Honestly, Teddy, I don't think
that Owen is triggered.

459
00:17:53,554 --> 00:17:55,082
I think...

460
00:17:55,692 --> 00:17:56,969
he loves you.

461
00:17:57,056 --> 00:17:58,512
Well,
he hasn't proposed.

462
00:17:58,663 --> 00:18:02,682
And I feel really embarrassed
saying that out loud,

463
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:04,465
but it's, uh...

464
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:09,137
You know, it's... it's not like
I'm a stupid little girl

465
00:18:09,225 --> 00:18:12,008
waiting for a ring
from a man.

466
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:13,504
- It's just...
- Hang on.

467
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:16,356
If he felt trapped
by an obligation,

468
00:18:16,444 --> 00:18:18,590
don't you think
he would've proposed by now?

469
00:18:21,457 --> 00:18:23,786
I really think
he's just...

470
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,098
trying to do things
differently.

471
00:18:28,355 --> 00:18:33,354
You are incredibly kind,
Amelia Shepherd.

472
00:18:37,871 --> 00:18:38,968
There.

473
00:18:39,395 --> 00:18:40,840
Parker.

474
00:18:41,604 --> 00:18:43,379
The hyperbaric chamber.

475
00:18:44,344 --> 00:18:45,391
Bomb shelter.

476
00:18:45,594 --> 00:18:47,032
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

477
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:49,293
Talk to me.

478
00:18:49,674 --> 00:18:51,757
We repaired her leg, and her
vitals just plummeted.

479
00:18:51,855 --> 00:18:53,848
She's hypotensive
with a worsening base deficit.

480
00:18:53,935 --> 00:18:56,058
Uh, did you check
her abdomen?

481
00:18:56,471 --> 00:18:57,680
No.

482
00:18:59,796 --> 00:19:01,836
Abdomen's distended.

483
00:19:01,924 --> 00:19:04,137
Okay, prep for an ex-lap
and call Dr. Grey.

484
00:19:04,225 --> 00:19:05,461
Okay.
I-I can assist.

485
00:19:05,549 --> 00:19:06,782
Dr. Webber.

486
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:08,073
Look, I hired Dr. Helm.

487
00:19:08,161 --> 00:19:09,750
I'm gonna help,
and you can't stop me.

488
00:19:39,942 --> 00:19:42,395
- His heart.
- What is it? What's wrong?

489
00:19:42,506 --> 00:19:44,459
It's coming back.
It's... It's beating.

490
00:19:44,547 --> 00:19:45,840
His heart's beating.

491
00:19:45,928 --> 00:19:48,319
Okay, uh, need to try
and wean him off

492
00:19:48,407 --> 00:19:49,571
the pacing wires and ECMO.

493
00:19:49,659 --> 00:19:50,678
Oh, my God.

494
00:19:50,766 --> 00:19:51,844
Page Dr. Altman.

495
00:19:51,932 --> 00:19:54,012
- Right away, Doctor.
- Oh, my God.

496
00:20:03,982 --> 00:20:05,211
Parker?

497
00:20:05,467 --> 00:20:06,960
We got incoming.

498
00:20:07,477 --> 00:20:10,047
Lieutenant Parker,
permission to approach.

499
00:20:13,037 --> 00:20:14,524
Hi.

500
00:20:15,191 --> 00:20:16,564
I am right here,
Parker.

501
00:20:16,652 --> 00:20:19,203
We're in a hospital.
You're at Grey-Sloan.

502
00:20:19,836 --> 00:20:21,201
Hey.

503
00:20:21,289 --> 00:20:22,388
We're safe.

504
00:20:22,578 --> 00:20:23,946
Okay?

505
00:20:24,331 --> 00:20:26,348
You want to come with me
and we'll get you some help?

506
00:20:27,805 --> 00:20:29,868
Okay.
I got you.

507
00:20:29,956 --> 00:20:31,649
I got you. Yep.

508
00:20:31,744 --> 00:20:33,703
I got you.

509
00:20:33,977 --> 00:20:35,766
Here we go.
It's alright.

510
00:20:40,038 --> 00:20:41,110
Oh.

511
00:20:41,555 --> 00:20:44,922
Dr. Altman, Elliott Calhoun's
heart started beating again.

512
00:20:45,055 --> 00:20:46,436
He's ready to
come off ECMO.

513
00:20:46,524 --> 00:20:47,968
Whoa.
Parker, what happened?

514
00:20:48,055 --> 00:20:49,439
He took a blow to the head
at Joe's.

515
00:20:49,526 --> 00:20:50,438
Did you get into
a bar fight?

516
00:20:50,526 --> 00:20:52,637
There was an accident
at Joe's Bar.

517
00:20:52,725 --> 00:20:54,462
Casey and some
of the residents were there.

518
00:20:54,549 --> 00:20:57,610
We are taking him up to the ICU
to monitor his contusion.

519
00:20:57,930 --> 00:20:59,780
Damn it.
Grey needs me.

520
00:20:59,868 --> 00:21:01,298
- It... It's Schmitt.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

521
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:02,639
Schmitt was there, too?
What the hell happened?

522
00:21:02,726 --> 00:21:04,188
Apparently,
it's cardiomyopathy.

523
00:21:04,276 --> 00:21:05,320
I need to meet them
in the cath lab.

524
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:06,486
What about Elliott Calhoun?

525
00:21:06,573 --> 00:21:08,348
Alright, why don't you prep him?
Clear an O.R.

526
00:21:08,435 --> 00:21:09,598
I will go handle Schmitt,

527
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:10,928
and then I'll join you
when I can.

528
00:21:11,015 --> 00:21:12,727
Page me with any updates
on Parker.

529
00:21:16,703 --> 00:21:19,507
The rash is just
a little erythema toxicum, so...

530
00:21:19,595 --> 00:21:22,138
But it's not remarkable.
Nothing to worry about.

531
00:21:22,225 --> 00:21:24,045
So I think we can bring in
social services

532
00:21:24,133 --> 00:21:25,703
for his placement.

533
00:21:26,239 --> 00:21:27,304
Shh.

534
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:32,537
Maybe we can
wait for another couple of minutes.

535
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:34,015
What do you think?

536
00:21:35,177 --> 00:21:36,170
Do you have kids?

537
00:21:36,258 --> 00:21:38,266
Yes. Two.

538
00:21:38,488 --> 00:21:41,521
Boys. Teenagers.

539
00:21:41,616 --> 00:21:43,735
Hellions.

540
00:21:44,688 --> 00:21:46,951
- You?
- No. No, not yet.

541
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,279
I'm just volunteering.

542
00:21:48,367 --> 00:21:50,578
Oh, hello.

543
00:21:54,733 --> 00:21:57,657
I was in residency
when my boys were this age.

544
00:21:58,855 --> 00:22:01,058
All the pictures I have with
them, my eyes are half-closed.

545
00:22:02,793 --> 00:22:05,136
I love my boys,
but sometimes I think

546
00:22:05,224 --> 00:22:07,196
I probably missed
their perfect stage, you know?

547
00:22:07,289 --> 00:22:09,047
Yeah, he's pretty perfect.

548
00:22:09,173 --> 00:22:11,258
Don't know how you even
brought this guy in.

549
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,368
I think I would've
stolen him.

550
00:22:23,975 --> 00:22:26,360
The subcostal incision
isn't enough.

551
00:22:26,513 --> 00:22:28,975
Uh, can you visualize
the IVC?

552
00:22:29,063 --> 00:22:30,272
I can't see from my side.

553
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,397
Okay, we need
to extend up to a sternotomy

554
00:22:32,485 --> 00:22:33,805
to get better
visualization.

555
00:22:33,893 --> 00:22:35,686
Clamp the IVC
from all directions

556
00:22:35,774 --> 00:22:37,287
so I can isolate the bleed.

557
00:22:37,375 --> 00:22:38,844
You want to crack
her chest, too?

558
00:22:38,932 --> 00:22:40,631
No, but I don't want her
to die,

559
00:22:40,719 --> 00:22:42,735
and this is the only way
we can get control.

560
00:22:44,347 --> 00:22:46,027
You can do it
if you feel more comfortable.

561
00:22:46,613 --> 00:22:47,860
Scalpel.

562
00:22:51,195 --> 00:22:52,608
Get the saw ready.

563
00:23:12,225 --> 00:23:13,985
Okay.

564
00:23:31,914 --> 00:23:34,272
Very good alignment.

565
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,118
Dr. Hunt,
the E.R. is asking

566
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:37,869
if we can spare anyone
for an intake.

567
00:23:37,975 --> 00:23:39,078
Uh, Brody, we got this.

568
00:23:39,166 --> 00:23:40,195
But we haven't
closed the skin yet.

569
00:23:40,282 --> 00:23:42,852
Dr. Avery is perfectly capable
of doing it, so...

570
00:23:43,055 --> 00:23:44,094
Okay?

571
00:23:44,186 --> 00:23:46,024
Thanks, Brody.

572
00:23:46,311 --> 00:23:48,569
It's not her fault she didn't
know about you and Teddy.

573
00:23:53,292 --> 00:23:55,705
Listen,
I want to marry Teddy, okay?

574
00:23:55,793 --> 00:23:57,526
- It's just complicated.
- How's it complicated?

575
00:23:57,613 --> 00:23:59,836
- I'm afraid.
- That you'll screw the whole thing up?

576
00:23:59,924 --> 00:24:01,587
I am afraid
it won't be big enough

577
00:24:01,675 --> 00:24:04,297
to make up for the fact
that I didn't do this sooner.

578
00:24:04,385 --> 00:24:05,766
And I'm not talking about

579
00:24:06,798 --> 00:24:08,532
the months
since Allison's been here.

580
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:10,555
I'm talking about years,
decades.

581
00:24:10,643 --> 00:24:12,176
That is a lot of pressure.

582
00:24:12,264 --> 00:24:14,946
But pressure or not,
don't wait too long.

583
00:24:15,282 --> 00:24:17,468
If it's somebody you feel like
you want to be with forever,

584
00:24:17,555 --> 00:24:19,094
that should include now.

585
00:24:21,912 --> 00:24:24,615
What part of "updates
at every stage" was unclear?

586
00:24:24,703 --> 00:24:27,313
Well, you know how it is
when you're in the zone.

587
00:24:27,401 --> 00:24:30,602
Sometimes you just forget
everything else, right?

588
00:24:30,789 --> 00:24:32,532
Fractures are reduced.

589
00:24:32,845 --> 00:24:34,677
We're ready to reattach
the coronal flap.

590
00:24:34,765 --> 00:24:37,703
I mean, unless you want to check
my handiwork first.

591
00:24:37,791 --> 00:24:38,899
No need.

592
00:24:38,987 --> 00:24:40,438
Alright.
We're ready for closure.

593
00:24:40,531 --> 00:24:41,592
4-0 Vicryl, please.

594
00:24:42,612 --> 00:24:44,360
Whoa.
Wait, Avery.

595
00:24:44,585 --> 00:24:45,958
Koracick, look.

596
00:24:46,139 --> 00:24:48,758
There is clear fluid
around the blood. Look.

597
00:24:49,282 --> 00:24:51,532
CSF fluid's leaking
from his brain, damn it.

598
00:24:51,628 --> 00:24:53,218
- You said scans didn't indicate...
- Well, it doesn't matter now, does it?

599
00:24:53,305 --> 00:24:54,508
I got to find the leak
and seal it.

600
00:24:54,595 --> 00:24:55,805
I said updates every stage.

601
00:24:55,893 --> 00:24:57,509
If I hadn't shown up,
he'd be dead on your table.

602
00:24:57,596 --> 00:24:59,180
Suture scissors.

603
00:25:07,683 --> 00:25:10,032
Now, when I clamp
the intrapericardial IVC,

604
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,102
she'll flatline,

605
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:12,939
and then I have about a minute
to find the bleeding.

606
00:25:13,026 --> 00:25:14,532
You'll have
less than a minute.

607
00:25:16,055 --> 00:25:17,563
Alright, on my count.

608
00:25:17,852 --> 00:25:20,391
1, 2...

609
00:25:20,975 --> 00:25:22,008
3.

610
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:24,891
Starting cardiac massage.

611
00:25:24,986 --> 00:25:27,625
Oh, man, I still can't see it.
It's too much blood.

612
00:25:27,719 --> 00:25:28,836
Suction.

613
00:25:28,924 --> 00:25:31,087
Do not die.
Do you hear me?

614
00:25:31,218 --> 00:25:34,086
You are not dying.
You are not dying today.

615
00:25:34,185 --> 00:25:35,218
Okay.
I will not let you.

616
00:25:35,305 --> 00:25:36,305
No one is dying.

617
00:25:36,393 --> 00:25:38,412
Ah, okay. There, there, there.
I found it.

618
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,594
Okay. 6-0 Prolene.
Okay, Richard, seconds.

619
00:25:40,682 --> 00:25:42,647
Okay,
I'm repairing the IVC.

620
00:25:42,735 --> 00:25:43,755
Hold it.

621
00:25:43,968 --> 00:25:45,301
Richard.
Hold on.

622
00:25:45,435 --> 00:25:46,727
We're gonna lose her!

623
00:25:46,815 --> 00:25:47,995
Got it.
I'm releasing the clamp.

624
00:25:48,082 --> 00:25:49,191
Good.

625
00:25:50,973 --> 00:25:52,209
Okay.

626
00:25:53,043 --> 00:25:54,066
Okay.

627
00:25:54,154 --> 00:25:56,435
Come on, come on.

628
00:25:57,490 --> 00:25:58,526
Ah!

629
00:25:58,614 --> 00:25:59,646
Ah.

630
00:26:00,404 --> 00:26:01,816
She's back.

631
00:26:03,765 --> 00:26:05,207
- Great job, doctors.
- Alright.

632
00:26:05,295 --> 00:26:06,308
- Ah!
- Alright!

633
00:26:08,702 --> 00:26:12,285
Okay. Okay. Okay.

634
00:26:12,474 --> 00:26:14,662
You should so hate me
right now.

635
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:16,818
Schmitt, try and relax.

636
00:26:16,961 --> 00:26:20,857
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

637
00:26:21,011 --> 00:26:22,099
Schmitt!

638
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:24,998
I forgive you.

639
00:26:25,403 --> 00:26:27,597
I have my license.
I have my job.

640
00:26:27,685 --> 00:26:28,795
I forgive you.

641
00:26:28,883 --> 00:26:30,596
But I need you to be quiet
and stay still

642
00:26:30,715 --> 00:26:32,588
so Dr. Altman
can do her job.

643
00:26:32,761 --> 00:26:34,506
Okay.

644
00:26:36,366 --> 00:26:38,506
Dr. Altman, am I dying?

645
00:26:38,594 --> 00:26:40,467
No, it just felt like it.

646
00:26:40,555 --> 00:26:41,685
No blockages?

647
00:26:41,773 --> 00:26:43,476
No, he didn't have
a heart attack.

648
00:26:43,539 --> 00:26:45,717
It appears
from the echo and angio

649
00:26:45,805 --> 00:26:47,722
that he has
broken-heart syndrome.

650
00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:49,193
What's that?

651
00:26:49,281 --> 00:26:50,795
It's when you have the symptoms
of a heart attack...

652
00:26:50,882 --> 00:26:52,795
Chest pain,
shortness of breath...

653
00:26:52,984 --> 00:26:54,607
But there's nothing wrong.

654
00:26:54,842 --> 00:26:56,131
It's rare.

655
00:26:56,336 --> 00:26:58,287
Comes from extreme stress.

656
00:26:58,555 --> 00:27:01,170
No. Schmitt's as cool
as a cucumber.

657
00:27:01,317 --> 00:27:03,770
No, I'm not. I'm the most
stressed-out person...

658
00:27:04,287 --> 00:27:05,678
Oh, you're kidding.

659
00:27:05,765 --> 00:27:07,138
I'm kidding.

660
00:27:07,225 --> 00:27:08,428
Oh.

661
00:27:08,515 --> 00:27:10,015
I'm glad
you're okay.

but you're gonna be
just fine, buddy.

665
00:27:21,269 --> 00:27:23,842
You got people

But I...

680
00:28:00,789 --> 00:28:03,792
I fell a little bit in love
with him.

681
00:28:04,003 --> 00:28:05,583
Is that weird?

682
00:28:07,341 --> 00:28:08,998
Uh, you're asking
the wrong guy.

683
00:28:09,594 --> 00:28:11,767
I'm in love with a baby
that hasn't even been born yet.

684
00:28:14,422 --> 00:28:19,170
I went from being terrified
about being a father to...

685
00:28:19,702 --> 00:28:22,451
I'm just sunk.

686
00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:25,888
And, uh,
if this Safe Haven thing

687
00:28:25,975 --> 00:28:27,381

you are welcome to come hang

Helm's gonna be okay.

694
00:29:14,895 --> 00:29:17,982
You can tell her it was my call
to crack the chest.

695
00:29:19,615 --> 00:29:21,557
What about, uh, Simms?

696
00:29:21,645 --> 00:29:22,912
Linda said
they just closed,

697
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,654
and they are taking him up
to the ICU now.

698
00:29:26,451 --> 00:29:27,857
And Parker?

699
00:29:28,037 --> 00:29:29,080
They found him.

700
00:29:29,175 --> 00:29:30,840
Shepherd's been
monitoring him.

701
00:29:30,928 --> 00:29:32,279
She's optimistic,

702
00:29:32,621 --> 00:29:35,732
and, uh,
his recovery will take awhile.

703
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:39,293
Anyone figure out
what happened to Schmitt?

704
00:29:39,685 --> 00:29:41,649
Heartbreak syndrome,
apparently.

705
00:29:41,737 --> 00:29:43,567
He'll need
a few weeks rest.

706
00:29:46,083 --> 00:29:47,868
Bailey, everyone's fine.

707
00:29:50,475 --> 00:29:51,798
Everyone.

708
00:29:52,497 --> 00:29:54,095
Everyone.

709
00:29:56,384 --> 00:29:58,557
Everyone I touched today,

710
00:29:58,645 --> 00:30:02,907
everyone I held in my hands

711
00:30:03,298 --> 00:30:05,888
or gave
to another surgeon

712
00:30:05,975 --> 00:30:08,428
to put back
together again,

713
00:30:08,516 --> 00:30:10,298
and fine.

714
00:30:11,839 --> 00:30:15,000
I lose you and Grey,

715
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:18,524
Hunt, Karev,

716
00:30:18,855 --> 00:30:20,735
but I made that fine.

717
00:30:21,123 --> 00:30:23,532
I made that work.

718
00:30:26,428 --> 00:30:29,118
But this... this...

719
00:30:30,583 --> 00:30:33,930
This I...

720
00:30:35,805 --> 00:30:40,250
I am not fine.

721
00:30:42,935 --> 00:30:46,586
She isn't fine!

722
00:30:47,365 --> 00:30:51,860
And I can't even
hold her in my hands

723
00:30:53,508 --> 00:30:55,598
or put her
in someone else's hands

724
00:30:55,685 --> 00:30:57,308
who could put her
back together again.

725
00:30:57,395 --> 00:30:59,993
She just was!

726
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:01,735
Oh, God.

727
00:31:01,895 --> 00:31:04,594
And now she isn't.

728
00:31:04,781 --> 00:31:10,821
And I can't do anything
but just stand here...

729
00:31:12,358 --> 00:31:17,071
Stand here and lose her.

730
00:32:04,139 --> 00:32:05,342
Hey.

731
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:06,593
Hey.

732
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:08,327
My heart was broken.

733
00:32:10,078 --> 00:32:11,578
Mine too.

734
00:32:13,769 --> 00:32:15,342
Taryn's out of surgery.

735
00:32:15,898 --> 00:32:17,296
She's okay.

736
00:32:17,491 --> 00:32:19,864
- Can I go see her?
- Yeah.

737
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:21,952
In a minute.

738
00:32:37,592 --> 00:32:40,177
He did have facial fractures
we were able to fix,

739
00:32:40,265 --> 00:32:42,851
and then we discovered he had
fluid leaking from his brain,

740
00:32:42,939 --> 00:32:44,583
but Dr. Koracick
was able to get in there

741
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:45,968
and patch up the leak.

742
00:32:46,194 --> 00:32:48,046
Dr. Tommy
operated on him?

743
00:32:48,311 --> 00:32:49,807
Dr. Tommy is...?

744
00:32:49,895 --> 00:32:51,508
Tommy.
Koracick.

745
00:32:51,663 --> 00:32:53,038
- Oh.
- Oh.

746
00:32:53,474 --> 00:32:55,137
Yeah. Yes.

747
00:32:55,225 --> 00:32:56,530
Well, he's our angel.

748
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:58,554
When he offered Blake the job
to come out here,

749
00:32:58,642 --> 00:32:59,617
Blake said no.

750
00:32:59,705 --> 00:33:00,811
He didn't want
to leave me behind.

751
00:33:00,898 --> 00:33:02,530
It's...

752
00:33:02,618 --> 00:33:04,913
It's just been the two of us
since his parents died.

753
00:33:05,514 --> 00:33:07,778
But Dr. Tommy
wanted him badly enough

754
00:33:07,866 --> 00:33:09,638
he paid for me
to move to Seattle.

755
00:33:09,726 --> 00:33:12,148
I know he must be beating
himself up that this happened.

756
00:33:12,236 --> 00:33:14,702
I told him that it was
a freak accident,

757
00:33:15,109 --> 00:33:18,226
but you... you know
how emotional he is.

758
00:33:19,334 --> 00:33:20,538
- Koracick.
- Of course, yeah.

759
00:33:20,626 --> 00:33:22,999
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, s-super emotional guy.

760
00:33:23,087 --> 00:33:25,799
So, um,
will Blake be okay?

761
00:33:25,887 --> 00:33:27,749
There is
a slow recovery.

762
00:33:27,837 --> 00:33:30,077
His trach should come out
in a day or two.

763
00:33:30,293 --> 00:33:32,453
- As long as everything goes well...
- Lorraine?

764
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:34,179
Are these two men
bothering you?

765
00:33:34,267 --> 00:33:35,952
No, not at all.

766
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,677
Um, can I go
in the room?

767
00:33:37,765 --> 00:33:39,178
- Absolutely.
- Okay.

768
00:33:39,265 --> 00:33:41,268
Dr. Avery,
lead the way.

769
00:33:41,355 --> 00:33:42,765
Of course, yeah.

770
00:33:47,355 --> 00:33:49,046
- Hunt.
- Mm-hmm.

771
00:33:49,572 --> 00:33:52,163
That CSF leak,
that was a great catch.

772
00:33:52,395 --> 00:33:54,023
I'm grateful.

773
00:33:54,437 --> 00:33:55,819

Oh, my God, Owen.
What are you doing?

809
00:35:30,685 --> 00:35:32,439
Teddy.
What are you doing?

810
00:35:32,725 --> 00:35:34,290
This ring was my mom's.

811
00:35:36,438 --> 00:35:38,348
She gave it to me
the day that Allison was born,

812
00:35:38,436 --> 00:35:40,679
and I've been carrying it around
with me in my pocket

813
00:35:40,804 --> 00:35:42,220
ever since.

814
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:44,428
And I love you.

815
00:35:44,705 --> 00:35:46,244
And there's no
perfect moment,

816
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:48,193
and I am not
a perfect man,

817
00:35:48,295 --> 00:35:50,580
but the one thing
I know for sure is

818
00:35:52,036 --> 00:35:53,989
you're the perfect woman
for me.

819
00:35:54,194 --> 00:35:58,237
So, Theodora Grace Altman,
will you...

820
00:35:58,354 --> 00:36:00,345
Owen, no.

821
00:36:00,514 --> 00:36:01,717
- No?
- What?

822
00:36:01,805 --> 00:36:03,718
Is it Tom?

823
00:36:03,805 --> 00:36:04,932
Oh, my God, Teddy.

824
00:36:05,019 --> 00:36:07,842
Owen, stand up. Get up.
Listen to me.

825
00:36:07,930 --> 00:36:09,636
You are not obligated
to marry me.

826
00:36:09,724 --> 00:36:10,712
You don't have to do this.

827
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,831
I want you to break the
patterns, not reinforce them.

828
00:36:12,918 --> 00:36:14,478
I'm not repeating
a pattern.

829
00:36:16,355 --> 00:36:17,665
I'm starting a new one.

830
00:36:18,357 --> 00:36:19,845
Loving you,

831
00:36:21,145 --> 00:36:22,494
loving our family,

832
00:36:23,698 --> 00:36:27,132
with my whole heart,
every day.

833
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:28,728
That's my new pattern.

834
00:36:30,327 --> 00:36:32,167
I love you.

835
00:36:36,697 --> 00:36:38,480
I love you.

836
00:36:38,725 --> 00:36:40,058
Teddy, marry me.

837
00:36:40,345 --> 00:36:41,935
Marry me.

838
00:36:45,803 --> 00:36:47,501
Marry me, Teddy.

839
00:37:03,551 --> 00:37:04,834
Hi.
Hey.

840
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:06,923
Uh, I have
to tell you something,

841
00:37:07,351 --> 00:37:09,033
um, and I'm sorry
to do it at work.

842
00:37:09,121 --> 00:37:11,845
I... It deserves
dinner and privacy,

843
00:37:11,933 --> 00:37:13,097
but if I don't
spit it out...

844
00:37:13,185 --> 00:37:14,580
Oh, it's okay.
What is it?

845
00:37:15,861 --> 00:37:16,822

846
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:18,751

00:38:48,606 --> 00:38:52,900

I'm done for.

I told Meredith Grey
I loved her.

887
00:39:05,015 --> 00:39:06,853
You did.
I heard.

888
00:39:07,455 --> 00:39:11,098
She didn't say it back,
did she?

889
00:39:11,186 --> 00:39:13,432
No.

890
00:39:13,585 --> 00:39:15,916
But you will find someone.
I promise.

891
00:39:16,055 --> 00:39:18,033
Yeah,
it's easy for you to say.

892
00:39:18,121 --> 00:39:20,119
You get to make out with that
every night.

893
00:39:20,228 --> 00:39:23,642
Yeah. But it took me
my whole life to find him.

894
00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:25,603
And, also,
for what it's worth,

895
00:39:25,698 --> 00:39:29,947
I am amazing,
but I am no Meredith Grey.

896
00:39:30,689 --> 00:39:32,597

Alright, I-I'm coming.

903
00:39:59,238 --> 00:40:01,151
Hey. I turned off my
phone for a reason.

904
00:40:01,355 --> 00:40:02,388
Okay, hey, hey, hey.

905
00:40:02,475 --> 00:40:05,673
Elliott Calhoun's heart
started beating again.

906
00:40:08,355 --> 00:40:10,752
Yeah. You did that.

907
00:40:11,184 --> 00:40:12,627
You saved him.

908
00:40:12,996 --> 00:40:15,877
Oh, God. Thank you.
Thank you, um...

909
00:40:16,375 --> 00:40:18,970
Thank you for telling me.
I needed to hear that.

910
00:40:19,911 --> 00:40:23,330
Hey, c-can I...
Could we, um, talk?

911
00:40:23,719 --> 00:40:25,111
Yeah.

912
00:40:26,595 --> 00:40:28,867
Look, I blew it, I think.

913
00:40:28,955 --> 00:40:30,126
I think I made a big mistake
with Meredith.

914
00:40:30,213 --> 00:40:31,812
I asked her
to take time.

915
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:33,845
I don't know. I...

916
00:40:34,015 --> 00:40:35,348
I meant
some of what I said.

917
00:40:35,435 --> 00:40:37,179
I-I-I wanted her
to see me.

918
00:40:37,267 --> 00:40:39,008
I wanted to know
she respected me.

919
00:40:39,095 --> 00:40:42,428
But I think
asking her to take time

920
00:40:42,515 --> 00:40:44,098
might've had
the opposite effect.

921
00:40:44,197 --> 00:40:45,210
You hurt someone

922
00:40:45,298 --> 00:40:47,507
who's had more than enough hurt
for a lifetime.

923
00:40:47,595 --> 00:40:49,705
I know. And I don't know
how to undo it.

924
00:40:51,294 --> 00:40:52,674
Dr. Margaret Pierce?

925
00:40:52,773 --> 00:40:54,166
Yeah?

926
00:40:54,531 --> 00:40:55,885
You've been served.

927
00:40:58,438 --> 00:41:01,731
<i>That's why depression,
fatigue, and burnout</i>

928
00:41:01,904 --> 00:41:03,822
<i>are so common
in our profession.</i>

929
00:41:05,375 --> 00:41:07,275
I'm being sued
for wrongful death.

930
00:41:09,185 --> 00:41:10,611
Who's Sabrina Webber?

931
00:41:13,395 --> 00:41:15,205
My cousin.

932
00:41:23,843 --> 00:41:26,470
<i>But if you're going to make
a life of this,</i>

933
00:41:26,867 --> 00:41:29,728
<i>you need to learn to rely on
others whenever possible.</i>

934
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:32,513
<i>Get in here.</i>

935
00:41:42,567 --> 00:41:44,440
I had a miscarriage once.

936
00:41:44,838 --> 00:41:46,127
I never felt so lonely.

937
00:41:56,547 --> 00:41:58,595
Well, did... did you bring me the
doughnuts?

938
00:41:58,682 --> 00:41:59,807
Did you bring...

939
00:41:59,894 --> 00:42:01,431
<i>And that if you break,</i>

940
00:42:01,708 --> 00:42:04,463
it's okay to let your friends
put you back together.
