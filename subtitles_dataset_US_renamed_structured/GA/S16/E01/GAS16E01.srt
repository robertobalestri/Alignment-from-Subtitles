No, no, i-it's Jackson.

- He's down there. I don't know
- Okay. Okay,

29
00:01:23,626 --> 00:01:24,336
- what happened.
- You stay on the road.

30
00:01:24,424 --> 00:01:25,545
Grab the climbing gear!

31
00:01:25,633 --> 00:01:26,860

Down here!

35
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:35,781
They were climbing.
Give me your hand.

36
00:01:35,868 --> 00:01:37,710
- He fell, and I caught the rope.
- I took over,

37
00:01:37,797 --> 00:01:39,304
but he's dead weight.
I got no leverage here.

38
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:40,623
- Is he alive?
- I don't know.

39
00:01:40,711 --> 00:01:42,233
He has to be.
He has to be.

40
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:48,239
Alright. Uh...
Tie him to an anchor point.

00:01:48,327 --> 00:01:49,655
I'm gonna attach a Prusik.

00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:51,866

00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,613
Alright.

44
00:01:54,225 --> 00:01:55,710
Let's go.

45
00:01:56,326 --> 00:01:58,380
Alright.
Alright, dig your heels in.

46
00:01:58,468 --> 00:01:59,501
We're gonna pull.
Ready?

47
00:01:59,588 --> 00:02:00,831
- Yeah.
- Pull!

48
00:02:00,918 --> 00:02:02,591
- Go.
- Good, good, good. Pull.

49
00:02:02,678 --> 00:02:04,293
Keep pulling.

50
00:02:05,304 --> 00:02:07,508
- Go!
- Pull!

51
00:02:10,126 --> 00:02:12,077
And the person
who I trained,

52
00:02:12,425 --> 00:02:15,764
the person I mentored,
fired me.

53
00:02:16,445 --> 00:02:19,108
Without a word of apology
or regret.

54
00:02:19,398 --> 00:02:23,217
And my own wife said nothing
to defend me,

55
00:02:23,305 --> 00:02:24,694
not one word.

56
00:02:26,225 --> 00:02:28,514
Look, I-I-I know
I have my part in this,

57
00:02:28,602 --> 00:02:30,859
but I do not see me

58
00:02:30,947 --> 00:02:34,967
forgiving anyone but myself
anytime soon.

59
00:02:37,552 --> 00:02:38,967
I did it myself.

60
00:02:39,946 --> 00:02:42,209
I take full responsibility
for my actions.

61
00:02:42,297 --> 00:02:44,736
Andrew DeLuca had absolutely
nothing to do with it.

62
00:02:45,001 --> 00:02:46,311
Okay.

63
00:02:47,203 --> 00:02:49,616
Okay.
What now?

64
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:51,420
We go to the police?

65
00:02:51,678 --> 00:02:53,913
No. Now you go home
and I do what I do.

66
00:02:54,147 --> 00:02:55,553
I go home?

67
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,038
Will they
let Andrew out?

68
00:02:57,126 --> 00:02:58,812
After the charges against him
are dismissed.

69
00:02:58,899 --> 00:02:59,942
And then what?

70
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,343
Well, we'll schedule
a hearing.

71
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:03,514
You'll be
deeply repentant.

72
00:03:03,647 --> 00:03:05,715
You'll get a few weeks
of community service

73
00:03:05,803 --> 00:03:07,084
at a free clinic,

74
00:03:07,172 --> 00:03:08,255
and you'll pay a fine.

75
00:03:08,343 --> 00:03:09,453
And what about
my medical license?

76
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,419
That's up to the board
if they want to pursue action,

77
00:03:11,507 --> 00:03:13,483
but I'd say
it's highly unlikely.

78
00:03:14,585 --> 00:03:16,522
So I just go home.
Yes.

79
00:03:17,177 --> 00:03:18,420
- Is there a problem?
- No.

80
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,301
I just... I did
this long, dramatic goodbye

81
00:03:21,389 --> 00:03:22,959
with my kids.

82
00:03:23,509 --> 00:03:24,593
Well,
this is good, man.

83
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,178
This is a good thing.

84
00:03:26,357 --> 00:03:28,311
She's getting
the help she needs.

85
00:03:28,947 --> 00:03:30,200
Yeah, well,
it's just...

86
00:03:30,451 --> 00:03:32,084
I have a history
with some people

87
00:03:32,172 --> 00:03:33,701
who had that kind of help,
and it doesn't help.

88
00:03:33,789 --> 00:03:35,764
Jo's not those people,

89
00:03:35,937 --> 00:03:36,810
and she isn't
just a fighter.

90
00:03:36,897 --> 00:03:40,147
She's Rocky.
She's Ali.

91
00:03:40,623 --> 00:03:41,873
She'll get better.

92
00:03:43,147 --> 00:03:44,850
Let's talk about
something else.

93
00:03:46,678 --> 00:03:48,171
I think
Amelia dumped me.

94
00:03:48,499 --> 00:03:49,905
You think?

95
00:03:50,607 --> 00:03:52,100
Little hard to tell.

96
00:03:56,327 --> 00:03:57,560
Hi.

97
00:03:57,708 --> 00:04:01,270
Somebody wants to meet
his baby sister.

98
00:04:01,358 --> 00:04:02,246
Leo, Leo.
Look, look.

99
00:04:02,334 --> 00:04:04,230
This is your little sister,
Allison,

100
00:04:04,317 --> 00:04:08,690
and, Allison, this is your
big brother, Leo.

101
00:04:08,897 --> 00:04:12,286
Leo, being a big
brother is such an important job.

102
00:04:12,374 --> 00:04:15,190
Oh, uh, Hunt, Shepherd,
I have incoming trauma.

103
00:04:15,277 --> 00:04:16,270
Well,
I just had a baby.

104
00:04:16,358 --> 00:04:17,131
- He just had a baby.
- Yeah.

105
00:04:17,219 --> 00:04:20,059
I'm aware. She's very cute.
Congratulations.

106
00:04:20,146 --> 00:04:22,233
I still need you to come.
Altman, you're excused.

107
00:04:22,321 --> 00:04:23,827
What...
Are you serious?

108
00:04:23,977 --> 00:04:27,270
Due to criminal activity,
Meredith Grey,

109
00:04:27,357 --> 00:04:29,390
Alex Karev, and Richard Webber
no longer work here.

110
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:30,397
What?

111
00:04:30,485 --> 00:04:31,835
And Andrew DeLuca's
in jail.

112
00:04:31,923 --> 00:04:33,379
What do you mean
"criminal activity"?

113
00:04:33,467 --> 00:04:34,998
- Incoming trauma.
- Now.

114
00:04:35,147 --> 00:04:36,650
What do you mean
"criminal activi..."

115
00:04:36,887 --> 00:04:37,933
Would you?

116
00:04:38,029 --> 00:04:39,649
Oh. Oh, yeah.
Uh, sure.

117
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:41,060
Hey. Hi. Okay.

118
00:04:41,147 --> 00:04:43,436
Oh. Oh, boy.
Okay, okay, yeah.

119
00:04:43,524 --> 00:04:45,099
Okay. Hi. Oh.

120
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:46,889
- Bye. We gotta go.
- Okay. Yeah. Goodbye.

121
00:04:46,977 --> 00:04:49,060
Okay. Okay.
Okay. I know.

122
00:04:50,357 --> 00:04:52,006
Oh, I...

123
00:04:52,317 --> 00:04:53,936
Hey, help.

124
00:04:54,237 --> 00:04:55,480
Nurse?

125
00:04:55,567 --> 00:04:56,770
Let's see. Look at this.
What's this? Wh...

126
00:04:56,857 --> 00:04:58,809
You...
You had the baby!

127
00:05:00,772 --> 00:05:03,060
I-I tried to reach you.
I-I didn't hear from you.

128
00:05:03,147 --> 00:05:05,577
And then I had the...
The Spidey Sense, and...

129
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:07,810
Oh.

130
00:05:07,898 --> 00:05:09,991
Look at her.

131
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:11,272
Wow.

132
00:05:11,367 --> 00:05:12,830
What a beauty.

133
00:05:12,918 --> 00:05:16,045
And that is little Leo Hunt,
am I right?

134
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:17,940
You must be so tired.
You need a hand?

135
00:05:18,027 --> 00:05:19,690
Come here,
little Leo Hunt.

136
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:20,842
Come here.

137
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:22,600
Wait, so, tell me... What...

138
00:05:22,687 --> 00:05:25,473
So, tell me... did she get
back together with your daddy?

139
00:05:25,561 --> 00:05:26,520
Is that what she did?

140
00:05:26,607 --> 00:05:27,940
Yes, she did,
didn't she?

141
00:05:28,027 --> 00:05:29,850
Did he ride in
on a white horse

142
00:05:29,937 --> 00:05:32,100
and make
all the right promises?

143
00:05:32,187 --> 00:05:33,650
I think he did. Yes, I do.
That's what I think.

144
00:05:33,737 --> 00:05:35,650
Oh, Tom, please don't...
Don't... don't blame Owen.

145
00:05:35,737 --> 00:05:38,153
This is... This is me.
This is... It's my fault.

146
00:05:38,241 --> 00:05:39,850
I'm just...
You know, you are...

147
00:05:39,945 --> 00:05:42,981
You are
such a wonderful man.

148
00:05:43,069 --> 00:05:44,248
Oh... Oh, I know I am.

149
00:05:44,335 --> 00:05:46,770
I'm funny and I'm smart
and I'm kind when I want to be,

150
00:05:46,857 --> 00:05:48,810
generous with my money
and with my tongue in bed.

151
00:05:48,897 --> 00:05:50,270
So, you will regret
this decision,

152
00:05:50,357 --> 00:05:51,880
and when you do...

153
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,129
I'll still be here

154
00:05:54,217 --> 00:05:57,390
because, uh,
I'm in love with you,

155
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:00,150
and I don't think this thing
with Hunt's gonna last.

156
00:06:00,335 --> 00:06:03,020
And in the meantime,
we are friends.

157
00:06:03,326 --> 00:06:04,729
- Okay?
- Ma.

158
00:06:04,817 --> 00:06:07,380
Yeah, do you want me to take
little Leo back to daycare?

159
00:06:07,481 --> 00:06:09,112
Yes, please.
Yeah?

160
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,480
He's crazy about me.

161
00:06:10,567 --> 00:06:12,350
Come on, little Leo.

162
00:06:12,437 --> 00:06:14,310
Let's go back to daycare,
you and me.

163
00:06:16,567 --> 00:06:17,669
You fired them?

164
00:06:17,757 --> 00:06:19,493
What do you suggest
I should have done?

165
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,033
Anything
but fire them.

166
00:06:23,054 --> 00:06:25,007
Mari Prishna, 34,

open right humerus fracture

168
00:06:27,716 --> 00:06:29,089
Okay.
Page Lincoln and Kim.

169
00:06:33,477 --> 00:06:34,614
What do we got?

170
00:06:34,732 --> 00:06:38,614
Jai Prishna, 35, GCS 11,
with a left open femur fracture

171
00:06:38,734 --> 00:06:40,157
and right
lower leg deformity,

172
00:06:40,245 --> 00:06:41,818
secondary to a fall
over a cliff,

173
00:06:41,937 --> 00:06:42,731
thready pulse.

174
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:44,229
Systolic's in the hundreds.
Okay.

175
00:06:44,317 --> 00:06:45,560
Uh...

176
00:06:45,647 --> 00:06:47,350
Uh,
you two hurt, or...?

177
00:06:47,437 --> 00:06:48,690
No.
No.

178
00:06:48,777 --> 00:06:50,107
We're fine.
We're fine.

179
00:06:54,734 --> 00:06:56,734
<font color=#FF00FF>*GREY"S ANATOMY*</font>

<font color=#FF00FF>*GREY"S ANATOMY*</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Episode Title: </font><font color=#FFFF00>"Nothing Left to Cling To"</font>

181
00:07:05,076 --> 00:07:06,409
And we're good to go.

182
00:07:06,607 --> 00:07:09,674
He wanted to cut off my leg.
I didn't want to,

183
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:12,424
I suggested that it was
the safest course of action.

184
00:07:12,512 --> 00:07:13,824
- But then you were wrong.
- But then

185
00:07:13,911 --> 00:07:15,778
I was a miracle worker.

186
00:07:15,903 --> 00:07:17,764
After he begged you
and cried.

187
00:07:17,852 --> 00:07:20,244
You love me because
I'm a sensitive guy.

188
00:07:21,264 --> 00:07:23,230
Alright, can we let our interns
do their job now, please?

189
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:24,090
Qadri?

190
00:07:24,178 --> 00:07:26,299
Mari Prishna, 34,
seven days post-op

191
00:07:26,387 --> 00:07:28,440
after she was
a warrior goddess

192
00:07:28,527 --> 00:07:29,890
and saved
her husband's life.

193
00:07:29,977 --> 00:07:31,723
Dr. Avery
was the warrior.

194
00:07:32,187 --> 00:07:33,100
He saved Jai.

195
00:07:33,187 --> 00:07:35,018
I mean,
if he hadn't come along...

196
00:07:35,106 --> 00:07:36,980
No, Mari,
you caught the rope,

197
00:07:37,067 --> 00:07:40,650
and you held it for hours
on a broken, shredded arm.

198
00:07:40,832 --> 00:07:42,247
You saved his life.

199
00:07:42,521 --> 00:07:44,528
We did a debridement
of her wound

200
00:07:44,616 --> 00:07:46,481
and then put in
a right humeral plate.

201
00:07:46,569 --> 00:07:49,059
So, today will be
her brachial plexus surgery

202
00:07:49,147 --> 00:07:50,977
for definitive
nerve repair.

203
00:07:53,816 --> 00:07:55,889
Uh, I'm checking in my wife...
Josephine Karev.

204
00:07:55,977 --> 00:07:57,169
You need
to drive around.

205
00:07:57,256 --> 00:07:59,629
You say goodbye there,
she goes in on foot.

206
00:08:16,533 --> 00:08:18,439
I hate
that I did this to you.

207
00:08:18,527 --> 00:08:19,650
Did what?

208
00:08:19,737 --> 00:08:21,416
- Became another name
- Yeah.

209
00:08:21,504 --> 00:08:23,575
On your list
of crazy women.

210
00:08:23,936 --> 00:08:27,043
Listen, for the record,
you are way saner

211
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:28,582
than any woman
I've ever dropped off

212
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:30,465
at a treatment center.

213
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,707
Look,
it's 30 days.

214
00:08:33,795 --> 00:08:36,676
You go in, you talk about
your feelings or whatever,

215
00:08:37,215 --> 00:08:39,465
and I get to come visit you
on Saturdays.

216
00:08:39,739 --> 00:08:41,107
You don't have to.

217
00:08:42,506 --> 00:08:44,190
Alex, we're not even
legally married.

218
00:08:44,278 --> 00:08:45,883
We never filed
a license.

219
00:08:45,971 --> 00:08:47,283
You have an out,

220
00:08:48,017 --> 00:08:50,768
and I guess I'm saying
that I love you enough

221
00:08:50,896 --> 00:08:52,815
to understand
if you want to take it.

222
00:09:25,364 --> 00:09:26,947
Bipolars, please.

223
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,330
Look at
the posterior cord.

224
00:09:29,437 --> 00:09:30,766
I have no idea

225
00:09:30,854 --> 00:09:33,424
how she hung onto her husband
for that many hours.

226
00:09:33,512 --> 00:09:35,516
I'm thinking
I would have let go

227
00:09:35,604 --> 00:09:38,677
at about the 20-minute mark,
if not sooner.

228
00:09:38,822 --> 00:09:40,463
Sounds about right.

229
00:09:40,684 --> 00:09:44,197
Okay, so, clearly,
we have had a misunderstanding.

230
00:09:44,514 --> 00:09:46,125
Can we talk
after surgery?

231
00:09:46,213 --> 00:09:47,346
I'm happy
to talk now.

232
00:09:47,434 --> 00:09:48,347
I'm not
listening.

233
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,901
And I don't
care.

234
00:09:51,205 --> 00:09:53,533
I like you...
a lot.

235
00:09:53,825 --> 00:09:55,596
I would like
to keep seeing you.

236
00:09:55,684 --> 00:09:59,049
What I don't want to do
is bury myself in you.

237
00:09:59,607 --> 00:10:00,520
You know
what I mean?

238
00:10:00,608 --> 00:10:01,981
No,
he doesn't.

239
00:10:02,176 --> 00:10:04,299
He doesn't?
You don't?

240
00:10:04,387 --> 00:10:05,953
Of course he doesn't. You're not
speaking in a language

241
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,682
any dude could possibly understand.
They're not wrong.

242
00:10:10,314 --> 00:10:12,776
I would like
to go on dates with you

243
00:10:12,864 --> 00:10:16,359
and get to know you better
before I'm all in,

244
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:20,057
because I have a history
of going all in too fast,

245
00:10:20,144 --> 00:10:21,760
and I would like
to change that.

246
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:23,886
Better?

247
00:10:24,104 --> 00:10:25,467
- Better.
- Better.

248
00:10:25,932 --> 00:10:27,533
Better.

249
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:40,727
Can you
come back later, please?

250
00:10:40,814 --> 00:10:42,847
Okay.

251
00:10:44,054 --> 00:10:45,245
She won't stop crying.
She just...

252
00:10:45,332 --> 00:10:46,635
She won't stop crying!

253
00:10:46,723 --> 00:10:50,016
Alright, Teddy, listen.
This... This is crazy.

254
00:10:50,104 --> 00:10:51,677
- Just come home with me.
- No.

255
00:10:51,764 --> 00:10:53,674
No, I am not
going back home

256
00:10:53,762 --> 00:10:55,406
to the house
that you bought for Amelia.

257
00:10:55,494 --> 00:10:56,985
That's not the way
you and I are supposed to

258
00:10:57,072 --> 00:10:58,177
start our lives
together.

259
00:10:58,264 --> 00:11:00,315
I know it.
I know it in my soul.

260
00:11:00,403 --> 00:11:03,690
What, and this hotel room...
This makes sense to your soul?

261
00:11:03,854 --> 00:11:06,688
My soul
needs a shower,

262
00:11:06,776 --> 00:11:09,727
and our baby
needs a diaper change.

263
00:11:10,821 --> 00:11:12,210
Okay.

264
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:13,814
Thank you.

265
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:22,727
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

266
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:31,820
Uh, hello,
I'm, uh, I'm Dr. Webber...

267
00:11:31,908 --> 00:11:33,971
From the health app?
Oh, please, come in.

268
00:11:34,059 --> 00:11:35,222
Okay.

269
00:11:39,054 --> 00:11:40,227
Dumbledore.

270
00:11:40,314 --> 00:11:42,216
Dumbledore, stop that.
Stop it.

271
00:11:42,304 --> 00:11:43,866
Stop that. Stop that.

272
00:11:44,724 --> 00:11:46,057
Sorry about that.
Yeah.

273
00:11:46,237 --> 00:11:48,727
This is Lolly.
Hi, honey.

274
00:11:48,814 --> 00:11:50,427
So, she's got a fever

275
00:11:50,514 --> 00:11:52,307
and a headache
and a sore throat,

276
00:11:52,394 --> 00:11:54,033
and this morning,
we were at the park,

277
00:11:54,143 --> 00:11:55,097
and we were playing.

278
00:11:55,184 --> 00:11:56,887
I'm not really...
sure what happened.

279
00:11:56,974 --> 00:11:59,354
She seemed fine.

280
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,967
Oh, my God.

281
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:03,977
Well... I guess maybe
she has the flu.

282
00:12:04,065 --> 00:12:04,887
I...

283
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:07,767
I'd say maybe.

284
00:12:16,979 --> 00:12:18,267
Hey.

285
00:12:18,682 --> 00:12:20,641
Shepherd was able to do
a complete repair

286
00:12:20,729 --> 00:12:21,807
of Mari's nerves.

287
00:12:21,894 --> 00:12:23,252
That's good.
That's good.

288
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,543
How's Jai?

289
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,383
He's improving,
actually.

290
00:12:27,604 --> 00:12:29,033
How's that ankle?

291
00:12:29,814 --> 00:12:31,026
It's a little better.

292
00:12:31,114 --> 00:12:32,214
Good.

293
00:12:32,302 --> 00:12:34,175
How about us?
How are we?

294
00:12:34,354 --> 00:12:35,517
Hmm?

295
00:12:35,604 --> 00:12:37,467
It's been a week,
Maggie.

296
00:12:37,854 --> 00:12:39,097
We agreed...

297
00:12:39,184 --> 00:12:41,307
To let
our tempers settle

298
00:12:41,394 --> 00:12:42,846
before we talked further
about...

299
00:12:42,934 --> 00:12:45,346
You abandoning me
on a dark and foggy road?

300
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,103
That walk that I took...

301
00:12:48,191 --> 00:12:49,886
- That walk you took?
- ..ending up saving two lives.

302
00:12:49,973 --> 00:12:52,463
Is that what we're calling it
now? That walk you took?

303
00:12:52,551 --> 00:12:55,084
You left me
in a car

304
00:12:55,324 --> 00:12:57,705
on an unfamiliar road
i-in the woods,

305
00:12:57,838 --> 00:12:59,306
surrounded by...

306
00:12:59,394 --> 00:13:01,440
fog and bears
and wolves.

307
00:13:01,528 --> 00:13:03,260
There were no bears.
Why...

308
00:13:03,348 --> 00:13:05,468
None that we could see,
but I could hear them!

309
00:13:08,224 --> 00:13:10,315
This is why
we should wait to talk.

310
00:13:10,403 --> 00:13:12,002
Yeah, got it.

311
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:16,494
Dr. Grey's bleeding heart
got the better of her,

312
00:13:16,591 --> 00:13:19,004
but she is
an award-winning surgeon.

313
00:13:19,224 --> 00:13:21,188
She saves lives every day,
and she...

314
00:13:21,276 --> 00:13:22,953
Did you bring an actual violin,
counselor?

315
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:24,461
- Judge...
- Dr. Grey,

316
00:13:24,557 --> 00:13:26,959
you're a partial owner of
Grey-Sloan Memorial.

317
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:28,846
So why commit
insurance fraud?

318
00:13:28,934 --> 00:13:31,197
Why not just pay
for the surgery yourself

319
00:13:31,314 --> 00:13:32,463
or do it for free?

320
00:13:32,634 --> 00:13:34,021
Repentant.

321
00:13:34,987 --> 00:13:37,520
Your Honor,
the little girl has cancer.

322
00:13:37,849 --> 00:13:41,392
She needs hundreds of thousands
of dollars' worth of care

323
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,080
over a period
of years,

324
00:13:43,168 --> 00:13:46,713
and I didn't think that her
very proud, hardworking father

325
00:13:46,801 --> 00:13:48,729
would accept charity
from me.

326
00:13:48,949 --> 00:13:51,112
And I didn't think
he should have to.

327
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:53,283
The system
should've supported them,

328
00:13:53,385 --> 00:13:55,048
and the system
is broken.

329
00:13:55,174 --> 00:13:56,908
Do you regret
your choices?

330
00:14:03,963 --> 00:14:05,869
To the extent
that I can,

331
00:14:05,957 --> 00:14:08,151
knowing there's a very sick
little girl out there,

332
00:14:08,256 --> 00:14:10,298
- who's beginning to feel better.
- Your Honor...

333
00:14:10,385 --> 00:14:11,174
I've heard enough!

334
00:14:11,262 --> 00:14:12,580
She has three kids.

335
00:14:12,729 --> 00:14:14,387
Don't throw her
in jail.

336
00:14:24,372 --> 00:14:25,899
Help!
Somebody help my husband!

337
00:14:25,987 --> 00:14:27,227
Help! Help!

338
00:14:27,314 --> 00:14:29,135
Help, help!
Somebody help me! Help!

339
00:14:29,247 --> 00:14:31,161
We were just talking, then he started
acting strange... - Call in a code.

340
00:14:31,248 --> 00:14:33,167
...and he stopped talking,
and I can't wake him up. Jai!

341
00:14:33,254 --> 00:14:34,409
- I got a pulse.
- Jai, please wake up.

342
00:14:34,496 --> 00:14:35,322
Rapid response.
Wake up. Jai.

343
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:36,916
- Crash cart and intubation tray!
- Jai.

344
00:14:37,003 --> 00:14:37,690
I'm on it.
Give me the mask.

345
00:14:37,778 --> 00:14:38,742
Wake up.
Please wake up.

346
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:39,565
- Jai.
- 100% oxygen.

347
00:14:39,653 --> 00:14:40,887
- Pushing saline.
- Please wake up!

348
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:42,033
Please wake up, Jai.

349
00:14:44,644 --> 00:14:47,234
You put Tom Koracick
in charge of me.

350
00:14:47,322 --> 00:14:48,467
I put him in charge

351
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:51,289
of all Catherine Fox Foundation
hospitals.

352
00:14:51,377 --> 00:14:52,195
He's Chief of Chiefs.

353
00:14:52,283 --> 00:14:53,427
You said
you would have my back.

354
00:14:53,514 --> 00:14:54,565
I did
have your back.

355
00:14:54,653 --> 00:14:57,651
I sat here silently
while you fired my husband

356
00:14:57,739 --> 00:14:59,902
and two of your most effective
department heads.

357
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:02,221
Because they had
broken the law!

358
00:15:02,309 --> 00:15:04,562
When I was 15,
I stole a lipstick

359
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:06,313
just to see
if I could get away with it.

360
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:07,549
Do you think
that means

361
00:15:07,637 --> 00:15:09,415
I shouldn't
get to practice medicine?

362
00:15:10,017 --> 00:15:12,416
What? That's a false
equivalence, and you know it!

363
00:15:12,504 --> 00:15:15,047
My husband
is working for an app!

364
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:19,346
He's making house calls
like it's 1965.

365
00:15:20,771 --> 00:15:22,354
He leaves the house
before I wake,

366
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:24,510
he goes to sleep at night
before I get home,

367
00:15:24,598 --> 00:15:26,841
and if our paths happen to cross
in the daytime,

368
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,276
he avoids eye contact.

369
00:15:29,527 --> 00:15:32,270
That's what
standing by you cost me...

370
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:33,806
My marriage.

371
00:15:34,619 --> 00:15:37,252
So Tom Koracick
is my punishment.

372
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:38,963
I am living
with cancer.

373
00:15:39,214 --> 00:15:40,957
I don't have the energy
I once did.

374
00:15:41,216 --> 00:15:42,677
And all the things
you used to bring to me,

375
00:15:42,764 --> 00:15:43,862
you will now
bring to Tom.

376
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:46,400
- Tom is a world-class surgeon
- ..I know what he is.

377
00:15:54,535 --> 00:15:55,807
DeLuca?

378
00:15:56,934 --> 00:15:58,799
You want
to explain yourself?

379
00:15:58,887 --> 00:16:00,463
Yeah, you fired
several doctors,

380
00:16:00,553 --> 00:16:02,854
and other doctors quit
in solidarity.

381
00:16:03,185 --> 00:16:04,893
But I've been cleared
of all my charges,

382
00:16:04,981 --> 00:16:06,361
and I think
you might need my help.

383
00:16:08,394 --> 00:16:09,596
Cocky.

384
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,213
DeLuca.

385
00:16:11,394 --> 00:16:13,967
This...
This is cocky.

386
00:16:14,054 --> 00:16:15,467
You want me to leave?

387
00:16:15,554 --> 00:16:16,729
I can leave.

388
00:16:16,817 --> 00:16:18,730
Just get to work.

389
00:16:25,385 --> 00:16:26,768
You really a doctor?

390
00:16:27,197 --> 00:16:28,407
I might be.

391
00:16:28,495 --> 00:16:30,118
It's still undecided.

392
00:16:30,314 --> 00:16:31,580
What did you do?

393
00:16:31,935 --> 00:16:33,188
Robbed a bank.

394
00:16:33,314 --> 00:16:34,387
Really?

395
00:16:34,474 --> 00:16:35,557
No.

396
00:16:35,644 --> 00:16:37,055
I keyed
my ex-boyfriend's car.

397
00:16:37,143 --> 00:16:38,008
Oh.

398
00:16:38,096 --> 00:16:39,047
Did he deserve it?

399
00:16:39,135 --> 00:16:40,932
Oh,
he very much did.

400
00:16:41,814 --> 00:16:44,455
So,
I got this mole.

401
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:46,221
Think you could
take a look?

402
00:16:52,025 --> 00:16:53,148
Heard about Jai.

403
00:16:53,236 --> 00:16:56,744
Yeah, radiology says
he has watershed infarcts,

404
00:16:56,832 --> 00:16:58,205
which makes no sense
in this case.

405
00:16:58,293 --> 00:16:59,846
He's 35,
he could do an Ironman,

406
00:16:59,934 --> 00:17:01,096
and he just
strokes out.

407
00:17:01,184 --> 00:17:03,487
- Out of nowhere.
- Did you do an echo or a V/Q?

408
00:17:03,575 --> 00:17:05,488
Of course I did,
Maggie.

409
00:17:05,684 --> 00:17:06,932
I...

410
00:17:07,418 --> 00:17:08,708
I'm trying to help.

411
00:17:09,915 --> 00:17:13,136
Jai was hanging on the edge of
a cliff with two shattered legs,

412
00:17:13,224 --> 00:17:15,112
and Mari hung onto him.

413
00:17:16,432 --> 00:17:17,651
She hung on so hard

414
00:17:17,739 --> 00:17:19,556
that a tree sliced through
the nerves in her arm

415
00:17:19,643 --> 00:17:21,127
and almost cut it off.

416
00:17:21,388 --> 00:17:22,641
But she hung on,

417
00:17:23,158 --> 00:17:24,979
pulled him
from the brink,

418
00:17:25,189 --> 00:17:27,119
like the edge of
certain death.

419
00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:29,556
And then we show up
and we bring him back here

420
00:17:29,644 --> 00:17:31,387
and we put him through
excruciating surgeries,

421
00:17:31,474 --> 00:17:34,799
and now he's on...
life support,

422
00:17:35,482 --> 00:17:37,994
somewhere between
alive and dead.

423
00:17:38,421 --> 00:17:41,158
So, I'm wondering
if she should have...

424
00:17:42,408 --> 00:17:43,487
back at
that cliffside,

425
00:17:43,575 --> 00:17:44,963
if she should have
just...

426
00:17:45,893 --> 00:17:47,322
..let him go.

427
00:17:48,674 --> 00:17:49,909
Because there's
something inside him

428
00:17:49,996 --> 00:17:51,596
that... we can't find.

429
00:17:51,684 --> 00:17:52,822
Hell,
we can't even name it.

430
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:55,203
There's something there
that's broken

431
00:17:55,604 --> 00:17:59,377
beyond... repair.

432
00:18:03,057 --> 00:18:04,166
In this metaphor,

433
00:18:04,254 --> 00:18:06,136
am I the thing
that is broken beyond repair?

434
00:18:06,224 --> 00:18:08,104
Am I the thing that,
um...

435
00:18:08,745 --> 00:18:10,612
..should just be
thrown over a cliff now?

436
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:11,711
No.

437
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,747
No.
Not you, Maggie.

438
00:18:15,854 --> 00:18:17,244
Us.

439
00:18:26,724 --> 00:18:28,347
So, you're still
broken up?

440
00:18:28,434 --> 00:18:29,347
That's sticking?

441
00:18:29,434 --> 00:18:32,517
It's very,
very sticking.

442
00:18:32,604 --> 00:18:34,760
I think I deserve
better than someone

443
00:18:34,848 --> 00:18:36,416
who regularly
abandons me

444
00:18:36,504 --> 00:18:38,511
for, you know,
trees.

445
00:18:38,599 --> 00:18:40,342
Right?
So, yeah, it's sticking.

446
00:18:40,428 --> 00:18:41,875
You're okay,
right? I mean...

447
00:18:41,963 --> 00:18:42,744
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.

448
00:18:42,832 --> 00:18:44,220
We're fine.
I mean, we're friends.

449
00:18:44,308 --> 00:18:45,722
Our parents are married
to one another.

450
00:18:45,809 --> 00:18:48,000
So, yeah.
Friends.

451
00:18:48,088 --> 00:18:50,322
Or like siblings.

452
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,490
We're definitely not
like siblings.

453
00:18:54,163 --> 00:18:56,503
Mommy, can I wear this
to school?

454
00:18:57,683 --> 00:18:58,916
No.

455
00:18:59,825 --> 00:19:02,807
Because Mommy needs that
for... work.

456
00:19:15,184 --> 00:19:16,854
Aren't you
supposed to be in there?

457
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,690
They tried
to take a selfie.

458
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,494
They climbed all the way
to the top of a mountain.

459
00:19:23,693 --> 00:19:26,674
They made it up
through rain and fog,

460
00:19:26,762 --> 00:19:28,215
and then they tried
to take a selfie,

461
00:19:28,325 --> 00:19:30,002
and he stepped back
and slipped.

462
00:19:31,569 --> 00:19:33,819
He was a miracle,
and now he's...

463
00:19:36,253 --> 00:19:37,830
..not.

464
00:19:38,987 --> 00:19:40,427
And we don't know why.

465
00:19:40,514 --> 00:19:41,783
And that...

466
00:19:43,642 --> 00:19:45,095
Just...

467
00:19:45,354 --> 00:19:47,476
It hurts my body.
It makes me ache.

468
00:19:54,729 --> 00:19:56,472
Hey.
You okay?

469
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,799
- Uh, yeah.
- Baby?

470
00:19:57,887 --> 00:19:59,226
Oh, she's fine,
I think,

471
00:19:59,314 --> 00:20:00,867
but, um,
I don't know where Teddy is.

472
00:20:00,955 --> 00:20:01,729
Have you seen her?

473
00:20:01,817 --> 00:20:04,556
Uh, she panics and she brings
the baby here sometimes.

474
00:20:04,644 --> 00:20:05,596
Why?

475
00:20:05,684 --> 00:20:06,862
Because she doesn't
trust me.

476
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:09,588
B-Because everything I do,
everything I say, is wrong.

477
00:20:09,854 --> 00:20:11,649
New baby.
That's hard.

478
00:20:11,737 --> 00:20:12,807
Yeah.
Oh, God.

479
00:20:12,894 --> 00:20:14,807
When we got Leo, it was hard,
but it wasn't this hard.

480
00:20:14,894 --> 00:20:16,227
No, motherhood is hard
no matter what,

481
00:20:16,314 --> 00:20:17,557
but giving birth
is a beast.

482
00:20:17,644 --> 00:20:19,637
I mean, it's a beast
that changes your whole body

483
00:20:19,724 --> 00:20:22,002
and your whole mind
and your whole heart forever.

484
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:25,226
Hormones are insane,
so just be patient.

485
00:20:25,314 --> 00:20:26,604
Yeah.

486
00:20:28,314 --> 00:20:29,557
I offered
to milk her.

487
00:20:30,502 --> 00:20:31,392
What?

488
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,513
She had a clogged duct
and she was in pain,

489
00:20:33,601 --> 00:20:35,395
and I... her...
The heat pads weren't working.

490
00:20:35,482 --> 00:20:37,430
I just... So you
offered to milk her?

491
00:20:37,518 --> 00:20:38,487
Yeah.

492
00:20:38,575 --> 00:20:39,466
In those exact words?

493
00:20:39,554 --> 00:20:40,760
Yeah.

494
00:20:42,303 --> 00:20:43,303
Wh...

495
00:20:43,392 --> 00:20:44,926
I was just
trying to help!

496
00:20:45,553 --> 00:20:46,658
What?

497
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:49,346
And you said you are available
to start immediately?

498
00:20:49,434 --> 00:20:50,684
I am.

499
00:20:51,854 --> 00:20:53,744
And may I ask why?

500
00:20:55,033 --> 00:20:56,572
Why I'm available?

501
00:20:56,863 --> 00:20:58,526
Why you're interested.

502
00:20:59,354 --> 00:21:02,190
Why I'm interested
to be your chief of surgery?

503
00:21:02,278 --> 00:21:03,680
You've worked
at Grey-Sloan Memorial

504
00:21:03,768 --> 00:21:05,002
for a very long time.

505
00:21:05,103 --> 00:21:07,088
You are well-regarded
and well-respected.

506
00:21:07,184 --> 00:21:08,385
Well...
Well, thank you.

507
00:21:08,473 --> 00:21:10,229
But this job
is enormous.

508
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:12,304
Our new investors are looking
to turn around a hospital

509
00:21:12,391 --> 00:21:14,514
that is ranked last
in Seattle.

510
00:21:14,639 --> 00:21:15,842
This takes vision and...

511
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:17,393
Vision
and experience, yes.

512
00:21:17,511 --> 00:21:19,254
Some experience,
sure.

513
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,947
But, Dr. Webber,

514
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:24,480
aren't you considering retiring
anytime soon?

515
00:21:28,474 --> 00:21:29,887
I am not.

516
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:39,658
Hey.

517
00:21:39,974 --> 00:21:41,320
Hi.
Dr. Avery.

518
00:21:41,408 --> 00:21:42,963
Jackson, please.

519
00:21:43,224 --> 00:21:44,227
Victoria. Vic.

520
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:45,227
Right, right.

521
00:21:45,314 --> 00:21:46,526
Vic.

522
00:21:46,979 --> 00:21:48,972
I never thanked you.
I should have.

523
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:50,473
Oh, God, no.
No.

524
00:21:50,724 --> 00:21:52,541
No, my patients
would have been roadkill

525
00:21:52,629 --> 00:21:53,752
if it wasn't
for you.

526
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,041
Well,
how are they doing?

527
00:21:55,129 --> 00:21:57,202
She's doing well.
Actually, really well.

528
00:21:57,514 --> 00:21:59,914
Uh, he's not as well
as I'd... like.

529
00:22:00,002 --> 00:22:01,227
- I got you.
- Oh, thanks.

530
00:22:01,315 --> 00:22:02,935
But, uh, still,
thank you.

531
00:22:04,684 --> 00:22:06,096
Oh,
just doing my job.

532
00:22:06,207 --> 00:22:07,707
- Yeah.
- So...

533
00:22:09,934 --> 00:22:11,177
Uh,
you know what?

534
00:22:11,264 --> 00:22:13,306
I'm going to grab
a burger at Joe's.

535
00:22:14,463 --> 00:22:16,536
Yeah, I like burgers, but, um...

536
00:22:16,631 --> 00:22:18,071
...maybe
some other time?

537
00:22:19,477 --> 00:22:20,923
Deal.

538
00:22:27,494 --> 00:22:30,237
When you tried so hard
to talk to me and I couldn't,

539
00:22:30,325 --> 00:22:34,488
I felt shame, fear,
and pain.

540
00:22:34,576 --> 00:22:36,977
And what was that shame about
for you, Jo?

541
00:22:38,623 --> 00:22:41,536
That I lost the ability

542
00:22:41,786 --> 00:22:44,239
to receive the love
that he was offering.

543
00:22:44,357 --> 00:22:46,157
Tell him.

544
00:22:51,186 --> 00:22:54,876
That I couldn't receive the love
that you were offering...

545
00:22:55,855 --> 00:22:58,556
and, um,
I pushed you away.

546
00:22:58,644 --> 00:22:59,782
I'm sorry,

547
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:05,330
and I'm afraid that I won't
be able to regain your trust.

548
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,040
Alex?

549
00:23:08,852 --> 00:23:10,548
Did you do
your homework?

550
00:23:11,649 --> 00:23:12,876
Oh.

551
00:23:19,707 --> 00:23:22,220
When you didn't talk to me,
it made me feel...

552
00:23:22,321 --> 00:23:23,597
"I felt."

553
00:23:23,684 --> 00:23:26,712
Nobody makes you feel anything.
Those are your feelings.

554
00:23:28,221 --> 00:23:32,221
When you shut down,
I f... I felt fear.

555
00:23:34,724 --> 00:23:36,110
I still do.

556
00:23:36,434 --> 00:23:39,056
Can you talk a little more
about that fear?

557
00:23:39,144 --> 00:23:40,477
Alex...

558
00:23:43,659 --> 00:23:45,176
You've had enough pain
and crazy

559
00:23:45,264 --> 00:23:47,104
to last you a lifetime.

560
00:23:50,153 --> 00:23:51,153
You deserve someone

561
00:23:51,264 --> 00:23:53,071
who doesn't
break like glass

562
00:23:53,318 --> 00:23:55,806
and need
to be swept up

563
00:23:55,894 --> 00:23:58,083
and shipped off
to places like this.

564
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:01,779
Do you think
that person exists?

565
00:24:03,641 --> 00:24:04,737
I think some

566
00:24:04,824 --> 00:24:07,482
are s-stronger
than other... others.

567
00:24:08,794 --> 00:24:11,513
Jo, you've had
a depressive episode

568
00:24:11,724 --> 00:24:13,872
caused by intense trauma,

569
00:24:14,894 --> 00:24:16,637
and even though
our society tells us

570
00:24:16,724 --> 00:24:19,193
places like this
mean we're broken,

571
00:24:20,054 --> 00:24:22,967
I think the truth is
coming to a place like this

572
00:24:23,054 --> 00:24:24,637
makes you stronger
than most.

573
00:24:33,263 --> 00:24:34,912
There was
an episode of hypotension

574
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,206
in the second surgery,
but we got that under control.

575
00:24:37,301 --> 00:24:40,357
Mm. That is unlikely
to cause a stroke.

576
00:24:40,537 --> 00:24:42,330
I know.
Try this.

577
00:24:42,534 --> 00:24:44,737
If I eat any more, I'm gonna
have to unbutton my pants.

578
00:24:45,129 --> 00:24:46,247
Hot.

579
00:24:46,412 --> 00:24:48,919
Okay, new game.

580
00:24:49,692 --> 00:24:53,029
Name three things
that you have never done,

581
00:24:53,633 --> 00:24:54,737
but you really
want to do.

582
00:24:54,825 --> 00:24:56,988
Ooh.
Good one.

583
00:24:57,201 --> 00:24:59,630
Um...
Okay.

584
00:25:00,659 --> 00:25:02,630
Surf a 20-foot wave...

585
00:25:02,935 --> 00:25:04,107
um,

586
00:25:04,325 --> 00:25:06,583
- ride a camel through the Sahara...
- Mm.

587
00:25:06,856 --> 00:25:11,513
..and, um...
cure Parkinson's.

588
00:25:11,617 --> 00:25:13,083
Now you.
Same question.

589
00:25:13,537 --> 00:25:14,597
Okay.

590
00:25:14,684 --> 00:25:16,131
Mm.

591
00:25:17,854 --> 00:25:20,630
Go to a psychic medium
and talk to my dead father,

592
00:25:20,879 --> 00:25:23,122
get licensed
in scuba diving,

593
00:25:23,554 --> 00:25:26,896
and have sex
with more than one person.

594
00:25:29,818 --> 00:25:31,097
You've never done that?

595
00:25:32,098 --> 00:25:33,056
You have?

596
00:25:33,144 --> 00:25:35,341
I lived in Venice Beach
for a year.

597
00:25:35,644 --> 00:25:36,887
So did I.

598
00:25:36,974 --> 00:25:38,177
And you never
had a three-way?

599
00:25:38,265 --> 00:25:39,952
They're offered up
like mints in Venice Beach.

600
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:41,050
Hmm.

601
00:25:41,138 --> 00:25:43,557
I had
a medical practice there.

602
00:25:43,644 --> 00:25:44,638
Oh.

603
00:25:44,726 --> 00:25:47,505
Yeah, I...
worked in a bike shop.

604
00:25:48,614 --> 00:25:50,052
Fat embolus.

605
00:25:50,474 --> 00:25:51,755
What?

606
00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:56,332
In California,
we had a patient.

607
00:25:56,653 --> 00:25:57,950
Muscle Beach
body builder,

608
00:25:58,038 --> 00:25:59,621
shattered his femur,
just like Jai.

609
00:25:59,713 --> 00:26:00,867
He didn't wake up
from surgery.

610
00:26:00,954 --> 00:26:02,084
It looked like
it was a stroke.

611
00:26:02,171 --> 00:26:04,204
Turns out it was
fat embolism syndrome

612
00:26:04,292 --> 00:26:06,245
from the
long bone injury.

613
00:26:06,333 --> 00:26:08,097
There was
a telltale rash.

614
00:26:08,184 --> 00:26:09,974
Did you check Jai
for a rash?

615
00:26:20,607 --> 00:26:21,701
Wait!

616
00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:23,703
- Just stop! Just wait!
- What are you doing?

617
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:24,863
- Extubating.
- Why?

618
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:26,034
This is
his worst fear.

619
00:26:26,122 --> 00:26:27,097
He doesn't want
to live like this...

620
00:26:27,184 --> 00:26:28,307
Hooked up
to machines.

621
00:26:28,394 --> 00:26:30,137
We're climbers.
People have accidents.

622
00:26:30,224 --> 00:26:30,974
We've talked
about this.

623
00:26:31,062 --> 00:26:32,287
We're both
way less afraid of dying

624
00:26:32,374 --> 00:26:34,310
- than just being kept alive on...
- He has it.

625
00:26:34,442 --> 00:26:35,490
- Has what?
- W...

626
00:26:35,578 --> 00:26:37,513
Link, that's it.
That's the rash, under his arm.

627
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:39,522
Is this reversible
at this stage?

628
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:41,560
Wait, what... what rash?
What does that mean?

629
00:26:41,701 --> 00:26:43,458
It means maybe
we can wake him up.

630
00:26:52,068 --> 00:26:53,211
A fat embolus?

631
00:26:53,411 --> 00:26:55,513
That man didn't have an
ounce of fat on his body.

632
00:26:55,601 --> 00:26:56,451
Right.

633
00:26:56,539 --> 00:26:59,146
I mean, it's the fat
from the bone marrow

634
00:26:59,264 --> 00:27:00,779
in long bones
like the femur.

635
00:27:00,867 --> 00:27:02,385
- Bone breaks, and...
- Oh.

636
00:27:02,473 --> 00:27:05,016
..that fat can travel
into the bloodstream,

637
00:27:05,104 --> 00:27:06,147
which can get lodged
in the brain,

638
00:27:06,234 --> 00:27:08,294
and... it looks like
a stroke.

639
00:27:09,247 --> 00:27:10,427
I never get to know

640
00:27:10,515 --> 00:27:12,308
how the people I rescue
do in the end.

641
00:27:12,494 --> 00:27:15,697
We run into fires
or pull people off of cliffs,

642
00:27:15,785 --> 00:27:17,224
and then
we hand them off to you,

643
00:27:17,312 --> 00:27:19,387
and then we run into
some other fire. So, it's, um...

644
00:27:19,474 --> 00:27:23,387
it's nice, I guess,
to know how he's doing.

645
00:27:23,521 --> 00:27:25,227
I hope
he wakes up.

646
00:27:25,315 --> 00:27:27,068
Yeah, me too.

647
00:27:30,933 --> 00:27:32,638
I...

648
00:27:33,232 --> 00:27:38,144
am just getting out of
a pretty serious relationship.

649
00:27:39,334 --> 00:27:41,964
Uh, me... me too.

650
00:27:43,147 --> 00:27:44,270
Did you love her?

651
00:27:45,318 --> 00:27:47,017
I did, yeah.

652
00:27:47,534 --> 00:27:49,194
Me too.

653
00:27:51,115 --> 00:27:53,451
And, um,
he... he died.

654
00:27:54,497 --> 00:27:56,017
Oh, I'm really sorry to hear that.

655
00:27:56,104 --> 00:27:58,318
Yeah.
Me too.

656
00:28:00,888 --> 00:28:02,347
So, probably...

657
00:28:02,777 --> 00:28:04,105
...not the very best time

658
00:28:04,193 --> 00:28:07,316
for either one of us
to be starting something new.

659
00:28:07,474 --> 00:28:09,146
Yeah, probably not,
because we're both

660
00:28:09,241 --> 00:28:11,614
supposed to just feel miserable
for as long as possible.

661
00:28:12,404 --> 00:28:13,753
So...

662
00:28:13,841 --> 00:28:16,057
Well, if you're gonna
put it like that...

663
00:28:18,374 --> 00:28:19,919
Well...

664
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:24,003
<i>All the way down
to the corner!</i>

665
00:28:24,091 --> 00:28:25,306
Dr. Grey?

666
00:28:25,646 --> 00:28:26,755
Is that you?

667
00:28:26,843 --> 00:28:27,919
Suzie Wilson.

668
00:28:28,007 --> 00:28:30,290
I'm the classroom mom
at Zola's school.

669
00:28:30,465 --> 00:28:32,248
Hi, Suzie.
Hi.

670
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:33,380
What are you
doing here?

671
00:28:33,468 --> 00:28:35,355
Is this
some sort of volunteer thing?

672
00:28:35,443 --> 00:28:36,763
Something like that,
yeah.

673
00:28:36,851 --> 00:28:39,716
Oh, I just love that.
Love that you're doing this.

674
00:28:39,918 --> 00:28:41,115
I always wondered why

675
00:28:41,203 --> 00:28:42,447
we never saw you
volunteering at school,

676
00:28:42,534 --> 00:28:43,857
but now I get it.

677
00:28:44,015 --> 00:28:46,167
This is
really nice to see.

678
00:28:46,255 --> 00:28:47,083
You know, Suzie,

679
00:28:47,171 --> 00:28:49,628
when working moms
don't volunteer at school,

680
00:28:49,716 --> 00:28:53,597
it's usually because
we're working in the daytime

681
00:28:53,685 --> 00:28:54,740
and parenting at night,

682
00:28:54,828 --> 00:28:57,861
so we generally don't have time
to participate.

683
00:28:57,949 --> 00:29:00,662
Grey!
This is not happy hour!

684
00:29:00,768 --> 00:29:01,865
Get back to work

685
00:29:01,953 --> 00:29:03,919
before I tell the court
you're in contempt!

686
00:29:05,514 --> 00:29:07,427
Nice to see you,
Suzie.

687
00:29:07,638 --> 00:29:10,537
I appreciate everything you do
for Zola's class.

688
00:29:12,365 --> 00:29:13,318
Go!

689
00:29:13,406 --> 00:29:14,841
I got it!

690
00:29:21,573 --> 00:29:23,091
Hey.

691
00:29:23,832 --> 00:29:25,958
Aren't you still
on maternity leave?

692
00:29:26,816 --> 00:29:28,497
I hate maternity leave.

693
00:29:28,585 --> 00:29:30,158
Which is... I know.

694
00:29:30,246 --> 00:29:32,277
There are women
the world over

695
00:29:32,365 --> 00:29:34,307
who would kill
for the privilege

696
00:29:34,394 --> 00:29:36,227
of being able
to stay at home

697
00:29:36,314 --> 00:29:38,083
with their newborn baby

698
00:29:38,171 --> 00:29:40,177
and know that they have a job
to come back to.

699
00:29:40,265 --> 00:29:41,294
Mm.

700
00:29:41,382 --> 00:29:42,517
I know that
I should be grateful,

701
00:29:42,604 --> 00:29:43,967
but I hate it.

702
00:29:44,054 --> 00:29:46,557
Owen called me a cow
the other day.

703
00:29:46,826 --> 00:29:47,967
He did what now?

704
00:29:48,054 --> 00:29:50,857
He offered to milk me.

705
00:29:52,173 --> 00:29:53,951
Yeah, I don't even know
what to do with that.

706
00:29:54,099 --> 00:29:57,137
I have a brilliant mind

707
00:29:57,224 --> 00:29:59,872
with no opportunity
to use it.

708
00:30:00,255 --> 00:30:01,517
So,
I-I came to work.

709
00:30:01,604 --> 00:30:03,537
I'm not working,
but I'm at work.

710
00:30:03,625 --> 00:30:05,289
Tell... Bailey, tell me...
Tell me.

711
00:30:05,377 --> 00:30:07,297
Come on, tell me a little bit
about work, please.

712
00:30:08,537 --> 00:30:10,280
I fired
all my favorite people,

713
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:14,904
and my least favorite person
now has power over me.

714
00:30:16,308 --> 00:30:17,721
And the anger
I feel...

715
00:30:17,934 --> 00:30:20,513
The righteous anger is...

716
00:30:21,896 --> 00:30:23,556
it's exhausting.

717
00:30:25,818 --> 00:30:28,177
I think I might be
a terrible mother.

718
00:30:28,645 --> 00:30:29,926
For what it's worth,

719
00:30:30,168 --> 00:30:32,451
I hated
maternity leave, too.

720
00:30:33,014 --> 00:30:35,341
And I am
an excellent mother.

721
00:30:43,997 --> 00:30:45,091
What do you want?

722
00:30:45,179 --> 00:30:47,509
Well, that's a nice way
to greet your mentor.

723
00:30:50,652 --> 00:30:51,735
Coffee?

724
00:30:51,927 --> 00:30:53,349
I'd love a cup.

725
00:30:59,144 --> 00:31:00,841
Applied for a job
last week

726
00:31:00,935 --> 00:31:02,826
with
Pacific Northwest General.

727
00:31:02,951 --> 00:31:04,068
Did they call you?

728
00:31:04,156 --> 00:31:06,069
Put you down
as one of my references.

729
00:31:06,157 --> 00:31:07,410
I don't know.

730
00:31:07,548 --> 00:31:08,451
You don't know?

731
00:31:08,539 --> 00:31:10,865
I don't answer the phone
if I don't recognize the number.

732
00:31:10,953 --> 00:31:12,406
You don't check
your messages?

733
00:31:12,951 --> 00:31:14,966
You know,
I hate your generation.

734
00:31:15,644 --> 00:31:17,887
I hate any generation
other than my own.

735
00:31:17,974 --> 00:31:18,990
Same.

736
00:31:19,078 --> 00:31:21,161
Eh, I'm not gonna get
that job.

737
00:31:21,644 --> 00:31:24,021
The woman doing the hiring
is a child.

738
00:31:24,313 --> 00:31:26,386
She practically
called me grandpa.

739
00:31:26,474 --> 00:31:28,428
Well, can't you get your wife
to do something for you?

740
00:31:28,515 --> 00:31:29,595
No.

741
00:31:31,365 --> 00:31:32,857
Where is your wife?

742
00:31:33,814 --> 00:31:35,794
Does she let you
live like this?

743
00:31:36,185 --> 00:31:37,767
Eh,
she's out of town.

744
00:31:38,365 --> 00:31:39,597
Is she coming back?

745
00:31:39,684 --> 00:31:40,849
I don't know.

746
00:31:41,997 --> 00:31:43,267
You know,
so you got to get it.

747
00:31:43,457 --> 00:31:44,685
What?

748
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:46,750
The job at Pac-North.
I mean, it's still open.

749
00:31:46,854 --> 00:31:47,807
I just checked
this morning.

750
00:31:47,894 --> 00:31:49,307
Wait,
the job's at Pac-North?

751
00:31:49,394 --> 00:31:51,597
Of course it's still open.
Nobody wants to work there.

752
00:31:51,684 --> 00:31:53,307
- No, you want to work there.
- Why?

753
00:31:53,394 --> 00:31:54,935
Because you could
turn it around.

754
00:31:55,023 --> 00:31:57,016
And if you get the job,
you can hire me.

755
00:31:57,388 --> 00:31:59,426
Look, Dr. Webber, I really want
to help you, but...

756
00:31:59,514 --> 00:32:01,130
Oh, look at yourself,
Karev!

757
00:32:01,345 --> 00:32:03,668
You're drowning
in your own filth!

758
00:32:04,193 --> 00:32:05,787
I'm not asking you
to help me.

759
00:32:05,875 --> 00:32:08,114
- I'm asking you to help yourself.
- Alright, stop yelling at me.

760
00:32:08,201 --> 00:32:08,888
This is my house,

761
00:32:08,976 --> 00:32:10,516
and I don't
work for you anymore.

762
00:32:12,394 --> 00:32:14,146
Here.

763
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:19,950
You're worried about
your marriage?

764
00:32:20,849 --> 00:32:23,182
Give your wife
a reason to come back home.

765
00:32:31,474 --> 00:32:34,212
They've been doing this every day
for a week, and nothing has changed.

766
00:32:34,299 --> 00:32:37,326
It's an experimental protocol.
You have to give it time.

767
00:32:38,091 --> 00:32:39,935
I don't want
to give it time.

768
00:32:40,394 --> 00:32:41,677
I want them to stop.

769
00:32:43,394 --> 00:32:44,989
I promised that I would never
let this happen.

770
00:32:45,076 --> 00:32:46,394
We promised each other.

771
00:32:47,982 --> 00:32:49,779
Stop. Stop! Stop!
Stop! Stop!

772
00:32:49,934 --> 00:32:51,449
- Hey. Alright.
- Stop!

773
00:32:51,537 --> 00:32:52,847
Hey,
what is going on?

774
00:32:52,934 --> 00:32:53,537
I don't know
what to say.

775
00:32:53,625 --> 00:32:55,137
What if this
makes him just better enough

776
00:32:55,224 --> 00:32:56,967
that he can't die?

777
00:32:57,778 --> 00:32:59,466
What if... What if this
makes him just better enough

778
00:32:59,553 --> 00:33:02,455
that he is just stuck in
this body for another 20 years?

779
00:33:02,544 --> 00:33:03,849
My husband is living
his worst

780
00:33:03,937 --> 00:33:05,652
- nightmare!
- Mari, Mari, Mari, look at me, okay?

781
00:33:05,739 --> 00:33:07,942
I know it's easier
to imagine worst-case scenarios

782
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:09,613
than it is
to hold onto hope, alright?

783
00:33:09,701 --> 00:33:10,888
But we are not
there yet.

784
00:33:10,976 --> 00:33:12,146
Do you understand me?

785
00:33:12,234 --> 00:33:14,886
It is not the time
to give up on him.

786
00:33:17,346 --> 00:33:19,365
Will you tell me
when it's time?

787
00:33:20,341 --> 00:33:23,013
Yes.
I promise I will.

788
00:33:36,933 --> 00:33:38,096
Hi, Mari.

789
00:33:38,302 --> 00:33:40,597
Thanks for coming.
How are you, um...

790
00:33:40,684 --> 00:33:42,083
Please don't ask me
how I'm doing.

791
00:33:42,171 --> 00:33:44,624
Mari, there's something
we want you to see.

792
00:33:44,857 --> 00:33:46,277
Come on.

793
00:33:48,572 --> 00:33:51,025
I found a place
for him.

794
00:33:51,354 --> 00:33:53,841
It's a pretty nice
long-term care facility.

795
00:33:53,963 --> 00:33:57,247
Didn't smell quite as bad
as the other ones that I saw.

796
00:34:03,553 --> 00:34:04,943
Oh, my God.

797
00:34:05,607 --> 00:34:07,440
Oh, my God.
Is this real?

798
00:34:07,777 --> 00:34:08,716
Is...

799
00:34:08,804 --> 00:34:11,217
Are... Sorry.
Is this real?

800
00:34:11,305 --> 00:34:13,218
It's real.

801
00:34:13,573 --> 00:34:14,614
He's fragile,

802
00:34:14,702 --> 00:34:16,426
but his cognitive tests are good.
Hi.

00:34:16,514 --> 00:34:17,597

00:37:49,206 --> 00:37:50,709
Ah.
This is awkward.

883
00:37:51,878 --> 00:37:52,933
Um...

884
00:37:53,021 --> 00:37:55,636
Amelia, okay, are...
Are you here for your pregnancy,

885
00:37:55,724 --> 00:37:58,425
or just asking
for a ménage à trois?

886
00:37:59,264 --> 00:38:00,637
Not pregnant.

887
00:38:00,919 --> 00:38:02,011
No, no.

888
00:38:02,099 --> 00:38:03,516
I've just gained
a little weight.

889
00:38:04,708 --> 00:38:07,491
No. And I'm not really
asking for a ménage à...

890
00:38:07,764 --> 00:38:09,637
No, I am.
I was.

891
00:38:09,724 --> 00:38:11,628
I... just...

892
00:38:11,747 --> 00:38:13,650
Sounds a little dirtier
in French.

893
00:38:13,738 --> 00:38:15,467
I, uh... I just...

894
00:38:15,554 --> 00:38:17,838
I've been feeling
these, like, curiosities.

895
00:38:17,934 --> 00:38:20,893
Uh-huh.
And, um... surges.

896
00:38:21,054 --> 00:38:22,377
The sexual cravings

897
00:38:22,465 --> 00:38:25,447
can be very intense
during pregnancy.

898
00:38:25,938 --> 00:38:27,400
I-I'm not pregnant.

899
00:38:27,645 --> 00:38:30,164
No, I've just been...
eating a lot.

900
00:38:30,252 --> 00:38:31,802
Link eats a lot.

901
00:38:32,054 --> 00:38:33,486
Listen, uh...

902
00:38:37,559 --> 00:38:38,807
Oh, my God.

903
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:42,783
When was your last period,
Amelia?

904
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,416
Oh, my God.

<i>♪ Tell me if you really... ♪</i>

944
00:40:37,895 --> 00:40:40,938
You stood by
and watched Bailey fire me,

945
00:40:41,191 --> 00:40:43,434
so you don't get to judge
where I work now.

946
00:40:43,536 --> 00:40:45,449
You betrayed me,
Richard Webber.

947
00:40:45,537 --> 00:40:47,120
You chose your loyalty

948
00:40:47,245 --> 00:40:49,596
to Meredith Grey
and her criminal enterprises

949
00:40:49,684 --> 00:40:52,187
over your loyalty to your wife
and her foundation,

950
00:40:52,314 --> 00:40:53,967
and now you want
to humiliate me

951
00:40:54,054 --> 00:40:55,967
and go work
at Pac-North?

952
00:40:56,054 --> 00:40:57,643
I'm sleeping
on the sofa.

953
00:40:58,244 --> 00:41:00,079
<i>Sometimes the best we can do...</i>

954
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:03,330
<i>...is bear each other's burdens
and ease each other's pain.</i>

955
00:41:03,663 --> 00:41:08,174
So, Zola overhears
the school-mom

956
00:41:08,262 --> 00:41:10,580
tell the teacher
I'm a criminal,

957
00:41:10,850 --> 00:41:13,189
and then she asks me
how to spell "criminal."

958
00:41:14,534 --> 00:41:15,697
So, that was fun.

959
00:41:19,604 --> 00:41:22,479
Listen, I'm...
You know, I'm healthy.

960
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:24,393
My kids are healthy.

961
00:41:24,795 --> 00:41:26,458
- And I'm not in jail.
- Yes.

962
00:41:26,546 --> 00:41:27,839
I'm getting exercise.

963
00:41:28,949 --> 00:41:30,775
It's quite meditative,
actually.

964
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:32,549
You sort of just
pick up the trash,

965
00:41:32,637 --> 00:41:33,890
one piece at a time,

966
00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:37,518
and I'm helping the city,
I'm helping the planet.

967
00:41:37,634 --> 00:41:39,417
I still feel
a sense of accomplishment.

968
00:41:39,505 --> 00:41:43,168
So, it's kind of like
a roadside vacation, then.

969
00:41:43,371 --> 00:41:44,387
Exactly.

970
00:41:44,474 --> 00:41:46,033
- I want a roadside vacation.
- Right?

971
00:41:46,121 --> 00:41:47,504
Maybe I'll go
rob a store or something.

972
00:41:47,722 --> 00:41:48,898
Please don't do that.

973
00:41:56,954 --> 00:41:58,316
What is it?

974
00:42:00,494 --> 00:42:02,017
It's a letter
from the medical board.

975
00:42:02,104 --> 00:42:04,971
They're going to pursue action
against my license.

976
00:42:05,939 --> 00:42:07,807
There'll be a hearing.
