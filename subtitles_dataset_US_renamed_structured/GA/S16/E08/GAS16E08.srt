1
00:00:11,376 --> 00:00:12,987
When you sign a medical directive

2
00:00:13,011 --> 00:00:14,592
or a consent to surgery,

3
00:00:14,616 --> 00:00:16,390
there's an important question we ask.

4
00:00:16,414 --> 00:00:17,668
Ready?

5
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:21,261
No.

6
00:00:21,285 --> 00:00:24,264
"In the event of a possibly
fatal complication..."

7
00:00:24,288 --> 00:00:25,466
Thanks for coming...

8
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:34,975
"...do you want us to use
extraordinary measures

9
00:00:34,999 --> 00:00:37,211
to prolong your life?

10
00:00:37,235 --> 00:00:40,214
If your heart stops,
do you want us to begin CPR?"

11
00:00:43,574 --> 00:00:45,753
Hey. You just get back in town?

12
00:00:45,777 --> 00:00:48,055
Yeah. I landed last night.

13
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:49,817
Um, listen.

14
00:00:49,842 --> 00:00:52,320
I'm sorry I didn't call you back.

15
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:54,155
I didn't think it was a good idea for you

16
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:57,725
or your... your mom to come
to Sabrina's service.

17
00:00:57,749 --> 00:00:59,294
Mom didn't go?

18
00:00:59,318 --> 00:01:01,463
Ah, the family's not ready to see anyone,

19
00:01:01,487 --> 00:01:02,897
especially from Seattle.

20
00:01:02,921 --> 00:01:04,466
- "Do you want to be violently shocked...
- Okay.

21
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:06,897
...with 360 joules of electricity?"

22
00:01:06,922 --> 00:01:08,433
So, the book says we can't
start sleep-training

23
00:01:08,457 --> 00:01:09,534
until after six months.

24
00:01:09,558 --> 00:01:11,002
One book. One book says that.

25
00:01:11,026 --> 00:01:12,637
Other books say that you
can start at four months

26
00:01:12,661 --> 00:01:14,205
or when they start dropping night feeds.

27
00:01:14,229 --> 00:01:15,907
Or when the mom starts losing her mind

28
00:01:15,931 --> 00:01:18,443
because of cumulative sleep deprivation.

29
00:01:18,467 --> 00:01:21,045
- Everything okay?
- Allison had us up till 3:00.

30
00:01:21,069 --> 00:01:23,281
Us? You slept through the whole
thing. Or you pretended to.

31
00:01:23,305 --> 00:01:25,717
Hey, hey! Is that coffee?

32
00:01:25,741 --> 00:01:27,352
M-Maybe you should just take it.

33
00:01:27,376 --> 00:01:28,486
Thank you so much.

34
00:01:29,778 --> 00:01:32,323
I don't remember all you people

35
00:01:32,347 --> 00:01:34,025
putting in requests for the day off.

36
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:36,361
And whose fault is it they need to?

37
00:01:36,713 --> 00:01:37,790
Richard.

38
00:01:37,814 --> 00:01:39,725
- Nice to see you.
- Bailey.

39
00:01:39,749 --> 00:01:41,460
"Do you agree to multiple injections

40
00:01:41,484 --> 00:01:45,297
of adrenaline into your veins
or a tube down your throat?"

41
00:01:49,592 --> 00:01:51,870
How far will you go to stay alive?

42
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:58,219
No one's suspending
Meredith Grey's license.

43
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:00,855
She won a Catherine Fox award.
She's a legend.

44
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:02,990
Well, I heard she operated
on a fellow resident.

45
00:02:03,014 --> 00:02:04,525
She took out a healthy appendix.

46
00:02:04,549 --> 00:02:06,994
No, she and Cristina Yang
rescued an intern

47
00:02:07,018 --> 00:02:09,163
who removed another
intern's appendix, incorrectly.

48
00:02:09,187 --> 00:02:10,231
They were helping.

49
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:11,432
That wasn't the other Dr. Grey,

50
00:02:11,456 --> 00:02:12,800
the one that died in the plane crash?

51
00:02:12,824 --> 00:02:14,969
Our Dr. Grey cut a patient's LVAD wire.

52
00:02:15,326 --> 00:02:17,704
See, you consider these things legendary.

53
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:19,473
They're also crimes.

54
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:22,776
I'm a witness at the hearing.

55
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,778
- And I forgot a tie.
- Sounds about right.

56
00:02:24,802 --> 00:02:26,747
My lucky tie was in my locker. Come here.

57
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:29,383
Okay, if anyone should speak
on behalf of Dr. Grey,

58
00:02:29,407 --> 00:02:30,550
it really should be me.

59
00:02:30,574 --> 00:02:32,678
Everybody shut up.

60
00:02:34,004 --> 00:02:37,183
Most of the attendings will be
out for the hearing today,

61
00:02:37,207 --> 00:02:38,417
myself included,

62
00:02:38,441 --> 00:02:40,319
which means you guys have to cover.

63
00:02:40,343 --> 00:02:41,921
If you get into trouble, call me,

64
00:02:41,945 --> 00:02:43,222
but if it's not a disaster,

65
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:46,547
I will bury you in scut for a month.

66
00:02:47,717 --> 00:02:48,794
Don't kill anyone.

67
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:08,608
We'll be right back there,
Meredith, okay?

68
00:03:08,632 --> 00:03:10,443
- Okay.
- All right.

69
00:03:10,467 --> 00:03:12,834
If I was on your operating table,

70
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,971
you'd want me to follow
your instructions, right?

71
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:16,272
Lie there. Breathe in.

72
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:17,907
Fall asleep. Let you do your job.

73
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:19,943
That would be my best shot
at survival, right?

74
00:03:19,967 --> 00:03:21,277
I see where you're going with this.

75
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:24,514
I'm begging you, Meredith.
Sit down, don't talk.

76
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:26,683
And let me do my job. Please.

77
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:27,784
I'm not a baby.

78
00:03:27,808 --> 00:03:29,085
No. You're an adult

79
00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:30,520
who's completely unable to be quiet

80
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:32,422
no matter how much
your well-being depends on it.

81
00:03:32,446 --> 00:03:35,758
And today, it could cost you
your entire future.

82
00:03:36,175 --> 00:03:38,087
The prosecuting attorney
is Ashley Cordova.

83
00:03:38,111 --> 00:03:39,922
Getting questioned by her is like someone

84
00:03:39,946 --> 00:03:42,758
ripping hangnails
off all 10 fingers at once.

85
00:03:42,782 --> 00:03:45,160
Sitting quietly and remaining respectful

86
00:03:45,184 --> 00:03:47,663
will go against every fiber
of your being.

87
00:03:47,687 --> 00:03:48,897
But please.

88
00:03:48,921 --> 00:03:50,265
Just for today.

89
00:03:50,289 --> 00:03:52,267
Just for the next few hours.

90
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:54,403
Sit still and shut up.

91
00:03:54,427 --> 00:03:55,771
Okay.

92
00:03:55,795 --> 00:03:57,473
Thank you. Okay. Let's do this.

93
00:03:57,497 --> 00:03:59,675
Good morning.

94
00:03:59,699 --> 00:04:02,378
Based on the number of witnesses
on the list I just read,

95
00:04:02,402 --> 00:04:05,887
this one's gonna be a circus,
so let's go ahead on record.

96
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:07,156
My name is William Benson,

97
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,358
I am the judge who's been
assigned to this case.

98
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:11,427
We have Ms. Ashley Cordova,

99
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:13,429
who's representing
the Medical Commission,

100
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:16,665
and Ms. Nancy Klein, who will
represent the respondent.

101
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:19,334
The commission panel
includes Dr. Aaron Rosenberg,

102
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:21,703
Dr. Maria Lang, and...

103
00:04:21,727 --> 00:04:24,206
I'm here. I'm here.
I'm here. Sorry. Traffic.

104
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:25,908
Light was out on Broadway.

105
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:28,459
Dr. Rosenberg, Dr. Lang,

106
00:04:28,484 --> 00:04:31,697
and panel chair Dr. Paul Castello.

107
00:04:31,721 --> 00:04:34,766
Mrs. Shepherd, there's some
things you need to know. Ma'am.

108
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:37,135
Give me the papers!

109
00:04:37,693 --> 00:04:39,838
How do we switch out one
of the doctors on the panel?

110
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:41,673
We don't. Why?

111
00:04:41,697 --> 00:04:43,842
Because that one killed my husband.

112
00:04:53,075 --> 00:05:01,049
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

113
00:05:01,296 --> 00:05:03,008
We will follow these protocols

114
00:05:03,032 --> 00:05:04,075
throughout these proceedings.

115
00:05:04,099 --> 00:05:06,089
Paul Castello was the trauma surgeon

116
00:05:06,113 --> 00:05:08,926
who operated on my husband at Dillard.

117
00:05:08,951 --> 00:05:13,032
He did not get a head CT.

118
00:05:13,056 --> 00:05:14,700
Okay. Does he remember you?

119
00:05:14,724 --> 00:05:16,969
It doesn't seem like it.

120
00:05:16,993 --> 00:05:18,570
Which is enraging.

121
00:05:18,594 --> 00:05:20,539
Can we appeal or something?

122
00:05:20,563 --> 00:05:22,508
Yes, but it could be six months

123
00:05:22,532 --> 00:05:24,209
before you're rescheduled.

124
00:05:24,975 --> 00:05:27,246
Ohh.

125
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:30,115
Okay. No, he's taken enough.

126
00:05:30,139 --> 00:05:31,784
He doesn't get another six months.

127
00:05:31,808 --> 00:05:35,187
Let's... We stay.

128
00:05:35,211 --> 00:05:38,991
We are here today in the matter
of Dr. Meredith Grey,

129
00:05:39,015 --> 00:05:40,359
who is charged with allegations

130
00:05:40,383 --> 00:05:42,761
that she practiced
below the acceptable standards

131
00:05:42,785 --> 00:05:44,296
of medical practice in a manner

132
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,099
that exploited patients
and insurance carriers.

133
00:05:47,123 --> 00:05:48,967
In fact, Dr. Grey is...

134
00:05:48,991 --> 00:05:52,404
Dr. Bailey, you've known
Dr. Grey a long time.

135
00:05:52,428 --> 00:05:53,939
Could you speak about that at all?

136
00:05:53,963 --> 00:05:56,275
I met her when she was an intern.

137
00:05:56,299 --> 00:05:58,177
Would you say the two of you
have grown close

138
00:05:58,201 --> 00:06:00,179
- over all this time?
- No.

139
00:06:00,203 --> 00:06:02,381
Didn't Dr. Grey name her son after you?

140
00:06:02,405 --> 00:06:05,117
If you're asking if
her son's name is Bailey,

141
00:06:05,141 --> 00:06:06,975
then, yes, it is.

142
00:06:08,211 --> 00:06:11,323
Dr. Grey is a well-respected
general surgeon.

143
00:06:11,347 --> 00:06:12,491
You've agreed to that.

144
00:06:12,515 --> 00:06:13,659
Is that a question?

145
00:06:13,683 --> 00:06:16,395
Well, when you became chief of surgery,

146
00:06:16,419 --> 00:06:19,698
you asked Dr. Grey to become
your chief of general surgery.

147
00:06:19,722 --> 00:06:21,333
And from my estimation,

148
00:06:21,357 --> 00:06:25,304
a chief of general surgery
is extremely skilled,

149
00:06:25,328 --> 00:06:27,973
organized, dedicated, communicative.

150
00:06:27,997 --> 00:06:30,207
Does that sound correct to you?

151
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:35,503
It does. And she is no longer
my chief of general surgery.

152
00:06:38,007 --> 00:06:39,852
No more questions. Thank you.

153
00:06:39,876 --> 00:06:42,121
Ms. Cordova? Any cross?

154
00:06:42,145 --> 00:06:44,022
Uh, actually, yes.

155
00:06:46,716 --> 00:06:50,696
Dr. Grey has developed
quite the disciplinary record

156
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,499
over all those years
you've known her, hasn't she?

157
00:06:53,523 --> 00:06:55,000
Your name is listed as the doctor

158
00:06:55,024 --> 00:06:57,402
who reported the following incidents...

159
00:06:57,426 --> 00:06:59,605
interns, including Dr. Grey,

160
00:06:59,629 --> 00:07:02,380
admitting to cutting
a patient's LVAD wire.

161
00:07:02,405 --> 00:07:03,682
I do not want to have to testify

162
00:07:03,706 --> 00:07:04,917
against any of you in a court of law.

163
00:07:04,941 --> 00:07:06,952
Dr. Grey performed a surgery

164
00:07:06,976 --> 00:07:09,922
on an intern without an attending.

165
00:07:09,946 --> 00:07:12,458
Dr. Grey instructed a younger resident

166
00:07:12,482 --> 00:07:14,560
to remove a brain tumor without consent

167
00:07:14,584 --> 00:07:16,495
from the patient or attending.

168
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,931
Dr. Grey would not allow
an education consultant

169
00:07:18,955 --> 00:07:20,232
to enter her O.R.,

170
00:07:20,256 --> 00:07:21,633
- so you suspended her.
- You're suspended.

171
00:07:21,657 --> 00:07:25,204
All of these things familiar
to you, Dr. Bailey?

172
00:07:25,228 --> 00:07:26,839
All true.

173
00:07:29,499 --> 00:07:32,744
My daughter, Gabby...
she had terrible stomach pain,

174
00:07:33,152 --> 00:07:36,098
and my neighbor told me about
the free clinic at the hospital.

175
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,733
So you took Gabby there,

176
00:07:37,757 --> 00:07:40,002
where you were seen by Dr. Grey?

177
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:44,340
Yes. She said that Gabby
had a mass in her intestine.

178
00:07:44,364 --> 00:07:45,708
Mm-hmm. And she needed surgery.

179
00:07:45,732 --> 00:07:47,343
But you didn't have health insurance.

180
00:07:47,367 --> 00:07:49,912
For you or your daughter.

181
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:52,548
No, I didn't have insurance.

182
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:54,216
I see.

183
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,485
You must have been terrified
during all of this.

184
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:57,887
Were you by yourself?

185
00:07:57,911 --> 00:07:59,688
Yes. Dani, my wife,

186
00:07:59,712 --> 00:08:03,325
she was in a detention center
at the time, at the border.

187
00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:05,494
This is before they sent her
back to Honduras.

188
00:08:05,518 --> 00:08:08,264
I am so sorry to hear that.
And how's Gabby?

189
00:08:08,288 --> 00:08:10,266
They said that she was
responding very well

190
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:11,667
to the medication.

191
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:13,235
Because we caught it early.

192
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:16,338
Because Dr. Grey did. She saved us.

193
00:08:16,362 --> 00:08:18,318
The world needs more people like her.

194
00:08:19,532 --> 00:08:21,484
More doctors like her.

195
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:26,315
And were you aware Dr. Grey
had committed insurance fraud?

196
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,984
No. I found out when Dr. Webber

197
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:31,453
approached Dr. Grey in the scrub room.

198
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:33,956
He saw her daughter's name
on the schedule and was worried.

199
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,324
Ms. Cordova, can I jump in here?

200
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,326
- By all means.
- Can he do that?

201
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,695
The panel can do whatever they want.

202
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:41,130
Dr. DeLuca, your relationship

203
00:08:41,154 --> 00:08:42,831
with Dr. Grey at the time.

204
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:44,333
She was an attending, and you were...?

205
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:46,035
I was a fourth-year surgical resident.

206
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:47,870
I'm now a fifth year.

207
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:51,140
And you're in a romantic
relationship with your boss.

208
00:08:51,164 --> 00:08:53,850
There's documentation
from Human Resources.

209
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:55,644
I'm sorry. How is this relevant?

210
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:57,146
You didn't alert a supervisor

211
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:58,914
when you found out
what Dr. Grey had done,

212
00:08:58,938 --> 00:09:01,550
so, yes, I'd consider it relevant.

213
00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:03,874
Well, unless... Is it consensual?

214
00:09:06,346 --> 00:09:07,523
It is.

215
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,391
Thank you, Dr. DeLuca.

216
00:09:09,415 --> 00:09:11,560
Not quite yet. I'd like to ask about

217
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:14,096
when you applied for a transfer
from Grey Sloan.

218
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,365
Sure. It, uh... It was nothing.

219
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,834
I was having a bad time in
my intern year, and, uh...

220
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:20,436
- I figured it out, changed my mind.
- Mm-hmm.

221
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,104
And by "bad time," you're referring

222
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:24,974
to your mistreatment
by specific attendings

223
00:09:24,998 --> 00:09:28,877
after a violent incident
with Dr. Alex Karev?

224
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:30,913
I dropped the charges against Dr. Karev.

225
00:09:30,937 --> 00:09:34,683
Oh, I know. I'd like
to present Exhibit B-5.

226
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:38,887
This is from Dr. DeLuca's personnel file.

227
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:40,589
Dr. DeLuca, could you do me a favor

228
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:43,014
and read the highlighted section?

229
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:46,762
Alex! "Since I charged Dr. Karev

230
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:48,864
with a felony,
I feel his fellow attendings

231
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:50,466
want to keep me off their services

232
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:51,700
and out of the O.R.

233
00:09:51,724 --> 00:09:53,769
Because of this,
I feel my residency experience

234
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:54,937
will be compromised."

235
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:56,572
And a little further down, you named

236
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:59,274
one of these attendings.
What's the highlighted name?

237
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:03,000
Dr. Meredith Grey.

238
00:10:04,203 --> 00:10:06,715
But I-I changed my mind.
It was a long time ago.

239
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:09,118
Ancient history. We've worked it out.

240
00:10:09,142 --> 00:10:11,787
Yes. Dr. Grey seems
to have made sure of that.

241
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:14,056
No further questions.

242
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,060
It's okay.

243
00:10:24,323 --> 00:10:26,535
Dr. Schmitt.

244
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:29,805
Dr. Schmitt.

245
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:33,330
Dr. Schmitt.

246
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:37,179
I'm sorry. I, uh...

247
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:39,214
I've never been in a courtroom before.

248
00:10:39,238 --> 00:10:42,125
You still haven't. We're in a hotel.

249
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:45,187
Right. Um...

250
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:46,755
What was the question?

251
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:49,792
Dr. Grey is one
of your teachers, correct?

252
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:51,293
- Yes.
- Mm-hmm.

253
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,818
And she's the best teacher I've ever had.

254
00:10:53,843 --> 00:10:56,255
Dr. Grey always gave me an opportunity.

255
00:10:56,279 --> 00:10:58,190
And she didn't jump in
with the mean nicknames

256
00:10:58,214 --> 00:10:59,851
like everybody else.

257
00:11:00,516 --> 00:11:01,960
And when the hospital got hacked,

258
00:11:01,984 --> 00:11:03,362
it locked the blood bank,

259
00:11:03,386 --> 00:11:06,965
so Dr. Grey had me
become a human blood bank.

260
00:11:06,989 --> 00:11:08,441
For the patient.

261
00:11:09,158 --> 00:11:10,602
It was incredible.

262
00:11:10,626 --> 00:11:14,840
I did pass out in the O.R.,
but I saved the patient.

263
00:11:14,864 --> 00:11:17,509
Wow. That is... very helpful.

264
00:11:17,533 --> 00:11:21,079
I was more interested in your
involvement with Gabby Rivera.

265
00:11:21,103 --> 00:11:22,848
Right.

266
00:11:22,872 --> 00:11:27,245
I rounded on her once
during a peds rotation,

267
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,714
but I was barely there.

268
00:11:28,738 --> 00:11:30,382
Well, you were there
long enough to see a name

269
00:11:30,406 --> 00:11:32,133
on Gabby's I.D. bracelet.

270
00:11:33,743 --> 00:11:35,587
Um...

271
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:38,557
Dr. Schmitt. I'd like to
remind you you're under oath.

272
00:11:38,581 --> 00:11:41,026
And I don't recommend perjuring yourself.

273
00:11:45,354 --> 00:11:48,200
I had heard Mr. Rivera
call his daughter "Gabby,"

274
00:11:48,224 --> 00:11:50,002
but the bracelet said Ellis Grey,

275
00:11:50,026 --> 00:11:54,113
so I thought that the hospital
had made an error.

276
00:11:54,664 --> 00:11:58,493
I wanted to take it
to Dr. Grey and ask, but...

277
00:11:59,168 --> 00:12:00,812
she wasn't there that day.

278
00:12:00,836 --> 00:12:02,547
So what did you do?

279
00:12:05,374 --> 00:12:07,853
Dr. Schmitt. What did you do?

280
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:19,431
I brought it to Dr. Bailey.

281
00:12:19,455 --> 00:12:21,099
I thought it was a mistake.

282
00:12:21,123 --> 00:12:22,834
And I c... I couldn't make
any more mistakes.

283
00:12:22,858 --> 00:12:25,512
- No further questions.
- I...

284
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:27,572
I'm sorry, Dr. Grey.

285
00:12:27,596 --> 00:12:30,731
I-I-I thought that I was doing
the right thing. I'm sorry.

286
00:12:40,317 --> 00:12:42,350
God. What happened?

287
00:12:44,188 --> 00:12:46,132
15-minute recess.

288
00:12:46,156 --> 00:12:48,868
Luis was great, uh, Bailey was a robot,

289
00:12:48,892 --> 00:12:50,768
they know that DeLuca
and Mer are a thing,

290
00:12:50,822 --> 00:12:52,033
so they're probably gonna ignore him,

291
00:12:52,057 --> 00:12:53,234
and Schmitt turned her in.

292
00:12:53,258 --> 00:12:55,836
Schmitt? Damn.

293
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,271
They've gone through everyone's files.

294
00:12:57,295 --> 00:12:59,807
It's a crap-pile of crap.

295
00:12:59,831 --> 00:13:02,682
- How's Meredith?
- She needed some air.

296
00:13:09,574 --> 00:13:13,475
Today may be my actual
last day of being a doctor.

297
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:17,214
Meredith, it's not over.

298
00:13:17,238 --> 00:13:18,990
We won't make it.

299
00:13:19,574 --> 00:13:21,318
If I lose my license...

300
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:23,487
and I can't cut, but you can...

301
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:25,345
we won't make it.

302
00:13:41,706 --> 00:13:44,418
Dr. Hunt, as an Army surgeon,

303
00:13:44,442 --> 00:13:47,269
you've trained and worked with
doctors all over the world.

304
00:13:47,294 --> 00:13:49,705
I have to know,
is Dr. Grey really as good

305
00:13:49,729 --> 00:13:51,956
- as people say she is?
- No.

306
00:13:52,432 --> 00:13:53,843
She's better.

307
00:13:53,867 --> 00:13:55,978
The Catherine Fox award that she won

308
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:59,248
was for a surgery
that saved my sister's life.

309
00:13:59,272 --> 00:14:01,417
Now, if Megan could have
been here today, she'd be...

310
00:14:01,441 --> 00:14:02,718
She'd be showing you

311
00:14:02,742 --> 00:14:05,195
her transplanted abdomen herself.

312
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,198
- So you've come around.
- I'm sorry? Wh...

313
00:14:07,222 --> 00:14:08,700
Exhibit C-2.

314
00:14:08,724 --> 00:14:10,401
These are Dr. Bailey's surgical notes

315
00:14:10,425 --> 00:14:13,304
after Dr. Grey botched
your sister's first surgery.

316
00:14:13,328 --> 00:14:15,173
"Hunt has concerns that Dr. Grey

317
00:14:15,197 --> 00:14:18,443
could not close patient's
abdomen the first time.

318
00:14:18,467 --> 00:14:21,312
If she fails again,
patient has no other options."

319
00:14:21,336 --> 00:14:24,482
The "Hunt" in this note is you, correct?

320
00:14:26,704 --> 00:14:29,149
Dr. Webber, would it be safe to say

321
00:14:29,173 --> 00:14:30,851
that you've seen Dr. Grey partake

322
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:33,087
in a lot of groundbreaking work?

323
00:14:33,111 --> 00:14:34,521
Absolutely. Most recently,

324
00:14:34,545 --> 00:14:37,491
she was published for her
studies with mini-livers in mice.

325
00:14:37,515 --> 00:14:40,678
And going back, I read about a
trial for Alzheimer's disease

326
00:14:40,703 --> 00:14:42,281
carried out under your tenure as chief.

327
00:14:42,305 --> 00:14:44,216
I'm curious why it didn't continue.

328
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,651
Well, that trial ended at Grey Sloan

329
00:14:45,675 --> 00:14:47,085
because someone tampered with it.

330
00:14:47,109 --> 00:14:48,387
Could you elaborate on that?

331
00:14:48,411 --> 00:14:51,356
Is that necessary for this investigation?

332
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:53,847
Answer the question, Dr. Webber.

333
00:14:55,851 --> 00:14:57,505
My wife...

334
00:14:58,888 --> 00:15:02,635
My late wife was a participant.

335
00:15:04,605 --> 00:15:07,117
And I discovered that she was selected

336
00:15:07,141 --> 00:15:09,419
for the placebo

337
00:15:09,443 --> 00:15:12,378
instead of the experimental drug.

338
00:15:14,315 --> 00:15:18,195
I changed the envelopes.
I got her the drug.

339
00:15:18,219 --> 00:15:21,298
And you were the only one involved?

340
00:15:27,522 --> 00:15:29,801
- That's right.
- Thanks for clearing that up.

341
00:15:29,825 --> 00:15:32,737
I know there have been
instances when you...

342
00:15:32,761 --> 00:15:35,440
how should we put it... bent
the rules in favor of Dr. Grey.

343
00:15:35,464 --> 00:15:37,375
Objection. That's pure conjecture.

344
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:39,243
Is it?

345
00:15:40,569 --> 00:15:43,948
- State your name, please.
- Patricia Murphy.

346
00:15:43,972 --> 00:15:45,416
Hi, guys!

347
00:15:45,722 --> 00:15:47,500
You used to work for Dr. Webber?

348
00:15:47,524 --> 00:15:48,635
Sure did.

349
00:15:48,659 --> 00:15:51,170
I was Chief Webber's
administrative assistant.

350
00:15:51,194 --> 00:15:52,839
I also was the point of contact

351
00:15:52,863 --> 00:15:55,675
for the National Residency
Matching Program.

352
00:15:55,699 --> 00:15:57,966
First person to see who had matched.

353
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:02,615
Please see exhibit D-1,

354
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:05,885
the list of interns who matched
Dr. Grey's first year.

355
00:16:05,909 --> 00:16:10,523
Ms. Murphy, could you find
Dr. Grey's name on that list?

356
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,881
Oh, her name isn't on here.

357
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:14,583
Why not? Didn't Meredith Grey match

358
00:16:14,607 --> 00:16:16,118
at Seattle Grace that year?

359
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:18,220
No. Uh, not at first, anyway.

360
00:16:18,244 --> 00:16:20,155
Dr. Webber asked me to set up a call

361
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:22,257
with the President of the NRMP.

362
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:23,459
And next thing I knew,

363
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:26,095
I was adding Grey's name to the roster.

364
00:16:26,119 --> 00:16:28,530
I'm sorry. That sounds like
you're saying Meredith Grey

365
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:30,733
was never supposed to
work at that hospital

366
00:16:30,757 --> 00:16:32,735
in the first place.

367
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:40,718
Dr. Grey and I worked
together through internship,

368
00:16:40,742 --> 00:16:44,121
boards, specializing, everything.

369
00:16:44,145 --> 00:16:45,856
We all started out
competing with each other,

370
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:49,126
but I stopped competing with her
a long time ago.

371
00:16:49,163 --> 00:16:50,396
Did you just call me a nurse?

372
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:54,226
She makes me better. A better,
uh, surgeon, better person.

373
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:56,605
The Medical Commission's
trying to establish a pattern

374
00:16:56,629 --> 00:16:59,508
that Dr. Grey is rash, reckless.

375
00:16:59,532 --> 00:17:01,750
Would you agree with that?
Absolutely not.

376
00:17:01,774 --> 00:17:03,378
She has her reasons
for how she treats patients,

377
00:17:03,402 --> 00:17:04,980
and I always agree with it.

378
00:17:05,004 --> 00:17:07,115
Dr. Grey's oldest daughter

379
00:17:07,139 --> 00:17:09,718
is one of your patients, correct?

380
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,690
You've treated her through the years,

381
00:17:11,714 --> 00:17:15,060
which means you most likely had
to sign off on the adoption.

382
00:17:15,084 --> 00:17:17,251
Why was it held up? Do you know?

383
00:17:18,921 --> 00:17:20,832
What did I do?

384
00:17:20,856 --> 00:17:23,235
U-Unfortunately, those things
always have delays.

385
00:17:23,259 --> 00:17:25,604
I, uh... I mean, I see it all the time.

386
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:29,363
It wasn't because Dr. Grey was
briefly fired from Grey Sloan?

387
00:17:32,435 --> 00:17:35,147
Did Dr. Grey's insubordinate behavior

388
00:17:35,171 --> 00:17:39,084
almost cost her her daughter's
adoption, Dr. Karev?

389
00:17:39,108 --> 00:17:40,352
I'm sorry. I don't...

390
00:17:40,376 --> 00:17:42,569
I don't see how her family
life is relevant here.

391
00:17:42,594 --> 00:17:44,506
Well, she seems to be
fairly cavalier about the law

392
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:46,141
in both her professional
and personal life,

393
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:48,076
so I'd say it's relevant.
In fact, she used her

394
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,345
youngest daughter's identity to
commit insurance fraud, so...

395
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:52,747
Alan Brown, Farrah Alazari,

396
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:54,883
Deborah Greene, and Sam Carter.

397
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:57,408
Dr. Grey, we have your list of
your patient testimonies here.

398
00:17:57,433 --> 00:17:58,743
You don't need to repeat them.

399
00:17:58,767 --> 00:18:00,245
Those are the names of the spouses

400
00:18:00,269 --> 00:18:01,646
of every patient I've ever lost.

401
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:03,548
I remember every single one of them.

402
00:18:03,572 --> 00:18:04,950
Okay. Uh, thank you for that.

403
00:18:04,974 --> 00:18:06,384
You don't get to sit up there

404
00:18:06,408 --> 00:18:08,019
and ask questions about my daughter.

405
00:18:08,043 --> 00:18:09,488
If you want to take my license

406
00:18:09,512 --> 00:18:11,223
and make sure I never see
another patient again,

407
00:18:11,247 --> 00:18:14,192
then you do that,
but you have absolutely no right

408
00:18:14,216 --> 00:18:16,061
to ever mention my daughter's name

409
00:18:16,085 --> 00:18:19,231
because you are the one
who killed her father.

410
00:18:19,255 --> 00:18:20,918
You don't remember me.

411
00:18:20,942 --> 00:18:22,138
Meredith.

412
00:18:22,162 --> 00:18:23,669
But I remember you.

413
00:18:24,627 --> 00:18:27,839
As the coward who stood
over my dying husband...

414
00:18:27,863 --> 00:18:28,874
You're gonna be fine.

415
00:18:28,898 --> 00:18:29,975
...the love of my life,

416
00:18:29,999 --> 00:18:32,511
and you didn't even attempt
to do burr holes

417
00:18:32,535 --> 00:18:34,913
after he failed to get him a head CT.

418
00:18:34,937 --> 00:18:36,281
Burr holes!

419
00:18:36,305 --> 00:18:38,984
We don't have time for a CT!

420
00:18:39,008 --> 00:18:40,886
I was doing burr holes as an intern.

421
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:44,189
That one night should have
cost you your entire career,

422
00:18:44,213 --> 00:18:46,992
but instead you're sitting
up here judging me?

423
00:18:47,016 --> 00:18:49,487
You don't deserve to judge anyone.

424
00:18:50,653 --> 00:18:53,398
Your Honor, if we could, um,
just take a short recess

425
00:18:53,422 --> 00:18:55,600
to evaluate the situation,

426
00:18:55,624 --> 00:18:59,170
see if Dr. Grey's, um, conflict
of interest is, um...

427
00:18:59,194 --> 00:19:01,373
My conflict of interest?!

428
00:19:01,397 --> 00:19:03,642
My medical license should not be
in this man's hands.

429
00:19:03,666 --> 00:19:05,110
- Okay, come on.
- He is dangerous.

430
00:19:05,134 --> 00:19:06,411
Okay, come on, let's go.

431
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:09,481
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

432
00:19:19,001 --> 00:19:20,287
Put the jacket under his head.

433
00:19:20,311 --> 00:19:21,682
- Yeah, yeah, I got it.
- Okay. Do we know

434
00:19:21,706 --> 00:19:23,082
if he has a history of epilepsy?

435
00:19:23,106 --> 00:19:24,750
I'm gonna check for medical
bracelets and I.D. here.

436
00:19:24,774 --> 00:19:26,285
Hey, the paramedics
are here with the gurney.

437
00:19:26,309 --> 00:19:28,320
- What do we got?
- We got a male in his mid-40s.

438
00:19:28,345 --> 00:19:29,722
Started seizing about four minutes ago.

439
00:19:29,746 --> 00:19:32,024
We're maintaining his airway.
And take him to Grey Sloan.

440
00:19:32,048 --> 00:19:34,026
He should have
the very best care there is.

441
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:36,128
- Meredith.
- Can you do that?

442
00:19:36,152 --> 00:19:38,431
Get him on his side.

443
00:19:38,455 --> 00:19:40,099
And get him a damn head CT!

444
00:19:48,631 --> 00:19:49,942
Hey, hey. Ma'am.

445
00:19:49,966 --> 00:19:51,777
Head of trauma.

446
00:19:51,801 --> 00:19:53,779
I wouldn't "ma'am" her.

447
00:19:54,223 --> 00:19:55,768
Seizure stopped two minutes ago

448
00:19:55,792 --> 00:19:57,936
after multiple doses of Diazepam.

449
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:01,106
His last BP was 220/128,
and he's tachy to 145.

450
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:03,742
He needs clevidipine and a head CT ASAP.

451
00:20:03,766 --> 00:20:05,144
I called ahead. Let's get him upstairs.

452
00:20:05,168 --> 00:20:07,412
- Let's go, go, go!
- You guys left the hearing?

453
00:20:07,436 --> 00:20:09,114
We weren't gonna put this all on you.

454
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:25,200
But it... in just
a couple of weeks, it had...

455
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,569
it had... had grown so much
in size, that it was...

456
00:20:27,593 --> 00:20:30,939
it was squeezing up
into the pulmonary artery.

457
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:33,742
Like, the... Do you know
what that is, Jake?

458
00:20:33,766 --> 00:20:35,689
Brett. And no.

459
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:40,315
Well, it's, um...

460
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:43,252
It makes sure that blood
gets to the lungs, which...

461
00:20:43,276 --> 00:20:45,087
You know, important.

462
00:20:45,616 --> 00:20:47,627
But, um, her blood had...

463
00:20:47,651 --> 00:20:51,464
had clotted all the way from here to...

464
00:20:51,488 --> 00:20:53,566
Do you have a red pen?

465
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:55,935
No. And I kinda need that one back.

466
00:21:00,397 --> 00:21:01,841
And another one of these, please.

467
00:21:11,021 --> 00:21:12,797
Did you come to gloat?

468
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:15,735
Just checking on you.

469
00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:17,304
It's 2:00 in the afternoon,

470
00:21:17,328 --> 00:21:20,140
and you appear to be well past
the legal limit.

471
00:21:20,164 --> 00:21:22,442
So gloating.

472
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:26,419
What are you doing here? Are
they on a break or something?

473
00:21:26,443 --> 00:21:29,856
No. It may be canceled.
One of the doctors on the panel

474
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,791
apparently is the one that killed Derek,

475
00:21:31,815 --> 00:21:34,661
so Mer went off on him, and he collapsed.

476
00:21:34,685 --> 00:21:37,613
Possible seizure disorder.
We're not sure yet.

477
00:21:38,522 --> 00:21:41,635
Maybe he forgot to check
the activated clotting time.

478
00:21:44,995 --> 00:21:47,123
You know what happened, right?

479
00:21:47,765 --> 00:21:49,843
My mom told me about it, yeah.

480
00:21:52,002 --> 00:21:54,713
Richard's never gonna speak to me again.

481
00:21:55,706 --> 00:21:57,651
I don't blame him.

482
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,014
Why don't we just leave this here

483
00:22:03,038 --> 00:22:04,783
and I'll get you home?

484
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:06,374
But I need it.

485
00:22:06,398 --> 00:22:09,210
Maggie, I'm sure you have
some wine at home, too, okay?

486
00:22:09,234 --> 00:22:10,688
Come on.

487
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:39,695
You lied to those people.
You flat-out lied.

488
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:43,146
And you answered those questions

489
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:44,681
like you barely know Meredith.

490
00:22:44,705 --> 00:22:45,915
No. I do know Meredith.

491
00:22:45,939 --> 00:22:48,551
I know she will put everything at risk

492
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:50,093
to suit her needs.

493
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:52,529
Meredith is anything but selfish.

494
00:22:52,553 --> 00:22:54,898
Oh, no? She hasn't asked you
to sideline your career

495
00:22:54,922 --> 00:22:56,100
to save her ass?

496
00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:57,868
No, she has not asked me to do that.

497
00:22:57,892 --> 00:23:00,104
Right. 'Cause you just do it.

498
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:02,339
Instead of reasoning with her,

499
00:23:02,363 --> 00:23:04,575
stopping her from
doing something illegal,

500
00:23:04,599 --> 00:23:07,845
like a mentor would do,
you just cover for her.

501
00:23:07,869 --> 00:23:10,881
That's my business. My decision.

502
00:23:12,756 --> 00:23:14,500
Meredith Grey could commit murder,

503
00:23:14,524 --> 00:23:15,835
and you'd hide the body.

504
00:23:15,859 --> 00:23:17,403
You know what? I really
don't have the energy

505
00:23:17,427 --> 00:23:19,105
for this right now.

506
00:23:19,129 --> 00:23:21,707
You cheated the system

507
00:23:21,731 --> 00:23:24,477
to get Meredith into my program.

508
00:23:24,501 --> 00:23:27,447
No, that was my program.

509
00:23:27,471 --> 00:23:30,316
And I did not cheat.
I wrote a recommendation.

510
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:32,574
You chose to go around the system

511
00:23:32,599 --> 00:23:34,310
to get Meredith Grey her way,

512
00:23:34,334 --> 00:23:35,611
no matter the consequences.

513
00:23:35,635 --> 00:23:37,179
And you've been doing it ever since.

514
00:23:37,203 --> 00:23:40,082
You choose her! You always choose her!

515
00:23:40,106 --> 00:23:43,686
My God. You sound... jealous.

516
00:23:44,978 --> 00:23:48,090
Well, I'm getting enough
of that from my wife.

517
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:01,515
Hey. How was the trial?

518
00:24:01,539 --> 00:24:03,551
I-I was really surprised
neither side called me in.

519
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:06,087
I moonlight as an expert witness.

520
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:07,846
I need you to operate.

521
00:24:09,047 --> 00:24:11,559
Wow. You trying to up my bad outcomes?

522
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:12,727
Tom.

523
00:24:12,751 --> 00:24:14,061
Well, now, whoever smelt it dealt it.

524
00:24:14,085 --> 00:24:16,146
This one's all you, Shepherd.

525
00:24:16,821 --> 00:24:19,133
This man killed my brother
on an O.R. table

526
00:24:19,157 --> 00:24:21,302
because he refused to order a CT scan.

527
00:24:21,326 --> 00:24:23,037
And now I have found a massive

528
00:24:23,061 --> 00:24:25,539
hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage.

529
00:24:25,563 --> 00:24:27,275
He needs a craniotomy. Can you do it?

530
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:28,542
Shepherd.

531
00:24:28,566 --> 00:24:30,035
Can you do it?

532
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:33,080
I'll cancel the rest of my day.

533
00:24:33,104 --> 00:24:35,004
Thank you.

534
00:24:42,704 --> 00:24:44,783
Evacuating the hematoma...

535
00:24:44,807 --> 00:24:46,117
gel foam...

536
00:24:47,476 --> 00:24:51,791
Here we go. Nice and steady.

537
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:58,399
Nicely done.

538
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:14,349
Look, I'm not gonna pretend that I never

539
00:25:14,373 --> 00:25:15,984
give Meredith special treatment.

540
00:25:18,144 --> 00:25:20,355
There is a history.

541
00:25:20,379 --> 00:25:23,058
- Her mother.
- Yes.

542
00:25:23,476 --> 00:25:25,187
Meredith is family.

543
00:25:25,211 --> 00:25:26,855
And she also happens
to be one of the more

544
00:25:26,879 --> 00:25:28,757
brilliant surgeons that I've ever taught.

545
00:25:28,781 --> 00:25:33,362
So sometimes putting my career
in jeopardy for her...

546
00:25:33,386 --> 00:25:36,899
is just what you do for family.

547
00:25:37,311 --> 00:25:38,788
Glad to know where I fit in.

548
00:25:38,812 --> 00:25:40,223
That's not what I meant.

549
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:42,192
Tom Koracick is my boss.

550
00:25:42,216 --> 00:25:45,587
Because of your actions.
Because of Meredith's actions.

551
00:25:45,611 --> 00:25:49,148
Because you chose to help her
instead of coming to me.

552
00:25:49,173 --> 00:25:50,450
If I'd have come to you,

553
00:25:50,474 --> 00:25:51,784
my wife would have fired you, too!

554
00:25:51,808 --> 00:25:53,353
Did you not hear the part
where I just said

555
00:25:53,377 --> 00:25:55,255
- Tom Koracick is my boss?!
- You didn't lose your job!

556
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:57,157
Meredith is fighting for her license!

557
00:25:57,181 --> 00:25:59,459
No, I've lost more than my job!

558
00:25:59,483 --> 00:26:00,960
I've lost my hospital!

559
00:26:00,984 --> 00:26:03,596
I lost my best surgeons.
And my best friend.

560
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:07,233
All because someone I thought
I raised betrayed me.

561
00:26:07,257 --> 00:26:09,301
Now, do you know how that feels?

562
00:26:09,927 --> 00:26:12,172
It hurts pretty bad, doesn't it?

563
00:26:12,196 --> 00:26:13,339
That's right.

564
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:15,175
I stuck my neck out for her

565
00:26:15,199 --> 00:26:18,185
because I know she'd do the same for me.

566
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:23,033
And until recently,
I thought you would, too.

567
00:26:29,496 --> 00:26:31,441
Thank you all for your patience.

568
00:26:31,746 --> 00:26:33,524
The Medical Commission has decided

569
00:26:33,548 --> 00:26:35,492
to postpone Dr. Grey's hearing.

570
00:26:35,516 --> 00:26:38,562
Most likely, an entirely new
hearing will take place,

571
00:26:38,586 --> 00:26:40,664
based on today's events.

572
00:26:40,688 --> 00:26:42,099
You can't postpone.

573
00:26:42,123 --> 00:26:45,244
Dr. Karev, we're not exactly
holding a town hall.

574
00:26:45,269 --> 00:26:46,479
Can you please find a seat?

575
00:26:46,503 --> 00:26:48,181
No, you can't postpone
because these people

576
00:26:48,205 --> 00:26:50,917
have come from all over
to speak for Meredith.

577
00:26:50,941 --> 00:26:52,418
I-I'm sorry. What people?

578
00:27:29,116 --> 00:27:31,127
Were all these people
on the witness list?

579
00:27:31,151 --> 00:27:32,429
No idea.

580
00:27:32,453 --> 00:27:35,432
You gonna tell them all
they need to go home?

581
00:27:51,646 --> 00:27:53,257
I was trapped in an ambulance,

582
00:27:53,281 --> 00:27:55,159
upside down, soaked in my own blood,

583
00:27:55,183 --> 00:27:57,728
while my best friend was dead beside me.

584
00:27:57,752 --> 00:28:00,464
It was the most scared I've
ever been in my entire life.

585
00:28:00,758 --> 00:28:02,135
And what did Dr. Grey do?

586
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:03,870
She climbed into the damn thing with me.

587
00:28:03,894 --> 00:28:05,205
Admitted she was scared, too.

588
00:28:05,229 --> 00:28:08,942
Then she proceeded to stab me in
the chest with a giant needle.

589
00:28:08,966 --> 00:28:11,011
Which saved my life.

590
00:28:11,035 --> 00:28:13,580
When Dr. Grey diagnosed
the tumor in my liver,

591
00:28:13,604 --> 00:28:14,681
I retired.

592
00:28:14,705 --> 00:28:16,917
I gave my cats away to my daughter,

593
00:28:16,941 --> 00:28:18,285
bought a pair of designer shoes,

594
00:28:18,309 --> 00:28:20,487
and splurged on the trip of my dreams.

595
00:28:20,511 --> 00:28:21,788
And now I'm broke.

596
00:28:23,395 --> 00:28:25,940
Dr. Grey pioneered such
an incredible surgery,

597
00:28:25,964 --> 00:28:27,875
I had to go to the
superintendent of schools

598
00:28:27,899 --> 00:28:29,610
and beg for my job back.

599
00:28:29,634 --> 00:28:33,014
She diagnosed my cancer
and saved my life.

600
00:28:33,038 --> 00:28:35,049
And my treatment's being done pro Bono.

601
00:28:35,073 --> 00:28:37,261
And Dr. Grey saw to that.

602
00:28:37,286 --> 00:28:39,163
She hasn't claimed credit for it,

603
00:28:39,187 --> 00:28:40,565
but I know she did it.

604
00:28:40,589 --> 00:28:42,834
I guess I met her on
her very first day as a doctor.

605
00:28:42,858 --> 00:28:44,536
And it showed. I mean, someone needed

606
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,137
to help her unlock the wheels
of the gurney.

607
00:28:46,161 --> 00:28:48,473
She was green. And I was just awful.

608
00:28:48,497 --> 00:28:51,743
But on Dr. Grey's very
first day as a doctor,

609
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,624
she was the only one
that could figure out

610
00:28:53,648 --> 00:28:54,959
what was wrong with me.

611
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:56,794
And because of her, I am sitting here,

612
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:58,629
with a newborn baby girl at home,

613
00:28:58,653 --> 00:29:01,766
and I just hope that I can give her back

614
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:05,224
a little of the help that she gave to me.

615
00:29:07,462 --> 00:29:10,908
Hemorrhage has been evacuated.

616
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:13,861
Miraculously, if I do say so myself.

617
00:29:13,885 --> 00:29:14,862
Drain, please.

618
00:29:14,886 --> 00:29:16,530
How you doing?

619
00:29:17,388 --> 00:29:19,157
Do you want to go somewhere?

620
00:29:20,024 --> 00:29:21,702
I want to stay.

621
00:29:22,193 --> 00:29:24,505
I have dreamt about this day.

622
00:29:24,975 --> 00:29:26,920
I have dreamt that the world
would be fair and just

623
00:29:26,944 --> 00:29:28,755
and that the man on that table
might experience

624
00:29:28,779 --> 00:29:32,492
a fraction of the pain that
he caused when his arrogance

625
00:29:32,516 --> 00:29:35,340
took away my favorite person
in the entire world.

626
00:29:36,687 --> 00:29:38,364
And I thought...

627
00:29:38,388 --> 00:29:40,266
if I saw inside that man's skull,

628
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:43,836
I might jam a scalpel
into his motor cortex

629
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:45,934
just to paralyze him.

630
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:48,697
Just so that he would
have to lie in a bed

631
00:29:48,721 --> 00:29:50,865
for the rest of his life
knowing what he took

632
00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:52,734
from me and Meredith...

633
00:29:52,758 --> 00:29:54,860
and the kids, my mom.

634
00:29:56,862 --> 00:29:58,662
I think we should stay.

635
00:30:00,966 --> 00:30:02,110
Thank you.

636
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:04,846
But up here...

637
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:07,838
far away from the scalpels.

638
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:11,286
And, you know, I...

639
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:13,846
I could get us some popcorn if you want.

640
00:30:16,306 --> 00:30:18,684
Damn it.

641
00:30:23,496 --> 00:30:26,308
"Dear Medical Commission,
people who know me

642
00:30:26,332 --> 00:30:28,477
would describe me as selfish to a fault.

643
00:30:28,501 --> 00:30:29,945
After that, they'd say honest.

644
00:30:29,969 --> 00:30:31,880
I can honestly tell you
that if I were dying

645
00:30:31,904 --> 00:30:34,683
and a surgery stood between me and death,

646
00:30:34,707 --> 00:30:36,452
Dr. Grey's hands are the only ones

647
00:30:36,476 --> 00:30:38,754
that I'd want inside my body.

648
00:30:38,778 --> 00:30:41,356
Taking away her license is
signing the death certificates

649
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:43,392
of countless future patients.

650
00:30:43,416 --> 00:30:46,862
She is a light in a broken
system that she will fix,

651
00:30:46,886 --> 00:30:48,664
whether you want her to or not.

652
00:30:48,688 --> 00:30:52,101
She is the sun, and she is unstoppable.

653
00:30:52,476 --> 00:30:55,721
Sincerely, Dr. Cristina Yang."

654
00:31:01,351 --> 00:31:02,462
Um, I have more.

655
00:31:02,486 --> 00:31:05,465
I've got, uh, Dr. Calliope Torres,

656
00:31:05,489 --> 00:31:07,733
uh, Dr. Arizona Robbins,

657
00:31:07,757 --> 00:31:09,268
Dr. April Kepner...

658
00:31:09,292 --> 00:31:11,671
That's enough. Thank you. That's fine.

659
00:31:11,695 --> 00:31:13,772
Um, no, I can keep going if you want.

660
00:31:13,797 --> 00:31:14,774
- It's fine.
- Addison Montgomery.

661
00:31:14,798 --> 00:31:16,176
- You don't?
- That's good.

662
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,111
- Okay.
- Good.

663
00:31:18,135 --> 00:31:19,251
He sparked a re-bleed.

664
00:31:19,275 --> 00:31:20,433
Pressure's through the roof.

665
00:31:20,457 --> 00:31:21,514
Can you get control?

666
00:31:21,538 --> 00:31:22,715
Suction.

667
00:31:22,739 --> 00:31:24,214
- V-Fib.
- Push one of epi.

668
00:31:24,239 --> 00:31:27,352
Let's get him flat
and get the paddles ready.

669
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:35,093
Thank you, everyone,
for your time. Again.

670
00:31:35,117 --> 00:31:37,228
Uh, now, if I could please have
everyone clear the room.

671
00:31:37,252 --> 00:31:39,664
Uh, excuse me. Sorry. Sorry. Excuse me.

672
00:31:39,688 --> 00:31:42,895
Hi. Hi. I'm sorry. Your Honor.

673
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,798
Uh, I... I have something more to say

674
00:31:44,822 --> 00:31:46,166
about Meredith Grey.

675
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:48,202
For God's sakes, who doesn't?

676
00:31:48,226 --> 00:31:51,572
Okay, well, ever since
I first met Meredith Grey...

677
00:31:51,596 --> 00:31:54,675
I knew she was going to be
a thorn in my side.

678
00:31:54,699 --> 00:31:56,443
You're worried about her breaking rules?

679
00:31:56,467 --> 00:31:57,711
Well, that's not gonna stop.

680
00:31:57,735 --> 00:31:59,413
She's been doing that since day one.

681
00:31:59,437 --> 00:32:03,780
And, yes, she broke a law to save a life.

682
00:32:04,609 --> 00:32:07,354
So she deserved to lose her job.

683
00:32:07,378 --> 00:32:09,690
She deserves to pick up trash.

684
00:32:09,714 --> 00:32:13,394
No one should be questioning her license.

685
00:32:13,418 --> 00:32:15,929
She's too good at what she does.

686
00:32:15,953 --> 00:32:18,932
And she's worked too hard
to get to where she is.

687
00:32:18,956 --> 00:32:20,768
And with all...

688
00:32:20,792 --> 00:32:23,737
all that she has survived,

689
00:32:23,761 --> 00:32:27,141
it hasn't made her... hard.

690
00:32:27,467 --> 00:32:30,212
It hasn't made her mean or... or cold.

691
00:32:30,236 --> 00:32:32,548
It hasn't made her not care.

692
00:32:32,572 --> 00:32:34,394
It's made her...

693
00:32:36,062 --> 00:32:37,786
better.

694
00:32:37,810 --> 00:32:40,489
It's made her better
than anyone in this room.

695
00:32:42,548 --> 00:32:44,493
Well, except me.

696
00:32:44,517 --> 00:32:46,650
I'm Dr. Miranda Bailey,

697
00:32:46,677 --> 00:32:51,057
chief of surgery
at Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital.

698
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:54,961
And I approve this message.

699
00:33:10,034 --> 00:33:11,311
He's gone.

700
00:33:46,166 --> 00:33:47,777
Castello didn't make it.

701
00:33:47,801 --> 00:33:49,946
Wasn't me. I didn't kill him.

702
00:33:50,294 --> 00:33:52,138
Should I be blaming myself
for yelling at him?

703
00:33:52,162 --> 00:33:53,973
No, he gets all the blame.

704
00:33:53,997 --> 00:33:55,775
Not only was he a terrible
doctor to patients,

705
00:33:55,799 --> 00:33:58,678
but he forgot that high blood
pressure's the silent killer.

706
00:33:58,702 --> 00:34:00,772
And, boy, did he let it get to him.

707
00:34:04,908 --> 00:34:06,953
- Tell me.
- They're not postponing.

708
00:34:06,977 --> 00:34:10,019
Uh, should one of us tell them
that their panel chair died?

709
00:34:10,044 --> 00:34:11,988
Ooh. They'll ask when they're ready.

710
00:34:12,012 --> 00:34:13,890
Right now, they're sending
their recommendation

711
00:34:13,914 --> 00:34:15,492
to the Medical Commission.

712
00:34:15,516 --> 00:34:16,617
- What?
- Okay.

713
00:34:16,641 --> 00:34:17,761
It's a majority vote.

714
00:34:17,785 --> 00:34:20,664
So even if Castello voted
to suspend Meredith's license,

715
00:34:20,688 --> 00:34:23,767
the other two doctors voted
to drop the entire thing.

716
00:34:23,791 --> 00:34:25,802
- It's over.
- I still have my license?

717
00:34:25,826 --> 00:34:27,704
Yes. And I'm so grateful it's over

718
00:34:27,728 --> 00:34:29,506
because you're one of
the most exhausting clients

719
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:30,674
I've ever had.

720
00:34:30,698 --> 00:34:32,909
Congratulations, Dr. Grey.

721
00:34:32,933 --> 00:34:35,145
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Yeah!

722
00:34:35,169 --> 00:34:38,515
- Aww.
- Congratulations.

723
00:34:38,539 --> 00:34:40,751
Thank you. Thank you. Good job!

724
00:34:58,134 --> 00:35:00,846
You said some very nice things
to the panel in there.

725
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:02,584
Thank you.

726
00:35:03,272 --> 00:35:06,284
Uh, so, um, see you Monday then.

727
00:35:06,308 --> 00:35:08,053
What?

728
00:35:08,077 --> 00:35:09,591
Come back.

729
00:35:10,546 --> 00:35:12,057
I'm sorry?

730
00:35:12,081 --> 00:35:15,093
Come back to Grey Sloan.

731
00:35:15,117 --> 00:35:16,394
Ooh.

732
00:35:16,418 --> 00:35:19,664
You are a pain in my ass.

733
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:22,367
But you're a fine surgeon.

734
00:35:22,854 --> 00:35:25,070
And your name's on the damn sign.

735
00:35:25,565 --> 00:35:27,651
And I need you.

736
00:35:28,597 --> 00:35:31,510
So you fired me and now
you want me to come back?

737
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,512
You want me to beg?

738
00:35:36,622 --> 00:35:38,166
Thank you.

739
00:35:40,159 --> 00:35:41,836
Is that a yes?

740
00:35:42,332 --> 00:35:44,105
That's a big, fat yes.

741
00:35:47,399 --> 00:35:49,344
I'll see you Monday.

742
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:58,607
I hate to bring this up now, but have you

743
00:35:59,373 --> 00:36:02,052
seen or heard anything
with Richard and my mom?

744
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:03,420
Any idea how they're doing?

745
00:36:03,444 --> 00:36:05,289
You're asking the wrong person.

746
00:36:05,313 --> 00:36:07,391
Right. Sorry.

747
00:36:07,777 --> 00:36:10,155
I just didn't know if maybe
he mentioned anything...

748
00:36:10,179 --> 00:36:11,545
before.

749
00:36:13,249 --> 00:36:15,427
And do you think, um...

750
00:36:15,451 --> 00:36:17,729
think they're having some problems?

751
00:36:17,753 --> 00:36:22,601
I don't know. It's just kind of
a sense that I get. I guess.

752
00:36:22,625 --> 00:36:25,437
I mean, it can't be easy.

753
00:36:25,461 --> 00:36:27,172
With him being fired

754
00:36:27,196 --> 00:36:29,241
and working somewhere else...

755
00:36:29,266 --> 00:36:31,177
...and her traveling all the time.

756
00:36:31,201 --> 00:36:32,645
Owen.

757
00:36:32,669 --> 00:36:35,047
Mer gets to keep her license.

758
00:36:35,071 --> 00:36:37,083
Yay, Mer!

759
00:36:37,107 --> 00:36:39,003
I didn't help at all.

760
00:36:39,028 --> 00:36:40,972
You did help by not testifying.

761
00:36:45,201 --> 00:36:46,900
Wow.

762
00:36:49,972 --> 00:36:51,905
This is kind of nice.

763
00:36:54,176 --> 00:36:55,780
Not fighting?

764
00:36:56,478 --> 00:36:58,366
I've missed it.

765
00:36:58,948 --> 00:37:01,793
You. I guess I missed you.

766
00:37:01,817 --> 00:37:03,795
Us being able to talk,

767
00:37:03,819 --> 00:37:06,220
knowing what's going on
in each other's lives.

768
00:37:24,873 --> 00:37:26,050
Ah, I can't. I'm sorry.

769
00:37:26,074 --> 00:37:29,017
I can't. I shouldn't.
Obviously, I'm in something...

770
00:37:29,042 --> 00:37:31,320
Oh, my God. Uh, you should leave.

771
00:37:31,344 --> 00:37:32,555
Okay. We can...

772
00:37:32,579 --> 00:37:35,925
No. Get out, Jackson. Go. Get out now!

773
00:37:45,959 --> 00:37:47,236
- Hey.
- Hey.

774
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:50,173
Congrats on your license.

775
00:37:50,197 --> 00:37:52,074
Thanks.

776
00:37:52,098 --> 00:37:54,010
Maggie, what just happened?

777
00:37:54,034 --> 00:37:56,145
I hate someone I used to love.

778
00:37:56,169 --> 00:37:59,446
Don't let him in.

779
00:37:59,471 --> 00:38:01,550
I don't want to see
or speak to him ever again.

780
00:38:01,574 --> 00:38:03,818
Okay, okay.

781
00:38:08,647 --> 00:38:09,991
- Hey.
- Hey.

782
00:38:10,015 --> 00:38:12,527
- Can we talk?
- Yeah.

783
00:38:12,551 --> 00:38:15,144
Extraordinary measures can have a cost.

784
00:38:15,958 --> 00:38:17,169
You may be alive,

785
00:38:17,193 --> 00:38:19,171
but life may not be the same
as you remember.

786
00:38:26,269 --> 00:38:28,873
Didn't think you had it in you, Schmitt.

787
00:38:29,472 --> 00:38:32,818
I just heard Schmitt here
was the one who ratted out Grey.

788
00:38:32,842 --> 00:38:36,822
Damn, man. You're lucky
she kept her license.

789
00:38:44,915 --> 00:38:46,927
Your body may not move as easily.

790
00:38:51,022 --> 00:38:52,399
Feelings may be gone.

791
00:38:58,129 --> 00:39:01,008
And it can take a long time to recover.

792
00:39:01,032 --> 00:39:02,699
I'm sorry.

793
00:39:02,967 --> 00:39:04,678
I'm sorry for what I said.

794
00:39:04,702 --> 00:39:07,114
I... I didn't mean
that we wouldn't make it.

795
00:39:07,139 --> 00:39:08,984
I just... I don't know.

796
00:39:09,008 --> 00:39:11,319
I don't know what I meant.
I-I was scared.

797
00:39:11,343 --> 00:39:14,055
Mer, don't. Okay? Y-You meant it.

798
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:15,323
No, I-I didn't.

799
00:39:15,347 --> 00:39:16,925
I stood up for you in court.

800
00:39:16,949 --> 00:39:19,461
I defended you at the hospital.

801
00:39:19,485 --> 00:39:20,829
I went to jail for you.

802
00:39:20,853 --> 00:39:23,565
I know, and I didn't ask you
to do any of those things.

803
00:39:23,589 --> 00:39:25,667
I know. But I did it anyway
because I love you.

804
00:39:25,691 --> 00:39:27,135
Because I'd do anything for you.

805
00:39:27,159 --> 00:39:30,405
Because that's what you do
for your partner.

806
00:39:30,691 --> 00:39:33,937
But I'm not your partner.

807
00:39:33,961 --> 00:39:35,672
Am I?

808
00:39:35,696 --> 00:39:38,508
There's a reason
it's a difficult decision.

809
00:39:38,532 --> 00:39:41,978
The look in your eye when
you spoke about Derek today

810
00:39:42,002 --> 00:39:43,513
made me realize what it is
I've been feeling

811
00:39:43,537 --> 00:39:45,283
this whole time.

812
00:39:46,006 --> 00:39:48,385
You didn't just love Derek.

813
00:39:48,409 --> 00:39:50,288
You respected him.

814
00:39:51,245 --> 00:39:52,823
That's different.

815
00:39:52,847 --> 00:39:54,580
And you can't compare.

816
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:58,672
- I do respect you.
- Come on.

817
00:39:58,696 --> 00:40:00,640
Y-You're telling me there's
not some small part of you

818
00:40:00,664 --> 00:40:02,075
that doesn't wonder if I'm your equal?

819
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:03,977
If I'm at your level? If I ever will be?

820
00:40:08,772 --> 00:40:11,226
Take some time, Meredith.

821
00:40:11,775 --> 00:40:13,811
Figure out what it is that you want.

822
00:40:14,478 --> 00:40:16,022
And...

823
00:40:19,617 --> 00:40:21,795
Let me know if I'm a part of that.

824
00:40:23,621 --> 00:40:25,026
Good night.

825
00:40:28,425 --> 00:40:31,266
You just have to decide
if it's all worth it.
