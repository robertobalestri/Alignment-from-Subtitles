1
00:00:02,792 --> 00:00:04,009
Morning Zelda.

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,971
<i>All deseases
have a genetic component.</i>

3
00:00:06,057 --> 00:00:07,526
- Auntie Maggie?
- Yes.

4
00:00:07,612 --> 00:00:09,190
Is Grandma Ellis
your mom?

5
00:00:09,294 --> 00:00:10,572
Biologically, yes.

6
00:00:10,691 --> 00:00:12,487
But Diane and Bill
raised me,

7
00:00:12,573 --> 00:00:14,197
so they're
my mom and dad.

8
00:00:14,531 --> 00:00:16,353
Just like my mom and dad
raised me.

9
00:00:16,439 --> 00:00:17,462
Yup.

10
00:00:17,548 --> 00:00:20,336
<i>But of course,
genes are not always to blame.</i>

11
00:00:20,422 --> 00:00:22,065
Margaret, before you
publish your next piece,

12
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:24,236
you really ought to let me
proofread your work.

13
00:00:25,002 --> 00:00:26,517
It's riddled with typos.

14
00:00:26,603 --> 00:00:27,814
What?

15
00:00:27,951 --> 00:00:30,369
No, it's not!

16
00:00:30,501 --> 00:00:32,184
- And don't make that face.
- What face?

17
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:34,386
That face... like you've got
some secret we don't know.

18
00:00:34,471 --> 00:00:35,682
The Meredith face.

19
00:00:35,768 --> 00:00:37,952
Well, Meredith got it from me,
so it's the Ellis face.

20
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,454
<i>In diagnosing a disease,</i>

21
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,367
<i>physicians must take into
account other factors.</i>

22
00:00:42,535 --> 00:00:43,647
Who are you?

23
00:00:43,856 --> 00:00:45,874
I'm Derek's sister.
We must have met before.

24
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,304
I think I'remember.

25
00:00:47,629 --> 00:00:48,776
Would you, though?

26
00:00:48,862 --> 00:00:50,554
<i>Their environment.</i>

27
00:00:50,848 --> 00:00:52,484
<i>Their lifestyle.</i>

28
00:00:55,155 --> 00:00:56,375
What does that mean?

29
00:00:56,558 --> 00:00:59,140
Your mom will know.
Quick, write it down.

30
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:05,625
Don't forget to take
your vitamins, dears.

31
00:01:16,535 --> 00:01:20,937
<i>However, some genetic traits are,
annoyingly, unavoidable.</i>

53
00:02:19,145 --> 00:02:22,429

57
00:02:28,805 --> 00:02:31,109

Hey, you.

66
00:02:50,145 --> 00:02:52,507
Helm says you, uh, handed off
all your surgeries.

67
00:02:52,593 --> 00:02:53,828
What are you
working on?

68
00:02:54,082 --> 00:02:55,570
I'm not totally sure yet.

69
00:02:55,656 --> 00:02:57,336
It... It came to me
in a dream.

70
00:02:57,453 --> 00:02:58,802
You dream science?

71
00:02:58,906 --> 00:03:01,289
Rarely,
but thank you.

72
00:03:01,871 --> 00:03:03,254
How's it going
with your dad?

73
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,468
Weirdly, not terrible.

74
00:03:04,554 --> 00:03:06,143
He seems stable,
but it's hard to tell.

75
00:03:06,228 --> 00:03:08,312
- He's here today with a pitch.
- A pitch?

76
00:03:08,422 --> 00:03:09,813
A medical breakthrough,
he says.

77
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:12,117
"It's gonna
change the world, Andrea."

78
00:03:13,135 --> 00:03:15,296
He gets these big ideas,
he gets obsessed with them,

79
00:03:15,382 --> 00:03:17,898
and then he just cycles out
and loses interest.

80
00:03:17,992 --> 00:03:19,564
It... It probably won't
amount to much.

81
00:03:19,676 --> 00:03:21,718
- Is there a diagnosis or...?
- No.

82
00:03:21,824 --> 00:03:23,976
But Carina seems to think
he's got bipolar,

83
00:03:24,062 --> 00:03:25,664
but he refuses treatment,
of course,

84
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,172
so we don't really know.

85
00:03:27,258 --> 00:03:30,211
He just says he, uh,
feels the world deeply.

86
00:03:30,413 --> 00:03:31,720
Well, that's poetic.

87
00:03:31,806 --> 00:03:33,031

- Hey.
- Hello.

102
00:03:58,856 --> 00:04:01,304
- More interviews?
- Yeah, some medical podcast.

103
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:03,414
She's on fire, though.

104
00:04:03,552 --> 00:04:05,406
Why do they call it that?

105
00:04:05,604 --> 00:04:07,226
"Podcast."

106
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:08,882
I mean, there's pea pods.

107
00:04:08,968 --> 00:04:10,968
There are certain pods
in aviation.

108
00:04:11,054 --> 00:04:12,335
Whales swim in pods,

109
00:04:12,421 --> 00:04:15,117
but that word has nothing to do
with audio recording.

110
00:04:15,203 --> 00:04:18,062
Right. Uh,
I got a rotation-plasty.

111
00:04:18,148 --> 00:04:19,368
What does that have
to do with...

112
00:04:19,453 --> 00:04:20,648
Nothing, sir.

113
00:04:24,202 --> 00:04:26,310
We hear
you were a bit of a prodigy.

114
00:04:26,551 --> 00:04:28,349
You finished med school at 19.

115
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:31,654
You made chief of cardio
at Tufts at 27.

116
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:32,796
- Impressive.
- Yeah.

117
00:04:32,881 --> 00:04:34,231
Thank you. Yes.

118
00:04:34,316 --> 00:04:36,060
Um, I had a very strong family.

119
00:04:36,146 --> 00:04:38,235
My parents told me I could be
whatever I wanted to be.

120
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,836
Are they surgeons, as well?

121
00:04:39,921 --> 00:04:41,238
Oh, God, no.

122
00:04:41,323 --> 00:04:43,216
Then what drew you
to the field?

123
00:04:43,466 --> 00:04:44,818
You know,
I can't really remember

124
00:04:44,904 --> 00:04:46,787
ever not wanting to be a doctor.

125
00:04:46,928 --> 00:04:49,451
I knew at age 12 that
I wanted to be a surgeon.

126
00:04:49,537 --> 00:04:50,990
By 14, that it was cardio.

127
00:04:51,076 --> 00:04:52,685
Wow. Born to be a surgeon.

128
00:04:52,771 --> 00:04:55,201
Yeah, yeah. It makes you wonder
about a genetic component.

129
00:04:55,287 --> 00:04:56,568
Uh, genetic?

130
00:04:56,662 --> 00:05:00,185
Yeah. Well, both my biological
parents were surgeons.

131
00:05:00,271 --> 00:05:02,993
Although Ellis and Richard
were both in general surgery.

132
00:05:03,078 --> 00:05:04,494
Same with my sister, Meredith.

133
00:05:04,579 --> 00:05:06,038
So I don't know where
the hearts come in.

134
00:05:06,123 --> 00:05:08,138
That must be nurture over nature.

135
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:10,560
I'm... I'm sorry. Did you say
Ellis and Meredith?

136
00:05:10,646 --> 00:05:12,001
- Hm?
- As in Grey?

137
00:05:12,087 --> 00:05:13,841
Ellis and Meredith Grey?

138
00:05:14,388 --> 00:05:15,552
Oh.

139
00:05:15,937 --> 00:05:18,255
Well, ah...
M-My point was that...

140
00:05:18,393 --> 00:05:20,044
And... And Richard is...?

141
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,904
Uh, my... my biological father,
Richard Webber.

142
00:05:24,066 --> 00:05:25,882
- I'm sorry.
- Are you saying that Ellis Grey,

143
00:05:25,967 --> 00:05:27,684
two-time Harper Avery Award winner,

144
00:05:27,769 --> 00:05:30,583
mother of Meredith Grey,
is your birth mother?

145
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:32,193
Um...

146
00:05:32,816 --> 00:05:34,797
M-M-Maybe we can edit that.

147
00:05:34,976 --> 00:05:36,333
- Holy crap.
- Wow.

148
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:41,467
I mean, it's not exactly
a real library, but it's...

149
00:05:41,552 --> 00:05:43,873
Would it be okay if I did
a little sorting?

150
00:05:44,005 --> 00:05:46,146
Seems like
doctors don't put books back

151
00:05:46,232 --> 00:05:48,138
- where they found them.
- Oh, sure.

152
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:49,849
Sorry, but I have
back-to-back meetings.

153
00:05:49,935 --> 00:05:51,208
I'll come back
and grab you for lunch.

154
00:05:51,293 --> 00:05:52,412
Okay?

155
00:05:52,542 --> 00:05:54,099
My son, the chief.

156
00:05:54,216 --> 00:05:56,076
Oh, my God.
This is so cute!

157
00:05:56,162 --> 00:05:58,415
Thank you.
Those are for my grandchildren.

158
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,279
Oh!
Is Amber having another baby?

159
00:06:00,365 --> 00:06:02,638
No. Those are for yours.

160
00:06:03,466 --> 00:06:05,724
- Our... Our what?
- Kids.

161
00:06:05,928 --> 00:06:08,357
Uh, you know, I was reading
an article about how gender

162
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:10,162
is a more fluid concept than

163
00:06:10,248 --> 00:06:11,974
previous generations realized.

164
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:15,245
So I figured that purple, green...

165
00:06:15,474 --> 00:06:16,818
Neutral colors.

166
00:06:16,917 --> 00:06:18,500
Mm-hmm.

167
00:06:18,679 --> 00:06:19,913
Hm.

168
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:22,685
We're in the baby hat place?

169
00:06:22,771 --> 00:06:24,544
Are you pregnant
and you didn't tell me?

170
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:27,599
She asked me if we wanted kids,
and I said yes because we do.

171
00:06:27,685 --> 00:06:29,326
And she's making
the hats extra big

172
00:06:29,427 --> 00:06:30,865
because I had an extra big head.

173
00:06:30,989 --> 00:06:33,427
Which, now that I say it out
loud, probably sounds daunting.

174
00:06:34,135 --> 00:06:35,285
I have a surgery.

175
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:36,708
What surgery?

176
00:06:37,183 --> 00:06:38,421
Hey... Hey, Bailey.

177
00:06:38,507 --> 00:06:39,589
<i>Dr. Hobb to...</i>

178
00:06:39,674 --> 00:06:41,124
<i>Dr. Hobb...</i>

179
00:06:41,209 --> 00:06:43,037
Hunt and Altman are both
taking personal days,

180
00:06:43,123 --> 00:06:44,857
so I need you to cover the pit
today.

181
00:06:45,847 --> 00:06:46,963
Please?

182
00:06:47,048 --> 00:06:48,565
- How many?
- How many what?

183
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:50,349
- Days left.
- Till what?

184
00:06:50,435 --> 00:06:52,138
Till I stop taking orders from you.

185
00:06:52,232 --> 00:06:53,552
22.

186
00:06:53,646 --> 00:06:54,704
Mm-hmm.

187
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:56,248
<i>Dr. Oliver to Radiology.</i>

188
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:57,880
<i>Dr. Danny Oliver to Radiology.</i>

189
00:06:58,129 --> 00:06:59,771
- Maybe.
- Kidding.

190
00:06:59,931 --> 00:07:02,154
- Hey, Link!
- Hey, number 20.

191
00:07:03,665 --> 00:07:05,787
Yeah. Heh!

192
00:07:05,873 --> 00:07:07,513
All right.
Jackson Avery, plastics.

193
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:08,884
Jenny Martinez, mother.

194
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,220
- Nice to meet you.
- You I know.

195
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:12,779
Come here with that face.

196
00:07:13,352 --> 00:07:14,935
We miss you
at the clubhouse.

197
00:07:15,076 --> 00:07:16,264
You're gonna get him squared away

198
00:07:16,349 --> 00:07:17,921
so he can get called up
next year, right?

199
00:07:18,006 --> 00:07:19,256
That is the hope.

200
00:07:19,414 --> 00:07:21,037
But it's gonna be
a long road.

201
00:07:21,281 --> 00:07:22,898
Dr. Kim, all you.

202
00:07:22,991 --> 00:07:25,162
Okay.
Hunter Martinez, 20 years old,

203
00:07:25,253 --> 00:07:27,896
diagnosed with osteosarcoma
of the distal right femur,

204
00:07:27,982 --> 00:07:29,404
here for a rotation-plasty.

205
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,123
Uh, what exactly is that?

206
00:07:31,255 --> 00:07:32,742
He only told me
about this last week,

207
00:07:32,841 --> 00:07:33,966
so I'm playing catch-up.

208
00:07:34,052 --> 00:07:36,505
She worries too much.
Show her the cartoon.

209
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:38,169
Okay.

210
00:07:38,512 --> 00:07:42,138
We will begin by removing
the lower end of the femur,

211
00:07:42,237 --> 00:07:44,121
the knee joint,
and the upper tibia.

212
00:07:44,206 --> 00:07:47,424
Then rotate
the lower leg 180 degrees

213
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:49,630
and re-attach the remainder of the leg.

214
00:07:49,716 --> 00:07:51,794
The ankle joint will serve
as the new knee joint

215
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,196
to fit in for the prosthetic leg.

216
00:07:53,281 --> 00:07:54,552
Oh, my God!

217
00:07:54,638 --> 00:07:55,654
Now, don't worry, Jenny.

218
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,134
He's already done
his three months of chemo,

219
00:07:57,219 --> 00:07:58,326
so this surgery will leave him.

220
00:07:58,411 --> 00:07:59,763
- Three months?
- Cancer-free...

221
00:08:01,788 --> 00:08:03,272
You've known
about this for three months?

222
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:04,707
I didn't want to freak you out.

223
00:08:04,793 --> 00:08:06,279
Freak me out?!

224
00:08:11,214 --> 00:08:12,727
We'll, uh...

225
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:15,224
talk about this later.

226
00:08:16,196 --> 00:08:19,169
Please, um... continue.

227
00:08:19,456 --> 00:08:21,248
Okay.
Well, the first step would be

228
00:08:21,349 --> 00:08:22,787
to make an incision in the thigh.

229
00:08:22,873 --> 00:08:24,155
<i>Dr. Swan to Oncology.</i>

230
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,748
Nice to meet you,
Mr. DeLuca.

231
00:08:25,857 --> 00:08:26,940
Or should I say "Doctor"?

232
00:08:27,115 --> 00:08:28,365
It is, grazie.

233
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:30,654
Uh, bambini, you can go now.

234
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:32,457
I can help with the English.

235
00:08:32,543 --> 00:08:34,333
You?

236
00:08:34,632 --> 00:08:36,482
You can barely speak it
yourself.

237
00:08:36,568 --> 00:08:38,474
I can help.
And, plus, I'm curious to see

238
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,657
what this research is
you're presenting today.

239
00:08:41,123 --> 00:08:42,490
Okay.

240
00:08:53,095 --> 00:08:55,997
It is a baby
in a bag.

241
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:57,123
Okay.

242
00:08:57,208 --> 00:08:59,262
1 in 10 babies is born
preterm

243
00:08:59,347 --> 00:09:01,349
because mother can't
carry child to term

244
00:09:01,435 --> 00:09:04,177
due to trauma or accident,
so many reasons.

245
00:09:04,263 --> 00:09:05,746
And the baby, she dies.

246
00:09:05,832 --> 00:09:09,151
Premature babies cannot survive
outside the mama.

247
00:09:09,324 --> 00:09:11,229
But what if it could?

248
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:14,978
What if we transferred the baby
from the mama

249
00:09:15,064 --> 00:09:17,724
to an external gestational sac

250
00:09:17,866 --> 00:09:21,427
so her little lungs
and her brain and her heart,

251
00:09:21,513 --> 00:09:22,843
they can develop?

252
00:09:23,746 --> 00:09:26,935
And then
we give her the birth, yes?

253
00:09:27,179 --> 00:09:28,740
From the bag,

254
00:09:28,945 --> 00:09:33,263
a beautiful, full-term, healthy baby!

255
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:36,912
You want to create
an external gestational sac?

256
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:39,521
No. I have already.

257
00:09:42,621 --> 00:09:45,068
I am in animal trials.

258
00:09:45,974 --> 00:09:48,057
Four ovine subject subjects.

259
00:09:48,143 --> 00:09:51,263
The latest showed normal pH
and lactate levels,

260
00:09:51,404 --> 00:09:53,130
good fetal circulation,

261
00:09:53,216 --> 00:09:54,380
and then...

262
00:09:54,466 --> 00:09:55,552
<i>Eccolo!</i>

263
00:09:55,637 --> 00:09:59,623
Born at 125 days.

264
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:01,982
- That lamb gestated?
- In a bag.

265
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:04,974
It's a baby in a bag.

266
00:10:06,162 --> 00:10:07,958
You'll fund this, yes?

267
00:10:16,715 --> 00:10:20,100
Britney's signature,
her parents' signature...

268
00:10:20,326 --> 00:10:22,263
Everything's notarized.

269
00:10:22,365 --> 00:10:25,200
Well, I have good news
and bad news.

270
00:10:25,286 --> 00:10:26,341
Is something wrong?

271
00:10:26,427 --> 00:10:28,045
No. That's the good news
and the bad news.

272
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:29,426
This is so straightforward,

273
00:10:29,512 --> 00:10:30,896
I'm not gonna be able
to bill you for many hours.

274
00:10:30,981 --> 00:10:32,554
Oh.

275
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:34,512
So, let's get started
with you two.

276
00:10:34,598 --> 00:10:36,536
Uh, what is Leo's address?

277
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:41,129
Uh, trick question.

278
00:10:41,214 --> 00:10:42,489
It's really your address.

279
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:43,888
No, it's... it's not that.

280
00:10:43,973 --> 00:10:45,266
Just we don't live together.

281
00:10:45,351 --> 00:10:46,388
- We used to...
- Yeah.

282
00:10:46,552 --> 00:10:48,137
- Uh, but not anymore.
- Mnh-mnh.

283
00:10:48,825 --> 00:10:50,294
Oh.

284
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:52,981
- Is that a problem?
- Well, you tell me.

285
00:10:53,067 --> 00:10:55,068
Because if the two of you are
gonna be fighting for custody,

286
00:10:55,153 --> 00:10:55,950
- I mean, that's...
- No, no, no, no.

287
00:10:56,036 --> 00:10:57,107
Neither of... of us wants that.

288
00:10:57,192 --> 00:10:58,213
- We are totally committed to Leo...
- Yeah.

289
00:10:58,298 --> 00:11:00,839
And, um, we want what's best for him.

290
00:11:01,277 --> 00:11:02,626
Then we should be good.

291
00:11:02,864 --> 00:11:04,614
But I am gonna have to
take back what I said

292
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,254
about this not being complicated.

293
00:11:09,455 --> 00:11:10,825
Wait, wait, wait! I, uh...

294
00:11:10,911 --> 00:11:12,278
I need you
to put me on a surgery.

295
00:11:12,364 --> 00:11:13,692
- Any surgery.
- Why?

296
00:11:13,778 --> 00:11:15,856
Because I told my husband
I had a surgery.

297
00:11:15,942 --> 00:11:17,528
Got it.
What are you avoiding?

298
00:11:17,614 --> 00:11:19,747
Telling you would defeat
the purpose of avoiding it.

299
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,348
Oh, God.
Oh, what's happening? No.

300
00:11:22,434 --> 00:11:24,472
Eye contact. Oh.

301
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:26,274
God, I am so embarrassed for you both.

302
00:11:26,359 --> 00:11:28,317
We're doing a rotation-plasty, so...

303
00:11:28,403 --> 00:11:29,989
You're turning an ankle into a knee?

304
00:11:30,075 --> 00:11:31,278
- I want in.
- Okay.

305
00:11:31,387 --> 00:11:32,411
Schmitt, you're out.

306
00:11:32,497 --> 00:11:34,467
I've been studying for this
surgery for three weeks.

307
00:11:34,552 --> 00:11:36,036
- Seniority.
- Special treatment.

308
00:11:36,122 --> 00:11:37,841
Oh, yeah?
How'd you get in on it?

309
00:11:38,161 --> 00:11:39,544
Oh.

310
00:11:40,607 --> 00:11:42,323
Sorry, bud. Too many cooks.

311
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:43,880
Karev, prep the patient.

312
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:46,714
Oh, and, uh,
tell his mom where to hang.

313
00:11:46,846 --> 00:11:48,848
- She's a little freaked.
- Okay.

314
00:11:51,851 --> 00:11:53,677
Ooh, whatcha working on?

315
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:56,598
Well, Ellis came to me
last night in a dream

316
00:11:56,684 --> 00:11:58,006
and gave me the answer
to something.

317
00:11:58,091 --> 00:11:59,427
I just don't know
what the question is.

318
00:11:59,512 --> 00:12:00,559
Huh.

319
00:12:00,645 --> 00:12:02,403
Ellis got into
my head this morning, too.

320
00:12:02,497 --> 00:12:03,506
Did she give you
the question?

321
00:12:03,591 --> 00:12:04,646
No, I was doing that podcast,

322
00:12:04,731 --> 00:12:06,224
- you know, for my article...
- Uh-huh.

323
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:07,543
And I accidentally let it slip

324
00:12:07,629 --> 00:12:09,122
to the entire medical community

325
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:10,989
that I'm her secret love child.

326
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:14,605
Oh.

327
00:12:15,582 --> 00:12:17,492
Well, that's not
that big a deal.

328
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:19,707
You said, "Oh,"
and you made a face.

329
00:12:19,848 --> 00:12:21,355
Maggie, that's your life.

330
00:12:21,441 --> 00:12:22,473
Well, yeah.
And...

331
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:24,098
And yours. And Richard's.

332
00:12:26,769 --> 00:12:28,519
- Biomarkers?
- What?

333
00:12:28,629 --> 00:12:31,027
Ellis. The question.
Was it about biomarkers?

334
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:33,208
You're a genius.

335
00:12:33,488 --> 00:12:34,965
Yeah, it's in our DNA.

336
00:12:36,457 --> 00:12:38,621
- Ugh.
- Maggie, Richard will be fine.

337
00:12:38,707 --> 00:12:40,059
He's Richard.

338
00:12:41,931 --> 00:12:43,238
Okay.

339
00:12:50,009 --> 00:12:51,993
<i>Rhys Joseph to Peds ICU.</i>

340
00:12:52,215 --> 00:12:54,395
<i>Rhys Joseph to Peds ICU.</i>

341
00:13:01,321 --> 00:13:02,473
How long will that take?

342
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:03,747
It could be around eight hours,

343
00:13:03,832 --> 00:13:05,254
but we'll make sure
to update you.

344
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:06,364
And what time will that be?

345
00:13:06,449 --> 00:13:07,988
Every couple of hours.

346
00:13:09,848 --> 00:13:11,723
It's normal to be scared.

347
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,598
I'm not scared.
I'm enraged.

348
00:13:15,691 --> 00:13:17,004
This child, who I poured

349
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:19,293
my blood and sweat
and soul into...

350
00:13:19,379 --> 00:13:21,973
my child didn't tell me
about three months of chemo

351
00:13:22,059 --> 00:13:23,208
'cause he didn't want me to freak,

352
00:13:23,293 --> 00:13:25,887
so now I-I-I'm not allowed
to freak or I prove him right,

353
00:13:25,973 --> 00:13:26,887
and I'm not allowed to rage

354
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:29,058
because you're turning
his ankle into his knee,

355
00:13:29,144 --> 00:13:30,707
so I have to be supportive!

356
00:13:35,488 --> 00:13:37,980
Is there a gym
in this hospital

357
00:13:38,512 --> 00:13:40,208
with some kind of
punching bag?

358
00:13:41,598 --> 00:13:42,848
I'm sorry, Dr. Bailey.

359
00:13:42,934 --> 00:13:44,208
I was on the OR floor,

360
00:13:44,293 --> 00:13:45,346
- so it took me a minute.
- Stop, Schmitt.

361
00:13:45,431 --> 00:13:46,598
I'm bored already.

362
00:13:46,684 --> 00:13:48,777
Bed 3. Frank Nelstadt, 47.

363
00:13:48,863 --> 00:13:52,387
Chief complaint... fever,
sore throat, productive cough.

364
00:13:52,473 --> 00:13:55,290
O2 sat 88% on room air.

365
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:56,424
Enjoy.

366
00:13:56,509 --> 00:13:58,558
- It's Dad.
- I'm kinda busy, Ella.

367
00:13:58,644 --> 00:13:59,996
Mr. Nelstadt, I'm Dr. Schmitt.

368
00:14:00,082 --> 00:14:01,051
How long have you
had that cough?

369
00:14:01,137 --> 00:14:02,855
Uh, I don't know.
A few days?

370
00:14:02,941 --> 00:14:04,660
It's not as bad as it seems.

371
00:14:04,882 --> 00:14:06,165
Don't think I didn't see you

372
00:14:06,251 --> 00:14:07,730
just decline my call, honey.

373
00:14:07,863 --> 00:14:09,566
You're supposed to be
at a conference.

374
00:14:09,652 --> 00:14:12,504
I was, until
our daughter ratted you out.

375
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:14,691
"Dad hacking up lung.

376
00:14:14,777 --> 00:14:17,215
Sounds like dying moose.
So gross."

377
00:14:17,301 --> 00:14:19,871
We've raised such a sensitive
and supportive young woman.

378
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,683
Sir, do you have any chest pain?

379
00:14:22,769 --> 00:14:24,426
I'd like to get an X-ray, maybe a CT,

380
00:14:24,527 --> 00:14:26,090
just to rule out anything
more serious.

381
00:14:26,176 --> 00:14:27,848
- A CT? Really?
- Dan.

382
00:14:27,934 --> 00:14:29,424
- How old are you?
- Danny!

383
00:14:29,509 --> 00:14:32,121
Sorry, Doctor, my husband
spins out over a hangnail.

384
00:14:32,207 --> 00:14:34,527
- Dan...
- Excuse me. Hi. Are you in charge here?

385
00:14:34,621 --> 00:14:37,223
Because, uh, there's a child
doctor working on my husband,

386
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:38,622
and I would like for you
to change that.

387
00:14:38,707 --> 00:14:40,802
- Uh, Dr. Schmitt is a surgical resident.
- All right, deep breath in.

388
00:14:40,887 --> 00:14:42,083
And although he looks young, he does...

389
00:14:42,168 --> 00:14:43,809
All right, I-I'm sorry.
It's not in my nature to be rude,

390
00:14:43,894 --> 00:14:45,566
so I-I'm hoping
you're gonna forgive me

391
00:14:45,652 --> 00:14:47,684
and know that this is just
the fear talking when I say...

392
00:14:47,769 --> 00:14:50,277
if my husband needs a CT,
then I need for him

393
00:14:50,363 --> 00:14:52,313
to have a grown-ass doctor.

394
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,488
Sir, lean forward.

395
00:14:55,574 --> 00:14:57,723
Frank? Frank!
Can he breathe?

396
00:14:57,832 --> 00:14:59,551
Let's prepare for a possible RSI

397
00:14:59,637 --> 00:15:01,933
with 100 sux, 100 propofol,

398
00:15:02,019 --> 00:15:03,902
and get an intubation tray ready.

399
00:15:06,245 --> 00:15:08,029
- Oh, my God!
- Ohh.

400
00:15:08,223 --> 00:15:10,031
I do not enjoy this.

401
00:15:10,116 --> 00:15:11,499
Okay.

402
00:15:15,221 --> 00:15:16,888
Oh, that feels better.

403
00:15:18,972 --> 00:15:21,730
<i>♪ I-I-I can feel it ♪</i>

404
00:15:21,816 --> 00:15:23,519
<i>♪ I can feel it ♪</i>

405
00:15:23,605 --> 00:15:26,239
<i>♪ I can feel it ♪</i>

406
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:29,527
All right.
Upper dissection complete.

407
00:15:29,613 --> 00:15:31,371
Let's go ahead
and remove the specimen.

408
00:15:31,457 --> 00:15:32,745
We're ready
from the lower end.

409
00:15:32,831 --> 00:15:34,014
Jo, the honors?

410
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,083
Yes, please. Ohh.

411
00:15:36,222 --> 00:15:39,407
I can't believe Hunter didn't
tell his mom he had a tumor.

412
00:15:39,492 --> 00:15:41,793
Oh, he told her.
Just not till last week.

413
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:43,138
Ah, he was trying to protect her.

414
00:15:43,223 --> 00:15:44,873
Stupid, but I understand
the impulse.

415
00:15:44,998 --> 00:15:46,449
All right. Let's rotate the leg.

416
00:15:46,535 --> 00:15:47,285
Okay.

417
00:15:47,371 --> 00:15:50,218
Can you get the tibial plates
and screws ready, please?

418
00:15:50,303 --> 00:15:51,637
Speaking of parents,

419
00:15:51,723 --> 00:15:53,306
how's it going with
the mother-in-law?

420
00:15:53,392 --> 00:15:55,441
Still here.
Still sleeping on our couch.

421
00:15:55,527 --> 00:15:57,980
Oof. In a loft?
That sounds cozy.

422
00:15:58,066 --> 00:15:59,051
No, it's fine.

423
00:15:59,137 --> 00:16:01,183
She's sweet, and she doesn't
take up a lot of space,

424
00:16:01,269 --> 00:16:03,551
and she just makes tea all day,
and she knits.

425
00:16:03,637 --> 00:16:05,129
So that's what
you're avoiding.

426
00:16:05,215 --> 00:16:06,957
- No.
- Who's avoiding?

427
00:16:07,043 --> 00:16:08,567
Jo wanted to scrub
in for a distraction.

428
00:16:08,652 --> 00:16:10,394
It's not Helen.
Helen is fine.

429
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,294
I'm happy that she's here
and that she's doing well

430
00:16:12,379 --> 00:16:13,582
and that she is knitting hats.

431
00:16:13,668 --> 00:16:14,965
A lot of them.
For babies.

432
00:16:15,051 --> 00:16:17,153
For our babies, apparently,
that her and Alex are planning

433
00:16:17,238 --> 00:16:18,480
just full steam ahead...

434
00:16:18,566 --> 00:16:21,715
gender neutral, big-headed
baby hats and all.

435
00:16:21,996 --> 00:16:23,238
Lap pad.

436
00:16:23,324 --> 00:16:24,920
<i>♪ Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh ♪</i>

437
00:16:25,005 --> 00:16:27,022
I think we got what she's avoiding.

438
00:16:27,107 --> 00:16:30,606
<i>♪ Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh ♪</i>

439
00:16:30,876 --> 00:16:33,193
<i>♪ Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh ♪</i>

440
00:16:33,403 --> 00:16:35,897
- You paged me to the lab?
- I did.

441
00:16:37,384 --> 00:16:39,100
What... you couldn't come
to my office?

442
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:40,895
I couldn't.

443
00:16:41,004 --> 00:16:42,142
Why not?

444
00:16:42,227 --> 00:16:43,419
Because that would be a concession

445
00:16:43,504 --> 00:16:45,473
to your superior job title,
and that's about to end.

446
00:16:45,558 --> 00:16:46,773
But it hasn't ended.

447
00:16:46,858 --> 00:16:48,708
No, but when it does,
I just don't want the fall

448
00:16:48,793 --> 00:16:50,211
to hurt too badly.

449
00:16:50,297 --> 00:16:51,746
What are you working on?

450
00:16:52,074 --> 00:16:53,895
My mother gave me a tip.

451
00:16:54,043 --> 00:16:55,449
- About what?
- Never mind.

452
00:16:55,535 --> 00:16:57,012
How'd it go with
Vincenzo DeLuca?

453
00:16:57,098 --> 00:16:58,364
Oh, his pitch was awesome.

454
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:00,401
It's a freaking baby
in a bag.

455
00:17:01,374 --> 00:17:02,473
A baby in a bag?

456
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:03,535
Yeah, an external womb.

457
00:17:03,621 --> 00:17:04,598
He's already made a prototype.

458
00:17:04,684 --> 00:17:06,787
He showed us the video of
the baby lamb.

459
00:17:07,466 --> 00:17:08,783
- In a bag?
- Yup.

460
00:17:08,908 --> 00:17:10,567
10 years in peds,
and I have never thought

461
00:17:10,653 --> 00:17:11,832
of something so cool.

462
00:17:11,918 --> 00:17:13,668
Almost sounds too good to be true.

463
00:17:13,723 --> 00:17:15,603
Yeah, well, I asked him
to give me a day or two,

464
00:17:15,688 --> 00:17:17,381
but I wanted to say yes
in that room.

465
00:17:18,402 --> 00:17:20,215
Did you call his hospital
in Italy?

466
00:17:20,401 --> 00:17:21,969
Yeah. They love him.

467
00:17:24,715 --> 00:17:25,866
You should dig a little deeper...

468
00:17:25,951 --> 00:17:27,325
kick the tires on that one.

469
00:17:27,459 --> 00:17:29,176
Why? What do you know?

470
00:17:30,226 --> 00:17:31,343
What?

471
00:17:31,459 --> 00:17:33,004
Read my face.

472
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:35,490
Constipated?

473
00:17:35,575 --> 00:17:38,927
My face is saying something
that I cannot say.

474
00:17:39,012 --> 00:17:40,161
Oh, this is about Jo.

475
00:17:40,246 --> 00:17:41,458
Did she talk to you about my mom.

476
00:17:41,543 --> 00:17:42,320
and the baby hats?

477
00:17:42,405 --> 00:17:43,531
Oh.

478
00:17:43,707 --> 00:17:45,559
Never mind.

479
00:17:45,705 --> 00:17:46,902
Fine.

480
00:17:50,589 --> 00:17:52,332
So, are you planning
on alternating weeks

481
00:17:52,418 --> 00:17:53,341
or splitting weeks?

482
00:17:53,426 --> 00:17:54,342
2-2-3?

483
00:17:54,427 --> 00:17:55,715
2-2-3 is...?

484
00:17:55,801 --> 00:17:57,207
You each get two days,

485
00:17:57,293 --> 00:17:58,910
and then whoever went
first gets three,

486
00:17:58,996 --> 00:18:00,181
and then, the next week,
you flip it

487
00:18:00,266 --> 00:18:01,397
so the time balances out.

488
00:18:01,482 --> 00:18:02,653
Um...

489
00:18:02,946 --> 00:18:05,684
W-We haven't had much time
to discuss it, so...

490
00:18:05,861 --> 00:18:07,551
The judge is gonna want to know.

491
00:18:07,966 --> 00:18:10,176
Well, I don't want to spend
half my time away from him.

492
00:18:10,275 --> 00:18:12,043
She gave custody to both of us.

493
00:18:12,129 --> 00:18:13,969
Yeah, but she didn't know
that you'd just left me.

494
00:18:14,054 --> 00:18:15,654
Maybe she would've made
a different decision.

495
00:18:15,739 --> 00:18:17,365
Okay, so you don't even
want me on the paperwork.

496
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:18,785
No, no.
That's not what I'm saying.

497
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:21,114
I'm just saying there's
an argument to be made

498
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,637
in favor of consistency.

499
00:18:22,722 --> 00:18:24,965
Okay, folks, uh,
we're done here.

500
00:18:25,051 --> 00:18:26,740
- Uh, no, wait. We will...
- Uh.

501
00:18:26,826 --> 00:18:28,209
- We're gonna figure it out.
- "We'll figure it out"

502
00:18:28,294 --> 00:18:30,043
isn't the kind of answer
I can give a judge.

503
00:18:30,129 --> 00:18:31,678
Listen, this went longer than
expected

504
00:18:31,764 --> 00:18:34,121
and I have another meeting,
but use the room.

505
00:18:34,298 --> 00:18:35,654
If you want this child
in your life,

506
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:38,871
you're gonna need
to get on the same page, fast.

507
00:18:45,899 --> 00:18:48,020
She said,
"Dad's coughing up a lung,"

508
00:18:48,114 --> 00:18:49,564
and now he just coughed up a lung.

509
00:18:49,649 --> 00:18:51,614
It's not his lung, or he would be dead.

510
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,867
Uh, according to image search,

511
00:18:53,953 --> 00:18:55,770
it's a... a bronchial tree.

512
00:18:55,855 --> 00:18:57,699
Uh, it's actually a blood clot

513
00:18:57,785 --> 00:18:59,543
in the shape of a bronchial tree.

514
00:18:59,629 --> 00:19:01,241
Somehow, the coughing

515
00:19:01,327 --> 00:19:03,129
must've cause bleeding
in his airway,

516
00:19:03,215 --> 00:19:05,512
but how it became
so congealed and...

517
00:19:07,012 --> 00:19:08,151
- What's happening?
- Dad?

518
00:19:08,237 --> 00:19:09,341
Are you okay?

519
00:19:09,426 --> 00:19:11,953
Okay. Schmitt, intubate
while I do an ultrasound.

520
00:19:12,038 --> 00:19:13,559
Um, I'm sorry.
Move back, please.

521
00:19:13,645 --> 00:19:15,559
Let's get a crash cart in here

522
00:19:15,645 --> 00:19:17,361
and the sux and propofol
that I asked for

523
00:19:17,446 --> 00:19:18,598
and an EKG.

524
00:19:18,684 --> 00:19:20,128
What happened?
He was just fine!

525
00:19:20,213 --> 00:19:21,473
Dad, come on. Let them work.

526
00:19:21,559 --> 00:19:22,708
Come on, let's move, Schmitt.

527
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:26,496
This could be a massive
pulmonary embolus.

528
00:19:27,228 --> 00:19:28,988
You ever hear
an idea that's so good

529
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:30,973
that it makes you angry
you didn't think of it?

530
00:19:31,413 --> 00:19:32,830
Yes.

531
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:35,101
But it usually means
my meds aren't working.

532
00:19:35,595 --> 00:19:38,223
I spent several years
in an outright rage

533
00:19:38,309 --> 00:19:40,949
that I didn't invent
the cordless phone.

534
00:19:42,668 --> 00:19:44,486
When I was little,
what did you think I was gonna be

535
00:19:44,571 --> 00:19:45,887
when I grew up?

536
00:19:46,579 --> 00:19:48,691
Well, you once asked me

537
00:19:48,777 --> 00:19:51,230
what the inside of a doorknob
looked like.

538
00:19:51,347 --> 00:19:52,539
I mean, you were 6,

539
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:54,229
so I just took it apart
and showed it to you.

540
00:19:54,314 --> 00:19:57,333
But then you wouldn't let me
put it back together again.

541
00:19:57,657 --> 00:19:59,233
Eventually, you did it yourself,

542
00:19:59,319 --> 00:20:02,238
so I thought you were
gonna be an engineer.

543
00:20:02,637 --> 00:20:04,191
Oh, yeah, well,
taking things apart

544
00:20:04,277 --> 00:20:05,606
and putting them back
together again

545
00:20:05,691 --> 00:20:07,340
is kind of what I do all day.

546
00:20:07,592 --> 00:20:09,089
That's true.

547
00:20:09,362 --> 00:20:11,301
But I'm not really a thinker.

548
00:20:12,488 --> 00:20:15,855
I mean, I'm a fixer, not an innovator.

549
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:18,742
Oh, I don't know about that,
honey.

550
00:20:19,037 --> 00:20:22,535
I've never been anything
but in awe of your brain.

551
00:20:22,746 --> 00:20:23,863
God knows where you got it,

552
00:20:23,949 --> 00:20:26,178
'cause you didn't get it
from either of your parents.

553
00:20:27,433 --> 00:20:31,019
You know, you really freaked out
Jo with those baby hats.

554
00:20:31,139 --> 00:20:33,416
Well, I didn't mean
to freak her out. I...

555
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:35,965
Give her a little nudge, maybe.

556
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:42,089
<i>Chris Boddam to Admitting.</i>

557
00:20:42,213 --> 00:20:43,840
<i>Chris Boddam to Admitting.</i>

558
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:46,618
Mm. Okay. Thanks.

559
00:20:46,711 --> 00:20:48,941
Why do I have
a request for a comment

560
00:20:49,027 --> 00:20:51,219
on the "Maggie Pierce/ Ellis Grey" story?

561
00:20:51,304 --> 00:20:53,058
Oh, my God, Richard.
I'm so sorry.

562
00:20:53,144 --> 00:20:55,223
I was doing that podcast,
and we started talking about

563
00:20:55,308 --> 00:20:56,824
how I got into surgery and
genetics, and then suddenly...

564
00:20:56,909 --> 00:20:59,060
You were telling the entire
medical community

565
00:20:59,145 --> 00:21:00,918
that Ellis and I had an affair?

566
00:21:01,826 --> 00:21:04,344
Richard, I'm so sorry.

567
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:05,679
I-I-I didn't think...

568
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:07,349
No, you didn't.

569
00:21:16,229 --> 00:21:19,527
Thank you. All right.
Neurovascular bundle

570
00:21:19,613 --> 00:21:21,910
seems to be intact
and tension-free.

571
00:21:21,996 --> 00:21:23,413
Blood flow looks nice.

572
00:21:23,499 --> 00:21:24,943
And I'm liking the bone alignment.

573
00:21:25,028 --> 00:21:26,691
- Nico, we good?
- Beautiful.

574
00:21:26,777 --> 00:21:28,861
Excellent. Rounding third.

575
00:21:28,997 --> 00:21:30,363
So, what's up with Karev?

576
00:21:30,449 --> 00:21:31,559
He wants a kid and you don't?

577
00:21:31,644 --> 00:21:32,885
Well, I thought
I did someday...

578
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:35,386
until someday started
sounding like <i>today.</i>

579
00:21:35,472 --> 00:21:37,590
Well, I can tell you
that it's not all bad.

580
00:21:37,676 --> 00:21:38,660
I mean, Harriet right now

581
00:21:38,746 --> 00:21:40,231
is learning how to pronounce
her "K" words,

582
00:21:40,316 --> 00:21:41,894
which sound more like T's.

583
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:43,879
So she's got a little friend
named Coco...

584
00:21:43,965 --> 00:21:45,293
she calls her Toto.

585
00:21:45,402 --> 00:21:46,997
And it's got to be
the cutest thing ever.

586
00:21:47,082 --> 00:21:48,786
Right, but does the cute
outweigh the terror?

587
00:21:48,871 --> 00:21:51,129
- The what?
- You know, all that potential heartache.

588
00:21:51,215 --> 00:21:53,465
Little humans with giant heads
who are gonna get hurt

589
00:21:53,566 --> 00:21:54,926
and picked on
and have nightmares

590
00:21:55,012 --> 00:21:56,230
and wonder
why they were born.

591
00:21:56,316 --> 00:21:57,176
And even when
they're grown up,

592
00:21:57,262 --> 00:21:58,644
you never stop
worrying about them.

593
00:21:58,848 --> 00:21:59,891
I mean, look at Hunter.

594
00:22:00,051 --> 00:22:01,653
He's a freaking
major league

595
00:22:01,738 --> 00:22:03,067
- baseball player...
- Minor league.

596
00:22:03,152 --> 00:22:06,215
Top of his game, the best genes,
and out of nowhere, cancer.

597
00:22:06,301 --> 00:22:08,207
And now his mom is having
a nervous breakdown,

598
00:22:08,293 --> 00:22:09,824
all because
she made the choice

599
00:22:09,926 --> 00:22:11,441
to ruin her life
with a child.

600
00:22:12,499 --> 00:22:13,699
No offense.

601
00:22:13,862 --> 00:22:15,910
Why would I possibly
be offended?

602
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:18,074
Irrigation, please.

603
00:22:19,269 --> 00:22:21,333
So, on the days we trade,

604
00:22:21,479 --> 00:22:23,144
one of us will drop him off
at daycare

605
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:24,317
and the other one will pick him up?

606
00:22:24,402 --> 00:22:26,505
Yeah.
That makes sense.

607
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:28,359
Okay. Done.

608
00:22:28,719 --> 00:22:29,980
Huh.

609
00:22:30,955 --> 00:22:33,691
You know this will probably
all go out the window

610
00:22:33,777 --> 00:22:34,777
once Teddy has her baby.

611
00:22:34,863 --> 00:22:36,317
You're not gonna know
your 2s from your 3s.

612
00:22:36,402 --> 00:22:37,973
Well,
Teddy is with Koracick now,

613
00:22:38,058 --> 00:22:40,619
and they're on their babymoon
in Palm Springs.

614
00:22:40,704 --> 00:22:41,858
I still don't know what that is.

615
00:22:41,943 --> 00:22:44,215
Owen, this is not the time
for Teddy feelings.

616
00:22:44,301 --> 00:22:45,605
W... It's not a feeling.

617
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:47,138
- It's more of...
- Okay, still not the time for it.

618
00:22:47,223 --> 00:22:48,254
Yeah, okay.

619
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:50,527
Yeah. I'm gonna
text the lawyer

620
00:22:50,613 --> 00:22:53,144
and let her know that
we made a plan.

621
00:22:59,222 --> 00:23:00,855
Amelia.

622
00:23:01,072 --> 00:23:02,489
I don't just want you in Leo's life.

623
00:23:02,574 --> 00:23:04,291
I want you in mine.

624
00:23:04,785 --> 00:23:05,911
Let's not do this.

625
00:23:05,996 --> 00:23:07,324
I chose you.

626
00:23:07,495 --> 00:23:09,102
I choose you.

627
00:23:09,257 --> 00:23:10,464
That's never changed.

628
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:12,784
Yeah, it did change.
Everything changed.

629
00:23:12,869 --> 00:23:15,567
Things went bad
when Betty went missing

630
00:23:15,653 --> 00:23:17,388
and we thought that
we'd lost Leo, but...

631
00:23:17,474 --> 00:23:20,505
- Amelia, we... now...
- Owen, stop.

632
00:23:21,668 --> 00:23:23,961
It changed with Teddy.
That's when it changed.

633
00:23:24,047 --> 00:23:25,931
And I know that this is messy
and it's painful

634
00:23:26,016 --> 00:23:27,899
and it's not what you wanted,

635
00:23:27,984 --> 00:23:29,138
and that is no one's fault.

636
00:23:29,224 --> 00:23:32,297
But breaking up with you was
a moment of clarity for me.

637
00:23:32,806 --> 00:23:34,433
And it hurts,

638
00:23:34,919 --> 00:23:37,075
but it hurts
less than the alternative.

639
00:23:40,197 --> 00:23:41,444
Well, you can have your clarity,

640
00:23:41,529 --> 00:23:43,048
if that's what you want to call it.

641
00:23:43,617 --> 00:23:45,278
This is not no one's fault.

642
00:23:46,774 --> 00:23:48,257
This is your fault.

643
00:23:48,405 --> 00:23:49,648
What?

644
00:23:50,073 --> 00:23:52,291
"The clarity hurts less
than the alternative"?

645
00:23:52,376 --> 00:23:53,859
The alternative is loving me.

646
00:23:53,944 --> 00:23:55,559
The alternative is letting me love you,

647
00:23:55,645 --> 00:23:57,197
but you just can't do it.

648
00:23:57,797 --> 00:23:59,514
You have to just sabotage it.

649
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:02,433
I tried to convince myself that
this was all the brain tumor,

650
00:24:02,519 --> 00:24:05,437
but, apparently, there's just
some fundamental part of you

651
00:24:05,522 --> 00:24:07,005
that can't love or be loved.

652
00:24:13,057 --> 00:24:14,974
Did I hear we've got a plan?

653
00:24:19,903 --> 00:24:21,553
- "Heepsters."
<i>- Hipsters,</i> Papa.

654
00:24:21,638 --> 00:24:23,372
It's my new English word.

655
00:24:23,828 --> 00:24:27,213
They're making a statement
that they are unique, yes?

656
00:24:27,377 --> 00:24:30,028
Yeah, by dressing exactly the same.

657
00:24:30,113 --> 00:24:32,064
- Papa... <i>Speaking Italian.</i>..
- Please.

658
00:24:32,149 --> 00:24:34,533
In English. So I can practice.

659
00:24:34,724 --> 00:24:36,255
<i>Va bene.</i>

660
00:24:36,453 --> 00:24:38,177
Papa, this research really
is incredible.

661
00:24:38,263 --> 00:24:39,950
- Yes, it is, my boy.
- But we need...

662
00:24:40,036 --> 00:24:42,954
And you... your life is incredible.

663
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,207
Your city is incredible.

664
00:24:44,293 --> 00:24:46,372
I'm so proud of you.

665
00:24:48,293 --> 00:24:49,409
Thank you.

666
00:24:49,495 --> 00:24:51,895
But... how are you?

667
00:24:52,284 --> 00:24:54,379
- Really. Because Carina seems to think...
- Ay,

668
00:24:54,481 --> 00:24:56,154
Carina. Ay.

669
00:24:56,239 --> 00:24:57,981
She's like your mother.

670
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:01,083
She worries. She controls.

671
00:25:01,478 --> 00:25:03,122
You are like me.

672
00:25:03,258 --> 00:25:05,676
You know
a good idea when you hear one.

673
00:25:05,816 --> 00:25:07,616
Carina worries
for good reason.

674
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:12,481
It hasn't been easy between us,
I know.

675
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:14,739
Your mother come
between us...

676
00:25:14,825 --> 00:25:18,599
- My mother has nothing to do with this.
- Andrea, let me finish.

677
00:25:20,784 --> 00:25:23,474
You move away
from me with Mama.

678
00:25:24,167 --> 00:25:26,380
Then you stay away
for college.

679
00:25:26,466 --> 00:25:28,192
And now residency.

680
00:25:29,073 --> 00:25:31,255
You are distance.

681
00:25:31,848 --> 00:25:34,701
And I know some part is my fault.

682
00:25:34,997 --> 00:25:37,099
Let me make good.

683
00:25:38,124 --> 00:25:40,598
Andrea,
you do this with me,

684
00:25:40,684 --> 00:25:42,231
I put you in the map!

685
00:25:42,519 --> 00:25:43,794
<i>On</i> the map.

686
00:25:43,989 --> 00:25:46,849
On the map, yes!

687
00:25:47,047 --> 00:25:50,099
Look at you. You are a man,
all on your own.

688
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:52,895
A good man, too.
I see that.

689
00:25:53,155 --> 00:25:55,139
And handsome like me.

690
00:25:55,225 --> 00:25:56,724
I see you.

691
00:25:56,945 --> 00:26:00,067
But this woman of yours,
she is beyond you.

692
00:26:00,303 --> 00:26:01,560
Wow. Thank you.

693
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:05,165
Andrea, even I have
heard of Meredith Grey

694
00:26:05,251 --> 00:26:07,101
all the way back home.

695
00:26:07,187 --> 00:26:08,513
She's more than a beauty...

696
00:26:08,599 --> 00:26:09,802
she is brilliance.

697
00:26:09,888 --> 00:26:11,138
Yeah, I'm aware.

698
00:26:11,224 --> 00:26:13,341
So, then,

699
00:26:13,614 --> 00:26:15,474
we change the world together.

700
00:26:15,646 --> 00:26:17,730
We save the babies.

701
00:26:18,041 --> 00:26:20,716
My son, I owe you this.

702
00:26:20,853 --> 00:26:23,606
Let me put you on the map.

703
00:26:24,507 --> 00:26:25,557
Huh?

704
00:26:25,729 --> 00:26:27,312
<i>What can I get you?</i>

705
00:26:28,622 --> 00:26:31,325
- Mm-hmm.
- Easy. Yeah, easy.

706
00:26:31,535 --> 00:26:34,286
So, it uses the ultrasound
to drive the clot busters

707
00:26:34,371 --> 00:26:35,958
directly into the clot?

708
00:26:36,178 --> 00:26:37,841
Not bad for a child doctor.

709
00:26:37,927 --> 00:26:39,043
What?

710
00:26:39,129 --> 00:26:40,357
Nothing.

711
00:26:40,443 --> 00:26:44,185
Um, less of a chance
of intracranial bleeding.

712
00:26:44,271 --> 00:26:47,317
The TPA will release
over the next 12 hours,

713
00:26:47,403 --> 00:26:48,967
and... boom.

714
00:26:49,052 --> 00:26:51,669
No more creepy-looking
blood clots for you, Frank.

715
00:26:51,755 --> 00:26:52,966
Thank you for saying that,

716
00:26:53,052 --> 00:26:54,974
because I thought
I was the only one.

717
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:58,036
I almost forgot I was
a doctor there for a minute.

718
00:26:58,122 --> 00:26:59,605
Right?

719
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:02,638
Now we have to figure out why

720
00:27:02,724 --> 00:27:04,282
he's had two major blood clots

721
00:27:04,367 --> 00:27:06,136
over the last 24 hours.

722
00:27:06,903 --> 00:27:09,309
All right. Almost finished up here.

723
00:27:09,395 --> 00:27:11,356
Looking good.
Let's update his mom.

724
00:27:11,644 --> 00:27:13,185
Where are they?

725
00:27:14,864 --> 00:27:17,005
They're closing.

726
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:21,989
You're mad.

727
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:24,497
No, I'm not mad.

728
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:26,497
It's your story,

729
00:27:26,583 --> 00:27:28,373
and you have a right to tell it.

730
00:27:28,458 --> 00:27:30,778
Okay. Right words.

731
00:27:31,059 --> 00:27:32,469
Wrong tone.

732
00:27:33,292 --> 00:27:36,027
It is my story, and I do have
a right to tell it.

733
00:27:37,652 --> 00:27:40,300
Catherine has cancer.
She's living with cancer.

734
00:27:40,386 --> 00:27:41,469
Yeah, I know that.

735
00:27:41,555 --> 00:27:44,497
And what I think she maybe
doesn't need added to her plate

736
00:27:44,583 --> 00:27:45,390
at this moment

737
00:27:45,475 --> 00:27:47,209
is the world knowing that her hus...

738
00:27:48,745 --> 00:27:51,696
that her husband is an adulterer.

739
00:27:51,781 --> 00:27:53,198
I'm... I'm confused.

740
00:27:53,283 --> 00:27:54,699
Are you cheating on Catherine?

741
00:27:54,784 --> 00:27:57,435
- Huh? Don't be obtuse.
- I am not trying to be.

742
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,505
I had an affair with Ellis,
which you just made public.

743
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:02,864
And you think that that
somehow reflects on Catherine?

744
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:05,813
Well, it's not part of my story
I'm particularly proud of.

745
00:28:14,733 --> 00:28:16,380
It's the part of your story

746
00:28:16,466 --> 00:28:18,481
that culminated in me, Richard...

747
00:28:18,846 --> 00:28:20,429
in my existence.

748
00:28:28,122 --> 00:28:29,601
<i>Speaking Italian...</i>

749
00:28:35,025 --> 00:28:36,200
Hey.

750
00:28:36,286 --> 00:28:37,770
Hi.

751
00:28:37,856 --> 00:28:39,333
Everything okay?

752
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,020
My sister is trying to shut down
my father's research project.

753
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:46,122
She knows. And she speaks
Italian, so it's okay.

754
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:47,450
Only a little.

755
00:28:47,536 --> 00:28:49,499
Andrea,
we cannot let him do this.

756
00:28:49,584 --> 00:28:51,599
Wait, you want your father
to do research here?

757
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:53,567
Yes. I-I think it's a good idea.

758
00:28:54,224 --> 00:28:56,567
I thought you said he has
an untreated mental illness.

759
00:28:56,653 --> 00:28:58,458
- He does.
- He has episodes, okay?

760
00:28:58,544 --> 00:29:00,261
But it's not like
he's dangerous.

761
00:29:00,417 --> 00:29:01,934
Until he is.

762
00:29:02,036 --> 00:29:03,122
It's complicated.

763
00:29:03,208 --> 00:29:05,192
No, it's not complicated,
Andrea.

764
00:29:05,321 --> 00:29:06,942
He didn't even train in this field.

765
00:29:07,028 --> 00:29:08,907
Yeah, but you did.
So you know better than anyone

766
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:10,162
how important this research is.

767
00:29:10,247 --> 00:29:12,176
Right, but I also know
better than anyone

768
00:29:12,262 --> 00:29:13,612
just how bad he can get.

769
00:29:13,697 --> 00:29:15,700
Andrea, I spent the last
three months with him.

770
00:29:15,786 --> 00:29:16,902
He's not well.

771
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:18,406
You didn't grow up with him,

772
00:29:18,492 --> 00:29:20,184
so when he comes calling,
you go running.

773
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:21,286
And he knows that.

774
00:29:21,372 --> 00:29:24,325
He knows he can manipulate you,
and you're letting him.

775
00:29:24,767 --> 00:29:26,130
I'm signing on to participate

776
00:29:26,216 --> 00:29:27,880
in a groundbreaking medical study

777
00:29:27,966 --> 00:29:30,442
that could change
and save a lot of lives.

778
00:29:30,659 --> 00:29:32,142
Excuse me.

779
00:29:36,192 --> 00:29:38,669
What would you do if you were me?

780
00:29:39,923 --> 00:29:41,792
Talk to the chief?

781
00:29:43,205 --> 00:29:44,426
Hm.

782
00:29:50,217 --> 00:29:52,267
<i>Dr. Harrington to the OR.</i>

783
00:29:52,353 --> 00:29:55,638
<i>Dr. Paige Harrington to the OR.</i>

784
00:29:55,855 --> 00:29:57,310
Did you know?

785
00:29:57,848 --> 00:29:59,107
I know a lot of things.

786
00:29:59,193 --> 00:30:00,856
You'll have to be more specific.

787
00:30:01,051 --> 00:30:03,244
About DeLuca's dad and the mania

788
00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:05,130
and the four patients.

789
00:30:05,497 --> 00:30:06,810
I did.

790
00:30:06,996 --> 00:30:08,148
You could've told me.

791
00:30:08,234 --> 00:30:10,786
I did. I said dig deeper,
read my face.

792
00:30:10,871 --> 00:30:12,288
You could've just told me.

793
00:30:12,442 --> 00:30:14,790
No, I couldn't
because I was confided in

794
00:30:14,875 --> 00:30:17,505
by somebody
I care quite a bit about.

795
00:30:17,692 --> 00:30:19,454
So, no, I couldn't.

796
00:30:20,253 --> 00:30:22,841
I don't want to be the guy who
says no to something amazing

797
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:24,989
because of a little mental illness.

798
00:30:25,177 --> 00:30:26,622
I mean, look at my mom.

799
00:30:26,708 --> 00:30:29,427
Have you thought about
the ethical ramifications

800
00:30:29,513 --> 00:30:31,107
if this got into the wrong hands?

801
00:30:31,192 --> 00:30:32,834
Honestly, if it wasn't
for the guy's history,

802
00:30:32,919 --> 00:30:34,450
I wouldn't even think twice.

803
00:30:35,262 --> 00:30:37,146
Does that mean
you're going to approve it?

804
00:30:37,231 --> 00:30:39,192
Mer, it's a womb
outside the mother.

805
00:30:39,294 --> 00:30:40,513
If he pulls this off,

806
00:30:40,614 --> 00:30:43,145
it's an honest-to-God medical miracle.

807
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:47,716
Sorry you had
to grow up like that, man.

808
00:30:49,825 --> 00:30:51,160
You told him?

809
00:30:51,369 --> 00:30:52,703
Carina did.

810
00:30:54,308 --> 00:30:56,142
But I told her to.

811
00:30:57,786 --> 00:30:59,911
Mer, he's my dad.

812
00:31:00,386 --> 00:31:02,130
I'm telling you,
I think he's okay.

813
00:31:02,216 --> 00:31:04,177
I know, but, listen,

814
00:31:04,263 --> 00:31:06,294
I have my own complicated
history with my parents,

815
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:10,613
and I know that my judgment
was very often clouded.

816
00:31:10,824 --> 00:31:13,615
I need you to try
to trust me on this, okay?

817
00:31:19,575 --> 00:31:21,524
<i>Dr. Thatcher to ICU.</i>

818
00:31:21,609 --> 00:31:24,044
<i>- Dr. Rachel Thatcher to ICU.
- Hey.</i>

819
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:25,528
He's okay.

820
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:27,731
We're moving him
to an ICU room,

821
00:31:27,817 --> 00:31:30,099
and we were able to place
the catheter

822
00:31:30,185 --> 00:31:31,300
to break up the clot.

823
00:31:31,385 --> 00:31:33,325
Oh, my God, Frank.

824
00:31:33,411 --> 00:31:35,599
We ran some tests,
and we think he has something

825
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:37,273
called Factor V Leiden.

826
00:31:37,358 --> 00:31:39,475
It's a blood-clotting disorder

827
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:42,153
that can lead to
an abnormal amount of clots.

828
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:44,106
- How did he get that?
- It's genetic.

829
00:31:44,198 --> 00:31:45,627
He's had it his entire life.

830
00:31:45,712 --> 00:31:48,427
It just didn't cause any issues
until he became so sick.

831
00:31:48,569 --> 00:31:50,911
His cough may have actually
saved his life.

832
00:31:51,028 --> 00:31:52,544
He could've died?

833
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:53,669
Well, yes.

834
00:31:53,755 --> 00:31:55,599
But we were able
to get to it in time.

835
00:31:55,692 --> 00:31:57,622
And it's genetic?

836
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:59,044
Dad, what are you...

837
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:01,297
Okay, you need to test her
right away.

838
00:32:01,382 --> 00:32:03,466
Wait. I thought you said
you and Dad didn't know

839
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,216
which of you was my biological father?

840
00:32:05,302 --> 00:32:07,270
We don't.
We never wanted to know,

841
00:32:07,356 --> 00:32:09,849
and we always said
that we would only find out

842
00:32:09,935 --> 00:32:11,411
- if you wanted to.
- Which I don't.

843
00:32:11,505 --> 00:32:14,176
But if it's any chance that
you have this Factor V thing,

844
00:32:14,261 --> 00:32:15,644
we need to find out.

845
00:32:25,702 --> 00:32:26,952
Hey.

846
00:32:27,038 --> 00:32:30,479
I said a crappy thing,
and I'm sorry.

847
00:32:30,791 --> 00:32:32,061
Harriet's incredible,

848
00:32:32,146 --> 00:32:34,971
and I know that not all kids
ruin everyone's lives.

849
00:32:35,057 --> 00:32:37,399
They're sleep-depriving,
sticky little monsters

850
00:32:37,721 --> 00:32:39,463
that demand snacks endlessly

851
00:32:39,588 --> 00:32:41,120
and want you to sing
"Row Row Row Your Boat" to them

852
00:32:41,205 --> 00:32:42,538
50 times a day.

853
00:32:42,682 --> 00:32:45,850
But they also think everything
you say is hilarious.

854
00:32:46,533 --> 00:32:48,705
And when they lay their head
on your shoulder...

855
00:32:50,557 --> 00:32:52,348
Everything seems right.

856
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:54,455
Yeah, kids can ruin your life.

857
00:32:54,939 --> 00:32:57,643
But they also give you
a reason to live when...

858
00:32:58,206 --> 00:32:59,713
when life tries to ruin you.

859
00:33:07,635 --> 00:33:09,596
Now, I don't want
to get panicky phone calls

860
00:33:09,682 --> 00:33:11,283
when this takes time, okay?

861
00:33:11,369 --> 00:33:13,682
It always does.
It's the nature of the beast.

862
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:15,518
But I think
you two are in great shape.

863
00:33:15,603 --> 00:33:16,807
Thank you.

864
00:33:17,768 --> 00:33:20,176
I need to make a change.
I'm sorry. Um.

865
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:22,890
I don't think I should be
on the paperwork.

866
00:33:23,224 --> 00:33:25,033
Amelia, what are you doing?

867
00:33:27,976 --> 00:33:31,166
I'll be in his life
because Betty wants me to.

868
00:33:31,262 --> 00:33:34,480
Um, I'll see him as much
as you'll let me.

869
00:33:34,675 --> 00:33:36,416
I can be his friend. I can help.

870
00:33:36,775 --> 00:33:40,197
I will be Auntie Amelia,

871
00:33:41,264 --> 00:33:43,205
who is fundamentally incapable of love.

872
00:33:43,291 --> 00:33:45,334
Hey, hey. Come on.

873
00:33:45,525 --> 00:33:47,436
We're over, Owen.

874
00:33:47,635 --> 00:33:49,305
So this is what's best for him.

875
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:51,908
