I never told him
to call Ben "Dad."

that you are Tuck's father.

And now Tucker's hurt,

82
00:03:05,718 --> 00:03:07,193
- and Ben is oblivious...
- Thanks...

83
00:03:07,281 --> 00:03:09,208
And, somehow,
it's all my problem.

84
00:03:09,296 --> 00:03:11,591
Are you asking my opinion
about all of this?

85
00:03:11,693 --> 00:03:14,099
I would way rather give
my opinion about your life.

86
00:03:14,202 --> 00:03:15,276
Hmm.

87
00:03:15,364 --> 00:03:16,185
In that case,

88
00:03:16,273 --> 00:03:18,575
how did you tell Tuck when
you started dating Ben?

89
00:03:18,663 --> 00:03:20,206
Is this about
you and DeLuca?

90
00:03:20,551 --> 00:03:22,403

00:03:24,099 --> 00:03:25,747

00:03:25,835 --> 00:03:27,224
Who? Richard?

94
00:03:27,312 --> 00:03:28,691
Well,
the man's very chatty.

95
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,083
So, Zola actually saw him
last night at the house

96
00:03:33,179 --> 00:03:35,474
before I had a chance
to talk to her, so it was...

97
00:03:35,623 --> 00:03:36,809
- She's back.
- Oh.

98
00:03:36,897 --> 00:03:38,567
- What?
- Jo's back. She's here.

99
00:03:38,655 --> 00:03:40,747
Oh, and here, I thought
she might be dead, or...

100
00:03:40,835 --> 00:03:42,152
Don't do that.
Don't give a speech about

101
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:43,146
how you thought
she was dead

102
00:03:43,234 --> 00:03:45,233
or lost a limb or left me
or whatever, all right?

103
00:03:45,321 --> 00:03:46,794
She's not okay,
and I don't know why.

104
00:03:46,882 --> 00:03:48,817
Just don't be Bailey
about it, please.

105
00:03:53,475 --> 00:03:54,850
Dr. Karev.

106
00:03:56,887 --> 00:03:58,260
Welcome back.

107
00:03:59,546 --> 00:04:01,049
I'll be in the lab.

108
00:04:06,883 --> 00:04:09,772
That was way worse than if
you had been Bailey about it.

109
00:04:09,992 --> 00:04:12,233
- Mnh.
- Mm-hmm.

111
00:04:14,857 --> 00:04:17,038

112
00:04:17,126 --> 00:04:18,249
It's ready.

113
00:04:18,452 --> 00:04:19,479
So, it's happening?

114
00:04:19,567 --> 00:04:20,481
It's happening.

115
00:04:20,568 --> 00:04:21,515
Can we tell them?

116
00:04:21,633 --> 00:04:23,717
W-We can tell them, but try to
contain your wagging tail

117
00:04:23,804 --> 00:04:25,445
because this could be nothing
and could do nothing.

118
00:04:25,532 --> 00:04:27,562
We don't want to bait them
with false hope. It's cruel.

119
00:04:27,649 --> 00:04:29,256
Right.
Just hang on.

120
00:04:29,344 --> 00:04:30,450
What?

121
00:04:30,538 --> 00:04:32,506
I need to wag my tail
for a second out here.

122
00:04:33,058 --> 00:04:34,898
Man, I hope this is not nothing.

123
00:04:36,141 --> 00:04:37,459
Me, too.

124
00:04:39,092 --> 00:04:41,700
So, wait, you're saying my mom
might be able to use her arms again?

125
00:04:41,787 --> 00:04:43,054
We're saying
there's a clinical trial

126
00:04:43,141 --> 00:04:45,593
with stem cells being directly
injected into the cervical spine.

127
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,421
That's turning quadriplegics
into paraplegics.

128
00:04:47,508 --> 00:04:48,751
That's...
That's what you said.

129
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:50,452
In some cases, yes.

130
00:04:50,737 --> 00:04:52,045
We just need
your approval,

131
00:04:52,133 --> 00:04:54,507
and then we can get started as
soon as the stem cells arrive.

132
00:04:54,594 --> 00:04:56,014
Mom?

133
00:04:56,912 --> 00:04:58,858
Yes.
Yes, please.

134
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,615
Are you nervous?

135
00:05:03,703 --> 00:05:05,592

every job interview.

136
00:05:05,724 --> 00:05:06,826

00:05:06,914 --> 00:05:09,537
So arrogant.
I love it.

138
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:11,202
But why
San Francisco?

139
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:13,444
My fellowship year
is almost up.

140
00:05:13,532 --> 00:05:15,074
I have to interview at places before I...
No, I'm saying there's

141
00:05:15,161 --> 00:05:17,194
a lot of
excellent jobs right here.

142
00:05:17,412 --> 00:05:19,155
And I hear
the weather is worse

143
00:05:19,243 --> 00:05:20,827
in San Francisco than
it is in Seattle,

144
00:05:20,915 --> 00:05:21,980
and the rent
is triple.

145
00:05:22,068 --> 00:05:24,655
And... hills.

146
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,467
You're on my vertebroplasty
today, right?

147
00:05:31,295 --> 00:05:32,560
I'll see you there.

148
00:05:33,774 --> 00:05:35,405
And the sports teams!

149
00:05:35,493 --> 00:05:37,348
Seattle has
better sports teams!

150
00:05:37,436 --> 00:05:38,756
I'm guessing.

151
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:40,602
It's a bowel obstruction.

152
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:42,241
I know the symptoms.
I have IBD.

153
00:05:42,329 --> 00:05:43,951
I've had three obstructions
and three surgeries.

154
00:05:44,038 --> 00:05:45,454
All right,
what are your symptoms?

155
00:05:45,542 --> 00:05:48,084
Pain, bloating, cramping...
Bowel obstruction symptoms.

156
00:05:48,172 --> 00:05:49,457
- Ow!
- Okay,

157
00:05:49,545 --> 00:05:50,835
I'd love to take
your word for it,

158
00:05:50,922 --> 00:05:53,225
- but I have to get you a...
- Get a CT. Yeah, I know.

159
00:05:53,313 --> 00:05:54,498
Can you just
order it, please?

160
00:05:54,586 --> 00:05:55,647
It really hurts.

161
00:05:55,735 --> 00:05:57,202
Okay.

162
00:05:57,881 --> 00:05:59,100
Dr. DeLuca?

163
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,223
Yeah?

164
00:06:03,492 --> 00:06:06,100
Uh, I have a patient
who's...

165
00:06:06,188 --> 00:06:08,366
- Are you a doctor?
- Uh, I am, yes,

166
00:06:08,454 --> 00:06:10,046
but I'm gonna need you to
check in with her first, okay?

167
00:06:10,133 --> 00:06:14,569
I-I just had a little trouble
puttin' on my shoes.

168
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:16,952
- Oh. Oh.
- Oh.

169
00:06:18,393 --> 00:06:20,465
Yeah, maybe you should
help her first.

170
00:06:26,459 --> 00:06:28,919
I see a small
pericardial effusion.

171
00:06:29,021 --> 00:06:30,491
The shoes were new.

172
00:06:30,579 --> 00:06:31,912
I went dancing.

173
00:06:32,006 --> 00:06:35,905
A little underground club
I was supposedly too old for.

174
00:06:36,264 --> 00:06:38,687
Had a few shots
too many.

175
00:06:39,387 --> 00:06:42,796
And I took off my shoes to walk
up the stairs to my apartment,

176
00:06:42,884 --> 00:06:45,257
and... that's all
I remember.

177
00:06:45,345 --> 00:06:46,733
You slept like this?

178
00:06:46,821 --> 00:06:48,125
Oh, crap.

179
00:06:48,212 --> 00:06:49,343
Gemma?

180
00:06:49,431 --> 00:06:51,616
Uh, excuse me.
You two know each other?

181
00:06:51,819 --> 00:06:53,265
Um...

182
00:06:54,092 --> 00:06:56,715
Through, um,
a mutual friend.

183
00:06:57,146 --> 00:06:59,085
Well, Ollie isn't
around anymore,

184
00:06:59,173 --> 00:07:01,046
so thank you
for your concern,

185
00:07:01,134 --> 00:07:03,877
but, as you can see,
I'm... I'm all set here.

186
00:07:04,153 --> 00:07:05,530
Gemma,
how did this happen?

187
00:07:05,618 --> 00:07:08,147
I think you and I both know
how this happened.

188
00:07:13,191 --> 00:07:16,655
Josh Sterman, 21,
has hereditary osteoporosis

189
00:07:16,743 --> 00:07:18,294
that caused
a compression fracture

190
00:07:18,382 --> 00:07:19,952
at T-11 to T-12,

191
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,363
scheduled for
a percutaneous vertebroplasty.

192
00:07:22,451 --> 00:07:25,358
I'll inject cement right here
into the vertebral body

193
00:07:25,446 --> 00:07:26,577
to restore
its integrity,

194
00:07:26,665 --> 00:07:27,866
then you'll be
good to go.

195
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,059
You'll be out of here
in time for dinner.

196
00:07:29,146 --> 00:07:30,349
Pop-Pop?

197
00:07:30,592 --> 00:07:32,230
Dr. Bailey!

198
00:07:34,435 --> 00:07:35,996
Josh, you remember
Dr. Bailey?

199
00:07:36,084 --> 00:07:38,474
She's the one who takes out part
of my bowel every few years.

200
00:07:39,563 --> 00:07:41,551
Uh,
recurrent diverticulitis.

201
00:07:41,712 --> 00:07:43,152
Now, the last time
I saw you,

202
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:46,090
you were, what, a foot shorter
and studying for the SATs.

203
00:07:46,178 --> 00:07:47,261
He aced 'em!

204
00:07:47,349 --> 00:07:48,394
Aww.
And thanks to you,

205
00:07:48,482 --> 00:07:51,066
I saw him graduate from
high school and get into Udub.

206
00:07:51,154 --> 00:07:52,621
Next stop,
business school.

207
00:07:52,709 --> 00:07:54,512
I can't finish
those applications

208
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:56,004
until my back
stops hurting.

209
00:07:56,092 --> 00:07:57,113
He's getting

210
00:07:57,201 --> 00:07:59,033
- a vertebroplasty today.
- Oh.

211
00:07:59,121 --> 00:08:00,581
Did I say that right?

212
00:08:00,878 --> 00:08:03,199
I thought we'd be seeing
Dr. Lincoln,

213
00:08:03,287 --> 00:08:04,512
the fancy sports guy?

214
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,301
Oh, well, Dr. Kim is
Dr. Lincoln's fellow.

215
00:08:07,397 --> 00:08:10,215
He's being wooed
by the top hospitals

216
00:08:10,303 --> 00:08:11,902
and some
pro-sports teams.

217
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:13,784
You're lucky you've got him
while he's still here.

218
00:08:13,871 --> 00:08:15,074
Thank you,
Chief Bailey.

219
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:17,652
So, I will, uh, check back
a little later.

220
00:08:18,996 --> 00:08:20,551
Pressure's on, man.

221
00:08:24,132 --> 00:08:25,496
Wow.

222
00:08:27,212 --> 00:08:28,676
Which one
is that one?

223
00:08:30,457 --> 00:08:32,120
The Arc de Triomphe.

224
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:33,730
From Paris?

225
00:08:34,207 --> 00:08:37,629
The golden plate represents
the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.

226
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:39,715
Hm.
It's cool.

227
00:08:41,738 --> 00:08:43,105
Be back in a second.

228
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:45,835
<i>Dr. Ruta,
please contact the lab.</i>

229
00:08:45,922 --> 00:08:47,402
<i>Dr. Ruta,
please contact the lab.</i>

230
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:49,613
Any word from
the rare blood organizations?

231
00:08:49,701 --> 00:08:51,285
Well, I'm waiting on
that call from Amsterdam.

232
00:08:51,372 --> 00:08:53,238
He's getting weaker.
I need that blood.

233
00:08:53,326 --> 00:08:55,637
I've called Cristina.
I even called Marie Cerone.

234
00:08:55,725 --> 00:08:56,738
Thanks.

235
00:08:59,076 --> 00:09:00,355
What about Jo?

236
00:09:00,747 --> 00:09:02,183
She said anything yet?

237
00:09:02,726 --> 00:09:04,045
Not at all?

238
00:09:04,187 --> 00:09:05,885
It's happening again.

239
00:09:05,972 --> 00:09:07,353
It's not. No, they're
happy for a while...

240
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,082
- It's not happening.
- ...then they break...

241
00:09:09,169 --> 00:09:11,297
- She's not broken.
- ...and then they leave me.

242
00:09:11,385 --> 00:09:12,468
Listen to me.

243
00:09:12,556 --> 00:09:13,679
You have to trust her.

244
00:09:13,767 --> 00:09:14,930
She isn't Izzie.

245
00:09:15,018 --> 00:09:16,344
She isn't Ava or Lexie.

246
00:09:16,432 --> 00:09:17,789
She isn't your mother.

247
00:09:17,877 --> 00:09:20,063
And she's not broken,
and neither are you.

248
00:09:20,151 --> 00:09:21,953
She's going
through something.

249
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:25,105
And she's been through worse and
come out on the other side fine.

250
00:09:25,193 --> 00:09:27,149
She's just not ready
to talk about it yet.

251
00:09:27,305 --> 00:09:28,367
I've been there.

252
00:09:28,455 --> 00:09:31,063
You give me space.
You give me time.

253
00:09:31,422 --> 00:09:32,656
Right?

254
00:09:32,744 --> 00:09:33,907
Okay.

255
00:09:33,995 --> 00:09:35,875
It's not
happening again.

256
00:09:49,412 --> 00:09:50,835
Wow.

257
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,413
That's a lot
of journals.

258
00:09:53,505 --> 00:09:55,491
Oh, you got binders, too.
Great.

259
00:09:55,652 --> 00:09:58,913
Yeah, this is the lab where boring
things go to get more boring.

260
00:09:59,001 --> 00:10:00,319
Bailey's really
piling it on

261
00:10:00,407 --> 00:10:01,819
now that she's
chief again, huh?

262
00:10:01,907 --> 00:10:03,920
Yeah, didn't help that
I was out for a while.

263
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:06,256
Mm-hmm.

264
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:08,428
Okay, well, I don't want to
bother you, then.

265
00:10:08,777 --> 00:10:10,108
Bother me how?

266
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:11,249
Oh, nothing.

267
00:10:11,337 --> 00:10:12,539
I just thought
maybe you could help me

268
00:10:12,626 --> 00:10:13,864
with my
spray-on skin research,

269
00:10:13,952 --> 00:10:16,608
but you seem pretty
underwater, so...

270
00:10:17,021 --> 00:10:18,092
Wait.

271
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:20,923
That sounds way better
than any of this.

272
00:10:21,044 --> 00:10:22,748
Then again,
so does a root canal.

273
00:10:22,836 --> 00:10:25,545
Well, that's just the winning
attitude I'm looking for.

274
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:29,783
- So, you're a licensed therapist?
- I am.

275
00:10:30,089 --> 00:10:32,202
'Cause I don't believe in,
you know...

276
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,756
alternative...
whatever...

277
00:10:34,844 --> 00:10:38,217
You know, holistic...
voodoo stuff.

278
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:40,258
No voodoo.
Got it.

279
00:10:42,344 --> 00:10:44,467
Well, Megan
swears by this...

280
00:10:44,555 --> 00:10:46,367
Whatever this thing is
that you're doing, so...

281
00:10:46,454 --> 00:10:47,834
Neuro Emotional
Technique.

282
00:10:47,922 --> 00:10:48,803
Mm.

283
00:10:48,891 --> 00:10:50,795
It's a psycho-therapeutic
modality

284
00:10:50,883 --> 00:10:52,178
in which I use
muscle testing

285
00:10:52,266 --> 00:10:53,684
to determine
where in your body

286
00:10:53,772 --> 00:10:56,244
you might be holding on to
unresolved patterns of stress,

287
00:10:56,548 --> 00:10:58,552
- like trauma, physical injury...
- Hmm. Muscle testing.

288
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:01,655
Is that like when you, uh,
get weak when you're lying?

289
00:11:01,743 --> 00:11:03,794
Because that... that is
a party trick, not science.

290
00:11:03,882 --> 00:11:04,920
You're right.

291
00:11:05,008 --> 00:11:07,420
It's not the most precise
system of diagnosis,

292
00:11:07,508 --> 00:11:10,131
but, often, when your mind is
trying to hide something from you,

293
00:11:10,271 --> 00:11:12,358
your body will still
throw you under the bus.

294
00:11:12,842 --> 00:11:14,404
Well...

295
00:11:15,164 --> 00:11:17,506
This helped Megan
with her trauma, so...

296
00:11:18,435 --> 00:11:20,584
And she was held hostage
in Iraq.

297
00:11:20,672 --> 00:11:22,795
For a decade.
Presumed dead.

298
00:11:22,929 --> 00:11:26,655
So I figured, if it helped her,
then what the hell?

299
00:11:30,621 --> 00:11:32,521
Megan is convinced
that I am incapable

300
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:34,254
of allowing joy to
exist in my life

301
00:11:34,342 --> 00:11:35,506
due to some
unprocessed trauma

302
00:11:35,571 --> 00:11:39,460
that your weird voodoo therapy is
supposed to help me with, so...

303
00:11:40,358 --> 00:11:41,999
Do you think
she's right?

304
00:11:44,591 --> 00:11:46,030
Ow!

305
00:11:46,357 --> 00:11:48,170
This is worse
than it's ever been.

306
00:11:48,258 --> 00:11:49,725
I-I know it's hard,
Avi,

307
00:11:49,813 --> 00:11:51,826
but I'm gonna need you to hold
still for another little while.

308
00:11:51,913 --> 00:11:52,881
Okay?
You're doing great.

309
00:11:54,194 --> 00:11:55,949
- Hey, you paged?
- Hey.

310
00:11:56,037 --> 00:11:58,858
Uh, yes, I have a 24-year-old
patient with IBD.

311
00:11:58,946 --> 00:12:00,983
She presents with
severe abdominal pain.

312
00:12:01,077 --> 00:12:02,725
She thinks
it's an obstruction,

313
00:12:02,813 --> 00:12:04,281
but, I mean, she's in
way too much pain.

314
00:12:04,368 --> 00:12:05,406
I-I think it
might be a perf.

315
00:12:05,493 --> 00:12:06,497
- Ow.
- Yeah.

316
00:12:06,585 --> 00:12:07,409
- Okay.
- I'm... I'm waiting for

317
00:12:07,497 --> 00:12:08,780
the images to come up, so...

318
00:12:08,868 --> 00:12:09,782
Okay.

319
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:11,670
How was, uh,
Zola this morning?

320
00:12:11,758 --> 00:12:13,270
- She freaked out?
- I...

321
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:14,748
- Traumatized?
- I mean,

322
00:12:14,835 --> 00:12:16,374
I don't think so,
actually.

323
00:12:16,462 --> 00:12:18,741
I think she was
kind of normal-ish.

324
00:12:19,342 --> 00:12:21,287
I mean, it's hard to hear her
over my own tell-tale heart.

325
00:12:21,374 --> 00:12:22,668
Right?
I mean, why...

326
00:12:22,756 --> 00:12:23,639
Why do we feel so guilty?

327
00:12:23,727 --> 00:12:25,311
We're not doing
anything wrong, right?

328
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:26,780
Well...

329
00:12:27,662 --> 00:12:28,871
Do you even like kids?

330
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:29,952
What?

331
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,534
Well, we really haven't
talked about it,

332
00:12:31,621 --> 00:12:33,217
and I do
have three of them.

333
00:12:34,034 --> 00:12:37,499
I have 16 first cousins,
age 2 to 15.

334
00:12:37,608 --> 00:12:40,749
The 14-year-old, Tony,
always calls me about girls.

335
00:12:40,837 --> 00:12:42,505
He's been doing that
since he was 9.

336
00:12:42,592 --> 00:12:44,264
The 5-year-old, Sonia,

337
00:12:44,352 --> 00:12:46,327
she attaches herself to my leg
when she sees me,

338
00:12:46,415 --> 00:12:48,540
and I basically wear her
like a leg brace.

339
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:50,858
The 2-year-old,
Nicholas,

340
00:12:50,946 --> 00:12:52,693
likes to put things in my hair
and then dig them out.

341
00:12:55,301 --> 00:12:57,717
Your problem's not gonna be
that I don't like kids, Mer.

342
00:12:57,805 --> 00:13:00,312
Your problem's gonna be that your
kids might like me more than you.

343
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:01,467
- You think?
- Mm-hmm.

344
00:13:01,555 --> 00:13:02,415
Oh.

345
00:13:02,503 --> 00:13:03,585
Scans are up.

346
00:13:03,961 --> 00:13:05,450
Okay, Avi,
your scans are up.

347
00:13:05,538 --> 00:13:06,528
We're almost done here.

348
00:13:06,616 --> 00:13:08,249
Oh, my God.

349
00:13:08,337 --> 00:13:09,811
You didn't run
a pregnancy test?!

350
00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:12,582
No, no, no, Qadri said she ran
standard labs and then a CT.

351
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:13,545
What... Oh, my God.

352
00:13:13,632 --> 00:13:14,608
You guys,
I'm not pregnant.

353
00:13:14,696 --> 00:13:16,889
I just have...
Oww!

354
00:13:17,007 --> 00:13:20,130
Avi, you are pregnant,
and you are in labor,

355
00:13:20,218 --> 00:13:21,874
and it looks like
you're crowning.

356
00:13:21,962 --> 00:13:23,788
What?
What?

357
00:13:23,876 --> 00:13:26,321
- Let's page OB and page the chief.
- Yep.

358
00:13:30,006 --> 00:13:33,006
Uh, Dr. Pierce,
can you excuse us?

359
00:13:33,144 --> 00:13:35,340
I-I'd like a few minutes alone
with Gemma if there's time.

360
00:13:35,427 --> 00:13:36,240
- Of course.
- No.

361
00:13:36,328 --> 00:13:38,170
Gemma. No, I don't
want him in here.

362
00:13:38,258 --> 00:13:39,045
Dr. Webber...

363
00:13:39,133 --> 00:13:40,295
Gemma,
don't be ridiculous.

364
00:13:40,383 --> 00:13:42,546
- You are not my doctor.
- No, I'm your friend.

365
00:13:42,634 --> 00:13:44,513
And I owe it to Ollie
to check on you.

366
00:13:44,601 --> 00:13:46,224
Ollie is dead.

367
00:13:46,312 --> 00:13:49,225
I don't want you in here
preaching at me, praying at me,

368
00:13:49,313 --> 00:13:51,708
- pretending you relate.
- Except I do.

369
00:13:51,796 --> 00:13:53,717
No, you don't.
You got a wife.

370
00:13:54,546 --> 00:13:55,685
You got kids.

371
00:13:55,773 --> 00:13:58,021
I had a sponsor.
I had Ollie.

372
00:13:58,109 --> 00:14:00,474
And now I got a stiletto
in my chest

373
00:14:00,668 --> 00:14:03,138
and a bottle of tequila
waiting for me when I get home.

374
00:14:03,226 --> 00:14:06,490
And I don't want to hear what
you got to think about any of it.

375
00:14:06,606 --> 00:14:08,818
So get out of my room
before I call security.

376
00:14:08,906 --> 00:14:10,269
Oh,
for God's sakes, Gemma.

377
00:14:10,357 --> 00:14:11,724
Get out.

378
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:15,435
Um, you better run
a tox screen,

379
00:14:15,523 --> 00:14:16,678
make sure
she's not still drunk.

380
00:14:16,765 --> 00:14:18,592
You arrogant
son of a bitch!

381
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,490
Get out!
Get out!

382
00:14:20,578 --> 00:14:22,552
- Gemma, please calm down.
- Get out!

383
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,671
- Get out!
- Please... Gemma, please hold still.

384
00:14:23,758 --> 00:14:25,644
- Get out!
- Dr, Webber, get out! Please.

385
00:14:30,091 --> 00:14:31,662
- Did you page OB?
- Yeah,

386
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:32,999
it's a busy
delivery day, apparently.

387
00:14:33,086 --> 00:14:35,131
Oww!

388
00:14:35,219 --> 00:14:36,459
Okay, Avi,
good, push!

389
00:14:36,547 --> 00:14:38,529
How do you give
a pregnant woman a CT?

390
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:40,060
Qadri ordered the CT.

391
00:14:40,148 --> 00:14:41,724
'Cause I had
my period yesterday.

392
00:14:41,812 --> 00:14:43,665
This makes no seeeense!

393
00:14:43,753 --> 00:14:45,506
Bear down, Avi.
Good job.

394
00:14:45,594 --> 00:14:46,396
Oh!

395
00:14:46,484 --> 00:14:47,552
Oh, my God.

396
00:14:47,896 --> 00:14:48,903
Two wombs!

397
00:14:48,992 --> 00:14:50,445
- What? Ah!
- Hm.

398
00:14:50,533 --> 00:14:51,447
Oh, look at this!

399
00:14:51,535 --> 00:14:53,826
It's a u-uterus didelphys!

400
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:55,093
Look at this, Grey!

401
00:14:55,181 --> 00:14:56,974
I'm a little busy right now,
Dr. Bailey!

402
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:58,740
What the hell
is uter... Aaah!

403
00:14:58,832 --> 00:15:01,865
You have two uteri, but you're
only pregnant in one!

404
00:15:01,968 --> 00:15:03,817
Oh, my Go-o-o-o-d!

405
00:15:03,905 --> 00:15:05,873
- Good job, good job, Avi.
- Come on.

406
00:15:06,276 --> 00:15:07,607
You're almost there.

407
00:15:07,695 --> 00:15:08,975
Head down, okay?
Come on.

408
00:15:09,856 --> 00:15:11,631
Okay.

409
00:15:12,248 --> 00:15:14,076
Okay.

410
00:15:14,396 --> 00:15:17,271
Here's your baby boy.

411
00:15:30,872 --> 00:15:33,155
So, did you ever follow through
with the whole...

412
00:15:33,561 --> 00:15:34,858
birth-mom thing?

413
00:15:34,946 --> 00:15:35,928
Have you been talking
to Alex?

414
00:15:36,016 --> 00:15:37,694
Not about that, no.

415
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:41,513
- Well, you were right.
- About?

416
00:15:41,601 --> 00:15:42,513
You know what?

417
00:15:42,615 --> 00:15:43,739
Y-You said that you
needed me to help you

418
00:15:43,826 --> 00:15:44,740
with spray-on skin,

419
00:15:44,828 --> 00:15:46,108
so can we just
get to it already?

420
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:47,013
It's a process.

421
00:15:47,101 --> 00:15:49,974
Right now, we're focused on
aerosolization and coverage.

422
00:15:50,731 --> 00:15:51,903
I was wrong.

423
00:15:51,991 --> 00:15:52,919
This is a lab

424
00:15:53,007 --> 00:15:55,170
where boring things go
to get more boring.

425
00:15:55,424 --> 00:15:56,424
Mm.

426
00:15:56,798 --> 00:15:58,575
Injecting cement.

427
00:15:59,212 --> 00:16:01,388
<i>♪ Your grace ♪</i>

428
00:16:01,476 --> 00:16:03,521
<i>♪ Your grace ♪</i>

429
00:16:03,727 --> 00:16:05,107
<i>♪ Your grace ♪</i>

430
00:16:05,207 --> 00:16:06,340
Is that it?

431
00:16:06,428 --> 00:16:09,091
Just because I made it look easy
doesn't mean it was.

432
00:16:14,444 --> 00:16:15,794
Do you have them?

433
00:16:15,961 --> 00:16:17,630
The... The stem cells?
Are they here?

434
00:16:17,718 --> 00:16:18,755
Uh, not yet.

435
00:16:18,843 --> 00:16:20,951
Now we just have to get some
blood samples from your mom

436
00:16:21,038 --> 00:16:22,318
before the procedure.

437
00:16:22,406 --> 00:16:24,005
I can't quite breathe.

438
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:27,075
I-I mean, I can't
get a deep breath.

439
00:16:28,419 --> 00:16:30,841
And I think it's
because I'm so aware.

440
00:16:31,507 --> 00:16:33,670
I'm aware of my hands.

441
00:16:33,797 --> 00:16:35,710
I'm aware of my legs.

442
00:16:35,868 --> 00:16:37,638
My fingers.

443
00:16:38,248 --> 00:16:42,031
When I walk... every step...
I'm aware.

444
00:16:42,142 --> 00:16:43,435
I'm in awe.

445
00:16:43,763 --> 00:16:45,138
We're anxious
and we're depressed

446
00:16:45,226 --> 00:16:48,368
and we mope and we worry
about an extra five pounds

447
00:16:48,456 --> 00:16:50,318
or our...
Our stupid job.

448
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:51,934
Since the accident,
all I can think about

449
00:16:52,021 --> 00:16:56,134
are my feet
and my hands

450
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:59,532
and how grateful
I am for them.

451
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:01,343
♪ Way too close
to color your comfort ♪

452
00:17:01,431 --> 00:17:04,788
- <i>♪ All dressed up but kept undercover ♪</i>
- And I want them for my mom.

453
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:07,396
I want her hands back.

454
00:17:08,278 --> 00:17:11,849
I want them so badly,
I can't... quite breathe.

455
00:17:11,944 --> 00:17:14,700
<i>♪ All dressed up
but kept undercover ♪</i>

456
00:17:14,983 --> 00:17:16,897
All right, we need to suspend
the patient's breathing

457
00:17:16,984 --> 00:17:18,982
for about two minutes
while we inject.

458
00:17:19,147 --> 00:17:21,970
Lucky for everybody, I can do
a lot in, uh, two minutes.

459
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:24,748
Y...
What?

460
00:17:24,836 --> 00:17:26,169
Oh.

461
00:17:26,287 --> 00:17:28,146
You miss
your boyfriend.

462
00:17:28,365 --> 00:17:29,396
Who?

463
00:17:29,484 --> 00:17:30,763
Ortho Barbie.

464
00:17:30,851 --> 00:17:33,997
Shepherd, I can't believe
you have a thing with a jock!

465
00:17:34,085 --> 00:17:35,904
It's not... Shut up.

466
00:17:35,992 --> 00:17:37,985
Is it weird having sex
with a cartoon character?

467
00:17:38,073 --> 00:17:40,343
Does he drip ink on you
when he sweats?

468
00:17:40,554 --> 00:17:42,763
Okay, I made you laugh.
Come on. Spill.

469
00:17:42,851 --> 00:17:44,990
I need deets, and you,
obviously... you need advice.

470
00:17:45,078 --> 00:17:46,271
Fine.

471
00:17:46,359 --> 00:17:48,441
Yes, he looks
like a cartoon God,

472
00:17:48,529 --> 00:17:50,341
and the sex
is athletic,

473
00:17:50,429 --> 00:17:53,649
and there is eye contact,
and nobody cries after,

474
00:17:53,737 --> 00:17:55,890
and he's funny and fun
and easy to hang out with,

475
00:17:55,978 --> 00:17:56,990
which is just
confusing to me

476
00:17:57,077 --> 00:17:58,246
because it's
so not my type.

477
00:17:58,333 --> 00:17:59,872
Oh!
Okay.

478
00:18:00,068 --> 00:18:01,426
He's your Altman.
Hm.

479
00:18:01,514 --> 00:18:02,677
- My Altman?
- Yeah,

480
00:18:02,765 --> 00:18:05,677
you know, somebody so good
and unbroken and kind

481
00:18:05,765 --> 00:18:06,967
that they just seem
wrong for you,

482
00:18:07,054 --> 00:18:08,017
but, really, I mean,
you...

483
00:18:08,105 --> 00:18:09,388
You've never
been happier.

484
00:18:09,476 --> 00:18:11,474
So, yeah,
he's your Altman.

485
00:18:11,562 --> 00:18:12,935
Oh, Tom.

486
00:18:13,051 --> 00:18:14,341
You poor guy.

487
00:18:16,133 --> 00:18:19,224
So, you came home from Germany,
and you got back with Amelia.

488
00:18:19,513 --> 00:18:20,974
But that
wasn't what you wanted.

489
00:18:21,062 --> 00:18:22,107
It was.

490
00:18:22,195 --> 00:18:24,529
Amelia was... perfect.

491
00:18:24,779 --> 00:18:27,612
I mean, if there was...
There was no Teddy, then...

492
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,240
- There is a Teddy.
- No, there's not.

493
00:18:29,328 --> 00:18:30,966
I mean, she and I,
we just...

494
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:32,388
we have bad timing.

495
00:18:32,476 --> 00:18:33,929
But the timing was right
in Germany,

496
00:18:34,017 --> 00:18:35,521
and still, you blew it up.
Accidentally.

497
00:18:35,608 --> 00:18:36,982
Was it an accident?

498
00:18:37,571 --> 00:18:40,484
It's the opposite of what you
went to Germany to do, Owen.

499
00:18:40,765 --> 00:18:42,018
So why would you
blow it?

500
00:18:42,106 --> 00:18:44,716
You're not stupid.
You don't like hurting people.

501
00:18:45,395 --> 00:18:46,865
Why would you do it?

502
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:50,255
Uh, I...

503
00:18:52,033 --> 00:18:53,114
I don't know.

504
00:18:53,202 --> 00:18:55,092
Well, it seems like you
might be caught in a pattern.

505
00:18:55,179 --> 00:18:56,005
And if we can find

506
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:57,608
the original event
that started that pattern,

507
00:18:57,695 --> 00:18:59,769
we can just stop it
from replaying.

508
00:18:59,857 --> 00:19:00,912
That's it.

509
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,743
And that's your
E.N.T. thing?

510
00:19:02,831 --> 00:19:04,971
It's N.E.T., but whatever.

511
00:19:05,207 --> 00:19:06,200
Are you up for that?

512
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:11,378
Does it involve electric shocks
of any kind?

513
00:19:12,742 --> 00:19:14,162
I'm on my way
to a consult,

514
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:15,724
but I wanted to make sure
everything went okay.

515
00:19:15,811 --> 00:19:17,850
Josh was awesome.
Access site looks great.

516
00:19:17,938 --> 00:19:18,872
How do you feel?

517
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,663
No more stabbing knives
in my back.

518
00:19:20,889 --> 00:19:22,428
I think we're better
than okay, Chief.

519
00:19:22,515 --> 00:19:23,203
- Good.
- Hey,

520
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:25,123
what's the over/under
on the bathroom situation?

521
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:26,498
- Ooh, ooh.
- Do I need to continue to lie here?

522
00:19:26,585 --> 00:19:28,247
- You can go.
- I'll stop by later.

523
00:19:28,913 --> 00:19:30,503
All right, coming down.

524
00:19:30,591 --> 00:19:33,271
- Ooh.
- Good, careful, careful.

525
00:19:33,382 --> 00:19:34,465
Any tightness?

526
00:19:34,553 --> 00:19:36,076
No, no, I'm good.

527
00:19:36,595 --> 00:19:38,341
Ah, so,
what's your number one?

528
00:19:38,429 --> 00:19:40,248
UCSF, apparently.

529
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:42,996
Well, I have a Skype interview
with them later, actually.

530
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:44,756
Blow it off, man.
Hospitals are boring.

531
00:19:44,844 --> 00:19:46,319
Find yourself a hockey team,
you know?

532
00:19:46,406 --> 00:19:48,312
Fights, skates to the face,
busted shoulders.

533
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,903
It's a real money-maker
right there.

534
00:19:51,242 --> 00:19:53,270
Josh? Josh?
Josh?

535
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:54,176
- Call a code!
- Oh, my God.

536
00:19:54,264 --> 00:19:55,279
- We need a gurney over here.
- Oh, my God.

537
00:19:55,366 --> 00:19:56,067
Josh.

538
00:19:56,155 --> 00:19:57,169
- What's... What's happening?
- We need help.

539
00:19:57,256 --> 00:19:58,239
Take him outside.
Get a crash cart now.

540
00:19:58,327 --> 00:19:59,443
What's happening?
Oh, my God, Josh!

541
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:00,813
- Get me cardio.
- Josh!

542
00:20:00,975 --> 00:20:02,896
Start bagging him
and get an ABG now!

543
00:20:09,803 --> 00:20:11,079
How's she doing?

544
00:20:11,131 --> 00:20:13,379
I just need to make sure
that her heart isn't affected,

545
00:20:13,467 --> 00:20:14,943
and then I'll do
a pericardial window.

546
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:16,420
It's pretty simple.

547
00:20:17,521 --> 00:20:19,371
You really shouldn't
be here, Richard.

548
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:22,715
The last time
I saw Gemma,

549
00:20:22,803 --> 00:20:25,918
she was taking a cake
for 17 years' sobriety.

550
00:20:27,129 --> 00:20:28,715
Then Ollie died,

551
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:31,278
and I stopped going to
meetings for a while,

552
00:20:31,366 --> 00:20:33,270
and I guess
Gemma did, too.

553
00:20:34,341 --> 00:20:36,059
But you didn't drink.

554
00:20:37,052 --> 00:20:38,505
No, no.

555
00:20:38,593 --> 00:20:41,426
I took a baseball bat
to a bar.

556
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:44,200
And if I didn't have a lot of
money to settle with the bar,

557
00:20:44,288 --> 00:20:45,450
I would've
lost my license.

558
00:20:45,538 --> 00:20:47,637
I could've
gone to prison.

559
00:20:47,757 --> 00:20:49,550
I was a dry drunk,
Maggie,

560
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:52,410
and I was angry,
and it was painful,

561
00:20:52,498 --> 00:20:53,871
and...

562
00:20:54,781 --> 00:20:56,574
if it weren't
for Catherine, I...

563
00:20:58,676 --> 00:21:00,762
Dr. Pierce, we have a 911 page
for cardio from ortho.

564
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:02,311
Altman's in surgery,
and so is Roberts.

565
00:21:02,398 --> 00:21:03,856
Oh, go, go.
I can handle it.

566
00:21:04,047 --> 00:21:05,066
She doesn't want you
on her case.

567
00:21:05,153 --> 00:21:06,806
Look, I'll talk Qadri
through it.

568
00:21:07,071 --> 00:21:09,245
- Go where you're needed, Maggie.
- Okay.

569
00:21:12,982 --> 00:21:14,095
Hi, Avi.

570
00:21:14,205 --> 00:21:15,349
How you feeling?

571
00:21:15,506 --> 00:21:16,566
Hey.

572
00:21:16,654 --> 00:21:17,987
- Look at him.
- Hello.

573
00:21:18,075 --> 00:21:19,238
Look at what I made.

574
00:21:19,326 --> 00:21:20,682
Yeah.

575
00:21:22,824 --> 00:21:24,050
It's Tucker.

576
00:21:24,234 --> 00:21:25,449
Again.

577
00:21:25,538 --> 00:21:27,201
I mean, really.

578
00:21:27,289 --> 00:21:30,613
There are worse things
than to have two good men

579
00:21:30,701 --> 00:21:31,957
who the boy feels close to.

580
00:21:32,045 --> 00:21:33,965
So you'd be cool
if Tucker got remarried

581
00:21:34,053 --> 00:21:35,527
and Tuck called
his new wife "Mom"?

582
00:21:35,623 --> 00:21:37,473
Now, why would you say
a vicious thing like that?

583
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:40,308
I'm just saying, I just...
Can we please talk about me?

584
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:42,894
How did you tell Tuck
that you were dating Ben?

585
00:21:42,982 --> 00:21:46,183
I... You know, on some level,
Tuck already knew.

586
00:21:46,287 --> 00:21:48,316
Look, all you have to do
is show up,

587
00:21:48,404 --> 00:21:51,558
make it clear what's happening,
answer her questions.

588
00:21:51,646 --> 00:21:53,582
All she wants to know is that
you're there for her,

589
00:21:53,669 --> 00:21:55,590
and you're not going anywhere
no matter what.

590
00:21:57,011 --> 00:22:00,121
Okay, so, apparently Qadri
did do a pregnancy test,

591
00:22:00,209 --> 00:22:01,419
but she didn't
wait for the results

592
00:22:01,506 --> 00:22:03,083
because Avi was so sure
she knew what was going on.

593
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:04,413
Okay, I'm gonna
say a thing,

594
00:22:04,501 --> 00:22:05,965
if only to spare you
the humiliation

595
00:22:06,053 --> 00:22:07,137
of your girlfriend
having to say it.

596
00:22:07,224 --> 00:22:09,731
- Trust, but verify.
- Trust, but verify!

597
00:22:10,485 --> 00:22:11,948
I heard about
this morning, too.

598
00:22:12,036 --> 00:22:13,545
You're really batting
a thousand today.

599
00:22:13,632 --> 00:22:14,686
Oh, it...

600
00:22:14,827 --> 00:22:16,725
It was in the middle of the night!

601
00:22:19,575 --> 00:22:21,083
Let's go back
to Germany,

602
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:22,833
and just...

603
00:22:23,072 --> 00:22:25,528
- to when you saidthe thing to Teddy.
- Mm-hmm.

604
00:22:25,616 --> 00:22:26,927
Just focus on
what you were

605
00:22:27,015 --> 00:22:28,373
- feeling in that moment.
- Okay.

606
00:22:28,461 --> 00:22:30,454
Just be there,
and hold your arm strong.

607
00:22:30,576 --> 00:22:32,388
Okay.

608
00:22:35,639 --> 00:22:37,450
And...

609
00:22:39,075 --> 00:22:40,497
Okay, there it is.

610
00:22:40,585 --> 00:22:42,419
- So, now, just let that go.
- Mm-hmm.

611
00:22:42,507 --> 00:22:44,278
Think about something else,
anything else,

612
00:22:44,453 --> 00:22:48,817
and let's check
the concept of nervousness.

613
00:22:49,297 --> 00:22:50,950
Of despair.

614
00:22:51,571 --> 00:22:53,364
Feeling of distrust.

615
00:22:53,467 --> 00:22:54,997
Feeling of distrust.

616
00:22:55,085 --> 00:22:57,403
Sensitivity to
someone else's distrust.

617
00:22:57,574 --> 00:22:58,897
Your distrust.

618
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:01,442
Okay, so, it's yours.

619
00:23:01,614 --> 00:23:03,184
That's crazy.

620
00:23:03,333 --> 00:23:05,349
Do you feel
distrustful of Teddy?

621
00:23:05,575 --> 00:23:06,640
No.

622
00:23:06,728 --> 00:23:08,177
Can you remember
a time in your life

623
00:23:08,265 --> 00:23:09,559
when you felt that way?

624
00:23:10,616 --> 00:23:12,294
Uh...

625
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:14,184
You know what?
That's a broad question.

626
00:23:14,272 --> 00:23:16,067
Let's just check
when it could've happened.

627
00:23:16,233 --> 00:23:17,516
Conception to five.

628
00:23:17,666 --> 00:23:19,178
Listen, w-why don't we just
skip to the Iraq War,

629
00:23:19,265 --> 00:23:20,943
'cause if we're talking about
trauma, that's where it started.

630
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:22,263
So...
Okay.

631
00:23:22,351 --> 00:23:24,684
Was it
during the Iraq War?

632
00:23:24,801 --> 00:23:26,424
No, it's not
the war, then.

633
00:23:26,512 --> 00:23:28,309
Five to ten?

634
00:23:29,605 --> 00:23:31,518
Five?
Six?

635
00:23:31,738 --> 00:23:34,020
Seven?
Eight?

636
00:23:34,382 --> 00:23:37,184
Nine?
Ten?

637
00:23:37,942 --> 00:23:41,333
Do you have a memory of feeling
distrustful when you were ten?

638
00:23:41,421 --> 00:23:42,591
No.

639
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:45,919
I don't know.

640
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:47,208
Okay.

641
00:23:47,913 --> 00:23:50,817
Do you remember feeling joy at ten?
Probably. I was ten.

642
00:23:51,171 --> 00:23:53,200
Don't look too hard.

643
00:23:55,606 --> 00:23:57,060
There's probably a memory
sitting right there.

644
00:23:57,147 --> 00:23:59,263
Just the first thing
you think of.

645
00:24:01,578 --> 00:24:03,168
I won an award.

646
00:24:05,585 --> 00:24:07,934
There was
a Science Bee at school.

647
00:24:08,239 --> 00:24:10,638
And, um,
lasted three days.

648
00:24:10,726 --> 00:24:11,929
All grades.

649
00:24:12,017 --> 00:24:14,263
I beat everyone
at the school.

650
00:24:14,958 --> 00:24:16,130
How'd you feel
about that?

651
00:24:16,218 --> 00:24:18,294
Great. Proud.

652
00:24:20,982 --> 00:24:22,802
Best that I've ever felt.

653
00:24:23,787 --> 00:24:25,231
It doesn't
sound like it.

654
00:24:31,561 --> 00:24:33,528
So you told him
to go to Germany.

655
00:24:33,641 --> 00:24:35,514
Because every time
I looked at him,

656
00:24:35,602 --> 00:24:36,935
I could see him
thinking about her.

657
00:24:37,022 --> 00:24:38,997
And he went,
and she rejected him.

658
00:24:39,085 --> 00:24:41,278
He went to Germany,
declared his love,

659
00:24:41,366 --> 00:24:43,138
and she declared it back.

660
00:24:43,226 --> 00:24:45,224
She loves him, Tom.
She always has.

661
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:46,294
And... And now
there's a baby.

662
00:24:46,382 --> 00:24:47,216
I was kind of hoping
she was

663
00:24:47,304 --> 00:24:49,083
a one-night-stand-
between-friends baby.

664
00:24:49,171 --> 00:24:51,754
Nope, she is definitely
a love baby.

665
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:52,975
Except for
the salty brunette

666
00:24:53,062 --> 00:24:54,809
who keeps showing up
back in his bed.

667
00:24:55,146 --> 00:24:57,349
Tom, I'm telling you this
as a friend...

668
00:24:57,437 --> 00:24:59,388
Owen and Teddy
are inevitable.

669
00:24:59,836 --> 00:25:00,999
Hey!

670
00:25:01,087 --> 00:25:02,176
Stem cells are here.

671
00:25:02,264 --> 00:25:03,528
OR 2 is prepped.

672
00:25:03,616 --> 00:25:04,761
My man!

673
00:25:04,849 --> 00:25:05,825
See you in there.

674
00:25:05,913 --> 00:25:07,403
Yeah. Ah. Mm!

675
00:25:07,507 --> 00:25:08,651
- Shut up.
- Shepherd.

676
00:25:09,135 --> 00:25:11,052
We're about to perform
an experimental procedure

677
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:12,685
in which we might give
a paralyzed woman

678
00:25:12,772 --> 00:25:14,013
the use of her arms.

679
00:25:14,101 --> 00:25:17,075
"Inevitable"
doesn't scare me.

680
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:23,465
Let's go off bypass.

681
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:25,593
I-I was careful. I...

682
00:25:25,681 --> 00:25:27,426
I don't know if you used
the wrong amount of pressure

683
00:25:27,513 --> 00:25:28,886
or if the cement
was too liquid,

684
00:25:28,974 --> 00:25:30,744
but the pulmonary artery
is destroyed.

685
00:25:30,832 --> 00:25:32,769
I pieced it together, but
the graft is barely holding.

686
00:25:32,856 --> 00:25:33,930
What can I do?

687
00:25:34,018 --> 00:25:35,783
This is a temporary fix
at best.

688
00:25:35,871 --> 00:25:36,970
We could consider
putting him

689
00:25:37,057 --> 00:25:38,529
- on the transplant list.
- Transplant?

690
00:25:38,616 --> 00:25:41,594
If you can think of a better way
to save your patient from dying,

691
00:25:41,682 --> 00:25:42,716
I'd love to hear it.

692
00:25:42,804 --> 00:25:44,263
Damn it. Schmitt, suction!

693
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:45,247
The repair
didn't hold?

694
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:46,942
There is nothing here
to hold onto.

695
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:49,012
Clamp!

696
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,489
Flap!

697
00:25:51,757 --> 00:25:52,854
Suction!

698
00:25:55,476 --> 00:25:57,169
I ran home after school.

699
00:25:58,122 --> 00:26:01,091
I had this big certificate
with a seal.

700
00:26:01,179 --> 00:26:04,632
You know, like, uh, foil.

701
00:26:04,852 --> 00:26:06,465
I remember that.

702
00:26:07,577 --> 00:26:11,137
And, uh, my mom was
waiting for me in the kitchen.

703
00:26:12,318 --> 00:26:13,747
And I was about
to show her it,

704
00:26:13,835 --> 00:26:16,192
and then she said,
"Owen, sit down."

705
00:26:16,684 --> 00:26:18,597
So I sat down,

706
00:26:20,192 --> 00:26:22,651
and... she told me
that my dad died...

707
00:26:23,859 --> 00:26:25,439
that day.

708
00:26:27,563 --> 00:26:29,628
So...
I'm sorry.

709
00:26:30,344 --> 00:26:33,573
What about the prize?
The certificate.

710
00:26:33,723 --> 00:26:34,815
What?

711
00:26:34,903 --> 00:26:37,057
Oh. I-I didn't tell her
about that.

712
00:26:37,145 --> 00:26:38,690
I didn't tell anybody.

713
00:26:38,882 --> 00:26:40,698
I was, um,
you know...

714
00:26:41,147 --> 00:26:44,659
I was ashamed
that I was so proud,

715
00:26:45,254 --> 00:26:50,628
that I was so... happy
when she was so sad.

716
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:55,386
And my dad was, um...

717
00:26:55,571 --> 00:26:58,249
Owen, I think you've been
reliving this moment ever since.

718
00:26:58,337 --> 00:27:00,219
No, no, no.

719
00:27:00,307 --> 00:27:02,477
I think you don't
trust joy.

720
00:27:02,945 --> 00:27:06,266
I think you stop it before
something terrible happens,

721
00:27:06,652 --> 00:27:08,590
before the bad news comes.

722
00:27:10,002 --> 00:27:11,672
But it's not
coming anymore.

723
00:27:11,943 --> 00:27:13,766
That moment is over.

724
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:17,094
It came,
and you're okay.

725
00:27:17,882 --> 00:27:19,922
So let's
stop the replay.

726
00:27:24,422 --> 00:27:26,085
How?

727
00:27:26,391 --> 00:27:28,180
Okay,
I want you to...

728
00:27:28,888 --> 00:27:32,613
I want you to put your hand on
your wrist like this, okay?

729
00:27:32,748 --> 00:27:35,274
And then put your hand
on your forehead.

730
00:27:38,304 --> 00:27:41,305
And just sit
and breathe.

731
00:28:05,747 --> 00:28:09,018
<i>Dr. Franco,
please call extension 523.</i>

732
00:28:09,159 --> 00:28:12,040
<i>Dr. Franco,
please call extension 523.</i>

733
00:28:12,722 --> 00:28:14,381
You don't quit, huh?

734
00:28:14,476 --> 00:28:15,834
You bring
a "Big Book"?

735
00:28:15,922 --> 00:28:17,755
You planning
to read to me

736
00:28:17,874 --> 00:28:19,811
while I'm too weak
to stop you?

737
00:28:19,967 --> 00:28:21,318
I just wanted
to update you.

738
00:28:21,406 --> 00:28:24,193
Dr. Pierce had an emergency
with another patient.

739
00:28:24,334 --> 00:28:27,077
So... she didn't
do your surgery.

740
00:28:27,725 --> 00:28:29,207
I did.

741
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:31,172
Oh.

742
00:28:32,381 --> 00:28:33,904
So I can sue you.

743
00:28:34,241 --> 00:28:35,756
Buy me
a new pair of shoes.

744
00:28:35,844 --> 00:28:37,177
You do
whatever you want to.

745
00:28:37,265 --> 00:28:39,498
Although it would make you
a serious ingrate,

746
00:28:39,586 --> 00:28:41,498
seeing how I saved
your damn life,

747
00:28:41,662 --> 00:28:43,139
you stubborn drunk!

748
00:28:52,489 --> 00:28:55,458
Ow, ow. Hurts.

749
00:28:55,661 --> 00:28:57,240
Hurts when I laugh.

750
00:28:57,328 --> 00:28:58,403
Well, it ought to hurt.

751
00:28:58,491 --> 00:29:00,362
You punctured
your heart with a shoe.

752
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:01,457
Heh.

753
00:29:01,544 --> 00:29:03,286
That's a new bottom
if I ever heard one.

754
00:29:05,551 --> 00:29:07,716
I had 17 years.

755
00:29:07,997 --> 00:29:09,443
I know.

756
00:29:11,214 --> 00:29:12,755
I want 'em back.

757
00:29:17,124 --> 00:29:19,747
The years
don't matter, Gemma.

758
00:29:19,834 --> 00:29:21,482
Just today.

759
00:29:22,122 --> 00:29:26,458
It's just... It's just
one day at a time.

760
00:29:26,546 --> 00:29:30,039
You start your count all
over again and tell me that.

761
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:33,457
Well, not long ago,
I almost did.

762
00:29:33,794 --> 00:29:35,865
I slid my chip
across a bar,

763
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:38,365
traded it
for a line of shots.

764
00:29:38,824 --> 00:29:40,357
You did what?

765
00:29:41,099 --> 00:29:42,833
It was a very bad day.

766
00:29:43,374 --> 00:29:44,857
Tell me more.

767
00:29:45,748 --> 00:29:47,724
You stubborn drunk.

768
00:30:00,193 --> 00:30:02,294
Thank you
for finding this study.

769
00:30:02,382 --> 00:30:04,943
Thank you for inspiring me
to find this study.

770
00:30:05,031 --> 00:30:06,152
I'll thank you both
to stop

771
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,950
before I vomit
into an open spine.

772
00:30:08,038 --> 00:30:09,873
Okay,
suspend her breathing.

773
00:30:11,624 --> 00:30:13,127
Okay.

774
00:30:18,213 --> 00:30:20,826
I know you love Ben
and I know you didn't mean to,

775
00:30:20,914 --> 00:30:22,497
but it hurt
your father's feelings,

776
00:30:22,584 --> 00:30:24,747
so you just have to
say you're sorry

777
00:30:24,834 --> 00:30:26,827
and go back to
calling Ben "Ben."

778
00:30:26,914 --> 00:30:27,948
Wait, hold on.

779
00:30:28,036 --> 00:30:29,458
Pop-Pop.

780
00:30:32,222 --> 00:30:34,325
Hey, what happened?
Something went wrong.

781
00:30:34,413 --> 00:30:35,662
- They took him. Dr. Bailey,
- What? Josh should be out by...

782
00:30:35,749 --> 00:30:37,412
something went
really wrong.

783
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:40,355
Okay, uh,
I'll find out, okay?

784
00:30:40,443 --> 00:30:42,127
I'll be right back.

785
00:30:49,044 --> 00:30:50,207
No.

786
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:53,388
How?

787
00:30:53,706 --> 00:30:56,122
Massive pulmonary artery
embolism.

788
00:30:56,294 --> 00:30:57,247
The bone cement...

789
00:30:57,334 --> 00:30:58,537
Okay, wait, I don't want
to hear it from you.

790
00:30:58,624 --> 00:31:00,240
I want to hear it
from you.

791
00:31:02,114 --> 00:31:03,872
The cement leaked,
causing a blood clot.

792
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,542
He went
into cardiac arrest.

793
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:08,207
Dr. Pierce tried to repair
the pulmonary artery.

794
00:31:08,294 --> 00:31:09,512
We tried everything
we could, and we...

795
00:31:09,599 --> 00:31:10,534
You made a mistake

796
00:31:10,622 --> 00:31:12,417
on a healthy
21-year-old man.

797
00:31:12,504 --> 00:31:14,802
And that man is now dead.
That's what happened.

798
00:31:24,926 --> 00:31:26,549
Schmitt, you close.

799
00:31:26,637 --> 00:31:27,746
And you...

800
00:31:27,834 --> 00:31:29,627
You are gonna stand
right next to me

801
00:31:29,714 --> 00:31:32,302
and take in every moment
of that grandfather's grief.

802
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:35,826
And if you're a good surgeon,
you'll remember it.

803
00:31:35,914 --> 00:31:37,917
And you'll never make
this mistake again.

804
00:31:56,084 --> 00:31:59,167
Look, the way I see it is we can
keep working in awkward silence

805
00:31:59,254 --> 00:32:01,544
until it's time for you to
go home, or... I vote that.

806
00:32:01,632 --> 00:32:04,295
...or you can tell me what
you meant by "I was right."

807
00:32:04,434 --> 00:32:06,956
'Cause I could, maybe,
help you feel,

808
00:32:07,044 --> 00:32:08,627
I don't know,
one drop less crappy.

809
00:32:08,721 --> 00:32:10,890
You told me
not to go looking,

810
00:32:11,061 --> 00:32:11,894
and you were right.

811
00:32:11,982 --> 00:32:13,278
- That's all, so...
- Jo, I told you not to go

812
00:32:13,365 --> 00:32:14,771
looking
if everything was okay.

813
00:32:14,959 --> 00:32:17,347
You went looking, so maybe
everything was not okay.

814
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:18,529
Maybe you needed that.

815
00:32:18,617 --> 00:32:20,302
No, no. You know what?
I had everything.

816
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:23,396
I had a marriage
and a job and...

817
00:32:23,543 --> 00:32:25,708
Yeah,
Alex is right here.

818
00:32:25,953 --> 00:32:28,253
You got a great job
right here.

819
00:32:28,341 --> 00:32:29,331
You're doing it right now.

820
00:32:29,419 --> 00:32:31,075
I'm spraying water
on a paper towel,

821
00:32:31,163 --> 00:32:33,696
and Alex
is anything but happy.

822
00:32:33,874 --> 00:32:35,800
'Cause he's
worried about you.

823
00:32:35,888 --> 00:32:37,327
He's trying to help.
Come on.

824
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:39,287
I knew it.
I knew it.

825
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:41,747
He sent you here.
No, he didn't.

826
00:32:41,872 --> 00:32:43,240
Jo, that's not
what this is.

827
00:32:43,328 --> 00:32:44,253
Then what is it?

828
00:32:44,341 --> 00:32:45,847
The guy's worried,
okay?

829
00:32:45,935 --> 00:32:47,294
He's...
wondering.

830
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:48,848
Why don't you just
communicate with him?

831
00:32:48,935 --> 00:32:50,553
'Cause it would only hurt,
and it won't help.

832
00:32:54,085 --> 00:32:55,118
You don't know that.

833
00:32:55,206 --> 00:32:56,316
I had all this happy,

834
00:32:56,404 --> 00:32:58,416
and I just...
tossed it aside

835
00:32:58,504 --> 00:32:59,564
like it
would always exist.

836
00:32:59,652 --> 00:33:01,503
I mean, we...
We see it all the time.

837
00:33:01,769 --> 00:33:04,457
We diagnose patients
with terrible diseases

838
00:33:04,544 --> 00:33:06,524
or we tell someone that
their husband dropped dead

839
00:33:06,612 --> 00:33:07,792
of...
Of a heart attack,

840
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,775
and all they can say is
they were fine yesterday,

841
00:33:09,862 --> 00:33:11,534
and they were.
They were fine.

842
00:33:11,754 --> 00:33:13,183
I was fine.

843
00:33:14,097 --> 00:33:15,425
And I took it
for granted,

844
00:33:15,513 --> 00:33:18,581
and now it feels impossible
to get it back.

845
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:24,089
It was Mer.

846
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:27,692
It was Meredith that asked me
to look in on you.

847
00:33:27,886 --> 00:33:31,323
She knows how our parents
can screw with our heads.

848
00:33:31,769 --> 00:33:33,454
I'm here, okay?

849
00:33:33,542 --> 00:33:34,287
I'm working.

850
00:33:34,374 --> 00:33:36,300
You came to work
drunk, Jo.

851
00:33:37,794 --> 00:33:39,417
You're still drunk.

852
00:33:40,624 --> 00:33:41,704
I can smell it.

853
00:33:41,792 --> 00:33:43,620
I'm thinking vodka
in the water bottle.

854
00:33:44,004 --> 00:33:46,283
I'm glad you had the decency
not to see any patients today.

855
00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:47,212
- That's nice.
- You don't know

856
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:49,472
- what you're talking about.
- You're in a lot of pain,

857
00:33:49,624 --> 00:33:50,767
and you're trying
to numb it.

858
00:33:50,855 --> 00:33:52,425
I get that, okay?

859
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:53,520
It's not gonna work.

860
00:33:53,608 --> 00:33:55,689
I'm telling you.
You're gonna ruin your life.

861
00:33:55,777 --> 00:33:57,409
Jo, don't leave.

862
00:33:57,874 --> 00:33:59,548
Just talk to me
for a second.

863
00:33:59,636 --> 00:34:00,787
I'm trying to help you.

864
00:34:07,663 --> 00:34:10,222
You set foot in this hospital
drunk again,

865
00:34:11,410 --> 00:34:13,693
you're not gonna be met
with compassion.

866
00:34:28,151 --> 00:34:30,052
<i>Kadiatou's "Say Something"

867

868

869

I see that.

A thing I've learned

911
00:36:39,842 --> 00:36:42,381
is that life
is a series of choices.

912
00:36:42,687 --> 00:36:46,272
And that sometimes,
there is an easier, softer way.

913

you saw Dr. DeLuca here

1013
00:41:30,538 --> 00:41:33,825
was because he and I have been

1014
00:41:33,927 --> 00:41:35,143
Is he
your boyfriend?

1015

He is.

1016
00:41:36,333 --> 00:41:37,741
What's that mean?

1017
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:41,333
Well, that means
that I like him a lot.

1018
00:41:41,567 --> 00:41:43,610
Not more than you,
but a lot.

1019
00:41:43,698 --> 00:41:45,321
Are you gonna
kiss him?

1020
00:41:45,408 --> 00:41:46,448
Probably.

1021
00:41:46,536 --> 00:41:48,607
- Ew, gross!
- Oh, gross!

1022
00:41:48,695 --> 00:41:50,689
Is he gonna sleep on the couch again?

1023
00:41:50,776 --> 00:41:53,189
No, he won't be
sleeping on the couch,

1024
00:41:53,277 --> 00:41:55,575
but he may be coming around
a lot more, so...

1025
00:41:56,041 --> 00:41:57,739
But I'm not
going anywhere.

1026
00:41:58,066 --> 00:41:59,191
You're stuck with me.

1027
00:41:59,279 --> 00:42:00,741
Can he leave
his guitar at home?

1028
00:42:02,294 --> 00:42:05,439
And it's up to us to appreciate
them to the fullest

1029
00:42:05,831 --> 00:42:07,084
