1
00:00:01,228 --> 00:00:03,593
When I was little,
I once asked my mother.

2
00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:06,166
How do you tell people
such bad news?

3
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:09,262
You tell them the truth,
she said.

4
00:00:09,724 --> 00:00:12,399
<i>"But you tell them
the best version of the truth</i>

5
00:00:12,477 --> 00:00:14,260
<i>you can come up with."</i>

6
00:00:14,683 --> 00:00:17,381
<i>My mother also never told me
I had a little sister.</i>

7
00:00:17,459 --> 00:00:20,049
<i>So, grain of salt.</i>

8
00:00:20,378 --> 00:00:22,894
- What are you doing up?
- <i>♪ Tiptoe past the graveyard ♪</i>

9
00:00:22,972 --> 00:00:25,337
- Couldn't sleep. Neither could Ellis.
- <i>♪ On our best behavior ♪</i>

10
00:00:25,415 --> 00:00:26,747
She wants some milk.

11
00:00:26,825 --> 00:00:28,625
Are Owen and Amelia
falling in love,

12
00:00:28,703 --> 00:00:30,785
or are they just
falling back into bed?

13
00:00:30,863 --> 00:00:32,713
That's what's keeping you up
at night?

14
00:00:32,844 --> 00:00:34,886
Not Jackson's disappearing act?

15
00:00:34,964 --> 00:00:36,765
Jackson sent me
a picture of a tree.

16
00:00:36,843 --> 00:00:39,464
- A picture of a tree?
- Why?

17
00:00:39,542 --> 00:00:40,778
Look, what I'm saying is,

18
00:00:40,856 --> 00:00:42,733
if there's something
that Amelia can't see coming

19
00:00:42,811 --> 00:00:45,571
that's gonna pop out and
ruin everything,

20
00:00:45,649 --> 00:00:46,944
she should know about it,
right?

21
00:00:47,022 --> 00:00:49,570
Like you didn't see
the Jackson thing coming?

22
00:00:49,935 --> 00:00:51,888
No. Jackson's coming back.

23
00:00:51,966 --> 00:00:53,195
Is that what he said?

24
00:00:53,273 --> 00:00:55,660
- <i>♪ We've got all the time ♪</i>
- The tree.

25
00:00:55,738 --> 00:00:57,267
- <i>♪ in the world to kill ♪</i>
- What does a tree have to do,

26
00:00:57,345 --> 00:00:58,882
And what if
there is something coming

27
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,315
for Owen and Amelia
and there's no undoing it?

28
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:04,770
Like, there's no picture of a tree

29
00:01:04,848 --> 00:01:06,392
that could begin to undo it?

30
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:08,019
Do you need a sedative?

31
00:01:08,148 --> 00:01:09,543
Mama.

32
00:01:13,732 --> 00:01:14,841
Go back to bed.

33
00:01:14,919 --> 00:01:17,049
Owen and Amelia are fine.

34
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:19,527
I am not being ridiculous.

35
00:01:19,605 --> 00:01:21,775
- <i>You</i> are being ridiculous.
- God, you are such a hag!

36
00:01:21,853 --> 00:01:23,494
Hey, hey, hey,
I just got Leo back down,

37
00:01:23,572 --> 00:01:25,736
so could we bring
the volume down, please?

38
00:01:25,814 --> 00:01:26,965
We ha...

39
00:01:27,043 --> 00:01:28,723
We had one rule,
you do not do drugs.

40
00:01:28,801 --> 00:01:30,048
Well, great,
'cause I didn't do any drugs.

41
00:01:30,126 --> 00:01:31,762
Oh, you walked through
that door high as a kite,

42
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,300
and if you think that
I can't,

43
00:01:34,347 --> 00:01:35,409
Sorry, Leo.

44
00:01:35,487 --> 00:01:36,403
<i>♪ I'm digging ♪</i>

45
00:01:36,481 --> 00:01:37,959
- <i>♪ in my hooks, ♪</i>
- Listen, she had a slip.

46
00:01:38,037 --> 00:01:39,723
<i>- ♪ my pages ♪</i>
- I'm not sure shaming her about it,

47
00:01:39,801 --> 00:01:41,189
- <i>♪ on the floor ♪</i>
I'm not shaming her about a slip.

48
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:42,348
I can handle a slip.

49
00:01:42,426 --> 00:01:43,876
What I will not abide is for her

50
00:01:43,954 --> 00:01:46,095
- to stand here in my house,
- My house.

51
00:01:46,173 --> 00:01:48,431
In your house
and lie right to my face.

52
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:50,824
That is not okay.
That is unacceptable,

53
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:53,009
and I would think that I would
get a little backup from you.

54
00:01:53,087 --> 00:01:55,253
- I backed you up.
- You said, "Hey."

55
00:01:55,695 --> 00:01:56,891
Well, what do you want to do?

56
00:01:56,969 --> 00:01:58,152
Well, I can't do
what I want to do,

57
00:01:58,230 --> 00:01:59,369
or we'd have
to hide her body.

58
00:01:59,447 --> 00:02:01,236
God, this is how
my mom must have felt.

59
00:02:01,314 --> 00:02:02,332
Let's go to bed.

60
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:03,705
We'll think more clearly
about this in the morning.

61
00:02:03,783 --> 00:02:05,230
Okay? Come on.

62
00:02:05,417 --> 00:02:07,074
- Hag.
- You know what?

63
00:02:07,152 --> 00:02:10,542
If you are gonna call me names,
call me names to my face!

64
00:02:11,854 --> 00:02:13,054
Great.

65
00:02:14,192 --> 00:02:16,598
<i>♪ Fill it up, fill it up ♪</i>

66
00:02:16,676 --> 00:02:18,603
Okay, you're not here
right now, and, trust me,

67
00:02:18,681 --> 00:02:20,284
you really want to be.

68
00:02:20,458 --> 00:02:22,892
Yeah, well, I'm sorry.
My mind won't shut off.

69
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:25,675
Mm. And something else
won't turn on.

70
00:02:25,922 --> 00:02:27,832
Why did I take this stupid job?

71
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:29,059
Because you'll be
awesome at it.

72
00:02:29,137 --> 00:02:31,048
No, no, no, no.
I'm an awesome surgeon.

73
00:02:31,126 --> 00:02:32,184
I suck at this.

74
00:02:32,262 --> 00:02:34,419
And all anyone does
is ask for stuff.

75
00:02:38,744 --> 00:02:40,481
So, Bailey and I are finally

76
00:02:40,559 --> 00:02:42,370
on the same page
with my fellowship.

77
00:02:42,735 --> 00:02:45,548
I'm gonna pitch that
we get an INUMAC MRI.

78
00:02:45,626 --> 00:02:46,879
Wait.

79
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,243
You want an INUMAC MRI?

80
00:02:49,321 --> 00:02:50,998
Mm-hmm.
Everyone can use it.

81
00:02:51,076 --> 00:02:53,195
It'll pay for itself eventually.

82
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:54,812
Mmm.

83
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:56,991
Are you hitting me up
for money

84
00:02:57,069 --> 00:02:58,212
with your hand on my, uh...

85
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:00,494
What? Wait. Wait.
No! What? No!

86
00:03:00,572 --> 00:03:02,530
Alex, my hand was already
there from before.

87
00:03:02,608 --> 00:03:03,697
What, No.

88
00:03:03,775 --> 00:03:06,162
Alex, you are the one who
wanted to talk about work.

89
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,278
Where are you going?

90
00:03:07,356 --> 00:03:08,826
You made me feel dirty,

91
00:03:08,904 --> 00:03:10,656
- real dirty.
- Oh, my,

92
00:03:10,742 --> 00:03:12,915
I wish I could make you
feel dirty.

93
00:03:12,993 --> 00:03:14,670
Oh, that's nice.
That's real nice.

94
00:03:14,748 --> 00:03:17,445
Alex, couldn't you just,
Oh, my, Where,

95
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:19,789
Come back to bed!

96
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,983
Hey, Chief, um,

97
00:03:30,061 --> 00:03:33,452
I just saw the funding for my
prosthetics project is frozen?

98
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:35,254
Mm, temporarily.
Budget issues.

99
00:03:35,332 --> 00:03:36,491
Oh, man.

100
00:03:36,585 --> 00:03:38,043
We're gonna take that out
on little kids, though?

101
00:03:38,121 --> 00:03:40,467
Yes, and I know it's unfair,
so save it.

102
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:43,171
Whoa.

103
00:03:43,399 --> 00:03:44,530
Morning, Dr. Grey.

104
00:03:44,608 --> 00:03:46,102
Good morning, Dr. Lincoln.

105
00:03:46,191 --> 00:03:48,762
- Who's up, Helm?
- A Mr. Saether.

106
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,474
He's here for his,
Whoa.

107
00:03:51,851 --> 00:03:53,766
Uh, new makeup?

108
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:55,636
Is there
something wrong with it?

109
00:03:55,714 --> 00:03:57,150
- No.
- No.

110
00:04:05,148 --> 00:04:07,331
- Did Papa die?
- No. Andrea!

111
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,936
Why would you say that?

112
00:04:09,014 --> 00:04:10,560
You know why.

113
00:04:10,847 --> 00:04:13,430
Look, just don't let him drag
you into his crazy,

114
00:04:13,508 --> 00:04:14,388
- <i>I know, but,</i>
- Hi.

115
00:04:14,466 --> 00:04:15,967
- Wow.
- Hi.

116
00:04:17,225 --> 00:04:18,309
Do you need something?

117
00:04:18,387 --> 00:04:19,764
Uh, no, nothing. Sorry.

118
00:04:19,842 --> 00:04:23,647
I just, You look really, um,
You look very... uh,

119
00:04:23,725 --> 00:04:25,074
- Capable.
- Capable today.

120
00:04:25,152 --> 00:04:27,680
Thank you. Uh... hi.

121
00:04:39,786 --> 00:04:41,210
What?

122
00:04:41,575 --> 00:04:43,286
I don't want to leave town

123
00:04:43,364 --> 00:04:45,080
when you're
about to make a great

124
00:04:45,158 --> 00:04:46,627
big fool of yourself

125
00:04:46,705 --> 00:04:48,259
over your lady boss.

126
00:04:48,337 --> 00:04:51,255
Oh, shut up.
I'm not,

127
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:53,540
- __
- I'm, No, I'm,

128
00:04:53,618 --> 00:04:54,641
- __
- Shut up.

129
00:04:54,719 --> 00:04:56,476
- __
- I'm not listening.

130
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,122
Small apartment fire.

131
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,574
This guy got
the worst of it.

132
00:05:00,941 --> 00:05:02,994
Let's skip the trauma room and
head straight to the burn unit.

133
00:05:03,072 --> 00:05:03,903
Hold the elevator!

134
00:05:03,981 --> 00:05:05,239
I can take him up.
I know the way.

135
00:05:05,317 --> 00:05:06,452
Thanks, Warren.

136
00:05:10,202 --> 00:05:11,545
Herrera, what did you bring me?

137
00:05:11,623 --> 00:05:13,869
40-year-old female,
unconscious at the scene,

138
00:05:13,947 --> 00:05:17,064
persistently hypotensive,
pulse 120, resps 24.

139
00:05:17,142 --> 00:05:18,221
No evidence of trauma.

140
00:05:18,299 --> 00:05:19,809
Okay.
Any smoke inhalation?

141
00:05:19,887 --> 00:05:21,075
She wasn't even in the fire.

142
00:05:21,153 --> 00:05:22,544
She was evacuated
with the other tenants,

143
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:24,005
and then she collapsed
on the street outside.

144
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:25,439
- Let's get her inside.
- Shoot. - Where'd he go?

145
00:05:25,517 --> 00:05:26,658
- Who?
- Max, her kid.

146
00:05:26,736 --> 00:05:28,394
He was, He was right here.

147
00:05:32,103 --> 00:05:33,536
You Max?

148
00:05:34,021 --> 00:05:36,236
Oh. You okay?
You, You hurt?

149
00:05:36,314 --> 00:05:38,535
- No.
- Oh. Just scared?

150
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:42,503
Yeah, uh, well, you don't
have to be scared.

151
00:05:42,834 --> 00:05:45,332
We're all gonna help
your mom, okay?

152
00:05:46,203 --> 00:05:48,363
You want to come inside
with me?

153
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:53,520
Hey.

154
00:06:06,678 --> 00:06:08,048
Hey. No school?

155
00:06:08,126 --> 00:06:09,905
I have school.
I've been abducted.

156
00:06:09,983 --> 00:06:11,518
She's grounded.
But first we're,

157
00:06:11,596 --> 00:06:13,410
Uh, you're not my mom,
so this is not grounding.

158
00:06:13,488 --> 00:06:15,122
- It's child abduction.
- Go sit.

159
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,888
Transport me across state lines,
it becomes a federal offense.

160
00:06:19,029 --> 00:06:21,894
Schmitt, would you get me
a 10-panel tox screen, please,

161
00:06:21,972 --> 00:06:23,630
- right now?
- Oh, I...

162
00:06:24,393 --> 00:06:25,566
Okay.

163
00:06:25,701 --> 00:06:27,068
Yes, ma'am.

164
00:06:27,604 --> 00:06:29,108
You brought her here
for a drug test

165
00:06:29,186 --> 00:06:31,628
- and she went along with it?
- Well, she doesn't know yet.

166
00:06:31,706 --> 00:06:33,572
Uh, would you watch her?
I got to go change.

167
00:06:33,654 --> 00:06:34,725
Yep.

168
00:06:34,803 --> 00:06:36,248
Hey.

169
00:06:38,657 --> 00:06:40,795
I seriously don't know how you
were ever married to her.

170
00:06:40,873 --> 00:06:42,347
- She is so extra.
- She is a little extra.

171
00:06:42,425 --> 00:06:43,780
Yeah, I agree.

172
00:06:44,443 --> 00:06:45,647
- Meredith.
- <i>Hmm?</i>

173
00:06:45,725 --> 00:06:48,786
If Zola got high, you would
ground her, right?

174
00:06:49,053 --> 00:06:52,147
- What?
- Look at you. What happened?

175
00:06:52,225 --> 00:06:53,389
You have a funeral?

176
00:06:53,467 --> 00:06:55,202
What's wrong with you?
You look weird.

177
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,871
She's wearing makeup.
She looks pretty.

178
00:06:56,949 --> 00:06:58,025
Why?

179
00:06:58,287 --> 00:07:00,029
Oh, my God,
you have a date.

180
00:07:00,107 --> 00:07:01,850
Aaah!
You're doing it!

181
00:07:01,928 --> 00:07:04,702
Aah! You're letting
Mrs. Santa Claus bring you presents!

182
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:06,707
All I got was a lousy tree.

183
00:07:06,785 --> 00:07:07,794
Where are you going?

184
00:07:07,872 --> 00:07:09,489
- Drinks? Coffee?
- Lunch.

185
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:11,011
Lunch?
Lunch is boring.

186
00:07:11,089 --> 00:07:12,794
You can't make lunch last
all night.

187
00:07:12,872 --> 00:07:15,015
So, who is he?
Pics, please.

188
00:07:15,093 --> 00:07:17,425
No, no, that's not how
Mrs. Santa Claus works.

189
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,519
No pictures.

190
00:07:18,597 --> 00:07:21,128
What's she hiding?
Neck beard? Man bun?

191
00:07:21,206 --> 00:07:23,105
- Ear hair?
- No. She wants people to meet

192
00:07:23,183 --> 00:07:24,888
how they meet in real life,

193
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:27,019
with no preconceived notions.

194
00:07:27,097 --> 00:07:28,800
Scary.
I like it.

195
00:07:28,878 --> 00:07:29,914
Damn it.

196
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,045
Have fun.

197
00:07:31,123 --> 00:07:33,903
Cancel your afternoon,
for luck.

198
00:07:38,139 --> 00:07:39,584
What if I hate him on sight?

199
00:07:39,662 --> 00:07:41,764
What's the minimum amount
of time this goes?

200
00:07:41,842 --> 00:07:43,277
Well, assuming your waiter
doesn't suck,

201
00:07:43,355 --> 00:07:45,232
a tight 30 minutes,
if you don't want to hurt his feelings.

202
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:46,403
Okay.

203
00:07:47,983 --> 00:07:50,061
Five bucks says
I can get out in 20

204
00:07:50,139 --> 00:07:51,389
and spare his feelings.

205
00:07:51,467 --> 00:07:52,941
All right, but no pretending
you get paged.

206
00:07:53,019 --> 00:07:55,655
That's cheating.
It's $1 for every minute you go over 20.

207
00:07:55,733 --> 00:07:57,636
I'll text you in 20 minutes.

208
00:07:58,810 --> 00:07:59,907
Oh.

209
00:08:00,018 --> 00:08:01,980
Thank you for making it fun.

210
00:08:05,428 --> 00:08:07,093
Hey, she just went into V-fib.

211
00:08:07,171 --> 00:08:09,193
40-year-old female,
lost consciousness.

212
00:08:09,592 --> 00:08:11,216
Charge to 200.

213
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,766
Clear.

214
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:17,538
- Hey.
- Hey, Natalie.

215
00:08:17,616 --> 00:08:19,558
- Okay. Back in sinus.
- Okay.

216
00:08:19,636 --> 00:08:21,824
You are in the hospital.
You passed out.

217
00:08:21,902 --> 00:08:24,374
Max. Max!

218
00:08:24,743 --> 00:08:26,131
M-My son.

219
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:27,668
Where's my son?

220
00:08:27,746 --> 00:08:28,926
Okay, Natalie,
I need you to be still.

221
00:08:29,004 --> 00:08:30,488
He's right out
in the waiting room.

222
00:08:30,566 --> 00:08:31,733
Bring him here.

223
00:08:31,811 --> 00:08:34,077
I need to see him.
I need to see he's okay.

224
00:08:34,155 --> 00:08:35,641
- Okay. X-ray's there.
- Okay.

225
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:37,962
Sorry. It's just...

226
00:08:38,364 --> 00:08:40,545
Max likes to know
what's going on...

227
00:08:41,306 --> 00:08:42,527
to be told what's gonna happen,

228
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:44,238
or, or he gets scared.

229
00:08:44,316 --> 00:08:45,402
I get that.

230
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,709
He's coming.

231
00:08:47,018 --> 00:08:49,014
She has left ventricular
enlargement,

232
00:08:49,092 --> 00:08:51,105
pulmonary edema,
and a pleural effusion.

233
00:08:51,183 --> 00:08:52,873
- We need a TEE.
- Yep.

234
00:08:53,506 --> 00:08:55,771
I just, just need to...

235
00:08:56,051 --> 00:08:57,273
Just...

236
00:08:57,366 --> 00:08:58,397
Natalie.

237
00:08:58,475 --> 00:09:00,185
Book an OR now.

238
00:09:02,371 --> 00:09:03,466
Mom!

239
00:09:03,601 --> 00:09:05,325
- Mom!
- Max, Max, come here.

240
00:09:05,403 --> 00:09:07,448
- Mom! Mom!
- Hey, please. Come on.

241
00:09:11,304 --> 00:09:13,965

243
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,908
- Sorry. Hey. Are you,
- Hi. Jon?

244
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:45,362
- Yes. Hi.
- Hi.

245
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,500
Uh, they said there's a bit of a wait,
but we can sit at the bar.

246
00:09:47,578 --> 00:09:49,408
Okay.
Let's start the clock.

247
00:09:49,688 --> 00:09:52,914
I just meant, I mean,
let's just get started.

248
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:54,588
Yeah. Okay.

249
00:09:55,651 --> 00:09:57,128
All right.

250
00:09:57,214 --> 00:09:58,901
- That's a nice coat.
- Thank you.

251
00:09:58,979 --> 00:10:00,811
- Nice purse. The whole thing's working.
- Thanks.

252
00:10:00,889 --> 00:10:02,166
Thank you.

253
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:07,826
You, Oh, uh, Max,
we called your dad.

254
00:10:07,904 --> 00:10:09,620
He's on his way.
Your mom is stable.

255
00:10:09,698 --> 00:10:11,291
She's getting prepped
for surgery right now.

256
00:10:11,369 --> 00:10:14,578
Uh, and a nice woman
is on her way to sit with you.

257
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:16,221
I'll sit with you, Max,

258
00:10:16,299 --> 00:10:17,923
until the social worker gets here.

259
00:10:18,001 --> 00:10:20,775
Oh, thanks.
Okay, uh, I'll be back soon.

260
00:10:22,352 --> 00:10:24,296
Did you just put us
on babysitting duty?

261
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:26,253
We have to get checked
by a doctor

262
00:10:26,331 --> 00:10:28,200
after every fire incident now,
anyway, so...

263
00:10:28,278 --> 00:10:30,061
Um, are we really doing that?

264
00:10:30,139 --> 00:10:31,313
Captain's orders.

265
00:10:31,391 --> 00:10:32,510
Sit.

266
00:10:36,501 --> 00:10:39,123
I'm good, guys, yeah.
I'm not even burnt.

267
00:10:39,201 --> 00:10:41,088
I was just delivering food.

268
00:10:41,237 --> 00:10:43,853
Not even my building.
It's not even my fire.

269
00:10:44,192 --> 00:10:45,742
And if the smoke
got into your lungs...

270
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,103
Got to take a look.

271
00:10:47,277 --> 00:10:49,453
It says here your emergency
contact is your mom?

272
00:10:49,531 --> 00:10:50,690
No, don't call my mom!

273
00:10:50,768 --> 00:10:52,691
No, she, she lives in Philly.
She'll just worry.

274
00:10:52,769 --> 00:10:54,884
Also, uh,
I go to U-Dub,

275
00:10:54,984 --> 00:10:57,142
and I have class in an hour,
so, uh, I should,

276
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,597
I'll write you a note. Open wide.

277
00:10:58,675 --> 00:11:00,508
I have a chem test.
Say, "Ahh."

278
00:11:00,586 --> 00:11:02,438
Also, it's a makeup test.

279
00:11:02,526 --> 00:11:04,031
It's like a make-it-or-break-it.

280
00:11:04,109 --> 00:11:05,384
It's my last chance.

281
00:11:05,462 --> 00:11:06,505
I should just go.

282
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,407
You need a chest X-ray first.

283
00:11:08,485 --> 00:11:10,815
X-rays?
Doesn't that cost extra?

284
00:11:10,893 --> 00:11:12,442
Oh, you don't need to worry
about that.

285
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,823
Wait. But...

286
00:11:16,818 --> 00:11:18,230
Max. Buddy.

287
00:11:18,308 --> 00:11:19,939
- Dad!
- Where's Mom?

288
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:22,254
Hi. Are you Natalie's husband?

289
00:11:22,332 --> 00:11:24,269
Yeah. Uh, Evan.
Evan Forrester.

290
00:11:24,347 --> 00:11:26,542
Hey.
I'm Dr. Bailey. This is Dr. Pierce.

291
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,927
Um, has your wife been
complaining of any heart,

292
00:11:29,005 --> 00:11:30,705
H-Hang on. Sorry.

293
00:11:30,887 --> 00:11:32,399
Go ahead. Sit down, son. It's okay.

294
00:11:32,477 --> 00:11:33,714
Go ahead.

295
00:11:33,792 --> 00:11:35,805
<i>Dr. Bradshaw, call Recovery.</i>

296
00:11:35,883 --> 00:11:37,498
<i>Dr. Bradshaw, call Recovery.</i>

297
00:11:37,578 --> 00:11:39,273
We think your wife had
a recent heart attack,

298
00:11:39,351 --> 00:11:41,656
and now the wall between the
two main chambers of her heart

299
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:43,331
- has ruptured.
- Is it,

300
00:11:43,409 --> 00:11:44,719
We won't know how much damage there is

301
00:11:44,797 --> 00:11:46,900
until we can get in there,
but we will keep you updated.

302
00:11:47,077 --> 00:11:48,533
- Okay?
- Okay.

303
00:11:48,737 --> 00:11:50,409
Um, hey.

304
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:53,658
I know you like to know
what's going on.

305
00:11:53,746 --> 00:11:56,956
Okay, so, we're gonna take your
mom to the operating room, okay?

306
00:11:57,034 --> 00:11:58,691
She's having some trouble
with her heart,

307
00:11:58,769 --> 00:12:02,406
but we are gonna do everything
we can to fix her, okay?

308
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:03,698
Okay.

309
00:12:03,854 --> 00:12:05,313
Okay.

310
00:12:05,612 --> 00:12:08,586
<i>Dr. Monroe, call the pharmacy.
Dr. Monroe, call the pharmacy.</i>

311
00:12:08,664 --> 00:12:10,415
Well, I think
we're good to go.

312
00:12:10,493 --> 00:12:12,003
Are we in that big of a rush?

313
00:12:12,081 --> 00:12:15,672
I kind of want to see
how the kid's mom comes out.

314
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,870
And what was her name again?

315
00:12:17,948 --> 00:12:19,125
Uh... The cardio doc.

316
00:12:19,203 --> 00:12:20,742
Dr. Pierce.

317
00:12:21,651 --> 00:12:23,295
Dean. Really?

318
00:12:23,373 --> 00:12:24,796
Did you see that woman?

319
00:12:24,874 --> 00:12:26,601
Did you see her
self-assuredness,

320
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:28,359
her compassion for children,

321
00:12:28,437 --> 00:12:30,828
and her very, very nice eyes?

322
00:12:30,906 --> 00:12:33,916
Look, we also got to wait
for a doctor's check, right?

323
00:12:33,994 --> 00:12:35,640
- Oh, now you want to do that?
- Mm.

324
00:12:35,718 --> 00:12:37,704
Mm-hmm. Captain's orders.

325
00:12:39,518 --> 00:12:41,494
Hey! You still here?

326
00:12:41,572 --> 00:12:43,696
- Hey. Yeah.
- Just, uh, Just heading out.

327
00:12:43,984 --> 00:12:45,873
What have you got
in your hand?

328
00:12:45,955 --> 00:12:47,829
I-I don't have anything in my hand.

329
00:12:48,057 --> 00:12:50,021
Show me your hand.

330
00:12:52,869 --> 00:12:54,729
Uh, I-it's nothing.

331
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:57,009
I-It's nothing, a little burn.

332
00:12:57,307 --> 00:12:59,093
I had to check a door for heat.

333
00:12:59,171 --> 00:13:00,856
It's my first injury.

334
00:13:00,934 --> 00:13:02,811
Had to happen sometime.

335
00:13:07,252 --> 00:13:10,236
You see this thin sac in
the wall of Julius' lung?

336
00:13:10,347 --> 00:13:12,162
He's got a pulmonary bleb.

337
00:13:12,329 --> 00:13:13,993
Ugh. "Bleb."

338
00:13:14,157 --> 00:13:16,854
It's air trapped in
the lining of the lung.

339
00:13:16,932 --> 00:13:19,037
Yeah, I know what it is.
I just hate how it sounds,

340
00:13:19,115 --> 00:13:20,224
"bleb."

341
00:13:20,311 --> 00:13:22,961
- What's it stand for?
- It doesn't. It's a word.

342
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:25,626
It's not a word.
It's a sound effect.

343
00:13:25,744 --> 00:13:26,791
"Bleb."

344
00:13:26,869 --> 00:13:28,345
Well, if it bursts,

345
00:13:28,424 --> 00:13:30,767
his lung collapses,
and Julius dies.

346
00:13:33,042 --> 00:13:35,266
It should be a less funny word.

347
00:13:36,244 --> 00:13:37,354
Suction.

348
00:13:37,513 --> 00:13:40,710
Now, what
is Avery doing, exactly?

349
00:13:40,788 --> 00:13:44,811
I don't, Um,
something to do with God,

350
00:13:44,889 --> 00:13:46,907
uh, and a tree.

351
00:13:46,985 --> 00:13:48,125
Like a sabbatical?

352
00:13:48,203 --> 00:13:49,283
Yeah. Yeah.

353
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:52,354
Uh, exactly, like a,
a spiritual sabbatical.

354
00:13:52,432 --> 00:13:54,213
Where he just decides
overnight

355
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:55,837
to run off and
do what he wants?

356
00:13:56,032 --> 00:13:58,462
Yeah, sounds like
spiritual spring break.

357
00:14:01,472 --> 00:14:04,533
Oh, damn it.
Damn it. You see there?

358
00:14:04,611 --> 00:14:06,898
That is a big
ventricular septal rupture.

359
00:14:06,976 --> 00:14:09,143
She probably had a heart attack
a week ago,

360
00:14:09,221 --> 00:14:10,328
thought it was indigestion,

361
00:14:10,406 --> 00:14:12,187
and now it's just been weakening
ever since.

362
00:14:12,265 --> 00:14:13,557
- Irrigation.
- Yeah.

363
00:14:13,635 --> 00:14:16,117
- What do you want to do?
- I want to close the defect.

364
00:14:16,195 --> 00:14:19,276
Bovine patch.
Herrera said she was down for a while.

365
00:14:20,428 --> 00:14:23,026
I know, but I,
I don't want to go down there

366
00:14:23,104 --> 00:14:25,516
and tell that little boy
that his mother is gone.

367
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:31,876
Uh, let's try a temporary LVAD
and... hope.

368
00:14:37,332 --> 00:14:39,980
- So, you're in software?
- Mm-hmm.

369
00:14:40,058 --> 00:14:42,211
Where is
the T-shirt and hoodie?

370
00:14:42,289 --> 00:14:43,635
I know. I tried.

371
00:14:43,713 --> 00:14:45,882
It just feels like wearing
your pajamas to work,

372
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,054
- you know?
- I do know.

373
00:14:47,132 --> 00:14:49,367
I actually wear my pajamas
to work, sort of.

374
00:14:49,445 --> 00:14:50,898
- I'm a surgeon.
- You are?

375
00:14:50,976 --> 00:14:52,665
- Mm-hmm.
- What kind?

376
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:55,230
Um, I'm Chief of General at Grey-Sloan.

377
00:14:55,308 --> 00:14:56,350
Wow.

378
00:14:56,471 --> 00:14:57,781
So, you're a big deal.

379
00:14:57,859 --> 00:14:58,847
Oh, yeah.

380
00:14:58,925 --> 00:15:00,109
What kind of software?

381
00:15:00,187 --> 00:15:02,071
I'm not supposed to tell you.

382
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:03,644
It's privacy stuff.

383
00:15:03,822 --> 00:15:05,453
Oh. I get it.

384
00:15:05,531 --> 00:15:09,291
No, I mean, it's, uh,
actually privacy software.

385
00:15:09,369 --> 00:15:10,546
- Oh.
- I'm telling you.

386
00:15:10,624 --> 00:15:12,989
I don't care.
I'm terrible at keeping secrets.

387
00:15:13,119 --> 00:15:14,619
I just think
we should be able to decide

388
00:15:14,697 --> 00:15:16,272
what we want to tell the world
about ourselves

389
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:18,109
and... who should get to see it.

390
00:15:18,187 --> 00:15:20,242
My software lets you do that.

391
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,573
- That's all.
- Oh.

392
00:15:21,651 --> 00:15:24,290
So, you're not
mining people's data or...

393
00:15:24,401 --> 00:15:26,804
The opposite, actually,
protecting it.

394
00:15:26,882 --> 00:15:29,049
Mm.
Here's to the good guys.

395
00:15:29,127 --> 00:15:31,023
I mean, I'm not cutting
people's cancer out

396
00:15:31,101 --> 00:15:34,117
- in my pajamas or anything, but...
- Mm. But you do what you can.

397
00:15:34,195 --> 00:15:36,243
I do what I can.

398
00:15:37,262 --> 00:15:39,570
Look, if it bursts,
your lung could collapse.

399
00:15:39,648 --> 00:15:40,799
It puts you at risk.

400
00:15:40,877 --> 00:15:42,377
I know. I know
all about my bleb.

401
00:15:42,455 --> 00:15:43,906
I've had it since I was a baby.

402
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:45,414
Why do you guys call it that?

403
00:15:45,492 --> 00:15:47,307
Right?

404
00:15:47,502 --> 00:15:50,116
Anyway, I'm not doing
a marathon anytime soon,

405
00:15:50,194 --> 00:15:51,772
unless it's video games.

406
00:15:51,869 --> 00:15:54,169
- I'm okay. I get along fine.
- Yeah, until now.

407
00:15:54,247 --> 00:15:56,484
The smoke you inhaled is making
your lungs work harder.

408
00:15:56,562 --> 00:15:58,385
And your bleb is making them
work too hard.

409
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:00,234
But I can operate.
I can take it out for good.

410
00:16:00,312 --> 00:16:01,463
No. No surgery.

411
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:02,549
My mom's insurance,

412
00:16:02,627 --> 00:16:04,643
it, it only covers emergency-room visits.

413
00:16:04,721 --> 00:16:06,635
My stupid bleb's
a pre-existing condition.

414
00:16:06,713 --> 00:16:08,937
If we called your mom, she would
say, "Let's figure it out."

415
00:16:09,015 --> 00:16:10,627
No. No, my mom already works
three jobs

416
00:16:10,705 --> 00:16:12,218
just to keep me
in food and clothes, okay?

417
00:16:12,354 --> 00:16:15,088
The surgery will,
will put us 20 grand in the hole.

418
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:16,570
Just let me out of here, or,

419
00:16:16,648 --> 00:16:18,798
or I'll talk to your supervisor, okay?

420
00:16:19,838 --> 00:16:21,587
I <i>am</i> my supervisor.

421
00:16:22,108 --> 00:16:24,187
Well, Well, don't call my mom.

422
00:16:24,265 --> 00:16:26,959
If you tell my mom,
I'll sue you guys.

423
00:16:27,065 --> 00:16:29,017
Then all of our money problems
will be gone.

424
00:16:29,251 --> 00:16:30,486
Okay?

425
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:34,744
- Can't we just take it out, anyway?
- Kid's 18.

426
00:16:34,822 --> 00:16:36,125
Doing it anyway would be assault.

427
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:38,463
Start him on continuous nebs
and 40% O2

428
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:40,837
- and, uh, slow-roll his discharge.
- Okay.

429
00:16:43,111 --> 00:16:44,445
We need to talk about last night.

430
00:16:44,523 --> 00:16:45,541
That was insulting.

431
00:16:45,619 --> 00:16:47,445
Oh, it was,
and I accept your apology.

432
00:16:47,523 --> 00:16:49,541
You need to apologize to me,
dummy.

433
00:16:49,619 --> 00:16:51,726
I don't have sex with you
because I want stuff from the chief.

434
00:16:51,804 --> 00:16:53,600
I have sex with you 'cause
I want one thing from you,

435
00:16:53,678 --> 00:16:55,124
orgasms!

436
00:16:56,108 --> 00:16:57,532
And maybe you should tell me

437
00:16:57,610 --> 00:16:59,054
when Webber's standing behind me

438
00:16:59,132 --> 00:17:00,681
so I don't say things like that.

439
00:17:07,205 --> 00:17:09,376
You... paged me, Karev?

440
00:17:09,635 --> 00:17:10,899
Has Schmitt been back yet?

441
00:17:10,977 --> 00:17:12,291
Uh, haven't seen him.

442
00:17:12,369 --> 00:17:13,695
What are we even doing here?

443
00:17:13,773 --> 00:17:15,440
Dr. Shepherd, here you go.

444
00:17:15,518 --> 00:17:16,695
Sorry it took so long.

445
00:17:16,773 --> 00:17:18,345
I have a really shy bladder.

446
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,768
What? Why?

447
00:17:19,971 --> 00:17:22,014
Whose is, Why?

448
00:17:22,096 --> 00:17:23,549
You said you wanted a drug test.

449
00:17:23,627 --> 00:17:25,406
I figured because
of that time with the cookies,

450
00:17:25,484 --> 00:17:27,708
- but I am not,
- Not from you.

451
00:17:27,786 --> 00:17:29,540
- For her!
- Yeah.

452
00:17:30,776 --> 00:17:32,252
I am so sorry.

453
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:34,151
Hey, hey, hey.
Take that with you, please.

454
00:17:34,229 --> 00:17:35,578
You brought me here
for a drug test?

455
00:17:35,656 --> 00:17:37,257
- What the hell?!
- Whoa, whoa, workplace.

456
00:17:37,335 --> 00:17:39,125
You're not lying,
so what's the big deal?

457
00:17:39,203 --> 00:17:40,752
The big deal is you trusting me

458
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:42,086
and not treating me
like a criminal.

459
00:17:42,164 --> 00:17:43,498
- Hey. Wh...
- Where are you going?

460
00:17:43,576 --> 00:17:46,525
To daycare, to see Leo. Geez!

461
00:17:49,939 --> 00:17:51,376
This is stupid.

462
00:17:51,454 --> 00:17:53,211
- We're going.
- Hey, we're waiting to get checked.

463
00:17:53,289 --> 00:17:55,328
No. We were waiting.
Now we're stalking.

464
00:17:55,406 --> 00:17:57,093
Any doctor can check us out.

465
00:17:57,171 --> 00:17:59,696
Hey. That's her.
That's her.

466
00:18:00,266 --> 00:18:02,015
Mr. Forrester.

467
00:18:05,577 --> 00:18:07,922
Uh, Natalie's out of surgery.

468
00:18:08,463 --> 00:18:12,099
But the damage to her heart
was very severe.

469
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:14,975
And we had some trouble
getting her off the pump.

470
00:18:15,459 --> 00:18:17,102
I'm so sorry,

471
00:18:17,303 --> 00:18:18,808
but there is only a slim chance

472
00:18:18,886 --> 00:18:21,181
that Natalie will wake up again.

473
00:18:22,922 --> 00:18:25,582
Look, uh, take a few minutes
to talk to your son,

474
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:28,918
and, um, we'll,
we'll take you to see her.

475
00:18:28,996 --> 00:18:30,155
Dad.

476
00:18:30,397 --> 00:18:31,553
Max.

477
00:18:31,709 --> 00:18:32,947
I-Is Mom okay?

478
00:18:33,025 --> 00:18:34,677
Uh, she's, uh,

479
00:18:35,508 --> 00:18:37,193
Mom is, uh...

480
00:18:40,345 --> 00:18:44,833
Max...
your mom was really badly hurt.

481
00:18:45,131 --> 00:18:46,793
And we did everything we could to help,

482
00:18:46,871 --> 00:18:48,462
And it's gonna be all right.

483
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:51,271
She's gonna be all right.

484
00:18:51,962 --> 00:18:53,287
Right?

485
00:19:02,747 --> 00:19:04,380
I mean, dating's not that bad.

486
00:19:04,587 --> 00:19:06,100
I like talking to people...

487
00:19:06,272 --> 00:19:07,896
till you hit the One Thing.

488
00:19:08,475 --> 00:19:10,044
What's the One Thing?

489
00:19:10,122 --> 00:19:12,060
Date's going great, right?

490
00:19:12,334 --> 00:19:15,068
She's smart, you're funny,
you're, you're hitting it off.

491
00:19:15,239 --> 00:19:16,644
And then she says the One Thing,

492
00:19:16,722 --> 00:19:18,998
right, the one, uh,
slightly racist thing.

493
00:19:19,076 --> 00:19:20,633
- Oh, oh.
- Right? Or she, uh,

494
00:19:20,711 --> 00:19:21,933
she tears down her co-workers

495
00:19:22,011 --> 00:19:24,090
or... uses the wrong word
for gay people

496
00:19:24,168 --> 00:19:27,567
or... misuses "their," "they're,"
and "there" in a text.

497
00:19:27,645 --> 00:19:29,061
- That's unforgivable.
- Totally.

498
00:19:29,139 --> 00:19:31,670
I mean, the One Thing
ends the date,

499
00:19:31,748 --> 00:19:33,566
even if you're stuck there
for another hour.

500
00:19:33,644 --> 00:19:35,122
This is why I don't date.

501
00:19:35,221 --> 00:19:37,169
I imagine you're also kind of
married to work.

502
00:19:37,247 --> 00:19:38,871
I have been accused of that,
yeah.

503
00:19:38,949 --> 00:19:40,849
No, wait.
W-Why is that an accusation?

504
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:43,660
It takes a ton of focus for
someone to get where you are,

505
00:19:43,738 --> 00:19:44,890
as young as you are.

506
00:19:44,968 --> 00:19:46,488
Some people don't like
their partner

507
00:19:46,566 --> 00:19:47,920
to be as committed
to their work

508
00:19:47,998 --> 00:19:49,966
as they are to their relationship.
I just don't get it.

509
00:19:50,055 --> 00:19:51,297
Is that why you're single?

510
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:53,349
Yeah. My wife couldn't share.

511
00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:54,795
You?

512
00:19:54,873 --> 00:19:57,530
Mm, he could share,
but he died.

513
00:19:58,346 --> 00:20:00,302
- I'm sorry.
- Thank you.

514
00:20:01,388 --> 00:20:02,522
Yeah.

515
00:20:02,733 --> 00:20:05,082
Work's a very forgiving partner,
but it doesn't really,

516
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,177
Throw you up against the wall
and kiss you.

517
00:20:07,424 --> 00:20:08,793
I was gonna say scratch
your back,

518
00:20:08,871 --> 00:20:10,192
but I like yours, too.

519
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:16,607
Actually, if you don't mind,
I'm just going to,

520
00:20:16,685 --> 00:20:19,419
uh, call work and move some
things around this afternoon.

521
00:20:19,497 --> 00:20:20,966
- Yeah, sure. Okay.
- Okay.

522
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:29,909
- Oh, God.
- What?

523
00:20:29,987 --> 00:20:33,179
This is, um, I'm sorry
to have to tell you this.

524
00:20:33,257 --> 00:20:36,275
I-I thought you didn't
look like your picture,

525
00:20:36,353 --> 00:20:38,504
and it's because it's, um,

526
00:20:38,949 --> 00:20:40,832
it's her picture.

527
00:20:42,713 --> 00:20:44,803
Yeah. I'm supposed to be
on a date with her.

528
00:20:45,106 --> 00:20:47,193
- Are you Jon?
- Yeah. I am.

529
00:20:47,271 --> 00:20:49,086
But it's a pretty common name.

530
00:20:49,239 --> 00:20:50,583
Do you want to go over there?

531
00:20:50,661 --> 00:20:52,980
I don't. I'm enjoying this.

532
00:20:53,263 --> 00:20:55,221
Well, she looks like

533
00:20:55,299 --> 00:20:56,933
she's having a good time over there.

534
00:20:57,638 --> 00:21:01,925
So... do you think that's my Jon?

535
00:21:07,077 --> 00:21:08,785
You call his mother,
you break HIPAA.

536
00:21:08,863 --> 00:21:10,957
You break HIPAA, we get sued.

537
00:21:11,215 --> 00:21:12,699
So, what do I do?

538
00:21:13,325 --> 00:21:15,593
You know, Karev,
the only thing less fun

539
00:21:15,671 --> 00:21:17,010
than watching you do this job

540
00:21:17,088 --> 00:21:18,262
is doing it for you.

541
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,556
Look, this isn't a chief thing.

542
00:21:19,634 --> 00:21:20,838
- This,
- lt, It is.

543
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:22,145
I mean, being chief is...

544
00:21:22,223 --> 00:21:24,040
nothing but being backed
into corners.

545
00:21:24,118 --> 00:21:26,384
The trick is finding
creative ways to get out.

546
00:21:26,462 --> 00:21:28,911
Well, then I've found one.
I'm telling Bailey I quit.

547
00:21:28,989 --> 00:21:30,485
- You can have this stupid job.
- No.

548
00:21:30,563 --> 00:21:31,891
No, you have been
pissy about this

549
00:21:31,969 --> 00:21:34,758
- since the day I started.
- I mean you are not allowed to quit,

550
00:21:34,836 --> 00:21:36,796
okay? You may only quit
after you've done it

551
00:21:36,874 --> 00:21:39,402
to the best of your ability
and decided to, okay?

552
00:21:39,545 --> 00:21:42,034
Otherwise, it's not quitting.
It's failing.

553
00:21:42,139 --> 00:21:44,643
Now, my mother told me that,
and it's true.

554
00:21:45,057 --> 00:21:46,739
So, what were you quitting, med school?

555
00:21:46,817 --> 00:21:49,035
I didn't want to play tetherball.
I was 10.

556
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:50,328
This isn't tetherball.

557
00:21:50,406 --> 00:21:52,119
Oh, it's all tetherball, Karev.

558
00:21:52,197 --> 00:21:53,380
Look, kick its ass

559
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:55,497
and then decide
you don't want it.

560
00:21:55,575 --> 00:21:57,445
Don't let it decide
it doesn't want you.

561
00:21:57,523 --> 00:21:59,661
I, Aah!

562
00:22:04,581 --> 00:22:05,992
- Ah.
- We get our doc checks

563
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:07,998
from the chief of surgery?

564
00:22:08,098 --> 00:22:09,829
Is that the best use of resources?

565
00:22:09,907 --> 00:22:11,236
I'm on sabbatical.

566
00:22:11,314 --> 00:22:13,242
You look good. Miller, sit.

567
00:22:13,471 --> 00:22:14,658
The right finger.

568
00:22:14,736 --> 00:22:17,250
He was hoping for
Dr. Pierce.

569
00:22:17,328 --> 00:22:18,692
Open.

570
00:22:19,329 --> 00:22:21,215
- Ah.
- Um, do you, do you know,

571
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:23,617
do you know if she's single,
Dr. Pierce?

572
00:22:23,695 --> 00:22:25,472
Do I look like your auntie, Miller?

573
00:22:25,715 --> 00:22:27,511
All right,
you're all checked out.

574
00:22:29,388 --> 00:22:31,629
Uh, hey, question,

575
00:22:31,755 --> 00:22:33,833
who was first into this apartment fire?

576
00:22:33,911 --> 00:22:35,655
- It was... Warren and Hughes.
- War... Warren.

577
00:22:35,733 --> 00:22:38,066
- Why?
- Was that the best use of resources?

578
00:22:38,278 --> 00:22:41,782
I mean, he's the only surgeon
on a team of firefighters.

579
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,237
Don't you want to protect
those hands?

580
00:22:47,442 --> 00:22:50,483
"So sorry. I would never want
to stand you up."

581
00:22:50,561 --> 00:22:51,905
"Something has come up."

582
00:22:51,983 --> 00:22:55,769
"Something unavoidable
has come up,

583
00:22:55,991 --> 00:22:58,666
and I can't
make it there."

584
00:22:58,744 --> 00:23:00,546
That look good?

585
00:23:01,146 --> 00:23:03,229
Yep. But just change
the "there"

586
00:23:03,307 --> 00:23:05,018
to the wrong "their",
that'll soften the blow.

587
00:23:05,096 --> 00:23:06,543
Oh, that is good.

588
00:23:06,978 --> 00:23:09,074
- Okay? One, two, three.
- Yep.

589
00:23:15,461 --> 00:23:17,783
And just like that,
we're yesterday's news.

590
00:23:17,889 --> 00:23:19,655
Maybe they're
falling in love.

591
00:23:20,042 --> 00:23:22,180
Maybe this is
meant to be.

592
00:23:22,258 --> 00:23:23,663
Good luck to them.

593
00:23:23,812 --> 00:23:26,161
We should, uh,
We should get out of here

594
00:23:26,239 --> 00:23:28,220
- before they see us.
- Okay.

595
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:32,859
Just,
Be cool.

596
00:23:32,937 --> 00:23:34,523
- Yeah, just be cool, will you?
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.

597
00:23:34,601 --> 00:23:35,949
- You're just freaking out right now.
- Okay.

598
00:23:36,027 --> 00:23:37,333
You're drawing a lot of
attention to us.

599
00:23:37,411 --> 00:23:38,747
Go. Go. Go.

600
00:23:39,299 --> 00:23:41,197
It's not fair.
When Leo is 15,

601
00:23:41,275 --> 00:23:42,895
you'll have had 14 years
to get ready.

602
00:23:42,973 --> 00:23:44,936
Mm.
If I get to keep him.

603
00:23:45,286 --> 00:23:47,156
Okay.
I'm just saying,

604
00:23:47,234 --> 00:23:48,858
I don't know
how to discipline a teenager.

605
00:23:48,936 --> 00:23:50,064
You were one.

606
00:23:50,142 --> 00:23:51,158
What did your mom do?

607
00:23:51,236 --> 00:23:53,046
- Nothing.
- Wh...

608
00:23:53,454 --> 00:23:55,531
She ruled with an iron fist
over her first four kids,

609
00:23:55,609 --> 00:23:57,585
but I was her kryptonite.

610
00:23:57,887 --> 00:24:00,707
I think once my father died
in front of me,

611
00:24:00,785 --> 00:24:03,195
she was
afraid to upset me.

612
00:24:03,273 --> 00:24:05,375
She just... let me do
whatever I wanted.

613
00:24:05,453 --> 00:24:06,851
Oh, my mom was
the opposite.

614
00:24:06,929 --> 00:24:08,005
When my dad died,
she became

615
00:24:08,083 --> 00:24:10,481
Mom, Dad,
judge, jury, and executioner

616
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:12,296
for me and Megan.
Yeah.

617
00:24:12,691 --> 00:24:15,429
Well... you turned out okay.

618
00:24:15,507 --> 00:24:17,483
Eh. I hope so.

619
00:24:19,917 --> 00:24:22,928
You know, sometimes
I think parenting, it's just...

620
00:24:23,391 --> 00:24:25,288
Okay, fine.

621
00:24:29,557 --> 00:24:31,756
Whoa. What?

622
00:24:32,533 --> 00:24:34,012
Hey.

623
00:24:34,575 --> 00:24:37,298
Hey, Max,
what are you doing down here?

624
00:24:39,665 --> 00:24:41,723
Is my mom
gonna be okay?

625
00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:44,897
Max.

626
00:24:48,141 --> 00:24:50,936
Um, Max, the problem...

627
00:24:51,852 --> 00:24:54,223
that your mom has
is a big one.

628
00:24:54,714 --> 00:24:57,592
So, her heart, which pumps
all the blood through her body,

629
00:24:57,961 --> 00:24:59,431
is pretty badly damaged.

630
00:24:59,509 --> 00:25:01,046
- It's, It's,
- There you are!

631
00:25:01,428 --> 00:25:04,133
You can't go running off
like that, buddy, please.

632
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:05,792
She was telling me about Mom.

633
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:07,224
Is there a change?

634
00:25:07,302 --> 00:25:09,505
Can I speak to you for a sec?

635
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:11,607
Look, I-I just went to the restroom,

636
00:25:11,685 --> 00:25:14,439
and, and, and when
he's scared, he likes to hide.

637
00:25:14,517 --> 00:25:16,116
Yeah. Um...

638
00:25:16,246 --> 00:25:18,475
he probably gets that from you.

639
00:25:19,148 --> 00:25:20,117
I'm sorry?

640
00:25:20,195 --> 00:25:22,225
Look, I know you're
trying to protect Max,

641
00:25:22,684 --> 00:25:25,003
but he needs to know
what's coming.

642
00:25:25,266 --> 00:25:26,455
You don't know my kid.

643
00:25:26,533 --> 00:25:28,638
I know that any kid needs
to be prepared

644
00:25:28,716 --> 00:25:30,493
for what is going to happen
to his mother.

645
00:25:30,571 --> 00:25:32,156
You said there's still a chance.

646
00:25:32,234 --> 00:25:33,665
I said there was a slim chance.

647
00:25:33,743 --> 00:25:35,450
That's still a chance!

648
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:38,217
Max, let's go, buddy.

649
00:25:38,991 --> 00:25:41,405
And I'm not gonna
take that away from him.

650
00:25:42,416 --> 00:25:44,553
Please don't talk to my son.

651
00:25:45,757 --> 00:25:47,642
<i>Dr. Hoffman to Oncology.</i>

652
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:50,223
<i>Dr. Hoffman to Oncology.</i>

653
00:25:50,918 --> 00:25:52,003
What happened?

654
00:25:52,158 --> 00:25:53,420
He's trying to leave.

655
00:25:53,498 --> 00:25:55,171
He got winded putting on
his pants.

656
00:25:55,398 --> 00:25:56,755
It's because
your lungs aren't working right.

657
00:25:56,833 --> 00:25:58,284
Come on, pal.

658
00:25:58,362 --> 00:26:00,789
His pulse ox was just 88
on room air.

659
00:26:00,867 --> 00:26:02,817
Look, Julius,
you still haven't recovered fully

660
00:26:02,895 --> 00:26:04,035
from the smoke inhalation.

661
00:26:04,113 --> 00:26:06,776
And this bleb, it, it,
it could burst out there,

662
00:26:06,854 --> 00:26:09,120
in the middle of chem class,
when I'm not there to help you.

663
00:26:09,198 --> 00:26:10,238
The insurance,

664
00:26:10,316 --> 00:26:12,108
it was really c-clear.

665
00:26:12,186 --> 00:26:14,103
This was pre-exi... existing.

666
00:26:14,181 --> 00:26:15,644
I-I can't afford this.

667
00:26:15,722 --> 00:26:17,058
I got to go.

668
00:26:20,502 --> 00:26:23,436
Okay, uh, just, uh, um, lie back.

669
00:26:23,514 --> 00:26:24,413
Let me check you
before you leave.

670
00:26:24,491 --> 00:26:27,162
Wait. Le...
H-He's just gonna leave AMA?

671
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,416
Yeah. He's allowed
to refuse care.

672
00:26:29,494 --> 00:26:32,294
Legally, we can't force you
to have treatment.

673
00:26:35,293 --> 00:26:36,909
What is this?

674
00:26:38,786 --> 00:26:39,944
W-What did you do?

675
00:26:40,022 --> 00:26:41,709
He has a penetrating chest wound.

676
00:26:41,787 --> 00:26:43,220
I mean, how did we miss this?

677
00:26:43,298 --> 00:26:45,506
- I didn't.
- Well, I mean, it's right there.

678
00:26:45,584 --> 00:26:47,449
I mean, this could be
invading the pleural space.

679
00:26:47,527 --> 00:26:49,238
We got to take a look in surgery.

680
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:50,816
No, I-I can't have surgery.

681
00:26:50,894 --> 00:26:53,342
Dude, listen,
it's an emergency surgery,

682
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:55,458
so it's covered under your insurance...

683
00:26:55,811 --> 00:26:58,641
and anything else
that we find in there.

684
00:26:59,199 --> 00:27:00,800
Do you understand?

685
00:27:01,241 --> 00:27:02,280
Yeah.

686
00:27:02,486 --> 00:27:03,499
All right. Okay.

687
00:27:03,577 --> 00:27:04,754
All right, Qadri, um,

688
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:07,091
send off pre-op labs and book an OR.

689
00:27:08,427 --> 00:27:10,242
Dr. Karev...

690
00:27:10,417 --> 00:27:12,006
I have to report this.

691
00:27:12,084 --> 00:27:13,974
Well, you just told the chief.

692
00:27:21,287 --> 00:27:23,492
Mom? Mom, are you okay?
What do you need?

693
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:25,122
Nothing.
I'm not here to see you.

694
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,451
I have a life, Owen.
Good Lord.

695
00:27:28,161 --> 00:27:30,249
No. We're going, Miller.

696
00:27:30,327 --> 00:27:31,632
We, We've hung around
long enough.

697
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:33,934
But we should tell Dr. Pierce
we're leaving, though, right?

698
00:27:34,012 --> 00:27:36,480
You know, close the circle.
Hey, Dr. Pierce.

699
00:27:36,558 --> 00:27:38,428
- Hey.
- Hey.

700
00:27:40,382 --> 00:27:42,973
Uh, Dean. Miller. Dean.

701
00:27:43,051 --> 00:27:44,638
Ah.

702
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:48,320
- What's up?
- Uh... I was wondering

703
00:27:48,398 --> 00:27:50,421
how that lady was doing,

704
00:27:50,499 --> 00:27:52,075
the, that poor kid's mom.

705
00:27:52,153 --> 00:27:54,452
- Oh. Yeah, not good.
- Mnh.

706
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:56,169
There was too much
damage to repair.

707
00:27:56,247 --> 00:27:58,400
Wow.
That's... too bad.

708
00:27:58,478 --> 00:27:59,623
Yeah.

709
00:28:05,593 --> 00:28:07,864
- Was there something else?
- Uh, yes, yes.

710
00:28:07,942 --> 00:28:11,264
Um,
just trying to pivot from that.

711
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:13,687
I kind of set myself up badly.

712
00:28:13,765 --> 00:28:15,656
- For?
- I was, I was, I was wondering

713
00:28:15,734 --> 00:28:17,768
if you would like to
get dinner with me sometime.

714
00:28:18,578 --> 00:28:19,740
Oh.

715
00:28:19,937 --> 00:28:20,937
Oh!

716
00:28:21,038 --> 00:28:25,100
Um... well, Dean...

717
00:28:25,767 --> 00:28:26,950
Don't have to laugh.

718
00:28:27,028 --> 00:28:29,201
No, no, I just,

719
00:28:29,429 --> 00:28:33,295
I, uh,
I had a fiancé named Dean once.

720
00:28:33,655 --> 00:28:35,451
This is, This is going great.

721
00:28:35,952 --> 00:28:37,367
Dr. Pierce...

722
00:28:37,445 --> 00:28:38,796
Natalie Forrester coded again.

723
00:28:38,874 --> 00:28:40,958
We brought her back,
but she's circling the drain.

724
00:28:41,036 --> 00:28:42,356
I have to go.

725
00:28:44,234 --> 00:28:47,498
I am so glad
we waited.

726
00:28:48,114 --> 00:28:49,726
So glad.

727
00:28:50,851 --> 00:28:52,294
What the hell, Karev?

728
00:28:52,372 --> 00:28:54,012
Oh, Qadri reported me?

729
00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:57,351
She did her job.
You stabbed a patient?

730
00:28:57,429 --> 00:29:00,147
Look, you said
find a creative solution, right?

731
00:29:00,419 --> 00:29:03,835
I didn't say commit assault
or insurance fraud.

732
00:29:03,913 --> 00:29:06,333
I mean, if this is your way of
getting out of being interim chief,

733
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:07,921
congratulations.
It'll likely get you

734
00:29:07,999 --> 00:29:09,083
out of being a doctor at all.

735
00:29:09,161 --> 00:29:10,458
Look, I'm just
kicking the job's ass

736
00:29:10,536 --> 00:29:12,598
before it kicks mine,
like your mother said.

737
00:29:12,676 --> 00:29:15,554
No, no. You do not get to use
my mother's words against me.

738
00:29:15,632 --> 00:29:18,108
Well, let me tell you something
my mother used to say,

739
00:29:18,278 --> 00:29:20,686
"Bats!
There are bats everywhere, Alex,

740
00:29:20,796 --> 00:29:22,821
and they know
everybody's phone numbers."

741
00:29:22,976 --> 00:29:25,326
So, how about you let me borrow
your mom for a minute?

742
00:29:28,832 --> 00:29:30,601
Of course
it was the right thing.

743
00:29:30,679 --> 00:29:32,419
You drug-test her,
and you ground her.

744
00:29:32,497 --> 00:29:33,874
What's the problem?

745
00:29:33,952 --> 00:29:35,309
Well, I just have no authority.

746
00:29:35,387 --> 00:29:36,618
I-I'm not her mother or,

747
00:29:36,696 --> 00:29:38,426
- What are you?
- I don't know.

748
00:29:38,504 --> 00:29:41,999
Her friend?
Or her sponsor maybe?

749
00:29:42,077 --> 00:29:43,919
I-I'm trying to be
whatever she needs.

750
00:29:43,997 --> 00:29:46,092
She needs a damn mother,
sounds like.

751
00:29:46,382 --> 00:29:47,544
So, I should push it?

752
00:29:47,622 --> 00:29:49,401
You're building a boat.

753
00:29:50,215 --> 00:29:51,215
A boat?

754
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:53,498
It's what I used to tell
Owen's dad.

755
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:55,661
They're gonna
sail away from us, I said.

756
00:29:55,739 --> 00:29:56,916
It's inevitable.

757
00:29:56,994 --> 00:30:00,158
Our job is to
build a boat strong enough

758
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:02,245
that, when they decide to,

759
00:30:02,323 --> 00:30:04,424
they can get back to us safely.

760
00:30:05,432 --> 00:30:06,870
Right.

761
00:30:08,503 --> 00:30:12,665
So, I need to be firm,
use tough wood,

762
00:30:12,745 --> 00:30:14,063
and hammer in the nails with,

763
00:30:14,141 --> 00:30:16,289
You're not building
an actual boat.

764
00:30:16,367 --> 00:30:18,633
The boat is your relationship with,

765
00:30:18,711 --> 00:30:20,477
Right.
No. I-I got it.

766
00:30:20,555 --> 00:30:21,859
Thank you.

767
00:30:23,643 --> 00:30:25,536
Let me ask you this.

768
00:30:25,832 --> 00:30:27,758
Are you and Owen
back together?

769
00:30:27,836 --> 00:30:30,260
I can't tell,
and he won't say.

770
00:30:30,703 --> 00:30:33,672
Uh, I don't know.
I think we're just kind of,

771
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:36,580
Raising some kids together
or whatever?

772
00:30:37,932 --> 00:30:39,258
Lord.

773
00:30:39,502 --> 00:30:41,912
Do you have an opinion
either way?

774
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:43,903
Of course I do, dear.

00:30:44,174 --> 00:30:45,720

839
00:33:39,091 --> 00:33:40,765
I wouldn't say he's lying, Max.

840
00:33:40,843 --> 00:33:42,342
He's just trying to...

841
00:33:43,296 --> 00:33:44,917
Look, when I was in college,

842
00:33:45,111 --> 00:33:47,618
my mom went to go visit
my sister in Italy.

843
00:33:47,807 --> 00:33:50,244
And one day, my sister calls me,
and she says,

844
00:33:50,322 --> 00:33:52,644
"You have to come home right now.
Mom's really sick."

845
00:33:53,213 --> 00:33:56,493
So, I flew home,
and when I got there...

846
00:33:58,263 --> 00:34:00,876
she had died of a stroke.

847
00:34:01,908 --> 00:34:04,041
But the truth is, she was already dead

848
00:34:04,119 --> 00:34:05,581
before my sister even called me.

849
00:34:05,659 --> 00:34:07,929
- Your sister lied?
- Mm-hmm.

850
00:34:08,007 --> 00:34:09,642
Yeah. She did.

851
00:34:09,855 --> 00:34:12,778
And believe me, Max,
I was so mad at her.

852
00:34:12,856 --> 00:34:15,009
But then she said,

853
00:34:16,619 --> 00:34:20,172
"I couldn't have you find out
without me being there to hug you."

854
00:34:20,939 --> 00:34:23,226
- And then I understood.
- So, my dad <i>is</i> lying?

855
00:34:23,304 --> 00:34:25,190
- No.
- Is my mom gonna die?

856

No, Max, I just mean,

857
00:34:26,549 --> 00:34:28,369
- Is she dead already?
- Max, no.

858
00:34:28,447 --> 00:34:31,018
I just mean it's hard
to face the truth sometimes.

859
00:34:31,096 --> 00:34:32,453

Thanks. I had a meeting.

866
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:50,059
Hey! How was your date?

867
00:34:50,137 --> 00:34:51,786
Oh. Oh, that kind of meeting.

868
00:34:51,864 --> 00:34:52,751
Oh, let's not.

869
00:34:52,829 --> 00:34:54,738
- Please, let's do.
- Yeah.

870
00:34:54,914 --> 00:34:57,537
- I hate people.
- Oh, thank God.

871
00:34:58,284 --> 00:34:59,713
This man's wife is dying,

872
00:34:59,791 --> 00:35:01,908
and he's not gonna tell his kid
until after she's already dead,

873
00:35:01,986 --> 00:35:04,689
when it's too late
for him to say goodbye.

874
00:35:06,029 --> 00:35:08,041
- You.
- Me?

875
00:35:08,119 --> 00:35:09,970
Yeah, you should answer this for me.

876
00:35:10,048 --> 00:35:11,991
If you see a disaster coming

877
00:35:12,069 --> 00:35:14,822
and you have to break
patient confidentiality

878
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:16,285
to prevent it,

879
00:35:16,387 --> 00:35:17,784
don't you do that?

880
00:35:17,862 --> 00:35:21,958
Like, I-I should tell you,
right, uh, them, him?

881
00:35:22,036 --> 00:35:23,502
Well, it's an oath.

882
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:26,957
And as wrong as it feels,
is it your business?

883
00:35:27,803 --> 00:35:29,526
I hate people.

884
00:35:30,382 --> 00:35:32,598
So, how did it go?

885
00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:34,583
Horribly.

886
00:35:34,896 --> 00:35:37,637
I liked him a lot.
We found each other delightful.

887
00:35:38,073 --> 00:35:40,773
And I thought, "Hey,
could it really be this easy?

888
00:35:40,851 --> 00:35:42,054
How is that horrible?

889
00:35:42,132 --> 00:35:43,842
Because then he said the One Thing,

890
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:44,890
that he hates kids

891
00:35:44,968 --> 00:35:46,980
and that he finds
single mothers desperate.

892
00:35:47,058 --> 00:35:49,286
Right. Okay.
Next time!

893
00:35:49,364 --> 00:35:51,281
Right. I don't think
there'll be a next time.

894
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:53,711
Don't!
Don't give up!

895
00:35:54,001 --> 00:35:56,869
For what it's worth, it,
it sounds like a great date.

896
00:35:56,947 --> 00:35:58,690
I mean,
if he hadn't said that thing,

897
00:35:58,768 --> 00:36:00,207
you might have given it a go,

898
00:36:00,285 --> 00:36:02,643
and then he would have probably
tried to hide his feelings

899
00:36:02,721 --> 00:36:05,585
and the truth might not come out
for months or years.

900
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:09,044
So, I mean, you found out
there are good men out there,

901
00:36:09,122 --> 00:36:11,301
and you dodged
a very slow-moving bullet.

902
00:36:11,483 --> 00:36:14,543
I'd call that a good use of your time.

903
00:36:15,475 --> 00:36:17,163
Thanks, Herrera.

904
00:36:17,762 --> 00:36:19,487
<i>Dr. Mahoney to the ER.</i>

905
00:36:19,565 --> 00:36:21,301
<i>Dr. Mahoney to the ER.</i>

906
00:36:22,474 --> 00:36:23,571
Hey.

907
00:36:23,649 --> 00:36:24,863
Hey.

908
00:36:24,941 --> 00:36:26,352
Have you seen a kid, 10 years old?

909
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:28,167
You've lost a child, Andrea?

910
00:36:28,245 --> 00:36:30,082
I didn't lose a child.
I'm looking for one.

911
00:36:30,201 --> 00:36:32,285
- Okay.
- Oh, uh, did you hear from Papa?

912
00:36:32,727 --> 00:36:34,732
It's, uh, Just go.

913
00:36:34,810 --> 00:36:36,099
Go find your kid, yeah?

914
00:36:36,177 --> 00:36:37,162
- All right. Okay.
- Yeah.

915
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:38,541
Oh, oh, uh, Carina?

916
00:36:38,619 --> 00:36:39,928
What?

917
00:36:40,063 --> 00:36:41,786
You're a really good sister.

918
00:36:45,389 --> 00:36:46,822
Max.

919
00:36:47,325 --> 00:36:48,325
Max?

920
00:36:53,775 --> 00:36:55,746
Bye-bye, bleb.

921
00:36:56,077 --> 00:36:58,060
Now he'll breathe without a problem,

922
00:36:58,138 --> 00:36:59,674
and he doesn't have to worry

923
00:36:59,752 --> 00:37:01,918
about the thing bursting on its own.

924
00:37:02,241 --> 00:37:04,230
Well, I understand the medicine, Karev.

925
00:37:04,438 --> 00:37:05,526
What I'm not so sure of

926
00:37:05,604 --> 00:37:07,279
is how you plan
to tell his mother

927
00:37:07,424 --> 00:37:09,605
and a medical ethics committee.

928
00:37:09,996 --> 00:37:13,254
I'll probably tell them about
the time that I stole a car.

929
00:37:16,013 --> 00:37:18,166
One night, my baby sister, Amber,

930
00:37:18,244 --> 00:37:19,317
had the flu.

931
00:37:19,395 --> 00:37:21,738
She spiked a fever of 104.

932
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:25,073
I was 12, home alone,
didn't know what to do.

933
00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:27,726
So I broke into
the neighbor's house,

934
00:37:27,804 --> 00:37:30,568
stole the car keys,
and took her to the hospital,

935
00:37:30,646 --> 00:37:32,794
where there were people
who <i>would</i> know what to do.

936
00:37:32,877 --> 00:37:34,499
Why didn't you just call
an ambulance?

937
00:37:34,614 --> 00:37:36,996
You know how much
an ambulance ride costs?

938
00:37:37,563 --> 00:37:39,582
I think I'll get a pass from his mom.

939
00:37:39,962 --> 00:37:43,343
And I'm hoping there's no need
to face an ethics committee.

940
00:37:44,347 --> 00:37:45,941
3-0 Vicryl?

941
00:37:47,876 --> 00:37:50,535
- Can't you drive me home?
- Amelia's gonna do it.

942
00:37:50,689 --> 00:37:52,105
How do you even deal with her?

943
00:37:52,183 --> 00:37:54,510
Well, for one thing,
I don't lie to her.

944
00:37:55,303 --> 00:37:57,129
And, also, I accept her.

945
00:37:58,033 --> 00:38:00,412
I accept that
she will be a little intense,

946
00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:02,229
a little too much sometimes

947
00:38:02,307 --> 00:38:04,417
because she cares so much.

948
00:38:04,784 --> 00:38:07,286
She's trying to help you,
and if you let her,

949
00:38:07,364 --> 00:38:09,855
she might stop
driving you so crazy.

950
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,407
Did you take the drug test?

951
00:38:15,485 --> 00:38:16,595
No.

952
00:38:16,715 --> 00:38:19,916
Well, uh, I will show you
where the bathroom is.

953
00:38:19,994 --> 00:38:21,543
I smoked some weed.

954
00:38:22,770 --> 00:38:24,015
Me and a friend.

955
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:25,994
It wasn't heroin. It wasn't pills.

956
00:38:26,072 --> 00:38:27,557
It was just weed.

957
00:38:27,635 --> 00:38:31,223
There's no "just weed," okay?

958
00:38:31,301 --> 00:38:35,194
Because when a junkie
smokes weed or drinks,

959
00:38:35,272 --> 00:38:37,786
we sometimes forget
to not do heroin.

960
00:38:37,864 --> 00:38:39,959
It triggers cravings,
all of it, Betty.

961
00:38:40,037 --> 00:38:41,205
And you've been to plenty of meetings,

962
00:38:41,283 --> 00:38:43,004
so I think you know that already.

963
00:38:43,812 --> 00:38:45,008
Okay?

964
00:38:45,252 --> 00:38:48,207
So... you're grounded.

965
00:38:48,536 --> 00:38:50,677
One month, no friends,

966
00:38:50,755 --> 00:38:52,783
- no hanging out after school.
- Wait. One month?

967
00:38:52,861 --> 00:38:53,919
Are you crazy?

968
00:38:53,997 --> 00:38:55,267
- Amelia,
- Shh! I am building a boat.

969
00:38:55,345 --> 00:38:56,966
One month, you go to school,

970
00:38:57,044 --> 00:38:58,560
you come home and go to meetings.

971
00:38:58,638 --> 00:39:00,221
That is it.
Then we'll talk.

972
00:39:00,299 --> 00:39:02,394
Oh, my God.
Okay, yeah, whatever.

973
00:39:02,472 --> 00:39:04,854
You are so lame.
You are both so lame.

974
00:39:04,932 --> 00:39:06,434
I'll be in the car.

975
00:39:09,409 --> 00:39:11,666
- We are lame.
- We're so lame.

976
00:39:14,976 --> 00:39:17,585
Hi, Julius.
Surgery went well.

977
00:39:17,663 --> 00:39:19,513
We removed the bleb with no problem,

978
00:39:19,591 --> 00:39:22,055
and you have
two very healthy lungs.

979
00:39:22,133 --> 00:39:23,921
You stab people?

980
00:39:23,999 --> 00:39:25,990
