00:00:00,738 --> 00:00:04,883
Just like we need food
and water, humans need each other.

This is kind of a lot.

9
00:00:20,074 --> 00:00:21,129
Don't you think?

10
00:00:21,206 --> 00:00:22,320
Stop judging me.

11
00:00:22,397 --> 00:00:23,841
I really can't.

15
00:00:32,065 --> 00:00:34,642
A brain study revealed that,
when placed in an MRI,

16
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:36,734
a patient's reward center
lit up

17
00:00:36,811 --> 00:00:39,505
when another person sat
in the room.

18
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:44,029
Neurons fire
when we talk to someone,

19
00:00:44,204 --> 00:00:45,802
think about someone,

20
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:48,460
and they go haywire
when we hold someone's hand.

21
00:00:48,537 --> 00:00:50,005

00:00:58,246 --> 00:00:59,348
Oh, okay, bedroom,

28
00:00:59,425 --> 00:01:01,740
- bedroom. Ah!
- Okay. Good idea.

29
00:01:02,707 --> 00:01:04,436
- Betty's still awake.
- Oh.

30
00:01:04,513 --> 00:01:06,732
Oh, and so is Leo.

31
00:01:06,837 --> 00:01:07,954
Okay, I'll just, uh...

32
00:01:08,031 --> 00:01:10,098
Our brains and bodies
are actually programmed

33
00:01:10,175 --> 00:01:11,768
to seek each other out
and connect.

35
00:01:14,219 --> 00:01:17,187
So, then why do so many people
prefer being alone?

36
00:01:17,264 --> 00:01:19,177
Have you been
home all night?

37
00:01:19,343 --> 00:01:21,044
I just got here.

38
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,430
Do you dream vividly?

39
00:01:24,507 --> 00:01:27,187
Like, so vivid, you can feel
how the dream felt

40
00:01:27,264 --> 00:01:28,840
in your whole body?

41
00:01:28,917 --> 00:01:29,976
What's with all the milk?

42
00:01:30,053 --> 00:01:32,638
I almost slept
with Owen.

43
00:01:33,517 --> 00:01:35,010
- So, you bought milk?
- No.

44
00:01:35,087 --> 00:01:36,840
The baby woke up,
it was awkward,

45
00:01:36,917 --> 00:01:38,636
so I came over here
to get clothes.

46
00:01:38,713 --> 00:01:39,804
Why is everyone awake?

47
00:01:39,881 --> 00:01:40,840
Uh...

48
00:01:40,917 --> 00:01:42,067
Jackson proposed.

49
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:43,990
- With milk?
- Wait, what?

50
00:01:44,327 --> 00:01:46,544
Or half-proposed.

51
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:48,538
He was not not talking
about marriage.

52
00:01:48,615 --> 00:01:51,497
Is he competing with April?
I kind of get that.

53
00:01:51,583 --> 00:01:53,093
What did you say?

54
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:56,974
I said that, um,
I had to go get some milk.

55
00:01:57,064 --> 00:01:58,251
And what did he say?

56
00:01:58,328 --> 00:02:00,260
I don't know.
I left to get the milk.

57
00:02:00,337 --> 00:02:02,562
You know, he probably
doesn't really believe

58
00:02:02,639 --> 00:02:03,639
that you needed it.

59
00:02:03,716 --> 00:02:05,260
I had to get it, Meredith.

60
00:02:05,337 --> 00:02:07,640
Okay, well, why don't you
just tell Jackson

61
00:02:07,717 --> 00:02:09,058
that you're not ready?

62
00:02:09,135 --> 00:02:10,345
No.

63
00:02:11,087 --> 00:02:12,680
You are ready?
No!

64
00:02:12,757 --> 00:02:14,768
No, we haven't even said
"I love you" yet.

65
00:02:14,845 --> 00:02:16,779
It is too soon.
It...

66
00:02:17,047 --> 00:02:19,022
It's like you and Owen
playing house.

67
00:02:19,099 --> 00:02:21,888
Like insta-family,
like you just get a cup of soup,

68
00:02:21,965 --> 00:02:24,138
add some water,
and bam, family.

69
00:02:24,215 --> 00:02:25,786
At least until...

70
00:02:26,126 --> 00:02:27,495
Until what?

71
00:02:30,728 --> 00:02:32,263
We need toilet paper.

72
00:02:43,757 --> 00:02:45,985
Hey, I'm not entirely sure
why you left,

73
00:02:46,062 --> 00:02:47,109
but I'm back
at the hospital.

74
00:02:47,186 --> 00:02:49,268
My patient spiked
a post-op fever.

75
00:02:49,345 --> 00:02:50,964
So, call me back, okay?

76
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:52,110
Is she okay?

77
00:02:52,187 --> 00:02:54,018
Just lay back, Ms.
Colvin. Try to relax.

78
00:02:54,095 --> 00:02:55,198
She's been in and out
since you left,

79
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:56,142
and her blood pressure's
dropping.

80
00:02:56,219 --> 00:02:57,219
All right.
Let's get a sepsis work-up,

81
00:02:57,296 --> 00:02:58,626
a chest X-ray,
and some cultures.

82
00:02:58,703 --> 00:02:59,875
Blood and urine
is already done.

83
00:02:59,952 --> 00:03:02,339
Hey, Nisha, I'm gonna check out
your back, all right?

84
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:03,523
It might sting
a little bit.

85
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,472
Nisha, how you feeling?

86
00:03:05,549 --> 00:03:06,566
I don't know.

87
00:03:06,643 --> 00:03:07,902
How am I feeling?

88
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:09,398
You got a bit
of an infection back here,

89
00:03:09,475 --> 00:03:11,515
but I'm gonna change up
your antibiotics, okay?

90
00:03:11,592 --> 00:03:14,355
You can do
whatever you want to me.

91
00:03:14,432 --> 00:03:16,354
See?
I flirted!

92
00:03:16,431 --> 00:03:17,812
Excellent work.

93
00:03:17,889 --> 00:03:20,999
A little aggressive,
but once the drugs wear off,

94
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:23,154
we'll work on the nuance.

95
00:03:25,316 --> 00:03:27,085
She's in V-Tach!
Pull in the crash cart!

96
00:03:27,162 --> 00:03:28,414
What's happening?

97
00:03:28,491 --> 00:03:31,161
Paddles.
Sync charge to 100.

98
00:03:32,349 --> 00:03:33,362
All right, here we go.

99
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:34,896
We got you.

100
00:03:36,434 --> 00:03:37,549
Clear!

101
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,149
Still V-Tach.

102
00:03:39,226 --> 00:03:41,182
- Help her, please!
- 120.

103
00:03:41,366 --> 00:03:43,037
- Clear.
- Help her!

104
00:03:43,114 --> 00:03:44,608
- You have to do something!
- 200.

105
00:03:44,685 --> 00:03:45,882
Clear.

106
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:50,265
What... What happened?

107
00:03:50,342 --> 00:03:52,125
Dr. Avery,
her heart rate's climbing.

108
00:03:52,202 --> 00:03:53,555
Ah, it's gonna be
a long night.

109
00:03:53,632 --> 00:03:54,948
Here we go.

113
00:04:10,385 --> 00:04:12,704
<i>Victoria Fisher,

114
00:04:14,979 --> 00:04:16,510
Okay.

115
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:18,713
Whoa.

116
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:21,208
It's like a spa,
but on the moon.

117
00:04:21,289 --> 00:04:25,102
Just, uh, put on some
smooth jazz and some slippers,

118
00:04:25,179 --> 00:04:26,622
light some candles,
and, uh...

119
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:28,221
And you'd
blow yourself up.

120
00:04:28,298 --> 00:04:29,919
See, when these doors
are closed,

121
00:04:29,996 --> 00:04:33,093
it pressurizes the room
up to three atmospheres.

122
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:36,902
It will radically decrease
healing time.

123
00:04:36,979 --> 00:04:39,230
This is a world-class
hyperbaric chamber.

124
00:04:39,307 --> 00:04:40,732
Yeah, no, I know.

125
00:04:40,809 --> 00:04:42,703
But moon spa
sounds better.

126
00:04:43,353 --> 00:04:44,448
Oh, hey, uh,

127
00:04:44,525 --> 00:04:46,442
I've got some requisitions
that need approval.

128
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:47,734
Does that go
through you, or...

129
00:04:47,811 --> 00:04:49,070
You choose
an interim chief yet?

130
00:04:49,147 --> 00:04:50,211
Almost.

131
00:04:50,288 --> 00:04:53,772
Just going over
a few final considerations.

132
00:04:53,849 --> 00:04:55,473
Yeah,
it's a tough decision.

133
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:58,552
I mean, you want somebody good,
but not better than you, right?

134
00:04:58,629 --> 00:05:01,684
Like a solid substitute player,
maybe plays half the game.

135
00:05:01,761 --> 00:05:02,926
I'm sorry?

136
00:05:03,116 --> 00:05:05,386
You want a third-,
maybe fourth-round draft pack

137
00:05:05,463 --> 00:05:07,579
so your people really miss you
when you're gone.

138
00:05:07,656 --> 00:05:08,677
I mean, we all know
what happens

139
00:05:08,754 --> 00:05:09,937
when LeBron's on the bench,
right?

140
00:05:10,014 --> 00:05:13,075
The crowd goes wild...
"MVP, MVP, MV..."

141
00:05:13,576 --> 00:05:15,530
You're LeBron.
They want you back on the court

142
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:17,200
as soon as possible.

143
00:05:17,385 --> 00:05:18,931
Not into basketball?

144
00:05:19,008 --> 00:05:22,099
Okay, uh,
enjoy your moon spa.

145
00:05:27,004 --> 00:05:29,401
Hey.
You paged me to the breezeway.

146
00:05:29,478 --> 00:05:31,784
I wanted to see you, and...
Whoa.

147
00:05:34,315 --> 00:05:35,524
How was this morning?

148
00:05:35,601 --> 00:05:38,315
Uh, Leo slept in,
and Betty made breakfast.

149
00:05:38,392 --> 00:05:40,421
It was fine.
She was asking for you.

150
00:05:40,498 --> 00:05:42,094
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

151
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:47,071
We need help, please!

152
00:05:47,148 --> 00:05:49,110
- Are you hurt?
- They are! They're in the back!

153
00:05:49,187 --> 00:05:51,519
Who?
Our stupid parents.

154
00:05:53,151 --> 00:05:54,647
He was bleeding a lot.

155
00:05:54,724 --> 00:05:56,520
I used the whole roll
of paper towels.

156
00:05:56,597 --> 00:05:58,053
Uh, we need a gurney, now!

157
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:00,170
Two. My mom was also
on the motorcycle.

158
00:06:00,247 --> 00:06:02,083
Honey, did you put the van's
emergency brake on?

159
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,645
Yes, I'm not an idiot
like you and Dad

160
00:06:03,722 --> 00:06:05,034
who just crashed
a death machine!

161
00:06:05,111 --> 00:06:07,013
We were trying to avoid
hitting the dog!

162
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:09,021
And please don't yell at me.
I'm your mother.

163
00:06:09,098 --> 00:06:10,115
You're not acting
like it!

164
00:06:10,192 --> 00:06:12,534
- He wasn't wearing a helmet?
- Weonly had one. He made me wear it.

165
00:06:12,611 --> 00:06:14,213
We were just going
around the block!

166
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:15,894
Where's that gurney?

167
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:23,031

173
00:06:45,099 --> 00:06:47,736
Uh, exactly. I mean, she went

174
00:06:47,813 --> 00:06:49,039
in the middle of the night.

175
00:06:49,116 --> 00:06:51,780
And until the dialysis
restores her electrolytes,

176
00:06:51,857 --> 00:06:53,675
she's at risk
for arrhythmias.

177
00:06:53,752 --> 00:06:55,661
We could start her
on an amiodarone drip.

178
00:06:55,738 --> 00:06:57,338
All right, well let's keep that
as a plan

179
00:06:57,415 --> 00:06:59,476
and just keep rechecking
her potassium.

180
00:06:59,553 --> 00:07:00,549
And how's Nisha?

181
00:07:00,626 --> 00:07:02,610
She's septic,
white count of 22,000,

182
00:07:02,687 --> 00:07:04,381
and we started her
on pressors.

183
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:06,360
Her parents are on a flight back
from Tokyo now,

184
00:07:06,437 --> 00:07:10,516
but until they get here,
Cece won't leave her side.

185
00:07:10,676 --> 00:07:13,030
So, let's make sure that she
wears a mask and gloves.

186
00:07:13,107 --> 00:07:17,141
Yeah. Send for an ABG
and, uh, lactic acid.

187
00:07:17,739 --> 00:07:19,054
Thanks for keeping
an eye on her.

188
00:07:19,131 --> 00:07:20,318
She's a very sweet woman,

189
00:07:20,395 --> 00:07:21,780
but she's so aggressive
with the...

190
00:07:21,857 --> 00:07:22,855
- The matchmaking?
- Yes.

191
00:07:22,932 --> 00:07:23,941
- Right?
- Yeah, no kidding.

192
00:07:24,018 --> 00:07:25,775
She asked me about my status,
my relationship history,

193
00:07:25,852 --> 00:07:26,912
my 10-year plan.

194
00:07:26,989 --> 00:07:28,836
Career-
and relationship-wise.

195
00:07:28,997 --> 00:07:30,535
That's why I can't go back
in there.

196
00:07:30,612 --> 00:07:31,940
At least you can tell her
to back off

197
00:07:32,017 --> 00:07:33,057
because you have Maggie.

198
00:07:33,134 --> 00:07:35,096
Yeah, but you should just tell
her you have work, you know?

199
00:07:35,173 --> 00:07:36,272
And what does that mean?

200
00:07:36,349 --> 00:07:37,883
Like, that you're married
to your work.

201
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:38,965
I mean...

202
00:07:39,051 --> 00:07:40,060
But I'm not.

203
00:07:40,137 --> 00:07:43,094
Oh, come on. We all are.
Just you are especially.

204
00:07:43,227 --> 00:07:44,872
Excuse me?

205
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:47,951
Have you seen the, uh,
hyperbaric chamber?

206
00:07:48,028 --> 00:07:49,578
That thing is finished,
so it's probably worth

207
00:07:49,655 --> 00:07:51,351
taking a little peek.

208
00:07:53,808 --> 00:07:54,961
You're very successful.

209
00:07:55,038 --> 00:07:56,455
Oh, very.
Very successful.

210
00:07:56,532 --> 00:07:58,304
Yeah, but I'm not married...

211
00:07:58,456 --> 00:08:00,000
That's cool.

212
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:01,539
Me neither.

213
00:08:08,747 --> 00:08:09,816
Oh, hi.

214
00:08:09,893 --> 00:08:11,560
Um, may I remind you

215
00:08:11,637 --> 00:08:15,292
that many people still
call me "Chief" out of habit?

216
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:17,978
I mean, I can ensure
a seamless transition...

217
00:08:18,055 --> 00:08:19,810
It's not going to
be you.

218
00:08:19,887 --> 00:08:21,211
Wait, why on Earth not?

219
00:08:21,288 --> 00:08:22,856
Because...

220
00:08:23,098 --> 00:08:24,796
One day,
I want the job back,

221
00:08:24,873 --> 00:08:27,313
and... you're
a first-round draft pack,

222
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:29,432
and no one removes
a game starter from the court...

223
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,312
I mean office.

224
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:34,367
Since when
do you like sports?

225
00:08:38,278 --> 00:08:40,578
- Where are you going?
- To the moon spa.

226
00:08:41,207 --> 00:08:42,655
Where it's quiet.

227
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:48,164
Her creatinine
keeps climbing,

228
00:08:48,241 --> 00:08:51,649
so let's order an ultrasound
with contrast and a cardiac MRI.

229
00:08:51,726 --> 00:08:53,318
I just want to make sure
her tanking kidneys

230
00:08:53,395 --> 00:08:55,662
aren't tanking her heart.

231
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:57,915
I, uh...

232
00:08:57,992 --> 00:09:00,096
I understand why you don't want
to go in there.

233
00:09:00,189 --> 00:09:02,624
I mean, I'm married
to general surgery, too.

234
00:09:02,701 --> 00:09:04,464
I get it.
I relate.

235
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:05,782
Helm, no.

236
00:09:05,859 --> 00:09:08,531
I... It's... Just...
Go get the MRI, please.

237
00:09:08,608 --> 00:09:10,154
Oh, Meredith!
There she is.

238
00:09:10,231 --> 00:09:11,227
Can we talk?

239
00:09:11,304 --> 00:09:12,333
What happened
to the honeymoon?

240
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:13,398
What happened
to your face?

241
00:09:13,475 --> 00:09:14,521
I forgot sunscreen.

242
00:09:14,598 --> 00:09:16,223
And I want to
save the world.

243
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,029
Oh.
Come on.

244
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:23,444
What do you think?

245
00:09:25,824 --> 00:09:27,759
I think...

246
00:09:27,946 --> 00:09:29,324
Alex married up.

247
00:09:29,401 --> 00:09:31,502
Right? If she does this,
I can retire

248
00:09:31,579 --> 00:09:33,081
and buy a bigger boat
than Avery.

249
00:09:33,158 --> 00:09:35,036
And also save lives.

250
00:09:35,113 --> 00:09:37,044
And this would work
for all types of cancers?

251
00:09:37,121 --> 00:09:39,826
Leukemias, adenocarcinomas,
liver hepatomas?

252
00:09:39,903 --> 00:09:40,992
Maybe? I don't know!

253
00:09:41,069 --> 00:09:43,076
But if we can isolate
the cancer cells

254
00:09:43,153 --> 00:09:44,456
and locate the gene sequence

255
00:09:44,533 --> 00:09:46,124
that makes them grow
uncontrollably,

256
00:09:46,201 --> 00:09:48,036
then, theoretically,

257
00:09:48,113 --> 00:09:50,916
we can make the anti-DNA
sequence that'll stop it.

258
00:09:50,993 --> 00:09:52,464
Well, then you could use it
for anything

259
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:53,794
that goes wrong in the body.

260
00:09:53,871 --> 00:09:55,487
- Exactly.
- Well, now I'm pissed

261
00:09:55,564 --> 00:09:57,460
because you came back early
from your honeymoon

262
00:09:57,537 --> 00:09:59,334
to wave the future of medicine
in my face

263
00:09:59,411 --> 00:10:00,890
and take it to Boston?

264
00:10:01,028 --> 00:10:04,245
I came back to ask you to create
a fellowship for me.

265
00:10:04,322 --> 00:10:06,726
So that I can keep working
on mini livers and this.

266
00:10:06,803 --> 00:10:08,336
Mostly this.

267
00:10:08,629 --> 00:10:09,972
With you.

268
00:10:10,149 --> 00:10:12,531
Give me an hour to get approval
from Bailey.

269
00:10:18,323 --> 00:10:19,526
So, you were lucky.

270
00:10:19,603 --> 00:10:21,025
You may have gotten away
with a few bruises

271
00:10:21,102 --> 00:10:22,890
- and cuts on your hands.
- I'm so sorry.

272
00:10:22,967 --> 00:10:24,695
Don't apologize.
This is my job.

273
00:10:24,772 --> 00:10:26,190
No, I'm so embarrassed.

274
00:10:26,267 --> 00:10:28,815
We decided to take a ride,
just around the block.

275
00:10:28,892 --> 00:10:30,584
Doug bought the bike
a few weeks ago.

276
00:10:30,661 --> 00:10:32,018
He works in HR,
and frankly,

277
00:10:32,095 --> 00:10:34,694
I think he might be having some
sort of mild mid-life crisis.

278
00:10:34,771 --> 00:10:36,276
But he had a motorcycle
in college,

279
00:10:36,353 --> 00:10:38,140
and it made him happy,
and I want to support him,

280
00:10:38,217 --> 00:10:39,229
but I don't like it.

281
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:41,718
But then I saw him in the garage
in a greasy T-shirt,

282
00:10:41,795 --> 00:10:45,117
and he looked good.
Like, 1993 good.

283
00:10:45,218 --> 00:10:46,792
Mom. You okay?

284
00:10:46,869 --> 00:10:48,164
Sweetie,
where's the dog?

285
00:10:48,241 --> 00:10:49,656
He got away.

286
00:10:50,174 --> 00:10:51,300
Wait, in here?

287
00:10:51,377 --> 00:10:53,084
You brought the dog
in the hospital?

288
00:10:53,161 --> 00:10:54,275
I'm so sorry.

289
00:10:54,352 --> 00:10:55,331
Again.

290
00:10:55,408 --> 00:10:57,875
Uh, I'll check
on your husband, okay?

291
00:10:58,656 --> 00:11:01,495
- Qadri, go find the dog.
- Uh...

292
00:11:01,572 --> 00:11:03,023
Qadri.
I was third in my class.

293
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,104
Hey.

294
00:11:04,181 --> 00:11:05,465
Dad has a nasty scalp lac,

295
00:11:05,542 --> 00:11:07,374
and I felt a step-off
on the right temporal area,

296
00:11:07,451 --> 00:11:09,398
so we've got to rule out
a skull fracture.

297
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:14,492
I thought military people
prided themselves on their punctuality.

298
00:11:14,569 --> 00:11:15,753
I paged you
20 minutes ago.

299
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:17,752
I was in the E.R.
and you paged me to a stairwell

300
00:11:17,829 --> 00:11:19,291
- and then you weren't there.
- Well,

301
00:11:19,368 --> 00:11:21,492
I had to walk.
I was stressed.

302
00:11:21,906 --> 00:11:23,750
And attendings
are never wrong.

303
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:26,665
You're stressing
about the thing we both know

304
00:11:26,742 --> 00:11:28,395
and can't talk about,
right?

305
00:11:28,472 --> 00:11:30,964
I know. I'm working with
Dr. Shepherd and Major Hunt today,

306
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:33,203
and I feel like I'm lying
to my commanding officer.

307
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:35,878
I hate secrets.
I've always hated keeping them.

308
00:11:35,955 --> 00:11:38,633
They start out as these tiny
seeds of information,

309
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:42,711
and then they grow into these
terrifying Venus flytraps

310
00:11:42,788 --> 00:11:45,916
that will eat your relationships
alive, one by one.

311
00:11:45,993 --> 00:11:47,204
We have to do something.

312
00:11:47,281 --> 00:11:48,892
We?
Yes.

313
00:11:49,164 --> 00:11:50,226
Amelia's happy.

314
00:11:50,303 --> 00:11:52,683
She's like "Leave It To Beaver,"
co-parenting happy.

315
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:56,868
She and Owen are completely
oblivious about the love child

316
00:11:56,945 --> 00:12:00,067
that is just going to drop
on them like a bomb!

317
00:12:00,504 --> 00:12:02,654
Babies are not bombs.
I'm very sorry.

318
00:12:02,731 --> 00:12:04,101
I don't know what's wrong
with me.

319
00:12:04,178 --> 00:12:05,426
I used to have it together.

320
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:07,317
I used to be sane,
but then HIPAA

321
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:10,176
and half-marriage proposals
and not enough sleep.

322
00:12:10,253 --> 00:12:11,563
Dr. Avery proposed?

323
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,838
Go away.
We're not friends.

324
00:12:12,915 --> 00:12:14,724
- Well, you paged me.
- Go. Go!

325
00:12:15,869 --> 00:12:16,947
Hey.
Hey.

326
00:12:17,033 --> 00:12:18,078
- You okay?
- Yes.

327
00:12:18,155 --> 00:12:20,374
I'm really sorry I didn't come
back with the milk last night.

328
00:12:20,451 --> 00:12:22,317
I... I drove to the store,
and then I...

329
00:12:22,394 --> 00:12:26,300
I drove to the wrong house,
and I got tired, so I just...

330
00:12:26,377 --> 00:12:28,184
I stayed there.
But I did buy the milk.

331
00:12:28,261 --> 00:12:29,603
Dr. Avery?

332
00:12:29,858 --> 00:12:31,435
Nisha's cultures are back.

333
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:33,103
Uh...

334
00:12:33,236 --> 00:12:34,318
Uh, can I...
Can we talk later?

335
00:12:34,395 --> 00:12:35,557
Mm-hmm.

336
00:12:38,955 --> 00:12:42,193
We need to isolate her
and get her into O.R., stat.

337
00:12:42,439 --> 00:12:44,164
Cece, I need you on the other
side of that glass

338
00:12:44,241 --> 00:12:46,101
- right now, please.
- Her parents aren't here yet

339
00:12:46,178 --> 00:12:48,871
- I don't want to leave her alone.
- Right now. Please. Thank you.

340
00:12:48,985 --> 00:12:51,116
Nisha, you've got
an infection, okay?

341
00:12:51,193 --> 00:12:52,479
It's called
necrotizing fasciitis.

342
00:12:52,556 --> 00:12:53,833
It's very serious.
We're gonna get you

343
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:55,738
straight
into the O.R., okay?

344
00:12:55,815 --> 00:12:58,568
Tell my mom I love her.

345
00:12:58,645 --> 00:13:00,488
Tell her thank you.

346
00:13:00,565 --> 00:13:01,609
Tell her...

347
00:13:01,686 --> 00:13:03,333
You're just
getting started, Nisha.

348
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:04,682
Do you hear me?

349
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:07,060
You are just
getting started.

350
00:13:07,609 --> 00:13:09,843
Schmitt, wait.
We're not taking her to the O.R.

351
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,255
Let me get her
to the basement.

352
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:13,505
- What's in the basement?
- I got to find Bailey.

353
00:13:17,855 --> 00:13:19,964
You better be here
to wonder and marvel

354
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:21,424
at the future
of medicine.

355
00:13:21,501 --> 00:13:24,255
That's exactly
what I'm doing.

356
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:28,290
Jo Wilson came up with
an insanely brilliant idea

357
00:13:28,367 --> 00:13:30,551
that will change the way
we do our jobs.

358
00:13:30,689 --> 00:13:32,952
And I would like
to offer her

359
00:13:33,029 --> 00:13:35,409
a surgical innovation
fellowship.

360
00:13:35,493 --> 00:13:37,333
That is a thing
that doesn't exist.

361
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:39,466
Exactly. That's why
we should invent it...

362
00:13:39,543 --> 00:13:41,466
So we can wonder
and marvel some more.

363
00:13:41,543 --> 00:13:45,116
I just spent a lot
of money to make money, Grey.

364
00:13:45,193 --> 00:13:48,018
I need to let it make some money
before I spend any more.

365
00:13:48,095 --> 00:13:49,303
We'd get to keep Alex.

366
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:52,595
The only way I could afford
a new fellowship for Jo Wilson

367
00:13:52,672 --> 00:13:56,517
is with the salary I'd free up
by losing Alex Karev.

368
00:13:56,594 --> 00:14:00,400
But I have to replace Karev,
so there is no money.

369
00:14:00,953 --> 00:14:02,645
My patient has
necrotizing fasciitis.

370
00:14:02,722 --> 00:14:03,882
I need
the hyperbaric chamber.

371
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:04,876
I think
it's her only shot.

372
00:14:04,953 --> 00:14:05,985
You want to debride her
in here?

373
00:14:06,062 --> 00:14:06,911
How would you
do that?

374
00:14:06,988 --> 00:14:08,429
You can't use
any electricity in here.

375
00:14:08,506 --> 00:14:09,962
- No cautery, no...
- It's okay, I'll go old school.

376
00:14:10,039 --> 00:14:11,751
I'll just use a scalpel.
No, you sit in here.

377
00:14:11,828 --> 00:14:13,265
You don't operate in here.

378
00:14:13,342 --> 00:14:14,496
Think of it like a spa.

379
00:14:14,573 --> 00:14:16,220
Debriding in high-flow oxygen
has shown

380
00:14:16,297 --> 00:14:18,315
to improve survival outcomes
in crush injuries

381
00:14:18,392 --> 00:14:19,259
with wound infections.

382
00:14:19,336 --> 00:14:21,514
Debriding with a scalpel
would take hours.

383
00:14:21,591 --> 00:14:24,822
You'd be putting your staff
at risk for decompression illness,

384
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:26,216
a-and you'd be stuck
in here.

385
00:14:26,293 --> 00:14:28,294
You couldn't leave until
it was depressurized.

386
00:14:28,371 --> 00:14:29,791
Okay, this thing
is useless.

387
00:14:29,868 --> 00:14:31,462
I say we sell it
and keep Jo Wilson.

388
00:14:31,539 --> 00:14:33,314
Grey, the answer is no.
Avery...

389
00:14:33,391 --> 00:14:35,441
If DeLuca hadn't pulled me out
of the way of that van,

390
00:14:35,518 --> 00:14:36,938
then that woman
might be fine.

391
00:14:37,015 --> 00:14:38,790
All right? She might have
been the one that called 911

392
00:14:38,867 --> 00:14:40,456
and put me in the ambulance
for all that I know,

393
00:14:40,533 --> 00:14:41,794
and I'm here, I'm okay.

394
00:14:41,871 --> 00:14:43,446
I'm standing
in a medical spaceship

395
00:14:43,523 --> 00:14:45,112
that you built
for us to save lives,

396
00:14:45,189 --> 00:14:47,790
and the only one standing in the
way of me saving hers is you.

397
00:14:48,547 --> 00:14:49,834
Please.

398
00:14:55,014 --> 00:14:56,020
So?

399
00:14:56,097 --> 00:14:57,907
She built a submarine
in the basement,

400
00:14:57,984 --> 00:14:59,493
and apparently
there's no money now.

401
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:00,686
So, what do we do now?

402
00:15:00,763 --> 00:15:03,135
I don't know. Wait for
more funds to become available?

403
00:15:03,212 --> 00:15:04,872
I'd say for now,
just go to Boston.

404
00:15:04,949 --> 00:15:05,985
As much as I hate it.

405
00:15:06,062 --> 00:15:07,057
We can't.

406
00:15:07,134 --> 00:15:08,075
It's only a year.

407
00:15:08,152 --> 00:15:10,055
We go, you learn
more cool stuff, we come home.

408
00:15:10,132 --> 00:15:12,915
We can't because I already
called them and told them no.

409
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:14,985
I don't have a job.

410
00:15:15,062 --> 00:15:16,563
Anywhere.

411
00:15:20,897 --> 00:15:23,645
All right, once this
door closes, you're in.

412
00:15:23,722 --> 00:15:27,438
If we depressurize too quick,
you will get nitrogen toxicity.

413
00:15:27,515 --> 00:15:30,025
You're also looking
at eardrum rupture,

414
00:15:30,102 --> 00:15:34,645
lung collapse, sinus damage,
changes in vision, uh...

415
00:15:34,722 --> 00:15:36,783
Don't forget to pop your ears!

416
00:15:49,942 --> 00:15:52,283
Megan Salinas
to Oncology.

417
00:15:52,889 --> 00:15:54,512
Doug's CT shows
a skull fracture

418
00:15:54,589 --> 00:15:55,864
with a small bleed
underneath it.

419
00:15:55,941 --> 00:15:57,433
I gonna need to take him
to the O.R.

420
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:59,542
and drain it
and relieve the pressure.

421
00:15:59,619 --> 00:16:01,601
He needs brain surgery?

422
00:16:01,678 --> 00:16:03,038
Actual brain surgery?

423
00:16:03,115 --> 00:16:04,628
Honestly, it could've been
a lot worse.

424
00:16:04,705 --> 00:16:06,519
Motorcycle accidents
without helmets...

425
00:16:06,596 --> 00:16:09,073
Honey, maybe you should take
Hank to the cafeteria.

426
00:16:09,162 --> 00:16:10,480
I want to stay
with you.

427
00:16:10,557 --> 00:16:11,642
Are you crazy?!

428
00:16:11,719 --> 00:16:13,048
I'm not leaving you two
alone again.

429
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:15,335
Wynnie, I am so sorry,
but we'll be okay.

430
00:16:15,412 --> 00:16:16,972
No, I had to drive you
to the hospital,

431
00:16:17,049 --> 00:16:18,593
and I don't even
have a license!

432
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:19,902
She has
her learner's permit.

433
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,593
No, I'm a terrible driver.

434
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:23,556
We could have all
been dead today.

435
00:16:24,545 --> 00:16:25,631
Dad!

436
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:28,123
Hey, guys.

437
00:16:28,334 --> 00:16:30,102
Don't worry. I'm fine.

438
00:16:30,179 --> 00:16:32,437
He's got a little bruise
on the inside of his head,

439
00:16:32,514 --> 00:16:34,027
but I'm gonna fix it
right up, okay?

440
00:16:34,104 --> 00:16:35,670
Mm-hmm.

441
00:16:37,049 --> 00:16:38,546
Well, surgery
shouldn't be too long,

442
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:40,120
so I can show you
where you can wait, okay?

443
00:16:40,197 --> 00:16:41,333
I got him!

444
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:44,548
He may have eaten someone's
Jell-O, but I think he's okay.

445
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:45,608
Here's your dog.

446
00:16:45,685 --> 00:16:46,738
Oh, no,
he's not our dog.

447
00:16:46,815 --> 00:16:48,524
He's a stray we almost hit.

448
00:16:48,601 --> 00:16:49,777
Can we keep him?

449
00:16:49,854 --> 00:16:50,878
I'm allergic.

450
00:16:50,955 --> 00:16:52,709
So lame.

451
00:16:53,078 --> 00:16:55,495
No, don't just
let him go...

452
00:16:55,572 --> 00:16:56,982
Qadri.

453
00:16:59,381 --> 00:17:00,962
Third in my class!

454
00:17:01,534 --> 00:17:03,472
She's still hyperkalemic,

455
00:17:03,549 --> 00:17:06,306
even with the dialysis
and the insulin drip.

456
00:17:06,383 --> 00:17:08,858
Is she on her way
up to the MRI?

457
00:17:08,935 --> 00:17:11,983
Yes, uh, radiology should be
sending the results any minute,

458
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:14,288
and I asked Dr. Pierce
to meet you in the tech room

459
00:17:14,365 --> 00:17:15,394
so she could have
a look.

460
00:17:15,471 --> 00:17:16,939
Great work, Helm.

461
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:18,287
Thank you.

462
00:17:19,685 --> 00:17:21,595
Why are you looking at me
like that?

463
00:17:21,896 --> 00:17:23,462
Nothing.
I'm not.

464
00:17:23,549 --> 00:17:25,392
- Hey. You needed me?
- Yep.

465
00:17:25,469 --> 00:17:27,079
<i>Shea Drexler
to Pathology.</i>

466
00:17:27,156 --> 00:17:28,343
Shea Drexler...

467
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:29,577
What do you got?

468
00:17:29,654 --> 00:17:31,173
Motorcycle injury.

469
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,316
No helmet.

470
00:17:32,393 --> 00:17:33,457
Stupid.

471
00:17:33,543 --> 00:17:34,553
Yep.

472
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:35,682
You?

473
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:37,684
Matchmaker
with a bad heart.

474
00:17:37,761 --> 00:17:39,161
- Ironic.
- She's a matchmaker?

475
00:17:39,238 --> 00:17:41,851
- Those still exist?
- I guess Internet dating is just so...

476
00:17:41,928 --> 00:17:43,196
- Deceitful?
- Depressing.

477
00:17:43,273 --> 00:17:44,488
Exactly.

478
00:17:44,839 --> 00:17:46,283
Is there a dog in here?

479
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,423
- What?
- What?

480
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,093
No. Nothing.

481
00:17:50,394 --> 00:17:54,223
I had an 89-year-old patient
in L.A. who hired a matchmaker

482
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,694
to help her find a man
who could drive at night.

483
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:58,366
That was
her only requirement.

484
00:17:58,443 --> 00:17:59,458
That's so sweet.

485
00:17:59,535 --> 00:18:00,689
Well, they take
the work out for you.

486
00:18:00,766 --> 00:18:02,770
They weed out the creeps
and the emotional baggage.

487
00:18:02,847 --> 00:18:04,997
They get you
to that pre-vetted place.

488
00:18:05,074 --> 00:18:06,528
Like where Owen and I are.

489
00:18:06,605 --> 00:18:08,558
Which is where, exactly?

490
00:18:08,635 --> 00:18:10,342
Where he's gonna drive her
around at night?

491
00:18:10,419 --> 00:18:11,640
I think so.

492
00:18:11,717 --> 00:18:12,918
I hope so.

493
00:18:12,995 --> 00:18:14,152
I don't.

494
00:18:14,369 --> 00:18:16,405
I don't hope that for you.

495
00:18:16,482 --> 00:18:17,463
What?

496
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:18,714
Why not?

497
00:18:18,832 --> 00:18:19,987
I just...
You know what?

498
00:18:20,064 --> 00:18:21,485
Don't answer that
until you have dealt

499
00:18:21,562 --> 00:18:22,974
with your own half-proposal.

500
00:18:23,051 --> 00:18:24,727
Jackson told me
I'm married to my work.

501
00:18:24,804 --> 00:18:25,842
Am I married to my work?

502
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,382
Oh, he just throws that word
around a lot, doesn't he?

503
00:18:28,459 --> 00:18:31,054
Oh, they sent
the studies.

504
00:18:33,008 --> 00:18:34,971
I may be a little rusty
with hearts,

505
00:18:35,048 --> 00:18:36,243
but that looks like...

506
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,937
It's barely pumping.

507
00:18:38,136 --> 00:18:40,898
The scar tissue's restricted
her entire heart.

508
00:18:45,695 --> 00:18:46,899
Schmitt,
if you stand there,

509
00:18:46,976 --> 00:18:48,306
my elbow's gonna be
in your face for hours.

510
00:18:48,383 --> 00:18:49,458
I need you to move.

511
00:18:49,535 --> 00:18:51,234
How many hours
are we thinking?

512
00:18:51,526 --> 00:18:54,444
I... I should have mentioned,
I'm a tad claustrophobic.

513
00:18:54,531 --> 00:18:56,500
You're... You're standing
on her suction.

514
00:18:56,708 --> 00:18:58,153
Schmitt!

515
00:18:59,011 --> 00:19:00,312
I didn't sign off
on this!

516
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:02,203
I did.
I signed.

517
00:19:02,321 --> 00:19:03,324
Well, she's my patient, too.

518
00:19:03,401 --> 00:19:05,007
Open up the... oor...
I want in.

519
00:19:05,084 --> 00:19:07,620
I... sor... I... y... e...

520
00:19:07,697 --> 00:19:10,374
And why doesn't that work for
all the money I paid for that?

521
00:19:10,451 --> 00:19:11,474
Let me in.

522
00:19:11,551 --> 00:19:13,270
I can't.
It's already pressurized.

523
00:19:13,347 --> 00:19:14,765
They're in. You're out.

524
00:19:18,919 --> 00:19:20,137
Oh, God.

525
00:19:20,222 --> 00:19:22,901
I'm feeling like I, uh...
I can't breathe.

526
00:19:22,978 --> 00:19:24,590
A-A-Anyone else
feel that?

527
00:19:24,754 --> 00:19:26,176
Like there's
not enough air?

528
00:19:26,253 --> 00:19:27,902
We're in compressed air.

529
00:19:27,979 --> 00:19:30,231
It's literally the whole point
of this thing, all right?

530
00:19:30,308 --> 00:19:32,890
So just grab a scalpel.
Take a breath.

531
00:19:36,355 --> 00:19:41,490
<i>♪ Won't you tell him,
please, put on some speed ♪</i>

532
00:19:41,567 --> 00:19:44,008
<i>♪ Follow my lead ♪</i>

533
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:45,734
How's Nisha?

534
00:19:45,811 --> 00:19:47,326
She's still in
with Dr. Avery.

535
00:19:47,403 --> 00:19:49,070
Cece, we need to talk
about your heart.

536
00:19:49,147 --> 00:19:51,933
Tell me I didn't kill
that girl, Dr. Grey. Please.

537
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:53,961
Go get me an update
on Nisha, please.

538
00:19:55,169 --> 00:19:57,193
Get me a crash cart.

539
00:20:01,518 --> 00:20:02,874
Let's page Dr. Pierce.

540
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:04,797
Charge to 100.

541
00:20:06,135 --> 00:20:07,809
Clear.

542
00:20:10,801 --> 00:20:14,252
DeLuca, I need a quick statement
about the O.R. fire yesterday.

543
00:20:14,329 --> 00:20:16,464
How are you feeling?
Any pain?

544
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:18,462
You know what, Dr. Webber?
I'm not feeling any pain

545
00:20:18,539 --> 00:20:20,015
for the first time
in a long time.

546
00:20:20,092 --> 00:20:22,084
That fire...
It's like it woke me up.

547
00:20:22,161 --> 00:20:23,939
I mean, that
and the car crash, obviously.

548
00:20:24,016 --> 00:20:25,847
But saving lives?

549
00:20:25,924 --> 00:20:27,468
I mean, yeah, maybe it was
the adrenaline rush,

550
00:20:27,545 --> 00:20:29,511
but I needed it.
I needed all of it.

551
00:20:29,588 --> 00:20:30,651
You know, I feel better.

552
00:20:30,728 --> 00:20:32,780
I feel awake.
I feel grateful.

553
00:20:32,857 --> 00:20:34,339
I feel awake and alive.

554
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:36,677
DeLuca, I just need to know
if you were injured in any way

555
00:20:36,754 --> 00:20:38,086
- by the fire.
- Oh, yeah, no, I'm good.

556
00:20:38,163 --> 00:20:39,639
Okay, thank you.

557
00:20:40,821 --> 00:20:42,223
Stop! Oh!

558
00:20:44,132 --> 00:20:45,776
First, I was worried
about my heart,

559
00:20:45,853 --> 00:20:46,857
but it was my kidneys.

560
00:20:46,934 --> 00:20:48,311
Now that I'm worried
about my kidneys,

561
00:20:48,388 --> 00:20:49,640
you're worried
about my heart.

562
00:20:49,717 --> 00:20:52,577
Cece, I'd like to do a heart
biopsy on you, which is...

563
00:20:52,654 --> 00:20:56,011
I've had three hearts,
Dr. Pierce.

564
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:58,445
I could probably
do a biopsy on myself, so...

565
00:20:58,522 --> 00:20:59,542
Right.

566
00:20:59,619 --> 00:21:01,373
Okay, so you know that I'll
have a better idea

567
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:03,304
once I can actually get in there
and see the muscle.

568
00:21:03,381 --> 00:21:05,745
Okay, so let's change
her dialysis bag,

569
00:21:05,822 --> 00:21:08,546
start her on a lasix drip,
then get her upstairs.

570
00:21:08,623 --> 00:21:09,659
On it.

571
00:21:09,736 --> 00:21:11,898
Whatever you need,
Dr. Grey.

572
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:23,374
I spent 35 years of my life
falling for straight women.

573
00:21:24,906 --> 00:21:26,814
I don't know
what you mean.

574
00:21:26,941 --> 00:21:29,392
Hook me up to that thing
and sit down.

575
00:21:29,469 --> 00:21:33,687
Let me save you
from a whole life of misery.

576
00:21:35,998 --> 00:21:38,022
<i>Dr. Zellman
to Labor and Delivery.</i>

577
00:21:38,099 --> 00:21:40,530
<i>Dr. Zellman
to Labor and Delivery.</i>

578
00:21:42,994 --> 00:21:44,175
Hey.

579
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,397
Hey.
How is she?

580
00:21:46,669 --> 00:21:48,757
It's hard to say.

581
00:21:49,606 --> 00:21:51,156
Stop!

582
00:21:51,233 --> 00:21:54,718
Stop!
Oh, stop...

583
00:21:55,203 --> 00:21:57,280
I'm Link, by the way.

584
00:21:57,996 --> 00:21:59,752
- What?
- We haven't officially met.

585
00:21:59,829 --> 00:22:02,866
Although you were kind enough to
let me know your marital status,

586
00:22:02,943 --> 00:22:04,335
which I appreciated.

587
00:22:04,412 --> 00:22:05,586
No games.

588
00:22:05,663 --> 00:22:06,836
I should clear that up.

589
00:22:06,913 --> 00:22:08,853
I was saying that
I wasn't married to my work.

590
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:10,277
Oh, yeah.

591
00:22:10,442 --> 00:22:12,638
No, that was not clear
at all.

592
00:22:12,715 --> 00:22:15,709
Dr. Avery was saying that
I'm married to my work,

593
00:22:15,786 --> 00:22:17,332
and I was saying
that I wasn't.

594
00:22:17,409 --> 00:22:19,382
Ah, got it.
Yeah, so you are married.

595
00:22:19,459 --> 00:22:21,295
No, I'm not,
but that's not the point.

596
00:22:21,372 --> 00:22:23,919
The point is
I have a life after work.

597
00:22:23,996 --> 00:22:25,108
All right, that's cool.

598
00:22:25,185 --> 00:22:26,717
- You mean like tonight?
- What?

599
00:22:26,794 --> 00:22:28,716
I mean, I got to see
how this patient comes out,

600
00:22:28,793 --> 00:22:31,117
but, uh, we could do
a late drink?

601
00:22:31,194 --> 00:22:34,374
Oh, no, I have a surgery
I have to...

602
00:22:35,516 --> 00:22:37,140
Your first name's
Atticus?

603
00:22:37,251 --> 00:22:38,921
Oh.
Uh, eh.

604
00:22:38,998 --> 00:22:41,194
Really mostly in writing.

605
00:22:41,492 --> 00:22:43,535
Your name
is Atticus Lincoln?

606
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:45,663
And you call yourself Link?

607
00:22:45,762 --> 00:22:47,300
Yep.

608
00:22:48,522 --> 00:22:50,074
Hmm.

609
00:22:50,923 --> 00:22:52,709
Wait, so your parents
named you

610
00:22:52,786 --> 00:22:56,172
after two of the greatest
figures of our time,

611
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:58,507
both literary
and historical,

612
00:22:58,713 --> 00:23:01,624
and you call yourself Link?

613
00:23:03,076 --> 00:23:04,300
Okay.

614
00:23:04,492 --> 00:23:06,054
It's shorter.

615
00:23:07,823 --> 00:23:09,323
- Hey.
- Hey.

616
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,830
So, I'll elevate the fracture
and evacuate the hematoma.

617
00:23:11,907 --> 00:23:14,163
It looks like it's gonna be
fairly simple.

618
00:23:14,832 --> 00:23:17,442
Are we on a motorcycle
with only one helmet?

619
00:23:18,675 --> 00:23:20,528
What?
It's just...

620
00:23:20,814 --> 00:23:24,317
Last time we did this,
did us...

621
00:23:24,702 --> 00:23:27,176
there were no strings.
It was uncomplicated.

622
00:23:27,324 --> 00:23:29,288
And now there are strings.

623
00:23:29,365 --> 00:23:30,519
And you don't want strings.

624
00:23:30,596 --> 00:23:32,002
No, no, no,
it's not that.

625
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:33,614
It's just...

626
00:23:33,889 --> 00:23:36,286
Leo and Betty are stable,
they're doing great,

627
00:23:36,363 --> 00:23:38,366
and I just want to make sure
that you and I...

628
00:23:38,443 --> 00:23:39,809
We're not being...

629
00:23:40,027 --> 00:23:42,044
- Reckless.
- Right.

630
00:23:43,866 --> 00:23:45,670
Let's talk after, okay?

631
00:23:45,747 --> 00:23:47,278
Yeah.

632
00:23:54,022 --> 00:23:56,005
All right.
How are we?

633
00:23:56,204 --> 00:23:57,462
Better.

634
00:23:57,983 --> 00:24:00,177
Ears a little
stopped up, but...

635
00:24:00,254 --> 00:24:02,129
Our patient.
How's our patient?

636
00:24:02,206 --> 00:24:03,250
Oh...

637
00:24:03,327 --> 00:24:05,903
Pressure's up.
Heart rate's stable.

638
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:07,340
Steady sats.

639
00:24:07,419 --> 00:24:11,363
And finally got ourselves
some viable tissue.

640
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,794
Blood has never looked
so good.

641
00:24:14,791 --> 00:24:16,056
Whoo!

642
00:24:17,504 --> 00:24:19,788
And the peanut gallery's
happy, too.

643
00:24:19,865 --> 00:24:21,106
I can't believe
it worked.

644
00:24:21,183 --> 00:24:22,647
Such a crazy idea.

645
00:24:22,724 --> 00:24:24,078
But brilliant.

646
00:24:24,155 --> 00:24:26,490
Well, we got to
try our best, right?

647
00:24:26,567 --> 00:24:28,262
I mean,
life's too short not to.

648
00:24:28,339 --> 00:24:30,887
Right,
'cause you almost died.

649
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,614
Is... Is that why
you proposed, too?

650
00:24:33,691 --> 00:24:34,773
What?

651
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:37,903
'Cause life is short,
so you proposed.

652
00:24:38,246 --> 00:24:40,239
Seems a little sudden,
but...

653
00:24:40,316 --> 00:24:42,020
Just stop talking.
Irrigate the field.

654
00:24:42,097 --> 00:24:43,470
Right.

655
00:24:43,645 --> 00:24:45,802
I didn't...
I didn't propose.

656
00:24:45,987 --> 00:24:47,182
I will shut up.

657
00:24:47,259 --> 00:24:48,483
Just irrigate the field.

658
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,294
She thinks I proposed?

659
00:24:50,435 --> 00:24:51,649
Uh...

660
00:24:59,688 --> 00:25:01,535
I screwed everything up.

661
00:25:01,612 --> 00:25:05,724
I made you quit your job here
because I had a job not here,

662
00:25:05,801 --> 00:25:07,613
I abandoned you
on our honeymoon,

663
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:10,448
and n-now you are married
to a day drinker, so...

664
00:25:10,525 --> 00:25:13,971
Look, you can call Mass General,
ask them to reconsider,

665
00:25:14,048 --> 00:25:16,857
and, you know, just say that it was
some kind of misunderstanding.

666
00:25:16,934 --> 00:25:18,582
I don't want it.

667
00:25:20,308 --> 00:25:23,601
I think I applied for
a fellowship in Boston

668
00:25:23,678 --> 00:25:26,160
because I could apply
for a fellowship in Boston

669
00:25:26,237 --> 00:25:27,546
because Paul's dead.

670
00:25:27,623 --> 00:25:29,415
But I didn't stop
to consider

671
00:25:29,492 --> 00:25:32,840
what I actually want,
which is not Boston.

672
00:25:33,099 --> 00:25:35,535
I hate Boston.

673
00:25:35,641 --> 00:25:38,042
Boston feels like I'm moving
backwards with my life.

674
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:40,269
I want to move forward.

675
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,832
You know what?

676
00:25:44,319 --> 00:25:45,646
I'm gonna talk to Bailey.

677
00:25:45,723 --> 00:25:47,449
Bailey said
there's no money.

678
00:25:47,548 --> 00:25:49,611
There is always money.

679
00:25:49,688 --> 00:25:50,894
You just have to make 'em...

680
00:25:50,971 --> 00:25:52,368
want to spend it.

681
00:25:57,145 --> 00:25:59,413
All right.
We're almost done here.

682
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:00,671
Sorry.

683
00:26:00,748 --> 00:26:03,081
Why are her vitals dropping?
We already debrided the source.

684
00:26:03,158 --> 00:26:05,408
I don't know. She's still
hypotensive, tachycardic.

685
00:26:05,485 --> 00:26:07,504
Switching to
manual ventilation.

686
00:26:08,013 --> 00:26:10,128
What is it?
Why is she taking a dive?

687
00:26:10,205 --> 00:26:12,746
Avery, what's happened?

688
00:26:12,934 --> 00:26:15,066
Check under the drapes!

689
00:26:18,389 --> 00:26:21,097
She's crashing.
Max out her pressors. Come on.

690
00:26:24,371 --> 00:26:25,899
Check under the drapes.

691
00:26:25,988 --> 00:26:27,089
W-What is he
pointing at?

692
00:26:27,166 --> 00:26:29,191
The drapes? The drapes?
Yeah, she's sterile.

693
00:26:29,319 --> 00:26:33,371
Ex-fix!
Look at the ex-fix!

694
00:26:34,273 --> 00:26:35,464
Infection spread
to the ex-fix.

695
00:26:35,541 --> 00:26:37,160
I need ortho to remove
this hardware now.

696
00:26:37,237 --> 00:26:38,403
Get in here.
I can't get in!

697
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,511
He can't come in until we
depressurize the room, right?

698
00:26:40,588 --> 00:26:42,460
Damn it. All right. I'll take it
out myself. I'm taking it out.

699
00:26:42,537 --> 00:26:44,121
- I'm taking it out.
- Yeah, yeah, remove it.

700
00:26:44,198 --> 00:26:45,394
I'll stabilize it later.

701
00:26:45,471 --> 00:26:47,609
The ex-fix is holding
the entire leg together.

702
00:26:47,686 --> 00:26:49,018
She's not gonna have a leg
if she's dead, Schmitt.

703
00:26:49,095 --> 00:26:50,451
Give me a wrench.

704
00:26:50,528 --> 00:26:52,441
Something like a wrench.
Think. Clamp.

705
00:27:00,571 --> 00:27:02,488
Is she
in rejection again?

706
00:27:02,832 --> 00:27:04,633
The path results will let us
know for certain,

707
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:07,163
but she is in
congestive heart failure.

708
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:09,087
Having two
non-functioning kidneys

709
00:27:09,164 --> 00:27:11,347
- is not making anything easier.
- Damn it.

710
00:27:11,485 --> 00:27:13,558
She's not gonna make it.

711
00:27:13,694 --> 00:27:15,278
It's just a biopsy.

712
00:27:15,355 --> 00:27:18,077
I know, but she's not gonna
get a third heart

713
00:27:18,154 --> 00:27:19,526
while she's
in kidney failure.

714
00:27:19,603 --> 00:27:21,019
I think
we both know that.

715
00:27:21,096 --> 00:27:23,632
Are you upset because
you wanted to hire her?

716
00:27:23,709 --> 00:27:25,149
No!

717
00:27:25,287 --> 00:27:27,863
I'm upset because she's
dedicated her whole life

718
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:29,429
to helping people
find love.

719
00:27:29,506 --> 00:27:31,852
You know she's got like
an 85% success rate. Hmm.

720
00:27:31,929 --> 00:27:33,558
She's an expert
in her field.

721
00:27:33,635 --> 00:27:35,148
She's like a UNOS
of love.

722
00:27:35,225 --> 00:27:36,647
It's got to be
worth something.

723
00:27:36,724 --> 00:27:38,794
Also, you wanted
to hire her.

724
00:27:38,918 --> 00:27:41,426
I'm not the one buying
household goods in bulk.

725
00:27:41,527 --> 00:27:43,035
Do you want to talk
about that?

726
00:27:43,263 --> 00:27:46,015
I'm gonna put in
an internal defibrillator,

727
00:27:46,167 --> 00:27:49,527
and that should help with her
V-Tach and buy her some time.

728
00:27:49,771 --> 00:27:51,738
So you can hire her.

729
00:27:52,176 --> 00:27:53,918
You're not cute.

730
00:27:57,695 --> 00:27:58,725
V-Fib.

731
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:00,678
All right, start CPR.
Let's flip her on her back.

732
00:28:00,755 --> 00:28:02,081
All right,
give me one of epi.

733
00:28:02,158 --> 00:28:03,421
All right, guys,
on my count.

734
00:28:03,498 --> 00:28:05,262
One, two...

735
00:28:10,688 --> 00:28:12,321
Start CPR. Got her?

736
00:28:12,398 --> 00:28:13,699
- And we need the paddles.
- We don't have them.

737
00:28:13,776 --> 00:28:14,821
What? Why?

738
00:28:14,898 --> 00:28:16,488
No electricity.

739
00:28:16,764 --> 00:28:19,350
Come on.
I live, you live, Nisha.

740
00:28:19,427 --> 00:28:21,389
If I get to live,
you get to live, okay?

741
00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:23,460
If I get to live,
you get to live.

742
00:28:23,537 --> 00:28:26,707
Please let her live.
Let her live.

743
00:28:28,695 --> 00:28:29,949
Your neuro exam
looks good.

744
00:28:30,026 --> 00:28:31,900
I'm not worried
about permanent deficits.

745
00:28:31,977 --> 00:28:34,467
But you should stay here for
a few days just to be safe,

746
00:28:34,544 --> 00:28:36,782
and a helmet
would be a great idea.

747
00:28:36,859 --> 00:28:39,548
No. No helmet.
Dad!

748
00:28:39,625 --> 00:28:42,394
I'm never getting back
on that thing.

749
00:28:42,487 --> 00:28:44,874
I thought I wanted
to re-live something, but...

750
00:28:44,951 --> 00:28:46,480
it's not worth it.

751
00:28:46,557 --> 00:28:48,793
I want what I have now.

752
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:51,013
I'm so sorry
I scared you.

753
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:54,504
I'll find a way to get rid
of the bike, okay?

754
00:28:59,798 --> 00:29:02,379
Please let her live. Please.

755
00:29:02,563 --> 00:29:04,285
What's happening?

756
00:29:05,063 --> 00:29:06,532
They can't get
her pulse back.

757
00:29:06,609 --> 00:29:07,614
How long has she
been down?

758
00:29:07,691 --> 00:29:09,816
At least 35 minutes.

759
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,551
How much epi?

760
00:29:13,032 --> 00:29:14,438
7 rounds.

761
00:29:14,515 --> 00:29:17,379
No. She's gone.

762
00:29:19,752 --> 00:29:22,933
Come on.
Come on, Nisha.

763
00:29:31,698 --> 00:29:34,285
I need out of here.
Are you gonna call time of...

764
00:29:34,362 --> 00:29:36,597
Time of death, 18:21.
I need out.

765
00:29:37,049 --> 00:29:40,189
Dr. Avery,
we need to wait until the room

766
00:29:40,266 --> 00:29:42,035
- is completely pressurized.
- Open the door.

767
00:29:42,112 --> 00:29:44,076
Open it! You'll
put yourself at extreme risk!

768
00:29:44,153 --> 00:29:45,677
No! Open the door
and let me out!

769
00:29:45,754 --> 00:29:46,931
Now!

770
00:29:47,008 --> 00:29:49,183
Open the door.
Maggie!

771
00:29:52,328 --> 00:29:54,597
Jackson...
Open the door!

772
00:29:54,741 --> 00:29:56,350
Let me out!

773
00:30:12,493 --> 00:30:15,371
So, my bad hearts
gave me bad kidneys

774
00:30:15,673 --> 00:30:17,480
which gave me
a bad heart again.

775
00:30:17,557 --> 00:30:19,320
Do I go back
on the list?

776
00:30:19,397 --> 00:30:21,190
We put in
an internal defibrillator

777
00:30:21,267 --> 00:30:22,738
to keep your heart
from misfiring,

778
00:30:22,815 --> 00:30:26,235
but, yes, we will put you back
on the list for both organs.

779
00:30:26,312 --> 00:30:29,361
Cece, the wait may be longer
than it was before.

780
00:30:29,438 --> 00:30:31,217
It can be extremely difficult
to find...

781
00:30:31,294 --> 00:30:32,722
A match. I get it.

782
00:30:33,303 --> 00:30:35,215
How's Nisha?

783
00:30:35,513 --> 00:30:38,019
Is she out?

784
00:30:39,086 --> 00:30:41,789
Uh, her injuries
were severe,

785
00:30:41,866 --> 00:30:45,762
and they caused an infection
that spread rapidly.

786
00:30:46,805 --> 00:30:49,499
- So sorry. She didn't make it.

I don't want
another heart.

790
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:57,818
Cece...
I don't want it.

791
00:30:57,895 --> 00:30:59,159
I killed that girl.

792
00:30:59,236 --> 00:31:01,676
That poor baby girl.

793
00:31:01,835 --> 00:31:03,649
I don't want it.

794
00:31:03,726 --> 00:31:05,296
Just... go.

795
00:31:05,373 --> 00:31:09,543

That was a hell
of a case.

849
00:34:25,024 --> 00:34:26,918
She was too far
gone, Bailey.

850
00:34:26,995 --> 00:34:28,785
If it had been any other
type of infection,

851
00:34:28,862 --> 00:34:31,060
the chamber would've worked. Hmm.

852
00:34:31,137 --> 00:34:33,270
It's an excellent addition
to the hospital,

853
00:34:33,347 --> 00:34:35,166
and you're
responsible for it.

854
00:34:35,307 --> 00:34:37,088
You're still pitching
for the job.

855
00:34:37,165 --> 00:34:40,145
Look, I'm not gonna
be better than you.

856
00:34:40,267 --> 00:34:42,658
I haven't been in this office
in so long,

857
00:34:42,735 --> 00:34:44,780
so, by nature,
there'll be kinks.

858
00:34:44,857 --> 00:34:47,418
But out of everyone else, Bailey,
you have to admit that I have...

859
00:34:47,495 --> 00:34:49,488
Richard, do you have
a new sponsor?

860
00:34:49,565 --> 00:34:50,860
Excuse me?

861
00:34:51,116 --> 00:34:52,289
Ollie died.

862
00:34:52,366 --> 00:34:54,815
You said you'd be
a mess when she died.

863
00:34:55,170 --> 00:34:56,666
You been
talking to Catherine?

864
00:34:56,743 --> 00:34:58,244
I don't need to talk
to Catherine.

865
00:34:58,321 --> 00:35:00,892
I remember what happened
the last time you were chief.

866
00:35:00,969 --> 00:35:04,187
I do not want to add more
to your plate right now.

867
00:35:04,264 --> 00:35:05,408
Where are you going?

868
00:35:05,485 --> 00:35:07,752
If you'll excuse me,
Chief,

869
00:35:07,883 --> 00:35:09,354
I need a meeting.

870
00:35:09,445 --> 00:35:10,835
Richard...

871
00:35:11,108 --> 00:35:12,138
- Hi.
- Richard!

872
00:35:12,215 --> 00:35:13,223
- Dr. Bailey!
- What?!

873
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:15,570
I need you to give me
five minutes

874
00:35:15,647 --> 00:35:18,738
to explain why the future
is here and the future is me.

875
00:35:18,815 --> 00:35:21,041
My future,
my future medicine.

876
00:35:21,131 --> 00:35:22,744
Are you drunk, Wilson?

877
00:35:22,936 --> 00:35:26,283
Only mostly, but I did not
do these drunk.

878
00:35:28,397 --> 00:35:29,528
Why are you here?

879
00:35:29,605 --> 00:35:31,088
It's my honeymoon.

880
00:35:39,086 --> 00:35:41,104
You were right.

881
00:35:42,343 --> 00:35:44,657
- About what?
- Jo Wilson's idea.

882
00:35:44,734 --> 00:35:47,186
It is full
of marvel and wonder,

883
00:35:47,263 --> 00:35:49,610
- and it's gonna happen.
- Really?!

884
00:35:49,687 --> 00:35:51,948
I just made her the first
official recipient

885
00:35:52,025 --> 00:35:54,856
of the first surgical
innovation fellowship

886
00:35:54,933 --> 00:35:56,400
at Grey-Sloan Memorial.

887
00:35:56,477 --> 00:35:58,778
- Oh, Dr. Bailey!
- Yeah.

888
00:35:58,855 --> 00:36:00,280
Thank you!

889
00:36:00,452 --> 00:36:02,992
You won't regret it.
I promise.

890
00:36:03,069 --> 00:36:04,528
Where did you get
the money?

891
00:36:04,605 --> 00:36:05,975
I wrote
a personal check.

892
00:36:06,052 --> 00:36:08,611
And I know I won't be sorry,
because I'm running it.

893
00:36:08,688 --> 00:36:10,869
Jo Wilson
will be my fellow.

894
00:36:12,311 --> 00:36:13,662
What?

895
00:36:14,077 --> 00:36:16,360
You bought Jo Wilson?

896
00:36:16,437 --> 00:36:18,108
I saw it as an opportunity
to invest

897
00:36:18,185 --> 00:36:19,684
in the future
of medicine.

898
00:36:19,761 --> 00:36:21,637
I'm downright
philanthropic.

899
00:36:21,714 --> 00:36:23,005
You stole her.

900
00:36:23,082 --> 00:36:26,101
You stole Jo and you stole
my fellowship?

901
00:36:26,178 --> 00:36:27,720
Hey, I didn't
steal anything.

902
00:36:27,797 --> 00:36:30,935
I took it because I'm taking
a step back from my job

903
00:36:31,012 --> 00:36:33,996
in order to find a little joy,
a little tranquility,

904
00:36:34,082 --> 00:36:36,132
and when Wilson
pitched me

905
00:36:36,209 --> 00:36:38,690
her sci-fi
space-medicine-of-the-future

906
00:36:38,767 --> 00:36:40,777
fellowship, I thought,
"That, Miranda Bailey...

907
00:36:40,854 --> 00:36:43,028
That will give you
joy and tranquility."

908
00:36:43,105 --> 00:36:45,533
So I took it
because I wanted it,

909
00:36:45,610 --> 00:36:46,940
and also because

910
00:36:47,017 --> 00:36:49,222
I had the will
and the means to take it,

911
00:36:49,299 --> 00:36:50,506
and you did not.

912
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:52,762
So, I suggest that you do
as I am doing

913
00:36:52,839 --> 00:36:55,002
and go find yourself
some joy.

914
00:36:55,122 --> 00:36:58,025
And if that doesn't work,
take it up with the chief,

915
00:36:58,629 --> 00:37:00,424
'cause that ain't me.

916
00:37:00,608 --> 00:37:02,580
Well, who is it, then?

917
00:37:11,109 --> 00:37:13,823
You're chief?
No idea why.

918
00:37:14,327 --> 00:37:15,844
You're chief?

919
00:37:15,921 --> 00:37:17,151
Interim chief.

920
00:37:17,228 --> 00:37:18,541
It's temporary.

921
00:37:18,618 --> 00:37:20,520
And it's a win-win
for everyone.

922
00:37:20,597 --> 00:37:22,153
Jo gets
this killer fellowship,

923
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:24,952
and I get
this sweet office.

924
00:37:25,029 --> 00:37:27,339
How is that
a win for me?

925
00:37:27,803 --> 00:37:29,394
You get me.

926
00:37:29,763 --> 00:37:31,308
I'm staying.

927
00:37:32,514 --> 00:37:33,612
All right, I get it.

928
00:37:33,689 --> 00:37:35,278
Jo was your work wife
for a minute,

929
00:37:35,355 --> 00:37:38,480
but now she needs to move on
to her own stuff.

930
00:37:38,584 --> 00:37:40,152
It's not like
she's cheating on you.

931
00:37:40,229 --> 00:37:41,641
You'll get to see her
in the hallways.

932
00:37:41,718 --> 00:37:44,407
With Bailey,
who made you chief.

933
00:37:44,484 --> 00:37:47,161
Oh, you sound like
a jealous girlfriend.

934
00:37:50,735 --> 00:37:52,539
Nyah!

935
00:37:52,803 --> 00:37:54,650
I only report to Bailey,

936
00:37:54,727 --> 00:37:56,403
I'm gonna get to work
in a fancy lab

937
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,065
with cellular technology,

938
00:37:58,142 --> 00:38:00,046
and I get dark-blue scrubs,

939
00:38:00,123 --> 00:38:01,409
which makes me
better than you.

940
00:38:01,486 --> 00:38:02,914
And you.

941
00:38:05,614 --> 00:38:07,262
What is that?

942
00:38:07,438 --> 00:38:09,480
My dog, apparently.

943
00:38:12,656 --> 00:38:14,636
Here you go.

944
00:38:15,057 --> 00:38:16,436
That's...

945
00:38:16,859 --> 00:38:17,937
for me?

946
00:38:18,023 --> 00:38:19,238
You had a rough day.

947
00:38:19,315 --> 00:38:21,269
Glad to see
you got sprung.

948
00:38:21,669 --> 00:38:23,086
Thanks.

949
00:38:23,421 --> 00:38:25,753
Well, here, I...
I can pay...

950
00:38:27,246 --> 00:38:28,823
You'll get
the next one.

951
00:38:33,189 --> 00:38:35,256
Why do we often
run for the hills

952
00:38:35,333 --> 00:38:37,763
when we feel
the slightest connection?

953
00:38:41,423 --> 00:38:44,224
What in God's name,
DeLuca?

954
00:38:44,327 --> 00:38:46,544
Hey, Dr. Webber!

955
00:38:47,041 --> 00:38:48,786
She's pretty
awesome, right?

956
00:38:48,897 --> 00:38:50,724
Want to see
what she feels like?

957
00:38:50,882 --> 00:38:53,466
No, I have somewhere
to be.

958
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,433
Okay.

959
00:38:57,807 --> 00:38:59,981
Awake and alive, huh?

960
00:39:00,837 --> 00:39:01,939
Get off.

961
00:39:02,057 --> 00:39:04,672
- Okay.

972
00:39:33,975 --> 00:39:37,342
I'm sorry
about last night.

973
00:39:37,419 --> 00:39:40,324
I...
I don't understand.

974
00:39:40,401 --> 00:39:42,323
Well, I-I panicked
because I...

975
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,695
No
Sorry.

976
00:39:43,927 --> 00:39:46,172
That I understand.
I get why you panicked.

977
00:39:46,249 --> 00:39:50,155
I don't get why Nisha's dead
and we're alive.

978
00:39:50,232 --> 00:39:51,729
Maybe it's because
when we find

979
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:54,141
something or someone
to hold onto,

980
00:39:54,751 --> 00:39:56,618
that feeling
becomes like air...

981
00:39:56,695 --> 00:39:59,284
We were pulled out of the way
of a car and she wasn't.

982
00:39:59,361 --> 00:40:01,217
- Why?
- And we're terrified

983
00:40:01,294 --> 00:40:02,719
we're going to lose it.

984
00:40:02,810 --> 00:40:04,208

a little PTSD.

Your family empire

You've been through a lot.
