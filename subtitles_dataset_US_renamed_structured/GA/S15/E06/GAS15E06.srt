1
00:00:02,813 --> 00:00:05,014
The poet Octavio Paz once wrote,

2
00:00:05,049 --> 00:00:07,546
"The Mexican is familiar with death.

3
00:00:07,582 --> 00:00:10,186
Jokes about it. Caresses it.

4
00:00:10,222 --> 00:00:12,479
Sleeps with it. Celebrates it."

5
00:00:12,515 --> 00:00:14,023
It's called Day of the Dead.

6
00:00:14,548 --> 00:00:16,632
Tyler said it's like a Mexican Halloween,

7
00:00:16,667 --> 00:00:18,283
but he's wrong.

8
00:00:21,721 --> 00:00:24,022
But in a hospital,
death isn't celebrated.

9
00:00:24,057 --> 00:00:25,690
It's avoided at all costs.

10
00:00:27,727 --> 00:00:29,294
It's like the one day of the year

11
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:31,363
where the people who you love that died

12
00:00:31,398 --> 00:00:32,630
come back to be with you.

13
00:00:32,665 --> 00:00:34,065
Not like zombies.

14
00:00:34,101 --> 00:00:35,367
More like spirits.

15
00:00:35,402 --> 00:00:36,524
But not ghosts.

16
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:39,337
<I- And when it comes...- Angels? I don't know.

17
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:41,339
...it's clinical, almost routine.

18
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:43,341
Today in homeroom,
we're making these big altars,

19
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:44,809
like offerings for the dead.

20
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:51,670
But still, with all that practice,

21
00:00:53,421 --> 00:00:54,758
even surgeons are surprised by death.

22
00:00:54,794 --> 00:00:55,885
Three, two, one.

23
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,588
 Hola!

24
00:00:57,624 --> 00:01:01,492
You guys look so beautiful... and scary.

25
00:01:01,528 --> 00:01:04,395
- It's not supposed to be scary.
- It's Dia De Los Muertos.

26
00:01:04,431 --> 00:01:06,831
- We're doing a parade at school.
- So cool!

27
00:01:06,866 --> 00:01:09,400
Especially when it happens
to the ones we love.

28
00:01:09,436 --> 00:01:12,202
- Another date for you?
- Cece is too good at her job.

29
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:14,071
Who is it this time?

30
00:01:14,106 --> 00:01:17,074
Uh, Daniel, who's an English teacher.

31
00:01:17,109 --> 00:01:19,209
Or a professor. I'm not
really sure which one.

32
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:21,612
There's a big difference.
You should find out.

33
00:01:21,648 --> 00:01:23,247
Okay, girls, we should get going.

34
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:29,954
- I'll see you in a bit.
- See you.

35
00:01:29,989 --> 00:01:31,858
Oh, I almost forgot to tell you.

36
00:01:31,893 --> 00:01:33,272
I just got a text from Teddy.

37
00:01:33,307 --> 00:01:35,692
She's planning to speak to Owen today.

38
00:01:39,131 --> 00:01:42,299
I'll believe it when I see it.

39
00:01:48,474 --> 00:01:50,774
Hi.

40
00:01:50,809 --> 00:01:52,242
Hi.

41
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:53,388
Come in.

42
00:01:54,146 --> 00:01:55,578
Thank you for doing this.

43
00:01:55,613 --> 00:01:57,546
It's fine.

44
00:01:57,582 --> 00:01:59,615
What brings you... back to town?

45
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:01,417
Is, uh... Is Amelia home?

46
00:02:01,453 --> 00:02:03,919
- No, but she knows that you're here.
- Okay, good, good. Yeah.

47
00:02:03,955 --> 00:02:05,526
What's going on, Teddy?

48
00:02:06,458 --> 00:02:07,923
I, um...

49
00:02:13,131 --> 00:02:16,099
I'm... I'm sorry, uh, about last month

50
00:02:16,134 --> 00:02:17,733
and just how rude I was and that I...

51
00:02:17,768 --> 00:02:19,668
I left without any kind of explanation.

52
00:02:19,704 --> 00:02:21,937
I just... It's been a really
confusing last few months.

53
00:02:21,973 --> 00:02:23,172
Listen, it's fine.

54
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:26,075
It's me, Teddy. You don't
have to apologize to me.

55
00:02:26,111 --> 00:02:27,425
In fact, I should be the one

56
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:28,810
- apologizing to you.
- Owen, I just... Oh.

57
00:02:28,845 --> 00:02:30,812
Betty? Betty, are you here?!

58
00:02:30,847 --> 00:02:32,214
Uh, no. You drove her to school.

59
00:02:32,249 --> 00:02:35,117
Yeah, and then I took Leo to
daycare, and then the school called

60
00:02:35,152 --> 00:02:36,918
and they said that she never showed up.

61
00:02:36,953 --> 00:02:38,421
- Okay, then let's call her.
- Hi..

62
00:02:38,456 --> 00:02:39,686
I tried, Owen. Her phone is off,

63
00:02:39,722 --> 00:02:41,356
I can't track her,
I cannot see her texts.

64
00:02:41,392 --> 00:02:44,192
- She doesn't want us to find her.
- Okay. Well, let's search the park.

65
00:02:44,228 --> 00:02:45,540
That's where she goes
with her friends, right?

66
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:46,608
To do drugs, probably.

67
00:02:46,644 --> 00:02:48,149
She's not doing drugs. Not yet.

68
00:02:48,184 --> 00:02:49,498
- We're gonna find her.
- It's gonna be okay.

69
00:02:49,533 --> 00:02:51,466
I'm sorry. Can we, uh, talk later?

70
00:02:51,502 --> 00:02:52,800
- Yeah. Of course.
- Thanks.

71
00:02:52,836 --> 00:02:54,436
Um, I-I can help you look for her.

72
00:02:54,471 --> 00:02:56,304
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

73
00:02:58,509 --> 00:02:59,738
So, lunch later?

74
00:02:59,773 --> 00:03:02,343
Well, I have a budget meeting
and then a, uh,

75
00:03:02,378 --> 00:03:05,980
briefing from legal, and then,
um, I'm in surgery.

76
00:03:06,016 --> 00:03:08,215
Oh, hey, can you post
a flier or something

77
00:03:08,251 --> 00:03:10,618
reminding the residents
and the interns to vote?

78
00:03:10,654 --> 00:03:13,287
I am not chief resident anymore.
I am a fellow.

79
00:03:13,322 --> 00:03:14,797
Crap. I knew that.

80
00:03:14,832 --> 00:03:16,457
So, who is, then?

81
00:03:16,492 --> 00:03:18,459
Shouldn't the chief know that?

82
00:03:18,494 --> 00:03:21,529
I... I'm gonna post a flier.

83
00:03:21,565 --> 00:03:23,731
Mmmmmwah!

84
00:03:23,767 --> 00:03:26,634
- Thanks.
- Best chief ever!

85
00:03:28,572 --> 00:03:30,572
Such a good interim First Lady.

86
00:03:30,607 --> 00:03:33,474
I'm trying. He's grumpy all the time.

87
00:03:33,509 --> 00:03:35,209
You sure that's not just marriage?

88
00:03:35,244 --> 00:03:37,044
Just 'cause you're scared of it.

89
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,547
I'm not afraid of anything
but global warming.

90
00:03:39,582 --> 00:03:42,583
- Oh, you know who's single? Meredith.
- Grey?

91
00:03:42,618 --> 00:03:44,552
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, no, she's not into me.

92
00:03:44,587 --> 00:03:45,827
Well, not yet.

93
00:03:45,862 --> 00:03:47,321
Listen, I know that you look like that,

94
00:03:47,356 --> 00:03:49,557
so you're not used to having to,
like, put in the work.

95
00:03:49,592 --> 00:03:51,158
Yeah, women usually
just feed me the grapes.

96
00:03:51,194 --> 00:03:53,694
- Pft. Shut up.
- You started it.

97
00:03:53,729 --> 00:03:55,996
Yes. My liver patient's here.

98
00:03:56,031 --> 00:03:58,499
I'm doing my first solo
transplant surgery today.

99
00:03:58,534 --> 00:04:00,116
- All right, knock 'em dead.
- Yeah.

100
00:04:00,152 --> 00:04:01,235
- Er...
- Mnh-mnh.

101
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:03,193
- Not dead, but... You know what I mean.
- Thanks.

102
00:04:03,229 --> 00:04:05,339
Oh, and, um... and, Link, uh,

103
00:04:05,374 --> 00:04:07,541
Meredith is a tough nut to crack,

104
00:04:07,577 --> 00:04:09,776
but she's worth it.

105
00:04:09,812 --> 00:04:13,013
Dr. Lincoln, I believe
I'm on your service today.

106
00:04:14,116 --> 00:04:15,307
Oh, cool.

107
00:04:15,342 --> 00:04:17,584
Uh, we got a pip-squeak
with a broken arm.

108
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:18,885
Nice and easy.

109
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:23,423
- What's up?
- I've just...

110
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:25,558
never done ortho before.

111
00:04:25,594 --> 00:04:27,427
I'll show you.

112
00:04:30,465 --> 00:04:32,432
No organ music, okay?

113
00:04:32,467 --> 00:04:35,102
I want the deli platter
from the good deli,

114
00:04:35,137 --> 00:04:37,104
and everyone should wear black.
Don't listen to my brother,

115
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:38,538
who says you're all gonna wear white.

116
00:04:38,573 --> 00:04:40,820
In fact, kick him out if he wears white.

117
00:04:40,855 --> 00:04:43,442
I want Sicilian-widow-level mourning.

118
00:04:43,477 --> 00:04:44,977
Can you smack some sense into her?

119
00:04:45,013 --> 00:04:46,879
Hi. Denise. Best friend.

120
00:04:46,914 --> 00:04:48,547
- Hi.
- Hi, Denise.

121
00:04:48,582 --> 00:04:49,982
Uh, Roberta,

122
00:04:50,018 --> 00:04:52,769
you know we brought you in here
because we have a liver for you.

123
00:04:52,804 --> 00:04:54,553
It's on its way as we speak. I know.

124
00:04:54,588 --> 00:04:57,422
I've been burned before.
This time I'm prepared.

125
00:04:57,458 --> 00:04:58,629
She wants me to cry,

126
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:00,726
but I'm not giving her the satisfaction.

127
00:05:00,762 --> 00:05:03,328
- Go ahead.
- Roberta Gibbs, 45 years old,

128
00:05:03,364 --> 00:05:04,797
was born with Wilson's disease,

129
00:05:04,832 --> 00:05:06,999
has received multiple
chelation treatments,

130
00:05:07,035 --> 00:05:08,901
and had a TIPS procedure last year.

131
00:05:08,936 --> 00:05:11,403
She is scheduled for a liver transplant.

132
00:05:11,438 --> 00:05:14,505
- Which I probably won't get.
- Would you stop?

133
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:17,275
Dr. Bailey. UNOS is on the phone.

134
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:18,777
- See?
- Wh...

135
00:05:18,812 --> 00:05:21,079
They're probably calling
to say the liver's ready.

136
00:05:21,114 --> 00:05:23,143
No. I know that look.

137
00:05:23,178 --> 00:05:25,475
That's the "the liver got diverted" look.

138
00:05:27,854 --> 00:05:29,521
I'm sorry.

139
00:05:35,162 --> 00:05:38,797
Okay, uh, none of this comedy
roast, "sing a funny song" crap.

140
00:05:38,832 --> 00:05:41,632
I want a proper funeral,
where everybody's crying.

141
00:05:43,503 --> 00:05:44,635
Write that down.

142
00:06:03,823 --> 00:06:05,388
- Hello, Medina family.
- Oh.

143
00:06:05,424 --> 00:06:07,557
Are we having a party?

144
00:06:07,593 --> 00:06:08,692
It's Dia De Los Muertos.

145
00:06:08,728 --> 00:06:10,040
It's a very important day for us,

146
00:06:10,075 --> 00:06:11,817
but they all wanted to be here
for my daughter.

147
00:06:11,853 --> 00:06:13,296
So, we built our own ofrenda.

148
00:06:13,332 --> 00:06:14,497
I hope it's okay.

149
00:06:14,533 --> 00:06:15,565
- Hello, hello.
- Of course.

150
00:06:15,601 --> 00:06:16,633
Hey.

151
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:18,668
- Who's this?
- I'm Dr. Grey.

152
00:06:18,704 --> 00:06:20,303
Dr. Grey is here to help us today.

153
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:21,705
You're the chief.

154
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:24,073
You can't take out a gallbladder
by yourself?

155
00:06:24,109 --> 00:06:25,508
I can, but, uh,

156
00:06:25,544 --> 00:06:28,578
Flor needs more than a simple
gallbladder removal.

157
00:06:28,614 --> 00:06:30,847
After studying her
scans, we've determined that Flor

158
00:06:30,882 --> 00:06:33,850
has a choledochal cyst
in her biliary system.

159
00:06:33,885 --> 00:06:35,719
- A cyst?
- But don't worry. It's benign.

160
00:06:35,754 --> 00:06:38,270
A cyst? Where? In her belly? Let me see.

161
00:06:38,305 --> 00:06:40,025
-  Mami. Stop.
- The cyst is in her common bile duct...

162
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:41,205
- I'm sorry.
- And it does need to come out

163
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:42,243
as soon as possible

164
00:06:42,278 --> 00:06:44,160
because it can lead to
the growth of cancerous cells.

165
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:46,730
But we're gonna take that out
and reduce that risk to zero.

166
00:06:46,765 --> 00:06:49,766
We do a procedure called
a Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy.

167
00:06:49,801 --> 00:06:52,334
Did you just make that up?

168
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:53,402
It's a procedure where we attach

169
00:06:53,437 --> 00:06:55,671
a piece of your intestine
to your biliary tract.

170
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:58,240
Can everyone please stop talking
about my biliary tract?

171
00:06:58,276 --> 00:06:59,586
I'm sorry. We're almost done.

172
00:06:59,621 --> 00:07:01,543
- Is my baby gonna be okay?
- Yes. She is.

173
00:07:01,579 --> 00:07:03,712
It's a longer surgery
than we originally planned,

174
00:07:03,748 --> 00:07:05,581
but we're gonna take good care of her.

175
00:07:05,616 --> 00:07:07,383
So, Dr. DeLuca will take her upstairs

176
00:07:07,418 --> 00:07:10,000
and prep her for surgery.
We're gonna repeat her LFTs.

177
00:07:10,035 --> 00:07:11,720
- Okay.
- It's very nice to meet all of you.

178
00:07:11,756 --> 00:07:12,767
- Thank you, Doctor.
- Gracias.

179
00:07:12,792 --> 00:07:13,786
- Thank you.

180
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:16,759
Can we talk?

181
00:07:17,828 --> 00:07:19,762
Is everything okay?

182
00:07:22,966 --> 00:07:25,366
When's the last time
you spoke to your dad?

183
00:07:25,402 --> 00:07:29,042
Thatcher? Uh, when Lexie died, I guess.

184
00:07:29,078 --> 00:07:30,267
Yeah.

185
00:07:30,808 --> 00:07:32,373
Why?

186
00:07:32,409 --> 00:07:33,979
Um...

187
00:07:35,813 --> 00:07:37,645
He's sick, Meredith.

188
00:07:37,681 --> 00:07:39,747
His liver? Is he drinking again?

189
00:07:39,783 --> 00:07:41,716
No, he's still sober.

190
00:07:41,751 --> 00:07:44,085
I heard from an A.A. friend this morning.

191
00:07:44,121 --> 00:07:47,033
Thatcher has acute myeloid leukemia.

192
00:07:48,525 --> 00:07:50,758
He's in hospice, Meredith.

193
00:07:50,794 --> 00:07:52,928
He has only a few weeks to live.

194
00:07:57,534 --> 00:07:59,963
- Meredith?
- Huh? Yes?

195
00:08:00,803 --> 00:08:02,136
Did you hear what I said?

196
00:08:02,171 --> 00:08:03,838
Yes.

197
00:08:03,873 --> 00:08:05,306
Thatcher is dying.

198
00:08:05,341 --> 00:08:07,607
I got it. Thank you.

00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:24,669
You guys know someone named Betty?

202
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:41,653
Excuse me. Excuse me.

203
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:46,858
Betty! Betty!

204
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:48,492
Betty!

205
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:51,262
Oh. Um, I'm... I'm sorry.

206
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:54,799
Hey.

207
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:56,367
You want to see what I'm working on?

208
00:08:56,402 --> 00:08:57,802
Mm-hmm.

209
00:09:05,078 --> 00:09:06,711
Mer?

210
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:09,380
My father's dying.

211
00:09:09,415 --> 00:09:12,383
- Oh, my God.

212
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:13,551
Of what?

213
00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:14,846
AML.

214
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:17,488
- You want to talk about it?
- No.

215
00:09:23,929 --> 00:09:25,896
He doesn't even know you exist.

216
00:09:25,931 --> 00:09:28,232
That's how much of a not-father
he's been to me.

217
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:29,800
He doesn't even know I have a sister.

218
00:09:29,835 --> 00:09:31,968
I mean, I was sort of
a love-child situation...

219
00:09:32,004 --> 00:09:34,171
And now he's dying, and he
doesn't even tell me that.

220
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,239
Who told you?

221
00:09:35,274 --> 00:09:37,241
Richard, of all people.

222
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:38,812
What are you gonna do?

223
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:40,711
I don't know.

224
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:41,981
I'm supposed to grieve.

225
00:09:43,115 --> 00:09:46,717
Hello. Brought you a little recharge.

226
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:48,719
Get it? Coffee, rechargeable hearts.

227
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:50,187
- Pretty solid.
- Hey.

228
00:09:50,222 --> 00:09:52,325
You have a deadbeat dad, don't you?

229
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:55,491
That's a weird segue,
but, essentially, yeah.

230
00:09:55,527 --> 00:09:57,794
How would you feel
if you found out he was dying?

231
00:09:59,431 --> 00:10:01,164
What's he dying of?

232
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,733
- No.
- No, no. No, no.

233
00:10:04,603 --> 00:10:06,203
Oh, well, I mean, I'd be

234
00:10:06,238 --> 00:10:08,238
conflicted about it, sure.

235
00:10:08,273 --> 00:10:10,741
Would you want to say goodbye?

236
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:12,554
That I don't know.

237
00:10:13,578 --> 00:10:15,348
That's not helpful.

238
00:10:20,651 --> 00:10:21,836
Hmm?

239
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:24,887
Her deadbeat dad actually is dying.

240
00:10:26,257 --> 00:10:28,624
He and his little friend
were trying to climb the fence,

241
00:10:28,659 --> 00:10:30,259
which he knows he's not supposed to do.

242
00:10:30,294 --> 00:10:31,360
I'm sorry.

243
00:10:31,395 --> 00:10:34,630
I climbed my share of fences
when I was a kid, too.

244
00:10:34,665 --> 00:10:36,265
Can I see this?

245
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,134
Now, uh, can you feel this?

246
00:10:38,169 --> 00:10:40,035
Yeah? Wiggle your fingers for me, J.J.

247
00:10:41,239 --> 00:10:42,304
Hmm.

248
00:10:42,339 --> 00:10:44,106
What do you think, newbie?

249
00:10:44,142 --> 00:10:45,908
My guess is a humerus fracture.

250
00:10:45,943 --> 00:10:48,410
Good guess. You're a natural.

251
00:10:48,445 --> 00:10:50,021
We're gonna get you an X-ray, okay, bud?

252
00:10:50,056 --> 00:10:52,514
Take him up to radiology and
grab me when his results are up.

253
00:10:52,549 --> 00:10:54,849
Am I gonna get to wear a cast?

254
00:10:54,885 --> 00:10:56,652
Hunter wore a cast last year,

255
00:10:56,687 --> 00:10:58,487
and everyone drew funny pictures on it.

256
00:10:58,522 --> 00:11:00,822
I'll even let you pick the color.

257
00:11:00,857 --> 00:11:02,270
Yes!

258
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:05,927
Poor Roberta. Three livers in one year?

259
00:11:05,962 --> 00:11:07,829
That's crappy luck.

260
00:11:07,864 --> 00:11:10,111
Sometimes that's how the dice land.

261
00:11:11,067 --> 00:11:12,434
What the hell?

262
00:11:12,469 --> 00:11:14,269
Parker? Ned Billings?!

263
00:11:14,305 --> 00:11:15,970
We resected his bowel yesterday.

264
00:11:16,006 --> 00:11:17,339
He was fine! What happened?

265
00:11:17,374 --> 00:11:19,441
He coded. Webber thinks he threw a clot.

266
00:11:19,476 --> 00:11:20,506
I'm sorry.

267
00:11:22,313 --> 00:11:23,878
Oh, man!

268
00:11:23,914 --> 00:11:26,647
I'll call his son.

269
00:11:26,683 --> 00:11:28,516
Man, he was an organ donor, too.

270
00:11:28,551 --> 00:11:30,451
Well, that's not an option now.

271
00:11:30,486 --> 00:11:33,521
And he was a blood match for Roberta.

272
00:11:33,556 --> 00:11:35,656
Salt in the wound.

273
00:11:35,692 --> 00:11:38,826
Wilson, that's it. T... Wait.

274
00:11:38,861 --> 00:11:39,993
Hold on! Hold on! Hold on! Hold on!

275
00:11:40,029 --> 00:11:43,130
Parker, how long ago did
Dr. Webber call time of death?

276
00:11:43,165 --> 00:11:45,533
Uh, seven minutes.

277
00:11:45,568 --> 00:11:47,940
Perfect. Five-minute rule.

278
00:11:48,538 --> 00:11:50,003
Hey, Ned.

279
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:52,005
Dr. Bailey, what
are you doing? He's dead!

280
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:54,041
We need to reperfuse the liver.

281
00:11:54,076 --> 00:11:56,335
Let's get, uh, cannulas
and get an ECMO machine

282
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,545
- set up in an O.R.
- His heart stopped.

283
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:00,013
- His organs are useless.
- Yeah. Bag him, please.

284
00:12:00,049 --> 00:12:02,249
Wow. Is she losing it?
Do we need to call someone?

285
00:12:02,284 --> 00:12:04,885
My God, Dr. Bailey,
his liver is as dead as he is!

286
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,721
And we are gonna bring it back to life!

287
00:12:11,749 --> 00:12:13,715
- Go get my husband.
- No. Parker,

288
00:12:13,751 --> 00:12:15,350
get a reperfusion machine.

289
00:12:15,386 --> 00:12:17,786
I've been reading these case
studies out of Europe,

290
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:19,787
- but I've never done one myself.
- Done what?

291
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:21,222
Zombie medicine?!

292
00:12:21,258 --> 00:12:22,357
No, we get him on ECMO,

293
00:12:22,392 --> 00:12:26,127
then use a normothermic
perfusion system for the liver.

294
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:28,897
We can save it,
and we can give it to Roberta.

295
00:12:28,932 --> 00:12:30,965
- Now, help me.
- So, what... you're saying

296
00:12:31,001 --> 00:12:32,700
that warm perfusion will bring
the liver back to life?

297
00:12:32,735 --> 00:12:34,702
Like a corroded penny dipped in acid.

298
00:12:34,737 --> 00:12:36,837
They've done it multiple times.

299
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:40,741
In humans!

300
00:12:40,777 --> 00:12:42,377
- Take over.
- Thank God!

301
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,746
Parker, get the reperfusion machine!

302
00:12:45,782 --> 00:12:47,215
Uh, yes, ma'am.

303
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,199
When are you gonna let me
take you to dinner?

304
00:13:06,235 --> 00:13:08,736
Jo seems to think there's something here.

305
00:13:08,771 --> 00:13:11,732
You know, I have a matchmaker,
and she has a list.

306
00:13:12,942 --> 00:13:15,111
Well, how do I get on that list?

307
00:13:15,978 --> 00:13:18,546
You're not the kind of guy on the list.

308
00:13:18,581 --> 00:13:20,180
And what kind of guy am I?

309
00:13:20,215 --> 00:13:23,216
You know, you're like the
"in an emergency" kind of guy

310
00:13:23,252 --> 00:13:25,853
or "I just got some really bad
news and I can't be alone"

311
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:27,421
kind of guy.

312
00:13:29,992 --> 00:13:31,191
Okay.

313
00:13:31,226 --> 00:13:32,960
Jo will be heartbroken.

314
00:13:32,995 --> 00:13:35,395
Oh. What's the story with you and Jo?

315
00:13:35,431 --> 00:13:38,765
Does Alex have anything
to be worried about?

316
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,101
What's the story with you and Alex?

317
00:13:41,136 --> 00:13:42,970
Does Jo have anything to worry about?

318
00:13:53,449 --> 00:13:55,215
How did Ned's family take it?

319
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:59,219
Sad, but happy some good
might come out of his death.

320
00:13:59,254 --> 00:14:00,507
Okay, Parker,

321
00:14:00,542 --> 00:14:03,622
I need you to prime
the inflow and outflow lines.

322
00:14:03,657 --> 00:14:05,858
Karev, you know what to do.

323
00:14:09,197 --> 00:14:10,262
Good.

324
00:14:10,298 --> 00:14:13,165
- Are you ready?
- All systems go.

325
00:14:31,386 --> 00:14:32,518
This is so stressful.

326
00:14:32,553 --> 00:14:35,654
But good stress, pure.

327
00:14:35,689 --> 00:14:38,757
No "will my husband
come home tonight?" stress,

328
00:14:38,792 --> 00:14:40,826
no red-tape stress,

329
00:14:40,861 --> 00:14:45,597
just "can we save a life or not?" stress.

330
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:52,504
Oh, my God, it worked! Aah!

331
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:53,939
It's alive.

332
00:14:53,974 --> 00:14:55,273
It's alive!

333
00:14:57,912 --> 00:14:59,377
Yeah!

334
00:14:59,413 --> 00:15:01,613
It's functioning. It's a viable liver.

335
00:15:01,649 --> 00:15:03,882
You fish it out
of the garbage or something?

336
00:15:03,918 --> 00:15:05,274
What did UNOS say?

337
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:07,553
As long as the organ procurement
center approves it,

338
00:15:07,588 --> 00:15:10,154
then we're good to go. It's
...It's a directed donation.

339
00:15:11,591 --> 00:15:13,357
Don't forget... the good deli.

340
00:15:13,392 --> 00:15:15,860
- Just...
- Roberta, we have a liver. It's yours.

341
00:15:15,896 --> 00:15:18,228
"As long as the organ
procurement center approves it."

342
00:15:18,264 --> 00:15:20,364
- I don't like my odds.
- I'm sorry about her.

343
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,332
- She's obsessed with death.
- Mm, because I'm dying.

344
00:15:22,368 --> 00:15:24,068
Stop it! Stop talking like that.

345
00:15:24,103 --> 00:15:25,970
You know, some of us
actually want you to live.

346
00:15:26,005 --> 00:15:28,405
Trust me, I want me to live, too.

347
00:15:28,441 --> 00:15:31,075
I'm just preparing for the
reality that I probably won't.

348
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:32,436
Well, you don't have to prepare me.

349
00:15:32,472 --> 00:15:34,178
- I will handle it.
- You're not the only one

350
00:15:34,213 --> 00:15:36,313
who has to be prepared, Denise.

351
00:15:36,348 --> 00:15:38,813
- I'm the one who's dying.
- You're not dying!

352
00:15:40,086 --> 00:15:42,019
I'm sorry, Dr. Karev.

353
00:15:42,055 --> 00:15:44,254
I appreciate that you think
you have a liver for me,

354
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:46,512
and I hope that you are right,

355
00:15:46,925 --> 00:15:49,593
but I have lived with this
condition my entire life.

356
00:15:49,628 --> 00:15:52,762
I have prepared to die young... ish.

357
00:15:52,798 --> 00:15:55,665
And now that I'm close to that
death and statistically unlikely

358
00:15:55,701 --> 00:15:59,703
to experience some magical,
stardust liver miracle,

359
00:15:59,738 --> 00:16:01,572
I just want to make sure
that the people I love

360
00:16:01,607 --> 00:16:03,940
are given the chance to grieve me.

361
00:16:03,976 --> 00:16:06,365
That's not your job to worry about.

362
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:09,446
It is, D. When my father died,

363
00:16:09,482 --> 00:16:13,283
I wanted to throw myself
on his casket and weep.

364
00:16:13,319 --> 00:16:15,185
But instead, I wrote jokes for his eulogy

365
00:16:15,221 --> 00:16:16,953
to make his friends feel better

366
00:16:16,989 --> 00:16:19,555
and then spent 10 years crying
at dog-food commercials

367
00:16:19,591 --> 00:16:23,792
because all of that grief
was still in me,

368
00:16:23,828 --> 00:16:26,052
and it needed a place to go.

369
00:16:27,265 --> 00:16:28,964
You deserve...

370
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,967
to throw yourself
on my casket and weep...

371
00:16:32,003 --> 00:16:33,736
if you want to.

372
00:16:36,547 --> 00:16:38,180
Good speech,

373
00:16:38,309 --> 00:16:41,477
but this doctor's waiting to see
if you want her trash liver.

374
00:16:46,417 --> 00:16:47,983
- Yes, please.
- Yes.

375
00:16:48,019 --> 00:16:50,319
- But if it doesn't work...
- No organ music. String quartet.

376
00:16:50,355 --> 00:16:51,554
Yes.

377
00:16:53,089 --> 00:16:54,656
Okay. Hello, everyone.

378
00:16:54,691 --> 00:16:55,723
 Hola.

379
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:57,792
Okay, kiddo, time to take you up.

380
00:16:59,496 --> 00:17:01,596
- You're gonna be in my surgery?
- Mm-hmm.

381
00:17:01,632 --> 00:17:04,098
Dr. Grey and Dr. Karev and I are
gonna be there the whole time.

382
00:17:04,134 --> 00:17:05,999
So, you're gonna see inside my belly?

383
00:17:06,035 --> 00:17:08,270
Yes, but we're gonna fix you right up.

384
00:17:08,305 --> 00:17:11,439
Mom...

385
00:17:11,475 --> 00:17:14,309
I'm sorry. Do you not want me there?

386
00:17:21,818 --> 00:17:22,984
Um...

387
00:17:23,019 --> 00:17:24,519
You know what, Flor?

388
00:17:24,555 --> 00:17:26,620
I got a whole bunch of work
I need to do today,

389
00:17:26,656 --> 00:17:29,456
and Dr. Grey and Dr. Karev...
I'm their student.

390
00:17:29,492 --> 00:17:31,425
And I don't want them getting distracted

391
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:33,427
trying to teach me
while you're on the table.

392
00:17:33,462 --> 00:17:35,329
I want them focused.

393
00:17:35,364 --> 00:17:36,630
So, if it's okay with you,

394
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:38,499
I'm gonna sit this one out, okay?

395
00:17:40,036 --> 00:17:41,936
Yeah. It's okay with me.

396
00:17:41,971 --> 00:17:43,771
You got this.

397
00:17:43,807 --> 00:17:45,798
Okay. Gracias.

398
00:17:49,478 --> 00:17:51,946
Oh, hey, uh, just give them
a minute, okay?

399
00:17:51,981 --> 00:17:54,248
Okay, mijita, you ready?

400
00:17:55,351 --> 00:17:56,517
Okay.

401
00:18:00,556 --> 00:18:02,122
You gonna come out for a drink tonight?

402
00:18:02,157 --> 00:18:03,824
I don't think so.

403
00:18:03,859 --> 00:18:05,558
Hot date?

404
00:18:05,594 --> 00:18:07,427
What? No. Wh...

405
00:18:09,598 --> 00:18:11,131
What's your deal?

406
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:13,800
I have no deal.

407
00:18:13,836 --> 00:18:15,501
You got a boyfriend or something?

408
00:18:15,537 --> 00:18:17,370
I don't... I'm not...

409
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:21,208
Does it seem like I do?

410
00:18:21,243 --> 00:18:24,310
You seem... nervous.

411
00:18:26,749 --> 00:18:28,048
Do you have a boyfriend?

412
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:29,549
No.

413
00:18:29,584 --> 00:18:30,871
Fellowship year.

414
00:18:30,907 --> 00:18:32,652
Kind of a, uh, relationship
killer, you know?

415
00:18:32,687 --> 00:18:34,420
Oh, yeah, totally.

416
00:18:34,456 --> 00:18:35,888
But I'm open...

417
00:18:35,923 --> 00:18:37,056
to meeting someone.

418
00:18:37,091 --> 00:18:38,891
Cool. Very cool.

419
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:47,532
Wait. Is that a mass?

420
00:18:51,072 --> 00:18:52,772
All right, I'm supposed to be in surgery.

421
00:18:52,807 --> 00:18:54,573
What's up?

422
00:18:54,608 --> 00:18:56,441
Ta-da!

423
00:18:56,477 --> 00:18:57,743
Yeah. It's a liver.

424
00:18:57,779 --> 00:18:59,544
Why is it a liver? It is a liver

425
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:02,681
that was once in a dead man
who is very much alive.

426
00:19:02,716 --> 00:19:04,917
Not... The liver, not the man.
The man is still dead.

427
00:19:04,952 --> 00:19:06,518
Y... This liver survived a cardiac death?

428
00:19:06,553 --> 00:19:08,453
Yep. We brought it back to life.

429
00:19:08,489 --> 00:19:10,855
Oh, crap.

430
00:19:10,891 --> 00:19:12,266
I can't believe UNOS approved this.

431
00:19:12,301 --> 00:19:13,691
They did not.

432
00:19:13,726 --> 00:19:15,293
Well, they said that it's not up to them

433
00:19:15,328 --> 00:19:17,228
since it's technically
a directed donation,

434
00:19:17,264 --> 00:19:19,130
so we called the organ
procurement center.

435
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:22,200
They said they'd get back to us,
and the donor's family consented.

436
00:19:22,235 --> 00:19:23,334
Get back to you?

437
00:19:23,369 --> 00:19:25,937
Uh, they will get back to us
with that approval

438
00:19:25,972 --> 00:19:28,639
because this is
a fully functioning liver.

439
00:19:28,675 --> 00:19:31,142
This is a liver that doesn't even
know it's outside of a body.

440
00:19:31,178 --> 00:19:32,473
Please tell me you didn't

441
00:19:32,498 --> 00:19:34,212
promise this liver to a patient.

442
00:19:34,247 --> 00:19:36,147
- It's functioning.
- No, no, no, no, no.

443
00:19:36,183 --> 00:19:37,916
- Shut it down.
- What?

444
00:19:37,951 --> 00:19:39,483
No. I don't care how cool this is.

445
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:41,585
This liver is not going into a patient.

446
00:19:41,621 --> 00:19:43,121
Alex, we're gonna save a life here

447
00:19:43,156 --> 00:19:44,388
with a liver that would
otherwise be trash.

448
00:19:44,424 --> 00:19:47,458
Which is where our standing would
be with UNOS if this goes bad.

449
00:19:47,493 --> 00:19:48,793
Well, that's not gonna happen.

450
00:19:48,828 --> 00:19:51,261
I know... because you're not doing it.

451
00:19:51,297 --> 00:19:53,050
Shut it down.

452
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:03,467
And she doesn't want me
to see inside her belly.

453
00:20:03,502 --> 00:20:05,170
Well, you can't blame the girl.
That's sweet.

454
00:20:05,206 --> 00:20:08,301
Still, I'm a little bummed. It's
a Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy.

455
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:10,654
There'll be lots of chances
for lots of cool surgeries

456
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:11,717
with little girls

457
00:20:11,742 --> 00:20:13,202
who aren't in love with you.

458
00:20:13,237 --> 00:20:15,371
Unless... Do they all
fall in love with you?

459
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:20,452
I was really looking forward
to working with you, Dr. Grey.

460
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:23,746
Well, there will be lots
of chances for that, too.

461
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:27,383
I got to go check on our girl.

462
00:20:27,418 --> 00:20:28,711
Okay.

463
00:20:31,088 --> 00:20:33,722
Hey, sweet pea. How you doing?

464
00:20:33,757 --> 00:20:35,357
You see your guy out there?

465
00:20:41,598 --> 00:20:44,333
Well, it's definitely a humerus fracture.

466
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:48,370
Okay, so, how long does he
have to be in a cast?

467
00:20:48,406 --> 00:20:54,178
Um, unfortunately...
we also found a mass.

468
00:20:54,213 --> 00:20:56,211
We don't know for sure what it is yet...
A mass?

469
00:20:56,247 --> 00:20:58,414
We think it's what weakened
the bone, causing the break.

470
00:20:58,449 --> 00:21:01,215
We just need to do a quick biopsy.

471
00:21:01,251 --> 00:21:03,037
A biopsy?

472
00:21:04,454 --> 00:21:07,388
Does that mean cancer? Oh, my God.

473
00:21:07,423 --> 00:21:09,157
I cannot believe this is happening.

474
00:21:09,192 --> 00:21:11,244
- Oh, no.
- Mom, come on.

475
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,227
Hey, J.J., what's your mom's name?

476
00:21:13,263 --> 00:21:14,695
- Michelle.
- Michelle, look at me.

477
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:16,230
- Take a breath. All right?
- Okay.

478
00:21:16,266 --> 00:21:17,416
There's good news here.

479
00:21:17,452 --> 00:21:20,034
The good news is the break
brought you in early,

480
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:22,603
so we can figure out what it is
and make a plan.

481
00:21:22,638 --> 00:21:25,406
I won't climb fences again, Mom.

482
00:21:25,442 --> 00:21:27,775
- I promise.
- It's okay, baby.

483
00:21:31,814 --> 00:21:34,048
Hey. What ya got there?

484
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:36,950
Well, I wanted to bring you
lunch, but I couldn't decide,

485
00:21:36,985 --> 00:21:39,619
so I got you enchiladas, no cilantro,

486
00:21:39,654 --> 00:21:43,290
spaghetti, no meatballs,
and then, of course...

487
00:21:43,325 --> 00:21:44,761
...that'll be our Cobb salad,

488
00:21:44,786 --> 00:21:46,126
no bleu cheese.

489
00:21:46,161 --> 00:21:48,095
You really didn't have to do this.

490
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:49,096
Yeah. I think I did.

491
00:21:49,131 --> 00:21:50,797
I know I haven't been
the best boyfriend lately,

492
00:21:50,832 --> 00:21:54,934
so I just wanted to let you know
that I am here for you.

493
00:21:57,339 --> 00:21:58,884
I appreciate that.

494
00:21:59,808 --> 00:22:02,309
But I cannot eat any of this right now.

495
00:22:02,344 --> 00:22:03,743
What's up? You not feeling okay?

496
00:22:03,778 --> 00:22:05,579
I'm feeling a little sad,

497
00:22:05,614 --> 00:22:09,349
with all the grief
in the air today, you know?

498
00:22:09,384 --> 00:22:12,318
Oh. Your mom.

499
00:22:12,353 --> 00:22:14,286
I'm sorry.

500
00:22:14,322 --> 00:22:17,323
You want to, uh,
talk about it a little bit?

501
00:22:22,731 --> 00:22:24,631
I really got to get back to work.

502
00:22:27,235 --> 00:22:28,367
Yeah.

503
00:22:28,402 --> 00:22:32,271
Well, if you need anything, I am here.

504
00:22:32,306 --> 00:22:33,961
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

505
00:22:34,509 --> 00:22:36,475
And if I need some
spaghetti, do you mind?

506
00:22:36,511 --> 00:22:38,424
Yes, please, it's all yours.

507
00:22:45,418 --> 00:22:48,620
We're almost 75% finished
with this anastomosis.

508
00:22:48,656 --> 00:22:50,488
Looks good, even without Loverboy's help.

509
00:22:50,524 --> 00:22:51,517
He was just doing

510
00:22:51,542 --> 00:22:52,691
- what the patient asked him to do.
- Yeah.

511
00:22:52,726 --> 00:22:54,860
If I backed out of every case where
some kid fell in love with me...

512
00:22:54,895 --> 00:22:57,943
Don't finish that sentence, Evilspawn.

513
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,467
- I heard about Thatcher.
- Oh. From Maggie? Or Richard?

514
00:23:02,502 --> 00:23:03,949
Jackson.

515
00:23:04,938 --> 00:23:07,472
- So, you don't want to talk about it?
- I'm not not talking about it.

516
00:23:07,507 --> 00:23:09,374
I'm just... I don't know that
there's much to say.

517
00:23:09,409 --> 00:23:11,543
Take some time if you need it,
go see him,

518
00:23:11,578 --> 00:23:14,146
say goodbye, as much time as you need.

519
00:23:14,181 --> 00:23:16,548
You're friends with the chief now.

520
00:23:16,583 --> 00:23:17,816
Well, I don't know
that I want to see him.

521
00:23:17,851 --> 00:23:20,051
Okay, so, he wasn't father of
the year to you, but still...

522
00:23:20,086 --> 00:23:21,519
Didn't your dad disappear on you?

523
00:23:21,554 --> 00:23:24,355
Yeah. But I got to say goodbye
to him before he died.

524
00:23:24,391 --> 00:23:25,923
And did that make the birthday no-shows

525
00:23:25,958 --> 00:23:28,593
and the crying mom
on the holidays go away?

526
00:23:28,628 --> 00:23:31,429
Did having five minutes with him
after a lifetime of nothing

527
00:23:31,464 --> 00:23:33,864
- make you feel better?
- Suction.

528
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,333
I opened the door for him.

529
00:23:35,368 --> 00:23:37,168
I gave him a piece of my liver.

530
00:23:37,204 --> 00:23:39,103
I opened the door for him
to get to know me.

531
00:23:39,138 --> 00:23:40,505
He did not walk through it.

532
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:41,790
The only time we ever spent together

533
00:23:41,826 --> 00:23:43,908
was when Lexie forced us to be together.

534
00:23:43,943 --> 00:23:46,010
And then when she died,
he completely disappeared.

535
00:23:46,045 --> 00:23:48,379
So, I don't really need to grieve him

536
00:23:48,415 --> 00:23:51,249
because he's been a ghost for years.

537
00:23:51,284 --> 00:23:53,084
You know, our entire career exists

538
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:54,551
to prevent people from dying.

539
00:23:54,587 --> 00:23:56,253
They give out awards for it.

540
00:23:56,288 --> 00:23:58,689
And here's Flor's family
celebrating death.

541
00:23:58,724 --> 00:24:00,390
They're not celebrating death.

542
00:24:00,426 --> 00:24:01,493
They're celebrating the dead.

543
00:24:01,528 --> 00:24:03,360
And inviting them to come back
for a visit.

544
00:24:03,395 --> 00:24:04,961
Maybe they didn't see them
before they died.

545
00:24:04,996 --> 00:24:07,598
Oh, you are not
as clever as you think you are.

546
00:24:07,633 --> 00:24:09,533
I disagree.

547
00:24:09,568 --> 00:24:11,401
It's such crap. Just 'cause he's chief,

548
00:24:11,437 --> 00:24:13,437
he can tell me what I can
and can't do at work?

549
00:24:13,472 --> 00:24:15,606
Sort of what a chief does, yeah.

550
00:24:15,641 --> 00:24:18,542
Whatever. He bends his rules all
the time to save his own patients.

551
00:24:18,577 --> 00:24:20,544
Yeah, but he's the chief.

552
00:24:20,579 --> 00:24:22,446
Okay, are you my friend or his?

553
00:24:22,481 --> 00:24:24,548
Speaking of your friends,

554
00:24:24,583 --> 00:24:26,082
I asked Grey out.

555
00:24:26,118 --> 00:24:27,651
Yes. When's the date?

556
00:24:27,686 --> 00:24:28,885
Yeah, she rejected me,

557
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,754
pretty brutally... again.

558
00:24:30,789 --> 00:24:33,456
She did that to me, too,
for like the first two years.

559
00:24:33,491 --> 00:24:36,092
She's gonna come around.

560
00:24:36,128 --> 00:24:37,727
- Dr. Lincoln.
- Oh.

561
00:24:37,763 --> 00:24:40,596
J.J.'s biopsy results.

562
00:24:40,632 --> 00:24:42,431
Damn it.

563
00:24:42,467 --> 00:24:44,600
Osteosarcoma.

564
00:24:44,636 --> 00:24:47,135
- Isn't that what you...
- Yeah. It is.

565
00:24:47,773 --> 00:24:49,605
Betty?!

566
00:24:49,641 --> 00:24:52,242
It's getting late. She can't
be out there all night.

567
00:24:52,277 --> 00:24:54,405
Damn it, Betty! I never should
have let her go to school.

568
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,452
Should we call the police?

569
00:24:55,477 --> 00:24:56,458
- No.
- Yes.

570
00:24:56,494 --> 00:24:58,815
Listen, she's a teenager.
Teenagers do these things.

571
00:24:58,850 --> 00:24:59,870
Are you kidding me?!

572
00:24:59,895 --> 00:25:01,284
Do you know how many times
my mom would freak out

573
00:25:01,319 --> 00:25:02,685
when I was just down the street
at my girlfriend's house?

574
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,086
Yeah, and when I was 15,

575
00:25:04,121 --> 00:25:05,521
my mom called the police, looking for me,

576
00:25:05,556 --> 00:25:07,022
and when she found me,
I was high on pills,

577
00:25:07,057 --> 00:25:08,324
about to jump off my friend's roof.

578
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:10,626
- Fine. You're right.
- I'm just... Yeah, Betty is not "fine"

579
00:25:10,662 --> 00:25:12,662
because Betty is not a normal teenager!

580
00:25:12,697 --> 00:25:14,664
She's not like you, Owen! She is like me!

581
00:25:14,699 --> 00:25:16,265
And if my mom had not called
the police that day

582
00:25:16,301 --> 00:25:19,669
and if the police had not found me,
I would be very dead right now!

583
00:25:25,009 --> 00:25:26,425
I'm sorry.

584
00:25:27,011 --> 00:25:28,644
I need a meeting.

585
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,680
Okay. I'll take you,
and then I'll pick up Leo.

586
00:25:30,715 --> 00:25:32,782
What if Betty comes back?

587
00:25:32,817 --> 00:25:34,483
Well, I-I can stay here.

588
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:39,104
I mean... I mean, in case she
comes back, I-I-I could be here.

589
00:25:44,594 --> 00:25:46,628
- She's scared.
- No, I-I know. I know.

590
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:53,034
And I'm pregnant with your baby, Owen.

591
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:05,989
Doctor's here, guys.

592
00:26:06,024 --> 00:26:07,415
Doctor's here.

593
00:26:07,451 --> 00:26:10,417
She's doing great. She's in the PACU.

594
00:26:10,453 --> 00:26:11,885
Oh, thank God.

595
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:14,555
- Can we see her?
- Yeah, of course. I'll take you.

596
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:16,490
Come on, guys. Hey, we can finally eat.

597
00:26:16,525 --> 00:26:17,851
Let's go.

598
00:26:19,027 --> 00:26:21,061
- Thank you.
- Okay.

599
00:26:22,565 --> 00:26:23,964
Gracias.

600
00:26:25,735 --> 00:26:28,612
- May I?
- Oh, of course.

601
00:26:30,606 --> 00:26:32,199
Who are all these people?

602
00:26:33,642 --> 00:26:37,611
That is my husband, Oscar,
Laura's father.

603
00:26:37,646 --> 00:26:39,680
And this is Johnny, my son,

604
00:26:39,715 --> 00:26:43,216
and that is my mamá, Lupita,
and my sister, Luisa.

605
00:26:43,252 --> 00:26:44,685
I'm sorry.

606
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,586
Oh, don't be.

607
00:26:47,756 --> 00:26:49,722
They are here with us now.

608
00:26:51,459 --> 00:26:53,226
And this is for you.

609
00:26:53,262 --> 00:26:54,928
Oh, marigolds are beautiful.

610
00:26:54,963 --> 00:26:56,796
It is said that they help guide

611
00:26:56,831 --> 00:26:59,465
our ancestors' spirits back to us.

612
00:26:59,501 --> 00:27:03,036
The veil between our world
and the spirit world

613
00:27:03,071 --> 00:27:04,704
is very thin.

614
00:27:04,739 --> 00:27:07,774
The marigolds, the photos,
the mementos...

615
00:27:07,809 --> 00:27:09,943
they help guide them to us.

616
00:27:23,124 --> 00:27:25,658
- Hey. You paged me?
- Yeah. I did.

617
00:27:25,693 --> 00:27:27,593
The organ procurement center called.

618
00:27:27,629 --> 00:27:31,631
Our directed organ donation
has been approved.

619
00:27:31,666 --> 00:27:33,132
Are you serious?

620
00:27:33,167 --> 00:27:35,668
I want you to book an O.R.
and prep Roberta.

621
00:27:35,703 --> 00:27:38,638
But the liver... Alex told us to
shut down the perfusion machine.

622
00:27:38,673 --> 00:27:40,100
It's dead.

623
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:44,844
The liver is alive.

624
00:27:44,879 --> 00:27:49,014
And as a result, Roberta will be
for many years to come.

625
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:51,651
I don't know if Alex
will forgive me for this.

626
00:27:51,686 --> 00:27:54,453
If Roberta dies
and you could have saved her,

627
00:27:54,488 --> 00:27:56,421
you'll never forgive yourself.

628
00:28:02,498 --> 00:28:05,032
- My father was an English professor.
- Really? Where?

629
00:28:05,067 --> 00:28:06,767
Do you have a relationship
with your father?

630
00:28:07,148 --> 00:28:08,150
- Well...

631
00:28:08,175 --> 00:28:10,939
Why is it that the people who
created us get all the credit?

632
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:13,724
- Well, I...
- Just because they accomplished

633
00:28:13,749 --> 00:28:15,982
the most basic of human
biological functions,

634
00:28:16,018 --> 00:28:17,918
they get a holiday named after them?

635
00:28:17,953 --> 00:28:18,952
And then we're tortured with guilt

636
00:28:18,987 --> 00:28:20,854
if we don't want to have
a relationship with them.

637
00:28:20,889 --> 00:28:23,857
If he wasn't a father to me,
why do I owe him?

638
00:28:23,892 --> 00:28:26,927
And why is it the child
who always has to forgive?

639
00:28:26,962 --> 00:28:29,663
"Because she's your mother.
Because he's your father."

640
00:28:29,698 --> 00:28:31,831
You know what? I am so done

641
00:28:31,867 --> 00:28:34,568
feeling bad about not feeling bad.

642
00:28:34,603 --> 00:28:37,437
I mean, it's sad when somebody
dies, and I wish him peace,

643
00:28:37,472 --> 00:28:39,939
but I will not put myself or my children

644
00:28:39,974 --> 00:28:41,240
through another death

645
00:28:41,276 --> 00:28:43,576
- just to make him feel better.
- Mm-hmm.

646
00:28:43,611 --> 00:28:44,831
So, you understand?

647
00:28:46,914 --> 00:28:50,116
It looks like a telangiectatic
subtype of osteosarcoma.

648
00:28:50,151 --> 00:28:52,585
- What does that even mean?
- It's a tumor that actually...

649
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:55,588
Wait. So, it is cancer? Oh, my God, no.

650
00:28:55,623 --> 00:28:57,316
- Mom?
- Michelle, it...

651
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,927
- Oh, God, no, no.
- Mom? Mom?

652
00:28:59,994 --> 00:29:02,061
Why don't we step outside
and talk about this?

653
00:29:02,097 --> 00:29:05,531
Oh, my God.

654
00:29:05,567 --> 00:29:07,938
No.

655
00:29:08,669 --> 00:29:10,235
- Shh.
- I know. I'm sorry.

656
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:12,871
- I'm a terrible mother. I...
- No, you're not, but...

657
00:29:12,907 --> 00:29:15,608
- Oh, my God.
- ...what you are is... You're scared.

658
00:29:15,643 --> 00:29:17,610
And I'm telling you,
you don't have to be.

659
00:29:17,645 --> 00:29:19,605
Oh, G... But you can't
promise me that, okay?

660
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,279
I can't promise.

661
00:29:21,315 --> 00:29:23,816
But I did have this same tumor
when I was a kid...

662
00:29:23,851 --> 00:29:25,818
same exact tumor.

663
00:29:25,853 --> 00:29:27,886
Mine was on my femur, and it was bigger.

664
00:29:27,922 --> 00:29:29,454
We caught it later than we caught J.J.'s.

665
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:31,456
We treated it, and look at me.

666
00:29:31,492 --> 00:29:33,826
I'm here, Michelle. I'm alive.

667
00:29:33,861 --> 00:29:35,714
So, you had it?

668
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:37,129
And you survived it?

669
00:29:37,164 --> 00:29:39,464
Unless I'm a ghost.

670
00:29:41,335 --> 00:29:43,835
He's gonna be so scared.

671
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:46,303
Yeah, there's gonna be
scary moments, for sure.

672
00:29:46,339 --> 00:29:48,439
For me, the scariest part

673
00:29:48,474 --> 00:29:51,109
was seeing how sad
my mom was all the time.

674
00:29:51,144 --> 00:29:52,476
Mm-hmm.

675
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:54,612
And losing my hair, but that's 'cause...

676
00:29:54,648 --> 00:29:56,313
Look at this hair.

677
00:29:58,885 --> 00:30:00,284
That's it. That's what J.J. needs to see,

678
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:02,086
a little bit at least, every day.

679
00:30:02,122 --> 00:30:03,955
Okay.
- Okay?

680
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:07,258
So, let it out and come back in
when you're ready.

681
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:14,198
So, after your surgery,
we're gonna get you that cast.

682
00:30:14,233 --> 00:30:17,035
What are you thinking? Blue? Green? Pink?

683
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:20,337
Am I gonna lose my hair
and be bald like my grandpa?

684
00:30:20,373 --> 00:30:23,607
You might for a while,
but it'll grow back.

685
00:30:23,643 --> 00:30:25,509
Won't I look weird?

686
00:30:29,915 --> 00:30:31,348
I don't know.

687
00:30:34,887 --> 00:30:36,389
Does this look weird?

688
00:30:36,425 --> 00:30:37,854
Oh, wow.

689
00:30:39,158 --> 00:30:40,857
How about that?

690
00:30:40,893 --> 00:30:41,992
Weird?

691
00:30:42,027 --> 00:30:43,472
Here, you want to give it a try? Come on.

692
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:45,362
- Go ahead. Right there, buddy.
- Wait! Wait, wait, wait!

693
00:30:45,398 --> 00:30:47,698
No, don't cut it. It's too beautiful.

694
00:30:47,733 --> 00:30:48,865
Give me those.

695
00:30:56,208 --> 00:30:57,973
Okay. Just secure that last stitch.

696
00:31:03,114 --> 00:31:04,980
Okay.

697
00:31:11,022 --> 00:31:12,388
Blood flow sounds good.

698
00:31:12,424 --> 00:31:16,158
And we have liftoff, people!

699
00:31:17,795 --> 00:31:22,031
This liver is fully functioning
in this recipient.

700
00:31:22,066 --> 00:31:23,999
We did it!

701
00:31:24,035 --> 00:31:25,701
We really did.

702
00:31:25,737 --> 00:31:29,271
Look at that. Whoo!

703
00:31:29,306 --> 00:31:32,942
Oh... wow.

704
00:31:32,977 --> 00:31:35,911
Oh... nice.

705
00:31:44,555 --> 00:31:46,756
Flowers, too? This is
getting a little silly.

706
00:31:46,791 --> 00:31:48,924
Well, they're not just flowers.
They're marigolds.

707
00:31:50,894 --> 00:31:52,160
The Day of the Dead.

708
00:31:54,658 --> 00:31:56,224
I know you're busy.

709
00:31:56,433 --> 00:31:58,752
I just thought you'd like some company.

710
00:31:58,787 --> 00:32:00,276
Thank you.

711
00:32:01,004 --> 00:32:02,771
I'll leave you to it.

712
00:32:10,814 --> 00:32:12,330
What's your favorite food? Um...

713
00:32:13,183 --> 00:32:14,624
barbecue.

714
00:32:15,185 --> 00:32:18,086
- What's your favorite color?
- Blue. Definitely.

715
00:32:18,922 --> 00:32:20,922
Who's your favorite band?

716
00:32:20,957 --> 00:32:22,423
Hmm. That's a hard one.

717
00:32:22,458 --> 00:32:24,225
Radiohead? No. The Beatles.

718
00:32:24,261 --> 00:32:25,726
Oh, my dad likes The Beatles.

719
00:32:25,762 --> 00:32:27,095
Oh, yeah?

720
00:32:27,697 --> 00:32:29,199
Do you have a girlfriend?

721
00:32:29,234 --> 00:32:32,100
Uh, no, I do not.

722
00:32:32,135 --> 00:32:35,235
Ay. Flor.

723
00:32:39,875 --> 00:32:41,975
Hey.

724
00:32:42,527 --> 00:32:44,312
Hey. Nothing?

725
00:32:44,347 --> 00:32:45,572
No.

726
00:32:46,382 --> 00:32:48,081
You all right?

727
00:32:49,786 --> 00:32:50,884
Thank you for being here.

728
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:53,153
Oh, I just wish that there was
more that I could do.

729
00:32:53,189 --> 00:32:55,523
No. You being here is more than enough.

730
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,726
Shh.

731
00:32:58,761 --> 00:33:01,295
Um, you know, I should've, uh...
I should've talked to you

732
00:33:01,331 --> 00:33:03,464
when I saw you last month
at the hospital.

733
00:33:03,499 --> 00:33:04,998
No, no, I should have...
I-I should... I-I...

734
00:33:05,034 --> 00:33:06,133
I should have done so many things.

735
00:33:06,168 --> 00:33:10,102
I should've called you.
I should've told you about Leo.

736
00:33:10,138 --> 00:33:11,848
For you to find out like
that, it was just...

737
00:33:11,873 --> 00:33:12,872
- No. It's fine.

738
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:14,450
You don't... You don't owe
me any... No, I... Owen...

739
00:33:14,475 --> 00:33:16,008
Honestly... Honestly, I was embarrassed.

740
00:33:16,044 --> 00:33:17,644
When I saw you, I felt embarrassed

741
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:19,846
'cause I could see how all this looked.

742
00:33:19,881 --> 00:33:22,682
You know? And maybe you were right.

743
00:33:22,718 --> 00:33:25,318
You know, you said that I've
always been afraid to be alone.

744
00:33:25,354 --> 00:33:28,120
I come back from Germany,
and I proved that to be right.

745
00:33:28,156 --> 00:33:31,159
But Leo...

746
00:33:32,594 --> 00:33:35,228
But Leo isn't just because I was lonely.

747
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:38,698
I've wanted to be a dad my entire life.

748
00:33:38,734 --> 00:33:40,194
I mean, you know that.

749
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:41,234
I know.

750
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:42,401
Hmm.

751
00:33:42,436 --> 00:33:45,298
Then Leo turned into Leo and Betty and...

752
00:33:46,574 --> 00:33:48,176
and then Amelia.

753
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:56,949
- Owen?
- Hmm?

754
00:33:59,854 --> 00:34:01,320
Are you happy?

755
00:34:06,694 --> 00:34:07,894
Ohh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

756
00:34:07,929 --> 00:34:09,395
He's waking up. I'm sorry. I got to...

757
00:34:09,430 --> 00:34:12,064
Oh, no. Yeah. Go. Do your thing, yeah.

758
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:14,733
- Yeah, um...
- Come on. Come on, little guy.

759
00:34:14,769 --> 00:34:17,168
I'm sorry.

760
00:34:17,204 --> 00:34:18,570
I'm gonna... I'm gonna go.

761
00:34:18,606 --> 00:34:21,507
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

762
00:34:58,943 --> 00:35:00,373
Evening.

763
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:03,294
What happened there?

764
00:35:03,452 --> 00:35:05,285
Oh. Kid with cancer.

765
00:35:15,897 --> 00:35:18,433
In case of emergency.

766
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,033
Hey.

767
00:35:21,069 --> 00:35:22,034
Hey.

768
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:23,169
I like your flower.

769
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:24,971
Thanks.

770
00:35:25,006 --> 00:35:27,774
- How was your date?
- She's way out of my league.

771
00:35:27,809 --> 00:35:29,876
How was yours?

772
00:35:29,911 --> 00:35:32,111
I scared him off.

773
00:35:42,423 --> 00:35:44,349
I'm gonna take the stairs.

774
00:35:52,867 --> 00:35:54,800
- Hey.
- What's up?

775
00:35:54,835 --> 00:35:56,835
The surgery was flawless.

776
00:35:56,871 --> 00:35:59,071
R.I.'s on ultrasound look promising.

777
00:35:59,107 --> 00:36:01,073
Bilirubin levels are decreasing.

778
00:36:01,109 --> 00:36:05,843
You have a fully functioning,
healthy liver, Ms. Gibbs.

779
00:36:05,868 --> 00:36:07,367
So no funeral for you.

780
00:36:10,038 --> 00:36:11,154
Denise, honey,

781
00:36:11,179 --> 00:36:12,606
I wanted you to cry at my funeral.

782
00:36:12,641 --> 00:36:15,206
I know.

783
00:36:15,242 --> 00:36:16,477
I'm gonna live.

784
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:17,550
I told you!

785
00:36:21,183 --> 00:36:22,349
Thank you.

786
00:36:31,593 --> 00:36:33,193
Hey. How'd you feel today?

787
00:36:33,228 --> 00:36:35,228
- What do you mean?
- With ortho?

788
00:36:35,263 --> 00:36:37,430
Oh. Uh, terrific.

789
00:36:38,307 --> 00:36:39,806
You're a great teacher.

790
00:37:12,799 --> 00:37:14,699
Sorry. That was abrupt.

791
00:37:14,735 --> 00:37:17,536
- I-I just had to see if...
- It was perfect.

792
00:37:17,571 --> 00:37:21,340
The, uh, um... When... The...

793
00:37:21,375 --> 00:37:22,441
Are you okay?

794
00:37:22,476 --> 00:37:24,016
That was my first time.

795
00:37:24,745 --> 00:37:27,779
Today. Doing ortho... stuff.

796
00:37:28,815 --> 00:37:30,916
Up until now,
I've been focusing on general,

797
00:37:30,951 --> 00:37:32,984
and it never really felt right, but...

798
00:37:34,621 --> 00:37:36,028
I liked that.

799
00:37:37,958 --> 00:37:39,282
Ortho.

800
00:37:40,393 --> 00:37:43,137
And you're a really great teacher.

801
00:37:43,173 --> 00:37:44,787
Wait.

802
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:46,698
That was your first kiss?

803
00:37:46,733 --> 00:37:47,999
With a...

804
00:37:48,769 --> 00:37:51,210
- guy.
- Oh. Wow.

805
00:37:51,805 --> 00:37:54,072
I'm sorry, dude.

806
00:37:54,107 --> 00:37:56,074
If I would've known that,
I would've never...

807
00:37:56,109 --> 00:37:58,944
Y-You said you would teach me,
and I want to learn.

808
00:37:58,979 --> 00:38:01,879
Okay, look, you're cute
and nerdy and weird,

809
00:38:01,914 --> 00:38:05,808
and that's usually my type, but...

810
00:38:06,485 --> 00:38:09,486
I've done my coming out already.
I can't go through it again.

811
00:38:09,521 --> 00:38:11,589
I can't teach you how to do this.

812
00:38:11,624 --> 00:38:13,057
I'm sorry.

813
00:38:14,927 --> 00:38:16,594
But I, uh...

814
00:38:17,964 --> 00:38:19,930
I thought this was a teaching hospital!

815
00:38:23,603 --> 00:38:26,570
Look, I'm sorry I went
against your chief-ness,

816
00:38:26,606 --> 00:38:28,672
but you can't just go around
controlling what I do in the O.R.

817
00:38:28,708 --> 00:38:30,340
Well, I kinda can 'cause I'm your boss.

818
00:38:30,375 --> 00:38:32,076
I saved a life, though. I...

819
00:38:33,512 --> 00:38:35,112
Wait. Wait. I thought we were fighting.

820
00:38:35,147 --> 00:38:38,448
We are, but I'm also really
turned on by your medical genius.

821
00:38:38,484 --> 00:38:40,150
And the good part about this job
is I've learned

822
00:38:40,185 --> 00:38:41,951
I can do two things at once.

823
00:38:45,124 --> 00:38:48,325
That is not a
private space! We can all see you!

824
00:38:49,168 --> 00:38:51,027
Sorry!

825
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:02,439
Every religion, every country...

826
00:39:05,155 --> 00:39:06,543
...every culture.

827
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:18,120
Death means something different
to all of us.

828
00:39:18,156 --> 00:39:20,523
_

829
00:39:33,337 --> 00:39:35,571
Hi, Mom.

830
00:39:35,606 --> 00:39:38,840
We all have different ideas
about how to honor the dead.

831
00:39:47,684 --> 00:39:49,684
Tell me she's not dead.

832
00:39:51,721 --> 00:39:52,920
She is not dead.

833
00:39:52,955 --> 00:39:55,423
Different ideas of how to grieve.

834
00:39:57,828 --> 00:39:59,160
It's been hard.

835
00:40:02,065 --> 00:40:04,635
I can't say that it hasn't been.

836
00:40:05,602 --> 00:40:07,268
I haven't been going to my meetings.

837
00:40:07,304 --> 00:40:08,670
Different ways of moving on.

838
00:40:11,541 --> 00:40:13,561
Because it just reminds me that...

839
00:40:14,311 --> 00:40:15,577
that you're gone.

840
00:40:20,194 --> 00:40:21,986
Mer.

841
00:40:24,155 --> 00:40:25,219
Good night, Arlene.

842
00:40:25,254 --> 00:40:26,887
Good night, Dr. Grey.

843
00:40:28,725 --> 00:40:30,995
Well, I may not be an expert.

844
00:40:43,472 --> 00:40:46,240
But I do have some experience
with losing people I love.

845
00:40:49,979 --> 00:40:51,979
Hey.

846
00:41:01,189 --> 00:41:02,818
Can I come over?

847
00:41:15,103 --> 00:41:17,738
Hi. I wanted some company.

848
00:41:20,442 --> 00:41:21,841
Hey!

849
00:41:28,816 --> 00:41:30,783
Wh... What's happening?

850
00:41:30,818 --> 00:41:32,139
Mm.

851
00:41:33,388 --> 00:41:34,853
- Hand that over.
- Okay.

852
00:41:34,889 --> 00:41:36,121
No, no. The scissors.

853
00:41:36,157 --> 00:41:38,591
Oh. Okay.

854
00:41:38,626 --> 00:41:40,025
- Let me just...
- Thank you.

855
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:41,494
Well, don't thank me yet.

856
00:41:43,398 --> 00:41:46,131
And I say the right way to grieve...

857
00:41:49,003 --> 00:41:50,503
Be careful. Not too much off the top.

858
00:41:50,538 --> 00:41:52,004
- Aren't they cute together?
- Mm.

859
00:41:52,039 --> 00:41:54,873
You seem weirdly good at that.

860
00:41:54,909 --> 00:41:59,178
Well, the decade
of precision surgical training

861
00:41:59,213 --> 00:42:00,780
definitely comes in handy.

862
00:42:00,815 --> 00:42:02,714
...is however the hell you want.

863
00:42:02,749 --> 00:42:05,550
Do we have a vacuum?
No, we don't have a vacuum!

864
00:42:05,585 --> 00:42:08,187
- Do you...
- Why do I even ask?

865
00:42:09,489 --> 00:42:10,856
Do we have a...
