and lactic acidosis and...

1063
00:41:15,052 --> 00:41:16,896
have you guys been exposed
to any chemicals recently?

1064
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,398
Okay, you're making me nervous,

1065
00:41:18,422 --> 00:41:20,000
like how when a flight attendant
sounds nervous

1066
00:41:20,024 --> 00:41:21,958
and you know you should be nervous. What?

1067
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:24,771
He's gone.

1068
00:41:24,795 --> 00:41:26,573
Maybe we can still catch him, damn fool.

1069
00:41:26,597 --> 00:41:28,742
♪ I'll change your mind ♪

1070
00:41:28,766 --> 00:41:33,503
♪ And I'll be waiting at the borderline ♪
