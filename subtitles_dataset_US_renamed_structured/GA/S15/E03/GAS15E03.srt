<i>In the early days of medicine.</i>

00:00:03,391 --> 00:00:06,296
<i>Surgical students were
perfecting sawing technique</i>

3
00:00:06,378 --> 00:00:07,652
<i>on three branches.</i>

4
00:00:08,166 --> 00:00:10,148
<i>Because when looking at
on a exposed bone</i>

5
00:00:10,205 --> 00:00:13,552
<i>in an amputation,
human instinct is to recoil.</i>

6
00:00:13,634 --> 00:00:14,914
<i>Not cut.</i>

7
00:00:15,603 --> 00:00:17,676
Why did we ever stop?

8
00:00:17,758 --> 00:00:19,412
I mean, I know why we stopped,
but still...

9
00:00:19,494 --> 00:00:20,451
- Yeah.
- Why?

10
00:00:20,533 --> 00:00:23,799
Well, the important thing is,
we have un-stopped.

11
00:00:23,881 --> 00:00:25,854
<i>They needed students
to get out of the habit</i>

12
00:00:25,936 --> 00:00:27,246

I mean, Owen and I haven't
exactly slapped a label on it,

83
00:02:55,794 --> 00:02:57,517
but, uh,
there's been a fair amount

84
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,606
of other kinds of slapping.

85
00:02:59,688 --> 00:03:00,746
Ew.

86
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:02,693

Karev.

95

Yes, the, uh,
new <i>interim</i> chief.

96
00:03:22,548 --> 00:03:24,954
Oh, I, uh,
got you a present

97
00:03:25,036 --> 00:03:27,442
for your... first day.

98
00:03:30,787 --> 00:03:31,925
Wow.

99
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:33,411
I mean, this is gonna be weird,

100
00:03:33,493 --> 00:03:34,711
but I heard you wanted
this job, so...

101
00:03:34,793 --> 00:03:37,274
Yeah, well,
I offered experience,

102
00:03:37,356 --> 00:03:40,818
wisdom, countless hours in the OR,

103
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:44,507
and not to mention that
less tangible quality,

104
00:03:44,589 --> 00:03:46,953
which is that I know
what the hell I'm doing.

105
00:03:47,035 --> 00:03:49,378
But, clearly, Bailey was looking for...

106
00:03:49,734 --> 00:03:51,179
For what?

107
00:03:52,046 --> 00:03:53,588
Something else.

108
00:03:54,027 --> 00:03:55,371
Uh, this is who you need.

109
00:03:55,453 --> 00:03:57,330
Uh, the new guy was looking
for the new chief...

110
00:03:57,412 --> 00:03:59,432
understandably, he thought
it might be me.

111
00:03:59,514 --> 00:04:01,331
Link. Ortho.

112
00:04:01,413 --> 00:04:03,022
Alex Karev.
How can I help?

113
00:04:03,104 --> 00:04:05,862
I want to make prosthetics
that look like this.

114
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:07,813
Superheroes.

115
00:04:08,027 --> 00:04:09,385
Kids will freak out for them.

116
00:04:09,467 --> 00:04:12,790
I can adjust
the, uh, skin color, costume.

117
00:04:12,872 --> 00:04:13,926
Sky's the limit.

118
00:04:14,008 --> 00:04:15,989

119

Right?
Wave of the future.

120
00:04:19,605 --> 00:04:21,214
Not to tell you
how to do your job,

121
00:04:21,296 --> 00:04:22,489
but I think
this is where you, uh,

122
00:04:22,571 --> 00:04:24,255
ask him how much money he needs.

123
00:04:24,337 --> 00:04:25,391
Yeah, thanks.

124
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:26,830
Uh, how much?

125
00:04:26,912 --> 00:04:29,307
Just less than 500 bucks each.

126
00:04:30,334 --> 00:04:31,525
Approved.

127
00:04:31,758 --> 00:04:34,173
But, uh,
we need a better 3-D printer,

128
00:04:34,255 --> 00:04:35,604
and that's 65 grand...

129
00:04:35,687 --> 00:04:37,341
Ohh, steep.

130
00:04:37,423 --> 00:04:39,834
Order it. I'll sign.

131
00:04:42,395 --> 00:04:45,091
- Sweet! I like it, Karev.
- My kind of chief.

132
00:04:45,173 --> 00:04:46,894
Yeah. Firm, decisive,

133
00:04:46,976 --> 00:04:48,395
and here
I thought Bailey just picked you

134
00:04:48,477 --> 00:04:50,636
to make herself look better.

135
00:04:54,573 --> 00:04:55,722
Dr. Altman, Teddy.

136
00:04:55,804 --> 00:04:57,630
Hey. It's me. Again.

137
00:04:57,712 --> 00:04:59,833
Um, things for getting
really complicated over here.

138
00:04:59,915 --> 00:05:02,420
So, if you could call me back,
please, before it's took late.

139
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:05,371
Morning, Doctors.

140
00:05:06,819 --> 00:05:08,760
Wow, okay.
Pants feelings.

141
00:05:08,842 --> 00:05:09,917
"Pants feelings"?

142
00:05:09,999 --> 00:05:11,785
Well,
what would you call it?

143
00:05:12,425 --> 00:05:13,699
What's his story?

144
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,018
Ortho. Not married.

145
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,059
And not unattractive.

146
00:05:17,172 --> 00:05:18,838
You should totally hit that.

147
00:05:25,638 --> 00:05:26,770
Lost?

148
00:05:26,852 --> 00:05:28,147
Oh, still new.

149
00:05:28,229 --> 00:05:29,895
I'm looking for the fastest way
to the ER.

150
00:05:29,977 --> 00:05:31,655
Oh, I know a shortcut.

151
00:05:32,263 --> 00:05:33,828
Lead the way.

152
00:05:35,479 --> 00:05:36,654
What have we got?

153
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:38,374
Table-saw accident in shop class

154
00:05:38,456 --> 00:05:40,946
over at Barrow High... sent blocks
of wood flying into the students.

155
00:05:41,028 --> 00:05:42,280
Is Mr. Buckley okay?

156
00:05:42,362 --> 00:05:44,671
He just kind of fell over
in the middle of the demo.

157
00:05:44,753 --> 00:05:45,969
Yeah, we're gonna
find out for you, okay?

158
00:05:46,051 --> 00:05:48,091
- No, I got this one.
- Couple more rigs just landed,

159
00:05:48,173 --> 00:05:50,104
- and I hear there's worse coming in.
- Okay.

160
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,092
Is this the teacher?

161
00:05:53,174 --> 00:05:54,730
Dave Buckley, 60s,

162
00:05:54,812 --> 00:05:57,621
partial amputations to the right
third and fourth digits.

163
00:05:57,703 --> 00:05:59,559
Kids said he was trying to guide
a student's hand

164
00:05:59,641 --> 00:06:01,752
at the table saw when he
suddenly lost consciousness.

165
00:06:01,834 --> 00:06:02,944
- Why?
- Page Ortho.

166
00:06:03,012 --> 00:06:04,134
They're gonna want him in the OR.

167
00:06:04,202 --> 00:06:05,947
- Webber, you got him?
- Let's get him inside.

168
00:06:06,015 --> 00:06:07,628
All right. Easy. Easy.

169
00:06:08,628 --> 00:06:10,234
What the hell is taking
them so long?

170
00:06:10,316 --> 00:06:12,598
Can we move a little faster,
guys?

171
00:06:14,653 --> 00:06:15,742
Hey, we didn't want to bump it.

172
00:06:15,824 --> 00:06:16,996
Bump what?

173
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:18,394
Why?!

174
00:06:20,508 --> 00:06:22,286

177
00:06:30,696 --> 00:06:31,838
Cece Colvin,

178
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,554
- day eight of dialysis...
- Skip the introductions, Taryn.

179
00:06:34,636 --> 00:06:37,154
We're all friends here.

180
00:06:37,236 --> 00:06:38,624
Good morning, Cece.

181
00:06:38,706 --> 00:06:40,346
Dialysis again?

182
00:06:40,428 --> 00:06:42,111
Maybe you could waterboard me

183
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:44,334
or hit me with a lead pipe
just to mix it up.

184
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:46,308
Well, you don't want to lose
your place on the UNOS list.

185
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:48,634
Okay, but you know the drill.

186
00:06:48,716 --> 00:06:51,013
You work on me,
I work on you.

187
00:06:51,095 --> 00:06:53,840
Let's get the, uh,
dialysis solution.

188
00:06:54,074 --> 00:06:55,637
So, where were we?

189
00:06:55,719 --> 00:06:57,094
Childhood.

190
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,550
Your mother was quite successful.

191
00:06:59,774 --> 00:07:01,247
That must've been intimidating.

192
00:07:01,329 --> 00:07:03,382
- Is that a question, Cece?
- You tell me.

193
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:04,581
It was intimidating.

194
00:07:04,663 --> 00:07:06,809
Feel free to elaborate.

195
00:07:07,411 --> 00:07:10,141
It was very intimidating.

196
00:07:10,442 --> 00:07:12,776
- Don't tug on that.
- Sorry.

197
00:07:13,328 --> 00:07:14,695
Dr. Grey...

198
00:07:14,777 --> 00:07:17,247
saying "yes" to me was not
the end of the process...

199
00:07:17,329 --> 00:07:20,479
it was the beginning.
One-word answers do nothing for me.

200
00:07:20,561 --> 00:07:21,905
Well, I have to pace myself.

201
00:07:21,987 --> 00:07:23,436
I mean, there are
a lot of questions.

202
00:07:23,518 --> 00:07:26,418
Now, we don't want to lose
that port, okay, so watch it.

203
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,504
What was the best quality
you got from your mother?

204
00:07:30,107 --> 00:07:31,849
I would say, uh...

205
00:07:31,931 --> 00:07:33,774
ooh, a strong work ethic.

206
00:07:33,856 --> 00:07:35,651
Which is why
I have to go.

207
00:07:35,733 --> 00:07:37,383
You did hire me, right?

208
00:07:37,465 --> 00:07:38,768
Yes, Cece. I did.

209
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:40,920
But I did not realize there
would be so many questions,

210
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:43,278
and I do have other patients.

211
00:07:43,533 --> 00:07:45,983
Helm, let's make sure
she's not fluid overloaded,

212
00:07:46,065 --> 00:07:47,960
and keep
rechecking her labs, okay?

213
00:07:48,042 --> 00:07:49,336
Will do.

214
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:51,286
Take care, Cece.

215
00:07:53,352 --> 00:07:54,712
All right.

216
00:07:54,868 --> 00:07:56,411
Let's do you.

217
00:07:57,089 --> 00:07:58,175
Uh...

218
00:07:58,257 --> 00:08:00,895
my mother was very intimidating, too.

219
00:08:00,977 --> 00:08:02,574
You have
the new insurance mandates?

220
00:08:02,656 --> 00:08:03,947
Yep, right here.

221
00:08:04,029 --> 00:08:05,883
Uh, and you know
the budget meeting

222
00:08:05,965 --> 00:08:07,319
- was moved to...
- Wednesday.

223
00:08:07,401 --> 00:08:08,754
<i>- Thursday.
- Thursday.</i>

224
00:08:08,836 --> 00:08:10,417
I knew that, uh...

225
00:08:11,337 --> 00:08:13,114
Got it. Right here.

226
00:08:14,589 --> 00:08:16,200
You should start de-stressing.

227
00:08:16,559 --> 00:08:19,426
Well, then, the baton is passed.

228
00:08:19,508 --> 00:08:21,082
I'll leave you to it.

229
00:08:21,164 --> 00:08:24,125
Happy first day,
Interim Chief.

230
00:08:26,236 --> 00:08:27,774
Yeah...

231
00:08:29,471 --> 00:08:31,768
- Are you nervous?
- No.

232
00:08:31,858 --> 00:08:33,553
I mean, the only thing
that would make me nervous

233
00:08:33,635 --> 00:08:34,605
is if you were nervous.

234
00:08:34,687 --> 00:08:36,473
- Are you nervous?
- No.

235
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,028
It's just, um...

236
00:08:40,199 --> 00:08:41,948
You hired me 'cause I'm good,
not 'cause you think

237
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:43,149
I make you look good, right?

238
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:44,337
Correct.

239
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,959
I have trained you.

240
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:48,442
I have entrusted to you

241
00:08:48,547 --> 00:08:51,145
my patients, my doctors,
and my staff

242
00:08:51,227 --> 00:08:53,309
because I believe
in your abilities,

243
00:08:53,391 --> 00:08:54,456
and that belief

244
00:08:54,538 --> 00:08:56,405
fades a little every time
you open your mouth.

245
00:08:56,487 --> 00:08:58,171
So, stop,
and step up.

246
00:08:58,253 --> 00:08:59,241
Chief?

247
00:08:59,337 --> 00:09:00,343
- Yeah?
- Yes?

248
00:09:00,425 --> 00:09:02,773
Uh, just... just, you know, checking in.

249
00:09:02,855 --> 00:09:04,804
I'm supposed to stay with the chief.
So, do I stay with...

250
00:09:04,886 --> 00:09:05,771
- Her.
- Him.

251
00:09:05,853 --> 00:09:08,478
Oh, no.
Uh, you have my office.

252
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,842
You have my parking space.

253
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:12,740
And, therefore,
you have my Dr. Roy.

254
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:16,695
Heavy's the head, Karev.

255
00:09:16,777 --> 00:09:19,261
I'm relaxing already.

256
00:09:25,077 --> 00:09:26,614
<i>Dr. Madigan to...</i>

257
00:09:26,696 --> 00:09:28,275
<i>Dr. Madigan to...</i>

258
00:09:28,358 --> 00:09:30,434
You got 22 bones
in your face and skull,

259
00:09:30,516 --> 00:09:32,624
and you managed
not to break a single one.

260
00:09:32,717 --> 00:09:33,799
You're lucky, dude.

261
00:09:33,881 --> 00:09:35,815
Excuse me, sir? Doctor?

262
00:09:35,897 --> 00:09:37,074
Hey, hey, careful there, buddy.

263
00:09:37,156 --> 00:09:38,192
Lean back down.

264
00:09:38,274 --> 00:09:40,330
Is Mr. Buckley awake yet?

265
00:09:40,426 --> 00:09:42,500
Do you know
why he collapsed?

266
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,192
Was it, like, his heart or s...

267
00:09:44,274 --> 00:09:45,645
Sorry, we don't yet, son.

268
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:46,875
Um...

269
00:09:46,957 --> 00:09:48,381
you know
if anyone's called his family?

270
00:09:48,463 --> 00:09:51,131
Doesn't have any family in town.

271
00:09:51,327 --> 00:09:53,035
- His daughter lives in...
- Maryland.

272
00:09:53,117 --> 00:09:54,580
She lives in Maryland.

273
00:09:54,671 --> 00:09:56,059
And I know you have rules,

274
00:09:56,141 --> 00:09:57,757
but we're all just
really worried about him.

275
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,323
He's a great teacher
and a friend to my son.

276
00:10:00,412 --> 00:10:01,927
So, if you could
just keep us posted?

277
00:10:02,009 --> 00:10:03,690
Oh, we'll update you
when we can.

278
00:10:03,772 --> 00:10:07,065
Dr. Webber, you're gonna
want to see this.

279
00:10:07,953 --> 00:10:10,119
The teacher's blood alcohol level.

280
00:10:10,322 --> 00:10:12,900
I honestly didn't know
it could get that high.

281
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:20,797
Well, I guess
we know why he collapsed.

282
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,471
He was blind drunk.

283
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,393
He knocked over a kid...

284
00:10:25,585 --> 00:10:27,100
Into a table saw.

285
00:10:27,904 --> 00:10:29,330
We need medical in here now!

286
00:10:29,412 --> 00:10:30,280
<i>This kid is bleeding!</i>

287
00:10:30,362 --> 00:10:32,830
<i>I'm so sorry, ma'am.
As soon as we know more.</i>

288
00:10:34,813 --> 00:10:36,938
Son of a bitch.

289
00:10:40,421 --> 00:10:41,464
- Wow.
- Geez.

290
00:10:41,546 --> 00:10:43,225
Pierce, take a look.
The teeth have penetrated

291
00:10:43,307 --> 00:10:45,811
deep into the right chest,
next to the auxiliary artery.

292
00:10:45,893 --> 00:10:47,621
We placed
a chest tube for a hemothorax.

293
00:10:47,703 --> 00:10:49,384
We're gonna
want to do an angio first

294
00:10:49,466 --> 00:10:51,229
to make sure nothing
got yanked around in there.

295
00:10:51,311 --> 00:10:52,762
DeLuca, will you page
Dr. Avery and tell him

296
00:10:52,844 --> 00:10:54,930
we're gonna have to reschedule
that scar revision?

297
00:10:55,012 --> 00:10:56,086
Wait. He left already. Right?

298
00:10:56,168 --> 00:10:57,526
Left?
No. To where?

299
00:10:57,608 --> 00:10:59,956
He took a leave of absence.
He e-mailed all of us.

300
00:11:00,038 --> 00:11:01,407
He handed off
all his patients.

301
00:11:01,489 --> 00:11:03,823
I mean, Plastics is kind
of scrambling, to be honest.

302
00:11:04,053 --> 00:11:05,922
"Leave of absence," right.

303
00:11:06,004 --> 00:11:07,869
So, where'd he go, anyway?

304
00:11:12,314 --> 00:11:14,080
The schedule's a mess,
I know,

305
00:11:14,162 --> 00:11:15,479
but don't take it out on me.

306
00:11:15,561 --> 00:11:17,338
It's our new chief's
first day.

307
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,237
He needs time to learn...

308
00:11:20,205 --> 00:11:22,918
- how to read.
- Uh, Frankie, I certainly hope

309
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,174
you never spoke about me
this way.

310
00:11:24,256 --> 00:11:26,111
- I never needed to.
- You don't need to now.

311
00:11:26,193 --> 00:11:28,830
You see a problem, fix it.
No commentary necessary.

312
00:11:28,912 --> 00:11:29,953
Good morning.

313
00:11:30,035 --> 00:11:33,002
Hi, um,
I-I have cancer fusion cells,

314
00:11:33,084 --> 00:11:36,176
I have innervated electronic
prosthetic skin.

315
00:11:36,258 --> 00:11:38,412
Just, you know, to kick us off.

316
00:11:38,494 --> 00:11:39,564
This is all wrong.

317
00:11:39,646 --> 00:11:42,066
Karev has scheduled
three-hour surgeries

318
00:11:42,148 --> 00:11:44,206
in... 1 and 4,

319
00:11:44,288 --> 00:11:47,369
and 3 is sitting empty
when you could be...

320
00:11:47,451 --> 00:11:49,177
You know what? Mnh.

321
00:11:49,259 --> 00:11:50,803
I should just...

322
00:11:50,885 --> 00:11:53,499
do my gastric stim
<i>now</i>.

323
00:11:53,581 --> 00:11:54,567
Yeah.

324
00:11:54,727 --> 00:11:57,601
That'll smooth out this whole board.

325
00:11:57,683 --> 00:11:58,668
Um.

326
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,459
Oh, look at
your navy blue scrubs.

327
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:02,328
You want in?

328
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:04,051
Wait. No, no, no. Karev.

329
00:12:04,211 --> 00:12:05,324
Sure.

330
00:12:05,409 --> 00:12:07,491
Or we could get started
on my fellowship

331
00:12:07,573 --> 00:12:08,719
that you paid for.

332
00:12:08,801 --> 00:12:11,746
Yeah, great. We'll talk about it
during surgery.

333
00:12:12,282 --> 00:12:15,221
It's Karev. Not Wilson.

334
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,258
Let's prep for a lap chole,

335
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,746
and I'll be down in a moment.

336
00:12:19,828 --> 00:12:20,996
Right away, Dr. Grey.

337
00:12:21,078 --> 00:12:22,477
- Hey.
- Hey.

338
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:23,941
What's up with this e-mail
from Jackson?

339
00:12:24,023 --> 00:12:26,369
- Where did he go?
- I didn't get an e-mail.

340
00:12:27,117 --> 00:12:28,090
Oh, I would hope not.

341
00:12:28,172 --> 00:12:29,690
Yeah. I got a voicemail.

342
00:12:30,052 --> 00:12:31,776
He didn't say exactly
where he was going.

343
00:12:31,858 --> 00:12:34,318
Just said he needed to take
a step back from his whole life

344
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,088
and try to see the bigger picture.

345
00:12:37,142 --> 00:12:40,252
I feel really...
I'm really, um...

346
00:12:40,944 --> 00:12:42,219
"humiliated"

347
00:12:42,301 --> 00:12:43,931
I think is the word
I'm looking for?

348
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:46,203
I'm an award-winning surgeon,
and I pay someone

349
00:12:46,285 --> 00:12:48,596
whose job it is to find me
a sex life.

350
00:12:48,678 --> 00:12:50,377
That's humiliating.

351
00:12:50,473 --> 00:12:53,222
I think the word you're
looking for is "enraged."

352
00:12:53,304 --> 00:12:55,323
Yeah, that's it.

353
00:12:55,774 --> 00:12:57,596
That's the word
I'm looking for.

354
00:12:57,885 --> 00:12:59,792
<i>Dr. Chism to Pediatrics.</i>

355
00:12:59,874 --> 00:13:03,028
- <i>Dr. Chism to Pediatrics.</i>
- It was a table saw, Mom.

356
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:05,914
- He fell into it. I don't know!
- Uh, Doctor, is there any news on our son,

357
00:13:05,996 --> 00:13:07,707
- Kevin? He's had the table saw...
- I don't know, Mom.

358
00:13:07,789 --> 00:13:08,611
We got a call.

359
00:13:08,693 --> 00:13:10,165
We understand the teacher
may have been impaired.

360
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:12,994
- What? Impaired? Like, drunk?
- Oh, my God!

361
00:13:13,076 --> 00:13:14,814
Or high?
And he's using power tools?!

362
00:13:14,896 --> 00:13:15,997
That's... That's not okay.

363
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:17,477
- Mom, the teacher was drunk!
- Is he in surgery already?

364
00:13:17,559 --> 00:13:19,136
- I need an update on my son!
- I'm sorry.

365
00:13:19,218 --> 00:13:20,707
I was paged on a peds consult.

366
00:13:20,789 --> 00:13:22,128
I don't have a lot of
information right now.

367
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:23,946
Then can you just point me
to whoever's in charge?

368
00:13:24,028 --> 00:13:25,784
- Uh, that's you, boss.
- Yeah, I know, all right?

369
00:13:25,866 --> 00:13:26,971
Get these people out of the ER.

370
00:13:27,053 --> 00:13:28,899
Tell them we'll update them
as soon as we know anything.

371
00:13:28,981 --> 00:13:30,712
I-I'll see what I can find out.

372
00:13:30,995 --> 00:13:32,814
Folks, we need this area clear.

373
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:34,916
Please head to the waiting area.
Right this way.

374
00:13:34,998 --> 00:13:36,480
I need an update on my son,
Kevin Gailis.

375
00:13:36,562 --> 00:13:38,576
And I will get that for you
right away, sir.

376
00:13:38,658 --> 00:13:41,474
Yo, dude, a little help.

377
00:13:42,999 --> 00:13:44,225
Nosebleed, huh?

378
00:13:44,307 --> 00:13:46,166
I can't seem to stop it.

379
00:13:46,248 --> 00:13:47,431
That sounds like a rough night.

380
00:13:47,513 --> 00:13:49,314
Been there, trust me.

381
00:13:49,447 --> 00:13:50,879
Have a seat.

382
00:13:52,392 --> 00:13:55,922
Okay, you want to apply pressure
and keep your head forward.

383
00:13:56,004 --> 00:13:57,301
I'll come back to pack it.

384
00:13:57,383 --> 00:14:00,232
And lay off the nose candy.
I'll check on you in a bit.

385
00:14:01,876 --> 00:14:03,643
This guy.

386
00:14:07,939 --> 00:14:09,748
This the guy? He's drunk?

387
00:14:09,835 --> 00:14:10,963
Drunk?

388
00:14:11,473 --> 00:14:12,553
No.

389
00:14:12,635 --> 00:14:14,443
Well, your blood test says otherwise.

390
00:14:14,557 --> 00:14:15,856
Cops want to talk to him.

391
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:17,796
Well, it looks like he's gonna
lose a few fingers.

392
00:14:17,878 --> 00:14:19,631
I need to get him straight
up to the OR

393
00:14:19,713 --> 00:14:20,590
to salvage what I can.

394
00:14:20,672 --> 00:14:22,105
All right. Keep me posted.

395
00:14:22,187 --> 00:14:24,617
The police want to talk to him
as soon as you're done.

396
00:14:26,098 --> 00:14:27,361
How?

397
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:29,482
How did this happen?

398
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:31,591
You know how it happened.

399
00:14:31,793 --> 00:14:34,813
And you need to take
responsibility for your actions.

400
00:14:34,895 --> 00:14:36,943
All right,
let's get him up to the OR.

401
00:14:37,174 --> 00:14:39,440
You need general anesthesia for this?

402
00:14:39,522 --> 00:14:42,162
Um, no, I can just
numb his arm with a block.

403
00:14:44,155 --> 00:14:47,334
Um... I've been
where he's been.

404
00:14:48,277 --> 00:14:50,338
I'd like to talk him
through that if I can.

405
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:52,855
'Cause the more sober he gets...

406
00:14:53,836 --> 00:14:55,746
the worse it's gonna feel.

407
00:15:02,413 --> 00:15:04,577
DeLuca, where did they go?

408
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:06,500
Kevin's BP is still borderline.

409
00:15:06,582 --> 00:15:08,497
I just updated his parents,
and I'm meeting Hunt in the OR.

410
00:15:08,579 --> 00:15:10,757
You mean angio.
I told him to get an angio first.

411
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:13,010
I don't think so.
Hunt said straight to the OR.

412
00:15:15,364 --> 00:15:16,431
When did it become okay

413
00:15:16,513 --> 00:15:19,229
to just run off without
telling someone first?!

414
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:21,369
It's not okay!

415
00:15:26,418 --> 00:15:28,221
Grab and elevate the fundus.

416
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,820
Got it.

417
00:15:30,967 --> 00:15:32,038
Dr. Grey,

418
00:15:32,194 --> 00:15:34,464
Cece's dialysis fluid output is cloudy.

419
00:15:34,546 --> 00:15:36,636
- White count?
- 16,000 with a left shift.

420
00:15:36,718 --> 00:15:38,121
Gram stain and culture the fluid

421
00:15:38,203 --> 00:15:40,805
- and start her on antibiotics.
- Right away.

422
00:15:42,186 --> 00:15:43,354
Anything else, Helm?

423
00:15:43,436 --> 00:15:47,057
Uh, Cece wondered if I could,

424
00:15:47,139 --> 00:15:49,113
uh, ask you about your father
while I'm here...

425
00:15:49,195 --> 00:15:50,471
Get out!

426
00:15:52,061 --> 00:15:54,823
Okay, keep lateral
traction on the fundus.

427
00:15:58,847 --> 00:16:01,783
Make sure Mrs. Jarvis gets
neuro checks every two hours.

428
00:16:01,865 --> 00:16:04,455
No problem,
Dr. Shepherd. I'm on it.

429
00:16:04,764 --> 00:16:06,901
<i>Dr. Patacky...</i>

430
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,658
<i>Dr. Patacky...</i>

431
00:16:09,984 --> 00:16:11,226
Can I help you?

432
00:16:11,308 --> 00:16:12,525
Dr. Shepherd?

433
00:16:12,607 --> 00:16:14,736
I'm... I'm Link, new head of Ortho.

434
00:16:14,818 --> 00:16:16,206
Dr. Lincoln.

435
00:16:16,288 --> 00:16:18,719
Right. Um, welcome.

436
00:16:18,801 --> 00:16:20,532
Uh, yeah, I've seen you around.

437
00:16:20,614 --> 00:16:22,247
I would love to pick your brain

438
00:16:22,329 --> 00:16:23,955
about nerve graft
transfers sometime.

439
00:16:24,037 --> 00:16:26,979
Uh, well, I have a few minutes
between surgeries...

440
00:16:27,061 --> 00:16:30,559
I can't. I got to cut off this
drunk shop teacher's fingers.

441
00:16:30,641 --> 00:16:32,857
Um, how about tonight?

442
00:16:33,864 --> 00:16:35,022
Tonight?

443
00:16:35,217 --> 00:16:37,537
As in after work?

444
00:16:37,619 --> 00:16:39,567
Brains and bones...
hardly seems like work.

445
00:16:39,649 --> 00:16:41,275
But, yeah. 8:00?

446
00:16:41,357 --> 00:16:43,612
- Are you asking me out?
- I am.

447
00:16:44,193 --> 00:16:46,897
- I don't even know you.
- Well, we can fix that.

448
00:16:46,979 --> 00:16:49,776
I heard you like Italian.
I know a great new spot.

449
00:16:50,317 --> 00:16:52,666
I'm sorry, you heard?
Heard where?

450
00:16:54,002 --> 00:16:55,284
Maybe I shouldn't answer that.

451
00:16:55,366 --> 00:16:56,799
Maybe you should.

452
00:16:57,406 --> 00:17:00,727
Okay. Pierce, you ready
for proximal control

453
00:17:00,809 --> 00:17:02,229
of the subclavian if we need it?

454
00:17:02,311 --> 00:17:03,621
You see any vascular injuries?

455
00:17:03,703 --> 00:17:05,481
It's difficult to say.
I needed an angio.

456
00:17:05,563 --> 00:17:07,402
There was 750 of blood
in the chest tube.

457
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:09,341
I made a judgment call.
Are you seriously mad about that?

458
00:17:09,423 --> 00:17:11,612
Am I seriously mad?
You know...

459
00:17:11,741 --> 00:17:12,887
I am.

460
00:17:13,089 --> 00:17:14,386
I am seriously mad

461
00:17:14,468 --> 00:17:16,843
because you can't just
disappear with my patient.

462
00:17:16,925 --> 00:17:18,307
<i>My</i> patient,
and we didn't disappear.

463
00:17:18,389 --> 00:17:20,425
- We came to an OR.
- How's it going in here?

464
00:17:20,624 --> 00:17:22,338
Uh, well, there's
no obvious active bleeding.

465
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:24,202
We're looking at
a pretty big hematoma.

466
00:17:24,284 --> 00:17:25,856
Yeah, I won't keep you.
I'm just wondering

467
00:17:25,938 --> 00:17:28,705
if I should expect any more
romantic advances today,

468
00:17:28,787 --> 00:17:31,034
or if Dr. "Link" was it?

469
00:17:31,672 --> 00:17:33,088
Link? I don't understand.

470
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:35,871
- Wasn't asking you.
- Um, just... just Link.

471
00:17:35,953 --> 00:17:38,123
Are you sure?
Because you also tried to cram

472
00:17:38,205 --> 00:17:39,567
DeLuca down
my throat earlier today.

473
00:17:39,649 --> 00:17:40,767
- What?
- DeLuca?

474
00:17:40,849 --> 00:17:43,032
If someone's gonna be serenading
me after work, I'd like to know.

475
00:17:43,114 --> 00:17:45,753
Uh, like I said, it's just Link.

476
00:17:45,835 --> 00:17:46,907
Ah, thank you.

477
00:17:46,989 --> 00:17:48,497
I would say,
"It's the thought that counts,"

478
00:17:48,579 --> 00:17:50,501
but I'm not sure
what the thought was.

479
00:17:54,163 --> 00:17:56,016
Cram me down her throat?

480
00:17:56,098 --> 00:17:57,653
Look, we got
an active bleed here.

481
00:17:57,735 --> 00:17:58,814
Can we focus, please?

482
00:17:58,896 --> 00:18:00,124
Clamp.

483
00:18:02,085 --> 00:18:03,751
It's called peritonitis.

484
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:06,856
It means we cannot
use your abdomen for dialysis

485
00:18:06,938 --> 00:18:08,329
because it's infected.

486
00:18:08,411 --> 00:18:09,925
We can't use
any of your other ports

487
00:18:10,007 --> 00:18:12,361
because they're closed
from your other surgeries.

488
00:18:12,443 --> 00:18:13,741
Well...

489
00:18:14,153 --> 00:18:15,946
then I will welcome the break.

490
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:18,541
This is potentially
a serious complication, Cece.

491
00:18:18,623 --> 00:18:20,604
I know,
but that's your job.

492
00:18:21,032 --> 00:18:22,448
I'll do mine.

493
00:18:22,537 --> 00:18:25,483
May I speak to Dr. Grey alone now?

494
00:18:25,565 --> 00:18:27,205
I have some private questions.

495
00:18:27,287 --> 00:18:28,382
Of course.

496
00:18:28,472 --> 00:18:31,580
This is a teaching hospital, Cece.

497
00:18:31,662 --> 00:18:32,812
Okay.

498
00:18:32,904 --> 00:18:35,422
We'll talk sexual proclivities

499
00:18:35,504 --> 00:18:37,620
in front of your student,
if that's the way you want it.

500
00:18:37,702 --> 00:18:40,544
That is not anything I want
to talk about with anyone.

501
00:18:40,626 --> 00:18:42,034
My main priority right now

502
00:18:42,116 --> 00:18:43,760
is getting you back on
this dialysis.

503
00:18:43,842 --> 00:18:47,440
My port's not the only thing
closed off in here.

504
00:18:50,586 --> 00:18:51,671
Rongeurs.

505
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,346
This is gonna sound worse
than it feels.

506
00:18:57,289 --> 00:19:00,046
God, I-I hope all the boys
pull through.

507
00:19:00,128 --> 00:19:01,190
Oh.

508
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:03,944
I know you do.
I know.

509
00:19:05,232 --> 00:19:07,270
What you're feeling
right now...

510
00:19:07,352 --> 00:19:10,026
the fear, the guilt,

511
00:19:10,323 --> 00:19:13,034
hurting the people
that you love the most...

512
00:19:13,695 --> 00:19:16,104
that's what rock bottom
looks like,

513
00:19:16,398 --> 00:19:19,795
but only if you admit
that you have a problem.

514
00:19:19,877 --> 00:19:22,651
Kevin, he gets scared of the saws.

515
00:19:22,805 --> 00:19:26,307
The sound. I was trying to help him.

516
00:19:26,455 --> 00:19:28,620
I-I slipped. I-It... It was an accident.

517
00:19:28,702 --> 00:19:30,794
Look, how long do you want
to keep telling that lie?

518
00:19:30,876 --> 00:19:32,279
Isn't it exhausting?

519
00:19:32,361 --> 00:19:34,076
How many more people
do you need to hurt?

520
00:19:34,158 --> 00:19:35,549
I-I slipped. I-I-I swear.

521
00:19:35,631 --> 00:19:37,737
Alcohol does tend
to affect one's balance.

522
00:19:37,819 --> 00:19:39,768
Dr. Webber, I think that's enough.

523
00:19:40,169 --> 00:19:42,117
How's it going in here?
Cops need a timeline.

524
00:19:42,199 --> 00:19:44,932
- 10 to 20 years, I'd say.
- Would you give it a rest?

525
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:48,503
Half an hour, Chief. Cut, shave, close.

526
00:19:49,341 --> 00:19:51,038
What's going on?

527
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:53,481
Just trying to offer this man
some help is all.

528
00:19:53,563 --> 00:19:55,197
I told you... I don't drink.

529
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:56,620
I-I-I don't drink!

530
00:19:56,702 --> 00:19:58,881
That boy has a sawblade in his chest.

531
00:19:58,963 --> 00:20:01,409
- You have to own what you did.
- I didn't.

532
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:02,808
I-I-I wouldn't...

533
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:04,675
An innocent boy is fighting for his life.

534
00:20:04,757 --> 00:20:06,291
Webber, I really think I have
things under control here...

535
00:20:06,373 --> 00:20:09,245
- The least you can do is tell the truth!
- Enough, Dr. Webber!

536
00:20:12,225 --> 00:20:14,101
You're gonna lecture <i>me,</i> Karev?

537
00:20:14,183 --> 00:20:16,886
I trained you when you didn't
know your ass from a scrub room.

538
00:20:16,968 --> 00:20:18,182
And now I'm your chief,

539
00:20:18,264 --> 00:20:20,307
and I want you out of this OR.

540
00:20:29,217 --> 00:20:30,682
Your mentor?

541
00:20:31,787 --> 00:20:33,721
Fun first day.

542
00:20:37,609 --> 00:20:39,791
So, this electronic skin
not only helps amputees

543
00:20:39,873 --> 00:20:41,270
regain the sense of touch,

544
00:20:41,352 --> 00:20:44,613
it's an elastomer
that reforms covalent bonds...

545
00:20:44,695 --> 00:20:46,076
Oh, yeah,
hold that thought.

546
00:20:46,158 --> 00:20:49,239
Uh, hey, my gastric stim patient
needs to go to recovery.

547
00:20:49,321 --> 00:20:50,681
May be a little while.

548
00:20:50,763 --> 00:20:52,205
This morning shift was down
a couple nurses,

549
00:20:52,287 --> 00:20:53,414
and it never got covered.

550
00:20:53,496 --> 00:20:55,295
- What? Why?
- I would tell you,

551
00:20:55,377 --> 00:20:57,948
but I don't want to speak badly
about the chief.

552
00:20:58,831 --> 00:21:01,010
- Karev!
- Yes, ma'am. Yeah.

553
00:21:01,092 --> 00:21:03,151
No, not you,
your husband.

554
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:05,056
He knows to look

555
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:07,206
at the OR staff report
in the mornings, right?

556
00:21:07,288 --> 00:21:08,564
I don't know
what my husband knows.

557
00:21:08,646 --> 00:21:10,571
I don't either, it turns out.

558
00:21:10,653 --> 00:21:11,988
I need to go check some things.

559
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:14,152
I'm just gonna e-mail you stuff!

560
00:21:16,602 --> 00:21:19,488
Try a 60-second sonication.

561
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:20,566
I did that yesterday

562
00:21:20,648 --> 00:21:22,583
while you were off in the OR
drilling burr holes,

563
00:21:22,665 --> 00:21:24,175
and I was feeling neglected.

564
00:21:24,287 --> 00:21:26,824
Oh. Well,
if you want a change of pace,

565
00:21:26,906 --> 00:21:29,528
I've got an epidural abscess
you can take off my plate.

566
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:31,870
Shepherd, I don't work for you.

567
00:21:31,952 --> 00:21:33,020
I'm your research partner

568
00:21:33,102 --> 00:21:34,870
and your sometimes lover.

569
00:21:35,163 --> 00:21:36,327
One time.

570
00:21:36,731 --> 00:21:38,086
It was one time, Tom.

571
00:21:38,168 --> 00:21:39,913
Yeah, but who knows
what the future holds?

572
00:21:40,148 --> 00:21:41,753
Did my sister put you up to this?

573
00:21:41,835 --> 00:21:43,152
No, but I like the way you think.

574
00:21:43,234 --> 00:21:44,294
Can we invite her? 'Cause...

575
00:21:44,376 --> 00:21:46,417
Okay, why is everyone
against me and Owen?

576
00:21:46,499 --> 00:21:47,956
I mean, I know that
we hurt each other,

577
00:21:48,038 --> 00:21:49,341
but now we are
un-hurting each other.

578
00:21:49,423 --> 00:21:51,108
That's a good thing, right?

579
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:53,683
I mean, life happens.
Life comes around.

580
00:21:53,765 --> 00:21:55,481
- Life surprises you.
- Life is boring.

581
00:21:55,563 --> 00:21:57,019
- What?
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

582
00:21:57,101 --> 00:21:58,495
I meant, uh,
this conversation's boring.

583
00:21:58,577 --> 00:22:00,911
It's boring me, but it makes
the epidural abscess,

584
00:22:00,993 --> 00:22:02,792
uh, sound thrilling, so...

585
00:22:03,025 --> 00:22:04,684
What? Is it something I said?

586
00:22:04,766 --> 00:22:06,271
I don't like being alone.

587
00:22:06,996 --> 00:22:08,883
The chest-blade kid
is still in the OR.

588
00:22:08,965 --> 00:22:10,872
The other shop-class kids
have been discharged.

589
00:22:10,954 --> 00:22:12,495
Uh, the cops
want a time-stamped copy

590
00:22:12,577 --> 00:22:13,435
of the teacher's tox screens.

591
00:22:13,517 --> 00:22:15,805
A guy came in with a nosebleed,
but I took care of that.

592
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:19,515
And these are more
purchase-requisition forms.

593
00:22:20,343 --> 00:22:22,331
<i>Charge Nurse, dial 80.</i>

594
00:22:22,413 --> 00:22:24,307
<i>Charge Nurse, dial 80.</i>

595
00:22:25,109 --> 00:22:26,925
Find me a pen.

596
00:22:27,183 --> 00:22:30,222
Excuse me, Doctor.
I'm Ava Krug, Arthur's mom.

597
00:22:30,304 --> 00:22:31,425
We spoke earlier?

598
00:22:31,507 --> 00:22:33,856
Oh, yes, yes, uh,
is your son all right?

599
00:22:33,938 --> 00:22:35,696
Yeah, he's fine.
He's fine.

600
00:22:35,778 --> 00:22:37,592
We're just staying to see
how Kevin comes out, so...

601
00:22:37,674 --> 00:22:39,880
Well, we promise to give him
the best possible care.

602
00:22:39,962 --> 00:22:41,666
We've got two of our finest surgeons.

603
00:22:41,748 --> 00:22:43,316
And to check on Mr. Buckley.

604
00:22:43,398 --> 00:22:44,846
It's terrible
what that teacher did.

605
00:22:44,928 --> 00:22:47,088
It's just unconscionable.

606
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:48,743
That's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

607
00:22:48,825 --> 00:22:49,972
It just doesn't make sense.

608
00:22:50,054 --> 00:22:52,245
Alcoholics are very good at their job,

609
00:22:52,327 --> 00:22:53,589
until they aren't,

610
00:22:53,704 --> 00:22:55,200
and until they take responsibility...

611
00:22:55,282 --> 00:22:57,053
I know. I know drunks.

612
00:22:57,135 --> 00:22:59,095
Arthur's dad is one,
and my dad was one.

613
00:22:59,177 --> 00:23:00,518
I know the signs.

614
00:23:00,711 --> 00:23:03,364
I was at Mr. Buckley's
daughter's wedding last year,

615
00:23:03,446 --> 00:23:05,926
and he got tipsy
off two sips of champagne.

616
00:23:06,008 --> 00:23:07,298
He's not a drinker.

617
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:09,823
And he's the only decent guy
in Arthur's life.

618
00:23:10,124 --> 00:23:11,484
It j...

619
00:23:11,702 --> 00:23:13,542
It just doesn't make sense.

620
00:23:18,068 --> 00:23:19,430
I miss you.

621
00:23:19,535 --> 00:23:21,017
- What?
- I miss working with you.

622
00:23:21,099 --> 00:23:24,282
We had a rhythm.
You know, we had a shorthand.

623
00:23:25,074 --> 00:23:27,995
What do you know about
alternative dialysis access?

624
00:23:28,077 --> 00:23:30,652
Uh, I-I did read a study
in which certain enzymes

625
00:23:30,734 --> 00:23:33,020
helped improve the longevity
of vascular access.

626
00:23:33,102 --> 00:23:34,620
- Send it to me.
- No, in mice.

627
00:23:34,702 --> 00:23:36,191
Human trials are still years away.

628
00:23:36,273 --> 00:23:37,500
But this is what
I'm talking about!

629
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:40,003
You and I,
bouncing ideas off each other.

630
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:41,651
- Steal me back.
- I can't.

631
00:23:41,757 --> 00:23:43,316
You know,
Bailey's not your boss anymore.

632
00:23:43,398 --> 00:23:44,574
In fact, you are her boss.

633
00:23:44,656 --> 00:23:46,823
So, you could tell her
that you're taking me back.

634
00:23:46,905 --> 00:23:47,949
No.

635
00:23:48,031 --> 00:23:50,183
But we work so well together.

636
00:23:50,265 --> 00:23:52,722
You know, Bailey's technically
not your boss, either.

637
00:23:52,804 --> 00:23:54,347
I mean, a fellow is not a resident.

638
00:23:54,429 --> 00:23:55,466
It's more like a partnership.

639
00:23:55,548 --> 00:23:57,120
So, you should just
tell her what you need.

640
00:23:57,202 --> 00:23:59,270
- What if I piss her off?
- I don't know.

641
00:23:59,352 --> 00:24:01,198
You could tell on her to the chief.

642
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:03,013
He likes you.

643
00:24:07,958 --> 00:24:09,912
Good work on controlling
that bleed, DeLuca.

644
00:24:09,994 --> 00:24:11,788
- Thank you, Dr. Hunt.
- Can we not pop the champagne

645
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:13,298
just yet, please?

646
00:24:13,756 --> 00:24:16,089
Is everything all right, Pierce?

647
00:24:16,893 --> 00:24:19,432
Uh, you mean besides the sawblade?

648
00:24:20,106 --> 00:24:22,138
I'm asking
if you have an issue with me.

649
00:24:22,241 --> 00:24:23,769
Or maybe with me and Amelia?

650
00:24:23,851 --> 00:24:25,982
I'm asking if there's something
that we need to talk about.

651
00:24:26,064 --> 00:24:28,824
My issue is that this kid's arm

652
00:24:28,906 --> 00:24:30,420
is turning white.

653
00:24:30,502 --> 00:24:31,687
DeLuca.

654
00:24:37,232 --> 00:24:39,028
I lost the signal. There's no blood flow.

655
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:41,153
He's gonna lose his arm
because you rushed.

656
00:24:41,235 --> 00:24:42,928
Because you rush into everything.

657
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:44,953
This... This is what I was afraid of.

658
00:24:45,035 --> 00:24:46,949
This is why I wanted the angio...

659
00:24:47,031 --> 00:24:48,910
There wasn't time for an angio!

660
00:24:50,337 --> 00:24:52,925
I'm a trauma surgeon.
I did years of field medicine,

661
00:24:53,007 --> 00:24:55,500
and I saw a lot of ammo
embedded into men's chests.

662
00:24:55,582 --> 00:24:57,558
I read the situation,
I made a call,

663
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,919
and this kid is alive
because of that call.

664
00:24:59,001 --> 00:25:00,574
So, whatever your issues
that you're having,

665
00:25:00,656 --> 00:25:02,018
they're not because
of my medical decisions.

666
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,615
I think we both know that.

667
00:25:08,749 --> 00:25:11,094

668
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:14,253

669
00:25:16,953 --> 00:25:18,800
Hey there, Mr. Buckley.

670
00:25:20,599 --> 00:25:22,214
How you feeling?

671
00:25:22,437 --> 00:25:24,886
I've... I've been better.

672
00:25:24,978 --> 00:25:27,289
H-How are Arthur and Kevin?

673
00:25:27,393 --> 00:25:28,987
I'll check.

674
00:25:33,703 --> 00:25:36,481
Um, meantime...

675
00:25:50,152 --> 00:25:52,714
I know what withdrawal feels like.

676

00:26:06,318 --> 00:26:08,501
couldn't wait any longer
or she'd miss choir.

680
00:26:08,583 --> 00:26:10,169
Amanda Perez's dad can't believe

681
00:26:10,251 --> 00:26:12,407
you missed her esophageal
Atresia follow-up

682
00:26:12,489 --> 00:26:14,511
and is composing an angry e-mail.

683
00:26:14,593 --> 00:26:15,782
Very disappointed.

684
00:26:15,864 --> 00:26:17,995
I could do without the tone, Roy.

685
00:26:25,463 --> 00:26:27,456
Did we mock our attendings?

686
00:26:27,647 --> 00:26:30,323
- Never to their face.
- That's what I'm saying.

<i>♪ In no hurry to go nowhere ♪</i>

688
00:26:32,645 --> 00:26:34,127
Why doesn't anyone tell you that,

689
00:26:34,209 --> 00:26:36,394
if you take this job,
you piss everybody off,

690
00:26:36,476 --> 00:26:37,873
and never get to practice medicine?

691
00:26:37,955 --> 00:26:39,994
Everyone who ever takes that job
tells you that.

692
00:26:40,076 --> 00:26:41,368
I'm a bad listener.

693
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:43,073
Cece says I'm closed off.

694
00:26:43,155 --> 00:26:44,501
- Who?
- Cece.

695
00:26:44,583 --> 00:26:46,443
- My matchmaker patient.
- Wait.

00:26:46,525 --> 00:26:48,181
Jo told me you hired a matchmaker,

697
00:26:48,263 --> 00:26:49,670
but I thought she was kidding.

698
00:26:49,752 --> 00:26:50,735
I wish.

699
00:26:50,817 --> 00:26:52,614
It's just there's so many questions.

700
00:26:52,696 --> 00:26:53,691
It's exhausting.

701
00:26:53,773 --> 00:26:56,020
I mean, why can't it just
be a fancy restaurant...

702
00:26:56,102 --> 00:26:58,630
I go in, give them money,
they ask me if I have any allergies,

703
00:26:58,712 --> 00:27:00,157
and they give you a steak?

704
00:27:00,239 --> 00:27:01,435
That's a different service.

705
00:27:01,517 --> 00:27:03,197
She wants me
to spew emotional vomit

706
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:04,482
every time I walk into a room,

707
00:27:04,564 --> 00:27:07,262
and I'm not just not...
I'm not Amelia.

708
00:27:07,344 --> 00:27:09,370
Where does this woman get the idea
that you're closed off?

709
00:27:09,452 --> 00:27:10,656
I mean, I know I am.

710
00:27:10,738 --> 00:27:13,439
But... so that's it?
I just die alone?

711
00:27:13,552 --> 00:27:15,308
♪ Like it's the last time ♪

712
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:17,675
Listen, you know what?

713
00:27:18,067 --> 00:27:21,402
With everything and everyone
that you've lost in your life,

714
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:23,744
you have earned the right
to pick and choose

715
00:27:23,826 --> 00:27:25,132
whoever you want to let in.

716
00:27:25,214 --> 00:27:26,733
Exactly.

717
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:30,220
I mean, I know it's not easy
to get to know me,

718
00:27:30,302 --> 00:27:32,269
but it's not like
you can't get to know me.

719
00:27:32,404 --> 00:27:33,646
Yeah, if the front door's locked,

720
00:27:33,728 --> 00:27:36,027
try the back.
Or a window.

721
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:37,504
<i>♪ Head up in the clouds ♪</i>

722
00:27:37,586 --> 00:27:39,115
- <i>♪ Shuffle body is moving ♪</i>
- That's it.

723
00:27:39,197 --> 00:27:40,485
What's it?

724
00:27:41,788 --> 00:27:44,151
The back door
for Cece.

725
00:27:44,233 --> 00:27:46,244
You are an excellent chief!

726
00:27:47,144 --> 00:27:48,301
Thank you.

727
00:27:48,487 --> 00:27:49,836
<i>♪ Head up in the clouds ♪</i>

728
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:51,687
<i>♪ Shuffle body is moving ♪</i>

729
00:27:51,769 --> 00:27:53,058
Buckley's wasted again.

730
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:54,545
What? How?

731
00:27:54,627 --> 00:27:56,704
Think you need to talk to
Dr. Webber.

732
00:27:57,971 --> 00:27:59,958
The distal anastomosis
looks good.

733
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,844
So, let's do a quick back-bleed,

734
00:28:01,926 --> 00:28:03,504
and then we can remove the clamps.

735
00:28:06,282 --> 00:28:08,921
All right,
BP is stable... 110 over 75,

736
00:28:09,003 --> 00:28:11,850
and I got a strong
radial and ulnar pulse.

737
00:28:12,101 --> 00:28:13,746
He gets to keep his arm.

738
00:28:18,601 --> 00:28:20,176
I'm not in a rush.

739
00:28:20,739 --> 00:28:23,418
With Amelia or Leo. Or Betty.

740
00:28:24,006 --> 00:28:27,080
They aren't a whim,
they aren't impulse,

741
00:28:27,162 --> 00:28:30,309
and if they were, they were
the best impulse of my life.

742
00:28:30,581 --> 00:28:32,312
I'm not going anywhere.

743
00:28:33,706 --> 00:28:35,239
I know.

744
00:28:36,405 --> 00:28:38,414
I know. I'm...

745
00:28:38,962 --> 00:28:40,338
I'm sorry.

746
00:28:42,844 --> 00:28:45,138
Mm. Um, if you guys are okay here,

747
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:47,760
I will, uh,
go and update the parents.

748
00:28:47,842 --> 00:28:49,512
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

749
00:28:59,235 --> 00:29:00,644
Hey, can you track down Chief Karev?

750
00:29:00,726 --> 00:29:03,121
I need him to sign a requisition
before he gets fired.

751
00:29:03,211 --> 00:29:05,543
- Fired?
- Kidding.

752
00:29:08,786 --> 00:29:10,696
Uh, dude.

753
00:29:10,937 --> 00:29:13,324
I think it's been long enough.

754
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:16,255
I don't know.
I can still taste blood.

755
00:29:16,337 --> 00:29:17,559
Oh, it's nothing.

756
00:29:17,655 --> 00:29:20,254
All right, let's see here.

757
00:29:22,392 --> 00:29:24,442
Oh, it looks good, buddy.

758
00:29:24,967 --> 00:29:26,182
Oh. Whoa.

759
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:29,156
Page... Page ENT! Or Neuro!

760
00:29:29,238 --> 00:29:31,344
We need a Foley, packing, suction.

761
00:29:31,426 --> 00:29:33,096
I need an attending!

762
00:29:33,178 --> 00:29:34,808
All right, call a code.

763
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,221
What the hell's going on?

764
00:29:36,303 --> 00:29:38,314
- Uncontrolled posterior bleed.
- Yeah, I got that.

765
00:29:38,396 --> 00:29:39,943
Why the hell isn't this guy
already in an OR?

766
00:29:40,025 --> 00:29:41,418
- Ask him.
- All right, back off.

767
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:42,592
Back, back, back, back,
back, back, back, back.

768
00:29:42,674 --> 00:29:43,782
Let's go.

769
00:29:43,904 --> 00:29:46,323
We need to get him intubated,
open a central line kit,

770
00:29:46,405 --> 00:29:47,543
get some O neg here right away.

771
00:29:47,625 --> 00:29:49,326
You... what's his bleeding time?
Clotting factors?

772
00:29:49,408 --> 00:29:51,228
I-I don't remember. I-I was
juggling, like, five patients.

773
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:52,795
Did you even go to med school?
What are his labs?

774
00:29:52,877 --> 00:29:54,965
- Uh, I don't...
- Did you even do a physical exam?

775
00:29:55,047 --> 00:29:56,099
No labs were ever ordered.

776
00:29:56,181 --> 00:29:58,164
How long has this patient been here?
Bleeding in the ER?

777
00:29:58,246 --> 00:29:59,709
It's not my fault. H-He was fine.

778
00:29:59,791 --> 00:30:01,096
- How long?!
- Five hours.

779
00:30:01,178 --> 00:30:02,884
Yeah, I can't visualize.
I can't visualize anything.

780
00:30:02,966 --> 00:30:04,030
Get me a crike kit.

781
00:30:04,112 --> 00:30:06,491
And you... go put
the IR suite on standby.

782
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:10,381
You! Now! Go! Go!

783
00:30:13,465 --> 00:30:15,283
You gave alcohol to a patient

784
00:30:15,365 --> 00:30:17,105
under investigation by the police

785
00:30:17,187 --> 00:30:18,889
for reckless endangerment.

786
00:30:18,971 --> 00:30:20,955
Look, I offered it. He didn't take it.

787
00:30:21,037 --> 00:30:22,488
You know how many alcoholics I've met

788
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:23,707
who've passed on a drink?

789
00:30:23,789 --> 00:30:25,442
Then why is his blood alcohol
through the roof?

790
00:30:25,524 --> 00:30:26,693
Are you trying to lose your license?

791
00:30:26,775 --> 00:30:28,340
I was testing a theory.

792
00:30:28,422 --> 00:30:30,762
After I left his room, I ran some labs.

793
00:30:31,103 --> 00:30:33,412
He's got auto-brewery syndrome.

794
00:30:33,494 --> 00:30:35,042
It's incredibly rare.

795
00:30:35,124 --> 00:30:37,087
His GI tract contains a yeast

796
00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:39,910
that ferments any sugar he eats
and turns it into alcohol.

797
00:30:40,051 --> 00:30:41,702
It was probably the Jell-O.

798
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:43,909
- I've never heard of that.
- Yeah, that sounds made up.

799
00:30:43,991 --> 00:30:46,012
Well, maybe that's because
I've been around the block

800
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:48,242
a few times more than
either of you.

801
00:30:49,422 --> 00:30:51,989
Look, I replaced the vodka
with water, by the way.

802
00:30:52,071 --> 00:30:53,619
- I'm not an imbecile.
- Oh, you got lucky.

803
00:30:53,701 --> 00:30:56,330
No, I trusted my gut.
Now, that's not luck.

804
00:30:56,412 --> 00:30:59,425
Well, next time your gut talks
about one of my patients,

805
00:30:59,507 --> 00:31:01,822
have it talk to me first.

806
00:31:05,407 --> 00:31:07,940
I'm still not apologizing.
You acted like an ass.

807
00:31:08,022 --> 00:31:09,422
I was right.

808
00:31:09,617 --> 00:31:11,698
That's satisfaction enough.

809
00:31:13,096 --> 00:31:15,640
You've got to be kidding me.
What now?

810
00:31:17,289 --> 00:31:18,260
All right.

811
00:31:18,342 --> 00:31:19,958
Time for another round of epi.

812
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,636
No pulse with CPR.

813
00:31:21,767 --> 00:31:23,560
I can't get a readout on oximetry.

814
00:31:23,642 --> 00:31:24,629
What happened?

815
00:31:24,711 --> 00:31:26,357
Get in here. I could use
some help from a grown-up.

816
00:31:26,439 --> 00:31:27,980
We need to embolize
the spheno palatine artery.

817
00:31:28,062 --> 00:31:30,222
- All right, tell me what you need.
- Trying to access the femoral artery.

818
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:31,581
I got the right side.
You take the left.

819
00:31:31,663 --> 00:31:32,658
Got it.

820
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:33,778
What the hell happened?

821
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:35,198
Torrential posterior
nose bleed.

822
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,729
I tried to stabilize him
in the ER.

823
00:31:36,811 --> 00:31:38,802
Packing, Foley didn't work.
I got an IO line in,

824
00:31:38,884 --> 00:31:40,236
but the blood is barely
transfusing.

825
00:31:40,318 --> 00:31:41,834
- Damn it, I can't get in.
- Me neither.

826
00:31:41,916 --> 00:31:44,191
Vessels collapsed.
I'm gonna try a cutdown.

827
00:31:44,289 --> 00:31:45,964
All right, stop compressions.

828
00:31:47,733 --> 00:31:49,811
Without central access,
he's done.

829
00:31:52,152 --> 00:31:54,385
Hold off. Hold off.
Stop compressions.

830
00:31:54,467 --> 00:31:55,781
St...

831
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,965
Ugh. Call it.

832
00:31:59,047 --> 00:32:00,353
It was just a nosebleed.

833
00:32:00,435 --> 00:32:02,714
A nosebleed that brings
a person to the ER

834
00:32:02,796 --> 00:32:04,644
is never just a nosebleed.

835
00:32:04,914 --> 00:32:06,157
It was a mistake.

836
00:32:06,239 --> 00:32:08,103
It... It was just a mistake.

837
00:32:08,185 --> 00:32:09,578
I've got this.
You can go, Roy.

838
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:11,263
Not until Roy calls it.
His patient.

839
00:32:11,345 --> 00:32:12,310
No.

840
00:32:12,392 --> 00:32:13,866
- Roy.
- No! I'm just an intern!

841
00:32:13,948 --> 00:32:15,112
This isn't on me.

842
00:32:15,194 --> 00:32:16,343
Roy!

843
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:28,597
You're killin' it, Chief.

844
00:32:32,122 --> 00:32:34,933
Time of death... 17:57.

845
00:32:38,294 --> 00:32:40,519
So, what's it called again?

846
00:32:41,517 --> 00:32:43,592
Translumbar catheter.

847
00:32:43,674 --> 00:32:45,101
We just go in through the back

848
00:32:45,183 --> 00:32:47,174
and bypass all
of your fried central veins.

849
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:49,116
So, you saved my life again.

850
00:32:49,198 --> 00:32:51,245
Just... finding another way in.

851
00:32:51,327 --> 00:32:55,541
Well, if you can keep finding
new ways to do your job,

852
00:32:55,623 --> 00:32:56,867
so can I.

853
00:32:57,163 --> 00:32:59,073
No more questions.

854
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:02,090
But you are going
shopping, Dr. Grey.

855
00:33:02,172 --> 00:33:04,167
- Shopping?
- Most people love

856
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:06,347
to pour
their hearts out to me,

857
00:33:06,616 --> 00:33:08,573
but that's not you.

858
00:33:08,859 --> 00:33:11,425
So I can't start inside out.

859
00:33:11,507 --> 00:33:13,636
I've got to go outside in.

860
00:33:14,133 --> 00:33:19,266
I want you
to buy five great new outfits.

861
00:33:19,625 --> 00:33:21,230
Break the mold.

862
00:33:21,768 --> 00:33:23,253
Take chances.

863
00:33:23,372 --> 00:33:25,698
Make yourself ready
for something new.

864
00:33:25,894 --> 00:33:27,995
You do me... I do you.

865
00:33:29,829 --> 00:33:32,081
- That's the deal.
- Okay...

866
00:33:32,393 --> 00:33:34,003
I can come.

867
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:39,614
Just, uh, in case you need
an extra set of eyes.

868
00:33:39,696 --> 00:33:42,572
Or I can stay here
and monitor Cece.

869
00:33:42,676 --> 00:33:44,048
Do that.

870
00:33:50,275 --> 00:33:51,376
- Hey.
- Hey.

871
00:33:51,458 --> 00:33:52,845
Um...

872
00:33:53,289 --> 00:33:54,801
Kevin's all set in the PACU.

873
00:33:54,883 --> 00:33:56,446
His, uh, neurovascular checks look good.

874
00:33:56,528 --> 00:33:59,183
Good. Um, let me know
if anything changes.

875
00:33:59,265 --> 00:34:00,536
Yeah.

876
00:34:03,961 --> 00:34:06,989
Hey, um, you trying to
hook me up with Shepherd?

877
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:10,064
Oh, God, um...
that was a mistake.

878
00:34:10,146 --> 00:34:11,343
Um, um... I apologize.

879
00:34:11,425 --> 00:34:12,582
No, I'm not mad.

880
00:34:12,664 --> 00:34:14,774
I'm just surprised
you'd be into it.

881
00:34:14,856 --> 00:34:16,239
Me and your sister?

882
00:34:16,451 --> 00:34:17,871
With our history...

883
00:34:17,953 --> 00:34:19,349
Our history is ancient, Andrew,

884
00:34:19,431 --> 00:34:21,306
and it is the least
of my worries right now.

885
00:34:21,388 --> 00:34:24,020
Can you just keep an eye
on his vascular checks?

886
00:34:24,174 --> 00:34:25,596
Yeah.

887
00:34:29,376 --> 00:34:31,333
- Hey.
- Hey.

888
00:34:35,193 --> 00:34:36,945
Got to go shopping.

889
00:34:37,027 --> 00:34:38,321
Okay.

890
00:34:42,126 --> 00:34:44,909
Huh. Great.
There's showers in here.

891
00:34:44,991 --> 00:34:46,733
Fellows have a lounge on three.

892
00:34:46,829 --> 00:34:48,387
You kicking me out?

893
00:34:48,772 --> 00:34:50,118
No.

894
00:34:50,366 --> 00:34:51,915
Cool.

895
00:34:52,019 --> 00:34:53,377
Roy.

896
00:34:53,531 --> 00:34:55,006
No need to come in tomorrow.

897
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:56,302
Oh, thank you.

898
00:34:56,431 --> 00:34:58,505
I could really use... I'm
not giving you the day off.

899
00:34:58,587 --> 00:35:00,015
I'm giving you <i>every</i> day off.

900
00:35:00,097 --> 00:35:01,747
- You're fired.
- But Bailey...

901
00:35:01,829 --> 00:35:03,486
Bailey's not your boss anymore... I am.

902
00:35:03,568 --> 00:35:05,103
- It was a mistake.
- It wasn't a mistake.

903
00:35:05,185 --> 00:35:06,198
It was a lie.

904
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,920
You said
you'd taken care of the patient,

905
00:35:08,002 --> 00:35:08,925
and now a guy is dead.

906
00:35:09,007 --> 00:35:10,768
And you can't even take
responsibility for it.

907
00:35:10,850 --> 00:35:12,657
Which means, you're not cut out
for this line of work.

908
00:35:12,739 --> 00:35:14,821
- But...
- Save it, all right?

909
00:35:14,903 --> 00:35:16,109
This isn't where you defend yourself.

910
00:35:16,191 --> 00:35:17,317
This is where
you pack up your crap

911
00:35:17,399 --> 00:35:18,481
and you get the hell out of here.

912
00:35:18,563 --> 00:35:19,794
You are never setting hands

913
00:35:19,876 --> 00:35:21,233
on a patient in this hospital again.

914
00:35:21,315 --> 00:35:22,669
You got it?

915
00:35:37,071 --> 00:35:39,109
Oh, my God.

916
00:35:39,191 --> 00:35:42,139
- Oh, good. You got my stuff.
- Huh?

917
00:35:42,221 --> 00:35:44,362
I sent you that stuff
on electronic skin.

918
00:35:44,444 --> 00:35:46,346
I thought that's what
you were looking at.

919
00:35:46,428 --> 00:35:47,815
No, I'm looking at the budget.

920
00:35:47,897 --> 00:35:49,364
Where's Karev?

921
00:35:49,527 --> 00:35:51,336
Right here. You're looking at her.

922
00:35:51,418 --> 00:35:53,660
- I mean...
- No, no, no, I-I am the only Karev

923
00:35:53,742 --> 00:35:55,422
that you should be looking at.

924
00:35:55,729 --> 00:35:58,369
I'm the Karev who sold you
on the future of medicine,

925
00:35:58,451 --> 00:36:01,793
the crap that you funded
with your own... funds.

926
00:36:01,913 --> 00:36:03,565
We should be making magic,
and, instead,

927
00:36:03,647 --> 00:36:05,676
it's starting to feel like
a big mistake.

928
00:36:06,102 --> 00:36:08,605
A fellowship is a partnership,
Dr. Bailey,

929
00:36:08,687 --> 00:36:10,825
and you are not holding up
your end.

930
00:36:16,277 --> 00:36:18,496
It's not, is it?
It's not a partnership.

931
00:36:18,578 --> 00:36:21,958
You're still my boss.
And I just lost my fellowship.

932
00:36:22,167 --> 00:36:24,537
No, it is. You're right.

933
00:36:24,619 --> 00:36:26,251
I've been distracted.

934
00:36:26,333 --> 00:36:30,856
It has been a little hard
for me to let...

935
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:32,326
- Karev!
- Okay. Oh.

936
00:36:32,408 --> 00:36:33,605
What are you doing approving

937
00:36:33,687 --> 00:36:35,785
all of these requisition requests?

938
00:36:35,867 --> 00:36:37,847
Oh, making people happy.

939
00:36:37,929 --> 00:36:39,833
Where do you think
the money is coming from?

940
00:36:39,915 --> 00:36:43,417
You can't say "yes" to
everything that they ask for.

941
00:36:43,507 --> 00:36:44,785
You know, it turns out you can

942
00:36:44,867 --> 00:36:46,762
and still be under budget.

943
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:49,400
Look, even with these expenditures,

944
00:36:49,482 --> 00:36:51,934
I am under for the month.

945
00:36:52,471 --> 00:36:54,244
That's the quarter, not the month.

946
00:36:54,326 --> 00:36:55,321
Hmm?

947
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:57,407
What? W-Where do you see that?

948
00:36:57,489 --> 00:36:59,416
Here. Where is says "quarter."

949
00:37:00,049 --> 00:37:03,231
It says you spent
the entire <i>quarter's</i> budget

950
00:37:03,313 --> 00:37:04,688
- on your first day.
- Uh...

951
00:37:05,042 --> 00:37:06,342
Hey, I'm gonna...

952
00:37:06,424 --> 00:37:07,895
I'm gonna let you guys talk.

953
00:37:09,467 --> 00:37:10,567
I don't...

954
00:37:28,511 --> 00:37:30,040
Hey.

955
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:33,057
I'm sorry.

956
00:37:33,337 --> 00:37:35,200
I just saw Meredith.

957
00:37:36,516 --> 00:37:38,391
Jackson left without talking to you?

958
00:37:38,535 --> 00:37:39,958
He just left?

959
00:37:40,221 --> 00:37:41,969
I wish I could blame this on him,

960
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:44,973
but I told Link about you
before I even knew.

961
00:37:45,623 --> 00:37:47,453
Jackson left?

962
00:37:47,589 --> 00:37:49,837
And I was really kind of awful
to Owen.

963
00:37:49,919 --> 00:37:51,668
I was really...

964
00:37:52,537 --> 00:37:54,290
I was very awful to Owen.

965
00:38:02,435 --> 00:38:04,165
Jackson left.

966
00:38:08,068 --> 00:38:09,931
Uh, yeah, he...

967
00:38:10,114 --> 00:38:11,798
he said he needed to go
clear his head

968
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:15,212
or... unplug or whatever.

969
00:38:16,761 --> 00:38:18,344
He has some big questions.

970
00:38:18,426 --> 00:38:21,207
He needed some
big answers.

Oh, evening.

1002
00:39:43,149 --> 00:39:45,407
Your, uh...
Your wife still out of town?

1003
00:39:45,535 --> 00:39:48,582
Well, she has a few more

1004
00:39:48,664 --> 00:39:49,977

1005
00:39:50,095 --> 00:39:52,753
You know, first few days
as a bachelor are fun.

1006
00:39:52,835 --> 00:39:55,360
But... after that, it's boring.

1007
00:39:56,171 --> 00:39:57,557
I think I'll catch a movie or something.

1008
00:39:57,639 --> 00:39:59,059
Hey, I don't have anywhere to be.

1009
00:39:59,141 --> 00:40:02,516
That's nice, DeLuca,
but I don't need a babysitter.

1010
00:40:04,596 --> 00:40:06,813
- Long day.
- Hey.

1011
00:40:07,106 --> 00:40:08,681
Where do we drink around here?

1012
00:40:08,802 --> 00:40:11,626
Uh, there's, uh, Joe's pub
across the street.

1013
00:40:11,708 --> 00:40:13,688
- You know, underground.
- Yeah, I can show you.

You serious?

1019
00:40:27,198 --> 00:40:28,751
We went a couple rounds
over a patient.

1020
00:40:28,833 --> 00:40:30,036
Doesn't mean
we can't be friends.
