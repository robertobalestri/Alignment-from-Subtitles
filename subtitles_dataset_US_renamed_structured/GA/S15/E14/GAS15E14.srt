How long do you think
it'll take

11
00:00:28,608 --> 00:00:30,759
before I'm ready to do
a 24-hour surgery?

12
00:00:30,844 --> 00:00:33,299
I'm not sure that's
a healthy life goal, Qadri.

13
00:00:35,296 --> 00:00:36,405
Hey.

14
00:00:37,014 --> 00:00:38,089
What's going on?

15
00:00:38,174 --> 00:00:41,163
Mer's doing a pancreas-sparing
total duodenectomy

16
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:42,259
in a frozen abdomen.

17
00:00:42,344 --> 00:00:43,655
Oh. It got moved
from yesterday?

18
00:00:43,741 --> 00:00:45,398
No, she started it
yesterday.

19
00:00:45,514 --> 00:00:47,339
Five more hours, and she's gonna
break the hospital's record

20
00:00:47,424 --> 00:00:48,549
for the longest surgery.

21
00:00:48,634 --> 00:00:50,629
You think it's gonna take
five more hours?

22
00:00:50,714 --> 00:00:53,874
Well, I mean, with the adhesions
and the scar tissue,

23
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,272
it's taking her longer, so, yeah.
She can beat the record.

24
00:00:56,358 --> 00:00:58,089
- Feel a little better?
- No.

25
00:00:58,174 --> 00:01:00,608
I mean, yeah, she gets awards
and prizes and all that,

26
00:01:00,694 --> 00:01:01,929
but I get to be chief,

27
00:01:02,015 --> 00:01:03,358
so we're good.

28
00:01:03,584 --> 00:01:06,780
They make it in a lab and put
it in a pill for pain relief,

29
00:01:06,873 --> 00:01:09,741
giving you the high
your body creates naturally

30
00:01:09,884 --> 00:01:11,702
anytime you're doing
something you love.

31
00:01:12,924 --> 00:01:14,219
Helm.

32
00:01:14,507 --> 00:01:15,767
You want to tap out?

33
00:01:15,929 --> 00:01:16,929
No, thank you.

34
00:01:17,014 --> 00:01:19,366
- DeLuca?
- No, thank you. I'm good.

35
00:01:20,577 --> 00:01:22,219
<i>Oh! - Oh!</i>

36
00:01:22,343 --> 00:01:24,054
Think he could
use a break, though.

37
00:01:28,634 --> 00:01:30,179
When I said
"breakfast,"

38
00:01:30,264 --> 00:01:33,009
I meant more of a place
where we sit,

39
00:01:33,094 --> 00:01:36,929
someone takes our order,
there's less... lion jaws.

40
00:01:37,014 --> 00:01:40,358
No. Um...
pointed reduction clamp.

41
00:01:40,444 --> 00:01:43,647
I let interns assist on hip
replacements once they're prepared.

42
00:01:43,733 --> 00:01:45,839
I don't dish out
special favors.

43
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:47,594
At work.

44
00:01:50,134 --> 00:01:51,811
Neck osteotomy's done.

45
00:01:51,897 --> 00:01:53,273
Now we got to get into
the femoral canal.

46
00:01:53,358 --> 00:01:54,827
- What's the next step?
- Okay,

47
00:01:54,913 --> 00:01:56,969
first, I'll do a ream.

48
00:01:57,124 --> 00:01:59,089
And what would you use?

49
00:01:59,174 --> 00:02:01,991
I think
the Christmas Tree Reamer.

50
00:02:10,474 --> 00:02:13,077
Let's do actual breakfast
on Thursday.

51
00:02:13,432 --> 00:02:14,882
I'll make French toast.

52
00:02:21,514 --> 00:02:23,259
Why are you holding
toilet paper?

53
00:02:23,344 --> 00:02:25,468
It's the most important
camping supply.

54
00:02:26,289 --> 00:02:28,034
Oh, God.
Why's your face like that?

55
00:02:28,174 --> 00:02:29,327
I, uh...

56
00:02:29,413 --> 00:02:31,299
O-Our weekend away
is camping?

57
00:02:31,384 --> 00:02:33,969
Yeah. Babe, what did
you think Glen Rock was?

58
00:02:34,054 --> 00:02:35,897
"Sounds fancy,
but I deserve it"?

59
00:02:35,983 --> 00:02:37,492
I mean, of all the campsites
I went to,

60
00:02:37,577 --> 00:02:39,549
yeah, I guess it's the fanciest.
It did have running water.

61
00:02:39,634 --> 00:02:41,093
But no toilet paper,
so no...

62
00:02:41,179 --> 00:02:42,219
Toilets.

63
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:43,678
Okay, so, right.

64
00:02:43,764 --> 00:02:45,219
- Where do we go...
- packed a small shovel.

65
00:02:45,304 --> 00:02:47,351
And there are these really nice
rocks. They're great.

66
00:02:47,436 --> 00:02:50,179
You just kind of move over them,
kind of, as you...

67
00:02:50,944 --> 00:02:52,428
Look, it's camping,
babe.

68
00:02:52,514 --> 00:02:53,629
We're going camping.

69
00:02:53,714 --> 00:02:55,070
Are we, though?

70
00:02:55,155 --> 00:02:56,952
Ohh!
You're gonna love it!

71
00:03:01,532 --> 00:03:05,008
This is Tom Koracick?
The one who works here?

72
00:03:05,094 --> 00:03:07,391
I was surprised, too.
But it's, you know...

73
00:03:07,477 --> 00:03:10,014
I don't know.
It's new, and it's...

74
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:12,179
It's just kind of...
amazing.

75
00:03:12,264 --> 00:03:14,912
Look, I definitely
didn't expect to be dating

76
00:03:14,998 --> 00:03:18,092
at 30 weeks pregnant,
but he's kind and fun,

77
00:03:18,178 --> 00:03:20,233
and he's kinda wow.

78
00:03:20,342 --> 00:03:21,951
- Huh.
- I know.

79
00:03:22,357 --> 00:03:25,037
How about you
and Ben, now that he's back home?

80
00:03:25,142 --> 00:03:26,089
Watch out!

81
00:03:26,191 --> 00:03:27,549
Slow down!
This is a hospital!

82
00:03:27,675 --> 00:03:28,824
Get out!
Go, go, go!

83
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:29,894
- Oh, my...
- Go, go, go, go!

84
00:03:30,761 --> 00:03:32,183
Hey, Bailey,
pinpoint pupils!

85
00:03:32,269 --> 00:03:35,365
Yeah. Get some Narcan,
a crash cart, and some O2.

86
00:03:35,451 --> 00:03:37,011
I think
we got an OD.

you'd be in O.R. 3.

91
00:03:48,134 --> 00:03:49,469
I've been busy.

92
00:03:49,554 --> 00:03:52,242
This boy's buddies almost ran me
over in the ambulance bay.

93
00:03:52,328 --> 00:03:53,445
Tossed him
out of the car.

94
00:03:53,531 --> 00:03:54,836
Opioid overdose.

95
00:03:54,922 --> 00:03:56,889
Why? What's going on
in O.R. 3?

96
00:03:56,974 --> 00:03:58,929
Grey's been in surgery
since yesterday.

97
00:03:59,014 --> 00:04:00,516
Quite a crowd.

98
00:04:00,714 --> 00:04:02,129
Bailey,
we got two more.

99
00:04:02,214 --> 00:04:03,629
Two more overdoses?

100
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,937
Mm-hmm. Jerry and Paula.
Regulars.

101
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:07,799
Always shooting up
in the park down the street.

102
00:04:07,884 --> 00:04:09,389
They usually wake up
with one dose of Narcan

103
00:04:09,474 --> 00:04:10,523
and then
refuse treatment,

104
00:04:10,609 --> 00:04:12,165
but I've already given them
three doses,

105
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,164
and they're not
responding.

106
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:14,656
There's a bad batch of
something out there.

107
00:04:14,741 --> 00:04:16,235
- Okay.
- <i>Attention, all units.</i>

108
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,906
<i>We've reached
Code Red status.</i>

109
00:04:17,992 --> 00:04:20,640
<i>Any available unit, please
report to Meridien Park</i>

110
00:04:20,726 --> 00:04:22,460
<i>for multiple
suspected overdose events.</i>

111
00:04:22,546 --> 00:04:23,836
Looks like I'll be
seeing a lot of you today.

112
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:26,679
Okay, listen up.

113
00:04:26,764 --> 00:04:29,429
This is gonna be
an all-hands-on-deck situation.

114
00:04:29,515 --> 00:04:31,187
Let's page on-call personnel.

115
00:04:31,273 --> 00:04:33,820
Let's make sure that we got
all the Narcan from the pharmacy

116
00:04:33,906 --> 00:04:35,117
to reverse the opioids.

117
00:04:35,211 --> 00:04:37,562
We need to be prepared
for secondary injuries

118
00:04:37,648 --> 00:04:38,882
and side effects.

119
00:04:39,014 --> 00:04:40,929
Wait a minute.
Where are all my residents?

120
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:42,469
Uh, they're in Grey's gallery.

121
00:04:42,554 --> 00:04:43,898
I'll make sure
they get down here.

122
00:04:43,984 --> 00:04:45,796
- Okay.
- What about Hunt?

123
00:04:46,257 --> 00:04:47,799
Um, he's, uh...

124
00:04:49,726 --> 00:04:52,129
He's saying goodbye to Leo.
Betty's parents are taking him.

125
00:04:52,214 --> 00:04:53,485
Oh. Um...

126
00:04:53,571 --> 00:04:56,508
I'm sorry to hear about that,
but this is a mass OD.

127
00:04:57,554 --> 00:04:59,799
Yep. Okay.
We'll page him.

128
00:05:03,703 --> 00:05:05,469
Get your shoe on.

129
00:05:05,554 --> 00:05:07,219
Okay.
Get your shoe on.

130
00:05:07,304 --> 00:05:09,719
Your mom got this for him.
Do you want to keep it or...

131
00:05:09,805 --> 00:05:11,649
No, no.
That's his favorite.

132
00:05:14,976 --> 00:05:17,641
We were gonna... We were gonna
watch him grow up.

133
00:05:17,727 --> 00:05:19,165
We were gonna
teach him so many things.

134
00:05:22,304 --> 00:05:23,844
Well...

135
00:05:24,461 --> 00:05:25,836
Listen.

136
00:05:26,499 --> 00:05:28,233
I, um...

137
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:30,178
I hope you play soccer.

138
00:05:32,186 --> 00:05:33,389
I hope
you love your life.

139
00:05:33,474 --> 00:05:36,139
Wait, wait. Yours makes mine
sound shallow.

140
00:05:36,273 --> 00:05:37,959
Yeah. You should
probably go again.

141
00:05:38,045 --> 00:05:39,468
Yeah. Um...

142
00:05:39,554 --> 00:05:41,124
Listen.

143
00:05:46,069 --> 00:05:47,803
I'm always gonna be
rooting for you.

144
00:05:51,054 --> 00:05:51,970
Okay.

145
00:05:52,055 --> 00:05:53,089
Ready?

146
00:05:53,174 --> 00:05:54,799
No.

147
00:05:54,884 --> 00:05:57,089
But they're good people, Owen,
and they love him.

148
00:05:57,174 --> 00:05:58,514
He will be loved.

149
00:06:01,054 --> 00:06:02,304
Hey.

150
00:06:05,515 --> 00:06:06,694
Come in.

151
00:06:12,842 --> 00:06:15,339
So, uh... may I?

152
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:16,850
Oh. Uh, sorry.

153
00:06:16,936 --> 00:06:18,217
Yeah. Here.

154
00:06:19,694 --> 00:06:20,694
Hi!

155
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,339
Ohh!

156
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:24,265
When he gets fussy like that,
he's usually just hungry.

157
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:25,718
- We've raised one before.
- It's okay.

158
00:06:25,803 --> 00:06:27,509
Right.

159
00:06:27,594 --> 00:06:29,759
E.R. 911.
All hands on deck.

160
00:06:29,844 --> 00:06:33,089
So, we are, uh...
very grateful to you both.

161
00:06:33,174 --> 00:06:34,889
I have to go.
Owen...

162
00:06:34,974 --> 00:06:37,060
Listen, it's a massive
incoming trauma. I have to go.

163
00:06:39,264 --> 00:06:41,009
I'll just,
um...

164
00:06:42,342 --> 00:06:44,904
Do you want to feed him
while I finish packing him up?

165
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:45,920
Yeah,
that'd be great.

166
00:06:46,006 --> 00:06:47,537
Whoopsie!

167
00:06:47,859 --> 00:06:50,934
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Okay, everybody slow down.

168
00:06:51,066 --> 00:06:53,967
Speak to your team calmly,
get what they need, and handle it.

169
00:06:54,053 --> 00:06:56,223
With this many people,
communication is key.

170
00:06:56,309 --> 00:06:57,640
- What do you got?
- He was responding until

171
00:06:57,725 --> 00:07:00,326
about two minutes ago,
when he started hypoventilating again.

172
00:07:00,468 --> 00:07:02,303
Get him
on a Narcan drip.

173
00:07:02,474 --> 00:07:04,121
Bailey, how's it going?

174
00:07:04,974 --> 00:07:06,871
It's worse outside
than it is in here.

175
00:07:06,957 --> 00:07:08,219
And too many teenagers.

176
00:07:08,304 --> 00:07:10,259
I'm aware that I sound
like my mother,

177
00:07:10,344 --> 00:07:12,179
but is the world going to Hell
in a handbasket?

178
00:07:13,344 --> 00:07:14,839
Uh, 0.4 of Narcan.

179
00:07:14,924 --> 00:07:16,219
All right.
Bailey, you got this?

180
00:07:16,304 --> 00:07:17,505
I'm gonna go
to the ambulance bay

181
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:18,615
and see if I can get it
under control.

182
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:19,549
Teddy, I'll do it.

183
00:07:19,634 --> 00:07:20,887
Owen.
Look, I'm sorry.

184
00:07:20,973 --> 00:07:22,549
I-I wasn't
gonna page you, but...

185
00:07:22,634 --> 00:07:24,317
No, no, no.
Better here than at home.

186
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:25,554
Okay.

187
00:07:27,402 --> 00:07:28,426
Hey.

188
00:07:28,512 --> 00:07:30,317
People are dropping like flies
all over the park.

189
00:07:30,402 --> 00:07:32,271
Never seen anything like it.
How many ODs have been called in?

190
00:07:32,356 --> 00:07:34,146
50 and counting.

191
00:07:39,844 --> 00:07:41,219
Whoa.

192
00:07:57,296 --> 00:08:00,090
Hey, everybody! Listen up!
Here's how this is gonna go.

193
00:08:00,176 --> 00:08:01,824
Three ambulances
are gonna pull up.

194
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:04,176
When the patients are offloaded,
they're gonna pull out,

195
00:08:04,262 --> 00:08:05,583
and then the next three
are gonna come in.

196
00:08:05,668 --> 00:08:08,301
We're gonna set up
a triage area,

197
00:08:08,387 --> 00:08:10,339
where we're gonna assess
each ambulance

198
00:08:10,424 --> 00:08:12,566
and mark them
with the appropriate tag.

199
00:08:12,652 --> 00:08:15,317
Red tags get priority
for the E.R.

200
00:08:15,469 --> 00:08:17,764
Walking wounded will
be shown to the clinic,

201
00:08:17,904 --> 00:08:19,199
where they're gonna
be evaluated.

202
00:08:19,285 --> 00:08:20,089
Thank you.

203
00:08:20,174 --> 00:08:21,252
Thank you.

204
00:08:21,338 --> 00:08:22,377
Let's go.

205
00:08:23,818 --> 00:08:26,338
Helm, tell me
about the SMA first approach.

206
00:08:26,424 --> 00:08:27,871
You, uh, dissect out

207
00:08:27,957 --> 00:08:30,262
the entire
superior mesenteric artery

208
00:08:30,348 --> 00:08:33,676
to, uh, evaluate for any...
tumor invasion.

209
00:08:33,785 --> 00:08:35,012
Helm, are you in pain?

210
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:36,389
No.

211
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:37,707
I, uh...

212
00:08:38,038 --> 00:08:40,543
I just, uh, shouldn't have had
so much coffee.

213
00:08:40,632 --> 00:08:42,488
- Well, then go.
- No. I can hold it.

214
00:08:42,594 --> 00:08:44,402
If you can, I can.

215
00:08:45,589 --> 00:08:47,230
Did she have
her bladder stapled?

216
00:08:47,316 --> 00:08:48,629
That's not
the hard part...

217
00:08:48,715 --> 00:08:50,316
The achy legs,
the sore feet,

218
00:08:50,402 --> 00:08:51,929
the cramping back,
or the bladder.

219
00:08:52,014 --> 00:08:53,942
No, the hard part is that
this surgery doesn't get easier

220
00:08:54,027 --> 00:08:55,488
as it goes on...
It gets harder.

221
00:08:55,574 --> 00:08:58,028
And her eyes and her instincts
will need to be sharper

222
00:08:58,114 --> 00:09:00,676
when she finishes
than when she started.

223
00:09:01,034 --> 00:09:02,279
And that was yesterday.

224
00:09:02,364 --> 00:09:03,659
Do you think
she's part robot?

225
00:09:03,744 --> 00:09:05,293
I can hear you.

226
00:09:05,479 --> 00:09:07,104
I'm... so sorry.

227
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:09,198
Helm, just go.
Go update the family.

228
00:09:09,284 --> 00:09:10,621
Tell them
that he's doing great.

229
00:09:10,707 --> 00:09:12,645
And then go see
what you can do in the pit.

230
00:09:12,731 --> 00:09:14,324
Thank you!
Sorry. Thank you!

231
00:09:17,801 --> 00:09:20,199
Hey! Dr. Hays wants to know
if he can still do that surgery.

232
00:09:20,284 --> 00:09:22,279
Not if it's elective.
I want those O.R.s free.

233
00:09:22,364 --> 00:09:23,489
Have you ever seen
anything like this?

234
00:09:23,574 --> 00:09:24,535
No. And of course
it happens on a day

235
00:09:24,621 --> 00:09:26,448
that Mer sets
a new surgical record.

236
00:09:26,534 --> 00:09:27,949
I mean, I want to be there
to cheer her on.

237
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:29,418
She has DeLuca
to cheer her on.

238
00:09:29,774 --> 00:09:31,903
- Well, that's not a thing.
- Pretty sure that's a thing.

239
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:33,801
- Truman!
- Truman?

240
00:09:33,887 --> 00:09:35,957
- Ma'am, are you okay?
- My son... Truman.

241
00:09:36,043 --> 00:09:37,418
He's three years old...

242
00:09:37,504 --> 00:09:39,293
He has blond hair, he's wearing
a blue shirt,

243
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:40,319
- I think...
- All right, we'll call security...

244
00:09:40,404 --> 00:09:41,409
I talked
to the police.

245
00:09:41,494 --> 00:09:42,872
The police are
at the park, looking.

246
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:44,629
We were at the park,
playing,

247
00:09:44,715 --> 00:09:46,051
and suddenly
there were ambulances

248
00:09:46,137 --> 00:09:47,293
and police cars
everywhere,

249
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:48,529
and I went to see
what was going on,

250
00:09:48,614 --> 00:09:50,199
and then
when I turned around...

251
00:09:50,284 --> 00:09:51,333
Truman was gone,

252
00:09:51,418 --> 00:09:53,239
and then, uh...

253
00:09:53,324 --> 00:09:54,859
Anyway, the police
are looking in the park,

254
00:09:54,944 --> 00:09:56,060
and so I thought
I would come here

255
00:09:56,145 --> 00:09:57,271
and see if an ambulance person

256
00:09:57,356 --> 00:09:58,591
- or a fireman...
- What's your name?

257
00:09:58,676 --> 00:10:00,761
- Wendy.
- Wendy, look, we're gonna help you.

258
00:10:00,854 --> 00:10:02,574
- Jo, can you take her...
- I'll take her to security,

259
00:10:02,659 --> 00:10:03,872
see if he's here. Do you have
a picture of him?

260
00:10:03,957 --> 00:10:04,894
Yes. Yes.

261
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,481
Okay, I'll make sure
she has a tele bed

262
00:10:06,566 --> 00:10:08,159
to monitor
for arrhythmias.

263
00:10:08,244 --> 00:10:09,559
And I'll be out of town
this weekend,

264
00:10:09,644 --> 00:10:11,285
but I'll have Parker check
for her electrolytes

265
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:12,779
and cardiac markers,

266
00:10:12,864 --> 00:10:15,159
and you just, you know, call me
if you see anything unusual.

267
00:10:15,244 --> 00:10:15,990
All right.

268
00:10:16,075 --> 00:10:17,753
If calls can
even go through.

269
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:19,754
I might be
completely off the grid.

270
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:21,363
You going to the moon?

271
00:10:21,536 --> 00:10:22,741
I'm going camping.

272
00:10:22,857 --> 00:10:24,058
Why?

273
00:10:24,158 --> 00:10:26,378
'Cause Jackson loves camping
and I love Jackson.

274
00:10:26,464 --> 00:10:28,709
I love Ben, but I don't love
fantasy basketball.

275
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:30,003
Therefore,
I don't participate.

276
00:10:30,089 --> 00:10:32,745
I'm going camping, Bailey,
and I am going to like it.

277
00:10:33,438 --> 00:10:34,917
Are you, though?

278
00:10:38,284 --> 00:10:40,069
All right, Qadri,
so, we're definitely looking

279
00:10:40,154 --> 00:10:41,714
at a shooter's abscess.

280
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,512
I need to you make sure
he's got plenty of antibiotics

281
00:10:43,597 --> 00:10:45,132
and get a full washout
in the O.R.

282
00:10:45,589 --> 00:10:47,198
And look,
I know it smells bad,

283
00:10:47,284 --> 00:10:48,770
but breathe out of your mouth
or something

284
00:10:48,855 --> 00:10:50,824
so you don't look
so overtly disgusted.

285
00:10:53,259 --> 00:10:55,222
Mr. Frazier's prepped
for his hip replacement,

286
00:10:55,308 --> 00:10:57,690
and Schmitt's been crushing
the saw bones sessions,

287
00:10:57,792 --> 00:10:58,839
- so he'll assist.
- That's great,

288
00:10:58,924 --> 00:11:00,409
but Schmitt's
gonna have to wait.

289
00:11:00,626 --> 00:11:02,619
But his technique's flawless,
and I'll be there...

290
00:11:02,697 --> 00:11:04,892
I see the butterflies
floating around between you two,

291
00:11:04,978 --> 00:11:07,058
and that's cool, but try
to see past them long enough

292
00:11:07,154 --> 00:11:09,212
to notice the flood of patients
around you.

293
00:11:09,298 --> 00:11:10,858
I postponed
Mr. Frazier's surgery.

294
00:11:10,944 --> 00:11:12,159
It's all hands on deck
with trauma.

295
00:11:12,244 --> 00:11:14,908
- Got it.
- This unlucky lady not only OD'd,

296
00:11:14,994 --> 00:11:17,072
she broke both of her arms
when she fell.

297
00:11:17,158 --> 00:11:19,613
She needs to go to the O.R.
Schmitt can assist with that.

298
00:11:20,043 --> 00:11:21,838
And tell
the anesthesiologist

299
00:11:21,924 --> 00:11:23,314
she's had four doses
of Narcan.

300
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,267
Thank you so much, sir.
I won't let you down.

301
00:11:25,353 --> 00:11:26,665
I am ready and prepared
and...

302
00:11:26,751 --> 00:11:28,831
Show me,
don't tell me, Schmitt.

303
00:11:30,361 --> 00:11:31,726
Interns.
Am I right?

304
00:11:33,642 --> 00:11:34,967
No offense.

305
00:11:35,053 --> 00:11:36,533
None taken.

306
00:11:37,248 --> 00:11:38,423
Out of your mouth,
please.

307
00:11:45,873 --> 00:11:47,819
Apneic at the scene
with erratic rhythms...

308
00:11:47,905 --> 00:11:49,421
Last BP, 80 over 40.

309
00:11:49,507 --> 00:11:51,773
Got one patient responsive
after two doses of Narcan

310
00:11:51,859 --> 00:11:53,608
and another one
with decreased mentation

311
00:11:53,694 --> 00:11:54,741
but responsive
and talking.

312
00:11:56,046 --> 00:11:57,491
He lost his pulse.
Starting CPR.

313
00:11:57,577 --> 00:11:58,984
Helm, your two sound good
to go to the clinic,

314
00:11:59,069 --> 00:12:00,258
- but keep an eye on them.
- Yes, sir.

315
00:12:00,343 --> 00:12:01,884
Let's get them inside. Come on.

316
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,925
What's happening?

317
00:12:07,011 --> 00:12:08,077
Is s-she gonna be okay?

318
00:12:08,162 --> 00:12:09,219
Get these two
into the clinic.

319
00:12:09,304 --> 00:12:10,792
Is she... Betty!

320
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,249
Betty!

321
00:12:15,153 --> 00:12:16,761
Unh! 5-0.

322
00:12:17,003 --> 00:12:18,175
4-0.

323
00:12:28,231 --> 00:12:29,839
- What happened?
- You did it.

324
00:12:29,925 --> 00:12:31,604
No, I haven't finished
the anastomosis

325
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:33,069
or the lymphadenectomy.

326
00:12:33,154 --> 00:12:34,449
Suture scissors, Bokhee.

327
00:12:34,534 --> 00:12:35,722
Mered...

328
00:12:35,901 --> 00:12:38,158
Dr. Grey, you just beat
the hospital record

329
00:12:38,244 --> 00:12:39,542
for the longest
single surgery.

330
00:12:39,628 --> 00:12:41,847
Yeah.
I guess I did.

331
00:12:43,822 --> 00:12:45,067
Damn it.

332
00:12:45,324 --> 00:12:46,378
What?

333
00:12:46,489 --> 00:12:48,307
That just means that I'm gonna
want to break it again.

334
00:12:49,612 --> 00:12:52,107
Okay, let's get ready
with some lap pads.

335
00:12:52,373 --> 00:12:55,612
And, uh, Bokhee, someone should
update the family.

336
00:12:55,698 --> 00:12:57,714
Okay. I'm gonna tell them
their son's being saved

337
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,409
by a surgical legend.

338
00:12:59,494 --> 00:13:00,619
Okay, don't do that.

339
00:13:00,704 --> 00:13:01,949
Surgical superhero?

340
00:13:02,034 --> 00:13:03,448
No.
Wonder Woman?

341
00:13:03,597 --> 00:13:04,722
Yeah! Perfect.

342
00:13:05,948 --> 00:13:06,989
Thank you, Bokhee.

343
00:13:07,075 --> 00:13:08,239
Whoo!

344
00:13:08,518 --> 00:13:10,042
You are.

345
00:13:10,293 --> 00:13:12,886
Okay, now observe
the scaphoid carefully.

346
00:13:13,034 --> 00:13:14,628
What's the usual
point of entry?

347
00:13:14,714 --> 00:13:16,104
The distal pole.

348
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:18,620
But wait.
There's a humpback deformity.

349
00:13:18,706 --> 00:13:19,904
Exactly.

350
00:13:21,614 --> 00:13:22,823
Can you imagine...

351
00:13:22,909 --> 00:13:24,776
wanting something so badly

352
00:13:24,862 --> 00:13:27,690
that you'd be willing to
break both your arms to get it?

353
00:13:27,776 --> 00:13:29,620
Well, she didn't mean
to break her arms.

354
00:13:29,713 --> 00:13:30,784
Yeah, I know.
I'm just...

355
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:32,155
I broke
both my arms once.

356
00:13:32,324 --> 00:13:33,378
You did?

357
00:13:33,464 --> 00:13:35,768
Couldn't wipe my own butt
all summer. It was the worst.

358
00:13:36,205 --> 00:13:39,089
But the new X-Men comic
was coming out,

359
00:13:39,175 --> 00:13:40,620
and I had to have it.

360
00:13:40,706 --> 00:13:44,315
Like, had to be first in line
because, in my world,

361
00:13:44,401 --> 00:13:46,964
that was the only thing
worth bragging about.

362
00:13:47,221 --> 00:13:48,597
Fell off your bike?

363
00:13:48,759 --> 00:13:52,004
Flipped over the handlebars...
One block from the store.

364
00:13:52,324 --> 00:13:55,808
I got two months in casts,
three months of PT.

365
00:13:55,894 --> 00:13:58,858
And Robbie Freaking Krimefelt
got bragging rights.

366
00:13:58,944 --> 00:14:00,081
So yeah.

367
00:14:00,167 --> 00:14:04,082
I get wanting something so bad
you'd be willing to...

368
00:14:04,248 --> 00:14:06,323
Whoa. You just...

369
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:09,347
All right.

370
00:14:09,589 --> 00:14:10,917
She's all good.

371
00:14:11,025 --> 00:14:13,253
And with no hands to shoot up
for the next three months,

372
00:14:13,339 --> 00:14:15,339
hopefully, she'll actually
manage to detox.

373
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,035
<i>Dr. Mahoney to the E.R.</i>

374
00:14:19,284 --> 00:14:21,069
<i>Dr. Mahoney to the E.R.</i>

375
00:14:21,154 --> 00:14:22,237
Hey.

376
00:14:22,364 --> 00:14:23,569
Tell me
she found that kid.

377
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:25,261
No.
Security's on it.

378
00:14:25,352 --> 00:14:27,778
I'm worried about her.
Her BP's through the roof.

379
00:14:27,864 --> 00:14:29,119
She is so scared.

380
00:14:29,204 --> 00:14:30,859
<i>Excuse me.</i>

381
00:14:30,944 --> 00:14:33,917
I found him in the park...
Kind of shook up.

382
00:14:34,143 --> 00:14:35,558
Truman!

383
00:14:35,784 --> 00:14:37,276
I'm gonna...

384
00:14:37,481 --> 00:14:38,856
Mommy!

385
00:14:39,198 --> 00:14:40,323
Thank you.

386
00:14:40,409 --> 00:14:41,489
I saw him wandering,

387
00:14:41,574 --> 00:14:44,104
and I thought, well,
everybody's coming here.

388
00:14:44,472 --> 00:14:46,359
Uh... yeah.

389
00:14:46,444 --> 00:14:48,473
Let... Let us get you some food
and some shoes, maybe.

390
00:14:48,558 --> 00:14:49,815
No. Unh-unh.

391
00:14:49,901 --> 00:14:51,574
No, please. We got to
take a look at those feet.

392
00:14:51,659 --> 00:14:53,448
Uh, Qadri, could you help
this gentleman?

393
00:14:53,534 --> 00:14:54,744
Yeah.

394
00:14:56,954 --> 00:14:58,948
So, she's all right, then?
That lady?

395
00:14:59,034 --> 00:15:01,068
Oh, yeah. She's...
She's fine, thanks to you.

396
00:15:01,154 --> 00:15:02,279
She was scared
out of her mind.

397
00:15:02,364 --> 00:15:03,823
No, I mean
from the park.

398
00:15:03,938 --> 00:15:06,358
I saw her passed out
on the bench out there

399
00:15:06,444 --> 00:15:08,199
with the rest
of them junkies.

400
00:15:23,326 --> 00:15:24,621
I want to go.

401
00:15:24,707 --> 00:15:26,029
Can we go?
Can you get our clothes?

402
00:15:26,114 --> 00:15:28,152
Okay, yeah. Sure. I just...
I want to make sure

403
00:15:28,238 --> 00:15:29,388
- you're okay.
- I want to go.

404
00:15:29,473 --> 00:15:31,012
I don't want Amelia
to see me here.

405
00:15:31,098 --> 00:15:32,948
I-I don't want to put her
through that again.

406
00:15:33,034 --> 00:15:34,359
- O-Okay.
- Linus, please, can we...

407
00:15:35,994 --> 00:15:37,098
Hey. Hey!

408
00:15:37,223 --> 00:15:38,934
Hey! Help!
I need help!

409
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:40,659
Hey. It's okay.

410
00:15:40,887 --> 00:15:42,051
She was just talking.

411
00:15:42,177 --> 00:15:43,909
She wasn't complaining
of anything when she came in.

412
00:15:43,994 --> 00:15:44,918
Well,
she's complaining now.

413
00:15:45,004 --> 00:15:45,832
It hurts!

414
00:15:45,918 --> 00:15:47,318
What did she take?
I need to know.

415
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:48,566
Meth.

416
00:15:48,652 --> 00:15:50,489
We smoked some meth before
the batch of pills came 'round.

417
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:51,490
280 over 145.

418
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:52,739
Okay,
I need a gurney!

419
00:15:58,557 --> 00:15:59,682
Out of my way.

420
00:15:59,994 --> 00:16:01,230
Out of my way!

421
00:16:06,244 --> 00:16:08,027
I got a hypertensive
emergency here.

422
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:09,449
Took meth and opioids

423
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:10,926
and whatever
they were laced with.

424
00:16:11,012 --> 00:16:12,496
Clear a trauma room now!

425
00:16:18,805 --> 00:16:19,667
7-0 tube.

426
00:16:19,753 --> 00:16:22,393
Helm said she was stable when
she landed. This just happened.

427
00:16:22,591 --> 00:16:23,849
What's happening?
Is she okay?

428
00:16:23,934 --> 00:16:24,909
Who's that?
No idea. Boyfriend?

429
00:16:24,995 --> 00:16:26,130
Get him out of here.
I've got this.

430
00:16:26,215 --> 00:16:28,246
No! I need to be with Betty,
all right?

431
00:16:28,332 --> 00:16:29,896
I love her. I love her. Please.
Get him out of here!

432
00:16:29,981 --> 00:16:31,941
I need to be with her!
She's afraid to be alone!

433
00:16:32,027 --> 00:16:34,145
Dude, let me help you.
Let them help her.

434
00:16:34,207 --> 00:16:35,044
Go.

435
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:36,544
How can I help?
She needs to be ruled out

436
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:38,668
of multi-organ damage,
hypertensive ICH.

437
00:16:38,754 --> 00:16:39,830
I've started her
on a clevidipine drip.

438
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:41,488
Hunt,
you need to step away.

439
00:16:41,599 --> 00:16:42,824
We need that X-ray
in here now!

440
00:16:42,944 --> 00:16:44,066
Let me do this!

441
00:16:44,152 --> 00:16:46,027
Just... call Amelia.

442
00:16:46,158 --> 00:16:47,483
Tell her
that Betty's back.

443
00:16:47,569 --> 00:16:49,649
We don't need her to
flip her car trying to get here.

444
00:16:51,441 --> 00:16:52,840
Richard, please.

445
00:17:03,253 --> 00:17:04,746
I need to be
with Betty.

446
00:17:04,832 --> 00:17:06,708
No, you need hydration,
and we need to observe...

447
00:17:06,793 --> 00:17:08,278
One of the first nights
at rehab,

448
00:17:08,364 --> 00:17:09,983
Betty was telling me
what she's scared of.

449
00:17:10,068 --> 00:17:13,176
I-I-It was blood,
being home alone in the dark,

450
00:17:13,262 --> 00:17:14,965
falling into
a frozen lake,

451
00:17:15,051 --> 00:17:17,285
a-and she was scared
that for the rest of her life,

452
00:17:17,371 --> 00:17:18,371
she'd have to
tell people

453
00:17:18,457 --> 00:17:21,301
that her dealer
got her pregnant at 15.

454
00:17:21,557 --> 00:17:23,092
And who would
love her then?

455
00:17:23,231 --> 00:17:24,698
But I did.
All right?

456
00:17:24,784 --> 00:17:25,887
And I do.

457
00:17:25,973 --> 00:17:28,098
And I told her that one day,
we'd get a house

458
00:17:28,184 --> 00:17:30,069
and that we could
keep the lights on all the time

459
00:17:30,154 --> 00:17:31,441
and we'd be
nowhere near a lake

460
00:17:31,527 --> 00:17:33,822
and that no matter what,
I would love her.

461
00:17:33,908 --> 00:17:34,957
No matter what.

462
00:17:35,043 --> 00:17:36,272
You have to save her...
Please.

463
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:38,004
Betty's getting
the help she needs.

464
00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:42,309
I'll... get you an update
as soon as I can.

465
00:17:46,415 --> 00:17:49,090
Okay, Ralph,
I've paged a plastic surgeon

466
00:17:49,176 --> 00:17:50,653
to come take a look
at these skin lesions.

467
00:17:51,832 --> 00:17:54,598
I don't have any shoes,
but I'm getting plastic surgery.

468
00:17:55,965 --> 00:17:57,535
And I'll need
a urine sample.

469
00:17:57,621 --> 00:17:58,946
What for?

470
00:17:59,032 --> 00:18:00,947
We just need to run
a tox screen.

471
00:18:01,106 --> 00:18:02,651
Oh, that's unnecessary.

472
00:18:02,806 --> 00:18:05,801
I don't do drugs
or drink alcohol.

473
00:18:05,887 --> 00:18:07,613
I just make my home
in the park.

474
00:18:07,704 --> 00:18:08,996
I'm not like them.

475
00:18:09,387 --> 00:18:12,199
They're bringing down
the neighborhood, you ask me.

476
00:18:14,004 --> 00:18:16,895
Do you have... anywhere else
that you could stay?

477
00:18:16,981 --> 00:18:18,023
A temporary shelter?

478
00:18:18,109 --> 00:18:19,840
No. They got more people
than they got beds.

479
00:18:19,926 --> 00:18:22,211
They set a limit
on how many nights you can stay.

480
00:18:22,324 --> 00:18:24,184
I maxed out months ago.

481
00:18:24,971 --> 00:18:28,199
I never thought I'd be
calling a park bench my home,

482
00:18:28,454 --> 00:18:31,324
but rent control went out,
and I went out with it.

483
00:18:34,784 --> 00:18:35,934
Qadri,
what do we have?

484
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,066
This is Mr. Tennyson.

485
00:18:37,152 --> 00:18:39,377
He's got ulcerations and eschars
on the dorsums of his feet.

486
00:18:39,462 --> 00:18:42,551
Mr. Tennyson, this is Dr. Avery.
He's our head of plastics.

487
00:18:42,823 --> 00:18:44,762
You don't want to give me
a nose job, do you?

488
00:18:46,268 --> 00:18:48,004
No, sir.
Your nose is perfect.

489
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:50,277
I would like to take a look
at these feet, though.

490
00:18:52,572 --> 00:18:54,317
Qadri, face.

491
00:18:59,614 --> 00:19:01,441
She's got
a widened mediastinum,

492
00:19:01,535 --> 00:19:02,859
and with the meth
and opioids...

493
00:19:02,944 --> 00:19:04,450
You're worried
about an aortic dissection.

494
00:19:04,535 --> 00:19:05,779
Mm-hmm.

495
00:19:05,864 --> 00:19:07,779
It's a known
complication of meth.

496
00:19:07,864 --> 00:19:10,113
She's got
the classic signs.

497
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:14,739
Hey. Where is she?

498
00:19:14,824 --> 00:19:15,902
Amelia...

499
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,739
Well, is she hurt or just high?
Richard said...

500
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:19,044
Listen, I didn't want you
to panic,

501
00:19:19,129 --> 00:19:21,832
but we received some patients
from Meridien Park,

502
00:19:21,918 --> 00:19:23,069
and they all OD'd
from the same drug...

503
00:19:23,154 --> 00:19:25,066
She OD'd?
Is she okay?

504
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:26,309
You brought them here?

505
00:19:26,395 --> 00:19:27,988
They were still
at the house.

506
00:19:28,715 --> 00:19:30,379
That's Britney.
Britney?

507
00:19:30,465 --> 00:19:32,409
Oh, my God. What happened? Is
she hurt? I need to see her. Move.

508
00:19:32,494 --> 00:19:33,659
You can't go in there.
You can't go...

509
00:19:33,744 --> 00:19:34,909
Oh, my God.
You had to intubate her?

510
00:19:34,994 --> 00:19:36,091
You can't go in there
right now...

511
00:19:36,176 --> 00:19:36,949
That is our daughter!

512
00:19:37,034 --> 00:19:38,359
Yeah, and I'm her doctor,
okay? So...

513
00:19:38,444 --> 00:19:40,973
Okay, everyone calm down
and let Dr. Altman do her work.

514
00:19:41,059 --> 00:19:42,069
You too, Hunt.

515
00:19:42,154 --> 00:19:43,159
Okay, just tell us
what happened.

516
00:19:43,244 --> 00:19:45,496
She, uh, complained
about chest pain,

517
00:19:45,582 --> 00:19:48,037
and it looks like
she's had an aortic dissection.

518
00:19:48,123 --> 00:19:49,529
We're prepping her
for the O.R. right now.

519
00:19:49,614 --> 00:19:50,816
Surgery?

520
00:19:50,917 --> 00:19:52,911
We're gonna call Pierce,
we're gonna meet her there.

521
00:19:52,996 --> 00:19:54,833
- I'm gonna do it.
- No, no. You have an entire E.R...

522
00:19:54,918 --> 00:19:56,606
- Bailey can handle it.
- No. I'm gonna call Pierce...

523
00:19:56,691 --> 00:19:57,687
We don't have time
to wait for Pierce.

524
00:19:57,773 --> 00:19:59,309
Owen, let her do it.

525
00:20:00,058 --> 00:20:01,199
Okay.

526
00:20:01,285 --> 00:20:02,450
Well, I'm gonna go, too.

527
00:20:02,536 --> 00:20:04,895
Uh, Dr. Hunt, now,
you can help out in the pit,

528
00:20:04,981 --> 00:20:06,737
or you can sit in the chair
with the other parents,

529
00:20:06,822 --> 00:20:08,926
but you will not step one foot
in that O.R.

530
00:20:09,074 --> 00:20:10,909
All right, here we go.

531
00:20:10,994 --> 00:20:12,574
All right.
Watch the baby, please.

532
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:13,902
Here we come.

533
00:20:13,988 --> 00:20:15,637
Thank you.
Hold the elevator!

534
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:25,426
I don't understand
why you took him. He was fine.

535
00:20:25,574 --> 00:20:27,458
Because he was out of your sight
for a little while,

536
00:20:27,543 --> 00:20:28,677
so we just needed
to check him out.

537
00:20:28,762 --> 00:20:30,184
He'll be back soon.

538
00:20:30,341 --> 00:20:32,699
- You know, let me...
- let me take your blood pressure again.

539
00:20:32,784 --> 00:20:33,989
I'm fine!

540
00:20:34,074 --> 00:20:35,119
And so is he.

541
00:20:35,204 --> 00:20:36,859
We should
just be able to go.

542
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:38,191
Okay.

543
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:41,410
Stuart?

544
00:20:41,614 --> 00:20:43,137
Oh, my God!

545
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,613
Honey, they didn't need
to call you.

546
00:20:45,699 --> 00:20:47,184
We just had
a little scare.

547
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:49,598
Wendy, tell me
what the hell is going on.

548
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,465
I just...

549
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:54,409
Rita gave me some pills once,
from her back surgery,

550
00:20:54,494 --> 00:20:57,473
- just... to relax me.
- You were in the park to buy drugs?

551
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:00,480
You took Truman with you
to buy drugs?

552
00:21:01,239 --> 00:21:03,504
I couldn't leave him alone
in the car.

553
00:21:04,705 --> 00:21:07,530
Please, Stuart. I'm sorry.

554
00:21:07,904 --> 00:21:10,199
I love him.
I love him.

555
00:21:10,284 --> 00:21:12,691
I love him!
You have to forgive me!

556
00:21:12,852 --> 00:21:14,613
Can you take me
to my son, please?

557
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:16,309
Please.

558
00:21:32,145 --> 00:21:33,465
It's a lot, right?

559
00:21:33,551 --> 00:21:36,801
This is one of those days
where being a doctor is...

560
00:21:37,294 --> 00:21:39,504
It feels futile.

561
00:21:39,762 --> 00:21:40,977
It's, like,
we're in here

562
00:21:41,071 --> 00:21:43,324
doing our damnedest
to save lives, and out there,

563
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:45,529
people are just
killing themselves or each other

564
00:21:45,614 --> 00:21:48,230
faster than we can
possibly work, so...

565
00:21:48,754 --> 00:21:50,754
what's the point?

566
00:21:55,087 --> 00:21:56,473
Where would you go?

567
00:21:58,114 --> 00:22:00,409
If you just...
gave it all up?

568
00:22:00,494 --> 00:22:02,293
Um...

569
00:22:02,614 --> 00:22:03,981
You know, when it all
seems hopeless,

570
00:22:04,066 --> 00:22:08,020
what's... your secret
fantasy escape hatch?

571
00:22:11,864 --> 00:22:13,199
Went to Barbados once.

572
00:22:13,284 --> 00:22:17,254
It was... a bunch of expats...
Started a Blues bar.

573
00:22:17,861 --> 00:22:22,129
Tiny little shack
but incredible guitar players.

574
00:22:22,384 --> 00:22:25,589
Waves... rum... sand...

575
00:22:25,784 --> 00:22:27,207
quiet.

576
00:22:28,906 --> 00:22:30,223
You?

577
00:22:32,675 --> 00:22:34,760
Right now,
that sounds...

578
00:22:35,043 --> 00:22:36,409
pretty great, actually.

579
00:22:40,498 --> 00:22:41,926
What the...

580
00:22:42,784 --> 00:22:43,904
What's...

581
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:46,385
Oh, my God.
Son of a bitch!

582
00:22:46,471 --> 00:22:47,471
Oh, my God.

583
00:22:47,614 --> 00:22:48,530
Oh, my God, no.

584
00:22:48,615 --> 00:22:49,819
Here.

585
00:22:49,904 --> 00:22:51,409
Got to get down here.

586
00:22:57,462 --> 00:22:59,327
I came
as soon as I heard...

587
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:00,590
Type B dissection?

588
00:23:00,676 --> 00:23:03,381
I'm gonna do an endovascular
stent of the descending aorta.

589
00:23:03,503 --> 00:23:04,798
Webber's on his way up
to join.

590
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,121
Thank you. I know you've been
swamped down in the pit.

591
00:23:07,207 --> 00:23:08,223
I can take it from here.

592
00:23:08,326 --> 00:23:10,012
- No.
- No?

593
00:23:10,098 --> 00:23:12,803
She's so pale, I can see
every capillary under her skin.

594
00:23:12,973 --> 00:23:16,121
That dissection could
cause her aorta to rupture.

595
00:23:16,831 --> 00:23:20,012
You know as well I do
that Amelia may never see

596
00:23:20,098 --> 00:23:21,590
that little girl
open her eyes again.

597
00:23:21,676 --> 00:23:23,721
Teddy...
And if that happens,

598
00:23:23,807 --> 00:23:26,176
let me be the surgeon
to tell Amelia that we lost her.

599
00:23:26,284 --> 00:23:28,270
Because she's gonna need
her sister.

600
00:23:45,051 --> 00:23:47,973
You are so close.

601
00:23:48,143 --> 00:23:49,714
Tell me something.

602
00:23:49,904 --> 00:23:51,621
Okay. What?

603
00:23:51,909 --> 00:23:53,068
Just anything.

604
00:23:53,154 --> 00:23:54,359
Because all I can
think about right now

605
00:23:54,444 --> 00:23:56,199
is how much
my feet and my legs hurt,

606
00:23:56,284 --> 00:23:58,239
so if you tell me something,
I can think about that instead.

607
00:23:58,324 --> 00:24:00,020
Um, okay.

608
00:24:00,106 --> 00:24:03,770
Uh, when I was seven years old,
I broke a world record.

609
00:24:04,884 --> 00:24:06,629
For what?

610
00:24:06,715 --> 00:24:09,550
Most times a minor rode
a roller coaster in one day.

611
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:12,093
Really? How many times
did you ride it?

612
00:24:12,194 --> 00:24:13,395
12.

613
00:24:14,594 --> 00:24:17,004
I-I didn't really break
a world record,

614
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:18,669
but for several years,
I believed that I did.

615
00:24:22,494 --> 00:24:24,840

And I think
it didn't occur to me

619
00:24:31,364 --> 00:24:33,279
because you're also
a work of art.

620
00:24:34,675 --> 00:24:35,970
Physically.

621
00:24:36,125 --> 00:24:38,516
Like a statue in Rome.

622
00:24:38,649 --> 00:24:40,774
And
when I look at you,

623
00:24:40,961 --> 00:24:43,751
surgery isn't
what springs to mind.

624
00:24:44,574 --> 00:24:45,909

Couldn't get him back.

635
00:25:20,923 --> 00:25:21,946
He was my patient.

636
00:25:22,032 --> 00:25:24,727
I left him sitting in a bed
with an IV in his arm.

637
00:25:24,813 --> 00:25:26,352
Perfectly healthy kid.

638
00:25:30,628 --> 00:25:32,321
Dr. Shepherd?

639
00:25:33,765 --> 00:25:35,384
Are you okay?

640
00:25:37,128 --> 00:25:40,293
Do you want to take a break,
take a walk?

641
00:25:40,447 --> 00:25:41,931
I knew him.

642
00:25:42,774 --> 00:25:44,563
That kid.

643
00:25:45,008 --> 00:25:46,587
He was, uh...

644
00:25:48,378 --> 00:25:50,253
He was a good kid.

645
00:25:50,534 --> 00:25:52,368
He wasn't a bad kid.

646
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:57,766
I'm gonna have to
call his parents.

647
00:25:59,495 --> 00:26:01,095
I can take care
of that.

648
00:26:01,181 --> 00:26:02,181
No.

649
00:26:03,614 --> 00:26:05,034
No, I'm...

650
00:26:05,995 --> 00:26:07,342
Thank you.

651
00:26:23,249 --> 00:26:24,449
I'm so sorry.

652
00:26:24,534 --> 00:26:25,960
It's... It's okay.

653
00:26:26,117 --> 00:26:27,514
I'm so sorry.

654
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:37,202
Great work, Qadri.

655
00:26:37,288 --> 00:26:40,493
You want to cut away
all that dead tissue

656
00:26:40,654 --> 00:26:42,561
till we find
healthy bleeding.

657
00:26:42,658 --> 00:26:43,663
Almost done.

658
00:26:43,784 --> 00:26:44,874
So I get to keep 'em?

659
00:26:45,004 --> 00:26:46,342
You do
get to keep them.

660
00:26:50,925 --> 00:26:52,413
Can I talk to you?

661
00:26:52,810 --> 00:26:53,935
Yeah, of course.

662
00:26:55,207 --> 00:26:56,922
I can't go camping
this weekend.

663
00:26:57,008 --> 00:26:58,254
Babe, see,
the thing is you think

664
00:26:58,339 --> 00:26:59,908
you can't go camping
this weekend, okay?

665
00:26:59,994 --> 00:27:01,029
But once
we get out there,

666
00:27:01,114 --> 00:27:02,203
you're gonna find it
breathtaking.

667
00:27:02,288 --> 00:27:05,118
And you will realize all the
things we don't need in life...

668
00:27:05,204 --> 00:27:06,717
Just how much
we don't need, okay?

669
00:27:06,803 --> 00:27:08,509
When you're sitting there
by a fire crackling,

670
00:27:08,594 --> 00:27:10,429
one bowl, one spoon,
you realize

671
00:27:10,515 --> 00:27:13,013
we don't need...
three pairs of ski boots.

672
00:27:13,099 --> 00:27:14,138
You know?

673
00:27:14,224 --> 00:27:15,949
Y... No. And don't... don't
tell me that you don't ski.

674
00:27:16,034 --> 00:27:17,819
I know you don't ski,
because it's outdoors,

675
00:27:17,904 --> 00:27:19,449
but that's probably
because your parents

676
00:27:19,534 --> 00:27:21,949
didn't take you outdoors,
but when I do, you will see.

677
00:27:22,034 --> 00:27:24,449
Okay? Just let me show you,
please? Okay?

678
00:27:24,534 --> 00:27:25,739
Okay.
Backing up...

679
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:26,615
Mm-hmm.

680
00:27:26,701 --> 00:27:28,156
Betty is
in the hospital.

681
00:27:28,245 --> 00:27:29,740
She OD'd.

682
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:32,225
Amelia's gonna need help,
so...

683
00:27:32,311 --> 00:27:34,178
So you cannot go camping
this weekend.

684
00:27:34,264 --> 00:27:36,059
My bad.

685
00:27:36,173 --> 00:27:37,798
I'm sorry.

686
00:27:37,898 --> 00:27:39,558
You should still go,
though.

687
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:44,381
Aw. That's too bad.

688
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:47,161
Ah, it's okay.

689
00:27:47,371 --> 00:27:49,153
Next time.

690
00:27:50,441 --> 00:27:54,200
Okay, so, we're
almost finished here.

691
00:27:54,404 --> 00:27:55,833
I'll get you
bandaged up.

692
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:57,965
It's important that you keep
this clean and dry, okay?

693
00:27:58,050 --> 00:27:59,247
That'll be tricky.

694
00:27:59,333 --> 00:28:01,013
Ralph lives in the park.

695
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:02,989
He brought in
a little missing boy today.

696
00:28:03,075 --> 00:28:04,280
Oh.

697
00:28:04,614 --> 00:28:05,819
The park.

698
00:28:05,904 --> 00:28:08,474
Okay, I hadn't...
realized that.

699
00:28:08,744 --> 00:28:10,075
It's okay.

700
00:28:10,348 --> 00:28:13,105
Makes you realize
all the things you don't need.

701
00:28:15,832 --> 00:28:17,527
<i>Dr. Teller to the E.R.</i>

702
00:28:17,621 --> 00:28:20,416
<i>Dr. Teller to the E.R.</i>

703
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:21,808
Mr. Cole.

704
00:28:21,894 --> 00:28:24,425
The police have taken your wife
into custody and...

705
00:28:24,574 --> 00:28:26,355
Good.
The police can have her.

706
00:28:26,944 --> 00:28:30,214
Sir, your wife has a problem.
She needs treatment.

707
00:28:30,401 --> 00:28:31,856
She needs that
more than punishment.

708
00:28:31,942 --> 00:28:33,012
I don't know
what I can do for her.

709
00:28:33,097 --> 00:28:35,012
No, you're right.
Don't worry about her.

710
00:28:35,098 --> 00:28:36,401
Worry about him.

711
00:28:36,613 --> 00:28:39,128
And no matter what she says,
you don't just forgive her.

712
00:28:39,214 --> 00:28:41,379
You don't let her near him
until you know she's clean.

713
00:28:41,614 --> 00:28:44,378
Yes, get her treatment,
but protect your kid.

714
00:28:44,847 --> 00:28:46,065
You got me?

715
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:47,825
Protect your kid.

716
00:28:53,618 --> 00:28:55,552
Okay, let's shoot the angio.

717
00:28:56,161 --> 00:28:59,416
No endoleaks, stent-grafts
are well-approximated.

718
00:28:59,502 --> 00:29:01,247
Aortic arch is clear.

719
00:29:01,339 --> 00:29:02,714
There's no flow
from the celiac.

720
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,325
Let's shoot
from the femoral.

721
00:29:05,207 --> 00:29:06,591
Dye.

722
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,885
Higher concentration
of dye.

723
00:29:15,056 --> 00:29:17,021
God, I hate
that she did this to herself.

724
00:29:17,107 --> 00:29:19,263
That's addiction...
The thing that's killing you

725
00:29:19,349 --> 00:29:22,778
keeps whispering in your ear
that you need it to survive.

726
00:29:23,847 --> 00:29:25,364
There's no flow
from either end.

727
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:27,445
Her distal aorta
is blocked.

728
00:29:27,654 --> 00:29:29,199
Which means
there's no blood flow

729
00:29:29,284 --> 00:29:30,466
to the distal
extremities.

730
00:29:30,552 --> 00:29:31,521
Damn it! Damn it!

731
00:29:31,607 --> 00:29:33,303
Altman, if there's
any extraordinary measures

732
00:29:33,388 --> 00:29:36,044
you can use here,
please use them now.

733
00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:37,693
Okay.
Take everything out.

734
00:29:37,779 --> 00:29:38,984
We're gonna have to
open her up

735
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:41,544
and reconstruct
her distal aorta completely

736
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:42,701
if we're gonna
save her life.

737
00:29:42,786 --> 00:29:43,791
Let me have a pad.

738
00:29:43,877 --> 00:29:45,462
All right,
let's prep her abdomen!

739
00:29:45,704 --> 00:29:47,060
Let's go. Come on.

740
00:29:47,146 --> 00:29:48,911
Come on, Betty.
Come on.

741
00:29:56,016 --> 00:29:58,169
I can't even stand
to look at you.

742
00:30:00,904 --> 00:30:04,074
That's the last thing I said
to her before she disappeared.

743
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:09,255
"I can't even stand
to look at you."

744
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,365
Now...

745
00:30:20,842 --> 00:30:22,892
Tell us
that she's gonna be okay.

746
00:30:24,411 --> 00:30:26,153
I mean, you're doctors.
Just...

747
00:30:28,284 --> 00:30:30,466
tell us that she's gonna
get through this.

748
00:30:32,165 --> 00:30:33,474
I wish I could.

749
00:30:35,802 --> 00:30:37,972

about how we

831
00:34:06,668 --> 00:34:08,583
can't decide whether we should
stay inside or outside,

832
00:34:08,668 --> 00:34:09,731

And I spent all day
debriding his feet,

836
00:34:14,723 --> 00:34:16,819
and there's no way he can
maintain a follow-up protocol

00:34:16,904 --> 00:34:18,069
on a park bench.

838
00:34:19,441 --> 00:34:21,397

854
00:35:04,613 --> 00:35:06,691

it saved my life.

00:36:17,996 --> 00:36:20,060
It's not much, but it's enough
to keep you warm and dry

875
00:36:20,145 --> 00:36:21,985
till you get off the waitlist
for a real place.

876
00:36:22,418 --> 00:36:25,332
Dry socks here, long underwear,
lightweight tent,

877
00:36:25,418 --> 00:36:27,449
a sleeping bag,
a couple raincoats,

878
00:36:27,535 --> 00:36:28,908
and a pair of shoes for you

879
00:36:28,994 --> 00:36:30,138
once the swelling goes down
a bit.

880
00:36:30,223 --> 00:36:33,872
You had all this...
just in the trunk of your car?

881
00:36:36,594 --> 00:36:37,634
Yeah.

882
00:36:38,792 --> 00:36:40,348
Yeah, I did.

884
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:54,769
You were left
in a park, right?

885
00:36:55,089 --> 00:36:56,715
When you were three.

886
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:58,965
By your junkie dad.

887
00:37:00,672 --> 00:37:02,358
Bar parking lot.

888
00:37:02,503 --> 00:37:04,528
And I was six.

889
00:37:05,324 --> 00:37:06,739
I wish I'd been three.

890
00:37:06,824 --> 00:37:10,004
Then I wouldn't have remembered
that he left me there.

891
00:37:15,889 --> 00:37:17,514
Jo, it's too late
for coffee.

892
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,019
It's hot chocolate.

893
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:21,137

894
00:37:21,223 --> 00:37:22,262
Oh.

895
00:37:22,411 --> 00:37:23,826

896
00:37:30,002 --> 00:37:31,837
Mmm.
Yeah, that's good.

897
00:37:31,923 --> 00:37:33,663
