16
00:00:44,571 --> 00:00:46,711

She'd better love it.

God knows she gave me
enough stipulations.

Let's go.
T... Oh.

50
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:58,030
Do you need a ride
to your own party?

51
00:01:58,131 --> 00:01:59,171
It's Jackson's party.

52
00:01:59,256 --> 00:02:00,561
And, no,
I don't need a ride.

53
00:02:00,647 --> 00:02:03,241
What I need is a drink
to help calm my nerves...

54
00:02:03,366 --> 00:02:05,241
...before I have
to go and pretend to like it.

55
00:02:05,326 --> 00:02:07,162
A friend would help.

56
00:02:07,272 --> 00:02:08,506
What?

57
00:02:08,626 --> 00:02:11,051
Okay, I have been
sternly warned,

58
00:02:11,136 --> 00:02:14,131
by more than one person,
not to aid and abet in any way,

59
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:15,483
should you try to ditch.

60
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:17,850
Well, I was offering you
a ride in my limousine,

61
00:02:17,936 --> 00:02:19,561
that has a fully
stocked bar.

62
00:02:19,646 --> 00:02:21,576
But enjoy going
in your own car,

63
00:02:21,662 --> 00:02:23,522
that you have to drive
yourself.

64
00:02:23,733 --> 00:02:26,001
You should have led
with limo.

65
00:02:30,287 --> 00:02:32,071
So, I'm not sure
where it's going,

66
00:02:32,156 --> 00:02:34,428
um
if it's even going anywhere.

67
00:02:34,514 --> 00:02:37,295
But seeing how half of my
co-workers will be at the party

68
00:02:37,381 --> 00:02:40,475
and see us together,
I am doing the responsible thing

69
00:02:40,561 --> 00:02:43,248
and letting you know that
Andrew DeLuca and I are dating.

70
00:02:47,732 --> 00:02:49,608
Well?
Are you telling me this

71
00:02:49,694 --> 00:02:51,021
as the chief
or as your friend?

72
00:02:51,106 --> 00:02:53,147
I don't know.
Both. Why?

73
00:02:53,233 --> 00:02:55,218
Because I want to know
if I need to explain hospital rules

74
00:02:55,303 --> 00:02:56,983
or just laugh at you.

75
00:02:58,358 --> 00:03:00,030
When is Bailey
getting her job back?

76
00:03:00,131 --> 00:03:01,795
Oh, why?
Would you rather tell her?

77
00:03:01,881 --> 00:03:03,186
Can I watch?

78
00:03:03,272 --> 00:03:04,780
You know,
you married a resident,

79
00:03:04,881 --> 00:03:06,071
and I didn't say anything.

80
00:03:06,156 --> 00:03:07,272
Yes, you did.

81
00:03:07,358 --> 00:03:09,514
You were mean to her
for like two years.

82
00:03:09,678 --> 00:03:11,873
And by the time I married her,
she was a fellow.

83
00:03:12,022 --> 00:03:13,280
Well, you put my
resident

84
00:03:13,366 --> 00:03:14,749
- in the hospital.
- Okay, we can stop.

85
00:03:14,834 --> 00:03:16,701
But as chief,
I need to tell you

86
00:03:16,787 --> 00:03:18,787
to report your relationship
to HR.

87
00:03:18,873 --> 00:03:21,968
As your friend,
I hope he makes you happy.

88
00:03:22,281 --> 00:03:23,606
Thank you.

89
00:03:26,476 --> 00:03:28,351
<i>Dr. Lawrence to the NICU.</i>

90
00:03:28,437 --> 00:03:30,648
<i>Dr. Lawrence to the NICU.</i>

91
00:03:31,117 --> 00:03:32,828
Chief, Mrs. Karev
wants to see you.

92
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:34,266
All right, tell her
I'll see her at the party.

93
00:03:34,351 --> 00:03:36,031
And it's<i> Dr.</i> Karev, Helm.

94
00:03:36,116 --> 00:03:38,789
Oh. Right. Sorry.

95
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:41,499
He said he'll meet you
at the party.

96
00:03:42,796 --> 00:03:43,971
Oh.

97
00:03:46,405 --> 00:03:48,390
<i>Dr. Millicent, call Radiolog.</i>

98
00:03:48,476 --> 00:03:50,551
<i>Dr. Millicent, call Radiology.</i>

99
00:03:56,734 --> 00:03:58,757
That's it.

100
00:03:58,976 --> 00:04:01,335
Easy.
It's only been two weeks.

101
00:04:01,421 --> 00:04:03,367
I can get this.
Or you could not.

102
00:04:03,453 --> 00:04:04,468
I could stay.

103
00:04:04,554 --> 00:04:06,195
Betty, you can do this.
How?

104
00:04:06,359 --> 00:04:09,931
I'm a drug addict with a baby
and a dead boyfriend.

105
00:04:10,046 --> 00:04:12,523
I have nothing in common
with anyone my age,

106
00:04:12,609 --> 00:04:15,015
and they're all gonna look at me
like I'm some sort of freak.

107
00:04:15,117 --> 00:04:16,671
Because that's what I am.

108
00:04:17,062 --> 00:04:18,171
I ruined my life.

109
00:04:18,257 --> 00:04:19,511
That was the drugs.

110
00:04:19,648 --> 00:04:21,843
And they tried to ruin
your life, but they failed.

111
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:23,320
Because you are here.

112
00:04:23,406 --> 00:04:24,651
And I am here,

113
00:04:24,736 --> 00:04:26,976
and I am here for you
no matter where you live.

114
00:04:27,062 --> 00:04:29,890
And you are gonna call me
anytime you need to.

115
00:04:29,976 --> 00:04:32,554
Day or night.
You are not in this alone.

116
00:04:33,484 --> 00:04:34,867
It is gonna get better,
Betty.

117
00:04:34,953 --> 00:04:38,140
I promise you
it gets so much better.

118
00:04:39,086 --> 00:04:41,437
Can't we just stay another
night, John?

119
00:04:41,523 --> 00:04:42,914
And get stuck
in morning traffic.

120
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,031
Yeah. But... But it's
4 1/2 hours'

121
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:47,046
difference... The difference
that's gonna make.

122
00:04:47,132 --> 00:04:48,953
I mean, it's... it's crazy.

123
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:50,703
Well...
Uh, uh...

124
00:04:50,789 --> 00:04:52,757
Sorry, sorry. Uh, just...

125
00:04:53,109 --> 00:04:56,038
Babies are a lot more work
than I remember.

126
00:04:58,964 --> 00:05:01,564
Well, uh...

127
00:05:05,648 --> 00:05:07,203
God, you're so weird.

128
00:05:14,664 --> 00:05:17,125
Well, uh,
thank you both.

129
00:05:18,156 --> 00:05:19,828
So much.

130
00:05:20,193 --> 00:05:21,838
For everything.

131
00:05:34,336 --> 00:05:36,062
She didn't say goodbye.

132
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,691
I'm gonna go get ready.

133
00:05:43,148 --> 00:05:44,843
You're going
to the party?

134
00:05:45,076 --> 00:05:47,828
Yeah, I, uh, can't be
in this house tonight.

135
00:05:52,531 --> 00:05:54,195
Hey, hey.
Hey, hey.

136
00:05:54,281 --> 00:05:56,015
Oh. You know the party's
catered, right?

137
00:05:56,101 --> 00:05:57,726
Well, it's rude not
to bring anything.

138
00:05:57,843 --> 00:06:00,078
Hey!

139
00:06:00,179 --> 00:06:01,866
I rest my case.

140
00:06:02,617 --> 00:06:03,718
Hey, Pierce!

141
00:06:03,804 --> 00:06:05,343
Hi... Uh, nothing.

142
00:06:05,429 --> 00:06:06,671
Hi, I mean.

143
00:06:06,757 --> 00:06:08,031
- Did you see it?
- What?

144
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:10,101
What? That lady you hated
wrote an article about you.

145
00:06:10,186 --> 00:06:11,272
I'll text it to all of you.

146
00:06:11,366 --> 00:06:12,680
- Oh, what lady?
- Kiki?

147
00:06:12,765 --> 00:06:15,291
- What kind of article?
- Uh, who is this person?

148
00:06:15,376 --> 00:06:18,210
"How Bravery and Self-Advocacy
Saved My Life."

149
00:06:18,296 --> 00:06:20,061
Oh, that sounds nice.

150
00:06:20,367 --> 00:06:21,601
That bitch.

151
00:06:21,686 --> 00:06:22,801
Why? What'd she say?

152
00:06:22,886 --> 00:06:24,765
Shh, shh, shh.
I'm reading.

153
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:26,601
I thought you gave
all your money away.

154
00:06:26,687 --> 00:06:28,771
I could fit my whole loft
inside your fireplace.

155
00:06:28,856 --> 00:06:30,523
That's not how it works.

156
00:06:30,609 --> 00:06:32,484
Um, I created
a restricted endowment

157
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:33,828
invested
in a diverse portfolio

158
00:06:33,914 --> 00:06:36,156
for my mom's foundation
to handle all the payouts.

159
00:06:36,242 --> 00:06:38,081
Oh, you have ping-pong.

160
00:06:39,406 --> 00:06:40,774
So, you got the whole place
to yourself, huh?

161
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:42,624
Yes. No sisters, no kids.

162
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:44,734
First time
in recent memory.

163
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,720
Do we have to go
to this party?

164
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:50,831
Yes.

165
00:06:51,007 --> 00:06:52,648
But we don't
have to stay long.

166
00:06:53,414 --> 00:06:54,731
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

167
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:01,929
- Okay, good to go.
- Okay.

168
00:07:02,835 --> 00:07:06,171
There is an MRI pending
for Mr. Evans in ICU 4.

169
00:07:06,257 --> 00:07:08,188
And can you check all the labs
for the 11:00 p.m. draw

170
00:07:08,273 --> 00:07:10,609
and get back to me if there's
anything I should know?

171
00:07:11,195 --> 00:07:12,625
Mrs. Karev.

172
00:07:12,939 --> 00:07:14,125
It's<i> Doctor.</i>

173
00:07:14,226 --> 00:07:15,180
Wait. What?

174
00:07:15,266 --> 00:07:17,242
Hi. Mrs. Karev. Hi.

175
00:07:17,328 --> 00:07:18,531
You're in Seattle.

176
00:07:18,617 --> 00:07:20,291
Jo. Hi.

177
00:07:20,381 --> 00:07:22,882
- Surprise!
- Um, is everything okay?

178
00:07:22,968 --> 00:07:24,422
- Does Alex know that you're here?
- Oh, yeah.

179
00:07:24,507 --> 00:07:26,195
But he told me to
meet him at a party?

180
00:07:26,281 --> 00:07:29,906
Oh. Uh... okay. Um...

181
00:07:30,091 --> 00:07:32,416
Uh, we must have got
our wires crossed.

182
00:07:32,626 --> 00:07:33,801
Um... great.

183
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:35,664
I-I can give you
a ride there.

184
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,171
Wonderful.

185
00:07:48,306 --> 00:07:49,721
<i>You've reached
Chief Alex Karev.</i>

186
00:07:49,806 --> 00:07:51,671
<i>Leave a message.</i>

187
00:07:51,781 --> 00:07:53,023
Hey, Alex.

188
00:07:53,109 --> 00:07:54,312
It's me again.

189
00:07:54,398 --> 00:07:55,546
And your mom.

190
00:07:55,632 --> 00:07:57,476
On our way to Jackson's.

191
00:07:58,601 --> 00:07:59,701
See you soon.

192
00:08:02,323 --> 00:08:03,698
Did you fly here, or...

193
00:08:03,784 --> 00:08:07,664
Oh, a bus and a train
and another bus.

194
00:08:07,971 --> 00:08:10,496
I-I thought flying might
be a little overwhelming.

195
00:08:10,596 --> 00:08:12,210
Yes. It can be.

196
00:08:12,371 --> 00:08:15,086
You know, I, uh...
I read this book recently,

197
00:08:15,178 --> 00:08:17,999
uh, about the Lewis and Clark expedition.
- Mm-hmm.

198
00:08:18,085 --> 00:08:20,581
And they encountered
so many hardships

199
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:23,242
making almost the same journey
that I just did.

200
00:08:23,495 --> 00:08:27,020
So I thought, if they
could do that on horseback,

201
00:08:27,106 --> 00:08:30,226
fighting disease,
then why couldn't I?

202
00:08:38,253 --> 00:08:39,382
- Oh! Hey.
- Oh.

203
00:08:39,468 --> 00:08:40,820
- Hey.
- Hey!

204
00:08:40,906 --> 00:08:42,440
Sorry you had to see that,
Hunt.

205
00:08:42,526 --> 00:08:43,656
But she's
just so damn happy.

206
00:08:43,742 --> 00:08:45,368
She can't
keep her hands off me.

207
00:08:45,453 --> 00:08:47,338
- What? Why?
- Oh, h... he surprised me.

208
00:08:47,493 --> 00:08:49,187
Yeah, with a trip
to Palm Springs.

209
00:08:49,273 --> 00:08:51,418
A little fun in the sun
before baby makes three.

210
00:08:51,504 --> 00:08:53,359
Or, uh, four.

211
00:08:53,445 --> 00:08:55,481
What? You're going on a trip?
I mean, you're seven months pregnant.

212
00:08:55,566 --> 00:08:57,469
Yeah, I'm aware of how
pregnant I am, Owen. Yeah.

213
00:08:57,554 --> 00:08:59,226
It's perfectly safe
for me to travel.

214
00:08:59,312 --> 00:09:00,621
Yeah. First class.
She'll be in good hands.

215
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:02,291
Mm. My hands.
Mm. Shall we?

216
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:07,801
- Hey!
- Hi!

217
00:09:07,886 --> 00:09:08,961
- Come on in!
- Good to see you.

218
00:09:09,046 --> 00:09:10,968
- Good to see you. All right.
- Hey.

219
00:09:11,062 --> 00:09:12,781
- Welcome, guys. Welcome.
- Thanks. - Hi.

220
00:09:12,867 --> 00:09:13,914
Wow.

221
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,179
Come on in.

222
00:09:15,273 --> 00:09:17,992
All right, you guys, uh,
make yourselves at home.

223
00:09:18,078 --> 00:09:21,890
M'lady, let me, uh, get you
a club soda and cran. Oh.

224
00:09:21,976 --> 00:09:23,882
You've had enough vodka tonight.

225
00:09:24,046 --> 00:09:25,311
Thank you.

226
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:30,049
Nothing for me,
thanks.

227
00:09:40,847 --> 00:09:42,405
Yes, and...
and brush your teeth

228
00:09:42,491 --> 00:09:45,108
when Tanya tells you to,
and no extra books, okay?

229
00:09:45,316 --> 00:09:46,991
I love you, too,
Elle-Belle.

230
00:09:47,077 --> 00:09:48,351
Bye.

231
00:09:48,436 --> 00:09:50,585
- You ready for another?
- Yes.

232
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:52,304
- Hey.
- Hey.

233
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:53,319
Who has the kids?

234
00:09:53,405 --> 00:09:55,390
Bailey and Zola
are at a sleepover,

235
00:09:55,476 --> 00:09:56,695
and Ellis
is with the babysitter.

236
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:58,436
Wow, empty house?

237
00:09:58,557 --> 00:10:01,327
Maybe I should, uh,
go home with you.

238
00:10:01,413 --> 00:10:03,718
- I actually wanted to tell you...
- I have no idea

239
00:10:03,804 --> 00:10:05,374
what is going on
with Owen and me.

240
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:07,343
And why we are even sleeping
in the same bed.

241
00:10:07,429 --> 00:10:09,147
I mean, it's not like
we're having any sex.

242
00:10:09,327 --> 00:10:10,931
We went from ex-sex

243
00:10:11,016 --> 00:10:13,749
to bickering married couple
in, like, 60 seconds.

244
00:10:13,835 --> 00:10:16,225
And now... now
Betty and Leo are gone,

245
00:10:16,311 --> 00:10:18,061
and we're just
both stuck in this,

246
00:10:18,147 --> 00:10:20,350
you know,
giant sinkhole of sadness.

247
00:10:20,436 --> 00:10:21,891
We've just been so focused
on the kids,

248
00:10:21,976 --> 00:10:24,022
we didn't take time
to assess the damage

249
00:10:24,108 --> 00:10:25,765
that we were doing to us.

250
00:10:28,382 --> 00:10:29,740
This sucks.

251
00:10:29,826 --> 00:10:32,061
I mean, I say, "us,"
but is there really an "us"

252
00:10:32,147 --> 00:10:33,468
with no sex and no family?

253
00:10:33,554 --> 00:10:35,218
Can I get you another glass
of wine there?

254
00:10:35,304 --> 00:10:37,796
Or anything but that?

255
00:10:37,882 --> 00:10:39,608
She's got, like,
a kajillion likes.

256
00:10:39,694 --> 00:10:41,968
Listen to this...
"I had to find the courage

257
00:10:42,054 --> 00:10:44,624
to find the answers
I could not find."

258
00:10:44,746 --> 00:10:46,710
It's clearly way too many
"finds" in one sentence.

259
00:10:46,796 --> 00:10:48,211
No, I barely get
a mention...

260
00:10:48,297 --> 00:10:51,132
It's all about the bravery
and humility it took

261
00:10:51,218 --> 00:10:54,971
to beg me to do a radical,
pioneering surgery...

262
00:10:55,056 --> 00:10:58,468
These egg rolls are going
like hotcakes.

263
00:10:58,554 --> 00:11:00,139
Oh, are you talking
about that article?

264
00:11:00,225 --> 00:11:02,069
Mnh-mnh.
Oh, that was something!

265
00:11:02,191 --> 00:11:04,550
You know, really...
really moving.

266
00:11:04,636 --> 00:11:05,819
You come off very well.

267
00:11:05,905 --> 00:11:07,155
It's like
she healed herself

268
00:11:07,241 --> 00:11:09,905
with the magical power of her own narcissism.

269
00:11:10,124 --> 00:11:11,233
I need more wine.

270
00:11:11,319 --> 00:11:12,757
Yeah.
Babe, I just off...

271
00:11:14,491 --> 00:11:16,176
Have you seen my mom?

272
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:22,608
Oh.

273
00:11:22,694 --> 00:11:24,709
I could get used to this.

274
00:11:24,904 --> 00:11:26,554
Yes, you can.

275
00:11:26,732 --> 00:11:28,280
What's to stop you?

276
00:11:28,366 --> 00:11:30,499
Hmm. Well, you have
money now, right?

277
00:11:30,679 --> 00:11:32,429
With that butt-blazer?

278
00:11:32,515 --> 00:11:33,740
T-Trail-Blazer.

279
00:11:33,826 --> 00:11:35,194
It's a golden...

280
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,436
Butt-cork.

281
00:11:36,522 --> 00:11:38,155
And you should
spend some of it.

282
00:11:38,241 --> 00:11:39,335
No... I have!

283
00:11:39,421 --> 00:11:41,166
No, I-I paid off my car,

284
00:11:41,311 --> 00:11:42,796
this year's
property taxes.

285
00:11:42,882 --> 00:11:47,233
Oh, yeah, and Ben and I did,
uh, replace the garage door.

286
00:11:47,643 --> 00:11:49,188
That's just taking care
of business.

287
00:11:49,274 --> 00:11:51,038
What have you done
for you?

288
00:11:52,046 --> 00:11:53,061
W...

289
00:11:53,147 --> 00:11:55,061
We need to talk.

290
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:56,630
Uh...

291
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,515
Oh, thanks.
No, no. This one.

292
00:12:04,884 --> 00:12:06,796
You hate this party,
don't you?

293
00:12:06,896 --> 00:12:08,233
No. No,
I-I don't hate this party.

294
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:09,718
No, I feel bad.
I mean, it's great.

295
00:12:09,804 --> 00:12:10,811
It's... It's in my honor,

296
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:12,694
"For I'm a jolly good fellow"
and all that,

297
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:15,874
but, uh, for you, it's like
a gauntlet of awkwardness.

298
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,882
Baby-daddy is really
not happy about our trip.

299
00:12:19,018 --> 00:12:21,933
Yeah, not his best moment.

300
00:12:22,522 --> 00:12:23,858
But, in fairness,

301
00:12:23,944 --> 00:12:27,577
I mean, he and Amelia had to say
goodbye to both their kids.

302
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:29,388
We can go, if you want.

303
00:12:29,486 --> 00:12:31,531
I will feign diarrhea.

304
00:12:31,686 --> 00:12:33,930
No, you won't. No,
for you, I will get diarrhea.

305
00:12:34,015 --> 00:12:35,883
- No, stop it. Stop it!
- I will. I will...

306
00:12:37,015 --> 00:12:38,670
Why?

307
00:12:40,601 --> 00:12:42,304
- Oh. Hey.
- Hey.

308
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:43,475
Have you seen my mom?

309
00:12:43,607 --> 00:12:44,718
Not your mom.

310
00:12:44,804 --> 00:12:46,155
Uh, I-is Alex here?

311
00:12:46,241 --> 00:12:47,561
Do you mind grabbing him
for me?

312
00:12:47,647 --> 00:12:49,047
Can I grab...

313
00:12:50,165 --> 00:12:52,163
Um, yeah.
Yeah, sure.

314
00:12:52,265 --> 00:12:52,936
- Okay.
- Yeah.

315
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:55,021
Um, I'm going to update
an intern

316
00:12:55,106 --> 00:12:56,741
on a patient
just real quick.

317
00:13:02,327 --> 00:13:03,640
Mom?

318
00:13:08,386 --> 00:13:10,319
What's wrong?
Hey, Jo, what's wrong?

319
00:13:10,405 --> 00:13:11,436
Nothing's wrong.

320
00:13:11,522 --> 00:13:13,296
W... You didn't tell her
to meet you here?

321
00:13:13,392 --> 00:13:14,569
Uh, no.

322
00:13:14,655 --> 00:13:16,400
No, it was...
It was the other doctor.

323
00:13:16,493 --> 00:13:18,810
- Not Alex.
- Uh, wait, w-what doctor?

324
00:13:18,896 --> 00:13:20,785
What... What doctor are you
talking... Jo, what's she...

325
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:21,985
I don't know.

326
00:13:22,071 --> 00:13:23,721
- She didn't give me her name.
- All right.

327
00:13:23,806 --> 00:13:27,526
Mom, could you, um, could you
give us a sec, please?

328
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:30,760
She was in the lobby.

329
00:13:30,846 --> 00:13:32,561
- Of the hospital?
- Yeah, to surprise you.

330
00:13:32,646 --> 00:13:33,801
You didn't say for her
to meet you here?

331
00:13:33,886 --> 00:13:35,001
No.

332
00:13:35,086 --> 00:13:37,043
Do you think the
other doctor's in her head?

333
00:13:37,128 --> 00:13:39,432
- Why didn't you call me?
- You didn't pick up your phone!

334
00:13:39,518 --> 00:13:40,507
I was playing ping-pong.

335
00:13:40,593 --> 00:13:41,777
Catherine's party
has ping-pong?

336
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:43,152
How did she seem?

337
00:13:43,237 --> 00:13:44,641
Did she seem hyper?

338
00:13:44,726 --> 00:13:45,761
Um, you know,
seeing things?

339
00:13:45,846 --> 00:13:48,393
She was, um... She was
talking a lot for her.

340
00:13:48,479 --> 00:13:49,710
Or, at least, I think.
I...

341
00:13:49,796 --> 00:13:50,751
About what?

342
00:13:50,836 --> 00:13:52,698
Lewis and Clark.

343
00:13:52,956 --> 00:13:54,386
Huh?

344
00:13:55,966 --> 00:13:57,091
All right. Look, um...

345
00:13:57,176 --> 00:13:58,821
I'm... I'm just gonna get her
back to our place, all right?

346
00:13:58,906 --> 00:13:59,991
Perfect.

347
00:14:02,306 --> 00:14:03,964
- Uh, Mom?
- No.

348
00:14:04,252 --> 00:14:06,042
- Mom?
- No!

349
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,035
Hey. Hey!

350
00:14:11,121 --> 00:14:12,768
How many ways are there
out of here?

351
00:14:12,877 --> 00:14:14,480
- Why?
- Look, just... Are... Is there, like,

352
00:14:14,565 --> 00:14:16,784
panic rooms or any place
somewhere someone could hide?

353
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:18,691
Very funny, Karev.
The place is not that big.

354
00:14:18,776 --> 00:14:19,931
Just tell me!

355
00:14:20,017 --> 00:14:22,401
Front door.
Or the fire exit upstairs.

356
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:23,549
Right. All right.

357
00:14:23,635 --> 00:14:24,924
I don't have
a panic room!

358
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:27,698
Not smart
to announce that.

359
00:14:27,917 --> 00:14:29,402
Mom?

360
00:14:37,046 --> 00:14:38,409
Hey.

361
00:14:39,226 --> 00:14:40,831
We're at a party.

362
00:14:41,753 --> 00:14:43,003
Yep.

363
00:14:43,113 --> 00:14:46,647
And you're standing out here
by yourself on the deck.

364
00:14:46,733 --> 00:14:47,948
You okay?

365
00:14:49,733 --> 00:14:51,763
That looks really good
right now.

366
00:14:53,071 --> 00:14:55,182
You want to leave?
Uh, go to a meeting? Or...

367
00:14:55,268 --> 00:14:56,317
No, I'm saying...

368
00:14:56,403 --> 00:14:57,757
Should I not
be drinking, or...

369
00:14:57,843 --> 00:14:59,276
No, t-t-that's not...

370
00:14:59,362 --> 00:15:01,538
- I mean, I'm at a party...
- Owen, that is not what I'm saying.

371
00:15:01,623 --> 00:15:04,518
I'm... I'm saying
I'm sad, too.

372
00:15:04,604 --> 00:15:06,247
I'm saying sometimes I wish

373
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:07,745
I could drink
like a normal person.

374
00:15:07,831 --> 00:15:10,206
And... It's not a big deal.
Just finish your stupid drink.

375
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:14,659
Did I do something to you?

376
00:15:14,893 --> 00:15:17,323
Are we fighting
and I missed it?

377
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:19,260
Is that a yes?

378
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,495
Really?

379
00:15:20,893 --> 00:15:22,112
We're fighting?

380
00:15:22,213 --> 00:15:23,448
That's what you want to do

381
00:15:23,534 --> 00:15:26,409
the night that we said goodbye
to Betty and Leo?

382
00:15:27,104 --> 00:15:28,818
She didn't say goodbye.

383
00:15:34,734 --> 00:15:36,158
Look, I don't want to fight.
I just want to talk.

384
00:15:36,243 --> 00:15:38,620
We have not talked
in weeks.

385
00:15:39,113 --> 00:15:40,753
Okay, let's talk.

386
00:15:41,496 --> 00:15:42,878
Okay.

387
00:15:43,459 --> 00:15:44,885
Let's talk.

388
00:15:45,923 --> 00:15:47,081
Where do we start?

389
00:15:47,241 --> 00:15:49,862
- How about "piss poor life choices"?
- Wow.

390
00:15:49,948 --> 00:15:53,633
Or how you refuse to accept
that addiction is a disease?

391
00:15:53,727 --> 00:15:55,551
- I never said that.
- You may as well have.

392
00:15:55,637 --> 00:15:57,151
Why do you do that?

393
00:15:57,237 --> 00:15:59,651
You always throw things
in my face that I said months ago.

394
00:15:59,737 --> 00:16:01,738
- I hate it.
- And I hate... I hate

395
00:16:01,824 --> 00:16:05,723
that... you have not asked me how
I have been through any of this.

396
00:16:05,809 --> 00:16:07,302
- I've be in pain, Amelia.
- Yeah, and when

397
00:16:07,387 --> 00:16:08,588
you're in pain,
you go silent.

398
00:16:08,673 --> 00:16:10,113
You... You keep it
all inside.

399
00:16:10,199 --> 00:16:12,543
You act like you are all alone in it,
and you are not.

400
00:16:12,629 --> 00:16:14,364
Yeah, because I-I-I-I
haven't been able to fix it.

401
00:16:14,449 --> 00:16:15,724
- So I just...
- So... So we should just never

402
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:17,286
- talk about it?
- We don't never talk about it.

403
00:16:17,371 --> 00:16:19,767
I hate
how you generalize.

404
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:21,908
You know, "You always do this,
and you always do that."

405
00:16:21,993 --> 00:16:24,208
Okay, you literally
just did that to me.

406
00:16:24,293 --> 00:16:26,908
You said I "always"
throw things in your face.

407
00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:31,325
Are we trying to talk,
or are you just trying to win?

408
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:34,117
Well, I wanted to talk,
but it's kind of hard

409
00:16:34,203 --> 00:16:37,409
when you have been staring
at Teddy the entire time.

410
00:16:37,495 --> 00:16:39,287
How about you?

411
00:16:49,265 --> 00:16:50,420
Thank you.

412
00:16:50,794 --> 00:16:53,238
- Hey!
- Hey.

413
00:16:53,324 --> 00:16:55,480
Mm. Nice article.

414
00:16:55,862 --> 00:16:58,777
Really? Teddy? Was it?

415
00:16:58,863 --> 00:17:01,097
Or was it just some puff piece
on a website

416
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:03,019
that may as well
be called "OMG! BOYS!"

417
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:04,723
Well, I mean, I thought it was really...
- No.

418
00:17:04,808 --> 00:17:06,644
You know, they should
really read my piece

419
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:08,895
that I just submitted to the<i> Journal
of Cardiothoracic Advancement,</i>

420
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:11,183
where I actually outline
the procedure!

421
00:17:11,269 --> 00:17:13,887
All right, well, I'll do that when...
- No, you won't.

422
00:17:13,973 --> 00:17:15,458
Because they probably
won't even publish it now,

423
00:17:15,543 --> 00:17:18,458
because it's just
the same story, only boring.

424
00:17:18,543 --> 00:17:19,652
'Cause who needs science

425
00:17:19,738 --> 00:17:21,792
when there's pluckiness
and spunk?

426
00:17:29,004 --> 00:17:30,519
Helen?

427
00:17:36,652 --> 00:17:38,331
I do hate this party.

428
00:17:40,652 --> 00:17:42,607
Hey. You're leaving?

429
00:17:42,785 --> 00:17:44,339
Hi. I, um...

430
00:17:44,425 --> 00:17:46,750
Tanya called, and Ellis
is really scared, so...

431
00:17:46,836 --> 00:17:48,127
Oh, oh,
I can pick her up.

432
00:17:48,213 --> 00:17:49,998
No. It's a party
in your honor.

433
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:51,832
- You can't leave.
- It's not really an honor

434
00:17:51,917 --> 00:17:53,839
when you didn't
get 100% margins.

435
00:17:54,032 --> 00:17:57,589
And on top of that, I think Owen
still has feelings for Teddy.

436
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:59,355
You should have seen
how he reacted

437
00:17:59,441 --> 00:18:01,403
when he found out that she was
going on vacation with Koracick.

438
00:18:01,488 --> 00:18:03,833
Teddy is always going
to be in Owen's life.

439
00:18:04,023 --> 00:18:05,253
Baby or no baby.

440
00:18:05,339 --> 00:18:06,854
It was this way
for Cristina.

441
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:09,066
It's been this way
your whole marriage.

442
00:18:09,152 --> 00:18:10,995
And your divorce.

443
00:18:11,508 --> 00:18:12,993
It's not gonna change.

444
00:18:13,198 --> 00:18:15,113
Just make peace with it.

445
00:18:16,894 --> 00:18:19,152
I'm not in a love triangle.
This is a circle.

446
00:18:19,238 --> 00:18:21,313
And it just keeps going
around and around.

447
00:18:23,159 --> 00:18:26,081
I'm definitely staying
at your place tonight.

448
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:33,597
Historians believe
that Meriwether Lewis

449
00:18:33,683 --> 00:18:34,738
had bipolar disorder,

450
00:18:34,824 --> 00:18:37,136
but in
the early 19th century,

451
00:18:37,222 --> 00:18:39,316
they called it,
um, "melancholy."

452
00:18:39,412 --> 00:18:41,956
Mm. So you're
a psychologist?

453
00:18:42,042 --> 00:18:43,324
- Librarian.
- Oh.

454
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:44,738
H-How do you
know Catherine?

455
00:18:44,824 --> 00:18:46,886
- Who?
- Mom.

456
00:18:46,972 --> 00:18:48,433
What?

457
00:18:48,566 --> 00:18:49,949
Look, uh, DeLuca, thanks.

458
00:18:50,035 --> 00:18:50,910
Yeah.

459
00:18:50,996 --> 00:18:52,016
He's very nice.

460
00:18:52,102 --> 00:18:53,949
Yeah.
Oh, thank God.

461
00:18:55,777 --> 00:18:57,257
Oh, I worried you.

462
00:18:57,343 --> 00:18:58,628
Yeah, you had us worried.

463
00:18:58,714 --> 00:19:00,081
I am doing well.

464
00:19:00,167 --> 00:19:01,269
I feel sturdy.

465
00:19:01,355 --> 00:19:03,191
How about I give you
both a minute?

466
00:19:07,155 --> 00:19:08,610
I made something for you.

467
00:19:08,867 --> 00:19:10,089
Oh.

468
00:19:10,327 --> 00:19:14,011
When you were a little boy,
green was your favorite color,

469
00:19:14,143 --> 00:19:17,199
but it could have changed by now,
so you can just pick.

470
00:19:18,463 --> 00:19:21,088
Yeah, it's, uh... it's not
much of a wedding gift.

471
00:19:21,173 --> 00:19:22,434
Uh, y-you don't
have to take one.

472
00:19:22,519 --> 00:19:24,449
- That's okay.
- No, no, no. Green is good.

473
00:19:24,535 --> 00:19:25,688
It's... It's... It's great.

474
00:19:25,773 --> 00:19:27,581
It's... It's lovely.

475
00:19:27,794 --> 00:19:29,308
Okay, what about Jo?

476
00:19:29,962 --> 00:19:31,339
Blue.

477
00:19:32,127 --> 00:19:33,495
Okay.

478
00:19:33,581 --> 00:19:34,863
Oh, Dr. Grey.

479
00:19:35,144 --> 00:19:37,183
Excuse me, Bokhee, Jae.

480
00:19:39,353 --> 00:19:40,495
Mm.

481
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:43,959
Bokhee.

482
00:19:45,527 --> 00:19:47,477
Uh, I got your text.
Yeah.

483
00:19:47,563 --> 00:19:49,941
- Is everything okay?
- No. Amelia's in a state.

484
00:19:50,027 --> 00:19:51,077
Oh.

485
00:19:51,163 --> 00:19:53,644
So I think
I'm on duty tonight.

486
00:20:11,443 --> 00:20:13,988
In the guest room?

487
00:20:15,553 --> 00:20:16,878
Hey.

488
00:20:17,493 --> 00:20:19,058
What?

489
00:20:19,413 --> 00:20:22,589
I'm just trying to burn this
image in my head forever.

490
00:20:23,864 --> 00:20:26,300
Okay, but you do realize
nothing is happening

491
00:20:26,386 --> 00:20:29,158
in the guest room of
Jackson Avery's house, right,

492
00:20:29,243 --> 00:20:31,603
with all of our co-workers
downstairs?

493
00:20:34,413 --> 00:20:35,713
Okay.

494
00:20:37,713 --> 00:20:40,143
<i>Speaking Italian...</i>

495
00:20:48,058 --> 00:20:50,089
I... Look,
I don't know how long

496
00:20:50,175 --> 00:20:51,778
the Trail-Blazer's success
will run.

497
00:20:51,863 --> 00:20:53,948
It's like, what if
somebody else comes along

498
00:20:54,033 --> 00:20:55,090
with something better?

499
00:20:55,175 --> 00:20:56,808
All my checks... poof.

500
00:20:56,894 --> 00:20:59,219
Bailey,
that's how money works.

501
00:20:59,305 --> 00:21:01,769
I mean, my grandfather
made a fortune

502
00:21:01,855 --> 00:21:04,388
when he opened
a candy store in 1921.

503
00:21:04,473 --> 00:21:07,652
- And what happened in 1927?
- Mnh. Poof?

504
00:21:07,738 --> 00:21:10,628
My father didn't have shoes
that fit for over a month.

505
00:21:10,713 --> 00:21:12,581
Oh. I'm just trying to tell you

506
00:21:12,667 --> 00:21:14,956
that money comes,
money goes.

507
00:21:15,042 --> 00:21:17,167
And what's the point
if you lose it

508
00:21:17,253 --> 00:21:19,285
before you get to
enjoy it a little?

509
00:21:20,167 --> 00:21:23,308
So, you want me to buy
myself a few hospitals?

510
00:21:23,393 --> 00:21:24,706
How many to start, three?

511
00:21:24,836 --> 00:21:26,941
Start slow, honey. Okay.

512
00:21:27,129 --> 00:21:30,613
What is the one thing that
you haven't let yourself get?

513
00:21:30,699 --> 00:21:32,574
Come on.
There's got to be something.

514
00:21:33,535 --> 00:21:37,188
The C7500 TurboMix in red.

515
00:21:39,232 --> 00:21:43,738
Uh, soups, smoothies, dips,
dressings, desserts...

516
00:21:43,824 --> 00:21:45,831
You can make
Christmas dinner with it.

517
00:21:45,917 --> 00:21:48,098
And... it cleans itself.

518
00:21:48,183 --> 00:21:49,238
Act of God.

519
00:21:49,323 --> 00:21:50,660
What is it?

520
00:21:51,068 --> 00:21:52,213
A blender.

521
00:21:52,353 --> 00:21:53,675
Oh, Lord.

522
00:21:53,761 --> 00:21:54,745
- What?
- Well, you should just

523
00:21:54,831 --> 00:21:55,902
buy the damn thing.

524
00:21:55,988 --> 00:21:57,238
Look at that price.

525
00:21:57,323 --> 00:22:00,003
Bailey, think about when
you walk into your kitchen,

526
00:22:00,089 --> 00:22:02,097
and it's gleaming at you
from the counter

527
00:22:02,183 --> 00:22:04,706
with its five
programmable speeds.

528
00:22:04,922 --> 00:22:07,308
The price is nothing
compared to that joy...

529
00:22:07,394 --> 00:22:09,105
I bought it!

530
00:22:09,191 --> 00:22:10,667
All right!

531
00:22:10,766 --> 00:22:12,927
We got
something to celebrate.

532
00:22:13,013 --> 00:22:15,308
Come on.
N-No, it's almost 8:00.

533
00:22:15,394 --> 00:22:16,605
We need to get to the party.

534
00:22:16,691 --> 00:22:18,358
Oh, please,
I'm not going to that.

535
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:22,074
Mmm.

536
00:22:25,652 --> 00:22:29,578
Well, this is the last
of the duck sauce.

537
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:32,464
Avery, thanks for everything,
but I gotta... I'm heading out.

538
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:33,605
What? No, no, no.

539
00:22:33,691 --> 00:22:35,503
- Come on.
- Listen, I'm sorry. I just...

540
00:22:36,191 --> 00:22:37,527
God, I hate that guy.

541
00:22:39,745 --> 00:22:41,713
Who... Koracick?

542
00:22:41,799 --> 00:22:43,534
Oh, well, yeah.
He's a creep.

543
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:45,542
- What? You think so, too?
- I know so.

544
00:22:45,628 --> 00:22:48,034
He took advantage of April
during a pretty vulnerable time.

545
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,847
You're kidding.
He's been after Catherine

546
00:22:49,933 --> 00:22:51,253
since the minute
he got into town.

547
00:22:51,339 --> 00:22:53,308
What is she...
What is she doing with him?

548
00:22:53,456 --> 00:22:55,402
I can't say I'd be thrilled
if I were you.

549
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:59,143
On the other hand,
he did save my mom's life,

550
00:22:59,229 --> 00:23:00,238
so I don't know.

551
00:23:01,511 --> 00:23:03,229
But it's a party for you!

552
00:23:03,315 --> 00:23:04,893
It's for Shepherd
and Koracick.

553
00:23:04,979 --> 00:23:07,292
Because they saved
your life.

554
00:23:07,378 --> 00:23:08,636
They did.

555
00:23:08,972 --> 00:23:11,190
They performed
an astonishing feat,

556
00:23:11,276 --> 00:23:12,917
and for that,
I am forever grateful.

557
00:23:13,003 --> 00:23:16,557
But Miranda, if I walk
into that party right now,

558
00:23:16,643 --> 00:23:18,433
people are gonna come up to me
and say things like,

559
00:23:18,518 --> 00:23:20,228
"Oh, congratulations,."

560
00:23:20,313 --> 00:23:21,597
"You did it"...

561
00:23:22,373 --> 00:23:25,599
Like it's all over,
like I'm cancer-free.

562
00:23:26,607 --> 00:23:30,068
Yes, my tumor hasn't gotten
any bigger, but it could.

563
00:23:30,153 --> 00:23:31,669
It could.

564
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:36,232
And so I have to live in dread
from one scan to the next.

565
00:23:36,493 --> 00:23:38,474
For every scan.

566
00:23:38,793 --> 00:23:41,778
I'm never gonna be out of
the woods with this thing,

567
00:23:42,037 --> 00:23:45,873
and it's not something
I feel like celebrating.

568
00:23:46,732 --> 00:23:48,349
Hypocrite.

569
00:23:49,294 --> 00:23:50,396
Excuse me?

570
00:23:50,482 --> 00:23:53,591
You're all easy come, easy go
when it comes to money,

571
00:23:53,677 --> 00:23:55,654
but you're afraid
to spend joy.

572
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:57,896
What... you think
you're gonna run out of it?

573
00:23:58,676 --> 00:24:02,357
That dread between scans
is scary.

574
00:24:02,443 --> 00:24:04,438
But it's life.

575
00:24:04,755 --> 00:24:09,117
And it's not perfect,
but it's the one you get now.

576
00:24:09,334 --> 00:24:10,738
W-What I get.

577
00:24:10,823 --> 00:24:13,508
I-I have a heart that
I no longer trust.

578
00:24:13,593 --> 00:24:18,990
I live day by day trying to
get it to not blow up again

579
00:24:19,076 --> 00:24:22,201
and hoping that the fix
they gave me stays a fix.

580
00:24:22,287 --> 00:24:23,623
And you?
You have

581
00:24:23,709 --> 00:24:25,216
a piece of tumor
on your spine,

582
00:24:25,302 --> 00:24:29,584
and it could get bigger
or it could not.

583
00:24:29,692 --> 00:24:31,146
And you know what?

584
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:34,818
An earthquake could take us
all out tomorrow.

585
00:24:35,037 --> 00:24:37,701
Or a meteor.
Or robots.

586
00:24:37,787 --> 00:24:39,505
We don't get to know that.

587
00:24:39,896 --> 00:24:41,808
<i>Banners' "Got It In You

588
00:24:41,893 --> 00:24:46,037
But just right now,
we're alive...

589
00:24:46,123 --> 00:24:48,115
We are still here.

590
00:24:48,201 --> 00:24:50,654
And people love us, so,

591
00:24:50,966 --> 00:24:53,288
that's cause to celebrate.

592

<i>♪ Holding back the flood

593
00:24:56,693 --> 00:24:58,396
Hey, excuse me.

594
00:24:58,482 --> 00:24:59,552
Can we talk?

595
00:24:59,638 --> 00:25:00,897
What else is there
to talk about?

596
00:25:00,982 --> 00:25:02,209
Listen, I wasn't
looking at Teddy.

597
00:25:02,294 --> 00:25:03,798
I was looking at Koracick.

598
00:25:03,883 --> 00:25:05,201
Okay?
I don't like that guy.

599
00:25:05,287 --> 00:25:06,693
I don't like that
he's dating Teddy.

600
00:25:06,779 --> 00:25:07,748
Because you're jealous.

601
00:25:07,834 --> 00:25:11,123
No, because he's like a dog
marking his territory.

602
00:25:11,209 --> 00:25:13,865
And because who hits on a woman
who's seven months pregnant?

603
00:25:13,951 --> 00:25:15,943
That's Tom.
He's available. Always.

604
00:25:16,029 --> 00:25:17,935
He was available for me
after the tumor.

605
00:25:18,208 --> 00:25:20,005
- Wait. What?
- Why does it matter?

606
00:25:20,138 --> 00:25:23,357
If you're not interested
in Teddy, what does it matter?

607
00:25:23,443 --> 00:25:25,420
If he's with her, then he's
gonna be in my daughter's life,

608
00:25:25,505 --> 00:25:27,201
and I don't want that.

609
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:29,755
This has got nothing
to do with Teddy.

610
00:25:30,271 --> 00:25:32,038
How many times do I have
to choose you, Amelia,

611
00:25:32,123 --> 00:25:33,826
for you to stop feeling
insecure?

612
00:25:33,912 --> 00:25:35,158
Insecure?

613
00:25:35,395 --> 00:25:37,779
This is not about some fling
from your past.

614
00:25:37,865 --> 00:25:39,748
She is pregnant
with your child right now

615
00:25:39,834 --> 00:25:43,292
because you got on a plane
to profess your love to her

616
00:25:43,378 --> 00:25:44,255
seven months ago.

617
00:25:44,341 --> 00:25:46,623
Not... Not seven years.
Seven months.

618
00:25:46,709 --> 00:25:48,794
So forgive me for worrying
that maybe your feelings

619
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,240
might still be lingering,

620
00:25:50,326 --> 00:25:52,338
and that maybe
when you see your baby,

621
00:25:52,685 --> 00:25:55,341
you are gonna realize how deeply
you are in love with her.

622
00:25:55,427 --> 00:25:58,918
You and I fell back in love
over children that we adored

623
00:25:59,003 --> 00:26:01,048
and that
we no longer have.

624
00:26:01,133 --> 00:26:02,466
Okay? Do you
really think that,

625
00:26:02,552 --> 00:26:04,708
when you see your daughter
lying in Teddy's arms,

626
00:26:04,794 --> 00:26:05,874
that you are not gonna think

627
00:26:05,959 --> 00:26:07,163
that maybe this is
where you belong?

628
00:26:07,248 --> 00:26:08,537
Because I do.

629
00:26:08,623 --> 00:26:10,428
And maybe you're right.
Maybe that is insecurity.

630
00:26:10,513 --> 00:26:12,058
Or maybe it is wisdom.

631
00:26:12,255 --> 00:26:14,271
Whatever you want to call it,
it is what I believe.

632
00:26:14,357 --> 00:26:15,880
And I cannot talk my way
out of it.

633
00:26:15,966 --> 00:26:17,310
I can't.

634
00:26:17,591 --> 00:26:19,724

This is
not the restroom.

693
00:28:46,895 --> 00:28:48,888
No, that's, uh...
That's down the hall.

694
00:28:50,373 --> 00:28:51,918
We're not...

695
00:28:52,245 --> 00:28:53,685
I...

696
00:28:55,529 --> 00:28:57,622
Alex knows.

697
00:28:58,443 --> 00:28:59,398
W-Wonderful.

698
00:28:59,483 --> 00:29:02,768
Uh, don't let me keep you.

699
00:29:02,868 --> 00:29:04,268
Hmm.

700
00:29:06,283 --> 00:29:08,130
Oh, my...

701
00:29:08,216 --> 00:29:09,489
I told you!

702
00:29:09,575 --> 00:29:11,477
It's not funny!
It's not funny!

703
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:17,935
Hey. I can do this.
Thanks.

704
00:29:21,216 --> 00:29:22,731
What are you doing?

705
00:29:22,817 --> 00:29:24,302
Oh, I'm being normal.

706
00:29:24,388 --> 00:29:26,273
Huh. Will you put these
in the oven for me?

707
00:29:26,359 --> 00:29:27,814
I don't think
this counts as normal.

708
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:29,245
Jackson hired people
to do this.

709
00:29:29,331 --> 00:29:31,934
- Just do it.
- Okay, you're flustered.

710
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,278
Yes,
I'm getting flustered.

711
00:29:33,364 --> 00:29:34,579
Richard just
walked in on us.

712
00:29:34,665 --> 00:29:36,458
Yeah, kissing.

713
00:29:36,857 --> 00:29:37,989
At a work party.

714
00:29:38,075 --> 00:29:40,505
So now I feel like
everybody's staring at us.

715
00:29:40,777 --> 00:29:42,307
No one is staring at us.

716
00:29:43,322 --> 00:29:44,907
Because we're
acting normal.

717
00:29:47,644 --> 00:29:51,059
And after going to many doctors,
this woman found Maggie.

718
00:29:51,145 --> 00:29:53,317
She was
a med school acquaintance,

719
00:29:53,403 --> 00:29:54,583
and after that,
they...

720
00:29:54,669 --> 00:29:56,325
Excuse us.
Just one second.

721
00:29:56,411 --> 00:29:57,387
Uh, excuse me for a second.

722
00:29:57,473 --> 00:29:58,787
Please stop telling people

723
00:29:58,872 --> 00:30:01,536
- about that article, please?
- Why? It's very nice.

724
00:30:01,622 --> 00:30:04,458
No, it's not.
And she is not.

725
00:30:04,643 --> 00:30:07,520
That was my story to tell,
for doctors,

726
00:30:07,606 --> 00:30:10,145
in a way that mattered,
and she stole it.

727
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:13,967
She is a bully who made me
feel small and insignificant,

728
00:30:14,053 --> 00:30:16,458
and she is still managing,
even from a thousand miles away,

729
00:30:16,544 --> 00:30:18,006
to make me feel small
and insignificant!

730
00:30:18,091 --> 00:30:19,795
Maggie Pierce. You are not small and insig...
- No, no!

731
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:20,887
Please, please, don't...

732
00:30:20,973 --> 00:30:23,518
Don't say anything kind
or comforting or consoling.

733
00:30:23,603 --> 00:30:25,505
I'm pissed.
I want to stay pissed.

734
00:30:25,591 --> 00:30:27,770
I want
to burn something down!

735
00:30:33,717 --> 00:30:38,098
Did you know that I was the only
black resident in my class?

736
00:30:38,247 --> 00:30:39,903
So I was bullied, too.

737
00:30:40,043 --> 00:30:42,888
Residents would take my number
off the pager service...

738
00:30:43,013 --> 00:30:45,669
- Oh, my God.
- So I'd miss traumas.

739
00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:49,537
Some of the attendings would
call the other residents "Dr."

740
00:30:49,623 --> 00:30:51,833
But I only got "Webber."

741
00:30:52,463 --> 00:30:54,993
And I was plenty pissed.

742
00:30:56,250 --> 00:31:00,017
But I found out that
it's no good to be pissed

743
00:31:00,153 --> 00:31:01,895
if you don't use it.

744
00:31:02,345 --> 00:31:04,317
You know, the difference
between a great surgeon

745
00:31:04,403 --> 00:31:06,218
and a celebration
surgeon...

746
00:31:06,403 --> 00:31:08,558
is a little bit
of what Kiki has.

747
00:31:08,723 --> 00:31:10,341
A little flair
for promotion.

748
00:31:10,427 --> 00:31:11,702
You could use
a little of that.

749
00:31:11,788 --> 00:31:14,373
If someone takes your story,
you take it back,

750
00:31:14,459 --> 00:31:16,544
and you tell it louder.

751
00:31:17,174 --> 00:31:20,359
Stop publication of that piece,
and rewrite it,

752
00:31:20,512 --> 00:31:22,083
from your point of view.

753
00:31:22,282 --> 00:31:24,867
Start that fire,
Maggie Pierce.

754
00:31:41,143 --> 00:31:42,802
Hi. You want something
to eat?

755
00:31:43,073 --> 00:31:44,841
I'm happy to see you.

756
00:31:44,927 --> 00:31:47,255
It's just, uh,
it threw me.

757
00:31:47,683 --> 00:31:49,161
I mean, uh...

758
00:31:49,247 --> 00:31:52,137
I mean, it really means a lot
for Jo and me both.

759
00:31:52,517 --> 00:31:54,942
Tires. No.

760
00:31:55,282 --> 00:31:56,723
Tennis shoes.

761
00:31:57,225 --> 00:31:59,207
- Melting tennis shoes.
- What?

762
00:31:59,293 --> 00:32:01,833
- Don't you smell that?
- No.

763
00:32:02,317 --> 00:32:03,865
All right, t-take it easy.
Take it easy.

764
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:05,887
The... The shoes...

765
00:32:05,973 --> 00:32:07,359
The shoes you had in
high school, the red ones.

766
00:32:07,444 --> 00:32:08,518
Remember?
They were on sale.

767
00:32:08,603 --> 00:32:10,755
But they're
burning.

768
00:32:10,943 --> 00:32:12,458
The shoe...

769
00:32:12,887 --> 00:32:14,998
Alex,
we are really high up.

770
00:32:15,162 --> 00:32:16,724
Honestly, everybody needs
to get out of here right now.

771
00:32:16,809 --> 00:32:17,858
But, Mom,
there is no fire.

772
00:32:17,943 --> 00:32:20,372
Yes, there is!
There is!

773
00:32:20,548 --> 00:32:22,863
Mom, come on. Just stop.
Just calm down.

774
00:32:22,988 --> 00:32:25,380
Come on. Sit down.
Come on. Please?

775
00:32:25,653 --> 00:32:27,153
It's gonna be all right.

776
00:32:29,259 --> 00:32:31,161
I am a little hungry.

777
00:32:31,817 --> 00:32:34,278
What if you go into
labor when you're out of town?

778
00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:36,548
They have hospitals
in California...

779
00:32:36,633 --> 00:32:37,864
But I wouldn't be there.

780
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:40,487
Well, a flight
is not even three hours.

781
00:32:40,573 --> 00:32:41,448
I wanna be there.

782
00:32:41,533 --> 00:32:44,348
I understand that,
but I'm taking this trip.

783
00:32:46,124 --> 00:32:47,567
And what is this about,
Teddy?

784
00:32:47,653 --> 00:32:49,645
You want that dirtbag
in the delivery room?

785
00:32:49,731 --> 00:32:50,825
- Whoa.
- I mean,

786
00:32:50,911 --> 00:32:51,831
do you want him around
our daughter?

787
00:32:51,917 --> 00:32:53,495
He is not a good guy.

788
00:32:53,598 --> 00:32:55,677
I think he's a great guy.

789
00:32:55,811 --> 00:32:58,145
And he saved Amelia's life,
and he's...

790
00:32:58,661 --> 00:33:00,247
Hey.
Uh, pickles,

791
00:33:00,333 --> 00:33:02,178
uh, seven almonds,
pasteurized cheese.

792
00:33:02,264 --> 00:33:03,623
- But one of the almonds is for me.
- Thank you.

793
00:33:03,708 --> 00:33:05,286
Okay.
Uh, do you mind?

794
00:33:05,372 --> 00:33:07,028
Uh, we're in the middle
of something.

795
00:33:07,114 --> 00:33:09,184
I do mind.
But thanks for asking.

796
00:33:13,911 --> 00:33:15,918
- Mom. Hey. You made it.
- Oh.

797
00:33:16,003 --> 00:33:17,758
- Yeah. Mm.
- Finally.

798
00:33:17,843 --> 00:33:20,012
She's your problem now.

799
00:33:20,098 --> 00:33:22,122
All right. Everyone!

800
00:33:22,343 --> 00:33:24,075
Our guest of honor is here.

801
00:33:24,161 --> 00:33:26,131
- There's nothing fun about any of this.
- Alex, we have to get out of here.

802
00:33:26,216 --> 00:33:27,137
All right,
w-we're gonna go.

803
00:33:27,223 --> 00:33:28,161
- We're gonna leave.
- No, uh...

804
00:33:28,247 --> 00:33:29,678
Karev. Can you just stay
till after the toast?

805
00:33:29,763 --> 00:33:30,974
Do you hear him, Teddy?
Do you hear these words...

806
00:33:31,059 --> 00:33:33,537
Mom, come on over.
All right, folks, over here. Oh.

807
00:33:33,623 --> 00:33:34,567
You're starting to upset her.
And embarrass yourself.

808
00:33:34,653 --> 00:33:36,538
Hey. She's seven
months pregnant, Tom,

809
00:33:36,623 --> 00:33:38,178
so why don't you just do the right thing?
So, what... what,

810
00:33:38,263 --> 00:33:39,834
we're on a first-name basis now?
Because I barely know you.

811
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:42,208
Wait. What was it again? It was Oliver? Ollie?
- No, no, I know you.

812
00:33:42,293 --> 00:33:43,560
Because any man
who would prey on

813
00:33:43,645 --> 00:33:44,982
- a vulnerable pregnant woman.
- Okay, over here.

814
00:33:45,067 --> 00:33:46,178
Okay, okay,
this was a blast,

815
00:33:46,263 --> 00:33:47,448
but I shouldn't keep
my public waiting.

816
00:33:47,533 --> 00:33:48,615
And I will tell you another
thing, Tom.

817
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:49,787
If you think you're gonna
be around my kid,

818
00:33:49,872 --> 00:33:51,021
then you have
another thing coming.

819
00:33:51,106 --> 00:33:52,209
'Cause you may be
many things,

820
00:33:52,294 --> 00:33:53,988
- but a father isn't one of them!
- Owen!

821
00:33:55,247 --> 00:33:56,558
- Oh, wow!
- What the hell?!

822
00:33:56,643 --> 00:33:58,067
- Oh!
- Okay. I'm done.

823
00:33:58,153 --> 00:34:00,966
- Owen!
- Owen, he<i> is</i> a father!

824
00:34:01,052 --> 00:34:02,256
All right,
if you're gonna punch him,

825
00:34:02,341 --> 00:34:04,261
you're gonna have to go through
a pregnant woman.

826
00:34:05,653 --> 00:34:08,253
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I...
- Oh, don't be. All right.

827
00:34:13,123 --> 00:34:17,248
Million dollar hand.
Sorry, Avery, proceed.

828
00:34:17,333 --> 00:34:20,575
Yeah. Um, anyway,
as you can see,

829
00:34:20,661 --> 00:34:23,016
I am so happy to be standing
here with...

830
00:34:23,102 --> 00:34:24,147
Fire!

831
00:34:26,003 --> 00:34:27,358
- What's that?
- It's a fire.

832
00:34:27,443 --> 00:34:29,558
It's a real fire!

833
00:34:29,643 --> 00:34:30,998
Uh, all right,
well, okay...

834
00:34:31,083 --> 00:34:32,658
There appears to be
a small situation here.

835
00:34:32,743 --> 00:34:34,728
Just carefully... if you all
could make your way...

836
00:34:34,813 --> 00:34:35,728
Be safe.

837
00:34:35,813 --> 00:34:36,768
Oh, no!

838
00:34:38,123 --> 00:34:39,698
Come on, everybody.
It's a real fire!

839
00:34:39,783 --> 00:34:41,768
Come on, Mom.

840
00:34:53,707 --> 00:34:56,388
I told you I didn't want
to have a party.

841
00:34:57,322 --> 00:34:59,977
If I could get
everyone's attention, please,

842
00:35:00,063 --> 00:35:02,106
the building is cleared
for re-entry.

843
00:35:02,192 --> 00:35:05,117
Everyone except
the penthouse level.

844
00:35:05,317 --> 00:35:07,059
The fumes are still
pretty bad up there,

845
00:35:07,145 --> 00:35:08,791
and it should really air out
for a few days.

846
00:35:08,876 --> 00:35:10,731
- Ben.
- Plastic in the oven.

847
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:11,817
See it all the time.

848
00:35:11,923 --> 00:35:13,872
Bad smoke but no fire.

849
00:35:13,996 --> 00:35:16,419
Who put plastic
in the oven?

850
00:35:16,505 --> 00:35:18,130
Sometimes the trays
look like metal.

851
00:35:18,216 --> 00:35:19,707
Think it might've been
egg rolls.

852
00:35:19,793 --> 00:35:21,114
<i>You've got access?</i>

853
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,847
We don't know that
that was us.

854
00:35:22,933 --> 00:35:24,302
We're pretty sure it was.

855
00:35:25,659 --> 00:35:27,231
- Mer!
- Yeah?

856
00:35:27,317 --> 00:35:30,036
Meredith Grey... I want you
to meet my mother, Helen.

857
00:35:30,682 --> 00:35:34,537
Helen.
It's so nice to meet you.

858
00:35:34,787 --> 00:35:37,778
Meredith...
you're Alex's best friend.

859
00:35:38,011 --> 00:35:39,934
I am. And he's mine.

860
00:35:43,062 --> 00:35:44,537
That smoke is messing
with my eyes.

861
00:35:44,623 --> 00:35:45,662
Let's go.
Come on. Come on.

862
00:35:45,747 --> 00:35:47,599
Good night.

863
00:35:50,193 --> 00:35:51,661
Oh.

864
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:54,395
Amelia doesn't need to
stay at my house now.

865
00:35:54,589 --> 00:35:56,004
Oh.

866
00:35:56,090 --> 00:35:57,346
But maybe we should
go to your house

867
00:35:57,431 --> 00:35:59,075
just in case she changes
her mind again.

868
00:35:59,161 --> 00:36:00,434
Yeah.
Okay.

869
00:36:03,873 --> 00:36:06,067
I didn't mean
to be ungrateful.

870
00:36:06,686 --> 00:36:08,587
But you know how hard
this is for me, baby.

871
00:36:08,673 --> 00:36:10,302
It's hard for everyone.

872
00:36:11,213 --> 00:36:14,419
I know I wasn't the one that
was sick, but it was hell.

873
00:36:14,910 --> 00:36:17,665
You're not the only one who gets
to have feelings, you know?

874
00:36:21,342 --> 00:36:23,897
Unfortunate way
to meet the neighbors.

875
00:36:24,021 --> 00:36:25,872
Hey, we still have
the limo.

876
00:36:26,005 --> 00:36:28,790
We could all go
somewhere together.

877
00:36:29,063 --> 00:36:30,403
And celebrate.

878
00:36:40,471 --> 00:36:44,196
Uh, you're going to see
a very expensive blender

879
00:36:44,282 --> 00:36:45,897
on our next credit-card
statement.

880
00:36:45,983 --> 00:36:47,328
Because I deserve it.

881
00:36:47,414 --> 00:36:49,569
And I need a ride home.

882
00:36:49,655 --> 00:36:51,235
There's plenty of room
in the aid car.

883
00:36:51,321 --> 00:36:52,496
Oh.

884
00:36:52,582 --> 00:36:54,778
Um, and you can wear
this uniform home

885
00:36:54,864 --> 00:36:56,338
anytime you feel like it.

886
00:36:56,423 --> 00:36:59,880
Well, I think I'm gonna need to,
'cause, uh, you are fire.

887
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:04,744
Ooh!

888
00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:07,546
This Kiki person sounds
like a real piece of work.

889
00:37:07,632 --> 00:37:09,617
She is.

890
00:37:09,703 --> 00:37:11,018
That's all right.
I'm gonna tell my story louder.

891
00:37:11,103 --> 00:37:12,895
I'm gonna start
my own fire.

892
00:37:12,981 --> 00:37:13,788
Mnh-mnh.

893
00:37:13,873 --> 00:37:15,653
Let's come up with
a new metaphor, huh, babe?

894
00:37:16,913 --> 00:37:18,592
Am I just drunk,
or is this burger amazing?

895
00:37:18,677 --> 00:37:21,592
Everything tastes better
in the back of a limousine.

896
00:37:21,678 --> 00:37:23,021
And you may also be drunk.

897
00:37:23,903 --> 00:37:26,403
Okay. From here on out...

898
00:37:28,082 --> 00:37:31,527
From here on out,
every scan that I get,

899
00:37:31,613 --> 00:37:33,083
good news or bad,

900
00:37:33,169 --> 00:37:36,859
this is how I want
to celebrate.

901
00:37:37,085 --> 00:37:40,100
In the back of my limousine,
eating trashy food,

902
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:44,234
drinking expensive champagne
and sparkling apple cider.

903
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:48,211
With the people that I love most
in this world.

904
00:37:48,609 --> 00:37:49,734
- Mwah!
- Mwah!

905
00:37:49,843 --> 00:37:50,998
Cheers to that.

906
00:37:51,083 --> 00:37:53,031
Ah!

907
00:37:53,182 --> 00:37:55,968
<i>Surgeons are reluctant
to celebrate.</i>

908
00:37:56,054 --> 00:37:58,187
<i>Even in success,
we obsess about</i>

909
00:37:58,283 --> 00:38:00,039
<i>what could have been better.</i>

910
00:38:00,789 --> 00:38:02,117
Whoa. What are you...

911
00:38:02,203 --> 00:38:03,867
Owen,
they brought Leo back.

912
00:38:03,961 --> 00:38:05,778
Why would they...

913
00:38:05,863 --> 00:38:07,445
<i>♪ I'm walking

914
00:38:09,202 --> 00:38:10,515
<i>♪ I try not to look down ♪</i>

915
00:38:10,601 --> 00:38:11,577
Can we talk?

916
00:38:13,033 --> 00:38:16,242
<i>♪ Can't stop my hands
from shaking ♪</i>

917
00:38:16,328 --> 00:38:18,287
I mean, we fought her on it
at first.

918
00:38:18,373 --> 00:38:19,961
It just felt
so crazy for us to...

919
00:38:20,173 --> 00:38:22,750
Giving up our grandchild,
but...

920
00:38:22,962 --> 00:38:25,679
We're gonna have our hands
so full with Britney,

921
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:28,227
you know,
just helping her to adjust,

922
00:38:28,313 --> 00:38:29,961
to just stay sober and...

923
00:38:30,047 --> 00:38:33,332
Sure. A-And we've
seen you with him and...

924
00:38:33,643 --> 00:38:35,037
You and Dr. Shepherd.

925
00:38:35,123 --> 00:38:38,808
<i>And don't get me wrong, that
self-reflection is important.</i>

926
00:38:38,893 --> 00:38:41,448
You brought
our Britney back to us.

927
00:38:41,533 --> 00:38:43,343
We're so grateful.

928
00:38:44,203 --> 00:38:46,148
And she always
just talks about

929
00:38:46,233 --> 00:38:48,875
you and Amelia
as being his parents.

930
00:38:48,961 --> 00:38:50,886
And she's right.

00:38:51,088 --> 00:38:52,433
<i>♪ Wind upon the water ♪</i>

932
00:38:52,573 --> 00:38:55,258

- <i>♪ What has been will not always be ♪</i>
- Yes, sweetheart.

939
00:39:13,733 --> 00:39:15,351

You know, not, like,
overdose mistakes,

946
00:39:27,679 --> 00:39:29,679
but, like...

947
00:39:30,113 --> 00:39:31,414
Breaking curfew.

948
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:32,909
Or, um,

949
00:39:32,994 --> 00:39:36,307
- crashing my dad's car into the fence.

Hey, do you mind?

975
00:41:01,477 --> 00:41:03,462
Why you didn't
answer the phone?
