So, Catherine sent for you,
too, huh?

50
00:01:55,665 --> 00:01:57,522
Told me she needed
a VIP consult.

51
00:01:57,587 --> 00:02:00,660
Yeah, and she needed
the smartest neuro God she knows.

52
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,825
General, but the same.

53
00:02:03,461 --> 00:02:05,307
Something to drink,
Dr. Koracick?

54
00:02:05,372 --> 00:02:07,686
Double espresso,
dash of cinnamon, lots of sugar.

55
00:02:07,783 --> 00:02:08,957
Of course.

56
00:02:17,322 --> 00:02:19,265
Aaah. Ah.

57
00:02:20,547 --> 00:02:21,786
I'm sure,
if you asked nicely,

58
00:02:21,851 --> 00:02:24,325
that flight attendant could
scrounge up a kickass sedative,

59
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:25,467
just knock you
right out.

60
00:02:25,532 --> 00:02:26,919
If you knew my history
on planes,

61
00:02:26,984 --> 00:02:28,637
you would not be
making jokes.

62
00:02:28,702 --> 00:02:30,708
So, what do you think
Catherine's got for us?

63
00:02:30,908 --> 00:02:32,802
Rock star
with a spinal schwannoma?

64
00:02:32,867 --> 00:02:35,286
Mm. Oh, please, we could
do that in our sleep.

65
00:02:35,805 --> 00:02:37,465
Chooramani technique?

66
00:02:37,976 --> 00:02:39,654
What... you know the
Chooramani technique, Dr. Grey?

67
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:40,740
You impress me.

68
00:02:40,805 --> 00:02:42,294
I dabbled in neuro
for a bit.

69
00:02:42,359 --> 00:02:43,911
What...
What made you give it up?

70
00:02:43,976 --> 00:02:45,427
I...

71
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:49,869
..could have possibly ruined
my husband's Alzheimer's trial.

72
00:02:49,934 --> 00:02:52,947
Oh.
I heard about that.

73
00:02:53,497 --> 00:02:54,955
Yeah, I met him
on the conference circuit.

74
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:57,033
He thought it was fitting
that my name had the word "ass"

75
00:02:57,098 --> 00:02:58,822
right smack
in the middle of it.

76
00:02:59,032 --> 00:03:00,433
- That sounds like him.
- Yeah.

77
00:03:00,498 --> 00:03:01,606
Oh.

78
00:03:03,864 --> 00:03:05,763
- We're next in line for takeoff.
- Mm.

79
00:03:05,828 --> 00:03:07,259
Don't forget
to buckle up.

80
00:03:10,783 --> 00:03:12,446
Do you want me to talk
or shut up?

81
00:03:12,723 --> 00:03:13,876
Talk.

82
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,427
Chief,
good, you're here.

83
00:03:18,492 --> 00:03:20,846
I haven't been the chief
in years, Frankie.

84
00:03:20,911 --> 00:03:22,533
You'll always be
my chief.

85
00:03:22,655 --> 00:03:24,393
Room 3 needs you.
Your intern doesn't know

86
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:25,799
a wound-vac
from his ass.

87
00:03:25,864 --> 00:03:28,602
And here I thought motherhood
would soften your edges.

88
00:03:28,702 --> 00:03:30,803
Who needs soft edges
when you're always right?

89
00:03:30,868 --> 00:03:31,955
You know,
when I hired you,

90
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,908
I knew you were gonna be nothing
but a pain in my...

91
00:03:33,973 --> 00:03:36,533
When you hired me, I was first
in my class at nursing school

92
00:03:36,598 --> 00:03:37,815
and knew my way
around a central line

93
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,510
better than anyone,
including you.

94
00:03:39,575 --> 00:03:40,611
Pain in my...

95
00:03:40,676 --> 00:03:41,807
Careful,
or I'm not gonna let you

96
00:03:41,872 --> 00:03:43,283
put money down
on baby names.

97
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:45,633
Ginger put that up, thinking
she could make a quick buck.

98
00:03:45,698 --> 00:03:47,986
She knows I'm just gonna wind up
calling it "Chicken."

99
00:03:48,273 --> 00:03:49,681
Or L'il Pancake.

100
00:03:49,748 --> 00:03:52,119
L'il Pancake is not a name.

101
00:03:52,248 --> 00:03:55,137
Now, Richard,
that's a name.

102
00:03:55,202 --> 00:03:57,260
- Very distinguished.
- Ah.

103
00:03:57,325 --> 00:04:00,020
- Wise.
- All right.

104
00:04:00,207 --> 00:04:01,241
Frankie?

105
00:04:01,328 --> 00:04:02,419
Aah!

106
00:04:02,535 --> 00:04:04,587
- Frankie.
- Aah! Aah!

107
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:06,236
Somebody get me
a gurney!

108
00:04:06,301 --> 00:04:07,379
Frankie?

109
00:04:07,457 --> 00:04:08,923
Okay, we got you.

111
00:04:19,952 --> 00:04:23,659
Have you had any other
symptoms... pain, dizziness?

112
00:04:23,811 --> 00:04:26,340
I'm 28 weeks' pregnant
at a crazy-ass job

113
00:04:26,405 --> 00:04:28,542
where people
feed me cupcakes all day.

114
00:04:28,707 --> 00:04:30,636
I just thought
it was indigestion.

115
00:04:30,717 --> 00:04:31,893
Aah-aah, damn it.

116
00:04:31,958 --> 00:04:33,115
Frankie.

117
00:04:33,288 --> 00:04:34,301
What do you need?

118
00:04:34,366 --> 00:04:35,735
No, I'm...

119
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:38,284
Dr. Webber's
just checking me out.

120
00:04:39,631 --> 00:04:42,167
Pulse is strong,
but she's tachycardic.

121
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,133
What are we thinking?

122
00:04:43,198 --> 00:04:45,521
Ginger.
Hi. Ginger.

123
00:04:45,586 --> 00:04:47,380
Over here. Hi.

124
00:04:47,822 --> 00:04:50,028
Richard is taking care
of me.

125
00:04:50,368 --> 00:04:52,236
Richard is good.

126
00:04:52,453 --> 00:04:53,958
We like Richard.

127
00:04:54,054 --> 00:04:55,261
So...

128
00:04:55,372 --> 00:04:58,747
- Stand down?
- It would be appreciated.

129
00:05:04,117 --> 00:05:06,357
You've got a hell
of a village there.

130
00:05:06,564 --> 00:05:10,599
My whole life, you know, I've had
an order in my head...

131
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,902
Job, dog, house...

132
00:05:13,969 --> 00:05:16,973
- Ring, husband, baby.
- Ring, husband, baby.

133
00:05:17,038 --> 00:05:18,438
Exactly.

134
00:05:18,569 --> 00:05:21,973
And I'm skating towards 40
with a killer job,

135
00:05:22,038 --> 00:05:25,560
but no ring,
no husband,

136
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:28,068
no human man in sight.

137
00:05:28,612 --> 00:05:30,553
So I made
my own damn order.

138
00:05:30,618 --> 00:05:34,146
And me and L'il Pancake
are gonna be a helluva team.

139
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:35,893
And we've got
our village.

140
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:38,364
L'il Pancake
is not a name.

141
00:05:39,736 --> 00:05:44,005
Well, I never saw a challenge
you couldn't rise to.

142
00:05:44,746 --> 00:05:47,271
And your baby has
a nice, strong heartbeat,

143
00:05:47,336 --> 00:05:48,633
just like we like it.

144
00:05:48,698 --> 00:05:51,007
So then...
Aah, damn it.

145
00:05:51,072 --> 00:05:52,183
What's wrong?

146
00:05:52,248 --> 00:05:54,185
Uh, it's your spleen.

147
00:05:54,509 --> 00:05:55,930
Where?

148
00:05:56,664 --> 00:05:57,664
There.

149
00:05:57,939 --> 00:06:00,545
It is
a wandering spleen.

150
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,137
It's torqued
around itself,

151
00:06:02,202 --> 00:06:04,422
and it's cutting off
the blood supply.

152
00:06:04,487 --> 00:06:06,646
So I'm gonna get you
up to the OR.

153
00:06:06,711 --> 00:06:07,973
No, no, no, no,
hold on.

154
00:06:08,038 --> 00:06:09,725
It could resolve
on its own.

155
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:11,093
Sometimes the spleen
turns itself

156
00:06:11,158 --> 00:06:12,615
- back around. No, it happened.
- Highly unlikely.

157
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,748
- I have seen it.
- It's possible, but, Frankie...

158
00:06:14,813 --> 00:06:18,029
At 28 weeks, the only way
to make sure

159
00:06:18,094 --> 00:06:19,974
that this baby stays
safely inside of me

160
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:21,857
is to stay
out of that OR.

161
00:06:21,943 --> 00:06:23,190
I...

162
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:24,624
Aah.

163
00:06:24,711 --> 00:06:26,253
I know the risks.

164
00:06:26,318 --> 00:06:27,347
I don't care.

165
00:06:27,412 --> 00:06:28,584
Frankie,
listen to me. I...

166
00:06:28,649 --> 00:06:31,192
$41,632.

167
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:33,720
That's what
this kid costs.

168
00:06:33,989 --> 00:06:36,447
Three rounds of IVF
and a miscarriage.

169
00:06:36,512 --> 00:06:39,494
I'm not telling you that
so you feel sorry for me.

170
00:06:39,559 --> 00:06:41,307
This baby
is worth every dime,

171
00:06:41,372 --> 00:06:42,809
all of it.

172
00:06:43,676 --> 00:06:46,572
I am telling you
because this is it.

173
00:06:47,322 --> 00:06:50,013
I literally have all of my eggs
in one basket,

174
00:06:50,078 --> 00:06:53,564
so there is no way
we are risking this.

175
00:06:53,748 --> 00:06:56,486
I'm not going.

176
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,626
Don't make me sic Ginger
on you.

177
00:07:06,723 --> 00:07:09,973
I'm gonna check you in.
I'm gonna watch you like a hawk.

178
00:07:10,038 --> 00:07:12,876
That part
we've got covered.

179
00:07:33,796 --> 00:07:36,020
I mean, we're always hoping
for the patient to be Bono,

180
00:07:36,085 --> 00:07:38,721
but at some point, the patient
has to actually be Bono, right?

181
00:07:38,786 --> 00:07:40,434
Well, I met him once.
Even his brain is cool.

182
00:07:40,499 --> 00:07:42,192
- It's annoying.
- What took you two so long?

183
00:07:42,257 --> 00:07:43,840
- Catherine, this place is gorgeous.
- The patient is

184
00:07:43,905 --> 00:07:45,434
a 65-year-old female.

185
00:07:45,499 --> 00:07:47,036
Susan Sarandon?
Helen Mirren?

186
00:07:47,101 --> 00:07:48,512
- Make my dreams come true.
- She's complained

187
00:07:48,577 --> 00:07:49,606
of neck and back pain

188
00:07:49,671 --> 00:07:51,161
off and on
for the past several weeks,

189
00:07:51,226 --> 00:07:54,060
and, yesterday,
the pain reached a fever pitch.

190
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:56,606
Head of Ortho
insisted on a C.T.

191
00:07:56,723 --> 00:07:58,809
It would be nice to have
a cervical MRI

192
00:07:58,874 --> 00:08:00,254
so we know
what we're dealing with.

193
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:01,333
Already done.

194
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:02,538
Okay.

195
00:08:06,282 --> 00:08:09,217
Oh, will you marry me?

196
00:08:09,282 --> 00:08:10,802
- Thomas, please.
- No, I'm not kidding.

197
00:08:10,867 --> 00:08:12,584
She is smart, wily.

198
00:08:12,649 --> 00:08:14,381
I mean, I have never seen
a tumor

199
00:08:14,446 --> 00:08:16,584
invade both the vascular
and the nerve domains

200
00:08:16,649 --> 00:08:17,662
like that before.

201
00:08:17,727 --> 00:08:18,911
Neither have I.

202
00:08:19,032 --> 00:08:20,701
I always thought a blonde
would take me off the market,

203
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:22,443
- but, spinal tumor...
- Tommy.

204
00:08:22,508 --> 00:08:23,810
- No, I'm just saying, this tumor is
- Tommy.

205
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:25,177
Not going
anywhere anytime soon.

206
00:08:25,242 --> 00:08:26,451
You know
I love my women stubborn.

207
00:08:26,516 --> 00:08:28,669
We're gonna need to do a biopsy
to determine

208
00:08:28,734 --> 00:08:30,724
- if it's cancer or not.
- Oh, cart, horse.

209
00:08:30,789 --> 00:08:32,177
Love the enthusiasm,
but, uh,

210
00:08:32,242 --> 00:08:33,593
I prefer to meet
the patient first.

211
00:08:33,658 --> 00:08:35,122
You already have.

212
00:08:35,365 --> 00:08:36,771
Sorry to disappoint you,
Thomas.

213
00:08:36,836 --> 00:08:39,247
No Hollywood movie stars
today.

214
00:08:41,468 --> 00:08:43,380
I'm the patient.

215
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:53,226
- Catherine, I'm sorry. I didn't...
- Don't apologize.

216
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:55,538
- I didn't...
- You meant every word you said.

217
00:08:55,741 --> 00:08:57,320
Look. Including the part
where we don't know

218
00:08:57,385 --> 00:08:58,702
if it's cancer or not.

219
00:08:58,767 --> 00:09:01,359
Are you having any numbness
or loss of motor function?

220
00:09:01,424 --> 00:09:04,679
No, just the pain, which is
why I need a biopsy right away.

221
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:05,789
I have things to do.

222
00:09:05,854 --> 00:09:07,553
I think a spinal tumor's
a pretty good reason

223
00:09:07,618 --> 00:09:08,816
to postpone
a ribbon cutting.

224
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:10,781
I didn't send for you
to postpone a damn thing.

225
00:09:10,846 --> 00:09:13,972
Catherine, why aren't Richard
and Jackson here?

226
00:09:14,037 --> 00:09:15,125
They don't know.

227
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:17,843
They will know
when there's something to know.

228
00:09:17,908 --> 00:09:19,473
Now, I've reserved
the IR suite.

229
00:09:19,538 --> 00:09:21,736
We can take care of the biopsy
right now.

230
00:09:22,626 --> 00:09:25,062
The tumor extends
into the sub-q area...

231
00:09:25,127 --> 00:09:26,347
Which makes it
my dance space.

232
00:09:26,412 --> 00:09:27,794
Well, just make sure
when you finish dancing,

233
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:30,114
I can still cut the ribbon
on this place.

234
00:09:34,322 --> 00:09:35,452
Icilda!

235
00:09:35,532 --> 00:09:36,445
Icilda?

236
00:09:36,523 --> 00:09:37,640
You better not make
that fun of that.

237
00:09:37,705 --> 00:09:39,280
That's my mama's name.

238
00:09:39,357 --> 00:09:42,656
Okay, I want Q two-hour
neuro checks on 3,

239
00:09:42,721 --> 00:09:44,172
and, Carla,
please make sure

240
00:09:44,237 --> 00:09:45,464
that Mrs. Chen
is double-gowned.

241
00:09:45,529 --> 00:09:47,007
That woman does
three laps a day

242
00:09:47,072 --> 00:09:48,531
with her rear
flapping in the breeze.

243
00:09:48,596 --> 00:09:49,726
- Yeah, she does.
- Yeah, she does.

244
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:51,518
Ahh...

245
00:09:52,662 --> 00:09:54,593
Now, the only way for you
to help me

246
00:09:54,658 --> 00:09:56,547
is to go do your jobs,
please.

247
00:09:56,612 --> 00:09:57,980
Yeah,
you heard the boss.

248
00:09:58,045 --> 00:09:59,288
Let's go.

249
00:10:01,572 --> 00:10:03,429
And so,
as the boss of you...

250
00:10:03,494 --> 00:10:04,445
Here he goes.

251
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:05,672
Um, you should be resting.

252
00:10:05,737 --> 00:10:07,223
Pulse has gone back down
to normal.

253
00:10:07,288 --> 00:10:08,726
Her blood pressure
is stable.

254
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:10,055
We checked it manually
twice.

255
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,609
We're not all just
trashy magazines

256
00:10:11,674 --> 00:10:12,656
and noise violations.

257
00:10:12,721 --> 00:10:14,183
She's good, Dr. Webber.

258
00:10:14,248 --> 00:10:15,674
Indeed.

259
00:10:15,952 --> 00:10:17,803
Now,
if you all don't mind,

260
00:10:17,868 --> 00:10:20,108
I'd like to do
a quick ultrasound.

261
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:22,106
How about some privacy?

262
00:10:22,843 --> 00:10:25,041
- We'll be outside.
- Yes.

263
00:10:25,372 --> 00:10:26,937
Don't you name that baby
before we come back.

264
00:10:27,002 --> 00:10:28,124
If you do,
you name it Alex.

265
00:10:28,189 --> 00:10:29,757
'Cause Alex goes
both ways.

266
00:10:29,822 --> 00:10:31,117
- Oh, my God. Go away.
- No, I can't.

267
00:10:31,182 --> 00:10:32,828
- What about Minty?
- Minty?

268
00:10:32,893 --> 00:10:34,772
- Minty would be beautiful.
- It's bad.

269
00:10:47,126 --> 00:10:48,241
They mean well.

270
00:10:48,306 --> 00:10:51,420
You're exactly the boss
I always knew you would be...

271
00:10:51,485 --> 00:10:53,100
Tough, fair.

272
00:10:53,165 --> 00:10:54,622
With a little bit
of flair.

273
00:10:54,687 --> 00:10:56,748
You always had that.

274
00:11:02,822 --> 00:11:04,204
Is that...

275
00:11:04,992 --> 00:11:06,412
I believe it is.

276
00:11:06,525 --> 00:11:08,436
Your spleen's beginning
to untwist.

277
00:11:08,536 --> 00:11:10,576
I can see blood
flowing again.

278
00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:15,269
You can say it, you know?
It won't kill you.

279
00:11:15,374 --> 00:11:17,532
You weren't wrong
for waiting a while.

280
00:11:17,623 --> 00:11:19,093
Oh, that's the best
you can do?

281
00:11:19,158 --> 00:11:20,384
For today.

282
00:11:21,162 --> 00:11:22,889
Hey, what gives?

283
00:11:23,593 --> 00:11:25,452
You're cranky.
Your jokes are stale.

284
00:11:25,517 --> 00:11:27,593
I could fly to Paris
with the bags under your eyes.

285
00:11:27,658 --> 00:11:30,217
If you weren't my patient,
I'd have you fired.

286
00:11:30,477 --> 00:11:32,131
How's Catherine?

287
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:35,311
She's busy,
traveling a lot.

288
00:11:36,032 --> 00:11:39,006
And Maggie? Meredith?

289
00:11:39,181 --> 00:11:41,264
Everybody's fine.

290
00:11:41,837 --> 00:11:44,276
Hey, I know it was hard
losing Ollie.

291
00:11:44,633 --> 00:11:45,847
Yeah, it was.

292
00:11:45,912 --> 00:11:48,076
I'll check on your vitals
in a bit.

293
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:56,433
You keep up
the good work,

294
00:11:56,498 --> 00:11:59,686
our girl may name
her baby Richard after all.

295
00:12:09,032 --> 00:12:10,446
You off today?

296
00:12:10,572 --> 00:12:13,163
Um, I wish. You?

297
00:12:13,228 --> 00:12:14,458
Sort of.

298
00:12:14,536 --> 00:12:16,741
I, um... I had a dream
last night

299
00:12:16,806 --> 00:12:18,504
about my rechargeable hearts...

300
00:12:18,664 --> 00:12:20,633
which I took as a sign
that I should go in today

301
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:22,677
and really focus on them,
which, you know,

302
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,171
now that I say that
out loud,

303
00:12:24,236 --> 00:12:26,446
that makes me the queen
of the science nerds.

304
00:12:27,896 --> 00:12:31,973
But I promise
we'll do dinner...

305
00:12:32,038 --> 00:12:34,763
A big, huge dinner...

306
00:12:34,828 --> 00:12:36,601
All the...

307
00:12:37,263 --> 00:12:38,587
wine.

308
00:12:39,952 --> 00:12:41,356
All the what, babe?

309
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:55,529
- Maggie, listen.
- Nope.

310
00:12:55,594 --> 00:12:57,846
- Maggie.
- No.

311
00:12:57,911 --> 00:12:59,736
Will you stop
for a second, please?

312
00:12:59,841 --> 00:13:01,244
Let me guess.

313
00:13:01,439 --> 00:13:02,633
"It's not
what it looks like.

314
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:04,276
We're just friends,
I promise."

315
00:13:04,341 --> 00:13:07,677
Um... Okay, yes, that was
what I was gonna say.

316
00:13:07,742 --> 00:13:08,927
This isn't funny,
Jackson.

317
00:13:08,992 --> 00:13:10,387
Maggie, it's what
I was gonna say

318
00:13:10,452 --> 00:13:11,799
because it's the truth,
all right?

319
00:13:11,864 --> 00:13:13,776
- I didn't cheat on you.
- You are too smart to say that,

320
00:13:13,841 --> 00:13:15,900
and I am too smart
to believe it.

321
00:13:15,998 --> 00:13:17,155
Ow.

322
00:13:17,242 --> 00:13:19,724
And now I cut my foot,
damn it!

323
00:13:19,789 --> 00:13:21,130
Just wait.

324
00:13:22,162 --> 00:13:23,776
Well, let's just forget
about the fact

325
00:13:23,841 --> 00:13:24,926
that you were going through
my phone.

326
00:13:24,991 --> 00:13:26,049
It kept dinging
over and over again,

327
00:13:26,114 --> 00:13:28,057
and I thought it was mine,
and that is not the point.

328
00:13:28,122 --> 00:13:31,026
The point is that some woman
is missing you

329
00:13:31,091 --> 00:13:32,307
with multiple heart emojis,

330
00:13:32,372 --> 00:13:33,547
and you won't tell me
the truth.

331
00:13:33,612 --> 00:13:34,594
Maggie,
you want the truth?

332
00:13:34,659 --> 00:13:35,873
Okay, all right?

333
00:13:35,938 --> 00:13:37,347
I... I met someone...

334
00:13:37,412 --> 00:13:38,427
You met someone.

335
00:13:38,492 --> 00:13:39,753
At... when I was at
the monastery.

336
00:13:39,818 --> 00:13:40,737
When you were
at the monastery.

337
00:13:40,802 --> 00:13:41,843
- Yeah.
- Why are you repeating?

338
00:13:41,908 --> 00:13:43,249
I don't know. I just am.
Keep going.

339
00:13:43,314 --> 00:13:44,437
All right, you have glass
in your foot.

340
00:13:44,502 --> 00:13:46,594
- Can we... I'm not...
- Don't change the subject.

341
00:13:48,872 --> 00:13:52,217
Her name is Kate, all right?
And... you were right.

342
00:13:52,282 --> 00:13:54,392
I think you were probably right
about the PTSD,

343
00:13:54,457 --> 00:13:57,079
and it's just there's something
about nature that,

344
00:13:57,144 --> 00:13:58,688
when you're unplugged
and unmoored

345
00:13:58,753 --> 00:14:00,631
and... you were right.

346
00:14:00,696 --> 00:14:02,485
So you slept with her
because you had God feelings?

347
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,621
What? No.

348
00:14:03,699 --> 00:14:04,720
I didn't sleep
with anybody.

349
00:14:04,785 --> 00:14:06,088
I didn't even kiss her.
It's...

350
00:14:06,153 --> 00:14:08,368
It's not about that at all.
We talked.

351
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:10,451
Maggie, we just talked
all night

352
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,103
about how she lost
her brother

353
00:14:12,168 --> 00:14:14,391
and... how she's looking
for some kind of peace.

354
00:14:14,456 --> 00:14:15,892
Which she found
in your pants?

355
00:14:15,957 --> 00:14:18,938
No. No. Maggie, no,
all right?

356
00:14:19,003 --> 00:14:19,938
You're bleeding,
all right?

357
00:14:20,003 --> 00:14:21,103
Will you just sit down
for a second

358
00:14:21,168 --> 00:14:22,093
so I can help you,
please?

359
00:14:22,158 --> 00:14:24,134
Please, okay?
I'll grab a first-aid kit,

360
00:14:24,199 --> 00:14:25,688
and you can just look
at the messages

361
00:14:25,753 --> 00:14:27,690
- yourself.
- Oh, no. I-I don't need to.

362
00:14:27,755 --> 00:14:28,891
I think you do, okay?

363
00:14:28,956 --> 00:14:31,376
This is not some puzzle
you need to solve, okay?

364
00:14:31,441 --> 00:14:32,454
Nothing happened.

365
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:33,751
I didn't want anything
to happen.

366
00:14:33,816 --> 00:14:35,048
She's just somebody
who understood

367
00:14:35,113 --> 00:14:37,805
what I was going through,
what I'd lost.

368
00:14:37,872 --> 00:14:39,743
And, honestly, she understood it
better than I did,

369
00:14:39,808 --> 00:14:41,000
and it helped.

370
00:14:41,072 --> 00:14:42,973
It helped to not feel so alone
in all this.

371
00:14:43,038 --> 00:14:44,594
Here. Come here.

372
00:14:46,191 --> 00:14:47,597
You're still talking
to her.

373
00:14:47,662 --> 00:14:49,282
Last week,
last couple of days,

374
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:50,524
when you were bringing me
takeout

375
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:51,847
and asking me
to trust you...

376
00:14:51,912 --> 00:14:53,485
Because you should.
You can trust me,

377
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:54,681
- okay?
- Jackson,

378
00:14:54,746 --> 00:14:56,537
my dating history
might be dubious,

379
00:14:56,602 --> 00:14:59,887
but I do know that no woman
in the history of ever

380
00:14:59,952 --> 00:15:01,730
sends "miss yous"
and heart emojis

381
00:15:01,795 --> 00:15:02,816
to men she doesn't want
to sleep with.

382
00:15:02,881 --> 00:15:04,847
That's not what this is,
Maggie, all right?

383
00:15:04,912 --> 00:15:06,345
I swear, okay?
We talked.

384
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:08,634
And it's just nice,
honestly,

385
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:11,607
to... talk to people who've been
through the same thing.

386
00:15:13,072 --> 00:15:14,466
People?

387
00:15:15,492 --> 00:15:18,612
I just...
I meant that, um...

388
00:15:19,029 --> 00:15:21,159
Who else
are you talking to?

389
00:15:21,656 --> 00:15:25,963
Just, um...
April sometimes.

390
00:15:33,282 --> 00:15:34,347
What happened?

391
00:15:34,412 --> 00:15:35,677
Her blood pressure tanked,

392
00:15:35,742 --> 00:15:37,823
and her pain level's
through the roof.

393
00:15:37,888 --> 00:15:39,206
What is happening?

394
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:40,863
It's gonna be okay.
My baby.

395
00:15:40,928 --> 00:15:42,340
Okay,
let's take a look.

396
00:15:42,405 --> 00:15:44,956
- Your baby looks strong.
- Mnh.

397
00:15:45,115 --> 00:15:46,325
Damn it.

398
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:47,434
There's fluid
in her abdomen.

399
00:15:47,499 --> 00:15:48,717
It's likely blood.

400
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:50,766
Her splenic artery
probably burst, okay?

401
00:15:50,831 --> 00:15:52,019
I'll go tell them
to prep an OR.

402
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:53,860
And shut down
the gallery.

403
00:15:54,124 --> 00:15:57,014
You page Alex Karev
and the head of OB, stat.

404
00:15:57,079 --> 00:15:58,223
- If we have to take this baby out...
- Aah!

405
00:15:58,288 --> 00:15:59,795
I want the best on-hand,
okay, all right?

406
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,831
Wait, no.
Please, no, please.

407
00:16:01,896 --> 00:16:03,933
- Please...
- Listen to me, Frankie.

408
00:16:03,998 --> 00:16:06,717
There is nothing
you can't handle, okay?

409
00:16:06,782 --> 00:16:09,252
Come on, let's go.
Come on. We got to move.

410
00:16:13,782 --> 00:16:15,371
Do you think
it's cancer?

411
00:16:15,436 --> 00:16:18,940
Dr. Grey, that's why
we're doing the biopsy.

412
00:16:19,368 --> 00:16:20,752
Actual answers.

413
00:16:21,038 --> 00:16:22,075
Science.

414
00:16:22,162 --> 00:16:23,973
I'm asking
if you have a feeling.

415
00:16:24,038 --> 00:16:25,690
I am a Big Gun.

416
00:16:25,755 --> 00:16:26,831
Yes, I know.

417
00:16:26,896 --> 00:16:28,323
You're amazing,
incredible.

418
00:16:28,388 --> 00:16:29,706
There's no one in the world
like you.

419
00:16:29,771 --> 00:16:32,151
- I get it.
- I feel so seen.

420
00:16:32,216 --> 00:16:33,781
Thank you.

421
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:36,979
And we are ready
to roll.

422
00:16:37,202 --> 00:16:38,763
Okay, now, you want
to be careful

423
00:16:38,828 --> 00:16:39,941
- because you...
- Grey...

424
00:16:40,006 --> 00:16:41,472
you're not gonna
backseat drive

425
00:16:41,537 --> 00:16:42,870
a simple biopsy,
are you?

426
00:16:42,935 --> 00:16:44,777
- Nope.
- No? Good.

427
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:49,553
Be careful because...
Da, da, no, no, no, no.

428
00:16:49,618 --> 00:16:50,800
No, no.

429
00:16:50,878 --> 00:16:53,516
People don't come
to The Meredith Grey

430
00:16:53,581 --> 00:16:56,289
for appys and choles anymore,
do they?

431
00:16:56,878 --> 00:16:58,680
No, they don't.

432
00:16:59,784 --> 00:17:03,140
You... are a Big Gun.

433
00:17:03,253 --> 00:17:06,820
You spend your days
with the worst-case scenarios.

434
00:17:07,203 --> 00:17:11,053
You are the last stop
on the Hope Train,

435
00:17:11,118 --> 00:17:15,407
and if you felt that
every hour of every day,

436
00:17:15,472 --> 00:17:17,984
well, you'd be
a miserable first date.

437
00:17:18,049 --> 00:17:20,877
Big Guns worry when there's
something to worry about.

438
00:17:20,952 --> 00:17:22,707
- Put a rush on that.
- Put a rush on that.

439
00:17:27,282 --> 00:17:29,013
Hey, the nurses
are lining the halls.

440
00:17:29,078 --> 00:17:29,934
Can I help?

441
00:17:29,999 --> 00:17:31,257
Yeah. Get in here.

442
00:17:31,322 --> 00:17:32,887
We need to get
this spleen out.

443
00:17:32,952 --> 00:17:35,303
She's hypotensive.
We need to take the baby out.

444
00:17:35,368 --> 00:17:37,007
The baby's only 28 weeks.

445
00:17:37,072 --> 00:17:39,097
You're talking months
in the NICU

446
00:17:39,162 --> 00:17:41,393
and a potential lifetime
of deficits.

447
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:43,664
- Dr. Webber...
- My judgment is not clouded.

448
00:17:43,998 --> 00:17:45,284
Suction.

449
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:48,266
The nurses in our hospital put
their own needs...

450
00:17:48,331 --> 00:17:51,969
their own lives aside
every hour of every day

451
00:17:52,034 --> 00:17:53,223
for the good
of their patients.

452
00:17:53,288 --> 00:17:54,573
Clamp.

453
00:17:55,821 --> 00:17:59,415
So I owe it to them
to do everything in my power

454
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:02,367
to keep that baby
right where he belongs.

455
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,058
Okay, retract back.

456
00:18:05,124 --> 00:18:06,719
Okay, scissors.

457
00:18:06,788 --> 00:18:08,241
Thank you.

458
00:18:09,572 --> 00:18:11,776
More. Good.

459
00:18:16,204 --> 00:18:18,625
There. It's out.

460
00:18:18,822 --> 00:18:20,719
And the bleeding's
under control.

461
00:18:21,078 --> 00:18:22,102
Well done, sir.

462
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:23,472
Thank you.

463
00:18:25,529 --> 00:18:26,982
Damn it!

464
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,652
Is your vascular clamp
still in place?

465
00:18:28,717 --> 00:18:30,659
Maybe it's
the short gastric arteries.

466
00:18:30,782 --> 00:18:32,282
Her pressure's tanking.

467
00:18:32,347 --> 00:18:33,789
Okay. Suction.

468
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:35,128
Right.

469
00:18:35,464 --> 00:18:36,735
There's too much blood.

470
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,570
I can't tell
where it's coming from.

471
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,649
Dr. Webber,
baby's in distress.

472
00:18:40,714 --> 00:18:42,789
Sir, we need to
get this baby out now.

473
00:18:43,073 --> 00:18:44,271
Dr. Webber.

474
00:18:48,141 --> 00:18:49,313
Then do it.

475
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:50,611
Some pads.

476
00:19:00,648 --> 00:19:01,469
Baby's out.

477
00:19:01,534 --> 00:19:04,375
Okay, where the hell is
all this blood coming from?

478
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:06,053
I need suction
and intubation, stat.

479
00:19:06,118 --> 00:19:07,821
Oh, she's
going into DIC.

480
00:19:07,886 --> 00:19:09,789
Let's hang FFP.

481
00:19:10,341 --> 00:19:12,508
Karev,
how you doing over there?

482
00:19:13,705 --> 00:19:15,334
Karev?

483
00:19:17,644 --> 00:19:18,665
Karev!

484
00:19:18,743 --> 00:19:21,490
Got an airway,
but no movement.

485
00:19:22,405 --> 00:19:25,156
Come on, buddy. Come on,
come on, come on, come on.

486
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:27,776
We got movement!
We got it.

487
00:19:28,011 --> 00:19:29,851
Sats are improving.

488
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:32,435
We got him.
We're good.

489
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,642
Did you hear that,
Frankie?

490
00:19:33,707 --> 00:19:35,417
Your baby boy's okay.
He's okay.

491
00:19:35,482 --> 00:19:37,283
I need you to stay
with him.

492
00:19:38,147 --> 00:19:39,160
We need that crash cart!

493
00:19:39,225 --> 00:19:41,291
Get him in the NICU now,
stat.

494
00:19:45,505 --> 00:19:47,166
Let's charge to 120.

495
00:19:50,677 --> 00:19:51,778
Clear.

496
00:19:55,655 --> 00:19:58,393
Come on, Frankie.
Come on. Come on.

497
00:19:58,648 --> 00:20:00,238
Let's charge to 200.

498
00:20:01,096 --> 00:20:02,096
Clear.

499
00:20:06,497 --> 00:20:10,621
I thought it would be me
detonating this...

500
00:20:11,881 --> 00:20:13,133
whatever this is.

501
00:20:13,198 --> 00:20:15,223
I thought
it would be me.

502
00:20:15,822 --> 00:20:17,473
Not out of ego
or anything...

503
00:20:17,538 --> 00:20:20,480
Just, you know, history.

504
00:20:20,609 --> 00:20:22,699
I thought I would be
the reason.

505
00:20:28,354 --> 00:20:31,733
So you pictured
us ending?

506
00:20:33,242 --> 00:20:35,027
- You didn't?
- No.

507
00:20:36,456 --> 00:20:37,922
Did you picture it
with April?

508
00:20:37,987 --> 00:20:41,347
No, I didn't picture
my marriage ending.

509
00:20:41,412 --> 00:20:42,484
Maybe it didn't.

510
00:20:42,549 --> 00:20:43,610
Come on.

511
00:20:43,688 --> 00:20:45,484
Are you really threatened
by April?

512
00:20:45,549 --> 00:20:47,547
Jackson, you're texting
other women.

513
00:20:47,612 --> 00:20:48,781
You're talking
to other women,

514
00:20:48,846 --> 00:20:50,414
one of whom you used
to sleep with

515
00:20:50,479 --> 00:20:53,297
and the other who clearly wants
to sleep with you,

516
00:20:53,362 --> 00:20:55,803
and you are telling them things
that you don't tell me.

517
00:20:55,868 --> 00:20:58,187
Do you want to know why
I'm not telling you things

518
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:02,827
about God
or how I fit in this universe?

519
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,554
Or about things
I used to know

520
00:21:04,619 --> 00:21:06,250
that I don't seem to know
anymore?

521
00:21:06,315 --> 00:21:07,467
Because you don't...

522
00:21:07,532 --> 00:21:09,047
'Cause you won't talk
to me.

523
00:21:09,112 --> 00:21:11,695
I told you that God and religion
is not my thing,

524
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,053
but I-I support you.

525
00:21:13,118 --> 00:21:14,770
No, Maggie.

526
00:21:14,885 --> 00:21:18,554
You don't talk to me,
you know,

527
00:21:18,619 --> 00:21:21,054
and not about just your day
or rechargeable hearts

528
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:23,523
or how Mer's being a pain
in the ass today.

529
00:21:23,588 --> 00:21:26,890
I... I mean, I never know a
damn thing you're feeling.

530
00:21:26,955 --> 00:21:28,648
I am an amazing friend.

531
00:21:28,713 --> 00:21:30,039
I am an amazing sister.

532
00:21:30,104 --> 00:21:31,875
I am there for them
through every crisis.

533
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:33,507
Hell, I have been there
for you.

534
00:21:33,572 --> 00:21:35,026
Yes, you have been.

535
00:21:35,135 --> 00:21:36,646
You have been.

536
00:21:36,791 --> 00:21:38,647
It's not the same.

537
00:21:40,274 --> 00:21:42,914
So, because I'm not spewing
my feelings all over the place,

538
00:21:42,979 --> 00:21:44,973
that makes it okay for you
to hide in your phone

539
00:21:45,038 --> 00:21:46,527
with other women?

540
00:21:48,072 --> 00:21:50,763
You run every time
it gets complicated, Maggie.

541
00:21:50,828 --> 00:21:53,382
You hide in your lab,

542
00:21:53,447 --> 00:21:55,531
or you go off
and buy some milk

543
00:21:55,596 --> 00:21:56,679
instead of just having
an actual

544
00:21:56,744 --> 00:21:57,742
- conversation with me.
- That's not fair.

545
00:21:57,807 --> 00:21:59,695
You plan the end
of a relationship

546
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,117
when it's barely begun.

547
00:22:01,182 --> 00:22:02,647
What is that?

548
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:08,233
When's the last time
you let me in at all?

549
00:22:09,072 --> 00:22:10,749
Like, about anything?

550
00:22:11,088 --> 00:22:14,393
So you went and you got it
from someone else?

551
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:15,741
Maggie.

552
00:22:15,908 --> 00:22:17,166
Yeah.

553
00:22:18,144 --> 00:22:19,211
I find it a little easier

554
00:22:19,276 --> 00:22:21,147
to open up to people
who open up to me.

555
00:22:25,755 --> 00:22:29,179

556
00:22:29,362 --> 00:22:31,188

563
00:22:57,199 --> 00:23:00,430
over sacral nerve implants
back in the day.

564
00:23:00,984 --> 00:23:05,467
- So, how did I do?
- Oh, you were perfect.

565
00:23:05,532 --> 00:23:07,697
Just like
a professional patient.

566
00:23:07,762 --> 00:23:09,142
We're still waiting
on the results.

567
00:23:09,207 --> 00:23:10,465
Mm.

568
00:23:10,586 --> 00:23:13,315
Catherine?
Can I call Richard now?

569
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:16,528

I think I need a real drink.

Dr. Webber,
she's been down.

573
00:23:29,782 --> 00:23:30,945

00:23:35,377 --> 00:23:36,716

Hi.
I'm Gina. I'm an alcoholic.

592
00:25:16,248 --> 00:25:18,326
- Hi, Gina.
- Hi, Gina.

593
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:21,224
I lost my job busing for
the school district last week.

594
00:25:21,289 --> 00:25:23,669
Budget cuts.
I couldn't believe it.

595
00:25:23,734 --> 00:25:25,099
Haven't seen you around
in a while.

596
00:25:25,164 --> 00:25:26,740
I thought I...
I thought I was getting a raise.

597
00:25:26,805 --> 00:25:27,906
Work.

598
00:25:28,047 --> 00:25:29,448
Glad you're back.

599
00:25:29,758 --> 00:25:31,068
I grabbed my last paycheck,

600
00:25:31,133 --> 00:25:35,044
and every bone in my body
told me, "Call your sponsor."

601
00:25:35,531 --> 00:25:37,701
But I thought,
"I'll just walk it off.

602
00:25:37,766 --> 00:25:39,083
I'll just walk it
the hell off,"

603
00:25:39,148 --> 00:25:42,365
like... being a drunk
is like being in a bad mood

604
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:45,051
or trying to lose
a few pounds.

605
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:49,622
I pass by this bar, McGovern's,
right off Main,

606
00:25:49,687 --> 00:25:52,286
and I see this crappy
little sign in the window,

607
00:25:52,351 --> 00:25:54,294
hung up
with masking tape.

608
00:25:56,297 --> 00:25:58,184
"Chips for Shots."

609
00:25:58,601 --> 00:26:01,989
And at first, I...
I didn't know what it meant.

610
00:26:02,897 --> 00:26:05,573
And then I see the emblem.

611
00:26:06,412 --> 00:26:08,175
You give 'em your chip,
and they give you a shot

612
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,026
for every year
you're sober.

613
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,496
I wish I could have felt the way
that you feel right now...

614
00:26:15,561 --> 00:26:18,143
angry, horrified.

615
00:26:18,489 --> 00:26:21,957
But all I could feel
in that moment was lucky,

616
00:26:22,022 --> 00:26:24,214
because I have four years
under my belt

617
00:26:24,279 --> 00:26:26,925
and I got 4 bucks
in my bank account.

618
00:26:29,474 --> 00:26:30,912
Had.

619
00:26:31,373 --> 00:26:33,106
I had four years.

620
00:26:34,757 --> 00:26:36,740
God, I'm so ashamed.

621
00:26:37,032 --> 00:26:38,505
But I'm back,

622
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:41,887
and I got 24 hours
under my belt,

623
00:26:42,092 --> 00:26:43,950
and I am grateful.

624
00:26:52,872 --> 00:26:55,759
Okay, run it down for me.

625
00:26:55,824 --> 00:26:57,088
Look,
the results aren't in yet.

626
00:26:57,153 --> 00:26:58,447
The tumor
could still be benign,

627
00:26:58,512 --> 00:26:59,869
- so let's not worry about that until...
- Why do we do that?

628
00:26:59,934 --> 00:27:02,307
Why do we refuse
to talk about it?

629
00:27:02,372 --> 00:27:03,430
If I have cancer...

630
00:27:03,495 --> 00:27:05,524
- We don't know that you do.
- Yeah, but I might,

631
00:27:05,589 --> 00:27:07,830
and your tip-toeing around it
doesn't make it any better.

632
00:27:07,895 --> 00:27:09,470
- Can I get you guys something?
- Andrew, yes.

633
00:27:09,535 --> 00:27:10,923
What are you having,
Tommy?

634
00:27:10,988 --> 00:27:12,257
The sun is still out.

635
00:27:12,322 --> 00:27:14,633
Oh, he'll have the same
as me... tequila, neat.

636
00:27:14,698 --> 00:27:16,313
Make his a double.
Meredith?

637
00:27:16,378 --> 00:27:18,289
I'll have the same.

638
00:27:18,998 --> 00:27:20,425
Mm.

639
00:27:22,082 --> 00:27:23,411
Thanks.

640
00:27:23,916 --> 00:27:24,972
So...

641
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:27,907
Do you think, if you talk
about it, it'll scare me?

642
00:27:27,972 --> 00:27:29,313
It'll remind me?

643
00:27:29,378 --> 00:27:31,843
Do you think there's any world
where I'm not sitting here

644
00:27:31,908 --> 00:27:33,827
wondering
if my right foot is numb

645
00:27:33,892 --> 00:27:35,198
because of the heels

646
00:27:35,263 --> 00:27:37,836
or the tumor
snaking down my spine?

647
00:27:37,912 --> 00:27:39,263
Do you think
I'm sitting here now

648
00:27:39,328 --> 00:27:40,868
wondering,
"How long is it gonna be

649
00:27:40,933 --> 00:27:43,133
before they tack
the word 'Memorial'

650
00:27:43,198 --> 00:27:44,852
at the end
of that sign?"

651
00:27:45,563 --> 00:27:48,321
After all these years,
I have built a legacy

652
00:27:48,386 --> 00:27:50,992
that finally has
my own name on it.

653
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:52,634
I have a granddaughter

654
00:27:52,699 --> 00:27:54,784
that I want to watch
take over the world.

655
00:27:54,849 --> 00:27:59,627
You don't think I'm sitting here
wondering if I'll get to?

656
00:27:59,855 --> 00:28:02,805
There is nothing
you could possibly say

657
00:28:03,322 --> 00:28:05,433
that's worse than what
I've been imagining

658
00:28:05,498 --> 00:28:08,289
since the second
I saw those scans.

659
00:28:11,419 --> 00:28:12,884
Well, if it is cancer,

660
00:28:12,949 --> 00:28:15,860
we are looking at, um...

661
00:28:16,367 --> 00:28:19,414
osteosarcoma
or a chondrosarcoma.

662
00:28:19,498 --> 00:28:21,078
Which means what?

663
00:28:21,452 --> 00:28:24,470
If it's osteo,
assuming it has not spread,

664
00:28:24,535 --> 00:28:27,053
we are looking at chemo
and radiation

665
00:28:27,118 --> 00:28:28,910
to shrink the size
of the tumor

666
00:28:28,975 --> 00:28:32,549
and operate with as little
chance of paralysis as possible.

667
00:28:32,631 --> 00:28:34,783
And if it's
chondrosarcoma?

668
00:28:34,848 --> 00:28:37,789
Chondro is a beast.

669
00:28:38,162 --> 00:28:39,548
Doesn't respond
to chemo.

670
00:28:39,613 --> 00:28:43,469
So, if you're lucky...
And that's a big if...

671
00:28:43,782 --> 00:28:45,843
We may be able to cut it out
without, uh...

672
00:28:45,908 --> 00:28:47,282
Making me a quadriplegic,

673
00:28:47,347 --> 00:28:50,922
which means
I'll never operate again.

674
00:28:51,303 --> 00:28:54,142
Okay. So that tequila went
right through me.

675
00:28:54,207 --> 00:28:56,356
I got to go see a man
about a horse.

676
00:28:58,545 --> 00:29:02,573
Dr. Grey, you are among
the finest surgeons

677
00:29:02,742 --> 00:29:04,617
that I've seen
in my career.

678
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:07,087
But that's not the only reason
I called you here.

679
00:29:07,152 --> 00:29:09,782
When I look
in Richard's eyes,

680
00:29:10,742 --> 00:29:12,857
he's barely holding on.

681
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:17,680
His sponsor died,
and he hasn't replaced her,

682
00:29:18,121 --> 00:29:19,556
and if I tell him this...

683
00:29:19,621 --> 00:29:20,847
Catherine.

684
00:29:21,287 --> 00:29:24,047
My mother
hid her diagnosis

685
00:29:24,212 --> 00:29:27,206
and spent years alone
because of it.

686
00:29:27,402 --> 00:29:29,366
This is not an excuse

687
00:29:29,431 --> 00:29:31,845
to cut the people you love
out of your life.

688
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:35,462
Meredith, I don't know
if he can handle this.

689
00:29:35,527 --> 00:29:37,805
Well, I don't know
if he can handle it, either,

690
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:39,649
but it's his life, too.

691
00:29:39,733 --> 00:29:43,571
This is not your choice
to make for him.

692
00:29:44,281 --> 00:29:46,110
All right,
the hospital, uh, paged.

693
00:29:46,175 --> 00:29:48,821
The biopsy results
are back.

694
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:51,828
Okay, well...

695
00:29:53,144 --> 00:29:54,930
- Let's do this.
- Yeah.

696
00:29:55,566 --> 00:29:56,991
One more?

697
00:30:11,032 --> 00:30:12,442
That's good.

698
00:30:12,578 --> 00:30:15,534
I'm okay, thanks.

699
00:30:18,791 --> 00:30:21,589
When you went on your...
Your whole GodQuest...

700
00:30:21,662 --> 00:30:23,280
GodQuest?

701
00:30:24,414 --> 00:30:26,722
It's what I called it
in my head.

702
00:30:27,287 --> 00:30:30,440
When you left
without telling me, um...

703
00:30:33,905 --> 00:30:35,917
A part of me was relieved.

704
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:39,605
This tiny part of me...
exhaled

705
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:40,785
'cause I thought
you would...

706
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:41,769
You would go to the woods,

707
00:30:41,834 --> 00:30:43,566
and you would,
you know,

708
00:30:43,631 --> 00:30:45,027
talk to a priest
or a shaman,

709
00:30:45,092 --> 00:30:48,933
and... and... and pray
to something or someone,

710
00:30:48,998 --> 00:30:51,471
and you would come back
with some answers.

711
00:30:51,536 --> 00:30:53,729
You would come back
like yourself.

712
00:30:53,818 --> 00:30:58,127
But, instead, I came back
with more questions.

713
00:30:58,341 --> 00:31:01,080
And you took those questions
to other women.

714
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,068
Uh...

715
00:31:06,999 --> 00:31:09,449
I've spent most of my life

716
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:11,776
being five steps
ahead of everyone else,

717
00:31:11,841 --> 00:31:15,150
and nobody wants to be friends
with that girl, okay?

718
00:31:15,332 --> 00:31:17,723
That girl does not have
any dates or fights.

719
00:31:17,788 --> 00:31:20,315
She doesn't learn
how to fight.

720
00:31:21,771 --> 00:31:23,557
I learned calculus
in grade school.

721
00:31:23,622 --> 00:31:28,446
I learned
coronary bypass when I was 20.

722
00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:34,706
I never learned
how to really love or fight

723
00:31:34,771 --> 00:31:37,323
or really let somebody in
without it feeling like

724
00:31:37,388 --> 00:31:39,455
it was gonna be the end
of the world.

725
00:31:40,755 --> 00:31:44,667
And you have been married
and divorced,

726
00:31:44,732 --> 00:31:47,862
and you have a child,

727
00:31:47,927 --> 00:31:50,432
and
you've lost a child,

728
00:31:50,497 --> 00:31:53,479
and you are...
five steps ahead of me.

729
00:31:53,544 --> 00:31:57,213
And I... don't know
how to catch up.

730
00:32:04,387 --> 00:32:05,796
Um...

731
00:32:10,461 --> 00:32:14,664

She's happy

747
00:33:01,941 --> 00:33:03,869
You said
that you were happy for her.

748
00:33:03,934 --> 00:33:06,220
You said that
a lot of times.

749

I am.
I am happy for her.

750
00:33:07,748 --> 00:33:10,486
I would never do anything

776
00:35:13,562 --> 00:35:15,270

right?

778
00:35:26,243 --> 00:35:27,327

779
00:35:27,392 --> 00:35:28,685

00:36:18,869 --> 00:36:20,415

what you do to people,

791

This foundation was created

812
00:37:37,692 --> 00:37:39,739
to change the face
of medicine.

813
00:37:39,936 --> 00:37:42,716
And because of the brave women
who came forward

814
00:37:42,781 --> 00:37:48,270
and told their truths and
overcame insurmountable odds,

815
00:37:48,437 --> 00:37:50,435
the Catherine Fox Foundation

816
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:53,950
will change the face of medicine
once again.

817
00:37:54,929 --> 00:37:56,934
This is just the beginning.

818
00:37:59,836 --> 00:38:01,235
Damn.

819
00:38:01,508 --> 00:38:02,525
Right?

820
00:38:02,875 --> 00:38:05,940
No, I mean,
she looks good.

821
00:38:06,265 --> 00:38:07,568
She always
looked fantastic, but...

822
00:38:07,633 --> 00:38:09,097
Okay,
what is it with you two?

823
00:38:09,162 --> 00:38:11,443
Because you realize that
Richard and I are like family,

824
00:38:11,508 --> 00:38:13,325
so if there's something
going on...

825
00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:14,786
I'm not one
to kiss and tell.

826
00:38:14,851 --> 00:38:16,388
That's literally
all you ever do.

827
00:38:16,453 --> 00:38:17,943
Oh, you want...
You want details.

828
00:38:18,008 --> 00:38:20,200
- No, I don't.
- She woke me up.

829
00:38:22,609 --> 00:38:25,559
I had a kid, a son,
and, uh...

830
00:38:26,437 --> 00:38:27,498
then I didn't.

831
00:38:27,563 --> 00:38:30,903
Uh, I sleep-walked
through years of my life,

832
00:38:30,968 --> 00:38:34,653
and Catherine, uh...

833
00:38:35,336 --> 00:38:37,512
reminded me
that I was alive.

834
00:38:38,782 --> 00:38:41,668
And she sings
a mean harmony, too.

835
00:38:43,673 --> 00:38:45,239
She's my friend.

836
00:38:45,771 --> 00:38:47,214
Then she's in good hands.

837
00:38:47,279 --> 00:38:49,815
No, I'm a Big Gun,
Meredith.

838
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,526
Yeah, okay,
with the Big Gun.

839
00:38:51,591 --> 00:38:53,440
- I get it.
- No, you don't. You don't.

840
00:38:53,505 --> 00:38:55,753
There is no one smarter,
no one better than me.

841
00:38:55,818 --> 00:38:59,940
And my friend
has Grade 3 chondrosarcoma.

842
00:39:00,176 --> 00:39:03,464
She has cancer in her spine
that won't shrink with chemo,

843
00:39:03,529 --> 00:39:05,097
and I have no idea
how to remove it

844
00:39:05,162 --> 00:39:06,533
without killing
or paralyzing her.

845
00:39:06,598 --> 00:39:07,924
Thomas, what the hell
are you doing

846
00:39:07,989 --> 00:39:10,089
- Ugh. Catherine...
- standing here? You have work to do.

847
00:39:10,154 --> 00:39:11,464
I survived losing my mother

848
00:39:11,529 --> 00:39:12,989
before I could even
get to know her

849
00:39:13,054 --> 00:39:15,333
and my father, who dropped dead
on his way to church

850
00:39:15,398 --> 00:39:16,622
when I was 18 years old.

851
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:19,606
I raised my sisters alone...
No help, no money.

852
00:39:19,757 --> 00:39:23,020
I have survived racism, sexism,
every "ism"

853
00:39:23,085 --> 00:39:26,660
designed to make me feel small
or make me less.

854
00:39:26,757 --> 00:39:30,152
If I can do all of that,
if I can survive all of that,

855
00:39:30,492 --> 00:39:33,194
then I just might
survive this, too.

856
00:39:33,436 --> 00:39:36,316
But I can't do this
on my own.

857
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:37,629
