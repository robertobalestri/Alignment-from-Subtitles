I cannot change,

15
00:00:51,761 --> 00:00:54,962
the courage to change
the things I can,

16
00:00:55,251 --> 00:00:57,212

to know the difference.

00:01:05,775 --> 00:01:07,595
Oh. Damn it.

22
00:01:07,681 --> 00:01:09,093
If any patients
see you like that,

23
00:01:09,178 --> 00:01:10,595
they might go
to another hospital.

24
00:01:10,681 --> 00:01:11,698
Always gets me
in the mood.

25
00:01:11,783 --> 00:01:13,335
Plus, you know, I'm seeing
what daylight feels like

26
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:14,501
while I still can.

27
00:01:14,876 --> 00:01:15,931
How's Catherine?

28
00:01:16,017 --> 00:01:17,032
She's ready.

29
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:18,657
- And you?
- Shh, shh, shh, shh.

30
00:01:20,469 --> 00:01:21,923
Ah.

31
00:01:22,091 --> 00:01:24,658
Funny bone.
Not as easy as it looks.

32
00:01:26,626 --> 00:01:28,743
Okay, then.
I have real patients,

33
00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:31,376
so, you know,
good luck with... all this.

34
00:01:34,523 --> 00:01:35,868
I'm messing with you.

35
00:01:36,556 --> 00:01:39,357
You're gonna do great.
You and Amelia.

36
00:01:39,442 --> 00:01:41,559
You're ready.

37
00:01:41,644 --> 00:01:42,693
Charley horse.

38
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:52,399
There he is.
Thought you might need this.

39
00:01:52,485 --> 00:01:54,798
Oh. No, thanks.
But I'm... I'm good.

40
00:01:54,884 --> 00:01:56,574
I'm running late
for Catherine's scans.

41
00:01:56,659 --> 00:01:58,393
Okay, well, I have cleared
all my surgeries today

42
00:01:58,478 --> 00:01:59,454
and shored up child care,

43
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:00,713
so I'm here for you,
whatever you need,

44
00:02:00,798 --> 00:02:02,962
- whenever you need it.
- Like I said, I'm good.

45
00:02:03,493 --> 00:02:06,048
Okay, Richard,
it's gonna be a very long day.

46
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:09,387
Look, Meredith,
I have plenty of doctors

47
00:02:09,472 --> 00:02:11,368
and plenty of friends
looking out for me.

48
00:02:11,571 --> 00:02:14,243
You know who doesn't?
Your father.

49
00:02:14,859 --> 00:02:17,243
Molly had to get back to Bahrain
with her kids.

50
00:02:17,329 --> 00:02:18,407
He's all alone.

51
00:02:18,493 --> 00:02:20,665
And I will make time
to see Thatcher this week,

52
00:02:20,751 --> 00:02:22,743
but today is all
about you and Catherine.

53
00:02:22,844 --> 00:02:24,665
Meredith, Thatcher may not
have a week.

54
00:02:25,634 --> 00:02:27,900
Now, I know it's never been easy
between you two,

55
00:02:28,086 --> 00:02:30,203
but the time to change that
is running out.

56
00:02:31,814 --> 00:02:33,189
Excuse me.

Oh, I'm sorry
I missed your scan.

63
00:02:49,779 --> 00:02:52,634
Oh, please.
I went in. I came out.

64
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:54,524
Same as the first
million times.

65
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:56,196
Well, I could have
been there for you.

66
00:02:56,282 --> 00:02:58,173
You had a good excuse.

67
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:00,771
There's my girl!

68
00:03:00,856 --> 00:03:03,975
There's my girl!

69
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,543
Let me get her for you.
Relax.

70
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:07,634
Do you want to go
to Grandma?

71
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,481
Say, "Hi, Grandma."
"Hi, Grandma."

72
00:03:10,566 --> 00:03:12,483
Hey!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

73
00:03:12,568 --> 00:03:14,485
Did Koracick re-check
the CT angio?

74
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,487
Yes,
and please stop.

75
00:03:16,572 --> 00:03:18,604
I appreciate both of you
wanting to be a part of this,

76
00:03:18,689 --> 00:03:20,892
but I have
a crackerjack neuro team.

77
00:03:20,977 --> 00:03:23,306
I need you to be my husband
and my son today.

78
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,595
And
we need you to be our patient.

79
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:28,971
Hmm, Thomas, you're getting
ready to cut open my spine.

80
00:03:29,056 --> 00:03:30,835
I will be
whatever I want.

81
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,637
Oh. Music to my ears.

82
00:03:32,722 --> 00:03:35,033
Now, we will go in
posteriorly

83
00:03:35,119 --> 00:03:36,126
with our stealth system

84
00:03:36,235 --> 00:03:38,345
and our newly pilfered
ORBEYE scope.

85
00:03:38,431 --> 00:03:39,462
Hmm.

86
00:03:39,548 --> 00:03:41,900
The plan is to go in
and remove it en bloc.

87
00:03:41,986 --> 00:03:43,548
And you really think
that posteriorly

88
00:03:43,634 --> 00:03:44,517
is the way to go?

89
00:03:44,603 --> 00:03:47,556
Oh, it is fun to have so many
surgeons in one family.

90
00:03:47,642 --> 00:03:48,885
Remind me, Avery...
When did you become

91
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:50,673
double board certified in neuro?

92
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:52,243
That's really how you talk
to your patient's family?

93
00:03:52,328 --> 00:03:53,704
It is, actually.

94
00:03:56,197 --> 00:03:57,862
We need to
go in posteriorly

95
00:03:57,947 --> 00:03:59,931
to avoid the carotid
and the jugular,

96
00:04:00,017 --> 00:04:02,462
and to avoid having to weave
through the brachial plexus.

97
00:04:02,548 --> 00:04:04,935
Look, I know how hard
it is to be on the bench,

98
00:04:05,021 --> 00:04:06,771
but we are the A-Team.
And we don't lose.

99
00:04:06,856 --> 00:04:09,774
Just ask Shepherd's tumor.
Oh, wait, you can't.

100
00:04:09,859 --> 00:04:11,809
Because I removed it.
Flawlessly.

101
00:04:12,017 --> 00:04:14,278
Okay,
any last questions?

102
00:04:14,363 --> 00:04:16,881
Um... it looks like
you've got this.

103
00:04:16,966 --> 00:04:18,001
We do.

104
00:04:18,121 --> 00:04:19,665
Mm-hmm.

105
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:22,720
I'm good.

106
00:04:22,805 --> 00:04:25,017
But, you know, I-I um...

107
00:04:25,502 --> 00:04:29,821
I think I'd like to
just take a little walk

108
00:04:30,156 --> 00:04:31,773
before we get started.

109
00:04:32,111 --> 00:04:34,392
- I'd be happy to...
- Oh, no, honey.

110
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,619
I want to go alone.

111
00:04:37,052 --> 00:04:38,642
Okay, then,
but no guarantees

112
00:04:38,728 --> 00:04:40,033
I won't watch you
walk away.

113
00:04:40,119 --> 00:04:41,478
You always do.

114
00:05:17,622 --> 00:05:18,876
Hi. I'm...

115
00:05:18,961 --> 00:05:20,161
Meredith?

116
00:05:20,482 --> 00:05:21,544
Yeah.

117
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:23,458
I'm sorry.
You look...

118
00:05:23,544 --> 00:05:25,114
just like
your picture.

119
00:05:25,599 --> 00:05:27,286
You're the surgeon,
right?

120
00:05:27,372 --> 00:05:28,622
Yeah.

121
00:05:31,528 --> 00:05:33,294
Uh, do you
want to come in?

122
00:05:34,435 --> 00:05:35,793
That's a loaded
question.

123
00:05:44,966 --> 00:05:46,419
I'm not sure
if he's awake.

124
00:05:46,505 --> 00:05:48,204
He sleeps more and more
these days

125
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:49,607
as you can imagine.

126
00:05:49,872 --> 00:05:51,809
Uh, can I get
you something?

127
00:05:51,894 --> 00:05:53,849
Water? Gin, maybe?

128
00:05:56,215 --> 00:05:57,411
All right.

129
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:01,778
Thatcher?
You have a visitor.

130
00:06:10,803 --> 00:06:12,553
Meredith!

131
00:06:14,788 --> 00:06:16,000
Hi...

132
00:06:18,094 --> 00:06:19,420
Hi.

133
00:06:22,014 --> 00:06:24,654
He's not on any pain meds.
Clean and sober.

134
00:06:24,835 --> 00:06:25,999
His wishes.

135
00:06:26,085 --> 00:06:27,710
So, just the oxygen,
if he needs it.

136
00:06:27,795 --> 00:06:29,170
But you know
how that works.

137
00:06:29,256 --> 00:06:30,483
I do.

138
00:06:30,998 --> 00:06:32,348
Well,
I'll leave you to it.

139
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:33,957
My cellphone number
is on the fridge.

140
00:06:34,043 --> 00:06:35,877
If you need anything,
give me a call.

141
00:06:48,436 --> 00:06:51,193
I probably
can't stay very long.

142
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:52,990
I just...

143
00:06:55,627 --> 00:06:58,378
There's so much to say,
I-I...

144
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:00,531
I don't know what to say.

145
00:07:02,037 --> 00:07:04,209
I didn't come here
to say anything

146
00:07:04,497 --> 00:07:06,506
or to hear you
say anything to me, so...

147
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,233
we can just sit,
if that's okay.

148
00:07:08,443 --> 00:07:09,498
Okay.

149
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:45,296
Mom.

150
00:07:45,388 --> 00:07:47,091
I was looking for you.

151
00:07:51,381 --> 00:07:53,521
You know I give Amelia
and Koracick a hard time,

152
00:07:53,607 --> 00:07:55,162
but... they're the best.

153
00:07:55,248 --> 00:07:57,732
I was thinking about
my first surgery.

154
00:07:57,885 --> 00:08:01,060
The very first time
I held a scalpel in my hand.

155
00:08:01,282 --> 00:08:04,653
It was a simple lipoma,
but I was terrified.

156
00:08:04,778 --> 00:08:06,021
Hmm.

157
00:08:06,207 --> 00:08:08,891
I expected to feel
so powerful, invincible.

158
00:08:08,977 --> 00:08:10,411
But the second
that scrub nurse

159
00:08:10,564 --> 00:08:12,732
put that 10 blade
in my hand,

160
00:08:12,965 --> 00:08:14,182
I went ice cold.

161
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:16,574
Okay, so then
what did you do?

162
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:20,130
Diana Ross.
"Ain't No Mountain High Enough."

163
00:08:20,216 --> 00:08:22,258
The first time
I heard that song,

164
00:08:22,343 --> 00:08:25,428
it just filled me with joy
and such calm...

165
00:08:25,513 --> 00:08:26,724
so I just sang it

166
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:29,021
over and over and over
in my head, in that O.R.,

167
00:08:29,107 --> 00:08:33,135
until that same sense of calm
and joy washed over me.

168
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:34,704
And it's been
my secret weapon

169
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:36,706
for everything
that's ever scared me...

170
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:38,007
My first surgery.

171
00:08:38,092 --> 00:08:40,443
Labor with you,
it was on an endless loop.

172
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:45,435
Every PET scan,
every MRI.

173
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:49,615
I remember you singing that song
in the kitchen

174
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,184
when I was doing
my homework.

175
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:53,220
You told me it was old people music.

176
00:08:53,306 --> 00:08:54,823
You wanted Michael Jackson.

177
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,892
I love me some Michael.
Ooh.

178
00:08:56,978 --> 00:08:59,196
I had to pry that
red leather jacket off of you

179
00:08:59,282 --> 00:09:00,380
to get you to go to bed
at night.

180
00:09:00,465 --> 00:09:02,816
Ah, that's true.

181
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:04,302
Oh.

182
00:09:04,504 --> 00:09:06,286
I guess I used to do
the same thing.

183
00:09:06,372 --> 00:09:09,290
My first surgery,
I sang a song in my head.

184
00:09:09,376 --> 00:09:11,860
- I mean, it calmed me, you know?
- I know.

185
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:13,508
I watched you.

186
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:15,910
My first...
How did you watch?

187
00:09:15,996 --> 00:09:18,514
Child, please.
I am Catherine Fox.

188
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:19,715
Do you think
there's a world

189
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,350
where I wouldn't
sneak into the gallery

190
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:22,888
of my baby's
first surgery?

191
00:09:23,097 --> 00:09:25,341
Oh, you were a sight
to see...

192
00:09:25,473 --> 00:09:26,896
Mm.

193
00:09:27,068 --> 00:09:30,086
I bet Harriet does
the same thing someday.

194
00:09:30,226 --> 00:09:33,021
Well, I'll be sneaking up
into the gallery with you, then.

195
00:09:34,348 --> 00:09:35,614
Deal.

196
00:09:36,869 --> 00:09:38,661
That's a deal.

197
00:09:39,767 --> 00:09:42,607
Now, can we please get you
to your room?

198
00:09:42,857 --> 00:09:44,427
Not yet.

199
00:09:45,227 --> 00:09:48,276
- Mom...
- I left the foundation in your name,

200
00:09:48,362 --> 00:09:50,079
just in case
anything happens to me.

201
00:09:50,164 --> 00:09:52,192
Cecilia runs
the day-to-day operations,

202
00:09:52,278 --> 00:09:53,683
Charlie keeps
the books humming,

203
00:09:53,768 --> 00:09:56,247
but they'll need a leader,
a North Star.

204
00:09:56,771 --> 00:09:59,005
And in the event that I'm left
totally paralyzed...

205
00:09:59,091 --> 00:10:00,289
Mom, even if
you can't operate,

206
00:10:00,374 --> 00:10:01,557
you're still gonna run
the foundation, okay?

207
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:03,599
You'll teach.
You're Catherine Fox.

208
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:04,981
What are you gonna do?

209
00:10:05,067 --> 00:10:06,829
You're gonna be all up in my
business and everybody else's.

210
00:10:06,914 --> 00:10:08,459
We both know you're gonna
find a way to do that.

211
00:10:08,544 --> 00:10:10,408
Keep this.
Turn the page.

212
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,817
I've already...
Turn the page.

213
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,205
You planned
your own party?

214
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:17,552
Mom.

215
00:10:17,638 --> 00:10:20,376
If I get out of this alive,
the fun we're gonna have...

216
00:10:20,461 --> 00:10:22,745
And don't you even think about
scrimping on those egg rolls.

217
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,099
You know
they're my favorite.

218
00:10:24,371 --> 00:10:27,856
You really
planned everything.

219
00:10:28,035 --> 00:10:29,825
I always do.

220
00:10:30,696 --> 00:10:32,271
All right, then.

221
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:34,599
Shall we?

222
00:10:41,994 --> 00:10:44,599
Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe.

223
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:47,803
Phillip put these everywhere
for me.

224
00:10:48,235 --> 00:10:50,946
He said it's supposed to
be soothing.

225
00:10:51,032 --> 00:10:52,172
Truth be told,

226
00:10:52,258 --> 00:10:53,672
it just makes me
miss it more.

227
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:56,907
A few years back,
a student told me about

228
00:10:57,079 --> 00:11:00,415
a semester he took abroad
building schools.

229
00:11:01,149 --> 00:11:05,235
Lexie was gone,
and I thought I could either

230
00:11:05,726 --> 00:11:07,508
drown my grief
in a bottle of Scotch

231
00:11:07,594 --> 00:11:09,625
or do something.
So I did something.

232
00:11:13,582 --> 00:11:14,688
In Zimbabwe.

233
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:18,711
The sunsets, Meredith...
and the quiet.

234
00:11:19,262 --> 00:11:21,969
The people that I met,
they have this passion

235
00:11:22,055 --> 00:11:26,743
for... life, loving,
learning...

236
00:11:30,493 --> 00:11:32,180
And then you got sick.

237
00:11:32,348 --> 00:11:34,431
I thought
I'd just come home,

238
00:11:34,517 --> 00:11:36,317
do whatever treatment
I needed to do,

239
00:11:36,403 --> 00:11:39,602
and then go back, but...
It was good. Coming home.

240
00:11:39,719 --> 00:11:44,399
It gave me a chance to...
It was the right thing to do.

241
00:11:48,115 --> 00:11:49,915
You went and got
a whole new life.

242
00:11:50,117 --> 00:11:51,850
I did.

243
00:11:53,969 --> 00:11:55,094
I'm glad for you.

244
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:57,806
I'm glad you saw sunsets
and built schools

245
00:11:57,892 --> 00:12:00,352
for people who needed them
and you stayed sober.

246
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:02,149
You went and got
a whole new life.

247
00:12:02,258 --> 00:12:04,719
Halfway across the world
this time.

248
00:12:06,586 --> 00:12:07,875
But you didn't
give a damn

249
00:12:07,961 --> 00:12:09,660
about the people
you left behind.

250
00:12:13,977 --> 00:12:15,056
Say it again.

251
00:12:15,219 --> 00:12:18,125
We make an incision posteriorly
from C3 to T4,

252
00:12:18,211 --> 00:12:19,261
and then use
the stealth probe

253
00:12:19,346 --> 00:12:20,863
to mark the coordinates
of the tumor.

254
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:22,698
And then do
partial laminectomies

255
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:25,501
to access the tumor
and remove it en bloc.

256
00:12:25,586 --> 00:12:26,669
Perfect. Brilliant.

257
00:12:26,754 --> 00:12:28,070
We are incredible.

258
00:12:28,155 --> 00:12:29,505
Someone should really do
a study on us.

259
00:12:31,926 --> 00:12:33,442
Okay, say it.

260
00:12:33,527 --> 00:12:35,845
What? Wh...
Oh. No.

261
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:38,214
Ha ha! I'm good.

262
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:40,954
Good, good, good, good.
Big Gun.

263
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:43,907
Ready to Big Gun the crap
out of this tumor.

264
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:46,501
Damn it.

265
00:12:46,631 --> 00:12:48,594
- Even my arrogance is off.
- Right?

266
00:12:48,776 --> 00:12:50,290
Right.

267
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:52,694
W-What if we try, uh,
your thing?

268
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:55,097
You know, the... the word-vomit
and the feelings?

269
00:12:55,182 --> 00:12:57,466
That seems to work.
For you.

270
00:12:57,551 --> 00:12:58,727
Okay.

271
00:12:59,053 --> 00:13:00,853
You... you first.

272
00:13:02,218 --> 00:13:04,302
This is the largest tumor
I've ever seen

273
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:05,774
on the biggest legend
I've ever known,

274
00:13:05,859 --> 00:13:07,776
and if I screw this up,
I'm gonna have to live out

275
00:13:07,861 --> 00:13:08,744
the rest of my
ill-fated surgical career

276
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:09,712
fixing idiot teenagers

277
00:13:09,797 --> 00:13:11,146
who get hurt cow-tipping
in Lawrence, Kansas,

278
00:13:11,231 --> 00:13:12,381
'cause I can't look
Richard in the eye

279
00:13:12,466 --> 00:13:14,219
knowing I gorked
his legend wife.

280
00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:15,885
That is specific.

281
00:13:16,133 --> 00:13:17,352
Well...
I'm saying,

282
00:13:17,438 --> 00:13:19,594
how do you get hurt cow-tipping?
It's a thing.

283
00:13:19,946 --> 00:13:22,415
Just... You. Go.

284
00:13:22,501 --> 00:13:25,180
Uh, Catherine Fox is an icon,
and a magician,

285
00:13:25,266 --> 00:13:26,561
and a giant among men...

286
00:13:26,647 --> 00:13:28,564
And not just
for the reasons you think.

287
00:13:28,649 --> 00:13:30,132
She's saved more penises
in her O.R.

288
00:13:30,217 --> 00:13:31,567
than any surgeon
on the planet.

289
00:13:31,652 --> 00:13:32,701
And all I keep imagining

290
00:13:32,786 --> 00:13:34,567
are the dozens of men
with zero-functioning penises,

291
00:13:34,652 --> 00:13:35,974
doomed to live out
their sexless lives

292
00:13:36,059 --> 00:13:37,606
if I botch this surgery.

293
00:13:38,415 --> 00:13:39,941
That's what
you're worried about?

294
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:41,546
Men and their junk?

295
00:13:42,224 --> 00:13:44,245
That,
and if I lose her...

296
00:13:45,878 --> 00:13:47,558
I've lost enough.

297
00:13:49,102 --> 00:13:50,652
So let's keep her alive.

298
00:13:53,107 --> 00:13:54,792
Let's keep her alive.

299
00:14:08,508 --> 00:14:10,796
I told them I didn't need
a personal escort

300
00:14:10,882 --> 00:14:12,532
to my own surgery.

301
00:14:12,626 --> 00:14:13,943
Well,
that's just making sure

302
00:14:14,028 --> 00:14:15,558
you don't make a break
for it.

303
00:14:15,675 --> 00:14:17,592
Thomas,
make sure that I wake up

304
00:14:17,678 --> 00:14:20,519
with good motor
and nerve function.

305
00:14:20,672 --> 00:14:23,206
And don't forget
to get clean margins.

306
00:14:23,623 --> 00:14:24,972
I wouldn't dream of it.

307
00:14:25,058 --> 00:14:26,156
And would
you tell my husband

308
00:14:26,241 --> 00:14:28,362
he does not have to sit up
in that gallery all day?

309
00:14:28,448 --> 00:14:29,464
"For better, for worse"

310
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:31,727
does not include
seeing your wife's insides.

311
00:14:31,812 --> 00:14:33,573
You know,
you wouldn't be you

312
00:14:33,659 --> 00:14:35,316
if you weren't
bossing us all around

313
00:14:35,402 --> 00:14:37,120
up until
the last second.

314
00:14:37,456 --> 00:14:38,902
You nervous?

315
00:14:39,607 --> 00:14:41,202
Were you?

316
00:14:41,409 --> 00:14:44,640
A little bit.
But I turned out just fine.

317
00:14:44,725 --> 00:14:46,003
That's because
I was perfect,

318
00:14:46,089 --> 00:14:48,077
which I'm willing
to be again.

319
00:14:48,162 --> 00:14:49,211
Well, you better be.

320
00:14:49,296 --> 00:14:50,776
Oh, Richard,
I always liked you.

321
00:14:50,862 --> 00:14:51,914
No, you didn't.

322
00:14:51,999 --> 00:14:53,573
And I'm fine
as long as she's fine.

323
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:56,430
Okay, okay, can I have a minute
with my husband, please?

324
00:15:14,602 --> 00:15:18,737
I will see you...
when I wake up.

325
00:15:19,612 --> 00:15:20,941
Jackson?

326
00:15:21,183 --> 00:15:22,417
Where's Jackson?

327
00:15:24,373 --> 00:15:25,580
♪ <i>Oh, oh, oh, oh</i> ♪

328
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:26,782

381
00:17:58,324 --> 00:18:00,074

you said we would try,
right?

388

You said we could

You didn't fight.

No, you don't know,

392
00:18:21,858 --> 00:18:23,096
because you weren't here.

393
00:18:23,385 --> 00:18:26,537
I lost my sister.
I lost my husband.

394
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:28,169

nowhere to be found.

395

397
00:18:32,467 --> 00:18:34,108
No, why would you say
something like that?

398
00:18:34,194 --> 00:18:36,044
Because it's the truth,
Meredith.

399
00:18:36,129 --> 00:18:38,365
Richard told me Derek died.
I bought a ticket.

400
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:39,389
I flew all day,
all night.

401
00:18:39,475 --> 00:18:41,749
I got to the funeral just...
Just in time.

402
00:18:41,834 --> 00:18:43,785
I stood a few rows back.

403
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:46,694
Next to some of your doctor
friends from the hospital.

404
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:49,748
I would remember
if you were at his funeral.

405
00:18:49,834 --> 00:18:50,951
I was there, Meredith.

406
00:18:51,037 --> 00:18:53,326
But you were barely there.
You were a ghost.

407
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,670
You looked like me
when I lost Susan and Lexie.

408
00:18:56,756 --> 00:18:58,299
Are you saying
you came to the funeral

409
00:18:58,384 --> 00:18:59,490
and didn't speak to me?

410
00:18:59,576 --> 00:19:02,136
I felt like it would...
Would have been for me,

We close up the incision.

473
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,339
We flip her onto her side.
I go in from the front.

474

We meet in the middle to
decompress and unearth this thing.

475
00:22:11,344 --> 00:22:12,675

you are insane.

492
00:23:18,786 --> 00:23:21,482

She'd always do that.

494
00:23:25,293 --> 00:23:26,426

496
00:23:28,786 --> 00:23:30,184

497
00:23:30,286 --> 00:23:33,317

about it or not.

498
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,513

00:24:04,895 --> 00:24:07,395

I think
I'm gonna have trouble

543
00:26:29,072 --> 00:26:31,156
getting around
the C7 facet

544
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:34,057
while keeping the tumor
retracted from this angle.

545
00:26:34,143 --> 00:26:35,604

Is that when you and Richard
started talking?

555
00:27:13,226 --> 00:27:14,577
After the funeral?

556
00:27:19,604 --> 00:27:21,351
I tried calling you.

557
00:27:21,827 --> 00:27:23,421
You never called back.

558
00:27:23,718 --> 00:27:24,834
And I worried.

559
00:27:25,013 --> 00:27:28,491
At first,
I was just checking in on you.

560
00:27:30,554 --> 00:27:33,602
Mm, Richard and I started...

561
00:27:33,688 --> 00:27:35,296
Talking about
a lot of things.

562
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:38,718
We both
had amends to make.

563
00:27:39,127 --> 00:27:41,171
There are so many things

564
00:27:41,312 --> 00:27:43,984
I could say I'm sorry for,
Meredith.

565
00:27:44,695 --> 00:27:48,905
But all I really want to say
is thank you.

566
00:27:49,445 --> 00:27:50,921
Thank you for what?

567
00:27:52,663 --> 00:27:57,655
For so long,
I measured my life

568
00:27:57,745 --> 00:28:02,663
in the things done to me,
taken from me.

569
00:28:03,202 --> 00:28:09,163
Now I can see my life
for exactly what it is.

570
00:28:09,249 --> 00:28:11,475
Some people have
more pain than others.

571
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:15,046
But no one, nothing,
was conspiring against me.

572
00:28:15,226 --> 00:28:18,366
When you gave me
a piece of your liver,

573
00:28:18,452 --> 00:28:23,507
you gave me time,
precious time.

574
00:28:24,530 --> 00:28:26,984
Time to get your head
out of your own ass?

575
00:28:36,384 --> 00:28:39,302
Y... Y...
You could say that.

576
00:28:40,757 --> 00:28:45,968
I had a life, Meredith,
'cause of you.

577
00:28:46,342 --> 00:28:52,481
My own real, honest,
painful, incredible life.

578
00:28:52,567 --> 00:28:57,210
I just wish you
and I could have shared it.

579
00:28:58,577 --> 00:29:02,359
Well, I guess you did
try this time.

580
00:29:02,445 --> 00:29:03,728
I just didn't know.

581
00:29:06,385 --> 00:29:07,868
I miss Lexie.

582
00:29:09,312 --> 00:29:11,196
I miss her so much.

583
00:29:11,804 --> 00:29:13,624
Me too.

584
00:29:14,724 --> 00:29:17,843
I'm sorry you lost her.

585
00:29:17,949 --> 00:29:22,585
I know how much it... it meant
to you, having a sister.

586
00:29:24,528 --> 00:29:26,374
I have another sister.

587
00:29:27,116 --> 00:29:31,155
But you and Molly,
you were never close.

588
00:29:34,498 --> 00:29:36,515
Her name is Maggie.

589
00:29:37,195 --> 00:29:38,601
Oh...

590
00:29:38,853 --> 00:29:41,562
She's brilliant.
And kind.

591
00:29:41,937 --> 00:29:45,401
She's the best of Ellis
and Richard.

592
00:29:45,765 --> 00:29:50,540
Your... Your mother
and Richard had a baby.

593
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:59,265
At least something good
came from all that.

594
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:09,033
I'm gonna get
a humpback operating with you.

595
00:30:09,233 --> 00:30:10,479
I'm already standing
on a step stool.

596
00:30:10,564 --> 00:30:11,698
What more do you want
from me?

597
00:30:11,783 --> 00:30:12,901
Heels?

598
00:30:13,548 --> 00:30:15,533
Okay,
it looks like the tumor

599
00:30:15,619 --> 00:30:16,993
is free of
the brachial plexus.

600
00:30:17,085 --> 00:30:18,112
Should we try
to pull it out?

601
00:30:18,197 --> 00:30:19,384
Let's do it.

602
00:30:20,293 --> 00:30:22,283
We've lost
all the signal from one arm.

603
00:30:22,368 --> 00:30:23,970
The tumor
is moving pretty easily.

604
00:30:24,056 --> 00:30:25,448
Check your machine.
Could be artifact.

605
00:30:25,533 --> 00:30:28,533
No, there's still a little
tension from my side.

606
00:30:28,937 --> 00:30:30,697
I... I think it's coming
from the root.

607
00:30:30,806 --> 00:30:32,744
Which means there's no way
to remove this without...

608
00:30:32,946 --> 00:30:34,535
Risking paralysis.

609
00:30:37,224 --> 00:30:38,651
If they can't remove
the whole tumor,

610
00:30:38,736 --> 00:30:40,390
they're gonna have to do it
piecemeal.

611
00:30:40,634 --> 00:30:41,751
But then they risk

612
00:30:41,837 --> 00:30:43,787
leaving some of the tumor
behind.

613
00:30:48,577 --> 00:30:50,294
What?

614
00:30:55,223 --> 00:30:56,573
My path pen.

615
00:30:56,658 --> 00:30:58,204
Remove the tumor piecemeal,

616
00:30:58,290 --> 00:31:00,207
and then use the pen
to see if you got it all.

617
00:31:00,293 --> 00:31:02,715
Okay, it hasn't cleared
FDA process yet,

618
00:31:02,915 --> 00:31:05,931
and it isn't on the market,
but I'm telling you, it works.

619
00:31:09,767 --> 00:31:11,988
<i>I really have
always liked you, Richard.</i>

620
00:31:12,073 --> 00:31:13,876
No, you haven't.

621
00:31:14,613 --> 00:31:16,596
Yes. Get it.

622
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:25,665
And that twitch
over her right eye

623
00:31:25,728 --> 00:31:27,579
when you switched
the ice maker

624
00:31:27,665 --> 00:31:28,798
from cubed to crushed.

625
00:31:28,884 --> 00:31:30,548
"What kind of a monster
crushes ice?

626
00:31:30,634 --> 00:31:31,767
It's uncivilized."

627
00:31:31,853 --> 00:31:33,978
Crushed ice
was uncivilized.

628
00:31:34,064 --> 00:31:35,783
Taking my last cup
of coffee...

629
00:31:35,869 --> 00:31:37,900
- uncivilized.
- Uncivilized.

630
00:31:37,986 --> 00:31:40,470
Getting an A-
in Chem Lab.

631
00:31:40,556 --> 00:31:42,368
- Uncivilized.
- Uncivilized.

632
00:31:42,454 --> 00:31:44,371
She was...

633
00:31:44,758 --> 00:31:45,908
Kind of a tyrant.

634
00:31:45,994 --> 00:31:47,010
But brilliant.

635
00:31:47,096 --> 00:31:48,486
Oh, I can't argue
with that.

636
00:31:48,572 --> 00:31:50,486
Terrible driver.

637
00:31:50,595 --> 00:31:52,353
Can't argue with that.

638
00:31:53,212 --> 00:31:55,819
But she was
extraordinary.

639
00:31:56,084 --> 00:31:58,158
Yeah.
Oh.

640
00:31:59,462 --> 00:32:01,512
Do you regret
marrying her?

641
00:32:03,655 --> 00:32:06,517
The entire time
she was pregnant with you,

642
00:32:06,603 --> 00:32:08,329
she pretended
she wasn't.

643
00:32:08,555 --> 00:32:12,478
I don't know if it was
stubbornness or denial.

644
00:32:12,564 --> 00:32:13,900
Maybe both.

645
00:32:14,044 --> 00:32:17,763
Nine months, she had to do
everything herself.

646
00:32:17,871 --> 00:32:19,611
And I had to let her.

647
00:32:19,893 --> 00:32:22,986
The night she went into labor,
she came home after surgery,

648
00:32:23,079 --> 00:32:27,650
and she just stood
in the doorway, wide-eyed.

649
00:32:28,467 --> 00:32:31,079
"We're having a baby,
Thatch.

650
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:35,095
We're having a baby."

651
00:32:39,376 --> 00:32:42,548
As if the idea just hit her,
right there.

652
00:32:42,689 --> 00:32:45,607
She... She started to laugh.
She couldn't stop laughing.

653
00:32:45,693 --> 00:32:49,392
Laughed all the way
to the hospital.

654
00:32:49,571 --> 00:32:52,555
I never heard her laugh
like that,

655
00:32:52,751 --> 00:32:56,659
so big, so free.

656
00:32:58,204 --> 00:33:01,064
And I just thought,
"Wow.

657
00:33:01,915 --> 00:33:05,968
What a way for you
to come into the world."

658
00:33:07,548 --> 00:33:09,532
We weren't perfect.

659
00:33:09,848 --> 00:33:12,900
We weren't even happy
a lot of the time.

660
00:33:13,902 --> 00:33:16,587
But I'd marry her
all over again

661
00:33:17,207 --> 00:33:20,962
for that night,
that laugh.

662
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,767
And you.

663
00:33:24,345 --> 00:33:26,032
And this.

664
00:33:27,774 --> 00:33:31,087
I'd do it all again
for this.

665
00:33:39,415 --> 00:33:40,752
How can there
still be cancer there?

666
00:33:40,837 --> 00:33:41,987
We've been at this
for hours.

667
00:33:42,073 --> 00:33:43,657
It's still lighting up
like Christmas.

668
00:33:43,743 --> 00:33:45,860
Let's just keep going.

669
00:33:45,946 --> 00:33:48,264
We'll hit clear tissue
eventually.

670
00:33:50,798 --> 00:33:51,915
Signal's fading again.

671
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,221
She's losing function
in her arms.

672
00:33:53,306 --> 00:33:55,390
- We've barely touched anything.
- Breathe.

673
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:57,650
We are going
in the right direction.

674
00:33:57,978 --> 00:33:59,322
Losing the signal
in her other arm...

675
00:33:59,407 --> 00:34:01,321
Okay, stop it! We know!
If we keep going,

676
00:34:01,407 --> 00:34:02,942
we cost Catherine
her motor function,

677
00:34:03,028 --> 00:34:05,045
her career, her life
as she knows it... we know!

678
00:34:16,390 --> 00:34:17,587
Meredith...

679
00:34:17,746 --> 00:34:19,630
Okay,
don't try to speak.

680
00:34:20,106 --> 00:34:22,314
But... the closet.

681
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,227
I left something...

682
00:34:24,931 --> 00:34:27,150
I don't need anything.

683
00:34:27,439 --> 00:34:29,150
For your kids.

684
00:34:31,336 --> 00:34:32,618
I wish...

685
00:34:33,657 --> 00:34:36,595
I wish I knew them.

686
00:34:37,025 --> 00:34:40,430
I thought of...
I thought of them.

687
00:34:43,627 --> 00:34:45,210
Ahh.

688
00:34:45,915 --> 00:34:49,009
Your hands are so cold.

689
00:34:49,095 --> 00:34:50,244
Sorry, I can...

690
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:53,181
No, no, no.

691
00:34:53,636 --> 00:34:56,223
Oh, it feels good.

692
00:35:01,691 --> 00:35:07,079
Zola is so smart
and so strong.

693
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:10,400
Yeah?
And she keeps me on my toes

694
00:35:10,548 --> 00:35:12,462
every minute
of every day.

695
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:16,595
And Bailey says "funny"
before every sentence.

696
00:35:16,797 --> 00:35:19,081
"Funny,
I'd like an apple.

697
00:35:19,361 --> 00:35:21,400
Funny, I need pajamas."

698
00:35:21,657 --> 00:35:24,368
It's so cute.

699
00:35:24,798 --> 00:35:28,851
And Ellis...
she is brave.

700
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:32,095
And she's obsessed
with hip-hop.

701
00:35:32,834 --> 00:35:38,361
They are exhausting...
and amazing.

702
00:35:40,984 --> 00:35:43,329
I wish you knew them,
too.

703
00:35:44,555 --> 00:35:47,874
Because they are so,
so beautiful.

704
00:36:31,583 --> 00:36:32,815
How...

705
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:36,242
Easy. Easy, Mom.

706
00:36:36,327 --> 00:36:39,078
How... How...
Easy, easy, easy, easy.

707
00:36:39,163 --> 00:36:40,646
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh,
shh, shh, shh.

708
00:36:40,731 --> 00:36:41,810
Hey.

709
00:36:41,896 --> 00:36:44,475
- Mm-hmm.
- Uh-huh. -I feel that.

710
00:36:44,654 --> 00:36:47,279
Okay.
Hold on, hold on.

711
00:36:47,365 --> 00:36:50,982
All right. Well,
your reflexes are normal.

712
00:36:51,124 --> 00:36:55,966
My hands and feet move.
Whoo.

713
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,240
I'm not dead?
With that tumor?

714
00:36:58,326 --> 00:37:00,357
No, you're most definitely
not dead.

715
00:37:00,443 --> 00:37:03,318
Oh, I thought for sure
they were gonna kill me.

716
00:37:08,107 --> 00:37:09,521
What?

717
00:37:11,806 --> 00:37:13,130
Tell me.

718
00:37:13,235 --> 00:37:15,740
Catherine, when we went in
to get the tumor,

719
00:37:16,618 --> 00:37:19,203
it was adherent
to your brachial plexus.

720
00:37:19,343 --> 00:37:22,434
We were able
to remove about 95% of it,

721
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:25,418
but we had to leave
one nodule behind.

722
00:37:26,497 --> 00:37:30,974
So... radiation? Chemo?

723
00:37:33,126 --> 00:37:35,709
They've had some success
with proton beam therapy.

724
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:37,240
Some?

725
00:37:38,723 --> 00:37:41,763
It's likely,
even with treatment...

726
00:37:42,161 --> 00:37:44,498
I'll have to live
with this cancer

727
00:37:44,584 --> 00:37:46,115
the rest of my life.

728
00:37:46,663 --> 00:37:50,966
I was sure you'd get it all
or kill me trying.

729
00:37:51,052 --> 00:37:52,969
So did we.

730
00:37:53,669 --> 00:37:55,560
Catherine,
I'm so sorry.

731
00:37:56,209 --> 00:37:59,685
Sorry? I'm alive.

732
00:38:00,544 --> 00:38:03,130
I can live with this
for many years.

733
00:38:03,311 --> 00:38:07,102
People live with cancer.
We've all seen it happen.

734
00:38:07,188 --> 00:38:09,012
You're gonna have to get, uh,
scans every three months

735
00:38:09,097 --> 00:38:10,988
to make sure the tumor
doesn't, uh, grow.

736
00:38:11,074 --> 00:38:12,871
And in between,
I'll operate.

737
00:38:13,111 --> 00:38:15,339
- Mm.
- And I'll hug my son.

738
00:38:15,425 --> 00:38:16,996
Mm.

739
00:38:17,725 --> 00:38:19,871
Make love to my husband.

740
00:38:19,957 --> 00:38:20,978
Okay...

741
00:38:21,064 --> 00:38:24,535
Chase my Harriet,
make mistakes,

742
00:38:24,667 --> 00:38:27,824
and fight about who gets
to pick the movie on date night.

743
00:38:31,868 --> 00:38:34,352
You two have given me
my life back.

744
00:38:36,001 --> 00:38:37,284
Now what?

745
00:38:37,712 --> 00:38:39,161
'Cause we didn't
plan on this.

746
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:43,488
These two pulled off
a miracle.

747
00:38:44,308 --> 00:38:46,816
Miracles aren't always
punctuation marks.

748
00:38:46,902 --> 00:38:48,819
But they are worth celebrating.

749
00:38:48,905 --> 00:38:51,222
So we are gonna have
that party.

750
00:38:51,350 --> 00:38:54,230
We just might have to wait
a couple of months

751
00:38:54,316 --> 00:38:56,166
so I can get
on the dance floor.

752
00:38:58,941 --> 00:39:01,253
I love you.

753
00:39:18,465 --> 00:39:20,949
Hey.
I heard about the surgery.

754
00:39:21,034 --> 00:39:22,332
Congratulations.

755
00:39:22,418 --> 00:39:23,371
Oh. I know, I know.

756
00:39:23,457 --> 00:39:24,552
You knew I had it in me
all along.

757
00:39:24,637 --> 00:39:26,551
Honestly?
I was on the fence.

758
00:39:31,301 --> 00:39:32,950
You should be
really proud.

759
00:39:33,129 --> 00:39:35,687
There are not a lot of surgeons
who could do that.

760
00:39:35,809 --> 00:39:36,899
Which part?

761
00:39:36,985 --> 00:39:38,224
Where I flipped my friend
like a pancake

762
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:40,160
or failed to leave her
cancer free?

763
00:39:40,722 --> 00:39:42,293
The part where
you saved her life

764
00:39:42,379 --> 00:39:44,247
and her surgical career.

765
00:39:46,591 --> 00:39:48,872
Yeah, that part
wasn't half bad.

766
00:39:51,255 --> 00:39:52,622
You should celebrate.

767
00:39:53,465 --> 00:39:54,545
Why don't you get
cleaned up?

768
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:56,420
I'll meet you at Joe's,
and I'll buy you a drink.

769
00:39:56,505 --> 00:39:58,823
Uh... w...
Can we take a rain check?

770
00:39:58,909 --> 00:40:01,126
I... I'm wiped.
And I-I smell bad.

771
00:40:01,212 --> 00:40:05,512
And when you spend money on me,
I want to smell good.

772
00:40:05,668 --> 00:40:07,739
Yeah. Okay.

773
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:08,956
Night.

774
00:40:09,042 --> 00:40:10,590
