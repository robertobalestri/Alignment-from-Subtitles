you had the whole picture.

168
00:06:24,721 --> 00:06:26,238

Uma Paxton, 25, here for
total pelvic exenteration

235
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:55,398
with flap reconstruction
for a recurrent vaginal tumor.

236
00:08:55,483 --> 00:08:56,733
Not total, Dr. Helm.

237
00:08:56,818 --> 00:08:59,002
We are preserving
the uterus.

238
00:08:59,087 --> 00:09:00,137
Oh.

239
00:09:00,222 --> 00:09:01,404
Wow, that's possible?

240
00:09:01,489 --> 00:09:02,572
It is now.

241
00:09:02,657 --> 00:09:04,441
Because I developed
the technique.

242
00:09:04,526 --> 00:09:07,310
My first doctors blasted me
with chemo and radiation,

243
00:09:07,395 --> 00:09:09,079
but it came back,

244
00:09:09,164 --> 00:09:12,015
so they said I had to remove
most of my insides,

245
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:15,318
but Dr. Fox
found a silver lining.

246
00:09:15,403 --> 00:09:16,987
- Dr. Webber?
- I'll make an incision

247
00:09:17,072 --> 00:09:19,422
into your abdomen
and remove your rectum

248
00:09:19,507 --> 00:09:21,424
to create a colostomy

249
00:09:21,509 --> 00:09:23,326
while Dr. Fox
removes your bladder

250
00:09:23,411 --> 00:09:24,694
and creates a urostomy.

251
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:26,263
And then
I will remove the tumor

252
00:09:26,348 --> 00:09:28,298
and everything
but your uterus.

253
00:09:28,383 --> 00:09:30,033
I'll lead on
your vaginal reconstruction.

254
00:09:30,118 --> 00:09:32,869
We'll cover any defects with
skin and fat from your belly.

255
00:09:32,954 --> 00:09:34,971
So...
not complicated.

256
00:09:37,025 --> 00:09:39,042
Man, I didn't think
that I ever wanted kids

257
00:09:39,127 --> 00:09:41,711
until I found out that I might
not be able to have any,

258
00:09:41,796 --> 00:09:45,682
so thank you, Dr. Fox.

259
00:09:45,767 --> 00:09:48,084
Uma, we've talked
about this before,

260
00:09:48,169 --> 00:09:50,020
but now that
the day has come,

261
00:09:50,105 --> 00:09:52,088
I really have to ask again.

262
00:09:52,173 --> 00:09:54,457
This surgery's long,
it's complex,

263
00:09:54,542 --> 00:09:56,126
and it's very personal.

264
00:09:56,211 --> 00:09:58,261
Are you sure you're all right
with other doctors

265
00:09:58,346 --> 00:10:00,597
watching from the gallery?

266
00:10:00,682 --> 00:10:02,432
You're a pioneer,

267
00:10:02,517 --> 00:10:06,002
and this could help save
more women like me.

268
00:10:06,087 --> 00:10:08,638
So teach away.

269
00:10:08,723 --> 00:10:10,907
All right, guys.
Let's do this.

270
00:10:14,362 --> 00:10:17,347
I'm gonna
be right back, all right?

271
00:10:17,432 --> 00:10:18,548
It's like
a plague in here.

272
00:10:18,633 --> 00:10:20,617
Bronchitis, pneumonia,
some gastroenteritis.

273
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:22,919
Whoa, you okay?

274
00:10:23,004 --> 00:10:24,621
Ohh. What do we got?

275
00:10:24,706 --> 00:10:26,156

who fell from a balcony,

277
00:10:27,442 --> 00:10:29,359
and almost everyone else
is flu-like symptoms.

278
00:10:29,444 --> 00:10:31,928
Including you, I guess.

279
00:10:32,013 --> 00:10:33,096
Look, if you want
to grab some rest,

280
00:10:33,181 --> 00:10:34,464
I can page you
if anything's urgent.

281
00:10:34,549 --> 00:10:35,732
- Incoming!
- Uh... Ohh.

282
00:10:35,817 --> 00:10:37,300
- Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!
- I'm gonna muscle through.

283
00:10:37,385 --> 00:10:39,169
Could you, uh,
prep an IV, uh,

284
00:10:39,254 --> 00:10:41,171
bag of LR
and 4 milligrams of Zofran?

285
00:10:41,256 --> 00:10:43,273
Yeah. You got it.
Thanks.

286
00:10:43,358 --> 00:10:44,841
So, we have our
interdepartmental meetings,

287
00:10:44,926 --> 00:10:47,010
M&Ms, lung tumor boards,
and such

288
00:10:47,095 --> 00:10:48,078
in the conference room.

289
00:10:48,163 --> 00:10:49,613
Oh, good,
you still do it there.

290
00:10:49,698 --> 00:10:50,981
I-I moved it
from the lecture hall

291
00:10:51,066 --> 00:10:53,283
to get a more open
and honest exchange.

292
00:10:53,368 --> 00:10:55,552
"A more open
and honest exchange."

293
00:10:55,637 --> 00:10:57,320
You don't say.

294
00:10:57,405 --> 00:10:59,656
Well, it's just that my sister's
kinda wrecked right now

295
00:10:59,741 --> 00:11:01,992
because you failed to have
an open and honest exchange.

296
00:11:02,077 --> 00:11:03,126
I told them.

297

00:11:37,445 --> 00:11:38,662
Hey, guys,
what did you see?

311
00:11:38,747 --> 00:11:41,060
She was like,
"Ow, my stomach."

312
00:11:41,146 --> 00:11:42,999
Then she was like,
"Ow, my face."

313
00:11:43,084 --> 00:11:44,567
Nice, guys. Real nice.

314
00:11:44,652 --> 00:11:46,002
Ma'am, do you have
any other symptoms

315
00:11:46,087 --> 00:11:47,404
uh, dizziness or headache?

316
00:11:47,489 --> 00:11:50,373
Uh, yeah, headache because
Gabe just told me today

317
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:52,208
that his project
is due tomorrow...

318
00:11:52,293 --> 00:11:53,777
- Quit touching me!
- You touched me first!

319
00:11:53,862 --> 00:11:55,512
And I have the flu,
and I hate children,

320
00:11:55,597 --> 00:11:57,080
- so life is punishing me.
- No! Let me go!

321
00:11:57,165 --> 00:11:59,282
So if I could just get
something for my stomach

322
00:11:59,367 --> 00:12:00,884
and some sedatives for the children...
Let me go!

323
00:12:00,969 --> 00:12:01,785
- We'll be good to go.
- Hey, watch out.

324
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:03,653
Hey, guys, guys,
knock it off.

325
00:12:03,738 --> 00:12:04,854
Should we call
their parents?

326
00:12:04,939 --> 00:12:06,623
- I am their parents...
- It's your fault!

327
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:08,325
Ever since
my sister died,

328
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:10,393
and clearly,
I'm crushing it... Ow!

329
00:12:10,478 --> 00:12:11,695
Abdomen's a little tender.

330
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,096
Uh, Schmitt, do you want
to see if CT's open?

331
00:12:13,181 --> 00:12:14,798
Whoa, CT?
No, no, I'm fine.

332
00:12:14,883 --> 00:12:17,300
I just have the flu,
and I already took antibiotics

333
00:12:17,385 --> 00:12:19,135
I had left over
from last year, so...

334
00:12:21,189 --> 00:12:22,138
Bad idea?

335
00:12:22,223 --> 00:12:23,840
Unprescribed?
Yes.

336
00:12:23,925 --> 00:12:25,275
Listen, I know
that you're stressed,

337
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,410
and maybe it is
just the flu, but...

338
00:12:27,495 --> 00:12:28,545
Claire, if it isn't,

339
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:32,215
you're really gonna wish
that you'd stayed, okay?

340
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,550
Are you okay?

341
00:12:33,635 --> 00:12:35,752
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I'm fine.

342
00:12:35,837 --> 00:12:37,387
He sounds like me.

343
00:12:39,841 --> 00:12:42,759
Free fluid in the pelvis
and abdomen.

344
00:12:42,844 --> 00:12:43,827
X-rays are up.

345
00:12:43,912 --> 00:12:45,895

00:12:47,449 --> 00:12:49,299
She's got
a windswept pelvis.

348
00:12:49,384 --> 00:12:51,334
"Windswept"?
It's a combo platter.

349
00:12:51,419 --> 00:12:52,469
We got AP compression
on one side,

350
00:12:52,554 --> 00:12:54,137
lateral compression
on the other.

351
00:12:54,222 --> 00:12:55,805
You see the widened
SI joint here

352
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:57,073
and the sacral fracture
there?

353
00:12:57,158 --> 00:12:58,341
Okay, well, I'd love
to get her up to the O.R.

354
00:12:58,426 --> 00:12:59,609
for a neuro check.

355
00:12:59,694 --> 00:13:01,511
And we can do an intra-op CT
when we get there.

356
00:13:01,596 --> 00:13:02,912
100%. Let's do it.

357
00:13:02,997 --> 00:13:04,647
Well, wait, aren't we gonna
stabilize her pelvis first?

358
00:13:04,732 --> 00:13:06,182
Of course.
Nah.

359
00:13:06,267 --> 00:13:07,417
"Nah"? She's got
a pelvic fracture.

360
00:13:07,502 --> 00:13:08,785
You're not gonna at least
put a binder on her?

361
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:10,453
Nope.
We'll see you up there.

362
00:13:10,538 --> 00:13:12,822
♪♪

363
00:13:13,908 --> 00:13:15,225
All right.
She's hypotensive.

364
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:17,109
We got to move, people.

365
00:13:24,652 --> 00:13:26,336
She's all prepped
for her ex-lap.

366
00:13:26,421 --> 00:13:27,804
Okay, so what
made you think

367
00:13:27,889 --> 00:13:30,507
that Link and I
would be a good match?

368
00:13:30,592 --> 00:13:32,375
Okay, listen,
before I met Alex,

369
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:34,411
Link was the very best person
that I knew,

370
00:13:34,496 --> 00:13:37,614
and Alex would say the
same thing about you, so...

371
00:13:37,699 --> 00:13:40,183
Oh, come on.
Link's a great guy.

372
00:13:40,268 --> 00:13:41,785
And Labradors
are great dogs.

373
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:43,119
They're always
happy to see you,

374
00:13:43,204 --> 00:13:44,721
they're super cute,
and they're full of energy.

375
00:13:44,806 --> 00:13:46,489
Okay, listen.
He is not a Labrador.

376
00:13:46,574 --> 00:13:48,792
You just have to
get to know him.

377
00:13:50,812 --> 00:13:53,163
Who's ready to put
a pelvis back together, huh?

378
00:13:53,248 --> 00:13:54,464
I am.

379
00:13:54,549 --> 00:13:56,032
I am<i> ready.</i>

380
00:13:57,385 --> 00:13:58,735
Did you jog up here?

381
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:01,204
Ran up the stairs. Gets the
blood flowing, you know?

382
00:14:01,289 --> 00:14:03,006
We got to save this lady.
She's getting married.

383
00:14:03,091 --> 00:14:06,325
We have to save them all,
even the sad and lonely ones.

384
00:14:09,531 --> 00:14:13,750
Is there another Dr. Grey
you thought I should ask out?

385
00:14:16,004 --> 00:14:18,621
<i>Okay, just relax
and try not to move, okay?</i>

386
00:14:18,706 --> 00:14:21,424
I haven't relaxed
in two years.

387
00:14:21,509 --> 00:14:23,426
My mother used to say, "I hope
you have children someday",

388
00:14:23,511 --> 00:14:25,829
and they're as awful to you
as you were to me."

389
00:14:25,914 --> 00:14:27,664
And I'd say,
"Joke's on you, lady.

390
00:14:27,749 --> 00:14:29,132
I'm never having kids."

391
00:14:29,217 --> 00:14:30,333
<i>And then Cynthia died,</i>

392
00:14:30,418 --> 00:14:33,870
and now I have
her two human tornadoes.

393
00:14:33,955 --> 00:14:35,805
They're loud,
and they're smelly,

394
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:38,174
and they think
fart jokes are hilarious,

395
00:14:38,259 --> 00:14:40,192
and they never stop eating.

396
00:14:41,195 --> 00:14:45,381
I love them,
but they are disgusting.

397
00:14:45,466 --> 00:14:47,050
I think I owe my mom
an apology.

398
00:14:47,135 --> 00:14:48,351
Yeah, me too.

399
00:14:48,436 --> 00:14:49,486
Whoa.

400
00:14:49,571 --> 00:14:51,421
Her transverse colon is...
Is huge.

401
00:14:51,506 --> 00:14:54,224
Toxic megacolon
with peritoneal signs.

402
00:14:54,309 --> 00:14:55,558
We're gonna need to
get her to the O.R.

403
00:14:55,643 --> 00:14:57,927
before her bowel perfs,
okay?

404
00:14:58,012 --> 00:14:59,562
I was hoping,
if we start medially,

405
00:14:59,647 --> 00:15:01,197
we could remove the tumor
en bloc.

406
00:15:02,383 --> 00:15:04,133
Ah...
It's not working.

407
00:15:04,218 --> 00:15:05,335
I know. Just...

408
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:07,737
Let's try coming
from the inferior side.

409
00:15:07,822 --> 00:15:09,873
Maybe if you approach it
superiorly...

410
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:11,190
I am.

411
00:15:13,227 --> 00:15:14,511
Yeah,
it's still not working.

412
00:15:14,596 --> 00:15:16,212
You know,
I can see that, Shepherd.

413
00:15:16,297 --> 00:15:17,413
That's why
we're practicing.

414
00:15:17,498 --> 00:15:18,615
And at this rate,
we will be ready

415
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,383
in, what...
Five years?

416
00:15:20,468 --> 00:15:22,452
Don't take your baby daddy drama
out on our tumor baby.

417
00:15:22,537 --> 00:15:24,387
We can do this.

418
00:15:27,508 --> 00:15:29,325
Consult in the O.R.
I'll be right back.

419
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:31,694
Wh-What... You're...
You're leaving?

420
00:15:31,779 --> 00:15:35,798
Do me a favor and come back
with a little positivity!

421
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,709
It's quite a crowd.

422
00:15:46,794 --> 00:15:49,245
Quite a surgery.

423
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:51,648
It sounds really complicated.
I hope it goes well.

424
00:15:51,733 --> 00:15:55,385
Well, if you thought you might
be performing your last surgery,

425
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:57,220
wouldn't you want to
go out with a bang?

426

428
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:02,191
She's symptomatic.
She's in pain.

429
00:16:03,811 --> 00:16:05,128
This is not
a simple surgery.

430
00:16:05,213 --> 00:16:07,063
I mean, do you think
this is a good idea?

431
00:16:07,148 --> 00:16:09,933
I think
she's Catherine Fox.

432
00:16:10,018 --> 00:16:12,201
I think...

433
00:16:12,286 --> 00:16:14,437
she's gonna
make her mark here.

434
00:16:14,522 --> 00:16:18,374
And I think she has
a stellar team by her side.

435
00:16:18,459 --> 00:16:19,842

Spleen is out.

Bleeding in the left-upper
quadrant is controlled,

but it must be coming
from somewhere.

448
00:16:49,357 --> 00:16:50,907
- How many units have we gone through?
- Eleven.

449
00:16:50,992 --> 00:16:52,342
I'm gonna clamp
the internal iliac,

450
00:16:52,427 --> 00:16:53,776
try to slow the bleeding.
Mmhmm.

Parker,
just so you're clear,

452
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:56,512
we would have gone through
fewer units

453
00:16:56,597 --> 00:16:58,448
had we stabilized her
in the E.R.

454
00:16:58,533 --> 00:16:59,949
Yes, Dr. Gray.

455
00:17:00,034 --> 00:17:01,751
- Retraction here, Nico.
- Got it.

456
00:17:01,836 --> 00:17:03,586
A pelvic binder
tamponades the bleeding...

457
00:17:03,671 --> 00:17:04,954
It's a very simple
standard of care.

458

- Yes, ma'am.
- More retraction.

459
00:17:07,075 --> 00:17:08,491
How did you even
become a doctor

460
00:17:08,576 --> 00:17:11,127
with this sort of "everything'll
work itself out" attitude?

461
00:17:11,212 --> 00:17:12,929
I became a doctor
the way everyone does, Grey.

462
00:17:13,014 --> 00:17:14,631
I worked my ass off,
I went to med school...

463
00:17:14,716 --> 00:17:16,165
He became a doctor
because he got cancer...

464
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:18,101
Jo, that's not
your story to tell.

465
00:17:18,186 --> 00:17:20,503
Sorry. But he's...
He's not a lightweight,

466

Thank you.

Check this out, Parker.

470
00:17:27,729 --> 00:17:29,712
You want to make sure
you pack below the pelvic brim.

471
00:17:29,797 --> 00:17:31,014
That's where
you're gonna run into

472
00:17:31,099 --> 00:17:32,515
a lot of the
nasty vascular variants

473
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,650
like the crown of death.

474
00:17:33,735 --> 00:17:35,284
I had a hunch
when I saw the X-ray,

475
00:17:35,369 --> 00:17:37,220
and I typically do use
a pelvic binder,

476
00:17:37,305 --> 00:17:38,388
but in this case,
it could've caused

477
00:17:38,473 --> 00:17:41,157
the internally rotated side
to be crushed inward,

478
00:17:41,242 --> 00:17:42,458
causing
even further damage.

479
00:17:42,543 --> 00:17:45,061
And you couldn't have
just said that in the E.R.?

480
00:17:45,146 --> 00:17:48,097
I guess I could've, but
I didn't realize part of my job

481
00:17:48,182 --> 00:17:49,565
was convincing you
I belonged here.

482
00:17:51,753 --> 00:17:53,269
I thought
I just had the flu

483
00:17:53,354 --> 00:17:54,737
and the antibiotics
would knock it out.

484
00:17:54,822 --> 00:17:55,938
No, no.
The antibiotics wiped out

485
00:17:56,023 --> 00:17:57,640
the good bacteria
in your intestine,

486
00:17:57,725 --> 00:17:58,941
which caused
severe inflammation

487
00:17:59,026 --> 00:17:59,976
that made you pass out.

488
00:18:00,061 --> 00:18:00,977
But we caught it
just in time.

489
00:18:01,062 --> 00:18:02,211
Just in time?

490
00:18:02,296 --> 00:18:04,113
Like, before it killed me?

491
00:18:04,198 --> 00:18:05,948
Oh, God. I-I...
I-I can't die.

492
00:18:06,033 --> 00:18:08,384
Those boys
can't lose another parent.

493
00:18:08,469 --> 00:18:09,652
Eli just got to the point

494
00:18:09,737 --> 00:18:11,454
where he's not
crying at night.

495
00:18:11,539 --> 00:18:12,622
They... They need me.

496
00:18:12,707 --> 00:18:13,956
They need...

497
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:15,191
Okay, the bowel
seems to have ruptured.

498
00:18:15,276 --> 00:18:17,293
Let's, uh, get her
intubated and prepped.

499
00:18:17,378 --> 00:18:18,494
She's moving too much.

500
00:18:18,579 --> 00:18:20,663
Okay, let's push
100 of propofol with 100 of sux.

501
00:18:20,748 --> 00:18:23,833
- Already on it.
- Good.

502
00:18:23,918 --> 00:18:26,002
What?
I-I... Oops.

503
00:18:26,087 --> 00:18:27,870
Oh, my God.

504
00:18:27,955 --> 00:18:29,038
Oh, God, did you...

505
00:18:29,123 --> 00:18:31,040
I'm so sorry.

506
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:32,909
Okay, everybody, stop!
Listen to me.

507
00:18:32,994 --> 00:18:35,344
The propofol and sux had just
been accidentally injected

508
00:18:35,429 --> 00:18:37,346
into my IV, which means
I have about 30 seconds

509
00:18:37,431 --> 00:18:38,715
until I will be paralyzed.

510
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,816
So let's page the chief.

511
00:18:39,901 --> 00:18:41,217
DeLuca,
start the surgery, stat.

512
00:18:41,302 --> 00:18:42,785
Uh, I'm gonna need somebody
to put a tube in me,

513
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:44,454
because once I am down,
I'm gonna lose my airway,

514
00:18:44,539 --> 00:18:46,389
and if I can't breathe,
then I will die.

515
00:18:46,474 --> 00:18:48,424
I'd also appreciate it
if somebody could help me

516
00:18:48,509 --> 00:18:50,009
by breaking my fa...

517
00:18:54,874 --> 00:18:56,659
- Patient's intubated.
- Okay, Schmitt, look at me.

518
00:18:56,744 --> 00:18:57,893
Don't rock

00:40:18,157 --> 00:40:19,607
I don't dislike you.

1045
00:40:22,561 --> 00:40:25,279
Which is an improvement
from this morning, right?

1046
00:40:27,266 --> 00:40:29,250
I won't be offended
if you have to check that.

1047
00:40:29,335 --> 00:40:31,152
I'm gonna give myself
a moment.

I have figured out
why you run so much, though.

1051
00:40:37,576 --> 00:40:40,394
You eat more junk food
than any surgeon I've ever met.

1052
00:40:40,479 --> 00:40:43,831
One perk of being
a cancer kid...

1053
00:40:43,916 --> 00:40:46,167
I get to eat
whatever I want,

1054
