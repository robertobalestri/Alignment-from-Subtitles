<i>Anesthesiology is a lot more
challenging than it looks...</i>

2
00:00:05,858 --> 00:00:07,257
<i>..because it's mostly math.</i>

3
00:00:07,342 --> 00:00:09,717
Environment
affects health.

4
00:00:09,803 --> 00:00:11,256
And I want to quantify it.

5
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:13,092
See if we can have
a positive impact

6
00:00:13,178 --> 00:00:15,615
on patient health
pre- and post-op,

7
00:00:15,701 --> 00:00:17,701
even reduce the need
for heart surgeries.

8
00:00:17,888 --> 00:00:19,677
What kind of environments?

9
00:00:19,991 --> 00:00:21,476
<i><font color=#ff80ff>- ♪ One, two, whatcha gonna do? ♪</font>

<i>their estimated blood volume,
their lung function...</i>

11
00:00:24,099 --> 00:00:26,256
<i>all these variables
have to be accounted for.</i>

12
00:00:26,507 --> 00:00:29,256
Plant life
improves physical well-being.

13
00:00:29,342 --> 00:00:32,529
It decreases anxiety
and lowers blood pressure.

14
00:00:32,616 --> 00:00:34,225
Increases attentiveness.

15
00:00:34,311 --> 00:00:36,795
Parker, leave that tree
by the window.

16
00:00:36,881 --> 00:00:38,701
I want to forget
that we are in the city.

17
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:40,037
This is a jungle.

18
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:42,429
<i>- <font color=#ff80ff>♪ Can you feel that rhythm ♪</font>

<i>to suspend a person

20
00:00:45,271 --> 00:00:48,170
Full-body exposure
to high levels of blue light

21
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:50,069
reduces systolic blood pressure

22
00:00:50,155 --> 00:00:53,678
the same amount
as it is reduced in certain drug trials.

23
00:00:53,833 --> 00:00:55,427
So this could replace medicine?

24
00:00:55,553 --> 00:00:56,803
I want to find out.

25
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:59,084
<i>And if one of those variables
is off,</i>

26
00:01:00,029 --> 00:01:01,907
<i>you might wake up
in the middle of your surgery.</i>

27
00:01:01,992 --> 00:01:03,756
So, we all know
the neurological benefits

28
00:01:03,842 --> 00:01:04,889
of puzzles and games.

29
00:01:04,975 --> 00:01:06,623
I want to see
if those same benefits

30
00:01:06,709 --> 00:01:07,826
spread throughout the body,

31
00:01:07,927 --> 00:01:09,872
which brings us
to door number three.

00:01:10,052 --> 00:01:11,670
<i>Or never wake up at all.</i></font>

33
00:01:11,756 --> 00:01:13,920
I see you've found
the game room, Dr. Bailey.

34
00:01:14,054 --> 00:01:15,577
How are you feeling?

35
00:01:15,662 --> 00:01:18,084
Oh, my stress levels
have never been better.

36
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:20,506
Ah, they never give you the long,
skinny piece!

37
00:01:20,592 --> 00:01:21,889
Why do they do that?!

38
00:01:21,975 --> 00:01:24,475
So, any volunteers?

42
00:01:30,185 --> 00:01:31,811
Any, uh,
word from your dad?

43
00:01:31,897 --> 00:01:33,147
Have you heard anything
or...

44
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:35,166
Uh, no.
No, I haven't.

45
00:01:36,725 --> 00:01:38,795
I have some rounds.
I should probably...

46
00:01:38,904 --> 00:01:40,115
Yeah, sure.

47
00:01:44,678 --> 00:01:46,475

Hey, good news... I can make it
to the birthing class today.

50
00:01:51,155 --> 00:01:52,803
I thought you were
covering the ER for me.

51
00:01:52,889 --> 00:01:54,123
You know, so could attend.

52
00:01:54,241 --> 00:01:55,343
Uh, Webber's got it,

53
00:01:55,429 --> 00:01:57,147
but if you'd rather
I didn't go, then...

54
00:01:57,233 --> 00:01:59,055
- No, it's fine. It's great. Uh...
- Okay, great.

55
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:01,616
Well, I'll do my post-ops,
and then I'll see you up there?

56
00:02:03,444 --> 00:02:04,992
I should have told him
you were coming, too.

57
00:02:05,077 --> 00:02:06,570
Oh, it's fine.
It's better than fine...

58
00:02:06,655 --> 00:02:08,522
it's what I secretly
was hoping for all along.

59
00:02:08,608 --> 00:02:11,210
I think he and I are about
this close to becoming besties.

60
00:02:11,296 --> 00:02:13,444
You're joking,
but it's what I'm rooting for.

61
00:02:13,601 --> 00:02:14,960
Hey, I got to go change into my

62
00:02:15,053 --> 00:02:16,569
"supportive boyfriend" clothes.
You...

63
00:02:16,718 --> 00:02:18,632
- You good?
- Yes, thank you.

64
00:02:21,062 --> 00:02:22,116
Ow!

65
00:02:22,582 --> 00:02:24,452
Ow.

66
00:02:24,858 --> 00:02:28,045
All right, move off
whatever organ you're on, soldier.

67
00:02:28,131 --> 00:02:30,046
Okay.

68
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:32,889
Ah. At ease.

69
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:39,898
<i>This is Jo. Leave a mess...</i>

70
00:02:46,828 --> 00:02:47,990
What are you doing in here?

71
00:02:48,077 --> 00:02:49,139
Hey. Research.

72
00:02:49,225 --> 00:02:50,850
I needed
a change of scenery,

73
00:02:50,936 --> 00:02:52,147
and, you know,
I have to say,

74
00:02:52,233 --> 00:02:54,045
the plants are actually
very soothing.

75
00:02:54,131 --> 00:02:55,295
What are you working on?

76
00:02:57,334 --> 00:02:58,390
What is it?

77
00:02:58,483 --> 00:03:01,295
Ingestible diagnostic device.

78
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:02,944
- Ingestible?
- Mm-hmm.

79
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:04,741
I mean, I think,
I don't know.

80
00:03:04,827 --> 00:03:06,827
It came to me in a dream,
sort of, so...

81
00:03:08,475 --> 00:03:10,858
How's Jo's trip going?
Did she meet her mom?

82
00:03:10,944 --> 00:03:12,744
I don't know.
I haven't talked to her.

83
00:03:12,881 --> 00:03:14,077
How's DeLuca?

84
00:03:14,467 --> 00:03:16,123
Where'd you say she was
going, Pittsburgh?

85
00:03:16,209 --> 00:03:17,209
Yeah.

86
00:03:17,295 --> 00:03:19,842
Is he still being weird?
'Cause he's on my service today.

87
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:21,412
Why do you keep changing
the subject?

88
00:03:21,497 --> 00:03:22,600
Why do you?

89
00:03:24,518 --> 00:03:26,420
She ...
She's not answering her phone.

90
00:03:26,514 --> 00:03:28,100
She hasn't texted all day.
I'm worried.

91
00:03:28,873 --> 00:03:31,452
Well, okay, so, she's probably
just gonna come home

92
00:03:31,538 --> 00:03:32,858
and tell you everything.

93
00:03:32,944 --> 00:03:34,012
What about the Italian?

94
00:03:34,097 --> 00:03:35,772
Big blowup with the dad.

95
00:03:35,858 --> 00:03:37,022
Big.

96
00:03:37,537 --> 00:03:39,287
Does not want my input.

97
00:03:39,974 --> 00:03:42,295
- Ohh.
- So I'm just trying to give him a minute.

98
00:03:42,452 --> 00:03:44,148
Your boyfriend's being weird,

99
00:03:44,233 --> 00:03:45,897
and, uh,
you're hiding out in plants?

100
00:03:45,983 --> 00:03:48,303
Well, if I was hiding out,
you wouldn't be able to find me.

101
00:03:52,694 --> 00:03:54,795
Blue light lowers
blood pressure?

102
00:03:54,881 --> 00:03:56,084
Significantly.

103
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:58,178
And some studies
suggest that

104
00:03:58,264 --> 00:04:00,194
it could even
improve your mood, so...

105
00:04:00,522 --> 00:04:02,498
And I'm not saying
it's a cure-all or anything,

106
00:04:02,584 --> 00:04:04,466
but you might want
to spend some time...

107
00:04:05,858 --> 00:04:08,428
Okay, the room doesn't work
that fast...

108
00:04:09,084 --> 00:04:10,303
What's going on?

109
00:04:10,498 --> 00:04:11,522
Nothing.

110
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:12,975
Nothing?

111
00:04:13,561 --> 00:04:15,178
'Cause the last time
I saw you

112
00:04:15,311 --> 00:04:16,546
there was
a fair amount of crying,

113
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:19,131
and exactly
zero chair spinning.

114
00:04:19,636 --> 00:04:20,873
Fine.

115
00:04:21,144 --> 00:04:23,459
I might have had
some insanely good sex

116
00:04:23,545 --> 00:04:25,350
at the conference
in San Diego.

117
00:04:25,436 --> 00:04:27,202
Oh, wait, what?

118
00:04:27,288 --> 00:04:28,342
You had insane sex

119
00:04:28,428 --> 00:04:30,077
with a complete stranger
in San Diego?

120
00:04:30,163 --> 00:04:31,514
Not a complete stranger.

121
00:04:31,678 --> 00:04:33,741
And not insane sex.
Insanely good sex.

122
00:04:33,827 --> 00:04:35,757
And it helped my mood
a lot more than this blue room.

123
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:38,288
Oh, okay, so,
like a rebound.

124
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:40,740
- More like muscle bound.
- Oh, oh, oh, oh!

125
00:04:40,826 --> 00:04:42,045
Knock, knock.

126
00:04:42,131 --> 00:04:43,858
- Hi.
- Dr. Pierce.

127
00:04:43,944 --> 00:04:45,077
Uh...

128
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:48,412
I took a look at your
sternal reconstruction thing,

129
00:04:48,498 --> 00:04:49,467
and I e-mailed you some...

130
00:04:49,553 --> 00:04:50,710
- some thoughts.
- Oh, great. Thank you.

131
00:04:50,795 --> 00:04:51,756
Yeah, sorry it took me
so long...

132
00:04:51,842 --> 00:04:53,936
I was at a conference
in San Diego.

133
00:04:56,359 --> 00:04:57,608
Uh, oh!

134
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:02,858
- Nice room.
- Yeah.

135
00:05:02,944 --> 00:05:04,147
Very blue.

136
00:05:04,366 --> 00:05:05,470
Yeah.

137
00:05:05,944 --> 00:05:08,139
It's very cool.
Dr. Shepherd.

138
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:13,076
- Oh, my God.
- It was a one-time thing!

139
00:05:13,162 --> 00:05:14,404
That is it!
I just needed

140

some pain management.</font>

141
00:05:16,209 --> 00:05:17,843
Does this room change colors?
Does it do pink?

142
00:05:17,928 --> 00:05:19,748
- No.
- Okay, then.

143
00:05:23,841 --> 00:05:26,537
So, Mom just decided not to
start back to work this week.

144
00:05:26,623 --> 00:05:28,615
You don't know if she's in pain,
or is she tired?

145
00:05:28,701 --> 00:05:29,788
She didn't give me
any reason.

146
00:05:29,873 --> 00:05:32,342
She waved her hand
and said "cancer card."

147
00:05:32,428 --> 00:05:33,858
That's her
new shorthand for...

148
00:05:33,944 --> 00:05:35,530
- "Stop questioning me."
- Exactly.

Yeah. Well...

11-year-old girl
with chronic pancreatitis. Ouch.

169
00:06:11,803 --> 00:06:13,343
And I've known this kid
since she was 5.

170
00:06:13,428 --> 00:06:15,318
Today, she's getting
a total pancreatectomy.

171

And you're gonna give her
the good news.

- Why me?
- 'Cause I'm a nice guy.

What... you don't feel
like being a hero today?

174
00:06:24,239 --> 00:06:26,490
Are you solving for "Y"?
It's 11.

00:06:26,676 --> 00:06:28,293
Um... Unh-unh.

176
00:06:28,495 --> 00:06:29,495
It's not.

177
00:06:29,732 --> 00:06:32,873
I took two years of Integral
and Differential Calc.

178
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:35,326
I was going into theoretical math.
It's 11.

179
00:06:35,412 --> 00:06:38,623
I just do this for fun.
And it's 14.

180
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:40,366
Shut up!

181
00:06:40,599 --> 00:06:42,123
Sorry. Sorry.

182
00:06:42,255 --> 00:06:44,412
But how are you <i>that</i> good at math?</font>

183
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:46,130
Qadri, let's do it.

184
00:06:47,127 --> 00:06:49,014
This is Nora Hillridge,
age 11.

185
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,303
She was diagnosed
with hereditary pancreatitis

186
00:06:51,389 --> 00:06:52,389
at age 5.

187
00:06:52,544 --> 00:06:54,046
She's been hospitalized
for the last six months.

188
00:06:54,131 --> 00:06:55,548
And why haven't
we helped her?

189
00:06:55,951 --> 00:06:58,342
A number of criteria
need to align

190
00:06:58,428 --> 00:06:59,778
in order to perform
her surgery...

191
00:06:59,897 --> 00:07:02,584
her APACHE II score
should be below 4,

192
00:07:02,826 --> 00:07:06,053
her amylase, lipase, LDH,
and base deficit

193
00:07:06,139 --> 00:07:07,389
should be within normal limits.

194
00:07:07,475 --> 00:07:09,460
Her fasting glucose and
C peptide levels should be...

195
00:07:09,545 --> 00:07:10,967
All right.
All right, got it.

196
00:07:11,053 --> 00:07:12,103
DeLuca?

197
00:07:12,247 --> 00:07:15,451
The hope has always been
to do a total pancreatectomy

198
00:07:15,537 --> 00:07:16,982
with in islet autotransplantation,

199
00:07:17,068 --> 00:07:20,412
so she won't get diabetes
or even need Insulin shots.

200
00:07:20,498 --> 00:07:23,216
And today,
all the elements have aligned.

201
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,841
Your numbers are perfect,
Nora, and today...

202
00:07:25,927 --> 00:07:27,618
- No.
- ..we are taking you to surgery!

203
00:07:27,704 --> 00:07:29,254
Ahh!

204
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,220
Nora! </font>

205
00:07:31,337 --> 00:07:33,556
Oh, you can go back
to school!

206
00:07:36,777 --> 00:07:38,327
How long
will I have to recover?

207
00:07:38,423 --> 00:07:40,033
We'll have you out
of here before you know it.

208
00:07:40,118 --> 00:07:41,868
Thank you, thank you.

209
00:07:41,954 --> 00:07:44,438
- Thank you! Thank you!
- I...

210
00:07:44,675 --> 00:07:45,858
Uh, okay.

211
00:07:52,771 --> 00:07:54,966
Major Altman?
I didn't see you'd signed up.

212
00:07:55,098 --> 00:07:56,193
Does this room work?

213
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:58,337
Studies show that 400 nanometers
of blue light...

214
00:07:58,422 --> 00:08:00,576
I just need to know if it works!

215
00:08:01,018 --> 00:08:02,501
I apologize for that.

216
00:08:02,696 --> 00:08:04,909
I started to feel a little sore
about an hour ago,

217
00:08:04,995 --> 00:08:06,279
and

218
00:08:06,407 --> 00:08:08,825
I'm hoping that it's just stress,

219
00:08:08,911 --> 00:08:12,904
and if Pierce is onto
something, then I-I just...

220
00:08:14,443 --> 00:08:16,404
- Okay. Okay, nope.
- Ohh.

221
00:08:16,551 --> 00:08:18,295
Nope, not stress.

222
00:08:18,381 --> 00:08:19,857
Feels more like...

223
00:08:19,951 --> 00:08:23,094
like my body is pushing out
all of my organs.

224
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:23,990
I'll get a wheelchair.

225
00:08:24,076 --> 00:08:25,972
- Page OB! And Owen Hunt.
- Okay.

226
00:08:26,058 --> 00:08:28,084
Stay right where you are, soldier!

227
00:08:28,698 --> 00:08:30,099
Not you! You go!

228
00:08:30,185 --> 00:08:32,060
Okay, okay, no, no. Okay, no.

229
00:08:32,146 --> 00:08:35,099
Okay, okay, wait, no, no.</font>

Okay.

You think Teddy wants,
uh, soft or firm?

234
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:50,315
Uh, I think Teddy has
a partner for this class,

235
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,058
so you can head out.

236
00:08:51,144 --> 00:08:53,223
Okay, everyone,
on your mats.

237
00:08:53,309 --> 00:08:54,996

You want to hold
or be held?

240
00:08:57,715 --> 00:08:59,176
Oh.

241
00:08:59,816 --> 00:09:00,918
Uh, I gotta go.

242
00:09:01,004 --> 00:09:02,895
Y...

243
00:09:03,129 --> 00:09:06,176
He's very busy and,
uh, important, so...

244
00:09:06,371 --> 00:09:07,537
I'll just...

245
00:09:08,098 --> 00:09:10,543
What is happening down there?
Am I dilated? Effaced?

246
00:09:10,629 --> 00:09:11,551
Is there a foot sticking out?

247
00:09:11,637 --> 00:09:13,231
I need answers.</font>

248
00:09:13,317 --> 00:09:14,449
You can scoot up.

249
00:09:14,707 --> 00:09:16,124
- You're not in labor.
- Okay.

250
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:18,560
Your contractions are sporadic
and not very strong.

251
00:09:18,646 --> 00:09:19,715
Not very strong?

252
00:09:19,801 --> 00:09:21,192
What do they feel like
when they're strong?

253
00:09:21,277 --> 00:09:23,528
You do, however,
have cervical insufficiency.

254
00:09:23,683 --> 00:09:26,457
- Okay, where's the button?
- What button?

255
00:09:26,543 --> 00:09:28,285
I'm putting myself
in Trendelenburg.

256
00:09:28,389 --> 00:09:30,512
Gravity might help
prevent preterm labor.

257
00:09:30,598 --> 00:09:32,934
How about you let me
put you in Trendelenburg?

258
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:35,169
How about you push some meds
to stop these contractions

259
00:09:35,254 --> 00:09:37,772
and stop pretending like
now isn't the time to panic?

260
00:09:37,858 --> 00:09:39,465
I assure you, Dr. Altman,

261
00:09:39,551 --> 00:09:42,340
I'll do everything I can
to keep the baby inside,

262
00:09:42,426 --> 00:09:43,348
and if she's born today...

263
00:09:43,434 --> 00:09:44,913
No, no, no, no.

264
00:09:44,999 --> 00:09:46,612
She's not ready, and,
frankly, neither am I...

265
00:09:46,697 --> 00:09:49,015
Wow, this is really not comfortable.</font>

266
00:09:49,101 --> 00:09:50,340
What the hell happened?

267
00:09:50,426 --> 00:09:51,887
Hey.

268
00:09:52,563 --> 00:09:54,066
You okay?

269
00:09:54,828 --> 00:09:56,957
<i>Dr. Campbell
to the Stepdown Unit.</i>

270
00:09:57,043 --> 00:09:58,494
I thought we agreed
we weren't gonna tell people

271
00:09:58,579 --> 00:10:00,199
- about what happened?
- We did.

272
00:10:00,285 --> 00:10:02,262
Why did you tell Maggie
you were in San Diego?

273
00:10:02,348 --> 00:10:03,466
'Cause I was. At a conference.

274
00:10:03,551 --> 00:10:05,636
Well, I told her
I had sex at a conference.

275
00:10:05,721 --> 00:10:07,427
Wait, so you
told her about the sex,

276
00:10:07,512 --> 00:10:09,272
but I'm in trouble
for mentioning a location?

277
00:10:09,598 --> 00:10:11,981
Okay, can I just reiterate
that this was a one-time thing?

278
00:10:12,067 --> 00:10:13,117
I mean, it was just...

279
00:10:13,267 --> 00:10:14,246
Pain management, like you said.

280
00:10:14,332 --> 00:10:16,168
For acute pain, not chronic.

281
00:10:16,254 --> 00:10:18,035
One dose. Do not refill.

282
00:10:18,889 --> 00:10:20,629
Ew, sorry. I'm just saying,

283
00:10:20,841 --> 00:10:22,091
to be safe, I think we should probably

284
00:10:22,176 --> 00:10:23,692
steer clear of each other for a while.

285
00:10:23,777 --> 00:10:25,505
- You really think that's necessary?
- I do. Because...

286
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:28,543
- ...pheromones.
- What about them?

287
00:10:29,137 --> 00:10:30,941
- I really like yours.
- Okay, then.

288
00:10:31,027 --> 00:10:32,176
I'll avoid you completely.

289
00:10:34,265 --> 00:10:35,645
- You paged?
- You paged?

290
00:10:36,023 --> 00:10:39,121
Oh, Dr. Shepherd, uh, Dr. Lincoln,

291
00:10:39,207 --> 00:10:41,496
Kari Donnelly...
she rolled her snowmobile.

292
00:10:41,582 --> 00:10:42,934
Not on purpose.

293
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:44,363
Now, the films just came up,

294
00:10:44,449 --> 00:10:46,410
but I need to help Dr. Avery.

295
00:10:47,796 --> 00:10:49,770
Toby says I was driving too fast.

296
00:10:49,856 --> 00:10:51,339
I tell them,

297
00:10:51,565 --> 00:10:53,282
why have a throttle
if you don't crank it?

298
00:10:53,368 --> 00:10:54,543
Well, this may be why.

299
00:10:54,643 --> 00:10:56,887
Film shows fractures at C4 and 5.

300
00:10:57,011 --> 00:10:59,809
Is that bad? How bad is it?

301
00:10:59,895 --> 00:11:02,652
We won't know how bad it is
until we get some scans.

302
00:11:02,738 --> 00:11:04,285
- Can you feel this?
- Yes.

303
00:11:04,371 --> 00:11:05,620
That's good.

304
00:11:05,717 --> 00:11:07,629
- I'd like to take her for an MRI.
- I'd like to get her an MRI.

305
00:11:10,568 --> 00:11:11,818
Oh, God.

306
00:11:13,494 --> 00:11:15,387
Hey, uh, how we doing here?

307
00:11:15,568 --> 00:11:17,426
No palpable pulse in the arm,

308
00:11:17,512 --> 00:11:19,582
getting a weak Doppler signal,
it sounds like.

309
00:11:19,668 --> 00:11:21,618
Got some arterial compromise, as well.

310
00:11:21,732 --> 00:11:23,340
I-Is my mom okay?

311
00:11:23,527 --> 00:11:25,746
Oh, she's stable... we'll...
we'll know more soon, okay?

312
00:11:25,957 --> 00:11:28,129
Let's make sure you have
no other injuries.

313
00:11:28,856 --> 00:11:30,668
Snowmobiling was her idea.

314
00:11:30,926 --> 00:11:33,363
She's always pushing me
to face my fears.

315
00:11:33,449 --> 00:11:36,590
She was right.
It was a lot of fun.

316
00:11:37,389 --> 00:11:38,805
God, why is she always right?

317
00:11:38,891 --> 00:11:40,035
I know how you feel.

318
00:11:40,121 --> 00:11:42,939
I mean, fun till
she swerved to miss a tree

319
00:11:43,025 --> 00:11:45,418
and flipped us five times.

320
00:11:46,238 --> 00:11:48,660
Hey, uh, we should get a CT angio...</font>

321
00:11:48,746 --> 00:11:51,191
...to determine the location
of her vascular injuries.

322
00:11:51,321 --> 00:11:53,074
- "Their."
- Excuse me?

323
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,121
"Their" injury, not <i>"her."</i>

324
00:11:55,207 --> 00:11:56,657
I'm a <i>"they."</i>

325
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,488
I'm gender-queer.

326
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:00,824
- Non-binary.
- Got it.

327
00:12:00,925 --> 00:12:02,875
Thank you for letting us know
your pronouns.

328
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,418
Their preferred pronouns
are "they" and "them."

329
00:12:05,504 --> 00:12:08,777
Oh, okay, uh, yes.
Uh, w-well, a-all right, then.

330
00:12:08,863 --> 00:12:13,137
Um, w-well, let's get you... all?

331
00:12:13,293 --> 00:12:14,863
"You" is fine.

332
00:12:14,949 --> 00:12:17,543
Great.
Well, your ultrasound is fine.

333
00:12:17,629 --> 00:12:19,082
Let's get you up to CT.

334
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:25,918
This is really
why you paged me?

335
00:12:26,004 --> 00:12:27,004
Just read.

336
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,121
"Glenda mapped a town
using a scale

337
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:32,324
that was 5 inches
and equals 1 yard.

338
00:12:32,692 --> 00:12:34,509
What scale factor does her drawing use?"

339
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:35,677
Okay, one yard equals three,

340
00:12:35,762 --> 00:12:38,223
divided by seven and 1/5...

341
00:12:38,309 --> 00:12:41,137
5 to 7.2 is the ratio.

342
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,684
You didn't write!
You need to write.

343
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:45,290
- Let's go again.
- Okay, okay.

344
00:12:45,452 --> 00:12:46,715
Let's get her prepped, guys.

345
00:12:46,801 --> 00:12:48,868
One more, please?
An easy one.

346
00:12:49,447 --> 00:12:50,738
All right.

347
00:12:51,024 --> 00:12:53,942
Okay. "A line L is perpendicular

348
00:12:54,028 --> 00:12:57,379
to the line 2x - 5y - 8 = 0.

349
00:12:57,465 --> 00:12:59,512
What is the slope of the line L?"

350
00:12:59,602 --> 00:13:01,385
That was supposed to be an <i>easy</i> one?

351
00:13:01,471 --> 00:13:03,172
Hey, Nora.

352
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:06,176
I, uh... I got some bad news.

353
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:07,824
I just ran your pre-op blood work,

354
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:08,910
and I don't know why,

355
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:10,590
but your glucose level has shot way up.

356
00:13:10,871 --> 00:13:13,199
No! She was just in the clear!

357
00:13:13,613 --> 00:13:15,926
Was it a lab error this morning,
or what happened?

358
00:13:16,012 --> 00:13:17,020
I'm not sure yet.

359
00:13:17,106 --> 00:13:19,191
The bottom line is, we have to
put you on an Insulin drip

360
00:13:19,276 --> 00:13:20,527
to lower your blood sugar,

361
00:13:20,769 --> 00:13:22,487
which means we have to
postpone your surgery

362
00:13:22,572 --> 00:13:23,653
till we can sort this out.

363
00:13:23,862 --> 00:13:26,115
It's been six months
getting her to this point.

364
00:13:26,271 --> 00:13:28,788
Well, let's just keep
our fingers crossed, okay?

365
00:13:34,967 --> 00:13:36,751
Negative five over two.

366
00:13:37,203 --> 00:13:38,301
Beat you.

367
00:13:41,599 --> 00:13:43,941
I don't know how this happened.
Sorry about this.

368
00:13:44,262 --> 00:13:46,231
Don't be sorry for me.
Be sorry for her.

369
00:13:47,947 --> 00:13:49,660
Did Meredith ask you to do this?

370
00:13:49,857 --> 00:13:50,965
Throw me a bone? Give me a win?

371
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:52,738
Is that what this is?
'Cause I'm good.

372
00:13:52,824 --> 00:13:54,535
I had a bad week, and I moved on.

373
00:13:54,621 --> 00:13:55,922
I don't need any favors.

374
00:14:05,109 --> 00:14:07,145
I've got to get off this case.</font>

375
00:14:09,496 --> 00:14:10,606
Scans are up.

376
00:14:13,589 --> 00:14:16,405
- Bulging disc at C5.
- Crap.

377
00:14:16,498 --> 00:14:17,957
Did you see L-3?

378
00:14:18,043 --> 00:14:19,593
Yeah, L-4 is worse.

379
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:22,230
Total obliteration of the CSF space

380
00:14:22,338 --> 00:14:23,492
and displacement of the cauda.

381
00:14:23,577 --> 00:14:25,981
She could end up paraplegic.

382
00:14:26,648 --> 00:14:29,012
I'd rather not handle
this case on my own.

383
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:32,668
Understood.

384
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:42,408
If you're gonna take up
all my time slots,

385
00:14:42,493 --> 00:14:44,583
could you at least put a cuff on
so I can take your data?

386
00:14:44,668 --> 00:14:46,036
I'm about to beat
the high score.

387
00:14:46,122 --> 00:14:47,934
Which you just set
20 minutes ago.

388
00:14:48,042 --> 00:14:49,583
Oh, then you should've
hooked me up then.

389
00:14:49,668 --> 00:14:51,708
You pressed "restart" before
we could get the cuff on you.

390
00:14:51,793 --> 00:14:52,876
You snooze, you...

391
00:14:52,962 --> 00:14:54,779
Oh, oh, ah!

392
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:57,586
See?! Look what happened!

393
00:14:57,851 --> 00:14:59,207
Ah!

394
00:14:59,309 --> 00:15:01,574
I was wondering if we could
borrow Dr. Schmitt.

395
00:15:01,814 --> 00:15:03,431
- Is it urgent?
- Yes.

396
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:05,699
No. No.

397
00:15:06,403 --> 00:15:07,692
I have a patient
who's a math whiz,

398
00:15:07,777 --> 00:15:09,377
and she's crushing me,
and I need backup.

399
00:15:09,596 --> 00:15:12,270
May I go? In school,
they called me "Numbers."

400
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,840
- But not kindly.
- Yeah, go.

401
00:15:15,254 --> 00:15:16,270
Hold on.

402
00:15:16,356 --> 00:15:19,762
Uh, just how good is
this math whiz?

403
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,652
Yeah, please define "whiz"?

404
00:15:30,316 --> 00:15:33,246
<i><font color=#ff80ff>♪ Oh, my, oh, my baby ♪</font></i>

408
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:53,981
"Insufficient cervix." I mean...

409
00:15:54,067 --> 00:15:55,755
"insufficient" is something
I've never been called

410
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,871
in my entire life.

411
00:15:57,005 --> 00:15:58,996
Are you sure this is
really the best option?

412
00:15:59,113 --> 00:16:01,957
Dr. Altman is following
her own course of treatment.

413
00:16:02,043 --> 00:16:03,960
That being said, um,
I agree with it.

414
00:16:04,045 --> 00:16:06,222
There is no hourglassing
of the membranes anymore,

415
00:16:06,308 --> 00:16:07,988
so I think it's working.

416
00:16:08,216 --> 00:16:09,732
- Um, I'll check on you every hour.
- Okay.

417
00:16:09,817 --> 00:16:11,637
Okay, is there anything
I can do to help, or...

418
00:16:11,722 --> 00:16:14,972
Stay calm and talk to the baby.
Reassure her.

419
00:16:15,113 --> 00:16:16,910
It'll be good for her
to hear your voices.

420
00:16:17,003 --> 00:16:19,558
Okay. Thank you.</font>

421
00:16:27,378 --> 00:16:29,175
Hey there, little one.

422
00:16:29,526 --> 00:16:31,964
We still haven't bought you a crib,

423
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:33,894
but we're almost ready.

424
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:35,019
- Owen.
- Eh...

425
00:16:35,105 --> 00:16:36,025
My face is up here.

426
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:37,103
I'm not talking to you.

427
00:16:38,546 --> 00:16:40,761
And you wait till you meet

428
00:16:40,847 --> 00:16:42,332
your big brother, Leo.

429
00:16:42,417 --> 00:16:44,418
He's got so many toys
to share with you.

430
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:45,855
Uh, okay, you can't use that voice.

431
00:16:49,024 --> 00:16:50,480
This is your dad.

432
00:16:51,793 --> 00:16:53,770
- I'm very pleased to meet you.
- Okay.

433
00:16:53,855 --> 00:16:55,121
- Okay? Okay?
- That's perfect.

434
00:16:55,207 --> 00:16:56,678
Now she'll be afraid to come out.

435
00:16:56,764 --> 00:16:59,550
Pleeeasse stay inside

436
00:16:59,636 --> 00:17:01,402
for another month or two, okay?

437
00:17:01,488 --> 00:17:03,238
- Okay.
- Okay, you're freaking me out now.

438
00:17:05,032 --> 00:17:08,035
1,000 plus 20 plus 30 plus 1,000

439
00:17:08,175 --> 00:17:10,793
plus 1,030 plus 1,000 plus 20 equals...

440
00:17:10,879 --> 00:17:11,777
5,000!

441
00:17:11,863 --> 00:17:13,196
- 4,100!
- 4,100!

442
00:17:13,281 --> 00:17:14,901
What? I call witchcraft!

443
00:17:14,986 --> 00:17:17,011
I got it right!
But she got there first.

444
00:17:17,097 --> 00:17:18,333
I bet you let me win.

445
00:17:18,419 --> 00:17:20,203
Little girl,
ask any of these people

446
00:17:20,288 --> 00:17:22,347
if I ever <i>let anybody win anything.</i>

447
00:17:22,464 --> 00:17:23,506
She hasn't ever.

448
00:17:24,902 --> 00:17:26,668
I give up.
This is embarrassing.

449
00:17:26,824 --> 00:17:28,738
Don't give up,
be on my team.

450
00:17:28,824 --> 00:17:30,066
I don't think
I make the cut.

451
00:17:30,152 --> 00:17:31,652
Come on. Come on.

452
00:17:31,808 --> 00:17:33,016
There you go.</font>

453
00:17:34,202 --> 00:17:35,777
This is so nice of you.

454
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:37,987
True or false...

455
00:17:38,072 --> 00:17:40,011
0.9 repeating equals one?

456
00:17:40,576 --> 00:17:43,995
Okay, wait, I-I-If
3.9 repeating is four...

457
00:17:44,112 --> 00:17:46,222
- Times... Times 10...
- False!

458
00:17:46,308 --> 00:17:47,488
No, no, true!

459
00:17:47,574 --> 00:17:49,152
No, wait, I-It's infinite 9s!

460
00:17:49,246 --> 00:17:50,466
- Oh, Schmitt, shush!
- True.

461
00:17:50,551 --> 00:17:51,701
It's true. Here.

462
00:17:54,844 --> 00:17:56,962
Well, if you do it like that.</font>

463
00:18:00,128 --> 00:18:02,145
Nothing's going on, right?

464
00:18:02,277 --> 00:18:03,727
With my mom?

465
00:18:04,691 --> 00:18:05,887
Nothing I should be worried about?

466
00:18:05,972 --> 00:18:09,185
It's not, like, s-something,
and you're just not telling me?

467
00:18:09,566 --> 00:18:11,074
Now, why would you say that?

468
00:18:11,793 --> 00:18:14,390
Oh, I don't know...
because I blithely assumed

469
00:18:14,475 --> 00:18:16,722
my mother did not have cancer
when, in fact, she did,

470
00:18:16,808 --> 00:18:17,988
and none of you told me.

471
00:18:18,246 --> 00:18:22,464
Well, I found out after you,
if you'll recall.

472
00:18:23,796 --> 00:18:25,957
- Look, I know you're scared, son.
- I'm not scared,

473
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:29,722
all right? I'm just...
concerned.

474
00:18:30,821 --> 00:18:32,324
They're all settled.

475
00:18:35,385 --> 00:18:38,597
Do we really have
to use this plural thing,

476
00:18:38,722 --> 00:18:39,754
even when she can't hear us?

477
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:41,675
While <i>they</i>... they can't hear us.

478
00:18:41,769 --> 00:18:43,853
Okay, yeah.
It's not that complicated.

479
00:18:43,938 --> 00:18:45,121
Not that complicated?

480
00:18:45,206 --> 00:18:46,769
We're talking about
a single entity,

481
00:18:46,855 --> 00:18:47,918
but "they" is plural.

482
00:18:48,004 --> 00:18:50,760
I mean, it requires a plural verb.

483
00:18:51,058 --> 00:18:53,191
Or am I supposed to say, "They is"?

484
00:18:53,277 --> 00:18:55,574
No, look,
if you're in a movie theater

485
00:18:55,699 --> 00:18:57,753
and somebody's coat is left in a seat,

486
00:18:57,839 --> 00:18:58,683
and you bring it to the Usher,

487
00:18:58,769 --> 00:19:00,113
what do you say to the Usher?

488
00:19:00,199 --> 00:19:01,571
Well, a number of things.

489
00:19:01,656 --> 00:19:05,152
Um, I might say,
"Someone left behind a coat,"

490
00:19:05,332 --> 00:19:06,582
or, "I found someone's coat,"

491
00:19:06,668 --> 00:19:08,480
or, "Turn this in to the lost and found."

492
00:19:08,566 --> 00:19:10,380
I might say,
"Somebody left their coat."

493
00:19:10,465 --> 00:19:12,215
Then you'd be grammatically
incorrect.

494
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,667
Ungrammatical.

495
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:16,644
Excuse me?

496
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:20,300
Uh, something's either
grammatical or it's not.

497
00:19:20,394 --> 00:19:21,758
"Grammatically incorrect" is like saying

498
00:19:21,843 --> 00:19:24,227
something is right-wrong.

499
00:19:26,186 --> 00:19:28,064
- Scans are up.
- It's about time.

500
00:19:28,149 --> 00:19:30,933
All right, Helm,
what do you see?

501
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:33,970
Absence of flow in
the mid-brachial artery.

502
00:19:34,152 --> 00:19:35,905
Okay, we need to get her up
to the OR.

503
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:37,324
Really?

504
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:41,277
Okay, them, them, them!

505
00:19:41,746 --> 00:19:43,074
Can we go now?

506
00:19:43,819 --> 00:19:45,402
Almighty...

507
00:19:45,488 --> 00:19:48,017
Now I feel pins and needles.

508
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:49,833
You still feeling this?

509
00:19:49,926 --> 00:19:51,191
I do...

510
00:19:51,873 --> 00:19:53,307
but less.

511
00:19:54,408 --> 00:19:56,668
Why am I...
Why am I feeling it less?

512
00:19:56,754 --> 00:19:59,683
Kari, you suffered two injuries
to your spine.

513
00:19:59,863 --> 00:20:01,764
The lower one is quite severe.

514
00:20:02,066 --> 00:20:04,378
Your neuro exam is getting
progressively worse,

515
00:20:04,464 --> 00:20:05,644
so we need to get in there

516
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:08,304
before you are paralyzed
from the waist down.

517
00:20:08,668 --> 00:20:10,206
I might become paralyzed?

518
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:12,222
- No...
- We're gonna do everything we can

519
00:20:12,308 --> 00:20:14,177
to reverse
the compression of the nerves.

520
00:20:14,262 --> 00:20:16,816
Oh, God, please...

521
00:20:20,214 --> 00:20:22,410
I can't do a wheelchair.

522
00:20:22,879 --> 00:20:24,853
I never sit!

523
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,027
Go... Go ask Toby.

524
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:33,480
W-We're supposed to do
a sprint triathlon next month.

525
00:20:33,629 --> 00:20:36,207
We are going to do
everything that we can.

526
00:20:39,793 --> 00:20:41,237
Your boyfriend's being a jerk.

527
00:20:41,322 --> 00:20:42,705
What did he do?</font>

528
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:44,722
Oh, wait. None of my business.

529
00:20:45,043 --> 00:20:47,675
Uh, he has to work
this all out by himself.

530
00:20:47,761 --> 00:20:48,981
I was just trying to do him
a favor.

531
00:20:49,066 --> 00:20:50,871
Well, I'm not getting involved,

532
00:20:50,957 --> 00:20:53,161
and please don't bring
any stress into the green zone.

533
00:20:55,236 --> 00:20:57,316
- Hey. There you are.
- Hey.

534
00:20:57,402 --> 00:20:59,503
I was just gonna
actually take a break.

535
00:20:59,589 --> 00:21:00,606
You want to go grab a coffee?

536
00:21:00,691 --> 00:21:02,543
Uh, I meant Dr. Karev.

537
00:21:02,629 --> 00:21:03,714
Oh.

538
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,827
Um, we think we know
why Nora's glucose shot up.

539
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:08,683
Qadri found this under her pillow.

540
00:21:09,035 --> 00:21:11,386
We think she may have sabotaged
the surgery.

541
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:13,702
We got to go.

542
00:21:13,941 --> 00:21:15,004
Yep.

543
00:21:22,636 --> 00:21:25,824
Why would you do this when
we've been waiting and waiting?

544
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:27,018
- Why?
- Mom, stop.

545
00:21:27,104 --> 00:21:29,518
I'm not stopping
until you tell us why you...

546
00:21:29,604 --> 00:21:31,450
Because I don't want
to go back to school!

547
00:21:35,644 --> 00:21:37,128
I hate it.

548
00:21:37,471 --> 00:21:40,761
It's all cliques and stupid
girls with stupid crushes

549
00:21:40,847 --> 00:21:43,832
and stupid boys who get mad
when I beat them at math.

550
00:21:43,941 --> 00:21:45,370
Nobody sits with me at lunch.

551
00:21:45,456 --> 00:21:47,323
- What about Lauren?
- I missed too much school

552
00:21:47,409 --> 00:21:48,534
because I'm sick all the time,

553
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:50,659
so she found other kids to sit with.

554
00:21:52,922 --> 00:21:55,237
I don't have any friends there.

555
00:21:57,268 --> 00:21:58,968
But here I do.

556
00:21:59,795 --> 00:22:01,393
So I want to stay here.

557
00:22:03,033 --> 00:22:04,519
Nora, we'll be checking your labs

558
00:22:04,605 --> 00:22:05,965
once you finish your Insulin drip.

559
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:07,635
Once your labs stabilize...

560
00:22:07,721 --> 00:22:08,989
I'll just drink more juice.

561
00:22:09,641 --> 00:22:11,236
I don't want the surgery.

562
00:22:12,448 --> 00:22:14,855
It's my body. I don't want it.

563
00:22:16,681 --> 00:22:19,330
I taught her that.
That it's her body.

564
00:22:19,455 --> 00:22:21,695
I'm not sure what to do here.

565
00:22:22,197 --> 00:22:23,603
Eileen, can we talk?

566
00:22:23,736 --> 00:22:26,244
<i>Inpatient Services, 3343.</i>

567
00:22:26,463 --> 00:22:29,205
<i>Inpatient Services, 3343.</i>

568
00:22:29,345 --> 00:22:30,556
I didn't know...

569
00:22:30,642 --> 00:22:32,470
I didn't know
she hated school.

570
00:22:32,556 --> 00:22:34,542
I didn't know she and Lauren
weren't friends anymore.

571
00:22:34,627 --> 00:22:35,931
How did I not know?

572
00:22:36,017 --> 00:22:38,050
Well, they reach an age
where they like to keep secrets,

573
00:22:38,135 --> 00:22:40,128
like to figure things out for themselves.
It's not on you.

574
00:22:40,213 --> 00:22:41,876
I called Lauren a bitch once.

575
00:22:42,001 --> 00:22:45,197
Not to her face, but behind
her back, to my daughter,

576
00:22:45,283 --> 00:22:46,963
I called her 10-year-old
best friend a bitch

577
00:22:47,048 --> 00:22:49,306
because she was being a bitch. To my kid.

578
00:22:49,392 --> 00:22:52,767
And I wanted to protect her
and be on her side,

579
00:22:52,853 --> 00:22:55,806
but maybe that's why Nora
doesn't talk to me anymore.

580
00:22:56,189 --> 00:22:59,025
Maybe I wasn't supposed
to react, just listen.

581
00:22:59,111 --> 00:23:01,587
But I'm not super great at that
historically, so...

582
00:23:01,759 --> 00:23:03,361
I'm not sure
what I'm supposed to do now.

583
00:23:03,447 --> 00:23:04,893
You're supposed
to make her get the surgery.

584
00:23:04,978 --> 00:23:06,822
- Today. Right now.
- DeLuca...

585
00:23:06,908 --> 00:23:08,213
Every kid gets bullied at school.

586
00:23:08,298 --> 00:23:10,681
Most kids hate school at some
point or another, right?

587
00:23:10,767 --> 00:23:12,400
Are you saying
I should hold her down...

588
00:23:12,486 --> 00:23:13,650
- Yes.
- No, no, look,

589
00:23:13,736 --> 00:23:14,915
this is my patient, DeLuca...

590
00:23:15,001 --> 00:23:16,212
I don't know Nora.

591
00:23:16,298 --> 00:23:18,354
I'm not attached to whether she
has friends at school or not,

592
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:20,767
but I would like to see her not die.

593
00:23:20,853 --> 00:23:22,345
She's not dying.

594
00:23:22,431 --> 00:23:23,665
Oh, my God, what are you...

595
00:23:23,751 --> 00:23:25,592
- DeLuca.
- Look, she's in pain, right?

596
00:23:25,837 --> 00:23:27,892
Every time her pancreas flares up,

597
00:23:27,978 --> 00:23:29,822
it's extremely painful for her.

598
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:31,323
She's getting this surgery
for a reason,

599
00:23:31,408 --> 00:23:32,533
so just make her get it.

600
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:33,823
Make her get the help
that she needs.

601
00:23:33,908 --> 00:23:35,069
Look, you are dismissed, Dr. DeLuca.

602
00:23:35,154 --> 00:23:36,736
Walk away now.

603
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:39,126
Walk away now, or you're fired.

604
00:23:48,259 --> 00:23:49,790
- I can't do this.
- Come on.

605
00:23:49,876 --> 00:23:51,228
I can't. It's just... It's weird.

606
00:23:51,314 --> 00:23:52,573
I don't know how to explain it.
I mean, I can...

607
00:23:52,658 --> 00:23:55,509
I can give her orders like...
like... like she's a soldier.

608
00:23:55,595 --> 00:23:56,517
Are you serious?

609
00:23:56,603 --> 00:24:00,329
What? I'm good at that.
Th-This baby-talk thing...

610
00:24:00,415 --> 00:24:02,103
it ... it just...
I don't know.

611
00:24:02,189 --> 00:24:03,369
It's not my thing.
It makes me feel...

612
00:24:03,454 --> 00:24:05,866
I don't know... shy.

613
00:24:06,056 --> 00:24:07,634
Oh, I-I'll turn around.

614
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,803
How about that?</font>

615
00:24:09,888 --> 00:24:12,657
Okay.

616
00:24:13,826 --> 00:24:15,042
Hello.

617
00:24:15,367 --> 00:24:16,605
Hi!

618
00:24:16,907 --> 00:24:18,844
<i>Guten Tag. That's German.</i>

619
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:20,731
Technically, it means "good day," but...

620
00:24:22,282 --> 00:24:23,550
I'm your mom.

621
00:24:24,149 --> 00:24:25,298
But you probably
already know that

622
00:24:25,383 --> 00:24:26,281
'cause you're floating
around inside me.

623
00:24:26,367 --> 00:24:28,150
- I'm terrible at this. I can't... I...
- You're doing great.

624
00:24:28,235 --> 00:24:29,844
No, I'm not. I'm... I'm terrible at it,

625
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:31,157
and I'm already failing as a mom.

626
00:24:31,242 --> 00:24:32,789
I'm... I'm insufficient.

627
00:24:32,875 --> 00:24:34,001
Teddy, that doesn't even make sense.

628
00:24:34,086 --> 00:24:36,063
Look, and I'm sure
I caused whatever it was

629
00:24:36,149 --> 00:24:37,236
that made her want
to come out early.

630
00:24:37,321 --> 00:24:40,008
I mean, I'm on my feet too long
and didn't drink enough water,

631
00:24:40,094 --> 00:24:42,024
or probably forgot to take
a prenatal one day.

632
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:44,227
You know, now she's gonna
be born prematurely

633
00:24:44,313 --> 00:24:46,110
with underdeveloped lungs and...

634
00:24:46,196 --> 00:24:48,781
and low birth weight and no crib

635
00:24:48,867 --> 00:24:50,196
and a... a terrified mom,

636
00:24:50,282 --> 00:24:52,080
who, despite being a surgeon...</font>

637
00:24:52,165 --> 00:24:54,930
...knows crap about...
about taking care of babies...

638
00:24:55,016 --> 00:24:56,299
What are you doing?

639
00:24:56,385 --> 00:24:57,734
I...</font>

640
00:24:58,137 --> 00:25:00,297
...am trying to show you
that you are not alone.

641
00:25:00,383 --> 00:25:02,300
Or, at least I think I am.

642
00:25:02,386 --> 00:25:04,637
- Hold on. 
- Owen. Oh.

643
00:25:06,485 --> 00:25:07,969
Owen,
you don't have to do this.

644
00:25:08,054 --> 00:25:09,844
Give me a minute.</font>

645
00:25:10,101 --> 00:25:11,804
Whew!</font>

646
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:14,975
Whew! Oh, yeah.

647
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:22,772
All right, Helm,
what are some other ways

648
00:25:22,858 --> 00:25:25,585
that we could've
prepared this vessel?

649
00:25:25,671 --> 00:25:29,421
We could've done a vein patch
or a saphenous vein graft.

650
00:25:29,507 --> 00:25:31,046
Her anasto...

651
00:25:31,225 --> 00:25:33,796
<i>T-Their</i> anastomosis looks good.

652
00:25:33,913 --> 00:25:35,874
Hm, see? That wasn't so hard, was it?

653
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:38,436
Well, yes, it was,
as a matter of fact.

654
00:25:38,663 --> 00:25:41,061
It was wholly unnatural
to my ear.

655
00:25:41,515 --> 00:25:46,015
You know, I had a mechanic
who called me Ricky

656
00:25:46,218 --> 00:25:48,850
no matter how many times
I corrected him.

657
00:25:48,936 --> 00:25:50,554
Best mechanic I ever had.

658
00:25:50,874 --> 00:25:51,874
I fired him.

659
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,116
You fired a guy 'cause
he called you Ricky?

660
00:25:54,202 --> 00:25:55,593
I'm not a Ricky.

661
00:25:55,741 --> 00:25:57,632
That's kind of a false equivalent.

662
00:25:57,780 --> 00:26:00,257
Comparing an annoying nickname
to misgendering...

663
00:26:00,343 --> 00:26:02,975
I'm just saying that
I understand what it's like

664
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:04,874
when you're called
something you aren't.

665
00:26:05,218 --> 00:26:07,562
I've been called
a lot worse than Ricky.

666
00:26:07,929 --> 00:26:10,616
It's just... just that
the world moves fast,

667
00:26:10,702 --> 00:26:13,233
and I'm... I'm trying to keep up,

668
00:26:13,319 --> 00:26:14,296
and I'm trying to adjust,

669
00:26:14,382 --> 00:26:16,834
and your attitude is not
helping the process.

670
00:26:18,015 --> 00:26:20,861
I had a girlfriend
call me Jackie once.

671
00:26:21,104 --> 00:26:22,596
Did you break up with her?

672
00:26:22,681 --> 00:26:25,370
Damn straight I did.</font>

673
00:26:25,659 --> 00:26:28,468
Dr. Karev, Nora's new
glucose panel came back.

674
00:26:28,553 --> 00:26:30,151
Ah, this is good.

675
00:26:30,237 --> 00:26:32,792
This is good. And her
potassium level is down, too.

676
00:26:33,016 --> 00:26:34,276
So we can do it?

677
00:26:34,362 --> 00:26:36,682
I think we can
if we can talk her into it.

678
00:26:36,854 --> 00:26:38,278
<i>Dr. Fisher,
call Cardio-Path Lab.</i>

679
00:26:39,468 --> 00:26:40,814
<i>Dr. Fisher, call Cardio-Path Lab.</i>

680
00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:42,011
Damn it.

681
00:26:42,178 --> 00:26:44,918
You try to help a guy out a little,
and now I gotta fire him.

682
00:26:47,066 --> 00:26:48,888
Yeah, you know,
I was about your age

683
00:26:48,974 --> 00:26:51,658
when I moved with my mom
from Italy to Wisconsin.

684
00:26:51,743 --> 00:26:53,557
And 
they hated me.

685
00:26:53,649 --> 00:26:55,128
I could barely speak any English.

686
00:26:55,214 --> 00:26:57,965
They called me "DeLoser"
for two years straight.

687
00:26:58,417 --> 00:27:00,393
It was tough, but I got through it.

688
00:27:00,652 --> 00:27:03,714
And trust me...
you are way cooler than I was.

689
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,018
Unhunh.

690
00:27:05,178 --> 00:27:07,329
And my hair... you gotta
see my hair, Nora.

691
00:27:08,597 --> 00:27:10,461
Look at this.</font>

692
00:27:11,555 --> 00:27:13,401
Hm?

693
00:27:13,487 --> 00:27:14,670
Huh?

694
00:27:14,756 --> 00:27:16,026
That's me.

695
00:27:16,244 --> 00:27:18,573
Believe me...
that kid got bullied.

696
00:27:20,358 --> 00:27:23,243
Nora, kids are mean, and
they're always gonna be mean.

697
00:27:23,792 --> 00:27:26,097
But you can kick all their asses
at math.

698
00:27:26,183 --> 00:27:28,018
That makes you
better than them.

699
00:27:28,565 --> 00:27:30,034
You're gonna find friends.

700
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,704
You already made a bunch here,
right?

701
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:34,401
I'm gonna let you in
on a little secret, too.

702
00:27:35,003 --> 00:27:36,803
We're all
a bunch of nerds here.

703
00:27:36,888 --> 00:27:38,838
And we like you a lot.

704
00:27:40,191 --> 00:27:41,708
And you're gonna find
more of us...

705
00:27:41,878 --> 00:27:43,136
I promise you.

706
00:27:43,972 --> 00:27:45,815
You just got
to push through.

707
00:27:46,844 --> 00:27:48,448
So can you trust me?

708
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,517
And push through?

709
00:27:52,679 --> 00:27:54,558
Yeah? All right.

710
00:27:55,795 --> 00:27:57,011
This jacket's hilarious.

711
00:27:57,122 --> 00:27:58,746
Hey, I still have that jacket.

712
00:28:08,518 --> 00:28:09,947
Pick-ups, please.

713
00:28:10,545 --> 00:28:13,408
You did a beautiful job
on that first laminectomy.

714
00:28:13,705 --> 00:28:16,893
Well, this one's tougher.
The vertebra is crushed.

715
00:28:17,085 --> 00:28:19,026
This is the one that...
Let me see if I can ease if off.

716
00:28:19,111 --> 00:28:21,111
Careful.
If it shifts even a little,

717
00:28:21,189 --> 00:28:22,572
she's in a wheelchair forever.

718
00:28:22,743 --> 00:28:24,640
Thanks for that.

719
00:28:24,726 --> 00:28:27,041
- No pressure.
- Well, it's what it is.

720
00:28:27,144 --> 00:28:29,221
And she's got that triathlon
with her kid.

721
00:28:29,758 --> 00:28:30,778
Good.

722
00:28:31,002 --> 00:28:33,596
Good. Good.

723
00:28:34,275 --> 00:28:35,394
Okay, stop.

724
00:28:35,541 --> 00:28:37,010
That's enough.

725
00:28:37,945 --> 00:28:39,139
That's great.

726
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:41,031
Thank you.

727
00:28:41,147 --> 00:28:43,025
Let me get that
last bone fragment.

728
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:48,664
All right, let's run
the potentials again, please?

729
00:28:49,023 --> 00:28:50,604
See if she can walk.

730
00:28:50,689 --> 00:28:51,932
Strong motor and sensory

731
00:28:52,017 --> 00:28:53,203
signals strength throughout.

732
00:28:53,288 --> 00:28:54,952
Okay, okay.

733
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:56,382
As soon as we get out of here,

734
00:28:56,468 --> 00:28:58,804
we're gonna reposition her
for the C5 repair.

735
00:29:03,277 --> 00:29:04,861
Qadri, what do you see?

736
00:29:05,132 --> 00:29:07,015
Areas of necrosis.

737
00:29:07,124 --> 00:29:11,124
But I think we can find some
healthy islet cells in there.

738
00:29:12,602 --> 00:29:14,202
Kids are mean.

739
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:16,526
I grew up in Utah.

740
00:29:16,611 --> 00:29:18,421
I was the
only non-Mormon in my school.

741
00:29:18,507 --> 00:29:20,765
They put a garter snake
in my backpack.

742
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:22,468
I was fat.

743
00:29:22,817 --> 00:29:24,334
I was <i>me.</i>

744
00:29:24,419 --> 00:29:25,568
That would be hard.

745
00:29:26,810 --> 00:29:29,414
Dr. Karev, nobody told me
you were starting.

746
00:29:29,499 --> 00:29:31,508
No one needed to.
You're not on this case.

747
00:29:33,628 --> 00:29:35,851
I'm the reason she consented
to this surgery.

748
00:29:35,937 --> 00:29:37,632
After I told you to stay away
from her.

749
00:29:37,718 --> 00:29:38,890
I meant what I said, DeLuca.

750
00:29:38,976 --> 00:29:40,710
I don't want you anywhere
near this.

751
00:29:42,298 --> 00:29:43,753
I mean it. Get out.

752
00:29:51,499 --> 00:29:53,580
- Can you get...
- This little bit right there?

753
00:29:54,649 --> 00:29:56,350
Thank you.

754
00:29:56,435 --> 00:29:57,734
I don't know how you do it.

755
00:29:57,819 --> 00:29:59,569
- Do what?
- Neuro.

756
00:29:59,751 --> 00:30:00,900
This much pressure?

757
00:30:00,986 --> 00:30:02,838
Brains and spines, life and death,

758
00:30:02,924 --> 00:30:04,647
every time you set foot
in an OR.

759
00:30:04,733 --> 00:30:05,999
I'd go crazy.

760
00:30:06,085 --> 00:30:08,952
Well, adrenaline's the only high
I let myself have anymore.

761
00:30:09,038 --> 00:30:10,530
I'm saying it's impressive.

762
00:30:12,814 --> 00:30:13,977
We're losing the signal

763
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:15,418
to both her
upper and lower extremities.

764
00:30:15,503 --> 00:30:16,569
What? Why?

765
00:30:16,655 --> 00:30:17,945
Did you Nick something
when we removed the disk?

766
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:19,923
No, I wasn't anywhere near it.
Neither were you.

767
00:30:20,008 --> 00:30:21,647
Okay, why are we losing signal
like that?

768
00:30:21,733 --> 00:30:22,813
I-Is there residual disk? Penfield 4!

769
00:30:22,898 --> 00:30:24,288
Now they're gone completely.

770
00:30:24,374 --> 00:30:25,539
Is her blood pressure dropping off?

771
00:30:25,624 --> 00:30:26,601
Is she getting her fluids?

772
00:30:26,687 --> 00:30:27,730
Her blood pressure has been stable.

773
00:30:27,815 --> 00:30:29,799
This makes no sense.
Recheck the signal, please.

774
00:30:29,884 --> 00:30:31,983
Negative.
No response in arms or legs.

775
00:30:32,069 --> 00:30:33,147
All of it? It's all gone?

776
00:30:33,233 --> 00:30:34,793
Give her 1,200
milligrams of Solu-Medrol.

777
00:30:34,878 --> 00:30:36,601
- On it!
- She lost all of it?

778
00:30:37,022 --> 00:30:38,641
Arms and legs?
All of it?

779
00:30:42,344 --> 00:30:44,047
You look like
you're about to throw up.

780
00:30:44,132 --> 00:30:45,196
Oh, I'm not.

781
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:48,086
You're
actually turning green.

782
00:30:48,171 --> 00:30:49,752
- You should get down.
- Nope.

783
00:30:50,499 --> 00:30:51,851
Gesture appreciated,

784
00:30:51,937 --> 00:30:53,538
but you don't have
to suffer with me...

785
00:30:53,624 --> 00:30:54,874
Yes, I do.

786
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,963
I'm in this with you.
And her.

787
00:30:58,085 --> 00:30:59,671
We're in this together.
We're a family.

788
00:30:59,914 --> 00:31:01,710
Every step of the way,
okay?

789
00:31:02,733 --> 00:31:04,116
I know you're scared.

790
00:31:04,352 --> 00:31:05,608
I am, too.

791
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:07,533
At least you know what to do.
You have Leo.

792
00:31:08,756 --> 00:31:10,780
Last night, I put
Leo's diaper on backwards,

793
00:31:10,866 --> 00:31:11,866
and he peed the bed.

794
00:31:11,952 --> 00:31:13,476
Poor guy had to sleep in wet sheets.

795
00:31:13,562 --> 00:31:16,412
Yeah. I mean,
we just do the best we can.

796
00:31:16,601 --> 00:31:17,851
It's all we can do.

797
00:31:21,627 --> 00:31:22,669
Hey.

798
00:31:24,495 --> 00:31:27,671
Your mom... she's better than the best.

799
00:31:28,209 --> 00:31:31,127
She's incredibly
kind and hilarious,

800
00:31:31,212 --> 00:31:32,357
and she's so strong.

801
00:31:32,442 --> 00:31:35,593
I remember...
I saw her do a thoracotomy

802
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:37,437
in a helicopter
that had no doors,

803
00:31:37,523 --> 00:31:39,296
and that patient lived,
yeah.

804
00:31:39,608 --> 00:31:40,897
Yeah.

805
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:43,780
She listens to Duran
Duran <i>way</i> too loud...

806
00:31:43,866 --> 00:31:45,976
...and she can take down
an entire pizza on her own,

807
00:31:46,062 --> 00:31:47,435
which I find insanely
charming.

808
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:52,699
She is loyal,
and she is fierce, and...

809
00:31:53,968 --> 00:31:57,710
...she would lay upside-down
for weeks if you needed her to.

810
00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:00,289
You'll never turn around

811
00:32:00,375 --> 00:32:02,327
and not have her standing
right behind you,

812
00:32:02,588 --> 00:32:04,983
holding you up, okay?

813
00:32:06,272 --> 00:32:08,473
So, little one,
you do not have to worry.

814
00:32:10,051 --> 00:32:11,734
Your mom has got this.

815
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:15,038
Owen.

816
00:32:19,979 --> 00:32:21,543
Well, this is cozy.

817
00:32:21,629 --> 00:32:23,410
Hey, hi. </font> Hi, Tom.

818
00:32:23,495 --> 00:32:24,647
Hey, Tom.

819
00:32:24,732 --> 00:32:26,995
God, is, uh, she okay?

820
00:32:27,081 --> 00:32:28,090
Are you okay?
How's the peanut?

821
00:32:28,175 --> 00:32:29,185
- She's fine. She's fine.
- Yeah?

822
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:31,821
Just, apparently, I have cervix issues,

823
00:32:31,906 --> 00:32:33,856
and hopefully
not anymore after today.

824
00:32:34,143 --> 00:32:35,628
Thanks for the update, Hunt.

825
00:32:35,843 --> 00:32:37,440
Sorry,
I-I didn't want to worry

826
00:32:37,526 --> 00:32:38,928
any more people
than I needed to.

827
00:32:39,013 --> 00:32:40,897
No,
I-I'm glad I'm here.

828
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:43,034
Listen, I'll, um,
go get a coffee

829
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,425
and check on a patient.
Do you need anything?

830
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:45,768
No, good. We're good.

831
00:32:45,853 --> 00:32:46,936
Hey, hey, give me one second, okay?</font>

832
00:32:47,021 --> 00:32:48,199
Yeah.

833
00:32:50,846 --> 00:32:51,874
So...

834
00:32:53,005 --> 00:32:54,565
I-I'm curious.

835
00:32:54,854 --> 00:32:56,746
Uh, if Teddy had been in actual labor,

836
00:32:56,987 --> 00:32:58,019
would you have told me then?

837
00:32:58,104 --> 00:33:00,204
Or would you still have let me
stay in that class?

838
00:33:00,289 --> 00:33:02,168
W... She wasn't in labor,
so what does it matter?

839
00:33:02,253 --> 00:33:04,604
Okay. Here we go.

840
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:07,574
I know you don't like me.

841
00:33:07,659 --> 00:33:09,011
Trust me, I'm not losing
sleep over it,

842
00:33:09,096 --> 00:33:10,823
but if you plan to make
a play here?

843
00:33:10,932 --> 00:33:12,550
If you're gonna show up with a ring

844
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:15,901
and take advantage of the very
old pain and vulnerability

845
00:33:15,987 --> 00:33:19,510
of a woman you have over and
over again hurt and abandoned...

846
00:33:19,596 --> 00:33:20,970
please rethink that.

847
00:33:21,354 --> 00:33:23,175
Because I will not lie down,

848
00:33:23,714 --> 00:33:25,745
and I will not walk away.

849
00:33:26,194 --> 00:33:27,698
I'll fight for her.

850
00:33:28,282 --> 00:33:30,612
And that'll bring on
a whole lot of drama and pain

851
00:33:30,698 --> 00:33:33,690
for the woman you claim
you just want to be happy.

852
00:33:33,946 --> 00:33:36,050
You don't know anything
about my history with Teddy.

853
00:33:36,151 --> 00:33:38,073
- Your history with Teddy...
- Yeah.

854
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:39,555
...is you chose Amelia.

855
00:33:39,947 --> 00:33:40,856
More than once.

856
00:33:40,958 --> 00:33:43,268
My history is, I love Teddy.

857
00:33:44,839 --> 00:33:46,346
I mean, I'm in love with her.

858
00:33:46,881 --> 00:33:48,495
And only her.

859
00:33:49,291 --> 00:33:50,901
And she deserves to be
with someone

860
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:55,004
for whom she is the first
and the only choice.

861
00:34:07,079 --> 00:34:09,068
Is she okay? Can I see her?

862
00:34:10,441 --> 00:34:11,957
She's not awake yet, Toby.

863
00:34:15,454 --> 00:34:16,712
Your mom...

864
00:34:17,786 --> 00:34:20,547
suffered an injury
to her cervical spine.

865
00:34:21,602 --> 00:34:23,836
Her cord swelled in surgery.

866
00:34:24,422 --> 00:34:26,172
We did everything that
we could,

867
00:34:26,288 --> 00:34:30,188
but she is paralyzed
from the neck down.
