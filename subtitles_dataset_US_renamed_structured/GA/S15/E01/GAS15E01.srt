00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:15,690
Wha... What are you doing here?

5
00:00:15,724 --> 00:00:18,926
Whatever you want, Dr. Grey.

6
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:23,798
Ah! Ah.

7
00:00:23,832 --> 00:00:26,934

8
00:00:28,303 --> 00:00:30,871

- What... No.

11
00:00:34,009 --> 00:00:35,009
You're with Maggie.

12
00:00:35,043 --> 00:00:37,611
Yeah, but it's just a dream,
so it doesn't count.

13
00:00:37,646 --> 00:00:39,580
No!

14
00:00:39,614 --> 00:00:41,582
Huh. Head in the gutter.

15
00:00:41,616 --> 00:00:43,384
I like it. Tell me more.

16
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:45,975
Y... You don't get to judge me.

17
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:48,222
Babe, I'm not the one judging you.

18
00:00:57,453 --> 00:00:58,466
- Mom.
- Ah!

19
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,634
Bailey woke up, and I gave him some milk,

20
00:01:00,669 --> 00:01:02,470
but he undid the cap on the sippie cup,

21
00:01:02,504 --> 00:01:05,424
and he spilled his milk all over Ellis.

22
00:01:06,041 --> 00:01:07,179
Oh, thank God.

23
00:01:13,382 --> 00:01:15,583
If I fall asleep in the sand,
will you judge me?

24
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:18,152
No. If I throw up in the sand,
will you judge me?

25
00:01:18,186 --> 00:01:19,954
Mm, only a little.

26
00:01:19,988 --> 00:01:21,756
God, it's pretty.

27
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:22,857
Pretty bright.

28
00:01:22,891 --> 00:01:24,626
Yeah.

29
00:01:24,993 --> 00:01:25,993

Uh... Uh... Hi.

00:01:58,994 --> 00:02:00,127
I'm sorry.

40
00:02:00,162 --> 00:02:02,663
I... I think I have the wrong house.

41
00:02:02,697 --> 00:02:04,342
Are you looking for Amelia or Owen?

42
00:02:04,377 --> 00:02:07,334
'Cause they're still sleeping.
The baby was up all night.

43
00:02:09,604 --> 00:02:11,281
I have the wrong house.

44
00:02:16,745 --> 00:02:18,379
What happened? Is he up again?

45
00:02:18,413 --> 00:02:20,080
No, I'm sorry. You can go back to sleep.

46
00:02:20,115 --> 00:02:21,749
It's nothing.

47
00:02:24,085 --> 00:02:25,352
Can you make coffee?

48
00:02:25,387 --> 00:02:26,630
Yeah.

49
00:02:36,598 --> 00:02:38,933
Oh, whoa. Mess.

50
00:02:38,967 --> 00:02:40,363
Not a dream.

51
00:02:40,397 --> 00:02:41,902
Definitely not a dream.

52
00:02:41,937 --> 00:02:46,340
April and Matthew
and Jo and Alex all got married.

53
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:48,409
And the rest of us got painfully drunk.

54
00:02:50,579 --> 00:02:52,680
Why do we do that?

55
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:53,881
Huh?

56
00:02:53,915 --> 00:02:57,117
Numb life's most joyous, most vulnerable,

57
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:59,587
most powerful experiences with alcohol...

58
00:02:59,621 --> 00:03:00,701
why do we do that?

59
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:03,023
Mm, that's too deep a question

60
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:05,226
for before I've had my coffee.

61
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:07,127
All yours.

62
00:03:07,162 --> 00:03:08,929
Why are we whispering?

63
00:03:08,964 --> 00:03:10,698
'Cause DeLuca's asleep.

64
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:12,066
DeLuca's not asleep.

65
00:03:13,131 --> 00:03:14,268
He's just staring like an idiot.

66
00:03:14,302 --> 00:03:15,803
He must be as hungover as I am.

67
00:03:15,837 --> 00:03:17,571
Yeah, I have to call in sick, guys.

68
00:03:17,605 --> 00:03:19,073
No. Nobody's calling in sick.

69
00:03:19,107 --> 00:03:21,108
It's a beautiful day.
You're gonna get dressed.

70
00:03:21,142 --> 00:03:22,182
We're all gonna walk to work.

71
00:03:22,216 --> 00:03:23,244
Come on.

72
00:03:23,278 --> 00:03:25,246
Let's go, guys. Come on.

73
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,248
God, my head hurts.

74
00:03:34,289 --> 00:03:36,991
Ooh. Yes. Don't mind if I do.

75
00:03:37,025 --> 00:03:39,260
Uh, orange, please.

76
00:03:39,294 --> 00:03:42,129
No, no, wait. Pineapple.

77
00:03:42,163 --> 00:03:44,465
And extra ice.

78
00:03:50,338 --> 00:03:52,940
Nice. Thank you.

79
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:01,749
Good morning.

80
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:03,150
Oh.

81
00:04:03,184 --> 00:04:04,852
Thank you, dear.

82
00:04:04,886 --> 00:04:06,854
You were up and out early.

83
00:04:06,888 --> 00:04:08,289
Did you make your AA meeting?

84
00:04:08,323 --> 00:04:10,090
Oh, no, um, I... I wanted to...

85
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:12,159
try and make a dent on these charts,

86
00:04:12,193 --> 00:04:13,367
so I... I'll go tonight.

87
00:04:13,401 --> 00:04:15,362
Did you get any sleep at all last night?

88
00:04:15,397 --> 00:04:18,032
Thanks to you...

89
00:04:18,066 --> 00:04:19,833
I slept...

90
00:04:19,868 --> 00:04:21,035
...quite...

91
00:04:21,069 --> 00:04:22,937
...well.

92
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:26,106
And I hope to sleep quite well
again tonight, too.

93
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:27,641
Uh, you get back to your charting.

94
00:04:27,676 --> 00:04:30,778
Oh, I'm too distracted now.

95
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:33,180
Mwah!

96
00:04:33,214 --> 00:04:34,915
Mm.

97
00:04:39,054 --> 00:04:42,022
Good morning, Dr. Altman!

98
00:04:42,057 --> 00:04:44,892
Oh, and what a gorgeous morning it is.

99
00:04:44,926 --> 00:04:46,126
Dr. Bailey, I have to talk to you

100
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:47,661
about the interim chief position.

101
00:04:47,696 --> 00:04:49,396
I... I just... I wanted to see you

102
00:04:49,431 --> 00:04:52,032
and... and... and...
and thank you for the offer.

103
00:04:52,067 --> 00:04:54,168
Oh, you're welcome. It's exciting.

104
00:04:54,202 --> 00:04:59,206
Oh! Plus, I just hired a new ortho god.

105
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,343
He was the personal surgeon
to the Seattle Mariners.

106
00:05:03,378 --> 00:05:07,548
And... And we are putting
the finishing touches

107
00:05:07,582 --> 00:05:11,752
on a state-of-the-art
hyperbaric therapy center.

108
00:05:11,786 --> 00:05:14,088
Oh, we are state-of-the-art.

109
00:05:14,122 --> 00:05:16,357
We are a place you want to work.

110
00:05:16,391 --> 00:05:18,325
I know. I know.

111
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,062
Th... This is not personal, Dr. Bailey.

112
00:05:22,097 --> 00:05:25,165
Just... I thought that I was
coming back to town to stay.

113
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,334
I... I thought that I wanted...
but I... I don't.

114
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:30,037
I... I... I don't want
what I thought I wanted,

115
00:05:30,071 --> 00:05:32,539
so I'm... I'm <i>not coming back to town.</i>

116
00:05:32,574 --> 00:05:34,775
I can't be your interim chief.

117
00:05:34,809 --> 00:05:36,377
I'm going.

118
00:05:36,411 --> 00:05:39,447
Far, far away.

119
00:05:39,482 --> 00:05:40,600
So, you know, just...

120
00:05:40,634 --> 00:05:43,183
Good luck with your...
the stress sabbatical, and...

121
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:45,285
I hope that I haven't added to it.

122
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,287
The... The stress.

123
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:52,926
Yeah, I mean, I was just saying
April got married, right?

124
00:05:52,961 --> 00:05:55,429
And I stood there, and I watched,

125
00:05:55,463 --> 00:05:57,231
and it was good.

126
00:05:57,265 --> 00:05:59,466
I was good. I was truly happy for her,

127
00:05:59,501 --> 00:06:01,301
and that's a big deal in my life.

128
00:06:01,336 --> 00:06:03,137
It's like a turning point, actually.

129
00:06:03,171 --> 00:06:05,739
So, I just... I don't know...
want to pay attention to that.

130
00:06:05,774 --> 00:06:07,241
To what?

131
00:06:07,275 --> 00:06:08,542
To whatever's next.

132
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:10,310
You know? I don't... I don't know.

133
00:06:10,345 --> 00:06:12,913
It's not like I believe in a big sign

134
00:06:12,947 --> 00:06:15,249
or a message from above
or something like that.

135
00:06:15,283 --> 00:06:16,985
It's just...

136
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:19,446
I don't know.

137
00:06:20,355 --> 00:06:22,089
Oh, my God.

138
00:06:22,123 --> 00:06:23,757
I kissed Meredith Grey last night.

139
00:06:23,792 --> 00:06:25,292
Oh. Oh, my God.

140
00:06:25,326 --> 00:06:26,994
I mean, I just don't get how she was able

141
00:06:27,028 --> 00:06:29,630
to make a decision that big that fast.

142
00:06:29,664 --> 00:06:31,265
I mean, it takes me
three weeks of research

143
00:06:31,299 --> 00:06:33,267
just to choose a toothbrush.

144
00:06:33,301 --> 00:06:34,835
Yeah, well, that's April for you.

145
00:06:34,869 --> 00:06:37,171
I mean, you know,
she did the same thing with me.

146
00:06:37,205 --> 00:06:38,302
Honestly, I don't know.

147
00:06:38,336 --> 00:06:40,507
I feel like maybe that's how faith works.

148
00:06:40,542 --> 00:06:42,843
Yeah, I mean, I guess that's the appeal.

149
00:06:42,877 --> 00:06:45,312
You just follow your gut...

150
00:06:45,346 --> 00:06:46,954
...and you trust that

151
00:06:46,979 --> 00:06:48,148
there's some hand there

152
00:06:48,183 --> 00:06:49,322
to catch you if you fall

153
00:06:49,356 --> 00:06:51,185
or... or to help you if you get it wrong.

154
00:06:51,219 --> 00:06:52,896
Hey. Hey!

155
00:07:08,036 --> 00:07:09,103
Whoa.

Ma'am.

159
00:07:34,811 --> 00:07:36,646
- Is anybody gonna call?
- 911. Yeah, I got it.

160
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,080
Uh, what... what do you see?

161
00:07:38,115 --> 00:07:39,115
Got a thready pulse.

162
00:07:39,149 --> 00:07:41,150
Respirations are shallow.
Obviously an open femur fracture.

163
00:07:41,184 --> 00:07:43,252
Probably has internal injuries, as well.

164
00:07:43,286 --> 00:07:44,887
Come on, pick up.

165
00:07:44,921 --> 00:07:47,055
- You saved our lives, man.
- I just grabbed your jacket.

166
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:49,425
DeLuca, my life almost ended,
and you saved it.

167
00:07:49,459 --> 00:07:52,428
All right? You were gonna
call in sick, for God's sake.

168
00:07:52,462 --> 00:07:53,996
If you'd done that, I'd be dead.

What?

No.

174
00:08:07,544 --> 00:08:09,011
Stop smirking at me.

175
00:08:09,046 --> 00:08:10,246
I don't smirk... I smile.

176
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,747
And if you interpret my smile as a smirk,

177
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:13,416
well, that's just because
you find me mischievous,

178
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:16,452
and, dare I say, charming.

179
00:08:16,486 --> 00:08:18,454
I don't find you anything.

180
00:08:18,488 --> 00:08:19,455

00:08:19,489 --> 00:08:21,490
so at the very least,
you find me talented.

182
00:08:23,527 --> 00:08:26,996
- Let's just leave it at that.
- Ah.

183
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:28,698
- Hey. Got the elevator.
- Oh. Oh.

184
00:08:28,732 --> 00:08:29,765
Oh, hey. Morning.

185
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,468
- Hey.
- Hey, Leo!

186
00:08:32,502 --> 00:08:34,003
Don't you look cute in that hat?

187
00:08:36,973 --> 00:08:38,974
Those two back in the saddle?

188
00:08:39,009 --> 00:08:40,098
Unclear.

189
00:08:40,132 --> 00:08:42,611
You think they can sense
our sexual tension?

190
00:08:42,646 --> 00:08:43,946
Wouldn't I sense it?

191
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:45,648
Oh, ouch. Delightful.

192
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:49,118
Oh, crap.

193
00:08:49,152 --> 00:08:50,352
- Teddy.
- Teddy.

194
00:08:50,387 --> 00:08:51,468
- Hi.
- Wait, why are you...

195
00:08:51,503 --> 00:08:53,556
- What are you doing here?
- Excuse me. Oh, hi.

196
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:54,557
- Hi.
- Hey.

197
00:08:54,591 --> 00:08:55,758
Bailey offered me a job,

198
00:08:55,792 --> 00:08:59,228
- and I was considering it, but...
- We have a head of cardio.

199
00:08:59,262 --> 00:09:02,398
Uh, interim chief. She... She
offered me the interim chief job.

200
00:09:02,432 --> 00:09:04,633
Oh. There's an interim
chief job? I didn't...

201
00:09:04,668 --> 00:09:07,470
Uh, she's wanting a...
a stress sabbatical.

202
00:09:07,504 --> 00:09:08,671
- Oh.
- Who's the blonde?

203
00:09:08,705 --> 00:09:09,839
Get your breath out of my ear.

204
00:09:09,873 --> 00:09:11,373
So, are you gonna take it, or...?

205
00:09:12,409 --> 00:09:13,542
I am not.

206
00:09:13,577 --> 00:09:15,845
I'm... I'm... I'm leaving, actually.

207
00:09:16,947 --> 00:09:20,583
Nice to see you, Amelia,
and, uh, whoever you are.

208
00:09:20,617 --> 00:09:22,818
Oh, this is, um, this is Leo.

209
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:24,487
Yeah.

210
00:09:24,521 --> 00:09:25,554
Goodbye, Owen.

211
00:09:25,589 --> 00:09:28,724
I'm... I'm, uh, I'm...

212
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:30,359
I'm gonna go.

213
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:32,328
Wow.

214
00:09:32,362 --> 00:09:34,230
She's in Seattle, and she doesn't call?

215
00:09:34,264 --> 00:09:36,332
That's... Wow.

216
00:09:36,366 --> 00:09:38,768
Are you still... hung up on her?

217
00:09:38,802 --> 00:09:40,102
You know what? Don't answer that.

218
00:09:40,137 --> 00:09:43,439
I am gonna drop off Leo.
You have a good day.

219
00:09:43,473 --> 00:09:44,774
Amelia...

220
00:09:46,643 --> 00:09:47,943
Hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down.

221
00:09:47,978 --> 00:09:50,613
Incoming trauma!

222
00:09:55,719 --> 00:09:56,705
- First!
- First!

223
00:09:56,739 --> 00:09:59,221
Uh, wrong. <i>I</i> was first.

224
00:09:59,256 --> 00:10:00,990
- Second!
- Easy!

225
00:10:01,024 --> 00:10:02,525
I don't want you to die out here.

226
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:03,626
Uh, what's the matter here?

227
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:06,729
Uh, he was on the floor
in the bathroom screaming.

228
00:10:06,763 --> 00:10:08,063
I think it might be a heart attack.

229
00:10:08,098 --> 00:10:09,932
It's my stomach. It's just my stomach.

230
00:10:09,966 --> 00:10:11,433
Uh, one of you get them checked in.

231
00:10:11,468 --> 00:10:12,516
- But the trauma!
- There's a trauma.

232
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:13,969
Roy, now.

233
00:10:14,004 --> 00:10:15,404
<i>Dr. Pallas to Pediatrics.</i>

234
00:10:16,573 --> 00:10:19,475
- That's not our trauma?
- Oh, just some stomach pain.

235
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:23,245
Uh, you got this, Hunt?

236
00:10:25,515 --> 00:10:26,782
First.

237
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:32,321
<i>Dr. Lee to the ER. Dr. Lee to the ER.</i>

238
00:10:32,355 --> 00:10:34,490
Ow. Ohh.

239
00:10:34,524 --> 00:10:35,958
Damn it, ow!

240
00:10:35,992 --> 00:10:37,226
Oh.

241
00:10:42,766 --> 00:10:45,501
Uh, hey, hey. Come here.

242
00:10:45,535 --> 00:10:46,769
Who's your head of cardio?

243
00:10:46,803 --> 00:10:48,798
Dr. Maggie Pierce, ma'am.

244
00:10:49,606 --> 00:10:50,673
Are you military?

245
00:10:50,707 --> 00:10:52,341
Yes, ma'am. Air Force.

246
00:10:54,611 --> 00:10:56,011
MVC. Altered at the scene.

247
00:10:56,046 --> 00:10:57,146
Pulse 130.

248
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:58,314
- BP's holding in the 90s.
- Okay.

249
00:10:58,348 --> 00:10:59,515
There's also an open femur fracture.

250
00:10:59,549 --> 00:11:00,950
- Easy.
- Got it.

251
00:11:00,984 --> 00:11:02,284
She's a human bike rack.

252
00:11:02,319 --> 00:11:04,620
Bike frame seems to be tamponading
a pretty serious thigh bleed,

253
00:11:04,654 --> 00:11:05,688
so we wanted to make sure to get her

254
00:11:05,722 --> 00:11:07,656
into a controlled environment
for the extraction.

255
00:11:07,691 --> 00:11:08,724
- Yeah.
- We're gonna need ortho.

256
00:11:08,758 --> 00:11:10,860
There's some new hotshot
ortho guy. Let's get him.

257
00:11:10,894 --> 00:11:12,161
Pierce?

258
00:11:12,195 --> 00:11:13,362
I got this.

259
00:11:13,396 --> 00:11:14,830
She lost consciousness behind the wheel.

260
00:11:14,865 --> 00:11:18,300
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry!

261
00:11:21,404 --> 00:11:23,305
What?

262
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:25,140
I hear you're looking
for an interim chief,

263
00:11:25,175 --> 00:11:27,509
and I am here to tell you
your search is over.

264
00:11:27,544 --> 00:11:30,512
I know what you're thinking...
I'm chief of neuro,

265
00:11:30,547 --> 00:11:32,281
and I have my research with Koracick,

266
00:11:32,315 --> 00:11:34,516
and a teenage addict I'm trying to
keep on the straight and narrow.

267
00:11:34,551 --> 00:11:35,551
And I have Owen.

268
00:11:35,585 --> 00:11:37,119
Well, I don't <i>have</i> Owen.

269
00:11:37,153 --> 00:11:38,621
Owen has Leo, and I have Betty,

270
00:11:38,655 --> 00:11:41,690
and we most certainly
don't have each other.

271
00:11:41,725 --> 00:11:44,843
So, there are questions. And feelings.

272
00:11:44,878 --> 00:11:45,928
And the two of us together

273
00:11:45,962 --> 00:11:48,163
is like one, big, swirling
confusion tornado

274
00:11:48,198 --> 00:11:50,065
that could upend four lives, so, yeah.

275
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,468
Yeah, my life is
a bit of a mess at the moment.

276
00:11:52,502 --> 00:11:55,037
And this is the reason
why I <i>should</i> pick you?

277
00:11:55,071 --> 00:11:56,548
Because everyone knows

278
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:59,708
that people with the most disastrous
lives are brilliant at work.

279
00:11:59,743 --> 00:12:01,510
Also, I am incredibly bossy by nature.

280
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,247
Okay, seriously,

281
00:12:05,282 --> 00:12:06,882
what does Teddy Altman have that I don't?

282
00:12:08,852 --> 00:12:10,085
- Ciao.
- Hey.

283
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:13,656
Uh, you look like a... <i>come</i>...
a... a sea... a sea rat.

284
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:15,758
Oh, wow. Sleeping alone really
brings out your friendly side.

285
00:12:15,792 --> 00:12:18,827
I'm saying it must be
a pretty bad hang-under.

286
00:12:18,862 --> 00:12:20,529
<i>Hangover, and, yeah, it was.</i>

287
00:12:20,563 --> 00:12:21,864
But you know what?
I'm not feeling it anymore

288
00:12:21,898 --> 00:12:23,599
because I just saved Pierce and Avery

289
00:12:23,633 --> 00:12:25,434
from being splattered across Pine Street.

290
00:12:25,468 --> 00:12:26,479
You what?

291
00:12:26,513 --> 00:12:28,837
I'm a lifesaver, Carina.
I saved their lives.

292
00:12:28,872 --> 00:12:31,240
It's like I was God's personal
right-hand man or something.

293
00:12:31,274 --> 00:12:32,775
Okay, you seem pretty proud of that.

294
00:12:32,809 --> 00:12:35,196
Yeah. You're saying it
like it's a bad thing.

295
00:12:36,146 --> 00:12:37,680
- You paged me, Dr. Webber?
- You paged me, Dr. Webber?

296
00:12:38,648 --> 00:12:39,882
You didn't say which DeLuca.

297
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:41,517
I meant Carina,

298
00:12:41,551 --> 00:12:43,118
but her brother may as well
enjoy this, too.

299
00:12:43,153 --> 00:12:44,620
I just came in with a major
trauma, Dr. Webber, so...

300
00:12:44,654 --> 00:12:47,256
You'll want to see this, DeLuca. Roy?

301
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:49,358
Male, 42, severe abdominal pain.

302
00:12:49,392 --> 00:12:50,459
He didn't allude to why,

303
00:12:50,493 --> 00:12:52,728
but we think it may have
something to do with this.

304
00:12:54,831 --> 00:12:56,765
- Oh.
- Oh.

305
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,768
Are we taking bets on what this is?

306
00:12:59,803 --> 00:13:02,738
- I'm going with a candle.
- My money's on a shampoo bottle.

307
00:13:03,807 --> 00:13:05,226
Flashlight.

308
00:13:05,487 --> 00:13:06,976
You know, that one's strangely popular.

309
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:08,711
- Mm-hmm.
- DeLuca?

310
00:13:08,745 --> 00:13:10,112
Why would anybody
want to do this to himself?

311
00:13:10,146 --> 00:13:12,247
Because they're afraid to ask their wives

312
00:13:12,282 --> 00:13:13,882
to touch them inside there.

313
00:13:13,917 --> 00:13:16,318
They think their wives will
think they're homosexuals.

314
00:13:16,353 --> 00:13:17,553
This does seem that way to me.

315
00:13:17,587 --> 00:13:20,990
Don't be stupid. Gay men know
how to use proper sex toys

316
00:13:21,024 --> 00:13:22,825
that don't get lost up there.

317
00:13:22,859 --> 00:13:25,627
No. No, t-this is straight-man stupidity.

318
00:13:25,662 --> 00:13:29,131
The pleasure center resides
just inside the anal canal

319
00:13:29,165 --> 00:13:30,425
for all men, gay or straight.

320
00:13:30,459 --> 00:13:31,467
All right, then.

321
00:13:31,501 --> 00:13:32,801
Wait, wait, wait. I want to hear this.

322
00:13:32,836 --> 00:13:34,903
The prostate is the male G-spot.

323
00:13:34,938 --> 00:13:36,438
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

324
00:13:36,473 --> 00:13:37,840
Why do you think
we're always pulling stuff

325
00:13:37,874 --> 00:13:39,375
out of men's butts?

326
00:13:41,044 --> 00:13:42,611
Why, indeed.

327
00:13:43,179 --> 00:13:44,680
<i>Dr. Graham...</i>

328
00:13:44,714 --> 00:13:45,681
Dr. Pierce, a word?

329
00:13:45,715 --> 00:13:46,749
Yeah?

330
00:13:46,783 --> 00:13:48,603
A private word?

331
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:55,234
Okay.

332
00:13:56,026 --> 00:13:57,115
Um...

333
00:13:57,149 --> 00:13:59,428
Cece, I'll be right back.

334
00:13:59,462 --> 00:14:00,549
I'm gonna let her finish your EKG.

335
00:14:00,584 --> 00:14:01,497
You sit tight.

336
00:14:01,531 --> 00:14:02,798
- Thank you.
- Okay.

337
00:14:02,832 --> 00:14:04,366
<i>Dr. Rainey to Peds ICU.</i>

338
00:14:04,401 --> 00:14:06,835
<i>Dr. Rainey to Peds ICU.</i>

339
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:09,104
- My trauma room ready yet?
- Somebody page Ortho again.

340
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:10,839
I'm gonna need a portable scan.

341
00:14:10,874 --> 00:14:12,841
Did I die? Am I dead?

342
00:14:12,876 --> 00:14:14,810
Nisha, you are very much alive, okay?

343
00:14:14,844 --> 00:14:16,311
But I'm in Heaven.

344
00:14:16,346 --> 00:14:19,882
I never believed in Heaven
before, but here I am.

345
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:20,482
In Heaven.

346
00:14:20,517 --> 00:14:21,984
Nisha, this isn't Heaven.

347
00:14:22,018 --> 00:14:24,453
I don't think.

348
00:14:24,487 --> 00:14:27,389
I guess... I guess I don't
really know, actually.

349
00:14:27,424 --> 00:14:29,491
You know, I mean, there are
so many things we don't know.

350
00:14:29,526 --> 00:14:32,795
But you are both so pretty.

351
00:14:32,829 --> 00:14:35,964
Like angels in yellow.

352
00:14:35,999 --> 00:14:37,399
How is she? Is she gonna be all right?

353
00:14:37,434 --> 00:14:39,201
Ma'am, I'm gonna need you back in a bed.

354
00:14:39,235 --> 00:14:41,403
Oh, I'm fine. I need to know how she is.

355
00:14:41,438 --> 00:14:42,485
Are her parents coming?

356
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:44,139
They're far, far away.

357
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:45,641
I am so sorry, love.

358
00:14:45,675 --> 00:14:47,810
My mom calls me "love."

359
00:14:47,844 --> 00:14:49,578
But I've never been in love.

360
00:14:49,612 --> 00:14:52,481
I didn't want to die
before being in love,

361
00:14:52,515 --> 00:14:56,151
but I guess I had to die to find love.

362
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:57,853
In Heaven.

363
00:14:57,887 --> 00:14:59,688
Child, are you kidding me?

364
00:14:59,722 --> 00:15:02,324
I'm a matchmaker. That's what I do.

365
00:15:02,358 --> 00:15:04,726
And not by hobby... by trade.

366
00:15:04,761 --> 00:15:06,662
You just stay alive,

367
00:15:06,696 --> 00:15:09,731
and I will dedicate my life
to finding love for you.

368
00:15:09,766 --> 00:15:10,866
Excuse me, ma'am, seriously,

369
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:13,102
we need you back in your bed
while we review your EKG.

370
00:15:13,136 --> 00:15:14,603
I've had two heart transplants.

371
00:15:14,637 --> 00:15:16,338
If I drop dead right here,

372
00:15:16,372 --> 00:15:17,840
I would've already had a longer life

373
00:15:17,874 --> 00:15:20,138
than I probably should've.
So, thank you, Doctor,

374
00:15:20,172 --> 00:15:21,743
but I am not leaving this girl alone.

375
00:15:21,778 --> 00:15:23,879
Okay, ma'am, we have
an ortho team coming in,

376
00:15:23,913 --> 00:15:25,914
so we're gonna have to move you
to make room for...

377
00:15:25,949 --> 00:15:28,884
Oh, my God.

378
00:15:41,931 --> 00:15:43,799
Someone ask for an Ortho God?

379
00:15:46,069 --> 00:15:48,403
It <i>is</i> Heaven!

380
00:15:53,081 --> 00:15:55,063
She's got a nasty
open-femur fracture for sure,

381
00:15:55,088 --> 00:15:56,908
but I do not want
to take it off the metal.

382
00:15:56,942 --> 00:15:58,348
Tourniquet to control the bleeding

383
00:15:58,375 --> 00:15:59,772
before we take the metal bars off, right?

384
00:15:59,807 --> 00:16:01,310
Bingo. How you feeling, Nisha?

385
00:16:01,345 --> 00:16:03,446
Oh, God, see?

386
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:07,826
No one's ever asked me that,
like really asked me.

387
00:16:07,851 --> 00:16:10,185
Is that what it's like being in love,

388
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,887
like, in <i>love,</i> love?

389
00:16:11,921 --> 00:16:13,389
Like, where I'd wake up next to you

390
00:16:13,423 --> 00:16:15,491
and you'd ask me, "How did you sleep?"

391
00:16:15,525 --> 00:16:17,993
And that's... that's crazy. Who cares?

392
00:16:18,027 --> 00:16:18,927
I mean, I do it every night,

393
00:16:18,962 --> 00:16:21,830
but you actually
want to know how it went.

394
00:16:21,865 --> 00:16:24,366
You want to know,
"How I'm feeling, Nisha."

395
00:16:24,401 --> 00:16:25,834
I do want to know that.

396
00:16:25,869 --> 00:16:27,665
All right, I think she's
feeling all right.

397
00:16:27,699 --> 00:16:30,067
- Mm.
- I am feeling everything right now.

398
00:16:30,102 --> 00:16:31,206
Pain?

399
00:16:31,241 --> 00:16:33,041
Everything but that.

400
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:34,676
All right, we're gonna
take this step by step.

401
00:16:34,711 --> 00:16:37,045
Forks, stem, headset, cut the top tube...

402
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,313
I don't follow that.

403
00:16:38,348 --> 00:16:40,883
Oh. You didn't work in a bike shop, bud.

404
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:42,518
Four years, Venice Beach.

405
00:16:42,552 --> 00:16:43,919
Can I get a socket wrench?

406
00:16:43,953 --> 00:16:45,087
Okay, I'm gonna need these
carpenters out of there

407
00:16:45,121 --> 00:16:46,655
so I can ultrasound the belly.

408
00:16:46,689 --> 00:16:48,157
No, you're right. Let's pick up
the pace, guys, all right?

409
00:16:48,191 --> 00:16:49,057
Okay, this could have been me,

410
00:16:49,092 --> 00:16:51,427
so I'd really like it if she... lived.

411
00:16:51,461 --> 00:16:53,695
Slow and steady wins the race.

412
00:16:53,729 --> 00:16:54,763
Bud.

413
00:16:54,798 --> 00:16:56,231
All right, I'm gonna twist this, Nisha,

414
00:16:56,266 --> 00:16:57,900
and you're gonna feel
some pressure, okay?

415
00:16:57,934 --> 00:17:00,491
But if it starts to hurt,
you tell me, okay?

416
00:17:00,525 --> 00:17:02,004
I love you.

417
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:04,632
I love all of you.

418
00:17:05,275 --> 00:17:08,076
I love all of you the most.

419
00:17:11,047 --> 00:17:13,515
Okay.

420
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:15,059
Dr. Altman?

421
00:17:15,595 --> 00:17:17,019
You're Dr. Pierce?

422
00:17:17,053 --> 00:17:18,540
Head of cardio?

423
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:19,654
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

424
00:17:19,722 --> 00:17:21,109
What are you... 19?

425
00:17:21,143 --> 00:17:24,760
No, I was 19 when I graduated
from medical school,

426
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:27,296
but I was 27 when they made me
head of cardio.

427
00:17:28,665 --> 00:17:30,132
Are we both sharing our ages, or just me?

428
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:31,633
Damn it.

429
00:17:31,668 --> 00:17:33,769
You're Grey's sister, aren't you?

430
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:36,572
Why should that matter?

431
00:17:36,606 --> 00:17:37,973
All right.

432
00:17:38,007 --> 00:17:39,641
What I'm about to tell you,

433
00:17:39,676 --> 00:17:42,778
it falls under the category of
doctor-patient confidentiality.

434
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:43,779
Are we clear?

435
00:17:43,813 --> 00:17:46,248
Uh, yeah. Yeah, I'm clear
on how the job works.

436
00:17:46,282 --> 00:17:48,116
Okay.

437
00:17:50,854 --> 00:17:53,455
Dr. Pierce, I'm 11 weeks pregnant.

438
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:54,990
Yesterday, I flew 12 hours,

439
00:17:55,024 --> 00:17:57,826
and then participated
in an eight-hour surgery,

440
00:17:57,861 --> 00:17:59,228
then slept for only three hours.

441
00:17:59,262 --> 00:18:01,129
Now I'm 95% sure

442
00:18:01,164 --> 00:18:03,799
that I've got a blood clot
in my femoral vein,

443
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:06,101
so I'm afraid I could throw
a pulmonary embolism.

444
00:18:06,135 --> 00:18:08,070
So, I'm hoping...

445
00:18:08,104 --> 00:18:10,472
I'm hoping that you can
confirm my diagnosis,

446
00:18:10,507 --> 00:18:11,840
write me a prescription for Heparin

447
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:13,976
so that I can get back on a plane

448
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:16,645
and get out of here
without anyone else knowing.

449
00:18:17,814 --> 00:18:18,913
Can you help me?

450
00:18:18,948 --> 00:18:19,982
Uh...

451
00:18:24,053 --> 00:18:25,187
Check on my patient in the pit.

452
00:18:25,221 --> 00:18:27,823
If her EKG is normal,
hand her off to Dr. Grey.

453
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:29,258
Okay.

454
00:18:29,292 --> 00:18:31,293
Hey, did you read that article

455
00:18:31,327 --> 00:18:34,096
on how they're introducing
antigens on cancer cells

456
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:35,864
to make the body attack them?

457
00:18:35,899 --> 00:18:38,367
Uh, no, I was reading <i>Wrestler's Week.</i>

458
00:18:38,401 --> 00:18:40,769
Mm. It got me thinking.

459
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:43,205
About?

460
00:18:43,239 --> 00:18:44,840
Just about how much

461
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:47,009
I liked working on mini-livers
with Meredith.

462
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:48,510
It just felt new.

463
00:18:48,545 --> 00:18:51,813
Boston doesn't feel new... it feels old.

464
00:18:51,848 --> 00:18:53,315
It's normal to have doubts.

465
00:18:53,349 --> 00:18:54,516
I have doubts.

466
00:18:54,551 --> 00:18:57,286
I don't want to be freezing
all the time with no friends.

467
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,288
But if I'm with you, I'm good.

468
00:18:59,322 --> 00:19:01,990
You don't think it's a mistake
to leave Seattle?

469
00:19:02,025 --> 00:19:03,091
No, the only mistake

470
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:06,253
is talking about work on our honeymoon.

471
00:19:07,096 --> 00:19:08,463
Enjoy your sand castles

472
00:19:08,498 --> 00:19:10,399
'cause they're gonna be
snow castles soon.

473
00:19:10,433 --> 00:19:12,067
That is not a thing.

474
00:19:12,101 --> 00:19:14,703
There are snow angels and snow men.

475
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:17,005
Snow castles is not a thing.

476
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,225
Well, if it's not a thing, it should be.

477
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:24,146
You know, I wouldn't mind
our kids growing up in Boston.

478
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:26,282
I think kids should grow up
where it snows.

479
00:19:26,317 --> 00:19:27,349
You got sledding.

480
00:19:27,383 --> 00:19:30,152
You got snowball fights, you know?

481
00:19:30,186 --> 00:19:32,988
If we have two kids, then we
each get one on our own team.

482
00:19:33,022 --> 00:19:35,724
If it's not a thing, it should be.

483
00:19:35,758 --> 00:19:38,202
I mean, three's okay, too.
The more the merrier, right?

484
00:19:39,596 --> 00:19:41,663
You know, I-I just...

485
00:19:41,698 --> 00:19:42,998
I'm sorry.

486
00:19:46,803 --> 00:19:48,462
All right, then.

487
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,741
It's a major obstruction,

488
00:19:52,775 --> 00:19:55,010
and it's dangerous... we know that.

489
00:19:55,044 --> 00:19:57,579
You're gonna need surgery
for us to remove that,

490
00:19:57,614 --> 00:19:59,548
whatever it is.

491
00:19:59,582 --> 00:20:01,083
Great. Do it. I consent.

492
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:02,684
Okay, with that said,

493
00:20:02,719 --> 00:20:05,146
if you had any idea what it could be,

494
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:06,288
you should tell us.

495
00:20:06,322 --> 00:20:08,399
It's a growth.

496
00:20:09,092 --> 00:20:11,259
Must have grown there.

497
00:20:11,294 --> 00:20:12,335
It's a growth.

498
00:20:12,369 --> 00:20:14,823
So, cut me open and take out the growth.

499
00:20:14,858 --> 00:20:18,967
Roy, let's prep him for E.U.A.
and possible ex lap.

500
00:20:19,002 --> 00:20:20,402
<i>Dr. Warner, dial the operator.</i>

501
00:20:20,436 --> 00:20:23,772
<i>Dr. Warner, dial the operator.</i>

502
00:20:26,342 --> 00:20:27,309
Hey, what you got?

503
00:20:27,343 --> 00:20:29,711
I have some free time,
want to have some fun.

504
00:20:29,746 --> 00:20:32,814
I got an unknown foreign body
in the rectum.

505
00:20:32,849 --> 00:20:34,716
How unknown and how big?

506
00:20:34,751 --> 00:20:36,284
Very unknown...

507
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:37,486
and very big.

508
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,322
That sounds like fun.

509
00:20:40,356 --> 00:20:41,757
I can give it to you

510
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:44,126
<i>if</i> you make me interim chief.

511
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,594
Int... What?

512
00:20:45,628 --> 00:20:46,928
Did Teddy post a flier?

513
00:20:46,963 --> 00:20:47,963
She didn't have to.

514
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:49,965
I know everything.

515
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:52,634
Which is why I was able
to teach you everything.

516
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:54,503
You know, and I could use
a change of pace.

517
00:20:54,537 --> 00:20:56,605
You know, something
I could sink my teeth into.

518
00:20:56,639 --> 00:20:59,508
And I need the office, of course.

519
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:03,011
- Where are you going?
- It's not fun anymore.

520
00:21:03,046 --> 00:21:03,979
Wait... Wait... Wait a minute.

521
00:21:04,013 --> 00:21:06,014
Hold on.

522
00:21:06,049 --> 00:21:07,215
You want to slow down there, cowboy?

523
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:10,118
Bailey's an idiot if she doesn't
pick me to be interim chief.

524
00:21:10,153 --> 00:21:12,988
I am brilliant. I am capable.

525
00:21:13,022 --> 00:21:14,589
I'm hot.

526
00:21:14,624 --> 00:21:16,324
I am first-choice material.

527
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:18,135
For interim chief...?

528
00:21:18,608 --> 00:21:19,728
Yes, for interim chief.

529
00:21:19,762 --> 00:21:23,165
Hmm. Who was the, uh,
blonde this morning?

530
00:21:25,168 --> 00:21:27,202
She is the woman
that my ex-husband kissed

531
00:21:27,236 --> 00:21:28,704
before he was my ex-husband,

532
00:21:28,738 --> 00:21:30,105
and I think he is still hung up on her,

533
00:21:30,139 --> 00:21:32,541
and Bailey offered her
interim chief, which is...

534
00:21:32,575 --> 00:21:34,676
- Pathetic.
- Agreed.

535
00:21:34,711 --> 00:21:37,112
She has plenty
of perfectly viable candidates

536
00:21:37,146 --> 00:21:39,214
- for that job right here...
- No, no, this display is pathetic.

537
00:21:39,248 --> 00:21:40,315
This alternate reality

538
00:21:40,349 --> 00:21:41,983
where you were some kind of
a victim in your marriage.

539
00:21:42,018 --> 00:21:43,285
You're a lot of things, Amelia Shepherd,

540
00:21:43,319 --> 00:21:44,653
but a victim is not one of the them.

541
00:21:44,687 --> 00:21:46,009
An ass, yes.

542
00:21:46,043 --> 00:21:47,055
Excuse me?

543
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:48,323
You were a giant ass to your husband.

544
00:21:48,357 --> 00:21:49,348
You treated him terribly.

545
00:21:49,383 --> 00:21:51,059
When I came to cut into your brain,

546
00:21:51,094 --> 00:21:52,260
I didn't realize you were even married.

547
00:21:52,295 --> 00:21:54,830
- That's how little you seemed to care.
- I had a tumor.

548
00:21:54,864 --> 00:21:57,199
You and I had sex
the day after you separated.

549
00:21:57,233 --> 00:21:59,468
It was dirty, filthy, hot sex.

550
00:21:59,502 --> 00:22:00,502
I was excellent.

551
00:22:00,536 --> 00:22:02,170
But it was not tumor sex.
The tumor was gone.

552
00:22:02,205 --> 00:22:03,171
It was gratitude sex.

553
00:22:03,206 --> 00:22:05,307
It was "thanks so much
for not killing me" sex.

554
00:22:05,341 --> 00:22:07,976
It was "thank God I'm not married
to that ginger anymore" sex,

555
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:09,144
and you know it.

556
00:22:10,279 --> 00:22:12,214
Oh.

557
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:16,918
So, you have had two
transplants, Ms. Colvin?

558
00:22:16,953 --> 00:22:18,487
You can call me Cece, please.

559
00:22:18,521 --> 00:22:20,088
And, yes, I have had two

560
00:22:20,123 --> 00:22:21,890
and am probably due for my third.

561
00:22:21,924 --> 00:22:23,558
Your EKG looks perfectly normal,

562
00:22:23,593 --> 00:22:25,360
but something did cause you
to pass out at the wheel,

563
00:22:25,394 --> 00:22:27,929
so I would like to run
more tests, if that's okay.

564
00:22:27,964 --> 00:22:30,198
Dr. Parker, get a prograf and a CMP

565
00:22:30,233 --> 00:22:32,100
- and keep Dr. Pierce updated.
- Yes, ma'am.

566
00:22:32,135 --> 00:22:33,435
Uh, Dr. Parker?

567
00:22:33,469 --> 00:22:35,003
I know it's a military thing,
but, you know,

568
00:22:35,037 --> 00:22:36,138
when you call me ma'am,

569
00:22:36,172 --> 00:22:38,240
it really does make me feel like
I'm a hundred years old.

570
00:22:38,274 --> 00:22:40,442
Yes, ma'am. Uh, sorry, ma'am.
Sorry, Doctor.

571
00:22:40,476 --> 00:22:42,010
Just go.

572
00:22:42,044 --> 00:22:43,929
Dr. Grey?

573
00:22:44,323 --> 00:22:45,380
- Ah.
- Hi.

574
00:22:45,414 --> 00:22:47,449
Uh, I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

575
00:22:47,483 --> 00:22:49,251
I never should have kissed you like that.

576
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,020
I mean, you're incredible.

577
00:22:52,054 --> 00:22:53,455
- It's fine.
- I-It's not fine.

578
00:22:53,489 --> 00:22:56,625
I respect so much as a surgeon,
and I just... I would nev...

579
00:22:56,659 --> 00:22:59,194
I would never do that to you
under normal circumstances.

580
00:22:59,228 --> 00:23:01,675
But you were just very, very
kind to me, and I was drunk,

581
00:23:01,709 --> 00:23:03,098
and the dress was, I mean...

582
00:23:03,132 --> 00:23:04,533
Anyway, it never should've happened,

583
00:23:04,567 --> 00:23:07,469
and it never will happen again.

584
00:23:07,503 --> 00:23:08,937
I'm gonna go now.

585
00:23:10,239 --> 00:23:12,207
Well, that's a shame.

586
00:23:12,241 --> 00:23:13,278
You like him?

587
00:23:13,312 --> 00:23:15,310
I'm his teacher.

588
00:23:15,344 --> 00:23:16,912
You don't want to kiss him again?

589
00:23:16,946 --> 00:23:19,447
- He's my student.
- Well, all right.

590
00:23:19,482 --> 00:23:22,717
But you want <i>somebody to kiss you.</i>

591
00:23:22,752 --> 00:23:23,952
I can tell.

592
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:26,154
It's my superpower.

593
00:23:26,189 --> 00:23:27,389
You can talk to me... I'm safe.

594
00:23:27,423 --> 00:23:30,225
I'm like the opposite of a priest.

595
00:23:30,259 --> 00:23:33,295
People confess things to me,
but I don't make them feel bad.

596
00:23:33,329 --> 00:23:34,691
Well, I don't need anyone...

597
00:23:34,726 --> 00:23:36,231
It's not about need, honey.

598
00:23:36,265 --> 00:23:38,266
It's about desire.

599
00:23:38,301 --> 00:23:40,302
And you are not a hundred years old.

600
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:42,926
You are beautiful and vibrant.

601
00:23:42,961 --> 00:23:44,005
Oh, excuse me.

602
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,141
Dr. Bailey, do you have a moment?

603
00:23:46,175 --> 00:23:47,642
Mm. What do you have, Grey?

604
00:23:47,677 --> 00:23:49,778
I have a desire...

605
00:23:49,812 --> 00:23:50,925
to be interim chief.

606
00:23:50,959 --> 00:23:52,914
Oh, for the love of...
Specifically right now.

607
00:23:52,949 --> 00:23:55,626
I need it. I really... I need it.

608
00:23:58,287 --> 00:24:00,297
I'm having dreams.

609
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:02,490
Inappropriate.

610
00:24:02,525 --> 00:24:06,695
To a degree that I'm having
difficulty putting into words.

611
00:24:06,729 --> 00:24:08,972
I could use the extra work.

612
00:24:12,335 --> 00:24:15,203
You do have a clot,
but your D-dimer's negative.

613
00:24:15,238 --> 00:24:17,372
I want to admit you
and monitor you for a few days.

614
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:21,176
- Dr. Pierce?
- Yes.

615
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:23,812
This is so not me.

616
00:24:23,846 --> 00:24:25,347
I don't cry.

617
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:27,658
The hormones are in control now.

618
00:24:28,351 --> 00:24:30,619
And I don't get pregnant by accident.

619
00:24:30,653 --> 00:24:32,204
I'm careful!

620
00:24:33,222 --> 00:24:35,190
But a man I loved came to Germany,

621
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:37,158
and it was so hard to resist,

622
00:24:37,193 --> 00:24:39,027
and I wasn't careful.

623
00:24:39,061 --> 00:24:41,529
Oh, my God. Owen went to Germany.

624
00:24:41,564 --> 00:24:43,531
Who's Owen?

625
00:24:48,537 --> 00:24:51,306
What exactly is your
relationship to Owen?

626
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:53,308
He's kind of living with my sister.

627
00:24:55,244 --> 00:24:56,645
Your sister?

628
00:24:56,679 --> 00:24:58,188
Amelia Shepherd.

629
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:14,537
I'm sorry I talked about kids
on our honeymoon.

630
00:25:14,572 --> 00:25:16,806
It was stupid. It was just...

631
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:19,209
you were talking about
the future and snow stuff,

632
00:25:19,243 --> 00:25:21,644
and it just popped into my head.

633
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:25,466
Like, I could see our kids
playing in the snow, having fun,

634
00:25:25,507 --> 00:25:26,487
which is...

635
00:25:26,521 --> 00:25:29,423
You know, kids, snow. It makes sense.

636
00:25:29,457 --> 00:25:30,825
Alex, shut up, please.

637
00:25:30,859 --> 00:25:33,294
I-I have an idea, a big idea,
and I love you,

638
00:25:33,328 --> 00:25:34,628
and I will love all of our children,

639
00:25:34,663 --> 00:25:36,063
or at least one child eventually.

640
00:25:36,097 --> 00:25:37,798
But for now, just...

641
00:25:37,833 --> 00:25:39,217
Shh!

642
00:25:39,251 --> 00:25:40,434
I had an idea.

643
00:25:40,468 --> 00:25:41,535
What idea?

644
00:25:42,971 --> 00:25:44,638
On the house.

645
00:25:49,778 --> 00:25:53,581
The desire for a prostate
massage is absolutely normal,

646
00:25:53,615 --> 00:25:56,317
and if you have a simple
conversation with your wife

647
00:25:56,351 --> 00:25:59,253
- and explain to her your desire...
- Please stop.

648
00:25:59,287 --> 00:26:02,423
All she needs is a manicure
and a little bit of...

649
00:26:02,457 --> 00:26:03,757
Ugh, can you please make her stop?

650
00:26:03,792 --> 00:26:06,256
Not until you tell me
what you put in there.

651
00:26:06,972 --> 00:26:08,162
My wife's...

652
00:26:08,196 --> 00:26:09,468
Ow!

653
00:26:10,398 --> 00:26:11,699
...hair stuff.

654
00:26:11,733 --> 00:26:13,667
Shampoo! Yes!

655
00:26:13,702 --> 00:26:16,237
- Thank you, Dr. DeLuca.
- Any time.

656
00:26:17,739 --> 00:26:20,374
I think I'm in love with your sister.

657
00:26:22,143 --> 00:26:23,058
So, wait.

658
00:26:23,092 --> 00:26:25,012
If Meredith is your half-sister...

659
00:26:25,046 --> 00:26:26,154
Who you just met...

660
00:26:26,188 --> 00:26:28,616
...and Amelia is
Meredith's sister-in-law...

661
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:29,550
...from her dead husband...

662
00:26:29,584 --> 00:26:31,819
...then you aren't
actually really sisters.

663
00:26:31,853 --> 00:26:33,220
Yeah, I know, but it's...

664
00:26:33,255 --> 00:26:34,855
it's more like metaphorical sisters.

665
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:36,624
Like, we're all sisters.

666
00:26:36,658 --> 00:26:39,059
There's a sister house. It's a thing.

667
00:26:39,094 --> 00:26:41,028
But you aren't <i>really</i> sisters.

668
00:26:41,062 --> 00:26:42,196
Does that matter?

669
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:44,865
Well, yeah, kind of.

670
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:45,911
I mean, blood, water.

671
00:26:45,945 --> 00:26:47,368
Oh, I don't believe in that stuff.

672
00:26:47,402 --> 00:26:49,036
But you do believe in HIPAA.

673
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:51,472
I'm not going to tell her.

674
00:26:55,277 --> 00:26:56,744
I heard nothing, Major Altman.

675
00:26:56,778 --> 00:26:59,280
Thank you, Lieutenant. Dismissed.

676
00:27:01,381 --> 00:27:02,449
Okay.

677
00:27:02,484 --> 00:27:04,518
You're leaving against medical advice.

678
00:27:04,552 --> 00:27:06,320
I've got my compression socks,

679
00:27:06,354 --> 00:27:08,923
and I will elevate my leg somewhere else.

680
00:27:08,957 --> 00:27:11,825
You can't travel.
You certainly can't fly.

681
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:13,448
I'm clear on that.

682
00:27:14,195 --> 00:27:15,829
Dr. Altman? Teddy?

683
00:27:15,864 --> 00:27:16,830
Can I call you Teddy

684
00:27:16,865 --> 00:27:19,066
now that I'm carrying
your life-altering secret?

685
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,167
No.

686
00:27:22,237 --> 00:27:23,959
Dr. Pierce...

687
00:27:25,106 --> 00:27:27,241
Thank you for the consult.

688
00:27:29,911 --> 00:27:32,880
She is right, honey...
that's not your sister.

689
00:27:34,449 --> 00:27:37,785
So, my broken-down heart
is costing me my kidneys now?

690
00:27:37,819 --> 00:27:39,288
It's not your heart.

691
00:27:39,323 --> 00:27:41,555
It's the anti-rejection meds
you take for your heart.

692
00:27:41,589 --> 00:27:43,057
They had a toxic effect on your kidneys.

693
00:27:43,091 --> 00:27:44,959
So I need a kidney transplant.

694
00:27:44,993 --> 00:27:48,729
We've already called UNOS,
but until they can find you one,

695
00:27:48,763 --> 00:27:50,931
you're gonna need peritoneal dialysis

696
00:27:50,966 --> 00:27:52,866
every night for 12 hours.

697
00:27:52,901 --> 00:27:54,902
I'll do a small surgery
and insert a catheter

698
00:27:54,936 --> 00:27:56,818
to make that possible, okay?

699
00:27:56,852 --> 00:27:59,773
Can you put me in a recovery
room beside Nisha,

700
00:27:59,808 --> 00:28:01,108
the girl I hurt?

701
00:28:01,142 --> 00:28:03,043
I-I want to be with her
till her parents arrive.

702
00:28:03,078 --> 00:28:04,645
Well, I can certainly check.

703
00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:07,381
Then I consent to the surgery.

704
00:28:07,415 --> 00:28:09,283
Now let's talk about you.

705
00:28:09,317 --> 00:28:10,818
You've been single for how long now?

706
00:28:10,852 --> 00:28:12,753
Cece.

707
00:28:12,787 --> 00:28:14,822
I am happy just as I am.

708
00:28:14,856 --> 00:28:15,998
Well, of course you are.

709
00:28:16,032 --> 00:28:17,124
How could you not be...

710
00:28:17,158 --> 00:28:20,094
a beautiful, accomplished doctor
like yourself?

711
00:28:20,128 --> 00:28:22,496
But is there a cap on happiness?

712
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:24,898
And who couldn't use a little more?

713
00:28:24,933 --> 00:28:27,481
And who couldn't enjoy
sharing it a little?

714
00:28:27,836 --> 00:28:30,904
I could help you
if you'd let me, Dr. Grey.

715
00:28:30,939 --> 00:28:33,774
I'm the UNOS of love.

716
00:28:36,211 --> 00:28:37,614
So, you just moved to Seattle?

717
00:28:37,648 --> 00:28:39,246
- No, I've been here a while.
- Oh.

718
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,814
He was the team doc for the Mariners.

719
00:28:40,849 --> 00:28:43,017
- Do you get tickets, or...?
- Lot of tickets.

720
00:28:43,051 --> 00:28:44,418
- Owen Hunt. Head of trauma.
- I'm Jackson Avery.

721
00:28:44,452 --> 00:28:45,779
- Love the Mariners.
- I don't know if we were

722
00:28:45,804 --> 00:28:47,254
properly introduced ever.

723
00:28:47,288 --> 00:28:49,590
Hey, afternoon, gentlemen.
I heard you have a trauma.

724
00:28:49,624 --> 00:28:51,191
Need an extra set of hands?

725
00:28:51,226 --> 00:28:52,593
Sure. Scrub in.

726
00:28:54,729 --> 00:28:57,931
And how's your first day
going, Dr. Lincoln?

727
00:28:57,966 --> 00:28:59,533
Going great.

728
00:28:59,567 --> 00:29:01,969
Be going even better
if you called me Link.

729
00:29:02,003 --> 00:29:04,171
Oh. Okay, I'll try.

730
00:29:04,205 --> 00:29:05,305
Mm.

731
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:08,342
You know, you may have forgotten
that I was once chief.

732
00:29:08,376 --> 00:29:10,611
Everybody seems to just,
you know, forget that.

733
00:29:10,645 --> 00:29:13,447
I wouldn't touch that job
with a 10-foot pole.

734
00:29:13,482 --> 00:29:15,722
That job comes with stress.

735
00:29:15,756 --> 00:29:18,452
Bones break under stress.

736
00:29:18,486 --> 00:29:20,621
So do souls.

737
00:29:20,655 --> 00:29:22,656
Simple... that's the key to life.

738
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,427
Wha...

739
00:29:28,563 --> 00:29:30,731
Since we couldn't
get it out with the E.U.A.,

740
00:29:30,765 --> 00:29:34,131
<i>we need to open the sigmoid
to access it from above.</i>

741
00:29:35,503 --> 00:29:38,138
All right, we are going to
<i>make an opening</i>

742
00:29:38,173 --> 00:29:39,907
in the sigmoid colon.

743
00:29:39,941 --> 00:29:41,475
Okay, scalpel.

744
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:44,878
Okay, right there. Yeah.

745
00:29:44,913 --> 00:29:46,713
All right, let's pull it back
just a little bit. Yeah.

746
00:29:46,748 --> 00:29:47,881
- Mm-hmm.
- That's good.

747
00:29:54,456 --> 00:29:56,824
Okay. I have this.

748
00:29:56,858 --> 00:29:58,659
Hold on.

749
00:30:01,629 --> 00:30:03,030
Something feels hard.

750
00:30:05,867 --> 00:30:06,900
There's a small bleeder here.

751
00:30:06,935 --> 00:30:08,035
Stop. Wait, okay? I got it.

752
00:30:08,069 --> 00:30:09,791
Let me get a clamp.

753
00:30:12,273 --> 00:30:13,774
Roy, back away!

754
00:30:13,808 --> 00:30:14,842
- Aaah!
- Watch out!

755
00:30:14,876 --> 00:30:17,111
Get down! Look out!

756
00:30:18,813 --> 00:30:21,548
<i>Get more lap pads! He's crashing!</i>

757
00:30:21,583 --> 00:30:23,550
I need some water over here!

758
00:30:24,652 --> 00:30:26,520
Let's get some laps here.

759
00:30:26,554 --> 00:30:27,888
What the hell happened?

760
00:30:27,922 --> 00:30:29,756
It was aerosol hair spray...
not shampoo...

761
00:30:29,791 --> 00:30:31,178
and it exploded. Is he all right?

762
00:30:31,212 --> 00:30:32,251
Yeah.

763
00:30:32,286 --> 00:30:34,261
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm okay.

764
00:30:34,295 --> 00:30:36,964
Thanks, man. You saved my life.

765
00:30:38,233 --> 00:30:40,100
More laps. Hurry.

766
00:30:45,462 --> 00:30:47,663
Got this bleeding under control.

767
00:30:48,522 --> 00:30:50,323
Get me two units of blood.

768
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:52,283
I need two vascular clamps.

769
00:30:52,317 --> 00:30:53,333
More laps here. Okay.

770
00:30:53,368 --> 00:30:55,486
I need to divert with a colostomy.

771
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,654
Okay, more suction in here.

772
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:59,156
Talk to me, Roy.

773
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:00,291
He... He exploded.

774
00:31:00,325 --> 00:31:02,893
Not until after I told you
to back away and you didn't.

775
00:31:02,928 --> 00:31:03,994
Get him out of here.

776
00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:05,296
DeLuca, you were very brave,

777
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:07,765
but I need you to scrub back in and
help me try and stop this bleeding.

778
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:09,392
Yes, sir.

779
00:31:10,168 --> 00:31:11,969
More suction.

780
00:31:12,003 --> 00:31:13,904

781
00:31:15,273 --> 00:31:16,473
Son a bitch.

782
00:31:16,508 --> 00:31:18,442
Okay, well, that's just great.

783
00:31:18,476 --> 00:31:20,277
That's great. All right, all right.

784
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:23,480
All right, let's... let's talk about it.

785
00:31:23,515 --> 00:31:26,750
You were awful to him...
we've established that.

786
00:31:26,785 --> 00:31:29,420
So, if you really want him back now,

787
00:31:29,454 --> 00:31:31,288
you're actually gonna
have to fight for him.

788
00:31:31,323 --> 00:31:33,023
Knock the other player out of the game.

789
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:37,428
Your advice is that I should
fight another woman for a man?

790
00:31:37,946 --> 00:31:39,146
What thing that's worth having

791
00:31:39,181 --> 00:31:40,781
has anyone ever gotten without a fight?

792
00:31:40,816 --> 00:31:42,850
You didn't become a neurosurgeon
without fighting for it.

793
00:31:42,884 --> 00:31:44,785
You didn't come back from a brain tumor

794
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,687
without fighting for it...
you fought like hell.

795
00:31:46,722 --> 00:31:47,688
And if some woman had been standing

796
00:31:47,723 --> 00:31:49,824
between you and your ability
to get out of bed,

797
00:31:49,858 --> 00:31:51,859
you would've fought her, Shepherd.

798
00:31:51,893 --> 00:31:53,627
There might have been Jell-O.

799
00:31:53,662 --> 00:31:54,762
Or mud.

800
00:31:54,796 --> 00:31:56,330
Maybe costumes.

801
00:31:56,365 --> 00:31:58,666
I am not gonna take personal
life advice from you, Tom,

802
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:01,001
because, in that area,
I have no respect for you.

803
00:32:01,036 --> 00:32:02,352
Very smart. I have my flaws.

804
00:32:02,387 --> 00:32:05,473
But I only have one regret in this life,

805
00:32:05,507 --> 00:32:07,786
and that is that I watched my wife

806
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:08,943
walk out the door of our marriage

807
00:32:08,977 --> 00:32:11,413
and into the bed of a man who wasn't me

808
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:13,707
without fighting for her.

809
00:32:14,069 --> 00:32:15,703
It's not anti-feminist
to fight for what you want.

810
00:32:15,737 --> 00:32:18,872
It's anti-Amelia not to.

811
00:32:18,907 --> 00:32:20,741
Will you clean up this melted brain?

812
00:32:20,775 --> 00:32:23,510
It's grossing me out.

813
00:32:27,249 --> 00:32:28,384
Check it out, Nico.

814
00:32:28,418 --> 00:32:30,884
Got to go through
the interior of the femur.

815
00:32:30,919 --> 00:32:33,520
Cool. Can I do it?

816
00:32:33,555 --> 00:32:35,389
Nah, I'm having too much fun.

817
00:32:36,758 --> 00:32:40,561
- You're on tunes. Any requests?
- Your call.

818
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:48,736
There we go. Now I can focus.

819
00:32:49,871 --> 00:32:51,905
A little loud, isn't it?
I can't hear myself think.

820
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:53,107
That's the point.

821
00:32:53,141 --> 00:32:54,427
Surgery's in the hands.

822
00:32:54,461 --> 00:32:57,845
Do it enough times, it's muscle memory.

823
00:32:57,879 --> 00:32:58,946

824
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:01,614
