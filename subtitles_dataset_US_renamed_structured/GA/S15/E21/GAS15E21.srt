Yeah, but we're not
in Seattle.

17
00:00:41,637 --> 00:00:44,174
We're in New York,
and we are doing

18
00:00:44,276 --> 00:00:47,947
a complicated surgery on
New York time in the morning.

19
00:00:48,035 --> 00:00:50,408
Okay, fine.

- No, it's not a rule,

24
00:00:59,715 --> 00:01:02,369
so much as the basic tenet
of this relationship.

25
00:01:02,457 --> 00:01:04,420
- Which is that it's not a relationship?
- Right.

26
00:01:04,508 --> 00:01:06,713
No complications.
My life is already full of them.

27
00:01:06,801 --> 00:01:09,322
But it's not that complicated.
W-We have adjoining rooms.

- Baseball game at Shea Stadium.
- Yeah.

57
00:02:06,874 --> 00:02:09,099
I got to meet my favorite
player, Dwight Gooden.

58
00:02:09,734 --> 00:02:12,716
I remember thinking,
"I'll be back."

59
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:15,550
And the next time was with
the Mariners as the team doctor.

60
00:02:15,638 --> 00:02:16,841
That is impressive.

61
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:18,519
Nothing will beat that
first time out here.

62
00:02:18,606 --> 00:02:20,724
I ate here five times.

63
00:02:20,927 --> 00:02:23,161
Even got a picture out front.

64
00:02:23,318 --> 00:02:24,855
Oh, and there was this
great donut place

65
00:02:24,942 --> 00:02:26,341
right around the corner.
Um...

66
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:28,091
Gotham Donuts!

67
00:02:28,185 --> 00:02:31,028
Oh! Best glazed donut
I've ever had.

68
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,883
That was, uh...

69
00:02:32,974 --> 00:02:35,214
Well, that was our last trip
together before the divorce.

70
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:39,161
Uh, I guess this city
reminds me of better times.

71
00:02:39,966 --> 00:02:43,471
That is the exact
opposite of me.

72
00:02:43,825 --> 00:02:45,012
I grew up here.

73
00:02:45,286 --> 00:02:46,753
Well, not exactly here.

74
00:02:46,841 --> 00:02:49,631
I was like half an hour away
in Westchester.

75
00:02:50,005 --> 00:02:54,927
But my life in New York was
definitely not better times.

76
00:02:56,685 --> 00:03:00,099
Wait. You're saying
we could've had donuts?!

77
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:07,710
- Admit it.
- 14 blocks was not that far.

78
00:03:07,798 --> 00:03:09,381
And when you walk,
you see things

79
00:03:09,469 --> 00:03:11,285
- you never would have from a cab.
- You're right.

80
00:03:11,372 --> 00:03:13,458
We totally would've missed
that group of mimes

81
00:03:13,546 --> 00:03:15,730
- yelling at each other.
- And the rat dragging the bagel.

82
00:03:15,817 --> 00:03:17,104
That was so gross.

83
00:03:17,192 --> 00:03:18,192

84
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,331

87

96
00:03:40,763 --> 00:03:43,542

100
00:03:47,216 --> 00:03:48,263

101

Wow.

103
00:03:52,341 --> 00:03:54,051
You must be very
in demand.

104
00:03:54,138 --> 00:03:56,051
I guess that's why
we never hear from you.

105
00:03:56,247 --> 00:03:57,971
Yep.

106
00:03:58,114 --> 00:04:01,171
Been pretty busy
since I saw you last.

107
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:04,146
I operated on
Catherine Fox herself.

108
00:04:04,234 --> 00:04:05,222
Might've read about it.

109
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:07,143
Also got married.

110
00:04:07,231 --> 00:04:08,261
Aah.

111
00:04:08,505 --> 00:04:10,921
Right. Welcome to the family.

112
00:04:11,161 --> 00:04:13,919
We've got some pretty
deep-seated dysfunction,

113
00:04:14,007 --> 00:04:16,823
but you've probably
figured that out by now.

114
00:04:16,911 --> 00:04:18,435
Ah, what family doesn't?

115
00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:19,849
Do you have sisters?

116
00:04:20,942 --> 00:04:23,628
I do, so I get it.

117
00:04:23,716 --> 00:04:25,052
We should catch up.

118
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:26,698
Come for dinner,
both of you.

119
00:04:26,786 --> 00:04:28,909
Ah! We can't.

120
00:04:28,997 --> 00:04:30,427
Taking off tonight.

121
00:04:30,551 --> 00:04:31,988

122
00:04:32,076 --> 00:04:33,236

- I do.

123
00:04:33,324 --> 00:04:34,892
Oh. Well,

124
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,511
at least
I got to see you.

125
00:04:36,824 --> 00:04:39,011

to do.

129
00:04:50,261 --> 00:04:51,839

132
00:04:56,971 --> 00:04:58,220

133
00:04:58,308 --> 00:05:01,503

Jonah, these are your surgeons,
Doctors Shepherd and Lincoln. Hi.

143
00:05:23,075 --> 00:05:24,438
- Hey.
- Hi.

144
00:05:24,745 --> 00:05:26,714

- Hi.

145
00:05:27,218 --> 00:05:29,135
You know, I-I would've left him

146
00:05:29,222 --> 00:05:30,196
Mm.

147
00:05:30,284 --> 00:05:31,839
Jonah Mays, 18.

148
00:05:31,927 --> 00:05:33,136
He was diagnosed with

149
00:05:33,224 --> 00:05:35,245
progressive kyphoscoliosis
at age 6.

150
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:37,331
He's had multiple
posterior spine fusions

151
00:05:37,419 --> 00:05:39,829
with instrumentation
from T4 to L5

152
00:05:39,917 --> 00:05:40,876
to correct the curvature.

153
00:05:40,964 --> 00:05:43,329
Yeah, it's, uh, pretty much
my entire spinal cord.

154
00:05:43,417 --> 00:05:45,899
I've had... 15 surgeries
in 12 years.

155
00:05:45,987 --> 00:05:48,829
Some due to growth, some due to
the condition's progression.

156
00:05:48,917 --> 00:05:51,181
Yeah, the metal rods bust
right through his skin.

157
00:05:51,269 --> 00:05:52,870
- Can we take a look?
- Yeah.

158
00:05:53,348 --> 00:05:55,041
You're in good hands,
Jonah.

159
00:05:55,175 --> 00:05:56,605
I'll leave you to it.

160
00:06:00,007 --> 00:06:01,618
Looks like the degree
of angulation

161
00:06:01,706 --> 00:06:04,551
- has pushed the hardware off the bolts.
- Mm.

162
00:06:04,638 --> 00:06:06,143
But you... you can fix
that, though, right?

163
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:08,591
Dr. Lincoln and I will
remove the rods.

164
00:06:08,745 --> 00:06:11,806
We'll insert a nylon tether,
which will stabilize your spine.

165
00:06:11,894 --> 00:06:13,260
It'll allow room for growth,
which means

166
00:06:13,347 --> 00:06:14,696
fewer surgeries
in the future.

167
00:06:14,784 --> 00:06:15,801
Good.

168
00:06:15,888 --> 00:06:18,402
'Cause, uh, you know,
I've got big plans.

169
00:06:18,566 --> 00:06:20,409
I'm moving to California.

170
00:06:20,502 --> 00:06:22,394

to UC Berkeley.

- Congratulations.

172
00:06:24,433 --> 00:06:26,301
- Thank you.
- One, uh... One step at a time, bro.

173
00:06:26,388 --> 00:06:28,530
You're worried.
I get it.

174
00:06:28,777 --> 00:06:30,728
I mean, w-who would take you
to physical therapy

175
00:06:30,816 --> 00:06:32,707
and make sure that you got
to the doctor's on time?

176
00:06:32,794 --> 00:06:33,798
Oh, yeah, that's right.

177
00:06:33,886 --> 00:06:35,366
That's what you've always
done for me.

178
00:06:36,098 --> 00:06:37,455
But I won't need it as much,
all right?

179
00:06:37,542 --> 00:06:38,542
Okay.

180
00:06:38,683 --> 00:06:39,671
We've got
your measurements.

181
00:06:39,758 --> 00:06:41,431
We will be back to
prep you for surgery

182
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:43,636
- after we compare them to the scans.
- Okay.

183
00:06:44,717 --> 00:06:47,542
Looks like we can use a vats
to anchor the bolts at T3.

184
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:48,672
Just like we planned.

185
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,881
Should be done by 5:00.

186
00:06:49,968 --> 00:06:51,930
Ah, that gives us almost
another 24 hours

187
00:06:52,018 --> 00:06:53,930
of observation before
we head back to Seattle.

188
00:06:54,018 --> 00:06:55,421
That's amazing news!

189
00:06:55,509 --> 00:06:57,516
I was just gonna leave you
a note,

190
00:06:57,604 --> 00:06:58,688
- trying to...
- What? What?

191
00:06:58,776 --> 00:06:59,766
Uh, what's amazing? What?

192
00:06:59,854 --> 00:07:02,274
I just heard you say
it's at least 24 hours

193
00:07:02,362 --> 00:07:04,353
till your flight leaves,
so you can come for dinner.

194
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,277
John and the kids are upstate
visiting his mom,

195
00:07:06,364 --> 00:07:07,268
so it'll be quiet.

196
00:07:07,356 --> 00:07:08,900
I'll make your favorite
chocolate cream pie.

197
00:07:08,987 --> 00:07:12,719
I... I no longer eat,
um, sugar or gluten.

198
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:14,801
I'm not taking no
for an answer.

199
00:07:15,038 --> 00:07:16,071
Fine, make the pie.

200
00:07:16,159 --> 00:07:17,159
Good.

201
00:07:17,268 --> 00:07:18,971
Text me when
you're on your way.

202
00:07:19,237 --> 00:07:20,421
See ya!

203
00:07:20,651 --> 00:07:21,878
Can't wait!

204
00:07:24,456 --> 00:07:26,300
So...

205
00:07:26,508 --> 00:07:28,211
you like pie, right?

206
00:07:32,745 --> 00:07:34,723
Five minutes in
the lobby is one thing.

207
00:07:34,779 --> 00:07:36,535
Dinner is a terrible idea,
and I'm not going.

208
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:38,092
You can't make me go alone...
It's like sending.

209
00:07:38,179 --> 00:07:39,305
Red Riding Hood
to visit the wolf.

210
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:41,385
I'll be having pizza and donuts
in the city.

211
00:07:41,473 --> 00:07:43,214
- You're more than welcome to j...
- I'm begging.

212
00:07:43,301 --> 00:07:44,659
This is me begging.

213
00:07:44,747 --> 00:07:46,073
Aren't I cute when I beg?

214
00:07:47,497 --> 00:07:50,925
<i>Dr. Kripen, call extension 193.</i>

215
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:52,721
Okay, Jonah.

216
00:07:52,809 --> 00:07:54,003
Pre-op time.

217
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:55,200
Are we leaving now?

218
00:07:55,288 --> 00:07:56,698
Why? You winning?

219
00:07:56,786 --> 00:07:59,323
Yeah. But, uh, also...

220
00:07:59,411 --> 00:08:00,590
Brady went
to the cafeteria.

221
00:08:00,678 --> 00:08:02,113
He said he was gonna
go get an apple,

222
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,911
but, uh, I guarantee you
he comes back with fries.

223
00:08:05,104 --> 00:08:07,465
You know, we have this thing
about saying bye to each other

224
00:08:07,856 --> 00:08:10,895
ever since our parents died
six years ago in a car accident.

225
00:08:11,122 --> 00:08:12,620
And, yeah,
it was as dramatic and tragic

226
00:08:12,707 --> 00:08:14,114
as your face is right now.

227
00:08:14,317 --> 00:08:16,278
Oh, sorry. I...

228
00:08:16,489 --> 00:08:17,917
I'm gonna give you something
to relax you,

229
00:08:18,004 --> 00:08:20,604
and Dr. Lincoln is going to
mark you for surgery.

230
00:08:20,692 --> 00:08:22,175
Cool. What are you
gonna study at Cal?

231
00:08:22,262 --> 00:08:24,190
Uh, environmental science.

232
00:08:24,278 --> 00:08:25,659
Or literature.

233
00:08:25,747 --> 00:08:27,418
Or something
I haven't heard of before.

234
00:08:27,567 --> 00:08:28,721
I-I'm not sure.

235
00:08:28,809 --> 00:08:30,411
Renaissance man.
Nice.

236
00:08:30,528 --> 00:08:32,472
Yeah, well, you know, uh,
knowing what you don't know

237
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,588
is the first step
to enlightenment.

238
00:08:33,675 --> 00:08:36,723
You will fit right in
at Berkeley.

239
00:08:36,844 --> 00:08:38,402
So, did you always know
you wanted to be a doctor?

240
00:08:38,489 --> 00:08:40,612
I have four older siblings
who are all doctors.

241
00:08:40,699 --> 00:08:42,899
I'm not sure it ever occurred
to me to do anything else.

242
00:08:43,829 --> 00:08:45,112
Ah, told ya!

243
00:08:45,199 --> 00:08:46,572
Fries.
You want one?

244
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:47,994
I'm good, thanks.

245
00:08:48,082 --> 00:08:49,697
Uh, but
Jonah's good to go.

246
00:08:49,785 --> 00:08:51,152
Got it, okay.

247
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:52,543
Uh, hold these for me?

248
00:08:52,631 --> 00:08:53,980
Thanks, Doc.

249
00:08:54,542 --> 00:08:56,191
Till next time, brother.

250
00:08:56,613 --> 00:08:58,019
Mm.

251
00:08:58,332 --> 00:08:59,730
Until next time.

252
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:02,213
Here.
And, uh, take that.

253
00:09:02,301 --> 00:09:03,729
You need practice, 'cause
the next time I see you,

254
00:09:03,816 --> 00:09:05,316
I'm-a kick your butt
for real.

255
00:09:05,418 --> 00:09:06,909
Okay.

256
00:09:09,102 --> 00:09:10,434
All right.

257
00:09:13,829 --> 00:09:15,362
Signal looks good.

258
00:09:15,449 --> 00:09:18,488
Good.
Angle looks good.

259
00:09:19,288 --> 00:09:22,605
So... any food allergies?

260
00:09:22,797 --> 00:09:24,098
Nancy will want to know.

261
00:09:24,186 --> 00:09:26,090
Doesn't matter
because I'm not going.

262
00:09:26,178 --> 00:09:27,418
Please?

263
00:09:27,506 --> 00:09:29,566
The begging is cute...
Don't get me wrong.

264
00:09:29,654 --> 00:09:31,340
And still, no.

265
00:09:31,428 --> 00:09:32,574
You shouldn't go,
either.

266
00:09:32,662 --> 00:09:33,705
Life's too short.

267
00:09:33,793 --> 00:09:35,004
Life is too short

268
00:09:35,092 --> 00:09:37,387
for what it will turn into
if I don't go.

269
00:09:37,504 --> 00:09:39,042
One dinner with Nancy,

270
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:41,463
and I avoid months
of family gossip and drama.

271
00:09:41,604 --> 00:09:42,782
They already think
I'm a train wreck.

272
00:09:42,869 --> 00:09:44,723
Well, they're wrong.

273
00:09:44,948 --> 00:09:46,293
Have you met me?

274
00:09:46,598 --> 00:09:47,777
Amelia Shepherd.

275
00:09:47,865 --> 00:09:51,059
Never told my family
I got divorced.

276
00:09:51,429 --> 00:09:53,348
Ready to attach
the tether?

277
00:09:53,989 --> 00:09:55,254
So they don't get you.

278
00:09:55,342 --> 00:09:56,950
And what... they're mad
because you and Owen eloped?

279
00:09:57,037 --> 00:09:58,785
We didn't elope.
We had a wedding.

280
00:09:59,253 --> 00:10:01,707
They were invited.
They just didn't come.

281
00:10:01,795 --> 00:10:04,151
Wait. None of your sisters
were there?

282
00:10:04,239 --> 00:10:05,598
Or my mom.

283
00:10:05,792 --> 00:10:07,335
Or brother.

284
00:10:07,423 --> 00:10:09,336
- He gets a pass.
- Out of the country?

285
00:10:09,424 --> 00:10:11,848
Dead. But probably judging me
from the grave.

286
00:10:11,941 --> 00:10:12,994
It's complicated.

287
00:10:13,082 --> 00:10:15,590
That's some serious
sibling rivalry.

288
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:18,379
Well, not every family
is Jonah and Brady.

289
00:10:18,552 --> 00:10:20,241
So why go to this dinner?

290
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:26,085
I was...
flown to New York

291
00:10:26,173 --> 00:10:28,991
to perform a rare
and complicated surgery.

292
00:10:29,079 --> 00:10:30,532
I'm here
with my "husband,"

293
00:10:30,619 --> 00:10:35,246
who is shockingly handsome
and ever so kind.

294
00:10:35,348 --> 00:10:37,891
This dinner is a chance
for me to... I don't know.

295
00:10:37,979 --> 00:10:39,821
Brag?
Prove them wrong?

296
00:10:39,909 --> 00:10:41,112
I...

297
00:10:41,302 --> 00:10:42,385
I'm not sure.

298
00:10:42,473 --> 00:10:44,362
I'm just sure
that I have to go,

299
00:10:44,449 --> 00:10:46,362
and that,
if you go with me,

300
00:10:46,574 --> 00:10:48,652
I will make it
worth your while

301
00:10:48,739 --> 00:10:52,862
in very creative ways
that you will enjoy.

302
00:10:56,283 --> 00:10:57,480
Where did we meet?

303
00:10:57,568 --> 00:10:58,832
At the hospital.

304
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,623
And how long
have we been together?

305
00:11:00,949 --> 00:11:03,213
Years, but it feels like minutes

306
00:11:03,301 --> 00:11:04,378
- because love is so...
- Okay,

307
00:11:04,465 --> 00:11:06,532
we don't need poetry. We just
need to keep our story straight.

308
00:11:06,619 --> 00:11:07,894
What color are my eyes?

309
00:11:07,982 --> 00:11:10,192
You think they're gonna quiz me
on the color of your eyes?

310
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:11,822
Anything is possible.

Sometimes they look blue,
depending on the...

314
00:11:17,129 --> 00:11:18,160

316
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,343
What is Owen's favorite
pastime?

317
00:11:22,489 --> 00:11:23,652
Blues guitar.

318
00:11:23,746 --> 00:11:24,894
No.

319
00:11:24,982 --> 00:11:27,355
No, watching World War II
movies on PBS.

320
00:11:27,428 --> 00:11:29,550
But blues guitar is mine,
and Nancy's never met Owen,

321
00:11:29,659 --> 00:11:31,121
so can't I just answer
as myself?

322
00:11:31,209 --> 00:11:32,902
Well, I don't know your life.
I know Owen's.

323
00:11:32,989 --> 00:11:34,072
You could learn it.

325

We don't have rings!

326

Half the surgeons I know
don't wear rings.

327
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,452
Right. Right.
Yeah.

328
00:11:41,539 --> 00:11:42,492
We're surgeons.

329
00:11:42,579 --> 00:11:44,254
We're smart.
No rings.

330
00:11:44,342 --> 00:11:45,741
All of that
is actually true.

331
00:11:45,829 --> 00:11:47,742
At least it's just Nancy.

332
00:11:47,829 --> 00:11:49,925
Better her than Liz or...
God forbid... Kathleen.

333
00:11:50,013 --> 00:11:51,833
Kathleen is the worst.
Kathleen's like Martha Stewart

334
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,901
if Martha Stewart also had
a license to diagnose you

335
00:11:53,988 --> 00:11:55,261
with a personality disorder.

336
00:11:55,349 --> 00:11:58,302
Nancy's bossy,
but she's also the most forgiving.

337
00:11:58,390 --> 00:11:59,532
And she does make
a really nice pie.

338
00:11:59,619 --> 00:12:01,488
Plus,
she is gonna love you.

339
00:12:01,878 --> 00:12:07,894
And by you, I mean Owen,
who really likes to...

340
00:12:08,129 --> 00:12:09,252
Watch
World War II movies.

341
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:10,583
Thank you.

342
00:12:10,671 --> 00:12:11,964
You're gonna be great!

343
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:13,199
Also, you can't drink.

344
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:14,652
- Owen doesn't drink.
- He does.

345
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,180

to screw anything up.

Ah, her husband's

350
00:12:25,673 --> 00:12:28,492
They moved here from a different
giant house in Connecticut

351
00:12:28,579 --> 00:12:30,152
after he got
some big promotion.

352
00:12:30,239 --> 00:12:31,314
Wait.

00:12:31,402 --> 00:12:33,031
We never had a honeymoon...
Owen and I.

354
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:34,414
He wanted Mexico,
I wanted Paris,

355
00:12:34,502 --> 00:12:35,612
so we did neither.

356
00:12:35,699 --> 00:12:37,158
Instead of doing both?

357
00:12:37,619 --> 00:12:38,914
Got it. Got it.

358
00:12:39,002 --> 00:12:40,937
No compromises, even
on the honeymoon. Mm.

359
00:12:41,025 --> 00:12:42,171
<i>♪ No, I won't stop ♪</i>

360
00:12:42,259 --> 00:12:43,419
<i>♪ I got my groove, oh, yeah ♪</i>

361
00:12:44,829 --> 00:12:46,628
This is a terrible idea.

362
00:12:46,984 --> 00:12:48,467
Now you figure that out?

363
00:12:48,554 --> 00:12:49,952
<i>♪ With every move I make ♪</i>

364
00:12:50,089 --> 00:12:51,322
You made it.

365
00:12:51,409 --> 00:12:53,526
- We did.
- Come on in.

366
00:12:53,626 --> 00:12:54,829
The house is a mess.

367
00:12:54,917 --> 00:12:55,990
Don't look too close.

368
00:12:56,091 --> 00:12:57,804
<i>♪ S'My kinda happiness ♪</i>

369
00:12:58,079 --> 00:12:59,569
You're right on time.

370
00:12:59,657 --> 00:13:02,240
We were just about to start
on the appetizers.

371
00:13:02,328 --> 00:13:03,476
- We?
- Where do you keep

372
00:13:03,564 --> 00:13:04,632
your corkscrew?

373
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,320
We got to get it in
before she gets here.

374
00:13:06,422 --> 00:13:07,795
Is that...
That sounds like...

375
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:10,612
Kathleen!
You're here!

376
00:13:10,866 --> 00:13:12,426
Kathleen is my...

377
00:13:12,522 --> 00:13:13,692
Other sister.

378
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:14,952
Yep.

379
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:18,032
Well, I guess
I'll put the wine away.

380
00:13:23,822 --> 00:13:26,039
You wouldn't have
come if you knew. No!

381
00:13:26,127 --> 00:13:28,257
Fun!
Family reunion!

382
00:13:28,345 --> 00:13:31,234
Is, uh, Liz gonna pop out
of the closet next? Or Mom?

383
00:13:31,322 --> 00:13:32,782
Please give me
more credit than that.

384
00:13:32,884 --> 00:13:34,605
I wouldn't just
spring Mom on you.

385
00:13:34,692 --> 00:13:36,624
I did call Liz,
but she was out of town.

386
00:13:36,712 --> 00:13:37,855
Ah, too bad.

387
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:39,272
We could've all
compared lives

388
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,586
to make sure yours
are still better.

389
00:13:40,673 --> 00:13:42,251
It's not like that at all.

390
00:13:42,339 --> 00:13:44,866
No. This is about
Nancy's compulsive need

391
00:13:44,954 --> 00:13:46,065
to fix all of us.

392
00:13:46,298 --> 00:13:47,421
We are a family.

393
00:13:47,509 --> 00:13:48,883
We haven't seen each other
in years.

394
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:50,475
You haven't even met Owen.

395
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:52,821
I'm sure we can all be civil
for one night.

396
00:13:54,196 --> 00:13:55,935
- Kathleen.
- Owen.

397
00:13:56,022 --> 00:13:57,605
You were in
the Army, right?

398
00:13:57,692 --> 00:13:59,235
Uh, where
were you stationed?

399
00:13:59,322 --> 00:14:00,735
Iraq. Baghdad.

400
00:14:00,822 --> 00:14:02,395
My husband's traveling there.

401
00:14:02,482 --> 00:14:03,985
H-He's a diplomat.

402
00:14:04,072 --> 00:14:06,065
Any recommendations?

403
00:14:06,152 --> 00:14:09,275
Let's move inside before
we start the interrogation.

404
00:14:09,362 --> 00:14:12,145
The Abbasid Palace
is quite beautiful.

405
00:14:12,232 --> 00:14:13,735
It was, uh, built
in the 12th century

406
00:14:13,822 --> 00:14:14,815
overlooking
the Tigris River.

407
00:14:14,902 --> 00:14:16,735
- I'll mention it.
- Mm.

408
00:14:16,977 --> 00:14:20,516
H-How high does the temperature
get there in July?

409
00:14:21,692 --> 00:14:24,695
It gets, uh, pretty hot.

410
00:14:24,782 --> 00:14:27,727
Um, I'm sorry.
Could I use your restroom?

411
00:14:27,942 --> 00:14:30,145
Of course.
Yeah, I'll show you where.

412
00:14:33,008 --> 00:14:34,855
It's gonna take them
about five minutes

413
00:14:34,942 --> 00:14:36,485
to figure out
I'm not Owen.

414
00:14:36,647 --> 00:14:38,318
You knew about
that palace in Iraq.

415
00:14:38,406 --> 00:14:40,045
Ninth grade World Civ
presentation!

416
00:14:40,133 --> 00:14:41,735
That's about all
I remember.

417
00:14:41,828 --> 00:14:43,605
I-I might've been able
to handle Nancy,

418
00:14:43,692 --> 00:14:46,105
but that Martha Stewart one,
she's got teeth.

419
00:14:46,192 --> 00:14:47,600
Okay. You're right.
We got to get out of here.

420
00:14:47,687 --> 00:14:49,025
I mean, best case scenario,
the whole night's

421
00:14:49,112 --> 00:14:51,025
just them reminding me that
I'm the Shepherd's black sheep.

422
00:14:51,112 --> 00:14:53,275
- I see what you did there.
- That was the nickname

423
00:14:53,362 --> 00:14:54,605
that they gave me
in high school.

424
00:14:54,692 --> 00:14:55,945
Black Sheep.

425
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:57,695
We are not subtle people.

426
00:14:58,109 --> 00:14:59,781
What are we gonna do?

427
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,655
We're gonna go back out there
for a few minutes.

428
00:15:01,742 --> 00:15:03,042
We're gonna say
we got paged to the hospital.

429
00:15:03,129 --> 00:15:05,264
Because we are not
in high school.

430
00:15:05,352 --> 00:15:08,275
We are grown-ass surgeons
with medical emergencies.

431
00:15:08,461 --> 00:15:11,037
- Not in high school.
- Thank you for the reminder.

432
00:15:15,782 --> 00:15:18,195
I'm putting the avocados
on the side for you.

433
00:15:18,282 --> 00:15:20,748
Oh, that's okay.
Uh, Owen loves them,

434
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:22,065
so I sorta got
used to them.

435
00:15:22,152 --> 00:15:23,275
He's great, right?

436
00:15:23,437 --> 00:15:26,105
Oh, I'm sure Kathleen's
got him cornered.

437
00:15:26,477 --> 00:15:28,195
Uh, maybe I should
just go check.

438
00:15:28,282 --> 00:15:30,609
Oh, can you grab that?

439
00:15:36,282 --> 00:15:38,859
You are not at all
what I pictured.

440
00:15:39,692 --> 00:15:41,357
Trauma surgeon.

441
00:15:41,445 --> 00:15:42,645
Army.

442
00:15:43,008 --> 00:15:45,320
I thought you'd be
a lot more...

443
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,065
Rugged?

444
00:15:48,152 --> 00:15:50,065
Armed?

445
00:15:50,897 --> 00:15:51,985
Uptight.

446
00:15:52,072 --> 00:15:55,644
But Amelia loves to be
unpredictable,

447
00:15:55,732 --> 00:15:58,485
so... maybe it makes sense.

448
00:15:58,572 --> 00:16:00,275
It keeps things
interesting.

449
00:16:00,437 --> 00:16:02,565
She has a history
of false starts

450
00:16:02,652 --> 00:16:04,258
when it comes
to weddings.

451
00:16:05,391 --> 00:16:06,952
Well, we're definitely married.

452
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:10,355
I'm saying congrats on not
being abandoned at the altar.

453
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:12,037
She would never do that.

454
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:14,235
Oh, yes, she would.

455
00:16:14,322 --> 00:16:17,070
She is a Houdini-level
escape artist.

456
00:16:17,203 --> 00:16:18,525
First sign
things might get hard,

457
00:16:18,612 --> 00:16:20,485
and she is out the door.

458
00:16:20,572 --> 00:16:22,985
I'm surprised she didn't bolt
when she saw me here.

459
00:16:24,152 --> 00:16:26,645
She thinks
we gang up on her.

460
00:16:26,732 --> 00:16:27,895
She provokes it, though.

461
00:16:27,982 --> 00:16:30,315
Honestly,
I always thought

462
00:16:30,402 --> 00:16:33,669
she was more addicted
to drama than the drugs.

463
00:16:33,757 --> 00:16:35,354
But, I mean...

464
00:16:35,645 --> 00:16:38,416
good thing she found someone
with Army training, right?

465
00:16:38,504 --> 00:16:40,278
What's that old slogan?

466
00:16:40,388 --> 00:16:42,355
"No mission
too difficult"?

467
00:16:42,442 --> 00:16:43,591
Hey!

468
00:16:43,862 --> 00:16:46,195
So, Jonah's scans
came back early.

469
00:16:46,282 --> 00:16:48,112
- We should go.
- Ah.

470
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:52,394
We could review them
in the morning.

471
00:16:52,482 --> 00:16:56,317
Um, I know you were anxious
to see them.

472
00:16:56,405 --> 00:16:58,448
I think we should spend
some time with your family.

473
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:02,653
Oh, um, well, we might need to
look at his labs, though.

474
00:17:02,782 --> 00:17:05,985
Oh, you know,
I just looked at them.

475
00:17:06,294 --> 00:17:09,083
And we're good.

476
00:17:10,152 --> 00:17:12,280
O... kay.

477
00:17:12,368 --> 00:17:13,630
We'll stay.

478
00:17:16,349 --> 00:17:17,972
Do you ever
run into Meredith?

479
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:19,159
I do.

480
00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:21,216
I read she won
a Harper Avery.

481
00:17:21,304 --> 00:17:24,151
Uh, they renamed it the
Catherine Fox Award.

482
00:17:24,239 --> 00:17:26,435
But, yeah.
Uh, she's doing well.

483
00:17:26,607 --> 00:17:29,778
Amelia's doing groundbreaking
research, as well.

484
00:17:30,522 --> 00:17:33,025
Finding non-addictive methods
of pain management.

485
00:17:33,112 --> 00:17:36,638
Well, Amelia would know
how important that is.

486
00:17:40,022 --> 00:17:42,302
How about
I get that wine now?

487
00:17:44,728 --> 00:17:47,061
It's fine. Really.

488
00:17:47,156 --> 00:17:48,477
You should be more
concerned about

489
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:49,695
the pills
in your bathroom.

490
00:17:49,782 --> 00:17:51,308
I don't want to make you
feel uncomfortable.

491
00:17:51,395 --> 00:17:52,565
Too late.

492
00:17:56,942 --> 00:18:01,522
Um... I should take this.

493
00:18:06,152 --> 00:18:07,466
Oh, it's okay.
I'm good.

494
00:18:07,591 --> 00:18:09,652
Go ahead.
Amelia said you love them.

495
00:18:10,822 --> 00:18:12,195
I do!

496
00:18:20,102 --> 00:18:21,565
What's happening?
Is he okay?

497
00:18:21,652 --> 00:18:24,315
Hey. Did you
forget to pack Roodle?

498
00:18:24,402 --> 00:18:25,735
I'm pretty sure
I put it in the bag.

499
00:18:25,822 --> 00:18:26,928
What about the one
your mom got him?

500
00:18:27,015 --> 00:18:28,145
Yeah, I can't find it.

501
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:30,775
That's why we have a backup.

502
00:18:30,862 --> 00:18:32,695
Oh. Try giving him one of his
other stuffed animals.

503
00:18:32,782 --> 00:18:34,208
I'm kind of losing it
over here.

504
00:18:34,296 --> 00:18:36,382
Well, he probably shoved it
in the couch.

505
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:37,645
Okay, it's not...
It's not here.

506
00:18:37,732 --> 00:18:39,275
It's not... wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait!

507
00:18:39,362 --> 00:18:41,275
Here. Found it.
Here's Roodle.

508
00:18:41,362 --> 00:18:43,275
There you go.
Thank you.

509
00:18:43,618 --> 00:18:44,821
Can I ask you
a question?

510
00:18:45,086 --> 00:18:46,145
Sure.

511
00:18:46,232 --> 00:18:48,235
What's the temperature like
in Baghdad in July?

512
00:18:48,322 --> 00:18:49,895
Well, once it got
to 130 degrees,

513
00:18:49,982 --> 00:18:51,145
and I cooked eggplant
in the sun. Why?

514
00:18:51,232 --> 00:18:52,935
Uhhhh, no reason.

515
00:18:53,022 --> 00:18:55,105
Okay. Thank you. Sure.

516
00:18:55,192 --> 00:18:56,695
Roodle's back.

517
00:18:56,783 --> 00:18:58,445
Roodle is back!

518
00:19:29,612 --> 00:19:31,565
- Oh, my God!
- No.

519
00:19:31,652 --> 00:19:32,841
No way!

520
00:19:32,929 --> 00:19:34,695
I don't believe you.

521
00:19:34,782 --> 00:19:37,435
- Oh!
- What's, uh, going on?

522
00:19:37,522 --> 00:19:40,757
Owen claims he can debone
the fish in one fell swoop.

523
00:19:40,845 --> 00:19:42,126
Well, you know, I work a lot with

524
00:19:42,213 --> 00:19:43,485
- bones as a, uh...
- Trauma surgeon.

525
00:19:43,572 --> 00:19:45,855
I'm impressed he knows
it's called a paring knife.

526
00:19:45,942 --> 00:19:48,645
I-I'm not
convinced anyone can do it.

527
00:19:48,732 --> 00:19:51,695
Can and...

528
00:19:52,461 --> 00:19:53,574
- did.
- Aah!

529
00:19:53,695 --> 00:19:55,162
Oh, my God!

530
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:56,841
Can you do that on people?

531
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:59,525
Uh, never tried,
so I'll just say yes.

532
00:19:59,612 --> 00:20:02,453
Oh! We love him.

533
00:20:02,652 --> 00:20:04,859
And I love her.

534
00:20:06,402 --> 00:20:09,921
Okay. There's just one thing
I don't understand.

535
00:20:10,282 --> 00:20:14,257
Out of all of us, how did you
end up with the hottest husband?

536
00:20:14,577 --> 00:20:15,644
Aah!

537
00:20:15,732 --> 00:20:17,921
- Ooh!
- What? Ah!

538
00:20:18,009 --> 00:20:21,382
Amelia was raving about
your pie on the way over.

539
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,713
You just
made Nancy's day.

540
00:20:23,942 --> 00:20:25,336
I-I'll take
half that piece.

541
00:20:25,424 --> 00:20:28,044
Oh, you can put the other one
right on my plate.

542
00:20:28,132 --> 00:20:31,525
I hear my girls!

543
00:20:31,612 --> 00:20:33,560
I didn't call her. I swear!

544
00:20:33,648 --> 00:20:35,195
I may have accidentally
mentioned it.

545
00:20:35,282 --> 00:20:37,302
This place
is so obnoxiously huge,

546
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:39,701
I can never
find my way...

547
00:20:39,789 --> 00:20:41,895
There's my baby girl!

548
00:20:41,982 --> 00:20:44,145
Oh!
Hi, Mom!

549
00:20:44,232 --> 00:20:46,586
Oho, oh!

550
00:20:46,822 --> 00:20:48,201
Let me look at you.

551
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:49,605
- Gorgeous!
- Mm!

552
00:20:49,906 --> 00:20:52,195
Oh, I've always liked you with
shorter hair.

553
00:20:52,282 --> 00:20:53,748
Are you going gray
under there?

554
00:20:53,836 --> 00:20:55,145
Because your grandmother
was completely white

555
00:20:55,232 --> 00:20:56,474
by the time she was 35.

556
00:20:56,562 --> 00:20:57,695
Mom, please.

557
00:20:57,782 --> 00:20:59,605
And who is this
handsome fellow?

558
00:20:59,692 --> 00:21:01,775
This is my husband, Owen.

559
00:21:02,111 --> 00:21:03,314
No, it's not.

560
00:21:03,461 --> 00:21:05,605
Of course it is.
And he's fantastic.

561
00:21:05,692 --> 00:21:07,775
You know, we were surprised,
too, but she picked a good one.

562
00:21:07,862 --> 00:21:09,195
Well,
I'm sure he's great.

563
00:21:09,282 --> 00:21:11,525
But when I visited Derek,

564
00:21:11,718 --> 00:21:13,395
I met Owen Hunt.

565
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:15,101
And this is not him.

566
00:21:18,112 --> 00:21:20,235
Okay.

567
00:21:20,322 --> 00:21:21,985
I'm getting the wine.

568
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:23,395
Uh-huh.

569
00:21:28,265 --> 00:21:31,035
Who is he?
Who are you?

570
00:21:31,147 --> 00:21:35,064
He's my friend and colleague,
Atticus Lincoln.

571
00:21:35,176 --> 00:21:36,544
You can call me Link.

572
00:21:36,631 --> 00:21:38,224
What the hell
were you thinking?

573
00:21:38,312 --> 00:21:39,385
She wasn't.

574
00:21:39,473 --> 00:21:40,892
That's the narcissism.

575
00:21:40,979 --> 00:21:42,059
Were you even married?

576
00:21:42,147 --> 00:21:43,381
Yes! Yes!

577
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:47,059
Owen and I were married,
and now... we're not.

578
00:21:47,152 --> 00:21:48,374
You're separated?

579
00:21:48,461 --> 00:21:49,699
Divorced.

580
00:21:49,787 --> 00:21:51,387
You were married
less than a year.

581
00:21:51,631 --> 00:21:52,545
Actually, a little more.

582
00:21:52,632 --> 00:21:54,294
But less than two.

583
00:21:54,381 --> 00:21:56,004
I guess.
What... What does it matter?

584
00:21:56,091 --> 00:21:57,914
Nancy and Liz owe me 50 bucks.

585
00:21:59,527 --> 00:22:00,664
You bet I'd get divorced?

586
00:22:00,751 --> 00:22:02,051
For what it's worth,

587
00:22:02,139 --> 00:22:03,374
I thought it would last
longer than it did.

588
00:22:03,461 --> 00:22:04,744
Okay,
you bet on my marriage

589
00:22:04,831 --> 00:22:06,138
after you didn't come
to my wedding?

590
00:22:06,225 --> 00:22:08,105
You didn't come to my wedding.
You were in jail.

591
00:22:08,215 --> 00:22:09,230
She came to mine.

592
00:22:09,318 --> 00:22:10,799
Uncle Ron walked in on her

593
00:22:10,887 --> 00:22:12,084
screwing that usher
in the coat room.

594
00:22:12,171 --> 00:22:14,204
I would've come
with proper notice,

595
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:18,044
but I'd barely heard of Owen
before the invitations arrived.

596
00:22:18,131 --> 00:22:20,414
I didn't know if there
was going to be a wedding.

597
00:22:20,501 --> 00:22:23,111
Okay, do you have any idea how
hurtful and insulting that...

598
00:22:23,199 --> 00:22:25,650
This is why I didn't even
bother to call you

599
00:22:25,738 --> 00:22:27,097
when I found out
I had a brain tumor.

600
00:22:27,184 --> 00:22:28,794
This is why.

601
00:22:28,934 --> 00:22:30,504
Amelia Frances Shepherd,

602
00:22:30,591 --> 00:22:34,204
you have a brain tumor and you
didn't tell your mother?!

603
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:36,457
You have a brain tumor?

604
00:22:36,895 --> 00:22:39,123
Are we supposed to feel better
that your fake husband

605
00:22:39,211 --> 00:22:40,794
doesn't know, either?
Had.

606
00:22:40,881 --> 00:22:44,544
I h... I had
a benign Grade I Meningioma

607
00:22:44,631 --> 00:22:45,760
that they removed.

608
00:22:45,848 --> 00:22:46,892
Completely?

609
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:49,010
'Cause this seems pretty
brain damaged.

610
00:22:49,098 --> 00:22:50,794
I'd say more
like delusional.

611
00:22:50,881 --> 00:22:53,455
But, you know,
par for the course.

612
00:22:53,543 --> 00:22:55,414
Remember when she
bought herself that ring

613
00:22:55,501 --> 00:22:56,954
and she told us all
she was engaged

614
00:22:57,041 --> 00:22:58,543
to that guy
she dated in high school?

615
00:22:58,631 --> 00:22:59,987
He couldn't afford to
buy the ring himself.

616
00:23:00,074 --> 00:23:01,791
She got my car stuck
in the ditch,

617
00:23:01,879 --> 00:23:04,158
walked home,
said somebody must've stolen it,

618
00:23:04,246 --> 00:23:05,314
but left the keys inside.

619
00:23:05,402 --> 00:23:07,374
That was years ago,
and I made amends!

620
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:10,196
Or when she was so drunk
at Uncle Adam's funeral

621
00:23:10,284 --> 00:23:11,874
that she dropped
her end of the casket.

622
00:23:11,961 --> 00:23:14,190
I wasn't drunk.
I was high.

623
00:23:14,292 --> 00:23:16,624
And, yeah,
I had some bad years.

624
00:23:16,711 --> 00:23:18,369
You don't have to bring up
every transgression.

625
00:23:18,456 --> 00:23:21,334
Yeah,
we don't have that kind of time.

626
00:23:21,421 --> 00:23:24,414
The point is all that crazy
happened before the brain tumor.

627
00:23:24,501 --> 00:23:25,744
You've always been
impulsive.

628
00:23:25,831 --> 00:23:27,204
You don't think
things through

629
00:23:27,291 --> 00:23:29,004
or the impact they're gonna
have on other people.

630
00:23:29,091 --> 00:23:30,374
You just do whatever
the hell you want.

631
00:23:30,461 --> 00:23:33,044
Yeah, and then you concoct
these preposterous stories

632
00:23:33,131 --> 00:23:35,004
to cover the truth that
inevitably surfaces.

633
00:23:35,091 --> 00:23:36,504
Okay, girls, that's enough.

634
00:23:36,591 --> 00:23:38,089
Bringing fake Owen
to dinner tonight

635
00:23:38,177 --> 00:23:40,373
might just be the most demented
thing you've ever done.

636
00:23:40,461 --> 00:23:41,993
And if
you're really clean now,

637
00:23:42,081 --> 00:23:44,558
then we can't blame the drugs
or the tumor,

638
00:23:44,646 --> 00:23:46,769
which brings us
back to personality disorder.

639
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:48,473
Okay, you don't know me.

640
00:23:48,847 --> 00:23:50,704
You have not seen me
for years.

641
00:23:50,791 --> 00:23:53,334
I am trapped in your minds
and on your stairs

642
00:23:53,421 --> 00:23:56,124
at about 14 years old, and I am
not that person anymore.

643
00:23:56,211 --> 00:23:57,954
I am sober.

644
00:23:58,386 --> 00:23:59,834
I am responsible.

645
00:23:59,921 --> 00:24:02,915
And I am a neurosurgeon
at the top of my field.

646
00:24:03,003 --> 00:24:05,044
I save lives every day.

647
00:24:05,323 --> 00:24:06,794
In fact,
I am the chief of neuro

648
00:24:06,881 --> 00:24:09,329
at one of the top hospitals
in the country.

649
00:24:09,417 --> 00:24:12,558
Because Derek was moving
and gave you the job.

650
00:24:15,874 --> 00:24:21,367
Listen, um
I'm new to, uh, all of this.

651
00:24:21,683 --> 00:24:23,544
And I haven't known Amelia
that long,

652
00:24:23,631 --> 00:24:26,026
but I wanted us to stay
for dinner tonight

653
00:24:26,114 --> 00:24:28,204
so you could meet the woman that
I've been getting to know,

654
00:24:28,291 --> 00:24:30,509
because she is not at all
the person you are describing.

655
00:24:30,597 --> 00:24:31,230
Link,
you don't have to...

656
00:24:31,318 --> 00:24:34,618
She is a brilliant
surgeon,

657
00:24:34,706 --> 00:24:37,892
the kind you fly across the
country when you need the best.

658
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:39,167
She just performed
a surgery

659
00:24:39,255 --> 00:24:42,087
that very few human beings
on the planet can do.

660
00:24:42,175 --> 00:24:44,954
She is a respected
teacher and mentor.

661
00:24:45,041 --> 00:24:47,334
She cares about her patients
and her colleagues.

662
00:24:47,421 --> 00:24:52,124
And she's beautiful and funny
and kind and strong.

663
00:24:52,211 --> 00:24:53,855
They're sleeping together,
right?

664
00:24:53,964 --> 00:24:55,972
Obviously. She's overcome
a lot of adversity.

665
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:58,892
And, sure, she feels
her feelings in a big way,

666
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:00,627
but that makes her better
than most people I know,

667
00:25:00,714 --> 00:25:02,454
not worse,
because it makes her authentic.

668
00:25:02,581 --> 00:25:07,414
She was an amazing mom to Betty,
and still kinda is to Leo.

669
00:25:07,501 --> 00:25:09,294
I mean, even if she doesn't
have legal custody,

670
00:25:09,381 --> 00:25:10,704
that baby is so lucky
to have her in his...

671
00:25:10,791 --> 00:25:11,830
Wait...
Did you just say "mom"?

672
00:25:11,917 --> 00:25:13,504
Did you say "baby"?

673
00:25:13,591 --> 00:25:15,374
Well... crap.

674
00:25:15,461 --> 00:25:16,504
You have a baby?

675
00:25:16,591 --> 00:25:18,571
Baby or tumor...
Which is crazier?

676
00:25:18,776 --> 00:25:20,542
Who's Betty?
I'm going with baby.

677
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:22,933
You never tell me
anything.

678
00:25:24,767 --> 00:25:26,937
Come on.

679
00:25:31,591 --> 00:25:33,414
Houdini.

680
00:25:38,291 --> 00:25:39,914
You okay?

681
00:25:45,067 --> 00:25:46,100
I said we shouldn't go.

682
00:25:46,251 --> 00:25:47,813
I said we shouldn't stay!

683
00:25:47,901 --> 00:25:48,977
Wow, okay.

684
00:25:49,065 --> 00:25:52,134
So your sisters
are terrorists,

685
00:25:52,222 --> 00:25:54,084
but now
I'm your problem?

686
00:25:59,034 --> 00:26:00,504
Look, everything
was going fine

687
00:26:00,591 --> 00:26:03,370
until your mom called us
on our bluff.

688
00:26:03,921 --> 00:26:05,440
And I know it got
a little rough...

689
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:07,105
A little rough?

690
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,624
It was a lifetime

691
00:26:09,711 --> 00:26:12,414
of humiliating mistakes
and dirty laundry on display.

692
00:26:12,501 --> 00:26:13,704
I don't care
about your laundry.

693
00:26:13,791 --> 00:26:16,315
No, I care.
You were pain management.

694
00:26:16,409 --> 00:26:17,774
You were
my human blue light,

695
00:26:17,862 --> 00:26:19,385
mood-enhancing
when placed over my body.

696
00:26:19,472 --> 00:26:20,517
And now you know too much.

697
00:26:20,605 --> 00:26:23,118
And I'm... I can't.

698
00:26:27,881 --> 00:26:29,504
Son of a...

699
00:26:29,667 --> 00:26:31,370
Jonah's in respiratory
distress.

700
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,493
We need to get to
Fox Medical Center in Manhattan,

701
00:26:33,581 --> 00:26:35,450
please,
as fast as you can.

702
00:26:39,292 --> 00:26:41,468
- He's bending by the minute.
- He's exaggerating.

703
00:26:41,602 --> 00:26:43,771
I'm fine.
I'll... I'll be okay.

704
00:26:43,859 --> 00:26:46,487
Ow! Jonah,
we took a look at your scans,

705
00:26:46,575 --> 00:26:47,621
- and the tether just doesn't...
- Oh, please don't say it.

706
00:26:47,708 --> 00:26:48,653
Your lungs
are compressed.

707
00:26:48,741 --> 00:26:50,465
We're gonna have to replace
the rod so you can breathe.

708
00:26:50,552 --> 00:26:53,661
But, uh, I-I have to...
I have plans.

709
00:26:53,749 --> 00:26:56,112
W-W-What if we tighten
the tether?

710
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,628
That's not how it works.
I'm sorry.

711
00:26:57,716 --> 00:26:58,857
The rods don't work.

712
00:26:59,474 --> 00:27:02,175
Okay, I-I'll need new ones again
by the end of the year.

713
00:27:02,263 --> 00:27:03,621
The tether didn't even
last for a day.

714
00:27:03,708 --> 00:27:04,997
- W-What if...
- Jonah, they said

715
00:27:05,085 --> 00:27:06,250
there's no other way, okay?

716
00:27:06,338 --> 00:27:07,461
T-There's always
another way.

717
00:27:07,548 --> 00:27:09,381
That's what you said
when Mom and Dad died.

718
00:27:09,732 --> 00:27:11,211
I-I was scared because

719
00:27:11,298 --> 00:27:13,761
of how many people want to adopt
somebody with my condition...

720
00:27:13,849 --> 00:27:15,520
and you said that you'd
find a way, and you did.

721
00:27:15,607 --> 00:27:17,496
You quit law school
so you could take care of me.

722
00:27:17,583 --> 00:27:19,341
You can still have
big plans. Okay?

723
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:21,949
- Take classes here at community co...
- That's not what I want!

724
00:27:22,968 --> 00:27:24,700
There has to be
something else.

725
00:27:25,442 --> 00:27:27,278
A vertebral column
resection.

726
00:27:27,468 --> 00:27:29,251
- What's that?
- Dr. Shepherd!

727
00:27:29,552 --> 00:27:32,433
We would remove the vertebrae
causing the curvature

728
00:27:32,521 --> 00:27:34,089
and replace it
with a titanium cage

729
00:27:34,177 --> 00:27:35,644
that would protect
your spinal cord.

730
00:27:35,732 --> 00:27:38,042
It's a very risky,
very complex surgery

731
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:39,418
with many potential
complications.

732
00:27:39,505 --> 00:27:41,621
It could result
in paralysis, even death.

733
00:27:41,708 --> 00:27:43,249
Mm. But if it works?

734
00:27:44,217 --> 00:27:46,184
It would permanently correct
the deformity.

735
00:27:46,272 --> 00:27:47,512
You can...
You can do it now?

736
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,920
- I don't recommend it.
- Yes.

737
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,280
It is risky.

738
00:27:53,128 --> 00:27:55,663
But if you decide that it's
what you want, we could do it.

739
00:27:56,338 --> 00:27:58,397
- I want it.
- No, no, no, no way.

740
00:28:00,088 --> 00:28:03,331
Look, man.
You've... Y-You had everything.

741
00:28:03,482 --> 00:28:06,686
Yale Law School,
tons of friends,

742
00:28:06,811 --> 00:28:08,561
an awesome girlfriend.

743
00:28:08,649 --> 00:28:10,452
Y-Y-You were even c-captain

744
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:12,874
of that weird ultimate
Frisbee team.

745
00:28:13,008 --> 00:28:14,685
Hey, man, we were...
We were league champions.

746
00:28:14,772 --> 00:28:16,217
You gave up everything.

747
00:28:16,968 --> 00:28:19,278
Now you have h-hospital food
and waiting rooms.

748
00:28:19,366 --> 00:28:21,155
I like the fries here.

749
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:23,541
You're the world's
best brother.

750
00:28:24,374 --> 00:28:27,291
Okay?
Y-You're my personal hero.

751
00:28:28,835 --> 00:28:30,022
But I'm 18.

752
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:31,921
I want this surgery, and I'm
gonna do it no matter what.

753
00:28:32,008 --> 00:28:34,331
But I'd rather have you on...
On my side.

754
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:38,114
I can't lose you, too.

755
00:28:38,202 --> 00:28:39,270
You're not gonna lose me.

756
00:28:39,358 --> 00:28:40,999
This isn't the part
where I die.

757
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:46,631
This is the part where
I'm brave and it pays off.

758
00:28:47,628 --> 00:28:49,001
Look at her.

759
00:28:49,194 --> 00:28:50,879
Look at her eyes.

760
00:28:53,021 --> 00:28:54,506
She says she can do it.

761
00:29:03,771 --> 00:29:05,290
Until next time, brother.

762
00:29:05,499 --> 00:29:07,331
Until next time.

763
00:29:11,652 --> 00:29:13,553
He asked
about his options.

764
00:29:16,417 --> 00:29:17,790
We could paralyze him.

765
00:29:18,178 --> 00:29:20,754
A woman
just became quadriplegic

766
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:23,129
- on our table.
- That was out of our control.

767
00:29:23,217 --> 00:29:24,653
Exactly.
There are no guarantees.

768
00:29:24,741 --> 00:29:25,771
Our patient
has to come first.

769
00:29:25,858 --> 00:29:27,700
I am putting him first.
This is what he wants.

770
00:29:27,788 --> 00:29:28,881
This is what you want

771
00:29:28,968 --> 00:29:30,671
because you've still
got something to prove.

772
00:29:30,758 --> 00:29:32,638
Do I need to find someone else
to do this with me?

773
00:29:32,725 --> 00:29:33,418
Because I will.

774
00:29:33,506 --> 00:29:36,749
Amelia, I'm saying
it's been... a rough night.

775
00:29:36,899 --> 00:29:40,812
I'm saying y-your sisters just
treated you like a teenager.

776
00:29:41,048 --> 00:29:42,501
They questioned
your surgical skills.

777
00:29:42,588 --> 00:29:44,145
I can't care
what they think.

778
00:29:44,233 --> 00:29:45,920
You think you don't care?!

779
00:29:46,069 --> 00:29:47,921
I just spent the night
pretending I was Owen!

780
00:29:48,008 --> 00:29:50,827
This is not about them!
I cannot let them define me!

781
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:53,426
If I did, I would still be the
messed-up baby of the family,

782
00:29:53,514 --> 00:29:55,380
the person that I revert to
when I am with them.

783
00:29:55,467 --> 00:29:58,311
- And that is not who I am!
- I know that!

784
00:29:59,077 --> 00:30:01,631
I'm asking
if you know that.

785
00:30:03,338 --> 00:30:05,621
I'm asking
if you're okay.

786
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:07,881
I'm asking
if you are sure

787
00:30:07,968 --> 00:30:09,934
you're not doing this surgery
to prove something

788
00:30:10,022 --> 00:30:13,217
to people who clearly have
no understanding of you at all.

789
00:30:21,795 --> 00:30:23,741
Jonah deserves a life

790
00:30:24,467 --> 00:30:27,561
that is more than a cycle
of surgery after surgery.

791
00:30:30,569 --> 00:30:32,291
It's what he wants.

792
00:30:32,697 --> 00:30:34,241
And I know I can do it.

793
00:30:37,179 --> 00:30:38,639
Okay.

794
00:30:40,522 --> 00:30:43,750
<i>♪ I remember the minute ♪</i>

795
00:30:43,838 --> 00:30:45,122

796

- Get me the titanium cage.
- <i>♪ I was just a kid ♪</i>

798
00:30:49,053 --> 00:30:50,581

802
00:31:03,305 --> 00:31:04,552
We just lost the signal.

803
00:31:04,639 --> 00:31:05,778
The cage spread too far.

804
00:31:05,866 --> 00:31:07,255
There's too much traction
on the spinal cord.

805
00:31:07,342 --> 00:31:09,452
<i>♪ I was little, I was weak,

806

807
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:13,233

00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:26,428
- Shh! Please.
- <i>♪ And all I've lost in the fight to protect it ♪</i>

00:31:32,706 --> 00:31:33,704

No neurological deficits.
How do you feel?

828
00:32:32,582 --> 00:32:33,995
Like I'm going to Cali.

829
00:32:34,082 --> 00:32:35,934
How long should he, uh,
stay off his feet?

830
00:32:36,022 --> 00:32:37,840
A day or two.
It's good for him to walk.

831
00:32:37,928 --> 00:32:39,285
Ease into it, though.

832
00:32:39,372 --> 00:32:41,154
Your doctors here will
oversee your follow-up,

833
00:32:41,241 --> 00:32:42,426
but you know
how to reach us.

834
00:32:42,514 --> 00:32:43,825
Wait. So that's it?

835
00:32:44,044 --> 00:32:46,895
You guys change my whole damn
life and then you just leave?

836
00:32:46,983 --> 00:32:48,405
Well, come see us.

837
00:32:48,522 --> 00:32:50,582
Seattle is a short plane ride
away from Berkeley.

838
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:51,889
True.

839
00:32:52,396 --> 00:32:53,864
Thank you.

840
00:32:54,139 --> 00:32:55,365
Thank you guys for...

841
00:32:55,755 --> 00:32:57,052
giving me a future.

842
00:32:57,139 --> 00:32:58,397
You were brave.

843
00:32:58,873 --> 00:33:00,522
And it paid off.

844
00:33:08,998 --> 00:33:10,717
Thank you, uh, for...

845
00:33:12,373 --> 00:33:13,694
Thank you.

846
00:33:14,096 --> 00:33:16,819
You were brave,
and it paid off.

847
00:33:18,202 --> 00:33:20,967
Do you want to go for, uh...
get something to eat?

848
00:33:22,662 --> 00:33:24,035
No, um...

849
00:33:24,295 --> 00:33:25,959
No, I need to walk.

850
00:33:26,592 --> 00:33:27,927
I'll see you on the plane.

851
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:35,361
Brady.

852
00:33:35,449 --> 00:33:36,498
You okay?

853
00:33:36,622 --> 00:33:37,872
Yeah.

854
00:33:39,551 --> 00:33:41,154
I just don't know
what to do.

855
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:44,301
Jonah's gonna be fine.

856
00:33:44,389 --> 00:33:47,270
I know.
And I'm glad.

857
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:48,495
I just...

858
00:33:48,582 --> 00:33:51,865
I don't know what I'm gonna do...
without him, you know?

859
00:33:51,952 --> 00:33:54,082
Would it be weird,
you know...

860
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:55,255
W-w-would it...
Would it be weird

861
00:33:55,342 --> 00:33:56,817
if I just followed him
to California

862
00:33:56,905 --> 00:33:59,387
and just... I don't know...
Was... was nearby?

863
00:33:59,475 --> 00:34:00,245
Was...

864
00:34:00,332 --> 00:34:02,202
- I mean, he's...
- He's your brother.

865
00:34:03,591 --> 00:34:04,952
I get it.

866
00:34:05,806 --> 00:34:07,967
I miss my brother
every day.

867
00:34:10,202 --> 00:34:12,626
But maybe try not to
follow him to college.

868
00:34:12,714 --> 00:34:13,887
Yeah.

869
00:34:13,975 --> 00:34:17,285
Maybe try to give him
some breathing room

870
00:34:17,372 --> 00:34:21,772
to become whoever he is
outside your shadow.

871
00:34:24,373 --> 00:34:25,445
And then visit.

872
00:34:25,532 --> 00:34:27,412
Yeah.

873

Thank you.

874
00:34:48,373 --> 00:34:49,772
Hey, kiddo.

875
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:56,155
Can we... go somewhere
and, uh, talk?

876
00:35:02,162 --> 00:35:04,561
What... What happened
with Owen?

877
00:35:05,492 --> 00:35:08,795
It just...
didn't work out.

878
00:35:10,379 --> 00:35:13,295
Do you think I sabotage
relationships?

879
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,744
That I don't know
how to love?

880
00:35:21,787 --> 00:35:23,537
Well.

881
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:25,723
That answers that.

882
00:35:27,122 --> 00:35:29,285
<i>I got you!</i>

883
00:35:31,372 --> 00:35:33,801
I remember when you were
learning to ride a bike.

884
00:35:33,889 --> 00:35:36,115
Derek and your sisters

885
00:35:36,241 --> 00:35:37,655
were zipping
all over the neighborhood,

886
00:35:37,742 --> 00:35:39,559
and you were desperate
to join them.

887
00:35:39,647 --> 00:35:40,934
And so you...
You, uh, pulled

888
00:35:41,037 --> 00:35:42,621
that old purple bike
out of the shed.

889
00:35:42,709 --> 00:35:43,567
You know,
the one with the...

890
00:35:43,655 --> 00:35:45,115
the streamers
hanging off the handlebars.

891
00:35:45,202 --> 00:35:46,536
- Mm.
- Those things were all ripped out

892
00:35:46,623 --> 00:35:47,906
by the time
that bike was mine.

893
00:35:47,993 --> 00:35:51,154
And you refused
to use training wheels

894
00:35:51,242 --> 00:35:52,896
because you said that
was for babies.

895
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:54,464
And you wouldn't
let me help, either.

896
00:35:54,552 --> 00:35:58,371
I had to... I had to spy on you
from the kitchen window.

897
00:35:58,459 --> 00:36:00,043
You don't know
how hard that was.

898
00:36:00,427 --> 00:36:02,427
Watching you fall
over and over again.

899
00:36:03,832 --> 00:36:06,050
My other kids didn't like
to fail, but... but you...

900
00:36:06,138 --> 00:36:07,675
Okay.
Yeah, Mom, I get it.

901
00:36:07,763 --> 00:36:09,905
One time you took this...
This big spill,

902
00:36:09,992 --> 00:36:12,245
and you... and you
ripped open your pants.

903
00:36:12,332 --> 00:36:14,042
And by the time
I ran out,

904
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:17,841
you had... pulled that-
that old ratty bike up,

905
00:36:17,929 --> 00:36:19,481
and... and you were
halfway down the block.

906
00:36:19,568 --> 00:36:21,445
Every time you fell down,

907
00:36:21,532 --> 00:36:23,365
you got up
and came back stronger.

908
00:36:23,452 --> 00:36:26,655
But not that you... that you
didn't care about falling,

909
00:36:26,742 --> 00:36:30,162
but... just
you weren't afraid of it.

910
00:36:32,771 --> 00:36:34,287
And that's
what made you...

911
00:36:34,564 --> 00:36:35,847
What makes you...

912
00:36:35,935 --> 00:36:38,044
Out of all the kids...

913
00:36:39,121 --> 00:36:40,704
the most
like your father.

914
00:36:46,857 --> 00:36:48,325
After he died,
it was hard

915
00:36:48,412 --> 00:36:52,076
to... be around any...

916
00:36:53,082 --> 00:36:56,755
