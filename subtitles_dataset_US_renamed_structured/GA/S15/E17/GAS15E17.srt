Did you spend the night here
again last night?

19
00:00:52,569 --> 00:00:54,867
Yeah. One of the lambs
had a rough night.

It's a peace offering.

Yeah, I-I'm not going on

00:02:24,126 --> 00:02:26,597

but television?

58

Plus, it's not even
about medicine anymore.

59
00:02:29,581 --> 00:02:31,749
It's... It's "Genius surgeon finds out

62
00:02:34,777 --> 00:02:35,853
I'm morning show fodder.

63
00:02:35,938 --> 00:02:38,689
You're in the genius surgeon
segment, okay?

64
00:02:38,774 --> 00:02:41,459
It's not like you're going in
there to make French toast.

65
00:02:41,544 --> 00:02:43,105
No, that would be the worst
segment in the world.

66
00:02:43,191 --> 00:02:44,488
They'd just be watching me
fishing around

67
00:02:44,574 --> 00:02:45,917
looking for eggshells
with my fingers.

68
00:02:46,003 --> 00:02:47,219
Yet I would still pay
to see that.

69
00:02:48,717 --> 00:02:50,101
So you're saying
I shouldn't cancel it?

70
00:02:50,186 --> 00:02:51,235
I'm saying it shoots tomorrow,

71
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,703
and it's too late to cancel.

72
00:02:52,788 --> 00:02:55,072

00:02:55,228 --> 00:02:56,907

It's not?

82
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:16,189
Then why?

83
00:03:17,413 --> 00:03:19,228
This is why.

84
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:22,884

85
00:03:23,306 --> 00:03:24,994

91
00:03:41,704 --> 00:03:42,837
Have y-you seen it?

92
00:03:42,923 --> 00:03:46,135
The little laminated lambs
kicking in their little bags.

93
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,758
- It's pretty amazing, huh?
- When I look

94
00:03:47,844 --> 00:03:49,665
at the fetal lamb in a bag,

95
00:03:49,751 --> 00:03:52,869
I imagine the next step would
be a fetal human in a bag.

96
00:03:52,955 --> 00:03:54,556
And if anything
goes wrong with that,

97
00:03:54,642 --> 00:03:56,697
we are in an ethical
and legal quagmire

98
00:03:56,783 --> 00:04:00,360
that you created and will have
left me holding the... quag.

99
00:04:00,478 --> 00:04:02,553
That's funny, but I imagine
rewriting the paradigm

100
00:04:02,638 --> 00:04:03,804
of at-risk pregnancies,

101
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:05,548
- saving premature babies.
- Ohh.

102
00:04:05,634 --> 00:04:07,433
And he's a long way
from human trials.

103
00:04:07,518 --> 00:04:10,473
And are you sure it's good
to go down this road?

104
00:04:10,558 --> 00:04:12,933
I mean, I'm hearing things
about this Dr. DeLuca

105
00:04:13,018 --> 00:04:14,973
having a history
of mental illness...

106
00:04:15,058 --> 00:04:16,553
We should discriminate
against people for that?

107
00:04:16,638 --> 00:04:17,830
Of course not.

108
00:04:17,931 --> 00:04:19,103
But we should ask questions

109
00:04:19,188 --> 00:04:20,803
when they start putting babies
in bags.

110
00:04:20,888 --> 00:04:22,683
Bailey, my mom came out
here by herself.

111
00:04:22,768 --> 00:04:24,183
She's been in my apartment
for over a week...

112
00:04:24,268 --> 00:04:27,103
No routine, no being chained
to a library desk.

113
00:04:27,188 --> 00:04:29,553
And even if Dr. DeLuca does
suffer from mental illness,

114
00:04:29,638 --> 00:04:31,053
we need to support people...

115
00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:32,263

175
00:06:58,197 --> 00:06:59,303
Yeah, I'm not.

176
00:06:59,388 --> 00:07:01,462
I mean, I'm interested,

177
00:07:01,626 --> 00:07:05,001
ever since that day
with the mass overdose.

178
00:07:05,228 --> 00:07:06,470
Yeah. Tough day.

179
00:07:06,556 --> 00:07:07,908
Yes.

180
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:11,626
I cried at you,
convulsively.

181
00:07:11,891 --> 00:07:13,306
You might recall.

182
00:07:13,478 --> 00:07:15,634
I haven't seen you around
much since then.

183
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,095
Yeah, that was intentional.

184
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:19,343
It's hard to know where
to go after that.

185
00:07:19,642 --> 00:07:22,775
Anyway, I'm, uh, newly into it.
How about you?

186
00:07:22,861 --> 00:07:24,576
Uh, I do, like,
three of these a year, yeah.

187
00:07:24,728 --> 00:07:26,433
I'm giving a lecture.

188
00:07:26,518 --> 00:07:27,876
Wow.

189
00:07:28,055 --> 00:07:29,970
W-When is that?
Tomorrow.

190
00:07:30,056 --> 00:07:34,142
Uh, but right now, I was gonna
hit up this acupuncture demo.

191
00:07:34,268 --> 00:07:35,673
Interested?

192
00:07:35,798 --> 00:07:39,119
Uh, well, I'm headed to this
next-generation NSAIDs panel.

193
00:07:39,205 --> 00:07:42,290
But... no, you know what?
I think I'd rather get poked.

194
00:07:43,611 --> 00:07:45,845
With needles.

195
00:07:46,388 --> 00:07:48,072
Never mind.

196
00:07:48,308 --> 00:07:50,595
I'm gonna keep avoiding you.

197
00:07:51,428 --> 00:07:52,580
Have a nice time.

198
00:07:55,012 --> 00:07:56,053
Okay.

199
00:07:56,138 --> 00:07:57,183
Oh, my God.

200
00:08:03,285 --> 00:08:05,595
Sir, do you have any pain
when I do this? No, I don't.

201
00:08:05,744 --> 00:08:06,939
Great.
C-spine's cleared.

202
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:11,954
You paged?
Left clavicular fracture

203
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,872
and a possible fracture
of the distal humerus.

204
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:15,283
Hey, is my wife okay?

205
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:16,423
She is right next door.

206
00:08:16,509 --> 00:08:17,688
- She's being...
- What about my baby?

207
00:08:17,892 --> 00:08:19,572
- She's...
- Is my baby all right?

208
00:08:21,142 --> 00:08:22,704
They didn't bring a baby in.

209
00:08:22,789 --> 00:08:24,376
Was there a baby in the car?
No, no, my, um...

210
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:27,164
My wife, um, she's...
She's... ow.

211
00:08:27,345 --> 00:08:29,034
She's five months pregnant.

212
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:30,334
Oh.

213
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:32,704
Um, Schmitt, you can start
on these abrasions.

214
00:08:32,822 --> 00:08:35,165
Um, I'm gonna be right back,
okay?

215
00:08:35,251 --> 00:08:36,626
Okay.

216
00:08:36,749 --> 00:08:38,344
I'm doing a central line.

217
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:39,806
Lidocaine.

218
00:08:40,654 --> 00:08:42,533
Hey.
Switch with me.

219
00:08:42,619 --> 00:08:44,697
- What? I'm just about to do...
- She's pregnant.

220
00:08:45,337 --> 00:08:46,744
Five months.

221
00:08:46,829 --> 00:08:49,034
Switch with me,
and you can take the husband.

222
00:08:49,337 --> 00:08:50,502
I'm fine.

223
00:08:50,681 --> 00:08:52,727
Page OB.
She's pregnant.

224
00:08:52,813 --> 00:08:54,454
And get
an ultrasound, please.

225
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:57,867
Okay.

226
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:02,119
Figure out
why the lamb died,

227
00:09:02,205 --> 00:09:03,494
write a report,
and I'll review it.

228
00:09:03,579 --> 00:09:04,923
Look, I'll talk to Papa
about getting you back

229
00:09:05,009 --> 00:09:06,275
on the research project,
all right?

230
00:09:06,361 --> 00:09:08,124
I don't want back
on this project.

231
00:09:08,209 --> 00:09:10,454
Andrea, stop pretending
you don't see it.

232
00:09:10,539 --> 00:09:13,829
These swings... he's up, he's
down, he's funny, he's cruel.

233
00:09:13,915 --> 00:09:15,212
He is bipolar.

234
00:09:15,298 --> 00:09:18,034
He refuses to acknowledge it,
and now you are, too.

235
00:09:18,205 --> 00:09:19,853
I'm being paged
to The Hole.

236
00:09:19,939 --> 00:09:21,994
- The Pit.
- Go.

237
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:24,914
This is an important project,
but my father...

238
00:09:24,999 --> 00:09:26,574
Is the one who
brought it here.

239
00:09:26,705 --> 00:09:29,119
Could ruin it
if you let him.

240
00:09:30,556 --> 00:09:31,908
Is that your take?

241
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,165
Look, he's not easy.
H-He's never been easy.

242
00:09:34,289 --> 00:09:35,704
But neither is my sister,
and she doesn't have

243
00:09:35,789 --> 00:09:37,244
the right degree
to diagnose him.

244
00:09:37,499 --> 00:09:39,244
The two of them, they...
They do this.

245
00:09:39,423 --> 00:09:40,619
Always have.

246
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:42,074
Get me that report.

247
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:44,209
<i>Neuro resident to the ER.</i>

248
00:09:47,289 --> 00:09:48,914
Maggie, you're adopted.

249
00:09:49,032 --> 00:09:50,954
Yeah, I'd heard that.
And good morning.

250
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,103
I know. Sorry, um...

251
00:09:52,189 --> 00:09:53,712
I was just wondering,
did you ever

252
00:09:53,798 --> 00:09:55,074
get your DNA tested?

253
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:56,259
Have you met me?

254
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:57,574
I battered myself
with tests.

255
00:09:57,659 --> 00:09:59,574
I-I wanted to know
everything.

256
00:09:59,659 --> 00:10:01,327
My DNA results.

257
00:10:01,421 --> 00:10:02,693
I don't want
to open them alone,

258
00:10:02,779 --> 00:10:04,163
but I don't want
to open them with Alex

259
00:10:04,249 --> 00:10:05,124
and have to watch his face

260
00:10:05,209 --> 00:10:07,342
if he discovers that his wife
is a genetic lemon.

261
00:10:07,428 --> 00:10:09,834
I'm your girl.
Look, I know this can be scary.

262
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:11,284
But I promise,
whatever we find...

263
00:10:11,369 --> 00:10:13,334
Ugh, what stinks in here?

264
00:10:13,419 --> 00:10:15,534
That's me, sorry.
I washed my hands, but...

265
00:10:16,709 --> 00:10:18,124
All right, you ready?

266
00:10:18,209 --> 00:10:19,574
Mm-hmm.

267
00:10:22,764 --> 00:10:25,069
Alzheimer's, no.

268
00:10:25,608 --> 00:10:27,592
- Okay.
- Huntington's, no.

269
00:10:27,717 --> 00:10:29,624
Parkinson's, no.

270
00:10:29,858 --> 00:10:32,577
Congratulations.
You won the genetic lottery.

271
00:10:33,898 --> 00:10:36,444
It says here
I'm mostly British.

272
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:37,608
Congrats.

273
00:10:37,694 --> 00:10:38,744
I got a patient.

274
00:10:38,829 --> 00:10:40,494
<i>Dr. Sussman to Peds ICU.</i>

275
00:10:40,579 --> 00:10:41,679
<i>Dr. Sussman to Peds ICU.</i>

276
00:10:41,765 --> 00:10:43,284
Oh, my...

277
00:10:43,369 --> 00:10:47,108
"You are comparing
with Martha Tomlinson."

278
00:10:47,499 --> 00:10:49,672
It's probable that
Martha Tomlinson

279
00:10:49,758 --> 00:10:51,758
"is your first cousin."

280
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,343
I have a cousin.

281
00:10:58,038 --> 00:10:59,952
Do you want me to find her?

282
00:11:00,419 --> 00:11:01,624
How would you do that?

283
00:11:01,709 --> 00:11:03,851
Start with a Web search,
then Facebook, Instagram,

284
00:11:03,937 --> 00:11:05,116
then an exhaustive search

285
00:11:05,202 --> 00:11:06,334
of various consumer
databases...

286
00:11:06,419 --> 00:11:08,116
No, no, no, no!
I don't want that!

287
00:11:08,202 --> 00:11:09,663
No, that's...
that's creepy.

288
00:11:09,749 --> 00:11:10,923
It's all legal.

289
00:11:11,009 --> 00:11:12,179
No.

290
00:11:15,289 --> 00:11:16,827
Okay, but
if you could find her,

291
00:11:16,913 --> 00:11:19,328
could you also find out
who she's related to?

292
00:11:19,414 --> 00:11:21,699
Could you find
her mother or...

293
00:11:21,829 --> 00:11:24,034
- Or your mother?
- No!

294
00:11:24,236 --> 00:11:25,882
I didn't say do it.

295
00:11:35,967 --> 00:11:37,170
Oh.

296
00:11:37,829 --> 00:11:38,994
Okay.

297
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,421
Hello again.

298
00:11:42,621 --> 00:11:43,906
You want me to move?

299
00:11:44,022 --> 00:11:46,452
- No, of course not.
- Shhh!

300
00:11:46,647 --> 00:11:48,437
Oh, God.

301
00:11:53,677 --> 00:11:55,319
What does this do?

302
00:11:55,499 --> 00:11:57,968
The frequencies respond

303
00:11:58,077 --> 00:11:59,687
to the energy meridians
and, uh,

304
00:11:59,773 --> 00:12:01,569
- resonate...
- "Energy meridians."

305
00:12:01,866 --> 00:12:03,218
Oh, my God.

306
00:12:03,304 --> 00:12:04,944
Shh!

307
00:12:05,749 --> 00:12:07,077
You're not
supposed to talk.

308
00:12:07,163 --> 00:12:09,733
Yeah, I'm not supposed
to be here.

309
00:12:29,486 --> 00:12:31,021
Free fluid in her abdomen.

310
00:12:31,107 --> 00:12:32,911
Fetal heartbeat is good.

311
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,414
Baby?

312
00:12:34,607 --> 00:12:35,914
Hey, Lizzie.

313
00:12:35,999 --> 00:12:37,122
You with us?

314
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:38,411
I'm Dr. Altman.

315
00:12:38,497 --> 00:12:39,833
You're bleeding
from your abdomen,

316
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:41,404
and I need to find
where it's coming from.

317
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:42,494
My baby's okay?

318
00:12:42,579 --> 00:12:44,240
Your baby's great,
Lizzie.

319
00:12:44,326 --> 00:12:46,997
Strong heartbeat, moving,
no signs of distress.

320
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:49,005
Yes, but...
It was a surprise.

321
00:12:49,341 --> 00:12:51,560
We were gonna wait,
like, five years.

322
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:54,034
We just got married,
but when we found out,

323
00:12:54,119 --> 00:12:56,784
we were just like, "Yay!"

324
00:12:56,869 --> 00:12:58,411
All right, Lizzie.
You sit tight.

325
00:12:58,497 --> 00:13:00,459
Can I talk to you outside
for a minute, please? Yeah.

326
00:13:04,249 --> 00:13:06,044
I know you're seeing
a healthy baby,

327
00:13:06,135 --> 00:13:08,099
but I'm seeing a mother
with a belly full of blood,

328
00:13:08,185 --> 00:13:10,208
and to save her, I might
have to remove her uterus

329
00:13:10,294 --> 00:13:11,615
along with the baby.

330
00:13:11,701 --> 00:13:14,224
The baby's no more
than 21 weeks.

331
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:15,583
- It cannot survive outside...
- I know.

332
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:16,966
And I have to tell her now,

333
00:13:17,052 --> 00:13:18,913
and you just made it so much
harder for her to hear.

334
00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:21,052
So please keep your mouth shut
and check with me

335
00:13:21,138 --> 00:13:23,583
if you need to talk to her
again, all right?

336
00:13:24,193 --> 00:13:25,536
I-I-I'm sorry.

337
00:13:31,053 --> 00:13:33,869
Brazil's been using
tilapia skin to treat burns

338
00:13:33,955 --> 00:13:35,909
for years now...
Decrease the scarring,

339
00:13:35,995 --> 00:13:38,120
costs nothing compared
to standard treatments,

340
00:13:38,206 --> 00:13:40,886
and it just peels away.

341
00:13:41,249 --> 00:13:42,355
Incredible.

342
00:13:42,486 --> 00:13:43,839
My interns stink.

343
00:13:43,925 --> 00:13:45,886
Yeah, and with its restorative
properties...

344
00:13:45,972 --> 00:13:47,374
It smells like high tide.

345
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:48,834
Patients are complaining,

346
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:52,401
and I do not enjoy breathing
through my mouth.

347
00:13:58,966 --> 00:14:00,627
Explain.

348
00:14:00,743 --> 00:14:02,788
It's part of my spray-on
skin research.

349
00:14:02,919 --> 00:14:04,862
He made us skin the fish.

350
00:14:05,758 --> 00:14:08,034
Well, what do you do with
the other parts of the fish?

351
00:14:08,209 --> 00:14:10,198
Oh, that's medical waste.

352
00:14:10,369 --> 00:14:12,292
Well, that's a crime.

353
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:14,644
What... What is it? Uh.

354
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:17,167
Oh, that looks like
tilapia.

355
00:14:17,406 --> 00:14:19,097
Yeah, that's good fish.

356
00:14:19,579 --> 00:14:22,151
Lambs in a bag,
fish skin on people.

357
00:14:22,237 --> 00:14:23,414
I mean, what's next here?

358
00:14:23,499 --> 00:14:25,847
Next is the machines come to
life and take over the world.

359
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:31,127
Never mind.

360
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:35,534
<i>Dr. Gennis to the ER.</i>

361
00:14:35,619 --> 00:14:37,308
<i>Dr. Ed Gennis to the ER.</i>

362
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,847
Mrs. Karev?

363
00:14:38,941 --> 00:14:40,148
Hello.

364
00:14:40,289 --> 00:14:42,433
D... Uh, I'm, uh,
Dr. Miranda Bailey.

365
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:45,386
I was Alex's chief resident
when he first came here.

366
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:48,667
Oh, my gosh. Hi. It's so...
I'm happy to meet you.

367
00:14:48,847 --> 00:14:50,044
Here. Sit, please.

368
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:51,385
Oh, thank you.

369
00:14:54,995 --> 00:14:56,744
Wow. You must be proud,

370
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:59,414
Alex making it all the way
to chief of the hospital.

371
00:14:59,499 --> 00:15:01,164
Mmmmmm.

372
00:15:01,249 --> 00:15:03,230
So, what are you
knitting here?

373
00:15:03,417 --> 00:15:06,792
Well, it was a scarf
that became a sweater,

374
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,292
and then I just kind of
kept going, and now it's...

375
00:15:10,378 --> 00:15:11,409
Oh.
Now it's...

376
00:15:11,495 --> 00:15:14,769
It's maybe a car cover.

377
00:15:16,441 --> 00:15:18,612
Alex said you'd
extended your stay,

378
00:15:18,698 --> 00:15:20,164
so you must be having
a good time.

379
00:15:20,249 --> 00:15:21,878
I don't travel much.

380
00:15:21,964 --> 00:15:26,605
And, uh, I'm glad I did it,
but it's been a lot for me.

381
00:15:27,994 --> 00:15:30,249
I'm a little nervous about
making the trip back.

382
00:15:30,459 --> 00:15:32,214
Oh, I see.
Um, have you told

383
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:33,688
- Alex or...?
- No.

384
00:15:33,812 --> 00:15:37,033
No, they've both been so great,
Jo and Alex.

385
00:15:37,119 --> 00:15:39,540
I-I...
They're just so busy.

386
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:41,946
I'll feel better.
I will.

387
00:15:42,407 --> 00:15:44,696
I'm just so ready
to be home.

388
00:15:52,024 --> 00:15:53,663
Hey. How is she?

389
00:15:53,876 --> 00:15:55,784
Hey. Um...

390
00:15:55,891 --> 00:15:57,441
Stable, for now.

391
00:15:57,527 --> 00:15:58,892
Uh, so, before
the husband wakes up,

392
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:00,079
I just wanted to
get the update.

393
00:16:00,165 --> 00:16:01,532
Their baby is...?

394
00:16:01,618 --> 00:16:02,624
Right where they left it.

395
00:16:02,709 --> 00:16:03,774
What?

396
00:16:03,928 --> 00:16:05,735
Yeah. The CT showed
that the bleed

397
00:16:05,821 --> 00:16:09,149
was coming from the right
uterine artery, so I embolized.

398
00:16:09,319 --> 00:16:11,854
And the baby's blood supply
is coming from the left side.

399
00:16:12,095 --> 00:16:13,470
She seems happy with it.

400
00:16:15,478 --> 00:16:16,978
Teddy, you saved
their baby.

401
00:16:17,064 --> 00:16:18,849
Well, we'll see.

402
00:16:19,305 --> 00:16:21,524
I mean, I hope she
doesn't re-bleed. Mm.

403
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:23,751
- How's the husband?
- Oh, he...

404
00:16:23,837 --> 00:16:26,873
Fractured clavicle, a small
humerus fracture.

405
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:28,188
He's gonna be fine.

406
00:16:29,789 --> 00:16:30,914
Go home. Get sleep.

407
00:16:30,999 --> 00:16:32,142
No, I'm gonna stay
in case.

408
00:16:32,228 --> 00:16:34,290
I-I want to make sure
all three leave together.

409
00:16:34,376 --> 00:16:36,626
I'll do that.
I'll stay.

410
00:16:36,728 --> 00:16:38,071
No.

411
00:16:38,619 --> 00:16:41,244
You need to get sleep,
and the baby needs sleep.

412
00:16:41,329 --> 00:16:45,681
So, go and... I don't know...
Have Koracick rub your feet.

413
00:16:45,767 --> 00:16:46,876
Owen...

414
00:16:46,962 --> 00:16:48,534
She's my patient.

415
00:16:48,907 --> 00:16:51,414
And Tom is at Hopkins
for the week.

416
00:16:53,298 --> 00:16:55,071
I'll be fine.
I'm just... I'm gonna...

417
00:16:55,173 --> 00:16:56,578
I'm gonna sleep
right here.

418
00:16:57,039 --> 00:16:58,079
Hey.

419
00:16:58,828 --> 00:17:00,172
Go.

420
00:17:06,369 --> 00:17:07,874
Okay.

421
00:17:11,857 --> 00:17:15,012
Well, I mean,
if you're gonna sit there...

422
00:17:15,098 --> 00:17:16,302
Hm?

423
00:17:17,641 --> 00:17:19,016
You could rub my feet.

424
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:23,347
Really?
You brought it up.

Yeah, well, I do work out
my chin pretty hard.

Night.

00:20:00,431 --> 00:20:01,931
Gonna...

484
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:07,252
Teddy. Teddy!

00:20:13,198 --> 00:20:15,073
Teddy. Teddy!

486
00:20:15,159 --> 00:20:16,697
What?

487
00:20:16,783 --> 00:20:18,378
- What is it?
- Her BP bottomed out.

488
00:20:18,464 --> 00:20:19,683
Baby's monitor
is showing decels.

489
00:20:19,769 --> 00:20:20,948
Okay. I'm giving her
two units of blood,

490
00:20:21,034 --> 00:20:22,683
and her pressure
is coming back up.

491
00:20:22,769 --> 00:20:24,191
All right.
Book an OR!

492
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,454
Get ready for...

493
00:20:25,839 --> 00:20:27,089
If I can't stop
the bleeding,

494
00:20:27,175 --> 00:20:28,308
I'm gonna have to take
her uterus out.

495
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:30,105
- Yeah. Do you want me to do it?
- Owen, stop it...

496
00:20:30,191 --> 00:20:31,347
Teddy, I'm not saying
that you can't.

497
00:20:31,433 --> 00:20:32,808
I'm just saying
you don't have to.

498
00:20:32,894 --> 00:20:34,683
I know you feel you should be,
but you don't have to be there

499
00:20:34,769 --> 00:20:35,831
if this woman
loses her baby.

500
00:20:35,917 --> 00:20:37,378
Thank you. I'm okay.

501
00:20:37,464 --> 00:20:39,370
You could get
the father in here

502
00:20:39,456 --> 00:20:41,190
- so we can tell them what's going on.
- Okay.

503
00:20:43,487 --> 00:20:46,386
Add, uh, 1 liter of lactated
Ringer's, please.

504
00:20:46,472 --> 00:20:47,870
Okay.

505
00:20:50,386 --> 00:20:52,874
Your sister
has turned on me.

506
00:20:53,407 --> 00:20:55,409
Papa, nobody's
turned on you, okay?

507
00:20:55,495 --> 00:20:57,511
But you need to learn
how to control your temper.

508
00:20:57,597 --> 00:20:58,808
People are getting
concerned about you,

509
00:20:58,894 --> 00:21:00,058
and I'm trying to
back you up here.

510
00:21:00,144 --> 00:21:02,526
But I can't if you
keep throwing tantrums.

511
00:21:02,644 --> 00:21:05,487
Okay. I'll call her here.
We'll talk like a family.

512
00:21:05,573 --> 00:21:07,151
No, no, no. Papa, no.
Not now.

513
00:21:07,237 --> 00:21:08,894
I just spoke to her.
She needs some time.

514
00:21:08,995 --> 00:21:10,886
Plus, she's got
this pregnant trauma patient

515
00:21:10,972 --> 00:21:13,664
who might lose her baby,
so just let her be.

516
00:21:16,493 --> 00:21:17,993
Why?

517
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,494
Why is she going to
lose this baby?

518
00:21:23,452 --> 00:21:26,002
I'm here. My
embolization didn't work.

519
00:21:26,088 --> 00:21:27,424
The baby is in
severe distress.

520
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:28,791
We have to save
the mother.

521
00:21:28,877 --> 00:21:30,635
I'm gonna go up now,
and I may need your help

522
00:21:30,721 --> 00:21:32,065
to do an emergency
hysterectomy.

523
00:21:32,151 --> 00:21:34,385
- Does she know?
- I just got the husband here,

524
00:21:34,471 --> 00:21:35,760
and I'm gonna tell
them both now.

525
00:21:35,846 --> 00:21:38,229
- I can help.
- Great. Thank you.

526
00:21:38,749 --> 00:21:40,346
But the baby
can't survive yet.

527
00:21:40,432 --> 00:21:43,596
I can keep it safe
and sound outside the mother,

528
00:21:43,682 --> 00:21:46,557
but inside a simulated womb,
where it can develop,

529
00:21:46,643 --> 00:21:48,838
while your wife gets
the care and surgery

530
00:21:48,924 --> 00:21:49,940
she needs to survive.

531
00:21:50,026 --> 00:21:51,454
What's going on?
Papa.

532
00:21:51,539 --> 00:21:53,784
You can save the baby?

533
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:55,761
You can save us both?

534
00:21:55,916 --> 00:21:57,783
Yes, I can.

535
00:22:08,401 --> 00:22:09,697
Morning!

536
00:22:09,994 --> 00:22:11,619
- Sleep well?
- Yeah.

537
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:13,914
Yeah, it was
a good idea to...

538
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:18,334
Sleep is so important
for the, um...

539
00:22:18,419 --> 00:22:20,127
- Brain?
- Sure.

540
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:22,244
When... What...
What are you doing today?

541
00:22:22,432 --> 00:22:24,334
Uh, I was gonna check out
Logan's Nerve Block talk.

542
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:26,229
- Oh, me too.
- Perfect.

543
00:22:26,322 --> 00:22:28,534
Yeah, but when
is your thing?

544
00:22:28,815 --> 00:22:30,705
Uh, you d... you don't
want to go to that.

545
00:22:30,791 --> 00:22:32,276
Of course I do!

546
00:22:32,377 --> 00:22:34,533
But first, coffee.

547
00:22:36,151 --> 00:22:38,697
Which is not in my room.

548
00:22:38,783 --> 00:22:40,416
There's coffee in my room.

549
00:22:41,033 --> 00:22:42,330
Nope!

550
00:22:45,939 --> 00:22:48,330
<i>Dr. Nasraban, 4521</i>.

551
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:51,350
<i>Dr. Ethan Nasraban, 4521.</i>

552
00:22:51,553 --> 00:22:53,104
Grey, you're being creepy.

553
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:54,315
I'm creepy?

554
00:22:54,401 --> 00:22:56,252
They're calling you
the ruler of Atlantis.

555
00:22:56,338 --> 00:22:58,362
Yeah, well, I mean,
it's pretty cool.

556
00:22:58,502 --> 00:23:00,104
Tilapia skin's
rich in collagen,

557
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:01,494
which promotes healing.

558
00:23:01,579 --> 00:23:03,947
No more need for painful
dressing changes.

559
00:23:04,072 --> 00:23:05,408
I'm looking to apply
a lot of those properties

560
00:23:05,494 --> 00:23:06,533
to my spray-on skin.

561
00:23:06,619 --> 00:23:08,690
Ooh, the spray-on skin
is back?

562
00:23:08,776 --> 00:23:11,229
Well, your boyfriend is putting
lambs in zip-lock bags.

563
00:23:11,315 --> 00:23:13,205
He can't be the only one
changing the world, you know?

564
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:14,776
He's not my boyfriend.

565
00:23:14,877 --> 00:23:16,221
Well, that's not
what Maggie said.

566
00:23:16,354 --> 00:23:17,588
Or Richard.

567
00:23:18,619 --> 00:23:21,838
Anyway, I'm not sure how
that project is going.

568
00:23:21,963 --> 00:23:23,334
I have a bad feeling.

569
00:23:23,729 --> 00:23:25,455
Why? Why is that?

570
00:23:25,541 --> 00:23:27,197
Never mind.
I'm just gonna be supportive.

571
00:23:27,283 --> 00:23:29,124
Ah. I get it.

572
00:23:29,549 --> 00:23:31,284
Because he's
your boyfriend.

573
00:23:31,369 --> 00:23:33,963
How is Maggie doing?
Is she nervous about the TV thing?

574
00:23:34,049 --> 00:23:35,454
Well, she put
her makeup on twice,

575
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:38,041
and then they wiped it right off
and then re-applied it, so...

576
00:23:38,127 --> 00:23:39,834
It's going great.

577
00:23:40,096 --> 00:23:41,541
Hey, can he breathe
underwater?

578
00:23:41,627 --> 00:23:43,534
Just keep walking, Grey.

579
00:23:46,127 --> 00:23:47,704
She told you
she's afraid to go home?

580
00:23:47,862 --> 00:23:49,954
But she seems to be doing fine.
And she is.

581
00:23:50,039 --> 00:23:51,682
But, you know,
mental illness

582
00:23:51,768 --> 00:23:54,986
is like cancer and diabetes,
any other chronic illness...

583
00:23:55,072 --> 00:23:56,354
You have to monitor.

584
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,955
Why was she even
telling you this?

585
00:23:58,041 --> 00:23:59,834
I asked her how she was.

586
00:24:00,057 --> 00:24:02,414
Is this some kind of
crusade for you, Bailey? W...

587
00:24:02,499 --> 00:24:05,252
I mean, first going after
Dr. DeLuca, now my mom?

588
00:24:05,338 --> 00:24:07,377
Wh... I'm not "going after"
anyone.

589
00:24:07,463 --> 00:24:08,619
'Cause it seems like
you're prejudiced.

590
00:24:08,705 --> 00:24:09,901
It... What?

591
00:24:09,987 --> 00:24:11,971
Against people
with mental illness.

592
00:24:12,971 --> 00:24:14,791
I'm not prejudiced,
you jackass!

593
00:24:14,877 --> 00:24:16,924
I am a person
with mental illness!

594
00:24:18,249 --> 00:24:20,635
And I cope with it
every day.

595
00:24:20,721 --> 00:24:22,330
I take my medication,
and I'm doing great.

596
00:24:22,416 --> 00:24:24,283
But, sometimes,
I need help.

597
00:24:24,385 --> 00:24:27,119
That's... That's why I asked
you to stay on as chief.

598
00:24:27,205 --> 00:24:29,784
And it's hard to ask
for that help.

599
00:24:29,869 --> 00:24:32,807
Your mother needs to ask,
and she can't.

600
00:24:32,893 --> 00:24:35,374
Your job is to make it
so that she can.

601
00:24:35,837 --> 00:24:37,623
So do your job, son.

602
00:24:37,709 --> 00:24:39,479
Prejudiced.

603
00:24:39,565 --> 00:24:40,799
Jackass.

604
00:24:46,928 --> 00:24:48,378
What the hell?

605
00:24:49,539 --> 00:24:50,954
Tell me what happened.

606
00:24:51,346 --> 00:24:53,080
Last night,
I found Vincenzo DeLuca

607
00:24:53,166 --> 00:24:56,401
counseling my patient to gestate her
premature baby in a bag.

608
00:24:56,487 --> 00:24:58,221
What?
He talked to your patient?

609
00:24:58,307 --> 00:24:59,838
Yeah. He said that
the fetus would be

610
00:24:59,924 --> 00:25:02,424
safe and sound
in an artificial womb.

611
00:25:03,375 --> 00:25:05,033
Listen.
He... He's working on...

612
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:06,877
I transfused multiple times
overnight to buy time,

613
00:25:06,963 --> 00:25:07,908
but I'm just wasting blood.

614
00:25:07,994 --> 00:25:09,252
I'm gonna
have to operate soon.

615
00:25:09,338 --> 00:25:11,322
But, Alex, we can do this?

616
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:15,463
I mean, we can save
my patient's 21-week-old baby?

617
00:25:15,549 --> 00:25:17,539
Can we really
save them both?

618
00:25:19,799 --> 00:25:22,483
Hey.
Have you seen Maggie?

619
00:25:22,708 --> 00:25:23,913
Um, I know.

620
00:25:23,999 --> 00:25:25,834
Is that the woman from
"Good Morning Seattle"?

621
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:28,401
Huh! Yeah, Maggie's very fancy now.
Shh.

622
00:25:28,487 --> 00:25:31,979
Right, uh-huh. I-I... I took
the job here before anyone knew.

623
00:25:32,065 --> 00:25:33,574
And you found a family.

624
00:25:33,659 --> 00:25:35,533
Yeah. I mean, I-I knew that,
uh, my mom

625
00:25:35,619 --> 00:25:37,908
had been here
and she was gone.

626
00:25:37,994 --> 00:25:40,549
But I had no idea
that I had a sister.

627
00:25:40,658 --> 00:25:44,440
And, um, a man who, um...

628
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:49,182
I have a father...
Bill Pierce, who raised me.

629
00:25:49,362 --> 00:25:50,414
Hi, Dad.

630
00:25:50,499 --> 00:25:54,574
Um, but Richard Webber
is, uh, a bonus.

631
00:25:54,659 --> 00:25:56,080
I don't know how else
to describe it.

632
00:25:56,166 --> 00:25:57,454
I'm... I'm...

633
00:25:57,690 --> 00:25:59,033
I'm very lucky.

634
00:25:59,143 --> 00:26:00,994
Sounds like
a pleasant surprise.

635
00:26:01,463 --> 00:26:02,994
It's more than pleasant.

636
00:26:03,221 --> 00:26:04,494
It's life-changing.

637
00:26:04,579 --> 00:26:06,534
Oh, my God. But you missed
that crucial window,

638
00:26:06,619 --> 00:26:08,204
- the chance to meet your mother.
- What?

639
00:26:08,289 --> 00:26:09,971
I did, but...
That's a sign.

640
00:26:10,065 --> 00:26:11,623
I came here to ask her
whether I should

641
00:26:11,709 --> 00:26:13,834
find my birth mother,
and then she's...

642
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:15,534
That is a sign. ...gain
a perspective on her

643
00:26:15,619 --> 00:26:17,374
that no one else got.
What?

644
00:26:17,459 --> 00:26:18,664
Uh, nothing.

645
00:26:18,749 --> 00:26:19,879
- Um.
- <i>Do you think...</i>

646
00:26:19,965 --> 00:26:21,535
What?

647
00:26:22,558 --> 00:26:24,683
I connected with
my father a while back,

648
00:26:24,793 --> 00:26:25,972
and it was not
the best idea.

649
00:26:26,066 --> 00:26:27,980
It didn't alleviate
any of my pain.

650
00:26:28,066 --> 00:26:29,519
It just kind of
created more.

651
00:26:29,652 --> 00:26:31,855
So unless there's some big
answer that you're looking for,

652
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:33,808
you might just want
to let it go.

653
00:26:34,209 --> 00:26:35,886
<i>My point was,
I was... I was raised by...</i>

654
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:37,410
You took my sign down.

655
00:26:37,496 --> 00:26:39,308
<i>Wonderful parents
who encouraged me</i>

656
00:26:39,394 --> 00:26:41,113
<i>to go for everything
I wanted.</i>

657
00:26:41,199 --> 00:26:43,160
<i>When we come back,
we're making wraps..</i>.

658
00:26:43,246 --> 00:26:46,051
<i>The sandwich solution that
brightens your kid's lunch box.</i>

659
00:26:47,066 --> 00:26:48,144
No, no, no.

660
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:50,123
Papa, why were you
even in there?

661
00:26:50,209 --> 00:26:53,644
Papa.
<i>Speaking Italian..</i>.

662
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:57,284
<i>Speaking Italian...</i>

663
00:26:57,369 --> 00:27:00,074
-  <i>Speaking Italian...</i>
- Dr. DeLuca, you can't promise

664
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,838
fake procedures
with my patients.

665
00:27:01,924 --> 00:27:03,160
Please.

666
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:05,777
Tell me something you try
that could work.

667
00:27:05,863 --> 00:27:07,480
I have a living subject.

668
00:27:07,566 --> 00:27:10,191
And a dead one...
Just last night!

669
00:27:10,355 --> 00:27:13,230
P-Papa, you are reckless!
You are thoughtless!

670
00:27:13,316 --> 00:27:15,183
- You just... You just...
- All right, right now, we have a mess

671
00:27:15,269 --> 00:27:17,483
to clean up with this patient.
And you're gonna help.

672
00:27:19,144 --> 00:27:21,128
No, no, no, no.
You stay here.

673
00:27:21,324 --> 00:27:22,499
I mean it.

674
00:27:24,066 --> 00:27:25,129
You've done enough.

675
00:27:34,869 --> 00:27:36,580
I have to take you
up to surgery now,

676
00:27:36,666 --> 00:27:40,400
and I will most likely
have to do a hysterectomy.

677
00:27:42,289 --> 00:27:44,624
Wait. N-No.

678
00:27:44,798 --> 00:27:48,580
That doctor... he said
he could save the baby.

679
00:27:48,736 --> 00:27:50,790
The procedure he told you about
is not yet available.

680
00:27:50,876 --> 00:27:52,134
But he said it was.

681
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:53,439
He said he could do it.

682
00:27:53,548 --> 00:27:55,744
It... It hasn't been
tested in people.

683
00:27:55,829 --> 00:27:57,944
We don't have approval to try
this procedure on your baby.

684
00:27:58,030 --> 00:27:59,530
I-I approve.

685
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:05,587
I'm the mother.
I give you approval.

686
00:28:07,126 --> 00:28:08,807
Do it.

687
00:28:08,954 --> 00:28:10,564
Try it!

688
00:28:12,986 --> 00:28:14,074
I-I can't.

689
00:28:14,251 --> 00:28:18,814
You'll just... let our baby die?

690
00:28:19,689 --> 00:28:21,069
I'm sorry.

691
00:28:27,017 --> 00:28:30,392
Um, is there any chance,
any chance at all?

692
00:28:32,709 --> 00:28:34,384
I'll deliver your baby

693
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:36,478
and make sure
the baby is comfortable

694
00:28:36,572 --> 00:28:38,634
for as long as I can.

695
00:28:39,539 --> 00:28:43,697
And... And, uh,
you can... hold her.

696
00:28:53,164 --> 00:28:54,611
This is Jason.

697
00:28:54,705 --> 00:28:57,645
In 2014, Jason
was a junior and goalie

698
00:28:57,731 --> 00:28:59,041
in high school and club soccer.

699
00:28:59,127 --> 00:29:00,667
Scholarship material.

700
00:29:01,941 --> 00:29:04,316
Protecting the goal got
him a patellar fracture,

701
00:29:04,401 --> 00:29:07,478
comminuted tibial plateau,
torn meniscus, ACL.

702
00:29:07,564 --> 00:29:10,345
Still, he got the team
to the state finals.

703
00:29:10,572 --> 00:29:12,146
He required multiple surgeries,

704
00:29:12,231 --> 00:29:15,306
all of which went well,
had intense P.T. sessions,

705
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:18,916
and I prescribed him
opioids for the pain.

706
00:29:22,481 --> 00:29:24,939
When Jason died
two years later

707
00:29:25,025 --> 00:29:26,439
in a car accident
under the influence,

708
00:29:26,525 --> 00:29:29,646
I realized that
he was a drug addict.

709
00:29:29,731 --> 00:29:32,582
And I had been his first dealer.

710
00:29:33,422 --> 00:29:35,330
But here's my real point.

711
00:29:35,478 --> 00:29:37,462
If I had to do it
all over again,

712
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:39,515
I would've made
the same decision.

713
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,220
Ah...
Let me tell you why.

714
00:29:46,731 --> 00:29:50,712
Opioids are undeniably
a very effective way

715
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:52,798
of fooling the body into
thinking everything is okay.

716
00:30:05,716 --> 00:30:07,396
Are you
going to intubate?

717
00:30:07,763 --> 00:30:08,766
No.

718
00:30:09,133 --> 00:30:10,388
That would just be cruel.

719
00:30:10,474 --> 00:30:11,316
Heaney clamp.

720
00:30:11,401 --> 00:30:12,567
- Pull back.
- Mm-hmm.

721
00:30:12,653 --> 00:30:14,556
- Get that.
- Yeah. Here?

722
00:30:14,641 --> 00:30:15,816
Yep.

723
00:30:18,302 --> 00:30:19,396
Okay.

724
00:30:19,482 --> 00:30:20,950
- I got it.
- Okay.

725
00:30:21,036 --> 00:30:22,411
0-vicryl pop-off.

726
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:31,927
What did you think
you were doing?

727
00:30:32,348 --> 00:30:33,396
You know...

728
00:30:33,506 --> 00:30:34,631
I mean,
you must know...

729
00:30:34,724 --> 00:30:36,396
That you couldn't
try it on their baby.

730
00:30:36,481 --> 00:30:38,692
Why would you give them
false hope like that?

731
00:30:39,927 --> 00:30:42,560
We have the tools
right there.

732
00:30:42,646 --> 00:30:44,583
I could've saved
a person's life...

733
00:30:44,669 --> 00:30:46,833
Not yet!
It's not ready.

734
00:30:46,919 --> 00:30:48,411
We don't know if
the baby would survive,

735
00:30:48,497 --> 00:30:50,770
how the baby would survive,
if... if the brain

736
00:30:50,856 --> 00:30:53,200
- would have deficits...
- Oh, porca miseria, stop.

737
00:30:53,286 --> 00:30:54,481
Stop.

738
00:30:54,567 --> 00:30:57,653
You sound just like
the rest of them.

739
00:30:59,371 --> 00:31:00,935
Oh, my God.

740
00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:03,333
This is it.

741
00:31:04,224 --> 00:31:06,266
This is just like
it was that night.

742
00:31:06,639 --> 00:31:07,981
What night?

743
00:31:08,997 --> 00:31:10,513
Andrea, what night?

744
00:31:10,599 --> 00:31:11,575
What do you mean
"what night"?

745
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:13,516
The night
four people died, Papa!

746
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:16,755
It is
just like that night.

747
00:31:16,841 --> 00:31:18,958
Seven people
come in mangled.

748
00:31:19,044 --> 00:31:20,724
- I am the only one there.
- No, no, no, no.

749
00:31:20,810 --> 00:31:22,481
People came,
people offered to help,

750
00:31:22,567 --> 00:31:23,513
and you wouldn't let them.

751
00:31:23,599 --> 00:31:25,466
I was doing the job
that needed to be done!

752

753

Look, I believe
in your research. I do.

791
00:34:01,905 --> 00:34:03,241
But what happened
with this patient

792
00:34:03,327 --> 00:34:04,491
was a major breach
of protocol.

793
00:34:04,577 --> 00:34:05,862
I can't have that.
So I've decided...

794
00:34:05,948 --> 00:34:08,660
You need to reconsider right now
what you're about to say.

795
00:34:08,746 --> 00:34:10,936
- Papa, don't argue.
- Do not interrupt me.

796
00:34:11,021 --> 00:34:13,186
Papa, you need to get help
before somebody gets hurt.

797
00:34:13,356 --> 00:34:15,098
Like that baby?

798
00:34:16,521 --> 00:34:19,316
I might have saved
that baby.

799
00:34:19,488 --> 00:34:23,146
But you let it die,
and you let it die,

800
00:34:23,317 --> 00:34:25,551
and you let it die!

801
00:34:25,854 --> 00:34:29,371
Because of your cowardice
and laziness,

802
00:34:29,543 --> 00:34:33,856
you will never know if that
child had to die at your hands.

803
00:34:33,941 --> 00:34:35,551
Damn it!

804
00:34:35,771 --> 00:34:37,488
You're stopping
my research?

805
00:34:37,731 --> 00:34:39,606
That what
you're about to say?

806
00:34:39,848 --> 00:34:42,316
No! You don't get
my research!

807
00:34:42,401 --> 00:34:43,606
You don't deserve it!

808
00:34:43,692 --> 00:34:45,020
I take it and go!

809
00:34:45,106 --> 00:34:46,965
Cretini!

810
00:35:05,487 --> 00:35:07,684
Mmm. This actually
makes it worth it.

811
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:09,231
Mmm.

812
00:35:09,418 --> 00:35:10,551
I thought I read
the text wrong,

813
00:35:10,637 --> 00:35:12,004
but, no, you are hosting
a "fish fry."

814
00:35:12,090 --> 00:35:13,113
Yeah, waste not,
want not.

815
00:35:13,199 --> 00:35:14,801
Hey, grab a plate.

816
00:35:15,021 --> 00:35:17,152
Bailey,
can you do me a favor?

817
00:35:17,691 --> 00:35:19,675
Look,
I need your help now.

818
00:35:20,152 --> 00:35:22,817
Can you take back the
chiefship, just for two days?

819
00:35:22,903 --> 00:35:24,090
I still have
a couple weeks left.

820
00:35:24,176 --> 00:35:26,262
- I'm gonna take them.
- I-It's not a fast-food joint, Karev.

821
00:35:26,348 --> 00:35:28,145
We don't cover shifts
for each other.

822
00:35:28,231 --> 00:35:30,074
I need to fly with my mom
back to Iowa.

823
00:35:30,184 --> 00:35:31,646
I talked to her,
and you were right.

824
00:35:31,731 --> 00:35:34,027
- She needs to get home.
- Did you tell her I talked to you?

825
00:35:34,113 --> 00:35:35,685
Hell, no. I look like
a thoughtful son.

826
00:35:35,771 --> 00:35:37,051
Hm.

827
00:35:38,811 --> 00:35:41,574
I will try to fill
your shoes.

828
00:35:41,772 --> 00:35:44,160
Hey, tell your mother
thank you for the hat.

829
00:35:59,901 --> 00:36:01,207
You missed the good part.

830
00:36:01,293 --> 00:36:02,686
There was a good part?

831
00:36:02,887 --> 00:36:04,936
You know, "error of my ways,"
all that stuff.

832
00:36:05,021 --> 00:36:06,646
I will see you in Seattle.

833
00:36:08,481 --> 00:36:10,684
You know, I-I didn't
really have a choice

834
00:36:10,770 --> 00:36:11,936
but to give him
those drugs.

835
00:36:12,082 --> 00:36:14,215
You would've done
the exact same thing I did.

836
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:17,387
I absolutely
would not have,

837
00:36:17,473 --> 00:36:18,973
because I understand
how addiction

838
00:36:19,058 --> 00:36:20,011
-  works.
- Back then, you would've.

839
00:36:20,097 --> 00:36:21,371
And
I believe the drug companies

840
00:36:21,457 --> 00:36:22,738
also understand it,

841
00:36:22,824 --> 00:36:24,646
and they have made billions
on the back of it.

842
00:36:24,731 --> 00:36:27,488
Jason's leg was caught between
a defender and a goalpost.

843
00:36:27,574 --> 00:36:30,106
His knee was bent
90 degrees sideways.

844
00:36:30,191 --> 00:36:33,106
No amount of ibuprofen or sound
baths were gonna help him.

845
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:36,186
- He was talking about suicide.
- Yeah, and you gave him the means!

846
00:36:36,394 --> 00:36:37,801
And you would do it again.
You said you...

847
00:36:37,887 --> 00:36:39,965
Not the same way,
not blindly.

848
00:36:44,691 --> 00:36:48,646
Amelia, science
has given us a way

849
00:36:48,731 --> 00:36:51,559
to tell the brain
to stop unbearable pain.

850
00:36:51,645 --> 00:36:52,606
So far, there's no

851
00:36:52,692 --> 00:36:53,754
-  alternative as effect...
- Are you just giving me

852
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,928
your lecture now?
A child is dead!

853
00:36:56,014 --> 00:36:57,474
You failed him!

854
00:36:59,101 --> 00:37:00,301
And you think
I haven't felt that

855
00:37:00,387 --> 00:37:02,356
every day
since Jason's funeral?

856
00:37:03,613 --> 00:37:07,684
When I saw the look on his
mother's face, I left medicine.

857
00:37:08,515 --> 00:37:11,055
For a year, I only trusted
myself to fix bikes.

858
00:37:11,141 --> 00:37:12,266
I quit.

859
00:37:12,351 --> 00:37:13,879
But, then, I got mad.

860
00:37:13,965 --> 00:37:16,605
Because, yeah, I failed,
the same way we've all failed.

861
00:37:16,691 --> 00:37:19,418
We blew the first rule...
Do no harm.

862
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,785
But he needed those drugs
immediately post-op,

863
00:37:22,871 --> 00:37:23,863
and that's where
it should've stopped.

864
00:37:23,949 --> 00:37:25,686
I should've warned him
and his mother

865
00:37:25,771 --> 00:37:27,129
about the dangers
of dependency.

866
00:37:27,215 --> 00:37:28,871
I-I should've followed up
with his GP.

867
00:37:28,965 --> 00:37:30,300
The system is broken,

868
00:37:30,386 --> 00:37:32,966
and I'm doing everything I can
to try to fix it.

869
00:37:36,601 --> 00:37:39,074
So you're saying
I missed the good part.

870
00:37:46,613 --> 00:37:48,606
I'm trying to
make it right for Jason.

871
00:37:48,691 --> 00:37:50,496
You're trying to make
it right for Betty.

872
00:37:51,096 --> 00:37:52,798
Maybe we don't
have to fight about this.

873
00:37:52,892 --> 00:37:54,213
M-Maybe we could fight
this thing together,

874
00:37:54,299 --> 00:37:55,830
like Batman and...

875
00:37:58,136 --> 00:37:59,650
Batman.

876
00:38:05,596 --> 00:38:07,056
Okay.

877
00:38:07,172 --> 00:38:08,619
You still want
to hit me?

878
00:38:09,731 --> 00:38:11,018
No. Because, for a minute there,

879
00:38:11,104 --> 00:38:12,106
it looked like
you wanted to hit me.

880
00:38:12,191 --> 00:38:14,400
I got a bit of a hair trigger.
It can be scary.

881
00:38:16,114 --> 00:38:21,174
I'm sorry. I've... been in
a weird place these days.

882
00:38:21,992 --> 00:38:23,832
Well, I can roll
with weird.

883
00:38:25,893 --> 00:38:27,436
Want to get some dinner?

884
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:28,850
Yeah.

00:38:32,338 --> 00:38:33,476
No.

<i>"Just because you can
doesn't mean you should."</i>

887
00:38:40,588 --> 00:38:43,316
It's the kind of advice
a mother gives a kid.

888
00:38:43,401 --> 00:38:48,976
I... I feel like I'm...
like I'm taking advantage.

889
00:38:49,248 --> 00:38:50,503
Why?

890
00:38:50,671 --> 00:38:52,146
Because
you're in a "place."

891
00:38:52,231 --> 00:38:55,396
And I think you're insanely pretty.
