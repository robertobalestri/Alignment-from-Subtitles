tomorrow morning for presents?

25
00:01:18,711 --> 00:01:21,130
You know, Owen and I are trying
to establish our own traditions

26
00:01:21,219 --> 00:01:23,305
with Leo, just give him
a little bit of normalcy

27
00:01:23,391 --> 00:01:24,602
- while we still can.
- Right.

28
00:01:24,688 --> 00:01:27,070
Before his mother/sister
comes home from rehab?

29
00:01:27,156 --> 00:01:29,211
And his half-sibling arrives, yeah.

30
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:30,766
Well, kids can make
anything normal,

31
00:01:30,855 --> 00:01:33,055
- so he'll be fine.
- Thanks.

32
00:01:33,219 --> 00:01:34,450
Dr. Grey?

33
00:01:34,609 --> 00:01:37,458
Uh, I start my ICU rotation
tomorrow,

34
00:01:37,547 --> 00:01:41,141
and I was wondering
if you have any advice on... that.

35
00:01:42,109 --> 00:01:44,086
Well, first of all, Schmitt,
don't call them "that."

36
00:01:44,203 --> 00:01:47,247
Sorry, I just mean,
it's so... emotional in there.

37
00:01:47,336 --> 00:01:50,145
Well, it's the ICU,
and she's been here for a month.

38
00:01:50,234 --> 00:01:51,606
She's off the sedatives now.

39
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:53,013
We don't know
when she'll wake up

40
00:01:53,102 --> 00:01:54,891
or even if she'll wake up.

41
00:01:55,054 --> 00:01:57,364
You know, it's brutal,
and it's depressing.

42
00:01:57,453 --> 00:02:00,062
And it can make you feel like
you're going insane.

43
00:02:00,484 --> 00:02:01,497
Right.

44
00:02:01,586 --> 00:02:02,977
So, I...

45
00:02:03,065 --> 00:02:07,297
You are going to watch
Natasha very closely.

46
00:02:07,492 --> 00:02:09,059
You will examine her
every day.

47
00:02:09,148 --> 00:02:11,653
If there's any change,
<i>any</i> type of change,

48
00:02:11,742 --> 00:02:13,375
you'll page me immediately.

49
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:14,805
- Okay?
- Okay.

50
00:02:17,113 --> 00:02:19,028
And you should go outside
on your breaks,

51
00:02:19,117 --> 00:02:20,492
because you can feel like
you're losing

52
00:02:20,602 --> 00:02:22,352
all sense of time in here.

53
00:02:26,727 --> 00:02:28,278
- You had the husband?
- Yeah.

54
00:02:28,367 --> 00:02:30,013
Ice skate to the tibia.
You?

55
00:02:30,102 --> 00:02:32,141
Ouch. Wife had
a hell of a concussion.

56
00:02:32,266 --> 00:02:34,344
Most wonderful time
of the year, right?

57
00:02:35,131 --> 00:02:36,531
Hey.

58
00:02:37,025 --> 00:02:38,338
It's snowing.

59
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:46,227
What are you guys doing for Christmas?

60
00:02:46,437 --> 00:02:49,484
Oh, you know, Leo's too young
to absorb any of it.

61
00:02:49,573 --> 00:02:52,606
But, I think we're gonna
do presents and cocoa

62
00:02:52,695 --> 00:02:54,184
and cinnamon buns,
all that.

63
00:02:54,273 --> 00:02:55,442
Hopefully some of it'll stick.

64
00:02:55,531 --> 00:02:56,567
Yeah, that's sweet.

65
00:02:56,656 --> 00:02:59,453
And Amelia has to go to rehab
to visit Betty. Yeah.

66
00:02:59,672 --> 00:03:01,224
Right. The usual.

67
00:03:01,313 --> 00:03:02,547
Ha. Yeah.

68
00:03:05,139 --> 00:03:07,538
So, we're gonna, um...

69
00:03:08,038 --> 00:03:10,083
We're having Christmas dinner
tomorrow night,

70
00:03:10,172 --> 00:03:13,247
and Amelia wanted me
to invite you.

71
00:03:13,422 --> 00:03:16,049
Oh, no, no. Thanks. No.

72
00:03:16,137 --> 00:03:18,195
I'm... I'm covering for you
in the pit, remember?

73
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:19,523
Oh, right, right. Yeah.

74
00:03:19,695 --> 00:03:20,902
Of course.
And thank you, again.

75
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:22,352
Yeah, of course.

76
00:03:32,237 --> 00:03:34,674
We're gonna find
our own traditions, too.

77
00:03:35,824 --> 00:03:37,089
I know.

78
00:03:39,827 --> 00:03:41,877
Merry Christmas, Owen.

79
00:03:53,085 --> 00:03:54,312
It's a unique choice.

80
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:56,179
I mean, I don't think
we've ever had a chief

81
00:03:56,268 --> 00:03:57,851
give us cured meat before.

82
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,604
I did something nice,
and you're mocking me

83
00:03:59,693 --> 00:04:00,960
- for it.
- Oh, wait! Did you tell her?

84
00:04:01,049 --> 00:04:02,382
We're having
a New Year's Eve party.

85
00:04:02,471 --> 00:04:04,444
Attending and fellows
only. Champagne.

86
00:04:04,533 --> 00:04:06,343
Little snacky things
on crackers.

87
00:04:06,432 --> 00:04:08,140
- Very classy.
- How glamorous.

88
00:04:08,229 --> 00:04:09,969
I know.
You should invite Link.

89
00:04:10,057 --> 00:04:11,101
I mean,
I already invited him,

90
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,866
but y-you should ask him to be your date,

91
00:04:12,955 --> 00:04:14,374
'cause I already told him
that you would.

92
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:17,190
- Jo...
- Ooh, sorry. Ohh! Oh, my...

93
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,556
- Oh.
- Hey.

94
00:04:18,644 --> 00:04:21,202
Hi. Um, I-I was just leaving,

95
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:22,515
and it looks like you are, too.

96
00:04:22,604 --> 00:04:24,143
Do you want to take
our hams out

97
00:04:24,232 --> 00:04:26,229
- for a drink?
- Oh, that sounds amazing,

98
00:04:26,318 --> 00:04:28,414
but I have to get home
because it's Christmas Eve.

99
00:04:28,503 --> 00:04:30,366
I have to put the kids to bed
so Santa can come.

100
00:04:30,455 --> 00:04:31,335
- Right.
- Yeah.

101
00:04:31,424 --> 00:04:33,627
- Soon though?
- Yes. Yeah.

102
00:04:34,146 --> 00:04:36,319
Oh, you know, actually,
the Karevs are having

103
00:04:36,408 --> 00:04:39,054
a very classy
New Year's Eve party.

104
00:04:39,143 --> 00:04:40,764
- I'll be there.
- Okay. - No...

105
00:04:40,853 --> 00:04:42,100
..Dark blue scrubs only.

106
00:04:42,189 --> 00:04:43,451
She can have a plus one.

107
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:45,959
- You're supposed to read my tone.
- Read your what? - Jo,

108
00:04:46,048 --> 00:04:47,373
I'm a big girl.

109
00:04:47,462 --> 00:04:49,131
I can handle
my own love life.

110
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:51,233
- Thanks for the ham, Chief.
- You're welcome.

111
00:04:51,322 --> 00:04:52,678
Here comes Santa Claus.

112
00:04:52,767 --> 00:04:54,233
This is for you.

113
00:04:54,322 --> 00:04:56,756
Cookies for Santa, in case you
don't feel like baking later.

114
00:04:56,845 --> 00:04:58,654
Link is spending
his Christmas Eve

115
00:04:58,743 --> 00:05:00,580
visiting kids
in the cancer ward.

116
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:02,803
Seriously?

117
00:05:02,892 --> 00:05:04,701
- Seriously.
- Seriously.

118
00:05:04,789 --> 00:05:06,937
You're mocking him
for doing something even nicer.

119
00:05:07,025 --> 00:05:08,517
You should
take a look at that.

120
00:05:08,611 --> 00:05:09,915
We'll see you New Year's Eve.

121
00:05:10,004 --> 00:05:11,353
Bye, Santa.

122
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:13,366
You are
in a love triangle.

123
00:05:13,673 --> 00:05:15,445
There's no love.
There's no triangle.

124
00:05:15,548 --> 00:05:16,688
Yeah.

125
00:05:17,493 --> 00:05:20,326
Unless, of course, the ham, the
cookies, and I are a triangle.

126
00:05:21,372 --> 00:05:23,157
She's totally
in a love triangle.

127
00:05:23,246 --> 00:05:24,454
Mm-hmm.

128
00:05:28,342 --> 00:05:29,424
Hey.

129
00:05:29,513 --> 00:05:30,988
- Uh, sorry I didn't call first.
- Hey.

130
00:05:31,077 --> 00:05:32,728
Oh, it's okay. Come in.

131
00:05:32,816 --> 00:05:34,019
Uh, I can't stay.

132
00:05:34,108 --> 00:05:35,898
Just, uh... just wanted
to drop these off for Tuck

133
00:05:35,986 --> 00:05:38,036
for in the morning from me.

134
00:05:38,355 --> 00:05:40,083
Oh. Thank you.

135
00:05:40,172 --> 00:05:42,853
Uh... Uh, but I put your name
on all the gifts I got him.

136
00:05:42,993 --> 00:05:44,107
Why would you do that?

137
00:05:44,195 --> 00:05:45,608
Well, 'cause
they're from us.

138
00:05:45,696 --> 00:05:46,886
It's funny.

139
00:05:46,974 --> 00:05:48,944
I-I don't remember us
going shopping together.

140
00:05:49,106 --> 00:05:51,347
I just didn't want him
to think that...

141
00:05:51,435 --> 00:05:52,927
You called a time-out on our marriage?

142
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:55,150
Okay. I'm sorry.

143
00:05:55,239 --> 00:05:57,080
Uh, thank you
for the gifts.

144
00:05:57,169 --> 00:05:59,736
I'll make sure that
he opens them.

145
00:05:59,825 --> 00:06:03,158
Uh, what are you... Wait.
Where are you gonna be tomorrow?

146
00:06:03,246 --> 00:06:05,137
On call. You know,
Christmas is a big day for us.

147
00:06:05,225 --> 00:06:06,261
Oh, us, too.

148
00:06:06,349 --> 00:06:07,362
Uh, maybe I'll see you in the pit.

149
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,765
Maybe don't sound so hopeful
that somebody gets injured

150
00:06:09,853 --> 00:06:11,403

151
00:06:11,722 --> 00:06:12,733

consciousness overnight.

199
00:08:29,323 --> 00:08:31,065
She is now A&O times three.

200
00:08:31,167 --> 00:08:32,698
Cardio and pulmonary...
She's on a vent

201
00:08:32,784 --> 00:08:35,565
and has an open thoracostomy
for empyema drainage.

202
00:08:35,651 --> 00:08:37,665
MSK... Spine was cleared,

203
00:08:37,815 --> 00:08:40,065
and her pelvis was fixed
internally.

204
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,205
When will she
be able to talk?

205
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:43,557
We're working on decreasing
her vent settings first.

206
00:08:43,643 --> 00:08:45,018
We also have
to get her nutrition up.

207
00:08:45,104 --> 00:08:47,285
She's weak and has been
through quite a lot.

208
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:49,112
We can close the
thoracostomy today, though,

209
00:08:49,198 --> 00:08:50,729
since her lungs
are doing so much better.

210
00:08:50,815 --> 00:08:52,432
Natasha, we need you
to get strong for us.

211
00:08:52,518 --> 00:08:54,729
I'm gonna get you up and out
of that bed soon, okay?

212

the respiratory therapist

213
00:08:56,628 --> 00:08:58,339

00:14:49,716 --> 00:14:51,653
Neuro and cardio unchanged.

351
00:14:51,739 --> 00:14:54,387
Pulmonary... She has tolerated
her speaking valve trials

352
00:14:54,473 --> 00:14:56,137
with intermittent oxygen.

353
00:14:56,223 --> 00:14:58,075
We will remove
the chest tube today.

354
00:14:58,215 --> 00:15:00,184
GI... She's on tube feeds.

355
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:02,875
PT/OT...
She made it bed to chair.

356
00:15:02,997 --> 00:15:06,286
Well, there has been
a lot of progress.

357
00:15:06,598 --> 00:15:08,075
We're still not out
of the woods yet,

358
00:15:08,161 --> 00:15:11,205
but, um, do you have any
questions for us?

359
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,315
When do I get to eat?

360
00:15:14,106 --> 00:15:15,872
She's been awake for 11 days,
and she's been asking

361
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:17,677
about tacos for 10 of them.

362
00:15:18,003 --> 00:15:20,168
Tacos are a ways away,
I'm afraid.

363
00:15:20,261 --> 00:15:22,153
But we can...
We can do Jell-O.

364
00:15:22,239 --> 00:15:24,302
The speech and swallow therapist
will try that today.

365
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:25,543
I'll take it.

366
00:15:25,628 --> 00:15:27,145
Uh, watermelon.

367
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:28,692
Okay,
you take care.

368
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:32,809
Hey.
Dr. Grey.

369
00:15:32,895 --> 00:15:34,252
I haven't seen you
in a few days.

370
00:15:34,338 --> 00:15:35,582
- How have you been?
- Stood up.

371
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:36,699
Sorry.

372
00:15:36,785 --> 00:15:38,377
I don't know if you've
ever been stood up before,

373
00:15:38,463 --> 00:15:39,463
but it feels pretty awful.

374
00:15:39,548 --> 00:15:41,684
- Well, I had a patient.
- You have a phone.

375
00:15:42,221 --> 00:15:43,934
<i>Dr. Rainey to Peds ICU.</i>

376
00:15:44,048 --> 00:15:46,309
<i>Dr. Rainey to Peds ICU.</i>

377
00:15:46,485 --> 00:15:47,520
Look, it's been fun.

378
00:15:47,668 --> 00:15:49,173
The waiting.
The build up. The game.

379
00:15:49,258 --> 00:15:50,673
But that?
That wasn't fun.

380
00:15:50,758 --> 00:15:52,123
- That was just rude.
- You're right.

381
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:53,926
I'm a good guy,
Meredith.

382
00:15:54,588 --> 00:15:55,833
But I'm not a doormat.

383
00:15:55,918 --> 00:15:57,083
And if that's what you're after,
then I don't know.

384
00:15:57,168 --> 00:15:58,708
Maybe Link is your guy
after all.

385
00:16:04,449 --> 00:16:06,173
A little more.
A little more!

386
00:16:06,258 --> 00:16:07,965
Good!
There you go!

387
00:16:08,051 --> 00:16:10,016
Please don't talk to me
like I'm a child.

388
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:11,723
It's perfectly normal
to feel...

389
00:16:11,809 --> 00:16:13,354
How do you know
what "normal" is?

390
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:16,175
Have you ever had
your spine carved open

391
00:16:16,261 --> 00:16:17,387
and dug around in?

392
00:16:17,473 --> 00:16:18,528
Huh?

393
00:16:18,614 --> 00:16:21,192
Um... Marsha,

394
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:23,442
can you give us a minute,
please?

395
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:25,416
Yeah.
Thank you.

396
00:16:27,978 --> 00:16:30,481
Richard, spare me the lecture
about recovery.

397
00:16:30,567 --> 00:16:32,145
- I know that's the pain talking.
- No,

398
00:16:32,231 --> 00:16:35,042
that is me talking,
and I say she's a pain.

399
00:16:35,128 --> 00:16:37,067
You're a pain
in my entire ass!

400
00:16:38,129 --> 00:16:39,637
I asked her to give me
some exercises

401
00:16:39,723 --> 00:16:43,178
so that I could get back
to my sensual self,

402
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:44,785
and she said
"Don't worry

403
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:46,213
your little heart
about that"

404
00:16:46,298 --> 00:16:48,262
like
I'm some dried-up old mop.

405
00:16:48,355 --> 00:16:49,817
Well, I'm sure that's
not what she meant.

406
00:16:49,917 --> 00:16:51,582
Then what did she mean?

407
00:16:51,668 --> 00:16:53,059
It's not like
these pain meds

408
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:55,426
are letting me have any
sexual appetite anyway.

409
00:16:55,512 --> 00:16:56,793
The average
recovery time...

410
00:16:56,942 --> 00:16:58,098
Since when am I average?

411
00:16:58,184 --> 00:16:59,502
Don't talk to me about time.

412
00:16:59,588 --> 00:17:00,957
Don't help me.

413
00:17:07,473 --> 00:17:09,895
Hey, sorry I'm late.
You already started.

414
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:12,534
This gel is really cold, and I
have to get back to the pit.

415
00:17:12,582 --> 00:17:14,145
You said we were gonna
do these things together.

416
00:17:14,231 --> 00:17:15,566
- You can't just...
- What do you want me to do?

417
00:17:15,652 --> 00:17:17,153
Every time I have to
be a parent, wait for you?

418
00:17:17,239 --> 00:17:18,910
Yeah, but if you say you're gonna
wait, then you can't just...

419
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:21,192
This baby is gonna be outside
of my body eventually.

420
00:17:21,278 --> 00:17:22,668
Oh, really?
Is that how it works?

421
00:17:22,754 --> 00:17:23,973
Please explain it to me,
Teddy.

422
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:26,699
Oh, my God.

423
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:30,998
It's a...
Oh, wow.

424
00:17:34,217 --> 00:17:35,797
We're having a baby girl.

425
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,211
Hey! Ben!

426
00:17:48,297 --> 00:17:50,172
Hey.
Hey.

427
00:17:50,418 --> 00:17:51,543
MVC out on Elliott.

428
00:17:51,628 --> 00:17:53,071
This... This black ice
is no joke.

429
00:17:53,157 --> 00:17:55,383
- Did you put your snow tires on?
- Uh, I will.

430
00:17:55,628 --> 00:17:59,173
Ben, um, I need to
tell you something...

431
00:17:59,258 --> 00:18:00,713
Or ask you something.

432
00:18:00,798 --> 00:18:03,954
I don't have the words ready,
but my heart is.

433
00:18:05,317 --> 00:18:08,032
I want you to come home,
Ben.

434
00:18:08,266 --> 00:18:09,596
Please.

435
00:18:13,221 --> 00:18:17,555
I mean... it's lonely at
the house when Tuck is gone,

436
00:18:17,668 --> 00:18:19,253
and, uh, the fence,
uh, it...

437
00:18:19,338 --> 00:18:20,946
It blew down after
the windstorm.

438
00:18:21,032 --> 00:18:22,641
I haven't had a chance...
No.

439
00:18:22,844 --> 00:18:24,293
Come home, Ben.

440
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:25,516
Please.

441
00:18:25,798 --> 00:18:26,998
Come home.

442
00:18:30,363 --> 00:18:31,946
Miranda, I...

443
00:18:32,302 --> 00:18:33,688
I love you.

444
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:38,188
But you broke my heart.

445
00:18:39,309 --> 00:18:41,874
I'm not coming home just because
now you're lonely

446
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,205
and the fence
needs patching.

447
00:18:44,378 --> 00:18:45,368
Okay.

448
00:18:45,454 --> 00:18:48,079
O-Okay, no, uh,
that's not what I meant.

449
00:18:48,165 --> 00:18:49,500
Uh...

450
00:18:49,611 --> 00:18:51,106
You know I haven't
been myself.

451
00:18:51,418 --> 00:18:53,063
It was my meds.

452
00:18:53,453 --> 00:18:56,649
I was working on
my physical health so much

453
00:18:56,735 --> 00:18:58,375
that I was ignoring
my mental...

454
00:18:58,461 --> 00:19:01,430
My anxieties, again,
they...

455
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:08,055
I-It wasn't the job,
and it was not your fault.

456
00:19:08,548 --> 00:19:10,753
But I'm...
I'm handling it.

457
00:19:10,838 --> 00:19:12,446
I'm... I'm being treated.

458
00:19:12,798 --> 00:19:14,711
I'm better now.

459
00:19:14,855 --> 00:19:16,757
<i>Structure fire
at Mercer and Fairview.</i>

460
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:18,578
<i>All nearby units, respond.</i>

461
00:19:18,757 --> 00:19:20,042
W-We have to go.

462
00:19:20,328 --> 00:19:21,463
I'll talk to you later.

463
00:19:21,548 --> 00:19:22,588
Ben?

464
00:19:26,108 --> 00:19:27,273
I'm sorry.

465
00:19:39,574 --> 00:19:43,122
Natasha Deon, 45,
hospital day 62.

466
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:44,648
Neuro unchanged,

467
00:19:44,744 --> 00:19:46,869
cardio... she was
tachycardic overnight.

468
00:19:46,955 --> 00:19:49,836
Pulmonary... she was placed back
on the ventilator two days ago.

469
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:51,837
She's been awake
for four weeks.

470
00:19:51,932 --> 00:19:53,347
Why is she
back on the ventilator?

471
00:19:53,433 --> 00:19:55,445
She has pneumonia,
so she's on antibiotics,

472
00:19:55,548 --> 00:19:57,875
but her lungs have taken
a pretty big hit.

473
00:19:58,268 --> 00:20:02,183
GI... Her tube feeds
were held for the O.R. today,

474
00:20:02,269 --> 00:20:04,144
but the CT
from overnight...

475
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:07,435
My ostomy.
It's been hurting.

476
00:20:07,535 --> 00:20:09,398
Am I...
Are you still gonna...

477
00:20:09,484 --> 00:20:12,173
We won't be able
to reverse your ostomy today.

478
00:20:12,258 --> 00:20:14,043
What? Why?

479
00:20:14,128 --> 00:20:15,543
The CT
that we got back,

480
00:20:15,628 --> 00:20:18,173
it showed fluid collections
in your abdomen,

481
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:19,484
which may be
the source of your symptoms.

482
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:20,765
- What does that mean?
- It means that

483
00:20:20,851 --> 00:20:22,187
we will do surgery today,

484
00:20:22,338 --> 00:20:24,664
but it will be to clean out
the fluid collections.

485
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,468
So you're gonna
open her back up?

486
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:29,281
The wounds she's been working
to heal for the last few weeks?

487
00:20:29,406 --> 00:20:31,048
Unfortunately, yes.

488
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:35,375
GU... She is
on intermittent dialysis,

489
00:20:35,498 --> 00:20:37,873
and she is going to have
another session today.

490
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:40,413
<i>Heme... she is
on DVT prophylaxis.</i>

491
00:20:47,491 --> 00:20:48,616
Don't judge me.

492
00:20:48,702 --> 00:20:49,890
I saw a bed.
I laid down on it.

493
00:20:49,976 --> 00:20:51,293
My feet are
very angry with me.

494
00:20:51,378 --> 00:20:53,304
Ah.
I know what you need.

495
00:20:53,498 --> 00:20:56,312
And I know
just who to give it to you.

496
00:20:57,088 --> 00:20:59,218
Mimi at Pink Bunny.

497
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:01,108
Best mani-pedi
in Seattle.

498
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:03,122
Why does it make perfect sense

499
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:04,539
that you have
a favorite nail salon?

500
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:06,265
Well, you don't want
to dig around somebody's brain

501
00:21:06,351 --> 00:21:07,265
with sloppy cuticles.

502
00:21:07,351 --> 00:21:09,671
You ever want to experience
pure bliss for $29...

503
00:21:09,757 --> 00:21:11,718
Mnh!...
You let me know.

504
00:21:19,609 --> 00:21:21,083
Okay, cut the knot.

505
00:21:23,721 --> 00:21:26,093
Nicely done.
You can do the next tie.

506
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:28,996
You seem different.

507
00:21:29,168 --> 00:21:30,211
I got contacts.

508
00:21:30,297 --> 00:21:31,802
No, it's...
It's not that.

509
00:21:31,888 --> 00:21:34,013
It's... It's just
you're less...

510
00:21:34,123 --> 00:21:35,523
Glasses.

511
00:21:35,998 --> 00:21:37,390
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

512
00:21:37,476 --> 00:21:38,539
Yeah, and...
And the other day,

513
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:40,830
when I asked you to change
Natasha's central line,

514
00:21:40,998 --> 00:21:42,937
you didn't mess it up
at all.

515
00:21:43,298 --> 00:21:46,640
Kind of a backhanded compliment,
but thank you?

516
00:21:50,088 --> 00:21:52,503
- I met someone.
- Mm.

517
00:21:52,588 --> 00:21:55,289
And he's hot,
and he's confident,

518
00:21:55,375 --> 00:21:56,632
and he likes me.

519
00:21:59,578 --> 00:22:01,203
And I'm gay.

520
00:22:01,836 --> 00:22:02,873
And he's gay.

521
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:06,117
And we're... gay
together.

522
00:22:06,418 --> 00:22:09,312
And it's the most me I've
ever felt in my whole life.

523
00:22:09,897 --> 00:22:11,937
Well, I'm happy for you,
Schmitt.

524
00:22:12,578 --> 00:22:13,718
Thank you.

525
00:22:13,804 --> 00:22:15,629
Yeah,
I think it's beautiful.

526
00:22:16,093 --> 00:22:17,375
After all,
what's life for

527
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:18,984
if not to share it
with somebody, right?

528
00:22:19,125 --> 00:22:21,330
Does that mean
life is not worth living alone?

529
00:22:21,439 --> 00:22:23,042
I think if you meet someone
who lights you up,

530
00:22:23,128 --> 00:22:24,543
you should
fight for them.

531
00:22:24,687 --> 00:22:26,173
Suction.

532
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:30,500
This fluid looks cloudy.

533
00:22:31,931 --> 00:22:33,516
Oh, no.

534
00:22:33,758 --> 00:22:35,265
She's got dead bowel.

535
00:22:35,449 --> 00:22:36,364
Did we know that?

536
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:39,070
No, damn it.
G.I.A. stapler.

537
00:22:39,574 --> 00:22:41,869
<i>Oh, God.
That's really bad, right?</i>

538
00:22:48,338 --> 00:22:50,321
Last time I was here,
she was talking about

539
00:22:50,407 --> 00:22:52,298
someone named "Linus"
a lot.

540
00:22:52,384 --> 00:22:54,782
Is that a... like, a boy?
Does she have a boyfriend?

541
00:22:54,958 --> 00:22:58,079
She didn't
call him that, but I think so.

542
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,844
- Hey.
- Hi!

543
00:23:08,072 --> 00:23:09,165
Was that him?

544
00:23:09,423 --> 00:23:10,571
Who?

545
00:23:10,657 --> 00:23:11,782
"Linus"?

546
00:23:12,088 --> 00:23:13,543
Uh, yeah, I guess.

547
00:23:13,628 --> 00:23:14,852
You guess?

548
00:23:17,258 --> 00:23:19,087
I'm doing
the stupid steps.

549
00:23:19,222 --> 00:23:23,912
Um, and I'm on the one
where you apologize for stuff

550
00:23:23,998 --> 00:23:25,043
and tell the truth.

551
00:23:25,128 --> 00:23:27,423
So, I have something
to tell you guys.

552
00:23:28,743 --> 00:23:30,408
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

553
00:23:30,548 --> 00:23:32,704
I've been lying to you guys
since I met you.

554
00:23:33,208 --> 00:23:34,548
My name's not Betty,

555
00:23:34,634 --> 00:23:36,665
and my parents
don't even know I'm here.

556
00:23:37,658 --> 00:23:39,008
But we've been
calling them.

557
00:23:39,094 --> 00:23:42,055
No, you've been talking
to my friend Jerry.

558
00:23:42,541 --> 00:23:45,251
Um, what's
your real name?

559
00:23:45,338 --> 00:23:46,524
Britney.

560
00:23:47,284 --> 00:23:48,829
I'm sorry.

561
00:23:50,047 --> 00:23:51,582
I know I should've told you,
but I was scared

562
00:23:51,668 --> 00:23:53,173
if they found out
about Leo.

563
00:23:53,258 --> 00:23:54,891
Whoa. Hold on.
They don't know about Leo?

564
00:23:54,977 --> 00:23:56,618
I ran away
when I got pregnant,

565
00:23:56,814 --> 00:23:59,439
and they've probably been
looking for me ever since.

566
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:01,071
Okay. Um, well,

567
00:24:01,157 --> 00:24:02,751
- we have to call them now.
- No.

568
00:24:02,837 --> 00:24:04,180
No, no, no.
You can't.

569
00:24:04,282 --> 00:24:05,571
You can't.

570
00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:07,469
I'm not ready.

571
00:24:08,782 --> 00:24:10,969
And I'm scared
if they know about Leo,

572
00:24:11,055 --> 00:24:12,368
they're gonna take him.

573
00:24:17,262 --> 00:24:21,017
Natasha Deon, 45,
hospital day 73.

574
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:23,087
Neuro... I don't understand
what's happening.

575
00:24:23,365 --> 00:24:25,252
It feels like
every step forward she makes,

576
00:24:25,338 --> 00:24:26,766
she takes
two steps back.

577
00:24:26,894 --> 00:24:28,519
It's February 2nd.

578
00:24:28,719 --> 00:24:30,118
Groundhog Day.

579
00:24:30,204 --> 00:24:31,532
That's me.

580
00:24:31,618 --> 00:24:35,251
I feel like
I keep living the same day...

581
00:24:36,258 --> 00:24:38,413
Over and over.

582
00:24:38,498 --> 00:24:39,923
Okay, Bill Murray.

583
00:24:40,118 --> 00:24:42,227
Let the doctors tell us
what's going on.

584
00:24:43,394 --> 00:24:46,371
The reason we think she had
the dead bowel is that she's...

585
00:24:46,676 --> 00:24:47,770
Natasha?

586
00:24:47,939 --> 00:24:49,854
Okay, she's coding!
I'm gonna start compressions!

587
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:51,355
Crack open the crash cart
and let's push

588
00:24:51,441 --> 00:24:52,726
one of atropine
and one of epi.

589
00:24:52,812 --> 00:24:54,527
Natasha! Schmitt,
get him out of here.

590
00:24:54,613 --> 00:24:56,548
Natasha, please!
I need you!

591
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,493
She probably
threw a PE...

592
00:24:58,579 --> 00:25:01,404
Let's get an echo in here
and start a heparin drip.

593
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,821
Natasha Deon, 45,
hospital day 84.

594
00:25:12,918 --> 00:25:13,963
Overnight,
she continued...

595
00:25:14,048 --> 00:25:17,079
Just tell me.
Please.

596
00:25:17,838 --> 00:25:20,963
Well, when she had her pulmonary
embolism 11 days ago,

597
00:25:21,049 --> 00:25:24,174
it... it... it weakened
her heart and her lungs.

598
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:26,455
And since then, her kidneys
have worsened, as well.

599
00:25:26,541 --> 00:25:27,616
- I'm sorry.
- Why?

600
00:25:27,917 --> 00:25:29,252
Why?

601
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,095
I just... I...
Garrett, I...

602
00:25:32,181 --> 00:25:33,822
Why is this happening to us?

603
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:38,083
- I don't have an answer for that...
- Why is this happening to us?

604
00:25:38,228 --> 00:25:39,939
She was getting better.

605
00:25:40,807 --> 00:25:42,510
After all
we went through.

606
00:25:44,214 --> 00:25:45,455
Natasha...

607
00:25:47,088 --> 00:25:48,123
- Garrett?
- Garrett.

608
00:25:48,208 --> 00:25:49,674
Hey, hey, hey.
Garrett.

609
00:25:49,854 --> 00:25:52,517
If she dies, I die.
If she dies, I die.

610
00:25:52,628 --> 00:25:54,413
- Okay.
- If she dies, I die.

611
00:25:54,498 --> 00:25:55,947
Garrett. Listen to me.
Look at me, please.

612
00:25:56,033 --> 00:25:57,142
Look at me.
Look at me. I'm here.

613
00:25:57,298 --> 00:25:59,413
Look at me, please.
Listen to me.

614
00:25:59,721 --> 00:26:00,746
You won't die.

615
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:03,127
I know it feels like that
right now, but trust me.

616
00:26:03,298 --> 00:26:04,697
You won't die.

617
00:26:05,284 --> 00:26:07,142
You have to fight
for her.

618
00:26:07,228 --> 00:26:09,443
She's in there
fighting for you.

619
00:26:09,798 --> 00:26:11,168
You don't get to give up.

620
00:26:12,813 --> 00:26:16,178
So part of that fight is
you're gonna go take a walk,

621
00:26:16,498 --> 00:26:19,471
you're gonna take a shower,
and you're gonna get a meal.

622
00:26:20,161 --> 00:26:23,822
We will be here,
fighting to keep her alive.

623
00:26:23,908 --> 00:26:29,158
And you are gonna go fight
to keep yourself alive.

624
00:26:29,868 --> 00:26:30,963
Okay?

625
00:26:31,958 --> 00:26:33,373
Come on.

626
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:40,332
<i>♪ They don't love you
like I love you ♪</i>

627
00:26:40,418 --> 00:26:42,111
<i>♪ Wait ♪</i>

628
00:26:42,298 --> 00:26:45,293
<i>♪ They don't love you

629
00:26:45,378 --> 00:26:46,947
<i>♪ Wait ♪</i>

630
00:26:47,114 --> 00:26:50,079

631
00:26:50,165 --> 00:26:53,844
<i>♪ Maps ♪</i>

632
00:26:54,993 --> 00:26:56,372
Oh!

633
00:26:59,753 --> 00:27:01,836
Oh, Catherine.

634
00:27:02,269 --> 00:27:03,729
Oh, honey.

635
00:27:05,346 --> 00:27:07,422
I can't do it!

636
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:10,586
I can't.

637
00:27:10,876 --> 00:27:12,041
No!

638
00:27:13,736 --> 00:27:15,691
<i>I can't...</i>

639
00:27:17,117 --> 00:27:19,265
So, do you think Britney's
spelled with two "T" s or one?

640
00:27:19,351 --> 00:27:20,372
Or maybe they spell it
different,

641
00:27:20,458 --> 00:27:21,898
like with a "Y"
instead of "I", maybe?

642
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:23,101
Owen,
you have to stop.

643
00:27:23,187 --> 00:27:24,820
We've been having this
conversation for two weeks.

644
00:27:24,918 --> 00:27:26,031
We just need
to find them.

645
00:27:26,117 --> 00:27:28,442
We need to tell them
where their daughter is.

646
00:27:28,528 --> 00:27:30,383
And have you thought about
what you're gonna say to them

647
00:27:30,469 --> 00:27:31,373
if you find them?

648
00:27:31,458 --> 00:27:33,273
"Hi,
we're two strangers."

649
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:34,812
We took in
your daughter

650
00:27:34,898 --> 00:27:36,445
without going through
the foster system,

651
00:27:36,531 --> 00:27:39,073
and, oh, yeah,
we have her son,

652
00:27:39,208 --> 00:27:40,784
who you don't even
know exists.

653
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:42,372
"Congrats,
Grandma and Grandpa!"

654
00:27:43,589 --> 00:27:46,245
We at least need to tell
the social worker.

655
00:27:46,433 --> 00:27:50,003
Owen, she... she needs
to make that call herself.

656
00:27:50,089 --> 00:27:51,128
She's not ready.

657
00:27:51,227 --> 00:27:52,222
We can't push her.

658
00:27:52,308 --> 00:27:53,605
Why is she
running our lives?

659
00:27:53,691 --> 00:27:56,745
She's been lying to us, DCHS,
everyone for months,

660
00:27:56,831 --> 00:27:58,050
with no remorse.

661
00:27:58,291 --> 00:27:59,628
She had remorse.

662
00:27:59,792 --> 00:28:01,636
She's an addict.
She's figuring it out.

663
00:28:01,798 --> 00:28:03,612
This is all part
of the disease. Betty is...

664
00:28:03,698 --> 00:28:05,363
Her name
isn't even Betty!

665
00:28:05,605 --> 00:28:08,480
Sorry, I know that, yes, yes,
addiction is a disease,

666
00:28:08,668 --> 00:28:11,623
but since when does its symptoms
include lying

667
00:28:11,708 --> 00:28:13,550
and stealing from people
who are trying to help you?

668
00:28:13,768 --> 00:28:16,081
It just all feels
like an excuse

669
00:28:16,167 --> 00:28:18,582
for justifying
piss poor life choices.

670
00:28:25,418 --> 00:28:26,873
Wait,
where are you going?

671
00:28:27,024 --> 00:28:28,379
To Meredith's.

672
00:28:28,465 --> 00:28:30,550
Why?
I don't know.

673
00:28:30,838 --> 00:28:32,938
Piss poor life choices?

674
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:34,793
Wait, wait, Amelia.

675
00:28:34,878 --> 00:28:36,673
I'm sorry.
That was way out of line.

676
00:28:36,759 --> 00:28:38,514
You don't even
see the line.

677
00:28:40,182 --> 00:28:42,493
I don't know who I'm gonna be
if they take Leo away.

678
00:28:42,579 --> 00:28:43,852
He's my son.

679
00:28:45,347 --> 00:28:46,884
If they're gonna
take him...

680
00:28:48,371 --> 00:28:50,813
I need to know
sooner than later.

681
00:28:58,805 --> 00:29:01,090
Hey. I have a pitch
for tonight.

682
00:29:01,277 --> 00:29:02,602
You. Me.

683
00:29:02,898 --> 00:29:07,048
Movies. Pizza. Popcorn.
Candy. Sex.

684
00:29:07,141 --> 00:29:08,485
Repeat.

685
00:29:09,477 --> 00:29:11,102
You know
it's Valentine's Day, right?

686
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:12,368
You hate Valentine's Day.

687
00:29:12,454 --> 00:29:14,239
I know.
I'm trying new things.

688
00:29:14,477 --> 00:29:15,954
Really?

689
00:29:20,983 --> 00:29:22,563
I know you're hurting.

690
00:29:24,634 --> 00:29:26,470
I, um... I don't...

691
00:29:27,446 --> 00:29:29,899
I don't know
how to make it better.

692
00:29:31,498 --> 00:29:33,063
Yeah, neither do I.

693
00:29:33,365 --> 00:29:36,832
I just... I'm trying to do
normal stuff, you know?

694
00:29:36,918 --> 00:29:40,235
I just... feel so...

695
00:29:45,261 --> 00:29:46,985
On the worst day
of my mother's illness,

696
00:29:47,071 --> 00:29:50,470
I wanted to take her IV
and plunge it into my own arm.

697
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:53,899
I wanted out.

698
00:29:53,985 --> 00:29:57,293
Not just of that day
or that moment.

699
00:29:57,378 --> 00:30:00,876
I wanted
out of this life.

700
00:30:01,548 --> 00:30:04,712
It was a fleeting thought,
but it came, and...

701
00:30:05,689 --> 00:30:08,509
you know, that's how bad
the pain was.

702
00:30:08,595 --> 00:30:10,055
That's how bad
the fear was.

703
00:30:13,859 --> 00:30:15,470
So what'd you do?

704
00:30:15,719 --> 00:30:17,602
I shook. I shook.

705
00:30:18,941 --> 00:30:21,106
My muscles shook in ways
that I did not know

706
00:30:21,192 --> 00:30:22,368
they could move.

707
00:30:22,454 --> 00:30:25,282
And... then I, um...

708
00:30:25,588 --> 00:30:26,977
my eye
started twitching.

709
00:30:27,078 --> 00:30:30,188
Yeah. Yeah, my eye's been
twitching on and off all day.

710
00:30:30,274 --> 00:30:31,774
- Mm.
- And I've got, like,

711
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:33,938
this shortness-of-breath thing
happening,

712
00:30:34,024 --> 00:30:35,913
where I can't
hold a deep breath.

713
00:30:35,998 --> 00:30:37,958
All day, every day.

714
00:30:47,387 --> 00:30:49,235
- Hey, can I ask you a question?
- Yeah.

715
00:30:49,321 --> 00:30:51,993
How can you stand there and tell
Garrett to fight for love

716
00:30:52,079 --> 00:30:53,899
when you're the one
running away from it?

717
00:30:55,771 --> 00:30:59,306
I have three kids
and a big job.

718
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:05,232
What?

719
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:06,845
Nothing, just...
you know,

720
00:31:06,931 --> 00:31:09,282
I used to think you were
so beyond me, but you're not.

721
00:31:09,368 --> 00:31:11,212
You're like a kid
playing hide and seek,

722
00:31:11,298 --> 00:31:12,883
hiding behind
a million excuses.

723
00:31:13,048 --> 00:31:14,463
Happy Valentine's Day.

724
00:31:14,548 --> 00:31:15,641
Hi.

725
00:31:15,727 --> 00:31:18,392
Do you want to go
to dinner tonight?

726
00:31:18,628 --> 00:31:22,681
Are you... asking me out...
on Valentine's Day?

727
00:31:22,774 --> 00:31:24,003
I guess I am.

728
00:31:24,088 --> 00:31:25,463
Uh...

729
00:31:25,781 --> 00:31:26,931
Well, I'm, uh...

730
00:31:27,017 --> 00:31:29,602
I'm not one to usually
bang my head against a wall.

731
00:31:29,695 --> 00:31:31,009
- Is that a no?
- No, no.

732
00:31:31,095 --> 00:31:32,438
I'm banging my head.

733
00:31:32,524 --> 00:31:34,069
It's my new thing,
I guess.

734
00:31:34,155 --> 00:31:35,190
Um...

735
00:31:35,276 --> 00:31:37,691
I'll see you...
tonight?

736
00:31:37,878 --> 00:31:39,083
Okay.

737
00:31:53,729 --> 00:31:55,626
Ben,
you fixing the fence?

738
00:31:55,712 --> 00:31:57,077
You weren't
supposed to see me.

739
00:31:57,163 --> 00:31:58,298
Ah, Ben.

740
00:31:58,384 --> 00:31:59,833
N-No, Miranda,
Miranda, stop.

741
00:32:00,009 --> 00:32:02,095
Okay, it's my turn
to say things now.

742
00:32:02,363 --> 00:32:05,243
You said you wanted me
to be happy,

743
00:32:05,532 --> 00:32:06,587
to follow my bliss,

744
00:32:06,673 --> 00:32:09,008
and I did,
just like you told me to.

745
00:32:09,378 --> 00:32:11,079
And then you turned around
and left me over it.

746
00:32:11,243 --> 00:32:12,738
Now, I may be the one
sleeping somewhere else,

747
00:32:12,824 --> 00:32:14,524
but you left me.

748
00:32:15,298 --> 00:32:16,463
I know.

749
00:32:16,548 --> 00:32:17,798
I'm sorry.

750
00:32:17,884 --> 00:32:20,704
No, you can't leave me
like that again.

751
00:32:20,923 --> 00:32:22,253
Not ever. All right?

752
00:32:22,338 --> 00:32:24,833
You can take all the...
The job sabbaticals you want

753
00:32:24,918 --> 00:32:26,571
and... and change your career
a dozen times,

754
00:32:26,657 --> 00:32:28,482
and I will be with you
every step of the way.

755
00:32:28,568 --> 00:32:32,233
But either we are in this
together or we aren't.

756
00:32:32,418 --> 00:32:34,003
And I never planned
a version where we weren't.

757
00:32:34,088 --> 00:32:35,083
I know...

758
00:32:35,168 --> 00:32:36,583
No, don't say
"I know."

759
00:32:36,668 --> 00:32:37,998
Listen to me.

760
00:32:39,293 --> 00:32:40,958
I should've known
something wasn't right with you.

761
00:32:41,044 --> 00:32:43,493
I-I should've
helped you get help.

762
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:44,845
I-I should've...
I've seen it before.

763
00:32:44,931 --> 00:32:47,142
I should've
recognized it.

764
00:32:49,371 --> 00:32:51,689
When you had a heart attack,
I promised you

765
00:32:51,798 --> 00:32:54,158
I would build you
a treehouse,

766
00:32:54,418 --> 00:32:56,463
a place for you to go
when you would worry,

767
00:32:56,548 --> 00:32:58,753
when you felt overwhelmed,
when you needed to be alone,

768
00:32:58,838 --> 00:33:01,564
but I never followed through
on that.

769
00:33:03,088 --> 00:33:06,033
For that, I'm sorry.

770
00:33:12,478 --> 00:33:14,103
You're building me
a treehouse?

771
00:33:14,254 --> 00:33:17,542
Now, Miranda, I-I need to know
that this is not something

772
00:33:17,628 --> 00:33:20,333
that you can call "time out" on
ever again.

773
00:33:20,419 --> 00:33:21,510
Never.

774
00:33:21,596 --> 00:33:23,349
No, I-I promise you.

775
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:26,231
Well, then, yeah,
I-I'm building you a treehouse.

776
00:33:26,419 --> 00:33:28,583
It's, uh... It's not
finished yet, but, uh...

777
00:33:28,807 --> 00:33:30,450
I just figure, you know,
once I move back in,

778
00:33:30,536 --> 00:33:32,169
I can do a little bit of work
on it every morning.

779
00:33:33,617 --> 00:33:34,724
Oh!

780
00:33:35,918 --> 00:33:37,388
Oh!

781
00:33:43,431 --> 00:33:45,169
Dr. Schmitt said
you had something

782
00:33:45,258 --> 00:33:46,638
you want to discuss
with us?

783
00:33:50,657 --> 00:33:55,492
We've been in this hospital now
for over three months.

784
00:33:55,969 --> 00:33:58,153
Since then,
Natasha's only gotten worse.

785
00:33:58,354 --> 00:34:00,849
And I know you're
the best doctors we could get

786
00:34:00,989 --> 00:34:02,904
because I tried
to find better ones,

787
00:34:03,255 --> 00:34:04,810
but I couldn't.

788
00:34:05,751 --> 00:34:07,411
No offense.

789
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,536
Take me off the vent.

790
00:34:19,172 --> 00:34:20,966
I can't eat.

791
00:34:21,431 --> 00:34:23,919
I can't breathe.

792
00:34:25,752 --> 00:34:27,325
I'm dying.

793
00:34:30,304 --> 00:34:31,469
There are
other options.

794
00:34:31,555 --> 00:34:33,372
There's
home ventilator care.

795
00:34:33,458 --> 00:34:35,083
There's
long-term acute care.

796
00:34:35,168 --> 00:34:37,068
There's skilled
nursing facilities.

797
00:34:37,169 --> 00:34:38,232
They know.

798
00:34:38,318 --> 00:34:41,693
They've been consulting
palliative care doctors.

799
00:34:42,049 --> 00:34:45,582
You all have done
everything you can

800
00:34:45,668 --> 00:34:48,878
to give me
as much time as possible.

801
00:34:51,838 --> 00:34:54,173
We may not have gotten

802
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:56,413
that wedding
under the stars, but...

803
00:34:59,517 --> 00:35:03,767
You gave us
the rest of our lives together.

804
00:35:11,798 --> 00:35:13,611
Take me off.

805
00:35:14,447 --> 00:35:16,010
Please.

806
00:35:17,606 --> 00:35:18,896
Please.

807
00:35:23,948 --> 00:35:25,557
We need you
to give verbal consent

808
00:35:25,643 --> 00:35:27,111
as her power of attorney.

809
00:35:28,916 --> 00:35:30,361
I consent.

810
00:35:33,168 --> 00:35:35,361
So, once I shut
the machine off,

811
00:35:35,447 --> 00:35:37,729
I don't know
how much time you'll have,

812
00:35:37,815 --> 00:35:40,197
so we will give you meds
to keep you comfortable.

813
00:35:42,048 --> 00:35:43,549
Are you ready?

814
00:35:45,378 --> 00:35:47,003
Yeah.

815
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:48,361
Okay.

816
00:36:20,437 --> 00:36:21,892
Alex has an idea.

817
00:36:33,127 --> 00:36:35,290
Since when
do we do Valentine's?

818
00:36:35,376 --> 00:36:37,704
Since I've been an ass and needed
an excuse to make it up to you.

819
00:36:37,918 --> 00:36:39,048
Ah, that's my cue.

820
00:36:39,141 --> 00:36:41,136
I have a date,
for which I cannot be late.

821
00:36:41,498 --> 00:36:42,872
Hey.

822
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:46,419
Hi.

823
00:36:49,918 --> 00:36:51,253
Happy Valentine's Day.

824
00:36:51,338 --> 00:36:52,714
Uh, yeah.
Yeah.

825
00:36:53,214 --> 00:36:54,347
Hey.

826
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,684
Hey, are you guys free
to come to the ICU?

827
00:36:58,770 --> 00:36:59,840
What's up?
Just... Just come.

828
