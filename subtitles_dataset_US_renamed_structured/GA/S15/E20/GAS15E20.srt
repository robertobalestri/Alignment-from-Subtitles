00:00:19,991 --> 00:00:21,287
Maybe you should
see a doctor.

10

No, it's just a bug.

Well, you don't have
a fever.

- You're not throwing up.

Earlier this morning...
Donor's in Olympia.

26
00:00:51,726 --> 00:00:54,269
- And everything checks out?
- Yeah, it's a perfect match.

27
00:00:54,357 --> 00:00:55,441

Oh, we just finished.

33
00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:07,272
Any pain or nausea?
Dizziness?

34
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,186
I feel annoyed.

35
00:01:09,274 --> 00:01:10,593

nothing to do

- Mm.
- Mm.

39

40
00:01:21,474 --> 00:01:23,587
Well, we have
something for you.

41
00:01:23,689 --> 00:01:24,718
A gift.

42
00:01:24,806 --> 00:01:26,259
I don't see anything.

43
00:01:26,366 --> 00:01:29,443
It is a patient
that we brought in from L.A.

44
00:01:29,531 --> 00:01:30,710
for an abdominal wall
transplant.

45
00:01:30,797 --> 00:01:32,188
A gift implies jewelry.

46
00:01:32,276 --> 00:01:35,000
We are also going to transplant
his penis and scrotum.

47
00:01:36,669 --> 00:01:37,672

Hi, Leo!

62
00:02:14,493 --> 00:02:15,828
How you doing?
You good?

63
00:02:15,916 --> 00:02:17,774
No, you're not,
are you, buddy?

64
00:02:17,869 --> 00:02:19,406
You,
uh, got two molars coming in,

65
00:02:19,493 --> 00:02:20,906
so you've been
a terror at night.

66
00:02:20,993 --> 00:02:23,639
Well, teething is a natural
biological process.

67
00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:25,274
Don't let anyone
blame you for that.

68
00:02:25,362 --> 00:02:27,117
You tell Amelia
that's not what I said.

69
00:02:27,205 --> 00:02:28,658
You tell Owen
he doesn't have to

70
00:02:28,746 --> 00:02:30,656
communicate with me through a baby.

71
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:34,689
The house had
bay windows

72
00:02:34,777 --> 00:02:36,780
- and original hardwood floors and...
- And ghosts.

73
00:02:36,868 --> 00:02:38,532
Definitely ghosts
near that creepy fireplace.

74
00:02:38,619 --> 00:02:40,242
Oh, fun! Reunion!

75
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:42,703
Hey, so, you're
looking at houses, huh?

76
00:02:43,602 --> 00:02:46,133
And I'm gonna go see
a consult in the pit.

77
00:02:47,455 --> 00:02:49,672
Um...
I'm looking at houses.

78
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,116
Yeah, I went along
because I can tell you

79
00:02:51,203 --> 00:02:52,226
about a house's foundation

80
00:02:52,313 --> 00:02:54,085
by walking across
the floor barefoot.

81
00:02:54,173 --> 00:02:55,876
- It's one of my superpowers.
- Mm.

82
00:02:56,087 --> 00:02:57,530
I just... I don't want
to raise a baby

83
00:02:57,617 --> 00:02:58,734
in a...
In a hotel room.

84
00:02:58,822 --> 00:03:00,076
You know you can always
stay with me.

85
00:03:00,163 --> 00:03:01,366
I have plenty of room.

86
00:03:01,453 --> 00:03:02,806
And
baby supplies, you know.

87
00:03:02,893 --> 00:03:04,930
I... No, I-I'll...
I'll figure it out, thanks.

88
00:03:05,025 --> 00:03:06,508
Okay. Well, if you need,
we're here.

89
00:03:06,596 --> 00:03:08,453
- Okay.
- Bye.

90

You know,
I bet Owen's house

91
00:03:11,126 --> 00:03:12,665
doesn't have that cute
little breakfast nook.

92
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:15,373
You just said
it was haunted.

93
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:16,897

94
00:03:16,984 --> 00:03:18,500

99
00:03:25,641 --> 00:03:26,863

100
00:03:28,468 --> 00:03:30,281
You got an interview
I need to know about?

101
00:03:30,369 --> 00:03:31,070
No.

102
00:03:31,158 --> 00:03:33,275
No, I just got used to
wearing suits,

103
00:03:33,363 --> 00:03:34,391

104
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:36,969

So, where are the reports?

105
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,693

you filled them out.

106
00:03:40,781 --> 00:03:42,774

107
00:03:42,862 --> 00:03:44,155

108
00:03:44,243 --> 00:03:44,945
Chief Bailey?

109
00:03:45,033 --> 00:03:46,833
Sorry to interrupt,
but the students are here.

110
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:50,125
Hey, hey, you in a suit
sends a mixed message!

111
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,592
What s-s-students?

112
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,928
They're high schoolers
enrolled in a STEM program

113
00:03:55,016 --> 00:03:55,891
to learn about leadership.

114
00:03:55,979 --> 00:03:58,719
- You agreed to it last...
- Uh, no, I have to focus,

115
00:03:58,807 --> 00:04:01,719
not have ambitious teenagers
staring at me

116
00:04:01,776 --> 00:04:03,162
because they don't know
how to have a conversation.

117
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:06,016
So, I'm delegating...
You take them, and...

118
00:04:06,211 --> 00:04:08,711
Hello.
Welcome.

119
00:04:09,584 --> 00:04:13,617

- Hey.
- Hey.

121
00:04:21,259 --> 00:04:23,992
Um, hey, have you worked
with Webber since the...?

122
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,062
- The party?
- Mm-hmm.

123
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:27,164
No. You know, I've actually
managed to avoid it.

124
00:04:27,281 --> 00:04:29,515
He gave me a lap appy.

125
00:04:30,048 --> 00:04:31,774
What do you mean
he gave you a lap appy?

126
00:04:31,931 --> 00:04:33,522
He said, "DeLuca,
today's your lucky day.

127
00:04:33,609 --> 00:04:35,539
I've got a lap appy,
and I'm giving it to you."

128
00:04:36,219 --> 00:04:37,382
- Wow.
- Huh?

129
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:38,320
You think
it's strange, too?

130
00:04:38,408 --> 00:04:40,325
I think it's a test
you ought not fail.

131
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:41,367
What kind of test?

132
00:04:41,455 --> 00:04:42,787
Like a surgical test, or like a.

133
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:44,014
"You're dating Meredith Grey

134
00:04:44,102 --> 00:04:45,384
and I don't know
if I approve" test?

135
00:04:45,471 --> 00:04:47,224
Who cares? It's an appy.
You got it.

136
00:04:47,312 --> 00:04:48,435
I got to go get a penis.

137
00:04:48,523 --> 00:04:49,807
Okay. Wait. What?

138
00:04:49,894 --> 00:04:50,961
A penis?

139
00:04:51,487 --> 00:04:53,360
DeLuca, we got OR 2.

140
00:04:53,448 --> 00:04:54,602
Okay.
Thank you, sir.

141
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:55,665
I-I really appreciate
this.

142
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:56,776
I'm... I'm looking
forward to it.

143
00:04:56,863 --> 00:04:57,959
I should hope so.

144
00:04:58,047 --> 00:04:58,946

day 16 of cough
and recurrent sinus infection.

149
00:05:09,049 --> 00:05:10,508
He's been listless,
tired...

150
00:05:10,596 --> 00:05:12,875
Really pale.
And just... not himself.

151
00:05:13,024 --> 00:05:14,367
Every Saturday,
we get bagels

152
00:05:14,455 --> 00:05:15,779
and eat them outside
the Smith Tower.

153
00:05:15,866 --> 00:05:16,930
It's Gus's thing.

154
00:05:17,018 --> 00:05:19,204
He loves the history, knows
every single thing about it.

155
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:20,274
We haven't been
in three weeks.

156
00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:21,719
We'll figure out
what's going on.

157
00:05:21,807 --> 00:05:23,734
You do a chest X-ray?
A strep swab?

158
00:05:24,077 --> 00:05:25,860
I haven't been able to
do an exam.

159
00:05:25,948 --> 00:05:27,344
Gus is autistic.

160
00:05:27,432 --> 00:05:29,605
He struggles with being
physically touched.

161
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:30,883
Is he in any pain?

162
00:05:30,971 --> 00:05:32,224
I mean,
it's hard to tell.

163
00:05:32,312 --> 00:05:34,465
He... He just doesn't
communicate like other kids do.

164
00:05:34,553 --> 00:05:36,446
Well, there are things we can
try that may help. May I?

165
00:05:36,533 --> 00:05:38,406
Uh, please.

166
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:40,516
Hey, Gus, I'm Alex.

167
00:05:40,604 --> 00:05:42,055
I like your book.

168
00:05:42,143 --> 00:05:43,750
You think buildings
are pretty cool, huh?

169
00:05:43,841 --> 00:05:46,994
The exterior of the Smith Tower
has only been washed once.

170
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,008
In 1976.

171
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:51,094
Really?
That's neat.

172
00:05:51,282 --> 00:05:52,764
You know, if you look out
that window over there,

173
00:05:52,851 --> 00:05:54,474
you just might see
the Space Needle.

174
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:55,852
Wanna try?

175
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,076
And while you look over there,

176
00:06:00,163 --> 00:06:01,331
I'm just gonna take a look
in your eyes real quick...

177
00:06:01,418 --> 00:06:02,533
Gus.

178
00:06:02,621 --> 00:06:03,655
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

179
00:06:03,742 --> 00:06:04,753
- It's okay. It's okay, Gus.
- It's all right.

180
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,212
Should I get the O2?

181
00:06:07,511 --> 00:06:08,760
Slowly breathe in.

182
00:06:08,848 --> 00:06:10,369
How are we supposed to
help him?

183
00:06:10,463 --> 00:06:11,588
We get creative.

184
00:06:11,676 --> 00:06:13,749
Breathe out.
Breathe in.

185
00:06:13,947 --> 00:06:15,419
All right.

186
00:06:15,507 --> 00:06:17,130
Just breathe.

187
00:06:17,802 --> 00:06:19,461
<i>Hey, let's go!</i>

188
00:06:19,549 --> 00:06:21,200
- Hello?
- Oh! Megan!

189
00:06:21,288 --> 00:06:23,321
- Hi, Meredith!
- Hi!

190
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:25,036
- How are you?
- I'm good!

191
00:06:25,127 --> 00:06:27,224
You look fantastic!
Are you well?

192
00:06:27,312 --> 00:06:28,776
How are you feeling?
What's happening?

193
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:30,023
- Is there...
- Oh, I'm sorry.

194
00:06:30,116 --> 00:06:30,990
- Did you want to look at it?
- Yes!

195
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:35,771
- There you go.
- Wow.

196
00:06:35,859 --> 00:06:37,482
I know. Hey!

197
00:06:37,592 --> 00:06:39,585
This stomach won the
Catherine Fox Award, people.

198
00:06:39,673 --> 00:06:41,546
You should all
be looking at it, too.

199
00:06:41,634 --> 00:06:42,919
That looks really good.

200
00:06:43,007 --> 00:06:44,341
Yeah.
Well, you did it.

201
00:06:44,429 --> 00:06:47,012
So, now, tell me...
there's no pain, no tenderness, no...?

202
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,664
Nothing. And by the way,
lifting up my shirt

203
00:06:48,751 --> 00:06:51,013
was how I convinced my patient
to get the same surgery,

204
00:06:51,101 --> 00:06:52,419
so, you know,
don't mess up.

205
00:06:52,507 --> 00:06:53,597
Fantastic.
I'm on my way

206
00:06:53,685 --> 00:06:54,793
- to do the procurement now.
- Mm-hmm.

207
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,433
And just for the record,
I did not tell

208
00:06:56,521 --> 00:06:58,050
Teddy and Owen
that you were coming,

209
00:06:58,138 --> 00:06:59,373
in case you want to
surprise them.

210
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,749
Teddy?

211
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:02,079
Teddy's here?

212
00:07:02,167 --> 00:07:03,910
Yes, Teddy is here.

213
00:07:04,283 --> 00:07:06,276
Oh, my God.

214
00:07:06,366 --> 00:07:08,170
Oh. Bed 3's ready to
go up to CT...

215
00:07:08,258 --> 00:07:09,761
Yep. Oh.

216
00:07:09,905 --> 00:07:11,624
- Oh, no.
- What?

217
00:07:11,749 --> 00:07:13,358
Oh, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no!

218
00:07:13,446 --> 00:07:14,483
What?

219
00:07:14,571 --> 00:07:15,890
What is wrong with you?!

220
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:17,645
Hey, Megan,
before you get started,

221
00:07:17,733 --> 00:07:18,810
- I just want to...
- Why didn't you tell me

222
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:21,194
that you two had <i>finally</i>
gotten together?!

223
00:07:22,413 --> 00:07:24,195
And we're having a baby?!

224
00:07:24,283 --> 00:07:25,866
Oh, my God, come on!

225
00:07:25,954 --> 00:07:27,327
I am so happy!

226
00:07:27,415 --> 00:07:28,897
- Oh, my God!
- Oh!

227
00:07:28,985 --> 00:07:29,944
Um, Megan...

228
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:30,702
Um...

229
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:31,826
- Megan.
- Oh, God.

230
00:07:33,485 --> 00:07:36,210
- Um.
- What?

231
00:07:48,046 --> 00:07:50,608
Megan? Just making sure
you're okay...

232
00:07:50,696 --> 00:07:51,428
Uh...

233
00:07:51,561 --> 00:07:53,543
She's okay.
She's... She's processing.

234
00:07:53,631 --> 00:07:54,358
Right?
You're processing?

235
00:07:54,446 --> 00:07:55,808
I mean,
it's a lot to process.

236
00:07:55,896 --> 00:07:57,116
Yeah.

237
00:07:57,204 --> 00:07:59,350
Yeah. It's a lot.

238
00:07:59,438 --> 00:08:02,850
It's just
so much stupidity

239
00:08:02,938 --> 00:08:04,874
that my brain is struggling
to take it all in.

240
00:08:04,962 --> 00:08:06,415
- Okay, Megan, come on...
- I mean...

241
00:08:06,503 --> 00:08:08,686
so much stupidity.

242
00:08:09,485 --> 00:08:11,373
You went to Germany
for one night,

243
00:08:11,461 --> 00:08:12,413
knocked her up,

244
00:08:12,501 --> 00:08:14,083
and then screwed it up
so badly

245
00:08:14,171 --> 00:08:17,067
that you gave her your job
instead of a ring?!

246
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:18,358
You dum-dum!

247
00:08:18,446 --> 00:08:19,675
Oh, are you calling me
dum-dum? Are we 6?

248
00:08:19,762 --> 00:08:21,319
No, Owen,
we are stone-cold adults.

249
00:08:21,421 --> 00:08:23,522
But what you did here
is so stupid

250
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:24,996
that the word "idiot"
felt too sophisticated,

251
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:26,435
so, yes,
I'm sticking with "dum-dum"!

252
00:08:26,522 --> 00:08:27,301
Do you...

253
00:08:27,396 --> 00:08:28,895
Well, I-I kind of
want to defend you,

254
00:08:28,983 --> 00:08:29,997
but it never goes well when

255
00:08:30,084 --> 00:08:31,214
- I get in between you and Megan.
- Oh.

256
00:08:31,301 --> 00:08:32,607
She's lying.
That's a lie.

257
00:08:32,695 --> 00:08:34,046
She doesn't want to
defend you, Owen.

258
00:08:34,133 --> 00:08:36,089
She wants to call you something
way worse than "dum-dum."

259
00:08:36,176 --> 00:08:37,209
For the record?

260
00:08:37,297 --> 00:08:38,692
This is exactly why
I didn't tell you.

261
00:08:38,779 --> 00:08:41,428
No. It was your own
deep-seated shame.

262
00:08:41,516 --> 00:08:42,695
Ugh, so you're a shrink now?

263
00:08:42,782 --> 00:08:44,114
- Altman.
- Mnh.

264
00:08:44,223 --> 00:08:45,546
247 Lawndale.

265
00:08:45,634 --> 00:08:46,569
I'll check it out.
Great, thanks.

266
00:08:46,657 --> 00:08:48,554
No, no, you got to see it,
and soon. It's, uh, perfect.

267
00:08:48,641 --> 00:08:50,634
Is, uh,
this your Realtor?

268
00:08:50,722 --> 00:08:53,139
Um. No. Um...

269
00:08:53,796 --> 00:08:55,663
This is my...
This is my boyfriend. Ah.

270
00:08:55,751 --> 00:08:57,124
Um...
Ah.

271
00:08:57,211 --> 00:08:58,833
Uh, Megan, Tom.
Tom, Megan.

272
00:08:58,921 --> 00:08:59,992
Megan Hunt.

273
00:09:02,149 --> 00:09:03,732
- Dum-dum.
- Sorry?

274
00:09:03,912 --> 00:09:05,235
Not you.

275
00:09:09,986 --> 00:09:14,110
And then, I isolate
the pudendal nerve, and you...

276
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:17,452
Hello?

277
00:09:17,953 --> 00:09:20,625
Yeah. The, um,
trickiest part of an appy

278
00:09:20,713 --> 00:09:22,796
is if it's retrocecal,
right?

279
00:09:23,055 --> 00:09:24,138
Why?

280
00:09:24,264 --> 00:09:26,374
Because Andrew
is doing an appy today

281
00:09:26,462 --> 00:09:28,415
- with Richard.
- DeLuca?

282
00:09:28,503 --> 00:09:29,915
- Yeah.
- He'll be fine.

283
00:09:30,003 --> 00:09:31,485
DeLuca's passed appys.

284
00:09:31,591 --> 00:09:34,040
Now, can you
pay attention to this, please?

285
00:09:34,582 --> 00:09:36,835
Sure. I...
I won an award for this.

286
00:09:36,923 --> 00:09:38,179
And I didn't
because I was nice enough

287
00:09:38,266 --> 00:09:39,349
to take my name off of it.

288
00:09:39,437 --> 00:09:40,719
- Remember?
- Mm.

289
00:09:40,807 --> 00:09:42,376
This is a whole different
ba...

290
00:09:42,464 --> 00:09:45,730
What? Were you just about
to say "ball game"?

291
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:47,739
I was gonna say it's important
that we don't mess this up.

292
00:09:47,826 --> 00:09:49,096
- Okay.
- All right? That we get it right.

293
00:09:49,183 --> 00:09:50,557
It's my mom's
first surgery back.

294
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:53,444
Yeah, I was gonna say
"ball game."

295
00:10:01,571 --> 00:10:03,581
Oh, you're pretty good
at that.

296
00:10:04,087 --> 00:10:06,860
It takes 41 seconds
to ride the elevator

297
00:10:06,948 --> 00:10:08,703
to the top
of the Space Needle.

298
00:10:09,211 --> 00:10:10,726
- Yeah.
- On a non-windy day.

299
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:13,406
Really?
That seems fast.

300
00:10:13,501 --> 00:10:14,664
It is.

301
00:10:17,595 --> 00:10:19,539
Gus, do you ever get
a pain in your chest?

302
00:10:19,627 --> 00:10:20,695
Like,
when you take a walk,

303
00:10:20,783 --> 00:10:22,414
does it hurt a little
to breathe?

304
00:10:23,726 --> 00:10:25,976
Does it hurt a lot?
Or a little?

305
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:31,461
Does it hurt...
this much?

306
00:10:32,749 --> 00:10:34,125
Or more?

307
00:10:50,328 --> 00:10:51,661
That much?

308
00:10:52,048 --> 00:10:53,131
Let's get a chest CT.

309
00:10:58,578 --> 00:10:59,654
You got through to him.

310
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:01,310
Yeah, let me know
when the scans are up.

311
00:11:01,398 --> 00:11:03,231
<i>Dr. Brody, call Radiology.</i>

312
00:11:03,319 --> 00:11:04,779
Dr. Jeannette Brody,
call Radiology.

313
00:11:04,867 --> 00:11:07,097
Hey.
Have you talked to Jo

314
00:11:07,185 --> 00:11:08,967
since she got back
from visiting her birth mom?

315
00:11:09,054 --> 00:11:11,013
Jo found her birth mom?
Whoa.

316
00:11:11,131 --> 00:11:12,319
- What happened?
- I-I don't know.

317
00:11:12,406 --> 00:11:14,083
But it wasn't good.
She won't talk to me.

318
00:11:14,171 --> 00:11:16,138
She won't return
Meredith's calls or Bailey's.

319
00:11:16,241 --> 00:11:17,865
She won't come to work.

320
00:11:17,953 --> 00:11:20,446
But she trusts you.
Maybe you can talk to her?

321
00:11:20,534 --> 00:11:22,115
Be like her... her
Legos, or...

322
00:11:22,203 --> 00:11:24,488
- Huh?
- Just maybe you can reach her, or...

323
00:11:24,576 --> 00:11:26,130
or distract her.

324
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:27,661
I-I don't know what.

325
00:11:27,749 --> 00:11:29,466
- Can you try? Please?
- Yeah.

326
00:11:29,554 --> 00:11:31,701
Uh, I'll
move some stuff around.

327
00:11:31,789 --> 00:11:33,307
Thanks.

328
00:11:36,303 --> 00:11:38,333
Oh!
You're in here.

329
00:11:38,506 --> 00:11:40,872
- Hey, can you...
- I'm sorry. I need your room.

330
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,925
I just had a stupid
elevator ride with Owen,

331
00:11:43,013 --> 00:11:45,263
which was... pain.
It was painful.

332
00:11:45,359 --> 00:11:46,310
Which you would think
it wouldn't be.

333
00:11:46,398 --> 00:11:47,704
I mean,
I'm having great sex.

334
00:11:47,792 --> 00:11:49,435
I'm having aerobic sex!

335
00:11:49,523 --> 00:11:50,914
I mean, I'm waking up
with endorphins...

336
00:11:54,055 --> 00:11:55,638
Dr. Shepherd,
meet the students

337
00:11:55,726 --> 00:11:58,044
from the STEM
leadership program.

338
00:11:58,132 --> 00:12:01,365
Dr. Shepherd is our
chief of neurosurgery.

339
00:12:03,451 --> 00:12:06,326
Who can define
"endorphins"?

340
00:12:12,213 --> 00:12:14,122
- Okay.
- Uh.

341
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:16,214
Alicia Davis, 24, admitted with

342
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:17,543
- severe abdominal pain...
- Mm-hmm.

343
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:19,794
...which then localized
in the right-lower quadrant.

344
00:12:19,882 --> 00:12:21,052
Inability
to keep food down...

345
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,840
Which was weird,
because I'm pretty ruthless

346
00:12:22,927 --> 00:12:24,520
about what I put into my body.

347
00:12:25,006 --> 00:12:26,911
You are, too, I bet,
look at you.

348
00:12:28,085 --> 00:12:29,247
Uh.

349
00:12:30,585 --> 00:12:32,872
Right, um,
which made sense, then,

350
00:12:32,982 --> 00:12:34,880
when the CT showed
an inflamed appendix...

351
00:12:34,968 --> 00:12:36,247
Do you CrossFit, bro?

352
00:12:36,384 --> 00:12:37,513
I'm a CrossFit fiend.

353
00:12:37,601 --> 00:12:38,974
Uh, no.
Sadly, no time.

354
00:12:39,062 --> 00:12:40,895
I could train you.
Or with you.

355
00:12:41,061 --> 00:12:42,684
I'm the real deal.

356
00:12:42,772 --> 00:12:44,494
I have
almost a million followers

357
00:12:44,581 --> 00:12:45,584
on Instagram.

358
00:12:45,671 --> 00:12:46,724
- See?
- That's okay.

359
00:12:46,812 --> 00:12:47,827
- Just look!
- Really, I'm good.

360
00:12:47,914 --> 00:12:49,872
I just want to get you prepped
for surgery.

361
00:12:49,968 --> 00:12:53,043
Uh, patient care
includes

362
00:12:53,131 --> 00:12:55,490
putting the patient at ease,
Dr. DeLuca.

363
00:12:55,578 --> 00:12:57,044
Right.

364
00:12:57,753 --> 00:12:59,169
Let's have a look.

365
00:13:02,182 --> 00:13:03,982
I'm hot, right?

366
00:13:04,596 --> 00:13:06,259
I'm saying,
don't leave a scar.

367
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:08,249
Uh-huh.

368
00:13:14,154 --> 00:13:16,396
Caleb Hicks, 29,

369
00:13:16,492 --> 00:13:18,536
here for
an abdominal wall,

370
00:13:18,624 --> 00:13:19,974
penis and scrotum
transplant.

371
00:13:20,062 --> 00:13:21,513
He sustained major injuries

372
00:13:21,601 --> 00:13:23,521
to his lower extremities
and pelvic area

373
00:13:23,649 --> 00:13:25,644
during an IED blast
in Afghanistan

374
00:13:25,732 --> 00:13:26,646
about a year ago.

375
00:13:26,734 --> 00:13:27,857
Are you her?

376
00:13:27,979 --> 00:13:29,442
Are you Catherine Fox?

377
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:30,584
Indeed.

378
00:13:30,672 --> 00:13:31,883
It's a pleasure
to meet you, Caleb.

379
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:34,115
You're a legend to
the online support groups,

380
00:13:34,203 --> 00:13:36,662
like the Neil Armstrong
of Johnsons.

381
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:39,213
I'll take that.
I'll take...

382
00:13:39,301 --> 00:13:42,783
Well, I just want to make sure
that you're completely clear

383
00:13:42,871 --> 00:13:44,584
about the extent
of this surgery.

384
00:13:44,671 --> 00:13:46,544
Not only is it
a massive piece of tissue

385
00:13:46,631 --> 00:13:47,786
from another man's body,

386
00:13:47,874 --> 00:13:49,567
but the recovery is...

387
00:13:49,655 --> 00:13:51,513
It's rough.
I know.

388
00:13:51,709 --> 00:13:55,242
Dr. Hunt explained it to me
in L.A., and I can do it.

389
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:57,075
- I'm ready.
- Okay.

390
00:13:57,163 --> 00:13:59,567
And my mom came in from Reno
to help out.

391
00:13:59,655 --> 00:14:01,731
I'll be here until
Anna gets back.

392
00:14:01,892 --> 00:14:03,849
Anna's my fiancée.

393
00:14:03,937 --> 00:14:05,680
She's on an Air Force mission
for 10 days,

394
00:14:05,768 --> 00:14:07,646
and then she's on nursing duty.
Okay.

395
00:14:07,734 --> 00:14:09,901
Then we will come back
and prep you

396
00:14:09,989 --> 00:14:11,954
as soon as
Dr. Avery and Dr. Grey

397
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:13,487
are on their way
with the organ,

398
00:14:13,575 --> 00:14:14,874
and... and then both
Dr. Hunts

399
00:14:14,961 --> 00:14:16,888
will be assisting me
in the OR.

400
00:14:17,045 --> 00:14:18,247
- Both?
- Oh, yes,

401
00:14:18,335 --> 00:14:20,286
this is a very complex procedure.

402
00:14:20,374 --> 00:14:22,316
We're gonna need
an additional set of hands,

403
00:14:22,404 --> 00:14:24,544
so I thought Caleb would be
most comfortable

404
00:14:24,671 --> 00:14:25,966
with another veteran.

405
00:14:26,054 --> 00:14:28,217
- Oh.
- It's nice to meet you.

406
00:14:28,383 --> 00:14:29,974
- Okay.
- Hello.

407
00:14:36,868 --> 00:14:38,356
I know you're in there!

408
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:39,731
So...

409
00:14:39,948 --> 00:14:41,821
I'll just keep knocking.

410
00:14:51,079 --> 00:14:52,862
Chicken soup?

411
00:14:52,963 --> 00:14:54,155
Heard you were sick.

412
00:14:54,256 --> 00:14:55,431
I'm not hungry.

413
00:14:56,613 --> 00:14:58,499
This Chinese joint
on Weller...

414
00:14:58,587 --> 00:15:01,897
They sell out most days
because it is so good.

415
00:15:01,995 --> 00:15:03,774
You shouldn't be in here.
I'm... I'm contagious.

416
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:05,358
I'm throwing up sick.

417
00:15:05,454 --> 00:15:07,907
Do you want it in a bowl,
or just out of the container?

418
00:15:07,995 --> 00:15:09,488
I don't want any...

419
00:15:09,611 --> 00:15:11,772
Brought some
for myself, too.

420
00:15:12,388 --> 00:15:14,267
Mmm. Soup.

421
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:18,712
Whatever.

422
00:15:31,596 --> 00:15:34,002
Okay. Once we have positioned
the donor tissue,

423
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:35,534
we'll start by
connecting the urethra.

424
00:15:35,621 --> 00:15:36,400
What's next?

425
00:15:36,488 --> 00:15:37,916
- Corpus cavernosum?
- Exactly.

426
00:15:38,004 --> 00:15:40,122
So, do we know which vessels
we're getting from the donor?

427
00:15:40,209 --> 00:15:42,166
Schmitt, vessels... that's
the next thing we'll anastomose.

428
00:15:42,253 --> 00:15:45,088
Name them. Megan, I'm just trying
to get up to speed here, so...

429
00:15:45,176 --> 00:15:46,510
Go, Schmitt.

430
00:15:46,658 --> 00:15:48,838
Dorsal, deep dorsal,
superficial dorsal,

431
00:15:48,926 --> 00:15:50,439
superficial pudendal,
femoral...

432
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,919
Greater saphenous
and deep epigastric.

433
00:15:52,006 --> 00:15:53,669
Listen, I am sorry

434
00:15:53,756 --> 00:15:55,438
I didn't tell you everything,
but it's complicated...

435
00:15:55,525 --> 00:15:56,478
Now let's talk
about the nerves.

436
00:15:56,566 --> 00:15:57,400
And it's my life,

437
00:15:57,488 --> 00:15:59,658
and I get to decide when
I share important details...

438
00:15:59,746 --> 00:16:00,806
Should I leave?

439
00:16:00,894 --> 00:16:02,017
- No.
- Please.

440
00:16:02,236 --> 00:16:04,127
Listen,
before we go in this OR,

441
00:16:04,215 --> 00:16:05,798
I want to make sure
that we're okay.

442
00:16:05,886 --> 00:16:07,643
Do you know how long I've been
working with Caleb?

443
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:08,783
10 months.

444
00:16:08,871 --> 00:16:11,000
And now we are finally here,
and he is ready,

445
00:16:11,088 --> 00:16:12,136
and I don't have time
to deal with

446
00:16:12,223 --> 00:16:13,495
your constant need
to make everything okay.

447
00:16:13,582 --> 00:16:15,378
What I do need right now
is to make sure

448
00:16:15,466 --> 00:16:16,729
that you understand
the steps of this procedure.

449
00:16:16,816 --> 00:16:19,197
- Do you?
- Yes.

450
00:16:19,285 --> 00:16:20,291
Okay, nerves.

451
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:21,534
We want to do
the nerve coaptation

452
00:16:21,621 --> 00:16:23,033
as far distally as we can.

453
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:26,689
 <i>Dr. Thatcher...
Dr. Kirsten Thatcher, 6411.</i>

454
00:16:33,244 --> 00:16:34,425
You're good
on your plane dissection?

455
00:16:34,512 --> 00:16:37,181
- Yes. Time, please?
- We barely started.

456
00:16:37,269 --> 00:16:39,222
I'm thinking about the appy.
They're quick.

457
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:40,948
They should be finished by now,
don't you think?

458
00:16:41,036 --> 00:16:42,225
Richard's with him.
He'll be fine.

459
00:16:42,312 --> 00:16:43,370
Right, well,
that's the problem.

460
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:45,495
At your party, Andrew and I
were having a moment,

461
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:46,782
and Richard kind of
walked...

462
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:48,613
Oh. He caught you.

463
00:16:49,006 --> 00:16:50,041
Yes.

464
00:16:50,129 --> 00:16:52,412
Well, he caught me
and Maggie once, too.

465
00:16:52,663 --> 00:16:54,166
I felt like I was 14.

466
00:16:54,254 --> 00:16:55,583
What is that about?

467
00:16:55,715 --> 00:16:57,814
Don't worry about that.
Worry about the appy patient.

468
00:16:57,971 --> 00:17:00,260
If you're feeling this nervous,
imagine how DeLuca feels.

469
00:17:00,348 --> 00:17:01,580
It's just an appy.

470
00:17:01,668 --> 00:17:03,661
So simple.
Yet so easy to overthink.

471
00:17:03,804 --> 00:17:04,967
I hate you.

472
00:17:08,558 --> 00:17:09,767
Have you seen
a picture of it?

473
00:17:09,855 --> 00:17:12,056
Yes.
You'll be happy.

474
00:17:12,425 --> 00:17:14,135
Happy how?

475
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:17,072
What's it look like?

476
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:21,150
- It looks... healthy.
- Come on.

477
00:17:21,238 --> 00:17:23,213
Could you at least tell him
the donor's shoe size?

478
00:17:23,301 --> 00:17:24,572
Geez.

479
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:25,916
Caleb, look who's here.

480
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:27,885
Oh, my God.
What happened to you?

481
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,260
Anna!
You made it!

482
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:30,424
Get out.

483
00:17:30,512 --> 00:17:32,189
Caleb,
your mom called me...

484
00:17:32,277 --> 00:17:34,690
I don't want her here.
She needs to leave!

485
00:17:35,067 --> 00:17:36,360
Get her out now!

486
00:17:36,448 --> 00:17:38,401
- Hey. Hey, hey, hey.
- Whoa.

487
00:17:45,372 --> 00:17:47,375
That's a large mass
on the thymus gland. How old?

488
00:17:47,463 --> 00:17:48,760
Uh, 10.

489
00:17:48,997 --> 00:17:51,135
In kids, thymomas
are always malignant,

490
00:17:51,223 --> 00:17:53,674
but, luckily, resecting them
can be completely curative.

491
00:17:53,769 --> 00:17:55,228
I can scrub in.

492
00:17:59,099 --> 00:18:01,642
Hey, Jo's been out all week.
Is everything okay?

493
00:18:02,088 --> 00:18:03,720
I'll book the OR.

494
00:18:06,713 --> 00:18:07,994
Gus is severely anemic...

495
00:18:08,082 --> 00:18:09,878
We can't operate
until we transfuse him.

496
00:18:17,895 --> 00:18:19,791
I know
what you're doing.

497
00:18:20,389 --> 00:18:22,602
Just laundry.
Not that big a mystery.

498
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:24,533
You're checking on me.
I don't need it.

499
00:18:24,621 --> 00:18:26,322
I just need
to go to sleep.

500
00:18:26,496 --> 00:18:28,409
Do you have a basket
or something?

501
00:18:28,535 --> 00:18:29,865
Please leave.

502
00:18:35,207 --> 00:18:36,986
Do you remember
Bronwyn Murphy?

503
00:18:38,235 --> 00:18:39,768
Your redheaded
bartender girlfriend

504
00:18:39,926 --> 00:18:41,879
with the "Texas" tattoo?

505
00:18:44,185 --> 00:18:45,768
Remember when
she dumped me?

506
00:18:46,027 --> 00:18:47,480
- Vaguely.
- Vaguely?

507
00:18:47,676 --> 00:18:48,938
I drank for three days.

508
00:18:49,026 --> 00:18:50,869
I-I missed so much work,
I almost got fired.

509
00:18:50,957 --> 00:18:51,960
So what's your point?

510
00:18:52,096 --> 00:18:54,635
I was a shell.

511
00:18:55,053 --> 00:18:56,220
I couldn't move.

512
00:18:56,402 --> 00:19:00,050
But I had this friend
who came over to my place,

513
00:19:00,138 --> 00:19:01,985
even though all I wanted
in the world

514
00:19:02,073 --> 00:19:03,253
was to be left alone.

515
00:19:03,341 --> 00:19:05,674
In fact, I told her that.
Several times.

516
00:19:05,838 --> 00:19:08,838
But... she stayed.

517
00:19:10,637 --> 00:19:12,050
And she did my laundry.

518
00:19:12,138 --> 00:19:13,381
So this is revenge?

519
00:19:13,469 --> 00:19:16,112
It's just a friend
doing another friend's laundry.

520
00:19:24,753 --> 00:19:27,462
Oh, I'd give the soup
another minute to cool.

521
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:29,380
I'm pretty sure
they boil it before they...

522
00:19:34,809 --> 00:19:36,151
Don't mind if I do.

523
00:19:36,384 --> 00:19:37,972
I wasn't offering.

524
00:19:39,859 --> 00:19:41,519
I'll take one, anyway.

525
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:52,954
- Why would you call her?
- She said you needed me.

526
00:19:53,042 --> 00:19:54,931
Right! So I dropped
everything, and I came...

527
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:56,923
Despite being dumped
nine months ago

528
00:19:57,011 --> 00:19:58,384
with no explanation.

529
00:19:58,472 --> 00:19:59,392
What do you mean, dumped?

530
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,767
You told me she was gonna take
care of you after surgery,

531
00:20:01,856 --> 00:20:03,165
when she got back from...

532
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:05,431
- Where were you assigned?
- No, I'm not on assignment.

533
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:06,665
I came from San Diego.

534
00:20:06,753 --> 00:20:08,361
- What surgery?
- Lord.

535
00:20:08,449 --> 00:20:10,157
Are you getting a procedure
for a prosthetic leg

536
00:20:10,244 --> 00:20:11,119
or something...?

537
00:20:11,207 --> 00:20:12,220
It's none of her business.

538
00:20:12,307 --> 00:20:13,381
She's supposed to be
your support system...

539
00:20:13,468 --> 00:20:15,554
You listed her
in your evaluation.

540
00:20:15,642 --> 00:20:16,815
You knew that having
a support system

541
00:20:16,902 --> 00:20:18,877
was essential for you
being able to get this surgery.

542
00:20:18,964 --> 00:20:20,337
- You knew that.
- What surgery?!

543
00:20:20,425 --> 00:20:23,088
Can we please
just get everyone out of here

544
00:20:23,176 --> 00:20:24,709
and then do my surgery?

545
00:20:24,797 --> 00:20:27,494
Okay? And then I'll leave
everyone alone.

546
00:20:33,772 --> 00:20:34,765
Caleb's been prepping
for months.

547
00:20:34,853 --> 00:20:36,080
- You can't just say no.
- The hell I can't.

548
00:20:36,167 --> 00:20:37,001
Catherine,
just wait a minute.

549
00:20:37,089 --> 00:20:38,470
We got it...
Everything's intact.

550
00:20:38,558 --> 00:20:39,743
Why isn't everyone
in the OR?

551
00:20:39,831 --> 00:20:41,220
The surgery is off!

552
00:20:41,392 --> 00:20:44,061
I'm not giving that man
a penis today.

553
00:20:45,989 --> 00:20:48,801
Any questions
about the urology floor?

554
00:20:51,966 --> 00:20:55,388
I'm creating a window at the
base of the mesoappendix now.

555
00:20:55,476 --> 00:20:58,052
- You're good to get it? Or...
- Yes. Absolutely.

556
00:20:58,364 --> 00:21:00,227
What's your plan here?

557
00:21:00,315 --> 00:21:01,728
Excuse me?

558
00:21:01,974 --> 00:21:04,928
Where do you see this going?
Long-term?

559
00:21:06,555 --> 00:21:08,880
Sir, I...

560
00:21:09,624 --> 00:21:12,130
We've not really had
those discussions yet.

561
00:21:12,224 --> 00:21:13,376
Uh, I mean,
she's got a family.

562
00:21:13,463 --> 00:21:14,877
That informs
where she's coming from...

563
00:21:14,964 --> 00:21:16,404
and I certainly
want to respect that.

564
00:21:16,492 --> 00:21:17,871
But, uh, for me?

565
00:21:17,959 --> 00:21:19,079
She's amazing, sir.

566
00:21:19,184 --> 00:21:20,349
She makes me so happy.

567
00:21:20,437 --> 00:21:21,630
You know, I'm... I'm...
She...

568
00:21:21,718 --> 00:21:22,505
I'm gonna stop you right now

569
00:21:22,593 --> 00:21:23,588
because my question was...

570
00:21:23,676 --> 00:21:26,227
...where do you see
your surgical career going,

571
00:21:26,315 --> 00:21:27,354
long-term?

572
00:21:27,442 --> 00:21:28,956
And whether you've thought
about a specialty.

573
00:21:29,044 --> 00:21:30,097
Um.

574
00:21:30,184 --> 00:21:32,200
Oh, right.
Uh... shoot.

575
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:37,281
Well, uh, g-general surgery...
is attractive.

576
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:39,559
What a surprise.

577
00:21:39,647 --> 00:21:41,630
All right,
do you see that, sir?

578
00:21:41,723 --> 00:21:43,253
Is that a dead bowel?
It is.

579
00:21:43,341 --> 00:21:44,956
The terminal ileum's
been compromised.

580
00:21:45,044 --> 00:21:45,760
What do you want to do?

581
00:21:45,848 --> 00:21:47,539
I think we need to convert
to an open procedure.

582
00:21:47,644 --> 00:21:48,609
- What do you think?
- I think you're right.

583
00:21:48,697 --> 00:21:50,262
All right,
let's pull the trocars.

584
00:21:57,889 --> 00:22:00,052
Ma, it's gonna be
a grueling surgery, all right?

585
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:02,000
You haven't been
in the OR in a while now.

586
00:22:02,088 --> 00:22:05,216
The patient is not mentally
or emotionally prepared

587
00:22:05,304 --> 00:22:06,648
for a transplant.

588
00:22:06,736 --> 00:22:08,867
We're taking a piece
of another person's body

589
00:22:08,955 --> 00:22:10,742
and putting it onto his.

590
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,703
He needs a support team
for that,

591
00:22:12,846 --> 00:22:15,015
just like I had
for my own surgery.

592
00:22:15,103 --> 00:22:17,755
As much as all the constant
nagging and worrying

593
00:22:17,843 --> 00:22:19,078
makes me crazy...

594
00:22:19,274 --> 00:22:22,148
If I didn't have you
or Richard,

595
00:22:22,338 --> 00:22:24,547
I couldn't have done
any of this.

596
00:22:25,074 --> 00:22:27,037
The surgery is off.

597
00:22:29,075 --> 00:22:32,367
And don't you dare accuse me
of being scared or tired.

598
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:34,010
Even though
I'm a little bit of both,

599
00:22:34,097 --> 00:22:36,125
but that
is not the reason.

600
00:22:41,934 --> 00:22:43,307
<i>Dr. Lowe to Maternity.</i>

601
00:22:43,394 --> 00:22:46,031
<i>Dr. Kathy Lowe to Maternity.</i>

602
00:22:46,119 --> 00:22:48,976
Uh, I think she's right.
I'm sorry.

603
00:22:50,726 --> 00:22:53,042
Keep everything on ice,
keep everybody close, okay?

604
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:54,682
I'm gonna fix this...
I just need to talk to Caleb.

605
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:55,648
I'll do it.

606
00:22:55,736 --> 00:22:57,551
No, Owen.
It's my patient.

607
00:22:57,639 --> 00:22:58,888
I don't need you to swoop in
and save the day.

608
00:22:58,976 --> 00:23:00,247
Do you have a penis?

609
00:23:05,124 --> 00:23:08,134
I cannot believe
this is the one time

610
00:23:08,222 --> 00:23:09,741
this could make
a difference.

611
00:23:10,024 --> 00:23:11,529
Fine.
Just don't screw it up

612
00:23:11,617 --> 00:23:13,091
like you screwed up
the rest of your life.

613
00:23:18,255 --> 00:23:19,891
Okay, now, you have to run
the bowel through your...

614
00:23:19,978 --> 00:23:22,336
From the ligament of Treitz
all the way down... I did.

615
00:23:22,424 --> 00:23:24,456
- Okay, make sure you feel for...
- Wait. Sir, hold on.

616
00:23:24,544 --> 00:23:25,299
Is...

617
00:23:25,387 --> 00:23:27,073
Is this...
Is it a Meckel's band?

618
00:23:27,161 --> 00:23:29,574
It is. What is it?

619
00:23:29,784 --> 00:23:30,893
Meckel's diverticulum,

620
00:23:30,981 --> 00:23:33,386
a congenital anomaly
of the small intestine.

621
00:23:33,566 --> 00:23:36,167
The band seems to be kinking off
the blood supply.

622
00:23:36,661 --> 00:23:38,154
I have to do
an ileocecectomy.

623
00:23:38,242 --> 00:23:39,823
No. You don't.
I do.

624
00:23:39,911 --> 00:23:41,645
- It's my surgery.
- No, your surgery was an appy.

625
00:23:41,732 --> 00:23:42,909
This was an incidental finding.

626
00:23:42,997 --> 00:23:44,753
Yeah, but it's my
incidental finding.

627
00:23:44,841 --> 00:23:46,862
DeLuca... I staple off
the area of necrosis.

628
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:48,731
Right? You don't even
know what stapler to use.

629
00:23:48,818 --> 00:23:51,519
GIA 60 with
3.8-millimeter staples.

630
00:24:01,406 --> 00:24:02,619
This one, right?

631
00:24:05,091 --> 00:24:06,894
In kids, the thymus gland
helps regulate

632
00:24:06,982 --> 00:24:08,628
the body's
immune responses.

633
00:24:08,716 --> 00:24:09,817
But since he has
a tumor there...

634
00:24:09,904 --> 00:24:11,607
His gland
isn't working properly,

635
00:24:11,695 --> 00:24:13,542
so it's causing
all sorts of symptoms...

636
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:15,917
Uh, his cough, his fatigue,
his discomfort.

637
00:24:16,005 --> 00:24:17,245
But this transfusion
should help

638
00:24:17,333 --> 00:24:18,706
get his
red blood cell count up,

639
00:24:18,794 --> 00:24:20,287
correcting the anemia.

640
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:22,558
- And then you'll do the surgery?
- Correct.

641
00:24:22,852 --> 00:24:25,605
God, a tumor.
And anemia.

642
00:24:25,833 --> 00:24:28,206
I just thought we were gonna
take out his tonsils.

643
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:30,207
Dr. Karev!

644
00:24:31,294 --> 00:24:33,207
Give him space,
or you'll scare him more.

645
00:24:33,295 --> 00:24:35,918
Sweetie, you're all right.

646
00:24:36,107 --> 00:24:37,895
You need to pull the IV.
Can you back up, please?

647
00:24:37,982 --> 00:24:39,074
H-He doesn't like
to be touched.

648
00:24:39,161 --> 00:24:40,701
It's not a panic attack.
It's a reaction to the blood.

649
00:24:40,788 --> 00:24:42,741
Why? Why is he
reacting to the blood?

650
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,131
It's okay, Gus. It's okay.

651
00:24:46,218 --> 00:24:48,480
We've got you.
All right, Gus.

652
00:24:48,631 --> 00:24:50,834
Good, good.
Take a deep breath.

653
00:24:56,301 --> 00:24:57,878
- What are you doing?
- Hey.

654
00:24:57,966 --> 00:25:00,097
Oh, I'm trying to
find a place for my baby

655
00:25:00,231 --> 00:25:02,394
that doesn't share walls
with strangers

656
00:25:02,482 --> 00:25:05,706
who can hear her wail all night
while I fail at new parenting.

657
00:25:05,794 --> 00:25:06,867
And apparently,

658
00:25:06,954 --> 00:25:08,867
it has to be
in a good school district.

659
00:25:16,854 --> 00:25:18,425
You're house-hunting.

660
00:25:18,803 --> 00:25:20,556
With another guy, Teddy?

661
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:23,419
I... I'm not
moving in with Tom.

662
00:25:23,507 --> 00:25:24,536
He's... He's just...
You know, he's helping...

663
00:25:24,624 --> 00:25:26,496
I watched you suffer
from afar for years,

664
00:25:26,583 --> 00:25:27,916
I watched you love him
for years,

665
00:25:28,004 --> 00:25:29,964
and then I watched you
suffer some more.

666
00:25:30,203 --> 00:25:33,073
I'm sure the neurosurgeon
is... lovely,

667
00:25:33,161 --> 00:25:34,987
but my brother is single.

668
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:36,535
And you love him.
And you've always loved him.

669
00:25:36,622 --> 00:25:38,207
And he's an idiot,
but he loves you, too.

670
00:25:38,294 --> 00:25:39,747
And now he has Leo
and a crib,

671
00:25:39,835 --> 00:25:41,535
and I know for sure that
he would want you to move in,

672
00:25:41,622 --> 00:25:43,737
and... and then... and...

673
00:25:43,825 --> 00:25:46,368
It can be easy,
and it can evolve.

674
00:25:46,456 --> 00:25:49,050
Megan, I'm not gonna m-move
in to that house.

675
00:25:49,138 --> 00:25:49,956
I-I... And... what...

676
00:25:50,051 --> 00:25:52,094
Just... slide into
Amelia's place in their bed?

677
00:25:52,794 --> 00:25:54,867
I mean,
that is not gonna happen.

678
00:25:54,954 --> 00:25:56,139
And, I mean,
Megan, if it were you,

679
00:25:56,226 --> 00:25:59,833
you would burn the house down
before you moved into it.

680
00:26:00,268 --> 00:26:03,161
I would.

681
00:26:04,716 --> 00:26:06,591
Totally would.

682
00:26:06,764 --> 00:26:09,044
I totally would.

683
00:26:09,132 --> 00:26:10,826
I am so happy you're here.

684
00:26:10,914 --> 00:26:13,247
- So, where were you stationed?
- Near Kandahar.

685
00:26:13,545 --> 00:26:16,122
- Not a lot of trees.
- No.

686
00:26:16,631 --> 00:26:19,294
I, uh, spent most of my time
in Fallujah.

687
00:26:19,418 --> 00:26:21,286
When I got back,
I would...

688
00:26:21,714 --> 00:26:23,651
still kick my shoes out
for sand.

689
00:26:23,739 --> 00:26:25,362
It's a kind of habit,
I guess.

690
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,964
Don't have
that problem anymore.

691
00:26:28,458 --> 00:26:30,081
Yeah.

692
00:26:31,464 --> 00:26:32,997
I didn't lie to Anna.

693
00:26:33,374 --> 00:26:34,432
When I broke up with her,

694
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,863
I told her I wasn't
right in the head.

695
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:37,073
And I wasn't.

696
00:26:37,201 --> 00:26:38,799
You went through
something terrible.

697
00:26:39,093 --> 00:26:41,536
Took one wrong step,
and I became a monster.

698
00:26:41,624 --> 00:26:42,464
Nobody thinks that.

699
00:26:42,552 --> 00:26:45,112
I woke up, and a part of me
was missing.

700
00:26:45,847 --> 00:26:47,354
And I'm not talking about
my leg.

701
00:26:47,442 --> 00:26:49,448
I can live with one leg.

702
00:26:50,303 --> 00:26:52,506
I didn't feel like
a man anymore.

703
00:26:52,625 --> 00:26:54,206
I didn't know
if I could live like that,

704
00:26:54,294 --> 00:26:56,944
and I didn't want Anna to live
like that, either.

705
00:26:57,544 --> 00:26:58,865
Yeah.

706
00:26:58,968 --> 00:27:01,011
You know, I was in
an explosion over there, too.

707
00:27:01,099 --> 00:27:02,936
I didn't suffer
like you have, but...

708
00:27:03,647 --> 00:27:05,178
I, uh...

709
00:27:05,438 --> 00:27:07,203
I lost my whole platoon.

710
00:27:07,314 --> 00:27:08,437
- Damn.
- Yeah.

711
00:27:08,618 --> 00:27:09,952
They sent me home,

712
00:27:10,039 --> 00:27:12,187
and I broke up
with my fiancée

713
00:27:12,275 --> 00:27:14,195
with a three-line
e-mail.

714
00:27:15,645 --> 00:27:16,938
I mean,
she wasn't right for me,

715
00:27:17,026 --> 00:27:19,572
but I'm still ashamed
of how I treated her.

716
00:27:20,152 --> 00:27:21,674
Anna's...

717
00:27:22,109 --> 00:27:23,752
She's right for me.

718
00:27:24,335 --> 00:27:26,705
She's everything.
She's my...

719
00:27:27,648 --> 00:27:30,088
She was my everything.

720
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:31,986
You owe her better
than what she got.

721
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:35,603
Give her a chance, Caleb.

722
00:27:35,925 --> 00:27:37,775
You know, talk to her.

723
00:27:38,685 --> 00:27:40,447
Sometimes, when
you give people a chance,

724
00:27:40,551 --> 00:27:42,618
they show up in ways
you wouldn't believe.

725
00:27:58,247 --> 00:28:00,243
And he just told her the truth?

726
00:28:00,414 --> 00:28:02,617
He did. And she's
not going anywhere.

727
00:28:02,705 --> 00:28:04,458
And this is supposed to
change my mind?

728
00:28:04,614 --> 00:28:07,260
Him having
one conversation?

729
00:28:07,869 --> 00:28:09,353
Catherine,
I know this guy.

730
00:28:09,441 --> 00:28:11,049
I've been this guy.

731
00:28:11,137 --> 00:28:12,456
When I came back,
I wasn't myself.

732
00:28:12,543 --> 00:28:14,095
I did things
that I wasn't proud of...

733
00:28:14,183 --> 00:28:15,369
It took me several months

734
00:28:15,457 --> 00:28:16,713
just to knock on
my mom's door

735
00:28:16,801 --> 00:28:18,213
to tell her
that I was home.

736
00:28:18,512 --> 00:28:20,338
And I didn't lose
a part of my body.

737
00:28:20,734 --> 00:28:22,362
Catherine, I operated
on guys over there,

738
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:23,385
and when they woke up,

739
00:28:23,473 --> 00:28:25,646
the first question
they would ask was,

740
00:28:25,768 --> 00:28:26,939
"Is it still there?"

741
00:28:27,058 --> 00:28:29,258
And they weren't talking about
their legs or their arms.

742
00:28:30,141 --> 00:28:32,267
Every time Caleb
changes his clothes,

743
00:28:32,355 --> 00:28:35,808
goes to the bathroom,
looks down... he's triggered.

744
00:28:35,949 --> 00:28:37,986
So I believe this surgery

745
00:28:38,074 --> 00:28:39,931
is what he needs
to move forward.

746
00:28:40,019 --> 00:28:42,275
I believe this will help him
far more

747
00:28:42,458 --> 00:28:43,951
than it could possibly
hurt him.

748
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:51,151
What do you mean,
you don't know?

749
00:28:51,238 --> 00:28:52,322
I mean, I don't know!

750
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:54,650
I read the crossmatch as AB...
He got AB.

751
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:56,982
We do not give children
the wrong blood

752
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:58,158
in this hospital, Karev.

753
00:28:58,246 --> 00:29:00,416
We do not give adults the wrong
blood in this hospital.

754
00:29:00,504 --> 00:29:01,997
So, someone,
please explain to me

755
00:29:02,116 --> 00:29:04,909
what the hell is going on
and how this isn't a lawsuit,

756
00:29:05,058 --> 00:29:06,492
so I can lower my voice!

757
00:29:06,648 --> 00:29:09,231
You see this, girls?
This is leadership.

758
00:29:09,319 --> 00:29:10,508
We're running
a second crossmatch

759
00:29:10,595 --> 00:29:11,744
to check
his blood type again.

760
00:29:11,831 --> 00:29:12,632
His chart says AB.

761
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,421
It's gotta be
something else, right?

762
00:29:14,569 --> 00:29:16,061
Second crossmatch is up.

763
00:29:16,207 --> 00:29:17,537
He's definitely AB.

764
00:29:17,632 --> 00:29:19,389
- Positive or negative?
- Neither.

765
00:29:19,477 --> 00:29:20,563
- What?
- Huh?

766
00:29:20,818 --> 00:29:22,225
He's Rh-Null.

767
00:29:22,313 --> 00:29:23,537
What is that?

768
00:29:23,671 --> 00:29:25,147
That's golden blood.

769
00:29:25,234 --> 00:29:28,576
It's a rare blood type
that lacks all Rh antigens.

770
00:29:28,664 --> 00:29:31,889
No positive, no negative.
I've never seen this.

771
00:29:31,977 --> 00:29:33,140
How rare is rare?

772
00:29:33,277 --> 00:29:34,901
Pretty rare, 'cause
I've never heard of it.

773
00:29:34,988 --> 00:29:37,733
Less than 50 people have been
documented to have it.

774
00:29:41,069 --> 00:29:44,084
Close with 2-0 PDS?
Good call.

775
00:29:44,172 --> 00:29:45,928
All right, clamps.

776
00:29:46,474 --> 00:29:48,927
Look, I'm... I'm sorry.

777
00:29:49,015 --> 00:29:50,268
I overstepped.
I was...

778
00:29:50,356 --> 00:29:53,639
Terse. A little more terse
than necessary.

779
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:54,850
I'm sorry.
I just...

780
00:29:54,938 --> 00:29:56,717
I-I could see the whole
procedure in my head.

781
00:29:56,805 --> 00:29:57,733
You know,
you gave me the case...

782
00:29:57,821 --> 00:29:59,984
I wanted to do the case
from start to finish.

783
00:30:00,113 --> 00:30:02,217
I wanted to show you
that I was worthy of...

784
00:30:03,233 --> 00:30:04,526
Malleable?

785
00:30:06,099 --> 00:30:07,834
Worthy of what?

786
00:30:08,434 --> 00:30:09,967
A career
in general surgery.

787
00:30:10,055 --> 00:30:11,968
Well, Dr. Grey's
head of that department.

788
00:30:12,056 --> 00:30:14,373
- It's not up to me.
- Of course.

789
00:30:14,461 --> 00:30:17,045
I could put in
a good word.

790
00:30:17,193 --> 00:30:18,986
Or are you set there?

791
00:30:20,445 --> 00:30:22,358
That would be great, sir.
Thank you.

792
00:30:22,505 --> 00:30:23,838
You got this?

793
00:30:23,972 --> 00:30:25,095
Yes, sir.

794
00:30:30,173 --> 00:30:32,716
So, how did you convince
your mother to do the surgery?

795
00:30:32,804 --> 00:30:34,465
Oh, I didn't.
That was all Hunt.

796
00:30:34,553 --> 00:30:35,793
Basically,
I just accused her

797
00:30:35,881 --> 00:30:37,506
of being scared
to come back.

798
00:30:37,594 --> 00:30:39,379
I bet she loved that.

799
00:30:39,467 --> 00:30:40,295
Yep.

800
00:30:40,383 --> 00:30:42,381
- Heparinized saline in here, please.
- Uh-huh.

801
00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:45,162
There we go.

802
00:30:45,326 --> 00:30:46,826
You know,
ever since she got sick,

803
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:48,686
I'm scared all the time.

804
00:30:48,774 --> 00:30:50,553
Even if things are fine.

805
00:30:50,641 --> 00:30:52,094
Well, I was scared
for Richard.

806
00:30:52,182 --> 00:30:54,055
Uh, I did not want him
to lose another person.

807
00:30:54,143 --> 00:30:56,676
You know, the weird thing is,
when I first found out,

808
00:30:56,764 --> 00:30:59,557
my initial thought was,
"Okay, my mom is gonna die.

809
00:30:59,645 --> 00:31:01,678
It's just gonna be me
and Richard and..."

810
00:31:01,766 --> 00:31:03,819
Then I remembered
I actually have a father.

811
00:31:04,374 --> 00:31:06,538
Whole time, did not occur to me
once that I had a father.

812
00:31:06,625 --> 00:31:08,328
Same thing happened to me
with Thatcher.

813
00:31:08,416 --> 00:31:10,334
I was sitting with him,
and I thought,

814
00:31:10,422 --> 00:31:12,595
"Oh, I actually have
a father.

815
00:31:12,683 --> 00:31:15,176
And he's dying,
but... I have a father,

816
00:31:15,264 --> 00:31:16,701
and it's not
Richard Webber."

817
00:31:19,086 --> 00:31:23,748
Well, I think we are prepped
and ready to re-scrub.

818
00:31:25,147 --> 00:31:26,655
All right.
It's all yours.

819
00:31:26,743 --> 00:31:27,826
What?
Where are you going?

820
00:31:27,951 --> 00:31:29,990
I have to go spend some time
in my lab...

821
00:31:30,078 --> 00:31:32,365
You know, work on my next
groundbreaking thing.

822
00:31:33,049 --> 00:31:35,122
I'm taking my name off.
We're even.

823
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:37,467
You just don't want to do
an extremely long surgery

824
00:31:37,555 --> 00:31:38,678
you already
won an award for.

825
00:31:38,766 --> 00:31:40,779
You don't need to go to
the moon twice.

00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:08,444
<i><font color=#ffff00>♪ Pray for us ♪</font></i>

859
00:33:08,597 --> 00:33:12,373
I promise, if things get worse,
I will tell you.

860
00:33:12,737 --> 00:33:16,115
I promise I will not keep
any more secrets from you.

861
00:33:17,536 --> 00:33:18,869
Thank you.

862
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:24,740
Oh, we got
a good blood flow.

863
00:33:25,059 --> 00:33:29,052
Aww. Thank you, baby.
This was a beautiful gift.

864
00:33:32,819 --> 00:33:34,012
It's true.

865
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:35,100
Well...

866
00:33:35,195 --> 00:33:37,506
She didn't even have
a tattoo of Texas.

867
00:33:37,594 --> 00:33:40,233
It was just
the word "Texas."

868
00:33:40,321 --> 00:33:41,326
She...

869
00:33:41,414 --> 00:33:43,264
She had a picture of it
further down her back.

870
00:33:43,410 --> 00:33:46,358
Classy.

871
00:33:49,276 --> 00:33:51,772
Okay, all right, Bronwyn
wasn't perfect, but I was...

872
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:53,764
Bronwyn.

873
00:33:53,859 --> 00:33:55,115
I was in love with her,

874
00:33:55,203 --> 00:33:56,342
- Aww.
- And it still hurt.

875
00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:57,795
It... It... It hurt

876
00:33:57,883 --> 00:33:59,100
when she dumped me.

877
00:33:59,188 --> 00:34:01,231
She was doing you a favor.

878
00:34:01,364 --> 00:34:04,147
Ah, didn't feel like it.

879
00:34:04,289 --> 00:34:06,022
Okay, it's time you knew.

880
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:09,740
She wasn't even from Texas.

881
00:34:09,828 --> 00:34:11,662
She was from Delaware,
I think.

882
00:34:15,271 --> 00:34:17,981
I've done that favor a lot.

883
00:34:19,793 --> 00:34:21,216
Huh?

884
00:34:22,012 --> 00:34:24,747
Do you remember when
I started at the restaurant?

885
00:34:25,288 --> 00:34:29,621
I had just walked out
on another job in Kingston.

886
00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:32,143
I was dating
this waiter there. Logan.

887
00:34:32,231 --> 00:34:33,394
I really liked him.

888
00:34:33,482 --> 00:34:34,686
I mean,
he was kind of a stoner,

889
00:34:34,773 --> 00:34:38,106
but he was cute
and polite

890
00:34:38,194 --> 00:34:40,169
and a good kisser.

891
00:34:41,075 --> 00:34:42,513
Dated for months.

892
00:34:42,785 --> 00:34:46,282
And then, one day,
we were making out after work,

893
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:48,396
and he said, "I love you."

894
00:34:48,506 --> 00:34:50,694
And I felt...

895
00:34:53,301 --> 00:34:55,210
I felt the opposite

896
00:34:55,666 --> 00:34:56,989
of how that
should make you feel.

897
00:34:57,077 --> 00:34:58,234
I felt...

898
00:34:59,413 --> 00:35:01,265
like he was wrong.

899
00:35:01,404 --> 00:35:04,734
Like no one should ever
feel that way about me.

900
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:07,546
I couldn't even look
at him.

901
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:09,663
I just left.

902
00:35:09,988 --> 00:35:13,454
I didn't call him.
I didn't call work.

903
00:35:13,542 --> 00:35:16,455
I just moved to a different part
of town and started a new job,

904
00:35:16,543 --> 00:35:19,601
like none of it
had ever happened.

905
00:35:20,012 --> 00:35:23,827
I did the same thing
to a guy in high school.

906
00:35:23,915 --> 00:35:25,226
And then there was Paul.

907
00:35:25,314 --> 00:35:27,491
Now, you left Paul
to save your life.

908
00:35:29,763 --> 00:35:31,671
It's in my wiring.

909
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:35,612
My mother was a runner.

910
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,585
She still is, apparently.

911
00:35:37,673 --> 00:35:39,593
She can't even sit
in the same room as me,

912
00:35:39,681 --> 00:35:41,819
even though
she says she loves me.

913
00:35:43,158 --> 00:35:44,905
And my father...

914
00:35:50,421 --> 00:35:52,583
I always run.
It's what I do.

915
00:36:05,177 --> 00:36:07,420
I think
you've maybe had enough.

916
00:36:07,648 --> 00:36:09,574
I don't really care
what you think.

917
00:36:18,851 --> 00:36:21,100
Oh, uh...

918
00:36:21,928 --> 00:36:24,335
Yes. Uh...

919
00:36:24,423 --> 00:36:26,559
You came here
seeking a teacher.

920
00:36:26,647 --> 00:36:29,676
You came here
looking for... Yoda.

921
00:36:29,892 --> 00:36:31,805
And I was not
your Yoda today.

922
00:36:31,938 --> 00:36:33,219
I can be.

923
00:36:33,307 --> 00:36:34,786
In... In fact,
I'm an excellent Yoda,

924
00:36:34,874 --> 00:36:36,394
but not today.

925
00:36:36,482 --> 00:36:39,347
Uh, I will look
into rescheduling.

926
00:36:39,543 --> 00:36:41,101
Uh.

927
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:43,558
Are you kidding?

928
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:45,841
About which part?

929
00:36:45,935 --> 00:36:47,513
We learned so much.

930
00:36:47,601 --> 00:36:49,709
Leadership skills,
communication.

931
00:36:49,797 --> 00:36:52,013
You told an intern to
"move his sorry damn ass

932
00:36:52,101 --> 00:36:53,029
before you move it
for him

933
00:36:53,117 --> 00:36:54,545
in a way that
he would not appreciate..."

934
00:36:54,632 --> 00:36:57,059
You have a secret
innovative medicine lab

935
00:36:57,147 --> 00:36:58,599
and a blue light room
and...

936
00:36:58,687 --> 00:37:00,788
And you're always on the move,
rolling with the punches,

937
00:37:00,875 --> 00:37:02,084
solving problems...

938
00:37:02,172 --> 00:37:04,834
And the women!
It's all women!

939
00:37:05,005 --> 00:37:06,974
Better than Yoda,
you were.

940
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:08,543
Chief Bailey?

941
00:37:08,631 --> 00:37:10,210
I hear you're looking
for the compliance reports?

942
00:37:10,297 --> 00:37:11,834
You're ruining a moment,
Schmitt.

943
00:37:12,086 --> 00:37:14,334
Dr. Karev has me do them
every month.

944
00:37:14,924 --> 00:37:16,466
- I'm sorry?
- Yeah.

945
00:37:16,554 --> 00:37:18,755
And Helm does the agency
and overtime costs,

946
00:37:18,843 --> 00:37:20,756
Parker does the quality
and employee metrics,

947
00:37:20,844 --> 00:37:23,547
and Qadri does
the vendor contracts...

948
00:37:32,476 --> 00:37:36,599
Hey! Your appy turned into
a four-hour ileocecectomy?

949
00:37:36,748 --> 00:37:39,669
DeLuca's ileocecectomy.

950
00:37:39,765 --> 00:37:41,098
Really?
How'd he do?

951
00:37:41,186 --> 00:37:42,669
Oh, it was... was fine.

952
00:37:42,846 --> 00:37:44,443
He got a little snippy
with me, though.

953
00:37:44,557 --> 00:37:45,770
Snippy?

954
00:37:45,857 --> 00:37:47,350
Oh, he had a plan,

955
00:37:47,437 --> 00:37:49,197
and he... he wanted
to see it through, and...

956
00:37:49,701 --> 00:37:51,274
he was right.

957
00:37:51,362 --> 00:37:52,466
Huh.

958
00:37:52,554 --> 00:37:53,942
He's a surgeon,
Meredith.

959
00:37:54,097 --> 00:37:55,575
And a good one.

960
00:37:55,736 --> 00:37:57,052
He's a good man.

961
00:38:09,962 --> 00:38:11,655
What does that mean,
"rare blood"?

962
00:38:11,743 --> 00:38:12,962
Does that matter?

963
00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:14,698
Don't you have all kinds
of blood in a bank?

964
00:38:14,785 --> 00:38:16,157
Uh, or O-Negative?

965
00:38:16,245 --> 00:38:17,618
Isn't that
the universal donor?

966
00:38:17,828 --> 00:38:20,728
Gus can only receive blood
of the exact same type he has.

967
00:38:20,816 --> 00:38:22,979
And until we find enough donors,
we can't operate.

968
00:38:23,067 --> 00:38:24,736
How long
will that take?

969
00:38:25,198 --> 00:38:27,759
So far, we've found
four potential donors.

970
00:38:28,069 --> 00:38:29,829
In... Washington?

971
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:31,986
In the world.

972
00:38:33,187 --> 00:38:34,876
Oh, my God.

973
00:38:36,017 --> 00:38:37,720
So he's just gonna get sicker?

974
00:38:37,807 --> 00:38:39,310
Well, we're going to do
everything we can

975
00:38:39,397 --> 00:38:40,470
to correct his anemia

976
00:38:40,557 --> 00:38:41,845
without transfusing him...

977
00:38:41,933 --> 00:38:43,415
We'll find the blood.

978
00:38:44,049 --> 00:38:45,012
Dr. Karev...

979
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:46,673
We're not gonna stop
until we find it.

980
00:38:46,921 --> 00:38:49,165
He didn't want to tell us
what was wrong, but he did,

981
00:38:49,347 --> 00:38:52,540
and now we're not gonna give up
until we fix him, okay?

982
00:38:52,894 --> 00:38:54,517
Thank you.

983
00:39:06,171 --> 00:39:09,259
- Is that after expenses?
- Yep.

984
00:39:09,883 --> 00:39:12,517
And did you see the way
they separated the departments

985
00:39:12,605 --> 00:39:13,603
with the columns?

986
00:39:13,691 --> 00:39:15,181
With the headings?

987
00:39:15,616 --> 00:39:17,985
Oh. That's very nice.

988
00:39:18,821 --> 00:39:20,517
He had the interns
do all of this?

989
00:39:20,605 --> 00:39:21,978
Mm-hmm.

990
00:39:23,439 --> 00:39:24,759
It's ingenious.

991
00:39:24,847 --> 00:39:26,142
Right?

992
00:39:26,376 --> 00:39:30,626
Karev did something
better than us.

993
00:39:31,783 --> 00:39:33,946
And he can never know.

994
00:39:42,587 --> 00:39:44,087
Hey.

995
00:39:45,712 --> 00:39:47,111
You saved the case.

996
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:49,131
You're welcome.
I wasn't saying thank you.

997
00:39:49,233 --> 00:39:50,853
So, just
more name-calling, then?

998
00:39:50,941 --> 00:39:52,603
Owen.
I love you.

999
00:39:52,691 --> 00:39:54,407
I call you names
because someone has to.

1000
00:39:54,495 --> 00:39:55,587
Someone has to
tell you the truth.

1001
00:39:55,674 --> 00:39:57,431
Oh, the truth
that I'm an idiot?

1002
00:39:57,577 --> 00:39:59,400
That you need help.

1003
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:02,651
That you need to do for yourself what
you just did for Caleb.

1004
00:40:02,837 --> 00:40:05,429
You need to find a...
A way to heal enough

1005
00:40:05,517 --> 00:40:06,658
to believe
that you are worthy

1006
00:40:06,745 --> 00:40:09,892
of joy and happiness
and ease in this life.

1007
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:11,415
Because you are.
But somehow...

1008
00:40:11,503 --> 00:40:12,929
I'm thinking
because of trauma...

1009
00:40:13,017 --> 00:40:14,060
I'm thinking because
of war

1010
00:40:14,147 --> 00:40:15,681
and pain and ugliness
and PTSD...

1011
00:40:15,769 --> 00:40:17,059
Somehow,
you've come to believe

1012
00:40:17,147 --> 00:40:18,346
that you aren't deserving
of those things,

1013
00:40:18,433 --> 00:40:19,973
so you keep making the hardest
possible choices!

1014
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:22,053
Y'know, Megan, I'm sorry
we can't all be perfect.

1015
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,443
We can't all be
you and Riggs.

1016
00:40:23,531 --> 00:40:25,274
Owen. Shut up.
Seriously.

1017
00:40:25,362 --> 00:40:27,556
I see a talk therapist
once a week,

1018
00:40:27,644 --> 00:40:29,967
I see a somatic PTSD specialist
once a week.

1019
00:40:30,181 --> 00:40:32,392
Riggs and I see
a couples therapist one a week

1020
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,969
because I want to be as happy as
I can for the life I have left.

1021
00:40:35,056 --> 00:40:35,837
Don't you?

1022
00:40:35,925 --> 00:40:37,310
- I've done therapy, Megan.
- Not enough!

1023
00:40:37,397 --> 00:40:38,627
Since when are you
an authority...

1024
00:40:38,714 --> 00:40:41,087
You went to Germany, and you
told Teddy that you loved her,

1025
00:40:41,186 --> 00:40:43,469
and then revealed that,
24 hours previously,

1026
00:40:43,557 --> 00:40:45,220
you had been in bed
with your ex-wife,

1027
00:40:45,307 --> 00:40:46,310
so she kicked you out.

1028
00:40:46,397 --> 00:40:48,173
How do you not go
and get a hotel room

1029
00:40:48,261 --> 00:40:50,924
and try again the next day
and the next day and the next?

1030
00:40:51,012 --> 00:40:52,131
How do you
go back to the States

1031
00:40:52,218 --> 00:40:53,673
and get back in bed
with your ex-wife

1032
00:40:53,761 --> 00:40:56,610
and have a foster baby
and a teenage addict?!
