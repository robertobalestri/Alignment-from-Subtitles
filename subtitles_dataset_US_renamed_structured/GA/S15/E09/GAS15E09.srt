00:00:02,339 --> 00:00:04,187
You can always come back,
okay?

3
00:00:04,354 --> 00:00:06,304
I'm pregnant with your baby.

4
00:00:06,401 --> 00:00:10,882
Dr. Grey, if you don't squeeze
all the love and joy you can

5
00:00:10,991 --> 00:00:13,193
out of this one life
you've been given,

6
00:00:13,275 --> 00:00:15,077
I'm gonna haunt you
from my grave.

7
00:00:15,218 --> 00:00:17,114
- Yes.
- Yes to...?

8
00:00:17,196 --> 00:00:18,088
Drinks.

9
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:20,758
You gave up your job
and your husband.

10
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,105
You need to get some help.

11
00:00:22,187 --> 00:00:24,105
I'm so sorry.
It's your mom.

12
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:33,048
- What?
- What?

13
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:35,290
Did you hear that? Oh, my God.
We're gonna die in here.

14
00:00:35,357 --> 00:00:37,197
But if this is how I die,

15
00:00:37,277 --> 00:00:39,048
it's okay.

17
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:43,295

19
00:00:45,444 --> 00:00:47,992
To feel sheltered.
Protected.

20
00:00:48,067 --> 00:00:51,048
For most people,
it means a home.

21
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:53,418
For most surgeons,
it means a hospital.

22
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,874
I don't care if
100 utility poles are down.

23
00:00:55,951 --> 00:00:57,608
You need to get
the damn lights back on.

24
00:00:57,671 --> 00:00:58,671
No, I don't.

25
00:00:58,734 --> 00:01:00,103
That's what
the generators are for.

26
00:01:00,166 --> 00:01:01,655
Well, then, why
aren't they doing it?

27
00:01:01,718 --> 00:01:04,508
'Cause it takes them
a little while to kick in.

28
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:07,088
See?

29
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:08,895
That's why I'm in charge
of the building.

30
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:12,435
Smug.
That's smug.

31
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:15,008
I don't care for it.

32
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:17,435
In the hospital,
we're rarely blindsided.

33
00:01:17,517 --> 00:01:19,048
This is weird.

34
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:21,878
The power's back on,
but are we moving?

35
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,548
Do you feel like
we're moving?

36
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:26,065
And there's always something
to keep us busy.

37
00:01:26,147 --> 00:01:27,718
What?

38
00:01:28,168 --> 00:01:29,590
- It doesn't matter.
- Doesn't matter?

39
00:01:29,652 --> 00:01:32,025
I just mean that no one's asking
for anything from you.

40
00:01:32,107 --> 00:01:36,588
No one's asking for you
to give up anything or... anyone.

41
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:38,685
It's just you needed to know.
What?

42
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,015
Teddy's pregnant.

43
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:51,508
It's yours?

44
00:01:51,707 --> 00:01:53,842
We always know what to do next.

45
00:01:54,866 --> 00:01:55,954
Okay!

46
00:01:56,017 --> 00:01:57,105
It's a cozy little box.

47
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,798
I, uh, think we're stuck.

48
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,178
I can't be.
I have to be in surgery.

49
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:10,065
I have to procure
a heart for Cece.

50
00:02:10,147 --> 00:02:12,508
Maggie is waiting for us.

51
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,791
I can't be in here.

52
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:16,918
You got to get us
out of here.

53
00:02:18,647 --> 00:02:19,895
All right, uh...

54
00:02:19,977 --> 00:02:21,685
I have a transplant!

55
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:25,258
Okay.

56
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:26,565
What are you doing?

57
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:29,048
Well, under this
light fixture,

58
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:31,275
there should be
a trap door somewhere.

59
00:02:31,357 --> 00:02:32,629
What? No!

60
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:36,088
You're not doing
some action-hero crap

61
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:38,025
where you climb up
an elevator shaft.

62
00:02:38,107 --> 00:02:39,968
I meant use your phone.

63
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:42,455
- Well, I don't get any signal in here.
- Well, neither do I.

64
00:02:42,518 --> 00:02:44,718
Then why did you ask me
to get us out of here?

65
00:02:45,409 --> 00:02:46,685
Because I...

66
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:50,979
can't be in here!

67
00:02:52,358 --> 00:02:53,721
Help!

68
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:02,918
So, um, her spine,
then?

69
00:03:03,175 --> 00:03:05,565
Chondrosarcoma.

70
00:03:05,647 --> 00:03:06,798
C5 to T1.

71
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,975
Extensive local invasion.

72
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:12,178
When did she tell you?

73
00:03:12,279 --> 00:03:13,947
Why... Why did
she tell you?

74
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:15,292
She didn't.

75
00:03:15,698 --> 00:03:18,258
She doesn't want
anyone to know yet.

76
00:03:18,393 --> 00:03:20,675
But I couldn't know this
without telling you.

77
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,315
Especially you.

78
00:03:27,839 --> 00:03:29,418
What do I do?

79
00:03:29,663 --> 00:03:31,339
- I feel, uh...
- Helpless.

80
00:03:31,409 --> 00:03:32,975
I know.

81
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:37,105
I've never felt less
like a doctor in my life.

82
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,918
Oh, no.
My... My patient, Cece.

83
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,659
She's in the O.R.
Her pressure is dropping.

84
00:03:49,081 --> 00:03:50,495
Go.

85
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,225
Whatever I can do...
Go. Go.

86
00:04:05,948 --> 00:04:08,284
- Cece, what's going on?
- Her pressure keeps dropping.

87
00:04:08,362 --> 00:04:09,585
We started her
on pressors again.

88
00:04:09,647 --> 00:04:12,468
My old heart is jealous
of my new one.

89
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:14,508
It seems to want
to quit on me.

90
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:16,418
Well, then,
we're just in time.

91
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,395
Titrate the drip to keep
her MAPs above 50.

92
00:04:18,477 --> 00:04:19,718
Qadri, go to O.R. 2

93
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,375
and see how Dr. Bailey's doing
on the procurement.

94
00:04:21,437 --> 00:04:23,355
I need to know how far out we are.
Got it.

95
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,775
What do we do?

96
00:04:40,857 --> 00:04:42,178
What do we do?

97
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:44,145
We keep doing what
we're doing.

98
00:04:44,227 --> 00:04:45,548
You pump the bag.

99
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:48,895
Get the O2 in the blood,
keep the organs viable,

100
00:04:48,977 --> 00:04:51,798
and we... wait.

101
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,145
But we're trapped.

102
00:04:53,227 --> 00:04:56,319
- Not trapped, delayed.
- We can't be!

103
00:04:56,382 --> 00:04:58,795
Cece's in the O.R. right now.
We have to get these organs...

104
00:04:58,858 --> 00:05:00,748
- Helm, get your head together.
- It's just, uh,

105
00:05:00,811 --> 00:05:03,233
she's been waiting for this,
and she's, uh...

106
00:05:05,437 --> 00:05:08,678
God, I... I think I'm...

107
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,775
I think I'm having
a panic attack.

108
00:05:10,857 --> 00:05:12,298
No, no.

109
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,128
You're not.
S-Stop it.

110
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:15,435
Do you understand me?

111
00:05:15,517 --> 00:05:18,275
No one is having
a panic attack.

112
00:05:30,567 --> 00:05:33,145
Is anybody out there?!

You've been here since...

117

Weeks.
Weeks. For weeks.

118
00:05:43,895 --> 00:05:45,616
- Yeah, a long time.
- Did you just find out?

119
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:48,678
No, no. You knew.
That's why you came here.

120
00:05:48,741 --> 00:05:49,888
Because you were
pregnant, and you...

121
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:51,943
Yes, yes, I-I knew for a while.

122
00:05:52,006 --> 00:05:53,435
- and you didn't tell me?
- I did tell you.

123
00:05:53,498 --> 00:05:54,951
Just now!

124
00:05:55,755 --> 00:05:57,458
He's bottomed out.

125
00:05:58,415 --> 00:05:59,640
Uh, I don't feel a pulse.

126
00:05:59,703 --> 00:06:01,411
Maybe it's
a cardiac tamponade?

127
00:06:01,474 --> 00:06:03,538
Maybe the plate
punctured his heart.

128
00:06:03,601 --> 00:06:04,827
All right, well, if it has,
compressions aren't gonna help.

129
00:06:04,889 --> 00:06:05,978
We have got to
get him into an O.R.

130
00:06:07,141 --> 00:06:08,842
Hey! Hey!

131
00:06:09,066 --> 00:06:10,644
Guys, guys, guys,
we don't have time.

132
00:06:10,726 --> 00:06:11,851
Worst-case scenario
is the door won't open

133
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:12,984
till after he's dead.

134
00:06:13,066 --> 00:06:14,333
Yeah, we have to
open him up.

135
00:06:14,489 --> 00:06:15,801
- In here?
- In here.

136
00:06:15,887 --> 00:06:17,791
Look around and see what
we have to work with.

137
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:20,161
Uh, two units of extra blood.
Great, do we have a...

138
00:06:20,243 --> 00:06:22,144
- Test tube tray.
- Jackpot. I've got a scalpel.

139
00:06:22,226 --> 00:06:23,391
All right, Shepherd,
can you bag him, please?

140
00:06:23,453 --> 00:06:24,621
We're really doing this?

141
00:06:24,703 --> 00:06:26,024
Yes. Come on.

142
00:06:26,106 --> 00:06:27,863
Trauma is the choice
between doing something

143
00:06:27,926 --> 00:06:29,175
that could maybe
kill him...

144
00:06:29,238 --> 00:06:30,269
Or doing nothing...

145
00:06:30,332 --> 00:06:32,027
- which will really kill him.
- Which will really kill him.

146
00:06:32,243 --> 00:06:33,911
Hey, we're
not going anywhere,

147
00:06:33,993 --> 00:06:36,371
so what else
do we have to do?

148
00:06:41,226 --> 00:06:43,394
You're supposed to be
honeymooning.

149
00:06:43,476 --> 00:06:45,024
And you're supposed to be
sleeping.

150
00:06:45,106 --> 00:06:46,391
Look, they opened the bridge.

151
00:06:46,453 --> 00:06:47,854
The storm's calming down.

152
00:06:47,936 --> 00:06:49,604
- Come back to bed.
- Oh, come on, Jo.

153
00:06:49,686 --> 00:06:51,004
It's a basket of crap
over there.

154
00:06:51,067 --> 00:06:52,012
No, no, it's fine.

155
00:06:52,075 --> 00:06:53,441
- No, it's not fine.
- Mm, it is.

156
00:06:53,504 --> 00:06:55,276
A pole fell down in the ambulance bay.

157
00:06:55,387 --> 00:06:57,004
- You're kidding.
- No, no, no. The power went out.

158
00:06:57,066 --> 00:06:58,561
- The... The elevators aren't working.
- No.

159
00:06:58,623 --> 00:07:00,521
We've got doctors and we've
got patients trapped.

160
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:02,831
- Bailey will have...
- Bailey... trapped.

161
00:07:02,913 --> 00:07:04,387
On an elevator.

162
00:07:04,762 --> 00:07:06,410
- We should go.
- No, I should go.

163
00:07:06,473 --> 00:07:08,411
- You're drunk.
- Okay, you should go.

164
00:07:12,436 --> 00:07:13,725
Stop that.

165
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,854
Stop what?

166
00:07:15,997 --> 00:07:17,444
Looking at me.

167
00:07:17,526 --> 00:07:19,701
It's a small room.
There's not a lot to look at.

168
00:07:21,223 --> 00:07:22,961
You know what I mean.

169
00:07:23,043 --> 00:07:24,341
Okay.

170
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:26,934
I'll stand over here
where I can't look at you.

171
00:07:30,476 --> 00:07:32,394
I just hate not knowing

172
00:07:32,476 --> 00:07:33,944
what's going on
out there.

173
00:07:34,026 --> 00:07:35,431
I can tell you
what's going on out there...

174
00:07:35,494 --> 00:07:36,791
Maggie's probably
already started

175
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:38,201
on Cece's
heart transplant

176
00:07:38,283 --> 00:07:42,020
'cause Bailey or Webber
or literally anyone else

177
00:07:42,106 --> 00:07:43,331
already did
the organ recovery.

178
00:07:43,413 --> 00:07:46,524
And that same person is gonna do
the kidney transplant.

179
00:07:46,606 --> 00:07:48,541
You're a brilliant surgeon,
Meredith,

180
00:07:48,623 --> 00:07:52,331
but this procedure
only requires a surgeon.

181
00:07:52,413 --> 00:07:54,071
Thanks, I think.

182
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:58,226
Thank you.

183
00:08:03,932 --> 00:08:05,547
It's like the TARDIS
from "Doctor Who."

184
00:08:06,646 --> 00:08:09,201
It that some nerd thing?
Because I'm not fluent.

185
00:08:09,283 --> 00:08:10,564
No, I mean, me neither,

186
00:08:10,646 --> 00:08:13,001
but I used to watch it
when I was a kid in Italy.

187
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:15,394
"Doctor Who" had this,

188
00:08:15,476 --> 00:08:17,387
uh, phone booth
that was a time machine,

189
00:08:17,488 --> 00:08:19,656
and when you stepped inside,
you were, like,

190
00:08:19,746 --> 00:08:21,317
outside of time
and space.

191
00:08:21,559 --> 00:08:22,751
And the world went on,

192
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:26,973
but you were in this whole other
little... bubble...

193
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:30,425
A secret place where
the normal rules don't apply.

194
00:08:38,949 --> 00:08:40,827
The rule still apply.

195
00:08:41,066 --> 00:08:42,621
This isn't the Turdis.

196
00:08:42,703 --> 00:08:43,815
TARDIS.

197
00:08:43,897 --> 00:08:45,774
Whatever.

198
00:08:45,856 --> 00:08:47,161
Call the Fire Department

199
00:08:47,243 --> 00:08:49,394
and have them get those
elevators open!

200
00:08:49,476 --> 00:08:51,484
- They're not coming.
- They're not coming?

201
00:08:51,566 --> 00:08:53,435
They're on limited operations
because of the storm.

202
00:08:53,497 --> 00:08:55,268
Look, I don't know
why you're yelling at me.

203
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:57,244
Because the damn building
isn't working,

204
00:08:57,307 --> 00:08:59,001
and you're in charge
of the damn building!

205
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:00,356
Do better!

206
00:09:09,686 --> 00:09:10,931
This is Catherine Fox.

207
00:09:10,993 --> 00:09:11,912
Please leave a message.

208
00:09:13,043 --> 00:09:14,425
Uh...

209
00:09:14,936 --> 00:09:16,909
Y-Y-You're Betty, right?

210
00:09:16,972 --> 00:09:19,144
You need some help to find someone?
Oh, no. That's okay.

211
00:09:19,206 --> 00:09:21,391
I was just waiting
for Dr. Shepherd to get back.

212
00:09:21,623 --> 00:09:24,393
I just got a bit restless,
you know, in the E.R.

213
00:09:24,474 --> 00:09:26,012
Right, right.

214
00:09:29,856 --> 00:09:30,984
Um, you know what?

215
00:09:31,066 --> 00:09:32,564
I'm little bit
antsy myself.

216
00:09:32,646 --> 00:09:33,931
I mean, I find
the best thing to do

217
00:09:33,993 --> 00:09:35,684
is to help someone else.

218
00:09:35,766 --> 00:09:37,024
Got a lot of patients here

219
00:09:37,106 --> 00:09:38,734
and none of the elevators
are working.

220
00:09:38,816 --> 00:09:41,021
I need to stay busy, and so do you.
That's okay. I can just...

221
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:42,821
Now, come on.
Let's make ourselves useful.

222
00:09:46,226 --> 00:09:47,331
<i>This is Catherine Fox.</i>

223
00:09:47,413 --> 00:09:49,143
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

224
00:09:49,292 --> 00:09:51,281
Mom, it's me again.
Call me, all right?

225
00:09:51,356 --> 00:09:52,794
Tell me where you are
and what I can do to help.

226
00:09:52,856 --> 00:09:53,831
Do you know where
Dr. Bailey is?!

227
00:09:53,913 --> 00:09:55,314
Qadri, what is going on?

228
00:09:55,396 --> 00:09:56,911
Dr. Bailey
is in an elevator.

229
00:09:56,993 --> 00:09:58,684
You just asked me
where she is.

230
00:09:58,766 --> 00:10:00,894
Cece Colvin's on the table
for a transplant.

231
00:10:00,976 --> 00:10:03,314
Dr. Bailey is stuck in an
elevator with the donor organs.

232
00:10:03,396 --> 00:10:04,354
Dr. Pierce wants me
to find them,

233
00:10:04,436 --> 00:10:05,481
but I don't know how
I'm gonna do that.

234
00:10:05,543 --> 00:10:06,894
- Coming through.
- Hey!

235
00:10:06,976 --> 00:10:08,566
What? The elevators...
I need you to open them up.

236
00:10:08,628 --> 00:10:10,481
- I can't. The elevators are down.
- I know that.

237
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:13,198
They're computerized, okay?
So they need a while to reset.

238
00:10:13,261 --> 00:10:15,141
- They'll be back up eventually.
- We don't have till "eventually."

239
00:10:15,203 --> 00:10:16,449
I'm asking you
how they get opened.

240
00:10:16,511 --> 00:10:18,838
Well, I'd call the elevator guy,
but he's not coming.

241
00:10:18,901 --> 00:10:19,981
You know, there's
a hell of a storm out there.

242
00:10:20,043 --> 00:10:22,174
Yes, I r...
Is there anything by chance

243
00:10:22,237 --> 00:10:23,269
that you know
that I don't?

244
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:24,814
Oh!

245
00:10:24,896 --> 00:10:26,684
Okay, Doctor.
No, I don't know.

246
00:10:26,747 --> 00:10:29,239
Can you tell me how many ground
fault circuit interrupters it takes

247
00:10:29,301 --> 00:10:30,270
to keep you
from getting fried

248
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:31,851
every time you reach
for a defibrillator?

249
00:10:31,913 --> 00:10:33,394
No, you can't.

250
00:10:33,476 --> 00:10:34,961
You just pick it up
and say, "Clear!"

251
00:10:35,043 --> 00:10:36,854
and somehow you're a hero.

252
00:10:36,936 --> 00:10:38,461
'Cause doctors are so cool.

253
00:10:43,606 --> 00:10:44,894
Don't hyperventilate.

254
00:10:44,976 --> 00:10:46,234
I'm not. I'm okay.

255
00:10:46,316 --> 00:10:48,581
Don't hyperventilate
the patient.

256
00:10:48,663 --> 00:10:49,894
Oh, sorry.

257
00:10:51,663 --> 00:10:54,581
I just, uh, think
we're gonna plummet

258
00:10:54,663 --> 00:10:57,484
and, uh, Cece will die

259
00:10:57,566 --> 00:11:00,394
and Phoebe never got a chance
to say goodbye to her mother,

260
00:11:00,476 --> 00:11:02,234
and she would have died
for nothing...

261
00:11:02,316 --> 00:11:03,834
With a stupid selfie stick
in her face...

262
00:11:03,896 --> 00:11:04,832
And this thing's
gonna plummet

263
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:05,911
and we're gonna
plummet with it!

264
00:11:05,974 --> 00:11:07,552
They say if you jump
as it hits the ground,

265
00:11:07,614 --> 00:11:09,374
- we might be okay, but...
- That's nonsense.

266
00:11:09,526 --> 00:11:11,961
It's basic physics. You can't... Right.

267
00:11:12,043 --> 00:11:14,814
First... First,
we'll hit the ceiling,

268
00:11:14,896 --> 00:11:18,574
and then we'll smash into
the floor like tomatoes.

269
00:11:18,637 --> 00:11:20,668
We'll just be
a puddle of us.

270
00:11:20,731 --> 00:11:21,411
Nobody's plummeting.

271
00:11:21,512 --> 00:11:24,163
These things plummet
all the time.

272
00:11:24,226 --> 00:11:26,354
In movies,
not in buildings.

273
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:27,422
Do you know that?

274
00:11:27,485 --> 00:11:30,148
There's special brakes
and things.

275
00:11:30,211 --> 00:11:31,117
How... How do you
know that?

276
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:32,684
I don't know that!
I made it up.

277
00:11:32,766 --> 00:11:35,251
'Cause if our brains are
determined to scare us to death

278
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:37,961
with made-up scenarios where
everyone we care about dies

279
00:11:38,043 --> 00:11:40,274
and we are turned
into tomato sauce,

280
00:11:40,356 --> 00:11:42,944
then why can't they
also make us feel good

281
00:11:43,026 --> 00:11:44,251
about made-up good things?

282
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:46,213
Like, uh,
hydraulic air brakes.

283
00:11:46,276 --> 00:11:48,734
And stop inflating
that woman!

284
00:11:54,646 --> 00:11:58,644
What if we, uh...
We all breathe together?

285
00:11:58,726 --> 00:12:00,251
Okay?

286
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:02,541
Should, uh...
Should we do that?

287
00:12:03,095 --> 00:12:04,151
In.

288
00:12:06,543 --> 00:12:09,144
And out.

289
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:12,814
In.

290
00:12:14,873 --> 00:12:17,184
And out.

291
00:12:20,226 --> 00:12:21,561
I
was gonna tell you sooner.

292
00:12:21,623 --> 00:12:23,501
I was gonna tell you
the night that I got here,

293
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:26,041
but you had already
started a family.

294
00:12:26,566 --> 00:12:28,184
- In record time.
- Nice.

295
00:12:28,457 --> 00:12:30,184
Well, is it not true?

296
00:12:30,266 --> 00:12:31,582
It was a little snarky.

297
00:12:31,675 --> 00:12:33,064
Decompressing
the pericardium.

298
00:12:35,493 --> 00:12:37,074
I'm sorry.

299
00:12:37,191 --> 00:12:39,316
I-I-It was a little snarky.
You're right.

300
00:12:39,441 --> 00:12:40,863
- This is a clamshell.
- Mm-hmm. - Yes,

301
00:12:40,925 --> 00:12:42,996
it is a total clam...

302
00:12:43,902 --> 00:12:45,403
- is that like a cluster...
- I can't see

303
00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:46,574
where the bleeding
is coming from.

304
00:12:46,636 --> 00:12:49,058
Yeah, the incision...
We do a clamshell incision.

305
00:12:49,121 --> 00:12:50,356
- We need more visibility.
- Right.

306
00:12:50,418 --> 00:12:51,644
Yes. I knew that.

307
00:12:51,726 --> 00:12:53,816
I've just been very specialized

308
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:55,512
- for a very long time.
- It basically means we, uh,

309
00:12:55,574 --> 00:12:56,690
pop his chest like
the hood of a car.

310
00:12:56,752 --> 00:12:57,978
All right, Owen, uh,
grab the scalpel...

311
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,571
We'll do the right thoracotomy.
Yep.

312
00:12:59,816 --> 00:13:02,081
We're gonna need to find
something to crack that sternum.

313
00:13:02,163 --> 00:13:04,796
Yeah, I'm thinking
I'll, uh, figure it out.

314
00:13:06,177 --> 00:13:09,093
And so Carina stayed back
with my father,

315
00:13:09,242 --> 00:13:10,975
and I moved out here
with my mom.

316
00:13:13,766 --> 00:13:15,022
Why did your mom leave?

317
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:17,394
I... My dad is, uh...

318
00:13:17,476 --> 00:13:20,804
Was a pretty famous surgeon
back in Italy.

319
00:13:22,856 --> 00:13:24,587
Wow.

320
00:13:25,073 --> 00:13:26,451
I wouldn't know anything

321
00:13:26,526 --> 00:13:27,681
about having
famous surgeon parents.

322
00:13:29,173 --> 00:13:30,604
You wouldn't.

323
00:13:30,686 --> 00:13:31,783
Your mom got awards.

324
00:13:31,853 --> 00:13:33,911
My dad got... acquittals.

325
00:13:42,316 --> 00:13:44,661
I've never really
told anyone about him.

326
00:13:47,816 --> 00:13:51,564
Oh, well...
you can if you want to.

327
00:13:51,744 --> 00:13:53,184
I don't think that I do.

328
00:13:53,266 --> 00:13:55,411
I mean, I just meant that
you could if you wanted to

329
00:13:55,493 --> 00:13:56,911
and it wouldn't leave
this room.

330
00:13:58,564 --> 00:14:00,701
Because I don't think
we're ever leaving this room.

331
00:14:08,606 --> 00:14:10,751
<i>Speaking Italian...</i>

332
00:14:33,763 --> 00:14:35,619
But he's also the man

333
00:14:35,712 --> 00:14:38,274
who took me on the back
of his motorbike

334
00:14:38,356 --> 00:14:40,944
and taught me
how to kick a soccer ball,

335
00:14:41,026 --> 00:14:43,041
taught me the names
of the stars.

336
00:14:43,123 --> 00:14:45,411
So, it's complicated.

337
00:14:48,766 --> 00:14:51,371
There. I told somebody.

338
00:14:54,726 --> 00:14:56,225
Thanks.

339
00:15:08,003 --> 00:15:10,019
Do you really think there's
a trap door up there?

340
00:15:20,792 --> 00:15:21,920
Uh...

341
00:15:21,983 --> 00:15:24,067
I just came in here to
get out of the wind.

342
00:15:25,035 --> 00:15:26,500
- Same.
- Same.

343
00:15:27,667 --> 00:15:30,686
Well, I should
get back in there.

344
00:15:33,957 --> 00:15:36,142
And you should get back
in there, too!

345
00:15:36,205 --> 00:15:37,226
Now!

346
00:15:37,289 --> 00:15:39,085
Yep.
Yes, sir.

347
00:15:42,231 --> 00:15:43,270
Done.

348
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:44,779
All right. How are we
gonna crack the sternum?

349
00:15:44,841 --> 00:15:47,073
I got that. We're gonna lose
that heart monitor.

350
00:15:47,136 --> 00:15:48,255
- Why?
- Why?

351
00:15:48,355 --> 00:15:50,833
To crack the sternum,
I usually use a Lebsche knife

352
00:15:50,997 --> 00:15:51,981
and hit it with a mallet.

353
00:15:52,044 --> 00:15:54,801
But we don't have either,
and that battery

354
00:15:54,864 --> 00:15:57,292
is heavy enough
to use as a mallet.

355
00:15:57,374 --> 00:15:59,042
And the Lebsche knife?

356
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:02,079
I'm gonna need you to put
pressure right there

357
00:16:02,141 --> 00:16:04,333
- when I pull this out.
- You're gonna use the license plate?

358
00:16:04,395 --> 00:16:06,693
Fun.
Great idea, Hunt.

359
00:16:06,843 --> 00:16:08,261
Okay. Ready?

360
00:16:08,391 --> 00:16:10,864
1... 2... 3!

361
00:16:10,944 --> 00:16:12,249
Aah!

362
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:14,926
Okay.

363
00:16:16,269 --> 00:16:19,356
So, what did you mean...

364
00:16:19,787 --> 00:16:21,632
What did you mean
when you said

365
00:16:21,801 --> 00:16:23,389
"Nobody wants me
to do anything"?

366
00:16:24,419 --> 00:16:25,950
Do you think maybe

367
00:16:26,024 --> 00:16:27,790
we might want to wait to talk
about that until we're...

368
00:16:27,852 --> 00:16:29,070
No, no.
I'm - I'm...

369
00:16:29,241 --> 00:16:30,762
I'm interested, too.

370
00:16:30,954 --> 00:16:32,631
Is he supposed
to choose now or...?

371
00:16:32,693 --> 00:16:34,174
No!
No, no, no.

372
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,128
There...
There is no choice.

373
00:16:36,257 --> 00:16:38,272
Owen, you and I
are off the table.

374
00:16:38,335 --> 00:16:41,950
So you and Amelia can just...
be whatever you want.

375
00:16:42,074 --> 00:16:43,509
Hey, thanks.

376
00:16:43,591 --> 00:16:45,162
But I am gonna stay
in Seattle.

377
00:16:45,244 --> 00:16:46,889
I mean, my child
deserves two parents,

378
00:16:46,971 --> 00:16:48,429
and I deserve my friend.

379
00:16:48,511 --> 00:16:51,559
And so you can
stay with Amelia.

380
00:16:51,641 --> 00:16:53,301
Who is right here.

381
00:16:53,664 --> 00:16:55,856
- Okay. You ready to go?
- Yes.

382
00:16:56,088 --> 00:16:57,313
Oh!

383
00:16:57,457 --> 00:16:58,738
Oh, God!
Wow.

384
00:16:58,954 --> 00:17:00,349
Great.

385
00:17:02,888 --> 00:17:04,999
Okay.
Here you go.

386
00:17:05,374 --> 00:17:06,809
Ready?
Get ready.

387
00:17:06,891 --> 00:17:08,832
1, 2, 3.

388
00:17:08,914 --> 00:17:09,889
All right.

389
00:17:09,971 --> 00:17:11,412
Oh, I love brain surgery.

390
00:17:11,494 --> 00:17:13,582
Okay. All right,
the left heart looks good.

391
00:17:13,664 --> 00:17:15,445
Sometimes,
there's only like a teaspoon of blood.

392
00:17:15,507 --> 00:17:18,491
I feel like, if I can
get clean for like three months,

393
00:17:18,658 --> 00:17:20,553
then I can get it
under control, you know?

394
00:17:20,616 --> 00:17:22,784
Get Leo back.
Just sort of get my life back.

395
00:17:22,847 --> 00:17:25,958
Betty, just take it
one day at a time,

396
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:28,444
and don't ever make the mistake
of thinking you're cured.

397
00:17:28,719 --> 00:17:30,160
That sucks.

398
00:17:30,297 --> 00:17:31,965
If you do it alone,
it sucks.

399
00:17:32,054 --> 00:17:34,609
But if you let people help you,
it's not bad at all.

400
00:17:37,675 --> 00:17:39,183
Ah, I've got
a patient coding.

401
00:17:39,279 --> 00:17:41,654
- Can you... That's cool.
- Can I go back to the E.R.?

402
00:17:41,717 --> 00:17:43,469
Just see what else
I can do?

403
00:17:43,732 --> 00:17:45,573
Yeah, you do that. Mm.

404
00:17:53,204 --> 00:17:54,582
Hello?

405
00:17:54,664 --> 00:17:55,809
- Hello?
- Hello?

406
00:17:55,889 --> 00:17:57,840
Anybody there?

407
00:17:57,914 --> 00:17:59,332
- You good?
- Shh.

408
00:17:59,414 --> 00:18:00,333
Hello? Hey!

409
00:18:00,415 --> 00:18:01,469
- Hello!
- In here!

410
00:18:01,551 --> 00:18:02,702
Great! They're in here!

411
00:18:02,765 --> 00:18:03,989
There are transplant organs
trapped in this elevator.

412
00:18:04,051 --> 00:18:06,009
Give us a hand.
Let's get this open.

413
00:18:07,922 --> 00:18:09,260
Whoa, hey, hey!

414
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:10,779
What do you guys
think you're doing?

415
00:18:10,841 --> 00:18:11,987
- Trying to get this open.
- No, no, no.

416
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:14,288
You can't access
a stalled elevator car.

417
00:18:14,351 --> 00:18:15,225
Someone can get killed.

418
00:18:15,288 --> 00:18:16,492
If we don't, someone
will get killed.

419
00:18:16,554 --> 00:18:17,848
How the hell do
we open this thing?

420
00:18:20,954 --> 00:18:22,162
Look out.

421
00:18:22,244 --> 00:18:23,360
Don't do that.

422
00:18:23,431 --> 00:18:24,559
No.
No, no, no, no!

423
00:18:24,744 --> 00:18:27,162
Aw, come on! Can you see that?

424
00:18:27,244 --> 00:18:28,682
You guys just do whatever you want.

425
00:18:28,744 --> 00:18:29,869
You got no respect
for the facility.

426
00:18:29,931 --> 00:18:31,122
Hey, listen to me,
all right?

427
00:18:31,204 --> 00:18:32,829
You want to be a hero?
You want to save lives?

428
00:18:32,891 --> 00:18:34,182
There's a woman
whose life depends

429
00:18:34,244 --> 00:18:35,829
on you getting that door open
for us right now.

430
00:18:35,891 --> 00:18:37,222
- I can't do that.
- I'm useless here.

431
00:18:37,284 --> 00:18:38,449
You're
gonna help me do it.

432
00:18:38,511 --> 00:18:39,642
We're gonna
get Cece her organs,

433
00:18:39,704 --> 00:18:40,789
or you're gonna wake up
tomorrow without a job.

434
00:18:40,851 --> 00:18:41,889
Whoa, hold on a second.

435
00:18:41,971 --> 00:18:43,814
Cece the...
The matchmaker lady, Cece?

436
00:18:43,877 --> 00:18:44,400
- Yes.
- Yes.

437
00:18:44,463 --> 00:18:46,497
Oh, she...
I-I was in her room

438
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,365
for just like 15 minutes once
fixing her TV,

439
00:18:48,428 --> 00:18:50,658
and she sized me up
and introduced me

440
00:18:50,721 --> 00:18:52,452
to a nurse
down in critical care.

441
00:18:52,534 --> 00:18:53,992
We've been together
ever since.

442
00:18:54,074 --> 00:18:55,469
She changed my life,
that lady.

443
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:58,332
She, uh, put, uh,
joy in my life.

444
00:18:58,414 --> 00:19:00,166
Pardon me.
May I borrow this?

445
00:19:01,914 --> 00:19:03,650
That guy
has joy in his life?

446
00:19:03,713 --> 00:19:05,614
Or maybe her name is Joy?

447
00:19:05,794 --> 00:19:07,519
It's not coming.

448
00:19:07,758 --> 00:19:08,780
Watch out.

449
00:19:14,374 --> 00:19:15,180
There we go.

450
00:19:19,914 --> 00:19:22,179
- Come on! You got this.
- You got this! That's it!

451
00:19:25,784 --> 00:19:27,369
It's like "Lord of the friggin'
Flies" in here.

452
00:19:27,431 --> 00:19:29,239
What happened? Bailey's in
there with donor organs.

453
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:30,389
They're for Cece.

454
00:19:35,932 --> 00:19:37,202
Hey.

455
00:19:37,284 --> 00:19:38,992
Karev.

456
00:19:39,074 --> 00:19:40,162
Welcome.

457
00:19:41,624 --> 00:19:43,832
 This is the last
unit of blood.

458
00:19:43,914 --> 00:19:45,489
Do you want me to take over?
I got it. Thanks.

459
00:19:48,051 --> 00:19:49,416
How long?

460
00:19:49,665 --> 00:19:51,793
Oh, I'd say about
five more minutes

461
00:19:51,954 --> 00:19:53,739
with this unit of blood
unless the door opens.

462
00:19:53,801 --> 00:19:55,139
How far along are you?

463
00:19:58,301 --> 00:20:00,127
16 weeks.

464
00:20:00,353 --> 00:20:01,979
And did...
Have you had...

465
00:20:02,042 --> 00:20:03,948
Have you been
to appointments or...?

466
00:20:04,011 --> 00:20:07,166
Yes, we're... we're fine.

467
00:20:07,431 --> 00:20:10,377
Baby's fine.
I'm fine.

468
00:20:10,839 --> 00:20:12,574
So, you know if it's a...

469
00:20:12,734 --> 00:20:15,658
No. Not yet.

470
00:20:22,834 --> 00:20:24,529
I'm so sorry.
I should have told you soon...

471
00:20:24,591 --> 00:20:25,662
You think?

472
00:20:25,744 --> 00:20:26,912
This is not the way...

473
00:20:26,994 --> 00:20:28,241
Do you think that
this is the way

474
00:20:28,303 --> 00:20:29,299
- I wanted to do this?
- I-I-I don't know.

475
00:20:29,362 --> 00:20:31,309
I don't know. You seem to
know what everybody wants.

476
00:20:32,562 --> 00:20:34,633
Do you feel anything?

477
00:20:34,766 --> 00:20:36,729
There should be, like,
a-a handle or something.

478
00:20:36,792 --> 00:20:38,221
It might be a keyhole.

479
00:20:38,346 --> 00:20:39,821
Like, it feels like
I need a key.

480
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:41,708
Damn it.

481
00:20:45,704 --> 00:20:48,582
Remind me again why this
is such a bad idea for us.

482
00:20:48,645 --> 00:20:50,095
Because it's a bad idea.

483
00:20:50,158 --> 00:20:52,599
No, I hear you.
I'm just asking why.

484
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:55,765
Because I'm an attending,
and you're a resident.

485
00:20:55,948 --> 00:20:58,269
And that happens
all the time.

486
00:20:58,332 --> 00:21:00,353
It's happened for you,
I think.

487
00:21:00,616 --> 00:21:03,665
Well, I'm trying to learn
from my mistakes.

488
00:21:03,749 --> 00:21:06,238
I promise not to tell your kids
that you called them that.

489
00:21:07,627 --> 00:21:10,112
My marriage and my kids
aren't a mistake.

490
00:21:12,028 --> 00:21:13,953
Then what are you
learning exactly?

491
00:21:16,498 --> 00:21:18,003
I don't know.

492
00:21:20,556 --> 00:21:22,673
Just go back to
speaking Italian.

493
00:21:22,923 --> 00:21:24,736
I liked it better.

494
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:29,847
<i>Speaking Italian...</i>

495
00:21:37,494 --> 00:21:41,589
<i>Speaking Italian...</i>

496
00:21:47,421 --> 00:21:49,000
Wow.

497
00:21:49,735 --> 00:21:51,334
Yeah.

498
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:09,174
I was the one who said
let's talk about this later

499
00:22:09,236 --> 00:22:11,321
- so that you didn't have to do this now...
- Well, I have a stake in this.

500
00:22:11,383 --> 00:22:13,012
- I have children here, too. We do.
- I know. I know.

501
00:22:13,074 --> 00:22:15,123
- I have children. We both do.
- I understand that. I know, I just...

502
00:22:15,185 --> 00:22:16,153
Can we all just...

503
00:22:19,721 --> 00:22:21,139
Let's go! Let's go!
Let's go!

504
00:22:23,334 --> 00:22:25,059
Watch out.
All right, great.

505
00:22:25,141 --> 00:22:26,889
Coming through!

506
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,378
All right, you're next.
Uh...

507
00:22:34,704 --> 00:22:36,059
What if,
when I'm halfway through,

508
00:22:36,141 --> 00:22:38,009
it plummets
and chops me in half?

509
00:22:38,091 --> 00:22:39,752
Helm!
Come get this patient

510
00:22:39,834 --> 00:22:41,769
and her life-giving
organs to the O.R.

511
00:22:41,851 --> 00:22:44,629
Yes, ma'am.

512
00:22:48,164 --> 00:22:50,622
All right.
Let's get her to O.R. 2.

513
00:22:50,704 --> 00:22:51,909
Uh, we need some help
with the stairs.

514
00:22:51,971 --> 00:22:52,890
- Yeah, we got it.
- Ow.

515
00:22:52,972 --> 00:22:54,412
Oh, hey.

516
00:22:54,494 --> 00:22:55,542
Ooh.
We got you.

517
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:56,659
No, I'm good. I'm good.
I'm good.

518
00:22:56,721 --> 00:22:58,889
Go help Cece. Go!

519
00:23:01,721 --> 00:23:02,752
Oh, God!

520
00:23:02,834 --> 00:23:04,009
No, no, no, no!

521
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:05,542
Oh, God! Oh, God!

522
00:23:09,963 --> 00:23:11,266
Hit the button! Hit it!

523
00:23:21,487 --> 00:23:22,766
Is it bad?

524
00:23:22,828 --> 00:23:24,390
Are they gone?

525
00:23:24,535 --> 00:23:25,554
We got you, Jed.

526
00:23:25,677 --> 00:23:27,334
We got you, buddy.
Okay?

527
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:30,703
What is the deal
with this elevator?

528
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:32,438
I'm screwed.
I'm getting fired.

529
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:35,225
Barely been here, and this is my
first impression on the Chief.

530
00:23:35,288 --> 00:23:36,974
Please, I've been making
impressions for months,

531
00:23:37,036 --> 00:23:38,664
and they're all
this bad or worse.

532
00:23:38,758 --> 00:23:39,999
I am getting fired.

533
00:23:48,531 --> 00:23:50,466
This is not a good sign.

534
00:23:50,548 --> 00:23:52,539
Mnh. Mnh-mnh.

535
00:23:54,411 --> 00:23:56,289
Let's start her
on some norepi.

536
00:23:56,472 --> 00:23:58,720
It's getting
cold in here.

537
00:23:58,951 --> 00:24:00,636
Shouldn't we
be getting started?

538
00:24:00,787 --> 00:24:02,945
Not much longer, okay?

539
00:24:06,081 --> 00:24:08,806
How's Dr. Avery?

540
00:24:09,421 --> 00:24:10,739
Cece.

541
00:24:10,821 --> 00:24:14,203
Maggie,
this is not normal.

542
00:24:15,741 --> 00:24:18,851
I have received
organs before.

543
00:24:19,154 --> 00:24:20,835
And this is not
a normal amount of time

544
00:24:20,898 --> 00:24:22,993
to wait in an O.R.

545
00:24:24,622 --> 00:24:26,387
There's a problem.

546
00:24:29,422 --> 00:24:31,643
And I'm frightened.

547
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:35,391
Because
I've loved this life,

548
00:24:36,795 --> 00:24:40,579
and I don't know for sure
what's next.

549
00:24:42,621 --> 00:24:44,688
I'm frightened.

550
00:24:45,711 --> 00:24:47,899
It might help me

551
00:24:48,241 --> 00:24:50,907
to be a little less
frightened

552
00:24:51,411 --> 00:24:54,633
if you talked to me
about you and Dr. Avery.

553
00:24:54,968 --> 00:24:57,719
Okay. Okay.

554
00:24:58,141 --> 00:25:00,547
Dr. Avery and I are
kind of a mess right now.

555
00:25:00,676 --> 00:25:03,258
We had a big fight,
and, um,

556
00:25:03,451 --> 00:25:05,636
I don't really know
where we stand.

557
00:25:06,266 --> 00:25:07,579
I feel like he could...

558
00:25:07,661 --> 00:25:10,949
I feel like we could
fall apart at any minute.

559
00:25:11,031 --> 00:25:12,176
I don't think I'm...

560
00:25:12,258 --> 00:25:14,086
You don't feel safe.

561
00:25:14,338 --> 00:25:15,696
Mm-hmm.

562
00:25:16,072 --> 00:25:17,235
Yeah.

563
00:25:17,491 --> 00:25:19,739
In my experience,

564
00:25:19,915 --> 00:25:22,477
that means
one of two things...

565
00:25:23,338 --> 00:25:27,352
Either he is terrible
for you

566
00:25:27,813 --> 00:25:29,861
or he's so good for you,

567
00:25:29,928 --> 00:25:32,477
you're scared
you'll lose him.

568
00:25:32,748 --> 00:25:36,157
Was there ever a time
he made you feel safe?

569
00:25:40,271 --> 00:25:41,987
When my mother died.

570
00:25:45,704 --> 00:25:47,667
That's a good time
to do it.

571
00:25:47,768 --> 00:25:49,854
Yeah.

572
00:25:52,508 --> 00:25:53,869
Cece, no! No!

573
00:25:53,951 --> 00:25:56,221
Crash cart!
And tube her. Now!

574
00:25:57,135 --> 00:25:58,729
I had panic attacks
as a kid.

575
00:25:58,857 --> 00:26:01,026
Before dance recitals.
And... And spelling bees.

576
00:26:01,089 --> 00:26:03,893
But, also, I-I really thought
that elevator was gonna plummet.

577
00:26:03,956 --> 00:26:05,216
I need you to stop!

578
00:26:07,121 --> 00:26:08,925
Good. You're here.

579
00:26:08,988 --> 00:26:10,077
What is it, Karev?

580
00:26:10,155 --> 00:26:11,551
We need to get the maintenance
guy down to the O.R.

581
00:26:11,613 --> 00:26:13,776
- The maintenance guy, why?
- Elevator nearly took his legs off.

582
00:26:13,838 --> 00:26:15,119
- I knew it!
- No.

583
00:26:15,201 --> 00:26:16,886
Uh, I'll go find an O.R.
for him.

584
00:26:16,956 --> 00:26:18,003
You come do this for me.

585
00:26:18,066 --> 00:26:19,682
You want me to do
an organ recovery?

586
00:26:19,745 --> 00:26:21,933
You can perform an organ
recovery, can you not?

587
00:26:22,019 --> 00:26:23,018
Yeah, but you're
already doing it.

588
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:24,050
I need to get to the E.R.

589
00:26:24,113 --> 00:26:25,198
I need...
I need to do that.

590
00:26:25,261 --> 00:26:27,062
Look, I'll look after
the hospital, Dr. Karev.

591
00:26:27,167 --> 00:26:28,886
Go scrub and get in here.

592
00:26:39,241 --> 00:26:40,739
Okay, and we're good.

593
00:26:40,821 --> 00:26:42,156
- Flow is good.
- Let's isolate.

594
00:26:42,218 --> 00:26:43,620
I've isolated the injury.

595
00:26:43,683 --> 00:26:45,159
I need a 4-0 prolene,
please.

596
00:26:45,241 --> 00:26:46,486
Uh, do you think
we should do a graft or...?

597
00:26:46,548 --> 00:26:47,909
What can I do?

598
00:26:47,991 --> 00:26:50,426
Uh... I think...
I think we're good.

599
00:26:56,321 --> 00:26:57,950
Uh...

600
00:27:01,741 --> 00:27:03,369
- How's she doing?
- Not good.

601
00:27:03,451 --> 00:27:05,276
We've shocked her twice,
but we can't put her on bypass

602
00:27:05,338 --> 00:27:07,156
- until we have organs.
- Bailey's already started.

603
00:27:07,218 --> 00:27:08,320
Scalpel.

604
00:27:15,081 --> 00:27:16,909
There's extensive
tissue damage,

605
00:27:16,991 --> 00:27:18,276
but the nerves here
look salvageable.

606
00:27:18,338 --> 00:27:20,386
Yeah, this left femur
is looking gnarly.

607
00:27:20,468 --> 00:27:23,346
But the right... The right
looks like maybe an ex-fix.

608
00:27:23,428 --> 00:27:25,216
- Where have you been?
- I, uh...

609
00:27:25,298 --> 00:27:27,156
He was blown in
the ambulance bay.

610
00:27:27,293 --> 00:27:29,062
The wind threw him
into an ambulance.

611
00:27:29,125 --> 00:27:31,039
It was bad.
You okay to work?

612
00:27:31,102 --> 00:27:31,869
- Yes.
- Yes.

613
00:27:31,951 --> 00:27:33,276
Yeah, we'll definitely
take the left.

614
00:27:33,338 --> 00:27:34,516
Jury's out on the right.

615
00:27:34,598 --> 00:27:36,079
What if we don't
take either?

616
00:27:36,161 --> 00:27:37,846
Dude,
this leg is a no-go.

617
00:27:37,928 --> 00:27:39,449
It's crushed musculature,

618
00:27:39,531 --> 00:27:41,329
open comminuted
femur fracture,

619
00:27:41,411 --> 00:27:43,096
a hashed neurovascular
bundle.

620
00:27:43,178 --> 00:27:45,949
We should amputate...
Dude, place some rods.

621
00:27:46,031 --> 00:27:47,596
- What?
- Or a plate or an ex-fix.

622
00:27:47,678 --> 00:27:48,869
I mean, fix the legs.

623
00:27:48,951 --> 00:27:49,986
Okay, yeah, the nerves
are crushed,

624
00:27:50,048 --> 00:27:51,829
but they're still
intact, right?

625
00:27:51,911 --> 00:27:53,449
I could do an arterial
anastomosis.

626
00:27:53,531 --> 00:27:54,679
I can get some
blood flow in there.

627
00:27:54,741 --> 00:27:56,036
He'll have a better outcome
with a prosthesis.

628
00:27:56,098 --> 00:27:57,369
Please tell me
you know that.

629
00:27:57,451 --> 00:27:59,131
I know that he's here
because of a patient.

630
00:27:59,201 --> 00:28:00,176
I know that he did
everything he could

631
00:28:00,258 --> 00:28:01,739
so that she could survive.

632
00:28:01,821 --> 00:28:03,699
I want to save his leg.
I can do that.

633
00:28:03,781 --> 00:28:06,036
Well, maybe you can, but that
doesn't mean that you should.

634
00:28:06,098 --> 00:28:07,716
Even if you save
the blood supply,

635
00:28:07,798 --> 00:28:09,094
if he doesn't regain
function...

636
00:28:09,157 --> 00:28:10,609
Doctor, if you're not
gonna fix his femurs,

637
00:28:10,671 --> 00:28:12,839
then maybe your fellow
can give it a shot, huh?

638
00:28:21,911 --> 00:28:23,528
All right.

639
00:28:23,741 --> 00:28:25,199
It's metal shop.
I want plates.

640
00:28:25,281 --> 00:28:26,326
I want the modular
rod tray open.

641
00:28:26,388 --> 00:28:27,469
Schmitt, give me
some suction here.

642
00:28:27,531 --> 00:28:28,656
And some large Weber clamps,
a large lobster claw...

643
00:28:28,718 --> 00:28:29,659
I need curved
micro scissors

644
00:28:29,741 --> 00:28:30,716
and, uh,
jeweler's forceps, please.

645
00:28:30,798 --> 00:28:31,846
Keep an eye on his MAPs,

646
00:28:31,928 --> 00:28:34,119
and I want a strict
urine output

647
00:28:34,201 --> 00:28:38,145
and make sure that
there's a vigileo in his ICU.

648
00:28:40,081 --> 00:28:41,731
He's gonna want
that license plate.

649
00:28:41,794 --> 00:28:44,028
That's a keeper.

650
00:28:45,821 --> 00:28:48,046
So, uh, you're...

651
00:28:50,121 --> 00:28:52,778
You want me to be involved?

652
00:28:53,934 --> 00:28:56,035
With the baby?

653
00:28:56,678 --> 00:28:58,176
Yes.

654
00:29:03,121 --> 00:29:05,465
Because I want
to be involved.

655
00:29:06,013 --> 00:29:08,351
Owen. I know.

656
00:29:10,928 --> 00:29:12,684
I know you.

657
00:29:14,581 --> 00:29:16,184
I want that, too.

658
00:29:26,939 --> 00:29:28,574
How's it gonna work,
do you think?

659
00:29:30,661 --> 00:29:32,449
It'll figure
itself out.

660
00:29:32,531 --> 00:29:34,160
We'll figure it out.

661
00:29:35,281 --> 00:29:36,701
Yeah.

662
00:29:43,968 --> 00:29:45,660
Hey.

663
00:29:49,531 --> 00:29:50,926
We're gonna have a baby.

664
00:29:53,201 --> 00:29:54,870
We are.

665
00:30:09,701 --> 00:30:11,256
- We'll figure it out.
- Yeah.

666
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,619
Okay.

667
00:30:13,701 --> 00:30:15,449

It's beating on its own.

Whew!

695
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,996
Thank God.
She told me she would haunt me.

00:41:03,761 --> 00:41:06,567
I just...
I really liked her... Cece.

872
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:07,725
- <i>♪ You are the reason ♪</i>
- I know.

873
00:41:07,787 --> 00:41:10,645
<i>♪ I can dance within the
fire of goodbyes ♪</i>

874
00:41:10,716 --> 00:41:13,254
- You, uh... You took the elevator.
- I did.

875
00:41:13,388 --> 00:41:15,123
So you don't learn
from your mistakes, then?

876
00:41:15,253 --> 00:41:18,074
DeLuca,
when did you get so cocky?

877
00:41:18,191 --> 00:41:20,934
When I realized that you like
this just as much as I do.

878
00:41:21,122 --> 00:41:23,021
I think the problem is we need
to get out of these clothes.

879
00:41:23,083 --> 00:41:24,234
Whoa.

880
00:41:24,466 --> 00:41:26,281
You just skipped
a whole lot of steps.

881
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,418
No, I mean the scrubs,
the job.

882
00:41:28,583 --> 00:41:30,707
We need to go out together,
out of this hospital.

883
00:41:30,770 --> 00:41:32,608
- Tonight.
- <i>There she is.</i>

884
00:41:32,811 --> 00:41:34,074
Dr. Grey.

885
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:36,098
I wanted to see if
you still wanted to...

886
00:41:36,201 --> 00:41:39,449
♪ It's the beauty
in forgotten love ♪

887
00:41:39,534 --> 00:41:41,073
Sorry. could Dr. Grey
and I have a minute?

888
00:41:41,135 --> 00:41:43,495
Actually, we're just right in
the middle of something, so...

889
00:41:43,923 --> 00:41:45,021
♪ It's the beauty
in forgotten love ♪

890
00:41:45,083 --> 00:41:46,238
I'm sorry.

891
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:49,427
I'm being haunted.

892
00:41:49,684 --> 00:41:51,387
♪ Oh, oh, oh, oh ♪

893
00:41:51,473 --> 00:41:54,199
- <i>♪ It's the beauty in forgotten love ♪</i>
- It's been a long day,

894
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:57,317
and I'm going to go home
and see my children.

895
00:41:57,864 --> 00:42:01,572
I will see you later.

896
00:42:02,785 --> 00:42:04,621
- You'll see...
- who later?

897
00:42:04,762 --> 00:42:06,944
<i>We might even find
ourselves happy.</i>

898
