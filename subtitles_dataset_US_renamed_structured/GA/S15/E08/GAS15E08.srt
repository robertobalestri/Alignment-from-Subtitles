Thanks.

6
00:00:28,921 --> 00:00:30,489
Are you okay?

7
00:00:31,827 --> 00:00:34,231
I lost control, Meredith.

8
00:00:35,178 --> 00:00:38,442
I was angry,

9
00:00:38,663 --> 00:00:40,982
and this bar...

10
00:00:41,069 --> 00:00:43,356
it was just awful.

11
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:45,310
They're predators.

12
00:00:45,397 --> 00:00:47,115
They're destroying lives.

14
00:00:49,935 --> 00:00:52,334
Yeah, well, this
wind is picking up.

15
00:00:52,421 --> 00:00:53,732
We better get going.

16
00:00:53,819 --> 00:00:56,223
Catherine says
you haven't gotten a new sponsor

17
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:57,411
since Ollie died,

18
00:00:57,498 --> 00:00:59,317
you're not making meetings,

19
00:00:59,442 --> 00:01:01,950
and now
you're destroying bars.

20
00:01:04,435 --> 00:01:06,559
You need to get
your head right,

21
00:01:06,685 --> 00:01:08,903
get your head in a place
where you can take care

22
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:11,317
of the people
who depend on you.

Okay... Ben?

29
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:32,723
Sorry I woke you,

30
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:33,983
but I, uh,

31
00:01:34,132 --> 00:01:35,270
I didn't know the rules

32
00:01:35,357 --> 00:01:37,740
about using
my key during our separation.

33
00:01:37,827 --> 00:01:39,051
We are not separated.

34
00:01:39,138 --> 00:01:40,637
We are taking time apart

35
00:01:40,724 --> 00:01:42,139
so that I can focus on

36
00:01:42,226 --> 00:01:43,381
bringing my stress down.

37
00:01:43,468 --> 00:01:45,691
- It's a sabbatical.
- Yeah, I know what you call it.

38
00:01:45,778 --> 00:01:48,420
And even though
I'm not sleeping in this house,

39
00:01:48,507 --> 00:01:50,531
I still want the people
who live here to stay safe.

40
00:01:50,618 --> 00:01:51,782
Wind storm's on the way.

41
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:53,555
It's supposed
to get pretty ugly. I, uh...

42
00:01:53,642 --> 00:01:55,302
I was gonna board up the
windows before my shift...

43
00:01:55,389 --> 00:01:56,428
Oh.

44
00:01:56,515 --> 00:01:58,185
If that's okay
with you.

45
00:01:58,294 --> 00:01:59,989
Yes, of course.

46
00:02:00,194 --> 00:02:01,630
Just try not to
wake up Tuck.

47
00:02:01,717 --> 00:02:03,128
I will hammer
the nails into the boards

48
00:02:03,215 --> 00:02:04,762
as quietly as possible.

49
00:02:05,679 --> 00:02:07,716
I'll do
Tuck's windows last.

50
00:02:11,624 --> 00:02:13,060
Oh.

51
00:02:25,416 --> 00:02:26,859
- Hey.
- Hi.

52
00:02:31,813 --> 00:02:32,935
There's a...

53
00:02:33,164 --> 00:02:35,482
There's a tree down
over on Madison.

54
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:37,138
Yeah, I saw.

55
00:02:37,271 --> 00:02:38,998
God, it's crazy out there.

56
00:02:39,234 --> 00:02:40,794
They said it's only gonna
get worse

57
00:02:40,881 --> 00:02:42,024
throughout the day.

58
00:02:42,111 --> 00:02:44,755
So, are we talking
about the <i>weather,</i> Maggie?

59
00:02:44,938 --> 00:02:47,091
That's... our new thing?

60
00:02:49,808 --> 00:02:51,540
- Hey.
- Altman.

61
00:02:52,347 --> 00:02:53,875
Am I gonna like the reason
you're here?

62
00:02:53,962 --> 00:02:55,775
Well, I couldn't
sit in my hotel room today,

63
00:02:55,862 --> 00:02:57,383
and you're gonna be inundated
with patients.

64
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:58,581
Hey.

65
00:02:58,921 --> 00:03:01,845
Hey,
any update on Betty?

66
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:03,318
- No.
- Nothing.

67
00:03:03,651 --> 00:03:05,243
I'm gonna take Leo upstairs.

68
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:07,352
- Yeah. See you, buddy.
- Ohh.

69
00:03:09,932 --> 00:03:11,343
Nobody got much sleep
last night.

70
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:12,432
Yeah.

71
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:13,618
How much longer you
in town?

72
00:03:13,705 --> 00:03:14,705
Um, I'm...

73
00:03:14,792 --> 00:03:15,939
I'm not really sure,

74
00:03:16,026 --> 00:03:17,806
but if you need help with
anything,

75
00:03:17,893 --> 00:03:19,579
- just let me know.
- Okay, thanks.

76
00:03:23,933 --> 00:03:26,172
Their kid's been missing
for three days.

77
00:03:26,267 --> 00:03:28,024
I couldn't dump
any more on them.

78
00:03:28,111 --> 00:03:29,748
That's very thoughtful.

79
00:03:40,316 --> 00:03:41,915
Oh, is, uh, Karev around?

80
00:03:42,002 --> 00:03:43,330
His mess is.

81
00:03:43,417 --> 00:03:45,564
Oh, uh,
this is a matter for the chief.

82
00:03:45,651 --> 00:03:47,431
Um,
I'll come back later.

83
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:50,158
Uh, if you peel that tape,

84
00:03:50,621 --> 00:03:52,339
you'll find my name,

85
00:03:52,426 --> 00:03:55,128
and I'm here, which says
a lot more than Karev,

86
00:03:55,215 --> 00:03:56,565
who seems
to think "interim"

87
00:03:56,652 --> 00:03:59,064
means "sloppy"
and "whenever he feels like it."

88
00:03:59,151 --> 00:04:02,283
So... just say
whatever it is.

89
00:04:04,645 --> 00:04:08,259
Um, well,
I was... close

90
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:10,048
to Frankie Shavelson.

91
00:04:11,754 --> 00:04:12,860
Oh.

92
00:04:12,947 --> 00:04:15,845
Oh, yeah.
I was so sorry to hear...

93
00:04:16,574 --> 00:04:18,033
Are you all right?

94
00:04:18,325 --> 00:04:20,845
Yesterday, I, um,

95
00:04:21,122 --> 00:04:22,728
went into a bar and...

96
00:04:22,815 --> 00:04:25,525
- Richard, no.
- I didn't drink,

97
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,876
and I didn't hurt anyone.

98
00:04:29,012 --> 00:04:31,400
I lost my temper.

99
00:04:32,403 --> 00:04:35,611
There was
property damage,

100
00:04:36,571 --> 00:04:38,611
and I was arrested.

101
00:04:41,342 --> 00:04:44,380
Well, I'll
need to inform the board,

102
00:04:44,467 --> 00:04:46,304
and there will be
an inquiry.

103
00:04:46,391 --> 00:04:49,480
I... do need
to bench you for today.

104
00:04:49,584 --> 00:04:52,464
You'll get some rest,
catch up on charts.

105
00:04:52,771 --> 00:04:54,579
Just stay away
from patients.

106
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:57,035
- Can you manage that?
- I can.

107
00:04:59,266 --> 00:05:00,808
Thank you, Bailey.

108
00:05:05,313 --> 00:05:07,826
Where the hell is
Alex Karev?

109
00:05:19,242 --> 00:05:20,703
Mm.

110
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:23,772
You have pillow marks
on your face.

111
00:05:23,953 --> 00:05:27,522
I haven't slept that hard
since I took that stupid job.

112
00:05:27,899 --> 00:05:32,311
I'm gonna nap for like...
for like five more minutes.

113
00:05:33,546 --> 00:05:36,615
I feel like
I got at least eight hours.

114
00:05:37,665 --> 00:05:39,352
Oh, crap!

115
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,962
Crap!

116
00:05:41,481 --> 00:05:42,626
What?

117
00:05:43,954 --> 00:05:45,694
Okay, breathe in for me,
Cece.

118
00:05:45,781 --> 00:05:46,750
Good.

119
00:05:46,837 --> 00:05:48,273
Oh, Dr. Grey,

120
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,608
I have something
to show you.

121
00:05:50,704 --> 00:05:52,234
I normally don't take pictures,

122
00:05:52,321 --> 00:05:53,436
but I couldn't help it.

123
00:05:53,523 --> 00:05:55,662
I snapped this one
while he wasn't looking.

124
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,022
Cece, save your strength.

125
00:05:58,109 --> 00:06:00,959
He has distinctly
kind eyes

126
00:06:01,196 --> 00:06:03,537
and a playful
sense of humor,

127
00:06:03,727 --> 00:06:06,287
and he's a surgeon
in this hospital.

128
00:06:06,374 --> 00:06:07,922
Dr. Lincoln.

129
00:06:08,009 --> 00:06:09,053
Yeah,
I know who he is.

130
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:10,126
And?

131
00:06:10,221 --> 00:06:12,136
And, DeLuca,
I'm waiting.

132
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:14,453
Yes, uh, her respiration's
getting more labored,

133
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,068
she's complaining
of more shortness of breath.

134
00:06:16,155 --> 00:06:17,912
It's probably
the pleural effusions.

135
00:06:17,999 --> 00:06:20,945
Meredith,
I just showed you perfection.

136
00:06:21,032 --> 00:06:22,490
And I don't have
the time.

137
00:06:22,577 --> 00:06:24,030
Have you looked at me?

138
00:06:24,345 --> 00:06:25,951
<i>I'm</i> the one
who doesn't have time.

139
00:06:26,038 --> 00:06:27,780
Okay, so then
I'll make it quick.

140
00:06:27,867 --> 00:06:30,280
Let's prep her for
a pleurocentesis.

141
00:06:30,821 --> 00:06:32,926
Uh, hey, is, uh...

142
00:06:33,337 --> 00:06:34,379
is everything okay?

143
00:06:34,466 --> 00:06:36,506
Just check back
in an hour.

144
00:06:43,409 --> 00:06:44,983
Hey,
did you check the weather?

145
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:46,707
Do I ever check
the weather?

146
00:06:47,001 --> 00:06:48,698
Uh, it's windy.
That's helpful.

147
00:06:48,805 --> 00:06:50,149
Okay.

148
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,025
Oh, uh.

149
00:06:53,112 --> 00:06:55,318
Well, t-they're telling everyone
to stay off the roads,

150
00:06:55,405 --> 00:06:57,062
that there's
three accidents on the I-5.

151
00:06:57,149 --> 00:06:58,843
The bridge is closed.
I mean, we're screwed.

152
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:00,818
Yeah, well, if it's that bad,
then the hospital's slammed.

153
00:07:00,905 --> 00:07:02,264
We need to go.

154
00:07:10,925 --> 00:07:12,672
We can't help
if we're dead.

155
00:07:15,396 --> 00:07:17,949
No, no, no, Karev.
Stay there until it's safe.

156
00:07:18,036 --> 00:07:20,010
We'll figure something out.
We always do.

157
00:07:20,097 --> 00:07:22,543
Okay, we got burns,
car-wreck injuries,

158
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:24,255
and flying debris has given us

159
00:07:24,342 --> 00:07:25,848
a ton of blunt injuries

160
00:07:25,935 --> 00:07:27,620
and several
penetrating traumas.

161
00:07:27,771 --> 00:07:29,580
Wind storms are
my favorite.

162
00:07:29,667 --> 00:07:31,963
Yeah, you're gonna love this.

163
00:07:48,035 --> 00:07:49,618
We're supposed to <i>love</i> this?

164
00:07:49,705 --> 00:07:50,993
Oh, ho, ho.

165
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,439
Impalement-palooza.

166
00:07:53,526 --> 00:07:55,510
Bailey,
I don't think we have room

167
00:07:55,597 --> 00:07:56,642
to treat all these patients,

168
00:07:56,729 --> 00:07:59,142
and Seattle Pres is already
closed to trauma.

169
00:08:05,988 --> 00:08:07,508
Hey!

170
00:08:07,729 --> 00:08:09,210
Uh, hello!

171
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:11,854
Everyone...
Hey, be quiet!

172
00:08:14,359 --> 00:08:15,371
Listen up.

173
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:17,947
We will move
all stable patients upstairs

174
00:08:18,034 --> 00:08:19,004
to clear beds.

175
00:08:19,091 --> 00:08:20,924
We will stock
disaster supplies

176
00:08:21,011 --> 00:08:22,316
on all floors.

177
00:08:22,403 --> 00:08:24,158
And we will notify
the blood bank

178
00:08:24,245 --> 00:08:26,346
to have extra units
on standby.

179
00:08:26,433 --> 00:08:29,113
We are staying open
for trauma,

180
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,846
but sheltering
in place.

181
00:08:30,933 --> 00:08:33,222
This is a brick house,

182
00:08:33,309 --> 00:08:37,385
and no amount of huffing and puffing
can blow us down.

183
00:08:37,472 --> 00:08:39,291
Whoo! Whoo!

184
00:08:43,551 --> 00:08:45,806
- Yeah, I still got it.
- Okay, come on. Let's go.

185
00:08:45,893 --> 00:08:47,931
- You need something.
- Come to the OR.

186
00:08:51,099 --> 00:08:52,762
Did you eat
the rest of the chips?

187
00:08:52,849 --> 00:08:54,244
Apparently only
a third of the staff

188
00:08:54,331 --> 00:08:55,541
- can make it into work.
- Oh,

189
00:08:55,628 --> 00:08:57,980
the... the barbecue ones,
the blue bag?

190
00:08:58,067 --> 00:09:00,035
They're sending floor nurses
down to the E.R.

191
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:02,136
Apparently anesthesia's

192
00:09:02,223 --> 00:09:04,436
- working... triple.
- Ugh! Where are the chips?

193
00:09:04,523 --> 00:09:06,284
- I ate them last night.
- Oh.

194
00:09:06,895 --> 00:09:08,308
I feel like a crappy leader.

195
00:09:08,395 --> 00:09:09,776
I mean, who the hell
abandons the ship

196
00:09:09,863 --> 00:09:11,440
in the middle of a disaster?

197
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:14,855
Maybe
it's not a disaster.

198
00:09:14,942 --> 00:09:16,592
We've hardly seen each other
since we got married,

199
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:17,979
and we're stuck here,

200
00:09:18,066 --> 00:09:21,846
so... what if we make this
our second honeymoon?

201
00:09:23,088 --> 00:09:24,158
With no food?

202
00:09:24,245 --> 00:09:28,962
We have jelly
and bread and beer and...

203
00:09:30,277 --> 00:09:32,174
Expired mac-and-cheese.

204
00:09:35,536 --> 00:09:36,575
It's fine,

205
00:09:36,671 --> 00:09:38,236
because
we have a gas stove.

206
00:09:40,902 --> 00:09:42,153
Oh.

207
00:09:43,069 --> 00:09:44,642
When's the last time
we cooked?

208
00:09:49,653 --> 00:09:50,940
Right there.
Trauma one.

209
00:09:51,027 --> 00:09:51,949
- Okay.
- Go, go.

210
00:09:52,036 --> 00:09:53,416
No more trauma rooms.
Next incoming

211
00:09:53,503 --> 00:09:54,567
can go to procedure room 4.

212
00:09:54,654 --> 00:09:55,791
Avery needs me in 1.
Could you...

213
00:09:55,878 --> 00:09:56,896
Go, go.

214
00:09:57,002 --> 00:09:58,245
Schmitt,
I told you trauma 2.

215
00:09:58,332 --> 00:10:01,737
Trauma 2's the...
the selfie stick in the brain, and...

216
00:10:01,824 --> 00:10:03,142
Helm, you got a problem
with brains?

217
00:10:03,229 --> 00:10:04,244
- Love brains.
- Trauma 2.

218
00:10:04,331 --> 00:10:06,371
Schmitt, go to the clinic
with Dr. Kim.

219
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:08,423
We need to clear the patients
per the protocol.

220
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:09,590
On it.

221
00:10:10,115 --> 00:10:13,011
I'm not afraid anymore.
Of the s-selfie stick.

222
00:10:13,098 --> 00:10:14,033
- I can do it.
- Too late.

223
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,252
Think about that
on your way to the clinic.

224
00:10:16,522 --> 00:10:17,863
- Bailey.
- Altman.

225
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,745
Uh, cardio consult
in trauma 1.

226
00:10:19,832 --> 00:10:22,026
Oh, I was just about
to ask you for privileges,

227
00:10:22,113 --> 00:10:23,517
- but now I don't need to.
- Go.

228
00:10:24,192 --> 00:10:25,650
You live here now?

229
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:28,183
<i>Dr. Ford, 3235.</i>

230
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:30,595
- <i>Dr. Ford, 3235.</i>
- Why did I get a glass door?

231
00:10:30,682 --> 00:10:32,377
Hold tight, Georgia.
We got you.

232
00:10:32,691 --> 00:10:34,111
Qadri, hand me a 4x4.

233
00:10:34,198 --> 00:10:36,627
Dr. Grey.
How was sunny L.A.?

234
00:10:36,714 --> 00:10:38,189
Not so sunny.

235
00:10:38,377 --> 00:10:39,916
Do you think
it violated the fascia?

236
00:10:40,003 --> 00:10:41,027
Uh, not sure.

237
00:10:41,114 --> 00:10:43,819
I am worried about
a thoracoabdominal injury.

238
00:10:43,906 --> 00:10:46,010
I thought you weren't coming
back until tomorrow night.

239
00:10:46,321 --> 00:10:47,650
Plans changed.

240
00:10:48,074 --> 00:10:49,222
Well, if you're home,

241
00:10:49,309 --> 00:10:50,611
maybe I won't drink
a whole bottle of wine

242
00:10:50,698 --> 00:10:52,339
and eat a whole carton
of ice cream by myself.

243
00:10:52,426 --> 00:10:54,853
There's fluid
in the upper-right quadrant.

244
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:56,306
Missed the liver.

245
00:10:56,567 --> 00:10:58,189
Can you make a fist
for me?

246
00:10:58,276 --> 00:11:00,173
Now open.
That's great.

247
00:11:00,402 --> 00:11:01,548
There's no major damage.

248
00:11:01,635 --> 00:11:03,619
Qadri, clean and stitch.

249
00:11:04,808 --> 00:11:06,439
Good to have you back,
Grey.

250
00:11:06,987 --> 00:11:08,447
So, you said
your plans changed.

251
00:11:08,534 --> 00:11:09,820
Did your VIP patient die?

252
00:11:09,907 --> 00:11:13,050
No, the... just the plans,
they just changed.

253
00:11:13,137 --> 00:11:15,548
Qadri, let's get her up to CT,
please.

254
00:11:18,404 --> 00:11:19,864
I can see it

255
00:11:19,951 --> 00:11:21,176
out of the corner of my eye,

256
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:22,705
but I can't feel it.

257
00:11:22,868 --> 00:11:24,980
You can't feel it
because your brain

258
00:11:25,067 --> 00:11:26,409
doesn't have
any pain receptors.

259
00:11:26,496 --> 00:11:27,830
I know you're scared,
but I need you

260
00:11:27,917 --> 00:11:29,523
to stop moving around
so much, okay?

261
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:32,722
I have a selfie stick
in my head.

262
00:11:32,809 --> 00:11:35,651
It's not even mine.
It's some idiot teenager's.

263
00:11:35,738 --> 00:11:37,017
How is
she talking this much?

264
00:11:37,104 --> 00:11:38,713
Adrenaline, maybe?
I don't know.

265
00:11:38,826 --> 00:11:40,042
How we doing?

266
00:11:40,129 --> 00:11:42,554
I told CT you'd be on your way
any minute.

267
00:11:42,641 --> 00:11:44,267
Wh-When are you
taking it out?

268
00:11:44,354 --> 00:11:46,040
You can take it out,
right?

269
00:11:46,127 --> 00:11:47,409
Please take it out.

270
00:11:47,496 --> 00:11:50,072
Phoebe, I am gonna do
everything I can to remove it,

271
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:52,542
but when I do,
there is a strong possibility

272
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:54,486
that your brain will bleed
or swell.

273
00:11:54,573 --> 00:11:55,931
I just want to prepare you

274
00:11:56,018 --> 00:11:58,798
in case you want to call
anyone before surgery.

275
00:11:59,931 --> 00:12:01,589
My mom.

276
00:12:01,707 --> 00:12:03,108
Can I call my mom?

277
00:12:03,195 --> 00:12:05,392
The paramedics said
they had my phone.

278
00:12:05,479 --> 00:12:06,838
We'll find it.

279
00:12:10,544 --> 00:12:12,728
Bailey,
I need to... I just...

280
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:14,900
- Oh, go, go.
- Yeah.

281
00:12:16,582 --> 00:12:18,580
Do you see yourself?

282
00:12:18,692 --> 00:12:21,969
I told you
not to go outside in that mess!

283
00:12:22,056 --> 00:12:24,275
Do you see me?
How about some sympathy?

284
00:12:24,362 --> 00:12:25,534
And stop shouting!

285
00:12:25,621 --> 00:12:27,743
Nobody can hear themselves think
with you in here.

286
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,580
Can someone please
check my ears

287
00:12:29,667 --> 00:12:30,965
for years of damage?

288
00:12:31,052 --> 00:12:32,390
So, you two are married, then.

289
00:12:32,477 --> 00:12:34,072
Decreased breath sounds
on the right.

290
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:35,533
He's got a small pneumo.

291
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:37,933
- We were having a fight.
- Which <i>he</i> started.

292
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,922
So I went outside
to get away from her.

293
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:42,147
Which is all
he ever does.

294
00:12:42,234 --> 00:12:45,150
And I slammed the front door
on her perfectly.

295
00:12:45,237 --> 00:12:47,930
Rivaled the Great Door
Slam of 1987.

296
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:51,965
And then someone's
mailbox slammed

297
00:12:52,052 --> 00:12:53,425
into our sycamore.

298
00:12:53,512 --> 00:12:55,137
But I couldn't undo that door slam,

299
00:12:55,224 --> 00:12:57,636
so I took a walk.

300
00:12:57,723 --> 00:12:58,963
Like an idiot.

301
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:00,976
I can't tell if there's
a pericardial effusion.

302
00:13:01,063 --> 00:13:02,400
I'm getting a pulse in the neck,

303
00:13:02,487 --> 00:13:03,979
but I'm worried about
an underlying injury.

304
00:13:04,066 --> 00:13:06,982
So, I'm standing in front
of the Hoffmans' house

305
00:13:07,069 --> 00:13:08,860
when their stupid Christmas

306
00:13:08,947 --> 00:13:11,074
decorations caught the wind,

307
00:13:11,161 --> 00:13:12,681
and, ta-da!

308
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:15,180
I should be in Santa's workshop.

309
00:13:15,267 --> 00:13:16,859
It isn't even Thanksgiving.

310
00:13:16,946 --> 00:13:18,206
It's enraging.

311
00:13:18,293 --> 00:13:20,760
I wrote a letter to
the neighborhood association.

312
00:13:20,847 --> 00:13:22,037
I write one every year.

313
00:13:22,124 --> 00:13:24,056
- Hah!
- Hm?

314
00:13:24,574 --> 00:13:25,918
Oh, thank God.

315
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:27,164
Owen.

316
00:13:30,047 --> 00:13:32,057
- You two got this?
- Yeah.

317
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:37,081
What happened?

318
00:13:37,168 --> 00:13:38,937
I'm okay.
It barely stings.

319
00:13:39,024 --> 00:13:41,138
She walked here from Yesler
and got hit by a tree branch.

320
00:13:41,225 --> 00:13:42,880
So she says,
follow my finger.

321
00:13:43,036 --> 00:13:44,153
She needs a few stitches.

322
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,054
And a CT scan
and a tox screen.

323
00:13:46,141 --> 00:13:47,280
I don't need that.

324
00:13:47,367 --> 00:13:49,193
It's just gonna say I'm high.

325
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:51,766
I'm sorry.

326
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:54,201
I know I messed up,
but I want to get clean.

327
00:13:54,288 --> 00:13:57,045
I came back because of you
and Owen and Leo.

328
00:13:59,534 --> 00:14:02,094
I have to go.
I have a surgery. Um...

329
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:04,165
Just tell the nurses
she's an addict

330
00:14:04,252 --> 00:14:05,790
and don't give her
anything.

331
00:14:08,183 --> 00:14:09,281
I'm so sorry.

332
00:14:09,368 --> 00:14:10,378
Hey,

333
00:14:10,643 --> 00:14:12,774
it's gonna be okay,
okay?

334
00:14:21,713 --> 00:14:24,634
Come on,
come on. Where are you?

335
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:26,064
What's all that stuff?

336
00:14:26,151 --> 00:14:27,548
Just wedding gifts.

337
00:14:27,635 --> 00:14:29,181
I can't find Bubby!

338
00:14:29,699 --> 00:14:32,899
Is Bubby a security blanket
or a pet rat?

339
00:14:32,986 --> 00:14:34,642
There you are!

340
00:14:35,871 --> 00:14:38,064
This is Bubby.

341
00:14:38,761 --> 00:14:41,954
She gave me hot meals
when I was living in my car.

342
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:44,276
I didn't have grandparents.

343
00:14:44,363 --> 00:14:46,626
I can't believe the real answer
is sadder than a pet rat.

344
00:14:46,713 --> 00:14:47,953
Trust me
when I say your

345
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,219
mac-and-cheese will
be made with love.

346
00:14:53,779 --> 00:14:55,534
- Oh, no.
- What?

347
00:14:55,724 --> 00:14:56,932
What is it?

348
00:14:58,497 --> 00:15:00,824
- Our marriage license.
- So?

349
00:15:00,911 --> 00:15:03,026
So if you don't mail it in,
it's not official!

350
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:04,385
Was that my job?

351
00:15:04,472 --> 00:15:05,505
Kinda!

352
00:15:05,657 --> 00:15:07,128
So we're not married?

353
00:15:08,747 --> 00:15:10,065
Hello? Yeah.

354
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:12,043
What's up, Schmitt?

355
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:14,299
Uh, Dr. Karev,
Josh Gordon's in the clinic

356
00:15:14,386 --> 00:15:17,306
with abdominal pain
and vomiting and...

357
00:15:18,129 --> 00:15:19,628
Got it. Will do.

358
00:15:21,522 --> 00:15:24,426
Dr. Karev said to put in an NG
tube and admit him to peds.

359
00:15:24,513 --> 00:15:25,793
I'll take Mrs. Aguilar over,

360
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,182
then I'll be back
to handle Josh.

361
00:15:27,269 --> 00:15:28,527
- I've got Josh.
- No, no, no.

362
00:15:28,614 --> 00:15:30,276
His electrolytes are
all over the place,

363
00:15:30,363 --> 00:15:31,590
probably an SBO,

364
00:15:31,677 --> 00:15:33,166
and I have experience
with adminis...

365
00:15:33,253 --> 00:15:35,862
Yeah, I know.
You've got all the experience.

366
00:15:36,013 --> 00:15:39,435
You've had a lot more
patients than I've had.

367
00:15:39,513 --> 00:15:40,738
But I've had patients, too,

368
00:15:40,816 --> 00:15:43,127
many with small bowel
obstructions and NG tubes,

369
00:15:43,214 --> 00:15:44,667
so I've got it.

370
00:15:45,147 --> 00:15:46,385
But if you want to help,

371
00:15:46,472 --> 00:15:48,838
you can walk him
to peds when I'm done.

372
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,890
Mommy,
I don't want you to be worried.

373
00:15:54,977 --> 00:15:56,209
I'm okay.

374
00:15:56,815 --> 00:15:58,712
It happened
on my way to work.

375
00:15:59,347 --> 00:16:01,321
No, work's good.

376
00:16:01,815 --> 00:16:04,250
Helm, we'll keep her
in a sitting position.

377
00:16:06,222 --> 00:16:09,557
C-Could you go by my house
later after the storm

378
00:16:09,644 --> 00:16:11,384
and take over for the dog sitter?

379
00:16:12,409 --> 00:16:14,852
I might be a little longer
than I thought.

380
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:18,915
And don't forget, he only gets
one treat after dinner.

381
00:16:21,635 --> 00:16:23,305
Thanks, Mom.

382
00:16:24,472 --> 00:16:26,118
You're the best.

383
00:16:27,174 --> 00:16:29,688
You're the very best mom.

384
00:16:31,534 --> 00:16:33,173
I'll call you after?

385
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:36,305
Be safe.
Love you.

386
00:16:38,847 --> 00:16:41,954
Sorry, I just...
I don't like to scare her.

387
00:16:42,271 --> 00:16:43,915
We understand.

388
00:16:44,998 --> 00:16:46,269
Ready?

389
00:16:54,501 --> 00:16:56,210
She's plenty scared.

390
00:17:02,658 --> 00:17:03,852
- Hey.
- Hey.

391
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:05,258
Welcome to the North Pole.

392
00:17:05,345 --> 00:17:07,492
Huh. You should've seen
his wife screaming at him

393
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:08,592
all the way
up to the red line.

394
00:17:08,679 --> 00:17:09,862
Marital bliss.

395
00:17:10,028 --> 00:17:11,059
You take him to CT?

396
00:17:11,146 --> 00:17:13,450
No, there were a dozen patients
up ahead of us in line.

397
00:17:13,537 --> 00:17:15,354
I'm thinking
we cut the top off

398
00:17:15,441 --> 00:17:16,768
and just pull the cane
out from the bottom.

399
00:17:16,855 --> 00:17:18,171
Works for me.

400
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,935
How's Betty?

401
00:17:21,102 --> 00:17:22,329
Oh, um,

402
00:17:22,463 --> 00:17:24,385
she seems
to be mostly okay.

403
00:17:24,472 --> 00:17:26,158
- Thank you, by the way.
- Yeah.

404
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:27,744
Staying means a lot.

405
00:17:30,643 --> 00:17:32,425
Owen, I...

406
00:17:33,122 --> 00:17:34,652
I need to tell you
something.

407
00:17:34,808 --> 00:17:37,493
- What?
- Not here... later.

408
00:17:37,933 --> 00:17:40,430
Can we grab a cup of coffee
after surgery?

409
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:41,931
Uh, sure.

410
00:17:42,018 --> 00:17:44,039
We... We...
We need to get in there.

411
00:17:44,126 --> 00:17:45,266
Okay.

412
00:17:52,944 --> 00:17:54,605
- Basin.
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

413
00:17:54,692 --> 00:17:56,402
Cottonoid.
And fibrin glue?

414
00:17:56,489 --> 00:17:58,777
Yeah, just a little.
Good.

415
00:18:01,452 --> 00:18:03,810
- Agh, damn it. Suction.
- What happened?

416
00:18:03,897 --> 00:18:06,098
Stick must have been tamponading
her vertebral artery.

417
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:07,527
Helm, suction.

418
00:18:11,217 --> 00:18:12,215
He said
I don't talk

419
00:18:12,302 --> 00:18:13,706
about my feelings
enough,

420
00:18:13,881 --> 00:18:15,379
that I don't
share enough.

421
00:18:15,564 --> 00:18:17,715
He should do
more surgeries with you.

422
00:18:18,118 --> 00:18:19,171
What?

423
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,443
Okay, it doesn't look like
it damaged the fascia.

424
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:23,035
Qadri, do you want
to do the honors?

425
00:18:23,122 --> 00:18:24,629
- Pull it out?
- Yes.

426
00:18:25,787 --> 00:18:28,074
Straight up.
Straight.

427
00:18:28,811 --> 00:18:30,163
Good.

428
00:18:31,878 --> 00:18:32,956

let's wash it out
and start the repair.

433
00:18:39,353 --> 00:18:40,749
Irrigation.

00:18:41,823 --> 00:18:43,327
Do you think
I'm overreacting?

435
00:18:43,414 --> 00:18:45,571
This woman had 50 pieces
of glass in her.

436
00:18:45,658 --> 00:18:47,135

killed her.

437

Pulse is dropping, and her
pressure's through the roof.

452
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:39,794
Because she's herniating.

453
00:19:39,881 --> 00:19:42,176
Should we give her mannitol
or start hypertonic saline?

454
00:19:42,263 --> 00:19:43,833
- It won't work.
- What? Why?

455
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,488
Her brain stem is
going dark.

456
00:19:45,725 --> 00:19:47,472

But she was talking.

461
00:19:57,290 --> 00:20:00,733
She... She talked to us.
She... She talked to her mom.

462
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:01,758
She was lucid.

463
00:20:01,845 --> 00:20:03,639
The stick was right up
against her artery.

464
00:20:03,743 --> 00:20:05,381
Any attempt
to remove it was a risk

465
00:20:05,468 --> 00:20:08,514
for hemorrhage
and uncontrollable swelling.

466
00:20:09,344 --> 00:20:10,585
She never had a chance.

467
00:20:10,672 --> 00:20:11,981
No.

468
00:20:13,449 --> 00:20:15,141
Can you check
to see if she's a donor?

469
00:20:15,228 --> 00:20:16,874
She is... B negative.

470
00:20:17,009 --> 00:20:19,639
All right, let's, uh,
close her up,

471
00:20:19,821 --> 00:20:21,764
get her up to ICU
until we can call it.

472
00:20:21,851 --> 00:20:23,272
Helm, let's go.

473
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:24,621
B negative?

474
00:20:25,095 --> 00:20:26,172
Yes, why?

475
00:20:26,259 --> 00:20:28,030
That matches
Cece Colvin.

477
00:20:39,552 --> 00:20:41,462

There's no more patients.

00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:43,150
Just making sure
you get back okay.

479
00:20:43,237 --> 00:20:44,018
Ready?

480
00:20:44,105 --> 00:20:45,719
Don't worry about me.

481
00:20:45,886 --> 00:20:47,282
I'm waiting it out over here,

482
00:20:47,369 --> 00:20:49,362
and not because
I'm scared or weak

483
00:20:49,449 --> 00:20:51,095
but because it's
the sensible thing to do.

484
00:20:51,182 --> 00:20:52,485
The winds are picking up.

485
00:20:52,572 --> 00:20:54,366
Listen, I'm sorry

486
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:55,693
if I came off harsh in the elevator.

487
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:57,378
You were an ass.

488
00:20:59,123 --> 00:21:01,667
This... This is exactly
what I didn't want.

489
00:21:01,755 --> 00:21:04,190
I don't need the drama,
the... the hurt feelings,

490
00:21:04,277 --> 00:21:05,651
the freshly coming out.

491
00:21:05,738 --> 00:21:07,737
I don't need
the shame spiral.

492
00:21:09,115 --> 00:21:10,871
Look, you're really sweet,

493
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:13,246
but... I can't guide you
out of the closet

494
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:15,159
like some kind of gay Sherpa,
all right?

495
00:21:15,246 --> 00:21:17,761
I'm not the drama.
You're the drama.

496
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:20,340
And you're also clueless
if you think it's safe

497
00:21:20,427 --> 00:21:22,184
to cross the ambulance bay
right now.

498
00:21:22,271 --> 00:21:23,628
Ever heard
of the Venturi effect,

499
00:21:23,715 --> 00:21:25,495
Mr. "I'm So Experienced"?

500
00:21:25,607 --> 00:21:26,731
It means wind speeds

501
00:21:26,818 --> 00:21:28,737
can easily double
in between two buildings,

502
00:21:28,824 --> 00:21:29,965
creating a tunnel.

503
00:21:30,052 --> 00:21:31,409
There's a reason they call

504
00:21:31,496 --> 00:21:33,611
Pacific Northwest windstorms
"Big Blows."

512
00:22:33,439 --> 00:22:34,562

513
00:22:34,713 --> 00:22:36,880
Yeah, I think so.

514
00:22:40,891 --> 00:22:42,421
Ohh! That was...

00:22:44,012 --> 00:22:45,937

517
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:54,410

518
00:22:54,566 --> 00:22:56,066
All right, keep going.

519
00:22:56,153 --> 00:22:58,855
There's no injury
to the jugular so far.

520
00:22:58,943 --> 00:23:00,308

521

Listen,
slow and steady.

522
00:23:02,211 --> 00:23:03,286
I don't want him
to bleed out.

523
00:23:03,373 --> 00:23:05,097
We're buying him some time
away from his wife.

524
00:23:05,184 --> 00:23:06,878
We might be doing him
a favor.

525
00:23:10,056 --> 00:23:12,108
So, did something happen,
something bad?

526
00:23:12,195 --> 00:23:13,185
Not now.

527
00:23:13,272 --> 00:23:15,436
Carotid's intact.

528
00:23:17,056 --> 00:23:19,288

something, you should just...

00:23:19,375 --> 00:23:20,461
Owen.

530
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:22,962

00:23:25,071 --> 00:23:26,998
why you came back to Seattle
in the first place?

533
00:23:27,085 --> 00:23:28,778
Why didn't you
talk to me before now?

534
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:32,342
Well, 'cause I didn't want
anyone to... bleed out.

535
00:23:32,504 --> 00:23:34,227
Oh, so it's definitely bad.

536
00:23:34,314 --> 00:23:36,046
Can we just focus
on the surgery?

537
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:38,952
Great. My field's clear.

538
00:23:52,111 --> 00:23:53,736

Ah, uh!

00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:26,617
Did Jackson tell you
what happened?

572
00:25:26,704 --> 00:25:28,312
Because even if he did,
that shouldn't matter.

573

He didn't.

591
00:26:15,148 --> 00:26:17,458
We may have organs
for Cece.

592
00:26:25,171 --> 00:26:26,359
Okay.

593
00:26:27,633 --> 00:26:28,992
Okay.

594
00:26:34,722 --> 00:26:36,991
Grazed the liver,
missed the colon.

595
00:26:37,078 --> 00:26:39,437
I don't see
any damage to the spleen.

596
00:26:39,524 --> 00:26:40,614
How's the heart?

597
00:26:40,701 --> 00:26:43,911
Well, the cane passed anterior
to the pericardium.

598
00:26:44,005 --> 00:26:47,166
There's only a small hole
in the diaphragm,

599
00:26:47,253 --> 00:26:49,322
and it missed
the heart completely.

600
00:26:49,409 --> 00:26:53,202
Yeah, and the bowel only has
a few serosal tears.

601
00:26:53,289 --> 00:26:55,661
- Irrigation?
- Yeah, I can't believe it.

602
00:26:55,748 --> 00:26:57,553

called out.

629
00:28:04,236 --> 00:28:05,376
Wow.

630
00:28:05,463 --> 00:28:06,602
Where are
all the orderlies?

631
00:28:06,689 --> 00:28:09,164
They're stretched thin,
so maintenance is helping out.

632
00:28:09,251 --> 00:28:10,962
This entire hospital
is stretched thin.

633
00:28:11,049 --> 00:28:12,687
You should shut it down
before someone gets hurt.

634
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:14,665
- What? You want her to close trauma?
- Yeah, I do.

635
00:28:14,752 --> 00:28:16,461
Every hospital in the area
is shut down, and...

636
00:28:16,548 --> 00:28:17,615
And this is
a brick house.

637
00:28:17,702 --> 00:28:19,695
- Get him to CT.
- Got it.

638
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:23,297
You know,
for what it's worth,

639
00:28:23,429 --> 00:28:25,337
I was the last one
to find out about Harriet,

640
00:28:25,424 --> 00:28:27,078
and she's the best thing
that ever happened to me.

641
00:28:27,165 --> 00:28:28,905
Could you...
Uh, do you mind talking to...?

642
00:28:28,992 --> 00:28:31,203
Go ahead. Go.
I'll talk to his wife.

643
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:38,237
So I can get
my transplants today?

644
00:28:38,324 --> 00:28:41,422
Yeah, there's a few more tests
that Dr. Pierce has to run,

645
00:28:41,509 --> 00:28:43,170
but if they check out,
yes.

646
00:28:43,271 --> 00:28:45,650
Who's the donor?
Do they have family?

647
00:28:45,737 --> 00:28:47,947
All I can say is that
it was someone

648
00:28:48,034 --> 00:28:49,172
who was hurt
in the storm.

649
00:28:49,259 --> 00:28:50,547
And the storm's
gotten so bad

650
00:28:50,634 --> 00:28:52,367
that UNOS can't
physically send the organs

651
00:28:52,454 --> 00:28:53,326
anywhere else.

652
00:28:53,413 --> 00:28:55,266
So they're
giving them to me?

653
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,289
Why the face?

654
00:28:59,017 --> 00:29:01,195
You weren't the next person
on the list, Cece.

655
00:29:01,282 --> 00:29:02,996
You were nowhere near
the top

656
00:29:03,083 --> 00:29:05,602
because your body's been
through so much damage,

657
00:29:05,708 --> 00:29:07,535
and with procedures
like these,

658
00:29:07,622 --> 00:29:09,856
you're at risk
for catastrophic bleeding.

659
00:29:09,943 --> 00:29:11,467
You'll be under anesthesia
for hours,

660
00:29:11,554 --> 00:29:13,164
which can only increase
the possibility

661
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:15,384
that you'll clot
or have a stroke.

662
00:29:15,471 --> 00:29:17,086
There's a chance
it won't work.

663
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:19,993
There's a chance you might not
make it off Dr. Grey's table.

664
00:29:20,784 --> 00:29:22,969
What's wrong with this one,
again?

665
00:29:23,081 --> 00:29:24,313
He's right.

666
00:29:24,678 --> 00:29:26,711
You don't have
to accept the organs.

667
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:28,344
We are taking
a huge risk.

668
00:29:28,431 --> 00:29:30,676
If I die today,
I die fighting.

669
00:29:30,934 --> 00:29:34,406
I'll die knowing
I did everything I could,

670
00:29:34,682 --> 00:29:36,344
but, Dr. Grey,
if you don't fight,

671
00:29:36,431 --> 00:29:39,599
if you don't try,
if you don't do your part

672
00:29:39,686 --> 00:29:44,658
and squeeze all the light
and love and joy you can

673
00:29:44,745 --> 00:29:47,914
out of this one life
you've been given,

674
00:29:48,458 --> 00:29:50,805
I'm gonna haunt you
from my grave.

675
00:29:51,104 --> 00:29:52,143
Okay.

676
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:53,565
Okay.

677
00:29:54,487 --> 00:29:56,180
Now give me
those organs.

678
00:29:56,304 --> 00:29:59,703
Because I'd much rather
haunt you from above ground.

679
00:30:01,548 --> 00:30:03,906
I will see you upstairs,
Cece.

680
00:30:09,979 --> 00:30:12,031
Okay, so, let's recheck
her potassium

681
00:30:12,118 --> 00:30:14,578
and correct her coagulopathy,
okay?

682
00:30:18,014 --> 00:30:20,853
- Yes.
- Uh, yes to...?

683
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:23,374
Drinks. I'm assuming
the offer's still standing?

684
00:30:23,461 --> 00:30:24,914
- Really?
- Yeah.

685
00:30:25,001 --> 00:30:26,368
Definitely.
Um,

686
00:30:26,455 --> 00:30:27,806
- you want to try tonight?
- Sure.

687
00:30:27,893 --> 00:30:29,085
I mean, if the bar's
still standing

688
00:30:29,172 --> 00:30:30,874
- after the storm.
- Let's do it.

689
00:30:41,389 --> 00:30:43,611
Someone who knows us
thought we'd want this?

690
00:30:43,698 --> 00:30:45,332
Kepner registered
for us.

691
00:30:45,419 --> 00:30:48,527
Wait, what is the point
of the tiny bowls?

692
00:30:48,639 --> 00:30:50,215
Oh, those are
ramekins.

693
00:30:50,525 --> 00:30:53,668
They're, like, uh, good
for crème brûlée and stuff.

694
00:30:54,178 --> 00:30:55,546
Mm, who are you?

695
00:30:55,633 --> 00:30:57,816
Izzie... Izzie,
she baked a lot.

696
00:30:58,226 --> 00:30:59,762
You know
what I'm thinking?

697
00:30:59,928 --> 00:31:01,195
We shouldn't
talk about our exes

698
00:31:01,282 --> 00:31:02,196
on our honeymoon?

699
00:31:02,283 --> 00:31:04,403
No. Mm, we return
all this crap,

700
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:05,520
make a fortune,

701
00:31:05,607 --> 00:31:07,073
buy a bigger TV.

702
00:31:09,804 --> 00:31:11,160

00:31:25,156 --> 00:31:26,424
For your face.

705
00:31:26,961 --> 00:31:28,747
There's some swelling.

706
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:31,507
What?

707
00:31:31,757 --> 00:31:32,809
What happened
to your glasses?

708
00:31:32,896 --> 00:31:35,114
The band snapped when we were
climbing in the rig.

709
00:31:35,273 --> 00:31:36,360
Can you see?

710
00:31:36,447 --> 00:31:37,958
Yes, I can see.

711
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:40,685
Just not perfectly.

712
00:31:41,516 --> 00:31:44,404
They're probably
broken on the ground

713
00:31:44,491 --> 00:31:46,245
or blew away into a tree,

714
00:31:46,332 --> 00:31:48,060
which is
all your fault.

715
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:50,140
You done?

716
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,804
Yes.

717
00:31:53,882 --> 00:31:56,263
No.
No, I'm not done.

718
00:31:56,429 --> 00:31:58,007
You know
what's also your fault?

719
00:31:58,094 --> 00:32:00,035
The fact that you think
I have a shame spiral,

720
00:32:00,122 --> 00:32:01,350
because I don't.

721
00:32:01,437 --> 00:32:03,678
I'm not spiraling.
I'm a nerd.

722
00:32:03,765 --> 00:32:05,907
I'm no more ashamed
of being attracted to guys

723
00:32:05,994 --> 00:32:08,731
than I am of anything else
in my life.

724
00:32:10,449 --> 00:32:12,905
Do you know what I did
almost every night

725
00:32:12,992 --> 00:32:14,653
before I went
to college?

726
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:18,925
I sat
in my mom's basement

727
00:32:19,012 --> 00:32:21,763
with three other
debate-club kids

728
00:32:21,937 --> 00:32:23,661
playing
"Dungeons & Dragons,"

729
00:32:23,748 --> 00:32:27,699
a-and it's the same basement
I live in now.

730
00:32:27,899 --> 00:32:32,021
Trust me when I say
no one was having sex.

731
00:32:32,671 --> 00:32:34,057
With guys or girls.

732
00:32:34,144 --> 00:32:35,328
Sex was...

733
00:32:36,764 --> 00:32:38,864
Sex was like
the Sunsword.

734
00:32:38,974 --> 00:32:41,584
<i>- ♪ Oh, I, oh, I, oh, ♪</i>

735
00:32:41,671 --> 00:32:44,286
- <i>♪ am I getting through?♪</i>
- It's a magical weapon in the game

736
00:32:44,373 --> 00:32:45,905
that's really hard
to find.

737
00:32:45,992 --> 00:32:48,591
It's basically like a talking
light saber, but...

738
00:32:48,678 --> 00:32:50,731
Never mind,
doesn't matter.

739
00:32:50,875 --> 00:32:52,450
The point is...

740
00:32:52,865 --> 00:32:55,794
sex wasn't
on the table for us.

741
00:32:56,179 --> 00:32:59,864
So I didn't know
I was gay.

742
00:32:59,993 --> 00:33:03,256
I-I knew that
I had feelings for boys,

743
00:33:03,343 --> 00:33:05,052
but I didn't
understand it.

744
00:33:05,139 --> 00:33:07,432
<i>♪ Could change your mind ♪</i>

745
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:09,346
Not until
you kissed me.

746
00:33:09,491 --> 00:33:11,548
You kissed me,

747
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:15,146
and I felt
the opposite of shame.

748
00:33:15,233 --> 00:33:19,028
I felt like I existed,

749
00:33:19,764 --> 00:33:21,797
and everything
fell in place.

750
00:33:21,884 --> 00:33:23,856
For the first time,
it felt like

751
00:33:23,943 --> 00:33:26,774
I was holding the Sunsword,
and I kno...

752
00:33:26,925 --> 00:33:28,972
<i>♪ Oh, maybe I can... ♪</i>

753
00:33:29,094 --> 00:33:30,974
Are... Are... Are...
Are you just kissing me

754
00:33:31,061 --> 00:33:32,622
to get me
to stop talking?

755
00:33:32,709 --> 00:33:34,567
<i>- ♪ But, oh, maybe ♪</i>
- No.

756
00:33:34,654 --> 00:33:38,989
<i>♪ I can change your miiiiind ♪</i>

757
00:33:39,083 --> 00:33:42,669
<i>♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh ♪

758
00:33:42,756 --> 00:33:45,077
<i>♪ Can I change your mind? ♪</i>

759
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:49,778
<i>♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ♪</i>

760
00:33:49,976 --> 00:33:51,421
Hey.

761
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,637
Look, I know...

762
00:33:52,724 --> 00:33:54,309
I probably shouldn't have
said all that to Cece,

763
00:33:54,396 --> 00:33:55,684
and I-I get it if you're mad,

764
00:33:55,771 --> 00:33:57,630
- but I-I had to say...
- It was brave.

765
00:33:57,982 --> 00:33:59,654
Not many doctors
are brave enough

766
00:33:59,741 --> 00:34:01,349
to tell
that kind of truth.

767
00:34:01,582 --> 00:34:03,466
You impress me, DeLuca.

768
00:34:04,218 --> 00:34:06,638
Well, you amaze me,
Dr. Grey.

769
00:34:07,032 --> 00:34:09,122
And while
I'm feeling brave,

770
00:34:09,427 --> 00:34:11,244
I'm not sorry I kissed you
at the wedding.

771
00:34:11,331 --> 00:34:13,321
'Cause it's all I've been able
to think about ever since,

772
00:34:13,408 --> 00:34:15,682
and... I know
you have options,

773
00:34:15,769 --> 00:34:18,845
but... I want you to know
that I'm one of them.

774
00:34:19,616 --> 00:34:21,331
I am your attending.

775
00:34:21,418 --> 00:34:22,834
- No, no, no.
- Don't do that, okay?

776
00:34:22,921 --> 00:34:24,759
This isn't some kind
of abuse of power.

777
00:34:24,846 --> 00:34:27,025
I'm not an intern.
I'm a senior resident.

778
00:34:27,147 --> 00:34:28,407
You dated my sister.

779
00:34:28,494 --> 00:34:31,525
Maggie doesn't care.
Like, deeply doesn't care.

780
00:34:32,213 --> 00:34:33,487
DeLuca.

781
00:34:33,574 --> 00:34:34,894
Meredith.

782
00:34:35,766 --> 00:34:36,980
Andrew.

783
00:34:37,523 --> 00:34:38,668
Look...

784
00:34:39,513 --> 00:34:41,019
I think
there's something here,

785
00:34:41,106 --> 00:34:44,048
and we can keep going through
all the excuses of why not,

786
00:34:44,135 --> 00:34:46,845
but I think
you feel it, too.

787
00:34:48,769 --> 00:34:50,587
I'm having such a week.

788
00:34:51,724 --> 00:34:53,610
I don't trust my thinking.

789
00:34:54,675 --> 00:34:57,157
So I'm gonna walk
out of here, okay?

790
00:34:57,824 --> 00:34:59,767
But I'm gonna think
about what you said...

791
00:34:59,854 --> 00:35:01,985
when I'm able
to think.

792
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:04,380
Okay?

793
00:35:04,473 --> 00:35:05,614
Okay.

794
00:35:06,974 --> 00:35:08,133
Okay.

795
00:35:15,433 --> 00:35:17,596
Cheers.
To our second honeymoon.

796
00:35:17,683 --> 00:35:18,856
Cheers.

797
00:35:20,014 --> 00:35:21,051
Mmm.

798
00:35:21,145 --> 00:35:22,153
Ahh.

799
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,272
Beer tastes better
in this.

800
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:24,300
If we keep
all the gifts,

801
00:35:24,387 --> 00:35:26,197
does that mean we have
to write thank-you notes?

802
00:35:26,284 --> 00:35:27,557
- Not it.
- Not it.

803
00:35:29,653 --> 00:35:32,846
I don't care about the license.
I feel married.

804
00:35:33,239 --> 00:35:34,591
Me, too.

805
00:35:35,286 --> 00:35:37,003
But we should still
mail it in.

806
00:35:37,090 --> 00:35:38,426
Yeah.

807
00:35:43,802 --> 00:35:45,252
Louie's fine?

808
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:48,718
He... He was an appetizer
on a festive toothpick.

809
00:35:48,805 --> 00:35:51,440
Yes, and, surprisingly,
nothing vital was pierced.

810
00:35:51,527 --> 00:35:53,775
- He needs to rest, okay?
- Ohh.

811
00:35:53,862 --> 00:35:56,533
Stay quiet
for several weeks or so.

812
00:35:58,328 --> 00:36:02,104
I know it sounds like we hate
each other, the way we go at it,

813
00:36:02,413 --> 00:36:05,700
but I have loved him
every day

814
00:36:05,787 --> 00:36:08,776
of the 45 years
we've been together.

815
00:36:08,989 --> 00:36:13,088
But still,
that's 45 years of marriage.

816
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:17,291
I mean, we would have never
made it without fighting.

817
00:36:17,378 --> 00:36:20,253
Louie... he likes
a dramatic exit,

818
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:23,346
but he scared me
half to death today,

819
00:36:23,433 --> 00:36:25,005
because...

820
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:26,971
because, you see,

821
00:36:27,058 --> 00:36:28,776
he always comes back.

822
00:36:29,676 --> 00:36:34,315
No matter the fight,
he would... he would come back.

823
00:36:35,551 --> 00:36:36,919
Thank you.

824
00:36:37,091 --> 00:36:38,411
Mm-hmm.

825
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:02,981
I am gonna re-read
this entire thing,

826
00:37:03,068 --> 00:37:04,715
and then I'm gonna
get a new sponsor.

827
00:37:04,802 --> 00:37:08,223
Well, I think that
is an excellent idea.

828
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:09,661
'Cause I'm pretty sure

829
00:37:09,748 --> 00:37:13,098
my wife is having an affair
with Tom Koracick,

830
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:16,255
and I'm afraid, if I don't
get a little more serenity

831
00:37:16,342 --> 00:37:17,791
than I already have
right now,

832
00:37:17,878 --> 00:37:19,411
that I'll kill someone

833
00:37:19,498 --> 00:37:21,910
and go back to jail
for good.

834
00:37:21,999 --> 00:37:23,826
Catherine and Koracick?

835
00:37:23,913 --> 00:37:26,473
Well, not everyone
is Bailey and Warren.

836
00:37:28,171 --> 00:37:29,473
Ben and I...

837
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:32,793
aren't sleeping
in the same house right now.

838
00:37:34,288 --> 00:37:36,332
I asked
for a sabbatical.

839
00:37:36,459 --> 00:37:39,896
You don't take a sabbatical
from a marriage.

840
00:37:39,983 --> 00:37:41,652
You take it from a job.

841
00:37:41,749 --> 00:37:44,543
I worry
every minute of the day

842
00:37:44,788 --> 00:37:47,724
about whether
he was suffocating

843
00:37:47,811 --> 00:37:50,276
from too much
carbon monoxide,

844
00:37:50,624 --> 00:37:52,637
blowing up
in a burning building,

845
00:37:52,842 --> 00:37:55,215
or falling off
a stupid ladder.

846
00:37:56,176 --> 00:37:58,927
I worried
about him dying.

847
00:37:59,014 --> 00:38:00,957
A-And all that stopped just

848
00:38:01,044 --> 00:38:03,402
because you asked him
to leave?

849
00:38:04,266 --> 00:38:06,340
And you're not
worried anymore?

850
00:38:07,725 --> 00:38:10,637
You gave up your job
and your husband.

851
00:38:10,724 --> 00:38:12,598
What's next... Tuck?

852
00:38:12,888 --> 00:38:15,410
Bailey, you're trying to fix
the inside from the outside,

853
00:38:15,497 --> 00:38:18,918
and I know because
my insides are a damn mess.

854
00:38:19,810 --> 00:38:22,160
You need to
get some help, Bailey.

855
00:38:28,071 --> 00:38:29,290
Hi.

856
00:38:30,152 --> 00:38:31,541
You got a minute?

857
00:38:36,194 --> 00:38:38,279
Been thinking
about yesterday.

858
00:38:39,539 --> 00:38:44,076
That was kind of the first big
fight we've ever really had.

859
00:38:59,172 --> 00:39:01,068
Jackson, I-I don't know
how to say this.

860
00:39:01,155 --> 00:39:03,459
No, it's okay.
You don't have to say anything.

861
00:39:08,258 --> 00:39:09,719
Maggie.

862
00:39:16,782 --> 00:39:18,342
Jackson, I'm so sorry.
