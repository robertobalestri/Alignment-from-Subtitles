00:00:02,403 --> 00:00:04,080
<i>Previously on</i> Grey's Anatomy...

2
00:00:04,104 --> 00:00:05,224
Webber has singled you out?

3
00:00:05,272 --> 00:00:06,316
Yeah, anointed me.

4
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:07,439
He knows about us.

5
00:00:07,507 --> 00:00:08,747
Oh! I'm so screwed!

6
00:00:08,809 --> 00:00:10,020
Maggie, I told him
you were a wildcat.

7
00:00:10,044 --> 00:00:11,044
What?

8
00:00:11,094 --> 00:00:12,374
Blake should be in our surgery.

9
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:13,907
Callie, stop. No, I am sorry,

10
00:00:13,931 --> 00:00:15,993
but I can't just stand here
and... You're embarrassing me!

11
00:00:16,017 --> 00:00:17,649
Stay out of it.

12
00:00:17,718 --> 00:00:20,385
If you want to start
over, let's do it.

13
00:00:20,453 --> 00:00:22,213
Just like new? Square one.

14
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:25,023
What are you doing?

15
00:00:25,092 --> 00:00:27,943
I barely know you. At least
ask me out on a date first.

16
00:00:28,012 --> 00:00:29,528
Did Arizona tell you...

17
00:00:29,596 --> 00:00:31,408
I worked in peds.
I figured it out.

18
00:00:31,432 --> 00:00:32,659
How far along are
you? Nine weeks.

19
00:00:32,683 --> 00:00:34,716
He doesn't know? Not yet.

20
00:00:34,785 --> 00:00:38,587
Behold. Everything the
light touches is yours.

21
00:00:38,655 --> 00:00:42,023
Congratulations, Chief.

22
00:00:42,092 --> 00:00:44,158
Meredith, you got really
good at being alone.

23
00:00:44,227 --> 00:00:46,511
Are you saying I can't
be alone anymore?

24
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:47,679
No, I think you can.

25
00:00:47,748 --> 00:00:49,148
I just don't think
you want to be.

26
00:00:58,526 --> 00:01:00,059
<i>Back in med school,</i>

27
00:01:00,127 --> 00:01:02,039
<i>I knew a guy who spent
his weekends as a magician</i>

28
00:01:02,063 --> 00:01:04,196
<i>for children's birthday parties.</i>

29
00:01:04,265 --> 00:01:08,399
Okay, this is only a dry
run, and it's the first of many.

30
00:01:08,468 --> 00:01:10,429
Won't be perfect,
but once we start,

31
00:01:10,453 --> 00:01:12,466
I don't want to stop until
we get to the other side.

32
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:13,810
Agreed? Okay.

33
00:01:15,292 --> 00:01:17,142
Let's go. Yep.

34
00:01:17,211 --> 00:01:19,293
<i>It makes a weird kind of sense.</i>

35
00:01:19,362 --> 00:01:21,357
<i>If you plan on sawing
a person in half,</i>

36
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:23,301
<i>you're going to
need to practice.</i>

37
00:01:26,353 --> 00:01:29,070
<i>When you take the stage
and all eyes are on you,</i>

38
00:01:29,139 --> 00:01:30,967
<i>you don't want the
audience to see you sweat.</i>

39
00:01:30,991 --> 00:01:32,569
Three days ago,
I received a call

40
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:34,473
from a colleague
at Bauer Medical,

41
00:01:34,528 --> 00:01:37,445
<i>a military facility just
outside of Seattle.</i>

42
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:40,949
A consult was requested
for a 35-year-old male patient

43
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:43,329
with an osteosarcoma
of the left pelvis,

44
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:44,865
lumbar spine, and sacrum.

45
00:01:44,889 --> 00:01:46,816
<i>You only want them
to see the magic.</i>

46
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,607
Whoa! Seconded.

47
00:01:48,676 --> 00:01:50,387
<i>Traditionally, a tumor like this</i>

48
00:01:50,411 --> 00:01:53,528
<i>would be approached with
aggressive chemoradiation</i>

49
00:01:53,597 --> 00:01:56,392
that would give him a
few years to live, at most.

50
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:58,060
There's got to be
something better than that.

51
00:01:58,084 --> 00:01:59,551
Torres thought so, too.

52
00:02:00,754 --> 00:02:01,937
<i>She had a better idea.</i>

53
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:08,326
<i>Torres' plan was to use
the vascularized fibular grafts</i>

54
00:02:08,395 --> 00:02:10,262
<i>from the amputated leg</i>

55
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:13,130
<i>to attach the right leg and
pelvis to the spine at the midline.</i>

56
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,920
This would provide axial
stability, and potentially...

57
00:02:20,741 --> 00:02:21,773
Okay.

58
00:02:23,127 --> 00:02:24,876
The ability to walk.

59
00:02:24,945 --> 00:02:26,022
That's...

60
00:02:26,046 --> 00:02:27,766
Impressive? Insane.

61
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:31,450
And I mean that in the best way.

62
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:35,604
What did we just do?

63
00:02:37,307 --> 00:02:38,667
A miracle.

64
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:52,754
It's a solid plan, Torres.
You should be proud.

65
00:02:52,823 --> 00:02:53,955
I am.

66
00:02:54,024 --> 00:02:55,334
But we still have
a few days left,

67
00:02:55,358 --> 00:02:57,069
so I'd like to run
through it twice tomorrow,

68
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:58,638
see if we can get our time down.

69
00:02:58,662 --> 00:02:59,995
Right. But first, sleep.

70
00:03:00,063 --> 00:03:01,608
Yeah, all the sleep I can carry.

71
00:03:01,632 --> 00:03:03,615
Folks, hang on.
We have a problem.

72
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:06,145
Colonel Miller just called
from Bauer Medical.

73
00:03:06,169 --> 00:03:09,348
Our patient just took a fall
and has fractured his pelvis.

74
00:03:09,372 --> 00:03:11,117
What? OWEN: Our
timeline has changed.

75
00:03:11,141 --> 00:03:12,986
His fractured pelvis has
compromised blood flow

76
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:14,854
to the leg we need to salvage.

77
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:16,845
Our window's closing.

78
00:03:16,914 --> 00:03:18,308
If we wait, there
won't be anything left

79
00:03:18,332 --> 00:03:19,542
to use in the reconstruction.

80
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:20,994
Okay, well, when
do they want to do it?

81
00:03:21,018 --> 00:03:22,267
Tonight.

82
00:03:25,072 --> 00:03:27,589
Would've liked
another run-through.

83
00:03:27,658 --> 00:03:28,790
Okay, when... When...

84
00:03:28,859 --> 00:03:30,387
When can he come? He's not.

85
00:03:30,411 --> 00:03:32,105
After the fall, the patient's
not stable enough to move.

86
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:33,757
We have to go to
him. It's an away game.

87
00:03:33,781 --> 00:03:35,079
It's an away game.

88
00:03:35,733 --> 00:03:37,949
It's not even fair.

89
00:03:38,018 --> 00:03:40,196
I mean, no one else got a
chance to volunteer to go.

90
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,220
What can I say?
I'm good at ortho,

91
00:03:42,289 --> 00:03:44,183
I'm good at plastics.
I'm a switch-hitter.

92
00:03:44,207 --> 00:03:46,135
I'm an integral
part of the team.

93
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,803
Wilson did the only trial run.

94
00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:49,105
Of course I would
rather take you.

95
00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:51,112
I'm kind of stuck here.

96
00:03:52,216 --> 00:03:53,493
Whatever. I still get to go.

97
00:03:53,517 --> 00:03:54,977
Now, listen, about Bauer.

98
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:56,345
Bye! Military
hospitals are a mix

99
00:03:56,369 --> 00:03:58,114
of civilian and military doctors

100
00:03:58,138 --> 00:04:00,283
with a very strict
idea about hierarchy.

101
00:04:00,307 --> 00:04:02,457
Okay, Hunt, I get it.
These are your people.

102
00:04:02,526 --> 00:04:03,858
We'll do you proud.

103
00:04:05,062 --> 00:04:06,411
Take me with you.

104
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,324
I thought you didn't want
me messing in your career.

105
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:11,049
Maybe just this once. This
surgery's gonna be amazing.

106
00:04:11,117 --> 00:04:12,917
Sorry, Blake. No
special treatment.

107
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:14,666
Same thing I tell my husband.

108
00:04:15,121 --> 00:04:16,471
Hunt! We got incoming.

109
00:04:16,539 --> 00:04:18,179
Be right there. Good luck!

110
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:27,933
You know Curt Morgan?
The neuro-ophthalmologist?

111
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:30,797
I do, yeah. He's a nice guy.

112
00:04:30,821 --> 00:04:32,053
He is a nice guy.

113
00:04:32,121 --> 00:04:33,805
And he was asking about you.

114
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:39,027
Bailey. I'm just
saying he was asking.

115
00:04:39,113 --> 00:04:40,623
Who was asking about what?

116
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:42,648
Oh, uh, Curt Morgan
was asking about Dr. Grey.

117
00:04:42,716 --> 00:04:44,327
Wilson. Oh. Curt.
Yeah, he's great.

118
00:04:44,351 --> 00:04:45,745
We play ball with him
on Wednesday nights.

119
00:04:45,769 --> 00:04:48,130
Okay, what about we stop
talking about Curt Morgan

120
00:04:48,154 --> 00:04:49,649
and focus on what we have to do?

121
00:04:49,673 --> 00:04:52,802
Or we could talk about the
fact that he's tall and handsome,

122
00:04:52,826 --> 00:04:55,855
divorced, funny, doesn't
have kids... Handsome.

123
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:56,999
You said handsome twice.

124
00:04:57,047 --> 00:04:58,287
That wasn't an accident.

125
00:05:03,837 --> 00:05:05,581
Hey, remember,
we're guests here.

126
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:07,383
Hunt wants us on
our best behavior.

127
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:09,018
I've spent a lot of time
working with the military.

128
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:10,286
If we're respectful
and do our jobs,

129
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,230
we won't ruffle
any feathers. Okay.

130
00:05:12,595 --> 00:05:14,506
Dr. Bailey. Colonel Miller.

131
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:16,831
So nice to finally put
a face with the voice.

132
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:17,900
Likewise.

133
00:05:17,968 --> 00:05:19,517
This is Captain Vaughn. Hi.

134
00:05:19,586 --> 00:05:21,414
She's here to help make sure
you have everything that you...

135
00:05:21,438 --> 00:05:23,722
Colonel, what the hell?

136
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:26,140
Dr. Bailey, this is
Major Thorpe. He's...

137
00:05:26,209 --> 00:05:27,726
I'm Sergeant Carson's surgeon.

138
00:05:29,396 --> 00:05:31,763
And you are... The "Dream Team"?

139
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:35,345
You can't just make
decisions for my patient.

140
00:05:35,369 --> 00:05:37,380
Oh, we're not here to
step on toes, Doctor.

141
00:05:37,404 --> 00:05:39,821
You're here to make
my patient a guinea pig.

142
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:41,584
How about we take a step back?

143
00:05:41,608 --> 00:05:44,053
How about you take 10
steps back, through that door,

144
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:46,255
because no one's touching my patient!
- Thorpe.

145
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:50,599
Sir, I understand that you
want what's best for your patient.

146
00:05:50,667 --> 00:05:53,434
Is the surgery new
and risky? Yes, it is.

147
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,803
But if it works...

148
00:05:54,888 --> 00:05:56,238
Oh, It'll work.

149
00:05:56,306 --> 00:05:57,750
Major Thorpe, your
chief asked for our help

150
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:58,985
because he knows we're the best.

151
00:05:59,009 --> 00:06:00,286
Now, you called
us the Dream Team,

152
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:02,806
and that's exactly what we
are. We are miracle workers.

153
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:04,724
Now, the sooner
you recognize that,

154
00:06:04,748 --> 00:06:07,811
the sooner we can get to
the business of saving a life,

155
00:06:07,835 --> 00:06:11,475
which is all any of us are
here to do, yourself included.

156
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:14,239
If you'll all follow me.

157
00:06:18,061 --> 00:06:20,006
I think you may have
ruffled some feathers.

158
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:22,441
"Miracle workers"? You
think maybe you overdid that?

159
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:24,344
We've practiced
once, Torres. Once.

160
00:06:24,368 --> 00:06:26,446
I might've gotten a little
carried away. A little?

161
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:27,802
We're so screwed.

162
00:06:47,758 --> 00:06:50,291
Karev wants me in the ER.

163
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,661
Look, I'm on call all night,

164
00:06:52,729 --> 00:06:53,969
but if it's slow, I mean,

165
00:06:54,031 --> 00:06:56,142
I could meet you back
here in a couple hours.

166
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:57,465
Sounds tempting.

167
00:07:02,472 --> 00:07:04,322
Ah, Pierce, there you are.

168
00:07:04,391 --> 00:07:05,631
Yes, Riggs, here I am.

169
00:07:05,692 --> 00:07:07,125
Wanted to see
about getting you in

170
00:07:07,194 --> 00:07:08,676
on an elective
VATS in the morning.

171
00:07:08,745 --> 00:07:09,985
Yeah, absolutely.

172
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:12,253
That is a two-hander,
so let's do it.

173
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:16,200
So I'm gonna put you
down for 9:30, yeah?

174
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:18,189
Mmm-hmm. Cool. Cheers.

175
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:22,273
That was close.

176
00:07:22,342 --> 00:07:24,175
Are we still doing this?

177
00:07:24,244 --> 00:07:26,077
Yes. Because it's a secret,

178
00:07:26,146 --> 00:07:28,291
and that's what you do with
secrets. You keep them secret.

179
00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:29,614
Yeah, but what's the point?

180
00:07:29,683 --> 00:07:31,883
Look, your sisters
know, Webber knows.

181
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:34,185
It's getting a little
old, honestly, okay?

182
00:07:34,254 --> 00:07:35,465
And... And I got
to get out of here.

183
00:07:35,489 --> 00:07:37,649
Karev's paged me
three times already.

184
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:40,259
Coming through.

185
00:07:41,327 --> 00:07:43,828
Clear the way!

186
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:46,142
DeLuca, where the hell have
you been? Grab me some Kerlix.

187
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:48,616
Lisa. Have you seen
Lisa? She's our captain.

188
00:07:48,685 --> 00:07:50,596
Let me guess.
Ponytail, hair bow?

189
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,220
God, she's gonna be so mad.

190
00:07:52,289 --> 00:07:53,655
We didn't stick the final pose,

191
00:07:53,724 --> 00:07:55,089
and it wasn't even that hard.

192
00:07:55,158 --> 00:07:57,876
It was just a 13-person
synchronized Liberty Twist.

193
00:07:57,944 --> 00:07:58,993
Thirteen? Wow.

194
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:00,640
Pulse is over 130.

195
00:08:00,664 --> 00:08:02,942
Run an EKG and a metabolic
panel and add a detox.

196
00:08:02,966 --> 00:08:04,816
Nobody was
listening to each other.

197
00:08:04,885 --> 00:08:06,195
Danielle hit her trick too soon,

198
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:07,997
so everyone else
had to match, and...

199
00:08:08,021 --> 00:08:09,265
All right, just try to
calm down a little, okay?

200
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:11,556
Are you kidding? We
were in the final round!

201
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:14,909
We were about to
qualify for Nationals!

202
00:08:14,978 --> 00:08:16,422
Slight tenderness
to the abdomen,

203
00:08:16,446 --> 00:08:18,541
but I want to do an ultrasound
to make sure everything is okay.

204
00:08:18,565 --> 00:08:20,315
Oh, my God. Dani, are you okay?

205
00:08:20,383 --> 00:08:22,049
Everything hurts.

206
00:08:22,118 --> 00:08:23,902
I can't believe this. I...

207
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:26,048
I can't... Hey, Maxine,
are you a little dizzy?

208
00:08:26,072 --> 00:08:27,489
Maxine? I am.

209
00:08:28,558 --> 00:08:31,392
My life is over.

210
00:08:34,364 --> 00:08:35,430
Coming through!

211
00:08:35,498 --> 00:08:36,675
Page neuro. No telling how hard

212
00:08:36,699 --> 00:08:37,709
she hit her head when she fell.

213
00:08:37,733 --> 00:08:39,367
Her BP's through the roof.

214
00:08:42,739 --> 00:08:44,617
And you understand the risks

215
00:08:44,641 --> 00:08:46,957
of the surgery that
we're talking about?

216
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:49,093
I've explained
the risk in detail.

217
00:08:49,162 --> 00:08:51,362
Yeah, he won't shut
up about the risk.

218
00:08:51,431 --> 00:08:53,392
He's explained the
benefits, too, I hope.

219
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:56,078
And keep in mind, with some
aggressive chemo and radiation,

220
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:58,669
you've got a chance at
a couple of good years.

221
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:01,067
And with our approach,
you have a shot at a full life.

222
00:09:01,091 --> 00:09:03,251
Many... THORPE:
Brian, you're sick.

223
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:06,677
I'm not convinced you can
withstand this kind of surgery.

224
00:09:06,747 --> 00:09:09,247
You roll the dice on this one,

225
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:11,499
we could lose you
on the table tonight.

226
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:18,556
Listen, I've spent five tours
of duty, all around the world.

227
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:20,708
I missed the births
of both my girls.

228
00:09:20,777 --> 00:09:22,377
I have another one on the way.

229
00:09:23,964 --> 00:09:25,897
I want the life
I've been missing.

230
00:09:28,685 --> 00:09:31,252
If you can give me that,

231
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:34,272
well, I'm all in.

232
00:09:36,843 --> 00:09:38,843
Well? We're a go.

233
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,259
Your work better be
as good as your talk.

234
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:43,314
Dr. Thorpe, we'll
see you in the OR.

235
00:09:43,382 --> 00:09:45,427
Let's not waste any more
time. We need to get to the OR.

236
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:46,818
And Dr. Avery needs to be shown

237
00:09:46,887 --> 00:09:48,264
where he can set up for
the bone-graft harvest.

238
00:09:48,288 --> 00:09:49,437
Yep.

239
00:09:51,474 --> 00:09:53,308
We're really doing this?

240
00:09:53,376 --> 00:09:55,176
It's gonna be great.

241
00:10:01,384 --> 00:10:03,918
Okay. Okay, this will work.

242
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:06,104
I'm glad you think so.

243
00:10:06,173 --> 00:10:07,483
Do you see everything you need?

244
00:10:07,507 --> 00:10:09,268
Uh, you know, I need
a Bovie in here, please.

245
00:10:09,292 --> 00:10:11,532
I'll grab it if you
let me watch.

246
00:10:11,894 --> 00:10:13,994
The bone-graft retrieval.

247
00:10:14,063 --> 00:10:15,983
Sorry, we're a
military hospital.

248
00:10:16,049 --> 00:10:18,733
I see mostly trauma-related
patch-up jobs.

249
00:10:18,802 --> 00:10:22,119
You have a reputation for a
much more refined approach.

250
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:23,822
My reputation? I
have a reputation?

251
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:26,341
I Googled you.

252
00:10:26,409 --> 00:10:27,920
I mean, I Googled all of you.

253
00:10:27,944 --> 00:10:30,177
Everyone's really
excited about the surgery.

254
00:10:30,247 --> 00:10:31,512
We don't get a lot of chances

255
00:10:31,581 --> 00:10:34,632
to see someone with
your level of expertise.

256
00:10:34,701 --> 00:10:37,035
Um... You know what? Yeah. Sure.

257
00:10:37,104 --> 00:10:38,104
You can watch.

258
00:10:38,939 --> 00:10:40,071
Thank you.

259
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,300
I'll be right back
with that Bovie.

260
00:10:44,177 --> 00:10:46,477
Could she flirt any harder?

261
00:10:46,546 --> 00:10:48,157
What? Nobody's
flirting with anybody.

262
00:10:48,181 --> 00:10:50,197
Oh, come on. "I Googled you?"

263
00:10:50,267 --> 00:10:52,900
She was totally
flirting. So were you.

264
00:10:52,969 --> 00:10:54,847
I was not! What did I even say?

265
00:10:54,871 --> 00:10:56,521
You didn't have to say anything.

266
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:59,006
All of this is a flirt.

267
00:11:03,547 --> 00:11:05,930
I'm gonna need you to be still.

268
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:08,533
I mean, she barely
even looks hurt

269
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:11,486
when my face is split open.

270
00:11:11,554 --> 00:11:13,504
Maxine screwed us.

271
00:11:13,573 --> 00:11:14,884
Danielle's the one
who threw us off.

272
00:11:14,908 --> 00:11:16,119
She didn't put her
weight in her heel

273
00:11:16,143 --> 00:11:18,109
when she knows she has to... Ow!

274
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:19,893
What? Are you trying
to break it more?

275
00:11:19,963 --> 00:11:21,496
I am so over them.

276
00:11:21,581 --> 00:11:24,249
We have worked too hard
and sacrificed too much

277
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:27,451
to let Maxine and Dani
humiliate us like that.

278
00:11:28,088 --> 00:11:29,804
They are out.

279
00:11:29,873 --> 00:11:30,938
Down.

280
00:11:31,007 --> 00:11:32,407
Done. Hashtag that.

281
00:11:33,677 --> 00:11:36,844
That girl is the reason
I hated high school.

282
00:11:36,913 --> 00:11:38,029
What a power trip.

283
00:11:38,098 --> 00:11:39,592
She can't just kick
somebody off the team.

284
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:41,461
Are you kidding me?
She's the power center here.

285
00:11:41,485 --> 00:11:44,586
She's cheer captain
and squad leader.

286
00:11:44,654 --> 00:11:46,087
What's the difference?

287
00:11:48,157 --> 00:11:49,685
You see the way
they all look at her.

288
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,354
She's the top of the
social food chain.

289
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:54,245
She calls all the shots,
decides who's in, who's out.

290
00:11:54,314 --> 00:11:56,208
She says jump, they
ask, "Off which bridge?"

291
00:11:56,232 --> 00:11:58,472
How do you know all this?

292
00:11:59,035 --> 00:12:00,635
'Cause I was squad leader.

293
00:12:01,738 --> 00:12:03,505
It was exhausting.

294
00:12:03,573 --> 00:12:05,918
You were the reason
I hated high school.

295
00:12:05,942 --> 00:12:07,408
I actually loved high school.

296
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:09,255
I bet. Everybody loved
high school in the '50s.

297
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,023
Yep. I will send
someone right up.

298
00:12:11,047 --> 00:12:12,380
That was psych.

299
00:12:12,449 --> 00:12:13,959
One of their patients
needs a surgical consult.

300
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:15,027
Oh, dibs! Me, please!

301
00:12:15,051 --> 00:12:16,134
Come on. Shoot for it.

302
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:18,448
Bam! Warren, head up to psych

303
00:12:18,472 --> 00:12:19,632
and bring Spencer with you. Yes!

304
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:21,576
What the hell? I'm on it.

305
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:25,910
Maybe we could intubate them.

306
00:12:25,979 --> 00:12:27,611
Mmm.

307
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,065
They would be so, so quiet.

308
00:12:31,133 --> 00:12:33,062
Maxine, can you
touch your nose for me?

309
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:36,320
Are they talking about
me? Lisa and Chelsea?

310
00:12:36,373 --> 00:12:39,051
I know they are. They're
always talking about someone.

311
00:12:39,075 --> 00:12:40,075
Other hand, please.

312
00:12:40,143 --> 00:12:41,476
I've been trying so hard

313
00:12:41,544 --> 00:12:43,255
just to make the team
a team, you know?

314
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:44,590
Maxine, you're working
yourself up again.

315
00:12:44,614 --> 00:12:46,213
Take some deep breaths.

316
00:12:46,282 --> 00:12:48,294
You can't advance in cheer
if you don't trust each other.

317
00:12:48,318 --> 00:12:50,913
Balance and trust, that's the
foundation. I keep telling them.

318
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:52,548
So maybe I'm a little
bitchy about it. So?

319
00:12:52,572 --> 00:12:54,972
It's not like Lisa isn't bitchy
every single day of her life.

320
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:58,326
Wow, that was all one breath.

321
00:12:58,395 --> 00:13:00,361
Your neuro exam is clear.

322
00:13:00,429 --> 00:13:02,447
I'd like to get a head
CT just to be safe.

323
00:13:03,933 --> 00:13:05,466
I just wanted us to win.

324
00:13:06,987 --> 00:13:08,236
What's so bad about that?

325
00:13:08,304 --> 00:13:11,083
For starters, you're 17
with the BP of a 50-year-old.

326
00:13:11,107 --> 00:13:13,547
Nothing too good about that.

327
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,321
Never been up to psych before.

328
00:13:15,345 --> 00:13:17,389
To be clear, I didn't actually
go to school in the '50s.

329
00:13:17,413 --> 00:13:18,924
It's dark up here.

330
00:13:18,948 --> 00:13:20,181
Smells weird.

331
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,516
I mean, I know I'm
older, but I'm not old.

332
00:13:22,585 --> 00:13:24,685
Patients keep screaming.

333
00:13:24,754 --> 00:13:25,987
Patients keep screaming.

334
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:30,608
Dr. Siegel, right?

335
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,304
You called for an
abdominal consult?

336
00:13:32,328 --> 00:13:33,962
Yeah, right here.

337
00:13:34,047 --> 00:13:35,741
I was doing his intake, and he
just started clutching his stomach.

338
00:13:35,765 --> 00:13:37,015
Sir? Sir? Can you hear me?

339
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:38,323
He's non-communicative.

340
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:40,601
Pulse is 130 and
thready. I think he's...

341
00:13:40,687 --> 00:13:41,869
Yep. He's crashing.

342
00:13:41,938 --> 00:13:43,858
Should we take him out of here?

343
00:13:45,242 --> 00:13:46,482
I can't get a pressure.

344
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:52,024
Yeah, he's bleeding into
his belly from a triple-A.

345
00:13:52,048 --> 00:13:53,092
We need to get him into the OR.

346
00:13:53,116 --> 00:13:54,415
I think I lost his pulse.

347
00:13:54,483 --> 00:13:56,228
He's not gonna
make it to surgery.

348
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:57,530
I'm just gonna have to
open him up right here.

349
00:13:57,554 --> 00:13:59,364
Oh, that's not going to happen.

350
00:13:59,388 --> 00:14:01,250
I need a thoracotomy
tray, a crash cart, and blood,

351
00:14:01,274 --> 00:14:03,040
and a scalpel, now.

352
00:14:06,896 --> 00:14:08,357
There is nothing
here! There's no...

353
00:14:08,381 --> 00:14:10,476
This is the psych ward.
There's nothing sharp here.

354
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,578
- There's nothing sharp here!
- It's not allowed.

355
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:13,767
You got to be kidding me.

356
00:14:13,836 --> 00:14:15,314
Look, go find me
something I can cut with!

357
00:14:15,338 --> 00:14:16,816
You don't think maybe we
should wait for an attending?

358
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,950
Wait. You're not an attending?

359
00:14:17,974 --> 00:14:19,214
Spencer, get me a scalpel now!

360
00:14:19,242 --> 00:14:20,407
Okay, yeah.

361
00:14:24,413 --> 00:14:26,242
I'm not feeling good
about this, Torres.

362
00:14:26,266 --> 00:14:28,777
I don't like walking into a
surgery where I'm not feeling good.

363
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:29,846
You feeling good, Grey?

364
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,702
We practiced it once.

365
00:14:31,771 --> 00:14:33,532
We're about to pull an
all-nighter. Sure. Feeling great.

366
00:14:33,556 --> 00:14:35,134
Everything's gonna
be fine, you guys.

367
00:14:35,158 --> 00:14:36,502
We just have to be
squirrels about this.

368
00:14:36,526 --> 00:14:38,137
Couldn't have heard
you correctly there.

369
00:14:38,161 --> 00:14:39,460
You know, squirrels...

370
00:14:39,529 --> 00:14:41,111
They store nuts
for the winter, right?

371
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,625
But they don't do it all at once.
They do it one nut at a time.

372
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:45,394
Everyone has their part to play,

373
00:14:45,418 --> 00:14:46,878
so everyone just needs
to handle their own nut.

374
00:14:46,902 --> 00:14:48,519
We do that, we get all the nuts.

375
00:14:48,587 --> 00:14:49,782
- Makes sense.
- Does it, though?

376
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:50,916
All right, if we're doing this,

377
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,306
let's not waste any more time.

378
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:53,652
Yeah, Thorpe, can
you give us one minute?

379
00:14:53,676 --> 00:14:56,036
I need to confer with my team.

380
00:14:57,731 --> 00:14:59,130
Okay.

381
00:15:01,701 --> 00:15:03,451
Dr. Bailey, are we conferring?

382
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:05,564
We're praying. Torres is right.

383
00:15:05,588 --> 00:15:09,108
We'll be fine if we
each just do our part.

384
00:15:09,175 --> 00:15:12,076
Figure it doesn't hurt
to ask God to do His.

385
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:18,522
Callie, how long do we
stand here doing this?

386
00:15:18,551 --> 00:15:19,900
I don't know. How should I know?

387
00:15:19,969 --> 00:15:21,880
You pray and stuff. I mean,
what's she looking for?

388
00:15:21,904 --> 00:15:23,720
Some kind of sign or something?

389
00:15:23,789 --> 00:15:26,535
If I was, I sure wouldn't
hear it over the two of you.

390
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:28,225
Sorry. Apologies.

391
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:43,724
You told Karev?

392
00:15:43,792 --> 00:15:45,893
You told Karev about
your baby situation

393
00:15:45,961 --> 00:15:47,728
and you haven't
even told Jackson?

394
00:15:47,796 --> 00:15:50,964
I didn't tell Karev
anything. He figured it out.

395
00:15:51,034 --> 00:15:53,379
It's like he could smell
it on me or something.

396
00:15:53,403 --> 00:15:54,946
You can do that if you
spend enough time in peds.

397
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:56,737
Pregnant ladies have a smell.

398
00:15:56,805 --> 00:15:57,949
What?

399
00:15:57,973 --> 00:15:59,306
Oh, calm down. I'm just kidding.

400
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:00,986
How many more people
have to find out about this

401
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:02,993
before you tell...
Find out about what?

402
00:16:04,914 --> 00:16:06,480
Nothing.

403
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:08,549
You two have a secret.

404
00:16:08,618 --> 00:16:10,363
Mmm-mmm. No,
we don't. What is it?

405
00:16:10,387 --> 00:16:12,870
Did you find out about
DeLuca? Come on.

406
00:16:12,939 --> 00:16:15,340
Robbins, you have
hospital gossip.

407
00:16:15,408 --> 00:16:16,819
You're gonna hold out
on me? Mmm-mmm.

408
00:16:16,843 --> 00:16:19,037
Spill. ARIZONA: No,
there's nothing to tell.

409
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:20,978
Whoa. Sorry. I
need a crash cart,

410
00:16:21,047 --> 00:16:22,146
a thoracotomy tray, and...

411
00:16:22,215 --> 00:16:23,247
Spencer.

412
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:24,510
Do you need something?

413
00:16:24,534 --> 00:16:25,716
Yeah, I... I need you.

414
00:16:28,521 --> 00:16:29,999
Where the hell is Mitchell?

415
00:16:30,023 --> 00:16:32,263
I think you should call it.
He's been down a long time.

416
00:16:32,308 --> 00:16:34,268
Shut up. Just shut up, please.

417
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:36,655
I think I got a faint pulse.

418
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:38,863
I think that's your
pulse you're feeling.

419
00:16:38,932 --> 00:16:41,382
I got to open him up
now. If I don't, he's dead.

420
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:43,868
Again, I'm not gonna allow you
to open up a man in my ward.

421
00:16:43,937 --> 00:16:46,218
This is not an OR. You
are not an attending.

422
00:16:46,906 --> 00:16:48,550
What in the hell are you...

423
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:49,690
No. No, no, no.

424
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,508
Are... Are you insane?

425
00:16:51,577 --> 00:16:53,072
Dr. Siegel, this
man is going to die.

426
00:16:53,096 --> 00:16:54,907
You are way out of line
here. And it will be your fault,

427
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:57,142
so please, don't make
me put my hands on you.

428
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:58,666
Are you threatening me now?

429
00:16:58,735 --> 00:17:01,718
Whoa, whoa. No,
no, no! No, no, no!

430
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:04,066
Hey, I found Dr. Webber, and
I go... Okay! Too... Too late.

431
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:05,617
Warren, what are you doing?

432
00:17:05,641 --> 00:17:06,881
Spencer, get over here.

433
00:17:08,477 --> 00:17:10,194
Help me spread
his ribs. Spread his...

434
00:17:10,263 --> 00:17:14,114
Reach in, push your
fingers through his muscles.

435
00:17:14,183 --> 00:17:16,783
Harder! Come on! Do it! Warren!

436
00:17:17,737 --> 00:17:19,915
I got it. I got his
aorta in my hand.

437
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:21,805
Yeah, I got a pulse.

438
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:25,009
Dr. Webber, can... Can
you get an OR for us?

439
00:17:33,168 --> 00:17:35,703
Okay, Callie, you are
good to go up here.

440
00:17:35,771 --> 00:17:39,317
All right. Okay, I just
need to inspect the SI joint,

441
00:17:39,341 --> 00:17:41,403
make sure we're ready
to amputate the left leg

442
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:42,587
with the hemipelvis.

443
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:44,845
Okay. Okay.

444
00:17:44,914 --> 00:17:48,549
Margins are adequate,
and the stasis is achieved.

445
00:17:48,618 --> 00:17:50,017
Landmarks are looking...

446
00:17:51,171 --> 00:17:52,570
Good.

447
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:53,937
Torres?

448
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:56,023
Looking good? CALLIE:
Yep. Yep, yep, yep.

449
00:17:56,109 --> 00:17:57,903
Just... Want to be sure.

450
00:17:57,927 --> 00:17:59,688
'Cause once it's off, it's off.

451
00:17:59,712 --> 00:18:00,878
Excuse me?

452
00:18:00,947 --> 00:18:03,213
Bailey? This looks good, right?

453
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:05,749
Right there.

454
00:18:05,818 --> 00:18:07,885
It's gonna have to come
off one way or the other.

455
00:18:07,954 --> 00:18:09,520
Yes, I know that.

456
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:11,500
It's just, after this, there's
really no turning back.

457
00:18:11,524 --> 00:18:12,856
I mean, none, so...

458
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,592
Torres...

459
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,660
Be a squirrel.

460
00:18:18,965 --> 00:18:19,992
Okay.

461
00:18:20,016 --> 00:18:21,348
Oscillating saw, please.

462
00:18:26,556 --> 00:18:29,923
Owen is completely
serious about starting over.

463
00:18:29,992 --> 00:18:31,408
He wants to take me on a date.

464
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:32,776
Like, a "date" date.

465
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:34,640
Like, no sex, just
dinner and a movie.

466
00:18:34,664 --> 00:18:36,413
Kind of into it.

467
00:18:36,482 --> 00:18:39,867
DeLuca wants to take us public.

468
00:18:39,936 --> 00:18:43,804
God, he wants to hold hands
in the hallway or something.

469
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:45,113
I like holding hands.

470
00:18:45,141 --> 00:18:48,175
What if we hold
hands and make out?

471
00:18:48,244 --> 00:18:50,089
When was the last time
you made out with a guy

472
00:18:50,113 --> 00:18:51,290
without it going any
further than that?

473
00:18:51,314 --> 00:18:53,831
Why do we have
to parade it around?

474
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:55,411
You don't, but
what is the problem?

475
00:18:55,435 --> 00:18:57,435
If DeLuca wants to... Shh, shh!

476
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:59,437
Oh. It's just you.

477
00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:01,004
This still with DeLuca?

478
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:02,656
Yes, "This still."

479
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:04,224
I don't even know
what "this" is,

480
00:19:04,293 --> 00:19:06,893
and I don't need to figure it
out in front of everyone else.

481
00:19:06,962 --> 00:19:08,774
How's our cheerleader?
Well, there's no sign of a bleed.

482
00:19:08,798 --> 00:19:10,042
It looks like a mild concussion.

483
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:11,482
What if it ends?

484
00:19:11,551 --> 00:19:13,651
Then I'm the woman
who dated the pretty boy,

485
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:14,819
and it all fell apart.

486
00:19:15,455 --> 00:19:16,455
We done here?

487
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:18,356
Who will take me seriously then?

488
00:19:18,424 --> 00:19:20,452
Yeah, I'm... I'm supposed to
take you seriously right now?

489
00:19:20,476 --> 00:19:22,777
I'm a very serious person!

490
00:19:26,616 --> 00:19:27,696
Incredible.

491
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:30,501
Excuse me?

492
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:31,810
Just your technique,

493
00:19:31,871 --> 00:19:34,004
the way you
preserve the vessels.

494
00:19:34,073 --> 00:19:35,806
It's really smooth.

495
00:19:37,944 --> 00:19:39,844
Sorry. I...

496
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:42,792
I have a patient I should
check on. But I'll be back.

497
00:19:48,454 --> 00:19:49,703
What?

498
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:51,266
Nothing. That wasn't flirting.

499
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:53,123
I mean, I know what
flirting looks like.

500
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,775
I didn't say anything.

501
00:19:56,062 --> 00:19:58,279
All right. How we
doing with the harvest?

502
00:19:58,348 --> 00:20:00,380
Oh, slow moving,

503
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:02,494
unlike Dr. Vaughn,
who's super-fast.

504
00:20:02,518 --> 00:20:03,634
Wilson.

505
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:04,830
What're you talking about?

506
00:20:04,854 --> 00:20:05,786
She was flirting with him.

507
00:20:05,855 --> 00:20:07,054
She was not.

508
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:08,656
Oh!

509
00:20:08,725 --> 00:20:11,158
Well, I mean, I
don't see why not.

510
00:20:11,227 --> 00:20:12,938
She doesn't know him
the way we do. Mmm.

511
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:14,856
- What the hell's that mean?
- Oh, you know.

512
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,748
We see you every day.
We're used to all of that.

513
00:20:18,885 --> 00:20:20,296
All right, you two,
I need to focus.

514
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,468
Yes, by all means.

515
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:25,673
Your head CT is fine.

516
00:20:25,742 --> 00:20:28,069
You probably have a mild
concussion. Not a big deal.

517
00:20:28,093 --> 00:20:31,072
But you need to figure out
a way to control your stress.

518
00:20:31,096 --> 00:20:32,730
I know. I've always
been like this.

519
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:34,765
My parents say I'm high-strung.

520
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:36,011
Mmm. Your parents
are on their way?

521
00:20:36,035 --> 00:20:37,434
Yeah, Coach called them.

522
00:20:37,487 --> 00:20:38,869
Lisa, it was an accident!

523
00:20:38,938 --> 00:20:40,637
You never stick the mount.

524
00:20:40,706 --> 00:20:43,524
You trick too early, no matter
how many times we tell you not to.

525
00:20:43,592 --> 00:20:44,753
Edwards, get them to chill.

526
00:20:44,777 --> 00:20:46,377
Guys, it's an emergency room.

527
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:48,340
Can you please save the
yelling for actual emergencies?

528
00:20:48,364 --> 00:20:50,175
So, what, you think
I did it on purpose?

529
00:20:50,199 --> 00:20:52,227
She thinks you're
a liability. Truth.

530
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,462
What's going on?

531
00:20:53,486 --> 00:20:54,596
Lisa's kicking me off the team.

532
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,648
What? Lisa... No,
you can't do that.

533
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:57,983
How about we
don't do any of this?

534
00:20:58,007 --> 00:20:59,201
Do you need me to separate you?

535
00:20:59,225 --> 00:21:01,625
Last I checked, I
was team captain.

536
00:21:01,693 --> 00:21:03,572
Last I checked, you
were a megabitch.

537
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:04,836
Hey! Hey! Enough!

538
00:21:04,881 --> 00:21:06,224
Dani is the best
climber we've got.

539
00:21:06,248 --> 00:21:07,765
Her kicks are incredible.

540
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:09,912
You're just defending her
because she's your bestie

541
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:11,547
and you're basically
attached at the hip, so...

542
00:21:11,571 --> 00:21:12,864
Blake, can you quiet her down?

543
00:21:12,888 --> 00:21:14,383
What do you want
me to do, sedate them?

544
00:21:14,407 --> 00:21:15,967
What does that have
to do with anything?

545
00:21:15,991 --> 00:21:17,369
Guys, be quiet. CHELSEA:
You didn't belong up there.

546
00:21:17,393 --> 00:21:18,454
You're clearly not
pyramid material.

547
00:21:18,478 --> 00:21:19,505
Blake, keep her quiet!

548
00:21:19,529 --> 00:21:21,512
Well, you quiet yours down!

549
00:21:21,581 --> 00:21:23,141
Who says I even want to
cheer with any of you anyway?

550
00:21:23,165 --> 00:21:25,900
Good! Because you're
bringing us all down!

551
00:21:25,968 --> 00:21:27,362
Literally! Everybody shut up!

552
00:21:29,304 --> 00:21:30,515
I don't have a pulse.

553
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:32,066
Is that Maxine? Blake,
charge the paddles to 200.

554
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:33,401
What happened? What's happening?

555
00:21:33,425 --> 00:21:35,070
Is she okay? Maxine?

556
00:21:35,094 --> 00:21:36,171
Is she dying? Oh, my God.

557
00:21:36,195 --> 00:21:37,256
What happened to her?

558
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,340
Guys, look. Is she dead?

559
00:21:38,364 --> 00:21:40,213
Somebody, curtain!

560
00:21:40,282 --> 00:21:42,602
Clear!

561
00:21:46,105 --> 00:21:47,265
How's that hand, Warren?

562
00:21:47,289 --> 00:21:48,634
I'm losing feeling in it.

563
00:21:48,658 --> 00:21:49,968
Worried I'm gonna
let the aorta go.

564
00:21:49,992 --> 00:21:51,186
Okay, well, we'll
get you out of this.

565
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:53,527
Rib spreader, Spencer.
Get a clamp ready.

566
00:21:54,931 --> 00:21:55,931
Okay.

567
00:21:56,665 --> 00:21:58,598
Okay.

568
00:21:58,667 --> 00:22:00,985
Got it. I got it.

569
00:22:01,054 --> 00:22:02,247
Okay. What's his pressure?

570
00:22:02,271 --> 00:22:04,371
Uh, holding steady. 90 systolic.

571
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,185
Of all the stupid,
irresponsible...

572
00:22:06,209 --> 00:22:08,609
I cannot fathom what
possessed you to pull a stunt...

573
00:22:08,695 --> 00:22:10,255
I don't know what else
I should have done.

574
00:22:10,279 --> 00:22:12,040
Hey, you don't want to get me
started on "should" right now.

575
00:22:12,064 --> 00:22:13,175
You should've
called an attending

576
00:22:13,199 --> 00:22:14,243
the second you walked in there.

577
00:22:14,267 --> 00:22:15,377
You should've
known the situation

578
00:22:15,401 --> 00:22:16,933
was nowhere near
under your control.

579
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:18,497
And right now, you
should be thanking God

580
00:22:18,521 --> 00:22:19,798
that I'm here to
clean up your mess.

581
00:22:19,822 --> 00:22:21,262
Yes, sir. I'll do what...

582
00:22:21,307 --> 00:22:22,917
Yeah, you'll do
whatever I damn well say.

583
00:22:22,941 --> 00:22:24,475
Right now, you better be praying

584
00:22:24,543 --> 00:22:27,011
that this man doesn't
die on the table.

585
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:30,497
Maxine, you with
me? Stay with me.

586
00:22:30,566 --> 00:22:32,365
I had a heart attack?

587
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:34,412
How were her electrolytes
before she coded?

588
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:36,170
Good. Within normal limits.

589
00:22:36,238 --> 00:22:38,216
Her heart rate was
over 200 on the monitor.

590
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,507
Did Lisa see it? Did she see me?

591
00:22:40,576 --> 00:22:42,186
Maxine, you did not
have a heart attack.

592
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:44,678
You have a heart
condition, WPW syndrome.

593
00:22:44,746 --> 00:22:46,557
It causes dramatic fluctuations

594
00:22:46,581 --> 00:22:48,093
in your heart
rate. Wait, wait...

595
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:49,578
Normally, I would
treat it with medication,

596
00:22:49,602 --> 00:22:51,529
but your symptoms
are pretty severe,

597
00:22:51,553 --> 00:22:53,515
so I want to take it up to
surgery to correct it right now.

598
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:54,638
No, but my parents...

599
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:56,384
I'm sorry, but we
don't have time

600
00:22:56,408 --> 00:22:58,609
to wait for your parents, okay?

601
00:22:58,677 --> 00:23:01,557
Call upstairs. Prep
for a cardiac ablation.

602
00:23:01,581 --> 00:23:03,179
Will I still be able to cheer?

603
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,833
Lisa already hates me.

604
00:23:06,919 --> 00:23:08,129
If she thinks I'm sick,

605
00:23:08,153 --> 00:23:09,664
she's gonna kick
me off the team, too.

606
00:23:09,688 --> 00:23:12,239
I can't get kicked off.
The team is my life.

607
00:23:12,308 --> 00:23:14,486
Can't you downplay it or
something, keep it a secret?

608
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:16,870
I just... I really don't want
this to go public, you know?

609
00:23:19,281 --> 00:23:20,798
I'll handle them.

610
00:23:20,867 --> 00:23:22,032
Don't worry.

611
00:23:30,076 --> 00:23:32,409
I'll take these DeBakeys.

612
00:23:32,478 --> 00:23:34,489
Dr. Thorpe, are you
ready with the ileal conduit?

613
00:23:34,513 --> 00:23:36,030
Almost there.

614
00:23:36,098 --> 00:23:37,815
Great. Right on time. Good.

615
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:42,736
Damn it.

616
00:23:42,804 --> 00:23:45,088
Look, this bone's friable.

617
00:23:45,157 --> 00:23:47,641
Well, I must say, your
work is impeccable.

618
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:49,554
Oh, yeah? You think so?

619
00:23:49,578 --> 00:23:51,122
Beautiful lembert, Dr. Grey.

620
00:23:51,146 --> 00:23:54,347
Watch out. You almost
sound glad we're here.

621
00:23:55,901 --> 00:23:59,141
Dr. Grey, can you
come with me for a sec?

622
00:23:59,738 --> 00:24:01,215
You want me to step
away from the table?

623
00:24:01,239 --> 00:24:02,239
Mmm-hmm.

624
00:24:02,908 --> 00:24:04,374
I need you on this.

625
00:24:06,762 --> 00:24:08,946
Go ahead. I'm good.

626
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:20,324
Callie, what?

627
00:24:22,778 --> 00:24:24,477
I don't think I can do this.

628
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,687
I can't believe
this is happening.

629
00:24:33,756 --> 00:24:35,489
I can't believe Maxine is dying.

630
00:24:35,558 --> 00:24:37,135
Oh, I didn't say she's dying.

631
00:24:37,159 --> 00:24:39,420
She and I have hung together
forever, since elementary school.

632
00:24:39,444 --> 00:24:40,605
You're such a
good friend to her.

633
00:24:40,629 --> 00:24:42,562
Oh, shut up! This
is all your fault.

634
00:24:42,631 --> 00:24:44,314
You're the reason
she had a heart attack.

635
00:24:44,383 --> 00:24:45,443
It's not a heart attack.

636
00:24:45,467 --> 00:24:47,067
I didn't do anything to her.

637
00:24:47,136 --> 00:24:48,813
How dare you! STEPHANIE: Okay...

638
00:24:48,837 --> 00:24:50,081
You pushed her like you
push all of us. Calm down.

639
00:24:50,105 --> 00:24:51,504
I push because I care!

640
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:53,084
Calm down. And because you suck!

641
00:24:53,108 --> 00:24:54,352
I suck? Your hair sucks! Yeah.

642
00:24:54,376 --> 00:24:55,887
Your face sucks!
My face doesn't suck.

643
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:57,111
Gerber baby. Gerber baby.

644
00:24:57,179 --> 00:24:58,511
All of you sucks!

645
00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:59,413
That's the worst
comeback in the world.

646
00:24:59,481 --> 00:25:00,547
Oh, no, it's not.

647
00:25:03,152 --> 00:25:04,363
God, I hated high school.

648
00:25:04,387 --> 00:25:06,953
Yeah, well, you were,
like, 11 in high school.

649
00:25:08,056 --> 00:25:09,306
Diffuse ST elevations.

650
00:25:09,375 --> 00:25:11,619
Her coronaries are spasming.
We'll need to open them up.

651
00:25:11,643 --> 00:25:13,838
I'll need the ultrasound
and a 5-French sheath.

652
00:25:13,862 --> 00:25:14,973
Prep a drug-eluting stent.

653
00:25:14,997 --> 00:25:16,663
Push 75 of lido
and a bolus of nitro.

654
00:25:16,749 --> 00:25:18,193
- Right away, Doctor.
- Look at this girl.

655
00:25:18,217 --> 00:25:19,927
She's stressing herself
into a heart failure

656
00:25:19,951 --> 00:25:22,111
over whether these
little popularity vultures

657
00:25:22,154 --> 00:25:24,416
will allow her into the
in-crowd like it's life and death.

658
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,701
It's all life and death to them.

659
00:25:25,725 --> 00:25:27,091
Yeah.

660
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:28,637
Thank God we grew out of that.

661
00:25:28,661 --> 00:25:30,794
Yeah. And look at you now.

662
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:33,414
Yeah.

663
00:25:33,482 --> 00:25:34,626
What do you mean,
"Look at me now"?

664
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:35,666
You and DeLuca.

665
00:25:36,168 --> 00:25:37,851
Come on.

666
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:40,065
My point exactly. I work
with teenagers every day.

667
00:25:40,089 --> 00:25:41,800
I know what high
school crap looks like.

668
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:44,969
Multifocal PVCs
from the ischemia.

669
00:25:44,993 --> 00:25:46,605
She's not responding
to the meds.

670
00:25:46,629 --> 00:25:48,590
Pull in the cart and prep the paddles.
- Yes, Doctor.

671
00:25:48,614 --> 00:25:50,541
You're the big quarterback, and
he's the little freshman nerd girl

672
00:25:50,565 --> 00:25:51,859
you're embarrassed to
be seen with in public.

673
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:52,932
What?

674
00:25:53,001 --> 00:25:55,269
That's misogynistic and wrong.

675
00:25:55,337 --> 00:25:57,816
I am the nerd girl. I've
always been the nerd girl.

676
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,851
Not around here. Around
here, you're a prom queen.

677
00:25:59,875 --> 00:26:00,875
You're All-State.

678
00:26:00,942 --> 00:26:02,709
Attendings are
the popular crowd,

679
00:26:02,778 --> 00:26:05,078
and he's a nobody,
and that bugs you.

680
00:26:05,147 --> 00:26:06,575
She's in fib.

681
00:26:06,599 --> 00:26:08,092
All right. Charge to 200.

682
00:26:08,116 --> 00:26:09,399
Charging.

683
00:26:10,386 --> 00:26:11,401
Everybody clear.

684
00:26:13,539 --> 00:26:14,687
Nothing. Again.

685
00:26:16,892 --> 00:26:18,412
All right, we have sinus.

686
00:26:18,928 --> 00:26:20,443
No, this is not high school.

687
00:26:20,512 --> 00:26:21,895
This is life. This is work.

688
00:26:21,963 --> 00:26:24,548
Yeah, exactly, and look around.

689
00:26:24,616 --> 00:26:27,084
I live with a resident.
Torres dates one.

690
00:26:27,153 --> 00:26:30,299
Meredith married an attending.
Nobody cares except you.

691
00:26:30,323 --> 00:26:31,989
Let's get that stent in.

692
00:26:36,145 --> 00:26:37,639
Why are you not in the OR?

693
00:26:37,663 --> 00:26:39,596
Tell him what you told me.

694
00:26:39,665 --> 00:26:41,632
What's going on?

695
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,228
I can't do the reconstruction.

696
00:26:43,252 --> 00:26:44,429
Torres, what the hell?

697
00:26:44,453 --> 00:26:45,693
I had to...

698
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:48,699
I had to resect the wider

699
00:26:48,723 --> 00:26:50,723
margins to get to
healthy bone, okay?

700
00:26:50,792 --> 00:26:52,803
The fibular grafts will be too
small to hold everything in place.

701
00:26:52,827 --> 00:26:54,239
I've got no way to dock the leg.

702
00:26:54,263 --> 00:26:55,828
We don't have a
fallback plan here.

703
00:26:55,897 --> 00:26:57,158
Okay, I need you to hear me.

704
00:26:57,182 --> 00:26:58,893
This is not a matter
of confidence, okay?

705
00:26:58,917 --> 00:27:00,878
It's not me. It is the bone.

706
00:27:00,902 --> 00:27:03,565
I am saying that, with
the pelvis that I have left,

707
00:27:03,589 --> 00:27:04,821
I literally cannot do it.

708
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:06,456
Well, you better do something.

709
00:27:06,525 --> 00:27:08,503
She's right. Look,
if we stop now,

710
00:27:08,527 --> 00:27:10,288
we're leaving him worse
off than when we got him.

711
00:27:10,312 --> 00:27:11,456
He's not gonna
survive the night.

712
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,924
Okay. Stop. Stop it. Okay?

713
00:27:12,948 --> 00:27:14,992
You guys aren't telling me
anything I don't already know.

714
00:27:15,016 --> 00:27:18,185
Just... I need a minute. I
need some space to think.

715
00:27:18,253 --> 00:27:21,666
Okay? Just... You all go
back in there and irrigate.

716
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:23,534
I don't know. Just buy
me some time, okay?

717
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:26,404
Okay, you heard her. Let's
just give her some space.

718
00:27:26,428 --> 00:27:28,868
I will think of something.

719
00:27:34,887 --> 00:27:36,119
Come on.

720
00:27:39,224 --> 00:27:40,306
Damn it!

721
00:27:50,101 --> 00:27:51,651
She's coming back, right?

722
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,153
She's coming back.

723
00:27:53,222 --> 00:27:54,999
Good. Because he's
been under for a long time.

724
00:27:55,023 --> 00:27:57,152
Listen, I know you've
had your reservations,

725
00:27:57,176 --> 00:27:58,524
but when we're done...

726
00:27:58,594 --> 00:28:00,760
I still have my reservations.

727
00:28:00,829 --> 00:28:02,979
I've known Carson ever
since the Medical Corps.

728
00:28:03,049 --> 00:28:04,809
He's a one-night stand for you.

729
00:28:05,851 --> 00:28:06,883
I'm sorry?

730
00:28:06,952 --> 00:28:08,251
Look, you fly in,

731
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,620
do a flashy surgery
that'll make all the journals,

732
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:12,105
and you're gone in the morning.

733
00:28:12,174 --> 00:28:15,220
And I'm still here to help him
make sense of what you did.

734
00:28:15,244 --> 00:28:18,195
You're leaving him with one
leg in the middle of his body.

735
00:28:18,264 --> 00:28:20,046
You say he'll walk again? How?

736
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:21,648
How's that even gonna work?

737
00:28:21,716 --> 00:28:23,350
Not to mention how
you're compromising

738
00:28:23,418 --> 00:28:24,718
his gastrointestinal system,

739
00:28:24,787 --> 00:28:26,369
his nervous system.

740
00:28:26,438 --> 00:28:28,082
He thinks you're
giving him his life back,

741
00:28:28,106 --> 00:28:29,785
but what's that life
gonna look like?

742
00:28:29,809 --> 00:28:32,209
We'll follow up.
Of course we will.

743
00:28:32,277 --> 00:28:34,437
Dr. Torres will be available.

744
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:39,833
Will she? When's that?

745
00:28:42,671 --> 00:28:43,914
You didn't get
through to them at all?

746
00:28:43,938 --> 00:28:46,717
Whatever. I hope
they eat each other.

747
00:28:46,741 --> 00:28:48,508
Look. He's down
there, all right.

748
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:50,877
DeLuca. Is it true?

749
00:28:50,946 --> 00:28:52,274
Warren cut a guy
open with a clipboard?

750
00:28:52,298 --> 00:28:54,080
It is.

751
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:55,226
I feel like I'd get in trouble

752
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:57,083
for something like that. Yeah.

753
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:59,536
And he gets a surgery out of it.

754
00:28:59,605 --> 00:29:01,716
It must be nice being
married to the chief.

755
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,206
Look at Wilson.

756
00:29:03,275 --> 00:29:06,237
All she has to do is
sleep with Grey's BFF.

757
00:29:06,261 --> 00:29:07,823
Of course she gets
the wonder surgery.

758
00:29:07,847 --> 00:29:09,747
Come on. You're...

759
00:29:09,815 --> 00:29:11,297
I mean, you're
seeing Torres, right?

760
00:29:11,366 --> 00:29:12,844
Callie doesn't give me anything.

761
00:29:12,868 --> 00:29:14,646
Besides, she was dating Torres

762
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:16,648
before she even
started working here.

763
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:18,216
She's not nailing an
attending to get ahead.

764
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,868
I don't think that's
what's going on here.

765
00:29:19,892 --> 00:29:22,459
Really? Warren's
married to the chief,

766
00:29:22,527 --> 00:29:24,139
so he's scrubbed in
down there on a surgery

767
00:29:24,163 --> 00:29:25,473
while we're stuck
watching up here.

768
00:29:25,497 --> 00:29:26,607
You don't think
the two are related?

769
00:29:26,631 --> 00:29:27,931
I know they are.

770
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,711
It's unfair. Uncool.

771
00:29:29,735 --> 00:29:31,568
Lame. So lame.

772
00:29:33,305 --> 00:29:35,005
Oh, dear God.

773
00:29:35,074 --> 00:29:36,206
We sound just like...

774
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:38,809
Yeah, we do.

775
00:29:38,877 --> 00:29:40,655
But we're not like those girls.

776
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:41,962
Well, I'm not.

777
00:29:42,664 --> 00:29:43,904
Oh.

778
00:29:44,833 --> 00:29:46,983
Excuse me?

779
00:29:47,052 --> 00:29:49,569
I was never like
one of those girls.

780
00:29:49,638 --> 00:29:51,204
I never fit in the usual molds,

781
00:29:51,273 --> 00:29:54,340
I always did my own thing,
I never wore a hair bow,

782
00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:56,510
and I never worried about it.

783
00:29:56,578 --> 00:29:58,345
And you think I did?

784
00:29:58,414 --> 00:30:00,008
You said yourself
you were one of them.

785
00:30:00,032 --> 00:30:02,516
Like "boss lady" one of them.

786
00:30:02,584 --> 00:30:03,744
Hmm.

787
00:30:04,453 --> 00:30:06,085
You're right.

788
00:30:07,673 --> 00:30:08,872
I was.

789
00:30:12,962 --> 00:30:14,202
Where are you going?

790
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:17,942
Good blood flow to the kidneys.

791
00:30:17,966 --> 00:30:19,666
You know what this
means, Dr. Spencer?

792
00:30:19,735 --> 00:30:22,052
That the patient's
gonna survive, sir?

793
00:30:22,121 --> 00:30:23,448
Well, it means that Dr. Warren

794
00:30:23,472 --> 00:30:24,971
will only be facing suspension

795
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,923
instead of
criminal-assault charges.

796
00:30:26,992 --> 00:30:28,436
Sir, I understand
you're upset...

797
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:31,010
The time for pulling
boneheaded stunts is long past...

798
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:32,379
"Boneheaded"?

799
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:34,642
What about saving a
man's life is boneheaded?

800
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:35,899
Warren...

801
00:30:35,968 --> 00:30:37,112
Look, sir, I may be a resident,

802
00:30:37,136 --> 00:30:39,469
but I have been a
doctor a lot longer.

803
00:30:39,538 --> 00:30:40,782
The other residents
love to give me crap

804
00:30:40,806 --> 00:30:42,217
about how much
older than them I am,

805
00:30:42,241 --> 00:30:45,074
but at the end of the
day, I'm also wiser, too.

806
00:30:45,143 --> 00:30:48,063
All right, this wasn't a stunt.
This was a judgment call.

807
00:30:48,113 --> 00:30:50,947
I took a risk, it paid off,
and this man is alive.

808
00:30:50,999 --> 00:30:52,576
Now, I understand,
I broke the rules,

809
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,768
and I need to pay
the price for that, but...

810
00:30:55,837 --> 00:30:57,254
I'm not an idiot.

811
00:30:57,322 --> 00:30:59,734
And I don't deserve to be
spoken to as though I am.

812
00:30:59,758 --> 00:31:02,693
No, what you deserve
is a hell of a lot worse.

813
00:31:02,761 --> 00:31:06,196
What you call a calculated
risk is what I call foolish.

814
00:31:06,264 --> 00:31:08,281
Don't confuse the two, Warren.

815
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:09,950
You did not show skill today.

816
00:31:10,019 --> 00:31:12,936
You showed bravado,
and that is dangerous.

817
00:31:13,589 --> 00:31:14,821
Suction.

818
00:31:19,161 --> 00:31:20,610
Callie.

819
00:31:20,679 --> 00:31:22,691
No, get back in
there. It's fine, it's fine.

820
00:31:22,715 --> 00:31:24,843
I'm... I'm... I'm thinking.
Okay, I just need to think.

821
00:31:24,867 --> 00:31:26,667
You want space? Yes!

822
00:31:26,735 --> 00:31:28,468
I get it.

823
00:31:28,537 --> 00:31:29,847
I keep asking for space.

824
00:31:29,871 --> 00:31:31,549
People keep not giving it to me,

825
00:31:31,573 --> 00:31:34,018
bugging me about hot
doctors asking for my number.

826
00:31:34,042 --> 00:31:35,553
And I keep shutting
them down because...

827
00:31:35,577 --> 00:31:37,127
Why? Why are we
talking about this?

828
00:31:37,196 --> 00:31:40,680
Because it's not always the
worst thing when people push you.

829
00:31:40,749 --> 00:31:43,527
When people push you,
they're trying to help you.

830
00:31:43,551 --> 00:31:46,097
I'm trying to help you.
Let's figure this out, please.

831
00:31:46,121 --> 00:31:47,888
You can't. It's my specialty.

832
00:31:47,956 --> 00:31:50,256
It's on me. And I am trying.

833
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:52,309
I just... I don't
know how to make...

834
00:31:52,378 --> 00:31:54,222
So if we had
another practice run

835
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:56,925
and we were in the cadaver lab
and you had all the time in the world,

836
00:31:56,949 --> 00:31:57,992
where would you start?

837
00:31:58,016 --> 00:31:59,149
We don't have time!

838
00:31:59,217 --> 00:32:00,361
That's the problem.

839
00:32:00,385 --> 00:32:02,096
Okay. So what's the
first thing you would do?

840
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,519
I don't know!

841
00:32:03,589 --> 00:32:06,309
Yes, you do. I know you do.

842
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,760
I would

843
00:32:10,829 --> 00:32:13,647
review the biomechanics,
and then I would...

844
00:32:14,767 --> 00:32:16,132
Recalculate the angles.

845
00:32:16,201 --> 00:32:17,651
Okay. And then?

846
00:32:29,981 --> 00:32:33,350
Okay, ladies! Okay, ladies!

847
00:32:33,419 --> 00:32:35,618
Hi!

848
00:32:35,687 --> 00:32:39,171
Here's how this is gonna
go. Your teammate is down.

849
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:42,008
She needs you. She
needs your support.

850
00:32:42,076 --> 00:32:45,195
You're her spotters. All of you.

851
00:32:45,264 --> 00:32:46,596
'Cause you're her team,

852
00:32:46,665 --> 00:32:49,599
and it's time you
started acting like one.

853
00:32:49,668 --> 00:32:52,151
If you want to
talk medicine, fine.

854
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,987
But, sorry,

855
00:32:54,056 --> 00:32:57,757
you have no clue
about our team, okay?

856
00:32:57,826 --> 00:32:59,543
So...

857
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:03,090
I mean, who the hell does
she think she is anyway?

858
00:33:03,114 --> 00:33:04,648
Cheer captain.

859
00:33:04,717 --> 00:33:06,916
Promoted as a sophomore
for a triple-year reign

860
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:08,179
because I was just that good.

861
00:33:08,203 --> 00:33:10,821
Led my team to
victory after victory.

862
00:33:10,889 --> 00:33:13,390
Regionals, Nationals,
Internationals.

863
00:33:13,458 --> 00:33:16,059
Three years in a row. Yeah.

864
00:33:16,678 --> 00:33:17,888
That's amazing.

865
00:33:17,912 --> 00:33:19,846
So let me break
this down for you.

866
00:33:19,915 --> 00:33:21,815
You are jealous of her

867
00:33:21,883 --> 00:33:23,616
because she and
Maxine are close now,

868
00:33:23,685 --> 00:33:26,353
so you got all butthurt,

869
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:28,282
but they aren't actually
trying to leave you out.

870
00:33:28,306 --> 00:33:29,840
Are you? Danielle.

871
00:33:29,908 --> 00:33:31,541
Uh... No, ma'am.

872
00:33:31,593 --> 00:33:32,792
Good.

873
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:35,745
You see, Lisa?

874
00:33:35,814 --> 00:33:37,775
It's time for you to lose
that chip on your shoulder.

875
00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:39,165
It's a Double Full Basket Toss.

876
00:33:39,234 --> 00:33:40,800
Throw it up, move on.

877
00:33:40,868 --> 00:33:42,188
You've got cheerleading to do.

878
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:47,240
She told you she'd be in soon?

879
00:33:47,309 --> 00:33:48,875
Yes.

880
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:51,444
BP's dropping.

881
00:33:51,513 --> 00:33:52,657
Hang a dopamine drip.

882
00:33:52,681 --> 00:33:53,808
Hey, what, is she on the phone?

883
00:33:53,832 --> 00:33:55,026
Why don't you give her a minute?

884
00:33:55,050 --> 00:33:56,544
We don't have anymore minutes.

885
00:33:56,568 --> 00:33:58,445
His BP is dropping,
and he's fluid overloaded.

886
00:33:58,469 --> 00:34:01,187
I think we have a
couple more minutes.

887
00:34:01,255 --> 00:34:02,533
You know what I think?

888
00:34:02,557 --> 00:34:04,419
You people don't
know what you're doing.

889
00:34:04,443 --> 00:34:06,059
You didn't have the plan.

890
00:34:06,128 --> 00:34:08,778
You weren't ready to move,
and you moved anyway.

891
00:34:08,847 --> 00:34:11,275
And I think you knew that when
you came through that door.

892
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:13,483
And I think he's gonna
suffer as a result of it.

893
00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:18,270
Listen, here's the thing...

894
00:34:18,339 --> 00:34:19,484
I'm gonna do a back flip!

895
00:34:19,508 --> 00:34:21,318
- What the hell...
- For the sacrum!

896
00:34:21,342 --> 00:34:23,204
I cut off the proximal
end of the femur,

897
00:34:23,228 --> 00:34:25,155
I flip it around backwards,
and I make it into a sacrum.

898
00:34:25,179 --> 00:34:26,729
Can you do that?

899
00:34:26,798 --> 00:34:28,976
Mayo's done it a
few times. We'll see.

900
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,182
Hell, yes, I can do it!

901
00:34:30,251 --> 00:34:32,291
Avery, let's go see
a leg about a femur.

902
00:34:35,089 --> 00:34:36,329
We have a plan.

903
00:34:37,526 --> 00:34:38,766
We're the Dream Team.

904
00:35:57,606 --> 00:35:58,905
Damn.

905
00:35:58,974 --> 00:36:01,041
Told you.

906
00:36:02,277 --> 00:36:03,326
It's a miracle.

907
00:36:11,186 --> 00:36:12,763
Whew. We almost
just killed that guy.

908
00:36:12,787 --> 00:36:14,232
Oh, my God. Right?

909
00:36:14,256 --> 00:36:15,496
Skin of our teeth.

910
00:36:15,523 --> 00:36:17,023
Thank you, Jesus.

911
00:36:17,092 --> 00:36:19,025
Oh, my phone's been blowing up.

912
00:36:20,295 --> 00:36:21,928
I got to go, now.

913
00:36:22,330 --> 00:36:23,410
Oh!

914
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:33,756
So, the good news is,
the surgery went very well.

915
00:36:33,825 --> 00:36:36,008
Hey, Edwards, what do
you think you're doing?

916
00:36:36,077 --> 00:36:37,955
They can't be up here. You
want to wake up the whole floor?

917
00:36:37,979 --> 00:36:39,757
It's not gonna be a
problem, Dr. Karev.

918
00:36:39,781 --> 00:36:41,525
These ladies aren't
gonna make a sound.

919
00:36:41,549 --> 00:36:42,549
Are we, ladies?

920
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:44,361
No, ma'am. No.

921
00:36:44,385 --> 00:36:46,664
We'd just like to see Maxine.

922
00:36:46,688 --> 00:36:48,170
Would that be okay?

923
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,472
Uh...

924
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:50,990
Yeah. Okay.

925
00:36:55,597 --> 00:36:57,642
I'm gonna need you to
show me how you did that.

926
00:36:57,666 --> 00:36:59,060
Just a matter of leadership.

927
00:36:59,084 --> 00:37:00,183
Yeah, but, no, really.

928
00:37:05,606 --> 00:37:07,484
I want updates every hour.

929
00:37:07,508 --> 00:37:10,009
If that man's hemoglobin
drops so much as a point,

930
00:37:10,078 --> 00:37:11,510
I want to be paged.

931
00:37:11,579 --> 00:37:12,924
Well, a single point isn't
exactly cause for you to...

932
00:37:12,948 --> 00:37:15,381
You don't have
autonomy here, Warren.

933
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:17,233
I make the calls
from here on out.

934
00:37:17,302 --> 00:37:19,382
Understand? Understood, sir.

935
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:22,622
Uh, someone want to
tell me why I received

936
00:37:22,691 --> 00:37:24,724
not one, but two,
separate phone calls

937
00:37:24,792 --> 00:37:26,025
from two separate attendings

938
00:37:26,094 --> 00:37:28,811
telling me my husband
had lost his mind?

939
00:37:31,333 --> 00:37:32,643
Look, it was a
unique situation...

940
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:35,101
I got an earful on
how unique it was.

941
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:36,936
I'm clear on the situation.

942
00:37:37,005 --> 00:37:38,304
Excuse us, please.

943
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:42,999
Miranda, listen, I...

944
00:37:44,946 --> 00:37:46,045
Okay.

945
00:37:46,114 --> 00:37:47,925
Chief, I know you're angry...

946
00:37:47,949 --> 00:37:50,616
I am angry that
I have a resident

947
00:37:50,686 --> 00:37:53,820
who ignored every single
protocol he's been taught.

948
00:37:53,889 --> 00:37:56,690
I'm disappointed by
the ego and arrogance

949
00:37:56,758 --> 00:37:58,235
that this resident
has displayed.

950
00:37:58,259 --> 00:38:01,127
And I'm embarrassed
that the resident in question

951
00:38:01,196 --> 00:38:03,313
happens to be my husband!

952
00:38:03,381 --> 00:38:05,014
Wow. Okay.

953
00:38:05,082 --> 00:38:07,433
Oh, come on! You know
better than this, Ben Warren.

954
00:38:07,502 --> 00:38:09,468
You are better than this.

955
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:13,223
Now I got... I got to set up
sit-downs with both attendings,

956
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:15,191
and I have to discipline you!

957
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:17,521
You're making an already
difficult night that much harder.

958
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:20,090
Well, I'm sorry I had to add
to your workload, Miranda,

959
00:38:20,114 --> 00:38:21,459
but I was trying to save a life.

960
00:38:21,483 --> 00:38:22,543
The man was dying.

961
00:38:22,567 --> 00:38:23,917
And how is he now?

962
00:38:23,985 --> 00:38:26,352
Alive. Stable. I
got to him in time.

963
00:38:26,421 --> 00:38:29,189
No, you got lucky.

964
00:38:29,257 --> 00:38:32,125
If you'd been left with a
dead man on that table

965
00:38:32,194 --> 00:38:34,127
after you did what you did...

966
00:38:36,464 --> 00:38:37,514
What?

967
00:38:37,582 --> 00:38:41,217
Well...

968
00:38:41,285 --> 00:38:43,685
I wouldn't be letting you off
with just a 3-day suspension.

969
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:45,983
You're suspending me?

970
00:38:46,007 --> 00:38:49,375
You're... You're
damn right I am!

971
00:38:49,443 --> 00:38:52,245
Because no... No
special treatment!

972
00:38:52,313 --> 00:38:53,579
Come on!

973
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:58,651
That said, you opened
up a man's chest

974
00:38:58,719 --> 00:39:00,620
with your bare hands
and a clipboard.

975
00:39:07,929 --> 00:39:09,373
Yeah, you got to walk
me through this one.

976
00:39:09,397 --> 00:39:10,763
I want to hear every detail.

977
00:39:19,241 --> 00:39:21,040
Hey.

978
00:39:21,109 --> 00:39:25,278
Are you still... Yeah,
still here. All night.

979
00:39:25,346 --> 00:39:27,191
We have that VATS this morning.

980
00:39:27,215 --> 00:39:28,592
We can push it to
tonight if you need sleep.

981
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:30,533
Yes. That would be great.

982
00:39:30,602 --> 00:39:33,253
Yeah, what time
were you thinking?

983
00:39:33,321 --> 00:39:34,382
Actually... Very good.

984
00:39:34,406 --> 00:39:35,421
Dr. DeLuca?

985
00:39:35,490 --> 00:39:37,273
All right.

986
00:39:37,341 --> 00:39:38,781
Can you come here
a minute, please?

987
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:42,295
Um... Dr. Riggs?

988
00:39:42,363 --> 00:39:46,232
I'm sorry. I cannot join
you on that case tonight

989
00:39:46,301 --> 00:39:48,551
because I have plans

990
00:39:49,687 --> 00:39:51,287
with Dr. DeLuca.

991
00:39:52,924 --> 00:39:54,473
A date. Okay.

992
00:39:54,542 --> 00:39:56,809
Whom I've been seeing.
We've been seeing each other.

993
00:39:56,878 --> 00:40:00,863
As a couple,
romantically... In romance.

994
00:40:00,932 --> 00:40:04,092
So you want to keep the
surgery this morning, then?

995
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:06,168
Yes, that would be fine.

996
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:07,403
Okay.

997
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:10,823
All right. I'll see
you in there.

998
00:40:12,693 --> 00:40:14,422
That was hard to watch.

999
00:40:14,446 --> 00:40:15,712
Shut up.

1000
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:16,780
It was hard to do.

1001
00:40:18,683 --> 00:40:22,043
It was really hard
to watch, though.

1002
00:40:23,104 --> 00:40:24,637
So, I... I did it.

1003
00:40:27,659 --> 00:40:29,191
Right? Yeah.

1004
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,094
No, you did it.

1005
00:40:31,162 --> 00:40:34,230
<i>There's a reason we like
to keep things to ourselves.</i>

1006
00:40:34,299 --> 00:40:36,699
Well, I was wrong.
I can admit that.

1007
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:39,446
It's great what you did in
there. I'm just glad I saw it.

1008
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:41,532
Well, it was nice
working with you.

1009
00:40:41,556 --> 00:40:43,989
See? You fly in, you fly out.

1010
00:40:44,058 --> 00:40:46,742
Well, we said we'll
follow up, and we will.

1011
00:40:46,811 --> 00:40:48,294
<i>When you have an audience,</i>

1012
00:40:48,363 --> 00:40:51,146
<i>even the smallest moments
end up feeling huge.</i>

1013
00:40:51,215 --> 00:40:53,816
Well, I'd like that...
To follow up with you.

1014
00:40:53,885 --> 00:40:55,295
<i>It makes the really big moments</i>

1015
00:40:55,319 --> 00:40:57,736
<i>seem positively
earth-shattering.</i>

1016
00:40:57,805 --> 00:41:00,406
Okay. So, here is my service,

1017
00:41:00,474 --> 00:41:02,775
and the hospital
number's on there, as well,

1018
00:41:02,861 --> 00:41:04,621
if you want to
follow up with Torres.

1019
00:41:04,645 --> 00:41:06,162
Great. I'll... I'll do that.

1020
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:07,964
Let's go. Take care.

1021
00:41:08,032 --> 00:41:09,432
Thank you.

1022
00:41:09,501 --> 00:41:11,078
Yep, that guy definitely
just asked for your number.

1023
00:41:11,102 --> 00:41:12,480
Like, asked for your number.

1024
00:41:12,504 --> 00:41:14,024
Yeah, to follow up
about the patient.

1025
00:41:14,072 --> 00:41:16,250
No. I know when
someone's flirting.

1026
00:41:16,274 --> 00:41:17,885
Okay? That's what
flirting looks like.

1027
00:41:17,909 --> 00:41:19,854
<i>The trick is not
letting the pressure</i>

1028
00:41:19,878 --> 00:41:21,718
<i>keep you from
taking big chances.</i>

1029
00:41:21,746 --> 00:41:24,180
Meredith, let's go. What,
did you forget something?

1030
00:41:24,249 --> 00:41:25,431
<i>You just go out there...</i>

1031
00:41:26,384 --> 00:41:28,084
Oh! Come on!

1032
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:30,086
<i>Naked and afraid...</i>

1033
00:41:39,314 --> 00:41:41,847
All right.

1034
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,580
Ahem.

1035
00:41:57,649 --> 00:41:59,729
Shut up. It was
nothing. Mmm-hmm.

1036
00:42:04,238 --> 00:42:06,506
<i>And pretend no one's looking.</i>
