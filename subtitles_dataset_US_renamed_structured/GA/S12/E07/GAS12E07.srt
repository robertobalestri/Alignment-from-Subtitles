1
00:00:04,771 --> 00:00:07,672
<i>Every surgeon is trained
to look for problems.</i>

2
00:00:07,741 --> 00:00:10,309
<i>To look at a person and
say, "What's wrong with you?"</i>

3
00:00:10,378 --> 00:00:12,498
Where am I supposed to be now?

4
00:00:12,546 --> 00:00:14,013
You can come with me.

5
00:00:14,081 --> 00:00:15,580
Cross.

6
00:00:15,649 --> 00:00:17,582
Drunk or deranged.
Find out which.

7
00:00:18,936 --> 00:00:20,318
Sir. Hi.

8
00:00:20,387 --> 00:00:21,453
Uh, can I help you?

9
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:24,038
I don't know.

10
00:00:24,108 --> 00:00:25,957
You guys called me.

11
00:00:28,462 --> 00:00:31,408
<i>We're trained to foresee
the ugliest possible outcome.</i>

12
00:00:31,432 --> 00:00:33,164
She actually said...

13
00:00:33,233 --> 00:00:36,902
Steph said I'm not as
good a surgeon as she is.

14
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:39,104
Is that true? Of course not.

15
00:00:39,156 --> 00:00:41,000
Yeah, but is that
the perception?

16
00:00:41,024 --> 00:00:43,086
Do attendings just automatically
go to anyone but me?

17
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:44,526
I think you're amazing.

18
00:00:52,186 --> 00:00:53,352
Oh, my God.

19
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,403
Oh, my God! Mr. Jaffee!

20
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:57,484
<i>When your job is to
make people better,</i>

21
00:00:57,508 --> 00:00:59,452
<i>you're automatically inclined</i>

22
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:01,116
<i>to look for the worst in them.</i>

23
00:01:02,363 --> 00:01:04,630
Wilson, I have three kids.

24
00:01:04,698 --> 00:01:05,698
Three.

25
00:01:05,766 --> 00:01:08,126
Do you have any idea
how little sleep I get?

26
00:01:10,137 --> 00:01:12,186
Mr. Jaffee?

27
00:01:12,255 --> 00:01:15,295
Are you sure you
don't want to just sleep?

28
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:17,208
You cannot keep this up.

29
00:01:17,277 --> 00:01:18,410
Grey is killing you.

30
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,713
I know, but I can't
think of that right now.

31
00:01:21,782 --> 00:01:23,598
'Cause right now, I'm in a bed.

32
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:26,651
A comfy, comfy bed...

33
00:01:27,855 --> 00:01:29,170
With you.

34
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:35,755
Did you just fall asleep?

35
00:01:35,779 --> 00:01:37,779
Got it!

36
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:38,964
Wha...

37
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,232
Hello? Uh-huh.

38
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:43,769
Of course it is.

39
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:45,370
Yeah. Of course it is.

40
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,871
This is ridiculous.

41
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,335
No, absolutely.
Absolutely I can.

42
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:50,975
Uh-huh. No, of course.

43
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:52,861
Who's Mr. Jaffee?

44
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:55,096
Simon Jaffee.
End-stage renal disease.

45
00:01:55,165 --> 00:01:57,332
He's been on dialysis
for the last 18 months

46
00:01:57,401 --> 00:01:58,745
waiting for a transplant donor.

47
00:01:58,769 --> 00:01:59,868
Why so long?

48
00:01:59,937 --> 00:02:02,181
Antibodies. He needs
a six-antigen match...

49
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:04,372
An impossible
match until tonight.

50
00:02:04,441 --> 00:02:05,757
We've been looking forever.

51
00:02:05,826 --> 00:02:07,486
It's like finding
the Holy Grail.

52
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:09,911
Blake, when was Mr. Jaffee's
last round of dialysis?

53
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:11,646
Oh, um, looking...

54
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:13,893
He was at the dialysis
center two days ago.

55
00:02:13,917 --> 00:02:17,452
Electrolytes and renal labs
were within expected limits, so...

56
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,316
I've been on his case
since I was an intern.

57
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,723
I'm so sorry, Dr. Grey.
I will catch up.

58
00:02:21,792 --> 00:02:23,553
It's okay, Blake.
Do the best you can,

59
00:02:23,577 --> 00:02:27,177
and ask Wilson if you
have any questions.

60
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:29,492
There are my girls.

61
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:31,260
Mr. Jaffee, it's so
good to see you.

62
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:32,479
Where are the grandkids?

63
00:02:32,503 --> 00:02:34,513
I haven't even called them yet.

64
00:02:34,537 --> 00:02:37,990
I wanted to wait until I
knew it was a sure thing.

65
00:02:38,058 --> 00:02:39,424
So...

66
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:40,976
Is it true?

67
00:02:41,044 --> 00:02:44,044
It's true. We
found you a kidney.

68
00:02:50,604 --> 00:02:52,081
Thanks again for breakfast.

69
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:54,739
My pleasure.

70
00:02:54,808 --> 00:02:57,543
This was his last
night in my house.

71
00:02:57,611 --> 00:02:59,322
You just made the man pancakes.

72
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:01,791
Because I am a benevolent
leader and good host.

73
00:03:01,815 --> 00:03:03,760
And I've been waiting for
this thing to resolve itself.

74
00:03:03,784 --> 00:03:05,016
It has not.

75
00:03:05,702 --> 00:03:07,168
This job is stressful.

76
00:03:07,237 --> 00:03:09,382
I need to go home at night
and be alone with my husband.

77
00:03:09,406 --> 00:03:11,701
Well, I agree with
that, but... Whoa!

78
00:03:11,725 --> 00:03:14,504
Miranda, he's my friend,
all right? And he's my boss.

79
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:16,327
I'm your boss,
too. And his boss.

80
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:17,762
I'm all your bosses.

81
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:20,548
If you want your wife back,
take care of your business...

82
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:21,749
Today.

83
00:03:23,287 --> 00:03:24,881
So, I'm just wondering if
maybe we should rethink

84
00:03:24,905 --> 00:03:26,771
the resident-rotation system.

85
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,018
I mean, make sure
that our residents

86
00:03:28,042 --> 00:03:30,708
get an equal opportunity
on every specialty.

87
00:03:30,777 --> 00:03:32,017
Isn't that happening?

88
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:33,645
Well, there's a danger

89
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:35,325
that our residents are being
monopolized by a single attending.

90
00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:37,276
She's talking about
Blake. You know what?

91
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,578
This is not your busi...
Isn't Blake with Grey?

92
00:03:38,602 --> 00:03:40,352
Yes, and she has
been since she got here.

93
00:03:40,421 --> 00:03:42,287
I worry she's not
getting a full education.

94
00:03:42,356 --> 00:03:43,922
And Grey is...

95
00:03:45,025 --> 00:03:47,475
She's running her ragged.

96
00:03:47,544 --> 00:03:49,294
Residency runs you ragged.

97
00:03:49,363 --> 00:03:51,257
We've all been there, Torres.
You know this as well as anyone.

98
00:03:51,281 --> 00:03:52,759
No, but this is different.
This is different.

99
00:03:52,783 --> 00:03:54,516
I think it's personal.

100
00:03:54,584 --> 00:03:56,830
Is it that you want to spend
more time with your girlfriend?

101
00:03:56,854 --> 00:03:58,536
Amelia, could you please...

102
00:03:58,606 --> 00:04:00,316
I mean, you are
saying that it's personal.

103
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,940
Hey, hey. All right. All right.

104
00:04:03,226 --> 00:04:06,644
Has Blake expressed
this concern or just you?

105
00:04:07,448 --> 00:04:08,525
Okay. She's...

106
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:10,026
Blake stays with Grey.

107
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:12,195
We don't have a policy
to move around residents

108
00:04:12,219 --> 00:04:13,596
to accommodate
your personal lives.

109
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:14,847
No, that's not
what I was saying.

110
00:04:14,871 --> 00:04:16,666
If Blake has a problem,
she comes to me.

111
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,658
All right. He has
already been seen.

112
00:04:24,682 --> 00:04:26,014
I know the doctor is...

113
00:04:26,684 --> 00:04:27,982
Hey, all.

114
00:04:28,051 --> 00:04:29,762
I was just wondering if
someone could tell me

115
00:04:29,786 --> 00:04:32,203
where I can get some scrubs.

116
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:35,139
Uh, third floor by
the dispensary.

117
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:36,657
Cheers.

118
00:04:36,727 --> 00:04:39,094
You're Dr. Pierce,
right? Mmm-hmm.

119
00:04:39,162 --> 00:04:42,079
Yeah, I just wanted to
say I'm super excited,

120
00:04:42,148 --> 00:04:43,899
and I can't wait to get started.

121
00:04:45,101 --> 00:04:46,101
Great.

122
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:50,622
Go get 'em.

123
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:55,927
Okey-dokey.

124
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:58,330
Yep.

125
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,316
Who was that?

126
00:05:17,101 --> 00:05:18,299
Oh.

127
00:05:18,368 --> 00:05:19,368
Oh, hey.

128
00:05:19,436 --> 00:05:20,436
I found you.

129
00:05:20,503 --> 00:05:22,003
Pulled a night shift.

130
00:05:22,873 --> 00:05:25,640
This is a nice way to wake up.

131
00:05:25,709 --> 00:05:27,549
I could get used to this.

132
00:05:29,045 --> 00:05:30,244
How's your day?

133
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:35,149
I had to listen to Torres go
on and on about her girlfriend,

134
00:05:37,721 --> 00:05:41,055
who Meredith's got basically
chained to her service.

135
00:05:41,124 --> 00:05:42,908
I don't know how
she even looks at her.

136
00:05:48,615 --> 00:05:51,082
Mmm. I'm sorry. You were saying?

137
00:05:52,652 --> 00:05:53,801
Was I?

138
00:06:07,568 --> 00:06:09,278
Gary, this is Dr. Karev.

139
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:10,569
Uh, Gary Walton, 14.

140
00:06:10,637 --> 00:06:12,098
Complaining of abdominal pain.

141
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:13,166
How's it going, Gary?

142
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:14,589
This ball looks like a cherry.

143
00:06:14,658 --> 00:06:16,074
Do you like cherries?

144
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:18,493
Gary was born with some
intellectual disabilities.

145
00:06:18,579 --> 00:06:20,356
Well, I'm more of
an apple guy myself.

146
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,807
But, uh, do you like cherries?

147
00:06:21,831 --> 00:06:23,415
I love cherries.

148
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:25,044
Loves these stupid things. And
that's probably why he ate one.

149
00:06:25,068 --> 00:06:26,868
Joel!

150
00:06:26,936 --> 00:06:29,538
He did, actually. He
swallowed the other one.

151
00:06:29,606 --> 00:06:30,639
Is he gonna be okay?

152
00:06:30,707 --> 00:06:32,318
Here it is on the X-ray.

153
00:06:32,342 --> 00:06:33,603
I can show you where it is.

154
00:06:33,627 --> 00:06:37,067
Gary, you want to show
Dr. Karev what you showed me?

155
00:06:38,514 --> 00:06:40,754
Gary. What'd you do that for?

156
00:06:40,783 --> 00:06:41,995
It looked like a cherry.

157
00:06:42,019 --> 00:06:44,080
Well, I bet it didn't
taste like one.

158
00:06:44,104 --> 00:06:45,597
It's in my tummy now.

159
00:06:45,621 --> 00:06:47,288
This doctor says
he needs surgery.

160
00:06:47,357 --> 00:06:49,786
Endoscopic surgery just
to remove the ball, right?

161
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:51,754
Whoa, whoa, whoa. I think
Dr. Spencer jumped the gun a little.

162
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:54,007
Gary's body has
its own exit strategy.

163
00:06:54,031 --> 00:06:55,558
Gary, you're gonna poop it.

164
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:57,582
Oh, ho, ho! That
is going to hurt.

165
00:06:57,651 --> 00:06:58,916
Joel!

166
00:06:58,985 --> 00:07:01,469
Well, maybe it'll keep him
from doing crap like this.

167
00:07:01,538 --> 00:07:03,182
Well, so don't
worry. No surgery.

168
00:07:03,206 --> 00:07:06,007
Oh, good. Thank you.

169
00:07:06,076 --> 00:07:08,559
Uh, we'll just keep
him here overnight,

170
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:10,322
and, uh, we'll make sure
everything comes out okay.

171
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:11,897
Gary, want to sleep over?

172
00:07:11,965 --> 00:07:12,965
Yeah!

173
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:14,349
Okay.

174
00:07:14,418 --> 00:07:15,418
Can I stay with him?

175
00:07:15,485 --> 00:07:16,818
Uh, absolutely.

176
00:07:16,887 --> 00:07:17,963
Uh, you're not gonna
eat this, are you?

177
00:07:17,987 --> 00:07:20,872
No. All right.

178
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:22,652
Spencer, I need you
to do hourly checks.

179
00:07:22,676 --> 00:07:24,337
Yes, sir. Oh, uh, just
steer clear of the mom.

180
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:26,027
She's a doc knocker.

181
00:07:26,096 --> 00:07:27,595
A what?

182
00:07:27,664 --> 00:07:29,709
A mom who's up for more
than your bedside manner.

183
00:07:29,733 --> 00:07:30,765
Know what I mean?

184
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:33,479
Really?

185
00:07:33,503 --> 00:07:34,647
She just seems like a
concerned mom to me.

186
00:07:34,671 --> 00:07:35,736
Her kid's...

187
00:07:35,823 --> 00:07:36,922
Just trust me.

188
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,334
Keep a buffer
between you and her,

189
00:07:38,358 --> 00:07:40,508
a stool, portable
X-ray, anything.

190
00:07:43,597 --> 00:07:44,645
I hate guys like that.

191
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:45,891
Just 'cause he
has a hot girlfriend,

192
00:07:45,915 --> 00:07:47,435
he thinks everyone
wants to bone him.

193
00:07:48,902 --> 00:07:52,064
Mr. Jaffee, we've
almost got the all-clear.

194
00:07:52,088 --> 00:07:53,332
We just need to
take you upstairs

195
00:07:53,356 --> 00:07:55,523
for a pre-op chest
X-ray and an EKG,

196
00:07:55,592 --> 00:07:56,808
and then we're good to go.

197
00:07:56,877 --> 00:07:59,343
So, you're gonna
need to lose the hat.

198
00:07:59,412 --> 00:08:01,763
He, uh, won't
take it off. I tried.

199
00:08:01,849 --> 00:08:04,382
Look, my late wife
gave me this hat.

200
00:08:04,451 --> 00:08:08,286
You know, I caught 22
prize-winning bluegills in it!

201
00:08:08,355 --> 00:08:10,922
It goes everywhere
I go. It's good luck.

202
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:13,541
And we found you a kidney,
so the hat's done its job.

203
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:14,725
Yeah.

204
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:16,405
Well, can't I just keep it?

205
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:17,429
Hand it over.

206
00:08:20,016 --> 00:08:21,849
Okay. But, uh...

207
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,102
Oh, my God.

208
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:28,039
Yeah, that showed
up a few months ago.

209
00:08:31,962 --> 00:08:33,573
Charge to 100. Press sync.

210
00:08:33,597 --> 00:08:34,612
Clear!

211
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:37,576
What do we have? Here you go.

212
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,644
What are you doing?

213
00:08:38,668 --> 00:08:40,885
Cardioverting, 150. Clear!

214
00:08:40,953 --> 00:08:42,281
Who are you? Get
away from my patient!

215
00:08:42,305 --> 00:08:43,883
Found the scrubs, by
the way. Thanks for that.

216
00:08:43,907 --> 00:08:45,368
Hey! Your patient?
Charge to 200.

217
00:08:45,392 --> 00:08:47,770
Hey, I'm in the middle of doing
something here! She's hypotensive!

218
00:08:47,794 --> 00:08:49,310
I can see that! Clear!

219
00:08:49,396 --> 00:08:50,962
Riggs?

220
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:52,271
Hunt! Do you know this person?

221
00:08:52,315 --> 00:08:53,543
What the hell are
you doing here?

222
00:08:53,567 --> 00:08:56,567
Hey, I'm trying to do
my job! Everyone stop!

223
00:08:56,687 --> 00:08:58,097
Who gave you privileges here?

224
00:08:58,121 --> 00:08:59,554
Well, you did.

225
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,674
When you hired me, right?

226
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:18,556
You hired someone for my
department without telling me?

227
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:20,041
Shoot. Riggs.

228
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:23,428
Uh, no, I was going to tell you.

229
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:24,841
You'll like him. I promise.

230
00:09:24,865 --> 00:09:26,631
I'd like to have
decided that for myself.

231
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,010
Oh, but he's great.

232
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:31,014
He was in line to be
chief of cardio at Duke.

233
00:09:31,038 --> 00:09:33,471
He's done incredible
amounts of relief work...

234
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,134
And you hired him here
without any discussion,

235
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:36,941
without asking a single...

236
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:38,654
Hunt, it's not your department.
What's your problem?

237
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:41,863
Look, Pierce, I'm sorry,
but he was available,

238
00:09:41,949 --> 00:09:43,826
we had an opening,
and I made a call.

239
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:45,467
And I'm the chief.

240
00:09:45,535 --> 00:09:48,669
Now, kindly go
away. I'm operating.

241
00:09:55,561 --> 00:09:57,807
Well, thanks for having my back.

242
00:09:57,831 --> 00:09:59,898
Huh? Right. No problem.

243
00:10:01,301 --> 00:10:03,412
So, how long have
you had this lump, sir?

244
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,069
Oh, not long.

245
00:10:05,138 --> 00:10:06,571
Um... Seven, eight months now.

246
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,334
And you never had it treated?

247
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:10,842
Well, it was just a little
bump at first, you know?

248
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,544
I thought it was a bug bite.

249
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:15,596
And then I thought
maybe it was a cyst.

250
00:10:17,067 --> 00:10:18,616
And then I was afraid.

251
00:10:18,685 --> 00:10:21,051
That they would kick
you off the transplant list.

252
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,803
I already called the grandkids.

253
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:24,873
Maybe I should've waited?

254
00:10:27,094 --> 00:10:29,160
This is not a plastics
case. I think it's a tumor.

255
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:30,907
That's what I was afraid of.

256
00:10:30,931 --> 00:10:33,442
I mean, if this is cancer, there's
no way he's getting that kidney.

257
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,634
Yeah, it's likely invaded
locally, the tumor.

258
00:10:35,702 --> 00:10:37,782
Uh, it's possibly metastasized.

259
00:10:38,038 --> 00:10:39,038
Sorry.

260
00:10:39,873 --> 00:10:41,993
Hey. Did we get the pet scans?

261
00:10:42,259 --> 00:10:43,769
I thought we were
waiting on neuro

262
00:10:43,793 --> 00:10:45,527
and ortho consults.

263
00:10:45,595 --> 00:10:47,824
Okay, we need to run oncology
staging on this mass right now.

264
00:10:47,848 --> 00:10:50,225
Pet scans ASAP
with renal precautions.

265
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:52,028
And why are these
consults taking so long?

266
00:10:52,052 --> 00:10:53,468
I'm sorry. I pushed.

267
00:10:53,537 --> 00:10:55,270
They were busy. That's fine.

268
00:10:55,338 --> 00:10:58,005
Just, uh, let me know
when we get them, okay?

269
00:10:58,941 --> 00:11:00,408
Okay.

270
00:11:00,477 --> 00:11:02,555
Why is she going easy on you?

271
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:04,111
What'd you do?

272
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,879
I have no idea.

273
00:11:05,948 --> 00:11:07,264
Okay.

274
00:11:08,101 --> 00:11:09,567
Hey. Oh.

275
00:11:09,636 --> 00:11:11,346
Um, any interest in trivia
night at a lesbian bar?

276
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:13,366
I'm not sure I know that
much about lesbians.

277
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:14,923
Funny. You're funny.

278
00:11:16,492 --> 00:11:18,070
Uh, listen, I'm just trying
to dip my toes in the pool.

279
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:19,305
Mmm. You know, the dating pool.

280
00:11:19,329 --> 00:11:21,362
It's been a while, and I
need, like, a wingman.

281
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:23,164
Or wingwoman. Whatever.

282
00:11:23,233 --> 00:11:24,810
Because women don't
buy drinks for sad loners...

283
00:11:24,834 --> 00:11:26,245
I have a date with
Jackson tonight.

284
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:27,518
Oh, that's great!

285
00:11:27,587 --> 00:11:28,669
Ah! I know!

286
00:11:28,738 --> 00:11:30,916
He, uh, asked me
to dinner to talk,

287
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,051
and I'm trying really hard

288
00:11:32,075 --> 00:11:33,252
not to get too excited about it.

289
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:34,887
Oh, but that's a start, so...

290
00:11:34,911 --> 00:11:36,911
Yes, yes, it's a light

291
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:38,490
at the end of a
long, dark tunnel.

292
00:11:38,514 --> 00:11:40,743
I'm so glad, April.
I'm so... Sorry, I...

293
00:11:40,767 --> 00:11:42,216
Yeah. No.

294
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:53,578
Got a sec? Hey. What's up?

295
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:55,046
Uh, well, uh, listen.

296
00:11:55,115 --> 00:11:58,450
You know, uh, Miranda
and I were talking,

297
00:11:58,518 --> 00:12:00,985
and she... Well, both of us,

298
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:03,788
we were wondering if
tonight you might, uh...

299
00:12:03,856 --> 00:12:05,434
Ah, I can't do anything tonight.

300
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,524
I'm going to dinner with April.

301
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:10,194
April? Really?

302
00:12:10,263 --> 00:12:11,595
Yeah. I asked her.

303
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:12,924
You know, I figure we're
in a pretty good place,

304
00:12:12,948 --> 00:12:14,460
and now we can actually talk...

305
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:15,550
That's fantastic.

306
00:12:15,619 --> 00:12:16,984
About divorce. So...

307
00:12:17,053 --> 00:12:19,187
Well, that's, um...

308
00:12:19,255 --> 00:12:20,955
Damn.

309
00:12:21,023 --> 00:12:23,291
I'm sorry, man. I
wish there was...

310
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,976
Yeah, I do, too. Thanks, man.

311
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:27,045
Another night, though?

312
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:29,013
Another night.

313
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:31,516
All right. Um, good luck.

314
00:12:31,585 --> 00:12:33,985
Yeah. See you at home, buddy.

315
00:12:34,521 --> 00:12:36,871
Yes, you will.

316
00:12:36,957 --> 00:12:39,791
I finally pinned down
Dr. Torres and Dr. Shepherd,

317
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:41,771
and they're looking
at Mr. Jaffee's scans.

318
00:12:41,795 --> 00:12:44,755
Okay, great. Tell
them I'll be right there.

319
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:46,275
How do you do that?

320
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:47,832
How do I do what?

321
00:12:47,901 --> 00:12:49,650
Work with Blake after...

322
00:12:49,719 --> 00:12:51,513
I mean, how are you doing that?

323
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:52,537
Oh.

324
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:58,709
Well, I thought that I could
treat her like any other resident.

325
00:12:58,779 --> 00:12:59,878
But that was really hard,

326
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:01,780
because I wanted to
punch her in the face.

327
00:13:01,848 --> 00:13:03,498
Like, a lot.

328
00:13:03,566 --> 00:13:05,010
So now I'm trying
something different.

329
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:08,269
I am keeping her on a
short leash at a distance

330
00:13:08,338 --> 00:13:09,938
so at least she can't
hurt anyone else.

331
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:13,119
I just don't think
I could do that.

332
00:13:13,143 --> 00:13:15,443
Well, she's here. She's
not going anywhere, so...

333
00:13:21,534 --> 00:13:23,685
Mrs. Brown? I'm Dr. Pierce.

334
00:13:23,753 --> 00:13:25,831
I'm the chief of
cardiothoracic surgery.

335
00:13:25,855 --> 00:13:28,022
And this is doctor... Dr. Riggs.

336
00:13:28,091 --> 00:13:30,541
Hi. Well, I'm glad to
see you awake, Loretta.

337
00:13:30,609 --> 00:13:32,176
You gave us a bit
of a scare, there.

338
00:13:32,245 --> 00:13:33,322
When can I go home?

339
00:13:33,346 --> 00:13:35,006
Uh, I'd like to run
some more tests

340
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:36,908
to determine whether
you'll need surgery.

341
00:13:36,932 --> 00:13:39,044
We've called your family.
They're on their way.

342
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:42,570
Dr. Riggs, do you
think I need surgery?

343
00:13:42,638 --> 00:13:44,683
Your echo shows a
reduction in blood flow

344
00:13:44,707 --> 00:13:46,018
through one of the
valves in your heart,

345
00:13:46,042 --> 00:13:47,719
so we just want
to make sure that...

346
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:50,445
I'd like to keep you overnight
to run some more tests.

347
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:52,925
And I'll take it
from there, okay?

348
00:13:52,949 --> 00:13:54,749
Dr. Riggs?

349
00:13:54,817 --> 00:13:57,137
You're gonna be
well taken care of.

350
00:14:02,726 --> 00:14:04,225
It's your first day.

351
00:14:04,293 --> 00:14:07,539
Might want to get your
feet wet before you dive in.

352
00:14:07,563 --> 00:14:08,630
Mmm.

353
00:14:08,698 --> 00:14:11,833
My feet were pretty
wet when I got here.

354
00:14:11,901 --> 00:14:14,668
Then you can get me
a cardiac-gated CT,

355
00:14:14,737 --> 00:14:16,565
and do a risk stratification.

356
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:18,122
Page me with the results.

357
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,193
Yes, ma'am. Thank you.

358
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:31,085
Well?

359
00:14:31,154 --> 00:14:32,719
Osteosarcoma.

360
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:35,051
It involves the frontal
and the occipital bone.

361
00:14:35,075 --> 00:14:36,574
It's locally very aggressive.

362
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:39,077
It's a lovely tumor.
It's almost cute.

363
00:14:39,145 --> 00:14:41,173
Just plopped there. "Hello."

364
00:14:41,197 --> 00:14:43,259
He's waited 18
months for this kidney.

365
00:14:43,283 --> 00:14:45,999
We finally have one,
and now he has cancer?

366
00:14:46,068 --> 00:14:48,068
What if he didn't? Didn't what?

367
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:50,433
Have cancer. His tumor
has gorgeous margins.

368
00:14:50,457 --> 00:14:52,991
It's like a ripe,
juicy piece of fruit

369
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:54,270
that's hung low on the branch.

370
00:14:54,294 --> 00:14:56,654
I could reach in and pluck it.

371
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:00,167
No cancer, no problem.

372
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:01,676
You can do that? No.

373
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:04,402
Even if you can
remove it... Oh, I can.

374
00:15:04,471 --> 00:15:06,415
Well, he's left with a
gaping hole in his head.

375
00:15:06,439 --> 00:15:08,139
No skull, no skin to cover it.

376
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:10,752
I fix brains. I give you
your soft, gooey center.

377
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:12,454
The hard candy shell
is your department.

378
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:13,758
No, there's no way to close it.

379
00:15:13,797 --> 00:15:14,997
Not even a rotational flap.

380
00:15:15,031 --> 00:15:17,081
There's nothing
to work with here.

381
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,749
And a wound that size,

382
00:15:18,818 --> 00:15:20,579
when his immune system
is already compromised,

383
00:15:20,603 --> 00:15:22,503
that could kick him
off the transplant list.

384
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:28,175
We have less than 24 hours
before we lose the kidney.

385
00:15:28,244 --> 00:15:31,429
So, Wilson and
Edwards, I need ideas.

386
00:15:31,498 --> 00:15:33,247
Crazy ideas, smart ideas.

387
00:15:33,315 --> 00:15:35,444
Give me anything that
will close Mr. Jaffee's head

388
00:15:35,468 --> 00:15:36,845
so he can survive this surgery.

389
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:38,514
Go. Hit the books.
Find me something.

390
00:15:38,538 --> 00:15:40,218
On it. Absolutely.

391
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:42,774
Dr. Grey?

392
00:15:43,726 --> 00:15:45,042
Should I look too, or...

393
00:15:45,094 --> 00:15:48,212
Blake. No, you should, um...

394
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:50,814
Go monitor the donor. Do that.

395
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:56,604
Make sure the brain-dead
guy is still brain-dead.

396
00:15:56,672 --> 00:15:58,038
Got it.

397
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:06,213
What are you doing? Excuse me?

398
00:16:06,983 --> 00:16:08,516
"Monitor the donor?"

399
00:16:08,585 --> 00:16:10,785
You've got Blake doing
scut that an intern could do.

400
00:16:10,854 --> 00:16:13,521
She is here to
learn. And, well...

401
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:15,122
Listen, Callie.

402
00:16:15,191 --> 00:16:18,437
When I teach her, you
say I am beating her down.

403
00:16:18,461 --> 00:16:20,945
When I'm nice to her,
you say I'm neglecting her.

404
00:16:21,013 --> 00:16:23,948
No, no, no. You're
neglecting your responsibility.

405
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:25,293
And if she were
any other resident...

406
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:26,829
If she were any other resident,

407
00:16:26,853 --> 00:16:28,380
you wouldn't be talking
to me right now, Callie.

408
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:30,349
I'm done talking
about your girlfriend.

409
00:16:30,373 --> 00:16:31,739
This is your problem.

410
00:16:31,807 --> 00:16:34,247
It's not Blake's,
and it's not mine.

411
00:16:35,645 --> 00:16:37,044
That's...

412
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:53,010
Ah! Oh!

413
00:16:53,079 --> 00:16:55,112
Oh, I didn't mean
to startle you.

414
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:56,547
Is he okay?

415
00:16:56,615 --> 00:17:00,084
Listen, you have nothing to
worry about. Gary's gonna be fine.

416
00:17:00,153 --> 00:17:01,313
I imagine it's
not the first time

417
00:17:01,337 --> 00:17:02,414
he's done something like this.

418
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:03,871
You're right. You get it.

419
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:06,123
You know, it can just
be so hard sometimes.

420
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:11,128
You know, he's a great
kid, but he can be a lot.

421
00:17:12,147 --> 00:17:14,293
Well, you're doing a great job.

422
00:17:14,317 --> 00:17:16,328
He's a great kid. Thank you.

423
00:17:16,352 --> 00:17:19,570
Thank you so much. You know,
you're so nice, and so helpful.

424
00:17:19,638 --> 00:17:20,905
Thank you.

425
00:17:20,974 --> 00:17:23,218
Oh, uh, that's... It's
not a problem at all.

426
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:24,482
Oh, um...

427
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:26,193
Uh-oh. Um...

428
00:17:26,262 --> 00:17:27,894
Ma'am... Ma'am!

429
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:29,091
It's Elaine.

430
00:17:29,115 --> 00:17:30,982
Oh, uh, Elaine, ma'am, I...

431
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,449
'Cause I have
the other patients.

432
00:17:32,518 --> 00:17:34,318
But I'll... Uh, bye.

433
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:37,107
Yeah, bye. I'll see
you in an hour?

434
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:40,074
Finally. God, what took so long?

435
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:42,254
Whoa. Relax. This was
nice of me, remember?

436
00:17:42,278 --> 00:17:43,956
I didn't know you were
gonna make the food.

437
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,212
She's cranky.

438
00:17:45,281 --> 00:17:47,715
Bailey hired a new cardio
guy without telling her.

439
00:17:47,784 --> 00:17:49,294
That's jacked. Who is this guy?

440
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:51,429
It just means I'm gonna have
to train another alpha male

441
00:17:51,453 --> 00:17:53,320
not to pee all over the place.

442
00:17:53,389 --> 00:17:54,550
Mmm. I hate it when they pee.

443
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:55,814
Derek peed a lot.

444
00:17:55,842 --> 00:17:57,119
Oh, come on.
We're not like that.

445
00:17:57,143 --> 00:17:58,754
When you got here,
you peed everywhere.

446
00:17:58,778 --> 00:18:00,005
It was disgusting.

447
00:18:00,029 --> 00:18:01,489
You had to be trained.
Nobody trained me.

448
00:18:01,513 --> 00:18:04,743
We trained you. It was
subtle. You didn't notice.

449
00:18:04,767 --> 00:18:06,111
Is that why you
made me get the food?

450
00:18:06,135 --> 00:18:08,130
Not even that.
It's the patients.

451
00:18:08,154 --> 00:18:10,599
It's the way that they always
look to the man in the room first

452
00:18:10,623 --> 00:18:12,356
no matter who
is talking to them.

453
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:14,308
Yes. That's a thing?

454
00:18:14,377 --> 00:18:15,587
Not for you.

455
00:18:15,611 --> 00:18:18,112
And then there's
the whole other thing.

456
00:18:19,716 --> 00:18:22,215
You know, I just... I thought
I was done with that here.

457
00:18:22,284 --> 00:18:24,018
This guy just comes in.

458
00:18:24,086 --> 00:18:26,587
He's taking consults without
even talking to me about it...

459
00:18:26,656 --> 00:18:27,896
What whole other thing?

460
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:31,925
That?

461
00:18:31,994 --> 00:18:33,806
Come on, is that a thing?

462
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:35,496
Of course it is.

463
00:18:35,565 --> 00:18:38,532
Here? Yeah, here. Anywhere.

464
00:18:38,601 --> 00:18:41,001
Ask Edwards. Ask Bailey.

465
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:42,920
I can't believe that.

466
00:18:42,989 --> 00:18:44,471
That's 'cause
it's not your thing.

467
00:18:48,344 --> 00:18:50,144
Okay, tell me what
you said to him.

468
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:52,246
How did you fight for our love?

469
00:18:54,784 --> 00:18:56,350
Well, um...

470
00:18:56,419 --> 00:18:57,885
What? I, uh...

471
00:18:59,288 --> 00:19:01,088
What did you say?

472
00:19:02,191 --> 00:19:05,409
Well, I started to, and...

473
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:07,759
Look, I would
have, but he told me

474
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,458
he's talking to
April about divorce,

475
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:11,648
and so... He's coming back here?

476
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:14,268
Do you get how serious this is?

477
00:19:14,336 --> 00:19:17,738
Oh, I am off my game. Ugh.

478
00:19:17,807 --> 00:19:20,002
I hired a new cardio surgeon
and forgot to tell Pierce.

479
00:19:20,026 --> 00:19:21,804
That's all the more reason
for us to use this time

480
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:23,505
right now while we have it.

481
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:25,140
When he's out at
what is bound to be

482
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,164
a very, very long
dinner. Oh, no, no.

483
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,134
He could come back here
any minute in the middle of stuff!

484
00:19:30,203 --> 00:19:31,864
Okay, this is our
window, Miranda.

485
00:19:31,888 --> 00:19:33,365
He's asking for a divorce.

486
00:19:33,389 --> 00:19:35,233
There's no telling when
we're getting our sofa back!

487
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:36,356
Oh, yes, there is.

488
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:38,136
It's when you tell
him to get the hell out!

489
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,695
When you get him to say,
"Thank you for your hospitality.

490
00:19:40,763 --> 00:19:43,430
"It is time for me
to leave your sofa."

491
00:19:43,499 --> 00:19:44,743
Miranda, come... No.

492
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,634
You don't get
it until you get it.

493
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:55,337
Oh, that was delicious.

494
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:57,912
Yeah, their pumpkin
ravioli never disappoints.

495
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:00,147
This has been really nice.

496
00:20:00,216 --> 00:20:01,949
Yeah.

497
00:20:02,018 --> 00:20:06,354
We've somehow managed to
finish our meal without actually...

498
00:20:06,422 --> 00:20:08,372
Talking. Right. Talking.

499
00:20:10,009 --> 00:20:11,249
Do we need to, though?

500
00:20:12,178 --> 00:20:13,293
I want to.

501
00:20:13,362 --> 00:20:14,862
If you do.

502
00:20:14,931 --> 00:20:17,064
But it...

503
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:20,501
It's been so nice just
having a meal with you.

504
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:23,403
We really should, though.

505
00:20:24,206 --> 00:20:25,306
We should talk.

506
00:20:26,426 --> 00:20:29,259
Yes. Yes. We should.

507
00:20:32,998 --> 00:20:34,164
Damn it.

508
00:20:36,152 --> 00:20:37,946
I'm... It's all right.

509
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:39,519
Duty calls. It's fine.

510
00:20:41,256 --> 00:20:43,891
I want to keep
talking, though. I do.

511
00:20:43,959 --> 00:20:44,999
Um...

512
00:20:46,261 --> 00:20:47,501
Tomorrow night?

513
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:50,110
Tomorrow night. Okay.

514
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:02,359
Help. Help!

515
00:21:06,198 --> 00:21:08,232
Someone, please.

516
00:21:09,218 --> 00:21:10,628
Do something. Dr. Hunt?

517
00:21:10,652 --> 00:21:11,952
I can't find her.

518
00:21:13,989 --> 00:21:15,956
Find who?

519
00:21:16,025 --> 00:21:17,719
Dr. Hunt. No, do something!

520
00:21:17,743 --> 00:21:19,823
Dr. Hunt. Dr. Hunt, Dr. Hunt.

521
00:21:22,865 --> 00:21:25,148
Are you okay? God.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

522
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:26,967
I was just sleeping.
Sorry. You can go.

523
00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:32,249
Are you sure that... Get out.

524
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:48,038
Here?

525
00:21:48,107 --> 00:21:51,227
Dr. Grey said monitor.
I am monitoring.

526
00:21:51,444 --> 00:21:53,043
Any luck?

527
00:21:53,112 --> 00:21:56,713
With the hole in
Mr. Jaffee's head? Nope.

528
00:21:56,782 --> 00:21:58,649
3D printing will take too long.

529
00:21:58,717 --> 00:22:02,253
A custom-based cranioplasty
won't work, so I'm...

530
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:03,361
How's the Holy Grail?

531
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:06,736
Can we not call him that?

532
00:22:07,293 --> 00:22:09,043
Sorry. Just...

533
00:22:09,111 --> 00:22:11,378
He was someone's
family member, you know?

534
00:22:11,447 --> 00:22:14,481
Someone's husband,
someone's dad.

535
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:19,303
To someone, he was everything.

536
00:22:21,857 --> 00:22:23,524
And now he's
everything to Mr. Jaffee.

537
00:22:25,127 --> 00:22:27,311
But after all this
time and waiting,

538
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:30,414
we probably won't
even get to use him.

539
00:22:31,984 --> 00:22:35,453
He's everything, and
it doesn't even matter.

540
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:36,987
It means nothing.

541
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:38,856
I know.

542
00:22:38,924 --> 00:22:40,440
It doesn't seem fair.

543
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:45,829
He's everything.

544
00:22:45,898 --> 00:22:47,781
Pardon?

545
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:51,118
He's everything. Oh,
my God, he's everything!

546
00:22:55,274 --> 00:22:57,258
A skull transplant?

547
00:22:57,326 --> 00:22:59,994
Skull and scalp, actually.

548
00:23:00,062 --> 00:23:03,275
Our kidney donor is a
perfect match for Mr. Jaffee,

549
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:06,450
which means that he's also a
match for the skull and scalp.

550
00:23:06,519 --> 00:23:07,896
Lower risk of rejection.

551
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,170
He's everything.

552
00:23:09,238 --> 00:23:10,566
We'll have all the
vascularized bone

553
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:12,317
and skin that we
need from the donor.

554
00:23:12,341 --> 00:23:14,108
Have you done this before?

555
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:17,311
I haven't. It's been done once.

556
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:19,858
It's a complex surgery,
but I think it'll work.

557
00:23:19,882 --> 00:23:21,359
Same donor, same surgery.

558
00:23:21,383 --> 00:23:24,551
Well, I'll start on the tumor
while you two start organ recovery.

559
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:26,820
Let's go get our kidney.

560
00:23:33,196 --> 00:23:35,590
Hey. Um, come out for
a drink with me tonight?

561
00:23:35,614 --> 00:23:37,181
It'll be fun. It's trivia night.

562
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:38,727
It can either be fun
or it can be trivia night.

563
00:23:38,751 --> 00:23:40,428
Come on. Broaden your horizons.

564
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:41,864
Plus, I don't really
want to go alone...

565
00:23:41,888 --> 00:23:43,820
Uh, Robbins. Huh?

566
00:23:43,889 --> 00:23:46,290
Did you know that Henri Giffard

567
00:23:46,359 --> 00:23:49,243
built the first powered
airship in 1852?

568
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,180
Um...

569
00:23:54,884 --> 00:23:55,899
Uh, no.

570
00:23:56,936 --> 00:23:58,902
I did.

571
00:23:58,971 --> 00:24:01,621
And I'm free tonight.

572
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,370
I'm always free
for trivia night.

573
00:24:03,643 --> 00:24:04,643
Hmm.

574
00:24:07,447 --> 00:24:09,758
Riggs, what happened?
Her heart's failing.

575
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:11,860
I've asked for a balloon
pump to buy us some time.

576
00:24:11,884 --> 00:24:14,184
What she needs is a
valve replacement, stat.

577
00:24:14,253 --> 00:24:15,497
Even better. Call up for an OR.

578
00:24:15,521 --> 00:24:17,554
Let's prep her for a sternotomy.

579
00:24:17,623 --> 00:24:19,417
Krista, not a sternotomy. Keep
prepping for a cath procedure.

580
00:24:19,441 --> 00:24:20,919
No. No?

581
00:24:20,943 --> 00:24:22,159
No. I need to open her up.

582
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:23,672
She won't survive
being open that long.

583
00:24:23,696 --> 00:24:25,240
I'll never get a catheter all
the way up into the heart.

584
00:24:25,264 --> 00:24:26,925
Riggs, I am doing
this procedure.

585
00:24:26,949 --> 00:24:29,083
And you will be doing
the wrong procedure.

586
00:24:29,151 --> 00:24:30,995
Prep for a TAVR. WOMAN:
Right away, Doctor.

587
00:24:31,019 --> 00:24:32,619
My name is on her chart.

588
00:24:32,688 --> 00:24:34,566
I want to be in that room so
that if something goes wrong...

589
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:38,509
Don't worry, Riggs. If
she dies, it'll be my fault.

590
00:24:38,578 --> 00:24:40,010
My wife's dying?

591
00:24:50,206 --> 00:24:52,150
Uh, Mr. Brown. Hello.

592
00:24:52,174 --> 00:24:53,485
We're taking Loretta
up to surgery right now.

593
00:24:53,509 --> 00:24:54,669
Okay.

594
00:24:54,693 --> 00:24:56,477
We're going to do
everything we can.

595
00:24:58,113 --> 00:25:00,381
Hang in there, Gary.

596
00:25:00,449 --> 00:25:01,926
How long ago did
the light stop blinking?

597
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:03,751
It stopped? I'm not sure.

598
00:25:03,819 --> 00:25:06,486
I might've missed
the last couple checks.

599
00:25:06,555 --> 00:25:07,821
Tell me what's wrong here.

600
00:25:09,124 --> 00:25:10,557
The ball came apart?

601
00:25:10,626 --> 00:25:12,276
Yeah. The ball came apart.

602
00:25:12,345 --> 00:25:14,628
And the ball had
little blinking lights.

603
00:25:14,696 --> 00:25:16,797
So what is missing?

604
00:25:16,865 --> 00:25:18,465
I don't...

605
00:25:20,069 --> 00:25:21,613
A battery. Right.

606
00:25:21,637 --> 00:25:24,738
Now the battery is
all the way over here.

607
00:25:24,806 --> 00:25:26,918
Now, if the acid from the
battery eats through his intestine...

608
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:29,243
It'll perf his bowel.

609
00:25:29,311 --> 00:25:30,355
Well, could we get it
with an endoscope?

610
00:25:30,379 --> 00:25:31,456
Well, we could have.

611
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,325
But now, thanks to you,
I have to open him up.

612
00:25:33,349 --> 00:25:35,360
So notify Karev that I'm
taking Gary to surgery,

613
00:25:35,384 --> 00:25:36,662
then you get a front-row seat

614
00:25:36,686 --> 00:25:38,926
to how bad you screwed this up.

615
00:25:41,023 --> 00:25:42,356
All right. See you in there.

616
00:25:42,425 --> 00:25:43,990
You won't, actually.

617
00:25:44,059 --> 00:25:45,392
I'll be in the donor's OR.

618
00:25:45,461 --> 00:25:47,939
Making sure that the kidney
doesn't grow legs and walk away.

619
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:49,396
What?

620
00:25:49,465 --> 00:25:51,927
Grey has me babysitting
the kidney until she needs it.

621
00:25:51,951 --> 00:25:53,428
Oh, come on. Callie.

622
00:25:53,452 --> 00:25:54,618
That is...

623
00:25:57,172 --> 00:25:58,722
Grey. Yeah?

624
00:25:58,791 --> 00:26:01,425
Blake is a third-year resident.
She should be in our surgery.

625
00:26:01,493 --> 00:26:02,876
The skull transplant.

626
00:26:02,945 --> 00:26:04,761
That is the learning
opportunity here.

627
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:06,108
She deserves a chance to see it.

628
00:26:06,132 --> 00:26:07,132
Callie...

629
00:26:08,083 --> 00:26:09,344
Callie, we talked about this.

630
00:26:09,368 --> 00:26:11,608
Blake needs to be
where I need her to be.

631
00:26:11,671 --> 00:26:12,881
You don't need
her with the donor.

632
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:14,821
You just want her
there. What for? Why?

633
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:16,357
Why are you doing this?

634
00:26:16,425 --> 00:26:17,552
What, do you just
want her to sit there

635
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:18,587
and think about what
happened to Derek?

636
00:26:18,611 --> 00:26:20,088
Callie, stop. No, I am sorry,

637
00:26:20,112 --> 00:26:22,224
but I can't just stand here
and... You're embarrassing me!

638
00:26:22,248 --> 00:26:23,592
Nobody asked
you to say anything,

639
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:25,936
so just shut up
and stay out of it.

640
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:36,243
All right.

641
00:26:36,312 --> 00:26:38,678
Now, I need you to... Hold on.

642
00:26:39,882 --> 00:26:42,049
I don't need her
to fight for me,

643
00:26:42,117 --> 00:26:43,333
but Callie is right.

644
00:26:43,401 --> 00:26:44,501
I'm here to learn.

645
00:26:44,569 --> 00:26:47,287
I want to learn, but
you have to teach me.

646
00:26:47,356 --> 00:26:49,489
Don't go easy on
me. Don't expect less.

647
00:26:49,558 --> 00:26:51,157
Treat me like
any other resident.

648
00:26:51,227 --> 00:26:53,343
Treat me worse. I don't care.

649
00:26:53,412 --> 00:26:55,612
Hate me, yell at
me, I can handle it.

650
00:26:55,681 --> 00:26:56,797
I will handle it.

651
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:59,066
You told me not
to quit, and I didn't.

652
00:26:59,134 --> 00:27:00,300
But you are right now.

653
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:03,770
And if you can't do
what you are here to do,

654
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:06,306
then please let me go.

655
00:27:17,202 --> 00:27:18,442
Are you gonna do something?

656
00:27:19,188 --> 00:27:20,203
I'm thinking.

657
00:27:24,026 --> 00:27:26,059
Let's prep for a sternotomy.
Let's open her up.

658
00:27:26,128 --> 00:27:27,638
Good choice. - I know.

659
00:27:27,662 --> 00:27:29,157
Come on. You
can say I was right.

660
00:27:29,181 --> 00:27:31,848
You weren't. She won't
survive a six-hour procedure.

661
00:27:31,917 --> 00:27:34,617
It's her best shot.
Listen, I get it, okay?

662
00:27:34,686 --> 00:27:36,415
I'd hate me, too,
the way I was hired.

663
00:27:36,439 --> 00:27:37,549
Bailey should've told you.

664
00:27:37,573 --> 00:27:38,872
10 blade.

665
00:27:38,941 --> 00:27:40,540
Bailey is the chief.

666
00:27:40,609 --> 00:27:42,353
Yeah, but it was
pretty messed up.

667
00:27:42,377 --> 00:27:44,006
I mean, you and I should've
had a proper sit-down.

668
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:45,612
I agree. Saw, please.

669
00:27:45,698 --> 00:27:47,709
You'd have seen me in my suit.

670
00:27:47,733 --> 00:27:49,015
It's nice.

671
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:51,596
I mean, it's probably
wrinkled, but it's clean.

672
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:53,581
No, it's definitely,
definitely clean.

673
00:27:53,605 --> 00:27:54,749
You would've asked
me where I'm from.

674
00:27:54,773 --> 00:27:56,707
Australia. Retract.

675
00:27:56,775 --> 00:27:59,126
And you'd guess
wrong. New Zealand.

676
00:27:59,194 --> 00:28:00,777
A common mistake.

677
00:28:00,846 --> 00:28:03,279
Seattle when I was seven,
then med school, fellowship.

678
00:28:03,349 --> 00:28:05,510
The Middle East for a long time.

679
00:28:05,534 --> 00:28:07,751
Prepare to make a
large aortic purse string.

680
00:28:07,819 --> 00:28:08,886
Why?

681
00:28:09,588 --> 00:28:11,238
Just do it.

682
00:28:11,306 --> 00:28:12,572
Why the Middle East?

683
00:28:13,275 --> 00:28:14,435
Relief work.

684
00:28:14,476 --> 00:28:17,210
I like the pace, the
people, improvisation.

685
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:20,408
I once re-inflated a
collapsed pulmonary artery

686
00:28:20,432 --> 00:28:23,411
on a dirt road with a
straw and a set of car keys.

687
00:28:23,435 --> 00:28:25,201
Oh, you'd like that story.

688
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:27,437
Yeah, you'd be
asking me all about it.

689
00:28:27,506 --> 00:28:29,317
You'd be so impressed.
You'd be thinking,

690
00:28:29,341 --> 00:28:32,236
"Wow! He's so innovative. And
he's quick. I should hire him."

691
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:33,960
Would I? Mmm-hmm.

692
00:28:34,029 --> 00:28:36,408
Oh, yes. At this point, the
interview's going very well.

693
00:28:36,432 --> 00:28:37,697
Take this.

694
00:28:37,766 --> 00:28:39,216
3-0 prolene.

695
00:28:39,285 --> 00:28:42,186
But the kicker is
when I ask about you.

696
00:28:42,254 --> 00:28:44,566
How you landed a
fellowship at the age of 25.

697
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:46,551
How you made chief
of cardio at an age

698
00:28:46,575 --> 00:28:49,454
when most of us are still
starting out in our specialties.

699
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:50,688
I'd ask about some of your

700
00:28:50,712 --> 00:28:53,714
twenty-odd published
papers that I've read.

701
00:28:53,782 --> 00:28:57,045
Mostly, I'd like to know what
the hell you're doing right now.

702
00:28:57,069 --> 00:28:59,803
Trans-aortic valve replacement.

703
00:28:59,871 --> 00:29:01,171
By not putting her on bypass,

704
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:03,189
I turn your six-hour
procedure into...

705
00:29:03,258 --> 00:29:05,642
Into a one-hour
procedure. Brilliant.

706
00:29:06,445 --> 00:29:08,178
Bloody brilliant.

707
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:09,758
Look, it may seem like
Bailey hired me on a whim,

708
00:29:09,782 --> 00:29:12,060
but I don't do
anything on a whim.

709
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:15,564
I like to choose the
people that I work for.

710
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:21,219
When...

711
00:29:21,243 --> 00:29:23,603
When Wilson told
me that you lied...

712
00:29:24,629 --> 00:29:26,629
About, uh, being sick...

713
00:29:29,885 --> 00:29:31,751
I believed her.

714
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:32,900
Mmm-hmm.

715
00:29:36,142 --> 00:29:38,582
You didn't think that
that... That that was what?

716
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:43,330
That I sided with her because...

717
00:29:44,933 --> 00:29:46,266
No.

718
00:29:46,335 --> 00:29:47,834
Good. Good.

719
00:29:49,154 --> 00:29:51,554
I mean, it crossed
my mind, but no.

720
00:29:52,491 --> 00:29:53,640
It crossed your mind?

721
00:29:53,709 --> 00:29:54,949
Yeah, of course it did.

722
00:29:54,977 --> 00:29:58,561
I mean, it's always a
possibility. It's always there.

723
00:30:00,181 --> 00:30:01,481
But it wasn't.

724
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:03,533
With me you have to know...

725
00:30:03,601 --> 00:30:04,951
Hey, Dr. Shepherd...

726
00:30:07,205 --> 00:30:08,471
We are good.

727
00:30:56,654 --> 00:30:57,721
Blake.

728
00:31:06,098 --> 00:31:07,842
Okay. MEREDITH:
Where are you going?

729
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:09,165
You want to stand in the corner

730
00:31:09,234 --> 00:31:11,329
while I attach the Holy
Grail of kidneys, be my guest.

731
00:31:11,353 --> 00:31:12,764
No, no. Okay.

732
00:31:12,788 --> 00:31:15,272
So let's give Wilson a
break, and step on in here.

733
00:31:20,261 --> 00:31:22,346
I've prepared the
vessels for anastomosis,

734
00:31:22,414 --> 00:31:24,831
and I like an end-to-end
with the internal iliac.

735
00:31:28,754 --> 00:31:30,674
Give me some
room here. Get back.

736
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:34,808
So, wanna tell me why
you missed the checks?

737
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,277
Dr. Karev warned me

738
00:31:37,346 --> 00:31:39,291
to steer clear of the
kid's mom, and I didn't,

739
00:31:39,315 --> 00:31:41,109
and she sort of jumped me.

740
00:31:41,133 --> 00:31:42,415
She's a doc knocker.

741
00:31:42,484 --> 00:31:43,724
That's a thing?

742
00:31:43,752 --> 00:31:44,884
It is very much a thing.

743
00:31:45,787 --> 00:31:46,915
How did he see that?

744
00:31:46,939 --> 00:31:49,656
I swear I just saw
a nice, scared mom.

745
00:31:49,725 --> 00:31:51,625
Let me tell you what Karev saw.

746
00:31:51,693 --> 00:31:54,694
A concerned mom with a
kid who takes a lot of energy

747
00:31:54,762 --> 00:31:56,491
and a husband who only
looks up from his phone

748
00:31:56,515 --> 00:31:58,315
to contradict
everything that she says.

749
00:31:58,384 --> 00:32:01,501
A mom who was
presented with a doctor

750
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:04,971
who was only interested
in her son's well-being.

751
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,856
Made her feel
good, taken care of.

752
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:09,358
Suction.

753
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:11,256
I didn't see that.
Of course not.

754
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,941
You've only been a
doctor for five minutes.

755
00:32:12,965 --> 00:32:14,097
But you'll learn.

756
00:32:14,166 --> 00:32:16,149
People aren't always
who you think they are.

757
00:32:16,218 --> 00:32:18,585
You learn to see
through it. You learn fast.

758
00:32:18,653 --> 00:32:20,770
Oh. There it is. Right there.

759
00:32:22,091 --> 00:32:23,323
You want to get it?

760
00:32:28,963 --> 00:32:30,062
Chief.

761
00:32:30,131 --> 00:32:31,409
Looks like both of
Mr. Jaffee's transplants

762
00:32:31,433 --> 00:32:32,510
were successful.

763
00:32:32,534 --> 00:32:33,900
Oh, great news.

764
00:32:33,968 --> 00:32:36,019
Oh, Dr. Riggs.
How you settling in?

765
00:32:36,088 --> 00:32:37,715
Well, you'd have to ask
Dr. Pierce that, I think.

766
00:32:37,739 --> 00:32:39,717
Well, have you met everybody?

767
00:32:39,741 --> 00:32:43,327
Um... Dr. Nathan Riggs, this
is Grey, Shepherd, this is Hunt.

768
00:32:43,395 --> 00:32:44,522
Nice to meet you. Riggs.

769
00:32:44,546 --> 00:32:46,586
Hunt! Hey.

770
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,833
Yeah, we, um...

771
00:32:50,902 --> 00:32:53,403
Dr. Hunt and I go back a bit.

772
00:32:53,472 --> 00:32:55,650
Oh! Oh, I didn't realize. - No.

773
00:32:55,674 --> 00:32:56,840
No, you didn't.

774
00:32:56,908 --> 00:32:58,725
Maybe you should've asked around

775
00:32:58,794 --> 00:33:01,778
before you decided to bring a
complete stranger into the hospital.

776
00:33:01,847 --> 00:33:03,191
All right, Owen, why
don't you and I just...

777
00:33:03,215 --> 00:33:05,532
Did you think this
was how it was done?

778
00:33:05,601 --> 00:33:07,166
Didn't you think for one second

779
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:08,715
that, as chief of this hospital,

780
00:33:08,753 --> 00:33:11,004
it is your responsibility
to vet your people?

781
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:13,573
'Cause this, this is
a bad call, Bailey.

782
00:33:13,642 --> 00:33:15,491
This is a really bad call.

783
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,440
And it was thoughtless,
and it was reckless...

784
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:19,746
Hunt.

785
00:33:19,815 --> 00:33:23,495
Why don't we go to my
office and talk about this?

786
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:37,450
What's done is done, right?

787
00:33:58,487 --> 00:34:00,527
What did he say? Nothing.

788
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:03,339
Whatever this is...

789
00:34:05,177 --> 00:34:06,225
He's not talking.

790
00:34:08,947 --> 00:34:10,329
Meredith...

791
00:34:16,922 --> 00:34:19,203
I made a promise to Cristina

792
00:34:19,258 --> 00:34:20,635
that I wouldn't let
you go dark and twisty,

793
00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:22,940
that I'd be your person
if you needed one.

794
00:34:24,996 --> 00:34:26,996
I don't want to talk.

795
00:34:27,365 --> 00:34:28,525
Okay.

796
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:30,533
You don't have to.

797
00:34:30,602 --> 00:34:32,922
But just tell me,
do we hate him?

798
00:34:39,828 --> 00:34:41,427
We hate him.

799
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:45,955
Okay, then. We hate him.

800
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:58,061
So, um, how'd it go last night?

801
00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:00,196
It didn't.

802
00:35:00,265 --> 00:35:03,300
I mean, dinner was
great. It was fun, actually.

803
00:35:03,368 --> 00:35:05,346
But when it was finally
time to have the real talk,

804
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:07,770
April got paged.

805
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:11,825
Honestly, I think we were both
trying to avoid the subject, but...

806
00:35:11,893 --> 00:35:14,577
Yeah, I need to
have sex with my wife.

807
00:35:14,646 --> 00:35:16,424
And that can't happen
with you in my house.

808
00:35:16,448 --> 00:35:18,159
Now, you're in a
bad place. I get that.

809
00:35:18,183 --> 00:35:20,694
And I will do anything
I can to... I will.

810
00:35:20,718 --> 00:35:23,069
But I need you off my sofa.

811
00:35:23,138 --> 00:35:24,398
I mean, it's for the
good of the hospital...

812
00:35:24,422 --> 00:35:26,372
Totally get it. Okay?

813
00:35:26,441 --> 00:35:28,321
I'll see you. All right.

814
00:35:32,146 --> 00:35:34,158
I mean, how did he seem to you?

815
00:35:34,182 --> 00:35:36,022
Riggs? Yeah.

816
00:35:36,051 --> 00:35:40,587
I don't know. Smart,
capable, charming. Ugh.

817
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:43,422
I think Bailey was right.

818
00:35:44,659 --> 00:35:46,525
Owen wouldn't tell you anything?

819
00:35:46,595 --> 00:35:49,696
He just shut me
out. I don't know why.

820
00:35:49,764 --> 00:35:51,798
And then...

821
00:35:51,866 --> 00:35:54,067
I'm afraid I
might've been racist.

822
00:35:54,135 --> 00:35:55,434
God, I hate this day.

823
00:35:55,503 --> 00:35:58,254
Okay. Okay, back it up.

824
00:35:58,323 --> 00:35:59,989
Oh, good. I can
talk to you about this.

825
00:36:00,058 --> 00:36:03,393
I am worried I offended Edwards.

826
00:36:03,461 --> 00:36:04,611
I need you to tell me.

827
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:07,663
Why me? 'Cause I'm your sister?

828
00:36:07,732 --> 00:36:10,428
Yes. Or because
I'm your "sistah"?

829
00:36:10,452 --> 00:36:13,002
No. This is exactly
what I was worried about.

830
00:36:13,071 --> 00:36:15,183
Okay. What do you think you did?

831
00:36:15,207 --> 00:36:18,591
I don't think I did anything,
but I think she thinks I did.

832
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:21,294
Amelia, use your words.

833
00:36:21,363 --> 00:36:23,113
Did what?

834
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:26,782
Sided with Wilson over
her because she's black.

835
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:30,420
Which I didn't do. I think...

836
00:36:30,489 --> 00:36:33,473
God, I hate that this is
even an issue all of a sudden.

837
00:36:33,542 --> 00:36:36,709
Well, it's not an issue for you.

838
00:36:36,778 --> 00:36:39,646
And it's not all of a sudden.

839
00:36:39,714 --> 00:36:42,059
I mean, okay, it's not
<i>Mississippi Burning</i> or anything,

840
00:36:42,083 --> 00:36:45,351
but it is all over.

841
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:47,780
It's when people
assume I'm a nurse.

842
00:36:48,607 --> 00:36:50,134
Or when I go to
get on an airplane

843
00:36:50,158 --> 00:36:52,070
with my first-class ticket,

844
00:36:52,094 --> 00:36:54,806
and they tell me that they're
not boarding coach yet.

845
00:36:54,830 --> 00:36:57,296
It's like a low buzz
in the background.

846
00:36:57,365 --> 00:36:58,926
And sometimes you
don't even notice it,

847
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:01,651
and sometimes it's
loud and annoying.

848
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:05,021
And sometimes it
can get dangerous.

849
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:08,724
And sometimes it is
ridiculous, like right now.

850
00:37:09,427 --> 00:37:10,726
But it's not funny.

851
00:37:10,795 --> 00:37:12,089
I mean, if I'm doing it
and I don't even notice it...

852
00:37:12,113 --> 00:37:13,353
Then notice it.

853
00:37:15,867 --> 00:37:18,912
Look, did Edwards
tell you that she's okay?

854
00:37:18,936 --> 00:37:20,086
Yes.

855
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:22,322
Okay.

856
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:25,425
Then don't give
her the extra work

857
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:27,893
of having to make
you feel good about it.

858
00:37:29,147 --> 00:37:30,646
Right.

859
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:35,363
Okay, but how do I
know that she's really...

860
00:37:35,387 --> 00:37:38,688
Because she knows you, okay?

861
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:42,092
So listen to the words that
are coming out of her mouth

862
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,242
and believe them.

863
00:37:43,311 --> 00:37:44,960
This is not a small thing.

864
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:48,142
And I'm glad that you feel like

865
00:37:48,166 --> 00:37:49,332
you can talk to me about it,

866
00:37:51,035 --> 00:37:53,336
but I don't speak
for all black people.

867
00:37:53,405 --> 00:37:56,906
I am not the
spokeswoman. No one is.

868
00:37:56,974 --> 00:38:01,077
And it is kind of annoying to
be asked questions like I am.

869
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:06,049
But, uh, one piece of
advice that I can give you

870
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:07,295
that I think we
would all agree with

871
00:38:07,319 --> 00:38:11,487
is that if you feel
uncomfortable having done it,

872
00:38:13,191 --> 00:38:15,891
check your white privilege,

873
00:38:15,961 --> 00:38:17,260
and don't do it again.

874
00:38:21,015 --> 00:38:23,015
But I don't think you're racist.

875
00:38:25,253 --> 00:38:26,619
You don't think?

876
00:38:27,455 --> 00:38:29,306
Girl, get in the car.

877
00:38:29,374 --> 00:38:30,674
Okay.

878
00:38:47,776 --> 00:38:50,104
He had so many
grandkids I lost count.

879
00:38:50,128 --> 00:38:51,761
I'm not exaggerating.

880
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:54,013
Seven.

881
00:38:54,082 --> 00:38:56,144
He had seven
grandchildren from six kids,

882
00:38:56,168 --> 00:38:58,518
who he raised on his
own after his wife died.

883
00:38:59,571 --> 00:39:00,771
Are you okay?

884
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:04,490
I treated Mr. Jaffee for years,

885
00:39:04,558 --> 00:39:07,126
and I finally get
him what he needs,

886
00:39:07,195 --> 00:39:09,862
and you just come and
take it and run with it.

887
00:39:10,698 --> 00:39:13,065
And I helped you all day.

888
00:39:17,872 --> 00:39:19,538
He was my patient.

889
00:39:20,475 --> 00:39:21,540
That's all.

890
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,226
Jo.

891
00:39:28,332 --> 00:39:31,334
So, you want to grab a drink?

892
00:39:34,939 --> 00:39:35,939
Yeah.

893
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:40,677
I would love that, actually.

894
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:42,612
Okay.

895
00:39:46,784 --> 00:39:49,785
So, um, we've got
science covered.

896
00:39:49,854 --> 00:39:52,288
I'm strong on history
and geography.

897
00:39:52,356 --> 00:39:53,706
How's your popular culture?

898
00:39:53,775 --> 00:39:55,352
I just want to get a sense
of our strengths here...

899
00:39:55,376 --> 00:39:56,616
Richard, I'm sorry.

900
00:39:57,362 --> 00:39:58,845
I'm here to...

901
00:39:58,914 --> 00:40:01,274
I wanted to have...
I'm trying to...

902
00:40:01,782 --> 00:40:03,022
I'm here to meet girls.

903
00:40:04,035 --> 00:40:05,179
I don't care about trivia.

904
00:40:05,203 --> 00:40:07,264
I don't even like trivia.

905
00:40:07,288 --> 00:40:08,304
Oh.

906
00:40:11,743 --> 00:40:13,526
I see. That's...

907
00:40:13,595 --> 00:40:16,740
And then you offered to come,
and I didn't know how to say no.

908
00:40:16,764 --> 00:40:19,310
And I just... I didn't want
to go it alone, honestly.

909
00:40:19,334 --> 00:40:20,544
It's just it's been a long time,

910
00:40:20,568 --> 00:40:22,280
and I'm rusty and nervous.

911
00:40:22,304 --> 00:40:23,915
And I feel like I
lived an entire lifetime

912
00:40:23,939 --> 00:40:25,616
since the last time I dated,

913
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:27,801
and I don't even
know where to start.

914
00:40:27,825 --> 00:40:29,525
You need a wingman.

915
00:40:32,297 --> 00:40:33,462
What do you like?

916
00:40:33,531 --> 00:40:34,697
Glasses?

917
00:40:34,766 --> 00:40:36,732
Cardigan. She has a nice laugh.

918
00:40:37,635 --> 00:40:38,784
You into tattoos?

919
00:40:42,157 --> 00:40:44,006
Not that many tattoos.

920
00:40:44,075 --> 00:40:45,652
Well, you know, I'm just
trying to get a sense of

921
00:40:45,676 --> 00:40:46,792
what we're after here.

922
00:40:49,998 --> 00:40:51,414
Glasses is cute.

923
00:40:52,583 --> 00:40:53,783
I'll be right back.

924
00:40:55,219 --> 00:40:56,519
Sit up straight.

925
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:01,040
Hello, ladies.

926
00:41:01,108 --> 00:41:03,948
<i>It's hard to fight
against certain biases.</i>

927
00:41:04,545 --> 00:41:07,313
<i>It's important to
keep an open mind.</i>

928
00:41:07,382 --> 00:41:09,115
<i>It's how we learn.</i>

929
00:41:09,184 --> 00:41:10,516
<i>It's how we grow.</i>

930
00:41:10,585 --> 00:41:11,917
Hey.

931
00:41:11,986 --> 00:41:13,419
<i>It's how we move forward.</i>

932
00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:17,230
Dr. Grey, right? Yep.

933
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:21,038
Yours is easy to remember.

934
00:41:21,062 --> 00:41:23,263
It's on all the
hospital stationery.

935
00:41:25,533 --> 00:41:26,773
What's the story there?

936
00:41:27,736 --> 00:41:29,696
That's too long a story to tell.

937
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:35,803
I was actually headed
across the street.

938
00:41:35,827 --> 00:41:37,671
I was gonna grab a
drink or something.

939
00:41:37,695 --> 00:41:40,135
Are you headed that way, or...

940
00:41:43,368 --> 00:41:45,251
I'm a friend of Owen Hunt's.

941
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,652
<i>Until we don't.</i>

942
00:41:49,624 --> 00:41:51,257
I see.

943
00:41:51,326 --> 00:41:52,625
So, no.

944
00:41:55,963 --> 00:41:57,923
<i>Until we let our bias take over.</i>

945
00:42:05,206 --> 00:42:07,106
<i>Until we succumb</i>

946
00:42:07,175 --> 00:42:11,594
<i>to what feels right or good
or satisfying in that moment.</i>

947
00:42:11,663 --> 00:42:15,447
<i>Because even then,
deep down inside,</i>

948
00:42:15,516 --> 00:42:18,484
<i>we usually know
we're going to regret it.</i>
