00:00:04,972 --> 00:00:07,612
<i>Infections have a nasty
way of sneaking up on you.</i>

2
00:00:13,864 --> 00:00:15,397
<i>You're feeling pretty good,</i>

3
00:00:15,466 --> 00:00:17,299
<i>you think the infection's gone,</i>

4
00:00:17,368 --> 00:00:19,867
<i>and then it reappears,</i>

5
00:00:19,936 --> 00:00:22,270
<i>out of nowhere,</i>

6
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:24,189
<i>when your body's still weak,</i>

7
00:00:24,258 --> 00:00:25,807
<i>when you've barely recovered.</i>

8
00:00:26,761 --> 00:00:27,761
Hey.

9
00:00:27,812 --> 00:00:28,876
Hey.

10
00:00:28,946 --> 00:00:30,045
What's all this?

11
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:31,963
Sold it. I'm done with it.

12
00:00:32,033 --> 00:00:33,414
With the trailer?

13
00:00:33,484 --> 00:00:35,350
Yep. Don't need it anymore.

14
00:00:35,418 --> 00:00:36,918
Don't you need a place to sleep,

15
00:00:36,987 --> 00:00:39,616
or are you moving into my
house, too, and no one told me?

16
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,518
Better. I just bought
my own house.

17
00:00:41,542 --> 00:00:42,803
Closing it this morning.

18
00:00:42,827 --> 00:00:44,887
Amelia's been
giving me a hard time

19
00:00:44,911 --> 00:00:46,890
about getting a
grown-up house, so...

20
00:00:46,914 --> 00:00:48,980
So, no more trailer.

21
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:51,016
<i>Bam. You're
infected all over again.</i>

22
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:52,601
Yeah.

23
00:00:54,755 --> 00:00:55,949
Is this... Should I
have asked you?

24
00:00:55,973 --> 00:00:57,467
I should've asked you. No, no.

25
00:00:57,491 --> 00:00:59,820
You paid for it. It's yours
to do what you want with.

26
00:00:59,844 --> 00:01:01,288
You sure? Yes.

27
00:01:01,312 --> 00:01:03,156
Congratulations
on the new house.

28
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:04,346
Thanks.

29
00:01:05,683 --> 00:01:07,803
<i>And once the infection spreads,</i>

30
00:01:07,852 --> 00:01:09,629
<i>once it gets into
your bloodstream,</i>

31
00:01:09,653 --> 00:01:12,504
<i>well, then you really
have to watch it.</i>

32
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:16,591
<i>'Cause that's the
kind of infection</i>

33
00:01:19,029 --> 00:01:20,996
<i>that can kill you.</i>

34
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:35,372
Catherine's back
in town next week.

35
00:01:35,396 --> 00:01:37,573
Thought it'd be nice to
have some people over.

36
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:39,731
Well, nothing
fancy, just dinner.

37
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,099
Who's in?

38
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:47,806
You know, that's a
fine idea, Dr. Webber.

39
00:01:47,874 --> 00:01:49,619
Oh, sorry.

40
00:01:49,643 --> 00:01:51,676
Yes, yes, yes.
Thanks. Absolutely.

41
00:01:51,745 --> 00:01:53,445
Okay. Avery said yes.

42
00:01:53,513 --> 00:01:55,258
Uh, how about you?
Yeah, I'll be there.

43
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:56,359
Okay. I'm not sure about

44
00:01:56,383 --> 00:01:58,578
Dr. Warren's schedule, though.

45
00:02:00,337 --> 00:02:03,939
Okay. Um, Warren?

46
00:02:04,008 --> 00:02:05,652
Uh, yeah, I'm
in. I'm in. All right.

47
00:02:05,676 --> 00:02:07,192
Uh, what can I bring?

48
00:02:07,261 --> 00:02:09,761
Um, I wouldn't say
no to that artichoke dip

49
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,441
you brought to
the resident mixer.

50
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:13,165
Well, that's...

51
00:02:13,234 --> 00:02:15,394
That's Miranda's secret recipe.

52
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,053
Okay.

53
00:02:20,374 --> 00:02:22,274
I see.

54
00:02:22,343 --> 00:02:23,842
I'll bring it.

55
00:02:31,201 --> 00:02:32,521
Should be a great party.

56
00:02:35,689 --> 00:02:38,357
Hey, Maggie, did you hear
that Owen bought a house?

57
00:02:38,425 --> 00:02:41,171
Oh, good, now you can
naked snuggle on his sofa.

58
00:02:41,195 --> 00:02:43,540
Wait. Furniture, right. I
need some of that. Suction.

59
00:02:43,564 --> 00:02:46,264
No black recliners, I beg you.

60
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,044
And nothing you have
to assemble yourself.

61
00:02:48,068 --> 00:02:49,745
You got a real house,
get some real furniture,

62
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:51,219
keep the momentum going.

63
00:02:51,288 --> 00:02:52,598
Hey, maybe you should
come shopping with me,

64
00:02:52,622 --> 00:02:54,234
point me in the right direction.

65
00:02:54,258 --> 00:02:56,236
Then you'll just wind up with
a house full of furniture I like.

66
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,737
I don't see that as a problem.

67
00:02:57,761 --> 00:03:00,245
I want stuff we both can enjoy.

68
00:03:00,297 --> 00:03:01,797
Wait. What? Why?

69
00:03:01,865 --> 00:03:04,444
Is she... Are you
moving in with him?

70
00:03:04,468 --> 00:03:05,611
Duval forceps, please.

71
00:03:05,635 --> 00:03:06,701
Oh, No.

72
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,503
I mean, that's
not... I don't think...

73
00:03:08,572 --> 00:03:10,322
Why not? Just think about it.

74
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,472
It's pretty big.

75
00:03:11,559 --> 00:03:15,543
Nice yard. Good school district.

76
00:03:15,613 --> 00:03:17,090
I'm sorry.

77
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:19,125
Did you just go from
moving in to having kids?

78
00:03:19,149 --> 00:03:21,483
Boy, you guys move fast.

79
00:03:21,569 --> 00:03:23,046
I couldn't even sleep in
the same bed as my fiance.

80
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:24,264
We were engaged for a year.

81
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,931
Long engagements, bad idea.

82
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:27,500
I agree. Better to go straight

83
00:03:27,524 --> 00:03:29,402
to the marriage
part. It's better.

84
00:03:29,426 --> 00:03:30,742
Would you get married again?

85
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:32,977
I'd consider it, with
the right person.

86
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,529
You would?

87
00:03:34,598 --> 00:03:36,558
I'd strongly consider it, yes.

88
00:03:37,434 --> 00:03:38,450
Me, too.

89
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:40,685
With the right person.

90
00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:41,903
Okay, then.

91
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:43,015
Wait. What?

92
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:46,708
Did you... What just happened?

93
00:03:46,777 --> 00:03:48,093
Are you engaged now?

94
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:49,288
What? No. No.

95
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:50,395
Hypotheticals.

96
00:03:50,463 --> 00:03:51,725
We were just...
That was nothing.

97
00:03:51,749 --> 00:03:53,989
We were just talking.
We were just...

98
00:03:57,605 --> 00:03:59,633
Maggie, we were just talking.

99
00:03:59,657 --> 00:04:02,057
Oh, please. How long
you think till you move out?

100
00:04:02,126 --> 00:04:03,291
Who's moving out?

101
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,259
Amelia, when she
marries Owen Hunt

102
00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:07,812
and moves into his big,
new, kid-friendly house.

103
00:04:07,865 --> 00:04:09,175
No, no. Okay, hang on.

104
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:10,476
It was a hypothetical
conversation.

105
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,866
That is it.

106
00:04:11,935 --> 00:04:14,152
In which you were picking
out hypothetical furniture

107
00:04:14,221 --> 00:04:16,888
for your hypothetical
children's hypothetical playroom.

108
00:04:16,957 --> 00:04:18,401
Wow. It was nothing.

109
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:19,736
Can we drop it, please? Why?

110
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,760
Gladly.

111
00:04:23,097 --> 00:04:24,662
Gladly? Why gladly?
What's wrong?

112
00:04:24,715 --> 00:04:26,081
Do you see a dilation?

113
00:04:26,149 --> 00:04:28,349
I'm worried about
medullary sponge kidney.

114
00:04:28,802 --> 00:04:30,030
You didn't answer my question.

115
00:04:30,054 --> 00:04:31,114
You didn't answer mine.

116
00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:32,582
You think we're moving too fast?

117
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:33,738
Is that it?

118
00:04:33,807 --> 00:04:35,040
Amelia, please.

119
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,242
You're the one who
pushed us back together.

120
00:04:37,311 --> 00:04:40,112
You know, you
practically yelled at me

121
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,547
to run back into
his arms, and now...

122
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:44,249
Thanks for the consult.

123
00:04:55,178 --> 00:04:56,956
I called the landlord,

124
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:59,492
and he agreed to swap
out our two-bedroom lease

125
00:04:59,516 --> 00:05:02,350
for something smaller, since...

126
00:05:02,419 --> 00:05:04,664
I mean, I figured that
I could save on rent

127
00:05:04,688 --> 00:05:06,087
while I'm at Preminger,

128
00:05:06,155 --> 00:05:08,835
so I can afford to fly back
on weekends to Seattle

129
00:05:08,859 --> 00:05:12,043
to, you know,
visit you and Sofia.

130
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:13,545
Okay.

131
00:05:13,613 --> 00:05:15,397
Okay? Yeah, sounds good.

132
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:22,716
I don't want to leave
when we're like this.

133
00:05:22,773 --> 00:05:24,350
We've barely
talked since the trial.

134
00:05:24,374 --> 00:05:26,425
I really don't know what to say.

135
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:30,928
Neither do I, but I am trying to
say words and to be here and help.

136
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:32,897
You've helped enough.

137
00:05:35,135 --> 00:05:36,201
Okay.

138
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:41,756
Okay.

139
00:05:50,718 --> 00:05:52,662
X-rays came back
clear. No breaks.

140
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:54,252
We got lucky, Nash.

141
00:05:54,321 --> 00:05:55,887
So listen to your grandma

142
00:05:55,956 --> 00:05:58,990
the next time she tells you not
to climb the bookshelves, okay?

143
00:05:59,059 --> 00:06:00,192
All right.

144
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:06,776
Thank you, Doctor.

145
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,880
You have been so
good with him today,

146
00:06:08,936 --> 00:06:11,181
so patient, and I
can't help but notice

147
00:06:11,205 --> 00:06:13,099
I don't see a ring
on your finger.

148
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:14,456
Excuse me?

149
00:06:14,525 --> 00:06:16,269
You should meet my
daughter. Nash's mom.

150
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:18,726
Not the sharpest
tack, but really sweet,

151
00:06:18,796 --> 00:06:20,195
really pretty.

152
00:06:20,263 --> 00:06:22,948
Ma'am, I appreciate the offer,
but I'm with someone already.

153
00:06:23,016 --> 00:06:24,243
Oh, are you engaged?

154
00:06:24,267 --> 00:06:25,845
Are you getting engaged? Uh, no.

155
00:06:25,869 --> 00:06:26,869
Uh, well, I...

156
00:06:26,936 --> 00:06:28,547
Her number's in that chart.

157
00:06:28,571 --> 00:06:30,549
I'll tell her to
expect your call.

158
00:06:30,573 --> 00:06:31,806
Okay.

159
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:38,330
Hey.

160
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,542
I think Grandma over there

161
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:41,433
just arranged my
marriage to her daughter.

162
00:06:43,102 --> 00:06:45,069
Well, there must be
something in the air,

163
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:47,789
because Amelia and Owen are
talking about getting married, too.

164
00:06:47,858 --> 00:06:49,685
Hey, maybe you guys
could have a double wedding.

165
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:51,643
Then I would only have
to live through it once.

166
00:06:51,712 --> 00:06:53,623
Help! Please! Someone
help! It's okay, buddy. I got you.

167
00:06:53,647 --> 00:06:55,008
Whoa. Okay, what happened?

168
00:06:55,032 --> 00:06:56,793
He passed out, he came to,
and then he passed out again.

169
00:06:56,817 --> 00:06:58,711
Okay, let's get him down here.
There's another kid outside.

170
00:06:58,735 --> 00:07:01,935
Is this your son, sir? Uh,
no. I'm his driver's ed teacher.

171
00:07:03,123 --> 00:07:04,623
Hey, I got it.

172
00:07:04,691 --> 00:07:07,075
Hey, there. You okay?

173
00:07:07,143 --> 00:07:09,223
Can I... Can I park here?

174
00:07:15,218 --> 00:07:18,719
Quit hovering and just
go in there and talk to him.

175
00:07:18,788 --> 00:07:21,200
He has made it very clear he
doesn't want me anywhere near him.

176
00:07:21,224 --> 00:07:23,758
So, no.

177
00:07:23,827 --> 00:07:26,256
Does she have him on
fluconazole in case it's fungal?

178
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,146
You do realize that
Kyle can see you?

179
00:07:28,214 --> 00:07:30,548
It's not one-way glass.

180
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:33,718
Thank you.

181
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,296
Kyle?

182
00:07:45,365 --> 00:07:46,675
Oh, God. I'm fine.

183
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:47,777
Are you okay?

184
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:48,845
I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine.

185
00:07:48,869 --> 00:07:50,901
I'm fine.

186
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:54,789
Everything just
started spinning.

187
00:07:54,857 --> 00:07:59,527
The... The nausea's probably
because of the antibiotics.

188
00:07:59,595 --> 00:08:02,931
Uh, I'll get Dr. Shepherd
to get you an antiemetic.

189
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:11,556
Why don't you just go?

190
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:13,958
Take that.

191
00:08:27,474 --> 00:08:29,241
I don't need any help.

192
00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:31,959
And I definitely don't
want an audience for this.

193
00:08:32,028 --> 00:08:34,529
Then, um, let's pretend that

194
00:08:34,598 --> 00:08:35,975
you're puking for some
other reason, then.

195
00:08:35,999 --> 00:08:39,200
Aah. Like, um, after
a show or something.

196
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:41,185
Too many whiskey
shots, you know?

197
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:42,965
Fun puking. You're
not hearing me.

198
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:45,924
I don't need any help from you.

199
00:08:45,993 --> 00:08:48,593
Look, I understand if you
don't want to deal with me,

200
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:50,128
but you are gonna need somebody.

201
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:53,064
Does your friends, do your
family know that you're here?

202
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:55,662
That's none of your
business, all right?

203
00:08:55,686 --> 00:08:57,785
I'm not your business anymore.

204
00:08:57,854 --> 00:08:59,887
Okay.

205
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:01,806
But you're gonna need someone.

206
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,808
Dr. Shepherd took
out your implant.

207
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:05,910
Your tremor is gonna come back.

208
00:09:08,815 --> 00:09:10,055
No kidding.

209
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:14,602
Kyle, I'm sorry.

210
00:09:14,671 --> 00:09:17,705
I'm gonna puke again, now.

211
00:09:21,511 --> 00:09:22,894
How about you just go?

212
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:27,332
Go. Go!

213
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:28,401
I'm...

214
00:09:28,468 --> 00:09:29,667
I'm going.

215
00:09:48,655 --> 00:09:50,855
Dad, Dad, I may have
brushed against the wall, but...

216
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:53,024
Good news, Arvin. I
see no signs of anything.

217
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:54,137
You're doing just fine.

218
00:09:54,161 --> 00:09:56,077
And the doctor says I'm fine.

219
00:09:56,146 --> 00:09:58,013
Yeah. The doctor.

220
00:09:58,081 --> 00:10:00,465
Well, it... It was the
wall of a hospital,

221
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:01,883
but didn't I say that?

222
00:10:01,951 --> 00:10:03,262
Tell him that Rhys had
a medical emergency.

223
00:10:03,286 --> 00:10:04,747
It's strep throat. That's
not an emergency.

224
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:06,366
Strep throat shouldn't
cause you to faint.

225
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:07,522
Are you on antibiotics?

226
00:10:07,591 --> 00:10:09,590
Yeah, for two days. I'm fine.

227
00:10:09,659 --> 00:10:11,509
But, still, open up.

228
00:10:11,577 --> 00:10:13,177
You passed out in a car.

229
00:10:13,246 --> 00:10:14,573
You know how dangerous
that is on the road?

230
00:10:14,597 --> 00:10:16,242
I wasn't even
driving! It was Arvin!

231
00:10:16,266 --> 00:10:17,576
Has he passed out
before? I don't know.

232
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,644
His mother would kill me

233
00:10:18,668 --> 00:10:19,745
if I let something
happen to him.

234
00:10:19,769 --> 00:10:21,097
Please don't talk about her.

235
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:22,582
It looks like Rhys has
a peritonsillar abscess.

236
00:10:22,606 --> 00:10:23,606
I do need to drain it.

237
00:10:24,107 --> 00:10:25,318
Oh, no, no,

238
00:10:25,342 --> 00:10:26,552
you're not sticking that
thing down my throat.

239
00:10:26,576 --> 00:10:27,637
Hey, hey, Rhys,
buddy, it's okay.

240
00:10:27,661 --> 00:10:29,393
I'm here. All right?

241
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:30,756
It's like I told you, I want
you to think of me as a father.

242
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:32,491
Why? All my mom ever talks about

243
00:10:32,515 --> 00:10:33,742
is when she's gonna
break up with you.

244
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:34,811
What? ARVIN: Hold on. Hold on.

245
00:10:34,835 --> 00:10:38,153
Your mom's doing
our driver's ed teacher?

246
00:10:40,006 --> 00:10:41,367
I came as soon as
I got the message.

247
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:42,869
Rhys, honey, are you
okay? Yeah, I'm fine.

248
00:10:42,893 --> 00:10:44,103
No, he's not okay,
and neither am I.

249
00:10:44,127 --> 00:10:45,571
You told him that you
want to break up with me?

250
00:10:45,595 --> 00:10:47,439
Is that true? You told him?

251
00:10:47,463 --> 00:10:49,613
Ah...

252
00:10:49,683 --> 00:10:51,694
This is way better than
our last driver's ed class.

253
00:10:51,718 --> 00:10:54,001
Ready? Here we go.

254
00:10:57,224 --> 00:10:58,506
Oh.

255
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:02,944
Be nice. I know.

256
00:11:03,012 --> 00:11:04,807
But, God, she put
me through hell.

257
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,580
I know, and you won.

258
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:08,215
You can afford to
be magnanimous.

259
00:11:08,285 --> 00:11:09,362
Hey, guys.

260
00:11:09,386 --> 00:11:11,685
Well, I was wondering if, um...

261
00:11:11,755 --> 00:11:13,850
I've had a surgery
come up later this week,

262
00:11:13,874 --> 00:11:15,373
and so I wanted to ask

263
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:17,641
if I could please have
Sofia Tuesday night

264
00:11:17,711 --> 00:11:18,951
instead of Thursday.

265
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:20,277
Um...

266
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:23,882
So if I allow you to
have Sofia on Tuesday,

267
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:26,734
then in exchange, I
will have her Friday?

268
00:11:26,803 --> 00:11:28,614
Yeah, sure, if
that's what you want.

269
00:11:28,638 --> 00:11:30,616
Great. Okay, then I
will make that work.

270
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,206
Thank you.

271
00:11:33,476 --> 00:11:35,026
She's gone. Hmm?

272
00:11:35,095 --> 00:11:38,129
I'd lose that crazed smile
before you start cramping.

273
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:39,330
Yeah.

274
00:11:40,951 --> 00:11:43,584
I am concerned about Kyle.

275
00:11:43,653 --> 00:11:45,031
You know, he's still septic.

276
00:11:45,055 --> 00:11:46,632
His cultures are
showing possible fungus.

277
00:11:46,656 --> 00:11:48,296
He's also complaining
of neck stiffness.

278
00:11:48,358 --> 00:11:50,219
Why are you talking
to me about this?

279
00:11:50,243 --> 00:11:51,504
You operated three days ago.

280
00:11:51,528 --> 00:11:53,072
Why isn't he recovering?
No. You are off this case.

281
00:11:53,096 --> 00:11:54,740
You are not on my service today.

282
00:11:54,764 --> 00:11:56,609
Why are you talking
to me about this?

283
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:58,533
Are you sure the infection

284
00:11:58,602 --> 00:12:01,002
isn't because of the
second lead you placed,

285
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:02,648
the one you had to
convince us to get?

286
00:12:02,672 --> 00:12:05,022
Him. The one I
convinced him to get

287
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:07,592
because he is my
patient, not you.

288
00:12:07,661 --> 00:12:08,927
I am just concerned.

289
00:12:08,995 --> 00:12:10,795
And if you were
the patient's family,

290
00:12:10,864 --> 00:12:12,358
I would want to
assuage those concerns,

291
00:12:12,382 --> 00:12:14,582
but you are neither
family nor friend right now.

292
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:16,468
He developed a complication.

293
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,820
Complications happen, Edwards.

294
00:12:18,889 --> 00:12:21,489
We deal with them every
day. Today is no different.

295
00:12:24,227 --> 00:12:26,460
White count is trending
down, wound is clean,

296
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:28,341
but his temp is
still a little high.

297
00:12:28,365 --> 00:12:29,759
Hey, Kyle, how you feeling?

298
00:12:29,783 --> 00:12:31,582
I was good until
these two showed up.

299
00:12:31,651 --> 00:12:33,896
It's been nag city
for the last half-hour.

300
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,898
Well, maybe you should
think about that the next time

301
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:37,984
you're in the hospital for
three days without calling us.

302
00:12:38,008 --> 00:12:40,941
I went through 19 hours of
labor with you, without drugs.

303
00:12:41,011 --> 00:12:43,177
You owe me at least
a text or a "tweep."

304
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:45,074
Mom, it's a tweet,
for the 10th time.

305
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:47,960
Are you Dr. Shepherd?
I am, yeah.

306
00:12:47,984 --> 00:12:50,368
Dr. Shepherd recently
removed the infected device

307
00:12:50,437 --> 00:12:52,198
from Kyle's brain, but
you should be aware

308
00:12:52,222 --> 00:12:54,132
that both the surgery
and the antibiotics

309
00:12:54,156 --> 00:12:55,551
aren't working as
well as we expected.

310
00:12:55,575 --> 00:12:56,619
I'm sorry. Who are you?

311
00:12:56,643 --> 00:12:57,686
I'm Dr. Edwards.

312
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:58,888
I'm one of the surgeons here.

313
00:12:58,912 --> 00:13:00,027
This is her?

314
00:13:00,981 --> 00:13:01,981
This is her.

315
00:13:02,048 --> 00:13:03,064
You can go.

316
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:04,260
Kyle, if we could just talk...

317
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:05,711
Why is she even
here? I want her to go.

318
00:13:05,735 --> 00:13:07,597
Mmm-hmm. My son is
not good enough for her.

319
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:08,931
She's not good enough for us.

320
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:10,282
My brother's broken
a lot of hearts,

321
00:13:10,306 --> 00:13:11,851
but I've never seen
anyone break his.

322
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:12,907
And I got to think

323
00:13:12,976 --> 00:13:14,086
he'd be better off
if he'd come in here

324
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:15,860
sooner instead of
trying to avoid you.

325
00:13:15,912 --> 00:13:17,356
So, please, do my family a favor

326
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,047
and get the hell out of here.

327
00:13:19,115 --> 00:13:21,449
Thank you, Dr. Edwards.
That will be all.

328
00:13:28,675 --> 00:13:30,708
So, it's a basic
decortication procedure,

329
00:13:30,777 --> 00:13:32,577
except there is a
slight abnormality.

330
00:13:32,646 --> 00:13:35,180
Yeah, sorry, I can't take
your decortication procedure

331
00:13:35,248 --> 00:13:37,560
'cause I already took
it. Just did the consult.

332
00:13:37,584 --> 00:13:39,295
You just took my
patient without telling me?

333
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:40,696
You've been pawning
decortications off

334
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,019
on me since I got here.

335
00:13:42,088 --> 00:13:43,299
You hate them, so
now I just take them,

336
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:44,900
and you don't have to pawn.

337
00:13:44,924 --> 00:13:46,391
Thank you.

338
00:13:46,459 --> 00:13:48,125
Bacon?

339
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:49,271
Is that a box of bacon?

340
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:50,528
Bacon. Mmm-hmm.

341
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,091
A cardiothoracic hand grenade.

342
00:13:52,115 --> 00:13:53,759
You know you're a doctor, right?

343
00:13:53,783 --> 00:13:55,703
Mmm. Mmm-hmm. A heart doctor.

344
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:01,484
It is good.

345
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:03,188
Told you. Mmm-hmm.

346
00:14:06,913 --> 00:14:07,957
It's my job, isn't it?

347
00:14:07,981 --> 00:14:09,221
You got the big, fancy job,

348
00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:10,810
and you have no
respect for mine.

349
00:14:10,834 --> 00:14:11,398
Are you trying to
tell me that your life's

350
00:14:11,467 --> 00:14:12,478
ambitions stopped

351
00:14:12,502 --> 00:14:13,651
after driver's ed teacher?

352
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:14,830
Do you know how many hours

353
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,365
the average American
spends behind the wheel...

354
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:17,188
Oh, here we go. How
many accidents there are

355
00:14:17,257 --> 00:14:18,539
every day?

356
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:20,036
I am shaping the
drivers of the future.

357
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:22,037
I'm saving lives!
I'm a freaking hero!

358
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:23,906
Okay, Superman. We get it,
okay? Hands at 10:00 and 2:00.

359
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:25,875
Yeah, except the recommended
placement is 9:00 and 3:00 now.

360
00:14:25,899 --> 00:14:27,710
9:00 and 3:00! See these two?

361
00:14:27,734 --> 00:14:29,145
You and Wilson
are doing it right,

362
00:14:29,169 --> 00:14:30,296
not rushing into things.

363
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,320
"Rushing into things"?

364
00:14:31,387 --> 00:14:32,665
We've been together
a million years.

365
00:14:32,689 --> 00:14:34,171
Dr. Karev? Dr. Grey?

366
00:14:34,241 --> 00:14:35,650
Had to put the screws
to the X-ray tech,

367
00:14:35,674 --> 00:14:37,124
but I got him to
rush Rhys' films.

368
00:14:37,193 --> 00:14:38,454
Is that air around the trachea?

369
00:14:38,478 --> 00:14:39,678
I hope not.

370
00:14:39,746 --> 00:14:41,607
It could be artifact,
but we need a CT.

371
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:43,075
You're really great.
You're... You're clean, but...

372
00:14:43,099 --> 00:14:45,444
Who's interrupting the happy
couple to let Mom know?

373
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:47,212
I don't know. I was
thinking right about now.

374
00:14:47,236 --> 00:14:48,581
Yeah, well, maybe
I am, too. Oh, great.

375
00:14:48,605 --> 00:14:49,699
So now you're gonna
break up with me?

376
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:50,888
This is fantastic.

377
00:14:53,209 --> 00:14:54,759
Have fun.

378
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:56,127
I never said that.

379
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:57,806
You've been treating me like...

380
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:03,334
Jo, look, I need to know
what is going on with Kyle.

381
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:04,751
Just tell me.

382
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,415
Shepherd would kill me.
His family would kill me.

383
00:15:06,439 --> 00:15:08,072
Jo, please. Come on.

384
00:15:08,141 --> 00:15:10,469
You have, what, four floors
to tell me everything you know.

385
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:12,877
Please. What is going on?

386
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:15,780
Okay, his symptoms
aren't getting any better.

387
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:18,248
He's febrile with some
headaches, a bit lethargic,

388
00:15:18,317 --> 00:15:20,951
and Shepherd ordered a stat CT

389
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:23,820
that showed evidence of an
abscess in the periventricular area.

390
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:27,608
Okay. Uh...

391
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:30,077
So what is Shepherd's plan?

392
00:15:30,146 --> 00:15:32,191
Drainage and
ventricular washout.

393
00:15:32,215 --> 00:15:35,183
No. No. What?

394
00:15:35,251 --> 00:15:36,650
She wouldn't do that.

395
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,997
She knows how
dangerous that can be.

396
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:42,490
She... She can't.

397
00:15:42,558 --> 00:15:45,554
I'm sorry. I have a ton
of prep before surgery.

398
00:15:45,578 --> 00:15:48,045
Does... Does he know
how dangerous it can be?

399
00:15:53,486 --> 00:15:55,398
Big wedding or small wedding?

400
00:15:55,422 --> 00:15:57,400
Well, not too small.

401
00:15:57,424 --> 00:15:59,268
You want it to be a party.

402
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:01,759
So, um, kids?

403
00:16:01,828 --> 00:16:02,860
Five.

404
00:16:02,929 --> 00:16:04,128
Whoa, five?

405
00:16:04,197 --> 00:16:05,997
Sure.

406
00:16:06,066 --> 00:16:07,565
Unless the first
few terrorize us.

407
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:08,766
Then we can have four.

408
00:16:11,237 --> 00:16:14,472
Are we really
talking about this?

409
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,540
Marriage and kids?

410
00:16:16,609 --> 00:16:18,476
No.

411
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:24,548
I mean, maybe one day, but no.

412
00:16:24,617 --> 00:16:26,929
It was pretty fun watching
Maggie's face in the OR, though.

413
00:16:26,953 --> 00:16:28,297
Yep.

414
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:32,357
You know, it is fun
being fake married to you.

415
00:16:32,425 --> 00:16:34,792
Well, it's fun being
fake married to you.

416
00:16:38,965 --> 00:16:40,264
Mmm. Mmm-hmm.

417
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,633
I have... I have to
prep for a surgery.

418
00:16:42,702 --> 00:16:44,102
Bye-bye.

419
00:16:50,944 --> 00:16:52,822
Uh, Knox asked
me to cover for him

420
00:16:52,846 --> 00:16:54,156
on that facial implant tomorrow.

421
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,291
Cool with you?

422
00:16:55,315 --> 00:16:57,215
Yeah, of course.

423
00:16:57,283 --> 00:16:59,683
Hey, look, if you
need a place to crash,

424
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:02,086
I still owe you and
I still have a sofa.

425
00:17:02,155 --> 00:17:03,866
Here you go. Why
would I need your sofa?

426
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:06,224
Everything okay
between you and Bailey?

427
00:17:06,292 --> 00:17:07,374
Yeah. Fine.

428
00:17:07,444 --> 00:17:08,854
No, you're still living
in the same house,

429
00:17:08,878 --> 00:17:10,373
but you're not talking
to each other, right?

430
00:17:10,397 --> 00:17:11,562
I'm aware.

431
00:17:11,614 --> 00:17:13,481
Counseling?

432
00:17:13,549 --> 00:17:16,283
Well, if we go to counseling,
then we'll have to talk,

433
00:17:16,352 --> 00:17:18,753
and then we'll yell,
so not talking is better.

434
00:17:18,822 --> 00:17:19,932
So, then what are you gonna do?

435
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:21,434
Do? Well, yeah.

436
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:22,802
You can't just stay like this.

437
00:17:22,826 --> 00:17:24,057
Oh, I can stay like this.

438
00:17:24,127 --> 00:17:27,811
And I will. I am a
very patient man.

439
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,091
And I am right, which makes me

440
00:17:29,115 --> 00:17:32,232
even more patient
since she is overreacting.

441
00:17:32,302 --> 00:17:34,647
I know it and she knows it, though
she's not ready to admit it yet.

442
00:17:34,671 --> 00:17:37,588
So I am biding my time
until she apologizes,

443
00:17:37,657 --> 00:17:39,273
at which point I
will haul my ass

444
00:17:39,342 --> 00:17:41,692
back into our bedroom
where it belongs.

445
00:17:41,761 --> 00:17:43,744
So... So you're not mad?

446
00:17:43,813 --> 00:17:45,546
Nah, man, I am pissed as hell,

447
00:17:45,615 --> 00:17:48,248
but she's the love
of my life, so...

448
00:17:48,318 --> 00:17:49,495
I mean, you get
it. You got April.

449
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:51,886
April and I are divorced.

450
00:17:51,954 --> 00:17:53,387
Well, like I said, waiting game.

451
00:17:53,455 --> 00:17:55,156
Stay strong. You'll get there.

452
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:56,886
You're out of your damn mind.

453
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:58,091
Yeah, I know.

454
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,882
Oh, hey, Bailey, I need to
talk to you about Warren.

455
00:18:04,951 --> 00:18:06,996
Oh, if this is
about that dinner...

456
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:09,498
No, it... It isn't. You
know, I'm just concerned.

457
00:18:09,522 --> 00:18:11,562
It's been a couple months now.

458
00:18:13,242 --> 00:18:16,243
We'll be fine. Look,
it's a waiting game.

459
00:18:16,312 --> 00:18:18,123
I'm right, and once he remembers

460
00:18:18,147 --> 00:18:19,742
that's always the
case, we'll be fine.

461
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:20,998
Well, good.

462
00:18:21,067 --> 00:18:22,945
And then maybe you would
consider reinstating him,

463
00:18:22,969 --> 00:18:24,651
sooner than later, okay?

464
00:18:24,721 --> 00:18:26,631
So when you said
you were concerned,

465
00:18:26,655 --> 00:18:28,701
you meant you were
concerned about you.

466
00:18:28,725 --> 00:18:30,457
Of course not.

467
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:33,327
Um, sir, after the many years I
served under you as my chief,

468
00:18:33,396 --> 00:18:36,330
you must understand
how difficult it is for me

469
00:18:36,399 --> 00:18:39,233
when you force me
to say, respectfully,

470
00:18:39,302 --> 00:18:40,902
this is not my problem

471
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:43,537
and, please, go
do your damn job.

472
00:18:44,924 --> 00:18:47,057
I don't think you
found that difficult at all.

473
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:56,362
I'll probably end up
hosting this wedding.

474
00:18:56,386 --> 00:18:58,063
I hosted Owen's last
wedding. Why not?

475
00:18:58,087 --> 00:18:59,887
What's it matter? Why
do you care so much?

476
00:18:59,956 --> 00:19:01,617
I just wanted Amelia to
keep busy with something.

477
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:03,007
You know, like a hobby.

478
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:04,436
'Cause if she's
talking Owen's ear off,

479
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:05,687
she can't talk off mine.

480
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:06,739
How does this change that?

481
00:19:06,763 --> 00:19:08,003
This means more talking.

482
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:10,342
Only now it'll be about
flowers and caterers

483
00:19:10,366 --> 00:19:11,744
and what kind of
dress I'm gonna wear.

484
00:19:11,768 --> 00:19:12,861
Kill me now.

485
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:14,079
Promise me you won't do this.

486
00:19:14,103 --> 00:19:15,413
What? If Jo ever pulls

487
00:19:15,437 --> 00:19:16,998
that ring out of that drawer,

488
00:19:17,022 --> 00:19:18,867
just go to Vegas.
Elope or something.

489
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:20,636
Don't put us through it all.

490
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,254
Oh, no.

491
00:19:22,278 --> 00:19:24,962
Air pockets in the
parapharyngeal space.

492
00:19:25,031 --> 00:19:27,264
Necrotizing fasciitis.

493
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:30,117
God, it's everywhere.
Mediastinum, the heart.

494
00:19:30,203 --> 00:19:32,303
There's no time. If it
spreads any further,

495
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:33,782
there won't be
anything left to salvage.

496
00:19:33,806 --> 00:19:35,840
I'm gonna take him
up to the OR right now.

497
00:19:35,909 --> 00:19:38,709
I'll page Jackson and cardio
and tell them to meet us up there.

498
00:19:40,796 --> 00:19:41,929
They paged cardio.

499
00:19:41,998 --> 00:19:43,263
You want it?

500
00:19:43,332 --> 00:19:44,943
I don't even know what "it" is.

501
00:19:44,967 --> 00:19:47,512
It's a kid with strep throat
turned into nec fasc in the chest.

502
00:19:47,536 --> 00:19:49,081
Pretty cool. Not for the kid.

503
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:51,425
No, for the kid, it sucks.
Does sound cool, though.

504
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:53,423
Flip you for it.

505
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:55,812
Is one of you gonna
get in here, or what?

506
00:19:57,763 --> 00:19:59,708
Uh, you know what?
You can have it.

507
00:19:59,732 --> 00:20:01,732
I mean, you have seniority.

508
00:20:02,168 --> 00:20:03,467
Yes.

509
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:04,980
So I don't have to go
in there if I don't want.

510
00:20:05,004 --> 00:20:06,454
Thought you wanted it.

511
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:09,089
This is an abuse of power.

512
00:20:09,158 --> 00:20:12,142
This is a delegation
of resources.

513
00:20:12,212 --> 00:20:13,722
You're a very valuable resource.

514
00:20:13,746 --> 00:20:15,095
Oh, don't you flatter me now.

515
00:20:15,164 --> 00:20:16,997
I have faith in you.

516
00:20:17,066 --> 00:20:18,398
Where Mer's concerned,

517
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:21,535
just, you know, give
as good as you get.

518
00:20:21,603 --> 00:20:22,686
I gave you bacon!

519
00:20:25,674 --> 00:20:28,275
You're taking Kyle in
for a ventricular washout?

520
00:20:28,344 --> 00:20:32,113
Hello, resident who is
not on my service today.

521
00:20:32,181 --> 00:20:34,915
There is an 85% mortality rate.

522
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:37,351
If his abscess ruptures
while he's on the table,

523
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:38,519
he dies immediately.

524
00:20:38,587 --> 00:20:39,999
Edwards, you are
really underfoot.

525
00:20:40,023 --> 00:20:42,689
Look, he just deserves
all the time he can get,

526
00:20:42,758 --> 00:20:46,293
not some Hail Mary.

527
00:20:46,362 --> 00:20:48,273
I mean, can you answer
me, please, Dr. Shepherd?

528
00:20:48,297 --> 00:20:49,337
Do you have this?

529
00:20:49,365 --> 00:20:51,115
Okay, no, I am
not answering that.

530
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:53,750
Not simply because
the patient and the family

531
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:56,636
have expressly asked you
not be involved in this case,

532
00:20:56,706 --> 00:20:57,905
which would be enough,

533
00:20:57,973 --> 00:21:00,374
but more because I
do not answer to you.

534
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:02,442
This is my surgical plan.

535
00:21:02,512 --> 00:21:04,812
I am confident in
my surgical plan.

536
00:21:04,881 --> 00:21:05,996
End of discussion.

537
00:21:07,667 --> 00:21:09,500
Wilson, what?

538
00:21:09,568 --> 00:21:12,970
I just wanted to let you know
the OR will be ready in 45 minutes.

539
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:14,088
Thank you.

540
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:17,991
For an average surgeon,

541
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:20,861
sure, a ventricular washout
could be a Hail Mary,

542
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:23,463
but, Edwards, this is me.

543
00:21:45,104 --> 00:21:48,271
Either come in or stay out, but
don't do whatever it is you're doing.

544
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:49,423
Okay.

545
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:54,561
I was thinking, uh...

546
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:58,565
Maybe I can postpone leaving,

547
00:21:58,634 --> 00:22:01,135
for just a little while,
just until things are better,

548
00:22:01,203 --> 00:22:03,337
until you and I
are... Are better.

549
00:22:03,406 --> 00:22:05,472
What's the point?

550
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:08,075
What? Two days? A week?

551
00:22:08,144 --> 00:22:09,421
We both know how this ends.

552
00:22:09,445 --> 00:22:10,761
No, I don't.

553
00:22:12,898 --> 00:22:15,966
But apparently you do, so
why don't you enlighten me?

554
00:22:16,035 --> 00:22:17,846
All right, look, we'll
drag this out. Sure.

555
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:20,081
You can wait here and things
will get superficially better,

556
00:22:20,105 --> 00:22:21,605
and then you'll leave,

557
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:24,941
and then we'll let things taper
off the way things taper off

558
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,250
over long distance,

559
00:22:26,311 --> 00:22:28,078
and then we'll be sorry,

560
00:22:28,146 --> 00:22:30,125
and we'll make
promises that are just lies.

561
00:22:30,149 --> 00:22:32,761
It's all a lie, because I'm
not leaving without Sofia,

562
00:22:32,785 --> 00:22:34,663
and you would never forgive
me if you gave up your grant,

563
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:36,119
so I'm stuck here, Penny.

564
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:39,428
I am stuck, and
there's no good solution.

565
00:22:41,394 --> 00:22:44,061
Callie, why won't
you look at me?

566
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:49,183
Are you breaking up with me?

567
00:22:49,252 --> 00:22:50,734
Is that it?

568
00:22:56,576 --> 00:22:58,896
Maybe instead of
dragging this out...

569
00:23:05,084 --> 00:23:07,324
Maybe we should
just call it now.

570
00:23:08,821 --> 00:23:11,741
Yeah, we should. You should go.

571
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:44,721
I told you to go.

572
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:47,091
And I'm really bad
at following directions.

573
00:23:59,404 --> 00:24:00,582
I hurt you.

574
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:01,621
You sure did.

575
00:24:01,691 --> 00:24:03,401
And I'm so sorry about that.

576
00:24:03,425 --> 00:24:05,993
Boy, my sister really hates you.

577
00:24:06,061 --> 00:24:07,410
Yeah.

578
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,957
Clearly, you told
her all about me.

579
00:24:08,981 --> 00:24:11,748
Well, to be fair, I told
her all the good stuff first.

580
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:15,019
I've missed you.

581
00:24:15,637 --> 00:24:17,137
Yeah?

582
00:24:17,206 --> 00:24:18,438
Well, relax.

583
00:24:18,507 --> 00:24:21,608
Like, I mean, not
like sad or, like,

584
00:24:21,677 --> 00:24:22,976
you know, love-sick miss you.

585
00:24:23,045 --> 00:24:25,329
I manly miss you.

586
00:24:25,397 --> 00:24:28,148
Like, I'm very tough.

587
00:24:28,217 --> 00:24:30,729
Look, I talked to Dr. Shepherd
about your surgery.

588
00:24:30,753 --> 00:24:32,820
And she's got this.

589
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:34,966
You're gonna make it
through this. I know it.

590
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:38,058
That's great, because
I look way hotter

591
00:24:38,127 --> 00:24:39,492
when I'm not in a hospital gown.

592
00:24:39,562 --> 00:24:41,761
Yeah, I remember.

593
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:47,067
So, what's our plan?

594
00:24:48,837 --> 00:24:50,621
With you and I
after all this is over?

595
00:24:50,689 --> 00:24:52,088
What?

596
00:24:52,141 --> 00:24:56,426
Yeah, when I'm well and
I'm done with this place,

597
00:24:56,496 --> 00:24:57,539
we should go away together.

598
00:24:57,563 --> 00:24:59,096
I can't go somewhere.

599
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:00,781
Come on. Have fun.

600
00:25:00,849 --> 00:25:02,394
Live a little. Okay. Like where?

601
00:25:02,418 --> 00:25:04,568
I have a bunch of
gigs lined up in Europe.

602
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:05,785
Mmm-hmm.

603
00:25:05,872 --> 00:25:07,399
Come on tour with
me for, like, a month.

604
00:25:07,423 --> 00:25:09,485
I'm a surgeon, not a groupie.

605
00:25:09,509 --> 00:25:10,769
Come on. You know
you want to see me play.

606
00:25:10,793 --> 00:25:12,025
I do, actually.

607
00:25:12,094 --> 00:25:13,171
But, you know,

608
00:25:13,195 --> 00:25:15,006
I'd probably just embarrass you,

609
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:16,375
acting a fool, you know,

610
00:25:16,399 --> 00:25:17,826
screaming your
name in the front row.

611
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:19,049
I'm excited to see that.

612
00:25:19,117 --> 00:25:20,367
No, you think you are.

613
00:25:20,436 --> 00:25:22,113
You have not seen
me act like a fool.

614
00:25:22,137 --> 00:25:23,332
I'd throw my bra on the stage.

615
00:25:23,356 --> 00:25:25,316
Please do that. Shut up.

616
00:25:36,252 --> 00:25:38,084
Listen...

617
00:25:38,153 --> 00:25:39,286
I, um...

618
00:25:43,559 --> 00:25:45,292
I am in this

619
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:48,145
kind of deep with you,

620
00:25:48,614 --> 00:25:50,497
so just

621
00:25:50,583 --> 00:25:54,318
don't say these things if
you don't mean them, okay?

622
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:55,652
Okay.

623
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,040
I have to take him to surgery.

624
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,814
Oh, yeah. Okay, it's
invaded the pleural space.

625
00:26:40,882 --> 00:26:41,981
Chest wall's involved.

626
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:43,161
We'll debride the top layer off.

627
00:26:43,185 --> 00:26:44,218
Go deeper.

628
00:26:44,286 --> 00:26:45,697
Get the pericardium
if you have to.

629
00:26:45,721 --> 00:26:47,616
I don't want to peel
this kid down to nothing.

630
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,917
And I don't want this
kid to have to go through

631
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:50,151
all this and still be infected.

632
00:26:50,175 --> 00:26:51,486
Go deeper! JACKSON:
Grey, come on.

633
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:53,471
Sorry. I've had enough
of bad decisions today.

634
00:26:53,495 --> 00:26:54,672
Yeah, well, what did I do?

635
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:56,256
Relax, mate. It's probably me.

636
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:58,293
No, she's just pissed that Shepherd
and Hunt are getting married.

637
00:26:58,317 --> 00:26:59,795
Really? JACKSON:
Oh, that's nice, actually.

638
00:26:59,819 --> 00:27:01,830
They're not. They
had a conversation.

639
00:27:01,854 --> 00:27:03,632
All right, so she's pissed about
them getting married someday.

640
00:27:03,656 --> 00:27:04,688
Why's that?

641
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:06,573
There's a kid on the table

642
00:27:06,642 --> 00:27:07,853
whose flesh is being eaten
alive right in front of us.

643
00:27:07,877 --> 00:27:09,321
Can we please just focus?

644
00:27:09,345 --> 00:27:11,156
Well, someone hand
me a half a cup of Drano,

645
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:13,580
I'll get it done in a jiffy.

646
00:27:13,648 --> 00:27:15,728
You think that's
funny? Little bit.

647
00:27:15,768 --> 00:27:17,168
I'm trying to say
we're well aware

648
00:27:17,235 --> 00:27:19,136
of who's on the table
and what the stakes are.

649
00:27:19,205 --> 00:27:20,598
We're all working
as fast as we can.

650
00:27:20,622 --> 00:27:22,489
We're all on the
same page, Grey.

651
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:23,635
You're not more interested

652
00:27:23,659 --> 00:27:24,987
in saving a life
than the rest of us.

653
00:27:25,011 --> 00:27:26,076
Mayo.

654
00:27:29,014 --> 00:27:30,974
Antibiotic irrigation.

655
00:27:34,203 --> 00:27:36,036
What'd you have?

656
00:27:36,105 --> 00:27:37,849
Young kid with
advanced nec fasc.

657
00:27:37,873 --> 00:27:39,684
I just hope I got it all.

658
00:27:39,708 --> 00:27:40,741
I hear you.

659
00:27:40,809 --> 00:27:42,020
I've got a ventricular washout

660
00:27:42,044 --> 00:27:43,744
on a massive brain abscess.

661
00:27:43,812 --> 00:27:45,262
Sounds last-ditch. Sorry.

662
00:27:45,331 --> 00:27:48,932
Well, not necessarily. I
feel pretty good about it.

663
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:50,066
Okay.

664
00:27:51,637 --> 00:27:53,470
I do.

665
00:27:53,539 --> 00:27:56,105
Well, you feel really good
about a lot of things, so...

666
00:27:56,175 --> 00:27:58,103
What does that mean? Nothing.

667
00:27:58,127 --> 00:28:00,047
Just... Just forget about it.

668
00:28:01,196 --> 00:28:03,046
Is it a problem for
you, Owen and me?

669
00:28:03,114 --> 00:28:04,659
Is that... Is that what
you're talking about?

670
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:06,194
Let's not. You have surgery.

671
00:28:06,218 --> 00:28:08,702
I can handle it. Can you?

672
00:28:08,771 --> 00:28:10,248
Because it seems
like... Like what?

673
00:28:10,272 --> 00:28:11,449
Like you don't even see it.

674
00:28:11,473 --> 00:28:13,318
You think you're
making all these choices

675
00:28:13,342 --> 00:28:16,004
and building this life when
none of this is actually yours.

676
00:28:16,028 --> 00:28:17,794
That doesn't even make sense.

677
00:28:17,846 --> 00:28:19,086
It does make sense.

678
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:20,925
You are living in my house,

679
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:24,284
helping to take care of
my children with my sister.

680
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:27,520
You are marrying
my best friend's ex.

681
00:28:27,589 --> 00:28:30,140
You are trying to
do my husband's job.

682
00:28:30,209 --> 00:28:34,611
You know, you used to have
humility, even a little anxiety.

683
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:37,147
And now you even
have his confidence.

684
00:28:37,216 --> 00:28:38,615
But why not?

685
00:28:38,684 --> 00:28:40,595
Because you've taken
over everything else.

686
00:28:40,619 --> 00:28:41,952
What are you saying?

687
00:28:42,004 --> 00:28:43,503
Get your own life.

688
00:28:43,589 --> 00:28:45,071
You have surgery.

689
00:28:57,970 --> 00:28:59,786
Noah, you really
don't have to stay here.

690
00:28:59,855 --> 00:29:02,066
Listen, this may all
be nothing to you,

691
00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:03,468
but it doesn't mean
that I don't care,

692
00:29:03,492 --> 00:29:05,053
okay, about you and the kid.

693
00:29:05,077 --> 00:29:06,304
I didn't say it was nothing.

694
00:29:06,328 --> 00:29:08,728
Oh, right, sorry. Sex.

695
00:29:08,797 --> 00:29:11,176
You were using
me for my stick shift.

696
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,100
Noah, for God's sake,
that is not what I said.

697
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:15,802
Excuse me. Hi.
We have an update.

698
00:29:15,871 --> 00:29:17,838
Okay. The surgery went well.

699
00:29:17,907 --> 00:29:20,523
We believe we were able to
resect all of the infected tissue.

700
00:29:20,593 --> 00:29:22,042
Rhys was very lucky.

701
00:29:22,128 --> 00:29:23,638
If you hadn't brought
him in when you did,

702
00:29:23,662 --> 00:29:25,339
we probably wouldn't
have been so successful.

703
00:29:25,363 --> 00:29:27,547
Oh, wow. Okay.

704
00:29:27,633 --> 00:29:29,311
Okay. It's okay.

705
00:29:29,335 --> 00:29:30,335
Thank you.

706
00:29:30,402 --> 00:29:31,801
He's gonna be okay.

707
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:33,353
He's here because of you.

708
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:36,823
He would've died, and he didn't

709
00:29:36,892 --> 00:29:39,025
because of you. Right?

710
00:29:39,111 --> 00:29:41,561
Yeah, kind of. Um, yeah.

711
00:29:42,481 --> 00:29:43,864
You are a hero.

712
00:29:43,933 --> 00:29:45,710
I mean, I just did what
needed to be done.

713
00:29:45,734 --> 00:29:46,734
No.

714
00:29:49,355 --> 00:29:50,355
Wow.

715
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:52,856
Okay.

716
00:29:52,925 --> 00:29:54,657
Well, good luck.

717
00:29:57,813 --> 00:30:00,847
See? Happy endings, they happen.

718
00:30:00,916 --> 00:30:03,483
Oh, please. Everyone's
in love in a foxhole.

719
00:30:03,552 --> 00:30:04,592
What?

720
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:05,719
He saved her kid.

721
00:30:05,788 --> 00:30:07,788
That's like post-traumatic
stress romance.

722
00:30:07,856 --> 00:30:09,367
You know what? Give it a rest.

723
00:30:09,391 --> 00:30:10,802
Just because you
choose to be unhappy

724
00:30:10,826 --> 00:30:11,936
doesn't mean
everybody else has to.

725
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,371
Not true. Not always a choice.

726
00:30:13,395 --> 00:30:14,722
You have chances, you know?

727
00:30:14,746 --> 00:30:16,913
You're hot, you're
smart, you're funny.

728
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:18,681
Maybe Thorpe didn't work out,

729
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:20,177
but that doesn't mean
you have to stop trying.

730
00:30:20,201 --> 00:30:21,379
And it sure as hell doesn't mean

731
00:30:21,403 --> 00:30:23,003
you get to crap
on everyone else.

732
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:25,555
And, yeah, I'm gonna
have a big wedding,

733
00:30:25,608 --> 00:30:26,740
and you're gonna be there

734
00:30:26,809 --> 00:30:28,119
'cause you're gonna
be my best man!

735
00:30:28,143 --> 00:30:29,509
Deal with it!

736
00:30:30,879 --> 00:30:32,179
Doctor.

737
00:30:38,019 --> 00:30:39,119
Hi.

738
00:30:39,855 --> 00:30:41,455
Um...

739
00:30:41,523 --> 00:30:44,457
Is there any way that I
could also have Sofia tonight?

740
00:30:44,543 --> 00:30:46,176
I know we already
moved things around,

741
00:30:46,245 --> 00:30:48,005
and thank you again
so much, by the way.

742
00:30:48,029 --> 00:30:49,789
It's just I really need to...

743
00:30:51,917 --> 00:30:54,128
Could I have her
tonight, please?

744
00:30:54,152 --> 00:30:56,285
It's just... It's
been a tough day.

745
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:58,138
You're right.

746
00:30:58,206 --> 00:30:59,517
We already did
move things around.

747
00:30:59,541 --> 00:31:02,426
Or rather, I already moved
things around for you.

748
00:31:02,494 --> 00:31:03,638
I know, and I thought that's why

749
00:31:03,662 --> 00:31:04,906
you would be
okay with letting...

750
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:06,241
With bending the rules
for your convenience?

751
00:31:06,265 --> 00:31:08,131
The rules that only exist

752
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:11,201
because you put us and all
of our friends through hell?

753
00:31:12,888 --> 00:31:14,755
No. I'm sorry. I just...

754
00:31:14,823 --> 00:31:16,590
You know, you chose this.

755
00:31:16,659 --> 00:31:19,325
You ruined everything.

756
00:31:19,394 --> 00:31:22,829
And yet you still expect me
to leap to fulfill your needs.

757
00:31:24,666 --> 00:31:26,633
I did that. I did
that this morning.

758
00:31:26,719 --> 00:31:28,768
Okay, Arizona, I
get it. You're angry.

759
00:31:29,471 --> 00:31:31,971
I wasn't angry.

760
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,640
I was gracious.

761
00:31:33,709 --> 00:31:36,192
I was nice and I
was accommodating

762
00:31:36,262 --> 00:31:38,161
and I tried to help you,

763
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:40,930
and yet here you are
again, asking for even more.

764
00:31:40,983 --> 00:31:42,182
I...

765
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:44,584
I do not have any
more to give you.

766
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:46,286
You have used
up all of my grace.

767
00:32:08,744 --> 00:32:09,854
Blake, what's wrong?

768
00:32:09,878 --> 00:32:11,978
Oh, Dr. Grey, I, um...

769
00:32:12,848 --> 00:32:14,113
I am gathering my things.

770
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:15,682
I'm leaving for the fellowship.

771
00:32:15,751 --> 00:32:17,517
Already? Mmm-hmm.

772
00:32:17,586 --> 00:32:20,870
My time line accelerated a bit.

773
00:32:25,377 --> 00:32:26,459
Callie and I broke up.

774
00:32:28,397 --> 00:32:30,513
I came here for her.

775
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,533
I stayed for her.

776
00:32:33,602 --> 00:32:35,168
I...

777
00:32:35,236 --> 00:32:36,703
Thought we were
gonna be together.

778
00:32:40,709 --> 00:32:43,777
Doesn't really
matter what I thought.

779
00:32:43,846 --> 00:32:46,946
We're over.

780
00:32:47,015 --> 00:32:49,449
We don't work anymore.

781
00:32:52,737 --> 00:32:54,937
Sorry. I had no idea.

782
00:32:55,007 --> 00:32:56,207
It's okay.

783
00:33:09,554 --> 00:33:11,254
You'll be okay, Blake.

784
00:33:15,861 --> 00:33:16,926
You will be okay.

785
00:33:16,996 --> 00:33:18,362
You will pick yourself up,

786
00:33:18,414 --> 00:33:20,730
and you will go kick
some fellowship ass.

787
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:21,814
Right?

788
00:33:22,634 --> 00:33:23,867
Thank you.

789
00:33:25,237 --> 00:33:27,770
For teaching me,
for... For everything.

790
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,356
It's my job.

791
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:37,348
50 cc syringe.

792
00:33:37,415 --> 00:33:39,249
Another one?

793
00:33:39,301 --> 00:33:41,621
There's more in there. Keep
irrigating until it clears out.

794
00:33:44,389 --> 00:33:45,939
No, no, no, no, no, no.

795
00:33:46,007 --> 00:33:47,507
What?

796
00:33:47,576 --> 00:33:48,458
There's too much fluid
coming out, and it's cloudy.

797
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:49,720
So the abscess is...

798
00:33:49,744 --> 00:33:51,021
It's ruptured into
his ventricles.

799
00:33:51,045 --> 00:33:52,089
Okay, then we just
need to move faster.

800
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:53,113
More irrigation!

801
00:33:53,181 --> 00:33:54,480
Keep the syringes coming fast!

802
00:33:59,888 --> 00:34:01,232
Damn it. It is getting harder

803
00:34:01,256 --> 00:34:02,600
to withdraw anything at all now.

804
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:04,052
His BP's starting to rise.

805
00:34:04,076 --> 00:34:05,819
Come on, Kyle. Come on.

806
00:34:09,248 --> 00:34:10,758
Stop. I need you
to stop irrigating

807
00:34:10,782 --> 00:34:12,193
and run up to the
gallery right now.

808
00:34:12,217 --> 00:34:13,884
What? Why?

809
00:34:13,952 --> 00:34:15,232
I don't want her watching this.

810
00:34:20,909 --> 00:34:22,570
I'm gonna try moving
the catheter around.

811
00:34:22,594 --> 00:34:23,855
He's getting bradycardic.

812
00:34:23,879 --> 00:34:25,195
Come on. Come on.

813
00:34:41,379 --> 00:34:42,379
Sorry.

814
00:35:04,485 --> 00:35:06,352
Steph, you shouldn't
be watching this.

815
00:35:06,421 --> 00:35:07,554
Oh, no.

816
00:35:24,973 --> 00:35:28,090
<i>Time of death, 15:23.</i>

817
00:35:44,476 --> 00:35:47,677
No! No! No!

818
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:52,982
No. No.

819
00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:00,890
Edwards.

820
00:36:00,959 --> 00:36:02,839
Stephanie, stop.

821
00:36:05,463 --> 00:36:07,458
We tried everything we could.

822
00:36:07,482 --> 00:36:10,882
His brain had already
infarcted from herniation.

823
00:36:12,204 --> 00:36:13,503
It was too far gone.

824
00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:17,668
I'm so sorry.

825
00:36:26,852 --> 00:36:28,629
And she's standing
there with these sad eyes

826
00:36:28,653 --> 00:36:29,752
like she's the victim.

827
00:36:29,821 --> 00:36:31,321
She's not the victim.

828
00:36:31,389 --> 00:36:33,201
Callie caused all this,
she set it all in motion,

829
00:36:33,225 --> 00:36:35,569
and now here we are and
there's not one part of it

830
00:36:35,593 --> 00:36:37,071
that doesn't suck, you know?

831
00:36:37,095 --> 00:36:38,539
Thank you. Yeah, I do.

832
00:36:38,563 --> 00:36:39,695
Good night, Robbins.

833
00:36:39,764 --> 00:36:41,630
Good night.

834
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:43,066
Jackson, hey.

835
00:36:43,134 --> 00:36:45,246
Uh, I e-mailed you the
video of the 3-D ultrasound.

836
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:46,619
Did you get it?

837
00:37:03,237 --> 00:37:04,370
You ready?

838
00:37:04,439 --> 00:37:05,521
Ready.

839
00:37:20,305 --> 00:37:22,772
There you are, baby.

840
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,841
I couldn't wait till
next week to see you.

841
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:26,876
I hope you don't mind.

842
00:37:29,414 --> 00:37:31,347
Thank God. Mmm.

843
00:37:38,323 --> 00:37:40,457
Did you catch the place on fire?

844
00:37:40,525 --> 00:37:44,094
I'm sorry. I was trying
to make us dinner.

845
00:37:44,162 --> 00:37:46,729
Should I order pizza or Thai?

846
00:37:52,087 --> 00:37:53,102
Jo, I'm ready.

847
00:37:53,171 --> 00:37:55,438
I know. I'm sorry.
I'm starving, too.

848
00:37:55,507 --> 00:37:57,585
No, I'm ready to get married.

849
00:37:57,609 --> 00:37:58,886
I have proposed to you twice,

850
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:00,855
and you still haven't
given me an answer.

851
00:38:00,879 --> 00:38:03,024
I bought you a ring, you
told me not to get rid of it,

852
00:38:03,048 --> 00:38:04,742
so it's just sitting in a
drawer, collecting dust.

853
00:38:04,766 --> 00:38:05,932
I know.

854
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,311
No, I'm ready to be married,

855
00:38:07,335 --> 00:38:09,703
and I need to know
when you will be ready.

856
00:38:09,771 --> 00:38:11,248
It doesn't have to
be today or tomorrow,

857
00:38:11,272 --> 00:38:12,967
but I need to know
it's gonna happen.

858
00:38:12,991 --> 00:38:15,536
I need to know that you're
up for this, 'cause I am.

859
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,954
Look, I'm not scared of
being committed to you.

860
00:38:16,978 --> 00:38:19,338
I want to be married to you.

861
00:38:20,499 --> 00:38:23,939
But I'm done waiting. So I just
need to know, will you marry me?

862
00:38:24,002 --> 00:38:26,036
Oh, God. Okay. Okay.

863
00:38:29,141 --> 00:38:30,206
I...

864
00:38:33,378 --> 00:38:34,811
Alex, I can't.

865
00:38:35,797 --> 00:38:37,663
Of course you can.

866
00:38:39,534 --> 00:38:42,034
Alex... I don't
need a big thing.

867
00:38:42,103 --> 00:38:43,223
I just need you.

868
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:47,256
I'm so sorry, but...

869
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:51,010
No.

870
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:52,812
<i>You know that thing?</i>

871
00:38:52,881 --> 00:38:55,192
<i>That terrible thing you
thought you had laid to rest?</i>

872
00:38:55,216 --> 00:38:56,256
<i>What if you didn't?</i>

873
00:38:56,284 --> 00:38:57,617
Well?

874
00:38:57,685 --> 00:38:58,718
It's great.

875
00:38:58,787 --> 00:39:00,253
Owen, it's really great.

876
00:39:00,322 --> 00:39:01,470
Wait till you see inside.

877
00:39:06,461 --> 00:39:07,994
What's wrong? What's wrong?

878
00:39:09,497 --> 00:39:11,781
My patient died today.

879
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:13,232
Oh, I'm sorry.

880
00:39:13,301 --> 00:39:17,604
I thought I knew what I
was doing, but he still died.

881
00:39:17,672 --> 00:39:20,273
I thought I knew
what I was doing.

882
00:39:25,046 --> 00:39:29,415
You and I... We're good, right?

883
00:39:29,484 --> 00:39:33,085
I mean, this is real between us.

884
00:39:34,389 --> 00:39:35,629
We know what we're doing.

885
00:39:36,974 --> 00:39:38,207
I think we do.

886
00:39:40,195 --> 00:39:41,711
Why aren't we doing it?

887
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:43,341
Why aren't we building our life?

888
00:39:43,365 --> 00:39:45,225
I don't want to waste our time

889
00:39:45,249 --> 00:39:49,251
on conversations or some
hypothetical lives someday.

890
00:39:49,304 --> 00:39:50,369
I...

891
00:39:52,107 --> 00:39:53,807
I want a real life...

892
00:39:55,410 --> 00:39:56,650
And I want it with you.

893
00:39:59,447 --> 00:40:00,763
Are you asking me to marry you?

894
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:03,650
Yes.

895
00:40:03,718 --> 00:40:04,895
We're not talking
about the fake married.

896
00:40:04,919 --> 00:40:06,439
We're talking about
the real married.

897
00:40:06,938 --> 00:40:09,572
Real, Owen.

898
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:13,175
Completely real.

899
00:40:17,381 --> 00:40:19,999
Will you marry me?

900
00:40:20,067 --> 00:40:25,505
<i>You know that thing you
think you finally figured out?</i>

901
00:40:26,391 --> 00:40:27,940
<i>What if you haven't?</i>

902
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:35,832
I didn't mean to startle you.

903
00:40:38,052 --> 00:40:39,652
Hell of a save today.

904
00:40:39,721 --> 00:40:40,953
Thank you.

905
00:40:42,223 --> 00:40:43,523
Night. Night.

906
00:40:43,591 --> 00:40:44,668
Hope you feel better.

907
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:46,559
I feel fine. Yeah, right.

908
00:40:46,628 --> 00:40:47,693
What did you say?

909
00:40:47,762 --> 00:40:49,445
Nothing. Forget it.

910
00:40:49,514 --> 00:40:50,613
What did you say?

911
00:40:55,153 --> 00:40:57,434
You turned that OR
into a minefield today.

912
00:40:57,471 --> 00:40:59,005
Everybody felt it. And?

913
00:40:59,073 --> 00:41:00,606
I mean, I see why you're pissed.

914
00:41:00,674 --> 00:41:01,754
I would be, too, I bet.

915
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:03,876
She's your sister, right?

916
00:41:03,945 --> 00:41:05,878
Who? Your dead husband.

917
00:41:05,947 --> 00:41:07,763
Don't talk about him.

918
00:41:07,832 --> 00:41:09,409
Amelia Shepherd's his sister,
you had this great thing with him,

919
00:41:09,433 --> 00:41:11,078
now he's gone and she's here,

920
00:41:11,102 --> 00:41:14,220
and she gets to get
all the good stuff, right?

921
00:41:14,289 --> 00:41:16,389
With Hunt, of all people.

922
00:41:16,458 --> 00:41:18,185
Everyone else is
so happy about it,

923
00:41:18,209 --> 00:41:21,744
and all it does is make you
want to punch her in the face.

924
00:41:23,582 --> 00:41:24,608
Am I close?

925
00:41:24,632 --> 00:41:26,093
I can see why Owen hates you.

926
00:41:26,117 --> 00:41:28,529
Hey, I'm trying to be nice
here, empathize a little.

927
00:41:28,553 --> 00:41:29,652
We both lost people.

928
00:41:29,721 --> 00:41:31,404
That doesn't mean we
belong to some club.

929
00:41:31,473 --> 00:41:32,533
Now, that's just mean.

930
00:41:32,557 --> 00:41:33,784
So? So don't be like that.

931
00:41:33,808 --> 00:41:37,660
I should be like you?
Laid-back and cool?

932
00:41:37,729 --> 00:41:40,179
Can anyone ever
get a rise out of you?

933
00:41:40,248 --> 00:41:41,968
People have, yeah.
Like who? Owen?

934
00:41:42,033 --> 00:41:43,093
All right, don't bring him up.

935
00:41:43,117 --> 00:41:44,478
You brought up my dead husband.

936
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:45,796
Yeah, to be nice.
Well, don't be nice.

937
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:47,715
Well, don't be mean.
I'll do whatever I want!

938
00:41:47,739 --> 00:41:49,066
Yeah? Well, so will I! Me, too.

939
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:50,623
Well, what do you want?

940
00:41:50,691 --> 00:41:53,609
<i>When do you know you've
put something to bed?</i>

941
00:41:53,678 --> 00:41:55,561
<i>When is it finally
safe to move on?</i>

942
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:56,946
<i>Maybe you never know.</i>

943
00:41:56,998 --> 00:42:00,216
<i>Maybe you just
have to test the water.</i>

944
00:42:00,268 --> 00:42:02,368
<i>You have to see how it feels.</i>

945
00:42:02,436 --> 00:42:03,981
Okay, this could
make things a little...

946
00:42:04,005 --> 00:42:05,171
Just shut up.

947
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:08,558
<i>And if it feels good,
I mean, really good,</i>

948
00:42:08,627 --> 00:42:12,411
<i>then, hell, I say go for it.</i>
