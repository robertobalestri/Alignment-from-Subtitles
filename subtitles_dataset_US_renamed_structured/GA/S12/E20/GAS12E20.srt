00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:03,496
<i>Previously on</i> Grey's Anatomy...

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,181
Kyle Diaz, diagnosed
with relapsing

3
00:00:05,205 --> 00:00:06,883
and remitting
multiple sclerosis.

4
00:00:06,907 --> 00:00:08,907
You and I are a lot alike.

5
00:00:08,976 --> 00:00:10,387
I told him maybe we would go
out when he got back from touring,

6
00:00:10,411 --> 00:00:11,638
and so we've been texting.

7
00:00:11,662 --> 00:00:13,278
Oh. Guitar Hero?

8
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:16,025
If Jackson can make a case
that April committed fraud,

9
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:18,333
he's got a shot at getting
full custody of that baby.

10
00:00:18,401 --> 00:00:19,663
I think Jackson's gonna sue me.

11
00:00:19,687 --> 00:00:21,281
I tried to take the high road.

12
00:00:21,305 --> 00:00:22,616
Apparently, the high road is
paved with restraining orders.

13
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,439
The restraining
order was a mistake.

14
00:00:24,508 --> 00:00:26,003
You were my best friend, April.

15
00:00:26,027 --> 00:00:28,427
We should treat each other
the way we did on this paper.

16
00:00:28,496 --> 00:00:29,772
Bailey gave me the
Preminger Grant.

17
00:00:29,796 --> 00:00:31,296
I'm gonna be
miserable without you.

18
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:33,326
You can figure it out.
You will. You... You should.

19
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:34,450
I can totally go with her.

20
00:00:34,518 --> 00:00:36,012
<i>You'll be able to see
Sofia whenever you want.</i>

21
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:37,330
My ex-wife wants to move across

22
00:00:37,354 --> 00:00:38,598
the country and
take our daughter.

23
00:00:38,622 --> 00:00:41,306
It's a six-month suspension
from the residency program.

24
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:43,120
I tried to save her.
They know that, right?

25
00:00:43,144 --> 00:00:45,272
<i>I wanted to fire you!
I was talked down!</i>

26
00:00:45,296 --> 00:00:47,663
Well, I am sorry
I disappoint you.

27
00:00:47,748 --> 00:00:49,564
That's all, Dr. Warren.

28
00:00:58,776 --> 00:01:01,843
<i>Surgeons are often evaluated
on speed and efficiency.</i>

29
00:01:01,912 --> 00:01:03,356
Did you brush all of them? Yes.

30
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:04,479
Let me see.

31
00:01:04,548 --> 00:01:06,476
<i>But that doesn't mean
faster is always better.</i>

32
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,416
Good girl. Keep brushing.

33
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:09,846
Maggie, where's... Yeah.

34
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:11,136
We're here. Found them.

35
00:01:12,089 --> 00:01:13,288
Where?

36
00:01:13,356 --> 00:01:15,456
They were under my pillow.

37
00:01:15,525 --> 00:01:17,771
Someone crawled into
bed with me last night.

38
00:01:17,795 --> 00:01:19,422
Who's crawling into whose
bed? Is DeLuca here?

39
00:01:19,446 --> 00:01:20,678
Ha! Definitely not.

40
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:22,881
It's the wrong foot. Aw!

41
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:25,645
<i>You jump the gun, you risk
making a wrong diagnosis.</i>

42
00:01:25,669 --> 00:01:27,497
You know, we're
becoming like cat ladies,

43
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:28,870
and the children are our cats.

44
00:01:28,939 --> 00:01:30,633
I'm not a cat lady just
because I stopped having...

45
00:01:30,657 --> 00:01:32,207
Read the room. Yeah.

46
00:01:32,275 --> 00:01:34,259
S-E-X with DeLuca.

47
00:01:34,328 --> 00:01:36,723
<i>We don't always have the
time to think before we act.</i>

48
00:01:36,747 --> 00:01:38,157
Hey, Mommy. Yes?

49
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:42,250
Why did Aunt Maggie stop
having S-E-X with DeLuca?

50
00:01:45,189 --> 00:01:48,573
Because he couldn't handle
that she was his B-O-S-S.

51
00:01:48,642 --> 00:01:51,727
Do not ever date a man who
can't handle your P-O-W-E-R.

52
00:01:51,795 --> 00:01:53,011
Okay.

53
00:01:53,063 --> 00:01:55,013
They just pick up everything.

54
00:01:55,065 --> 00:01:56,492
Got 'em all. Good job.

55
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:58,650
<i>And that's what
gets us in trouble.</i>

56
00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:00,197
I can't stand it, you know.

57
00:02:00,221 --> 00:02:01,531
I mean, the other day, I
was sitting in a coffee place,

58
00:02:01,555 --> 00:02:03,066
and I thought, "Huh.
I can be a barista."

59
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:04,634
Why not?

60
00:02:04,658 --> 00:02:05,702
I was an
anesthesiologist for years.

61
00:02:05,726 --> 00:02:07,370
Now I just wake
people up for a living.

62
00:02:07,394 --> 00:02:09,661
Feels like a less-than-lateral
move, don't you think?

63
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:12,113
Well, I got to do something.
I'm going stir crazy.

64
00:02:12,182 --> 00:02:15,350
I'm falling so far behind,
I'm losing so much OR time...

65
00:02:15,419 --> 00:02:17,096
You have more experience
than any of the other residents.

66
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,348
Don't panic. You're
already ahead.

67
00:02:18,372 --> 00:02:20,021
It's funny, actually.

68
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:22,524
You've been a doctor
longer than any of them.

69
00:02:22,593 --> 00:02:24,209
Been a doctor longer than me.

70
00:02:24,261 --> 00:02:26,227
How is that funny?

71
00:02:26,296 --> 00:02:27,462
It's not.

72
00:02:27,531 --> 00:02:29,197
Yeah, it's really not.

73
00:02:29,266 --> 00:02:31,728
God, that coffee sounds
really good right now, doesn't it?

74
00:02:31,752 --> 00:02:33,468
Yeah.

75
00:02:35,538 --> 00:02:37,050
Oh, hey. WOMAN: Hey, yes.

76
00:02:37,074 --> 00:02:38,184
Did you see what
happened in the paper?

77
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:39,318
No. But you were right about it.

78
00:02:39,342 --> 00:02:40,976
Hi. Sorry. I'm here, I'm here.

79
00:02:41,044 --> 00:02:43,344
No, no, no, no. Hey,
did you want to order?

80
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:44,925
No, I'm good. And you
have a consult, right?

81
00:02:44,949 --> 00:02:46,726
Yeah, I do. Yeah. Yeah,
so we should probably just...

82
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,050
Yeah. No. Well, how's it going?

83
00:02:48,118 --> 00:02:49,468
It's good.

84
00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:52,098
Penny and I found a place
near Preminger. It's really nice.

85
00:02:52,122 --> 00:02:53,365
Aww. An apartment? Yeah.

86
00:02:53,389 --> 00:02:55,474
Is it small? It has
two bedrooms,

87
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:59,244
and it's really close to
some really great schools.

88
00:03:00,163 --> 00:03:01,562
You picked schools?

89
00:03:01,631 --> 00:03:03,293
No, I brought these
so that we could decide,

90
00:03:03,317 --> 00:03:05,495
so that we could talk
about the possibilities.

91
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,386
You picked brochures. It
sounds like you're decided.

92
00:03:08,455 --> 00:03:10,238
Uh, she's going to
school in New York?

93
00:03:10,307 --> 00:03:11,689
Well, I mean, if she does,

94
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:13,436
she would need to
fill out an application,

95
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,121
which, actually, I meant to
talk to... Um, okay. I'm sorry.

96
00:03:15,145 --> 00:03:18,397
We need to take, um,
a big step backwards.

97
00:03:18,449 --> 00:03:20,699
Somewhere, sometime
you heard me say yes to this.

98
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:22,634
You heard me say,
"Yes, please, Callie,

99
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:24,603
"take my daughter
across the country."

100
00:03:24,672 --> 00:03:26,938
But I never said that.

101
00:03:27,006 --> 00:03:28,618
I did not. I said we
could talk about it.

102
00:03:28,642 --> 00:03:30,108
No. Callie, what you said was,

103
00:03:30,177 --> 00:03:33,495
"You'll be able to see
Sofia whenever you want."

104
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,258
Okay, that's not what I meant.

105
00:03:35,282 --> 00:03:37,282
I'll "be able" to see her.

106
00:03:37,351 --> 00:03:39,962
I was just excited about
making this move. That's all.

107
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:43,388
Go. Be happy. Have your Penny.

108
00:03:43,457 --> 00:03:45,757
You're... You're not taking
my daughter with you.

109
00:03:45,826 --> 00:03:47,404
Please stop saying
"your daughter."

110
00:03:47,428 --> 00:03:51,279
But she is my daughter, and
she's yours, and she lives here.

111
00:03:51,348 --> 00:03:53,915
So I don't know why we're
talking about schools over there

112
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:56,618
and bedrooms and...

113
00:03:56,687 --> 00:03:58,419
I... Why can't she
come visit you?

114
00:03:58,489 --> 00:03:59,971
'Cause that's not... Okay.

115
00:04:00,024 --> 00:04:01,923
That's why we're here.

116
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:03,936
That... That's what
we're talking about.

117
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:07,160
That... We are just
discussing what the options are.

118
00:04:07,214 --> 00:04:09,764
That's not what it sounds like.

119
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:15,370
How's Hot Rock Star?

120
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,189
Filthy as ever. And creative.

121
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,924
I know, right? I've got to keep

122
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:21,726
coming up with
new names for his...

123
00:04:21,795 --> 00:04:23,996
Oh, no.

124
00:04:24,064 --> 00:04:25,797
What's wrong?

125
00:04:25,866 --> 00:04:28,328
Kyle is in town, and he
wants to take me out to dinner.

126
00:04:28,352 --> 00:04:30,368
I don't understand your face.

127
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:32,287
Mmm, no. No, I'm not going.

128
00:04:32,356 --> 00:04:34,822
Uh, why not? Free
food with bonus hot guy?

129
00:04:34,892 --> 00:04:37,859
Well, we're doing very well
right now with our fingers,

130
00:04:37,928 --> 00:04:39,072
so why screw with it?

131
00:04:39,096 --> 00:04:40,489
You mean by actually screwing.

132
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:43,147
This is fun,

133
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:45,651
but we don't actually
have anything in common.

134
00:04:45,703 --> 00:04:47,847
You know, do surgeons
even date musicians?

135
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:49,905
He is very chatty.

136
00:04:49,973 --> 00:04:53,007
No, this is Grey. She
wants labs back on her...

137
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:57,762
No. No.

138
00:04:57,831 --> 00:04:59,192
What now? No.

139
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:00,626
I just sent something
very filthy...

140
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:01,994
Well, isn't that the point?

141
00:05:02,018 --> 00:05:03,579
To Meredith Grey. Oh...

142
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:05,297
Undo, undo! Undo!
Undo! Undo! Undo!

143
00:05:05,321 --> 00:05:07,488
No! There's no undo!

144
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:13,912
Thanks.

145
00:05:16,082 --> 00:05:17,661
There you are. I know.

146
00:05:17,685 --> 00:05:18,795
And, Dr. Grey, I'm so sorry.

147
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:19,819
You should be.

148
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:22,053
Did you get Sheila's labs?

149
00:05:22,122 --> 00:05:23,962
Dr. Grey. What?

150
00:05:24,692 --> 00:05:26,391
Nothing.

151
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,860
Or thank you. You're
a very classy lady.

152
00:05:28,929 --> 00:05:31,029
Hey, Sheila, good morning. Hey.

153
00:05:31,098 --> 00:05:32,641
This is Dr. Edwards. Hi.

154
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:34,344
She will be assisting me
in surgery this afternoon.

155
00:05:34,368 --> 00:05:37,152
Uh, Sheila Davis.
5-centimeter hepatic adenoma.

156
00:05:37,221 --> 00:05:40,171
Uh, scheduled for laparoscopic
resection this afternoon.

157
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,334
She's off OCPs for...

158
00:05:41,358 --> 00:05:42,668
Could you hand me my purse?

159
00:05:42,692 --> 00:05:44,332
I think I have a
hairbrush in there.

160
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:49,414
Sure. Trying to look
good for surgery?

161
00:05:49,483 --> 00:05:51,010
Not for surgery. For him.

162
00:05:51,034 --> 00:05:52,133
James is coming today.

163
00:05:52,202 --> 00:05:53,279
Oh, that's great.

164
00:05:53,303 --> 00:05:55,403
Uh, James? My boyfriend.

165
00:05:55,472 --> 00:05:56,905
Ooh. Sort of.

166
00:05:56,973 --> 00:06:00,175
I mean, "Soul mate" is
gross, but, yes, my boyfriend.

167
00:06:00,243 --> 00:06:03,195
I'm finally meeting him
today, and I look like this.

168
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,757
You haven't met your boyfriend?

169
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:06,542
Not in person. They met online.

170
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:07,643
A year ago. Oh.

171
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:10,034
And it's been the
most amazing year.

172
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:11,569
Only over texts.

173
00:06:11,638 --> 00:06:13,899
Then I told him
about my surgery,

174
00:06:13,923 --> 00:06:16,357
and he said he had to be
here, canceled everything.

175
00:06:16,426 --> 00:06:18,421
That's really sweet. I
know it sounds crazy.

176
00:06:18,445 --> 00:06:20,212
You can get a
lot done in a text.

177
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,646
What am I doing?

178
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:23,309
I mean, why would I want
him to meet me like that?

179
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:24,777
He's going to be
expecting my profile pic,

180
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:26,862
and I don't really even look
that good on my best day.

181
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:28,886
Hey, you look fine.

182
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:31,115
And Dr. Edwards
completely understands.

183
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:33,841
She has a first date
today, too. A big one.

184
00:06:33,927 --> 00:06:35,192
Huge, apparently.

185
00:06:35,261 --> 00:06:36,360
Really? That's so nice.

186
00:06:37,196 --> 00:06:39,146
No. It's still up in the air.

187
00:06:39,215 --> 00:06:40,482
Oh.

188
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:43,818
Well, we will be back to
prep you for surgery. Okay?

189
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:45,486
Let's go, Edwards.

190
00:06:48,558 --> 00:06:50,392
Apparently, you got my text.

191
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,205
Oh, yeah. I got it good.

192
00:06:52,229 --> 00:06:54,007
Obviously, it was
not meant for you.

193
00:06:54,031 --> 00:06:56,664
I hope not, because
it sounds so painful.

194
00:06:56,733 --> 00:06:59,501
It was very unprofessional, and
I should have been more careful.

195
00:06:59,569 --> 00:07:01,414
Edwards, you really
should save your energy,

196
00:07:01,438 --> 00:07:02,915
because you're gonna need it.

197
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:04,817
Can we skip ahead to the
part where this joke is old?

198
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:06,619
No. Did you really do this?

199
00:07:06,643 --> 00:07:08,376
I have not.

200
00:07:08,445 --> 00:07:11,012
I've... I've... I
was riffing on...

201
00:07:11,081 --> 00:07:13,148
You... Okay.

202
00:07:14,584 --> 00:07:15,700
I'm sorry. I'm confused.

203
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:17,146
Your son is here? Yes!

204
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:18,914
We think so. Hers. Or mine.
They said there was a shooting.

205
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:19,982
Who said... Who
said that? The police.

206
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:21,050
When they called, we were...

207
00:07:21,074 --> 00:07:22,351
We were at work,
and... And our sons

208
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:24,325
are at... At home
with the sitter.

209
00:07:24,394 --> 00:07:25,738
The last names are Green and
Cole. Can you just look it up?

210
00:07:25,762 --> 00:07:27,123
I'm here. APRIL: I'm sorry.

211
00:07:27,147 --> 00:07:29,347
I don't see any record here
for either of those names.

212
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:30,932
I got paged. Gunshot kid?

213
00:07:31,001 --> 00:07:32,444
They said the ambulance
was coming here.

214
00:07:32,468 --> 00:07:33,713
Wait, "Gunshot kid."
That... Is that our kid?

215
00:07:33,737 --> 00:07:34,969
Karev, let's move.

216
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:36,716
We have an incoming
GSW. Victim's eight years old.

217
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,106
Oh, my God!

218
00:07:38,174 --> 00:07:39,502
Our sons are both eight
years old. Which one is it?

219
00:07:39,526 --> 00:07:40,953
Which one of our
sons has been shot?

220
00:07:40,977 --> 00:07:42,522
Ma'am, we'll know more
soon. But right now...

221
00:07:42,546 --> 00:07:44,157
Right now, we just
need you to have a seat,

222
00:07:44,181 --> 00:07:46,075
and we'll get back to you
when we know something.

223
00:07:46,099 --> 00:07:48,228
Oh, please, let them both be alive.
- Come with me.

224
00:07:48,252 --> 00:07:50,732
Come with me. Come with me.

225
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:01,629
Guys, I appreciate
that you want to help,

226
00:08:01,697 --> 00:08:03,464
but all I need
right now are Hunt,

227
00:08:03,533 --> 00:08:05,216
Wilson, and maybe
Cardio and Neuro.

228
00:08:05,269 --> 00:08:07,185
So, the rest of you can go.

229
00:08:22,886 --> 00:08:24,814
Don't! No, we have
to see who it is!

230
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:26,598
Ma'am, ma'am, please stay back.

231
00:08:40,053 --> 00:08:42,531
Eight-year-old male,
GSW to the abdomen.

232
00:08:42,555 --> 00:08:44,856
Stable after 500cc bolus NS.

233
00:08:47,143 --> 00:08:48,576
Who is it? I can't see him.

234
00:08:48,645 --> 00:08:50,473
We're... We're gonna
take care of him.

235
00:08:50,497 --> 00:08:53,297
It's all right. We're gonna
take care of him, okay?

236
00:08:59,389 --> 00:09:02,590
No! No, it's
Brandon! It's Brandon!

237
00:09:05,662 --> 00:09:07,028
Oh, thank God.

238
00:09:11,534 --> 00:09:14,068
Peter! Peter, there you are.

239
00:09:18,075 --> 00:09:19,674
Get him inside.

240
00:09:19,743 --> 00:09:20,858
Coming through.

241
00:09:22,129 --> 00:09:23,405
Brandon, Mommy's
here! I love you!

242
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:25,229
Ma'am, we've got
him. We've got him.

243
00:09:27,017 --> 00:09:28,516
ET tube in good position.

244
00:09:28,584 --> 00:09:30,885
Breath sounds clear
and equal bilaterally.

245
00:09:30,953 --> 00:09:32,631
Well, does anyone
know what happened?

246
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:33,799
Was it a drive-by?

247
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:34,933
Where the hell
was the babysitter?

248
00:09:34,957 --> 00:09:36,068
Hey, everybody, shush!

249
00:09:36,092 --> 00:09:38,126
A GSW to the right
upper quadrant.

250
00:09:38,194 --> 00:09:39,860
Belly is soft.

251
00:09:39,929 --> 00:09:41,673
Okay. I'm gonna need a...

252
00:09:41,697 --> 00:09:42,975
An ultrasound. OWEN: Mmm-hmm.

253
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:44,377
You know... You know,
let me get in there.

254
00:09:44,401 --> 00:09:45,900
I'll... I'll... I'll do it.

255
00:09:45,968 --> 00:09:47,380
He's a little tachycardic,
but his pulse is strong.

256
00:09:47,404 --> 00:09:49,287
Shepherd, any reflexes?

257
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:51,750
Spinal shock. The bullet must
have penetrated the spinal cord.

258
00:09:51,774 --> 00:09:54,386
All right, let's get him to
CT. Everyone clear the room.

259
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:56,577
All right, you heard him.
Thank you and goodbye.

260
00:09:56,646 --> 00:09:57,957
Okay, ready? JACKSON: Okay.

261
00:09:57,981 --> 00:09:59,292
Call us if you need us.

262
00:09:59,316 --> 00:10:02,266
Ready and... On my
count... One, two, three.

263
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:04,652
Pierce.

264
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,770
We're good, thanks.

265
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:09,708
Easy.

266
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:25,301
Sofia's doing really well. You
know, she loves her dance class,

267
00:10:25,325 --> 00:10:28,025
and why would we take her out
of school in the middle of the year?

268
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:29,572
No, no, no, no. We
wouldn't move her

269
00:10:29,596 --> 00:10:30,973
until after school's
over for the year.

270
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:32,942
Well, yeah, no. "We"
wouldn't move her anywhere.

271
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:35,900
Uh, "we" is you and Penny.

272
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:38,614
You can't do this. You
don't get to just decide to...

273
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:41,889
I haven't decided anything.
I'm trying to talk to you.

274
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:44,858
I'm trying to show you that
I've thought out this choice.

275
00:10:44,927 --> 00:10:46,656
But it's not just your choice.

276
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,507
To completely
disrupt our child's life...

277
00:10:48,531 --> 00:10:50,265
Why is it disrupting her life?

278
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:52,500
You moved three times a
year when you were a kid.

279
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:55,520
You turned out pretty
good. Why isn't it just life?

280
00:10:56,889 --> 00:10:58,066
I have a consult.

281
00:10:58,090 --> 00:10:59,307
Do you want to look at these?

282
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:01,192
No. No, I'm good.

283
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:06,397
He's so little.

284
00:11:06,466 --> 00:11:07,665
He's so little.

285
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:11,969
Hey, you still have that, uh,
prenatal appointment tomorrow?

286
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:13,488
Yeah, uh, at 9:00.

287
00:11:13,556 --> 00:11:15,890
Will you, um...

288
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:17,453
Just let me know how it goes.

289
00:11:17,477 --> 00:11:19,076
Absolutely. Uh, right after.

290
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:20,728
All right. Appreciate it.

291
00:11:20,796 --> 00:11:22,430
Of course.

292
00:11:26,869 --> 00:11:29,504
Brandon's injuries are severe.

293
00:11:29,572 --> 00:11:32,423
And we're taking him
up to surgery right now.

294
00:11:32,492 --> 00:11:34,337
The bullet hit his spinal cord,

295
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:36,104
so at the moment
we are evaluating...

296
00:11:36,128 --> 00:11:37,823
Patty. PATRICIA:
Stacy, are you okay?

297
00:11:37,847 --> 00:11:39,208
Were you shot at? I'm so sorry.

298
00:11:39,232 --> 00:11:40,460
I left the room for
just a few minutes.

299
00:11:40,484 --> 00:11:41,665
Were the boys out front?

300
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:43,214
Did they find the
person who did it?

301
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:47,605
No.

302
00:11:47,674 --> 00:11:49,640
The boys found your gun.

303
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:51,475
They were playing with it.

304
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:52,877
Your gun?

305
00:11:54,081 --> 00:11:55,630
You have a gun?

306
00:11:55,699 --> 00:11:58,083
Yes, I do. But it's locked.

307
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:00,835
No.

308
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:02,954
No.

309
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:05,557
We were just
playing. It went off.

310
00:12:06,325 --> 00:12:07,375
Did I kill him?

311
00:12:07,443 --> 00:12:09,910
No. Peter, no, you didn't.

312
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:12,263
Peter, Brandon's alive, okay?

313
00:12:12,331 --> 00:12:14,510
And we're gonna take
care of him right now.

314
00:12:14,534 --> 00:12:15,884
All right?

315
00:12:15,952 --> 00:12:17,485
I'm gonna need to talk to you.

316
00:12:17,554 --> 00:12:18,753
Let's go.

317
00:12:23,643 --> 00:12:25,643
We don't know that. Excuse me?

318
00:12:25,712 --> 00:12:28,012
We told that kid that
he didn't kill his friend.

319
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,246
He didn't.

320
00:12:29,315 --> 00:12:31,783
Except we don't
know that. Not yet.

321
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:39,891
Hey.

322
00:12:42,195 --> 00:12:44,362
Ooh. You all right?

323
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:48,683
Yeah, I just... I needed a
second. A little kid got shot.

324
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:50,885
Oh, God.

325
00:12:50,971 --> 00:12:52,803
Yeah. It's just awful.

326
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:56,240
Okay.

327
00:12:57,143 --> 00:12:58,787
Time's up. Yeah.

328
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:01,146
How did everything
go with Arizona?

329
00:13:01,214 --> 00:13:04,082
She's not even open to talking.

330
00:13:04,151 --> 00:13:05,895
It's like she's just saying no.

331
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,619
I'm sorry. That sucks.

332
00:13:07,687 --> 00:13:09,587
Did I jump the gun here?

333
00:13:09,656 --> 00:13:13,135
I'm just trying to get all the
ducks in a row so that we can talk,

334
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:15,738
but it seems like she really
just wants to fight about this.

335
00:13:15,762 --> 00:13:17,678
Am I wrong? Yeah, I...

336
00:13:17,747 --> 00:13:19,313
I can't help you.

337
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:22,716
There may come a time when I
get to have a say in Sofia's life,

338
00:13:22,785 --> 00:13:25,219
but that's definitely not now.

339
00:13:25,288 --> 00:13:26,720
I'd just make things worse.

340
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:30,441
So, all I can say is I'm sorry.

341
00:13:31,945 --> 00:13:33,011
That sucks.

342
00:13:42,906 --> 00:13:45,839
Coags and LFTs are normal.
She's ready when the OR's ready.

343
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:47,574
Great. How are you feeling?

344
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:50,611
Sheila, what's wrong?

345
00:13:52,115 --> 00:13:54,382
Nothing. He just texted me.

346
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:57,285
He's here in the hospital,
and he brought irises.

347
00:13:57,353 --> 00:13:59,720
He remembered I loved irises.

348
00:13:59,789 --> 00:14:03,590
It's just... I was
just freaking out.

349
00:14:03,659 --> 00:14:06,260
Okay, well, let's
try to calm down.

350
00:14:06,963 --> 00:14:08,296
Sheila Davis?

351
00:14:08,364 --> 00:14:09,630
Yes. Is he here?

352
00:14:10,217 --> 00:14:11,217
Um...

353
00:14:11,818 --> 00:14:13,351
Yeah.

354
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:14,435
Hi.

355
00:14:15,721 --> 00:14:17,738
What? Who are you?

356
00:14:17,807 --> 00:14:19,023
I'm James.

357
00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:21,270
Surprise.

358
00:14:21,294 --> 00:14:22,643
No.

359
00:14:22,712 --> 00:14:25,257
I... I... I know this isn't
what you're expecting.

360
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:27,893
I'm... I'm really, really
sorry about that, but I just...

361
00:14:27,917 --> 00:14:29,216
Oh, my God.

362
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:31,213
This isn't how I wanted to
do this at all, but when you...

363
00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:33,032
When you told me you were
sick and you needed surgery,

364
00:14:33,056 --> 00:14:34,400
I just couldn't wait.
You catfished her.

365
00:14:34,424 --> 00:14:35,951
No, I... I just
didn't want to...

366
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:38,292
Get out. Get out.

367
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:39,743
Sheila, it's... It's James.

368
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:41,473
Get out! Get out! We
should call Security.

369
00:14:41,497 --> 00:14:43,181
James, let's go.

370
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:45,099
James. Get out!

371
00:14:45,167 --> 00:14:46,584
I think we should go outside.

372
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:47,968
I just...

373
00:14:51,324 --> 00:14:54,803
L1 shattered and left
fragments in the spinal canal.

374
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:56,539
So, his mom just had
a gun laying around.

375
00:14:56,563 --> 00:14:58,140
She said she had it locked up.

376
00:14:58,164 --> 00:15:00,058
The mom should be locked up.

377
00:15:00,082 --> 00:15:01,616
Well, she might be.

378
00:15:01,684 --> 00:15:03,801
It could be involuntary
manslaughter if...

379
00:15:03,853 --> 00:15:05,414
Don't even say it.
It's not gonna happen.

380
00:15:05,438 --> 00:15:07,071
Do you own a gun?

381
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:11,675
No. No. No, I fix bullet
holes. I don't make them.

382
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,589
I just mean you're in
the Army. I imagine...

383
00:15:13,613 --> 00:15:16,091
Well, you need one in the
Army. You don't need one here.

384
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:17,325
Meanwhile, every
day, someone's kid

385
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:19,161
is in an OR with
a gunshot wound.

386
00:15:19,185 --> 00:15:20,934
Every single day.

387
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:22,714
When are people gonna
learn? It just makes things worse.

388
00:15:22,738 --> 00:15:24,616
And people always say they
need one for protection. They don't.

389
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,540
Unless they do.

390
00:15:26,609 --> 00:15:27,758
I have a gun.

391
00:15:29,111 --> 00:15:30,289
Yeah, right.

392
00:15:30,313 --> 00:15:32,158
I do. I've had one
for a long time.

393
00:15:32,182 --> 00:15:33,576
You have a gun. - Mmm-hmm.

394
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,781
Why?

395
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:36,279
Just like you said.
For protection.

396
00:15:36,303 --> 00:15:38,151
Have you used it?

397
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,915
No. I haven't
needed to, thank God.

398
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,367
Thank God you haven't
had it used against you.

399
00:15:41,391 --> 00:15:42,435
All right. Can we stop?

400
00:15:42,459 --> 00:15:43,736
There's a kid down
there scared to death

401
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,970
he might have killed his friend.

402
00:15:44,994 --> 00:15:46,572
There are two lives
on this table right now,

403
00:15:46,596 --> 00:15:49,096
so can we just stop the
chatter and pay attention?

404
00:15:51,067 --> 00:15:52,299
Right angle.

405
00:16:01,594 --> 00:16:03,139
Let me just tell him. Yes.

406
00:16:03,163 --> 00:16:04,963
Thanks for holding.
Who's calling?

407
00:16:05,365 --> 00:16:06,480
What happened?

408
00:16:07,249 --> 00:16:08,849
Right.

409
00:16:08,918 --> 00:16:11,219
Sorry? Well, how did you...

410
00:16:11,287 --> 00:16:13,566
Where were you that they
were able to get a gun?

411
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:15,756
I was...

412
00:16:15,825 --> 00:16:17,190
I left the room for a minute.

413
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,403
For a minute?

414
00:16:18,427 --> 00:16:19,726
It was so fast.

415
00:16:19,795 --> 00:16:21,813
So, but why? Why?

416
00:16:21,881 --> 00:16:23,214
What?

417
00:16:23,282 --> 00:16:25,294
Did you leave your phone
charger in the car or...

418
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:27,179
Were you texting
or was it the TV?

419
00:16:27,203 --> 00:16:29,903
No! The police already
asked me all this.

420
00:16:29,972 --> 00:16:31,884
Yeah, why were you
gone long enough

421
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:34,441
for them to unlock a drawer
or a closet or whatever

422
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:37,311
and pull out a gun and shoot it?

423
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:38,975
It was your job
to keep them safe.

424
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:40,665
It was literally your job.

425
00:16:40,734 --> 00:16:42,683
And I was doing my job.

426
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:44,585
The boys aren't
babies. They're eight.

427
00:16:44,654 --> 00:16:46,453
They go off and
they play together.

428
00:16:46,539 --> 00:16:49,973
I don't have to watch over
them every single second.

429
00:16:50,043 --> 00:16:52,609
They're good boys.

430
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:55,146
I... I should be able
to go to the bathroom

431
00:16:55,215 --> 00:16:57,064
or warm them up
some mac and cheese

432
00:16:57,133 --> 00:16:58,899
without them
shooting each other.

433
00:16:58,968 --> 00:17:00,100
Dr. Pierce.

434
00:17:00,169 --> 00:17:02,002
I was just making them food!

435
00:17:03,306 --> 00:17:04,672
This wasn't my fault!

436
00:17:04,741 --> 00:17:07,308
Can I get you to take a
look at something, please?

437
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:11,745
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

438
00:17:13,483 --> 00:17:15,327
Did they call someone for you?

439
00:17:15,351 --> 00:17:17,084
Is your mom coming?

440
00:17:18,354 --> 00:17:20,087
Uh, Dr. Pierce.

441
00:17:24,494 --> 00:17:27,356
I spent every day for an
entire year talking to him,

442
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,713
and he's just a liar.

443
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:31,660
Of course, I'm the
idiot who let it happen.

444
00:17:31,684 --> 00:17:33,795
I mean, I told him that I
loved him before we even met.

445
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:34,930
Who the hell does that?

446
00:17:34,954 --> 00:17:36,298
Well, you were ready
for something good.

447
00:17:36,322 --> 00:17:37,738
Yeah, plus, sometimes

448
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:39,985
someone can seem
really, really good onscreen.

449
00:17:40,009 --> 00:17:41,570
True. Sometimes too good.

450
00:17:41,594 --> 00:17:42,926
He was so good onscreen.

451
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:44,628
I know.

452
00:17:44,697 --> 00:17:46,830
Oh, my God. No, no, no.

453
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,699
What... What is he doing here?

454
00:17:48,768 --> 00:17:50,528
Wait. That's your date?

455
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,247
That's the guy you
were gonna do the...

456
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:53,665
Please don't. I
mean, I wouldn't.

457
00:17:53,689 --> 00:17:54,855
I'm classy, remember?

458
00:17:54,941 --> 00:17:57,341
Hi. What are you... Hey.

459
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,889
Uh, I'm working. I'll...
I'll... I'll walk with you.

460
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:01,212
I'm, uh, Kyle Diaz.

461
00:18:01,281 --> 00:18:03,147
Hi, Kyle. I feel
like I know you.

462
00:18:03,216 --> 00:18:04,514
What are you doing here?

463
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:05,644
You said you couldn't
wait to see me.

464
00:18:05,668 --> 00:18:06,951
I said a lot of things.

465
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:08,314
She did. SHEILA:
This is my life.

466
00:18:08,338 --> 00:18:09,654
I get James and you get that.

467
00:18:09,722 --> 00:18:11,266
You really need to
leave. I'm working.

468
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:13,635
You know, Edwards, you can
go and catch up if you need to.

469
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:14,779
See? We get to catch up.

470
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:16,272
No, we really... I
don't need to catch up.

471
00:18:16,296 --> 00:18:19,830
Uh, you really need to leave
because I need to go operate.

472
00:18:19,899 --> 00:18:21,799
Ooh, can I watch?

473
00:18:21,867 --> 00:18:23,467
See you do your thing? No.

474
00:18:23,536 --> 00:18:25,213
No? No, it's private, okay?

475
00:18:25,237 --> 00:18:28,455
The OR is a private
place, and you can't watch.

476
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:31,092
I'm working! This
is an OR elevator.

477
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:34,161
You can't go in here, either.
The OR is a sterile area.

478
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:36,129
You are not sterile.

479
00:18:36,199 --> 00:18:38,549
You are very, very dirty.

480
00:18:42,655 --> 00:18:44,054
Robbins.

481
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,234
I've been working on the
resident rotation schedule.

482
00:18:46,258 --> 00:18:47,358
Okay.

483
00:18:47,427 --> 00:18:48,870
Yeah, and losing
Warren and Blake,

484
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:50,872
I mean, soon enough,
it's gonna have an impact.

485
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:52,330
Yeah.

486
00:18:52,398 --> 00:18:57,100
Um, would you care if you
lost a resident for a few days

487
00:18:57,169 --> 00:18:59,297
while I get things settled? No.

488
00:18:59,321 --> 00:19:00,671
I'll give you two interns.

489
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,022
No! No! Why is it just me?

490
00:19:02,091 --> 00:19:03,602
Why are you taking
my resident away?

491
00:19:03,626 --> 00:19:05,187
Why am I the one that's just
gonna roll over and take it?

492
00:19:05,211 --> 00:19:06,689
And why don't you go
screw someone else over?

493
00:19:06,713 --> 00:19:09,263
Robbins, you might want
to take it down a notch.

494
00:19:11,668 --> 00:19:13,384
Callie's moving to New York.

495
00:19:14,703 --> 00:19:16,053
What?

496
00:19:16,122 --> 00:19:17,666
And she's trying to
take Sofia with her.

497
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:18,906
Can she do that?

498
00:19:24,297 --> 00:19:26,447
Hey. What are you doing here?

499
00:19:26,515 --> 00:19:27,932
I'm doing it.

500
00:19:28,868 --> 00:19:30,234
You're doing what?

501
00:19:30,286 --> 00:19:31,830
Something other than literally,

502
00:19:31,854 --> 00:19:34,266
literally watching the
clothes dry at my house.

503
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:35,573
Slow down.

504
00:19:35,642 --> 00:19:36,882
I'm meeting with Don Heller.

505
00:19:38,545 --> 00:19:40,595
Seriously? Yes. Yes.

506
00:19:40,663 --> 00:19:44,114
Look, I have seven years in
anesthesiology. It's perfect.

507
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:48,536
I can work, help people, earn
money, and get time in the OR.

508
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:50,104
Everybody wins.

509
00:19:50,173 --> 00:19:52,840
All right. What does... What
does Bailey think about this?

510
00:19:52,909 --> 00:19:54,803
Well, listen, it might
not even pan out. Right.

511
00:19:54,827 --> 00:19:56,104
I mean, why tell her
until it's a real thing?

512
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:57,368
That's what I thought.

513
00:19:57,397 --> 00:19:58,957
Just keep it to
ourselves. Until we know.

514
00:19:58,981 --> 00:20:00,909
You realize that's a
terrible idea, right?

515
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:02,549
It's a great idea.

516
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:03,951
I wish you luck, sir.

517
00:20:06,889 --> 00:20:09,223
It's a great idea.

518
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:11,737
I don't see any
residual bleeding.

519
00:20:11,761 --> 00:20:12,826
Can you get a good look?

520
00:20:12,912 --> 00:20:14,211
Yeah.

521
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,428
Definite CSF leak.

522
00:20:19,452 --> 00:20:22,102
We'll need to remove
the entire vertebral body

523
00:20:22,171 --> 00:20:23,916
to decompress the spinal cord, right?
- Mmm-hmm.

524
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:26,924
Problem is, I'll need to
dissect more of the aorta.

525
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:28,242
Risking paralysis?

526
00:20:28,311 --> 00:20:29,922
- Is there another option?
- Put him in a brace.

527
00:20:29,946 --> 00:20:31,490
Then he wouldn't be
completely decompressed.

528
00:20:31,514 --> 00:20:33,141
So, we risk paralyzing
him either way.

529
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:36,116
What are you gonna do?

530
00:20:36,185 --> 00:20:38,102
Do I have time to
talk to his mom?

531
00:20:38,171 --> 00:20:41,722
Both the brace and the surgery
carry some risk of paralysis.

532
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:43,602
My recommendation
is the surgery.

533
00:20:43,626 --> 00:20:46,126
It's very delicate,
but I would like to try.

534
00:20:46,195 --> 00:20:48,595
My husband's on his way.
Do I have to decide right now?

535
00:20:48,665 --> 00:20:50,798
I'm afraid we can't wait.

536
00:20:50,867 --> 00:20:54,234
Okay. Okay. Um, then
please do whatever you can.

537
00:20:54,303 --> 00:20:56,821
But he'll survive,
either way, right?

538
00:20:56,889 --> 00:20:58,366
Danielle. We're
working very hard.

539
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:00,090
He'll pull through.
I know he will.

540
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:01,375
Danielle, will you shut up?

541
00:21:01,443 --> 00:21:02,860
What?

542
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:04,573
You better hope
he pulls through.

543
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:06,113
This is not Peter's fault.

544
00:21:06,182 --> 00:21:07,826
He is a child. But the
gun was locked away.

545
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:09,778
They shouldn't have been in
my room. This is not the time...

546
00:21:09,802 --> 00:21:12,136
Don't you dare get
righteous with me.

547
00:21:12,204 --> 00:21:14,888
That was your house
and your gun and your kid

548
00:21:14,974 --> 00:21:17,341
that knew about it, not mine.

549
00:21:17,409 --> 00:21:20,227
I sent my child over
to your house to play,

550
00:21:20,295 --> 00:21:22,813
and your kid might have
made him a murderer.

551
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:35,837
Hey. Hi.

552
00:21:35,861 --> 00:21:37,461
I called the sitter.
The kids are okay.

553
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:38,606
What's wrong? What happened?

554
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:39,930
Nothing. Nothing.

555
00:21:39,999 --> 00:21:41,243
I just wanted to make sure
they're okay, and they are.

556
00:21:41,267 --> 00:21:43,167
What's wrong with you?

557
00:21:43,235 --> 00:21:45,001
Oh. Okay, you
guys haven't heard.

558
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:46,903
An eight-year-old came in today,

559
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:48,772
GSW, accidentally
shot by his friend.

560
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:51,202
Oh. Oh. Wow.

561
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:53,860
Anyway, just wanted
to check in, you know?

562
00:21:53,929 --> 00:21:55,529
Okay. Yeah.

563
00:21:58,117 --> 00:21:59,650
Man, I just...

564
00:22:00,286 --> 00:22:01,885
Kids with guns.

565
00:22:01,954 --> 00:22:03,354
Stop that.

566
00:22:03,422 --> 00:22:05,489
We're not doing
this. It's too sad.

567
00:22:05,558 --> 00:22:07,358
Shake it off. We
can be sad later.

568
00:22:07,426 --> 00:22:09,760
We're not talking juvie
GSW during my surgery.

569
00:22:13,148 --> 00:22:16,311
<i>Richard, she offered me visitation
rights to see my own daughter.</i>

570
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:18,413
Well, I... I'm sure she didn't
mean it that way, Arizona.

571
00:22:18,437 --> 00:22:20,766
<i>How else would she mean it? My
lawyer says it's an indication that...</i>

572
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:21,955
Your lawyer?

573
00:22:22,024 --> 00:22:23,941
<i>Yes, I have to protect myself.</i>

574
00:22:24,877 --> 00:22:27,144
I know you feel like you do.

575
00:22:27,213 --> 00:22:30,693
But you and Torres have always
figured out this stuff beautifully.

576
00:22:30,717 --> 00:22:33,378
Just slow down. I just
watched Jackson and April...

577
00:22:33,402 --> 00:22:34,897
<i>Yeah, I know. So
did I. It was a mess.</i>

578
00:22:34,921 --> 00:22:37,715
A mess started with overreactions
and misunderstandings.

579
00:22:37,739 --> 00:22:39,523
<i>So, what? Now I'm overreacting?</i>

580
00:22:39,592 --> 00:22:43,093
I'm saying Sofia's too important
not to ask yourself if you are

581
00:22:43,161 --> 00:22:45,561
before you do something
that can't be undone.

582
00:22:47,133 --> 00:22:48,748
<i>You're right. Of course.</i>

583
00:22:50,252 --> 00:22:51,785
<i>You're right. I know.</i>

584
00:22:55,107 --> 00:22:56,747
Retract more cephalad.

585
00:22:57,359 --> 00:22:58,459
Great.

586
00:22:58,527 --> 00:22:59,910
So, what's your deal?

587
00:22:59,978 --> 00:23:02,273
I'll establish vascular
control, and...

588
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:03,491
No, I meant about your date,

589
00:23:03,515 --> 00:23:04,659
the one you blew off out there.

590
00:23:04,683 --> 00:23:07,317
There is no deal.

591
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:09,081
- What's your deal?
- Excuse me.

592
00:23:09,105 --> 00:23:11,566
You're not supposed to tell me
to take my time to go see a guy.

593
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:13,051
You're supposed to tell
me to hurry up and prep.

594
00:23:13,075 --> 00:23:16,260
Can you please do your job
and make my life miserable?

595
00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:17,823
I'm just saying,
after all those texts,

596
00:23:17,847 --> 00:23:19,563
and then that's the
way you treat him?

597
00:23:19,632 --> 00:23:21,160
'Cause the texts are all it is.

598
00:23:21,184 --> 00:23:23,717
Yeah, it's been a few weeks,
and it's good and hot, but...

599
00:23:23,786 --> 00:23:25,666
I know. It's on my phone.

600
00:23:25,704 --> 00:23:27,482
The expectations are too high.

601
00:23:27,506 --> 00:23:29,067
There can only be
disappointment from here.

602
00:23:29,091 --> 00:23:30,331
You don't know that.

603
00:23:30,376 --> 00:23:32,955
I know I am a very
good "on paper" person.

604
00:23:32,979 --> 00:23:35,312
I mean, I shine. I'm amazing.

605
00:23:36,816 --> 00:23:40,834
But when it comes to being
an "in person" person, I...

606
00:23:40,903 --> 00:23:42,848
You said you wanted
to work and not talk,

607
00:23:42,872 --> 00:23:44,599
so can we focus
on the work, please?

608
00:23:44,623 --> 00:23:46,718
I said I didn't want
to talk about sad stuff.

609
00:23:46,742 --> 00:23:48,459
I'm okay to talk
about this stuff.

610
00:23:48,511 --> 00:23:49,751
Graspers.

611
00:23:49,795 --> 00:23:51,323
Although, this is
its own kind of sad.

612
00:23:51,347 --> 00:23:53,664
Hell. I'm in actual
hell right now.

613
00:23:53,732 --> 00:23:55,652
Well, you said to
make you miserable.

614
00:23:59,221 --> 00:24:01,254
Dr. Shepherd, BP is going down.

615
00:24:01,323 --> 00:24:02,968
How's that bone graft coming?

616
00:24:02,992 --> 00:24:05,258
It's out. Sealing
up with bone wax.

617
00:24:09,482 --> 00:24:10,722
It's in the house?

618
00:24:11,167 --> 00:24:12,382
What?

619
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:15,001
The gun. Where
is it in the house?

620
00:24:16,271 --> 00:24:17,954
It's in a safe place.

621
00:24:18,023 --> 00:24:19,985
I didn't even know it was
there. I want to know where it is.

622
00:24:20,009 --> 00:24:21,508
It's in a box under the bed.

623
00:24:21,577 --> 00:24:22,654
It's under our bed?

624
00:24:22,678 --> 00:24:23,944
That's where we'd need it.

625
00:24:24,013 --> 00:24:25,257
I don't want a gun in my house.

626
00:24:25,281 --> 00:24:27,397
It's my house, too. It
makes me feel safer.

627
00:24:27,467 --> 00:24:29,244
Does it? JO: Have you
seen our neighborhood?

628
00:24:29,268 --> 00:24:30,995
Because you're not safer.
You're more likely to get hurt

629
00:24:31,019 --> 00:24:32,580
because there's a
freakin' gun around. Alex.

630
00:24:32,604 --> 00:24:34,216
I got shot once. You know that.

631
00:24:36,642 --> 00:24:39,154
BP's 60/40.
Starting him on levo.

632
00:24:39,178 --> 00:24:41,456
Once I decompress the
spinal cord, it should get better.

633
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,720
I just... Just let me work.
- Work faster.

634
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:58,996
You okay?

635
00:24:59,065 --> 00:25:00,897
Yeah. Just watching.

636
00:25:02,134 --> 00:25:04,017
He's hypotensive now.

637
00:25:04,086 --> 00:25:05,586
You'd make a good cop.

638
00:25:07,289 --> 00:25:09,267
You nearly broke
that babysitter.

639
00:25:09,291 --> 00:25:11,008
I don't know what I was doing.

640
00:25:11,077 --> 00:25:12,442
Why did I do that?

641
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:14,578
I watch my sister's
kids all the time.

642
00:25:14,646 --> 00:25:16,947
And last week, I turned
away for one second,

643
00:25:17,016 --> 00:25:18,281
and my nephew had dumped

644
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:20,450
an entire bag of flour
on the kitchen floor.

645
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:22,185
He's three.

646
00:25:22,254 --> 00:25:23,504
And I thought,

647
00:25:23,572 --> 00:25:25,732
"What if that had been
a pot of boiling water?"

648
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:29,893
I'm not used to this.

649
00:25:29,962 --> 00:25:32,462
Being scared like
this, worrying like this.

650
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:35,999
They're not even my kids.

651
00:25:37,302 --> 00:25:38,969
Oh, I get it.

652
00:25:39,838 --> 00:25:41,605
They're family.

653
00:25:43,308 --> 00:25:44,675
Family messes you up.

654
00:25:46,778 --> 00:25:48,228
That part's new for me.

655
00:25:53,235 --> 00:25:54,434
Got a minute?

656
00:25:54,503 --> 00:25:55,935
Ben. What are you...

657
00:25:56,005 --> 00:25:58,005
I just came by to, uh...

658
00:25:58,073 --> 00:25:59,339
You know, I...

659
00:25:59,408 --> 00:26:01,019
I had a nice conversation
with Don Heller just now.

660
00:26:01,043 --> 00:26:02,621
You did? Yeah.

661
00:26:02,645 --> 00:26:04,540
I thought I could pick up some
cases as an anesthesiologist,

662
00:26:04,564 --> 00:26:05,923
and he said he'd be
happy to have me...

663
00:26:05,947 --> 00:26:07,187
No, absolutely not.

664
00:26:07,233 --> 00:26:08,360
I said, "Great.
When can I start?"

665
00:26:08,384 --> 00:26:09,783
Ben, no.

666
00:26:09,851 --> 00:26:11,796
I can't sit around that house
for five more months, Miranda.

667
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:14,633
You're suspended. Sitting
around is the damn point.

668
00:26:14,657 --> 00:26:17,858
I am suspended from the
surgical residency program.

669
00:26:17,926 --> 00:26:21,245
I won't be operating. And I
can stay current in the OR.

670
00:26:21,313 --> 00:26:22,512
I can earn a living.

671
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:23,964
Nobody's gonna go hungry.

672
00:26:24,033 --> 00:26:26,567
Look, what's it gonna
look like if the staff sees you

673
00:26:26,635 --> 00:26:28,797
sitting in surgery like
nothing happened?

674
00:26:28,821 --> 00:26:30,015
It's gonna look
like I'm working.

675
00:26:30,039 --> 00:26:31,215
It'll make me look like I'm...

676
00:26:31,239 --> 00:26:32,438
You? You?

677
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:34,107
See, it's always about your job,

678
00:26:34,176 --> 00:26:35,720
what's gonna make
you look good or bad.

679
00:26:35,744 --> 00:26:36,855
Well, what am I supposed to do?

680
00:26:36,879 --> 00:26:38,839
I don't know, but
you're not doing this.

681
00:26:39,999 --> 00:26:42,383
You run Surgery, not Anesthesia.

682
00:26:42,468 --> 00:26:43,983
You're not chief there.

683
00:26:44,053 --> 00:26:46,387
It's not your department.
It's not your call.

684
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,373
Ben, you can do this.

685
00:26:49,442 --> 00:26:50,562
Oh, I know I can.

686
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:51,925
But if you do,

687
00:26:51,994 --> 00:26:54,314
you better figure out
where you're gonna sleep.

688
00:26:59,251 --> 00:27:00,517
How you doing?

689
00:27:00,585 --> 00:27:01,885
Micro Penfield 4.

690
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:03,398
Just a few more...

691
00:27:03,422 --> 00:27:05,422
He's in V-tach, rate of 233.

692
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:07,001
- Paddles!
- No, no paddles.

693
00:27:07,025 --> 00:27:09,003
His spine is completely
unstable and exposed right now.

694
00:27:09,027 --> 00:27:10,438
- We have to.
- If you shock him,

695
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:11,857
he will move and
he will be paralyzed.

696
00:27:11,881 --> 00:27:13,163
You'll undo all my work.

697
00:27:13,232 --> 00:27:14,409
We'll try and take
him down with meds.

698
00:27:14,433 --> 00:27:16,633
Uh, push amiodarone,
125 milligrams.

699
00:27:16,702 --> 00:27:17,895
Just give me a minute.

700
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:19,514
Add vaso on top of his pressors.

701
00:27:19,538 --> 00:27:21,166
V-fib. ALEX: Shepherd,
we have to shock him.

702
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:22,618
Charge to 50. No! If he
moves, he won't walk.

703
00:27:22,642 --> 00:27:24,858
If he dies, he won't
walk, either. Clear.

704
00:27:24,927 --> 00:27:26,271
Amelia, clear!

705
00:27:26,295 --> 00:27:27,994
Just give me... Damn it!

706
00:27:28,464 --> 00:27:29,544
Clear.

707
00:27:43,629 --> 00:27:44,912
Is Sheila okay?

708
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:47,547
James, Sheila was very
clear. She wants you to leave.

709
00:27:47,616 --> 00:27:49,077
I love her. I
wasn't trying to lie.

710
00:27:49,101 --> 00:27:50,200
Should I call Security?

711
00:27:50,269 --> 00:27:51,601
We talked online every day.

712
00:27:51,671 --> 00:27:53,548
We understand each
other in a way that...

713
00:27:53,572 --> 00:27:56,818
I've never been seen like that
or loved like that for who I am.

714
00:27:56,842 --> 00:27:58,641
Well, not exactly who you are.

715
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:01,028
Yes. Who I am, not
just what I look like.

716
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:02,774
So, when she asked
to see my picture,

717
00:28:02,798 --> 00:28:05,265
I... I looked at myself
in the mirror and...

718
00:28:05,334 --> 00:28:06,583
I got scared.

719
00:28:06,652 --> 00:28:08,413
I knew this could
happen. I'm not stupid.

720
00:28:08,437 --> 00:28:11,805
But then, when she
was dying, I had to risk it.

721
00:28:11,873 --> 00:28:13,056
Well, she wasn't dying.

722
00:28:13,125 --> 00:28:14,286
Her tumor, I mean.

723
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:15,692
It was a benign tumor.

724
00:28:15,761 --> 00:28:17,856
The chances of it killing
her were very, very low.

725
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,279
Excuse me?

726
00:28:19,347 --> 00:28:20,546
Yeah.

727
00:28:23,135 --> 00:28:24,568
You told me you were dying!

728
00:28:24,636 --> 00:28:26,047
Get out. You said you
had a malignant tumor.

729
00:28:26,071 --> 00:28:27,265
You said you were 6'2".

730
00:28:27,289 --> 00:28:28,449
How could you lie
straight to my face?

731
00:28:28,473 --> 00:28:29,684
It wasn't even
your face, you liar.

732
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:31,169
You said you were dying!
You said you had hair!

733
00:28:31,193 --> 00:28:32,587
I can't believe I fell for
someone so superficial!

734
00:28:32,611 --> 00:28:33,888
A person does not get
to call me superficial...

735
00:28:33,912 --> 00:28:35,812
Are you calling
Security or am I?

736
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:38,041
I will, and I will handle
Sheila's post-op.

737
00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:39,260
You're done here.

738
00:28:39,284 --> 00:28:40,534
Pardon me?

739
00:28:40,602 --> 00:28:43,098
Edwards, go. Bite the
bullet. Go on the date.

740
00:28:43,122 --> 00:28:45,154
It's better than being
lonely and crazy like me

741
00:28:45,224 --> 00:28:46,868
or having sex with your
phone in the residents' lounge.

742
00:28:46,892 --> 00:28:48,157
Can you not...

743
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:50,121
Go. And don't text me from it.

744
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:51,528
You owe me $500!

745
00:28:51,597 --> 00:28:53,408
You owe me a
year of my life back!

746
00:28:53,432 --> 00:28:55,143
God, I told you I loved
you. Stop yelling at me.

747
00:28:55,167 --> 00:28:56,516
So, you do love me.

748
00:28:56,585 --> 00:28:57,884
No, no. I loved a stranger!

749
00:28:57,953 --> 00:28:59,302
Security.

750
00:29:04,626 --> 00:29:06,509
Hmm? Oh.

751
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:08,111
What is it, Torres?

752
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:11,214
No, uh... We had a meeting
scheduled for now, but you're busy.

753
00:29:11,283 --> 00:29:12,632
What's it about?

754
00:29:12,701 --> 00:29:14,000
Um, it can wait.

755
00:29:14,069 --> 00:29:15,802
Not gonna get any
less busy, Torres.

756
00:29:15,871 --> 00:29:17,064
Just tell me. I'd rather...

757
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:18,282
I'd rather wait.

758
00:29:18,306 --> 00:29:20,507
What is it?

759
00:29:20,576 --> 00:29:22,854
I'm moving to New
York with Penny Blake.

760
00:29:22,878 --> 00:29:24,227
I'm leaving Grey Sloan.

761
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:27,608
Uh, excuse us, please.
Mmm-hmm. Sure.

762
00:29:27,632 --> 00:29:28,815
When?

763
00:29:28,884 --> 00:29:32,719
Well, Penny starts work
in a couple of months,

764
00:29:32,787 --> 00:29:35,405
so first I need to get
some things squared away.

765
00:29:35,474 --> 00:29:37,457
Like a job?

766
00:29:37,526 --> 00:29:40,305
Uh, I already have an offer from
NYU, and Columbia's been calling,

767
00:29:40,329 --> 00:29:41,773
so there's been a
couple of other...

768
00:29:41,797 --> 00:29:44,881
They offered you
Chief of Ortho? No.

769
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:48,184
Um, it'll be fewer hours. And
Penny's working a lot, so...

770
00:29:48,253 --> 00:29:50,573
And I'm hoping to
have Sofia there.

771
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:52,839
Ugh. What?

772
00:29:52,908 --> 00:29:54,674
I mean, your career...

773
00:29:54,743 --> 00:29:57,310
You're a chief.
She's a resident.

774
00:29:57,379 --> 00:30:00,764
So, you're giving up your career
to chase tail across the country?

775
00:30:02,935 --> 00:30:04,629
I just wanted to
give you notice.

776
00:30:04,653 --> 00:30:06,164
And I don't need your judgment.

777
00:30:06,188 --> 00:30:08,508
Arizona's already
got that covered.

778
00:30:16,748 --> 00:30:19,127
Hey. Start her on D-5 half. I'll
be back in about a half an hour.

779
00:30:19,151 --> 00:30:20,583
Okay.

780
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,487
Hi. This is Dr. Robbins.

781
00:30:24,556 --> 00:30:26,189
I'm sorry. From where?

782
00:30:28,694 --> 00:30:30,761
Yes, I am.

783
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:33,663
Yeah, you bet I have a minute.

784
00:30:33,732 --> 00:30:36,266
There's a chance of some
recovery of movement,

785
00:30:36,335 --> 00:30:38,068
but it's very small.

786
00:30:38,137 --> 00:30:40,315
He'll get physical and
occupational therapy

787
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:43,652
to help him regain some
function, find some new ways...

788
00:30:43,676 --> 00:30:44,958
But he'll never walk again?

789
00:30:45,894 --> 00:30:48,111
I'm sorry. It's very unlikely.

790
00:30:52,968 --> 00:30:54,701
The gun was locked up.

791
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:57,420
It was supposed to be
locked in a drawer. It was.

792
00:30:58,273 --> 00:30:59,389
I don't know how they...

793
00:30:59,458 --> 00:31:00,538
Kids watch.

794
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,100
They pick up everything you do.

795
00:31:06,598 --> 00:31:08,398
I'm very sorry
that this happened.

796
00:31:32,941 --> 00:31:34,091
Hey.

797
00:31:34,876 --> 00:31:36,325
Brandon didn't die?

798
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:38,362
No. He didn't.

799
00:31:39,131 --> 00:31:40,897
But he can't walk?

800
00:31:42,367 --> 00:31:44,134
And he can't ride bikes?

801
00:31:47,872 --> 00:31:49,706
Is he mad at me?

802
00:31:58,217 --> 00:32:00,784
If it had been
Brandon who hurt you,

803
00:32:00,852 --> 00:32:02,386
would you be mad at him?

804
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:08,341
A little. But it was
just an accident.

805
00:32:08,410 --> 00:32:10,226
Right.

806
00:32:10,295 --> 00:32:12,879
So, I want you to
promise me something.

807
00:32:12,948 --> 00:32:15,898
Whenever you feel bad
about this, I want you to say,

808
00:32:17,069 --> 00:32:19,469
"It was an accident.

809
00:32:19,537 --> 00:32:20,870
"I didn't mean to."

810
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:24,307
I know that.

811
00:32:24,376 --> 00:32:25,942
But you have to know it, too.

812
00:32:26,011 --> 00:32:28,378
So, you got to promise
me you will say,

813
00:32:29,314 --> 00:32:32,115
"I didn't mean to."

814
00:32:34,686 --> 00:32:36,765
We can go now,
right? We're free to go?

815
00:32:36,789 --> 00:32:37,921
Will you promise me that?

816
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:39,689
Peter, honey, it's time to go.

817
00:32:44,897 --> 00:32:46,163
Thank you.

818
00:33:06,385 --> 00:33:10,420
Well, Brandon's
doing fine. His BP's...

819
00:33:16,261 --> 00:33:21,214
I lived in my car when
I was 16 years old.

820
00:33:21,283 --> 00:33:25,202
Every night, trying to fall
asleep, I would listen to the voices.

821
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:31,557
People going by, people
who had nothing going on,

822
00:33:31,626 --> 00:33:34,694
nothing going for
them, nothing to lose,

823
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:37,542
scared to death that they
would break in and take my stuff,

824
00:33:37,566 --> 00:33:39,566
take me.

825
00:33:39,634 --> 00:33:44,954
This gun made me
feel like I had something,

826
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:47,490
something on them.

827
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:49,625
But then, today...

828
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:55,815
That little boy will
never walk again.

829
00:33:55,901 --> 00:33:57,300
Jo, he's still alive.

830
00:33:57,369 --> 00:33:58,535
Barely.

831
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:03,256
You know, back then, I...

832
00:34:04,526 --> 00:34:07,460
I didn't value my life
all that much, but...

833
00:34:10,898 --> 00:34:12,148
It's different now.

834
00:34:13,118 --> 00:34:14,884
I've outgrown this.

835
00:34:16,722 --> 00:34:18,521
I don't need it anymore.

836
00:34:19,824 --> 00:34:21,224
I don't want it.

837
00:34:42,748 --> 00:34:45,282
I thought we were
getting drinks.

838
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:48,318
Your exact words were
"Somewhere special."

839
00:34:48,387 --> 00:34:51,187
Come on.

840
00:34:51,256 --> 00:34:54,357
This is, uh... This
is the holy ground.

841
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:57,894
Also the dirty ground
with the dirty rugs and...

842
00:34:59,164 --> 00:35:01,097
Have they ever
cleaned any of these?

843
00:35:01,166 --> 00:35:02,977
No, they've never
changed anything in here,

844
00:35:03,001 --> 00:35:04,412
the paint or the
rugs. They don't...

845
00:35:04,436 --> 00:35:05,647
They don't really
want to mess with the...

846
00:35:05,671 --> 00:35:07,136
With the acoustics, you know,

847
00:35:07,205 --> 00:35:09,872
or the, uh... Or the mojo.

848
00:35:09,942 --> 00:35:13,142
Every major musician from
Seattle has recorded here.

849
00:35:13,345 --> 00:35:14,694
Hmm?

850
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:16,246
And now me.

851
00:35:17,933 --> 00:35:20,253
All I wanted was
just to record here,

852
00:35:21,003 --> 00:35:24,220
right here, this...
This very room.

853
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:26,049
Huh. You know, this is...

854
00:35:26,107 --> 00:35:28,825
This is where I... I feel
the most like myself.

855
00:35:30,011 --> 00:35:32,629
This is the me
that I like the most.

856
00:35:32,697 --> 00:35:34,375
Yeah, I get that. I get that.

857
00:35:34,399 --> 00:35:38,235
The OR's kind of
that way for me.

858
00:35:38,303 --> 00:35:40,315
You know, the feel
of the scrub brush,

859
00:35:40,339 --> 00:35:42,499
the smell of the
antiseptic, it's just...

860
00:35:44,525 --> 00:35:46,925
The air changes
when you walk in.

861
00:35:47,462 --> 00:35:48,828
It gets cold.

862
00:35:48,897 --> 00:35:51,798
You can feel your mind sharpen
as you step up to the table.

863
00:35:51,867 --> 00:35:53,411
Yeah, it's like... Like
you turn it up a notch.

864
00:35:53,435 --> 00:35:54,645
Or a bunch of notches.

865
00:35:54,669 --> 00:35:55,879
Like you get charged.

866
00:35:55,903 --> 00:35:57,003
Yeah, right.

867
00:36:00,692 --> 00:36:02,291
Okay.

868
00:36:03,862 --> 00:36:06,129
I like it. Okay. Whew!

869
00:36:06,198 --> 00:36:08,364
Thank you. Thank you.

870
00:36:09,634 --> 00:36:10,833
Come on.

871
00:36:10,902 --> 00:36:12,280
What is this? What
is this "come on"?

872
00:36:12,304 --> 00:36:13,898
Aren't you gonna
play something for me?

873
00:36:13,922 --> 00:36:15,400
Oh, you want me to play for you?

874
00:36:15,424 --> 00:36:17,841
Isn't that your move? Don't
you play for all the girls?

875
00:36:17,909 --> 00:36:19,642
Hey, it's my life.

876
00:36:19,711 --> 00:36:21,744
You know, when I'm playing,

877
00:36:21,813 --> 00:36:23,413
it's how I let someone in,

878
00:36:23,482 --> 00:36:25,276
let someone see...

879
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:26,911
Okay, it's my move, right? Yeah.

880
00:36:26,935 --> 00:36:29,869
It's my move. But it
always works, though.

881
00:36:29,938 --> 00:36:31,221
Yeah, I bet.

882
00:36:36,945 --> 00:36:38,228
You want me to play for you?

883
00:36:46,905 --> 00:36:48,605
Kyle, you don't need moves.

884
00:37:05,774 --> 00:37:07,273
Okay. I'm ready. Let's go.

885
00:37:07,342 --> 00:37:09,876
I just want to go see the kids.

886
00:37:09,945 --> 00:37:12,378
I did something very good today.

887
00:37:12,447 --> 00:37:14,547
I pushed two hearts together.

888
00:37:14,616 --> 00:37:17,517
I forwarded the cause of love.

889
00:37:17,585 --> 00:37:20,865
What's wrong? What's wrong?

890
00:37:20,889 --> 00:37:23,006
I... I don't know
how you do it, Mer.

891
00:37:23,075 --> 00:37:24,173
Do what?

892
00:37:24,243 --> 00:37:25,942
Love your kids like this.

893
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:28,528
I really love them.

894
00:37:28,614 --> 00:37:30,814
They love you, too.
No, I love them like...

895
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,250
If something happened
to them, I would die.

896
00:37:34,319 --> 00:37:37,987
Like, my heart is so wide
open, and they're so fragile.

897
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:40,040
I don't know how you
live like this. I don't.

898
00:37:41,943 --> 00:37:43,093
It's awful.

899
00:37:46,498 --> 00:37:49,398
Sometimes, you just
have to push through it,

900
00:37:49,467 --> 00:37:52,769
push the awful aside,
just get through the day.

901
00:37:57,075 --> 00:37:58,675
Hey. Hey.

902
00:38:00,879 --> 00:38:03,179
I think you saved
that boy today.

903
00:38:03,248 --> 00:38:05,548
I paralyzed that boy today.

904
00:38:06,351 --> 00:38:07,495
I was too slow.

905
00:38:07,519 --> 00:38:09,119
No, I meant Peter.

906
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:16,092
Nathan...

907
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:20,291
Nathan cheated on my sister.

908
00:38:20,315 --> 00:38:23,216
I know. I, uh... I...

909
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:29,222
And when she found out,
she called. She told me.

910
00:38:30,875 --> 00:38:32,258
And I said...

911
00:38:34,813 --> 00:38:37,080
I said,

912
00:38:37,983 --> 00:38:40,684
"Just forget about
him. Walk away.

913
00:38:40,752 --> 00:38:43,669
"Just get on a chopper
and come to me."

914
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:46,005
I told my sister to
get on that helicopter.

915
00:38:48,610 --> 00:38:49,842
I did it.

916
00:38:53,415 --> 00:38:55,181
And

917
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:58,050
that was the last
thing I ever said to her.

918
00:39:14,369 --> 00:39:15,901
You didn't mean to.

919
00:39:24,846 --> 00:39:26,146
Hey.

920
00:39:26,814 --> 00:39:27,947
Got a late one, huh?

921
00:39:28,016 --> 00:39:29,365
I do.

922
00:39:29,434 --> 00:39:30,750
Everything okay?

923
00:39:30,819 --> 00:39:34,820
I wondered if you wanted to
go in the morning to the OB.

924
00:39:34,889 --> 00:39:36,539
Of course I do. Yeah.

925
00:39:36,608 --> 00:39:38,274
Good.

926
00:39:38,342 --> 00:39:39,862
Baby should know
that you're there.

927
00:39:40,695 --> 00:39:41,945
I will be there.

928
00:39:42,013 --> 00:39:43,679
Uh, 9:00 a.m.? Sure.

929
00:39:50,922 --> 00:39:54,940
Hey, there he is.
Glad to see you, man.

930
00:39:55,010 --> 00:39:56,859
Glad it all worked out.

931
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:58,962
Yep. Yep, it worked out.

932
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:01,997
<i>Once we fire that first
shot, we're committed.</i>

933
00:40:12,143 --> 00:40:15,545
God, she was so little.

934
00:40:15,614 --> 00:40:17,213
You remember when
Sofia was in here

935
00:40:17,282 --> 00:40:22,118
and you could... See her
heartbeat in her whole body?

936
00:40:22,186 --> 00:40:25,988
God, how impossibly
tiny she was.

937
00:40:26,057 --> 00:40:28,424
I can't believe our
girl was ever that little.

938
00:40:28,493 --> 00:40:30,813
<i>There's almost no
way to take it back.</i>

939
00:40:33,865 --> 00:40:36,966
I jumped the gun. I'm so sorry.

940
00:40:37,034 --> 00:40:41,020
I was carried away
when I first told you.

941
00:40:41,089 --> 00:40:43,205
And I've done
everything wrong since.

942
00:40:45,126 --> 00:40:46,626
Sofia is our little girl,

943
00:40:46,695 --> 00:40:50,563
and I am not trying to
make plans without you.

944
00:40:50,649 --> 00:40:51,981
Please believe that.

945
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:54,517
The Barton School called me.

946
00:40:54,585 --> 00:40:57,086
They wanted to talk to
me about her application,

947
00:40:57,155 --> 00:40:58,371
which they loved.

948
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,022
They called you?

949
00:41:00,091 --> 00:41:02,470
So, tell me that part again about
how you're not making plans?

950
00:41:02,494 --> 00:41:04,522
You know how these things
work. There are waiting lists.

951
00:41:04,546 --> 00:41:05,939
It doesn't mean that I
actually tried to make...

952
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:07,558
We're not talking
about this anymore.

953
00:41:07,582 --> 00:41:09,565
Hey, you don't get to
decide that. I'm going.

954
00:41:09,634 --> 00:41:11,100
I don't want to
leave Sofia behind,

955
00:41:11,169 --> 00:41:12,602
so we have to
work out something.

956
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:14,899
Yeah, I just mean that you're
not talking to me about it anymore.

957
00:41:14,923 --> 00:41:18,741
<i>The question becomes
do we keep firing back...</i>

958
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:19,892
You got a lawyer?

959
00:41:19,961 --> 00:41:21,410
Yeah. You can talk to her.

960
00:41:24,782 --> 00:41:25,932
You hired a lawyer.

961
00:41:27,402 --> 00:41:28,734
Yes.

962
00:41:28,803 --> 00:41:30,963
Now who's jumping the gun?

963
00:41:32,039 --> 00:41:34,674
You started this.

964
00:41:41,583 --> 00:41:43,449
All right.

965
00:41:43,518 --> 00:41:45,478
<i>And declare an all-out war?</i>
