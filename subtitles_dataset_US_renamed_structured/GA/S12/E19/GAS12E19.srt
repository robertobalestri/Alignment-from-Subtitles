1
00:00:03,904 --> 00:00:05,887
<i>Surgeons have a saying,</i>

2
00:00:05,956 --> 00:00:07,489
<i>"All bleeding must stop."</i>

3
00:00:07,558 --> 00:00:10,925
<i>It's sort of our version
of "This, too, shall pass."</i>

4
00:00:10,994 --> 00:00:13,796
<i>Every crisis will
eventually come to an end.</i>

5
00:00:13,864 --> 00:00:16,292
<i>You'll either save your
patient, or you won't.</i>

6
00:00:16,316 --> 00:00:18,483
Are they gonna ask me about...
- Ben.

7
00:00:18,552 --> 00:00:21,202
Right. You can't tell me.

8
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:22,511
How's Omar doing?

9
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:23,806
I can't...

10
00:00:23,874 --> 00:00:25,874
Can't tell me that, either.

11
00:00:25,942 --> 00:00:27,970
Just doing my job.

12
00:00:27,994 --> 00:00:30,863
Thank you, Chief.

13
00:00:30,931 --> 00:00:32,893
Ah. It's a good thing I'm
not trying to save lives

14
00:00:32,917 --> 00:00:36,685
so I can see that the
elevator doors are open.

15
00:00:36,754 --> 00:00:38,398
<i>So...</i>

16
00:00:38,422 --> 00:00:41,723
<i>One way or the other,
the bleeding will stop.</i>

17
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:44,793
<i>Actually, as far as sayings go,</i>

18
00:00:44,862 --> 00:00:47,329
<i>this one's really not
all that comforting.</i>

19
00:00:47,398 --> 00:00:49,318
Omar Singh, post-op day one,

20
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:51,416
following abdominal
and chest surgery

21
00:00:51,485 --> 00:00:53,880
to repair injuries sustained
during a car accident.

22
00:00:53,904 --> 00:00:55,720
DeLuca? Shortly after surgery,

23
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:57,272
Omar went into cardiac arrest.

24
00:00:57,341 --> 00:00:59,574
Dr. Shepherd placed him
on therapeutic hypothermia

25
00:00:59,643 --> 00:01:01,187
as part of a new
resuscitation protocol.

26
00:01:01,211 --> 00:01:03,022
Tell me why. We hoped
that cooling the patient...

27
00:01:03,046 --> 00:01:05,242
He's regaining consciousness,
and he's breathing spontaneously,

28
00:01:05,266 --> 00:01:06,515
so they'll extubate soon.

29
00:01:06,584 --> 00:01:07,616
Thank God.

30
00:01:07,685 --> 00:01:09,033
Uh, Grey, you should go.

31
00:01:09,103 --> 00:01:10,943
They're waiting for you. Okay.

32
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:16,275
Oh, I put together
an advisory panel...

33
00:01:16,343 --> 00:01:18,226
Grey, Hunt, Pierce.

34
00:01:18,295 --> 00:01:20,962
They're going to review
the Warren situation.

35
00:01:21,031 --> 00:01:23,932
Bailey, we talked about this.

36
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:26,680
As the leader of this surgical
staff, you need to take charge of it.

37
00:01:26,704 --> 00:01:28,770
As the leader of
this surgical staff,

38
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:30,238
I need to know my limitations.

39
00:01:30,307 --> 00:01:33,509
And I know I cannot be
impartial about my husband

40
00:01:33,577 --> 00:01:35,911
and the future of his career.

41
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:40,015
As a leader, I am taking
charge of my lack of impartiality

42
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:44,753
by convening an advisory
panel to review the matter.

43
00:01:44,821 --> 00:01:46,555
Once they give me
their recommendation

44
00:01:46,623 --> 00:01:50,124
for how to proceed, as a leader,

45
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:55,397
I will make a final decision on
what happens with my husband.

46
00:01:55,465 --> 00:01:58,350
As a human being, I'll
stand here and thank the Lord

47
00:01:58,402 --> 00:02:00,702
that my husband
isn't responsible

48
00:02:00,771 --> 00:02:04,539
for leaving three children
without any parents at all.

49
00:02:14,451 --> 00:02:16,818
Warren, have a seat.

50
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:18,815
When Miranda told me that
there was an advisory committee,

51
00:02:18,839 --> 00:02:22,424
I pictured a bunch of
lawyers and hospital suits.

52
00:02:22,492 --> 00:02:24,525
Okay. I'm, uh,
glad it's you guys.

53
00:02:27,097 --> 00:02:28,140
Let's do it.

54
00:02:28,164 --> 00:02:29,308
Dr. Warren, be apprised

55
00:02:29,332 --> 00:02:30,443
that the purpose
of this committee

56
00:02:30,467 --> 00:02:32,217
is to understand the incident

57
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:34,330
and to make recommendations
for disciplinary action,

58
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:35,670
should it be called for.

59
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:37,172
A lack of full cooperation

60
00:02:37,241 --> 00:02:39,386
with or withholding of
information from this committee

61
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:43,511
will result in your immediate
dismissal from the residency program.

62
00:02:45,182 --> 00:02:46,581
Okay.

63
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:47,850
You accept these conditions?

64
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:50,051
Yes.

65
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:53,054
Okay. Let's begin then.

66
00:02:53,123 --> 00:02:55,173
Wait. So, she's still
accusing me of harassment?

67
00:02:55,242 --> 00:02:57,275
I mean, I tried to
meet her halfway here.

68
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:59,244
I tried to take the
high road. This...

69
00:02:59,313 --> 00:03:01,791
Apparently, the high road is
paved with restraining orders.

70
00:03:01,815 --> 00:03:03,281
I'm sorry. I'll be quiet.

71
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:05,295
The restraining order
actually works for us.

72
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:06,796
When we take her to
court to have it lifted,

73
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:09,321
she won't be able to prove
any of these allegations,

74
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:11,201
and her character will
be called into question,

75
00:03:11,225 --> 00:03:13,035
which is exactly
where we want to be.

76
00:03:13,059 --> 00:03:15,372
Because? Because
once that baby is born,

77
00:03:15,396 --> 00:03:19,147
you will have a very good
shot at obtaining full custody.

78
00:03:19,216 --> 00:03:21,366
Full custody?

79
00:03:21,435 --> 00:03:22,967
No. He would never.

80
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,436
He would.

81
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:26,032
Look, I know that I'm
just here for support,

82
00:03:26,056 --> 00:03:27,589
but why would Jackson do that?

83
00:03:27,658 --> 00:03:30,858
Because it's exactly what
I would advise her to do.

84
00:03:30,927 --> 00:03:33,044
Whether you
meant it or not, April,

85
00:03:33,113 --> 00:03:35,480
this restraining order
started an arms race.

86
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:39,083
The restraining order was a
mistake. Can't we just take it back?

87
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:42,721
I'm serious here. Do
not try to talk to him.

88
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:45,273
The restraining
order needs to stand.

89
00:03:45,342 --> 00:03:48,076
We have to do
this together, okay?

90
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:52,781
This is exactly what
I was trying to avoid.

91
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:55,917
After everything that
happened with Samuel, I just...

92
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:57,797
I just want to keep
this baby safe.

93
00:03:57,821 --> 00:04:00,505
Good. See? You felt
your baby was in danger.

94
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:02,807
That's great. That we can use.

95
00:04:09,366 --> 00:04:10,431
Wow.

96
00:04:11,201 --> 00:04:12,300
Fractured pelvis?

97
00:04:12,369 --> 00:04:13,535
Stepped on by a horse.

98
00:04:14,571 --> 00:04:16,888
So, tomorrow's the day.

99
00:04:16,957 --> 00:04:20,308
Preminger Grant,
yes or no, stay or go.

100
00:04:20,377 --> 00:04:22,827
Oh, you haven't given
them an answer yet?

101
00:04:22,896 --> 00:04:24,924
You thought I would
have given them an answer

102
00:04:24,948 --> 00:04:26,526
and not talked to
you about it? No.

103
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:27,983
No. I'm just saying,

104
00:04:28,051 --> 00:04:30,730
the Preminger Grant's a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

105
00:04:30,754 --> 00:04:32,086
If I say yes,

106
00:04:32,155 --> 00:04:35,489
I will be moving to New
York for at least a year.

107
00:04:36,293 --> 00:04:37,526
Right.

108
00:04:37,594 --> 00:04:39,794
And you're fine with that?
Are you fine with that?

109
00:04:40,931 --> 00:04:43,065
Well, like you said, it's...

110
00:04:43,934 --> 00:04:45,014
Once in a lifetime.

111
00:04:47,721 --> 00:04:51,356
Yep. Well, I got to get
this pelvis into the OR.

112
00:04:56,413 --> 00:04:57,645
Reggie Dalton?

113
00:04:57,714 --> 00:04:59,347
I'm Dr. Jo Wilson.

114
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:01,283
Your chart says that
you have a hernia.

115
00:05:01,351 --> 00:05:02,717
Yeah. It's the worst.

116
00:05:02,786 --> 00:05:05,019
Okay, well, let's take
a look. Just lay back.

117
00:05:05,089 --> 00:05:07,506
I'm gonna lift up your shirt.

118
00:05:07,574 --> 00:05:09,419
Okay, so, how long has
this been going on for?

119
00:05:09,443 --> 00:05:11,943
Uh, I had surgery,
like, uh, six months ago,

120
00:05:12,012 --> 00:05:13,539
and after a while,
this little guy

121
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:15,008
just started
popping out of there.

122
00:05:15,032 --> 00:05:16,760
Six months ago? Yeah.

123
00:05:16,784 --> 00:05:17,910
I had it looked at once before,

124
00:05:17,934 --> 00:05:19,161
and they said
they could operate,

125
00:05:19,185 --> 00:05:20,652
but that it wasn't urgent.

126
00:05:20,721 --> 00:05:22,721
So, I put it off, and...

127
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:24,889
Oh, God. Oh, no. Oh, no.

128
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:26,958
Reggie, are you okay? Yes.

129
00:05:27,027 --> 00:05:28,460
So, this is the thing...

130
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:31,596
It's allergy season, and
every time I sneeze...

131
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:33,264
The little guy pops out.

132
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,599
I think maybe I've waited

133
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:37,085
a little too long to
get surgery because...

134
00:05:37,154 --> 00:05:38,631
Oh, no! Okay,
Reggie, don't fight it.

135
00:05:38,655 --> 00:05:40,138
It's only gonna make it worse.

136
00:05:42,376 --> 00:05:43,616
Worse than this?

137
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,428
Is my baby gonna die? No.

138
00:05:54,755 --> 00:05:56,875
It's open before
you even touch her.

139
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,284
I know that's
what it looks like.

140
00:05:58,308 --> 00:06:00,925
That's what it is,
Warren, right there.

141
00:06:00,994 --> 00:06:02,944
You said you didn't
see the doors open.

142
00:06:03,013 --> 00:06:04,712
Yes. I mean, no.

143
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:06,292
Well, which is it? Did
you? Or didn't you?

144
00:06:06,316 --> 00:06:07,556
I didn't see them open.

145
00:06:07,601 --> 00:06:08,795
It is right there
in front of you.

146
00:06:08,819 --> 00:06:11,019
I know, but I didn't see it.

147
00:06:11,087 --> 00:06:12,231
It didn't register.

148
00:06:12,255 --> 00:06:15,056
Okay. Help me here. Was it...

149
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,609
Had you already
decided to cut? No.

150
00:06:17,678 --> 00:06:18,871
Or did you decide

151
00:06:18,895 --> 00:06:20,606
getting in the elevator
and up to the OR

152
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,740
was just gonna take too long?

153
00:06:21,764 --> 00:06:23,498
No.

154
00:06:23,566 --> 00:06:26,701
Ben, lying right now is going
to make this end very quickly.

155
00:06:26,769 --> 00:06:29,237
I didn't see them open.

156
00:06:38,048 --> 00:06:39,430
I spoke with your grandma,

157
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:42,400
and she'll be here
in a couple of hours.

158
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:46,971
Your dad still has a long
recovery ahead of him,

159
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,807
but the fact that he's waking
up is a really good sign.

160
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:51,721
You said I can see
him when he wakes up.

161
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:52,878
I did.

162
00:06:52,946 --> 00:06:54,062
And you will.

163
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:55,930
When? How about now?

164
00:06:56,533 --> 00:06:58,516
Yeah? Come on.

165
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:00,151
Now, before we go in,

166
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,053
your dad's connected
to some tubes,

167
00:07:02,122 --> 00:07:03,666
- but that's normal...
- Coming through!

168
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:05,590
So, don't be scared when the...

169
00:07:05,659 --> 00:07:07,141
Wait, Jasmine!

170
00:07:07,211 --> 00:07:08,320
Daddy? STEPHANIE:
DeLuca, get the suction...

171
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:09,489
Okay, got it. - Daddy?

172
00:07:09,513 --> 00:07:11,307
Push more lorazepam.
What's wrong with him?

173
00:07:11,331 --> 00:07:12,792
We're gonna need to put
him back on the ventilator.

174
00:07:12,816 --> 00:07:14,232
Prep for RSI.

175
00:07:14,301 --> 00:07:15,678
Jasmine, they need to help him.

176
00:07:15,702 --> 00:07:18,437
You said he was awake.
You said he was okay!

177
00:07:18,505 --> 00:07:20,071
I know. I know, honey.

178
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,340
Come on.

179
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:26,244
They were done
with me for the day.

180
00:07:27,014 --> 00:07:28,646
Okay.

181
00:07:28,715 --> 00:07:30,798
They needed to talk to
the other doctors involved.

182
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:32,645
I see. I wanted to
check on my post-ops,

183
00:07:32,669 --> 00:07:34,113
but they told me I
couldn't go back to work

184
00:07:34,137 --> 00:07:35,748
until all of this was...
Yeah, it's best that you

185
00:07:35,772 --> 00:07:37,733
not have contact
with any patients.

186
00:07:37,757 --> 00:07:40,091
Okay, then...

187
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:44,863
Well, I guess I'll just pick
up Tuck early from school.

188
00:07:44,932 --> 00:07:47,699
You know, he's been begging
me to go to this new arcade.

189
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:49,201
Did he clean his room?

190
00:07:50,103 --> 00:07:51,853
I don't know.

191
00:07:51,922 --> 00:07:54,066
Well, he can't go to the arcade
unless he's cleaned his room.

192
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:55,985
You know that, Ben.
I'm a grown-ass man,

193
00:07:56,009 --> 00:07:57,569
and I was there when
we made the rule.

194
00:07:57,594 --> 00:07:58,670
I don't need you to tell me...

195
00:07:58,694 --> 00:08:00,995
Well, apparently you
do because you're...

196
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:03,848
Okay, stop. Stop. Just stop.

197
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,835
Miranda...

198
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,423
Look at me.

199
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:13,492
Miranda, I...

200
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,637
You were mean.

201
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:16,410
This morning, you were mean.

202
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,112
I'm sorry.

203
00:08:18,181 --> 00:08:21,716
But this is just... This is
running over me like a truck.

204
00:08:21,785 --> 00:08:23,685
I feel... I know.

205
00:08:24,854 --> 00:08:25,937
Me, too.

206
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:29,924
Okay, so, we need
separate this out, um...

207
00:08:31,328 --> 00:08:34,329
The Chief and
Dr. Warren over here

208
00:08:34,397 --> 00:08:39,367
and Ben and Miranda over here.

209
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:42,903
Church and state, okay?

210
00:08:43,906 --> 00:08:45,941
Church and state.

211
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:50,729
Dr. Bailey, Omar
Singh's mother is here.

212
00:08:50,797 --> 00:08:52,130
Tell her I'll be right there.

213
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,499
Ben... I'll see you at home.

214
00:08:58,805 --> 00:09:01,088
Is home church or state?

215
00:09:02,526 --> 00:09:04,993
Church, I think.

216
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:20,670
Post-surgical hernias are
not actually all that uncommon,

217
00:09:20,694 --> 00:09:23,122
but given its size, we're gonna
need to do a special procedure

218
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:25,041
to close the gap
without tension on the...

219
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:26,447
What are you doing?

220
00:09:26,516 --> 00:09:27,716
Uh, I've gotten in the habit

221
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:30,167
of just sort of shoving
it all back in there.

222
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:31,686
Is that not okay?

223
00:09:32,622 --> 00:09:33,702
Um...

224
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:36,708
Hey.

225
00:09:36,777 --> 00:09:39,578
Um, Wilson, we
will be right back.

226
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:41,629
Come on.

227
00:09:44,601 --> 00:09:46,200
What are you doing?

228
00:09:46,269 --> 00:09:48,670
Wilson called for a plastics
consult for your CSR,

229
00:09:48,738 --> 00:09:51,072
which I obviously can't
do with you standing here,

230
00:09:51,157 --> 00:09:53,603
unless you want to violate the
terms of your own restraining order.

231
00:09:53,627 --> 00:09:54,959
I'm not...

232
00:09:55,028 --> 00:09:56,839
I'm not violating anything
because you're gonna go, okay?

233
00:09:56,863 --> 00:09:57,940
Just send someone else, please.

234
00:09:57,964 --> 00:09:59,598
Why don't we ask the patient?

235
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:01,561
He'd want a consult from the
best plastic surgeon in this hospital.

236
00:10:01,585 --> 00:10:02,962
You know that
this is just as much

237
00:10:02,986 --> 00:10:04,764
a general-surgery
case as it is a plastics.

238
00:10:04,788 --> 00:10:06,708
Right, and there are
plenty of general surgeons

239
00:10:06,756 --> 00:10:07,756
and only one of me.

240
00:10:07,823 --> 00:10:08,884
I was here first.

241
00:10:10,243 --> 00:10:11,343
Holy crap!

242
00:10:22,806 --> 00:10:24,846
You ignored the
moment completely.

243
00:10:24,908 --> 00:10:26,107
What moment?

244
00:10:26,176 --> 00:10:28,776
The moment where I
say, "Go to New York,"

245
00:10:28,845 --> 00:10:31,329
and then you ask me to
come to New York with you...

246
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:33,125
The moment. What?

247
00:10:33,149 --> 00:10:34,715
Wait.

248
00:10:34,784 --> 00:10:37,218
You didn't even want
me to meet your kid.

249
00:10:37,287 --> 00:10:39,987
No... You met my kid.
My kid loves you. It's fine...

250
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:42,340
Callie, you live
here in Seattle.

251
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:44,758
You... You have
family. You have a job.

252
00:10:44,827 --> 00:10:47,027
You can't just drop everything
and move to New York.

253
00:10:47,097 --> 00:10:48,762
I know, but still!

254
00:10:48,831 --> 00:10:49,897
Still what?

255
00:10:49,966 --> 00:10:52,384
It would have been
nice to have been asked.

256
00:10:57,423 --> 00:10:58,423
What?

257
00:10:59,175 --> 00:11:01,576
You are the

258
00:11:01,645 --> 00:11:04,763
most adorable woman
I've ever seen right now.

259
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,131
Really?

260
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:12,019
And, of course, I want you
to come to New York with me.

261
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:13,221
But it's impossible.

262
00:11:15,825 --> 00:11:19,310
There is, always,

263
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:20,995
long distance.

264
00:11:21,064 --> 00:11:23,530
Well, that's true.

265
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:25,599
Weekend trips.

266
00:11:28,805 --> 00:11:30,271
Dirty phone calls.

267
00:11:30,339 --> 00:11:31,579
Mmm. Mmm.

268
00:11:32,408 --> 00:11:34,608
Exactly how dirty?

269
00:11:36,662 --> 00:11:37,662
Mmm.

270
00:11:38,598 --> 00:11:39,976
Mmm. Mmm-hmm.

271
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,099
Oh, my God.

272
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,035
Oh, God!

273
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:47,455
Um, uh, I need a suture kit.

274
00:11:47,524 --> 00:11:49,686
No, you know what,
actually, I don't need it. Bye.

275
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:54,072
Guys, we can't go
back in time here.

276
00:11:54,096 --> 00:11:55,657
I mean, there's no way to know
how it would have turned out.

277
00:11:55,681 --> 00:11:57,343
I mean, I sure wouldn't have
opened her up in a hallway

278
00:11:57,367 --> 00:11:58,600
if I didn't have to,

279
00:11:58,668 --> 00:12:00,479
but Warren's saying that
he didn't have a choice.

280
00:12:00,503 --> 00:12:02,803
Except for those
doors... I mean...

281
00:12:02,872 --> 00:12:04,112
Yeah. The doors were open.

282
00:12:04,174 --> 00:12:05,739
How do you not see those doors?

283
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:07,025
And as for the baby?

284
00:12:07,093 --> 00:12:09,521
He was acidotic,
not oxygenating.

285
00:12:09,545 --> 00:12:11,357
We had to put him on ECMO.
Which was unsuccessful.

286
00:12:11,381 --> 00:12:13,981
That kind of perfusion can
be too much for smaller babies.

287
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:15,811
Riggs suggested
ECMO. We all agreed.

288
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:17,118
Wait. So, Riggs suggested it?

289
00:12:17,186 --> 00:12:18,653
Yeah.

290
00:12:18,721 --> 00:12:19,887
And you agreed with that?

291
00:12:19,956 --> 00:12:22,723
Well, I was worried, but
we were out of options.

292
00:12:22,792 --> 00:12:25,054
So, the ECMO that
Riggs suggested,

293
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:27,812
it exacerbated the problem?

294
00:12:27,881 --> 00:12:29,725
Like I said, we
were out of options.

295
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,449
Okay.

296
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:33,379
Well, I think that's all we
need from you guys. Thank you.

297
00:12:33,403 --> 00:12:34,569
Yeah. Sure thing.

298
00:12:34,637 --> 00:12:36,687
Thanks. Good luck.

299
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:40,453
Listen, we should
meet again tomorrow.

300
00:12:40,477 --> 00:12:42,693
With whom? We've
heard from everyone.

301
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,061
We haven't met with Riggs.

302
00:12:45,998 --> 00:12:47,665
Oh, my God. What?

303
00:12:47,734 --> 00:12:48,977
Nothing.

304
00:12:49,001 --> 00:12:50,446
What do you think
will happen to Warren?

305
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:51,602
Oh, I don't know.

306
00:12:51,671 --> 00:12:52,870
You're already leaving.

307
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:54,899
If he goes, too, they're
gonna work us to death.

308
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:57,052
Mmm, we're gonna
get all the surgeries.

309
00:12:57,076 --> 00:12:59,644
I mean, I feel bad, but
we gonna run this place.

310
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:01,490
Holy...

311
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:03,559
What is going on with your
phone? What are... Hey, stop!

312
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:05,127
Stop! No, no, no! What?

313
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,762
- Please give it back.
- Who's Kyle?

314
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:09,187
And why does he want to
do things with his tongue...

315
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:10,935
Answer the question.

316
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:12,974
Okay, come here.

317
00:13:13,043 --> 00:13:14,542
Please. Shut up.

318
00:13:14,611 --> 00:13:17,161
Okay, do you know
Shepherd's MS. patient?

319
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:18,262
Oh!

320
00:13:18,331 --> 00:13:19,497
Guitar Hero?

321
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:21,344
You are doing tongue
things with Guitar Hero?

322
00:13:21,368 --> 00:13:23,801
No. Not yet.

323
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:27,738
I told him maybe we would go
out when he got back from touring,

324
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:30,658
and so we've been texting,
and now he's melting my phone.

325
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:32,971
That's kind of hot,
and really dirty.

326
00:13:32,995 --> 00:13:34,840
Yeah. I call my
mother with this thing.

327
00:13:34,864 --> 00:13:36,759
Oh, God. Wow.

328
00:13:36,783 --> 00:13:37,948
Like this.

329
00:13:38,017 --> 00:13:39,695
How am I supposed
to respond to this?

330
00:13:39,719 --> 00:13:41,886
Oh, like this.

331
00:13:43,056 --> 00:13:44,296
Oh, my God!

332
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:46,441
Mmm.

333
00:13:46,509 --> 00:13:47,709
Thank you.

334
00:13:49,512 --> 00:13:51,179
Do you think you
can teach me that?

335
00:13:51,881 --> 00:13:53,081
Yeah.

336
00:13:54,851 --> 00:13:56,951
Your suture kit. I'm so sorry.

337
00:13:57,019 --> 00:13:58,886
It's fine.

338
00:13:58,955 --> 00:14:01,406
Um, I should have
knocked, I guess.

339
00:14:01,474 --> 00:14:03,508
She's leaving. Huh?

340
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:04,875
New York.

341
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:07,018
The Preminger Grant.

342
00:14:09,499 --> 00:14:12,049
I'm so sorry. But, you
know, I don't know.

343
00:14:12,118 --> 00:14:13,963
I mean, that doesn't
mean that it has to be over.

344
00:14:13,987 --> 00:14:16,187
Long-distance relationships
aren't impossible.

345
00:14:16,256 --> 00:14:18,201
Yeah, I don't know if we
can survive long distance.

346
00:14:18,225 --> 00:14:20,891
I'm so afraid that
it'll all fall apart.

347
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,527
Then don't let it.

348
00:14:22,596 --> 00:14:25,863
I mean, decide you want it
to work and make it happen.

349
00:14:25,932 --> 00:14:28,052
It's New York. It's
a six-hour flight.

350
00:14:28,101 --> 00:14:29,633
It's weekends and phone calls.

351
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:31,942
You can figure it out.
You will. You... You should.

352
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:35,850
Thanks. Mmm.

353
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:37,737
Hey, Callie. Yeah?

354
00:14:37,761 --> 00:14:39,037
Maybe next time,
like, an on-call room,

355
00:14:39,061 --> 00:14:40,661
something with, like,
a lock on the door.

356
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:44,009
You stole my patient?

357
00:14:44,033 --> 00:14:45,649
He's my patient, all right?

358
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:46,946
And you should
probably step back about,

359
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:48,080
I don't know, 100 feet.

360
00:14:48,104 --> 00:14:49,344
All right, now.

361
00:14:49,372 --> 00:14:50,999
This man needs
a plastic surgeon.

362
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:52,023
And a general surgeon.

363
00:14:52,092 --> 00:14:53,357
Which is why Dr. Webber

364
00:14:53,426 --> 00:14:54,954
is going to be scrubbing
in with me, all right?

365
00:14:54,978 --> 00:14:56,489
I'm the head of Plastics.
I have seniority here.

366
00:14:56,513 --> 00:14:57,962
So, I'm not gonna step down

367
00:14:58,031 --> 00:14:59,808
just because you decided
to file a restraining order.

368
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:02,583
This... This is not...
Okay, you know... Okay.

369
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:04,385
Now, that's enough.

370
00:15:04,454 --> 00:15:06,499
Now, this patient isn't
gonna get less than our best

371
00:15:06,523 --> 00:15:09,234
because the two of you are not
allowed to be in the same room.

372
00:15:09,258 --> 00:15:10,725
I'm scrubbing in with Avery.

373
00:15:10,794 --> 00:15:11,914
End of discussion.

374
00:15:16,932 --> 00:15:18,399
I'm free tomorrow after 4:00.

375
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:26,357
So, he may never wake up again?

376
00:15:27,243 --> 00:15:28,609
He did wake up,

377
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:30,478
but then he suffered
a prolonged seizure.

378
00:15:30,546 --> 00:15:32,679
He may have been
oxygen-deprived.

379
00:15:32,748 --> 00:15:34,493
We're still trying
to figure out why.

380
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:36,033
But you should know,

381
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:38,748
reviewing his most recent
scans, there's not much activity.

382
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:41,872
They suggest he may have
suffered severe damage.

383
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:45,776
So, even if he did wake up
now, we're not sure what's left.

384
00:15:45,845 --> 00:15:48,007
Your son didn't
have a directive.

385
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:50,364
These forms will determine

386
00:15:50,433 --> 00:15:53,234
whether you want us to
try and resuscitate Omar

387
00:15:53,302 --> 00:15:55,336
if his heart fails.

388
00:15:58,558 --> 00:16:00,686
I don't know what to do.

389
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:02,487
It's a very difficult decision.

390
00:16:02,511 --> 00:16:05,380
No, he's my baby.

391
00:16:05,448 --> 00:16:08,332
I can still remember
how it felt to hold him.

392
00:16:08,401 --> 00:16:10,384
I can't just...

393
00:16:10,453 --> 00:16:11,969
I don't know what to do.

394
00:16:12,038 --> 00:16:13,770
What do I do?

395
00:16:16,543 --> 00:16:19,544
You should sign the papers.

396
00:16:19,612 --> 00:16:21,812
Daddy wouldn't
want to live in a bed

397
00:16:21,881 --> 00:16:23,780
connected to machines

398
00:16:23,849 --> 00:16:26,600
with his eyes
closed all the time.

399
00:16:26,669 --> 00:16:27,985
He would hate it.

400
00:16:28,054 --> 00:16:31,088
And he would...

401
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,480
He would want to be with Mommy.

402
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:55,229
I need a pen.

403
00:17:03,506 --> 00:17:05,739
We love you, Daddy.

404
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:17,234
Any change? No.

405
00:17:17,303 --> 00:17:18,452
How'd the Warren thing go?

406
00:17:18,521 --> 00:17:20,115
- It's still going.
- It shouldn't be.

407
00:17:20,139 --> 00:17:22,056
This is just Owen
being pissed at Riggs.

408
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:23,886
I mean, I get that there's
bad blood there, but...

409
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:25,709
Well, it's really bad blood.

410
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:27,578
Owen only ever
told me headlines,

411
00:17:27,647 --> 00:17:29,380
and I had to drag it out of him.

412
00:17:29,449 --> 00:17:31,026
It was impossible
to get him to talk.

413
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,544
Probably because
you were talking.

414
00:17:32,568 --> 00:17:34,334
Uncool. Be nice.

415
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:38,617
Yeah, and you know Riggs
cheated on Owen's sister.

416
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:40,291
What? What?

417
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:43,339
That's why she got on the
helicopter, and disappeared

418
00:17:43,363 --> 00:17:44,603
because she was leaving him.

419
00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:47,181
Still, it's old business.

420
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:48,994
And he lied about
it right to my face.

421
00:17:49,018 --> 00:17:50,584
He made up some sad story

422
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:53,521
about how he tried to stop her
from getting on the helicopter,

423
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:57,758
but she had to save a
patient, and he had no choice.

424
00:17:57,827 --> 00:17:59,622
He made himself
look pretty good.

425
00:17:59,646 --> 00:18:01,545
Wow. That's...

426
00:18:01,614 --> 00:18:03,547
Psychotic. I agree.

427
00:18:03,616 --> 00:18:06,336
So, Owen does not trust him,
and I'm not inclined to, either.

428
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:08,997
Heart rate's dropping.

429
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:10,371
I'll get a crash cart.

430
00:18:10,439 --> 00:18:12,423
No, no, wait. He's DNR. Yeah.

431
00:18:33,062 --> 00:18:34,795
I hate this part.

432
00:18:41,237 --> 00:18:42,237
Mer?

433
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,072
Bailey will want to know.

434
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,686
You didn't wake me.

435
00:18:59,756 --> 00:19:01,255
Where are my keys?

436
00:19:01,323 --> 00:19:03,035
Why didn't you wake me?
Have you seen my keys?

437
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:04,658
They... I got called in.

438
00:19:04,727 --> 00:19:07,394
Yeah, which is why I want to
know why you didn't wake me.

439
00:19:07,463 --> 00:19:09,696
I had them in my hand
when I walked in the door...

440
00:19:09,766 --> 00:19:12,466
I wake you. You wake
me. That's the rule.

441
00:19:12,534 --> 00:19:14,079
You get paged in the
middle of the night,

442
00:19:14,103 --> 00:19:16,570
you wake the other person.

443
00:19:16,639 --> 00:19:20,440
You wake me so I
know to listen for Tuck,

444
00:19:20,509 --> 00:19:22,009
so I know not to
rush out of here

445
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:23,677
for the hospital in the morning

446
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:26,291
thinking you did the morning
thing and just had an early surgery,

447
00:19:26,315 --> 00:19:29,516
so I don't leave our child in
the house asleep in his bed

448
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:31,529
when I should be waking
him, making him breakfast

449
00:19:31,553 --> 00:19:32,653
and taking him to school

450
00:19:32,721 --> 00:19:34,255
because that's my job,

451
00:19:34,323 --> 00:19:37,291
because that's the rule,
because that's what happens,

452
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:40,727
because when you get
paged, you wake me.

453
00:19:40,797 --> 00:19:42,391
Would you stop looking
for the damn keys

454
00:19:42,415 --> 00:19:44,231
and tell me why you
didn't wake me, Miranda?

455
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:45,816
Omar is dying,

456
00:19:45,885 --> 00:19:47,985
and while you stand
there and yell at me,

457
00:19:48,054 --> 00:19:50,081
three children are
becoming orphans.

458
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:51,538
I did not wake you

459
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:54,141
because I didn't want
to talk to you right now.

460
00:19:59,048 --> 00:20:00,063
Keys.

461
00:20:10,726 --> 00:20:12,366
That was...

462
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:14,311
Seriously, you have skills.

463
00:20:14,363 --> 00:20:16,408
I don't work alone.

464
00:20:16,432 --> 00:20:18,282
Teamwork.

465
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,153
I don't, though, work alone.

466
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,272
I'm gonna be
miserable without you.

467
00:20:30,612 --> 00:20:32,095
You never asked me to stay.

468
00:20:36,719 --> 00:20:37,719
I can't.

469
00:20:42,358 --> 00:20:43,358
Penny...

470
00:20:46,195 --> 00:20:47,728
Penny, I want you to stay.

471
00:20:47,797 --> 00:20:51,065
I would give anything
for you to stay.

472
00:20:51,134 --> 00:20:53,167
But I know better than to ask.

473
00:20:53,236 --> 00:20:55,152
I have been here before.

474
00:20:55,221 --> 00:20:58,422
This is the beginning of a
whole new adventure for you.

475
00:20:58,491 --> 00:21:00,669
I could never ask
you to give that up.

476
00:21:00,693 --> 00:21:01,933
I love you too much.

477
00:21:03,663 --> 00:21:04,663
You...

478
00:21:05,381 --> 00:21:06,747
I love you.

479
00:21:11,837 --> 00:21:13,304
Hey.

480
00:21:13,372 --> 00:21:15,206
No, no, don't cry.

481
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:21,278
I love you.

482
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:25,015
And you love me.

483
00:21:25,084 --> 00:21:27,351
And now I have to go all
the way across the country

484
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:29,019
to save lives...

485
00:21:29,088 --> 00:21:33,724
Which sounds really noble,
like in some movie, but...

486
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:37,177
Actually, it just really sucks.

487
00:21:51,877 --> 00:21:53,444
Penny...

488
00:21:54,981 --> 00:21:56,713
It's the moment again.

489
00:21:59,135 --> 00:22:00,734
The moment.

490
00:22:03,706 --> 00:22:05,106
Ask me.

491
00:22:06,209 --> 00:22:07,608
Go ahead.

492
00:22:08,711 --> 00:22:10,410
Ask me.

493
00:22:16,986 --> 00:22:18,597
Sofia, get those
teeth brushed, missy!

494
00:22:18,621 --> 00:22:20,701
I want to hit the road
in about 10 minutes!

495
00:22:21,624 --> 00:22:23,769
Hi. Something is
wrong with the baby...

496
00:22:23,793 --> 00:22:25,525
Really, horribly wrong.

497
00:22:25,595 --> 00:22:26,835
Wrong? Wrong how?

498
00:22:26,896 --> 00:22:29,580
I was driving to the hospital,

499
00:22:29,648 --> 00:22:32,183
and, um, I got so scared
that I couldn't breathe,

500
00:22:32,251 --> 00:22:34,451
and your place is
closer, so I just...

501
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,764
What... Hold on, April. Slow
down. Tell me what's going on.

502
00:22:36,788 --> 00:22:38,005
Jackson was right, wasn't he,

503
00:22:38,074 --> 00:22:40,040
that I was wrong to not check?

504
00:22:41,761 --> 00:22:42,788
Okay, hey... I can't!

505
00:22:42,812 --> 00:22:44,978
Arizona, I cannot do this again.

506
00:22:45,064 --> 00:22:46,296
I can't.

507
00:22:51,003 --> 00:22:52,698
Ooh, you are being
such a good little helper.

508
00:22:52,722 --> 00:22:54,199
Let's walk a little
faster, though, okay?

509
00:22:54,223 --> 00:22:56,090
Oh, Andrew!

510
00:22:56,158 --> 00:22:57,836
Andrew's gonna show you where
all the best coloring books are, okay?

511
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:58,971
I am? Yeah.

512
00:22:58,995 --> 00:23:00,411
Okay. Come on.

513
00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:02,796
I refused the ultrasound.

514
00:23:02,865 --> 00:23:05,043
I needed this baby
to be healthy so badly,

515
00:23:05,067 --> 00:23:06,878
- and now, if I caused this...
- Okay, okay. It's okay.

516
00:23:06,902 --> 00:23:08,080
If we could have
prevented this...

517
00:23:08,104 --> 00:23:09,314
All right, let's
just take a look.

518
00:23:09,338 --> 00:23:11,578
Let's take a look,
okay? Okay, okay, okay.

519
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:14,191
There.

520
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:16,777
There's the little one. Oh!

521
00:23:16,846 --> 00:23:19,579
That's... That's it.
That's the feeling.

522
00:23:19,649 --> 00:23:20,859
What is that? What is that?

523
00:23:20,883 --> 00:23:22,700
That's your baby moving.

524
00:23:23,452 --> 00:23:25,118
Look.

525
00:23:25,187 --> 00:23:27,905
Very strong fetal heartbeat.

526
00:23:30,643 --> 00:23:32,542
That's the baby moving?

527
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:35,863
Samuel never...

528
00:23:35,932 --> 00:23:38,749
I know. You've
never felt this before.

529
00:23:38,818 --> 00:23:41,430
I'm gonna check the cervical
length just because of the cramping,

530
00:23:41,454 --> 00:23:44,671
but I am confident
that this is just

531
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:47,140
what a healthy baby feels like.

532
00:23:48,744 --> 00:23:49,805
<i>Advisory panel?</i>

533
00:23:49,829 --> 00:23:51,829
The situation
seemed fairly clear.

534
00:23:51,898 --> 00:23:55,632
Well, that doesn't make deciding
disciplinary action any easier.

535
00:23:55,701 --> 00:23:57,401
I suppose.

536
00:23:59,272 --> 00:24:01,272
What if it were you and me?

537
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:03,473
Would it be so easy for
you to make that decision?

538
00:24:03,542 --> 00:24:05,876
You and I would never
be in this situation.

539
00:24:05,945 --> 00:24:07,611
Well, you never know.

540
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,080
Yes, I do, 'cause if you
did something like this,

541
00:24:10,149 --> 00:24:12,916
I'd just strangle you
with my bare hands.

542
00:24:12,985 --> 00:24:14,796
I wouldn't be
the one to do this.

543
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,136
I'm talking about you.

544
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:18,572
Oh, please, please.

545
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,800
This is all of it, I think.

546
00:24:20,576 --> 00:24:21,875
All of what?

547
00:24:21,944 --> 00:24:23,824
Well, I got joint purchases,
marriage license,

548
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,546
post-nup, divorce decree.

549
00:24:26,615 --> 00:24:27,759
Our attorneys asked Jackson

550
00:24:27,783 --> 00:24:28,960
to put together
whatever he could

551
00:24:28,984 --> 00:24:32,852
to help create a
timeline, a paper trail.

552
00:24:32,922 --> 00:24:34,437
Do you have to do this now?

553
00:24:34,506 --> 00:24:36,746
Yeah, I got to get it back to
him by the end of the week.

554
00:24:37,877 --> 00:24:40,477
Well, I'll leave
you to it, then.

555
00:24:40,546 --> 00:24:42,662
Oh, and thanks again,
sir, for yesterday.

556
00:24:42,732 --> 00:24:43,932
Appreciate you backing me up.

557
00:24:43,966 --> 00:24:45,206
I didn't back you up.

558
00:24:45,268 --> 00:24:47,246
I backed up a patient
whose doctors couldn't

559
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:49,510
get it together long
enough to do their damn job.

560
00:24:51,557 --> 00:24:53,685
The baby was in
respiratory failure

561
00:24:53,709 --> 00:24:55,837
despite maximal
ventilatory support.

562
00:24:55,861 --> 00:24:58,629
He fit the criteria, so
ECMO was the only option.

563
00:24:58,698 --> 00:24:59,996
I agree.

564
00:25:00,065 --> 00:25:01,065
All right?

565
00:25:01,133 --> 00:25:02,733
What was his oxidation index?

566
00:25:02,801 --> 00:25:06,453
Around 45 for at least
20 minutes. Okay.

567
00:25:06,522 --> 00:25:09,606
And you used
aggressive resuscitation?

568
00:25:09,675 --> 00:25:11,342
Yeah, of course.

569
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:13,538
They tried to clear his
metabolic acidosis with fluids,

570
00:25:13,562 --> 00:25:15,829
but he had a pH of...

571
00:25:15,898 --> 00:25:17,614
I mean, I can pull the chart.

572
00:25:17,683 --> 00:25:19,232
We have the chart.

573
00:25:19,302 --> 00:25:20,817
So, what is this about?

574
00:25:20,887 --> 00:25:23,487
This is about Dr. Warren.

575
00:25:23,555 --> 00:25:24,915
Thank you,
Dr. Riggs. You can go.

576
00:25:25,241 --> 00:25:26,906
Sure.

577
00:25:26,976 --> 00:25:28,442
This was fun.

578
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:32,245
So, if Riggs' recommendation
killed the baby,

579
00:25:32,314 --> 00:25:33,547
then we should...

580
00:25:33,616 --> 00:25:35,293
I would have made the same call.

581
00:25:35,317 --> 00:25:37,161
There was nothing else
left to do. We don't know that.

582
00:25:37,185 --> 00:25:39,686
Okay, we need to bring
this back to the point

583
00:25:39,755 --> 00:25:42,122
because you have, frankly,
been wasting my time

584
00:25:42,191 --> 00:25:43,741
on a needless witch hunt.

585
00:25:43,809 --> 00:25:46,309
This is not about Dr. Riggs,
and it is not about you.

586
00:25:46,379 --> 00:25:50,114
The point here is to
answer one question,

587
00:25:50,182 --> 00:25:53,600
do we think Ben Warren
is telling us the truth?

588
00:25:54,202 --> 00:25:55,568
So let's answer it.

589
00:25:55,638 --> 00:25:57,537
His blood pressure
keeps dropping,

590
00:25:57,623 --> 00:26:00,223
and his heart rate
is all over the place.

591
00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:03,393
Well, it's been hours,

592
00:26:03,462 --> 00:26:05,963
and he hasn't had any
further seizure activity.

593
00:26:06,032 --> 00:26:09,233
We could give him
medication to control his heart,

594
00:26:09,302 --> 00:26:10,545
and fluid to boost his pressure.

595
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:11,901
No.

596
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:13,210
Mrs. Singh?

597
00:26:19,662 --> 00:26:21,261
He's gone.

598
00:26:23,198 --> 00:26:25,482
My son is gone.

599
00:26:38,697 --> 00:26:40,331
Is Omar...

600
00:26:42,134 --> 00:26:43,634
Is he gone?

601
00:26:45,588 --> 00:26:47,755
You can tell me that.

602
00:26:52,227 --> 00:26:53,467
We're still waiting.

603
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:03,270
Church?

604
00:27:21,823 --> 00:27:22,956
State.

605
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:35,986
So, did you find
something new or...

606
00:27:36,055 --> 00:27:38,489
Warren, we need
you to tell us why.

607
00:27:39,024 --> 00:27:40,064
Why what?

608
00:27:40,092 --> 00:27:42,942
Why, when the
elevator doors opened,

609
00:27:43,011 --> 00:27:44,644
you chose to ignore it...

610
00:27:44,713 --> 00:27:46,057
I have told you and told you...

611
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:47,914
And cut open Gretchen
McKay, anyway.

612
00:27:47,983 --> 00:27:49,223
That I did not make a choice!

613
00:27:49,851 --> 00:27:51,091
I wasn't given one.

614
00:27:51,153 --> 00:27:54,432
I was forced to use the
knowledge and resources I had

615
00:27:54,456 --> 00:27:56,990
to fulfill the oath I
took to save her life...

616
00:27:57,059 --> 00:27:58,525
Because the door didn't open.

617
00:27:58,594 --> 00:28:00,038
No, it did. It clearly did.

618
00:28:00,062 --> 00:28:02,546
I'm saying I didn't
see it happen.

619
00:28:05,384 --> 00:28:07,329
I just don't understand
how you didn't see it happen.

620
00:28:07,353 --> 00:28:09,686
You do. You know.
You should know.

621
00:28:10,756 --> 00:28:12,422
You're surgeons.

622
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:15,476
You know what it's like. You...

623
00:28:15,561 --> 00:28:17,293
When you operate,

624
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:20,063
when you control if a person
breathes another breath, when...

625
00:28:20,132 --> 00:28:22,699
When you hold their
beating heart in your hand,

626
00:28:22,768 --> 00:28:26,737
when you are
responsible for that life,

627
00:28:26,805 --> 00:28:32,959
you don't see or hear
or feel anything else.

628
00:28:35,981 --> 00:28:39,116
The rest of the
world just disappears.

629
00:28:41,454 --> 00:28:42,953
You know that.

630
00:28:44,656 --> 00:28:46,022
You all do.

631
00:28:47,626 --> 00:28:49,759
You can't tell me you don't.

632
00:28:56,218 --> 00:28:57,784
Okay. What's happening?

633
00:28:57,853 --> 00:29:00,470
He's having runs of
v-tach. I think he's going.

634
00:29:00,539 --> 00:29:03,089
His mom just took the
kids down for lunch, too. I...

635
00:29:03,159 --> 00:29:05,542
Should I bring her back up here?

636
00:29:07,346 --> 00:29:08,426
Chief?

637
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,180
Crash cart. What?

638
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:12,127
Yeah. I need a crash
cart in here now!

639
00:29:12,151 --> 00:29:13,483
Start CPR.

640
00:29:13,552 --> 00:29:16,102
Oh, Dr. Bailey, I don't
think we're supposed to.

641
00:29:16,172 --> 00:29:17,971
Okay, push an amp of epi.

642
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,684
What is this? Uh,
Dr. Shepherd, I...

643
00:29:19,708 --> 00:29:21,007
Bailey, what are we doing?

644
00:29:21,093 --> 00:29:22,576
Okay. Good. Charge to 100.

645
00:29:22,645 --> 00:29:24,511
Mmm-mmm. Isn't he
supposed to be DNR?

646
00:29:24,579 --> 00:29:25,878
Yes. His mother agreed.

647
00:29:25,947 --> 00:29:27,180
Clear!

648
00:29:30,452 --> 00:29:33,403
Okay, charge to 150,
and get that epi on board.

649
00:29:33,472 --> 00:29:35,753
Bailey, we told his mother
we would not resuscitate.

650
00:29:37,142 --> 00:29:38,175
Clear!

651
00:29:41,213 --> 00:29:42,893
200! Bailey!

652
00:30:00,966 --> 00:30:02,632
His heart stopped?

653
00:30:04,003 --> 00:30:05,235
Yes, it did,

654
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:07,237
but only just for a
second, and then...

655
00:30:07,306 --> 00:30:09,739
You decided to resuscitate.

656
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:12,242
But I signed those papers.

657
00:30:12,311 --> 00:30:14,794
Jasmine and I, we
made a decision.

658
00:30:14,863 --> 00:30:16,796
Yes, I know.

659
00:30:16,865 --> 00:30:19,383
I wanted to give him
one more chance.

660
00:30:19,435 --> 00:30:21,768
So you think there's still hope?

661
00:30:22,671 --> 00:30:24,003
I don't understand.

662
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:27,218
Just yesterday, we were
discussing brain damage.

663
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:29,325
Chief, a word.

664
00:30:38,904 --> 00:30:42,639
Bailey, just explain
what you are thinking.

665
00:30:42,708 --> 00:30:44,724
My patient has a signed DNR.

666
00:30:46,194 --> 00:30:48,828
The patient deserves a chance.

667
00:30:51,033 --> 00:30:53,066
His family deserves

668
00:30:53,135 --> 00:30:55,335
for this hospital to
respect their wishes.

669
00:30:55,403 --> 00:30:56,770
Shepherd...

670
00:30:56,839 --> 00:30:58,271
It is not fair

671
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:00,351
to make a patient suffer so
that Warren doesn't have to.

672
00:31:00,375 --> 00:31:02,215
You know that.
Dr. Shepherd, watch yourself.

673
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:18,475
You were right, and thank you.

674
00:31:18,544 --> 00:31:21,111
I love being right.
What was I right about?

675
00:31:21,163 --> 00:31:23,229
Penny. We figured it out.

676
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:24,359
Oh, yay. Yeah.

677
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:25,665
Yeah, no, Sofia was saying...

678
00:31:25,734 --> 00:31:26,933
I can totally go with her.

679
00:31:27,002 --> 00:31:28,680
What? No. It seemed impossible

680
00:31:28,704 --> 00:31:30,882
until I really, really looked
at it, but it's not impossible.

681
00:31:30,906 --> 00:31:31,972
It's an adventure.

682
00:31:32,674 --> 00:31:33,914
You're kidding.

683
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:35,736
Are you kidding? I
know. It's crazy, right?

684
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,105
But I can get a job
anywhere out there,

685
00:31:37,129 --> 00:31:38,573
and probably with
new research money,

686
00:31:38,597 --> 00:31:40,141
and I have colleagues out
there who can help me get...

687
00:31:40,165 --> 00:31:41,342
Wait. Yeah, no, but you...

688
00:31:41,366 --> 00:31:42,810
Well, you have a
daughter. Yeah. No. I know.

689
00:31:42,834 --> 00:31:44,078
It's a lot to
figure out, I know.

690
00:31:44,102 --> 00:31:45,497
But you were right,
it can be figured out.

691
00:31:45,521 --> 00:31:46,887
It's a six-hour flight,

692
00:31:46,955 --> 00:31:48,700
and you'll be able to see
Sofia whenever you want.

693
00:31:48,724 --> 00:31:50,039
And we'll figure it out, right?

694
00:31:50,108 --> 00:31:53,443
Oh, crap. Um, so, we
will talk about it, okay?

695
00:31:53,511 --> 00:31:55,745
But just thank you.

696
00:31:59,067 --> 00:32:01,601
Every surgeon who worked
on Mrs. McKay and the baby

697
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:03,887
said the same thing,
including Dr. Warren.

698
00:32:03,956 --> 00:32:06,418
That they were backed into a
corner and they didn't have a choice.

699
00:32:06,442 --> 00:32:07,952
The only difference with Warren

700
00:32:07,976 --> 00:32:09,437
is whether or not
you think he's lying,

701
00:32:09,461 --> 00:32:11,628
whether you believe he
didn't see that door open.

702
00:32:11,696 --> 00:32:14,063
And do you think he was lying?

703
00:32:14,132 --> 00:32:15,882
No. We don't.

704
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:18,985
We believe Warren
missed the door.

705
00:32:19,054 --> 00:32:21,054
We believe he was
completely focused

706
00:32:21,122 --> 00:32:23,557
on his responsibility
to the patient.

707
00:32:28,314 --> 00:32:30,713
Well, thank you all.

708
00:32:30,783 --> 00:32:31,783
Mmm-hmm.

709
00:32:39,358 --> 00:32:41,624
Sounds like they feel he tried.

710
00:32:41,693 --> 00:32:43,733
And yet two people
are still dead.

711
00:32:46,898 --> 00:32:48,798
What are you gonna do?

712
00:32:51,887 --> 00:32:53,887
Six months?

713
00:32:53,955 --> 00:32:55,889
No surgery for six months?

714
00:32:55,957 --> 00:32:58,107
Uh, to be clear, it's a
six-month suspension

715
00:32:58,177 --> 00:33:00,026
from the residency program.

716
00:33:00,095 --> 00:33:01,239
I'm suspended from the hospital?

717
00:33:01,263 --> 00:33:02,340
Yes.

718
00:33:02,364 --> 00:33:04,163
How do you...

719
00:33:04,233 --> 00:33:07,183
Do you have any idea
how far behind I'll fall?

720
00:33:07,252 --> 00:33:08,368
I'll never get caught up.

721
00:33:08,436 --> 00:33:10,336
What am I supposed
to learn from this?

722
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:15,074
Do you feel even
the slightest remorse?

723
00:33:15,143 --> 00:33:16,843
Yes. Yes!

724
00:33:16,912 --> 00:33:20,013
How can you ask me
that? Of course I do!

725
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:22,382
All I do is play it over
again in my mind,

726
00:33:22,451 --> 00:33:24,145
trying to figure out
how I could change it!

727
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:26,669
Of course I do.

728
00:33:26,738 --> 00:33:29,606
But six months,
it's not discipline.

729
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:31,119
For a surgeon, that's
a death sentence.

730
00:33:31,143 --> 00:33:32,358
I might as well drop out now.

731
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:38,631
That's all, Dr. Warren.

732
00:33:40,885 --> 00:33:43,386
I tried to save her the
only way I know how.

733
00:33:43,455 --> 00:33:45,222
You... They know that, right?

734
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:46,890
You know that.

735
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:17,821
Sofia.

736
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:18,922
Hi!

737
00:34:23,445 --> 00:34:24,510
Hi.

738
00:34:24,579 --> 00:34:25,656
You ready? You ready?

739
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:26,746
Let's go.

740
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:30,816
Oh, thank you.

741
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:35,004
Get inside!

742
00:34:36,124 --> 00:34:38,190
Pierce, before you go,

743
00:34:38,259 --> 00:34:40,444
Tacoma wants to send a
patient with failed stenting.

744
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:42,378
Emergency four-vessel bypass.

745
00:34:42,448 --> 00:34:45,060
I didn't want to authorize it
until I'd checked it with you, but...

746
00:34:45,084 --> 00:34:47,429
Uh, well, is the patient
stable enough to transfer?

747
00:34:47,453 --> 00:34:48,851
As far I'm concerned, yes.

748
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,787
Okay, yeah. Go ahead.

749
00:34:52,174 --> 00:34:53,189
What?

750
00:34:54,776 --> 00:34:56,927
Nothing. Nothing.

751
00:34:56,995 --> 00:34:59,128
What did Owen tell you about me?

752
00:35:00,198 --> 00:35:01,647
Meredith. She said, um...

753
00:35:02,984 --> 00:35:05,363
She's my sister,
and she told me...

754
00:35:05,387 --> 00:35:07,821
She told you about Megan.

755
00:35:07,889 --> 00:35:11,090
Why would you lie
about something like that?

756
00:35:11,159 --> 00:35:14,311
You know, I shouldn't have
asked. This isn't any of my business.

757
00:35:14,379 --> 00:35:17,247
And I'm not usually
a person who...

758
00:35:17,315 --> 00:35:19,577
You don't owe me an
explanation, obviously,

759
00:35:19,601 --> 00:35:22,702
but you're a good guy

760
00:35:22,771 --> 00:35:25,337
and a great
surgeon, and I just...

761
00:35:28,009 --> 00:35:29,626
Why?

762
00:35:29,694 --> 00:35:31,361
I didn't lie to Meredith.

763
00:35:33,147 --> 00:35:34,498
It's fine. Forget it.

764
00:35:36,167 --> 00:35:38,647
Look, everything
I told her was true.

765
00:35:38,703 --> 00:35:40,470
There was a patient.

766
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,740
There was a helicopter.

767
00:35:46,011 --> 00:35:47,928
I just left some parts out.

768
00:35:48,913 --> 00:35:50,797
The part where we fought,

769
00:35:51,616 --> 00:35:54,551
where I cheated,

770
00:35:54,619 --> 00:35:56,986
where I failed the best
person I've ever met,

771
00:35:57,055 --> 00:36:00,289
the only woman I've ever loved.

772
00:36:00,359 --> 00:36:02,392
And those parts are
for me and Megan.

773
00:36:02,461 --> 00:36:04,460
You're right. I don't
owe anyone that.

774
00:36:07,615 --> 00:36:10,716
I made a mistake.

775
00:36:12,988 --> 00:36:15,688
A big one.

776
00:36:15,757 --> 00:36:19,960
And I've paid for it ever since.

777
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:23,329
Okay?

778
00:36:24,683 --> 00:36:25,683
Okay.

779
00:36:40,014 --> 00:36:42,816
I'm glad you're being
strong about this.

780
00:36:42,884 --> 00:36:44,784
I know how hard this is.

781
00:36:44,853 --> 00:36:47,119
I know how bad you feel.

782
00:36:47,188 --> 00:36:48,888
You loved this person once.

783
00:36:48,957 --> 00:36:50,256
There's a child involved.

784
00:36:51,793 --> 00:36:53,960
But I'm gonna tell you,

785
00:36:54,028 --> 00:36:57,096
the one thing that all custody
cases have in common

786
00:36:57,165 --> 00:37:00,132
is that they are
always a battle.

787
00:37:00,201 --> 00:37:03,302
And no matter
what, even if you win,

788
00:37:03,371 --> 00:37:07,006
you will still feel like
you lost something.

789
00:37:07,075 --> 00:37:10,093
So, are you sure this is
a battle you want to fight?

790
00:37:10,161 --> 00:37:12,481
My ex-wife wants to
move across the country

791
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:15,364
and take our daughter, so...

792
00:37:15,433 --> 00:37:16,633
Yeah.

793
00:37:20,939 --> 00:37:22,171
Hey.

794
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,240
Stop.

795
00:37:23,308 --> 00:37:24,808
No. No more, okay?

796
00:37:24,876 --> 00:37:26,287
I'm done. Just stay
away from me. All right.

797
00:37:26,311 --> 00:37:28,188
Look, I'm not gonna
come any closer, okay?

798
00:37:28,212 --> 00:37:29,590
I just need to talk to you.
I need to say something.

799
00:37:29,614 --> 00:37:30,691
I need you to hear me.

800
00:37:30,715 --> 00:37:32,281
Please?

801
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:34,617
Fine.

802
00:37:34,686 --> 00:37:37,046
All right, I have been
going over the paperwork,

803
00:37:37,071 --> 00:37:39,733
you know, for the lawyer, the
prenup, post-nup, whatever.

804
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:41,269
You know, I just...
I don't need this.

805
00:37:41,293 --> 00:37:44,505
At first glance, it was
actually really frustrating,

806
00:37:44,529 --> 00:37:46,006
you know, 'cause I
wasn't finding anything

807
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:47,224
that was actually
gonna help my case.

808
00:37:47,248 --> 00:37:48,882
It was just so fair.

809
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:50,945
And I realized that was
because it was written

810
00:37:50,969 --> 00:37:56,105
by two people who
really loved each other...

811
00:37:56,174 --> 00:37:58,254
Two people who really
wanted to protect each other,

812
00:37:58,310 --> 00:38:00,710
who really wanted what
was best for each other.

813
00:38:00,779 --> 00:38:03,045
And, April, I...

814
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:05,434
I don't know where
those people went.

815
00:38:06,618 --> 00:38:08,963
I don't know if we
can fix us, April.

816
00:38:08,987 --> 00:38:10,620
I don't know if we should.

817
00:38:10,689 --> 00:38:14,323
But I know I don't like
who I am turning into.

818
00:38:16,477 --> 00:38:18,295
I don't want to treat you...

819
00:38:21,566 --> 00:38:25,468
This person who wrote
this, who signed this,

820
00:38:26,738 --> 00:38:28,772
was your best friend.

821
00:38:29,641 --> 00:38:31,801
You were my best friend, April.

822
00:38:33,044 --> 00:38:35,278
My favorite person.

823
00:38:37,549 --> 00:38:42,852
And I realized that that's
who I should be dealing with.

824
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:46,489
We should treat each other
the way we did on this paper.

825
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:04,674
You want to feel something
unbelievably awesome?

826
00:39:06,778 --> 00:39:08,277
Oh.

827
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:10,847
Was that a kick? Yeah.

828
00:39:10,915 --> 00:39:12,248
He's kicking?

829
00:39:12,316 --> 00:39:14,433
Or, she's kicking.

830
00:39:14,502 --> 00:39:16,269
This baby can kick?

831
00:39:18,657 --> 00:39:21,374
Our baby can kick.

832
00:39:21,443 --> 00:39:23,483
Oh, he did it again.

833
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:29,982
Why are you still here?

834
00:39:30,051 --> 00:39:31,891
You have to go back
to them. You have to...

835
00:39:31,953 --> 00:39:33,898
Hunt, and this committee. You
have to get them to reconsider.

836
00:39:33,922 --> 00:39:37,389
There's... They have
nothing to reconsider.

837
00:39:37,459 --> 00:39:39,191
They made a
recommendation. I made a call.

838
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:41,472
It's very simple, and I'm
done talking about this here.

839
00:39:41,496 --> 00:39:42,895
Church and state.

840
00:39:42,964 --> 00:39:44,658
There's a reason that it's
separated. To hell with state!

841
00:39:44,682 --> 00:39:46,093
You're really gonna
come back at me

842
00:39:46,117 --> 00:39:48,317
with "no special
treatment"? Six months is...

843
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:50,754
Six months is special treatment!

844
00:39:50,822 --> 00:39:52,122
What?

845
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:54,273
If you had been anyone else,

846
00:39:54,342 --> 00:39:55,809
you wouldn't have
been suspended.

847
00:39:55,877 --> 00:39:57,343
You would have been fired.

848
00:39:57,412 --> 00:39:58,762
They told you to fire me?

849
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:00,847
No! I wanted to fire you!

850
00:40:00,915 --> 00:40:03,082
I was talked down!

851
00:40:04,886 --> 00:40:07,686
Do you have any idea
what you are doing?

852
00:40:07,755 --> 00:40:10,440
Do you have any
idea what you've done?

853
00:40:10,509 --> 00:40:13,242
I made a mistake, Miranda.
People make mistakes.

854
00:40:13,311 --> 00:40:14,911
Surgeons make mistakes!

855
00:40:14,979 --> 00:40:16,729
I don't, not like that.

856
00:40:16,798 --> 00:40:20,366
You made an astonishing
error in judgment

857
00:40:20,434 --> 00:40:24,787
that I'm trying to
accept and forgive.

858
00:40:26,191 --> 00:40:29,892
And it's gonna take me a
lot longer than six months.

859
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:34,314
<i>All bleeding must stop.</i>

860
00:40:34,382 --> 00:40:37,617
Well, I am sorry
I disappoint you.

861
00:40:39,137 --> 00:40:41,437
<i>Sometimes it does so at a cost.</i>

862
00:40:41,506 --> 00:40:43,539
So am I.

863
00:40:43,608 --> 00:40:46,108
<i>You lose the arm,
remove the organ.</i>

864
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:52,243
<i>You choose to
live with the loss.</i>

865
00:40:52,267 --> 00:40:54,300
Chief?

866
00:40:57,989 --> 00:41:01,290
<i>Because at the end of the day,</i>

867
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:04,093
<i>you'll do whatever
you can to stay alive.</i>

868
00:41:07,048 --> 00:41:08,859
In the last hour,
he started moving,

869
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:11,383
responding to verbal stimuli.

870
00:41:11,452 --> 00:41:15,238
And now, vitals are
stable. He is re-oriented.

871
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:17,890
What... This is
one in a million.

872
00:41:17,959 --> 00:41:19,909
It should not have happened.

873
00:41:19,978 --> 00:41:23,328
<i>And sometimes, by
some miracle, it works.</i>

874
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:24,597
<i>The bleeding stops.</i>

875
00:41:24,666 --> 00:41:27,183
Well, does he know yet,
about his wife and baby?

876
00:41:28,286 --> 00:41:30,787
No. Not yet.

877
00:41:30,855 --> 00:41:31,935
He's asking.

878
00:41:37,579 --> 00:41:39,779
I was wrong, Bailey.

879
00:41:41,215 --> 00:41:42,455
You saved his life.

880
00:41:46,788 --> 00:41:49,455
And now I have to
go in there and ruin it.

881
00:41:49,523 --> 00:41:52,759
<i>But sometimes, no
matter how hard you try...</i>

882
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:07,706
<i>It's still not enough.</i>
