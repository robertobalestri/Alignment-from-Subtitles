1
00:00:03,204 --> 00:00:05,670
Huh, I didn't know Callie's
new girlfriend was a redhead.

2
00:00:05,739 --> 00:00:08,418
Oh, I think I need more
liquor. I'm not ready.

3
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:11,910
I'll get it.

4
00:00:17,935 --> 00:00:19,751
Hi. Meredith, this is Penny.

5
00:00:22,139 --> 00:00:24,439
Penny, this is Meredith.

6
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:26,341
Penny, it's a pleasure.
Won't you come in?

7
00:00:27,478 --> 00:00:28,510
Okay.

8
00:00:33,883 --> 00:00:35,750
You can put your
coats right in here.

9
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:39,199
Can I get either of
you something to drink?

10
00:00:39,223 --> 00:00:40,933
Beer, wine, margarita?

11
00:00:40,957 --> 00:00:45,243
Oh, a margarita sounds good, but
I'm on call, so club soda with lime.

12
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:46,528
I'm fine.

13
00:00:46,597 --> 00:00:47,830
What? No!

14
00:00:47,898 --> 00:00:49,998
I'm the one on call, not you.

15
00:00:50,067 --> 00:00:51,845
Come on, have some
fun tonight. I'm driving.

16
00:00:51,869 --> 00:00:53,451
White wine for you?

17
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,560
Yeah. White wine for her.

18
00:00:55,456 --> 00:00:57,055
Coming right up.

19
00:00:57,124 --> 00:00:59,202
I don't think this was a
good idea. We should leave.

20
00:00:59,226 --> 00:01:00,346
What? That's crazy.

21
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:01,804
It's just, it's too
much too soon.

22
00:01:01,828 --> 00:01:04,362
Relax. Everyone
is going to love you.

23
00:01:08,168 --> 00:01:09,546
We're gonna starve.
I don't know what to...

24
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:10,935
Where's Maggie?

25
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:13,950
I'm here!

26
00:01:13,974 --> 00:01:15,168
I'm here, I'm here, I'm
here, I'm here, I'm here.

27
00:01:15,192 --> 00:01:16,725
Where have you been?

28
00:01:16,794 --> 00:01:18,588
I'm just... I wasn't...
I'm here, okay?

29
00:01:18,612 --> 00:01:20,512
Except, God, I have to pee!

30
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,625
Listen, people are arriving, and
this all still looks like ingredients.

31
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:24,299
Do you have an ETA on dinner?

32
00:01:24,368 --> 00:01:26,412
You could roll up your sleeves
and start chopping something.

33
00:01:26,436 --> 00:01:28,403
Food prep has never
been my strong suit.

34
00:01:28,472 --> 00:01:30,434
I keep the guests happy. I'm
more your front-of-house gal.

35
00:01:30,458 --> 00:01:31,935
This dinner's
gonna be a disaster.

36
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:34,025
Everybody stop talking.

37
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:36,528
Meredith, you take over.

38
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:38,346
I got to pee!

39
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:40,992
Were you gonna do
something with those?

40
00:01:41,085 --> 00:01:42,851
Um... Yes.

41
00:01:42,937 --> 00:01:45,370
Uh, club soda
with lime for Torres

42
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,673
and white wine for her friend.

43
00:01:47,725 --> 00:01:49,824
She's here? Is she nice?

44
00:01:49,894 --> 00:01:51,288
Um, this bottle's empty.

45
00:01:51,312 --> 00:01:53,211
Are there more? Bottles?

46
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,574
The place looks nice, Mer.

47
00:01:54,598 --> 00:01:55,926
I like the hole
where the wall was.

48
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,149
Thank you so much.

49
00:01:57,217 --> 00:01:59,901
Can I get you two a drink?
Margarita, wine, beer?

50
00:01:59,987 --> 00:02:01,698
A margarita would be awesome.

51
00:02:01,722 --> 00:02:03,388
Okay. You got it.

52
00:02:04,341 --> 00:02:05,519
What's wrong?
You're being weird.

53
00:02:05,543 --> 00:02:07,403
A beer and a margarita
coming right up.

54
00:02:07,427 --> 00:02:08,547
She's being weird, right?

55
00:02:08,579 --> 00:02:10,044
She's being nice.

56
00:02:10,131 --> 00:02:11,463
To me.

57
00:02:11,532 --> 00:02:12,642
Which is weird.

58
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:13,798
See?

59
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:18,181
Wall here. Oh! Hi!

60
00:02:18,205 --> 00:02:19,282
This is Dr. April Kepner.

61
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:20,350
This is Penny. Hi.

62
00:02:22,843 --> 00:02:24,654
I'm just gonna go...
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

63
00:02:24,678 --> 00:02:25,822
Um, Kepner's on trauma.

64
00:02:25,846 --> 00:02:27,958
Uh, her husband is on plastics,

65
00:02:27,982 --> 00:02:29,759
although maybe not her husband.

66
00:02:29,783 --> 00:02:31,828
Yeah, we... We don't know.

67
00:02:31,852 --> 00:02:34,080
They might not know, but,
um, his mother owns the place.

68
00:02:34,104 --> 00:02:36,333
Oh, but it's not
nepotism. He's great.

69
00:02:36,357 --> 00:02:39,524
At last, we get to meet
the legendary Penny!

70
00:02:39,593 --> 00:02:41,003
Uh... That's me. That's mine.

71
00:02:41,027 --> 00:02:42,461
That's you. That's you.

72
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:44,640
Whatever she told you
about us, just ignore it.

73
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:45,664
Oh.

74
00:02:49,286 --> 00:02:51,219
Well, you're lovely.
She didn't lie.

75
00:02:51,288 --> 00:02:52,704
No!

76
00:02:52,772 --> 00:02:53,883
She speaks very, very
highly of you. You're welcome.

77
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:55,485
It's all true.

78
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:57,549
Kind of chaotic right now,
but don't worry about it.

79
00:03:00,964 --> 00:03:02,547
Food's in there.

80
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,765
Or will be.

81
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:05,116
Stand by.

82
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,886
Okay.

83
00:03:07,955 --> 00:03:10,951
Amelia's chief of neuro. She's
a little volatile, but outstanding.

84
00:03:10,975 --> 00:03:13,074
You want to sit down?

85
00:03:16,046 --> 00:03:17,890
Does Wilson like salt or...

86
00:03:17,914 --> 00:03:19,325
What's going on?
Are you all right?

87
00:03:19,349 --> 00:03:20,559
Yes. I'm great. How are you?

88
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:21,883
You're not great.

89
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:24,230
You're, uh... You're freaked
out and you're smiling a lot.

90
00:03:24,254 --> 00:03:25,965
Well, I'm having a dinner party.

91
00:03:25,989 --> 00:03:28,709
Yeah, like you're in a hostage video
or something. Something's wrong.

92
00:03:32,829 --> 00:03:34,707
Uh, the house, it's
filling with people,

93
00:03:34,731 --> 00:03:36,776
and I need to make drinks
for those people, and...

94
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,612
I'm possibly having a
dinner party with no dinner.

95
00:03:38,636 --> 00:03:40,035
I get that, but...

96
00:03:40,104 --> 00:03:41,964
Okay, I'll be right
back. I have to pee.

97
00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:43,548
Didn't you just pee?

98
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:45,690
Oh, hey, hey, hey!

99
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:47,036
Penny, this is Maggie Pierce.

100
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,476
Hey. Callie's told me some...

101
00:03:48,545 --> 00:03:50,505
Hi! Yes, welcome! Enjoy!

102
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:54,149
I'll be right... I just
have to use the...

103
00:03:54,218 --> 00:03:56,435
She's the child
prodigy one, right?

104
00:03:56,503 --> 00:03:58,632
Yes. It's disgusting.

105
00:03:58,656 --> 00:04:00,776
Head of cardio at like 12.

106
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,880
Ooh! Ooh, yes, please!

107
00:04:03,927 --> 00:04:04,927
Hi.

108
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:06,328
Hi. CALLIE: Yes.

109
00:04:06,397 --> 00:04:07,773
Ooh! Penny, you want one?

110
00:04:07,797 --> 00:04:09,117
Oh, uh, okay. Thank you.

111
00:04:11,534 --> 00:04:12,701
Great house.

112
00:04:12,769 --> 00:04:14,069
Thanks.

113
00:04:14,137 --> 00:04:15,417
Have you lived here long?

114
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:17,605
Sort of.

115
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:21,242
I grew up in this house, and I've
been here off and on ever since.

116
00:04:21,311 --> 00:04:23,962
I recently just moved back
in about a year and a half ago.

117
00:04:26,149 --> 00:04:27,149
Well, it's lovely.

118
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:29,801
Thanks.

119
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:35,641
Meredith is, uh,
head of general.

120
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:39,377
She was married to Derek
Shepherd, an amazing neurosurgeon.

121
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:40,756
About a year and
a half ago... Callie.

122
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,046
He was...

123
00:04:44,884 --> 00:04:46,124
Can we go?

124
00:04:46,886 --> 00:04:48,219
What is going on?

125
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:51,367
I'm sorry, but I really... I...

126
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:52,568
I just need...

127
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:54,309
Is it Arizona?

128
00:04:54,378 --> 00:04:56,706
Because I swear, it seems
like a big deal, but it's not.

129
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:57,762
I promise, she's great.

130
00:04:57,831 --> 00:05:00,581
No. No, it's not. I...

131
00:05:00,668 --> 00:05:02,411
Come on. Come on.
Let's rip the Band-Aid.

132
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:04,335
I will introduce you.

133
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:05,687
Come on.

134
00:05:05,756 --> 00:05:07,539
Good. Okay.

135
00:05:13,663 --> 00:05:15,608
Penny, this is Arizona Robbins.

136
00:05:15,632 --> 00:05:16,843
Arizona, this is Penny.

137
00:05:16,867 --> 00:05:18,344
Hi. ARIZONA: Hi.

138
00:05:18,368 --> 00:05:20,936
We've heard so many
great things about you.

139
00:05:21,004 --> 00:05:22,070
Oh.

140
00:05:22,138 --> 00:05:23,921
Oh, that's nice.

141
00:06:08,802 --> 00:06:11,431
We're not a trauma center
or a teaching hospital.

142
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:13,135
You did the best you could.

143
00:06:19,996 --> 00:06:21,956
<i>He saved all those people.</i>

144
00:06:22,616 --> 00:06:26,384
And it was my job to save him.

145
00:06:27,687 --> 00:06:29,487
And I failed.

146
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:31,589
And now he's gonna die...

147
00:06:34,762 --> 00:06:36,928
Because I was not a
good enough doctor...

148
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:39,564
<i>to keep him alive.</i>

149
00:06:58,585 --> 00:06:59,984
Occupied!

150
00:07:00,053 --> 00:07:01,514
Hurry up! There are
people in the other ones!

151
00:07:01,538 --> 00:07:02,570
I'm in here!

152
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,605
I... I'm gonna
pee on your floor!

153
00:07:09,212 --> 00:07:11,713
Oh! Ow!

154
00:07:11,799 --> 00:07:15,000
God, I think I'm being
punished for having sex.

155
00:07:15,068 --> 00:07:20,588
Amazing, regrettable, but
admittedly very hot sex with an intern.

156
00:07:20,657 --> 00:07:23,024
And if we've learned
anything from slasher movies,

157
00:07:23,093 --> 00:07:26,995
it's that people who have
sex get tortured and punished.

158
00:07:27,064 --> 00:07:28,758
And raging UTIs! Oh, God!

159
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:30,844
Why aren't you cooking?
You're supposed to be cooking!

160
00:07:30,868 --> 00:07:33,401
I am being tortured.
I have a UTI.

161
00:07:33,487 --> 00:07:36,749
Well, get some Pyridium
and get back in the game!

162
00:07:36,773 --> 00:07:38,017
I'm going to the hospital.

163
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:39,385
What? No, you can't.

164
00:07:39,409 --> 00:07:41,142
It's a UTI. Woman up!

165
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:43,744
A UTI, and what else?
I don't know this guy.

166
00:07:43,813 --> 00:07:45,775
I keep a very clean
house down there,

167
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:48,166
and right now, my
house is on fire.

168
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:49,479
God knows where he's been!

169
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:52,265
He looks like he
gets a lot of sex. A lot!

170
00:07:52,289 --> 00:07:53,588
With whom?

171
00:07:53,657 --> 00:07:55,073
Skanks, perhaps?

172
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:56,919
I mean, statistically,

173
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:58,788
there was probably a
skank or two in there.

174
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:01,074
He could've brought
anything into my house.

175
00:08:01,098 --> 00:08:03,893
God, I feel toxic. I need... I
need to go to the hospital.

176
00:08:03,917 --> 00:08:06,963
I need a battery of tests
and a silkwood shower.

177
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:09,949
No, I just... I
want to feel clean.

178
00:08:09,973 --> 00:08:11,239
Think like a chef.

179
00:08:11,308 --> 00:08:12,836
You have to cook!
We have guests!

180
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:15,426
No one wants me
touching their food.

181
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,406
We have a house full
of starving surgeons!

182
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:18,508
You can't just leave!

183
00:08:18,532 --> 00:08:20,275
Watch me. - Maggie!

184
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:22,144
Amelia, what if it's an STD?

185
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:32,087
Oh, gosh, I've moved all over.

186
00:08:32,111 --> 00:08:33,478
Um, three naval bases,

187
00:08:33,547 --> 00:08:35,191
in the States, Guam, Bahrain.

188
00:08:35,215 --> 00:08:36,559
Whoa. Hold on.
We lived in Bahrain.

189
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:37,610
Get out.

190
00:08:37,634 --> 00:08:38,912
It's the hospital.

191
00:08:38,936 --> 00:08:40,402
This is Dr. Torres.

192
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:43,037
My, uh, mom's a
petroleum seismologist.

193
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:46,290
Every two years, new school,
new language, new food.

194
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,480
I was in college before I
ever tried mac and cheese.

195
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:51,474
Mm, gosh. Well, try telling a
class your name is Arizona.

196
00:08:51,498 --> 00:08:54,043
"No, honey, not where you're
from. What's your name?"

197
00:08:54,067 --> 00:08:55,962
Okay. All right,
you had it worse.

198
00:08:58,471 --> 00:08:59,666
I'll get that. Would you...

199
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:00,805
Yeah, I'll finish.

200
00:09:03,844 --> 00:09:05,287
Hey. Hey. Am I late?

201
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:07,056
No, not at all. You can
set your coat over there.

202
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,224
Can I get you a drink?

203
00:09:08,248 --> 00:09:10,432
Uh, you know what?
Whiskey would be great.

204
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:13,735
Oh, that's hysterical.

205
00:09:17,858 --> 00:09:19,690
Or I can just grab it myself.

206
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,760
Thanks.

207
00:09:25,465 --> 00:09:26,814
Hey.

208
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,000
I didn't know if you
were gonna be here.

209
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:30,896
But then I don't even know
where you live now, so...

210
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:34,255
Do you want to do this now, or
can we, like, just be at a party?

211
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:35,407
Forget it.

212
00:09:35,475 --> 00:09:37,219
I'm staying at Ben and Bailey's.

213
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:39,789
And after tonight, I'll
probably just get a hotel room.

214
00:09:39,813 --> 00:09:41,662
Hi. Oh, can I steal
her for a minute?

215
00:09:41,731 --> 00:09:43,097
Thanks. Excuse me.

216
00:09:47,537 --> 00:09:49,054
I met her. Penny!

217
00:09:49,122 --> 00:09:50,733
Jackson's staying at
Bailey's. I don't hate her.

218
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:52,423
I like her. I like her a lot.

219
00:09:52,492 --> 00:09:55,288
So the chief of surgery is aiding and
abetting the dissolution of my marriage.

220
00:09:55,312 --> 00:09:56,356
That's... That's nice.

221
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:57,623
She's genuinely great.

222
00:09:57,647 --> 00:10:00,648
And Callie is so happy,
and I'm drinking, and...

223
00:10:00,717 --> 00:10:01,883
Mmm.

224
00:10:01,951 --> 00:10:02,951
You with me?

225
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,364
Oh, I am way ahead of you.

226
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:08,397
Mmm-hmm.

227
00:10:13,764 --> 00:10:16,676
So, it looks like dinner
is gonna be a while.

228
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,940
Hope you ate before you came.

229
00:10:21,438 --> 00:10:22,703
You're pissed.

230
00:10:22,772 --> 00:10:26,124
You have every right
to be, but I didn't know.

231
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:28,454
Could we just talk,
please, for a minute?

232
00:10:28,478 --> 00:10:30,278
It's important.

233
00:10:30,346 --> 00:10:32,506
You look like you'd rather
be anywhere else but here.

234
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:34,482
Yes.

235
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:36,401
Could we just go...

236
00:10:37,254 --> 00:10:39,137
Cheers.

237
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:41,333
What do you think the
minimum amount of time is

238
00:10:41,357 --> 00:10:43,269
that I have to be here
before it counts as, like,

239
00:10:43,293 --> 00:10:45,059
"Yeah, Jackson was here"?

240
00:10:45,128 --> 00:10:46,455
Twenty minutes, minimum. Okay.

241
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,691
If this weren't a dinner party.

242
00:10:48,715 --> 00:10:50,192
Your empty seat's
gonna give you away.

243
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:52,056
And there's that. There is that.

244
00:10:55,254 --> 00:10:57,199
I don't even know what
Maggie was gonna do with this.

245
00:10:57,223 --> 00:10:59,457
Should we order pizza?
Let's just order pizza.

246
00:10:59,526 --> 00:11:01,137
Did something
happen? Is it the kids?

247
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:02,805
Did Maggie leave? Is it Maggie?

248
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:05,207
No. Stop it. We are
not ordering pizza.

249
00:11:05,231 --> 00:11:06,475
There is plenty of food here.

250
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,616
No one knows how to cook it.

251
00:11:08,702 --> 00:11:10,012
Everybody loves pizza.

252
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:11,914
Who are you trying
to impress? Penny?

253
00:11:11,938 --> 00:11:13,733
'Cause Penny will roll
with it. She's a delight.

254
00:11:13,757 --> 00:11:15,151
She's smart. She's funny.

255
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:17,152
We have a crazy
amount in common.

256
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:19,276
Hi, Penny. I'm Jackson.

257
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:20,456
Very nice to meet you.

258
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,947
Oh, God. Maybe I
should date Penny.

259
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:24,916
No. Ill-advised.

260
00:11:24,968 --> 00:11:27,301
She's pretty. Callie...

261
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:28,936
Callie picked a pretty Penny.

262
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:30,416
How much have you had to drink?

263
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,017
So, what... Ten pizzas?

264
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:33,441
I'll cook!

265
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:35,004
I need something
to do anyway. Yes!

266
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:36,906
Wilson, you'll assist.

267
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:39,463
Uh, that's okay. I'm just
gonna grab some more...

268
00:11:39,533 --> 00:11:41,733
Here. Peel and cut
into quarter-inch rounds.

269
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:45,003
Great. I didn't
think I was at work.

270
00:11:45,072 --> 00:11:46,382
I could kiss you on the mouth!

271
00:11:46,406 --> 00:11:48,351
Well, someone should.

272
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:49,818
I'll help. Give me
something to do.

273
00:11:49,842 --> 00:11:52,226
All right. Uh, wash
and slice apples.

274
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:53,811
Jo, when you're done with that,

275
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,290
run to the store for a pound
and a half of Manchego cheese,

276
00:11:55,314 --> 00:11:57,034
and then check back
in with me for more.

277
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,416
Who are you calling?

278
00:11:58,484 --> 00:12:01,185
Running errands is
scut. Interns do scut.

279
00:12:01,254 --> 00:12:04,122
Cross, I need you at
Dr. Grey's house, stat.

280
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:05,284
You don't even know how to cook.

281
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:06,791
Alex, I'm a surgeon.

282
00:12:06,843 --> 00:12:08,737
I know how to use a knife.

283
00:12:08,761 --> 00:12:09,761
Ow!

284
00:12:11,113 --> 00:12:13,097
See? You distracted me.

285
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:15,383
Where is Pierce anyway?

286
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:21,538
In the last six months, have
you been sexually active?

287
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:24,775
In the last 48 hours.

288
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:26,510
Extremely active.

289
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:27,740
Overactive.

290
00:12:28,482 --> 00:12:29,914
So... Yes.

291
00:12:31,151 --> 00:12:33,017
The doctor will see you shortly.

292
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:36,937
Um, can you run a full STD
panel including HIV and Hep B?

293
00:12:40,376 --> 00:12:42,188
Oh, God.

294
00:12:44,831 --> 00:12:46,659
So, I understand you are...

295
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:47,915
Oh, God!

296
00:12:47,983 --> 00:12:49,795
What are you doing
here? Wow. Okay.

297
00:12:49,819 --> 00:12:51,597
I was on trauma, but
OB-GYN was swamped, so I...

298
00:12:51,621 --> 00:12:52,720
What are you doing here?

299
00:12:52,806 --> 00:12:54,817
I just go where
they tell me to go.

300
00:12:54,841 --> 00:12:56,357
You don't go here.

301
00:12:56,426 --> 00:12:58,070
Do you want me to
find you another doctor?

302
00:12:58,094 --> 00:12:59,460
Yes. Okay.

303
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:03,392
Oh, God.

304
00:13:07,436 --> 00:13:10,116
Ow! Shut up and stay still.

305
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:11,947
There.

306
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:20,448
Callie's girlfriend is...

307
00:13:20,517 --> 00:13:22,160
She seems nice enough.

308
00:13:22,184 --> 00:13:25,664
I haven't talked to her much,
but you can tell she's into Torres.

309
00:13:26,455 --> 00:13:27,488
What?

310
00:13:28,024 --> 00:13:29,024
She...

311
00:13:29,092 --> 00:13:30,158
Hey.

312
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:32,226
Well, I've got to go check on

313
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:34,523
a posterior shoulder
dislocation at the ER.

314
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:37,809
I tried to talk the fellow
through it, but he's an idiot, so...

315
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:39,078
Uh, thank you for having us.

316
00:13:39,102 --> 00:13:41,581
No, no, no. You
stay and have fun.

317
00:13:41,605 --> 00:13:42,882
This won't take long.

318
00:13:42,906 --> 00:13:44,884
No, I'd rather... I'll...
I'll keep you company.

319
00:13:44,908 --> 00:13:46,652
Penny should stay, right?

320
00:13:46,676 --> 00:13:48,142
Sure.

321
00:13:48,211 --> 00:13:49,222
I'll be back in no time.

322
00:13:49,246 --> 00:13:51,686
Alex, get her another drink.

323
00:13:54,367 --> 00:13:55,599
What are you drinking?

324
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:56,934
Uh, white wine.

325
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:58,580
Hopefully, Robbins
hasn't drank it all.

326
00:13:58,604 --> 00:14:00,338
Hey.

327
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:02,735
Do me a favor. I feel
really bad leaving.

328
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:06,159
Will you keep an eye on her
and make sure she has fun?

329
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:08,460
Thank you.

330
00:14:18,925 --> 00:14:19,925
Meredith?

331
00:14:19,993 --> 00:14:22,060
Don't do that. Please go mingle.

332
00:14:22,128 --> 00:14:24,208
Please, can we just talk?

333
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:27,009
Okay, here's how
this is gonna go.

334
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:28,978
You are going to make a drink,

335
00:14:29,002 --> 00:14:33,187
and you can make small talk with
anyone you want except for me.

336
00:14:33,255 --> 00:14:35,084
Callie will come back,
we will have a meal,

337
00:14:35,108 --> 00:14:36,357
you'll leave my house,

338
00:14:36,426 --> 00:14:38,204
and then I never have
to see you again, okay?

339
00:14:38,228 --> 00:14:40,795
Hey, Dr. Bailey.
Come and meet Penny.

340
00:14:40,864 --> 00:14:43,681
Penny, Dr. Bailey,
our chief of surgery.

341
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,416
Penny Blake. Nice to meet you.

342
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:47,017
Penny Blake? Have we met?

343
00:14:47,954 --> 00:14:48,981
No.

344
00:14:49,005 --> 00:14:51,356
Huh. The name sounds familiar.

345
00:14:51,424 --> 00:14:53,724
Well, where the
hell's Torres, then?

346
00:14:55,211 --> 00:14:56,422
I don't know what
she was worried about.

347
00:14:56,446 --> 00:14:57,623
I mean, Arizona loves her.

348
00:14:57,647 --> 00:14:59,308
They were like talk,
talk, talk, talk, talk.

349
00:14:59,332 --> 00:15:01,076
I mean, everyone loves her.

350
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,828
You have to meet her.
You're coming over, right?

351
00:15:02,852 --> 00:15:04,413
I am headed there right now.

352
00:15:04,437 --> 00:15:06,348
Oh, hey. Why don't
we drive over together?

353
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:08,589
This consult won't take
more than like 10, 15 minutes.

354
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:10,769
Sure. Yeah, that'll
give you time to change.

355
00:15:10,793 --> 00:15:11,870
Sounds good. Wait.

356
00:15:11,894 --> 00:15:13,789
Wait. I need to...
I need to change?

357
00:15:13,813 --> 00:15:15,079
Oh! No, you look fine.

358
00:15:15,148 --> 00:15:16,347
That looks good.

359
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:17,999
On you.

360
00:15:18,067 --> 00:15:19,801
You know Amelia is there, right?

361
00:15:19,869 --> 00:15:21,469
Uh...

362
00:15:21,538 --> 00:15:24,171
Okay, when the potatoes are
done, we will sprinkle the Manchego,

363
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,384
and then I'll dress this salad.

364
00:15:25,408 --> 00:15:26,619
You know, you're amazing.

365
00:15:26,643 --> 00:15:28,483
You just made order from chaos.

366
00:15:28,545 --> 00:15:29,911
You are a catch!

367
00:15:29,979 --> 00:15:31,979
You know, maybe
no more knife for you.

368
00:15:32,048 --> 00:15:34,126
Then I'll sear the flank steak,
a couple minutes on each side,

369
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:35,616
turn the temperature down,

370
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:36,862
five to 10 minutes more
while we steam the peas.

371
00:15:36,886 --> 00:15:38,280
Hey, that smells good.
Do you need help?

372
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:40,116
Uh, yeah, you can
mince the garlic. Mm.

373
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,580
Yeah, I don't know
what that means.

374
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:44,625
Having fun yet?

375
00:15:44,694 --> 00:15:46,806
Fun? No, I'm not having fun.

376
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:48,824
Stephanie's ignoring
me, and I'm...

377
00:15:48,848 --> 00:15:51,548
Meredith is barely speaking
to anyone. You notice that?

378
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:54,279
You don't see the irony, do you?

379
00:15:54,303 --> 00:15:57,204
Hey, Wilson, thinner
slices, and... And more even.

380
00:15:57,273 --> 00:15:59,385
You know what? Forget it.
You're demoted to trash duty.

381
00:15:59,409 --> 00:16:00,719
What? Yeah.

382
00:16:00,743 --> 00:16:02,577
You know, Jackson is an idiot.

383
00:16:02,645 --> 00:16:04,395
Like, you cook. You're pretty.

384
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:06,480
You're... You're a Penny.

385
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:08,427
Maybe just come down?

386
00:16:08,451 --> 00:16:09,562
Why don't I have a Penny?

387
00:16:09,586 --> 00:16:11,335
Callie has one.

388
00:16:11,404 --> 00:16:13,032
Jackson's had one, but
now he's throwing it away.

389
00:16:13,056 --> 00:16:14,856
Will you please stop?

390
00:16:16,426 --> 00:16:17,608
I'm sorry.

391
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:21,245
This party sucks.

392
00:16:25,635 --> 00:16:27,301
Say "cheese"!

393
00:16:28,304 --> 00:16:29,470
What?

394
00:16:29,539 --> 00:16:31,650
You asked for Manchego cheese.

395
00:16:31,674 --> 00:16:33,452
You didn't say how much you
needed, so I just got a bunch.

396
00:16:33,476 --> 00:16:36,356
It's pretty pricy, but
I... Kitchen's that way!

397
00:16:36,513 --> 00:16:38,763
"Say 'cheese.'" Idiot.

398
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:45,147
I'll get out of your
way. You're busy.

399
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:46,270
No! Wait!

400
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:47,416
Let me just talk
to you one second.

401
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,740
Hang on.

402
00:16:48,808 --> 00:16:50,553
Are you wondering
how I'm even here,

403
00:16:50,577 --> 00:16:52,905
since you went behind my
back and told Shepherd I'm a liar?

404
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:54,478
Steph, listen. I
know that you...

405
00:16:54,547 --> 00:16:56,258
I guess she just took
my word over yours.

406
00:16:56,282 --> 00:16:57,692
I mean, you said yourself,

407
00:16:57,716 --> 00:17:00,045
they barely know
you exist, right?

408
00:17:01,236 --> 00:17:03,882
They got you
hauling trash. Please.

409
00:17:03,906 --> 00:17:05,383
Are you sure about this?

410
00:17:05,407 --> 00:17:07,647
It's only a couple blocks
away. The best tacos in town.

411
00:17:07,677 --> 00:17:09,187
Nobody has to know.

412
00:17:09,211 --> 00:17:10,239
Wanna do, like,
eight? Four each?

413
00:17:10,263 --> 00:17:12,375
Mm. Fine, a dozen.

414
00:17:14,167 --> 00:17:16,350
Okay, scale of one to 10,

415
00:17:16,419 --> 00:17:18,569
how badly does this
party suck so far?

416
00:17:18,637 --> 00:17:21,355
Like one sucks most, or 10 sucks
most? 'Cause it's one of those.

417
00:17:21,423 --> 00:17:22,890
Come on!

418
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,220
Look, I only came here for
the free food. There's no food.

419
00:17:24,244 --> 00:17:25,987
Your guests are
making the dinner.

420
00:17:26,011 --> 00:17:27,723
It's like you didn't even
want to have a party.

421
00:17:27,747 --> 00:17:29,008
Did somebody force
you to have this party?

422
00:17:29,032 --> 00:17:30,764
Sorry, just grabbing my coat.

423
00:17:30,834 --> 00:17:31,899
No, you're leaving?

424
00:17:32,902 --> 00:17:34,713
I'm feeling a
little light-headed.

425
00:17:34,737 --> 00:17:35,981
And I have a thing
in the morning.

426
00:17:36,005 --> 00:17:37,922
See? It's a one or a 10.

427
00:17:37,991 --> 00:17:39,940
Listen. Callie
will be right back.

428
00:17:40,009 --> 00:17:43,294
I know that this is a really tight bunch
and it is easy to feel stuck outside,

429
00:17:43,346 --> 00:17:46,431
but once they get to know
you, you have friends for life.

430
00:17:46,499 --> 00:17:48,065
They're nice.

431
00:17:48,134 --> 00:17:49,316
We're nice.

432
00:17:49,385 --> 00:17:50,546
Yeah. We're very nice.

433
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,836
We're nice people. You'll see.

434
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:54,650
I appreciate that,

435
00:17:54,674 --> 00:17:57,834
but I should really just
go and call it a night.

436
00:17:58,044 --> 00:17:59,243
Dinner's ready.

437
00:18:01,915 --> 00:18:03,525
Too late. You're trapped.

438
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:04,615
Come on.

439
00:18:10,023 --> 00:18:11,672
Chief, please, sit at the head.

440
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:14,191
Where'd you think
I was gonna sit?

441
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:17,490
You are sitting with me. Everyone
here has heard all my jokes.

442
00:18:17,514 --> 00:18:19,146
Perfect!

443
00:18:19,215 --> 00:18:21,532
Kepner, this looks amazing.

444
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:24,601
Please, dig in
before it gets cold.

445
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,521
We're good now.
Thanks. You can go home.

446
00:18:32,545 --> 00:18:34,845
No, no, no. You should
stay. Pull up a chair.

447
00:18:34,898 --> 00:18:36,575
- There are no chairs.
- Hmm?

448
00:18:36,599 --> 00:18:38,565
Well, I can just...
I can scooch in.

449
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:45,468
Uh, where's Torres?
She's at the hospital.

450
00:18:45,492 --> 00:18:47,570
What, she just left
you here by yourself?

451
00:18:47,594 --> 00:18:48,754
I would kill you.

452
00:18:48,778 --> 00:18:50,272
She said she'll be right back.

453
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:51,840
Although, we all know
how night calls go.

454
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:53,847
I might be asking one
of you for a ride home.

455
00:18:53,917 --> 00:18:55,778
Yeah, well, she
better get back soon,

456
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:57,379
otherwise I'll take
you home myself.

457
00:18:57,403 --> 00:19:00,103
Find a penny, pick it up.

458
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:01,839
No... What, I'm...
I'm being nice.

459
00:19:01,907 --> 00:19:03,587
Dr. Robbins, you drunk.

460
00:19:05,228 --> 00:19:06,771
Don't think I've ever seen that.

461
00:19:06,795 --> 00:19:08,245
I like drunk Robbins.

462
00:19:10,716 --> 00:19:11,915
I do, too.

463
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:14,163
So, Penny, I've been
chained to the stove all night.

464
00:19:14,187 --> 00:19:15,786
What did you say you do?

465
00:19:15,855 --> 00:19:17,037
I'm a doctor.

466
00:19:17,106 --> 00:19:19,239
A surgery resident, actually.

467
00:19:19,308 --> 00:19:21,859
Of course. Penny's a doctor.
'Cause Penny's perfect.

468
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:23,343
Perfect, pretty Penny.

469
00:19:23,413 --> 00:19:24,962
Where do you work?

470
00:19:25,031 --> 00:19:28,260
At the moment, uh,
technically, I'm between gigs.

471
00:19:28,284 --> 00:19:30,334
What does that mean?

472
00:19:30,403 --> 00:19:32,954
Well, uh, last year...

473
00:19:33,022 --> 00:19:37,774
The hospital where I was
working was closed down.

474
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:41,144
And then, um, right
before I met Calliope...

475
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:42,312
Aww!

476
00:19:42,382 --> 00:19:43,714
Calliope.

477
00:19:43,783 --> 00:19:45,182
I used to call her that.

478
00:19:45,251 --> 00:19:46,462
Arizona. Huh?

479
00:19:46,486 --> 00:19:47,997
It's kind of like a joke with us

480
00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:51,005
'cause my name's Penelope.

481
00:19:51,073 --> 00:19:52,840
Penelope, Calliope.

482
00:19:52,909 --> 00:19:54,241
Penelope Blake!

483
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:55,955
Whoa! See who's drunk now?

484
00:19:55,979 --> 00:19:59,480
That's why I know your
name. You're in my calendar.

485
00:19:59,548 --> 00:20:01,732
I have a meeting
with you on Monday.

486
00:20:03,203 --> 00:20:05,369
Yes. ALEX: Why?

487
00:20:05,438 --> 00:20:08,372
Well, she is a new
resident transfer.

488
00:20:08,441 --> 00:20:09,490
What?

489
00:20:09,558 --> 00:20:10,798
Well, yeah.

490
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:13,243
She's joining the program
at Grey Sloan Memorial.

491
00:20:13,312 --> 00:20:15,112
Congratulations.

492
00:20:17,766 --> 00:20:18,966
That's perfect.

493
00:20:19,035 --> 00:20:21,475
Are you kidding? Is she kidding?

494
00:20:22,604 --> 00:20:23,637
I rematched.

495
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,841
To Grey Sloan Memorial.

496
00:20:26,909 --> 00:20:30,711
Where were you working
before? The place that closed?

497
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:32,424
It was a...

498
00:20:32,448 --> 00:20:35,633
A smaller suburban
center out by the sound.

499
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:40,238
She was at Dillard.

500
00:20:43,443 --> 00:20:44,742
Dillard Medical Center.

501
00:20:44,811 --> 00:20:47,995
Dillard... Dillard...
Isn't that, um...

502
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:49,930
That's where Derek died.

503
00:20:55,688 --> 00:20:57,104
Isn't that right, Penny?

504
00:20:59,142 --> 00:21:00,675
That's...

505
00:21:00,743 --> 00:21:02,359
That's right.

506
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:04,729
Perfect Penny killed my husband.

507
00:21:10,035 --> 00:21:12,380
Kepner, the food
is getting cold.

508
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:13,888
Let's pass those peas.

509
00:21:20,096 --> 00:21:21,261
Excuse me.

510
00:21:41,149 --> 00:21:42,166
What?

511
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:45,302
What did she say?

512
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:48,912
I think what she meant...

513
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:51,191
What...

514
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:53,580
What she was trying to say...

515
00:21:53,946 --> 00:21:55,329
I'm gonna go check on Mer.

516
00:21:58,801 --> 00:22:02,002
So, were you Derek's doctor?

517
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:04,352
I was one of them, yeah.

518
00:22:07,509 --> 00:22:08,875
Yes, I was.

519
00:22:08,945 --> 00:22:10,444
Wait, I'm sorry.

520
00:22:10,512 --> 00:22:12,079
You're coming to work with us?

521
00:22:12,165 --> 00:22:14,064
You were there that night?

522
00:22:14,133 --> 00:22:15,732
You treated him?

523
00:22:15,801 --> 00:22:17,179
The night her husband came in...

524
00:22:17,203 --> 00:22:18,203
My brother.

525
00:22:19,905 --> 00:22:21,205
Derek was my brother.

526
00:22:27,312 --> 00:22:28,407
Hey! Hi! Hey, guys. How are you?

527
00:22:28,431 --> 00:22:29,711
Ooh! Good, we
didn't miss dinner!

528
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:33,380
See? I told you I was
only gonna be a minute.

529
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:35,970
Ah. So...

530
00:22:36,422 --> 00:22:37,422
Um...

531
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:40,419
Whoa. What's going on?

532
00:22:40,443 --> 00:22:42,086
Um, Penny's coming
to work with us.

533
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:43,172
Oh! This is Penny.

534
00:22:43,196 --> 00:22:44,562
Wait for it.

535
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:45,645
You told them?

536
00:22:45,732 --> 00:22:47,126
I thought we were
gonna wait until...

537
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:48,215
Penny killed Derek.

538
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:53,015
Please, can we just, uh, talk?

539
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,683
What did you just say?

540
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:57,807
Penny used to work at, uh...

541
00:22:57,877 --> 00:22:59,588
She was there the
night that he died.

542
00:22:59,612 --> 00:23:01,328
She was his doctor.

543
00:23:01,397 --> 00:23:03,308
Meredith said she killed him.

544
00:23:03,332 --> 00:23:04,810
Oh, whoa, whoa, hang on.

545
00:23:04,834 --> 00:23:08,218
No, Penny was just gonna
tell me what happened, right?

546
00:23:09,655 --> 00:23:10,871
How my brother died.

547
00:23:25,037 --> 00:23:26,715
It's probably gonna
be another 45 minutes.

548
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:28,939
Oh, God.

549
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:31,441
I'm... I'm sure it's just a UTI.

550
00:23:33,362 --> 00:23:34,928
Here.

551
00:23:34,997 --> 00:23:37,764
Pyridium. Two tablets, three
times a day with cranberry juice.

552
00:23:37,834 --> 00:23:39,499
Effective and delicious.

553
00:23:39,568 --> 00:23:42,014
Um, I'm going to wait for
the test results to come back.

554
00:23:42,038 --> 00:23:44,499
I'd rather hear it from
science than from you.

555
00:23:44,523 --> 00:23:46,690
Look, if it's
burning, it's a UTI.

556
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:49,938
Or it's chlamydia or
gonorrhea or any of the "ias."

557
00:23:49,962 --> 00:23:52,412
Who do you think I am?
I don't know who you are.

558
00:23:52,481 --> 00:23:53,525
That's the point.

559
00:23:53,549 --> 00:23:54,881
I don't know you either, okay?

560
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:56,278
But you're the one who
shows up with a burning...

561
00:23:56,302 --> 00:23:58,618
Watch it.

562
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:00,598
You know, I could assume that
you might've given me something,

563
00:24:00,622 --> 00:24:01,702
but I don't do that, do I?

564
00:24:01,757 --> 00:24:04,558
No. I don't immediately
call you a slut.

565
00:24:07,045 --> 00:24:08,485
You're right.

566
00:24:09,648 --> 00:24:10,676
I'm sorry.

567
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,032
Thank you.

568
00:24:13,035 --> 00:24:14,755
Geez.

569
00:24:15,855 --> 00:24:18,215
I thought that was for me.

570
00:24:18,256 --> 00:24:19,256
Right.

571
00:24:19,325 --> 00:24:20,490
Sorry.

572
00:24:31,554 --> 00:24:33,197
Hey, wait. So, you
knew about this?

573
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:35,272
No, I knew her name. That's all.

574
00:24:35,341 --> 00:24:36,756
Webber handles the residents.

575
00:24:36,843 --> 00:24:38,559
It was a midterm match.

576
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:39,788
So she's gonna be
a resident with us?

577
00:24:39,812 --> 00:24:40,877
Come on.

578
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:41,990
Penny, what's she talking about?

579
00:24:42,014 --> 00:24:43,494
I tried to tell you.

580
00:24:44,884 --> 00:24:46,211
When? When did you ever...

581
00:24:46,235 --> 00:24:47,300
When we got here.

582
00:24:47,369 --> 00:24:49,489
Yeah, so, tell us now.

583
00:24:50,272 --> 00:24:52,072
Tell me what happened.

584
00:24:53,676 --> 00:24:55,643
Wait.

585
00:24:55,711 --> 00:24:57,005
Penny, you don't...
You don't have to.

586
00:24:57,029 --> 00:24:58,278
Can you and I talk?

587
00:24:58,364 --> 00:24:59,991
That is a good idea, actually.
- No. No. No.

588
00:25:00,015 --> 00:25:01,143
Why don't we give
them some space...

589
00:25:01,167 --> 00:25:02,599
She was there!

590
00:25:02,668 --> 00:25:03,795
Can we just... I want
to hear what happened.

591
00:25:03,819 --> 00:25:05,259
Did you make a mistake?

592
00:25:06,022 --> 00:25:07,182
Did you... Amelia.

593
00:25:07,206 --> 00:25:09,046
Tell me what happened!

594
00:25:16,082 --> 00:25:19,042
I was the resident on
call that night, in trauma.

595
00:25:20,753 --> 00:25:21,993
We were understaffed.

596
00:25:22,989 --> 00:25:24,355
Five came in with him.

597
00:25:25,358 --> 00:25:26,891
And her...

598
00:25:28,895 --> 00:25:31,011
Your brother had flail chest.

599
00:25:31,079 --> 00:25:32,457
My brother died
of a brain bleed.

600
00:25:32,481 --> 00:25:34,331
No.

601
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,045
There was a scalp
laceration, but no step-off.

602
00:25:37,069 --> 00:25:39,553
He was bleeding into his chest.

603
00:25:39,622 --> 00:25:42,356
A choice was made to skip CT.

604
00:25:43,409 --> 00:25:45,692
I thought he needed one.

605
00:25:45,761 --> 00:25:47,356
I should've pushed harder.

606
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:48,607
Hell yeah, you should have.

607
00:25:48,631 --> 00:25:50,296
And...

608
00:25:50,365 --> 00:25:52,750
And then I was stuck waiting

609
00:25:52,818 --> 00:25:55,018
on a neuro attending
who couldn't be bothered...

610
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:07,012
I just sound like I am
making excuses for myself.

611
00:26:13,271 --> 00:26:14,354
I'm very sorry.

612
00:26:18,294 --> 00:26:19,526
I should just go.

613
00:26:19,595 --> 00:26:20,923
Tell me the rest.

614
00:26:20,947 --> 00:26:21,947
Tell me all of it.

615
00:26:21,998 --> 00:26:23,163
Amelia, come on.

616
00:26:23,249 --> 00:26:25,582
I didn't get to see him.

617
00:26:25,651 --> 00:26:27,645
You saw him before
he went into surgery.

618
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:29,203
You were the last
one to see him.

619
00:26:29,288 --> 00:26:30,288
You did.

620
00:26:30,339 --> 00:26:31,733
Amelia, that's enough.

621
00:26:31,757 --> 00:26:33,268
Did he say anything to you...

622
00:26:33,292 --> 00:26:34,541
Before you killed him?

623
00:26:36,462 --> 00:26:38,123
Can you tell me what
his last words were?

624
00:26:39,382 --> 00:26:40,880
That's enough.

625
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,960
Get her out of my house.

626
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:04,699
So, what do you want to do?

627
00:27:04,723 --> 00:27:05,489
Do you want me to get her
out of here? Get everybody out?

628
00:27:05,557 --> 00:27:06,557
I don't know!

629
00:27:08,193 --> 00:27:10,093
I'm not gonna let them do this.

630
00:27:10,162 --> 00:27:11,339
It's not gonna happen.

631
00:27:11,363 --> 00:27:13,040
We will call a
meeting of the board,

632
00:27:13,064 --> 00:27:15,076
and we'll have a vote,
and we will fire that bitch!

633
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,820
We'll... We're stopping this.

634
00:27:19,438 --> 00:27:21,518
We're gonna take
care of this, right?

635
00:27:22,141 --> 00:27:24,074
Meredith?

636
00:27:24,143 --> 00:27:26,104
Why aren't you saying anything?

637
00:27:26,128 --> 00:27:28,768
Because I really... I really
don't want to talk about this.

638
00:27:28,898 --> 00:27:29,930
Yeah.

639
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:33,600
Clearly.

640
00:27:33,669 --> 00:27:36,248
You knew who she was all night,
and you never bothered telling me.

641
00:27:36,272 --> 00:27:37,272
Amelia.

642
00:27:37,339 --> 00:27:38,750
She killed Derek!

643
00:27:38,774 --> 00:27:40,318
You invite her in here.

644
00:27:40,342 --> 00:27:42,153
You let me sit there
and talk to her all...

645
00:27:42,177 --> 00:27:44,861
I... Well, I hugged her.

646
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:47,347
Why? Why would
you do that to me?

647
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:48,448
I did this to you?

648
00:27:48,517 --> 00:27:51,401
You should've told
me. You should have.

649
00:27:51,454 --> 00:27:52,531
I thought that you and I...

650
00:27:52,555 --> 00:27:56,256
I did nothing to you.

651
00:27:56,342 --> 00:27:59,359
I lost my husband and
the father of my children,

652
00:27:59,428 --> 00:28:01,161
and you're falling apart?

653
00:28:01,229 --> 00:28:03,497
I don't get to do that
because I have three kids.

654
00:28:03,565 --> 00:28:06,416
So please, shut up
and get out of my room!

655
00:28:06,485 --> 00:28:07,685
Meredith.

656
00:28:07,719 --> 00:28:10,086
Get her out of
here before I kill her!

657
00:28:23,969 --> 00:28:26,489
Can you hold on one second?

658
00:28:27,439 --> 00:28:29,799
What's the address here?

659
00:28:32,277 --> 00:28:33,593
For the cab.

660
00:28:37,166 --> 00:28:38,510
I still don't understand.

661
00:28:38,534 --> 00:28:40,562
You were coming to work
here. Why didn't you tell me?

662
00:28:40,586 --> 00:28:41,618
Just...

663
00:28:43,755 --> 00:28:44,835
I'll call back.

664
00:28:47,375 --> 00:28:48,455
Uh...

665
00:28:51,363 --> 00:28:52,763
It's a huge hospital.

666
00:28:53,999 --> 00:28:56,280
Callie, I didn't know
if you knew him.

667
00:28:56,769 --> 00:28:57,996
I didn't... Knew him?

668
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:59,052
He was my friend.

669
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:01,955
Meredith, all of us.

670
00:29:05,093 --> 00:29:07,374
He was the worst
night of my life.

671
00:29:26,748 --> 00:29:28,527
Do you want me to call Webber?

672
00:29:28,551 --> 00:29:29,961
Maybe find a meeting?

673
00:29:29,985 --> 00:29:31,185
They can't do this.

674
00:29:32,054 --> 00:29:33,654
They can't do this to me.

675
00:29:35,057 --> 00:29:37,297
Nobody did anything to you.

676
00:29:38,661 --> 00:29:39,993
Amelia, this was...

677
00:29:43,299 --> 00:29:45,243
A terrible night for a lot
of people, not just you.

678
00:29:45,267 --> 00:29:48,267
I mean, look at Meredith,
Callie. Look at... Look at Penny.

679
00:29:48,437 --> 00:29:50,803
Whose side are you on?

680
00:29:50,873 --> 00:29:53,172
What? Just...

681
00:29:53,241 --> 00:29:55,041
God! How do you do that?

682
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:58,695
How are you always
so calm, and reasonable,

683
00:29:58,764 --> 00:30:02,098
and logical and perfect?

684
00:30:02,167 --> 00:30:04,050
You're perfect.

685
00:30:04,119 --> 00:30:08,021
I am vomiting my life all
over the place all the time,

686
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:10,490
and nothing is
ever wrong with you.

687
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:12,025
You're...

688
00:30:13,328 --> 00:30:16,346
Why are you always so perfect?

689
00:30:16,414 --> 00:30:19,215
I'm not. Okay?

690
00:30:19,284 --> 00:30:21,404
I'm not perfect, not even close.

691
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:26,313
Okay, um...

692
00:30:28,176 --> 00:30:29,416
When the plane crashed...

693
00:30:30,979 --> 00:30:32,957
When I heard that
Cristina's plane had crashed,

694
00:30:32,981 --> 00:30:35,341
my first thought
was she was dead.

695
00:30:35,935 --> 00:30:38,368
And for a moment...

696
00:30:38,436 --> 00:30:39,636
I felt relieved.

697
00:30:41,774 --> 00:30:45,334
I felt terrible for feeling
it, but it was there.

698
00:30:47,029 --> 00:30:48,639
And I always knew on
some level she'd leave me,

699
00:30:48,663 --> 00:30:51,331
and I wasn't ready
to be hurt like that.

700
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,933
So if she was dead,

701
00:30:53,001 --> 00:30:56,169
we would stay
frozen in time forever.

702
00:30:56,238 --> 00:30:58,416
And she'd be gone, but
it wouldn't be so hard.

703
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:01,641
It wouldn't be a choice, to walk
away, to choose something else,

704
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:04,777
to move to Switzerland
and start another life.

705
00:31:04,846 --> 00:31:08,098
I was relieved that it was over
with a minimum of damage.

706
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:09,716
I hate myself for that.

707
00:31:12,187 --> 00:31:15,088
So I am not perfect, Amelia.

708
00:31:15,157 --> 00:31:17,352
I can be selfish,
and I can be scared,

709
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:19,709
and I make things
harder than I need to.

710
00:31:19,778 --> 00:31:23,058
I know I do. I make
things hard for us.

711
00:31:28,103 --> 00:31:29,103
Wow.

712
00:31:30,739 --> 00:31:32,956
That is the worst
thing I have ever heard.

713
00:31:34,242 --> 00:31:36,743
No, really, don't ever do drugs

714
00:31:36,812 --> 00:31:38,561
because you will
never be able to stop.

715
00:31:58,350 --> 00:31:59,616
We're not perfect.

716
00:32:03,355 --> 00:32:05,355
So what?

717
00:32:12,965 --> 00:32:15,932
Has anybody seen her? Penny?

718
00:32:16,001 --> 00:32:17,078
I think she was
waiting on a cab.

719
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:18,702
Am I supposed to do anything?

720
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,036
Because Callie's my ex,

721
00:32:20,105 --> 00:32:22,438
but on the other hand, you
know, she's my ex, so I...

722
00:32:22,507 --> 00:32:23,952
I'm guessing that means no?

723
00:32:23,976 --> 00:32:25,475
I feel bad for her.

724
00:32:25,543 --> 00:32:27,427
She was ambushed
tonight. It wasn't right.

725
00:32:27,495 --> 00:32:30,230
She's a resident,
you know, just like us.

726
00:32:30,316 --> 00:32:32,396
Yeah, well, that
could've been any of us.

727
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:33,951
It was me.

728
00:32:36,471 --> 00:32:39,456
My second year, I
made a stupid mistake.

729
00:32:39,524 --> 00:32:41,824
I missed an airway, and
I killed a child's mother.

730
00:32:41,893 --> 00:32:44,076
Okay, you didn't kill
anybody. It was mistake.

731
00:32:44,163 --> 00:32:46,262
I still pray for her.

732
00:32:46,332 --> 00:32:47,775
Every night, I
pray for her family.

733
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:50,200
Well, that stuff is
never one person's fault.

734
00:32:50,252 --> 00:32:52,351
Some things are just your fault.

735
00:32:52,421 --> 00:32:55,321
Some things you screw
up, and you can't take back

736
00:32:55,391 --> 00:32:56,790
no matter how hard you try.

737
00:32:56,859 --> 00:32:59,325
Some things you pay
for the rest of your life.

738
00:33:03,849 --> 00:33:06,799
That's the last of it. I
got to get her home.

739
00:33:06,868 --> 00:33:08,151
You're not driving, either.

740
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:09,786
No, I know. Um...

741
00:33:09,855 --> 00:33:12,572
Wilson got Cross
to take us home.

742
00:33:12,658 --> 00:33:15,018
Your dinner was
excellent tonight.

743
00:33:16,762 --> 00:33:17,802
Thanks.

744
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:23,311
Okay, you ready?

745
00:33:23,335 --> 00:33:24,367
Mmm-hmm, yeah.

746
00:33:24,436 --> 00:33:26,147
Okay. Come on. Totally. Oh!

747
00:33:27,522 --> 00:33:29,033
- Whoo!
- Whoo! You got it.

748
00:33:29,057 --> 00:33:30,537
Yeah. Okay. APRIL: Come on.

749
00:33:36,465 --> 00:33:39,160
I shouldn't have ratted
you out to Shepherd.

750
00:33:39,184 --> 00:33:41,884
I overheard Webber
and her talking.

751
00:33:41,937 --> 00:33:43,748
I know that you weren't lying.

752
00:33:43,772 --> 00:33:47,057
I am really sorry.

753
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,844
It's okay.

754
00:33:50,913 --> 00:33:54,364
I get it. I'm sorry
it happened, too.

755
00:33:55,834 --> 00:33:56,874
So...

756
00:33:57,969 --> 00:33:59,180
Alex is ignoring me.

757
00:33:59,204 --> 00:34:00,553
I know. Jerk.

758
00:34:00,622 --> 00:34:01,954
Jerk!

759
00:34:02,023 --> 00:34:03,783
Oh, God.

760
00:34:24,413 --> 00:34:25,413
You can go.

761
00:34:27,048 --> 00:34:28,568
What are you
gonna do if I leave?

762
00:34:41,213 --> 00:34:42,213
Ahh.

763
00:34:54,225 --> 00:34:55,759
Now she's a person.

764
00:35:06,588 --> 00:35:07,588
Hey.

765
00:35:12,244 --> 00:35:13,244
You okay?

766
00:35:13,312 --> 00:35:14,910
Yeah. Great.

767
00:35:21,203 --> 00:35:22,203
Sorry.

768
00:35:35,733 --> 00:35:37,667
I mean...

769
00:35:37,735 --> 00:35:40,403
My good relationships
started out as friends,

770
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:42,438
and then became more.

771
00:35:43,842 --> 00:35:46,475
And then, you know, died.

772
00:35:46,544 --> 00:35:48,584
Screaming.

773
00:35:49,347 --> 00:35:50,587
God, dating sucks.

774
00:35:50,615 --> 00:35:52,448
Sucks!

775
00:35:52,517 --> 00:35:54,462
See, my problem is
getting the second date

776
00:35:54,486 --> 00:35:56,714
because the first one
usually gets to sex,

777
00:35:56,738 --> 00:36:00,223
but the cool women, the
women I'd like to see again,

778
00:36:00,275 --> 00:36:03,109
there's always some sort
of automatic assumption

779
00:36:03,178 --> 00:36:04,288
that I've moved on.

780
00:36:04,312 --> 00:36:06,613
Yeah, I see that.
Why? Why is that?

781
00:36:06,698 --> 00:36:08,298
Well, um...

782
00:36:08,367 --> 00:36:10,534
For starters, uh...

783
00:36:11,603 --> 00:36:13,119
Your hair.

784
00:36:13,205 --> 00:36:15,605
It's very confident.

785
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:18,925
And swoopy. Mm.

786
00:36:18,994 --> 00:36:21,928
Yeah, it reaches out to people.

787
00:36:21,997 --> 00:36:26,532
And last night was clearly
not your first time at bat 'cause

788
00:36:26,602 --> 00:36:28,401
you knocked it out of the park.

789
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:31,972
Well, you pitched a perfect...

790
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,073
Game?

791
00:36:33,141 --> 00:36:34,674
I don't know baseball.

792
00:36:41,266 --> 00:36:45,301
How long does it take to,
um, get test results back?

793
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:48,521
Just go. I'll send
you the results.

794
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:50,301
And if it makes
you feel any better,

795
00:36:50,325 --> 00:36:53,170
if you want to know anything
about my history, just ask.

796
00:36:53,194 --> 00:36:54,661
I'll tell you anything.

797
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,208
I'm not sure I want to know.

798
00:36:57,232 --> 00:37:00,833
Well, the only alternative
is a little bit more difficult.

799
00:37:00,919 --> 00:37:02,101
What?

800
00:37:02,904 --> 00:37:04,144
You just trust me.

801
00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:10,242
Go. I have to change.

802
00:37:11,513 --> 00:37:12,553
Right.

803
00:37:17,585 --> 00:37:20,954
Uh, you know that there's nothing
I haven't already seen, right?

804
00:37:21,023 --> 00:37:22,588
Go! Oh, okay, okay.

805
00:37:26,745 --> 00:37:29,011
Just ditch Karev.

806
00:37:29,081 --> 00:37:31,214
I'll give you a ride.

807
00:37:31,283 --> 00:37:33,649
Honestly, I don't even
think that he would notice.

808
00:37:33,718 --> 00:37:35,430
No. No.

809
00:37:35,454 --> 00:37:37,053
Oh, God.

810
00:37:37,989 --> 00:37:38,989
Mm.

811
00:37:40,358 --> 00:37:41,402
I'm glad we talked.

812
00:37:41,426 --> 00:37:44,310
Today was... Just...

813
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,380
Today sucked.

814
00:37:47,448 --> 00:37:49,315
And... I don't know.

815
00:37:49,384 --> 00:37:51,579
I'm glad we didn't let that get
in the way of our friendship.

816
00:37:51,603 --> 00:37:53,369
I know. I know.

817
00:37:56,007 --> 00:37:59,392
It makes sense now. The
way that you do things.

818
00:37:59,478 --> 00:38:03,780
And you were sick, and
I had a crappy childhood,

819
00:38:03,848 --> 00:38:07,066
but it made us even
stronger, you know?

820
00:38:07,134 --> 00:38:11,387
We both had to work even
harder to get to where we are.

821
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:14,407
I just... I feel like I
understand you more.

822
00:38:14,475 --> 00:38:17,594
You understand me
more because I was sick?

823
00:38:17,663 --> 00:38:20,646
I just don't understand
why you didn't tell me.

824
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:23,416
You can't even wrap your
mind around it, can you?

825
00:38:23,484 --> 00:38:25,963
That I just might be
better at this than you are.

826
00:38:25,987 --> 00:38:30,656
That I might be stronger,
or smarter, or more savvy.

827
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:34,076
You need a reason for me
to have an edge up on you.

828
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:37,314
You need some deep,
dark secret motivating me,

829
00:38:37,382 --> 00:38:39,498
operating circles around you.

830
00:38:41,669 --> 00:38:44,332
You need an even playing field
before you can even be good with me.

831
00:38:44,356 --> 00:38:47,289
Okay. Wow.

832
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:50,776
Stop trying to make us even,
Jo, 'cause we're not even.

833
00:38:50,845 --> 00:38:53,446
Deal with your jealousy.
Deal with your shortcomings.

834
00:38:53,532 --> 00:38:55,652
Those are on you. Don't
put your crap on me.

835
00:38:58,102 --> 00:38:59,736
Hey! Oh!

836
00:38:59,804 --> 00:39:01,237
Everybody's gone?

837
00:39:01,305 --> 00:39:02,839
How was dinner?

838
00:39:02,907 --> 00:39:05,387
Don't tell me. I have to pee.

839
00:39:12,199 --> 00:39:15,000
Hey, have you seen
Penny? No. Sorry.

840
00:39:22,911 --> 00:39:24,110
Hey.

841
00:39:24,179 --> 00:39:25,611
Was Penny inside?

842
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,658
I mean, I see her stuff out
here, but I don't see her.

843
00:39:27,682 --> 00:39:29,093
No, I don't... I don't think so.

844
00:39:29,117 --> 00:39:31,362
I guess I thought she left.

845
00:39:31,386 --> 00:39:33,069
I probably would've.

846
00:39:33,121 --> 00:39:34,821
What are the odds?

847
00:39:34,889 --> 00:39:36,689
That she's the one person I...

848
00:39:38,627 --> 00:39:40,793
I don't know how to do it.

849
00:39:40,862 --> 00:39:42,261
I don't know how to shut it off.

850
00:39:42,330 --> 00:39:44,046
Shut what off?

851
00:39:45,316 --> 00:39:47,016
How I feel...

852
00:39:47,085 --> 00:39:49,165
Yeah. About her. I don't...

853
00:39:49,688 --> 00:39:51,153
I don't even know if I want to.

854
00:39:51,223 --> 00:39:53,356
Well, even if you want to,

855
00:39:53,425 --> 00:39:55,665
I'm not so sure that you can.

856
00:39:59,113 --> 00:40:00,742
All right, get home safe. Okay?

857
00:40:00,766 --> 00:40:01,998
You too.

858
00:40:07,872 --> 00:40:08,949
You're sure you're okay?

859
00:40:08,973 --> 00:40:11,118
If you want me to
stay or anything...

860
00:40:11,142 --> 00:40:13,087
I thought you said Jo was
waiting for you in the car.

861
00:40:13,111 --> 00:40:15,271
Look, Mer, I'm being serious.

862
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,280
Alex...

863
00:40:17,348 --> 00:40:18,581
I am fine.

864
00:40:18,649 --> 00:40:21,634
I will be fine, so
just go. It's okay.

865
00:40:21,702 --> 00:40:23,662
Okay.

866
00:40:24,406 --> 00:40:25,606
Night.

867
00:40:49,397 --> 00:40:50,429
Oh, gosh. Uh...

868
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:53,065
Okay, um...

869
00:40:55,036 --> 00:40:56,836
I didn't know that
you were down here.

870
00:40:58,189 --> 00:40:59,429
I'm leaving.

871
00:41:00,392 --> 00:41:01,591
I called a cab.

872
00:41:06,114 --> 00:41:08,092
I am so sorry about tonight.

873
00:41:08,116 --> 00:41:11,351
I never would've
come if I'd known.

874
00:41:11,419 --> 00:41:15,421
Tomorrow morning, I
am gonna file a request

875
00:41:15,490 --> 00:41:18,724
to be rematched with
another program, and...

876
00:41:19,961 --> 00:41:22,161
You will never have
to see me again.

877
00:41:30,338 --> 00:41:32,698
I want you to know that
I didn't forget about him.

878
00:41:34,792 --> 00:41:37,426
I never will.

879
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:40,763
What you said that night about
your husband being my one...

880
00:41:40,832 --> 00:41:43,700
I think about that
night, about him...

881
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:45,909
Every day.

882
00:41:51,543 --> 00:41:52,575
That's all.

883
00:42:00,735 --> 00:42:02,001
I'll see you Monday.

884
00:42:04,189 --> 00:42:05,189
Don't be late!
