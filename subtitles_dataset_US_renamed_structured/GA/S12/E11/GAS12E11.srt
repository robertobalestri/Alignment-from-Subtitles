1
00:00:12,412 --> 00:00:13,895
You're late. I know.

2
00:00:13,964 --> 00:00:16,204
She's worried.
Well, I'm here now.

3
00:00:19,637 --> 00:00:20,735
<i>In trauma,</i>

4
00:00:20,804 --> 00:00:23,255
<i>we're concerned with
one overriding question...</i>

5
00:00:24,875 --> 00:00:26,357
<i>How did this happen?</i>

6
00:00:26,426 --> 00:00:27,603
I didn't want you to see me yet.

7
00:00:27,627 --> 00:00:28,927
I know.

8
00:00:28,995 --> 00:00:31,613
Tatiana, you look...

9
00:00:32,482 --> 00:00:34,065
So beautiful.

10
00:00:34,134 --> 00:00:36,317
<i>What was the
mechanism of injury?</i>

11
00:00:36,386 --> 00:00:39,488
<i>How do we see past the mess
and confusion of the trauma</i>

12
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:42,874
<i>to figure out what the
damage actually is?</i>

13
00:00:42,943 --> 00:00:47,446
Infinite possibilities put the
patient on the table in front of you.

14
00:00:47,514 --> 00:00:50,949
Now you have to
figure out will they live?

15
00:00:52,652 --> 00:00:55,087
Will you be able to save them?

16
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,189
Or are they a lost cause?

17
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:00,559
No shared assets, no children,

18
00:01:00,628 --> 00:01:02,239
and, of course, there's a solid

19
00:01:02,263 --> 00:01:04,179
post-nuptial agreement in place.

20
00:01:04,247 --> 00:01:07,407
With nothing to contest, it's
just about signing the papers.

21
00:01:10,087 --> 00:01:12,465
The places to initial and
sign are all clearly marked.

22
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:15,189
Red tabs for initials,
blue tabs for signatures.

23
00:01:15,258 --> 00:01:18,643
<i>Every part of a trauma tells
a different piece of the story.</i>

24
00:01:18,696 --> 00:01:21,508
This is one of the simpler
divorces I've seen, actually.

25
00:01:21,532 --> 00:01:24,682
<i>And until you look at
each and every injury...</i>

26
00:01:27,871 --> 00:01:29,832
<i>So, what are you gonna do?
You gonna sign the papers?</i>

27
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:31,601
<i>We have to push,
and we have to fight.</i>

28
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:33,926
<i>I'm not sure we are
worth fighting for.</i>

29
00:01:35,495 --> 00:01:37,273
<i>You can't see what went wrong.</i>

30
00:01:37,297 --> 00:01:40,009
At work? That's where
you decide to do this?

31
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:41,867
You want to lower your voice?

32
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:43,446
What does it matter
how loud my voice is

33
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,137
when 35 people just
saw me get served

34
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:46,504
with divorce papers

35
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:48,573
in the middle of the
emergency room?

36
00:01:48,642 --> 00:01:50,175
I am sorry about
that, all right?

37
00:01:50,244 --> 00:01:52,177
That was not supposed to happen.

38
00:01:52,246 --> 00:01:53,422
He was supposed to talk to you
after you were done with work.

39
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:54,712
It's only been four weeks.

40
00:01:54,782 --> 00:01:56,114
Four, Jackson.

41
00:01:56,183 --> 00:01:57,293
Is that... That's
all the counseling

42
00:01:57,317 --> 00:01:58,950
you could handle before bailing?

43
00:01:59,019 --> 00:02:00,418
You said you wanted to try!

44
00:02:00,487 --> 00:02:01,787
We did try.

45
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:03,399
It didn't work. It didn't
get us anywhere.

46
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:04,801
We have the same exact fight

47
00:02:04,825 --> 00:02:06,770
over and over again,
around in circles.

48
00:02:06,794 --> 00:02:08,427
I'm telling you,
it's not working.

49
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:10,724
Then why are we even
bothering with counseling?

50
00:02:10,748 --> 00:02:12,814
What is the point of counseling

51
00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:15,395
if you're just gonna suddenly,
without even talking about it, just...

52
00:02:15,419 --> 00:02:17,419
Oh, come on. All
we do is talk, April.

53
00:02:17,487 --> 00:02:19,499
So, what? You just, you
just serve me papers?

54
00:02:19,523 --> 00:02:21,322
Just like that?

55
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:24,751
Do you have any idea what
a slap in the face this is?

56
00:02:29,817 --> 00:02:31,366
How long?

57
00:02:31,435 --> 00:02:34,002
How long have I been sitting on
a couch discussing my marriage

58
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:35,415
with someone who has
already checked out?

59
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:36,583
That's not what I was doing.

60
00:02:36,607 --> 00:02:37,867
No, I just want to
know when it happened.

61
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:39,758
When did you decide
that you were done?

62
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,640
She didn't say
that. Yeah, she did.

63
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:45,041
When did she say that?

64
00:02:45,065 --> 00:02:46,543
She's been saying it
for three weeks now.

65
00:02:46,567 --> 00:02:48,528
We shouldn't be having sex.

66
00:02:48,552 --> 00:02:50,736
I hardly think our
sex life is our problem.

67
00:02:50,804 --> 00:02:53,049
I don't think it's a problem.
It just... It gets in the way.

68
00:02:53,073 --> 00:02:54,189
In the way of what?

69
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:56,191
You're just hearing
what you want to hear.

70
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:58,805
I'm hearing what our therapist
is telling us, and you're not.

71
00:02:58,829 --> 00:03:01,558
It's like we're sitting in on two
completely different sessions.

72
00:03:01,582 --> 00:03:03,042
That's just offensive.

73
00:03:03,066 --> 00:03:04,711
What's offensive is you
keep choosing to ignore...

74
00:03:04,735 --> 00:03:06,468
I'm not ignoring anything!

75
00:03:06,554 --> 00:03:07,998
See? You can't ever
take responsibility.

76
00:03:08,022 --> 00:03:09,082
You never apologize
for anything.

77
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:11,022
I apologize

78
00:03:11,091 --> 00:03:12,323
all the time.

79
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:13,520
Not for the things that matter.

80
00:03:13,544 --> 00:03:14,838
What do I have to
apologize for, Jackson?

81
00:03:14,862 --> 00:03:16,628
I am here, and I'm trying.

82
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:18,346
I want to make this work.

83
00:03:18,415 --> 00:03:19,709
Stop! Will you just...

84
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:21,433
Don't touch it.

85
00:03:22,586 --> 00:03:23,986
Sorry.

86
00:03:31,495 --> 00:03:33,928
Now, remember, once we
remove these bandages,

87
00:03:33,998 --> 00:03:36,592
there's gonna be some...
Some redness, some swelling.

88
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:40,151
So, did you talk
to April last night?

89
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,419
I did.

90
00:03:41,488 --> 00:03:43,488
And? How'd it go?

91
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:46,240
Not, uh... Not
exactly as I expected.

92
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:48,526
Oh, God. She took it that hard?

93
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:52,231
Or she didn't because...

94
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:53,410
You didn't ask her, did you?

95
00:03:53,434 --> 00:03:54,811
Tatiana. You're kidding me.

96
00:03:54,835 --> 00:03:56,296
It's really not that
simple. Sure, it is.

97
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,864
You just say, "This isn't
working for me anymore.

98
00:03:57,888 --> 00:04:00,004
"I'm not happy. I
want a divorce."

99
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,389
Knock, knock! Hey.

100
00:04:01,475 --> 00:04:04,409
Oh. Well, you ready
for the unveiling?

101
00:04:04,477 --> 00:04:05,927
Four years' hard work, Avery.

102
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:07,790
Well, I'm just the surgeon.
Tatiana's had the hardest job.

103
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:10,248
This guy. Always sweet-talking.

104
00:04:10,317 --> 00:04:12,183
Forty-three
surgeries, four years,

105
00:04:12,235 --> 00:04:15,587
three months, one
week, and four days.

106
00:04:15,656 --> 00:04:18,657
Can't believe this is the last
time you'll be unwrapping my face.

107
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:23,528
Okay. Let's do it.

108
00:04:26,449 --> 00:04:27,849
Wait. I'm...

109
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:31,186
I don't think I'll
be able to look.

110
00:04:31,255 --> 00:04:33,199
Hey, what kind of
hack do you think I am?

111
00:04:33,223 --> 00:04:34,918
You are going to
want to see this.

112
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:36,257
Trust me.

113
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:43,247
How's Meredith?

114
00:04:43,316 --> 00:04:46,601
She's good, considering
it's her first week of recovery.

115
00:04:47,404 --> 00:04:49,037
Good.

116
00:04:49,106 --> 00:04:51,156
What are you up to?

117
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:52,268
You're just...

118
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,869
Mmm-hmm... You're so...

119
00:04:53,893 --> 00:04:56,506
Remember how our therapist
said that we should be more direct

120
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:58,530
with what we want? Oh.

121
00:04:58,599 --> 00:05:01,061
Maybe you should be more
direct with what you want.

122
00:05:01,085 --> 00:05:05,370
I have an hour
until my I&D case.

123
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:07,767
I'm heading to the on-call room.

124
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:08,935
Take a little nap.

125
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:10,408
Oh, yeah? Yeah.

126
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:12,410
Too bad you won't
be getting any sleep.

127
00:05:20,104 --> 00:05:22,087
I don't want to talk,
because you know what?

128
00:05:22,156 --> 00:05:23,232
I know what you're gonna say!

129
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:25,190
You're gonna say
you love me but...

130
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:26,502
You don't know
what I'm going to say!

131
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:27,575
I'm pretty sure I do.

132
00:05:27,644 --> 00:05:29,661
It doesn't matter!
You don't! Fine!

133
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:31,480
Fine, then just go ahead.

134
00:05:31,548 --> 00:05:32,875
Come... Say it.

135
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:33,939
Uh...

136
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:36,100
Oh, my God, Jackson!

137
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:39,353
God, please, would
you just say it?

138
00:05:42,859 --> 00:05:44,759
You're right. I was.

139
00:05:44,828 --> 00:05:47,072
I was gonna ask you for a
divorce when we went for dinner,

140
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:48,991
and then again when
we stayed in for dinner...

141
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,243
Yeah. And then things happened.

142
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:51,377
Yeah, well, we had sex, Jackson.

143
00:05:51,401 --> 00:05:52,495
That's what
happened. We had sex.

144
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:55,753
I was clear about this.
My mind was made up.

145
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:59,524
I knew what was best for me,
moving forward, no matter how hard.

146
00:05:59,593 --> 00:06:02,159
I knew there were things
that we couldn't repair.

147
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:03,506
I knew what I had to do.

148
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,913
And it's not clear
for me anymore.

149
00:06:05,983 --> 00:06:09,300
This... When I look at
you and I stop thinking...

150
00:06:10,571 --> 00:06:14,656
When I let myself
just be with you...

151
00:06:14,724 --> 00:06:16,553
All I'm saying is, I don't think

152
00:06:16,577 --> 00:06:18,688
that I want what I
wanted anymore.

153
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:20,344
And what I want...

154
00:06:21,982 --> 00:06:23,381
What?

155
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,953
I want you.

156
00:06:28,021 --> 00:06:29,021
Me too.

157
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,367
<i>You guys had sex. Yeah.</i>

158
00:06:48,391 --> 00:06:50,192
We did, too. It's messy.

159
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,637
Stop running away from me.

160
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:53,656
Callie... You and Arizona,
before you guys split,

161
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,747
<i>you did the
counseling thing, right?</i>

162
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:58,567
I mean, an hour
wait for a table?

163
00:07:58,595 --> 00:08:00,595
It's ridiculous. I'm hungry now.

164
00:08:01,698 --> 00:08:03,965
This was such a better idea.

165
00:08:04,034 --> 00:08:05,466
Place looks nice.

166
00:08:06,603 --> 00:08:08,203
Changed some things around, huh?

167
00:08:08,272 --> 00:08:10,372
Some new pillows.

168
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,822
I like those.

169
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:13,286
No, you don't. You
hate throw pillows.

170
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:14,637
I really do. Yeah, I know.

171
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:16,155
I'm sorry. You want
something to drink?

172
00:08:16,179 --> 00:08:17,259
Yeah.

173
00:08:20,317 --> 00:08:23,245
Oh, my God. They gave
us so many fortune cookies.

174
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:24,919
I love fortune cookies!

175
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:26,738
I know. I asked for extra.

176
00:08:28,742 --> 00:08:31,725
I'm sorry again about
last night getting cut short.

177
00:08:31,795 --> 00:08:33,640
I get it. It's okay. It's fine.

178
00:08:33,664 --> 00:08:34,904
Yeah, I know.

179
00:08:41,154 --> 00:08:42,954
And...

180
00:08:43,006 --> 00:08:44,456
Look at that.

181
00:08:52,882 --> 00:08:54,122
Amen.

182
00:08:56,219 --> 00:08:57,552
Thank you for waiting.

183
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:58,620
Mmm-hmm.

184
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:01,901
You want to know
what I was praying for?

185
00:09:01,925 --> 00:09:03,608
No, that's all right.

186
00:09:04,227 --> 00:09:05,527
Throw pillows.

187
00:09:05,595 --> 00:09:08,295
Thousands of them
just raining from the sky.

188
00:09:08,364 --> 00:09:09,708
I do not understand
their purpose.

189
00:09:09,732 --> 00:09:11,060
They have so many purposes.

190
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:12,662
They don't. They're
like a pop of color.

191
00:09:12,686 --> 00:09:14,163
They just get in the way. I
just don't understand what the...

192
00:09:14,187 --> 00:09:15,531
You, like, prop up
your arms and your feet.

193
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:16,665
Moving them around the
house. Plus, it looks nice.

194
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:17,784
You're funny.

195
00:09:17,808 --> 00:09:18,835
It's good, right?
It's really good.

196
00:09:18,859 --> 00:09:19,885
Told you you'd like this place.

197
00:09:19,909 --> 00:09:21,871
I can't believe I
never noticed it.

198
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:23,889
I probably ordered takeout
every night while you were gone.

199
00:09:23,913 --> 00:09:26,426
And I didn't realize this place
was right around the corner.

200
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:27,932
Wow. Okay.

201
00:09:28,001 --> 00:09:29,094
What?

202
00:09:29,118 --> 00:09:30,951
We just sat down to eat.

203
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,982
I thought we were
having a nice time. We are.

204
00:09:33,006 --> 00:09:34,650
So why are you gonna
ruin it by picking a fight?

205
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:36,357
No, I'm not.

206
00:09:36,426 --> 00:09:38,337
I wasn't picking a fight. I
was just talking Chinese food.

207
00:09:38,361 --> 00:09:40,127
And Jordan. And takeout.

208
00:09:40,197 --> 00:09:41,773
I am not the one
getting defensive.

209
00:09:41,797 --> 00:09:43,748
And I am? Look...

210
00:09:43,817 --> 00:09:46,217
I did not come
here to fight tonight.

211
00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:48,713
Okay. Okay?

212
00:09:50,023 --> 00:09:51,222
Okay.

213
00:09:58,698 --> 00:10:01,098
So, why did you come here?

214
00:10:05,806 --> 00:10:08,087
Throw pillows, obviously.

215
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:13,277
I saw you had a nasal
septum reconstruction

216
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:14,891
up on the board today.
Is that for Tatiana?

217
00:10:14,915 --> 00:10:16,130
Yeah. Her final surgery.

218
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:18,866
She's come such a long
way. You should be so proud.

219
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:20,952
I am.

220
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:24,405
I mean, I will be once it
all kind of comes together.

221
00:10:24,491 --> 00:10:25,857
Mmm-hmm.

222
00:10:25,925 --> 00:10:27,803
I've performed so many
surgeries on her, you know,

223
00:10:27,827 --> 00:10:31,562
that her face is just
this road map, you know,

224
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:34,665
of an incredible journey
that we've been on together.

225
00:10:37,204 --> 00:10:38,764
I'm rambling. I'll stop.

226
00:10:43,093 --> 00:10:45,226
We really should talk, though.

227
00:10:45,294 --> 00:10:47,195
We are talking.

228
00:10:47,263 --> 00:10:48,529
Yeah, I mean...

229
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:50,531
Really talk.

230
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,632
About us.

231
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:54,229
Mmm-hmm.

232
00:10:54,253 --> 00:10:56,621
Obviously it's not
easy, you know?

233
00:10:57,841 --> 00:10:59,007
I do think it's right.

234
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:00,086
If you're struggling this much,

235
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:01,453
maybe that should
tell you something.

236
00:11:01,477 --> 00:11:02,972
Maybe you should stop
before you say whatever it is...

237
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:04,896
We need to talk
about getting a divorce.

238
00:11:08,117 --> 00:11:09,350
April...

239
00:11:11,187 --> 00:11:12,427
Okay.

240
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:15,606
Come on. Don't...

241
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:20,444
We're not even living together.

242
00:11:21,331 --> 00:11:23,509
Okay, this is the first
substantial conversation

243
00:11:23,533 --> 00:11:25,066
we've had in, what, months?

244
00:11:25,135 --> 00:11:27,868
Well, that is your choice and
not mine, 'cause I've been here.

245
00:11:27,938 --> 00:11:29,615
I've been willing to
have any conversation.

246
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:31,155
Don't do that.

247
00:11:31,224 --> 00:11:32,267
Don't blame me.

248
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:33,357
I'm not blaming you.

249
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:35,106
It's not blame. It's just fact.

250
00:11:35,345 --> 00:11:36,494
I want to talk to you,

251
00:11:36,563 --> 00:11:38,240
but we're having two
different conversations

252
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:39,976
'cause I want to work on things
and you just want to end them.

253
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,744
I'm not being flip
about any of this.

254
00:11:41,768 --> 00:11:44,246
You actually believe
that I'm taking this lightly?

255
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:46,337
It just seems like you
are looking for an excuse

256
00:11:46,405 --> 00:11:48,656
to walk away instead of
putting in any of the work...

257
00:11:48,724 --> 00:11:49,884
You left me!

258
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:53,707
You walked away! You...

259
00:11:53,746 --> 00:11:56,041
You ran halfway across
the world! How co...

260
00:11:56,065 --> 00:11:58,344
'Cause I was dying, Jackson!

261
00:11:58,368 --> 00:12:01,135
Samuel died, and I died!

262
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:05,623
Until Jordan, until I was
able go over there and...

263
00:12:05,691 --> 00:12:06,958
And what?

264
00:12:08,527 --> 00:12:11,462
You think I was somehow
just fine after Samuel?

265
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:13,576
You don't think
I was dying, too?

266
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,583
No. No, okay?

267
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:17,552
You weren't. Not like me.

268
00:12:17,621 --> 00:12:20,138
You were coping.
You... You were okay.

269
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:21,940
I couldn't even...

270
00:12:22,008 --> 00:12:23,474
And then I found something.

271
00:12:23,543 --> 00:12:24,943
I found something over there

272
00:12:25,011 --> 00:12:27,145
that I needed so badly!

273
00:12:27,214 --> 00:12:29,414
And I thought that
you understood that!

274
00:12:29,483 --> 00:12:30,764
I wasn't coping.

275
00:12:32,902 --> 00:12:34,302
I was covering.

276
00:12:34,371 --> 00:12:35,611
For you. I was...

277
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:38,022
To take care of you.

278
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:41,159
And now you're
punishing me over and over

279
00:12:41,228 --> 00:12:44,862
because I dared to take
things into my own hands

280
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:47,698
because I recognized
the spiral I was falling into,

281
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,078
and I went and did
something about it?

282
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:50,212
I was putting you first.

283
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:52,548
That's what you
do in a marriage!

284
00:12:52,572 --> 00:12:54,349
Or I guess that's not
what you do. I don't...

285
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:58,342
I took care of myself
so that I would survive!

286
00:12:58,411 --> 00:13:01,212
And all that does
is make you angry.

287
00:13:01,264 --> 00:13:02,863
Look at you. What...

288
00:13:03,999 --> 00:13:05,132
What is it, Jackson?

289
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:08,135
What... What pisses
you off so much,

290
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:11,572
that I chose to go after the
thing that I needed to heal

291
00:13:11,641 --> 00:13:13,970
or that the thing I
needed wasn't you?

292
00:13:13,994 --> 00:13:15,609
The thing that I needed was you!

293
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:23,234
I survived.

294
00:13:23,937 --> 00:13:25,837
You survived.

295
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:27,721
But I do not think
we can survive this.

296
00:13:30,343 --> 00:13:32,188
No, I'm not getting
divorced, Jackson, okay?

297
00:13:32,212 --> 00:13:33,689
No one in my family
has ever been divorced.

298
00:13:33,713 --> 00:13:35,629
Everyone in my family has.

299
00:13:35,698 --> 00:13:38,666
Sometimes marriages
just don't work out.

300
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:40,045
It's not just the harder
thing sometimes.

301
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:41,297
Maybe sometimes it's healthier.

302
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:42,620
I'm not giving up on us.

303
00:13:42,689 --> 00:13:43,899
I won't. You already did.

304
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:45,556
Oh, my God! Stop saying that!

305
00:13:45,624 --> 00:13:47,553
You take for granted that
I'm just gonna wait for you,

306
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:50,544
and wait and wait,
no matter what!

307
00:13:50,613 --> 00:13:53,498
But divorce is not some
dirty word, April, not for me.

308
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:54,677
In fact, right now, it's a light

309
00:13:54,701 --> 00:13:56,141
at the end of a
really dark tunnel.

310
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:00,633
What are you doing? Really?

311
00:14:00,657 --> 00:14:02,584
That's what this
has been to you?

312
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:04,753
I'm so sorry I kept you locked
away in this prison camp!

313
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:06,138
Hey! You just want to end it?

314
00:14:06,162 --> 00:14:07,873
Huh? Is that what you're
saying? That's not what I said.

315
00:14:07,897 --> 00:14:09,942
You just want to pretend like
this... Well, what are you saying?

316
00:14:09,966 --> 00:14:11,960
You would know if you
would listen! I am listening!

317
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:13,050
What are you doing?

318
00:14:13,119 --> 00:14:14,619
I'm throwing cookies!

319
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:15,832
Why? Because!

320
00:14:15,856 --> 00:14:17,266
Because why? I don't know!

321
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:18,801
You're being
ridiculous! Stop! I know!

322
00:14:18,825 --> 00:14:20,252
Stop. I know!

323
00:14:21,678 --> 00:14:24,478
What...

324
00:14:24,547 --> 00:14:25,891
What is happening to us?

325
00:14:25,915 --> 00:14:27,165
I don't know.

326
00:14:29,569 --> 00:14:30,809
How did we get to this?

327
00:14:32,072 --> 00:14:33,121
I don't know.

328
00:14:34,857 --> 00:14:36,457
How do we make it stop?

329
00:14:55,595 --> 00:14:56,772
Wait.

330
00:14:57,998 --> 00:14:59,108
Wait. What?

331
00:14:59,132 --> 00:15:00,809
We should probably not do this.

332
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:02,345
Probably not a good idea.

333
00:15:02,369 --> 00:15:03,369
No. Yeah, absolutely.

334
00:15:03,436 --> 00:15:04,813
It's not a good idea. All right.

335
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:06,637
Yeah, yeah. Okay.

336
00:15:18,635 --> 00:15:21,068
You know what they
call that? Divorce.

337
00:15:21,137 --> 00:15:23,404
And it wasn't an ultimatum.
I gave you a choice.

338
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:26,501
Where's my
maxillofacial consult?

339
00:15:26,525 --> 00:15:28,053
On the way. GCS is 9.

340
00:15:28,077 --> 00:15:30,277
Pupils are asymmetric. We
need to establish an airway.

341
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:31,874
What do you got?
He fell 20 feet.

342
00:15:31,898 --> 00:15:33,881
C6-7 unstable fracture.

343
00:15:33,949 --> 00:15:36,595
He's breathing on his own,
but he needs a secure airway.

344
00:15:36,619 --> 00:15:38,402
Okay. Laryngoscope, please.

345
00:15:38,471 --> 00:15:40,566
Wait. Why are you here?
Airway. You paged me.

346
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:43,319
I thought you were going to the
airport, flying to Jordan with April.

347
00:15:43,343 --> 00:15:45,293
Yeah. No. Um...

348
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:47,241
Yeah, I decided
not to go, actually.

349
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,713
Uh, scope, please.

350
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,549
Is this flight 2703 to Jordan?

351
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:54,563
I need to get on that
plane. I'm sorry, sir,

352
00:15:54,587 --> 00:15:57,032
but once the doors are
officially closed, there's really...

353
00:15:57,056 --> 00:15:58,533
Please, okay? My
wife's on that flight.

354
00:15:58,557 --> 00:16:00,302
I just need to get to my
wife, so if you could just...

355
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:02,354
Oh, my God. That is so sweet.

356
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:03,706
So you'll open the doors? No.

357
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:04,790
Are you kidding me right now?

358
00:16:04,814 --> 00:16:06,108
I'm sorry. There's
nothing I can do.

359
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:08,092
Your plane's leaving. What?

360
00:16:15,124 --> 00:16:17,269
What the hell do you mean that
Owen's not gonna be there with you?

361
00:16:17,293 --> 00:16:19,355
I'm not gonna be there alone.
There's a whole unit of us.

362
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:21,813
We work together. We're friends.

363
00:16:21,881 --> 00:16:23,976
I mean, we're more than
that. We're like family.

364
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,011
We have each other's
backs. We get each other.

365
00:16:26,035 --> 00:16:27,675
Mmm-mmm. Like I
don't get you, right?

366
00:16:29,672 --> 00:16:31,800
Come with me. Come
on. It's not too late.

367
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,635
I can make a couple
phone calls. No.

368
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:35,204
We always need more
surgeons over there.

369
00:16:35,228 --> 00:16:36,922
April, no. My answer
hasn't changed.

370
00:16:36,946 --> 00:16:40,148
If you could just see what it's
like over there, the work we do.

371
00:16:40,216 --> 00:16:42,066
It's important.

372
00:16:42,134 --> 00:16:44,496
It's immediate. It's
essential. There's no filter.

373
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:47,655
There's no time to even...

374
00:16:47,724 --> 00:16:50,903
So often around here,
we, like, walk through life

375
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:52,605
and get caught
up with all this stuff.

376
00:16:52,629 --> 00:16:54,940
There's no stuff over there. Every
day, every patient has purpose.

377
00:16:54,964 --> 00:16:56,631
It has meaning.

378
00:16:59,252 --> 00:17:01,647
I want you to know it
the way that I know it.

379
00:17:01,671 --> 00:17:05,056
And I can't just pick up
and go. I have commitments.

380
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:06,285
I have people. Who? Who?

381
00:17:06,309 --> 00:17:07,820
What people do you have here

382
00:17:07,844 --> 00:17:09,621
that would prevent you from
coming overseas with me?

383
00:17:09,645 --> 00:17:10,878
Patients.

384
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:12,224
I mean, I'm not willing to just

385
00:17:12,248 --> 00:17:13,964
abandon people
that depend on me.

386
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:16,567
And I am?

387
00:17:18,221 --> 00:17:19,386
Kind of.

388
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:21,305
Kind of, yeah.

389
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:22,940
I'm still getting
a lot of necrosis.

390
00:17:23,008 --> 00:17:24,653
I'm afraid that...

391
00:17:24,677 --> 00:17:27,789
The stupid paramedian
forehead flap is dying again.

392
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:29,547
This is the second one.

393
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:32,015
I do not know why
this is happening.

394
00:17:32,085 --> 00:17:33,762
I harvested two
blood vessels this time

395
00:17:33,786 --> 00:17:36,165
just to make sure
that it wouldn't...

396
00:17:36,189 --> 00:17:39,756
I was so careful to avoid
clotting, but it's still just...

397
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:44,462
I'm sorry. We'll
figure this out.

398
00:17:44,531 --> 00:17:46,396
This isn't your fault, you know.

399
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:49,267
Maybe my face just
doesn't like forehead flaps.

400
00:17:50,153 --> 00:17:51,352
Hey.

401
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:53,988
You will figure this
out. You always do.

402
00:17:54,056 --> 00:17:56,657
It's not like we haven't
had setbacks before.

403
00:17:56,726 --> 00:17:58,587
Yeah. I know. It's just...

404
00:17:58,611 --> 00:18:00,044
Just crappy 'cause

405
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:02,362
this one's happening
right before Christmas

406
00:18:02,431 --> 00:18:06,050
when your wife's off being some
kind of superhero in a desert.

407
00:18:07,153 --> 00:18:09,654
And, I mean...

408
00:18:09,722 --> 00:18:12,740
I was around for what
happened this time last year...

409
00:18:12,808 --> 00:18:14,842
When you lost Samuel.

410
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:17,411
And I know, well...

411
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,813
Things have to be
tough for you right now.

412
00:18:23,702 --> 00:18:25,836
Come on! Just give
me a signal! Just...

413
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:28,305
Damn it!

414
00:18:28,374 --> 00:18:31,142
Come on, come on, come
on, come on, come on.

415
00:18:35,498 --> 00:18:36,998
Come on!

416
00:18:42,071 --> 00:18:43,349
Do you need more anesthetic?

417
00:18:43,373 --> 00:18:44,538
No, I'm okay.

418
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:46,185
I heard you were down here.

419
00:18:46,209 --> 00:18:47,692
What happened, baby?

420
00:18:47,744 --> 00:18:49,624
It's nothing. It was just
an accident at home.

421
00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:53,364
Have you heard from
April? Did she call you today?

422
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:55,199
She's busy over there, you know.

423
00:18:55,268 --> 00:18:58,535
I mean, she probably doesn't
even realize what day it is.

424
00:18:58,604 --> 00:19:01,421
How can I help you?
What do you need?

425
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:04,620
You know, I could use
more lidocaine with epi,

426
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:05,759
if you wouldn't mind.

427
00:19:05,828 --> 00:19:07,094
I'll find some.

428
00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:24,895
God! Oh!

429
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:54,374
It is so good to be back.

430
00:19:55,628 --> 00:19:57,206
April. I'm-I'm not working.

431
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:59,380
I'm-I'm just... I'm
not ready to work yet.

432
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:06,948
Hey. I'm gonna head in to work.

433
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:08,212
You have breakfast?

434
00:20:13,562 --> 00:20:16,962
You know, you haven't
been to church in a while.

435
00:20:17,266 --> 00:20:19,244
What do you say we go together?

436
00:20:19,268 --> 00:20:20,268
Huh?

437
00:20:21,604 --> 00:20:22,736
Hey.

438
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,440
Look at me, sweetheart.

439
00:20:27,043 --> 00:20:28,043
Hmm?

440
00:20:30,146 --> 00:20:31,386
What if we...

441
00:20:33,349 --> 00:20:34,849
Try again?

442
00:20:35,451 --> 00:20:37,284
Mmm-hmm?

443
00:20:37,353 --> 00:20:39,513
Let's try for another baby.

444
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:42,956
Why would you say that?

445
00:20:43,792 --> 00:20:44,920
No, I just want...

446
00:20:44,944 --> 00:20:45,944
What?

447
00:20:46,011 --> 00:20:47,627
What do you want?

448
00:20:47,696 --> 00:20:49,696
April... Screw you.

449
00:20:49,765 --> 00:20:52,617
Screw you for even
suggesting that.

450
00:20:52,685 --> 00:20:53,967
Screw you.

451
00:20:54,937 --> 00:20:56,170
Okay.

452
00:20:58,174 --> 00:20:59,372
All right.

453
00:21:00,109 --> 00:21:01,375
I'll go.

454
00:21:05,698 --> 00:21:07,276
I'll just go in to work.

455
00:21:17,059 --> 00:21:18,937
Get off of me! Okay,
just calm down. I know.

456
00:21:18,961 --> 00:21:20,205
Get off! Warren!

457
00:21:20,229 --> 00:21:21,707
I was just marking
her face for surgery.

458
00:21:21,731 --> 00:21:23,146
That marker reeks!

459
00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:24,409
All right, guys... I don't
want it near my face!

460
00:21:24,433 --> 00:21:25,577
She keeps trying to
take off her bandages.

461
00:21:25,601 --> 00:21:26,962
I'm not doing this
anymore! I can't! I'm done!

462
00:21:26,986 --> 00:21:28,764
All right, Warren,
Wilson, give us a minute.

463
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:30,087
Hey, Tatiana, what is going on?

464
00:21:31,257 --> 00:21:33,190
What is it? I had
a life before this!

465
00:21:33,259 --> 00:21:34,792
I had a life!

466
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:37,506
Then I was in the wrong
place at the wrong time,

467
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:41,281
and now my face is
melted off of my face!

468
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:44,952
It's been a year and a half,
and there's so much more to go.

469
00:21:45,021 --> 00:21:46,464
So many more surgeries!

470
00:21:46,488 --> 00:21:48,022
And with each
one, you get better.

471
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:49,790
This is my life now...

472
00:21:49,858 --> 00:21:52,092
These walls, this bed, you!

473
00:21:53,029 --> 00:21:54,595
I want it back.

474
00:21:54,663 --> 00:21:57,331
I want to go back
to who I was before.

475
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,599
I know.

476
00:21:58,667 --> 00:22:00,307
Go back. I know.

477
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:15,660
Hey. Good morning. Hey, morning.

478
00:22:15,684 --> 00:22:16,924
Morning, sir. Yeah.

479
00:22:16,953 --> 00:22:17,953
Mmm-hmm.

480
00:22:31,734 --> 00:22:33,400
Oh! Hey. What you doing?

481
00:22:33,469 --> 00:22:36,003
Oh! Um... Uh...

482
00:22:36,072 --> 00:22:37,632
We're dancing.

483
00:22:37,656 --> 00:22:39,136
Dance. Right on.

484
00:22:40,026 --> 00:22:41,325
Right on.

485
00:22:42,628 --> 00:22:43,660
Oh!

486
00:22:43,729 --> 00:22:45,449
Hi. APRIL: Hi.

487
00:22:45,931 --> 00:22:47,631
Well, who died?

488
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:48,861
What? Nobody.

489
00:22:48,885 --> 00:22:50,195
We're just dancing.
I only dance it out

490
00:22:50,219 --> 00:22:51,585
when something bad happens.

491
00:22:51,654 --> 00:22:53,031
No. JACKSON: Not today.

492
00:22:53,055 --> 00:22:54,088
Did someone...

493
00:22:54,157 --> 00:22:55,157
Did I leave my...

494
00:22:55,758 --> 00:22:56,857
Well, all right!

495
00:22:56,926 --> 00:22:58,003
Mmm-hmm. Hey.

496
00:22:58,027 --> 00:22:59,087
No.

497
00:23:02,732 --> 00:23:03,732
What the hell?

498
00:23:06,068 --> 00:23:07,788
Oh!

499
00:23:09,238 --> 00:23:10,304
Hey!

500
00:23:10,372 --> 00:23:12,206
Hey!

501
00:23:12,274 --> 00:23:13,440
Oh! All right. All right.

502
00:23:13,508 --> 00:23:15,175
We celebrating the new baby?

503
00:23:15,244 --> 00:23:16,627
What? Wait. What?

504
00:23:16,679 --> 00:23:18,690
What did she say? Torres?

505
00:23:18,714 --> 00:23:20,146
What did you say?

506
00:23:21,367 --> 00:23:22,650
Ah, well...

507
00:23:22,718 --> 00:23:24,479
I'm so sorry.

508
00:23:24,503 --> 00:23:27,304
We are actually
celebrating a baby.

509
00:23:27,373 --> 00:23:28,517
I am pregnant.

510
00:23:28,541 --> 00:23:29,807
Oh, my God!

511
00:23:29,859 --> 00:23:31,269
Holy crap. JACKSON: Yeah, yeah.

512
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:33,988
- Congratulations.
- Thank you!

513
00:23:34,012 --> 00:23:35,573
Congratulations!

514
00:23:35,597 --> 00:23:36,897
Yeah!

515
00:23:36,965 --> 00:23:38,265
Hey, hey.

516
00:23:38,334 --> 00:23:40,112
Thank you! Thank you!

517
00:23:42,171 --> 00:23:43,603
Work it out.

518
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:46,040
No, I don't think so.
I'll just sprain my ankle.

519
00:23:51,063 --> 00:23:52,674
It's one small concession.

520
00:23:52,698 --> 00:23:54,264
It's not small.

521
00:23:54,333 --> 00:23:56,311
Look, we are about
to tell my parents

522
00:23:56,335 --> 00:23:58,919
that we got married, eloped.

523
00:23:58,987 --> 00:24:01,755
They wanted to be at my wedding.

524
00:24:01,824 --> 00:24:03,318
They thought they
were at my wedding.

525
00:24:03,342 --> 00:24:05,269
I'm just not comfortable
with it. I mean, you know that.

526
00:24:05,293 --> 00:24:07,306
I know that you're
not religious.

527
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:10,297
So why are you asking me
to lead your family in prayer?

528
00:24:10,366 --> 00:24:13,278
Because they're
predisposed to not like you.

529
00:24:13,302 --> 00:24:14,779
You're marrying a rich,
handsome surgeon.

530
00:24:14,803 --> 00:24:16,963
Stop it. I know.

531
00:24:17,506 --> 00:24:18,746
We embarrassed them.

532
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,290
And we will apologize for that.

533
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:21,492
Sincerely, okay?

534
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,855
But I'm not gonna
change who I am

535
00:24:22,879 --> 00:24:24,422
just to get your parents
to like me. No, no, no.

536
00:24:24,446 --> 00:24:26,091
No, I don't want you
to change who you are.

537
00:24:26,115 --> 00:24:27,993
You want me to lie. No. Come on.

538
00:24:28,017 --> 00:24:30,817
It's... It's a gesture
of good faith.

539
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:32,485
My gesture of good faith

540
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:33,699
is being a wonderful husband

541
00:24:33,723 --> 00:24:35,405
to their beautiful daughter.

542
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:36,840
It's one day.

543
00:24:37,743 --> 00:24:39,776
One prayer.

544
00:24:39,845 --> 00:24:42,629
Not like I'm asking
you to go get baptized.

545
00:24:42,698 --> 00:24:44,631
I'm not.

546
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,299
Their first real
impression of me.

547
00:24:46,368 --> 00:24:48,102
What happens
after, at the holidays

548
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:50,237
when I'm suddenly not praying?

549
00:24:51,908 --> 00:24:53,374
Well...

550
00:24:53,442 --> 00:24:54,719
Are you kidding me? You...

551
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:56,054
<i>Attention, ladies
and gentlemen...</i>

552
00:24:56,078 --> 00:24:57,322
You want this to go
on for how long exactly?

553
00:24:57,346 --> 00:24:59,073
No, I just... I just want them

554
00:24:59,097 --> 00:25:01,209
to like you and accept us.

555
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:03,150
Well, if you respect
me, they will.

556
00:25:03,235 --> 00:25:05,080
Jackson. Please. I...
You know what? No.

557
00:25:05,104 --> 00:25:06,636
April, this conversation's over.

558
00:25:08,574 --> 00:25:10,207
Excuse me?

559
00:25:10,276 --> 00:25:12,442
You knew who I was
when we got married.

560
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:13,726
Okay? We talked about this.

561
00:25:13,796 --> 00:25:16,163
We negotiated our
whole wedding around it.

562
00:25:16,231 --> 00:25:17,643
I thought that we
agreed that we would

563
00:25:17,667 --> 00:25:19,010
respect each
other's differences.

564
00:25:19,034 --> 00:25:20,200
So, yeah, for me,

565
00:25:20,269 --> 00:25:22,269
this conversation's over.

566
00:25:22,338 --> 00:25:23,715
Just over? Yeah.

567
00:25:23,739 --> 00:25:25,405
I'm done with it.

568
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:31,245
Maybe I didn't...

569
00:25:31,313 --> 00:25:33,325
Maybe I didn't know
who I was marrying.

570
00:25:33,349 --> 00:25:35,582
Really? Okay. Yeah,
because you know what?

571
00:25:35,651 --> 00:25:37,546
The way that you're
speaking to me right now,

572
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:39,514
the way that you're
acting, is not who I married.

573
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:41,871
Yet I could say the same thing.

574
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:45,837
You're right, because
you know what?

575
00:25:45,861 --> 00:25:49,362
We thought about it
for all of, like, 18 hours.

576
00:25:49,431 --> 00:25:52,132
What are you saying? You
wish we hadn't got married?

577
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,812
No.

578
00:25:53,836 --> 00:25:55,230
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
may I have your attention?</i>

579
00:25:55,254 --> 00:25:56,732
<i>We are now beginning
our initial descent</i>

580
00:25:56,756 --> 00:25:58,834
<i>into Port Columbus
International Airport.</i>

581
00:25:58,858 --> 00:26:00,098
<i>Please raise your tray tables</i>

582
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:02,959
<i>and place your seats
in the upright position.</i>

583
00:26:03,028 --> 00:26:05,188
My parents are picking us up.

584
00:26:05,648 --> 00:26:06,959
You want the rest of my peanuts?

585
00:26:06,983 --> 00:26:09,264
I'm allergic to peanuts.

586
00:26:11,419 --> 00:26:13,859
It looks like a lovely wedding.

587
00:26:13,923 --> 00:26:15,839
Congratulations again.

588
00:26:15,908 --> 00:26:18,942
She's a really beautiful bride.

589
00:26:21,364 --> 00:26:22,891
Hey, what's wrong?
Are you feeling pain?

590
00:26:22,915 --> 00:26:25,331
No. No. I'm not.

591
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,616
It's just...

592
00:26:26,685 --> 00:26:29,069
Look at me. I'm hideous.

593
00:26:29,138 --> 00:26:31,138
No. Do not say that.

594
00:26:31,206 --> 00:26:32,539
No one will ever look at me

595
00:26:32,607 --> 00:26:34,675
the way you're looking
at April in these pictures.

596
00:26:34,743 --> 00:26:36,109
Tatiana, you're wrong.

597
00:26:36,178 --> 00:26:37,544
Please. Okay?

598
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:40,964
I look at you, and I see
such incredible strength.

599
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,867
I see bravery.

600
00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:46,837
I see humor and persistence...

601
00:26:48,307 --> 00:26:50,975
Beauty.

602
00:26:51,043 --> 00:26:53,554
Now, these surgeries, they're
gonna give you back a face,

603
00:26:53,578 --> 00:26:56,647
but don't you dare
for a single moment

604
00:26:56,716 --> 00:26:58,997
think that you're
not already beautiful.

605
00:27:06,725 --> 00:27:08,605
Oh, I can't believe
we're doing this.

606
00:27:08,827 --> 00:27:09,842
I can.

607
00:27:11,113 --> 00:27:12,162
You may now kiss.

608
00:27:25,194 --> 00:27:27,094
I know you think it's silly.

609
00:27:27,162 --> 00:27:28,439
Well, I didn't say that.

610
00:27:28,463 --> 00:27:30,630
But I'm serious, okay?

611
00:27:30,699 --> 00:27:32,148
No premarital sex.

612
00:27:32,217 --> 00:27:34,663
How serious? Like
"absolutely not" serious

613
00:27:34,687 --> 00:27:38,087
or "I could be
convinced" serious?

614
00:27:42,161 --> 00:27:45,162
We will survive one more night.

615
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:46,507
Ah! Speak for yourself.

616
00:27:46,531 --> 00:27:48,465
If we wait... Mmm-hmm.

617
00:27:48,533 --> 00:27:52,035
Our wedding night
will be so amazing.

618
00:27:52,104 --> 00:27:54,015
And tonight could also be

619
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:55,105
so amazing.

620
00:28:01,129 --> 00:28:02,273
Okay. Mmm-hmm.

621
00:28:02,297 --> 00:28:03,977
Okay. Mmm-hmm.

622
00:28:05,084 --> 00:28:06,449
You...

623
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:07,851
What's that?

624
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,069
Good night, Jackson.

625
00:28:22,935 --> 00:28:24,701
I'm gonna go now.

626
00:28:44,106 --> 00:28:45,738
Good night, Jackson.

627
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:46,957
You put the chain on?

628
00:28:47,009 --> 00:28:48,403
I'll see you in the morning.

629
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:54,080
All right.

630
00:28:58,303 --> 00:28:59,303
Forget something?

631
00:29:06,562 --> 00:29:08,607
What time? SALES
CLERK: What about this one?

632
00:29:08,631 --> 00:29:12,232
I really have my heart set
on getting married in white.

633
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:14,334
The wedding dress
you're wearing is gorgeous.

634
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:16,148
I know a cleaner who
can get that stain out.

635
00:29:16,172 --> 00:29:18,372
Yeah, thank you, but
I need a new dress.

636
00:29:18,407 --> 00:29:19,700
I'll see what I
have in the back.

637
00:29:19,724 --> 00:29:21,770
Thank you. JACKSON: Thank you.

638
00:29:21,794 --> 00:29:23,705
Yes, thank you. Bye.

639
00:29:23,729 --> 00:29:25,195
All right.

640
00:29:25,264 --> 00:29:27,075
We've got ourselves
a justice of the peace.

641
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:29,044
Tomorrow afternoon,
he will marry us.

642
00:29:29,068 --> 00:29:31,101
A justice of the peace?

643
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:32,569
Okay, so, uh...

644
00:29:33,405 --> 00:29:34,838
Our wedding will be...

645
00:29:34,907 --> 00:29:36,073
Legal. Yeah.

646
00:29:36,141 --> 00:29:37,474
He's got a license.

647
00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:39,826
He's not an Elvis or a pirate

648
00:29:39,895 --> 00:29:42,011
or a cartoon character.

649
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,713
I... I had just

650
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:46,249
really hoped that
we'd find a minister.

651
00:29:46,318 --> 00:29:47,838
Someone
nondenominational, obviously,

652
00:29:47,886 --> 00:29:49,765
but, you know, just someone
who's at least been ordained.

653
00:29:49,789 --> 00:29:51,738
April, I'm not religious.

654
00:29:51,807 --> 00:29:52,939
No, I know, I know.

655
00:29:53,008 --> 00:29:54,219
Just having someone
with some sort of

656
00:29:54,243 --> 00:29:55,575
relationship with God marry us

657
00:29:55,643 --> 00:29:57,027
is kind of important to me.

658
00:29:57,096 --> 00:30:00,041
I mean, even finding this guy
wasn't easy on such short notice.

659
00:30:00,065 --> 00:30:02,494
I mean, having a wedding
without a lot of God talk

660
00:30:02,518 --> 00:30:04,758
is kind of important to me.

661
00:30:05,954 --> 00:30:07,621
I always had such,
like, a clear idea

662
00:30:07,689 --> 00:30:10,490
of what my wedding
would look like.

663
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:13,071
Want me to bring you back
to the barn, or were you...

664
00:30:13,095 --> 00:30:16,463
No! Stop it, Jackson. No.

665
00:30:19,368 --> 00:30:22,202
I just want God at my wedding.

666
00:30:22,271 --> 00:30:24,955
I want him there for the
most important day of my life.

667
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:26,902
Well, you know that
after we get married,

668
00:30:26,926 --> 00:30:30,005
I'm not gonna turn into
this churchgoing guy.

669
00:30:30,029 --> 00:30:31,673
You know, I watch
football on Sundays.

670
00:30:31,697 --> 00:30:34,114
You are not
changing who you are,

671
00:30:34,182 --> 00:30:36,299
and I do not want you to.

672
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:41,404
But you can't expect me
to change who I am, either.

673
00:30:41,473 --> 00:30:42,705
How's this one?

674
00:30:44,943 --> 00:30:46,410
Right idea, wrong color.

675
00:30:50,415 --> 00:30:52,215
Okay. Yeah?

676
00:30:52,283 --> 00:30:54,829
I'll make some phone calls, and
we'll find an ordained minister.

677
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:56,293
Thank you. Mmm-hmm.

678
00:30:59,074 --> 00:31:00,368
Did you see what
we just did there?

679
00:31:00,392 --> 00:31:02,259
We disagreed. We discussed.

680
00:31:02,327 --> 00:31:03,994
We compromised.

681
00:31:04,062 --> 00:31:05,840
We are pretty amazing
at this marriage thing.

682
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:07,491
- We are.
- This one?

683
00:31:07,515 --> 00:31:09,675
Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh!

684
00:31:09,702 --> 00:31:11,729
No, no, no, no, no! Don't
look! It's bad luck! It's bad luck!

685
00:31:11,753 --> 00:31:13,670
Yes, yes, yes!

686
00:31:18,477 --> 00:31:20,237
No, no, wait. You
can't steal all my fries.

687
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:22,795
Sure, I can. What's mine is
yours. What's yours is mine.

688
00:31:22,864 --> 00:31:24,781
We're not married yet.

689
00:31:25,934 --> 00:31:27,011
Crap. Sorry. Crap, crap, crap.

690
00:31:27,035 --> 00:31:28,335
Oh, no! Ah!

691
00:31:28,403 --> 00:31:30,070
You know what?
No more fries for you.

692
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:31,221
It was an accident.

693
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:32,639
No, no more.

694
00:31:33,809 --> 00:31:35,742
Hey.

695
00:31:35,811 --> 00:31:38,711
Where are we gonna live? After?

696
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:42,081
Well, I was thinking...
What about my place?

697
00:31:42,717 --> 00:31:44,083
Absolutely.

698
00:31:45,254 --> 00:31:46,847
Really? Yeah. It's way nicer.

699
00:31:46,871 --> 00:31:49,005
It's bigger. It's
perfect. Great.

700
00:31:49,074 --> 00:31:51,074
But I'm not changing my name.

701
00:31:51,143 --> 00:31:52,637
What? Avery's a great name.

702
00:31:52,661 --> 00:31:54,061
So is Kepner.
You want to take it?

703
00:31:54,113 --> 00:31:55,913
Sure. Really?

704
00:31:55,981 --> 00:31:57,442
No. No, I'm not
changing my name.

705
00:31:58,584 --> 00:32:00,050
Okay.

706
00:32:00,118 --> 00:32:01,930
I didn't expect you to, either.

707
00:32:01,954 --> 00:32:03,798
That's not really
a thing for me.

708
00:32:03,822 --> 00:32:05,722
It's not? No, definitely not.

709
00:32:07,209 --> 00:32:08,992
What?

710
00:32:10,295 --> 00:32:12,713
Holy crap. We did this!

711
00:32:12,781 --> 00:32:14,741
We are doing this.
We're doing this.

712
00:32:46,682 --> 00:32:48,376
<i>I love you. I always have.</i>

713
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,466
Even the things
I don't like, I love.

714
00:32:50,535 --> 00:32:51,801
You're getting married.

715
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:55,466
Unless you can give
me a reason not to?

716
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:57,368
Look, we're not doing
this anymore, okay?

717
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:59,370
No more screwing in closets.
No more screwing anywhere.

718
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:01,939
I told you, last time
was the last time.

719
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:05,014
Hey. What's wrong?

720
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:07,833
I am supposed to do a
facial reanimation surgery.

721
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:10,202
A procedure Sloan practically
invented my third year.

722
00:33:10,272 --> 00:33:12,083
Done it with him like
a handful of times.

723
00:33:12,107 --> 00:33:14,124
I mean, I never...

724
00:33:14,193 --> 00:33:15,587
There's no way I can
do this on my own.

725
00:33:15,611 --> 00:33:17,338
Of course you can. No,
you haven't seen him do it.

726
00:33:17,362 --> 00:33:19,696
He's brilliant, okay,
and so precise.

727
00:33:19,764 --> 00:33:21,497
I just needed more time.

728
00:33:21,566 --> 00:33:23,311
You can do this, Jackson.

729
00:33:23,335 --> 00:33:25,735
April, what if I can't?
What if I make her worse?

730
00:33:25,804 --> 00:33:29,206
This woman's counting on me,
and I promised that I could help.

731
00:33:29,274 --> 00:33:31,625
Then you will. You will.

732
00:33:32,443 --> 00:33:34,394
I know you will.

733
00:33:34,463 --> 00:33:37,943
You are not a person who
makes promises he doesn't keep.

734
00:33:39,535 --> 00:33:41,379
Okay, let's push 10
of morphine. Yeah.

735
00:33:41,403 --> 00:33:42,936
What do we got?

736
00:33:43,004 --> 00:33:44,504
Tatiana Flauto, 30s.

737
00:33:44,573 --> 00:33:46,956
Some psycho threw
acid on her face.

738
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:48,753
Police got him, though.

739
00:33:48,777 --> 00:33:50,505
A good Samaritan gave
her a towel with ice in it

740
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:51,790
before the paramedics got there.

741
00:33:51,814 --> 00:33:53,346
And it adhered to the burns.

742
00:33:53,415 --> 00:33:55,043
We haven't been
able to see underneath.

743
00:33:55,067 --> 00:33:57,161
Right. All right, let's start
with a bottle of saline, please.

744
00:33:57,185 --> 00:33:59,385
No. Thank you.

745
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:01,899
Hi. Tatiana, is it?
My name is Dr. Avery.

746
00:34:01,923 --> 00:34:03,818
I'd like to wet this
towel with saline

747
00:34:03,842 --> 00:34:05,019
so it'll come off easier, okay?

748
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:06,104
Will you let me do that?

749
00:34:06,128 --> 00:34:07,371
I'm scared, I'm scared! Okay.

750
00:34:07,395 --> 00:34:09,140
I know. I know. It's
okay. It's all right.

751
00:34:09,164 --> 00:34:10,975
You're safe now,
okay? You're safe here.

752
00:34:10,999 --> 00:34:12,460
I just need you to keep still

753
00:34:12,484 --> 00:34:13,761
so that I can get a
look at what's going on.

754
00:34:13,785 --> 00:34:14,846
All right? No, no, no!

755
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:16,114
I know. It's okay. You're okay.

756
00:34:16,138 --> 00:34:17,615
No, no, no! You're
okay. I'm gonna help you.

757
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:19,322
Here comes the saline.

758
00:34:19,391 --> 00:34:21,341
Okay. Here we
go. No, no, no, no.

759
00:34:21,409 --> 00:34:23,129
All right, it's
okay. No! No! No!

760
00:34:23,178 --> 00:34:24,388
Okay. Okay. RICHARD: Okay.

761
00:34:24,412 --> 00:34:26,090
- No, no, no!
- Really good.

762
00:34:26,114 --> 00:34:27,558
Now we got to remove
this towel, okay?

763
00:34:27,582 --> 00:34:29,026
We're gonna get
started. It's gonna hurt.

764
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:30,561
So I need you to take a
deep breath for me, okay?

765
00:34:30,585 --> 00:34:32,013
Deep breath.

766
00:34:32,037 --> 00:34:33,369
Here we go. All right. Okay.

767
00:34:33,438 --> 00:34:35,021
No! No!

768
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:36,189
It's okay.

769
00:34:38,894 --> 00:34:40,814
You're doing great. Okay.

770
00:34:40,845 --> 00:34:42,645
All done. You did great.

771
00:34:42,731 --> 00:34:43,897
You did great.

772
00:34:43,965 --> 00:34:46,060
We need to get Sloan
down here immediately.

773
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:48,835
Sloan is on a plane
to Idaho right now.

774
00:34:49,737 --> 00:34:50,803
Can you handle this?

775
00:34:50,872 --> 00:34:52,583
Breathe. What is
it? What's wrong?

776
00:34:52,607 --> 00:34:54,069
It's too bad! You can't
fix my face! No, no.

777
00:34:54,093 --> 00:34:55,370
No, no, no, no. No, no, no!

778
00:34:55,394 --> 00:34:58,373
No, Tatiana, hey. I know
that we just met, all right?

779
00:34:58,397 --> 00:35:02,148
But what you don't know is that
you and I, we are a team now.

780
00:35:02,217 --> 00:35:03,728
It's gonna be you and me.

781
00:35:03,752 --> 00:35:04,829
We're gonna get through
this together, all right?

782
00:35:04,853 --> 00:35:06,030
I'm not gonna lie. It's
not gonna be easy,

783
00:35:06,054 --> 00:35:07,215
and it's not gonna be quick,

784
00:35:07,239 --> 00:35:09,183
but I'm gonna be right
here the entire time, okay?

785
00:35:09,207 --> 00:35:11,624
I will not leave your side.

786
00:35:12,194 --> 00:35:13,560
I promise you.

787
00:35:14,045 --> 00:35:15,645
Okay?

788
00:35:15,713 --> 00:35:17,030
All right.

789
00:35:17,098 --> 00:35:19,627
Let's get Mepitel and
Xeroform, please. Oh!

790
00:35:19,651 --> 00:35:21,217
<i>Jackson, hey.</i>

791
00:35:21,936 --> 00:35:23,987
It's okay. Really.

792
00:35:24,056 --> 00:35:26,136
I lost some friends that day.

793
00:35:27,075 --> 00:35:28,507
I hate Sloan.

794
00:35:28,577 --> 00:35:30,755
Even when I'm perfect, he
talks to me like I'm an idiot.

795
00:35:30,779 --> 00:35:33,819
Well, try spending a day in the
ER with Dr. Major Owen Hunt.

796
00:35:33,848 --> 00:35:35,147
That man is dark.

797
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:37,567
He is a dark,
pig-stabbing, scary man.

798
00:35:39,204 --> 00:35:40,519
What?

799
00:35:40,589 --> 00:35:41,988
What's the matter?

800
00:35:42,958 --> 00:35:45,275
This is where Reed was shot...

801
00:35:47,412 --> 00:35:49,690
Where I found her. I slipped
in her blood right there.

802
00:35:49,714 --> 00:35:51,714
I haven't been back here since.

803
00:35:54,786 --> 00:35:58,026
There's an elevator upstairs
near where Charles died.

804
00:35:59,024 --> 00:36:00,891
I never use it.

805
00:36:05,964 --> 00:36:07,163
Hey.

806
00:36:07,232 --> 00:36:08,732
You okay? Hey.

807
00:36:10,268 --> 00:36:11,334
Oh, okay.

808
00:36:12,471 --> 00:36:14,404
I know. I know.

809
00:36:14,473 --> 00:36:16,651
Okay? We're here. We're okay.

810
00:36:16,675 --> 00:36:18,691
I had a gun pointed at me.

811
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,776
I know. I know.

812
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:22,762
My life flashed before my eyes.

813
00:36:22,831 --> 00:36:25,631
It... It... It really
did. Shh... Okay.

814
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:27,267
And it was so...

815
00:36:28,903 --> 00:36:30,236
Boring!

816
00:36:32,874 --> 00:36:36,509
I just kept thinking, "I
don't want to die a virgin."

817
00:36:37,879 --> 00:36:39,345
Oh.

818
00:36:39,414 --> 00:36:41,134
You can fix that.

819
00:36:42,618 --> 00:36:44,550
Was that a proposition?

820
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:46,185
No, I meant... Oh, oh!

821
00:36:46,254 --> 00:36:47,915
No! No, no, no,
no. I didn't mean...

822
00:36:47,939 --> 00:36:49,305
No, I... No. I was...

823
00:36:49,374 --> 00:36:50,668
I... It was a joke. Yeah.

824
00:36:50,692 --> 00:36:52,291
I was making a
totally stupid joke.

825
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,521
Yeah, it wasn't good. Yeah.

826
00:36:53,545 --> 00:36:54,911
Okay. I'm...

827
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:57,958
What? Good luck with Sloan.

828
00:36:57,982 --> 00:36:59,415
Mmm. Mmm-hmm.

829
00:37:02,537 --> 00:37:04,404
Well, that girl is weird.

830
00:37:08,176 --> 00:37:09,959
I'm a virgin. Yes. So what?

831
00:37:10,028 --> 00:37:11,406
<i>It's not something
I talk about, okay?</i>

832
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:13,208
<i>We all have things
we don't talk about.</i>

833
00:37:13,232 --> 00:37:15,392
She thinks your
husband walks on water.

834
00:37:16,768 --> 00:37:18,346
Cincinnati, Ohio. Pediatrics.

835
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:20,203
Thank you. Who's next?

836
00:37:21,005 --> 00:37:23,906
Uh, I'll go.

837
00:37:23,975 --> 00:37:26,242
Charles Percy,
Brookings, South Dakota.

838
00:37:26,311 --> 00:37:28,144
I want to be a trauma surgeon.

839
00:37:28,213 --> 00:37:30,513
Or maybe vascular.

840
00:37:30,582 --> 00:37:32,148
Or, like, uh...

841
00:37:33,218 --> 00:37:35,218
I don't know, actually.

842
00:37:35,287 --> 00:37:37,932
All right, well, you've got a lot
of time to figure that one out.

843
00:37:37,956 --> 00:37:40,256
Who's next?

844
00:37:40,325 --> 00:37:42,858
Right here. Jackson Avery,
originally from Boston...

845
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:44,072
Hold on. What?

846
00:37:44,096 --> 00:37:46,196
Like "Harper Avery" Avery?

847
00:37:47,466 --> 00:37:48,631
Uh...

848
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:50,811
Yeah, actually. Anyway...

849
00:37:50,835 --> 00:37:52,913
So you're, like,
born to the throne.

850
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:54,248
You know what? I wouldn't...

851
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:56,139
Do you know a Catherine
Avery, the urologist?

852
00:37:56,208 --> 00:37:57,607
I do, actually.

853
00:37:57,675 --> 00:37:59,620
Are you writing this down?

854
00:37:59,644 --> 00:38:01,456
She's just, like, amazing. Are
you going into urology, too?

855
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,246
No. Cardiothoracic all the way.

856
00:38:03,315 --> 00:38:04,680
Can I be done now?

857
00:38:04,749 --> 00:38:05,989
I'll go!

858
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:08,485
Hi. I'm April Kepner.

859
00:38:08,553 --> 00:38:11,265
I'm from Ohio, and I'm super
excited to be near the ocean,

860
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:13,234
although I don't really know
how I feel about the rain yet.

861
00:38:13,258 --> 00:38:14,591
As far as specialty goes,

862
00:38:14,659 --> 00:38:15,736
I'm looking for
something with set hours

863
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,038
so that I can raise
kids eventually...

864
00:38:18,062 --> 00:38:19,362
Two boys and a girl.

865
00:38:19,431 --> 00:38:21,542
So I'm thinking plastics,
urology, proctology.

866
00:38:21,566 --> 00:38:24,084
<i>We talk about the
mechanism of injury...</i>

867
00:38:24,152 --> 00:38:26,302
<i>About where it all started.</i>

868
00:38:26,371 --> 00:38:29,455
<i>But the truth is,
it's sort of a myth.</i>

869
00:38:29,523 --> 00:38:33,109
<i>We can't boil every injury
down to one single blow.</i>

870
00:39:10,798 --> 00:39:13,565
This is one of the simpler
divorces I've seen, actually.

871
00:39:19,658 --> 00:39:20,778
You want this?

872
00:39:23,979 --> 00:39:26,179
Do you really want this?

873
00:39:37,525 --> 00:39:38,757
Okay.

874
00:39:38,827 --> 00:39:40,827
<i>What hurts us is cumulative.</i>

875
00:39:40,895 --> 00:39:42,962
<i>It happens over time.</i>

876
00:39:43,031 --> 00:39:45,632
<i>We absorb blow after blow,</i>

877
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:50,019
<i>shock after shock,
painful hit after hit.</i>

878
00:40:13,144 --> 00:40:14,711
Is there anything else?

879
00:40:14,779 --> 00:40:16,019
Uh. That's it. No.

880
00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:17,690
Okay, then.

881
00:40:24,355 --> 00:40:26,088
<i>But even then,</i>

882
00:40:26,157 --> 00:40:29,208
<i>even if we know
exactly how we got here,</i>

883
00:40:29,277 --> 00:40:31,343
<i>it doesn't mean we can fix it.</i>

884
00:40:31,412 --> 00:40:33,452
Too late to back out?
Are you kidding me?

885
00:40:33,498 --> 00:40:36,582
Ugh. Timothy and I had
a huge fight this morning.

886
00:40:36,651 --> 00:40:38,017
It was probably my fault.

887
00:40:38,086 --> 00:40:40,169
Well, yeah, with that
mouth, probably was.

888
00:40:40,238 --> 00:40:41,938
Look, you guys are
gonna fight, okay?

889
00:40:42,007 --> 00:40:44,807
You'll probably have that
same fight for 50 years.

890
00:40:44,876 --> 00:40:47,843
But you just can't let it become
bigger than the two of you.

891
00:40:47,912 --> 00:40:49,757
So, in other words,
marriage is hard,

892
00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:52,026
but not as hard as getting
acid thrown in your face?

893
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:55,284
Yes. This mouth. You
see? Four years of this.

894
00:40:55,353 --> 00:40:58,004
And yet you still agreed
to walk me down the aisle.

895
00:40:58,072 --> 00:41:00,272
You kept every
promise you made to me.

896
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:02,999
Thank you.

897
00:41:03,044 --> 00:41:04,044
Mmm-hmm.

898
00:41:06,263 --> 00:41:07,824
I'm sorry about you and April.

899
00:41:07,848 --> 00:41:08,915
No.

900
00:41:08,984 --> 00:41:11,550
Today's about you, okay?

901
00:41:11,619 --> 00:41:13,402
Let's get you married. Hmm?

902
00:41:15,339 --> 00:41:16,606
For you.

903
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:19,709
<i>You can't heal every wound.</i>

904
00:41:20,912 --> 00:41:22,211
<i>And that's okay.</i>

905
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:24,347
<i>I have to believe it's okay.</i>

906
00:41:26,818 --> 00:41:29,118
Hey!

907
00:41:29,187 --> 00:41:31,466
Oh, I wasn't sure what you
would be in the mood for,

908
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:33,167
so I kind of got everything.

909
00:41:33,191 --> 00:41:36,726
Champagne,
tequila, pinot noir...

910
00:41:36,795 --> 00:41:38,227
Pick your poison.

911
00:41:38,997 --> 00:41:40,062
No, thanks.

912
00:41:40,131 --> 00:41:41,897
Ah! What's happening?

913
00:41:41,966 --> 00:41:44,077
Did you already start
drinking? Are you drunk?

914
00:41:44,101 --> 00:41:45,618
What? I'm...

915
00:41:46,988 --> 00:41:48,587
Hungry, maybe. What?

916
00:41:48,656 --> 00:41:50,167
You just signed divorce papers,

917
00:41:50,191 --> 00:41:51,486
and you don't want a drink?

918
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:54,390
What are you... What
are you, pregnant?

919
00:41:55,797 --> 00:41:56,846
What?

920
00:41:58,282 --> 00:41:59,362
Oh!

921
00:42:00,134 --> 00:42:01,267
April.

922
00:42:01,336 --> 00:42:02,902
<i>I have to believe that</i>

923
00:42:02,970 --> 00:42:05,405
<i>even if something seems
like it cannot be fixed...</i>

924
00:42:08,093 --> 00:42:11,728
According to the test
I took this morning,

925
00:42:11,796 --> 00:42:13,462
yeah, actually.

926
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,734
I think I am.

927
00:42:17,802 --> 00:42:19,652
<i>It doesn't mean it's broken.</i>
