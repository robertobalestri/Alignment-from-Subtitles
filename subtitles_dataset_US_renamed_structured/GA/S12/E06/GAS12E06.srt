1
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:06,817
According to this man's
family, he was not a smoker.

2
00:00:06,841 --> 00:00:09,641
But the truth is, he
smoked two packs a day

3
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:11,226
in his car for 20 years

4
00:00:11,295 --> 00:00:13,356
while his wife
and children slept.

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:16,448
Sometimes, the patient's
shame is the elephant in the room.

6
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:18,028
They try to hide it from us.

7
00:00:18,052 --> 00:00:19,462
But you can't hide
from a surgeon,

8
00:00:19,486 --> 00:00:20,963
because the body doesn't lie.

9
00:00:20,987 --> 00:00:23,955
The truth is right here,
for everyone to see.

10
00:00:24,025 --> 00:00:27,408
<i>And it doesn't need
to say a single word.</i>

11
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:34,683
So, uh, DeLuca and I
are basically not talking.

12
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,553
Just like you two.

13
00:00:38,622 --> 00:00:40,188
Only different.

14
00:00:40,256 --> 00:00:41,857
Obviously.

15
00:00:45,713 --> 00:00:49,631
Yeah, I mean, we say "hi,"
but, uh, there's no talking.

16
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:52,885
I mean, even after
the amazing sex.

17
00:00:54,455 --> 00:00:56,521
Once you've had that,

18
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:59,524
you would think it would be
easier to have a conversation.

19
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:08,400
So...

20
00:01:08,469 --> 00:01:11,069
That woman starts today,
the resident from Dillard.

21
00:01:11,138 --> 00:01:13,155
Do you want to talk about that?

22
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,940
'Cause you should.

23
00:01:19,196 --> 00:01:21,079
It doesn't burn
when I pee anymore.

24
00:01:37,213 --> 00:01:38,980
It's your first day.
How... How do you...

25
00:01:39,049 --> 00:01:41,449
It's okay.

26
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:42,962
You don't have to do that.

27
00:01:54,782 --> 00:01:56,081
Hi.

28
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:59,350
Can you guys tell me how to
find out whose service I'm on?

29
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:00,953
I mean, which attending?

30
00:02:01,021 --> 00:02:02,554
You should ask her.

31
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:05,273
I'm probably not
qualified to answer that.

32
00:02:06,176 --> 00:02:08,142
Just check your e-mail.

33
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:11,613
Thank you.

34
00:02:11,682 --> 00:02:13,877
As you know, transfer residents

35
00:02:13,901 --> 00:02:15,545
traditionally do
their first rotation

36
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:17,714
with the Chief of General
Surgery, which is you,

37
00:02:17,738 --> 00:02:20,506
and, as you also know,
our newest transfer,

38
00:02:20,574 --> 00:02:23,842
Penelope Blake,
is starting today.

39
00:02:23,911 --> 00:02:28,029
So, you understand how
this could have happened...

40
00:02:28,098 --> 00:02:29,338
What is "this"?

41
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,866
Dr. Blake is on your service.

42
00:02:31,935 --> 00:02:36,370
However, um, Dr. Webber
has offered to take over.

43
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,623
Or I can. You just say the word.

44
00:02:38,692 --> 00:02:40,258
I'll take Blake.

45
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:41,459
You don't have to.

46
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:43,695
I'm Chief of
General. It's the job.

47
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:45,564
You sure?

48
00:02:45,616 --> 00:02:47,976
Of course. I'll do it.

49
00:02:48,619 --> 00:02:49,634
Uh...

50
00:02:59,446 --> 00:03:01,479
Uh, sir... Sir, you
can't park there.

51
00:03:01,549 --> 00:03:03,509
Oh, no, I'm not parking.
I'm just stopping for a sec.

52
00:03:03,533 --> 00:03:04,777
No, this is for patients only.

53
00:03:04,801 --> 00:03:06,441
Yeah, yeah, I got a
patient. No worries.

54
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:10,655
All righty.

55
00:03:10,724 --> 00:03:12,824
Well, we're a little
late, but we're here.

56
00:03:14,477 --> 00:03:15,710
You ready for this?

57
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:17,212
Yeah.

58
00:03:17,281 --> 00:03:18,691
Did this case a year ago.

59
00:03:18,715 --> 00:03:20,515
Looks amazing. And
we're doing something

60
00:03:20,584 --> 00:03:22,328
like this again today? Yeah.

61
00:03:22,352 --> 00:03:25,598
April's bringing in a kid from
Jordan with Ollier's disease.

62
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:27,622
You can see, these
are the enchondromas.

63
00:03:27,691 --> 00:03:28,931
Cartilaginous tumors.

64
00:03:28,993 --> 00:03:30,136
They grow from the
growth plates, right?

65
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,659
Exactly.

66
00:03:31,728 --> 00:03:33,773
Which is why you're gonna
want to do a wide local excision,

67
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:36,398
expose the bone so I can get in
there and reconstruct the hand.

68
00:03:36,467 --> 00:03:39,233
Wait, wait, wait, wait. I will?

69
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:40,930
I'll dissect the tumors?

70
00:03:40,954 --> 00:03:42,354
I thought so.

71
00:03:42,423 --> 00:03:43,805
If you're up for it.

72
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:45,902
Hell yes, I am.

73
00:03:45,926 --> 00:03:48,126
Are you ready?
They're on their way up.

74
00:03:48,194 --> 00:03:50,475
Uh, why don't you head up
to peds, help him get settled?

75
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:51,771
Yeah.

76
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:57,752
Thank you for doing this.

77
00:03:57,821 --> 00:04:00,489
Listen, it's a great case.
And it's just a resection.

78
00:04:00,557 --> 00:04:02,140
He's such a sweet kid.

79
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:03,775
He's an amazing kid.

80
00:04:03,843 --> 00:04:05,860
He's been through
hell in Jordan,

81
00:04:05,929 --> 00:04:08,262
and he just never gives up.

82
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:10,126
Since he lost his family,
he's been living at the hospital,

83
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,928
and we just give him all
these odd jobs to do and...

84
00:04:11,952 --> 00:04:15,365
April, you can stop selling
him, okay? It's happening.

85
00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:17,429
We are doing it, so...

86
00:04:18,325 --> 00:04:20,759
Good. Just... I just...

87
00:04:20,827 --> 00:04:23,662
Thanks for putting
our stuff aside, and...

88
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:26,130
Let's go see him.

89
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:37,559
Yes.

90
00:04:38,062 --> 00:04:39,528
I am...

91
00:04:39,596 --> 00:04:42,097
I understand I'm on
your service today.

92
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:43,631
That's right.

93
00:04:44,501 --> 00:04:46,079
Dr. Grey, I just want to say,

94
00:04:46,103 --> 00:04:48,820
I don't want today to be
awkward or uncomfortable.

95
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:51,352
So don't make it awkward or
uncomfortable like this, right now.

96
00:04:53,193 --> 00:04:54,888
If there's anything that I...

97
00:04:54,912 --> 00:04:57,012
Consult in the
pit. We're walking.

98
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:05,214
Robert Matthews, 30s, fell
down two flights of stairs.

99
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:06,449
Possible LOC.

100
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:07,817
He's been complaining
of abdominal pain.

101
00:05:07,841 --> 00:05:09,791
I can arrange for a
head CT or page neuro.

102
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:11,926
All I need is an ultrasound.

103
00:05:15,632 --> 00:05:16,793
No! Oh!

104
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:18,316
Whoa, whoa! Calm down. Okay.

105
00:05:18,385 --> 00:05:20,302
No, I... I have to go!

106
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:21,603
Okay.

107
00:05:21,689 --> 00:05:23,538
Relax!

108
00:05:23,607 --> 00:05:26,491
I did something bad,
really bad and I...

109
00:05:27,711 --> 00:05:28,791
Where am I?

110
00:05:28,845 --> 00:05:29,905
How'd I get here?

111
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:31,346
Relax. You fell
down some stairs.

112
00:05:31,415 --> 00:05:33,727
I was trying to get
up to the choir loft.

113
00:05:33,751 --> 00:05:35,016
Choir loft?

114
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:37,313
I'm the pastor at First
Lutheran, and I had...

115
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:38,936
There was an accident.

116
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:40,539
I accidentally...

117
00:05:40,607 --> 00:05:41,923
Oh, God. I have to go!

118
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:43,124
Hey.

119
00:05:43,193 --> 00:05:44,520
Okay, listen, Robert,
you have to calm down,

120
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:46,344
or you're gonna
make this worse, okay?

121
00:05:46,413 --> 00:05:48,029
It's not okay!

122
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:49,364
I sent it to everyone.

123
00:05:49,433 --> 00:05:50,599
Sent what?

124
00:05:50,667 --> 00:05:52,334
The church bulletin.

125
00:05:52,402 --> 00:05:56,304
I went to attach the video of
the youth volleyball game, and...

126
00:05:56,372 --> 00:05:58,651
I've been seeing
someone. A woman.

127
00:05:58,675 --> 00:06:01,860
A nice, but sort of
adventurous woman.

128
00:06:01,929 --> 00:06:03,211
But nice and...

129
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,520
Okay, now you lost me.

130
00:06:05,499 --> 00:06:07,579
I attached the wrong video.

131
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,787
You sent a sex tape?

132
00:06:12,856 --> 00:06:14,951
To my entire congregation.

133
00:06:14,975 --> 00:06:16,891
Oh, good God!

134
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,095
Yeah, can we not talk
about him right now?

135
00:06:20,164 --> 00:06:23,114
I rode on a bus,
a train, a plane,

136
00:06:23,183 --> 00:06:24,743
three cars, and a helicopter.

137
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:26,351
That's amazing!

138
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:29,420
Um, Kamal, I want
you to meet Dr. Avery.

139
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:31,451
He's gonna perform
your operation. Hi.

140
00:06:31,475 --> 00:06:33,441
You are the guy?

141
00:06:34,611 --> 00:06:36,310
"The guy"? Um...

142
00:06:36,379 --> 00:06:38,579
There she is! The machine!

143
00:06:38,649 --> 00:06:40,048
Nathan!

144
00:06:40,117 --> 00:06:41,293
Hey.

145
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:42,917
Oh, man! Hey!

146
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:44,998
Thank you, thank you, thank
you for bringing him here.

147
00:06:45,022 --> 00:06:46,733
Hey, come on. Of course.

148
00:06:46,757 --> 00:06:49,068
Nathan and I worked
together on my last tour.

149
00:06:49,092 --> 00:06:50,758
Dr. Riggs, this is Jackson.

150
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,427
Oh. Dr. Avery.

151
00:06:52,496 --> 00:06:53,794
Yeah, Nathan Riggs. Hey.

152
00:06:53,863 --> 00:06:55,062
Hey. Trauma surgeon?

153
00:06:55,131 --> 00:06:56,793
Cardiothoracic, but over there,

154
00:06:56,817 --> 00:06:58,561
it's pretty much all
trauma, you know?

155
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:00,601
Sure. Sure, yeah.

156
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,920
Dr. Riggs! He is the guy!

157
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:05,306
What is "the guy"?

158
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:06,853
The first time we met Kamal,

159
00:07:06,877 --> 00:07:08,921
Keps said, "I know the
guy who can fix your hands."

160
00:07:08,945 --> 00:07:10,740
So ever since, he's been
talking about meeting "the guy."

161
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:14,015
Well, Kamal, let's
take a look, huh?

162
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:22,908
Oh.

163
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:27,695
Okay. Let's get
this guy up here.

164
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:30,081
All right. Look at this.

165
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,853
Okay.

166
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:40,866
Uh-huh.

167
00:07:43,847 --> 00:07:45,530
You can fix them?

168
00:07:50,003 --> 00:07:51,243
That's the plan.

169
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:56,836
You never told me
it was this advanced.

170
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,571
Those tumors are massive.

171
00:07:58,595 --> 00:07:59,739
Okay, maybe I
downplayed it a little.

172
00:07:59,763 --> 00:08:01,390
You downplayed it?
This looks impossible!

173
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:03,459
I don't understand. You
sent him the scans, right?

174
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,003
Didn't you see the scans?

175
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:08,753
She told me the scans
were lost in Jordan.

176
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:10,049
I didn't want him
to see the scans.

177
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:11,116
Wait. What?

178
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,173
Keps, what the hell?

179
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:13,558
You lied!

180
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:15,221
If you had seen the scans,
you might have said no,

181
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:17,996
and I wanted you
to meet that little boy.

182
00:08:18,064 --> 00:08:19,531
And he's here now.

183
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,881
So how do we help him?

184
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:36,409
Hey. So, Blake's on
Meredith's service?

185
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:37,465
Uh, looks like it.

186
00:08:37,533 --> 00:08:38,777
She gonna be all
right? I don't know.

187
00:08:38,801 --> 00:08:39,946
We haven't spoken
since the party.

188
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:41,314
She feels like I'm
on Meredith's side.

189
00:08:41,338 --> 00:08:42,887
And I am, you know?

190
00:08:42,955 --> 00:08:44,366
But it doesn't mean I'm
not on Penny's side, too.

191
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:46,758
And now Meredith's not
even talking to me, so win-win!

192
00:08:47,961 --> 00:08:49,794
Oh, God.

193
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:51,796
Seventy-eight new messages?

194
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,800
They know.

195
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:57,485
They all know.

196
00:08:59,422 --> 00:09:01,434
What's your assessment?

197
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,418
Well, I think... Not you. Blake.

198
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,772
Ultrasound showed
fluid in Morison's pouch.

199
00:09:05,796 --> 00:09:07,206
We should get an abdominal CT.

200
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:09,190
And what are we
looking for on the CT?

201
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:11,576
We need to rule out bleeding
from the liver or the spleen.

202
00:09:11,618 --> 00:09:13,668
We should also evaluate
the retroperitoneal space.

203
00:09:13,737 --> 00:09:14,948
If there's active
bleeding on the CT,

204
00:09:14,972 --> 00:09:16,487
we set him up for an ex-lap.

205
00:09:16,557 --> 00:09:18,517
Are you forgetting anything?

206
00:09:18,741 --> 00:09:20,308
Uh, we cleared his C-spine,

207
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:22,304
we sent blood out
for a trauma panel,

208
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:24,008
tox screen, alcohol levels.

209
00:09:25,082 --> 00:09:26,314
And?

210
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:30,329
And, uh... Order a
type and crossmatch.

211
00:09:30,353 --> 00:09:31,970
Oh. Of course.

212
00:09:32,022 --> 00:09:33,855
Obviously. I... I skipped that.

213
00:09:33,941 --> 00:09:35,552
Okay, well, let's
not skip steps.

214
00:09:35,576 --> 00:09:37,303
We're a Level I Trauma Center.

215
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:38,838
I need to know what
Dillard taught you.

216
00:09:38,862 --> 00:09:42,046
Let's fill him with fluids
and prep him for a CT.

217
00:09:45,468 --> 00:09:46,901
I didn't lie. I...

218
00:09:46,969 --> 00:09:48,569
You bent the truth a bit.

219
00:09:48,638 --> 00:09:50,104
Until it broke.

220
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:51,950
It was a good lie.

221
00:09:51,974 --> 00:09:53,970
Okay, it was a bad lie,
but for a good reason.

222
00:09:53,994 --> 00:09:55,855
You know, you haven't been
saying yes to anything lately,

223
00:09:55,879 --> 00:09:57,078
not when it comes from me.

224
00:09:57,146 --> 00:09:58,863
Look at the scans, April.

225
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:01,583
Okay, these areas are
pure cartilage, right?

226
00:10:01,651 --> 00:10:02,795
They probably destroyed any bone

227
00:10:02,819 --> 00:10:03,852
that was in their path.

228
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,386
Guys, we don't even know

229
00:10:05,455 --> 00:10:07,133
there's anything resembling
hands underneath these things.

230
00:10:07,157 --> 00:10:09,068
Can you even repair the tendons
and the neurovascular bundles?

231
00:10:09,092 --> 00:10:10,425
That's doubtful.

232
00:10:10,494 --> 00:10:12,121
Well, Hopkins and Case
Western did similar cases.

233
00:10:12,145 --> 00:10:13,723
They reconstructed
using bone grafts.

234
00:10:13,747 --> 00:10:14,924
Oh, so have I, and you know

235
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:16,358
those cases are nothing
compared to Kamal's.

236
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:18,222
April, he's saying no.

237
00:10:18,251 --> 00:10:20,263
Look, we'll just keep
looking until we find someone.

238
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:23,170
And they will all say
the exact same thing.

239
00:10:24,641 --> 00:10:25,773
Thanks.

240
00:10:25,842 --> 00:10:27,725
Thanks for taking the time.

241
00:10:30,397 --> 00:10:32,513
Look, I'm not saying no.

242
00:10:32,582 --> 00:10:35,416
I'm saying I will
do some biopsies

243
00:10:35,485 --> 00:10:37,797
so that we can
all get a full picture

244
00:10:37,821 --> 00:10:40,400
of what it is we're
dealing with here.

245
00:10:40,424 --> 00:10:42,344
Thank you.

246
00:10:45,729 --> 00:10:49,147
I heard there was a
bad driver in the house.

247
00:10:49,216 --> 00:10:50,759
Uncle Richard!

248
00:10:53,936 --> 00:10:56,271
Man, you look bald.

249
00:10:56,356 --> 00:10:58,022
And you look old.

250
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:00,508
"Uncle Richard"?

251
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:03,611
Yeah, Adele and I knew
Paul and his late wife, Lois,

252
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,912
before we got married.

253
00:11:04,981 --> 00:11:07,031
Bumpy and I go way back.

254
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,727
"Bumpy"? Why "Bumpy"?

255
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:10,435
Uh... Hey.

256
00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:12,664
Morning, Angela.

257
00:11:12,688 --> 00:11:13,721
Uh...

258
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:15,551
Tell me about the accident.

259
00:11:15,575 --> 00:11:16,908
How did it happen?

260
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,860
All I know is I
pressed the brake,

261
00:11:18,929 --> 00:11:20,361
but the damn car kept going.

262
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,763
Right into a tree.

263
00:11:22,832 --> 00:11:25,866
Yeah, she's got a severely
displaced clavicular fracture

264
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:28,636
and a weak pulse
in her right arm.

265
00:11:28,705 --> 00:11:30,121
How about Paul?

266
00:11:30,173 --> 00:11:31,984
I'll be fine. Angela
got the worst of it.

267
00:11:32,008 --> 00:11:34,087
Still, I want to work you
up, too, just to be safe.

268
00:11:34,111 --> 00:11:36,160
So I'll go ahead and
schedule that CTA.

269
00:11:36,229 --> 00:11:37,762
That sound good to you, Bumpy?

270
00:11:37,814 --> 00:11:39,697
That'll be quite enough of that.

271
00:11:39,766 --> 00:11:41,015
Sorry.

272
00:11:41,084 --> 00:11:42,583
Dr. Bumpy.

273
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:52,143
Tell me what you see.

274
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:54,012
Retroperitoneal fluid.

275
00:11:54,081 --> 00:11:56,561
Around what? Be specific.

276
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:01,335
The right kidney.

277
00:12:01,404 --> 00:12:04,939
It's a grade IV injury with
an active extravasation.

278
00:12:05,008 --> 00:12:07,759
We are gonna
need to do an ex-lap.

279
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:09,410
Should I call upstairs?

280
00:12:10,347 --> 00:12:11,879
What do we have?

281
00:12:11,965 --> 00:12:15,282
Uh, patient came in with
a head lac, GCS of 14,

282
00:12:15,352 --> 00:12:17,318
loss of consciousness
at the scene...

283
00:12:17,387 --> 00:12:20,049
Can you clear the head CT so
we can take him up for an ex-lap?

284
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:23,074
There's no shift,
contusion, or bleed.

285
00:12:23,142 --> 00:12:24,475
It's a mild concussion.

286
00:12:24,544 --> 00:12:25,560
I'll do a quick exam,

287
00:12:25,628 --> 00:12:27,127
but he's cleared for surgery.

288
00:12:27,196 --> 00:12:29,530
Is this the pastor who
gave his congregation

289
00:12:29,599 --> 00:12:32,217
a, uh, special blessing?

290
00:12:32,285 --> 00:12:33,634
Word travels fast.

291
00:12:33,703 --> 00:12:34,852
All around the hospital.

292
00:12:34,904 --> 00:12:37,555
Yeah, I bet the pews
will be full on Sunday.

293
00:12:42,662 --> 00:12:44,607
Monitor for any neuro deficits.

294
00:12:44,631 --> 00:12:47,098
I will do another
check, post-op.

295
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:48,744
Blake, get him
ready for transport.

296
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:51,049
Edwards, show her where it is.

297
00:13:02,315 --> 00:13:04,844
It's not enough to have her
here in the same building.

298
00:13:04,868 --> 00:13:06,846
You invited her on
your service, too?

299
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,970
I am trying to rise above.

300
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,704
And you should, too.

301
00:13:10,773 --> 00:13:13,458
No, you should have
ended it that night.

302
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:18,329
Forget it.

303
00:13:18,398 --> 00:13:20,165
It was better when
we weren't talking.

304
00:13:25,238 --> 00:13:27,165
As I feared, the biopsy showed

305
00:13:27,189 --> 00:13:28,984
precancerous cells in the tumor.

306
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:30,036
Both sides.

307
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:33,160
Okay. Then we need
to get in there ASAP...

308
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:36,464
April, listen, there is no clear
way to excise all the tumor.

309
00:13:36,533 --> 00:13:40,134
So I have to
recommend amputation.

310
00:13:40,203 --> 00:13:41,902
Of both hands.

311
00:13:41,971 --> 00:13:43,754
No.

312
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:45,251
It is his best shot before
it progresses to cancer.

313
00:13:45,275 --> 00:13:47,758
No. I brought him to
you to save his hands.

314
00:13:47,828 --> 00:13:49,471
This is how we save his life.

315
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:50,928
Well, I don't know.

316
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:52,541
I don't see how he
survives over there

317
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:54,310
with no hands and no
one to take care of him.

318
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:56,112
I understand. I'm sorry.

319
00:13:56,136 --> 00:13:58,030
I could have told you sooner
if I had all the information.

320
00:13:58,054 --> 00:13:59,364
You mean you could
have given up sooner.

321
00:13:59,388 --> 00:14:01,433
Yes, you're right, because
there's nothing to be done.

322
00:14:01,457 --> 00:14:02,556
You could try!

323
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:03,774
You could make an effort

324
00:14:03,826 --> 00:14:05,693
instead of just giving
up and walking away!

325
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:07,106
And you don't think I want to?

326
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:08,624
All right, we're not doing this.

327
00:14:08,648 --> 00:14:10,293
Could you leave us
alone for a second, please?

328
00:14:10,317 --> 00:14:11,760
Oh, absolutely, I'm gonna leave,

329
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:13,446
and I'm gonna take
Kamal with me, all right?

330
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:15,753
'Cause this isn't
about you two! Okay?

331
00:14:15,805 --> 00:14:18,840
This is about a little boy who
had to see his family murdered,

332
00:14:18,908 --> 00:14:20,386
who saw his home
burned to the ground,

333
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:22,071
who would've been
taken as a child soldier

334
00:14:22,095 --> 00:14:24,362
if it wasn't for his
deformed hands.

335
00:14:24,431 --> 00:14:25,741
All right, he doesn't
have the time

336
00:14:25,765 --> 00:14:27,999
for you guys to be
working out your crap!

337
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:29,645
He deserves the
best care he can get,

338
00:14:29,669 --> 00:14:31,629
and I'm gonna
make sure he finds it.

339
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:35,451
Why'd you even bring him to me?

340
00:14:35,475 --> 00:14:37,470
You saw the scans.
You're a good surgeon.

341
00:14:37,494 --> 00:14:38,671
You knew this was hopeless.

342
00:14:38,695 --> 00:14:40,194
I wasn't hopeless.

343
00:14:40,262 --> 00:14:42,129
I don't know why you are.

344
00:14:42,198 --> 00:14:44,899
Because there's
nothing here to save.

345
00:14:53,776 --> 00:14:57,211
What's the trickiest part
of a partial nephrectomy?

346
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,357
Well, I think it's
essential that...

347
00:14:58,381 --> 00:14:59,847
Not you. Blake.

348
00:14:59,915 --> 00:15:02,778
Mobilizing the colon quickly to get
adequate exposure of the kidney.

349
00:15:02,802 --> 00:15:04,051
By your third year,

350
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,248
you should know this
surgery inside and out.

351
00:15:05,272 --> 00:15:06,482
I do. Okay.

352
00:15:06,506 --> 00:15:08,255
So you are gonna
walk me through this.

353
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:09,484
Your hands are my hands,

354
00:15:09,508 --> 00:15:11,208
and my hands do not
like making mistakes.

355
00:15:11,277 --> 00:15:12,443
Are you ready?

356
00:15:12,512 --> 00:15:13,990
I am. Yes, I'm ready.

357
00:15:14,014 --> 00:15:15,625
With what? Because I
have nothing in my hands.

358
00:15:15,649 --> 00:15:16,889
Right. Uh, 10 blade.

359
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:18,249
10 blade.

360
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:22,553
CTA results showed an injury

361
00:15:22,621 --> 00:15:24,488
to an artery in Angela's chest.

362
00:15:24,557 --> 00:15:26,340
She's on her way to pre-op now.

363
00:15:26,409 --> 00:15:28,976
She doesn't want you
to worry, and neither do I.

364
00:15:29,045 --> 00:15:30,940
You sound just like Bumpy.

365
00:15:30,964 --> 00:15:34,065
You have to tell me why
you call him "Bumpy."

366
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:36,400
Well, that's 'cause,

367
00:15:36,469 --> 00:15:38,297
back in the day, when
we were in college...

368
00:15:38,321 --> 00:15:40,871
Got your results back.

369
00:15:40,923 --> 00:15:42,322
Oh, you hurt your foot?

370
00:15:42,392 --> 00:15:43,469
No, no, it's fine.

371
00:15:43,493 --> 00:15:45,959
It's pins and needles, is all.

372
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:48,328
It's... It's, uh... It's
just a little numb.

373
00:15:48,398 --> 00:15:49,638
It'll go away.

374
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:53,267
I don't think it
will, not by itself.

375
00:15:53,336 --> 00:15:56,521
Your labs show elevated
hemoglobin A1c levels.

376
00:15:56,589 --> 00:15:58,901
And your blood glucose
level is very high.

377
00:15:58,925 --> 00:16:00,691
You're diabetic.

378
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,471
But you already knew that.

379
00:16:02,495 --> 00:16:05,863
Listen, Bumpy, I've been
taking better care of myself.

380
00:16:05,932 --> 00:16:08,060
Angela doesn't know, and...
And I want us to keep it that way.

381
00:16:08,084 --> 00:16:09,645
That pain in your foot?

382
00:16:09,669 --> 00:16:11,118
It's a symptom, Paul.

383
00:16:11,204 --> 00:16:13,537
It's called diabetic nerve pain.

384
00:16:13,606 --> 00:16:16,046
It could be the reason
you crashed your car.

385
00:16:17,277 --> 00:16:19,409
Are you saying I put
my baby in the hospital?

386
00:16:19,462 --> 00:16:21,529
No. It was an accident.

387
00:16:21,597 --> 00:16:23,292
She loves you.
She'll understand.

388
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:24,765
Just tell her...

389
00:16:24,834 --> 00:16:26,234
Do you have any
children, Richard?

390
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,204
Do you?

391
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:33,398
No. No, I don't.

392
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:34,753
So you don't know a damn thing.

393
00:16:34,777 --> 00:16:36,543
You can't possibly understand.

394
00:16:36,613 --> 00:16:39,208
Please, just... Just
take care of my little girl,

395
00:16:39,232 --> 00:16:40,898
and leave me be.

396
00:16:40,967 --> 00:16:44,168
I'll let you know as soon
as Angela's out of surgery.

397
00:16:54,113 --> 00:16:56,074
And now Jackson
wants to amputate.

398
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:58,632
He won't even try. He
said it was hopeless.

399
00:16:58,701 --> 00:17:01,780
He... He asked me why I
even brought Kamal to him.

400
00:17:01,804 --> 00:17:03,671
What?

401
00:17:03,739 --> 00:17:05,739
Well? Why did you?

402
00:17:05,808 --> 00:17:07,074
I mean, the scans were so bad,

403
00:17:07,143 --> 00:17:08,458
you had to lie about them.

404
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:11,479
You lied about
a little boy, April.

405
00:17:11,564 --> 00:17:13,964
I'm... What... What
are you saying?

406
00:17:16,403 --> 00:17:18,085
Nothing. I'm sorry.

407
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:23,357
I'm saying, I
know what it's like

408
00:17:23,426 --> 00:17:25,259
when it feels like
everything's coming apart

409
00:17:25,328 --> 00:17:28,395
and you need something
to pull it together.

410
00:17:30,032 --> 00:17:31,298
I just...

411
00:17:32,769 --> 00:17:34,001
I know.

412
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:40,240
Are you sure?

413
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:43,210
Well, maybe you can
show them to Rogers.

414
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:45,179
Yeah, I'd appreciate it.

415
00:17:45,247 --> 00:17:47,981
All right, call me
back. Thanks, Charlie.

416
00:17:49,585 --> 00:17:50,751
Riggs?

417
00:17:55,358 --> 00:17:56,490
Hunt.

418
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:58,409
What are you doing here?

419
00:17:58,478 --> 00:18:00,088
April Kepner and
I met in Jordan.

420
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:01,891
I've been working with the
relief effort in Afghanistan.

421
00:18:01,915 --> 00:18:04,665
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
What are you doing here?

422
00:18:04,733 --> 00:18:06,278
We have a patient
with Ollier's disease.

423
00:18:06,302 --> 00:18:07,663
Brought him in to your hand guy.

424
00:18:07,687 --> 00:18:08,936
And then you're leaving.

425
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:10,349
Yeah, well, maybe
a little sooner than I...

426
00:18:10,373 --> 00:18:13,007
I'm not asking you,
Riggs. I'm telling you.

427
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:17,477
Nice catching up.

428
00:18:19,081 --> 00:18:20,447
Incise Gerota's fascia.

429
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:22,816
Now identify and
debride devitalized tissue.

430
00:18:22,885 --> 00:18:23,984
Go on.

431
00:18:24,721 --> 00:18:25,853
Um...

432
00:18:25,922 --> 00:18:27,365
Cauterize cortical bleeders

433
00:18:27,389 --> 00:18:29,674
and establish
hemostasis before closure.

434
00:18:29,742 --> 00:18:31,987
Now close using a
running absorbable suture

435
00:18:32,011 --> 00:18:33,444
to avoid post-op fistulas.

436
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:35,947
You can even reinforce
using an absorbable mesh.

437
00:18:36,015 --> 00:18:38,665
Well, that's thinking
ahead. I like that.

438
00:18:38,734 --> 00:18:40,084
Dr. Grey. Dr. Blake.

439
00:18:40,152 --> 00:18:42,770
I thought I'd stop in to see
how the first day was going.

440
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:45,000
Thank you, sir. It's been...

441
00:18:45,024 --> 00:18:47,174
Blake has been dictating
my surgical steps.

442
00:18:47,243 --> 00:18:49,454
Great. How's she
doing? Not too well.

443
00:18:49,478 --> 00:18:51,156
If I had done what
she just suggested,

444
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:54,348
the patient would have
major renal cortex bleeding.

445
00:18:54,417 --> 00:18:55,716
What did you miss?

446
00:18:55,785 --> 00:18:57,718
I... What?

447
00:18:57,787 --> 00:19:01,054
What did I do that you missed?

448
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:03,424
Uh, debride,
hemostasis, close...

449
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:05,225
Come on. Figure it out.

450
00:19:05,294 --> 00:19:07,628
I was watching
you. I didn't see.

451
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:09,930
DeLuca, can you
fill in the blanks?

452
00:19:09,998 --> 00:19:13,584
Um, Dr. Blake didn't tell
you to clamp the hilum.

453
00:19:13,636 --> 00:19:15,352
Dr. Grey, the hilum is clamped.

454
00:19:15,421 --> 00:19:18,039
It is, sir, because I
clamped it on my own.

455
00:19:18,107 --> 00:19:20,240
I didn't skip a
step, and therefore,

456
00:19:20,309 --> 00:19:22,143
the patient did not
hemorrhage and die.

457
00:19:22,228 --> 00:19:24,294
Blake, hand your
suction to DeLuca.

458
00:19:24,364 --> 00:19:26,397
Dr. Grey, I know this procedure.

459
00:19:26,449 --> 00:19:28,215
You would've killed
the patient, Blake.

460
00:19:28,284 --> 00:19:30,801
If your hands had been
my hands on this patient,

461
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:31,968
he'd be dead.

462
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:33,037
It's that simple.

463
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:34,221
Step away from the table.

464
00:19:58,364 --> 00:19:59,563
What's wrong?

465
00:19:59,632 --> 00:20:01,265
Dr. Grey is what's wrong.

466
00:20:02,318 --> 00:20:03,383
I'm new.

467
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:05,269
And attendings are
hard on residents.

468
00:20:05,338 --> 00:20:06,904
I know that. It's how we learn.

469
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:09,840
And she should be hard on
me. She should be grilling me.

470
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:12,510
And I should be
able to handle it.

471
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:15,579
But I let her in
my head. I froze.

472
00:20:15,648 --> 00:20:18,449
I knew that surgery
backwards and forwards.

473
00:20:18,518 --> 00:20:19,833
Hey, I can talk to her.

474
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:21,952
No. Don't.

475
00:20:22,021 --> 00:20:24,154
I'm sorry. I just...

476
00:20:24,224 --> 00:20:26,624
I will figure this out.

477
00:20:26,693 --> 00:20:28,508
It's not your problem.

478
00:20:38,554 --> 00:20:41,939
I sent the biopsies, the
scans to three other guys.

479
00:20:42,008 --> 00:20:43,473
Any luck?

480
00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:44,542
No.

481
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:46,891
Well, I'd like to
have been wrong.

482
00:20:48,798 --> 00:20:51,209
Hey, look, I'm sorry you
got pulled into this, man.

483
00:20:51,233 --> 00:20:52,277
April can be...

484
00:20:52,301 --> 00:20:54,101
No, look, I know.

485
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:55,519
She's the machine.

486
00:20:56,355 --> 00:20:58,038
She's the what?

487
00:20:58,124 --> 00:21:00,992
Oh, that's what we call her
over there, "The machine."

488
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:03,226
It never slows down,
never lets it get to her.

489
00:21:03,295 --> 00:21:06,313
Just makes everyone
else want to work harder.

490
00:21:06,382 --> 00:21:09,517
When she decides on something,
nothing's gonna stop her.

491
00:21:09,585 --> 00:21:12,452
You can't call that one off.

492
00:21:12,522 --> 00:21:14,622
No, that's true.

493
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,507
Thing is, she's usually right.

494
00:21:25,384 --> 00:21:28,145
Go find out what Callie
Torres is doing right now.

495
00:21:35,578 --> 00:21:37,789
Oh. Angela's surgery is over?

496
00:21:37,813 --> 00:21:39,424
How... How'd it go?

497
00:21:39,448 --> 00:21:41,615
Did a primary repair
of the subclavian artery.

498
00:21:41,684 --> 00:21:42,816
It went very well.

499
00:21:42,885 --> 00:21:44,262
You can tell your
friend she's fine.

500
00:21:44,286 --> 00:21:47,087
Maggie, uh, about Paul.

501
00:21:47,173 --> 00:21:49,973
You know, what he said
about my not having children...

502
00:21:50,009 --> 00:21:51,654
Paul knew me with
Adele, my wife...

503
00:21:51,678 --> 00:21:54,611
I know. I know. It's...
It's awkward. Awful.

504
00:21:54,681 --> 00:21:56,730
No, you don't have to
say another word. I get it.

505
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:57,898
Okay.

506
00:21:57,967 --> 00:21:59,061
I just wanted to make sure...

507
00:21:59,085 --> 00:22:00,334
Don't

508
00:22:01,104 --> 00:22:03,137
say another word.

509
00:22:05,174 --> 00:22:06,568
Are you... No.

510
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:07,752
No, no. Of course not.

511
00:22:07,776 --> 00:22:08,921
This is, um...
This is allergies.

512
00:22:08,945 --> 00:22:10,328
Allergies?

513
00:22:10,396 --> 00:22:12,174
Can we please pretend
that it's allergies?

514
00:22:12,198 --> 00:22:13,876
Maggie, if I did something...

515
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,198
No, no. God, no.

516
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:17,184
You... You cheated on your wife.

517
00:22:17,253 --> 00:22:19,253
Why should you admit
that to your friend?

518
00:22:20,522 --> 00:22:22,222
Who would that help?

519
00:22:22,291 --> 00:22:24,858
Not you, not him.

520
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:26,571
And, you know, you
don't owe me anything.

521
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:28,245
You and I, we're not...

522
00:22:28,313 --> 00:22:29,947
I don't know what we are.

523
00:22:30,016 --> 00:22:31,281
That's just the thing.

524
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,395
I don't exactly know
how to address you...

525
00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:34,863
Yeah, you don't have to. But...

526
00:22:34,887 --> 00:22:36,553
It's fine.

527
00:22:36,622 --> 00:22:39,289
You have nothing to
be ashamed of. Really.

528
00:22:39,726 --> 00:22:40,891
But...

529
00:22:44,614 --> 00:22:47,593
So, they would just be gone?

530
00:22:47,617 --> 00:22:49,150
Both of them?

531
00:22:50,753 --> 00:22:52,586
We would have to amputate them

532
00:22:52,655 --> 00:22:55,839
right about here, at the wrist.

533
00:22:55,908 --> 00:22:57,274
You see?

534
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:00,027
On both sides.

535
00:23:02,314 --> 00:23:04,595
Will I still carry things?

536
00:23:05,834 --> 00:23:07,334
Well, let's talk
about that, buddy.

537
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:16,354
You'll be here when I'm done?

538
00:23:16,378 --> 00:23:18,745
Yes. I promise.

539
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:20,580
You sure about this?

540
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:22,716
Nope. Not even a little bit.

541
00:23:22,784 --> 00:23:24,918
We'll have a soda
waiting for you, okay?

542
00:23:28,941 --> 00:23:31,508
Okay.

543
00:23:33,812 --> 00:23:34,978
God.

544
00:23:36,115 --> 00:23:37,926
All right, guys,
how we doing this?

545
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:39,049
Doing what?

546
00:23:39,118 --> 00:23:40,429
I figure we'll just
debulk the tumor

547
00:23:40,453 --> 00:23:42,046
from the dorsal surface,
and you can show me

548
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:44,204
what, if any, usable
bone we can find.

549
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:45,756
There's been a change of plans.

550
00:23:45,825 --> 00:23:47,385
Yeah, judging by the scans,

551
00:23:47,409 --> 00:23:49,354
I'm not sure there's
anything at all. I know.

552
00:23:49,378 --> 00:23:51,656
It just might end up being
the world's slowest amputation,

553
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,081
but can't hurt to try. Mmm-hmm.

554
00:23:57,403 --> 00:23:59,503
But you told Kamal
that he wouldn't...

555
00:23:59,572 --> 00:24:02,289
We lied.

556
00:24:02,358 --> 00:24:04,819
We had to. Didn't want
to get his hopes up again.

557
00:24:04,843 --> 00:24:06,860
He's gonna try? Mmm-hmm.

558
00:24:09,165 --> 00:24:10,931
You lied! To me!

559
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:12,994
It was a good lie. Come
on. It was a good lie.

560
00:24:14,603 --> 00:24:16,637
Oh, my God.

561
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,307
He's gonna try.

562
00:24:23,312 --> 00:24:24,778
We need to talk.

563
00:24:24,846 --> 00:24:26,213
What's wrong?

564
00:24:26,282 --> 00:24:27,492
I thought you were stepping up,

565
00:24:27,516 --> 00:24:28,810
putting Blake on your service,

566
00:24:28,834 --> 00:24:31,435
but what I saw in that
OR wasn't teaching.

567
00:24:31,504 --> 00:24:33,615
She crapped out on a
basic surgical principle.

568
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:35,205
You were hazing her.

569
00:24:35,258 --> 00:24:38,353
If she cracks under the
pressure of an emergent surgery,

570
00:24:38,377 --> 00:24:40,489
she does not belong
in this program.

571
00:24:40,513 --> 00:24:42,579
Blake was at the top
of her class at Dillard.

572
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:45,849
Her references were
impeccable. I checked them myself.

573
00:24:47,052 --> 00:24:48,852
You checked?

574
00:24:48,905 --> 00:24:51,571
So you knew where she was from?

575
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,974
You checked her case record?

576
00:24:54,042 --> 00:24:55,575
Her losses?

577
00:24:58,397 --> 00:24:59,713
Did you know that she...

578
00:24:59,782 --> 00:25:01,548
She was an excellent candidate.

579
00:25:01,617 --> 00:25:04,568
You were the only
reason not to hire her.

580
00:25:06,155 --> 00:25:08,956
And you didn't find
that reason enough?

581
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:23,470
Your labs are
within normal limits.

582
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:26,706
That's good news.

583
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:28,976
I'm on every website.

584
00:25:29,044 --> 00:25:30,989
Got an e-mail from our bishop.

585
00:25:31,013 --> 00:25:33,480
I'm fired.

586
00:25:33,548 --> 00:25:34,926
Someone's threatening
to bring me up

587
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:37,150
on charges as a sexual predator.

588
00:25:38,454 --> 00:25:39,853
I'm done.

589
00:25:41,156 --> 00:25:43,001
We're supposed
to be a community.

590
00:25:43,025 --> 00:25:45,859
I make one simple mistake,
and they destroyed me.

591
00:25:45,927 --> 00:25:47,361
Put it away.

592
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:50,530
My mother saw it.

593
00:25:50,599 --> 00:25:54,034
Her friends won't talk to her.

594
00:25:54,103 --> 00:25:56,381
Everybody's trying to
figure out who the woman is,

595
00:25:56,405 --> 00:25:58,485
as if it's any of
their business.

596
00:25:58,624 --> 00:26:01,458
Thank the Lord, she's okay.

597
00:26:01,527 --> 00:26:03,967
At least her life
isn't over, too.

598
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:05,979
Nothing is over.

599
00:26:06,048 --> 00:26:08,716
It's different for
us, the clergy.

600
00:26:10,018 --> 00:26:13,286
People put their
trust in us, their faith.

601
00:26:15,157 --> 00:26:18,041
We break that
trust, it stays broken.

602
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:19,710
I can't believe that.

603
00:26:20,946 --> 00:26:23,230
You know who you are.

604
00:26:23,298 --> 00:26:25,532
You can stand up to
them and have faith in that,

605
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,517
have faith in yourself.

606
00:26:29,238 --> 00:26:31,521
I have to believe that.

607
00:26:31,591 --> 00:26:34,102
They say he doesn't give
you more than you can handle.

608
00:26:34,126 --> 00:26:37,711
You say that, actually.

609
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:39,896
Yes, I do.

610
00:26:42,251 --> 00:26:44,362
Ow.

611
00:26:44,386 --> 00:26:45,452
Are you okay?

612
00:26:45,521 --> 00:26:47,020
My stomach.

613
00:26:55,865 --> 00:26:57,785
Nurse! Coming!

614
00:26:59,084 --> 00:27:00,404
There is a clot in his catheter.

615
00:27:00,435 --> 00:27:01,763
His bladder's about to rupture.

616
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:03,687
I need a syringe with
some saline and heparin,

617
00:27:03,739 --> 00:27:05,105
and page Dr. Grey, now!

618
00:27:05,173 --> 00:27:06,539
Right away.

619
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:10,644
You're okay.

620
00:27:10,713 --> 00:27:13,146
Those nerves are
going everywhere.

621
00:27:13,215 --> 00:27:15,549
How do you build
something from that?

622
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,370
Well, for what it's worth,

623
00:27:20,439 --> 00:27:21,905
I think you were
right about him.

624
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:23,823
He's good.

625
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:26,043
I know.

626
00:27:26,111 --> 00:27:29,046
He's talking about divorce.

627
00:27:29,115 --> 00:27:31,849
Well, you kind of saw
that coming, though, right?

628
00:27:31,917 --> 00:27:34,051
I mean, he said,
"Don't go." You went.

629
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,436
On some level...

630
00:27:35,521 --> 00:27:38,055
It's not gonna happen.
It's not what I want.

631
00:27:38,124 --> 00:27:40,890
I don't believe
it's what he wants.

632
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:43,977
I know it's not what
God wants from me.

633
00:27:45,948 --> 00:27:48,532
We're looking at a kid
who's lost his family,

634
00:27:49,368 --> 00:27:50,801
his home.

635
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:53,837
Might even lose his hands now.

636
00:27:53,906 --> 00:27:55,739
Maybe God has more on his mind

637
00:27:55,807 --> 00:27:58,808
than judging whether
you get a divorce or not.

638
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:02,479
Don't you think he
has bigger fish to fry?

639
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:07,624
I've got about 60% of
bone structure over here.

640
00:28:07,653 --> 00:28:09,197
How's it going over there?

641
00:28:09,221 --> 00:28:12,723
I only see free-floating
distal phalanges,

642
00:28:12,792 --> 00:28:15,592
and some of them
are eroded by tumor.

643
00:28:15,661 --> 00:28:18,495
We're approaching the
carpals or what's left of them.

644
00:28:18,564 --> 00:28:20,592
I'm looking for
metacarpals over here.

645
00:28:20,616 --> 00:28:22,527
Do you see any
viable bone at all?

646
00:28:22,551 --> 00:28:24,351
Well... No.

647
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:26,114
Damn it! JACKSON:
What? What is it? Tell me.

648
00:28:26,138 --> 00:28:29,406
Jackson, I'm sorry. I'm just...

649
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:30,857
There's nothing here. I...

650
00:28:30,926 --> 00:28:33,038
No, no, no. Wait.
Just wait one second.

651
00:28:33,062 --> 00:28:34,711
Well, no. There's
no bone to work with.

652
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:36,663
I mean, look at
it. Look right here.

653
00:28:36,731 --> 00:28:38,393
There's fingers, and
then there's nothing.

654
00:28:38,417 --> 00:28:40,128
I don't... Come on. Come on.

655
00:28:40,152 --> 00:28:41,946
Jackson, I think...
Just wait, okay?

656
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:43,737
I think that you were right.

657
00:28:43,806 --> 00:28:46,055
I don't want to be
right, though. I just...

658
00:28:46,124 --> 00:28:47,824
Let's keep going, please, okay?

659
00:28:47,893 --> 00:28:49,426
Yeah, of course.

660
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,396
Put that down!

661
00:28:53,465 --> 00:28:55,265
We are working here!

662
00:28:55,334 --> 00:28:56,974
We're gonna keep
going until we are sure

663
00:28:57,036 --> 00:28:58,418
that there is nothing left.

664
00:28:58,487 --> 00:29:00,607
Now, do not pick that up
again unless I tell you to.

665
00:29:03,675 --> 00:29:05,470
Jackson? I'm
sorry. I was just...

666
00:29:05,494 --> 00:29:07,506
No, no, no, Jackson,
look right here. Look.

667
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:09,474
I found something.
I found lunate bone.

668
00:29:09,498 --> 00:29:11,665
This is good lunate bone.

669
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:15,285
What happened?

670
00:29:15,354 --> 00:29:16,781
I think he clotted his Foley.

671
00:29:16,805 --> 00:29:20,124
I've flushed it five times.
I can't get a new one in.

672
00:29:20,976 --> 00:29:22,942
He's hypotensive.

673
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:25,812
Get me a 50 cc with
a 14-gauge needle.

674
00:29:25,881 --> 00:29:27,414
You got it. How did this happen?

675
00:29:27,483 --> 00:29:28,848
I was doing a post-op check,

676
00:29:28,917 --> 00:29:30,850
and I saw that there
was blood in his bag.

677
00:29:30,919 --> 00:29:32,847
How long did it take
for you to notice?

678
00:29:32,871 --> 00:29:34,370
I don't... Uh, we
were talking...

679
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,217
You realize if he
goes into renal failure,

680
00:29:36,241 --> 00:29:38,286
this will undo everything
we did in the OR today.

681
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:40,227
Dr. Grey, I didn't
miss this. I caught it.

682
00:29:40,296 --> 00:29:42,156
It shouldn't have happened!

683
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:44,459
You froze in the OR, you
screwed up his post-op care!

684
00:29:44,483 --> 00:29:48,218
Is there any part of this job
that you can handle, Blake?

685
00:29:48,854 --> 00:29:49,987
I...

686
00:29:52,341 --> 00:29:53,952
Get out. You're not
touching this patient.

687
00:29:53,976 --> 00:29:55,842
You're off my service.

688
00:29:55,911 --> 00:29:57,151
Get out!

689
00:29:57,496 --> 00:29:58,736
Now!

690
00:30:02,184 --> 00:30:04,701
All right. The
hamate bone's intact.

691
00:30:05,888 --> 00:30:07,871
<i>There's the trapezoid.</i>

692
00:30:08,924 --> 00:30:10,356
<i>And...</i>

693
00:30:10,426 --> 00:30:11,666
There's the scaphoid.

694
00:30:11,727 --> 00:30:13,760
That makes four
good carpal bones.

695
00:30:13,828 --> 00:30:15,094
Which is not much.

696
00:30:15,163 --> 00:30:16,829
And almost no metacarpal.

697
00:30:16,899 --> 00:30:19,332
But we'd have a base
for a proximal phalanx,

698
00:30:19,401 --> 00:30:20,500
so that might regenerate.

699
00:30:20,568 --> 00:30:21,968
He is young, so...

700
00:30:22,037 --> 00:30:25,088
Maybe we could sculpt the bone
and graft the gap in between?

701
00:30:25,157 --> 00:30:26,951
We could wire
them with rib grafts.

702
00:30:26,975 --> 00:30:29,409
I mean, then I could actually
make something out of that.

703
00:30:29,478 --> 00:30:33,113
Yes! Look! Look! That's
a fifth metacarpal head!

704
00:30:33,181 --> 00:30:35,081
Look! Right there!

705
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:36,361
That's a hand. That
is what we needed.

706
00:30:36,385 --> 00:30:38,396
Under there, that's...
That is a hand!

707
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,048
We got a hand, people!

708
00:30:49,398 --> 00:30:50,730
Whew!

709
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:52,465
Oh, my God!

710
00:30:53,468 --> 00:30:55,435
Whew!

711
00:30:55,521 --> 00:30:57,453
I can't friggin' believe it.

712
00:30:58,156 --> 00:30:59,355
I did.

713
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:06,846
She is going to be fine.

714
00:31:13,588 --> 00:31:15,449
And you should talk to her.

715
00:31:15,473 --> 00:31:18,052
I don't even know if I can
look her in the eye now,

716
00:31:18,076 --> 00:31:19,992
let alone talk to her.

717
00:31:24,633 --> 00:31:26,933
Thirty years ago,
I had an affair.

718
00:31:28,604 --> 00:31:30,503
I cheated on Adele.

719
00:31:30,572 --> 00:31:31,955
And I had a daughter.

720
00:31:32,024 --> 00:31:34,124
I have a daughter.

721
00:31:35,377 --> 00:31:38,573
Adele never told Lois or
anyone about the affair.

722
00:31:38,597 --> 00:31:41,615
She never bashed
me to her family.

723
00:31:41,684 --> 00:31:46,787
She lived with that pain and
embarrassment for years, alone.

724
00:31:46,855 --> 00:31:50,189
She protected me,
and I'm ashamed of that.

725
00:31:51,092 --> 00:31:52,342
It was a mess.

726
00:31:53,012 --> 00:31:55,328
I made a mess.

727
00:31:55,397 --> 00:31:58,664
And for as much pain
as I caused and felt,

728
00:31:58,733 --> 00:32:00,762
I would have never believed

729
00:32:00,786 --> 00:32:03,067
that nything good
would have come of it.

730
00:32:03,255 --> 00:32:04,621
But it did.

731
00:32:05,557 --> 00:32:06,957
She did.

732
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:12,245
And I am very proud to know her.

733
00:32:26,979 --> 00:32:28,878
You were right. She
doesn't belong here.

734
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:30,363
She almost killed a patient.

735
00:32:30,449 --> 00:32:32,816
She can't be trusted, not
in the OR, not with patients.

736
00:32:32,884 --> 00:32:34,851
She's just dangerous.

737
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:39,990
Say it again.

738
00:32:40,059 --> 00:32:41,224
What?

739
00:32:42,727 --> 00:32:44,294
I was right.

740
00:32:44,363 --> 00:32:48,048
I tried to rise above because
it's the right thing to do.

741
00:32:49,685 --> 00:32:52,702
But she has made
mistake after mistake,

742
00:32:52,755 --> 00:32:55,722
and she just is impossible.

743
00:33:04,132 --> 00:33:06,600
I'm sorry. It's the truth.

744
00:33:06,685 --> 00:33:10,053
She is working at a hospital
that is above her skill level.

745
00:33:10,105 --> 00:33:12,105
I have tried to
teach her all day.

746
00:33:12,173 --> 00:33:13,473
I have tried.

747
00:33:13,542 --> 00:33:15,625
Oh, please. You're
being a bully.

748
00:33:15,694 --> 00:33:17,238
And you've gone out of
your way to make her...

749
00:33:17,262 --> 00:33:19,457
You don't teach by shoving
someone else's face in the dirt.

750
00:33:19,481 --> 00:33:20,513
That's not teaching.

751
00:33:20,582 --> 00:33:23,617
That's just being
mean and small.

752
00:33:47,392 --> 00:33:48,725
Leave me alone.

753
00:33:50,462 --> 00:33:51,578
Since when do you pray?

754
00:33:51,647 --> 00:33:53,196
I'm not.

755
00:33:53,264 --> 00:33:55,565
Or talk to God or whatever.

756
00:33:55,633 --> 00:33:57,679
I'm not talking to God.

757
00:33:57,703 --> 00:33:59,652
Well, you talk to tequila.

758
00:33:59,738 --> 00:34:01,721
I'm talking to Derek.

759
00:34:02,591 --> 00:34:03,607
Oh.

760
00:34:04,442 --> 00:34:05,875
Okay, I'll go.

761
00:34:05,944 --> 00:34:07,777
I'm trying.

762
00:34:07,845 --> 00:34:11,514
I've tried to rise, I've
tried to teach her, but I just

763
00:34:11,583 --> 00:34:14,718
don't think I can.

764
00:34:16,722 --> 00:34:18,237
I thought he might know

765
00:34:19,908 --> 00:34:22,409
what I'm supposed
to do with her,

766
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:25,244
why she's here.

767
00:34:25,314 --> 00:34:27,664
I thought maybe
he could tell me.

768
00:34:28,834 --> 00:34:31,074
So, I'm just gonna sit here and

769
00:34:32,304 --> 00:34:35,671
wait for some divine
intervention or whatever.

770
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:12,092
They look like hands.

771
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,325
They are.

772
00:35:14,646 --> 00:35:16,395
They're your hands, bud.

773
00:35:18,884 --> 00:35:20,678
- They're real hands!
- Yeah!

774
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,773
I can hold a ball.

775
00:35:26,842 --> 00:35:28,325
Yeah.

776
00:35:28,393 --> 00:35:32,161
Take a little bit of time, a
few more surgeries, but yes.

777
00:35:32,214 --> 00:35:34,814
What did we tell
you? He's the guy.

778
00:35:36,935 --> 00:35:38,985
You are the guy.

779
00:35:39,054 --> 00:35:41,353
Oh! Ah.

780
00:35:54,786 --> 00:35:57,026
He never did tell me
why they call you "Bumpy."

781
00:36:00,492 --> 00:36:04,294
There was a dance called
the bump, before your time,

782
00:36:04,363 --> 00:36:05,995
and I excelled at it.

783
00:36:10,285 --> 00:36:12,405
You didn't tell him it was me.

784
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:15,466
Well, I feel, if you
want to tell people,

785
00:36:15,490 --> 00:36:17,306
that's your decision, not mine.

786
00:36:17,376 --> 00:36:20,593
I'm sorry. I'm still
trying to figure this out.

787
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:21,978
Okay.

788
00:36:22,047 --> 00:36:24,714
But for the record,

789
00:36:24,782 --> 00:36:27,384
I'd be fine with it if you did.

790
00:36:27,452 --> 00:36:28,851
Very fine.

791
00:36:31,023 --> 00:36:32,255
Noted.

792
00:36:47,004 --> 00:36:48,170
Yeah.

793
00:36:50,191 --> 00:36:51,357
April.

794
00:36:53,995 --> 00:36:57,897
I, uh... I never said
thanks for bringing Kamal.

795
00:36:57,965 --> 00:37:00,316
I'm so sorry for lying, but...

796
00:37:00,385 --> 00:37:03,319
God, you have no idea
what you did for that little boy.

797
00:37:03,388 --> 00:37:04,966
No, no, no. You did it.

798
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:06,322
I mean, you brought him.

799
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:10,193
'Cause I knew you could do it.

800
00:37:11,796 --> 00:37:12,962
Okay.

801
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:14,830
We did it.

802
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:17,333
Just, thank you.

803
00:37:47,332 --> 00:37:49,566
Do you want to go... - Hey.

804
00:37:49,634 --> 00:37:51,117
You ready?

805
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:54,949
Um, Nathan's leaving tomorrow,

806
00:37:54,973 --> 00:37:56,906
so Bailey was gonna
take us out for drinks.

807
00:37:56,975 --> 00:37:58,407
She wanted to hear war stories.

808
00:37:58,477 --> 00:37:59,726
Yeah.

809
00:37:59,794 --> 00:38:01,739
Um, but I could just tell
them that I don't have to go.

810
00:38:01,763 --> 00:38:04,163
Oh, no, no. Come on.
You guys go celebrate.

811
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:05,676
Well, come with
us. Yeah, come on.

812
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,133
I owe you a drink.

813
00:38:08,236 --> 00:38:09,869
Another time.

814
00:38:09,955 --> 00:38:12,155
Really, you guys have fun.

815
00:38:25,703 --> 00:38:27,870
I didn't want Blake
here. I fought it.

816
00:38:27,939 --> 00:38:29,383
Then why did you hire her?

817
00:38:29,407 --> 00:38:31,173
Because I've been
accused of coddling you,

818
00:38:31,226 --> 00:38:32,892
and I didn't want to do that.

819
00:38:32,961 --> 00:38:35,161
I didn't think you'd want me to.

820
00:38:35,229 --> 00:38:36,412
That was one reason.

821
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:40,599
I didn't want you here, either.

822
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,364
When you were
accepted to this program,

823
00:38:43,388 --> 00:38:46,005
I didn't know how I was
gonna look at you every day

824
00:38:46,074 --> 00:38:50,477
and be reminded of the best
and worst times of my life.

825
00:38:50,545 --> 00:38:53,546
And you walked in, the
spitting image of your mother.

826
00:38:54,316 --> 00:38:56,182
Talented, smart.

827
00:38:56,251 --> 00:38:58,818
Here, every day.

828
00:39:00,288 --> 00:39:03,205
And I decided that
wasn't fair to you.

829
00:39:03,274 --> 00:39:06,009
I decided to put aside
my personal feelings to...

830
00:39:06,078 --> 00:39:07,510
Rise above.

831
00:39:08,863 --> 00:39:11,113
And I'm glad I did that.

832
00:39:11,683 --> 00:39:13,082
Every day.

833
00:39:14,786 --> 00:39:16,463
He would have
said the same thing.

834
00:39:16,487 --> 00:39:18,988
Derek. He probably
would have even liked her.

835
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:27,597
Excuse me. I'm
looking for a patient.

836
00:39:27,649 --> 00:39:29,149
Robert Matthews?

837
00:39:29,217 --> 00:39:30,444
Are you his family?

838
00:39:30,468 --> 00:39:32,918
No, I'm... Uh, we work together.

839
00:39:32,988 --> 00:39:34,086
Or worked together.

840
00:39:34,155 --> 00:39:36,622
I'm the choir
director at our church.

841
00:39:36,691 --> 00:39:38,424
Oh. You're the...

842
00:39:38,493 --> 00:39:41,060
Oh. God. You saw it.

843
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:43,797
Well, I mean, of
course you saw it.

844
00:39:43,865 --> 00:39:45,465
All of America saw it.

845
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:47,016
Look, he doesn't deserve this.

846
00:39:47,085 --> 00:39:49,369
It's not fair that he's all
of these amazing things,

847
00:39:49,437 --> 00:39:50,769
and this one mistake

848
00:39:50,838 --> 00:39:52,638
is all anybody's even
gonna think about him.

849
00:39:54,092 --> 00:39:56,125
Look, can I see him, please?

850
00:39:56,194 --> 00:39:58,711
I want him to know that,

851
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:00,100
you know, he's got me, at least.

852
00:40:07,589 --> 00:40:10,774
<i>They say shame controls
every aspect of human behavior.</i>

853
00:40:15,947 --> 00:40:18,564
<i>It's about who
we believe we are.</i>

854
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:25,104
This was a mistake.

855
00:40:26,374 --> 00:40:27,784
I don't think I can do this.

856
00:40:27,808 --> 00:40:31,127
I don't think that
I want to do this.

857
00:40:31,196 --> 00:40:33,496
I kind of went off
on Grey about you.

858
00:40:33,565 --> 00:40:36,249
Callie, why?

859
00:40:36,317 --> 00:40:38,517
Why are you making this harder?

860
00:40:38,586 --> 00:40:40,837
I did what I should've
done at the party.

861
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:46,926
Callie, I get it.

862
00:40:48,296 --> 00:40:50,062
They're your friends.

863
00:40:50,131 --> 00:40:51,363
He was...

864
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:52,849
You're a surgeon.

865
00:40:52,918 --> 00:40:54,733
We make mistakes.

866
00:40:56,855 --> 00:40:58,420
We need to be forgiven.

867
00:41:01,225 --> 00:41:02,826
I will if you will.

868
00:41:04,729 --> 00:41:07,130
And...

869
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,499
I'm here.

870
00:41:11,752 --> 00:41:12,919
If...

871
00:41:14,055 --> 00:41:15,454
If you are.

872
00:41:17,492 --> 00:41:18,690
I'm here, too.

873
00:41:21,313 --> 00:41:23,296
<i>But in the end, you can't hide,</i>

874
00:41:23,364 --> 00:41:25,464
<i>and the body doesn't lie.</i>

875
00:41:29,721 --> 00:41:32,755
<i>The truth is right there
for the world to see.</i>

876
00:41:41,382 --> 00:41:42,782
It's Grey.

877
00:41:43,618 --> 00:41:46,218
She wants me all week. Hmm.

878
00:41:47,155 --> 00:41:49,515
She still wants to work with me?

879
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:51,868
Or she still wants to ruin you.

880
00:41:53,828 --> 00:41:54,977
Yeah.

881
00:41:55,046 --> 00:41:57,213
Yeah, it's definitely
one of those.

882
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:00,265
Come on.

883
00:42:01,786 --> 00:42:05,088
<i>Our shame can choke us, kill us.</i>

884
00:42:07,192 --> 00:42:09,441
It can rot us from the inside

885
00:42:11,245 --> 00:42:13,329
if we decide to let it.

886
00:42:16,751 --> 00:42:18,671
Don't let that happen to you.
