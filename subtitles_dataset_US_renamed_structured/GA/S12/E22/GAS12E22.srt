1
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:04,129
<i>Previously on</i> Grey's Anatomy...

2
00:00:04,622 --> 00:00:06,004
I love you.

3
00:00:06,073 --> 00:00:07,739
<i>I love everything about you.</i>

4
00:00:07,808 --> 00:00:09,624
I get to change lives!
That's the dream!

5
00:00:09,693 --> 00:00:11,571
Fine, I don't want
to go to Africa.

6
00:00:11,595 --> 00:00:13,773
<i>I found out that I'm
pregnant with Mark's baby.</i>

7
00:00:13,797 --> 00:00:15,692
<i>Are you in or are you
out?</i> ARIZONA: <i>I'm in.</i>

8
00:00:15,716 --> 00:00:17,298
Oh, my God!

9
00:00:17,367 --> 00:00:19,601
Callie! Callie!

10
00:00:21,972 --> 00:00:25,024
<i>I choose you to be the one
with whom I spend my life.</i>

11
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,440
<i>Uh, I can't keep doing
this alone, Arizona.</i>

12
00:00:30,264 --> 00:00:32,009
I thought we were
past the hard stuff.

13
00:00:32,033 --> 00:00:33,460
We have a child! I know!

14
00:00:33,484 --> 00:00:36,644
How could you do this? I
don't want to fix us anymore.

15
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:37,920
This is Penny.

16
00:00:37,988 --> 00:00:39,299
<i>Callie's moving to New York.</i>

17
00:00:39,323 --> 00:00:40,817
<i>And she's trying to
take Sofia with her.</i>

18
00:00:40,841 --> 00:00:43,201
You hired a lawyer.
You started this.

19
00:00:49,717 --> 00:00:51,466
<i>There's this Bible story.</i>

20
00:00:51,535 --> 00:00:55,470
<i>Two women, both claim to be
the mother of the same child.</i>

21
00:00:55,539 --> 00:00:58,084
<i>My client is prepared to
offer scheduled visitation</i>

22
00:00:58,108 --> 00:00:59,491
<i>every other weekend.</i>

23
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,071
<i>King Solomon had to choose.</i>

24
00:01:01,095 --> 00:01:02,906
That is ridiculous,
and she knows it.

25
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:05,242
Sofia cannot take a six-hour
flight by herself twice a month.

26
00:01:05,266 --> 00:01:07,346
That would be a
hard no. Hold, please.

27
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:09,279
<i>Two mothers. Only
one gets the kid.</i>

28
00:01:09,303 --> 00:01:10,496
We knew they'd shoot that down.

29
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,865
They are shooting
everything down

30
00:01:11,889 --> 00:01:13,505
because they're
being unreasonable.

31
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:15,518
They have the luxury of
being unreasonable right now.

32
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:17,554
<i>We have less than
12 hours to try to settle.</i>

33
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:19,506
<i>Their witness lineup is
better, and they know it.</i>

34
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:21,496
We have Richard Webber.

35
00:01:24,818 --> 00:01:25,962
Maybe we should
put April on the stand.

36
00:01:25,986 --> 00:01:27,569
Kepner? No!

37
00:01:27,637 --> 00:01:29,332
We're not calling a witness
you just fired as a patient.

38
00:01:29,356 --> 00:01:31,640
But she's seen me with
Sofia more than anyone,

39
00:01:31,708 --> 00:01:33,336
and she's a good
person. She'll tell the truth.

40
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,560
No, she's a wild
card. It's too risky.

41
00:01:37,063 --> 00:01:39,381
Webber's good. He better be.

42
00:01:39,449 --> 00:01:42,434
What is your client prepared
to offer as an alternative?

43
00:01:42,503 --> 00:01:46,287
<i>Solomon came up with a
plan. He proposed a 50/50 split.</i>

44
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:49,857
Visitation rights for Dr. Robbins
on school breaks and summers.

45
00:01:49,926 --> 00:01:51,721
That puts us right
back where we started.

46
00:01:51,745 --> 00:01:53,856
<i>Literally. He offered
to chop the kid in half.</i>

47
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,480
It's a reasonable compromise.

48
00:01:55,549 --> 00:01:57,394
Yeah, well, you can take your
compromise and shove it up your...

49
00:01:57,418 --> 00:01:59,028
Oh, no. You know
what? You can...

50
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:01,636
Arizona, look at me. We
are at an impasse here.

51
00:02:01,705 --> 00:02:04,156
If we don't settle,
if we go to trial,

52
00:02:04,224 --> 00:02:05,974
<i>you risk losing it all.</i>

53
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:09,227
Only one of you is walking out
of that court with sole custody.

54
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:12,230
I am painfully aware of that.

55
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:14,277
Then I urge you to
consider their offer.

56
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:16,118
Their offer is insulting.

57
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:20,488
And last time I checked,
you work for me.

58
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,004
<i>That would be a hard no.</i> Hold.

59
00:02:25,028 --> 00:02:28,263
<i>It all ends if one mom
relinquishes her custody.</i>

60
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:34,786
Gamble.

61
00:02:34,855 --> 00:02:36,455
We're here.

62
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:39,123
<i>Or else they both
stand their ground.</i>

63
00:02:51,405 --> 00:02:53,204
We'll see you in court.

64
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:56,257
<i>And the kid gets torn apart.</i>

65
00:03:21,685 --> 00:03:23,718
Hi, Sofia!

66
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:25,453
Mer will be down in a second.

67
00:03:26,656 --> 00:03:28,190
I'm so sorry about this.

68
00:03:28,258 --> 00:03:30,792
Please. It's the best
way to spend a day off.

69
00:03:32,329 --> 00:03:34,529
Hey, I'm thinking
pancakes for breakfast.

70
00:03:34,597 --> 00:03:36,064
With chocolate chips?

71
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:37,376
Crazytown!

72
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,533
Let's do it.

73
00:03:40,587 --> 00:03:42,687
Does, um, Sofia
know anything about

74
00:03:42,756 --> 00:03:44,867
what her mommies
are doing today? Nope.

75
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:47,704
We're gonna talk to her after we
know exactly what's happening.

76
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:49,260
Hey. You ready?

77
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:56,401
Hey. Come here.

78
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:59,337
Come here. Oh, I'm
gonna miss you so much.

79
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:01,072
You know what?

80
00:04:01,141 --> 00:04:03,808
Mama loves you so, so much.

81
00:04:05,279 --> 00:04:07,361
I will see you again
before you know it.

82
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:09,063
I know.

83
00:04:11,885 --> 00:04:13,651
You're hugging me too tight.

84
00:04:17,407 --> 00:04:19,457
You're hugging me too long.

85
00:04:20,877 --> 00:04:23,495
Callie, we have to go.
We don't want to be late.

86
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:25,831
Come on. Come on.

87
00:04:25,899 --> 00:04:27,866
Come on. Come on. Okay.

88
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:29,501
Hey. Let's go find Zola!

89
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:34,940
Hey.

90
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:36,274
She's gonna be fine.

91
00:04:36,343 --> 00:04:38,076
She's with Maggie.
Okay, come on.

92
00:04:38,144 --> 00:04:39,227
Come on.

93
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,762
It's gonna be okay.

94
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:48,920
This one is deeper
than I would like.

95
00:04:48,988 --> 00:04:50,333
I'll stitch it up.
You have to go.

96
00:04:50,357 --> 00:04:52,590
Is the baby okay?
Let's take a look.

97
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:54,826
Jenny?

98
00:04:54,894 --> 00:04:56,006
Hi, Tara.

99
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:57,991
I heard you fell.
On some dishes.

100
00:04:58,015 --> 00:05:00,865
I was washing them and, uh,
got soapy water all over the floor.

101
00:05:00,934 --> 00:05:03,679
Then I slipped. I told
her I would do them later.

102
00:05:03,703 --> 00:05:06,082
- She's nesting, I think.
- Mom, cut it out.

103
00:05:06,106 --> 00:05:08,990
There is the baby's
heartbeat, nice and steady,

104
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:11,388
and the baby's active, which
is exactly what you want.

105
00:05:11,412 --> 00:05:13,172
I fell really hard.
Are you sure?

106
00:05:13,196 --> 00:05:14,316
Well, the baby looks great,

107
00:05:14,364 --> 00:05:16,025
but I see some free
fluid in your abdomen.

108
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:17,610
It might be bleeding.
Or amniotic fluid.

109
00:05:17,634 --> 00:05:19,329
Jenny, I'm gonna have to
take you up and have a look.

110
00:05:19,353 --> 00:05:21,620
Surgery? No. No surgery.

111
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:23,133
I don't want to go
through that again.

112
00:05:23,157 --> 00:05:24,834
It's nothing. I'm gonna
make a small incision,

113
00:05:24,858 --> 00:05:27,125
put a scope in there, make
sure everything's all right.

114
00:05:27,194 --> 00:05:30,044
You'll be there,
right? I'm sorry.

115
00:05:30,113 --> 00:05:32,414
Actually, I wish I
could. Today I can't.

116
00:05:32,482 --> 00:05:34,098
Dr. Russo will monitor the baby.

117
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,229
He's the OB on
call, and he's great.

118
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:38,264
I will be there, though. I'm happy
to. Don't you need to get going?

119
00:05:38,288 --> 00:05:41,255
Yeah. Um, I will check in later.

120
00:05:41,324 --> 00:05:44,203
Um, Russo's good, but he can be
a little old-school, just so you know.

121
00:05:44,227 --> 00:05:46,561
All right. Go. Okay.

122
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,908
I can't believe you
dumped Kyle with a note.

123
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:51,133
Brutal. Yeah, not
my finest moment.

124
00:05:51,201 --> 00:05:54,602
That's like dumping
someone by text, only in 1980.

125
00:05:54,671 --> 00:05:56,483
Remind me why you
broke up with him at all?

126
00:05:56,507 --> 00:05:57,817
You know why. I know.

127
00:05:57,841 --> 00:05:59,719
It's just that he's so hot

128
00:05:59,743 --> 00:06:02,144
and he's into you
and he plays guitar,

129
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:04,974
and he's sick, so you
always know where he is.

130
00:06:04,998 --> 00:06:06,559
Wow. I know.

131
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:08,561
You had to choose
between doctor and girlfriend.

132
00:06:08,585 --> 00:06:10,530
You made the right
choice. Thank you.

133
00:06:10,554 --> 00:06:13,922
However, there are countless
other brains to cut into

134
00:06:13,991 --> 00:06:16,252
but a limited number
of butts like his.

135
00:06:16,276 --> 00:06:19,093
Keep your eyes on your own butt.

136
00:06:23,667 --> 00:06:26,000
Hey.

137
00:06:26,069 --> 00:06:28,787
Well, I, uh, ground
the beans myself.

138
00:06:28,856 --> 00:06:30,016
Thanks. Let's go.

139
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,155
Wait, wait.

140
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:32,757
We have a few minutes.

141
00:06:32,826 --> 00:06:34,375
How you feeling?

142
00:06:35,963 --> 00:06:37,395
Robbins.

143
00:06:37,464 --> 00:06:40,098
It'll be tough, but right now,
you have to look past the pain

144
00:06:40,167 --> 00:06:42,233
to what you'll have
when they're done.

145
00:06:42,302 --> 00:06:44,180
"At the end, you'll
have a baby."

146
00:06:44,204 --> 00:06:47,084
That's what I tell all
the laboring moms.

147
00:06:48,225 --> 00:06:50,892
You're not drinking. Oh, okay.

148
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:58,590
<i>We're here today</i>

149
00:06:58,619 --> 00:07:01,385
<i>to determine a custody
modification of a minor</i>

150
00:07:01,455 --> 00:07:03,655
between two divorced parents,

151
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:07,092
Arizona Robbins
and Calliope Torres.

152
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:11,562
The trial's witness
pool is unusual

153
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:14,966
in that it'll be shared
by both parents.

154
00:07:15,035 --> 00:07:18,636
The parties have stipulated
to call each witness once,

155
00:07:18,705 --> 00:07:20,955
at which time, each
side will have a chance

156
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:22,957
to examine that witness.

157
00:07:25,294 --> 00:07:28,095
If you're testifying, remember,
this is not a popularity contest.

158
00:07:28,164 --> 00:07:29,714
You are not choosing sides.

159
00:07:30,633 --> 00:07:32,466
We're all on the same side,

160
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:35,487
the side of a 6-year-old child.

161
00:07:35,556 --> 00:07:38,639
Dr. Torres, Dr. Robbins,

162
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,942
custody hearings
are, without exception,

163
00:07:41,011 --> 00:07:43,411
very difficult on
all parties involved,

164
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,779
your daughter included.

165
00:07:44,847 --> 00:07:48,199
Things said here will
undoubtedly be harsh

166
00:07:48,268 --> 00:07:49,834
and cannot be unsaid.

167
00:07:49,903 --> 00:07:54,739
I ask this of parents before
I begin any custody hearing.

168
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:57,108
Are you both sure
you want to proceed?

169
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:02,263
Yes, Your Honor. I'm sure.

170
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:05,266
Dr. Torres.

171
00:08:05,335 --> 00:08:07,602
I'm sure, Your Honor.

172
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:09,281
Then this court
is now in session

173
00:08:09,305 --> 00:08:11,439
to determine sole
physical custody

174
00:08:11,507 --> 00:08:14,409
of Sofia Robbin Sloan Torres.

175
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:24,819
Dr. Torres and I worked
together on a pro bono project

176
00:08:24,887 --> 00:08:26,788
building prosthetics
for injured vets.

177
00:08:26,857 --> 00:08:28,801
And that's a very
meaningful project for you

178
00:08:28,825 --> 00:08:31,687
because you're a vet
yourself. Is that correct?

179
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:33,951
Yes, I served as a
surgeon in the Army.

180
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:38,082
Charity work and the vet card.

181
00:08:38,151 --> 00:08:39,151
That's smart.

182
00:08:39,218 --> 00:08:40,902
Yeah, it's not good for Robbins.

183
00:08:40,971 --> 00:08:42,582
What was the
connection for Dr. Torres?

184
00:08:42,606 --> 00:08:44,322
Well, she just cares.

185
00:08:44,391 --> 00:08:45,590
While she didn't serve,

186
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:48,826
she's always been
willing to pitch in, to help.

187
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,811
She's a very empathetic person.

188
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,513
Big-hearted.

189
00:08:52,582 --> 00:08:55,294
Has Dr. Torres discussed her
move to New York with you?

190
00:08:55,318 --> 00:08:57,814
She has. Did you feel
it was a sudden move?

191
00:08:57,838 --> 00:08:59,904
Um, well, not for her.
I mean, it was sudden

192
00:08:59,973 --> 00:09:01,818
because Dr. Blake's
schedule determined the move,

193
00:09:01,842 --> 00:09:02,923
but for Callie, no.

194
00:09:02,993 --> 00:09:04,359
This is who she is.

195
00:09:04,428 --> 00:09:06,511
She gets thrown a
situation, it doesn't daunt her.

196
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:07,812
It inspires her.

197
00:09:07,864 --> 00:09:09,475
I've seen it time and
time again in the OR.

198
00:09:09,499 --> 00:09:10,865
She just jumps in.

199
00:09:10,934 --> 00:09:12,116
And this is no different.

200
00:09:12,185 --> 00:09:14,118
She's found a great
school for Sofia,

201
00:09:14,187 --> 00:09:19,290
and she's making the best
of a tough situation with grace.

202
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:21,326
It's something I
admire about her.

203
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:29,033
No further
questions at this time.

204
00:09:32,539 --> 00:09:36,674
You live with
Dr. Robbins, don't you?

205
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:39,344
I rent a room in her house.

206
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:42,880
I bet you never expected
to be living with a 6-year-old.

207
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:45,695
Yeah, sure. I wasn't, uh,
thrilled to be living with a kid

208
00:09:45,719 --> 00:09:49,220
uh, till I started
living with one.

209
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:51,166
I had never been
around a lot of kids before,

210
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:52,457
but Sofia's a blast.

211
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:54,925
She's so smart and hilarious.

212
00:09:54,994 --> 00:09:57,729
I mean, she and her mom
are just laughing all the time.

213
00:09:57,797 --> 00:09:59,096
The place is so happy.

214
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:01,599
Sofia makes the place happy.

215
00:10:02,869 --> 00:10:05,436
We see so much dark
stuff every day at work.

216
00:10:05,505 --> 00:10:08,606
It's really nice to come
home to a happy kid.

217
00:10:08,675 --> 00:10:09,915
Mmm.

218
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:15,880
So, would you
say you love Sofia?

219
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:21,636
I... I have come to.
Yes. Oh, that's nice.

220
00:10:21,705 --> 00:10:24,639
And how long have
you known Sofia now?

221
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:26,974
Well, we met a few months ago.

222
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:29,961
Oh, and how well would you
say you've gotten to know Sofia

223
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:32,980
in the few months that you've
spent together, Dr. Blake?

224
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:34,432
Very well.

225
00:10:34,501 --> 00:10:36,629
Oh! Very well. That's good.

226
00:10:36,653 --> 00:10:38,186
That's, uh, very good.

227
00:10:38,955 --> 00:10:40,054
What's her favorite color?

228
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:42,823
Blue. Her favorite toy?

229
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:45,860
Objection. Irrelevant.
This isn't a quiz show.

230
00:10:45,929 --> 00:10:49,814
I'm trying to establish the nature of
Dr. Blake's relationship with Sofia.

231
00:10:49,883 --> 00:10:51,149
I'll allow it.

232
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:55,519
Her favorite toy is
Astronaut Barbie.

233
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:57,905
Her favorite cereal
is Whole Grain O's.

234
00:10:57,974 --> 00:10:59,940
Her favorite
animal is a unicorn.

235
00:11:00,009 --> 00:11:03,344
Her favorite sea
creature is a mermaid.

236
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:05,463
And her bedtime is 8:30.

237
00:11:05,531 --> 00:11:06,943
And her favorite thing
to do in the morning

238
00:11:06,967 --> 00:11:09,517
is pick out her outfit.

239
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:11,552
You can ask me
anything you want.

240
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:16,807
5 millimeter scope.

241
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:20,712
Why aren't you there? In court?

242
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,591
Why aren't you there?

243
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:24,493
I've seen enough
people fighting over kids.

244
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,011
I've had enough of
fighting over my own,

245
00:11:26,035 --> 00:11:27,646
and mine's not even born yet.

246
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:30,571
Well, there's the free fluid.
Suction irrigator, please.

247
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,917
How are we looking
here, Dr. Karev?

248
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:33,724
Uh, well, that's not blood.

249
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:36,521
Oh, no. RUSSO:
Looks like amniotic fluid.

250
00:11:36,545 --> 00:11:38,412
Show me the uterine
fundus, please.

251
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:42,533
Damn it. Uterus is perforated.

252
00:11:42,602 --> 00:11:45,136
Let me have a look
there. Thank you.

253
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:47,939
Getting fluid in her abdomen.

254
00:11:48,008 --> 00:11:50,024
This pregnancy has
just become non-viable.

255
00:11:50,092 --> 00:11:52,138
This baby's barely
viable outside that womb.

256
00:11:52,162 --> 00:11:53,728
It's only 24 weeks.

257
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:55,290
You can repair it, can't you?
- I can try.

258
00:11:55,314 --> 00:11:57,432
Throw in a plasma
patch, hope for the best.

259
00:11:57,501 --> 00:11:59,378
- "Hope for the best"?
- It's experimental.

260
00:11:59,402 --> 00:12:00,996
But if we want to
prolong this pregnancy...

261
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,315
Of course we do. RUSSO:
Then a patch is the way to go.

262
00:12:03,339 --> 00:12:05,467
Five seconds ago,
you wanted to deliver.

263
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:06,969
Now you're confident
in a plasma patch?

264
00:12:06,993 --> 00:12:09,060
Dr. Karev, I am
the OB on call here.

265
00:12:09,129 --> 00:12:10,511
You are a peds surgeon.

266
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:13,348
If I say that a patch
is best, a patch is best.

267
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:14,849
Kepner?

268
00:12:14,918 --> 00:12:17,802
If it keeps the baby
in, I vote for the patch.

269
00:12:17,871 --> 00:12:19,954
Stay in your lane, Dr. Karev.

270
00:12:20,023 --> 00:12:22,540
Prep albumin polymers, please.

271
00:12:22,609 --> 00:12:24,292
I'll update the mom.

272
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:39,624
How'd it go? How's Jenny?

273
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:41,604
Well, she's still in
surgery but doing great.

274
00:12:41,628 --> 00:12:43,172
We located the
source of the leak,

275
00:12:43,196 --> 00:12:45,430
and Dr. Russo's
repairing it right now.

276
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:46,597
And the baby?

277
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:48,877
The baby is healthy
and still in utero,

278
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:50,768
which is what we want.

279
00:12:50,837 --> 00:12:53,221
It's too little to
be born, right?

280
00:12:53,289 --> 00:12:54,822
It wouldn't be ideal.

281
00:12:54,891 --> 00:12:59,393
I need you to sign one more
form for Dr. Russo's repair.

282
00:12:59,462 --> 00:13:01,095
It seems like I was just here

283
00:13:01,164 --> 00:13:03,331
signing these for
Jenny's last surgery.

284
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:08,152
I just had a feeling.

285
00:13:08,221 --> 00:13:10,855
I said goodbye. I left for work.

286
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:12,139
I was two blocks away

287
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:15,643
and I had an awful,
just sick feeling.

288
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:18,012
I turned around, I drove
home, and there she was.

289
00:13:18,081 --> 00:13:21,065
On the floor, blood everywhere.

290
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:22,812
I just had a terrible feeling

291
00:13:22,836 --> 00:13:25,320
that something was really wrong.

292
00:13:26,572 --> 00:13:28,692
It's a good thing you did.

293
00:13:36,016 --> 00:13:39,117
And your work schedule will
be pretty grueling, I'd imagine.

294
00:13:39,186 --> 00:13:41,080
Actually, it's a
research fellowship,

295
00:13:41,104 --> 00:13:43,137
so it will be far
more predictable

296
00:13:43,223 --> 00:13:44,822
than a surgery
resident's schedule.

297
00:13:44,891 --> 00:13:46,891
Oh, I see.

298
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,227
What was Sofia
wearing this morning?

299
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:50,856
What? What was
she wearing today?

300
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,896
I...

301
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:55,377
I don't know. You didn't
see her this morning?

302
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:57,952
No, I did. I just...

303
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:00,704
I can't, uh, recall
exactly what it...

304
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:02,156
Objection. Relevance.

305
00:14:02,224 --> 00:14:03,624
Moving on.

306
00:14:03,693 --> 00:14:05,960
What grade is Sofia in?

307
00:14:06,029 --> 00:14:07,545
Second.

308
00:14:07,614 --> 00:14:08,614
No, first.

309
00:14:10,282 --> 00:14:12,299
She's in first grade.

310
00:14:12,368 --> 00:14:15,619
I have to go, and this
is getting hard to watch.

311
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:17,683
Are you sure? PENNY: Yes.

312
00:14:17,707 --> 00:14:19,134
Because you didn't sound sure,

313
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:21,053
and you keep saying this
is a child that you know,

314
00:14:21,077 --> 00:14:24,028
a child that you're
gonna soon co-parent.

315
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:26,675
I can see how you
might not remember

316
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,060
what color tutu she
wore to school today,

317
00:14:28,084 --> 00:14:29,745
but to not even know
what grade she's in...

318
00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:32,820
So many objections.
Badgering, irrelevant...

319
00:14:32,889 --> 00:14:34,622
Sustained. I'm sorry.

320
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:36,452
I don't mean to belabor the
point, but you said it yourself.

321
00:14:36,476 --> 00:14:38,754
You've only known
Sofia a few months, so...

322
00:14:38,778 --> 00:14:40,298
No, that is not what I meant.

323
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:42,706
But that is what you said.

324
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:45,016
All right, Counselor.

325
00:14:45,085 --> 00:14:46,884
I know what grade she's in.

326
00:14:46,953 --> 00:14:48,836
I do. I do.

327
00:14:48,905 --> 00:14:50,985
No further questions,
Your Honor.

328
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:13,255
Maybe it wasn't that bad.

329
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,319
That was really, really bad.

330
00:15:15,398 --> 00:15:18,399
Oh, God.

331
00:15:18,467 --> 00:15:20,484
But it doesn't kill us. Not yet.

332
00:15:20,553 --> 00:15:22,998
I can't believe Arizona
let them pull that slimy bull.

333
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:24,538
It was a smart
move, and it worked.

334
00:15:24,607 --> 00:15:25,767
But we've got smarter moves.

335
00:15:25,808 --> 00:15:27,536
I'm gonna put Dr. Grey
on the stand tomorrow,

336
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,293
and she's gonna close strong.

337
00:15:29,362 --> 00:15:30,728
Look confident.

338
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,200
You're the Chief of Surgery.

339
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:38,669
Doctors Torres and
Robbins report to you.

340
00:15:38,738 --> 00:15:40,138
That is correct.

341
00:15:40,206 --> 00:15:42,184
And for those of us
who aren't surgeons,

342
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:44,019
Dr. Torres operates on bones

343
00:15:44,043 --> 00:15:45,588
while Dr. Robbins
operates on babies.

344
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:46,655
Is that correct?

345
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:48,179
Well, fetuses and babies.

346
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:49,681
Yes.

347
00:15:49,749 --> 00:15:51,026
How does the schedule
of an orthopedic surgeon

348
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:52,861
compare to that
of a fetal surgeon?

349
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:54,480
Well, it varies day to day.

350
00:15:54,504 --> 00:15:55,998
I see, but in your opinion,

351
00:15:56,022 --> 00:15:59,423
which specialty has more
unscheduled surgeries?

352
00:15:59,492 --> 00:16:02,309
Ortho or fetal? There's
really no comparison.

353
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:04,156
But Dr. Robbins'
schedule is dictated

354
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:06,813
by the unpredictable
nature of childbirth, is it not?

355
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:08,562
Objection. Speculation.

356
00:16:09,485 --> 00:16:12,754
She can't do that.
You can't do that.

357
00:16:12,822 --> 00:16:14,822
I asked if Dr. Robbins' schedule

358
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:18,276
is dictated by the
unpredictable nature of childbirth.

359
00:16:18,345 --> 00:16:20,189
Objection. Speculation.

360
00:16:20,213 --> 00:16:23,175
Your Honor, I'm asking an
expert witness her opinion.

361
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:25,611
It's only speculation if
counsel is calling into question

362
00:16:25,635 --> 00:16:27,279
the expertise of
this witness as Chief.

363
00:16:27,303 --> 00:16:29,186
Overruled. Counselor, proceed.

364
00:16:29,255 --> 00:16:32,655
Dr. Robbins' schedule is
unpredictable, wouldn't you say?

365
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,428
It can be, yes. Any surgeon's...

366
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:40,192
Sure, but how many unscheduled
emergency procedures

367
00:16:40,216 --> 00:16:42,816
did Dr. Robbins log
over the past six months?

368
00:16:42,885 --> 00:16:44,268
I have no idea.

369
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:47,038
I would like to introduce
into evidence Document 2C.

370
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:53,838
Take a look. This might
refresh your memory.

371
00:16:53,862 --> 00:16:55,106
What is that report, Doctor?

372
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:59,266
This is a list of emergency
procedures performed

373
00:16:59,335 --> 00:17:02,753
by Dr. Robbins and Dr. Torres
for the past six months.

374
00:17:02,822 --> 00:17:04,200
And according to that document,

375
00:17:04,224 --> 00:17:07,175
how many emergency
procedures did Dr. Torres log

376
00:17:07,243 --> 00:17:08,575
in the past six months?

377
00:17:10,914 --> 00:17:13,380
Twenty-seven. Twenty-seven.

378
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:15,649
And how many did
Dr. Robbins log?

379
00:17:20,924 --> 00:17:22,039
Ninety-two.

380
00:17:22,992 --> 00:17:24,542
Ninety-two.

381
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:25,910
Now, even for a surgeon,

382
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:27,923
wouldn't you call that
kind of schedule grueling?

383
00:17:27,947 --> 00:17:29,413
You can say that. I wouldn't.

384
00:17:29,482 --> 00:17:31,682
I would say it's
wildly successful,

385
00:17:31,751 --> 00:17:34,552
but then, I would never
put a woman's success

386
00:17:34,621 --> 00:17:36,136
in the con column.

387
00:17:36,205 --> 00:17:38,133
What about her daughter, though?

388
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:39,234
Ninety-two.

389
00:17:39,258 --> 00:17:41,542
Ninety-two times she
dropped everything,

390
00:17:41,611 --> 00:17:45,362
Sofia included, to go to a job.

391
00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:47,247
Would you ask that
if she were a man?

392
00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:52,419
Ninety-two times she
chose work over her child.

393
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:53,670
Your Honor...

394
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:56,907
Ninety-two times
Dr. Robbins was saving babies,

395
00:17:56,976 --> 00:17:59,393
saving parents from
losing their own children!

396
00:18:00,864 --> 00:18:02,597
No further questions.

397
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,466
Don't get discouraged.

398
00:18:05,535 --> 00:18:08,680
They're trying to turn your
strength into weakness.

399
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:14,158
This court is adjourned
until tomorrow.

400
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:23,301
No, over here. Right
up against the bed.

401
00:18:23,369 --> 00:18:25,702
God, Mom. Just go home to sleep.

402
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,338
This is so embarrassing.

403
00:18:27,407 --> 00:18:29,067
I'm sorry. She's a nightmare.

404
00:18:29,091 --> 00:18:32,009
That's right. I'm
everybody's nightmare.

405
00:18:32,078 --> 00:18:33,722
Can I have another blanket, please?
- Sure.

406
00:18:33,746 --> 00:18:35,730
Hey! How's everyone feeling?

407
00:18:35,798 --> 00:18:37,732
I hear you're
sleeping over tonight.

408
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,061
Thank God you're back. She's
nicer to me when you're around.

409
00:18:40,085 --> 00:18:41,285
Surgery went well?

410
00:18:41,354 --> 00:18:42,869
Yeah. Russo did a plasma patch.

411
00:18:42,938 --> 00:18:45,957
Yeah, that's a good call.
This baby needs more time.

412
00:18:46,025 --> 00:18:48,403
Okay, listen. I'm sorry that I
wasn't here for the surgery,

413
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:50,828
but I'll be checking
in later, okay?

414
00:18:54,734 --> 00:18:56,600
I told you. Kepner and
I have Jenny handled.

415
00:18:56,669 --> 00:18:58,869
She's doing fine. The baby's
good. Everyone's stable.

416
00:18:58,938 --> 00:19:00,237
Um, where's Russo?

417
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:01,171
I need to look at a
post-op ultrasound

418
00:19:01,224 --> 00:19:02,333
to make sure the leak is sealed.

419
00:19:02,357 --> 00:19:03,924
Should you be here?

420
00:19:03,993 --> 00:19:06,154
Shouldn't you be at home getting
ready for court or something?

421
00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:07,356
No. I shouldn't be here.

422
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,146
I should be at home

423
00:19:09,215 --> 00:19:10,609
fixing my daughter ice cream
and reading her <i>Charlotte's Web.</i>

424
00:19:10,633 --> 00:19:12,444
So could you please page Russo

425
00:19:12,468 --> 00:19:14,596
so I can look at the ultrasounds
and get the hell out of here?

426
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:15,636
Okay.

427
00:19:15,704 --> 00:19:16,937
Thank you.

428
00:19:20,276 --> 00:19:21,954
It's an impossible situation.

429
00:19:21,978 --> 00:19:23,622
A break-up is tough
enough as it is,

430
00:19:23,646 --> 00:19:25,090
but with a kid in the mix...

431
00:19:25,114 --> 00:19:27,314
I can't even imagine.

432
00:19:27,383 --> 00:19:29,160
I mean, just because you're not
the parent who gave birth to the kid

433
00:19:29,184 --> 00:19:30,445
doesn't make the
kid any less yours.

434
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:31,769
Biology or not,

435
00:19:31,838 --> 00:19:34,321
no parent ever fought
to stick around for me.

436
00:19:36,192 --> 00:19:38,258
It was a horrible mistake.

437
00:19:38,327 --> 00:19:40,811
The custody battle? Me
breaking up with Kyle.

438
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,780
I told you that. Who's Kyle?

439
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:44,531
He was a
once-in-a-lifetime butt.

440
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,800
I said that, too.

441
00:19:45,868 --> 00:19:47,735
I'm calling him. Ooh.

442
00:19:47,804 --> 00:19:49,080
Mmm, the drunk-dial.

443
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:50,466
It's a bad idea. I'm not drunk.

444
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:51,856
Hey! Steph, look at me.

445
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:54,241
You have 10 more
seconds to talk about him,

446
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:56,043
and then no more Kyle talk.

447
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:58,245
I said that to you. I know.

448
00:19:58,314 --> 00:20:00,347
Ten, nine...

449
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:02,177
Shut up. I'm calling him.

450
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:04,634
And it is not
drunk-dialing, sir.

451
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:07,070
It is me undoing my mistake.

452
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:08,522
Okay. I...

453
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:10,691
Give it back. No.

454
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,604
You are a good friend.

455
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:13,628
I know.

456
00:20:17,182 --> 00:20:19,662
So, what were you thinking?

457
00:20:19,818 --> 00:20:21,218
Okay, um...

458
00:20:22,288 --> 00:20:23,987
When the baby's born...

459
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,405
Starting Day 1, huh?

460
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:29,643
I would like to be in
the room for the birth.

461
00:20:29,712 --> 00:20:32,580
So if that makes you
uncomfortable... No, not at all.

462
00:20:33,683 --> 00:20:35,248
Really? Yeah.

463
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:36,557
Yeah, I want you there.

464
00:20:36,586 --> 00:20:38,603
Okay, um...

465
00:20:38,671 --> 00:20:41,138
Well, when the baby's
on a feeding schedule,

466
00:20:41,207 --> 00:20:43,624
whenever that happens,
then I'm thinking weekends?

467
00:20:43,692 --> 00:20:44,953
You don't want
to split the week?

468
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:46,410
I do. Yes.

469
00:20:46,479 --> 00:20:47,719
But when the baby's older,

470
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,124
we may need to switch
to every other week.

471
00:20:49,148 --> 00:20:51,359
I've read that that is
just... Easier on the child.

472
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:52,733
Yeah, I read that, too.

473
00:20:52,801 --> 00:20:54,763
But I want Easter.
It's important to me.

474
00:20:54,787 --> 00:20:57,933
I go to church, and you...
Worship the Easter bunny.

475
00:20:57,957 --> 00:20:59,707
Right.

476
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:01,509
Now, are we talking
Easter egg hunts

477
00:21:01,577 --> 00:21:02,776
or just church?

478
00:21:02,845 --> 00:21:04,273
Yeah, of course there
will be an Easter egg hunt.

479
00:21:04,297 --> 00:21:07,598
All right, then
Easter's all yours.

480
00:21:07,667 --> 00:21:09,945
Uh, and you can have the
Super Bowl and Halloween.

481
00:21:09,969 --> 00:21:11,969
Mmm, sure.

482
00:21:12,037 --> 00:21:14,972
Okay, now, what
about, uh, Christmas?

483
00:21:19,962 --> 00:21:21,195
We switch off.

484
00:21:21,264 --> 00:21:24,464
We switch off. We,
uh, make a plan.

485
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:26,133
We respect the plan.

486
00:21:27,153 --> 00:21:28,836
We don't fight.

487
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:32,590
Yeah, we don't fight.

488
00:21:37,497 --> 00:21:39,013
Okay, sweetie.

489
00:21:39,081 --> 00:21:40,826
Yeah, no, it's
past your bedtime.

490
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:42,583
Okay. Hey.

491
00:21:42,652 --> 00:21:45,052
I love you.

492
00:21:45,855 --> 00:21:47,354
Okay. No, no, no.

493
00:21:47,423 --> 00:21:49,367
No, I don't want to
talk to Mommy, okay?

494
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:50,791
Okay, bye...

495
00:21:54,864 --> 00:21:56,964
I feel gross.

496
00:21:57,033 --> 00:21:59,344
I feel gross. Court covered
me in a layer of gross

497
00:21:59,368 --> 00:22:01,735
no amount of wine can wash away.

498
00:22:03,673 --> 00:22:05,705
Tequila? Mmm-mmm.

499
00:22:05,774 --> 00:22:07,386
You know, you
don't have to stay.

500
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:10,322
I'll be fine alone till
Penny gets home. Mmm.

501
00:22:10,346 --> 00:22:11,912
That won't be for hours.

502
00:22:11,981 --> 00:22:15,532
I buried her in
scut and post-ops.

503
00:22:15,601 --> 00:22:17,901
I'll call you a cab. Go
home and see your kids.

504
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:19,486
My kids are asleep.

505
00:22:19,555 --> 00:22:21,372
They're with Maggie and Amelia.

506
00:22:26,896 --> 00:22:29,562
What if last night
was our last night?

507
00:22:29,631 --> 00:22:30,631
Stop. Don't do that.

508
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:33,050
I am doing this all wrong.

509
00:22:35,838 --> 00:22:37,120
Mark used to say that.

510
00:22:42,662 --> 00:22:44,761
You know...

511
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:48,098
When the kids were babies,
he used to call me all the time,

512
00:22:48,167 --> 00:22:51,368
when Sofia would cry
or she got soap in her eye

513
00:22:51,437 --> 00:22:53,037
and he didn't know what to do.

514
00:22:53,088 --> 00:22:55,408
He called you? He had two moms!

515
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:59,493
Yeah, but the two of
you were so on top of it,

516
00:22:59,561 --> 00:23:00,761
he didn't want you to know.

517
00:23:00,797 --> 00:23:02,797
So he swore me to secrecy.

518
00:23:05,567 --> 00:23:07,001
He would hate this.

519
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:09,503
So much.

520
00:23:11,073 --> 00:23:13,273
He would find it unacceptable.

521
00:23:19,832 --> 00:23:21,097
I lie awake every night

522
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:24,606
thinking maybe I started
something I shouldn't have.

523
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:29,718
I shouldn't have to choose
between the person that I love

524
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:31,308
and the person I love.

525
00:23:35,114 --> 00:23:36,880
I hope you don't have to.

526
00:23:39,768 --> 00:23:42,502
I tried not to love Penny, Mer.

527
00:23:42,571 --> 00:23:43,703
I tried.

528
00:23:44,439 --> 00:23:45,873
So hard.

529
00:23:50,195 --> 00:23:52,362
I know. This all sucks.

530
00:24:03,008 --> 00:24:04,319
Come on, Sofia, honey.

531
00:24:04,343 --> 00:24:05,654
You had a really good time
with her yesterday, okay?

532
00:24:05,678 --> 00:24:07,155
Uh-uh. Yes! You did.

533
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:10,047
You built forts and
it was really fun.

534
00:24:10,116 --> 00:24:11,996
Morning! Come on
in! Hi! Here we go!

535
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:13,500
I don't want to.

536
00:24:13,569 --> 00:24:15,363
I'm sorry. It's been a
really rough morning.

537
00:24:15,387 --> 00:24:17,766
She woke up really early and then
she didn't have breakfast, so, uh...

538
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:19,818
That's okay. We will
make waffles, or...

539
00:24:19,842 --> 00:24:21,308
I'm going with you.

540
00:24:21,377 --> 00:24:24,111
I can't. Oh, I can't.
Mommy can't today.

541
00:24:24,179 --> 00:24:25,674
I'm running late, and
you're here to play with Zola,

542
00:24:25,698 --> 00:24:27,109
but I will be back
just as soon as I can.

543
00:24:27,133 --> 00:24:28,593
No.

544
00:24:28,617 --> 00:24:29,816
I'm sorry.

545
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:31,401
I'm sorry. I love you.

546
00:24:31,471 --> 00:24:32,514
I hate you.

547
00:24:32,538 --> 00:24:34,565
Okay, let's go find Zola.

548
00:24:34,589 --> 00:24:35,934
She'll be fine.

549
00:24:37,577 --> 00:24:39,309
Hey. How's Jenny doing?

550
00:24:39,378 --> 00:24:40,618
She did okay overnight,

551
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:41,957
but her mean pressure
is trending down.

552
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:43,859
I don't like it. What
does Russo say?

553
00:24:43,883 --> 00:24:45,393
Russo says to watch and wait,

554
00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:47,546
but I'm thinking
about texting Arizona.

555
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:48,947
Arizona doesn't
have all the answers.

556
00:24:48,971 --> 00:24:50,715
She has more answers than Russo.

557
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:52,650
And you're just pissy because
she fired you as a patient.

558
00:24:52,674 --> 00:24:54,252
Shut up. She's got
enough on her plate today.

559
00:24:54,276 --> 00:24:55,954
Okay, look. If Russo
says watch and wait,

560
00:24:55,978 --> 00:24:57,277
I say we watch and wait.

561
00:24:57,346 --> 00:24:59,057
Any evidence of fetal
distress on the monitor,

562
00:24:59,081 --> 00:25:00,530
just let me know, okay?

563
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:05,819
And Dr. Torres and Sofia
couldn't possibly be any closer.

564
00:25:05,888 --> 00:25:08,033
So, you've seen them together
frequently over the years.

565
00:25:08,057 --> 00:25:10,273
All the time. They went
to the same daycare

566
00:25:10,343 --> 00:25:11,909
and now they're
at the same school.

567
00:25:11,978 --> 00:25:14,495
Sofia's actually at
my house right now.

568
00:25:14,563 --> 00:25:15,840
And what about Dr. Blake?

569
00:25:15,864 --> 00:25:17,609
In your estimation, how
does she get along with Sofia?

570
00:25:17,633 --> 00:25:19,266
Great. Sofia loves Penny.

571
00:25:19,335 --> 00:25:20,885
She's a great kid like that.

572
00:25:20,953 --> 00:25:23,231
She's very open to new people
as long as they're good people,

573
00:25:23,255 --> 00:25:25,472
and Penny is a very good person.

574
00:25:26,926 --> 00:25:28,392
Thank you, Dr. Grey.

575
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:31,311
It's your witness, Ms. Gamble.

576
00:25:31,379 --> 00:25:35,199
You mentioned that Sofia is
at your house today, Dr. Grey.

577
00:25:35,267 --> 00:25:37,696
She is. It must be nice
for you and Dr. Torres

578
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,114
to have daughters
around the same age.

579
00:25:39,138 --> 00:25:41,316
And they get along,
right? It is very nice.

580
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:43,274
They love playing together.

581
00:25:43,326 --> 00:25:45,270
So, who's watching your daughters
right now while you're here?

582
00:25:45,294 --> 00:25:47,428
Their Aunt Amelia.

583
00:25:47,496 --> 00:25:50,896
You recently lost your
husband. Is that correct?

584
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,917
I did.

585
00:25:53,985 --> 00:25:55,919
My sincerest condolences.

586
00:25:55,987 --> 00:25:58,038
Thank you.

587
00:25:58,107 --> 00:26:01,191
So, you're a single parent.

588
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,861
I am. And Callie's
a single parent.

589
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:07,304
Is that a question, or...

590
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:09,883
So you two must help
each other out a lot.

591
00:26:09,951 --> 00:26:11,162
Two single parents.

592
00:26:11,186 --> 00:26:13,231
Callie drops Sofia off
at your place sometimes

593
00:26:13,255 --> 00:26:15,100
when she has to work
or when she has plans

594
00:26:15,124 --> 00:26:18,058
or when she needs
a night off. Correct?

595
00:26:18,126 --> 00:26:19,309
A "night off"?

596
00:26:20,646 --> 00:26:22,512
Being a mom isn't a job.

597
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:24,301
We don't punch in and punch out.

598
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:26,099
There are no nights off.

599
00:26:26,168 --> 00:26:27,668
We are both single parents.

600
00:26:27,736 --> 00:26:29,419
That's not a dirty word.

601
00:26:29,488 --> 00:26:32,656
But we do need help getting
our kids to where they need to be

602
00:26:32,724 --> 00:26:34,485
with all of their limbs intact.

603
00:26:34,509 --> 00:26:36,327
So we lean on each other.

604
00:26:36,395 --> 00:26:38,796
That's not a sign of
weakness or bad parenting,

605
00:26:38,864 --> 00:26:40,464
if that's where
you're going with this.

606
00:26:40,516 --> 00:26:44,017
It takes a village,
and we have a village.

607
00:26:44,086 --> 00:26:45,869
Here in Seattle. What?

608
00:26:45,938 --> 00:26:47,382
The village you
just mentioned...

609
00:26:47,406 --> 00:26:49,807
The seamless support
system these mothers built,

610
00:26:49,875 --> 00:26:51,442
this essential network.

611
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:53,644
It's all here in Seattle.

612
00:26:53,712 --> 00:26:56,241
Sofia's friends and her
school, her teachers...

613
00:26:56,265 --> 00:26:59,066
Her home is here in Seattle.

614
00:26:59,134 --> 00:27:02,369
That's what Sofia
would be leaving.

615
00:27:02,438 --> 00:27:03,482
Is that what you're saying?

616
00:27:03,506 --> 00:27:05,221
No. I was saying...

617
00:27:05,291 --> 00:27:07,574
No further questions,
Your Honor.

618
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:17,601
Dr. Robbins was already
a brilliant pediatric surgeon,

619
00:27:17,669 --> 00:27:20,036
but since she's
completed her fellowship,

620
00:27:20,105 --> 00:27:21,572
I've watched her turn into

621
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,990
one of the most renowned
fetal surgeons in the country.

622
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:26,710
A child would be lucky to
have her as a role model parent.

623
00:27:28,396 --> 00:27:30,476
No further questions,
Your Honor.

624
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:37,988
Dr. Webber, you work with
Dr. Robbins, is that correct?

625
00:27:38,056 --> 00:27:39,490
Uh, yes, that's
correct. Mmm-hmm.

626
00:27:39,558 --> 00:27:42,103
Would you say there's overlap
between your specialties?

627
00:27:42,127 --> 00:27:43,277
Yes, there is.

628
00:27:43,362 --> 00:27:45,963
So, you two have gotten
close over the years.

629
00:27:46,031 --> 00:27:47,951
Professionally. We have. Yes.

630
00:27:54,556 --> 00:27:55,796
Are you a trivia buff?

631
00:27:58,694 --> 00:28:00,043
Yes.

632
00:28:00,112 --> 00:28:02,457
So, you and Dr. Robbins have
enjoyed trivia nights together.

633
00:28:02,481 --> 00:28:03,514
That's correct, yes.

634
00:28:03,582 --> 00:28:05,693
You go and play, drink,
and flirt with women.

635
00:28:05,717 --> 00:28:07,062
Is that correct? No, it isn't.

636
00:28:07,086 --> 00:28:08,818
I'm married and I don't drink.

637
00:28:08,888 --> 00:28:10,415
So Dr. Robbins did all
the drinking and flirting.

638
00:28:10,439 --> 00:28:12,116
You just went for the trivia?

639
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:15,275
That's an over-simplified... It's a
yes or no question, Dr. Webber.

640
00:28:15,344 --> 00:28:18,344
Yes. You're good at trivia?

641
00:28:18,647 --> 00:28:20,291
Sure. Don't be modest.

642
00:28:20,315 --> 00:28:22,949
How many times do you think
you and Dr. Robbins have won

643
00:28:23,018 --> 00:28:25,047
over the past, oh,
let's say, six months?

644
00:28:25,071 --> 00:28:26,948
I wasn't counting. The bar was.

645
00:28:26,972 --> 00:28:28,884
They kept a running tally.

646
00:28:28,908 --> 00:28:32,042
Does this piece of
evidence, Document 3C,

647
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:35,028
refresh your recollection?

648
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,884
You've won 25 times
in the past six months.

649
00:28:40,953 --> 00:28:43,664
That's 25 nights Dr. Robbins
was out drinking with you,

650
00:28:43,688 --> 00:28:45,989
not including the
times you lost.

651
00:28:48,127 --> 00:28:49,470
Where was Sofia
during those evenings?

652
00:28:49,494 --> 00:28:50,927
I don't know.

653
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:52,440
I'm sorry. I didn't... I
didn't quite catch that.

654
00:28:52,464 --> 00:28:55,248
I said I wasn't privy to
her childcare schedule.

655
00:28:55,317 --> 00:28:57,850
I would like to introduce
into evidence Document 4C.

656
00:28:57,919 --> 00:28:59,870
It is a transcript
of text messages

657
00:28:59,938 --> 00:29:02,216
from Dr. Robbins to Dr. Torres

658
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,486
asking her to take
Sofia unexpectedly.

659
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:06,053
Callie and I swap all the time.

660
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:08,729
We have very flexible
schedules. Shh.

661
00:29:08,797 --> 00:29:10,608
Could you please tell the court

662
00:29:10,632 --> 00:29:12,165
the tally at the bottom?

663
00:29:15,337 --> 00:29:17,221
Dr. Webber?

664
00:29:18,624 --> 00:29:19,868
Thirty-four. Thirty-four.

665
00:29:19,892 --> 00:29:23,594
She asked Dr. Torres to
switch with her 34 times.

666
00:29:23,662 --> 00:29:26,525
We know she was out
with you at least 25 times.

667
00:29:26,549 --> 00:29:28,543
And that's in addition to
the previously mentioned

668
00:29:28,567 --> 00:29:31,384
ninety-two times
Dr. Robbins was unavailable

669
00:29:31,453 --> 00:29:34,416
to parent her own child due
to her professional demands.

670
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:38,058
Now, let's just pause and
think about this for a minute.

671
00:29:38,144 --> 00:29:41,077
There are only 180
days in six months' time,

672
00:29:41,146 --> 00:29:43,864
and so far, we've counted
approximately 150 times

673
00:29:43,932 --> 00:29:46,010
in which Dr. Robbins
shirked her duties.

674
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:47,900
150 out of 180.

675
00:29:47,969 --> 00:29:49,765
Objection. Badgering
the witness.

676
00:29:49,789 --> 00:29:52,322
Calls for speculation.
Sustained.

677
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:55,341
Your Honor, we'd like
to request a short recess.

678
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:06,347
So, Callie's okay
slut-shaming me now?

679
00:30:06,371 --> 00:30:08,221
Don't let them rattle you.

680
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:10,134
They're making it sound like
a working mom is a bad mom.

681
00:30:10,158 --> 00:30:11,502
I mean, we just
lost in there, right?

682
00:30:11,526 --> 00:30:12,703
'Cause they made me sound like

683
00:30:12,727 --> 00:30:15,323
I was a selfish,
irresponsible, sex-crazed...

684
00:30:15,347 --> 00:30:17,187
Arizona. Stop. I don't...

685
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:19,582
You have your chance right now.

686
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:21,318
They tried to rewrite the story.

687
00:30:21,386 --> 00:30:23,069
Now's your chance
to set it straight.

688
00:30:23,138 --> 00:30:26,390
You need to get up
there, tell them the truth.

689
00:30:26,458 --> 00:30:27,724
Judge Kane is smart.

690
00:30:27,793 --> 00:30:29,860
She'll know the truth
when she hears it.

691
00:30:29,928 --> 00:30:32,612
You tell the truth,
and you will win this.

692
00:30:34,983 --> 00:30:37,645
When Sofia was born, how
did that day start for you?

693
00:30:39,704 --> 00:30:41,604
I was in a car accident.

694
00:30:44,126 --> 00:30:47,511
Can you tell us what you
remember about the accident?

695
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:50,814
I don't remember
much, but I remember...

696
00:30:52,484 --> 00:30:54,585
I remember waking up
on the hood of the car

697
00:30:55,987 --> 00:30:58,955
and I was covered in glass.

698
00:31:00,593 --> 00:31:02,892
I was, um, barely...

699
00:31:02,961 --> 00:31:04,494
I'm so sorry.

700
00:31:06,214 --> 00:31:08,374
Take all the time you need.

701
00:31:19,194 --> 00:31:21,962
I was barely conscious, um,

702
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:25,565
and the only thing that I
could feel was just pain all over.

703
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:32,205
I could have died on
the hood of that car.

704
00:31:32,274 --> 00:31:34,741
And I wanted to give up.

705
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:37,027
But...

706
00:31:37,096 --> 00:31:39,596
I couldn't because I
was pregnant with Sofia.

707
00:31:41,666 --> 00:31:44,801
And if I died, she died.

708
00:31:45,871 --> 00:31:47,237
So...

709
00:31:48,707 --> 00:31:50,040
I had to fight

710
00:31:51,377 --> 00:31:54,278
to stay alive, for
my daughter's sake.

711
00:31:57,816 --> 00:32:00,284
Being a mother is the
reason I'm still alive today.

712
00:32:16,902 --> 00:32:18,813
Jenny, your BP's borderline low,

713
00:32:18,837 --> 00:32:21,505
but otherwise, your
cardiac evaluation is good.

714
00:32:21,573 --> 00:32:23,184
So, she's cleared for surgery.

715
00:32:23,208 --> 00:32:25,353
Surgery. What surgery?
What happened?

716
00:32:25,377 --> 00:32:27,778
Dr. Russo says
we have to deliver.

717
00:32:27,846 --> 00:32:29,791
Jenny's still leaking
amniotic fluid,

718
00:32:29,815 --> 00:32:31,476
which means we're out of time.

719
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,500
We need to do a
C-section, deliver this baby.

720
00:32:33,568 --> 00:32:35,446
Right now? It's
too early, right?

721
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:38,037
It's not ideal, but
there may be no choice.

722
00:32:38,106 --> 00:32:39,772
Please don't. Not yet.

723
00:32:39,841 --> 00:32:41,102
I don't want my baby to die.

724
00:32:41,126 --> 00:32:42,976
Honey, everything
is gonna be fine.

725
00:32:43,045 --> 00:32:44,245
Can I see you outside?

726
00:32:49,401 --> 00:32:51,067
If that baby comes out now...

727
00:32:51,136 --> 00:32:52,935
It has to.

728
00:32:53,004 --> 00:32:56,033
The fetal heart rate's already
showing decreased variability.

729
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:57,657
Well, what can we do?

730
00:32:57,725 --> 00:32:59,553
I can deliver, then you do
what you can for the baby.

731
00:32:59,577 --> 00:33:01,956
Look, it's hard to keep those
babies alive. The odds suck.

732
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,130
Compromised lungs,
high risk of brain bleeds.

733
00:33:04,199 --> 00:33:06,328
It's the only option left.

734
00:33:06,352 --> 00:33:07,950
It's what we're doing.

735
00:33:09,971 --> 00:33:11,521
So, I just lied to my daughter,

736
00:33:11,589 --> 00:33:13,039
and I will go back in there

737
00:33:13,108 --> 00:33:15,541
and keep telling her that
she'll be okay no matter what,

738
00:33:15,611 --> 00:33:17,589
but to do that, I need to
know that you have done

739
00:33:17,613 --> 00:33:20,096
everything in your
power to make this okay.

740
00:33:20,165 --> 00:33:21,414
Can you tell me that?

741
00:33:21,483 --> 00:33:23,550
Tell me that you have
done everything you can

742
00:33:23,619 --> 00:33:26,185
to keep my baby
and grandchild alive.

743
00:33:30,843 --> 00:33:32,776
Robbins wouldn't deliver.

744
00:33:32,845 --> 00:33:34,925
Do you have another option?

745
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:39,359
Then I'll see you in surgery.

746
00:33:40,668 --> 00:33:42,269
Is Robbins an option?

747
00:33:42,604 --> 00:33:43,870
No.

748
00:33:52,714 --> 00:33:55,248
Dr. Robbins, you
were with Dr. Torres

749
00:33:55,317 --> 00:33:56,766
before she was pregnant. Yes.

750
00:33:56,834 --> 00:33:57,834
Were you together

751
00:33:57,903 --> 00:33:58,980
when she got pregnant? No.

752
00:33:59,004 --> 00:34:00,382
So her pregnancy
was not an agreement

753
00:34:00,406 --> 00:34:02,032
you entered into
together, correct?

754
00:34:02,056 --> 00:34:04,107
No.

755
00:34:04,176 --> 00:34:05,887
It was an agreement she entered
into with Dr. Mark Sloan, correct?

756
00:34:05,911 --> 00:34:07,321
They agreed after the fact,

757
00:34:07,345 --> 00:34:08,978
but, yes, Mark
was Sofia's father.

758
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,513
Callie and I were together.

759
00:34:10,582 --> 00:34:12,249
We were a couple
before the pregnancy

760
00:34:12,317 --> 00:34:13,934
and then after
Sofia was conceived.

761
00:34:14,002 --> 00:34:17,153
So, you became part of the
parenting plan later, correct?

762
00:34:17,222 --> 00:34:18,682
Just to be clear,

763
00:34:18,706 --> 00:34:21,575
Dr. Sloan and Dr. Torres
were Sofia's parents

764
00:34:21,643 --> 00:34:23,242
and then you came around.

765
00:34:23,312 --> 00:34:24,544
No, I didn't "come around."

766
00:34:24,613 --> 00:34:26,407
I'm Sofia's mother. I
legally adopted her.

767
00:34:26,431 --> 00:34:29,210
Mmm, she doesn't want
to go there. No, she doesn't.

768
00:34:29,234 --> 00:34:31,168
Her last names are
Sloan and Torres.

769
00:34:31,236 --> 00:34:32,796
I'm gonna have to stop
you before you continue

770
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,721
for your own sake.

771
00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:36,351
You're not going to imply
that I'm any less Sofia's mother

772
00:34:36,375 --> 00:34:38,269
because we don't
share the same DNA.

773
00:34:38,293 --> 00:34:39,603
Dr. Robbins, excuse me.

774
00:34:39,627 --> 00:34:40,821
Because that would be offensive.

775
00:34:40,845 --> 00:34:42,090
It would be offensive
to anyone in the room

776
00:34:42,114 --> 00:34:43,596
who has an adopted child

777
00:34:43,665 --> 00:34:45,693
or is an adopted child,
and for you to say that...

778
00:34:45,717 --> 00:34:48,951
Dr. Robbins... I chose
to be Sofia's mother!

779
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:52,756
It did not fall into my lap.

780
00:34:52,824 --> 00:34:55,558
There was a choice, and
I could stay or I could run,

781
00:34:55,627 --> 00:34:58,428
and I chose motherhood.

782
00:34:58,497 --> 00:35:00,430
And it was the best
choice that I ever made.

783
00:35:03,017 --> 00:35:04,651
I'm so sorry.

784
00:35:04,719 --> 00:35:06,464
I'm a doctor, and I have
to answer my phone,

785
00:35:06,488 --> 00:35:08,171
so I'm sorry.

786
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,073
I'm so sorry.

787
00:35:13,678 --> 00:35:15,044
Thank you.

788
00:35:19,368 --> 00:35:21,208
Somewhere more important to be?

789
00:35:22,987 --> 00:35:25,171
Actually, yes. Excuse me?

790
00:35:26,091 --> 00:35:27,807
I'm sorry.

791
00:35:27,876 --> 00:35:29,442
I'm so sorry.

792
00:35:44,459 --> 00:35:46,426
I love my child,

793
00:35:47,863 --> 00:35:49,062
and I want her with me,

794
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:51,565
but I know that, no
matter how this ends,

795
00:35:53,134 --> 00:35:54,701
she'll survive.

796
00:35:56,638 --> 00:36:00,139
She'll be healthy and safe

797
00:36:00,208 --> 00:36:02,108
and well-taken
care of and loved.

798
00:36:02,177 --> 00:36:03,777
Because...

799
00:36:06,014 --> 00:36:07,480
We are her mothers.

800
00:36:13,989 --> 00:36:17,056
But there's a child at the
hospital who will not survive

801
00:36:17,125 --> 00:36:21,293
unless I am there,
so I have to...

802
00:36:21,362 --> 00:36:23,312
I have to... I have to go.

803
00:36:46,637 --> 00:36:48,838
I am through the uterine wall.

804
00:36:48,907 --> 00:36:50,273
More suction, please.

805
00:36:50,342 --> 00:36:52,202
Vitals are holding.

806
00:36:52,226 --> 00:36:53,954
Why isn't he stopping?
Did you ask him to stop?

807
00:36:53,978 --> 00:36:55,490
Yes. But he's insisting
on taking the baby out.

808
00:36:55,514 --> 00:36:56,975
Is he into the uterus? - Yes.

809
00:36:56,999 --> 00:36:58,493
Well, did he cut the
cord? No, but he's close.

810
00:36:58,517 --> 00:36:59,894
Tell him not to. Damn it!

811
00:36:59,918 --> 00:37:00,950
I did.

812
00:37:04,156 --> 00:37:07,023
Okay, everyone. Change of plans.

813
00:37:07,092 --> 00:37:08,552
Dr. Russo, please
stop what you're doing.

814
00:37:08,576 --> 00:37:10,304
- Excuse me?
- Hi, Tara. Hi, Jenny.

815
00:37:10,328 --> 00:37:12,311
You're doing great,
okay? Hey, Karev.

816
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:13,758
- Cord's intact.
- Beautiful.

817
00:37:13,782 --> 00:37:15,226
Dr. Russo. I said
stop. Now, please.

818
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:17,412
Robbins, I've almost
completed the C-section.

819
00:37:17,436 --> 00:37:18,830
But you won't be finishing it.

820
00:37:18,854 --> 00:37:21,104
Someone tell me
what's going on right now.

821
00:37:21,172 --> 00:37:23,600
Um, Tara and Jenny, I am
going to put that baby back in there

822
00:37:23,624 --> 00:37:25,058
so it can cook
a little bit more.

823
00:37:25,126 --> 00:37:26,737
- How's that sound to you?
- You can do that?

824
00:37:26,761 --> 00:37:28,640
- It's not too late?
- It is too late.

825
00:37:28,664 --> 00:37:30,808
She's already lost most
of the amniotic fluid.

826
00:37:30,832 --> 00:37:32,532
There's not enough left.

827
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,295
I'm going to fill the depleted
uterus with Lactated Ringer's,

828
00:37:34,319 --> 00:37:36,097
and the baby's gonna be fine.

829
00:37:36,121 --> 00:37:37,431
- Warren, how's she doing?
- Pressure's holding steady,

830
00:37:37,455 --> 00:37:38,682
but we should hurry.

831
00:37:38,706 --> 00:37:39,946
Okay. Mom, I need your consent.

832
00:37:41,242 --> 00:37:42,837
Dr. Robbins can give
the baby more time.

833
00:37:42,861 --> 00:37:44,738
Every additional week
this baby stays inside,

834
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:46,682
the better the
chances of its survival.

835
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:50,216
Mom?

836
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:56,956
We trust Dr. Robbins.

837
00:37:57,025 --> 00:37:58,736
Okay. Uh, Dr. Russo,
thank you for your help.

838
00:37:58,760 --> 00:37:59,809
Please scrub out.

839
00:37:59,878 --> 00:38:01,310
Unbelievable.

840
00:38:01,379 --> 00:38:02,795
Okay, Jenny.

841
00:38:02,864 --> 00:38:03,958
We're gonna put you
out for now, all right?

842
00:38:03,982 --> 00:38:06,115
Tara, you want to say
hi to your grandbaby?

843
00:38:11,606 --> 00:38:12,772
What is it?

844
00:38:12,841 --> 00:38:14,874
It's a girl. You
have a daughter.

845
00:38:14,943 --> 00:38:17,043
Is she pretty? She's beautiful.

846
00:38:17,129 --> 00:38:19,169
She looks just like you did.

847
00:38:20,749 --> 00:38:22,665
Okay. We need to say
goodbye to her now.

848
00:38:22,734 --> 00:38:25,034
Goodbye for now.

849
00:38:25,103 --> 00:38:27,423
Goodbye, little girl.

850
00:38:53,699 --> 00:38:55,927
No matter what
the judge decides,

851
00:38:55,951 --> 00:38:57,661
I know that you're
a good mom, too.

852
00:38:57,685 --> 00:39:00,186
And I just want you to know
this doesn't change that.

853
00:39:07,245 --> 00:39:10,146
The things that you
let them say about me...

854
00:39:11,583 --> 00:39:14,417
I would never have
done that to you.

855
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:16,719
Never.

856
00:39:19,574 --> 00:39:21,934
I'm sorry. The judge
is ready for you.

857
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:28,160
<i>All rise and come to order.</i>

858
00:39:28,215 --> 00:39:30,850
Honorable Judge
Madeline Kane presiding.

859
00:39:35,924 --> 00:39:37,604
Please be seated.

860
00:39:39,177 --> 00:39:41,578
I've taken all testimony

861
00:39:41,646 --> 00:39:44,697
and evidence in this
matter under submission.

862
00:39:44,766 --> 00:39:48,751
And after careful consideration,
my ruling is as follows.

863
00:39:48,819 --> 00:39:51,137
I hereby grant sole
physical custody

864
00:39:51,206 --> 00:39:53,840
of Sofia Robbin
Sloan Torres to...

865
00:39:57,645 --> 00:40:00,713
Oh, have you heard
anything? No, not yet.

866
00:40:00,782 --> 00:40:03,148
Robbins said she'd text as
soon as the judge decided.

867
00:40:03,217 --> 00:40:05,284
Torres, too. This sucks.

868
00:40:17,315 --> 00:40:18,681
What the hell?

869
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:23,620
Give him a stat
CT with contrast.

870
00:40:24,956 --> 00:40:26,434
What happened?
Why wasn't I paged?

871
00:40:26,458 --> 00:40:27,590
Why would you care?

872
00:40:27,659 --> 00:40:29,926
He passed out.
Possible meningitis.

873
00:40:29,994 --> 00:40:32,512
She's not my doctor.
I don't want her here.

874
00:40:32,597 --> 00:40:33,746
Get her out of here.

875
00:40:33,815 --> 00:40:35,047
Wilson.

876
00:40:36,451 --> 00:40:37,950
No, don't. I'm...

877
00:40:38,019 --> 00:40:39,785
I'm going.

878
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:41,220
I'm going.

879
00:40:48,546 --> 00:40:51,648
<i>If you're wondering how
the Solomon story ends...</i>

880
00:40:51,716 --> 00:40:53,427
Did you get all your
things from upstairs, Sofia?

881
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:54,695
Your books and everything?

882
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:56,152
<i>Spoiler alert...</i>

883
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:58,165
<i>The true mom would
rather give her baby up</i>

884
00:40:58,189 --> 00:41:00,029
<i>than have it ripped in two.</i>

885
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:02,925
Hi, sweetie.

886
00:41:02,994 --> 00:41:05,895
<i>But what happens when
there are two true mothers?</i>

887
00:41:17,842 --> 00:41:20,162
How the hell did this happen?

888
00:41:22,764 --> 00:41:24,197
How?

889
00:41:24,266 --> 00:41:26,586
How the hell did this happen?

890
00:41:38,446 --> 00:41:40,530
<i>That's a no-win situation.</i>

891
00:41:56,231 --> 00:41:57,247
Mommy.

892
00:41:59,734 --> 00:42:02,135
Can we go home now?

893
00:42:02,203 --> 00:42:04,336
Yeah. We sure can.

894
00:42:08,310 --> 00:42:10,059
Let's go home.

895
00:42:10,127 --> 00:42:13,229
<i>That is an entirely
different story.</i>
