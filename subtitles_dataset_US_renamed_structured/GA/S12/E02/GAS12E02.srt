1
00:00:03,871 --> 00:00:05,382
The body has approximately
11 organ systems,

2
00:00:05,406 --> 00:00:08,407
all doing different
things at the same time.

3
00:00:08,476 --> 00:00:12,828
In order to keep us
functioning, or, well, alive,

4
00:00:12,896 --> 00:00:16,865
<i>they need one voice,
a leader, a master.</i>

5
00:00:16,934 --> 00:00:20,886
And in our brains, that job
belongs to the pituitary gland.

6
00:00:20,954 --> 00:00:24,139
<i>It senses the body's needs
before they even arise,</i>

7
00:00:24,208 --> 00:00:25,991
<i>working nonstop.</i>

8
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:28,827
The pituitary gland communicates
with all of the other glands,

9
00:00:28,896 --> 00:00:30,946
telling them when to produce

10
00:00:31,014 --> 00:00:33,243
the vital hormones
we need to function.

11
00:00:33,267 --> 00:00:37,286
<i>It keeps everything running
smoothly, in perfect order.</i>

12
00:00:37,354 --> 00:00:39,114
You want a muffin? No, no.

13
00:00:39,156 --> 00:00:40,300
You sure? Go, go.

14
00:00:40,324 --> 00:00:42,441
There's no denying it,

15
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:45,344
it has the toughest
job in the place.

16
00:00:53,954 --> 00:00:55,065
Are you nervous?

17
00:00:55,089 --> 00:00:56,329
You're not nervous.

18
00:00:56,373 --> 00:00:57,823
Of course I'm nervous.

19
00:00:57,892 --> 00:01:00,392
Been waiting for this
day my entire career,

20
00:01:00,461 --> 00:01:04,295
and I promised them
candy disco rainbows.

21
00:01:04,364 --> 00:01:05,663
And now I have to deliver.

22
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:06,998
Am I nervous?

23
00:01:08,836 --> 00:01:10,435
You will deliver.

24
00:01:10,503 --> 00:01:14,572
I just need it to be
perfect. Just today.

25
00:01:17,394 --> 00:01:20,045
Oh, no, no. Go on. You
can't be late for rounds.

26
00:01:20,113 --> 00:01:22,392
People will think I'm
giving you special treatment.

27
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:24,143
Go on. Okay.

28
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:25,617
No special treatment!

29
00:01:27,771 --> 00:01:28,881
Okay.

30
00:01:28,905 --> 00:01:31,239
I'll see you later... Chief.

31
00:01:33,827 --> 00:01:35,210
Thanks.

32
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:48,273
This can't be right.
They live here?

33
00:01:48,342 --> 00:01:50,520
I mean, when you said carpool,
I thought you meant just us.

34
00:01:50,544 --> 00:01:51,960
Where is Alex?

35
00:01:52,029 --> 00:01:53,907
Are Owen and I going out
and I didn't even realize it?

36
00:01:53,931 --> 00:01:55,958
Does that happen?
Do adults even do that?

37
00:01:55,982 --> 00:01:57,499
I don't know. Stop asking.

38
00:01:57,568 --> 00:01:59,262
Carpooling is
supposed to save time.

39
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:01,019
This guy with the beard...

40
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:02,632
I have seen him perform
a sex act to buy drugs,

41
00:02:02,656 --> 00:02:04,406
take the drugs, and fall asleep.

42
00:02:04,474 --> 00:02:05,857
He's had a full day already.

43
00:02:05,925 --> 00:02:07,103
And yet we're still here.

44
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:08,204
At least I think he's asleep.

45
00:02:08,228 --> 00:02:09,594
Adults go home together.

46
00:02:09,663 --> 00:02:12,023
They don't go out.
They don't go steady.

47
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:13,281
We're not 15.

48
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:14,478
You made out with
him on our front porch.

49
00:02:14,502 --> 00:02:15,745
And I have no idea
what that means.

50
00:02:15,769 --> 00:02:17,463
I thought we were
friends. What does it mean?

51
00:02:17,487 --> 00:02:18,787
You sound 15.

52
00:02:18,855 --> 00:02:20,122
Boo!

53
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:21,834
Alex! I've been sitting
out here 20 minutes.

54
00:02:21,858 --> 00:02:24,358
Well, yell at Jo for not
changing her oil in over a decade.

55
00:02:24,427 --> 00:02:26,406
Between you and this anatomy
class, my morning is shot.

56
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:28,325
I need to stop teaching
this anatomy class.

57
00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:29,647
Your neighbors seem nice.

58
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:31,378
Yeah, the block's
a pit, but it's cheap.

59
00:02:31,402 --> 00:02:32,768
Everybody buckled?

60
00:02:34,171 --> 00:02:35,937
Webber needs one of us

61
00:02:36,006 --> 00:02:38,706
to walk Bailey into her surprise
breakfast thing this morning.

62
00:02:38,776 --> 00:02:40,708
No, thanks. Not I.

63
00:02:40,778 --> 00:02:42,077
I hate all of you.

64
00:02:51,121 --> 00:02:52,121
Chief.

65
00:02:52,189 --> 00:02:54,056
Happy first day. Thank you.

66
00:02:54,124 --> 00:02:56,324
I need to thank you for
giving me this class to teach.

67
00:02:56,393 --> 00:02:59,127
It was very generous. I
love shaping young minds.

68
00:02:59,196 --> 00:03:00,695
You're welcome.

69
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:01,863
I need to give it back.

70
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:03,231
Not possible.

71
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,444
Oh! I need you to
handle Miss O'Neil's

72
00:03:05,468 --> 00:03:06,762
J-tube replacement this morning.

73
00:03:06,786 --> 00:03:07,919
Thank you.

74
00:03:07,988 --> 00:03:09,366
It's just a lot more
work than I expected,

75
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:10,967
and with three children
and my patients...

76
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:12,502
And, also, find someone to cover

77
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:14,004
the bariatric clinic
this afternoon.

78
00:03:14,028 --> 00:03:15,860
And my surgeries,
which actually makes

79
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:18,063
finding time to prep
for the class impossible.

80
00:03:18,132 --> 00:03:19,809
Look, I'm asking
you to do this stuff,

81
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:21,444
so do it. Anything else to say?

82
00:03:21,468 --> 00:03:22,879
We're late for the
attendings' meeting.

83
00:03:22,903 --> 00:03:24,436
The...

84
00:03:24,505 --> 00:03:26,988
Attendings' meeting? Did
no one read my e-mail?

85
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:33,311
I think... I mean, I just...

86
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,808
I barely know this woman. We
had, like, two dates last week.

87
00:03:35,832 --> 00:03:37,126
She asked to see
me again tonight.

88
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,613
It's crazy. I can't stop
thinking about her.

89
00:03:39,637 --> 00:03:44,373
You know when you meet someone
and you get that flutter, that rush,

90
00:03:44,441 --> 00:03:47,770
and it feels like you know
them and they know you

91
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:49,428
and you think to yourself,

92
00:03:49,496 --> 00:03:52,014
"I could stare at this
person's face forever"?

93
00:03:52,082 --> 00:03:53,493
Do you know what I
mean? Or maybe not.

94
00:03:53,517 --> 00:03:55,812
So, I looked it up,
and Bailey's the first.

95
00:03:55,836 --> 00:03:57,035
First what?

96
00:03:57,104 --> 00:03:58,547
First female chief of
surgery of this hospital.

97
00:03:58,571 --> 00:03:59,771
Before that, all men.

98
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:01,189
I say it's about time.

99
00:04:01,258 --> 00:04:04,192
And all the department chiefs
are women. Neuro, cardio...

100
00:04:04,278 --> 00:04:05,710
We got trauma. Ortho.

101
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:06,856
Let it go. AMELIA: Fetal.

102
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,197
Badass! Ladies.

103
00:04:09,265 --> 00:04:12,317
This place is run by
ladies. It's "ladyplace."

104
00:04:12,369 --> 00:04:14,063
No. It is not ladyplace.

105
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:16,047
"Ladyplace" is what my
grandma calls her vagina.

106
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:19,307
To anyone who will listen,
by the way, she is not shy.

107
00:04:19,376 --> 00:04:21,070
No, we can't call
this place ladyplace.

108
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:25,213
I don't need to think of that sweet,
sweet, raunchy, old lady's vag

109
00:04:25,282 --> 00:04:26,776
every time I walk
through the doors.

110
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,678
Me neither, but I will now.

111
00:04:28,702 --> 00:04:29,980
She's coming,
she's coming! Okay?

112
00:04:30,004 --> 00:04:31,136
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

113
00:04:37,661 --> 00:04:39,605
Well, I'm glad to
see you're all here.

114
00:04:39,629 --> 00:04:41,508
But if you had read your e-mail,

115
00:04:41,532 --> 00:04:43,492
you would have known
that one of the many things

116
00:04:43,534 --> 00:04:45,317
that I will be
implementing as chief

117
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:47,619
is no more weekly
attendings' meetings.

118
00:04:47,688 --> 00:04:49,403
Well, actually, this is a...

119
00:04:49,472 --> 00:04:53,108
See, less talking about saving
lives and more saving of the lives.

120
00:04:53,643 --> 00:04:54,693
Thank you.

121
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:56,445
Okay, but... No.

122
00:04:58,315 --> 00:04:59,381
Wait.

123
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:08,623
Hey, did I miss Bailey's party?

124
00:05:08,692 --> 00:05:10,725
It wasn't a party.

125
00:05:10,794 --> 00:05:12,138
I couldn't stop sleeping.

126
00:05:12,162 --> 00:05:14,195
I think I'm fighting off a cold

127
00:05:14,264 --> 00:05:16,231
or it's jet lag or just
sleeping in a bed.

128
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,066
Down comforter
works like morphine.

129
00:05:18,135 --> 00:05:19,617
Did you talk to Jackson yet?

130
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:21,386
He slept here last night.

131
00:05:21,455 --> 00:05:24,155
God, so you actually
are... What the hell is that?

132
00:05:24,224 --> 00:05:25,651
What? What? What? On your back!

133
00:05:25,675 --> 00:05:27,743
What's on my back? Do I
have a mole or something?

134
00:05:28,862 --> 00:05:29,894
What...

135
00:05:30,614 --> 00:05:31,713
What?

136
00:05:33,032 --> 00:05:34,515
Arizona!

137
00:05:34,585 --> 00:05:38,119
I have a rash.
It's a stupid rash.

138
00:05:38,188 --> 00:05:40,154
You are completely overreacting.

139
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:41,740
I'm sorry. I work with babies.

140
00:05:41,808 --> 00:05:44,659
Kepner, you've got
lesions, a cough, a fever.

141
00:05:44,728 --> 00:05:45,872
You were in the Middle East.

142
00:05:45,896 --> 00:05:48,463
I was traveling. I am run-down.

143
00:05:48,532 --> 00:05:50,265
You can be run-down
in the bubble.

144
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:52,050
Look, we don't
know what you have.

145
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:53,813
We don't know how
contagious you are.

146
00:05:53,837 --> 00:05:55,565
Hey, this is my first
day running this place.

147
00:05:55,589 --> 00:05:58,322
There will be no
epidemics today.

148
00:05:58,392 --> 00:05:59,974
What did infectious disease say?

149
00:06:00,043 --> 00:06:02,911
Well, as of now, her
symptoms are nonspecific,

150
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,323
but they want to
rule out anthrax.

151
00:06:04,347 --> 00:06:05,897
Any concerns about MERS?

152
00:06:05,965 --> 00:06:07,499
Oh, God. You think?

153
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:09,100
I'm right here.

154
00:06:09,168 --> 00:06:11,837
And you will stay right there
until your tests come back.

155
00:06:11,905 --> 00:06:13,888
This stops with patient zero.

156
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:17,275
I am not patient zero.
I'm not a patient at all.

157
00:06:17,327 --> 00:06:18,927
Goodbye, Kepner.

158
00:06:18,995 --> 00:06:21,274
Do not cross that
line. Stay in the bubble.

159
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:22,530
I cannot...

160
00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:23,765
In the bubble.

161
00:06:24,601 --> 00:06:25,951
I will visit you, I promise.

162
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:34,642
May I see it, the rash?

163
00:06:44,922 --> 00:06:47,322
It's nothing, right?

164
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:49,224
I'll keep my eye
out for your labs.

165
00:06:49,293 --> 00:06:50,391
Okay.

166
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:53,161
But maybe we can talk if...

167
00:06:58,201 --> 00:06:59,379
Look, I'm saying we
should page neuro.

168
00:06:59,403 --> 00:07:00,502
Why?

169
00:07:00,571 --> 00:07:02,415
Her vitals are stable,
her bloodwork's normal,

170
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:04,450
we sewed up her head
lac, she's obviously fine.

171
00:07:04,474 --> 00:07:05,607
Fine, you discharge her.

172
00:07:05,676 --> 00:07:07,342
Discharge who? Hi, Chief.

173
00:07:07,411 --> 00:07:08,476
Her.

174
00:07:14,518 --> 00:07:16,251
Uh...

175
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,720
"Jade Bell." Hello.
I'm Dr. Bailey.

176
00:07:18,788 --> 00:07:20,488
Oh, good. More doctors.

177
00:07:20,557 --> 00:07:22,719
The patient complained of
a headache and blurry vision

178
00:07:22,743 --> 00:07:24,120
before she fainted
and hit her head,

179
00:07:24,144 --> 00:07:26,489
so I did a complete syncope
work-up, which was negative.

180
00:07:26,513 --> 00:07:28,579
So what? That led you to...

181
00:07:28,649 --> 00:07:29,726
Sew up her head lac.

182
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,599
What is her diagnosis?

183
00:07:31,667 --> 00:07:33,312
Hypoglycemia? She probably
just forgot to eat breakfast?

184
00:07:33,336 --> 00:07:35,270
Wrong. You, what
did this one miss?

185
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:37,906
Beta hCG. Could you be pregnant?

186
00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:39,174
Not a chance.

187
00:07:39,242 --> 00:07:40,953
Look, I was in a
meeting, I felt dizzy,

188
00:07:40,977 --> 00:07:42,588
and I woke up here,
but I feel fine now.

189
00:07:42,612 --> 00:07:44,190
Can I go? No, you cannot.

190
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:46,164
What are you missing?

191
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:49,512
Migraine variant.
Autonomic dysfunction.

192
00:07:49,536 --> 00:07:52,671
This is really, really fun, but
I have a work deadline so...

193
00:07:52,739 --> 00:07:54,139
Jade, stand up for me, please.

194
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:55,740
What? Stand up, please.

195
00:07:58,278 --> 00:07:59,561
We didn't miss anything.

196
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,820
Hi. Freak show's over. Can I go?

197
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:10,689
Whoa!

198
00:08:10,757 --> 00:08:12,774
That is what you missed.

199
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:29,757
I feel naked.

200
00:08:29,826 --> 00:08:32,444
That nurse Betsy...
Her name was Betsy...

201
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,262
She took my clothes, took them,

202
00:08:34,331 --> 00:08:35,463
sealed them in plastic.

203
00:08:35,531 --> 00:08:37,299
She took all of my clothes.

204
00:08:37,384 --> 00:08:39,317
I have on paper panties!

205
00:08:39,386 --> 00:08:40,785
You know how paper panties feel?

206
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:42,699
I imagine that
there's some chafing.

207
00:08:43,824 --> 00:08:45,089
Okay.

208
00:08:45,158 --> 00:08:46,885
Listen, it's a chance to relax,

209
00:08:46,909 --> 00:08:48,509
so you should take a nap

210
00:08:48,578 --> 00:08:50,290
and get rid of
your jet lag or read.

211
00:08:50,314 --> 00:08:51,946
It's like a spa or a vacation.

212
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:55,333
I am in a bubble! I
am trapped in a bubble!

213
00:08:55,402 --> 00:08:57,235
Jackson, he came in once.

214
00:08:57,304 --> 00:08:59,337
He came in once,
took a look at me,

215
00:08:59,406 --> 00:09:00,449
and then just walked away,

216
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:02,106
and I couldn't go
after him because

217
00:09:02,175 --> 00:09:03,357
the bubble does not travel.

218
00:09:03,443 --> 00:09:05,110
No, it does not.

219
00:09:05,178 --> 00:09:06,778
I am alone in here.

220
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:10,982
I am trapped like a bug,
like some kind of nasty bug,

221
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:13,368
and I'm covered in disease.

222
00:09:13,436 --> 00:09:15,519
You would think that he
would want to talk to me.

223
00:09:15,589 --> 00:09:18,205
I am gonna die of a
mysterious disease

224
00:09:18,274 --> 00:09:21,475
with a chafed,
buggy ass all alone!

225
00:09:21,544 --> 00:09:23,311
Oh! Oh, my God. Don't freak out.

226
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:25,257
You've been in here
for, like, an hour.

227
00:09:25,281 --> 00:09:26,997
It's not that. It's Jackson.

228
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:33,538
How can I help?

229
00:09:34,457 --> 00:09:36,324
Um... Just talk.

230
00:09:36,393 --> 00:09:39,878
Talk about something
else. Anything.

231
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:41,579
Okay. Um... Okay.

232
00:09:42,783 --> 00:09:44,916
Oh! Here's a thing. Um...

233
00:09:44,985 --> 00:09:47,185
Callie met someone.

234
00:09:48,872 --> 00:09:51,305
Oh! Um...

235
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:53,441
So, are you okay
with that, or...

236
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,009
Yeah, super. Awesome.

237
00:09:55,078 --> 00:09:56,561
Okay, that's great, then.

238
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:58,191
Yeah, I mean, I should
be happy for her, right?

239
00:09:58,215 --> 00:09:59,792
And she sounds happy, you know,

240
00:09:59,816 --> 00:10:01,911
happier than she's
ever been, she says.

241
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:04,719
I mean, apparently,
like, forever happy.

242
00:10:04,787 --> 00:10:06,254
Do we have to talk about this?

243
00:10:06,323 --> 00:10:07,900
Well, you know, she does, 'cause

244
00:10:07,924 --> 00:10:10,284
she's talking to
everybody about it.

245
00:10:11,761 --> 00:10:13,461
I'm surprised she fit.

246
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:15,530
20 bucks she's over 7 feet.

247
00:10:15,598 --> 00:10:16,831
I mean, is it drugs

248
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,478
or the wrong combo
of steroids, you think?

249
00:10:18,502 --> 00:10:19,712
I saw LeBron at an airport once.

250
00:10:19,736 --> 00:10:20,785
She's taller than him.

251
00:10:20,854 --> 00:10:22,386
Be quiet and stand outside.

252
00:10:25,892 --> 00:10:27,859
Do we think it's drugs?

253
00:10:27,928 --> 00:10:29,694
A growth hormone, maybe?

254
00:10:29,763 --> 00:10:31,663
It's definitely not drugs.

255
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:33,364
Waiting for a
scan to confirm it.

256
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:35,633
Yeah, I'm right. You'll see.

257
00:10:35,702 --> 00:10:38,652
And just 'cause you're chief
now, you're knower of all things?

258
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:43,174
Look, Jade suffers from blurry
vision, headaches, dizziness.

259
00:10:43,243 --> 00:10:44,359
Abnormal growth.

260
00:10:44,427 --> 00:10:46,027
Okay, put it all
together, and you get...

261
00:10:47,964 --> 00:10:49,947
A pituitary tumor.

262
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:52,750
The knower of all things!

263
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:54,368
I should be chief of surgery.

264
00:10:54,437 --> 00:10:56,153
Oh, wait. I already am.

265
00:10:57,924 --> 00:10:59,524
You are welcome.

266
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:05,830
Where have you been?

267
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:07,899
I was downloading all
the charts you asked for,

268
00:11:07,934 --> 00:11:09,962
which, respectfully,
is a lot of charts.

269
00:11:09,986 --> 00:11:12,066
Are we really doing all
of these surgeries today?

270
00:11:12,122 --> 00:11:14,021
Well, Bailey pushed
all her patients onto me,

271
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,723
so that means you, too.

272
00:11:15,792 --> 00:11:17,725
Kyle Roane. Can we
push this lap chole...

273
00:11:17,794 --> 00:11:19,805
No, we don't have
his liver tests back yet.

274
00:11:19,829 --> 00:11:21,195
What about Dana Lee?

275
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:22,692
Hernia repair. Do we have
the urinalysis, because...

276
00:11:22,716 --> 00:11:23,956
No, the labs are backed up.

277
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:25,149
I don't have time for this.

278
00:11:26,553 --> 00:11:28,219
Is there anything I can do

279
00:11:28,287 --> 00:11:30,254
to make your day
better, Dr. Grey?

280
00:11:30,323 --> 00:11:32,123
I'm sorry. I just...

281
00:11:33,493 --> 00:11:35,860
I can't say no to Bailey
because it's for the chief,

282
00:11:35,929 --> 00:11:38,263
so I just need a little
break in the clouds here.

283
00:11:38,331 --> 00:11:40,565
I just need a little rain.

284
00:11:42,836 --> 00:11:45,035
I appreciate the apology.

285
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:48,246
Where are you going?

286
00:11:49,226 --> 00:11:50,592
To make it rain.

287
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:55,030
Thanks.

288
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:57,198
Walk-ins.

289
00:11:59,002 --> 00:12:01,369
Dr. Wilson. You paged?

290
00:12:01,438 --> 00:12:02,603
No, I didn't.

291
00:12:02,672 --> 00:12:03,950
Oh! Wow, that's weird.
Totally thought you did.

292
00:12:03,974 --> 00:12:05,106
Maybe this thing is old.

293
00:12:05,175 --> 00:12:06,552
Anyway, you
waiting for your labs?

294
00:12:06,576 --> 00:12:07,576
Can I... Can I wait...

295
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:08,927
Oh! Thank you, yeah.

296
00:12:08,995 --> 00:12:10,072
Bring me the labs
when you get them.

297
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:12,614
No, no, I meant wait with you.

298
00:12:12,682 --> 00:12:14,482
Oh! Why?

299
00:12:14,551 --> 00:12:16,228
I need to rush a
patient's pre-op.

300
00:12:16,252 --> 00:12:19,086
I've been waiting 10 minutes.
Apparently, the system's down.

301
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:21,350
Grey tasked me with all of
these labs and these extra rounds,

302
00:12:21,374 --> 00:12:23,286
and I need to prep
three patients for the OR.

303
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:25,877
So, I... This isn't
gonna work for me.

304
00:12:26,762 --> 00:12:27,779
What are you...

305
00:12:27,831 --> 00:12:28,874
Excuse me. - Hey!

306
00:12:28,898 --> 00:12:31,243
Hi. I need the labs
for Dana Lee, stat.

307
00:12:31,267 --> 00:12:32,678
- It's... It's for the chief.
- Excuse me!

308
00:12:32,702 --> 00:12:34,085
Oh, no, she didn't!

309
00:12:34,154 --> 00:12:36,048
We're all waiting in line here.

310
00:12:36,072 --> 00:12:37,772
Thank you so much.

311
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:39,106
Oh!

312
00:12:39,943 --> 00:12:41,642
Bring me those labs.

313
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,563
Can't wait.

314
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:47,548
How you doing?

315
00:12:47,617 --> 00:12:48,849
Oh, uh... Hi, Bailey.

316
00:12:48,918 --> 00:12:51,219
Or should I say "Chief"?

317
00:12:51,287 --> 00:12:52,764
Yes, sir. Okay.

318
00:12:52,788 --> 00:12:54,422
I just heard about the case.

319
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:57,091
A big patient for
a big first day?

320
00:12:57,159 --> 00:12:59,376
Yes, sir.

321
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:02,313
And do you want anything,
a consult, anything?

322
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:03,831
Oh, no, no. I got it covered.

323
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,065
Thanks, though.

324
00:13:29,075 --> 00:13:30,820
Prelim results says
it's definitely not

325
00:13:30,844 --> 00:13:32,655
Middle East
respiratory syndrome.

326
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:33,811
So can I get out of here?

327
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,308
Well, they won't
clear you to leave

328
00:13:35,332 --> 00:13:37,276
until they get your
Gram stain results.

329
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,799
Jackson.

330
00:13:38,868 --> 00:13:40,418
I've been gone for three months.

331
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:41,986
Can we at least
have a conversation?

332
00:13:45,058 --> 00:13:47,274
I have a consult.

333
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,655
I'll let you know when I get
your Gram stain results back.

334
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:50,911
Wait, wait!

335
00:13:52,065 --> 00:13:53,164
Come on!

336
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:59,086
Okay. So, Jade, you
have two problems.

337
00:13:59,155 --> 00:14:02,123
In addition to the
pituitary tumor there,

338
00:14:02,191 --> 00:14:05,960
the fall you took caused a
fracture in one of your vertebrae,

339
00:14:06,029 --> 00:14:07,228
so you will need surgery.

340
00:14:07,297 --> 00:14:09,524
But more importantly, I
need to remove the tumor

341
00:14:09,548 --> 00:14:10,659
as soon as possible. No, no.

342
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:11,923
No one cuts into my brain.

343
00:14:11,985 --> 00:14:13,225
Look, I'm missing work.

344
00:14:13,286 --> 00:14:16,387
Jade, this tumor is causing
your growth hormones

345
00:14:16,455 --> 00:14:19,106
to be 16 times
higher than normal,

346
00:14:19,175 --> 00:14:21,342
which means that you'll
only continue to grow.

347
00:14:21,411 --> 00:14:23,944
I've been 6'6" since I
was 17. Who cares?

348
00:14:24,013 --> 00:14:25,496
Actually, you're 7'2".

349
00:14:25,565 --> 00:14:27,014
And a quarter, we measured.

350
00:14:27,082 --> 00:14:29,584
You're growing at a rate faster
than your body can handle.

351
00:14:29,652 --> 00:14:31,480
Any more force, and
your spine will collapse.

352
00:14:31,504 --> 00:14:33,988
Well, how long
will surgery take?

353
00:14:34,056 --> 00:14:36,824
Making a surgical plan,
the surgery and recovery,

354
00:14:36,893 --> 00:14:39,043
we can get you back
to work in a week or so.

355
00:14:39,112 --> 00:14:40,895
Nope. Look, I'll come back when,

356
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:42,697
you know, my
work project is over.

357
00:14:42,766 --> 00:14:44,799
Sit.

358
00:14:44,867 --> 00:14:47,618
Chief, I need to do a repeat
neuro check in four hours.

359
00:14:47,671 --> 00:14:49,470
Four hours? No, I can't.

360
00:14:49,539 --> 00:14:51,989
I know your work is important,

361
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:55,359
but this brain surgery
has to be your priority.

362
00:14:55,428 --> 00:14:56,539
Really? Do you know what I do?

363
00:14:56,563 --> 00:14:57,563
No.

364
00:14:57,613 --> 00:14:59,091
I lead a team that's
bringing the Internet

365
00:14:59,115 --> 00:15:00,826
to the parts of Africa
that don't have it.

366
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:02,884
The Internet is
man getting fire.

367
00:15:02,969 --> 00:15:04,903
This is the
21st-century light bulb.

368
00:15:04,971 --> 00:15:08,055
Do you know how many
lives will be changed, be saved,

369
00:15:08,124 --> 00:15:09,885
how many girls will
become educated?

370
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:12,009
Do you know how
much medical knowledge,

371
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:14,118
how much information
will become available

372
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,992
to people who've
been kept in the dark?

373
00:15:16,016 --> 00:15:19,300
This project goes live in one
week, and I need to be there.

374
00:15:19,368 --> 00:15:20,868
I have to be.

375
00:15:20,937 --> 00:15:22,436
Yeah, that's...

376
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:25,256
More important
than brain surgery.

377
00:15:25,325 --> 00:15:27,358
Jade, I hear you.

378
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:30,578
You have the weight of
the world on your shoulders.

379
00:15:30,647 --> 00:15:34,364
But believe me when I
tell you I can help you.

380
00:15:34,417 --> 00:15:37,652
Okay, I'll give you the four
hours. Then I'm leaving.

381
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:42,357
Four hours?

382
00:15:42,425 --> 00:15:44,853
And in that time frame, I
need a complete surgical plan

383
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:47,127
for resection of
the pituitary tumor

384
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:49,363
and repair of
the spinal fracture

385
00:15:49,432 --> 00:15:52,600
that includes a recovery
time of no more than a week.

386
00:15:52,668 --> 00:15:55,620
Oh! Okay, well, you know what? I
have a knee replacement right now.

387
00:15:55,689 --> 00:15:57,571
I've got a VATS procedure.

388
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,385
Then push that and delegate
that. Now, we have to move fast.

389
00:15:59,409 --> 00:16:02,160
This woman has no
interest in being treated.

390
00:16:02,212 --> 00:16:03,812
You know, in fact,
she's a flight risk.

391
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:06,647
Wilson, you're in charge of
making sure she stays put. Go.

392
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:08,249
Her tumor is massive.

393
00:16:08,318 --> 00:16:10,117
I mean, we need extensive scans

394
00:16:10,186 --> 00:16:12,853
and time to go over an
approach for both procedures.

395
00:16:12,922 --> 00:16:14,922
That takes longer
than four hours.

396
00:16:15,008 --> 00:16:18,120
Well, actually, you have
three hours and 36 minutes.

397
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:19,905
Bailey, we need at least
until the end of the day, okay?

398
00:16:19,929 --> 00:16:21,796
What you're asking
for is impossible.

399
00:16:21,864 --> 00:16:22,996
What? It's what?

400
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:25,060
Oh! I know you
didn't say impossible.

401
00:16:25,084 --> 00:16:27,218
No, nothing's impossible.

402
00:16:27,287 --> 00:16:30,504
You are smart people.

403
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:32,706
You're good surgeons.

404
00:16:32,776 --> 00:16:35,960
This patient has
some big things to do,

405
00:16:36,029 --> 00:16:38,196
and I have every
confidence that you

406
00:16:38,264 --> 00:16:40,392
will figure out how
she can do them.

407
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,576
Bailey. And make it possible.

408
00:16:47,974 --> 00:16:49,640
It's possible, right?

409
00:16:51,077 --> 00:16:52,777
Yeah, it's possible.

410
00:16:58,651 --> 00:17:01,552
It's my victory as
much as it is hers.

411
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,855
I mean, she was my candidate.

412
00:17:03,923 --> 00:17:05,556
I was pulling for her.

413
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:10,244
And so what if I wanted to pass
the torch in a celebratory fashion?

414
00:17:10,313 --> 00:17:12,596
I mean, is that
so terrible? Huh?

415
00:17:12,665 --> 00:17:15,632
Maybe offer a word of
support or advice here or there.

416
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:17,668
I mean, not that she asked me.

417
00:17:17,737 --> 00:17:19,887
She hasn't asked
me for anything.

418
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:23,691
Well, I suppose I could
ask her if she minds if I join...

419
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,927
You know, I shouldn't have to
ask. She should want me there.

420
00:17:26,996 --> 00:17:28,946
I should've been the
first place she stopped.

421
00:17:28,998 --> 00:17:31,599
No, but she's
got it all handled.

422
00:17:33,335 --> 00:17:35,503
And I worry.

423
00:17:35,571 --> 00:17:37,538
It's... It's foolhardy.

424
00:17:37,607 --> 00:17:40,574
You know, it's
arrogance is what it is.

425
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:41,976
And I'm gonna talk to her.

426
00:17:43,329 --> 00:17:45,479
Good talk. Thanks, Kepner.

427
00:17:45,548 --> 00:17:46,780
Feel better.

428
00:17:49,102 --> 00:17:50,346
Can you do a
minimally invasive...

429
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:52,236
No, no, her vertebral
bodies are too large.

430
00:17:52,305 --> 00:17:54,316
We'll have to use an anterior
approach through the chest.

431
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:55,539
I'll do a right thoracotomy.

432
00:17:55,608 --> 00:17:57,141
I'm gonna do a
transcranial approach.

433
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:58,653
Yeah, if Bailey wants
a shorter recovery,

434
00:17:58,677 --> 00:18:00,089
then an endonasal
approach will help.

435
00:18:00,113 --> 00:18:01,512
Well, the tumor's too big.

436
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,458
The head is abnormally
big. You're gonna have space.

437
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:05,594
I'm doing a craniotomy.
I need visibility.

438
00:18:05,618 --> 00:18:08,397
I'm gonna get you where you need
to be with less bleeding, all right?

439
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:09,486
Just listen for a minute.

440
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:10,599
Apparently, we
don't have a minute.

441
00:18:10,623 --> 00:18:12,690
Avery, can you do a consult?

442
00:18:12,742 --> 00:18:14,525
No.

443
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:16,188
It's for one of Bailey's
patients. Of course it is.

444
00:18:16,212 --> 00:18:18,572
She put all her services on
hold to fix her giant problem.

445
00:18:18,615 --> 00:18:20,615
She had me push
two procedures for this.

446
00:18:20,683 --> 00:18:21,811
She's doing it to you guys, too.

447
00:18:21,835 --> 00:18:23,551
I mean, she postponed
five of my consults

448
00:18:23,619 --> 00:18:25,414
so I could handle her patients.

449
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:27,438
She didn't ask. She
just pushed them.

450
00:18:27,507 --> 00:18:29,873
It's ridiculous. No offense.

451
00:18:29,926 --> 00:18:31,737
- Can she do that?
- Can who do what?

452
00:18:31,761 --> 00:18:34,278
Oh! Can you be chief
again? I loved you as chief.

453
00:18:34,347 --> 00:18:35,829
You did stay out
of people's hair.

454
00:18:35,898 --> 00:18:37,998
Very hands-off and great ties.

455
00:18:38,067 --> 00:18:39,878
You know what they used
to call her, her interns?

456
00:18:39,902 --> 00:18:41,569
What? The Nazi.

457
00:18:41,637 --> 00:18:43,103
Bailey?

458
00:18:43,172 --> 00:18:44,900
Last time she had
absolute rule over people,

459
00:18:44,924 --> 00:18:45,968
and here she is again.

460
00:18:45,992 --> 00:18:47,169
I love Bailey, but...

461
00:18:47,193 --> 00:18:48,304
Power corrupts.

462
00:18:48,328 --> 00:18:49,726
She's an iron-fisted dictator.

463
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:51,178
She's a Bond villain.

464
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:54,815
Warren. I'm so sorry.

465
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:55,961
We weren't trying
to be disrespectful.

466
00:18:55,985 --> 00:18:57,218
It's all good, it's all good.

467
00:18:57,287 --> 00:18:59,403
I'm just gonna go look
into some follow-up scans.

468
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:01,700
Amelia. What do you think?

469
00:19:01,724 --> 00:19:02,990
What? Me?

470
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:05,175
I don't think... Don't ask me.

471
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:07,995
Uh... Dr. Grey, I've got OR 4
for the small bowel obstruction

472
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:09,474
and an angio suite
for the Swanson case.

473
00:19:09,498 --> 00:19:11,276
I thought you said the
angio suite was booked.

474
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,340
I have my ways. Let's go.

475
00:19:14,603 --> 00:19:16,687
Wait, so, they called
Bailey the Nazi?

476
00:19:16,756 --> 00:19:17,783
Yeah. Yes.

477
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:26,108
What do you mean,
"Don't ask me"?

478
00:19:26,132 --> 00:19:28,749
You're more pissed
off than any of us.

479
00:19:28,817 --> 00:19:31,652
Have you ever had a friend
who was like a really good friend,

480
00:19:31,721 --> 00:19:34,755
but you just want to make
out with 'em all the time?

481
00:19:34,823 --> 00:19:36,063
Oh, yeah.

482
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:38,125
Yeah, I used to
do that for years.

483
00:19:38,193 --> 00:19:39,627
And what happened?

484
00:19:39,695 --> 00:19:40,855
Sofia.

485
00:19:49,088 --> 00:19:50,454
So, um... Hey!

486
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:54,258
Question.

487
00:19:55,377 --> 00:19:57,211
When you update the I and O's,

488
00:19:57,279 --> 00:20:00,481
is it kind of just like
whenever you get to it or...

489
00:20:00,549 --> 00:20:01,749
I like to do it hourly.

490
00:20:01,818 --> 00:20:03,150
Sweet. I like that.

491
00:20:04,721 --> 00:20:05,786
You like what?

492
00:20:07,907 --> 00:20:09,773
Hourly. It's just...

493
00:20:09,842 --> 00:20:12,359
It's like it's a good,
round time frame,

494
00:20:12,427 --> 00:20:15,713
and there's one every
hour, so you don't forget to...

495
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:16,809
I don't know why I said that.

496
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:18,532
That was really weak.

497
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,585
Pathetic and sad.

498
00:20:21,654 --> 00:20:23,515
Hey. ISAAC: Whoa!
Where you going?

499
00:20:23,539 --> 00:20:25,067
I gave you four
hours. Time's up.

500
00:20:25,091 --> 00:20:26,273
No, no, no. You can't leave.

501
00:20:26,342 --> 00:20:27,820
You can't hold me
here. I'm not a hostage.

502
00:20:27,844 --> 00:20:29,126
No, I know, but...

503
00:20:36,502 --> 00:20:37,985
Bailey, may I have
a word with you?

504
00:20:38,054 --> 00:20:39,853
I'm sorry. Huge deadline, sir.

505
00:20:41,024 --> 00:20:42,256
Okay, where are we?

506
00:20:42,325 --> 00:20:43,518
We're nowhere. Oh,
my God! Come on!

507
00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:44,786
This is... The tumor has invaded

508
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:46,043
the cavernous sinus.

509
00:20:46,112 --> 00:20:47,923
I'm planning an approach.
The wrong approach.

510
00:20:47,947 --> 00:20:49,291
And the recovery
time that you're asking

511
00:20:49,315 --> 00:20:50,592
for is completely unreasonable.

512
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:52,494
We need more time.
No, we don't have it.

513
00:20:52,518 --> 00:20:54,751
Look, I have to go tell
this woman something, so...

514
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,653
Jade's left. She
just walked out.

515
00:20:56,722 --> 00:20:58,956
You let her? I gave you one job!

516
00:20:59,024 --> 00:21:00,369
Dr. Wilson was trying
to reason with her,

517
00:21:00,393 --> 00:21:02,104
but she knows that we
can't legally stop her.

518
00:21:02,128 --> 00:21:04,123
Or physically stop
her. Well, convince her.

519
00:21:04,147 --> 00:21:05,441
Go find her and
get her back here!

520
00:21:05,465 --> 00:21:06,597
Okay.

521
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:09,032
I gave them one thing!

522
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:11,268
I gave you one thing!

523
00:21:11,337 --> 00:21:12,803
And I started this day thinking

524
00:21:12,871 --> 00:21:14,311
we could accomplish
the impossible,

525
00:21:14,373 --> 00:21:15,767
but now I'm gonna
end the day with

526
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:17,102
a woman probably
dead on the street

527
00:21:17,126 --> 00:21:19,220
and a thousand African
children who can't read.

528
00:21:19,244 --> 00:21:20,622
I don't know what we
were supposed to do.

529
00:21:20,646 --> 00:21:23,497
More. I expected more.

530
00:21:23,566 --> 00:21:25,766
So damn much more.

531
00:21:30,323 --> 00:21:32,643
What do a thousand African
children have to do with this?

532
00:21:38,948 --> 00:21:41,231
Jade! Please, you can't leave.

533
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,967
People are waiting for me.
I'll come back when I can.

534
00:21:44,036 --> 00:21:46,269
No, no, no. There
may be no coming back.

535
00:21:46,339 --> 00:21:47,483
Dr. Bailey was right.

536
00:21:47,507 --> 00:21:48,950
Your symptoms suggest

537
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:50,519
that surgery needs
to happen now.

538
00:21:50,543 --> 00:21:54,527
How many people can you
help if you're dead or blind or...

539
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:57,197
Whoa!

540
00:22:08,061 --> 00:22:09,888
Don't worry. I'm gonna
get you out of there.

541
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:12,073
No, don't touch her.
Jade, don't move.

542
00:22:12,097 --> 00:22:13,225
Let us through, please.

543
00:22:13,249 --> 00:22:14,325
Jade, are you all right?

544
00:22:14,349 --> 00:22:16,967
I caught her head.
She didn't hit her head.

545
00:22:17,036 --> 00:22:18,336
Oh, my God.

546
00:22:18,404 --> 00:22:20,087
I'm so stupid.

547
00:22:20,156 --> 00:22:21,288
I'm so stupid.

548
00:22:21,374 --> 00:22:23,518
She might've aggravated
her spine fracture.

549
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:25,503
Step back. That's too
small. It won't support her.

550
00:22:25,527 --> 00:22:26,810
I got it.

551
00:22:28,381 --> 00:22:31,382
Jade, just try not to move.

552
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:32,916
I can't move.

553
00:22:32,985 --> 00:22:35,085
I can't feel my
legs. They're numb.

554
00:22:37,706 --> 00:22:40,140
Okay, on my count.
One, two, three.

555
00:22:40,226 --> 00:22:42,125
Easy, easy. Watch her neck.

556
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:43,728
Good. And slide.

557
00:22:45,014 --> 00:22:47,397
Dr. Wilson, are you okay?
Can I get you anything?

558
00:22:47,466 --> 00:22:48,933
Yeah, I'm fine.

559
00:22:49,001 --> 00:22:51,085
Good job on the door,
DeLuca. Quick thinking.

560
00:22:51,153 --> 00:22:52,547
Yeah, you should
be a contractor.

561
00:22:52,571 --> 00:22:53,631
You still could. You're young.

562
00:22:53,655 --> 00:22:55,739
Jo, can we get an OR?

563
00:22:55,808 --> 00:22:57,090
One, two, three.

564
00:22:59,478 --> 00:23:00,822
Is she centered? Yeah.

565
00:23:00,846 --> 00:23:02,613
Let's move.

566
00:23:02,681 --> 00:23:05,982
And then today,
it's like I'm invisible.

567
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:07,851
I mean, I don't
know what it means.

568
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,654
Maybe the kiss meant
nothing and we're friends.

569
00:23:11,924 --> 00:23:14,257
I mean, I guess
what I'm asking is,

570
00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:16,593
if it were you,
if I kissed you...

571
00:23:16,662 --> 00:23:18,190
Wait. No, I'm not
saying that you and I...

572
00:23:18,214 --> 00:23:19,313
We're not kissing,

573
00:23:19,381 --> 00:23:22,883
but if a guy kisses you
and he asks you out,

574
00:23:22,952 --> 00:23:27,120
and then you refuse to look
at him for the rest of the day,

575
00:23:27,189 --> 00:23:28,489
what exactly are you thinking?

576
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:30,274
I can't help you.

577
00:23:30,342 --> 00:23:31,875
My marriage is collapsing,

578
00:23:31,944 --> 00:23:34,678
and I can't do anything about
it because he won't talk to me.

579
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:36,508
You see? You get
it. No, I don't get it

580
00:23:36,532 --> 00:23:38,009
because I'm trapped in a bubble!

581
00:23:38,033 --> 00:23:39,444
You are not trapped in a bubble.

582
00:23:39,468 --> 00:23:41,480
You have the freedom to roam
and talk to anyone you'd like,

583
00:23:41,504 --> 00:23:42,903
so stop talking to me.

584
00:23:42,971 --> 00:23:45,272
Go talk to Shepherd. Ask
her what she thinks about it.

585
00:23:45,341 --> 00:23:47,152
You know what?
You're right. You're right.

586
00:23:47,176 --> 00:23:48,953
If I want a reaction, I
should just force one.

587
00:23:48,977 --> 00:23:50,522
I should just go right
up to her and be direct.

588
00:23:50,546 --> 00:23:52,357
I'm saying stop talking to me!

589
00:23:52,381 --> 00:23:54,764
Oh! I need to go.
Hang in there, Kepner.

590
00:24:07,363 --> 00:24:09,029
Hey, are we ready?

591
00:24:15,204 --> 00:24:17,471
Which approach
are you going to use?

592
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:19,418
Jade's fall caused
her spinal fracture

593
00:24:19,442 --> 00:24:21,258
to become severely unstable,

594
00:24:21,327 --> 00:24:23,438
so Pierce and I will have
to repair it at the same time.

595
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:24,545
It's not ideal, but...

596
00:24:24,613 --> 00:24:26,547
We sit Jade up for a craniotomy,

597
00:24:26,615 --> 00:24:28,481
it would paralyze her forever.

598
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:31,067
So we'll be doing this
surgery endonasally.

599
00:24:31,137 --> 00:24:32,197
Which is the wrong approach.

600
00:24:32,221 --> 00:24:33,821
We're out of options.

601
00:24:34,774 --> 00:24:36,273
Warren, go scrub.

602
00:24:38,177 --> 00:24:40,537
Someone needs to
sign off on the case.

603
00:24:47,553 --> 00:24:48,713
All right, I will.

604
00:24:55,094 --> 00:24:57,244
Do they all hate me?

605
00:24:57,313 --> 00:24:59,045
I try not to listen.

606
00:24:59,948 --> 00:25:01,748
So they're talking.

607
00:25:03,285 --> 00:25:04,496
Did I push too hard?

608
00:25:06,622 --> 00:25:08,305
Do you think I'm wrong here?

609
00:25:09,175 --> 00:25:11,375
What do you think?

610
00:25:11,443 --> 00:25:15,062
I think I have put us
all in a terrible position.

611
00:25:15,131 --> 00:25:16,980
Yeah, well, I
think you're right.

612
00:25:17,049 --> 00:25:21,201
And I'm in one, too, so
can I just work, please?

613
00:25:35,768 --> 00:25:38,102
So check the urine output
and page me with any changes.

614
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:39,336
On it.

615
00:25:40,606 --> 00:25:41,638
Busy day.

616
00:25:43,209 --> 00:25:45,859
Has Bailey talked to
you about anything?

617
00:25:45,928 --> 00:25:48,662
Talk? All she does
is talk to me or at me.

618
00:25:48,748 --> 00:25:50,980
She dumped her
entire schedule on me

619
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:53,801
and expects me to
get it all done today.

620
00:25:53,869 --> 00:25:55,135
Yeah, I've been hearing that.

621
00:25:55,204 --> 00:25:57,404
The only reason I'm
holding up is Edwards.

622
00:25:57,473 --> 00:25:59,339
I mean, she's on top of it.

623
00:25:59,408 --> 00:26:03,276
I understand why Amelia requests
her. Edwards gets things done.

624
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:06,008
Bone graft is in. And...

625
00:26:07,383 --> 00:26:08,515
Yeah, we're done.

626
00:26:08,584 --> 00:26:10,366
Warren, ease down
on the retractor.

627
00:26:10,436 --> 00:26:11,735
Got it.

628
00:26:11,804 --> 00:26:12,897
Shepherd, how are we?

629
00:26:12,921 --> 00:26:14,299
If I can get in
a little further,

630
00:26:14,323 --> 00:26:15,700
the margins will
be close to perfect.

631
00:26:15,724 --> 00:26:19,225
Hold on. Can you
advance the scope?

632
00:26:19,294 --> 00:26:20,722
Damn it. MAGGIE:
What the hell happened?

633
00:26:20,746 --> 00:26:22,357
We hit the carotid. I
can't see a thing. Suction.

634
00:26:22,381 --> 00:26:23,597
How can we help?

635
00:26:23,666 --> 00:26:25,027
We need to compress this artery.

636
00:26:25,051 --> 00:26:26,078
Wilson, we need more
packing in here, now.

637
00:26:26,102 --> 00:26:27,451
Set up another suction.

638
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:28,763
Blood's coming out of her mouth.

639
00:26:28,787 --> 00:26:30,420
God, she's gonna bleed out.

640
00:26:30,489 --> 00:26:31,583
Should've opened her skull.
I knew this would happen!

641
00:26:31,607 --> 00:26:32,884
Just keep packing! Faster!

642
00:26:32,908 --> 00:26:34,252
Come on! Pack! More!
BENJAMIN: Let's go.

643
00:26:34,276 --> 00:26:35,809
Pressure's down to 85.

644
00:26:35,877 --> 00:26:37,289
Try 5% albumin.
Call for some FFP.

645
00:26:37,313 --> 00:26:38,978
Pressure's down to 75.

646
00:26:39,047 --> 00:26:41,331
More suction. I still
can't see a thing.

647
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,484
<i>Did we try Desmopressin?</i>

648
00:26:49,508 --> 00:26:52,075
<i>Unit six. We're down to 75.</i>

649
00:26:55,514 --> 00:26:56,613
Oh! Hey, Bailey.

650
00:26:56,682 --> 00:26:58,476
So, your adenoma
resection had a rebleed.

651
00:26:58,500 --> 00:26:59,766
It's stable now.

652
00:26:59,835 --> 00:27:01,479
But then Mrs. What's-her-name,
with the lap chole...

653
00:27:01,503 --> 00:27:02,719
Grey, I can't right now.

654
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:04,588
Bailey, these are your patients!

655
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,174
Look, I'm happy
you're chief. I'm all for it.

656
00:27:07,242 --> 00:27:09,954
But I am taking my day to
service your patients and mine,

657
00:27:09,978 --> 00:27:11,622
and it's getting
done. I'm on it.

658
00:27:11,646 --> 00:27:13,825
But if you're gonna do this to
me, if you're gonna drown me,

659
00:27:13,849 --> 00:27:16,744
at least take two seconds to
listen to the update of your patients.

660
00:27:16,768 --> 00:27:18,551
I deserve more
than to be dismissed.

661
00:27:19,505 --> 00:27:20,705
I deserve more.

662
00:27:22,541 --> 00:27:24,141
Respectfully, Chief.

663
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:35,797
- Chest tube is in.
- Guys, is there a plan here?

664
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:37,666
Because she's lost a
third of her blood volume.

665
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:38,900
I can do a muscle
patch. With a little glue,

666
00:27:38,924 --> 00:27:40,035
it could form a clot, and
we can seal the vessel.

667
00:27:40,059 --> 00:27:42,075
No, that's a temporary fix.

668
00:27:42,144 --> 00:27:44,022
We need to open her neck and
do a primary repair of the carotid.

669
00:27:44,046 --> 00:27:45,507
That's a major stroke risk.

670
00:27:45,531 --> 00:27:46,875
Before she dies on
the table. Prep the neck.

671
00:27:46,899 --> 00:27:48,499
Wilson, you keep suctioning.

672
00:27:48,551 --> 00:27:50,078
- Who am I listening to?
- You need to listen to me!

673
00:27:50,102 --> 00:27:51,562
You open her neck, she's
gonna bleed out in seconds.

674
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:52,885
You let me do this,

675
00:27:52,954 --> 00:27:54,249
I can stop the bleeding and
help you remove the tumor.

676
00:27:54,273 --> 00:27:55,705
Do not open her neck, please.

677
00:27:57,876 --> 00:27:58,876
Move.

678
00:28:01,497 --> 00:28:03,308
All right, we can use a patch
from the thoracotomy incision.

679
00:28:03,332 --> 00:28:05,360
Pierce, I need a piece of
intercostal muscle right now, please.

680
00:28:05,384 --> 00:28:06,516
Scalpel.

681
00:28:35,814 --> 00:28:37,181
That's for you.

682
00:28:39,017 --> 00:28:40,595
I wanted to give it
to you this morning,

683
00:28:40,619 --> 00:28:44,088
but somebody got
herself in a big damn hurry.

684
00:28:49,878 --> 00:28:52,012
It's mine.

685
00:28:52,081 --> 00:28:54,481
I got it my first
day of residency.

686
00:28:55,017 --> 00:28:57,868
I replaced the earbuds.

687
00:28:57,937 --> 00:29:01,855
I never had anyone to
pass something along to.

688
00:29:03,275 --> 00:29:04,474
But then...

689
00:29:06,612 --> 00:29:07,756
I just thought that...

690
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:10,446
Sir, I don't deserve this.

691
00:29:10,515 --> 00:29:12,043
Well, if you think that,
then maybe you don't...

692
00:29:12,067 --> 00:29:14,547
Because I'm not the
right person for this job.

693
00:29:15,504 --> 00:29:18,304
You thought I was,
I thought I was,

694
00:29:18,374 --> 00:29:23,109
and I had these
great plans, but...

695
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:27,481
I mean, if this is my first day,
then I don't deserve a second.

696
00:29:28,517 --> 00:29:30,283
I wanted it to go...

697
00:29:30,352 --> 00:29:31,685
Perfectly.

698
00:29:31,754 --> 00:29:33,820
It won't. It can't.

699
00:29:33,889 --> 00:29:35,700
I mean, this job is too
much for one person.

700
00:29:35,724 --> 00:29:36,823
You did it.

701
00:29:36,891 --> 00:29:38,703
Because I listened to
those who came before me

702
00:29:38,727 --> 00:29:40,477
and counted on those under me.

703
00:29:40,529 --> 00:29:41,745
I tried to...

704
00:29:41,814 --> 00:29:43,054
No, you barked like a general.

705
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:45,666
They are generals.

706
00:29:45,734 --> 00:29:47,367
They know how to mobilize.

707
00:29:47,436 --> 00:29:48,885
What they need is a leader.

708
00:29:48,954 --> 00:29:53,273
If I did my job well, it's not
because people listened to me.

709
00:29:53,341 --> 00:29:55,608
It's because they
believed in me.

710
00:29:56,912 --> 00:29:59,152
Believed that I knew
them well enough

711
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:01,198
and believed in them enough

712
00:30:01,266 --> 00:30:04,434
to tell them how and
when to use their brains.

713
00:30:07,456 --> 00:30:09,990
I'm talking about
people like you.

714
00:30:10,059 --> 00:30:12,539
That kind of belief,
you have to earn it,

715
00:30:12,577 --> 00:30:14,928
and you cannot earn it in a day.

716
00:30:16,932 --> 00:30:19,599
You want someone to
run a four-minute mile,

717
00:30:19,667 --> 00:30:20,917
you don't chase them.

718
00:30:20,986 --> 00:30:23,987
You don't give them
something to run from.

719
00:30:26,091 --> 00:30:28,291
You give them
something to run to.

720
00:30:58,607 --> 00:31:00,034
Avery, we need something else.

721
00:31:00,058 --> 00:31:02,542
Give it a chance.

722
00:31:02,611 --> 00:31:03,988
Shepherd is right.
It's not holding.

723
00:31:04,012 --> 00:31:06,813
Don't move the
patch. Just give it time.

724
00:31:06,882 --> 00:31:08,426
We could try embolization.

725
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:10,483
Go up through
the groin, coil it.

726
00:31:10,552 --> 00:31:12,063
It'll take too long to
get a C-arm in here.

727
00:31:12,087 --> 00:31:13,186
There!

728
00:31:15,641 --> 00:31:17,007
Oh, my God.

729
00:31:17,075 --> 00:31:18,903
It's holding. Are we okay?

730
00:31:18,927 --> 00:31:20,143
I hope so.

731
00:31:20,212 --> 00:31:21,355
Yeah, me, too.

732
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:24,397
Dr. Avery. It's Dr. Kepner. 911.

733
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:30,620
What's wrong? What's
happened? We need to talk.

734
00:31:31,623 --> 00:31:33,423
God, April, I thought
you were dying!

735
00:31:33,491 --> 00:31:35,537
I kind of am dying. I
feel like we both are.

736
00:31:35,561 --> 00:31:37,322
You paged me 911
so we could do this?

737
00:31:37,346 --> 00:31:39,095
Yes! Yes! Okay.

738
00:31:39,164 --> 00:31:41,008
I needed to force a
reaction out of you

739
00:31:41,032 --> 00:31:43,967
because I am in a glass
prison and I can't do anything.

740
00:31:44,036 --> 00:31:46,014
So you're gonna stand there,
and you're not gonna walk away

741
00:31:46,038 --> 00:31:47,582
and you're gonna talk to
me. You don't want to hear it.

742
00:31:47,606 --> 00:31:50,090
Jackson, I... We
already talked, April.

743
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:52,625
I told you what I needed,
and you didn't hear it.

744
00:31:52,695 --> 00:31:54,723
You didn't listen. You went
halfway around the damn world.

745
00:31:54,747 --> 00:31:56,012
That wasn't a talk, Jackson.

746
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:57,764
That was an ultimatum,

747
00:31:57,833 --> 00:31:59,411
and our marriage has never
been a marriage of ultimatums.

748
00:31:59,435 --> 00:32:01,755
Oh, come on. It wasn't an
ultimatum. I gave you a choice.

749
00:32:02,404 --> 00:32:04,004
No.

750
00:32:04,072 --> 00:32:07,841
No, I made a choice
long before that,

751
00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:11,761
long before Samuel, the
army, any of it, and so did you.

752
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:15,382
We stood up in that
weird-smelling little chapel in Tahoe,

753
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:19,919
and before God we chose to
love one another until we die.

754
00:32:19,988 --> 00:32:21,182
You made that choice.

755
00:32:21,206 --> 00:32:22,567
We chose to love
and honor one another.

756
00:32:22,591 --> 00:32:24,069
Honor one another,
which you couldn't do.

757
00:32:24,093 --> 00:32:25,770
In front of God, we promised
each other that, through...

758
00:32:25,794 --> 00:32:27,555
'Cause you couldn't hear me
telling you I needed you to stay.

759
00:32:27,579 --> 00:32:28,778
I needed to go!

760
00:32:28,847 --> 00:32:29,996
And you went!

761
00:32:30,065 --> 00:32:33,032
You did what you needed
to do. Twice, actually.

762
00:32:34,135 --> 00:32:36,335
This marriage is
full of ultimatums.

763
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:38,588
They're all yours.

764
00:32:42,644 --> 00:32:43,994
Look, we...

765
00:32:45,897 --> 00:32:47,697
We've been through a lot.

766
00:32:49,468 --> 00:32:50,750
And you've changed.

767
00:32:52,304 --> 00:32:53,970
No.

768
00:32:54,039 --> 00:32:55,905
I've grown.

769
00:32:57,042 --> 00:32:58,122
And...

770
00:32:59,545 --> 00:33:01,945
We haven't been through a lot.

771
00:33:02,013 --> 00:33:07,100
Jackson, we're going
through a lot right now.

772
00:33:07,168 --> 00:33:09,586
We're going through a hard part.

773
00:33:11,156 --> 00:33:16,309
This is the "worse"
of "for better or worse."

774
00:33:16,378 --> 00:33:21,614
This is the mud, and we just
have to pull each other through it.

775
00:33:21,683 --> 00:33:24,763
We just... We have to
push, and we have to fight.

776
00:33:28,056 --> 00:33:30,307
I'm not sure we are
worth fighting for.

777
00:33:32,944 --> 00:33:34,026
What?

778
00:33:35,814 --> 00:33:36,958
No, please don't...

779
00:33:38,783 --> 00:33:40,616
Ow! God!

780
00:34:17,322 --> 00:34:18,521
Okay.

781
00:34:23,995 --> 00:34:25,845
So, where are we with Jade?

782
00:34:28,016 --> 00:34:30,717
I got the whole tumor.

783
00:34:30,786 --> 00:34:34,004
She had a bad
left carotid bleed.

784
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:36,256
I took her to angio,
put in a stent.

785
00:34:36,325 --> 00:34:39,059
But she's likely
to have deficits.

786
00:34:39,127 --> 00:34:41,294
Possibly a stroke, paralysis...

787
00:34:41,363 --> 00:34:43,124
She's still out. some speech
and language issues...

788
00:34:43,148 --> 00:34:45,026
Pressure's good, but we
won't know. vision loss.

789
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:47,350
Or she could just be in a coma.

790
00:34:54,726 --> 00:34:57,160
You people are extraordinary.

791
00:34:59,464 --> 00:35:02,949
I mean, I came in
here today and did

792
00:35:03,018 --> 00:35:06,519
all kinds of things wrong,

793
00:35:06,588 --> 00:35:08,805
but in spite of that,

794
00:35:08,873 --> 00:35:15,795
you all still did amazing
and perfect work.

795
00:35:15,864 --> 00:35:20,550
And you found a way to do
something that was, in fact, impossible.

796
00:35:21,954 --> 00:35:26,789
So if there is a bad
outcome, it's my bad outcome.

797
00:35:29,761 --> 00:35:31,094
Tomorrow...

798
00:35:33,665 --> 00:35:34,897
I will be better.

799
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:49,540
Hey, Cross, let's go. You're
prepping OR. Five for Grey's lab chole.

800
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:50,597
I'm sorry. What?

801
00:35:50,665 --> 00:35:51,905
Dr. Wilson has me today.

802
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:54,217
It's for the Chief.

803
00:35:54,285 --> 00:35:55,484
Now, Cross. Come.

804
00:35:55,553 --> 00:35:56,686
No, stay.

805
00:35:56,754 --> 00:35:58,666
You've cut lines,
you've stolen nurses,

806
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:00,484
you've even rearranged
the OR board.

807
00:36:00,508 --> 00:36:03,142
You are not stealing
him. He is mine. Mine.

808
00:36:03,228 --> 00:36:04,660
Back off.

809
00:36:04,729 --> 00:36:06,090
If the Chief needs him for
Grey, you got to let him go.

810
00:36:06,114 --> 00:36:07,947
Thank you, Dr. Karev.

811
00:36:08,033 --> 00:36:09,532
Cross, come.

812
00:36:12,254 --> 00:36:14,020
I'll come back.

813
00:36:14,089 --> 00:36:16,088
Alex, she's lying.

814
00:36:16,157 --> 00:36:17,535
She's been pulling this crap
all day, saying it's "for the Chief."

815
00:36:17,559 --> 00:36:18,919
She's so full of it. Stop.

816
00:36:18,943 --> 00:36:20,221
Stop what? Stop whining.

817
00:36:20,245 --> 00:36:21,439
Look, she worked you.

818
00:36:21,463 --> 00:36:23,696
She got what she wanted
by beating the system.

819
00:36:23,765 --> 00:36:24,964
It's a genius move.

820
00:36:25,033 --> 00:36:26,816
If I had come up
with it, I would've.

821
00:36:26,885 --> 00:36:28,429
Look, you're just
mad that you didn't.

822
00:36:28,453 --> 00:36:30,453
Deal with it or come up
with something better.

823
00:36:39,865 --> 00:36:40,897
What are you doing?

824
00:36:40,965 --> 00:36:42,660
I checked with
Griggs. You're clear.

825
00:36:42,684 --> 00:36:45,417
I mean, he was leaving, so
he asked me to let you out.

826
00:36:45,486 --> 00:36:46,853
So I'm not sick.

827
00:36:46,921 --> 00:36:48,265
Most likely contact dermatitis.

828
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:50,990
Told him that 12 hours ago.

829
00:36:51,059 --> 00:36:55,061
Ah... And look, I'm sorry
if, you know, I hurt you.

830
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:56,573
We have to be
honest with each other.

831
00:36:56,597 --> 00:36:58,882
You were just being
honest. I appreciate that.

832
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,533
Thank you.

833
00:37:00,602 --> 00:37:02,012
I mean, you're wrong. April.

834
00:37:02,036 --> 00:37:04,454
But we are something
worth fighting for,

835
00:37:04,506 --> 00:37:06,873
and I want to fight.

836
00:37:06,941 --> 00:37:08,441
So I'll fight for
the both of us.

837
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:10,643
I will launch a
full-scale assault.

838
00:37:10,712 --> 00:37:13,346
I will ambush and slash and burn

839
00:37:13,414 --> 00:37:15,948
and fight until I
am bloody for us.

840
00:37:16,017 --> 00:37:20,720
I will fight to the death
because I vowed to.

841
00:37:20,789 --> 00:37:23,206
And nothing that's happened
since then has changed that.

842
00:37:23,275 --> 00:37:27,193
You see? This is it. You
just want what you want.

843
00:37:27,262 --> 00:37:28,578
You don't care what I think.

844
00:37:28,647 --> 00:37:31,380
I love you too much to let
my mistake end our marriage.

845
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:34,918
I won't break my promise
to you, so I'm gonna fight.

846
00:37:34,986 --> 00:37:36,252
And I'm gonna win.

847
00:37:40,641 --> 00:37:42,242
Oh! Arizona! Excuse me.

848
00:37:43,144 --> 00:37:44,310
Hey.

849
00:37:44,379 --> 00:37:46,279
Here. Sofia forgot this.

850
00:37:46,348 --> 00:37:48,581
We're on... We
made it to page 12.

851
00:37:48,649 --> 00:37:49,883
She is exhausted,

852
00:37:49,951 --> 00:37:51,729
so you can probably get
away with an early bedtime.

853
00:37:51,753 --> 00:37:52,796
Thanks. Mmm-hmm.

854
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:53,898
Hey, um... Big date?

855
00:37:53,922 --> 00:37:55,288
Oh! You heard?

856
00:37:55,357 --> 00:37:56,597
Yeah, I mean, everyone heard.

857
00:37:58,627 --> 00:38:02,178
You know, you can tell me,
Callie. You can always tell me.

858
00:38:04,416 --> 00:38:06,382
Yeah? Yeah.

859
00:38:06,451 --> 00:38:09,018
You'd like her. She's
funny and sharp.

860
00:38:09,071 --> 00:38:11,404
And we don't just find
the same things funny,

861
00:38:11,473 --> 00:38:12,900
we say the same
thing at the same time.

862
00:38:12,924 --> 00:38:14,419
It's really almost like... Okay.

863
00:38:14,443 --> 00:38:15,937
No, yeah, you can dial
back the enthusiasm.

864
00:38:15,961 --> 00:38:17,126
No, really.

865
00:38:17,195 --> 00:38:19,511
It's like we share
the same brain.

866
00:38:19,581 --> 00:38:21,698
I mean, read the
room. That's all.

867
00:38:21,766 --> 00:38:24,367
Well, all I'm saying
is you'd like her.

868
00:38:35,947 --> 00:38:36,979
Hi.

869
00:38:37,048 --> 00:38:38,088
Hi.

870
00:38:43,287 --> 00:38:44,970
Why won't you talk to me? I...

871
00:38:45,039 --> 00:38:48,074
You won't even look at
me, so help me out, okay?

872
00:38:48,143 --> 00:38:51,411
I mean, are you upset,
angry, confused, or...

873
00:38:51,479 --> 00:38:53,312
That one. I'm confused.

874
00:38:53,381 --> 00:38:55,615
If I had to pick one.

875
00:38:55,683 --> 00:38:57,850
Well, then let's talk
about it so we can...

876
00:38:57,919 --> 00:39:00,359
I can't talk about it because
then we start all the kissing,

877
00:39:00,422 --> 00:39:01,699
and I don't know why. I don't...

878
00:39:01,723 --> 00:39:03,389
I don't know what it means.

879
00:39:03,458 --> 00:39:04,974
What does it mean?

880
00:39:05,777 --> 00:39:07,043
What do you think it means?

881
00:39:07,095 --> 00:39:08,494
I don't know.

882
00:39:09,064 --> 00:39:10,730
Well, then...

883
00:39:12,601 --> 00:39:15,134
Maybe we should...

884
00:39:17,405 --> 00:39:18,487
We should talk about it.

885
00:39:18,556 --> 00:39:19,655
Okay.

886
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:22,825
Let's talk.

887
00:39:34,139 --> 00:39:35,838
Jade.

888
00:39:35,907 --> 00:39:37,256
Jade, can you hear me?

889
00:39:54,358 --> 00:39:56,158
Now can I get out of here?

890
00:39:56,211 --> 00:39:58,294
Yes.

891
00:39:58,363 --> 00:40:01,330
Oh, you will soon enough.

892
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:06,001
Yeah.

893
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:10,784
Oh, Grey! Just the
person I needed to see.

894
00:40:10,808 --> 00:40:12,741
A hot appe came in tonight.

895
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:14,922
Now, it hasn't ruptured,
but you need to...

896
00:40:14,946 --> 00:40:17,513
Am I being punished
for yelling at you?

897
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:18,748
On the contrary.

898
00:40:18,817 --> 00:40:20,967
It's fine. I just need to know.

899
00:40:21,036 --> 00:40:23,681
Oh, you don't think you deserved
my piling my service on you.

900
00:40:23,705 --> 00:40:24,754
No.

901
00:40:24,823 --> 00:40:25,850
I believe you do.

902
00:40:25,874 --> 00:40:26,940
What?

903
00:40:27,008 --> 00:40:28,319
I'm gonna let
you in on a secret.

904
00:40:28,343 --> 00:40:31,511
See, when Webber had
this job, it was easier for him.

905
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:33,224
And Hunt had it
easier than I do.

906
00:40:33,248 --> 00:40:34,791
You know why? I don't.

907
00:40:34,815 --> 00:40:37,100
Because they had me.

908
00:40:37,168 --> 00:40:40,937
I need a me, and I believe
that you can be a me for me.

909
00:40:41,006 --> 00:40:42,246
I need you to be my me.

910
00:40:44,142 --> 00:40:46,421
I'd like to appoint you
chief of general surgery.

911
00:40:46,445 --> 00:40:47,445
Me?

912
00:40:47,512 --> 00:40:48,890
Because you deserve it.

913
00:40:48,914 --> 00:40:50,312
Because you can take it.

914
00:40:50,381 --> 00:40:54,400
Because I leaned on
you, and you held me up.

915
00:40:54,469 --> 00:40:57,603
You are the calm in
the center of the chaos.

916
00:40:57,672 --> 00:41:00,106
You have been since I met you.

917
00:41:00,175 --> 00:41:01,215
And I need you.

918
00:41:01,693 --> 00:41:02,992
Hmm.

919
00:41:03,762 --> 00:41:04,822
You want it or not?

920
00:41:04,846 --> 00:41:06,412
Yes.

921
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,241
Go see this appe, and
don't complain to me again.

922
00:41:08,265 --> 00:41:09,710
<i>Without a strong leader,</i>

923
00:41:09,734 --> 00:41:11,078
<i>the whole machine's
out of whack.</i>

924
00:41:11,102 --> 00:41:12,952
Congratulations, Dr. Grey.

925
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:15,699
Now when you tell people you
need something for the Chief,

926
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:17,634
it really will be.

927
00:41:17,658 --> 00:41:20,387
That's right. I know what
you've been saying today.

928
00:41:20,411 --> 00:41:21,588
<i>But it's pretty simple.</i>

929
00:41:21,612 --> 00:41:23,913
<i>If the brain's working,
the body will listen.</i>

930
00:41:23,982 --> 00:41:26,048
Your limbs want to hold you up.

931
00:41:26,117 --> 00:41:28,484
Your lungs want to breathe.

932
00:41:28,553 --> 00:41:31,003
Your heart wants to beat.

933
00:41:31,072 --> 00:41:32,505
But none of them are any good

934
00:41:34,075 --> 00:41:35,507
without the brain.

935
00:41:43,685 --> 00:41:46,435
Aren't you exhausted?

936
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:48,733
I just need to make sure
that I'm prepared for tomorrow.

937
00:41:48,757 --> 00:41:51,102
<i>The brain keeps
everything all together.</i>

938
00:41:51,126 --> 00:41:54,393
Look, you gonna
be great tomorrow.

939
00:41:54,462 --> 00:41:55,879
Wait. Wait! Besides.

940
00:41:55,947 --> 00:41:59,065
There are better
ways to get prepared.

941
00:42:00,552 --> 00:42:01,552
Chief.

942
00:42:01,619 --> 00:42:02,752
<i>Like a boss.</i>
