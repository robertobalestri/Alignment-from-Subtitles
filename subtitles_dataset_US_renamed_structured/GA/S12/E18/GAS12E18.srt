1
00:00:03,204 --> 00:00:05,404
<i>Previously on</i> Grey's Anatomy...

2
00:00:05,473 --> 00:00:07,989
I got to open him up
now. If I don't, he's dead.

3
00:00:08,058 --> 00:00:10,437
Again, I'm not gonna allow you
to open up a man in my ward.

4
00:00:10,461 --> 00:00:13,045
This is not an OR. You
are not an attending.

5
00:00:13,114 --> 00:00:15,514
No. No, no, no.
Are... Are you insane?

6
00:00:15,583 --> 00:00:17,093
Dr. Siegel, this
man is going to die.

7
00:00:17,117 --> 00:00:18,211
Warren, what are you doing?

8
00:00:18,235 --> 00:00:20,485
I got it. I got his
aorta in my hand.

9
00:00:20,554 --> 00:00:22,487
Yeah, I got a pulse.

10
00:00:22,556 --> 00:00:24,551
Right now, you better be praying
that this man doesn't die on the table.

11
00:00:24,575 --> 00:00:25,857
This was a judgment call.

12
00:00:25,926 --> 00:00:28,943
I took a risk, it paid off,
and this man is alive.

13
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:31,241
I feel like I'd get in trouble
for something like that.

14
00:00:31,265 --> 00:00:33,476
It must be nice being
married to the chief.

15
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,028
I don't think that's
what's going on here.

16
00:00:35,052 --> 00:00:37,536
Really? Warren's
married to the chief,

17
00:00:37,604 --> 00:00:39,416
so he's scrubbed in
down there on a surgery

18
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,200
while we're stuck
watching up here.

19
00:00:41,224 --> 00:00:42,802
You don't think the two
are related? I know they are.

20
00:00:42,826 --> 00:00:44,003
It was a unique situation...

21
00:00:44,027 --> 00:00:46,294
I got an earful on
how unique it was.

22
00:00:46,363 --> 00:00:47,895
I'm clear on the situation.

23
00:00:47,964 --> 00:00:50,249
I was trying to save a
life. The man was dying.

24
00:00:50,317 --> 00:00:51,500
And how is he now?

25
00:00:51,569 --> 00:00:54,035
Alive. Stable. I
got to him in time.

26
00:00:54,104 --> 00:00:56,772
No, you got lucky.

27
00:00:56,841 --> 00:00:59,875
If you'd been left with a
dead man on that table

28
00:00:59,944 --> 00:01:01,610
after you did what you did,

29
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:05,030
I wouldn't be letting you off
with just a 3-day suspension.

30
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:07,699
You're suspending me?

31
00:01:12,122 --> 00:01:13,667
<i>I used to spend hours</i>

32
00:01:13,691 --> 00:01:16,241
<i>studying old footage of
my mother's surgeries.</i>

33
00:01:16,309 --> 00:01:18,360
<i>I dissected every move,</i>

34
00:01:18,428 --> 00:01:21,413
<i>every cut, every decision.</i>

35
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:25,384
<i>I was piecing together a puzzle,</i>

36
00:01:25,452 --> 00:01:28,086
<i>watching, studying, learning.</i>

37
00:01:28,155 --> 00:01:29,355
<i>It's a luxury we don't have</i>

38
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:31,434
<i>when a patient is
splayed open in front of us.</i>

39
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:32,857
Where's the main lobby?

40
00:01:34,478 --> 00:01:36,161
There.

41
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:37,930
<i>We can't rewind.</i>

42
00:01:37,998 --> 00:01:39,238
And the garage?

43
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:41,466
Over there.

44
00:01:41,534 --> 00:01:42,834
<i>There's no replay.</i>

45
00:01:42,903 --> 00:01:44,419
But he won't get that far.

46
00:01:44,488 --> 00:01:47,539
I got guys at all the doors,
guys rolling back tape.

47
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:48,773
We'll find him.

48
00:01:48,842 --> 00:01:50,476
Yeah, you don't know that.

49
00:01:50,544 --> 00:01:52,511
Look, it's my job to overreact,

50
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:53,945
and I'm not there yet.

51
00:01:54,014 --> 00:01:57,149
I'm telling you, this is
not a Code Pink situation.

52
00:01:57,218 --> 00:01:59,485
<i>We just have to cut,</i>

53
00:01:59,553 --> 00:02:02,854
<i>and hope to God we know
what the hell we're doing.</i>

54
00:02:02,907 --> 00:02:05,840
You need to call a Code Pink
now. We're not there yet, Karev.

55
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:08,277
The kid's hiding. It
happens all the time.

56
00:02:08,345 --> 00:02:09,711
Dad's got anger issues.

57
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:11,258
Custody battle with a
huge fight just this morning.

58
00:02:11,282 --> 00:02:12,647
If he took the kid...

59
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:14,127
Statistically speaking,
that's not what happened.

60
00:02:14,151 --> 00:02:15,896
Not to mention, my
patient's infection puts him

61
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,597
at risk for an airway obstruction
if we don't find him right away.

62
00:02:17,621 --> 00:02:19,132
<i>Attention, Gage Dean,</i>

63
00:02:19,156 --> 00:02:20,889
<i>please return to your room.</i>

64
00:02:20,958 --> 00:02:22,724
<i>Attention, Gage Dean.</i>

65
00:02:22,793 --> 00:02:24,271
Are you kidding me
with that? He's six.

66
00:02:24,295 --> 00:02:25,738
He's not listening
to announcements,

67
00:02:25,762 --> 00:02:27,473
but I bet you his dad
is, which means you just

68
00:02:27,497 --> 00:02:29,175
scared the guy into
moving even faster.

69
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:31,677
I don't think you understand how
a Code Pink disrupts this facility.

70
00:02:31,701 --> 00:02:33,335
All automatic doors lock.

71
00:02:33,404 --> 00:02:34,769
Elevators stop functioning.

72
00:02:34,838 --> 00:02:36,078
Good. It'll stop the dad.

73
00:02:36,106 --> 00:02:38,373
No, it'll potentially
put patients in danger.

74
00:02:38,441 --> 00:02:39,691
There's a kid who's in danger,

75
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,354
and the longer we
stand here debating this,

76
00:02:41,378 --> 00:02:42,522
he's getting further away.

77
00:02:42,546 --> 00:02:44,212
Code Pink is a nuclear option.

78
00:02:44,281 --> 00:02:46,681
Just let my guys look
around for a little bit.

79
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:47,990
What if it was Tuck?

80
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,990
Call it.

81
00:02:55,059 --> 00:02:56,269
You sure you want to
pull the trigger on this?

82
00:02:56,293 --> 00:02:57,904
Sounding the alarm?
Initiating a lockdown?

83
00:02:57,928 --> 00:02:58,971
Yes, now. She's sure.

84
00:03:03,233 --> 00:03:04,616
Hey.

85
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:06,580
She's calling it.

86
00:03:06,604 --> 00:03:09,044
Jackson, I had no idea,
or I never would have...

87
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:10,538
I wasn't trying to...

88
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:12,202
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
I'm supposed to be, like,

89
00:03:12,226 --> 00:03:13,591
100 feet from you or something.

90
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:16,461
If I had known that
you weren't trying...

91
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:19,376
I thought you were
gonna take my baby, and...

92
00:03:20,817 --> 00:03:22,601
Did you set that
off for me, too?

93
00:03:29,826 --> 00:03:30,993
Oh, no.

94
00:03:31,061 --> 00:03:32,461
Quick, go, go, go, go, go.

95
00:03:32,529 --> 00:03:33,939
Why are we suddenly
running a relay race?

96
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:35,641
Code Pink. Hospital's
on lockdown.

97
00:03:35,665 --> 00:03:37,905
Those doors just
bolted shut behind us.

98
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:40,836
If we're gonna be stuck somewhere,
we need to have access to an OR.

99
00:03:42,572 --> 00:03:45,306
What is that, an alarm?

100
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:47,658
Code Pink. Missing kid.

101
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,895
Huh.

102
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:53,514
It's almost relaxing.

103
00:03:53,601 --> 00:03:56,034
They don't want
to freak people out.

104
00:03:56,103 --> 00:03:58,263
It seems like they
would want that.

105
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:04,226
Esophageal atresia,
pulmonary sequestration,

106
00:04:04,311 --> 00:04:06,389
spina bifida boy,
spina bifida girl,

107
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:08,780
and teratoma cutie, so great.

108
00:04:08,848 --> 00:04:09,942
Everyone's here.

109
00:04:09,966 --> 00:04:11,595
It says here the code's
for a 6-year-old kid,

110
00:04:11,619 --> 00:04:13,112
not an infant. I don't care.

111
00:04:13,136 --> 00:04:15,296
If someone's stealing babies,
you count all the babies.

112
00:04:19,777 --> 00:04:21,109
Brown hair, green shirt.

113
00:04:21,178 --> 00:04:22,944
Named Gage Dean.

114
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:25,229
Well, it's not like we can
do anything from in here.

115
00:04:26,567 --> 00:04:27,799
Gage?

116
00:04:27,868 --> 00:04:30,602
Gage Dean, are you in here?

117
00:04:30,671 --> 00:04:31,781
There. We did something.

118
00:04:33,056 --> 00:04:34,266
- Wire cutter.
- Mmm-hmm.

119
00:04:48,254 --> 00:04:50,099
I just need a description
of your husband, ma'am.

120
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,300
Ex-husband.

121
00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:52,902
I know the guy. I'm just
gonna start looking...

122
00:04:52,926 --> 00:04:54,453
The only way to get
through the doors right now

123
00:04:54,477 --> 00:04:55,605
is with one of these badges.

124
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:57,228
My men will fan out from peds.

125
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,813
They'll take it room by room.

126
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:00,465
We've got it
handled... Dr. Karev.

127
00:05:05,822 --> 00:05:07,122
Out of my way, Cross.

128
00:05:13,614 --> 00:05:15,447
No one came through
here with a kid, right?

129
00:05:15,516 --> 00:05:17,032
Six years old, green shirt?

130
00:05:17,101 --> 00:05:18,861
Uh, I don't think so, but
we're kind of slammed.

131
00:05:18,885 --> 00:05:20,129
I've got these other
kids from the accident.

132
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,331
I don't know.

133
00:05:21,355 --> 00:05:22,666
Bailey should have
called this thing earlier.

134
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:24,934
Hey, hey. He's probably
just hiding somewhere.

135
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:26,198
That's what kids do, right?

136
00:05:26,226 --> 00:05:27,542
Yeah, right.

137
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:53,919
We've walked the
western perimeter.

138
00:05:53,987 --> 00:05:56,107
Tell Stokes to report in with...

139
00:05:56,973 --> 00:05:58,350
Hold it.

140
00:05:58,374 --> 00:05:59,757
What?

141
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:01,093
Karev found him.

142
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:02,805
Kill the code. Start
running the reports.

143
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:04,563
He's okay.

144
00:06:04,631 --> 00:06:06,025
Oh, thank goodness
they found him.

145
00:06:06,049 --> 00:06:07,732
All right. How is he?

146
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,096
Well, he's a little shaken up, but
no worse for the wear, right, Gage?

147
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,787
We're all making overtime today.

148
00:06:11,855 --> 00:06:12,987
All righty.

149
00:06:14,591 --> 00:06:16,408
He was hiding. Like I said.

150
00:06:18,561 --> 00:06:20,641
Uh...

151
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:24,917
That's...

152
00:06:33,293 --> 00:06:35,026
Excuse me! Excuse me!

153
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:42,817
What?

154
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:46,699
What happened?

155
00:06:46,723 --> 00:06:48,339
Please. You have to help.

156
00:07:05,408 --> 00:07:06,669
I have to go. I have to go now.

157
00:07:06,693 --> 00:07:07,854
This baby's lost
almost all its volume.

158
00:07:07,878 --> 00:07:09,094
I still can't get a pulse.

159
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:10,662
I have to get to the NICU.

160
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,032
I was paged. I...

161
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:16,668
Oh, my God. What...
What is going on?

162
00:07:16,737 --> 00:07:18,069
What happened? What did you do?

163
00:07:18,138 --> 00:07:19,732
Chief, I don't think
she's gonna make it.

164
00:07:19,756 --> 00:07:21,134
You do not stop what you're
doing. Get us some free hands.

165
00:07:21,158 --> 00:07:23,375
She needs central access
and multiple units of blood.

166
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:26,206
Tube's in. Call upstairs and tell them
Robbins is gonna need a clear OR now!

167
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:27,846
All right.

168
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:29,325
You're getting tired.
Let's switch. Okay.

169
00:07:29,349 --> 00:07:31,499
Gloves. Who
butchered this woman?

170
00:07:31,568 --> 00:07:33,501
I need cricoid pressure!

171
00:07:33,569 --> 00:07:34,703
I know this patient.

172
00:07:34,771 --> 00:07:36,120
This is Gretchen McKay.

173
00:07:44,481 --> 00:07:45,847
What's your name, honey?

174
00:07:45,915 --> 00:07:47,482
My kids, please.

175
00:07:47,551 --> 00:07:48,745
Are they okay?

176
00:07:48,769 --> 00:07:50,863
There's three of them,
one girl and two boys.

177
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:53,015
Thirty-five-year-old female,
restrained driver, five-car pile-up.

178
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,617
Thirty-four weeks
pregnant. Pulse is 120.

179
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:56,091
Complaining of abdominal pain.

180
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:59,410
My kids, and... Oh, God.
Omar Singh, my husband?

181
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,612
Okay, we'll take
care of them and you.

182
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:02,981
I promise. What's your name?

183
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:04,515
Gretchen McKay.

184
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:06,379
Thirty-six-year-old
male, Omar Singh,

185
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:09,003
unrestrained passenger,
hemodynamically unstable,

186
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:12,040
GCS at 11, obvious
abdominal and chest contusions.

187
00:08:12,109 --> 00:08:13,674
Sir, can you follow my light?

188
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:16,227
I barely have a pulse.

189
00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:17,629
You said he was unrestrained?

190
00:08:17,698 --> 00:08:19,709
Yeah, family of five in the
car. Three kids in the backseat.

191
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:21,844
Dad got T-boned on the
side and took the brunt of it.

192
00:08:21,868 --> 00:08:23,702
We need to get
him inside right now.

193
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:25,982
Okay, Gretchen, I see you're
holding your belly pretty tight there.

194
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:27,332
You hurting? GRETCHEN: Yes.

195
00:08:27,356 --> 00:08:28,589
Don't be scared.

196
00:08:28,658 --> 00:08:29,857
We got you now, okay?

197
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:32,326
Yeah. Come on. Let's go.

198
00:08:32,395 --> 00:08:33,622
All right, you guys go.

199
00:08:33,646 --> 00:08:35,013
I'm gonna wait for the kids.

200
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:36,321
Karev! I need you!

201
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:37,710
Chief, I've got a
situation upstairs.

202
00:08:37,734 --> 00:08:38,995
I've got a situation right here.

203
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:40,259
No, it's a possible Code Pink.

204
00:08:41,772 --> 00:08:42,988
You sure?

205
00:08:43,757 --> 00:08:45,707
Hey, Grey!

206
00:08:45,776 --> 00:08:47,492
Got a possible
Code Pink. Can you?

207
00:08:47,561 --> 00:08:48,776
I got it. Go.

208
00:08:51,431 --> 00:08:53,059
Okay, clear a path, people!

209
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:54,426
Coming through. Watch out.

210
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:55,911
Dr. Warren thought it
was a delayed abruption

211
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:56,963
from the car accident.

212
00:08:56,987 --> 00:08:58,719
Is Robbins in the
OR? Is she ready?

213
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:00,500
She needs to be scrubbed
when we get there.

214
00:09:00,524 --> 00:09:02,741
I know. I paged her. She
hasn't stopped bleeding.

215
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:04,449
I can't tell if it's
uterine atony or...

216
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:06,088
Keep shoving in
more packing, DeLuca.

217
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:08,491
I am. It's just... It's coming
out faster than it's going in.

218
00:09:08,515 --> 00:09:10,059
How long's she been hypotensive?

219
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:11,949
Uh, at first she was
fine, then she just...

220
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:13,318
How long?

221
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:14,680
Maybe five or six
minutes before you arrived.

222
00:09:14,704 --> 00:09:16,955
I'm not sure. You need
to get sure, DeLuca.

223
00:09:17,024 --> 00:09:18,167
I'm gonna ask you again.

224
00:09:18,191 --> 00:09:20,511
How long since her
pressure bottomed out?

225
00:09:22,011 --> 00:09:23,678
I'm sorry.

226
00:09:23,747 --> 00:09:26,981
Sweetie, never do that again.

227
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:30,985
I was scared about the perit...

228
00:09:31,054 --> 00:09:33,104
The peritonsillar abscess?

229
00:09:33,172 --> 00:09:34,439
Look, don't be.

230
00:09:34,508 --> 00:09:35,840
You've got this, buddy.

231
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:37,353
Once I get in there
and fix your throat,

232
00:09:37,377 --> 00:09:38,988
you're gonna feel
so much better.

233
00:09:39,012 --> 00:09:40,356
You're gonna be eating ice cream

234
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,441
and sliding down the
rails of those stairs.

235
00:09:42,465 --> 00:09:44,332
And riding the elevator?

236
00:09:44,401 --> 00:09:46,100
Sure, whatever you want.

237
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:47,746
Just no more running away, okay?

238
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:50,516
It scares your mom, and I
need to know where you are

239
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:51,940
at all times.

240
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:55,088
I'm sorry. I need to go
check on something.

241
00:09:59,883 --> 00:10:01,494
Hey, do you know what happened?

242
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:03,963
I just heard that Gretchen
McKay needs a crash-c.

243
00:10:03,987 --> 00:10:05,931
Okay, you should tell the
NICU that the baby's coming.

244
00:10:05,955 --> 00:10:07,083
Arizona. If she's lost blood,

245
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:08,807
then the baby's lost even more.

246
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:10,185
Has she even been cross-matched?
The crash-c already happened.

247
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:11,259
What?

248
00:10:13,847 --> 00:10:16,147
He's not oxygenating.

249
00:10:16,216 --> 00:10:17,898
Page cardio and neuro. Okay.

250
00:10:17,985 --> 00:10:19,384
How old is this baby?

251
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:20,529
How far along was she?

252
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:24,022
Thirty-two, no,
34 weeks, I think.

253
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:25,902
You think? Was she preeclamptic?

254
00:10:25,926 --> 00:10:27,258
Diabetic?

255
00:10:27,327 --> 00:10:29,538
Was there evidence of
an abruption or a previa?

256
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:31,129
No, no, I mean, yeah.

257
00:10:31,198 --> 00:10:33,364
It was a delayed
abruption, or seemed to be.

258
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:34,666
She was hypotensive...

259
00:10:34,735 --> 00:10:36,662
History of Rh incompatibility?
Talk to me, Warren.

260
00:10:36,686 --> 00:10:39,136
I need to know what
I'm dealing with here.

261
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:41,868
All right, I need some
retractors here, Kocher clamps.

262
00:10:41,892 --> 00:10:43,742
I can't see a damn thing.

263
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,321
Now! APRIL: Keep
the laps coming.

264
00:10:45,345 --> 00:10:46,678
Come on, I need more laps now.

265
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:48,541
Is she... Is she gonna make it?

266
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:50,015
Be quiet. Suction.

267
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:52,417
I'm trying to
get you visibility.

268
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:53,701
You got this?

269
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:55,331
Okay. Retract there. - On it.

270
00:10:55,355 --> 00:10:56,787
Robbins, do you have this?

271
00:10:56,857 --> 00:10:59,257
No, Bailey! No. I
do not have this.

272
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:02,221
Now, stop talking to me so I
can concentrate on getting it.

273
00:11:02,245 --> 00:11:03,485
Who did this?

274
00:11:15,358 --> 00:11:18,859
Is my baby gonna die?

275
00:11:18,929 --> 00:11:20,428
Crap. He's bradying down.

276
00:11:20,496 --> 00:11:21,695
The mom abrupted.

277
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:23,197
She needed an
emergent C-section.

278
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:24,927
In the middle of the hallway?
What the hell happened?

279
00:11:24,951 --> 00:11:26,562
You have to understand, I
would have lost them both.

280
00:11:26,586 --> 00:11:28,053
Well, now we might anyway.

281
00:11:28,121 --> 00:11:29,198
Send for an ABG now.

282
00:11:29,222 --> 00:11:30,338
Okay, what else can I do?

283
00:11:30,406 --> 00:11:31,734
Nothing. Just...
Just stand there.

284
00:11:31,758 --> 00:11:33,540
No, I want to help.

285
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:36,010
Dr. Warren, I need to
speak with you, privately.

286
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:37,573
When the baby's
stable, I'll find you.

287
00:11:37,597 --> 00:11:39,764
I need to stay.
I need to assist.

288
00:11:39,816 --> 00:11:41,866
We need to increase the
frequency to 600 BPMs,

289
00:11:41,935 --> 00:11:42,967
and set the IT to 33%...

290
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:46,237
Dr. Warren, I'm not
asking. Come with me.

291
00:11:46,305 --> 00:11:47,905
Right now.

292
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:02,319
Look, she was hypotensive.
She was bottoming out.

293
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:03,933
She... Stop talking!

294
00:12:03,957 --> 00:12:06,758
Do not tell me a single thing.

295
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:07,859
Nothing.

296
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:09,043
I am the chief of surgery.

297
00:12:09,111 --> 00:12:11,212
Every single thing you
tell me I have to use.

298
00:12:11,281 --> 00:12:13,247
So, do not speak, got it?

299
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:15,783
Yeah.

300
00:12:15,852 --> 00:12:18,552
Just stay right
here in this office.

301
00:12:18,621 --> 00:12:20,822
Don't come out.
Don't talk to anyone.

302
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:23,124
Just wait for me to come back.

303
00:12:24,593 --> 00:12:25,638
One thing. Benjamin!

304
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:27,645
How is Gretchen?

305
00:12:27,713 --> 00:12:30,448
Not one word.

306
00:12:58,912 --> 00:13:01,079
Edwards, I could use
some traction here.

307
00:13:01,148 --> 00:13:02,268
Nice work, Grey.

308
00:13:02,332 --> 00:13:04,065
Balloon catheter. Good idea.

309
00:13:04,133 --> 00:13:06,350
We almost did a
thoracotomy in the ER.

310
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:07,779
Yeah, this bought us some time.

311
00:13:07,803 --> 00:13:11,672
No, I mean, we almost got
to do a thoracotomy in the ER,

312
00:13:11,741 --> 00:13:13,691
which, you know, would
have been amazing.

313
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,970
They must have
found the kid, right?

314
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:16,472
You think he was
hiding somewhere?

315
00:13:16,496 --> 00:13:18,023
'Cause, I mean, how many
times do you get to operate

316
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:19,447
outside the operating room?

317
00:13:19,516 --> 00:13:22,116
Okay, for the record, it
sounds fun until you do it.

318
00:13:23,319 --> 00:13:24,452
Grey.

319
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,621
Gretchen McKay. How's she doing?

320
00:13:26,689 --> 00:13:30,491
Uh, well, she just had an emergency
C-section performed by a resident.

321
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,443
What? She was
fine when I left her.

322
00:13:32,512 --> 00:13:34,279
Okay, well, that's
what I'm asking.

323
00:13:34,347 --> 00:13:38,533
Your name is listed as the
attending, so, why did you leave her?

324
00:13:38,601 --> 00:13:41,001
Uh, well, I just did
the initial trauma eval,

325
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,520
and then I got pulled
into her husband's room.

326
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:45,223
It was Robbins' case.

327
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:50,478
But, I handed her off to you,
and you left her with Robbins?

328
00:13:50,547 --> 00:13:52,230
No, I left her with Warren.

329
00:13:52,299 --> 00:13:54,199
Did Warren do
the C-section, or...

330
00:13:54,267 --> 00:13:55,916
Just tell me what happened.

331
00:13:59,071 --> 00:14:00,850
Gretchen McKay,
34 weeks pregnant.

332
00:14:00,874 --> 00:14:02,540
No sign of abdominal trauma.

333
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:04,825
She does need an OB
consult. Where's Robbins?

334
00:14:04,894 --> 00:14:05,993
On her way. How can I...

335
00:14:06,061 --> 00:14:08,712
You can help DeLuca
get her off this board.

336
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:11,249
Omar wasn't
wearing his seat belt.

337
00:14:11,318 --> 00:14:14,652
Spencer dropped a book.
Omar reached back to get it.

338
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,832
Okay, he's right next
door being checked out.

339
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:20,358
The car in front just stopped.

340
00:14:20,427 --> 00:14:22,138
I hit the brakes.

341
00:14:22,162 --> 00:14:24,273
Her BP's dropping. Okay,
Warren, what do we do?

342
00:14:24,297 --> 00:14:25,780
DeLuca, move.

343
00:14:25,848 --> 00:14:27,660
Uh, third trimester can't
always tolerate supine position.

344
00:14:27,684 --> 00:14:28,916
Puts pressure on her IVC,

345
00:14:28,985 --> 00:14:31,135
so, we roll her
to her left and...

346
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:33,932
Okay.

347
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:36,357
There you go. BP's back up.

348
00:14:36,426 --> 00:14:38,025
Good job.

349
00:14:38,094 --> 00:14:39,955
All right. Gretchen,
are you comfortable?

350
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:41,728
My kids... How are my kids?

351
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:43,225
I'll have someone
find out, okay?

352
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:44,816
They're fine. They're fine.

353
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,111
Jasmine has a
bit of a stiff neck,

354
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:47,918
and Trevor's just
a little nervous,

355
00:14:47,987 --> 00:14:51,122
but Spencer has two loose front
teeth that he can't stop wiggling, but...

356
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,667
Those were loose before...

357
00:14:52,691 --> 00:14:55,309
"Before today." Yeah,
that's what he said.

358
00:14:55,378 --> 00:14:57,244
Don't worry. We got them.

359
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:58,763
Thank you.

360
00:14:58,831 --> 00:15:01,900
Grey! We need an extra
set of hands over here!

361
00:15:01,968 --> 00:15:04,335
Okay, I'll be right there!

362
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:06,854
That's my husband. That's
my husband next door.

363
00:15:06,922 --> 00:15:09,322
Okay, so, I will go
check on him for you.

364
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:12,560
Robbins will be by to scan her
and admit her for observation.

365
00:15:12,629 --> 00:15:13,673
Are you okay here?

366
00:15:13,697 --> 00:15:15,497
Yes. Go. Okay.

367
00:15:17,133 --> 00:15:18,783
<i>Did you ask him?</i>

368
00:15:18,852 --> 00:15:21,385
Did you ask him if he was good,

369
00:15:21,454 --> 00:15:23,749
or did he tell you he was good?

370
00:15:23,773 --> 00:15:25,573
Bailey, he was fine.

371
00:15:25,642 --> 00:15:27,386
But you didn't even
wait for Robbins.

372
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:29,054
How do you even
know she got there?

373
00:15:29,078 --> 00:15:31,412
Dr. Bailey, I saw Robbins.

374
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:36,367
What do we got?

375
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:39,019
Okay. Abdomen is
tense and distended.

376
00:15:39,088 --> 00:15:40,571
His belly's full of blood.

377
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,939
Pressure's 60 over 40.

378
00:15:42,008 --> 00:15:44,169
Edwards, let's prep
for a thoracotomy.

379
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:47,995
Oh, my G... Uh, okay. Okay.

380
00:15:48,064 --> 00:15:49,842
Edwards, what if we
did a balloon catheter?

381
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:52,967
<i>Robbins was in there. I saw her.</i>

382
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:54,685
You saw her?

383
00:15:54,754 --> 00:15:57,521
I did.

384
00:15:57,590 --> 00:16:01,259
I mean, so, how is
she? Is the baby okay?

385
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:02,526
Bailey?

386
00:16:12,505 --> 00:16:14,817
I heard there was
blood on the walls,

387
00:16:14,841 --> 00:16:16,207
and the ceiling.

388
00:16:16,276 --> 00:16:17,769
Well, you know how
amputations bleed.

389
00:16:17,793 --> 00:16:19,254
You hit the femoral
at just the right angle,

390
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:20,598
and it's...

391
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:21,924
Amputations? Mmm-hmm.

392
00:16:21,948 --> 00:16:23,759
I heard he cut into
some lady in a hallway.

393
00:16:23,783 --> 00:16:26,517
No, I heard he cut the leg
off of some lady in an elevator.

394
00:16:26,586 --> 00:16:27,918
Below-knee. Very clean cut.

395
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,165
That doesn't even make sense.

396
00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:31,069
What the hell are you two doing?

397
00:16:31,124 --> 00:16:32,206
This isn't a movie.

398
00:16:32,275 --> 00:16:34,395
Dr. Warren is not here
for your entertainment.

399
00:16:34,443 --> 00:16:35,994
What is this?

400
00:16:36,062 --> 00:16:38,145
Concessions?

401
00:16:38,214 --> 00:16:39,741
I, um... I apologize.
Sorry, Dr. Torres.

402
00:16:39,765 --> 00:16:41,232
Why are you still here?

403
00:16:41,301 --> 00:16:42,766
You heard her. Scram.

404
00:16:55,799 --> 00:16:56,831
What's that?

405
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,432
Oh. It's... It's nothing.

406
00:16:58,501 --> 00:17:00,712
I was holding on
to it for Gretchen.

407
00:17:00,736 --> 00:17:02,136
Her kid lost a tooth.

408
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,007
Okay. I need to know
everything. Yes, Chief.

409
00:17:07,076 --> 00:17:09,977
I need to know what
you two were doing.

410
00:17:10,045 --> 00:17:13,080
I need to know exactly how
and exactly why this happened.

411
00:17:13,149 --> 00:17:14,192
Yes, Chief.

412
00:17:14,216 --> 00:17:15,443
Look, her scans all look clear.

413
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:17,401
I know. We thought so, too.

414
00:17:23,343 --> 00:17:25,076
We're done? Already?

415
00:17:25,145 --> 00:17:27,678
Yep. You did great.

416
00:17:27,747 --> 00:17:29,313
Scans look clear, Gretchen.

417
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:32,549
Good, then, can we get my kids?

418
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:34,896
I'm sure the boys are destroying
the emergency room by now.

419
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,954
One, two, three...

420
00:17:37,022 --> 00:17:40,023
Yeah, well, let's
get you up in OB,

421
00:17:40,093 --> 00:17:42,193
and then we'll bring
them up to you, all right?

422
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:43,510
Let's roll her.

423
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,317
You cold?

424
00:17:50,386 --> 00:17:51,569
Maybe a little.

425
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:54,221
Okay, I'll get you
another blanket, all right?

426
00:17:58,427 --> 00:18:00,305
Can you find out
about my husband?

427
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:01,995
Yeah, absolutely.

428
00:18:02,865 --> 00:18:04,698
You okay? You comfortable?

429
00:18:04,767 --> 00:18:09,020
It's just... My stomach hurts
one way, my back hurts another.

430
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:12,223
You know, let's...
Let's stop for a sec.

431
00:18:12,292 --> 00:18:13,735
I'm gonna prop you up
a little more, all right?

432
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,599
DeLuca, grab a pillow. Yeah.

433
00:18:17,213 --> 00:18:18,362
There you go.

434
00:18:20,667 --> 00:18:21,966
Is that better?

435
00:18:22,034 --> 00:18:23,684
Yeah, it's...

436
00:18:23,752 --> 00:18:25,252
Oh. No. My stomach hurts.

437
00:18:29,542 --> 00:18:31,659
Oh, it's just...

438
00:18:31,727 --> 00:18:33,878
I don't feel so good.

439
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:35,157
<i>Her pulse was a little high.</i>

440
00:18:35,181 --> 00:18:36,580
<i>She was clammy and shivering.</i>

441
00:18:36,649 --> 00:18:38,565
<i>So, Dr. Warren made a call.</i>

442
00:18:38,634 --> 00:18:40,378
You know what? We're
gonna get you up to OB

443
00:18:40,402 --> 00:18:41,513
and call Dr. Robbins, okay?

444
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:42,937
Okay. This way.

445
00:18:44,974 --> 00:18:47,041
She's hypotensive.

446
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:48,276
Ow!

447
00:18:48,344 --> 00:18:49,554
Gretchen, you're doing great.

448
00:18:49,578 --> 00:18:51,418
You're doing great. We
have to get her up to...

449
00:18:53,016 --> 00:18:55,215
All right. I got her.

450
00:18:55,284 --> 00:18:57,029
Hang in there. Almost there.

451
00:18:57,053 --> 00:18:58,780
I've lost the heartbeat.

452
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,498
What? DeLuca!

453
00:19:00,522 --> 00:19:03,307
Well, it might just be that
the transducer slipped.

454
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:04,675
Oh, it hurts!

455
00:19:04,743 --> 00:19:06,811
Yeah, I know. I
know. We are so close.

456
00:19:08,364 --> 00:19:10,592
Go. Get Robbins
or anybody from OB.

457
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:11,643
I'll take her up.

458
00:19:11,667 --> 00:19:12,894
By yourself? Go!

459
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:14,134
Okay.

460
00:19:14,203 --> 00:19:15,714
Okay, Gretchen, as soon
as the elevator gets here,

461
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:17,938
we're gonna take you up
and take care of you, all right?

462
00:19:18,874 --> 00:19:20,073
Oh, no.

463
00:19:21,377 --> 00:19:24,044
Go! Go faster! Right now! Go!

464
00:19:24,113 --> 00:19:25,312
What the hell?

465
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,831
They... They're locked.

466
00:19:27,884 --> 00:19:29,149
Go, go, go, go, go!

467
00:19:32,572 --> 00:19:33,812
They're all locked!

468
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:35,750
We were trapped in there.

469
00:19:35,774 --> 00:19:37,702
Okay, we waited for
someone to come, but...

470
00:19:37,726 --> 00:19:40,378
And she was... She was crashing.

471
00:19:40,446 --> 00:19:42,213
We were gonna lose them both.

472
00:19:42,282 --> 00:19:44,282
All right? There
wasn't a choice.

473
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:48,635
And you're certain of that?

474
00:19:50,423 --> 00:19:51,788
Yeah.

475
00:19:56,595 --> 00:19:58,712
That's what Dr. Warren said.

476
00:20:15,114 --> 00:20:17,447
They put the McKay
baby on an oscillator.

477
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:19,250
It was hard to watch.

478
00:20:19,318 --> 00:20:21,551
So little, doesn't
have a name yet.

479
00:20:25,124 --> 00:20:26,757
Warren didn't come out yet?

480
00:20:26,826 --> 00:20:29,243
No. No one's gone in, either.

481
00:20:29,312 --> 00:20:31,190
At least, not since
we've been here.

482
00:20:31,214 --> 00:20:33,626
I just don't know why he
did it. Why didn't he wait?

483
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:35,570
Well, I guess he thought
he didn't have a choice.

484
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,196
They didn't know how
long they'd be stuck there.

485
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,419
Damn it.

486
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:41,055
NICU.

487
00:20:41,124 --> 00:20:42,890
Thanks for the chip.

488
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,593
Still, though. In a hallway?

489
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:47,227
Look, I get it.

490
00:20:47,296 --> 00:20:49,007
We almost opened up
the husband in trauma,

491
00:20:49,031 --> 00:20:51,471
and it was all I wanted to do.

492
00:20:53,268 --> 00:20:56,036
Surgery is a drug.

493
00:20:56,105 --> 00:20:58,105
And operating outside the OR?

494
00:20:58,173 --> 00:21:00,324
That is mainlining.

495
00:21:00,393 --> 00:21:01,725
But, he's a level head.

496
00:21:01,794 --> 00:21:03,727
He's Gramps.

497
00:21:03,796 --> 00:21:05,173
We are talking about
the same person

498
00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:07,542
who used a clipboard
to slice open a patient

499
00:21:07,566 --> 00:21:09,232
in the psych ward.

500
00:21:09,302 --> 00:21:10,851
Gramps goes rogue.

501
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,586
What do you think
will happen to him?

502
00:21:12,654 --> 00:21:13,894
I don't know.

503
00:21:13,956 --> 00:21:15,055
If it was us?

504
00:21:15,124 --> 00:21:17,458
Yeah. He's married to the chief.

505
00:21:18,327 --> 00:21:19,793
Maybe he's invincible.

506
00:21:19,862 --> 00:21:20,894
Mmm.

507
00:21:21,597 --> 00:21:22,680
Yeah.

508
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:24,693
Sir. Oh.

509
00:21:24,717 --> 00:21:25,916
Hi. Oh.

510
00:21:26,552 --> 00:21:27,701
Doctors.

511
00:21:36,362 --> 00:21:38,228
Diffuse loss of muscle tone.

512
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:39,730
I can't get him to oxygenate.

513
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:41,031
He needs to go on ECMO.

514
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,544
You think this little
guy can handle that?

515
00:21:42,568 --> 00:21:43,667
No.

516
00:21:43,735 --> 00:21:45,380
Neither do I, but it's
the only chance he has.

517
00:21:45,404 --> 00:21:46,753
Sats are in the 80s.

518
00:21:49,926 --> 00:21:51,392
I'm with you. Do it.

519
00:21:55,898 --> 00:21:58,582
We need parental consent.
Where are the parents?

520
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:01,084
Mom's in OR 1, Dad's in OR 2.

521
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:02,393
Just go ahead and do it.

522
00:22:16,268 --> 00:22:17,713
The uterine
arteries are clamped,

523
00:22:17,737 --> 00:22:18,997
but there's still
blood everywhere.

524
00:22:19,021 --> 00:22:20,666
She's not clotting.
She's in DIC.

525
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:22,467
Order eight more
units of blood and FFP.

526
00:22:22,491 --> 00:22:23,602
Well, how's she doing?

527
00:22:23,626 --> 00:22:24,975
Good. Bailey, where's Warren?

528
00:22:25,044 --> 00:22:26,739
I want to talk to him.
What the hell happened?

529
00:22:26,763 --> 00:22:28,107
Well, that's what
I want to know.

530
00:22:28,131 --> 00:22:30,464
Grey handed this patient
off to you in the ER.

531
00:22:30,533 --> 00:22:32,032
Yeah. Suction.

532
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,145
And then DeLuca said they
got stuck, and then they had to...

533
00:22:34,169 --> 00:22:35,864
Well, where were you
when all this happened?

534
00:22:35,888 --> 00:22:37,499
Hang another two units
of blood on the Level 1.

535
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:39,067
The suction's
not working. Fix it.

536
00:22:39,091 --> 00:22:40,141
Robbins.

537
00:22:40,209 --> 00:22:42,437
Um, I had Warren take her to CT.

538
00:22:42,461 --> 00:22:44,261
Well, why didn't you take her?

539
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:45,962
What were you doing?

540
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:48,748
I don't even know,
Bailey. She was stable.

541
00:22:48,817 --> 00:22:50,812
A resident can take
a stable patient to CT.

542
00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:52,514
Well, not when her
fetus is in distress.

543
00:22:52,538 --> 00:22:53,937
You think a resident should...

544
00:22:54,006 --> 00:22:56,607
Bailey, they were both stable
when I left them with Warren!

545
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:03,563
Gretchen, good news.

546
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:05,894
Your baby is great.
The heartbeat is strong.

547
00:23:05,918 --> 00:23:07,379
There's no signs
of any problems.

548
00:23:07,403 --> 00:23:09,720
Hang in there, Cosmo.

549
00:23:09,789 --> 00:23:10,821
Cosmo?

550
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:12,735
Yeah, that won't
be his real name,

551
00:23:12,759 --> 00:23:15,704
but it's what we're calling
him till he gets here.

552
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:19,396
Omar had this really boring partner
dinner that I agreed to go to, because...

553
00:23:19,465 --> 00:23:21,732
Hello. Night out
like a grown-up.

554
00:23:21,801 --> 00:23:24,434
And three cosmopolitans later...

555
00:23:24,503 --> 00:23:25,669
Baby on board.

556
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:28,188
Aww. Yikes.

557
00:23:28,257 --> 00:23:30,619
Gretchen, your husband's on
his way up to surgery right now,

558
00:23:30,643 --> 00:23:33,009
but, uh, I have
a visitor for you.

559
00:23:35,865 --> 00:23:37,825
Come here, peanut.

560
00:23:39,184 --> 00:23:40,234
Are you okay?

561
00:23:40,302 --> 00:23:43,270
Yeah. Are you?

562
00:23:43,339 --> 00:23:45,872
Spencer's tooth
came out, one of them.

563
00:23:45,941 --> 00:23:48,008
He wants you to see it.

564
00:23:48,077 --> 00:23:49,676
Huh.

565
00:23:49,745 --> 00:23:51,912
Did he pull it out, or did you?

566
00:23:51,981 --> 00:23:53,330
I helped.

567
00:23:53,399 --> 00:23:54,877
Mmm-hmm.

568
00:23:54,901 --> 00:23:57,617
All right, we'll get you to
CT first and then up to OB.

569
00:23:57,687 --> 00:23:59,164
Uh, the kids can meet you there.

570
00:23:59,188 --> 00:24:01,499
Oh, DeLuca, do you mind
finding something to put that in?

571
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:02,884
Yeah. Thanks.

572
00:24:02,908 --> 00:24:05,041
Okay, just a few more minutes.

573
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,543
Hang in there.

574
00:24:06,612 --> 00:24:08,223
And, Jasmine, you're in charge.

575
00:24:08,247 --> 00:24:11,031
Okay, just keep your hands
out of your brother's mouth.

576
00:24:15,904 --> 00:24:17,337
Okay.

577
00:24:17,406 --> 00:24:18,522
So, take her up to CT

578
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:19,868
and then let me know
when the scans are up.

579
00:24:19,892 --> 00:24:21,492
Mmm-hmm. Okay.

580
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:24,773
She was fine when I left her.

581
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:25,874
Oh-chromic.

582
00:24:25,898 --> 00:24:26,975
Besides, it's Warren.

583
00:24:26,999 --> 00:24:28,231
Clamp.

584
00:24:28,301 --> 00:24:29,828
What do you mean, "It's Warren?"

585
00:24:29,852 --> 00:24:31,213
I mean, if there was
any resident I'd want

586
00:24:31,237 --> 00:24:32,681
to do an emergency
C-section, it would be Warren.

587
00:24:32,705 --> 00:24:34,772
He's good.

588
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,990
He has done them before.

589
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:38,636
If he said he had
to, I believe him.

590
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:40,238
He had to. He saved her life.

591
00:24:40,262 --> 00:24:41,612
All right, be quiet!

592
00:24:46,152 --> 00:24:47,351
Basin.

593
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:04,168
Suction.

594
00:25:11,994 --> 00:25:13,060
Here.

595
00:25:24,657 --> 00:25:25,805
Robbins.

596
00:25:30,963 --> 00:25:32,429
Okay, DeLuca, start CPR.

597
00:25:53,085 --> 00:25:54,451
You can stop now.

598
00:25:55,737 --> 00:25:57,288
Stop, DeLuca.

599
00:26:01,577 --> 00:26:02,643
Come on.

600
00:26:04,146 --> 00:26:06,191
Come on. ARIZONA: I said stop!

601
00:26:23,899 --> 00:26:25,949
Time of death, 17:02.

602
00:26:50,693 --> 00:26:52,125
The dad made it.

603
00:26:53,712 --> 00:26:55,045
The mom didn't.

604
00:27:00,902 --> 00:27:02,603
I hate it when it's babies.

605
00:27:06,141 --> 00:27:07,441
Me too.

606
00:28:23,703 --> 00:28:28,572
Um, Dr. Webber, I wanted to
talk to you about Benjamin Warren.

607
00:28:29,575 --> 00:28:30,815
Yeah, I thought you might.

608
00:28:30,843 --> 00:28:33,643
Yeah, well, as head of
the residency program,

609
00:28:33,713 --> 00:28:36,046
I thought disciplinary action
would be more appropriate

610
00:28:36,115 --> 00:28:37,915
coming from you.

611
00:28:38,951 --> 00:28:40,696
Thank you. I see.

612
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,652
Yeah, I mean, nothing
too harsh, of course,

613
00:28:42,722 --> 00:28:45,789
but, substantial enough.

614
00:28:46,692 --> 00:28:47,758
Whatever you think.

615
00:28:47,827 --> 00:28:49,659
Whatever I think. Yes, sir.

616
00:28:49,729 --> 00:28:50,744
No.

617
00:28:51,814 --> 00:28:52,979
Excuse me?

618
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:54,208
I can't do that.

619
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:55,977
I can't take this
out of your hands.

620
00:28:56,001 --> 00:28:57,317
Oh, sir...

621
00:28:57,386 --> 00:28:58,930
A surgical resident
could be responsible

622
00:28:58,954 --> 00:29:01,266
for the death of
two patients today.

623
00:29:01,290 --> 00:29:03,690
I'm not the chief anymore.
This is above my jurisdiction.

624
00:29:03,758 --> 00:29:05,803
Oh, come on. Especially
if we're dealing with

625
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:08,345
a resident who's out of control.

626
00:29:08,414 --> 00:29:11,965
Don't... Ben isn't a danger.

627
00:29:12,033 --> 00:29:13,650
How do you know that?

628
00:29:13,719 --> 00:29:14,984
Are you sure?

629
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:18,600
Was this a mistake,
or was it hubris?

630
00:29:18,624 --> 00:29:21,474
Did he do his job,
or did he overstep?

631
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:28,465
Bailey, I know it's hard
being his wife and his boss,

632
00:29:28,533 --> 00:29:30,567
but you're the chief now.

633
00:29:30,636 --> 00:29:32,586
This is your call.

634
00:29:32,655 --> 00:29:34,921
It's your job.

635
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:36,456
Do your job.

636
00:29:48,821 --> 00:29:53,306
Hey, just wanted to see
how you're holding up.

637
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:56,092
I'm not.

638
00:29:56,161 --> 00:29:58,261
Look, she was dying,
and I'm telling you,

639
00:29:58,330 --> 00:29:59,775
I did the right
thing... No, no, no, no.

640
00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:02,332
You probably should not be
telling me any of this, right?

641
00:30:03,552 --> 00:30:05,485
Right. Of course. Um...

642
00:30:07,689 --> 00:30:08,889
Okay, um...

643
00:30:10,659 --> 00:30:11,659
How are you doing?

644
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:20,016
All right. Ten minutes.

645
00:30:20,085 --> 00:30:22,068
What? You got 10 minutes.

646
00:30:22,137 --> 00:30:24,382
Anything you tell me in those
10 minutes you never told me.

647
00:30:24,406 --> 00:30:26,051
You got 10 minutes, and I'm out.

648
00:30:26,075 --> 00:30:27,357
I was never here.

649
00:30:28,944 --> 00:30:30,277
Go.

650
00:30:31,813 --> 00:30:33,313
Look, I didn't want to do it.

651
00:30:33,382 --> 00:30:35,393
I was out of options.
She was crashing.

652
00:30:35,417 --> 00:30:36,816
She got hypotensive.

653
00:30:36,885 --> 00:30:39,125
It was the only
way I could help her.

654
00:30:41,556 --> 00:30:43,468
<i>We lost the baby's heartbeat.</i>

655
00:30:43,492 --> 00:30:44,808
Oh, it hurts!

656
00:30:44,877 --> 00:30:46,871
Yeah, I know. I
know. We are so close.

657
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:50,525
Go. Get Robbins
or anybody from OB.

658
00:30:50,549 --> 00:30:51,610
I'll take her up.

659
00:30:51,634 --> 00:30:52,694
By yourself? Go!

660
00:30:52,718 --> 00:30:53,934
Okay.

661
00:30:54,002 --> 00:30:55,379
Okay, Gretchen, as soon
as the elevator gets here,

662
00:30:55,403 --> 00:30:57,132
we're gonna take you up
and take care of you, all right?

663
00:30:57,156 --> 00:30:59,217
<i>She was crashing.</i>

664
00:30:59,241 --> 00:31:00,451
Oh, no. No, no, no!

665
00:31:00,475 --> 00:31:02,653
Go! Go faster! Now! Go!

666
00:31:02,677 --> 00:31:04,717
What's happening?
They... They're locked.

667
00:31:05,397 --> 00:31:06,846
Go, go, go, go, go!

668
00:31:08,049 --> 00:31:09,549
No, no, no, no, no.

669
00:31:11,186 --> 00:31:13,020
They're all locked.

670
00:31:13,088 --> 00:31:14,504
Start paging people right now.

671
00:31:14,573 --> 00:31:15,922
Robbins, Karev, Hunt, anybody.

672
00:31:15,991 --> 00:31:18,158
Just tell them we're
trapped down here.

673
00:31:18,226 --> 00:31:20,237
It's gonna be just a
minute longer, okay?

674
00:31:20,261 --> 00:31:23,280
Now, hang on. I am
taking care of you.

675
00:31:23,349 --> 00:31:25,449
Dr. Warren. Yeah?

676
00:31:25,517 --> 00:31:27,517
Dr. Warren.

677
00:31:27,586 --> 00:31:28,763
I'm right here,
Gretchen, all right?

678
00:31:28,787 --> 00:31:30,598
I'm not going
anywhere, I promise.

679
00:31:30,622 --> 00:31:32,400
We're gonna have to
wait it out a little longer.

680
00:31:32,424 --> 00:31:34,624
I know, but...

681
00:31:34,692 --> 00:31:36,075
Is my baby gonna die?

682
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:41,131
I told her no.

683
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:53,627
No fevers.

684
00:31:53,695 --> 00:31:54,805
Bandages look good.

685
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:56,896
You guys are superstars.

686
00:32:00,953 --> 00:32:03,453
Uh, hey, guys,
say hi to Dr. Bailey.

687
00:32:06,091 --> 00:32:09,809
I just, uh, wanted to
see if you settled in.

688
00:32:09,878 --> 00:32:12,429
You guys are
staying here tonight,

689
00:32:12,497 --> 00:32:14,647
like a little slumber party.

690
00:32:15,583 --> 00:32:17,495
Uh, in the morning,
you can pick out

691
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:19,680
your own breakfast
in the cafeteria.

692
00:32:19,704 --> 00:32:21,571
Where are Mom and Dad?

693
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:24,891
They're... They're upstairs.

694
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:28,094
Dr. Bailey, can I talk to you?

695
00:32:28,163 --> 00:32:29,646
Sure.

696
00:32:36,855 --> 00:32:38,288
I'm in charge now.

697
00:32:39,474 --> 00:32:40,924
You can tell me the truth.

698
00:32:43,095 --> 00:32:44,961
Jasmine...

699
00:32:46,564 --> 00:32:50,199
Well, your dad
had a long surgery,

700
00:32:50,268 --> 00:32:55,171
so he's gonna be asleep
for a while, so he can heal.

701
00:32:56,775 --> 00:32:58,341
What about my mom?

702
00:33:00,712 --> 00:33:02,094
Did she die?

703
00:33:09,137 --> 00:33:10,704
I'm so sorry.

704
00:33:16,945 --> 00:33:18,377
I thought so.

705
00:33:23,118 --> 00:33:25,018
Trevor lost his tooth.

706
00:33:27,539 --> 00:33:29,572
Yeah, I... I heard.

707
00:33:29,641 --> 00:33:32,275
I have it here.

708
00:33:37,282 --> 00:33:39,149
Do you have any money?

709
00:33:41,186 --> 00:33:43,002
The tooth fairy's
supposed to come.

710
00:33:45,007 --> 00:33:46,072
Ah.

711
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:50,510
Um...

712
00:33:52,046 --> 00:33:53,580
Just... Here.

713
00:33:58,103 --> 00:33:59,502
Thanks.

714
00:34:22,995 --> 00:34:24,272
<i>Dr. Fields, medical records.</i>

715
00:34:24,296 --> 00:34:26,562
<i>Dr. Fields, medical records.</i>

716
00:34:33,254 --> 00:34:35,432
I have the damage
report for insurance.

717
00:34:35,456 --> 00:34:36,890
There was no damage.

718
00:34:36,958 --> 00:34:38,486
Which is what the report says.

719
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:40,092
Need your signature.

720
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:42,023
The PD's gonna want to know
who ordered the false alarm.

721
00:34:42,047 --> 00:34:44,681
Check to make sure your
name is spelled correctly.

722
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:48,051
There's X's next to every
place we need a signature.

723
00:34:49,688 --> 00:34:51,470
Chief?

724
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:53,580
Run that back. SECURITY
GUARD: Mmm-hmm.

725
00:35:00,482 --> 00:35:01,614
Miranda.

726
00:35:04,469 --> 00:35:05,735
Come here.

727
00:35:12,577 --> 00:35:13,843
Okay.

728
00:35:15,314 --> 00:35:18,714
So, I've spent the
day, trying to uncover

729
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:20,683
why you did what you did.

730
00:35:20,752 --> 00:35:25,055
I wanted to prove that you
were put in a position that...

731
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:27,924
No, I wanted to know
that you made the right call.

732
00:35:27,993 --> 00:35:29,570
Right. There was
no other call to make.

733
00:35:29,594 --> 00:35:31,027
I believed that.

734
00:35:31,095 --> 00:35:33,095
I wanted to believe that.

735
00:35:33,782 --> 00:35:35,115
The patient was dying.

736
00:35:35,183 --> 00:35:37,583
I made the decision
to save her life.

737
00:35:38,737 --> 00:35:41,387
You made a decision that
you didn't have to make.

738
00:35:41,456 --> 00:35:42,705
Yes, I did.

739
00:35:42,774 --> 00:35:44,335
You need to save
a life, you do it.

740
00:35:44,359 --> 00:35:46,593
No... You weren't there.

741
00:35:46,661 --> 00:35:47,927
No. I wasn't.

742
00:35:47,996 --> 00:35:49,674
Okay, so you cannot understand
what I was dealing with.

743
00:35:49,698 --> 00:35:50,930
Okay, then tell me.

744
00:35:50,999 --> 00:35:53,032
Tell me what happened
at the elevator.

745
00:35:53,101 --> 00:35:55,485
It's time for you
to talk to me now.

746
00:35:55,554 --> 00:35:57,821
All right. All right, the...

747
00:35:57,889 --> 00:36:01,273
The patient was in
distress, but she was lucid.

748
00:36:04,413 --> 00:36:07,163
Dr. Warren. Yeah?

749
00:36:07,232 --> 00:36:09,132
Dr. Warren.

750
00:36:09,201 --> 00:36:11,429
I'm right here, Gretchen, all right?
I'm not going anywhere, I promise.

751
00:36:11,453 --> 00:36:13,564
We're gonna have to
wait it out a little longer.

752
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:15,738
I know, but...

753
00:36:15,807 --> 00:36:17,474
Is my baby gonna die?

754
00:36:20,145 --> 00:36:21,310
No.

755
00:36:21,379 --> 00:36:23,529
No, we're just a
little stuck, that's all.

756
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:25,599
I really don't feel good.

757
00:36:25,667 --> 00:36:27,867
Yeah, I know. I know.

758
00:36:27,936 --> 00:36:30,403
Save the baby over
me, okay? Please.

759
00:36:30,472 --> 00:36:32,200
Gretchen, don't
say that. Don't say it.

760
00:36:32,224 --> 00:36:33,734
You just hold on a
little longer, okay?

761
00:36:33,758 --> 00:36:37,677
Please, I know you're
doing your best, but...

762
00:36:37,746 --> 00:36:39,178
Just in case.

763
00:36:39,247 --> 00:36:40,913
Gretchen, Gretchen, okay,

764
00:36:40,982 --> 00:36:42,393
you just keep on
breathing for me, okay?

765
00:36:42,417 --> 00:36:44,495
Gretchen, just rest and breathe.

766
00:36:44,519 --> 00:36:46,686
Gretchen. Gretchen.

767
00:36:49,907 --> 00:36:50,907
Gretchen.

768
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:53,393
DeLuca.

769
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:56,079
I need a crash cart or a
cut-down tray, anything.

770
00:36:56,147 --> 00:36:57,631
We got to wait for someone.

771
00:36:57,699 --> 00:36:59,344
She's bottoming out
right now, DeLuca.

772
00:36:59,368 --> 00:37:00,608
Find something! Go!

773
00:37:07,676 --> 00:37:08,875
DeLuca!

774
00:37:10,295 --> 00:37:11,461
I got it. I got it.

775
00:37:16,467 --> 00:37:18,279
What, you're gonna...
You're gonna cut her open?

776
00:37:18,303 --> 00:37:19,303
Here?

777
00:37:19,371 --> 00:37:21,687
Look, there isn't a choice.

778
00:37:22,824 --> 00:37:24,424
Her heart is about to stop.

779
00:37:24,493 --> 00:37:27,160
The minute it does, we
lose her and the baby.

780
00:37:27,246 --> 00:37:28,478
Okay.

781
00:37:30,799 --> 00:37:31,982
Open that cut-down tray.

782
00:37:32,034 --> 00:37:33,077
Okay.

783
00:37:33,101 --> 00:37:34,178
I paged.

784
00:37:34,202 --> 00:37:35,534
Someone is coming, okay?

785
00:37:35,603 --> 00:37:36,997
They can't get to us.
They can't get to us.

786
00:37:37,021 --> 00:37:38,971
We are in a lockdown.

787
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:41,857
And even if they come,
there's no more time.

788
00:37:43,695 --> 00:37:46,395
The doors were locked.
The elevator was closed.

789
00:37:46,464 --> 00:37:48,064
There was nothing else to do.

790
00:37:48,132 --> 00:37:49,933
You didn't know when
they were gonna open.

791
00:37:50,001 --> 00:37:52,697
Yeah. It could've been
seconds, or it could've been hours.

792
00:37:52,721 --> 00:37:54,120
I didn't have a choice.

793
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:55,922
You didn't have a choice.

794
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:21,631
<i>Hindsight is always 20/20.</i>

795
00:38:23,385 --> 00:38:24,750
What?

796
00:38:28,873 --> 00:38:31,274
I had to do it, to save her.

797
00:38:31,343 --> 00:38:33,442
There was no other option.

798
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:36,095
You understand that.

799
00:38:36,164 --> 00:38:37,530
Right?

800
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:40,900
<i>It's easy to figure out
what you should've done</i>

801
00:38:40,969 --> 00:38:42,701
<i>when you replay it.</i>

802
00:38:42,770 --> 00:38:45,138
I found something.

803
00:38:45,206 --> 00:38:48,591
<i>You see your mistakes, you
know how you'd correct them.</i>

804
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:53,663
So, the doors were locked. The
elevator wouldn't open. Mmm-hmm.

805
00:38:53,732 --> 00:38:55,347
Gretchen was unconscious,

806
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:58,584
and DeLuca found
a crash cart, right?

807
00:39:07,179 --> 00:39:09,629
<i>But that's the kicker, isn't it?</i>

808
00:39:09,697 --> 00:39:10,937
You were trapped.

809
00:39:10,965 --> 00:39:12,849
We were trapped.

810
00:39:13,518 --> 00:39:15,351
Hmm.

811
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:17,020
<i>You got ready to open her up.</i>

812
00:39:17,088 --> 00:39:19,589
<i>You lifted the scalpel.</i>

813
00:39:40,945 --> 00:39:42,278
You had a choice.

814
00:39:42,347 --> 00:39:45,598
No, no. No, no. That's not...
That's not what happened.

815
00:39:45,667 --> 00:39:47,801
I didn't know that the
doors had opened. I...

816
00:39:47,869 --> 00:39:49,597
Well, I'm looking
at it, and so are you.

817
00:39:49,621 --> 00:39:51,737
No, no. I don't care!
Look. I didn't know!

818
00:39:51,807 --> 00:39:54,974
No, you saw what
you wanted to see.

819
00:39:55,043 --> 00:39:56,871
You made a choice
that you wanted to make.

820
00:39:56,895 --> 00:39:58,861
Do you really believe that?

821
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:01,008
What else am I supposed to
believe? Oh, shut up with that!

822
00:40:01,032 --> 00:40:03,082
I am your damned husband!
