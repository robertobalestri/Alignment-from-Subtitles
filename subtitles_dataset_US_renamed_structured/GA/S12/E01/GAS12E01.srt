1
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:04,647
<i>Each of you comes
here today hopeful...</i>

2
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:06,483
<i>I have five rules.
Memorize them.</i>

3
00:00:06,507 --> 00:00:09,108
<i>Can anybody name...</i>

4
00:00:09,176 --> 00:00:10,820
<i>So, you might be thinking...</i>

5
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:13,125
<i>Rule number five,
when I move, you move.</i>

6
00:00:13,414 --> 00:00:14,813
<i>I've been here before.</i>

7
00:00:14,881 --> 00:00:16,025
<i>Trauma protocol...</i>

8
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:20,185
This is familiar.
This is old hat.

9
00:00:20,254 --> 00:00:22,721
<i>Maybe you're wondering
why are we here?</i>

10
00:00:23,824 --> 00:00:25,490
<i>But I promise</i>

11
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:28,793
<i>you're about to find out
that everything has changed.</i>

12
00:00:41,575 --> 00:00:43,675
What the hell are you doing?

13
00:00:43,744 --> 00:00:45,222
You want to
swing? It feels good.

14
00:00:45,246 --> 00:00:47,279
No! No, no, no! We
talked about this.

15
00:00:47,347 --> 00:00:49,497
No, we mused about it.
And then we went to bed.

16
00:00:49,566 --> 00:00:51,867
I think it's a great idea.
Let's open up the space.

17
00:00:51,935 --> 00:00:53,352
Get a little light in here.

18
00:00:54,487 --> 00:00:55,920
Or bad, it's a bad idea.

19
00:00:55,973 --> 00:00:58,841
Who wants open or
sun? Bad sun. I hate sun.

20
00:00:58,909 --> 00:01:01,443
I'm used to living with
someone who knows me,

21
00:01:01,511 --> 00:01:04,224
who knows not to change the
channel during the commercials,

22
00:01:04,248 --> 00:01:07,782
someone who knows not to
punch a hole in my living room wall.

23
00:01:07,852 --> 00:01:09,379
You know, it's not
that big of a hole.

24
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:11,586
We can probably
just patch it right up.

25
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:13,483
I bet she tries to patch it up,

26
00:01:13,507 --> 00:01:15,802
instead of trying to just
imagine the possibility.

27
00:01:15,826 --> 00:01:18,186
But, I mean, it is
Meredith's house.

28
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:21,846
I mean, it's my house.
And I let her live there.

29
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:24,649
I should know better.
Why don't I learn?

30
00:01:24,702 --> 00:01:27,169
I take in strays
because they're sad.

31
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:28,536
They're lonely and homeless.

32
00:01:28,622 --> 00:01:30,556
The truth is strays

33
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:34,693
are flea-ridden creatures
who pee on your stuff.

34
00:01:34,762 --> 00:01:35,860
Am I a stray?

35
00:01:35,913 --> 00:01:37,240
I mean, she acts like
I'm some kind of animal,

36
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:38,574
when who does the dishes? Me.

37
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:39,981
Yep.

38
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:41,661
Who makes sure
the piles and piles

39
00:01:41,685 --> 00:01:43,429
of dirty laundry are
fluffed and folded?

40
00:01:43,453 --> 00:01:44,531
Me.

41
00:01:44,555 --> 00:01:46,165
When she puts my clothes away,

42
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:48,957
I can't find my own
clothes in my own house.

43
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:52,694
I mean, they're probably
just in your drawers.

44
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:53,874
It's a problem.

45
00:01:53,898 --> 00:01:55,413
What's her problem?

46
00:01:55,483 --> 00:01:56,793
It's just... She's just...

47
00:01:56,817 --> 00:01:58,857
She's just impossible.
Just impossible.

48
00:02:02,839 --> 00:02:04,072
Hey, you excited?

49
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,307
About?

50
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,141
April. She's coming
in tonight, right?

51
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:09,611
Oh, um... Yeah.

52
00:02:16,253 --> 00:02:18,497
I still think you should bow
out of this anatomy class

53
00:02:18,521 --> 00:02:19,921
you signed up to teach.

54
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:23,091
I mean, pawn it off on
Grey or someone else.

55
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,804
You're not gonna have
time to teach a class

56
00:02:24,828 --> 00:02:26,762
once you've been
appointed Chief.

57
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:28,070
Haven't been appointed yet.

58
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:33,868
Um, do you know her?

59
00:02:33,937 --> 00:02:36,237
Uh, that's Dr. Tracy McConnell.

60
00:02:36,306 --> 00:02:40,542
Chief Cardio at Hopkins,
Yale Grad, Yale Meds.

61
00:02:40,611 --> 00:02:42,711
SAGES award recipient.

62
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:45,140
She's Catherine's
candidate for chief.

63
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:47,816
Dr. Webber.

64
00:02:48,652 --> 00:02:50,096
Hey. It is such an honor.

65
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,886
I have been wanting
to meet you for years.

66
00:02:51,956 --> 00:02:55,390
Your work with islet cells,
it's just absolutely inspiring.

67
00:02:56,293 --> 00:02:58,360
Well, thank you. Thank you.

68
00:03:00,297 --> 00:03:02,931
Oh, all right, I'm
sorry. This is Dr...

69
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,917
Dr... Yeah, Miranda
Bailey, of course.

70
00:03:04,969 --> 00:03:06,534
Hello. Oh.

71
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:08,347
Uh, I'm afraid you
may have gotten

72
00:03:08,371 --> 00:03:10,405
your times a little
wrong, Dr. McConnell.

73
00:03:10,473 --> 00:03:13,175
Our presentations to the board
aren't until 4:00 p.m. today.

74
00:03:13,243 --> 00:03:15,410
Actually, I asked
Dr. Webber if he wouldn't mind

75
00:03:15,478 --> 00:03:17,257
taking some time this
morning to show me around.

76
00:03:17,281 --> 00:03:19,881
You know, give me a little tour.

77
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:21,566
I wasn't invited on any tour.

78
00:03:22,219 --> 00:03:23,251
Um...

79
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,503
You know where everything is.

80
00:03:27,808 --> 00:03:30,392
Uh, don't you have
some surgeries, Doctor?

81
00:03:30,461 --> 00:03:32,561
Nothing that can't be pushed.

82
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:33,695
Great. Mmm.

83
00:03:33,764 --> 00:03:35,130
Sounds fun.

84
00:03:36,834 --> 00:03:39,150
That's one word for it.

85
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40,530
So, what time's
the thing tonight?

86
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:41,665
What thing?

87
00:03:41,689 --> 00:03:43,266
For April. She comes
back tonight, right?

88
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:44,690
Isn't... Aren't we
doing a thing?

89
00:03:44,758 --> 00:03:46,603
Big night, Avery.
When's Kepner getting in?

90
00:03:46,627 --> 00:03:47,792
No idea.

91
00:03:47,861 --> 00:03:48,905
Then what time's the thing?

92
00:03:48,929 --> 00:03:50,128
There is no thing.

93
00:03:51,131 --> 00:03:52,431
Should we clear Trauma One

94
00:03:52,499 --> 00:03:54,299
to remove the giant
bug from Avery's ass?

95
00:03:55,603 --> 00:03:57,736
Hey, I need advice.

96
00:03:57,804 --> 00:03:58,837
Okay.

97
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,483
I got tickets for
this concert thing,

98
00:04:00,507 --> 00:04:02,051
and I'm thinking
about asking Amelia,

99
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:04,053
but she and I, we don't
really go to things together.

100
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,255
Not that we couldn't,

101
00:04:05,279 --> 00:04:07,812
but should I, you
know, ask her out?

102
00:04:07,881 --> 00:04:09,214
What do you think?

103
00:04:09,283 --> 00:04:11,027
I think you're over-thinking.

104
00:04:11,051 --> 00:04:12,229
You're late.

105
00:04:12,253 --> 00:04:13,518
I know. I'm sorry.

106
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:15,820
I got stuck behind a train
that just stopped forever.

107
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:17,066
I'm sorry. You said a crash?

108
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,468
I mean, I should have
done, like, turned around

109
00:04:18,492 --> 00:04:19,391
but they shouldn't be
allowed to do that, right,

110
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:20,637
just stop on the tracks?

111
00:04:20,661 --> 00:04:22,239
I really don't care,
okay? You missed rounds.

112
00:04:22,263 --> 00:04:23,840
A pedestrian? Two pedestrians?

113
00:04:23,864 --> 00:04:25,575
It's irresponsible is
what it is, of the train.

114
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:27,360
Two pedestrians
were hit by a train?

115
00:04:27,384 --> 00:04:28,816
What?

116
00:04:28,886 --> 00:04:30,651
Oh, my God.

117
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,986
And they're alive?

118
00:04:32,055 --> 00:04:33,688
Yeah. Oh, my God.

119
00:04:33,757 --> 00:04:35,957
Two girls were hit by a
train on their way to school.

120
00:04:37,278 --> 00:04:38,477
Kids. Um...

121
00:04:40,314 --> 00:04:41,413
They're just kids.

122
00:04:45,268 --> 00:04:47,035
Jessica Tanner, 15 years old.

123
00:04:47,103 --> 00:04:49,582
Moving train swiped her, then
tossed her down the embankment.

124
00:04:49,606 --> 00:04:51,686
GCS is 15. Pressure's 100 palp.

125
00:04:51,742 --> 00:04:54,509
Right side took all the
brunt. It's one big bruise.

126
00:04:54,578 --> 00:04:56,711
There's a shortcut to school.

127
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:59,748
I take it every day
over the tracks.

128
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:01,182
She's tachy at 120.

129
00:05:01,251 --> 00:05:02,294
All right, I'm gonna
need a Doppler

130
00:05:02,318 --> 00:05:03,630
to check these
extremities for pulses.

131
00:05:03,654 --> 00:05:05,303
I tripped.

132
00:05:05,372 --> 00:05:08,239
You know, my foot, it got
stuck in between the tracks.

133
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,686
Try to stay calm, Jess.

134
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:11,190
Have you seen
the other girl? She...

135
00:05:12,278 --> 00:05:14,613
She just showed
up out of nowhere.

136
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:16,280
She tried to push
me out of the way.

137
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:18,983
Somebody? I'm not
sure what to do here!

138
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:21,836
Oh!

139
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:23,300
Help get the other
patient inside.

140
00:05:23,324 --> 00:05:24,606
Go. Torres.

141
00:05:24,674 --> 00:05:26,634
Take a look at this. Oh...

142
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:31,624
Hey, it's gonna
be all right, Jess.

143
00:05:31,648 --> 00:05:34,265
We're gonna take care
of you. Both of you. Okay?

144
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:41,672
Let's go. Go.

145
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:44,070
Hang two units of "O"
neg, check the pelvic binder,

146
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:46,194
and prep her for a
rapid-sequence intubation.

147
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:48,195
Any word on her
name? Her parents?

148
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:49,876
I don't think she had any I.D.

149
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,694
Did you look? Did
you check her bag?

150
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:52,829
Okay, where do you need me?

151
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:54,335
She needs an ex lap.

152
00:05:54,404 --> 00:05:56,115
One of her legs was ripped
completely away from the other.

153
00:05:56,139 --> 00:05:58,172
She has a wishbone injury.

154
00:05:58,241 --> 00:06:00,704
The force of the train broke her
pelvis and split her insides apart.

155
00:06:00,728 --> 00:06:02,689
I'm gonna need to stabilize
her pelvis and extremities,

156
00:06:02,713 --> 00:06:04,657
but not before you guys
address her internal injuries.

157
00:06:04,681 --> 00:06:06,297
Pupillary reflexes are sluggish.

158
00:06:06,367 --> 00:06:08,678
She's gonna need a head CT to
rule out a traumatic brain injury.

159
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:10,280
All right, you got
a name for me yet?

160
00:06:10,304 --> 00:06:12,303
No, but I found some textbooks.

161
00:06:12,373 --> 00:06:15,623
Sophomore, junior, maybe. I'm
guessing she's about 16 years old.

162
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:17,342
Okay, hang on, hang on. Quiet.

163
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:21,896
Mom.

164
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:23,597
I want my mom.

165
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:27,663
Grey, we're gonna
need to intubate. Okay.

166
00:06:27,687 --> 00:06:29,927
We don't have
much time. Go ahead.

167
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,052
Good. You're here.

168
00:06:45,121 --> 00:06:46,599
She's got multiple
complex injuries.

169
00:06:46,623 --> 00:06:48,723
She needs to go to
the OR for a washout.

170
00:06:48,792 --> 00:06:51,392
Hemothorax on her right
side that needs to be drained.

171
00:06:51,461 --> 00:06:53,060
Jess.

172
00:06:53,129 --> 00:06:55,730
Have you seen
her, the other girl?

173
00:06:55,799 --> 00:06:57,231
Is she still alive?

174
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,251
Jess, can you tell me her name?

175
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:01,853
I don't know her. So...

176
00:07:07,227 --> 00:07:09,276
You have the same
hearts drawn on your arms.

177
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,047
I think you do know each other.

178
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:18,136
Her name's Aliyah.

179
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:19,833
And you two were
out there together?

180
00:07:19,857 --> 00:07:21,089
Yes.

181
00:07:22,492 --> 00:07:25,009
Your foot didn't get
caught on the tracks, did it?

182
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:31,048
Honey, tell me what
happened out there.

183
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,069
We just wanted to be together.

184
00:07:38,826 --> 00:07:40,125
Dead or alive.

185
00:08:01,014 --> 00:08:02,981
And this is one of our

186
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:05,583
state-of-the-art
radiology suites.

187
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:07,451
We have just installed

188
00:08:07,521 --> 00:08:09,487
new data-processing systems

189
00:08:09,556 --> 00:08:10,822
with simultaneous...

190
00:08:10,891 --> 00:08:13,002
Simultaneous multi-slice
holographic imaging.

191
00:08:13,026 --> 00:08:14,309
Yeah.

192
00:08:14,378 --> 00:08:16,222
I mean, that kind of imaging's
the wave of the future.

193
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:18,529
Wave of the future. I
couldn't agree more.

194
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:25,620
Do you mind if I
take a look around?

195
00:08:25,706 --> 00:08:26,805
Be my guest.

196
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:27,972
Thank you.

197
00:08:31,795 --> 00:08:33,861
Is this the new SE-700?

198
00:08:33,931 --> 00:08:35,241
Yes, we just had it upgraded.

199
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:37,698
Admit it. You like her.

200
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:40,368
She's a solid
candidate, certainly.

201
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:41,720
But so is Bailey.

202
00:08:41,772 --> 00:08:43,082
Bailey knows you too well.

203
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:44,667
You all have been
together too long.

204
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:46,391
She doesn't push you, Richard.

205
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:47,558
Better than that.

206
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:48,838
But in a chief, you need a chief

207
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:50,461
who knows how to push back.

208
00:08:50,531 --> 00:08:51,708
Are you implying she's soft?

209
00:08:51,732 --> 00:08:53,442
Because Miranda
Bailey is anything but soft.

210
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:55,283
I'm saying that she's
too comfortable here.

211
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:57,969
We need someone who
will make us uncomfortable,

212
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:01,122
someone that'll walk in here
and push us to be the best.

213
00:09:01,191 --> 00:09:04,575
We need someone
who will surprise us.

214
00:09:05,746 --> 00:09:07,028
And you know it.

215
00:09:07,097 --> 00:09:08,774
Instant access to case imaging

216
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:10,443
would really assist
with patient care.

217
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:15,070
You're only 15. You want to die?

218
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:17,071
It's more complicated than that.

219
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,906
You were standing
in front of a train.

220
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:21,876
We weren't suicidal. We just...

221
00:09:21,945 --> 00:09:23,962
Okay, Jess, I'm gonna
tell you something personal

222
00:09:24,031 --> 00:09:25,213
about myself, okay?

223
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:27,198
Okay.

224
00:09:27,267 --> 00:09:30,502
I like men...
Romantically, sometimes.

225
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,837
And I like women, too.

226
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:35,656
It's a big, big part of my life.

227
00:09:37,377 --> 00:09:39,817
Can I ask you something
personal about yourself?

228
00:09:42,132 --> 00:09:44,265
Do you like girls?

229
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:46,100
Do you...

230
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:47,619
Do you like Aliyah?

231
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:53,474
I love her.

232
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,760
What were you
two doing out there?

233
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,654
It's not that we wanted to die.

234
00:10:07,491 --> 00:10:09,491
This was just...

235
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:11,893
The only way that
we could stay together,

236
00:10:11,979 --> 00:10:13,244
you know, forever.

237
00:10:13,313 --> 00:10:17,048
No. No, Jess. There
are so many other ways.

238
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:19,851
I... Killing yourself
solves nothing.

239
00:10:19,903 --> 00:10:22,404
My parents...

240
00:10:22,472 --> 00:10:23,971
They're sending me away...

241
00:10:24,574 --> 00:10:26,373
To a camp.

242
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,560
They come and get you
in the middle of the night,

243
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:31,228
and they take you to this place.

244
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:34,315
They change you.

245
00:10:35,751 --> 00:10:38,552
They're gonna make me
change my mind about Aliyah.

246
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:40,182
No, they won't. There's no way.

247
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:42,118
Those places don't
work. They never work.

248
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:43,742
Your parents are doing this?

249
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:47,078
Please. Please,
you can't call them.

250
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:49,930
Please don't tell them that I...

251
00:10:49,999 --> 00:10:52,233
They're the whole
reason why I'm even here.

252
00:10:52,302 --> 00:10:54,886
Please. You can't call them.

253
00:10:54,938 --> 00:10:57,421
<i>Aliyah's a good girl.
She wouldn't miss school.</i>

254
00:10:57,491 --> 00:10:58,968
Why would she be
out on the train tracks?

255
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:00,592
This doesn't make sense.

256
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,638
She suffered extensive injuries.

257
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,262
She needs surgery. I
just need your consent.

258
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,915
She's... She's okay?
She's awake? She can talk?

259
00:11:07,984 --> 00:11:09,429
No, she's unconscious.

260
00:11:09,453 --> 00:11:10,885
She did ask for her mother.

261
00:11:11,621 --> 00:11:12,954
Her mother's dead.

262
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:17,292
If I could just have your
consent for the surgery...

263
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,627
Yes.

264
00:11:19,695 --> 00:11:22,630
Excuse me. Excuse me.
We're looking for our daughter.

265
00:11:22,698 --> 00:11:25,300
Jessica Tanner. Can
you find us a doctor?

266
00:11:25,368 --> 00:11:26,545
I'm a doctor.

267
00:11:26,569 --> 00:11:28,214
I'm one of your
daughter's doctors, actually.

268
00:11:28,238 --> 00:11:29,286
Well, where is she?

269
00:11:29,339 --> 00:11:30,917
We want to see her
immediately, please.

270
00:11:30,941 --> 00:11:33,574
They said she
was hit by a train?

271
00:11:33,643 --> 00:11:34,763
Yes.

272
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:35,827
A train?

273
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,307
I think our daughters might have

274
00:11:38,331 --> 00:11:39,651
been out on the tracks together.

275
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:43,467
Jess was with your daughter?

276
00:11:43,537 --> 00:11:44,614
What's her name?

277
00:11:44,638 --> 00:11:45,638
Aliyah.

278
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:47,705
I'm Dakhir Hamed.

279
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:53,044
You keep your damn
daughter away from our little girl.

280
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:06,824
No one's taken a tab.

281
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:08,537
Why hasn't anyone taken a tab?

282
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,327
I don't know.

283
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:11,929
Uh... What I do know is the labs

284
00:12:11,998 --> 00:12:13,498
came back on the Wilbanks baby.

285
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:14,832
Everything looks good there.

286
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:17,167
My flier's perfectly placed.

287
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:18,514
It's clear,
aesthetically pleasing.

288
00:12:18,538 --> 00:12:20,183
I mean, people have
taken tabs from other fliers.

289
00:12:20,207 --> 00:12:21,884
I'm sorry. Why do you need a
roommate? You have a house.

290
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:24,341
Had a house.
Callie and I sold it.

291
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:26,722
Now it turns out I need a little
help in the rent department.

292
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,891
You'd be surprised how many
patients can't afford my fees.

293
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:30,681
I mean, what am I gonna do?

294
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,428
Gonna look parents
in the eye and tell them

295
00:12:32,452 --> 00:12:35,063
I can't treat their teeny,
tiny, little sickly babies?

296
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:36,487
Hey.

297
00:12:36,556 --> 00:12:38,155
Do you need a place to live?

298
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:40,991
Me live with you? God, no.

299
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:44,062
I just... Uh, I
already have a place.

300
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:48,833
Take a tab anyway.

301
00:12:48,902 --> 00:12:50,212
I mean, someone
has to take a tab.

302
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:51,713
It'll make other
people take tabs.

303
00:12:51,737 --> 00:12:53,048
It's like putting
money in your tip jar.

304
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:54,216
It just encourages tipping.

305
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,240
I just... I'm gonna go...

306
00:12:56,309 --> 00:12:57,408
Check on things...

307
00:12:57,944 --> 00:12:59,310
Away from here.

308
00:13:07,904 --> 00:13:09,036
Clamp.

309
00:13:10,907 --> 00:13:12,339
3-0 Prolene.

310
00:13:12,409 --> 00:13:14,708
I could use a little
breathing room here.

311
00:13:19,599 --> 00:13:20,765
A little more.

312
00:13:22,602 --> 00:13:24,035
I can't move anymore,

313
00:13:24,103 --> 00:13:26,521
or I won't be able to
zero the neuro monitor.

314
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:27,755
Everything okay?

315
00:13:27,824 --> 00:13:29,318
She's just mad about the wall.

316
00:13:29,342 --> 00:13:30,441
What wall?

317
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:31,537
Just stand and suction.

318
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:32,622
Not talking to you.

319
00:13:32,646 --> 00:13:34,411
We did talk about
taking it down.

320
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,275
You talked about it. I
was drinking tequila.

321
00:13:36,299 --> 00:13:38,733
Okay, you said it
was a good idea.

322
00:13:38,801 --> 00:13:40,463
I should remember.
I was the sober one.

323
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:42,632
I said I would think about it.

324
00:13:42,656 --> 00:13:43,966
But the words
that you said were,

325
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,623
"Let's take the bitch down."

326
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,259
That was the tequila talking.

327
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:49,471
So, when you said
this was my home, too,

328
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:50,640
that I should
think of it that way,

329
00:13:50,664 --> 00:13:51,941
that was the
tequila talking, too?

330
00:13:51,965 --> 00:13:53,475
Yeah, that sounds like
something tequila would say.

331
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,177
Can you suction over here, please?
- Mmm-hmm.

332
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:57,134
Hey, is it a load-bearing wall?

333
00:13:57,203 --> 00:13:59,563
'Cause if it is, it can actually
bring the whole house down.

334
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:08,195
Yeah, Aliyah and I, we
like to pass notes at school.

335
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:10,697
The kind that you fold
a million different ways.

336
00:14:12,501 --> 00:14:16,237
And I kept them, every single
one in a box under my bed,

337
00:14:16,306 --> 00:14:19,040
you know, so I could re-read
them when I had bad days.

338
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:21,976
Bad days?

339
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:25,930
Sometimes kids at school...

340
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:29,467
People suck, you know,

341
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:32,252
like to tease us, throw things.

342
00:14:35,091 --> 00:14:38,959
And the other day, I came home,
and my mom was in my room.

343
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,563
She had found my box of notes.

344
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:46,117
And she burned
them in the fireplace.

345
00:14:53,843 --> 00:14:56,494
Uh, Jess' parents
want to see her

346
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,341
and speak to her surgical team.

347
00:14:58,365 --> 00:14:59,681
They're here?

348
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:06,487
Tell them she's in pre-op.

349
00:15:06,555 --> 00:15:09,995
They will have to wait to
see Jess until after surgery.

350
00:15:13,947 --> 00:15:16,258
You're making Aliyah out to be
some kind of terrible influence.

351
00:15:16,282 --> 00:15:18,549
Because she is. She took
advantage of our daughter.

352
00:15:18,617 --> 00:15:19,761
Jess didn't know any better.

353
00:15:19,785 --> 00:15:21,552
What are you talking about?

354
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,220
You don't know?

355
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:25,089
They think they're in love...

356
00:15:25,158 --> 00:15:26,557
With each other.

357
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:28,603
They want to grow
up and get married.

358
00:15:28,627 --> 00:15:29,771
What?

359
00:15:29,795 --> 00:15:31,329
Honey, the doctors.

360
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:36,267
Uh, Jess has sustained multiple

361
00:15:36,336 --> 00:15:38,569
fractures, including
two in her left leg

362
00:15:38,638 --> 00:15:40,705
that need surgical
intervention immediately

363
00:15:40,774 --> 00:15:42,285
or she could lose
use of her leg.

364
00:15:42,309 --> 00:15:44,842
Unfortunately, she also
needs her belly explored

365
00:15:44,911 --> 00:15:47,156
to evaluate the source
of her internal bleeding.

366
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:50,114
There's also blood in her lungs,
which required a chest tube.

367
00:15:50,183 --> 00:15:52,328
Luckily, it seems to be
stable at the moment.

368
00:15:52,352 --> 00:15:53,951
We're taking her up now.

369
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:56,420
We'll update you
after the surgery.

370
00:15:57,691 --> 00:15:58,956
Bethany. Please, let him...

371
00:15:59,025 --> 00:16:01,191
Shut up, Steven!
Shut your stupid mouth!

372
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,571
If you had kept your mouth shut,

373
00:16:02,595 --> 00:16:04,573
Jess would be safe
at camp right now.

374
00:16:04,597 --> 00:16:06,174
But you had to give her
the heads-up, didn't you?

375
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:07,242
It's okay. You had
to tell her all about it.

376
00:16:07,266 --> 00:16:08,298
Torres, don't.

377
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:09,607
What are you doing, Torres?

378
00:16:11,087 --> 00:16:12,698
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure you

379
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:14,266
understand what
those places are like.

380
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:15,768
I know that you're trying
to help your daughter,

381
00:16:15,792 --> 00:16:17,770
but that kind of
camp is horrible.

382
00:16:17,794 --> 00:16:20,105
It will not give her the kind
of support that she needs.

383
00:16:20,129 --> 00:16:22,290
I realize that you
care about Jess, but...

384
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:25,049
Care about her? We love her.

385
00:16:25,101 --> 00:16:28,202
She's our child. Our child.

386
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:29,882
Please, this
doesn't concern you.

387
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:31,706
Jess' fear of that place

388
00:16:31,775 --> 00:16:33,085
is why she stepped in
front of a train to begin with.

389
00:16:33,109 --> 00:16:33,908
No, we are not doing
this. She doesn't feel safe.

390
00:16:33,976 --> 00:16:35,037
We are not doing this now!

391
00:16:35,061 --> 00:16:36,205
You want to give
parenting advice?

392
00:16:36,229 --> 00:16:38,662
Talk to Clueless over there.

393
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:40,164
You have no right to talk to me

394
00:16:40,233 --> 00:16:42,666
about anything other than
my child's medical care.

395
00:16:42,735 --> 00:16:45,569
She's right to feel afraid.
Those places are harmful.

396
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:49,890
They will damage her
mentally, emotionally.

397
00:16:49,959 --> 00:16:52,259
They are tantamount
to child abuse.

398
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:54,111
Torres. You are out of line.

399
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:56,680
You are here for one
thing and one thing only,

400
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:59,217
and that is to attend
to my child's injuries,

401
00:16:59,285 --> 00:17:00,551
to help my daughter.

402
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:01,652
That's it.

403
00:17:01,721 --> 00:17:03,354
So you can either shut up

404
00:17:03,423 --> 00:17:06,874
and do the job that you are
here to do, or I will get rid of you.

405
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:08,342
Sweetie, please.

406
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,752
Where do you think you're going?

407
00:17:18,822 --> 00:17:21,522
Like you said, to
help your daughter.

408
00:17:30,533 --> 00:17:32,750
That woman was
bullying her own child.

409
00:17:32,802 --> 00:17:35,113
And, you know, don't even
get me started on the husband.

410
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:36,570
He is useless. Useless.

411
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:38,317
Poor kid's got no
one in her corner.

412
00:17:38,341 --> 00:17:39,451
Mmm-mmm.

413
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:40,786
What would make someone do that?

414
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:43,377
I mean, why do
people act like that?

415
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:47,648
Karev?

416
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:50,968
Why are you asking me?

417
00:17:51,037 --> 00:17:52,336
'Cause you're a bully.

418
00:17:54,107 --> 00:17:55,506
His scar looks pretty nice.

419
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:57,753
I'm just gonna apply a little
more collagenase lotion here.

420
00:17:57,777 --> 00:18:00,677
So, um, what is your
plan with April tonight?

421
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:04,849
So, she's gonna come
home from across the world

422
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,183
to what, a locked house?

423
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:07,696
Why do you think it is
that everybody thinks

424
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,920
they have a right to a
front-row seat to my marriage?

425
00:18:09,989 --> 00:18:12,189
The show's closed.
I'm not selling tickets.

426
00:18:13,343 --> 00:18:14,442
Dr. Avery?

427
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:15,676
What?

428
00:18:15,745 --> 00:18:18,713
Your gastro flap harvest
is ready when you are.

429
00:18:18,781 --> 00:18:20,113
That's great!

430
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:28,039
Um, can you come dress this?

431
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,189
Yeah.

432
00:18:32,711 --> 00:18:35,151
You know if Kepner
wants a roommate?

433
00:18:35,882 --> 00:18:37,447
Not if it's you.

434
00:18:37,516 --> 00:18:40,996
Okay, what aren't you telling
me? You know something.

435
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:42,297
Why don't people
want to live with me?

436
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:44,188
I'm being paged.

437
00:18:44,257 --> 00:18:46,538
No, you're not.
Nobody's paging you.

438
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:49,604
What, are you
telling me I'm wrong?

439
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:51,561
I watched you push
people around for years.

440
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,898
You bullied interns.
You bullied nurses.

441
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,616
Hell, you bullied George.

442
00:18:55,685 --> 00:18:56,728
Don't go projecting
all your stuff on me

443
00:18:56,752 --> 00:18:58,147
just 'cause you got
picked on as a kid.

444
00:18:58,171 --> 00:19:00,588
Oh, no. Nobody
picked on Callie Torres.

445
00:19:00,656 --> 00:19:01,816
Really?

446
00:19:01,857 --> 00:19:03,190
Yeah, I was an easy target.

447
00:19:03,258 --> 00:19:05,136
I didn't look like the other
girls. I didn't act like them.

448
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,138
I had to learn how to stand
up to people like Karev.

449
00:19:07,162 --> 00:19:09,763
So I learned to fight.
Titanium screw, please?

450
00:19:09,832 --> 00:19:12,494
Tell you what, though, once
you punch your first bully,

451
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:14,163
the rest start to fall
in line pretty quickly.

452
00:19:14,187 --> 00:19:15,247
So you were both bullies?

453
00:19:15,271 --> 00:19:17,371
What? No. Mine was self-defense.

454
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,540
People you two used
to call me "Li'l Maggot."

455
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:24,211
'Cause I was always
younger than you and smaller...

456
00:19:24,279 --> 00:19:25,396
And smarter.

457
00:19:25,448 --> 00:19:27,881
And my lisp...

458
00:19:27,951 --> 00:19:30,551
You guys had a
field day with my lisp.

459
00:19:30,619 --> 00:19:32,352
So I was "Li'l Maggot Pierth."

460
00:19:34,174 --> 00:19:35,273
That's kind of cute.

461
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:36,940
No, it wasn't cute.

462
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,408
Not when I was begging

463
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:40,610
not to be pantsed in
the middle of the quad.

464
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,713
I mean, really think about that.

465
00:19:42,781 --> 00:19:46,016
My pants were literally pulled
off of me in front of other people.

466
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:49,654
Or when I was screaming for help

467
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:51,666
after being locked
in the janitor's closet

468
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:55,108
and left there until the cops
found me the next morning.

469
00:19:56,563 --> 00:19:57,873
You want to know
why bullies bully?

470
00:19:57,897 --> 00:19:59,480
It's 'cause they can.

471
00:19:59,549 --> 00:20:01,309
Maybe you got it worse at home,

472
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:03,762
or maybe you're just bullying to
keep from getting bullied, but really,

473
00:20:03,786 --> 00:20:05,051
it's because people like me,

474
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,522
like this girl on our
table, are alone.

475
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:13,226
And small and vulnerable.

476
00:20:13,296 --> 00:20:15,896
And pushing us around

477
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:19,800
makes you feel better about
your sad, pathetic, little lives.

478
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:26,907
But not you guys, though.

479
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:28,975
You're cool... Now.

480
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:35,766
So, after we helped
rebuild the hospital in Haiti,

481
00:20:35,834 --> 00:20:37,601
I took a team down to Houston

482
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:40,071
to help the relief
shelters after the flooding.

483
00:20:40,139 --> 00:20:41,972
Outstanding.

484
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:46,009
Um... So, why are you
interested in moving to Seattle?

485
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:49,180
I mean, it sounds like your
hospital's doing great work.

486
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,014
Oh, that wasn't
through the hospital.

487
00:20:51,084 --> 00:20:53,350
I fund most of those
trips through my nonprofit.

488
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:56,620
It's a bit of a passion
project of mine.

489
00:20:56,689 --> 00:21:00,357
Your nonprofit. Well, now.

490
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:02,693
Um, I started the
hospital's free clinic.

491
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:04,081
We're open
Wednesdays and Fridays.

492
00:21:05,731 --> 00:21:07,142
<i>She won't stop
bleeding. Damn it!</i>

493
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:08,444
<i>She's maxed out on pressors.</i>

494
00:21:08,468 --> 00:21:09,662
<i>She can't tolerate
this low a MAP.</i>

495
00:21:09,686 --> 00:21:11,030
I'm clamping the hilum.

496
00:21:11,054 --> 00:21:14,188
It's not working. Debakey.

497
00:21:14,257 --> 00:21:15,539
Sorry, do you mind if I...

498
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:17,324
Come on, guys, she's crashing.

499
00:21:17,393 --> 00:21:19,588
You don't think I know
that? Somebody page cardio.

500
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:22,412
<i>You're gonna want to open
her up with a sternotomy.</i>

501
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:24,126
<i>I'm sorry. Who
in the hell's that?</i>

502
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:27,417
Right, sorry. Hi. Dr. Tracy
McConnell, Chief of Cardio at Hopkins.

503
00:21:27,487 --> 00:21:30,337
I'm on a tour. Now,
about that sternotomy.

504
00:21:30,406 --> 00:21:31,549
Patient's chest is already open.

505
00:21:31,573 --> 00:21:33,218
I don't want to make
another major incision

506
00:21:33,242 --> 00:21:35,175
just a few inches
away. Where is cardio?

507
00:21:35,244 --> 00:21:37,106
They're saying
Wexler and Hall are out.

508
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:38,641
- Pierce is in surgery.
- Find out how long.

509
00:21:38,665 --> 00:21:40,642
<i>Okay, I want to try
twisting the hilum. Towels.</i>

510
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:42,917
You need to get control
from a higher angle.

511
00:21:42,985 --> 00:21:44,385
Her pulmonary
artery is lacerated,

512
00:21:44,437 --> 00:21:46,236
<i>which means you
have about 90 seconds</i>

513
00:21:46,306 --> 00:21:48,389
before she bleeds
to death on that table.

514
00:21:48,457 --> 00:21:51,709
I know that it seems redundant
to make another large incision

515
00:21:51,761 --> 00:21:55,028
<i>in an already-open chest,
but if you do, in under a minute,</i>

516
00:21:55,097 --> 00:21:56,329
you can have her sternum open

517
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:57,998
and get a clear
view of the field

518
00:21:58,067 --> 00:21:59,600
from an entirely
different angle.

519
00:21:59,686 --> 00:22:01,830
<i>If the choice is between
giving her two chest scars</i>

520
00:22:01,854 --> 00:22:03,094
<i>or letting her bleed to death,</i>

521
00:22:03,156 --> 00:22:05,288
I bet she would
choose the two scars.

522
00:22:09,529 --> 00:22:11,094
Grey?

523
00:22:11,164 --> 00:22:12,329
You're down to 60 seconds.

524
00:22:14,283 --> 00:22:16,583
Okay, I need a saw
and a sternal retractor.

525
00:22:16,652 --> 00:22:17,980
On it. OWEN: Prep
her for a sternotomy.

526
00:22:18,004 --> 00:22:19,119
Right away.

527
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:29,530
Got it. Here's the bleeder.

528
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:33,333
Okay, I'll need 4-0 Prolene
and a pericardial patch, please.

529
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:42,826
Got it.

530
00:22:45,314 --> 00:22:48,331
That was a hell of
a save, McConnell.

531
00:22:48,401 --> 00:22:51,334
It's not my save, sir.
They did the hard work.

532
00:22:51,404 --> 00:22:53,670
I just helped change
their perspective a little.

533
00:22:53,739 --> 00:22:55,840
Well, I should probably go...

534
00:23:18,247 --> 00:23:20,848
Hey. Why don't people
want to live with me?

535
00:23:20,916 --> 00:23:22,393
Is it 'cause I have a kid
or is it 'cause I'm a boss?

536
00:23:22,417 --> 00:23:23,695
Like people don't want
to live with their boss?

537
00:23:23,719 --> 00:23:25,563
Hey, did you hear,
Dr. Torres stabbed

538
00:23:25,587 --> 00:23:27,365
a white supremacist in the face?

539
00:23:27,389 --> 00:23:30,201
Or a patient bit Karev and lost
his finger or his eye or some...

540
00:23:30,225 --> 00:23:32,159
Shut up and speak!
What aren't you telling me?

541
00:23:34,229 --> 00:23:35,829
Okay, have you
ever been assigned

542
00:23:35,898 --> 00:23:37,831
back-to-back overnight
NICU shifts, Edwards?

543
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,850
And I'm not talking
for, like, a weekend.

544
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:43,520
I'm talking for months of
long, terrible, quiet nights

545
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:46,356
all alone in the NICU
watching over 27 incubators

546
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:48,025
full of fragile,
dying, little lives.

547
00:23:48,094 --> 00:23:50,494
You know how hard that
is? Do you have any idea?

548
00:23:55,718 --> 00:24:00,320
You are kind of a legend
with the interns and residents.

549
00:24:03,458 --> 00:24:04,958
Go on.

550
00:24:05,027 --> 00:24:06,894
You're one of the
Seattle Grace Five.

551
00:24:06,962 --> 00:24:08,896
I survived a plane
crash. Big deal.

552
00:24:08,981 --> 00:24:11,047
And a car crash. And a shooting.

553
00:24:11,117 --> 00:24:12,483
You might be immortal.

554
00:24:12,551 --> 00:24:14,496
You mastered one of the
most exclusive specialties

555
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,620
basically overnight, and
then you took Herman's job

556
00:24:16,689 --> 00:24:17,888
and her eyesight.

557
00:24:17,957 --> 00:24:19,551
Okay, that's... That's just...

558
00:24:19,575 --> 00:24:22,142
You have screwed dozens of
interns, and you got them all fired.

559
00:24:22,211 --> 00:24:25,162
You speak really fast,
like superhuman fast.

560
00:24:25,214 --> 00:24:26,379
You have a weird name.

561
00:24:26,466 --> 00:24:28,009
You know, that's not
true. That's not true.

562
00:24:28,033 --> 00:24:30,501
I only slept with one intern,
and I have an awesome name.

563
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:33,170
I mean, what, man?

564
00:24:33,238 --> 00:24:34,478
Like, what? What else?

565
00:24:34,507 --> 00:24:36,406
I mean, what...

566
00:24:36,476 --> 00:24:37,407
Do people have a problem
with the fact that I have one leg?

567
00:24:37,477 --> 00:24:38,887
I mean, do people
actually go there

568
00:24:38,911 --> 00:24:40,722
and talk crap about
a one-legged person?

569
00:24:40,746 --> 00:24:43,125
Because that's just
discrimination against amputees.

570
00:24:43,149 --> 00:24:44,414
They say you have two legs,

571
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:47,100
and you are only pretending
that one is amputated.

572
00:24:48,521 --> 00:24:50,361
For the parking space. I...

573
00:24:52,892 --> 00:24:54,024
We good?

574
00:24:56,612 --> 00:24:58,756
Hey. Tell us something good.

575
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:00,425
Mer says Aliyah's
hanging in there.

576
00:25:00,449 --> 00:25:02,216
Well, that's something.

577
00:25:02,284 --> 00:25:05,219
Also, Jess might not
be going to that camp.

578
00:25:05,287 --> 00:25:08,888
I may have made some calls.

579
00:25:08,957 --> 00:25:10,523
Which one of you did it?

580
00:25:10,593 --> 00:25:12,070
You called child
protective services on me?

581
00:25:12,094 --> 00:25:15,379
Is this a joke? Is this
some game to you people?

582
00:25:15,431 --> 00:25:18,031
If I want to send my
child to a beautiful camp

583
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:20,033
run by a lovely pastor

584
00:25:20,102 --> 00:25:22,246
then I have every
legal right to do so,

585
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,916
and it is none of your business.

586
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:26,290
Do you understand? Stay
away from my little girl.

587
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:27,599
And stop filling her head

588
00:25:27,643 --> 00:25:30,043
with your faithless,
inappropriate nonsense.

589
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:32,472
You repulse me.
You're disgusting!

590
00:25:34,617 --> 00:25:36,066
Oh, crap.

591
00:25:36,135 --> 00:25:38,312
My heart was pounding, and
there was a noise in my head

592
00:25:38,336 --> 00:25:40,270
and then her face
was just coming at me

593
00:25:40,338 --> 00:25:41,605
and I was like, "Ah!"

594
00:25:41,674 --> 00:25:42,939
And then... Ow, ow!

595
00:25:43,008 --> 00:25:44,324
My fist had a mind of its own.

596
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:45,888
'Cause I didn't even know
I was gonna punch her

597
00:25:45,912 --> 00:25:47,344
until she was punched.

598
00:25:47,413 --> 00:25:50,331
Oh, my God! I lost
control. I am a monster.

599
00:25:50,399 --> 00:25:52,833
I would have paid money.
Cash money. Like 1,000 bucks.

600
00:25:52,901 --> 00:25:55,101
Worth every penny.
It was beautiful.

601
00:25:55,171 --> 00:25:56,615
Okay, what happened?
Yeah, we want details.

602
00:25:56,639 --> 00:25:57,782
And would someone
page me, please,

603
00:25:57,806 --> 00:25:59,206
next time Pierce hulks out?

604
00:25:59,275 --> 00:26:01,419
Think it's funny? It won't
be when she loses her job.

605
00:26:01,443 --> 00:26:03,193
I'm gonna lose my job?

606
00:26:03,262 --> 00:26:04,740
You're not gonna lose
your job. She attacked you.

607
00:26:04,764 --> 00:26:06,196
Kind of. Right?

608
00:26:06,265 --> 00:26:08,515
Okay, you weren't
there. You don't know.

609
00:26:08,601 --> 00:26:10,244
Oh, the lady deserved
it. She got bigot-slapped.

610
00:26:10,268 --> 00:26:12,230
You know she deserved
it. It doesn't matter.

611
00:26:12,254 --> 00:26:14,532
There's a right and a wrong
way for us to conduct ourselves.

612
00:26:14,556 --> 00:26:16,490
Mmm. You know
what? Grey has a point.

613
00:26:16,558 --> 00:26:19,777
Next time, leave the thumb
outside the fist when you clench.

614
00:26:19,829 --> 00:26:21,761
That way, you avoid
bone damage. See?

615
00:26:21,831 --> 00:26:24,597
Okay, bitch lady's fine
medically, no real injury,

616
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:27,151
but she is seriously pissed
and out for your head.

617
00:26:27,203 --> 00:26:28,446
See? Oh, God.

618
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:30,150
Is it true? Callie
punched a homophobe?

619
00:26:30,188 --> 00:26:31,454
Pierce punched a homophobe.

620
00:26:31,523 --> 00:26:33,156
Ooh! Unexpected. High-five.

621
00:26:33,225 --> 00:26:34,285
No. Yes!

622
00:26:34,309 --> 00:26:35,309
Come on.

623
00:26:39,482 --> 00:26:42,015
I have to go apologize to
that horrible woman, don't I?

624
00:26:45,104 --> 00:26:46,569
What are you doing?

625
00:26:46,638 --> 00:26:48,616
Scrubbing in on an
open cholecystectomy.

626
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,408
Yes, no, I can see that,
but what are you doing?

627
00:26:51,476 --> 00:26:53,121
Why are you scrubbing in
for a three-hour procedure

628
00:26:53,145 --> 00:26:55,745
when you have a presentation
to the board in 45 minutes?

629
00:26:55,815 --> 00:26:57,625
The patient is in terrible pain.

630
00:26:57,649 --> 00:27:00,128
I have the ability
to stop that pain,

631
00:27:00,152 --> 00:27:02,853
so I'm going to do that.

632
00:27:02,922 --> 00:27:05,539
So, what, you're just gonna
not show up for the presentation?

633
00:27:05,625 --> 00:27:07,686
It doesn't matter if I do.

634
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:11,528
Look, I just spent the
day with Tracy McConnell.

635
00:27:11,597 --> 00:27:15,565
She's chirpy and blonde
with a perky, little ponytail.

636
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:17,133
And she's...

637
00:27:18,737 --> 00:27:23,523
Fantastic, smart, talented.

638
00:27:23,592 --> 00:27:28,695
I tried really hard to
hate her, but I couldn't.

639
00:27:28,763 --> 00:27:31,576
She's perfect. And
Webber's ready to marry her.

640
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,550
Hell, I might marry her, too.

641
00:27:33,619 --> 00:27:36,219
No offense. She's a catch.

642
00:27:36,288 --> 00:27:37,749
And we'd be lucky to have her.

643
00:27:37,773 --> 00:27:40,134
Hey, she may be the new Idris.

644
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:42,860
Now, it's fine.

645
00:27:42,928 --> 00:27:47,280
Okay, being Chief isn't
the only thing that I...

646
00:27:47,349 --> 00:27:50,884
I mean, I've got my son that
I hardly see as it is. And you.

647
00:27:50,952 --> 00:27:53,072
And I got this class that
I got to start teaching.

648
00:27:53,121 --> 00:27:55,422
So, you know, it doesn't matter.

649
00:27:55,508 --> 00:27:56,651
It's fine, really.

650
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:57,853
Miranda, that's... No.

651
00:27:57,877 --> 00:27:59,142
Leave it alone.

652
00:28:00,212 --> 00:28:03,013
Okay? Just... Leave it.

653
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,607
Hi.

654
00:28:19,631 --> 00:28:23,516
Oh, hey. Uh, is the
room still available?

655
00:28:23,585 --> 00:28:26,064
Did your friends put you up
to this? Did you lose a bet?

656
00:28:26,088 --> 00:28:28,555
Or do you have a
thing for feet? Or foot?

657
00:28:28,623 --> 00:28:29,689
What?

658
00:28:29,758 --> 00:28:30,824
Uh, no.

659
00:28:30,892 --> 00:28:32,132
Well, okay, hold on.

660
00:28:32,194 --> 00:28:33,338
Why would you
want to live with me

661
00:28:33,362 --> 00:28:35,842
instead of your intern buddies?

662
00:28:36,364 --> 00:28:40,050
I don't, uh, have
any intern buddies.

663
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:42,152
They think I posed as
an attending on purpose

664
00:28:42,221 --> 00:28:46,156
and they made up all this stuff
about me and it isn't even true.

665
00:28:46,225 --> 00:28:49,242
Nobody wants to talk to
me, let alone live with me.

666
00:28:51,697 --> 00:28:52,996
It's okay. Thanks.

667
00:28:55,801 --> 00:28:58,035
Um... Hold on. Just so you know,

668
00:28:58,103 --> 00:29:00,582
two months up front.
Yeah? Okay. Mmm-hmm.

669
00:29:00,606 --> 00:29:02,806
Well... Well, we can maybe...
We can make this work.

670
00:29:06,695 --> 00:29:08,462
Scrub out. I'll finish.

671
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:10,174
You can still make
your presentation.

672
00:29:10,198 --> 00:29:12,243
DeLuca, will you escort Warren
out of my surgery, please?

673
00:29:12,267 --> 00:29:13,367
But...

674
00:29:13,435 --> 00:29:14,634
Okay.

675
00:29:16,605 --> 00:29:19,439
Don't even think about
it. You do not know me.

676
00:29:21,943 --> 00:29:24,711
Miranda, you are rolling over.

677
00:29:24,779 --> 00:29:26,546
You are quitting in
the middle of the race,

678
00:29:26,615 --> 00:29:28,715
and that is not okay.

679
00:29:28,783 --> 00:29:31,651
Would you let me quit?
Would you let Tuck quit?

680
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,554
Would you?

681
00:29:33,639 --> 00:29:35,405
What did you tell Tuck

682
00:29:35,474 --> 00:29:37,074
when he wanted to
quit the French horn?

683
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:40,560
He was a terrible French
horn player, and still,

684
00:29:40,646 --> 00:29:41,646
what did you tell him?

685
00:29:41,713 --> 00:29:42,841
"You made a commitment."

686
00:29:42,865 --> 00:29:44,797
"You made a commitment!"

687
00:29:44,867 --> 00:29:47,400
And now who is first chair?

688
00:29:48,954 --> 00:29:49,994
Tuck is.

689
00:29:50,055 --> 00:29:51,387
Tuck is!

690
00:29:51,457 --> 00:29:53,222
You don't quit.
You don't roll over.

691
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:56,726
You don't let anybody
take your chair!

692
00:29:56,796 --> 00:29:59,679
Miranda Bailey,
what chair are you?

693
00:29:59,748 --> 00:30:01,176
First chair. Yeah,
I cannot hear you.

694
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,644
What chair? First
chair? First chair.

695
00:30:02,668 --> 00:30:04,400
First chair! That's right!

696
00:30:06,204 --> 00:30:07,721
Jess' injuries were extensive,

697
00:30:07,789 --> 00:30:09,489
but surgery went
better than expected.

698
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:11,157
Oh, thank God.

699
00:30:11,227 --> 00:30:13,326
Uh, Bethany wanted me to ask,

700
00:30:13,395 --> 00:30:15,828
do you know when Jess
might be discharged?

701
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:18,665
She's, I guess,
arranging for the camp

702
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:20,512
to come pick Jess
up from here, and...

703
00:30:20,536 --> 00:30:22,213
What? What are you saying?

704
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:25,072
There were complications
during the surgery,

705
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:26,589
and Aliyah lost a lot of blood,

706
00:30:26,659 --> 00:30:29,225
and her blood pressure
was very low for some time.

707
00:30:29,278 --> 00:30:30,510
And we just won't know

708
00:30:30,579 --> 00:30:32,596
if that caused damage
unless she wakes up.

709
00:30:32,665 --> 00:30:36,066
So, she might not wake up?
That's what you're saying?

710
00:30:36,118 --> 00:30:37,645
I'm sorry, is his
daughter going to die?

711
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:39,181
I can't discuss another
patient's personal information.

712
00:30:39,205 --> 00:30:40,603
I'm so sorry.

713
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:42,017
This can't be... This
shouldn't be happening.

714
00:30:42,041 --> 00:30:43,602
We wanted to give her a future.

715
00:30:43,626 --> 00:30:45,487
We came to this country
when she was eight.

716
00:30:45,511 --> 00:30:47,606
Two years later, my wife died.

717
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:49,029
My family, they said,

718
00:30:49,098 --> 00:30:51,159
"Dakhir, you have no business
raising your daughter alone."

719
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:52,749
Maybe they were right.

720
00:30:52,801 --> 00:30:54,718
What do I know
about raising a girl,

721
00:30:54,786 --> 00:30:56,946
now a teenage girl, in America?

722
00:30:58,974 --> 00:31:02,492
All I know is it's hard.

723
00:31:07,916 --> 00:31:09,832
Aliyah doesn't confide in me.

724
00:31:10,502 --> 00:31:11,935
Why would she?

725
00:31:12,004 --> 00:31:15,238
In my community, we don't
talk about things like this.

726
00:31:15,291 --> 00:31:17,658
Aliyah's mother would
have known what to say.

727
00:31:18,694 --> 00:31:20,460
She always knew.

728
00:31:22,665 --> 00:31:24,898
We came here to
give her a future.

729
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:25,966
And now...

730
00:31:29,354 --> 00:31:31,121
Do you have a picture?

731
00:31:32,841 --> 00:31:34,424
Excuse me?

732
00:31:34,476 --> 00:31:35,908
Of your daughter?

733
00:31:36,979 --> 00:31:39,045
Here's... Here's Jess.

734
00:31:39,114 --> 00:31:40,992
You can't tell now with
the tube in her mouth,

735
00:31:41,016 --> 00:31:43,116
but she has the best smile.

736
00:31:48,373 --> 00:31:50,707
This is Aliyah maybe
a year ago now.

737
00:31:50,776 --> 00:31:52,470
I took it at school
after a game.

738
00:31:52,494 --> 00:31:54,160
You know, I never realized,

739
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:56,146
but I think that's your
daughter with her.

740
00:32:00,252 --> 00:32:02,252
They look really happy.

741
00:32:04,556 --> 00:32:06,889
I don't believe we were
introduced properly before.

742
00:32:06,959 --> 00:32:08,158
I'm Steven.

743
00:32:10,696 --> 00:32:11,762
Dakhir.

744
00:32:15,701 --> 00:32:19,135
Your patient's been
out of surgery a while.

745
00:32:19,204 --> 00:32:21,237
Did you wait to
update the family

746
00:32:21,306 --> 00:32:23,272
until my patient was
out of surgery, too?

747
00:32:32,084 --> 00:32:34,784
Because this hospital
is worth more than that.

748
00:32:34,853 --> 00:32:36,452
Thank you. Thank you.

749
00:32:39,758 --> 00:32:42,158
Bailey should be here by now.

750
00:32:43,194 --> 00:32:44,560
Hi. Hello.

751
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:46,710
Sorry to interrupt, but
Dr. Bailey has a request.

752
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:54,987
I'm sure Dr. McConnell gave
you an excellent presentation.

753
00:32:55,057 --> 00:32:57,157
Scissor. Watch that tissue.

754
00:32:57,225 --> 00:32:59,992
She would be
excellent for the job.

755
00:33:00,062 --> 00:33:01,661
But that's not the point.

756
00:33:01,729 --> 00:33:05,831
The point is McConnell
and I offer different things.

757
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:09,169
She is new and shiny.

758
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:11,337
And she likes a good challenge.

759
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:13,506
I know. I spent the
whole day with her.

760
00:33:13,575 --> 00:33:16,676
She jumps into new
challenges all the time.

761
00:33:16,744 --> 00:33:20,224
And that's what this place is
to her. Her newest challenge.

762
00:33:20,748 --> 00:33:22,682
Until she finds her next one.

763
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:24,184
And her next.

764
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:25,618
But that's not me.

765
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:29,122
See, I don't care if this place

766
00:33:29,191 --> 00:33:31,023
is the shiniest or the fanciest

767
00:33:31,093 --> 00:33:33,025
or if it's a beat-up
hunk of junk.

768
00:33:33,095 --> 00:33:36,362
As far as I'm concerned,
it'll always be the ship

769
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:39,365
that made the Kessel
Run in less than 12 parsecs.

770
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:41,867
This is not a
stepping stone for me.

771
00:33:41,936 --> 00:33:45,871
I believe in this hospital
and what it can do.

772
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:48,708
And I want to push
this bucket of bolts

773
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:52,090
to do the most impossible
things you have ever seen.

774
00:33:52,114 --> 00:33:55,381
And then I'll do more
because this is my challenge.

775
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:56,760
There's a bleeder on the fossa.

776
00:33:56,784 --> 00:34:00,886
Yeah. Clamp. Use the argon beam.

777
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:02,222
Avoid CBD.

778
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:04,557
Slowly.

779
00:34:04,626 --> 00:34:05,758
Let me.

780
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:07,627
Good.

781
00:34:09,831 --> 00:34:11,598
There.

782
00:34:11,666 --> 00:34:15,435
This job was made
for me. Staples.

783
00:34:16,738 --> 00:34:19,038
This job belongs to me.

784
00:34:19,107 --> 00:34:20,173
Suction.

785
00:34:21,809 --> 00:34:24,661
I've earned first chair.

786
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:26,829
Suture.

787
00:34:26,899 --> 00:34:29,916
And every single one
of you already knows it.

788
00:34:31,019 --> 00:34:32,335
Ready to close.

789
00:34:36,508 --> 00:34:38,742
Well, damn it.

790
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:49,914
<i>Dr. Hudson to OR 3.</i>

791
00:34:49,938 --> 00:34:51,872
<i>Dr. Hudson to OR 3.</i>

792
00:34:54,042 --> 00:34:56,020
Is Jess still at her
post-op x-rays?

793
00:34:56,044 --> 00:34:57,856
Yeah, Dr. Torres
took her a bit ago.

794
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,479
Yeah.

795
00:34:59,548 --> 00:35:01,147
You have some nerve coming here.

796
00:35:01,216 --> 00:35:02,615
Bethany.

797
00:35:02,684 --> 00:35:06,136
Mrs. Tanner, I would
like to apologize.

798
00:35:06,205 --> 00:35:08,538
I was totally out
of line before.

799
00:35:09,875 --> 00:35:11,875
To think I trusted you
to treat my daughter.

800
00:35:11,944 --> 00:35:13,059
Bethany.

801
00:35:13,127 --> 00:35:14,705
I am suing you and
everyone else we have met

802
00:35:14,729 --> 00:35:15,840
in this godforsaken hospital.

803
00:35:15,864 --> 00:35:17,104
Bethany, shut up!

804
00:35:18,233 --> 00:35:21,167
No one is suing! No
one is pressing charges!

805
00:35:21,236 --> 00:35:24,354
The person who should
be apologizing is you!

806
00:35:24,423 --> 00:35:26,717
We almost lost our child today!

807
00:35:26,741 --> 00:35:28,942
She almost died!

808
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:30,972
We are not sending Jess away!

809
00:35:30,996 --> 00:35:33,975
This stops now. Do you
hear me? It stops now.

810
00:35:33,999 --> 00:35:37,400
Steven, what are you saying?
This stops, or I am gone.

811
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:39,113
I will leave, and I
will take Jess with me,

812
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:41,297
and you will never
see her again.

813
00:35:42,641 --> 00:35:47,109
I don't care if she's gay.

814
00:35:47,179 --> 00:35:50,547
I care if she's loved.
I care if she's happy.

815
00:35:50,615 --> 00:35:52,326
And that is what you
should care about!

816
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:55,117
What is wrong with
you that you don't?

817
00:36:15,923 --> 00:36:17,435
So, we were able to stop

818
00:36:17,459 --> 00:36:18,902
the bleeding, and she's stable.

819
00:36:18,926 --> 00:36:21,566
So I thought you'd like to
see her because she is awake.

820
00:36:30,755 --> 00:36:32,589
It's okay. It's okay.

821
00:36:34,259 --> 00:36:35,791
I'm here, Aliyah.

822
00:36:35,861 --> 00:36:37,327
You're okay.

823
00:36:39,147 --> 00:36:40,530
Jessica is okay, too.

824
00:36:42,233 --> 00:36:44,817
Shh. Don't try
to talk. It's okay.

825
00:36:44,903 --> 00:36:46,269
I have something for you.

826
00:36:52,411 --> 00:36:55,390
Jessica asked if I
could read this to you if...

827
00:36:55,414 --> 00:36:57,030
When you wake up.

828
00:36:57,099 --> 00:36:58,339
So...

829
00:37:04,356 --> 00:37:06,372
"Dear my beautiful Aliyah..."

830
00:37:10,278 --> 00:37:11,518
Well, I like her already.

831
00:37:31,649 --> 00:37:33,283
Oh.

832
00:37:33,351 --> 00:37:35,385
Sorry. You know, I, uh...

833
00:37:35,453 --> 00:37:36,693
I thought...

834
00:37:38,473 --> 00:37:39,650
Why aren't you at home?

835
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:41,841
Because I thought
you'd be at home.

836
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:44,010
Right, well, I just
assumed that...

837
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,679
It's fine. Just, um...

838
00:37:48,417 --> 00:37:51,251
Go and sleep there
tonight. A real bed and all.

839
00:37:52,521 --> 00:37:55,355
Right. Real bed. Yeah. Thanks.

840
00:37:55,424 --> 00:37:58,558
I've been flying all day.
I'm exhausted. Dirty.

841
00:37:59,461 --> 00:38:00,527
Okay.

842
00:38:03,815 --> 00:38:05,181
But we can talk tomorrow?

843
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:10,392
I really want us
to talk, Jackson.

844
00:38:13,258 --> 00:38:14,357
Good night.

845
00:38:41,002 --> 00:38:42,218
Behold.

846
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:47,040
Everything the light
touches is yours.

847
00:38:47,108 --> 00:38:49,188
You're stupid.

848
00:38:49,828 --> 00:38:52,028
Congratulations, Chief.

849
00:39:03,542 --> 00:39:05,308
This looks amazing.

850
00:39:05,377 --> 00:39:07,644
This is amazing.

851
00:39:07,713 --> 00:39:09,089
Now, I love that
you love feeding me,

852
00:39:09,113 --> 00:39:10,692
but I can't keep eating
like this every night.

853
00:39:10,716 --> 00:39:12,131
I'm gonna get fat.

854
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,000
What's wrong with
being fat? I used to be fat.

855
00:39:15,036 --> 00:39:16,798
That's funny. No, really.

856
00:39:16,822 --> 00:39:19,356
I mean, not just
roly-poly. I mean big.

857
00:39:20,525 --> 00:39:22,570
I mean, it didn't
matter much till what,

858
00:39:22,594 --> 00:39:24,794
I don't know, 5th
grade, maybe? 6th?

859
00:39:24,863 --> 00:39:27,446
And then suddenly,
everybody seemed to care.

860
00:39:27,515 --> 00:39:29,582
I got picked on a bunch.

861
00:39:29,651 --> 00:39:32,101
I mean, stupid stuff, you
know? Names, pranks.

862
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:35,304
They shoved me in a
locker once, and I got stuck.

863
00:39:35,374 --> 00:39:36,406
I was...

864
00:39:36,475 --> 00:39:38,157
Well, I was the fat kid in class

865
00:39:38,226 --> 00:39:39,591
and the screw-up at home.

866
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:42,162
And it sucked. I
mean, it was really hell.

867
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:44,359
So in the summer
after 8th grade,

868
00:39:44,383 --> 00:39:46,527
when I basically spent three
straight months on my bike

869
00:39:46,551 --> 00:39:49,151
riding everywhere,
all day, every day,

870
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,187
literally riding my ass off.

871
00:39:51,256 --> 00:39:53,416
School started.
Nobody recognized me.

872
00:39:54,726 --> 00:39:57,527
I toughened up. I mean,
I had to, you know?

873
00:39:58,964 --> 00:40:00,363
Want more rice?

874
00:40:06,454 --> 00:40:07,698
Who does that?

875
00:40:07,722 --> 00:40:09,700
Who carpools to work with
somebody in the morning

876
00:40:09,724 --> 00:40:11,491
and then leaves
without them that night?

877
00:40:12,627 --> 00:40:14,661
I can't believe she...
She just left me.

878
00:40:14,729 --> 00:40:17,330
I'm happy to give you a
ride. Actually, I did want to...

879
00:40:17,399 --> 00:40:20,378
I don't even want to
go in there. I may lose it.

880
00:40:20,402 --> 00:40:22,167
Not even kidding. I may...

881
00:40:31,096 --> 00:40:32,562
What's happening?

882
00:40:34,216 --> 00:40:35,414
You. Come here.

883
00:40:35,483 --> 00:40:36,649
I...

884
00:40:37,352 --> 00:40:38,451
Sorry.

885
00:40:41,523 --> 00:40:42,788
Sit. Good.

886
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:44,289
<i>I want you to stop</i>

887
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:46,103
<i>and take a closer look
at the body in front of you.</i>

888
00:40:46,127 --> 00:40:48,561
I live here, too, and
that means I get a say.

889
00:40:48,629 --> 00:40:53,316
And I say you two need
to figure your crap out.

890
00:40:53,385 --> 00:40:55,012
<i>There's nothing
special about it.</i>

891
00:40:55,036 --> 00:40:56,653
<i>It's just a body.</i>

892
00:40:56,721 --> 00:40:59,856
<i>So, why are you here?
What's so different?</i>

893
00:40:59,925 --> 00:41:00,990
<i>What's changed?</i>

894
00:41:01,059 --> 00:41:02,492
Sorry about the wall.

895
00:41:02,561 --> 00:41:03,693
I...

896
00:41:05,263 --> 00:41:06,663
Jumped the gun.

897
00:41:06,731 --> 00:41:08,192
I'm sorry I said you had fleas.

898
00:41:08,216 --> 00:41:10,316
Meredith! What?

899
00:41:10,385 --> 00:41:12,485
I don't...

900
00:41:12,554 --> 00:41:17,723
I don't know how to talk to
you. You are a lot sometimes.

901
00:41:18,677 --> 00:41:21,060
I don't totally like you.

902
00:41:21,129 --> 00:41:22,995
Wow. Okay.

903
00:41:23,064 --> 00:41:24,842
But I don't have to,
because you're family.

904
00:41:24,866 --> 00:41:26,065
I love you.

905
00:41:46,071 --> 00:41:47,219
<i>My answer is...</i>

906
00:41:47,288 --> 00:41:49,121
<i>You.</i>

907
00:41:49,207 --> 00:41:51,140
<i>The thing that has
changed is you.</i>

908
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:56,278
<i>I want you to throw
everything you think you know</i>

909
00:41:56,348 --> 00:41:58,448
<i>about anatomy out the window...</i>

910
00:42:00,785 --> 00:42:02,251
<i>And look at this cadaver</i>

911
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:04,480
<i>like you've never seen
a human body before.</i>

912
00:42:08,143 --> 00:42:10,126
<i>Now pick up your scalpels.</i>

913
00:42:10,195 --> 00:42:11,761
Place them below
the xiphoid process.

914
00:42:13,514 --> 00:42:14,713
Press firmly.

915
00:42:17,135 --> 00:42:18,184
No regrets.

916
00:42:19,387 --> 00:42:20,387
<i>And let's begin.</i>
