1
00:00:02,736 --> 00:00:03,780
<i>I am fine.</i>

2
00:00:03,804 --> 00:00:05,670
<i>I am happy to be here.</i>

3
00:00:05,739 --> 00:00:08,474
Truly, I have
been through a lot,

4
00:00:08,542 --> 00:00:12,777
and I'm lucky to be alive, and
I'm lucky to be okay, and I get that.

5
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:16,448
So, yes, I'm just
happy to be here.

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,266
Great.

7
00:00:18,335 --> 00:00:21,002
You know, Doctor,
most surgeons, uh,

8
00:00:21,071 --> 00:00:24,473
get kind of rankled at
hospital-mandated therapy.

9
00:00:24,541 --> 00:00:26,052
Bailey's just
looking out for me.

10
00:00:26,076 --> 00:00:27,509
I know the drill.

11
00:00:27,578 --> 00:00:29,344
So, this should be quick.

12
00:00:29,412 --> 00:00:31,480
You know, you
chose the short straw,

13
00:00:31,548 --> 00:00:33,582
or the... Is it the long straw?

14
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:34,730
Whatever the good straw is.

15
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:41,030
Lay off the damn horn, will ya?

16
00:00:42,225 --> 00:00:43,425
God, carpool sucks. Hang on.

17
00:00:43,494 --> 00:00:44,676
Is Wilson coming?

18
00:00:44,745 --> 00:00:46,523
I think so. What do
you mean you think so?

19
00:00:46,547 --> 00:00:48,947
I can't... She's
all over the place.

20
00:00:49,016 --> 00:00:50,593
I don't even know why she
let me back in the house.

21
00:00:50,617 --> 00:00:52,278
I mean, we barely talk,
which is probably good

22
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:54,080
because it's fewer chances
I'll piss her off again.

23
00:00:54,104 --> 00:00:55,148
That's pathetic.

24
00:00:55,172 --> 00:00:56,232
What's her problem?

25
00:00:56,256 --> 00:00:57,288
She's in a mood.

26
00:00:57,357 --> 00:00:58,402
Still?

27
00:00:59,593 --> 00:01:00,903
I said to tell her that
I needed a minute.

28
00:01:00,927 --> 00:01:02,555
You didn't tell me that.
- Yes, I did.

29
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:03,712
You didn't listen.

30
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:06,414
So done with carpool.

31
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:14,790
Incoming.

32
00:01:14,859 --> 00:01:16,002
Twenty minutes, chest pains.

33
00:01:16,026 --> 00:01:17,137
I'll take it. Page cardio.

34
00:01:17,161 --> 00:01:18,526
Anyone but Riggs.

35
00:01:18,595 --> 00:01:19,761
Page Riggs.

36
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:20,907
He just said...

37
00:01:20,931 --> 00:01:22,530
I can hear.

38
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:24,811
You know that Dr. Hunt
punched Dr. Riggs.

39
00:01:24,835 --> 00:01:26,312
The only way they're
gonna learn to work together

40
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:27,970
is if they work together,

41
00:01:28,038 --> 00:01:32,107
so any cardio consults that get
paged to the pit, you page Riggs.

42
00:01:32,176 --> 00:01:35,010
You know, this is my one
happy place right now?

43
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:36,756
Please don't make
it a crappy place.

44
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,480
Oh, Kepner, I feel you. I do.

45
00:01:38,548 --> 00:01:39,564
Page Riggs.

46
00:01:44,738 --> 00:01:45,854
Hi. Maya Roberts.

47
00:01:45,923 --> 00:01:46,988
Dr. Karev. I know.

48
00:01:47,057 --> 00:01:48,623
Uh, this is my mom, Judi.

49
00:01:48,692 --> 00:01:50,858
Thank you for making the
time to see my daughter.

50
00:01:50,927 --> 00:01:52,756
Have we met before?
I looked you up.

51
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,291
And you are? Uh...

52
00:01:54,315 --> 00:01:56,447
Cross. Dr. Cross. Go.

53
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:57,516
Right.

54
00:01:57,584 --> 00:01:59,184
"Maya Roberts, 15.

55
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:02,187
"Status, post below-knee amputation
of the right leg two years ago

56
00:02:02,256 --> 00:02:03,722
"after diagnosis of bone cancer,

57
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:05,234
"now recurring in
the ribs and sternum."

58
00:02:05,258 --> 00:02:06,925
I know why I'm here.

59
00:02:06,994 --> 00:02:09,172
I just wanted to talk about you.

60
00:02:09,196 --> 00:02:10,445
It says here in your CV

61
00:02:10,514 --> 00:02:13,231
you made buttholes for
babies who didn't have them.

62
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,899
Hang on. That's...

63
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,902
Listen, I'm 15 with
a chest full of cancer.

64
00:02:16,971 --> 00:02:19,282
This hospital is known for
making miracles happen,

65
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:22,891
and I'm looking for
an epic-size miracle.

66
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,437
According to my
research, it looks like

67
00:02:24,461 --> 00:02:26,661
you're the guy who
can make it happen.

68
00:02:27,214 --> 00:02:28,625
I am confused
about the buttholes.

69
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:30,282
Strange detour. So, discuss.

70
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:31,978
Or how about you
humor me and let me

71
00:02:32,002 --> 00:02:33,918
pretend like I'm in
charge for a sec?

72
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:35,253
Now, uh, Ms. Roberts...

73
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:36,621
What do you want to know?

74
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:39,124
Two years ago, I felt
a pain in my right tibia.

75
00:02:39,192 --> 00:02:40,903
She's got a real
mind for this stuff.

76
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:43,089
They did labs, PET
scan, the works.

77
00:02:43,113 --> 00:02:47,115
Turns out I'm one in, like, a
bajillion kids to get chondrosarcoma.

78
00:02:47,184 --> 00:02:49,034
So, chemo and radiation
weren't an option.

79
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:50,618
You get points.

80
00:02:50,687 --> 00:02:52,788
Sweet. Hmm.

81
00:02:52,873 --> 00:02:55,740
Sorry.

82
00:02:55,809 --> 00:02:57,403
Hey, remember,
we said no crying.

83
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:58,927
I know. I'm sorry.

84
00:03:00,464 --> 00:03:02,108
There was a one-in-four
chance of recurrence,

85
00:03:02,132 --> 00:03:04,098
so it's not a huge shocker,

86
00:03:04,167 --> 00:03:08,287
but it is back, and it's
bigger than ever in my chest.

87
00:03:11,675 --> 00:03:13,595
We have our work cut
out for us, gentlemen.

88
00:03:15,295 --> 00:03:17,240
Uh, Robbins is
going out tonight.

89
00:03:17,264 --> 00:03:18,941
Do you want to maybe
come over when you're done?

90
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:20,832
Yeah. No, crap.
We have a Mer thing.

91
00:03:20,901 --> 00:03:22,045
Again? Yeah.

92
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:23,069
Come over after?

93
00:03:23,137 --> 00:03:24,314
Yes. Okay.

94
00:03:24,338 --> 00:03:26,071
Go. Fix your hair.

95
00:03:31,962 --> 00:03:33,623
Chest pains, huh? Yep.

96
00:03:33,647 --> 00:03:34,907
So, what's he doing
here? Kepner, I told you...

97
00:03:34,931 --> 00:03:37,015
I know you did, but
this is what's happening.

98
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:38,444
- I gave you a direct order.
- Come on, Hunt.

99
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:40,012
You've turned everyone
here against me.

100
00:03:40,036 --> 00:03:41,264
The least you can do
is let me frigging work.

101
00:03:41,288 --> 00:03:42,365
You have no business
being here at all!

102
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:44,122
Guys, come on.

103
00:03:44,191 --> 00:03:45,401
You know, I'm sick and
tired of hearing about it.

104
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:46,469
Why don't you find
someplace else to work?

105
00:03:46,493 --> 00:03:47,737
Oh, yay! Someone's hurt.

106
00:03:47,761 --> 00:03:49,861
Male, 55, complaining
of tightness in the chest.

107
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:51,324
Sir, do you have any
pain in your left arm?

108
00:03:51,348 --> 00:03:52,348
No, not really.

109
00:03:52,415 --> 00:03:53,676
My chest hurts
like hell, though.

110
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,949
Riggs, you can go. I got this.

111
00:03:55,018 --> 00:03:56,301
Chest pains. I'll take it.

112
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:57,813
Sir, what did you
eat this morning?

113
00:03:57,837 --> 00:03:59,437
A burrito. Two burritos.

114
00:03:59,506 --> 00:04:00,650
It's probably not surgical.

115
00:04:00,674 --> 00:04:02,473
I'll page someone
if it is. Let's go.

116
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:03,803
How about you let me do my job?

117
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:04,937
How about you
get the hell away...

118
00:04:04,961 --> 00:04:06,072
How about you both shut up?

119
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,249
Cover him!

120
00:04:11,769 --> 00:04:13,000
Oh, God!

121
00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:16,666
<i>Boom, I'll be in, I'll be out.</i>

122
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:18,735
These sessions
shouldn't take all that long.

123
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:22,944
But before we start, Doctor,
I was assigned your case,

124
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:24,846
and if you would prefer
a female therapist,

125
00:04:24,915 --> 00:04:26,982
I would be totally
comfortable with that.

126
00:04:27,051 --> 00:04:28,094
Oh, because it was a man

127
00:04:28,118 --> 00:04:29,617
who attacked me? Yeah.

128
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:31,786
And it's important that you feel

129
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:33,855
that you're with
the right person,

130
00:04:33,923 --> 00:04:36,742
that you feel comfortable,
that you get what you need.

131
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:38,588
I appreciate that. I'm fine.

132
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:40,590
I just need a tape-and-glue guy.

133
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:41,813
Tape and glue?

134
00:04:41,881 --> 00:04:45,249
Yeah, just, you know,
ask me a few questions

135
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:47,029
and patch me up and
send me on my way.

136
00:04:47,053 --> 00:04:48,953
I've been to therapy
before. Uh-huh.

137
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:50,533
I've dealt with the big stuff.

138
00:04:50,557 --> 00:04:53,037
This isn't the big stuff
that we're dealing with.

139
00:04:55,345 --> 00:05:00,882
Meredith, you were
attacked in your own hospital,

140
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:03,602
and you consider
that small stuff?

141
00:05:05,155 --> 00:05:07,088
Have you read my file?

142
00:05:18,452 --> 00:05:20,733
You're saying that
you've been through a lot.

143
00:05:20,771 --> 00:05:22,270
I am, and I have.

144
00:05:22,338 --> 00:05:24,183
My mother died of Alzheimer's.

145
00:05:24,207 --> 00:05:27,225
My stepmother
died of the hiccups.

146
00:05:27,294 --> 00:05:29,861
My sister died in a plane crash.

147
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:33,465
My husband was hit by a semi.

148
00:05:33,534 --> 00:05:36,117
That file, it's a
real page-turner.

149
00:05:37,755 --> 00:05:41,156
Meredith, something
terrible happened to you.

150
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:42,974
It did.

151
00:05:43,043 --> 00:05:44,754
And terrible things
happen every day.

152
00:05:44,778 --> 00:05:46,456
What the hell was...
- Coming through!

153
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,046
Oh, my God.

154
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:49,847
Shepherd, with me, Trauma Two.

155
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:52,044
All right, take him
into Trauma Three.

156
00:05:52,068 --> 00:05:53,968
Tell any incoming to
go somewhere else.

157
00:05:54,037 --> 00:05:55,648
Keep everyone out
of the ambulance bay.

158
00:05:55,672 --> 00:05:58,740
I need a trauma panel, lap
pads, and a surgical tray.

159
00:05:58,809 --> 00:06:01,169
- Someone notify the OR!
- Right away, Doctor.

160
00:06:02,162 --> 00:06:03,962
Hold on. You're next.

161
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,911
I should've gone somewhere else.

162
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:12,720
What the hell was that?

163
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:14,533
- Ambulance exploded.
- What?

164
00:06:14,557 --> 00:06:16,603
Partial thickness burns
to the upper chest.

165
00:06:16,627 --> 00:06:18,471
Follow the light with your eyes.

166
00:06:19,662 --> 00:06:20,761
Okay, good.

167
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:22,897
What happened?

168
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:24,344
Your rig exploded,
but don't worry.

169
00:06:24,368 --> 00:06:26,501
We've got you, okay?
You're gonna be okay.

170
00:06:26,569 --> 00:06:28,198
Oh, Shepherd, they
need you in Trauma One.

171
00:06:28,222 --> 00:06:29,388
Mmm-hmm.

172
00:06:29,456 --> 00:06:30,633
They figure out
why that rig blew up?

173
00:06:30,657 --> 00:06:32,051
Uh, fire department's
looking at it now.

174
00:06:32,075 --> 00:06:33,124
Oh, God.

175
00:06:33,192 --> 00:06:35,360
It was me.

176
00:06:35,429 --> 00:06:37,573
I didn't secure the oxygen tank.

177
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:39,898
Johnny's always saying...

178
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:41,349
He's gonna kill me.

179
00:06:41,418 --> 00:06:43,234
It was an accident,
he knows that.

180
00:06:44,021 --> 00:06:45,720
He's gonna kill me.

181
00:06:46,957 --> 00:06:49,907
Don't arch your neck. All right.

182
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:51,704
There's a lot of venous
blood in the upper chest.

183
00:06:51,728 --> 00:06:53,428
The lac extends
deep into the liver.

184
00:06:53,497 --> 00:06:55,274
Okay, let me get in there
and establish vascular control.

185
00:06:55,298 --> 00:06:56,809
No, we're gonna pack
him and take him up.

186
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,210
And then we'll be able to
see what the hell's going on.

187
00:06:58,234 --> 00:06:59,812
He's open right
now. Just let me work.

188
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:01,236
He is hemorrhaging like crazy.

189
00:07:01,304 --> 00:07:02,565
I'm not gonna let him
bleed out down here.

190
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:03,967
Suction. More laps.

191
00:07:03,991 --> 00:07:06,002
He's got a depressed skull
fracture. He needs a CT.

192
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:07,237
Look, Owen, you
know I can do this.

193
00:07:07,261 --> 00:07:08,501
Let me stabilize him.

194
00:07:08,545 --> 00:07:10,272
Riggs, this is the plan.
Get on board, or get out.

195
00:07:10,296 --> 00:07:11,324
Your plan's working great.

196
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:12,713
Better still, just get out.

197
00:07:12,782 --> 00:07:13,798
Kepner, over here.

198
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:15,483
To hell with this!

199
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:20,805
When you first woke
up after the attack,

200
00:07:20,874 --> 00:07:23,408
what is the first
thing you remember?

201
00:07:25,312 --> 00:07:26,552
People.

202
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:27,990
People running
around everywhere.

203
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:30,515
Who, specifically?

204
00:07:34,054 --> 00:07:35,887
It was pretty crazy.

205
00:07:37,324 --> 00:07:38,756
Oh. Thank you.

206
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:40,909
You, sir, have indigestion.

207
00:07:40,977 --> 00:07:42,755
DeLuca here will
get you an antacid.

208
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:47,959
Sorry, sir.

209
00:07:48,618 --> 00:07:51,286
And, uh, also schedule an
upper endoscopy, please.

210
00:07:54,091 --> 00:07:55,819
DeLuca, do you have
somewhere to be?

211
00:07:55,843 --> 00:07:57,283
No. Then put the
damn phone away.

212
00:07:59,012 --> 00:08:01,057
Okay, he'll, uh, get you
the rest of your meds,

213
00:08:01,081 --> 00:08:03,231
and you just sit tight, okay?

214
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:12,064
DeLuca!

215
00:08:14,044 --> 00:08:15,360
Torres is on her way.

216
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:17,261
Oh, okay, thanks.

217
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,531
Hey, uh, listen,
do you think tonight

218
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,482
maybe you and I
could just... I don't know.

219
00:08:21,551 --> 00:08:24,119
Oh, actually, I'm having
some people over tonight.

220
00:08:24,187 --> 00:08:26,604
It's... It's nothing big, just
Steph, Blake, and Warren.

221
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:27,673
Okay, yeah.

222
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:28,857
I mean, I get off late,

223
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:30,253
but I can pick up
something on the way home.

224
00:08:30,277 --> 00:08:32,143
No, I meant, uh,

225
00:08:32,212 --> 00:08:35,252
I'd kind of just like to spend
some time with my friends.

226
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:37,315
Oh.

227
00:08:37,384 --> 00:08:39,284
Yeah, no.

228
00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:40,730
I got something
later anyway, so...

229
00:08:40,754 --> 00:08:43,521
Oh, great, so you
have someplace to be.

230
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:45,990
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I
got someplace to be.

231
00:08:48,378 --> 00:08:49,394
Finally, uh...

232
00:08:49,463 --> 00:08:50,961
Can you, uh, look at these?

233
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:52,230
Mmm-hmm.

234
00:08:52,299 --> 00:08:53,809
So, how old is this patient?

235
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,600
Fifteen going on 35.

236
00:08:55,669 --> 00:08:57,519
Standard titanium plates, right?

237
00:08:57,587 --> 00:08:59,899
Unless her parents will go for a
stem-cell scaffolding in the chest.

238
00:08:59,923 --> 00:09:01,773
Well, it's, uh, just the mom,

239
00:09:01,841 --> 00:09:03,641
and, look, I don't
want to leave this girl

240
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,488
with an unprotected
heart for years.

241
00:09:05,512 --> 00:09:06,872
I need to make a recommendation.

242
00:09:06,896 --> 00:09:08,157
Well, we could look
into new technology.

243
00:09:08,181 --> 00:09:09,614
No, I want the safest option.

244
00:09:09,683 --> 00:09:10,948
Then you go with plates.

245
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:12,033
Tried and true.

246
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:18,156
So? Hit me.

247
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:21,726
Well, I, uh, consulted with
our ortho and cardio chiefs,

248
00:09:21,795 --> 00:09:25,997
and, uh, the best solution is a
titanium-plate sternum and ribcage.

249
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:27,109
Okay.

250
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:29,601
That's... That sounds good.

251
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:31,686
How many revision surgeries?

252
00:09:31,754 --> 00:09:35,190
Probably once a year
until you reach full growth.

253
00:09:35,275 --> 00:09:38,776
And if I get hit with, say,
even a Nerf ball to the chest?

254
00:09:38,845 --> 00:09:41,913
Well, we'll just be
very careful, won't we?

255
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:43,398
Just answer my question.

256
00:09:43,466 --> 00:09:45,000
It's very dangerous, yes.

257
00:09:45,068 --> 00:09:46,963
So, we're talking
multiple surgeries?

258
00:09:46,987 --> 00:09:49,227
You're just gonna open
and reopen my chest?

259
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:50,466
I'm... I'm sorry.

260
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:52,023
Can you explain what she...

261
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:53,558
A zipper scar.

262
00:09:55,662 --> 00:09:57,145
Oh.

263
00:09:57,213 --> 00:09:58,479
Oh, honey, I...

264
00:09:58,548 --> 00:09:59,931
We'll need to go in a few times,

265
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:02,199
but I assure you it's
the safest, best option.

266
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:04,452
I figured out how to do
it all on a leg and a half,

267
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:07,483
and now you want to limit
everything I do for my entire childhood?

268
00:10:07,507 --> 00:10:10,258
This is how you get the
rest of your childhood.

269
00:10:10,326 --> 00:10:11,892
I'm trying to save
your life, Maya.

270
00:10:11,961 --> 00:10:13,856
Sweetheart, we should
consider this. Maybe...

271
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,475
I went to three different
hospitals before I came here,

272
00:10:16,499 --> 00:10:18,044
and they all said
the same thing.

273
00:10:18,068 --> 00:10:20,501
They said, "Go to Grey
Sloan. Go to Dr. Karev."

274
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:23,971
So, now I'm here, and
this is all I get, just this?

275
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,489
I'm disappointed in you.

276
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:28,479
Dr. Karev, you're off my case.

277
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:29,661
I'm sorry?

278
00:10:29,729 --> 00:10:31,012
You're fired.

279
00:10:33,834 --> 00:10:35,733
<i>A terrible thing happened.</i>

280
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:37,835
I did get knocked around.

281
00:10:37,904 --> 00:10:39,370
But nobody died.

282
00:10:43,627 --> 00:10:47,061
And any day where nobody
dies, that's a good day.

283
00:10:51,885 --> 00:10:54,535
So, when you were laid up
healing, who visited you the most?

284
00:10:54,604 --> 00:10:55,903
Alex.

285
00:10:55,972 --> 00:10:57,989
<i>Remind me, Alex is...</i>

286
00:10:58,058 --> 00:11:00,219
<i>Alex is the one who
proposed to his girlfriend.</i>

287
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:01,976
Right. And she said no.

288
00:11:02,044 --> 00:11:04,123
Well, see, she didn't really
say no, and she didn't say yes,

289
00:11:04,147 --> 00:11:07,293
and then she booted him, and
then he came back to live with me.

290
00:11:07,317 --> 00:11:09,651
Alex was there when you woke up.

291
00:11:09,719 --> 00:11:13,488
I delivered him on
a silver platter to her.

292
00:11:13,556 --> 00:11:15,101
And he still managed
to screw it up.

293
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:16,402
Ugh. You said he
moved back in with her.

294
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:17,708
I mean, to the place.

295
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:19,122
They're together, but
they're not together,

296
00:11:19,146 --> 00:11:21,312
but they could
be together. It's...

297
00:11:21,381 --> 00:11:22,708
They're stupid.

298
00:11:22,732 --> 00:11:24,793
You have feelings for Alex?
Are you in love with Alex?

299
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:26,767
Do I have feelings for Alex?

300
00:11:26,836 --> 00:11:27,964
That's funny.

301
00:11:27,988 --> 00:11:29,253
No.

302
00:11:29,322 --> 00:11:31,089
I'm sorry.

303
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:34,425
I'm just trying to understand
why we're talking about them.

304
00:11:34,494 --> 00:11:37,595
Because he's being stupid.

305
00:11:39,048 --> 00:11:40,814
Uh, can she actually fire us?

306
00:11:40,883 --> 00:11:42,328
She's a kid. Oh, shut up.

307
00:11:42,352 --> 00:11:44,552
She's older than you
are, and she's smarter.

308
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:46,665
She'll cool off.
She'll come around.

309
00:11:46,689 --> 00:11:47,866
Go check my post-ops.

310
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:50,090
I've never been fired before.

311
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,376
Does this go on my
permanent record?

312
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:53,494
God.

313
00:11:55,165 --> 00:11:57,365
Look, you have to
stop paging me, okay?

314
00:11:57,434 --> 00:11:58,599
I'm getting in trouble now.

315
00:11:58,668 --> 00:12:00,146
I was trying to find
out if you were...

316
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:02,014
"You okay?" "Are you okay?"
"You okay?" Yes, I'm okay.

317
00:12:02,038 --> 00:12:03,154
Why wouldn't I be okay?

318
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:05,201
I thought you got blown
up by an ambulance.

319
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:06,791
What? I wasn't even...

320
00:12:08,695 --> 00:12:10,177
You were worried about me.

321
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:13,965
Aw.

322
00:12:18,521 --> 00:12:19,670
Oh, crap.

323
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,839
A consult. Mmm-mmm.

324
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:24,825
Mmm, okay. Now you're
getting me in trouble.

325
00:12:29,349 --> 00:12:30,415
Mmm.

326
00:12:37,023 --> 00:12:40,258
I mean, who cares if
DeLuca is an intern?

327
00:12:40,326 --> 00:12:42,460
It's all sexy and
secret at first,

328
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:44,812
and then it's just
a pain in the ass.

329
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,760
So, they should just
bring it out in the open.

330
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,600
That's what Derek and I did, and
we have three beautiful children.

331
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:53,388
And is Maggie the one in
AA? Or is she the hoverer?

332
00:12:53,456 --> 00:12:54,722
The hoverer.

333
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:56,357
That's the other thing.

334
00:12:56,426 --> 00:12:58,192
If she was getting it regular,

335
00:12:58,261 --> 00:13:01,062
maybe she would stop
hovering all the time.

336
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:05,393
Oh, sorry. Oh, hey.

337
00:13:05,935 --> 00:13:07,835
Um...

338
00:13:07,904 --> 00:13:10,154
How are you? Are
you... You good?

339
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:13,636
Did you hear about
the ambulance?

340
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:14,725
Oh, yeah, I know.

341
00:13:14,795 --> 00:13:16,310
That's so crazy, right?

342
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:20,047
Well, I mean, fire, O2 tanks,
poor maintenance, cigarettes.

343
00:13:20,116 --> 00:13:21,299
I'm sorry?

344
00:13:21,368 --> 00:13:24,569
Reasons ambulances explode.

345
00:13:24,638 --> 00:13:26,616
It happens all the time,
actually, which is weird,

346
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,273
considering that their
job is to not kill people...

347
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,860
but it happens just like...

348
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:36,380
Yeah, so, um,

349
00:13:37,851 --> 00:13:38,916
are you good?

350
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:40,701
I'm okay.

351
00:13:41,254 --> 00:13:43,070
Uh, I should...

352
00:13:45,008 --> 00:13:46,218
<i>I didn't screw them up.</i>

353
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:47,419
I was nice.

354
00:13:47,443 --> 00:13:48,942
Penny killed my husband.

355
00:13:49,011 --> 00:13:50,956
I took her in, I'm teaching her.

356
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:53,042
I am trying to make
something good out of it.

357
00:13:53,066 --> 00:13:55,377
That was very cool of
me. I didn't have to do that.

358
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:57,285
No, you didn't, but why did you?

359
00:13:57,353 --> 00:13:59,920
And now Callie thinks
I'm coming between them,

360
00:13:59,989 --> 00:14:02,018
and Blake thinks
so, too. I can feel it.

361
00:14:02,042 --> 00:14:03,282
And it's just not true.

362
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:05,843
I did not come
between their great love.

363
00:14:05,912 --> 00:14:07,211
Wasn't me.

364
00:14:08,298 --> 00:14:09,863
I'm sorry.

365
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:11,065
Who's Callie again?

366
00:14:11,134 --> 00:14:12,195
Callie is my friend in ortho.

367
00:14:12,219 --> 00:14:13,219
Ah, yeah.

368
00:14:13,286 --> 00:14:15,319
Come on, keep up.

369
00:14:16,555 --> 00:14:17,922
ICP is normalizing.

370
00:14:17,991 --> 00:14:19,390
This drain is doing the trick.

371
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:21,292
We'll observe him tonight,

372
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:23,205
and I'll take him up to the OR
tomorrow and repair the liver lac.

373
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:24,373
Kepner, you free?

374
00:14:24,397 --> 00:14:25,941
Uh, yeah. Just let
me know. Great.

375
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:28,143
I will scrub in and remove
the drain at the same time.

376
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:29,287
Thanks. Mmm-hmm.

377
00:14:31,738 --> 00:14:33,765
So, you still living
with Richard?

378
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:35,056
I'm crashing here.

379
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:37,444
It's a better commute.

380
00:14:39,262 --> 00:14:42,881
Amelia, you know
you can stay with me.

381
00:14:42,949 --> 00:14:45,533
It's not a good
idea for my sobriety.

382
00:14:45,601 --> 00:14:46,633
Right.

383
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:49,920
I'm gonna need dinner, though.

384
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:51,522
Great.

385
00:14:51,591 --> 00:14:52,990
Dinner tonight?

386
00:14:53,526 --> 00:14:54,625
Okay.

387
00:14:56,846 --> 00:14:58,491
So, Hunt and I will do
the liver lac tomorrow.

388
00:14:58,515 --> 00:14:59,947
How is the, uh, partner?

389
00:15:00,016 --> 00:15:01,048
Stable.

390
00:15:01,117 --> 00:15:02,617
Worried about his friend.

391
00:15:02,686 --> 00:15:04,686
You should have
cardio there, too,

392
00:15:04,754 --> 00:15:06,687
so bring in Riggs
just to be safe.

393
00:15:06,756 --> 00:15:07,833
Come on.

394
00:15:07,857 --> 00:15:09,089
I'm sorry?

395
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:12,760
You know there was an
explosion in the ER this morning.

396
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:14,607
I just really don't want to see

397
00:15:14,631 --> 00:15:17,031
another one over
an open patient.

398
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,283
You make a good point.

399
00:15:22,472 --> 00:15:23,615
Wait, so it all comes
out in one piece?

400
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:24,889
Exactly.

401
00:15:24,957 --> 00:15:26,356
That's so freaking cool.

402
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:29,577
What's going on?

403
00:15:29,646 --> 00:15:32,496
Oh, um, Dr. Karev, uh, these
two are gonna make me those.

404
00:15:32,565 --> 00:15:33,675
Pierce and I had an idea.

405
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:35,717
'Cause they're geniuses.

406
00:15:35,785 --> 00:15:37,512
Well, she kind of is, too.

407
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:39,787
It does sound pretty amazing.

408
00:15:39,856 --> 00:15:41,305
You just took over my case?

409
00:15:41,374 --> 00:15:43,991
She paged us for a consult.

410
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:48,328
Yeah, no offense, but
you're not my doctor anymore.

411
00:15:48,397 --> 00:15:51,248
But I think when you see
this, you're gonna want in.

412
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:52,477
Can we show him this?

413
00:15:52,501 --> 00:15:53,646
Yeah, mmm-hmm. - Yeah, hit it.

414
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:55,080
Okay, so, I can
excise Maya's tumors,

415
00:15:55,104 --> 00:15:57,455
but instead of the traditional
titanium reconstruction,

416
00:15:57,524 --> 00:15:59,507
I can 3D print a new
sternum and ribs.

417
00:15:59,576 --> 00:16:01,554
They'll be molded to her
exact body specifications

418
00:16:01,578 --> 00:16:02,838
so she can move
around more naturally.

419
00:16:02,862 --> 00:16:03,877
Have you ever done this?

420
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:05,507
It's only been done
once before on an adult,

421
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:06,709
but I can modify it for a child.

422
00:16:06,733 --> 00:16:08,449
Yeah, I'll be the first.

423
00:16:08,517 --> 00:16:10,952
I'll look like the
Terminator, which is badass.

424
00:16:12,421 --> 00:16:14,688
Can I see you two outside?

425
00:16:14,757 --> 00:16:17,436
You said yourself titanium
plates are the best option.

426
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:19,159
That was before
I knew that Callie

427
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:20,895
could print her her own ribcage.

428
00:16:20,964 --> 00:16:23,213
It will be fewer
surgeries in the long run.

429
00:16:23,282 --> 00:16:25,249
You're not experimenting
on some kid.

430
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:26,829
She may think she
knows what she wants,

431
00:16:26,853 --> 00:16:28,264
but she's not old enough
to understand the risks.

432
00:16:28,288 --> 00:16:30,404
She gets it. Trust me.

433
00:16:30,473 --> 00:16:32,156
I know a little something about

434
00:16:32,225 --> 00:16:34,174
being labeled too
smart for your age.

435
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:35,392
I love her.

436
00:16:35,445 --> 00:16:36,728
I'm not signing off on this.

437
00:16:36,796 --> 00:16:38,479
You're not on the case anymore,

438
00:16:38,548 --> 00:16:40,180
and her mom has
the consent forms.

439
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:42,193
Oh, you know as well as I
do she's freaking useless.

440
00:16:42,217 --> 00:16:43,384
I mean, you can't even...

441
00:16:43,452 --> 00:16:44,972
Karev, Karev. Hey.

442
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:50,124
Ms. Roberts, please.

443
00:16:50,193 --> 00:16:52,626
This is a dangerous
experimental procedure

444
00:16:52,695 --> 00:16:56,464
with zero proof that it'll work,
let alone keep your kid alive.

445
00:16:56,532 --> 00:16:59,233
Trust me when I tell you
you don't want to do this.

446
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:04,455
Please, Mom.

447
00:17:05,742 --> 00:17:07,174
It's what she wants.

448
00:17:18,905 --> 00:17:20,437
You swiped her.

449
00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:21,538
We didn't swipe her.

450
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:22,973
She fired you and asked us.

451
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,352
Look, no one's
looking out for this kid.

452
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:25,420
Not her mom, not anyone.

453
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:26,444
Um, we are, Alex.

454
00:17:26,512 --> 00:17:28,023
And I wouldn't have
even suggested it

455
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,508
if I didn't believe that it
was the best thing for her.

456
00:17:29,532 --> 00:17:31,276
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
No arguing. Fun.

457
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,633
Remember? Fun?

458
00:17:32,702 --> 00:17:34,735
For Meredith, for support.

459
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:36,170
I postponed sex for this.

460
00:17:36,239 --> 00:17:37,349
<i>Maggie's a hoverer.</i>

461
00:17:37,373 --> 00:17:38,639
God, she hovers all the time.

462
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:40,652
Does it bother
you, the hovering?

463
00:17:40,676 --> 00:17:42,643
No, she's just being
sisterly or whatever.

464
00:17:42,712 --> 00:17:43,844
Why would you say that?

465
00:17:43,913 --> 00:17:45,290
So, how long is
this going to last?

466
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:46,697
Come on. It's fun.

467
00:17:46,766 --> 00:17:47,915
I want to go to bed.

468
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:49,678
Well, I do, too,
and I can't go home.

469
00:17:49,702 --> 00:17:51,652
I don't want to go home alone.

470
00:17:51,721 --> 00:17:52,870
I miss Penny.

471
00:17:52,939 --> 00:17:54,105
I miss having sex.

472
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:55,789
Oh, Penny and I
had the greatest sex.

473
00:17:55,858 --> 00:17:57,475
It was that
journey-of-discovery,

474
00:17:57,543 --> 00:17:58,653
great sex you have
in the beginning.

475
00:17:58,677 --> 00:18:00,911
Jo and I had sex
like that all the time.

476
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:03,430
And now no Penny, no
sex. No sex with Penny.

477
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:04,698
Nothing.

478
00:18:04,767 --> 00:18:05,944
Okay, let's not talk about sex,

479
00:18:05,968 --> 00:18:07,217
because the chief is here.

480
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:09,019
I'm just eating my pizza.

481
00:18:09,089 --> 00:18:10,683
Besides, it sounds like none
of y'all are getting any anyway.

482
00:18:10,707 --> 00:18:12,017
- Pierce is getting some.
- No, I'm not.

483
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:13,385
Don't say that.
Forget he said that.

484
00:18:13,409 --> 00:18:14,425
So annoying.

485
00:18:14,494 --> 00:18:16,510
She has people
over all the time,

486
00:18:16,579 --> 00:18:18,729
like if I'm alone, I'll
explode or something.

487
00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:20,230
They won't go away.

488
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,915
Okay, but, guys,
really, you can go.

489
00:18:21,984 --> 00:18:23,062
No, we're here because it's fun.

490
00:18:23,086 --> 00:18:24,086
No, really, it's okay.

491
00:18:24,153 --> 00:18:25,330
Are you sure? I can...

492
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:27,015
'Cause you seem a
little... Cranky as hell?

493
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,333
Which is totally understandable

494
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:29,568
with everything
you've gone through.

495
00:18:29,592 --> 00:18:30,836
- Of course you would be.
- We're worried.

496
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,404
You don't have
to worry. We know.

497
00:18:32,428 --> 00:18:33,510
And I'm not cranky.

498
00:18:33,563 --> 00:18:34,595
I know.

499
00:18:34,664 --> 00:18:35,824
Except you are, all the time.

500
00:18:36,832 --> 00:18:38,443
<i>Do you want to be alone?</i>

501
00:18:38,467 --> 00:18:40,133
Well, I'm a widow.

502
00:18:40,203 --> 00:18:41,334
I'm good at it.

503
00:18:41,403 --> 00:18:42,964
I really just want... What?

504
00:18:42,988 --> 00:18:44,316
<i>Well, then tell them to go away.</i>

505
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:46,101
Well, no, because
they're just trying to help.

506
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,719
What do you want?
What can we do?

507
00:18:47,743 --> 00:18:49,827
<i>But they're not being helpful.</i>

508
00:18:49,896 --> 00:18:52,580
And it's all right for
you to tell them that.

509
00:18:53,682 --> 00:18:55,733
Leave my house.

510
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:56,802
Get out.

511
00:18:56,852 --> 00:18:58,235
I mean, thank you,

512
00:18:58,304 --> 00:19:00,505
but really, just go be with
whoever somewhere else

513
00:19:00,573 --> 00:19:01,939
so that I can go to sleep.

514
00:19:05,027 --> 00:19:06,076
Leave.

515
00:19:08,364 --> 00:19:10,030
You seem angry.

516
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:12,399
I'm not.

517
00:19:13,185 --> 00:19:14,385
My bad.

518
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:16,494
I took your advice.

519
00:19:16,555 --> 00:19:19,357
I kicked them all out
of my house last night.

520
00:19:19,425 --> 00:19:20,958
And?

521
00:19:21,026 --> 00:19:22,621
It worked. They left me alone.

522
00:19:22,645 --> 00:19:24,411
Well, that's what you wanted.

523
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,679
I know.

524
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:34,972
Hey. Dr. Webber.

525
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:36,551
Arizona's just gonna
be a second, so...

526
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,042
All right, thanks.

527
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,543
Hey, let's get a move on!

528
00:19:39,611 --> 00:19:41,306
Trivia's starting in 15 minutes!

529
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:42,529
Coming!

530
00:19:44,366 --> 00:19:46,016
Hey. You looking sharp.

531
00:19:46,085 --> 00:19:47,325
You got a hot date?

532
00:19:47,369 --> 00:19:49,314
Uh, yeah, something
like that. Hmm.

533
00:19:49,338 --> 00:19:51,772
She's, uh... We're
kind of keeping it quiet.

534
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,375
Oh, secret romance.

535
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:57,294
I'm guessing she
works at the hospital?

536
00:19:58,798 --> 00:19:59,897
I mean, she...

537
00:20:01,067 --> 00:20:02,366
Relax, son.

538
00:20:02,435 --> 00:20:03,700
I get it.

539
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:05,497
You know, it's been a few years,

540
00:20:05,521 --> 00:20:08,266
but if yours is anything like
mine was, keeping it a secret

541
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,991
makes it just that
much more exciting.

542
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:12,693
You know, you're totally right.

543
00:20:12,762 --> 00:20:15,390
I mean, she... She keeps it so
together in front of people at work,

544
00:20:15,414 --> 00:20:16,881
but then, when we're alone...

545
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:18,298
She's a wildcat, huh?

546
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:23,270
How do I look?

547
00:20:23,339 --> 00:20:24,416
Do I look hot?

548
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,951
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
you're very hot.

549
00:20:25,975 --> 00:20:27,575
Can we go now?

550
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:30,728
Thank you. Whoo.

551
00:20:30,797 --> 00:20:31,940
Okay. See you later.

552
00:20:31,964 --> 00:20:33,431
You have fun, too.

553
00:20:33,499 --> 00:20:35,044
All right, have fun
tonight, DeLuca. Thanks.

554
00:20:35,068 --> 00:20:37,802
Oh, and, uh, you
can't tame a wildcat.

555
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,872
It's infuriating.

556
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,574
Because I know that our problems

557
00:20:43,643 --> 00:20:45,476
haven't just
magically disappeared.

558
00:20:45,544 --> 00:20:46,755
Thanks. Mmm-hmm.

559
00:20:46,779 --> 00:20:48,659
Hey, uh, when are the
rest of the guys coming?

560
00:20:49,716 --> 00:20:51,181
This is it.

561
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,316
All right.

562
00:20:53,435 --> 00:20:55,035
Why did you let him move in?

563
00:20:55,104 --> 00:20:57,304
Because he showed up at my door

564
00:20:57,372 --> 00:20:59,506
all sad with his big, sweet face

565
00:20:59,575 --> 00:21:01,704
and made me forget everything
that was wrong with us.

566
00:21:01,728 --> 00:21:02,728
I know.

567
00:21:02,795 --> 00:21:04,255
I see Callie walking
down the hall.

568
00:21:04,279 --> 00:21:07,914
She and I are barely
talking, and I still get stupid.

569
00:21:07,983 --> 00:21:09,116
Ugh.

570
00:21:09,185 --> 00:21:10,628
I want to get stupid
over somebody.

571
00:21:10,652 --> 00:21:12,412
All I ever feel is smart. - Mmm.

572
00:21:12,454 --> 00:21:15,155
I just want to take his
dumb, gorgeous face,

573
00:21:15,224 --> 00:21:18,074
and I just... I want
to... I want to pummel it

574
00:21:18,143 --> 00:21:22,696
and kiss it and marry
it, and just pummel it.

575
00:21:22,765 --> 00:21:23,825
I get that, too.

576
00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:24,849
Mmm.

577
00:21:24,917 --> 00:21:26,044
Not the pummeling,
but the kissing.

578
00:21:26,068 --> 00:21:27,334
Mmm.

579
00:21:27,403 --> 00:21:29,431
I thought you didn't
even want to marry him?

580
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:31,905
I don't know what I
want. I can't be trusted.

581
00:21:31,974 --> 00:21:34,441
I wonder what guys want.

582
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:35,721
Hey, Warren, Warren.

583
00:21:35,745 --> 00:21:37,639
You're a guy. What do you want?

584
00:21:37,663 --> 00:21:38,862
Um...

585
00:21:38,931 --> 00:21:42,249
You know, that's,
uh... That's tough. Um...

586
00:21:42,317 --> 00:21:44,529
Did anybody see that an
ambulance blew up in the ER today?

587
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:46,554
No, we're serious.

588
00:21:46,622 --> 00:21:48,038
What do guys want?

589
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:50,853
What do guys want?

590
00:21:50,877 --> 00:21:52,142
Out of this conversation.

591
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:55,078
Oh, um...

592
00:21:56,916 --> 00:22:00,067
I just got an important
text, and I have to go.

593
00:22:00,136 --> 00:22:01,936
Oh, you are impossible.

594
00:22:02,004 --> 00:22:03,215
Oh, women are
just as impossible.

595
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:04,338
Really?

596
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:06,156
Look, I, uh...

597
00:22:06,225 --> 00:22:08,342
I can't speak for all men.

598
00:22:08,411 --> 00:22:11,691
I'm just a guy who wants
to go home to his wife.

599
00:22:12,631 --> 00:22:14,398
Sorry. Good night.

600
00:22:14,467 --> 00:22:16,567
Oh.

601
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:18,518
Screw Bailey.

602
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:22,105
Aw, she got the good one.

603
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:23,707
She did.

604
00:22:23,775 --> 00:22:24,895
Mmm.

605
00:22:25,611 --> 00:22:27,411
Ho-ho!

606
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,857
Looks like you owe
me another beer.

607
00:22:30,216 --> 00:22:31,481
Oh, hell.

608
00:22:31,551 --> 00:22:34,200
Hey, no one forced you to
take bets you couldn't win.

609
00:22:35,355 --> 00:22:36,803
What is the deal, Nathan?

610
00:22:38,741 --> 00:22:39,973
No deal.

611
00:22:40,476 --> 00:22:42,459
Go again?

612
00:22:42,528 --> 00:22:45,395
I talked about Owen dozens of
times when we were over there,

613
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:47,464
and you never even
mentioned knowing him.

614
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:49,517
Well, I didn't want
to talk about it.

615
00:22:49,585 --> 00:22:51,813
So, what, you guys have just,
like, always hated each other?

616
00:22:51,837 --> 00:22:53,671
I never hated him.

617
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:57,858
We became doctors together,
went through school, field training.

618
00:22:57,927 --> 00:22:59,237
There was no one I trusted more.

619
00:22:59,261 --> 00:23:00,460
We were like brothers.

620
00:23:00,529 --> 00:23:01,979
What happened?

621
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:04,948
You're up.

622
00:23:05,001 --> 00:23:06,812
Okay, so we're not
talking about this?

623
00:23:06,836 --> 00:23:08,552
We're playing darts.

624
00:23:13,442 --> 00:23:15,002
How'd you get so
good at darts anyway?

625
00:23:16,495 --> 00:23:18,175
You pick up some things

626
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,630
when you have no
reason to go home.

627
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,267
So, what are you gonna do?

628
00:23:23,335 --> 00:23:24,635
You gonna sign the papers?

629
00:23:26,622 --> 00:23:27,754
We're playing darts.

630
00:23:31,693 --> 00:23:33,160
Fine with me.

631
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:35,746
Hey, you ready? I'm starving.

632
00:23:35,815 --> 00:23:38,615
Listen, can we do
this another night?

633
00:23:38,684 --> 00:23:39,983
Uh, okay.

634
00:23:40,052 --> 00:23:41,580
I'm not hungry,
and I don't want to...

635
00:23:41,604 --> 00:23:42,815
What's wrong? Nothing, nothing.

636
00:23:42,839 --> 00:23:44,633
Just be better
another night, okay?

637
00:23:44,657 --> 00:23:45,850
Is this about Riggs?

638
00:23:45,874 --> 00:23:47,825
Can you...

639
00:23:47,894 --> 00:23:49,693
I'm not getting into it.

640
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:51,796
Everything doesn't
need to be talked about.

641
00:23:52,481 --> 00:23:53,580
Okay.

642
00:23:54,449 --> 00:23:56,083
Yeah, I understand.

643
00:23:56,151 --> 00:24:00,837
So, another time, you will
call me, and we'll go out.

644
00:24:00,906 --> 00:24:03,707
But you won't, will you?

645
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:05,554
Or you will and I
will cave and go

646
00:24:05,578 --> 00:24:08,662
and I will talk too much
and you will say nothing.

647
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:09,896
And I'm...

648
00:24:09,965 --> 00:24:12,327
I don't know how to
do this thing that you do

649
00:24:12,351 --> 00:24:14,346
where you make me feel like crap

650
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:17,371
and there are no words
coming out of your mouth.

651
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,738
So, whatever.

652
00:24:18,807 --> 00:24:21,641
You'll call me,
maybe, or maybe not.

653
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:24,411
And maybe I will not care.

654
00:24:29,635 --> 00:24:30,750
I had a sister.

655
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:36,072
Megan.

656
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:38,041
She was three years
younger than me.

657
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:42,078
Smarter than me, funnier than
me, better person than me, okay?

658
00:24:42,148 --> 00:24:43,947
But she did everything I did.

659
00:24:44,016 --> 00:24:47,167
We went to med school together,
and that's where we met Riggs.

660
00:24:47,236 --> 00:24:48,935
Nate was my best friend.

661
00:24:49,021 --> 00:24:50,821
And Megan loved him.

662
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:55,225
And he was with her
the day that we lost her.

663
00:24:57,196 --> 00:25:00,847
I trusted him with her, and
he was like a brother to me.

664
00:25:02,618 --> 00:25:04,385
And he should've...

665
00:25:06,822 --> 00:25:08,188
But he didn't.

666
00:25:12,728 --> 00:25:14,628
And I don't talk about it.

667
00:25:16,832 --> 00:25:17,992
Okay.

668
00:25:23,556 --> 00:25:24,922
Can I say one thing?

669
00:25:28,594 --> 00:25:29,843
She loved him.

670
00:25:29,911 --> 00:25:31,178
There's a reason.

671
00:25:31,247 --> 00:25:34,114
She loved him for a reason.

672
00:25:34,182 --> 00:25:36,950
That's what I hold on
to. Derek loved her.

673
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:41,021
Your sister loved Riggs.

674
00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:42,330
So, there's good in there.

675
00:25:43,292 --> 00:25:45,409
That makes him family.

676
00:25:45,477 --> 00:25:48,261
And that means that maybe
he deserves another chance.

677
00:25:56,588 --> 00:25:58,839
Are you still hungry?

678
00:26:00,075 --> 00:26:01,474
What are we eating?

679
00:26:01,543 --> 00:26:02,942
I could go for a pizza.

680
00:26:04,964 --> 00:26:06,196
Me, too.

681
00:26:15,457 --> 00:26:17,057
What are you doing here?

682
00:26:17,125 --> 00:26:18,308
Hanging.

683
00:26:18,377 --> 00:26:19,810
I kicked you off my case.

684
00:26:19,862 --> 00:26:22,880
I know. I'm not
gonna operate on you.

685
00:26:22,948 --> 00:26:24,314
Then what are you doing here?

686
00:26:25,217 --> 00:26:26,483
I'm holding your hand.

687
00:26:26,552 --> 00:26:29,686
Figured you'd want
someone to hold your hand.

688
00:26:29,755 --> 00:26:32,589
I mean, if you have
nothing better to do.

689
00:26:53,562 --> 00:26:56,079
Okay, Maya. We're ready to roll.

690
00:26:58,366 --> 00:26:59,566
Dr. Karev.

691
00:27:03,606 --> 00:27:05,289
All right, everybody,
clear the room.

692
00:27:05,358 --> 00:27:06,940
Give her a minute.

693
00:27:08,194 --> 00:27:09,354
Okay.

694
00:27:14,967 --> 00:27:16,211
You want me to get your mom?

695
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:20,738
No, no. She'll just freak out.

696
00:27:22,074 --> 00:27:25,241
She was practically my
age when she had me.

697
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,427
And she works two jobs to cover

698
00:27:27,495 --> 00:27:29,612
my bills and the good insurance.

699
00:27:30,916 --> 00:27:32,248
She tries.

700
00:27:34,353 --> 00:27:35,853
If something happens to me,

701
00:27:35,921 --> 00:27:37,966
will you tell her that there's
an envelope under my bed

702
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:41,492
with bank statements
and the deed to our house?

703
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,626
Just don't forget, okay?

704
00:27:43,695 --> 00:27:45,345
Hey, none of that.

705
00:27:49,634 --> 00:27:52,936
Oh, God, I don't want to die.

706
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:55,622
You're not gonna die.

707
00:27:55,690 --> 00:27:58,091
We both know you
can't promise anything.

708
00:28:11,706 --> 00:28:12,823
You good?

709
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,459
Yeah.

710
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:17,995
Let's do this.

711
00:28:18,898 --> 00:28:21,798
Um, do me a favor, though.

712
00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:24,550
If you're not too busy
making some kid a butthole,

713
00:28:25,754 --> 00:28:27,621
can you keep my mom company?

714
00:28:27,689 --> 00:28:29,122
Okay.

715
00:28:29,191 --> 00:28:30,523
Thank you.

716
00:28:32,611 --> 00:28:33,626
Okay.

717
00:28:51,413 --> 00:28:53,158
<i>You said you were
good at being alone.</i>

718
00:28:53,182 --> 00:28:55,132
Will you stop
saying what I said?

719
00:28:55,184 --> 00:28:56,283
Okay.

720
00:28:58,053 --> 00:28:59,335
So, why are you so angry?

721
00:29:00,806 --> 00:29:02,038
I'm not.

722
00:29:03,892 --> 00:29:04,941
Okay.

723
00:29:06,712 --> 00:29:08,311
So, how was it?

724
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:12,482
It was fine.

725
00:29:12,551 --> 00:29:16,019
I checked on the kids, I
read a book, I went to sleep.

726
00:29:16,855 --> 00:29:18,137
It was good advice.

727
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:21,992
I got what I needed. I...

728
00:29:22,061 --> 00:29:23,326
It was...

729
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:25,028
What?

730
00:29:26,031 --> 00:29:27,031
Mmm.

731
00:29:40,712 --> 00:29:42,579
They left me alone.

732
00:29:52,825 --> 00:29:54,641
You said the first
thing you remember

733
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:55,742
after the attack was...

734
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:56,850
Pain.

735
00:29:59,915 --> 00:30:01,365
Everything hurt.

736
00:30:01,416 --> 00:30:04,834
No, actually, you
said it was people.

737
00:30:04,903 --> 00:30:07,170
Everyone was there, you said.

738
00:30:07,238 --> 00:30:08,884
<i>Yeah. Every time
I opened my eyes,</i>

739
00:30:08,908 --> 00:30:10,757
<i>it was like the
freaking</i> Wizard of Oz.

740
00:30:10,843 --> 00:30:12,175
<i>Everyone was there.</i>

741
00:30:12,244 --> 00:30:13,671
<i>Maggie was there,
Richard was there.</i>

742
00:30:13,695 --> 00:30:15,596
<i>They were there to help.</i>

743
00:30:15,664 --> 00:30:17,344
I mean, they were
doing their jobs.

744
00:30:18,367 --> 00:30:19,799
Just being good doctors?

745
00:30:19,868 --> 00:30:21,584
Yeah, doing their jobs.

746
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:22,830
Looking good. Drain is out.

747
00:30:22,854 --> 00:30:23,937
So am I.

748
00:30:24,005 --> 00:30:25,316
All right, wound vac is out.

749
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:27,100
Let's remove the liver packing.

750
00:30:30,445 --> 00:30:32,262
Damn it. Blood's not clotting.

751
00:30:32,331 --> 00:30:33,331
Laps.

752
00:30:33,381 --> 00:30:34,481
Clamp.

753
00:30:34,549 --> 00:30:36,011
Clamp what? I can't see a thing.

754
00:30:36,035 --> 00:30:37,545
There, right there. APRIL:
Wait, where are you going?

755
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:39,264
Clamp what? There's too much
blood. That, that. Right there.

756
00:30:39,288 --> 00:30:40,732
Clamp there. APRIL:
Okay. All right, all right.

757
00:30:40,756 --> 00:30:42,083
Okay, I got the IVC,
but he's still bleeding.

758
00:30:42,107 --> 00:30:43,785
There's too much damage.
- More laps.

759
00:30:43,809 --> 00:30:45,720
Keep packing. Faster, faster.
- I'm trying.

760
00:30:45,744 --> 00:30:47,322
I'm gonna have to open him up.
- Wait, what?

761
00:30:47,346 --> 00:30:48,824
- Scissors. Betadine.
- Why? Why?

762
00:30:48,848 --> 00:30:50,330
He needs a venovenous bypass.

763
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:51,709
Have you ever done that before?
- In the field.

764
00:30:51,733 --> 00:30:53,467
Come on, there's no time.

765
00:30:53,535 --> 00:30:54,829
Well, okay, then we're gonna
need another set of hands.

766
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:56,053
Someone page Pierce.

767
00:30:56,121 --> 00:30:57,320
No. Riggs. Get Riggs.

768
00:30:57,389 --> 00:30:58,550
Are you sure you want...

769
00:30:58,574 --> 00:31:00,855
Somebody get Riggs!
- Right away.

770
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:01,959
Scalpel.

771
00:31:02,027 --> 00:31:03,126
Thank you.

772
00:31:14,606 --> 00:31:15,806
All right, template.

773
00:31:23,132 --> 00:31:24,397
Okay. Bone saw.

774
00:31:38,463 --> 00:31:40,229
Okay, hang more
FFP and platelets.

775
00:31:40,298 --> 00:31:41,481
Keep compressions.

776
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:42,694
Got it. I got it.

777
00:31:42,718 --> 00:31:44,518
There's damage to
the retrohepatic IVC.

778
00:31:44,586 --> 00:31:46,381
- The liver is just...
- Yeah, I got it.

779
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:47,749
All right, you want to do
an end around the liver?

780
00:31:47,773 --> 00:31:48,983
That is what I was thinking.

781
00:31:49,007 --> 00:31:50,351
Okay, set up the Bio-Pump.

782
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:51,719
We're gonna need venous cannulas.
- On it.

783
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:52,675
You got the portal? - Yep.

784
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:54,544
I'll get the SVC.

785
00:31:54,613 --> 00:31:55,790
Here. NATHAN: Cheers.

786
00:31:55,814 --> 00:31:56,841
Hunt called for him?

787
00:31:56,865 --> 00:31:57,926
Yeah, this could get ugly.

788
00:31:57,950 --> 00:32:00,217
If you want, I can...

789
00:32:00,286 --> 00:32:02,126
Clamps. NATHAN: Forceps.

790
00:32:05,023 --> 00:32:06,100
Okay, I'm gonna need...

791
00:32:06,124 --> 00:32:07,124
Metz.

792
00:32:13,248 --> 00:32:14,888
Potts. OWEN: Mmm-hmm.

793
00:32:17,719 --> 00:32:18,985
We're gonna need to do a...

794
00:32:19,053 --> 00:32:21,721
Purse string after bypass.
- Mmm-hmm.

795
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:23,823
I can help you
guys if you need it.

796
00:32:23,892 --> 00:32:25,776
Here, you can hold the cannulas.

797
00:32:25,844 --> 00:32:27,077
Okay.

798
00:32:27,146 --> 00:32:28,544
And set here.

799
00:32:29,281 --> 00:32:30,463
And go.

800
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:34,300
Lines up.

801
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:35,602
Clamping.

802
00:32:40,776 --> 00:32:41,896
There you go.

803
00:32:41,943 --> 00:32:42,959
All right.

804
00:32:43,028 --> 00:32:44,708
Good. OWEN: Okay.

805
00:32:47,182 --> 00:32:48,676
Good. NATHAN: Set.

806
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:51,234
- And three, two, one.
- Three, two, one.

807
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,908
Flow.

808
00:33:01,313 --> 00:33:02,378
Not bad.

809
00:33:04,098 --> 00:33:06,032
3-0 Prolene.

810
00:33:14,192 --> 00:33:18,211
Meredith, how
did it feel for you?

811
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:21,898
You know, stuck there, can't
move, can't hear, can't speak,

812
00:33:21,966 --> 00:33:24,567
just watching everyone?

813
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:27,770
Crappy.

814
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:29,050
You use that word a lot.

815
00:33:29,074 --> 00:33:31,007
Can you try a different one?

816
00:33:31,076 --> 00:33:34,277
I don't know. Open,
exposed, alone.

817
00:33:34,346 --> 00:33:35,745
Yeah, but you weren't alone.

818
00:33:37,115 --> 00:33:38,915
They were all there.

819
00:33:54,666 --> 00:33:56,933
They all had you.

820
00:33:57,002 --> 00:33:58,551
So, I ask once again,

821
00:34:00,054 --> 00:34:01,521
how did it feel for you?

822
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:02,590
Yeah.

823
00:34:02,657 --> 00:34:04,907
Crappy really is the best word.

824
00:34:10,132 --> 00:34:11,164
Wow.

825
00:34:13,668 --> 00:34:14,801
Thank you.

826
00:34:16,255 --> 00:34:17,336
Okay.

827
00:34:24,229 --> 00:34:26,596
Oh, shoot!

828
00:34:26,664 --> 00:34:27,931
Shoot. Damn it!

829
00:34:27,999 --> 00:34:29,465
What? What's going on?

830
00:34:29,534 --> 00:34:31,079
- It's... It's not fitting.
- How is that possible?

831
00:34:31,103 --> 00:34:32,246
It's custom-made for her.

832
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:33,398
No, it's... The rib's fine.

833
00:34:33,422 --> 00:34:34,854
It's like a fitted
sheet on a bed.

834
00:34:34,923 --> 00:34:36,033
You know, once
you attach one side...

835
00:34:36,057 --> 00:34:37,685
The other side pops out.

836
00:34:37,709 --> 00:34:39,620
Yeah, and another set's
gonna take 14 hours to print.

837
00:34:39,644 --> 00:34:41,472
Can we leave her open for that long?
- No, no.

838
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:44,680
It will leave her at risk
for post-op infection, clots.

839
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:45,998
So, now what?

840
00:34:46,085 --> 00:34:47,217
Uh...

841
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:54,451
They want to
retract her rib cage,

842
00:34:54,475 --> 00:34:56,654
pull it open to make enough
space for the new ribs to fit.

843
00:34:56,678 --> 00:34:58,211
No.

844
00:34:58,279 --> 00:35:01,280
I mean, they could slip and
puncture her lung and her heart.

845
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:03,011
We know. Or crack her ribs.

846
00:35:03,035 --> 00:35:05,079
And if she's under too long,
they'll never get her off the vent.

847
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:07,170
Alex, either this or we
go back to the plates.

848
00:35:07,222 --> 00:35:09,155
Which is exactly
what she doesn't want.

849
00:35:09,224 --> 00:35:12,304
That's why they wanted to
check before they went ahead.

850
00:35:13,745 --> 00:35:15,206
I don't want to wake
her up and ask her.

851
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:17,163
She signed a consent.

852
00:35:17,232 --> 00:35:18,881
We don't need her permission.

853
00:35:18,951 --> 00:35:21,071
They want to check with you.

854
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:23,904
My mom was just like her.

855
00:35:23,972 --> 00:35:25,738
I had to take
care of everything.

856
00:35:25,807 --> 00:35:28,967
Makes a girl glad she was
left in a stroller at a fire station.

857
00:35:33,332 --> 00:35:34,380
Made you tough.

858
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:36,133
Hmm.

859
00:35:40,055 --> 00:35:41,788
Maya's tough.

860
00:35:41,857 --> 00:35:43,356
She can do it.

861
00:35:44,459 --> 00:35:45,570
<i>Okay, on my count.</i>

862
00:35:45,594 --> 00:35:47,627
One, two, three.

863
00:35:50,165 --> 00:35:51,259
Careful not to
compress her heart.

864
00:35:51,283 --> 00:35:52,498
I'm trying.

865
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:54,228
Wilson, I know that you
can pull harder than that.

866
00:35:54,252 --> 00:35:55,680
Okay. CALLIE: Again.

867
00:35:55,704 --> 00:35:57,344
One, two, three.

868
00:35:57,389 --> 00:35:59,217
- Come on.
- Okay, come on.

869
00:36:01,175 --> 00:36:02,253
Oh, crap.

870
00:36:02,277 --> 00:36:03,593
She's been under too long.

871
00:36:03,645 --> 00:36:05,765
She's fluid overloaded.
Her heart's beginning to fail.

872
00:36:07,131 --> 00:36:08,197
And done here.

873
00:36:08,266 --> 00:36:09,532
Good?

874
00:36:09,601 --> 00:36:11,368
Kepner, would you
finish up closing?

875
00:36:11,436 --> 00:36:13,714
Uh, yeah. Yeah, of course.
- Great.

876
00:36:13,738 --> 00:36:15,038
Uh... That was...

877
00:36:15,107 --> 00:36:16,389
Insane.

878
00:36:16,458 --> 00:36:17,902
Have you ever seen
anything like that?

879
00:36:17,926 --> 00:36:20,994
It's like they formed
one super-surgeon.

880
00:36:24,632 --> 00:36:26,866
That was a thing of beauty.

881
00:36:26,935 --> 00:36:29,069
It was like watching ballet.

882
00:36:29,137 --> 00:36:32,355
Uh, Kepner, I think
you owe me an apology.

883
00:36:35,176 --> 00:36:37,288
Just because we
saved a patient together

884
00:36:37,312 --> 00:36:38,845
doesn't mean things are back...

885
00:36:38,913 --> 00:36:40,747
Do I, though?

886
00:36:40,816 --> 00:36:42,232
I don't trust you.

887
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:43,962
You didn't screw this
up because I was there.

888
00:36:43,986 --> 00:36:45,268
If I wasn't there...

889
00:36:45,337 --> 00:36:46,614
Whoa, whoa, whoa, stop!

890
00:36:46,638 --> 00:36:48,104
Yeah, okay.

891
00:36:48,173 --> 00:36:50,890
So, you can tell
me what to do...

892
00:36:52,727 --> 00:36:56,162
All I know is when they're all
at my house, I want them gone.

893
00:36:56,231 --> 00:36:59,432
And then, when they
leave, I don't feel any better.

894
00:36:59,501 --> 00:37:00,878
So, what, does
that make me crazy?

895
00:37:00,902 --> 00:37:02,342
I was gonna say it
makes you human.

896
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:05,683
I am very good at being alone.

897
00:37:05,707 --> 00:37:08,007
I've taught myself how to do it.

898
00:37:08,076 --> 00:37:09,187
And I don't mean my kids.

899
00:37:09,211 --> 00:37:10,977
I love my kids.

900
00:37:11,046 --> 00:37:13,512
And I have my class and my work.

901
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:16,483
I have moved on.

902
00:37:16,551 --> 00:37:20,252
You see, but a widow
really hasn't moved on.

903
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:21,738
She's still sort of married.

904
00:37:21,807 --> 00:37:24,023
She's just married
to a dead guy.

905
00:37:24,092 --> 00:37:25,859
You're not married anymore.

906
00:37:25,927 --> 00:37:27,993
And you're not a widow anymore.

907
00:37:28,981 --> 00:37:30,614
So, what are you?

908
00:37:45,413 --> 00:37:46,880
I don't know.

909
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:02,979
Okay, so what happens now?

910
00:38:03,048 --> 00:38:04,797
I don't know.

911
00:38:04,866 --> 00:38:05,932
<i>That's up to you.</i>

912
00:38:10,738 --> 00:38:12,805
She did great.

913
00:38:12,874 --> 00:38:15,194
They were able to do
exactly what she wanted.

914
00:38:15,477 --> 00:38:16,976
You can go in.

915
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:20,346
She just looks so...

916
00:38:22,567 --> 00:38:23,945
Well, why don't you
go get some coffee

917
00:38:23,969 --> 00:38:24,969
and meet us back here

918
00:38:25,036 --> 00:38:26,347
when you've had some time, okay?

919
00:38:28,473 --> 00:38:30,006
Oh.

920
00:38:30,075 --> 00:38:31,315
Come on.

921
00:38:33,911 --> 00:38:35,728
Surgical incision looks good.

922
00:38:35,797 --> 00:38:37,630
I put her on a Lasix drip,

923
00:38:37,699 --> 00:38:39,927
and I'll be back in an hour
to check her I's and O's.

924
00:38:39,951 --> 00:38:41,451
Thanks.

925
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,619
Okay.

926
00:38:47,609 --> 00:38:48,975
Your mom will be back soon.

927
00:38:50,078 --> 00:38:52,045
Check this out, Iron Man.

928
00:38:54,132 --> 00:38:56,315
You were a badass today.

929
00:39:01,188 --> 00:39:03,322
We can keep going.

930
00:39:03,391 --> 00:39:06,626
Or I feel good.

931
00:39:06,694 --> 00:39:08,862
You feel good? I don't.

932
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:12,966
I mean, I feel comfortable
signing the papers for Dr. Bailey.

933
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:16,452
You show no signs of PTSD.

934
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:20,689
And you're certainly capable
of taking care of your patients

935
00:39:20,758 --> 00:39:22,692
and yourself.

936
00:39:22,761 --> 00:39:24,543
But I feel terrible.

937
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:26,924
I came in here,
and I felt great.

938
00:39:26,948 --> 00:39:30,316
And now I don't know
who I am or what I want.

939
00:39:30,385 --> 00:39:33,186
Well, you wanted a
tape-and-glue guy.

940
00:39:33,254 --> 00:39:36,138
And I think you're
holding up pretty well.

941
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:43,863
Richard. Pierce.

942
00:39:43,932 --> 00:39:45,142
DeLuca. Good night.

943
00:39:45,166 --> 00:39:46,750
Sir. Night.

944
00:40:05,286 --> 00:40:07,237
You're really bad at this.

945
00:40:07,305 --> 00:40:09,145
You should have gotten a woman.

946
00:40:09,457 --> 00:40:10,957
What do I do now?

947
00:40:11,026 --> 00:40:12,491
I don't know.

948
00:40:25,189 --> 00:40:26,239
I miss you.

949
00:40:41,156 --> 00:40:44,090
Meredith, you got really
good at being alone.

950
00:40:46,528 --> 00:40:49,829
But something terrible
happened to you,

951
00:40:49,898 --> 00:40:52,131
and they were all there.

952
00:40:54,468 --> 00:40:56,452
And they still are.

953
00:40:59,174 --> 00:41:03,876
Are you saying I can't
be alone anymore?

954
00:41:03,945 --> 00:41:05,444
No, I think you can.

955
00:41:06,781 --> 00:41:08,564
I just don't think
you want to be.

956
00:41:14,021 --> 00:41:15,354
Can we go?

957
00:41:15,423 --> 00:41:16,989
No, he's... He's coming.

958
00:41:17,058 --> 00:41:18,191
He's coming.

959
00:41:18,259 --> 00:41:19,499
What do you have to do?

960
00:41:20,495 --> 00:41:21,575
Oh, you have someone to do.

961
00:41:22,681 --> 00:41:24,696
We are not talking about that.

962
00:41:26,667 --> 00:41:27,766
Are you okay?

963
00:41:27,835 --> 00:41:29,035
Finally.

964
00:41:31,056 --> 00:41:32,121
What?

965
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:34,668
Oh, come on.

966
00:41:34,692 --> 00:41:36,892
It's been a long
day. Can we just...

967
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:43,015
<i>You told me that any day</i>

968
00:41:43,084 --> 00:41:45,485
<i>someone doesn't
die is a good day.</i>

969
00:41:45,553 --> 00:41:47,886
<i>You are alive.</i>

970
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:51,124
<i>So, have a good day.</i>

971
00:41:51,192 --> 00:41:52,492
What are we doing?

972
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:53,592
Do you want to hang out?

973
00:41:54,478 --> 00:41:57,113
But what the hell do I do now?

974
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:01,934
Well, the truth
is a little scary.

975
00:42:03,137 --> 00:42:05,305
The truth is,

976
00:42:05,373 --> 00:42:07,640
you can do anything you want.

977
00:42:09,277 --> 00:42:11,177
What do you want to do?
