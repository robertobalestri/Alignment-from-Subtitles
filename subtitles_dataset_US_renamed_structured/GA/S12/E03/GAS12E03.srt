1
00:00:07,558 --> 00:00:09,658
<i>The body is a
bundle of possibility.</i>

2
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,979
<i>Every time we cut one open,</i>

3
00:00:14,048 --> 00:00:16,114
<i>we're faced with a
series of decisions.</i>

4
00:00:25,392 --> 00:00:27,158
<i>Some choices are made for you.</i>

5
00:00:28,295 --> 00:00:29,628
You don't have to knock.

6
00:00:31,064 --> 00:00:33,798
Morning. How'd you sleep?

7
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:35,234
I'm not doing
this another night,

8
00:00:35,302 --> 00:00:37,302
not sleeping on that
damn couch again.

9
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:38,481
Great. You shouldn't.

10
00:00:38,505 --> 00:00:40,083
You've got a perfectly
fine bed right here...

11
00:00:40,107 --> 00:00:42,741
I have been really nice, April.

12
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:45,277
All right, but it's
time now, okay?

13
00:00:45,346 --> 00:00:48,146
I told you a week ago
to look for a place to live.

14
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:50,159
You haven't. Because
we have a place to live.

15
00:00:50,183 --> 00:00:53,184
So, today, I'm gonna book
you a room at the Archfield.

16
00:00:53,254 --> 00:00:54,552
Tonight, I will come home,

17
00:00:54,621 --> 00:00:56,404
I will help you finish packing,

18
00:00:56,473 --> 00:01:01,676
and, tomorrow, I'm gonna
wake up alone, in my bed.

19
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:04,819
For better or for
worse, Jackson.

20
00:01:05,382 --> 00:01:07,032
For better or for worse.

21
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:11,502
<i>But for the most part,</i>

22
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:15,040
<i>surgery is a
choose-your-own-adventure.</i>

23
00:01:15,109 --> 00:01:17,042
I'm here. I'm here.

24
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:23,748
I know you're mad. I am
so, so sorry. We can go.

25
00:01:25,285 --> 00:01:28,253
Amelia's not here. Ha!

26
00:01:28,322 --> 00:01:31,072
Amelia's the late
one. It's not on me.

27
00:01:31,141 --> 00:01:33,942
Oh, um, I got the mail. I think
that your contract is in there.

28
00:01:36,647 --> 00:01:38,112
Come on.

29
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:39,247
I'm the good sister.

30
00:01:39,315 --> 00:01:40,555
I'm the good sister.

31
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:44,102
Chief of General Surgery. Yay.

32
00:01:47,525 --> 00:01:49,725
Shut up, I'm here. Whoo!

33
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:52,794
Okay.

34
00:01:55,015 --> 00:01:56,264
Are you naked?

35
00:01:57,717 --> 00:01:58,717
Oh, my God.

36
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,118
I won't be in five minutes.

37
00:02:00,187 --> 00:02:01,420
Don't you wear panties?

38
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:03,182
No way. She likes to breathe.

39
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:06,224
Please tell me your naked butt is
not on the seat of my brand-new car.

40
00:02:06,276 --> 00:02:08,054
Are you done
looking or are you...

41
00:02:08,078 --> 00:02:10,307
Amelia, my children
sit back there.

42
00:02:10,331 --> 00:02:13,098
You only have a problem
if they lick the seats.

43
00:02:13,167 --> 00:02:14,227
Do they lick the seats?

44
00:02:14,251 --> 00:02:15,812
She did not just say that.

45
00:02:15,836 --> 00:02:17,797
Just start the car
and drive already.

46
00:02:17,821 --> 00:02:20,200
If I didn't care so much
about the planet for my babies,

47
00:02:20,224 --> 00:02:23,725
this carpool would
not even be happening.

48
00:02:23,794 --> 00:02:25,422
Meredith finally got
her contract. Whoo!

49
00:02:25,446 --> 00:02:26,545
It's official.

50
00:02:26,614 --> 00:02:28,647
Lady chief trifecta.

51
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:30,515
Way to go.

52
00:02:30,584 --> 00:02:32,951
The house of lady chiefs.

53
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,260
Sister lady chiefs.

54
00:02:34,288 --> 00:02:35,420
Put a bra on!

55
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:38,229
What was that? Hmm?

56
00:02:38,608 --> 00:02:39,707
What was what?

57
00:02:39,776 --> 00:02:41,816
That face, you just made a face.

58
00:02:43,564 --> 00:02:44,629
I don't make faces.

59
00:02:44,698 --> 00:02:47,533
You did. You just
made a face like this.

60
00:02:49,937 --> 00:02:51,820
No, I don't think so.

61
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,573
You made a face.

62
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:01,379
Sadie, what's up?

63
00:03:01,448 --> 00:03:02,547
Can I go home now?

64
00:03:02,616 --> 00:03:04,082
Did you poop yet?

65
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:06,184
Alex, come on.

66
00:03:06,253 --> 00:03:10,455
I'm eating, I'm walking. I'm
gonna miss the entire third grade.

67
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:12,669
You poop, you
go, that's the deal.

68
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:14,637
And what did I say
about calling me Alex?

69
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:18,029
I'll call you Dr. Karev when
you say I can go home, Alex.

70
00:03:22,987 --> 00:03:24,530
You're making that face again.

71
00:03:24,554 --> 00:03:27,489
I didn't make a
face, I just, um...

72
00:03:27,557 --> 00:03:31,693
There's a party for, uh, someone I
know who's getting married, Ethan.

73
00:03:31,762 --> 00:03:33,561
Ethan is getting married.

74
00:03:33,631 --> 00:03:34,763
Who's Ethan?

75
00:03:34,832 --> 00:03:36,676
Maggie's ex-boyfriend, Ethan.

76
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:39,079
From radiology, exceptional
ass, even in scrubs.

77
00:03:39,103 --> 00:03:41,447
Come on, they dated for
like six months last year.

78
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:43,154
Right, you were AWOL.

79
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,057
So, someone invited you

80
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:47,792
to your ex-boyfriend's wedding?

81
00:03:47,861 --> 00:03:49,194
That's so rude.

82
00:03:49,263 --> 00:03:50,529
Maggie, you okay?

83
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:53,915
About what? BOTH: Ethan.

84
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:57,302
Oh, what? Oh, please. Uh...

85
00:03:58,138 --> 00:04:00,121
Good for Ethan.

86
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:02,274
What do I care? I have surgery.

87
00:04:04,594 --> 00:04:06,994
Yeah, she's not okay.

88
00:04:07,081 --> 00:04:08,530
Breathe.

89
00:04:08,598 --> 00:04:11,477
Hi, Laurie, Mason. I'm
Dr. Robbins, this is Dr. Warren.

90
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:12,679
How are we doing? Good.

91
00:04:12,703 --> 00:04:15,019
He's good. I'm
being split in half.

92
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,755
And our OB's on vacation.

93
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:18,635
Okay, can I look at
the ultrasound, please?

94
00:04:18,659 --> 00:04:19,791
Don't tell us the sex.

95
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:21,003
Twins wasn't surprise enough?

96
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:22,761
It was for me. He was thrilled.

97
00:04:23,631 --> 00:04:26,064
Oh, wow.

98
00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:27,978
Uh, it looks like
they're fighting to see

99
00:04:28,002 --> 00:04:29,813
which one's gonna
come out first.

100
00:04:31,505 --> 00:04:34,439
Okay, so you need
to page Karev 911.

101
00:04:34,508 --> 00:04:36,625
Okay, let's get these
babies out of here.

102
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,237
Dr. Karev, I was
told to come find you?

103
00:04:38,261 --> 00:04:39,839
Yeah, you're with me
today. I'm swamped.

104
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:41,808
Just try to keep up.
With you on peds?

105
00:04:41,832 --> 00:04:43,209
Great. Is that a problem?

106
00:04:43,233 --> 00:04:44,298
No, no.

107
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:45,845
What, you hate
kids or something?

108
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:48,236
No, I don't hate kids. Uh...

109
00:04:48,304 --> 00:04:49,638
What, then?

110
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:52,541
Just peds isn't my first
choice as a specialty.

111
00:04:52,609 --> 00:04:53,909
Shouldn't have said that.

112
00:04:53,977 --> 00:04:56,723
Perfect, she gives me the one
who hates kids. Thanks, Mer.

113
00:04:56,747 --> 00:04:58,391
All right, pick up whatever
labs I've got pending

114
00:04:58,415 --> 00:04:59,714
and meet me in L&D.

115
00:05:02,786 --> 00:05:04,151
I don't hate kids.

116
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:05,431
You got it. Push, push, push.

117
00:05:05,455 --> 00:05:07,233
You got it, hon.

118
00:05:07,257 --> 00:05:08,367
All right, we
have a little girl.

119
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:09,925
Okay, I'm here.

120
00:05:09,993 --> 00:05:11,537
We have a girl. Can we see her?

121
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:13,573
No, there's another baby
right behind her, okay?

122
00:05:13,597 --> 00:05:14,730
So, we just have to...

123
00:05:14,798 --> 00:05:16,798
Hey, congratulations,
I'm Dr. Karev.

124
00:05:16,867 --> 00:05:18,144
All right, here we go, Laurie.

125
00:05:18,168 --> 00:05:19,584
Apgar's six.

126
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:21,297
Baby's jaundiced and
in respiratory distress.

127
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,737
All right, call the NICU.

128
00:05:22,806 --> 00:05:24,467
Tell them to have an umbilical
line and vent on standby.

129
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:26,735
Okay, Laurie, push, push.

130
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:28,026
Push, push. Okay.

131
00:05:28,095 --> 00:05:30,162
All right, and
there's a little boy.

132
00:05:34,634 --> 00:05:35,634
Hey, you got him?

133
00:05:35,685 --> 00:05:37,845
Yeah, I'll see you in CT.

134
00:05:41,525 --> 00:05:43,208
Can we hold them?

135
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:46,995
Um, yeah, not just yet.

136
00:05:47,064 --> 00:05:48,541
Babies are looking
a little jaundiced,

137
00:05:48,565 --> 00:05:50,465
so Dr. Karev's gonna
take them up to the NICU

138
00:05:50,534 --> 00:05:51,950
and see what might be going on.

139
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:53,568
Laurie, you did great.

140
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:03,829
Oh, wow.

141
00:06:04,981 --> 00:06:06,948
When did you find out?

142
00:06:07,016 --> 00:06:08,182
This morning.

143
00:06:08,985 --> 00:06:10,117
How do you feel?

144
00:06:10,921 --> 00:06:12,554
Like I want to puke.

145
00:06:15,091 --> 00:06:17,325
What did Alex say?

146
00:06:17,393 --> 00:06:19,928
I haven't talked to him yet.

147
00:06:19,996 --> 00:06:21,524
You have to talk to him. Do I?

148
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:22,992
It's not like I wanted
this to happen.

149
00:06:23,016 --> 00:06:24,782
Jo, you have to talk to him.

150
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:26,184
I know.

151
00:06:29,072 --> 00:06:30,822
The boy's in CT 2.

152
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:32,518
Come on, come on, come on.

153
00:06:32,542 --> 00:06:34,182
Got your labs. What
are we dealing with?

154
00:06:34,211 --> 00:06:35,343
Newborn twins.

155
00:06:35,412 --> 00:06:37,190
Don't talk to Deluca,
he hates kids.

156
00:06:37,214 --> 00:06:39,692
What do you have against
kids? I don't hate kids.

157
00:06:39,716 --> 00:06:41,094
Scans up yet?
No, they're coming.

158
00:06:41,118 --> 00:06:43,168
Deluca hates kids. Hurry up.

159
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:45,048
Could be wrong.
We could be wrong.

160
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:46,421
About what?

161
00:06:54,047 --> 00:06:56,815
Um, pull up the
little girl's now.

162
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:03,548
And for the record,
I don't hate kids.

163
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,067
Deluca, just shut
your stupid mouth.

164
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:06,241
Damn it.

165
00:07:07,744 --> 00:07:10,028
Damn it.

166
00:07:11,398 --> 00:07:12,847
Can you tell me
what just happened?

167
00:07:14,568 --> 00:07:16,228
You see that? Uh-huh.

168
00:07:16,252 --> 00:07:17,763
The boy has a
tumor on his liver.

169
00:07:17,787 --> 00:07:19,865
So does the girl, same tumor.

170
00:07:19,889 --> 00:07:21,434
Both invading the
kidneys, both causing

171
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:22,698
early heart failure.

172
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:23,986
What happened is they have to go

173
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:25,287
tell a mother and a father

174
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:28,551
that both of their
newborn babies are dying.

175
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:46,931
Both of them?

176
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,200
They're just babies.

177
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:50,735
This has to be
some kind of mistake.

178
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:53,182
They can't have cancer.
You can't be born with cancer.

179
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:55,740
Hepatoblastoma is a
common liver cancer in kids.

180
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:57,742
It's also very aggressive.

181
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:59,460
The tumors are already
causing problems

182
00:07:59,529 --> 00:08:01,696
for your kids' kidneys,
hearts, and lungs.

183
00:08:01,765 --> 00:08:04,165
That's why I'm
recommending liver transplants.

184
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:05,316
Oh, God.

185
00:08:05,385 --> 00:08:07,113
We asked not to
see the ultrasound.

186
00:08:07,137 --> 00:08:09,482
We didn't want to know the
sex. We wanted to be surprised.

187
00:08:09,506 --> 00:08:10,866
Did we... No, no.

188
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:12,173
Laurie, this is not your fault.

189
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:14,792
Your OB likely
wouldn't have caught it.

190
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:16,961
It's okay. It's okay. Uh...

191
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:18,062
Just...

192
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:20,781
What do we do now?

193
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:23,312
The next step is that we get
them on the universal donor list,

194
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,819
and we try to find them donors.

195
00:08:24,888 --> 00:08:26,966
What about us? Can we be donors?

196
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:28,934
Absolutely, we'll test you
to see if you're a match.

197
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:30,352
Yes, right now. We want to.

198
00:08:32,079 --> 00:08:33,689
Warren, Deluca,
make that happen,

199
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:36,058
and I'll see you
down in the pit.

200
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:38,816
You should know that
they are in very good hands.

201
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:40,251
Dr. Karev is amazing.

202
00:08:43,056 --> 00:08:44,288
Hey.

203
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:46,457
Hey.

204
00:08:48,795 --> 00:08:49,906
What's the matter?

205
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:50,945
Nothing.

206
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:57,451
Do you want to have kids?

207
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:02,540
I don't, uh, know.

208
00:09:03,726 --> 00:09:07,094
Yeah, I... Do you... Now?

209
00:09:07,163 --> 00:09:09,046
Or ever?

210
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:11,633
I don't know, just is it
something that you want?

211
00:09:11,701 --> 00:09:14,486
Yeah, now or ever.

212
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:17,956
God, Alex, it's a simple
yes-or-no question.

213
00:09:18,025 --> 00:09:19,652
What the hell is going on?

214
00:09:19,676 --> 00:09:20,920
Nothing.

215
00:09:20,944 --> 00:09:22,076
I just...

216
00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:25,263
Nothing.

217
00:09:29,786 --> 00:09:31,352
Hey. Hey.

218
00:09:31,421 --> 00:09:33,332
You're a department head. Will
you take a look at this contract

219
00:09:33,356 --> 00:09:35,701
for me and tell me if
anything looks weird to you.

220
00:09:35,725 --> 00:09:36,891
Sure.

221
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:44,181
There it is, the face.

222
00:09:44,985 --> 00:09:46,150
What face?

223
00:09:46,219 --> 00:09:47,263
Maggie made a face,

224
00:09:47,287 --> 00:09:49,031
and now you're making a face.

225
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:50,934
What is it about my
contract that makes people

226
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:52,198
make that face?

227
00:09:52,225 --> 00:09:53,774
You know what, I...

228
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:56,411
I don't like talking
money with friends.

229
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,157
We're not talking money, Callie.

230
00:09:58,181 --> 00:09:59,421
Are we talking money?

231
00:10:02,085 --> 00:10:05,003
I think they lowballed
you a little. A lot.

232
00:10:05,072 --> 00:10:06,321
Why do you think that?

233
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:09,631
Because I make a
lot more than you.

234
00:10:10,593 --> 00:10:12,160
Yeah, like a lot more than you.

235
00:10:12,229 --> 00:10:13,694
Like a lot more.

236
00:10:15,332 --> 00:10:17,215
Well, how much? Meredith.

237
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,217
Give me a number.

238
00:10:23,072 --> 00:10:24,839
And I just think,
like, can't you just be

239
00:10:24,908 --> 00:10:26,307
civil and rational?

240
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:28,309
But she won't listen to
anything I have to say.

241
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:29,889
Now she's decided
that this is the hill

242
00:10:29,913 --> 00:10:31,312
that she's got to die on.

243
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:33,092
Of course that hill is
my living room, so...

244
00:10:33,116 --> 00:10:35,383
Look, yeah, I'm
with Robbins today,

245
00:10:35,452 --> 00:10:37,452
and Karev has these
twins, so I need...

246
00:10:37,521 --> 00:10:39,020
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, no, go.

247
00:10:39,089 --> 00:10:40,488
Okay. Yeah.

248
00:10:45,528 --> 00:10:47,061
Hey, look.

249
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:49,263
Uh, if, you know... If you
need to get out of there

250
00:10:49,332 --> 00:10:50,709
or you need a
couch to crash on...

251
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:52,478
Oh, no, no. Not a chance.

252
00:10:52,502 --> 00:10:54,862
Thanks, but no.
She's out tonight.

253
00:10:54,921 --> 00:10:56,833
'Cause I mean, if
I leave, she wins.

254
00:10:56,857 --> 00:10:59,217
You know, she does
not win my living room.

255
00:11:00,477 --> 00:11:03,327
See? I mean,
that's not civil, right?

256
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:07,231
Little girl's going
into renal failure.

257
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,311
Boy's lungs are
crapping out fast.

258
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,655
Maybe we'll get lucky and
the parents will be a match.

259
00:11:14,908 --> 00:11:17,120
Jo hit me up about
having kids today

260
00:11:17,144 --> 00:11:18,776
out of absolutely nowhere.

261
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:21,190
Is that what happens? You
shack up, and then suddenly

262
00:11:21,214 --> 00:11:23,054
your ovaries go into overdrive?

263
00:11:23,116 --> 00:11:25,133
Aw, I think you'll
be a good dad.

264
00:11:25,202 --> 00:11:27,718
Your babies will be so
foul-mouthed and dirty and cute.

265
00:11:29,339 --> 00:11:31,872
I just didn't think
we were there yet.

266
00:11:31,942 --> 00:11:33,324
I don't know if I am.

267
00:11:33,393 --> 00:11:35,273
Definitely didn't think she was.

268
00:11:35,696 --> 00:11:37,996
Alex.

269
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:40,504
What? What if
you're already there?

270
00:11:41,684 --> 00:11:43,729
What if she's asking 'cause
she's already knocked up,

271
00:11:43,753 --> 00:11:45,703
and she's just
testing the waters?

272
00:11:45,772 --> 00:11:48,017
Why would you even say that?

273
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,674
We tested the parents.
The results are back.

274
00:11:50,744 --> 00:11:53,378
Mason, you are a match
to do a directed donation.

275
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:55,474
Thank God. Okay.

276
00:11:58,435 --> 00:12:00,768
That's good, right?

277
00:12:00,837 --> 00:12:03,683
Why don't you look
like that's good news?

278
00:12:03,707 --> 00:12:05,439
Um, Laurie,

279
00:12:05,509 --> 00:12:08,404
I'm afraid that you're
not a viable candidate.

280
00:12:08,428 --> 00:12:10,461
We still have
one. I'll split it.

281
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:12,213
I'm afraid we can't.

282
00:12:12,282 --> 00:12:14,093
The lobe of your liver
that we have to take is...

283
00:12:14,117 --> 00:12:15,800
We'll need two donors.

284
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:17,963
Wait.

285
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:20,622
What happens if
we don't find one?

286
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:22,006
One of the babies dies?

287
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:24,525
We're talking to UNOS,
and we're hoping...

288
00:12:24,594 --> 00:12:26,477
I don't want to hope.

289
00:12:26,546 --> 00:12:28,191
I want to know that I
won't have to choose

290
00:12:28,215 --> 00:12:30,226
between my babies.
Laurie, shh, it's okay.

291
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,477
It's not okay.

292
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:32,645
Don't tell me that it's okay.

293
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:34,263
At least there's
something that you can do.

294
00:12:34,287 --> 00:12:35,581
It's not your fault.
Look, we have one.

295
00:12:35,605 --> 00:12:37,116
Let's just be grateful
that we have one.

296
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:38,380
I know it's not my fault.

297
00:12:39,542 --> 00:12:40,987
You wanted to be surprised.

298
00:12:41,011 --> 00:12:42,455
You didn't want to know the sex.

299
00:12:42,479 --> 00:12:43,856
Okay, they said it wouldn't
have made a difference...

300
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,240
Well, maybe it would have!

301
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:49,283
Maybe there was something
that I could have done then...

302
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:52,431
I am their mother, and I
can't do anything to help them.

303
00:12:52,455 --> 00:12:54,489
Stop yelling at me
for being able to.

304
00:12:54,557 --> 00:12:56,485
It's not my fault. Well,
then, you decide, Mason.

305
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:58,287
You tell these doctors
which one of our children

306
00:12:58,311 --> 00:12:59,388
has to die because...

307
00:12:59,412 --> 00:13:00,945
You're not deciding, I am.

308
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,513
You can't make a
decision like this.

309
00:13:05,568 --> 00:13:07,685
You shouldn't have
to. That's why I'm here.

310
00:13:07,753 --> 00:13:10,054
I'll evaluate, I decide.

311
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:11,767
The baby that I see is
stronger, is doing better,

312
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,742
has the better chance to
thrive will get the donation.

313
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:16,093
And the other one?

314
00:13:18,948 --> 00:13:20,665
Will get the next one.

315
00:13:22,235 --> 00:13:24,752
And we will do everything
that we can to find it.

316
00:13:26,622 --> 00:13:28,222
And the rest you put on me.

317
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:46,691
Bailey? Bailey
did you like this?

318
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:49,060
I mean, who knew
Bailey was the man?

319
00:13:49,129 --> 00:13:50,639
Mmm, you know what?
They lowballed you

320
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,107
'cause you're an in-house hire.

321
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:53,275
They knew you
wouldn't push back.

322
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:54,776
I thought the offer was fair.

323
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,278
I mean, for me, it
wasn't about the money.

324
00:13:56,302 --> 00:13:57,446
Bailey said she needed me.

325
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:59,081
The job just fell in my lap.

326
00:13:59,105 --> 00:14:01,089
Uh-uh.

327
00:14:01,157 --> 00:14:03,891
No, you earned that job, okay?

328
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,320
You need to go
back and renegotiate.

329
00:14:08,114 --> 00:14:09,180
I can't, it's too late.

330
00:14:09,249 --> 00:14:10,548
I already accepted the offer.

331
00:14:10,616 --> 00:14:12,628
No, walk in there and
demand what you deserve.

332
00:14:12,652 --> 00:14:14,313
Men do it all the time.

333
00:14:14,337 --> 00:14:16,015
They walk in, they
adjust their man parts,

334
00:14:16,039 --> 00:14:17,215
they get more money.

335
00:14:17,239 --> 00:14:18,901
Mmm-hmm. Yeah, we all did it.

336
00:14:18,925 --> 00:14:21,070
I did it real good.
I mean, I got...

337
00:14:21,094 --> 00:14:22,137
I make a lot more than you.

338
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:23,401
I know. You said that.

339
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:28,966
Okay, so, I mean, what's
the worst they can say? "No"?

340
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:31,369
I mean, I'd just go
back to my old job.

341
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:33,148
No. You can't go back.

342
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:35,467
You'd have to move
to another hospital.

343
00:14:35,491 --> 00:14:36,568
Maybe another state.

344
00:14:39,495 --> 00:14:40,995
Maggie, what do you think?

345
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:44,983
Oh, don't ask me.

346
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:46,679
I make terrible choices.
I can't be trusted.

347
00:14:46,703 --> 00:14:48,602
I could be having sex right now.

348
00:14:48,672 --> 00:14:52,556
What? Six months of
my life dating that man.

349
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:54,375
Six months, that
is an investment.

350
00:14:54,443 --> 00:14:56,087
What? MAGGIE: He was nice.

351
00:14:56,111 --> 00:14:57,461
Ethan. Oh.

352
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:58,974
He was funny, he
was cute, he was sexy.

353
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:00,064
He was sexy, right?

354
00:15:00,133 --> 00:15:01,766
Mmm, very.

355
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:03,534
He was. Sweet ass.

356
00:15:03,603 --> 00:15:04,603
No idea.

357
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:06,537
Empirically sexy.

358
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:09,107
And the sex, I mean...

359
00:15:11,311 --> 00:15:14,545
First prize in the
talent competition

360
00:15:14,613 --> 00:15:15,879
and the long jump,

361
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:17,509
if you know what I'm saying.

362
00:15:17,533 --> 00:15:21,185
But, you know, he spit just
a little bit when he talked,

363
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:24,789
and he said, "All-timers"
instead of Alzheimer's.

364
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:28,309
And I got bored. And I
slid away, I let it fizzle out.

365
00:15:28,378 --> 00:15:31,111
And then within
another six months,

366
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,980
he finds someone else

367
00:15:33,049 --> 00:15:35,483
he's ready to spend
the rest of his life with?

368
00:15:35,551 --> 00:15:37,952
I get that. That can happen.

369
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:40,254
I make terrible choices.

370
00:15:40,322 --> 00:15:44,175
I leave things behind and
just let the bridges burn.

371
00:15:44,244 --> 00:15:46,761
I did it with Ethan,
I did it with Dean.

372
00:15:48,515 --> 00:15:49,747
Oh, my God.

373
00:15:50,684 --> 00:15:52,116
I did it with my entire life.

374
00:15:54,988 --> 00:15:57,738
One day, I chose to learn a
little bit about my birth mother.

375
00:15:57,807 --> 00:16:00,107
Cut to, I live in her
house with her daughter,

376
00:16:00,176 --> 00:16:03,038
and I work with the kind
stranger who fathered me,

377
00:16:03,062 --> 00:16:04,778
and I left behind an entire life

378
00:16:04,847 --> 00:16:07,798
and family that
no longer exists.

379
00:16:07,867 --> 00:16:09,633
My parents are divorced.

380
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:11,635
My childhood home is sold.

381
00:16:11,704 --> 00:16:14,638
My mother is in Hawaii
making soups now.

382
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,208
I have no home.

383
00:16:17,276 --> 00:16:19,138
It's like I flew to this planet

384
00:16:19,162 --> 00:16:21,078
on an exploratory mission,

385
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:24,715
and the Earth blew up behind me

386
00:16:25,785 --> 00:16:27,151
and I can't go back.

387
00:16:27,219 --> 00:16:30,788
And now I'm here
with you aliens.

388
00:16:30,857 --> 00:16:34,491
Except I'm the alien,
and I'm all alone,

389
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,727
and I have nothing,
and no one wants me.

390
00:16:37,596 --> 00:16:39,313
That...

391
00:16:41,067 --> 00:16:42,500
You got us. We want you.

392
00:16:42,569 --> 00:16:44,619
I can't have sex with you.

393
00:16:44,687 --> 00:16:46,253
No.

394
00:16:46,322 --> 00:16:49,223
You're a Cylon.

395
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:50,925
This is <i>Galactica.</i>

396
00:16:52,228 --> 00:16:54,128
I really do like her.

397
00:16:54,197 --> 00:16:56,274
She makes me
not the crazy sister.

398
00:16:56,298 --> 00:16:57,743
What do you think
they're paying her?

399
00:17:09,795 --> 00:17:11,762
Why are you doing that?

400
00:17:12,715 --> 00:17:14,615
Because people eat dinner.

401
00:17:14,684 --> 00:17:16,679
Not people who are moving out.

402
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:18,147
April, you're supposed
to be packing.

403
00:17:18,171 --> 00:17:21,222
I'm not leaving because I
told you I'm not giving up.

404
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,791
If you want to trade nights
on the couch, we can do that.

405
00:17:23,859 --> 00:17:25,326
But I'm not moving
out of my home.

406
00:17:25,394 --> 00:17:27,439
It's my home. It's my...

407
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:30,309
Oh, I hate that you are
forcing me to say this stuff.

408
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:32,467
April, okay, it's my
name on the lease.

409
00:17:32,535 --> 00:17:34,780
It's my place. You moved
in, and you moved out.

410
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:37,054
No, I didn't move out.

411
00:17:37,123 --> 00:17:39,206
I went away, and
then I came back.

412
00:17:39,275 --> 00:17:40,525
And I am sorry.

413
00:17:40,593 --> 00:17:44,111
I am truly sorry that
I wasn't here for you.

414
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:45,691
But I thought if we
had some space...

415
00:17:45,715 --> 00:17:47,431
I need space now!

416
00:17:49,686 --> 00:17:50,918
You see?

417
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:52,665
Right now, I really just wanted

418
00:17:52,689 --> 00:17:54,800
to have my burrito
and go to sleep.

419
00:17:54,824 --> 00:17:56,507
Save it, I made dinner.

420
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:57,799
What is it, boiled bunny?

421
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:00,761
'Cause you sound crazy.

422
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,507
Okay, I feel like a hostage.

423
00:18:02,531 --> 00:18:04,092
But like a reverse hostage
where the kidnapper

424
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:06,678
just follows me everywhere
and won't leave my damn house.

425
00:18:06,702 --> 00:18:08,252
You know what they call that?

426
00:18:08,321 --> 00:18:09,987
Marriage.

427
00:18:10,055 --> 00:18:12,689
And it gets hard, but
you don't just leave.

428
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,207
You don't just stop.

429
00:18:14,276 --> 00:18:16,577
You do. You do just stop.

430
00:18:16,646 --> 00:18:17,789
You know what they call that?

431
00:18:17,813 --> 00:18:18,813
Divorce.

432
00:18:19,615 --> 00:18:21,482
What?

433
00:18:21,551 --> 00:18:24,431
Tomorrow morning, when you go to
work, I'm having the locks changed.

434
00:18:24,487 --> 00:18:26,554
Yeah, tomorrow night
when I get home from work,

435
00:18:26,622 --> 00:18:28,155
I'm bringing a crowbar!

436
00:18:28,224 --> 00:18:30,784
Listen to yourself.

437
00:18:32,495 --> 00:18:36,864
Two babies, two
tumors, one liver.

438
00:18:36,933 --> 00:18:39,214
How's Karev supposed
to make a call like that?

439
00:18:40,236 --> 00:18:42,570
Well, first,

440
00:18:42,638 --> 00:18:45,072
he'll try to avoid having
to make the call at all.

441
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:46,957
He'll try to find another donor.

442
00:18:47,026 --> 00:18:49,304
Call UNOS every 20 minutes
until they have something.

443
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:51,162
<i>He'll bug UNOS...</i>

444
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:52,941
And call every hospital,
their transplant teams...

445
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,498
<i>Comb the hospital,</i>

446
00:18:54,567 --> 00:18:58,636
<i>every hospital in Seattle
for a matching liver.</i>

447
00:18:58,704 --> 00:19:02,873
<i>Then he'll do a physical
evaluation of each baby</i>

448
00:19:02,941 --> 00:19:06,109
<i>to look for any
other malformations,</i>

449
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:10,847
<i>see which one seems
healthier overall.</i>

450
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:13,317
<i>Then he'll do a
full lab work-up,</i>

451
00:19:13,386 --> 00:19:15,653
<i>go over and over the results,</i>

452
00:19:15,722 --> 00:19:19,891
<i>look for any other possible
co-existing problems,</i>

453
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:24,662
<i>like a kidney disease
or heart anomalies.</i>

454
00:19:24,731 --> 00:19:27,965
<i>At this point, he's hoping
to find something wrong.</i>

455
00:19:28,034 --> 00:19:29,366
Hey. I'm here.

456
00:19:29,435 --> 00:19:31,118
<i>And if he's smart,</i>

457
00:19:31,186 --> 00:19:34,054
<i>he's got someone
double checking his work.</i>

458
00:19:34,123 --> 00:19:36,323
<i>And then it's down to
the tumors themselves.</i>

459
00:19:36,392 --> 00:19:38,837
What's the distance of the
tumor of the Cantlie line?

460
00:19:38,861 --> 00:19:40,127
Eight millimeters.

461
00:19:40,195 --> 00:19:42,173
Yeah, I know I just
called, but this infant

462
00:19:42,197 --> 00:19:44,510
is on a timeframe,
so if you just...

463
00:19:44,534 --> 00:19:46,550
Yes, I'll hold.

464
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:49,553
Check and recheck every scan.

465
00:19:49,622 --> 00:19:53,191
See if they involve
more than one lobe.

466
00:19:53,259 --> 00:19:56,994
If there's infiltration
of other structures.

467
00:19:57,063 --> 00:20:01,132
You just don't give up
until you find your answer.

468
00:20:12,227 --> 00:20:13,461
Yeah.

469
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:17,297
How can I help?

470
00:20:17,366 --> 00:20:19,566
Take a look at the labs again.

471
00:20:25,925 --> 00:20:28,092
We're screwed. The
labs are the same.

472
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,927
The staging is the same.

473
00:20:29,996 --> 00:20:32,462
Both tumors are
causing renal failure.

474
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:35,532
Okay, what about the measurements?
The girl's tumor's bigger.

475
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:38,113
The boy's is smaller, but it's
invading the left hepatic vein.

476
00:20:38,137 --> 00:20:40,070
One's too big, the other
one's too complicated.

477
00:20:40,139 --> 00:20:41,789
It's a dead freaking heat.

478
00:20:41,857 --> 00:20:44,991
You need food and
a shower and sleep.

479
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:48,100
You need to walk away
for a minute. I'm serious.

480
00:20:48,881 --> 00:20:50,747
Let's go. Go.

481
00:20:55,188 --> 00:20:56,920
Try UNOS again. Yeah.

482
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:04,562
Hey.

483
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:08,532
All-nighter?

484
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:10,234
Yeah.

485
00:21:11,971 --> 00:21:15,722
And I need to go back, I just
need a couple hours' sleep.

486
00:21:16,258 --> 00:21:17,591
Can we talk?

487
00:21:20,062 --> 00:21:21,178
Yeah.

488
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:23,680
Okay, yeah.

489
00:21:33,742 --> 00:21:36,627
Are you... I found this...

490
00:21:36,695 --> 00:21:40,214
When I was unpacking,
I wasn't snooping.

491
00:21:40,282 --> 00:21:42,428
I know it's kind of none
of my business, but...

492
00:21:42,452 --> 00:21:45,986
I picked it up. And then I
just couldn't put it down.

493
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:47,821
Okay, this.

494
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:49,440
You have babies?

495
00:21:49,509 --> 00:21:51,759
No, no, these were embryos.

496
00:21:53,428 --> 00:21:54,828
With Izzie?

497
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:57,030
Listen, Izzie wanted
to freeze her eggs.

498
00:21:57,099 --> 00:21:59,500
She needed them fertilized.
I did it, she froze them.

499
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:01,902
That's all. "That's all"?

500
00:22:01,971 --> 00:22:04,438
Yeah, then she left me.
That's all. You can toss it.

501
00:22:07,994 --> 00:22:11,274
So, you wanted to
have babies with her?

502
00:22:12,415 --> 00:22:13,780
Yeah, I...

503
00:22:14,817 --> 00:22:17,050
I don't know, I mean, it was...

504
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,452
It was 100 years ago.

505
00:22:20,123 --> 00:22:23,090
I'm just asking because
when I asked you

506
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:24,625
if you wanted to
move in with me,

507
00:22:24,694 --> 00:22:26,159
you said that you did

508
00:22:26,228 --> 00:22:27,723
and that you could
picture a life with me,

509
00:22:27,747 --> 00:22:30,163
but you never said
anything about babies.

510
00:22:30,232 --> 00:22:33,400
You said, "Maybe
we could get a dog."

511
00:22:33,469 --> 00:22:34,580
Do you want a dog?

512
00:22:34,604 --> 00:22:36,520
No, I want to know
what we're doing here.

513
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:39,856
I love you, and you love me.

514
00:22:39,925 --> 00:22:41,592
I know, but when I look ahead...

515
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:42,704
Why are we looking ahead?

516
00:22:42,728 --> 00:22:44,048
If you had or maybe you do have,

517
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:45,879
for all I know, a
bunch of Izzie babies

518
00:22:45,948 --> 00:22:47,325
walking around with
your face on them...

519
00:22:47,349 --> 00:22:48,677
And why are we doing it now?

520
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:52,052
And I'm just the
"Let's get a dog" girl?

521
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:54,755
I'm wondering what you
think we are, what you want.

522
00:22:54,824 --> 00:22:56,567
Look, I didn't have
babies with Izzie.

523
00:22:56,591 --> 00:22:59,037
My role in that whole thing
was with a cup and a magazine.

524
00:22:59,061 --> 00:23:00,861
But you would have.

525
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:02,780
You wanted to.

526
00:23:02,848 --> 00:23:05,966
She was worth it to you.

527
00:23:06,035 --> 00:23:08,235
But when I ask you if
you want to have babies,

528
00:23:08,304 --> 00:23:10,754
you're all, "I don't
know, yes, no, maybe."

529
00:23:10,823 --> 00:23:12,089
She was my wife.

530
00:23:12,157 --> 00:23:13,835
We were married.
That's my point.

531
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:15,520
What am I? She had cancer.

532
00:23:15,544 --> 00:23:16,755
She didn't even know if
she was gonna be able to

533
00:23:16,779 --> 00:23:18,012
after the radiation.

534
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,325
No, don't do... What, I
have to get sick to figure out

535
00:23:20,349 --> 00:23:22,709
if you're gonna
go all in with me?

536
00:23:24,487 --> 00:23:25,613
And now you're gonna go.

537
00:23:25,637 --> 00:23:27,737
Yes.

538
00:23:27,806 --> 00:23:30,173
And you're right, it's kind
of none of your business.

539
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:31,591
And I'm not doing this!

540
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,972
I'm not talking about babies
that I didn't have with Izzie

541
00:23:33,996 --> 00:23:36,063
or may or may not have with you.

542
00:23:36,131 --> 00:23:38,165
I have two real babies
I'm responsible for

543
00:23:38,233 --> 00:23:39,277
at the hospital right now.

544
00:23:39,301 --> 00:23:41,234
I have enough
kids to take care of.

545
00:23:53,299 --> 00:23:55,266
Hey.

546
00:23:55,334 --> 00:23:57,968
How did you negotiate
your contract?

547
00:23:58,036 --> 00:23:59,670
What?

548
00:23:59,739 --> 00:24:02,016
I mean, what did they offer? You
were coming from private practice,

549
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,791
so you had a salary
you could leverage.

550
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:05,454
How much was that? Mer, stop it.

551
00:24:05,478 --> 00:24:07,344
Well, just tell me.
I won't tell anyone.

552
00:24:09,315 --> 00:24:10,459
If one of your kids had to die,

553
00:24:10,483 --> 00:24:13,567
which one would
you choose and why?

554
00:24:13,635 --> 00:24:15,668
Well, Bailey because
he kept me up all night.

555
00:24:15,737 --> 00:24:17,470
But ask me tomorrow,
it might be Zola.

556
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:19,974
Why? What's going on?

557
00:24:20,042 --> 00:24:22,275
I have two newborns
who need a liver transplant

558
00:24:22,344 --> 00:24:24,178
and one liver. Oh.

559
00:24:24,246 --> 00:24:27,709
The other one won't
survive until tomorrow.

560
00:24:27,733 --> 00:24:29,667
Well, you have
to run all the tests.

561
00:24:29,735 --> 00:24:31,368
Yeah, every test is a tie.

562
00:24:31,437 --> 00:24:33,314
There's no medical
question anymore, Mer.

563
00:24:33,338 --> 00:24:35,522
They're just kids now,

564
00:24:35,591 --> 00:24:39,426
and I got to decide whether
the boy lives or the girl lives.

565
00:24:39,495 --> 00:24:42,412
I mean, Alex, you really
have to trust your instincts.

566
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:43,947
I don't know, Mer.

567
00:24:44,016 --> 00:24:46,516
If I was one of these
kids, with my family,

568
00:24:46,585 --> 00:24:48,745
where I came from, I
wouldn't have bet on me.

569
00:24:50,272 --> 00:24:51,967
I would have looked
in my crystal ball

570
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:55,993
and seen a druggie
or a burnout or...

571
00:24:56,062 --> 00:24:58,389
I would not have seen me as
the guy who makes the decisions.

572
00:24:58,413 --> 00:25:00,853
I would not have
seen that coming.

573
00:25:02,351 --> 00:25:05,235
I mean, what if one of
them becomes a serial killer,

574
00:25:05,304 --> 00:25:08,755
the other one's gonna
cure Alzheimer's?

575
00:25:08,824 --> 00:25:11,174
That's not your problem.

576
00:25:11,243 --> 00:25:13,243
I mean, it's just like
raising your own kids.

577
00:25:13,312 --> 00:25:15,546
They're gonna be who they are.

578
00:25:15,615 --> 00:25:18,365
We just have to try to give
them the best shot we can.

579
00:25:19,969 --> 00:25:21,919
Hey. Hey.

580
00:25:21,988 --> 00:25:24,800
The twins' lungs are filling
with fluid. You're out of time.

581
00:25:24,824 --> 00:25:26,823
Screw it. I'm not
making this call.

582
00:25:26,893 --> 00:25:28,102
If there's a decision to be made

583
00:25:28,126 --> 00:25:29,638
about withdrawing
care from an infant,

584
00:25:29,662 --> 00:25:31,973
Bailey can do it, she's the
chief. She can do it, not me.

585
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:34,632
No, no, hey, no, no,
Alex. What are you doing?

586
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,845
I have been watching you,
I have been in awe of you

587
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:39,013
stepping up for these
babies, for these parents

588
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:40,277
in a way that...

589
00:25:41,473 --> 00:25:43,418
Do you remember the
first time we ever talked?

590
00:25:43,442 --> 00:25:44,741
Really talked.

591
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:46,688
We were on a plane, and we just

592
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:49,113
picked up a transplant
organ from a kid who died,

593
00:25:49,181 --> 00:25:53,133
and you were upset and pissy
because you thought that I didn't care.

594
00:25:53,202 --> 00:25:55,753
But I thought... Wow.

595
00:25:57,523 --> 00:26:00,024
"This guy could do it.

596
00:26:00,092 --> 00:26:02,743
"He cares enough
about this work.

597
00:26:03,946 --> 00:26:05,746
"This guy has it."

598
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:08,515
And I knew that day, Alex.

599
00:26:08,583 --> 00:26:10,316
And today...

600
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:18,425
I have been so proud of you.

601
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:22,958
And so now you
can't hand it over

602
00:26:22,982 --> 00:26:25,176
to somebody else
because they're yours,

603
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,911
and they need you,
and you can do it.

604
00:26:26,935 --> 00:26:28,846
And you have to because
if you give it to Bailey,

605
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:31,016
you won't be able to look at
yourself in the mirror, I promise you.

606
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:34,440
You'll always wonder what
kind of doctor you could be.

607
00:26:35,061 --> 00:26:38,428
This is the job, Alex.

608
00:26:38,497 --> 00:26:42,057
And it's why you get
paid the big bucks.

609
00:26:46,355 --> 00:26:50,690
Mason, this is Dr. Bailey, I've
asked her to perform your operation.

610
00:26:50,759 --> 00:26:52,743
To remove the lobe of
your liver for donation.

611
00:26:52,812 --> 00:26:54,494
And who will get it?

612
00:26:56,999 --> 00:26:59,750
Well, the test and the
scans were inconclusive.

613
00:26:59,818 --> 00:27:01,479
I need to open up both babies.

614
00:27:01,503 --> 00:27:03,987
I need to see both
tumors up close.

615
00:27:04,056 --> 00:27:05,723
And then I'll decide.

616
00:27:06,542 --> 00:27:08,291
You have to?

617
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,911
In order to make the best
choice, the right choice,

618
00:27:10,979 --> 00:27:12,546
or we risk losing them both.

619
00:27:13,816 --> 00:27:14,936
And we're racing the clock,

620
00:27:15,001 --> 00:27:17,241
so I need to take them now.

621
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:20,320
Wait, wait! They
don't have names.

622
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:22,606
We're not letting them
go before we name them.

623
00:27:29,831 --> 00:27:31,465
She looks like an Emma.

624
00:27:31,534 --> 00:27:33,214
She does.

625
00:27:33,635 --> 00:27:34,901
Hi, Emma.

626
00:27:40,575 --> 00:27:42,095
Daniel. Daniel.

627
00:27:42,745 --> 00:27:43,865
Emma and Daniel.

628
00:27:52,621 --> 00:27:53,965
What do you have
against kids anyway?

629
00:27:53,989 --> 00:27:55,222
God, nothing.

630
00:27:56,024 --> 00:27:57,424
Okay, I don't hate kids.

631
00:28:00,146 --> 00:28:02,312
It's not the kids,
it's the parents.

632
00:28:02,381 --> 00:28:03,714
All right?

633
00:28:07,285 --> 00:28:09,770
I was an EMT right
out of high school.

634
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:11,505
I loved it.

635
00:28:11,574 --> 00:28:13,273
It's why I went to med school.

636
00:28:14,576 --> 00:28:18,195
My second call out, it's an MVC.

637
00:28:18,264 --> 00:28:21,698
A woman's in the front seat
bleeding from a neck lac.

638
00:28:21,767 --> 00:28:24,168
And she's holding her
little toddler, who is DOA.

639
00:28:25,738 --> 00:28:27,938
She wouldn't let him go.

640
00:28:28,007 --> 00:28:30,152
And I'm trying to
stop her from bleeding,

641
00:28:30,176 --> 00:28:31,675
but she just held on.

642
00:28:32,277 --> 00:28:33,610
And cried.

643
00:28:34,479 --> 00:28:36,346
And the sound she made...

644
00:28:38,217 --> 00:28:41,734
I thought, she's gonna cry
like this for the rest of her life.

645
00:28:43,855 --> 00:28:47,240
So, I decided right
there, no peds for me.

646
00:28:48,544 --> 00:28:51,745
And not because of the kids.

647
00:28:51,814 --> 00:28:55,482
I don't want that
responsibility over a parent.

648
00:28:55,551 --> 00:28:58,452
And, yeah, maybe that
makes me a lousy doctor,

649
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:01,321
or maybe I'm just
not strong enough.

650
00:29:02,057 --> 00:29:03,323
But...

651
00:29:03,392 --> 00:29:05,992
I get to decide what
I'm best suited for.

652
00:29:06,478 --> 00:29:07,844
Right?

653
00:29:07,913 --> 00:29:09,124
I mean, don't I get to decide

654
00:29:09,148 --> 00:29:11,388
what kind of doctor
I'm gonna be?

655
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:14,767
Yeah, you do.

656
00:29:16,105 --> 00:29:17,521
You have to.

657
00:29:28,367 --> 00:29:29,900
Fifteen blade, please.

658
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:38,842
Scalpel.

659
00:29:42,181 --> 00:29:43,914
And 10 blade.

660
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,359
Push bovine to
30. More lap pads.

661
00:29:56,428 --> 00:29:57,889
That's what I needed to see.

662
00:29:57,913 --> 00:29:59,673
All right, hold on, don't move.

663
00:30:01,016 --> 00:30:03,250
I need a little more retraction.

664
00:30:03,318 --> 00:30:05,535
Good. Hold right there.

665
00:30:07,372 --> 00:30:08,399
Do you see where she's got...

666
00:30:08,423 --> 00:30:09,439
Wait, yeah.

667
00:30:12,327 --> 00:30:13,810
Yeah.

668
00:30:15,246 --> 00:30:17,126
What do you think? Okay.

669
00:30:19,417 --> 00:30:21,651
It's Emma. The
liver's going to Emma.

670
00:30:22,787 --> 00:30:25,027
All right, there you go.

671
00:30:26,642 --> 00:30:29,108
But I need you to do
the transplant for me.

672
00:30:29,177 --> 00:30:31,077
I want to try a primary
resection on Daniel

673
00:30:31,146 --> 00:30:32,823
and see if I can save
the liver he already has.

674
00:30:32,847 --> 00:30:34,258
At least buy him more time...
- Alex.

675
00:30:34,282 --> 00:30:35,402
I want to save them both.

676
00:30:35,451 --> 00:30:37,028
But can the child
even withstand?

677
00:30:37,052 --> 00:30:38,880
Probably not. I mean,
he's de-sating on me,

678
00:30:38,904 --> 00:30:40,848
and I've already maxed
out meds, but I swear,

679
00:30:40,872 --> 00:30:42,639
if I don't try, he'll
be dead by tonight.

680
00:30:42,708 --> 00:30:44,241
I want to try.

681
00:30:45,711 --> 00:30:46,977
<i>Suction.</i>

682
00:30:47,713 --> 00:30:49,513
<i>Retract here.</i>

683
00:30:55,521 --> 00:30:57,582
Hey, Karev's
throwing a Hail Mary.

684
00:30:57,606 --> 00:30:58,839
<i>Suction.</i>

685
00:31:00,041 --> 00:31:02,087
Why you furrowing
your brow at me?

686
00:31:02,111 --> 00:31:04,677
I would think that
you, of all people,

687
00:31:04,746 --> 00:31:07,046
this hospital's first
female chief of surgery,

688
00:31:07,116 --> 00:31:08,631
would fight for a
woman to get paid

689
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,500
at least as much as any man.

690
00:31:10,569 --> 00:31:11,968
This is about Meredith Grey.

691
00:31:12,037 --> 00:31:13,648
I mean, if you do not value
her enough, then just...

692
00:31:13,672 --> 00:31:15,316
It is inappropriate
for me to discuss

693
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:16,718
the salary of another employee.

694
00:31:16,742 --> 00:31:18,086
She deserves more,
and you know it.

695
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:20,410
I do, and don't
ever suggest to me

696
00:31:20,478 --> 00:31:22,007
that I do not
stand in sisterhood

697
00:31:22,031 --> 00:31:24,312
with the other
women in this hospital.

698
00:31:24,366 --> 00:31:28,234
You've never been
4'11" tall and overlooked

699
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:30,181
and called "girl" by
your male colleagues.

700
00:31:30,205 --> 00:31:33,890
You don't know. I am
woman. Hear me roar.

701
00:31:33,959 --> 00:31:35,970
But I've already mentored Grey.

702
00:31:35,994 --> 00:31:38,829
I've already taught her
what she needs to know.

703
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:41,076
And now that I'm
chief of this hospital,

704
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:43,211
it's not my fault
if she's not used

705
00:31:43,235 --> 00:31:45,346
the skills that I taught her.

706
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:48,149
And it's not my job to be giving
away money when it's not asked for.

707
00:31:48,173 --> 00:31:50,673
You have coddled her.

708
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:55,061
Yes, since Derek, you have
coddled her, and I won't do that.

709
00:31:55,129 --> 00:31:57,230
No, she needs to rise.

710
00:31:57,298 --> 00:31:59,093
And she needs to rise on her own

711
00:31:59,117 --> 00:32:01,801
so she knows she
can rise on her own.

712
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:03,736
Because...

713
00:32:03,805 --> 00:32:06,973
You may not be here
the next time she falls.

714
00:32:07,993 --> 00:32:10,233
She needs to fight for herself.

715
00:32:13,515 --> 00:32:14,614
Okay.

716
00:32:15,651 --> 00:32:19,219
This is what a
feminist looks like, sir.

717
00:32:20,922 --> 00:32:22,500
Oh, how's the little girl?

718
00:32:22,524 --> 00:32:24,691
Good. She's back in the NICU.

719
00:32:24,759 --> 00:32:27,138
Perfect anastomosis, and her
kidneys have already bounced back.

720
00:32:27,162 --> 00:32:28,461
But how's he doing?

721
00:32:31,466 --> 00:32:33,110
That's a good
resection margin, right?

722
00:32:33,134 --> 00:32:34,668
Yeah. I see you got most of it.

723
00:32:34,737 --> 00:32:37,103
It's decent, it's
just really close...

724
00:32:37,172 --> 00:32:39,673
All right, I just need
to get this last...

725
00:32:41,093 --> 00:32:42,258
Suction.

726
00:32:42,327 --> 00:32:44,728
Suction. Hepatic
vein's leaking. Clamp.

727
00:32:47,366 --> 00:32:48,865
Another clamp.

728
00:32:53,756 --> 00:32:55,922
No, no, come on.

729
00:32:57,292 --> 00:32:59,203
Was it a bad call
trying to resect?

730
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:00,304
No. No.

731
00:33:00,328 --> 00:33:03,730
It was the right
call, just a bold one.

732
00:33:03,799 --> 00:33:06,377
You know, this would have
happened during his transplant surgery.

733
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:07,700
Mmm-hmm.

734
00:33:07,769 --> 00:33:09,786
Karev chose the right twin.

735
00:33:09,855 --> 00:33:11,087
Another clamp.

736
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:20,875
You did it? You did it.

737
00:33:22,201 --> 00:33:24,262
What? ALEX: Damn
it, he's arresting.

738
00:33:24,286 --> 00:33:27,070
Push .02 of epi and
another 50cc of blood.

739
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:31,458
Come on, buddy. Come on.

740
00:33:31,526 --> 00:33:33,271
BP's dropping,
persistent bradycardia.

741
00:33:33,295 --> 00:33:35,578
Try it .08 to the ET tube.

742
00:33:35,647 --> 00:33:36,729
Come on, we're losing him.

743
00:33:36,798 --> 00:33:38,365
But you had him.

744
00:33:39,167 --> 00:33:41,287
He won't get him back.

745
00:33:41,836 --> 00:33:43,186
No, he won't.

746
00:33:52,664 --> 00:33:54,480
I'm gonna close, stapler.

747
00:33:54,549 --> 00:33:56,115
But you've got a rhythm.

748
00:33:56,184 --> 00:33:58,001
Those are agonal
beats, they won't last.

749
00:33:58,069 --> 00:34:00,297
So, what do we do?
Just push more epi, right?

750
00:34:00,321 --> 00:34:02,388
He's maxed out on
epi. His heart's too weak.

751
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:04,869
No, you can't just
stop, okay? What else?

752
00:34:04,893 --> 00:34:05,992
There's nothing else.

753
00:34:15,971 --> 00:34:17,971
Nothing to do but wait.

754
00:34:19,741 --> 00:34:21,908
Oh, Alex.

755
00:35:56,304 --> 00:35:58,921
You have a beautiful baby girl.

756
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,923
The transplant went very well,

757
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:03,342
she's now recovering
very, very smoothly.

758
00:36:10,718 --> 00:36:14,087
Laurie, we did everything
we could to save the boy.

759
00:36:15,056 --> 00:36:16,739
No.

760
00:36:16,808 --> 00:36:19,225
Despite our best efforts,
the tumor was too strong...

761
00:36:20,862 --> 00:36:22,345
I'm so sorry.

762
00:36:43,151 --> 00:36:44,751
<i>Dr. Cohen, NICU.</i>

763
00:36:50,292 --> 00:36:52,742
What is it, Grey?

764
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:54,922
We need to talk
about my contract.

765
00:36:54,946 --> 00:36:56,245
Mmm-hmm.

766
00:37:00,168 --> 00:37:03,169
You said I deserved to
be your chief of general.

767
00:37:03,238 --> 00:37:04,971
That I made your job easier.

768
00:37:06,108 --> 00:37:08,391
I was happy, I was grateful.

769
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:11,010
That doesn't change the
fact that I earned this job,

770
00:37:11,078 --> 00:37:13,579
and I worked very hard for it.

771
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:15,793
I need to feel as valued
as you say you value me.

772
00:37:15,817 --> 00:37:18,301
I need to be able
to look in the mirror.

773
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:20,019
This is just not enough.

774
00:37:20,088 --> 00:37:21,688
Do you have a number in mind?

775
00:37:24,092 --> 00:37:25,358
Yes.

776
00:37:38,373 --> 00:37:40,873
I can make that
happen. Is that all, Grey?

777
00:37:42,143 --> 00:37:44,143
Yep. That's it.

778
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:47,146
Okay, thanks.

779
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:50,433
Grey? Yeah?

780
00:37:51,236 --> 00:37:52,618
Well done.

781
00:38:01,996 --> 00:38:03,346
Dr. Karev.

782
00:38:04,849 --> 00:38:06,633
You pooped? I pooped.

783
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:11,370
Let's get you out of here. Yes.

784
00:38:26,237 --> 00:38:30,005
Thank you for not
changing the locks.

785
00:38:31,927 --> 00:38:34,794
Things got a little
crazy last night.

786
00:38:34,863 --> 00:38:38,263
Maybe you're right. Maybe
I'm being a little crazy.

787
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:41,801
But is it really crazy?

788
00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:44,232
To try like hell to save
the one thing in the world

789
00:38:44,256 --> 00:38:46,556
that matters most to you?

790
00:38:46,625 --> 00:38:49,508
I love you, and
if fighting for...

791
00:38:53,615 --> 00:38:56,599
<i>When you're faced
with the tough choices,</i>

792
00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:58,267
<i>it comes down to you.</i>

793
00:39:15,103 --> 00:39:16,936
<i>What can you live with?</i>

794
00:39:23,578 --> 00:39:25,945
<i>What can you leave behind?</i>

795
00:39:26,014 --> 00:39:29,549
Towels are in the bathroom.
Anything else you need?

796
00:39:29,618 --> 00:39:31,917
No, no, no. I'm fine,
thank you. Okay.

797
00:39:34,055 --> 00:39:35,266
It's only for one night.

798
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:37,490
He shouldn't have to
sleep in a hotel, it's...

799
00:39:43,514 --> 00:39:45,474
- Two more, please.
- You got it.

800
00:39:46,785 --> 00:39:48,184
Here you go.

801
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:53,356
Dr. Pierce, um, I'm off shift.

802
00:39:53,424 --> 00:39:55,669
Just having a quick
one before I head home.

803
00:39:55,693 --> 00:39:57,877
It's fine, I have no home.

804
00:39:58,613 --> 00:40:00,245
That planet exploded.

805
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:10,801
You know, I don't hate kids.

806
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:12,903
I just... BARTENDER:
Another round?

807
00:40:12,927 --> 00:40:14,360
Hate it when they die.

808
00:40:14,428 --> 00:40:16,830
Hey, we have that in
common. Here you go.

809
00:40:26,457 --> 00:40:27,835
Hey, can I ask you something?

810
00:40:27,859 --> 00:40:28,859
Hmm?

811
00:40:30,178 --> 00:40:32,562
Do you ever wonder
why people should trust us

812
00:40:32,631 --> 00:40:34,196
to just decide, like,

813
00:40:34,266 --> 00:40:37,267
the most important
questions of their lives?

814
00:40:37,335 --> 00:40:39,596
I mean, you're just a
person just like them, right?

815
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:41,855
But suddenly, you're
given this incredible

816
00:40:41,923 --> 00:40:43,634
responsibility to just...

817
00:40:43,658 --> 00:40:45,791
You have really pretty eyes.

818
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:48,243
Uh... Thank you.

819
00:40:59,374 --> 00:41:02,008
<i>Right or wrong,
you have to decide.</i>

820
00:41:05,847 --> 00:41:08,297
<i>What you're willing
to go down fighting for.</i>

821
00:41:08,366 --> 00:41:09,606
You okay?

822
00:41:10,802 --> 00:41:11,968
Yeah.

823
00:41:13,037 --> 00:41:14,303
Look, about last night...

824
00:41:14,372 --> 00:41:17,139
No, you said it's none
of my business, so...

825
00:41:17,208 --> 00:41:19,875
Well, it's not and it is.

826
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:24,213
Look, I get mad,
and you get squirrely.

827
00:41:24,281 --> 00:41:25,348
I do not...

828
00:41:25,416 --> 00:41:27,016
No, you get squirrely
when someone says

829
00:41:27,085 --> 00:41:29,363
they're gonna be there, and
then you think maybe they won't.

830
00:41:29,387 --> 00:41:31,103
That happens. You're allowed.

831
00:41:33,441 --> 00:41:34,858
Okay.

832
00:41:34,926 --> 00:41:36,459
I'm not going anywhere.

833
00:41:37,028 --> 00:41:38,677
And if...

834
00:41:40,181 --> 00:41:42,648
Having a kid is what
you want, then...

835
00:41:44,252 --> 00:41:46,052
I can be ready.

836
00:41:47,906 --> 00:41:51,057
I'm ready, let's do it.

837
00:41:54,162 --> 00:41:56,946
Let's make a baby, right now.

838
00:41:57,015 --> 00:42:00,583
Are you out of your mind?

839
00:42:00,652 --> 00:42:02,134
We're not having a baby.

840
00:42:02,203 --> 00:42:04,398
I'm in the middle
of a residency.

841
00:42:04,422 --> 00:42:07,022
You are never home.
And what about us?

842
00:42:07,091 --> 00:42:08,741
We haven't even traveled.

843
00:42:08,810 --> 00:42:11,121
And what happened to
the dog? Let's get a dog.

844
00:42:11,145 --> 00:42:12,929
No, do not come near me.

845
00:42:12,997 --> 00:42:14,831
We are not making a baby.

846
00:42:14,899 --> 00:42:16,298
No.

847
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:18,234
Mmm. Woof.

848
00:42:18,302 --> 00:42:19,782
<i>The choice is yours.</i>
