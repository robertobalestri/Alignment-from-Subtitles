1
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:04,736
<i>"Don't be scared."</i>

2
00:00:04,805 --> 00:00:07,572
<i>I have no idea how
many times I've said it.</i>

3
00:00:07,641 --> 00:00:12,777
<i>The intern stands over a patient
with a scalpel or a needle or a clamp,</i>

4
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:15,314
<i>afraid to make the first move.</i>

5
00:00:15,383 --> 00:00:16,981
Told you it wasn't that far.

6
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:20,118
Curb, front door. What's
that, 50 feet? It's not that bad.

7
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:21,427
It's a nice 50 feet.

8
00:00:21,455 --> 00:00:22,987
Mmm-hmm.

9
00:00:23,056 --> 00:00:25,101
So help me out.
Which date was this?

10
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:26,508
Why?

11
00:00:26,576 --> 00:00:28,455
Well, I need to know
what to put in my diary.

12
00:00:30,514 --> 00:00:32,459
Well, there was one, and
then there was another,

13
00:00:32,483 --> 00:00:34,066
so I'm pretty sure
that makes two.

14
00:00:34,134 --> 00:00:36,212
And what about the car
ride home the other night?

15
00:00:36,236 --> 00:00:37,780
I could barely
keep my eyes open.

16
00:00:37,804 --> 00:00:41,723
Well, we ate. We talked. We
laughed. It was very date-like.

17
00:00:42,827 --> 00:00:43,925
Why does it matter?

18
00:00:45,279 --> 00:00:46,761
Three's my lucky number.

19
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:48,129
<i>They're scared.</i>

20
00:00:48,198 --> 00:00:52,567
Well, then I guess
you're out of luck.

21
00:00:52,636 --> 00:00:53,702
Mmm.

22
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:59,424
<i>They know what to do.</i>

23
00:00:59,493 --> 00:01:01,533
<i>But they just need
that little push.</i>

24
00:01:01,929 --> 00:01:03,011
Wait.

25
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:08,150
You didn't say good night.

26
00:01:08,218 --> 00:01:10,285
Oh. How thoughtless...

27
00:01:12,339 --> 00:01:13,583
Of me.

28
00:01:17,094 --> 00:01:18,593
Good night.

29
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:19,694
Good night.

30
00:01:41,484 --> 00:01:42,829
Just hang in there,
okay? Yes, sir.

31
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:44,052
Thanks.

32
00:02:04,724 --> 00:02:06,824
I have to go to sleep. Aw.

33
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:07,909
Early rounds.

34
00:02:07,978 --> 00:02:09,878
I know. I know.

35
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:12,848
Good night. Good night.

36
00:02:14,735 --> 00:02:16,017
I love you.

37
00:02:19,189 --> 00:02:20,221
Thank you.

38
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:33,213
What, are you
sneaking out on me?

39
00:02:33,237 --> 00:02:34,603
Oh, hey.

40
00:02:34,671 --> 00:02:35,671
Sorry.

41
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:38,924
Give me a minute. We
can get some coffee.

42
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,391
Actually, I can't.

43
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,611
I'm assisting Bailey on
that Heller myotomy today.

44
00:02:42,696 --> 00:02:44,774
Oh. That's right. That's today.

45
00:02:44,798 --> 00:02:47,382
Well, text me right after. I
want to know all about it.

46
00:02:47,451 --> 00:02:49,211
Okay. Okay. Hello?

47
00:02:50,487 --> 00:02:52,154
Oh.

48
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:05,450
Get out! Get out! Go!

49
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:06,752
Get out! Just get out!

50
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:09,070
Please, just get out!
What is going on?

51
00:03:09,139 --> 00:03:10,834
I don't know. She
just started screaming.

52
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:12,619
Why are you here?
Why is she screaming?

53
00:03:12,643 --> 00:03:14,487
Get him out of here!
What did you do?

54
00:03:14,511 --> 00:03:16,094
Nothing! God, no, nothing!

55
00:03:16,163 --> 00:03:18,074
We were sleeping. I was
sleeping, and then the screaming. I...

56
00:03:18,098 --> 00:03:19,798
Mer? Mer, are you okay?

57
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:20,965
What's happening?

58
00:03:21,035 --> 00:03:22,511
Get him out of here. Who's he?

59
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:24,530
Look, just for the record,
I didn't do anything.

60
00:03:24,554 --> 00:03:25,765
Get him out of here!

61
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:26,966
My shoes are in there.

62
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:28,106
Get out!

63
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:36,381
Mer? Mer, he's gone.

64
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:37,916
Can you please open the door?

65
00:03:37,985 --> 00:03:40,266
I am worried about you. I
want to know that you're okay.

66
00:03:41,838 --> 00:03:43,071
Is he gone?

67
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,357
Yeah. Yeah, he's gone.

68
00:03:56,753 --> 00:03:58,531
Move the VP shunt till Monday.

69
00:03:58,555 --> 00:04:00,839
Got it. Anything else?

70
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:02,985
All right, I'll be in touch.

71
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:04,209
Shepherd not coming in today?

72
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,321
No.

73
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:06,978
Is she sick or...

74
00:04:07,047 --> 00:04:10,293
I don't know. Uh,
I'll tell her you asked.

75
00:04:10,317 --> 00:04:11,550
Yes. Thank you. That's...

76
00:04:12,136 --> 00:04:13,502
Okay.

77
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:14,870
Ashley Hughes, 21.

78
00:04:14,938 --> 00:04:17,333
Crush injuries with
bilateral hip dislocation.

79
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:18,373
Good distal pulses.

80
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,358
How'd it happen? Fell on me.

81
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:23,228
What? What fell on you? I did.

82
00:04:23,297 --> 00:04:25,047
Whoa. Uh, you okay there?

83
00:04:25,115 --> 00:04:26,759
You're bleeding pretty
bad from that head lac.

84
00:04:26,783 --> 00:04:28,694
Don't worry about me.
Just make sure she's okay.

85
00:04:28,718 --> 00:04:30,798
Let's get her inside.
Somebody page Torres.

86
00:04:32,455 --> 00:04:33,550
So the Rotko kid
looks pretty good,

87
00:04:33,574 --> 00:04:34,684
but I want to monitor
him overnight.

88
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:36,086
You said we should do something.

89
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:37,487
We are. We're monitoring
the kid overnight.

90
00:04:37,511 --> 00:04:40,345
About April. It was your idea.

91
00:04:40,414 --> 00:04:42,192
"Something." I
said, "Something."

92
00:04:42,216 --> 00:04:44,256
I didn't say, "Go behind
her back and tell Jackson."

93
00:04:46,253 --> 00:04:47,330
April.

94
00:04:47,354 --> 00:04:49,404
Hi. Uh, good morning.

95
00:04:49,473 --> 00:04:51,289
Um, we're gonna
take the next one.

96
00:04:52,442 --> 00:04:54,042
Oh.

97
00:04:54,111 --> 00:04:55,193
Okay.

98
00:04:58,265 --> 00:05:00,832
Yeah, well, maybe next
time be a little more specific.

99
00:05:10,494 --> 00:05:12,994
You know how long it's
been since I saw your mother?

100
00:05:13,764 --> 00:05:14,980
No idea, sir.

101
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:16,982
Too long.

102
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:19,751
Her plane lands any minute.

103
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,064
Yeah, I'm sure that trip's a
complete coincidence, right?

104
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:25,523
Nothing to do with me
or her or, I don't know,

105
00:05:25,592 --> 00:05:27,642
anything you might
have mentioned.

106
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:32,096
Um, my wife and I don't have
any secrets between us, Jackson.

107
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:36,518
I enjoy seeing her, and
she enjoys seeing you.

108
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:39,888
Now, if you feel otherwise,

109
00:05:40,891 --> 00:05:41,957
that's a damn shame.

110
00:05:46,313 --> 00:05:49,209
Your injuries are not that bad,
but Ashley's are pretty severe.

111
00:05:49,233 --> 00:05:51,673
Can you walk us through
exactly what happened?

112
00:05:52,368 --> 00:05:54,869
I don't really think that's...

113
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:58,506
I mean, you know,
Ashley, she's a lady.

114
00:05:58,575 --> 00:06:01,775
Mmm-hmm. And you
and the lady were...

115
00:06:02,679 --> 00:06:04,874
Listen, it is easier for
us to treat her properly

116
00:06:04,898 --> 00:06:08,332
if we know how the
injuries happened.

117
00:06:08,402 --> 00:06:10,018
I don't want to kiss and tell.

118
00:06:12,773 --> 00:06:16,207
He's funny, cute, and sweet,
and so I thought, "What if he's big?"

119
00:06:16,276 --> 00:06:17,854
I'm an athlete.

120
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:20,172
I ran the New York City Marathon
the fastest of anyone in my age group,

121
00:06:20,196 --> 00:06:21,841
and I don't back
down from a challenge.

122
00:06:21,865 --> 00:06:23,226
Maybe you should've
backed down from this one.

123
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:24,460
Hey, you shouldn't
say things like that.

124
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:26,985
People make assumptions
based on size all the time.

125
00:06:27,054 --> 00:06:30,133
I mean, so, what, I just shouldn't
date big people just because I'm little?

126
00:06:30,157 --> 00:06:31,951
I really like him.
He's a gentleman.

127
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:33,774
She asked me over to her place.

128
00:06:34,844 --> 00:06:36,093
I was sort of surprised.

129
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:39,192
I mean, obviously, the size
difference crossed my mind,

130
00:06:39,216 --> 00:06:40,932
but I am not a quitter.

131
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,063
I was staring at Mount Everest,
and I was ready to climb.

132
00:06:44,087 --> 00:06:46,805
I'm sorry. I'm not really
comfortable talking about this.

133
00:06:46,857 --> 00:06:48,534
So my legs were
on his shoulders.

134
00:06:48,558 --> 00:06:50,108
It was a lovely evening.

135
00:06:50,176 --> 00:06:52,360
And my feet were,
like, way up in the air,

136
00:06:52,446 --> 00:06:55,730
and it took some finessing
at first, but I was determined,

137
00:06:55,799 --> 00:06:57,009
and it was worth it.

138
00:06:57,033 --> 00:07:00,452
Oh, my God, it was
so worth it, until...

139
00:07:00,504 --> 00:07:02,553
I slipped. Boom!

140
00:07:02,623 --> 00:07:04,973
Then her legs snapped.

141
00:07:07,811 --> 00:07:09,410
It was terrible.

142
00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:10,556
It was terrible!

143
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:11,963
Ooh!

144
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:14,249
But this is way worse.

145
00:07:14,317 --> 00:07:16,017
Okay, her pain's
still not controlled.

146
00:07:16,086 --> 00:07:18,498
Well, she's maxed out on meds.
We'll have to reduce her under general.

147
00:07:18,522 --> 00:07:20,266
Uh, no, but then we'd
have to intubate her.

148
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:23,024
Uh, Warren! Warren, I
need your help in here.

149
00:07:23,093 --> 00:07:27,062
Okay, Ashley, I know that you
are really hurting, and I can help that

150
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:32,784
if you think that you can handle a
lot of pain right now all at once, okay?

151
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:35,331
We need to get your legs back into
your sockets, the sooner the better.

152
00:07:35,355 --> 00:07:37,750
Now, we can go to the
operating room, or we can...

153
00:07:37,774 --> 00:07:39,719
Might as well get it over with.

154
00:07:39,743 --> 00:07:40,841
It's your call.

155
00:07:41,778 --> 00:07:44,018
Go big or go home, right?

156
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:45,864
All right.

157
00:07:45,933 --> 00:07:48,261
Edwards, you do the left
leg. I'll do the right. Can you...

158
00:07:48,285 --> 00:07:49,495
We're gonna do
them both at once?

159
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:52,003
No need to put her
through this twice.

160
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:54,391
All right, Warren, I'm gonna
need you to hold her in place.

161
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:57,308
All right. Hang in there.

162
00:07:57,377 --> 00:07:59,544
Almost there. Oh, God!
Oh, God! Oh, God! No!

163
00:07:59,613 --> 00:08:01,007
All right, is everyone
ready? Yep.

164
00:08:01,031 --> 00:08:02,825
Ready. All right, on
the count of three.

165
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:05,416
One, two, three!

166
00:08:08,121 --> 00:08:09,866
She can't stay locked
away up there all day.

167
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:11,400
She has to come down sometime.

168
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:13,435
Do you think she wants food
or just coffee, or not coffee?

169
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:15,437
What if she wants tea?
Tea is more soothing.

170
00:08:15,461 --> 00:08:17,239
What do we know about this
guy? I mean, not very much.

171
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:20,463
I mean, she's barely
even dating him. It's... Hi.

172
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,546
How are you?

173
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:25,930
Um, we made coffee,
but we could make tea.

174
00:08:27,106 --> 00:08:28,540
Are you okay?

175
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:30,302
Where do we keep the
stuff for the countertops?

176
00:08:30,326 --> 00:08:32,188
What? The blue
stuff, you know, the...

177
00:08:32,212 --> 00:08:34,145
To clean the countertops
that's safe for kids.

178
00:08:34,214 --> 00:08:36,381
Uh. Used to be behind
the paper towels.

179
00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:39,562
Uh, Meredith, what happened?

180
00:08:39,586 --> 00:08:40,952
How can we help you?

181
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:42,320
I found it.

182
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:45,639
Meredith.

183
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:48,076
You are wondering why I'm here.

184
00:08:48,144 --> 00:08:50,395
I crashed here last night.

185
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:52,663
And the night
before. On the couch.

186
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:54,260
I thought I'd be out
before you woke up, but...

187
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:55,804
Can I use this on the stovetop?

188
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:57,196
Sure.

189
00:08:58,488 --> 00:09:00,822
Thing is probably covered
in 10 years of grease.

190
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,308
Uh...

191
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:04,737
I'm sorry I didn't ask before.

192
00:09:04,761 --> 00:09:06,772
I just needed a place
to stay for a minute,

193
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:08,975
but I'm gonna grab my
stuff, and I'm gonna go now.

194
00:09:08,999 --> 00:09:10,560
No, it's Owen. Something
happened with Owen,

195
00:09:10,584 --> 00:09:11,978
and it really
shook her up, so...

196
00:09:12,002 --> 00:09:13,082
Maggie!

197
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:14,735
Look, you told me and...

198
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:17,339
Yeah, and now I wish I hadn't.

199
00:09:17,407 --> 00:09:19,807
I'm leaving. No, please stay!

200
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,176
Something happened to you,

201
00:09:22,245 --> 00:09:23,956
and now something has
happened to Meredith,

202
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,325
and I think that we
should all just sit down

203
00:09:26,349 --> 00:09:28,582
and talk about it, all right?

204
00:09:29,836 --> 00:09:31,036
Can I use bleach in here?

205
00:09:34,641 --> 00:09:36,202
There's something
we use under the sink.

206
00:09:36,226 --> 00:09:37,258
I can show you.

207
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:42,480
Yeah.

208
00:09:49,456 --> 00:09:52,056
We're taking Ashley up to CT
now. Torres would like you to join.

209
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:53,405
I'll be there in a few minutes.

210
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:56,527
I almost killed her.

211
00:09:58,331 --> 00:09:59,598
With our sex.

212
00:10:02,202 --> 00:10:03,668
Dr. Blake, I need some help.

213
00:10:03,737 --> 00:10:05,003
I paged Dr. Torres,

214
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:07,505
but she just ran a trauma
patient up to CT and...

215
00:10:07,574 --> 00:10:09,855
Okay, let me see what you got.

216
00:10:10,811 --> 00:10:12,176
Oh, God.

217
00:10:12,245 --> 00:10:15,179
Uh. Yes, Dr. Torres or
did you try Dr. Robbins?

218
00:10:15,248 --> 00:10:17,482
Dr. Robbins is in surgery.

219
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:20,118
So I figured since you
and Dr. Torres are...

220
00:10:20,187 --> 00:10:22,187
Oh. Right. Okay.

221
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:24,549
I've got it.

222
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:28,738
Hi. She was having a
play date with my daughter,

223
00:10:28,762 --> 00:10:31,757
and they were running around,
and she tripped. Landed on a rock.

224
00:10:31,781 --> 00:10:34,348
I brought her right
in. She's okay, right?

225
00:10:35,768 --> 00:10:38,686
Hi, sweetie. I am Dr. Blake.

226
00:10:38,755 --> 00:10:40,755
I'm Sofia Sloan-Torres.

227
00:10:40,824 --> 00:10:43,825
I know. I work with your mom.

228
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:44,893
Your moms.

229
00:10:45,495 --> 00:10:46,561
My head hurts.

230
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:49,764
Okay. Let's take
a look at that cut.

231
00:10:52,635 --> 00:10:55,970
Okay. That doesn't
look bad at all.

232
00:10:57,758 --> 00:11:02,460
It is so cold and sleeting
back east, just dreadful!

233
00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:04,240
So you came to
Seattle for some sun?

234
00:11:04,264 --> 00:11:07,165
I came to Seattle
for my son. Mmm.

235
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:08,867
How are things going with April?

236
00:11:08,935 --> 00:11:10,913
Why must you
meddle in everything?

237
00:11:10,937 --> 00:11:13,772
I do believe you went
through an entire divorce

238
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,107
without me saying one word.

239
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:17,876
Oh, Jackson, I just
want to talk to her.

240
00:11:17,944 --> 00:11:19,310
No, absolutely not.

241
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:21,046
Oh. Come on, honey, let me help.

242
00:11:21,114 --> 00:11:24,132
You won't help, though, Mom.
You'll only make things worse.

243
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,700
Now, I cannot be any
clearer with you about this.

244
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,002
No.

245
00:11:28,071 --> 00:11:29,381
I don't want you
talking to April.

246
00:11:29,405 --> 00:11:30,883
I don't want you
bullying her around.

247
00:11:30,907 --> 00:11:32,785
I don't want you anywhere
near it, actually, okay?

248
00:11:32,809 --> 00:11:35,743
It's my problem, my
business, none of yours.

249
00:11:36,712 --> 00:11:37,762
Understood?

250
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,491
Zola and Bailey are dropped off.

251
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,093
Is Ellis still down?

252
00:11:52,162 --> 00:11:53,402
Sound asleep.

253
00:11:56,349 --> 00:11:58,699
And we are cleaning in here now.

254
00:11:58,768 --> 00:12:01,853
We are done in the kitchen,
so we have moved on.

255
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:04,322
Okay.

256
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:07,091
Well, pass the disinfectant.

257
00:12:09,262 --> 00:12:11,813
DeLuca got out of here
in a hurry this morning.

258
00:12:11,882 --> 00:12:14,093
Yeah, he's scrubbing
in on a Heller myotomy.

259
00:12:14,117 --> 00:12:16,277
He's doing the
esophageal dissection.

260
00:12:17,637 --> 00:12:19,036
Where's the wood polish?

261
00:12:19,106 --> 00:12:20,788
Here you go.

262
00:12:20,856 --> 00:12:25,193
I told him to let me know how it
goes, so I'm just waiting for a text.

263
00:12:25,262 --> 00:12:28,830
Owen won't stop
texting and calling.

264
00:12:29,983 --> 00:12:31,316
What are you gonna do?

265
00:12:32,702 --> 00:12:33,984
I have no idea.

266
00:12:35,288 --> 00:12:36,916
Yeah, I wouldn't
know what to do, either.

267
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:40,986
You know Owen probably
better than any of us.

268
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,370
Do you have any
advice for Amelia?

269
00:12:46,716 --> 00:12:48,266
How long has that
stain been there?

270
00:12:56,158 --> 00:12:59,126
You're keeping
busy. I am hiding.

271
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:03,398
Catherine Avery is here, apparently,
and I am not in the mood for...

272
00:13:04,901 --> 00:13:07,702
In the ER, I'm a sitting
duck, but in an OR...

273
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:09,404
Come on, she can't be that bad.

274
00:13:09,472 --> 00:13:13,458
No, she's worse than bad. She
can be terrifying, like a hurricane.

275
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:15,972
When she hits, you do
not want to be in her wake.

276
00:13:15,996 --> 00:13:17,528
Well, you can't
avoid her forever,

277
00:13:17,597 --> 00:13:20,281
not when she's about to
become Hurricane Granny.

278
00:13:21,618 --> 00:13:25,420
Maybe not, but I
can avoid her for now.

279
00:13:26,756 --> 00:13:29,236
You ready? My first
surgery's with you.

280
00:13:31,026 --> 00:13:32,955
She has a femoral neck
fracture on the right hip.

281
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:35,379
It didn't show up
on the plain films.

282
00:13:35,448 --> 00:13:38,082
Yeah, I met a puppy once
that was half German Shepherd,

283
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:39,817
half Teacup Chihuahua,

284
00:13:39,886 --> 00:13:43,454
and all I could think
was, how did you happen?

285
00:13:43,522 --> 00:13:46,824
I once watched this monster truck
crush this two-seater convertible

286
00:13:46,893 --> 00:13:49,510
at an intersection, and the
truck barely had a scratch on it,

287
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:51,340
but the convertible was totaled.

288
00:13:51,364 --> 00:13:53,664
I mean, logistically, if
the Chihuahua is the dad,

289
00:13:53,733 --> 00:13:56,083
did he just hop up on the
German Shepherd mom?

290
00:13:56,152 --> 00:13:58,719
Ashley was just
out for a joy ride

291
00:13:58,788 --> 00:14:01,388
with her top down,
and then... Bam.

292
00:14:01,457 --> 00:14:02,673
Head-on collision.

293
00:14:02,742 --> 00:14:04,270
Or is the German
Shepherd the dad,

294
00:14:04,294 --> 00:14:06,288
and they give a ladder to
the little Chihuahua mom

295
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:07,606
so that he can reach her?

296
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:08,757
Whoa! Whoa, whoa.
Stop, stop, stop!

297
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:10,409
No, these are
scientific questions.

298
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:11,682
No, not you. The scanner.

299
00:14:15,138 --> 00:14:16,404
Look at her right leg.

300
00:14:17,907 --> 00:14:19,240
It's pale and cold.

301
00:14:19,309 --> 00:14:20,703
No distal pulse. We
need a gurney in here!

302
00:14:20,727 --> 00:14:22,304
Book an OR. Right away.

303
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:23,489
What... What's happening?

304
00:14:23,513 --> 00:14:24,957
Ashley, I stopped the scan

305
00:14:24,981 --> 00:14:26,741
because I saw
something concerning.

306
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:28,511
The blood flow to your
right leg is compromised.

307
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:30,802
It's not good, so just
hang in there, Ashley.

308
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:34,405
All right, come on over. On the
count of three. One, two, three!

309
00:14:34,473 --> 00:14:35,473
Let's move.

310
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:40,812
Looks like the
leg is pinking up.

311
00:14:40,881 --> 00:14:42,947
Oh, caught it just in time.

312
00:14:43,016 --> 00:14:44,582
You know, gosh, it sounds fun,

313
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:48,369
but you do not want to run into
a German Shepherd in the wild.

314
00:14:48,438 --> 00:14:49,587
Happened to me in college.

315
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:51,655
Uh, irrigation?

316
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,202
I don't think this conversation
is entirely appropriate.

317
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:55,438
No, it's not. K-wire, continue.

318
00:14:55,462 --> 00:14:57,156
Yeah, I was at a
party, met a guy,

319
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:00,882
took him home, and
when his pants came off,

320
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:03,868
my jaw hit the
floor and so did it.

321
00:15:03,936 --> 00:15:06,220
Oh. That is not okay.

322
00:15:06,289 --> 00:15:07,889
That is what I said. I said,

323
00:15:07,957 --> 00:15:09,418
"Get out of here, and you
take that thing with you."

324
00:15:09,442 --> 00:15:10,786
How big could it have been?

325
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:12,293
Okay, can we not?

326
00:15:12,361 --> 00:15:13,601
Yeah.

327
00:15:14,397 --> 00:15:15,479
Oh, wow.

328
00:15:16,766 --> 00:15:18,611
- No, no, no.
- That's... Yeah.

329
00:15:18,635 --> 00:15:20,184
Dr. Torres? Yeah.

330
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:21,880
It's not urgent, but
they're calling from the ER.

331
00:15:21,904 --> 00:15:23,632
Your daughter's down
there with a head lac.

332
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:25,167
What? I can take over. You go.

333
00:15:25,191 --> 00:15:26,324
Yeah.

334
00:15:34,167 --> 00:15:36,183
When I was pregnant
with Jackson,

335
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:38,836
a three-hour
surgery felt like 12.

336
00:15:38,905 --> 00:15:40,872
Hi, Catherine. Um...

337
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,785
I actually don't
really have much time

338
00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:44,053
'cause I have another
surgery really soon...

339
00:15:44,077 --> 00:15:45,476
Oh. Baby, please, sit back down.

340
00:15:45,545 --> 00:15:47,878
Come on. I know
you're tired. It's okay.

341
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:49,090
Come on.

342
00:15:50,165 --> 00:15:51,799
Some nights, my
feet were so swollen,

343
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:55,836
I was physically unable to
even take my sneakers off.

344
00:15:55,905 --> 00:15:58,284
A few times, I slept
in the damn things.

345
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:02,493
I... I guess you
talked to Jackson.

346
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:05,479
Oh. Let's not talk about him.

347
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:09,000
I want to know about you.

348
00:16:09,069 --> 00:16:11,035
How many weeks is it now?

349
00:16:11,104 --> 00:16:12,536
Uh...

350
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:14,405
It's okay.

351
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:16,101
We don't have to talk
about it if you don't want to.

352
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:18,492
I... I understand. I'll go.

353
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:21,646
Thirteen.

354
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:25,966
I'm coming up on 13.

355
00:16:26,035 --> 00:16:28,485
Morning sickness?

356
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:32,657
Um, no, I've actually been
really lucky with that so far.

357
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:36,694
You are lucky. I
couldn't stop being sick.

358
00:16:36,763 --> 00:16:39,207
I thought I was coming down
with the stomach flu or something.

359
00:16:39,231 --> 00:16:42,645
Took a whole week for me
to realize I was having a baby.

360
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:44,896
It was a shock.

361
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,622
Yes, uh, it's
definitely startling.

362
00:16:49,525 --> 00:16:51,992
Yeah, the morning that
the test turned positive,

363
00:16:52,061 --> 00:16:54,901
I couldn't believe I had to turn
around and keep it together that day.

364
00:16:56,266 --> 00:16:57,331
I bet.

365
00:16:58,801 --> 00:17:02,937
I was already so emotional,

366
00:17:03,005 --> 00:17:05,906
but I was not gonna cry
in that lawyer's office, so...

367
00:17:06,476 --> 00:17:08,009
Oh, honey.

368
00:17:08,077 --> 00:17:12,246
You mean, you found out the same
day you signed the divorce papers?

369
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:17,919
Yeah, it was a rough day.

370
00:17:17,987 --> 00:17:19,954
I just sat there listening
to those lawyers,

371
00:17:20,023 --> 00:17:22,422
but all I could think
about was how I just...

372
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:27,478
I just... I needed
time to, like, think.

373
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:30,414
Mmm. Process.

374
00:17:30,483 --> 00:17:33,016
I would've done the
exact same thing.

375
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:41,992
Sweetheart, no
matter what happens...

376
00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:43,827
Everything looks good here.

377
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:46,816
All right, let's hope that we don't
come back to the ER for a while, okay?

378
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:50,951
Thank you for taking
such good care of her.

379
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:53,354
See you in a bit, okay?

380
00:17:57,927 --> 00:18:00,661
You okay? Okay? Of course.

381
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:04,042
And, uh, Sofia is okay,
which is what really matters.

382
00:18:04,066 --> 00:18:06,200
Okay.

383
00:18:06,268 --> 00:18:09,564
I mean, it would've been nice to get
a page, um, before you treated her.

384
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:10,866
Well, I just wanted to make sure

385
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:12,518
I had all the information
before I pulled you out.

386
00:18:12,542 --> 00:18:15,142
No, right, of course. Or
you could've tried Karev.

387
00:18:15,211 --> 00:18:17,845
He's in peds, or Grey, who
Sofia's grown up knowing.

388
00:18:17,914 --> 00:18:19,758
Grey has the day
off, and Karev just left.

389
00:18:19,782 --> 00:18:21,515
Or Bailey.

390
00:18:21,584 --> 00:18:23,762
You want me to page the
Chief of Surgery for a head lac.

391
00:18:23,786 --> 00:18:25,026
Mmm-hmm.

392
00:18:26,422 --> 00:18:29,039
What's going on?

393
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:33,611
She's my kid, and she doesn't
know anything about you.

394
00:18:35,248 --> 00:18:37,688
We haven't even
had that conversation.

395
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:38,999
Oh.

396
00:18:39,068 --> 00:18:40,748
So... Okay.

397
00:18:42,171 --> 00:18:44,889
This is about what I
said last night, isn't it?

398
00:18:46,442 --> 00:18:49,843
The last thing that I wanted
to do is make things weird.

399
00:18:49,912 --> 00:18:51,924
It's Arizona. She's
glad that you helped.

400
00:18:51,948 --> 00:18:53,976
Obviously, she's not mad,
but she's not ready, either.

401
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,335
You and I, it's all happening
so fast, and we're so new and...

402
00:18:57,403 --> 00:18:59,203
Oh, God. No, that's...

403
00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:01,283
What was I thinking?
It's fine. It's fine.

404
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:03,852
Your heart was in the right
place, and she'll be ready one day.

405
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:05,676
Okay, absolutely.

406
00:19:07,997 --> 00:19:09,296
I'm sorry.

407
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:11,649
I can wait.

408
00:19:18,207 --> 00:19:20,357
What vacuum cleaner
is this complicated?

409
00:19:20,426 --> 00:19:21,792
It's a carpet steamer.

410
00:19:21,861 --> 00:19:22,910
And we own it?

411
00:19:23,413 --> 00:19:24,611
Assembly.

412
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:27,200
"Insert handle into machine
base. Press down firmly."

413
00:19:29,068 --> 00:19:30,308
Okay. Bolts.

414
00:19:32,321 --> 00:19:33,561
And circle thingy.

415
00:19:34,407 --> 00:19:35,527
What happened with Owen?

416
00:19:37,226 --> 00:19:38,492
It's nothing.

417
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,121
Uh. Little circles
or big circles?

418
00:19:40,145 --> 00:19:43,147
Small. You're
lying. Screwdriver.

419
00:19:43,216 --> 00:19:47,118
I showed up at his trailer.
He was drunk, so I left.

420
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,503
Hose. How drunk?

421
00:19:49,572 --> 00:19:52,406
Bad. Slurring, stumbling.

422
00:19:52,475 --> 00:19:55,142
He's tried to call.
I'm not ready.

423
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:57,661
Where is he?

424
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:59,764
I'll kill him. Did he
hurt you? Are you hurt?

425
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:03,450
Go fill this with water. Cold.

426
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:04,702
What's going on?

427
00:20:06,606 --> 00:20:08,851
There's a stain on the carpet.

428
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:10,302
You said this was an emergency.

429
00:20:10,326 --> 00:20:11,436
There is. There's a stain.

430
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,910
I canceled my last two surgeries

431
00:20:12,978 --> 00:20:14,773
and left DeLuca in charge
of my post-ops for this?

432
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:16,875
He's out already? The Heller
myotomy, that was today.

433
00:20:16,899 --> 00:20:17,948
That got canceled.

434
00:20:19,302 --> 00:20:22,036
Okay, I'll do it myself.
Somebody vacuum the stain.

435
00:20:24,957 --> 00:20:26,406
Don't look at me.

436
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,040
Dr. Robbins? Huh?

437
00:20:32,765 --> 00:20:35,031
I'm so sorry. You
are Sofia's mother.

438
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,413
I never would've
interacted with her

439
00:20:37,437 --> 00:20:39,481
if I knew that you would
have a problem with it.

440
00:20:39,505 --> 00:20:41,439
What? What did you do?

441
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:44,809
I... Callie explained to me

442
00:20:44,877 --> 00:20:47,344
that you weren't comfortable
with me meeting Sofia.

443
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:49,697
You're not ready, and
I totally understand.

444
00:20:49,766 --> 00:20:52,616
No, wait, stop. Just...
No, I never said that.

445
00:20:52,684 --> 00:20:55,013
Well, however you
phrased it, it's fine.

446
00:20:55,037 --> 00:20:56,515
I just wanted to apologize...

447
00:20:56,539 --> 00:20:58,789
No! The subject
has never come up.

448
00:20:58,858 --> 00:21:00,758
She was lying.

449
00:21:06,415 --> 00:21:08,749
Callie lied to me about you?

450
00:21:10,303 --> 00:21:11,469
It sure seems like that.

451
00:21:19,512 --> 00:21:21,406
So DeLuca probably
just got busy, right?

452
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:22,780
I mean, he's an intern.

453
00:21:22,849 --> 00:21:24,343
He's probably just been
running around all day.

454
00:21:24,367 --> 00:21:26,595
He just forgot to tell me
his surgery was canceled.

455
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:28,463
You sure that thing
works? It's brand-new!

456
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:30,732
Just because you never took it
out of the box doesn't mean it works.

457
00:21:30,756 --> 00:21:32,017
How long has it been
sitting in the closet?

458
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:33,674
Are we facing
this the right way?

459
00:21:33,743 --> 00:21:36,287
The steam is facing the carpet.
How many other ways are there?

460
00:21:36,311 --> 00:21:37,939
It's been like this
lately, you know?

461
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:39,775
It's been hard for us to get
our schedules to match up.

462
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:42,061
It's funny. It was easier
for us to get together

463
00:21:42,085 --> 00:21:44,485
before we went public than now.

464
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:45,698
So funny.

465
00:21:49,726 --> 00:21:51,425
What?

466
00:21:51,493 --> 00:21:53,939
Why are you all exchanging
looks and not exchanging words?

467
00:21:53,963 --> 00:21:56,463
He's been a little
standoffish and hard to reach

468
00:21:56,532 --> 00:22:00,267
and not entirely upfront
about everything he's doing.

469
00:22:00,335 --> 00:22:02,735
A little, I guess.
What are you saying?

470
00:22:03,088 --> 00:22:05,171
He's giving you the brush-off.

471
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:08,058
Uh, no. No, he's not
giving me anything.

472
00:22:08,127 --> 00:22:09,292
That's the problem.

473
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:12,579
Give me that!

474
00:22:12,648 --> 00:22:15,132
You think he's dumping
me? That's ridiculous!

475
00:22:15,934 --> 00:22:17,083
Unless it isn't.

476
00:22:20,606 --> 00:22:21,984
Where are you
going? To the hospital.

477
00:22:22,008 --> 00:22:25,692
No one brushes me off.
I brush. I'm the brusher.

478
00:22:25,762 --> 00:22:27,495
No, no, no. This is a bad idea.

479
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,041
Mer, you want to jump in here?

480
00:22:30,666 --> 00:22:32,666
This stain is not coming out.

481
00:22:39,208 --> 00:22:40,323
Hey.

482
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:41,719
Whatever's going on
between you and Penny,

483
00:22:41,743 --> 00:22:42,804
leave me out of it.

484
00:22:42,828 --> 00:22:44,127
Okay. She does not waste time.

485
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:46,897
Um. Look, I said a thing...

486
00:22:46,965 --> 00:22:48,911
I know! I know what you said.

487
00:22:48,935 --> 00:22:51,279
So listen, I mean, we've never
even discussed Penny meeting Sofia,

488
00:22:51,303 --> 00:22:52,764
which I'm fine with, by the way,

489
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:54,555
but then you go and
throw me under the bus?

490
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:56,768
I don't even... I know. I
know. I wasn't thinking.

491
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:59,593
I... I was just... I blurted
it out, and it was so dumb.

492
00:22:59,662 --> 00:23:03,246
Great, so if you have a problem
with your girlfriend, figure it out.

493
00:23:03,315 --> 00:23:05,260
Don't put me in the middle of it

494
00:23:05,284 --> 00:23:08,444
because I'm... I'm done being
stuck in the middle of things.

495
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:18,212
Hey. Is that Amelia or...

496
00:23:18,281 --> 00:23:21,182
Look, I promise I gave
her your message, Dr. Hunt.

497
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:23,562
I... I promise. It's
just, this is my mom.

498
00:23:23,586 --> 00:23:24,668
Okay.

499
00:23:26,222 --> 00:23:27,554
What'd you do?

500
00:23:27,622 --> 00:23:28,739
Excuse me?

501
00:23:28,808 --> 00:23:30,619
Look, I know that look.

502
00:23:30,643 --> 00:23:32,588
I get that look whenever
I piss off Miranda.

503
00:23:32,612 --> 00:23:35,178
She ignores my messages, too,
and we live in the same house.

504
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:38,682
I think this is a
little worse than that.

505
00:23:39,985 --> 00:23:42,886
I, uh, bought Tuck
a pocket knife.

506
00:23:42,955 --> 00:23:46,315
He liked camping, wanted to
whittle, and the thing was beautiful.

507
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:47,886
It was wooden
handle, steel blade.

508
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:52,413
It was really nice, but
she didn't see it that way.

509
00:23:52,481 --> 00:23:54,648
What I saw as a survival tool

510
00:23:54,717 --> 00:23:57,400
she saw as an inappropriately
dangerous weapon.

511
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:59,503
Huh. And she forgave you?

512
00:23:59,572 --> 00:24:01,849
Yeah, eventually,
but, uh, you know,

513
00:24:01,873 --> 00:24:03,251
still comes up
from time to time,

514
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:04,591
but, you know, it faded.

515
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:07,711
Well, I thought this was
gonna fade, but hasn't yet.

516
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:11,649
I mean, it took
some apologizing.

517
00:24:11,717 --> 00:24:15,152
A lot of apologizing. Yeah.

518
00:24:15,221 --> 00:24:18,322
Look, I just I told her I would never
intentionally do anything to hurt him

519
00:24:19,308 --> 00:24:20,674
or her.

520
00:24:20,743 --> 00:24:23,722
You know, and she knows
that because she knows me,

521
00:24:23,746 --> 00:24:27,081
but, um, sometimes you...

522
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:30,250
You just have to say it.

523
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:37,391
So I freak her out by
telling her I love her,

524
00:24:37,459 --> 00:24:40,327
and she lies to my
face. Who does that?

525
00:24:40,396 --> 00:24:41,439
She didn't say it back?

526
00:24:41,463 --> 00:24:42,729
Not even close.

527
00:24:42,798 --> 00:24:46,499
Ugh. I did that to Alex.

528
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:50,237
She'll say it back, right?
I mean, you said it back.

529
00:24:50,306 --> 00:24:53,440
Yeah! A few years later.

530
00:24:54,109 --> 00:24:55,742
A few years?

531
00:24:55,811 --> 00:24:58,345
I can't live like
this for a few years.

532
00:24:59,681 --> 00:25:00,876
You don't really have a choice.

533
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:03,501
When you date an attending,
they have all the power.

534
00:25:03,569 --> 00:25:05,413
You're an intern at home.
You're an intern at work.

535
00:25:05,437 --> 00:25:07,449
There's no way around
it. No one asked you!

536
00:25:07,473 --> 00:25:08,555
And she's a resident.

537
00:25:09,524 --> 00:25:11,608
DeLuca, a word?

538
00:25:11,677 --> 00:25:12,960
Yeah, of course.

539
00:25:17,899 --> 00:25:20,912
He has a point, though. Pierce
definitely has all the power.

540
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:22,469
I have to talk to Callie.

541
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,107
You're avoiding me.

542
00:25:27,176 --> 00:25:28,775
What? No, I haven't.

543
00:25:28,844 --> 00:25:31,328
I've called. You
haven't answered.

544
00:25:31,397 --> 00:25:33,208
Just been a really
busy day. Sure.

545
00:25:33,232 --> 00:25:35,298
In a marathon surgery
that got canceled.

546
00:25:36,018 --> 00:25:37,767
Um...

547
00:25:37,836 --> 00:25:39,620
What's really going on here?

548
00:25:39,688 --> 00:25:40,754
Uh...

549
00:25:42,008 --> 00:25:43,374
Okay, look, I'm very busy.

550
00:25:43,442 --> 00:25:45,676
I have many, many
things on my plate.

551
00:25:45,745 --> 00:25:48,512
I just... I don't have
time or patience

552
00:25:48,581 --> 00:25:50,730
to play childish guessing games.

553
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,599
Do you want to
be with me or not?

554
00:25:56,688 --> 00:25:57,821
There's my answer.

555
00:25:59,792 --> 00:26:01,391
Look, it's not like...

556
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:04,327
You know, you're the one
who wanted this out in the open,

557
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:06,675
and now that we've done
that for, what, like five minutes,

558
00:26:06,699 --> 00:26:08,131
you can't handle it?

559
00:26:09,001 --> 00:26:10,144
I'm sorry.

560
00:26:10,168 --> 00:26:11,408
You can leave now.

561
00:26:22,364 --> 00:26:24,131
Mer, that closet's
cleaned already.

562
00:26:24,199 --> 00:26:27,412
Well, we're gonna use the top shelf
for beach towels, towels, and rags.

563
00:26:27,436 --> 00:26:29,280
The middle shelf
will be for sheets,

564
00:26:29,304 --> 00:26:31,249
and the bottom shelf
will be for the children

565
00:26:31,273 --> 00:26:32,667
in case they need to reach it.

566
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:34,024
Okay. Sure.

567
00:26:34,093 --> 00:26:38,194
I counted 19 mini-shampoos
and 11 conditioners.

568
00:26:39,531 --> 00:26:41,197
Trash or...

569
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:43,233
I'll take them. What?

570
00:26:43,302 --> 00:26:45,419
Works the same as
shampoo in a big bottle.

571
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:57,330
Mer, what is it?

572
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,533
It's his stupid, stupid blanket.

573
00:27:02,872 --> 00:27:04,071
We're done cleaning.

574
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,411
Run me through what
happened. She coded.

575
00:27:16,435 --> 00:27:18,102
It was a massive
pulmonary embolism.

576
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:20,037
They're doing a cath
embolectomy right now.

577
00:27:20,105 --> 00:27:21,337
This is my fault.

578
00:27:21,406 --> 00:27:23,774
I reduced both of her
hips in the trauma room.

579
00:27:23,842 --> 00:27:26,488
I should've waited. It's been
problem after problem ever since.

580
00:27:26,512 --> 00:27:28,990
This is a known complication of
femur fractures. You know that.

581
00:27:29,014 --> 00:27:30,491
I shouldn't have
pushed. If I had just...

582
00:27:30,515 --> 00:27:32,449
Torres. Torres, stop.

583
00:27:32,518 --> 00:27:33,928
You did what you had
to do. You made a call.

584
00:27:33,952 --> 00:27:35,046
The wrong one, apparently.

585
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,070
A bold one.

586
00:27:36,138 --> 00:27:37,821
We don't know
that it caused this.

587
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:40,519
I know you feel responsible, but
there's no place for that right now.

588
00:27:40,543 --> 00:27:43,177
I need to deal with this
clot before she arrests again.

589
00:27:43,245 --> 00:27:44,678
Plate.

590
00:27:44,747 --> 00:27:46,787
Here you go. - Thank you.

591
00:27:48,684 --> 00:27:50,550
Hey.

592
00:27:50,619 --> 00:27:53,865
Um, I just had the most unexpected
conversation with your mother.

593
00:27:53,889 --> 00:27:55,922
Damn it! I told her not
to say anything. Just...

594
00:27:55,991 --> 00:27:59,926
No, no, no. It was fine. Um.
It was really nice, actually.

595
00:27:59,995 --> 00:28:03,730
Maybe we could find a time to talk
sometime soon, just the two of us?

596
00:28:07,869 --> 00:28:08,902
I'd like that.

597
00:28:09,805 --> 00:28:10,845
Great.

598
00:28:18,613 --> 00:28:20,693
Oh, God, she's dead, isn't she?

599
00:28:20,883 --> 00:28:22,349
Ashley's okay.

600
00:28:22,434 --> 00:28:24,101
She suffered a
severe complication,

601
00:28:24,169 --> 00:28:26,302
but we were able
to control it in time,

602
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:28,571
and she should
make a full recovery.

603
00:28:32,294 --> 00:28:33,911
Whoa, uh...

604
00:28:33,979 --> 00:28:35,924
I'm sorry. I didn't
hurt you, did I?

605
00:28:35,948 --> 00:28:37,597
No. It's fine. I'm fine.

606
00:28:39,034 --> 00:28:40,274
She'll be awake soon?

607
00:28:40,318 --> 00:28:42,519
Yeah, we'll send someone
to come and get you.

608
00:28:42,588 --> 00:28:44,032
Okay. See you.

609
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:45,936
You okay? Yeah, I think so.

610
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:49,470
She's at Meredith Grey's house.

611
00:28:49,494 --> 00:28:51,094
She is?

612
00:28:51,163 --> 00:28:53,508
She asked me to send
over some case files,

613
00:28:53,532 --> 00:28:55,109
and so that is where she will be

614
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:58,212
in case, you know, you
wanted to make a bold move.

615
00:29:05,844 --> 00:29:07,488
Here you go, Sofia's chart.

616
00:29:07,512 --> 00:29:08,857
All clear. Thank you.

617
00:29:08,881 --> 00:29:11,159
And don't worry. I didn't
discharge her myself.

618
00:29:11,183 --> 00:29:12,360
I had Bailey do it.

619
00:29:12,384 --> 00:29:14,228
Chief says she's good.
She must be good.

620
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:16,753
Look, Penny, I'm sorry. I
should not have lied to you.

621
00:29:16,822 --> 00:29:18,567
If we are not in the same place,

622
00:29:18,591 --> 00:29:21,603
if you aren't ready to be
where I am, that is fine.

623
00:29:21,627 --> 00:29:24,005
You can tell me,
and I will listen.

624
00:29:24,029 --> 00:29:26,796
If you aren't ready for
me to meet Sofia, great.

625
00:29:26,865 --> 00:29:28,432
That is your decision.

626
00:29:28,501 --> 00:29:32,021
But making me feel like crap
about trying to help, lying to me,

627
00:29:32,438 --> 00:29:33,770
that is not okay.

628
00:29:39,228 --> 00:29:42,929
So Amelia went to go pick up
the kids. Should be back soon.

629
00:29:43,682 --> 00:29:45,349
Whoa.

630
00:29:45,417 --> 00:29:46,783
You made a fire.

631
00:29:46,852 --> 00:29:49,353
I mean, it's 70 degrees
outside, but that's cool.

632
00:29:55,026 --> 00:29:57,186
This was Derek's blanket.

633
00:29:57,996 --> 00:29:59,474
I always hated the
stupid thing. It's...

634
00:29:59,498 --> 00:30:02,999
It's not soft. It's not
warm. It's not a great color.

635
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:07,110
He had it in the trailer.
He brought it here.

636
00:30:07,172 --> 00:30:09,412
Made it to the
dream house with us.

637
00:30:12,344 --> 00:30:15,712
He made a bed in front of
this fireplace for us once.

638
00:30:23,322 --> 00:30:27,241
<i>And now he's gone, and I
still have the damn thing.</i>

639
00:30:31,297 --> 00:30:33,697
I freaked out this morning.

640
00:30:33,766 --> 00:30:35,866
I heard. You okay?

641
00:30:37,636 --> 00:30:42,005
So you brought the guy
here, and it was terrible.

642
00:30:45,177 --> 00:30:46,976
It wasn't terrible.

643
00:30:49,714 --> 00:30:50,881
So why did you freak out?

644
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:53,150
That's the problem. It
was kind of incredible.

645
00:30:56,138 --> 00:31:00,039
He was going to leave,
and then we fell asleep,

646
00:31:00,875 --> 00:31:02,375
and then when we woke up,

647
00:31:04,446 --> 00:31:08,181
I... He was just
there, and I just...

648
00:31:13,438 --> 00:31:15,939
Everyone said I was ready.

649
00:31:16,008 --> 00:31:17,624
You said I would be okay,

650
00:31:17,692 --> 00:31:20,972
so I thought I should just
do it and get it over with.

651
00:31:21,213 --> 00:31:23,446
But I wasn't ready for it

652
00:31:27,052 --> 00:31:28,352
to be...

653
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,200
You warm enough?

654
00:31:43,402 --> 00:31:44,642
Yeah, I'm fine.

655
00:31:53,712 --> 00:31:56,846
Remember, guys, Mama
made the house really clean,

656
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:59,075
and we're gonna
keep it that way, okay?

657
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:01,284
Oh, someone's here.

658
00:32:01,352 --> 00:32:02,592
Hey.

659
00:32:05,157 --> 00:32:08,358
Uh. Okay, Zo, you take your
brother inside and wash your hands.

660
00:32:08,427 --> 00:32:11,128
Okay. Come on, Bailey. Let's go.

661
00:32:14,516 --> 00:32:15,516
Hey.

662
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:20,587
I just wanted to see you

663
00:32:20,656 --> 00:32:25,291
so I could apologize,
you know, face-to-face.

664
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:29,712
About the other night, I
am sorry. I was thoughtless.

665
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:33,549
And I don't know why...

666
00:32:36,221 --> 00:32:38,588
I don't have an excuse.

667
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:42,216
Amelia, Riggs said some
things to me, and it just...

668
00:32:42,294 --> 00:32:43,393
And...

669
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:46,696
And I'm really sorry.

670
00:32:48,233 --> 00:32:49,299
I know.

671
00:32:50,402 --> 00:32:51,568
I knew.

672
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:57,640
Listen, I just got sober again,

673
00:32:59,378 --> 00:33:01,311
so to find myself
in that position...

674
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:03,174
And it was unfair of
me to put you there.

675
00:33:03,198 --> 00:33:07,133
I know that, and it
will not happen again.

676
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:10,070
No, I know it won't.

677
00:33:10,138 --> 00:33:11,471
I promise.

678
00:33:13,542 --> 00:33:15,208
I appreciate that,

679
00:33:16,478 --> 00:33:18,545
but I can't count on it.

680
00:33:18,613 --> 00:33:21,848
Right now, I have
to count on myself.

681
00:33:21,917 --> 00:33:26,803
It's not your fault. You're
just not in this with me,

682
00:33:30,142 --> 00:33:32,342
so I can't do this with
you, not right now.

683
00:33:34,713 --> 00:33:35,796
Maybe not at all.

684
00:33:37,499 --> 00:33:38,960
Amelia, you know
me. I would never...

685
00:33:38,984 --> 00:33:41,485
I know that right now
I'd like you to leave.

686
00:33:45,156 --> 00:33:46,256
Okay.

687
00:34:01,189 --> 00:34:03,751
Oh. Your numbers look great.

688
00:34:03,775 --> 00:34:04,974
Thanks.

689
00:34:06,778 --> 00:34:09,679
They, uh, said
you're, uh, awake.

690
00:34:11,616 --> 00:34:12,632
Hi.

691
00:34:14,002 --> 00:34:15,869
Um...

692
00:34:15,937 --> 00:34:18,016
I think he might want to
come in. You all right with that?

693
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,089
Yeah.

694
00:34:23,362 --> 00:34:26,962
Ash, I, uh, don't
know what to say.

695
00:34:27,749 --> 00:34:29,148
Uh...

696
00:34:29,217 --> 00:34:31,618
They said I'll be okay.

697
00:34:34,273 --> 00:34:35,513
I'm so glad.

698
00:34:41,897 --> 00:34:44,764
Listen, Chris, I've
been to the mountaintop,

699
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:49,469
and it's exhilarating, but I...

700
00:34:49,538 --> 00:34:52,989
But you don't ever want
to see me again, do you?

701
00:34:54,642 --> 00:34:56,927
No one needs to
climb Everest twice.

702
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,269
Oh, hey.

703
00:35:06,338 --> 00:35:09,155
Uh, Sofia's more than okay...

704
00:35:09,224 --> 00:35:11,390
thanks to some
astronaut stickers

705
00:35:11,459 --> 00:35:13,710
and some strawberry
Jell-O. Thank you.

706
00:35:13,779 --> 00:35:16,557
When did you know that Little
Tuck was ready to meet Ben?

707
00:35:16,581 --> 00:35:18,914
Oh. Um...

708
00:35:18,983 --> 00:35:22,202
Well, Tuck was too
young to tie his own shoes,

709
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:24,554
so I wasn't gonna get
any answers from him.

710
00:35:24,623 --> 00:35:28,225
What I cared about
was, was I ready?

711
00:35:30,496 --> 00:35:32,596
Hmm?

712
00:35:32,664 --> 00:35:34,642
See, I'm ready. I was
ready the day I met her,

713
00:35:34,666 --> 00:35:38,451
but I'm always ready too
early. I got married too early. I...

714
00:35:40,121 --> 00:35:42,583
It was one thing when it
was about me, but now...

715
00:35:42,607 --> 00:35:45,308
You know, say...

716
00:35:45,377 --> 00:35:48,645
Okay, when you see Sofia
kick a ball across the room

717
00:35:48,713 --> 00:35:51,581
and you start to daydream
about 20 years from now

718
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:55,635
when Sofia scores winning goal
at the Women's World Cup Final

719
00:35:55,703 --> 00:35:59,139
and the whole stadium
is chanting her name.

720
00:35:59,207 --> 00:36:00,790
"Torres! Torres!"

721
00:36:00,859 --> 00:36:02,270
And it's all in slow motion

722
00:36:02,294 --> 00:36:04,660
and you're up in the
stands screaming and crying.

723
00:36:04,729 --> 00:36:06,889
Yes, yes. You do that, too?

724
00:36:07,749 --> 00:36:10,316
So the question is,

725
00:36:10,384 --> 00:36:15,554
who do you want screaming
and cheering beside you?

726
00:36:22,464 --> 00:36:24,630
This looks cozy.
What are we doing?

727
00:36:24,699 --> 00:36:28,059
Enjoying the clean, clean
house. Look at your crumbs.

728
00:36:29,037 --> 00:36:30,520
How's DeLuca?

729
00:36:30,588 --> 00:36:32,889
He's a non-issue now.

730
00:36:34,676 --> 00:36:36,042
How's Hunt?

731
00:36:38,146 --> 00:36:39,962
Also a non-issue.

732
00:36:42,801 --> 00:36:43,961
What am I eating?

733
00:36:44,002 --> 00:36:46,130
I'm gonna need something
way less healthy than this.

734
00:36:46,154 --> 00:36:47,498
- Pizza's coming.
- Mmm.

735
00:36:47,522 --> 00:36:49,242
Mmm.

736
00:36:51,242 --> 00:36:52,392
You're not pizza.

737
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,594
Uh. No, I'm not. I'm...

738
00:36:54,663 --> 00:36:55,973
Is Meredith home? I'm Will.

739
00:36:55,997 --> 00:36:57,675
I know who you are.
Yeah, you should leave.

740
00:36:57,699 --> 00:36:59,193
Look, I've been worried
about her all day. She...

741
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:00,316
No, really, go.

742
00:37:00,385 --> 00:37:01,718
It's okay. I got it.

743
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:04,654
Hi.

744
00:37:11,329 --> 00:37:13,195
Who's that?

745
00:37:13,265 --> 00:37:14,980
That's the doctor
who fixed my head!

746
00:37:15,049 --> 00:37:18,667
Yes, she is, and she
is a very special doctor.

747
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:19,819
You remember her name?

748
00:37:21,139 --> 00:37:23,123
Penny. Her name is Penny.

749
00:37:23,191 --> 00:37:24,307
Hi, Penny!

750
00:37:24,376 --> 00:37:26,337
Hi, Sofia. How's your head?

751
00:37:26,361 --> 00:37:27,960
Good!

752
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:30,864
We decided that stitches could
only be made better with ice cream.

753
00:37:30,932 --> 00:37:34,567
And I thought maybe you
might want to come with us?

754
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:41,841
We are in the same place.
I'm in the same place as you.

755
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:44,010
I've been there
a while. I just...

756
00:37:46,298 --> 00:37:48,715
I would like for you to
come get ice cream with us.

757
00:37:49,317 --> 00:37:50,549
Very much.

758
00:37:52,537 --> 00:37:55,188
And you can say no.
I would understand.

759
00:37:55,257 --> 00:37:56,622
I'm not saying no.

760
00:37:58,410 --> 00:37:59,890
Then what are you saying?

761
00:38:02,147 --> 00:38:03,147
Thank you.

762
00:38:05,333 --> 00:38:07,200
All right. I think we're
going. You ready?

763
00:38:07,886 --> 00:38:08,918
All right, let's go.

764
00:38:11,489 --> 00:38:12,788
All right!

765
00:38:27,605 --> 00:38:30,651
Hey, Jackson, your mother and I
are headed to dinner. Care to join?

766
00:38:30,675 --> 00:38:33,042
You know what? I
can't. Thanks, though.

767
00:38:33,111 --> 00:38:34,551
Ma, can I talk to
you for a second?

768
00:38:34,963 --> 00:38:36,296
Mmm.

769
00:38:36,364 --> 00:38:37,397
Okay.

770
00:38:40,184 --> 00:38:42,485
I told you not to
talk to April, right?

771
00:38:43,187 --> 00:38:44,253
I know.

772
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:45,521
Yet you did anyway.

773
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:47,457
I know that, too.

774
00:38:47,525 --> 00:38:50,910
You know, as hard as it
is for me to say this to you,

775
00:38:51,913 --> 00:38:53,345
thank you.

776
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:56,832
It seems like it was a good
thing, like you were right.

777
00:38:56,901 --> 00:38:58,634
Yes, I was.

778
00:39:00,055 --> 00:39:01,787
I got everything we need.

779
00:39:03,091 --> 00:39:04,874
"Need"? Wha...

780
00:39:04,942 --> 00:39:07,755
What she knew, when she knew
it, whom she spoke to, and when.

781
00:39:07,779 --> 00:39:10,892
I needed to confirm that she
withheld information from you

782
00:39:10,916 --> 00:39:12,827
when she was signing
those divorce papers,

783
00:39:12,851 --> 00:39:15,963
that she legally committed
fraud, and she did.

784
00:39:15,987 --> 00:39:18,722
And now we can go after her.

785
00:39:21,426 --> 00:39:24,861
<i>Don't stop. Don't hesitate.</i>

786
00:39:24,929 --> 00:39:26,849
<i>You can't be scared
of what's next.</i>

787
00:39:34,339 --> 00:39:36,579
I'm so sorry if I, if I did
something to hurt you. I...

788
00:39:36,608 --> 00:39:39,676
It's not... It's not you.

789
00:39:39,745 --> 00:39:43,930
I mean, it is you, but it's
not because you're you. It's...

790
00:39:46,768 --> 00:39:47,900
I'm...

791
00:39:47,969 --> 00:39:50,369
<i>Do not let fear get in your way.</i>

792
00:39:50,438 --> 00:39:53,539
I lost my husband two years ago,

793
00:39:53,608 --> 00:39:57,744
and you are the first person
that I've been with since.

794
00:39:59,831 --> 00:40:03,433
And this would be so much easier
if last night were awful or something.

795
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:07,620
I just have a lot of stuff.

796
00:40:09,791 --> 00:40:10,874
It's a lot.

797
00:40:13,278 --> 00:40:14,677
And you're great.

798
00:40:16,848 --> 00:40:18,347
And last night was great.

799
00:40:19,651 --> 00:40:21,717
Yeah, I thought so, too.

800
00:40:21,786 --> 00:40:23,666
But there's a "but."

801
00:40:24,622 --> 00:40:26,089
Yeah.

802
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,294
You're not ready.

803
00:40:31,362 --> 00:40:33,996
I guess I'm not. I want to be.

804
00:40:35,616 --> 00:40:38,117
Okay, then. I'll...

805
00:40:39,954 --> 00:40:44,090
I'll back off,
for a little while.

806
00:40:46,327 --> 00:40:48,827
But so you're prepared,

807
00:40:50,131 --> 00:40:51,730
I'm gonna call you again,

808
00:40:53,201 --> 00:40:54,934
and if you ignore me,

809
00:40:55,003 --> 00:40:59,405
I'm gonna show up again, and
we'll go back to sitting in that car,

810
00:40:59,474 --> 00:41:02,508
talking and laughing.

811
00:41:03,644 --> 00:41:06,913
And I'll be waiting
until you're ready

812
00:41:06,982 --> 00:41:11,717
because I'm pretty sure
you're worth waiting for.

813
00:41:16,625 --> 00:41:17,823
Good night.

814
00:41:20,562 --> 00:41:21,627
Good night.

815
00:41:27,268 --> 00:41:29,535
<i>That's why we
don't operate alone.</i>

816
00:41:29,604 --> 00:41:32,405
<i>There are attendings
and nurses and interns.</i>

817
00:41:32,474 --> 00:41:34,791
<i>Those ORs are full of people.</i>

818
00:41:36,194 --> 00:41:37,693
I'm fine.

819
00:41:37,762 --> 00:41:39,482
Are you sure? Is he gone?

820
00:41:40,648 --> 00:41:42,916
Yes, he's gone. Yes, I am sure.

821
00:41:42,984 --> 00:41:45,050
I am completely
and utterly fine.

822
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:50,707
I'm gonna go
check on the pizzas.

823
00:41:52,227 --> 00:41:54,160
Laundry's done, dishes are done,

824
00:41:54,229 --> 00:41:56,311
and I made a lunch
for Zola tomorrow.

825
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:57,713
Thanks.

826
00:41:57,782 --> 00:41:59,865
And I'm gonna go.

827
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:01,778
<i>So in the cases where
someone actually does get hurt...</i>

828
00:42:01,802 --> 00:42:03,970
You can stay in
your room if you want.

829
00:42:04,038 --> 00:42:05,071
It's clean.

830
00:42:13,832 --> 00:42:15,792
<i>Nobody has to
go through it alone.</i>
