1
00:00:05,388 --> 00:00:07,255
<i>We cover up injuries</i>

2
00:00:08,391 --> 00:00:10,692
<i>with tape and gauze...</i>

3
00:00:10,761 --> 00:00:12,389
Um, have you seen Dr. Avery?

4
00:00:12,413 --> 00:00:13,528
Upstairs in the lab.

5
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,883
<i>To protect the injury,</i>

6
00:00:17,952 --> 00:00:19,834
<i>to prevent infection,</i>

7
00:00:19,903 --> 00:00:22,154
<i>to save the patient
from further suffering.</i>

8
00:00:27,794 --> 00:00:30,794
<i>The hard part comes when
you have to rip the bandage off</i>

9
00:00:32,349 --> 00:00:34,309
<i>because that can hurt like hell.</i>

10
00:00:35,669 --> 00:00:37,068
Hey, how's it going?

11
00:00:38,171 --> 00:00:39,671
Uh, pretty good.

12
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:41,707
What's up? Nothing.

13
00:00:41,776 --> 00:00:43,587
Have you talked to April?

14
00:00:43,611 --> 00:00:45,077
No.

15
00:00:45,929 --> 00:00:48,046
Why?

16
00:00:48,115 --> 00:00:49,581
Nothing.

17
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:51,809
Um, I just wanted to see
how you guys were doing.

18
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:53,930
Have a good night. She knows.

19
00:00:53,954 --> 00:00:55,194
Knows?

20
00:00:55,489 --> 00:00:56,489
April knows.

21
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:58,140
What? Doesn't she?

22
00:00:58,208 --> 00:00:59,424
Who told her, Karev?

23
00:00:59,493 --> 00:01:02,194
I'm not sure...
Well, she told Karev.

24
00:01:02,263 --> 00:01:03,473
Um, or he figured it out.

25
00:01:03,497 --> 00:01:05,230
No, I mean, I told Karev.

26
00:01:05,299 --> 00:01:06,899
I just asked him to
keep it to himself.

27
00:01:06,951 --> 00:01:08,595
What, keep it to himself?
What are you talking about?

28
00:01:08,619 --> 00:01:10,785
That I'm seeing
people. That I'm dating.

29
00:01:10,854 --> 00:01:13,021
That I went on a date.

30
00:01:13,089 --> 00:01:15,056
So, April knows, huh?

31
00:01:16,876 --> 00:01:19,177
Uh, that you're
seeing other people.

32
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:21,023
Does April know? No!

33
00:01:21,047 --> 00:01:22,809
She doesn't. She doesn't
know anything about that.

34
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:24,749
So then what are
you talking about?

35
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:26,285
Nothing.

36
00:01:26,353 --> 00:01:28,954
I was... I was... Nothing.

37
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:31,557
All this is just so
weird and new.

38
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:34,976
I mean, I just really don't want April
to get her feelings hurt here, okay?

39
00:01:35,045 --> 00:01:37,746
So just do me a favor.

40
00:01:37,814 --> 00:01:39,564
Keep it to yourself.
That'd be great.

41
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:43,509
April's pregnant.

42
00:01:47,241 --> 00:01:49,073
April's pregnant.

43
00:01:50,661 --> 00:01:52,343
Yeah.

44
00:01:52,412 --> 00:01:53,892
Why are you telling me this?

45
00:01:55,182 --> 00:01:57,265
Jackson, can we...

46
00:01:57,333 --> 00:01:59,084
Why is she telling me this?

47
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:14,266
Um, did she happen to
say where we were eating?

48
00:02:14,335 --> 00:02:16,267
Uh, I think it's a steakhouse.

49
00:02:16,337 --> 00:02:18,503
Yeah, unless you're
not... If you don't.

50
00:02:18,572 --> 00:02:20,622
No, no. Fine.

51
00:02:20,691 --> 00:02:23,007
Love a good T-bone. Yeah.

52
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:24,175
Yes.

53
00:02:29,049 --> 00:02:31,883
Maybe... Maybe
we should call her.

54
00:02:34,622 --> 00:02:36,822
Oh, it's Mag... Uh, Dr. Pierce.

55
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:39,307
"Have to cancel...
Called into big transplant.

56
00:02:39,376 --> 00:02:41,943
"Really sorry, but you
two should still go."

57
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,779
Smiley face.

58
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:49,868
You know, truth be
told, um, I'm a little tired.

59
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,569
Me too.

60
00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:53,755
Rain check? Rain check.

61
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:55,590
Okay. Okay.

62
00:02:55,659 --> 00:02:57,275
Good. Okay.

63
00:03:01,581 --> 00:03:02,814
So, what do you say?

64
00:03:02,883 --> 00:03:04,932
Dr. Grey, would you
like to go out with me?

65
00:03:05,001 --> 00:03:07,302
I have said "no" to nicer faces.

66
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:09,616
Great, then this should
be easy. Yeah, it should.

67
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,133
Good, you're still here.

68
00:03:11,157 --> 00:03:12,808
We've got a transplant on deck.

69
00:03:12,876 --> 00:03:14,625
Uh, Karev was...

70
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:15,944
Sorry. It's fine.

71
00:03:16,013 --> 00:03:17,362
Hi. Will Thorpe.

72
00:03:17,431 --> 00:03:18,814
You're Thorpe.

73
00:03:18,882 --> 00:03:20,782
I mean, um, hello.

74
00:03:20,851 --> 00:03:21,933
Maggie Pierce.

75
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:23,268
Hi. Hi.

76
00:03:24,587 --> 00:03:26,016
Tell Alex I'll be right there.

77
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,906
Okay. All right,
I'll see you later.

78
00:03:27,974 --> 00:03:30,275
Bye. Or not.
Okay. All right. Bye.

79
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:32,009
So you've been talking about me.

80
00:03:32,078 --> 00:03:33,806
That's not necessarily
a good thing.

81
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:35,864
You haven't given me an answer.

82
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:39,467
Drinks. Tomorrow.

83
00:03:41,572 --> 00:03:44,972
Unless, of course,
I change my mind.

84
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:46,285
When were you gonna tell me?

85
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:47,575
Now. Right now.

86
00:03:47,645 --> 00:03:49,011
I was coming up to tell you now.

87
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:50,724
I'm supposed to
believe that? Yes!

88
00:03:50,748 --> 00:03:52,714
I can't believe that
Arizona would say...

89
00:03:52,783 --> 00:03:55,662
When did you know? How
far along are you, April?

90
00:03:55,686 --> 00:03:57,296
I'm 12 weeks. Twelve weeks.

91
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,987
I was coming to tell you...

92
00:03:59,056 --> 00:04:00,438
When did you know?

93
00:04:00,507 --> 00:04:01,601
Did you know before the divorce?

94
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:03,602
Did you know before
we signed those papers?

95
00:04:03,626 --> 00:04:06,661
April? Uh... I... Yes. I...

96
00:04:07,898 --> 00:04:10,332
Yes, I did. I knew before.

97
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,251
Why? Why would you do that?

98
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,148
I have to... I have
to go. No, you don't.

99
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:16,415
I am being paged to the ER.

100
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:18,840
Go give it to Grey or
Hunt or literally anybody,

101
00:04:18,909 --> 00:04:20,453
but you're not gonna walk
away from this right now.

102
00:04:20,477 --> 00:04:22,110
I want to talk
about this, Jackson.

103
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:24,241
I know we need to talk about
it, but now is not a good time.

104
00:04:24,265 --> 00:04:25,575
Don't you walk away. Okay?

105
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:27,199
I cannot talk about
this right now.

106
00:04:32,823 --> 00:04:35,556
You should get a dog.
You seem like a dog guy.

107
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:36,691
I live in a trailer.

108
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,504
Yeah, that's something
we can talk about.

109
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:39,694
You don't like my trailer?

110
00:04:39,763 --> 00:04:42,430
No, sure, I also like
grown-up houses.

111
00:04:42,498 --> 00:04:45,666
Listen, I was thinking we
could have dinner tomorrow?

112
00:04:45,736 --> 00:04:48,469
It's my birthday, and I
can't think of anyone else

113
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:49,816
I'd rather celebrate with, so...

114
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,917
Tomorrow's your birthday?

115
00:04:50,941 --> 00:04:52,373
No, no. It's next week,

116
00:04:52,442 --> 00:04:54,142
so you still have
time to buy my gift,

117
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:55,771
but I was thinking
we could, you know,

118
00:04:55,812 --> 00:04:57,946
kick things off with dinner.

119
00:04:58,014 --> 00:05:00,115
Do you like lobster?
Love lobster.

120
00:05:00,183 --> 00:05:01,460
You know how to cook lobster?

121
00:05:01,484 --> 00:05:03,351
Sure, you just boil
a pot of water and...

122
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:05,453
Yeah, see. You're
already losing me.

123
00:05:05,522 --> 00:05:07,238
Crap. Incoming.

124
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,918
Tomorrow night, then. Lobster.

125
00:05:08,942 --> 00:05:10,387
Birthday lobster,
which you are cooking.

126
00:05:10,411 --> 00:05:12,894
That's become obvious.

127
00:05:12,963 --> 00:05:16,109
We'll start with Kelsey's
double lung transplant first,

128
00:05:16,133 --> 00:05:17,910
and then, assuming
the procedure goes well,

129
00:05:17,934 --> 00:05:19,896
we'll go ahead and do
the liver and pancreas.

130
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,498
And it has to be all at once?

131
00:05:21,522 --> 00:05:24,122
Her CF has compromised
her lungs, liver, and pancreas.

132
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,768
Replace any one
of those organs now,

133
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:27,520
and the others are
just gonna break down.

134
00:05:27,544 --> 00:05:28,877
I know it seems overwhelming.

135
00:05:28,946 --> 00:05:30,489
The surgery's
long and extensive,

136
00:05:30,513 --> 00:05:31,679
but this is our best shot.

137
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:33,848
I don't want to do it.

138
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:35,111
Sweetie, please.

139
00:05:35,135 --> 00:05:36,729
Kelsey, you know
how important this is.

140
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:38,870
I don't care. I
don't want to do it.

141
00:05:41,425 --> 00:05:43,319
I hear you. It's a
bummer, though.

142
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:46,823
This donor is a perfect
match... One in a million.

143
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:49,670
You know, if we do this now,

144
00:05:49,732 --> 00:05:51,477
you can make your spring formal.

145
00:05:51,501 --> 00:05:53,451
Didn't you say what's
his name asked you?

146
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,852
Sam? Or Steve? Or...

147
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:56,003
Parker.

148
00:05:56,072 --> 00:05:58,539
Well, I guess Parker
can find someone else.

149
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:03,445
I don't want to go if I can only
sit and watch and be pitied.

150
00:06:03,514 --> 00:06:06,565
What, are you kidding
me? With these lungs?

151
00:06:06,633 --> 00:06:08,578
They're gonna have to
drag you off that dance floor.

152
00:06:08,602 --> 00:06:09,684
Really?

153
00:06:09,753 --> 00:06:11,069
Really.

154
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,506
So, Dr. Karev, how
do we proceed?

155
00:06:15,576 --> 00:06:16,841
What's the first step?

156
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:18,555
Is that the kid Alex
paged us about?

157
00:06:18,579 --> 00:06:20,779
Yep. Triple organ transplant.

158
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:23,381
Lungs, liver,
pancreas... The trifecta.

159
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:25,394
It's gonna be a long night.

160
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:27,402
I better text the sitter.

161
00:06:28,672 --> 00:06:30,616
So, not that it's any
of my business...

162
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,185
It's not. Mmm-hmm.

163
00:06:32,209 --> 00:06:34,025
He asked me out.
It's not a big deal.

164
00:06:34,094 --> 00:06:36,494
So you said no?

165
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:37,645
You said yes?

166
00:06:37,714 --> 00:06:39,264
Kind of.

167
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:40,765
Maybe.

168
00:06:40,818 --> 00:06:42,050
It's drinks.

169
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:45,148
Good. You're free. You awake?

170
00:06:45,172 --> 00:06:46,437
Yeah, I'm good.

171
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:47,705
This is good.

172
00:06:47,775 --> 00:06:48,907
Can we not?

173
00:06:48,976 --> 00:06:50,375
You're ready.

174
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:52,188
I thought I wasn't
ready with DeLuca,

175
00:06:52,212 --> 00:06:54,590
but now that it's out
in the open, it's good.

176
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:55,930
What's good?

177
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,176
Thorpe, the military doctor.

178
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,878
He asked Mer out. She said yes.

179
00:06:58,902 --> 00:07:00,335
She said yes to buy time.

180
00:07:00,403 --> 00:07:02,248
She'll blow him off
later. She'll cancel.

181
00:07:02,272 --> 00:07:03,933
You didn't see this
guy. I don't have to.

182
00:07:03,957 --> 00:07:05,117
I know Mer. I know Mer, too.

183
00:07:05,141 --> 00:07:06,770
I am Mer. Mer's right here.

184
00:07:06,794 --> 00:07:08,709
I said yes. I'm going.

185
00:07:08,778 --> 00:07:10,195
This is good.

186
00:07:10,264 --> 00:07:11,563
Blake, activate the MTP.

187
00:07:11,632 --> 00:07:13,876
We're gonna need
blood, lots of it. On it.

188
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:16,601
All right, patient's 10 minutes
out, people. Let's move.

189
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,981
April, I'm sorry. I'm so, so
sorry. I thought that I was...

190
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:20,499
I really don't give a
crap what you thought.

191
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:22,023
Listen, I was with you before.

192
00:07:22,092 --> 00:07:24,092
I lived through that
with you, with Jackson,

193
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,693
and I just was trying
to help somehow

194
00:07:25,762 --> 00:07:27,645
so that maybe this
time it could be different.

195
00:07:27,714 --> 00:07:30,815
Sorry, you were there?
You lived through that?

196
00:07:30,883 --> 00:07:32,334
Um, no. No, Arizona.

197
00:07:32,402 --> 00:07:34,297
That was me and
that was Jackson.

198
00:07:34,321 --> 00:07:38,022
We lived that nightmare,
and I refuse to live it again.

199
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:40,152
And you know what?
It is different this time,

200
00:07:40,176 --> 00:07:42,810
because this time I am
choosing to have faith

201
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,257
in a good outcome for this baby

202
00:07:44,281 --> 00:07:46,781
until God himself
tells me otherwise,

203
00:07:46,849 --> 00:07:49,750
and Jackson... Keps.

204
00:07:49,819 --> 00:07:52,153
I will deal with this myself,

205
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:55,040
the way I want
to, when I want to.

206
00:07:55,108 --> 00:07:56,568
I know. I'm sorry,
April. I thought...

207
00:07:56,592 --> 00:07:58,292
Don't. Don't think about me.

208
00:07:58,361 --> 00:08:02,497
Don't talk to me. Don't
even look at me, okay?

209
00:08:02,566 --> 00:08:05,767
And I believe in this stuff, so
understand how much I mean it

210
00:08:05,835 --> 00:08:08,002
when I tell you go to hell.

211
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:25,915
What, you didn't tell him?

212
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:27,506
Come on. Keps, what
were you thinking?

213
00:08:27,574 --> 00:08:29,251
Shut up. Well, of course
he had a right to know.

214
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:30,820
Shut up. I'm just saying...

215
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:32,889
Hey, I'm just saying
he's justified. All right?

216
00:08:32,913 --> 00:08:34,891
I'd be pissed, too.
I'd be really pissed.

217
00:08:39,836 --> 00:08:41,076
Twenty-eight-year-old female,

218
00:08:41,138 --> 00:08:43,237
fell over 100 feet
while rock climbing.

219
00:08:43,306 --> 00:08:46,491
GCS 12, intubated,
multiple extremity fractures.

220
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:47,871
Vitals are... Tess. Tess.

221
00:08:47,895 --> 00:08:49,127
Her name is Tess.

222
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:50,857
You want to watch him,
too. Mild signs of dehydration.

223
00:08:50,881 --> 00:08:52,330
I'm okay. Just
help Tess, please.

224
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:53,626
All right, Tess.
We got you, okay?

225
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:56,117
You stay with us, all
right? Stay with us.

226
00:08:56,186 --> 00:09:00,004
Volumes and total lung
capacity are perfect.

227
00:09:00,073 --> 00:09:02,185
Replantation is technically
easier on the right,

228
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:03,753
so we will do that side first.

229
00:09:03,777 --> 00:09:05,388
Thank you for coming back in.

230
00:09:05,412 --> 00:09:08,329
You really think I'd miss out
on a triple organ transplant?

231
00:09:08,398 --> 00:09:09,430
Hey.

232
00:09:09,499 --> 00:09:11,266
Oh, sorry.

233
00:09:11,335 --> 00:09:15,253
Um, can you make sure that
they have bypass on standby,

234
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:17,955
and, um, tell the blood
bank to have six units on hold.

235
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:19,307
Okay.

236
00:09:20,794 --> 00:09:22,505
Why aren't you at
dinner? We postponed.

237
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:25,246
It was really
weird. It's not weird.

238
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:27,109
Dinner for two with
Webber? It's weird.

239
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:29,011
It's what you wanted.
Out in the open.

240
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:30,813
If I'm gonna have dinner with
your dad, you should be there, too.

241
00:09:30,837 --> 00:09:32,665
I know. I'm sorry. I
just got pulled into this.

242
00:09:32,689 --> 00:09:34,033
You know, it's actually
gonna be really cool.

243
00:09:34,057 --> 00:09:35,818
Do you want to scrub in? Yeah.

244
00:09:35,842 --> 00:09:37,520
I've got Wilson and
Cross scrubbing in now,

245
00:09:37,544 --> 00:09:38,604
but I could switch things up.

246
00:09:38,628 --> 00:09:40,073
No, no, no. See, don't do that.

247
00:09:40,097 --> 00:09:41,417
We haven't even started yet.

248
00:09:41,464 --> 00:09:42,808
If Cross is your
intern, let him do it.

249
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:44,326
I'll... I'll see you tomorrow.

250
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:45,895
No, no, no. I can
get you both in there.

251
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:48,620
You can take turns holding
retractors or something.

252
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:50,768
I mean, don't you
want to see this?

253
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,250
Why? Got to wake up.

254
00:10:03,319 --> 00:10:05,486
Just got called into a
triple organ transplant.

255
00:10:05,555 --> 00:10:07,288
Whoa. Long night.

256
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,380
Callie? CALLIE: Mmm-hmm?

257
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:20,568
I have a thing...

258
00:10:22,339 --> 00:10:23,654
Tomorrow night.

259
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:25,356
Uh, more, please.

260
00:10:25,425 --> 00:10:27,392
Drinks with a guy.

261
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:30,456
Oh. You're getting back
on the horse! That's...

262
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,914
Ooh, is it the... Is it
the Thorpe horse?

263
00:10:32,982 --> 00:10:34,627
Please tell me it's
the Thorpe horse,

264
00:10:34,651 --> 00:10:36,161
because that is a hot horse.

265
00:10:36,185 --> 00:10:38,265
That is... That is Secretariat.

266
00:10:38,321 --> 00:10:40,121
No one's getting on a horse.

267
00:10:42,509 --> 00:10:43,808
It is gonna be weird.

268
00:10:43,877 --> 00:10:45,588
Well, at first it'll
be a little weird,

269
00:10:45,612 --> 00:10:47,957
but not bad weird,
and, Mer, it's good.

270
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:50,225
Just getting back
out there, it's...

271
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:51,489
It will be good.

272
00:10:53,787 --> 00:10:54,969
Thanks.

273
00:10:55,038 --> 00:10:57,283
Mmm-hmm.

274
00:10:59,443 --> 00:11:01,186
If it's bad, it's still
good, you know?

275
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:03,256
I mean, it's like trying to
remember how to ice skate.

276
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,480
A couple minutes, you're
like, "Whoa, oh, crap.

277
00:11:05,548 --> 00:11:06,798
"What... What am I doing?"

278
00:11:06,867 --> 00:11:09,178
But then... Then you
remember how it works

279
00:11:09,202 --> 00:11:13,304
and then it's like, "Oh,
yeah. Yeah, I can do this.

280
00:11:13,373 --> 00:11:15,706
"Oh, I like this.

281
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:17,920
"Ooh, ooh, I'm good at this."

282
00:11:17,944 --> 00:11:21,712
Ooh, ooh. It's skating
time, my friend.

283
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:24,898
Push and glide. Push and glide.

284
00:11:24,968 --> 00:11:26,608
I wouldn't mind. You
know what I'm saying?

285
00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:39,747
I'm more of a
roller girl, myself.

286
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:48,305
She's hypoxic on 100%.

287
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:50,019
Okay, she's gonna need
another tube on the right.

288
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:51,286
It's all right, Tess.
I'm right here.

289
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:52,638
Blake, can you get that? On it.

290
00:11:52,662 --> 00:11:54,462
Sir, Michael, you
need to leave the room.

291
00:11:54,531 --> 00:11:55,730
We need room to work.

292
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:57,343
Don't worry, baby. I'm
not gonna leave you, okay?

293
00:11:57,367 --> 00:11:58,533
I love you. I love you.

294
00:11:58,601 --> 00:12:00,296
I love you so much.

295
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,936
BP's dropping. What's happening?

296
00:12:02,004 --> 00:12:03,615
Free fluid in the belly
and she's still hypotensive

297
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:06,035
after multiple units of blood
and plasma. We got to get her up.

298
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:08,404
Blake, when you're done there, we
need to get her ready for transport.

299
00:12:08,428 --> 00:12:09,861
No, no, no. I can't leave her.

300
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:11,490
Your daughter suffered
severe injuries from the fall.

301
00:12:11,514 --> 00:12:12,913
We're doing everything we can.

302
00:12:12,983 --> 00:12:14,961
Is that her? Oh, my God. Tess.

303
00:12:14,985 --> 00:12:16,228
Another set of
hands up in the OR?

304
00:12:16,252 --> 00:12:17,568
I'll be right there.

305
00:12:17,637 --> 00:12:19,317
I love you, Tess. I
love you so much.

306
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:28,880
Michael. We told you.

307
00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:31,060
We told you not to take
her on that mountain.

308
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:34,030
Why are you always taking
her on those damn mountains?

309
00:12:34,054 --> 00:12:37,622
Uh, Is there a place, uh, where I
can wait for her during surgery?

310
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:38,801
We all want to wait.

311
00:12:38,825 --> 00:12:40,745
I'll take you all
somewhere more private.

312
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:44,673
All right. None of us knew
this was happening tonight,

313
00:12:44,697 --> 00:12:46,831
and we're all tired,
so let's be smart.

314
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,444
We have three
organs from the donor

315
00:12:48,468 --> 00:12:50,613
being transplanted
into the recipient.

316
00:12:50,637 --> 00:12:52,448
There'll be long stretches
where not everyone is needed.

317
00:12:52,472 --> 00:12:55,506
Take that time to
nap, eat, hydrate.

318
00:12:55,575 --> 00:12:57,935
Don't come into my
OR at less than 100%.

319
00:12:59,295 --> 00:13:01,596
Kelsey is prepped and ready.

320
00:13:01,665 --> 00:13:04,799
All right. Start time, 23:58.

321
00:13:06,069 --> 00:13:07,101
Ten blade.

322
00:13:07,169 --> 00:13:09,489
So we'll be up next, Cross.

323
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:13,319
Where's he taking
you? Did he say?

324
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:14,492
Let it go.

325
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,288
You still haven't
canceled that yet?

326
00:13:16,312 --> 00:13:18,174
What part of "let it go"
is confusing? Lap pads.

327
00:13:18,198 --> 00:13:19,697
I guess there's still time.

328
00:13:19,765 --> 00:13:21,248
This is gonna be
a very long night

329
00:13:21,317 --> 00:13:23,428
if you two keep
hounding me about this.

330
00:13:23,452 --> 00:13:26,172
Wilson, don't you have
anything to talk about?

331
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:28,305
Oh, um...

332
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:30,636
Her engagement ring is still in
the drawer in her bedside table.

333
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:32,694
Engagement ring?

334
00:13:32,762 --> 00:13:35,246
Steph, when was the
last time you had sex?

335
00:13:35,298 --> 00:13:36,458
All right. ALEX: If you're
gonna ditch the guy,

336
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:37,526
you better do it soon.

337
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:39,817
God, will you
shut it? You shut it.

338
00:13:39,886 --> 00:13:42,820
Both of you shut it. Balfour.

339
00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:45,334
And I have three children at
home, so don't think for a second

340
00:13:45,358 --> 00:13:47,269
I don't know you two are
making faces right now.

341
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:48,609
Settle in.

342
00:13:52,432 --> 00:13:54,765
So, is there no
directive in place?

343
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,428
Her fiance knows what she wants.

344
00:13:56,452 --> 00:13:58,347
They spend their spare
time dangling from cliffs.

345
00:13:58,371 --> 00:13:59,731
Of course they talked about it.

346
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:01,583
But he doesn't have
any rights, legally.

347
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:03,141
He's not her husband.

348
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:04,419
Just hoping to
call it an early day

349
00:14:04,443 --> 00:14:05,604
if we don't have
to save this girl?

350
00:14:05,628 --> 00:14:06,811
Guys. Malleable.

351
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,941
It'd be nice to know
what the patient wants.

352
00:14:08,965 --> 00:14:11,332
Well, we don't, so maybe
we don't just give up yet.

353
00:14:11,401 --> 00:14:13,033
I never said anything
about giving up.

354
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:14,886
Guys, come on.

355
00:14:16,373 --> 00:14:17,833
- Right angle.
- There you go.

356
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,206
Another.

357
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,557
Where are we?

358
00:14:25,581 --> 00:14:26,625
Should we scrub in?

359
00:14:26,649 --> 00:14:28,059
We just started the first lung.

360
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:30,062
You're early. Way early.

361
00:14:30,086 --> 00:14:32,303
I'd say she still has a
few more hours, right?

362
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:34,350
Plenty of time for you
to go take a shower,

363
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:36,924
get a change of clothes,
take a disco nap, groom.

364
00:14:36,993 --> 00:14:38,703
Cancel plans that
aren't gonna happen.

365
00:14:38,727 --> 00:14:39,910
Or stay.

366
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:41,740
I mean, this is a
triple organ transplant.

367
00:14:41,764 --> 00:14:43,058
I wouldn't nap through this.

368
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:45,499
Exactly. I'm here. I
might as well jump in.

369
00:14:45,568 --> 00:14:48,269
Go on. Scoot. You
take some "me" time.

370
00:14:48,338 --> 00:14:50,521
We will page you when you're up.

371
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:52,406
You are being ridiculous.

372
00:14:55,411 --> 00:14:57,361
Okay, would you stop? What?

373
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:59,024
She needs this. This is good.

374
00:14:59,048 --> 00:15:00,214
I know that.

375
00:15:00,283 --> 00:15:02,400
So stop being the
harbinger of doom about it.

376
00:15:02,469 --> 00:15:03,979
Stop being all
"whoo-yay" about it.

377
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:05,030
What are we talking about?

378
00:15:05,054 --> 00:15:06,271
You just stop.

379
00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:09,006
Alex, I have to be
positive, because if I'm not,

380
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:10,619
you're gonna make
her change her mind.

381
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:12,292
No, you are. Trust me.

382
00:15:12,361 --> 00:15:13,822
If she feels trapped,
she's gonna bolt.

383
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:15,324
Don't make a big
deal out of this.

384
00:15:15,348 --> 00:15:17,142
It's a big enough deal
already. I know it is.

385
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,011
You got to make her feel
like she has an escape hatch

386
00:15:19,035 --> 00:15:20,463
or she's gonna run for the hills.
- Yeah.

387
00:15:20,487 --> 00:15:22,927
She will, if you don't
shut your dumb mouth.

388
00:15:23,406 --> 00:15:24,889
You're dumb.

389
00:15:26,525 --> 00:15:28,476
Go update Kelsey's parents.

390
00:15:28,545 --> 00:15:30,289
We figure five
hours for the lungs,

391
00:15:30,313 --> 00:15:32,780
seven hours for the
liver and the pancreas,

392
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:34,014
so there's time.

393
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:35,249
For?

394
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:40,100
Edwards, where do
we keep the razor kits?

395
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:44,676
Oh.

396
00:15:46,346 --> 00:15:47,590
You know we have
a shower, right?

397
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:49,230
Yeah. I'm on a clock.

398
00:15:49,316 --> 00:15:50,316
Oh.

399
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,416
Oh.

400
00:15:52,485 --> 00:15:54,485
This is an emergency leg shave.

401
00:15:54,553 --> 00:15:57,171
It's not a big deal.
It's just drinks.

402
00:15:58,191 --> 00:15:59,223
What are you gonna wear?

403
00:16:01,394 --> 00:16:05,163
Uh, sports bra and
granny panties, apparently,

404
00:16:05,231 --> 00:16:08,032
or whatever is in my
locker from yesterday.

405
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:13,220
Why am I even doing
this? This is just... It's stupid.

406
00:16:13,289 --> 00:16:15,155
You know, I brought
a top with me today.

407
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:16,657
It's that one that you like.

408
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:19,043
It's the... It's kind of
see-through, and some heels.

409
00:16:19,112 --> 00:16:22,213
Actually, they're your
heels that I stole from you.

410
00:16:22,282 --> 00:16:23,764
Sorry.

411
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:25,499
You stole my shoes?

412
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:27,697
The black ones you said were
too slutty for a mother of three.

413
00:16:27,721 --> 00:16:28,986
Plus, they pinch a little,

414
00:16:29,055 --> 00:16:31,255
but they are so
worth it. So worth it.

415
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:33,991
I'll leave everything
out for you.

416
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,040
Thank you.

417
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,920
You didn't have to do that.

418
00:16:40,016 --> 00:16:41,282
I know.

419
00:16:46,155 --> 00:16:48,072
Hey, there you are.

420
00:16:48,141 --> 00:16:49,685
Um, I got a message
from Kayla's mom

421
00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:52,210
about a sleepover
with Sofia next week?

422
00:16:52,278 --> 00:16:54,245
Sure. Yeah. It's fine with me.

423
00:16:54,314 --> 00:16:55,634
Okay, great. Mmm-hmm.

424
00:16:58,084 --> 00:16:59,164
Is there something else?

425
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:00,752
Uh...

426
00:17:01,554 --> 00:17:02,787
No.

427
00:17:04,239 --> 00:17:05,740
No. You sure?

428
00:17:05,809 --> 00:17:06,974
I, um...

429
00:17:09,178 --> 00:17:11,479
I did something bad, I think...

430
00:17:11,548 --> 00:17:13,948
When I was trying so
hard to do something good.

431
00:17:14,016 --> 00:17:15,650
I thought that I was...

432
00:17:15,718 --> 00:17:18,052
I was being a good friend

433
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,954
and, I swear, I was.

434
00:17:20,022 --> 00:17:21,555
I was... I was right.

435
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:22,806
What was right?

436
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:26,411
April's pregnant.

437
00:17:26,479 --> 00:17:28,624
And she refused to tell Jackson.

438
00:17:28,648 --> 00:17:30,576
So... Hmm.

439
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,760
So I did.

440
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:34,385
What?

441
00:17:34,454 --> 00:17:36,699
And she's so angry
with me right now.

442
00:17:36,723 --> 00:17:38,567
Well... I mean, I did
the right thing, right?

443
00:17:38,591 --> 00:17:40,124
No, honey. No.

444
00:17:40,193 --> 00:17:41,942
But he's the other parent.

445
00:17:42,011 --> 00:17:43,906
If April's keeping
things from him...

446
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:45,390
Still. Still, no.
About the baby.

447
00:17:45,414 --> 00:17:47,659
About the baby's future
and the baby's health.

448
00:17:47,683 --> 00:17:48,961
Doesn't matter. Without him.

449
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:50,128
No, it still doesn't matter.

450
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:51,931
Yes, it does. No, Arizona!

451
00:17:51,955 --> 00:17:53,420
No. Just no.

452
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:54,772
Okay, so...

453
00:17:56,142 --> 00:17:58,091
What if it had been us?

454
00:17:58,161 --> 00:17:59,638
I mean, what if
we'd been trying,

455
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:01,790
and then suddenly I was
pregnant right when we split up.

456
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:04,660
And then wouldn't you...
Wouldn't you want to know that?

457
00:18:04,684 --> 00:18:06,584
Well, yes. Yes, of course.

458
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:09,454
But from you. Not
from someone else.

459
00:18:12,358 --> 00:18:16,109
I'm sorry. You screwed
this one up big time.

460
00:18:31,594 --> 00:18:32,960
Why aren't you down there?

461
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:34,595
I was on the procurement.

462
00:18:35,848 --> 00:18:36,992
Why aren't you down there?

463
00:18:37,016 --> 00:18:39,016
Don't you have an
all-access OR pass now?

464
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:42,069
Chief of cardio?

465
00:18:42,138 --> 00:18:44,238
So smart.

466
00:18:44,324 --> 00:18:47,091
But a guy who looks
like you can get anyone.

467
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:48,904
There's no way I'm
gonna land an attending.

468
00:18:48,928 --> 00:18:49,960
A resident, maybe.

469
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:51,946
I mean, Wilson is like...

470
00:18:55,685 --> 00:18:57,351
But she's with Karev.

471
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:58,769
Blake likes ladies.

472
00:18:58,837 --> 00:19:00,221
Edwards maybe, she's hot

473
00:19:00,289 --> 00:19:01,966
and she's tight with Shepherd,
so that wouldn't hurt either.

474
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:03,335
Do you think I have
a chance there?

475
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:05,593
No. No.

476
00:19:05,661 --> 00:19:06,938
Well, I got to hand
it to you, dude.

477
00:19:06,962 --> 00:19:08,762
You should go.

478
00:19:08,831 --> 00:19:11,112
'Cause I'm about
to nut punch you.

479
00:19:20,142 --> 00:19:22,643
Small intestine and
right colon excised.

480
00:19:22,712 --> 00:19:24,111
Bring this to path, please.

481
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:26,547
She's gonna need a TPN
when she's more stable.

482
00:19:26,616 --> 00:19:29,983
Dr. Kepner. Dr. Avery's
wondering how long you'll be.

483
00:19:30,052 --> 00:19:31,952
Tell him as long as I need to.

484
00:19:32,021 --> 00:19:33,821
Everything all right? I...

485
00:19:36,693 --> 00:19:38,892
It's fine. Medium clips.

486
00:19:38,961 --> 00:19:40,928
April. She said it was fine.

487
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:45,377
Pressure's dropping again.

488
00:19:45,401 --> 00:19:47,829
Pupils are dilated.
Non-responsive. Damn it.

489
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,949
Crap. Global ischemia
from the hypotension?

490
00:19:49,973 --> 00:19:51,683
Traumatic brain injury?
What difference does it make?

491
00:19:51,707 --> 00:19:53,184
Her brain's been
deprived of oxygen.

492
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:54,687
There's no coming
back from this point.

493
00:19:54,711 --> 00:19:56,944
Cabbage patch. OWEN: Damn it.

494
00:19:57,013 --> 00:20:00,331
Blake, step in and finish
creating the colostomy.

495
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,877
You comfortable with doing one?

496
00:20:01,901 --> 00:20:03,801
Uh, yeah. Sure.

497
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:07,249
Then I'd like you to close up
the fascia with running PDS.

498
00:20:07,273 --> 00:20:09,574
Me? Okay. Why are you leaving?

499
00:20:09,642 --> 00:20:11,320
'Cause there's
nothing left to do.

500
00:20:11,344 --> 00:20:12,943
Patient is too far gone.

501
00:20:13,011 --> 00:20:15,958
But it's not every day you
get to practice on living flesh,

502
00:20:15,982 --> 00:20:18,263
so perfect your
colostomy technique.

503
00:20:23,572 --> 00:20:25,572
I'll call Shepherd
for a neuro-eval.

504
00:20:25,642 --> 00:20:27,620
Yeah, but she's not
getting off that vent.

505
00:20:27,644 --> 00:20:30,845
So wrong. It's not fair.

506
00:20:30,913 --> 00:20:32,190
I'll let you know when
Shepherd's done,

507
00:20:32,214 --> 00:20:34,894
then we can go talk
to Tess' family. Okay.

508
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:37,084
Robbins?

509
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:38,897
You told Robbins
and you didn't tell me?

510
00:20:38,921 --> 00:20:41,405
I don't... I don't have time
for this right now, okay?

511
00:20:41,474 --> 00:20:43,818
You've taken more than
enough time, don't you think?

512
00:20:43,842 --> 00:20:46,204
The time was before I signed
the friggin' divorce papers.

513
00:20:46,228 --> 00:20:47,311
What's going on there?

514
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,146
Jackson, I'm not doing this.

515
00:20:49,198 --> 00:20:51,214
Not here. Not now.
Well, excuse me.

516
00:20:51,283 --> 00:20:52,528
Is there a more convenient time

517
00:20:52,552 --> 00:20:54,062
for me to catch you lying to me?

518
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,464
Jackson! You don't
think a pregnancy

519
00:20:55,488 --> 00:20:56,815
would have factored
into my decision

520
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:57,371
to move forward
with the divorce?

521
00:20:57,439 --> 00:20:58,689
I knew it would,

522
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:01,325
but you didn't want
to stay with me.

523
00:21:01,394 --> 00:21:03,360
You think I want you
to stay for my baby...

524
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:04,645
Our baby.

525
00:21:04,713 --> 00:21:06,358
And have you hating
me for the rest of my life?

526
00:21:06,382 --> 00:21:07,876
Well, you got a pretty good
jump on that, didn't you?

527
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,361
Wow, that... Yeah. That
didn't take any time at all.

528
00:21:09,385 --> 00:21:10,562
All right. That's enough.

529
00:21:10,586 --> 00:21:12,906
No, you know what?
It's fine. Screw this.

530
00:21:12,955 --> 00:21:14,399
You want to play
the martyr here?

531
00:21:14,423 --> 00:21:15,700
You want to pretend
you're doing this alone?

532
00:21:15,724 --> 00:21:16,869
Go for it.

533
00:21:16,893 --> 00:21:18,993
Knock yourself out.

534
00:21:19,061 --> 00:21:20,656
It's your deal, April. You win.

535
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,807
I'm out. I'm done.

536
00:21:21,831 --> 00:21:23,330
I said enough.

537
00:22:00,603 --> 00:22:02,714
What are you doing here?
I told you I would page you.

538
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:05,272
There's still a ton of time
before you need to be here.

539
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:06,702
I'm here. Let me help.

540
00:22:06,726 --> 00:22:09,843
Fine. Jump in. No. No.
Not fine. No jumping.

541
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:11,323
Maggie, you got to let it go.

542
00:22:11,347 --> 00:22:12,713
I can't let it go.

543
00:22:12,782 --> 00:22:14,593
You told me your train
had stopped running,

544
00:22:14,617 --> 00:22:16,661
and tonight, one is
coming into the station,

545
00:22:16,685 --> 00:22:18,135
and that is a big deal.

546
00:22:18,204 --> 00:22:19,298
I can't pretend like it's not.

547
00:22:19,322 --> 00:22:20,566
Wilson. Yes.

548
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:22,355
Go to the attendings
lounge, get my phone,

549
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:24,441
go into my contacts,
find William Thorpe,

550
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:25,737
please text him and let him know

551
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:27,928
that tonight's plans
have been canceled.

552
00:22:27,997 --> 00:22:29,374
Meredith, no! Wait, Meredith...

553
00:22:29,398 --> 00:22:31,615
My passcode is 1-0-0-8.

554
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:34,118
Now it's really
over. So let it go.

555
00:22:34,187 --> 00:22:35,986
Pickups.

556
00:22:36,055 --> 00:22:38,255
See what you did?
This is your fault.

557
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:54,839
Um, please, I just...

558
00:22:54,907 --> 00:22:56,968
I... I just need a minute, okay?

559
00:22:56,992 --> 00:22:59,994
Why didn't you tell me?

560
00:23:00,062 --> 00:23:03,422
Because, um, I didn't
want to tell anyone...

561
00:23:04,901 --> 00:23:07,634
Especially you. I
didn't want you to...

562
00:23:07,703 --> 00:23:11,138
I feel like I'm just... I'm
screwing everything up,

563
00:23:11,207 --> 00:23:15,209
and all I'm trying to do is
protect this baby and it's...

564
00:23:16,178 --> 00:23:18,212
It's all screwed up.

565
00:23:25,938 --> 00:23:28,939
Every... Everything
is all screwed up.

566
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,693
April, April.

567
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:37,581
April, you're having a baby.

568
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:39,433
Yeah. It's not screwed up.

569
00:23:40,236 --> 00:23:41,335
It's...

570
00:23:45,407 --> 00:23:47,057
It's a miracle.

571
00:23:49,795 --> 00:23:51,228
Yes, it is.

572
00:23:52,231 --> 00:23:53,363
Yes.

573
00:23:58,838 --> 00:24:00,203
Thank you.

574
00:24:09,247 --> 00:24:10,413
Bailey?

575
00:24:12,551 --> 00:24:14,084
Can I ask you something?

576
00:24:14,153 --> 00:24:15,313
You just did.

577
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:19,890
Well, um, I...

578
00:24:21,561 --> 00:24:23,794
I did something, and I don't...

579
00:24:23,863 --> 00:24:25,429
Yeah, I heard.

580
00:24:25,498 --> 00:24:27,230
Oh. Well, great.

581
00:24:27,283 --> 00:24:30,817
Yeah, you shared
confidential medical information

582
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:32,253
without permission,

583
00:24:32,321 --> 00:24:36,139
breaking multiple state
and federal privacy laws.

584
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:38,336
You did it to a fellow doctor,

585
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:41,495
under this roof, in my hospital.

586
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:44,464
Speaking as your boss,
that's a firing offense.

587
00:24:46,936 --> 00:24:49,135
And speaking to me as my friend?

588
00:24:57,113 --> 00:24:59,946
I mean, I can see
where you thought

589
00:25:00,015 --> 00:25:01,493
you were doing what was right.

590
00:25:01,517 --> 00:25:03,216
Yes! Yes, I was.

591
00:25:03,286 --> 00:25:04,851
That doesn't make it right.

592
00:25:11,093 --> 00:25:14,144
Yeah, I'm fresh out of
words of wisdom for you.

593
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:22,136
Okay.

594
00:25:35,401 --> 00:25:36,850
I got all day.

595
00:25:36,918 --> 00:25:38,463
I told you it's not
your business.

596
00:25:38,487 --> 00:25:40,299
Well, it is when you brawl
on the OR floor of my hospital.

597
00:25:40,323 --> 00:25:42,234
I don't need your
help! All right?

598
00:25:42,258 --> 00:25:44,486
Stop telling yourself that
I need your help. I don't.

599
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:45,910
You're not my father.

600
00:25:48,781 --> 00:25:50,247
I know I'm not.

601
00:25:54,153 --> 00:25:55,602
But who is?

602
00:25:58,157 --> 00:26:00,090
I don't see him
around here, do you?

603
00:26:02,178 --> 00:26:03,510
That the man you want to be?

604
00:26:06,415 --> 00:26:08,549
You're having a child.

605
00:26:10,218 --> 00:26:12,185
Maybe it's not the
way you wanted.

606
00:26:12,254 --> 00:26:13,787
Maybe it's not when.

607
00:26:15,157 --> 00:26:16,974
All right, so you
found out late.

608
00:26:18,176 --> 00:26:21,177
I found out decades late.

609
00:26:23,148 --> 00:26:26,617
What's important
is now you know.

610
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:30,386
It's happening...

611
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:34,390
And you need to step up.

612
00:26:35,861 --> 00:26:37,360
That's what matters.

613
00:26:39,632 --> 00:26:41,164
Unfortunately, in surgery,

614
00:26:41,233 --> 00:26:43,345
we discovered your daughter's
injuries were more catastrophic

615
00:26:43,369 --> 00:26:44,546
than we realized

616
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:46,380
and her brain function
has virtually ceased.

617
00:26:46,404 --> 00:26:48,872
Your daughter has
virtually no brain activity.

618
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:51,841
I am so sorry.

619
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:54,478
Oh, my God. But I saw her.

620
00:26:54,546 --> 00:26:55,829
Her heart is pumping.

621
00:26:55,898 --> 00:26:57,498
She's still breathing.

622
00:26:57,566 --> 00:26:58,598
She's alive.

623
00:26:58,667 --> 00:27:01,134
The ventilator is
breathing for her.

624
00:27:01,203 --> 00:27:05,155
She can't breathe on her own or
feed herself or use the bathroom.

625
00:27:05,223 --> 00:27:07,173
She's using catheters
and ostomies

626
00:27:07,243 --> 00:27:09,909
and will likely need
those indefinitely.

627
00:27:09,978 --> 00:27:11,144
From this point on,

628
00:27:11,213 --> 00:27:14,125
she will require round-the-clock
professional care,

629
00:27:14,149 --> 00:27:16,015
probably for the
rest of her life.

630
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,169
Or until she gets better.

631
00:27:20,572 --> 00:27:21,672
I'm sorry?

632
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:23,973
She'll need the care
until she gets better,

633
00:27:24,042 --> 00:27:26,710
until she wakes up and
she can leave the hospital.

634
00:27:26,778 --> 00:27:28,512
Do we know when that might be?

635
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:31,631
When Tess could leave here?

636
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:35,736
Eventually, she would be moved
to a long-term acute care facility

637
00:27:35,804 --> 00:27:38,204
where she would live
for the rest of her...

638
00:27:39,158 --> 00:27:41,419
Well, we can... We can
get you some brochures

639
00:27:41,443 --> 00:27:43,160
if that's what you decide.

640
00:27:43,228 --> 00:27:46,512
Or if you decide
to withdraw care.

641
00:27:46,581 --> 00:27:47,621
Oh, Tess.

642
00:27:47,649 --> 00:27:49,177
I understand
that this is difficult,

643
00:27:49,201 --> 00:27:50,629
and you should take
some time to talk this over.

644
00:27:50,653 --> 00:27:52,714
That won't be necessary. We
understand the circumstances.

645
00:27:52,738 --> 00:27:54,621
We want you to do
everything that you can

646
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:56,957
to save our daughter.

647
00:27:57,025 --> 00:27:59,459
No! This is not what she'd want.

648
00:27:59,528 --> 00:28:00,827
She could wake up.

649
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:02,816
I mean, people wake up
from comas all the time.

650
00:28:04,383 --> 00:28:08,885
I'm sorry, but in Tess'
case, that's highly unlikely.

651
00:28:08,954 --> 00:28:12,139
She told me what she
wants. More than once.

652
00:28:12,208 --> 00:28:14,241
Please, she would
not want to live like this.

653
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:15,675
What is wrong with you?

654
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:17,422
This isn't your decision
to make, Michael.

655
00:28:17,446 --> 00:28:18,856
If this had happened two
months from now, it would be.

656
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,958
We would've been married.

657
00:28:19,982 --> 00:28:21,715
Will you get him out of here?

658
00:28:24,169 --> 00:28:25,169
Lines are out.

659
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:26,687
Almost done?

660
00:28:26,755 --> 00:28:29,439
Anastomoses look
terrific on both sides.

661
00:28:29,508 --> 00:28:31,424
No bleeding or leaks.

662
00:28:31,493 --> 00:28:32,653
Sats look great.

663
00:28:32,712 --> 00:28:33,877
Yeah, nice work.

664
00:28:33,946 --> 00:28:35,323
Well, uh, that does it for me,

665
00:28:35,347 --> 00:28:39,649
unless you need
me to stay and help...

666
00:28:39,719 --> 00:28:41,245
In any way. I'll close.

667
00:28:41,269 --> 00:28:42,269
You can go.

668
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:47,106
Scalpel.

669
00:28:50,996 --> 00:28:52,874
So, what's wrong
with the guy? Huh?

670
00:28:52,898 --> 00:28:55,181
Thorpe. What's his deal?

671
00:28:57,652 --> 00:28:59,652
Nothing. He's fine.

672
00:28:59,721 --> 00:29:01,716
Callie said he was a
jerk that night at Bauer.

673
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,822
That's not true.

674
00:29:02,891 --> 00:29:04,836
Said he almost
killed the surgery.

675
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:06,126
Scissors.

676
00:29:06,195 --> 00:29:07,393
Ten blade.

677
00:29:07,462 --> 00:29:09,696
He was just trying
to protect his patient.

678
00:29:09,764 --> 00:29:13,182
Oh. So he was throwing
a tantrum like a toddler.

679
00:29:13,235 --> 00:29:15,118
Shut up.

680
00:29:15,187 --> 00:29:17,370
He's nice... And he's funny.

681
00:29:17,456 --> 00:29:19,267
Mmm, so he's just butt-ugly.

682
00:29:19,291 --> 00:29:21,992
Yes. He is butt-ugly.

683
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,426
Yeah, well.

684
00:29:23,495 --> 00:29:26,797
It's hard first time out
after somebody important.

685
00:29:26,865 --> 00:29:30,767
First girl after Izzie
left? It was pretty messy.

686
00:29:30,836 --> 00:29:32,764
You feel like you
belong to somebody else,

687
00:29:32,788 --> 00:29:34,566
like you're cheating, you know?

688
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:37,790
I mean, you're not, but
man, sure feels that way.

689
00:29:39,161 --> 00:29:41,361
I never had a wife die, but...

690
00:29:42,648 --> 00:29:45,298
I've had a few "first
time afters," Mer.

691
00:29:45,367 --> 00:29:47,412
There's always
something after...

692
00:29:47,436 --> 00:29:48,636
Eventually.

693
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:51,371
We lose people and
then we find new ones.

694
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,939
It's how it works.

695
00:29:54,976 --> 00:29:56,976
- I guess.
- Oh, I know.

696
00:29:57,012 --> 00:29:59,546
Look, if you're not
into him, who cares?

697
00:29:59,614 --> 00:30:02,715
But if you are, it's okay.

698
00:30:02,784 --> 00:30:03,917
Okay?

699
00:30:07,273 --> 00:30:09,055
Okay.

700
00:30:09,124 --> 00:30:11,118
Plus, it's gonna be
weird no matter what,

701
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:13,342
so you might as
well get it over with.

702
00:30:13,845 --> 00:30:15,145
Suction.

703
00:30:20,452 --> 00:30:22,852
Yeah, she should be awake soon.

704
00:30:22,921 --> 00:30:24,999
Looks like she's gonna
make that big dance.

705
00:30:25,023 --> 00:30:26,673
No more coughing and wheezing?

706
00:30:26,742 --> 00:30:28,569
Well, the new organs
don't carry the CF gene.

707
00:30:28,593 --> 00:30:29,859
Once she's off the vent,

708
00:30:29,928 --> 00:30:33,328
chances are good you'll
never see her on one again.

709
00:30:33,431 --> 00:30:34,681
Thank you.

710
00:30:57,223 --> 00:30:58,783
She's gonna stay
on that ventilator...

711
00:30:59,592 --> 00:31:00,624
Forever?

712
00:31:00,693 --> 00:31:03,193
Unless something changes, yes.

713
00:31:08,183 --> 00:31:11,251
Her parents will hate me forever
for taking her up that mountain.

714
00:31:14,472 --> 00:31:16,272
She'll hate me for
bringing her back down.

715
00:31:24,683 --> 00:31:25,932
This place looks nice.

716
00:31:26,618 --> 00:31:28,284
Lovely views.

717
00:31:28,353 --> 00:31:29,920
And who knows?

718
00:31:29,988 --> 00:31:33,423
She could be up and walking
again this time next year.

719
00:31:33,492 --> 00:31:34,875
You never know.

720
00:31:36,211 --> 00:31:37,744
Don't give up hope, right?

721
00:31:39,631 --> 00:31:41,531
God bless you, Dr. Riggs.

722
00:31:48,407 --> 00:31:49,806
"Don't give up hope," huh?

723
00:31:49,875 --> 00:31:51,419
Well, that's all they
have now, right?

724
00:31:51,443 --> 00:31:53,154
You changed your tune.
You wanted to give up all day.

725
00:31:53,178 --> 00:31:55,590
No, I did not. I wanted to
do what the patient wanted.

726
00:31:55,614 --> 00:31:57,642
Owen, you got to let
this go. Oh, what's that?

727
00:31:57,666 --> 00:31:59,711
If you're still feeling
guilty after all this time,

728
00:31:59,735 --> 00:32:00,900
that's your deal.

729
00:32:00,969 --> 00:32:02,585
Stop taking it out on me.

730
00:32:02,654 --> 00:32:04,048
Guilty? What have I
got to feel guilty about?

731
00:32:04,072 --> 00:32:06,239
Oh, you think it's all
my fault, but I never quit.

732
00:32:06,307 --> 00:32:07,440
You did.

733
00:32:07,509 --> 00:32:08,908
You let Megan go.

734
00:32:08,977 --> 00:32:10,176
You stopped looking.

735
00:32:10,245 --> 00:32:12,479
I didn't. I stayed
behind. I stayed. I looked.

736
00:32:12,547 --> 00:32:13,714
I searched, and I prayed.

737
00:32:13,782 --> 00:32:15,065
Because you got her killed!

738
00:32:15,134 --> 00:32:17,234
We don't know
that. You decided it.

739
00:32:18,337 --> 00:32:20,136
You made a decision
that she was dead.

740
00:32:20,205 --> 00:32:22,005
You came back
here, you started over,

741
00:32:22,073 --> 00:32:23,774
and you forgot about her.

742
00:32:23,842 --> 00:32:25,754
You shut your mouth. That's
why you hate that I'm here,

743
00:32:25,778 --> 00:32:29,029
'cause I remind you of what
you did, that you gave up on her.

744
00:32:29,098 --> 00:32:30,325
I swear to God...

745
00:32:30,349 --> 00:32:32,189
People here don't even
know you had a sister.

746
00:32:33,285 --> 00:32:34,634
That's sick, mate.

747
00:32:36,538 --> 00:32:37,970
You need to hate someone?

748
00:32:38,907 --> 00:32:40,307
Look in a mirror.

749
00:32:52,487 --> 00:32:53,820
You had a tough day.

750
00:32:54,623 --> 00:32:55,955
You heard, too?

751
00:32:56,024 --> 00:32:58,357
I think everybody's
heard by now.

752
00:32:58,427 --> 00:32:59,559
Right.

753
00:33:01,847 --> 00:33:04,548
I don't know what to do.

754
00:33:04,599 --> 00:33:05,949
I want to make it right.

755
00:33:06,018 --> 00:33:08,051
I mean, I have to
make it right somehow,

756
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,264
but I don't know what to do.

757
00:33:09,288 --> 00:33:11,488
I don't... I don't
know how to fix it.

758
00:33:11,557 --> 00:33:13,877
You did something indefensible.

759
00:33:17,479 --> 00:33:18,778
Right.

760
00:33:20,682 --> 00:33:22,415
So maybe, um...

761
00:33:23,852 --> 00:33:26,135
Maybe I go to her
again and apologize.

762
00:33:26,205 --> 00:33:28,705
The only thing that
you can do right now

763
00:33:28,773 --> 00:33:31,093
is accept what
you did was wrong.

764
00:33:32,227 --> 00:33:34,394
And the only thing
you can do to fix it is...

765
00:33:36,081 --> 00:33:37,380
To wait.

766
00:33:39,284 --> 00:33:40,550
Just give it time

767
00:33:43,138 --> 00:33:45,605
and maybe April
will forgive you.

768
00:33:46,625 --> 00:33:48,157
Maybe she won't...

769
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,493
But you...

770
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:53,697
That is not up to you.

771
00:34:11,399 --> 00:34:12,876
Hey. DELUCA: Hey.

772
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:14,746
How's the, uh... How's
the transplant going?

773
00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:17,253
Huge success. Come
on. I'll tell you all about it.

774
00:34:17,306 --> 00:34:19,883
Actually, um, I think I'm
gonna stay here tonight.

775
00:34:19,907 --> 00:34:22,320
I got early rounds in the morning
and kind of want to just study.

776
00:34:22,344 --> 00:34:24,864
Come over. I'll help you
study. I don't want help.

777
00:34:26,014 --> 00:34:27,164
Okay.

778
00:34:27,232 --> 00:34:29,044
I don't want special treatment,

779
00:34:29,068 --> 00:34:31,212
and I don't want to
miss out on things,

780
00:34:31,236 --> 00:34:33,081
but that's already happening.

781
00:34:33,105 --> 00:34:35,599
And I don't want to make
awkward small talk with Dr. Webber.

782
00:34:35,623 --> 00:34:37,383
You are the one who
wanted us to go public.

783
00:34:37,425 --> 00:34:38,808
I know.

784
00:34:39,544 --> 00:34:40,893
I know.

785
00:34:40,962 --> 00:34:43,929
I'm just gonna study, all right?

786
00:34:46,001 --> 00:34:47,366
Okay.

787
00:34:48,970 --> 00:34:50,336
I'll see you tomorrow.

788
00:35:24,456 --> 00:35:25,688
Hey.

789
00:35:28,076 --> 00:35:30,343
Hey. I'm glad you
called me back.

790
00:35:30,411 --> 00:35:33,079
Well, I shouldn't have.
I'm way too tired for drinks.

791
00:35:33,148 --> 00:35:35,231
I just got out of a
17-hour surgery.

792
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:40,186
I probably shouldn't even drive home
until I've crashed here for a while, so...

793
00:35:40,254 --> 00:35:42,922
So how about I take you home?

794
00:35:42,991 --> 00:35:45,208
Um, you're skipping a bunch
of steps, don't you think?

795
00:35:45,276 --> 00:35:47,693
Yeah, how about I
give you a ride home

796
00:35:47,763 --> 00:35:49,891
so that you can
crash in your own bed?

797
00:35:49,915 --> 00:35:51,881
I don't mind.

798
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:54,601
Look, I know what 17
hours straight feels like.

799
00:35:54,669 --> 00:35:57,069
I'm not worried
about the drinks.

800
00:35:57,255 --> 00:35:59,695
I'll take you out
some other time.

801
00:36:23,114 --> 00:36:25,114
Hey! Happy birthday!

802
00:36:31,389 --> 00:36:32,655
Owen! Come on.

803
00:36:32,724 --> 00:36:36,292
I'm holding a box of
creepy, squirming lobsters.

804
00:36:36,361 --> 00:36:37,893
You gonna let me in?

805
00:36:37,962 --> 00:36:39,106
Just a sec.

806
00:36:42,383 --> 00:36:43,466
Hey.

807
00:36:43,535 --> 00:36:45,502
Am I early?

808
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:47,515
Uh, no, no, no. We're all good.

809
00:36:47,539 --> 00:36:50,306
I was just gonna... Uh, come in.

810
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:51,741
Come on.

811
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:58,926
Looks like you already
started the party.

812
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:01,134
No, no. I might've
screwed up a little.

813
00:37:01,203 --> 00:37:04,153
I forgot that we were...

814
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:05,899
I'll just put these in
the fridge, I guess.

815
00:37:05,923 --> 00:37:08,074
Yes, I... I... I can
put some water on.

816
00:37:08,143 --> 00:37:09,720
It'll just take a
minute to boil.

817
00:37:09,744 --> 00:37:12,312
I had a long day,

818
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:14,881
and Riggs is...

819
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:16,199
Riggs is what?

820
00:37:17,985 --> 00:37:19,251
Nothing, it's just...

821
00:37:20,221 --> 00:37:21,354
Don't listen to him.

822
00:37:23,892 --> 00:37:25,012
Um...

823
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:31,530
Let's try this another time.

824
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:32,899
No, no, no. No.

825
00:37:32,967 --> 00:37:34,545
No, let's do it. No,
let's not, Owen.

826
00:37:34,569 --> 00:37:36,030
Amelia. I'm just...
I'm gonna go.

827
00:37:36,054 --> 00:37:37,587
It's fine. I'm fine.

828
00:37:37,655 --> 00:37:39,733
Amelia, don't go. I'm sorry.

829
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:41,917
I just had a couple of beers.

830
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:11,554
Who is it?

831
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:13,389
It's me.

832
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:30,423
Hey, I just wanted to apologize.

833
00:38:34,512 --> 00:38:40,049
I reacted badly today, and...

834
00:38:40,118 --> 00:38:42,318
We're having a baby...

835
00:38:44,088 --> 00:38:47,107
Who does not deserve
to have us arguing over it.

836
00:38:49,094 --> 00:38:51,454
That's what I was
trying to avoid.

837
00:38:51,663 --> 00:38:52,929
I get that.

838
00:38:54,065 --> 00:38:55,932
Sort of. I mean, I'm...

839
00:38:56,001 --> 00:38:57,250
I'm trying to get that.

840
00:38:58,370 --> 00:38:59,719
We can figure this out.

841
00:39:01,406 --> 00:39:02,588
All right?

842
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:09,479
Yeah.

843
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,362
Look, I just... I
honestly... I didn't...

844
00:39:16,254 --> 00:39:18,734
I waited to tell you
because last time...

845
00:39:20,458 --> 00:39:22,091
Last time tore us apart.

846
00:39:23,094 --> 00:39:24,527
Literally.

847
00:39:24,596 --> 00:39:26,290
Neither one of us
could help the other

848
00:39:26,314 --> 00:39:29,354
and everyone got hurt,
and I just didn't want that.

849
00:39:30,151 --> 00:39:33,019
For you or me.

850
00:39:33,087 --> 00:39:35,655
I just... I wanted
to wait until I knew

851
00:39:35,723 --> 00:39:36,934
that everything was okay,

852
00:39:36,958 --> 00:39:39,438
and I'm... I am...
I am really sorry.

853
00:39:40,128 --> 00:39:41,761
Okay? I'm sorry.

854
00:39:46,885 --> 00:39:50,169
You wanted to wait
until it was too late?

855
00:39:50,238 --> 00:39:53,839
Right? Until you were too far
along to do anything about it.

856
00:39:53,908 --> 00:39:56,476
I'm sorry. Do what, exactly?

857
00:39:56,545 --> 00:39:58,761
I don't know... Not put
us through this again,

858
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:00,412
or a baby, for that matter.

859
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:02,482
I mean, I'd have to
hold him while he dies.

860
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:04,316
Maybe have some options.

861
00:40:04,385 --> 00:40:07,331
Um, that is not an option
for me and you know that.

862
00:40:07,355 --> 00:40:08,538
What about me?

863
00:40:09,457 --> 00:40:10,824
Hmm?

864
00:40:10,892 --> 00:40:13,132
What about my option...
You don't count here.

865
00:40:14,529 --> 00:40:16,139
I don't... I'm the father.

866
00:40:16,163 --> 00:40:17,880
Yes, you are. Yes.

867
00:40:17,949 --> 00:40:19,794
You're the father
when there's a baby.

868
00:40:19,818 --> 00:40:22,852
But right now, you
have no choice in this.

869
00:40:22,921 --> 00:40:25,338
It's my body, my baby.

870
00:40:25,407 --> 00:40:29,259
April. You are not my husband.

871
00:40:29,327 --> 00:40:31,060
You have no rights here.

872
00:40:39,438 --> 00:40:41,616
<i>It hurts to tear
that bandage off.</i>

873
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:44,607
<i>We don't want to see
what's underneath.</i>

874
00:40:44,676 --> 00:40:48,110
<i>But maybe it's not the fear
of the pain that holds us back.</i>

875
00:40:48,179 --> 00:40:51,463
I was worried about the
duodenal segment getting ischemic.

876
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:53,666
Mmm. Yeah, what'd you do?

877
00:40:53,735 --> 00:40:58,004
Mmm, I placed stents at the
SMA and the celiac anastomoses,

878
00:40:58,073 --> 00:40:59,272
just to be on the safe side.

879
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:00,690
Smart.

880
00:41:01,426 --> 00:41:02,426
Ketchup?

881
00:41:03,929 --> 00:41:05,962
More ketchup? I love my ketchup.

882
00:41:07,482 --> 00:41:09,949
I did a portal
reconstruction once...

883
00:41:10,018 --> 00:41:12,763
Good guy, had no idea
he drank a fifth a day

884
00:41:12,787 --> 00:41:15,188
until I tried to
cut into his liver.

885
00:41:15,257 --> 00:41:17,737
You know, it's
shoe leather. Ugh.

886
00:41:18,593 --> 00:41:19,725
That makes it so hard.

887
00:41:19,794 --> 00:41:20,871
Yeah.

888
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:22,561
Napkin.

889
00:41:24,099 --> 00:41:26,532
I almost stopped
drinking right then.

890
00:41:28,019 --> 00:41:29,868
Almost.

891
00:41:30,805 --> 00:41:32,705
Yeah.

892
00:41:32,773 --> 00:41:34,223
I don't want to see my liver.

893
00:41:34,292 --> 00:41:35,920
I don't want to see it, either.

894
00:41:40,015 --> 00:41:41,897
<i>Maybe we're really afraid</i>

895
00:41:41,966 --> 00:41:44,834
<i>to see if the wound
underneath is still open...</i>

896
00:41:44,902 --> 00:41:46,369
I should go up.

897
00:41:47,038 --> 00:41:48,098
Yeah.

898
00:41:48,122 --> 00:41:49,822
Yeah, okay.

899
00:41:56,664 --> 00:41:58,275
You know what I did
do that was funny?

900
00:41:58,299 --> 00:42:01,267
I used an interposition
aortic conduit

901
00:42:01,335 --> 00:42:03,770
to supply the pancreatic graft.

902
00:42:05,173 --> 00:42:06,967
How did... How did you do that?

903
00:42:10,478 --> 00:42:14,113
<i>Or if it might
actually be healing.</i>
