1
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:05,304
<i>Sometimes, you
can't go it alone.</i>

2
00:00:06,323 --> 00:00:09,775
<i>You need someone on your side.</i>

3
00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:13,312
<i>In medicine, we have surgical
assists, second opinions...</i>

4
00:00:13,381 --> 00:00:17,049
I'm sure Amelia's
up. Let's just wait.

5
00:00:17,118 --> 00:00:19,662
No. If my kids can get up
and get dressed on time,

6
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:20,719
then so can she.

7
00:00:20,787 --> 00:00:21,831
Okay.

8
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:23,222
<i>We stack our deck.</i>

9
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:24,334
We can't just leave her.

10
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:25,457
Yes, we can.

11
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:26,903
She's made me
late too many times.

12
00:00:26,927 --> 00:00:29,689
She knows better than
to be late for carpool.

13
00:00:29,713 --> 00:00:30,962
Don't look.

14
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,559
<i>We're dealing with
life and death here.</i>

15
00:00:32,583 --> 00:00:34,260
What? Go to the
car. Go to the car.

16
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:35,434
Hey!

17
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:38,286
Oh!

18
00:00:38,355 --> 00:00:40,772
Uh... Oh, uh...

19
00:00:40,841 --> 00:00:43,386
<i>You don't want to get
caught with your pants down.</i>

20
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:44,676
We fell asleep.

21
00:00:44,745 --> 00:00:45,944
Someone was awake.

22
00:00:46,012 --> 00:00:47,178
Yeah.

23
00:00:47,248 --> 00:00:48,541
Major Hunt reporting for duty.

24
00:00:48,565 --> 00:00:49,893
Can we not talk about it?

25
00:00:49,917 --> 00:00:51,895
I don't know why
you're embarrassed.

26
00:00:51,919 --> 00:00:54,152
We should be congratulating you.

27
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:55,966
Now I know what Cristina saw.

28
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:57,934
I think we all learned
something today.

29
00:00:57,958 --> 00:00:59,752
I'm gonna grab a
different ride home.

30
00:00:59,776 --> 00:01:01,843
Don't worry. I'm
sure after this morning

31
00:01:01,912 --> 00:01:04,541
Owen will want you guys to
spend the night at his place.

32
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:06,309
No, I'm not gonna see
him tonight or any night.

33
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:07,999
That... That was the last time.

34
00:01:08,069 --> 00:01:09,868
We cannot be in a relationship.

35
00:01:09,937 --> 00:01:12,971
I've got too much stuff.
Owen's got too much stuff.

36
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,706
Yeah, we all saw his stuff.

37
00:01:14,775 --> 00:01:16,819
Yeah. Yeah.

38
00:01:16,843 --> 00:01:18,510
Wait. Shut up.

39
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:19,819
Nice one.

40
00:01:21,515 --> 00:01:24,616
I'm saying, you better
stay out of my OR.

41
00:01:24,685 --> 00:01:26,885
And if my department
heads are smart,

42
00:01:26,954 --> 00:01:29,154
they'll say the same thing.

43
00:01:29,222 --> 00:01:30,372
Shower's free.

44
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,485
So, you just gonna
sabotage me, huh,

45
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:34,843
turn the whole
hospital against me.

46
00:01:34,912 --> 00:01:36,990
You don't think maybe
you're sabotaging yourself?

47
00:01:37,014 --> 00:01:40,093
You lose nothing by letting
me work as an anesthesiologist.

48
00:01:40,117 --> 00:01:43,084
I'm still falling behind,
getting talked about.

49
00:01:43,153 --> 00:01:45,148
It's humiliating, which
should make you very happy.

50
00:01:45,172 --> 00:01:47,872
There ain't nothing of
this makes me happy.

51
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:50,542
This is about you
learning from what you did.

52
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:52,260
No, no, no.

53
00:01:52,329 --> 00:01:54,291
This is about you
disagreeing with what I did

54
00:01:54,315 --> 00:01:56,208
and being embarrassed
that you were wearing my ring

55
00:01:56,232 --> 00:01:58,400
when I did it.

56
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:01,069
So I will see you at work. Oh!

57
00:02:06,409 --> 00:02:08,009
I have to get
Meredith on my side.

58
00:02:08,078 --> 00:02:09,377
People will follow her lead.

59
00:02:09,446 --> 00:02:11,257
Grey is going to take your side.

60
00:02:11,281 --> 00:02:12,391
She might side with Arizona.

61
00:02:12,415 --> 00:02:14,049
They were in a
plane crash together.

62
00:02:14,118 --> 00:02:15,483
You'll be fine.

63
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:17,330
You're just saying
that 'cause you like me.

64
00:02:17,354 --> 00:02:19,054
Today's the day I
lose all my friends.

65
00:02:19,123 --> 00:02:20,433
You won't. I might.

66
00:02:20,457 --> 00:02:22,285
I won't. I won't do it.

67
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:24,721
And why is it my job to
ask my friends to testify?

68
00:02:24,745 --> 00:02:26,022
Isn't that the subpoena's job?

69
00:02:26,046 --> 00:02:27,156
Oh, I imagine you'd want to know

70
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,247
who'll be a sympathetic witness.

71
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:32,651
So, I have to ask
people to choose sides?

72
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,166
Just ask your friends
to help you out.

73
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:40,125
That's all. Uh, look... Try it.

74
00:02:41,562 --> 00:02:43,094
Okay, um, well, I'm...

75
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,697
Okay, I'm gonna see
April, so that's in the bag.

76
00:02:45,766 --> 00:02:47,766
And then there's
Jackson, who's an Avery.

77
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:50,168
So, I mean, if I get
them, then I'm good, right?

78
00:02:50,237 --> 00:02:51,436
Thanks.

79
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:53,271
I tell my children,

80
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,435
when you're finished with
your toys, put them away.

81
00:02:55,459 --> 00:02:56,658
Uh, good morning.

82
00:02:56,726 --> 00:02:57,938
And my kids don't
need to see your penis,

83
00:02:57,962 --> 00:02:59,205
so the same goes for you.

84
00:02:59,229 --> 00:03:00,728
Meredith, please.

85
00:03:00,797 --> 00:03:03,765
There was a time I
would ask, but I've learned.

86
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:06,996
What have we got?
Leo Paulson, 76,

87
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,197
fell down a flight of stairs.

88
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:09,382
Initially complaining
of back pain.

89
00:03:09,406 --> 00:03:10,772
Is he gonna be all right?

90
00:03:10,841 --> 00:03:13,841
Mr. Paulson was coming
back from his morning walk,

91
00:03:13,877 --> 00:03:16,139
and he tripped coming
up the steps in the lobby.

92
00:03:16,163 --> 00:03:19,898
I was almost able to catch
him, but I... I just missed.

93
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:22,867
And you are? Uh,
Vincent. I'm, uh...

94
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:26,004
I'm Mr. Paulson's doorman.

95
00:03:26,073 --> 00:03:28,153
Okay, well, let's
get him inside.

96
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:33,573
Kyle, good to see you again.

97
00:03:33,597 --> 00:03:35,058
Hey, nice to see you, too.

98
00:03:35,082 --> 00:03:36,860
Edwards, I thought
you were off today.

99
00:03:36,884 --> 00:03:38,678
Well, yeah, I was,
but... But I ruined it.

100
00:03:38,702 --> 00:03:41,519
She made me come
in. Probably the best call.

101
00:03:41,588 --> 00:03:43,508
Thanks, babe.

102
00:03:44,674 --> 00:03:45,924
Oh, okay.

103
00:03:45,992 --> 00:03:48,760
Well, let's, uh,
get to it. DeLuca.

104
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:50,923
Kyle Diaz, post-op DBS implant

105
00:03:50,947 --> 00:03:51,991
from about a month
and a half ago.

106
00:03:52,015 --> 00:03:53,398
He's developed another tremor...

107
00:03:53,467 --> 00:03:55,883
This time, in his left hand.
- Okay.

108
00:03:55,952 --> 00:03:58,854
We did DBS to treat
your right-hand tremor.

109
00:03:58,922 --> 00:04:00,602
I'm worried he's
developed a new lesion

110
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:02,423
on the other side of his brain.

111
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:04,470
Okay, Kyle, let's get
you changed into a gown.

112
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:05,861
We'll do a full work-up.

113
00:04:05,929 --> 00:04:08,697
DeLuca, let's do an
MRI, evoked potentials.

114
00:04:08,766 --> 00:04:10,365
Edwards, a word.

115
00:04:16,072 --> 00:04:18,773
I didn't realize you
two were a thing.

116
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:21,421
Oh, we're not. Not
a... Not a thing thing.

117
00:04:21,445 --> 00:04:23,177
It's new.

118
00:04:23,246 --> 00:04:26,025
Anyway, uh, I was thinking
we start with the MRI first,

119
00:04:26,049 --> 00:04:28,110
and then, if no acute
intervention is indicated,

120
00:04:28,134 --> 00:04:31,197
we can maybe just
adjust his meds. We can't.

121
00:04:31,221 --> 00:04:33,132
Yeah, we can. I looked it up.

122
00:04:33,156 --> 00:04:35,135
You are dating a patient.
You cannot treat him.

123
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:36,686
I told you we
barely have even...

124
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:38,905
Edwards, it is not a big deal.
You can keep him company.

125
00:04:38,929 --> 00:04:40,973
You're kicking me off his case?

126
00:04:40,997 --> 00:04:42,497
I am, yeah.

127
00:04:42,566 --> 00:04:43,909
So, I'm supposed to do what,

128
00:04:43,933 --> 00:04:45,428
just sit around and
hold his hand all day?

129
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:48,202
That is up to you.
It is your day off.

130
00:04:48,271 --> 00:04:49,688
Take it.

131
00:04:52,393 --> 00:04:54,559
Multiple stab wounds,
chest and abdomen.

132
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:56,139
Chest tubes placed
in trauma bay.

133
00:04:56,163 --> 00:04:58,330
Hemopericardium on ultrasound.

134
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:00,076
A mess, then. A mess.

135
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,861
All right, let's clean it up.

136
00:05:06,273 --> 00:05:07,939
Dr. Warren.

137
00:05:08,008 --> 00:05:09,675
Chief.

138
00:05:09,743 --> 00:05:12,422
I thought Dr. Knox
was... Dr. Knox is out sick.

139
00:05:12,446 --> 00:05:13,923
Warren, what the hell?

140
00:05:13,947 --> 00:05:15,925
I was an anesthesiologist
in a former life.

141
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:17,189
Hmm. Right on.

142
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:19,283
It's good to have you back, man.

143
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:22,320
I think.

144
00:05:25,392 --> 00:05:26,603
10 blade. 10 blade.

145
00:05:26,627 --> 00:05:28,860
Is something wrong?

146
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:30,145
Not on my end.

147
00:05:30,214 --> 00:05:31,480
Dr. Bailey?

148
00:05:32,782 --> 00:05:34,098
I didn't say a word.

149
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:40,321
Suction.

150
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:45,744
All right, here we go.

151
00:05:45,813 --> 00:05:48,913
Um, now that I have
both of you together,

152
00:05:48,982 --> 00:05:52,317
can I ask you,
um... I need a favor.

153
00:05:52,386 --> 00:05:54,185
Sure. Yeah.

154
00:05:54,254 --> 00:05:55,465
So, you know that Callie and I

155
00:05:55,489 --> 00:05:56,633
are going to court.

156
00:05:56,657 --> 00:05:57,823
Yeah?

157
00:05:58,659 --> 00:05:59,707
Blake.

158
00:05:59,777 --> 00:06:01,226
Do you need something?

159
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:03,211
Yes. Uh... You.

160
00:06:04,247 --> 00:06:05,663
I'm on your service today.

161
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:08,566
Um... Uh, really?

162
00:06:08,635 --> 00:06:10,713
Maybe I should talk to
somebody about switching that?

163
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:12,064
Yeah, I think that we should...

164
00:06:12,088 --> 00:06:14,422
You know what? Just
wait a second, okay?

165
00:06:14,491 --> 00:06:17,053
What were you
saying about the favor?

166
00:06:17,077 --> 00:06:19,588
Uh, nothing, nothing. Let's...
Let's take a look at this baby.

167
00:06:19,612 --> 00:06:21,395
Okay. Okay.

168
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:23,531
First things first...

169
00:06:23,599 --> 00:06:25,417
No obvious deformities.

170
00:06:25,486 --> 00:06:28,736
The length of the femur is
appropriate for gestational age,

171
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:30,800
and that is a perfect
and beautiful thing.

172
00:06:30,824 --> 00:06:32,156
So, that means...

173
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,508
No OI.

174
00:06:34,577 --> 00:06:37,678
No signs of
osteogenesis imperfecta.

175
00:06:38,866 --> 00:06:40,198
That is great news.

176
00:06:40,267 --> 00:06:42,111
It is. Ah, there we go.

177
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:43,852
We've got a strong
beating heart.

178
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,152
Look at that.

179
00:06:45,221 --> 00:06:46,621
It's beautiful.

180
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:49,858
Eight, nine, ten fingers.

181
00:06:51,094 --> 00:06:52,894
All right, let's
count those toes.

182
00:06:52,946 --> 00:06:55,741
Yeah, we got one,
two, three, four...

183
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:04,755
What just happened?

184
00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:06,024
Huh? What?

185
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:07,332
What did you just see?

186
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:10,362
Uh...

187
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,557
You stopped talking.

188
00:07:11,581 --> 00:07:13,559
Your mouth smiles, but
your eyes keep thinking.

189
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:14,994
It's that thing that
you do when...

190
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:16,913
April, I'm pretty sure
she's just smiling.

191
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:17,981
No, it's that thing you do
when you have bad news

192
00:07:18,005 --> 00:07:19,799
and you don't want to say it.

193
00:07:19,823 --> 00:07:21,673
What? What did you see?

194
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:23,901
It might be
nothing. It might be?

195
00:07:23,927 --> 00:07:25,710
Okay, so, it's not OI.

196
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:28,763
No, it's not OI. It's...
It's the baby's brain.

197
00:07:42,362 --> 00:07:44,612
Obvious contusion and
step-off in the lower thoracic.

198
00:07:44,681 --> 00:07:47,115
Easy. Dr. Grey, if it helps,

199
00:07:47,184 --> 00:07:48,795
uh, these are his medications

200
00:07:48,819 --> 00:07:50,463
and what paperwork I could find.

201
00:07:50,487 --> 00:07:51,997
Oh, thank you.
This is very helpful.

202
00:07:52,021 --> 00:07:53,132
Good. Thank you.

203
00:07:53,156 --> 00:07:54,205
Leo.

204
00:07:54,274 --> 00:07:56,524
Oh, Mrs. Paulson,
you got my message.

205
00:07:56,593 --> 00:08:00,045
Vincent, thank God you
were there. How is he?

206
00:08:00,113 --> 00:08:02,813
He is stable for now, and
I will keep you updated,

207
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:05,517
but I have to ask both of
you to step outside, please.

208
00:08:05,586 --> 00:08:06,586
Oh, uh...

209
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:08,881
Of course. Of course.

210
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:11,289
Wilson, would you
chart these for me?

211
00:08:11,358 --> 00:08:12,990
Great service. OWEN: Yeah.

212
00:08:15,362 --> 00:08:18,864
Your MRI results did
show an abnormality here,

213
00:08:19,867 --> 00:08:21,107
in the internal capsule.

214
00:08:21,151 --> 00:08:23,179
Whoa, can you,
uh, go back a slide?

215
00:08:23,203 --> 00:08:24,597
I need to take a look
at the basal ganglia.

216
00:08:24,621 --> 00:08:26,904
DeLuca, you're fine.

217
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:28,690
Wait. I need surgery again?

218
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:30,125
I thought you said

219
00:08:30,193 --> 00:08:31,637
they could just probably
change out my meds.

220
00:08:31,661 --> 00:08:32,727
I know.

221
00:08:32,796 --> 00:08:35,613
Why wouldn't meds
work in this case?

222
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:39,484
Uh, you see, the meds help
prevent the formation of new lesions.

223
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:41,052
Once you have the tremor,

224
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:44,739
you need a repeat DBS
implantation performed. Otherwise...

225
00:08:44,807 --> 00:08:47,403
Look, it's the same
surgery that you had before,

226
00:08:47,427 --> 00:08:49,138
just on the other
side of your brain.

227
00:08:49,162 --> 00:08:50,261
What she said.

228
00:08:51,498 --> 00:08:53,259
We can do the surgery today.

229
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:54,382
Whoa.

230
00:08:55,485 --> 00:08:56,784
Why the rush?

231
00:08:56,853 --> 00:08:58,419
Why wait?

232
00:08:58,488 --> 00:09:00,432
Well, Kyle's got three
more dates left on his tour.

233
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:03,152
He's worried he'll miss
them because of the surgery.

234
00:09:03,176 --> 00:09:05,943
Kyle, the tremor will
only continue to get worse

235
00:09:06,012 --> 00:09:07,846
if we don't treat it right away.

236
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:10,382
You can sit out one show
and play the other two.

237
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:14,352
I highly recommend surgery,
but, obviously, it is up to you.

238
00:09:23,079 --> 00:09:24,111
Yeah, let's do it.

239
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:28,282
Kyle?

240
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:31,652
What she said.

241
00:09:40,397 --> 00:09:42,763
Hey.

242
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:45,328
Spinal fracture? Hey.
T-10. Are you available?

243
00:09:45,352 --> 00:09:47,330
Yeah. No, that's not too bad.

244
00:09:47,354 --> 00:09:50,221
Yeah, I can do a spinal
fusion with a bone graft.

245
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:51,617
Meredith, can I
ask you something?

246
00:09:51,641 --> 00:09:52,924
Sure.

247
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:54,242
Okay, um...

248
00:09:54,311 --> 00:09:56,311
Are these Leo's scans? Yeah.

249
00:09:56,379 --> 00:09:58,980
Yeah, we're just
discussing the, uh, surgical...

250
00:09:59,049 --> 00:10:00,827
You know this morning...

251
00:10:00,851 --> 00:10:02,433
I saw Owen's junk.

252
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:05,915
It was untucked. Meredith.

253
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:08,205
No. Where? In the living room.

254
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:10,053
He was hanging out with Amelia.

255
00:10:10,077 --> 00:10:12,288
Can we not, please? It's fine.

256
00:10:12,312 --> 00:10:14,590
You should just take
it upstairs next time.

257
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,030
There won't be a next time.

258
00:10:16,099 --> 00:10:18,210
If I know Amelia, it won't
happen again until it does.

259
00:10:18,234 --> 00:10:20,634
I can't listen to you two.

260
00:10:20,704 --> 00:10:21,869
I'll go update Leo.

261
00:10:21,938 --> 00:10:23,337
Yeah.

262
00:10:23,406 --> 00:10:25,256
Hey, did you want
to ask me something?

263
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:27,158
Uh...

264
00:10:27,226 --> 00:10:28,793
Nothing. Just never mind.

265
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:30,361
Okay. Yeah.

266
00:10:32,181 --> 00:10:34,482
Closing the septal defect.

267
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:35,791
Teflon pledgets.

268
00:10:35,819 --> 00:10:37,969
Second unit's going in.

269
00:10:43,043 --> 00:10:44,408
We took little Tuck

270
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,561
to the amusement
park a few months ago.

271
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:48,023
Oh, the new one over on, um...

272
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:49,814
Yeah, I need more suction here.

273
00:10:49,883 --> 00:10:51,415
Poor thing.

274
00:10:51,485 --> 00:10:54,235
He didn't meet the height
requirement on one of the rides.

275
00:10:54,304 --> 00:10:56,354
Know what he did?

276
00:10:56,423 --> 00:10:59,474
He tried to scam
the ticket taker.

277
00:10:59,543 --> 00:11:00,892
He didn't scam anybody.

278
00:11:00,944 --> 00:11:03,477
Little scammer.

279
00:11:03,546 --> 00:11:07,548
Wanted to stuff his
shoes with his socks...

280
00:11:08,151 --> 00:11:09,450
Here, retract.

281
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:10,952
Make himself taller.

282
00:11:11,021 --> 00:11:12,265
Because he was really passionate

283
00:11:12,289 --> 00:11:13,432
about that new roller coaster.

284
00:11:13,456 --> 00:11:14,989
Too bad. He was too short.

285
00:11:15,058 --> 00:11:16,106
3-0 Prolene.

286
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:17,653
Less than one inch.

287
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:21,412
One inch is all he needs
to go flying out of his seat,

288
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,281
to smash onto the
pavement like a cantaloupe.

289
00:11:24,784 --> 00:11:25,850
Suction.

290
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:27,785
Rules are in place for a reason.

291
00:11:27,837 --> 00:11:29,882
Sometimes rules
can be excessive.

292
00:11:29,906 --> 00:11:30,988
Necessary.

293
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:32,057
Overkill.

294
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,988
Must have been
tough on little Tuck.

295
00:11:36,012 --> 00:11:38,413
Oh, Tuck had a fit. Wonder
where he learned that.

296
00:11:38,481 --> 00:11:39,880
Really? Really?

297
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:40,881
Are we really trying to
make this comparison?

298
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,384
If the sneaker fits. Suture.

299
00:11:45,855 --> 00:11:48,317
The ventricles in the baby's
brain are slightly dilated.

300
00:11:48,341 --> 00:11:49,541
It's hard to tell.

301
00:11:49,609 --> 00:11:51,049
It's really hard to tell.

302
00:11:51,111 --> 00:11:52,977
Well, so, that means...
What does that mean?

303
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:54,924
It could be a positional
glitch in the ultrasound,

304
00:11:54,948 --> 00:11:57,282
so let's... Or it
could be an infection,

305
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:59,517
CMV or varicella.

306
00:11:59,586 --> 00:12:02,387
Unlikely, but, yes.

307
00:12:02,456 --> 00:12:03,799
You know what? Let's just...

308
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:07,292
What... What else?
What else could it be?

309
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,711
Uh, neural-tube defects or
a chromosomal abnormality.

310
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:12,797
This is not happening.

311
00:12:12,866 --> 00:12:15,011
I don't believe this.
This is not happening.

312
00:12:15,035 --> 00:12:18,636
Hey, listen, I'm not
sure if this is happening,

313
00:12:18,705 --> 00:12:20,638
so let's just play it safe.

314
00:12:20,707 --> 00:12:22,518
And let's do a full work-up,

315
00:12:22,542 --> 00:12:24,087
and we're gonna get a bigger
picture and we'll be able to say.

316
00:12:24,111 --> 00:12:25,893
How did you miss this?

317
00:12:25,962 --> 00:12:28,696
You said... You said
that everything was fine.

318
00:12:28,764 --> 00:12:31,031
Weeks ago, you
did an ultrasound,

319
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,934
you looked at it, and you
said, "That is a healthy baby."

320
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:36,003
I know, and... You
said we were fine.

321
00:12:36,072 --> 00:12:39,290
So, did you not look closely
enough? What... What...

322
00:12:39,358 --> 00:12:41,270
Hey, let's be calm.
You said we were fine.

323
00:12:41,294 --> 00:12:43,389
And now you're... Let's
just... Can we calm down?

324
00:12:43,413 --> 00:12:45,145
Calm? Okay, you know what?

325
00:12:45,214 --> 00:12:48,315
I held my baby, and I
watched him die last time.

326
00:12:48,385 --> 00:12:50,065
Forgive me if I'm not calm.

327
00:12:51,087 --> 00:12:52,720
Of course.

328
00:12:52,788 --> 00:12:54,600
Look, um... I just...
I just... I meant...

329
00:12:54,624 --> 00:12:57,975
Can you just leave right
now? I'm sorry. Just...

330
00:12:58,044 --> 00:13:00,411
Can you leave now, please?

331
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:17,095
Can I do anything?

332
00:13:17,163 --> 00:13:19,041
Check your post-ops? No.

333
00:13:19,065 --> 00:13:20,509
Should I just find
another service?

334
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:21,882
No, no. I don't have time.

335
00:13:21,951 --> 00:13:24,085
I don't have time to
find someone else.

336
00:13:24,154 --> 00:13:26,165
All right, um, you know
what you can do is,

337
00:13:26,189 --> 00:13:27,900
April Kepner. You can run
a complete blood serology,

338
00:13:27,924 --> 00:13:30,275
Karyotyping, IgG, IgM levels.

339
00:13:30,343 --> 00:13:31,737
I want to check for everything.

340
00:13:31,761 --> 00:13:33,005
See if anything was missed?

341
00:13:33,029 --> 00:13:34,891
I want to know if this
baby has a hangnail.

342
00:13:34,915 --> 00:13:36,331
Can you do that?

343
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:37,699
I can.

344
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:42,320
Nice. Your bilirubin is down.

345
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:44,428
You're ready to go, champ.

346
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:46,757
Hey, I need your help.

347
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,092
Good morning.

348
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:50,561
As a friend... And a doctor,

349
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:53,797
and a peds doctor,
but more as a friend.

350
00:13:53,867 --> 00:13:55,878
Uh, whichever. What?

351
00:13:55,902 --> 00:13:58,202
Um, well...

352
00:13:58,271 --> 00:14:00,637
It's, uh... It's a
big... It's a big ask.

353
00:14:00,706 --> 00:14:03,707
And, uh... I wouldn't
ask, but I need someone

354
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:05,642
who knows me and my kid...

355
00:14:05,711 --> 00:14:09,013
Someone who people trust
with kids, and you're the...

356
00:14:09,082 --> 00:14:11,159
Well, you've known me
for the long... Callie, just...

357
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:13,417
No, wait, hold on. I...

358
00:14:13,469 --> 00:14:16,387
Okay, I also know

359
00:14:16,456 --> 00:14:18,634
that you have a
relationship with Arizona

360
00:14:18,658 --> 00:14:20,108
and you're very...

361
00:14:20,176 --> 00:14:22,455
Are you asking me to
take the stand for you

362
00:14:22,479 --> 00:14:23,622
for your custody thing?

363
00:14:23,646 --> 00:14:25,846
Oh, God, yeah. Thank you.

364
00:14:25,915 --> 00:14:27,214
'Cause it's a no.

365
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:29,684
I like you both. I'm
not picking sides.

366
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,308
Kyle, we've scheduled you
for surgery this afternoon.

367
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:40,178
Dr. DeLuca is just
gonna draw some blood.

368
00:14:40,247 --> 00:14:42,446
Okay, and then?

369
00:14:42,515 --> 00:14:43,831
Moving forward?

370
00:14:43,899 --> 00:14:47,000
Steph said something
about a... A trial?

371
00:14:47,069 --> 00:14:48,886
The monoclonal antibody trial.

372
00:14:48,955 --> 00:14:50,854
I did a little research
while we were waiting,

373
00:14:50,924 --> 00:14:52,818
and they are experimenting
with MS. regression.

374
00:14:52,842 --> 00:14:54,375
Huh.

375
00:14:54,444 --> 00:14:56,164
Maybe, something to look into.

376
00:14:56,196 --> 00:14:58,045
I think it would be a
very good fit for Kyle.

377
00:14:58,114 --> 00:14:59,447
Down the line.

378
00:14:59,515 --> 00:15:02,210
Right now, we need to focus
on getting you ready for surgery,

379
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:03,545
so I will see you soon.

380
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:04,902
DeLuca.

381
00:15:04,971 --> 00:15:06,682
Right, um, I'm gonna
need your right arm.

382
00:15:06,706 --> 00:15:07,972
I got it.

383
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:14,412
You scared me to death.

384
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:17,114
I know.

385
00:15:18,551 --> 00:15:20,985
And Angelica?

386
00:15:21,053 --> 00:15:22,520
Is she here?

387
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:25,823
She's getting a cup of coffee.

388
00:15:25,892 --> 00:15:29,227
I'd like to stay if
you don't mind.

389
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:31,478
Please. Stay.

390
00:15:45,912 --> 00:15:47,528
Excuse me? Mr. Paulson.

391
00:15:47,596 --> 00:15:49,930
I was just coming to
talk you through pre-op.

392
00:15:49,999 --> 00:15:51,432
How are you feeling, sir?

393
00:15:51,501 --> 00:15:54,402
I'm here. I'm here.

394
00:15:54,471 --> 00:15:57,855
I had to call the
kids and the grands.

395
00:15:57,907 --> 00:16:00,173
Everyone was so worried.

396
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:07,393
Hold the door! Can
you hold the door?

397
00:16:07,417 --> 00:16:08,727
Are my labs back yet?

398
00:16:08,751 --> 00:16:10,150
Hey. Um, no, not yet.

399
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:12,531
I put a rush on them, but I really
think they're gonna be normal.

400
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:14,033
Yeah, but they'll
be inconclusive.

401
00:16:14,057 --> 00:16:16,573
Yeah, but, you know,
I... Then, I'll just...

402
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,809
I'll do a repeat ultrasound
in two weeks to see...

403
00:16:18,878 --> 00:16:20,944
Two weeks? I can't
wait two weeks.

404
00:16:21,014 --> 00:16:23,058
We might be able
to do something.

405
00:16:23,082 --> 00:16:25,227
I know that you're
worried, but I really...

406
00:16:25,251 --> 00:16:27,418
Look, what about a fetal MRI

407
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:29,347
to get a better look
at the baby's brain?

408
00:16:29,371 --> 00:16:30,949
To get a clear image,
I'd have to put you

409
00:16:30,973 --> 00:16:32,284
and the baby under
general anesthesia,

410
00:16:32,308 --> 00:16:35,075
and I don't want to do
that unless I have to.

411
00:16:35,144 --> 00:16:36,677
Neither do you.

412
00:16:38,098 --> 00:16:39,763
Look, you need to trust me.

413
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:42,700
I know that I've tested
your trust before,

414
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:44,284
but you need to trust me.

415
00:16:46,489 --> 00:16:48,989
I trusted you to catch this.

416
00:16:57,967 --> 00:17:00,929
So, here's some more info on
the monoclonal antibody trial.

417
00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:03,755
Edwards, maybe you
didn't hear me this morning

418
00:17:03,823 --> 00:17:05,600
when I said you
are off this case.

419
00:17:05,624 --> 00:17:07,258
I am not asking to operate.

420
00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:09,977
I just figured I could sit
with him like last time.

421
00:17:10,045 --> 00:17:11,723
Last time, you were
in there as his doctor,

422
00:17:11,747 --> 00:17:13,130
not as his girlfriend.

423
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,798
I'm not his...

424
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:18,435
He is scared, and I
can keep him calm.

425
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:20,282
I can handle it.
DeLuca, shut it.

426
00:17:20,306 --> 00:17:22,851
Uh, DeLuca, would you
take this up to the OR, please?

427
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,041
Sure.

428
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:30,676
Look, I get it. Yeah?

429
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:33,044
You have feelings for this
guy, and I am not judging.

430
00:17:33,068 --> 00:17:35,068
Well, kind of
sounds like you are.

431
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:36,670
I can be impartial. I'm...

432
00:17:36,739 --> 00:17:39,852
Oh, Edwards, you have been
the family member from hell today.

433
00:17:39,876 --> 00:17:42,271
This is why we don't
doctor the people we love.

434
00:17:42,295 --> 00:17:45,874
You are pitching treatments.
You are second-guessing me.

435
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:48,149
I cannot help that I
have knowledge that...

436
00:17:48,217 --> 00:17:50,696
And I am not gonna risk
you doing that in my OR

437
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,447
when I am inside his brain.

438
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:54,805
Fine. I'll sit in
the gallery. It's...

439
00:17:54,874 --> 00:17:56,573
No family in the gallery.

440
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:59,326
We slept together
a couple of times!

441
00:17:59,395 --> 00:18:01,106
Good enough. Here is
what is gonna happen.

442
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:02,975
You are gonna hand
me your access badge.

443
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:05,265
You will walk
Kyle to the red line

444
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:09,270
and go sit in the waiting
room until he is out of surgery

445
00:18:09,339 --> 00:18:10,966
like any other loved one

446
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:13,018
because today you
are not a surgeon.

447
00:18:13,042 --> 00:18:14,542
Are we clear?

448
00:18:18,214 --> 00:18:19,496
You're kidding, right?

449
00:18:19,949 --> 00:18:21,232
Badge.

450
00:18:22,552 --> 00:18:23,717
Now.

451
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:42,119
<i>Get a chance to look at her?</i>

452
00:18:42,188 --> 00:18:44,638
I know what you think you saw.

453
00:18:47,677 --> 00:18:48,804
Mr. Paulson...

454
00:18:48,828 --> 00:18:50,043
Nothing happened.

455
00:18:52,315 --> 00:18:55,032
I have never cheated on my wife.

456
00:18:56,318 --> 00:18:59,252
Vincent and I, we're not...

457
00:19:01,023 --> 00:19:04,224
I have been married 51 years.

458
00:19:04,293 --> 00:19:07,578
I have three kids,
seven grandchildren,

459
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,213
and another one on the way,

460
00:19:09,282 --> 00:19:12,049
and my wife is happy.

461
00:19:12,118 --> 00:19:13,985
She loves me.

462
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:20,424
But my feelings for Vincent...

463
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:27,597
I would destroy my
wife. And I won't do that.

464
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:28,816
So, please...

465
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:31,968
I didn't see a thing.

466
00:19:35,408 --> 00:19:38,475
You know, I saw the doorman
waiting at the waiting room.

467
00:19:38,545 --> 00:19:39,588
That is dedication.

468
00:19:39,612 --> 00:19:41,027
Wow.

469
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:42,576
Leo must be one
hell of a good tipper.

470
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:45,315
They're in love.

471
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:46,612
What, Leo and the doorman?

472
00:19:46,636 --> 00:19:48,302
Avitene.

473
00:19:49,589 --> 00:19:51,489
I caught them.

474
00:19:51,558 --> 00:19:53,007
That's awesome.

475
00:19:53,076 --> 00:19:54,870
Like, caught them caught them?

476
00:19:54,894 --> 00:19:56,934
Just holding hands, very PG.

477
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:59,045
Nothing like what
I saw this morning.

478
00:20:00,483 --> 00:20:02,111
They're in love. That's sweet.

479
00:20:02,135 --> 00:20:03,312
It's sad.

480
00:20:03,336 --> 00:20:05,802
They have love
right in front of them.

481
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:08,717
That doorman is just gonna
keep opening that door,

482
00:20:08,741 --> 00:20:12,543
letting love out and
letting it back in again

483
00:20:12,612 --> 00:20:15,052
and then letting it
walk right by him.

484
00:20:16,732 --> 00:20:17,732
Hmm.

485
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,950
15 blade.

486
00:20:20,019 --> 00:20:22,379
You know, that is sad.

487
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:25,872
Hmm.

488
00:20:26,842 --> 00:20:29,476
And when Dr. Warren accuses me

489
00:20:29,545 --> 00:20:32,078
of trying to sabotage
his surgical career,

490
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:34,014
would you say that's
a fair assessment?

491
00:20:34,082 --> 00:20:37,484
No. You haven't tried to
sabotage anything. Irrigation.

492
00:20:37,553 --> 00:20:39,197
Of course she's
gonna agree with you.

493
00:20:39,221 --> 00:20:40,504
You're the Chief.

494
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:42,784
And a fair one. My
doctors can speak freely.

495
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:44,124
But not your husband.

496
00:20:44,193 --> 00:20:45,693
I'm ready to close.

497
00:20:45,762 --> 00:20:46,939
You got something
to say, say it.

498
00:20:46,963 --> 00:20:48,641
I have been. For weeks!

499
00:20:48,665 --> 00:20:50,948
And doing whatever
you want to do, too,

500
00:20:51,017 --> 00:20:52,783
with no care that your presence

501
00:20:52,852 --> 00:20:54,802
in the OR is stressing
out my surgeons.

502
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:56,430
Isn't that right, Dr. Riggs?

503
00:20:56,489 --> 00:20:59,268
Um, well, I don't really
have a dog in the race.

504
00:20:59,292 --> 00:21:01,108
You hear that, Dr. Warren?

505
00:21:01,177 --> 00:21:03,127
Unnecessary levels of stress.

506
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:06,063
And Dr. Riggs operated with
bombs dropping on his head.

507
00:21:06,132 --> 00:21:07,612
Okay, okay, see,
here's the problem...

508
00:21:09,986 --> 00:21:11,730
- Multifocal PVCs.
- Air embolism.

509
00:21:11,754 --> 00:21:13,215
Must have sucked
air in the septal wound.

510
00:21:13,239 --> 00:21:14,959
Get your hands out! Out now!

511
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,928
Riggs, he's gonna
need a needle aspiration

512
00:21:20,997 --> 00:21:22,696
through the ventricle

513
00:21:22,765 --> 00:21:23,809
before he throws an air
embolus and strokes out.

514
00:21:23,833 --> 00:21:25,716
Already on it.

515
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:34,041
No air on the
TEE. You got it all.

516
00:21:35,744 --> 00:21:39,058
Oh, uh, I was about to make a
point about your questions, Chief.

517
00:21:39,082 --> 00:21:41,148
You see, these two, no offense,

518
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:43,244
but they're gonna
say whatever you want,

519
00:21:43,268 --> 00:21:46,537
'cause Pierce works for you,
and Riggs works for Pierce.

520
00:21:46,605 --> 00:21:48,367
So you can ask them all you want

521
00:21:48,391 --> 00:21:50,168
and you can compare
me to a child all you want,

522
00:21:50,192 --> 00:21:52,070
but the fact is you
are never gonna know

523
00:21:52,094 --> 00:21:55,146
what they really think,
because unlike me,

524
00:21:56,282 --> 00:21:59,082
they're beholden to you.

525
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:02,519
Now, I'm good back here
if you all care to continue.

526
00:22:05,525 --> 00:22:06,857
You are so arrogant.

527
00:22:10,379 --> 00:22:11,645
Huh? Callie asked you?

528
00:22:11,714 --> 00:22:12,954
Yeah, and I said no.

529
00:22:13,015 --> 00:22:14,682
And you're saying no to me?

530
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,600
Alex, we're friends.

531
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:18,068
Callie's my friend, too.

532
00:22:18,137 --> 00:22:19,436
No, I know. Come on.

533
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:21,889
Dr. Robbins?

534
00:22:21,957 --> 00:22:24,625
Blake, what do you want?

535
00:22:24,693 --> 00:22:26,026
I just got the labs.

536
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:27,361
You are everywhere.

537
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:28,562
She is everywhere.

538
00:22:28,631 --> 00:22:30,730
It's like she's
a spy for Callie.

539
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:32,816
Listen... What?

540
00:22:32,885 --> 00:22:34,385
Did you hear enough?

541
00:22:34,454 --> 00:22:36,481
Do you want us just to
go over anything for you

542
00:22:36,505 --> 00:22:38,483
so that you can report
back that I'm incompetent

543
00:22:38,507 --> 00:22:41,859
and that I miss things as
a doctor and as a mother?

544
00:22:41,928 --> 00:22:43,539
I mean, what else? What
else? You know what?

545
00:22:43,563 --> 00:22:45,223
Hey, do they know
about the fake leg?

546
00:22:45,247 --> 00:22:46,725
'Cause I'm definitely not
the best runner in a crisis.

547
00:22:46,749 --> 00:22:48,893
So why don't you go back
and report that to them

548
00:22:48,917 --> 00:22:50,217
and just back off of me!

549
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:51,801
Just back off!

550
00:23:03,732 --> 00:23:05,511
So, I'm gonna have
to look at the pretty boy

551
00:23:05,535 --> 00:23:06,645
instead of you this time?

552
00:23:06,669 --> 00:23:07,812
You know I'm right here, right?

553
00:23:07,836 --> 00:23:09,881
Relax. He called you pretty.

554
00:23:09,905 --> 00:23:12,265
Kyle, this is your stop.

555
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:23,934
Hey.

556
00:23:24,002 --> 00:23:25,135
Yeah.

557
00:23:26,622 --> 00:23:28,338
Come here.

558
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:30,507
You have something
over here. Come here.

559
00:23:37,033 --> 00:23:39,113
I'll see you after, okay?

560
00:23:40,703 --> 00:23:42,002
See you after.

561
00:24:14,904 --> 00:24:16,036
Husband?

562
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:18,989
I'm sorry?

563
00:24:19,057 --> 00:24:21,425
Are you waiting
for your husband?

564
00:24:21,494 --> 00:24:25,195
Or... Sorry, I didn't
mean to presume.

565
00:24:25,264 --> 00:24:27,214
Family member?

566
00:24:27,282 --> 00:24:29,316
Uh, my, uh...

567
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:32,186
Boyfriend. I guess. Mmm.

568
00:24:32,254 --> 00:24:33,504
I don't know what he is.

569
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:36,690
Ah, yes, well...

570
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:41,795
I certainly understand that.

571
00:24:45,351 --> 00:24:46,761
I shouldn't even
be sitting here.

572
00:24:49,421 --> 00:24:51,301
I shouldn't, either. Um...

573
00:24:52,525 --> 00:24:54,224
Uh...

574
00:24:54,293 --> 00:24:56,977
I'm gonna get myself some tea.

575
00:24:57,046 --> 00:24:58,845
It helps to calm me.

576
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:00,814
Uh, may I bring you a cup?

577
00:25:00,883 --> 00:25:02,182
Oh, no.

578
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,218
Well...

579
00:25:07,056 --> 00:25:09,340
Yes. Thank you.

580
00:25:10,108 --> 00:25:11,625
All right. Good.

581
00:25:22,537 --> 00:25:24,897
I'll see you tomorrow.

582
00:25:37,436 --> 00:25:38,516
Thank you.

583
00:25:38,571 --> 00:25:41,271
It's just... Oh...

584
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:43,051
I just want to lie down.

585
00:25:43,075 --> 00:25:46,054
I should, because I'm
gonna lose this case.

586
00:25:46,078 --> 00:25:48,473
I am putting up a losing fight

587
00:25:48,497 --> 00:25:50,297
that's just gonna...

588
00:25:50,366 --> 00:25:52,260
It's just gonna hurt Sofia.

589
00:25:52,284 --> 00:25:53,795
And it's gonna end up with me

590
00:25:53,819 --> 00:25:56,464
losing my little girl anyway

591
00:25:56,488 --> 00:25:58,055
because that woman

592
00:25:58,124 --> 00:26:00,858
is watching me
be a terrible doctor

593
00:26:00,926 --> 00:26:03,794
and a terrible mother,

594
00:26:03,863 --> 00:26:06,029
which, maybe, I am.

595
00:26:06,098 --> 00:26:08,565
Today, I feel like both.

596
00:26:10,286 --> 00:26:11,785
If you want your daughter,

597
00:26:11,854 --> 00:26:14,821
you're gonna have to fight
like you've never fought.

598
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:17,157
And you have to
stand up for yourself

599
00:26:17,226 --> 00:26:19,676
and believe you deserve it.

600
00:26:19,745 --> 00:26:22,379
You want to lie down?

601
00:26:22,448 --> 00:26:24,414
You don't get to.

602
00:26:26,785 --> 00:26:28,302
And I'll see you inside.

603
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:43,734
How many times
have you done that?

604
00:26:43,803 --> 00:26:45,702
Uh, once...

605
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:47,470
Counting today.

606
00:26:48,707 --> 00:26:50,907
Bailey was right.

607
00:26:50,976 --> 00:26:52,843
You are arrogant.

608
00:26:52,911 --> 00:26:56,113
I'm sorry? The
patient was dying.

609
00:26:56,181 --> 00:26:58,015
I wouldn't be pulling
any cowboy moves

610
00:26:58,083 --> 00:26:59,883
in front of the Chief right now.

611
00:26:59,952 --> 00:27:01,863
Look, I was doing my job.

612
00:27:01,887 --> 00:27:04,099
Miranda has to
accept that I can work

613
00:27:04,123 --> 00:27:07,858
and be in an OR and
learn at the same time.

614
00:27:07,926 --> 00:27:10,127
If Bailey really didn't
want you working here,

615
00:27:10,195 --> 00:27:11,879
you would be long gone.

616
00:27:11,947 --> 00:27:15,382
She could shut you out,
freeze you out, kick you out.

617
00:27:15,451 --> 00:27:16,950
She is the Chief of Surgery.

618
00:27:17,018 --> 00:27:19,119
She has all the power.

619
00:27:19,187 --> 00:27:20,503
But she didn't.

620
00:27:22,991 --> 00:27:26,126
You did something wrong.
You got punished for it.

621
00:27:26,195 --> 00:27:28,345
You didn't like it, so
you went around it.

622
00:27:28,413 --> 00:27:30,430
The only reason you
were able to do that

623
00:27:30,498 --> 00:27:31,648
is 'cause she's your wife.

624
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:44,544
Yeah, uh, page me if
the post-op scan shows

625
00:27:44,613 --> 00:27:47,013
any evidence of air embolus.

626
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:48,481
Right.

627
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:50,183
Chief?

628
00:27:50,252 --> 00:27:53,437
I know you're my boss
and my boss's boss,

629
00:27:54,206 --> 00:27:55,939
but speaking freely...

630
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:58,603
Well, you're not Warren's
boss, not right now.

631
00:27:58,627 --> 00:28:02,262
And you don't have to
like that he's working here,

632
00:28:02,331 --> 00:28:03,859
but it's what he needs to do.

633
00:28:05,317 --> 00:28:07,395
I mean, we were
residents, right?

634
00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:09,197
The good ones,
the ones who love it.

635
00:28:09,221 --> 00:28:11,833
And we learned where
we could, when we could,

636
00:28:11,857 --> 00:28:14,058
and as much as we could.

637
00:28:14,126 --> 00:28:18,027
And I think Warren
is just doing that.

638
00:28:18,096 --> 00:28:20,630
I'm not sure you can stop it.

639
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:21,939
And, um...

640
00:28:23,068 --> 00:28:25,188
I'm not sure you should.

641
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:27,971
Good night.

642
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:38,581
April, you really want an MRI?

643
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:42,052
You want me to put you and your
baby under general anesthesia?

644
00:28:42,121 --> 00:28:44,288
I want to know.

645
00:28:44,356 --> 00:28:46,456
Come with me.

646
00:29:13,085 --> 00:29:15,301
Okay, Stephanie,
Kyle is out of surgery.

647
00:29:15,371 --> 00:29:16,836
It is "Dr. Edwards."

648
00:29:16,905 --> 00:29:18,705
Yeah, you know what?

649
00:29:18,774 --> 00:29:21,140
The loved ones, we like
to use the first-name basis.

650
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:23,087
You shut up. I taught you that.

651
00:29:23,111 --> 00:29:24,939
Okay, well, the surgery
went as planned.

652
00:29:24,963 --> 00:29:27,603
I know. Or Dr. Shepherd
would be here.

653
00:29:27,633 --> 00:29:29,411
We always send the B team
when the surgery goes well.

654
00:29:29,435 --> 00:29:30,745
Can I see your tablet, please?

655
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:33,503
Mmm, can't. It's HIPAA
rules and Shepherd's orders.

656
00:29:36,958 --> 00:29:38,798
I'll let you know
when you can see him.

657
00:29:41,397 --> 00:29:45,783
I'm glad everything
went well with your, uh...

658
00:29:45,851 --> 00:29:47,091
Whatever he is.

659
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:49,085
Thanks.

660
00:29:49,154 --> 00:29:51,454
I, uh... I hope it
goes well with yours.

661
00:29:52,774 --> 00:29:54,024
Thank you.

662
00:29:57,496 --> 00:29:59,429
Hold here, Wilson. Right here.

663
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:01,965
Is that enough exposure?

664
00:30:02,034 --> 00:30:05,002
No, I need more retraction,
please, right there... That.

665
00:30:07,356 --> 00:30:08,616
I'm not gonna be a doorman.

666
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,772
Good.

667
00:30:09,841 --> 00:30:11,386
Yeah, I mean, that
would be a step down.

668
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:13,877
No, no, I'm...

669
00:30:13,946 --> 00:30:15,223
I'm choosing the life I want.

670
00:30:15,247 --> 00:30:17,096
That's why I'm
moving to New York.

671
00:30:17,165 --> 00:30:20,300
And the life that I want has
Penny and Sofia in it and...

672
00:30:20,368 --> 00:30:23,503
Um, I need your help.

673
00:30:23,572 --> 00:30:28,058
My custody trial is starting
soon, and I'm wondering if...

674
00:30:28,127 --> 00:30:30,761
We'll testify in court for you?

675
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:33,069
You know what?
Just think about it.

676
00:30:33,115 --> 00:30:35,293
Absolutely, Callie.
Yes, of course.

677
00:30:35,317 --> 00:30:37,462
No, 'cause I know that you
and Arizona are friends, too,

678
00:30:37,486 --> 00:30:38,869
and so I'm just...

679
00:30:38,938 --> 00:30:40,270
Callie, absolutely.

680
00:30:42,107 --> 00:30:43,356
Dr. Torres?

681
00:30:43,425 --> 00:30:44,591
Yeah.

682
00:30:45,728 --> 00:30:47,160
Oh, God.

683
00:30:47,229 --> 00:30:48,595
What?

684
00:30:51,416 --> 00:30:53,634
Oh.

685
00:30:53,702 --> 00:30:55,668
No wonder why the spine snapped.

686
00:30:55,754 --> 00:30:57,187
Thank you.

687
00:31:02,995 --> 00:31:05,696
There's nothing you can do?

688
00:31:05,764 --> 00:31:08,765
Your cancer is inoperable.

689
00:31:08,834 --> 00:31:12,314
It's metastasized to
your bones and your liver.

690
00:31:12,354 --> 00:31:13,987
How long until...

691
00:31:14,072 --> 00:31:17,424
Six months, maybe a year.

692
00:31:17,492 --> 00:31:19,932
Would you like me
to call your wife?

693
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:22,712
Is Vincent still here?

694
00:31:23,532 --> 00:31:24,814
He hasn't left.

695
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:32,689
The first time I saw Vincent

696
00:31:32,758 --> 00:31:35,993
my heart jumped out of my chest.

697
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:40,964
I thought I was
having a heart attack.

698
00:31:42,467 --> 00:31:45,268
It was butterflies.

699
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:52,008
And when I came to know
he felt the same way...

700
00:31:54,713 --> 00:31:57,129
I smiled for weeks.

701
00:32:03,037 --> 00:32:05,071
I love my wife.

702
00:32:06,808 --> 00:32:08,908
But...

703
00:32:08,977 --> 00:32:11,645
This is... This was different.

704
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,050
We've spent

705
00:32:17,119 --> 00:32:19,685
15 years doing this.

706
00:32:21,289 --> 00:32:23,789
Talking at his desk...

707
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,927
Passing by each other.

708
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:32,899
15 years.

709
00:32:33,686 --> 00:32:35,702
You have one more.

710
00:32:41,577 --> 00:32:43,760
You're awake.

711
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:47,547
Are you all right?

712
00:32:47,615 --> 00:32:49,416
I'm...

713
00:32:50,118 --> 00:32:52,185
Yes.

714
00:32:52,254 --> 00:32:54,120
We got to talk.

715
00:32:57,609 --> 00:32:58,809
Vincent.

716
00:33:01,914 --> 00:33:04,664
He refused to leave

717
00:33:04,733 --> 00:33:08,435
until he knew you
were out of surgery.

718
00:33:08,503 --> 00:33:10,320
Wasn't that nice?

719
00:33:10,389 --> 00:33:12,555
It was my pleasure.

720
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:17,260
You've always
been too good to me.

721
00:33:19,097 --> 00:33:21,148
Thank you for everything.

722
00:33:26,538 --> 00:33:28,354
But you can go now.

723
00:33:33,078 --> 00:33:35,345
We've kept you long enough.

724
00:33:42,154 --> 00:33:43,653
I don't know

725
00:33:43,722 --> 00:33:47,090
what we would do
without you, dear.

726
00:34:16,254 --> 00:34:17,520
Okay, so, here,

727
00:34:17,589 --> 00:34:20,790
the baby's brain
ventricular diameter is 10.1,

728
00:34:20,859 --> 00:34:22,893
but here is a much
clearer picture.

729
00:34:22,961 --> 00:34:25,778
So, it's nothing? It's
definitively nothing.

730
00:34:25,847 --> 00:34:29,766
A false positive on the
ultrasound, a glitch, just like I said.

731
00:34:29,835 --> 00:34:30,879
Thank you, God.

732
00:34:30,903 --> 00:34:32,402
Oh, thank you.

733
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:33,720
God.

734
00:34:33,788 --> 00:34:36,556
Thank you so much
for doing the MRI.

735
00:34:36,625 --> 00:34:37,702
I know that you
weren't crazy about it,

736
00:34:37,726 --> 00:34:40,059
but I... I needed this.

737
00:34:40,128 --> 00:34:43,980
And I know I was... I
went a little crazy today,

738
00:34:44,049 --> 00:34:46,015
and I just... I
got really scared.

739
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:47,951
I needed to know. Um...

740
00:34:49,721 --> 00:34:51,254
This is a list

741
00:34:51,323 --> 00:34:54,123
of the very, very, very
best OBs that I know.

742
00:34:54,192 --> 00:34:56,843
What? What do you mean?

743
00:34:56,912 --> 00:34:59,245
Because I can't be your doctor.

744
00:35:01,049 --> 00:35:04,195
Wait, listen...
Listen, I'm... I'm sorry.

745
00:35:04,219 --> 00:35:06,436
I just needed to know for sure.

746
00:35:06,505 --> 00:35:08,800
If I'm gonna be your doctor,
then I can't be your friend.

747
00:35:08,824 --> 00:35:10,267
And... No, come on.

748
00:35:10,291 --> 00:35:11,874
And I want to be your friend.

749
00:35:16,348 --> 00:35:17,413
I'm sorry.

750
00:36:02,778 --> 00:36:03,818
Oh.

751
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:08,514
You just getting started?

752
00:36:08,584 --> 00:36:10,951
Something like that. Ugh.

753
00:36:11,019 --> 00:36:12,986
I had the saddest day.

754
00:36:13,055 --> 00:36:17,156
Two old men, impossible
love... The worst.

755
00:36:17,225 --> 00:36:19,659
I just want to go home
and crawl into bed.

756
00:36:19,728 --> 00:36:21,110
Then go.

757
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:22,780
Wow.

758
00:36:24,315 --> 00:36:26,148
Are you okay?

759
00:36:26,218 --> 00:36:27,850
I, uh...

760
00:36:30,288 --> 00:36:32,569
I broke up with Kyle.

761
00:36:34,910 --> 00:36:36,342
Oh, Steph.

762
00:36:39,298 --> 00:36:40,780
What happened?

763
00:36:43,135 --> 00:36:47,954
Shepherd, uh, cut into
his brain today without me.

764
00:36:49,524 --> 00:36:51,402
Yeah, she made me
sit in the waiting room,

765
00:36:51,426 --> 00:36:54,361
and all I could
think about was...

766
00:36:55,730 --> 00:36:57,830
I was him when I was a kid,

767
00:36:59,234 --> 00:37:02,194
in and out of hospitals
for years and...

768
00:37:04,923 --> 00:37:08,575
And I just can't sit
in the waiting room.

769
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:10,477
I can't handle it.

770
00:37:10,545 --> 00:37:12,657
I need to be on the
other side of the red line.

771
00:37:12,681 --> 00:37:15,359
I need to be helping
people and fixing people,

772
00:37:15,383 --> 00:37:18,534
and I can't do that
if I'm with him, so...

773
00:37:19,537 --> 00:37:21,238
So you chose surgery.

774
00:37:21,306 --> 00:37:22,822
No, I chose me.

775
00:37:27,896 --> 00:37:28,939
You want to go for a drink?

776
00:37:28,963 --> 00:37:30,396
No. No.

777
00:37:30,464 --> 00:37:33,544
I... I want to go to work.

778
00:37:38,857 --> 00:37:41,224
I thought today
was gonna be bad.

779
00:37:41,292 --> 00:37:43,226
I mean, epically bad.

780
00:37:43,294 --> 00:37:45,629
But? I got Mer and Hunt.

781
00:37:45,697 --> 00:37:49,499
See? I told you Mer
was gonna side with you.

782
00:37:49,567 --> 00:37:51,779
I think we have
a real shot at this.

783
00:37:51,803 --> 00:37:54,916
I feel better than I did
this morning. How are you?

784
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:58,441
I spent the day with
Dr. Robbins. I was on her service.

785
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:00,176
Oh, God.

786
00:38:00,245 --> 00:38:02,090
How was it? Was it terrible?

787
00:38:02,114 --> 00:38:04,063
Was she terrible to you?

788
00:38:07,035 --> 00:38:09,568
Not at all.

789
00:38:09,637 --> 00:38:11,037
She was great.

790
00:38:11,823 --> 00:38:12,888
Huh.

791
00:38:18,513 --> 00:38:19,990
Hey! Wait for me!

792
00:38:20,014 --> 00:38:21,347
Are you coming?

793
00:38:21,416 --> 00:38:23,733
We figured you'd be
staying at Owen's place.

794
00:38:23,802 --> 00:38:26,770
No, I told you, there is no me
and Owen. We're not a thing.

795
00:38:26,838 --> 00:38:29,517
Oh, 'cause it seemed like you
were when we saw his thing.

796
00:38:29,541 --> 00:38:30,818
Oh, my God!

797
00:38:30,842 --> 00:38:32,253
Are we not doing that anymore?

798
00:38:32,277 --> 00:38:33,777
You are a thing.

799
00:38:33,845 --> 00:38:36,056
It's happening all the
time, and it should,

800
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,614
but not on my couch.

801
00:38:37,683 --> 00:38:38,948
I second that.

802
00:38:39,017 --> 00:38:42,519
And you have happiness,
and you keep throwing it away.

803
00:38:42,587 --> 00:38:45,566
Stop the drama. Just
get on with it already.

804
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:47,524
She makes a really good point.

805
00:38:47,592 --> 00:38:49,304
Don't you start. You do it, too.

806
00:38:49,328 --> 00:38:51,439
You fell for an
intern and freaked out

807
00:38:51,463 --> 00:38:53,391
because it was
against the rules.

808
00:38:53,415 --> 00:38:54,797
Who cares about that?

809
00:38:54,866 --> 00:38:56,182
No one!

810
00:38:56,251 --> 00:38:58,250
Get it together, sisters.

811
00:39:02,123 --> 00:39:03,856
Amelia, come on.

812
00:39:03,925 --> 00:39:05,425
Let's go.

813
00:39:05,493 --> 00:39:06,659
We can't just leave her.

814
00:39:06,728 --> 00:39:08,795
Yes, we can.

815
00:39:08,863 --> 00:39:11,508
<i>The thing about being on
a team is it's a commitment.</i>

816
00:39:11,532 --> 00:39:13,099
<i>You have to bring it.</i>

817
00:39:13,168 --> 00:39:16,269
<i>You have to help with
the win no matter what.</i>

818
00:39:23,111 --> 00:39:25,678
<i>You may not always
like your teammates...</i>

819
00:39:28,683 --> 00:39:31,050
You're still sleeping
on the couch.

820
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:32,451
I know.

821
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:34,788
<i>You have to learn
to share the ball.</i>

822
00:39:46,084 --> 00:39:49,986
<i>You have to be all in,
one side or the other.</i>

823
00:40:02,583 --> 00:40:03,983
Hey. Oh! Ha!

824
00:40:04,052 --> 00:40:05,551
Whoa, sorry.

825
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:07,460
What are you doing?

826
00:40:07,505 --> 00:40:08,938
I went for a walk.

827
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:10,523
What are you doing?

828
00:40:10,592 --> 00:40:12,191
Oh, gee, okay.

829
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:13,260
Are you all right?

830
00:40:13,327 --> 00:40:14,371
Yeah, I think so.

831
00:40:14,395 --> 00:40:18,063
Okay. Yes. Here it goes. Okay.

832
00:40:18,132 --> 00:40:21,000
You and I are not
the kind of people

833
00:40:21,068 --> 00:40:23,586
who say, "I love you."

834
00:40:23,654 --> 00:40:25,332
Well... At least,
I'm not anymore

835
00:40:25,356 --> 00:40:27,185
because, uh, I know better.

836
00:40:27,209 --> 00:40:29,041
It's a lie.

837
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:31,155
You don't just meet
your perfect match

838
00:40:31,179 --> 00:40:33,224
and then everything
is beautiful and perfect,

839
00:40:33,248 --> 00:40:35,948
and that's not how life works.

840
00:40:36,017 --> 00:40:39,577
And if anyone understands
that, it is you and me.

841
00:40:41,322 --> 00:40:43,166
I'm having trouble
understanding you right now.

842
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:44,768
Oh, stick with me. Okay.

843
00:40:44,792 --> 00:40:48,111
I create these obstacles
out of dead people,

844
00:40:48,179 --> 00:40:49,478
and drugs

845
00:40:49,547 --> 00:40:51,981
that I may or may not
do, and sisters-in-law.

846
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:54,331
And I do... I know
that I make this tough.

847
00:40:55,003 --> 00:40:56,936
It feels like work.

848
00:40:59,674 --> 00:41:01,974
'Cause it's gonna be work.

849
00:41:03,745 --> 00:41:07,213
If you and I move
forward together...

850
00:41:08,282 --> 00:41:10,260
It is harder to...

851
00:41:10,284 --> 00:41:12,151
It's harder

852
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:15,380
to love somebody than
to walk away from them.

853
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:20,209
And this is... This would be...

854
00:41:21,229 --> 00:41:22,607
This... Oh, geez.

855
00:41:22,631 --> 00:41:25,164
This is messy and scary and...

856
00:41:25,233 --> 00:41:27,778
God, Owen, it just... It
scares the life out of me.

857
00:41:27,802 --> 00:41:29,769
I'm scared, too.

858
00:41:29,837 --> 00:41:31,721
<i>But if you play hard...</i>

859
00:41:35,327 --> 00:41:37,994
If you and I decide
to be together,

860
00:41:38,063 --> 00:41:41,630
I mean, really together,

861
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:44,901
I will wind up
screwing all of this up.

862
00:41:46,004 --> 00:41:47,948
Me, too. That is how I feel.

863
00:41:47,972 --> 00:41:51,074
I screw everything
up all the time.

864
00:41:54,545 --> 00:41:55,712
Oh, well.

865
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:57,880
<i>Give it your all,</i>

866
00:41:57,949 --> 00:41:59,949
<i>really commit...</i>

867
00:42:00,018 --> 00:42:01,417
Amelia...

868
00:42:01,485 --> 00:42:03,769
<i>victory is that much sweeter.</i>

869
00:42:06,374 --> 00:42:08,057
Let's screw some things up.
