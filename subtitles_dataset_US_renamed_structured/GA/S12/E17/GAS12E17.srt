1
00:00:04,372 --> 00:00:06,450
<i>Backaches, jaw pain, nausea.</i>

2
00:00:06,474 --> 00:00:07,806
Hey. Did you eat?

3
00:00:07,875 --> 00:00:09,686
Amelia got dinner.
It's nothing special.

4
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:11,960
Just a little pasta
from our regular place.

5
00:00:12,028 --> 00:00:14,708
Sit down. I'll grab
you a plate. I got it.

6
00:00:16,366 --> 00:00:19,767
<i>In men, these things are probably
exactly what they seem like.</i>

7
00:00:19,836 --> 00:00:20,952
Amelia's back.

8
00:00:21,022 --> 00:00:22,504
What's that supposed to mean?

9
00:00:22,573 --> 00:00:25,306
You leave all the doors
open, everywhere, all the time.

10
00:00:25,392 --> 00:00:27,070
What? Hey. Uh,
try the artichoke.

11
00:00:27,094 --> 00:00:30,845
Bathroom doors, cabinets,
everything open all the time.

12
00:00:30,914 --> 00:00:33,748
<i>But in women, they're all
symptoms of a heart attack.</i>

13
00:00:33,817 --> 00:00:35,595
Hey, Mer, do you want some wine?

14
00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:37,230
Unless that's not...
Is that... It's fine.

15
00:00:37,254 --> 00:00:39,371
Okay. You invited me back.

16
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:41,718
It's fine. Just close a
thing once in a while.

17
00:00:41,742 --> 00:00:44,076
Mer, if you've changed your
mind, say the word. I can go.

18
00:00:44,144 --> 00:00:45,961
No, it's fine.

19
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:47,440
<i>Sometimes the symptom</i>

20
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:49,175
<i>is actually hiding what's
going on underneath.</i>

21
00:00:49,199 --> 00:00:51,160
So which resident are
you guys nominating

22
00:00:51,184 --> 00:00:52,912
for the Preminger
Research Grant?

23
00:00:52,936 --> 00:00:54,464
I'm just gonna
go to bed. Me, too.

24
00:00:54,488 --> 00:00:56,299
We were just sitting
down together. Tired.

25
00:00:56,323 --> 00:00:57,773
Early morning.

26
00:00:57,842 --> 00:00:59,903
<i>It's all in the way
it presents itself.</i>

27
00:00:59,927 --> 00:01:03,361
"The winner of the grant is
awarded one full research year

28
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:05,631
"in residence at the
Preminger Research Center.

29
00:01:05,699 --> 00:01:08,200
"Each attending will
nominate one candidate

30
00:01:08,268 --> 00:01:11,002
"and submit them to
the chief of surgery,

31
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:14,351
"who will then review and
make a decision based on..."

32
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:15,974
Oh.

33
00:01:16,043 --> 00:01:17,809
I didn't know I was
eligible to apply.

34
00:01:17,878 --> 00:01:20,089
Yeah, it's open to
any resident any year.

35
00:01:20,113 --> 00:01:22,108
You gonna apply? No.

36
00:01:22,132 --> 00:01:25,333
I just got to Grey Sloan. I
can barely find the bathroom.

37
00:01:25,402 --> 00:01:27,464
"Resourceful." Okay, do
you think that I should write

38
00:01:27,488 --> 00:01:30,689
that I'm "resourceful"
or "inventive"?

39
00:01:30,758 --> 00:01:32,224
Mmm. Put that you're both.

40
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:33,887
Put that you're annoying
when you think out loud.

41
00:01:33,911 --> 00:01:35,928
Why are these spaces so small?

42
00:01:35,996 --> 00:01:37,996
These spaces cannot
contain how awesome I am.

43
00:01:38,615 --> 00:01:40,181
Okay.

44
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:43,435
Yes, this is gold. See?
I just won this thing.

45
00:01:43,504 --> 00:01:45,381
You don't even need
an awesome application.

46
00:01:45,405 --> 00:01:46,682
You have Shepherd
in your corner.

47
00:01:46,706 --> 00:01:49,285
Oh, I did, until you
took over her service.

48
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:50,408
I didn't do it.

49
00:01:50,477 --> 00:01:52,238
Webber's scramble did it. Sure.

50
00:01:52,262 --> 00:01:55,430
Well, when you apply next year,
Shepherd will have your back.

51
00:01:55,499 --> 00:01:56,932
And Grey and Torres.

52
00:01:57,001 --> 00:01:58,695
You'll be set. Hmm.

53
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,863
Remember when they
all hated you? Vividly.

54
00:02:00,887 --> 00:02:02,716
Okay, I'm done. Me, too.

55
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:04,172
Press submit on three?

56
00:02:04,241 --> 00:02:06,674
One, two, three.

57
00:02:06,744 --> 00:02:07,776
I did not meddle!

58
00:02:07,845 --> 00:02:09,677
You meddled. You are a meddler.

59
00:02:09,746 --> 00:02:11,279
He is the father of that baby.

60
00:02:11,348 --> 00:02:13,799
Suing his ex-wife for fraud
is no way to be a father.

61
00:02:13,868 --> 00:02:16,813
That hussy wouldn't be an ex-wife if
she hadn't signed those divorce papers

62
00:02:16,837 --> 00:02:19,081
without disclosing
her pregnancy. Hussy?

63
00:02:19,105 --> 00:02:20,633
This is April Kepner
we're talking about.

64
00:02:20,657 --> 00:02:22,758
And this is my grandchild
that we're talking about

65
00:02:22,826 --> 00:02:25,844
that I won't get to see unless
Jackson overturns that divorce

66
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:27,779
and gets his
parental rights back!

67
00:02:28,415 --> 00:02:29,731
Meddler.

68
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,183
You better stop saying that.

69
00:02:31,252 --> 00:02:32,551
I'll say what I want.

70
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:35,103
I am trying to help my son.

71
00:02:35,172 --> 00:02:36,916
You are a meddler, a busybody,

72
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:40,260
a helicopter mama, a
nosy Nellie, a buttinsky!

73
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:42,644
That is trash talk!
All up in the bug juice.

74
00:02:42,713 --> 00:02:43,873
You don't know
the flavor, woman.

75
00:02:43,897 --> 00:02:45,480
We said no trash
talk in the bedroom.

76
00:02:45,549 --> 00:02:47,830
We said no work
talk in the bedroom.

77
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:55,323
Just for the record, I
am right. You are wrong.

78
00:02:58,095 --> 00:03:00,135
Meddler.

79
00:03:02,365 --> 00:03:04,494
I still think I should
wait until next year

80
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:05,628
to apply for the grant.

81
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:07,230
Why? You're eligible now.

82
00:03:07,254 --> 00:03:09,087
Technically, but they
always give the grant

83
00:03:09,155 --> 00:03:10,788
to a senior resident anyway.

84
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:12,557
Except for when they don't.

85
00:03:12,626 --> 00:03:14,671
So you think I should try?

86
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:17,429
Look, if this is what you
want, then sure, apply.

87
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:21,266
It's just I'm finally
getting settled in here.

88
00:03:21,335 --> 00:03:24,936
I have friends.
I just met Sofia.

89
00:03:25,004 --> 00:03:28,039
I don't want to run across
the country for a year.

90
00:03:28,108 --> 00:03:31,409
I can wait. I want to be here.

91
00:03:34,281 --> 00:03:36,764
Well, I can accept that.

92
00:03:38,535 --> 00:03:40,535
So you are 14.

93
00:03:40,604 --> 00:03:41,736
Um...

94
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:43,233
Are your parents
here? Who brought you?

95
00:03:43,257 --> 00:03:44,856
I took the bus.

96
00:03:44,925 --> 00:03:48,660
Is this gonna take long? I have
to get back for my history test.

97
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:51,641
Um, well, I mean, it just
kind of sounds like a cold.

98
00:03:51,665 --> 00:03:53,098
I know, but it's just...

99
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:58,486
My stomach just
hurts when I cough

100
00:03:58,555 --> 00:04:01,823
or sneeze or move sometimes.

101
00:04:01,892 --> 00:04:03,975
Okay, let's take a look.

102
00:04:04,043 --> 00:04:05,283
Can you lean back?

103
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:09,037
Can you lift up
your shirt for me?

104
00:04:11,401 --> 00:04:13,585
Also, I'm pregnant.

105
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:18,156
Okay, you buried the lede there.

106
00:04:18,225 --> 00:04:20,291
Page OB. Okay.

107
00:04:20,344 --> 00:04:22,043
I don't understand.

108
00:04:22,112 --> 00:04:24,190
You haven't called back any of the
family law attorneys I recommended.

109
00:04:24,214 --> 00:04:26,258
Ma, I've really got to prep
this nasal reconstruction.

110
00:04:26,282 --> 00:04:28,883
Oh. Well, we have
choices. Money is no object.

111
00:04:28,952 --> 00:04:31,263
My baby needs a lawyer,
and I'm gonna get you the best.

112
00:04:31,287 --> 00:04:32,832
Ma, I'm done having
this conversation.

113
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:34,801
Reynolds is hard to
get a sit-down with,

114
00:04:34,825 --> 00:04:36,368
but you're an Avery, and that
ought to get us a phone call.

115
00:04:36,392 --> 00:04:37,937
I'm not sure I want
to Avery this yet.

116
00:04:37,961 --> 00:04:39,038
Oh. Yes, you do you
want to Avery this.

117
00:04:39,062 --> 00:04:41,029
Mother!

118
00:04:41,098 --> 00:04:43,665
April has the
power, all the power.

119
00:04:43,734 --> 00:04:46,015
You better get some power.

120
00:04:48,772 --> 00:04:50,983
So there is an organ
procurement at Overbrook?

121
00:04:51,007 --> 00:04:52,785
Yes, heart and liver.
Patient is getting critical.

122
00:04:52,809 --> 00:04:55,777
I am so glad, not about the
patient, about the procurement.

123
00:04:55,846 --> 00:04:58,880
It is the perfect excuse to
ditch Bailey's budget meeting.

124
00:04:58,948 --> 00:05:00,192
I want to ditch Bailey's
budget meeting.

125
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:01,449
I think we got it covered.

126
00:05:01,518 --> 00:05:02,862
Oh. Come on, Owen.
It's a budget meeting.

127
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:04,930
Okay, fine. I'll meet you
in the ambulance bay in 10.

128
00:05:04,954 --> 00:05:07,723
DeLuca's getting the coolers.

129
00:05:08,992 --> 00:05:10,486
We're... What are you doing?

130
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,226
DeLuca's coming?

131
00:05:15,014 --> 00:05:16,648
Sorry.

132
00:05:16,717 --> 00:05:18,861
Finish up a consult.
What are you doing here?

133
00:05:18,885 --> 00:05:21,097
Pierce asked me to cover
a heart recovery with Grey.

134
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:23,304
It's my heart recovery,
and you're making us late.

135
00:05:23,373 --> 00:05:24,717
Well, I got here
as soon as I could.

136
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:26,352
What happened to Pierce?
Said she had a budget meeting.

137
00:05:26,376 --> 00:05:28,671
She didn't want to ride with
DeLuca. Why isn't DeLuca here?

138
00:05:28,695 --> 00:05:30,895
Why am I here? All right.

139
00:05:30,964 --> 00:05:32,597
We're good. Let's move.

140
00:05:36,286 --> 00:05:37,385
How far along are you?

141
00:05:37,453 --> 00:05:39,471
I think, like, six months.

142
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:40,619
Who's your doctor?

143
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:42,741
You?

144
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:46,831
Have you been getting
any prenatal care at all?

145
00:05:49,983 --> 00:05:52,517
I am her mother. Jennifer.

146
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:56,354
Oh, my God. That's my mom.

147
00:05:56,423 --> 00:05:57,934
What is she doing
here? You called her?

148
00:05:57,958 --> 00:05:59,835
No. No, I didn't,
but... She can't know!

149
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:01,353
What? She doesn't
know I'm pregnant.

150
00:06:01,377 --> 00:06:03,628
You can't tell her,
please. I won't.

151
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:05,897
Promise. Yes, I promise.

152
00:06:27,187 --> 00:06:29,087
Jenny, um, I can help
you talk to your mom.

153
00:06:29,155 --> 00:06:31,039
No, you can't. She'll freak out.

154
00:06:31,108 --> 00:06:33,725
You're six months pregnant.
She's gonna find out soon.

155
00:06:33,794 --> 00:06:35,504
Why not tell her so
that she can help you?

156
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:37,528
Because this is not what we do.

157
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:41,366
That's what she says any time I
forget to do the dishes or get a B.

158
00:06:41,435 --> 00:06:43,851
"This is not what we do, Jenny."

159
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:47,422
I'm not supposed to even
have a boyfriend, so this would...

160
00:06:49,476 --> 00:06:50,675
Ow.

161
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:52,778
Dr. Kepner, this is...

162
00:06:52,846 --> 00:06:55,230
Jennifer? What
are you doing here?

163
00:06:55,298 --> 00:06:56,492
Did you track my phone again?

164
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:57,999
Yes, I tracked your phone again.

165
00:06:58,068 --> 00:06:59,567
Mom, that is so invasive.

166
00:06:59,636 --> 00:07:01,681
I pay for the phone, I
get to know where it is.

167
00:07:01,705 --> 00:07:02,799
Same goes for you.

168
00:07:02,823 --> 00:07:04,372
It's the middle
of the school day.

169
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,818
Why are you even
tracking me right now?

170
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:07,887
Well, you're not
in school, are you?

171
00:07:07,911 --> 00:07:10,111
This is not what we do, Jenny.

172
00:07:11,548 --> 00:07:13,781
Hi. Jenny, I'm Dr. Robbins.

173
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:16,095
I hear that you're having a
little... A little abdominal pain.

174
00:07:16,119 --> 00:07:18,986
And Dr. Robbins is
an abdominal doctor,

175
00:07:19,055 --> 00:07:22,090
so we're gonna take Jenny
up to CT to get a closer look,

176
00:07:22,159 --> 00:07:24,759
and we'll let you know as soon
as we get the results, all right?

177
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:26,311
Thank you.

178
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:30,549
Guess who's joining you on
Shepherd's DBS implantation.

179
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:32,629
Uh, can you get me up to
speed? Getting a little face time

180
00:07:32,653 --> 00:07:34,196
in with Shepherd before
the meeting tonight?

181
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,899
I am the wind beneath her wings.

182
00:07:35,923 --> 00:07:38,034
I just need to be sure
she remembers that.

183
00:07:38,058 --> 00:07:39,724
Well, I've got
your back. Ladies.

184
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:41,526
Let's go.

185
00:07:41,595 --> 00:07:43,495
Wait, wait, wait. Let me lead.

186
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:56,524
That's very nice.

187
00:07:56,593 --> 00:07:58,259
Oh.

188
00:07:58,327 --> 00:08:01,262
No, don't clap at that.
That was garbage.

189
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:05,183
Uh, Dr. Blake and
Dr. Shepherd and...

190
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:07,752
And who is this? Haven't
seen your face before.

191
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:08,821
It's a nice face.

192
00:08:08,872 --> 00:08:10,755
This is Dr. Edwards.

193
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:13,808
God, why are all the
doctors in this hospital so hot?

194
00:08:13,877 --> 00:08:15,154
Well, that's... Seriously,

195
00:08:15,178 --> 00:08:16,873
it's like a condition
of employment here.

196
00:08:16,897 --> 00:08:18,137
Let's talk about your brain.

197
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:19,480
Edwards, business time.

198
00:08:19,549 --> 00:08:21,282
Kyle Diaz, 34.

199
00:08:21,351 --> 00:08:22,784
Diagnosed two years ago

200
00:08:22,852 --> 00:08:24,797
with relapsing and
remitting multiple sclerosis.

201
00:08:24,821 --> 00:08:26,288
Increased symptoms recently.

202
00:08:26,356 --> 00:08:27,467
How come you know
so much about me,

203
00:08:27,491 --> 00:08:28,918
and I haven't even met you yet?

204
00:08:28,942 --> 00:08:32,076
Symptoms include persistent
tremor in the right hand.

205
00:08:32,145 --> 00:08:33,405
Yeah, this damn thing showed up

206
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:35,997
right as I was
landing a 13-city tour.

207
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:38,666
Only time I had bad timing.

208
00:08:38,735 --> 00:08:40,375
I prayed for a long
time for this break.

209
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:41,819
I mean, this is... This is big.

210
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:44,205
Yeah, it's huge for me. I
mean, I'm the opening act.

211
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:45,818
The audience won't
be there to see me,

212
00:08:45,842 --> 00:08:49,527
but I swear they'll
leave knowing my name.

213
00:08:49,596 --> 00:08:54,399
And I have to kick ass, but I
can't, not with this wobbly hand.

214
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:56,851
Well, deep brain
stimulation has been proven

215
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,087
to help alleviate intractable
tremors like yours.

216
00:08:59,155 --> 00:09:01,515
So when I wake up, maybe I
can show you how I really play.

217
00:09:03,577 --> 00:09:07,779
The plan is to actually keep
you conscious while we operate,

218
00:09:07,848 --> 00:09:10,482
using MRI images to target
the general area of concern.

219
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,649
Hmm.

220
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:13,718
Blake?

221
00:09:13,787 --> 00:09:17,122
No, I figured we'd be using
intraoperative micro-recordings

222
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:18,589
to precisely locate the nucleus.

223
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:21,742
Exactly, and how will we know
when the procedure is working?

224
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:25,446
Having our patient
perform delicate motor skills

225
00:09:25,515 --> 00:09:27,260
while we introduce
the electrodes.

226
00:09:27,284 --> 00:09:29,617
In Kyle's case, he
will play the guitar.

227
00:09:29,685 --> 00:09:32,686
Wait, so I'm... I'm
gonna play the guitar

228
00:09:32,755 --> 00:09:35,323
while you are poking
around in my brain?

229
00:09:35,392 --> 00:09:37,725
That way, we can know
exactly when we nail the tremor.

230
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:40,778
Well, it's impossible.

231
00:09:40,847 --> 00:09:42,791
No, it's possible. You'll
be awake and able to play.

232
00:09:42,815 --> 00:09:44,760
No, for you. I mean, I don't
know if you know what happens

233
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:46,818
when women hear me play.

234
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:49,254
Your hand is gonna
get a little shaky.

235
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:51,039
Well, I'll push through it.

236
00:09:51,107 --> 00:09:53,124
And Blake and I will be
performing the operation.

237
00:09:53,192 --> 00:09:54,220
Edwards, I need you with Kyle.

238
00:09:54,244 --> 00:09:56,594
I'll be... Blake's assisting?

239
00:09:56,663 --> 00:09:59,143
I need you to monitor the
tremor, let us know when we got it.

240
00:10:02,468 --> 00:10:05,286
Well, it's gonna be
one hell of a first date.

241
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,157
Her mother really
doesn't know? Nope.

242
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:29,494
It's got to be a lot of
work, hiding it for this long.

243
00:10:29,563 --> 00:10:31,062
Yeah, it is.

244
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,514
It's a hard thing to
keep under wraps.

245
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:41,300
Aren't we sort of obligated to
tell the mother she's pregnant?

246
00:10:41,324 --> 00:10:43,086
I mean, if the
kid's in danger...

247
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:46,277
Legally, we're obligated not to
unless the patient gives us permission.

248
00:10:46,346 --> 00:10:48,173
If it were my kid, I'd
want us to break that law.

249
00:10:48,197 --> 00:10:50,148
Oh, Warren, what
do you see here?

250
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:51,433
Blood in the lesser sac.

251
00:10:52,302 --> 00:10:53,535
Is that an aneurysm?

252
00:10:53,603 --> 00:10:56,654
Yeah, splenic artery
aneurysm. What are the risks?

253
00:10:56,723 --> 00:10:58,935
If it bursts, it could cause an
instant massive hemorrhage.

254
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,037
The patient and the baby
both could bleed to death.

255
00:11:01,061 --> 00:11:02,888
Now can we tell the mother?

256
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:04,411
No. Yes.

257
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:09,500
Hmm.

258
00:11:09,569 --> 00:11:12,170
Is that your name up there?

259
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:16,857
Seems that way. "Bowel
resection with Dr. Webber."

260
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:20,061
They say he's good.
Easy on the eyes, too.

261
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:21,879
Some men would send flowers.

262
00:11:21,948 --> 00:11:24,582
Nasty-ass necrotic
bowel is nice, too.

263
00:11:24,651 --> 00:11:27,017
Mmm-hmm. Complicated procedure.

264
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:29,420
Gives us time to talk,

265
00:11:29,489 --> 00:11:34,291
and since we are at work,
no subject is off limits.

266
00:11:36,078 --> 00:11:38,946
I'll see you in the
scrub room, Dr. Avery.

267
00:11:39,015 --> 00:11:42,495
You can yammer on all you
want. Doesn't mean I have to listen.

268
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:57,581
So who do you like for
this Preminger thing?

269
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:59,128
You know, who I don't
work with is Edwards,

270
00:11:59,152 --> 00:12:00,663
but Cristina really liked her.

271
00:12:00,687 --> 00:12:02,414
Amelia loves her.
Why aren't we moving?

272
00:12:02,438 --> 00:12:05,000
Bridge traffic. Amelia
moved back in, you know?

273
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:06,102
Did you know that? No.

274
00:12:06,126 --> 00:12:07,425
She was asking about you.

275
00:12:07,494 --> 00:12:09,304
Yeah, well, you can tell
her that I'm not an alcoholic

276
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:10,706
if that's what she's
worried about.

277
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,592
I don't think that's what
she was worried about.

278
00:12:12,616 --> 00:12:14,616
I think she's one. That's
what she's worried about.

279
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:18,085
Shepherd?

280
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:20,871
Shepherd drinks. I
bought her one once.

281
00:12:20,941 --> 00:12:24,170
When? Months ago. I didn't know.

282
00:12:24,194 --> 00:12:26,144
You did that. What?

283
00:12:26,213 --> 00:12:27,957
You did that to her? I
did what? I didn't know.

284
00:12:27,981 --> 00:12:30,042
I asked her. She said yes. She
didn't tell me she's an alcoholic.

285
00:12:30,066 --> 00:12:31,660
You did it! Hold on! Wait!

286
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:35,164
We have a job to do. The two
of you can kill each other later.

287
00:12:39,192 --> 00:12:41,826
A bubble in my artery?
Did I hurt the baby?

288
00:12:41,895 --> 00:12:44,874
No, no. It's so big that even a
sneeze could have made it bleed.

289
00:12:44,898 --> 00:12:46,943
Yeah, and the good news is
that the bleeding has stopped,

290
00:12:46,967 --> 00:12:51,369
but the splenic aneurysm
could burst at any moment.

291
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:54,583
Yeah, which would be very
dangerous for you and for your baby.

292
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,640
Oh, God. Oh, God.

293
00:12:56,709 --> 00:12:58,588
Jenny, listen, I can fix this.

294
00:12:58,612 --> 00:13:01,256
I can operate and make
sure that it doesn't bleed.

295
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,398
Surgery? Uh-uh.

296
00:13:03,483 --> 00:13:05,683
If we do surgery, my
mom will find out for sure.

297
00:13:05,752 --> 00:13:08,381
Maybe she should. I mean, don't
you want your mom's help and...

298
00:13:08,405 --> 00:13:13,291
No! She'll send me away or
make me give my baby away.

299
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:16,243
Can't you just give me some
pill to make it stay the way it is?

300
00:13:16,312 --> 00:13:19,792
We can give it time. I keep
you under close observation,

301
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:22,583
and there's a chance that
it could resolve on its own.

302
00:13:22,652 --> 00:13:24,685
Then let's do that. We'll wait.

303
00:13:24,754 --> 00:13:28,256
Jenny, it's far less dangerous to
do something about it right now.

304
00:13:28,325 --> 00:13:29,902
I think if your mom
had the information,

305
00:13:29,926 --> 00:13:32,046
she would opt...
You said we can wait.

306
00:13:32,261 --> 00:13:33,461
I want to wait.

307
00:13:34,096 --> 00:13:36,196
Okay, then we wait.

308
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:42,098
The better option is surgery.

309
00:13:42,122 --> 00:13:44,100
The only reason
she's choosing to wait

310
00:13:44,124 --> 00:13:46,035
is to avoid telling her
mother that she's pregnant.

311
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:48,659
She has the right to tell
her mom when she's ready.

312
00:13:48,728 --> 00:13:51,162
She's 14.

313
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:53,609
She needs her mom's
help to make this decision.

314
00:13:53,633 --> 00:13:56,534
You're thinking like a mother
because you're about to be one,

315
00:13:56,602 --> 00:13:59,204
but you're not.
You're not her mother.

316
00:13:59,272 --> 00:14:00,738
We're her doctors.

317
00:14:00,807 --> 00:14:01,918
What if it were Sofia?

318
00:14:01,942 --> 00:14:04,442
April! We can't.

319
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,823
We can tell her about the splenic
bleed but not about the pregnancy.

320
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,991
She's just gonna put her
baby and herself at risk.

321
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:11,966
Jenny's the patient.
She has the final say.

322
00:14:12,035 --> 00:14:13,867
It's the end of the discussion.

323
00:14:24,831 --> 00:14:27,398
This day is already
on my nerves.

324
00:14:27,467 --> 00:14:29,900
I've rounded on both
Grey and Torres' services.

325
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:31,814
I've finished their
post-op notes.

326
00:14:31,838 --> 00:14:35,673
My beautiful, genius brain is
on fire. I'm gonna get this grant.

327
00:14:35,742 --> 00:14:38,476
My beautiful, genius
brain is being wasted.

328
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:40,356
I've got to hold hands
with a hot rock star

329
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,764
while Blake assists
with his brain surgery.

330
00:14:42,832 --> 00:14:43,948
Ooh. Wait. Back up.

331
00:14:44,016 --> 00:14:45,816
No. No, don't.

332
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:49,131
He's hot, but he's nasty
hot, like in-your-face hot.

333
00:14:49,155 --> 00:14:51,316
He keeps aggressively
eye-sexing me.

334
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:54,008
He's not my kind of
thing. It's a distraction.

335
00:14:54,077 --> 00:14:56,238
Oh, God, I haven't
had sex in so long.

336
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:58,763
Oh. I had sex this morning.

337
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,033
I thought we were sharing.

338
00:15:02,102 --> 00:15:06,003
The point is, Shepherd
needs to see me shine today,

339
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:09,273
and there is Blake
being all shiny, too.

340
00:15:09,342 --> 00:15:11,120
I knew it. You
hate that Shepherd

341
00:15:11,144 --> 00:15:12,854
is taking Blake under her wing.

342
00:15:12,878 --> 00:15:13,961
Because it's my wing!

343
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:16,964
Blake has been on neuro
for, what, two weeks?

344
00:15:17,033 --> 00:15:20,196
And she gets to scrub
in over me? Really?

345
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,931
Blake probably can't
even clip an aneurysm.

346
00:15:21,955 --> 00:15:24,716
Stephanie... No, come
on! She's from Dillard.

347
00:15:33,233 --> 00:15:34,410
All right, listen, I know
you don't want to, but...

348
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:35,866
No, you listen.

349
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,586
She sat across that table,
looked my son in the eye,

350
00:15:38,655 --> 00:15:41,015
didn't say a damn thing
about the pregnancy,

351
00:15:41,057 --> 00:15:43,357
treating him like he's
some inconvenience.

352
00:15:43,426 --> 00:15:45,371
And he is the baby's
father. Well, that may be true,

353
00:15:45,395 --> 00:15:47,106
but we should be
helping them through this.

354
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:49,546
What choice do we
have other than to fight?

355
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:51,048
A lawsuit, though?

356
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:53,395
If Jackson can make a case
that April committed fraud,

357
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:56,253
he's got a shot at getting
full custody of that baby.

358
00:15:56,322 --> 00:15:58,990
If April's gonna fight
dirty, Jackson can, too.

359
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:01,125
This is about my
grandchild. Oh, really?

360
00:16:01,194 --> 00:16:02,471
Because I don't
see a grandchild.

361
00:16:02,495 --> 00:16:04,412
All I see are two
kids in trouble.

362
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,525
And they aren't your kids.

363
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:08,989
Maybe just keep your
opinions to yourself.

364
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:12,803
Understood.

365
00:16:12,872 --> 00:16:14,889
But you're my wife,

366
00:16:14,957 --> 00:16:16,152
and I think I should
be able to tell you

367
00:16:16,176 --> 00:16:17,486
when you're making a wrong turn,

368
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:19,177
and this is a very wrong turn.

369
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:27,696
I can't believe we sat
in traffic for an hour.

370
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,703
You can just relax. We made it.

371
00:16:29,772 --> 00:16:31,183
What are they doing? Are they
already recovering the heart?

372
00:16:31,207 --> 00:16:33,087
No, no. Hunt, something's wrong.

373
00:16:34,077 --> 00:16:35,338
Hey, what are you
doing to our heart?

374
00:16:35,362 --> 00:16:36,438
Crapped the bed
about two minutes ago.

375
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:37,523
You guys are Grey Sloan?

376
00:16:37,547 --> 00:16:38,746
What are you saying?

377
00:16:38,815 --> 00:16:40,459
Lidocaine. It's in
V-fib. Arrhythmic.

378
00:16:40,483 --> 00:16:42,127
We're trying to keep it pumping
to perfuse the other organs.

379
00:16:42,151 --> 00:16:43,684
Okay, move aside. Let me see.

380
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:45,564
You told me this is a
good, healthy heart.

381
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:48,017
He became hyperkalemic.
We tried to reverse it with insulin.

382
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:49,367
Why is it fibrillating now?

383
00:16:49,391 --> 00:16:50,503
Okay, Hunt, just let me work.

384
00:16:50,527 --> 00:16:51,954
Charge it 20. SURGEON 2: Charge.

385
00:16:51,978 --> 00:16:53,505
We have no heart,
we have no liver.

386
00:16:53,529 --> 00:16:54,840
One's no good without the
other. They'll reallocate it.

387
00:16:54,864 --> 00:16:56,308
Riggs? NATHAN: Clear.

388
00:16:56,332 --> 00:16:58,412
Come on!

389
00:16:59,536 --> 00:17:02,402
Come on! Come on, baby. Come on.

390
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:12,096
It's gone.

391
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,860
This heart's dead. I'm sorry.

392
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:26,644
We need to do the
calculations with MRI.

393
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:28,707
I need someone to go
supervise Kyle's head frame.

394
00:17:28,731 --> 00:17:30,491
I can do it. Blake, go.

395
00:17:34,403 --> 00:17:36,487
I was hoping to be
in the field, assisting.

396
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:38,606
I need you with
Kyle. He likes you.

397
00:17:38,674 --> 00:17:41,119
He thinks I'm a
challenge, correctly.

398
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:43,276
Then challenge
him. He'll be calmer.

399
00:17:49,952 --> 00:17:52,687
So the Preminger Grant
nomination is tonight.

400
00:17:52,755 --> 00:17:54,221
Edwards,

401
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:57,274
I'm not gonna discuss a
confidential recommendation.

402
00:17:57,343 --> 00:17:59,509
I know. I'm not asking. Mmm.

403
00:18:01,513 --> 00:18:04,882
I'm just hoping you bear in
mind our significant history

404
00:18:04,951 --> 00:18:06,729
when making your
recommendation. Edwards!

405
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:08,319
I'm not asking.

406
00:18:10,623 --> 00:18:11,856
Edwards, look at me.

407
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,991
You and I are not
allowed to discuss

408
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,626
whether or not I will be singing

409
00:18:15,694 --> 00:18:19,513
your praises to
Dr. Bailey tonight.

410
00:18:19,582 --> 00:18:24,185
To do so would be
unprofessional, unethical,

411
00:18:24,253 --> 00:18:28,889
and not at all cool, so I
am not going to discuss it.

412
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:30,478
Understood? Understood.

413
00:18:31,177 --> 00:18:32,209
All right.

414
00:18:38,384 --> 00:18:41,418
She said, "She's from Dillard,"
like it's a welding school.

415
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:42,487
And what'd you say?

416
00:18:42,555 --> 00:18:43,999
Nothing. I just stood there.

417
00:18:44,023 --> 00:18:45,489
Ouch.

418
00:18:45,558 --> 00:18:48,638
I know. I know. I didn't have my
words. Why didn't I have my words?

419
00:18:48,678 --> 00:18:50,261
Well, just say your words now.

420
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:54,031
Okay, okay. I thought
we were friends.

421
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,416
No, weak. Better words.

422
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:59,515
I know this place
can be competitive,

423
00:18:59,539 --> 00:19:02,656
and that you can be an
insecure bitch sometimes,

424
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:05,192
but you would not be
talking behind my back

425
00:19:05,261 --> 00:19:06,905
if you weren't scared to death

426
00:19:06,929 --> 00:19:09,713
that somebody might give
you a run for your money.

427
00:19:09,782 --> 00:19:13,367
And I might be from
Dillard, but I am here now!

428
00:19:13,436 --> 00:19:15,480
I'm right behind you,
breathing down your neck,

429
00:19:15,504 --> 00:19:19,123
and I am a dark freaking horse!

430
00:19:19,192 --> 00:19:20,472
Drop the mic and walk away.

431
00:19:25,014 --> 00:19:26,830
And I'm having sex tonight.

432
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,333
Hey.

433
00:19:29,402 --> 00:19:30,779
I'm inviting all
you lovely people

434
00:19:30,803 --> 00:19:32,297
over to the house
tonight for dinner.

435
00:19:32,321 --> 00:19:33,520
Oh.

436
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:35,273
Like a... Like a dinner party.

437
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:36,919
We're not doing that again.

438
00:19:36,943 --> 00:19:38,063
Just takeout. Whatever.

439
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,705
Just come over at
8:00, and I'll feed you.

440
00:19:39,729 --> 00:19:41,423
But we have the nomination
meeting for the Preminger Grant.

441
00:19:41,447 --> 00:19:42,546
Fine. 8:30.

442
00:19:42,615 --> 00:19:44,876
Ben and Bailey will
be going home at 8:30.

443
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,266
I'm having great sex tonight.

444
00:19:46,335 --> 00:19:47,880
I might be having sex tonight.

445
00:19:47,904 --> 00:19:49,864
I mean, I don't know
yet. We don't really plan it.

446
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:52,823
You guys have to come.

447
00:19:52,892 --> 00:19:54,369
Amelia just moved back in,

448
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:57,094
and Meredith and Amelia
need to ease into it, okay,

449
00:19:57,163 --> 00:19:59,224
or it's gonna be... It'll be...

450
00:20:00,382 --> 00:20:02,060
It's gonna start
as something small

451
00:20:02,084 --> 00:20:04,096
that will snowball
into something big,

452
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,736
and there will be blood.

453
00:20:05,804 --> 00:20:07,637
This thing is fragile.

454
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:10,541
But if you guys are
there, then it can stay nice.

455
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:11,909
Oh! Oh.

456
00:20:11,978 --> 00:20:13,578
So you want us to
come to be a buffer?

457
00:20:13,646 --> 00:20:15,395
Yes, thank you. Mmm-hmm.

458
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:17,810
Like a human shield? You
get it. So you'll be there?

459
00:20:17,834 --> 00:20:18,932
Sex. God, no.

460
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:22,870
So for now, we wait to see

461
00:20:22,938 --> 00:20:25,672
if your daughter's abdominal
bleed resolves on its own.

462
00:20:25,741 --> 00:20:28,020
You think waiting
is the best option?

463
00:20:28,044 --> 00:20:29,576
Well, it's what Jenny wants.

464
00:20:30,413 --> 00:20:32,246
Jenny is 14.

465
00:20:32,315 --> 00:20:34,815
When I was 14, I was
stealing street signs,

466
00:20:34,884 --> 00:20:36,795
and getting knocked
up by my loser boyfriend,

467
00:20:36,819 --> 00:20:40,988
so forgive me for not trusting a
14-year-old to make judgment calls.

468
00:20:41,057 --> 00:20:42,734
I'm asking what you think.

469
00:20:42,758 --> 00:20:44,925
I think that surgery
is the better option.

470
00:20:46,396 --> 00:20:48,729
Then that's what we'll do.

471
00:20:48,797 --> 00:20:52,499
Of course, you know, with
surgery, there are always risks.

472
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:57,470
Surgery would happen
when? Today or...

473
00:20:59,141 --> 00:21:01,325
Actually, there
is one more thing.

474
00:21:01,394 --> 00:21:03,678
Dr. Kepner. What is it?

475
00:21:03,746 --> 00:21:05,224
What are you not telling me?

476
00:21:05,248 --> 00:21:08,015
There is also the risk that
Jenny could lose her baby.

477
00:21:08,551 --> 00:21:10,367
Her what?

478
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:11,736
Jenny is pregnant.

479
00:21:24,284 --> 00:21:26,128
How long? Mom, listen...

480
00:21:26,152 --> 00:21:27,392
How long?

481
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:29,587
I don't know, like, six
months or something.

482
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:32,373
Why would you tell her?

483
00:21:32,441 --> 00:21:33,974
Look at me. Not them. Me.

484
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:38,595
How many times have I told
you, "Be careful, be smart"?

485
00:21:38,664 --> 00:21:41,731
Not to end up like
me. How many times?

486
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,335
Yeah, Mom, like a million times

487
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:47,287
that I am your biggest,
stupidest mistake!

488
00:21:47,356 --> 00:21:50,457
Sorry I messed
up your life so bad!

489
00:21:50,525 --> 00:21:51,937
Jennifer, that is
not what I meant.

490
00:21:51,961 --> 00:21:54,862
And I'm sorry I'm
screwing my life up, too.

491
00:21:54,931 --> 00:21:58,232
Go ahead. I'm just
waiting for you to say it.

492
00:21:58,318 --> 00:22:00,334
"This is not what we do, Jenny."

493
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:01,535
It's not.

494
00:22:01,604 --> 00:22:02,636
You screwed this up.

495
00:22:02,705 --> 00:22:03,949
She needed to
know all the risks.

496
00:22:03,973 --> 00:22:05,500
No, she didn't. Yes, she did.

497
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:07,536
If she was gonna convince
Jenny to get that surgery, yes.

498
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,777
How's that going so far?

499
00:22:09,845 --> 00:22:11,111
There's a risk either way.

500
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,608
God, Mom!

501
00:22:12,632 --> 00:22:13,776
Are you done with your side?

502
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,843
I'm working on it.

503
00:22:14,867 --> 00:22:16,044
It's just these...

504
00:22:16,068 --> 00:22:17,868
Damn adhesions.
Yeah, I see them.

505
00:22:17,937 --> 00:22:19,177
Yeah.

506
00:22:20,072 --> 00:22:21,405
I've been here before.

507
00:22:21,474 --> 00:22:24,375
We need enough space
to get a secure closure.

508
00:22:24,444 --> 00:22:25,887
I'm talking about Jackson.

509
00:22:25,911 --> 00:22:28,178
Looped PDS.

510
00:22:28,247 --> 00:22:33,083
Jackson's father could be
loving and generous and fun.

511
00:22:33,151 --> 00:22:35,820
He also could be a
child. Selfish, spiteful.

512
00:22:35,888 --> 00:22:38,583
When we ended, he
just wanted to hurt me,

513
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:41,047
so he took the only
thing that mattered.

514
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:42,550
He took Jackson.

515
00:22:42,595 --> 00:22:43,906
He took him across country,

516
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:45,807
thought he could
take my boy from me,

517
00:22:45,831 --> 00:22:47,976
and that I would just roll over.

518
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,550
I told him he didn't know
who the hell he married.

519
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:54,788
I fought for my son, and
I'm not about to stop fighting.

520
00:22:54,857 --> 00:22:59,125
Richard, war is ugly,
senseless, and scary as hell,

521
00:22:59,194 --> 00:23:02,863
but there are some things
worth going to war over.

522
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:10,207
Maybe you can close without me.

523
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:17,911
We can monitor
each cell in his brain.

524
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:20,013
Mmm-hmm.

525
00:23:20,082 --> 00:23:23,450
Dr. Shepherd, you have
plus 10 y, minus 20 on z.

526
00:23:23,518 --> 00:23:24,685
Almost there.

527
00:23:25,721 --> 00:23:27,438
Keep him talking.

528
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:29,701
Kyle, what kind of
music do you play?

529
00:23:29,725 --> 00:23:31,103
Oh. Now, you want
to get to know me?

530
00:23:31,127 --> 00:23:32,993
Right now, it's my job.

531
00:23:33,062 --> 00:23:34,382
How's he doing, Edwards?

532
00:23:35,364 --> 00:23:37,981
Why don't you try to
play me something?

533
00:23:44,389 --> 00:23:47,274
Uh, persistent tremor.
No improvement.

534
00:23:47,343 --> 00:23:48,637
Don't you think
it's a little weird

535
00:23:48,661 --> 00:23:50,995
that you're seeing
the inside of my brain

536
00:23:51,063 --> 00:23:53,347
and you haven't seen the
inside of my apartment?

537
00:23:53,416 --> 00:23:55,632
You do not know
when to quit, do you?

538
00:23:55,701 --> 00:23:58,569
Come on! Amuse me.

539
00:23:58,637 --> 00:24:01,137
You said it's like
your job or something.

540
00:24:04,243 --> 00:24:06,154
Dr. Shepherd, he's
developed a left facial droop.

541
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:07,422
Signal's getting distorted.

542
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:09,897
I have a small hemorrhage
here. What next?

543
00:24:09,965 --> 00:24:11,676
Uh. Pull back on the
probe, close him up,

544
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,245
and wait for the bleed to stop.

545
00:24:13,269 --> 00:24:14,496
Or you can control
the bleed right now.

546
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,130
Use a biopsy needle
to irrigate the bleed,

547
00:24:16,154 --> 00:24:18,022
then dilute and
suction until it stops.

548
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:19,439
Good call, Edwards.

549
00:24:19,508 --> 00:24:22,009
Biopsy needle.

550
00:24:22,078 --> 00:24:24,439
I ca... I can't feel parts of
my face. What is happening?

551
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:26,346
You have a very small
bleed in your brain.

552
00:24:26,415 --> 00:24:28,209
Don't worry. Dr. Shepherd
has it under control.

553
00:24:28,233 --> 00:24:29,599
Syringe. Blake, now.

554
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,569
What is she doing?

555
00:24:33,405 --> 00:24:34,421
She's free-styling.

556
00:24:36,658 --> 00:24:39,593
She's a rock star, too,
all right? I'm right here.

557
00:24:44,266 --> 00:24:46,016
What happened?

558
00:24:46,085 --> 00:24:48,396
I was giving her a routine abdominal
exam when her pressure bottomed out.

559
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:50,955
It hurts so much.

560
00:24:51,023 --> 00:24:52,122
Tell me what's wrong.

561
00:24:52,191 --> 00:24:53,431
We're gonna take a look, okay?

562
00:24:55,544 --> 00:24:58,112
She's hypotensive,
and her crit's at 18.

563
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:00,764
Tell me what's
happening. It's not labor.

564
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:02,399
Your aneurysm has ruptured,

565
00:25:02,468 --> 00:25:04,412
and I know you didn't want
surgery, but now we have no choice.

566
00:25:04,436 --> 00:25:06,014
We're gonna get you into the OR.

567
00:25:06,038 --> 00:25:08,055
Mom? They've got you, honey.

568
00:25:08,123 --> 00:25:09,973
Everything is gonna be fine.

569
00:25:17,416 --> 00:25:19,044
What a waste. How's that?

570
00:25:19,068 --> 00:25:21,902
Such a waste. The heart.

571
00:25:21,971 --> 00:25:23,070
I'm sorry for your guy.

572
00:25:23,138 --> 00:25:24,816
Well, maybe if we'd
gotten here sooner.

573
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,017
It wouldn't have
made a difference.

574
00:25:26,041 --> 00:25:27,602
The heart was in V-fib.
Damage was done.

575
00:25:27,626 --> 00:25:29,103
They should have
known... You're right.

576
00:25:29,127 --> 00:25:30,371
It couldn't have been your
fault. It's never your fault,

577
00:25:30,395 --> 00:25:31,439
not with Amelia...

578
00:25:31,463 --> 00:25:33,046
I didn't know, all right?

579
00:25:33,115 --> 00:25:34,893
If I caused her a problem, I'm
sorry, but she didn't tell me...

580
00:25:34,917 --> 00:25:36,795
Disaster happens
wherever you are

581
00:25:36,819 --> 00:25:38,780
because you are
there, like with Megan.

582
00:25:38,804 --> 00:25:41,387
All right, no! Owen, I'm
not gonna do this again!

583
00:25:41,456 --> 00:25:43,536
No? Okay, no, all right?

584
00:25:47,496 --> 00:25:49,456
I think you're starting
to drive yourself crazy.

585
00:25:49,831 --> 00:25:51,331
It's him.

586
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,280
At some point, you just
have to learn to let go.

587
00:25:54,921 --> 00:25:57,332
Amelia took that drink. It doesn't
matter who offered it to her.

588
00:25:57,356 --> 00:25:59,123
She would tell you that herself.

589
00:25:59,191 --> 00:26:01,725
Riggs tried to talk your
sister off that chopper.

590
00:26:01,794 --> 00:26:02,926
What?

591
00:26:02,995 --> 00:26:04,428
She needed to
be with her patient.

592
00:26:04,497 --> 00:26:05,990
He tried to go. She
wouldn't let him.

593
00:26:08,684 --> 00:26:10,612
That's what he told you, that
he... That's what he told me.

594
00:26:10,636 --> 00:26:13,076
Meredith, he didn't
say anything to her.

595
00:26:13,973 --> 00:26:17,040
He wasn't anywhere
near that chopper.

596
00:26:17,109 --> 00:26:21,161
He was off screwing some
woman from supply corps again.

597
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:24,293
That's why Megan got on the
chopper, to get away from him.

598
00:26:24,317 --> 00:26:25,460
My sister was leaving him.

599
00:26:25,484 --> 00:26:27,479
When I said, "We
hate him," I meant it.

600
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:36,793
You hanging in there, Kyle?

601
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:39,646
Oh, hey.

602
00:26:39,715 --> 00:26:40,914
You're all right.

603
00:26:40,983 --> 00:26:43,667
Loss of speech is normal.
It's temporary, okay?

604
00:26:43,719 --> 00:26:45,702
Hey. It'll come back.

605
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:47,070
Dr. Shepherd's almost done.

606
00:26:47,139 --> 00:26:49,623
Stay with me, Kyle. Almost done.

607
00:26:52,578 --> 00:26:54,506
- You're okay.
- Give me a minute.

608
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:56,024
Dr. Shepherd, there isn't any...

609
00:26:56,048 --> 00:26:57,608
She said give her a minute.

610
00:27:05,824 --> 00:27:07,324
Bleeding has stopped.

611
00:27:09,728 --> 00:27:11,211
Kyle, check your hand.

612
00:27:12,614 --> 00:27:13,947
Okay.

613
00:27:17,703 --> 00:27:19,003
No tremor.

614
00:27:20,906 --> 00:27:23,089
Okay, can you speak now?

615
00:27:28,948 --> 00:27:30,163
You miss me?

616
00:27:31,567 --> 00:27:33,767
Welcome back, Kyle.

617
00:27:33,835 --> 00:27:36,787
I showed you my moves.
Time to show us yours.

618
00:27:36,856 --> 00:27:39,606
All right, come on.
Your turn to free-style.

619
00:28:22,902 --> 00:28:26,103
This wasn't my fault.
Telling the mother.

620
00:28:27,606 --> 00:28:29,450
Stress doesn't just
cause arteries to rupture.

621
00:28:29,474 --> 00:28:31,314
You know that. ARIZONA: I do.

622
00:28:31,577 --> 00:28:32,709
Doesn't make it right.

623
00:28:32,778 --> 00:28:34,018
It felt right.

624
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:35,390
It felt like she needed to know,

625
00:28:35,414 --> 00:28:36,508
like it was the
right thing to do.

626
00:28:36,532 --> 00:28:37,548
I know the feeling.

627
00:28:39,484 --> 00:28:40,829
This is not the same thing.

628
00:28:40,853 --> 00:28:44,888
I'm just saying that
I know how you felt

629
00:28:47,659 --> 00:28:50,477
in that moment. I know.

630
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:02,272
Mmm.

631
00:29:02,341 --> 00:29:03,873
Turn around.

632
00:29:03,942 --> 00:29:05,509
Oh.

633
00:29:05,578 --> 00:29:07,944
God bless your heart. Mmm.

634
00:29:09,281 --> 00:29:12,416
I'm glad you told me
about Jackson's father.

635
00:29:13,452 --> 00:29:15,830
Now you understand
why I'm doing this.

636
00:29:15,854 --> 00:29:17,153
Not a bit.

637
00:29:17,222 --> 00:29:18,755
Ah.

638
00:29:18,824 --> 00:29:21,224
It was an awfully sad story...

639
00:29:21,293 --> 00:29:24,494
but it was your
story, not theirs,

640
00:29:24,563 --> 00:29:27,097
and stop trying
to make it theirs.

641
00:29:27,165 --> 00:29:28,599
I don't have a choice, Richard.

642
00:29:30,002 --> 00:29:34,504
The woman I married
believed in second chances,

643
00:29:34,573 --> 00:29:37,941
that anything was possible

644
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:41,344
and that the glass doesn't
always have to be half empty.

645
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:46,583
You said your ex-husband
didn't know the woman he married.

646
00:29:48,253 --> 00:29:49,419
Well, I do.

647
00:29:53,225 --> 00:29:56,504
I'm only letting you yammer on
because your hands are so magical.

648
00:29:56,528 --> 00:29:57,827
Lower.

649
00:29:57,896 --> 00:29:59,162
Well, that's a start.

650
00:30:04,786 --> 00:30:08,021
We had to remove your
spleen to stop the bleeding.

651
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:09,423
But the baby's fine.

652
00:30:09,491 --> 00:30:11,824
Good fetal
heartbeat, very strong.

653
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:13,410
And my mom?

654
00:30:13,479 --> 00:30:16,013
She's waiting to see you
whenever you're ready.

655
00:30:17,415 --> 00:30:18,998
Yeah? Okay. Warren.

656
00:30:31,763 --> 00:30:33,213
Is she okay?

657
00:30:33,282 --> 00:30:34,931
She is.

658
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,117
And the baby? They're both fine.

659
00:30:37,185 --> 00:30:39,305
Mom. Don't speak.

660
00:30:39,521 --> 00:30:40,887
Listen.

661
00:30:42,424 --> 00:30:45,759
This just isn't what we do.

662
00:30:48,597 --> 00:30:51,130
You tell me when
you're in trouble.

663
00:30:51,199 --> 00:30:54,233
You don't walk around
scared and alone,

664
00:30:54,303 --> 00:30:56,403
not when you have
me. Do you hear me?

665
00:30:56,471 --> 00:30:57,870
Uh-huh.

666
00:30:57,939 --> 00:30:59,819
Not when you're
having my grandbaby.

667
00:31:13,172 --> 00:31:14,172
Hey.

668
00:31:16,475 --> 00:31:17,640
Hi.

669
00:31:19,744 --> 00:31:22,678
Listen, what I said before,
that was just me being...

670
00:31:22,747 --> 00:31:23,764
Insecure.

671
00:31:25,433 --> 00:31:27,996
I deserve that. You could
have said a lot worse.

672
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:30,087
I did, earlier.

673
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,680
I'm very sorry.

674
00:31:36,645 --> 00:31:38,512
The attendings got
out of their meeting.

675
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:40,107
Already? Did you hear anything?

676
00:31:40,131 --> 00:31:43,233
Uh. Yeah, I heard
that Penny applied,

677
00:31:43,301 --> 00:31:45,896
which is weird because
she didn't say anything.

678
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:48,221
You applied? When? Today.

679
00:31:48,289 --> 00:31:51,424
The deadline was at noon,
and I decided I should at least try,

680
00:31:51,493 --> 00:31:53,527
even if I don't really
have a chance.

681
00:31:53,595 --> 00:31:54,861
Oh. You have a chance.

682
00:31:54,929 --> 00:31:57,414
Alex told me that your
name came up a lot.

683
00:31:57,482 --> 00:32:00,733
Actually, Grey had your back.

684
00:32:00,802 --> 00:32:02,063
Shepherd even. Shepherd?

685
00:32:02,087 --> 00:32:03,899
I just don't understand
why you didn't tell us.

686
00:32:03,923 --> 00:32:05,756
You pretended to
be all cheerleadery.

687
00:32:05,824 --> 00:32:07,452
It's just, it's a
little... Snakey.

688
00:32:07,476 --> 00:32:10,076
I wasn't trying
to hide anything.

689
00:32:10,162 --> 00:32:12,962
Wow.

690
00:32:13,031 --> 00:32:14,271
Never saw it coming.

691
00:32:16,451 --> 00:32:18,051
Well played.

692
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:20,153
I wasn't playing
anything. I just decided...

693
00:32:20,222 --> 00:32:21,333
Yeah.

694
00:32:21,357 --> 00:32:22,922
Wow.

695
00:32:23,692 --> 00:32:25,091
Good luck.

696
00:32:32,651 --> 00:32:37,420
And on the 8th, he had a 4.1
rise. Let's get it to 3.2 just to make...

697
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:43,570
Excuse me. Okay.

698
00:32:45,714 --> 00:32:47,164
Mate, this has to stop.

699
00:32:47,216 --> 00:32:48,726
You're right. This has to stop.

700
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:52,619
Megan called me
right before she...

701
00:32:52,688 --> 00:32:56,055
All right, she told
me everything.

702
00:32:56,124 --> 00:32:59,676
So yeah, you should just stop
'cause I see you. You can't do this.

703
00:32:59,744 --> 00:33:02,612
You can't just come in here
and pretend to be some nice guy,

704
00:33:02,681 --> 00:33:07,383
pretend to be this hero,
and lie and fool everyone,

705
00:33:07,452 --> 00:33:10,870
like Grey and Bailey
and Pierce and Amelia.

706
00:33:10,939 --> 00:33:13,273
You can't just take more
people away from me.

707
00:33:13,341 --> 00:33:14,861
You can't do it,
and I won't let you.

708
00:33:26,805 --> 00:33:28,622
Benjamin Warren.

709
00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:30,590
Miranda Bailey.

710
00:33:30,659 --> 00:33:33,910
You didn't submit your
application for the Preminger Grant!

711
00:33:33,979 --> 00:33:35,261
No, of course I didn't.

712
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:36,691
What do you mean, "of course"?

713
00:33:36,715 --> 00:33:38,243
You're asking me why
I didn't apply for a grant

714
00:33:38,267 --> 00:33:39,760
that's gonna take me
across the country?

715
00:33:39,784 --> 00:33:41,446
What, am I supposed
to jump at the chance

716
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:43,753
to leave my wife and
kid for a year or more?

717
00:33:43,822 --> 00:33:45,982
It was an incredible
opportunity.

718
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:47,769
We could have
figured something out.

719
00:33:47,793 --> 00:33:50,093
You know, it's not
my turn. Not right now.

720
00:33:50,162 --> 00:33:51,694
You're Chief. We
need to be here.

721
00:33:52,448 --> 00:33:54,729
And you're okay with that?

722
00:33:55,067 --> 00:33:57,100
Well, it'll be my turn sometime.

723
00:33:57,169 --> 00:34:00,469
You know, when it is,
you'll, uh, do the same for me.

724
00:34:01,639 --> 00:34:02,639
Right?

725
00:34:14,002 --> 00:34:17,587
So who'd you pick, Chief?

726
00:34:17,656 --> 00:34:19,789
Are you kidding me? It's me.

727
00:34:19,858 --> 00:34:22,758
I read the e-mail five times
to see where I got it wrong,

728
00:34:22,827 --> 00:34:24,694
but I didn't. I won.

729
00:34:24,763 --> 00:34:26,880
Bailey gave me the
Preminger Grant.

730
00:34:26,948 --> 00:34:28,381
Are you kidding me?

731
00:34:28,450 --> 00:34:29,715
Why do you keep saying that?

732
00:34:31,103 --> 00:34:35,822
Oh, no. No, yeah.
Well, it's just... Yay, you!

733
00:34:35,891 --> 00:34:38,575
Come on. Let's go celebrate.

734
00:34:45,634 --> 00:34:46,874
You recommended Blake?

735
00:34:47,786 --> 00:34:49,636
I recommended you.

736
00:34:49,705 --> 00:34:50,898
Well, then why
did Karev say you...

737
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:54,007
Then Blake's name came
up from a few people.

738
00:34:54,075 --> 00:34:55,854
They asked my opinion.
And what did you say?

739
00:34:55,878 --> 00:34:57,288
Well, I'm not gonna
tell you what I said.

740
00:34:57,312 --> 00:34:59,646
I gave an honest
answer to a question.

741
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:02,342
You sunk me.

742
00:35:03,218 --> 00:35:04,917
I endorsed you.

743
00:35:04,986 --> 00:35:06,753
After that, it's
out of my hands.

744
00:35:06,838 --> 00:35:10,206
You've been trying to find a
way to get rid of her for months,

745
00:35:10,258 --> 00:35:11,958
and to use this,

746
00:35:12,027 --> 00:35:15,427
you go right past somebody
who you know deserves it more,

747
00:35:15,481 --> 00:35:17,459
someone who has
been there for you,

748
00:35:17,483 --> 00:35:19,961
who stepped in when you couldn't
even handle doing your job...

749
00:35:19,985 --> 00:35:21,685
Edwards.

750
00:35:23,088 --> 00:35:24,688
This is the attendings' lounge.

751
00:35:49,547 --> 00:35:51,081
Are you all right?

752
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:52,682
Am I all right? Yeah.

753
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:59,372
You lost that shine in
your eyes. I liked that shine.

754
00:35:59,441 --> 00:36:01,057
I'm fine. I'm shiny.

755
00:36:04,363 --> 00:36:08,465
All right, I just played a private
concert for you with my brain open.

756
00:36:09,801 --> 00:36:11,551
I think you can
give me something.

757
00:36:11,619 --> 00:36:14,699
I got screwed over by
a friend today. That's all.

758
00:36:14,723 --> 00:36:16,243
The redhead? Mmm.

759
00:36:16,825 --> 00:36:17,857
That sucks.

760
00:36:18,927 --> 00:36:20,760
Mmm-hmm.

761
00:36:20,829 --> 00:36:23,997
When I started playing, I
had all these musician friends,

762
00:36:24,066 --> 00:36:26,916
and, you know, we'd
hang, and we'd jam together.

763
00:36:26,985 --> 00:36:28,851
We grew up together, you know.

764
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:31,587
And then I started booking
gigs, selling out those gigs,

765
00:36:31,656 --> 00:36:35,525
and, you know, I had the fans
and the girls, and it was fantastic.

766
00:36:35,594 --> 00:36:36,988
It was everything
we had hoped for.

767
00:36:37,012 --> 00:36:39,378
It was everything we had
talked about, you know?

768
00:36:41,783 --> 00:36:44,550
And then when I went
to share it with them,

769
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:46,937
they weren't there. All
my friends were gone.

770
00:36:46,988 --> 00:36:49,989
Poof. Just like that. It turns
out they weren't my friends.

771
00:36:51,092 --> 00:36:52,212
They were my competition.

772
00:36:57,382 --> 00:36:58,581
You and I are a lot alike.

773
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:00,483
Okay, how is that?

774
00:37:01,186 --> 00:37:02,218
Well, you're smart,

775
00:37:03,388 --> 00:37:04,904
incredibly good-looking.

776
00:37:04,973 --> 00:37:06,105
Cocky.

777
00:37:06,174 --> 00:37:09,075
But with the
goods to back it up.

778
00:37:09,144 --> 00:37:11,311
Now, if you'll excuse
me, I'm gonna go to sleep

779
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,663
'cause my head hurts.

780
00:37:14,532 --> 00:37:16,265
I'm supposed to watch you.

781
00:37:16,334 --> 00:37:17,400
I'm okay with that.

782
00:37:30,682 --> 00:37:32,014
I had a crappy day.

783
00:37:32,084 --> 00:37:33,516
Mmm. Me, too.

784
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:35,618
I found out why
Owen hates Riggs.

785
00:37:35,671 --> 00:37:37,687
I don't want to know. Okay.

786
00:37:38,523 --> 00:37:39,655
Do I want to know?

787
00:37:39,724 --> 00:37:41,207
I'm here.

788
00:37:41,276 --> 00:37:42,475
We can see that.

789
00:37:43,745 --> 00:37:45,589
Really, with the
cabinets? Sorry.

790
00:37:45,613 --> 00:37:47,797
You open, you close.
It's not that big a deal.

791
00:37:47,866 --> 00:37:48,932
It's tedious.

792
00:37:49,001 --> 00:37:50,962
Oh, my God, I was
promised sisters.

793
00:37:50,986 --> 00:37:53,114
I just got you guys
back in the same house.

794
00:37:53,138 --> 00:37:56,384
I've never had sisters. It's
nice, but it's going to implode.

795
00:37:56,408 --> 00:37:59,309
You know it, and I
know it, so have at it.

796
00:38:00,512 --> 00:38:02,245
Go to town over the cabinets.

797
00:38:02,314 --> 00:38:04,480
If you're gonna kill each
other, just do it already.

798
00:38:04,549 --> 00:38:06,260
I can't keep this family
together by myself.

799
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:07,928
Nobody asked you to.

800
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:09,363
We're adults.
We're going to fight.

801
00:38:09,387 --> 00:38:11,003
A lot. I'm annoying.

802
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:13,272
She is.

803
00:38:13,341 --> 00:38:15,185
But I don't plan on kicking
her out anytime soon,

804
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:17,427
so are you good?

805
00:38:17,495 --> 00:38:19,696
I'm not homeless. I'm good.

806
00:38:19,764 --> 00:38:21,063
Good.

807
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:23,466
Though Maggie is starting
to get on my nerves.

808
00:38:23,535 --> 00:38:25,001
Agreed.

809
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:27,520
Well, you wanted
sisters. You got them.

810
00:38:28,857 --> 00:38:30,097
Close the cabinet.

811
00:38:39,184 --> 00:38:41,429
I was just on my
way to your place.

812
00:38:41,453 --> 00:38:43,853
I really don't have time for
one of your lectures now, Mom.

813
00:38:43,922 --> 00:38:46,167
No, I was coming to
say that I was sorry,

814
00:38:46,191 --> 00:38:48,491
to apologize.

815
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,560
I doubt that.

816
00:38:49,611 --> 00:38:50,977
No, let me finish.

817
00:38:51,045 --> 00:38:54,263
I overstepped, but
you are my baby,

818
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:56,427
and if somebody messes
with you, watch out.

819
00:38:56,451 --> 00:39:00,720
I... Well, I was just
protecting my baby.

820
00:39:00,789 --> 00:39:03,167
You know I'm a grown-ass
man, right? Language.

821
00:39:03,191 --> 00:39:06,726
As long as I'm living, my
baby forever you will be.

822
00:39:09,481 --> 00:39:12,615
But I do need to let go.

823
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:14,217
Roots, wings.

824
00:39:14,286 --> 00:39:15,785
You can fight your own battles.

825
00:39:15,854 --> 00:39:17,437
Yes, I can.

826
00:39:17,506 --> 00:39:19,738
And if you don't want
to fight April on this,

827
00:39:19,807 --> 00:39:21,524
maybe there is another way.

828
00:39:21,593 --> 00:39:23,042
I mean, we're still all family.

829
00:39:23,111 --> 00:39:24,627
Maybe you can go to counseling,

830
00:39:24,696 --> 00:39:26,073
or I could get the two of
you in a room together,

831
00:39:26,097 --> 00:39:27,458
and we could...

832
00:39:27,482 --> 00:39:29,248
Sorry.

833
00:39:29,317 --> 00:39:31,877
This is gonna
take some practice.

834
00:39:32,921 --> 00:39:34,870
Honey, what are you going to do?

835
00:39:34,939 --> 00:39:36,872
I'm an Avery.

836
00:39:36,941 --> 00:39:40,461
Somebody messed with my
baby, so I got myself some power.

837
00:39:54,609 --> 00:39:57,849
I'll round on Jenny in the
morning after you've been in.

838
00:40:00,065 --> 00:40:01,814
All right, good night.

839
00:40:01,883 --> 00:40:05,534
I think Jackson's gonna
sue me for custody,

840
00:40:05,603 --> 00:40:08,237
full custody once
the baby's born.

841
00:40:08,306 --> 00:40:10,807
His mother, she is awful.

842
00:40:10,875 --> 00:40:13,275
I overheard her saying
it, and I just want to...

843
00:40:13,344 --> 00:40:19,148
I am so mad. I am furious.

844
00:40:19,216 --> 00:40:21,584
I feel like my skin is on fire!

845
00:40:21,653 --> 00:40:23,202
Oh, my God.

846
00:40:23,271 --> 00:40:25,939
Sorry, I know. I'm ranting, but
I don't have anyone to talk to,

847
00:40:26,007 --> 00:40:27,351
and I need to talk
to someone. No!

848
00:40:27,375 --> 00:40:29,420
And I've been treating
you like crap. No, no, no!

849
00:40:29,444 --> 00:40:32,278
You need to talk
to me. It's fine.

850
00:40:32,346 --> 00:40:37,734
I'm here for whatever you
need 'cause we're friends.

851
00:40:37,803 --> 00:40:41,787
Rant away, and then
we'll think about what to do.

852
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:45,391
I already thought of what to do.

853
00:40:46,928 --> 00:40:48,460
I'm not gonna be the victim.

854
00:40:49,931 --> 00:40:50,964
He can't do this.

855
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,699
I won't let him.

856
00:40:54,903 --> 00:40:56,286
April, what did you do?

857
00:40:56,354 --> 00:40:58,266
<i>What happens when
the gloves come off</i>

858
00:40:58,290 --> 00:41:00,322
<i>and you stop hiding
behind your mask?</i>

859
00:41:02,026 --> 00:41:04,810
I just don't want to hurt her.

860
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:06,924
You know, it's in
my power not to, so...

861
00:41:06,948 --> 00:41:08,414
Here's to that.

862
00:41:08,483 --> 00:41:09,960
Do you need a drink?

863
00:41:09,984 --> 00:41:11,512
Hey, Dr. Avery! Yeah.

864
00:41:11,536 --> 00:41:13,435
Dr. Jackson Avery?

865
00:41:13,504 --> 00:41:15,744
That's right. Do we...
You've been served.

866
00:41:16,624 --> 00:41:17,640
Have a good night, guys.

867
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:21,460
<i>What's your next move?</i>

868
00:41:21,529 --> 00:41:24,563
<i>Do you take your best
shot and see where it lands?</i>

869
00:41:31,923 --> 00:41:33,856
<i>Or do you hang
back, wait a minute,</i>

870
00:41:33,925 --> 00:41:35,805
<i>and see if you get
sucker-punched?</i>

871
00:41:42,633 --> 00:41:46,703
"I don't want to fight. Whatever
you want to do, we'll do."

872
00:41:46,771 --> 00:41:48,420
<i>It's your move.</i>

873
00:41:50,041 --> 00:41:51,207
Oh, no.

874
00:41:54,745 --> 00:41:55,878
A restraining order.

875
00:41:57,114 --> 00:41:59,894
April filed a restraining
order against me.

876
00:42:01,452 --> 00:42:04,132
<i>You can either retreat
or go out swinging.</i>

877
00:42:04,789 --> 00:42:06,205
<i>So what you gonna do?</i>
