1
00:00:01,168 --> 00:00:02,846
<i>Previously on</i> Grey's Anatomy...

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:04,385
Goodbye, Derek.

3
00:00:04,455 --> 00:00:06,232
- Right, Meredith.
- What do we got?

4
00:00:06,256 --> 00:00:09,296
Katie Bryce, 15-year-old
female, new onset seizures.

5
00:00:09,377 --> 00:00:11,287
Katie belongs to the new
attending now, Dr. Shepherd.

6
00:00:11,311 --> 00:00:12,438
It's a subarachnoid hemorrhage.

7
00:00:12,462 --> 00:00:14,012
She's bleeding into her brain.

8
00:00:14,081 --> 00:00:16,643
You earned the right to follow
her case through to the finish.

9
00:00:16,667 --> 00:00:19,484
I will discover that I am not
just the other Dr. Shepherd.

10
00:00:19,553 --> 00:00:20,919
<i>I'm the wrong Dr. Shepherd.</i>

11
00:00:20,988 --> 00:00:23,038
I'm just not ready
to forgive you yet.

12
00:00:23,107 --> 00:00:24,634
Looking sharp.
You got a hot date?

13
00:00:24,658 --> 00:00:26,152
<i>Uh, yeah, something like that.</i>

14
00:00:26,176 --> 00:00:28,176
When we're alone, she's
so... She's a wildcat, huh?

15
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:31,220
Richard. Pierce.

16
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:34,594
Do you really want this?

17
00:00:34,618 --> 00:00:36,629
This is one of the
simpler divorces I've seen.

18
00:00:36,653 --> 00:00:39,265
You just signed divorce papers,
and you don't want a drink?

19
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:41,701
What are you... What
are you, pregnant?

20
00:00:41,725 --> 00:00:42,991
I think I am.

21
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:49,882
<i>"Any day where no
one died is a good day."</i>

22
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:51,950
<i>Someone said that once.</i>

23
00:00:52,019 --> 00:00:54,169
<i>Wait. It was me. I said it.</i>

24
00:00:55,623 --> 00:00:57,356
<i>Any day you wake up...</i>

25
00:01:00,994 --> 00:01:03,061
<i>And your body's still moving...</i>

26
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:04,563
<i>Is a good day.</i>

27
00:01:05,432 --> 00:01:06,732
Keys. Where are my keys?

28
00:01:06,801 --> 00:01:08,801
Did you check in
your jacket pockets?

29
00:01:17,978 --> 00:01:19,578
<i>You can start over.</i>

30
00:01:19,646 --> 00:01:21,006
Found them!

31
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:25,166
<i>You can forget
your past mistakes.</i>

32
00:01:25,235 --> 00:01:27,619
<i>You can make a new start.</i>

33
00:01:27,688 --> 00:01:30,205
<i>Live every day
like it's your last.</i>

34
00:01:30,273 --> 00:01:32,474
<i>All that crap they put on
pillows and car bumpers...</i>

35
00:01:32,543 --> 00:01:33,587
Sorry.

36
00:01:33,611 --> 00:01:34,676
<i>It's all true.</i>

37
00:01:34,745 --> 00:01:35,794
Guys!

38
00:01:35,846 --> 00:01:37,278
<i>You're alive.</i>

39
00:01:37,348 --> 00:01:38,830
<i>Respect that.</i>

40
00:01:38,883 --> 00:01:40,148
<i>Not everybody is.</i>

41
00:01:41,685 --> 00:01:44,118
This room is full
of dead people.

42
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:46,204
I know it's easy to
forget, but come on.

43
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:47,840
Something happened to them,

44
00:01:47,908 --> 00:01:52,510
a mistake, a disease,
a stupid twist of fate.

45
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:55,780
They left their bodies
here for us to learn from,

46
00:01:56,567 --> 00:01:58,667
to become better.

47
00:01:58,736 --> 00:02:01,069
Let's have a little respect.

48
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,163
Time of death, 8:12.

49
00:02:13,183 --> 00:02:15,583
Keps, call the
plumber, would you?

50
00:02:15,652 --> 00:02:16,751
Sure.

51
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:21,834
Did he really just call
the morgue "the plumber"?

52
00:02:21,858 --> 00:02:23,959
Oh! Yeah. That's
something we say over there.

53
00:02:24,028 --> 00:02:26,273
They circle the drain, then
they clog it. "Call the plumber."

54
00:02:26,297 --> 00:02:28,057
Hunt's right. We hate that guy.

55
00:02:28,966 --> 00:02:30,698
Hey, you got a minute?

56
00:02:30,768 --> 00:02:33,051
Hi, yeah. What's up?

57
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,588
Um... Listen, I just got
our last joint cell phone bill,

58
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:38,284
and I'm pretty sure they
still charged your card,

59
00:02:38,308 --> 00:02:39,485
so I just want to
write you a check.

60
00:02:39,509 --> 00:02:40,720
It's fine. No, no, no.

61
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:41,777
You shouldn't have to...

62
00:02:41,862 --> 00:02:43,845
No, seriously,
Jackson. It's fine.

63
00:02:44,764 --> 00:02:46,064
If you're sure...

64
00:02:46,116 --> 00:02:47,356
This one's on me.

65
00:02:48,135 --> 00:02:49,367
Okay.

66
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:55,740
You have to tell him.

67
00:02:55,809 --> 00:02:57,659
Why? "Why"?

68
00:02:57,727 --> 00:02:59,377
So he'll come back to me?

69
00:02:59,446 --> 00:03:01,191
He doesn't want to be married.

70
00:03:01,215 --> 00:03:02,626
A baby wasn't gonna change
that. It shouldn't change that.

71
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:05,167
Because it's his
baby. Because he...

72
00:03:05,235 --> 00:03:06,534
I know. I know.

73
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:09,582
But I am happy for
the first time in a year.

74
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:11,901
And as soon as I tell him,
everything's gonna get all complicated.

75
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:14,092
And for right now...

76
00:03:14,161 --> 00:03:17,095
Obviously, obviously
I'm going to tell him.

77
00:03:17,764 --> 00:03:19,164
When I'm ready.

78
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:27,072
Oh! Hi. Hi.

79
00:03:30,443 --> 00:03:32,677
You're only wearing one boot.

80
00:03:32,746 --> 00:03:35,024
I know. I was late. And I
couldn't find the other one.

81
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,048
Amelia.

82
00:03:36,116 --> 00:03:37,348
Ah!

83
00:03:37,418 --> 00:03:39,262
You think I'm bootless
'cause I'm drunk.

84
00:03:39,286 --> 00:03:40,780
It's fine. I'm not drunk.

85
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:42,281
I just got my 60-day chip.

86
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:45,606
I am bootless because
I had sex with Owen,

87
00:03:45,675 --> 00:03:47,370
and his stupid
trailer is very dark.

88
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:49,705
And I was very late
because of the sex,

89
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:52,013
which was so great.

90
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:54,127
So I just thought, "Screw it."

91
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:55,528
I may not know where my boot is,

92
00:03:55,552 --> 00:03:57,097
but it's gonna be a great day.

93
00:03:57,121 --> 00:03:58,854
I hate you. Don't hate.

94
00:03:58,939 --> 00:04:00,621
I haven't had sex in days.

95
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:04,142
DeLuca and I almost
got caught by Webber.

96
00:04:04,194 --> 00:04:05,227
By Webber?

97
00:04:05,295 --> 00:04:07,329
So we had to cool
it in the hospital.

98
00:04:07,398 --> 00:04:08,563
And he's never got time.

99
00:04:08,631 --> 00:04:10,348
Interns never have
any freaking time.

100
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:12,433
So I never have sex.

101
00:04:12,503 --> 00:04:14,202
I know where all my boots are.

102
00:04:14,288 --> 00:04:15,598
Why me? I don't know.

103
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:18,856
Webber just said
he wanted you today.

104
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:22,860
You know, every year, Webber
singles out one intern to be his guy.

105
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,340
My first year here, it was me.

106
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:25,941
He called us the Big Dogs.

107
00:04:25,965 --> 00:04:27,666
Okay, well, why me, though?

108
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:29,011
Are you complaining right now?

109
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:30,246
Because this is an honor.

110
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,936
You have been anointed.

111
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:34,016
Webber is on top
of his own service.

112
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,308
You just listen and
learn from a master.

113
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:37,987
You have got the golden ticket,

114
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:39,177
my friend.

115
00:04:39,245 --> 00:04:41,258
Dr. Webber. Here's your guy.

116
00:04:41,282 --> 00:04:42,522
Good morning, sir.

117
00:04:42,565 --> 00:04:44,010
I'm, uh... I'm
really excited to...

118
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:45,082
You look tired.

119
00:04:45,669 --> 00:04:46,885
A late night?

120
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:48,364
No, sir, I...

121
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:50,305
I have a consult with Robbins.

122
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:51,501
Great. Let's get started.

123
00:04:51,525 --> 00:04:53,207
Okay. You can do
rounds on my post-ops.

124
00:04:53,276 --> 00:04:54,771
I've got a stack of
intern applications

125
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:56,177
on my desk that need filing.

126
00:04:56,246 --> 00:04:58,997
3316 needs her drain checked,

127
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:01,699
and 1242 could
use a rectal exam.

128
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:03,008
Okay.

129
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:05,136
Oh! Um... You know,
actually, DeLuca...

130
00:05:05,205 --> 00:05:06,365
Yes, sir.

131
00:05:06,924 --> 00:05:08,123
What's this?

132
00:05:08,191 --> 00:05:10,542
Dry cleaning.
Address is on the card.

133
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:19,484
Edwards! Morning.

134
00:05:19,553 --> 00:05:21,653
Uh, Pit's called for a consult.

135
00:05:21,722 --> 00:05:23,287
I rounded on all
of your post-ops.

136
00:05:23,356 --> 00:05:25,657
Four aneurysm
repairs, all doing fine.

137
00:05:25,726 --> 00:05:27,792
Mr. Klein is awake
and responsive.

138
00:05:27,861 --> 00:05:29,856
What's the matter with you?

139
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,591
Nothing. Edwards.

140
00:05:31,615 --> 00:05:33,482
It's all good.

141
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:35,462
It is a great day, and you are
bringing me down, Edwards.

142
00:05:35,486 --> 00:05:36,646
Spill it.

143
00:05:37,938 --> 00:05:40,688
It's like we're in a rut
of clipping aneurysms

144
00:05:40,758 --> 00:05:43,375
'cause that is all we do.

145
00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:46,894
It would be nice to throw a
glioma in there once in a while.

146
00:05:46,964 --> 00:05:49,208
You're hoping for someone
to have a brain tumor?

147
00:05:49,232 --> 00:05:50,665
Just to mix it up a little.

148
00:05:50,733 --> 00:05:52,028
Because you're
bored of aneurysms.

149
00:05:52,052 --> 00:05:53,467
I'm not complaining. I'm just...

150
00:05:53,554 --> 00:05:55,434
You are. But I'll tell you what,

151
00:05:55,472 --> 00:05:57,701
if you are so bored, the next
aneurysm that walks through that door,

152
00:05:57,725 --> 00:05:58,785
you will clip it yourself.

153
00:05:58,809 --> 00:06:00,742
Are you serious?

154
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:03,628
Are you serious?

155
00:06:04,915 --> 00:06:06,514
Okay, we'll take
you up for a scan,

156
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:08,260
and then we'll figure
out what's going on.

157
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:10,418
Yeah, sit tight. Don't worry.

158
00:06:11,221 --> 00:06:12,461
Her baby's fine.

159
00:06:12,489 --> 00:06:14,100
Yeah, I'm betting it's
an appendicitis. Mmm.

160
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:15,256
Yeah.

161
00:06:15,325 --> 00:06:17,993
So, how'd it go? Hmm?

162
00:06:18,061 --> 00:06:20,194
You left the bar with
the girl in the jean jacket.

163
00:06:20,263 --> 00:06:22,597
I would have put you with
crop top. She looked smart.

164
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:25,767
I mean, so how was
it? Did you hit it off?

165
00:06:25,836 --> 00:06:27,201
Oh! Um...

166
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:28,986
It was fine.

167
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:30,822
Fine? Yeah.

168
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:32,723
Fine.

169
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:35,660
Fine?

170
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:39,364
Patient's 25, complaining
of new onset headache,

171
00:06:39,433 --> 00:06:41,711
transient numbness
on the left side.

172
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:43,747
She passed out in
gymnastics practice.

173
00:06:43,771 --> 00:06:44,981
Do you know what I'm thinking?

174
00:06:45,005 --> 00:06:46,182
You're thinking
it's an aneurysm.

175
00:06:46,206 --> 00:06:47,572
I'm thinking it's my aneurysm.

176
00:06:47,641 --> 00:06:49,318
It could be a tumor.
Don't say that.

177
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:51,254
This morning, you
were praying for a tumor.

178
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:54,845
Hi. Katie.

179
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:57,048
Who are you? I asked
for Dr. Shepherd.

180
00:06:57,117 --> 00:06:58,883
And here I am.

181
00:06:58,952 --> 00:07:01,519
No, you're not.
Dr. Shepherd is a guy.

182
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:03,304
Ah.

183
00:07:03,373 --> 00:07:05,323
Look, I was here
before, years ago.

184
00:07:05,392 --> 00:07:08,943
My First year. My first day.

185
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:11,579
Subarachnoid hemorrhage.
You're Katie Bryce.

186
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,667
IV lost en route,

187
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:17,718
started grand mal
seizing as we descended.

188
00:07:17,805 --> 00:07:19,215
All right, get her on her side.

189
00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:20,799
And I didn't get stuck
with someone this clueless,

190
00:07:20,823 --> 00:07:22,974
and that was, like, a nurse.

191
00:07:23,043 --> 00:07:24,859
Oh, my God.

192
00:07:24,928 --> 00:07:26,911
They still let you
be a doctor here?

193
00:07:37,057 --> 00:07:38,457
So, let me get this straight.

194
00:07:38,525 --> 00:07:40,425
I had a thing.
You guys fixed it.

195
00:07:40,494 --> 00:07:43,027
Now the symptoms
are back and worse.

196
00:07:43,096 --> 00:07:45,296
I mean, I'm not
having seizures yet,

197
00:07:45,365 --> 00:07:47,315
but I keep going
numb, and my head...

198
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:48,384
Well...

199
00:07:48,452 --> 00:07:49,629
We're not exactly
sure what we're

200
00:07:49,653 --> 00:07:51,018
dealing with, Katie.

201
00:07:51,087 --> 00:07:53,771
I was going to say your
prelim neuro looks good.

202
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,574
The symptoms are
different from last time.

203
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:57,776
For the record,

204
00:07:57,844 --> 00:07:59,355
I don't want to go
through that again.

205
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:00,612
You shaved my head.

206
00:08:00,681 --> 00:08:02,201
I was, like, an
ug-mo troll for weeks

207
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:03,672
until I could get
extensions going.

208
00:08:03,734 --> 00:08:05,416
Did you guys screw
this up last time?

209
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:06,584
Found it.

210
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:07,663
It's so old it's not
even in the computer.

211
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:09,270
Webber had to show me

212
00:08:09,356 --> 00:08:10,488
the archive room.

213
00:08:10,557 --> 00:08:12,335
You still doing pageants, Katie?

214
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:14,559
What was it,
rhythmic gymnastics?

215
00:08:14,628 --> 00:08:15,726
Nope. Stopped those.

216
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:17,562
Pageants got me a
full ride to UW, though.

217
00:08:17,631 --> 00:08:19,114
And now I coach gymnastics.

218
00:08:19,182 --> 00:08:20,999
Two of my girls are
Olympic qualifiers.

219
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:23,201
Wow. Impressive.

220
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:25,954
No offense, but are you
gonna be operating on me?

221
00:08:26,023 --> 00:08:29,040
Dr. Grey is not a neurosurgeon.

222
00:08:29,109 --> 00:08:30,125
Good.

223
00:08:30,193 --> 00:08:31,437
I mean, she was
kind of a train wreck.

224
00:08:31,461 --> 00:08:32,894
She kept getting me lost.

225
00:08:34,114 --> 00:08:35,680
It was my first day.

226
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,400
Hey, Katie Bryce is back.

227
00:08:38,468 --> 00:08:39,579
Katie who?

228
00:08:39,603 --> 00:08:40,735
Katie Bryce.

229
00:08:40,804 --> 00:08:43,337
Day one of my internship,
mystery seizures,

230
00:08:43,406 --> 00:08:45,473
Cristina and I solved
it, Derek operated.

231
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:46,941
It was my first surgery, Bailey.

232
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:48,776
How do you not remember this?

233
00:08:48,845 --> 00:08:51,285
You were an intern, Grey. You
weren't even a person to me yet.

234
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:54,927
Okay. So, what
do you think it is?

235
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:56,462
A re-bleed or...
I don't know yet.

236
00:08:56,486 --> 00:08:58,135
It feels like a tumor.

237
00:08:58,204 --> 00:08:59,604
Could be a re-bleed

238
00:08:59,656 --> 00:09:01,589
or the clip slipped.

239
00:09:01,658 --> 00:09:03,502
Well, I watched Derek place
the clip. The clip didn't slip.

240
00:09:03,526 --> 00:09:05,310
Meredith, clips slip.

241
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:06,644
Yeah, I'll get her to CT.

242
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:08,725
Order an angio, too,
based on her history.

243
00:09:08,749 --> 00:09:09,931
Meredith.

244
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,066
What?

245
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:12,762
She's my patient. She came back.

246
00:09:12,786 --> 00:09:15,286
She was Derek's
patient. Now she's mine.

247
00:09:15,355 --> 00:09:16,904
Oh, Katie Bryce!

248
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:19,085
When Derek had
all of the interns

249
00:09:19,109 --> 00:09:20,253
chasing their tail
for the answer...

250
00:09:20,277 --> 00:09:21,426
Yes!

251
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:24,423
And he was chasing
your tail? Yes.

252
00:09:24,447 --> 00:09:25,792
I'm gonna stay with you on this.

253
00:09:25,816 --> 00:09:27,115
Mer, I have it.

254
00:09:27,184 --> 00:09:28,927
My name is on the chart. I
need to make sure that we...

255
00:09:28,951 --> 00:09:31,202
I will update you.

256
00:09:31,271 --> 00:09:33,048
I'm gonna go discharge
a cancer patient.

257
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:34,572
I will be back.

258
00:09:34,641 --> 00:09:36,006
Counting the minutes.

259
00:09:38,178 --> 00:09:39,443
Daphne.

260
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:41,545
You hitting the books?

261
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:43,481
Yeah, I have to. I
have finals on Monday.

262
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:45,951
Physics. I loved physics.

263
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:48,135
Yeah. It would have
been easier when I was 20.

264
00:09:48,205 --> 00:09:49,448
Well, but you're starting over.

265
00:09:49,472 --> 00:09:51,100
It's impressive.
Starting over is hard.

266
00:09:51,124 --> 00:09:52,624
String theory is harder.

267
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:56,928
But I pass this, I graduate
in June with honors.

268
00:09:56,997 --> 00:09:59,814
Okay. You want to tell
her how she did here?

269
00:09:59,883 --> 00:10:02,733
Flying colors. All your
follow-up labs came back clear.

270
00:10:02,803 --> 00:10:04,948
Dr. Grey got all the
mets off your liver.

271
00:10:04,972 --> 00:10:06,871
No recurrence. So...

272
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,167
So, after 10 months...

273
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:09,191
Say it.

274
00:10:09,259 --> 00:10:11,426
You're cancer-free. Yes!

275
00:10:11,494 --> 00:10:13,445
Thank you! Thank you so much!

276
00:10:13,513 --> 00:10:15,553
Of course. Oh, man.

277
00:10:15,582 --> 00:10:18,332
Okay, so, now are
you going to call David?

278
00:10:19,135 --> 00:10:20,285
You're a nag.

279
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:22,553
I kicked your cancer.
We had a deal.

280
00:10:23,573 --> 00:10:24,605
I need another month.

281
00:10:24,674 --> 00:10:26,624
One more month,
and I get my diploma.

282
00:10:26,693 --> 00:10:27,933
Also, one more round of chemo,

283
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:29,404
and then they take
my headphone jack out.

284
00:10:29,428 --> 00:10:30,428
And then I will.

285
00:10:30,497 --> 00:10:32,537
How long's the
redness been there?

286
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:34,565
I don't know. A week.

287
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,929
All right, put the books down.
I need to take a look at that.

288
00:10:36,953 --> 00:10:39,654
Damn it! I was
almost out of here.

289
00:10:45,345 --> 00:10:46,794
Hey. Hey.

290
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:53,968
So the ring is in your drawer.

291
00:10:54,036 --> 00:10:55,069
Yeah.

292
00:10:56,273 --> 00:10:58,117
What are you gonna do with it?

293
00:10:58,141 --> 00:10:59,861
Well, what do you
mean? It's in my drawer.

294
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:01,687
Are you gonna take it back?

295
00:11:01,711 --> 00:11:03,311
Do you want me to take it back?

296
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:04,540
Well, it was...

297
00:11:04,564 --> 00:11:06,825
It was probably
expensive. It was.

298
00:11:06,849 --> 00:11:09,984
And, uh, it's not doing anyone
any good in your drawer.

299
00:11:10,052 --> 00:11:12,220
Yeah, well, I didn't
buy it for the drawer.

300
00:11:12,288 --> 00:11:14,289
Look, you didn't say yes or no.

301
00:11:14,357 --> 00:11:16,524
Is this no? Is that
what you're saying?

302
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:17,608
No.

303
00:11:17,678 --> 00:11:19,310
"No," like, "no"?

304
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:21,195
Or, "no," like, "not no"?

305
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:23,184
I...

306
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,999
I don't know.

307
00:11:25,068 --> 00:11:26,867
This was great!

308
00:11:28,905 --> 00:11:31,589
Hey. The scans back
on our appendix yet?

309
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:36,444
Robbins, we've been
at this for a while.

310
00:11:36,513 --> 00:11:37,545
What?

311
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:39,258
I have facilitated
in the introduction

312
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:41,227
of over a dozen women for you.

313
00:11:41,251 --> 00:11:44,013
Mmm-hmm. I mean, I'm
invested in this project.

314
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:47,205
So when the results
we're getting are "fine,"

315
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:48,573
we can do better than that.

316
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:52,610
Um... It was... It
was better than fine.

317
00:11:52,678 --> 00:11:54,178
It was...

318
00:11:55,682 --> 00:11:57,097
You don't want
to hear about this.

319
00:11:57,167 --> 00:11:59,811
No, no, no, I think feedback
is crucial to our success.

320
00:11:59,835 --> 00:12:01,920
That way we can
course correct if need be.

321
00:12:01,972 --> 00:12:04,088
It was way better than fine.

322
00:12:04,157 --> 00:12:07,992
It turns out that she's in real
estate and an insanely good kisser.

323
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:09,493
And she...

324
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:11,574
I mean, she knows her way
around the neighborhood.

325
00:12:11,598 --> 00:12:13,514
Oh! Where'd you go? Everywhere.

326
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:15,183
If you know what I'm saying.

327
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:19,653
From the hills to the low
country and all around downtown.

328
00:12:19,722 --> 00:12:21,033
Ah. I get... Yeah, yeah.

329
00:12:21,057 --> 00:12:22,290
Oh, my... I'm sorry.

330
00:12:22,359 --> 00:12:23,469
I got carried away.
No, no, I asked.

331
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:24,637
Thought that you wanted to know.

332
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:26,701
I asked. Scans are ready.

333
00:12:29,098 --> 00:12:31,159
I rounded on your
post-ops, got your labs back,

334
00:12:31,183 --> 00:12:33,629
filed the intern applications,
and picked up your dry cleaning.

335
00:12:33,653 --> 00:12:35,347
They got the stain out
of your purple sweater.

336
00:12:35,371 --> 00:12:36,611
Excellent.

337
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,484
Yeah, so, you were right
about the appendicitis.

338
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:41,809
All right, DeLuca, you can go
get my surgery transcriptions.

339
00:12:41,877 --> 00:12:43,127
Yes, sir.

340
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:46,898
Oh.

341
00:12:46,967 --> 00:12:48,516
Hey, what's wrong with you?

342
00:12:48,585 --> 00:12:49,884
Me? Oh, I'm fine.

343
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:52,453
I just never got
time to eat today.

344
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:53,522
Richard.

345
00:12:54,574 --> 00:12:55,673
Don't kill the interns.

346
00:12:56,292 --> 00:12:57,392
DeLuca, go eat.

347
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:59,180
Quickly. Thank you.

348
00:13:01,831 --> 00:13:05,311
Did you know 8% of all
repaired aneurysm patients

349
00:13:05,335 --> 00:13:06,445
had a recurrence?

350
00:13:06,469 --> 00:13:07,568
It's gonna be a tumor.

351
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:10,521
Statistics say aneurysm.

352
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:12,068
Her symptoms say tumor.

353
00:13:12,092 --> 00:13:15,075
And if it is an aneurysm,
you said I could clip it.

354
00:13:15,162 --> 00:13:16,861
You said it's a great day.

355
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:20,064
And I agree with you, it
is a great day. I feel great.

356
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:22,850
Uh, so I will clip it, right?

357
00:13:23,486 --> 00:13:24,852
Hush.

358
00:13:29,926 --> 00:13:31,825
Crap. It's a tumor.

359
00:13:31,895 --> 00:13:35,480
No. It's an aneurysm.

360
00:13:35,549 --> 00:13:39,817
That's... That's an aneurysm?
I've never seen one that big.

361
00:13:39,886 --> 00:13:42,167
Yeah, I don't want to clip that.

362
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,588
Neither do I.

363
00:13:44,658 --> 00:13:46,024
It does look infected.

364
00:13:46,092 --> 00:13:48,370
It might be superficial,
but it needs to come out.

365
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:49,410
Lidocaine.

366
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:51,016
You should have come in sooner.

367
00:13:51,063 --> 00:13:52,441
I have a history paper
due on Wednesday.

368
00:13:52,465 --> 00:13:55,416
I'm supposed to blow
that off? Plus two jobs.

369
00:13:55,485 --> 00:13:57,845
I only fight cancer
on the weekends.

370
00:14:00,323 --> 00:14:02,251
So, there might be some
blood, but you can look away.

371
00:14:02,275 --> 00:14:05,109
Please, you guys have poked
and prodded me forever now.

372
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:11,999
Oh, my God,
that's a lot of blood.

373
00:14:12,085 --> 00:14:13,334
Let's page cardio.

374
00:14:13,402 --> 00:14:15,103
It's okay. That
doesn't look okay.

375
00:14:15,171 --> 00:14:17,055
I know. I know. It's scary.

376
00:14:17,107 --> 00:14:19,456
Daphne, look at me.

377
00:14:19,509 --> 00:14:20,875
You're okay.

378
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:30,462
That's normal? All that blood?

379
00:14:30,486 --> 00:14:32,586
Let's hang FFP, platelets,

380
00:14:32,655 --> 00:14:35,523
one gram of TXA,
and crossmatch her.

381
00:14:35,592 --> 00:14:37,691
Where is cardio?
Riggs is coming.

382
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,276
Ugh. Riggs.

383
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:41,695
Yes. "Ugh. Riggs" is here.

384
00:14:41,764 --> 00:14:43,998
Daphne, right? What do we got?

385
00:14:44,067 --> 00:14:46,634
Daphne's portacath got
infected, and when I removed it...

386
00:14:46,703 --> 00:14:47,885
It was a gusher, looks like.

387
00:14:47,954 --> 00:14:50,471
All right, I'll book an OR. No.

388
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:53,157
Daphne, I've given you some
medicine to help your blood clot,

389
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:56,160
so I'm just going to apply
pressure and wait for it to work.

390
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:57,406
Well, I think we
should move her,

391
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:59,096
get a good look at the vessels.

392
00:14:59,165 --> 00:15:00,609
Well, I'm hoping it
just resolves itself here

393
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:01,877
so we don't have to open
her up and make it worse.

394
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,095
So you're just gonna
keep holding pressure?

395
00:15:03,119 --> 00:15:05,953
That's the plan. Katie Bryce.

396
00:15:06,022 --> 00:15:08,489
Oh, you need to be
somewhere? I can do it.

397
00:15:08,558 --> 00:15:10,603
Are you leaving?
No, no, I'm here.

398
00:15:10,627 --> 00:15:12,426
It's just holding pressure.

399
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:13,927
She's my patient.

400
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:16,880
She's sort of my patient
now. It's a cardiac case.

401
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:18,349
You can wait if you like.

402
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:22,520
All right. We'll wait a
little while, and we'll see.

403
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,538
Blake, you need repeat
coags every 30 minutes.

404
00:15:24,624 --> 00:15:27,258
And push my chole
and cover my post-ops.

405
00:15:27,327 --> 00:15:31,012
And get an update on
Shepherd's patient Katie Bryce.

406
00:15:31,081 --> 00:15:33,998
Dr. Shepherd. Absolutely.

407
00:15:34,066 --> 00:15:35,600
Speak.

408
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:36,979
Dr. Grey was wondering if...

409
00:15:37,003 --> 00:15:38,180
Yeah, tell her
she's off the hook.

410
00:15:38,204 --> 00:15:39,381
It had nothing to
do with the old case.

411
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:40,866
Your original repair is fine.

412
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:42,723
Okay, great. This is new.

413
00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:44,392
It was a frontal lobe aneurysm,

414
00:15:44,477 --> 00:15:45,960
the biggest one
I have ever seen.

415
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:47,928
How big? Like...

416
00:15:49,215 --> 00:15:51,331
This isn't charades,
Blake. I need to see it.

417
00:15:51,401 --> 00:15:53,117
She just wants to
look at the scans.

418
00:15:53,186 --> 00:15:54,714
Then why doesn't she
come here and look at the...

419
00:15:54,738 --> 00:15:56,454
She's busy with a patient.

420
00:15:56,523 --> 00:15:58,071
You know what? So am I.

421
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:00,136
Tell her I don't have time
to give her computer access.

422
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,237
Tell her she doesn't
need to see the scan.

423
00:16:01,261 --> 00:16:03,181
Absolutely.

424
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,007
That's a monster.

425
00:16:05,031 --> 00:16:06,208
What's her approach?

426
00:16:06,232 --> 00:16:08,026
Is she going to clip it
or do a primary repair?

427
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,650
I don't think she's
gone that far yet.

428
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:10,784
Well, find out!

429
00:16:10,853 --> 00:16:12,770
Tell her if she
wants to talk to me,

430
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:14,872
she can come down
here and talk to me

431
00:16:14,941 --> 00:16:17,075
and not keep sending her mole.

432
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:18,287
Tell her, "Thank you, Meredith,

433
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:19,788
"for the overwhelming
vote of confidence,

434
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,723
"but I will use the
approach I deem necessary."

435
00:16:21,747 --> 00:16:23,080
And if she doesn't trust me,

436
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:25,999
she can come down here
and clip this thing herself.

437
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:28,719
And also, you can tell her to...

438
00:16:28,788 --> 00:16:31,038
Yeah, I don't want
to do this anymore.

439
00:16:31,107 --> 00:16:32,251
What is your problem
with Shepherd?

440
00:16:32,275 --> 00:16:34,359
Mind your business.

441
00:16:34,427 --> 00:16:35,738
I don't think she
likes you very much.

442
00:16:35,762 --> 00:16:37,306
Ooh, you picked up
on that, huh? All right.

443
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,413
All right.

444
00:16:38,481 --> 00:16:40,331
Go tell Shepherd...

445
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,750
Tell her to not screw it up.

446
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:46,621
I think she gets that.

447
00:16:46,689 --> 00:16:50,157
Ow, ow, ow, ow. All
right, a little more lidocaine.

448
00:16:50,226 --> 00:16:52,710
Ooh, maybe sailing.
Maybe I should get a boat.

449
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:54,856
That's too much upkeep.
Well, I need something, all right?

450
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,742
I feel like, you know,
it's a new chapter.

451
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:59,111
Start something new. I
need something that I can...

452
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:00,200
What about golf?

453
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:01,747
Nah, I think it's too
cliched, though...

454
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:03,221
Golfing doctors.

455
00:17:03,273 --> 00:17:04,667
What did you do with your ring?

456
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:06,619
Ow. Ow. A little
lighter. A little lighter.

457
00:17:06,643 --> 00:17:08,737
Um... I didn't know what to do
with it, so it's just in a drawer.

458
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:10,044
Right. It goes in a drawer.

459
00:17:10,113 --> 00:17:11,840
And if she didn't
say yes or no...

460
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,909
And April... I mean,
she's, like, fine.

461
00:17:13,933 --> 00:17:16,061
It's like she's
better than fine.

462
00:17:16,085 --> 00:17:17,463
You'd think that she was the one
that was pushing for the damn divorce.

463
00:17:17,487 --> 00:17:18,964
Sloan always
wanted me to try golf.

464
00:17:18,988 --> 00:17:20,220
I never liked golf.

465
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:21,305
Love golf.

466
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:22,756
Just don't try hockey. Ow!

467
00:17:22,825 --> 00:17:24,753
Jo doesn't know what she
wants. Neither does Amelia.

468
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:26,304
One day, she wants
to stop things cold,

469
00:17:26,328 --> 00:17:28,373
the next, she never
wants it to stop.

470
00:17:28,397 --> 00:17:31,093
If it keeps going like
this... It's all a lot of upkeep.

471
00:17:31,117 --> 00:17:32,177
If she didn't want
a ring on her finger,

472
00:17:32,201 --> 00:17:33,745
why does she care
what I do with it?

473
00:17:33,769 --> 00:17:36,548
Because it's just sitting in
that drawer like a loaded gun.

474
00:17:36,572 --> 00:17:38,417
And every time we
have sex or a fight,

475
00:17:38,441 --> 00:17:41,408
he could just pull it
out and point it at me.

476
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:43,044
Do you even want the ring?

477
00:17:43,112 --> 00:17:46,697
I don't want it... Right now.

478
00:17:48,334 --> 00:17:50,134
Grey and Shepherd
are gonna kill each other,

479
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:51,936
and I'm going to
die in the crossfire.

480
00:17:52,005 --> 00:17:53,966
Grey needs to chill 'cause
it's not even her case.

481
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:56,724
Shepherd could cut her
some slack. It was her case.

482
00:17:56,792 --> 00:17:59,232
It was supposed to be my case.

483
00:17:59,294 --> 00:18:00,956
Do you think I should
tell him to take it back?

484
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:03,548
Jo, you already did. If you
wanted it, you'd be wearing it.

485
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:06,795
I mean, are you doing all right?

486
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:08,263
'Cause after Arizona
and I got divorced,

487
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:11,172
it felt like my insides
were ripped out of me.

488
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:15,693
No. I mean...
Yeah, it was awful.

489
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:18,812
It was amicable, I
guess is the word.

490
00:18:18,881 --> 00:18:21,115
Civil and polite and awful.

491
00:18:21,184 --> 00:18:22,683
But, um, no.

492
00:18:22,751 --> 00:18:24,068
I, uh... I feel good.

493
00:18:25,454 --> 00:18:27,004
I feel really good.

494
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:32,538
You got divorced really
different from how I did.

495
00:18:43,889 --> 00:18:45,851
Hey, man, you got
to take this, okay?

496
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:48,308
No, no, just take
it. Just... Here.

497
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:05,971
You're exhausted. You're
not too exhausted, right?

498
00:19:05,995 --> 00:19:07,762
No. No. No. Okay.

499
00:19:17,373 --> 00:19:19,407
No! No!

500
00:19:20,927 --> 00:19:22,167
It's Webber.

501
00:19:22,211 --> 00:19:23,343
It's Webber?

502
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:25,490
Yeah, he's made me his guy now,

503
00:19:25,514 --> 00:19:29,583
which apparently means
relentless pages and endless scut.

504
00:19:29,652 --> 00:19:30,918
Webber has singled you out?

505
00:19:30,987 --> 00:19:32,931
Yeah, anointed me, apparently.

506
00:19:32,955 --> 00:19:34,621
Oh, okay. He knows about us.

507
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:36,240
No. No.

508
00:19:36,309 --> 00:19:37,869
Why would he make
me his guy, though?

509
00:19:37,893 --> 00:19:41,194
I don't know. Um,
he's my father.

510
00:19:41,264 --> 00:19:42,480
He's your what?

511
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:44,164
Yeah, maybe he doesn't know.

512
00:19:44,233 --> 00:19:45,861
You said your folks
are from Boston.

513
00:19:45,885 --> 00:19:47,668
Yeah, yeah, he's
my biological father.

514
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:49,053
Maggie, he's your father?

515
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:51,539
Maybe it's just a coincidence.

516
00:19:53,626 --> 00:19:55,008
Oh! I'm so screwed!

517
00:19:55,077 --> 00:19:56,777
No, no, I'll ask
him. I'll find out.

518
00:19:56,846 --> 00:19:59,886
No, Maggie. I told
him you were a wildcat.

519
00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:03,367
What? Why? Why
would you do that?

520
00:20:03,436 --> 00:20:04,676
Webber's your father?

521
00:20:06,506 --> 00:20:08,506
Hi. Ah.

522
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:09,740
What do you have?

523
00:20:09,809 --> 00:20:11,209
Mitral valve.

524
00:20:13,012 --> 00:20:14,461
I got Cross.

525
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:15,913
What about?

526
00:20:15,982 --> 00:20:19,542
No, I mean, my intern.
I got Cross today.

527
00:20:19,586 --> 00:20:23,287
He's pretty good.
A little green.

528
00:20:24,757 --> 00:20:26,924
Who have you got? Ah, DeLuca.

529
00:20:26,993 --> 00:20:28,425
Oh, you like him?

530
00:20:28,494 --> 00:20:30,827
I've only worked with
him a couple times.

531
00:20:30,897 --> 00:20:32,179
Yeah, he's an intern.

532
00:20:32,247 --> 00:20:34,198
You know, he shows potential.

533
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:35,377
Mmm-hmm.

534
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:37,885
You know, he's calm
in surgery. Steady.

535
00:20:37,953 --> 00:20:39,364
Yeah, he's got great hands.

536
00:20:39,388 --> 00:20:41,321
I beg your pardon?

537
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:44,641
In the OR. 'Cause he was an EMT.

538
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:46,744
I heard... Oh.

539
00:20:46,813 --> 00:20:48,023
I think. I guess.

540
00:20:48,047 --> 00:20:49,813
Um... Yeah, I think
I heard that, too.

541
00:20:49,882 --> 00:20:50,992
Yeah. Yeah.

542
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:53,295
He's a great roommate.
Dependable. Quiet.

543
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:54,969
What? DeLuca.

544
00:20:56,105 --> 00:20:57,282
Right.

545
00:20:57,306 --> 00:20:59,351
So, yeah, have
fun with him today.

546
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:01,692
Or... Have a good...

547
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,310
Yeah. Bye.

548
00:21:03,379 --> 00:21:05,162
Yeah. Bye. Yeah.

549
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:10,717
And these are the consent
forms. There you go.

550
00:21:10,786 --> 00:21:12,597
And this is a new one?

551
00:21:12,621 --> 00:21:13,820
Yes.

552
00:21:13,889 --> 00:21:15,256
And this one's bigger.

553
00:21:15,324 --> 00:21:18,208
It's a very thin,
fragile balloon.

554
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,794
Even the tiniest disturbance
walking around could pop it.

555
00:21:20,863 --> 00:21:22,346
And if it pops, I die?

556
00:21:23,733 --> 00:21:26,011
Why does this keep happening?

557
00:21:26,035 --> 00:21:27,368
You're predisposed to aneurysms.

558
00:21:27,437 --> 00:21:28,514
It's just something that...

559
00:21:28,538 --> 00:21:30,819
Dr. Shepherd fixed the last one.

560
00:21:31,641 --> 00:21:33,052
I know. The other Dr. Shepherd.

561
00:21:33,076 --> 00:21:34,558
He knew how to fix it.

562
00:21:36,445 --> 00:21:39,162
Your first aneurysm was
very difficult to diagnose,

563
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:40,731
but it was easy to solve.

564
00:21:41,567 --> 00:21:42,733
This one...

565
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:46,053
It's very risky.

566
00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:48,539
Are you saying you can't do it?

567
00:21:48,607 --> 00:21:50,657
I'm saying that I
will do my very best.

568
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:55,445
Katie.

569
00:21:56,849 --> 00:21:58,582
We have to try.

570
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:00,851
Otherwise... I know. I just...

571
00:22:02,187 --> 00:22:04,922
Are you as good as your brother?

572
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:06,231
Are you better than him?

573
00:22:13,932 --> 00:22:15,777
Camera scope seems jittery.

574
00:22:15,801 --> 00:22:17,801
Hold the damn
thing still, DeLuca.

575
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:20,030
Sorry, sir. I'm trying.

576
00:22:20,239 --> 00:22:21,254
"Great hands."

577
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:26,710
So, are you gonna be
seeing "Jean Jacket" again?

578
00:22:26,779 --> 00:22:28,223
No. Not her again.

579
00:22:28,247 --> 00:22:30,681
She was fun, but a little crazy.

580
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:32,816
"Hoop Earrings,"
maybe. She was funny.

581
00:22:32,885 --> 00:22:36,453
Tonight is, um, oh, "Artisanal
Soap." Remember her?

582
00:22:36,522 --> 00:22:37,921
You said she was ditzy.

583
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:41,052
Yeah, she was. But she
smelled like lilacs everywhere.

584
00:22:41,076 --> 00:22:43,961
Robbins, how many
women are you seeing?

585
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:45,907
Mmm, not that
many. Right, DeLuca?

586
00:22:45,931 --> 00:22:48,582
Hmm? Oh! I don't know.
I mean, who's counting?

587
00:22:50,052 --> 00:22:52,069
How would you know?
You're never there.

588
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:54,299
Mr. Secret Lover spends every
night at his girlfriend's place.

589
00:22:54,323 --> 00:22:55,455
That's not true.

590
00:22:55,524 --> 00:22:56,835
I told you. He's
the best roommate.

591
00:22:56,859 --> 00:22:58,658
He has a girlfriend
with her own place

592
00:22:58,745 --> 00:23:00,811
and clearly a crazy sex drive.

593
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,290
Is that the ileum
just above the...

594
00:23:02,314 --> 00:23:03,608
That's what that is.
ARIZONA: Oh, yeah.

595
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:05,194
He brought her
to our place once.

596
00:23:05,218 --> 00:23:06,350
Oh, my goodness.

597
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:07,979
I thought he was
killing her in there.

598
00:23:08,003 --> 00:23:09,519
She's a screamer.

599
00:23:09,588 --> 00:23:11,583
All right, that's enough!

600
00:23:11,607 --> 00:23:15,426
Can we focus on the base
of the appendix, please?

601
00:23:15,494 --> 00:23:16,494
Hmm.

602
00:23:21,634 --> 00:23:23,111
Here's her latest lab results.

603
00:23:23,135 --> 00:23:24,584
Do you want me
to book an OR now?

604
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:26,431
Septicemia. Pseudomonas.

605
00:23:26,455 --> 00:23:28,238
PCR positive times two.

606
00:23:28,307 --> 00:23:31,052
I can go in, try to get local
control, maybe subclavian repair.

607
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:33,905
Yeah, but she's got a possible
D-dimer with SIRS brewing.

608
00:23:33,929 --> 00:23:35,057
We may have to.

609
00:23:35,081 --> 00:23:36,991
I'm worried she may
not withstand GA, though.

610
00:23:37,015 --> 00:23:39,300
Do you want to
dumb it down a little?

611
00:23:39,368 --> 00:23:41,413
Okay, Daphne, your
portacath got infected,

612
00:23:41,437 --> 00:23:43,204
and it's caused sepsis.

613
00:23:43,272 --> 00:23:45,967
A big infection all over, which
can cause your organs to fail.

614
00:23:45,991 --> 00:23:49,476
If I take my hands off and
you're not bleeding, we're good.

615
00:23:50,896 --> 00:23:52,696
And if I do bleed?

616
00:23:52,765 --> 00:23:54,893
Then I have to take you into the
OR and try to stop the bleeding.

617
00:23:54,917 --> 00:23:56,061
But if Dr. Grey's right,

618
00:23:56,085 --> 00:23:58,165
the surgery could
make you worse.

619
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:01,371
I should have come in sooner.

620
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,784
Do you want to call David now?

621
00:24:02,808 --> 00:24:04,575
No. I screwed up again.

622
00:24:04,644 --> 00:24:07,084
Who's David? Your husband?

623
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,097
David is my son.

624
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,100
He was my son.

625
00:24:13,936 --> 00:24:16,236
I made a bad choice.

626
00:24:16,305 --> 00:24:17,721
I made lots of bad choices.

627
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:20,557
I chose all sorts
of things over him.

628
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:24,577
I left him.

629
00:24:24,646 --> 00:24:27,031
That was a long time ago.

630
00:24:27,099 --> 00:24:28,698
Six years.

631
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:31,168
He's 20 now. He's in college.

632
00:24:32,672 --> 00:24:34,437
He has another mother now.

633
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:37,552
And I'm just a mess.

634
00:24:37,576 --> 00:24:39,843
You're not. Not anymore.

635
00:24:41,163 --> 00:24:43,597
Call him. DAPHNE: Yeah.

636
00:24:43,665 --> 00:24:46,016
When I've cleaned
up my act, you know?

637
00:24:46,084 --> 00:24:47,618
I want to have my diploma.

638
00:24:47,687 --> 00:24:50,371
I want to show him that I can
be someone he can be proud of.

639
00:24:51,607 --> 00:24:54,508
Seems to me that
you already are.

640
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:55,787
Yeah, and then I got cancer.

641
00:24:55,811 --> 00:24:57,589
And that is not your fault.

642
00:24:57,613 --> 00:24:58,991
Daphne, you have earned this.

643
00:24:59,015 --> 00:25:01,915
I have watched you become
a completely different person.

644
00:25:01,984 --> 00:25:04,195
And he deserves to know you.

645
00:25:04,219 --> 00:25:05,586
Please call him.

646
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:09,656
No.

647
00:25:09,725 --> 00:25:12,392
I'm not going back to
him with more problems.

648
00:25:14,446 --> 00:25:16,613
Okay. Are you ready
to take a look now?

649
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:20,000
Let's just wait a little
while longer, just to be sure.

650
00:25:26,375 --> 00:25:28,608
Hey, you paged? What's that?

651
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:33,180
This was Derek's?

652
00:25:33,249 --> 00:25:34,915
Yeah.

653
00:25:34,984 --> 00:25:36,477
But that's not why I paged.

654
00:25:36,501 --> 00:25:38,547
I left a boot at your
place this morning.

655
00:25:38,571 --> 00:25:40,004
Yeah, yeah, I brought it in.

656
00:25:41,974 --> 00:25:44,241
It was wrong of me
to come over last night.

657
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:46,726
I should not be
starting anything new.

658
00:25:46,796 --> 00:25:48,929
Not now. Okay, here we go.

659
00:25:48,998 --> 00:25:50,330
No, I screw everything up.

660
00:25:50,399 --> 00:25:52,043
I don't want you to be
one of those things. I...

661
00:25:52,067 --> 00:25:53,867
Listen, what else
have you screwed up?

662
00:25:55,187 --> 00:25:56,264
Are you kidding me?

663
00:25:56,288 --> 00:25:58,408
I nuked my relationship
with Meredith.

664
00:25:58,474 --> 00:26:01,085
I got kicked out of
my place. I drank.

665
00:26:01,109 --> 00:26:02,709
Sixty days ago. And
you're doing great.

666
00:26:03,245 --> 00:26:04,912
Yeah.

667
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:09,199
I hit 60 days for the
fourth time in my life.

668
00:26:09,268 --> 00:26:11,346
Ever since, I have been
avoiding big cases like the plague.

669
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:13,610
I have just been
doing aneurysm repairs

670
00:26:13,756 --> 00:26:14,816
until I know I'm ready.

671
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,440
And then today,

672
00:26:16,508 --> 00:26:19,309
I get this woman with a
live grenade in her head

673
00:26:19,378 --> 00:26:21,289
who happens to be Derek and
Meredith's surgical love child,

674
00:26:21,313 --> 00:26:23,658
and I get to screw
this up now, too.

675
00:26:23,682 --> 00:26:24,748
I...

676
00:26:26,419 --> 00:26:27,729
I think I'm gonna
kill this girl.

677
00:26:27,753 --> 00:26:29,063
Okay, you want to
know what I think?

678
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:31,121
I think if there were any
other surgeon's name

679
00:26:31,173 --> 00:26:32,505
on this old chart,

680
00:26:32,574 --> 00:26:35,375
you wouldn't be
thinking twice about this.

681
00:26:35,443 --> 00:26:36,854
Meredith doesn't
think I can do it.

682
00:26:36,878 --> 00:26:38,529
Who cares what she thinks?

683
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:40,180
Meredith is not a neurosurgeon.

684
00:26:40,249 --> 00:26:42,166
And she certainly isn't you.

685
00:26:42,234 --> 00:26:44,518
Why are you giving a
second to what she thinks?

686
00:26:44,586 --> 00:26:47,003
You're the one who
has to do it, Amelia.

687
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:49,106
So just do it.

688
00:27:07,075 --> 00:27:08,408
Daphne, are you cold?

689
00:27:08,476 --> 00:27:09,526
I'm hot.

690
00:27:11,831 --> 00:27:12,979
Grey, we got to move now.

691
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:14,492
Okay. Let's get ready to move.

692
00:27:14,516 --> 00:27:17,935
I need some extra lap pads
and Surgicel right here by me.

693
00:27:18,003 --> 00:27:21,321
Daphne, I'm gonna check
and see how we're doing, okay?

694
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:22,489
No, wait.

695
00:27:23,658 --> 00:27:26,026
Daphne, call your son.

696
00:27:27,612 --> 00:27:29,279
Not like this.

697
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:34,551
It's been too long.
He'll never forgive me.

698
00:27:34,619 --> 00:27:36,531
Well, he might not, but
you deserve the chance.

699
00:27:36,555 --> 00:27:38,756
Okay, you made a bad
choice, but you turned it around.

700
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:40,424
You've atoned.

701
00:27:40,493 --> 00:27:41,803
All right, you've
tried, you know that,

702
00:27:41,827 --> 00:27:43,760
so you have to forgive yourself.

703
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:46,513
Now, you deserve a
chance to show him you tried.

704
00:27:48,984 --> 00:27:50,016
He's right.

705
00:27:50,785 --> 00:27:51,951
Let's call.

706
00:28:15,076 --> 00:28:16,343
David?

707
00:28:18,514 --> 00:28:19,763
It's Daph...

708
00:28:22,267 --> 00:28:23,466
It's Mom.

709
00:28:34,763 --> 00:28:37,197
Okay, Katie, it's time to go.

710
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:39,450
All right. Let's move.

711
00:28:40,035 --> 00:28:41,184
Wait.

712
00:28:42,604 --> 00:28:45,005
Just please don't kill me.

713
00:28:49,962 --> 00:28:51,194
Okay.

714
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:53,447
Okay.

715
00:28:54,199 --> 00:28:55,549
See you then.

716
00:28:56,885 --> 00:28:58,785
He said he's coming.

717
00:28:58,854 --> 00:29:00,094
He's coming to see me.

718
00:29:03,609 --> 00:29:05,475
He sounded so grown-up.

719
00:29:06,979 --> 00:29:09,612
Okay, let's hang some
blood and push pressors.

720
00:29:09,681 --> 00:29:11,826
Daphne, I have to check
now, okay? Don't. I'm scared.

721
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:13,266
Hey, Daphne. We're here, okay?

722
00:29:13,335 --> 00:29:15,251
Dr. Grey's here. She's
just gonna take a look.

723
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,419
Okay.

724
00:29:16,488 --> 00:29:18,488
Ready, one, two, three.

725
00:29:19,658 --> 00:29:21,352
Okay, okay. Okay, let's go.

726
00:29:21,376 --> 00:29:22,604
Blake, we need an Ambu bag.

727
00:29:22,628 --> 00:29:24,244
And let's keep the blood coming.

728
00:29:24,329 --> 00:29:26,063
We got to go. Let's
get her in there.

729
00:29:26,131 --> 00:29:27,431
Ready? Let's go.

730
00:30:34,783 --> 00:30:36,533
David said he was coming.

731
00:30:37,869 --> 00:30:39,102
Is he coming?

732
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:41,688
He's on his way. Stay with me.

733
00:31:05,413 --> 00:31:06,653
<i>All right, everybody.</i>

734
00:31:06,682 --> 00:31:09,082
<i>It's a beautiful
night to save lives.</i>

735
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:10,383
<i>Let's have some fun.</i>

736
00:32:02,821 --> 00:32:05,141
I told the morgue she's coming.

737
00:32:07,326 --> 00:32:09,326
Nurse's station.

738
00:32:12,797 --> 00:32:14,997
You called the
morgue "the plumber."

739
00:32:17,569 --> 00:32:18,802
It's habit.

740
00:32:19,855 --> 00:32:21,872
It's different over there.

741
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,573
You work on people who...

742
00:32:23,642 --> 00:32:26,676
It's part of their job
to get hurt and die.

743
00:32:26,745 --> 00:32:28,056
You never have
to call the families.

744
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,412
Someone else does that.

745
00:32:30,748 --> 00:32:32,315
It makes you...

746
00:32:33,685 --> 00:32:35,751
Yeah, I'm trying
to break that habit.

747
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:40,923
Why did you come here?

748
00:32:41,826 --> 00:32:43,904
What happened
with Owen's sister?

749
00:32:43,928 --> 00:32:46,029
You're a friend of Owen Hunt's.

750
00:32:47,099 --> 00:32:48,376
I figured he would
have told you.

751
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:51,840
He said you put her in a
helicopter, and it crashed.

752
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:00,950
All right, Meg and I were
working in a field unit.

753
00:33:01,012 --> 00:33:02,412
We needed to
transport a patient.

754
00:33:02,481 --> 00:33:04,814
There was only room on
the chopper for one of us.

755
00:33:04,883 --> 00:33:07,116
It was gonna be an ugly
ride, unprotected airspace.

756
00:33:07,186 --> 00:33:09,352
So I said I was gonna go.

757
00:33:09,421 --> 00:33:11,237
Meg said it was her patient.

758
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,590
I told her no.

759
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:18,161
And we fought, and finally...

760
00:33:22,634 --> 00:33:24,167
I mean, it was her patient.

761
00:33:26,672 --> 00:33:29,112
I would have done the
same thing if it was mine.

762
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:36,313
So I couldn't tell her no.

763
00:33:38,117 --> 00:33:39,399
And the helicopter...

764
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,719
Never got there.

765
00:33:45,657 --> 00:33:47,323
No one knows what happened.

766
00:33:48,293 --> 00:33:51,294
Just disappeared.

767
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:54,364
No trace.

768
00:33:58,003 --> 00:34:01,363
So he thinks you should
have been on that helicopter.

769
00:34:04,126 --> 00:34:06,759
I don't go asking about
your dead husband, do I?

770
00:34:17,856 --> 00:34:19,455
Oh! Well...

771
00:34:20,809 --> 00:34:22,649
Don't you look nice? Thank you.

772
00:34:22,711 --> 00:34:23,877
Hey.

773
00:34:23,946 --> 00:34:25,645
Are you... Are you
done for the night?

774
00:34:25,731 --> 00:34:27,425
Yeah, I am. You know, I just...

775
00:34:27,449 --> 00:34:28,882
Oh, good. Well, hey, have fun.

776
00:34:28,951 --> 00:34:30,671
Thank you. Have a good night.

777
00:34:33,471 --> 00:34:37,040
Yes, have fun with,
um, who is it again?

778
00:34:37,108 --> 00:34:38,508
Oh! Um... Artisanal soap.

779
00:34:38,977 --> 00:34:40,477
Um...

780
00:34:40,545 --> 00:34:43,480
Robbins, you're an
outstanding surgeon.

781
00:34:43,532 --> 00:34:45,665
Oh, thank you. And an
extraordinary woman.

782
00:34:45,734 --> 00:34:47,900
Oh, Richard. I'm super gay.

783
00:34:47,986 --> 00:34:50,436
Like, I'm the gayest
of gays. I'm lesbianic.

784
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:51,615
And you're a very handsome man.

785
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:52,879
That is very... Oh, cut it out.

786
00:34:54,142 --> 00:34:57,093
Someone like you deserves
someone very special...

787
00:34:57,162 --> 00:34:58,728
A quality person.

788
00:34:58,796 --> 00:35:03,917
And I worry that if you
squander your heart

789
00:35:03,985 --> 00:35:08,204
with all of these many,
many more frivolous...

790
00:35:08,256 --> 00:35:10,523
Whoa, whoa. The thing
about being my wingman is

791
00:35:10,592 --> 00:35:12,191
you can't also be my dad.

792
00:35:13,545 --> 00:35:16,462
Richard, I owe you.

793
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:20,534
I'm too young and too fun to
spend the rest of my life alone.

794
00:35:20,602 --> 00:35:22,969
And I was... I was
too scared to try,

795
00:35:23,038 --> 00:35:25,338
but you helped me
remember what it was like

796
00:35:25,407 --> 00:35:29,509
when I was open and confident
and fun and a little slutty.

797
00:35:29,578 --> 00:35:32,128
You helped me be slutty again.

798
00:35:32,197 --> 00:35:35,498
Well, I'm not sure
I'd phrase it like that.

799
00:35:35,551 --> 00:35:37,450
You helped me fly.

800
00:35:37,536 --> 00:35:39,452
So, good job.

801
00:35:40,255 --> 00:35:41,255
Thank you.

802
00:35:43,308 --> 00:35:44,808
I got to fly now.

803
00:35:52,167 --> 00:35:53,365
Keep it in the drawer.

804
00:35:53,434 --> 00:35:54,650
Huh?

805
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:58,521
I don't want it, but
I don't want it gone.

806
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:00,823
So the drawer is good.

807
00:36:00,892 --> 00:36:03,793
Just, um, keep it in the drawer.

808
00:36:05,797 --> 00:36:07,531
Here. My half of the phone bill.

809
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:08,898
Oh. No. I told you.

810
00:36:08,966 --> 00:36:10,300
And I appreciate that.

811
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:13,820
But I don't want to
leave anything undone.

812
00:36:14,923 --> 00:36:16,043
Okay?

813
00:36:18,209 --> 00:36:19,376
Okay.

814
00:36:30,289 --> 00:36:31,354
What?

815
00:36:33,842 --> 00:36:35,258
Uh, you need anything?

816
00:36:36,111 --> 00:36:38,278
What do you mean?

817
00:36:38,346 --> 00:36:39,957
It's just... I mean, if
you need anything,

818
00:36:39,981 --> 00:36:41,221
let me know, okay?

819
00:36:44,069 --> 00:36:45,069
Did, um...

820
00:36:45,987 --> 00:36:48,637
Did Arizona tell you...

821
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:50,868
I worked in peds.
I figured it out.

822
00:36:50,892 --> 00:36:52,069
You're, like, all
happy all the time,

823
00:36:52,093 --> 00:36:53,459
kind of sweaty.

824
00:36:53,528 --> 00:36:54,768
How far along are you?

825
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:56,379
Nine weeks.

826
00:36:57,432 --> 00:36:58,672
He doesn't know?

827
00:36:59,418 --> 00:37:01,651
Not yet.

828
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:04,840
Well, you should tell him
before he figures it out, too.

829
00:37:18,336 --> 00:37:19,969
DeLuca's working late.

830
00:37:20,805 --> 00:37:21,921
Um...

831
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:23,756
Well, I needed
some old case files

832
00:37:23,825 --> 00:37:25,524
uploaded into the
computer system.

833
00:37:25,593 --> 00:37:26,759
Ah.

834
00:37:26,828 --> 00:37:29,896
Well, that'll keep him
here until dawn, at least.

835
00:37:29,965 --> 00:37:31,364
DeLuca's a hard worker.

836
00:37:31,432 --> 00:37:32,749
Yeah, he is.

837
00:37:32,817 --> 00:37:34,217
He really cares.

838
00:37:36,488 --> 00:37:38,605
He's a good guy. Truly.

839
00:37:40,859 --> 00:37:41,979
I like him.

840
00:37:42,044 --> 00:37:45,812
Well, I suppose I could
cut him some slack.

841
00:37:46,982 --> 00:37:48,514
I appreciate it.

842
00:37:50,852 --> 00:37:53,292
I like that you were
looking out for me.

843
00:37:59,043 --> 00:38:00,683
What?

844
00:38:02,397 --> 00:38:05,047
It's just gonna be nice to
have all those charts uploaded.

845
00:38:11,006 --> 00:38:14,166
Want to go get some
dinner? I would love that.

846
00:38:20,949 --> 00:38:22,248
How is she?

847
00:38:22,316 --> 00:38:23,349
She's great.

848
00:38:23,418 --> 00:38:25,134
Am I missing my pageant?

849
00:38:25,987 --> 00:38:27,737
She have deficits?

850
00:38:27,806 --> 00:38:30,890
No. No. No deficits.
Neuro exam checks out.

851
00:38:30,958 --> 00:38:33,492
She's just a little
loopy from the meds.

852
00:38:33,562 --> 00:38:35,061
Okay. Good.

853
00:38:35,129 --> 00:38:36,463
Did you fix me?

854
00:38:36,531 --> 00:38:39,015
Dr. Shepherd and
Dr. Edwards did.

855
00:38:39,083 --> 00:38:40,416
I fixed you last time.

856
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:41,968
Right.

857
00:38:42,037 --> 00:38:43,819
I was such a bitch to you.

858
00:38:45,673 --> 00:38:47,440
That was a long time ago.

859
00:38:47,509 --> 00:38:49,075
You're all grown up now.

860
00:38:49,161 --> 00:38:52,178
Yeah. You are, too.

861
00:38:52,247 --> 00:38:54,567
I don't get lost
around here anymore.

862
00:38:56,117 --> 00:38:57,817
Dr. Shepherd fixed me?

863
00:38:58,420 --> 00:38:59,886
She did.

864
00:38:59,955 --> 00:39:01,195
She's very good.

865
00:39:02,991 --> 00:39:05,358
What happened to
guy Dr. Shepherd?

866
00:39:07,579 --> 00:39:09,279
That's a long story.

867
00:39:11,649 --> 00:39:13,516
You take care, okay?

868
00:39:13,584 --> 00:39:14,984
Take care of that brain.

869
00:39:52,307 --> 00:39:53,606
Congratulations.

870
00:40:00,414 --> 00:40:02,966
We're not starting something
new. I don't accept that.

871
00:40:05,353 --> 00:40:08,604
If it were new, I
wouldn't have your boot.

872
00:40:09,807 --> 00:40:12,892
Now, if you want to start over,

873
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,395
forget all that, start fresh,

874
00:40:15,463 --> 00:40:17,491
if that's easier for you,
then we can do that, too.

875
00:40:17,515 --> 00:40:19,148
However you want
to do it. But let's...

876
00:40:20,802 --> 00:40:22,167
Let's do it.

877
00:40:23,855 --> 00:40:25,404
Just like new?

878
00:40:26,541 --> 00:40:28,774
Yep. Square one.

879
00:40:54,001 --> 00:40:56,135
What are you doing?

880
00:40:56,204 --> 00:40:58,521
I barely know you. At least
ask me out on a date first.

881
00:41:02,794 --> 00:41:05,895
<i>We can start over. Every day.</i>

882
00:41:06,598 --> 00:41:08,163
<i>We get second chances...</i>

883
00:41:08,232 --> 00:41:10,933
Just be prepared.
She may look a little...

884
00:41:11,002 --> 00:41:12,134
I know.

885
00:41:12,203 --> 00:41:13,843
I mean, I haven't
seen her in six years.

886
00:41:13,872 --> 00:41:16,072
<i>To become who we
always wanted to be.</i>

887
00:41:17,158 --> 00:41:18,857
<i>We can leave our past behind.</i>

888
00:41:18,927 --> 00:41:21,305
You sure you're ready for this?

889
00:41:21,329 --> 00:41:22,995
<i>Or we can learn from it.</i>

890
00:41:25,317 --> 00:41:26,582
<i>And honor it.</i>

891
00:41:30,622 --> 00:41:31,804
Hi, David.

892
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:34,289
Hi.

893
00:42:00,401 --> 00:42:04,987
<i>We can decide it's
never too late to change.</i>

894
00:42:05,056 --> 00:42:07,523
These people don't
have that chance.

895
00:42:08,259 --> 00:42:10,259
They left it to you.

896
00:42:10,328 --> 00:42:12,445
They let you learn from them.

897
00:42:12,514 --> 00:42:14,063
So let's say thank you.

898
00:42:16,317 --> 00:42:17,450
And not screw it up.
