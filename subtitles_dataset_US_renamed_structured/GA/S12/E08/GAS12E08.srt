1
00:00:02,569 --> 00:00:04,649
<i>They say you
fight fire with fire.</i>

2
00:00:04,705 --> 00:00:06,350
<i>We do it in
medicine all the time.</i>

3
00:00:06,374 --> 00:00:08,374
Owen won't say what it's about,

4
00:00:08,442 --> 00:00:11,010
and nobody knows this
Riggs, except Kepner.

5
00:00:11,595 --> 00:00:13,111
Maybe Kepner knows.

6
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:15,097
<i>We cut you to
repair your injury.</i>

7
00:00:15,165 --> 00:00:16,181
Is that snow?

8
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:17,599
<i>We hurt you to heal you.</i>

9
00:00:18,285 --> 00:00:19,351
Are we still good?

10
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:21,180
Yeah, we're good, I told you.

11
00:00:21,204 --> 00:00:23,204
I'm just making
sure. We're good.

12
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:24,322
Good with what?

13
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:26,031
Nothing. Don't worry about it.

14
00:00:28,295 --> 00:00:31,363
Guys, it's like 60 degrees
out. That can't be snow.

15
00:00:31,432 --> 00:00:32,664
<i>We stoke the flames.</i>

16
00:00:32,733 --> 00:00:34,866
They just keep
circling each other.

17
00:00:34,935 --> 00:00:37,014
I keep thinking one of them's
gonna pull out a switchblade.

18
00:00:37,038 --> 00:00:38,637
Oh, it's about a chick.

19
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:41,222
When two guys hate each
other, it's usually about a chick.

20
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:42,568
Is that snow? Really?

21
00:00:42,592 --> 00:00:43,803
Where? Yeah, you're right.

22
00:00:43,827 --> 00:00:45,271
That looks like
snow out there. Huh.

23
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:48,463
<i>But playing with fire
is a dangerous game.</i>

24
00:00:48,532 --> 00:00:50,277
Well, you know they're
saying it's about you.

25
00:00:50,301 --> 00:00:51,366
What?

26
00:00:51,435 --> 00:00:54,203
You and Riggs. A
torrid affair in Jordan.

27
00:00:54,271 --> 00:00:57,272
That's... Oh, no!
That is not at...

28
00:00:57,341 --> 00:00:58,584
Don't worry, I shut that down.

29
00:00:58,608 --> 00:00:59,975
God! Thank you. Geez!

30
00:01:00,044 --> 00:01:01,387
No, I think it goes
back further than that,

31
00:01:01,411 --> 00:01:02,689
because I worked with Riggs,

32
00:01:02,713 --> 00:01:04,953
and he never even
mentioned knowing Hunt.

33
00:01:05,716 --> 00:01:08,076
Oh, my gosh. Hunt and Riggs!

34
00:01:08,118 --> 00:01:10,518
What if they had
the torrid affair?

35
00:01:10,554 --> 00:01:13,005
Come on. No.
Just think about it.

36
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:17,225
Wartime, no rules,
men in uniform... Kissing.

37
00:01:18,028 --> 00:01:19,060
Huh.

38
00:01:19,129 --> 00:01:20,928
Oh, no way. What?

39
00:01:20,997 --> 00:01:23,317
I didn't say it. Arizona did.

40
00:01:24,101 --> 00:01:27,102
I heard that Riggs lost
a patient on the table

41
00:01:27,171 --> 00:01:28,887
and tried to blame it on Hunt.

42
00:01:28,956 --> 00:01:31,033
Yeah, the gossip mill is getting a
little out of hand, don't you think?

43
00:01:31,057 --> 00:01:32,102
Oh, no, it's not gossip.

44
00:01:32,126 --> 00:01:33,369
It's, um...

45
00:01:33,393 --> 00:01:34,537
What do you call
it? Scuttlebutt.

46
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:36,194
No.

47
00:01:36,896 --> 00:01:38,413
Callie, um...

48
00:01:38,499 --> 00:01:40,933
You and Arizona,
before you guys split,

49
00:01:41,001 --> 00:01:44,085
you did the
counseling thing, right?

50
00:01:44,154 --> 00:01:47,122
Oh, God. Yeah. Yeah.

51
00:01:48,676 --> 00:01:51,460
I heard that you were
looking more for a lawyer.

52
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:54,429
You heard that, huh?

53
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:56,481
Scuttlebutt.

54
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,200
Sure.

55
00:02:04,274 --> 00:02:07,091
You're on my
service today. I am.

56
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,760
You're good with that, right?

57
00:02:08,829 --> 00:02:11,396
I mean, you and I...

58
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:14,032
You don't have any problem
working under me, right?

59
00:02:14,084 --> 00:02:15,717
Well, I think we've
established that.

60
00:02:17,921 --> 00:02:19,187
No, but see, this...

61
00:02:19,256 --> 00:02:21,067
This is exactly what
I'm talking about.

62
00:02:21,091 --> 00:02:23,157
Outside of that door,
we are professionals.

63
00:02:23,227 --> 00:02:24,593
There can be none of this.

64
00:02:24,661 --> 00:02:25,894
Yes, ma'am.

65
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:31,650
Hey.

66
00:02:37,641 --> 00:02:38,681
For the road.

67
00:02:49,403 --> 00:02:50,669
Is it snowing?

68
00:02:58,312 --> 00:02:59,552
Is it what I think it is?

69
00:02:59,612 --> 00:03:02,513
Uh-huh. Just got the
call. It's all coming here.

70
00:03:02,582 --> 00:03:04,149
Okay, how many we looking at?

71
00:03:04,218 --> 00:03:05,845
Over 40. Where's
the protocol for this?

72
00:03:05,869 --> 00:03:07,564
Bailey... Gotta be
some guidelines.

73
00:03:07,588 --> 00:03:09,971
Look, it's your first
crisis. You'll be fine.

74
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,784
I know! As soon
as I can find the...

75
00:03:11,808 --> 00:03:14,042
Bailey, there's nothing
you need in those binders.

76
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:16,244
Okay, you just have to
take things as they come.

77
00:03:16,313 --> 00:03:18,596
But you won't see them
until they're right here.

78
00:03:18,665 --> 00:03:22,767
You know what to do. If you're
in control, they're in control.

79
00:03:22,836 --> 00:03:25,503
Oh, and, uh, stand on the
stairs when you talk to them.

80
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:27,067
Makes them feel watched over.

81
00:03:27,091 --> 00:03:28,340
Is that why you do that?

82
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:37,382
Four crews of firefighters

83
00:03:37,451 --> 00:03:40,652
were trapped battling
wildfires east of town.

84
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:43,622
We have at least
40 injuries en route,

85
00:03:43,691 --> 00:03:45,635
I said we would
take all of them.

86
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:47,358
Forty? We're gonna
hit capacity and...

87
00:03:47,428 --> 00:03:49,288
We will take all of them.

88
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:52,714
We're looking at second,
third, and fourth-degree burns,

89
00:03:52,783 --> 00:03:55,116
smoke inhalation
and some traumas.

90
00:03:55,185 --> 00:03:59,103
All non-critical... Patients...

91
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:00,639
Um...

92
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:05,777
Are being transferred to
Seattle Pres and Tacoma.

93
00:04:07,514 --> 00:04:10,832
This entire hospital is now
a burn-treatment center.

94
00:04:10,901 --> 00:04:13,434
If you are a little rusty...

95
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:15,615
Did you stay here
again last night? Yeah.

96
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:17,021
You sleep at all?

97
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,591
I'm fine.

98
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,470
Plastics will be
available for consult,

99
00:04:21,494 --> 00:04:24,612
but they will be in high demand,
and cannot be everywhere.

100
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:26,081
If you need them...

101
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:28,261
It's definitely because
of a chick. Shush.

102
00:04:28,285 --> 00:04:31,369
Residents, stay with
your assigned attendings

103
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:34,856
unless needed in the
burn unit, or in the pit.

104
00:04:34,925 --> 00:04:37,626
Uh, everyone who is on
call has been called in.

105
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:39,460
This is an
all-hands-on-deck situation.

106
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:42,797
You with Grey again?
I'm always with Grey,

107
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:45,099
which is the problem for Callie,

108
00:04:45,168 --> 00:04:47,246
so I'm a nun, basically.

109
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:50,471
Worship at the altar of Our
Lady of General Surgery.

110
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:52,841
That's a good choice. Mmm.

111
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:55,176
You know, I tried
dating an attending.

112
00:04:55,245 --> 00:04:58,380
It just... It doesn't work.

113
00:04:58,448 --> 00:05:00,481
Prioritize according
to... Wilson does it.

114
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,830
Yeah, well, Wilson got lucky.

115
00:05:02,386 --> 00:05:04,218
Triage in the ER.

116
00:05:04,287 --> 00:05:08,039
Send the critical patients
to the burn unit or the OR.

117
00:05:08,108 --> 00:05:11,526
Dr. Avery is your point
person on this, okay?

118
00:05:12,329 --> 00:05:13,361
Uh...

119
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:16,715
Let's see, then that's...

120
00:05:19,018 --> 00:05:23,655
That's it, people.
Okay, get to work.

121
00:05:27,394 --> 00:05:29,411
I'll jump on triage and
the most acute injuries.

122
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,191
April. You take any
compromised airways.

123
00:05:31,215 --> 00:05:32,514
Stop running away from me,

124
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:34,494
eventually we have to
find time and talk about this.

125
00:05:34,518 --> 00:05:36,229
It's been three days
already. Now is not that time.

126
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:37,702
We have time,
before it gets crazy.

127
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:39,899
It's already crazy. My ER's
about to be jam-packed.

128
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:42,102
I don't have time,
neither do you.

129
00:05:42,126 --> 00:05:44,887
We would if you'd stop talking about
how much damn time we don't have.

130
00:05:45,729 --> 00:05:46,906
Let's get 'em loaded.

131
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:49,614
Okay, got it. Status?

132
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:51,442
Choppers are
stacking up, let's move!

133
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,420
Come on, let's go! Move!

134
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:01,360
No, no, no! That's
gotta go over there.

135
00:06:01,428 --> 00:06:04,679
People, if you are not on
your specialty, you are on burn.

136
00:06:04,748 --> 00:06:05,864
Consider yourselves

137
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:07,610
burns and plastics
specialists for the day.

138
00:06:07,634 --> 00:06:09,517
We treat, debride, admit,

139
00:06:09,586 --> 00:06:12,026
if you have any questions
at all, you come find me.

140
00:06:13,423 --> 00:06:16,541
Take him to trauma
two. This way, over there.

141
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:18,142
Patient has partial
thickness burns

142
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:20,679
on his chest and abdomen,
and severe smoke inhalation.

143
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:22,908
Let's get to the part with
the metal in his chest.

144
00:06:22,932 --> 00:06:25,584
He lost his footing in the
smoke, he fell into the ravine,

145
00:06:25,652 --> 00:06:27,285
and a steel spike
broke his fall.

146
00:06:27,353 --> 00:06:29,615
We need a heart ultrasound.
Let's page cardio, get Pierce.

147
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:30,767
Okay. No problem. I'm here.

148
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:31,791
I can wait for Pierce.

149
00:06:31,841 --> 00:06:33,058
I said I got it.

150
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:36,989
Okay. He has blood
in the pericardium,

151
00:06:37,013 --> 00:06:38,724
but I can't tell if it's
penetrated the ventricle.

152
00:06:38,748 --> 00:06:40,159
Blake, get Pierce. Okay.

153
00:06:40,183 --> 00:06:41,861
Most likely the only
reason he isn't bleeding out

154
00:06:41,885 --> 00:06:43,346
is because the metal
is blocking the hole.

155
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:45,070
That's an interesting theory.

156
00:06:45,139 --> 00:06:46,800
Only one way to find out.
Blake, let's pull out the spike.

157
00:06:46,824 --> 00:06:48,117
Oh, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

158
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:49,040
We're gonna take
it out in the OR,

159
00:06:49,109 --> 00:06:50,336
where we can
control the bleeding.

160
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,838
There might not be any bleeding,

161
00:06:51,862 --> 00:06:53,706
so let's don't fill up an OR
until we know that we have to.

162
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:56,648
And risk him bleeding out
before we ever get up there? No.

163
00:06:56,717 --> 00:06:58,834
No one is touching this
thing until we get Pierce.

164
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,331
There. Now she
can get a proper look.

165
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:04,901
Who the hell do you think
you are? If I say wait, we wait.

166
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:07,508
You are out of control!
And I will not stand for it.

167
00:07:07,577 --> 00:07:09,277
Hey, Kepner, how are we?

168
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:13,215
Stretched. I need somebody to
take a look at the guy in bed four!

169
00:07:13,283 --> 00:07:16,885
Um, I will do it. I
will see bed four.

170
00:07:18,588 --> 00:07:21,156
<i>They're coming in! I need
more morphine over here.</i>

171
00:07:21,225 --> 00:07:22,540
Tyler, how's Tyler?

172
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:24,726
His hand's pretty bad. He
might lose some fingers.

173
00:07:24,794 --> 00:07:26,594
You tell him he'll live.

174
00:07:28,215 --> 00:07:30,276
I'm Dr. Bailey.
How we doing here?

175
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,011
I'm fine, I've been
burned so many times,

176
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:34,702
my wife says I smell like bacon.

177
00:07:34,771 --> 00:07:36,315
You need to put
that mask back on.

178
00:07:36,339 --> 00:07:38,306
You need to check
on these other guys.

179
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:39,952
They're in worse shape than me.

180
00:07:39,976 --> 00:07:42,561
We will take care
of all of you, okay?

181
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:45,909
So just let me have a look.

182
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,132
Mmm-hmm.

183
00:07:57,694 --> 00:07:58,894
Okay.

184
00:08:03,367 --> 00:08:04,999
How bad is it?

185
00:08:26,373 --> 00:08:28,484
He's bleeding right
there. In the pericardium.

186
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:31,026
It's not much. It'll
likely resolve on its own.

187
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:33,478
Or it won't and
it'll be too late.

188
00:08:33,547 --> 00:08:35,446
Admit him, monitor him closely,

189
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,209
and tell me if his
pressure drops.

190
00:08:37,233 --> 00:08:39,751
Book an OR. Absolutely.
I'll book an OR.

191
00:08:43,607 --> 00:08:44,607
She's my God.

192
00:08:51,581 --> 00:08:53,259
Hey! Hold on. Do
you have time now?

193
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:55,528
Not really, I'm on my way
to surgery with a maniac.

194
00:08:55,552 --> 00:08:57,563
Yeah, so let's do it now
before we both get too busy.

195
00:08:57,587 --> 00:08:59,048
All right, well, let's
make it quick, because...

196
00:08:59,072 --> 00:09:00,900
Alex, could you...
Wilson, go away!

197
00:09:00,924 --> 00:09:03,374
Just give us a minute,
okay? We're busy.

198
00:09:05,478 --> 00:09:07,011
Thanks a lot.

199
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,980
She'll be fine.

200
00:09:09,032 --> 00:09:13,401
We were taking a break
at base camp, and...

201
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:17,021
Casey, I'm gonna need
you to stop talking, okay?

202
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:19,474
There's severe lung damage here.

203
00:09:19,543 --> 00:09:20,926
Book an OR. Yeah.

204
00:09:20,994 --> 00:09:23,895
Casey, we're gonna take
you into surgery right away.

205
00:09:23,964 --> 00:09:25,924
OR's backed up.
They're saying it's an hour.

206
00:09:25,966 --> 00:09:27,043
Tell them that's
not good enough.

207
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:29,400
No. Take these other guys first.

208
00:09:29,469 --> 00:09:32,036
I'll decide who goes
where, all right?

209
00:09:32,105 --> 00:09:35,440
Hey, I did my best
to get those guys out.

210
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:37,508
You got to make
sure they're okay.

211
00:09:37,578 --> 00:09:38,843
Can you do that?

212
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:41,086
Yeah.

213
00:09:42,732 --> 00:09:45,533
Let's get him to the burn
unit while we wait for the OR.

214
00:09:46,536 --> 00:09:50,571
Excuse me. Coming through.

215
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,374
Chief, the burn unit is full
and I need beds down here.

216
00:09:53,442 --> 00:09:55,237
We can't take any more,
we're already at capacity.

217
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:57,890
I have patients with extensive burns
that are on gurneys in the hallway.

218
00:09:57,914 --> 00:09:59,325
Well, we need to start
diverting to other hospitals.

219
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:00,576
No, no. We're not doing that.

220
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,794
Well, I need to know
what we are doing, please.

221
00:10:01,818 --> 00:10:03,258
Do I need to
notify Seattle Pres?

222
00:10:04,921 --> 00:10:06,287
Chief!

223
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:09,224
I said we're not turning
firefighters away.

224
00:10:09,292 --> 00:10:10,392
Come with me.

225
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:14,245
Okay!

226
00:10:14,314 --> 00:10:16,280
You folks, take your food to go.

227
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:19,484
All of these tables
go. Put away this food.

228
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:21,152
We triage here.

229
00:10:21,221 --> 00:10:23,633
I need gurneys, in lines
of three, all the way back.

230
00:10:23,657 --> 00:10:26,190
Minor and first-degree burns
are going to the pit, guys.

231
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:28,426
Criticals can go to
any available ICU bed.

232
00:10:28,494 --> 00:10:32,263
We need burn supplies, surgical
trays, gowns, gloves at every station.

233
00:10:32,332 --> 00:10:33,542
This enough room?

234
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:34,598
This will work.

235
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,551
I know you have to
do your doctor thing,

236
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:45,393
but maybe you can keep
the full moon under wraps.

237
00:10:46,629 --> 00:10:48,190
That's the part that I
kind of need to see.

238
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:50,798
Oh, you can see
whatever you want.

239
00:10:50,867 --> 00:10:54,385
It's the guys in my squad.
I'll never hear the end of it.

240
00:10:54,453 --> 00:10:56,165
I'll be discreet. No free shows.

241
00:10:56,189 --> 00:10:57,572
No guy has seen that

242
00:10:57,641 --> 00:11:00,074
since a middle school
wardrobe malfunction.

243
00:11:00,143 --> 00:11:01,709
Hopefully you're an expert, a...

244
00:11:01,778 --> 00:11:03,578
What, a butt doctor?

245
00:11:03,646 --> 00:11:05,846
That can't be right. You
can fix my butt, right?

246
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:09,317
Yes. The burn is
confined to one cheek,

247
00:11:09,386 --> 00:11:12,831
and luckily, I have a
good one to compare it to.

248
00:11:12,855 --> 00:11:16,724
Wow. Thank you very much.

249
00:11:16,793 --> 00:11:19,210
No. No, no, no. I didn't mean...

250
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:20,845
No. I'll take it.

251
00:11:20,913 --> 00:11:24,599
Yeah, it's... It'll do the job.

252
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:29,037
Hang in there, Turner.

253
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:30,288
God.

254
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:32,390
Here I am, complaining
about my butt burn.

255
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:35,371
Don't do that. Don't feel
guilty for not getting hurt.

256
00:11:35,395 --> 00:11:37,027
I mean, I work a
job where in order to

257
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:38,262
make a house payment,

258
00:11:38,331 --> 00:11:40,765
put food on the table,
there have to be fires.

259
00:11:40,834 --> 00:11:44,035
And big fires mean
overtime, hazard pay.

260
00:11:44,104 --> 00:11:47,021
You work like hell
to put them out, but...

261
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:52,110
A dirty, little part of you is
thinking, "Burn, baby, burn."

262
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:56,480
And you hate yourself. It sucks.

263
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:58,883
I make my living
off of sick babies.

264
00:12:00,921 --> 00:12:01,953
You get it.

265
00:12:04,157 --> 00:12:05,467
All right, you feel that?

266
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:06,635
Comin' through. Dr. Hunt?

267
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:07,737
Give him morphine. Owen?

268
00:12:07,761 --> 00:12:08,826
Mmm-hmm.

269
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:10,456
Your mom's boyfriend,
he's a firefighter, right?

270
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,596
Yeah. Why?

271
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:13,376
Because she's here, your mom.

272
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,577
Nurse's station.
How can I help you?

273
00:12:15,601 --> 00:12:16,934
Cross, take over.

274
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:20,304
Mom? Owen!

275
00:12:20,373 --> 00:12:22,974
John was working the fire.
They said they brought him here.

276
00:12:23,043 --> 00:12:24,553
Have you seen him? Uh...

277
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,510
Hang on, hang on.

278
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:27,595
He is in surgery.

279
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:29,614
Oh, dear God. Dr. Grey and...

280
00:12:32,052 --> 00:12:34,030
Kepner, page Pierce
to OR three. Okay.

281
00:12:34,054 --> 00:12:35,853
Mom, stay right here, okay?

282
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:40,725
There, I was right, there's
blood in the pericardium.

283
00:12:40,794 --> 00:12:42,838
I could've relieved it
with a needle downstairs.

284
00:12:42,862 --> 00:12:44,323
You did not need to open him up.

285
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:46,576
Well I did, because we're
not in a tent in a war zone.

286
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,840
Meredith...

287
00:12:48,468 --> 00:12:50,334
Hunt, is there a problem?

288
00:12:50,403 --> 00:12:51,681
Grey, the patient on your
table is my mother's boyfriend.

289
00:12:51,705 --> 00:12:52,785
How's it look?

290
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,490
It's not good. I didn't ask you!

291
00:12:56,559 --> 00:13:00,061
Dr. Grey cracked his chest
when she shouldn't have...

292
00:13:00,129 --> 00:13:02,858
Shut your mouth, step away
from the table, and scrub out.

293
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:05,261
Hey, what's going on here? I
need you to scrub in for Riggs.

294
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:07,301
What? Why?

295
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:09,348
Hunt, I got a guy in the burn
unit missing part of his chest wall,

296
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:10,416
I don't have time...

297
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,572
Owen, I have this.

298
00:13:11,641 --> 00:13:12,668
Dr. Pierce, we're fine here.

299
00:13:12,692 --> 00:13:14,392
Riggs, step back.

300
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,355
Okay, Hunt, I don't
work for you, okay?

301
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:19,246
I work for Pierce. If she
says leave, then I'll leave.

302
00:13:19,315 --> 00:13:20,682
Hunt, is there a reason

303
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:23,190
that I should be removing
Riggs from this surgery?

304
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:41,585
Are you okay?

305
00:13:41,655 --> 00:13:43,487
Yeah, no, my mom's boyfriend.

306
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:44,667
The firefighter. Yeah.

307
00:13:44,691 --> 00:13:45,935
He's here. Yeah,

308
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:48,026
Meredith is working on
him right now with Riggs.

309
00:13:48,094 --> 00:13:49,360
And that's a problem.

310
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:51,395
Owen, talk to me.
Why is this guy...

311
00:13:51,464 --> 00:13:52,992
I just don't want
him near my family.

312
00:13:59,021 --> 00:14:00,688
Proximal humerus fracture.

313
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:02,535
All he needs is a
sling for a few weeks.

314
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:06,377
Yeah, but I've got a full thickness
burn on his hand and forearm.

315
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:08,579
Will a graft even take?
You've got bone exposure.

316
00:14:08,647 --> 00:14:10,159
Give me a minute
to think about it.

317
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:11,482
I'd recommend it.

318
00:14:11,551 --> 00:14:13,601
Yeah, the graft? Counseling.

319
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:16,554
It gave us a sense of where
we were, which was nowhere.

320
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:18,056
But still...

321
00:14:18,124 --> 00:14:19,484
Second-degree
burns on the chest.

322
00:14:19,509 --> 00:14:21,036
Do you even want to
work it out with Kepner?

323
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,189
Can we not do this
right now? Sure.

324
00:14:23,213 --> 00:14:24,912
Okay.

325
00:14:24,981 --> 00:14:27,642
But one thing our therapist
said, that turned out to be true,

326
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:29,245
do not have sex while
you're sorting things out,

327
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:31,586
it's messy, it's
confusing. No sex.

328
00:14:34,474 --> 00:14:37,441
You guys had sex. Yeah.

329
00:14:38,895 --> 00:14:41,228
We did, too. It's messy.

330
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:42,346
It's really messy.

331
00:14:42,415 --> 00:14:44,198
I think you can both
get what you need.

332
00:14:44,266 --> 00:14:45,811
Yeah, I don't know. I mean,
I feel like it's so complicated.

333
00:14:45,835 --> 00:14:48,169
No, no, no, no, no. I'm
talking about his hand.

334
00:14:48,238 --> 00:14:49,504
Right.

335
00:14:49,572 --> 00:14:52,173
We do a living graft with
an abdominal pedicle flap.

336
00:14:52,259 --> 00:14:54,074
We literally sew his
hand into his abdomen.

337
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:56,894
He'll have a graft and a sling.

338
00:14:58,064 --> 00:15:00,648
That's good. Yeah.

339
00:15:00,717 --> 00:15:03,150
I found the one! Oh, good.

340
00:15:03,219 --> 00:15:05,430
Now you can help me
find an arterial line kit.

341
00:15:05,454 --> 00:15:09,073
Not "the" one, a one,
maybe, but at least an option.

342
00:15:09,142 --> 00:15:10,575
I found an option!

343
00:15:10,644 --> 00:15:11,942
She's funny and cute,

344
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:14,528
and she actively
contributes to public safety.

345
00:15:14,597 --> 00:15:15,991
She's one of the firefighters?

346
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:17,931
Yes. And she's great.

347
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,234
And I think that
she thinks I'm great,

348
00:15:20,303 --> 00:15:22,970
but I need you to find out.

349
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:25,739
Sure, why don't you
write her a little note,

350
00:15:25,808 --> 00:15:28,192
you know, the ones with
the boxes that you can check,

351
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:29,626
and I'll pass it along.

352
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:31,028
Mmm.

353
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:33,514
Mmm. Don't you think
that sounds a little childish?

354
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:34,849
Yes, it does!

355
00:15:34,918 --> 00:15:36,984
I'm not gonna wingman
a patient for you!

356
00:15:42,325 --> 00:15:44,091
I set the Mayfield,

357
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,280
let's just drain the clot and
bring him back to the burn unit.

358
00:15:48,297 --> 00:15:51,298
Maybe it was, like, a
classified mission gone bad.

359
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:52,966
What?

360
00:15:53,036 --> 00:15:54,668
Hunt and Riggs.

361
00:15:54,737 --> 00:15:56,131
Maybe that's why
he won't talk about it,

362
00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:57,622
maybe it was like
a secret mission,

363
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:59,370
and one of them
double-crossed the other.

364
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:00,602
I don't want to talk about it.

365
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:02,188
Well, everyone
is talking about it.

366
00:16:02,212 --> 00:16:04,652
I don't want to gossip about it.

367
00:16:05,098 --> 00:16:08,266
Dr. Hunt's a sleepwalker
and a sleeptalker, actually.

368
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:09,367
Enough!

369
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:11,219
It's not gossip. It happened.

370
00:16:11,287 --> 00:16:12,687
I found him in an on-call room

371
00:16:12,755 --> 00:16:14,154
totally asleep, standing there.

372
00:16:14,224 --> 00:16:16,307
He was all, "Help,
help!" It was freaky!

373
00:16:16,376 --> 00:16:17,959
What did he say, exactly?

374
00:16:18,044 --> 00:16:19,543
"Do something," I think he said?

375
00:16:19,612 --> 00:16:21,212
I don't know. I was a little...

376
00:16:21,614 --> 00:16:23,014
I was scared.

377
00:16:23,082 --> 00:16:24,482
Wait. Cross...

378
00:16:27,186 --> 00:16:29,431
They'll probably take a big
piece of skin from your back

379
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:30,822
called a latissimus flap.

380
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:32,935
Now, it's gonna
leave a pretty big scar.

381
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:34,859
Scars are okay.

382
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:37,344
They show where you've been.

383
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:43,317
My leg is the Kelso fire of '08,

384
00:16:43,386 --> 00:16:47,938
and my shoulder's the
Yakima Valley of '13.

385
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:51,942
And... Oh... That...

386
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:56,180
That's, uh, my oven.

387
00:16:56,249 --> 00:17:01,435
Birthday cake for
my wife, Ruth's, 50th.

388
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:06,424
Casey, Casey, we
have to intubate you now.

389
00:17:06,492 --> 00:17:08,426
No. I can breathe.

390
00:17:09,262 --> 00:17:10,728
Ruth's on her way.

391
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:14,231
I... I want to
talk to her first.

392
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,311
Sir, we really need to give
your lungs a rest, okay?

393
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:18,085
No. I don't need it.

394
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:25,109
Hey... I don't want it.

395
00:17:29,064 --> 00:17:31,666
I think we can give
Casey a few more minutes

396
00:17:31,734 --> 00:17:33,835
till his wife gets here.

397
00:17:33,903 --> 00:17:36,537
But you put that mask on. Deal.

398
00:17:41,127 --> 00:17:43,177
He's being ridiculous.
We have to tube him, right?

399
00:17:43,245 --> 00:17:45,179
His left lung is
partially collapsed,

400
00:17:45,247 --> 00:17:47,315
the other one is damaged
from smoke inhalation.

401
00:17:47,383 --> 00:17:48,694
It's causing his heart to fail.

402
00:17:48,718 --> 00:17:50,663
Yeah, and he's starting to
have arrhythmias from rhabdo.

403
00:17:50,687 --> 00:17:52,531
Oh. I gotta go. Yeah, go.

404
00:17:52,555 --> 00:17:53,632
We need to clear an OR.

405
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:55,189
Uh, no, Casey's right,

406
00:17:55,257 --> 00:17:57,369
we need to be treating
the more urgent cases first.

407
00:17:57,393 --> 00:17:58,793
I'm sorry, but
what's more urgent

408
00:17:58,861 --> 00:18:00,945
than a guy with a
hole burned in his side?

409
00:18:01,013 --> 00:18:03,225
A case that will
survive surgery.

410
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:04,860
So what? We're just supposed
to tell him he's gonna die?

411
00:18:04,884 --> 00:18:07,434
We don't have to
tell him. He knows.

412
00:18:09,672 --> 00:18:13,312
Make him as comfortable as you
can, and tell me when his wife gets here.

413
00:18:21,817 --> 00:18:24,029
We are never eating
in that cafeteria again.

414
00:18:24,053 --> 00:18:27,054
I'm a little busy right now.
Do you need something?

415
00:18:27,123 --> 00:18:28,667
I needed a break. I
thought I'd take a minute.

416
00:18:28,691 --> 00:18:30,369
You know when I had a minute?

417
00:18:30,393 --> 00:18:33,104
This morning, when you and
Meredith were whispering in the hallway.

418
00:18:33,128 --> 00:18:34,189
I'm sorry about that.

419
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:35,607
And she yelled "Get
away" in my face

420
00:18:35,631 --> 00:18:36,931
like I was a stray dog.

421
00:18:36,999 --> 00:18:38,682
Come on.

422
00:18:38,751 --> 00:18:40,395
It's not funny. That's
not what she meant.

423
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:43,087
God, you always defend her,

424
00:18:43,156 --> 00:18:45,339
even when she's being
a complete bitch to me.

425
00:18:45,407 --> 00:18:47,736
Look, don't do that. Don't call
her that. And why wouldn't you?

426
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,593
Everyone here
just follows her lead.

427
00:18:49,662 --> 00:18:52,279
If you're out with Grey,
you're out, and I'm out.

428
00:18:52,347 --> 00:18:53,909
You're not out. You're fine.

429
00:18:53,933 --> 00:18:56,061
She spent a year acting
like I didn't even exist.

430
00:18:56,085 --> 00:18:58,564
So what is it? What? You think
she just sees you as my girlfriend?

431
00:18:58,588 --> 00:19:00,366
She doesn't even see me as that.

432
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:02,618
She would show up in our bedroom
and kick me out whenever she wanted to.

433
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:03,902
That hasn't happened
in a long time.

434
00:19:03,926 --> 00:19:06,160
Yeah, because I hauled
you out of that house.

435
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:08,495
Oh, I'm...

436
00:19:08,565 --> 00:19:10,715
I'm sorry, you "hauled"
me out of there?

437
00:19:10,783 --> 00:19:13,150
I had to, she had an
all-access pass to you.

438
00:19:13,219 --> 00:19:15,664
And you know what the
worst part is? Is that you let her.

439
00:19:15,688 --> 00:19:17,583
Here I thought we decided
to move in there together.

440
00:19:17,607 --> 00:19:19,451
Because she's always
your priority! That is not true!

441
00:19:19,475 --> 00:19:21,859
She has been through
a lot! Her husband died!

442
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:24,306
So what, that gives her a
license to treat me like crap?

443
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:25,646
No! No!

444
00:19:25,714 --> 00:19:27,759
It means she has the license
to take her crap out on me!

445
00:19:27,783 --> 00:19:29,828
It means I'm gonna be there
for her when she needs me,

446
00:19:29,852 --> 00:19:31,936
'cause she's the only
one I can count on!

447
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:34,939
She's the only
one? Just, I meant...

448
00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:40,677
Look, she stood by me for years
when everybody else left, no matter what.

449
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:42,274
I didn't mean... No, I get it.

450
00:19:42,298 --> 00:19:44,209
You're taking her side again,
'cause she is your priority.

451
00:19:44,233 --> 00:19:46,283
You don't get to tell me
what my priorities are!

452
00:19:47,736 --> 00:19:50,017
I have to focus on my patient.

453
00:19:51,174 --> 00:19:53,455
Look, Jo... Just go.

454
00:20:04,837 --> 00:20:08,672
Last stitch repairs the
rupture in the heart wall.

455
00:20:08,741 --> 00:20:10,658
3-0 prolene and pledget hold.

456
00:20:10,727 --> 00:20:11,887
Blake, can you snip, please?

457
00:20:15,264 --> 00:20:17,814
And Hunt said this guy
was dating his mom?

458
00:20:18,401 --> 00:20:19,561
Hmm? Suction.

459
00:20:20,686 --> 00:20:22,152
Blake, you heard that, right?

460
00:20:23,122 --> 00:20:24,638
Suction here.

461
00:20:24,707 --> 00:20:26,123
Hmm?

462
00:20:26,175 --> 00:20:27,541
He's fibrillating. Paddles.

463
00:20:27,609 --> 00:20:28,609
Got it.

464
00:20:31,914 --> 00:20:33,154
Charge to 10.

465
00:20:34,667 --> 00:20:36,347
Clear.

466
00:20:38,304 --> 00:20:39,687
Charge to 10 again.

467
00:20:39,756 --> 00:20:41,617
No, 25, okay? Let's don't
screw around. Twenty-five.

468
00:20:41,641 --> 00:20:43,090
25. Clear.

469
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:44,486
This never would've
happened if you hadn't...

470
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:45,587
It absolutely would have,

471
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:47,651
we just wouldn't be
here to catch it. Clear!

472
00:20:49,382 --> 00:20:51,615
All right, give me one
milligram of adrenaline.

473
00:20:51,684 --> 00:20:53,800
Okay, come on, come on. Damn it!

474
00:20:53,869 --> 00:20:55,202
Okay, where's the adrenaline?

475
00:21:04,497 --> 00:21:05,680
Oh!

476
00:21:05,748 --> 00:21:07,198
All right.

477
00:21:09,585 --> 00:21:13,104
Well, the fire is 80% contained.

478
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:16,724
Okay.

479
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:22,546
My crew. No losses today, Casey.

480
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:25,182
No. Many injuries,
but no losses.

481
00:21:26,719 --> 00:21:28,218
You prepare...

482
00:21:29,155 --> 00:21:31,022
The best you can.

483
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:33,390
You can't control everything.

484
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:36,610
You can't control
the wind, you know?

485
00:21:36,679 --> 00:21:38,879
You did everything you could.

486
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:40,948
Now.

487
00:21:41,884 --> 00:21:43,828
What can I do for you?

488
00:21:43,852 --> 00:21:47,104
Uh, just waiting for Ruth.

489
00:21:48,874 --> 00:21:49,874
Okay.

490
00:22:00,553 --> 00:22:04,054
This will heal nicely,
probably in about six weeks.

491
00:22:05,224 --> 00:22:06,640
So, um...

492
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:08,275
Maybe we could
see each other again?

493
00:22:08,344 --> 00:22:09,604
Like a follow-up appointment?

494
00:22:09,628 --> 00:22:10,677
Oh, um...

495
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:12,546
No, I don't mean... I mean yes,

496
00:22:12,615 --> 00:22:15,399
you can always make an
appointment with the admissions nurse.

497
00:22:15,468 --> 00:22:19,803
But I did... Okay.
Can you just sit tight?

498
00:22:19,872 --> 00:22:23,674
Well don't sit tight,
just... Be. Just be.

499
00:22:25,627 --> 00:22:26,660
Heh!

500
00:22:26,728 --> 00:22:27,861
I just tried to segue

501
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:30,180
from a wound closure
to a first date invite.

502
00:22:30,249 --> 00:22:31,443
Now that's just clumsy.

503
00:22:31,467 --> 00:22:33,362
Over her exposed
butt. And that's creepy.

504
00:22:33,386 --> 00:22:34,418
I need your help.

505
00:22:34,486 --> 00:22:36,569
Can you just go put
the good word in?

506
00:22:36,638 --> 00:22:40,707
You don't need me. You're
a smart, confident woman.

507
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:44,711
Stretch your wings, Robbins.
Stretch them out. Feel the air.

508
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:48,082
Stretch them out. Feel
the air. Feel the air.

509
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:52,586
My wife needs to come home.

510
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:56,674
I mean, I knew it
was a good idea,

511
00:22:56,743 --> 00:22:58,442
but looking at it up close,

512
00:22:58,510 --> 00:22:59,950
it's pretty spectacular.

513
00:22:59,995 --> 00:23:01,706
Yeah, yeah. It's a
miracle of the modern age.

514
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:04,548
So, what kind of sex was it?
Make-up sex or break-up sex?

515
00:23:04,617 --> 00:23:08,818
It was, you know, I
have no idea, actually.

516
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:10,782
Bovie? Well, what did April say?

517
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:12,501
Nothing. She didn't say
anything, she's not talking to me.

518
00:23:12,525 --> 00:23:14,019
She spent the last few
months hunting me down,

519
00:23:14,043 --> 00:23:15,503
and now she just
keeps walking away.

520
00:23:15,527 --> 00:23:16,622
Let's be done
talking about this now.

521
00:23:16,646 --> 00:23:18,090
Agreed. Well, okay,
'cause, you know,

522
00:23:18,114 --> 00:23:19,947
break-up sex is, um...

523
00:23:20,016 --> 00:23:22,360
Well, it feels sad-happy.
It's an emotional potpourri.

524
00:23:22,384 --> 00:23:24,935
All the feelings,
all the history,

525
00:23:25,004 --> 00:23:26,831
all of it, it's all
just right there,

526
00:23:26,855 --> 00:23:30,290
'cause it's... You know, you just know,
you just know that it's the last time,

527
00:23:30,359 --> 00:23:32,243
and it's like taking
in all the air you can

528
00:23:32,311 --> 00:23:33,577
before you go underwater.

529
00:23:33,646 --> 00:23:35,846
It's like, "Do me or die."
Break-up sex is the best.

530
00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:37,848
Yeah, but then you're broken up.

531
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:40,157
Huh. You know
what? You're right.

532
00:23:40,218 --> 00:23:41,501
Make-up sex is better,

533
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:43,820
because make-up sex
is like coming up for air

534
00:23:43,889 --> 00:23:45,917
when you thought there
wouldn't be any more air.

535
00:23:45,941 --> 00:23:47,240
So it's like all is forgiven,

536
00:23:47,309 --> 00:23:49,927
and you can throw off your
troubles and your clothes,

537
00:23:49,996 --> 00:23:52,812
and you're like out of the dark
and into the light, full speed ahead.

538
00:23:52,881 --> 00:23:54,548
Oh, God, it's the best.

539
00:23:55,584 --> 00:23:57,584
So which was it?

540
00:23:57,670 --> 00:23:58,813
I'm not answering that.

541
00:23:58,837 --> 00:24:00,805
Jackson. I don't
know, all right?

542
00:24:00,873 --> 00:24:02,851
Because maybe I thought it was one
thing and she thought it was the other.

543
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:04,591
What? Ooh. See? Messy.

544
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:06,960
But you know what's
not messy? This.

545
00:24:07,029 --> 00:24:10,413
I mean, this... This is elegant
genius. Mmm. Mmm-hmm.

546
00:24:10,483 --> 00:24:12,199
I'll tell you one thing.

547
00:24:12,268 --> 00:24:15,468
He is gonna be pretty
surprised when he wakes up.

548
00:24:22,628 --> 00:24:25,079
I was just looking
for extra Betadine.

549
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:30,134
Which is right there.

550
00:24:30,203 --> 00:24:32,786
So, obviously,
lamest excuse ever.

551
00:24:35,825 --> 00:24:38,092
You can't just
ignore me forever.

552
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:42,012
You don't have to like me, or be
my friend, or even be polite to me,

553
00:24:42,064 --> 00:24:44,748
but at least
acknowledge that I exist.

554
00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:48,519
Acknowledge that I'm a person
standing in front of you, saying words.

555
00:24:50,188 --> 00:24:51,488
Forget it.

556
00:25:03,068 --> 00:25:04,729
You got lucky. It wasn't luck.

557
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:06,653
He would have died
if I hadn't taken him in.

558
00:25:06,721 --> 00:25:09,867
John's surgery went well, his
doctors expect a full recovery.

559
00:25:09,891 --> 00:25:12,011
He's not awake yet,
but you can see him.

560
00:25:18,901 --> 00:25:20,167
Nathan?

561
00:25:54,569 --> 00:25:57,470
We don't think Riggs
and Owen's mom...

562
00:25:57,539 --> 00:26:00,441
You don't think
that's the thing? No.

563
00:26:00,509 --> 00:26:03,510
But do you think Owen's
mom is Riggs' mom?

564
00:26:03,579 --> 00:26:05,462
Because that has
happened to me before.

565
00:26:07,283 --> 00:26:09,564
Keep me updated
on how he's doing.

566
00:26:11,871 --> 00:26:15,172
So Riggs knows your mother.

567
00:26:15,241 --> 00:26:18,024
Owen, I want to help
you. Just talk to me.

568
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:20,622
Amelia, I'm not like you. I don't
need to talk everything to death.

569
00:26:20,646 --> 00:26:23,747
Listen to what I'm saying. I do
not want your help, not with this.

570
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:42,532
Casey is conscious, but he
might not be able to speak.

571
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:43,921
He can hear you, though.

572
00:26:45,037 --> 00:26:46,803
But he's not hurting?

573
00:26:46,872 --> 00:26:48,973
No, no, we've made
him comfortable, that's...

574
00:26:49,041 --> 00:26:50,107
That's all we can do.

575
00:26:52,078 --> 00:26:53,410
Ruth,

576
00:26:55,014 --> 00:26:57,914
his injuries are quite severe.

577
00:26:59,651 --> 00:27:02,052
You may want to
prepare yourself.

578
00:27:05,591 --> 00:27:07,824
I've been preparing
myself for 30 years.

579
00:27:16,619 --> 00:27:18,918
I'm just gonna sit with
him, if that's all right.

580
00:27:18,987 --> 00:27:20,170
Of course.

581
00:27:21,874 --> 00:27:23,907
Mrs. Hunt, it's none
of my business,

582
00:27:24,744 --> 00:27:26,509
and I'm not asking,

583
00:27:26,578 --> 00:27:29,963
but Owen is my friend,
and I am worried about him.

584
00:27:30,933 --> 00:27:33,350
How worried do I need to be?

585
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:40,574
Close the door, dear.

586
00:28:00,546 --> 00:28:02,312
Hey, old man. Mmm.

587
00:28:06,418 --> 00:28:08,335
They say the fire's almost out.

588
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,340
So this is it.

589
00:28:14,092 --> 00:28:15,258
This is the one, huh?

590
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:18,863
Ah.

591
00:28:21,583 --> 00:28:23,917
Doug and Susan
are on their way, so...

592
00:28:25,604 --> 00:28:28,005
So don't worry,
I won't be alone.

593
00:28:28,074 --> 00:28:29,957
They said that they love you,

594
00:28:30,025 --> 00:28:32,809
and I told them
you love them, too.

595
00:28:34,479 --> 00:28:36,079
I love you.

596
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:41,384
You did good, Casey.

597
00:28:42,304 --> 00:28:43,937
You did good.

598
00:29:21,243 --> 00:29:22,509
You talked to Owen's mother?

599
00:29:23,044 --> 00:29:25,044
Yeah.

600
00:29:25,113 --> 00:29:27,353
What was that about?
Did you find anything out?

601
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:30,183
Meredith!

602
00:29:30,252 --> 00:29:32,219
Look, it's not my
thing. It's Owen's thing,

603
00:29:32,287 --> 00:29:34,287
and he asked me not
to talk about it, so...

604
00:29:34,556 --> 00:29:35,955
He's talking to you?

605
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:37,935
Yeah, he did,
enough so that I can...

606
00:29:37,959 --> 00:29:39,999
Why are you shutting
me out of this?

607
00:29:40,962 --> 00:29:44,464
Because this does
not concern you.

608
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:46,361
But it concerns
you? No, it doesn't.

609
00:29:46,385 --> 00:29:47,584
I made a promise

610
00:29:47,653 --> 00:29:49,231
that I would help him
keep his head above water.

611
00:29:49,255 --> 00:29:50,715
Promised who? To Cristina.

612
00:29:50,739 --> 00:29:54,407
So I am watching him,
and I am letting him be,

613
00:29:54,476 --> 00:29:56,137
and I am not sticking my nose...

614
00:29:56,161 --> 00:29:57,772
What does Cristina
have to do with this?

615
00:29:57,796 --> 00:30:00,029
You're in some sort
of three-way trust circle

616
00:30:00,098 --> 00:30:01,359
with Owen and his ex-girlfriend?

617
00:30:01,383 --> 00:30:03,011
Ex-wife. God, Meredith,

618
00:30:03,035 --> 00:30:06,102
you are the most loyal
person I have ever met

619
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:09,372
to everyone except me.

620
00:30:09,441 --> 00:30:12,142
You're loyal to some woman
halfway across the world...

621
00:30:12,211 --> 00:30:13,755
Yes, I am. When I am right here.

622
00:30:13,779 --> 00:30:17,080
Cristina left you. I'm
here. I'm your sister.

623
00:30:17,132 --> 00:30:20,033
You are not my sister.
Cristina is my sister.

624
00:30:20,102 --> 00:30:22,869
You are Derek's sister,
and Derek is gone.

625
00:30:22,938 --> 00:30:24,988
Dr. Grey, I changed
the mediastinal drains...

626
00:30:25,057 --> 00:30:26,122
Get out!

627
00:30:32,715 --> 00:30:33,947
Is this why you hate me?

628
00:30:35,217 --> 00:30:36,382
'Cause I remind you of him?

629
00:30:37,953 --> 00:30:40,437
Does it help you to hate me?

630
00:30:40,506 --> 00:30:43,386
Asking you not to
push me. Am I like her?

631
00:30:43,425 --> 00:30:45,442
Something you cling to
to keep the memory alive?

632
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,277
You are such a child.

633
00:30:47,346 --> 00:30:51,064
You wrap her around you
like some sick widow shawl.

634
00:30:51,133 --> 00:30:54,267
The widow Grey. She's
okay. She's moving on.

635
00:30:54,336 --> 00:30:56,314
She'll never love again,
but she's holding it together.

636
00:30:56,338 --> 00:30:58,538
That is crap. You've given up.

637
00:30:58,607 --> 00:31:00,607
You are crawling into
your little hole and dying.

638
00:31:00,642 --> 00:31:02,709
You are hollow.

639
00:31:02,778 --> 00:31:05,311
And Derek would be sick
about it if he could see it.

640
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:07,880
He would be disgusted.

641
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:10,670
I want you out of
my house. Done!

642
00:31:19,244 --> 00:31:20,244
Thanks.

643
00:31:25,584 --> 00:31:26,584
Hey.

644
00:31:27,285 --> 00:31:28,301
Are you all right?

645
00:31:29,204 --> 00:31:32,439
You can't touch me at work.

646
00:31:32,507 --> 00:31:36,142
Not in front of people, like
we're together or something.

647
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:38,512
Like we're together?

648
00:31:40,215 --> 00:31:42,110
Right. Well, maybe we should
just stop while we're ahead.

649
00:31:42,134 --> 00:31:43,500
No. I'm just saying...

650
00:31:43,569 --> 00:31:44,895
I know you want to
keep things professional,

651
00:31:44,919 --> 00:31:46,886
but my feelings...

652
00:31:46,955 --> 00:31:50,791
My feelings for you are
not professional. Not at all.

653
00:31:52,444 --> 00:31:56,396
So I'm calling this.

654
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:07,557
Where are you going?

655
00:32:07,626 --> 00:32:10,055
To see my patient. Well,
I just did, and he's fine.

656
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:13,030
Well, if it's all the same
to you... No, it's not.

657
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:14,809
He's stable. Grey has him.

658
00:32:14,833 --> 00:32:17,645
You can just walk away,
walk very far away, in fact.

659
00:32:17,669 --> 00:32:18,985
Owen, listen.

660
00:32:20,822 --> 00:32:22,288
I've already seen Ma.

661
00:32:23,392 --> 00:32:24,991
Okay? We talked. She...

662
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:27,180
Let me make this more clear.

663
00:32:28,096 --> 00:32:30,377
Stay the hell away
from my family.

664
00:32:31,033 --> 00:32:32,532
It's my family, too.

665
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:42,958
No, it's not. It's not
your family. It is mine.

666
00:32:55,273 --> 00:32:58,052
So, just use the crutches
until it doesn't hurt to walk.

667
00:32:58,076 --> 00:33:00,376
It's not the walking
I'm worried about.

668
00:33:00,445 --> 00:33:02,295
It's the sitting.

669
00:33:02,364 --> 00:33:04,408
Well, when your
sitting improves, um...

670
00:33:04,432 --> 00:33:06,661
I wonder if you'd like
to get a cup of coffee.

671
00:33:06,685 --> 00:33:07,685
Charlotte!

672
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:13,273
Alice. Honey, I
told you I was fine.

673
00:33:13,341 --> 00:33:14,935
I know, but then you
didn't pick up your phone,

674
00:33:14,959 --> 00:33:16,559
and I thought...
You're okay, right?

675
00:33:16,628 --> 00:33:19,128
You're okay? Yeah, yeah.

676
00:33:19,197 --> 00:33:21,898
I'm okay, I promise.

677
00:33:21,967 --> 00:33:24,885
This is Dr. Robbins.

678
00:33:24,953 --> 00:33:26,802
She patched up my butt.

679
00:33:26,871 --> 00:33:28,215
Thank you.

680
00:33:28,239 --> 00:33:29,550
Thank you. She has
a really good butt.

681
00:33:29,574 --> 00:33:31,454
Yeah, she... Um, you're welcome.

682
00:33:43,605 --> 00:33:44,654
You flew?

683
00:33:44,723 --> 00:33:46,122
I crashed.

684
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:57,317
Hey. Thank you. Okay. Thank you.

685
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:08,878
Hey. You want help?

686
00:34:08,947 --> 00:34:10,247
No, I don't need help.

687
00:34:10,315 --> 00:34:11,555
I know you don't need it.

688
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:24,544
You debrided, irrigated,
and cleaned all these burns?

689
00:34:24,613 --> 00:34:27,391
Yeah. Despite what some people
think, I know what the hell I'm doing.

690
00:34:27,415 --> 00:34:29,466
I know you...

691
00:34:29,535 --> 00:34:31,855
I'm not saying you're
not a good doctor. I'm...

692
00:34:38,527 --> 00:34:41,260
I'm sorry for everything.

693
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:43,913
We started out together, and
you just blew right past me.

694
00:34:43,982 --> 00:34:46,082
I started to think that...

695
00:34:46,151 --> 00:34:47,862
Jo, if they don't see what a good
surgeon you are, it's not your fault.

696
00:34:47,886 --> 00:34:49,006
It's theirs.

697
00:34:56,127 --> 00:34:57,427
I'm sorry, too.

698
00:35:00,131 --> 00:35:01,131
I miss you.

699
00:35:03,352 --> 00:35:04,484
Me too.

700
00:35:09,741 --> 00:35:12,025
You did well today, Doctor.

701
00:35:12,094 --> 00:35:15,996
Forty-four patients, 19
critical, you lost only one.

702
00:35:16,064 --> 00:35:18,698
Then why do I only feel the one?

703
00:35:18,767 --> 00:35:19,966
That's the job.

704
00:35:20,035 --> 00:35:21,851
"That's the job."

705
00:35:24,155 --> 00:35:27,107
Uh, it appears my doctors
are punching each other.

706
00:35:27,192 --> 00:35:29,512
There's always
a fire to put out.

707
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:34,464
Same place?

708
00:35:34,533 --> 00:35:37,500
I've been dreaming about
those jalapeno poppers.

709
00:35:41,923 --> 00:35:44,891
April! April, come on!

710
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,627
Stop, damn it! Come on.
Jackson, I've had a long day.

711
00:35:47,695 --> 00:35:49,340
Yeah, we should
probably talk about that.

712
00:35:49,364 --> 00:35:51,831
What is there to talk
about? We had sex. That's it.

713
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:55,180
That's not it, and we
should talk about that.

714
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:57,654
Fine.

715
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:00,623
Fine. Talk about it.

716
00:36:01,827 --> 00:36:02,827
We had sex.

717
00:36:03,611 --> 00:36:04,927
We had sex.

718
00:36:05,797 --> 00:36:06,996
And that was...

719
00:36:07,065 --> 00:36:08,092
Confusing. Amazing.

720
00:36:08,116 --> 00:36:09,343
Oh, man. It was...

721
00:36:09,367 --> 00:36:10,728
Sure, it was also
amazing, but this is why I...

722
00:36:10,752 --> 00:36:13,431
See? No! Stop, stop! I'm not
confused about the situation.

723
00:36:13,455 --> 00:36:14,798
I know exactly what it was.

724
00:36:14,822 --> 00:36:17,790
Because it was, it was amazing.

725
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:19,625
It felt good!

726
00:36:19,694 --> 00:36:23,579
For the first time in
forever, it felt like us!

727
00:36:23,648 --> 00:36:26,383
And then, then I saw it.

728
00:36:26,451 --> 00:36:29,052
I saw it on your face, Jackson.

729
00:36:30,054 --> 00:36:31,588
This was it.

730
00:36:31,656 --> 00:36:34,290
This was goodbye.

731
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:35,592
And then I thought,

732
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:38,795
"Well, if we're over,
this is the way to go out."

733
00:36:38,864 --> 00:36:41,197
At least this is what
I want to remember.

734
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:44,166
The amazing.

735
00:36:44,235 --> 00:36:49,038
I wanna end where we
began, in a bed, in love,

736
00:36:49,107 --> 00:36:53,259
and I just wanna keep
us there for a minute.

737
00:36:53,328 --> 00:36:56,696
And anything you say
right now is gonna ruin it,

738
00:36:56,764 --> 00:36:58,665
so please just don't!

739
00:36:58,733 --> 00:37:00,395
Don't you see?
This is what you do.

740
00:37:00,419 --> 00:37:01,695
You just decide how
things are gonna go.

741
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:03,836
I am not the one
deciding in this situation!

742
00:37:03,905 --> 00:37:05,316
Of course you're the
one deciding! What?

743
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:08,074
April, you're always deciding!
You decide to go to Jordan.

744
00:37:08,143 --> 00:37:09,887
You decide to leave,
you decide to stay.

745
00:37:09,911 --> 00:37:11,789
You decide you need me,
then you decide you don't.

746
00:37:11,813 --> 00:37:13,457
You decide we can talk,
you decide we cannot.

747
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:16,216
What? I don't want to talk because
I know what you're gonna say!

748
00:37:16,284 --> 00:37:18,250
You're gonna say
you love me but...

749
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:20,647
You don't know what I'm
going to say! I'm pretty sure I do.

750
00:37:20,671 --> 00:37:24,440
It doesn't matter! You
don't! Fine, then go ahead.

751
00:37:24,509 --> 00:37:25,691
Say it.

752
00:37:27,145 --> 00:37:30,930
Oh, my God, Jackson!
God, please, just say it!

753
00:37:40,608 --> 00:37:42,042
I have feelings, too.

754
00:37:45,097 --> 00:37:48,547
Unprofessional
ones. A lot of them.

755
00:37:50,135 --> 00:37:51,334
I like you.

756
00:37:51,803 --> 00:37:54,104
I just...

757
00:37:54,172 --> 00:37:57,340
I just can't like you at
work. It's difficult for me.

758
00:37:57,409 --> 00:37:58,808
Okay.

759
00:37:58,877 --> 00:38:00,543
So can I like you and...

760
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:04,931
Not like you at work?
Can you do that?

761
00:38:10,956 --> 00:38:11,956
Lock the door.

762
00:38:36,898 --> 00:38:38,397
I need to talk to you.

763
00:38:42,721 --> 00:38:43,831
I need to talk to you.

764
00:38:43,855 --> 00:38:45,955
No, no, no, no, no. Listen.

765
00:38:50,628 --> 00:38:54,297
This isn't working. I need
someone in my corner,

766
00:38:54,366 --> 00:38:57,900
and the more I look at it,
the only person I have is me.

767
00:38:57,969 --> 00:39:00,264
Jo... And I don't want
to make you choose

768
00:39:00,288 --> 00:39:03,089
between me and your
friends, your friend,

769
00:39:03,158 --> 00:39:06,175
but I can't keep feeling like
everyone's second choice,

770
00:39:06,244 --> 00:39:08,745
especially not yours.

771
00:39:08,813 --> 00:39:12,014
So, I'm gonna go stay
with Steph for a while.

772
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:13,115
Jo, stop.

773
00:39:16,154 --> 00:39:18,238
Oh, my God. Alex.

774
00:39:22,994 --> 00:39:24,034
Yeah?

775
00:39:24,712 --> 00:39:27,747
You suck at proposing!

776
00:39:27,816 --> 00:39:29,476
What, you don't
like it? No, it's not...

777
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:31,467
It's when you do it!

778
00:39:31,536 --> 00:39:33,715
Either I'm falling apart,
or you're falling apart,

779
00:39:33,739 --> 00:39:37,089
and then you just do
this crazy, sweeping thing.

780
00:39:37,158 --> 00:39:40,243
What, do you think I
got this at the 7-Eleven?

781
00:39:40,311 --> 00:39:42,445
Mer has been holding
on to this for a month

782
00:39:42,514 --> 00:39:44,781
so you wouldn't see it in my
freaking underwear drawer.

783
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:46,560
All day, she's been
trying to pass it off to me

784
00:39:46,584 --> 00:39:47,917
without you seeing it.

785
00:39:47,986 --> 00:39:49,296
You think this will
make everything okay,

786
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,531
but you don't listen.

787
00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:52,688
I am listening.

788
00:39:52,758 --> 00:39:54,435
You're saying you need
someone in your corner.

789
00:39:54,459 --> 00:39:55,591
I'm right here, Jo.

790
00:39:56,494 --> 00:39:57,593
I'm in your corner.

791
00:39:59,831 --> 00:40:01,597
I've been thinking about tonight

792
00:40:01,666 --> 00:40:03,916
every day since I
left that jewelry store.

793
00:40:03,985 --> 00:40:05,178
I would have asked you sooner,

794
00:40:05,202 --> 00:40:06,580
but this was the first
day on the schedule

795
00:40:06,604 --> 00:40:08,504
that I thought you'd
even be home.

796
00:40:08,573 --> 00:40:10,506
Tonight was the
night, is the night.

797
00:40:14,378 --> 00:40:16,479
I've been listening,
and I'm listening now.

798
00:40:17,181 --> 00:40:18,231
I love you.

799
00:40:22,053 --> 00:40:23,152
Yes or no?

800
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:28,035
<i>When we strike that match,</i>

801
00:40:28,059 --> 00:40:30,059
<i>we like to think we
can control the burn.</i>

802
00:40:44,141 --> 00:40:45,508
Hell of a day, huh?

803
00:40:46,611 --> 00:40:48,928
Can I have a
whiskey, please? Neat.

804
00:40:48,996 --> 00:40:50,356
Sure. Coming right up.

805
00:40:51,433 --> 00:40:52,782
And can I get you one?

806
00:40:52,851 --> 00:40:54,951
<i>We like to think we
have any control at all.</i>

807
00:40:55,019 --> 00:40:56,151
No.

808
00:41:01,826 --> 00:41:03,066
A vodka tonic.

809
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:06,879
Vodka tonic.

810
00:41:06,948 --> 00:41:07,980
Yeah, right away.

811
00:41:11,819 --> 00:41:13,085
Here you go.

812
00:41:13,688 --> 00:41:14,720
Thank you.

813
00:41:15,924 --> 00:41:16,924
Cheers.

814
00:41:27,201 --> 00:41:30,335
<i>But fire is wildly
difficult to contain.</i>

815
00:41:32,356 --> 00:41:35,625
<i>And just when you think
you've extinguished the blaze...</i>

816
00:41:40,398 --> 00:41:42,798
All right, we'll load it up.

817
00:41:43,634 --> 00:41:45,134
Bailey's looking for you.

818
00:41:45,904 --> 00:41:46,936
Okay.

819
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:50,885
You have to pull it together.

820
00:41:50,909 --> 00:41:53,403
You're getting yourself
in trouble. I know.

821
00:41:53,427 --> 00:41:54,944
<i>It reignites.</i>

822
00:41:55,013 --> 00:41:56,412
<i>It sucks in air,</i>

823
00:41:56,481 --> 00:42:00,532
<i>and it burns hotter
and brighter than ever.</i>

824
00:42:05,139 --> 00:42:07,459
You never told me
you had a sister.
