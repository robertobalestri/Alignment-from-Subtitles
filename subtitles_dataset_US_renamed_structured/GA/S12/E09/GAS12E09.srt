1
00:00:06,273 --> 00:00:10,909
Now, who can tell me the
steps of a partial laryngectomy?

2
00:00:10,978 --> 00:00:15,647
<i>In group settings, men are 75%
more likely to speak up than women,</i>

3
00:00:15,716 --> 00:00:18,783
<i>and when a woman does
speak up, it's statistically probable</i>

4
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:21,936
<i>her male counterparts
will either interrupt her</i>

5
00:00:22,005 --> 00:00:23,871
<i>or speak over her.</i>

6
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,240
<i>It's not because they're rude.</i>

7
00:00:25,309 --> 00:00:26,374
Cross.

8
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:27,609
<i>It's science.</i>

9
00:00:27,678 --> 00:00:29,812
<i>The female voice is
scientifically proven</i>

10
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,681
<i>to be more difficult for
a male brain to register.</i>

11
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,249
<i>What does this mean?</i>

12
00:00:34,318 --> 00:00:39,505
<i>It means in this world, where
men are bigger, stronger, faster,</i>

13
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:43,575
<i>if you're not ready to
fight, the silence will kill you.</i>

14
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:45,188
Let's move!

15
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:48,880
This is killing me. We have
not moved in 10 minutes.

16
00:00:50,484 --> 00:00:53,730
I swear that bumblebee has
passed this car twice already.

17
00:00:53,754 --> 00:00:55,820
It passed us, it
circled the earth,

18
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,651
and then came back
around to pass us again.

19
00:00:57,675 --> 00:00:59,936
Yeah, because we left
late because you overslept.

20
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,405
Not fun when you're driving
and someone makes you late.

21
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:04,508
If you want to stay up all night
screwing around with some dude,

22
00:01:04,532 --> 00:01:05,775
I don't care, till you
spend all morning

23
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:07,009
complaining about it in my car.

24
00:01:07,033 --> 00:01:08,260
I don't know what
you're talking about.

25
00:01:08,284 --> 00:01:10,413
We share a wall.

26
00:01:10,437 --> 00:01:11,903
So move out!

27
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:14,134
Nobody told you you could
crash in Amelia's room, anyway!

28
00:01:14,158 --> 00:01:16,925
Okay, that's not
Amelia's room anymore.

29
00:01:16,994 --> 00:01:18,355
What is that? Two fire trucks?

30
00:01:18,379 --> 00:01:19,711
And three ambulances.

31
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:22,092
That's got to be like a
four or five-car pileup.

32
00:01:22,116 --> 00:01:24,749
Fifty bucks says
a big rig's involved.

33
00:01:26,087 --> 00:01:28,269
Hey. Hey! That's
not a good idea.

34
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:29,587
Let's go, Karev.

35
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:32,257
Screw it.

36
00:01:43,537 --> 00:01:45,081
Keps, I could use
another set of hands here!

37
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:46,371
I'm on it!

38
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:50,375
We've been paging
you for half an hour.

39
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:51,638
I've been a little busy.

40
00:01:51,662 --> 00:01:53,302
Let's get him in the field.

41
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:59,267
We got a 45-year-old male with a
head lac, positive LOC on the scene.

42
00:01:59,336 --> 00:02:01,086
Also has abdominal contusion.

43
00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:03,666
I'd like to say it's not
as bad as it looks, but...

44
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:05,469
Major pileup, multiple wounds.

45
00:02:05,493 --> 00:02:07,086
A big rig flipped. Bigger mess.

46
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:08,638
Do you think he has
intra-abdominal injuries?

47
00:02:08,662 --> 00:02:09,806
Well, there's one
way to find out.

48
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:10,973
All right, let's get her inside.

49
00:02:10,997 --> 00:02:12,364
I got this. Go.

50
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:24,343
A bony deformity in
the temporal region.

51
00:02:24,411 --> 00:02:25,811
Five cm head lac.

52
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:26,945
Abdomen's clear.

53
00:02:27,014 --> 00:02:28,763
Palpable pulses in
all four extremities.

54
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:31,115
We've got mild
pupillary asymmetry.

55
00:02:31,185 --> 00:02:32,262
We need to get a head CT.

56
00:02:32,286 --> 00:02:33,896
Let's page neuro. Mmm-hmm.

57
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,072
Starting to regret taking
that tour of the city today.

58
00:02:37,141 --> 00:02:40,075
No rain. Thought
it was a good idea.

59
00:02:40,143 --> 00:02:41,505
I got more than I bargained for.

60
00:02:41,529 --> 00:02:42,672
Yeah, hey, this is
Dr. Warren here.

61
00:02:42,696 --> 00:02:44,374
Well, you did hit your
head pretty good, Lou.

62
00:02:44,398 --> 00:02:45,809
But we're gonna
get you fixed up.

63
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,794
Wasn't my most
graceful landing, either.

64
00:02:47,818 --> 00:02:48,861
Yeah, sure. I'll hold.

65
00:02:48,885 --> 00:02:50,685
Pushing 150 of fentanyl.

66
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:52,198
This should help with the pain.

67
00:02:52,222 --> 00:02:54,184
You know they had
a wall at Pike's Market

68
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:56,219
covered in people's chewing gum?

69
00:02:56,243 --> 00:02:59,044
I do, in fact, know that,
Lou. I grew up here.

70
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:00,673
Mmm. BENJAMIN: Thanks.

71
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:02,926
Where's neuro?

72
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:04,065
Paged. No response.

73
00:03:04,134 --> 00:03:05,200
Well, then go get them.

74
00:03:08,738 --> 00:03:09,978
Any pain here, Lou?

75
00:03:10,007 --> 00:03:11,701
Just a little sore. Little sore?

76
00:03:12,927 --> 00:03:14,542
He's lost his pulse!

77
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:16,756
All right, cover your ears. Why?

78
00:03:18,181 --> 00:03:19,275
That's why.

79
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:21,244
I want an hourly neuro
checks on bed six,

80
00:03:21,268 --> 00:03:22,633
sign off on beds four and eight.

81
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:23,880
Bed seven. What?

82
00:03:23,904 --> 00:03:25,832
Bed seven. We don't
have a patient in bed eight.

83
00:03:25,856 --> 00:03:27,422
Right. So busy in here,

84
00:03:27,491 --> 00:03:29,435
who can remember?

85
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:30,725
We're being paged to...

86
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:32,177
Trauma One. Dr. Grey.

87
00:03:32,246 --> 00:03:34,606
And Trauma Three. Dr. Hunt.
Uh, both urgent, not critical.

88
00:03:34,648 --> 00:03:36,476
Do you want Hunt first or Grey?

89
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,978
Dr. Grey told me
to come find you.

90
00:03:38,002 --> 00:03:40,168
Really? Meredith
actually asked for me,

91
00:03:40,237 --> 00:03:42,003
or did she just want
neuro in general?

92
00:03:42,089 --> 00:03:43,233
I don't remember.

93
00:03:43,257 --> 00:03:44,956
Yeah, you do.

94
00:03:45,025 --> 00:03:47,620
Have Grey give us a page if
her patient becomes critical.

95
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:49,055
Where's Hunt?
Trauma Three, right?

96
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:50,578
Three.

97
00:03:50,648 --> 00:03:52,825
We'll be there in
less than 10 minutes.

98
00:03:52,849 --> 00:03:54,394
Dr. Warren, some
help over here, please.

99
00:03:54,418 --> 00:03:56,918
Coming through!

100
00:03:56,987 --> 00:03:59,165
I need O2 tanks over
here for transport.

101
00:03:59,189 --> 00:04:01,289
We're out here
visiting my sister.

102
00:04:01,357 --> 00:04:03,825
She and my kids
are on a girls' day out,

103
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:06,127
so I decided to go
see the Space Needle.

104
00:04:06,196 --> 00:04:08,730
Now I'm seeing
all kinds of needles.

105
00:04:11,502 --> 00:04:13,968
Yeah, it's corny.
I know. I'm sorry.

106
00:04:14,038 --> 00:04:16,371
My daughters tell me I
make the worst jokes.

107
00:04:16,457 --> 00:04:19,307
How many kids do you have?

108
00:04:19,376 --> 00:04:22,210
Uh, two. They're 10 and six.

109
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:25,546
Aw, sweet. They are smart, man.

110
00:04:25,615 --> 00:04:27,615
They're smarter than I...

111
00:04:29,052 --> 00:04:31,720
Whoa! Okay. What
are we looking at?

112
00:04:31,788 --> 00:04:32,871
Um...

113
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,033
Come on, speak up!

114
00:04:34,057 --> 00:04:35,223
Tonic-clonic seizure.

115
00:04:35,292 --> 00:04:36,686
That's right. Let's roll him.

116
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:38,877
One, two, three.

117
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:40,624
Okay, what do we do now?

118
00:04:40,648 --> 00:04:44,008
- We wait for it to pass.
- We wait for it to pass.

119
00:04:44,852 --> 00:04:46,913
It's going on too long.
We need 10 of lorazepam.

120
00:04:46,937 --> 00:04:48,857
It's locked in pharma. Go, now.

121
00:04:50,073 --> 00:04:52,354
It's okay, Lou. I got you.

122
00:04:58,598 --> 00:05:01,516
Ooh, that was a big one.

123
00:05:03,253 --> 00:05:04,352
Okay.

124
00:05:07,357 --> 00:05:08,456
Okay.

125
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,010
Okay.

126
00:05:14,315 --> 00:05:15,947
All right.

127
00:05:16,016 --> 00:05:18,811
Oh, he's gonna need a
new gown and fresh sheets.

128
00:05:18,835 --> 00:05:20,664
Oh, I hate it when they do
that. Could you get an orderly?

129
00:05:20,688 --> 00:05:22,504
Do you mind? Okay.

130
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:32,275
Be right back. Okay.

131
00:05:32,299 --> 00:05:34,143
Hey, there's no rush,
but if you do see neuro,

132
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,211
get them up here, please.

133
00:05:35,235 --> 00:05:36,667
Mmm-hmm.

134
00:05:38,621 --> 00:05:39,955
Okay, Lou.

135
00:06:55,682 --> 00:06:57,215
Lou?

136
00:06:58,985 --> 00:07:00,268
Lou.

137
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:02,603
You need to lay down.
You shouldn't be up.

138
00:07:02,673 --> 00:07:04,289
Lou.

139
00:07:04,358 --> 00:07:05,638
Let's get back on the bed, Lou.

140
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:19,345
Coming through!

141
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:21,132
I need that chest X-ray!

142
00:07:22,476 --> 00:07:24,842
V-fib, charge to 300.

143
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:26,478
Charged.

144
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:28,291
All right. All right, ready?

145
00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:29,515
Clear!

146
00:07:31,401 --> 00:07:34,802
Come on. Come on,
come on, come on.

147
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:36,437
All right. Clear!

148
00:07:38,642 --> 00:07:39,874
Come on.

149
00:07:45,281 --> 00:07:47,649
Okay. I'm calling it.

150
00:07:48,752 --> 00:07:51,719
Time of death, 11:42.

151
00:07:54,091 --> 00:07:56,191
Crap.

152
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:58,537
I really thought we had him.

153
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:00,061
Yeah, me, too.

154
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:02,073
I need some help in here now!

155
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:07,011
Trauma panel. Send
blood for a crossmatch.

156
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,041
Belly is soft. APRIL:
Bruising on the left chest.

157
00:09:09,065 --> 00:09:10,410
Decreased breath
sounds on the left.

158
00:09:10,434 --> 00:09:11,561
Art line is going in.

159
00:09:11,585 --> 00:09:14,101
Pulse ox is down to 88.

160
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:16,137
For a trauma series.
Hook up those monitors.

161
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:17,956
You'll need a wide bore IV.

162
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:20,570
Get ortho here to add
some left arm and leg films.

163
00:09:20,594 --> 00:09:22,538
Has anyone told the chief?
Okay, do not page her.

164
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,657
This is one patient. We
can do this one, okay?

165
00:09:24,681 --> 00:09:26,125
She has to handle
everything else.

166
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:28,900
The guy who did this, he
was stable, non-aggressive.

167
00:09:28,969 --> 00:09:30,318
He wasn't a threat.

168
00:09:30,387 --> 00:09:32,332
I left for, like, five
minutes, and this happens.

169
00:09:32,356 --> 00:09:35,056
He was postictal. Hyper-aggression
can occur after a seizure.

170
00:09:35,124 --> 00:09:37,436
Temporary fugue state.
He won't even remember it.

171
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:39,288
- Where is he now?
- Restrained,

172
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:41,272
and being treated
right next door.

173
00:09:44,934 --> 00:09:46,229
Vein's collapsed.
I can't get in.

174
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:47,802
Put in a central line.

175
00:09:47,871 --> 00:09:49,271
I got it. RICHARD: Oh, okay.

176
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:53,691
Obvious dislocation
of the left elbow.

177
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,460
We got some left knee swelling.

178
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:58,374
Rib fractures on the left
with palpable crepitus.

179
00:09:58,398 --> 00:10:00,243
Get ortho here. Have a
liter of bringers on standby.

180
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:02,611
Get a blood gas from the art line.
- We need a wide bore IV.

181
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:04,675
No obvious flail.

182
00:10:07,123 --> 00:10:10,083
You're doing just
fine, okay? Just fine.

183
00:10:11,995 --> 00:10:13,723
Damn it. Send for a
trauma panel and a cross.

184
00:10:13,747 --> 00:10:15,041
Somebody get Jackson
in here, right now!

185
00:10:15,065 --> 00:10:16,475
Grey. NURSE: I'm on it.

186
00:10:16,499 --> 00:10:17,643
Grey, we're gonna shoot
a quick X-ray, all right?

187
00:10:17,667 --> 00:10:19,507
No JVD. Hi. I'm here.

188
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,537
I'm here.

189
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:39,637
One, two, three, easy.

190
00:10:39,706 --> 00:10:42,056
Easy, easy, easy,
easy. Okay. Easy.

191
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:43,224
All right, okay.

192
00:10:43,292 --> 00:10:45,626
All right, everybody back.

193
00:10:45,695 --> 00:10:47,395
Okay. All right,
ready? On three.

194
00:10:47,464 --> 00:10:49,180
One, two, three.

195
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:51,916
All right, easy.

196
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:53,462
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Meredith, it's okay.

197
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:55,197
It's okay, it's okay.

198
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:57,421
It's okay. It's okay.

199
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,801
We're here. What have we...

200
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:00,570
Possible concussion,
head contusions,

201
00:11:00,594 --> 00:11:02,554
multiple blunt-force blows
to the head and neck.

202
00:11:03,647 --> 00:11:06,380
It's... It's Grey. I'm
sorry. I thought you knew.

203
00:11:06,449 --> 00:11:07,689
Dr. Shepherd?

204
00:11:09,486 --> 00:11:10,835
Dr. Shepherd.

205
00:11:11,738 --> 00:11:13,004
Dr. Shepherd!

206
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:15,767
Here's the films.

207
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:16,969
Pressure's 90 over 60.

208
00:11:16,993 --> 00:11:18,438
Okay, she's got 30% pneumo.

209
00:11:18,462 --> 00:11:20,038
No obvious effusion.
She needs a chest tube.

210
00:11:20,062 --> 00:11:22,407
I need a 36 tube, Betadine,
and six and a half gloves.

211
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:23,881
Set up the Pleur-evac.

212
00:11:29,873 --> 00:11:31,667
Just got labs. Crit is stable.

213
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,602
Oh, good. Draw blood
gas from the A-line.

214
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:34,737
What is this? What
the hell happened?

215
00:11:34,761 --> 00:11:35,905
She was attacked by a patient.

216
00:11:35,929 --> 00:11:37,340
The neck is bruised and swollen.

217
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:38,696
She needs an airway evaluation.

218
00:11:38,765 --> 00:11:40,109
All right, I'm on it, I'm on it.

219
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:42,261
No, uh, bony deformity.
Positive Battle's sign.

220
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:44,363
Okay, Meredith, we're gonna
have to put in a chest tube, all right?

221
00:11:44,387 --> 00:11:45,627
Your lung is collapsing.

222
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:52,237
And this is gonna burn.
I'm injecting the lido.

223
00:11:52,261 --> 00:11:53,556
You can't work on your family.

224
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:55,680
Everybody in this
damn room is her family.

225
00:11:55,749 --> 00:11:57,429
It's fine. OWEN: Here we go.

226
00:12:04,007 --> 00:12:06,118
- Breathe, Mer. Breathe, breathe.
- Chest tube is in.

227
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:07,453
Okay, easy, easy,
easy, easy, easy.

228
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:08,771
Okay, let's hook
up the Pleur-evac.

229
00:12:08,795 --> 00:12:10,635
Pulse ox is coming
back up. Eighty-eight, 90.

230
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:18,886
No evidence of traumatic brain
injury. No, no, no focal deficits.

231
00:12:18,954 --> 00:12:23,023
Uh, except, uh, uh, Dr. Grey, I
need you to move your fingers for me.

232
00:12:25,795 --> 00:12:27,261
Or your toes.

233
00:12:30,884 --> 00:12:32,729
Come on. Just come
on. Wiggle something.

234
00:12:32,753 --> 00:12:35,013
She responded to the painful
stimulus. It doesn't make sense.

235
00:12:35,037 --> 00:12:36,549
Pulse ox is dropping again.

236
00:12:36,573 --> 00:12:38,422
Unless...

237
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:40,103
The chest tube
has a small air leak.

238
00:12:40,127 --> 00:12:41,837
No, she has mild
sub-Q emphysema.

239
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:43,689
We need to secure
this airway and tube her.

240
00:12:43,713 --> 00:12:45,307
Got it. Guys.

241
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:46,609
Guys, I don't think
she can hear us.

242
00:12:46,633 --> 00:12:47,693
What? OWEN: What?

243
00:12:47,717 --> 00:12:49,717
Are you sure? No. Mer.

244
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:56,802
I can see evidence
of barotrauma,

245
00:12:56,826 --> 00:12:58,053
possibly from the blows.

246
00:12:58,077 --> 00:12:59,304
I think Karev might be right.

247
00:12:59,328 --> 00:13:01,328
I don't think she can
hear anything we're saying.

248
00:13:02,832 --> 00:13:04,576
Her jaw is locked. Suction!

249
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,517
Suction. Can we take a look?

250
00:13:06,586 --> 00:13:08,069
All right. Let me see.

251
00:13:08,137 --> 00:13:09,682
Yeah, yeah, easy, easy.

252
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:11,584
Yeah, we've got a dislocation
here, possible fracture.

253
00:13:11,608 --> 00:13:13,169
There's no way we're
getting a tube in there.

254
00:13:13,193 --> 00:13:16,027
You have to get a tube in.
You have to preserve her airway.

255
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:17,940
- Or we have to trach her.
- No, no, no, um...

256
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:19,004
All right, wait a second.

257
00:13:19,065 --> 00:13:20,564
If I can reduce the dislocation,

258
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,562
we can probably get her mouth
open just enough to intubate.

259
00:13:22,586 --> 00:13:24,786
It's gonna hurt
like hell, though.

260
00:13:24,854 --> 00:13:25,982
Okay. Hang tight. Okay.

261
00:13:26,006 --> 00:13:28,322
I'm sorry. Here. Okay, Mer.

262
00:13:28,391 --> 00:13:30,941
Okay, we're gonna have
to pop your jaw open, okay?

263
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,743
I'm sorry. I know.
But we have to do it.

264
00:13:32,813 --> 00:13:34,657
And we're gonna do this on
the count of three, you guys.

265
00:13:34,681 --> 00:13:36,881
Ready? One, two...

266
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,520
Mer.

267
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:03,208
Hi.

268
00:16:18,294 --> 00:16:19,694
See you in there.

269
00:18:31,544 --> 00:18:32,744
You want to see.

270
00:20:30,629 --> 00:20:31,728
Hey.

271
00:20:32,765 --> 00:20:34,898
What's wrong? What can I do?

272
00:20:47,046 --> 00:20:48,712
Hey. It's okay.

273
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,515
I'm here.

274
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:12,652
Just get it out, get it all out.

275
00:21:13,756 --> 00:21:15,555
The tears, all the...

276
00:21:18,761 --> 00:21:21,528
You know, you've
got a lot of snot.

277
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:25,266
I'm serious, I'm for real.

278
00:21:25,334 --> 00:21:28,202
I mean, you might
have a serious condition.

279
00:21:29,571 --> 00:21:32,072
Come on, woman.
Blow your damn nose.

280
00:21:33,842 --> 00:21:35,242
Hang on.

281
00:21:35,511 --> 00:21:37,511
Mer.

282
00:21:37,579 --> 00:21:39,380
Can you hear me?

283
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:41,181
Mmm.

284
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:42,890
You can hear me? Mmm-hmm.

285
00:21:42,952 --> 00:21:44,702
You can hear me?

286
00:21:44,754 --> 00:21:46,154
Mmm-hmm.

287
00:21:46,222 --> 00:21:47,904
Oh, my God!

288
00:21:48,774 --> 00:21:49,774
Oh!

289
00:22:00,386 --> 00:22:03,254
It is important that you
continue the voice rest, okay?

290
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:06,323
Your tracheal injury
is not fully healed,

291
00:22:06,392 --> 00:22:07,824
and your latest audiometry shows

292
00:22:07,893 --> 00:22:09,860
that the hearing
in your right ear

293
00:22:09,928 --> 00:22:12,429
has almost completely returned.

294
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:15,549
On your left, you're looking
at about 55%, which is good.

295
00:22:15,618 --> 00:22:18,451
It's only been a few weeks, you
know, so I'm not concerned about it.

296
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:21,472
It's gonna come
back, Meredith, okay?

297
00:22:21,541 --> 00:22:22,601
I want you to continue to...

298
00:22:22,625 --> 00:22:23,957
Mmm.

299
00:22:24,026 --> 00:22:25,237
I want you to continue

300
00:22:25,261 --> 00:22:26,871
to move your fingers
while in the cast,

301
00:22:26,895 --> 00:22:28,740
and you will remain
non-weight-bearing

302
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:30,731
on your leg until
we take the cast off.

303
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:34,079
Yeah, well, there's a little
swelling in that left leg.

304
00:22:34,103 --> 00:22:36,215
Uh, it's probably local edema,

305
00:22:36,239 --> 00:22:38,683
but I've ordered a
Doppler, just to be safe.

306
00:22:38,707 --> 00:22:41,141
Anything else? No.

307
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:43,050
Mmm.

308
00:22:47,967 --> 00:22:50,145
"Lou?" What's... Who's Lou?

309
00:22:50,169 --> 00:22:52,336
The patient who
attacked Meredith.

310
00:22:52,405 --> 00:22:53,681
I've been calling
him something else.

311
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:56,674
Now, look, we don't have
to go into that right now.

312
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,393
She wants to know. Tell her.

313
00:23:01,396 --> 00:23:02,880
Okay.

314
00:23:02,949 --> 00:23:06,283
Lou suffered a severe epidural
hematoma in the accident.

315
00:23:06,351 --> 00:23:07,768
It's what caused the seizure.

316
00:23:07,837 --> 00:23:12,706
We think he was in a postictal
state when he attacked.

317
00:23:12,775 --> 00:23:14,975
After a few minutes, he woke up

318
00:23:15,043 --> 00:23:17,310
and had no idea
what he had done.

319
00:23:17,379 --> 00:23:20,214
He had surgery
and was discharged.

320
00:23:20,299 --> 00:23:21,398
Uh, he's doing fine.

321
00:23:21,467 --> 00:23:22,532
Mmm.

322
00:23:25,454 --> 00:23:27,554
Lou has reached out.

323
00:23:27,622 --> 00:23:30,290
He has made a couple
of requests to see you.

324
00:23:30,359 --> 00:23:31,875
Mmm-hmm.

325
00:23:31,944 --> 00:23:33,944
I think he would
just like to apologize.

326
00:23:34,013 --> 00:23:35,345
It's okay.

327
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:39,603
- She's kicking us out. Let's go.
- Mmm. Mmm-hmm.

328
00:23:41,037 --> 00:23:43,103
Go ahead.

329
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:47,607
Apologize? Are you serious?

330
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:48,821
Of course I'm serious.

331
00:23:48,845 --> 00:23:50,845
Yeah, I don't see why.

332
00:23:50,913 --> 00:23:52,891
Because the last time that woman
got hurt working for this hospital,

333
00:23:52,915 --> 00:23:54,681
she purchased this hospital.

334
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:56,150
That is why.

335
00:23:56,219 --> 00:23:58,496
And what do you think will
happen if she sees him again?

336
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,982
- Nothing good.
- Exactly.

337
00:24:32,538 --> 00:24:33,538
Mmm.

338
00:24:52,041 --> 00:24:54,207
Good, good.

339
00:24:57,479 --> 00:25:00,047
All right. Try and
lift your leg for me.

340
00:25:00,115 --> 00:25:02,396
Good, good. Decent mobility.

341
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:09,957
I don't know.

342
00:25:10,026 --> 00:25:11,937
Well, we're done,
and it's all good, so...

343
00:25:11,961 --> 00:25:13,601
Thanks.

344
00:25:15,831 --> 00:25:17,364
Uh...

345
00:25:17,433 --> 00:25:21,602
He has been working a lot of
night shifts, and she's been...

346
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:23,648
They haven't been talking,

347
00:25:23,672 --> 00:25:27,540
I don't think, or hanging or
anything, uh, from what I can tell.

348
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:29,509
So, anyway.

349
00:25:29,578 --> 00:25:31,538
Let's do this again.

350
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:34,047
Follow the pen.

351
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:40,254
Okay, this isn't
exactly the right shade,

352
00:25:40,322 --> 00:25:44,158
but it's doing a pretty good
job of covering the bruising.

353
00:25:44,226 --> 00:25:45,526
All right.

354
00:25:45,594 --> 00:25:47,361
So...

355
00:25:47,429 --> 00:25:49,029
Don't try and get up, okay?

356
00:25:49,097 --> 00:25:50,814
Just let them come to you.

357
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,283
And smile.

358
00:25:53,352 --> 00:25:57,020
But try not to open your mouth
because it's still pretty swollen in there

359
00:25:57,089 --> 00:26:00,940
and the wires, the metal
wires, they're a little scary.

360
00:26:05,965 --> 00:26:07,881
You ready? Okay, all right.

361
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:15,639
Hey, hey, hey!

362
00:26:15,691 --> 00:26:17,218
Look who's here, guys!

363
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:19,709
Your mommy is so excited
to see you! Come here.

364
00:26:19,779 --> 00:26:21,373
Come on in. Go
ahead. Go tell her.

365
00:26:21,397 --> 00:26:22,573
Tell her what we
talked about, okay?

366
00:26:22,597 --> 00:26:23,948
I don't want to.

367
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,532
Oh, come on, Zola.

368
00:26:25,601 --> 00:26:27,645
You ask me every day,
"When can we go see Mommy?"

369
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:29,503
Look. She's right over there.

370
00:26:29,571 --> 00:26:30,865
Go give her a big hug!

371
00:26:30,889 --> 00:26:32,122
No!

372
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:34,625
No, no, no!

373
00:26:34,693 --> 00:26:36,533
Zozo, come see Mommy.

374
00:26:37,079 --> 00:26:38,345
I want to go.

375
00:26:38,413 --> 00:26:39,680
Come on.

376
00:26:41,516 --> 00:26:43,294
Zozo, come see Mommy, honey.

377
00:26:43,318 --> 00:26:44,818
Zo. Come on! Come on.

378
00:26:44,887 --> 00:26:47,471
Zozo! Come see Mommy, honey!

379
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:48,839
Come on, honey!

380
00:26:48,907 --> 00:26:50,747
Come on, Zo!

381
00:26:51,894 --> 00:26:53,538
Come on, honey. Please.

382
00:26:53,562 --> 00:26:54,906
Let's go talk to her. You
know... You know what?

383
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:57,025
Let's just, um... Let's
do this later. Come on.

384
00:26:57,049 --> 00:27:00,129
It's... Let's do this later.
It's not... It's not okay.

385
00:27:01,487 --> 00:27:03,415
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

386
00:27:03,439 --> 00:27:05,456
Let's do this later.
Let's do this later.

387
00:27:05,524 --> 00:27:07,190
We're gonna do it later, okay?

388
00:27:07,259 --> 00:27:09,359
We're gonna do it later. Okay.

389
00:27:09,428 --> 00:27:12,930
Okay, does anybody want
anything yummy from the cafeteria?

390
00:27:12,998 --> 00:27:14,331
All right.

391
00:27:15,901 --> 00:27:17,267
Okay, Zola!

392
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:28,545
Dr. Robbins wanted...

393
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:32,699
Dr. Grey. Okay, okay.

394
00:27:32,768 --> 00:27:34,834
I can't breathe!
Okay, you're okay.

395
00:27:34,904 --> 00:27:36,787
Hang on, hang on. Deep breath.

396
00:27:36,856 --> 00:27:38,789
Deep breath. I need
you to breathe for me.

397
00:27:38,858 --> 00:27:41,324
Breathe for me,
Dr. Grey. Breathe.

398
00:27:42,828 --> 00:27:45,328
Stay still. Stay still.

399
00:27:45,397 --> 00:27:47,814
I'm gonna get you
some air. Just stay still.

400
00:27:47,882 --> 00:27:49,900
I'm gonna open you up, okay?

401
00:27:49,969 --> 00:27:53,170
Okay. I'm opening you
up. Stay still. Please.

402
00:27:53,856 --> 00:27:54,888
Okay.

403
00:28:01,646 --> 00:28:02,746
Okay.

404
00:28:03,716 --> 00:28:04,948
Hold on.

405
00:28:07,786 --> 00:28:09,119
All right. Good.

406
00:28:09,188 --> 00:28:10,804
Hey, what the
hell are you doing?

407
00:28:10,873 --> 00:28:13,040
She was having a panic
attack. She couldn't breathe.

408
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:14,702
Do you not realize how
delicate the jaw actually is?

409
00:28:14,726 --> 00:28:16,037
Dr. Avery, she...
You could jeopardize

410
00:28:16,061 --> 00:28:17,627
the entire healing process here.

411
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:19,791
She couldn't
breathe! Look at her!

412
00:28:19,815 --> 00:28:22,315
She's been stuck in this
room in that bed for weeks!

413
00:28:22,401 --> 00:28:24,046
She can't move! She can't talk!

414
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:25,786
But I'm her surgeon now, right?

415
00:28:25,854 --> 00:28:27,615
You can't come in here
and just take out her wires.

416
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:29,389
She is my patient!

417
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:31,742
I know what I am doing!

418
00:28:31,794 --> 00:28:34,127
You can rewire her
jaw tomorrow morning,

419
00:28:34,196 --> 00:28:37,230
but right now she needed some
air, so I got her some damn air!

420
00:28:49,662 --> 00:28:51,406
I brought you
something to eat...

421
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:52,807
Drink.

422
00:28:52,831 --> 00:28:54,998
I know. I'm sorry.

423
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:56,382
Good morning!

424
00:28:57,453 --> 00:28:59,213
Oh, come on. Or not.

425
00:29:01,524 --> 00:29:02,764
How's the pain today?

426
00:29:05,294 --> 00:29:06,960
And the discomfort?

427
00:29:07,029 --> 00:29:08,890
Well, her energy's up.
- All right.

428
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:11,593
I'm sorry. I have all of five
minutes to update you on the miracle

429
00:29:11,617 --> 00:29:14,083
that I've been working
on your service this week,

430
00:29:14,152 --> 00:29:16,669
but it seems like a bad time.

431
00:29:16,738 --> 00:29:19,423
Uh, I'm gonna check
in and update you later.

432
00:29:20,692 --> 00:29:23,460
Maybe we all
could check in later.

433
00:29:24,964 --> 00:29:26,204
Yeah.

434
00:29:27,732 --> 00:29:29,366
I'm just gonna

435
00:29:30,902 --> 00:29:32,235
leave that.

436
00:29:49,838 --> 00:29:51,338
Oh, what happened?

437
00:29:51,406 --> 00:29:53,566
What was that?
Everything okay in there?

438
00:29:56,328 --> 00:29:57,995
Nurse's station.

439
00:29:58,063 --> 00:29:59,396
Yeah, okay. I got it.

440
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:00,984
You don't want to
look at me. I get it.

441
00:30:04,503 --> 00:30:06,803
Do you think that I
want to be out there

442
00:30:06,872 --> 00:30:08,483
hanging out outside your door

443
00:30:08,507 --> 00:30:10,018
like some pathetic little
rat looking for scraps?

444
00:30:10,042 --> 00:30:12,487
Do you think that
feels good for me?

445
00:30:12,511 --> 00:30:14,277
I...

446
00:30:14,346 --> 00:30:16,691
I have been out there trying to
figure out how to make amends.

447
00:30:16,715 --> 00:30:19,115
As if that would matter to you.

448
00:30:29,712 --> 00:30:31,445
I know I'm a mess,

449
00:30:31,513 --> 00:30:33,692
who talks too much
and feels too much,

450
00:30:33,716 --> 00:30:36,316
and I know that it
drives you crazy.

451
00:30:36,384 --> 00:30:38,680
But that is the one way I
know how to stay sober.

452
00:30:38,704 --> 00:30:40,815
And every time
I try to suck it up

453
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,917
and shut up and just
be cold and normal,

454
00:30:42,941 --> 00:30:44,307
I end up drunk.

455
00:30:44,376 --> 00:30:46,776
Or on pills or at a funeral.

456
00:30:51,283 --> 00:30:53,461
Do you know what it felt like
to walk into that trauma room

457
00:30:53,485 --> 00:30:55,563
and see you on that
table and think to myself,

458
00:30:55,587 --> 00:30:59,405
"Great. I did it again. Here
comes another funeral."

459
00:31:05,464 --> 00:31:06,963
You know what?

460
00:31:07,666 --> 00:31:09,199
Forget it. I...

461
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:14,070
I don't even know
why I came in here.

462
00:31:35,394 --> 00:31:36,634
Hello.

463
00:31:40,649 --> 00:31:44,267
Cross, let's get
Dr. Grey a wheelchair.

464
00:32:18,587 --> 00:32:21,304
I understand you saw Amelia.

465
00:32:21,373 --> 00:32:24,407
Hey, look, look. I know you're
not in the mood for a lecture.

466
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:30,547
But... Are you finished?

467
00:32:37,873 --> 00:32:40,941
She came to see you
the night after the attack.

468
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:43,209
She was drunk.

469
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:47,614
She was upset

470
00:32:47,683 --> 00:32:51,618
because you called
her for a consult that day,

471
00:32:53,188 --> 00:32:55,955
the day of the attack.

472
00:32:56,024 --> 00:32:58,992
And she had a choice
between coming to you

473
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:01,194
and going to another trauma,

474
00:33:02,264 --> 00:33:04,798
and she went to the other trauma

475
00:33:04,867 --> 00:33:06,266
because she was mad at you.

476
00:33:11,907 --> 00:33:14,708
Forgiveness is a
powerful thing, Meredith.

477
00:33:17,345 --> 00:33:20,446
Not only to make the
other person feel good,

478
00:33:21,883 --> 00:33:23,382
but to heal you.

479
00:33:26,372 --> 00:33:28,805
You need to forgive
her, Meredith.

480
00:33:30,876 --> 00:33:33,109
Forgive her for not being Derek.

481
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,530
For being the wrong Shepherd,

482
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:41,101
just enough to remind
you of what's missing,

483
00:33:41,169 --> 00:33:43,803
but not enough
to bring him back.

484
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,240
That's not her fault.

485
00:33:48,376 --> 00:33:50,343
You need to forgive her.

486
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:54,430
You don't have to like her.

487
00:33:55,266 --> 00:33:57,366
You don't have to love her.

488
00:33:59,104 --> 00:34:02,072
But forgive her, okay?

489
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:07,410
So you can forgive Blake
for being in that room

490
00:34:07,478 --> 00:34:10,379
when a wrong decision
cost you your husband.

491
00:34:13,135 --> 00:34:16,636
To forgive Derek
for dying too soon.

492
00:34:19,925 --> 00:34:22,559
To forgive yourself

493
00:34:22,628 --> 00:34:25,061
for hating him
for dying too soon.

494
00:34:31,002 --> 00:34:32,769
Let it go, Meredith.

495
00:34:35,407 --> 00:34:36,807
And forgive.

496
00:34:47,552 --> 00:34:50,253
Sun feels good on
the face, doesn't it?

497
00:34:53,158 --> 00:34:54,869
What the hell is the
point of counseling, then,

498
00:34:54,893 --> 00:34:58,027
if you're just gonna suddenly,
without even talking about it...

499
00:34:58,097 --> 00:34:59,896
Oh, come on. All
we do is talk, April.

500
00:34:59,965 --> 00:35:02,248
So, what? You just, you
just serve me papers?

501
00:35:02,317 --> 00:35:05,551
Just like that? Just no
warning. No, no any...

502
00:35:05,637 --> 00:35:09,005
Do you have any idea what
a slap in the face this is?

503
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:13,676
Are you kidding me?

504
00:35:15,347 --> 00:35:17,580
You ready?

505
00:35:35,349 --> 00:35:37,050
Hi, Dr. Grey.

506
00:35:37,118 --> 00:35:38,118
Lou.

507
00:35:38,903 --> 00:35:40,143
Um...

508
00:35:40,872 --> 00:35:43,112
Thank you for meeting me.

509
00:35:53,285 --> 00:35:55,251
This is my wife, Joanne.

510
00:35:56,521 --> 00:35:57,720
My daughter, Kylie.

511
00:35:57,789 --> 00:36:00,923
I told you about her, the
youngest, really smart.

512
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,494
And that's my Anne.

513
00:36:06,098 --> 00:36:07,663
Um...

514
00:36:07,732 --> 00:36:10,033
Um, have a seat, girls.

515
00:36:10,102 --> 00:36:12,185
Uh, you got kids?

516
00:36:14,789 --> 00:36:16,356
Right.

517
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:19,058
Forgot you can't talk, the...

518
00:36:19,127 --> 00:36:20,367
The jaw.

519
00:36:20,962 --> 00:36:22,162
Um...

520
00:36:25,434 --> 00:36:26,933
I wanted to...

521
00:36:30,439 --> 00:36:32,759
I didn't know what I was doing.

522
00:36:33,741 --> 00:36:35,074
What I did to you...

523
00:36:37,411 --> 00:36:39,362
I didn't know.

524
00:36:39,431 --> 00:36:41,030
I would never...

525
00:36:42,166 --> 00:36:45,201
I would never hurt a woman.

526
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:49,705
And I...

527
00:36:50,575 --> 00:36:52,608
I just want you...

528
00:36:52,677 --> 00:36:55,378
I just want you to
know that I'm sorry.

529
00:36:58,983 --> 00:37:00,383
Truly sorry.

530
00:38:00,428 --> 00:38:02,194
It's my 30-day chip.

531
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:05,915
I'm sober.

532
00:38:05,984 --> 00:38:08,785
And I'm starting back
at work on Monday, so...

533
00:38:09,387 --> 00:38:10,753
I'm trying.

534
00:38:14,326 --> 00:38:15,692
I'm trying.

535
00:38:19,364 --> 00:38:20,896
I know you are.

536
00:38:23,785 --> 00:38:25,818
You...

537
00:38:25,887 --> 00:38:28,265
You can talk. That, um...

538
00:38:28,289 --> 00:38:31,991
That's great. They,
uh, took the wires off?

539
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:33,526
Yeah, this morning.

540
00:38:40,802 --> 00:38:43,402
I'm just not ready
to forgive you yet.

541
00:38:47,509 --> 00:38:48,708
I'm not

542
00:38:51,045 --> 00:38:52,928
exactly ready, either.

543
00:38:57,586 --> 00:38:59,085
See you later.

544
00:38:59,871 --> 00:39:01,371
See you later.

545
00:39:46,434 --> 00:39:47,434
Hmm.

546
00:40:04,418 --> 00:40:05,468
Mer.

547
00:40:09,124 --> 00:40:10,390
Let's go.

548
00:40:21,436 --> 00:40:24,756
Do you want anything? You
know, like a sandwich or a...

549
00:40:24,805 --> 00:40:26,239
I don't know, a blanket?

550
00:40:26,307 --> 00:40:27,618
All right, all right.
I'm good. I'm good.

551
00:40:27,642 --> 00:40:29,208
Sit down, sit down.

552
00:40:34,148 --> 00:40:37,316
I just spent six weeks in
a bed, unable to speak.

553
00:40:38,452 --> 00:40:40,586
When that happens,
you see things.

554
00:40:40,655 --> 00:40:43,175
There's a lot of things that
people don't say to each other

555
00:40:43,224 --> 00:40:44,740
that they should just say.

556
00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:47,243
So I need you to hear
me when I say this.

557
00:40:48,313 --> 00:40:50,846
I know I've needed
you a lot lately.

558
00:40:50,915 --> 00:40:53,383
But I also know, and I
have known for a long time,

559
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:54,451
that Jo loves you.

560
00:40:56,488 --> 00:40:58,755
"Post-it on the wall" loves you.

561
00:41:01,142 --> 00:41:03,126
Don't ignore that.

562
00:41:03,194 --> 00:41:04,894
You can have more
than one person.

563
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:07,146
I used to think you
couldn't, but now I know.

564
00:41:07,215 --> 00:41:09,282
I mean, turns out I have
a whole damn village.

565
00:41:10,501 --> 00:41:12,752
So, you don't have
to worry about me.

566
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:14,319
Go be with Jo.

567
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:17,289
I'll be fine. I'm okay.

568
00:41:42,233 --> 00:41:44,450
<i>Don't let fear keep you quiet.</i>

569
00:41:44,536 --> 00:41:47,904
"And the moon gave
everything a magical glow

570
00:41:47,972 --> 00:41:51,574
"as if they were dancing
on the Milky Way."

571
00:41:51,643 --> 00:41:52,953
Mommy. Mommy... Yes?

572
00:41:52,977 --> 00:41:54,610
<i>You have a voice.</i>

573
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,212
<i>So use it.</i>

574
00:41:59,851 --> 00:42:01,483
<i>Speak up.</i>

575
00:42:01,552 --> 00:42:03,052
<i>Raise your hands.</i>

576
00:42:03,121 --> 00:42:04,921
<i>Shout your answers.</i>

577
00:42:04,989 --> 00:42:06,856
<i>Make yourself heard.</i>

578
00:42:06,925 --> 00:42:11,360
<i>Whatever it takes,
just find your voice.</i>

579
00:42:11,429 --> 00:42:12,528
<i>And when you do,</i>

580
00:42:16,034 --> 00:42:18,067
<i>fill the damn silence.</i>
