1
00:00:04,271 --> 00:00:05,570
The human brain.

2
00:00:05,623 --> 00:00:07,889
This is the reason
I asked Dr. Grey

3
00:00:07,958 --> 00:00:09,603
if I could fill in for
her this morning.

4
00:00:09,627 --> 00:00:10,971
Nature makes a
beautiful machine.

5
00:00:12,296 --> 00:00:13,579
Don't you think?

6
00:00:13,631 --> 00:00:15,347
<i>You might be surprised,</i>

7
00:00:15,416 --> 00:00:18,199
<i>but anatomy classes can be
uncomfortable for surgeons.</i>

8
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:19,768
Ready to take it apart?

9
00:00:19,837 --> 00:00:21,597
<i>We're trained to put
bodies back together.</i>

10
00:00:21,621 --> 00:00:24,089
<i>We prefer our
tissue warm, alive.</i>

11
00:00:24,158 --> 00:00:27,075
See how easily the
blade slices through?

12
00:00:27,144 --> 00:00:29,210
Comes apart like warm butter.

13
00:00:29,913 --> 00:00:32,047
This big ball of jelly

14
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:34,817
is the essential
element that makes you,

15
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:36,668
you.

16
00:00:36,737 --> 00:00:38,637
Here's a fun fact.

17
00:00:38,706 --> 00:00:42,907
If left to decompose,
the brain actually liquifies.

18
00:00:45,095 --> 00:00:47,323
<i>Usually when a surgeon
is staring at dead tissue...</i>

19
00:00:47,347 --> 00:00:49,208
Look out! Was it
something I said?

20
00:00:51,252 --> 00:00:53,997
<i>It means that something
is very, very wrong.</i>

21
00:00:55,122 --> 00:00:56,555
Oh, God.

22
00:00:56,623 --> 00:00:58,856
Oh, God, please, please.

23
00:00:58,925 --> 00:01:00,058
Please, please, please.

24
00:01:00,127 --> 00:01:02,494
Oh, no, no.

25
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:03,824
No! Whoa.

26
00:01:03,848 --> 00:01:04,996
Hey.

27
00:01:05,066 --> 00:01:06,664
Oh, we had sex?

28
00:01:06,734 --> 00:01:09,334
We had sex. Yeah,
we had so much sex.

29
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:11,415
Yeah, we did. And it was great.

30
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,216
I don't mean to
rush out, but, uh...

31
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,490
There are people in
this house and, um...

32
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:17,487
We had sex and
you're an intern... Yeah.

33
00:01:17,511 --> 00:01:18,760
So you have to get out.

34
00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:21,179
Yeah, okay. Bye.

35
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:23,431
Stop. You... There
might be people out there.

36
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,966
There might be kids.

37
00:01:26,937 --> 00:01:28,087
You have kids?

38
00:01:28,155 --> 00:01:30,422
My sister has kids.
My sister could see you.

39
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:31,690
I mean, I don't hear anyone.

40
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,391
I think we're okay.

41
00:01:33,461 --> 00:01:34,976
Are you sure?

42
00:01:35,045 --> 00:01:37,078
Yeah. We're fine.

43
00:01:39,517 --> 00:01:41,717
Well.

44
00:01:41,785 --> 00:01:42,851
Good morning.

45
00:01:56,066 --> 00:01:57,476
Hey. Good morning.

46
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,628
You said you were drunk.

47
00:01:58,652 --> 00:02:01,052
Can I at least ask if
you used a condom?

48
00:02:01,122 --> 00:02:04,205
Shut up.

49
00:02:04,274 --> 00:02:07,892
Look, there is a jumbo box of
condoms under the bathroom sink.

50
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,694
I share. They are for everyone.

51
00:02:09,763 --> 00:02:11,162
"Jumbo"? Seriously?

52
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:12,647
I was being optimistic.

53
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:13,882
Wait.

54
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:15,195
That was you making
all that noise last night?

55
00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:17,569
I thought that was Amelia.

56
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:20,105
Well, you aren't shy. And
you have a filthy mouth.

57
00:02:20,174 --> 00:02:21,418
Okay, can we
not talk about this?

58
00:02:21,442 --> 00:02:23,308
Please. I am begging you.

59
00:02:23,377 --> 00:02:25,159
So, the intern was good in bed.

60
00:02:25,229 --> 00:02:27,829
Intern? What intern?
Maggie, what intern?

61
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:29,348
Alex can hear us.

62
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:31,143
Alex doesn't care about
this. Do you care, Alex?

63
00:02:31,167 --> 00:02:33,112
Do I care about any of
this conversation? No.

64
00:02:33,136 --> 00:02:34,753
Did he visit lady town?

65
00:02:34,822 --> 00:02:38,573
Because I find if they don't go
down to lady town the first time,

66
00:02:38,642 --> 00:02:39,875
there should be no next time.

67
00:02:39,943 --> 00:02:41,605
She's right about
that. No more talking!

68
00:02:41,629 --> 00:02:42,855
If either of you
says another word,

69
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,580
I will jump out of this
car while it is moving.

70
00:02:45,649 --> 00:02:48,049
And lady town is just
as bad as lady place.

71
00:02:48,118 --> 00:02:49,495
Geez. So sensitive.
Just trying to be nice.

72
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:51,252
Take an interest. God.

73
00:02:51,321 --> 00:02:53,266
Hey, what time do you want
me at your house tonight?

74
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:54,890
Why are you coming
to my house tonight?

75
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:56,937
You're having a dinner party.

76
00:02:56,961 --> 00:02:58,893
Oh, the dinner party.
No, that's not tonight.

77
00:02:58,963 --> 00:03:00,595
No, that's weeks
away. It's on the...

78
00:03:00,664 --> 00:03:02,008
Dinner party's
on the 14th, Alex.

79
00:03:02,032 --> 00:03:03,448
Today is the 14th.

80
00:03:04,985 --> 00:03:06,996
You people need
adult supervision.

81
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,999
I don't think I'm gonna go
to this dinner thing tonight.

82
00:03:09,023 --> 00:03:10,455
I think I'm gonna work.

83
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:11,757
Jo, they don't hate you.

84
00:03:11,825 --> 00:03:13,358
They don't like me.

85
00:03:13,427 --> 00:03:15,894
They're your friends.
They're my bosses.

86
00:03:15,963 --> 00:03:17,507
It's like I'm on
call all the time.

87
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:19,643
They treat me like a resident,

88
00:03:19,667 --> 00:03:21,900
not like a person,
not like your girlfriend.

89
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:23,501
'Cause they only
ever see you here,

90
00:03:23,571 --> 00:03:25,081
'cause you never
go to their parties.

91
00:03:25,105 --> 00:03:26,416
Go to the party. I
want them to know you.

92
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,974
It'll be fun, I promise.

93
00:03:29,043 --> 00:03:31,009
Fun like a barium enema.

94
00:03:33,747 --> 00:03:34,979
What?

95
00:03:35,032 --> 00:03:37,732
Your boyfriend's little
posse controls this place.

96
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:41,136
Jo, you have an
invite to the inner circle.

97
00:03:41,204 --> 00:03:42,649
You go to that party,
you make friends

98
00:03:42,673 --> 00:03:44,317
with the chiefs of neuro,
cardio, and general,

99
00:03:44,341 --> 00:03:45,506
you would be unstoppable.

100
00:03:45,575 --> 00:03:47,353
Every surgery in this
hospital would be yours.

101
00:03:47,377 --> 00:03:49,010
That dinner,

102
00:03:50,547 --> 00:03:51,813
I'd kill for an invite.

103
00:03:51,882 --> 00:03:54,716
You're a little bit
scary right now.

104
00:03:54,785 --> 00:03:56,251
Edwards, my dear.

105
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,053
Let's roll.

106
00:03:58,122 --> 00:04:02,090
Maybe I'll get an invite after
all. First neuro, then the world.

107
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:06,344
He didn't mean it, right?

108
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:09,059
I mean, you don't just toss the
word "divorce" out there like that.

109
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:10,260
It was just the heat
of the moment, right?

110
00:04:10,284 --> 00:04:11,928
Maybe he was just mad, or...

111
00:04:11,952 --> 00:04:13,535
I'm the one who's mad.

112
00:04:13,603 --> 00:04:16,371
Divorce? No. I refuse
to accept it. Refuse.

113
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,883
Do you think he's going
to that thing tonight?

114
00:04:17,907 --> 00:04:19,574
Oh, God. Probably.

115
00:04:19,643 --> 00:04:21,120
Are you going? Please
tell me you're going.

116
00:04:21,144 --> 00:04:22,789
I don't know. I mean,
Callie's gonna be there.

117
00:04:22,813 --> 00:04:24,841
Since when's that been
an issue? It's not. It's just,

118
00:04:24,865 --> 00:04:26,576
I don't want to make her new
girlfriend feel uncomfortable.

119
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,200
You know, intimidated by me. I
mean, if she's even bringing her.

120
00:04:29,236 --> 00:04:30,697
I don't know if she's
bringing her. Do you?

121
00:04:30,721 --> 00:04:32,666
Well, she's right over there.

122
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:33,799
Do you want me to ask her if
she's bringing her girlfriend?

123
00:04:33,823 --> 00:04:35,223
Yes, please.

124
00:04:35,292 --> 00:04:36,936
You ask about Jackson,
I'll ask about Penny.

125
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,126
10-4.

126
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:40,461
Oh, hey, um, about
that thing tonight,

127
00:04:40,531 --> 00:04:42,314
I'm not so sure
any of them cook.

128
00:04:42,366 --> 00:04:44,261
Should I bring food, just in
case, so none of us starve?

129
00:04:44,285 --> 00:04:46,963
You know, I think it's gonna
be fine. Um, do you know if...

130
00:04:46,987 --> 00:04:48,331
Do you know if
Jackson's coming tonight?

131
00:04:48,355 --> 00:04:50,622
Uh, no idea. Are
you bringing Penny?

132
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:53,091
Oh.

133
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,726
I hadn't...

134
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:57,362
Uh, I didn't know if
you'd be okay with that.

135
00:04:57,431 --> 00:04:59,414
And, uh, yeah, I didn't
want it to be awkward

136
00:04:59,483 --> 00:05:01,849
or uncomfortable
for her, you know.

137
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,152
Okay? Me? Mmm-hmm.

138
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:05,653
Oh, I'm fine.

139
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:08,290
Are you kidding?
No, bring her. Totally.

140
00:05:08,358 --> 00:05:11,276
Bring her, 'cause, I
mean, I want to meet her.

141
00:05:11,345 --> 00:05:13,406
I mean, I think that
we all want to meet her.

142
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:15,458
Yeah. I mean, not just me.

143
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:16,932
Mostly me, 'cause I...

144
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,711
I know that I would
really love to meet her.

145
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:20,030
Yeah. I mean...

146
00:05:20,054 --> 00:05:21,069
Mmm-hmm.

147
00:05:21,137 --> 00:05:24,121
I will see if she's available.

148
00:05:24,191 --> 00:05:25,271
Cool, cool.

149
00:05:25,326 --> 00:05:27,036
Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

150
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,461
See? I can do this.

151
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:32,330
I can do this. I'm
excited. It's cool, I'm cool.

152
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:34,432
Yeah, cool people
don't say they're cool.

153
00:05:37,487 --> 00:05:38,954
Rachel Bishop, 32,

154
00:05:39,022 --> 00:05:41,590
post-op day one following
decompressive craniotomy.

155
00:05:41,658 --> 00:05:42,902
Isn't able to respond verbally,

156
00:05:42,926 --> 00:05:45,038
but is arousable and
following motor commands.

157
00:05:45,062 --> 00:05:46,294
Excellent.

158
00:05:46,362 --> 00:05:48,629
She is the perfect candidate
for early ambulation.

159
00:05:48,698 --> 00:05:50,349
You want to get her on her feet?

160
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:51,577
She just had surgery yesterday.

161
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:52,934
That's exactly the point.

162
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,220
New studies are showing

163
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:57,033
that if we get neuro
patients up and moving

164
00:05:57,057 --> 00:05:59,736
as soon as possible after
surgery, they recover faster.

165
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,953
They have a greater
return to function.

166
00:06:00,977 --> 00:06:02,394
But the protocol is that we...

167
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:04,896
That is the great thing about
being head of the department.

168
00:06:04,965 --> 00:06:07,499
I decide what is
and is not protocol.

169
00:06:08,218 --> 00:06:09,434
Yes, ma'am.

170
00:06:09,486 --> 00:06:10,486
Mmm-hmm.

171
00:06:11,088 --> 00:06:12,820
Uh...

172
00:06:12,889 --> 00:06:16,591
Call Rachel's mother and
suggest she not come in today.

173
00:06:16,659 --> 00:06:18,219
It is gonna be a little rough.

174
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:23,981
Uh, Dr. Shepherd, sorry,

175
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,079
but Dr. Hunt said to round
up all available interns.

176
00:06:26,103 --> 00:06:27,718
Why? What's going on?

177
00:06:27,787 --> 00:06:29,449
We're about to get
hit with a silver flood.

178
00:06:29,473 --> 00:06:32,474
I need fiber-optic intubation
on standby for each bed.

179
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,844
What do we got? Silver flood.

180
00:06:35,912 --> 00:06:40,181
Okay, I need vitamin K, warm
fluids, blankets, and Bair Huggers.

181
00:06:40,249 --> 00:06:41,816
Uh, what's a silver flood?

182
00:06:41,885 --> 00:06:43,313
A silver flood is
a fracture feast.

183
00:06:43,337 --> 00:06:45,169
I need slings, splints,
and pelvic binders,

184
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:46,282
as many as you can
get your hands on.

185
00:06:46,306 --> 00:06:47,383
Silver flood? Silver flood.

186
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,073
Oh, and page every
on-call X-ray tech.

187
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:51,153
Haven't seen one of
these since Mercy West.

188
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:52,711
This will be fun.

189
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:54,429
Yes, but what is it exactly?

190
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:56,125
A silver flood is no
regular day in the pit.

191
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:58,967
Patients might be agitated,
angry, possibly even violent.

192
00:06:59,036 --> 00:07:01,502
Use soothing tones, but
do not speak too softly.

193
00:07:01,571 --> 00:07:03,822
Do not administer
unnecessary fluids.

194
00:07:03,891 --> 00:07:06,941
If you see bruising, think
bleeding. No narcotics, no benzos.

195
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,142
Any questions?

196
00:07:08,211 --> 00:07:10,006
Yes, what is a silver flood?

197
00:07:15,318 --> 00:07:17,380
I spent good money
on that damn cruise,

198
00:07:17,404 --> 00:07:20,305
and the shuttle bus crashed
before we even reached the port.

199
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:24,208
Damn driver was fiddling with
his phone the entire damn way.

200
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,177
So, he was texting?

201
00:07:26,246 --> 00:07:28,112
Not on your life.

202
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:31,650
The way he was staring at
that thing, it had to be porno.

203
00:07:31,718 --> 00:07:33,346
All right, call the OR.

204
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:35,014
Tell them they need to have
it ready for me yesterday.

205
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:36,215
Go!

206
00:07:36,239 --> 00:07:39,007
Oh, silver flood.

207
00:07:39,075 --> 00:07:40,420
Well, what did you think it was?

208
00:07:40,444 --> 00:07:42,188
Why do you need a code
word for a bunch of old people?

209
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:44,112
What? We're not old people.

210
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:45,797
We're senior citizens.

211
00:07:45,866 --> 00:07:47,610
Disrespectful.
Calling people old.

212
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:49,378
Who do you think you are?
- I'm not old.

213
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:51,219
- You don't know old.
- You are rude.

214
00:07:51,288 --> 00:07:53,421
That's why. Have fun with that.

215
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:55,540
I want to speak
to your supervisor.

216
00:08:10,507 --> 00:08:15,026
Thiazide for the blood pressure,
metformin for my diabetes.

217
00:08:15,094 --> 00:08:17,595
I also take another
pill for my arthritis.

218
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:19,180
Great, so... I'm not done.

219
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:21,682
Also some kind
of cholesterol pill

220
00:08:21,752 --> 00:08:24,018
and a baby aspirin.

221
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:25,127
That's it.

222
00:08:27,574 --> 00:08:31,309
Eddie, are you sure
you're not forgetting

223
00:08:31,378 --> 00:08:33,089
some of the medications
you might've been on,

224
00:08:33,113 --> 00:08:36,097
like, say for, I don't know,

225
00:08:36,183 --> 00:08:37,348
erectile dysfunction?

226
00:08:37,417 --> 00:08:39,150
Do I look like the kind of guy

227
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:41,952
who needs to pop a
pill to pop a woody?

228
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:43,766
Well, you know,
I'm just gonna ask.

229
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:44,990
'Cause if you were

230
00:08:45,058 --> 00:08:46,819
on one of those meds
and you didn't tell us,

231
00:08:46,843 --> 00:08:49,004
then that could have
a very bad reaction

232
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:50,873
based on any medications
we might give you.

233
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:52,408
You could have a
drop in blood pressure,

234
00:08:52,432 --> 00:08:54,749
you could have a stroke,
you could have a heart attack.

235
00:08:54,818 --> 00:08:56,434
You need proof?

236
00:08:56,502 --> 00:08:57,903
Watch this.

237
00:08:57,955 --> 00:08:59,620
No! No, no, no! That's okay.

238
00:08:59,689 --> 00:09:00,967
That's... Please don't do that.

239
00:09:00,991 --> 00:09:03,591
Mrs. Margraff, we are
going to take you up to CT

240
00:09:03,659 --> 00:09:04,820
and have you checked out, okay?

241
00:09:04,844 --> 00:09:06,510
I'm not a missus, dear.

242
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,796
The gentleman and I
are just shacking up.

243
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:10,360
Oh.

244
00:09:10,384 --> 00:09:12,116
How's my girl?

245
00:09:12,185 --> 00:09:13,785
I'm fine, Abe.

246
00:09:13,837 --> 00:09:15,369
Settle down.

247
00:09:15,438 --> 00:09:17,288
Check his left hip.

248
00:09:17,357 --> 00:09:21,659
He took a spill in February,
hasn't been the same since.

249
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:26,147
Hasn't slowed him down, though.

250
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:28,499
Wait, look. Don't
bother with me.

251
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:31,269
Just make sure
Gabby's all right.

252
00:09:31,338 --> 00:09:33,738
These girls know
what they're doing.

253
00:09:33,806 --> 00:09:36,490
I'm just banged up is all.

254
00:09:36,577 --> 00:09:40,011
Okay, so tell the
nurses to monitor him

255
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,346
and keep him hydrated.

256
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,343
Abe, we are going to take Gabby

257
00:09:44,367 --> 00:09:46,212
up and get her
checked out, okay?

258
00:09:46,236 --> 00:09:49,871
Okay. I'll be right
here, Gabs, okay?

259
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:52,073
Will you bring her back here?

260
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:53,158
Absolutely.

261
00:09:53,226 --> 00:09:55,310
Take a nap, you old bastard!

262
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:58,907
Rachel, we just need to get
you to the edge of the bed.

263
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:00,365
We get there, we can stop,

264
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,767
and I know it hurts, but you
got to keep your eyes open.

265
00:10:02,835 --> 00:10:05,035
Brody, hold her lines
steady. Watch her IV.

266
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:07,338
Come on. Just a little further.

267
00:10:12,595 --> 00:10:14,374
Maybe we should stop? Not yet.

268
00:10:14,398 --> 00:10:16,191
We don't stop until we get
her to the edge of the bed

269
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:17,694
or reach her point
of intolerance.

270
00:10:17,718 --> 00:10:19,700
"Point of intolerance"?
How will we know?

271
00:10:22,522 --> 00:10:25,323
Uh, I think that's pretty clear.

272
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:27,136
Okay. We're gonna
let you relax now.

273
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,510
You did very, very well.

274
00:10:29,579 --> 00:10:30,945
Let's get her cleaned up.

275
00:10:31,031 --> 00:10:32,364
Stop.

276
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:34,549
I got it.

277
00:10:46,829 --> 00:10:48,207
I'm gonna need
you to take the lead

278
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:49,575
on Rachel Bishop's next session.

279
00:10:49,599 --> 00:10:50,831
Me?

280
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,844
Yeah, I have a full board,
there's a silver flood,

281
00:10:52,868 --> 00:10:54,402
and if we miss a session,

282
00:10:54,471 --> 00:10:56,137
we have to stop the treatment.

283
00:10:56,206 --> 00:10:58,646
Well, would that
really be so bad?

284
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:02,305
Do you have something
you need to say?

285
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:04,094
I...

286
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:06,998
I don't think I'm comfortable
with this course of treatment.

287
00:11:07,067 --> 00:11:08,349
I see.

288
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:10,802
We are obviously
pushing her way past

289
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,281
what she can handle
right now, and I just feel...

290
00:11:12,305 --> 00:11:13,855
Edwards.

291
00:11:13,924 --> 00:11:16,458
This protocol is
extremely difficult.

292
00:11:16,526 --> 00:11:18,192
It feels traumatic.

293
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:19,739
But you have to
look at it like surgery.

294
00:11:19,763 --> 00:11:21,463
Surgery is traumatic.

295
00:11:21,531 --> 00:11:24,833
It is so, so hard
on the human body.

296
00:11:24,901 --> 00:11:28,369
But in most cases, it is a
patient's best chance to live,

297
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:31,372
to be normal again, to heal.

298
00:11:33,042 --> 00:11:35,482
This is Rachel's chance to heal.

299
00:11:36,379 --> 00:11:38,012
While she vomits.

300
00:11:40,734 --> 00:11:42,132
Find me when you're done.

301
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:43,912
<i>Portable X-ray tech to ER.</i>

302
00:11:43,936 --> 00:11:46,053
<i>Portable X-ray tech to ER.</i>

303
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:51,693
Excuse me, sweetheart.

304
00:11:51,761 --> 00:11:54,161
Oh, it's Dr. Sweetheart.
But what can I do for you?

305
00:11:54,197 --> 00:11:56,680
Well, my lady friend,
Gabby Margraff,

306
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:59,550
they said they were
taking her for a PT.

307
00:11:59,619 --> 00:12:02,069
Or something or a PP?

308
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:04,021
A CT? That's the ticket.

309
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:07,592
Oh, boy. You know, I
haven't seen her since, but I...

310
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:10,027
And I don't want to be a bother,

311
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:11,879
but nobody's said anything.

312
00:12:11,948 --> 00:12:15,333
Okay, well, hold
on. Let me see. Um...

313
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:18,498
Oh, yeah. Okay, so according
to this, she's still in CT.

314
00:12:18,522 --> 00:12:19,687
Okay.

315
00:12:19,756 --> 00:12:21,873
Oh, okay, good, good.

316
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:23,941
Great. Is there anything
else I can do for you?

317
00:12:25,261 --> 00:12:27,294
You got Jell-O here, right?

318
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:30,097
We do. Indeed.

319
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:33,284
Diaphragmatic contour
is abnormal on the left.

320
00:12:33,352 --> 00:12:34,552
It could be a rupture.

321
00:12:34,621 --> 00:12:36,287
Any abdominal strain

322
00:12:36,355 --> 00:12:38,939
and she could pop her
guts right into her left lung.

323
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:41,403
I think there might be a
splenic hematoma also,

324
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:42,989
but I won't know
until I get in there.

325
00:12:43,013 --> 00:12:45,563
Any way you can
do it without a scar?

326
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:50,681
We'll do the best we can,
Gabby, okay? You just sit tight.

327
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:56,090
Are you okay? Yeah.

328
00:12:56,176 --> 00:12:57,592
What's the matter?

329
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,710
Um, no, I'm having flashbacks.

330
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:03,280
Sex flashbacks.

331
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:07,601
Oh, oh. Hey, Wilson, would
you step outside, please?

332
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:13,258
Okay, you were
saying about the sex?

333
00:13:13,326 --> 00:13:15,660
Meredith. There was so much sex.

334
00:13:16,696 --> 00:13:18,763
Hot, hot sex.

335
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:20,365
Everything hurts.

336
00:13:20,433 --> 00:13:23,268
My back, my hip,
the top of my head.

337
00:13:23,336 --> 00:13:24,785
I feel like I'm 80.

338
00:13:24,854 --> 00:13:27,288
Oh, my God. He's an intern.

339
00:13:27,874 --> 00:13:29,273
Who does that?

340
00:13:29,342 --> 00:13:32,010
Who screws the interns?
What kind of person does that?

341
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:34,512
The father of my children.

342
00:13:35,549 --> 00:13:37,315
Oh, Meredith.

343
00:13:37,384 --> 00:13:39,662
Okay, I didn't mean, you know
I didn't mean... I'm very sorry.

344
00:13:39,686 --> 00:13:41,285
It's fine. Just relax.

345
00:13:41,354 --> 00:13:44,022
You think you're the first person
to have inappropriate work sex?

346
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:46,524
We all do it all
over the hospital.

347
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:48,576
I mean, we even
did it in here once.

348
00:13:51,447 --> 00:13:53,247
You know, I haven't
thought about it.

349
00:13:53,316 --> 00:13:54,582
Sex.

350
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:59,386
I haven't thought
about it at all since

351
00:13:59,455 --> 00:14:01,155
that last morning,

352
00:14:01,224 --> 00:14:03,625
the morning of the day he died.

353
00:14:03,693 --> 00:14:06,911
Mags, I'm a widow.

354
00:14:06,963 --> 00:14:08,729
Meredith, I'm so sorry.

355
00:14:08,798 --> 00:14:11,131
We don't have to
talk about this. Um...

356
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,412
I can't believe I even
opened my stupid mouth.

357
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:15,130
Do you want me to
get Alex or something?

358
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:17,388
I'm so sorry. No, no. It's...

359
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:19,490
I'm a widow.

360
00:14:19,558 --> 00:14:21,259
I mean, like in the
books and the movies.

361
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:23,995
You don't think that
that happens, but it does.

362
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:26,130
It's just... I'm
closed for business.

363
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:29,100
Vagina city's a ghost town.

364
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:32,003
Orgasm train doesn't
roll through here anymore.

365
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,356
That part of my life is over.

366
00:14:35,424 --> 00:14:37,937
You know, eventually,
you'll... When you're ready...

367
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:39,727
No. I don't want to.

368
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:41,262
It's fine.

369
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:43,998
I'm okay. I'm good.

370
00:14:44,067 --> 00:14:46,734
So, tell me about the hot,
hot sex with the hot intern

371
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:47,969
and how he did you sideways

372
00:14:48,038 --> 00:14:50,972
because I am widow
Grey, dead inside.

373
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:53,824
Honey, no.

374
00:14:53,876 --> 00:14:56,743
That is the saddest
story I've ever heard.

375
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:57,878
Gabby.

376
00:14:57,947 --> 00:15:00,098
<i>Honey, you're breaking my heart.</i>

377
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:03,717
The orgasm train should
never stop running.

378
00:15:03,803 --> 00:15:08,122
I've had an orgasm
every day since I was 15.

379
00:15:08,191 --> 00:15:11,759
Well, when I was 15, I was
scrapbooking with my mom.

380
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:13,556
We had nine different
kinds of glitter.

381
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,213
Now, see, that is hot to me.

382
00:15:15,282 --> 00:15:17,381
Orgasms are wonderful.

383
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:20,167
I had two this morning
before we got on the bus.

384
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:24,549
How long has he been
down? Ten minutes.

385
00:15:24,573 --> 00:15:26,502
I ran through the ACLS
v-fib protocol twice.

386
00:15:26,526 --> 00:15:28,325
Okay, charge to 200.

387
00:15:28,378 --> 00:15:29,643
What happened?

388
00:15:29,712 --> 00:15:31,390
He was having chest pains,
so I gave him some nitro.

389
00:15:31,414 --> 00:15:32,909
His BP bottomed out all at once.

390
00:15:32,933 --> 00:15:34,793
I'm worried he was on
ED meds. We asked him.

391
00:15:34,817 --> 00:15:36,134
Well, was he? Clear!

392
00:15:36,186 --> 00:15:37,596
What happened?
He insisted he wasn't.

393
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,097
We asked him several times.
We told him what could happen.

394
00:15:39,121 --> 00:15:40,766
Clear! He probably lied.

395
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:42,790
Why would he do
that when we told him?

396
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:45,571
People can be stubborn, even
when it's the worst thing for them.

397
00:15:45,595 --> 00:15:48,328
We told him. Time
of death, 12:19.

398
00:15:48,397 --> 00:15:50,197
What do...

399
00:15:51,067 --> 00:15:52,567
What do we do now?

400
00:15:52,635 --> 00:15:54,635
You notify the morgue.

401
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:56,504
That's it? That's it.

402
00:16:01,194 --> 00:16:03,510
Excuse me. Can you help me?

403
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:05,658
They said my father
was in the accident.

404
00:16:05,682 --> 00:16:07,492
Can you tell me
where I can find him?

405
00:16:07,516 --> 00:16:08,849
What's his name?

406
00:16:08,918 --> 00:16:11,702
Edward Squire. Eddie.
He only answers to Eddie.

407
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:16,341
Uh... Okay.

408
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:20,078
I should, uh, you
know, I'm gonna...

409
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:21,390
Let's find someone
who can talk to you.

410
00:16:21,414 --> 00:16:22,963
What? Why?

411
00:16:23,032 --> 00:16:24,832
Is he hurt?

412
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:29,437
He, um... I'm really sorry,
but I don't think I should be...

413
00:16:29,505 --> 00:16:30,921
Just tell me.

414
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:34,325
He had a heart attack.

415
00:16:34,394 --> 00:16:35,593
Oh.

416
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:38,112
Is he all right? Can
you take me to him?

417
00:16:38,181 --> 00:16:39,480
No, I can't. I can't.

418
00:16:39,549 --> 00:16:42,516
What do you mean you
can't? Just tell me where he is.

419
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:44,518
Your father's... He...

420
00:16:45,688 --> 00:16:47,121
He passed away.

421
00:16:49,142 --> 00:16:50,524
What?

422
00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:52,003
We think he lied about the
medication he was taking.

423
00:16:52,027 --> 00:16:54,194
What are you talking
about? He's dead?

424
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:56,074
My father is dead? No,
please just come with me.

425
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:57,393
And we can find
someone who can...

426
00:16:57,417 --> 00:16:58,582
Don't you touch me!

427
00:16:58,635 --> 00:17:00,079
Whoa, whoa.

428
00:17:00,103 --> 00:17:01,652
Sir, sir.

429
00:17:01,721 --> 00:17:04,200
He said my father was dead,
and he won't tell me where he is!

430
00:17:04,224 --> 00:17:06,418
I am so sorry. He
said my dad was a liar.

431
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:07,791
Sir, come sit down.

432
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:08,870
I will tell you everything
that happened

433
00:17:08,894 --> 00:17:10,456
and I will take you
to your dad, okay?

434
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,946
Okay. Please, please.

435
00:17:12,014 --> 00:17:14,665
Get him a chair and bring
him some water. Right.

436
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:17,663
Thank you. That was...

437
00:17:17,687 --> 00:17:19,419
What did you do?
What did you say to him?

438
00:17:19,489 --> 00:17:21,809
Dr. Hunt, I... What
the hell did you say?

439
00:17:26,478 --> 00:17:30,147
I thought the point of a singles
cruise was to meet other singles.

440
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:31,515
Exactly.

441
00:17:31,584 --> 00:17:33,161
Where do you think I met Gabby?

442
00:17:33,185 --> 00:17:35,553
Five years ago
almost to the day.

443
00:17:35,622 --> 00:17:37,221
Really? Mmm.

444
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:39,006
Absotively.

445
00:17:39,075 --> 00:17:40,608
I didn't even want to go.

446
00:17:40,676 --> 00:17:43,176
But my sister wouldn't
get off my back.

447
00:17:43,245 --> 00:17:44,745
"Go out, meet people.

448
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:47,126
"Don't just sit at
home in that chair."

449
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:48,749
It's a nice chair?

450
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:50,083
The best.

451
00:17:50,153 --> 00:17:54,522
Oh, you press a button
and your feet go up.

452
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:57,024
And there's a... And
there's a warmer in the seat.

453
00:17:57,092 --> 00:17:59,894
And a little cubby
for the remote.

454
00:17:59,963 --> 00:18:02,396
Sounds like a dream.

455
00:18:02,465 --> 00:18:04,765
Now I'm living a new dream.

456
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:07,045
I got the chair. I got the girl.

457
00:18:07,069 --> 00:18:09,348
Here, but let me
show you something.

458
00:18:09,372 --> 00:18:11,605
Oh, Abe, this is all too sudden.

459
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:13,541
I barely know
you. I just met you.

460
00:18:13,609 --> 00:18:16,894
You know, you're a
wise ass. But I like that.

461
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:20,865
Mmm.

462
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:22,416
It's beautiful.

463
00:18:22,485 --> 00:18:24,818
Gabby's beautiful.

464
00:18:24,888 --> 00:18:26,715
I was gonna propose on the boat.

465
00:18:26,739 --> 00:18:28,172
On the third night,

466
00:18:28,241 --> 00:18:31,375
there's this big dance
in the main dining room.

467
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:35,129
Huge ice sculptures and a
dance band and everything.

468
00:18:35,198 --> 00:18:37,398
That's where I first saw her.

469
00:18:38,133 --> 00:18:39,133
Whoa.

470
00:18:40,002 --> 00:18:42,035
The dress she was wearing.

471
00:18:44,207 --> 00:18:48,041
I got so dizzy, I
just had to sit down.

472
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:50,694
I closed my eyes for a second,
and when I opened them...

473
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,930
Oh, gosh dang it.

474
00:18:53,999 --> 00:18:55,867
Abe, I'm so sorry. Duty calls.

475
00:18:55,935 --> 00:18:57,735
Oh, you kidding? Go.

476
00:18:57,804 --> 00:18:59,765
You got more important things
to do than to listen to my stories.

477
00:18:59,789 --> 00:19:01,388
I am getting the
rest of that story.

478
00:19:01,457 --> 00:19:03,073
I will be back ASAP.

479
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,386
Bring another Jell-O with you.

480
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:06,811
Oh, okay. Wait, hold
on. Raspberry or lime?

481
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,412
Surprise me.

482
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:10,381
Okay.

483
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:13,094
Okay, Gabby, we're going
to put you under now, okay?

484
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:15,386
I need to tell Abe.
Abe is downstairs.

485
00:19:15,438 --> 00:19:16,865
We're gonna tell him
everything that's going on.

486
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:18,356
No, I need to tell him.

487
00:19:18,424 --> 00:19:21,025
He'll crap his pants if
he thinks I'm in trouble.

488
00:19:21,093 --> 00:19:22,777
I can grab an intern to...

489
00:19:22,862 --> 00:19:26,096
Bless his heart, he may
actually crap his pants.

490
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,165
He's 90.

491
00:19:28,451 --> 00:19:30,112
Okay, the sats are down to 87.

492
00:19:30,136 --> 00:19:32,419
Gabby, I'm gonna need you
to take some deep breaths.

493
00:19:32,488 --> 00:19:34,032
Let's get her under right now.

494
00:19:34,056 --> 00:19:35,901
Wilson, go down and
find someone to tell Abe

495
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:38,442
that Gabby's in surgery
and she is just fine.

496
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:40,294
I was gonna scrub in.

497
00:19:40,363 --> 00:19:43,683
Wilson, we have enough
hands here. Go cover the pit.

498
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:46,078
You'll see him when you wake up.

499
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:48,080
Listen, Rachel, I
know this is hard,

500
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:50,464
but this is how
you're gonna heal.

501
00:19:50,539 --> 00:19:51,672
Okay?

502
00:19:52,808 --> 00:19:54,174
Here we go.

503
00:19:56,879 --> 00:19:59,413
All right, let's try
for a step, Rachel.

504
00:19:59,482 --> 00:20:00,626
Can you give me a step?

505
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:02,149
One step.

506
00:20:02,217 --> 00:20:05,719
You give me a step, you
get in that chair, we can stop.

507
00:20:05,788 --> 00:20:08,155
Step, the chair, we stop.

508
00:20:08,224 --> 00:20:09,268
It's okay.

509
00:20:09,292 --> 00:20:10,452
Come on. We got you.

510
00:20:10,476 --> 00:20:11,503
You can do it. It's okay.

511
00:20:11,527 --> 00:20:12,767
Come on. Step, chair, stop.

512
00:20:12,829 --> 00:20:14,445
It's okay.

513
00:20:14,497 --> 00:20:15,497
I got you.

514
00:20:15,564 --> 00:20:16,764
Step, chair, stop.

515
00:20:22,121 --> 00:20:23,832
That's enough.
That's enough for now.

516
00:20:23,856 --> 00:20:25,973
Put her down. Dr. Edwards?

517
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:27,653
That's okay. That's
good, Rachel.

518
00:20:27,677 --> 00:20:29,242
That's really good.

519
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,156
Let's get you back to
bed. Let's get her in bed.

520
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:33,029
We haven't reached
her point of intolerance.

521
00:20:33,098 --> 00:20:34,843
Dr. Shepherd... I
said we're done.

522
00:20:34,867 --> 00:20:35,983
Okay.

523
00:20:37,303 --> 00:20:38,752
Legs.

524
00:20:38,821 --> 00:20:40,954
You did so good.

525
00:20:41,024 --> 00:20:43,457
You did really good.

526
00:20:43,526 --> 00:20:45,359
Really good, okay?

527
00:20:47,563 --> 00:20:49,113
Want to go grab
some food with me?

528
00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:50,614
I have no appetite.

529
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:53,679
Shepherd's making me torture a
patient who just had brain surgery.

530
00:20:53,703 --> 00:20:55,269
Because she likes you.

531
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:57,016
She got a funny
way of showing it.

532
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,134
At least she lets
you torture a patient.

533
00:20:59,158 --> 00:21:01,425
Grey and Pierce just
threw me out of the OR.

534
00:21:01,494 --> 00:21:02,571
They hate me.

535
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:04,628
You know, I need
to be more like you.

536
00:21:04,697 --> 00:21:07,881
You make the system your bitch.

537
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:09,850
If I could get an
attending to look at me

538
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:11,769
the way that
Shepherd looks at you...

539
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:16,807
Okay, Rachel, Dr. Edwards said

540
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:18,554
that we just need to
get you into this chair,

541
00:21:18,578 --> 00:21:20,127
so that's what we're gonna do.

542
00:21:20,196 --> 00:21:21,428
All right.

543
00:21:21,497 --> 00:21:23,130
Okay. Ready?

544
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,799
Wilson?

545
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:27,868
A word, please?

546
00:21:27,937 --> 00:21:28,969
I'll be back.

547
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:30,170
Dr. Shepherd,

548
00:21:30,239 --> 00:21:32,234
I was just about to
get Rachel on her feet.

549
00:21:32,258 --> 00:21:33,674
Where the hell is Edwards?

550
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:37,194
There were 40
passengers on the bus.

551
00:21:37,263 --> 00:21:38,606
Eight of them died en route.

552
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,693
We've lost six in
the ER already,

553
00:21:40,717 --> 00:21:43,184
and many more are in surgery

554
00:21:43,252 --> 00:21:45,702
or in critical care in the ICU.

555
00:21:45,755 --> 00:21:47,199
All of these peoples' families

556
00:21:47,223 --> 00:21:50,257
are on their way to
this hospital right now.

557
00:21:50,325 --> 00:21:51,859
When they get here,

558
00:21:51,927 --> 00:21:54,995
you will be responsible
for informing them

559
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:56,208
that their loved ones have died.

560
00:21:56,232 --> 00:21:57,375
What?

561
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:58,460
Why us?

562
00:21:58,484 --> 00:22:00,767
Because after what
I've seen today,

563
00:22:00,853 --> 00:22:02,431
you clearly need to practice.

564
00:22:02,455 --> 00:22:05,689
Now, there are
four steps to this.

565
00:22:05,758 --> 00:22:09,960
Location, language,
body language, and leave.

566
00:22:10,028 --> 00:22:12,896
We think of them
as the four L's.

567
00:22:12,965 --> 00:22:15,599
The first "L," location.

568
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:18,034
Bring them to a quiet,
comfortable place

569
00:22:18,103 --> 00:22:19,264
where they won't be disturbed.

570
00:22:19,288 --> 00:22:22,039
Looking for the family
of Nestor Rodriguez.

571
00:22:22,107 --> 00:22:23,390
Family of Emma Pritchett?

572
00:22:23,459 --> 00:22:24,742
June Napali?

573
00:22:24,794 --> 00:22:26,109
That's me.

574
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:28,278
Ah, sir, can you
come with me, please?

575
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:29,814
Just a minute.

576
00:22:30,833 --> 00:22:32,032
Okay, here, let me...

577
00:22:32,101 --> 00:22:34,835
Get your damn hands
off me. I can do it.

578
00:22:34,904 --> 00:22:36,086
Next, language.

579
00:22:36,139 --> 00:22:38,005
We used all our capabilities.

580
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:39,272
Don't sugarcoat it.

581
00:22:39,341 --> 00:22:41,453
Don't leave anything
open to interpretation.

582
00:22:41,477 --> 00:22:43,910
Unfortunately, we were
unable to resuscitate him.

583
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:45,424
And despite our best efforts...

584
00:22:45,448 --> 00:22:47,414
You have to use the word "died."

585
00:22:47,483 --> 00:22:50,284
Franklin is no longer with us.

586
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:52,519
Grandpa left? Where'd he go?

587
00:22:52,605 --> 00:22:54,671
What? Can we go there?

588
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,790
Oh, I'm sorry.

589
00:22:56,859 --> 00:22:58,075
That's not what I...

590
00:22:58,144 --> 00:23:00,944
Are you going to take
us there now? Uh...

591
00:23:01,496 --> 00:23:02,896
<i>Third, body language.</i>

592
00:23:02,965 --> 00:23:05,148
<i>Often a comforting
touch can help.</i>

593
00:23:05,218 --> 00:23:07,634
<i>A hand on the arm
or on the shoulder,</i>

594
00:23:09,205 --> 00:23:11,122
<i>if it feels appropriate.</i>

595
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:13,390
Grandpa's in
heaven now, sweetie,

596
00:23:13,459 --> 00:23:15,619
with your turtle.

597
00:23:16,745 --> 00:23:19,046
Why are you still here?

598
00:23:19,115 --> 00:23:21,331
<i>And finally, leave as
soon as you're able.</i>

599
00:23:21,401 --> 00:23:23,244
<i>You've done what you came
to do, so excuse yourself.</i>

600
00:23:23,268 --> 00:23:24,385
<i>Get out.</i>

601
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:26,002
You know what?

602
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:28,639
We're just gonna do this here.

603
00:23:35,314 --> 00:23:36,580
Hi. Hey.

604
00:23:36,649 --> 00:23:38,148
Hey, hey.

605
00:23:39,218 --> 00:23:40,484
Abraham.

606
00:23:51,898 --> 00:23:53,497
Hey, who was
monitoring this man?

607
00:23:53,565 --> 00:23:55,527
I checked him five minutes ago.

608
00:23:55,551 --> 00:23:57,117
He was fine.

609
00:23:57,186 --> 00:23:58,419
Oh, Abe.

610
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:10,997
I cannot fathom
what possessed you

611
00:24:11,066 --> 00:24:13,684
to abandon your... My patient.

612
00:24:13,752 --> 00:24:15,330
Dr. Shepherd...
Why are you talking?

613
00:24:15,354 --> 00:24:16,987
No one is talking to you.

614
00:24:17,055 --> 00:24:18,372
You, speak.

615
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:21,892
I did not abandon her.
Dr. Wilson is an excellent...

616
00:24:21,961 --> 00:24:24,311
I didn't choose
Wil, I chose you.

617
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:26,914
I gave you specific
instructions.

618
00:24:26,982 --> 00:24:28,148
I couldn't do it.

619
00:24:28,217 --> 00:24:30,028
I'm sorry. I couldn't
put Rachel through that.

620
00:24:30,052 --> 00:24:31,129
Okay, okay.

621
00:24:31,153 --> 00:24:33,353
Okay, okay, okay.

622
00:24:35,057 --> 00:24:36,690
Edwards, why?

623
00:24:36,759 --> 00:24:39,209
There has to be a
good reason why,

624
00:24:39,278 --> 00:24:41,912
because you are
too smart for this.

625
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:43,630
So, tell me.

626
00:24:46,635 --> 00:24:47,834
Look...

627
00:24:49,705 --> 00:24:51,205
When I was a kid,

628
00:24:51,273 --> 00:24:54,074
I was in a clinical trial
for sickle cell anemia.

629
00:24:54,143 --> 00:24:56,259
What? I was five.

630
00:24:56,329 --> 00:24:59,896
They held me down, the
nurses and the doctors,

631
00:24:59,949 --> 00:25:03,333
sticking me with needles
and taking my bone marrow.

632
00:25:03,402 --> 00:25:06,086
You can't imagine the pain.

633
00:25:06,155 --> 00:25:08,955
And my mom would
be saying over and over,

634
00:25:09,024 --> 00:25:12,292
"Honey, it's for your own
good. It's for your own good."

635
00:25:12,361 --> 00:25:15,862
I screamed and I
kicked and I fought,

636
00:25:15,932 --> 00:25:19,583
and so sometimes they
would strap me to the table,

637
00:25:19,652 --> 00:25:21,919
which they were right to do.

638
00:25:21,987 --> 00:25:23,570
For my own good.

639
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:26,172
I was five.

640
00:25:26,241 --> 00:25:30,594
I felt like I was being punished
for something that I didn't do,

641
00:25:30,663 --> 00:25:33,029
for something that
was inside of me.

642
00:25:33,098 --> 00:25:35,816
And I'm not gonna do
that to somebody else.

643
00:25:37,052 --> 00:25:38,435
I'm sorry.

644
00:25:38,504 --> 00:25:40,020
I can't. I won't.

645
00:25:42,992 --> 00:25:46,142
Hey, Hunt, um, I need to
find a patient, Gabby Margraff.

646
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:48,639
Oh, she's in surgery with Grey
and Pierce. What do you need?

647
00:25:48,663 --> 00:25:51,598
I need to tell her her boyfriend's
dead. He coded in the hallway.

648
00:25:51,667 --> 00:25:54,785
Well, how did he...
I mean, he's 90.

649
00:25:54,854 --> 00:25:58,455
Could've been a stroke or
an MI. He just fell asleep and...

650
00:25:58,524 --> 00:26:00,624
Robbins, I'm sorry.

651
00:26:00,676 --> 00:26:02,409
We'll take care of it, okay?

652
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:03,510
Mmm.

653
00:26:03,579 --> 00:26:05,419
Okay. Thanks.

654
00:26:43,319 --> 00:26:44,751
Oh, God.

655
00:26:45,921 --> 00:26:47,470
What happened?

656
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:48,605
Nothing.

657
00:26:48,674 --> 00:26:50,740
Nothing. I'm fine.

658
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:52,509
What happened?

659
00:26:52,578 --> 00:26:55,056
I don't know. I don't
even know why I'm crying.

660
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:58,482
He wasn't even my patient.

661
00:26:58,551 --> 00:27:02,002
He wasn't even a
baby. He was 90.

662
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:03,270
Who was 90?

663
00:27:03,339 --> 00:27:04,788
Abe.

664
00:27:04,857 --> 00:27:06,097
He was...

665
00:27:07,193 --> 00:27:09,058
in love.

666
00:27:09,128 --> 00:27:11,545
He met the love of his life

667
00:27:11,613 --> 00:27:13,880
when he was 85,

668
00:27:13,949 --> 00:27:16,583
and he was gonna propose to her.

669
00:27:16,652 --> 00:27:17,751
But he died.

670
00:27:18,304 --> 00:27:21,054
Oh. I'm sorry.

671
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:23,841
God, I felt like I could
talk to him forever.

672
00:27:23,909 --> 00:27:27,711
He made me feel like...

673
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:31,381
You know, I never really
believed that I'd find love again.

674
00:27:32,217 --> 00:27:35,285
Not anything real or true.

675
00:27:35,354 --> 00:27:37,714
I thought that I had
it and I screwed it up,

676
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:40,040
and that was over.

677
00:27:40,109 --> 00:27:43,560
Then he was madly in love at 85,

678
00:27:43,628 --> 00:27:47,397
and that is proof that there is,

679
00:27:47,465 --> 00:27:49,811
there is more love out there.

680
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:52,719
Callie might've found
hers and I can find mine,

681
00:27:52,788 --> 00:27:54,872
even if it's in 60 years.

682
00:27:56,909 --> 00:28:00,543
I don't want to find a new
soul mate when I'm 90!

683
00:28:00,612 --> 00:28:04,381
I met mine already
and he wants a divorce.

684
00:28:06,886 --> 00:28:09,219
Oh, sweetie.

685
00:28:10,856 --> 00:28:12,489
This is about me.

686
00:28:13,325 --> 00:28:14,807
This isn't about you.

687
00:28:16,262 --> 00:28:17,294
Sorry.

688
00:28:19,598 --> 00:28:20,997
What the hell was that?

689
00:28:21,066 --> 00:28:22,799
I'm sorry.

690
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:24,646
I didn't mean for you to get
thrown under the bus like that.

691
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:26,503
I don't care about that.

692
00:28:26,572 --> 00:28:28,817
How could you make
up a story like that?

693
00:28:28,841 --> 00:28:30,139
What?

694
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:32,253
Working the system is one thing.

695
00:28:32,277 --> 00:28:34,989
You want to tell a little lie to
get your labs run faster, great.

696
00:28:35,013 --> 00:28:36,480
I'm on board.

697
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:38,815
But that, what you did in there,

698
00:28:38,884 --> 00:28:42,063
the violin you played for
Dr. Shepherd, you can't do that.

699
00:28:42,087 --> 00:28:45,687
You can't manipulate someone
like that. You crossed a line.

700
00:28:45,725 --> 00:28:47,885
Don't you even
have a conscience?

701
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:56,283
Well, it worked, so maybe
I'm better off without one.

702
00:29:05,377 --> 00:29:06,743
Hey.

703
00:29:06,812 --> 00:29:08,879
I owe you an apology.

704
00:29:08,948 --> 00:29:12,966
I... You were helping
out a friend. I overreacted.

705
00:29:13,035 --> 00:29:14,818
Don't worry about it.

706
00:29:16,522 --> 00:29:18,188
If I'd known about Edwards,

707
00:29:18,257 --> 00:29:20,457
I would've approached
the whole thing differently.

708
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:23,677
Um...

709
00:29:23,746 --> 00:29:26,713
We're having this thing
at the house tonight. Um...

710
00:29:27,549 --> 00:29:29,215
You two should come.

711
00:29:29,284 --> 00:29:32,118
There's gonna be food, booze.

712
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:34,387
She could probably use it.

713
00:29:39,561 --> 00:29:41,261
Dr. Shepherd.

714
00:29:41,329 --> 00:29:42,495
Yeah?

715
00:29:43,682 --> 00:29:45,716
Stephanie's a liar.

716
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:47,550
She was never sick.

717
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:49,286
She made the whole thing up.

718
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:53,385
Check the drains for
blood every two hours

719
00:29:53,409 --> 00:29:54,852
and page me when she's awake.

720
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:55,876
Okay.

721
00:29:55,944 --> 00:29:57,489
I'm gonna go let Abe know.

722
00:29:57,513 --> 00:29:59,157
Okay. Oh. Oh, my God. He's here.

723
00:29:59,181 --> 00:30:01,131
What? Who? He's here.

724
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,744
He's here, and he's hot. Oh,
my God. Help me. Save me. Help.

725
00:30:02,768 --> 00:30:04,034
Hey, Dr. Pierce?

726
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,138
Uh, what does he
want? What do you want?

727
00:30:08,207 --> 00:30:10,357
Is that your patient,
Gabby Margraff?

728
00:30:10,426 --> 00:30:12,658
Why? Why?

729
00:30:12,727 --> 00:30:14,944
I'm supposed to notify
her that her husband's died.

730
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:22,218
They were not married.

731
00:30:22,287 --> 00:30:23,803
They were just shacking up.

732
00:30:23,872 --> 00:30:27,240
Okay, but he put her down
as next of kin on his forms, so...

733
00:30:27,309 --> 00:30:30,405
Why are you... You are
an intern. Give me that.

734
00:30:30,429 --> 00:30:32,178
Yeah, she's not your patient.

735
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:33,691
This isn't your job.
Who sent you up here?

736
00:30:33,715 --> 00:30:35,548
Dr. Hunt ordered me.
It's a teaching thing.

737
00:30:35,617 --> 00:30:37,495
And I know the four
L's. Oh, you know what?

738
00:30:37,519 --> 00:30:39,552
Stop talking. "Four L's"?

739
00:30:39,621 --> 00:30:41,399
She's not even your
patient. Don't touch her!

740
00:30:41,423 --> 00:30:43,907
Don't go near her!
I'll deal with Hunt!

741
00:30:43,976 --> 00:30:47,427
Geez, what's her problem? It's
not like I want to be doing this.

742
00:30:47,496 --> 00:30:49,996
Her problem is
that there are rules

743
00:30:50,699 --> 00:30:53,667
and boundaries.

744
00:30:53,735 --> 00:30:56,681
And some people think that
you can just ignore all those rules,

745
00:30:56,705 --> 00:30:58,783
that you can cross
those boundaries,

746
00:30:58,807 --> 00:31:01,118
but just because protocol
is broken once in a...

747
00:31:01,142 --> 00:31:03,042
No, no, no. Once!

748
00:31:03,445 --> 00:31:05,077
Once.

749
00:31:05,146 --> 00:31:08,276
That the rules go out the
window, but they don't, okay?

750
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:11,779
Her problem is that
hot people should know

751
00:31:11,803 --> 00:31:14,850
that just because a person
does something that is reckless

752
00:31:14,874 --> 00:31:16,306
and likes it

753
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:20,160
does not mean that they are
going to keep doing that thing, okay?

754
00:31:20,229 --> 00:31:25,082
Her problem is that maybe she
is tired of scrapbooking and glitter,

755
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:27,195
but she does not know
who she is anymore,

756
00:31:27,219 --> 00:31:31,454
and everyone needs to just
give her the space to figure it out

757
00:31:31,523 --> 00:31:35,292
and stop asking her questions
and talking about jumbo condoms.

758
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,409
That...

759
00:31:37,712 --> 00:31:39,545
is Meredith's problem.

760
00:31:41,016 --> 00:31:42,198
Understand?

761
00:31:43,435 --> 00:31:44,829
Yeah, I think
that... Okay, good.

762
00:31:44,853 --> 00:31:46,019
Great.

763
00:31:49,141 --> 00:31:51,286
Dr. Shepherd, I promise
you... I've heard enough.

764
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:52,876
Dr. Shepherd.

765
00:31:52,945 --> 00:31:56,213
Uh, Grey tell you that I subbed
in for her class this morning?

766
00:31:56,282 --> 00:31:58,799
And I think I did the
neuro department proud.

767
00:31:58,867 --> 00:32:01,401
Dr. Webber, as
residency director,

768
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:03,136
you should know...

769
00:32:04,606 --> 00:32:06,956
Dr. Edwards abandoned
a patient this afternoon,

770
00:32:07,025 --> 00:32:10,577
and when questioned
about it, she lied to my face.

771
00:32:10,645 --> 00:32:13,964
A truly offensive lie
about being sick as a kid,

772
00:32:14,016 --> 00:32:15,615
and I bought it.

773
00:32:15,683 --> 00:32:16,683
I...

774
00:32:17,486 --> 00:32:18,918
I believed you.

775
00:32:19,939 --> 00:32:21,921
She told me... Dr. Shepherd.

776
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:27,227
What do you want me to do here?

777
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:31,154
She doesn't believe
me on her own.

778
00:32:35,937 --> 00:32:37,704
When she applied
to this program,

779
00:32:37,773 --> 00:32:40,657
I got a call from Keith
Wagner at St. Jude's.

780
00:32:40,726 --> 00:32:44,428
That sickle cell trial was
a milestone in his career.

781
00:32:44,496 --> 00:32:46,262
Wanted to tell me how
proud he was of her

782
00:32:46,332 --> 00:32:48,715
and how lucky
we'd be to have her.

783
00:32:48,784 --> 00:32:52,919
Hers was one of the few success
stories to come out of that trial.

784
00:32:52,988 --> 00:32:55,788
I don't understand why
Wilson told me you lied.

785
00:32:55,857 --> 00:32:58,057
Because Wilson doesn't know.

786
00:32:58,126 --> 00:32:59,537
Because I don't talk
about it anymore,

787
00:32:59,561 --> 00:33:00,905
because I'm not
a patient anymore.

788
00:33:00,929 --> 00:33:02,462
I am a surgeon.

789
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:06,516
And when I do talk about it,
I only tell people I can trust.

790
00:33:10,939 --> 00:33:13,357
Why didn't she just...

791
00:33:13,425 --> 00:33:16,710
Why didn't she just tell me
to confirm the story with you?

792
00:33:16,778 --> 00:33:18,812
Why did she let me... God.

793
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:23,683
How many hours?

794
00:33:24,553 --> 00:33:25,851
How many days?

795
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:30,073
How many surgeries have
you spent with Edwards?

796
00:33:30,142 --> 00:33:31,674
She's been your right hand.

797
00:33:31,743 --> 00:33:34,244
So why was it so easy
to question her integrity

798
00:33:34,313 --> 00:33:36,796
based on the word of a
doctor you hardly knew?

799
00:33:42,755 --> 00:33:43,755
God.

800
00:33:45,474 --> 00:33:46,474
Okay.

801
00:33:48,143 --> 00:33:50,183
Keep him in NPO... Hunt.

802
00:33:50,795 --> 00:33:52,206
What the hell is going on?

803
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:54,108
Sorry? I have an intern who says

804
00:33:54,132 --> 00:33:56,093
you sent him upstairs
to tell my patient...

805
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:58,652
I did. I'm giving them a crash
course in breaking bad news.

806
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,281
They need it. Oh.
"A crash course."

807
00:34:00,305 --> 00:34:02,838
Is that how this goes?
No, it's not how this goes.

808
00:34:02,907 --> 00:34:04,485
That is not how this works.

809
00:34:04,509 --> 00:34:06,949
Grey, this is a teaching hospital.
We teach from experience.

810
00:34:07,011 --> 00:34:08,611
Now, I've given
them the four L's...

811
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:11,192
The four L's are not enough.
These interns, they need a lot more.

812
00:34:11,216 --> 00:34:13,194
Of course they need more.
That's why they have to do it.

813
00:34:13,218 --> 00:34:15,935
They have to experience it.

814
00:34:16,004 --> 00:34:18,270
They have to live it.

815
00:34:18,339 --> 00:34:22,559
And to learn it, they have to
be up close and personal with it.

816
00:34:22,628 --> 00:34:24,494
<i>When you walk into a room</i>

817
00:34:24,563 --> 00:34:27,008
to tell someone that
their loved one has died,

818
00:34:27,032 --> 00:34:31,601
it's more than just a list of
bullet points you've memorized.

819
00:34:33,271 --> 00:34:37,840
Yours is the face they will
remember for the rest of their life.

820
00:34:37,910 --> 00:34:39,988
They were fine
before they met you.

821
00:34:40,012 --> 00:34:42,223
They picked up their
children from school,

822
00:34:42,247 --> 00:34:45,449
they made dinner,
and they got a call.

823
00:34:45,517 --> 00:34:49,686
The police showed up at their
door and brought them here

824
00:34:49,755 --> 00:34:52,889
with those children to this room

825
00:34:52,958 --> 00:34:57,210
so that you can give them the
worst news of their entire life.

826
00:34:58,863 --> 00:35:02,048
You are changing this
person's life forever.

827
00:35:02,117 --> 00:35:04,884
You are responsible
for this moment.

828
00:35:06,021 --> 00:35:09,522
For the instant that person

829
00:35:09,591 --> 00:35:12,658
goes from wife to widow is you.

830
00:35:12,728 --> 00:35:14,894
All you. Nobody but you.

831
00:35:14,963 --> 00:35:17,647
So, this person isn't
an inconvenience.

832
00:35:17,715 --> 00:35:21,218
They are not a box on
a list to be checked off.

833
00:35:21,286 --> 00:35:23,487
You are a part
of their life now.

834
00:35:24,689 --> 00:35:26,656
Your words, your face.

835
00:35:27,426 --> 00:35:29,626
So take that seriously

836
00:35:29,694 --> 00:35:32,195
and recognize the
importance of your role.

837
00:35:33,532 --> 00:35:35,732
And respect the fact
that that person's pain

838
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,800
is the biggest
thing in the room.

839
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:39,936
You got it?

840
00:35:59,006 --> 00:36:01,808
It's not closed forever, right?

841
00:36:01,877 --> 00:36:05,945
The orgasm train will
chug into the station again.

842
00:36:06,014 --> 00:36:07,414
It just...

843
00:36:07,482 --> 00:36:09,916
I'm just not wondering
what's out there.

844
00:36:11,887 --> 00:36:14,086
Not feeling like I'm
missing anything.

845
00:36:14,155 --> 00:36:16,790
I've had that great,
amazing love.

846
00:36:16,858 --> 00:36:18,324
And that part's behind me now,

847
00:36:18,393 --> 00:36:21,611
and I have the kids and
you guys and surgery, and...

848
00:36:23,882 --> 00:36:25,281
I'm happy.

849
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:28,567
And I never thought I
would be again and I am.

850
00:36:30,255 --> 00:36:31,587
And that's all I need.

851
00:36:38,129 --> 00:36:41,392
So, you just need to watch
those lines just like before.

852
00:36:41,416 --> 00:36:42,915
Good, good.

853
00:36:46,154 --> 00:36:47,353
Okay.

854
00:36:50,392 --> 00:36:51,591
There you go.

855
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:52,759
There you go, okay?

856
00:36:52,827 --> 00:36:54,077
Okay.

857
00:36:54,145 --> 00:36:55,745
I know this sucks.

858
00:36:55,813 --> 00:36:58,614
But we're gonna get
you in that chair, okay?

859
00:37:04,006 --> 00:37:05,221
Okay.

860
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:07,357
Go on. Keep hitting me.

861
00:37:07,426 --> 00:37:09,825
Keep hitting me.
We're almost there.

862
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:11,305
Keep hitting me. Focus on that.

863
00:37:11,329 --> 00:37:13,245
Focus on that.

864
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:17,183
You don't stop now until
we get you into this chair.

865
00:37:17,269 --> 00:37:19,435
Come on. You're
almost there, Rachel.

866
00:37:19,504 --> 00:37:21,271
Come on.

867
00:37:21,339 --> 00:37:23,672
Keep going. I know.
You're almost there.

868
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:25,191
You're almost there.

869
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:27,743
Come on.

870
00:37:27,812 --> 00:37:28,956
Come on, Rachel. Just one step.

871
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,012
There you go.

872
00:37:30,082 --> 00:37:31,714
Okay. Good. Good.

873
00:37:31,783 --> 00:37:33,461
Good job, Rachel. You did good.

874
00:37:35,337 --> 00:37:37,804
It's okay. You're
okay. You're okay.

875
00:37:39,407 --> 00:37:40,740
You did it.

876
00:37:44,012 --> 00:37:45,189
I need to step out

877
00:37:45,213 --> 00:37:46,373
for just a moment.

878
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:49,148
You did good.

879
00:37:53,621 --> 00:37:56,155
You did it. Good job.

880
00:38:01,029 --> 00:38:02,529
That was excellent.

881
00:38:03,147 --> 00:38:04,380
You saw?

882
00:38:06,351 --> 00:38:07,517
I did.

883
00:38:09,053 --> 00:38:10,870
Very, very well done.

884
00:38:21,566 --> 00:38:23,700
I'm sorry

885
00:38:23,768 --> 00:38:26,202
that I didn't believe
you. I should have.

886
00:38:27,522 --> 00:38:28,905
Thank you.

887
00:38:33,745 --> 00:38:36,985
Wait, aren't you supposed to
be throwing a party right now?

888
00:38:38,633 --> 00:38:39,633
Oh.

889
00:38:40,569 --> 00:38:41,634
Crap.

890
00:38:45,457 --> 00:38:46,577
DeLuca.

891
00:38:46,641 --> 00:38:48,941
Hey, look, I'm sorry, okay?

892
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:51,377
I didn't mean to cross
boundaries or not do my job,

893
00:38:51,445 --> 00:38:53,712
and I clearly pissed
you off and Dr. Grey.

894
00:38:53,782 --> 00:38:55,982
So I'm sorry, and if it's
about last night, I'm...

895
00:38:56,050 --> 00:38:57,116
Shh!

896
00:38:57,702 --> 00:38:58,702
Shush.

897
00:39:00,505 --> 00:39:01,545
Um...

898
00:39:04,492 --> 00:39:09,062
Um, okay, actually, I was
coming to apologize to you.

899
00:39:10,916 --> 00:39:13,449
That yelling was
not about today.

900
00:39:13,518 --> 00:39:15,334
It was about last night.

901
00:39:15,403 --> 00:39:16,653
Yeah, I knew that.

902
00:39:17,723 --> 00:39:19,756
Right, well, um,

903
00:39:19,825 --> 00:39:23,392
last night is not
going to happen again.

904
00:39:24,395 --> 00:39:26,395
It was very nice.

905
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:28,014
Was better than nice.

906
00:39:28,083 --> 00:39:29,323
But,

907
00:39:30,101 --> 00:39:31,300
I don't do this.

908
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:33,169
Hey, look, I don't
do this either, okay?

909
00:39:33,237 --> 00:39:35,504
I don't. But at the
bar, you were just so...

910
00:39:35,574 --> 00:39:37,290
You were so, also.

911
00:39:37,376 --> 00:39:39,942
And, uh, you're very...

912
00:39:41,329 --> 00:39:43,029
Thank you. Um, so are you.

913
00:39:43,097 --> 00:39:45,698
So, uh, it was a slip.

914
00:39:45,784 --> 00:39:48,551
Right. I get it. And,
you know what? I agree.

915
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:50,820
Okay, it never happened.

916
00:39:52,224 --> 00:39:53,256
Deleted.

917
00:39:55,376 --> 00:39:56,659
Thank you.

918
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:58,695
Thank you.

919
00:40:09,991 --> 00:40:13,271
<i>There are some things in life
that simply can't be avoided.</i>

920
00:40:31,179 --> 00:40:33,846
<i>No matter how
uncomfortable they make us.</i>

921
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:46,342
<i>And there can be rewards in
stepping outside of your comfort zone.</i>

922
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:07,329
<i>Even when the thought of
it makes us want to puke.</i>

923
00:41:07,365 --> 00:41:08,709
No, those are for the guests.

924
00:41:08,733 --> 00:41:10,813
Yeah, we came early
to eat the best part.

925
00:41:13,672 --> 00:41:14,938
Hey, where's Maggie?

926
00:41:15,006 --> 00:41:16,150
She was supposed
to be here with the ice

927
00:41:16,174 --> 00:41:17,552
and people are
already showing up.

928
00:41:17,576 --> 00:41:20,844
Maggie got held up at work.
She said she's on her way.

929
00:41:20,912 --> 00:41:22,632
Uh, the dryer finished
a little bit early,

930
00:41:22,681 --> 00:41:24,297
but the tablecloth's still damp.

931
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:28,079
It's fine. Just put it
on the table. Okay.

932
00:41:28,103 --> 00:41:29,547
<i>Even when we want nothing more</i>

933
00:41:29,571 --> 00:41:31,804
<i>than to run
screaming for the hills.</i>

934
00:41:32,773 --> 00:41:34,423
Oh, is that Jackson?

935
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:35,975
No, it's Callie.

936
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:37,410
Oh, God.

937
00:41:37,479 --> 00:41:39,874
I didn't know her new
girlfriend was a redhead.

938
00:41:39,898 --> 00:41:42,264
Oh, no. I need more
liquor. I'm not ready.

939
00:41:44,836 --> 00:41:45,836
Whoa.

940
00:41:48,156 --> 00:41:50,356
I'll get it.

941
00:41:50,425 --> 00:41:52,202
<i>That's why people
love to say that</i>

942
00:41:52,226 --> 00:41:54,306
<i>what doesn't kill you
makes you stronger.</i>

943
00:41:56,864 --> 00:42:00,115
Welcome. Hi,
Meredith. This is Penny.

944
00:42:02,604 --> 00:42:05,554
<i>The call to not get a
head CT was a bad call.</i>

945
00:42:05,623 --> 00:42:06,689
I'm so sorry.

946
00:42:06,758 --> 00:42:09,759
It was my job to
save him and I failed.

947
00:42:09,811 --> 00:42:11,844
Penny, this is Meredith.

948
00:42:13,547 --> 00:42:14,547
But I brought some wine.

949
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:16,332
<i>But sometimes...</i>

950
00:42:16,401 --> 00:42:18,450
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

951
00:42:18,519 --> 00:42:21,439
<i>Those people don't know what
the hell they're talking about.</i>
