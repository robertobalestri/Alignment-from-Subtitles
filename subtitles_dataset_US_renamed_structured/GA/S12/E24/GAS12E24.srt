1
00:00:03,037 --> 00:00:04,681
<i>They say love knows no bounds.</i>

2
00:00:04,705 --> 00:00:06,505
<i>I don't know about that.</i>

3
00:00:06,573 --> 00:00:08,807
<i>I feel like I've seen the bounds</i>

4
00:00:08,876 --> 00:00:10,787
<i>and pushed them
a couple of times.</i>

5
00:00:10,811 --> 00:00:13,645
It's gonna rain.
It's not gonna rain.

6
00:00:13,714 --> 00:00:15,481
Told her to have
the reception indoors.

7
00:00:15,549 --> 00:00:17,582
This wedding is
doomed even if it happens

8
00:00:17,651 --> 00:00:19,351
because it's
definitely going to rain.

9
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:21,531
You want it to rain.
You are willing it to rain.

10
00:00:21,555 --> 00:00:24,056
I am not willing it to rain.

11
00:00:24,125 --> 00:00:28,059
She's just so full of
feelings all the time.

12
00:00:28,128 --> 00:00:31,329
Why can't she just cram them
down and shut up like everybody else?

13
00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:33,009
You can't expect
her to be Cristina.

14
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:34,399
Exactly my point.

15
00:00:34,467 --> 00:00:37,218
She's definitely not
Cristina. That's what I mean.

16
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:39,921
Owen wants this?
Owen's marrying this?

17
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:43,111
He said yes when she asked.

18
00:00:44,111 --> 00:00:45,877
Jo still hasn't
given you a reason?

19
00:00:45,946 --> 00:00:47,679
I don't need a reason.

20
00:00:47,747 --> 00:00:49,626
She doesn't want to marry
me. I'm done. It's over.

21
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:52,584
Maybe it's nobody's fault.
Maybe you only get one.

22
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:55,837
One what?

23
00:00:55,905 --> 00:00:58,039
Soul mate? Or true love?

24
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:01,776
Well, then, who...

25
00:01:03,814 --> 00:01:05,613
Izzie?

26
00:01:05,682 --> 00:01:08,350
Alex, Izzie wasn't
your one true love.

27
00:01:08,436 --> 00:01:09,535
And even if she was...

28
00:01:09,603 --> 00:01:11,136
What was Derek?

29
00:01:11,204 --> 00:01:14,306
Are you telling me that you
think that's coming around again?

30
00:01:14,374 --> 00:01:17,075
That was different.

31
00:01:17,144 --> 00:01:18,988
How?

32
00:01:19,012 --> 00:01:21,680
<i>Love definitely has bounds.</i>

33
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:22,948
<i>I've seen where it ends.</i>

34
00:01:24,234 --> 00:01:26,568
I told you it was gonna rain.

35
00:01:26,637 --> 00:01:28,971
This wedding is doomed.

36
00:01:36,146 --> 00:01:39,381
Mom. Mom! Mother!

37
00:01:39,449 --> 00:01:42,050
I know I was engaged
before. I was there.

38
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:43,785
No.

39
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:45,904
I am sober.

40
00:01:45,973 --> 00:01:47,350
Because we love each other.

41
00:01:47,374 --> 00:01:48,751
Because we didn't
see a reason to wait.

42
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:51,070
Because people get hit by cars.

43
00:01:51,094 --> 00:01:52,672
We've been together for a year.

44
00:01:52,696 --> 00:01:55,230
Yes, we broke up, and then we...

45
00:01:57,968 --> 00:01:59,329
So what if it has
been off and on?

46
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:02,966
Oh, hey, don't let me forget
the rings, and I called the...

47
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:04,670
Shh, shh. Shh. What?

48
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:06,408
Amelia's mom.

49
00:02:06,477 --> 00:02:08,476
No one in the family is
coming to the wedding.

50
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:09,844
What?

51
00:02:09,913 --> 00:02:11,833
And ask her
permission to live my life.

52
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:14,466
Because I do.

53
00:02:14,535 --> 00:02:15,967
I'm alone.

54
00:02:16,036 --> 00:02:18,236
If you don't
come, it is just me.

55
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:19,438
Mom.

56
00:02:19,506 --> 00:02:22,791
Mommy, please, I
am getting married.

57
00:02:22,859 --> 00:02:25,027
Fine. Yeah, no. Um...

58
00:02:26,263 --> 00:02:27,679
Okay. I understand.

59
00:02:27,748 --> 00:02:29,948
Yeah, it's so good to know that

60
00:02:30,017 --> 00:02:32,784
all of the best people
in this family are dead.

61
00:02:35,422 --> 00:02:37,889
Amelia, hey.

62
00:02:42,396 --> 00:02:44,207
Rain is supposed
to be good luck.

63
00:02:52,723 --> 00:02:54,768
Hey, uh, do you want to
go over there together?

64
00:02:54,792 --> 00:02:55,941
Go over where?

65
00:02:55,993 --> 00:02:57,192
To the wedding.

66
00:02:57,261 --> 00:02:58,972
Do you want to drive
over together, or...

67
00:02:58,996 --> 00:03:02,029
Well, at this point, I don't
even know if I'm going.

68
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:05,800
Trauma's strapped for
surgeons and residents.

69
00:03:05,869 --> 00:03:08,503
Blake is gone. Wilson's off.

70
00:03:08,571 --> 00:03:09,832
You could always put me back in.

71
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:13,241
Don't. Yeah, I know, I know.

72
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:16,011
Still, if you're shorthanded,
just makes sense.

73
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:18,814
Ugh, good Lord.
You're just like Tuck.

74
00:03:18,882 --> 00:03:20,899
I tell you no... You keep
pushing and pushing

75
00:03:20,968 --> 00:03:22,467
like it's gonna change my mind.

76
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:25,131
You don't think four months is long
enough for me to learn my lesson?

77
00:03:25,155 --> 00:03:26,655
On a six-month suspension?

78
00:03:26,723 --> 00:03:28,306
No, I don't.

79
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,709
If you think a scheduling glitch

80
00:03:30,778 --> 00:03:33,361
will suddenly make me
trust you again in an OR...

81
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:34,963
Wait. "Trust me"?

82
00:03:35,031 --> 00:03:37,271
What do you mean, "trust me"?

83
00:03:39,186 --> 00:03:41,820
No, no. I get that you
needed to discipline me,

84
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:45,089
but you don't trust
me with patients?

85
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:51,362
It was a grave
error in judgment.

86
00:03:51,432 --> 00:03:53,632
And you're gonna trust me
again in two more months?

87
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,500
That's what it will take?

88
00:03:57,738 --> 00:04:01,072
Miranda, should
I be here at all?

89
00:04:01,141 --> 00:04:03,341
I'll see you at the wedding.

90
00:04:07,097 --> 00:04:09,075
I don't feel good about
how quiet it is in there.

91
00:04:09,099 --> 00:04:10,576
She's fine.

92
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,411
You have no idea how many
people have locked themselves

93
00:04:12,435 --> 00:04:13,702
in that bathroom.

94
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:15,203
They're always fine.

95
00:04:15,289 --> 00:04:18,490
I am serious, Mer.
I'm worried about her.

96
00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:20,392
This is her wedding day.

97
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,594
It's supposed to be the
happiest day of her life.

98
00:04:22,663 --> 00:04:26,464
The magic day, the love day.

99
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:32,220
Amelia, we're
here for you, okay?

100
00:04:32,289 --> 00:04:33,821
As long as it takes.

101
00:04:33,891 --> 00:04:37,192
Twenty more minutes and I'm
ripping the door off the hinges!

102
00:04:37,261 --> 00:04:40,378
Amelia, stuff your feelings in!

103
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:43,627
What? It's not my love
day. I have things to do.

104
00:04:44,918 --> 00:04:47,469
Okay. Where is
she? Oh, thank God.

105
00:04:47,538 --> 00:04:50,018
Amelia, open the door.

106
00:04:51,241 --> 00:04:52,307
Amelia?

107
00:04:56,163 --> 00:04:57,728
It doesn't matter.

108
00:04:58,865 --> 00:05:01,299
If they don't want
to be here, then...

109
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:04,702
They shouldn't be.

110
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:07,172
We don't want them.

111
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,918
They don't get it,
and they don't have to.

112
00:05:08,942 --> 00:05:10,675
I do.

113
00:05:10,743 --> 00:05:12,444
And I'll be there.

114
00:05:15,282 --> 00:05:17,382
And the only one
I want there is you.

115
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:24,534
You're not supposed to
see me before the wedding.

116
00:05:24,558 --> 00:05:27,659
It's bad luck. I'll close my
eyes. I won't see a thing.

117
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:31,996
Come out, Amelia.

118
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,366
Come out and marry me.

119
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:57,250
Okay. Go. I will see
you at the church.

120
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:01,192
I am an excellent best man.

121
00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:10,551
Forty-something male...

122
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,265
Multiple stab wounds
to the abdomen and arm.

123
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:14,956
He broke into an elderly woman's
apartment and attacked her.

124
00:06:15,025 --> 00:06:16,490
Oh, for God's sake.

125
00:06:16,559 --> 00:06:17,970
And the lady fought the
bastard off with a carving knife.

126
00:06:17,994 --> 00:06:19,260
Damn, Gram!

127
00:06:19,329 --> 00:06:20,673
Being controlled by an
inflated pressure cuff.

128
00:06:20,697 --> 00:06:22,130
Vitals are holding so far.

129
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:23,764
Ah! I was boiling an egg.

130
00:06:23,834 --> 00:06:25,333
He scared me near to death.

131
00:06:25,401 --> 00:06:26,835
I bet.

132
00:06:26,903 --> 00:06:29,337
Must've come in
through the window.

133
00:06:29,405 --> 00:06:32,140
Came up behind me in my kitchen.

134
00:06:32,209 --> 00:06:33,574
So I just... Hyah!

135
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:35,961
Yah-yah, yah-yah!

136
00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:37,556
Pressure on that, Cross.
- I'm trying.

137
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,292
Oh, here, I got it.

138
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:41,682
Is she... Is she okay?

139
00:06:41,751 --> 00:06:43,385
How about you
don't talk about her?

140
00:06:43,453 --> 00:06:45,653
Yeah, you picked the
wrong grandma today, bud.

141
00:06:46,356 --> 00:06:48,440
She's my mother.

142
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:51,442
I take care of her.

143
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:52,644
She has dementia.

144
00:06:52,713 --> 00:06:55,280
She didn't know it was me.

145
00:06:55,349 --> 00:06:56,598
She didn't know.

146
00:06:59,469 --> 00:07:03,154
It's all right. We'll need
to get you some x-rays.

147
00:07:03,223 --> 00:07:05,463
Can you move your thumb for me?

148
00:07:05,876 --> 00:07:07,842
Where were you?

149
00:07:07,911 --> 00:07:09,543
I'm sorry?

150
00:07:10,646 --> 00:07:12,981
You left me all
alone, and I had to...

151
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:14,999
You should've been there.

152
00:07:15,068 --> 00:07:18,228
You should've been there for
me, should've taken care of me.

153
00:07:19,289 --> 00:07:20,821
Louise, do you
know where you are?

154
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:26,544
That's what a husband does.

155
00:07:28,065 --> 00:07:29,448
Okay.

156
00:07:31,418 --> 00:07:34,619
Don't leave me.

157
00:07:34,688 --> 00:07:37,000
Don't leave. Don't leave
me. Oh, okay, all right.

158
00:07:37,024 --> 00:07:39,840
Don't leave me again. Please.

159
00:07:39,909 --> 00:07:41,225
Okay.

160
00:07:55,792 --> 00:07:57,032
Let's make a baby.

161
00:07:58,261 --> 00:07:59,693
What?

162
00:07:59,762 --> 00:08:01,840
You said that you wanted a baby,

163
00:08:01,864 --> 00:08:03,842
and you would make
an amazing dad.

164
00:08:03,866 --> 00:08:05,561
And that's what you're
worried about, right?

165
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:07,697
That I'm not all in? But I am.

166
00:08:07,721 --> 00:08:09,321
And I love you.

167
00:08:11,925 --> 00:08:13,765
Are you gonna tell me
why you won't marry me?

168
00:08:15,028 --> 00:08:17,395
I told you that I love you...

169
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:20,176
And that I'm not going anywhere.

170
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:23,720
So isn't that enough? Can't
that be enough for you?

171
00:08:26,073 --> 00:08:28,240
I was with Mer this
morning, and I was thinking,

172
00:08:28,308 --> 00:08:30,408
the two of us, we've
been through hell.

173
00:08:30,477 --> 00:08:32,477
You know, all kinds of drama...

174
00:08:32,545 --> 00:08:35,680
Crazy family stuff,
we both almost died,

175
00:08:35,749 --> 00:08:36,848
losing people we love.

176
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:38,427
No, you're not losing me.

177
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:40,291
The point is, we grew up.

178
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,020
Mer and I are grown up.

179
00:08:42,756 --> 00:08:44,389
We got through it.

180
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:45,724
And hell is behind me.

181
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:47,236
It's in my rearview mirror,
and I'm not going back.

182
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,528
I'm done.

183
00:08:49,596 --> 00:08:52,147
I'm not some idiot
kid anymore, Jo.

184
00:08:52,215 --> 00:08:53,964
I'm a man, and I'm
done with games.

185
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:56,750
I'm done with crazy.
I'm done with losing.

186
00:08:56,819 --> 00:08:58,987
I'm done with drama.

187
00:08:59,055 --> 00:09:00,788
I don't care about your secrets

188
00:09:00,857 --> 00:09:02,940
and your excuses and your drama.

189
00:09:02,993 --> 00:09:04,820
You know, I've had that.

190
00:09:04,844 --> 00:09:08,430
Alex, if we could just... I just
said I don't want to do this!

191
00:09:08,498 --> 00:09:14,035
I have never had one second
of anything real my entire life.

192
00:09:14,104 --> 00:09:15,420
I want truth.

193
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:18,105
I want a wife and a
house and a family!

194
00:09:18,174 --> 00:09:21,437
Amelia and Owen's
wedding today... I want that!

195
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,321
Hey. Hey.

196
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:51,973
Surprised to see you here.

197
00:09:52,558 --> 00:09:54,508
I work here.

198
00:09:54,577 --> 00:09:56,744
Well, I just figured you'd
be at the wedding by now.

199
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:04,502
So, um...

200
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:07,917
Do you have some time before
you have to be at the church?

201
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:09,373
Don't do that.

202
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:10,775
Do what?

203
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:14,378
Get any ideas.
Don't get any ideas.

204
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,726
There are no ideas here for
you. I don't have any ideas, okay?

205
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,227
This is... I'm just
making small talk.

206
00:10:18,251 --> 00:10:19,350
Okay, well, don't do that.

207
00:10:19,418 --> 00:10:20,496
Why not?

208
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,786
Because I'm busy. I'm working.

209
00:10:21,855 --> 00:10:23,554
Okay. I'm busy.

210
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,322
I'm working, too.

211
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:28,154
I'm not trying to be mean.

212
00:10:28,178 --> 00:10:31,045
I just... I don't want
you to get too attached.

213
00:10:31,114 --> 00:10:33,114
I have three
children, a big job.

214
00:10:33,149 --> 00:10:34,632
Okay, you jumped me.

215
00:10:34,701 --> 00:10:36,901
Okay, not that I
minded. It was good.

216
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,470
We had a good
time. It was very good.

217
00:10:39,539 --> 00:10:41,601
I don't know about you, but
that was some of my best work.

218
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:43,524
And in a car, which is
not easy. But now what?

219
00:10:43,593 --> 00:10:46,094
Now you think, what,
you're my sun and my moon,

220
00:10:46,162 --> 00:10:47,428
that all of a sudden

221
00:10:47,497 --> 00:10:49,430
I think that the stars
shine down on only you,

222
00:10:49,499 --> 00:10:51,883
that you touched me and
the heavens opened and I...

223
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:54,385
I'm blinded by the
angel that is you?

224
00:10:54,454 --> 00:10:56,254
I mean, you're good,
but nobody's that good.

225
00:10:58,041 --> 00:11:00,281
I did jump you, didn't I?

226
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:02,243
Yeah. You did.

227
00:11:07,283 --> 00:11:09,361
Okay, well, point taken.
You are not after me.

228
00:11:09,385 --> 00:11:11,319
I'm not after you.

229
00:11:11,388 --> 00:11:12,837
We are friends

230
00:11:13,707 --> 00:11:15,072
who maybe have sex.

231
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:17,002
We're friends who had sex once.

232
00:11:17,026 --> 00:11:20,661
We are friends that had
sex four times in one night,

233
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:22,864
but let's not get picky.

234
00:11:33,393 --> 00:11:35,938
Okay, yeah. So the
tux is here, shoes there.

235
00:11:35,962 --> 00:11:38,245
Um, is there anything
else you need?

236
00:11:38,315 --> 00:11:39,558
I'll be fine. You're good?

237
00:11:39,582 --> 00:11:41,294
And did you
remember black socks?

238
00:11:41,318 --> 00:11:42,717
Ah...

239
00:11:42,786 --> 00:11:44,485
Ha, I knew it.

240
00:11:44,553 --> 00:11:46,104
You know, thank God for you.

241
00:11:46,173 --> 00:11:48,623
This is why I had you
hold on to the rings.

242
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:51,676
Thank God for me.

243
00:11:52,828 --> 00:11:54,846
Oh!

244
00:11:54,914 --> 00:11:56,792
Hey, am I the first one
here? Do you have a car?

245
00:11:56,816 --> 00:11:58,227
Why? Do you have a car?

246
00:11:58,251 --> 00:11:59,931
Yes. Why? Okay.

247
00:12:01,103 --> 00:12:03,037
Ugh, damn it.

248
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:05,668
Hey. Hey.

249
00:12:05,692 --> 00:12:08,404
Uh, Amelia's next door. You
can go through there if you want.

250
00:12:08,428 --> 00:12:10,139
Here. Thanks.

251
00:12:10,163 --> 00:12:12,003
Big day today.

252
00:12:12,682 --> 00:12:13,848
Big step.

253
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:15,156
Mmm-hmm.

254
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:17,318
Really big step.

255
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:24,103
Meredith, why do you have a
problem with me marrying your sister?

256
00:12:24,127 --> 00:12:26,894
I don't, but I'm responsible.

257
00:12:26,963 --> 00:12:30,414
I mean, he left her to
me, and she left you to me.

258
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:32,867
I'm not a piece of
property for Cristina

259
00:12:32,936 --> 00:12:35,219
to just hand over
for safekeeping.

260
00:12:35,288 --> 00:12:37,188
I haven't told her.
Does she know?

261
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:39,523
No.

262
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,487
Don't you think you should call
her and tell her before you do this?

263
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:42,788
Why would I do that?

264
00:12:42,812 --> 00:12:44,306
She was the love of your life.

265
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,164
If it were me, I
would call Derek.

266
00:12:46,232 --> 00:12:49,867
I don't know... Just to see if
it came close to what we had.

267
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:53,438
Okay, look up for me.

268
00:12:56,493 --> 00:12:57,541
Amelia.

269
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:02,914
This is your love day.

270
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:06,451
It is a happy
day. It's so happy.

271
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:07,651
I'm happy.

272
00:13:09,272 --> 00:13:10,555
Amelia...

273
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:11,822
Nothing.

274
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:17,162
Derek was supposed to
walk me down the aisle.

275
00:13:18,365 --> 00:13:20,798
My dad's gone,
and he's always...

276
00:13:22,669 --> 00:13:26,120
He walked every one of
my sisters down the aisle.

277
00:13:26,189 --> 00:13:30,641
Well, I'm here, and Meredith
will be here any minute,

278
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:32,977
and we will all be together.

279
00:13:39,035 --> 00:13:41,302
I left the rings...

280
00:13:43,806 --> 00:13:45,366
I don't remember
where I left the rings.

281
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:48,153
Well, uh, they say
if you think out loud

282
00:13:48,177 --> 00:13:50,005
while you're looking for
something, you find it faster.

283
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:53,348
Who says? Scientists...
Who lose things.

284
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:55,182
Okay. Okay. All right.

285
00:13:55,252 --> 00:13:57,852
I remember there was one
point that I went upstairs.

286
00:13:58,555 --> 00:14:00,121
You okay?

287
00:14:00,189 --> 00:14:02,239
Yep. I'm fine.

288
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:05,387
Uh, I went upstairs, and
Amelia was in the bathroom.

289
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:06,677
And... Okay.

290
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,864
Hey. I'm here. Sorry I'm late.

291
00:14:17,123 --> 00:14:18,667
I had two patients
I had to discharge,

292
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:21,592
and Owen just
had cuff-link issues.

293
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:24,929
Are you okay?

294
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,032
Amelia?

295
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,834
You should probably go.

296
00:14:29,903 --> 00:14:32,681
Where's Maggie? She's
checking on the weather.

297
00:14:34,073 --> 00:14:36,219
It's raining. Didn't you notice?

298
00:14:36,243 --> 00:14:38,042
What's wrong? What's happening?

299
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:39,877
What can I do?

300
00:14:39,946 --> 00:14:42,280
What can you do?

301
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:44,448
What can you do?

302
00:14:44,517 --> 00:14:46,745
What... That is amazing.

303
00:14:46,769 --> 00:14:49,020
That is an amazing question.

304
00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:51,589
What can you do?

305
00:14:51,658 --> 00:14:52,940
Amelia.

306
00:14:53,008 --> 00:14:56,460
Meredith, I am
flipping out here.

307
00:14:56,529 --> 00:14:58,607
I'm wearing a wedding gown.

308
00:14:58,631 --> 00:15:00,776
There is a good and
decent man in there

309
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,701
who loves me and is
expecting to marry me,

310
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:06,215
and I can't tell if I am marrying
him because I love him back

311
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:09,307
or because I just ran here
and picked up a scalpel

312
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:12,076
and slipped into
this shepherd skin.

313
00:15:12,145 --> 00:15:14,123
And maybe it is right,
and maybe it's not,

314
00:15:14,147 --> 00:15:17,093
but I don't know, and I am
marrying Cristina's husband.

315
00:15:17,117 --> 00:15:19,495
I know what you
think about that.

316
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,830
And I don't know what I'm doing.

317
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:23,232
And there is no
one here with me.

318
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:26,357
There is no one
here to tell me to quit

319
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:29,560
or get me down the
aisle or... Help me.

320
00:15:29,628 --> 00:15:33,113
That is Derek's job,
and Derek is dead.

321
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:34,960
And all I have is Maggie,

322
00:15:34,984 --> 00:15:39,003
and Maggie is full of
sunshine and candy and hope,

323
00:15:39,072 --> 00:15:41,650
and every time I try to tell
her that the world is on fire,

324
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:45,025
she hands me a marshmallow
to roast, so that just leaves you.

325
00:15:45,094 --> 00:15:48,228
And you are rooting
for the other guy.

326
00:15:49,732 --> 00:15:53,000
You told me to go
and be with Owen,

327
00:15:53,069 --> 00:15:54,869
and then you turned on me,

328
00:15:54,938 --> 00:15:56,949
and now you are not on my side.

329
00:15:56,973 --> 00:15:59,484
And we both know you don't
like me, but you are stuck with me.

330
00:15:59,508 --> 00:16:03,410
So here I am in a wedding gown

331
00:16:03,479 --> 00:16:06,080
on the happiest
fricking day of my life

332
00:16:06,148 --> 00:16:09,483
in a room with no
family and no help

333
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:12,019
and no one on my side but you.

334
00:16:12,088 --> 00:16:16,807
So what can you do for me?
What can you do for me, Meredith?

335
00:16:17,627 --> 00:16:20,244
You're me.

336
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:22,646
What?

337
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:24,381
You're me before Derek.

338
00:16:25,852 --> 00:16:28,803
I can be here for you.
I know how to do this.

339
00:16:28,871 --> 00:16:31,138
I can be a trusted
sister for you.

340
00:16:31,207 --> 00:16:33,140
Just how do you
want to play this?

341
00:16:33,209 --> 00:16:35,220
Do you need me to tell
you you're a beautiful bride

342
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:36,910
and kick your ass
down that aisle?

343
00:16:36,979 --> 00:16:38,695
You're a beautiful bride.

344
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:41,232
Turn around. I'll start kicking.

345
00:16:41,301 --> 00:16:43,868
Do you need me to call
your mother and yell at her?

346
00:16:43,937 --> 00:16:45,286
I'm your girl.

347
00:16:45,354 --> 00:16:48,255
Do you need a shoulder
to cry on? I have two.

348
00:16:48,324 --> 00:16:50,475
If you want to freak
out and call it off,

349
00:16:50,543 --> 00:16:52,744
if you want to run, I'll
drive the getaway car.

350
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,915
Just let me know what you need.

351
00:16:57,984 --> 00:17:00,184
I'm here for you.

352
00:17:00,253 --> 00:17:01,985
I am your family, Amelia.

353
00:17:03,038 --> 00:17:06,123
Today, I am your person.

354
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:08,208
Just tell me what
you want to do.

355
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:17,129
- What are you doing?
- We're running.

356
00:17:17,153 --> 00:17:19,954
Oh!

357
00:17:20,023 --> 00:17:22,601
- Where are we running?
- Doesn't matter. Let's go!

358
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:23,724
Ah!

359
00:17:29,082 --> 00:17:30,322
Ah!

360
00:17:34,687 --> 00:17:36,754
Oh, God. So many people.

361
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:38,767
All those people! Okay, stop it.

362
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:40,936
And the food! Oh,
my... All that food.

363
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,626
Stop. Don't do that.

364
00:17:42,695 --> 00:17:45,730
The food doesn't matter.
Amelia's what matters.

365
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:49,100
Right. Okay. What happened?

366
00:17:49,168 --> 00:17:51,418
Nothing happened.
What's wrong with Owen?

367
00:17:51,488 --> 00:17:54,037
Nothing's wrong with Owen.

368
00:17:54,106 --> 00:17:56,034
Well, he could use some sun.

369
00:17:56,058 --> 00:17:57,619
There's nothing wrong with Owen.

370
00:17:57,643 --> 00:17:59,910
Then why are we doing this?

371
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:02,947
Okay, so then I
hung up the phone,

372
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:05,182
and I went over
to the table and...

373
00:18:06,953 --> 00:18:08,635
What? You okay?

374
00:18:08,704 --> 00:18:09,903
Found it.

375
00:18:11,357 --> 00:18:12,634
All right, look.
Let's get out of here.

376
00:18:12,658 --> 00:18:14,392
Okay. Ah!

377
00:18:15,712 --> 00:18:17,745
Okay, you're
having contractions.

378
00:18:17,814 --> 00:18:20,054
No. Braxton Hicks
all day. Ben, I'm fine.

379
00:18:20,082 --> 00:18:21,861
Mmm-hmm. Go on.
Sit down. Come on. No.

380
00:18:21,885 --> 00:18:23,929
We got to get these rings
over to Owen, and I'm gonna...

381
00:18:23,953 --> 00:18:27,688
Kepner, have a seat. Oh, boy.

382
00:18:27,757 --> 00:18:28,834
Okay, sitting sounds good.

383
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:30,924
Okay. It's good.

384
00:18:30,993 --> 00:18:34,311
So, I will repair this
tendon right here

385
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:36,430
and get you sewn right up.

386
00:18:36,516 --> 00:18:38,644
I didn't know you could do that.

387
00:18:38,668 --> 00:18:39,967
Are you a doctor?

388
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:41,185
I am.

389
00:18:41,237 --> 00:18:43,404
Oh, I'm confused.

390
00:18:44,173 --> 00:18:46,207
That's okay. Um...

391
00:18:46,275 --> 00:18:49,643
Louise, do you remember
your son at all? Donnie?

392
00:18:49,712 --> 00:18:51,712
Son? I...

393
00:18:52,682 --> 00:18:55,042
I don't have any children.

394
00:18:56,018 --> 00:18:57,117
Okay.

395
00:18:57,186 --> 00:18:58,619
Well, actually, you do.

396
00:18:59,755 --> 00:19:01,005
I'm having a baby?

397
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:02,668
We're having a baby? Whoops.

398
00:19:02,692 --> 00:19:04,870
No, that is not what I meant.

399
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:06,960
We're having a baby.

400
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:10,347
I can't wait. Mmm-hmm.

401
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,768
Uh, me neither.

402
00:19:15,221 --> 00:19:17,754
Congratulations.
You're dismissed, Doctor.

403
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:19,807
All right.

404
00:19:20,944 --> 00:19:22,184
Avery's with the mom,

405
00:19:22,211 --> 00:19:24,645
so I'll let him know
her son pulled through.

406
00:19:24,713 --> 00:19:27,097
Page me when he
wakes up. Mmm-hmm.

407
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:30,968
How was she in there?

408
00:19:31,037 --> 00:19:33,237
She's fine.

409
00:19:33,306 --> 00:19:35,106
Bailey, she's not fine.

410
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,207
Sofia keeps asking
me why Mom's so sad,

411
00:19:37,276 --> 00:19:39,877
and she wouldn't even
go to Owen's wedding.

412
00:19:39,946 --> 00:19:41,123
I feel like I should
do something.

413
00:19:41,147 --> 00:19:42,957
Robbins, there's
nothing you can do.

414
00:19:42,981 --> 00:19:44,693
This isn't your
business anymore.

415
00:19:44,717 --> 00:19:47,037
I... Now, look,
she lost her child.

416
00:19:47,086 --> 00:19:49,420
The woman she loved
moved across the country.

417
00:19:49,489 --> 00:19:51,533
So, no, she's not okay.

418
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:54,987
The only thing you can do
is get okay with it yourself.

419
00:19:57,446 --> 00:20:01,181
It's over. I had the love of
my life, and I just... Pssh.

420
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:04,184
Pushed him away,
and now he's gone.

421
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:05,953
I lost him.

422
00:20:06,022 --> 00:20:07,365
Let's not overstate this.

423
00:20:07,389 --> 00:20:08,934
He's just living at Meredith's.

424
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:10,791
Steph, you didn't see his face.

425
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:12,860
He's gone.

426
00:20:15,682 --> 00:20:18,482
Oh, God. I'm sorry. It's fine.

427
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:20,251
I'm sorry. He's not gone-gone.

428
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,735
Kyle is gone-gone.

429
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:23,304
Making it worse.

430
00:20:23,372 --> 00:20:25,984
Hey, can I get a cheeseburger,
rings to go, please? Thanks.

431
00:20:26,008 --> 00:20:27,541
Uh, hey, DeLuca,
are you working?

432
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:29,087
Ugh, I just got off
an 18-hour shift.

433
00:20:29,111 --> 00:20:32,680
I've been dreaming of this
cheeseburger and my bed.

434
00:20:32,749 --> 00:20:34,381
Wilson's your patient now.

435
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:35,911
I'm gonna go home. What?

436
00:20:35,935 --> 00:20:38,069
Make sure that she
doesn't drive or fall in a toilet

437
00:20:38,137 --> 00:20:40,704
or go anywhere near them.

438
00:20:40,773 --> 00:20:42,139
No, Dr. Edwards. Please.

439
00:20:45,227 --> 00:20:46,861
You don't have
to stay. I'm fine.

440
00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:54,418
Hey, could I get that for here?
- Sure.

441
00:21:01,327 --> 00:21:03,861
So, they're just gone?
All three of them?

442
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:05,729
Yeah, it would appear so, yeah.

443
00:21:05,798 --> 00:21:08,165
And they didn't say anything?

444
00:21:08,234 --> 00:21:10,968
They did not. Now,
let's just stay calm.

445
00:21:12,655 --> 00:21:15,322
I'm calm. I'm sure
there's a good reason.

446
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:16,791
They'll be back soon.

447
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:18,475
Absolutely.

448
00:21:18,544 --> 00:21:21,144
Hey, could you ask Kepner
to come here for a moment?

449
00:21:21,847 --> 00:21:24,181
Right. Um...

450
00:21:24,249 --> 00:21:26,684
It seems we've lost Kepner, too.

451
00:21:27,586 --> 00:21:29,303
What?

452
00:21:31,491 --> 00:21:33,340
Okay. Okay.

453
00:21:33,408 --> 00:21:35,036
Okay. Okay.

454
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,372
See, that one came a lot faster.

455
00:21:36,396 --> 00:21:37,789
They're a lot
closer together now.

456
00:21:37,813 --> 00:21:40,581
Maybe we should take this
party over to the hospital.

457
00:21:40,649 --> 00:21:43,400
Wait, wait, wait,
Ben. Wait, wait, wait.

458
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:45,496
I don't want to have
this baby in your car.

459
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,132
Neither do I. We're
going to the hospital.

460
00:21:47,156 --> 00:21:48,689
No. No, no.

461
00:21:48,758 --> 00:21:51,453
Okay, but figure my
contractions are close together

462
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:54,277
plus traffic plus
the rain plus...

463
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:55,640
I don't know... A
tree in the road?

464
00:21:55,664 --> 00:21:57,364
What, you're saying that you...

465
00:21:57,433 --> 00:21:59,611
I'm saying that between
your car and this house

466
00:21:59,635 --> 00:22:02,168
with heat, running
water, blankets...

467
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:03,887
I'll stay here. Yeah.

468
00:22:03,956 --> 00:22:05,417
I'm gonna have
this baby right here.

469
00:22:05,441 --> 00:22:06,969
April, no. Ben, come on.

470
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:09,426
It's having a baby at home.

471
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:11,139
People have done it in caves.

472
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:13,864
My mom did it once
in a barn, I think.

473
00:22:13,933 --> 00:22:16,467
We can do this. We
should just get in the car.

474
00:22:16,536 --> 00:22:17,646
Oh, oh, oh.

475
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:19,102
It's... Okay. Okay. Okay.

476
00:22:19,172 --> 00:22:21,412
But you know what? I'm gonna
call an ambulance, though.

477
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,806
Get us some help.

478
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:24,175
Okay.

479
00:22:24,911 --> 00:22:26,021
I'm gonna have a baby.

480
00:22:27,313 --> 00:22:29,024
You're gonna have a baby.

481
00:22:29,048 --> 00:22:30,447
On Meredith's rug.

482
00:22:30,516 --> 00:22:32,596
Right on Meredith's rug.

483
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:34,584
Oh!

484
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:40,373
Is it happening? Am I
having the baby now?

485
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:43,427
Okay, you need to relax.
I wish you could stay.

486
00:22:43,496 --> 00:22:45,879
I'm gonna stay right here
by your side the entire time.

487
00:22:45,948 --> 00:22:48,015
When you wake up,
I'm gonna be right here.

488
00:22:48,084 --> 00:22:49,324
Oh, you promise?

489
00:22:50,486 --> 00:22:52,719
I love you.

490
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:55,022
I love you. Okay.

491
00:22:57,243 --> 00:22:58,308
So weird.

492
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:00,544
No one say anything, please.

493
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:06,533
Warren has called 911, but I
might be having the baby here,

494
00:23:06,602 --> 00:23:09,602
so, uh, just, you
know, get here, please.

495
00:23:10,907 --> 00:23:12,901
Hey, you sure you
don't want to lie down?

496
00:23:12,925 --> 00:23:15,992
No. Uh...

497
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:18,157
I wish I had an epidural
for you. Don't need it.

498
00:23:18,181 --> 00:23:20,598
I am conquering the
pain with my mind.

499
00:23:20,666 --> 00:23:23,986
You weren't kidding. You
know how to have a baby.

500
00:23:25,788 --> 00:23:30,608
Okay, Ben, um, maybe
go wash your hands,

501
00:23:30,676 --> 00:23:33,894
'cause I need you to give me an
exam, because my water just broke.

502
00:23:33,963 --> 00:23:36,346
Okay. Okay.

503
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:39,449
You're probably gonna see
my vagina, which might be weird.

504
00:23:39,518 --> 00:23:41,680
Yeah, but, you know, I'm a
doctor, so, you know, it's all good.

505
00:23:41,704 --> 00:23:44,255
Okay. Right.

506
00:23:44,323 --> 00:23:46,784
Tap it and let it settle
and then tap it some more.

507
00:23:46,808 --> 00:23:48,275
You get more that way.

508
00:23:48,344 --> 00:23:50,744
Why am I doing this?

509
00:23:50,812 --> 00:23:52,830
Why did you make me do this?

510
00:23:52,898 --> 00:23:54,999
Why the hell would
you make me run?

511
00:23:55,067 --> 00:23:56,645
I didn't make you
run. You wanted to run.

512
00:23:56,669 --> 00:23:58,151
You dangled the carrot.

513
00:23:58,221 --> 00:23:59,931
You dangled it
because you didn't want

514
00:23:59,955 --> 00:24:01,533
this wedding to
happen, so you dangled.

515
00:24:01,557 --> 00:24:04,675
I didn't dangle anything.
You're not a victim here.

516
00:24:04,744 --> 00:24:06,994
I presented you with
a menu of options.

517
00:24:07,063 --> 00:24:08,695
You chose to run.

518
00:24:08,764 --> 00:24:10,630
You wanted to run.

519
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:12,539
You're right. You're right.

520
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:15,502
Why am I marrying Owen?

521
00:24:17,173 --> 00:24:18,905
Is my family right?

522
00:24:18,974 --> 00:24:22,042
Is this just one more in a long line
of ill-advised, impulsive decisions?

523
00:24:22,111 --> 00:24:23,911
I don't even know.

524
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:26,325
Shouldn't I know? Shouldn't
I know on my wedding day?

525
00:24:26,349 --> 00:24:28,229
Probably. Mer.

526
00:24:28,817 --> 00:24:30,528
I mean, what if I'm just...

527
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:32,164
What if Owen is my new drug

528
00:24:32,188 --> 00:24:34,348
and I'm just using him
to ignore the fact that...

529
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:37,958
That what?

530
00:24:38,027 --> 00:24:40,339
That Mer's right, that Owen's had
the love of his life and so have I,

531
00:24:40,363 --> 00:24:41,840
and once it's gone,
everything else is just filler

532
00:24:41,864 --> 00:24:43,208
and you'll never, ever
have that feeling again.

533
00:24:43,232 --> 00:24:45,112
I mean, who gets that twice?

534
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:49,702
Some of us would
like to have it once.

535
00:24:56,395 --> 00:25:01,165
So, he just kept asking me
to marry him again and again.

536
00:25:01,234 --> 00:25:04,579
I just couldn't say nothing
anymore, you know, so I just...

537
00:25:04,603 --> 00:25:05,914
Get you guys another round?

538
00:25:05,938 --> 00:25:07,538
I just said no.

539
00:25:08,306 --> 00:25:09,507
You could've said yes.

540
00:25:09,575 --> 00:25:11,141
Here you go.

541
00:25:12,678 --> 00:25:15,112
I should go home.
I need to go home.

542
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,831
What? Whoa, no, no, no.
You cannot drive home.

543
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:20,300
No, stupid, I'm gonna call.

544
00:25:20,369 --> 00:25:22,636
I'm looking for my
phone to call a goober.

545
00:25:23,773 --> 00:25:25,272
I can't marry him.

546
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:27,808
I want to, but I
can't marry anyone.

547
00:25:27,877 --> 00:25:29,254
Why's that? Just 'cause...

548
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:32,012
None of your business.
Okay. Right. Sorry.

549
00:25:32,081 --> 00:25:35,249
God, where is my... Oh, my God!

550
00:25:35,317 --> 00:25:37,084
What?

551
00:25:37,153 --> 00:25:39,348
This isn't even my purse.

552
00:25:39,372 --> 00:25:40,698
Yeah, what can I get you?

553
00:25:40,722 --> 00:25:44,658
I can't marry him because
I'm already married.

554
00:25:51,516 --> 00:25:54,601
Okay, okay. It's
done. Go. Do it.

555
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:57,304
Okay, you just relax, all
right? You know the drill.

556
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:01,340
You're gonna feel
my hand... Okay.

557
00:26:09,101 --> 00:26:10,445
Okay, Warren, let's wrap it up.

558
00:26:10,469 --> 00:26:12,919
Sorry. I just... I can't...

559
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:14,738
I don't know what I'm...

560
00:26:14,807 --> 00:26:15,984
Come on. You've done a
pelvic before, haven't you?

561
00:26:16,008 --> 00:26:18,141
Yeah, plenty, but
this doesn't feel right.

562
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:20,205
Don't tell me it doesn't feel
right. It's my freaking cervix.

563
00:26:20,229 --> 00:26:22,223
Just check how dilated
it is, and get out of my...

564
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:24,030
April...

565
00:26:24,934 --> 00:26:26,399
It's a foot.

566
00:26:27,219 --> 00:26:28,702
I feel a foot.

567
00:26:31,106 --> 00:26:33,523
No. It's breech.

568
00:26:33,593 --> 00:26:35,492
It's a footling breech.

569
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:38,362
Okay. Okay.

570
00:26:38,431 --> 00:26:39,629
And I feel the cord.

571
00:26:39,682 --> 00:26:41,514
What?

572
00:26:41,583 --> 00:26:44,284
No. No. Is there a pulse?

573
00:26:47,472 --> 00:26:49,856
Answer me! I don't think so, no.

574
00:26:49,925 --> 00:26:51,425
No.

575
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:56,007
So my baby's gonna die?

576
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:57,997
No, April. No.

577
00:26:58,067 --> 00:27:01,079
No, it just means that it's not getting
all the blood that it could be and that

578
00:27:01,103 --> 00:27:02,813
we have to get the baby
out as fast as possible

579
00:27:02,837 --> 00:27:04,082
so we can get the
pressure off the cord.

580
00:27:04,106 --> 00:27:06,840
Okay.

581
00:27:06,909 --> 00:27:09,943
So I need a C-section
as soon as possible.

582
00:27:10,012 --> 00:27:11,362
Yes.

583
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:13,396
Okay, okay, okay.

584
00:27:13,466 --> 00:27:14,932
Okay, um...

585
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:19,603
So... Okay.

586
00:27:19,672 --> 00:27:20,821
So...

587
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:24,386
The light is better
in the kitchen.

588
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:26,710
What? Wait, wait,
wait. No. No. No.

589
00:27:26,779 --> 00:27:28,256
I'm not giving you a C-section.

590
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,457
Look, there's an
ambulance coming.

591
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:31,598
Ben, we both know
it doesn't matter.

592
00:27:31,684 --> 00:27:34,134
I'm not doing it. I can't.

593
00:27:34,202 --> 00:27:36,331
We'll get you to the
hospital. My baby is dying.

594
00:27:36,355 --> 00:27:38,905
Its blood supply is cut
off, and it's going to die.

595
00:27:38,974 --> 00:27:40,340
There is an ambulance coming!

596
00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:41,925
Ben!

597
00:27:41,994 --> 00:27:45,279
Even if they were here
now, they can't help me.

598
00:27:45,347 --> 00:27:47,881
You can. It's coming.

599
00:27:55,724 --> 00:27:57,190
Come on.

600
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:09,419
Okay, I know, Ben. I know.

601
00:28:09,488 --> 00:28:11,088
I'm coming. I got held...

602
00:28:21,016 --> 00:28:25,819
Well, um, on the plus
side, um, you're well-liked.

603
00:28:25,887 --> 00:28:27,120
A lot of people came.

604
00:28:27,189 --> 00:28:29,322
And nobody wants to rush you.

605
00:28:29,391 --> 00:28:30,735
They just want to know
what's gonna happen.

606
00:28:30,759 --> 00:28:33,338
What do you think?
Here's what I think, Karev.

607
00:28:33,362 --> 00:28:34,939
I think if you get to the point

608
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:36,641
where you're gonna walk
down the aisle with someone,

609
00:28:36,665 --> 00:28:39,366
she's earned some trust...

610
00:28:40,102 --> 00:28:42,119
And faith.

611
00:28:42,187 --> 00:28:45,605
She's earned the
benefit of the doubt.

612
00:28:45,674 --> 00:28:47,223
So I'm giving it to her.

613
00:28:47,292 --> 00:28:49,259
She deserves that.

614
00:28:49,327 --> 00:28:51,011
You're right.

615
00:28:51,079 --> 00:28:53,380
You're absolutely right.

616
00:29:06,194 --> 00:29:07,227
Are we going in?

617
00:29:08,297 --> 00:29:09,847
Why are you looking at me?

618
00:29:13,335 --> 00:29:14,734
Amelia?

619
00:29:15,404 --> 00:29:17,137
I don't know.

620
00:29:17,206 --> 00:29:19,173
If we don't go in,
where would we go?

621
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:23,538
Why's everybody asking
me? Come on, Mer.

622
00:29:23,562 --> 00:29:25,194
What do I know
about getting married?

623
00:29:25,264 --> 00:29:28,181
And who am I to say we only
get one great love in our life?

624
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:29,800
Lots of people get two.

625
00:29:30,903 --> 00:29:32,236
Look at...

626
00:29:35,073 --> 00:29:36,773
Look at...

627
00:29:36,842 --> 00:29:38,553
Well, I don't know. I can't
think of any right now, but...

628
00:29:38,577 --> 00:29:40,622
Richard Webber. Yes!
Exactly. Thank you.

629
00:29:40,646 --> 00:29:42,478
Richard Webber.
Exactly. You see?

630
00:29:42,547 --> 00:29:46,111
Maybe we get two, maybe
we get 11, maybe we get 30.

631
00:29:46,135 --> 00:29:49,264
Isn't that better, just
to believe that? Yeah.

632
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:51,188
I mean, Owen believes it.

633
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,680
I swear he does.
And he loves you.

634
00:29:53,726 --> 00:29:55,904
And maybe this time
is different for you.

635
00:29:55,928 --> 00:29:58,411
Maybe this time, you're right.

636
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:11,991
All right, now, listen.
There's no anesthesia.

637
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:14,461
Ice is all we got, so
the pain's gonna...

638
00:30:15,714 --> 00:30:17,575
The pain's gonna be bad.

639
00:30:17,599 --> 00:30:19,983
Okay. All right?
Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

640
00:30:20,052 --> 00:30:21,852
Okay.

641
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:24,465
Wait, why is she at
Meredith's? I got to get my keys.

642
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:26,256
No, no. There's no time. Here.

643
00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:28,558
Right. You rotate the
baby in utero... Face down.

644
00:30:28,626 --> 00:30:31,146
No, I know. The position will
look different than you've seen.

645
00:30:31,179 --> 00:30:32,379
Okay. Is she okay?

646
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:33,697
April? April?

647
00:30:33,766 --> 00:30:35,132
<i>Hey, April? Can she hear me?</i>

648
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,078
Jackson, Jackson!
Jackson, I'm here.

649
00:30:37,102 --> 00:30:38,312
<i>Okay, okay, I'm right here.</i>

650
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,635
<i>Okay? I'm right here.</i>

651
00:30:39,705 --> 00:30:41,071
Okay. Okay. Okay.

652
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:42,189
Ha! Jackpot!

653
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:43,768
What? It's an old medical bag.

654
00:30:43,792 --> 00:30:45,520
It must've been her mom's.

655
00:30:45,544 --> 00:30:48,678
There's some gauze
and... A scalpel.

656
00:30:51,783 --> 00:30:53,983
And some lidocaine? No.

657
00:30:54,053 --> 00:30:55,747
Hey, Warren, what do
you have to pack her with?

658
00:30:55,771 --> 00:30:57,070
Uh...

659
00:30:59,258 --> 00:31:00,991
Dish towels.

660
00:31:02,761 --> 00:31:03,893
Okay.

661
00:31:06,014 --> 00:31:07,230
Can you feel that?

662
00:31:07,298 --> 00:31:08,565
Yeah.

663
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:15,288
Okay, Ben, I need you to
promise me something, okay?

664
00:31:15,357 --> 00:31:17,302
Yeah. If you feel like
you're gonna lose me,

665
00:31:17,326 --> 00:31:19,153
if I'm bleeding out, you... No.

666
00:31:19,177 --> 00:31:21,506
You make sure that
this baby is okay.

667
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:22,807
Oh. No, no, no. April, do not...

668
00:31:22,831 --> 00:31:24,547
Ben, don't listen to her, okay?

669
00:31:24,616 --> 00:31:26,633
You save her. You
save both of them.

670
00:31:26,719 --> 00:31:30,420
You promise me that you will
save this baby, no matter what.

671
00:31:31,272 --> 00:31:32,906
Ben, okay?

672
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:35,219
<i>Warren, you have got this.
You have got them both.</i>

673
00:31:35,243 --> 00:31:36,554
<i>Ben, please. Okay?</i>

674
00:31:36,578 --> 00:31:38,662
<i>Please.</i> Everybody,
just quiet! Please.

675
00:31:43,135 --> 00:31:45,302
Miranda? Yes?

676
00:31:47,672 --> 00:31:49,706
I want to do this, all right?

677
00:31:49,775 --> 00:31:52,442
I have to do this, all right?

678
00:31:52,511 --> 00:31:53,777
I know.

679
00:31:53,845 --> 00:31:55,362
Ben, don't hang up.

680
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:57,614
I trust you.

681
00:32:11,663 --> 00:32:12,846
Okay. Okay.

682
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:26,826
Okay.

683
00:32:29,964 --> 00:32:31,564
What's happening?

684
00:32:39,041 --> 00:32:40,607
April, please?

685
00:32:43,912 --> 00:32:45,878
Say something. Ben?

686
00:33:45,307 --> 00:33:47,807
Oh, oh, oh. Hey, hey, hey.

687
00:33:47,875 --> 00:33:50,276
Okay, come on. Come on, now.

688
00:33:50,345 --> 00:33:52,545
Okay. Here we go. Bedtime.

689
00:33:53,848 --> 00:33:56,208
Let me get you some water, okay?

690
00:33:56,718 --> 00:33:58,935
I was living in my car.

691
00:33:59,004 --> 00:34:01,099
Did you know that I lived in
my car? Whoa, whoa. Hey, hey.

692
00:34:01,123 --> 00:34:03,563
Where are you going? Whoa.

693
00:34:03,625 --> 00:34:07,777
And then I met him, and I
wasn't living in my car anymore.

694
00:34:07,846 --> 00:34:10,180
Everybody loved him.

695
00:34:10,249 --> 00:34:11,865
I did.

696
00:34:11,933 --> 00:34:13,283
What are you doing?

697
00:34:13,351 --> 00:34:14,884
I'm gonna go to bed.

698
00:34:14,953 --> 00:34:17,037
Okay. Um, I should go.

699
00:34:17,105 --> 00:34:18,872
Okay, you're good, right?

700
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:21,908
Never wanted anyone
to stop loving him.

701
00:34:23,244 --> 00:34:25,056
So if I...

702
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:28,280
I bought the wrong
something, he would...

703
00:34:29,318 --> 00:34:31,638
He would hit me in my face.

704
00:34:32,321 --> 00:34:33,353
Hey.

705
00:34:33,422 --> 00:34:35,271
Or my stomach. Or...

706
00:34:36,458 --> 00:34:39,376
Nobody knew that but me.

707
00:34:40,779 --> 00:34:43,346
So I ran.

708
00:34:44,649 --> 00:34:46,930
I had to make sure he
would never find me.

709
00:34:49,021 --> 00:34:50,661
And if you try to divorce him...

710
00:34:53,541 --> 00:34:55,541
He would find me.

711
00:34:56,712 --> 00:34:58,661
Does Karev know
about any of this?

712
00:34:59,531 --> 00:35:00,963
No.

713
00:35:01,032 --> 00:35:03,895
Alex would try and
protect me, but he can't.

714
00:35:03,919 --> 00:35:05,685
Not from this.

715
00:35:06,755 --> 00:35:09,405
He doesn't even
know my real name.

716
00:35:09,475 --> 00:35:11,608
You should tell him.
He'll understand.

717
00:35:11,677 --> 00:35:13,009
Karev's a really...

718
00:35:13,078 --> 00:35:14,177
Okay, hey, don't.

719
00:35:14,246 --> 00:35:16,045
Okay, don't do that, okay?

720
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:17,597
Let's get you
into bed, all right?

721
00:35:17,665 --> 00:35:19,465
No. Stop.

722
00:35:27,725 --> 00:35:29,676
Okay, no.

723
00:35:32,147 --> 00:35:33,580
Dr. Karev, hold on.

724
00:35:33,648 --> 00:35:34,964
Okay! What are you...

725
00:35:35,033 --> 00:35:37,117
Alex!

726
00:35:37,185 --> 00:35:39,519
Alex!

727
00:35:45,093 --> 00:35:48,011
Hey. What are you doing here?

728
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,495
They asked me to give you this.

729
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:51,097
Well, Kepner's the...

730
00:35:51,165 --> 00:35:52,794
Well, she forgot the
rings at Meredith's,

731
00:35:52,818 --> 00:35:55,318
and then everything
went sideways and...

732
00:35:56,471 --> 00:35:58,471
It's a girl. She had the baby?

733
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:00,156
Yeah. Some...

734
00:36:00,225 --> 00:36:04,093
Well, I know you'll hear
about it, but, anyway, here.

735
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:05,495
Thanks.

736
00:36:07,566 --> 00:36:09,460
You know, you
didn't have to do this.

737
00:36:09,484 --> 00:36:11,133
I know.

738
00:36:12,471 --> 00:36:14,771
It's funny. Um...

739
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:17,918
The way things are going,
I'm not sure Amelia and I are...

740
00:36:19,077 --> 00:36:20,721
Hey. Hey.

741
00:36:20,745 --> 00:36:22,212
She's back. Where is she?

742
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,757
No, she doesn't
want to see you now.

743
00:36:23,781 --> 00:36:25,159
What? Before the ceremony...

744
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:28,063
It's bad luck. Hurry
up and get in there.

745
00:36:28,103 --> 00:36:29,280
I mean, she needs 10 minutes.

746
00:36:29,304 --> 00:36:30,987
Okay. All right.

747
00:36:31,056 --> 00:36:32,805
Okay. All right.

748
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:34,941
Hey, um...

749
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:36,359
Happy for you, man.

750
00:36:36,845 --> 00:36:38,644
Thanks.

751
00:36:38,713 --> 00:36:40,646
Oh, hey, um...

752
00:36:40,715 --> 00:36:42,515
There'll be food after.

753
00:36:47,539 --> 00:36:49,172
So, are you staying, then?

754
00:36:51,243 --> 00:36:52,542
I might.

755
00:36:53,911 --> 00:36:55,945
Yeah, I mean, I like a wedding.

756
00:36:56,014 --> 00:36:58,832
It's funny. Owen was
supposed to be my best man.

757
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:05,104
Anyway, what about you?
Did you have a big wedding?

758
00:37:05,173 --> 00:37:06,506
No.

759
00:37:06,574 --> 00:37:08,654
We wrote our vows on a...

760
00:37:09,778 --> 00:37:12,879
On a Post-it note.

761
00:37:12,947 --> 00:37:14,563
He was afraid of commitment?

762
00:37:14,632 --> 00:37:16,782
No, just the
opposite. It was me.

763
00:37:16,852 --> 00:37:20,286
He loved me so
much, he didn't care.

764
00:37:20,354 --> 00:37:23,089
Poor guy. I barely
gave him a wedding.

765
00:37:26,161 --> 00:37:27,927
What'd you give him?

766
00:37:27,996 --> 00:37:29,696
We went to City Hall.

767
00:37:29,765 --> 00:37:31,414
Just the two of us.

768
00:37:33,335 --> 00:37:34,400
Nice.

769
00:37:34,469 --> 00:37:36,469
Yeah, it was very nice.

770
00:37:38,674 --> 00:37:40,156
Megan, um...

771
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:42,792
She wanted a huge wedding.

772
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:46,045
She said, "Like a big party."

773
00:37:47,649 --> 00:37:49,794
Derek would've
loved a big party.

774
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:58,157
I should get in there.

775
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:00,410
You should.

776
00:38:15,944 --> 00:38:18,655
Is this when we go? Do
we go? Did we miss it?

777
00:38:18,679 --> 00:38:21,381
Just go whenever you want.

778
00:38:21,449 --> 00:38:23,243
You sure you don't want to
run? Now's your last chance.

779
00:38:23,267 --> 00:38:24,867
Please shut up.

780
00:38:24,936 --> 00:38:27,570
We have to go. I'm going.

781
00:38:30,475 --> 00:38:31,715
You look beautiful.

782
00:38:33,194 --> 00:38:34,594
Congratulations.

783
00:38:46,458 --> 00:38:48,291
<i>Love has boundaries.</i>

784
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,759
<i>We know this.</i>

785
00:38:52,647 --> 00:38:54,180
I tried my best.

786
00:38:54,249 --> 00:38:55,693
Please know that if I
could've done more...

787
00:38:55,717 --> 00:38:58,401
I know. I do.

788
00:39:10,214 --> 00:39:12,048
She's stable.

789
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:16,953
Yeah, uh, Robbins is closing.

790
00:39:17,022 --> 00:39:21,307
Your baby girl has
a very strong mother.

791
00:39:22,844 --> 00:39:24,410
Yeah, she does.

792
00:39:25,764 --> 00:39:27,230
Dr. Warren.

793
00:39:37,558 --> 00:39:39,758
Dr. Robbins tells me that

794
00:39:39,828 --> 00:39:43,629
you showed superb technique

795
00:39:43,698 --> 00:39:45,798
under trying conditions.

796
00:39:47,935 --> 00:39:50,453
She said you saved
two lives today.

797
00:39:50,522 --> 00:39:53,757
<i>We knock them down,
build them back up,</i>

798
00:39:53,825 --> 00:39:55,475
<i>and knock them down again...</i>

799
00:39:56,077 --> 00:39:57,176
Oh...

800
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:13,543
<i>But does it have to be that way?</i>

801
00:40:26,041 --> 00:40:29,325
Hi, Mama! Hi! What's going on?

802
00:40:33,281 --> 00:40:35,831
Plane tickets.

803
00:40:37,418 --> 00:40:39,719
Bring her back next weekend.

804
00:40:39,787 --> 00:40:43,072
And I want all summer
and every other school year.

805
00:40:43,141 --> 00:40:45,102
I want Christmas this time,
but you can get next time

806
00:40:45,126 --> 00:40:47,910
and we'll figure out
the rest of the details.

807
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:52,298
What? Are you saying...

808
00:40:52,367 --> 00:40:54,317
Listen, we did this wrong.

809
00:40:55,353 --> 00:40:57,119
We had a chance to do it right,

810
00:40:58,456 --> 00:40:59,606
and we missed it.

811
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:02,115
Are you saying...

812
00:41:02,176 --> 00:41:03,909
I'm saying that

813
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,546
Sofia deserves to
have two happy moms.

814
00:41:09,317 --> 00:41:13,519
I'm saying let's all be happy.

815
00:41:18,727 --> 00:41:20,593
Thank you.

816
00:41:22,364 --> 00:41:24,096
<i>Can't we learn?</i>

817
00:41:24,165 --> 00:41:25,998
<i>Can't we be brave?</i>

818
00:41:26,067 --> 00:41:28,300
<i>Can't we believe?</i>

819
00:41:28,369 --> 00:41:30,753
<i>Because maybe
that's all we need...</i>

820
00:41:31,957 --> 00:41:33,823
<i>A little courage,</i>

821
00:41:34,493 --> 00:41:35,674
<i>a little hope,</i>

822
00:41:36,461 --> 00:41:38,244
<i>a little belief.</i>

823
00:41:41,583 --> 00:41:44,250
She looks so lovely.

824
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:48,520
<i>Maybe there are no boundaries
if we choose to not see them.</i>

825
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:53,192
<i>Maybe love is unlimited
if we're just brave enough</i>

826
00:41:53,261 --> 00:41:55,794
<i>to decide love is limitless.</i>

827
00:41:57,465 --> 00:42:00,032
<i>Maybe there's enough
happy for everyone.</i>

828
00:42:01,569 --> 00:42:03,068
I like him.

829
00:42:03,871 --> 00:42:05,138
Who?

830
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:07,006
Riggs.

831
00:42:09,243 --> 00:42:10,843
I really like him.

832
00:42:12,013 --> 00:42:13,912
I think he likes me.

833
00:42:13,982 --> 00:42:16,582
<i>Or maybe...</i>

834
00:42:16,650 --> 00:42:18,351
<i>Give me a minute.</i>

835
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:20,636
<i>I'll think of something.</i>
