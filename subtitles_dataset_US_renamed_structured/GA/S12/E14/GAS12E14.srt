1
00:00:02,203 --> 00:00:03,730
<i>Previously on</i> Grey's Anatomy...

2
00:00:03,754 --> 00:00:05,816
<i>Dr. Hunt and I go back a bit.</i>

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,101
<i>She's joining the program
at Grey-Sloan Memorial.</i>

4
00:00:08,125 --> 00:00:09,936
Perfect Penny killed my
husband. Get her out of my house.

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,377
Wilson, go away!

6
00:00:11,445 --> 00:00:13,445
If you're out with Grey,
you're out, and I'm out.

7
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:15,975
You just signed divorce papers,
and you don't want a drink?

8
00:00:15,999 --> 00:00:17,494
What are you,
pregnant? I think I am.

9
00:00:17,518 --> 00:00:18,850
You have to tell him.

10
00:00:18,919 --> 00:00:20,563
Obviously, I'm going to
tell him. When I'm ready.

11
00:00:20,587 --> 00:00:22,954
If you want to start
over, forget all that.

12
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:24,501
<i>Well, let's do
it.</i> Just like new?

13
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:25,974
This is Major Thorpe.

14
00:00:26,043 --> 00:00:26,942
<i>It's great what
you did in there.</i>

15
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:28,710
<i>I'm just glad I saw it.</i>

16
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:29,923
Well, we said we'll
follow up, and we will.

17
00:00:29,947 --> 00:00:31,629
I'd like that... To
follow up with you.

18
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:33,226
<i>That guy definitely just
asked for your number.</i>

19
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:35,531
And that's what
flirting looks like.

20
00:00:54,538 --> 00:00:56,166
<i>When babies are born,</i>

21
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:58,924
<i>they usually come out crying
like there's no tomorrow.</i>

22
00:00:58,992 --> 00:01:01,275
<i>It's loud. It's jarring.</i>

23
00:01:04,648 --> 00:01:06,114
<i>And it's completely unfair.</i>

24
00:01:08,685 --> 00:01:10,585
<i>That adorable, tiny baby</i>

25
00:01:10,654 --> 00:01:13,105
<i>was forced out of
its mother's womb.</i>

26
00:01:17,828 --> 00:01:19,928
<i>And forced to
breathe outside air</i>

27
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:22,497
<i>into its brand-new little lungs.</i>

28
00:01:22,566 --> 00:01:24,132
<i>It's human nature.</i>

29
00:01:24,201 --> 00:01:27,386
<i>No one wants to be
left out in the cold...</i>

30
00:01:27,455 --> 00:01:29,288
<i>Rejected and alone.</i>

31
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:37,746
I want to meet with the
residents immediately.

32
00:01:37,814 --> 00:01:40,048
When a bedridden
patient stays in one place,

33
00:01:40,116 --> 00:01:41,266
what's the outcome?

34
00:01:41,335 --> 00:01:43,079
Bedsores. RICHARD: Exactly.

35
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:45,749
When a surgeon stays in
one place, what's the outcome?

36
00:01:45,773 --> 00:01:47,372
One of us has bedsores?

37
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:49,841
Stagnation. Complacency.

38
00:01:49,894 --> 00:01:51,360
A limited mind.

39
00:01:51,428 --> 00:01:53,340
You have a short time
to learn here, people,

40
00:01:53,364 --> 00:01:55,275
and you've snuggled
up to your specialties

41
00:01:55,299 --> 00:01:57,766
like a warm, comfy bed.

42
00:01:57,835 --> 00:01:59,918
Well, I am your alarm clock.

43
00:01:59,986 --> 00:02:03,221
I'm pulling you out of bed
and broadening your education.

44
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,824
This is a Resident Scramble.

45
00:02:05,892 --> 00:02:08,043
This is filled with
attendees' names.

46
00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:10,061
Come on up and
draw your new service,

47
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,847
at random.

48
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:17,914
Bingo, Shepherd. Put it back!

49
00:02:19,023 --> 00:02:20,663
But I... Back.

50
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:28,287
Dr. Grey, I was
told to report to...

51
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:30,293
Did you see the scans?
Yeah, I'm sorry I'm late.

52
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:31,861
I just got off the phone
with Bauer Medical.

53
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:33,363
They said that
Carson's recovering well

54
00:02:33,387 --> 00:02:35,587
and his incision sites
and flaps are doing great.

55
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:36,671
That is great news.

56
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:40,058
Yeah, Dr. Thorpe
thought so, too.

57
00:02:40,126 --> 00:02:42,071
He also thought you might've
given him the wrong number.

58
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:43,695
Thorpe? Who is Thorpe?

59
00:02:43,763 --> 00:02:45,197
He has the right number.

60
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:48,433
Oh. Okay, so you're just
gonna what, ignore his calls?

61
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:51,598
Wait. Will someone please tell me
what is going on and who "he" is?

62
00:02:51,622 --> 00:02:55,607
Meredith exchanged numbers with
a hot military surgeon over at Bauer.

63
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:58,310
He says he called,
but radio silence.

64
00:02:58,378 --> 00:02:59,422
What?

65
00:02:59,446 --> 00:03:00,612
It's nothing.

66
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:02,125
Why wouldn't you tell me this?

67
00:03:02,149 --> 00:03:04,732
- Because it's nothing.
- Mmm-hmm.

68
00:03:04,801 --> 00:03:06,045
Wilson, are you following me?

69
00:03:06,069 --> 00:03:07,513
I'm with you today.
I'm on your service.

70
00:03:07,537 --> 00:03:08,870
Blake is with me.

71
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:10,784
No, actually, all of the
residents were switched.

72
00:03:10,808 --> 00:03:12,285
You need to go
talk to Blake, then,

73
00:03:12,309 --> 00:03:14,592
because I don't have the
time to get you up to speed.

74
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,733
So, how hot is hot?

75
00:03:21,802 --> 00:03:23,601
We have surgery.

76
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:26,455
Hot.

77
00:03:27,924 --> 00:03:29,803
I heard there were puppies!

78
00:03:29,827 --> 00:03:31,070
I thought it'd be
weird, you know,

79
00:03:31,094 --> 00:03:33,339
the small talk, the eye contact,

80
00:03:33,363 --> 00:03:35,697
the polite eating,
but really, it wasn't.

81
00:03:35,766 --> 00:03:37,265
I mean, she was nice.

82
00:03:37,334 --> 00:03:38,767
It was nice.

83
00:03:38,836 --> 00:03:40,046
So you're getting
out there, huh?

84
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:41,636
I don't know about that.

85
00:03:41,705 --> 00:03:44,256
I mean, it was sudden,
but yeah, it was a date.

86
00:03:45,825 --> 00:03:47,125
Does Kepner know about it?

87
00:03:47,193 --> 00:03:49,694
No. No, and do
not tell her, okay?

88
00:03:49,763 --> 00:03:50,962
Sure. Whatever.

89
00:03:51,031 --> 00:03:52,375
I mean, I'm not lying, you know?

90
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:54,443
I just don't want her to
hear it from someone else.

91
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:55,544
I mean, I'll tell her,

92
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:57,113
you know, when
the time is right.

93
00:03:57,137 --> 00:03:58,453
Uh-huh.

94
00:03:58,522 --> 00:04:00,033
Uh, we all hear the dogs, right?

95
00:04:00,057 --> 00:04:01,356
There are dogs somewhere.

96
00:04:01,425 --> 00:04:02,802
Once a month, a
rescue group brings in

97
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:04,326
a bunch of puppies for the kids.

98
00:04:04,394 --> 00:04:06,256
It's good for morale
and healing and crap.

99
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,540
No. What's the matter?

100
00:04:07,564 --> 00:04:09,348
Okay, I'm on peds today. No.

101
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:10,499
Hope you like dogs.

102
00:04:13,721 --> 00:04:15,487
Hey. Long night?

103
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:17,350
Seventy-five-year-old man
ran his car into an electrical pole.

104
00:04:17,374 --> 00:04:19,841
Electrocution and a
big intracranial bleed.

105
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:21,676
And a pacemaker implantation.

106
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:26,731
So I booked a
reservation around 8:00,

107
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,028
so we should maybe head
out around 7:00. That work?

108
00:04:29,052 --> 00:04:30,413
Yeah, I can do that. Okay.

109
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:31,653
How fancy is this?

110
00:04:31,721 --> 00:04:34,272
Well, first date, so
I took a big swing.

111
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:40,678
Dr. Shepherd.

112
00:04:40,731 --> 00:04:41,813
Is this Mr. McColl?

113
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:42,959
Yes, Blake. Why?

114
00:04:42,983 --> 00:04:44,382
The patient's
wife is downstairs.

115
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:45,845
Why are you telling me
this? Where's Edwards?

116
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:48,487
Dr. Webber mixed us up
today. I pulled your service.

117
00:04:48,555 --> 00:04:49,916
No. No?

118
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:51,817
No, where's the wife?
She's downstairs in admitting.

119
00:04:51,841 --> 00:04:52,974
Dr. Webber told me...

120
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:54,392
Tell Dr. Webber I said no.

121
00:04:59,316 --> 00:05:01,616
Wait. I'm in a
whole other bracket?

122
00:05:01,684 --> 00:05:02,951
Well, yes.

123
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:05,031
Your income has jumped
significantly since last year

124
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:06,888
and your husband's hasn't, so...

125
00:05:06,957 --> 00:05:08,340
Are those our taxes?

126
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:10,052
Hey, Chief, stop
harassing my patient.

127
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:12,304
Hey, people ask us for free
medical advice all the time.

128
00:05:12,328 --> 00:05:14,340
It's not harassment unless
I don't want to help her.

129
00:05:14,364 --> 00:05:18,066
I just had fetal surgery and I've
been stuck on bed rest for weeks.

130
00:05:18,134 --> 00:05:19,374
Which is actually pretty great

131
00:05:19,436 --> 00:05:20,813
if you're an accountant
during tax season.

132
00:05:20,837 --> 00:05:21,948
Nothing else to do but work.

133
00:05:21,972 --> 00:05:24,455
No distractions
except, well, for this.

134
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:28,059
See, I normally do our
taxes. It's sort of my thing.

135
00:05:28,112 --> 00:05:30,729
But, Courtney thinks that
maybe we should change...

136
00:05:30,798 --> 00:05:31,924
Hey, you.

137
00:05:31,948 --> 00:05:33,481
Out. You. Present.

138
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:35,545
You can't tell me what to do.

139
00:05:35,569 --> 00:05:36,668
Fine.

140
00:05:36,737 --> 00:05:38,837
I'll just... Yeah.

141
00:05:38,906 --> 00:05:39,946
Okay, I don't even...

142
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:41,389
Warren.

143
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:43,252
Oh. Sorry. Um, just
give me a minute to...

144
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:44,909
DeLuca.

145
00:05:44,978 --> 00:05:47,495
Okay, uh, Courtney
Hall, 23 weeks pregnant.

146
00:05:47,564 --> 00:05:49,876
She's post-op from a
fetal laser photocoagulation

147
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:53,168
to separate a shared blood
vessel between two of her babies.

148
00:05:53,237 --> 00:05:54,352
Wow, uh, quadruplets?

149
00:05:54,421 --> 00:05:56,215
Yeah. That's what I
said when I found out.

150
00:05:56,239 --> 00:05:57,833
Oh, good. You got
it. This is for you guys.

151
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,235
No, you did not need to do that.

152
00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:00,525
Yes, we did.

153
00:06:00,594 --> 00:06:02,505
You are the reason all
four of our little deductions

154
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:04,328
are still alive right now.

155
00:06:04,397 --> 00:06:06,130
Babies. She means babies.

156
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,249
You kept all four safe
inside where they belong.

157
00:06:08,318 --> 00:06:11,169
And I get to lie here for
eight more weeks. Yay!

158
00:06:11,238 --> 00:06:13,121
She means, "Thank you."

159
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:15,901
Fetal medicine has its perks.

160
00:06:18,594 --> 00:06:21,179
Surgery? Oh, God.

161
00:06:21,248 --> 00:06:23,292
Well, his heart rhythm
had become very erratic,

162
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:24,794
probably due to
the electrical shock,

163
00:06:24,818 --> 00:06:26,763
so I had to implant a pacemaker.

164
00:06:26,787 --> 00:06:28,153
Oh, no. Poor Griffin.

165
00:06:28,222 --> 00:06:30,499
The other concern is
Griffin suffered a brain bleed,

166
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:32,090
which I operated on.

167
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:33,859
A brain bleed?

168
00:06:33,927 --> 00:06:36,072
Your husband will be awake
soon, and we'll know more then.

169
00:06:36,096 --> 00:06:37,428
Oh, he's...

170
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:38,775
Well, Griffin's not
my husband. He's...

171
00:06:38,799 --> 00:06:40,732
Hello, Lena.

172
00:06:40,801 --> 00:06:41,867
How's my husband?

173
00:06:41,935 --> 00:06:45,252
I understand he's been
in a terrible accident.

174
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:47,305
I'm sorry. We
thought you were the...

175
00:06:47,357 --> 00:06:49,157
I am the wife.

176
00:06:49,226 --> 00:06:52,005
She's the slut he's
been hitting on the side.

177
00:06:52,029 --> 00:06:54,395
It's been 11 years, Gayle.

178
00:06:54,464 --> 00:06:56,464
How is Griffin? Is he dead?

179
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,484
His accident was severe.

180
00:06:59,553 --> 00:07:01,931
He needed surgery on
his heart and his brain...

181
00:07:01,955 --> 00:07:04,072
So, he's almost dead?

182
00:07:04,141 --> 00:07:05,885
We can take you to see him if...

183
00:07:05,909 --> 00:07:07,909
I don't want to see
him until he is dead.

184
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:13,565
So, first, we need to check on

185
00:07:13,634 --> 00:07:15,945
Kim Coley's baby's tracheal
balloon, and after that...

186
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:17,135
Warren. Go someplace else.

187
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:18,570
Why?

188
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,139
'Cause you're on my
service, and I said so.

189
00:07:22,476 --> 00:07:23,636
Hey. Hey.

190
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:24,826
How you feeling?

191
00:07:24,895 --> 00:07:26,135
Uh, good. How are you?

192
00:07:30,133 --> 00:07:31,249
How are you feeling?

193
00:07:31,318 --> 00:07:32,383
Fine.

194
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,219
Twelve weeks and fine.

195
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:35,853
Did you tell Jackson?

196
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:41,855
I'm worried that you're doing
this alone when you don't have to.

197
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:44,546
I'm not. I'm not
alone. I told you.

198
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:46,664
Okay.

199
00:07:48,235 --> 00:07:50,835
Okay, okay. So,
then, let's do this right.

200
00:07:50,903 --> 00:07:52,420
Let's get out in front of it.

201
00:07:52,488 --> 00:07:54,989
I think I'd like to start with
booking a 3-D ultrasound,

202
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:57,058
and then, I'd like
to run a genetic test

203
00:07:57,126 --> 00:07:59,311
to see if the fetus has
<i>osteogenesis imperfecta.</i>

204
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:00,812
No.

205
00:08:00,881 --> 00:08:02,013
April, I get it.

206
00:08:02,082 --> 00:08:03,359
With what you went
through last time,

207
00:08:03,383 --> 00:08:04,577
you don't want a
bunch of needles

208
00:08:04,601 --> 00:08:05,945
being stuck in your
belly... Arizona, I don't...

209
00:08:05,969 --> 00:08:07,447
But I can do a CVS,
and then if it's there,

210
00:08:07,471 --> 00:08:08,765
we'll see it and then
we'll just... We'll know.

211
00:08:08,789 --> 00:08:10,909
The baby's not getting tested.

212
00:08:11,592 --> 00:08:12,891
What?

213
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,675
Why?

214
00:08:15,845 --> 00:08:18,563
Because my baby will be fine.

215
00:08:36,717 --> 00:08:38,227
She said, "Because
my baby's fine!"

216
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:39,996
O.I. can be diagnosed early.

217
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,664
Why wouldn't she take
the test? That's crazy.

218
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:43,154
I know.

219
00:08:43,223 --> 00:08:45,156
Well, then Avery will
have to convince her.

220
00:08:45,225 --> 00:08:47,792
She won't tell him. I
don't know what to do.

221
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:49,973
Well, I'm not doing this.
I'm not lying to my friends.

222
00:08:49,997 --> 00:08:51,530
No one's asking you to...

223
00:08:51,598 --> 00:08:53,431
No one asking you to lie.

224
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,833
I say, "Pass me the coffee,"

225
00:08:54,902 --> 00:08:55,945
and I feel like
I'm lying to him.

226
00:08:55,969 --> 00:08:57,279
Well, then, we
need to talk to her.

227
00:08:57,303 --> 00:08:58,670
"We"?

228
00:08:58,739 --> 00:09:01,172
I didn't want to know about
this thing in the first place.

229
00:09:01,241 --> 00:09:03,775
Fine. I will talk to her.

230
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:10,215
So, what kind of surgeon is he?

231
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:11,716
Oncology.

232
00:09:11,785 --> 00:09:13,096
We can work with that.

233
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,854
Guessing 40s. Kind of tall.

234
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:17,400
And he's ranked in the military,

235
00:09:17,424 --> 00:09:19,457
so he has an authoritative side.

236
00:09:19,526 --> 00:09:20,642
I can hear you.

237
00:09:20,711 --> 00:09:22,071
But you can't hear
the phone ringing.

238
00:09:22,095 --> 00:09:23,138
Maybe her ringer's off.

239
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:24,862
It's not. Suctioning.

240
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:26,442
Sometimes your ringer is off,

241
00:09:26,466 --> 00:09:29,083
and it's been off for so long
that you forget that it's off,

242
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:31,414
and you need someone
to help you figure out

243
00:09:31,438 --> 00:09:33,082
how to turn it back
on. But once it's on...

244
00:09:33,106 --> 00:09:34,172
Oh.

245
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:35,940
Oh! That's it.

246
00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:37,687
Your ringer needs
to be turned on.

247
00:09:37,711 --> 00:09:39,154
You've been on
vibrate for too long.

248
00:09:39,178 --> 00:09:40,845
Ugh. Shut up.

249
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:44,349
If I answer, then
he'll ask me out.

250
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:47,338
And then I'll have to say no, and
there will be a lot of back and forth,

251
00:09:47,387 --> 00:09:48,797
and I won't know when
it's okay to hang up,

252
00:09:48,821 --> 00:09:50,121
so why answer?

253
00:09:51,658 --> 00:09:53,252
Dr. Grey, I saw all
your clinic patients.

254
00:09:53,276 --> 00:09:54,337
Can I scrub in?

255
00:09:54,361 --> 00:09:56,177
Did you drain
Mr. Kurtzman's wound?

256
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:57,912
No.

257
00:09:57,981 --> 00:09:59,441
Okay, Blake, well,
go get that done.

258
00:09:59,465 --> 00:10:00,748
Wilson.

259
00:10:00,817 --> 00:10:01,866
What?

260
00:10:03,236 --> 00:10:04,476
Forget it.

261
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:10,186
See? Now you're
mixing up your residents.

262
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:11,955
You need to get that ringer
turned on loud and fast.

263
00:10:11,979 --> 00:10:14,979
My ringer is fine.

264
00:10:15,048 --> 00:10:16,191
Are you almost done?

265
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:18,132
I have three more
returns to get through.

266
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:20,000
Don't bother her
during tax season.

267
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:21,602
It's the first rule.

268
00:10:21,671 --> 00:10:23,704
Should be done in just a second.

269
00:10:23,773 --> 00:10:26,458
Um, okay, there's baby A.

270
00:10:26,526 --> 00:10:28,193
Oh, there's baby B.

271
00:10:28,261 --> 00:10:29,339
Yeah.

272
00:10:29,363 --> 00:10:31,512
She's gonna be a
handful, right, hon?

273
00:10:31,581 --> 00:10:33,647
She's a kicker.

274
00:10:34,584 --> 00:10:37,885
And there's baby D. And...

275
00:10:43,877 --> 00:10:45,755
Go get Robbins, would you? Yeah.

276
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:47,194
What? What?

277
00:10:47,263 --> 00:10:50,247
Is something wrong?
Nothing. Nothing. It's, uh...

278
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:51,633
It's quadruplets, right?

279
00:10:51,701 --> 00:10:52,779
Yeah. Why?

280
00:10:52,803 --> 00:10:55,670
I'm just, uh... I'm looking,

281
00:10:55,739 --> 00:10:56,966
and, uh, it's probably
just me, but...

282
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,056
What?

283
00:11:00,043 --> 00:11:02,283
I can only find
three babies in here.

284
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:07,960
If I had known she
wasn't actually his wife...

285
00:11:07,984 --> 00:11:09,428
You should have known.
- You're right.

286
00:11:09,452 --> 00:11:10,796
You're absolutely
right. I just didn't...

287
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,665
Get your facts straight
before you let me

288
00:11:12,689 --> 00:11:14,500
go spilling medical
information to just anybody.

289
00:11:14,524 --> 00:11:15,934
You embarrassed me. I'm sorry.

290
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:17,458
She said that she was his...

291
00:11:17,527 --> 00:11:18,738
Why are you even here?
I said to tell Dr. Webber...

292
00:11:18,762 --> 00:11:19,762
Dr. Webber said that

293
00:11:19,829 --> 00:11:22,330
he chooses to
decline your proposal.

294
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,365
Well, then take the day off.

295
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:26,467
Dr. Webber rejected that, too.

296
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,649
Watch his monitors,
don't touch him,

297
00:11:29,673 --> 00:11:31,071
and stay out of my way.

298
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,568
The nurse will bring
up his personal things.

299
00:11:32,592 --> 00:11:34,086
These are patient
pamphlets on pacemakers.

300
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:37,345
Give it to the side piece.
She can change his diaper.

301
00:11:37,413 --> 00:11:38,957
I'm waiting for the funeral.

302
00:11:38,981 --> 00:11:40,414
Mrs. McColl, your husband...

303
00:11:40,483 --> 00:11:41,927
My husband, my
dear, was a sweet man

304
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,829
who turned into a
philandering bastard

305
00:11:43,853 --> 00:11:45,498
who only cared about his money,

306
00:11:45,522 --> 00:11:46,837
which I should have known

307
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:50,007
when he handed me that
prenup for my wedding present.

308
00:11:50,077 --> 00:11:52,510
That thing is as
tight as my Spanx.

309
00:11:52,578 --> 00:11:53,661
I see.

310
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:55,597
If he dies and we
are still married,

311
00:11:55,665 --> 00:11:58,933
I get his $30 million, which
is way less than I deserve

312
00:11:59,002 --> 00:12:00,785
for putting up with
that son of a bitch.

313
00:12:00,854 --> 00:12:02,820
But it'll have to do.

314
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:05,072
I'm waiting him out.

315
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:06,485
Well, I don't think we have to.

316
00:12:06,509 --> 00:12:08,159
He's 75 with a bum heart,

317
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:09,539
high blood pressure
and a cracked skull.

318
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:10,673
He probably won't even wake up.

319
00:12:10,697 --> 00:12:11,796
Right, Dr. Shepherd?

320
00:12:11,865 --> 00:12:13,025
We...

321
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:15,861
We're doing everything we can.

322
00:12:15,885 --> 00:12:17,485
You wouldn't screw
with me, would you?

323
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:18,937
Oh, Gayle, I wouldn't.

324
00:12:19,005 --> 00:12:21,022
There's not much
hope. So there's hope.

325
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:22,090
So if you want to just

326
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:24,091
sit right over here and wait...

327
00:12:26,029 --> 00:12:27,473
Why the hell... Oh, come on.

328
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:29,108
That's what she wanted
to hear. And it's refreshing.

329
00:12:29,132 --> 00:12:30,376
I mean, most family
members are like,

330
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,577
"Please, please, save him."

331
00:12:31,601 --> 00:12:34,035
I mean, this takes the
pressure off us a bit.

332
00:12:34,103 --> 00:12:35,765
Shepherd, I'm
kidding. That's dark.

333
00:12:35,789 --> 00:12:37,332
Yeah, sorry. Really
funny, though.

334
00:12:37,356 --> 00:12:39,034
Dr. Shepherd. What?

335
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:40,241
Mr. McColl's waking up.

336
00:12:41,561 --> 00:12:42,801
Ooh, I called that wrong.

337
00:12:45,398 --> 00:12:46,597
What...

338
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:48,232
Who the hell are you?

339
00:12:48,301 --> 00:12:49,366
Mr. McColl.

340
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:50,513
Griffin, it's me. It's Lena.

341
00:12:50,537 --> 00:12:52,231
You've been in a
pretty bad car wreck.

342
00:12:52,255 --> 00:12:53,421
You've had surgery...

343
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:54,805
Where's Gayle?

344
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:56,690
Gayle! Where's Gayle?

345
00:12:56,759 --> 00:12:57,892
Griffin, just relax, okay?

346
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,010
You need to calm down.

347
00:12:59,079 --> 00:13:01,378
Bugs! Help me. Bugs!

348
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:03,192
He's hallucinating.
Give him five of Haldol...

349
00:13:03,216 --> 00:13:04,448
Bugs!

350
00:13:05,885 --> 00:13:08,703
He's calling me. I'm Bugs.

351
00:13:08,771 --> 00:13:10,921
He hasn't called
me that in 30 years.

352
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,423
There you are.

353
00:13:12,492 --> 00:13:14,775
Bugs, come here.

354
00:13:16,112 --> 00:13:18,613
Bugs, come here. Come here.

355
00:13:22,669 --> 00:13:25,319
Honey, what's happening?

356
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:27,939
What... Just...

357
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:32,872
What happened? Where
would he have gone?

358
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:34,328
Nowhere. He's in here.

359
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:36,242
Dr. Warren's just a little
behind on his fetal medicine.

360
00:13:36,266 --> 00:13:37,960
- He's in here somewhere.
- Good.

361
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:39,945
We came in here with four
babies and we want to leave with...

362
00:13:39,969 --> 00:13:41,553
There! See, there he is. He's...

363
00:13:42,856 --> 00:13:44,088
Just moved down.

364
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:45,172
Why?

365
00:13:45,242 --> 00:13:47,342
To get away from his sisters?

366
00:13:48,678 --> 00:13:50,523
Courtney, I'm afraid
that you're in labor.

367
00:13:50,547 --> 00:13:52,012
No, I can't be. It's too soon.

368
00:13:52,082 --> 00:13:53,198
Months too soon.

369
00:13:53,266 --> 00:13:54,826
No, I can't have them
now. They'll all die.

370
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:55,883
I can't be in labor.

371
00:13:55,952 --> 00:13:57,802
I know. I know.

372
00:13:58,605 --> 00:13:59,725
But you are.

373
00:14:08,882 --> 00:14:11,348
Am I even having contractions?
I would notice, right?

374
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:12,661
When the babies are this small,

375
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,096
sometimes you don't
even feel the contractions.

376
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,798
Well, that's because she
shouldn't be having them.

377
00:14:15,822 --> 00:14:17,199
Are you sure you're not wrong?

378
00:14:17,223 --> 00:14:19,101
No, I'm not wrong. From
the position of baby C...

379
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:21,392
Charles. We're
calling him Charles.

380
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,728
Okay, Doug, we're
taking her into the OR.

381
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:25,207
In case something
happens, we'll be ready.

382
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:26,431
What? No one's coming today.

383
00:14:26,465 --> 00:14:27,977
Doug... No! It's too soon!

384
00:14:28,001 --> 00:14:29,517
They need more time, right?

385
00:14:29,586 --> 00:14:31,485
Please. Do something. I am.

386
00:14:31,554 --> 00:14:33,571
I can start her on
medication to stop the labor

387
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:35,668
and I can temporarily
sew her cervix closed,

388
00:14:35,692 --> 00:14:37,002
and that might
give us enough time.

389
00:14:37,026 --> 00:14:38,225
Might?

390
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:40,261
Labor's like a boulder
rolling down a hill.

391
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:41,640
Once it starts,
it's hard to stop.

392
00:14:41,664 --> 00:14:43,309
But you're stopping the boulder.

393
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:45,966
I am. I am trying
to stop the boulder.

394
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,412
He doesn't remember me at all?

395
00:14:58,481 --> 00:15:00,392
A brain injury of this nature,

396
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:03,345
it's not uncommon for some
memory loss to have occurred.

397
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:06,404
We've been together 11 years.

398
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:09,006
He wanted a divorce,
but she wouldn't...

399
00:15:10,944 --> 00:15:12,876
Can I talk to him?

400
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:15,162
Help him remember me?

401
00:15:15,231 --> 00:15:19,133
He's still confused
and agitated.

402
00:15:19,202 --> 00:15:21,102
He's asking for...

403
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,755
It's best if you wait out here.

404
00:15:28,128 --> 00:15:30,061
Her?

405
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:32,297
I took up with that lady? Why?

406
00:15:32,349 --> 00:15:35,177
Because you're a stupid
son of a bitch, that's why.

407
00:15:35,201 --> 00:15:36,451
Heart rate's looking good.

408
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:39,203
Wait, why would I take up
with her when I have you?

409
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:40,421
My wife.

410
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:43,774
You are the funniest. She is.

411
00:15:43,843 --> 00:15:45,860
She's the funniest
gal I've ever met.

412
00:15:45,928 --> 00:15:47,895
And you got the softest hands.

413
00:15:47,963 --> 00:15:50,414
It's soft as a rabbit's
foot I had when I was...

414
00:15:50,483 --> 00:15:51,816
Griffin. Stop.

415
00:15:51,885 --> 00:15:53,167
Go on. Feel them.

416
00:15:53,235 --> 00:15:54,902
I'll take your word for it.

417
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:57,554
Suit yourself.
You're missing out.

418
00:15:57,623 --> 00:16:00,458
What happened,
Bugs? What did I do?

419
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:03,160
Uh, we fought. A lot.

420
00:16:03,229 --> 00:16:04,462
About money.

421
00:16:04,531 --> 00:16:05,963
I don't care about money.

422
00:16:06,032 --> 00:16:08,165
Yeah, well, you
didn't when we met,

423
00:16:08,234 --> 00:16:11,235
but you've done
very well for yourself.

424
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:15,556
What did I do, Bugs?

425
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:17,107
Why would I ever hurt you?

426
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:19,743
Oh, I've been asking
you that for decades.

427
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:21,445
Dumbass.

428
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:25,783
It's like a time machine.

429
00:16:25,852 --> 00:16:27,885
I'm good here. You can go.

430
00:16:30,873 --> 00:16:32,072
And magnesium's up.

431
00:16:32,141 --> 00:16:33,608
Okay, Courtney. We're gonna wait

432
00:16:33,676 --> 00:16:35,710
and see if this medication
calms everybody down.

433
00:16:35,779 --> 00:16:37,055
And what do I do? Just lie here?

434
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:38,595
Yeah, and try to relax.

435
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,442
With four babies trying
to get over the wall?

436
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:41,860
And I still have 73 tax returns?

437
00:16:41,884 --> 00:16:43,618
Well, I said try.

438
00:16:47,624 --> 00:16:48,906
Contractions increasing.

439
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:54,662
Can I ask you something?

440
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:56,225
If a couple's been
married for three years,

441
00:16:56,249 --> 00:16:57,426
why not file jointly? Warren.

442
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:59,634
I'm just... No, no. It's okay.

443
00:16:59,702 --> 00:17:01,179
Well, that's not the problem.

444
00:17:01,203 --> 00:17:02,982
You guys have a pretty
significant earnings disparity.

445
00:17:03,006 --> 00:17:04,549
Well, I don't know if
I'd call it significant.

446
00:17:04,573 --> 00:17:06,391
It's more than 200%.

447
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:08,842
A little more than that.

448
00:17:08,911 --> 00:17:12,196
Her income increase is
raising your tax bill by a lot.

449
00:17:12,264 --> 00:17:14,031
This is relaxing me.

450
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,145
Honestly, she shouldn't
even be filing as an individual.

451
00:17:16,169 --> 00:17:17,846
She should incorporate.
Page Kepner.

452
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:20,821
Tell her to meet me in Exam
Room Five. I will be back.

453
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:23,019
Do not take your eyes
off of these monitors.

454
00:17:23,043 --> 00:17:25,287
If there is any change in any
of them, you get me back here.

455
00:17:25,311 --> 00:17:26,810
Okay.

456
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:29,575
Oh! There's another option. You
could both file as single individuals.

457
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:31,048
Well, how's that?

458
00:17:31,117 --> 00:17:31,916
You could do what some
of my clients have done.

459
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:33,112
You could get divorced.

460
00:17:33,136 --> 00:17:34,251
Why would we...

461
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,486
For the taxes.

462
00:17:38,141 --> 00:17:40,274
Grey still ignores me.

463
00:17:40,343 --> 00:17:42,176
Gross, gross, gross.

464
00:17:42,245 --> 00:17:44,073
She refuses to fill
me in on her patients.

465
00:17:44,097 --> 00:17:46,097
You can't restart Mrs.
Wheeler on tube feeds yet.

466
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:47,565
She had high
residuals last time.

467
00:17:47,634 --> 00:17:49,734
Crap. I thought her
ileus was resolved. Crap!

468
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:51,722
You know, this is urine.

469
00:17:51,771 --> 00:17:53,637
I've been urinated
on three times today.

470
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:55,100
What did you expect from babies?

471
00:17:55,124 --> 00:17:56,701
I'm talking about
puppies... Dogs.

472
00:17:56,725 --> 00:17:58,643
There are puppies
upstairs with the kids.

473
00:17:58,711 --> 00:18:00,595
Why aren't we up
there right now?

474
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:03,647
Because the only thing worse
than peds is peds with puppies

475
00:18:03,716 --> 00:18:06,216
because we're surgeons,
not veterinarians,

476
00:18:06,285 --> 00:18:07,629
because we should
not be urinated upon.

477
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:09,236
I'm being crapped on.

478
00:18:09,305 --> 00:18:11,350
You have to help me with
Shepherd. Shepherd wants me dead.

479
00:18:11,374 --> 00:18:12,807
At least she knows who you are.

480
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:14,292
Grey keeps calling me your name.

481
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,093
That doesn't even sound new.

482
00:18:16,162 --> 00:18:17,523
Being kicked out of bed was almost
better because then she would see me.

483
00:18:17,547 --> 00:18:18,763
Jo.

484
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:20,392
She'd have to see my
face to slam a door in it.

485
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:22,311
All right, you get 10
more seconds. What?

486
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:24,396
You get 10 seconds to
complain about Meredith Grey.

487
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:26,915
After that, you're done. No
more talking about it again, ever.

488
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:29,017
This is an excellent
plan. How is this fair?

489
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:31,592
You talk and you
talk about Grey,

490
00:18:31,661 --> 00:18:33,739
but you don't do anything
to change the situation.

491
00:18:33,763 --> 00:18:35,162
You get 10 seconds.

492
00:18:35,231 --> 00:18:37,276
After that, the only person you
can talk to about Meredith Grey

493
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,344
is Meredith Grey.

494
00:18:38,368 --> 00:18:39,411
I can't say it all
in 10 seconds.

495
00:18:39,435 --> 00:18:40,513
No, 'cause you have seven.

496
00:18:40,537 --> 00:18:42,003
What am I supposed
to say to her?

497
00:18:42,071 --> 00:18:43,249
She's the head of... Five.

498
00:18:43,273 --> 00:18:44,950
A friend would listen.
A friend would not...

499
00:18:44,974 --> 00:18:46,006
Time.

500
00:18:46,075 --> 00:18:47,174
Ugh!

501
00:18:47,243 --> 00:18:49,510
Never again.

502
00:18:49,579 --> 00:18:52,045
Can I just say
one more... Never.

503
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:55,611
Hey. I got your page.
What do you need?

504
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:57,868
Hey. Do you trust me?

505
00:18:57,937 --> 00:18:59,203
Arizona, I am swamped, and...

506
00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:01,116
I'm the only one that you
ever told, so do you trust me?

507
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,906
Yes, of course. I trust you.

508
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:05,336
I can feel the boulder starting
to roll, and I need to stop it.

509
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,689
So if you trust me,
then let me help you.

510
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:10,331
And you have to let
me help you my way.

511
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:12,545
Which means that you
need to tell Jackson.

512
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:15,080
And you need to let me
give you a full work-up.

513
00:19:15,104 --> 00:19:17,500
You're acting like I'm
not taking care of myself,

514
00:19:17,524 --> 00:19:19,189
but I am a doctor.

515
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:20,625
I'm not stupid.

516
00:19:20,693 --> 00:19:22,505
I'm just not interested
in getting certain tests.

517
00:19:22,529 --> 00:19:25,529
I don't want you going through
what you went through last time, April.

518
00:19:25,597 --> 00:19:26,942
I'm not worried about me. I am!

519
00:19:26,966 --> 00:19:28,932
And I am trying to help
you get what you want,

520
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:30,084
which is a healthy baby.

521
00:19:30,153 --> 00:19:32,197
One that's not gonna
go through horrible pain.

522
00:19:32,221 --> 00:19:33,520
Isn't that what you want?

523
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:35,567
Dr. Robbins. ARIZONA:
Not now, DeLuca.

524
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:37,872
Dr. Warren sent
me. It's Courtney.

525
00:19:41,196 --> 00:19:42,340
Oh, thank God you're back.

526
00:19:42,364 --> 00:19:43,625
You say her contractions
are more regular?

527
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:45,082
Yeah, and baby C is getting...

528
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:46,595
Charles. Charles is
showing recurrent decels.

529
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:48,197
Okay, Courtney.

530
00:19:48,221 --> 00:19:50,098
I think that Charles is still
trying to make a break for it.

531
00:19:50,122 --> 00:19:51,422
What? How do you know?

532
00:19:51,474 --> 00:19:52,674
Because I'm holding his feet.

533
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:03,479
How could she not know
she was birthing a baby?

534
00:20:03,503 --> 00:20:05,780
It's a quad at 23 weeks. He's
about the size of your hand.

535
00:20:05,804 --> 00:20:08,072
Quads. Going from
one litter to another.

536
00:20:08,141 --> 00:20:10,207
Peds is weird.

537
00:20:10,276 --> 00:20:11,653
We'll need at least two full NICU
teams down here for the transport.

538
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:12,677
Okay.

539
00:20:12,745 --> 00:20:13,889
I'm just saying.

540
00:20:13,913 --> 00:20:15,357
I have done our
taxes every year.

541
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:16,947
Why change it up now?

542
00:20:17,016 --> 00:20:19,461
There was never a reason until
now. Things changed this year.

543
00:20:19,485 --> 00:20:22,364
No, one thing changed this
year, Miranda. One thing. Your job!

544
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:23,804
It was a pretty big change.

545
00:20:23,873 --> 00:20:25,985
I need warmers and
neonatal resuscitation trays,

546
00:20:26,009 --> 00:20:27,769
and if you don't have
to be in here, get out.

547
00:20:27,793 --> 00:20:29,243
It's about to get crowded.

548
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,112
Hi, Courtney. My
name's Dr. Karev.

549
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:33,375
You're the out guy. We met
you during our tour of the NICU.

550
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:35,344
I am, and I can assure you,
we're gonna do everything...

551
00:20:35,368 --> 00:20:36,444
No, no, no. Don't
you talk to me.

552
00:20:36,468 --> 00:20:37,567
Dr. Robbins talks to me.

553
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:39,336
Dr. Robbins is the
in guy. She's the one.

554
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:42,439
These babies are staying
in. Dr. Robbins is in.

555
00:20:42,508 --> 00:20:44,291
You're keeping them in, right?

556
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,826
It's Charles, right?

557
00:20:45,895 --> 00:20:47,906
Courtney, Charles
already made up his mind.

558
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:49,758
He's partially out, and
once he's completely out,

559
00:20:49,782 --> 00:20:51,644
they all come out. Dr. Robbins.

560
00:20:51,668 --> 00:20:54,434
Promise me that
they're gonna survive,

561
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:55,631
that they'll live
once they're out.

562
00:20:55,655 --> 00:20:58,255
All four babies.

563
00:20:58,324 --> 00:20:59,751
I need four
umbilical line set-ups.

564
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:01,074
Warren. Wait.

565
00:21:04,564 --> 00:21:05,796
Just one.

566
00:21:05,864 --> 00:21:07,824
I'm sorry? I said
one set-up. Go!

567
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:09,511
What are you doing?

568
00:21:09,535 --> 00:21:11,786
I'm stopping the boulder!

569
00:21:17,993 --> 00:21:20,161
Heading up to check
on McColl's vitals.

570
00:21:20,229 --> 00:21:22,424
Make sure Blake's
watching monitors.

571
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:23,814
What is Blake's problem?

572
00:21:23,883 --> 00:21:25,349
What don't you like about her?

573
00:21:25,401 --> 00:21:27,951
She seems on top of it to
me, so what am I not seeing?

574
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:30,021
She's... No, she's...
I'm the new guy.

575
00:21:30,073 --> 00:21:32,707
So if she's the dead
fish, I'd like to know.

576
00:21:32,775 --> 00:21:35,342
It's personal
between her and me.

577
00:21:35,411 --> 00:21:37,306
You can form your
own conclusions.

578
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:40,364
Hmm. That's kind of you.
Must be nice for Blake.

579
00:21:40,433 --> 00:21:41,682
What does that mean?

580
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:43,050
Come on. You and Hunt

581
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:44,430
are obviously pretty tight.

582
00:21:44,454 --> 00:21:46,454
I'm sure you've formed
some conclusions about me.

583
00:21:51,343 --> 00:21:54,411
We should go to the steakhouse
we went to after our honeymoon.

584
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,375
That place isn't
even there anymore.

585
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:02,597
I'm sorry, guys. Can I get
in here a second, please?

586
00:22:02,621 --> 00:22:03,932
What's... Something wrong?

587
00:22:03,956 --> 00:22:05,033
Mr. McColl, can you
squeeze my hands

588
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:07,137
as hard as you can, okay?

589
00:22:10,546 --> 00:22:11,786
Follow the light.

590
00:22:11,847 --> 00:22:13,092
Blake, what is it?

591
00:22:13,116 --> 00:22:15,232
Page Shepherd immediately.
His ICP is climbing.

592
00:22:15,301 --> 00:22:17,001
He needs a
ventriculostomy, stat.

593
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:19,336
Start a ketamine drip
and grab an intubation kit.

594
00:22:19,405 --> 00:22:20,871
What is going on?

595
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:23,574
Ma'am, we are going to help
him, but I need you outside.

596
00:22:24,644 --> 00:22:25,971
Have you ever done
a ventriculostomy?

597
00:22:25,995 --> 00:22:27,756
Yes, but I'm not
supposed to touch him, so...

598
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,491
Can you do one? I'm not
supposed to touch him.

599
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:31,093
You're the neurosurgeon on call.

600
00:22:31,117 --> 00:22:33,162
Shepherd said no, so I'm not
gonna drill a hole in his head.

601
00:22:33,186 --> 00:22:34,379
Would you please just do it?

602
00:22:34,403 --> 00:22:36,114
You're running
out of time, Blake.

603
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:43,572
So I'm gonna deliver
Charles, I'm gonna stop labor,

604
00:22:43,596 --> 00:22:45,807
sew up the cervix, and then
leave the rest of the three inside

605
00:22:45,831 --> 00:22:47,059
for delayed delivery.

606
00:22:47,083 --> 00:22:48,582
That's impossible.

607
00:22:48,651 --> 00:22:50,500
Yes. Once Charles is out,

608
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:52,781
she'll keep having contractions
to deliver the placenta.

609
00:22:52,805 --> 00:22:54,299
They'll all deliver.
It's how it works.

610
00:22:54,323 --> 00:22:55,639
Okay, fine. Fine, great.

611
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:57,018
Then I don't deliver
Charles' placenta.

612
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:58,687
After I cut the
cord, I sterilize it.

613
00:22:58,711 --> 00:23:00,338
I put it back inside, and
we put Mom on antibiotics.

614
00:23:00,362 --> 00:23:02,196
Do you know how
dangerous that is?

615
00:23:02,265 --> 00:23:04,860
If that placenta stays in, it could
cause an infection, even sepsis.

616
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:06,528
It puts Mom at risk,
all three babies at...

617
00:23:06,552 --> 00:23:09,720
Alex, I am a fetal surgeon! I
know more about this than you do.

618
00:23:09,789 --> 00:23:11,883
I know exactly how they can
die. Have you done this before?

619
00:23:11,907 --> 00:23:13,440
Has Nicole Herman?

620
00:23:17,363 --> 00:23:19,897
No. I don't know
that anyone has.

621
00:23:19,966 --> 00:23:21,247
Robbins.

622
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:22,633
Please stop!

623
00:23:22,702 --> 00:23:24,346
Stop. I know that
you're gonna say no,

624
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:26,798
and I don't want to be in a
position where I go against you.

625
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:28,783
I know that this
is a judgment call,

626
00:23:28,807 --> 00:23:30,702
but your judgment
is not better here.

627
00:23:30,726 --> 00:23:32,092
I know what has to be done,

628
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,471
and this is the only way
that I know how to do it.

629
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:35,079
Okay, what I was going to say...

630
00:23:36,866 --> 00:23:38,115
Good luck.

631
00:23:42,004 --> 00:23:43,103
You're gonna let her...

632
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:46,273
I'm gonna let her do
what she's here to do.

633
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:48,622
And I suggest you do the same.

634
00:23:53,883 --> 00:23:54,943
What are you doing?

635
00:23:54,967 --> 00:23:56,233
His ICP was through the roof.

636
00:23:56,301 --> 00:23:57,467
Evidence of herniation.

637
00:23:57,536 --> 00:23:58,969
He needed a burr hole to...

638
00:23:59,037 --> 00:24:00,298
Relieve the pressure. Don't
tell me what a ventric is.

639
00:24:00,322 --> 00:24:01,399
Why would you let her do this?

640
00:24:01,423 --> 00:24:02,463
'Cause she caught it.

641
00:24:02,508 --> 00:24:03,524
And she could.

642
00:24:03,592 --> 00:24:05,426
Get out of my way.
Get away from him.

643
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:10,297
Ventriculostomy catheter.

644
00:24:15,288 --> 00:24:16,987
Did you prep for the EGD?

645
00:24:17,055 --> 00:24:19,134
No. I prepped for a colonoscopy.

646
00:24:19,158 --> 00:24:21,002
When you said scope,
I assumed that that's...

647
00:24:21,026 --> 00:24:23,994
But I don't need you
to assume anything.

648
00:24:24,062 --> 00:24:25,329
Never mind.

649
00:24:25,398 --> 00:24:27,209
Blake knew we were
checking for an upper G.I. bleed.

650
00:24:27,233 --> 00:24:29,265
It's just... I'm sorry.
Let me go and...

651
00:24:29,334 --> 00:24:30,734
It's fine. You're
just not Blake,

652
00:24:30,803 --> 00:24:34,538
and so let's prep for the EGD
and page me when we're ready.

653
00:24:35,774 --> 00:24:37,574
No. I'm not Blake.

654
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:39,793
I'm Wilson. Jo Wilson.

655
00:24:39,861 --> 00:24:43,463
Dr. Josephine Alice Wilson.
I'm a surgeon. I'm a human being.

656
00:24:43,532 --> 00:24:46,099
I'm not some stupid lump
that you can just kick around

657
00:24:46,185 --> 00:24:49,186
or talk down to or talk down
about or dismiss and discount.

658
00:24:49,254 --> 00:24:50,270
I get it.

659
00:24:50,339 --> 00:24:52,156
You don't like me, but I'm here.

660
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:53,864
I'm in Alex's life,
and I'm staying.

661
00:24:53,925 --> 00:24:55,792
And you have to
start respecting that.

662
00:24:55,862 --> 00:24:57,539
I don't know where
you're getting this.

663
00:24:57,563 --> 00:24:59,429
I'm trying to move
forward, okay? And I can't

664
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:02,499
because you're always around
the corner blocking my way,

665
00:25:02,568 --> 00:25:04,268
making everything so damn hard.

666
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:05,602
You are overreacting.

667
00:25:05,671 --> 00:25:07,204
No, I'm not.

668
00:25:07,273 --> 00:25:08,917
That's exactly what I'm
talking about. I'm done.

669
00:25:08,941 --> 00:25:10,457
I'm done with all of it.

670
00:25:10,543 --> 00:25:11,987
You know, call your
damn Army guy back

671
00:25:12,011 --> 00:25:13,777
and get your own boyfriend.

672
00:25:15,948 --> 00:25:17,564
Are you finished?

673
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:25,756
Oh, my...

674
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,524
Okay, are you ready?

675
00:25:33,548 --> 00:25:35,259
Just Charles? Just Charles.

676
00:25:35,283 --> 00:25:36,645
His sisters will just
have to deal with the fact

677
00:25:36,669 --> 00:25:37,812
that he wanted
to come out first.

678
00:25:37,836 --> 00:25:39,676
Typical boy. Okay. Okay.

679
00:25:40,406 --> 00:25:41,605
That's good.

680
00:25:41,674 --> 00:25:43,251
It's safer that way, right?
They get more time?

681
00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:44,686
Courtney, I need you to hold on

682
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:46,254
for a little bit longer, okay?

683
00:25:46,278 --> 00:25:47,789
I need you to trust me. Can
you do that? Can you trust me?

684
00:25:47,813 --> 00:25:50,013
I'm sorry. It's just...
Can Doug be in here?

685
00:25:50,082 --> 00:25:51,510
We had always talked
about the delivery and...

686
00:25:51,534 --> 00:25:53,895
No, we can't risk any additional
bacteria during the procedure.

687
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:56,620
It's just too dangerous
for you and for the babies.

688
00:25:56,689 --> 00:25:58,522
Okay.

689
00:26:02,494 --> 00:26:04,094
Warren. Can you...

690
00:26:05,364 --> 00:26:07,164
Absolutely.

691
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,476
Don't forget that you need to...

692
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,267
Eyes on monitors.

693
00:26:10,335 --> 00:26:11,613
Okay. All right.

694
00:26:11,637 --> 00:26:12,877
Okay, Courtney.

695
00:26:12,939 --> 00:26:16,056
I just need the tiniest
little push. Okay, ready?

696
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:21,762
Okay, good. Good,
good, good. Okay.

697
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:22,879
Okay, clamp.

698
00:26:25,618 --> 00:26:27,378
Karev. ALEX: Right here.

699
00:26:29,121 --> 00:26:30,788
Okay. Okay.

700
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:33,702
All right. What's happening?

701
00:26:33,726 --> 00:26:35,237
Everything's happening
exactly like it should.

702
00:26:35,261 --> 00:26:37,077
You just breathe.

703
00:26:37,145 --> 00:26:38,278
Okay. Okay.

704
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,699
Here we go.

705
00:26:42,768 --> 00:26:44,846
His CT showed he's
having a re-bleed.

706
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:46,236
I will operate,

707
00:26:46,305 --> 00:26:48,872
but the fact that
it's bleeding again...

708
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:51,208
It's not good.

709
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:53,310
And when he wakes up,
will he be the same, or...

710
00:26:53,378 --> 00:26:56,112
Will you please go away?

711
00:26:56,181 --> 00:26:58,081
This is between
me and my husband.

712
00:26:59,018 --> 00:27:00,551
So please go.

713
00:27:09,761 --> 00:27:11,161
Will he be the same?

714
00:27:12,647 --> 00:27:13,976
There's just no way of knowing.

715
00:27:16,985 --> 00:27:18,718
I just got him back.

716
00:27:20,356 --> 00:27:23,957
I lost 33 years
with that old jerk.

717
00:27:27,096 --> 00:27:30,180
Only a man that I
could love that much

718
00:27:30,248 --> 00:27:32,448
would make me feel so angry.

719
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:36,953
I just want him back. I just...

720
00:27:38,524 --> 00:27:41,057
I just want to have the chance

721
00:27:41,126 --> 00:27:44,127
to love him again.

722
00:27:52,121 --> 00:27:54,238
Blake, find Edwards

723
00:27:54,306 --> 00:27:56,940
and tell her to
meet me in OR One.

724
00:27:57,009 --> 00:27:59,159
Yeah.

725
00:27:59,228 --> 00:28:01,772
Shepherd, you don't have time to
go chasing around after Edwards.

726
00:28:01,796 --> 00:28:04,236
You need to be in there now.

727
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:07,084
Blake.

728
00:28:08,237 --> 00:28:09,436
Wait.

729
00:28:16,895 --> 00:28:19,246
No significant post-op
changes. That's good.

730
00:28:19,314 --> 00:28:20,413
Yeah.

731
00:28:21,851 --> 00:28:23,462
He's called how many times now?

732
00:28:23,486 --> 00:28:24,996
Oh, God. Just give me the phone.

733
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:27,082
I'll send him a nice
blow-off text. No, not a text.

734
00:28:27,106 --> 00:28:28,488
She is not a monster.

735
00:28:28,557 --> 00:28:30,135
But Callie's right,
Mer. We need a plan.

736
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:31,675
We don't need anything.

737
00:28:31,744 --> 00:28:33,388
God, between you and Wilson...

738
00:28:33,412 --> 00:28:35,094
What about Wilson?

739
00:28:35,163 --> 00:28:36,624
Oh, she just tore into me
about how I treat her like crap.

740
00:28:36,648 --> 00:28:38,014
She really lost it.

741
00:28:39,685 --> 00:28:40,850
What?

742
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:44,137
You... You kind of
treat Wilson like a...

743
00:28:44,206 --> 00:28:46,139
Like... Callie. Like a gnat.

744
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:48,174
Yeah. You swat her.

745
00:28:48,243 --> 00:28:50,655
Well, that's what we do to
residents. I've seen you guys swat.

746
00:28:50,679 --> 00:28:53,430
We're all hard on
residents. We swat.

747
00:28:53,498 --> 00:28:55,299
Yeah, but we like them.

748
00:28:56,101 --> 00:28:57,181
Yeah, I like Wilson.

749
00:28:58,670 --> 00:28:59,936
Do you?

750
00:29:06,778 --> 00:29:08,212
Suction.

751
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,614
There's too much swelling.

752
00:29:10,683 --> 00:29:12,043
I want to talk you through it.

753
00:29:12,067 --> 00:29:13,395
I want to tell you
what I did and why.

754
00:29:13,419 --> 00:29:15,129
Blake, I don't need
your excuses now.

755
00:29:15,153 --> 00:29:17,888
It's not for me. It's for you.

756
00:29:17,956 --> 00:29:20,218
I think you'd like to know what
happens when you're not here.

757
00:29:20,242 --> 00:29:21,482
Edwards says you like that.

758
00:29:21,526 --> 00:29:23,243
Just... Suction.

759
00:29:26,215 --> 00:29:27,976
I was tracking his vitals.

760
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,344
He was bradying down slowly
and becoming hypotensive.

761
00:29:30,368 --> 00:29:31,718
He had a dilated pupil.

762
00:29:31,787 --> 00:29:34,232
All classic signs of raised
intracranial pressure.

763
00:29:34,256 --> 00:29:36,100
I knew that he
needed the ventric,

764
00:29:36,124 --> 00:29:37,669
so I asked Dr. Riggs
to prepare it.

765
00:29:37,693 --> 00:29:40,005
He thought I was qualified.
I knew I was qualified.

766
00:29:40,029 --> 00:29:41,061
Suction. More.

767
00:29:43,999 --> 00:29:44,999
Then what?

768
00:29:49,989 --> 00:29:53,149
I used your craniometric
method for the drilling site,

769
00:29:54,393 --> 00:29:55,842
prepared it adequately.

770
00:29:55,911 --> 00:29:58,478
I identified Kocher's point
at 11 centimeters, then...

771
00:29:58,547 --> 00:29:59,946
All right, Betadine.

772
00:30:01,383 --> 00:30:03,195
More. Just pour the
entire bottle on the cord.

773
00:30:03,219 --> 00:30:04,496
Karev, how are we
doing back there?

774
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,713
APGAR score is 3.

775
00:30:05,737 --> 00:30:06,986
I need a smaller tube.

776
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:08,466
- That's a three.
- Then get me a two.

777
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:09,800
- Alex!
- Give me a minute!

778
00:30:09,824 --> 00:30:11,441
Endoloops. Is Charles okay?

779
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:12,653
Dr. Karev is just trying

780
00:30:12,677 --> 00:30:13,922
to get some air into his lungs.

781
00:30:13,946 --> 00:30:15,357
She's still having contractions.

782
00:30:15,381 --> 00:30:17,548
Okay, uh, increase
the magnesium rate.

783
00:30:17,616 --> 00:30:19,410
You know what?
Uh, I'm still confused.

784
00:30:19,434 --> 00:30:21,112
Take me through
the deductions again.

785
00:30:21,136 --> 00:30:22,685
Um, okay.

786
00:30:22,738 --> 00:30:24,666
First, the obvious. Do
you have any dependents?

787
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:26,072
We do. We do.

788
00:30:26,141 --> 00:30:27,991
One. A son.

789
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:29,325
Me, too.

790
00:30:29,394 --> 00:30:31,061
I have a son now, too.

791
00:30:36,702 --> 00:30:38,601
You're just packing.

792
00:30:38,671 --> 00:30:39,714
Should we resuscitate?

793
00:30:39,738 --> 00:30:40,771
No.

794
00:30:42,141 --> 00:30:43,141
He's gone.

795
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:46,126
He herniated.

796
00:30:47,295 --> 00:30:49,129
He was brain-dead minutes ago.

797
00:30:51,316 --> 00:30:53,884
Time of death, 18:09.

798
00:30:58,223 --> 00:30:59,463
Did I...

799
00:31:01,459 --> 00:31:03,539
Was it what I... No.

800
00:31:04,763 --> 00:31:05,829
No.

801
00:31:07,298 --> 00:31:08,348
You were perfect.

802
00:31:32,625 --> 00:31:33,825
He didn't make it.

803
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,727
Should I find Gayle?

804
00:31:36,795 --> 00:31:38,979
No, I will. NATHAN: No, I'll go.

805
00:31:39,047 --> 00:31:40,642
I mean, you have plans, right?

806
00:31:40,666 --> 00:31:42,933
I'll tell her.

807
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:44,921
But thank you. Yeah, no worries.

808
00:31:45,487 --> 00:31:46,887
Let's go, Blake.

809
00:31:53,645 --> 00:31:54,911
Is he stable?

810
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:57,680
A little hypotensive,
but oxygenating well,

811
00:31:57,749 --> 00:31:59,627
which is something
for his size, so...

812
00:31:59,651 --> 00:32:01,084
So we got all four.

813
00:32:01,153 --> 00:32:02,363
You got all four.

814
00:32:02,387 --> 00:32:04,220
Thank God.

815
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:05,888
How's Courtney?

816
00:32:05,958 --> 00:32:09,909
She's stable. She's back in her
room with three fetal heartbeats.

817
00:32:09,978 --> 00:32:12,018
It'll be day-to-day to
see if it works, but...

818
00:32:12,064 --> 00:32:15,176
Well, even just a day or two
more inside will help the other three.

819
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,766
Yeah.

820
00:32:16,835 --> 00:32:19,647
Look, you know I didn't
agree with the whole thing.

821
00:32:19,671 --> 00:32:20,982
I didn't think it
would work, but...

822
00:32:21,006 --> 00:32:22,422
Mmm, Karev.

823
00:32:22,491 --> 00:32:24,507
Are you trying to give
me a compliment?

824
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:27,339
I'm saying no one else
could have done what you did.

825
00:32:30,432 --> 00:32:31,714
Did you talk to Kepner?

826
00:32:31,784 --> 00:32:33,116
I tried.

827
00:32:33,185 --> 00:32:35,451
I just... I don't think
that she hears me.

828
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,320
We...

829
00:32:37,389 --> 00:32:38,638
We have to do something.

830
00:32:38,707 --> 00:32:39,922
Yeah. I know.

831
00:32:41,693 --> 00:32:43,409
Hi! Dr. Robbins?

832
00:32:43,478 --> 00:32:45,094
You ready to meet your son?

833
00:32:45,564 --> 00:32:46,796
Yeah.

834
00:32:48,233 --> 00:32:49,832
Here we go, hon.

835
00:32:54,005 --> 00:32:55,639
There he is.

836
00:32:57,609 --> 00:32:58,825
<i>Hi!</i>

837
00:33:00,462 --> 00:33:01,582
<i>Hi, baby.</i>

838
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:05,532
He's so beautiful! Hi!

839
00:33:06,568 --> 00:33:07,808
Hi, baby.

840
00:33:08,536 --> 00:33:11,238
<i>Hi! Hi!</i>

841
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:14,391
<i>Hi!</i>

842
00:33:15,894 --> 00:33:17,577
You paged?

843
00:33:17,645 --> 00:33:21,647
Um, Robbins has
requested you for her service

844
00:33:21,716 --> 00:33:23,383
for the foreseeable future.

845
00:33:23,452 --> 00:33:25,597
Apparently, you're really
good with the moms.

846
00:33:25,621 --> 00:33:28,789
Yeah, I'm not. I just
did what Robbins...

847
00:33:28,857 --> 00:33:31,574
No, you helped that woman

848
00:33:31,643 --> 00:33:34,077
through the scariest
hours of her life.

849
00:33:34,979 --> 00:33:36,124
I did, didn't I?

850
00:33:36,148 --> 00:33:37,647
Yes, you did.

851
00:33:37,716 --> 00:33:39,699
And you got us a new accountant.

852
00:33:39,768 --> 00:33:40,879
Wait, what?

853
00:33:40,903 --> 00:33:43,786
I hired Courtney to
do our taxes for us.

854
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:45,856
'Cause, you know, so
many things have changed,

855
00:33:45,924 --> 00:33:48,458
and, um, we're
both so busy and...

856
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:50,009
Well, you're a resident, and...

857
00:33:50,078 --> 00:33:51,318
And you're the Chief.

858
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:52,863
I am.

859
00:33:53,965 --> 00:33:55,799
Are you okay with that?

860
00:33:56,601 --> 00:33:57,717
I just...

861
00:33:58,186 --> 00:33:59,552
Uh...

862
00:33:59,621 --> 00:34:02,205
It's just less work for
you, I was thinking.

863
00:34:03,158 --> 00:34:04,407
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

864
00:34:04,475 --> 00:34:05,475
Okay.

865
00:34:09,164 --> 00:34:11,130
So I'm just gonna go
finish Robbins' rounds.

866
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:12,282
Okay.

867
00:34:14,736 --> 00:34:16,656
See you at home?
Yeah, see you at home.

868
00:34:23,762 --> 00:34:25,506
I'm sorry. What
are we doing here?

869
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:26,996
You got to tell him.

870
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:28,798
If he figures it out,
sooner or later...

871
00:34:28,867 --> 00:34:30,411
Look, he's gonna hear
it from someone else.

872
00:34:30,435 --> 00:34:31,701
Uh-huh.

873
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:33,803
Look, I'm just saying
the longer you wait,

874
00:34:33,872 --> 00:34:35,583
the worse it's gonna
be. Mmm-hmm.

875
00:34:35,607 --> 00:34:37,607
And you got to
listen to Robbins.

876
00:34:37,675 --> 00:34:39,309
Wow, you and Arizona, you...

877
00:34:39,378 --> 00:34:40,504
You're a great team.

878
00:34:40,528 --> 00:34:41,828
Well, we just want...

879
00:34:41,897 --> 00:34:44,314
No, it's sweet.

880
00:34:44,382 --> 00:34:48,918
Thank you. Really.
You're so invested.

881
00:34:48,987 --> 00:34:51,031
You're like the Supreme Court

882
00:34:51,055 --> 00:34:53,450
just trying to tell a woman
what she can and can't do.

883
00:34:53,474 --> 00:34:54,752
I don't want to see
you guys get hurt again.

884
00:34:54,776 --> 00:34:56,476
Well, neither do I!

885
00:34:59,681 --> 00:35:03,082
I'm not telling him because
we have been through enough.

886
00:35:03,151 --> 00:35:05,251
Especially him.

887
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,964
Because he never
got over the last one.

888
00:35:06,988 --> 00:35:08,799
He never had the chance
to, and I am hanging on

889
00:35:08,823 --> 00:35:10,834
to every last
shred of faith I have

890
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:13,104
that this time, it'll be okay.

891
00:35:13,128 --> 00:35:15,161
But he doesn't have that.

892
00:35:16,631 --> 00:35:19,849
So it'll just be better
if he doesn't know yet.

893
00:35:19,918 --> 00:35:21,801
It won't. You're
making it worse.

894
00:35:32,197 --> 00:35:33,763
You're right.

895
00:35:35,267 --> 00:35:36,683
I am hard on you.

896
00:35:38,236 --> 00:35:40,120
Alex hasn't had it easy.

897
00:35:40,188 --> 00:35:43,673
Everyone he's ever been with
has run away or stolen his job

898
00:35:43,741 --> 00:35:45,708
or gone crazy or
broken his heart.

899
00:35:45,777 --> 00:35:47,144
None of them stick.

900
00:35:47,212 --> 00:35:49,028
And he doesn't deserve
to take another hit.

901
00:35:50,449 --> 00:35:53,133
But the point is, I am sorry

902
00:35:53,201 --> 00:35:57,670
for squashing you like a
bug or whatever it is that I do.

903
00:36:00,442 --> 00:36:01,824
Thank you.

904
00:36:02,961 --> 00:36:05,912
But, you know, you
are what you allow.

905
00:36:05,981 --> 00:36:08,192
And if you let them pluck off
your shiny little insect wings,

906
00:36:08,216 --> 00:36:09,216
they will.

907
00:36:10,518 --> 00:36:11,518
Um...

908
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:13,319
Okay.

909
00:36:13,388 --> 00:36:15,588
So don't let them. Don't let me.

910
00:36:18,627 --> 00:36:19,627
Understood?

911
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,345
Yeah.

912
00:36:24,132 --> 00:36:27,333
And for the record, Wilson,

913
00:36:27,402 --> 00:36:28,852
I am rooting for you to stick.

914
00:36:36,995 --> 00:36:39,129
Hey. Are we not going?

915
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:40,397
I'm sorry.

916
00:36:40,465 --> 00:36:42,999
I have not had a
chance to change. Um...

917
00:36:44,169 --> 00:36:45,849
This day. Ah.

918
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:48,538
We're canceling.

919
00:36:48,607 --> 00:36:49,872
No. No. I...

920
00:36:51,476 --> 00:36:53,636
I just... I lost a patient.

921
00:36:53,978 --> 00:36:55,639
And his wife lost him, too.

922
00:36:55,663 --> 00:36:57,380
Was it Riggs? Did
he do something...

923
00:36:57,448 --> 00:36:59,015
No.

924
00:36:59,084 --> 00:37:01,584
No, Riggs was great.

925
00:37:01,652 --> 00:37:03,772
I can see why you liked him.

926
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:07,189
It was Blake.

927
00:37:07,259 --> 00:37:08,641
Blake lost your patient?

928
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:10,477
Not at all.

929
00:37:10,545 --> 00:37:14,180
Blake has microscope hands,

930
00:37:15,417 --> 00:37:17,583
a level head,

931
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:20,972
more assured in the OR than
any resident I have ever seen.

932
00:37:22,256 --> 00:37:24,656
She's a natural neurosurgeon.

933
00:37:25,544 --> 00:37:27,984
And now I have to teach her.

934
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:32,565
I owe it to her, to teach her.

935
00:37:38,105 --> 00:37:39,688
Dinner's off.

936
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:41,524
No. No. Owen, I can rally.

937
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:43,260
No. No. It is off.

938
00:37:43,929 --> 00:37:45,261
Come with me.

939
00:37:48,816 --> 00:37:50,183
Come on.

940
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:57,068
You know, I don't
really like surprises.

941
00:37:57,092 --> 00:37:58,491
You'll like this one.

942
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,338
Excuse me, can we get five
minutes before you leave?

943
00:38:00,362 --> 00:38:02,373
Yeah. Five minutes?
For what, exactly?

944
00:38:02,397 --> 00:38:04,197
Come on. Let's go.

945
00:38:05,817 --> 00:38:07,817
Studies have shown
that petting a dog

946
00:38:07,886 --> 00:38:09,802
can actually lower
blood pressure.

947
00:38:09,871 --> 00:38:11,198
Owen.

948
00:38:11,222 --> 00:38:14,824
And they make a really
crappy day a lot less crappy.

949
00:38:17,679 --> 00:38:19,045
Oh...

950
00:38:19,114 --> 00:38:21,397
Oh...

951
00:38:32,493 --> 00:38:33,826
<i>Affection,</i>

952
00:38:34,596 --> 00:38:36,362
<i>acceptance</i>

953
00:38:36,431 --> 00:38:38,381
<i>and unconditional love.</i>

954
00:38:58,486 --> 00:39:00,704
<i>We all want it.</i>

955
00:39:00,772 --> 00:39:01,871
<i>We all look for it.</i>

956
00:39:07,645 --> 00:39:08,845
Nice night.

957
00:39:13,452 --> 00:39:15,568
See, right about now,

958
00:39:15,637 --> 00:39:18,187
you're thinking I'm
some kind of stalker.

959
00:39:20,708 --> 00:39:23,776
Yeah, I've called.
And I've texted.

960
00:39:23,845 --> 00:39:26,345
Because I wanted
to see you again.

961
00:39:26,414 --> 00:39:28,454
And I thought I'd ask
you out, but I can't do that

962
00:39:28,516 --> 00:39:30,076
if you don't call me back.

963
00:39:42,047 --> 00:39:46,015
I thought I'd show
up here, ask you.

964
00:39:46,083 --> 00:39:47,728
That way, if you
wanted to turn me down,

965
00:39:47,752 --> 00:39:49,869
you'd have to do it in person.

966
00:39:49,938 --> 00:39:52,672
Looking at my very nice
face makes it hard to say no.

967
00:39:55,593 --> 00:39:58,094
So, what do you say, Dr. Grey?

968
00:40:00,765 --> 00:40:03,065
Would you like
to go out with me?

969
00:40:03,134 --> 00:40:04,854
<i>But when we find it...</i>

970
00:40:10,892 --> 00:40:12,992
<i>It's flat-out terrifying.</i>

971
00:40:13,061 --> 00:40:14,672
Um, have you seen Dr. Avery?

972
00:40:14,696 --> 00:40:16,012
Upstairs in the lab.

973
00:40:22,087 --> 00:40:24,604
<i>Because just as quickly
as we may have found it,</i>

974
00:40:27,976 --> 00:40:29,709
<i>it can disappear.</i>

975
00:40:29,778 --> 00:40:31,177
Jackson, can we...

976
00:40:37,702 --> 00:40:39,952
<i>And we're back
out there in the cold.</i>

977
00:40:40,021 --> 00:40:41,541
Why is she telling me this?

978
00:40:42,157 --> 00:40:43,157
Oh...

979
00:40:44,192 --> 00:40:45,374
<i>Alone.</i>
