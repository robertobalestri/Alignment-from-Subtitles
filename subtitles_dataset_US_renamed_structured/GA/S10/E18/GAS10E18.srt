1
00:00:06,073 --> 00:00:07,713
<i>Do you know who you are?</i>

2
00:00:10,478 --> 00:00:12,944
<i>Do you know what's
happened to you?</i>

3
00:00:17,084 --> 00:00:19,718
<i>Do you want to live this way?</i>

4
00:00:22,139 --> 00:00:23,566
There's a hole in
the pericardium.

5
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:25,318
That's the source
of all this blood?

6
00:00:25,342 --> 00:00:27,509
No, that's what's
keeping him alive.

7
00:00:31,499 --> 00:00:33,081
Well, hello.

8
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:37,418
<i>All it takes is one person,
one patient, one moment,</i>

9
00:00:37,487 --> 00:00:39,320
<i>to change your life forever.</i>

10
00:00:39,389 --> 00:00:40,867
You're stopping.
Why're you stopping?

11
00:00:40,891 --> 00:00:43,875
Ross, I would like
to introduce you to

12
00:00:43,944 --> 00:00:45,477
the black mamba.

13
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:49,081
<i>It can change your
perspective, color your thinking...</i>

14
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:51,316
Um, isn't that the IVC?

15
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:54,653
The single trickiest vessel
in the entire human body.

16
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:57,505
Delicate, unpredictable.

17
00:00:57,574 --> 00:01:00,325
Hear that? The
gurgling? That's its song.

18
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:02,211
See that? Look how it twitches.

19
00:01:02,279 --> 00:01:06,048
One wrong move, one
misstep, and this patient is dead.

20
00:01:06,116 --> 00:01:10,068
You can't repair that
mamba without moving

21
00:01:10,137 --> 00:01:11,748
with the mamba.

22
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:13,972
Some people say it's
impossible to repair.

23
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:15,540
<i>One moment that forces you</i>

24
00:01:15,609 --> 00:01:18,060
<i>to re-evaluate everything
you think you know.</i>

25
00:01:18,145 --> 00:01:19,611
Come on, mamba.

26
00:01:19,679 --> 00:01:20,979
Let's dance.

27
00:01:24,218 --> 00:01:25,244
You paged?

28
00:01:25,268 --> 00:01:26,601
MVC victim.

29
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:29,471
Wanted you to take a
look at the C-spine X-rays.

30
00:01:30,357 --> 00:01:32,374
Oh, damn. Poor guy.

31
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,993
<i>One tiny thing that
makes you ask yourself</i>

32
00:01:35,062 --> 00:01:37,162
<i>the really tough
questions like...</i>

33
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:40,649
Oh, yes! And that's
how you do the dance.

34
00:01:40,717 --> 00:01:43,819
Ross, see that? Did
you see how I managed...

35
00:01:43,887 --> 00:01:45,386
Oh, hey!

36
00:01:46,323 --> 00:01:47,388
I just nailed the mamba.

37
00:01:47,457 --> 00:01:48,724
<i>Do you know who you are?</i>

38
00:01:48,809 --> 00:01:50,787
The patient's C3
and 4 are obliterated.

39
00:01:50,811 --> 00:01:51,888
His spinal cord is severed.

40
00:01:51,912 --> 00:01:54,152
There's no way
I can repair that.

41
00:01:54,998 --> 00:01:57,076
<i>Do you know what's
happened to you?</i>

42
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,678
But we just fixed his heart.

43
00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:01,119
Against all odds.
'Cause I'm awesome.

44
00:02:01,188 --> 00:02:02,670
Yeah, well, even so,

45
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:04,934
he's lost all motor function
from the neck down.

46
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,258
The man's paralyzed.

47
00:02:09,813 --> 00:02:11,591
<i>Do you want to live this way?</i>

48
00:02:15,085 --> 00:02:16,768
<i>Wait, what?</i>

49
00:02:16,837 --> 00:02:21,072
Unfortunately, the impact of the
crash severed his spinal cord at C3,

50
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,619
which is quite
high in the neck...

51
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:24,621
Yeah, no, I'm a nurse.
I know what C3 is.

52
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:26,812
So you're saying...

53
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,960
He's paralyzed?

54
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:30,849
Yes.

55
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:32,267
I am so sorry.

56
00:02:32,336 --> 00:02:34,669
But his brain function is good,

57
00:02:34,738 --> 00:02:36,971
and I was able to
fully repair his heart.

58
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,009
Is his diaphragm working?
Can he breathe on his own?

59
00:02:41,078 --> 00:02:43,678
No, he's currently
on a ventilator.

60
00:02:43,747 --> 00:02:47,916
There are options from here,
once he's had time to recover,

61
00:02:47,984 --> 00:02:50,519
surgery to fuse his
spine so he can sit up.

62
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:53,522
We can insert a permanent trach.

63
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,018
These are all options
we can discuss...

64
00:02:55,042 --> 00:02:57,402
Will he ever breathe
on his own again?

65
00:02:58,462 --> 00:03:00,729
No. He will not.

66
00:03:00,798 --> 00:03:03,181
Okay, um...

67
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:06,184
I need you to wake
him up right now.

68
00:03:06,253 --> 00:03:07,446
You can do that, right?

69
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:09,830
Elise, your husband just
underwent major surgery.

70
00:03:09,873 --> 00:03:12,819
I know, and now I'm
asking you to wake him up.

71
00:03:12,843 --> 00:03:16,661
And I need you to ask him if
he wants you to remove the vent.

72
00:03:17,781 --> 00:03:19,091
Well, the vent is
breathing for him.

73
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:20,582
It's what's keeping him alive.

74
00:03:20,651 --> 00:03:23,396
I was gonna
surprise him tonight.

75
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:25,131
As an early anniversary gift,

76
00:03:25,155 --> 00:03:27,022
I got us playoff tickets.

77
00:03:27,091 --> 00:03:29,569
I mean, nosebleed seats,
but we kind of love it up there.

78
00:03:29,593 --> 00:03:32,110
It's like, pretzels and
hot dogs for dinner.

79
00:03:32,179 --> 00:03:35,530
I mean, it's fun.

80
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:39,584
The last thing I thought
when I woke up this morning

81
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:41,770
was I'd lose Jason.

82
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:47,024
I understand what I'm asking.

83
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:50,512
Believe me, I don't
want to lose him.

84
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:53,048
But...

85
00:03:53,117 --> 00:03:56,468
I know him. I know
everything about him.

86
00:03:56,536 --> 00:03:59,171
I understand how he
thinks. I get his humor.

87
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,584
I could predict what he's
gonna order in a restaurant.

88
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:06,128
And I just... I don't
think he would want this.

89
00:04:06,196 --> 00:04:08,563
I know it.

90
00:04:08,632 --> 00:04:10,744
I think he would rather die

91
00:04:10,768 --> 00:04:13,601
than live one more minute
hooked up to a machine.

92
00:04:18,808 --> 00:04:20,742
It's your husband's
right to decline treatment,

93
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:22,977
if that's what he wants.

94
00:04:23,947 --> 00:04:25,313
It'll take some time

95
00:04:25,382 --> 00:04:27,416
to fully wean him
off the sedation,

96
00:04:27,484 --> 00:04:30,735
but I'll let you know
when he starts to wake.

97
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:33,688
Thank you.

98
00:04:33,757 --> 00:04:35,157
I think she really means it.

99
00:04:35,225 --> 00:04:36,569
And that bugs you?

100
00:04:36,593 --> 00:04:38,727
No. I mean, maybe. I don't know.

101
00:04:38,795 --> 00:04:40,695
It's just... I don't know.

102
00:04:40,764 --> 00:04:43,832
It's not like I want to get
married tomorrow, but never?

103
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:46,101
But you're with her.

104
00:04:46,169 --> 00:04:48,465
If you love her, who cares if
she's not the marrying kind?

105
00:04:48,489 --> 00:04:49,521
I wasn't.

106
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:50,667
Yeah, but then you did.

107
00:04:50,691 --> 00:04:52,168
Right, but some people don't.

108
00:04:52,192 --> 00:04:54,270
So, what, we just keep
doing what we're doing

109
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:57,295
for the next 20
years, and that's it?

110
00:04:57,364 --> 00:05:00,465
But if you're together,
what does it matter?

111
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:03,803
Hey!

112
00:05:03,854 --> 00:05:04,986
Hey.

113
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:06,465
Didn't see you there.

114
00:05:06,489 --> 00:05:07,923
You okay?

115
00:05:08,992 --> 00:05:10,391
Yep.

116
00:05:12,846 --> 00:05:17,181
Baby, I'm here. I'm right here.

117
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:19,150
He can't feel your hand.

118
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:22,541
Right.

119
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:29,327
Jason?

120
00:05:29,396 --> 00:05:31,429
My name is Dr. Yang.

121
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:33,364
I know you must be
very confused right now,

122
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:37,002
but I need to ask you
some questions, okay?

123
00:05:37,071 --> 00:05:40,588
There's a tube down your
throat, so you can't speak,

124
00:05:40,657 --> 00:05:43,457
but you should be
able to nod "yes" or "no."

125
00:05:43,526 --> 00:05:44,859
Think you can do that for me?

126
00:05:47,063 --> 00:05:48,997
That's great. Okay.
Let's get started.

127
00:05:49,066 --> 00:05:51,416
Do you know who you are?

128
00:05:54,154 --> 00:05:55,587
Do you know where you are?

129
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,426
Do you know what
has happened to you?

130
00:06:04,881 --> 00:06:06,314
You were in a car accident.

131
00:06:06,383 --> 00:06:08,183
Your vehicle was
hit from behind,

132
00:06:08,251 --> 00:06:10,752
and you flipped over
into oncoming traffic.

133
00:06:10,821 --> 00:06:12,620
You're in a hospital right now.

134
00:06:16,426 --> 00:06:17,558
Do you know who this is?

135
00:06:21,731 --> 00:06:24,833
Your spine was
crushed in the accident,

136
00:06:24,902 --> 00:06:28,302
and you are paralyzed
from the neck down.

137
00:06:28,371 --> 00:06:30,722
You're currently breathing
with the help of a ventilator.

138
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:32,106
That's the tube in your mouth.

139
00:06:32,175 --> 00:06:34,759
Now, I understand
it might be your wish

140
00:06:34,828 --> 00:06:36,545
for me to remove the vent?

141
00:06:41,417 --> 00:06:44,135
I want to make sure you
understand what this means.

142
00:06:44,204 --> 00:06:47,205
The ventilator is
breathing for you.

143
00:06:49,526 --> 00:06:51,376
That means, once it's removed,

144
00:06:51,445 --> 00:06:53,245
you will not be able
to breathe on your own.

145
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:57,515
Now, if you can't breathe,

146
00:06:57,584 --> 00:06:58,683
you will die.

147
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:01,886
It might take a few
hours, probably less.

148
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:04,989
Do you understand this?

149
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,292
Oh, God.

150
00:07:10,747 --> 00:07:13,215
Do you still want me
to remove the vent?

151
00:07:15,818 --> 00:07:17,986
I love you.

152
00:07:21,225 --> 00:07:24,959
And I want you to know,
whatever you decide,

153
00:07:26,813 --> 00:07:29,914
I'll support you.

154
00:07:29,983 --> 00:07:33,551
I'll be by your side,
no matter what.

155
00:07:40,994 --> 00:07:44,629
I'm sorry, but I have
to ask one more time.

156
00:07:44,698 --> 00:07:47,265
Jason,

157
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,316
would you like me
to remove the vent?

158
00:08:16,379 --> 00:08:18,546
<i>Do you know who you are?</i>

159
00:08:28,025 --> 00:08:30,091
<i>Do you know what's
happened to you?</i>

160
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:35,613
<i>Do you want to live this way?</i>

161
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:41,753
Oh! God!

162
00:08:42,823 --> 00:08:44,105
Hey, you.

163
00:08:44,174 --> 00:08:46,552
What are we doing?
What the hell are we doing?

164
00:08:46,576 --> 00:08:49,127
I'm waiting for an elevator?

165
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:50,961
I just spent my day

166
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,376
saving the life of a man
who's now choosing to die,

167
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:57,736
and all I keep thinking is...

168
00:08:57,804 --> 00:09:01,573
You and I are
throwing so much away.

169
00:09:01,642 --> 00:09:03,474
We should be together.

170
00:09:03,544 --> 00:09:05,788
You're the love of
my life, and it is stupid,

171
00:09:05,812 --> 00:09:09,213
just stupid for us
to keep pretending.

172
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:11,216
I love you.

173
00:09:11,285 --> 00:09:14,369
I want to be with
you for real, forever.

174
00:09:14,437 --> 00:09:16,571
It's as simple as that.

175
00:09:39,346 --> 00:09:41,829
That's it. We've christened
every room in this house.

176
00:09:41,898 --> 00:09:43,681
Yeah.

177
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,461
And it's a pretty big
house. Mmm-hmm.

178
00:09:45,485 --> 00:09:47,313
I thought I wasn't gonna make
it through to the guest room.

179
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:50,217
Yeah, but you rallied at
the end. Mmm-hmm, I did.

180
00:09:51,325 --> 00:09:56,093
You know, the house feels big
for just two of us. Don't you think?

181
00:09:56,162 --> 00:09:58,741
That's because there
isn't any furniture in it yet.

182
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:01,599
Yeah. Yeah, maybe.

183
00:10:07,557 --> 00:10:09,791
Ah! He is gorgeous.

184
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:11,793
No. Oh.

185
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:14,162
Okay. Um...

186
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:15,262
This one.

187
00:10:15,331 --> 00:10:17,631
I agreed to a dog, not a horse.

188
00:10:17,701 --> 00:10:19,433
That's a mid-size dog.

189
00:10:19,502 --> 00:10:21,747
No, that is huge. You
know what a big dog makes?

190
00:10:21,771 --> 00:10:23,349
What? Big poop.

191
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:26,841
That thing could crap my
entire body weight in a day.

192
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:29,477
That is a beautiful
image. Thank you.

193
00:10:33,834 --> 00:10:34,882
That one.

194
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:36,045
What? That's the one.

195
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:38,570
No, no. That is not even a dog.

196
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:41,055
That is a rodent,
and it looks mean.

197
00:10:41,124 --> 00:10:42,568
We want this thing in here.

198
00:10:42,592 --> 00:10:45,259
Can someone get it out?

199
00:10:45,328 --> 00:10:47,562
Pre-op labs were
perfect. Vitals are strong.

200
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:49,442
Jasper O'Neil's
prepped and ready

201
00:10:49,466 --> 00:10:53,167
to be our 11th successful
conduit implantation.

202
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:55,570
Hey, Dr. Ross. Hey, Dr. Ross.

203
00:11:00,376 --> 00:11:01,704
Can you do something
about the groupies?

204
00:11:01,728 --> 00:11:03,790
I've done absolutely
nothing inappropriate.

205
00:11:03,814 --> 00:11:06,981
That's the problem. Do
something inappropriate.

206
00:11:07,049 --> 00:11:08,466
Break one of their hearts.

207
00:11:08,535 --> 00:11:10,969
The others will hate you
in solidarity with the first.

208
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:13,705
Then there'll be a little
less giggling in the hallways.

209
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:15,413
I can't hear myself
think around here.

210
00:11:15,475 --> 00:11:17,074
Think about the fact that

211
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:19,371
we're sailing into phase two
of our groundbreaking study.

212
00:11:19,395 --> 00:11:21,595
Don't get cocky. It's not
a success until it's over.

213
00:11:21,682 --> 00:11:24,716
I'm not cocky. I'm just
glad to be along for the ride.

214
00:11:24,785 --> 00:11:26,705
I'm the happiest backup
singer in the business.

215
00:11:29,322 --> 00:11:30,322
Oh, hey.

216
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:31,656
After your conduit surgery,

217
00:11:31,725 --> 00:11:33,268
can you talk to somebody
from <i>American Cardiology?</i>

218
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:34,492
They heard about the study.

219
00:11:34,561 --> 00:11:36,327
It's not done yet.

220
00:11:36,396 --> 00:11:37,656
Yeah, they're writing a
process piece. Can't hurt.

221
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,180
Okay. Oh, hey,

222
00:11:39,249 --> 00:11:42,116
how's your hand since
the last operation?

223
00:11:42,185 --> 00:11:43,551
Recovering okay?

224
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:44,885
Yeah. Slow but sure.

225
00:11:44,955 --> 00:11:46,087
It's slow.

226
00:11:49,326 --> 00:11:51,403
- Conduit, please.
- Fresh off the printer.

227
00:11:51,427 --> 00:11:53,239
Kid's tiny for 12 months.

228
00:11:53,263 --> 00:11:54,873
He'll grow when
his heart's sending

229
00:11:54,897 --> 00:11:56,442
a little more blood
around the system.

230
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:58,010
The first couple kids
we put conduits in,

231
00:11:58,034 --> 00:11:59,946
you can already see the
difference in only a year.

232
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:02,636
Hey. So, I have an
emergency surgery.

233
00:12:02,705 --> 00:12:04,366
I'm gonna be in the OR
for the next nine hours.

234
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,435
Okay. Mrs. Rodriguez!

235
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:09,260
Oh, no. This is gonna
take me at least three hours.

236
00:12:09,329 --> 00:12:10,989
Well, Mrs. Rodriguez
is not gonna make it.

237
00:12:11,013 --> 00:12:12,113
Is she a cardio patient?

238
00:12:12,182 --> 00:12:14,232
I could have somebody
page you a consult.

239
00:12:14,301 --> 00:12:16,529
Mrs. Rodriguez will last until
I finish here, and then I'll go.

240
00:12:16,553 --> 00:12:18,519
Ross, you'll close for me?

241
00:12:18,588 --> 00:12:20,338
Yeah. Are you sure?

242
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:21,984
Well, this is why I said we
should keep the damn dog

243
00:12:22,008 --> 00:12:23,252
in the kitchen when we're gone.

244
00:12:23,276 --> 00:12:24,787
I am not locking the
dog in the kitchen.

245
00:12:24,811 --> 00:12:26,955
Well, then you can clean up the
puddle on the rug when you get home.

246
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:28,057
I'll leave it for you!

247
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:29,547
You got a dog?

248
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:31,716
Yes.

249
00:12:31,785 --> 00:12:32,878
Thing's gonna be dead in a week.

250
00:12:32,902 --> 00:12:35,653
Wait. You named your
dog Mrs. Rodriguez?

251
00:12:35,705 --> 00:12:37,600
When you meet
him, you'll understand.

252
00:12:37,624 --> 00:12:39,984
Meet him soon, before he dies.

253
00:12:40,043 --> 00:12:41,375
What? I'm a physician!

254
00:12:41,444 --> 00:12:43,623
It's not like I'm gonna have
trouble keeping an animal alive.

255
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:46,146
Uh-huh. Do you have
5-0 prolene, please?

256
00:12:46,216 --> 00:12:47,726
What? You think I
can't keep a dog alive?

257
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:48,878
Whatever. Don't worry about it.

258
00:12:48,902 --> 00:12:49,982
He's perfectly healthy.

259
00:12:52,055 --> 00:12:54,155
Alex, it's not funny.

260
00:12:58,795 --> 00:13:01,029
What are you doing,
Zola? What are you doing?

261
00:13:01,097 --> 00:13:02,564
Whipple.

262
00:13:02,632 --> 00:13:03,998
A Whipple?

263
00:13:04,067 --> 00:13:06,945
It's when you take out
part of someone's pancreas.

264
00:13:06,969 --> 00:13:08,330
Oh, I know what a Whipple is.

265
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:11,339
You've probably
seen Mommy do one.

266
00:13:11,407 --> 00:13:12,618
Well, I've done a Whipple.

267
00:13:12,642 --> 00:13:14,208
You do hearts.

268
00:13:14,277 --> 00:13:17,797
You don't do a Whipple on the
heart, you do it on the pancreas.

269
00:13:18,481 --> 00:13:21,883
Yes, you mentioned
that. Thank you.

270
00:13:25,504 --> 00:13:27,183
I can't believe I
let you talk me into

271
00:13:27,207 --> 00:13:28,784
letting that thing
into my house.

272
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:31,059
Mrs. Rodriguez
is great with kids.

273
00:13:31,127 --> 00:13:33,594
Zola, don't you want
to play with the doggy?

274
00:13:33,663 --> 00:13:35,612
No.

275
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:37,726
I'm not sure if any
of these are gonna fit

276
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,246
because I don't think Bailey was
ever as small as Mrs. Rodriguez.

277
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:41,402
He's not that small.

278
00:13:41,471 --> 00:13:42,582
He's a squirrel.

279
00:13:42,606 --> 00:13:44,338
Oh, this is perfect.

280
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:46,218
I can't believe you're
gonna dress the dog

281
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:47,786
in my son's sweater.

282
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:49,843
Mrs. Rodriguez gets cold.

283
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:53,714
He doesn't have the constitution
for all this damp and rain.

284
00:13:53,783 --> 00:13:55,983
He gets the shakes.

285
00:13:56,736 --> 00:13:57,796
What?

286
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:59,320
You like the dog!

287
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:00,972
He's an unusual dog.

288
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,385
It's not like I'm becoming
someone who likes dogs.

289
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:05,938
He just happens to
relate to people like I do.

290
00:14:05,962 --> 00:14:07,061
Uh-huh.

291
00:14:07,129 --> 00:14:08,474
It's true. I mean,
he doesn't want to

292
00:14:08,498 --> 00:14:10,665
talk about his
feelings or the future.

293
00:14:10,733 --> 00:14:13,145
If I walk him and feed
him on a regular schedule,

294
00:14:13,169 --> 00:14:14,946
he'll curl up next
to me on the couch,

295
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:17,032
and if I don't, he'll
bite my ankles.

296
00:14:17,056 --> 00:14:19,001
It's a set of behaviors
that makes sense to me.

297
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:20,441
You like the dog.

298
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:22,310
The dog gets you.

299
00:14:22,379 --> 00:14:26,447
You're alike. That's how
I talk about my children.

300
00:14:26,516 --> 00:14:29,500
You have a baby. A dog baby. Oh!

301
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:31,919
Mrs. Rodriguez!

302
00:14:34,257 --> 00:14:36,402
I'm sorry. I know
how painful it is.

303
00:14:36,426 --> 00:14:38,146
I've been through it myself,

304
00:14:38,194 --> 00:14:39,805
but it's been over two
years since the injury,

305
00:14:39,829 --> 00:14:41,507
and at some point, you just
have to say enough is enough.

306
00:14:41,531 --> 00:14:42,975
What? No. You
have no idea where...

307
00:14:42,999 --> 00:14:44,759
Look, your hand needs
more time, all right?

308
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:46,862
Just give your hand rest,
throw yourself into the rehab.

309
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:49,047
I've done the rehab!
It's been two years!

310
00:14:49,071 --> 00:14:50,733
It's done, okay? I'm
good enough to operate.

311
00:14:50,757 --> 00:14:53,519
I mean, what is this? Is
this about Mr. Willenstein?

312
00:14:53,543 --> 00:14:56,544
That was a routine... The
decision has been made.

313
00:14:56,612 --> 00:14:58,524
You can keep your
administrative duties,

314
00:14:58,548 --> 00:15:00,781
but you are not
cleared to operate.

315
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:02,570
You're not going back in the OR.

316
00:15:12,028 --> 00:15:13,772
Any other business
before we adjourn?

317
00:15:13,796 --> 00:15:15,980
Actually, yes, there is.

318
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:19,595
<i>You had to bring
it up to the board!</i>

319
00:15:19,619 --> 00:15:21,185
Yeah. It was time.

320
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:22,564
It absolutely was not time.

321
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,100
We didn't make the decision yet.

322
00:15:24,124 --> 00:15:26,557
Well, clearly, I'm
wrong, 'cause we did.

323
00:15:26,626 --> 00:15:27,859
I just wasn't part of it.

324
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:30,795
Listen, it is the
job of a lifetime.

325
00:15:30,864 --> 00:15:34,165
Running the entire military
trauma division with Teddy,

326
00:15:34,234 --> 00:15:37,079
it's what's next for me,
Cristina. I can feel it.

327
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:38,602
Yeah, in Germany!

328
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:41,205
We have a house!
I have my trial!

329
00:15:42,642 --> 00:15:44,475
We are good here,
Owen. We're happy.

330
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:46,177
We can't just leave everything.

331
00:15:46,246 --> 00:15:47,689
Just listen to me
for one second...

332
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:48,953
No. No. You want to know what?

333
00:15:49,015 --> 00:15:50,414
You're not backing me into this.

334
00:15:50,483 --> 00:15:52,461
Come on. Nobody
backs you into anything.

335
00:15:52,485 --> 00:15:53,579
Believe me. I've tried.

336
00:15:53,603 --> 00:15:54,964
So, you want me to
dump my whole trial,

337
00:15:54,988 --> 00:15:56,198
just when I'm starting to get...

338
00:15:56,222 --> 00:15:58,239
That is not what
I'm... Please stop.

339
00:15:58,324 --> 00:16:00,435
Stop acting like you're
some hit-and-run victim.

340
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,143
I can't have
another conversation

341
00:16:02,212 --> 00:16:03,977
where the idea that my career

342
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:06,947
or, in fact, any of my
wishes might come first

343
00:16:07,016 --> 00:16:09,983
is presented as some
crime against humanity!

344
00:16:10,053 --> 00:16:11,363
Oh, what?

345
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:13,032
So, now we're back
where we started?

346
00:16:13,056 --> 00:16:14,855
I never give you anything,

347
00:16:14,924 --> 00:16:17,484
so the terms under which we're
together are that your dreams die?

348
00:16:18,761 --> 00:16:20,105
Can you quiet the damn dog?

349
00:16:20,129 --> 00:16:21,824
You know what? You quiet the
damn dog. You wanted the dog.

350
00:16:21,848 --> 00:16:23,993
Not that dog! He doesn't
even like me. He only likes you.

351
00:16:24,017 --> 00:16:26,862
Because you make stupid
decisions! And he knows it!

352
00:16:26,886 --> 00:16:29,097
I'm not moving to Germany!

353
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:33,458
So, that's it?
Conversation's over? Uh-huh.

354
00:16:33,526 --> 00:16:35,743
Of course it is.

355
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:39,759
I don't know why I ever
entertained the idea for one second

356
00:16:39,783 --> 00:16:43,250
that we might ever do
anything that I'd want.

357
00:16:48,224 --> 00:16:50,508
Shh!

358
00:16:50,577 --> 00:16:52,304
Where's my portable ultrasound?

359
00:16:52,328 --> 00:16:54,848
Screw it. We know we're going
in. Let's just get him upstairs.

360
00:16:54,897 --> 00:16:57,365
Oh, look at you
two. So grown up.

361
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:58,682
The dark blue suits you.

362
00:16:58,751 --> 00:16:59,991
Yeah. Watch your toes.

363
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:03,770
Coming through! Dr. Yang!

364
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:05,417
Oh, whatever it is, it can wait.

365
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,086
My shift is over,
and I am going home.

366
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:09,343
Come on. Patient
11... Jasper O'Neil.

367
00:17:09,412 --> 00:17:10,689
He's back for his
annual checkup.

368
00:17:10,713 --> 00:17:12,741
Apparently, he's
learning to play hockey.

369
00:17:12,765 --> 00:17:14,865
You handle it. Send him my best.

370
00:17:14,934 --> 00:17:16,545
But if my conduit gets smashed

371
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:19,002
because they let their kid
get body-checked on the ice,

372
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:21,004
I'm killing them! Will do.

373
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:22,306
Oh! Hi!

374
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:23,452
Who'd have thunk it?

375
00:17:23,476 --> 00:17:25,610
You and me, we're belly buddies.

376
00:17:25,678 --> 00:17:27,111
No, we're not.

377
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:36,732
Breathe. It's okay.
You're almost there.

378
00:17:36,756 --> 00:17:37,933
All you have to do is push.

379
00:17:37,957 --> 00:17:39,523
No. No can do.

380
00:17:39,592 --> 00:17:41,236
We are almost there. He's
gonna have to stay in there.

381
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,961
I've got a cozy womb.
He'll be happier.

382
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,963
It'll be better for everyone.

383
00:17:46,032 --> 00:17:47,509
Oh, my God! Oh, God! Oh, God!

384
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:49,078
You have to wait a
second. No, I can't.

385
00:17:49,102 --> 00:17:50,768
You have to wait one second.

386
00:17:50,837 --> 00:17:53,198
Oh, God. This is a
mistake. It's a mistake!

387
00:17:53,222 --> 00:17:54,983
I Can't! I can't! What?

388
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:56,123
This is a mistake, Mer!

389
00:17:56,192 --> 00:17:57,432
Everyone says that.

390
00:17:57,477 --> 00:17:59,054
Here we go. We
need one more push.

391
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,878
Okay, now!

392
00:18:00,947 --> 00:18:02,680
Push! Push! Push!

393
00:18:07,353 --> 00:18:08,753
Great!

394
00:18:29,992 --> 00:18:31,559
I screwed up, Mer.

395
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:35,445
Mer, I screwed up.
I really screwed up.

396
00:18:36,015 --> 00:18:37,482
Shh.

397
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:38,683
I can't...

398
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:48,642
Oh...

399
00:18:51,114 --> 00:18:52,345
Hello.

400
00:18:56,836 --> 00:18:59,303
Go back to sleep. I got this.

401
00:18:59,372 --> 00:19:00,704
Okay.

402
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:38,575
It's okay.

403
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:39,721
You're being so good.

404
00:19:39,745 --> 00:19:41,712
Yeah. He's fine. He's fine.

405
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:47,151
This is all my fault. You
know, I was at the park,

406
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,300
and I looked away for a
second when Ross texted me.

407
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:50,699
I was standing right there.

408
00:19:50,723 --> 00:19:52,500
Listen, it's okay.
These things happen.

409
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:53,902
And have you met our son?

410
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:55,537
He lunges headfirst
into everything.

411
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:56,972
It's a wonder this
never happened sooner.

412
00:19:56,996 --> 00:19:58,629
Well, we can't go
back to that park.

413
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:01,309
They need, like, sand or
some of that soft turf stuff.

414
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,746
I mean, who puts concrete
steps by a play space?

415
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:05,213
It's completely irresponsible.

416
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:06,965
It is a superficial cut.
He's gonna be fine.

417
00:20:06,989 --> 00:20:08,300
I'm already late for my meeting.

418
00:20:08,324 --> 00:20:10,123
I can't just stick
him in daycare.

419
00:20:10,192 --> 00:20:13,327
Slow down. Slow down, okay?

420
00:20:13,395 --> 00:20:15,007
Now, we're gonna
figure this out.

421
00:20:15,031 --> 00:20:18,410
And, by the way, daycare
has very capable teachers.

422
00:20:18,434 --> 00:20:21,135
Oh, please. I am capable.

423
00:20:21,203 --> 00:20:23,265
So, your text said, "make
sure the phase 3 patients go."

424
00:20:23,289 --> 00:20:25,539
Go to the bathroom? Go away?

425
00:20:25,608 --> 00:20:27,225
Sorry. I didn't
realize. Is he okay?

426
00:20:27,293 --> 00:20:28,920
Yes. CRISTINA: No.

427
00:20:28,944 --> 00:20:30,672
Do you want me to reschedule
the phase 3 patient meetings today,

428
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:32,157
maybe try to squeeze
them in next week, or...

429
00:20:32,181 --> 00:20:34,682
No, just...

430
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:36,928
Ross, will you take them?
You understand the procedure.

431
00:20:36,952 --> 00:20:38,397
You know what to do. Just...

432
00:20:38,421 --> 00:20:40,699
You know, I want you to
take over phase 3 from here.

433
00:20:40,723 --> 00:20:42,389
What? Are you sure?

434
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:45,509
Yes. Can you do this for
me? Just do this for me, okay?

435
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:48,295
Of course, if that's
what you want.

436
00:21:01,077 --> 00:21:04,377
I can't believe
Bailey's already seven.

437
00:21:04,446 --> 00:21:06,880
Please tell me he has
outgrown that whole

438
00:21:06,949 --> 00:21:08,982
"I fiddle with my
junk 24/7" phase,

439
00:21:09,051 --> 00:21:14,088
'cause I have to practically
duct-tape Theo's pants on his body.

440
00:21:14,156 --> 00:21:17,557
Of all the conversations that
you and I have had about boys,

441
00:21:17,626 --> 00:21:20,906
I didn't expect
this one to be it.

442
00:21:24,967 --> 00:21:26,584
Feel any kicks yet?

443
00:21:26,653 --> 00:21:28,786
Uh, no, not really.

444
00:21:30,523 --> 00:21:32,563
Nauseous? Just tired.

445
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:38,913
Every day, I go to
work and do my job.

446
00:21:38,981 --> 00:21:40,965
Then I come home
and do that job.

447
00:21:41,934 --> 00:21:44,234
I'm so tired.

448
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,036
It's like I'm
sleepwalking all the time.

449
00:21:46,105 --> 00:21:49,368
Well, you're well into
your second trimester now,

450
00:21:49,392 --> 00:21:50,936
so that'll start getting better.

451
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,260
It's not the pregnancy.

452
00:21:55,548 --> 00:21:57,280
Cristina...

453
00:21:57,349 --> 00:21:59,049
Look how happy he is.

454
00:22:01,804 --> 00:22:04,933
Hey, Cristina, have you talked to
Ross since he went to Hopkins?

455
00:22:04,957 --> 00:22:05,957
Uh, no.

456
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,438
Hey, girls. Do you
wanna go along?

457
00:22:09,462 --> 00:22:10,956
To the bouncy house?
Yeah! The bouncy house.

458
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:14,460
Oh, that sounds like so much
fun. You wanna go? Yeah?

459
00:22:14,516 --> 00:22:17,901
Oh, hey. What did...
What did Ericson say?

460
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:19,748
Yes, thank you
for that referral.

461
00:22:19,772 --> 00:22:23,106
Um, he basically said what
everyone's been saying,

462
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:25,615
damage to Jackson's
hand is permanent.

463
00:22:26,012 --> 00:22:28,379
Oh, I'm so sorry.

464
00:22:28,447 --> 00:22:29,841
He's been to every specialist,

465
00:22:29,865 --> 00:22:33,801
he has tried every
treatment plan that...

466
00:22:35,204 --> 00:22:37,382
I am just really, really
hoping that after this last one

467
00:22:37,406 --> 00:22:41,006
he's finally gonna be able to
come to terms with it, you know?

468
00:22:43,312 --> 00:22:45,913
So, Thailand. Really?

469
00:22:45,981 --> 00:22:47,559
Now, I know what you
guys are thinking, all right?

470
00:22:47,583 --> 00:22:49,027
But I figure I might as
well meet with this guy.

471
00:22:49,051 --> 00:22:50,462
I mean, it could be
nothing, sure. Okay?

472
00:22:50,486 --> 00:22:52,670
But I got a good feeling
about this one, guys.

473
00:22:52,738 --> 00:22:54,438
Six months from now,

474
00:22:54,506 --> 00:22:56,666
I'll probably be back
on the surgical rotation.

475
00:22:59,912 --> 00:23:03,280
You know, I wouldn't be in
such a hurry if I were you.

476
00:23:03,349 --> 00:23:04,715
You know, you're lucky.

477
00:23:04,784 --> 00:23:06,161
Just getting to spend your time

478
00:23:06,185 --> 00:23:07,529
between the
foundation and your kids.

479
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:09,464
I would kill to have that
much time with Theo.

480
00:23:09,488 --> 00:23:13,273
You don't have to stay at home
all day, every day, babysitting.

481
00:23:13,342 --> 00:23:16,810
Now April's on me about
another one. Can you believe that?

482
00:23:16,879 --> 00:23:17,895
Yeah, right.

483
00:23:24,804 --> 00:23:26,169
It's chilly.

484
00:23:26,239 --> 00:23:27,839
Uh, Cristina. What?

485
00:23:28,724 --> 00:23:31,424
Have you got a... Do
you have a sweater?

486
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:41,051
You're not dressed?

487
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:43,320
We need to get going.

488
00:23:43,388 --> 00:23:46,707
The Harper Avery Awards await.

489
00:23:46,775 --> 00:23:50,494
Are you nervous? Are you okay?

490
00:23:50,563 --> 00:23:53,030
Do you need a minute? No.

491
00:23:54,567 --> 00:23:55,567
Maybe.

492
00:23:55,617 --> 00:23:58,518
Okay. But just a minute.

493
00:23:58,587 --> 00:24:00,332
And then nerves of steel.

494
00:24:00,356 --> 00:24:01,788
Right?

495
00:24:01,858 --> 00:24:02,858
Right.

496
00:24:02,925 --> 00:24:04,125
Okay.

497
00:24:06,495 --> 00:24:09,713
<i>The surgical mind needs
to be constantly inspired,</i>

498
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:12,566
always asking the
toughest questions.

499
00:24:12,634 --> 00:24:16,370
The Harper Avery Award
is a celebration of that,

500
00:24:16,439 --> 00:24:20,807
of the kind of mind I
saw in tonight's recipient,

501
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:24,578
even when he was just an intern.

502
00:24:24,647 --> 00:24:27,681
Ladies and gentlemen, I
am honored to present to you

503
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:30,484
this year's Harper
Avery Award recipient

504
00:24:30,553 --> 00:24:31,935
to Dr. Shane Ross.

505
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:46,683
Thank you. Thank you.

506
00:24:46,752 --> 00:24:50,604
First and foremost, I'd
like to thank Dr. Yang.

507
00:24:50,673 --> 00:24:52,740
I wouldn't be here
without your guidance,

508
00:24:52,808 --> 00:24:55,108
encouragement, and support.

509
00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:00,692
All it takes is one
person, one patient

510
00:25:00,716 --> 00:25:04,685
to change your life forever.

511
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:07,465
When I first met Jasper
O'Neil, he was 12 months old,

512
00:25:07,489 --> 00:25:10,891
and we didn't think
he'd make it to 13.

513
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,503
He's here with us tonight.

514
00:25:12,527 --> 00:25:15,007
Jasper, would you
stand up, please?

515
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:25,589
Cristina. Cristina.

516
00:25:26,992 --> 00:25:30,311
<i>Do you know who you are?</i>

517
00:25:30,379 --> 00:25:33,814
<i>Do you know what's
happened to you?</i>

518
00:25:33,882 --> 00:25:36,016
<i>Do you want to live this way?</i>

519
00:25:36,085 --> 00:25:37,162
<i>I love you.</i>

520
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:43,123
And I want you to know
that whatever you decide,

521
00:25:43,191 --> 00:25:46,693
I'll support you.

522
00:25:46,762 --> 00:25:48,161
I'll be by your side...

523
00:25:49,615 --> 00:25:51,248
No matter what.

524
00:25:52,818 --> 00:25:56,686
I'm sorry, but I have
to ask one more time.

525
00:25:56,755 --> 00:25:58,989
Jason,

526
00:25:59,058 --> 00:26:01,074
would you like me
to remove the vent?

527
00:26:39,699 --> 00:26:41,899
Ah!

528
00:26:42,117 --> 00:26:43,157
Son of a...

529
00:26:44,136 --> 00:26:45,602
Hey, you.

530
00:26:45,671 --> 00:26:47,182
I just spent my day
saving the life of a man

531
00:26:47,206 --> 00:26:49,756
who could've chosen
to die but didn't.

532
00:26:49,825 --> 00:26:54,061
I repaired a heart that
was impossible to repair.

533
00:26:54,129 --> 00:26:58,715
I achieved the impossible
today, and it feels good.

534
00:26:58,784 --> 00:27:01,201
No. More.

535
00:27:01,269 --> 00:27:03,703
It feels incredible.

536
00:27:06,325 --> 00:27:08,405
What are you doing right now?

537
00:27:08,927 --> 00:27:11,161
Waiting for the elevator.

538
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:12,907
Yeah. We're gonna
have to take the stairs,

539
00:27:12,931 --> 00:27:16,111
'cause I just finished my
shift, and I feel like celebrating.

540
00:27:16,135 --> 00:27:18,051
Tonight...

541
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,420
Naked. With you.

542
00:27:20,489 --> 00:27:22,739
Oh. I could be into that.

543
00:27:38,307 --> 00:27:40,374
Are you

544
00:27:40,442 --> 00:27:42,387
sure you're okay with this?

545
00:27:45,647 --> 00:27:47,697
Oh, yeah, yeah. I'm very sure.

546
00:27:47,766 --> 00:27:49,193
No, no.

547
00:27:49,217 --> 00:27:50,337
No, not... Not this.

548
00:27:52,854 --> 00:27:55,588
Us being

549
00:27:57,526 --> 00:27:59,442
just us.

550
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:03,446
I know.

551
00:28:03,516 --> 00:28:05,749
And I'm good.

552
00:28:05,818 --> 00:28:06,984
I am.

553
00:28:09,555 --> 00:28:11,855
You said you were
okay. You told me...

554
00:28:11,924 --> 00:28:14,202
You told me that... I thought
I was, okay? But I'm not.

555
00:28:14,226 --> 00:28:16,877
What does that... I
just need my films.

556
00:28:18,446 --> 00:28:21,565
Not right this second, though.

557
00:28:21,634 --> 00:28:24,601
Listen, all I am asking

558
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:26,986
is that we just reopen
this conversation.

559
00:28:27,073 --> 00:28:28,683
No! There is nothing
left to talk about.

560
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:31,269
Owen, I was clear
about this. I was so clear.

561
00:28:31,293 --> 00:28:34,222
I can't give you more than
what I am already giving,

562
00:28:34,246 --> 00:28:35,390
and if now you need more...

563
00:28:35,414 --> 00:28:37,314
Yes, I think I do! I think I do!

564
00:28:37,383 --> 00:28:39,783
Well, then get it
somewhere else.

565
00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:42,553
Oh.

566
00:28:45,257 --> 00:28:46,290
Okay, I will.

567
00:28:56,918 --> 00:28:58,184
<i>It's over.</i>

568
00:28:58,253 --> 00:29:01,254
No, this time, Owen
and I are really over.

569
00:29:01,323 --> 00:29:04,257
I mean, we can't keep falling
back into the same pattern.

570
00:29:04,326 --> 00:29:07,060
It's just...

571
00:29:07,128 --> 00:29:10,129
Mer? You awake?

572
00:29:10,198 --> 00:29:13,967
Yeah. You and
Owen are over again.

573
00:29:14,035 --> 00:29:16,403
I'm totally listening. Continue.

574
00:29:16,472 --> 00:29:17,804
Well, see? That's the point...

575
00:29:17,873 --> 00:29:19,906
It can't continue the way it is.

576
00:29:19,975 --> 00:29:22,175
It's not good, it's not healthy.

577
00:29:22,244 --> 00:29:25,256
Your heart's healthy enough now
that you'd be an excellent candidate

578
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,592
for the type of research
they're doing. Mmm-hmm.

579
00:29:27,616 --> 00:29:29,082
Could it hurt him?

580
00:29:29,151 --> 00:29:30,945
No. It is a surgery.

581
00:29:30,969 --> 00:29:33,681
I would implant an array of
wireless sensors into his skull

582
00:29:33,705 --> 00:29:35,650
that would transmit
electrical activity.

583
00:29:35,674 --> 00:29:37,635
But none of our subjects
ever complained of pain.

584
00:29:37,659 --> 00:29:39,371
It's a chance to help us,

585
00:29:39,395 --> 00:29:40,888
to help revolutionize treatment
for people like yourself.

586
00:29:40,912 --> 00:29:41,912
Hmm?

587
00:29:41,964 --> 00:29:43,008
What do you think, hon?

588
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:49,336
It'll help "people like me."

589
00:29:49,405 --> 00:29:50,988
It won't help me?

590
00:29:52,691 --> 00:29:54,569
Look, two years
ago our loftiest goal

591
00:29:54,593 --> 00:29:56,704
was picking up a rubber
ball with a robotic arm,

592
00:29:56,728 --> 00:29:59,307
but now, thanks to Dr. Shepherd's
brain-mapping initiative,

593
00:29:59,331 --> 00:30:01,542
we've already come
so much further.

594
00:30:01,566 --> 00:30:04,012
Well, the point is that
technology is changing every day.

595
00:30:04,036 --> 00:30:08,672
We have no idea where it's
gonna go or how it might help you.

596
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:12,776
Honey, wouldn't it be
nice to have a place to go

597
00:30:12,845 --> 00:30:15,590
instead of sitting
around the house all day?

598
00:30:15,614 --> 00:30:19,983
To have something on the
calendar? Wouldn't that be fun?

599
00:30:20,052 --> 00:30:22,685
It's something, Jason.
It's something we can do.

600
00:30:23,521 --> 00:30:24,688
Please?

601
00:30:26,275 --> 00:30:28,141
I don't care.

602
00:30:28,209 --> 00:30:29,242
Fine.

603
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:35,079
Okay, great. All right. Elise,
let's go fill out the paperwork.

604
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:41,471
Thank you, Dr. Yang,
for thinking of us.

605
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:44,374
Oh, no, actually, it
was Chief Hunt's idea.

606
00:30:44,443 --> 00:30:45,486
He told us about Jason.

607
00:30:46,578 --> 00:30:49,028
Oh, well, thank you, Dr. Hunt.

608
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:50,647
It's gonna be great for him.

609
00:30:50,716 --> 00:30:52,115
Well, good luck.

610
00:30:55,888 --> 00:30:57,370
What?

611
00:30:57,439 --> 00:30:59,234
That was a really nice
thing you did for them.

612
00:30:59,258 --> 00:31:00,885
Oh, well,

613
00:31:00,909 --> 00:31:04,611
I'm a really nice guy,
or so I've been told.

614
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,591
<i>I would never ask you for that.</i>

615
00:31:06,615 --> 00:31:08,315
You're not asking.
I am telling you.

616
00:31:08,384 --> 00:31:10,584
Well...

617
00:31:10,653 --> 00:31:12,519
I don't believe you.

618
00:31:12,588 --> 00:31:15,305
Cristina, people change.

619
00:31:15,374 --> 00:31:18,041
I mean, you're not the same
person that you were when we met.

620
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:19,309
I can change, too.

621
00:31:19,378 --> 00:31:21,811
Really?

622
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:26,216
People who want kids
don't just stop wanting them.

623
00:31:28,987 --> 00:31:30,398
Don't give up things for me.

624
00:31:30,422 --> 00:31:33,390
Hey. I'm not.

625
00:31:33,459 --> 00:31:35,125
I haven't.

626
00:31:37,596 --> 00:31:39,596
I'm not giving up anything.

627
00:31:45,804 --> 00:31:47,482
How much longer are
we supposed to wait?

628
00:31:47,506 --> 00:31:50,374
As long as it takes. I
think they deserve that.

629
00:31:50,442 --> 00:31:51,753
Are you impervious to cold?

630
00:31:51,777 --> 00:31:53,109
I'm impervious to whining.

631
00:31:53,178 --> 00:31:55,545
Well, I'm not. I... Yang.

632
00:32:02,637 --> 00:32:04,571
Hey. WOMAN 2: Hey.

633
00:32:08,526 --> 00:32:09,792
Oh, no.

634
00:32:11,296 --> 00:32:12,562
Did you hear?

635
00:32:22,424 --> 00:32:26,159
Oh, my God. I wanna talk to you.

636
00:32:26,228 --> 00:32:28,678
Thank you. I couldn't
have done it without you.

637
00:32:29,514 --> 00:32:30,594
Of course.

638
00:32:36,438 --> 00:32:38,738
Well, they want me
in Mayo on Thursday.

639
00:32:39,925 --> 00:32:41,552
Congratulations, Murphy. Yeah.

640
00:32:41,576 --> 00:32:43,743
Thank you. Both of you.

641
00:32:43,812 --> 00:32:45,712
For, you know,
getting past all of

642
00:32:45,798 --> 00:32:47,631
our stuff and seeing me through.

643
00:32:47,699 --> 00:32:50,867
And I just wanna take
this opportunity to say

644
00:32:50,936 --> 00:32:54,954
to hell with you and to
hell with you. I hate you.

645
00:32:55,023 --> 00:32:58,875
Both of you. And I hope I
never see you again. Bye.

646
00:33:00,229 --> 00:33:02,006
You called it. Yes, I did.

647
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:07,211
So, where's Wilson? I
mean, did she pass...

648
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:09,219
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

649
00:33:09,287 --> 00:33:10,787
Yes! Oh, my God!

650
00:33:10,855 --> 00:33:11,855
That's public.

651
00:33:14,726 --> 00:33:17,694
Oh, yeah. About time, Alex.

652
00:33:17,762 --> 00:33:19,957
So, Hopkins, right?
When are you going?

653
00:33:19,981 --> 00:33:21,598
Actually, I turned them down.

654
00:33:21,667 --> 00:33:23,232
No, Shane. No.

655
00:33:23,301 --> 00:33:26,169
There's still work to be
done on the Yang method.

656
00:33:26,238 --> 00:33:29,817
You're supposed to be starting
the Ross method or something.

657
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:32,075
I don't want you
giving up things for me.

658
00:33:32,127 --> 00:33:34,094
Conduit trial was
a huge success.

659
00:33:34,162 --> 00:33:36,563
And now you're on track to
becoming the first person ever

660
00:33:36,631 --> 00:33:38,931
to 3D print a
functioning human heart.

661
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,600
Hopkins can't give me that.

662
00:33:40,668 --> 00:33:42,085
They can't even come close.

663
00:33:43,605 --> 00:33:45,282
Well, since you put it that way.

664
00:33:45,306 --> 00:33:46,918
I'll see you tomorrow
morning. Yes, ma'am.

665
00:33:46,942 --> 00:33:47,942
Okay.

666
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:53,946
See that? So great.

667
00:33:55,016 --> 00:33:56,776
All right!

668
00:34:00,889 --> 00:34:02,666
Good

669
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:04,657
Good. Good.

670
00:34:04,726 --> 00:34:06,460
Yeah, slowly but surely.

671
00:34:06,528 --> 00:34:10,646
Just focus on your balance.

672
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:14,133
How does it feel,
Jase, to walk again?

673
00:34:14,202 --> 00:34:17,704
It's pretty good.

674
00:34:17,773 --> 00:34:19,573
Yeah, I think he
needs to concentrate.

675
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:25,278
It's amazing, in
just a few years?

676
00:34:25,347 --> 00:34:27,180
Unbelievable.

677
00:34:27,266 --> 00:34:29,510
Is Dr. Yang busy? I would
love for her to see this.

678
00:34:29,534 --> 00:34:31,083
Let me check, okay?

679
00:34:31,153 --> 00:34:33,153
Jason, are you all right?

680
00:34:33,955 --> 00:34:35,155
Jason!

681
00:34:36,658 --> 00:34:38,658
Get a crash cart! - Jason?

682
00:34:43,865 --> 00:34:44,997
Hey. I need you.

683
00:34:45,784 --> 00:34:46,950
Yes.

684
00:34:47,018 --> 00:34:48,418
No. I can't.

685
00:34:48,487 --> 00:34:50,687
These abstracts were
supposed to go out an hour ago.

686
00:34:50,722 --> 00:34:52,333
You know what? Okay.
On-call room, but fast?

687
00:34:52,357 --> 00:34:54,540
No, no, it's not...
It's Jason Castor.

688
00:34:54,609 --> 00:34:56,137
He just had an
accident in the BCI lab.

689
00:34:56,161 --> 00:34:58,344
He has rhabdo, renal failure.

690
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:03,049
Grey is putting a shunt in him,
but his wife's asking for you.

691
00:35:03,117 --> 00:35:06,019
Jason Castor, your
patient, the quadriplegic?

692
00:35:06,105 --> 00:35:07,987
We put him into
Derek and Callie's trial.

693
00:35:08,056 --> 00:35:10,535
His wife is... Oh!
Right, right, right. Yes.

694
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:11,936
Does he need a heart consult?

695
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:14,644
No, no. She's just scared,
and she trusts you...

696
00:35:14,712 --> 00:35:16,846
You know, Owen,
I have to finish this.

697
00:35:16,914 --> 00:35:18,259
I've got seven prints going.

698
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:19,549
Where's Ross?

699
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:20,857
Ross can't do this.

700
00:35:20,886 --> 00:35:24,206
I'm one step away from
funding for animal trials.

701
00:35:25,757 --> 00:35:27,635
Owen, he's not my
patient anymore.

702
00:35:27,659 --> 00:35:29,103
If the guy's heart is fine,

703
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:31,607
I don't have time to hold
someone's hand right now.

704
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:38,851
You know what? You
saved her husband's life.

705
00:35:38,921 --> 00:35:40,486
You were the first
doctor she met.

706
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:42,650
She likes you, she trusts you,
and now she's waiting for you.

707
00:35:42,674 --> 00:35:45,394
About a million heart
patients are waiting for me, too.

708
00:35:46,928 --> 00:35:48,862
Right.

709
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:51,030
You can't let people down.

710
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:00,457
Hey.

711
00:36:02,361 --> 00:36:03,793
Thanks.

712
00:36:03,862 --> 00:36:04,961
Um...

713
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:06,540
Was it because of the suit?

714
00:36:06,564 --> 00:36:09,132
No. His kidneys failed, and
that caused him to pass out.

715
00:36:09,201 --> 00:36:11,434
But the surgery is going well,

716
00:36:11,503 --> 00:36:13,370
and then we'll get
him on dialysis.

717
00:36:13,438 --> 00:36:18,708
This is just a complication
of Jason's condition.

718
00:36:18,776 --> 00:36:21,777
It's all just complications.

719
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:23,858
And he should be able to
continue with the study, so...

720
00:36:23,882 --> 00:36:25,048
He won't.

721
00:36:27,285 --> 00:36:29,030
Yeah, this will be his excuse,

722
00:36:29,054 --> 00:36:30,898
and he'll never forgive
me for making him do it.

723
00:36:30,922 --> 00:36:33,723
What? You didn't
make him do this.

724
00:36:33,792 --> 00:36:36,003
He told me once,
we were fighting,

725
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:38,322
and he told me that
when we woke him

726
00:36:38,346 --> 00:36:41,081
to ask him if he wanted to live,

727
00:36:41,149 --> 00:36:44,709
he only said yes because
he was looking at me,

728
00:36:44,736 --> 00:36:47,637
that if it had been up to him,

729
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:49,972
if I wasn't there,

730
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:52,209
he would have said no.

731
00:36:54,328 --> 00:36:55,806
So all this is because of me.

732
00:36:55,830 --> 00:36:57,474
I mean, he's miserable
every day because of me.

733
00:36:57,498 --> 00:36:59,677
And I'm not a wife anymore.

734
00:36:59,701 --> 00:37:02,663
I'm a nursemaid and
a cook and an orderly,

735
00:37:02,687 --> 00:37:04,765
and I never go
home from that work.

736
00:37:04,789 --> 00:37:08,291
I am that work. That's
all I am anymore.

737
00:37:13,865 --> 00:37:15,381
I wanted to have a child.

738
00:37:19,571 --> 00:37:22,021
And I will never,
ever have a child.

739
00:37:24,893 --> 00:37:26,960
I'm sorry.

740
00:37:27,029 --> 00:37:28,706
I'm being selfish and horrible.

741
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:31,214
No, you're not. No,
no, no. Not at all.

742
00:37:31,283 --> 00:37:33,199
Not at all. I
totally understand.

743
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:47,024
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

744
00:37:47,048 --> 00:37:48,848
No. It's okay.

745
00:37:49,818 --> 00:37:51,417
<i>Get on out!</i>

746
00:37:52,854 --> 00:37:55,454
<i>Okay, now, that is
a healthy heart sip</i>

747
00:37:55,524 --> 00:37:58,224
<i>that's both delicious
and nutritious.</i>

748
00:37:58,292 --> 00:38:00,493
<i>Thank you very much for that.</i>

749
00:38:00,562 --> 00:38:05,364
<i>Next up, I'm going
to debunk the top five</i>

750
00:38:05,433 --> 00:38:09,035
<i>biggest health myths for you
folks, coming up right after this.</i>

751
00:38:09,103 --> 00:38:12,238
She better include my
suggestion on too much calcium

752
00:38:12,306 --> 00:38:15,107
increasing your
risk of heart disease.

753
00:38:15,176 --> 00:38:17,544
People pop those
pills like candy.

754
00:38:20,949 --> 00:38:22,629
I haven't seen you in two days.

755
00:38:22,684 --> 00:38:24,529
Yeah, I took a couple
extra night shifts.

756
00:38:24,553 --> 00:38:26,233
I went by the
trailer this morning.

757
00:38:26,287 --> 00:38:28,888
Yeah, I just crashed
in the on-call room.

758
00:38:34,429 --> 00:38:35,879
Is something going on?

759
00:38:44,055 --> 00:38:47,306
I need more, Cristina. You know?

760
00:38:47,375 --> 00:38:50,076
I just can't keep...

761
00:38:50,145 --> 00:38:51,856
I just need more, you know.

762
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:54,998
More from you, more from us.

763
00:38:55,066 --> 00:38:57,700
- Another, please?
- You got it!

764
00:38:57,768 --> 00:38:59,280
Okay, let's just
get out of here.

765
00:38:59,304 --> 00:39:00,581
Nope.

766
00:39:00,605 --> 00:39:01,949
Let's go home.
Just sleep this off,

767
00:39:01,973 --> 00:39:03,301
and let's talk about it
in the morning, can we...

768
00:39:03,325 --> 00:39:05,758
We don't have a home, Cristina.

769
00:39:05,827 --> 00:39:08,789
I have a trailer, and you
have a room at Karev's house.

770
00:39:08,813 --> 00:39:10,313
It's not...

771
00:39:12,851 --> 00:39:14,851
- Another, please.
- Right up!

772
00:39:26,631 --> 00:39:28,831
There you go. Thank you.

773
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,512
There's too many.

774
00:39:31,536 --> 00:39:33,180
The kids outnumber the adults.

775
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:35,750
Should've thought of that
before we adopted again.

776
00:39:35,774 --> 00:39:38,619
I mean, what if there's a
mutiny? Derek and I will lose.

777
00:39:38,643 --> 00:39:41,310
Well, not until the
third one can walk.

778
00:39:42,614 --> 00:39:44,614
So, you broke up again?

779
00:39:47,652 --> 00:39:51,153
Same thing, over and over.

780
00:39:54,393 --> 00:39:57,927
You know what else is the same?

781
00:39:57,996 --> 00:40:00,630
This.

782
00:40:00,699 --> 00:40:05,001
You and I laying in this bed,
talking about you and Owen.

783
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:08,469
Why do you keep
doing this to yourself?

784
00:40:11,542 --> 00:40:13,042
I need help.

785
00:40:17,816 --> 00:40:19,065
Mer, you have to help me.

786
00:40:20,535 --> 00:40:22,652
Don't let me go back to him

787
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:25,321
for his good and mine.

788
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:27,039
Please help me.

789
00:40:27,108 --> 00:40:30,276
Of course. Of
course I'll help you.

790
00:40:50,198 --> 00:40:51,809
Morning, Grey. Morning.

791
00:40:51,833 --> 00:40:52,913
Hey.

792
00:40:56,204 --> 00:41:00,256
I look terrible in that green.

793
00:41:00,325 --> 00:41:03,326
I did not graduate
to my own show

794
00:41:03,394 --> 00:41:06,362
after two long years
on the local news

795
00:41:06,431 --> 00:41:09,982
just to look terrible in green.

796
00:41:10,051 --> 00:41:11,695
Any other notes? What are you...

797
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:14,820
No! Don't tell them
that. Tell them I love it.

798
00:41:15,257 --> 00:41:16,689
Great.

799
00:41:16,758 --> 00:41:17,790
The green or...

800
00:41:17,876 --> 00:41:19,075
The segment.

801
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:20,910
Right.

802
00:41:20,979 --> 00:41:22,339
Well, she's not gonna work out.

803
00:41:22,363 --> 00:41:25,098
So, what's tomorrow's topic?

804
00:41:25,166 --> 00:41:26,476
"What's hiding in your colon."

805
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:28,001
People really want to know that?

806
00:41:28,069 --> 00:41:29,919
Come do my show!

807
00:41:29,988 --> 00:41:31,765
I'm supposed to be
informing the public

808
00:41:31,789 --> 00:41:33,501
about the next big
thing in medicine,

809
00:41:33,525 --> 00:41:35,725
which is you.

810
00:41:35,794 --> 00:41:39,562
The Yang method saving
little babies left and right.

811
00:41:39,631 --> 00:41:40,874
Don't you wanna
come show the public

812
00:41:40,898 --> 00:41:42,059
how you're saving
the little babies?

813
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:44,066
Not my thing. You say that now.

814
00:41:44,135 --> 00:41:47,247
But there's perks to
being on TV. Two words.

815
00:41:47,271 --> 00:41:49,305
Gifting suite.

816
00:41:52,193 --> 00:41:54,755
They just hand
you stuff! For free!

817
00:41:54,779 --> 00:41:56,412
Is that real?

818
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,125
And your hand's
still not healed!

819
00:41:58,149 --> 00:42:00,199
You need more PT and
more time in the skills lab.

820
00:42:00,268 --> 00:42:01,867
You are not
stepping into that OR,

821
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:03,769
not today, maybe not ever!

822
00:42:03,838 --> 00:42:05,248
All right, first of all, you
need to lower your voice.

823
00:42:05,272 --> 00:42:07,372
Okay, so what,
nobody can yell at you?

824
00:42:07,441 --> 00:42:09,436
Why's that? Why is that?
Because you're an Avery?

825
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:10,938
That has nothing to do
with any of this, and you...

826
00:42:10,962 --> 00:42:13,224
Some pampered little rich
boy who was gifted a hospital,

827
00:42:13,248 --> 00:42:17,216
so he thinks that it's okay to
go ahead and endanger patients,

828
00:42:17,285 --> 00:42:20,153
'cause he's too damn proud to
admit that he can't operate anymore!

829
00:42:20,238 --> 00:42:21,303
Dr. Hunt!

830
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:32,014
This last month we've
admitted 470 patients to the ER.

831
00:42:32,083 --> 00:42:33,694
Thirty-seven of
those patients died,

832
00:42:33,718 --> 00:42:37,920
which puts our latest trauma
mortality rate at 7.9 percent.

833
00:42:37,989 --> 00:42:39,333
Well, that's higher
than the month before.

834
00:42:39,357 --> 00:42:41,202
Yeah. Well, more people
came through the doors.

835
00:42:41,226 --> 00:42:44,660
Listen, I've been reorganizing
the trauma rooms like you said.

836
00:42:44,729 --> 00:42:46,169
I... I'm trying the best I can.

837
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:47,942
Owen, you have to try harder.

838
00:42:47,966 --> 00:42:49,593
The board has been
very clear about this.

839
00:42:49,617 --> 00:42:51,061
If we don't get the number down,

840
00:42:51,085 --> 00:42:52,963
we're gonna lose
the state funding.

841
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:55,349
State funding is what's keeping
those trauma doors open.

842
00:42:55,373 --> 00:42:57,093
I understand. Owen.

843
00:42:57,141 --> 00:42:58,352
Chief, they need you in OR 3.

844
00:42:58,376 --> 00:42:59,553
I'll be right there.

845
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:00,697
Okay?

846
00:43:04,515 --> 00:43:08,033
Do you know how many infants
are born without a pulmonary artery?

847
00:43:08,102 --> 00:43:09,262
Cristina, I'm so sorry.

848
00:43:09,303 --> 00:43:11,115
But there is a
surgery to correct it.

849
00:43:11,139 --> 00:43:12,749
It's called unifocalization,

850
00:43:12,773 --> 00:43:14,918
which I was doing with a robot.

851
00:43:14,942 --> 00:43:16,237
But now Shane is finishing it

852
00:43:16,261 --> 00:43:18,239
because you paged me
"911" like a million times.

853
00:43:18,263 --> 00:43:19,440
So whatever it
is, it better be...

854
00:43:19,464 --> 00:43:20,512
It's Owen.

855
00:43:21,967 --> 00:43:24,028
He wanted to work a shift.
I didn't feel comfortable.

856
00:43:24,052 --> 00:43:26,172
He only agreed to get
in a bed if I paged you.

857
00:43:28,038 --> 00:43:29,522
Where is he?

858
00:43:30,958 --> 00:43:32,074
You came.

859
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:35,518
Give us a minute.

860
00:43:43,671 --> 00:43:45,449
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

861
00:43:45,473 --> 00:43:47,907
Oh, God, you stink.

862
00:43:49,343 --> 00:43:51,055
You tried to start a shift?

863
00:43:51,079 --> 00:43:53,462
Are you insane? You
could've hurt someone.

864
00:43:53,531 --> 00:43:56,983
Yeah. Yeah. I love you.

865
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:01,019
This has got to
stop. I love you.

866
00:44:01,089 --> 00:44:04,356
I love you. I love you,

867
00:44:04,425 --> 00:44:07,025
and I see you every day,

868
00:44:07,095 --> 00:44:08,789
and I can't have you.

869
00:44:08,813 --> 00:44:10,947
So...

870
00:44:11,015 --> 00:44:13,049
How am I supposed
to keep doing this,

871
00:44:13,117 --> 00:44:15,985
keep working here,

872
00:44:16,054 --> 00:44:18,554
when every time I turn around,

873
00:44:21,026 --> 00:44:22,074
I see your face?

874
00:44:22,643 --> 00:44:24,060
Owen...

875
00:44:25,596 --> 00:44:27,190
Owen, Owen, Owen, Owen...

876
00:44:27,214 --> 00:44:28,981
I love you. Please. Please.

877
00:44:29,050 --> 00:44:32,518
Please marry me. Just marry me.

878
00:44:32,587 --> 00:44:35,054
Owen... Why can't
you just marry me?

879
00:44:35,123 --> 00:44:37,272
Please, I'm begging
you. I'm begging.

880
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:38,824
I am begging you.

881
00:44:38,893 --> 00:44:40,704
I mean, we should
never have called it quits.

882
00:44:40,728 --> 00:44:45,131
We should never have called
it quits when we did. Please.

883
00:45:06,871 --> 00:45:08,582
Well, there's no
sign of him yet,

884
00:45:08,606 --> 00:45:09,750
but there's still
plenty of time,

885
00:45:09,774 --> 00:45:11,414
so there's no reason to panic.

886
00:45:11,442 --> 00:45:13,120
I'm not panicked. Okay.

887
00:45:13,144 --> 00:45:15,211
Can you get my belt? Sure.

888
00:45:19,917 --> 00:45:21,494
You look beautiful.

889
00:45:21,518 --> 00:45:23,119
Thanks.

890
00:45:23,187 --> 00:45:25,983
He is late. How could
he be late to this?

891
00:45:26,007 --> 00:45:28,007
I'll go look for him again.

892
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:36,243
Okay, we've got a
full house, people.

893
00:45:36,267 --> 00:45:37,766
Page anyone who's available.

894
00:45:37,835 --> 00:45:39,902
10-Year-old female,
thrown from a vehicle,

895
00:45:39,971 --> 00:45:42,722
multiple blunt injuries
and hypotensive.

896
00:45:42,790 --> 00:45:45,475
Hey, you, assess her, then
rush her up to radiology,

897
00:45:45,543 --> 00:45:47,288
get a CT with contrast. Uh-huh.

898
00:45:47,312 --> 00:45:48,822
Then page me as
soon as... Excuse me.

899
00:45:48,846 --> 00:45:50,557
Contrast, like the
iodine dye? Yeah.

900
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:52,993
I'm allergic to that. Do you
think my daughter could be, too?

901
00:45:53,017 --> 00:45:54,962
We'll run a test and check.

902
00:45:54,986 --> 00:45:56,530
Not a problem. Excuse me.

903
00:45:56,554 --> 00:45:57,787
What've you got?

904
00:46:03,911 --> 00:46:06,022
Do you want me
to call him again?

905
00:46:06,046 --> 00:46:07,496
No.

906
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:23,862
Do you have to take
that? 'Cause you can go.

907
00:46:23,931 --> 00:46:26,910
It's not like you haven't been
through this with me before.

908
00:46:26,934 --> 00:46:30,469
It's a general page,
for whoever's on call.

909
00:46:30,538 --> 00:46:33,105
I'm not even on call.
I'm not going anywhere.

910
00:46:38,362 --> 00:46:39,640
What happened?

911
00:46:39,664 --> 00:46:41,125
She was seizing,
severe allergic reaction.

912
00:46:41,149 --> 00:46:43,394
I was passing by and
saw this intern freaking out.

913
00:46:43,418 --> 00:46:45,484
I've given her a .3 EPI.

914
00:46:45,553 --> 00:46:46,981
Well, did anyone order contrast?

915
00:46:47,005 --> 00:46:48,198
Was she tested for allergies?

916
00:46:48,222 --> 00:46:49,700
I got paged. What's going on?

917
00:46:49,724 --> 00:46:51,619
We need to get her
to the OR immediately.

918
00:46:51,643 --> 00:46:54,377
Let's start her on
benadryl and steroids, stat!

919
00:46:54,429 --> 00:46:56,473
Is this your patient? - Yes.

920
00:46:56,497 --> 00:46:58,409
Why didn't you screen her
for any contrast allergies?

921
00:46:58,433 --> 00:46:59,710
I did. ARIZONA: It's not here.

922
00:46:59,734 --> 00:47:00,944
I mean, there's no
record of any tests.

923
00:47:00,968 --> 00:47:02,046
I ordered it. You did?

924
00:47:02,070 --> 00:47:03,663
Yes! Yes. You sure? You did?

925
00:47:03,687 --> 00:47:04,927
I ordered the damn test!

926
00:47:06,608 --> 00:47:07,639
Didn't I?

927
00:47:12,497 --> 00:47:14,308
Cutting it a little
close, don't you think?

928
00:47:14,332 --> 00:47:16,065
Hi. Sorry I'm late. I know.

929
00:47:16,133 --> 00:47:17,978
I got held up, and
there was traffic and...

930
00:47:18,002 --> 00:47:20,036
Anyway, sorry. I'm here now.

931
00:47:20,104 --> 00:47:22,287
You look incredible.

932
00:47:24,025 --> 00:47:25,741
Thank you.

933
00:47:25,810 --> 00:47:27,960
Well, shall we do this?

934
00:47:29,297 --> 00:47:31,013
Let's.

935
00:47:35,103 --> 00:47:37,014
This is unacceptable.

936
00:47:37,038 --> 00:47:38,548
Things like this keep happening,

937
00:47:38,572 --> 00:47:40,117
and this time there
was a kid involved.

938
00:47:40,141 --> 00:47:42,452
And I'm not looking the
other way any longer.

939
00:47:42,476 --> 00:47:44,387
He's unreliable, a
danger to his patients.

940
00:47:44,411 --> 00:47:45,889
I mean...

941
00:47:47,115 --> 00:47:50,249
Did you smell his breath?

942
00:47:50,318 --> 00:47:52,296
Yeah, well, let's just wait
for the breathalyzer results.

943
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:55,365
No. We need to convene
an emergency board meeting.

944
00:47:55,389 --> 00:47:58,029
Right now, Derek. Right now.

945
00:48:04,615 --> 00:48:06,999
She's a pioneer, an inspiration,

946
00:48:07,067 --> 00:48:08,707
a mentor, and, I'm proud to say,

947
00:48:08,736 --> 00:48:12,238
my friend for over 15 years.

948
00:48:12,306 --> 00:48:15,774
Please welcome, for an
unprecedented fourth consecutive year,

949
00:48:15,843 --> 00:48:18,177
tonight's Harper
Avery Award recipient,

950
00:48:18,246 --> 00:48:19,461
Dr. Cristina Yang.

951
00:48:25,469 --> 00:48:26,719
What's going on?

952
00:48:26,788 --> 00:48:28,065
It's not a matter
of loyalty anymore.

953
00:48:28,089 --> 00:48:29,633
Look, what he needs
right now is our support.

954
00:48:29,657 --> 00:48:31,234
Believe me, I know.

955
00:48:31,258 --> 00:48:33,270
I came as soon as I could.

956
00:48:33,294 --> 00:48:35,360
You know he's just
sitting out there waiting?

957
00:48:35,429 --> 00:48:37,107
April, you run the
trauma department.

958
00:48:37,131 --> 00:48:39,009
You work with him more
closely than anybody else.

959
00:48:39,033 --> 00:48:42,935
Do you trust Owen
Hunt to treat patients?

960
00:48:43,004 --> 00:48:45,971
He is my mentor,
and he trained me.

961
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:47,517
We value your opinion, April.

962
00:48:47,541 --> 00:48:49,019
That's why you're here.

963
00:48:49,043 --> 00:48:51,243
Just be honest.

964
00:48:51,312 --> 00:48:53,478
Do you trust the man?

965
00:49:04,491 --> 00:49:07,459
No, I don't.

966
00:49:07,528 --> 00:49:10,312
I move to terminate him,
effective immediately.

967
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:13,082
If there's one thing I've
learned over the years,

968
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:18,187
it's that it only takes one
person, one patient, one moment,

969
00:49:18,255 --> 00:49:20,922
to change your life forever.

970
00:49:20,992 --> 00:49:25,427
To change your perspective,
color your thinking,

971
00:49:25,496 --> 00:49:30,115
to force you to re-evaluate
everything you think you know.

972
00:49:30,184 --> 00:49:34,070
<i>To make you ask yourself
the toughest questions.</i>

973
00:49:35,589 --> 00:49:37,156
Do you know who you are?

974
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:42,094
<i>Do you understand what
has happened to you?</i>

975
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:45,664
Do you want to live this way?

976
00:49:49,237 --> 00:49:52,020
<i>I'm sorry, but I have
to ask one more time.</i>

977
00:49:53,007 --> 00:49:55,440
Jason,

978
00:49:55,509 --> 00:49:57,476
would you like me
to remove the vent?

979
00:50:15,446 --> 00:50:17,446
Okay.

980
00:50:58,206 --> 00:50:59,206
Hey, watch your hand.

981
00:51:00,224 --> 00:51:02,341
Thanks. No problem.

982
00:51:07,114 --> 00:51:09,231
Hey, Cristina.
Hey. You got a sec?

983
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:10,911
I could use a set of
eyes on my patient.

984
00:51:10,935 --> 00:51:12,367
Yeah. Just give me one...

985
00:51:17,191 --> 00:51:19,311
Never mind. What do you got?
