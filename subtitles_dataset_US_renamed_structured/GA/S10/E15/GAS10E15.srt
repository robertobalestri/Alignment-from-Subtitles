1
00:00:10,527 --> 00:00:12,207
<i>You know your tailbone?</i>

2
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,867
<i>It used to be a tail.</i>

3
00:00:24,608 --> 00:00:26,358
Sofia!

4
00:00:26,427 --> 00:00:28,347
<i>That pink part in the
corner of your eye?</i>

5
00:00:29,296 --> 00:00:31,262
<i>It used to be a third eyelid.</i>

6
00:00:31,331 --> 00:00:33,731
Skull is cracked. They said
he went through the windshield?

7
00:00:33,767 --> 00:00:34,810
V-tach. No pulse!

8
00:00:36,086 --> 00:00:38,604
Paddles! Charge to 100!

9
00:00:38,672 --> 00:00:39,988
Donald Mercer.

10
00:00:40,074 --> 00:00:42,474
<i>The appendix used to
help us digest tough foods.</i>

11
00:00:43,277 --> 00:00:45,110
<i>Now it does nothing.</i>

12
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:46,219
Clear!

13
00:00:48,999 --> 00:00:52,400
<i>The story of our evolution</i>

14
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:55,270
<i>is the story of what
we leave behind,</i>

15
00:00:56,406 --> 00:00:58,040
<i>what we've discarded.</i>

16
00:01:00,678 --> 00:01:02,243
Oh!

17
00:01:03,314 --> 00:01:04,479
Uh, explain, please.

18
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:06,325
Oh, sofia got fruit
juice all over it.

19
00:01:06,349 --> 00:01:08,461
And, as you know, she could
fry the microprocessor in here.

20
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:10,664
Now I'm gonna be late. And I've
told her not to play with my leg!

21
00:01:10,688 --> 00:01:13,939
Uh, no, you haven't
actually, ever.

22
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:17,726
Hey, um, I found these.
Um, where should I put them?

23
00:01:17,794 --> 00:01:18,794
What?

24
00:01:19,814 --> 00:01:21,313
Your wheelie sneaks.

25
00:01:21,382 --> 00:01:22,531
Oh. Trash.

26
00:01:24,134 --> 00:01:25,879
Really? Yeah. Callie, it's fine.

27
00:01:25,903 --> 00:01:27,397
<i>Our bodies only hang on</i>

28
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:28,865
<i>to the things we
absolutely need.</i>

29
00:01:28,889 --> 00:01:29,889
<i>Clear!</i>

30
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:33,569
Okay, I've got a
rhythm. I got a pulse.

31
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:34,709
Wait.

32
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:39,564
<i>The things we no
longer have use for...</i>

33
00:01:39,633 --> 00:01:41,866
No pupillary response,
no pain response,

34
00:01:41,936 --> 00:01:44,936
visible brain matter, no
evidence of brain activity.

35
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:48,385
- I think we lost him.
<i>- We give up...</i>

36
00:01:48,409 --> 00:01:50,469
Maybe there's a mistake, please.

37
00:01:50,493 --> 00:01:52,160
I need to see him.

38
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:54,246
<i>We let go.</i>

39
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:56,760
Jared Cole, suffered
Byler's disease since birth,

40
00:01:56,784 --> 00:01:59,901
complains of increasing
jaundice, edema, frequent fevers...

41
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:01,781
So his condition has
gotten much worse.

42
00:02:01,805 --> 00:02:03,249
And if the bile
continues to build up,

43
00:02:03,273 --> 00:02:05,936
then we're looking at
cirrhosis or possible liver failure.

44
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:09,172
He has to go on the
list now, for a transplant?

45
00:02:09,196 --> 00:02:12,414
We have one more chance to
avoid it, uh, a diversion procedure.

46
00:02:12,482 --> 00:02:14,132
We'll take a piece
of his intestine

47
00:02:14,201 --> 00:02:16,295
and create a detour for the bile
to drain out through his abdomen.

48
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:17,814
I'll have a hole in my stomach?

49
00:02:17,838 --> 00:02:19,816
I know, that sounds weird.

50
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,372
But it's our best shot

51
00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:23,519
so that you don't feel like
you're getting sick all the time

52
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:25,472
and so you don't look
like an Oompa Loompa.

53
00:02:25,496 --> 00:02:26,878
Does that sound good?

54
00:02:28,365 --> 00:02:32,150
Sweetie, the doctor
asked you a question.

55
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:33,752
Are you a robot?

56
00:02:33,804 --> 00:02:35,687
Jared Cole, manners!

57
00:02:35,756 --> 00:02:37,405
I am so sorry.

58
00:02:37,474 --> 00:02:39,152
No, no. That's a valid question.

59
00:02:39,176 --> 00:02:40,609
No, I'm not a robot.

60
00:02:40,677 --> 00:02:42,277
I'm almost that cool.

61
00:02:42,346 --> 00:02:43,790
I got into an accident
and I lost my leg.

62
00:02:43,814 --> 00:02:45,841
And then they gave me a new one.

63
00:02:45,865 --> 00:02:47,832
Can you jump super-high?

64
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:49,301
No.

65
00:02:50,454 --> 00:02:52,904
See you in there.

66
00:02:52,957 --> 00:02:54,534
After all he's been through,

67
00:02:54,558 --> 00:02:55,802
we gotta cut up his
perfectly healthy intestine

68
00:02:55,826 --> 00:02:57,609
and put a hole in his belly?

69
00:02:57,678 --> 00:02:59,005
Hey, you saw his
bilirubin. He's out of options.

70
00:02:59,029 --> 00:03:00,874
Wilson, go check on his
coags before we go to surgery.

71
00:03:00,898 --> 00:03:02,142
You're gonna need to
assign someone else.

72
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:03,209
Wilson's no longer in peds.

73
00:03:03,233 --> 00:03:04,383
What? Why?

74
00:03:04,451 --> 00:03:05,350
You, you're suspended
from surgery.

75
00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:06,768
What?

76
00:03:06,837 --> 00:03:08,698
You broke the
non-fraternization rule.

77
00:03:08,722 --> 00:03:10,350
And it was just gonna be
a slap on the wrist, Karev,

78
00:03:10,374 --> 00:03:11,684
until you decided to
give the board the finger.

79
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:14,309
Three days, no
surgery. Wilson, the ER.

80
00:03:14,378 --> 00:03:15,711
I have my Byler's kid.

81
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:16,856
You're gonna let this rule
mess with patient care?

82
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,858
Robbins can take that case.

83
00:03:18,882 --> 00:03:21,666
Thanks. Makes my day real easy.

84
00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:25,203
Well, I'm afraid it's
about to get harder.

85
00:03:25,272 --> 00:03:27,417
HR wants to talk
to you today. HR?

86
00:03:27,441 --> 00:03:28,851
The anonymous
harassment complaint

87
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,115
came from Leah Murphy.

88
00:03:31,345 --> 00:03:32,521
Oh, God. Yeah.

89
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:34,424
And, legally, HR
has to investigate,

90
00:03:34,448 --> 00:03:36,092
and they want you to
answer some questions.

91
00:03:36,116 --> 00:03:38,036
And that might be the
end of it. And if it's not?

92
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:42,364
I have no time for this today.

93
00:03:42,423 --> 00:03:44,663
No contact with Murphy, okay?

94
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,337
Hey, Derek! Are you
coming by the lab today?

95
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:50,223
We're starting to lose all
our phase-two momentum.

96
00:03:50,247 --> 00:03:51,991
Yeah. Actually, they're
setting up my new office today.

97
00:03:52,015 --> 00:03:54,010
Oh, you know what?
I got to grab a sensor.

98
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:55,745
The guys are going
to duplicate one. Yes.

99
00:03:55,769 --> 00:03:57,869
The Washington
guys, mappin' the brain.

100
00:03:57,937 --> 00:03:59,966
You're actually gonna have
time to do this, too, though, right?

101
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,517
Yeah. I hope so. I plan to.

102
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:03,219
All right. Well, let me
know when you're ready.

103
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,743
"Oh, yeah. Call
me. We'll hang out."

104
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:08,091
I haven't seen a blowoff
like that since high school.

105
00:04:08,115 --> 00:04:09,726
It was not a blowoff. Okay.

106
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,227
I have nothing against Ross.

107
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,585
I just don't think he
should be on my service.

108
00:04:13,654 --> 00:04:16,098
Look, he needs to feel
that he has your support.

109
00:04:16,122 --> 00:04:17,333
He's trying to find his footing.

110
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:18,617
I know, and I think
he lost it because

111
00:04:18,641 --> 00:04:21,292
I was not the best influence.

112
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:24,345
Also, we had...

113
00:04:24,414 --> 00:04:27,198
inappropriate...
Shenanigans. I know.

114
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,112
That's what the
rule is for, Dr. Yang,

115
00:04:29,136 --> 00:04:30,964
so we can work together
without the shenanigans.

116
00:04:30,988 --> 00:04:33,088
I think it's a bad idea, sir,

117
00:04:33,156 --> 00:04:34,476
and I think the Chief will, too.

118
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:37,091
Huh.

119
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,772
Well, the Chief asked me
to keep an eye on Ross.

120
00:04:39,796 --> 00:04:41,290
So it's my call, not his.

121
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:43,125
And as far as you're
concerned, Dr. Yang,

122
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:46,351
I am still and will
always be the chief.

123
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:48,903
Yes, sir.

124
00:04:52,776 --> 00:04:54,776
Sorry...

125
00:04:54,844 --> 00:04:57,945
About what I said. I
was a complete jerk.

126
00:05:03,387 --> 00:05:04,703
I heard you got busted.

127
00:05:04,755 --> 00:05:05,954
Yep.

128
00:05:06,022 --> 00:05:07,633
I have to miss out
on my education

129
00:05:07,657 --> 00:05:09,769
so they can keep me on
a separate floor from Alex.

130
00:05:09,793 --> 00:05:11,509
See, I want that rule.

131
00:05:11,578 --> 00:05:13,389
If I find myself alone
in a room with Jackson,

132
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:14,896
I'm afraid I'm gonna
nut-punch him.

133
00:05:14,965 --> 00:05:17,598
So every time he has a
consult in the ER today,

134
00:05:17,667 --> 00:05:19,301
I'm taking a break.

135
00:05:19,369 --> 00:05:20,769
You shouldn't.

136
00:05:20,837 --> 00:05:24,573
You should nut-punch him.
We'd all want to see that.

137
00:05:27,044 --> 00:05:28,843
He married her, Jo.

138
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:30,745
One day, he's with me,

139
00:05:30,814 --> 00:05:33,214
the next day, he's not
just with her, she's his wife.

140
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:38,136
So, what the hell was I all
that time, that he could just

141
00:05:38,205 --> 00:05:40,238
toss me aside like garbage?

142
00:05:44,428 --> 00:05:45,727
Oh, my God.

143
00:05:45,795 --> 00:05:46,940
<i>It was right outside...</i>

144
00:05:46,964 --> 00:05:48,646
By the dumpsters.

145
00:05:48,715 --> 00:05:49,792
He's warm, pulse is
weak. He's breathing fast.

146
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:50,915
Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh!

147
00:05:50,984 --> 00:05:52,300
Hey, little one. How are you?

148
00:05:52,386 --> 00:05:55,486
What are you, like eight
months, nine months?

149
00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:58,506
Oh, what do we have here?
You've had some surgeries before.

150
00:05:58,574 --> 00:06:00,334
Okay. Let's get him
up into the PICU.

151
00:06:01,795 --> 00:06:03,373
Uh, I'll get a peds gurney.

152
00:06:03,397 --> 00:06:05,147
So, page cardio
and call the police.

153
00:06:05,232 --> 00:06:06,948
Get prints, any
identifying marks,

154
00:06:07,017 --> 00:06:08,900
find out if he was
born here, seen here.

155
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:11,088
We're gonna find out
who this little guy is.

156
00:06:11,921 --> 00:06:13,371
Oh! Oh! Oh!

157
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,552
I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!

158
00:06:15,576 --> 00:06:16,975
Are you okay?

159
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,803
Oh, I think you broke my leg.

160
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,406
Oh! Oh, my God!

161
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:21,512
It's all right.

162
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:23,998
I have another
one in my car. Oh.

163
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:37,379
What happened? Oh, I'm fine.

164
00:06:37,447 --> 00:06:39,497
I was walking, and...
What happened?

165
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:42,401
I'm fine! I had an
accident, my leg got broken,

166
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:44,319
and someone's bringing
me a spare. I'm fine.

167
00:06:44,388 --> 00:06:45,804
Oh, God! I'm sorry!

168
00:06:45,873 --> 00:06:47,333
I got it. I got the leg. Uh-huh.

169
00:06:47,357 --> 00:06:50,086
Oh, Dr. Robbins, I am so
sorry. Edwards, you know what?

170
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:52,670
You should go page cardio and
then go do a work-up on the baby.

171
00:06:53,013 --> 00:06:54,279
I'll go with her.

172
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:55,808
Whoa, Wilson, what baby?

173
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:57,048
We found a baby in the trash.

174
00:06:57,116 --> 00:06:58,144
No, you're not
doing the work-up.

175
00:06:58,168 --> 00:06:59,396
But it's my dumpster baby!

176
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:00,980
You're not on peds. I
have a patient for you.

177
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:02,203
Oh, Bailey,

178
00:07:02,272 --> 00:07:03,949
I have a Byler's biliary
diversion surgery today,

179
00:07:03,973 --> 00:07:05,533
and I lost Karev,
so can you assist?

180
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:06,825
You got it!

181
00:07:07,694 --> 00:07:10,195
Okay, everybody out. Please.

182
00:07:10,264 --> 00:07:11,563
Oh.

183
00:07:11,632 --> 00:07:12,998
Hey. Are you okay?

184
00:07:13,066 --> 00:07:14,365
Hey.

185
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:17,051
Yeah, my neck's a little
sore, and my leg is totaled.

186
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,181
Oh, geez. Now I have
to wear my old beater leg.

187
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:20,750
I thought you said
this chafes you.

188
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:22,485
Well, it's better than nothing
until my other one's fixed.

189
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:24,392
All right. Here.

190
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:26,805
Oh, um, can you make it
to round on Alyssa Cramer?

191
00:07:26,829 --> 00:07:27,973
The club-feet girl? She's back?

192
00:07:27,997 --> 00:07:29,480
Yeah, scar revision.

193
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:32,767
Oh, yeah. Okay. Hey, um,
listen. HR wants to talk to me.

194
00:07:32,836 --> 00:07:34,102
Mmm-hmm.

195
00:07:34,171 --> 00:07:36,404
The anonymous harassment
claim came from Leah Murphy.

196
00:07:42,863 --> 00:07:45,096
All right. You good here?

197
00:07:45,865 --> 00:07:46,998
Yeah. Thank you.

198
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:48,883
Mmm-hmm.

199
00:07:48,952 --> 00:07:50,747
<i>I understand
that I broke a rule,</i>

200
00:07:50,771 --> 00:07:52,882
but I don't think it's fair for
this to affect my education.

201
00:07:52,906 --> 00:07:54,984
You spend more time on
peds than any other service.

202
00:07:55,008 --> 00:07:56,218
Because I'm interested in peds!

203
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:57,353
Yeah, well, I'm interested

204
00:07:57,377 --> 00:07:58,655
in giving you a
well-rounded education.

205
00:07:58,679 --> 00:08:01,079
So today, you're on trauma,
and this is your patient.

206
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:03,587
Mr. Donald Mercer
is an organ donor.

207
00:08:03,617 --> 00:08:05,945
He was injured in
an MVC this morning.

208
00:08:05,969 --> 00:08:09,587
We're waiting the six hours to
confirm the diagnosis of brain death.

209
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:11,267
Okay. Now, you
will make sure that

210
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:13,452
his organs are in optimum
condition for donation,

211
00:08:13,476 --> 00:08:15,588
and then you will get to
scrub in on the organ recovery.

212
00:08:15,612 --> 00:08:16,822
You got it? But that's like

213
00:08:16,846 --> 00:08:18,524
six surgeries in one! Mmm-hmm.

214
00:08:18,548 --> 00:08:19,843
Trauma's not so bad now, huh?

215
00:08:19,867 --> 00:08:20,882
So sorry.

216
00:08:22,219 --> 00:08:24,236
She's filled out all
the donor paperwork.

217
00:08:24,304 --> 00:08:25,848
She just wants a couple
minutes with him before

218
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:27,483
she starts making
arrangements. Of course.

219
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,836
Excuse me, uh, Doctor?
This isn't the right time for this,

220
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:31,893
I'm sure. I mean,
there probably isn't one.

221
00:08:31,962 --> 00:08:33,139
But I feel like it can't wait.

222
00:08:33,163 --> 00:08:34,445
How can we help?

223
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,626
Donnie had a kidney
transplant about four months ago.

224
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:38,111
Yeah, we knew about
that. That was me.

225
00:08:38,135 --> 00:08:41,469
I donated my kidney
for him. Wow. That's...

226
00:08:41,538 --> 00:08:42,899
He was lucky to
have friends like you.

227
00:08:42,923 --> 00:08:46,374
He was. Yeah. Uh,
amazing. So, um...

228
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:48,810
I was wondering,
about the kidney.

229
00:08:49,479 --> 00:08:50,528
Can I get that back?

230
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:57,268
Yeah, I can see you. I don't
know why you can't see me.

231
00:08:57,337 --> 00:08:58,953
But we're still
setting up here, so...

232
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:01,320
<i>Yes. So, then you did
get all the proposals?</i>

233
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:02,374
Um...

234
00:09:04,894 --> 00:09:08,979
Uh, yeah. Yep. Yep. They're
right here. <i>Great, great.</i>

235
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:11,744
<i>And, um, you're sending us a
prototype of your asymmetrical sensor?</i>

236
00:09:11,768 --> 00:09:14,029
Yeah, sending it out today.
<i>Thank you. Thank you so much.</i>

237
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:16,354
<i>And, obviously,
discontinue any other work</i>

238
00:09:16,423 --> 00:09:17,834
<i>you'll be doing
with the sensors,</i>

239
00:09:17,858 --> 00:09:20,358
<i>and I will e-mail you a
release for the patent.</i>

240
00:09:20,427 --> 00:09:22,109
Wait, I'm sorry, "Discontinue"?

241
00:09:22,179 --> 00:09:24,162
My work with
Dr. Torres is ongoing.

242
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:27,732
<i>Uh, well, not with your sensors.</i>

243
00:09:27,801 --> 00:09:30,568
<i>They have to be proprietary
to the work that we're doing.</i>

244
00:09:30,637 --> 00:09:34,055
<i>Our NIH grant is dependent
on that. You understand?</i>

245
00:09:34,124 --> 00:09:35,740
I'm not sure Dr. Torres will.

246
00:09:35,809 --> 00:09:38,359
And I have to say,
Lloyd, I don't like it.

247
00:09:38,427 --> 00:09:40,061
<i>Uh, well, I'm, uh...</i>

248
00:09:40,129 --> 00:09:41,395
<i>I'm sorry, Derek,</i>

249
00:09:41,464 --> 00:09:43,598
<i>but it's pretty clear
from our agreement,</i>

250
00:09:43,667 --> 00:09:46,200
<i>we and the NIH hired you,</i>

251
00:09:46,269 --> 00:09:48,269
<i>and your sensors come with you.</i>

252
00:09:55,996 --> 00:09:58,696
Oh, hey, little guy.
What do we know?

253
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:02,049
He's had a median sternotomy,
a couple of chest tubes.

254
00:10:02,118 --> 00:10:05,958
Low sats, high BP, failure to
thrive. Have you cuddled him?

255
00:10:06,006 --> 00:10:07,338
No, I have not.

256
00:10:07,407 --> 00:10:08,851
Well, if I were left
in a cardboard box,

257
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:10,352
all I'd want is cuddling, right?

258
00:10:10,376 --> 00:10:11,838
Oh, I think I'd
want a cardiac cath

259
00:10:11,862 --> 00:10:13,656
to confirm I've had a
coarctation of my aorta.

260
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,682
He is like a puzzle that I can't
solve... If you're gonna do that...

261
00:10:17,734 --> 00:10:20,168
Do you have a coarctation
of your aorta? Do you?

262
00:10:20,237 --> 00:10:22,147
No record of the baby
being a former patient.

263
00:10:22,171 --> 00:10:24,349
The police are getting statements
from Edwards and Wilson.

264
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:25,701
Ooh!

265
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:26,825
God, sorry.

266
00:10:26,893 --> 00:10:28,187
Um, I have a patient,
so will you call me

267
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:29,606
when you're done with
his cath? Mmm-hmm.

268
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,573
Ross, you want to take
the baby? I'd rather not.

269
00:10:31,597 --> 00:10:33,198
Ross, take the baby. Come here.

270
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:34,999
Are you squeaking?

271
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:36,083
Long story.

272
00:10:37,454 --> 00:10:38,664
Can I put him down now?

273
00:10:38,688 --> 00:10:40,082
No. She's right. He
should be cuddled.

274
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:42,340
You're not gonna hurt
him. And I don't want to do it.

275
00:10:55,255 --> 00:10:58,189
Did I hear you found a baby?

276
00:10:58,258 --> 00:11:00,141
Yes. In a box, abandoned.

277
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:01,870
Oh, is it all right?
I don't know.

278
00:11:01,894 --> 00:11:03,238
I imagine it's
pretty traumatized,

279
00:11:03,262 --> 00:11:04,963
having been
suddenly left behind,

280
00:11:05,032 --> 00:11:06,309
thrown aside... Stephanie...

281
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:07,999
dumped, as it
were, in the trash.

282
00:11:08,068 --> 00:11:09,461
Would you please let me talk?

283
00:11:09,485 --> 00:11:11,719
You really want to
get out of my way.

284
00:11:17,811 --> 00:11:19,655
Three days I'm
suspended from surgery.

285
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,924
You bang a co-worker, and
you get a house and two kids.

286
00:11:21,948 --> 00:11:23,826
I do it and I get suspended.

287
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,684
I know. I'm a
hypocrite, I've heard.

288
00:11:25,752 --> 00:11:28,213
I'm supposed to do a
biliary diversion. I like this kid.

289
00:11:28,237 --> 00:11:29,448
I've been treating
him for years.

290
00:11:29,472 --> 00:11:30,616
I want to make
sure it's done right.

291
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,084
But do me a favor. Talk to Hunt.

292
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:33,920
See if he'll start my
stupid sentence tomorrow.

293
00:11:33,944 --> 00:11:36,088
I will. I'm gonna talk
to him. Thank you.

294
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:37,756
You're a hypocrite and you suck!

295
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,392
Hey, did you hear, uh, Grumpy

296
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:41,016
and Hairball found
a baby in the trash?

297
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:43,162
Emma Marling came by
to get a key for the trailer.

298
00:11:43,186 --> 00:11:44,329
Why are you telling me this?

299
00:11:44,353 --> 00:11:45,398
It's gossip. I'm gossiping.

300
00:11:45,422 --> 00:11:47,021
Oh, okay. Shoot.

301
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:49,052
To get her things because
her and Owen are through.

302
00:11:49,076 --> 00:11:50,936
Through? Why? I don't
know. She didn't say.

303
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,795
But I don't think
it was her idea.

304
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:58,127
I can't tell if you're
happy or sad.

305
00:11:58,151 --> 00:11:59,617
Neither can I.

306
00:11:59,685 --> 00:12:01,597
<i>It hurts like a bitch, Dad!</i>

307
00:12:01,621 --> 00:12:02,803
Don't talk like that!

308
00:12:02,872 --> 00:12:04,150
Don't talk to me
like I'm a baby!

309
00:12:04,174 --> 00:12:06,018
We've gone over this and...
- Hey! Hey!

310
00:12:06,042 --> 00:12:09,009
Hey, Alyssa. Herb.
Guys, what's going on?

311
00:12:09,078 --> 00:12:11,540
We're just gonna do another
stupid surgery, and I'll still be in pain.

312
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:12,808
- Simmer down.
- No, no. I know.

313
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:14,243
Your arthrogryposis
symptoms are worsening,

314
00:12:14,267 --> 00:12:17,001
but today's surgery
will alleviate the scarring

315
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,403
and hopefully the pain, too.

316
00:12:18,472 --> 00:12:20,299
You said that before
my last surgery.

317
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:21,539
I know.

318
00:12:21,607 --> 00:12:23,553
And the one before that
and the one before that!

319
00:12:23,577 --> 00:12:25,988
Stop it. They are trying to help
you! You keep lying to me about...

320
00:12:26,012 --> 00:12:29,580
I have had braces and castings
and surgeries, and none of it works!

321
00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:31,515
So, I want to know... Don't.

322
00:12:31,585 --> 00:12:33,785
If you can just cut them off.

323
00:12:34,404 --> 00:12:37,087
Just give me the fake legs.

324
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:39,076
Then I can still do all
the stuff I want to do.

325
00:12:39,126 --> 00:12:40,853
Yeah, she's been talking
like this for a month now.

326
00:12:40,877 --> 00:12:43,193
Please tell her that I am
not gonna allow anybody...

327
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:45,296
What? Disable me?

328
00:12:45,364 --> 00:12:48,166
Dad, I am disabled
now! I still can't walk!

329
00:12:48,235 --> 00:12:49,962
It hurts when I stand for
more than three minutes.

330
00:12:49,986 --> 00:12:52,331
I'll never run! It hurts
when I try to sleep!

331
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:54,150
Tell her she's being
ridiculous. You are!

332
00:12:54,174 --> 00:12:56,052
She won't talk to me.
I live in a bed, Dad,

333
00:12:56,076 --> 00:12:57,737
and there are girls running
marathons with fake legs!

334
00:12:57,761 --> 00:12:59,243
Alyssa.

335
00:13:01,014 --> 00:13:04,965
It has. It has been a long
road. Look at how long.

336
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:11,221
And I know. I know it hurts.

337
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,852
And it feels like you
can't go any further,

338
00:13:12,876 --> 00:13:14,642
but this is the time
you have to be brave

339
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:16,728
and push through
it and have faith.

340
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:19,330
Even if it's not working yet,

341
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:21,232
it's going to work.

342
00:13:22,419 --> 00:13:23,651
Right?

343
00:13:24,938 --> 00:13:27,098
I'm not so sure about that.

344
00:13:36,632 --> 00:13:39,245
I cannot believe that you
didn't back me up in there.

345
00:13:39,269 --> 00:13:41,113
I mean, a kid wants
to cut off her legs!

346
00:13:41,137 --> 00:13:43,315
I'm just suggesting that you
don't dismiss it out of hand.

347
00:13:43,339 --> 00:13:44,383
Hey, Callie, you got a minute?

348
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:45,467
Something kind of
unexpected came up.

349
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:46,891
Hold on a sec. Really?

350
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,638
Because it sounds to me like
you're asking me to just throw away

351
00:13:48,662 --> 00:13:49,855
three years' worth of hard work

352
00:13:49,879 --> 00:13:51,395
and investment in this girl,

353
00:13:51,464 --> 00:13:52,675
just cut it off and throw it
away like it never happened.

354
00:13:52,699 --> 00:13:54,481
And I don't want to do that.

355
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:56,495
I'm sorry, Derek. What is it?

356
00:13:56,519 --> 00:13:58,536
Nothing. I'm good.

357
00:14:00,156 --> 00:14:02,890
Somebody tried to
fix his coarctation.

358
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:04,659
Did a hack job.

359
00:14:04,728 --> 00:14:06,706
Look, it's closing up already.

360
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:08,841
Um, I'm going to reopen, um...

361
00:14:08,865 --> 00:14:11,149
Prep a balloon catheter.

362
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:13,985
Did you notice anything
about his mitral valve?

363
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:15,068
I don't know.

364
00:14:15,138 --> 00:14:18,473
Shane, come on.
This is like a puzzle.

365
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:20,920
I found the corner pieces.
I need help with the sky.

366
00:14:20,944 --> 00:14:24,162
The valve leaflets were
thickened and shortened.

367
00:14:24,231 --> 00:14:25,879
A parachute mitral valve?

368
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:28,878
Yes. And there's a
supravalvular mitral ring.

369
00:14:28,902 --> 00:14:30,112
The three indicate...

370
00:14:30,136 --> 00:14:31,769
Coarctation,

371
00:14:31,837 --> 00:14:36,173
supravalvular mitral
ring and parachute...

372
00:14:36,243 --> 00:14:37,342
Shone's Complex?

373
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:38,576
Bingo.

374
00:14:38,645 --> 00:14:42,024
A trifecta of congenital
heart defects.

375
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:44,076
That answers another
question. What?

376
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,866
Why they abandoned him.

377
00:14:45,935 --> 00:14:48,869
The kid had one heart surgery.
He needed at least two more.

378
00:14:48,938 --> 00:14:51,538
Someone thought he was
more trouble than he's worth.

379
00:14:55,795 --> 00:14:57,807
What are you doing
here? Go away.

380
00:14:57,831 --> 00:14:59,191
What are you doing? Organ donor.

381
00:14:59,215 --> 00:15:01,577
I have to keep him alive
until he's actually dead.

382
00:15:01,601 --> 00:15:04,202
Nice. I'm off peds, and Hunt's
got you arranging a meat platter.

383
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,414
I know. But I'm gonna show him.

384
00:15:05,438 --> 00:15:07,082
I'm gonna keep his
organs so healthy,

385
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:08,684
someone could use his appendix.

386
00:15:10,259 --> 00:15:11,125
You should go. If Hunt
shows up, he's gonna...

387
00:15:11,194 --> 00:15:13,294
We could use his appendix.

388
00:15:13,363 --> 00:15:16,480
It was a joke. We don't
donate... No, that could work.

389
00:15:16,533 --> 00:15:19,250
Karev, don't make me
turn three days into a week.

390
00:15:19,319 --> 00:15:20,746
Did I get too close to Wilson?

391
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:22,890
Did an alarm go off somewhere?

392
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:28,843
But it's a donor organ,
so it can't be regifted.

393
00:15:28,911 --> 00:15:30,639
I don't understand,
though. It's mine.

394
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:33,580
Yes. Yes. It was yours,
but then you gave it to him.

395
00:15:33,649 --> 00:15:35,293
And now he's not using it,

396
00:15:35,317 --> 00:15:37,146
and I'm still down one kidney.

397
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:40,490
I loaned him my bike. I'm
probably gonna get that back.

398
00:15:40,573 --> 00:15:43,090
I should wait a
month or so. Sir, um,

399
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:46,594
transplanting the kidney put a
pretty big strain on the organ.

400
00:15:46,663 --> 00:15:49,129
To do it again would be
risky for you and your kidney.

401
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:50,859
See? His kidney.

402
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:52,561
You said "my kidney." You
think I should get it back.

403
00:15:52,585 --> 00:15:55,202
Um, I actually... I have
to be elsewhere right now.

404
00:15:55,271 --> 00:15:57,631
Oh. Oh, no. Of course.
Yeah, no. I'll wait here.

405
00:15:59,192 --> 00:16:00,736
Ouch.

406
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,321
We don't have to
cut Jared's intestine.

407
00:16:02,345 --> 00:16:03,944
What? Jared Cole.

408
00:16:04,013 --> 00:16:06,592
Instead of the intestine, we use
the appendix to make the stoma.

409
00:16:06,616 --> 00:16:08,126
It's easier on him,
and it's repurposing

410
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:09,595
something he
doesn't need anyway.

411
00:16:09,619 --> 00:16:11,602
That's the same procedure,

412
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,616
resulting in a
cutaneous end-stoma?

413
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,706
Even easier. And the
appendix is narrower,

414
00:16:15,774 --> 00:16:18,225
so a smaller hole in his
stomach, more normal life.

415
00:16:18,294 --> 00:16:21,779
Reduces complications,
recovery time and...

416
00:16:21,848 --> 00:16:23,163
Oh, crap.

417
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:25,099
Uh, sorry. I didn't
know you were, um...

418
00:16:25,168 --> 00:16:26,278
Uh, I can wait
till you're finished.

419
00:16:26,302 --> 00:16:27,380
No, Alex, it's fine.

420
00:16:27,404 --> 00:16:29,604
'Cause I never see
you like that. You okay?

421
00:16:29,672 --> 00:16:31,439
Yeah. It's a blister.

422
00:16:31,507 --> 00:16:33,069
I think using the appendix is
a great idea. Let's look into it.

423
00:16:33,093 --> 00:16:34,570
Well, I can get him prepped.

424
00:16:34,594 --> 00:16:36,305
Whoa, oh. This does not
mean that you're scrubbing in.

425
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:38,996
I'm sorry.

426
00:16:39,065 --> 00:16:41,477
He just came off his
hinges when he saw you.

427
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:43,028
Yeah, there are two
different looks that you get.

428
00:16:43,052 --> 00:16:44,764
Without the leg on,
they feel sorry for you.

429
00:16:44,788 --> 00:16:48,438
And with the leg on, they think
that you're amazing and brave.

430
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:50,091
Yeah. Or a robot.

431
00:16:52,579 --> 00:16:56,814
Hey. Any word from the police
about my mystery baby in a box?

432
00:16:56,882 --> 00:16:59,032
No. Social
Services is on it now.

433
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:00,317
What's his status?

434
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:02,003
Uh, he needs a
mitral valve repair,

435
00:17:02,071 --> 00:17:03,236
which I'm gonna do tomorrow.

436
00:17:03,305 --> 00:17:05,155
He's already been
through enough for one day.

437
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:06,390
Yeah.

438
00:17:09,579 --> 00:17:12,213
So, what's this I hear
about you being an idiot?

439
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:15,149
You broke up with
her? She was it, Owen.

440
00:17:15,217 --> 00:17:18,385
The picket fence, a dozen
kids, fresh baked goods.

441
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:19,882
I don't want to talk
about that, okay?

442
00:17:19,906 --> 00:17:23,101
Because you're dumb? No,
because it's between her and me.

443
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,736
And I hurt her, and I feel bad,

444
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,522
so I don't want
to talk about it.

445
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:28,279
Why throw that away?

446
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:31,331
Is it because of what
happened at the trailer?

447
00:17:31,418 --> 00:17:32,661
That was... Give me some credit.

448
00:17:32,685 --> 00:17:33,925
I know what that was.

449
00:17:35,755 --> 00:17:38,288
Then why?

450
00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:42,659
Okay, all right. Why are
you so upset about it?

451
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,041
Hmm? Uh, uh, because...

452
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,865
Because, why?

453
00:17:47,934 --> 00:17:51,374
Because of what
happened in the trailer?

454
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:54,449
I don't care for the
direction this is taking.

455
00:17:54,473 --> 00:17:56,873
I'll tell you if you tell me.

456
00:17:59,729 --> 00:18:01,628
No.

457
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:12,873
Dr. Robbins.

458
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:15,292
Hey, Herb.

459
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:17,495
Can I ask you a question?

460
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:20,781
Do you have kids?

461
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,327
Yes, I do. I have a little girl.

462
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:24,001
You have a little girl,

463
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:26,565
and you can still tell me that I
should cut my daughter's legs off?

464
00:18:26,589 --> 00:18:28,121
No.

465
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,135
Ultimately, that's her decision.

466
00:18:30,159 --> 00:18:32,020
But she can't make
it without your help.

467
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:34,628
You think her life's gonna
be better with no legs?

468
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:36,241
You think kids aren't
gonna stare at her,

469
00:18:36,265 --> 00:18:38,143
that they're not gonna make
fun of her if she's crippled?

470
00:18:38,167 --> 00:18:39,794
Disabled... Crippled, disabled.

471
00:18:39,818 --> 00:18:42,258
What difference does it make?
I don't care what you call it.

472
00:18:43,573 --> 00:18:45,456
How can you say that?

473
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,725
I never thought that
I'd carry my daughter

474
00:18:52,749 --> 00:18:54,815
or be a doctor again.

475
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:57,847
And now there's very few
things I can't do because of this.

476
00:18:57,871 --> 00:18:59,036
When did that happen?

477
00:18:59,104 --> 00:19:00,249
I've had it since before we met.

478
00:19:00,273 --> 00:19:02,340
I didn't notice. Why would you?

479
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,609
Herb,

480
00:19:05,678 --> 00:19:08,612
Alyssa's arthrogryposis
is so severe,

481
00:19:08,681 --> 00:19:11,493
and her muscles put too
much strain on her joints.

482
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:13,300
And it won't get worse,

483
00:19:13,369 --> 00:19:16,002
but the pain will never stop.

484
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,301
It's just me and
her now, and I don't

485
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:22,293
want to make the wrong
decision. I know. I know.

486
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:26,330
She's your little girl.

487
00:19:28,034 --> 00:19:30,245
46-year-old male, complains
of tightness in chest,

488
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:31,652
possibly heart-related,

489
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,532
probably enchilada-related.

490
00:19:33,556 --> 00:19:36,490
Pulse in the 70s, BP 170/110.

491
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:37,758
Trauma two.

492
00:19:37,827 --> 00:19:39,204
You do any more
bowling for doctors today?

493
00:19:39,228 --> 00:19:41,240
What? You heard?
Oh, it's all over the radio.

494
00:19:41,264 --> 00:19:42,496
Oh, my God.

495
00:19:42,565 --> 00:19:43,675
Oh, I'm just
saying, the next time

496
00:19:43,699 --> 00:19:45,611
you do it, try and
take out Kepner.

497
00:19:45,635 --> 00:19:47,155
Oh! Oh, God!

498
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:54,492
That'll work, too.

499
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:01,198
Guys, I'm fine, okay?

500
00:20:01,267 --> 00:20:03,017
I'm so sorry.

501
00:20:03,085 --> 00:20:05,753
No, no. You warned me
to stay out of your way.

502
00:20:05,822 --> 00:20:07,082
Was Robbins your warm-up?

503
00:20:07,106 --> 00:20:08,266
I didn't do this on purpose.

504
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,085
Edwards, I'm about
to take his pants off.

505
00:20:10,109 --> 00:20:13,269
Go be someplace where you
won't be a danger to others.

506
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,757
What happened? Oh, God.

507
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:17,047
Um...

508
00:20:17,116 --> 00:20:19,316
I'm fine, okay? I
got hit by a gurney.

509
00:20:21,837 --> 00:20:23,186
There she is!

510
00:20:23,255 --> 00:20:24,522
All right, Dr. Edwards!

511
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:27,024
Welcome back!

512
00:20:27,092 --> 00:20:29,693
Yeah! Two for two!

513
00:20:29,762 --> 00:20:31,240
Hey, Chief. Can I talk
to you for a second?

514
00:20:31,264 --> 00:20:32,357
Yeah. What is it, Grey?

515
00:20:32,381 --> 00:20:34,676
So, it's about Alex
Karev. Uh, sorry.

516
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,644
Um, Robbins? Have
you been up to HR today?

517
00:20:36,668 --> 00:20:38,664
Oh, no. I haven't had a chance.

518
00:20:38,688 --> 00:20:40,799
We've been developing a biliary
diversion using the appendix.

519
00:20:40,823 --> 00:20:42,701
Right. I was gonna have
all the interns observe.

520
00:20:42,725 --> 00:20:44,436
That is a pretty
inventive approach.

521
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:47,405
But, Robbins, HR needs
that statement today.

522
00:20:47,429 --> 00:20:48,796
Yeah, okay. Um...

523
00:20:48,865 --> 00:20:50,075
Bailey, why don't you
go on up without me?

524
00:20:50,099 --> 00:20:51,543
And by the time
that you have Jared

525
00:20:51,567 --> 00:20:52,945
on the table, I'll be
done with this thing.

526
00:20:52,969 --> 00:20:54,263
And you should get
someone to assist you, too.

527
00:20:54,287 --> 00:20:55,547
Oh, uh, I'll take
Grey. Right, no!

528
00:20:55,571 --> 00:20:56,682
Well, that's what I
wanted to talk to you

529
00:20:56,706 --> 00:20:57,999
about, because
it's Karev's case.

530
00:20:58,023 --> 00:21:00,035
It was his idea, so
he should be on it.

531
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:01,892
Karev's suspended. You're on it.

532
00:21:02,562 --> 00:21:03,562
Terrific.

533
00:21:05,014 --> 00:21:08,060
Hey. I have to tell Karev
that I stole his surgery.

534
00:21:08,084 --> 00:21:09,361
Oh, I have to tell Torres that

535
00:21:09,385 --> 00:21:11,780
the President won't let her
use my sensors anymore.

536
00:21:11,804 --> 00:21:13,932
Just tell her you made a
promise to her, but instead,

537
00:21:13,956 --> 00:21:17,352
you're gonna spend your time
and energy on something else.

538
00:21:17,376 --> 00:21:18,709
It worked when you told me.

539
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:20,138
I thought we were
gonna help each other.

540
00:21:20,162 --> 00:21:22,443
You left yourself
wide open there.

541
00:21:22,498 --> 00:21:23,881
Callie's a grown-up.

542
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,977
She knows how research
works. Just tell her.

543
00:21:26,001 --> 00:21:28,151
And Karev will be
understanding about it.

544
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,265
Oh, no. I'm not telling him.

545
00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:30,648
Did you get to talk to her?

546
00:21:30,672 --> 00:21:32,306
No. I was on the floor.

547
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:34,453
She didn't do it on
purpose, did she?

548
00:21:34,477 --> 00:21:36,577
No. No. I don't think so.

549
00:21:36,645 --> 00:21:38,245
Maybe.

550
00:21:38,331 --> 00:21:39,908
Well, what about you?
Did you talk to Matthew?

551
00:21:39,932 --> 00:21:42,649
I left another message.
Nicole said he quit,

552
00:21:42,719 --> 00:21:45,336
and then she called me a
name. So that's all I know.

553
00:21:45,404 --> 00:21:49,005
Can you just talk to her,
apologize for both of us?

554
00:21:49,074 --> 00:21:50,657
I'm trying.

555
00:21:50,727 --> 00:21:52,559
Nurses' station.

556
00:21:53,162 --> 00:21:54,711
Oh!

557
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,108
God, you scared me!
Any word on my kidney?

558
00:21:56,132 --> 00:21:57,881
You were gonna
give it some thought.

559
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:01,969
Uh, no. No, I wasn't.

560
00:22:02,054 --> 00:22:03,420
Oh, Dr. Hunt!

561
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:06,206
Um, do we return
donor organs to donors

562
00:22:06,275 --> 00:22:08,019
when the recipient passes on?

563
00:22:08,043 --> 00:22:10,460
Absolutely not. UNOS
is very strict about this.

564
00:22:12,014 --> 00:22:13,864
Um, why do you want it?

565
00:22:13,933 --> 00:22:15,373
Well, it's the
principle, isn't it?

566
00:22:15,418 --> 00:22:17,517
You know, these are not
the terms of the agreement.

567
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:19,720
I donated my
organ for a purpose,

568
00:22:19,788 --> 00:22:22,423
to filter my buddy's
pee or whatever it does.

569
00:22:22,492 --> 00:22:24,291
And now it's just
being discarded.

570
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,594
So I think I have a right
to get my kidney back.

571
00:22:26,662 --> 00:22:27,982
I'm not quite following. Is, um,

572
00:22:28,047 --> 00:22:30,281
your other kidney failing?

573
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:32,599
It could. You never know
what's gonna happen, right?

574
00:22:32,668 --> 00:22:34,084
You're just fine, sir.

575
00:22:34,152 --> 00:22:35,452
Am I?

576
00:22:37,506 --> 00:22:39,835
Oh, wow! Uh, that's
my pager vibrating.

577
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:41,770
Uh-huh. Oh! Oh! Is
yours vibrating, too?

578
00:22:41,794 --> 00:22:43,238
Oh, yeah, it is. It's
urgent. Um... Okay.

579
00:22:43,262 --> 00:22:44,606
We're very sorry
about your friend.

580
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:46,630
I'm sorry.

581
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:48,710
Is he stalking you?

582
00:22:48,734 --> 00:22:51,001
Uh...

583
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:55,817
Hey.

584
00:22:55,841 --> 00:22:57,352
Herb Cramer just told me that

585
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:58,953
you were pushing him toward
an amputation for Alyssa.

586
00:22:58,977 --> 00:23:00,989
No. I wasn't pushing
anything, Callie,

587
00:23:01,013 --> 00:23:02,808
but, I mean, it's
the right thing to do.

588
00:23:02,832 --> 00:23:04,676
And you've done palliative
amputations before.

589
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:07,300
Yeah, on a soldier! A grown man.

590
00:23:07,369 --> 00:23:08,546
Not a child whose
legs I have been

591
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:09,698
trying to correct
for three years!

592
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:11,605
And failing. I'm
sorry. It's true.

593
00:23:11,674 --> 00:23:13,068
And honestly, I
mean, before last year,

594
00:23:13,092 --> 00:23:14,403
I think that you
would have seen it.

595
00:23:14,427 --> 00:23:15,871
Okay. So you think
this is about you?

596
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:17,588
It's about Alyssa. It's
not about me. Yeah.

597
00:23:17,612 --> 00:23:18,857
But it's not about you, either.

598
00:23:18,881 --> 00:23:20,042
Why would you say
that it's not about me?

599
00:23:20,066 --> 00:23:21,309
I didn't say that
it... Because I am...

600
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:23,045
I think that you're afraid
to do this amputation,

601
00:23:23,069 --> 00:23:25,402
and I'm afraid that
that might be my fault.

602
00:23:26,439 --> 00:23:29,522
Dr. Robbins? Hi.
I'm Anne, from HR.

603
00:23:29,591 --> 00:23:31,075
We're ready for you upstairs.

604
00:23:31,143 --> 00:23:33,677
Okay, thanks.

605
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:35,295
I... Yeah.

606
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:40,228
There's just a few
questions we need to go over.

607
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:43,019
It shouldn't take long.
I'm sure you're busy.

608
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:51,679
<i>Clear!</i>

609
00:23:51,747 --> 00:23:53,308
Shane, no! Don't shock him!

610
00:23:53,332 --> 00:23:54,976
His heart can't
take defibrillation!

611
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,149
I thought so, too.

612
00:23:56,218 --> 00:23:58,296
So I tried to stabilize
him with cardioversion.

613
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,499
One shock, timed in the
refractory period of his heartbeat,

614
00:24:00,523 --> 00:24:01,972
to get a good sinus rhythm.

615
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,841
And I think it worked.

616
00:24:08,631 --> 00:24:09,847
Good call, Ross.

617
00:24:09,916 --> 00:24:12,266
He could have a
mitral valve rupture.

618
00:24:12,335 --> 00:24:15,236
Uh, clear an OR, page Robbins
and set up for a redo sternotomy.

619
00:24:15,304 --> 00:24:16,765
Okay. CALLIE: <i>They what?</i>

620
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:18,967
They want my sensors
proprietary to them,

621
00:24:18,991 --> 00:24:22,693
which means they can no
longer be used for our research.

622
00:24:22,762 --> 00:24:24,005
Well, we can't do our
research without them.

623
00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:25,624
I know. Well, what
are you gonna do?

624
00:24:25,648 --> 00:24:28,008
This isn't gonna keep you
from doing their project, is it?

625
00:24:32,705 --> 00:24:34,733
Ah. Callie, I never
expected them to do this.

626
00:24:34,757 --> 00:24:36,340
Okay.

627
00:24:36,409 --> 00:24:37,786
I'm going to try to fight them
on this, but in the meantime...

628
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:39,643
You understand?

629
00:24:39,712 --> 00:24:41,228
Uh, I think so.

630
00:24:41,297 --> 00:24:43,730
You partnered up with me,

631
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:45,143
but now you're taking our ball

632
00:24:45,167 --> 00:24:46,662
and you're gonna go
play with your new friends.

633
00:24:46,686 --> 00:24:48,619
I understand that
the last six months

634
00:24:48,687 --> 00:24:50,587
was a complete waste of my time.

635
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:55,726
She understands.

636
00:24:55,794 --> 00:24:59,329
And at that point, Dr. Torres
handed her the drill, correct?

637
00:24:59,398 --> 00:25:03,516
And that's when Dr. Murphy drilled
through Dr. Torres' patient's leg

638
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:05,363
and into the table?
That's correct, yes.

639
00:25:05,387 --> 00:25:06,619
At the time of that incident,

640
00:25:06,688 --> 00:25:08,016
you said you had terminated

641
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,056
any romantic relationship
with Dr. Murphy?

642
00:25:10,125 --> 00:25:11,241
I had, yes.

643
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:13,244
There was no
contact of a romantic

644
00:25:13,312 --> 00:25:15,261
or sexual nature
after the incident?

645
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:16,663
No. There was not.

646
00:25:16,731 --> 00:25:18,215
Okay.

647
00:25:18,283 --> 00:25:19,928
Oh, I have an emergency.
I'm sorry. I have to...

648
00:25:19,952 --> 00:25:22,402
No problem. That's
really all I need.

649
00:25:22,471 --> 00:25:25,150
Well, you... That's it? You
don't need me to come back?

650
00:25:25,174 --> 00:25:27,791
Mmm, no. Or do you have more...

651
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:30,472
No. No. It's just, I mean, if I'm
being accused of something,

652
00:25:30,496 --> 00:25:32,207
I think that I should
have a little more time to,

653
00:25:32,231 --> 00:25:34,209
you know, to speak
my... Oh, no. Don't worry.

654
00:25:34,233 --> 00:25:36,916
Dr. Murphy didn't lodge
the complaint against you.

655
00:25:37,937 --> 00:25:39,436
Thank you.

656
00:25:48,347 --> 00:25:49,813
Hey. What happened?

657
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:51,521
Oscar had flash pulmonary edema.

658
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,161
His mitral valve blew.
I'm gonna go fix it.

659
00:25:53,185 --> 00:25:54,985
I was stuck in HR.

660
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:56,770
Is Murphy coming after you?

661
00:25:56,839 --> 00:25:58,800
Worse, actually. Her
complaint is against Callie.

662
00:25:58,824 --> 00:26:00,651
Callie? Why? I don't know.

663
00:26:00,675 --> 00:26:03,995
No, I mean, I know, but
I didn't want to believe it.

664
00:26:04,113 --> 00:26:06,162
Right. "Oscar."

665
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:07,509
'Cause you found
him in a trash can.

666
00:26:07,533 --> 00:26:09,933
Hey, do you need to be
in your Byler's surgery?

667
00:26:10,002 --> 00:26:11,713
'Cause I'm good here. You sure?

668
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:14,104
Yeah. I've got Ross.

669
00:26:14,172 --> 00:26:15,684
Oh.

670
00:26:15,708 --> 00:26:17,920
Okay, that's Callie now.
Um, come find me after?

671
00:26:17,944 --> 00:26:19,337
Yeah. Okay.

672
00:26:19,361 --> 00:26:20,738
Tell Dr. Bailey to go
ahead and start without me.

673
00:26:20,762 --> 00:26:22,106
I'll be there as soon as I can.

674
00:26:23,465 --> 00:26:25,199
They asked for you.

675
00:26:30,372 --> 00:26:32,567
I just need to hear it again.

676
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:35,208
Tell me that you think
this is the right idea.

677
00:26:36,745 --> 00:26:37,761
I do.

678
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:39,270
Dr. Torres has
done everything that

679
00:26:39,331 --> 00:26:41,131
anyone could do
to stop your pain,

680
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,267
but... It's not working.

681
00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:44,668
And by every indication,

682
00:26:44,737 --> 00:26:46,798
more surgery will just mean
more time in a hospital bed,

683
00:26:46,822 --> 00:26:49,974
more scarring and
the same results.

684
00:26:50,042 --> 00:26:52,242
Pain for the rest of her life.

685
00:26:54,113 --> 00:26:56,329
She'll never run?

686
00:26:56,398 --> 00:26:59,083
I'll never walk her
down the aisle?

687
00:27:00,386 --> 00:27:01,985
Not unless we amputate.

688
00:27:13,332 --> 00:27:16,516
Instead of the surgery that
you have scheduled for today,

689
00:27:16,585 --> 00:27:19,068
please schedule a
double amputation.

690
00:27:21,173 --> 00:27:23,140
I want her pain to stop today.

691
00:27:24,843 --> 00:27:26,075
Okay.

692
00:27:30,866 --> 00:27:32,015
Thank you, Daddy.

693
00:27:37,572 --> 00:27:38,950
Callie. No, it's fine.

694
00:27:38,974 --> 00:27:40,674
It's just one more thing today.

695
00:27:40,743 --> 00:27:42,804
Thank you, Doctor.
HR wants to see you.

696
00:27:42,828 --> 00:27:45,145
Leah Murphy's
complaint is against you.

697
00:27:45,214 --> 00:27:47,359
They wanted Hunt to tell
you, but I asked if I could.

698
00:27:47,383 --> 00:27:50,534
I thought that I, you know...

699
00:27:53,105 --> 00:27:55,839
Okay, well, um...

700
00:27:55,908 --> 00:27:58,258
I, uh, have to push
this amputation...

701
00:27:58,327 --> 00:28:01,323
No, I'll take that off your
plate. I mean, I'll do it.

702
00:28:01,347 --> 00:28:03,707
And you come find
me when you're done?

703
00:28:04,149 --> 00:28:05,481
I'm sorry.

704
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:07,062
You know, I just got
through a malpractice suit.

705
00:28:07,086 --> 00:28:08,497
Now I have to deal with
your jealous ex-girlfriend

706
00:28:08,521 --> 00:28:09,803
trying to ruin my reputation?

707
00:28:09,871 --> 00:28:12,067
I swear to God, I can't
take any more of this!

708
00:28:12,091 --> 00:28:14,408
<i>The heart has so
many abnormalities.</i>

709
00:28:14,477 --> 00:28:17,027
It's incredibly fragile. Cut.

710
00:28:17,096 --> 00:28:19,263
Uh, 4-0 prolene.

711
00:28:19,331 --> 00:28:21,491
You have to really be delicate.

712
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:27,081
I want to ask you
about something,

713
00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:29,201
but there are all
these new rules,

714
00:28:29,225 --> 00:28:32,792
and, uh, the act of me
asking might be breaking them.

715
00:28:32,861 --> 00:28:34,244
You can ask.

716
00:28:34,313 --> 00:28:35,828
There was a complaint.

717
00:28:35,897 --> 00:28:37,164
That's a question?

718
00:28:37,232 --> 00:28:38,748
I thought it might be you.

719
00:28:38,817 --> 00:28:40,117
It wasn't.

720
00:28:40,186 --> 00:28:42,197
I know, but it made me wonder

721
00:28:42,221 --> 00:28:44,521
if you ever felt compromised.

722
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:45,867
Because I didn't want you to.

723
00:28:45,891 --> 00:28:47,040
I didn't.

724
00:28:47,727 --> 00:28:49,459
Good.

725
00:28:49,528 --> 00:28:51,122
Oh, now that
sounds like coercion.

726
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:52,690
Like I'm telling you how
you were supposed to feel.

727
00:28:52,714 --> 00:28:53,825
I didn't take it that way.

728
00:28:53,849 --> 00:28:54,993
Really?

729
00:28:55,017 --> 00:28:56,560
You're not just saying
that to curry favor?

730
00:28:56,584 --> 00:28:58,318
No. I'm not "currying" anything.

731
00:28:58,386 --> 00:29:00,165
Because you never
have to do that.

732
00:29:00,189 --> 00:29:02,133
You don't have to
get Shepherd coffee

733
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:04,235
or fix Callie's baby schedule

734
00:29:04,259 --> 00:29:06,059
or relax me.

735
00:29:06,128 --> 00:29:08,340
You're too good
of a doctor for that.

736
00:29:08,364 --> 00:29:10,675
And when you look
back in 10 years,

737
00:29:10,699 --> 00:29:13,183
you'll be relieved you didn't.

738
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:15,230
I don't know if I'll even
be a doctor in 10 years.

739
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:18,238
Oh, shut up. You
will. You better.

740
00:29:18,307 --> 00:29:19,556
Now, that's coercion.

741
00:29:23,295 --> 00:29:25,129
That should be you down there.

742
00:29:25,197 --> 00:29:27,709
Who cares? I'm doing
an organ recovery.

743
00:29:27,733 --> 00:29:28,932
Screw peds.

744
00:29:29,001 --> 00:29:30,278
I'll basically be on general,

745
00:29:30,302 --> 00:29:32,047
cardiothoracic, ortho, plastics

746
00:29:32,071 --> 00:29:33,731
and pulmonary in one operation.

747
00:29:33,755 --> 00:29:37,357
Wow. I've got to go up to HR
to fill out an accident report.

748
00:29:37,426 --> 00:29:38,787
Oh, for hitting
Robbins with a gurney?

749
00:29:38,811 --> 00:29:40,811
For hitting Jackson
with a gurney.

750
00:29:41,346 --> 00:29:42,612
Yeah.

751
00:29:43,348 --> 00:29:44,431
Ahem!

752
00:29:51,423 --> 00:29:53,556
<i>Robbins should
be here to see this.</i>

753
00:29:53,626 --> 00:29:54,908
<i>Looks good.</i>

754
00:29:54,977 --> 00:29:56,709
<i>Appendix is holding.</i>

755
00:29:56,778 --> 00:30:00,730
Uh, Grey, will you intubate the
stoma, make sure it's patent?

756
00:30:05,237 --> 00:30:07,157
Oh, crap. What? What happened?

757
00:30:12,744 --> 00:30:13,944
What? What's going on?

758
00:30:14,012 --> 00:30:16,190
He's gone into v-fib. I
pushed epi and atropine.

759
00:30:16,214 --> 00:30:17,725
Did you shock him?
You gotta shock him!

760
00:30:17,749 --> 00:30:19,461
Dr. Wilson, he's already gone!

761
00:30:19,485 --> 00:30:20,862
No! There are at
least nine people

762
00:30:20,886 --> 00:30:22,196
counting on him not to be gone!

763
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:23,297
Move! Clear!

764
00:30:26,508 --> 00:30:27,807
What are you doing here?

765
00:30:27,876 --> 00:30:30,844
You asked for a resident.
I'm the only one available.

766
00:30:32,014 --> 00:30:33,254
I'll do it myself.

767
00:30:35,433 --> 00:30:37,000
Are you actually gonna do that?

768
00:30:37,069 --> 00:30:38,346
You're gonna refuse
to work with me...

769
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:39,936
Leah, I cared for you.

770
00:30:40,005 --> 00:30:41,415
I liked you, and
that's all that it was.

771
00:30:41,439 --> 00:30:43,217
And I am sorry that I hurt you.

772
00:30:43,241 --> 00:30:45,120
But if you're gonna come after
my wife now because of the...

773
00:30:45,144 --> 00:30:48,145
I know what our relationship
was. I'm not a child.

774
00:30:48,213 --> 00:30:49,724
I never thought of
it in terms of work.

775
00:30:49,748 --> 00:30:51,715
It was you who brought
it into the hospital.

776
00:30:51,784 --> 00:30:53,416
You told Dr. Torres about us,

777
00:30:53,485 --> 00:30:55,052
and Dr. Torres
chose not to teach me

778
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,921
in a moment that put
a patient in danger.

779
00:30:57,990 --> 00:31:00,456
She made me put a
patient in danger. So did you.

780
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:01,552
I never thought that...

781
00:31:01,576 --> 00:31:03,477
You were thinking
about yourself.

782
00:31:03,562 --> 00:31:07,230
It wasn't safe, it wasn't fair,
and I had to say something.

783
00:31:07,298 --> 00:31:10,750
Because it shouldn't happen
again, to me or anyone.

784
00:31:16,858 --> 00:31:20,794
You want to cut the fibula 1 to 2
centimeters proximal to the tibia.

785
00:31:23,249 --> 00:31:26,094
Then you're gonna
reshape the end with a bevel

786
00:31:26,118 --> 00:31:28,358
so that the prosthesis
will fit better.

787
00:31:32,123 --> 00:31:34,307
You watching? Good.

788
00:31:34,376 --> 00:31:36,816
'Cause you're gonna
do the other leg yourself.

789
00:31:42,267 --> 00:31:45,202
Hey. Hi, Kim.

790
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:46,436
How are you feeling?

791
00:31:46,504 --> 00:31:47,871
I feel pretty good.

792
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:49,750
Yeah. And you don't
look like a basketball.

793
00:31:49,774 --> 00:31:51,424
You did a good job.

794
00:31:51,493 --> 00:31:53,293
Yeah, well, I had to watch them,

795
00:31:53,362 --> 00:31:55,094
make sure they
didn't screw it up.

796
00:31:56,598 --> 00:31:57,648
Get some rest?

797
00:31:58,616 --> 00:31:59,783
All right.

798
00:32:03,355 --> 00:32:04,966
That was having my back?

799
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:06,834
I knew you were a hypocrite,
but that was really cold.

800
00:32:06,858 --> 00:32:08,769
Stop it. You're suspended.
Somebody had to be in there.

801
00:32:08,793 --> 00:32:09,859
Read this.

802
00:32:09,911 --> 00:32:11,773
What is it? It's me
having your back.

803
00:32:11,797 --> 00:32:13,630
I got it from HR.
It's a love contract.

804
00:32:14,083 --> 00:32:15,448
A what?

805
00:32:15,517 --> 00:32:16,844
It's a declaration
of a relationship.

806
00:32:16,868 --> 00:32:18,885
If you sign this
and Wilson signs it,

807
00:32:18,971 --> 00:32:21,271
it clears everybody
from any claims

808
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:23,256
of favoritism or
sexual harassment.

809
00:32:23,325 --> 00:32:25,102
That's the stupidest
thing I ever heard of.

810
00:32:25,126 --> 00:32:26,759
Well, it sounds stupid,

811
00:32:26,828 --> 00:32:29,273
but HR said if you sign this that
it makes the whole thing go away.

812
00:32:29,297 --> 00:32:30,541
So, sign it. No!

813
00:32:30,565 --> 00:32:31,909
Well, then I'm done
trying to help you.

814
00:32:31,933 --> 00:32:33,244
I can't go to her with this.

815
00:32:33,268 --> 00:32:34,446
Look, I asked her to marry me

816
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:35,630
when I was freaking
out about my dad.

817
00:32:35,654 --> 00:32:37,014
I scared the crap out of her.

818
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:38,182
If you guys keep
screwing with us...

819
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:39,406
How are we screwing with you?

820
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:41,002
Jo wants to be a surgeon, Mer.

821
00:32:41,026 --> 00:32:42,720
She came from
nothing to be here.

822
00:32:42,744 --> 00:32:45,306
Now, 'cause of me, there are
suspensions and punishments.

823
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:47,408
If you keep making it
harder, she's gonna leave me.

824
00:32:47,432 --> 00:32:48,709
And if you make it too hard,

825
00:32:48,733 --> 00:32:50,853
she's gonna be like
Izzie and she'll walk.

826
00:32:51,586 --> 00:32:54,020
Will you just sign
the stupid paper?

827
00:32:57,158 --> 00:32:59,693
Watch his sats
through the night.

828
00:32:59,761 --> 00:33:01,661
Below 85, page me.

829
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:02,874
Uh, is that Oscar's file?

830
00:33:02,898 --> 00:33:03,947
The baby? Yes.

831
00:33:04,016 --> 00:33:06,049
And that stays with him, right?

832
00:33:06,118 --> 00:33:09,636
And his name, Dr. Shane Ross.

833
00:33:09,705 --> 00:33:11,800
The adoptive parents
will have questions.

834
00:33:11,824 --> 00:33:14,657
In 10 years, Oscar
will have questions.

835
00:33:14,726 --> 00:33:15,966
And you will answer them.

836
00:33:21,182 --> 00:33:22,660
You know, I could sue you guys.

837
00:33:22,684 --> 00:33:24,128
I could sue this
entire hospital.

838
00:33:24,152 --> 00:33:26,920
Sir, you signed away your
legal rights to the kidney

839
00:33:26,988 --> 00:33:28,216
when you agreed to be a donor!

840
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,539
No, he broke our deal.

841
00:33:29,608 --> 00:33:32,153
The terms were I give
him my kidney to use,

842
00:33:32,177 --> 00:33:33,405
and he has broken our deal!

843
00:33:33,429 --> 00:33:35,056
It was a gift! He threw it away!

844
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:38,081
Thom! Step back right
now, or I will call security.

845
00:33:38,149 --> 00:33:40,178
Dr. Kepner. Wilson...

846
00:33:40,202 --> 00:33:41,896
Donald Mercer
suffered cardiac death.

847
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:44,114
Organ recovery's called
off. It's all going in the trash.

848
00:33:44,138 --> 00:33:47,874
Dr. Wilson, Thom here
is Mr. Mercer's friend.

849
00:33:49,244 --> 00:33:50,877
Oh, I'm sorry.

850
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:53,265
No. No, he what? Donald what?

851
00:33:54,049 --> 00:33:55,465
He died, Thom.

852
00:33:55,534 --> 00:33:58,952
No, I don't understand. You
said he was just brain dead.

853
00:34:00,205 --> 00:34:01,538
He was.

854
00:34:01,606 --> 00:34:04,840
He was, and his heart
was sustaining his organs.

855
00:34:04,909 --> 00:34:06,976
But now his organs
are no longer viable

856
00:34:07,028 --> 00:34:08,762
for donation because he's gone.

857
00:34:09,814 --> 00:34:11,048
Donald is gone.

858
00:34:11,116 --> 00:34:12,327
This is not right.

859
00:34:12,351 --> 00:34:13,591
This is not fair.

860
00:34:13,635 --> 00:34:14,835
I know. I know it's not fair.

861
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:16,336
It's not fair at all.

862
00:34:16,404 --> 00:34:19,317
No, no. He's my best
friend, since 7th grade.

863
00:34:19,341 --> 00:34:24,444
I saved his life. I
gave him my kidney.

864
00:34:24,513 --> 00:34:25,623
I was...

865
00:34:25,647 --> 00:34:28,631
I was supposed
to have saved his...

866
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:30,733
I just... Okay.

867
00:34:30,802 --> 00:34:32,351
All right, come on. I know.

868
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:35,789
Let's just sit down.

869
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:40,393
Ohh.

870
00:34:41,563 --> 00:34:43,797
Hey. Oscar's doing well.

871
00:34:43,866 --> 00:34:46,049
He needs more
observation, but...

872
00:34:46,117 --> 00:34:47,150
Ooh!

873
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:48,718
Oh, yeah. Bad leg day.

874
00:34:49,338 --> 00:34:51,538
Yeah, me too.

875
00:34:54,176 --> 00:34:57,188
What would have happened if
they hadn't found him out there?

876
00:34:57,212 --> 00:34:59,078
He'd be dead.
Yeah, but he's not.

877
00:34:59,147 --> 00:35:02,343
He'll grow up. He'll be,
you know, who knows who.

878
00:35:02,367 --> 00:35:04,017
He'll have a whole life.

879
00:35:05,153 --> 00:35:06,419
Yay.

880
00:35:06,487 --> 00:35:07,721
Yeah.

881
00:35:10,626 --> 00:35:12,959
Do you still have
dreams about it?

882
00:35:13,896 --> 00:35:15,862
Oh, yeah.

883
00:35:15,931 --> 00:35:18,264
Usually when I'm anxious.

884
00:35:18,333 --> 00:35:21,868
The day, um, before Sofia
started her first day of preschool,

885
00:35:21,937 --> 00:35:23,481
I dreamt about it all night,

886
00:35:23,505 --> 00:35:27,541
about Mark and
Lexie and the pilot,

887
00:35:27,609 --> 00:35:29,108
Jerry.

888
00:35:29,177 --> 00:35:30,944
Jerry. Jerry.

889
00:35:33,415 --> 00:35:38,317
For me, I dream
about you screaming.

890
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:40,654
You wouldn't stop screaming.

891
00:35:40,722 --> 00:35:42,956
So thank you for that.

892
00:35:50,198 --> 00:35:52,131
Good job today.

893
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,349
Yeah. Lucky kid.

894
00:35:53,418 --> 00:35:54,684
Ohh.

895
00:35:55,954 --> 00:35:57,420
Lucky kid.

896
00:35:57,489 --> 00:35:59,855
Just the accident report and
the worker's comp paperwork.

897
00:35:59,924 --> 00:36:03,159
Shouldn't take long.
You can sit in here.

898
00:36:07,799 --> 00:36:12,384
Dr. Edwards is filling out
an accident report, as well.

899
00:36:12,453 --> 00:36:14,373
You two mind sharing? Brilliant.

900
00:36:14,423 --> 00:36:15,750
You know what? I can come back.

901
00:36:15,774 --> 00:36:17,201
No. It's fine. I'm almost done.

902
00:36:17,225 --> 00:36:18,357
Okay, then.

903
00:36:29,454 --> 00:36:30,553
How's your leg?

904
00:36:30,622 --> 00:36:31,662
My knee is...

905
00:36:33,007 --> 00:36:34,190
I'm fine.

906
00:36:36,995 --> 00:36:39,075
How about you? How are you?

907
00:36:40,449 --> 00:36:41,781
I didn't see you coming.

908
00:36:41,867 --> 00:36:43,900
That's not what I
meant. No, I know that.

909
00:36:43,969 --> 00:36:45,901
I'm sorry, Stephanie.

910
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:50,507
Will you let me say that to you,
please? Okay? I am so sorry.

911
00:36:50,576 --> 00:36:55,679
I had no idea I was
gonna do that. None.

912
00:36:55,747 --> 00:36:59,982
I thought I was... I told
myself that I didn't want her,

913
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:03,491
that April didn't want
me. And you and I...

914
00:37:05,106 --> 00:37:06,405
Steph, you are so...

915
00:37:06,475 --> 00:37:08,074
Please don't.

916
00:37:08,143 --> 00:37:10,688
Don't do that. I'm trying to
say I didn't see it coming.

917
00:37:10,712 --> 00:37:14,881
Okay? There's no way
I wanted to hurt you.

918
00:37:14,966 --> 00:37:17,567
And I don't know how
I can make that better.

919
00:37:17,636 --> 00:37:18,902
You can't.

920
00:37:20,338 --> 00:37:22,099
And, anyway, we both
got a day we'll never forget.

921
00:37:22,123 --> 00:37:23,373
Steph...

922
00:37:23,442 --> 00:37:25,036
You got a day to tell
your grandkids about,

923
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:28,261
and I got something I'd never
gotten before. I got pitied.

924
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:31,347
I was suddenly the girl
who wasn't good enough

925
00:37:31,416 --> 00:37:35,951
or smart enough or pretty
enough or not deserving.

926
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:38,788
I've never gotten that look
before because I'm not that girl.

927
00:37:38,856 --> 00:37:40,707
I know that.

928
00:37:40,775 --> 00:37:44,343
Look, you can hit me with as
many gurneys as you want to,

929
00:37:44,412 --> 00:37:46,090
because I'm gonna
feel terrible about this

930
00:37:46,114 --> 00:37:47,646
for the rest of my life.

931
00:37:47,715 --> 00:37:50,367
Okay. Well, you do that
if you want to. I'm not.

932
00:37:50,435 --> 00:37:53,503
I'm not going to feel sad

933
00:37:53,572 --> 00:37:57,574
or angry or pitiable
for one more minute,

934
00:37:57,643 --> 00:37:59,323
because I'm not
gonna care about you.

935
00:38:00,645 --> 00:38:03,379
So, if I don't say hello or
make small talk in the elevator

936
00:38:03,448 --> 00:38:06,715
or acknowledge your birthday
or even acknowledge you're alive,

937
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:09,852
it's because, to
me, you just exist.

938
00:38:10,888 --> 00:38:11,904
Because I don't care.

939
00:38:14,042 --> 00:38:17,743
<i>Why does it feel so
good to get rid of things...</i>

940
00:38:23,184 --> 00:38:25,184
<i>To unload...</i>

941
00:38:27,205 --> 00:38:28,205
<i>To let go?</i>

942
00:38:29,423 --> 00:38:31,091
How did it go?

943
00:38:34,513 --> 00:38:36,513
I'm going to bed.

944
00:38:36,581 --> 00:38:38,626
I think Murphy was right.

945
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:40,683
Oh, of course she
was right, Arizona!

946
00:38:40,752 --> 00:38:44,254
I mistreated her! And I was
petty and jealous and at my worst

947
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:46,839
because you slept with
her! Of course, she was right!

948
00:38:49,861 --> 00:38:51,761
I keep thinking we're okay.

949
00:38:52,564 --> 00:38:55,130
And we buy a house,

950
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:58,968
and then this happens, and
I'm not sure we'll ever be okay.

951
00:38:59,036 --> 00:39:02,739
And today I lost my
research, I failed a patient,

952
00:39:02,807 --> 00:39:04,807
and now I have a
disciplinary report

953
00:39:04,876 --> 00:39:05,920
that's gonna follow me forever.

954
00:39:05,944 --> 00:39:07,438
So I'm going to bed! I'm sorry.

955
00:39:07,462 --> 00:39:09,473
I feel like all I've been doing
is thinking about myself.

956
00:39:09,497 --> 00:39:10,729
God, I swear! I swear

957
00:39:10,798 --> 00:39:12,576
I cannot listen to you
apologize one more time.

958
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,850
You have made it very
hard to keep forgiving you!

959
00:39:14,919 --> 00:39:17,187
For over a year,
since the plane crash,

960
00:39:17,255 --> 00:39:20,006
all I have been
thinking about is myself.

961
00:39:20,075 --> 00:39:23,977
I had to figure
out how to be me.

962
00:39:24,045 --> 00:39:27,397
I used to be someone
who was always happy.

963
00:39:27,465 --> 00:39:29,232
I woke up happy.

964
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:32,668
I was someone who
used to skate at work.

965
00:39:32,737 --> 00:39:35,888
And then this happened,
and everything was hard

966
00:39:35,957 --> 00:39:40,426
and everything took
thought and planning.

967
00:39:40,495 --> 00:39:43,062
And my life felt like it
didn't fit me anymore.

968
00:39:43,131 --> 00:39:45,976
And I just... I wanted to
tear it all down and start over,

969
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,569
just throw it away and find
a life that fit who I am now.

970
00:39:51,439 --> 00:39:56,142
But I'm starting to feel
like I know who I am again.

971
00:39:58,413 --> 00:40:00,814
And I've had to give up things,

972
00:40:00,882 --> 00:40:03,949
but what I've learned is
that I don't need much.

973
00:40:05,436 --> 00:40:09,856
I don't need much to be happy.
I don't even need two legs.

974
00:40:09,925 --> 00:40:13,492
But I do know that I need you.

975
00:40:13,561 --> 00:40:15,695
I need Sofia,

976
00:40:16,397 --> 00:40:18,414
and I need you.

977
00:40:18,483 --> 00:40:22,568
And I'm afraid, now that
I've learned all of that,

978
00:40:23,688 --> 00:40:26,128
that I made you give up on me.

979
00:40:27,308 --> 00:40:29,219
<i>Maybe because when we see</i>

980
00:40:29,243 --> 00:40:31,861
<i>how little we actually
need to survive...</i>

981
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:53,866
You shouldn't have
to give up anything.

982
00:40:53,935 --> 00:40:57,403
<i>It makes us realize how
powerful we actually are,</i>

983
00:41:00,608 --> 00:41:03,109
<i>to strip down to
only what we need...</i>

984
00:41:05,697 --> 00:41:08,408
You want to know why
I'm upset? I'll tell you why.

985
00:41:08,432 --> 00:41:10,411
Okay, why? She's
what you wanted.

986
00:41:10,435 --> 00:41:12,935
You don't just throw
away a future like that.

987
00:41:13,004 --> 00:41:14,086
I want you to be happy.

988
00:41:14,172 --> 00:41:16,021
Oh, do you? Of course!

989
00:41:16,090 --> 00:41:19,469
Or do you just want to
see me squared away?

990
00:41:19,493 --> 00:41:20,793
What does that mean?

991
00:41:20,862 --> 00:41:22,790
It means, uh, you want
to see me, you know,

992
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:26,334
get what I want so you don't
have to feel guilty anymore.

993
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:27,733
About what?

994
00:41:27,802 --> 00:41:29,042
About not giving it to me.

995
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:30,586
Oh, whoa!

996
00:41:30,655 --> 00:41:32,295
Right? Mmm.

997
00:41:33,458 --> 00:41:36,570
It's either that, or you just
want to see me get married off

998
00:41:36,594 --> 00:41:38,806
so you're forced to
stop thinking about me.

999
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:40,341
Oh, that's it. That's the one.

1000
00:41:40,365 --> 00:41:41,942
Yeah. Mmm-hmm.

1001
00:41:41,966 --> 00:41:45,568
<i>To hang on only to
what we can't do without,</i>

1002
00:41:45,637 --> 00:41:47,303
<i>what we need,</i>

1003
00:41:48,573 --> 00:41:50,223
<i>not just to survive...</i>

1004
00:41:51,159 --> 00:41:53,092
Yes!

1005
00:41:55,563 --> 00:41:56,713
<i>But to thrive.</i>

1006
00:41:56,765 --> 00:41:57,975
Oh! Oh!

1007
00:41:57,999 --> 00:41:59,459
Hold on to me. Okay.

1008
00:42:06,991 --> 00:42:08,558
Here we go!
