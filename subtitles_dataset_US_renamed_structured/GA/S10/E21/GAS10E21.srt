1
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:03,913
<i>Over the past 20 years,</i>

2
00:00:03,937 --> 00:00:07,539
<i>one of the most valuable tools
a doctor has is the algorithm.</i>

3
00:00:07,607 --> 00:00:10,236
<i>Your patient's main
complaint goes into a box...</i>

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,838
Cristina was
supposed to fly out with

5
00:00:11,862 --> 00:00:13,606
us this morning,
and she didn't show.

6
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:16,509
<i>And then the formula helps
you decide what to do next.</i>

7
00:00:16,533 --> 00:00:18,283
Her phone's still off.

8
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:21,548
No, uh, Derek, all she said
was, "That's how it goes."

9
00:00:21,572 --> 00:00:23,366
Last night after the ceremony.

10
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:24,934
And then that
smug idiot's speech

11
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:26,736
was a 20-minute ode to himself.

12
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,710
Ma'am, we're shutting the doors.

13
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:30,857
She'll just be one second.

14
00:00:30,881 --> 00:00:32,876
His research wasn't
even research.

15
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,879
I read his paper on lymph
nodes. It sounded plagiarized.

16
00:00:35,903 --> 00:00:38,648
I'm very sorry, but you'll
need to put your phone away.

17
00:00:38,672 --> 00:00:39,855
I heard you.

18
00:00:39,923 --> 00:00:41,468
Uh, I'll call you when we land.

19
00:00:41,492 --> 00:00:42,858
<i>But what happens when</i>

20
00:00:42,926 --> 00:00:45,371
<i>the problem
doesn't fit into a box?</i>

21
00:00:45,395 --> 00:00:47,295
All right, Mama hung up on us.

22
00:00:47,364 --> 00:00:49,431
Zola, time to put on
your shoes, sweetie.

23
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,044
<i>Well...</i>

24
00:00:51,068 --> 00:00:53,346
<i>You're suddenly on
your own, unexpectedly,</i>

25
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:56,104
<i>with about a thousand
paths to choose from.</i>

26
00:00:56,173 --> 00:00:58,368
I should have
called. I know. Uh...

27
00:00:58,392 --> 00:01:00,426
But if I called,
you'd have said no.

28
00:01:00,494 --> 00:01:04,028
And then I wouldn't get to
see how grown up you are.

29
00:01:04,098 --> 00:01:06,064
Zola! Wow!

30
00:01:06,133 --> 00:01:09,468
Look at you! What
are you, 16 now?

31
00:01:09,537 --> 00:01:11,970
And I wanted to
meet my nephew. Oh.

32
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:14,250
Um... Hello to you, too.

33
00:01:14,274 --> 00:01:15,651
I haven't talked to
you in two months.

34
00:01:15,675 --> 00:01:17,504
Amy, what are you doing here?

35
00:01:17,528 --> 00:01:19,027
A thing happened.

36
00:01:20,915 --> 00:01:22,513
James proposed.

37
00:01:22,566 --> 00:01:24,533
Ah! Congratulations.

38
00:01:24,618 --> 00:01:26,129
And I freaked. I'm sure you did.

39
00:01:26,153 --> 00:01:28,386
Just sort of freaked. Not
flee-the-country freaked.

40
00:01:28,455 --> 00:01:31,406
Just suddenly...

41
00:01:31,474 --> 00:01:32,852
There's the possibility
that I may be

42
00:01:32,876 --> 00:01:34,209
facing a different kind of life.

43
00:01:34,294 --> 00:01:36,061
The kind that you
and Meredith have.

44
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:37,528
So I thought I would come visit

45
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:40,948
and see what it's like
and get unfreaked.

46
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:42,050
Hopefully.

47
00:01:42,118 --> 00:01:43,151
You're mad.

48
00:01:43,219 --> 00:01:45,015
No. I'm happy to show you.

49
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:48,267
Hey, Zola, Auntie Amy is gonna
play with you and Bailey today

50
00:01:48,291 --> 00:01:50,409
while I go to work. Oh. Oh.

51
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:52,288
Wow. Really not
mad. No, I'm excited.

52
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:54,390
Yeah. So, Bailey
gets bottle in an hour.

53
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:56,309
His schedule's
on the refrigerator.

54
00:01:56,333 --> 00:01:58,245
Zola likes to stick
stuff up her nose,

55
00:01:58,269 --> 00:01:59,629
so keep an eye on her. Oh.

56
00:01:59,653 --> 00:02:00,786
Okay.

57
00:02:01,554 --> 00:02:02,666
I'll see you later.

58
00:02:06,726 --> 00:02:08,454
<i>Okay, so, we
turkey-baste me in May.</i>

59
00:02:08,478 --> 00:02:10,440
And then the baby's
born in February?

60
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:11,496
Yep.

61
00:02:13,249 --> 00:02:15,461
Sorry. Just, uh, need to
borrow some toothpaste.

62
00:02:15,485 --> 00:02:17,168
As you were.

63
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:19,538
Okay, so, I take off the
spring, recover, nurse,

64
00:02:19,607 --> 00:02:21,339
and then you take
off the summer.

65
00:02:21,408 --> 00:02:23,487
Mmm-hmm. And then I
put Karev in charge of peds.

66
00:02:23,511 --> 00:02:24,788
I think that that works.

67
00:02:24,812 --> 00:02:25,839
Are you sure about that?

68
00:02:25,863 --> 00:02:27,073
'Cause if you're
gone in the summer,

69
00:02:27,097 --> 00:02:28,741
you're gone when
the new interns start.

70
00:02:28,765 --> 00:02:30,327
You really want Karev in
charge of all the new kids?

71
00:02:30,351 --> 00:02:32,161
Maybe push off the
insemination to July?

72
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:34,136
Kepner. Kepner.

73
00:02:34,204 --> 00:02:35,721
Get out of my vagina.

74
00:02:36,423 --> 00:02:38,851
Yes. Right.

75
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:40,375
Oh, wow.

76
00:02:40,444 --> 00:02:41,843
It's really only
been two nights?

77
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:43,662
'Cause it feels like 10.

78
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:47,326
No. I'm not gonna
have time to pre-round.

79
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:48,550
Screw pre-rounds.

80
00:02:48,619 --> 00:02:51,339
Your peds fellow
needs a consult.

81
00:02:55,426 --> 00:02:57,437
No! No, no, no. Wait,
wait. You have to work, too.

82
00:02:57,461 --> 00:02:58,727
You're avoiding something.

83
00:02:58,796 --> 00:03:00,261
Less talk, more stuff.

84
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:02,064
No, Alex. I'm serious.

85
00:03:02,732 --> 00:03:05,067
What's going on?

86
00:03:05,135 --> 00:03:07,814
I got an offer from Lebackes
to work at his practice.

87
00:03:07,838 --> 00:03:09,849
It's a good offer.
A really good offer.

88
00:03:09,873 --> 00:03:11,172
Oh! That's great!

89
00:03:12,509 --> 00:03:14,409
Why don't you
look like it's great?

90
00:03:14,478 --> 00:03:16,155
I'm supposed to give them an
answer by the end of the day.

91
00:03:16,179 --> 00:03:17,712
Oh.

92
00:03:17,781 --> 00:03:20,610
Robbins is gonna be so
pissed. What am I gonna tell her?

93
00:03:20,634 --> 00:03:24,436
Just be pleasant and
confident and firm,

94
00:03:24,505 --> 00:03:26,721
smile when you talk,

95
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:28,423
and just tell her
how excited you are

96
00:03:28,492 --> 00:03:30,341
about this great
new opportunity.

97
00:03:30,411 --> 00:03:32,644
If she starts making
her scary, angry face,

98
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:34,379
distract her with a compliment.

99
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:38,549
That works? The
compliments thing? Mmm-hmm.

100
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:40,990
God, you're sexy.

101
00:03:41,588 --> 00:03:43,255
Doesn't work on me.

102
00:03:48,495 --> 00:03:50,039
Frankie McNeil, post-op,

103
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,540
day two after LVAD implantation.

104
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:53,760
Currently listed status
1A for transplant.

105
00:03:53,784 --> 00:03:55,024
Despite the LVAD,

106
00:03:55,085 --> 00:03:57,597
we haven't been able to
reverse her end-organ damage.

107
00:03:57,621 --> 00:03:59,866
The good news is a heart
became available this morning.

108
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:02,569
We're just waiting for confirmation
from the hospital in Oakland.

109
00:04:02,593 --> 00:04:03,920
I'm sorry, but who
are you again?

110
00:04:03,944 --> 00:04:05,455
Oh, I'm sorry,
um, Dr. Russell is

111
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:07,295
our head of
cardiothoracic surgery.

112
00:04:07,363 --> 00:04:08,596
Since Dr. Yang's not back,

113
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:10,798
he'll be performing
Frankie's transplant today.

114
00:04:10,867 --> 00:04:12,718
But Dr. Yang's our surgeon.

115
00:04:12,786 --> 00:04:15,198
No offense, but how do
we know you're as good?

116
00:04:15,222 --> 00:04:17,150
I'm an attending.
She's a fellow.

117
00:04:17,174 --> 00:04:19,119
Trust me, I'm as good.

118
00:04:19,143 --> 00:04:20,820
Dr. Robbins and I will be
in the OR the entire time.

119
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:22,084
Frankie's in good hands.

120
00:04:22,446 --> 00:04:24,246
And Link?

121
00:04:24,314 --> 00:04:26,492
Breath sounds are strong, and
this morning's echo was all clear,

122
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:28,478
and his heart pump is
doing everything it should.

123
00:04:28,502 --> 00:04:30,952
<i>Link, buddy, that's great.
You're getting better.</i>

124
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:32,838
When can Ivy come back in here?

125
00:04:32,906 --> 00:04:34,006
Um...

126
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,140
Well, she's still sick,

127
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:38,233
so she needs to stay
in there a little bit longer.

128
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,980
Unfortunately,
Ivy's still in rejection.

129
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:43,899
UNOS has her
listed as status 1B,

130
00:04:43,967 --> 00:04:46,834
and we're monitoring
her very closely.

131
00:04:51,975 --> 00:04:53,469
Page when we know
the heart's a go...

132
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:54,776
Here you go, Doctor.

133
00:04:54,844 --> 00:04:56,544
So, Dr. Yang won't
be back today?

134
00:04:56,613 --> 00:04:57,907
Well, I haven't
heard from her, and

135
00:04:57,931 --> 00:04:59,142
I can't exactly
postpone the surgery.

136
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:01,783
Has anyone heard from her?

137
00:05:01,852 --> 00:05:05,012
Just make sure that
Frankie's ready and prepped.

138
00:05:06,874 --> 00:05:08,173
Why are you hovering?

139
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,688
Thank you. What's
wrong with your face?

140
00:05:11,712 --> 00:05:12,838
I like your hair.

141
00:05:12,862 --> 00:05:13,912
Oh, what did you do?

142
00:05:15,632 --> 00:05:16,864
Radiology's backed up.

143
00:05:16,934 --> 00:05:18,344
Can you get me in line
for the next available MRI?

144
00:05:18,368 --> 00:05:19,400
Sure.

145
00:05:19,469 --> 00:05:20,780
Hey, Shepherd,
you're back to more

146
00:05:20,804 --> 00:05:22,048
of a regular surgical
schedule, right?

147
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:23,772
Yes. Why?

148
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,217
The foundation asked
me to report on the status

149
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:26,770
of our surgeon-run
research projects.

150
00:05:26,794 --> 00:05:28,388
Want to see which ones
are actually getting results.

151
00:05:28,412 --> 00:05:30,089
So, what, they can start
shutting other ones down?

152
00:05:30,113 --> 00:05:32,280
Neurological research
takes a really long time.

153
00:05:32,366 --> 00:05:34,343
I'm looking at all the
projects, Derek, not just yours.

154
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:36,112
We can start making
these decisions ourselves

155
00:05:36,136 --> 00:05:37,763
or wait for the
foundation to do it for us.

156
00:05:37,787 --> 00:05:41,522
Remember, Dr. Torres and I
have a presidential seal of approval.

157
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:48,396
You're back!

158
00:05:48,465 --> 00:05:49,909
You're gonna want to
stay away from me today.

159
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:51,544
Where's Cristina? She
must be devastated.

160
00:05:51,568 --> 00:05:52,878
If I were her, I'd be face-first

161
00:05:52,902 --> 00:05:54,163
in a pile of chocolate
chip cookies.

162
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,353
Stop it!

163
00:05:55,422 --> 00:05:56,732
Cristina Yang
doesn't need your pity!

164
00:05:56,756 --> 00:05:58,618
She was robbed!
And you robbed her!

165
00:05:58,642 --> 00:06:00,074
Oh, I did?

166
00:06:00,144 --> 00:06:02,155
Yes! You! You're an
Avery by association!

167
00:06:02,179 --> 00:06:04,924
That pack of fools can't tell
their asses from their elbows,

168
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:06,543
never mind an
award-winning surgeon

169
00:06:06,567 --> 00:06:08,199
versus some halfwit

170
00:06:08,268 --> 00:06:11,588
who tinkers with science
kits in his mother's basement!

171
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:13,198
I told you to stay away
from me today, didn't I?

172
00:06:13,222 --> 00:06:14,305
Mmm-hmm.

173
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:15,551
When did all this happen?

174
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:16,652
About a month ago.

175
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:18,210
Lebackes approached me.

176
00:06:18,278 --> 00:06:20,890
I've been doing work
with him on my off time.

177
00:06:20,914 --> 00:06:22,308
He thinks I could
make a really good fit.

178
00:06:22,332 --> 00:06:24,165
So you've already
decided? You're leaving?

179
00:06:24,251 --> 00:06:26,000
No. I don't know.

180
00:06:26,069 --> 00:06:27,847
I mean, my fellowship
is almost over, so...

181
00:06:27,871 --> 00:06:29,871
Well, when do they
need to know by?

182
00:06:31,091 --> 00:06:33,741
Tonight.

183
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,650
What, you're not gonna
yell at me or something?

184
00:06:37,047 --> 00:06:38,524
Frankie's heart is on its way.

185
00:06:38,548 --> 00:06:41,660
See, we just don't understand.

186
00:06:41,684 --> 00:06:43,029
Two days ago, he was fine,

187
00:06:43,053 --> 00:06:44,831
and now he's struggling
to even breathe.

188
00:06:44,855 --> 00:06:46,683
You gave him chemo last night.

189
00:06:46,707 --> 00:06:48,384
Is that what's making
him so much sicker?

190
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:50,286
I mean, I know it has something
to do with the gene therapy.

191
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:52,154
Well, the chemo
obliterated the bone marrow,

192
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:53,840
which contained the
enzyme-deficient cells.

193
00:06:53,864 --> 00:06:56,064
Such a mild dose
wouldn't make him sick.

194
00:06:56,099 --> 00:06:57,810
We believe he picked
up a viral infection.

195
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:00,185
How? He's in isolation!

196
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,103
He has no contact with anyone.

197
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:03,221
How is that possible?

198
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:04,956
Your son has no immune system.

199
00:07:05,025 --> 00:07:07,509
We've taken every
precaution, but this is a hospital.

200
00:07:07,578 --> 00:07:09,895
Look at him! He's barely alive!

201
00:07:09,963 --> 00:07:11,546
Maybe we should
just stop everything

202
00:07:11,632 --> 00:07:13,481
and let him get
better, just let him rest.

203
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:15,161
Remember, we went through this.

204
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:17,330
He could get sicker
before he got better.

205
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:19,371
We're still on track
for this afternoon.

206
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,657
When you inject an HIV virus
into our very sick little boy.

207
00:07:22,726 --> 00:07:24,926
Inject a deactivated HIV...

208
00:07:24,994 --> 00:07:26,561
Okay, look, look,

209
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:30,232
we just need to hang
on a little while longer.

210
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,066
We're almost there.

211
00:07:32,135 --> 00:07:33,535
Braden.

212
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:40,130
Let's give this kid a
new heart, shall we?

213
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,326
10 blade.

214
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,360
I've got it, Dr. Russell.

215
00:07:45,415 --> 00:07:46,481
Yang!

216
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:48,733
This is a surprise.
When'd you get back?

217
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:50,814
Thank you for covering,
Russell, but I've got it from here.

218
00:07:50,838 --> 00:07:52,215
I'm already scrubbed
and ready to go.

219
00:07:52,239 --> 00:07:53,649
Why don't you take a
load off? You must be tired.

220
00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:56,157
I've followed Frankie McNeil
since day one. Thank you.

221
00:07:57,911 --> 00:08:00,271
Tough loss last night, Yang.

222
00:08:00,797 --> 00:08:02,080
Must have stung.

223
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:05,290
Better luck next time.

224
00:08:08,355 --> 00:08:10,595
It was an honor
just to be nominated.

225
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:14,592
10 blade.

226
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:43,638
What on earth are
you doing here?

227
00:08:43,707 --> 00:08:45,685
Oh!

228
00:08:45,709 --> 00:08:47,275
I like to keep you guessing.

229
00:08:47,344 --> 00:08:48,988
Ooh. You better get in here

230
00:08:49,012 --> 00:08:51,496
before I do something
that will embarrass Henry.

231
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:56,084
Oh, wow!

232
00:08:56,152 --> 00:08:57,551
Ooh! Mmm.

233
00:09:00,056 --> 00:09:01,536
Mmm. I should
surprise you more often.

234
00:09:03,243 --> 00:09:04,459
Well, I'm not that surprised.

235
00:09:04,528 --> 00:09:05,704
How come?

236
00:09:05,728 --> 00:09:08,530
I thought you might
show up and poke around,

237
00:09:08,598 --> 00:09:11,917
trying to figure out why
Dr. Yang didn't get her award.

238
00:09:11,985 --> 00:09:14,463
Oh, please. I planned
this trip a long time ago.

239
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:16,599
I figured you'd be
exhausted from the ceremony

240
00:09:16,623 --> 00:09:18,205
and need a little getaway.

241
00:09:18,274 --> 00:09:21,375
You didn't plan it as a victory
lap to celebrate Yang's big win?

242
00:09:21,444 --> 00:09:23,911
Mmm... That would
have been a nice feature.

243
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,564
Yeah.

244
00:09:25,632 --> 00:09:28,466
But I think the weekend
will have other nice features.

245
00:09:28,535 --> 00:09:29,768
Oh. Really?

246
00:09:31,271 --> 00:09:32,749
So, why don't you
finish what you're doing?

247
00:09:32,773 --> 00:09:34,783
Mmm-hmm. I'll sit here
and watch the magic,

248
00:09:34,807 --> 00:09:36,924
and then I'll take
you to dinner.

249
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:38,473
Mmm.

250
00:09:38,928 --> 00:09:40,628
Yes, Dr. Webber.

251
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,386
Hey. Hi. How are you?

252
00:09:49,222 --> 00:09:50,422
Good.

253
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:53,508
How'd you sleep?

254
00:09:53,577 --> 00:09:54,671
Fine, thanks.

255
00:09:54,695 --> 00:09:56,556
Have you talked to
Cristina? Is she okay?

256
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:57,807
I really thought that she had...

257
00:09:57,831 --> 00:10:00,231
Yeah, I know. I
was shocked, too.

258
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,817
Um, so, I need to
come home tonight.

259
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:06,027
You want to talk? I...

260
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:08,484
I need my iPod.

261
00:10:08,508 --> 00:10:09,535
I went running
today, and I wished...

262
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:10,559
Sure. Sure.

263
00:10:12,512 --> 00:10:13,911
Are you okay?

264
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,057
You look...

265
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:16,447
Stressed. I'm a little stressed.

266
00:10:16,516 --> 00:10:18,566
I got to compile a
report for the foundation

267
00:10:18,635 --> 00:10:20,768
on the value of people's
research projects,

268
00:10:20,837 --> 00:10:23,588
'cause we're not gonna be able
to keep all of them, I don't think.

269
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,324
Wow.

270
00:10:26,393 --> 00:10:27,992
What?

271
00:10:28,061 --> 00:10:30,489
You guys deny her the
award and not 24 hours later,

272
00:10:30,513 --> 00:10:32,358
you're talking about
shutting down her research?

273
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:34,176
You know that that was
her life's dream, right?

274
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,344
That's not what we're doing.

275
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:36,679
They're looking for ways to...

276
00:10:36,703 --> 00:10:38,447
Classy move, Avery family.

277
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,911
Way to make it all
about the medicine.

278
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:44,609
Okay. What do we got?

279
00:10:44,678 --> 00:10:45,943
Sam Roane, 23.

280
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:47,856
Been walking cross-country
for the past three months,

281
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,246
stopping only for sleep

282
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:50,610
and the pickup
that took him out.

283
00:10:50,634 --> 00:10:52,734
Hypotensive with
multiple blunt trauma

284
00:10:52,803 --> 00:10:55,020
and deformity to the
right lower extremity.

285
00:10:55,088 --> 00:10:56,621
Paramedics splinted
him in the field.

286
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:59,140
So, three months? That
means you started walking from...

287
00:10:59,209 --> 00:11:00,369
Wilmington. CALLIE: Wow.

288
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:02,143
Were you, uh,
walking for charity?

289
00:11:02,212 --> 00:11:04,189
No. I mean, I fell in with a few
cancer groups along the way,

290
00:11:04,213 --> 00:11:05,463
you know, for the snacks,

291
00:11:05,532 --> 00:11:07,509
but it was more about really
committing to something

292
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:09,245
and following it
through to the end.

293
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:10,735
And then I got hit by a truck.

294
00:11:12,389 --> 00:11:14,566
Okay, the femur fracture must
have transected the femoral artery.

295
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,001
That's why he's so hypotensive.

296
00:11:16,025 --> 00:11:17,186
He is losing all his blood

297
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:18,320
volume into his thigh. Mmm-hmm.

298
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,694
Foot is pulseless and cold.

299
00:11:19,763 --> 00:11:21,924
We need to do an angio
in the OR. Let's move now.

300
00:11:21,948 --> 00:11:23,447
I mean, they screwed her!

301
00:11:23,517 --> 00:11:25,049
And I was ready to make a scene,

302
00:11:25,118 --> 00:11:27,351
but she just sat
there in her seat.

303
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,353
She clapped for him.
She applauded him, Derek!

304
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:30,472
No, go ahead. Get it out.

305
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,017
And now I can't
even get a hold of her.

306
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:33,552
I mean, she could
still be in Boston.

307
00:11:33,576 --> 00:11:35,259
She could be in Mexico.

308
00:11:35,328 --> 00:11:36,772
I have no idea where...

309
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:39,180
She's in OR 1. Thank God!

310
00:11:41,884 --> 00:11:43,467
Is that a spinal schwannoma?

311
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:44,769
It is.

312
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:46,049
Extended into the
retropleural space?

313
00:11:46,073 --> 00:11:47,073
Mmm-hmm.

314
00:11:48,592 --> 00:11:49,719
Is that for me?

315
00:11:49,743 --> 00:11:51,042
We're overdue for a date.

316
00:11:51,111 --> 00:11:54,779
OR 3, you in fresh scrubs,
me in a ferryboat scrub cap.

317
00:11:54,847 --> 00:11:56,314
You in?

318
00:11:56,366 --> 00:11:58,077
Well, this could take
hours. What about the kids?

319
00:11:58,101 --> 00:11:59,812
Amy's with them. We have
a babysitter named Amy?

320
00:11:59,836 --> 00:12:01,063
Amy my sister. The junkie?

321
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:03,021
She's a recovering
addict, and she loves kids.

322
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:04,388
I've only been gone a day.

323
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:06,657
The tumor involves
the great vessels.

324
00:12:09,595 --> 00:12:11,730
I know what you're
doing. Mmm-hmm.

325
00:12:11,798 --> 00:12:13,781
And it's working. Mmm-hmm.

326
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:15,983
Yeah, his femur's toast.
He'll need an ex fix.

327
00:12:16,052 --> 00:12:17,435
SFA's transected.

328
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:19,131
Okay. We got to relieve
the pressure on this leg.

329
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:20,333
I just heard from Grey,

330
00:12:20,357 --> 00:12:22,273
Cristina's in OR 1
doing a heart transplant.

331
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:23,608
Karev and Robbins are with her.

332
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:24,853
Hey, Wilson, did
you happen to put on

333
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:26,222
boot covers before
you came in here?

334
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:28,246
Why would I...

335
00:12:29,983 --> 00:12:31,616
Okay. I get it.

336
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:33,752
It's in my socks.

337
00:12:35,055 --> 00:12:36,865
Oh! That never gets old.

338
00:12:40,393 --> 00:12:44,695
I just feel like it's one thing
after another, after another.

339
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:48,032
I don't know how you
do it with three sick kids.

340
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:50,502
I'm barely keeping it
together with just one.

341
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:52,137
Teresa? Hmm?

342
00:12:52,205 --> 00:12:54,445
Uh, do you have those
consent forms for this afternoon?

343
00:12:54,474 --> 00:12:56,202
Oh. Yeah, I forgot. Hang on.

344
00:12:56,226 --> 00:12:57,741
Yeah. Take your time.

345
00:12:57,811 --> 00:13:01,312
I mean, you're their parent.
You're who they trust.

346
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,608
But you can't
actually help them.

347
00:13:03,632 --> 00:13:05,667
That's the doctor's job.

348
00:13:05,735 --> 00:13:08,502
Then weeks go
by, and all this stuff

349
00:13:08,572 --> 00:13:10,683
that's supposed to
be making them better

350
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:12,490
keeps not working.

351
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:14,303
And I just, I start to wonder,

352
00:13:14,327 --> 00:13:16,839
"Do these doctors really
know what's best for my kids?

353
00:13:16,863 --> 00:13:18,362
"Am I just kidding myself?

354
00:13:18,431 --> 00:13:20,751
"Will we ever go home?"

355
00:13:24,019 --> 00:13:25,297
Sorry, Doctor. No offense.

356
00:13:25,321 --> 00:13:26,871
Nope. None taken.

357
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:29,606
Uh, Teresa, I'm sorry.

358
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:32,009
You just have a
couple more to sign.

359
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:39,261
Removing cross clamp

360
00:13:39,285 --> 00:13:40,763
to re-establish blood flow.

361
00:13:40,787 --> 00:13:42,898
I don't see one tear, one
leak. You did it perfectly.

362
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:45,589
I mean, I've really never seen
such an efficient anastomosis.

363
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:47,419
Look, Karev. Awesome job, Yang.

364
00:13:49,512 --> 00:13:50,723
Inspiring. Flawless.

365
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:51,996
Charge it to 20.

366
00:13:57,353 --> 00:13:59,565
Should be pumping
any minute now.

367
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:01,133
How long does it take?

368
00:14:01,157 --> 00:14:02,951
Usually, it's pretty much
right after restoring blood flow,

369
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:04,141
so eyes on the field.

370
00:14:04,211 --> 00:14:05,688
This is not something
you want to miss

371
00:14:05,712 --> 00:14:07,111
on your first transplant.

372
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:17,755
So...

373
00:14:17,824 --> 00:14:20,144
Shouldn't it be
contracting by now?

374
00:14:20,393 --> 00:14:21,525
Dr. Yang?

375
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:22,738
Starting cardiac massage.

376
00:14:22,762 --> 00:14:24,962
Pacing wires now.
Get me intracardiac epi.

377
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:28,646
Come on, come on, come on. Beat.

378
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:32,714
What's UNOS saying?

379
00:14:32,738 --> 00:14:33,999
We're waiting on a call back.

380
00:14:34,023 --> 00:14:35,267
I don't understand.
How does that happen?

381
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,035
They sent us a
freaking lemon heart.

382
00:14:37,059 --> 00:14:39,659
They must have injured it when
they were moving it from the donor.

383
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:44,760
It's UNOS. They've located
another heart that's a match.

384
00:14:44,784 --> 00:14:45,845
It's in Portland.

385
00:14:45,869 --> 00:14:47,596
How often does that happen?

386
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,898
Karev and I will go get it. We
can't risk another screw-up.

387
00:14:48,922 --> 00:14:50,499
Well, both of us don't
need to... Now. Let's go.

388
00:14:50,523 --> 00:14:52,134
Cristina, you okay? Yeah.

389
00:14:52,158 --> 00:14:54,286
Dr. Yang, Frankie's already
been on bypass for hours.

390
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,155
And she's gonna stay
on it. Keep monitoring her.

391
00:14:56,179 --> 00:14:58,379
Page me if anything changes.

392
00:14:59,865 --> 00:15:01,432
All right.

393
00:15:01,501 --> 00:15:02,600
That's it.

394
00:15:02,669 --> 00:15:03,779
Shall we?

395
00:15:03,803 --> 00:15:06,537
You really thought
I would come here

396
00:15:06,606 --> 00:15:09,073
and question why Yang
didn't get a Harper Avery?

397
00:15:09,142 --> 00:15:12,777
Well, you're a proud papa.
She's your prize student.

398
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:14,957
I know it's important to you.

399
00:15:14,981 --> 00:15:17,648
It's important to
the whole hospital.

400
00:15:17,717 --> 00:15:19,227
And you're an
investor in that hospital,

401
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:20,696
so I think it'd be
important to you, too.

402
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,586
It is.

403
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:24,936
That's why it's good that
there is an impartial committee.

404
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:26,374
Well...

405
00:15:26,442 --> 00:15:27,992
"Well" what?

406
00:15:28,061 --> 00:15:29,627
It's not that impartial.

407
00:15:29,696 --> 00:15:33,614
Look, it makes no
sense that she lost.

408
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:36,384
See, I read her paper, I read
every other nominated paper.

409
00:15:36,452 --> 00:15:37,901
There's no comparison...

410
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:40,771
Unless there was some
statistical calculation she blew,

411
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:44,558
some gross error buried
way down in the data.

412
00:15:44,627 --> 00:15:46,144
You know as well as I do

413
00:15:46,212 --> 00:15:48,612
none of them even holds a
candle to what Yang's been doing.

414
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:54,063
Number one, I'm
glad you're alive.

415
00:15:54,087 --> 00:15:55,864
Number two, who do
you want me to go after?

416
00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:57,933
Because I'm in your corner. Mer.

417
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,602
But I can't be in your corner
if you disappear on me.

418
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:00,891
Mer, not now.

419
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,288
Dr. Yang, they're asking
for you in the CCU.

420
00:16:02,312 --> 00:16:03,911
Ivy McNeil's sats
dropped below 70.

421
00:16:07,834 --> 00:16:11,096
Dr. Yang, you're
back. Thank God.

422
00:16:14,107 --> 00:16:15,172
Ivy's heart is failing.

423
00:16:15,241 --> 00:16:16,601
She has a lot of
fluid in her lungs.

424
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:17,992
I need to intubate right away.

425
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,178
Prepare for RSI with 15
of etomidate and 10 of vec.

426
00:16:20,246 --> 00:16:23,014
Link. Link, don't look, buddy.

427
00:16:26,502 --> 00:16:27,935
I'm here, honey.

428
00:16:29,205 --> 00:16:30,538
Push etomidate.

429
00:16:30,607 --> 00:16:32,200
<i>I barely got two
words out of her.</i>

430
00:16:32,224 --> 00:16:33,824
She's obviously not okay, right?

431
00:16:33,893 --> 00:16:36,271
You said she got pulled
into an emergency.

432
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:38,195
I'm sure she's fine.

433
00:16:38,264 --> 00:16:39,975
You know, this is the most
time we've spent together,

434
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,493
just the two of us, in weeks.

435
00:16:41,517 --> 00:16:42,628
It's really nice.

436
00:16:42,652 --> 00:16:44,668
We have to do it more often.

437
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:46,253
Grey?

438
00:16:46,322 --> 00:16:47,649
Should have left
a tie on the door.

439
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:49,551
About your portal
vein project...

440
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:51,670
Do you really need lab
staff five days a week?

441
00:16:51,694 --> 00:16:53,589
Yes. Say yes. Yes. Why?

442
00:16:53,613 --> 00:16:55,224
The foundation is
trimming research. What?

443
00:16:55,248 --> 00:16:56,808
No, no, no. They're just
looking... The hell they are.

444
00:16:56,832 --> 00:16:57,998
The Harper Avery Foundation

445
00:16:58,067 --> 00:17:00,084
doesn't make any
decisions about this hospital.

446
00:17:00,153 --> 00:17:01,335
If there's one thing

447
00:17:01,404 --> 00:17:03,587
the Harper Avery
Foundation can't do well,

448
00:17:03,639 --> 00:17:05,351
it's decide who
should get something.

449
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:06,640
Okay, I am just...

450
00:17:06,709 --> 00:17:09,038
Tell them that if they cut
my funding, I cut their tires.

451
00:17:09,062 --> 00:17:10,527
Cristina Yang
deserved that award,

452
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:13,564
not Dr. Nobody
Sucksalot from Hopkins.

453
00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:16,484
And tell them in short
sentences with little, tiny words,

454
00:17:16,553 --> 00:17:19,086
because they are boneheads!

455
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:24,391
And we were having so much fun.

456
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,643
Jackson and I aren't
having just a fight.

457
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,312
This is important.
It's not something

458
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:31,215
that can be just glossed
over, ignored, or fixed.

459
00:17:31,284 --> 00:17:33,617
I can't pretend like
nothing's wrong.

460
00:17:33,686 --> 00:17:35,164
Yeah, I know. I know.

461
00:17:35,188 --> 00:17:36,798
You said all that last night,

462
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:39,117
then again this
morning over breakfast.

463
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:41,792
And now. You're
saying it all again now.

464
00:17:41,845 --> 00:17:43,238
Hey. Wow. Look at that.

465
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:44,962
His ex fix really
looks ready to go.

466
00:17:45,031 --> 00:17:46,763
Sadly, I think our
work is done here.

467
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:49,795
Wha... You're leaving?
You're not leaving.

468
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:51,747
Don't we need to review the
measurements with imaging?

469
00:17:51,771 --> 00:17:53,465
No, we do. We
do. Uh, it's just...

470
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:55,083
We should really stay out
of Kepner and Hunt's way,

471
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:56,657
so we're gonna
do it in radiology,

472
00:17:56,726 --> 00:17:58,504
where there are bigger screens
and better lighting. Sound good?

473
00:17:58,528 --> 00:17:59,938
Well, we're almost
done here, so...

474
00:17:59,962 --> 00:18:02,362
Take your time.
Let's go, Wilson.

475
00:18:03,432 --> 00:18:05,544
We should take him
home! Let him get better!

476
00:18:05,568 --> 00:18:07,535
Let this treatment
get more established!

477
00:18:07,604 --> 00:18:09,069
We don't have to
be the guinea pig!

478
00:18:09,138 --> 00:18:11,606
But the treatment can
bring us our son back.

479
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:12,952
He can live a normal life.

480
00:18:12,976 --> 00:18:14,024
Or it could kill him!

481
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,794
They say it won't,
but this therapy

482
00:18:16,863 --> 00:18:17,906
is made with HIV.

483
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,141
That doesn't freak you out?

484
00:18:19,165 --> 00:18:20,231
It's deactivated!

485
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,676
Do you even know
what that means?

486
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,562
Do you know what that means?

487
00:18:23,586 --> 00:18:25,097
Excuse me. I need to do
one final blood test on Braden.

488
00:18:25,121 --> 00:18:27,405
No! No more blood
draws! No more injections!

489
00:18:27,473 --> 00:18:29,051
Nothing else! We're done!

490
00:18:29,075 --> 00:18:30,975
This treatment is too
much! It's killing him!

491
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:33,188
Okay, Teresa, look, I
know that you're scared.

492
00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:34,228
Teresa...

493
00:18:34,296 --> 00:18:36,497
No, tell Dr. Bailey we
have changed our minds.

494
00:18:36,566 --> 00:18:39,066
You're not injecting Braden
with anything today. You got it?

495
00:18:44,841 --> 00:18:46,585
The last time that
we were on a plane...

496
00:18:46,609 --> 00:18:48,721
Can we not talk about the
last time you were on a plane?

497
00:18:48,745 --> 00:18:49,977
No.

498
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:52,791
Alex, the last time that we
were on a plane together.

499
00:18:52,815 --> 00:18:54,849
The first time we met. Look...

500
00:18:54,917 --> 00:18:56,416
I know you brought
me on this plane

501
00:18:56,485 --> 00:18:58,252
to talk me out
of taking this job.

502
00:18:59,255 --> 00:19:00,821
We'll be in Portland soon.

503
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:02,768
Just get it over with and
say what you're gonna say.

504
00:19:02,792 --> 00:19:04,174
It's not like I can go anywhere.

505
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:06,723
We were on our
way to pick up a liver

506
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:08,139
and a small bowel
for a 10-year-old...

507
00:19:08,163 --> 00:19:09,491
And now you
think I'm selling out,

508
00:19:09,515 --> 00:19:11,026
that I'm choosing
money over substance,

509
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:13,401
and that it's a waste of
my talent or whatever...

510
00:19:13,469 --> 00:19:14,601
That there's more to life

511
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:16,348
than nice schedules
and a big, fat paycheck.

512
00:19:16,372 --> 00:19:17,755
Well, I've thought
about it hard.

513
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:19,701
You've been awesome, but I've
already stayed here once for you.

514
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:22,926
I have to start thinking about
myself, about what I want.

515
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:24,339
I've worked hard,
and I deserve this.

516
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:26,630
I deserve to think about
myself for once, okay?

517
00:19:32,938 --> 00:19:34,221
Yang is a robot.

518
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:36,207
If I just lost the Harper
Avery, I'd be AWOL,

519
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:39,142
in my bed with a
bottle of Scotch.

520
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:42,513
Although, she did just throw
pickups across a crowded OR.

521
00:19:42,582 --> 00:19:44,047
Yang's a surgeon.

522
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:46,995
She cares more about her
patients than stupid awards.

523
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,285
What's the latest ABG?

524
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:50,888
Uh, pH is 7.15,

525
00:19:50,957 --> 00:19:52,489
pCO2 is 52.

526
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:54,024
Crap. She's acidotic.

527
00:19:54,093 --> 00:19:55,904
Push bicarb and
increase her sweep.

528
00:19:55,928 --> 00:19:57,239
Okay. SHANE: Okay, good. Good.

529
00:19:57,263 --> 00:19:59,041
Shane, she's bleeding.

530
00:19:59,065 --> 00:20:01,076
It's coming from one
of the suture lines.

531
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,549
Page Dr. Yang now!

532
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:04,563
Ivy's lungs are doing
better after the intubation,

533
00:20:04,587 --> 00:20:06,253
but I need to
place a special line

534
00:20:06,322 --> 00:20:08,166
to get a more accurate
measurement of her heart.

535
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:09,718
You may want to leave
during this procedure.

536
00:20:09,742 --> 00:20:11,275
No. I'm staying. I want to stay.

537
00:20:11,327 --> 00:20:13,678
You ran in here after
Frankie's surgery. Is she...

538
00:20:13,746 --> 00:20:16,697
There was a complication
with Frankie's donor heart,

539
00:20:16,766 --> 00:20:18,343
but a second one
has been located,

540
00:20:18,367 --> 00:20:19,733
and it's on its way.

541
00:20:19,802 --> 00:20:21,963
I just wanted to keep Frankie
in the OR until it arrives.

542
00:20:21,987 --> 00:20:23,954
What? Is that safe?
Is she gonna be okay?

543
00:20:24,022 --> 00:20:25,600
She's being closely monitored.

544
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:29,093
Dr. Yang, Dr. Ross and Dr. Murphy
are on the phone from OR 1.

545
00:20:32,065 --> 00:20:33,441
Put them on speaker.

546
00:20:33,465 --> 00:20:36,679
Ross, update me. I'm
here with Frankie's dad.

547
00:20:36,703 --> 00:20:38,414
<i>Frankie's bleeding from
one of her suture lines.</i>

548
00:20:38,438 --> 00:20:40,137
<i>And she's really acidotic.</i>

549
00:20:40,206 --> 00:20:42,967
Jon, you should
step out. I'm staying.

550
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:46,605
Ross, did you push
bicarb? <i>We did.</i>

551
00:20:46,629 --> 00:20:47,928
How are her coags?

552
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:49,341
<i>Stable, but this bleed
isn't slowing down.</i>

553
00:20:49,365 --> 00:20:50,876
Okay, well, you need
to stop that bleeding.

554
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,132
If she continues to bleed...

555
00:20:52,201 --> 00:20:53,618
<i>The triad of death. We know.</i>

556
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:55,936
<i>I'm so sorry, sir.</i>

557
00:20:56,005 --> 00:20:58,405
Okay, throw a
horizontal mattress stitch,

558
00:20:58,474 --> 00:21:00,090
but careful with her tissues.

559
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:02,192
They're extremely
friable, so soft hands.

560
00:21:03,396 --> 00:21:04,706
You're on the right
side of the table.

561
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:05,957
<i>You have one chance, or else</i>

562
00:21:05,981 --> 00:21:08,065
<i>you could rip through the aorta,</i>

563
00:21:08,134 --> 00:21:09,211
<i>which is essential to connecting
the new heart when it arrives.</i>

564
00:21:09,235 --> 00:21:10,651
Nope.

565
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,330
<i>Just take a breath,
just throw the stitch.</i>

566
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:13,721
You can do this.

567
00:21:13,789 --> 00:21:15,555
I've never put a
horizontal mattress

568
00:21:15,624 --> 00:21:17,591
in an aorta before.
Only in a bowel.

569
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:19,521
From this side, I'll just tear
through her native aorta.

570
00:21:19,545 --> 00:21:20,656
Well, what if I tear through it?

571
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,245
You won't!

572
00:21:22,315 --> 00:21:23,848
You can do this.

573
00:21:35,111 --> 00:21:36,777
Ross! Murphy!

574
00:21:40,216 --> 00:21:42,144
<i>We got it. We stopped the bleed.</i>

575
00:21:42,168 --> 00:21:43,688
She's fine.

576
00:21:44,236 --> 00:21:45,586
They're both fine.

577
00:21:49,842 --> 00:21:51,158
<i>She gets results.</i>

578
00:21:51,227 --> 00:21:53,277
She always has, and
this is no exception.

579
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,380
Make me understand,

580
00:21:56,449 --> 00:21:58,799
because my read is that
Yang should have clearly won.

581
00:21:58,867 --> 00:22:00,183
I mean, what am I missing?

582
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:01,797
From where I'm standing,
she had it by a mile.

583
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:04,166
Richard, honestly, tell
me you're not this naive.

584
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:05,467
Well, what is that
supposed to mean?

585
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:06,890
The Harper Avery Foundation

586
00:22:06,959 --> 00:22:09,794
co-owns the hospital
Cristina Yang works for.

587
00:22:11,147 --> 00:22:13,547
She could never win that award.

588
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:21,383
I don't know how long
this stitch is gonna hold.

589
00:22:21,407 --> 00:22:22,773
PH and bicarb?

590
00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:24,174
7.0 and 14.

591
00:22:24,243 --> 00:22:26,038
Dr. Yang, now she's
oozing from the IVC.

592
00:22:26,062 --> 00:22:27,456
I see it, Shane. Aren't
we gonna put in a suture?

593
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,790
If we just keep
throwing in stitches,

594
00:22:28,814 --> 00:22:29,908
she'll dissect all
over the place.

595
00:22:29,932 --> 00:22:31,393
We have to get
Frankie off this table.

596
00:22:31,417 --> 00:22:32,610
How? She's getting a transplant.

597
00:22:32,634 --> 00:22:33,896
In this state, she'll
never survive it.

598
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,302
First, she gets a lemon heart,

599
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:37,450
and now we don't know if
the new one's gonna make it?

600
00:22:38,123 --> 00:22:39,155
Wait. Is that Robbins?

601
00:22:39,225 --> 00:22:40,424
<i>How we doing?</i>

602
00:22:40,492 --> 00:22:42,304
The heart is out, and
we're on the move.

603
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:50,345
Want to let the
coordinator know?

604
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:52,920
Oh. Phone the pilot. Let
him know we're on our way.

605
00:22:54,656 --> 00:22:56,001
So, this is how
it's gonna be now?

606
00:22:56,025 --> 00:22:57,569
Radio silence till the
end of my fellowship?

607
00:22:57,593 --> 00:22:59,993
That's how you're
gonna leave things?

608
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:04,031
Alex, I brought you here today

609
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:07,834
because I trusted your skills
to properly procure this heart.

610
00:23:07,903 --> 00:23:10,704
And then we got on that
plane, and I started feeling sad

611
00:23:10,772 --> 00:23:13,057
because you're leaving
soon and I will miss you.

612
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:14,775
I didn't bring you
today to scold you.

613
00:23:14,843 --> 00:23:16,577
I'm proud of you
and I'm happy for you,

614
00:23:16,646 --> 00:23:19,113
and all I wanted was to share
a freaking memory, okay?

615
00:23:19,181 --> 00:23:20,631
I was being sentimental!

616
00:23:22,768 --> 00:23:23,768
Oh.

617
00:23:28,157 --> 00:23:29,534
You know, if I take the job,

618
00:23:29,558 --> 00:23:30,835
I'm still gonna have
hospital privileges.

619
00:23:30,859 --> 00:23:32,208
You'll see me around.

620
00:23:32,277 --> 00:23:34,645
Shut up, Karev. Moment's ruined.

621
00:23:38,684 --> 00:23:41,251
Just a few more sutures.

622
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,203
You know where he
was when he got hit?

623
00:23:43,271 --> 00:23:45,155
He was crossing Highway 519.

624
00:23:45,224 --> 00:23:47,357
He could see the water.

625
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:49,743
All he wanted to do was
walk from ocean to ocean.

626
00:23:49,812 --> 00:23:51,661
He was just so freaking close.

627
00:23:53,398 --> 00:23:54,542
Okay, let's check the pulse.

628
00:23:54,566 --> 00:23:55,900
It's not fair, you know?

629
00:23:55,968 --> 00:23:58,080
You make a commitment, it's
supposed to mean something,

630
00:23:58,104 --> 00:24:00,671
and then a pickup
truck just takes you out.

631
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:06,343
Hey, you okay?

632
00:24:09,382 --> 00:24:11,332
Sorry.

633
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,066
I just feel like

634
00:24:13,135 --> 00:24:16,821
this fight with Jackson
is, like, the fight,

635
00:24:16,889 --> 00:24:18,289
and I...

636
00:24:18,357 --> 00:24:20,858
I don't know how
we recover from it.

637
00:24:24,263 --> 00:24:25,903
Listen.

638
00:24:27,333 --> 00:24:29,716
Some fights, you
just can't get past.

639
00:24:29,785 --> 00:24:30,996
You know?

640
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:33,681
Like me and Cristina, it
was... It was about kids.

641
00:24:35,007 --> 00:24:36,440
You and Avery?

642
00:24:36,509 --> 00:24:39,026
This is your first fight.

643
00:24:39,095 --> 00:24:40,335
You will get past this,

644
00:24:40,363 --> 00:24:42,474
and then something
else will come along,

645
00:24:42,498 --> 00:24:44,709
and you'll fight
about that, too.

646
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:48,201
And you guys will
recover every time.

647
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:52,356
This is not your pickup truck.

648
00:25:05,237 --> 00:25:07,015
Now that it's thawed,

649
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:09,673
and I've added the
virus to the culture,

650
00:25:09,742 --> 00:25:12,688
I just have to wash them
down and give him the injection

651
00:25:12,712 --> 00:25:14,272
within the next
four to six hours,

652
00:25:14,296 --> 00:25:16,196
and then, theoretically,

653
00:25:16,265 --> 00:25:17,943
that's when the
magic will happen.

654
00:25:17,967 --> 00:25:19,950
See, that's the
problem, though, Bailey.

655
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:21,485
So far, all of
this is theoretical,

656
00:25:21,554 --> 00:25:23,114
and the foundation
needs actual results.

657
00:25:23,138 --> 00:25:24,738
I need you to help me out, okay?

658
00:25:24,807 --> 00:25:26,151
Give me something,
anything concrete,

659
00:25:26,175 --> 00:25:28,625
that shows that your
project is producing results.

660
00:25:28,677 --> 00:25:30,777
No. It will be.

661
00:25:30,846 --> 00:25:33,347
Once I give this
targeted gene therapy

662
00:25:33,415 --> 00:25:35,310
to my bubble
boy, I know it will.

663
00:25:35,334 --> 00:25:36,800
I can feel it.

664
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:38,780
Okay, I can't exactly pitch
that we need to keep your lab

665
00:25:38,804 --> 00:25:40,571
because you have
a feeling, can I?

666
00:25:43,408 --> 00:25:44,519
You said you're
doing this today?

667
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:46,009
Yes, I am.

668
00:25:46,078 --> 00:25:47,522
And it's going to work.

669
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:50,497
Dr. Bailey, do you
have a minute?

670
00:25:50,583 --> 00:25:52,182
You pursued her.
You encouraged her.

671
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:54,050
You all but told her
she was a front runner,

672
00:25:54,086 --> 00:25:56,126
when you knew she was
nothing but window dressing.

673
00:25:56,154 --> 00:25:58,488
She was not window dressing!

674
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:00,702
She was nominated
for a prestigious award

675
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:03,054
that brought publicity
to her and the hospital.

676
00:26:03,078 --> 00:26:04,511
You used her!

677
00:26:04,579 --> 00:26:06,458
She was never gonna win
that damn thing for a second.

678
00:26:06,482 --> 00:26:07,914
Nobody from Grey Sloan Memorial

679
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:10,550
will ever win a Harper
Avery, will they... Ever?

680
00:26:10,619 --> 00:26:12,246
Do you want me to remind you

681
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:14,916
why there is a Grey
Sloan Memorial Hospital?

682
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:18,825
Or should I just take my
$24 million and go home?

683
00:26:18,894 --> 00:26:22,579
What draws me to you,
Richard, is your idealism.

684
00:26:22,648 --> 00:26:26,049
I find it extremely attractive.

685
00:26:26,118 --> 00:26:27,751
But this is business.

686
00:26:27,819 --> 00:26:29,219
And I do not appreciate

687
00:26:29,288 --> 00:26:30,898
your coming all the
way across the country

688
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:32,534
to harangue me about the fact

689
00:26:32,558 --> 00:26:34,836
that your prize pony
didn't get a ribbon!

690
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:37,300
And if it makes you feel better,

691
00:26:37,362 --> 00:26:38,602
she had the votes.

692
00:26:44,036 --> 00:26:46,102
Are you that naive?

693
00:26:46,171 --> 00:26:47,938
Catherine, do you really think

694
00:26:48,006 --> 00:26:50,135
that's why I came
all this way...

695
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:51,725
why I planned an entire weekend

696
00:26:51,793 --> 00:26:53,309
with the things that you love?

697
00:26:53,378 --> 00:26:55,340
Richard... I made
reservations at Cipriani's

698
00:26:55,364 --> 00:26:56,730
because I know
you love it there.

699
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:59,033
And I was going to wait
until just before dessert,

700
00:26:59,101 --> 00:27:01,935
and the waiter was gonna
bring you a glass of champagne.

701
00:27:02,004 --> 00:27:04,221
And I was going to tell
you how much I love you

702
00:27:04,273 --> 00:27:07,408
and how right for
one another we are.

703
00:27:07,476 --> 00:27:10,277
How you make me
feel excited to be alive,

704
00:27:10,345 --> 00:27:12,479
how you give me a reason
to get up each morning

705
00:27:12,548 --> 00:27:15,582
and say a thankful
prayer every night.

706
00:27:15,651 --> 00:27:17,351
I was gonna ask
you to be by my side

707
00:27:17,419 --> 00:27:19,986
for the rest of our lives.

708
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:21,538
That's why I'm here.

709
00:27:22,741 --> 00:27:24,208
That's why I came.

710
00:27:40,625 --> 00:27:42,059
And now I'm leaving.

711
00:27:57,409 --> 00:27:59,409
<i>I'm sorry. What?</i>

712
00:27:59,478 --> 00:28:00,822
You're gonna have to say...

713
00:28:00,846 --> 00:28:02,290
You're gonna have
to say it all again.

714
00:28:02,314 --> 00:28:05,682
Dr. Robbins is on her way
with a new heart for Frankie,

715
00:28:05,751 --> 00:28:07,851
but Ivy's deterioration
has caused her

716
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:10,621
to shoot up to the top
of the transplant list, too.

717
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:15,058
Ivy is also a perfect match
for the donor heart en route.

718
00:28:15,127 --> 00:28:16,671
But that's Frankie's heart.

719
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:19,062
Officially, yes,

720
00:28:19,131 --> 00:28:23,249
but under the circumstances,
the heart could be redirected.

721
00:28:24,069 --> 00:28:26,336
To Ivy?

722
00:28:26,405 --> 00:28:28,300
You want to give
Frankie's heart to Ivy?

723
00:28:28,324 --> 00:28:29,740
No, I don't want...

724
00:28:32,578 --> 00:28:33,944
Medically speaking,

725
00:28:34,013 --> 00:28:35,845
Frankie's condition
is declining rapidly.

726
00:28:36,866 --> 00:28:39,332
Technically, Ivy is more stable,

727
00:28:39,401 --> 00:28:41,563
which would give the heart
a better chance of survival.

728
00:28:41,587 --> 00:28:42,819
Wait. Just...

729
00:28:42,888 --> 00:28:45,255
But if Frankie's worse,

730
00:28:45,324 --> 00:28:47,802
don't you have to give the
heart to the one that's the worst?

731
00:28:47,826 --> 00:28:50,544
Unless she thinks it's a waste.

732
00:28:50,612 --> 00:28:51,922
You think the heart will
be wasted on Frankie?

733
00:28:51,946 --> 00:28:53,630
I just want to explain
all your options.

734
00:28:53,698 --> 00:28:56,617
Our options? This
is our decision?

735
00:28:56,685 --> 00:28:59,503
Wait. You're asking
us to choose?

736
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:01,416
You want us to try to pick

737
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,334
which of our
children gets a heart

738
00:29:03,358 --> 00:29:04,936
and which one doesn't?

739
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,139
Frankie can be fitted with a
total artificial heart for now.

740
00:29:07,163 --> 00:29:09,763
We can't choose.
You have to do it.

741
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:12,232
We have three
children, Dr. Yang...

742
00:29:13,035 --> 00:29:15,268
Three amazing,

743
00:29:16,738 --> 00:29:19,019
beautiful, kind children.

744
00:29:20,209 --> 00:29:21,352
And we can't...

745
00:29:21,376 --> 00:29:25,395
We can't try and pick
between two of them.

746
00:29:25,464 --> 00:29:26,847
We won't.

747
00:29:28,217 --> 00:29:30,617
You have to make this decision.

748
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:32,385
Please.

749
00:29:33,322 --> 00:29:34,654
Please.

750
00:29:41,914 --> 00:29:43,380
There you are.

751
00:29:44,716 --> 00:29:46,650
Frankie's heart is
as stiff as a rock,

752
00:29:46,718 --> 00:29:48,652
and Ivy's got global
systolic dysfunction.

753
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,420
It's absolutely impossible.

754
00:29:50,489 --> 00:29:51,633
Why didn't you call me?

755
00:29:52,758 --> 00:29:54,435
Mer already yelled
at me about this.

756
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:56,554
I'm sorry, okay? I just...

757
00:29:56,578 --> 00:29:58,978
I wanted to be alone, so I left.

758
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:01,264
I'm not talking about...

759
00:30:01,333 --> 00:30:03,650
I just heard about the McNeils.

760
00:30:03,718 --> 00:30:06,520
You should have called me
to help you make this decision.

761
00:30:06,588 --> 00:30:08,388
No surgeon should
have to make a decision

762
00:30:08,457 --> 00:30:10,089
like this on their own.

763
00:30:10,158 --> 00:30:11,692
That's why I'm here.

764
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,137
That's why you have
a chief of surgery.

765
00:30:13,161 --> 00:30:14,956
They're my patients.
I know their status.

766
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,057
I can decide this.

767
00:30:16,081 --> 00:30:17,081
But you don't have to.

768
00:30:19,568 --> 00:30:20,984
Yes, I do.

769
00:30:31,429 --> 00:30:32,907
Prepare to start
sectioning off the vessels.

770
00:30:32,931 --> 00:30:34,359
Is that a Gustafson
artificial heart?

771
00:30:34,383 --> 00:30:36,011
We're getting Frankie
off this table immediately.

772
00:30:36,035 --> 00:30:38,217
And the heart that's on its way?

773
00:30:38,286 --> 00:30:40,320
We're reallocating that
heart. It's going to Ivy.

774
00:30:40,388 --> 00:30:41,508
Russell's prepping her now.

775
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:43,156
Okay, let's move.

776
00:30:43,225 --> 00:30:44,402
<i>You guys gonna
be home for dinner?</i>

777
00:30:44,426 --> 00:30:45,837
Yeah. Sure. Sounds good.

778
00:30:45,861 --> 00:30:47,138
<i>Okay, awesome! Can't wait!</i>

779
00:30:47,162 --> 00:30:48,539
Yeah, neither can we.

780
00:30:48,563 --> 00:30:49,741
Does that mean
what I think it means?

781
00:30:49,765 --> 00:30:51,531
That there's gonna
be dinner waiting for us

782
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,634
on our dining room
table when we get home?

783
00:30:53,702 --> 00:30:55,902
Have we ever even used
our dining room table?

784
00:30:55,971 --> 00:30:57,315
Just remind me
to thank my sister

785
00:30:57,339 --> 00:30:59,579
for letting me actually spend
an entire day with my wife.

786
00:31:01,243 --> 00:31:02,876
Well, she's not a
permanent solution.

787
00:31:02,945 --> 00:31:05,056
Ah, not yet, but we
have a spare bedroom.

788
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,391
We could give her
surgical privileges.

789
00:31:06,415 --> 00:31:08,448
That would give her
less time for childcare.

790
00:31:08,517 --> 00:31:09,927
I know it's not permanent,

791
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:13,164
but we spent an entire day
without dropping any balls.

792
00:31:13,188 --> 00:31:15,033
You know, maybe she'll
even put the kids to bed.

793
00:31:15,057 --> 00:31:16,422
Maybe we could have some wine.

794
00:31:16,491 --> 00:31:18,737
You know, Amy is
making dinner for the kids.

795
00:31:18,761 --> 00:31:21,006
Maybe we have time
for a little... Mmm-hmm.

796
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:23,074
It would be a shame
to end such a great day

797
00:31:23,098 --> 00:31:25,298
with no dessert.

798
00:31:26,552 --> 00:31:27,996
Why aren't you trying
to talk me into staying?

799
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:30,119
Oh, God. Are we still on this?

800
00:31:30,188 --> 00:31:32,533
Can't we just focus on transplanting
the heart we just retrieved?

801
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:34,191
Yeah. Never mind. I'll shut up.

802
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:38,139
Of course I want you to stay.

803
00:31:38,163 --> 00:31:40,191
But this sounds like an
incredible job opportunity,

804
00:31:40,215 --> 00:31:42,477
and you're right. You
did stay here for me once,

805
00:31:42,501 --> 00:31:44,145
and I don't want to
stand in your way again.

806
00:31:44,169 --> 00:31:45,713
So if you want to
leave, you should leave.

807
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:47,815
But not because of
something that I do or don't say.

808
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:51,041
You should leave because
this is the next best thing for you,

809
00:31:51,109 --> 00:31:52,871
and because you're
excited about this job

810
00:31:52,895 --> 00:31:55,375
and you're ready to
go do great things.

811
00:31:56,565 --> 00:31:58,092
And collect a big, fat paycheck.

812
00:31:58,116 --> 00:31:59,149
Really big.

813
00:31:59,217 --> 00:32:01,577
I guess you have
a decision to make.

814
00:32:01,936 --> 00:32:03,976
Don't screw this one up.

815
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,152
Okay, let's transport her.

816
00:32:07,176 --> 00:32:09,020
BP's stable. I'm gonna see
how Russell's doing with Ivy.

817
00:32:09,044 --> 00:32:10,804
Bring in the bed.

818
00:32:11,013 --> 00:32:12,056
What happened?

819
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,457
Ventricular
pressure's up to 200.

820
00:32:13,481 --> 00:32:14,514
She's dissecting.

821
00:32:14,583 --> 00:32:15,760
Now she's plummeted
to 15. What the hell?

822
00:32:15,784 --> 00:32:17,028
Damn it. It ruptured.

823
00:32:17,052 --> 00:32:18,379
Okay, we're gonna
have to reopen her.

824
00:32:18,403 --> 00:32:19,602
Staple remover!

825
00:32:19,671 --> 00:32:21,283
I mean, the thing I
don't understand is,

826
00:32:21,307 --> 00:32:23,518
won't Braden die if he
doesn't get this treatment?

827
00:32:23,542 --> 00:32:26,176
It's possible. So...

828
00:32:26,245 --> 00:32:28,523
Does this happen often
with experimental treatments?

829
00:32:28,547 --> 00:32:30,091
That the parents
or the guardians

830
00:32:30,115 --> 00:32:31,476
just withdraw their consent?

831
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:32,500
Please stop talking.

832
00:32:32,567 --> 00:32:33,712
And then what do I do

833
00:32:33,736 --> 00:32:35,346
with these consent
forms she just signed?

834
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:37,315
I mean, do I shred
them? Do I toss them?

835
00:32:37,339 --> 00:32:38,805
I told you. Stop talking!

836
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:43,059
Uh, I'll take care of those.

837
00:33:01,313 --> 00:33:03,241
Just get one damn
suture to hold.

838
00:33:03,265 --> 00:33:04,764
How's her ventricular pressure?

839
00:33:04,833 --> 00:33:06,233
Zero. OWEN: Pupils?

840
00:33:07,335 --> 00:33:09,602
Fixed and nonreactive.

841
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,834
Cristina. What?

842
00:33:12,858 --> 00:33:15,709
Cristina, we've been at
this for almost an hour.

843
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:24,918
Ivy's transplant went perfectly.

844
00:33:24,986 --> 00:33:27,520
Her post-op echo
is completely normal.

845
00:33:27,589 --> 00:33:29,489
She should be awake soon.

846
00:33:29,558 --> 00:33:31,057
And Frankie?

847
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:36,980
No.

848
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:39,799
No!

849
00:33:40,602 --> 00:33:42,018
It can't be.

850
00:33:45,824 --> 00:33:47,907
You...

851
00:33:47,976 --> 00:33:50,336
Well, how the hell did this...

852
00:33:51,797 --> 00:33:53,880
We trusted you!

853
00:33:53,949 --> 00:33:56,294
What the hell did
you do to our child?

854
00:33:56,318 --> 00:33:58,685
We are so sorry for your loss.

855
00:33:58,754 --> 00:34:00,253
Oh, God!

856
00:34:05,411 --> 00:34:07,577
We need to be with our kids.

857
00:34:28,634 --> 00:34:30,483
Your stitch held. So?

858
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:34,415
I've never seen
vessels that friable,

859
00:34:34,439 --> 00:34:37,307
and I've been around
a lot of diseased hearts.

860
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:39,759
You did an amazing thing.

861
00:34:39,827 --> 00:34:41,227
Shane, the kid died.

862
00:34:41,296 --> 00:34:43,376
It wasn't anything you did.

863
00:34:48,487 --> 00:34:49,914
<i>They want us to be
the center of innovation,</i>

864
00:34:49,938 --> 00:34:51,921
but they don't
want to pay for it.

865
00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:53,167
They love it when we innovate.
They nominated Yang for an award.

866
00:34:53,191 --> 00:34:54,869
She was robbed.
They're boneheads.

867
00:34:54,893 --> 00:34:56,771
We can't give with one
hand and take with the other.

868
00:34:56,795 --> 00:34:58,060
We have to stop this.

869
00:34:58,129 --> 00:35:00,396
There's no stopping this.
Guys, they own the place.

870
00:35:00,466 --> 00:35:02,265
We are just their
managing board.

871
00:35:02,334 --> 00:35:04,551
This conversation is
our relationship now.

872
00:35:04,619 --> 00:35:07,387
Best we can do is try to guide
them to make the right decision.

873
00:35:07,455 --> 00:35:10,706
That's by making our own
decision, as tough as that might be.

874
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:12,342
Look, this is my
report, all right?

875
00:35:12,411 --> 00:35:13,626
All the projects are here.

876
00:35:13,695 --> 00:35:16,846
Operating budgets
versus progress to date.

877
00:35:16,915 --> 00:35:18,481
Best to worst.

878
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:20,590
Take a look, but the
decision is pretty clear to me.

879
00:35:21,803 --> 00:35:24,043
Uh, you got a second?

880
00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:25,766
Never mind. I'll come back.

881
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:26,973
No, no, Alex, come in.

882
00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:30,410
You okay?

883
00:35:30,478 --> 00:35:31,923
Uh, yeah. Yeah.

884
00:35:31,947 --> 00:35:33,191
I just wanted to let you know

885
00:35:33,215 --> 00:35:36,933
that my fellowship
is almost done and...

886
00:35:37,002 --> 00:35:38,301
Uh, well, I got an offer

887
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:40,971
from Lebackes
pediatric surgery clinic,

888
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:43,105
Oliver Lebackes' practice,

889
00:35:43,174 --> 00:35:44,607
and, uh...

890
00:35:44,676 --> 00:35:46,921
Well, I gave it some
serious consideration,

891
00:35:46,945 --> 00:35:48,628
and I've decided to take it.

892
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:52,382
So, I guess this is my notice.

893
00:35:57,556 --> 00:36:00,190
Cristina, please don't
disappear on me again.

894
00:36:00,258 --> 00:36:01,258
Where are you?

895
00:36:01,326 --> 00:36:03,526
Please, just call me.

896
00:36:03,595 --> 00:36:05,528
Hunt. We need to talk.

897
00:36:05,597 --> 00:36:07,878
If it can wait, I
really... No, it can't.

898
00:36:16,274 --> 00:36:17,840
Well?

899
00:36:17,909 --> 00:36:20,054
I almost didn't
go through with it.

900
00:36:20,078 --> 00:36:21,155
But then I did.

901
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:23,380
And I think it's
gonna be good, right?

902
00:36:23,448 --> 00:36:26,282
Are you kidding? It's
gonna be awesome!

903
00:36:26,351 --> 00:36:27,450
Baby!

904
00:36:33,508 --> 00:36:35,286
Oh. Compartment syndrome?

905
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:37,576
Yes. Blood went everywhere.

906
00:36:37,645 --> 00:36:39,056
Mmm. Torres loves that trick.

907
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,825
You should just toss those.

908
00:36:40,849 --> 00:36:41,926
I know. You're right.

909
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:43,761
Why am I scrubbing
those nasty things

910
00:36:43,785 --> 00:36:47,086
when now you can afford
to buy me new ones?

911
00:36:57,665 --> 00:36:59,683
What happened?

912
00:36:59,751 --> 00:37:01,128
Wait. Where are the kids?

913
00:37:01,152 --> 00:37:03,436
They're asleep. Totally fine.

914
00:37:03,505 --> 00:37:04,505
What's wrong?

915
00:37:05,891 --> 00:37:07,924
I can't do this.

916
00:37:07,992 --> 00:37:09,704
The children broke
your sister. Hmm.

917
00:37:09,728 --> 00:37:12,228
No, it's not them.

918
00:37:12,297 --> 00:37:14,641
I didn't come here to see
how your perfect life worked.

919
00:37:14,665 --> 00:37:16,982
I came to see if I could do it.

920
00:37:17,051 --> 00:37:19,335
The whole freaking thing,

921
00:37:19,404 --> 00:37:22,872
the kids and marriage
and the full-time careers.

922
00:37:22,941 --> 00:37:25,258
Because I want that, with James.

923
00:37:26,712 --> 00:37:29,729
And I am wrecked after one day.

924
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:34,200
It goes on the list of things
that I suck at because...

925
00:37:36,537 --> 00:37:38,154
I can't.

926
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:42,636
Well, I knew that was
too good to be true.

927
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:44,171
Why don't you
go fix your sister?

928
00:37:44,195 --> 00:37:46,429
I'll order takeout.

929
00:37:55,673 --> 00:37:57,073
Hey. Hey.

930
00:37:57,142 --> 00:37:58,808
So, you are...

931
00:38:02,047 --> 00:38:03,413
Right.

932
00:38:08,954 --> 00:38:11,235
Uh, I'll see you tomorrow.

933
00:38:12,757 --> 00:38:15,391
April.

934
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:19,913
I said a lot of things the
other night that I regret.

935
00:38:19,981 --> 00:38:21,731
And I'm sorry that
I hurt your feelings.

936
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,860
I'm sorry, too.

937
00:38:22,884 --> 00:38:25,000
Good. So come home. Stay.

938
00:38:25,069 --> 00:38:27,198
This is a conversation we're
always gonna have to have.

939
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:29,100
It's a part of who we are.
It's gonna take some talking.

940
00:38:29,124 --> 00:38:31,341
But we got married.
We love each other.

941
00:38:31,409 --> 00:38:33,876
We made vows to push
through this sort of thing.

942
00:38:33,945 --> 00:38:35,578
I know.

943
00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:37,792
I love you, too, and
we made a commitment.

944
00:38:37,816 --> 00:38:40,784
And if you believe in God,
then you believe he made me.

945
00:38:41,787 --> 00:38:43,787
Your husband.

946
00:38:43,855 --> 00:38:45,955
Who shares your
values, which I do.

947
00:38:46,024 --> 00:38:47,624
I believe we
shouldn't kill or steal.

948
00:38:47,693 --> 00:38:49,170
I believe that you
should be truthful.

949
00:38:49,194 --> 00:38:50,571
I believe that you
should treat others

950
00:38:50,595 --> 00:38:51,706
the way you want to be treated.

951
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:53,095
I agree.

952
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:56,215
So, then, we can push
through this problem.

953
00:38:56,284 --> 00:38:57,967
At our core, we
believe the same things.

954
00:38:58,035 --> 00:38:59,997
Until I think about
telling our children

955
00:39:00,021 --> 00:39:01,932
how unbelievably loved they are

956
00:39:01,956 --> 00:39:03,935
by the Creator of the
universe, who also made them,

957
00:39:03,959 --> 00:39:05,436
and I can just see
you standing there,

958
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:07,994
judging and dismissive,
and I just can't get past it.

959
00:39:08,062 --> 00:39:09,679
Can we please just take a break

960
00:39:09,748 --> 00:39:11,497
from our hypothetical
children for...

961
00:39:11,566 --> 00:39:14,867
No, we can't, because they're
not hypothetical anymore.

962
00:39:17,972 --> 00:39:19,339
Jackson, I'm pregnant.

963
00:39:19,407 --> 00:39:22,041
<i>So, what do you do?</i>

964
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:24,477
<i>How do you decide?</i>

965
00:39:24,546 --> 00:39:26,306
<i>When you're left in the dark?</i>

966
00:39:29,284 --> 00:39:30,783
<i>How do you make sure</i>

967
00:39:30,852 --> 00:39:33,253
<i>you're not making the worst
mistake of someone's life?</i>

968
00:39:33,855 --> 00:39:35,888
So, now what?

969
00:39:35,957 --> 00:39:40,259
We just cross our fingers
and hope he gets better?

970
00:39:40,328 --> 00:39:41,661
Guess so.

971
00:39:43,632 --> 00:39:44,897
Good night, Edwards.

972
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,272
<i>You close your eyes.</i>

973
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:02,098
<i>You block out everyone
and everything around you.</i>

974
00:40:06,471 --> 00:40:07,703
Cristina?

975
00:40:14,179 --> 00:40:15,211
Cristina?

976
00:40:16,347 --> 00:40:17,446
Cristina?

977
00:40:18,116 --> 00:40:19,215
Are you okay?

978
00:40:25,306 --> 00:40:27,640
Cristina, they
were very sick kids.

979
00:40:27,709 --> 00:40:29,375
Every one of them

980
00:40:29,443 --> 00:40:31,421
would have been looking at
a death sentence without you.

981
00:40:31,445 --> 00:40:32,990
The fact that any
of them survived...

982
00:40:33,014 --> 00:40:34,414
I know this, Owen.

983
00:40:34,482 --> 00:40:35,826
Frankie was on borrowed time

984
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:38,918
from the moment she got here.

985
00:40:38,986 --> 00:40:40,964
You made the right decision.
You made the right call.

986
00:40:40,988 --> 00:40:44,941
I know I made the right
call. You don't have to tell me.

987
00:40:45,009 --> 00:40:48,878
It was an impossible
decision, and I stand by it.

988
00:40:53,851 --> 00:40:55,818
I did everything

989
00:40:57,054 --> 00:40:59,922
exactly as I was supposed to.

990
00:41:00,658 --> 00:41:02,725
I did it perfectly.

991
00:41:06,648 --> 00:41:08,280
So what is wrong?

992
00:41:13,988 --> 00:41:16,506
What's the point, Owen?

993
00:41:20,912 --> 00:41:22,912
What's the point of anything?

994
00:41:29,754 --> 00:41:31,420
You won.

995
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:36,125
The Harper Avery.
You got the most votes.

996
00:41:36,193 --> 00:41:37,793
Richard just told me.

997
00:41:39,463 --> 00:41:41,063
The politics screwed you.

998
00:41:41,132 --> 00:41:42,977
The foundation's
relationship with us.

999
00:41:43,001 --> 00:41:44,433
They used you.

1000
00:41:47,138 --> 00:41:49,378
You never stood a chance.

1001
00:41:53,978 --> 00:41:57,079
<i>And pray that the
voice inside you</i>

1002
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:02,285
<i>is right.</i>

1003
00:42:05,774 --> 00:42:07,574
<i>Because once you've decided,</i>

1004
00:42:13,214 --> 00:42:15,214
<i>you can't ever go back.</i>
