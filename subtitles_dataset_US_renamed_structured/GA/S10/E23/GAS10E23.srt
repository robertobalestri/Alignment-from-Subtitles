1
00:00:03,037 --> 00:00:06,872
<i>Every action has an
equal and opposite reaction.</i>

2
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:08,785
<i>Emergency rooms
are kept in business</i>

3
00:00:08,809 --> 00:00:10,954
<i>by people who've learned
that lesson the hard way.</i>

4
00:00:10,978 --> 00:00:14,113
<i>You made waffles in our kitchen.</i>

5
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:15,881
No, not me.

6
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:19,985
Your sister, in between weepy
phone calls with the fiance.

7
00:00:20,054 --> 00:00:22,014
<i>Skydivers, bull riders...</i>

8
00:00:22,056 --> 00:00:24,389
<i>People whose bold
ideas can often result</i>

9
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:26,958
<i>in broken bones and
smushed spleens.</i>

10
00:00:27,028 --> 00:00:29,261
<i>Well, being away
from home is hard.</i>

11
00:00:29,313 --> 00:00:31,223
<i>I've been in DC for so
long. I know how she feels.</i>

12
00:00:31,247 --> 00:00:32,392
You're the one who
brought her here.

13
00:00:32,416 --> 00:00:33,526
She doesn't need your sympathy.

14
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:35,228
She needs you to send her home.

15
00:00:35,252 --> 00:00:36,935
<i>Now, did she say that?</i>

16
00:00:36,987 --> 00:00:39,398
I'm sure she's telling James all
about how we're holding her hostage.

17
00:00:39,422 --> 00:00:41,251
<i>Well, we can negotiate
the terms of her release</i>

18
00:00:41,275 --> 00:00:42,740
<i>when I get home later tonight.</i>

19
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:44,649
Tonight? You and
I have a surgery

20
00:00:44,678 --> 00:00:46,540
scheduled this
afternoon together.

21
00:00:46,564 --> 00:00:48,363
<i>Another meeting popped up.</i>

22
00:00:48,432 --> 00:00:49,964
<i>I'm gonna have Amy cover for me.</i>

23
00:00:50,033 --> 00:00:51,777
<i>Sorry.</i>

24
00:00:51,801 --> 00:00:55,020
No. Not you. The
waffles are amazing.

25
00:00:55,089 --> 00:00:57,605
I'm gonna miss having a hostage.

26
00:00:57,674 --> 00:01:01,126
<i>Surgeons are trained to deal
with the fallout of bold ideas.</i>

27
00:01:01,194 --> 00:01:02,628
<i>We pick up the pieces</i>

28
00:01:02,696 --> 00:01:05,330
<i>and do our best to
fit them back together.</i>

29
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:07,966
Guys, Jo's dying.

30
00:01:08,034 --> 00:01:09,468
They're stress hives.

31
00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:11,114
I've been a mess since I
heard Hunt and Webber

32
00:01:11,138 --> 00:01:12,682
talk about firing one of us.

33
00:01:12,706 --> 00:01:15,240
You're a mess? I've gained
eight pounds this week.

34
00:01:15,309 --> 00:01:16,575
You could stop eating.

35
00:01:16,644 --> 00:01:18,455
Where do you even
get these at 7:00 a.m.?

36
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,178
Drop it before I drop you.

37
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:22,525
You know who's
not getting fired? Me.

38
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:25,150
I'm gonna keep my head
down and stay out of trouble.

39
00:01:25,218 --> 00:01:26,429
No, we should be
impressing them,

40
00:01:26,453 --> 00:01:28,398
showing them they need
us. Wait. I'm confused.

41
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:30,656
Should I keep my head down,
or should I put on a show?

42
00:01:30,724 --> 00:01:33,792
You just need to go one week
without having a nervous breakdown.

43
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:36,072
Why does everything
keep coming back to that?

44
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:37,729
It happened once!

45
00:01:37,798 --> 00:01:39,743
Relax. Hey, I'm the
one who's in trouble.

46
00:01:39,767 --> 00:01:41,478
Last one in, first one out.

47
00:01:41,502 --> 00:01:43,212
Please, even if you
weren't Dr. Bailey's husband,

48
00:01:43,236 --> 00:01:44,536
you're still Webber's favorite.

49
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:46,521
Okay, I need two
of you for rounds.

50
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:48,189
Warren, Murphy, let's go.

51
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:49,475
Nice knowing you.

52
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:57,849
Braden Morris' ALC and
T cell counts are fantastic.

53
00:01:57,918 --> 00:01:59,296
Do you think it
might actually be time

54
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,430
for the boy to come
out of the bubble?

55
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:02,520
It would appear so.

56
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:05,029
So why do you look like
I just punched a kitten?

57
00:02:05,092 --> 00:02:07,459
We can't send him
home until I tell his parents

58
00:02:07,527 --> 00:02:09,294
the truth about
how I treated him.

59
00:02:09,363 --> 00:02:12,965
And before I do that, I
need to inform the board.

60
00:02:13,033 --> 00:02:14,444
Yang. - Mmm?

61
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:17,636
I gave a patient a
stem cell transplant

62
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:20,939
using deactivated
HIV as a viral vector

63
00:02:21,008 --> 00:02:22,368
in order to cure his SCID.

64
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:24,860
I did so against
his parents' wishes.

65
00:02:26,263 --> 00:02:27,379
Whoa!

66
00:02:28,516 --> 00:02:30,115
Did it work?

67
00:02:30,184 --> 00:02:31,424
Damn right, it did.

68
00:02:33,053 --> 00:02:35,353
Up top! Hey!

69
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,568
I've just informed the board.

70
00:02:38,592 --> 00:02:40,792
Now, let's go see his folks.

71
00:02:44,532 --> 00:02:46,532
Look at this cute, little fetus.

72
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,033
I want to send this to my mom.

73
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:49,879
Of course, right after
the first trimester.

74
00:02:49,903 --> 00:02:51,615
Two more weeks.
Come on, that's so far.

75
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:54,117
Look, if we start telling
people, we gotta tell my mom.

76
00:02:54,141 --> 00:02:56,002
She already tried to
torpedo our relationship once

77
00:02:56,026 --> 00:02:57,759
over a hypothetical child.

78
00:02:57,828 --> 00:03:00,139
What do you think she's
gonna do with a real one?

79
00:03:00,163 --> 00:03:01,580
Oh, hey, guys.

80
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:02,848
Hey.

81
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:04,148
Hi! Hey!

82
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:07,552
Just having a checkup
with the old OB-GYN,

83
00:03:07,621 --> 00:03:10,188
making sure all the
parts are in order.

84
00:03:10,257 --> 00:03:11,790
Yeah.

85
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:13,058
Both of you?

86
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:14,393
Callie Torres?

87
00:03:14,461 --> 00:03:15,627
Hi. Yes. That's me.

88
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:17,496
Uh, I think I can
handle this on my own.

89
00:03:17,565 --> 00:03:18,805
Okay.

90
00:03:21,235 --> 00:03:22,545
That was terrible!

91
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:24,886
And what's up with
this? I don't know!

92
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:26,833
Mmm! Hey! The
first candidate's here

93
00:03:26,857 --> 00:03:28,034
and waiting in the
conference room.

94
00:03:28,058 --> 00:03:29,658
I'm on my way now. Okay.

95
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:32,205
So, I still can't believe

96
00:03:32,229 --> 00:03:34,007
he's making you
pick your replacement.

97
00:03:34,031 --> 00:03:36,231
Mmm.

98
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,234
I'm interviewing Dr. Russell's
replacement, not mine.

99
00:03:39,303 --> 00:03:40,847
Which I volunteered
to do, by the way.

100
00:03:40,871 --> 00:03:42,137
It's a punishment.

101
00:03:42,206 --> 00:03:45,573
It's like making you clean
the apartment you're vacating.

102
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:47,386
No, Owen knows this
is the right move for me.

103
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:49,222
He's been nothing but
supportive. Mmm-mmm.

104
00:03:49,246 --> 00:03:51,679
Something's coming. I
can feel it in my bones.

105
00:03:55,936 --> 00:03:58,603
Ew. I hate his face.

106
00:03:58,672 --> 00:04:02,373
Okay, now look me in the eye
and tell me this isn't a punishment.

107
00:04:02,443 --> 00:04:04,643
Thank you for this waffle.

108
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:07,607
All right, Miss Campbell.
I'm just gonna grab you...

109
00:04:07,631 --> 00:04:09,764
Non-adherent gauze, Dr. Kepner.

110
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,211
Do you prefer tape or Coban?

111
00:04:11,235 --> 00:04:12,412
Where did you come from?

112
00:04:12,436 --> 00:04:14,202
Just trying to be
useful, proactive.

113
00:04:14,271 --> 00:04:15,648
Finding needs and filling them.

114
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:17,439
That's my business.

115
00:04:17,508 --> 00:04:20,008
30-year-old male,
motorcycle versus SUV.

116
00:04:20,077 --> 00:04:22,355
Complex scalp lac and
bilateral hip dislocations.

117
00:04:22,379 --> 00:04:24,495
Vitals are stable.

118
00:04:24,564 --> 00:04:26,331
Wilson, you want to be useful?

119
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,111
Yeah. Take him to trauma one.

120
00:04:28,135 --> 00:04:30,330
Start the ABCs, get him off the
board, and get him his trauma X-rays.

121
00:04:30,354 --> 00:04:33,472
And I will join you as soon as I
finish up with Ms. Campbell over there.

122
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,017
Absolutely. Of
course, Dr. Kepner.

123
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:36,786
Thank you for the opportunity.

124
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:38,893
You're welcome!

125
00:04:40,664 --> 00:04:42,575
I don't believe it.

126
00:04:42,599 --> 00:04:43,798
We can take him home?

127
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:45,183
Absolutely.

128
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:46,329
Oh!

129
00:04:46,353 --> 00:04:48,886
This is just wonderful.

130
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,555
Thank you, Dr. Bailey.

131
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:52,424
Thank you so much for hearing us

132
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:54,572
and just letting him
get better on his own.

133
00:04:56,997 --> 00:04:58,262
Mr. Morris.

134
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:02,967
Braden did not get
better on his own.

135
00:05:04,204 --> 00:05:05,720
What do you mean?

136
00:05:05,789 --> 00:05:08,273
I gave him the treatment.

137
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:12,577
They did not react as I
had hoped they would.

138
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:14,457
Legal action never
crossed your mind?

139
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:17,315
I had hoped that they
would see the bigger picture.

140
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:20,497
Dr. Edwards should be excused.

141
00:05:20,521 --> 00:05:21,936
She wasn't involved.

142
00:05:22,005 --> 00:05:24,472
Did she know what you
were doing and fail to report it?

143
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:29,594
She was involved.

144
00:05:30,881 --> 00:05:32,147
Okay, um...

145
00:05:32,215 --> 00:05:33,926
I'm gonna get someone
on the phone from legal,

146
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:36,701
and till I come back,
don't go anywhere.

147
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:39,070
Don't speak to
anyone. Don't move.

148
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:44,476
Okay.

149
00:05:53,953 --> 00:05:56,088
Parents authorized
your treatment

150
00:05:56,156 --> 00:05:58,090
with signed consent. Yes.

151
00:05:58,158 --> 00:06:01,392
Then they told Dr. Edwards
that they changed their mind.

152
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:02,928
Yes.

153
00:06:02,996 --> 00:06:05,864
Dr. Edwards informed
you, Dr. Bailey,

154
00:06:05,933 --> 00:06:07,665
of the parents'
withdrawal of consent.

155
00:06:07,735 --> 00:06:09,328
Yes. Yes.

156
00:06:09,352 --> 00:06:12,187
And then you gave the patient
the stem cell transplant anyway.

157
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:16,925
Have you told anyone
else about this?

158
00:06:16,993 --> 00:06:18,604
I informed Dr. Yang this morning

159
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:20,190
as a representative
of the board.

160
00:06:20,214 --> 00:06:22,013
What did she say?

161
00:06:22,082 --> 00:06:23,322
She gave me a high five.

162
00:06:24,585 --> 00:06:26,117
And did you apologize?

163
00:06:26,186 --> 00:06:27,719
To Dr. Yang?

164
00:06:27,788 --> 00:06:29,187
To the parents.

165
00:06:29,256 --> 00:06:32,624
An apology could go a long
way in circumstances like this.

166
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:35,193
An apology is only effective

167
00:06:35,262 --> 00:06:36,673
when a mistake's been made.

168
00:06:36,697 --> 00:06:39,163
I chose not to
honor their wishes.

169
00:06:39,233 --> 00:06:40,532
It wasn't a mistake.

170
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:47,388
All right, Dr. Ross.

171
00:06:47,457 --> 00:06:49,497
Tell us what's so special
about little Jacob here.

172
00:06:49,559 --> 00:06:51,243
Jacob has an omphalocele.

173
00:06:51,311 --> 00:06:53,745
He was born with his abdominal
organs outside of his body.

174
00:06:53,813 --> 00:06:55,741
We've been managing
him with daily application of

175
00:06:55,765 --> 00:06:58,344
silver-sulfadiazine ointment
as a bridge to delayed closure.

176
00:06:58,368 --> 00:07:01,336
And that's your job. And to keep
an eye on the other tiny humans.

177
00:07:01,405 --> 00:07:03,071
It should be a quiet
and adorable day.

178
00:07:04,808 --> 00:07:06,140
Whoa!

179
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:08,170
Look at you, all grown up.

180
00:07:08,228 --> 00:07:10,172
How's the private
sector? Couldn't be better.

181
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:13,215
I just came by to check
on my inguinal hernia kid.

182
00:07:13,283 --> 00:07:15,650
Oh, great. Well,
don't be a stranger.

183
00:07:15,719 --> 00:07:17,352
Yeah, you too.

184
00:07:17,421 --> 00:07:19,221
Hey, Ross, hold up.

185
00:07:19,289 --> 00:07:20,788
I'm not gonna hit you.

186
00:07:20,858 --> 00:07:23,325
I just want you to check
up on an old patient of mine.

187
00:07:23,393 --> 00:07:25,187
Kevin Platt, short gut kid.

188
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:27,273
Did he get his
STEP procedure yet?

189
00:07:27,297 --> 00:07:29,231
Robbins has it
scheduled for Wednesday.

190
00:07:29,299 --> 00:07:31,599
He's here for TPN till then.

191
00:07:31,685 --> 00:07:33,317
Cool. Got it.

192
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:36,470
That's my tablet.

193
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:39,351
Monica Zarr, 27, in
remission from rectal cancer.

194
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:42,760
Okay.

195
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:45,330
Monica now suffers
from poor sphincter control

196
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:47,210
due to her low
anterior resection.

197
00:07:47,234 --> 00:07:48,962
She's here today
for the implantation

198
00:07:48,986 --> 00:07:50,814
of the permanent
rectal pacemaker.

199
00:07:50,838 --> 00:07:53,872
Gosh, when you say
it, it sounds so sexy.

200
00:07:56,326 --> 00:07:57,925
Sorry.

201
00:07:57,994 --> 00:07:59,271
Honey, there's no
need to apologize.

202
00:07:59,295 --> 00:08:00,962
They're doctors.

203
00:08:01,031 --> 00:08:03,498
Um, Monica, I asked
you to keep records

204
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:05,378
of your movements
after your last surgery.

205
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:07,936
Right. The log log.

206
00:08:08,004 --> 00:08:09,148
Paul, give him the poop diary.

207
00:08:09,172 --> 00:08:10,355
Sure.

208
00:08:10,423 --> 00:08:12,891
Every four hours and 26 minutes.

209
00:08:15,312 --> 00:08:17,990
The sacral nerve
stimulator lead we implanted

210
00:08:18,014 --> 00:08:21,026
should have cut your
frequencies down far below this.

211
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:22,495
I'm sorry. I'm gonna recommend

212
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:24,279
that we not implant the
permanent pacemaker.

213
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:26,854
In fact, I think we
should use the OR time

214
00:08:26,924 --> 00:08:28,067
to remove the lead wire.

215
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:29,708
But I'm pooping way less.

216
00:08:29,776 --> 00:08:32,121
But it's not enough to
consider the device effective.

217
00:08:32,145 --> 00:08:33,956
We should explore
some other options.

218
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,713
Such as?

219
00:08:35,782 --> 00:08:39,278
Antidiarrheals, high-fiber
diet, smaller meals.

220
00:08:39,302 --> 00:08:41,102
I'm a professional dancer.

221
00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:43,771
My diet's pretty much
leaves and twigs already.

222
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:45,923
There has to be something else.

223
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:48,460
Sweetie, we made it
through your cancer.

224
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,888
We'll make it through this.

225
00:08:51,915 --> 00:08:53,743
I am so sorry. I
couldn't help it.

226
00:08:53,767 --> 00:08:56,279
But also, she farted like 80
times, and I did not laugh once.

227
00:08:56,303 --> 00:08:58,703
No, you just belched
to rattle the windows.

228
00:08:58,772 --> 00:09:00,088
And Dr. Warren did neither,

229
00:09:00,157 --> 00:09:02,073
so he's gonna take the
lead on the lap chole.

230
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:03,836
You prep Monica
for surgery. Yes, sir.

231
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:05,860
And take an antacid
before you go back in there.

232
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:14,568
No, you need to
bend the knee first.

233
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:16,015
Did you get those
X-rays, Wilson?

234
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:18,106
Think I'd be in
here if she hadn't?

235
00:09:18,174 --> 00:09:21,075
Well, somebody's
sure a grumpus today.

236
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:23,011
Wilson, fill me in.

237
00:09:23,079 --> 00:09:24,479
Hey, what the hell?

238
00:09:24,547 --> 00:09:27,448
I'll be with you in two shakes
of a lamb's tail, Dr. Torres.

239
00:09:27,517 --> 00:09:29,646
Vitals have been stable.
Trauma lab's done.

240
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:32,448
Primary survey revealed a
large, briskly bleeding scalp lac.

241
00:09:32,472 --> 00:09:34,517
I put a pressure dressing
on for you to assess.

242
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:37,475
CT negative for abdominal
or intracranial hemorrhage,

243
00:09:37,544 --> 00:09:39,422
but did show bilateral
hip dislocations,

244
00:09:39,446 --> 00:09:41,607
one anterior and one posterior,

245
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:44,259
with an acetabular wall fracture,
but both have been reduced.

246
00:09:44,283 --> 00:09:46,445
Wilson, this traction pin's
not gonna place itself. Let's go.

247
00:09:46,469 --> 00:09:47,746
Oh, yes. Sure. Of course.

248
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:49,020
Such a grumpus!

249
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:52,690
Do you see this pin, Kepner?

250
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,959
You call me that nonsense
word one more time,

251
00:09:55,027 --> 00:09:56,307
you won't like where I stick it.

252
00:10:03,053 --> 00:10:05,753
So, you'll access the spine
through the retroperitoneum,

253
00:10:05,821 --> 00:10:08,322
and I will perform the
fusion with bone graft

254
00:10:08,391 --> 00:10:09,757
between L5 and S1.

255
00:10:11,094 --> 00:10:12,371
Do you need to take that?

256
00:10:14,064 --> 00:10:15,530
Nope.

257
00:10:15,599 --> 00:10:18,599
So, Derek usually does the...

258
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:21,246
You can take the
call. It's okay. It's fine.

259
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:22,536
I'm sorry.

260
00:10:22,605 --> 00:10:24,050
Just because Derek
and I are having

261
00:10:24,074 --> 00:10:25,484
a hard time juggling our lives,

262
00:10:25,508 --> 00:10:27,119
that doesn't mean that we
should keep you from yours.

263
00:10:27,143 --> 00:10:28,721
You know what? I
liked you a lot better

264
00:10:28,745 --> 00:10:30,389
when you were the sister-in-law
who didn't give a crap.

265
00:10:30,413 --> 00:10:33,030
Could we just go back to
that? That would be great.

266
00:10:34,267 --> 00:10:36,985
Am I qualified to
run the department?

267
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:38,847
Yikes. You know, not my call.

268
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:41,267
What I do know is that
for some strange reason,

269
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:43,636
since I was a resident,
I keep getting thrown

270
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:47,094
the riskiest, high-profile
cardiothoracic surgeries.

271
00:10:47,163 --> 00:10:48,403
I mean, why me, you know?

272
00:10:48,465 --> 00:10:49,465
Uh-huh.

273
00:10:50,867 --> 00:10:52,967
So, you did your fellowship

274
00:10:53,036 --> 00:10:55,070
in Philadelphia under
Jack Alexander?

275
00:10:55,138 --> 00:10:56,699
Do you know Dr. Alexander?

276
00:10:56,723 --> 00:10:59,824
Such a great guy.
Really, sweet as pie.

277
00:10:59,892 --> 00:11:02,861
Which is why it was
always a little embarrassing

278
00:11:02,929 --> 00:11:05,208
when our chief of surgery
would come to me for consults

279
00:11:05,232 --> 00:11:07,031
instead of Dr. Alexander.

280
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,850
I took it as a compliment,
but still, awkward.

281
00:11:10,553 --> 00:11:11,919
Hmm.

282
00:11:14,891 --> 00:11:16,791
Knock, knock. Who's there?

283
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:18,100
Interrupting jellyfish.

284
00:11:18,128 --> 00:11:19,227
Interrupting...

285
00:11:19,295 --> 00:11:21,579
That's my favorite one!

286
00:11:21,631 --> 00:11:23,164
Hey, Dr. Ross.

287
00:11:23,233 --> 00:11:25,032
Kevin doesn't need
the TPN this afternoon.

288
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:27,085
Dr. Karev said he could
do his surgery today.

289
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:30,271
Oh, that's... But Dr. Robbins...

290
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:34,092
Ross, let me explain short
bowel syndrome to you.

291
00:11:34,144 --> 00:11:37,156
Kevin here is missing a
big chunk of his small bowel,

292
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:39,430
which means he needs
surgery to lengthen it.

293
00:11:39,499 --> 00:11:42,316
The sooner we operate,
the sooner he goes home.

294
00:11:42,385 --> 00:11:44,163
Sound good to you? Yeah.

295
00:11:44,187 --> 00:11:45,932
We just need to transfer
you onto my service.

296
00:11:45,956 --> 00:11:48,396
Dr. Ross will pick up
the paperwork for you.

297
00:11:52,528 --> 00:11:54,546
Hey, I should let
Dr. Robbins know.

298
00:11:54,614 --> 00:11:55,947
He's my patient.

299
00:11:56,016 --> 00:11:58,449
Or he will be, as soon as
they sign the transfer papers.

300
00:11:58,518 --> 00:11:59,734
I don't feel good about this.

301
00:11:59,803 --> 00:12:01,368
You got two choices.

302
00:12:01,437 --> 00:12:03,066
You can feel good about
it and scrub in with me,

303
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:05,000
or you can rat me out to Robbins

304
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:06,969
and I tell her you didn't check
placement of some kid's feeding tube

305
00:12:06,993 --> 00:12:08,887
and he nearly died from
aspiration pneumonia.

306
00:12:08,911 --> 00:12:09,944
But that's not true.

307
00:12:10,012 --> 00:12:11,673
Yeah, but I worked
with her for years.

308
00:12:11,697 --> 00:12:13,242
You went nuts and killed my dad.

309
00:12:13,266 --> 00:12:14,732
Who's she gonna believe?

310
00:12:22,209 --> 00:12:25,409
You've already been the head of
your own department for two years.

311
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,258
You think I look too young.

312
00:12:29,282 --> 00:12:30,827
I finished high school early.

313
00:12:30,851 --> 00:12:32,751
Also med school.

314
00:12:32,819 --> 00:12:34,579
It's pretty annoying, right?

315
00:12:35,155 --> 00:12:36,771
Yeah, it's pretty annoying.

316
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,939
Excuse me. Sorry to interrupt.

317
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:41,676
Can I borrow
Dr. Yang for a moment?

318
00:12:41,744 --> 00:12:42,776
Excuse me.

319
00:12:46,282 --> 00:12:48,549
Hope you saved
the big guns for last.

320
00:12:48,618 --> 00:12:50,618
They're all solid
candidates on paper,

321
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:51,927
but between the humble-bragger

322
00:12:51,954 --> 00:12:53,483
and the girl who rode
in on the big wheel...

323
00:12:53,507 --> 00:12:54,989
Cristina, I need to know

324
00:12:55,058 --> 00:12:57,220
exactly what Bailey
said to you this morning.

325
00:12:57,244 --> 00:12:58,426
About?

326
00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:00,671
Her patient, the
deactivated HIV.

327
00:13:01,464 --> 00:13:02,697
Drawing a blank.

328
00:13:02,766 --> 00:13:03,915
Really?

329
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:05,494
Well, I've been
interviewing all day.

330
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:06,896
I'm surprised I
remember my own name.

331
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,637
You know what? It's
probably for the best.

332
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:12,440
Oh, and... Go
easy on these guys.

333
00:13:12,508 --> 00:13:14,468
You know, they can't all be you.

334
00:13:17,063 --> 00:13:19,580
Dr. Avery, I haven't
held my son in months,

335
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:21,982
and I want him to come
out, but for all we know,

336
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:23,995
she could be making up
numbers to cover her own ass.

337
00:13:24,019 --> 00:13:26,187
Yeah, we can't
trust that it's safe.

338
00:13:26,256 --> 00:13:28,200
I mean, what if we get him
home and something happens?

339
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:30,324
You know what? I
understand your concerns.

340
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:31,871
What I'm saying
is if the labs show...

341
00:13:31,895 --> 00:13:34,095
Are you a parent, Dr. Avery?

342
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:44,622
My wife and I are expecting.

343
00:13:44,691 --> 00:13:46,969
Well, if someone
did this to you,

344
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:49,160
your child, how would you react?

345
00:13:51,681 --> 00:13:54,498
I'll go ahead and run some
new labs for you myself.

346
00:13:59,955 --> 00:14:01,517
All right, that might
be enough weight.

347
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:02,985
All right. Ready for that X-ray?

348
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:04,086
Right away. Whoops!

349
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:05,721
Looks like I need
more irrigation.

350
00:14:05,745 --> 00:14:07,145
Uh, Wilson, can you take over?

351
00:14:07,196 --> 00:14:08,546
Yes, absolutely, Dr. Kepner.

352
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:14,052
"Absolutely, Dr. Kepner."

353
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,415
Who are you? I
thought you had grit.

354
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:18,739
I do! I do have grit!

355
00:14:18,808 --> 00:14:21,087
Okay, well, all I see is some
"yes, ma'am, no ma'am" sissy girl,

356
00:14:21,111 --> 00:14:22,721
and there's no place
in ortho for sissy girls.

357
00:14:22,745 --> 00:14:24,678
Do you hear me?

358
00:14:24,747 --> 00:14:27,147
Check yourself before
you wreck yourself.

359
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:29,784
Sweetie, look.

360
00:14:29,853 --> 00:14:32,587
This says yoga might
help. You love yoga.

361
00:14:32,655 --> 00:14:35,989
Are you crazy? I can't
do downward dog.

362
00:14:36,576 --> 00:14:37,925
In a hot room?

363
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:45,533
A bunch of yoga won't
get me my job back.

364
00:14:45,602 --> 00:14:48,202
You lost your job over this?

365
00:14:48,271 --> 00:14:51,305
They can't fire you over
something you can't control.

366
00:14:51,374 --> 00:14:52,606
After the cancer,

367
00:14:52,676 --> 00:14:55,810
I was supposed to have
my big return to the stage.

368
00:14:55,879 --> 00:14:57,456
I was able to make
it through rehearsals,

369
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,880
running back and
forth to the bathroom,

370
00:14:59,949 --> 00:15:02,333
but then, the first
full run-through,

371
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:03,667
no breaks...

372
00:15:04,321 --> 00:15:05,520
Oh, no.

373
00:15:05,588 --> 00:15:08,606
Blastoff, in the
middle of a pirouette.

374
00:15:08,675 --> 00:15:10,635
The fact that it didn't
happen in front of an audience

375
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:14,278
is the only thing that kept me
from shooting myself in the face.

376
00:15:14,347 --> 00:15:16,030
She's exaggerating.

377
00:15:16,098 --> 00:15:19,217
Paul, it was like
frickin' spin art.

378
00:15:27,294 --> 00:15:28,334
Hey, where's Kevin Platt?

379
00:15:28,395 --> 00:15:30,439
Dr. Karev took
him up to surgery.

380
00:15:30,463 --> 00:15:32,308
Hey, what, are you
poaching patients now?

381
00:15:32,332 --> 00:15:33,476
I didn't poach anything.

382
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,677
You stole my short gut kid.

383
00:15:34,701 --> 00:15:36,245
All right. Up until
a few weeks ago,

384
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:37,601
he was our short gut kid.

385
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,903
Look, his parents know
me. They're fine with this.

386
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:43,090
Consents are signed, and
he's just about prepped.

387
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:44,319
Ross?

388
00:15:44,911 --> 00:15:45,993
Really?

389
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:50,698
The kid's on the operating
table. What do you want me to do?

390
00:15:51,735 --> 00:15:53,967
This was a jerk-ass move, Karev,

391
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:55,276
and you know it.

392
00:15:58,541 --> 00:15:59,840
So, no one's qualified?

393
00:15:59,909 --> 00:16:02,977
No, I mean,
they're all qualified...

394
00:16:03,046 --> 00:16:04,311
But Owen's right.

395
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:07,582
I need to accept that none
of them are gonna be me.

396
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:09,495
That's his plan.
What's his plan?

397
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,836
Owen. Didn't make sense before.

398
00:16:11,904 --> 00:16:14,154
A fellow interviewing
potential department heads,

399
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:16,223
showing you a bunch
of people you won't like

400
00:16:16,292 --> 00:16:18,575
to get you to stay. He
wants to offer you the job.

401
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:21,078
Mer, you're thinking
about this way too hard.

402
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:22,880
You don't offer a
first-year attending

403
00:16:22,949 --> 00:16:25,049
head of cardiothoracic
surgery. It's just not done.

404
00:16:25,118 --> 00:16:27,885
You just got hired to run
an entire research facility.

405
00:16:27,954 --> 00:16:29,454
You're perfect for the job.

406
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,523
Wait, two seconds ago,

407
00:16:32,591 --> 00:16:34,992
I wasn't qualified to
interview the candidates,

408
00:16:35,061 --> 00:16:37,161
and now you're saying
that I'm perfect for the job?

409
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:38,496
Yeah, because you're you.

410
00:16:38,565 --> 00:16:40,365
Okay, I'm lost.

411
00:16:40,433 --> 00:16:43,884
Is Owen the one plotting
to keep me here, or are you?

412
00:16:43,953 --> 00:16:46,186
Now you're the one
thinking about it too hard.

413
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:48,133
She's a dancer.
This isn't just a job.

414
00:16:48,157 --> 00:16:49,590
This is who she is.

415
00:16:49,659 --> 00:16:51,169
And we're just
gonna send her home

416
00:16:51,193 --> 00:16:52,605
farting and pooping
uncontrollably

417
00:16:52,629 --> 00:16:54,829
for the rest of her life? And
we're done with the chili.

418
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:57,982
Webber told you
to take an antacid.

419
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:00,062
I did. I drank half a bottle,
and it didn't do anything,

420
00:17:00,086 --> 00:17:01,831
and then I got all
anxious about that,

421
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:03,466
and the next thing you know,
I'm on the train to pizza town.

422
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:06,501
You know what you need? A
magnetic esophageal sphincter.

423
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:08,337
Bailey put one in
an old lady last week.

424
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:09,877
A ring of little magnets

425
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:11,673
at the end of the esophagus,
just above the stomach.

426
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:14,131
Lets food in, stays
closed so you don't keep...

427
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:16,712
Doing that. Yes. Yes.

428
00:17:16,736 --> 00:17:18,119
Please get that thing.

429
00:17:18,187 --> 00:17:20,470
It's a magnetic sphincter? Yeah.

430
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,840
So, if it closes the opening
for the food on the way in,

431
00:17:23,877 --> 00:17:25,387
wouldn't it work on the way out?

432
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:27,778
What, for our cancer dancer?

433
00:17:27,846 --> 00:17:31,286
It's actually pretty good. Yeah.
You should pitch it to Webber.

434
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:34,152
Hey, Edwards, you've been
working with Bailey, right?

435
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,698
She was supposed
to meet me for lunch,

436
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:37,922
but she hasn't returned any
of my calls. Something up?

437
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:44,040
What the hell's the matter with
you? How could you be so reckless?

438
00:17:44,064 --> 00:17:45,941
How did you... I had
to hear it from Edwards!

439
00:17:45,965 --> 00:17:47,376
I sure as hell didn't
hear it from you!

440
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,732
I couldn't tell you.

441
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:51,202
I didn't want you
to have to lie for me.

442
00:17:51,271 --> 00:17:54,421
Dr. Warren, I'd appreciate
it if you stepped outside.

443
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,289
Look, she is my wife.

444
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:01,912
Okay, um...

445
00:18:01,981 --> 00:18:03,992
The lawyers are meeting now.

446
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:05,861
We're discharging Braden soon,

447
00:18:05,885 --> 00:18:08,630
but it does not look like the
Morrises are going to let this go.

448
00:18:08,654 --> 00:18:10,134
So it looks like a
malpractice suit?

449
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:11,429
Worse.

450
00:18:12,325 --> 00:18:14,275
Assault and battery charges.

451
00:18:23,052 --> 00:18:26,053
Tuck's soccer practice
is gonna be over soon.

452
00:18:26,121 --> 00:18:28,155
I was supposed to
pick him up. Can you?

453
00:18:31,093 --> 00:18:35,012
There's nothing you
can do for me here.

454
00:18:55,518 --> 00:18:56,967
Braden's coming
out of the bubble?

455
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,203
Yeah.

456
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:04,775
I wish I could have seen that.

457
00:19:08,781 --> 00:19:10,080
Suction, please.

458
00:19:12,752 --> 00:19:14,713
You can go, Ross.
I've got it from here.

459
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:16,704
Come on. We're in the
middle of a surgery here.

460
00:19:16,773 --> 00:19:19,923
I know. You stole my patient,
but you can't steal Ross.

461
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:22,037
He works for us.
He's my resource,

462
00:19:22,061 --> 00:19:24,578
and I need him in the NICU
doing what he was told to do.

463
00:19:25,881 --> 00:19:28,201
You need an assist?
You've got one.

464
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:32,946
How can I be of help to you?

465
00:19:34,357 --> 00:19:36,424
Sorry, I'm having
a little bit of trouble

466
00:19:36,492 --> 00:19:38,225
dividing these
branching vessels.

467
00:19:38,294 --> 00:19:41,173
I can retract the iliac vein
medially to help with exposure.

468
00:19:41,197 --> 00:19:42,229
Thanks.

469
00:19:42,298 --> 00:19:44,543
Derek's coming
home tonight. Yup.

470
00:19:44,567 --> 00:19:46,000
Which means you can go home.

471
00:19:47,387 --> 00:19:48,497
I understand.

472
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:50,687
I'm sorry.

473
00:19:50,756 --> 00:19:53,351
You were just trying to be
nice, and I bit your head off.

474
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:57,144
I will be out of your
hair first thing tomorrow.

475
00:19:57,213 --> 00:19:59,479
Oh, that? No. This
is not about that.

476
00:19:59,548 --> 00:20:01,849
I've already forgotten
you said that.

477
00:20:01,918 --> 00:20:05,385
So, this isn't you kicking
me out for being a bitch?

478
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:08,222
No. No, we love having you here,

479
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:10,257
but we don't want to
keep you from your life

480
00:20:10,326 --> 00:20:12,793
any more than we have to, so...

481
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,133
What's so funny?

482
00:20:19,202 --> 00:20:21,302
I'm sorry. It's just...

483
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:24,004
If I had spoken to anyone
at Seaside Wellness

484
00:20:24,073 --> 00:20:25,818
the way I spoke to you,
I would have to have

485
00:20:25,842 --> 00:20:28,526
a conversation for
six hours about it.

486
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:29,927
I love it here.

487
00:20:29,995 --> 00:20:32,107
James and I have
not been fighting

488
00:20:32,131 --> 00:20:33,576
about the fact
that I'm still here.

489
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,567
We have been fighting about
the fact that I never want to leave.

490
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:41,988
So, you want to give
me a bionic butthole?

491
00:20:42,057 --> 00:20:43,457
It's magnetic.

492
00:20:43,526 --> 00:20:45,759
Yeah, it was Dr. Murphy's idea.

493
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:48,762
Well, it's commonly used
as the esophageal sphincter

494
00:20:48,831 --> 00:20:50,831
to reduce reflux
and prevent food

495
00:20:50,899 --> 00:20:52,143
from coming back up the throat,

496
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:54,468
but we think, with
a bit of modification,

497
00:20:54,537 --> 00:20:57,387
that it might work just
as well for your stool.

498
00:20:57,456 --> 00:20:58,968
Have you done this before?

499
00:20:58,992 --> 00:21:01,525
No, but it wouldn't
be the first time

500
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:03,094
a medical device was adapted

501
00:21:03,162 --> 00:21:06,296
to something other
than its original intention.

502
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:09,116
But we're willing to
give it a shot if you are.

503
00:21:09,185 --> 00:21:11,435
What do you think, honey?

504
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:16,273
Yes. Please.

505
00:21:16,342 --> 00:21:17,724
Thank you.

506
00:21:17,793 --> 00:21:19,109
Oh, my God. Thank you.

507
00:21:19,178 --> 00:21:20,639
Paul, you okay?

508
00:21:20,663 --> 00:21:22,963
I am ecstatic. My
heart broke when

509
00:21:23,032 --> 00:21:24,977
Dr. Webber said the
pacemaker wouldn't work,

510
00:21:25,001 --> 00:21:27,834
but now you can
have a normal life.

511
00:21:27,904 --> 00:21:29,514
I mean, you can be comfortable.

512
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:30,871
This can all end here.

513
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:33,673
Baby, I love you so much,

514
00:21:33,742 --> 00:21:35,776
and, I mean, that
cancer was one thing,

515
00:21:35,861 --> 00:21:38,139
but I don't know how much
more of this I could take.

516
00:21:38,163 --> 00:21:39,513
I... The smell...

517
00:21:39,581 --> 00:21:40,881
Okay, yeah.

518
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:43,683
We'll take one magnetic
butthole, please.

519
00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:52,003
Twenty pounds. Let's see
if it's fully reduced this time.

520
00:21:52,027 --> 00:21:53,155
All right, you ready to shoot?

521
00:21:53,179 --> 00:21:54,478
Uh, wait. I'm almost finished.

522
00:21:54,547 --> 00:21:56,125
Okay, well, I need to
make sure that his hip

523
00:21:56,149 --> 00:21:58,193
isn't grinding on broken
bone pieces. Yeah. Hold on...

524
00:21:58,217 --> 00:22:00,162
Just give me a second.
Just put on a lead apron!

525
00:22:00,186 --> 00:22:01,446
Please give me a second! Kepner.

526
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:03,299
Dr. Kepner, put
on the damn apron!

527
00:22:07,143 --> 00:22:09,410
Torres, I can't be in here

528
00:22:09,478 --> 00:22:11,177
while you do the X-ray.

529
00:22:19,372 --> 00:22:20,871
Um...

530
00:22:20,939 --> 00:22:23,339
Wilson, take over
for Dr. Kepner.

531
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,449
God, you're so weird today.

532
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:34,329
I'm sorry. I... Shut it.

533
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,503
Just shut it.

534
00:22:36,572 --> 00:22:40,007
I'm telling you, kid,
this is the place to be.

535
00:22:40,075 --> 00:22:41,108
It's quiet.

536
00:22:41,977 --> 00:22:43,243
The company's great.

537
00:22:45,747 --> 00:22:48,515
You and me, we
got a lot in common.

538
00:22:49,885 --> 00:22:52,836
My intestines are
on the inside, but still,

539
00:22:52,905 --> 00:22:54,905
I know what it's
like to feel exposed.

540
00:22:56,308 --> 00:22:57,608
If we stick together,

541
00:22:58,377 --> 00:22:59,660
I think we'll be okay.

542
00:23:00,496 --> 00:23:01,745
In fact...

543
00:23:03,032 --> 00:23:04,982
What the hell, man! I
thought we were friends!

544
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:06,467
His omphalocele's ruptured!

545
00:23:06,535 --> 00:23:08,068
Get me saline,
sterile dressings,

546
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:09,453
and VICRYL mesh, now!

547
00:23:12,458 --> 00:23:14,157
Reload stapler.

548
00:23:14,227 --> 00:23:16,893
You're not gonna
oversew the staple lines?

549
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:18,429
Staples alone should do it.

550
00:23:18,497 --> 00:23:20,375
You don't want to take the time?

551
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:23,534
I mean, I would, but, you
know, I don't like leaks, so...

552
00:23:23,603 --> 00:23:25,402
This isn't my first
STEP procedure.

553
00:23:25,471 --> 00:23:27,299
Oh, I know. I taught
you how to do your first

554
00:23:27,323 --> 00:23:29,034
STEP procedure, which is why

555
00:23:29,058 --> 00:23:31,403
it blows my mind that you
would try and poach my patient.

556
00:23:31,427 --> 00:23:32,737
Why are you making
such a big deal?

557
00:23:32,761 --> 00:23:34,606
Because it's
freaking rude, Alex,

558
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:36,124
and I don't deserve
to be treated like that.

559
00:23:36,148 --> 00:23:38,548
I taught you better than this.
You're out in the world now...

560
00:23:39,852 --> 00:23:40,962
But what you do reflects on
me, and I do not approve of this,

561
00:23:40,986 --> 00:23:42,236
and neither will Lebackes.

562
00:23:42,304 --> 00:23:44,571
So, what, you're
gonna tattle on me?

563
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,191
Dr. Robbins, you're
needed in NICU. 911.

564
00:23:48,261 --> 00:23:49,804
And I spearheaded a hybrid OR

565
00:23:49,828 --> 00:23:51,740
that offered more flexibility
between non-invasive

566
00:23:51,764 --> 00:23:55,366
and invasive techniques,
gamma cameras, the whole works.

567
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:57,229
I definitely want
to bring that here.

568
00:23:57,253 --> 00:23:59,586
Wow, impressive.

569
00:23:59,655 --> 00:24:01,972
Well, do you have
any questions for me?

570
00:24:02,041 --> 00:24:03,741
One.

571
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:05,687
There's a rumor
that working here

572
00:24:05,711 --> 00:24:08,328
means giving up hope of
ever winning the Harper Avery.

573
00:24:11,267 --> 00:24:13,100
That's...

574
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:16,420
That would make a
difference for you?

575
00:24:16,488 --> 00:24:17,955
Of course it would.

576
00:24:18,024 --> 00:24:19,935
I mean, it's the goal, right?

577
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:22,199
I assume it's why
you're leaving.

578
00:24:26,499 --> 00:24:27,499
No.

579
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:33,387
You'll probably never
win a Harper Avery.

580
00:24:33,455 --> 00:24:36,022
I've known people who
have deserved Harper Averys,

581
00:24:36,091 --> 00:24:37,807
and people who have won them,

582
00:24:37,876 --> 00:24:41,462
and the thing they all have
in common was the work.

583
00:24:43,199 --> 00:24:45,039
They are focused on
the work and the patient,

584
00:24:45,067 --> 00:24:50,270
on making someone better or
someone whole or someone live.

585
00:24:50,339 --> 00:24:52,372
That's their goal.

586
00:24:54,143 --> 00:24:56,676
So... No.

587
00:24:56,745 --> 00:25:00,580
I mean, you, specifically,
will never win a Harper Avery.

588
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:01,986
Not if that's what you're after.

589
00:25:05,271 --> 00:25:06,920
So, that's... You know,

590
00:25:06,989 --> 00:25:09,034
I wouldn't give this place another
thought. You'd be a terrible fit.

591
00:25:09,058 --> 00:25:11,258
Thank you so much
for coming in, though.

592
00:25:13,028 --> 00:25:14,339
I don't know what happened.

593
00:25:14,363 --> 00:25:15,907
It burst, Ross. That's
what happened. Move.

594
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:17,675
Fran, get me a
larger VICRYL mesh.

595
00:25:17,699 --> 00:25:19,177
I need to protect his
organs. Can I do anything?

596
00:25:19,201 --> 00:25:21,301
You can step outside. Go.

597
00:25:25,123 --> 00:25:28,692
We ran the labs twice, and
his immune system values

598
00:25:28,761 --> 00:25:30,027
are within the normal range.

599
00:25:33,966 --> 00:25:35,532
Let's do it.

600
00:25:36,802 --> 00:25:37,901
Okay.

601
00:25:39,572 --> 00:25:40,604
Okay.

602
00:25:41,273 --> 00:25:42,539
Come on.

603
00:25:55,704 --> 00:25:56,704
Oh!

604
00:26:07,666 --> 00:26:08,666
Oh!

605
00:26:09,518 --> 00:26:11,435
Oh, baby!

606
00:26:20,312 --> 00:26:22,179
She went about it the wrong way,

607
00:26:22,248 --> 00:26:24,414
but Bailey's treatment did work.

608
00:26:24,483 --> 00:26:27,295
Are you looking for a
"thank you," Dr. Hunt?

609
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:30,403
She's lucky he's alive, because
we're only gonna take her license.

610
00:26:30,472 --> 00:26:34,208
When we're done, she won't
practice medicine ever again.

611
00:26:34,276 --> 00:26:36,554
And if we'd lost him,

612
00:26:36,578 --> 00:26:39,018
I wouldn't stop until
she was behind bars.

613
00:26:40,065 --> 00:26:42,683
It wasn't Dr. Bailey's fault.

614
00:26:42,751 --> 00:26:46,470
She didn't do anything wrong.
It's my fault he got the treatment.

615
00:26:46,538 --> 00:26:47,538
It's mine.

616
00:26:52,978 --> 00:26:55,490
I forgot to tell her you
wanted to withdraw consent,

617
00:26:55,514 --> 00:26:58,414
so she just went ahead,
and when I told her the truth,

618
00:26:58,483 --> 00:27:01,652
she covered for
me. It was a mistake.

619
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:04,071
You forgot? You just forgot?

620
00:27:04,139 --> 00:27:05,655
Hold on. David, please.

621
00:27:05,724 --> 00:27:08,224
Look, Dr. Edwards is
a resident, a trainee...

622
00:27:08,294 --> 00:27:10,661
And if you want to
yell at someone, then...

623
00:27:10,729 --> 00:27:12,963
In what world does
that make it okay?

624
00:27:13,032 --> 00:27:15,682
My son could have died,
and you're just gonna

625
00:27:15,751 --> 00:27:17,650
stand there and tell me
that it's okay because

626
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:20,220
it would have been
a mistake? David.

627
00:27:20,289 --> 00:27:21,889
Honey. David, come here.

628
00:27:22,991 --> 00:27:24,157
Come here.

629
00:27:24,226 --> 00:27:25,759
Sit down.

630
00:27:26,679 --> 00:27:28,478
David, he's alive,

631
00:27:28,547 --> 00:27:29,946
and he's healthy,

632
00:27:30,015 --> 00:27:31,831
and we can take him home.

633
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:35,185
Maybe we should just go home?

634
00:27:35,253 --> 00:27:37,320
Can we, Dad? Can we go home?

635
00:27:38,557 --> 00:27:39,557
Yeah?

636
00:27:40,392 --> 00:27:41,491
Okay.

637
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,626
Yeah?

638
00:27:45,547 --> 00:27:46,846
Okay.

639
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:48,926
You're gonna want
to position the ring

640
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:54,554
in apposition at the level of
the anorectal junction. Good.

641
00:27:54,623 --> 00:27:55,989
Careful.

642
00:27:56,058 --> 00:27:57,473
Okay, once it's aligned,

643
00:27:57,542 --> 00:28:00,427
we'll use the attached
sutures to tie the ends together.

644
00:28:00,496 --> 00:28:01,906
Like this? No.

645
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:05,182
Now, you need to provide
passive reinforcement to the canal.

646
00:28:06,484 --> 00:28:07,712
That's better.

647
00:28:07,736 --> 00:28:09,948
Now, don't add tension
when you throw your knots.

648
00:28:09,972 --> 00:28:13,106
When it's connected, we will
confirm placement with the fluoro.

649
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:26,220
How far along are you?

650
00:28:28,124 --> 00:28:30,124
Ten weeks, today. Mmm.

651
00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:36,029
I know it's still early.
We're not really

652
00:28:36,098 --> 00:28:38,064
supposed to be
telling anyone, but...

653
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:39,373
Wow.

654
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:42,669
But we're happy about it?

655
00:28:42,755 --> 00:28:44,487
Yeah.

656
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:46,923
Yeah, we are. We're really...

657
00:28:46,992 --> 00:28:48,292
Really happy.

658
00:28:50,946 --> 00:28:53,213
Oh, hey.

659
00:28:53,715 --> 00:28:55,448
Thanks.

660
00:28:56,819 --> 00:28:58,952
Those tears aren't
for me, are they?

661
00:29:01,173 --> 00:29:03,140
There's a reason you
were such a grumpus today?

662
00:29:03,208 --> 00:29:04,674
That is not a word!

663
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:08,545
Sorry. I know. My mom
says it. It sounds so stupid

664
00:29:08,614 --> 00:29:10,581
that once you hear it,
it's hard to stay angry.

665
00:29:10,649 --> 00:29:12,209
Note to self. Does
not work on Callie.

666
00:29:13,719 --> 00:29:16,319
We're trying to
have another baby.

667
00:29:16,388 --> 00:29:18,388
And I had an
appointment this morning,

668
00:29:18,457 --> 00:29:20,117
you know, just to
get the lay of the land.

669
00:29:20,141 --> 00:29:22,237
But I guess since
the car accident,

670
00:29:22,261 --> 00:29:24,272
I've developed all
these adhesions,

671
00:29:24,296 --> 00:29:27,631
and so I can't
carry another baby.

672
00:29:30,069 --> 00:29:32,202
Oh, Callie, I'm so sorry.

673
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:33,414
No, I'm sorry.

674
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:34,738
I'm sorry, too.

675
00:29:34,807 --> 00:29:37,207
Wilson, we need
to put a bell on you.

676
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:40,293
I owe you both an
apology for snapping.

677
00:29:40,362 --> 00:29:43,813
We overheard that one of the
residents isn't coming back next year,

678
00:29:43,882 --> 00:29:47,984
and I've just been so
afraid that it might be me.

679
00:29:48,053 --> 00:29:49,773
Could be. Totally possible.

680
00:29:53,241 --> 00:29:55,692
It's not that James
isn't amazing. He is.

681
00:29:55,761 --> 00:29:58,361
I mean, he really helped
me through something.

682
00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:00,214
But I'm through
it now, you know?

683
00:30:00,282 --> 00:30:02,849
I mean, I'm on the
other side, you know?

684
00:30:02,917 --> 00:30:05,736
And now, when I stop
and look around, I just...

685
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:10,824
I don't think I need him
anymore, which is terrible, right?

686
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:12,070
I don't know.

687
00:30:12,094 --> 00:30:13,772
When we're done here,
I am gonna go and meet

688
00:30:13,796 --> 00:30:16,396
with our patient's family,
and then I'm gonna go home

689
00:30:16,465 --> 00:30:18,265
and bake a cake with
your kids and read them

690
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:20,233
a really long bedtime story.

691
00:30:20,302 --> 00:30:22,135
And then, when I have absolutely

692
00:30:22,203 --> 00:30:24,804
no more ways of
avoiding breaking the heart

693
00:30:24,873 --> 00:30:29,208
of this man who deserves
better, I'm gonna call James,

694
00:30:29,278 --> 00:30:32,045
and I'm gonna tell
him that I love him...

695
00:30:33,716 --> 00:30:35,415
But I can't do this anymore.

696
00:30:41,273 --> 00:30:42,572
She's lying!

697
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,840
Bailey, that is enough.

698
00:30:43,909 --> 00:30:45,349
I understand you
wanting to protect

699
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:46,776
our residents,
but you should not

700
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:47,894
have let it go this far.

701
00:30:47,963 --> 00:30:49,563
Well, you're taking
her word over mine!

702
00:30:49,631 --> 00:30:51,181
It is over, Bailey.

703
00:30:51,249 --> 00:30:52,649
The Morrises have agreed

704
00:30:52,718 --> 00:30:54,450
to drop the charges in exchange

705
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:56,352
for Edwards receiving one week's

706
00:30:56,421 --> 00:30:59,038
disciplinary suspension.

707
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:00,557
They have gone home.

708
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:02,192
You should both do the same.

709
00:31:07,716 --> 00:31:09,777
What the hell is wrong with you?

710
00:31:09,801 --> 00:31:13,170
If you got fired over
this, no one would benefit

711
00:31:13,239 --> 00:31:15,805
from this treatment
the way Braden did.

712
00:31:15,875 --> 00:31:18,342
You were gonna go
down for this, Dr. Bailey.

713
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:21,511
You knew it could happen, but
you were willing to risk everything

714
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:23,330
to save that little boy.

715
00:31:23,398 --> 00:31:24,659
What kind of surgeon would I be

716
00:31:24,683 --> 00:31:26,249
if I wasn't willing
to do the same?

717
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:30,481
Plus, there's a chance I
won't even be here next year,

718
00:31:30,505 --> 00:31:32,038
so I was just rolling the dice.

719
00:31:33,408 --> 00:31:35,775
I was looking at
the bigger picture.

720
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:44,050
You're not going anywhere
without a fight from me.

721
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:51,702
If it's all right with you, sir,

722
00:31:51,726 --> 00:31:53,660
I'd like to stay
on Monica's case.

723
00:31:53,728 --> 00:31:56,229
I want to be there when she
comes back for a follow-up.

724
00:31:57,282 --> 00:31:59,382
Come over here.

725
00:31:59,451 --> 00:32:01,951
Let's, um... Let's have a seat.

726
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:13,112
That was a good
move today, Murphy.

727
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:15,315
You're very bright, and you have

728
00:32:15,384 --> 00:32:17,850
what it takes to be
a very good doctor.

729
00:32:20,088 --> 00:32:21,505
But you're not a surgeon.

730
00:32:24,225 --> 00:32:25,659
What?

731
00:32:25,727 --> 00:32:29,095
Standing next to you in
surgery today only confirmed it.

732
00:32:29,814 --> 00:32:31,014
You make five moves

733
00:32:31,082 --> 00:32:33,483
where a second-year
resident should make two.

734
00:32:33,552 --> 00:32:37,421
Your knots aren't square. You
can't see the planes of dissection.

735
00:32:37,489 --> 00:32:39,722
Next year, you'd
only fall farther behind.

736
00:32:40,359 --> 00:32:42,525
I can work harder.

737
00:32:42,594 --> 00:32:43,994
I can do better.

738
00:32:44,062 --> 00:32:47,530
A surgical residency just
isn't the right fit for you.

739
00:32:49,184 --> 00:32:50,517
Is...

740
00:32:50,585 --> 00:32:52,814
Is this because I filed
that harassment complaint?

741
00:32:52,838 --> 00:32:54,771
No, Murphy. No.

742
00:32:56,675 --> 00:32:58,608
Letting you go
isn't a punishment.

743
00:32:59,277 --> 00:33:00,377
It's a kindness.

744
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:03,246
And you deserve
every opportunity

745
00:33:03,315 --> 00:33:05,715
to figure out what your
next steps might be.

746
00:33:05,784 --> 00:33:07,917
In the meantime, Dr. Miller

747
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:09,897
at the University of
Washington runs a research lab,

748
00:33:09,921 --> 00:33:11,788
and I think you would
do very well there.

749
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:15,325
She owes me a favor.

750
00:33:15,394 --> 00:33:17,694
I'd be more than happy
to make a phone call.

751
00:33:21,567 --> 00:33:23,848
Thank you, sir.

752
00:33:42,688 --> 00:33:44,432
So, observe him
carefully overnight,

753
00:33:44,456 --> 00:33:46,600
and in a few weeks, we'll do
a double-thickness skin graft.

754
00:33:46,624 --> 00:33:47,624
Okay.

755
00:33:54,733 --> 00:33:56,944
What, did you come
to steal more babies?

756
00:33:56,968 --> 00:33:58,285
Don't tell Lebackes.

757
00:34:00,305 --> 00:34:02,973
Oh, God. That makes it worse.

758
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:05,542
Get out. Look, I'm
sorry. I screwed up.

759
00:34:06,645 --> 00:34:08,311
Kind of...

760
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:10,647
I'm drowning over there.

761
00:34:10,716 --> 00:34:13,983
Here, cases come in all
the time. I can prove myself.

762
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:15,630
Over there, if you're
not bringing in the cases,

763
00:34:15,654 --> 00:34:18,321
you're not bringing in the
money, and you're a nobody.

764
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:20,870
I don't want to lose this gig.
I didn't know what else to do.

765
00:34:27,232 --> 00:34:29,672
I'm in trouble, and I need help.

766
00:34:29,751 --> 00:34:30,851
What do you mean?

767
00:34:30,919 --> 00:34:32,864
When something
like this happens,

768
00:34:32,888 --> 00:34:36,406
you call me, and you say, "Arizona,
I'm in trouble, and I need help."

769
00:34:36,942 --> 00:34:38,182
And I help you.

770
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:40,560
Do you understand? Right.

771
00:34:47,436 --> 00:34:49,903
I couldn't tell
you. So you said.

772
00:34:54,726 --> 00:34:56,793
I need to know.

773
00:34:56,861 --> 00:35:00,397
This risk, was it
absolutely necessary?

774
00:35:00,466 --> 00:35:01,706
He was dying.

775
00:35:02,868 --> 00:35:06,536
And I created
something out of thin air.

776
00:35:06,605 --> 00:35:11,257
I took a virus that kills
into something that heals,

777
00:35:12,126 --> 00:35:13,793
and I saved his life.

778
00:35:16,831 --> 00:35:19,332
I saved his life.

779
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:36,315
You know, I've thought about it,

780
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:39,418
and if you want to send
the ultrasound to your mom,

781
00:35:39,487 --> 00:35:41,121
that wouldn't be
the worst thing.

782
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:43,256
You've told!

783
00:35:43,324 --> 00:35:44,657
I kind of...

784
00:35:44,726 --> 00:35:45,966
Who did you tell?

785
00:35:47,129 --> 00:35:48,161
Stephanie?

786
00:35:49,765 --> 00:35:51,542
Oh, wow! So, after all the
crap you gave me this morning,

787
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:53,577
you went and told
your ex-girlfriend?

788
00:35:53,601 --> 00:35:56,121
It was an accident,
okay? I'm sorry. Uh-huh.

789
00:35:58,706 --> 00:36:00,273
I forgive you.

790
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:03,576
Thanks. Mmm-hmm.

791
00:36:03,645 --> 00:36:05,779
Still don't know how
we're gonna tell my mom.

792
00:36:05,847 --> 00:36:09,015
What do you mean, "we"?
That is all you, Talky Tina.

793
00:36:14,372 --> 00:36:15,805
How are your hives?

794
00:36:15,874 --> 00:36:18,341
Oh, my back looks
like a political map

795
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:21,111
of the United States, big
mess of red down the middle,

796
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:22,912
plus Alaska. Bad day?

797
00:36:22,981 --> 00:36:24,196
Bad day.

798
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:26,265
Did you pop a baby?
I popped a baby.

799
00:36:26,334 --> 00:36:29,986
I don't even know what that
could mean. And do not elaborate.

800
00:36:30,054 --> 00:36:32,015
You guys are gonna be fine.

801
00:36:32,039 --> 00:36:33,806
That's easy for you to say.

802
00:36:33,875 --> 00:36:36,242
Your big victory in
the OR. You're fine.

803
00:36:36,311 --> 00:36:38,110
One of us is
definitely going down.

804
00:36:38,179 --> 00:36:40,259
Come on, let's
go drink about it.

805
00:36:43,819 --> 00:36:45,819
You really think
I'm gonna be okay?

806
00:36:47,739 --> 00:36:49,038
I really do.

807
00:36:52,794 --> 00:36:54,914
Go, go, go. I'll meet you there.

808
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,046
Well, I...

809
00:37:13,114 --> 00:37:15,214
I could do it. No.

810
00:37:15,283 --> 00:37:16,916
I could.

811
00:37:16,985 --> 00:37:18,517
I could carry the baby.

812
00:37:19,788 --> 00:37:20,820
I won't ask you to.

813
00:37:20,889 --> 00:37:22,288
But I'm offering.

814
00:37:23,925 --> 00:37:25,324
Because we want this.

815
00:37:25,393 --> 00:37:26,893
I want this.

816
00:37:26,961 --> 00:37:28,121
And I can do it.

817
00:37:30,699 --> 00:37:32,331
We just got good again.

818
00:37:35,269 --> 00:37:37,336
Now we're too fragile.

819
00:37:37,405 --> 00:37:40,206
And something like this, if it
goes badly, we won't make it.

820
00:37:40,274 --> 00:37:42,124
I'm not gonna put
us in that position.

821
00:37:46,965 --> 00:37:48,165
Okay.

822
00:37:52,688 --> 00:37:54,120
We have a beautiful life.

823
00:37:55,724 --> 00:37:57,290
We have a beautiful daughter.

824
00:37:59,661 --> 00:38:01,294
And that can be enough, right?

825
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:03,495
Yes.

826
00:38:06,101 --> 00:38:07,499
That can be enough.

827
00:38:13,125 --> 00:38:15,325
I love you, Calliope.

828
00:38:15,911 --> 00:38:17,743
I love you, too.

829
00:38:31,259 --> 00:38:33,538
Hey. How'd it go? Do we
have a new head of cardio?

830
00:38:33,562 --> 00:38:35,628
I don't know.

831
00:38:35,697 --> 00:38:37,808
I did screen all these applicants
before they came to you.

832
00:38:37,832 --> 00:38:39,009
They couldn't have
been all that bad.

833
00:38:39,033 --> 00:38:41,767
No, they're mostly
fine. No, not fine. Good.

834
00:38:41,836 --> 00:38:43,769
Any one of them
could do the job.

835
00:38:45,073 --> 00:38:46,739
Except humble-bragger.

836
00:38:49,711 --> 00:38:51,811
What?

837
00:38:51,879 --> 00:38:53,458
The Harper Avery Foundation's

838
00:38:53,482 --> 00:38:57,217
been looking for ways
to mend fences with us

839
00:38:57,285 --> 00:38:59,285
after what happened to you.

840
00:39:01,139 --> 00:39:04,574
A large cash infusion
into our cardio department

841
00:39:04,643 --> 00:39:07,944
could allow us to attract
higher caliber of talent,

842
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:09,573
and then... Owen, don't.

843
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:10,941
The worst they can do is say no.

844
00:39:10,965 --> 00:39:13,032
Please don't offer me this job.

845
00:39:13,101 --> 00:39:14,199
I...

846
00:39:19,874 --> 00:39:20,994
I wanted to.

847
00:39:23,545 --> 00:39:24,994
For a week.

848
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:31,250
But I know you have to go.

849
00:39:33,989 --> 00:39:36,155
And I know nothing good

850
00:39:36,224 --> 00:39:38,725
can come of me
asking you to stay.

851
00:39:41,913 --> 00:39:43,279
So I'm not.

852
00:39:48,537 --> 00:39:49,735
And I won't.

853
00:39:53,341 --> 00:39:54,373
Thank you.

854
00:40:02,634 --> 00:40:04,915
But I will ask you
something else.

855
00:40:05,771 --> 00:40:06,919
What?

856
00:40:14,813 --> 00:40:17,781
Owen... Just until you go.

857
00:40:17,849 --> 00:40:20,216
Don't leave me until
you're leaving me.

858
00:40:21,987 --> 00:40:23,285
Just until you go.

859
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:48,478
Hey, stranger! Hey!

860
00:40:48,547 --> 00:40:49,787
What are you drinking?

861
00:40:49,848 --> 00:40:53,750
You know what? Doesn't
matter. You can dump it out.

862
00:40:53,819 --> 00:40:55,067
This is better.

863
00:40:58,223 --> 00:41:00,790
Champagne is perfect, because...

864
00:41:00,859 --> 00:41:03,179
I was wrong about
the Amelia situation.

865
00:41:03,211 --> 00:41:05,712
She doesn't want to
leave. She wants to stay.

866
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:07,224
She can take over your service.

867
00:41:07,248 --> 00:41:08,659
She can help out with the kids.

868
00:41:08,683 --> 00:41:10,861
You can brain map
to your heart's content.

869
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:13,097
I don't have to
pull my hair out.

870
00:41:13,121 --> 00:41:15,337
It is the answer
we've been looking for.

871
00:41:15,406 --> 00:41:17,018
This is great! It is, right?

872
00:41:17,042 --> 00:41:19,709
Yeah. Amy can move to
Seattle, and we can move to DC.

873
00:41:21,913 --> 00:41:23,996
That wasn't the
point of my story.

874
00:41:24,065 --> 00:41:25,231
I met him, Meredith.

875
00:41:26,568 --> 00:41:27,568
I met the president.

876
00:41:28,169 --> 00:41:30,203
He came to us.

877
00:41:30,271 --> 00:41:33,005
We walked him through
everything we've been working on.

878
00:41:33,074 --> 00:41:34,490
And then, at the end of it,

879
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:36,604
he said that he wanted to
make this a weekly thing.

880
00:41:36,628 --> 00:41:39,529
They offered me a
position at the NIH.

881
00:41:39,597 --> 00:41:41,280
It's the job. I'll
be right there,

882
00:41:41,348 --> 00:41:42,999
on the ground, doing the actual

883
00:41:43,067 --> 00:41:46,569
brain-mapping work myself.
They've given me everything.

884
00:41:48,206 --> 00:41:49,605
Well, we can't just

885
00:41:49,674 --> 00:41:51,452
pack up and move
across the country.

886
00:41:51,476 --> 00:41:53,020
They have promised to
have an attending position

887
00:41:53,044 --> 00:41:54,755
waiting for you at
James Madison hospital.

888
00:41:54,779 --> 00:41:56,946
<i>The thing about
the bold moves...</i>

889
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:58,414
<i>They're terrifying.</i>

890
00:41:58,483 --> 00:42:00,728
<i>Could end in nothing but
tears and broken bones.</i>

891
00:42:00,752 --> 00:42:03,869
If Amy wants to move to Seattle,
she can take over my practice

892
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:06,172
without me hovering over
her, and she will thrive.

893
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,907
Alex is leaving,
Cristina's moving on.

894
00:42:07,975 --> 00:42:09,442
They all have their next step.

895
00:42:09,511 --> 00:42:10,810
This could be our next step.

896
00:42:12,814 --> 00:42:14,046
This should be our next step.

897
00:42:14,115 --> 00:42:17,566
<i>And that's exactly what
makes them so damned exciting.</i>
