1
00:00:07,941 --> 00:00:10,942
<i>Every doctor has
a dirty little secret.</i>

2
00:00:11,012 --> 00:00:13,912
<i>We're all competitive
science nerds.</i>

3
00:00:13,981 --> 00:00:16,793
<i>In grade school, we made the
biggest and the best volcanoes,</i>

4
00:00:16,817 --> 00:00:19,117
<i>which erupted actual
fake molten lava.</i>

5
00:00:21,288 --> 00:00:25,924
<i>In junior high, we spent hours
laboring over our rat mazes.</i>

6
00:00:25,993 --> 00:00:28,438
The computer diagnostic is
complete. Everything checks out.

7
00:00:28,462 --> 00:00:30,006
Finished the robotic
prosthetic inspection.

8
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,196
It's all in order.

9
00:00:31,265 --> 00:00:33,665
So, we're ready to try again?

10
00:00:34,602 --> 00:00:36,282
Let's get her connected. Okay.

11
00:00:37,237 --> 00:00:39,198
Okay. Every time you do that,

12
00:00:39,222 --> 00:00:41,101
I feel like <i>The Bride
of Frankenstein.</i>

13
00:00:41,125 --> 00:00:42,457
<i>So that one day</i>

14
00:00:42,526 --> 00:00:46,662
<i>we'd be the person who changed
the face of medicine forever.</i>

15
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:48,174
This is so exciting.

16
00:00:48,198 --> 00:00:51,232
Your first printed portal vein
is going into a test subject.

17
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:52,467
How do you feel?

18
00:00:52,536 --> 00:00:54,936
Like a farmhand
behind the back barn.

19
00:00:55,005 --> 00:00:57,325
Here. Why don't you
take over the clippers?

20
00:00:58,492 --> 00:00:59,792
Look at us.

21
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:02,561
Changing the face of
medicine, shearing a sheep.

22
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:04,274
No, I was shearing a sheep.

23
00:01:04,298 --> 00:01:06,849
You are just giving him a fade.

24
00:01:06,917 --> 00:01:08,494
There you go. There
you go. Look at us.

25
00:01:08,518 --> 00:01:10,686
We're changing
the face of medicine.

26
00:01:14,091 --> 00:01:15,568
Oh!

27
00:01:15,592 --> 00:01:17,209
Wow. That was...

28
00:01:17,277 --> 00:01:19,310
You really know
what you're doing.

29
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:20,619
Are you grading me?

30
00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:23,610
Maybe I am, a little. Mmm.

31
00:01:23,634 --> 00:01:25,594
You're gettin' an
A. I don't know.

32
00:01:25,652 --> 00:01:27,079
I'm kind of an overachiever.

33
00:01:27,103 --> 00:01:28,415
I'd like to go for the A-plus.

34
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:31,840
No. We have a ton to do
before the procedure today.

35
00:01:31,909 --> 00:01:33,675
Okay.

36
00:01:33,744 --> 00:01:37,579
The conduit's coming off the
printer in two hours 47 minutes,

37
00:01:37,647 --> 00:01:41,949
which gives us another 30
minutes before we have to start prep.

38
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:44,352
All right.

39
00:01:44,421 --> 00:01:45,720
Maybe a little extra credit?

40
00:01:45,789 --> 00:01:47,488
Ahh.

41
00:01:47,557 --> 00:01:48,957
How's your research going?

42
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:50,804
Oh, the diagnostics look
good. I just slipped out for a sec.

43
00:01:50,828 --> 00:01:52,338
I don't want to miss this. Mmm.

44
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:54,207
Do you think you're gonna
make it to the shower?

45
00:01:54,231 --> 00:01:56,131
Oh, crap. Kepner's
shower is today?

46
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,643
Yeah, it's today.

47
00:01:57,667 --> 00:01:59,278
And she's our friend, so...
I know she's our friend.

48
00:01:59,302 --> 00:02:00,546
You don't have to tell
me she's our friend.

49
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:02,515
Sorry. I just... I'll
be there if I can.

50
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:04,072
Great. Great.

51
00:02:04,141 --> 00:02:05,373
Dr. Robbins. Dr. Torres.

52
00:02:05,442 --> 00:02:06,720
Dr. Murphy. Dr. Murphy.

53
00:02:08,011 --> 00:02:10,223
That was good.
Professional. I bought it.

54
00:02:10,247 --> 00:02:11,696
Mmm-hmm.

55
00:02:11,765 --> 00:02:13,415
You're dying inside, aren't you?

56
00:02:13,483 --> 00:02:14,728
There's still two
seats left in the gallery.

57
00:02:14,752 --> 00:02:15,829
Who wants them? I do.

58
00:02:15,853 --> 00:02:17,664
Whoa. Hey, wait.
What about my surgery?

59
00:02:17,688 --> 00:02:19,432
There's plenty of room.
It's just me and Dr. Grey,

60
00:02:19,456 --> 00:02:21,640
an anesthesiologist
and a veterinarian.

61
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:22,852
You lost me at "Veterinarian."

62
00:02:22,876 --> 00:02:25,344
He's putting a seeded
conduit into a baby.

63
00:02:25,412 --> 00:02:27,745
Who is human. You
are bothering a sheep.

64
00:02:27,798 --> 00:02:29,982
Plus, I'm allergic to wool.

65
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:31,695
I'm allergic to boring surgeries.
- Wow!

66
00:02:33,521 --> 00:02:35,920
Hey. Big day. It is.

67
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,088
You gonna watch?

68
00:02:37,724 --> 00:02:39,057
Watch?

69
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:40,775
Cristina's surgery.

70
00:02:40,844 --> 00:02:42,438
I have my own. Oh, yeah.

71
00:02:42,462 --> 00:02:43,907
The, uh, the pig. Sheep.

72
00:02:43,931 --> 00:02:45,730
The sheep. Yes.

73
00:02:45,783 --> 00:02:47,315
Hey. Uh, here he comes.

74
00:02:53,724 --> 00:02:55,118
What are all of you doing here?

75
00:02:55,142 --> 00:02:56,791
We came to see you off.

76
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:58,638
We couldn't let you leave
without saying good-bye.

77
00:02:58,662 --> 00:02:59,761
We'll miss you.

78
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:00,941
I'm just going home.

79
00:03:00,965 --> 00:03:02,175
I'm not retiring.

80
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:05,000
But first, I just need a
vacation from all of you.

81
00:03:09,473 --> 00:03:13,374
You did it, sir. You
got yourself better.

82
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:15,978
No. You did it, Bailey.

83
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:18,714
You got me better.

84
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:31,175
Is Dr. Webber leaving
very stressful for you?

85
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:34,096
No.

86
00:03:34,164 --> 00:03:36,142
Then why are you
counting your fingers?

87
00:03:42,623 --> 00:03:45,340
Here's to our little Duckie
finally getting married.

88
00:03:45,408 --> 00:03:47,528
To Duckie and Matthew!

89
00:03:48,445 --> 00:03:50,245
"Duckie"? Don't ask.

90
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,414
Mmm. We thought for sure you
were gonna be a spinster for life.

91
00:03:53,484 --> 00:03:55,884
Maybe take it a little easy
on the mimosas, Kimmie.

92
00:03:55,952 --> 00:03:57,885
Oh, leave her be.
She's celebrating.

93
00:03:57,954 --> 00:04:00,772
You two could stand to add
a little champagne to that OJ.

94
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,951
We're on call. Ohh.

95
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:04,709
He is such a dreamboat.

96
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:07,663
Responsible, handsome.

97
00:04:07,731 --> 00:04:10,032
Duckie, I hope you
know how lucky you are.

98
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:15,220
Speaking of dreamboats, who is
that and why is he waving at us?

99
00:04:18,442 --> 00:04:20,052
Hey, guys. Hey, Avery.

100
00:04:20,076 --> 00:04:22,493
Jackson, these are my
sisters, Libby, Kimmie and Alice.

101
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:24,779
O-M-gosh!

102
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:26,568
You're Jackson. The Jackson?

103
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:28,661
Look at that. I
gotta go to work.

104
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:30,880
Yeah. It was nice
to meet you guys.

105
00:04:30,904 --> 00:04:33,165
Oh, wait. You'll be done in
time for mani-pedis, right?

106
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:35,824
I will try. Can you take
them back to my apartment?

107
00:04:35,893 --> 00:04:37,409
Roger that. Oh, no way!

108
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:38,954
We wanna go with you. You
won't even know we're there.

109
00:04:38,978 --> 00:04:41,373
We can see the room for the
shower tomorrow, plan decorations.

110
00:04:41,397 --> 00:04:43,582
Whoo! Field trip.

111
00:04:43,651 --> 00:04:44,916
Come on, Duckie.

112
00:04:46,553 --> 00:04:48,537
Bye, boys.

113
00:04:48,605 --> 00:04:50,372
Gosh, those eyes.

114
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,680
You know, I totally get why
you'd name a pig after him.

115
00:04:58,181 --> 00:04:59,747
Hey. Someone paged me?

116
00:04:59,816 --> 00:05:02,097
That man over
there requested you.

117
00:05:03,237 --> 00:05:04,936
Hey, hon.

118
00:05:05,005 --> 00:05:06,104
What are you doing here?

119
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:08,835
I think I'm gonna puke.

120
00:05:08,859 --> 00:05:11,219
You have to go.
Are you high? No.

121
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:14,012
I'm... I'm trying to get clean.

122
00:05:14,081 --> 00:05:15,797
That's great, but
you can't do it here.

123
00:05:17,034 --> 00:05:18,266
You said...

124
00:05:18,335 --> 00:05:19,913
When I was here,
you said you'd help me.

125
00:05:19,937 --> 00:05:22,738
Yeah, I tried to, Jimmy,
but you refused my help,

126
00:05:22,806 --> 00:05:23,846
and that ship has sailed.

127
00:05:23,873 --> 00:05:26,308
Now I can get some
names for you...

128
00:05:26,376 --> 00:05:28,616
Damn it! I need some help here!

129
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:34,744
All right, well,
I'll see you later.

130
00:05:34,768 --> 00:05:36,008
Yes, indeedy.

131
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:38,302
Oh, you, uh...

132
00:05:38,372 --> 00:05:40,616
I... Yeah, parked over... Right.

133
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,440
There.

134
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:44,709
I did, too. So we can
just... We can just walk.

135
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:46,478
Yeah.

136
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:51,410
You not gonna drink that?

137
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:53,713
Yeah, I try to hold off so I
don't drink it all before work.

138
00:05:53,737 --> 00:05:56,199
Oh, yeah. That's...
That's a good plan.

139
00:05:56,223 --> 00:05:57,555
Hey!

140
00:05:57,624 --> 00:05:59,635
Hey! This is my cab!
Take a walk, hippie.

141
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:01,075
What? Not cool, man.

142
00:06:01,144 --> 00:06:03,425
Aren't you people supposed
to love bikes or something?

143
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,030
Hey, open the door.

144
00:06:05,082 --> 00:06:06,692
People are freaking
animals. Right?

145
00:06:06,716 --> 00:06:07,910
Hey, my tie.

146
00:06:07,934 --> 00:06:09,128
Open the door. Go!

147
00:06:09,152 --> 00:06:10,969
Whoa!

148
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:12,437
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey!

149
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:21,957
Is he breathing?
All right, I'm a doctor.

150
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:24,260
I need all of you to step
back, please. Step back.

151
00:06:24,284 --> 00:06:25,595
Make room. MAN: I don't know.

152
00:06:25,619 --> 00:06:26,984
He's not moving.

153
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:28,403
He's not breathing.

154
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:29,682
911 said a rig's 10 minutes out,

155
00:06:29,706 --> 00:06:31,317
but we gotta get an airway now.

156
00:06:31,341 --> 00:06:32,785
I swear I didn't see it happen.
It was an accident, all right?

157
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:34,404
Step back. Back, sir.
Oh, God! Is he breathing?

158
00:06:34,428 --> 00:06:35,989
I need you to back up!
Back up! Okay! Okay!

159
00:06:36,013 --> 00:06:37,273
I need you to back
up, please. All right.

160
00:06:37,297 --> 00:06:39,331
Seriously, stand
back. Thank you.

161
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:42,149
Back up. Back up. I'm
not kidding. Back up.

162
00:06:42,218 --> 00:06:43,938
Back it up. WOMAN:
He's not breathing.

163
00:06:45,422 --> 00:06:47,271
Whoa! Jeez! CROWD: Ohh!

164
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:48,717
Whoa! What the
hell are you doing?

165
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:50,191
Good chest rise.

166
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:52,855
I hope he knows what he's
doing. I think he's breathing.

167
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:54,178
Guys, just move back.

168
00:06:56,066 --> 00:06:57,777
The cameras are only recording

169
00:06:57,801 --> 00:06:59,478
the doctors and
the surgical field.

170
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:02,237
Your son's identity will
be completely protected.

171
00:07:02,305 --> 00:07:04,467
Good morning. Big day.

172
00:07:04,491 --> 00:07:06,611
We're just hearing
about the cameras.

173
00:07:07,443 --> 00:07:09,093
Sorry? We just told the Glaziers

174
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:11,040
we have a lot of people
who'd like to observe,

175
00:07:11,064 --> 00:07:12,831
so we've set up a live stream.

176
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,999
Okay, but I think
we would feel better

177
00:07:15,052 --> 00:07:17,830
if we knew the focus was on
our baby, not putting on a show.

178
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:20,432
The cameras are
there so that, in success,

179
00:07:20,456 --> 00:07:22,368
other doctors can
learn this technique

180
00:07:22,392 --> 00:07:24,253
to help other kids like Nathan.

181
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:28,546
No. No, that doesn't
work for me. He's a baby.

182
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:30,093
He's a baby. Ashley.

183
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:32,200
Ashley, look at me.

184
00:07:32,268 --> 00:07:34,246
I will be performing
the operation,

185
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:36,182
and my only focus
will be your son.

186
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:39,007
That is all I care
about, okay? That's it.

187
00:07:46,717 --> 00:07:48,717
You spring this on
me the day of surgery?

188
00:07:48,785 --> 00:07:50,585
What? This circus?

189
00:07:50,988 --> 00:07:52,649
Ross said that
this came from you.

190
00:07:52,673 --> 00:07:55,257
Everyone in the hospital's been
asking to watch the procedure.

191
00:07:55,325 --> 00:07:57,536
I got e-mails from UCLA and
Baylor. They wanted a stream.

192
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,971
And I felt none of that
should be on your plate,

193
00:07:58,995 --> 00:08:00,323
so I made some
executive decisions.

194
00:08:00,347 --> 00:08:01,824
I'm happy to have
you veto any of them.

195
00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:03,048
Yeah, like all of 'em.

196
00:08:03,116 --> 00:08:04,593
If that's what Dr. Yang
wants, consider it done.

197
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:06,718
Ross, hang on.

198
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:07,931
This is a teaching hospital.

199
00:08:07,955 --> 00:08:09,165
We need to create conditions

200
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:11,434
where more people can
learn from what you're doing.

201
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:14,192
Live streaming? What if
something goes wrong?

202
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,627
Even if something goes wrong,

203
00:08:16,697 --> 00:08:17,996
you're doing important work,

204
00:08:18,065 --> 00:08:20,145
and people should see that.

205
00:08:20,183 --> 00:08:21,611
I need to take this.

206
00:08:21,635 --> 00:08:22,778
Cristina?

207
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:27,104
Fine.

208
00:08:31,478 --> 00:08:34,512
Okay, now we're
gonna start small today.

209
00:08:34,581 --> 00:08:35,846
Just wiggle your fingers.

210
00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:37,059
Got it. Okay.

211
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:39,283
Let me do it. Okay.

212
00:08:47,544 --> 00:08:49,293
Yeah, okay. How
about just one finger?

213
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,512
Now just a finger? Mmm-hmm.

214
00:08:51,581 --> 00:08:52,625
Which one?

215
00:08:52,649 --> 00:08:53,815
Your choice.

216
00:08:53,883 --> 00:08:55,367
Keep it clean, though.

217
00:08:55,435 --> 00:08:56,634
And just try to relax.

218
00:08:58,605 --> 00:09:00,021
I'm pretty relaxed, John.

219
00:09:01,975 --> 00:09:03,758
Not gonna distract you.

220
00:09:03,827 --> 00:09:05,627
I'm just gonna go grab a bite.

221
00:09:05,662 --> 00:09:06,895
Do you want anything?

222
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:08,523
I wanna move this stupid finger.

223
00:09:09,316 --> 00:09:10,415
You can do it.

224
00:09:16,272 --> 00:09:17,272
Try again?

225
00:09:18,174 --> 00:09:19,273
Whenever you're ready.

226
00:09:25,782 --> 00:09:27,015
Damn it!

227
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:29,534
You put the sensors
in weeks ago.

228
00:09:29,603 --> 00:09:32,354
I haven't moved
the damn thing once.

229
00:09:32,422 --> 00:09:36,391
You will. Just focus
on wiggling the fingers.

230
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:37,620
Okay? Just bend it from here...

231
00:09:37,644 --> 00:09:39,884
I can't focus on anything
with you talking at me.

232
00:09:49,323 --> 00:09:52,507
Okay, hang a banana bag
and give him two of Ativan.

233
00:09:52,576 --> 00:09:54,976
I've treated him before.
He's a heroin addict.

234
00:09:55,045 --> 00:09:58,212
Okay, let's, uh, start a tox screen
and start him on methadone.

235
00:09:58,281 --> 00:09:59,397
No.

236
00:09:59,949 --> 00:10:01,132
No methadone.

237
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:02,967
The methadone
will help you detox.

238
00:10:03,036 --> 00:10:05,152
I haven't used in months.

239
00:10:05,222 --> 00:10:09,090
I gotta get totally clean.
Off the methadone, too.

240
00:10:09,158 --> 00:10:10,742
I gotta do it.

241
00:10:10,811 --> 00:10:12,143
Let me do it.

242
00:10:14,497 --> 00:10:15,930
Okay, then. No methadone.

243
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:19,851
Let's admit him and watch him.

244
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,081
Can we send him
to a rehab facility?

245
00:10:22,105 --> 00:10:24,772
He's... He's Alex's dad.

246
00:10:24,841 --> 00:10:26,986
There's history.
Like, bad history.

247
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:28,860
I don't care who he is.

248
00:10:28,929 --> 00:10:30,261
For you, he is a patient

249
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:32,330
who had heart surgery
less than three months ago.

250
00:10:32,366 --> 00:10:34,783
And you are his
doctor, so act like it.

251
00:10:34,851 --> 00:10:36,050
Get him admitted.

252
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:40,705
Oh, uh, Dr. Hunt? Hey, I did it.

253
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:44,542
Um, I did two days with her
following me around everywhere I go.

254
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:47,712
I don't need help anymore.
I'm doing really well.

255
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,547
You're pulling
your fingers again.

256
00:10:49,615 --> 00:10:51,655
Oh, God! Go away.

257
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:54,919
Uh, look, I... I just wanna
be cleared for surgery.

258
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:57,088
Dr. Alma, is she
clear for surgery?

259
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:58,690
No, she's not.

260
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:02,239
Hmm. Dr. Bailey, you're not
clear until she says you're clear.

261
00:11:06,216 --> 00:11:07,848
Okay, um...

262
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:11,013
We need to fast track this

263
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:13,822
because I have patients trying
to schedule surgeries. So...

264
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:17,436
Just... Just tell me what hoop

265
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,860
I need to jump through
for you to clear me.

266
00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:25,383
And this is the ER, where
I spend most of my time.

267
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:27,171
I kind of run it.

268
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:30,305
Ah, hey. Who's this?

269
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:32,390
These are my sisters. ALL: Hi.

270
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:34,258
Hi, I'm Arizona Robbins. It's...

271
00:11:34,327 --> 00:11:35,527
Arizona!

272
00:11:35,578 --> 00:11:37,689
I feel like I know you.

273
00:11:37,713 --> 00:11:39,792
April told us
everything about you.

274
00:11:39,816 --> 00:11:43,401
Are you gonna make it to the
shower? We throw the best showers.

275
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:44,719
I... I wouldn't miss it.

276
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:47,049
I have a cat at
home who lost a leg.

277
00:11:47,073 --> 00:11:50,041
Every time I see
him hopping around,

278
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:53,093
I just think that
is real strength.

279
00:11:53,163 --> 00:11:54,762
Stop talking. Well...

280
00:11:54,831 --> 00:11:56,275
It was super nice
to meet you guys.

281
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:58,099
And I will see
you at the shower.

282
00:12:00,137 --> 00:12:01,881
She is such a good walker.

283
00:12:01,905 --> 00:12:04,071
Okay, um, I'm just
gonna get dressed.

284
00:12:04,141 --> 00:12:05,218
And then we'll head out. Okay?

285
00:12:05,242 --> 00:12:06,491
Coming through!

286
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,309
32-year-old male.
We just lost his airway.

287
00:12:08,377 --> 00:12:10,077
I'm gonna change it over a wire.

288
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:12,391
We need a 5-millimeter shiley and
a percutaneous trach kit right away.

289
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:14,249
Let's get him set
up for transfer.

290
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:16,550
By my count, one, two, three.

291
00:12:17,954 --> 00:12:19,314
All right, let's go,
betadine the neck.

292
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:20,533
He couldn't breathe,
so I trached him.

293
00:12:20,557 --> 00:12:22,456
You trached him?
Oh, yeah, he did.

294
00:12:22,525 --> 00:12:24,158
Took out his little
Boy Scout knife

295
00:12:24,227 --> 00:12:26,905
and sliced a wide and
horizontal incision into his throat,

296
00:12:26,929 --> 00:12:27,973
way lower than it needed to be.

297
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:30,130
All things I'm gonna
need to fix in surgery.

298
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:33,701
Ready?

299
00:12:33,787 --> 00:12:34,919
Whoa!

300
00:12:34,988 --> 00:12:36,282
Mother of... Sick.

301
00:12:36,306 --> 00:12:37,900
You guys cannot
be in here. Damn it.

302
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:39,301
All right, let the OR
know that we gotta

303
00:12:39,325 --> 00:12:40,736
come up there and fix your mess.

304
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,521
Hey, I had to do it like that.
When you take a closer look,

305
00:12:42,545 --> 00:12:44,140
you're gonna see that. It
doesn't matter right now.

306
00:12:44,164 --> 00:12:45,741
What matters is we have
to get him ready for transfer.

307
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,565
So, can you just take
my sisters and go now?

308
00:12:54,557 --> 00:12:55,735
Alex, I have to
tell you something

309
00:12:55,759 --> 00:12:56,836
that you're not
gonna wanna hear.

310
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,425
Well, then don't tell me.

311
00:12:58,494 --> 00:13:00,639
Your dad's here. Jimmy's here.

312
00:13:00,663 --> 00:13:02,147
What? Why?

313
00:13:02,215 --> 00:13:03,442
He's going through withdrawal.

314
00:13:03,466 --> 00:13:05,733
Kick him out. I can't.

315
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:08,436
I can. Alex...

316
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:10,871
Get up.

317
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,294
Hey, son. How you doin'?

318
00:13:21,417 --> 00:13:23,095
You're not staying here.

319
00:13:23,119 --> 00:13:25,097
We've helped you once.
We're not helping you with this.

320
00:13:25,121 --> 00:13:26,971
Alex... Son, listen...

321
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,741
Oh, stop calling me
that. I know who you are.

322
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,053
I didn't remember...
I don't care.

323
00:13:31,077 --> 00:13:33,928
I didn't remember till
I saw you pissed off,

324
00:13:33,996 --> 00:13:35,524
till I saw you standing over me.

325
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:39,250
Like when you were 15, you
said you wished I was dead.

326
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:42,336
I've been trying to get right
since the bar. I'm still trying.

327
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:43,805
Not here. No, Alex, stop.

328
00:13:43,873 --> 00:13:45,518
I'm not gonna help a
guy who made my life hell.

329
00:13:45,542 --> 00:13:47,074
No, you're not. But I am because

330
00:13:47,143 --> 00:13:48,592
he needs help and I'm a doctor.

331
00:13:49,863 --> 00:13:52,347
You can go. I got
this. Really, it's okay.

332
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:00,671
So it's not the sensors.
Is it the coding?

333
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,940
Coding's been
tested and retested.

334
00:14:02,976 --> 00:14:04,125
So it's Becca.

335
00:14:04,193 --> 00:14:06,226
It's Becca.

336
00:14:06,295 --> 00:14:08,535
Look, she is not the
most positive person.

337
00:14:08,565 --> 00:14:09,609
I mean, every day it's a fight.

338
00:14:09,633 --> 00:14:10,948
But she's trying.

339
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:13,177
She's no ray of
sunshine, but she's trying.

340
00:14:15,638 --> 00:14:17,666
Uh, maybe it's me.
Maybe it's not Becca.

341
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:20,810
Maybe I'm just not saying
the right thing to get her to do it.

342
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:29,400
It may surprise you to learn
that I am quite good at sutures.

343
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:31,548
It wouldn't surprise
me in the least.

344
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:32,848
What would surprise me is,

345
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:35,306
if you were able
to do five of them

346
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:37,786
without engaging
in OCD behaviors.

347
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:42,246
And if I can, you'll sign off
so I can go back to work?

348
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,439
That's the deal.

349
00:14:45,067 --> 00:14:46,166
Five sutures.

350
00:14:46,902 --> 00:14:47,935
That's all?

351
00:14:48,004 --> 00:14:49,037
That's all.

352
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:53,407
Game on.

353
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:55,977
Uh... Just a sec.

354
00:15:09,526 --> 00:15:13,343
Now, only use the tools
to your immediate right.

355
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,980
If you touch any of
the trays, we start over.

356
00:15:16,049 --> 00:15:19,634
If you count your fingers, if
you double-check a stitch,

357
00:15:19,702 --> 00:15:23,988
if you rearrange any of the
instruments on the trays, we start over.

358
00:15:24,057 --> 00:15:26,791
Five sutures.
Whenever you're ready.

359
00:15:35,084 --> 00:15:37,618
I can't believe you yelled at
Matthew in front of my sisters.

360
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:39,431
Now they're gonna think
I'm engaged to a nitwit.

361
00:15:39,455 --> 00:15:41,575
All right, Duckie...
Don't call me Duckie!

362
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:45,959
Okay.

363
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:47,595
It means "Ugly duckling."

364
00:15:47,663 --> 00:15:50,063
Because I grew up
with braces and pimples,

365
00:15:50,132 --> 00:15:51,549
and they still see me that way.

366
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:54,701
It's like idiot incapable
of doing anything right.

367
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:56,303
I'm a freaking trauma surgeon!

368
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:00,358
He did a great job.

369
00:16:00,427 --> 00:16:02,827
Actually, I would've done
exactly the same thing.

370
00:16:03,229 --> 00:16:05,830
Matthew was right? Yeah.

371
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:09,467
You should go spread the word.
You are not engaged to a nitwit.

372
00:16:09,536 --> 00:16:12,603
You know what, this is actually
gonna be a pretty easy fix.

373
00:16:12,672 --> 00:16:15,712
So why don't you just
go ahead and go? I got it.

374
00:16:15,942 --> 00:16:17,141
Really? I was kinda hopin'

375
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:19,827
that I could hide
out here all day.

376
00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:23,096
They came all this way
to see you. You should go.

377
00:16:25,251 --> 00:16:27,051
Smile.

378
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:29,387
Edwards, can we stop
fiddling with the camera?

379
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:30,754
And let's get started.

380
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:37,678
Getting proximal
vascular control.

381
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:40,814
She said she's getting
proximal vascular control.

382
00:16:40,883 --> 00:16:43,195
You're changing the face of
medicine, you need to be louder.

383
00:16:43,219 --> 00:16:46,687
Do you know who doesn't talk
about changing the face of medicine?

384
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:48,333
People who change
the face of medicine.

385
00:16:48,357 --> 00:16:49,990
They just do their job.

386
00:16:51,226 --> 00:16:56,564
Okay, preparing to
place the portal vein.

387
00:16:56,633 --> 00:16:58,616
Doctor...

388
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:02,119
Dr. Yang, surgeons at
Baylor have joined us.

389
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:05,450
Okay, at this point, I have
dissected the scar tissue

390
00:17:05,474 --> 00:17:07,586
and put the patient on bypass.

391
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:09,026
Timing is everything.

392
00:17:09,095 --> 00:17:10,628
We just received word that

393
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,741
the conduit has gone
through its final round of tests

394
00:17:12,765 --> 00:17:14,631
and is on its way to the OR.

395
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,346
While we wait, Dr. Karev
can give a brief patient history.

396
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:21,305
Nine-month-old born with
hypoplastic left heart syndrome.

397
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:24,741
He's rejected the synthetic
conduit that was previously placed.

398
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:28,062
This conduit was granted by
the FDA with compassionate use.

399
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,384
This is Dr. Ross.

400
00:17:33,453 --> 00:17:37,070
And this is the conduit we
printed on the 3D printer.

401
00:17:38,575 --> 00:17:39,823
All right.

402
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:42,092
Okay, let's commence with
the implantation process.

403
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:45,196
Declamping the portal vein.

404
00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:46,931
Oh! We have blood flow!

405
00:17:47,817 --> 00:17:49,249
Okay, let's recheck vitals.

406
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:51,819
Oh, uh, blood
pressure's 115 over 75.

407
00:17:51,888 --> 00:17:53,804
Blood pressure's falling.

408
00:17:53,872 --> 00:17:56,335
You know, the conduit is a
little smaller than anticipated.

409
00:17:56,359 --> 00:17:58,199
I'm gonna do a
triangular cut with a patch.

410
00:17:59,946 --> 00:18:02,341
<i>Call the lab and try to...</i>

411
00:18:02,365 --> 00:18:04,646
Excuse me. <i>Global testing.</i>

412
00:18:04,701 --> 00:18:05,966
Did she move her hand?

413
00:18:07,236 --> 00:18:08,969
No. That sucks.

414
00:18:09,038 --> 00:18:10,388
Yeah.

415
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:12,723
Well, it's just
takes time, right?

416
00:18:12,792 --> 00:18:14,492
I don't know.

417
00:18:14,561 --> 00:18:15,761
Well, cheer up.

418
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:18,529
Why?

419
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:21,065
My research just stalled.
Why would I cheer up?

420
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:23,918
I don't know.

421
00:18:23,987 --> 00:18:26,370
I don't know, that's just
something that people say...

422
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:29,339
I know, I know. I'm
just... Let's not fight.

423
00:18:29,408 --> 00:18:31,375
Callie, I... I should get back.

424
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:33,622
<i>All of our preliminary
testing, however...</i>

425
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,291
Wow! Did you see that?

426
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:37,414
Yeah, that was intense.

427
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:38,649
Mmm-hmm.

428
00:18:38,717 --> 00:18:40,197
Do you think they're
gonna break up?

429
00:18:45,891 --> 00:18:47,658
CVP is low, he doesn't
have enough volume.

430
00:18:47,726 --> 00:18:49,571
Okay, uh, give
another, uh, bolus of LR.

431
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:50,905
You're gonna fluid overload him.

432
00:18:50,929 --> 00:18:52,541
What's that piece
sticking up on the conduit?

433
00:18:52,565 --> 00:18:55,383
Is there a gap in the
anastomosis? Dr. Yang?

434
00:18:57,053 --> 00:18:58,485
Say something.

435
00:18:58,555 --> 00:18:59,720
For posterity.

436
00:18:59,789 --> 00:19:01,500
Uh, this is Dr. Meredith Grey.

437
00:19:01,524 --> 00:19:03,390
Today, we implanted

438
00:19:03,459 --> 00:19:06,777
a 3D-printed portal vein
with seeded cells into a sheep.

439
00:19:06,846 --> 00:19:08,595
Currently, her
vitals are stable,

440
00:19:08,664 --> 00:19:12,616
and Dr. Edwards will continue
to monitor her via ultrasound.

441
00:19:12,685 --> 00:19:15,019
Our hope is that the portal vein

442
00:19:15,088 --> 00:19:17,321
will continue to
heal, without stenosis.

443
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:20,369
SHANE: He's in V-fib.

444
00:19:20,393 --> 00:19:22,426
Damn it. Starting CPR.

445
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,822
- Internal paddles.
- Okay.

446
00:19:23,846 --> 00:19:25,129
Charge to 10.

447
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:26,925
Turn the camera off.

448
00:19:26,949 --> 00:19:28,932
Clear.

449
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:30,367
Ross, get the camera off.

450
00:19:30,436 --> 00:19:31,735
Stop filming.

451
00:19:39,312 --> 00:19:42,191
We've sat outside all night
long waiting to hold him,

452
00:19:42,215 --> 00:19:44,109
and now you're telling us
that we have to wait longer?

453
00:19:44,133 --> 00:19:45,978
Nathan's numbers still
aren't stable enough for...

454
00:19:46,002 --> 00:19:47,729
We should've never
let you talk us into this.

455
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:49,365
We should've gone
with the synthetic graft.

456
00:19:49,389 --> 00:19:51,433
We should've listened
to you. It's still early.

457
00:19:51,457 --> 00:19:53,524
The conduit could
still be a success.

458
00:19:53,593 --> 00:19:54,925
Do you believe that?

459
00:19:54,994 --> 00:19:57,144
Look me in the eye and
tell me you believe that.

460
00:20:00,232 --> 00:20:02,366
Let's focus on what we know.

461
00:20:02,435 --> 00:20:04,095
Right now, he's
on the oscillator

462
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:05,686
to force oxygen into his lungs,

463
00:20:05,755 --> 00:20:07,065
and if he can maintain his sats,

464
00:20:07,089 --> 00:20:09,609
we hope to be able to get
him on a normal ventilator.

465
00:20:10,059 --> 00:20:11,525
One step at a time.

466
00:20:12,195 --> 00:20:13,294
Okay?

467
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,366
Nurses' station.

468
00:20:19,435 --> 00:20:21,419
Thanks for the strong
show of support.

469
00:20:21,487 --> 00:20:22,753
Sorry, I've got...

470
00:20:22,821 --> 00:20:24,016
I got a lot on my mind.

471
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,155
Alex...

472
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:26,869
Yeah, it's just been
a crap couple of days.

473
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:28,092
Alex...

474
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:33,159
Do you really think the
conduit's gonna be a success?

475
00:20:33,199 --> 00:20:34,898
I don't know. I hope so.

476
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:44,024
Do you want another blanket?

477
00:20:44,627 --> 00:20:45,860
Where's Alex?

478
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,179
Alex, come here!

479
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,047
Shh. I'm here.

480
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:53,633
Who broke this?

481
00:20:53,703 --> 00:20:55,169
Where's he at?

482
00:20:55,237 --> 00:20:56,770
Jimmy, Alex isn't coming back.

483
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:58,004
Just tell me what you need.

484
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:04,962
Helen, you let the damn
kid do whatever he wants.

485
00:21:05,031 --> 00:21:08,591
I told him not to play with
my stuff. Now look at this!

486
00:21:08,635 --> 00:21:09,875
Alex! Look at this!

487
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:12,236
Jimmy. Jimmy.

488
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:16,474
It's Dr. Wilson, you're detoxing,
which causes hallucinations.

489
00:21:16,542 --> 00:21:17,875
Ah!

490
00:21:17,944 --> 00:21:22,513
Oh, God! Don't start that
crap with me right now.

491
00:21:22,582 --> 00:21:23,659
Helen...

492
00:21:23,683 --> 00:21:24,923
I swear to God.

493
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:29,153
I...

494
00:21:29,221 --> 00:21:30,821
Shh. Alex.

495
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:32,023
Okay. Okay.

496
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:35,609
Okay.

497
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:39,630
Okay. Shh.

498
00:21:46,422 --> 00:21:48,367
Dr. Ross, how's it going?

499
00:21:48,391 --> 00:21:49,522
Don't be smug.

500
00:21:50,626 --> 00:21:51,742
What?

501
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:53,410
You won, we lost. I get it.

502
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:56,730
Dr. Ross, you do not
get to talk to me that way.

503
00:21:58,233 --> 00:21:59,499
Congratulations.

504
00:22:00,686 --> 00:22:02,853
Dr. Ross, get back here!

505
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:08,103
Nurses' station. Please hold.

506
00:22:08,127 --> 00:22:09,576
Where's April?

507
00:22:09,645 --> 00:22:10,811
Oh! Um...

508
00:22:10,879 --> 00:22:12,757
A trauma came in. She
got pulled into surgery.

509
00:22:12,781 --> 00:22:14,443
You know, I don't
know how long she'll be.

510
00:22:14,467 --> 00:22:16,650
So, what? We just
cancel the shower?

511
00:22:16,718 --> 00:22:19,164
We already paid for the
flowers, the food, the champagne.

512
00:22:19,188 --> 00:22:20,598
When she came in
this morning to work,

513
00:22:20,622 --> 00:22:22,189
she promised she'd
be done on time.

514
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:24,908
Yeah, we say a lot of things.

515
00:22:24,977 --> 00:22:26,805
Look, we're just not in
charge of our schedule.

516
00:22:26,829 --> 00:22:27,995
This is just how it works.

517
00:22:28,064 --> 00:22:29,362
Why do you live this way?

518
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:30,864
Because we save people's lives.

519
00:22:32,134 --> 00:22:33,467
She'll pop in at some point.

520
00:22:33,536 --> 00:22:35,964
No, it's her shower.
She can't just pop.

521
00:22:35,988 --> 00:22:37,655
You may have
to settle for a pop.

522
00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:48,432
Done.

523
00:22:49,602 --> 00:22:52,169
See? Two down, three to go.

524
00:22:52,237 --> 00:22:55,489
I thought that a good night's
sleep was gonna make it easier.

525
00:23:02,415 --> 00:23:04,682
You know what
will make it easier.

526
00:23:04,751 --> 00:23:07,385
Miranda, I hate to
see you suffer like this.

527
00:23:07,453 --> 00:23:08,886
Take the medication.

528
00:23:08,954 --> 00:23:10,921
Two down, three to go.

529
00:23:13,325 --> 00:23:16,427
Okay, okay, um, why don't
we take a five minute break?

530
00:23:17,797 --> 00:23:19,277
I'm gonna go visit
the ladies' room.

531
00:23:20,766 --> 00:23:21,965
And, um...

532
00:23:26,539 --> 00:23:27,754
Just for reference.

533
00:23:27,824 --> 00:23:29,840
Oh...

534
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:31,074
I'll be back.

535
00:24:04,894 --> 00:24:06,604
Sir, what are you doing here?

536
00:24:06,628 --> 00:24:10,180
Well, if I was gonna come back
to work, I need to practice my skills.

537
00:24:10,249 --> 00:24:13,534
But you are jeopardizing
your recovery.

538
00:24:13,603 --> 00:24:15,836
You should be home, not...

539
00:24:15,904 --> 00:24:18,004
Sitting on the couch,
flipping through the channels

540
00:24:18,073 --> 00:24:21,057
isn't gonna get me back
to work in an OR any faster.

541
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:24,078
I mean, I'm sitting there
watching housewives flip tables

542
00:24:24,146 --> 00:24:26,279
and celebs flip houses.

543
00:24:26,348 --> 00:24:30,284
And pretty soon, it's just like I could
feel my brain cells wither and die.

544
00:24:33,672 --> 00:24:35,839
Bailey, these trays are a mess.

545
00:24:35,907 --> 00:24:38,027
I don't know how you
expect to find anything on 'em.

546
00:24:42,014 --> 00:24:46,166
Okay, now visualize the ligaments
in your right index finger contracting.

547
00:24:55,945 --> 00:24:58,462
Stupid, stupid, stupid.

548
00:24:58,531 --> 00:25:01,214
Hey, babe. They got
those chips you like.

549
00:25:01,283 --> 00:25:02,950
John, leave us alone.

550
00:25:03,018 --> 00:25:04,651
I'm sorry.

551
00:25:04,719 --> 00:25:08,116
Just wait outside, and
I'll call you when I'm done.

552
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:09,506
Just go.

553
00:25:18,217 --> 00:25:19,649
My God!

554
00:25:20,886 --> 00:25:22,180
Did you see that?

555
00:25:22,204 --> 00:25:23,787
I just keep snapping at him.

556
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:27,958
And pretty soon, we can't
even look at each other.

557
00:25:28,027 --> 00:25:30,293
It's awful. I'm awful.

558
00:25:33,115 --> 00:25:38,719
Because he does
everything for me.

559
00:25:40,589 --> 00:25:43,140
And I started this
because I wanted

560
00:25:43,209 --> 00:25:45,659
to do something
for him for once.

561
00:25:47,062 --> 00:25:49,830
And it seemed like
something I could do.

562
00:25:51,366 --> 00:25:55,119
- I just wanted to do...
- One damn thing.

563
00:25:57,223 --> 00:25:58,722
And I can't.

564
00:25:59,825 --> 00:26:01,759
I'm done.

565
00:26:01,827 --> 00:26:03,360
I can't do this anymore.

566
00:26:05,531 --> 00:26:08,932
Okay. Let's take a break.

567
00:26:09,001 --> 00:26:10,462
No, you're not hearing me.

568
00:26:10,486 --> 00:26:12,853
I don't wanna do this anymore.

569
00:26:12,921 --> 00:26:16,256
I can't. I hate this.

570
00:26:16,324 --> 00:26:19,409
Take this crap out of my head.

571
00:26:20,963 --> 00:26:22,574
Do you wanna schedule
surgery to have them taken out?

572
00:26:22,598 --> 00:26:24,331
Dr. Torres, we
are not there yet.

573
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,627
Well, if she doesn't
wanna keep...

574
00:26:25,651 --> 00:26:26,971
Dr. Torres, may I talk with you?

575
00:26:27,936 --> 00:26:28,969
Yeah.

576
00:26:29,038 --> 00:26:30,186
Excuse us.

577
00:26:33,692 --> 00:26:37,177
No, no, no, no, no, no! No.

578
00:26:37,246 --> 00:26:40,141
She distended. She
dropped pressure and flatlined.

579
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:48,250
She's been down for
20 minutes, Dr. Edwards.

580
00:26:50,425 --> 00:26:51,642
It's over.

581
00:26:56,848 --> 00:26:58,815
So sorry, little girl.

582
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:03,453
We tried.

583
00:27:03,522 --> 00:27:07,140
Edwards, do you know how many
dogs the Russians sent into space

584
00:27:07,209 --> 00:27:08,537
before a man walked on the moon?

585
00:27:08,561 --> 00:27:10,461
Those poor puppies.

586
00:27:10,529 --> 00:27:13,380
Edwards, we are
going to do a necropsy,

587
00:27:13,449 --> 00:27:15,982
and we are going to
find out what went wrong.

588
00:27:16,052 --> 00:27:19,319
And then we'll try
again, and we'll fail again,

589
00:27:19,388 --> 00:27:21,783
because that's what
progress looks like.

590
00:27:21,807 --> 00:27:23,573
Progress looks
like a dead sheep.

591
00:27:23,643 --> 00:27:27,627
No, progress looks
like a bunch of failures.

592
00:27:27,696 --> 00:27:30,408
And you're gonna have feelings
about that because it's sad,

593
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:31,881
but you can't fall apart.

594
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:33,561
And then one day,
we will succeed,

595
00:27:33,585 --> 00:27:35,613
and we will save
a person's life.

596
00:27:35,637 --> 00:27:37,877
And we will walk on the moon.

597
00:27:38,807 --> 00:27:40,047
Figuratively, anyway.

598
00:27:42,695 --> 00:27:44,160
Are you with me?

599
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:47,747
Yeah.

600
00:27:47,816 --> 00:27:49,266
She hates being here.

601
00:27:49,335 --> 00:27:51,646
- She shows up every day.
- She is trying.

602
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:53,803
No, I can't fight
anymore. Every day.

603
00:27:53,872 --> 00:27:56,153
Every day is a fight.
My whole world is a fight.

604
00:27:56,208 --> 00:27:57,752
At home, I fight with
Arizona, and then I come here

605
00:27:57,776 --> 00:28:00,177
and fight with Becca, and
now I'm fighting with you.

606
00:28:00,245 --> 00:28:01,473
Well, we just haven't
figured it out yet.

607
00:28:01,497 --> 00:28:02,640
How to get her to do it.

608
00:28:02,664 --> 00:28:04,176
So we're frustrated,
and she's frustrated.

609
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,933
Mmm.

610
00:28:06,001 --> 00:28:09,121
Is it wrong that I wish that
water were a bottle of gin?

611
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,680
Is that gonna be for me or...

612
00:28:18,898 --> 00:28:20,230
We need to talk to Becca.

613
00:28:24,653 --> 00:28:26,998
It is so great that you two
are trying to work things out.

614
00:28:27,022 --> 00:28:29,222
It is so much
better for the kids.

615
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:33,126
Duckie doesn't know this,
but my husband had an affair.

616
00:28:34,146 --> 00:28:35,579
Oh, that's...

617
00:28:35,647 --> 00:28:39,583
We have, uh, three boys,
so we stayed together.

618
00:28:40,586 --> 00:28:41,830
Wow, so, did you go to therapy?

619
00:28:41,854 --> 00:28:43,131
Because we can't
even agree on that.

620
00:28:43,155 --> 00:28:44,395
Oh, no. Mmm-mmm.

621
00:28:44,423 --> 00:28:46,100
We didn't feel the
need to talk it to death.

622
00:28:46,124 --> 00:28:50,194
We just focused on moving
forward, putting it in the past.

623
00:28:50,262 --> 00:28:52,507
Oh. Hoping things
would get better one day.

624
00:28:52,531 --> 00:28:53,680
So, well, did that work?

625
00:28:57,669 --> 00:29:00,637
Well, we are still
getting through it.

626
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,606
And we're back to two.

627
00:29:19,675 --> 00:29:21,085
Let's try for a third.

628
00:29:21,109 --> 00:29:22,576
No, no, this is the seventh.

629
00:29:22,644 --> 00:29:24,777
Two stitches ago, you
tugged on your fingers.

630
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:25,945
Two before that,

631
00:29:26,015 --> 00:29:27,492
you straightened an
instrument on the tray.

632
00:29:27,516 --> 00:29:29,427
Look, I can't... I can't
keep doing this. I can't...

633
00:29:29,451 --> 00:29:30,901
I know.

634
00:29:30,969 --> 00:29:33,831
Then you really need to
consider taking the medication.

635
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:35,622
Okay, no, I'm not
taking the damn pills!

636
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:43,029
Bailey, I was gonna head up to
Kepner's shower to steal some food.

637
00:29:43,098 --> 00:29:44,275
Come with me.

638
00:29:44,299 --> 00:29:46,459
You just need a break. I need...

639
00:29:49,989 --> 00:29:51,721
To get back into surgery.

640
00:29:59,248 --> 00:30:01,748
I heard Nathan's
not doing so well.

641
00:30:01,817 --> 00:30:04,050
I'm sorry.

642
00:30:04,119 --> 00:30:06,853
Yeah, I'm trying to figure out
if there's a plan B we can try.

643
00:30:06,922 --> 00:30:08,488
But I don't even
know if he's gonna...

644
00:30:10,593 --> 00:30:12,392
I heard your sheep
did great. Congrats.

645
00:30:13,995 --> 00:30:16,395
Thanks. Actually,
the sheep died.

646
00:30:17,516 --> 00:30:19,396
Oh, sorry.

647
00:30:20,251 --> 00:30:21,451
Did you need the printer?

648
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,764
Yeah, but if you need it more...

649
00:30:22,788 --> 00:30:25,021
No, I'll finish this up,
and then it's all yours.

650
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:27,690
So can I ask you a
question, um, about Ross?

651
00:30:29,427 --> 00:30:30,627
Yeah, what about him?

652
00:30:30,696 --> 00:30:31,995
He seems different.

653
00:30:32,064 --> 00:30:34,097
Do you notice that?

654
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:35,765
Well, no, not really.

655
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:37,862
Well, he's not the same guy
he was when he started here.

656
00:30:37,886 --> 00:30:39,714
He's not the guy who
delivered my baby.

657
00:30:39,738 --> 00:30:42,184
Yeah, well, we're not the same
as when we were interns either.

658
00:30:42,208 --> 00:30:45,459
Well, I understand that. But
he is aggressive and mean.

659
00:30:47,162 --> 00:30:49,996
I don't know, I mean, he spends
a lot of time on your service.

660
00:30:50,065 --> 00:30:51,592
Do you think he's
trying to be like you?

661
00:30:51,616 --> 00:30:52,916
Or... Do you notice that?

662
00:30:52,985 --> 00:30:54,217
I'm sorry.

663
00:30:54,286 --> 00:30:56,386
Are you saying I
taught him to be mean?

664
00:30:56,454 --> 00:30:57,632
That's what he's
learned from me?

665
00:30:57,656 --> 00:30:59,022
No.

666
00:30:59,091 --> 00:31:01,491
Because a little edge is not
the worst thing for a surgeon.

667
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:02,754
I understand that.

668
00:31:02,778 --> 00:31:04,171
And I am not
mean. I am effective.

669
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:05,356
Are you implying that I'm not?

670
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:07,630
Well, no, you just
said I ruined a resident.

671
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:08,999
No, that is not what I said.

672
00:31:09,068 --> 00:31:11,685
I said something
is off about Ross.

673
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:13,503
Well, maybe he
got tired of people

674
00:31:13,572 --> 00:31:15,138
thinking he was soft
around the edges.

675
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:18,041
Maybe his focus is being a
doctor and not a flight attendant.

676
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:21,344
And my job is his surgical
skill, not his personality.

677
00:31:32,407 --> 00:31:33,952
Talk to me, Ross.
What's going on?

678
00:31:33,976 --> 00:31:35,809
Nathan's O-2 sats
are stable, so...

679
00:31:35,878 --> 00:31:38,118
Dr. Ross says
that's a good sign.

680
00:31:39,864 --> 00:31:41,198
It's an excellent sign.

681
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:44,012
He can come off the oscillator.

682
00:31:44,036 --> 00:31:45,785
It's working?

683
00:31:47,422 --> 00:31:48,488
I think so.

684
00:32:03,355 --> 00:32:04,520
Yes!

685
00:32:13,699 --> 00:32:14,939
Helen!

686
00:32:18,503 --> 00:32:20,353
Jimmy. Where are the car keys?

687
00:32:20,422 --> 00:32:21,566
You didn't get Alex.

688
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:22,590
Jimmy, it's all right.

689
00:32:22,658 --> 00:32:23,823
Let's just take you...

690
00:32:23,892 --> 00:32:24,935
He's... He's still
out there waiting.

691
00:32:24,959 --> 00:32:26,654
You said you'd get
him. I come home,

692
00:32:26,678 --> 00:32:28,323
you're just sitting
on the bedroom floor!

693
00:32:28,347 --> 00:32:29,529
Alex is all right, Jimmy.

694
00:32:29,598 --> 00:32:31,209
It's after dark! He
could be anywhere!

695
00:32:32,334 --> 00:32:33,995
You stupid... Leave her alone!

696
00:32:36,171 --> 00:32:37,787
Get out of here! Go!

697
00:32:41,777 --> 00:32:44,327
She was supposed to
get you. I was afraid you...

698
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:45,679
Just shut up!

699
00:32:45,748 --> 00:32:46,947
Alex, please! Alex, don't!

700
00:32:49,068 --> 00:32:50,788
Go sleep it off!

701
00:32:52,204 --> 00:32:53,920
Come on. Go get some sleep.

702
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:05,549
You okay?

703
00:33:05,617 --> 00:33:06,683
Yeah.

704
00:33:09,154 --> 00:33:10,994
I'm sorry. Why are you sorry?

705
00:33:11,907 --> 00:33:14,808
He's a junkie. She was crazy.

706
00:33:14,877 --> 00:33:17,277
I started running interference
for them when I was six.

707
00:33:17,345 --> 00:33:18,611
It's like riding a bike.

708
00:33:21,266 --> 00:33:24,401
I'm just asking
for one more time.

709
00:33:24,469 --> 00:33:26,403
Last time, I swear.

710
00:33:26,471 --> 00:33:27,648
If you wanna go, we can just...

711
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:29,172
John, hush.

712
00:33:29,241 --> 00:33:31,681
Fine, you wanna waste your time?

713
00:33:31,976 --> 00:33:33,243
I don't care.

714
00:33:33,311 --> 00:33:36,146
All right. I'll be outside.

715
00:33:36,214 --> 00:33:38,148
Actually, John,
we need you here.

716
00:33:38,216 --> 00:33:39,982
You're gonna stand
right here, okay?

717
00:33:40,985 --> 00:33:42,085
Okay.

718
00:33:43,255 --> 00:33:44,954
When you're thirsty,

719
00:33:45,024 --> 00:33:47,124
you don't think about
moving your fingers

720
00:33:47,192 --> 00:33:49,359
or grasping the cup.

721
00:33:49,428 --> 00:33:52,095
You just get a drink,
and the rest follows.

722
00:33:53,231 --> 00:33:55,815
Becca, I want you
to look at John.

723
00:34:00,322 --> 00:34:01,438
Hi.

724
00:34:05,344 --> 00:34:07,110
When do I move
the hand? You don't.

725
00:34:08,413 --> 00:34:10,413
Just look at John.

726
00:34:10,481 --> 00:34:12,766
Think about what
you want to say to him.

727
00:34:12,834 --> 00:34:14,450
You don't have to say it.

728
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:15,785
Just think about it.

729
00:34:24,963 --> 00:34:26,680
Did it just... Shh.

730
00:34:28,032 --> 00:34:29,165
Look at John.

731
00:34:31,869 --> 00:34:33,336
What do you want to say to him?

732
00:34:51,472 --> 00:34:52,822
Becca...

733
00:34:54,192 --> 00:34:55,559
Becca, you touched me.

734
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:00,096
I never thought
you'd do that again.

735
00:35:03,835 --> 00:35:05,101
Me, neither.

736
00:35:07,673 --> 00:35:09,773
Oh, I'm sorry.

737
00:35:16,899 --> 00:35:18,526
Oh! You are gonna
love that thing.

738
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:20,183
I use mine all the time.

739
00:35:20,252 --> 00:35:21,292
Great!

740
00:35:21,336 --> 00:35:22,569
It's a salad spinner.

741
00:35:23,388 --> 00:35:24,554
I don't know what it does.

742
00:35:24,623 --> 00:35:27,790
But the guy at the store
recommended it and...

743
00:35:27,859 --> 00:35:29,904
The receipt is on the
back. Thank you, Mer.

744
00:35:29,928 --> 00:35:32,156
Ooh, another bow. Who's
making the ribbon bouquet?

745
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:33,613
Ooh, hey, yay.

746
00:35:33,681 --> 00:35:36,248
So she can carry it at
the rehearsal. Super fun.

747
00:35:36,952 --> 00:35:38,285
Ooh, we are late.

748
00:35:38,353 --> 00:35:39,663
Do you think she
noticed that we're late?

749
00:35:39,687 --> 00:35:41,687
I don't even think she
knows we're invited.

750
00:35:41,756 --> 00:35:43,835
- What did we miss?
- Um...

751
00:35:43,859 --> 00:35:47,376
Garlic press, coffee maker
and a delicious tray of bruschetta.

752
00:35:47,445 --> 00:35:48,478
Oh, beautiful!

753
00:35:49,714 --> 00:35:51,281
Did you even see what she got?

754
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:53,727
It doesn't matter, as long
as you say something nice.

755
00:35:53,751 --> 00:35:56,069
You gotta try the
quiche. Lovely!

756
00:35:56,137 --> 00:35:57,436
Love it. Fantastic!

757
00:35:57,505 --> 00:36:00,423
Okay, um, you know what?
This one is from your sisters.

758
00:36:00,475 --> 00:36:02,275
Oh, no, not that one.

759
00:36:02,344 --> 00:36:04,521
We wanted to save that
one, Duckie, to open in private.

760
00:36:04,545 --> 00:36:08,648
Oh, my God! You guys,
you actually remembered?

761
00:36:08,733 --> 00:36:11,751
You remembered how much
I wanna wear Mom's veil?

762
00:36:11,819 --> 00:36:13,297
No, we didn't. Grab it, Alice!

763
00:36:13,321 --> 00:36:14,421
I'm trying, stop!

764
00:36:15,189 --> 00:36:17,240
Oh, this isn't Mom's veil.

765
00:36:17,309 --> 00:36:18,675
Adorable!

766
00:36:18,743 --> 00:36:20,321
Delightful! It's not.

767
00:36:20,345 --> 00:36:22,707
We are sorry. That was
supposed to be for later.

768
00:36:22,731 --> 00:36:24,108
But since you've opened it...

769
00:36:24,132 --> 00:36:25,415
Surprise!

770
00:36:26,567 --> 00:36:27,678
It's for your wedding night,

771
00:36:27,702 --> 00:36:28,946
for when you and Matthew...

772
00:36:28,970 --> 00:36:30,136
Oh, God!

773
00:36:30,204 --> 00:36:31,565
There's no reason
to be embarrassed.

774
00:36:31,589 --> 00:36:33,989
We all had our first
times, too, right, ladies?

775
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:36,265
We wanted to give you
the lingerie and some tips.

776
00:36:36,294 --> 00:36:37,622
The pearls, by the
way, are for the inside...

777
00:36:37,646 --> 00:36:38,945
Stop. Just stop talking.

778
00:36:39,014 --> 00:36:41,058
But Matthew is your
first real boyfriend.

779
00:36:41,082 --> 00:36:42,343
We're trying to
help. Please, don't.

780
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:43,699
And he's a great catch.

781
00:36:43,768 --> 00:36:45,329
And you don't have the
best track record with men.

782
00:36:45,353 --> 00:36:47,031
No, she doesn't
have any track record.

783
00:36:47,055 --> 00:36:48,933
When I found out you
had a boyfriend, I was like,

784
00:36:48,957 --> 00:36:50,651
"Don't make any
sudden movements."

785
00:36:50,675 --> 00:36:53,726
Oh, my God! Stop talking to me
like no man has ever found me sexy.

786
00:36:53,795 --> 00:36:55,428
Duckie...

787
00:36:55,497 --> 00:36:57,080
And stop calling me Duckie!

788
00:36:58,266 --> 00:37:00,900
I'm not Duckie anymore.

789
00:37:00,969 --> 00:37:05,204
My acne cleared up years ago.
I got rid of my braces in college.

790
00:37:05,273 --> 00:37:08,991
I wear contacts. I use makeup.
I did years of physical therapy

791
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,855
to correct my pigeon toes,
and in case you haven't noticed,

792
00:37:10,879 --> 00:37:13,319
I've learned how
to condition my hair.

793
00:37:13,364 --> 00:37:17,233
I'm not your hopeless,
ugly little sister anymore.

794
00:37:17,302 --> 00:37:19,502
I am not an ugly duckling.

795
00:37:22,391 --> 00:37:23,773
I'm a swan.

796
00:37:25,176 --> 00:37:27,794
And a surgeon. A
freaking kick ass surgeon,

797
00:37:27,862 --> 00:37:30,547
who, by the way,
has had sex before.

798
00:37:30,616 --> 00:37:32,456
Oh, my! Does Daddy know?

799
00:37:32,484 --> 00:37:33,849
You know what?

800
00:37:33,919 --> 00:37:35,829
You're fired as my
bridesmaids, all three of you.

801
00:37:35,853 --> 00:37:37,186
I don't want a single one of you

802
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:38,655
standing up for
me at my wedding.

803
00:37:38,724 --> 00:37:40,924
Honey, don't be silly. You
have to have bridesmaids.

804
00:37:42,094 --> 00:37:43,259
And I will.

805
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:46,429
These are my people now.

806
00:37:48,316 --> 00:37:49,415
Right?

807
00:37:51,086 --> 00:37:52,806
Right. Yes.

808
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:56,355
These are my bridesmaids.

809
00:37:56,424 --> 00:37:58,742
Yeah. Yeah. Yay!

810
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,785
You owe me an apology.

811
00:38:08,854 --> 00:38:10,765
April said you would've
done exactly what I did.

812
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:14,857
Yeah. Yeah, I told April that.

813
00:38:14,926 --> 00:38:17,046
But the truth is that you
messed up this guy's neck,

814
00:38:17,079 --> 00:38:19,312
and I spent eight
hours fixing it yesterday.

815
00:38:19,381 --> 00:38:20,513
So how 'bout "Thank you"?

816
00:38:20,582 --> 00:38:22,093
How 'bout you should've
waited one second

817
00:38:22,117 --> 00:38:23,427
for the surgeon standing
right next to you?

818
00:38:23,451 --> 00:38:25,317
I mean, what was that?

819
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:27,064
You felt like you had to
be the big man out there?

820
00:38:27,088 --> 00:38:29,589
I mean, you feel
threatened by me or...

821
00:38:29,657 --> 00:38:32,392
No, I don't feel
threatened by you.

822
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:34,741
I was trying to
save the guy's life.

823
00:38:34,863 --> 00:38:35,962
Great. So was I.

824
00:38:40,919 --> 00:38:43,147
Okay, I don't have
a problem with you.

825
00:38:43,171 --> 00:38:45,988
I... I don't have a problem
with you either, man.

826
00:38:47,392 --> 00:38:49,003
Hope to see you at the wedding.

827
00:38:49,027 --> 00:38:52,027
Yeah, I, uh, actually don't know
if I'm gonna be able to make it.

828
00:38:53,114 --> 00:38:56,266
Well, I know it would mean
a lot to April if you could.

829
00:38:58,269 --> 00:38:59,502
Since we're good,

830
00:39:00,939 --> 00:39:02,505
you should definitely come.

831
00:39:19,441 --> 00:39:21,801
Before my accident,
you called me a drunk.

832
00:39:24,429 --> 00:39:27,797
I am so sorry.

833
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:31,501
There has not been a day
since that I haven't regretted...

834
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:32,935
You're right.

835
00:39:33,004 --> 00:39:34,704
I am a drunk.

836
00:39:34,773 --> 00:39:37,190
Sir... I'm an alcoholic.

837
00:39:37,259 --> 00:39:40,393
Which is why I'm here
now instead of home.

838
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:44,447
It's boring there, and lonely.

839
00:39:44,516 --> 00:39:47,050
And when I'm bored and
lonely, I wanna have a drink.

840
00:39:47,118 --> 00:39:49,198
Hell, I wanted to have a
drink when I'm happy, too.

841
00:39:50,655 --> 00:39:52,622
I always want a drink,

842
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:55,825
because I have a disease,

843
00:39:57,329 --> 00:39:58,628
and it can't be cured.

844
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:02,765
But it can be managed.

845
00:40:02,833 --> 00:40:04,167
But I can't do it by myself.

846
00:40:05,836 --> 00:40:06,916
I need help.

847
00:40:08,673 --> 00:40:10,833
Accept that you have
a disease, Bailey.

848
00:40:11,576 --> 00:40:12,875
Accept help.

849
00:40:14,679 --> 00:40:17,919
We're all here for you when
you're ready to get started.

850
00:40:40,021 --> 00:40:42,066
<i>Sometimes the key
to making progress</i>

851
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:45,391
<i>is to recognize how to
take that very first step.</i>

852
00:40:47,828 --> 00:40:49,995
<i>Then you start your journey.</i>

853
00:40:50,065 --> 00:40:51,514
That is not what I said at all.

854
00:40:51,583 --> 00:40:52,960
Yeah, well, it's
not what you said.

855
00:40:52,984 --> 00:40:54,695
It's how you said it.
That tone that you...

856
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:55,796
Oh, okay, so now we're gonna

857
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:56,864
fight about how
we fight? This is...

858
00:40:56,888 --> 00:40:58,120
I am sick of this!

859
00:40:58,189 --> 00:41:00,033
I mean, every time we
talk, it turns into this...

860
00:41:00,057 --> 00:41:02,903
Okay, I'm sorry, do you think
that I'm not sick of it, Callie?

861
00:41:02,927 --> 00:41:05,578
'Cause everything I say
seems to piss you off!

862
00:41:05,646 --> 00:41:08,481
Like everything's loaded
and I don't know if it's...

863
00:41:17,959 --> 00:41:19,792
I think talking may
be the problem.

864
00:41:21,963 --> 00:41:23,996
Maybe we shouldn't talk as much.

865
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,800
<i>You hope for the best.</i>

866
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:48,520
<i>And you stick with
it, day in, day out.</i>

867
00:41:49,557 --> 00:41:51,223
<i>Even if you're tired,</i>

868
00:41:51,292 --> 00:41:53,759
<i>even if you wanna
walk away, you don't.</i>

869
00:42:01,252 --> 00:42:03,052
<i>Because you are a pioneer.</i>

870
00:42:07,275 --> 00:42:10,076
Alex, Aaron, get
your asses in the car...

871
00:42:11,429 --> 00:42:14,230
