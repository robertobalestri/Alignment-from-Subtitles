1
00:00:02,303 --> 00:00:03,813
<i>Here's what I learned</i>

2
00:00:03,837 --> 00:00:06,238
<i>my first day at medical school.</i>

3
00:00:06,307 --> 00:00:08,507
<i>Think long and hard before
choosing to become a surgeon.</i>

4
00:00:10,878 --> 00:00:13,345
<i>It takes 100% commitment.</i>

5
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:17,615
This is killing me.

6
00:00:21,588 --> 00:00:23,755
I need coffee.

7
00:00:23,823 --> 00:00:27,559
Four days back to work,
and I'm ready to end it all.

8
00:00:27,627 --> 00:00:30,006
I don't even know how
we survive four days.

9
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,207
Coffee's on!

10
00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:32,364
That's how.

11
00:00:32,433 --> 00:00:33,809
<i>You have to be on your A game</i>

12
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:36,151
<i>every single time
you walk into that OR.</i>

13
00:00:36,237 --> 00:00:38,264
<i>When patients are
lying on your table</i>

14
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:39,721
<i>completely at your mercy,</i>

15
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:43,641
<i>they need to know that
when you make that first cut,</i>

16
00:00:43,711 --> 00:00:44,959
<i>you know what you're doing.</i>

17
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:49,681
<i>No other specialty
requires the time, the focus,</i>

18
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:52,167
<i>the complete dedication,</i>

19
00:00:52,236 --> 00:00:55,320
<i>except, maybe, being a mom.</i>

20
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:58,690
Okay, so Daddy is gonna
drop you off at day care,

21
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:00,404
and I am going to
pick you up, okay?

22
00:01:00,428 --> 00:01:01,638
Then we'll have a
princess tea party

23
00:01:01,662 --> 00:01:03,862
at the end of the day.
Okay, ladies, let's go.

24
00:01:05,182 --> 00:01:06,531
Wow. We're good at this.

25
00:01:07,351 --> 00:01:09,017
Oh, pump!

26
00:01:09,085 --> 00:01:10,802
Yeah. Oh. Okay.

27
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:15,873
Maybe we're too good at this.

28
00:01:18,496 --> 00:01:20,962
James Evans, 57, post-op day 6

29
00:01:21,031 --> 00:01:22,997
from an emergent
tricuspid valve replacement

30
00:01:23,066 --> 00:01:24,399
due to endocarditis.

31
00:01:24,468 --> 00:01:25,878
Hey, could you
change it to Jimmy?

32
00:01:25,902 --> 00:01:27,814
And go ahead and fix
the age, while you're at it,

33
00:01:27,838 --> 00:01:29,671
to something in the 40s.

34
00:01:30,957 --> 00:01:32,085
Deep breath.

35
00:01:32,109 --> 00:01:33,202
Is that thing you put
in there still working?

36
00:01:33,226 --> 00:01:34,359
I think you're good.

37
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:36,128
The new valve should
last 10 to 15 years.

38
00:01:36,196 --> 00:01:38,991
Dr. Wilson's going to do a
treadmill stress echocardiogram

39
00:01:39,015 --> 00:01:40,694
just to be thorough.
Thanks, Doc.

40
00:01:40,718 --> 00:01:42,345
Anything to get
me out of this dress.

41
00:01:42,369 --> 00:01:44,013
Okay.

42
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:49,958
Oh. UNOS has a possible match
on one of my transplant patients.

43
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:51,709
Uh, page me with his results.

44
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:52,811
Okay.

45
00:01:58,218 --> 00:01:59,262
Looking at your dad's chart?

46
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:00,319
He's not my dad.

47
00:02:00,387 --> 00:02:02,554
That's why I took
my mom's last name.

48
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:04,990
So there's nothing
connecting me to the guy.

49
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:06,191
He's funny.

50
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,359
Yeah?

51
00:02:07,427 --> 00:02:09,878
You should talk to him.
Tell him who you are.

52
00:02:09,947 --> 00:02:11,107
Maybe he's changed.
You've changed.

53
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,441
The last time I saw his face,

54
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:15,366
I was punching him so
hard, I could have killed him.

55
00:02:15,435 --> 00:02:18,420
I'm just afraid I'll
pick up where I left off.

56
00:02:21,158 --> 00:02:23,976
Hey! You're doing a
heart/liver on Samantha Calder?

57
00:02:24,044 --> 00:02:25,788
Yep. I saw her
before I went on leave.

58
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:28,480
I'm the one who diagnosed
the familial hypercholesterolemia.

59
00:02:28,548 --> 00:02:29,592
Oh, well, you were right.

60
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:30,682
So let me take the liver.

61
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,596
Really? Yeah, really.

62
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,180
Why didn't you think
of me in the first place?

63
00:02:34,204 --> 00:02:35,965
I guess I thought you
were easing back in?

64
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,089
I don't ease back in. I
jump in the deep end.

65
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,224
I swim.

66
00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:40,370
All right.

67
00:02:40,394 --> 00:02:42,305
Uh, well, have you
read the Cleveland article

68
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:44,997
on simultaneous heart/liver
transplants under CPB?

69
00:02:45,065 --> 00:02:47,305
I have not. Is it different
from a regular heart/liver?

70
00:02:48,586 --> 00:02:49,818
I will read it.

71
00:02:49,887 --> 00:02:51,403
Hey, you're doing a heart/liver?

72
00:02:51,455 --> 00:02:53,216
Yeah. Uh, but I don't need you.

73
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,972
You paged me.

74
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:58,510
You stole my liver?

75
00:02:58,578 --> 00:02:59,744
Uh...

76
00:02:59,813 --> 00:03:01,480
Come on. I deserve this.

77
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:03,693
I've been on the bench for
months. You deserve nothing.

78
00:03:03,717 --> 00:03:05,344
I named my son after you.

79
00:03:05,368 --> 00:03:07,719
You can't be mad at me.

80
00:03:07,788 --> 00:03:09,032
Your son is the devil's spawn.

81
00:03:09,056 --> 00:03:11,005
He drinks the
milk of a liver thief!

82
00:03:13,143 --> 00:03:14,353
Morning, Dr. Kepner.

83
00:03:14,377 --> 00:03:15,922
Dr. Robbins. Mmm. Hi.

84
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:17,924
Coffee? I thought
you could use it

85
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:19,909
before your big surgery
with Dr. Shepherd.

86
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:21,032
Oh.

87
00:03:21,101 --> 00:03:22,884
That's nice.

88
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:28,890
What did I do?

89
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,240
Something nice, apparently.
I didn't get a coffee.

90
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:34,279
No.

91
00:03:34,348 --> 00:03:37,965
No. I think I actually did
something really, really bad.

92
00:03:38,034 --> 00:03:40,118
I think that I brought
her back to my apartment

93
00:03:40,186 --> 00:03:41,286
the night of the gala.

94
00:03:41,355 --> 00:03:42,904
You think?

95
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:44,651
I don't know. I was drunk. I barely
remember even getting home.

96
00:03:44,675 --> 00:03:46,385
And then I have a vague
memory of her in my kitchen.

97
00:03:46,409 --> 00:03:47,959
And now she's
being really friendly.

98
00:03:48,027 --> 00:03:49,347
Did I flirt with her that night?

99
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:52,409
Uh, all I remember is waking up

100
00:03:52,433 --> 00:03:54,194
in my bathtub with
my Spanx still on.

101
00:03:54,218 --> 00:03:55,818
Oh, well, at least
we know you're good.

102
00:03:57,421 --> 00:03:59,354
Oh.

103
00:03:59,423 --> 00:04:02,123
Hey, um, some mortgage
slips for the apartment came.

104
00:04:02,192 --> 00:04:03,858
Oh.

105
00:04:03,927 --> 00:04:05,043
Okay.

106
00:04:05,112 --> 00:04:06,194
You're welcome.

107
00:04:08,616 --> 00:04:10,143
You want me to
thank you for giving me

108
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:11,678
the mortgage slips
to my apartment

109
00:04:11,702 --> 00:04:13,768
that you're living in?

110
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:15,414
Listen, if you want me
to move out, just say so.

111
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:16,783
I don't want to live
in the apartment

112
00:04:16,807 --> 00:04:18,084
that I shared with
my cheating wife.

113
00:04:18,108 --> 00:04:19,707
I gotta go. Thanks!

114
00:04:27,384 --> 00:04:28,528
I think I overslept.

115
00:04:28,552 --> 00:04:29,751
What do you think?

116
00:04:31,088 --> 00:04:32,148
Of?

117
00:04:32,172 --> 00:04:33,805
My shirt? Yes.

118
00:04:33,874 --> 00:04:34,934
You're introducing
me to your mother.

119
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:36,391
I need to make a
good impression,

120
00:04:36,459 --> 00:04:39,961
so I am going for, "Yes, I
am an intern dating your son

121
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:44,115
"who is a fellow and a member
of the board and an Avery.

122
00:04:44,184 --> 00:04:46,151
"But before you write
me off as a gold digger,

123
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:48,453
"you need to know I
am a kick-ass surgeon,

124
00:04:48,522 --> 00:04:50,571
"and your son is
lucky to be dating me."

125
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,435
That is a lot of
pressure to put on a shirt.

126
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:54,025
Oh, it's not working alone.

127
00:04:54,094 --> 00:04:56,144
There's a lip gloss in
my locker that'll assist.

128
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:57,562
Oh, yeah.

129
00:04:57,631 --> 00:04:59,381
Well, she is gonna love you.

130
00:05:01,484 --> 00:05:02,683
Mmm, not here.

131
00:05:02,752 --> 00:05:03,919
What?

132
00:05:03,987 --> 00:05:05,564
Stop. We're not those people.

133
00:05:05,588 --> 00:05:07,055
Oh, I know. Yeah.

134
00:05:09,443 --> 00:05:11,309
Banana bread.

135
00:05:11,378 --> 00:05:12,538
I'm starving.

136
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:14,602
Mmm. Help yourself.

137
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:17,360
I was too busy feeding
my family breakfast

138
00:05:17,384 --> 00:05:19,128
and getting my sister
wife's breast pump packed

139
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:21,097
to feed myself
this morning. So...

140
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:22,937
You have a sister wife?

141
00:05:23,006 --> 00:05:24,734
Derek and Meredith
and I are in a relationship.

142
00:05:24,758 --> 00:05:25,790
Huh.

143
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:27,720
I used to dance in my underwear.

144
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:29,154
And I thought I'd get back
to that when I left Arizona.

145
00:05:29,178 --> 00:05:30,618
Instead I walked
right into <i>Big Love.</i>

146
00:05:31,948 --> 00:05:33,226
I rebounded to the McDreamys.

147
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,050
Mmm.

148
00:05:36,286 --> 00:05:37,997
Hmm, hang glider trauma? Yeah.

149
00:05:38,021 --> 00:05:39,698
Where did you get
this? It's amazing.

150
00:05:39,722 --> 00:05:40,967
It's good, right? Emma made it.

151
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:42,201
Mmm-hmm. Mmm.

152
00:05:42,225 --> 00:05:43,302
Fetal surgeon
Emma from the gala?

153
00:05:43,326 --> 00:05:44,326
Mmm-hmm.

154
00:05:44,394 --> 00:05:47,261
Oh, my God. You're
rebounding, too.

155
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:49,650
Mmm. Yeah.

156
00:05:49,966 --> 00:05:51,099
What have we got?

157
00:05:51,168 --> 00:05:52,278
Her name is Reese Woods, 22.

158
00:05:52,302 --> 00:05:54,019
Hang gliding over
Tiger Mountain,

159
00:05:54,088 --> 00:05:56,087
BP's 100/70,
open tibia fracture,

160
00:05:56,156 --> 00:05:58,039
and complains of abdominal pain.

161
00:05:58,108 --> 00:05:59,708
Can I say, "I told
you so," now, Reese?

162
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,593
Who's this?

163
00:06:01,661 --> 00:06:02,989
Oh, that's Donna.
She's the sister. Mmm.

164
00:06:03,013 --> 00:06:04,741
Although she acts
like she's my mother.

165
00:06:04,765 --> 00:06:06,247
I am not doing this again.

166
00:06:06,316 --> 00:06:08,111
I'm not watching
you try to kill yourself.

167
00:06:08,135 --> 00:06:09,812
It's just a little break.
Don't be so mad.

168
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:11,381
Okay, this isn't
bone. This is a rod.

169
00:06:11,405 --> 00:06:12,854
When did you
have this rod put in?

170
00:06:12,923 --> 00:06:15,607
This March. She broke it
heli-skiing in New Zealand.

171
00:06:15,676 --> 00:06:17,637
She's also broken,
uh, both forearms,

172
00:06:17,661 --> 00:06:19,644
lost a kidney,
dislocated her shoulder.

173
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:21,090
Wow, you really do
have a death wish, huh?

174
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:23,109
I guess I'm just
making up for lost time.

175
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:24,594
I'm seeing a lot of free
fluid in Morrison's pouch.

176
00:06:24,618 --> 00:06:26,978
We're gonna need to
get her up to CT stat.

177
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:31,050
Okay, now show Catherine
your party trick, sir.

178
00:06:36,747 --> 00:06:38,813
Yeah.

179
00:06:38,882 --> 00:06:42,834
Oh! Oh, he's acting all too
cool for school right now.

180
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:45,837
But yesterday, when
he made it to the chair,

181
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:48,523
he was smiling from ear to ear.

182
00:06:48,592 --> 00:06:50,232
Okay, okay. Okay.

183
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,654
Oh!

184
00:06:51,678 --> 00:06:53,027
You are doing so well!

185
00:06:53,096 --> 00:06:55,714
I think you'll be doing
laps by next week.

186
00:06:55,782 --> 00:06:59,212
Excuse me, sir. Your, uh,
drain output has been a little low,

187
00:06:59,236 --> 00:07:02,220
and we were told to
come by to strip your JP.

188
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:04,484
We can come back later
if this isn't a good time.

189
00:07:04,508 --> 00:07:07,375
Well, I actually wanted
to talk with Dr. Bailey.

190
00:07:07,443 --> 00:07:09,763
So right now is a great time.

191
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:15,466
I need a hand to
get back in bed.

192
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:17,029
Well, what are you two
waiting for? Help the man!

193
00:07:17,053 --> 00:07:18,314
Oh, yeah. Of course.

194
00:07:19,555 --> 00:07:20,939
Okay.

195
00:07:24,127 --> 00:07:25,160
I was expecting more.

196
00:07:27,097 --> 00:07:28,691
But he couldn't sit
up two days ago.

197
00:07:28,715 --> 00:07:30,081
He's depressed.

198
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:31,494
Have you considered
antidepressants?

199
00:07:31,518 --> 00:07:32,784
Of course I have.

200
00:07:32,853 --> 00:07:36,015
And he refuses. He
says he's fine, and he is.

201
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:39,390
He needs time,
support, and more pillows

202
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,270
if he's ever gonna be
able to sit up comfortably.

203
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:42,877
I'm gonna go get those.

204
00:07:42,946 --> 00:07:46,047
Miranda, I'm so sorry.

205
00:07:46,116 --> 00:07:49,050
You've done so much,
and I am grateful.

206
00:07:49,119 --> 00:07:51,236
I'm here to help. So let me.

207
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,306
All right, pillows.

208
00:07:58,244 --> 00:07:59,326
Oh, my God!

209
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:00,528
Oh...

210
00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:02,931
Hi.

211
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,667
Jackson, where are your manners?

212
00:08:07,521 --> 00:08:09,361
Mom, this is Stephanie Edwards.

213
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:12,206
Steph, this is my mom.

214
00:08:12,275 --> 00:08:16,410
Dear, would you mind handing
me the pillows from the top bunk?

215
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:24,018
Okay.

216
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:25,353
Mmm.

217
00:08:29,059 --> 00:08:30,603
I don't think she
liked my shirt.

218
00:08:30,627 --> 00:08:32,043
Mmm.

219
00:08:40,754 --> 00:08:42,019
Ma, hold on.

220
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:44,133
You are aware that you're
on the board of this hospital,

221
00:08:44,157 --> 00:08:46,524
as well as an Avery.

222
00:08:46,593 --> 00:08:49,527
You don't know what I went
through to get these pillows.

223
00:08:49,596 --> 00:08:52,758
Meant to lock the door. Good
morning, sir. How are you feeling today?

224
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:54,149
He's a mess.

225
00:08:54,217 --> 00:08:55,983
Who taped this IV?

226
00:08:56,052 --> 00:08:57,318
It's fine.

227
00:08:57,387 --> 00:08:58,620
Maybe it was Edwards.

228
00:08:58,688 --> 00:09:01,072
Her mind's obviously
not on patient care.

229
00:09:01,141 --> 00:09:02,969
That is not fair, Mom. This
is not me being a prude.

230
00:09:02,993 --> 00:09:05,243
I like sex just as much
as the next person.

231
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:06,372
Oh, God, please.

232
00:09:06,396 --> 00:09:07,539
But there is a time
and there's a place.

233
00:09:07,563 --> 00:09:09,041
He said he meant
to lock the door.

234
00:09:09,065 --> 00:09:10,531
You be quiet.

235
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,094
Where are your
compression socks?

236
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:13,596
They went to get another pair.

237
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,365
Maybe they got distracted
by Edwards' breasts.

238
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:16,509
And I'm out.

239
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,607
I'm just looking out for you.

240
00:09:20,593 --> 00:09:22,260
Hey, Sam.

241
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:24,445
Dr. Grey, where's
your baby belly?

242
00:09:24,514 --> 00:09:26,242
It turned into a baby boy.

243
00:09:26,266 --> 00:09:28,633
Congratulations.

244
00:09:28,702 --> 00:09:30,580
I would show you a
picture, but he's so cute,

245
00:09:30,604 --> 00:09:32,749
you may have
another heart attack.

246
00:09:32,773 --> 00:09:34,338
She's had a bunch of them.

247
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,202
Not recently, though. I
think the yoga music helps.

248
00:09:36,226 --> 00:09:37,442
Absolutely.

249
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:38,759
He hates the music.

250
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:39,995
I loved it.

251
00:09:40,063 --> 00:09:41,724
Mmm-hmm. For
the first few months.

252
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:44,816
Well, now that we're getting
you a new heart and liver,

253
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:46,162
you can flip out
like the rest of us.

254
00:09:46,186 --> 00:09:48,586
And have a baby, like Dr. Grey.

255
00:09:48,655 --> 00:09:51,015
Or be a groundbreaking
surgeon, like Dr. Yang.

256
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:53,992
I'm a surgeon, too.

257
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,511
Oh, yeah. Of course.

258
00:09:56,579 --> 00:09:58,045
Dr. Grey does it all.

259
00:09:58,114 --> 00:09:59,547
It's so impressive.

260
00:09:59,616 --> 00:10:01,093
I don't know how
you handle everything.

261
00:10:01,117 --> 00:10:03,251
I don't know either sometimes.

262
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:08,623
What?

263
00:10:08,692 --> 00:10:09,440
Did you want to
examine the patient?

264
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:10,509
Oh.

265
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:16,981
Hello, Mr. Samuels,
I'm Dr. Edwards.

266
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:19,818
It says here you haven't been
able to urinate since yesterday.

267
00:10:19,886 --> 00:10:21,219
Let's take a look.

268
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:23,037
Wow.

269
00:10:23,106 --> 00:10:26,524
Uh, it's no wonder you can't
urinate. Your penis is quite swollen.

270
00:10:26,592 --> 00:10:28,359
I think I got a bug bite.

271
00:10:28,428 --> 00:10:29,861
That's a big bug bite.

272
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:33,665
It's more of a bee
sting than a bug bite.

273
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:35,210
Still pretty swollen
for a bee sting.

274
00:10:35,234 --> 00:10:36,674
Do you have a
history of allergies?

275
00:10:36,703 --> 00:10:38,063
It wasn't really one
bee. It was several.

276
00:10:38,087 --> 00:10:39,504
Well, what's several?

277
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:44,392
I don't know.
Twenty-five? Thirty?

278
00:10:44,461 --> 00:10:45,526
Thirty bees?

279
00:10:45,595 --> 00:10:46,738
I know. It's crazy, right?

280
00:10:46,762 --> 00:10:47,828
Hmm?

281
00:10:47,898 --> 00:10:49,981
But see, it was Saturday, and we

282
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:52,078
have this hammock
in the backyard.

283
00:10:52,102 --> 00:10:56,688
And I thought I'd make some
lunch. So I took my pants off

284
00:10:56,757 --> 00:10:59,423
and made a honey sandwich.

285
00:11:00,894 --> 00:11:02,544
A honey sandwich?

286
00:11:02,612 --> 00:11:03,989
Peanut butter and
honey sandwich.

287
00:11:04,013 --> 00:11:05,591
'Cause who eats a
honey sandwich, right?

288
00:11:05,615 --> 00:11:06,647
Right.

289
00:11:06,716 --> 00:11:08,127
And I was eating
the honey sandwich.

290
00:11:08,151 --> 00:11:11,631
And I fell asleep. And I
guess I got some honey on

291
00:11:12,472 --> 00:11:13,552
myself.

292
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:17,459
And the bees caught the scent.

293
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:21,212
Okay. Mmm-hmm.

294
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,964
Well, I'm gonna get you a dose
of IV Benadryl and a steroid.

295
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:26,618
And then we're gonna get
you a catheter so you can pee.

296
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:27,880
Dr. Edwards.

297
00:11:27,904 --> 00:11:30,471
Would it make a
difference if it were hornets?

298
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:35,321
The patient is a
14-year-old male...

299
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:40,914
All right, one
second. Excuse me.

300
00:11:42,818 --> 00:11:44,658
Fourth day back, and
I'm already scrubbing in

301
00:11:44,721 --> 00:11:46,432
on a heart/liver
transplant with Cristina.

302
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:47,583
Oh, fantastic! Yeah.

303
00:11:47,607 --> 00:11:49,084
Can you pick up the
kids this afternoon?

304
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:51,137
I would, but I have to
entertain all of them.

305
00:11:51,161 --> 00:11:54,073
They're visiting neurosurgeons
watching my AVM Q&A after.

306
00:11:54,097 --> 00:11:55,630
I promised Zola a
princess tea party.

307
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,810
Have Callie do tea.

308
00:11:57,834 --> 00:11:59,683
It was supposed to be
me, or in a pinch, you.

309
00:11:59,753 --> 00:12:01,297
It's so she knows
that she hasn't been

310
00:12:01,321 --> 00:12:02,820
replaced in our hearts

311
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:03,955
by a new baby brother

312
00:12:04,024 --> 00:12:05,624
or by a multi-organ transplant.

313
00:12:05,691 --> 00:12:07,320
It's an over-determined
tea party.

314
00:12:07,344 --> 00:12:09,159
I'll talk to Callie.

315
00:12:15,452 --> 00:12:17,730
I didn't realize I'd have to
work this hard to get out of here.

316
00:12:17,754 --> 00:12:19,220
Five more minutes.

317
00:12:19,289 --> 00:12:21,500
I lost out on three gigs
since I've been in here.

318
00:12:21,524 --> 00:12:23,757
If I can play tonight,
maybe this trip

319
00:12:23,827 --> 00:12:25,443
won't be a total wash.

320
00:12:25,512 --> 00:12:26,822
Do you have any family or anyone

321
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:28,529
I can call to come pick you up?

322
00:12:28,598 --> 00:12:29,798
No, I'm good.

323
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:35,352
How about I make a
call to a rehab clinic?

324
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,822
Don't you worry
about me, darlin'.

325
00:12:37,891 --> 00:12:39,601
I know I had some junk in my
system when I came in here,

326
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:41,170
but I'm a recreational user.

327
00:12:41,194 --> 00:12:42,927
Your left arm, right
arm, and the backs

328
00:12:42,996 --> 00:12:44,690
of both your knees
tell a different story.

329
00:12:44,714 --> 00:12:47,132
It took me half an hour to
find a usable vein on you.

330
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,927
I know what you're gonna
do when you leave here.

331
00:12:48,951 --> 00:12:50,529
I've got people I
can call. I got family.

332
00:12:50,553 --> 00:12:52,904
I don't think you do.
Or maybe you did,

333
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:54,532
but I think that you're
on your own now.

334
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:58,777
Well, you know all
about me, don't you?

335
00:12:58,845 --> 00:13:01,512
I know that we have you
on methadone right now,

336
00:13:01,581 --> 00:13:03,264
which is a big step
towards recovery.

337
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:05,166
Let's just try to keep
it going somewhere.

338
00:13:05,235 --> 00:13:07,835
Kid, I play blues guitar.

339
00:13:07,904 --> 00:13:10,137
I'm not Christina Aguilera.

340
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:12,184
I can't afford those
places, not the good ones.

341
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,275
Let me make some
calls for you, please.

342
00:13:15,745 --> 00:13:18,112
Boy, you are as persistent

343
00:13:18,181 --> 00:13:20,098
as you are annoying.

344
00:13:21,651 --> 00:13:23,518
You can walk as
fast as you want,

345
00:13:23,587 --> 00:13:25,064
but you're not going anywhere.

346
00:13:25,088 --> 00:13:27,188
Neither am I.

347
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:30,719
What is wrong with Callie?
She still hasn't called me back.

348
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:32,409
Ooh! Ooh!

349
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:35,546
Ah, the recovery team texted, two
minutes until they open the donor.

350
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:37,643
Hey, Ross? Could
you run down to the ER

351
00:13:37,667 --> 00:13:39,495
and ask Torres if she
can pick up the kids today?

352
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,163
Sure, but I have to get
this blood to the lab...

353
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:43,232
And remind her about
the princess tea party.

354
00:13:43,256 --> 00:13:45,523
It has to be today.

355
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:47,558
Well, that's pretty cool.

356
00:13:47,627 --> 00:13:49,605
The tea party? Yeah. I mean,
it's just apple juice and cookies,

357
00:13:49,629 --> 00:13:51,111
but she's excited about it.

358
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,396
Not the tea party.

359
00:13:52,465 --> 00:13:54,332
You and me doing
groundbreaking surgery.

360
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,040
That was the idea
when we started.

361
00:13:56,069 --> 00:13:57,935
Yeah. It's pretty cool.

362
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:00,772
Do you need to go pump?

363
00:14:00,823 --> 00:14:01,983
No, I'm fine.

364
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:03,440
You're holding your boobs.

365
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,949
But we're having a moment.
I don't want to spoil it.

366
00:14:05,979 --> 00:14:08,713
Mer, your boobs are
exploding. Go pump.

367
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:10,514
Thank you.

368
00:14:12,485 --> 00:14:14,162
So she might lose the kidney?

369
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:16,231
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
let's not jump ahead.

370
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:19,307
No, please. Worst-case
scenario. I like to be prepared.

371
00:14:19,376 --> 00:14:21,976
Well, the worst-case
scenario is she needs a kidney.

372
00:14:22,044 --> 00:14:23,911
So we start to look for a donor.

373
00:14:26,816 --> 00:14:28,766
Okay. Well, that's me.

374
00:14:28,834 --> 00:14:30,334
I'm her donor.

375
00:14:30,403 --> 00:14:32,265
So you've been
through this before?

376
00:14:32,289 --> 00:14:35,489
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Take your pick.

377
00:14:35,558 --> 00:14:40,211
Bone marrow, blood, uh, liver,
anything you can think of, I've given.

378
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,612
What's mine is hers.

379
00:14:41,681 --> 00:14:44,982
Except I haven't given
a kidney yet. So... Yay!

380
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:48,291
Sounds like she's extremely
accident-prone, even for a daredevil.

381
00:14:48,337 --> 00:14:51,439
No. All the
parachuting and stuff,

382
00:14:51,507 --> 00:14:54,375
it started when she
went into remission.

383
00:14:54,444 --> 00:14:56,711
My sister was diagnosed
with aplastic anemia

384
00:14:56,779 --> 00:14:57,879
when she was two.

385
00:14:57,947 --> 00:14:59,124
Well, that must have been hard.

386
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:00,443
It was lucky that
you were a match.

387
00:15:00,467 --> 00:15:02,233
Oh, it wasn't luck.

388
00:15:02,302 --> 00:15:03,434
I'm a donor baby.

389
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:06,036
You're her younger sister.

390
00:15:06,105 --> 00:15:07,372
Yeah.

391
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,423
My parents only
had me to save her.

392
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:19,150
Ahh!

393
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,953
How did that happen?

394
00:15:22,022 --> 00:15:24,255
It's a long story.

395
00:15:24,324 --> 00:15:25,951
Can you see any access
to get the catheter in?

396
00:15:25,975 --> 00:15:27,608
No, it's too swollen.

397
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:29,827
It looks like it was mauled
by a pissed off badger.

398
00:15:29,895 --> 00:15:31,774
You should have seen it
before the IV Benadryl kicked in.

399
00:15:31,798 --> 00:15:33,715
Ah!

400
00:15:33,783 --> 00:15:36,083
We need to get someone
from urology down here now.

401
00:15:36,152 --> 00:15:38,664
Don't you think I tried?
There's an emergency,

402
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:40,208
and the on-call guy
is 20 minutes away.

403
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:43,869
Dr. Wilson, it feels
like I might explode.

404
00:15:43,893 --> 00:15:45,493
I don't think he's
gonna last 20 minutes.

405
00:15:50,834 --> 00:15:52,010
Dr. Avery, I'm...

406
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:53,612
Darling, save your
breath. There is

407
00:15:53,636 --> 00:15:55,147
nothing you can
say after this morning

408
00:15:55,171 --> 00:15:58,289
to get in my good graces.
I have a giant penis.

409
00:15:58,358 --> 00:16:02,493
No, not me. I don't have a...
I'm a girl. Uh, I have a patient,

410
00:16:02,561 --> 00:16:04,862
and he has a giant penis.

411
00:16:04,931 --> 00:16:08,265
It's the biggest one I've ever
seen, and I've seen a lot of...

412
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:10,694
You make me nervous.
I need a consult.

413
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:14,031
Better go take a look.

414
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:20,294
This rod caused
a lot of bleeding.

415
00:16:20,363 --> 00:16:21,795
We're gonna be here a while.

416
00:16:21,864 --> 00:16:23,342
I hope you don't have plans
with your girlfriend, Hunt.

417
00:16:23,366 --> 00:16:24,710
She's not my girlfriend.

418
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:26,162
She baked you banana bread

419
00:16:26,186 --> 00:16:27,963
and brought it to you at work.
You're practically engaged.

420
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:31,267
Matthew brought me breakfast
burritos, and now we're getting married.

421
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:32,657
Just saying.

422
00:16:33,893 --> 00:16:35,293
Damn it. The
superior pole of this

423
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:36,655
kidney is almost
completely avulsed,

424
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:38,390
and the pedicle is
gonna need some repair.

425
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:40,326
Do you think the sister's
prepared to consider donation?

426
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:41,449
She can't seem to say no.

427
00:16:42,284 --> 00:16:43,628
Dr. Torres? Hmm?

428
00:16:43,652 --> 00:16:45,130
Dr. Grey is going into surgery.

429
00:16:45,154 --> 00:16:46,731
She wants to know if you
can pick up her kids at 3:00.

430
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:49,301
She said to mention promising
Zola a princess tea party?

431
00:16:49,325 --> 00:16:52,259
Tell her I'll be out
of here by 6:00.

432
00:16:54,463 --> 00:16:55,946
So she can't say no.

433
00:16:57,567 --> 00:16:58,749
Oh, my God. You're right.

434
00:16:58,818 --> 00:17:00,217
I need to get a life.

435
00:17:00,286 --> 00:17:01,646
You know what? Maybe
I should kick Arizona out

436
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:02,869
and move back into my place.

437
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:04,383
But she needs the
elevator. And it's

438
00:17:04,407 --> 00:17:05,817
right across the
street from the hospital,

439
00:17:05,841 --> 00:17:07,775
which is perfect for her.

440
00:17:07,843 --> 00:17:10,844
We drank three bottles
of champagne and puked.

441
00:17:10,913 --> 00:17:11,990
It bonds you.

442
00:17:12,014 --> 00:17:13,564
Mmm-hmm.

443
00:17:13,633 --> 00:17:15,143
Plus it's already been retrofitted
to be handicap-accessible.

444
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:16,495
Kepner... I'm shutting up.

445
00:17:16,519 --> 00:17:18,664
No, no. Look at the kidney.
We're gonna need some laps

446
00:17:18,688 --> 00:17:21,583
and a vascular clamp. Kepner,
get the 4-0 Prolene stitch.

447
00:17:25,494 --> 00:17:27,139
Of course, now my mom's
convinced that Stephanie

448
00:17:27,163 --> 00:17:28,740
is some kind of
gold digger, trying to

449
00:17:28,764 --> 00:17:30,392
use sex to nab herself an Avery.

450
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:31,949
Dude, you and your
rich boy problems.

451
00:17:32,018 --> 00:17:33,312
You know what the worst part is?

452
00:17:33,336 --> 00:17:34,596
I think she actually
likes Stephanie.

453
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,632
Well, so then you need
to tell your mom that.

454
00:17:36,656 --> 00:17:37,850
Stand up for your girl.

455
00:17:37,874 --> 00:17:40,369
That wouldn't work. She'd
just hate her even more.

456
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:42,526
So what are you
gonna do? Nothing.

457
00:17:42,595 --> 00:17:44,273
You know, it's like
walking into a hornet's nest.

458
00:17:44,297 --> 00:17:47,626
You know, you gotta stay still,
let the whole frenzy die down.

459
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:48,944
How you doin' with
that coffee, Karev?

460
00:17:48,968 --> 00:17:50,178
You wanna make the damn coffee?

461
00:17:50,202 --> 00:17:52,502
Be my guest. It's a
freakin' crap machine.

462
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:54,930
What's wrong with him?

463
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:56,090
Beats me.

464
00:17:57,426 --> 00:17:58,721
Alex just broke
the coffee machine.

465
00:17:58,745 --> 00:17:59,910
You're dead to me.

466
00:18:01,381 --> 00:18:03,680
Dr. Yang just got a call
from... Oh, God. I'm sorry.

467
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:06,309
Oh, Shane, all my parts are
covered. You can turn around.

468
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:08,130
I'm fine looking at the wall.

469
00:18:08,154 --> 00:18:09,798
Oh! Um, organs are good.

470
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:11,900
Let's go tell Samantha.
She's lactating.

471
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:14,292
I need 10 minutes. I have
four more ounces to go.

472
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,544
Uh, okay. Page me
when you're done.

473
00:18:16,612 --> 00:18:18,307
Oh, Dr. Torres is in surgery.

474
00:18:18,331 --> 00:18:20,847
She can't get the kids
until 6:00 at the earliest.

475
00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:22,816
6:00 is too late
for a tea party.

476
00:18:22,885 --> 00:18:24,168
Tea time is at 4:00.

477
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:25,680
Do you want me to
tell that to Dr. Torres?

478
00:18:25,704 --> 00:18:28,138
No, it's just that I promised.

479
00:18:28,207 --> 00:18:29,767
Just forget it. Forget it.

480
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:34,245
There will be other tea parties.

481
00:18:34,314 --> 00:18:35,579
Well, this is how it starts.

482
00:18:35,648 --> 00:18:37,326
I make a promise. I break it.

483
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:39,662
Ten years later, I'm my mother,

484
00:18:39,686 --> 00:18:41,647
and Zola's snorting
oxy behind the school.

485
00:18:41,671 --> 00:18:42,837
Nice.

486
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:50,544
You know, it goes faster
when you do both sides

487
00:18:50,613 --> 00:18:53,046
at the same time.
How about I quiz you?

488
00:18:54,016 --> 00:18:55,856
I thought you hated me. I do.

489
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:59,470
So hook up the pump
before I change my mind.

490
00:19:01,457 --> 00:19:03,268
Dr. Robbins discovered
the spinal AVM

491
00:19:03,292 --> 00:19:05,492
when the patient was
12. It has since grown.

492
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:08,195
We are going to use a
far lateral retroperitoneal...

493
00:19:08,264 --> 00:19:09,457
Excuse me. Yes.

494
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:11,748
You suggested a
posterior approach?

495
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:13,117
Why go anteriorly?

496
00:19:13,186 --> 00:19:14,852
Did I say that?

497
00:19:14,921 --> 00:19:17,202
Well, I also said the Segway
was gonna hit big, but, uh...

498
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,924
Anyway, that theory
has been elaborated.

499
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:23,577
Excuse me. Sorry. Pardon me.

500
00:19:26,149 --> 00:19:28,082
Who knew Dr. Shepherd
was such a big shot?

501
00:19:28,151 --> 00:19:29,633
What are you doing here?

502
00:19:29,702 --> 00:19:31,201
You told me to scrub in.

503
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,748
The night of the gala?

504
00:19:32,772 --> 00:19:34,137
At your house, remember?

505
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:35,250
Oh, yeah.

506
00:19:35,274 --> 00:19:36,274
That night was so fun.

507
00:19:36,325 --> 00:19:38,108
Yeah.

508
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,344
Don't worry. I won't tell
anyone what happened.

509
00:19:40,413 --> 00:19:42,847
Hey, um, it's a
little tight in here.

510
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:44,292
Uh, you could
probably be more useful

511
00:19:44,316 --> 00:19:46,378
managing patients on the floor.

512
00:19:46,402 --> 00:19:47,968
Oh.

513
00:19:48,036 --> 00:19:49,903
Yeah. You're probably right.

514
00:19:59,015 --> 00:20:04,284
Okay, sweet girl, just one
more. That's it. Shh. Shh, shh.

515
00:20:09,776 --> 00:20:11,509
Stop. Stop what?

516
00:20:11,578 --> 00:20:14,428
Doing that, making
that dog face.

517
00:20:14,497 --> 00:20:17,130
It's puppy dog
eyes, and I'm not.

518
00:20:17,199 --> 00:20:18,833
These are my regular eyes.

519
00:20:18,901 --> 00:20:20,101
What do you want?

520
00:20:20,169 --> 00:20:21,330
Your dad passed his stress test.

521
00:20:21,354 --> 00:20:22,464
Yang told me to discharge him.

522
00:20:22,488 --> 00:20:23,488
Good.

523
00:20:26,009 --> 00:20:27,074
Say it.

524
00:20:28,377 --> 00:20:30,344
I never had a father.

525
00:20:30,413 --> 00:20:33,731
I made up, like,
15 versions of one.

526
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:35,777
A college professor
who would read to me,

527
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:37,178
a plumber who
snuck me into movies.

528
00:20:37,202 --> 00:20:40,338
Like, three doctors,
one who would take me

529
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:42,050
to feed the ducks
in Boston Commons.

530
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:44,642
I want to cry when
I think about it,

531
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:47,711
and I made it up. I
wanted one so badly.

532
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,313
Alex, you have a father.

533
00:20:49,365 --> 00:20:52,332
I know, and he's a dirtbag,
and I didn't make that up.

534
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,486
Just discharge him.

535
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:02,526
Then, uh, he woke up, and
hornets were stinging him.

536
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:04,876
Just on his penis? Accidentally?

537
00:21:05,314 --> 00:21:06,930
Um...

538
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:08,666
Yeah?

539
00:21:08,718 --> 00:21:12,686
Young man, did you put
your penis in a hornet's nest?

540
00:21:14,023 --> 00:21:15,222
No.

541
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:18,125
Maybe.

542
00:21:19,729 --> 00:21:21,345
Yes!

543
00:21:21,414 --> 00:21:23,881
Get another 50 of
fentanyl for the pain.

544
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,727
When there's no
access for a catheter,

545
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:27,751
you need to go
directly into the bladder.

546
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:31,355
Any intern should know that.
Let's just pray we're not too late.

547
00:21:31,424 --> 00:21:32,424
What happens if we are?

548
00:21:32,474 --> 00:21:34,853
Hey, something just happened.

549
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:37,028
I... I feel like I don't
have to pee anymore.

550
00:21:37,563 --> 00:21:39,396
That.

551
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:41,746
The bladder bursts. There's
a moment of relief and then...

552
00:21:44,486 --> 00:21:46,303
Book an OR.

553
00:21:46,372 --> 00:21:47,866
Get Dr. Hunt to
extend me privileges.

554
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:55,546
I am going to the OR.

555
00:21:55,615 --> 00:21:57,359
One of your fine young residents

556
00:21:57,383 --> 00:21:59,077
just let a man's
bladder explode.

557
00:21:59,101 --> 00:22:01,035
Which resident?

558
00:22:01,103 --> 00:22:02,865
The one who was so busy
shaking her tail in front of my son.

559
00:22:02,889 --> 00:22:03,889
Oh, Edwards isn't dumb.

560
00:22:03,956 --> 00:22:05,155
You're right.

561
00:22:05,224 --> 00:22:06,401
She's strategic.
Jackson is dumb.

562
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:07,791
Catherine...

563
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:11,511
I'm going to go and salvage
this patient's manhood.

564
00:22:11,581 --> 00:22:13,013
But when I come back,

565
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:14,459
I want to have a serious
conversation with you

566
00:22:14,483 --> 00:22:17,051
about coming home with me.

567
00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:18,964
Sorry. I came to see
if your drain output

568
00:22:18,988 --> 00:22:21,216
picked up after we stripped it,

569
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,440
but I can come back later.

570
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:25,637
You're not progressing
very quickly here.

571
00:22:25,661 --> 00:22:27,939
They're all in love with
you, and afraid of you.

572
00:22:27,963 --> 00:22:30,798
So they're coddling
you. It's very sweet,

573
00:22:30,867 --> 00:22:34,568
but ultimately a disservice.
You need to push yourself.

574
00:22:34,637 --> 00:22:36,465
You need someone to push you.

575
00:22:36,489 --> 00:22:38,967
This is a long road, and
the slower you go down it,

576
00:22:38,991 --> 00:22:41,925
the poorer your chances are.

577
00:22:41,994 --> 00:22:45,796
I love you, but I
will not coddle you.

578
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:47,448
I never learned how.

579
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:51,217
Come here.

580
00:22:55,991 --> 00:22:58,826
Just think about it. Please?

581
00:23:03,916 --> 00:23:05,377
You're a goddess. I know.

582
00:23:07,103 --> 00:23:08,635
This is Grey. WOMAN: <i>Dr. Grey.</i>

583
00:23:08,704 --> 00:23:10,838
It's Karen at the
day care center.

584
00:23:10,906 --> 00:23:12,706
Zola took a spill off the slide,

585
00:23:12,775 --> 00:23:14,558
and she nicked
the side of her head.

586
00:23:14,626 --> 00:23:16,510
She's probably going
to need a few stitches.

587
00:23:16,579 --> 00:23:18,490
Is she able to stand? Did
she ever lose consciousness?

588
00:23:18,514 --> 00:23:19,608
What happened?

589
00:23:19,632 --> 00:23:20,792
<i>I'm a teacher...</i> She
cut her head open.

590
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:22,493
Well, go. I'll tell Yang. Okay.

591
00:23:22,517 --> 00:23:24,863
So tell Cristina to go ahead
and talk to Samantha without me,

592
00:23:24,887 --> 00:23:26,737
and I will meet her in the OR.

593
00:23:26,806 --> 00:23:29,439
Okay. Poor baby.

594
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:33,077
All right. I got a quick consult
on a Stevens-Johnson syndrome,

595
00:23:33,146 --> 00:23:36,007
and then I'll be right in to
check in on my mother's penis.

596
00:23:36,031 --> 00:23:37,526
I mean, the patient's penis that

597
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:39,211
my mom asked me to consult on.

598
00:23:39,235 --> 00:23:43,153
Why couldn't she have been a
hand specialist or ears or something?

599
00:23:43,221 --> 00:23:44,999
Does it really have to be
you and me and your mom

600
00:23:45,023 --> 00:23:46,590
all staring at a penis?

601
00:23:46,659 --> 00:23:49,805
It is not that loaded for her.
Okay, it's her work. She loves it.

602
00:23:49,829 --> 00:23:51,490
Just ask her questions
and make it medical.

603
00:23:51,514 --> 00:23:53,525
She'll probably forget
about me and you.

604
00:23:53,549 --> 00:23:54,910
Honestly, she
probably already forgot.

605
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:57,534
How nice to see the
two of you together again,

606
00:23:57,603 --> 00:23:59,519
and all dressed this time.

607
00:24:07,412 --> 00:24:10,180
I did it. 'Cause I'm amazing.

608
00:24:10,248 --> 00:24:11,882
Wait. What are you doing?

609
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:13,149
I'm discharged, right?

610
00:24:13,218 --> 00:24:15,430
Oh, no. We're keeping
you here overnight

611
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:18,121
'cause I got you 28
days at Somerville

612
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:20,791
starting tomorrow.
It's a good center.

613
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:22,704
Strong program, great people,

614
00:24:22,728 --> 00:24:24,673
and they said that they
would waive the fees for you.

615
00:24:24,697 --> 00:24:26,162
I appreciate it.

616
00:24:26,231 --> 00:24:27,998
Mmm-hmm.

617
00:24:28,066 --> 00:24:29,745
That's all right.
It's all set up.

618
00:24:29,769 --> 00:24:31,262
And they're gonna
come get you tomorrow.

619
00:24:31,286 --> 00:24:33,753
Why are you doing this?
What is your deal here?

620
00:24:33,822 --> 00:24:35,267
I mean, you pull
your strings for every

621
00:24:35,291 --> 00:24:37,475
itinerate junkie
musician that shows up?

622
00:24:37,543 --> 00:24:39,254
You said that you
would go if I set it up.

623
00:24:39,278 --> 00:24:40,388
You said that you would go...

624
00:24:40,412 --> 00:24:41,628
No, see, I never said that.

625
00:24:41,697 --> 00:24:44,664
That's against my policy.
That's how you screw up.

626
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:46,244
You tell someone you're
gonna do something,

627
00:24:46,268 --> 00:24:48,435
you set 'em up
for disappointment.

628
00:24:49,871 --> 00:24:52,672
That's how you lose
your home, your family.

629
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:54,758
Make your children hate you.

630
00:24:54,827 --> 00:24:58,612
Look, you're a sweet kid,
and I don't even know you.

631
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:01,715
But I don't want to let
you down, too. All right?

632
00:25:04,069 --> 00:25:05,413
'Cause you'd never let me

633
00:25:05,437 --> 00:25:06,957
hear the end of
it, you damn nag.

634
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:11,842
Jimmy, if you keep going
the way that you are going...

635
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:13,877
I appreciate your concern.

636
00:25:15,414 --> 00:25:16,997
More than I can say.

637
00:25:19,734 --> 00:25:21,168
Just take care now.

638
00:25:31,497 --> 00:25:32,640
You can help.

639
00:25:32,664 --> 00:25:33,664
Oh, my God.

640
00:25:33,733 --> 00:25:35,443
He's leaving, and
he's miserable,

641
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:37,061
and he's full of
regret about you.

642
00:25:37,085 --> 00:25:39,397
And you're angry. And
you've always been angry.

643
00:25:39,421 --> 00:25:41,316
And I think this
could help you, too.

644
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:42,918
And I think it's
your last chance

645
00:25:42,942 --> 00:25:44,452
because he's gonna
go and use again,

646
00:25:44,476 --> 00:25:46,010
and he's gonna die.

647
00:25:46,078 --> 00:25:47,572
Look, don't talk to
me about this again.

648
00:25:47,596 --> 00:25:49,663
All right? Ever.

649
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:57,715
Oh, how's Zola?

650
00:25:57,739 --> 00:25:58,938
Oh, she'll be fine.

651
00:25:59,008 --> 00:26:01,141
Once Grey gets down
there, she'll stitch her up,

652
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:02,490
and be back in time to scrub in.

653
00:26:03,945 --> 00:26:06,263
It's happening again!

654
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,600
Oh, she's desatting.

655
00:26:09,668 --> 00:26:11,301
Uh, I'm gonna intubate.

656
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:13,782
Push 5 of Versed and
100 of succinylcholine.

657
00:26:13,806 --> 00:26:15,105
What happened?

658
00:26:15,174 --> 00:26:16,484
She's gone into
heart failure again.

659
00:26:16,508 --> 00:26:17,953
Check on the organs
and book an OR.

660
00:26:17,977 --> 00:26:19,977
We're bringing her down
as soon as she's intubated.

661
00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:33,156
Okay, got that closed up.

662
00:26:33,225 --> 00:26:36,209
Now let me see. Did
I miss anything else?

663
00:26:36,996 --> 00:26:39,063
I don't see anything.

664
00:26:39,131 --> 00:26:42,716
That's what's called a
rhetorical question, my dear.

665
00:26:42,802 --> 00:26:45,652
All right, let's take a look
at this penis, shall we?

666
00:26:45,721 --> 00:26:47,387
Mmm.

667
00:26:48,707 --> 00:26:50,874
Uh, Dr. Avery, can
you elaborate on

668
00:26:50,943 --> 00:26:53,059
some of your more
interesting cases?

669
00:26:53,128 --> 00:26:55,362
I'm fascinated by
all things penile.

670
00:26:55,431 --> 00:26:58,381
Yes, I saw evidence of
that earlier this morning.

671
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,851
How's it looking, dear?

672
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:03,098
Well, it's possible he's
gonna need a skin graft,

673
00:27:03,122 --> 00:27:04,866
- but nothing I can't fix.
- Mmm.

674
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:06,901
Yeah, he'll be able to
stick it in a hornet's nest,

675
00:27:06,925 --> 00:27:09,760
an ant hill, a tarantula's...
Wherever they live.

676
00:27:09,829 --> 00:27:12,613
Well, I find that men
often put their penises

677
00:27:12,681 --> 00:27:14,676
in places that
they don't belong.

678
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,894
Mmm-hmm.

679
00:27:16,918 --> 00:27:18,518
Suction, dear, come on.

680
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:26,359
Okay, Supergirl. That's
the only ouch-y part.

681
00:27:26,429 --> 00:27:28,595
Now you're not gonna
feel anything at all.

682
00:27:28,664 --> 00:27:29,996
You are so brave.

683
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:32,346
I'm so proud of you.

684
00:27:33,635 --> 00:27:35,380
My patient's going into the OR.

685
00:27:35,404 --> 00:27:36,754
When? Right now.

686
00:27:36,822 --> 00:27:38,834
It wasn't supposed to be
for another hour at least.

687
00:27:38,858 --> 00:27:41,492
Well, go ahead. Uh, I'll have
Jenna come in and hold her.

688
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,727
Doesn't that sound a
little Ellis Grey to you?

689
00:27:43,796 --> 00:27:46,457
To leave my kid to go to surgery
while she's getting stitches?

690
00:27:46,481 --> 00:27:49,049
You're a good mom, Mer. Take
it from me. I had crap parents.

691
00:27:49,118 --> 00:27:51,518
I know the difference. Besides,
she's not gonna be alone.

692
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:54,186
She's gonna be with me, who she
loves more than her own parents.

693
00:27:58,577 --> 00:27:59,821
I can't believe I'm doing this.

694
00:27:59,845 --> 00:28:01,895
Yeah. Can you
send Jenna in here?

695
00:28:01,964 --> 00:28:03,164
Look, don't cry, or she will.

696
00:28:06,568 --> 00:28:08,385
The general surgeons
weren't able to

697
00:28:08,454 --> 00:28:10,170
repair your
sister's kidney, so...

698
00:28:10,239 --> 00:28:12,016
We're gonna... Let's
just cut to the chase.

699
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,280
Eventually, she's
going to need a kidney.

700
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:16,060
Right?

701
00:28:19,715 --> 00:28:20,955
Okay.

702
00:28:21,817 --> 00:28:24,218
Well, here I am.

703
00:28:24,286 --> 00:28:27,320
Open the toolbox. Take
whatever she needs.

704
00:28:29,425 --> 00:28:32,693
Hey, look, this doesn't
have to happen right now.

705
00:28:32,761 --> 00:28:35,812
Okay, she'll be on dialysis
until we find a donor.

706
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:40,284
You don't need to be spare
parts for your sister anymore.

707
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:44,962
Here's what I need.

708
00:28:47,343 --> 00:28:51,044
I need a boyfriend and a job.

709
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:54,648
And a Caribbean cruise.

710
00:28:56,035 --> 00:28:57,846
And I would like to
learn to ride a bike,

711
00:28:57,870 --> 00:29:00,531
because I never learned
to ride one when I was little.

712
00:29:00,555 --> 00:29:04,057
I couldn't get injured 'cause
Reese might need some body part.

713
00:29:04,125 --> 00:29:08,595
And I'd love to not be spare
parts for my sister anymore,

714
00:29:08,664 --> 00:29:10,063
but can I do that?

715
00:29:10,131 --> 00:29:11,365
Can I say no?

716
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:14,651
Yes, you can say
no. It's your life.

717
00:29:14,719 --> 00:29:17,220
You know, you
should ride that bike.

718
00:29:17,289 --> 00:29:20,023
Go on that cruise.
Get a boyfriend.

719
00:29:20,092 --> 00:29:21,624
Dance in your underwear.

720
00:29:23,162 --> 00:29:25,045
Yeah, you can say no.

721
00:29:25,113 --> 00:29:27,273
I can say no. Yeah,
it feels good, right?

722
00:29:28,184 --> 00:29:29,565
I can say no!

723
00:29:29,634 --> 00:29:31,001
You can say no!

724
00:29:31,053 --> 00:29:32,068
No! No! No!

725
00:29:32,137 --> 00:29:33,137
No! No! No!

726
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:34,420
No!

727
00:29:41,213 --> 00:29:44,447
Oh, sweetie.

728
00:29:44,516 --> 00:29:47,596
I'm his wife. I was out
of town. What happened?

729
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:52,889
Well, he came in with quite a
few stings in his groin area. And...

730
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:55,459
Oh, no. He didn't.

731
00:29:55,527 --> 00:29:58,094
He stuck his penis in that
hornet's nest, didn't he?

732
00:29:59,764 --> 00:30:01,331
You knew?

733
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:02,649
How?

734
00:30:02,718 --> 00:30:04,028
I saw a nest on
the eaves as I left.

735
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:06,113
I knew I should
have had it removed.

736
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:08,688
So this is something
he's done before?

737
00:30:09,824 --> 00:30:11,924
He's someone who

738
00:30:11,993 --> 00:30:15,095
likes a little pain
with his pleasure.

739
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:17,347
Any kind of sting, really.

740
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:19,249
Bee, ant.

741
00:30:20,286 --> 00:30:22,186
I'm sure he was ashamed.

742
00:30:22,254 --> 00:30:24,771
That's why it took
him so long to come in.

743
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:27,791
I don't understand it either.

744
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:33,197
But it's just one thing. There
are 500 things about him

745
00:30:33,265 --> 00:30:35,705
that are so much
more interesting.

746
00:30:36,718 --> 00:30:38,268
That is not possible.

747
00:30:43,575 --> 00:30:44,791
Whew! I'm here.

748
00:30:46,161 --> 00:30:47,494
What's she doing here?

749
00:30:47,563 --> 00:30:48,979
She's doing the liver.

750
00:30:49,048 --> 00:30:50,680
I'm doing the liver.

751
00:30:50,749 --> 00:30:53,094
She needed two staples. I actually
left her in the hands of Jenna.

752
00:30:53,118 --> 00:30:55,096
That nurse that... I
don't care about Zola.

753
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,397
I'm thinking about the patient.

754
00:30:56,421 --> 00:30:57,649
Whoa, dial it back for a second.

755
00:30:57,673 --> 00:30:58,867
Does she have a concussion?

756
00:30:58,891 --> 00:31:01,174
No, she's fine. Are you?

757
00:31:01,242 --> 00:31:03,722
You're gonna be worried
about that and 100 other things

758
00:31:03,746 --> 00:31:05,757
besides my patient and my liver.

759
00:31:05,781 --> 00:31:09,015
She is my patient, and
she was my patient before...

760
00:31:09,084 --> 00:31:10,795
Did you finish reading
the article on performing

761
00:31:10,819 --> 00:31:13,179
simultaneous transplants
completely under CPB?

762
00:31:16,608 --> 00:31:18,519
Dr. Bailey knows the procedure.

763
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:20,463
Dr. Bailey is scrubbing
in on my patient.

764
00:31:25,099 --> 00:31:26,199
Sorry.

765
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:37,360
Probably should have
checked back earlier.

766
00:31:37,429 --> 00:31:41,131
Your white blood
cell count is elevated.

767
00:31:41,199 --> 00:31:42,560
I'd like to start
you on antibiotics.

768
00:31:42,584 --> 00:31:44,518
Why do I need antibiotics?

769
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,287
Because there's a left shift?

770
00:31:47,356 --> 00:31:51,975
You need to examine me to find
out what's causing the elevation.

771
00:31:56,214 --> 00:31:57,530
Murphy.

772
00:31:57,599 --> 00:31:59,510
I don't want to be coddled
or pussyfooted around.

773
00:31:59,534 --> 00:32:01,918
No offense. It makes
you a bad doctor

774
00:32:01,987 --> 00:32:04,254
and me a sicker
patient. So buck up,

775
00:32:04,323 --> 00:32:08,125
lift my gown and give me
a proper hands-on exam.

776
00:32:08,677 --> 00:32:10,043
Yes, sir.

777
00:32:18,653 --> 00:32:20,336
It feels distended.

778
00:32:20,405 --> 00:32:22,438
Okay, what does that tell you?

779
00:32:22,507 --> 00:32:23,684
There could be fluid buildup.

780
00:32:23,708 --> 00:32:24,775
Okay.

781
00:32:24,843 --> 00:32:26,209
You're checking the drain?

782
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:27,928
There's no output.

783
00:32:27,996 --> 00:32:30,197
Okay, what else?

784
00:32:30,265 --> 00:32:33,800
You have epigastric
tenderness, increased WBC,

785
00:32:33,869 --> 00:32:37,904
and little to no drain output,
which means you have a

786
00:32:37,972 --> 00:32:39,050
symptomatic pancreatic leak.

787
00:32:39,074 --> 00:32:40,206
Okay.

788
00:32:40,275 --> 00:32:42,036
Which also means I'm
in a great deal of pain.

789
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:44,010
Now you need to try
and unclog the drain

790
00:32:44,079 --> 00:32:46,239
with a Fogarty catheter so
this doesn't happen again!

791
00:32:47,148 --> 00:32:48,181
God.

792
00:32:51,236 --> 00:32:53,703
There's the bossy
Richard I know and love.

793
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:57,958
They're gonna learn
how to look me in the eye

794
00:32:58,026 --> 00:33:00,627
and explain to me what
they're doing so I understand.

795
00:33:00,712 --> 00:33:03,412
When I ask a question,
they're going to answer it.

796
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:06,115
They're gonna figure out why
my pancreas still requires a drain.

797
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:10,853
So take it you're not
coming home with me.

798
00:33:13,575 --> 00:33:15,091
These fools need me, Catherine.

799
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,360
Well, what if I need you, too?

800
00:33:18,947 --> 00:33:20,029
Come here.

801
00:33:27,072 --> 00:33:29,706
You got me.

802
00:33:29,774 --> 00:33:31,958
I'm right here.

803
00:33:32,026 --> 00:33:33,593
Hey, going back to the tribe?

804
00:33:33,662 --> 00:33:35,473
After I grab Sofia.
How about you?

805
00:33:35,497 --> 00:33:37,208
Seeing your not-girlfriend?

806
00:33:37,232 --> 00:33:40,466
That was the plan, but I'm going
to talk to the hang glider's sister.

807
00:33:40,535 --> 00:33:42,903
She decided to
donate a kidney after all.

808
00:34:14,352 --> 00:34:15,452
Take it easy, pal.

809
00:34:20,175 --> 00:34:21,340
How'd it go?

810
00:34:24,462 --> 00:34:25,929
Her initial labs look good.

811
00:34:25,998 --> 00:34:28,609
She's, uh, headed down to
the cardiac ICU. If you want...

812
00:34:28,633 --> 00:34:30,233
You stole that surgery from me.

813
00:34:32,037 --> 00:34:33,536
I'm sorry.

814
00:34:33,605 --> 00:34:35,783
I really wish you could
have been in there with me.

815
00:34:35,807 --> 00:34:38,558
I worked my ass off to
do that surgery with you,

816
00:34:38,627 --> 00:34:40,610
and you stole it from
me. That was low...

817
00:34:40,678 --> 00:34:42,340
Meredith, you were unprepared,

818
00:34:42,364 --> 00:34:44,542
you were unfocused,
and you were late.

819
00:34:44,566 --> 00:34:46,311
I didn't steal that
surgery from you.

820
00:34:46,335 --> 00:34:47,978
I rescued that surgery from you.

821
00:34:48,002 --> 00:34:49,613
Oh, I... Because
you couldn't do it.

822
00:34:49,637 --> 00:34:51,983
I understand that you believe
you are God's gift to medicine,

823
00:34:52,007 --> 00:34:55,825
but I am every bit as talented and
competent a surgeon as you are.

824
00:34:55,894 --> 00:34:57,210
No, you're not.

825
00:35:00,114 --> 00:35:02,048
I'm sorry.

826
00:35:02,116 --> 00:35:03,916
But you're not.

827
00:35:03,985 --> 00:35:06,018
And that's...

828
00:35:06,087 --> 00:35:07,253
That's okay.

829
00:35:07,322 --> 00:35:09,033
You have different
priorities now.

830
00:35:09,057 --> 00:35:10,735
You cut back on
your clinical hours,

831
00:35:10,759 --> 00:35:12,420
you log in less time in the OR.

832
00:35:12,444 --> 00:35:15,412
I mean, you don't do
research, and I get it.

833
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:19,649
I mean, you have Zola and baby
Bailey and you want to be a good mom.

834
00:35:19,701 --> 00:35:21,485
I don't believe you.

835
00:35:21,553 --> 00:35:24,454
You are saying that I can't
be a good surgeon and a mom.

836
00:35:24,522 --> 00:35:26,367
Of course not. Bailey is a mom,

837
00:35:26,391 --> 00:35:28,185
and she was
fantastic in there today.

838
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:30,038
Then what are you
saying? I'm saying...

839
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:35,265
Okay. Bailey never let up.

840
00:35:35,334 --> 00:35:36,833
Okay, she, like, lives here.

841
00:35:36,901 --> 00:35:38,668
Callie never let up.

842
00:35:38,736 --> 00:35:41,120
Ellis Grey never let up.

843
00:35:41,189 --> 00:35:44,107
And I know you don't
want to be your mother.

844
00:35:44,176 --> 00:35:45,416
I'm saying...

845
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:48,912
I'm saying

846
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:51,826
you and I started running down
the same road at the same time,

847
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:54,700
and at a certain
point you let up.

848
00:35:54,770 --> 00:35:56,403
You slowed down.

849
00:35:56,471 --> 00:35:58,949
And don't say that I don't
support that, because I do.

850
00:35:58,973 --> 00:36:01,741
You made your choices,
and they are valid choices.

851
00:36:01,809 --> 00:36:05,044
But don't pretend they
don't affect your skills.

852
00:36:05,113 --> 00:36:08,832
You are a very
good surgeon. It's...

853
00:36:10,885 --> 00:36:13,085
We're in different places now.

854
00:36:13,205 --> 00:36:15,137
And that's okay.

855
00:36:24,716 --> 00:36:27,650
I mean, they were huge.
They were hard to hold.

856
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:29,759
Yeah? Yeah, they
kind of hooked like that.

857
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:31,399
You see those people
down there? Mmm-hmm.

858
00:36:31,423 --> 00:36:33,334
Those are the top 12
neurosurgeons in the world,

859
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:35,078
and they need a
drink. You got it.

860
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:40,647
Hey.

861
00:36:40,715 --> 00:36:43,249
I am going to need
my place back.

862
00:36:43,318 --> 00:36:44,662
Look, I feel bad
about kicking you out,

863
00:36:44,686 --> 00:36:47,120
but I need to stop taking
care of other people.

864
00:36:47,189 --> 00:36:49,822
I took care of you for a year.

865
00:36:49,891 --> 00:36:52,058
I picked you up off
the bathroom floor.

866
00:36:52,127 --> 00:36:54,493
I took your abuse.

867
00:36:54,562 --> 00:36:56,462
But you're not sick anymore.

868
00:36:56,531 --> 00:36:59,732
Now you're just someone who
cheated, and you did that to yourself.

869
00:36:59,801 --> 00:37:01,600
So, I'm sorry, but I
need my life back.

870
00:37:01,669 --> 00:37:03,936
I need me back, and
I need to do it tonight,

871
00:37:04,005 --> 00:37:06,972
or I'm afraid I'll
change my mind.

872
00:37:07,041 --> 00:37:08,586
So, I will have an
intern pack up your stuff

873
00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:10,170
and bring it to the
hospital tomorrow.

874
00:37:15,099 --> 00:37:17,579
You can stay at my place.

875
00:37:21,523 --> 00:37:24,056
Okay, you know what?
Okay. Just tell me,

876
00:37:24,125 --> 00:37:25,603
what did I do? What did we do?

877
00:37:25,627 --> 00:37:28,394
'Cause clearly something
happened after the gala,

878
00:37:28,463 --> 00:37:31,481
and whatever it was,
I'm sorry, I don't...

879
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:33,733
Oh, my God.

880
00:37:33,802 --> 00:37:35,062
I can't believe you
don't remember.

881
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:38,554
Well, I was drunk,
and you're pretty...

882
00:37:38,623 --> 00:37:39,701
We hung out.

883
00:37:39,725 --> 00:37:41,290
Oh.

884
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:43,637
After I put you in the cab, I called to
see if you and Kepner made it home

885
00:37:43,661 --> 00:37:45,706
and you didn't answer,
so I went to check.

886
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:46,840
And good thing, because you were

887
00:37:46,864 --> 00:37:47,892
passed out on the hallway floor.

888
00:37:47,916 --> 00:37:48,981
Oh.

889
00:37:49,051 --> 00:37:50,361
I helped you inside.

890
00:37:50,385 --> 00:37:52,696
And you insisted on
having a dance party.

891
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:55,672
We made the most amazing
grilled cheese sandwiches

892
00:37:55,741 --> 00:37:57,952
and ate them while
we watched the films

893
00:37:57,976 --> 00:38:00,777
of Dr. Shepherd
doing the spinal AVM,

894
00:38:00,845 --> 00:38:02,085
which he did today,

895
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:04,197
which is when you
asked me to be there.

896
00:38:05,299 --> 00:38:06,999
Oh.

897
00:38:07,068 --> 00:38:09,062
It was the first
time I felt like

898
00:38:09,086 --> 00:38:11,271
I found someone
around here who got me.

899
00:38:13,574 --> 00:38:15,974
Do you really not
remember any of it?

900
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:18,361
I vaguely remember
the grilled cheese.

901
00:38:22,684 --> 00:38:25,385
Let's go back to the part
where you said I was pretty.

902
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,456
That part?

903
00:38:42,787 --> 00:38:44,871
Excuse me, Dr. Avery.
Do you have a minute?

904
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:48,641
I'm meeting my son,
Edwards. It's been a long day.

905
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:51,544
I just think that we probably
got off on the wrong foot.

906
00:38:51,613 --> 00:38:53,524
Your feet were
not the issue, dear.

907
00:38:53,548 --> 00:38:54,681
I know how it looked.

908
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:55,893
I'm quite sure you don't.

909
00:38:55,917 --> 00:38:57,327
No, I really do. I
was having a quickie

910
00:38:57,351 --> 00:38:58,968
with your son in
the on-call room.

911
00:38:59,037 --> 00:39:01,538
And it suggests I
have no self-respect.

912
00:39:01,606 --> 00:39:05,041
It suggests that I, like
much of my generation,

913
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:07,377
don't understand that
where we choose to have sex

914
00:39:07,445 --> 00:39:09,140
says a lot about what
we think of ourselves.

915
00:39:09,164 --> 00:39:11,597
And a lot of the work you
did to break down barriers

916
00:39:11,666 --> 00:39:13,666
for women, and in
particular, women of color,

917
00:39:13,735 --> 00:39:15,095
was a whole lot
of wasted effort.

918
00:39:16,421 --> 00:39:17,687
Mmm.

919
00:39:19,574 --> 00:39:23,876
I picked a shirt to wear today
because I knew I'd be meeting you.

920
00:39:23,945 --> 00:39:25,929
A really respectable one.

921
00:39:25,997 --> 00:39:30,433
Meeting Jackson's mother
meant something to me.

922
00:39:30,501 --> 00:39:33,102
I care about him.

923
00:39:33,171 --> 00:39:34,949
And the shirt coming
off in the on-call room,

924
00:39:34,973 --> 00:39:38,174
that was really, like, a joke about
people who have sex in on-call rooms.

925
00:39:38,243 --> 00:39:40,910
And that's the only thing
you're gonna think of

926
00:39:40,978 --> 00:39:43,145
when you think of me now.

927
00:39:43,215 --> 00:39:45,147
There are 500 other
things about me

928
00:39:45,217 --> 00:39:47,833
that are so much more
interesting than that.

929
00:39:47,902 --> 00:39:49,547
Well, I will also
think about the fact

930
00:39:49,571 --> 00:39:51,115
that you didn't
put in a catheter

931
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:52,855
until the man's bladder... Okay.

932
00:39:52,924 --> 00:39:54,836
In all fairness, I wasn't
getting all the information

933
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:56,804
I needed to diagnose.
When in doubt,

934
00:39:56,828 --> 00:40:00,713
assume they put it someplace
unimaginable and move on.

935
00:40:03,919 --> 00:40:06,719
Oh, hey, um, I was just leaving.

936
00:40:06,788 --> 00:40:09,088
Well, what's your
hurry? I'm buying.

937
00:40:17,515 --> 00:40:18,531
So...

938
00:40:21,486 --> 00:40:22,518
Sleep tight.

939
00:40:25,323 --> 00:40:28,057
<i>What if your focus splits?</i>

940
00:40:28,126 --> 00:40:30,542
<i>What if you can't be all in?</i>

941
00:40:33,748 --> 00:40:36,148
<i>Are you left with
nothing at all?</i>

942
00:40:51,666 --> 00:40:54,500
<i>Maybe you just need
to find a different path.</i>

943
00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:05,945
Hey! How's Zola?

944
00:41:06,013 --> 00:41:07,893
Karev filled me in. Said
she was a real champ.

945
00:41:10,936 --> 00:41:12,985
She didn't get her
princess tea party.

946
00:41:14,355 --> 00:41:15,632
Wait. I thought Callie
was gonna do that.

947
00:41:15,656 --> 00:41:17,273
Callie has moved out,

948
00:41:17,342 --> 00:41:18,920
and she was
supposed to do the food

949
00:41:18,944 --> 00:41:20,487
shopping. So now
there's no food.

950
00:41:20,511 --> 00:41:22,023
Zola has two
stitches in her head

951
00:41:22,047 --> 00:41:24,358
and had cereal for dinner,
and the house is a mess

952
00:41:24,382 --> 00:41:25,993
because I couldn't
get the baby to sleep.

953
00:41:26,017 --> 00:41:27,878
And she didn't get
her princess tea party.

954
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:29,902
Why are you yelling at
me? I had a big surgery.

955
00:41:29,971 --> 00:41:31,554
So did I!

956
00:41:31,623 --> 00:41:33,100
But you didn't
answer your phone.

957
00:41:33,124 --> 00:41:35,686
She cut her head, and you
didn't answer your phone.

958
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:37,750
So I had to go comfort
her, which means that

959
00:41:37,812 --> 00:41:40,093
I didn't get to do my surgery.

960
00:41:40,148 --> 00:41:43,583
A heart/liver transplant.
Those never happen,

961
00:41:43,651 --> 00:41:45,651
and I didn't get to do it.

962
00:41:45,737 --> 00:41:47,081
I'm sorry, but
that is not my fault.

963
00:41:47,105 --> 00:41:48,345
It is your fault

964
00:41:48,406 --> 00:41:49,599
because you didn't
answer your phone!

965
00:41:49,623 --> 00:41:50,806
I was in a surgery.

966
00:41:50,875 --> 00:41:53,187
I shouldn't have to choose
between being a good mother

967
00:41:53,211 --> 00:41:54,493
and being a good surgeon.

968
00:41:54,562 --> 00:41:55,828
I never asked you to do that.

969
00:41:55,897 --> 00:41:57,313
Never have I
asked you to do that.

970
00:41:57,382 --> 00:41:59,816
<i>Here's what's horrifying.</i>

971
00:41:59,885 --> 00:42:01,334
<i>What if you can't give 100%?</i>

972
00:42:03,721 --> 00:42:07,256
<i>Maybe you just need to
go back to the beginning.</i>

973
00:42:07,325 --> 00:42:09,075
<i>And start all over again.</i>
