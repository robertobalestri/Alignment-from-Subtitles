1
00:00:06,857 --> 00:00:07,923
Oh!

2
00:00:07,992 --> 00:00:10,032
Let's see if maybe...

3
00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:12,339
Oh!

4
00:00:12,363 --> 00:00:13,529
Crap.

5
00:00:13,597 --> 00:00:15,425
<i>Doctors never mean to screw up.</i>

6
00:00:15,449 --> 00:00:17,009
Crap, crap, crap. Crap!

7
00:00:17,033 --> 00:00:18,177
Are you sure you don't
want me to call for...

8
00:00:18,201 --> 00:00:19,784
No. There's no time.

9
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:23,404
<i>You make a bad call, and
the unthinkable happens.</i>

10
00:00:23,473 --> 00:00:25,808
Can I help you? Uh...

11
00:00:25,876 --> 00:00:28,221
Yeah, don't you have any
just, um, regular panty hose?

12
00:00:28,245 --> 00:00:30,257
We can't do that.
We have to. Lap pads!

13
00:00:30,281 --> 00:00:32,259
But we still haven't... I don't
care! We're closing him up.

14
00:00:32,283 --> 00:00:34,916
Zero Vicryl. Zero Vicryl, now.

15
00:00:34,985 --> 00:00:36,997
Am I not being clear? Why
do you look so confused?

16
00:00:37,021 --> 00:00:39,099
What about these? They're
popular. They shimmer.

17
00:00:39,123 --> 00:00:40,722
No. No, no shimmer.

18
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:43,592
No footless tights or
freaky little toe sock thingies.

19
00:00:43,661 --> 00:00:45,727
I just want panty
hose, basic nude.

20
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:47,457
I used to buy them
at the grocery store.

21
00:00:47,481 --> 00:00:49,743
They come in a little plastic
egg kind of panty hose!

22
00:00:49,767 --> 00:00:52,701
That's what I need! Is that
really so hard to understand?

23
00:00:52,786 --> 00:00:54,698
<i>It's not like we
do it on purpose.</i>

24
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:56,533
<i>It's not like we
want to hurt anyone.</i>

25
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:59,791
<i>But sometimes we do.
Sometimes we make mistakes.</i>

26
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:00,892
I'm...

27
00:01:00,961 --> 00:01:02,694
I'm sorry.

28
00:01:02,763 --> 00:01:05,096
<i>And when we
blow it, we're sorry.</i>

29
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:06,664
<i>That was inappropriate.</i>

30
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:08,633
I'm... I'm just...

31
00:01:08,702 --> 00:01:10,342
I'm under a lot of
pressure right now,

32
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:11,937
and I have a really
big day tomorrow.

33
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:13,671
You know what? That's fine.

34
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,469
These are fine. These are great.

35
00:01:15,493 --> 00:01:18,877
Actually, I'll take all these.
I'm gonna take 'em all.

36
00:01:18,945 --> 00:01:20,990
Really? Yeah.
Just, uh, ring me up.

37
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:22,675
Even these, the ones
with the rhinestones?

38
00:01:22,699 --> 00:01:24,010
Even those. Okay.

39
00:01:24,034 --> 00:01:26,084
<i>Not that being
sorry really matters.</i>

40
00:01:26,153 --> 00:01:27,286
<i>Not anymore.</i>

41
00:01:28,339 --> 00:01:31,439
<i>No apology in the
world matters now.</i>

42
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:34,776
Brain mapping is not
an exact science yet.

43
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:37,095
But this array brings
us one step closer.

44
00:01:37,164 --> 00:01:39,948
Dr. Torres and I have had
tremendous success so far,

45
00:01:40,017 --> 00:01:41,650
and because of that,

46
00:01:41,719 --> 00:01:44,548
we are moving from an
animated hand to a robotic one.

47
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:46,854
Oh, she's on the stage.

48
00:01:46,923 --> 00:01:48,390
I'm sorry, sir. Are you lost?

49
00:01:48,475 --> 00:01:51,076
Sorry. I'm looking
for Dr. Torres. Yes. Hi.

50
00:01:51,145 --> 00:01:53,812
Great. You're being sued.

51
00:01:53,881 --> 00:01:56,164
Love what you're
doing here, by the way.

52
00:01:56,232 --> 00:01:58,299
Robot hands. Freaky.

53
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:00,347
Who is that from? - <i>Travis Reed?</i>

54
00:02:00,371 --> 00:02:02,070
As in the Travis Reed,
the snowboarder?

55
00:02:02,138 --> 00:02:04,740
Uh, he needs a new hip.
I told him he wants you.

56
00:02:04,808 --> 00:02:06,675
Wait. How do you even know him?

57
00:02:06,743 --> 00:02:10,378
I was a second-year resident. He
was my first solo valve replacement.

58
00:02:10,447 --> 00:02:12,526
Wow. Yeah, and six months
before he came out of nowhere

59
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:15,395
and won all those gold
medals on the half-pipe.

60
00:02:15,419 --> 00:02:17,063
I believe my valve is
what gives him his edge.

61
00:02:17,087 --> 00:02:18,119
Mmm-hmm.

62
00:02:18,205 --> 00:02:21,606
His heart is my <i>Mona
Lisa.</i> Don't screw it up.

63
00:02:21,675 --> 00:02:24,155
Excuse me. Where's the
onesie decorating station?

64
00:02:25,779 --> 00:02:26,939
There isn't one.

65
00:02:26,963 --> 00:02:28,775
There's a margarita
decorating station, though.

66
00:02:28,799 --> 00:02:29,975
What? Limes.

67
00:02:29,999 --> 00:02:31,477
Whoa, what kind of
baby shower... Salt.

68
00:02:31,501 --> 00:02:33,279
Doesn't have a onesie
decorating station?

69
00:02:33,303 --> 00:02:34,731
I mean, I had already
figured out my design.

70
00:02:34,755 --> 00:02:36,155
It was gonna be
a star and a moon,

71
00:02:36,223 --> 00:02:37,639
and it was gonna say "McDreamy."

72
00:02:37,707 --> 00:02:39,202
Get it? That's cute,
right? Excuse me.

73
00:02:39,226 --> 00:02:41,471
Is it time to open the gifts
yet? I need to sit down.

74
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:43,406
My feet are like sausages.
Oh, come on, Mer.

75
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,675
Oh, look at her. She's
all glowy and pregnant.

76
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:47,232
With sausage feet.

77
00:02:48,601 --> 00:02:50,735
Let's have a baby. What?

78
00:02:50,804 --> 00:02:52,081
Wait, wait. What,
are you serious?

79
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:54,406
We've had such a hard
year since the crash,

80
00:02:54,475 --> 00:02:55,807
and wouldn't it be nice

81
00:02:55,876 --> 00:02:57,637
to have something new
and happy to think about?

82
00:02:57,661 --> 00:02:59,360
Yes, yes. But, um...

83
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:01,140
And I could carry this time.

84
00:03:01,164 --> 00:03:03,726
And then that way, only one
of our feet would be sausages.

85
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:04,750
Arizona...

86
00:03:04,818 --> 00:03:06,067
So, you want to?

87
00:03:06,136 --> 00:03:08,202
Yes! Oh, my God, yes! Yeah?

88
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:09,471
You seem happy.

89
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:12,324
Oh, I am happy. I am
really, really happy.

90
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:15,238
He is so much more
attractive in person.

91
00:03:15,262 --> 00:03:17,073
I got him to sign my board.
I got him to sign my bra.

92
00:03:17,097 --> 00:03:18,208
Yeah, sign my cast.

93
00:03:18,232 --> 00:03:19,376
So are they.

94
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:23,768
Cristina Yang!

95
00:03:24,738 --> 00:03:27,272
Oh!

96
00:03:27,341 --> 00:03:30,002
Oh, you look better and
better every time I see you.

97
00:03:30,026 --> 00:03:31,388
Dump your husband.
Run away with me.

98
00:03:31,412 --> 00:03:33,039
Oh, come on. Don't
you have a girlfriend?

99
00:03:33,063 --> 00:03:34,228
We've got a deal.

100
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:35,725
I'm allowed to flirt
with hot doctors

101
00:03:35,749 --> 00:03:37,110
who've had their
hands inside my chest.

102
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:39,667
It's a very short list.

103
00:03:39,736 --> 00:03:41,414
Hey, I'm Travis. Hi.

104
00:03:41,438 --> 00:03:42,771
You're the ortho god?

105
00:03:42,839 --> 00:03:45,479
Callie Torres. I prefer
"goddess." Right on.

106
00:03:45,926 --> 00:03:47,871
Ready to build me a new hip?

107
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:49,744
<i>He needs to be able to do this.</i>

108
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:52,080
See? Right there.

109
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:53,514
Can a new hip do that?

110
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:55,161
More importantly, will he
be doing it by December?

111
00:03:55,185 --> 00:03:56,663
He's got Olympic
qualifiers coming up.

112
00:03:56,687 --> 00:03:57,797
You mentioned a crash last year?

113
00:03:57,821 --> 00:03:59,148
They said it gave me arthritis.

114
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:00,600
He can't win the
gold with arthritis.

115
00:04:00,624 --> 00:04:02,907
I want the Peterson hip.

116
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:04,304
Buddy of mine got this one.

117
00:04:04,328 --> 00:04:06,239
He was back on the
mountain in no time.

118
00:04:06,263 --> 00:04:07,503
This is what I need.

119
00:04:07,548 --> 00:04:08,647
Okay.

120
00:04:08,715 --> 00:04:10,048
Even if I did agree

121
00:04:10,117 --> 00:04:12,162
that a hip replacement is
the right course of treatment,

122
00:04:12,186 --> 00:04:15,136
I've never even used the, uh,
Peterson resurfacing hip joint.

123
00:04:15,205 --> 00:04:18,506
I doubt you or your team
want you to be my first.

124
00:04:18,575 --> 00:04:20,024
She makes a good point.

125
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:23,205
I was Yang's first valve
replacement. That worked out.

126
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:25,207
I was the first guy to land
a triple cork in competition.

127
00:04:25,231 --> 00:04:26,943
Now it's practically standard.

128
00:04:26,967 --> 00:04:28,511
You're the first
orthopedic surgeon

129
00:04:28,535 --> 00:04:30,952
to grow cartilage
out of nothing.

130
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:34,506
The reason we are who we are
is 'cause we're not scared of firsts.

131
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:44,316
I'll research the joint.
I'll learn what I can.

132
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:46,168
I'm not making any promises.

133
00:04:46,236 --> 00:04:49,754
I'm not worried.
You're gonna say yes.

134
00:04:49,823 --> 00:04:51,784
<i>For the hundredth time, no.</i>

135
00:04:51,808 --> 00:04:54,954
I am not admitting to negligence
when there was no negligence.

136
00:04:54,978 --> 00:04:57,579
They're willing to call
you a "non-party at fault."

137
00:04:57,647 --> 00:05:00,365
Jury payouts are always
bigger than pre-trial settlements.

138
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:01,633
If this goes south...

139
00:05:01,702 --> 00:05:03,229
Do you think it'll go south?

140
00:05:03,253 --> 00:05:05,098
There was a minor
complication during surgery

141
00:05:05,122 --> 00:05:07,884
because we thought the patient
had developed a pulmonary embolus.

142
00:05:07,908 --> 00:05:10,386
Post-operative infections
are a common recognized risk.

143
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:13,011
And that's when the
jury's eyes will glaze over.

144
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,157
All they're gonna
hear is a bunch of

145
00:05:14,181 --> 00:05:15,663
big words they don't understand.

146
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:17,265
And what they will see

147
00:05:17,334 --> 00:05:20,235
is that you made a mistake,
and your patient paid the price.

148
00:05:20,304 --> 00:05:23,824
No, it wasn't a mistake,
Greg. I'm not settling.

149
00:05:26,593 --> 00:05:28,313
Okay. Okay.

150
00:05:29,345 --> 00:05:30,946
Okay. Okay.

151
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:33,876
And there are things
to remember tomorrow.

152
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,678
Let the jury see your
face. You wear a suit.

153
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:37,986
Dark, not bright.
Skirt, not pants.

154
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:40,005
Minimal jewelry,
heels, panty hose...

155
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:41,117
Panty hose?

156
00:05:41,141 --> 00:05:42,674
Professional but feminine.

157
00:05:42,743 --> 00:05:44,876
You still have
your wedding ring?

158
00:05:44,945 --> 00:05:46,561
Yes. Wear it.

159
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:49,064
Juries respond better to
married women with families.

160
00:05:49,133 --> 00:05:50,844
Now there'll be water
in front of your seat.

161
00:05:50,868 --> 00:05:52,400
You drink it sparingly.

162
00:05:52,469 --> 00:05:54,147
There are no bathroom breaks
till the judge calls for recess.

163
00:05:54,171 --> 00:05:55,982
I don't own any panty hose.

164
00:05:56,006 --> 00:05:58,623
I have to go shopping.

165
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:00,942
Did you flush? I
didn't hear you flush.

166
00:06:01,011 --> 00:06:03,695
Oh, and wash your
hands! It's almost time to go!

167
00:06:03,764 --> 00:06:05,475
Hey, I'm sorry I'm
late. There was traffic.

168
00:06:05,499 --> 00:06:06,676
No, no, it's fine. She's ready.

169
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,311
She was, until she
decided she had to wear

170
00:06:08,335 --> 00:06:10,129
the purple dress
instead of the heart dress.

171
00:06:10,153 --> 00:06:12,682
And then she had to go potty, but
she didn't want help going potty. Sofia!

172
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:14,733
You should probably go check
and make sure she's okay in there.

173
00:06:14,757 --> 00:06:16,942
What, are you okay?
Uh, I have no idea.

174
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:18,755
Hey, listen, I know you're
supposed to have Sofia tonight,

175
00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:21,424
but if it'd be easier for you
to spend some time alone

176
00:06:21,448 --> 00:06:23,309
or if you'd rather not be alone,

177
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:24,661
then, you know,
you just tell me,

178
00:06:24,685 --> 00:06:26,979
and whatever you
need that's what we'll do.

179
00:06:27,003 --> 00:06:28,303
Okay, thanks.

180
00:06:32,359 --> 00:06:34,709
What? Nothing.

181
00:06:37,747 --> 00:06:39,047
You put your ring back on.

182
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:41,466
They told me to.

183
00:06:41,518 --> 00:06:43,501
Anyway, good luck today.

184
00:06:44,888 --> 00:06:46,104
Thanks.

185
00:06:54,264 --> 00:06:55,296
You ready?

186
00:06:55,365 --> 00:06:57,093
Sure.

187
00:06:58,969 --> 00:07:00,218
Excuse me. No comment.

188
00:07:01,538 --> 00:07:03,404
Uh...

189
00:07:03,473 --> 00:07:05,724
Greg. Greg! Step aside.

190
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:07,353
Good morning. Hey,
what are you doing here?

191
00:07:07,377 --> 00:07:09,110
Uh, a bunch of us
are taking shifts.

192
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:12,091
We wanted you to have at
least one person in court with you

193
00:07:12,115 --> 00:07:13,298
the entire time.

194
00:07:13,367 --> 00:07:15,127
I had to fight Bailey
for this first shift.

195
00:07:15,152 --> 00:07:17,496
Turns out she punches pretty
hard for such a little person.

196
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,806
Excuse us! Thank
you. Dr. Torres!

197
00:07:20,874 --> 00:07:23,591
I can't even swallow.
My mouth is so dry.

198
00:07:23,659 --> 00:07:26,723
You can do this. I will be
sitting right behind you. Okay?

199
00:07:26,747 --> 00:07:27,995
We're up here.

200
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:39,908
Callie? Hmm?

201
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,833
Oh, damn it!

202
00:08:08,171 --> 00:08:10,538
All rise.

203
00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:19,347
Would if I could.

204
00:08:22,986 --> 00:08:24,552
Crap.

205
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:36,626
This case is about a man
that you probably already know

206
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:39,250
at least by reputation,
Mr. Travis Reed.

207
00:08:39,319 --> 00:08:42,115
I got here as soon as I could.
My nephrectomy went long.

208
00:08:42,139 --> 00:08:43,471
What'd I miss?

209
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:45,084
They're still on
opening statements.

210
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:46,942
This guy's been
going for a while.

211
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:50,812
He's doing that folksy charm
thing, and the jury is eating it up.

212
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,892
Now serving as a juror in
a medical malpractice case

213
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:54,265
isn't easy.

214
00:08:54,334 --> 00:08:57,135
I don't know about
y'all, but I'm no doctor.

215
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:59,988
Hell, I barely made it through
high school biology, so...

216
00:09:01,591 --> 00:09:04,592
But you are going to get
a crash course education

217
00:09:04,661 --> 00:09:08,196
in orthopedic medicine
and post-operative infections.

218
00:09:08,265 --> 00:09:12,299
And you're gonna hear words
like "pseudomonas" and "emboli."

219
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:16,204
Don't let that intimidate you.

220
00:09:16,273 --> 00:09:19,356
The only thing that
matters is the evidence.

221
00:09:19,426 --> 00:09:21,420
Those things are part of the
evidence. What is he talking about?

222
00:09:21,444 --> 00:09:23,994
And the evidence in
this case will focus on

223
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:26,864
a 16-day period last spring.

224
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:28,833
And during this
time we will establish

225
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:32,220
that Dr. Torres agreed
to perform a surgery

226
00:09:32,289 --> 00:09:34,522
she did not fully understand.

227
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:39,060
We will establish that Dr. Torres
made a series of faulty decisions,

228
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:41,962
eventually costing
Mr. Travis Reed,

229
00:09:42,031 --> 00:09:44,765
a thriving, healthy
Olympic athlete,

230
00:09:45,601 --> 00:09:47,735
his legs.

231
00:09:47,804 --> 00:09:50,555
And we will establish
that all of this started

232
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:54,192
because of one careless
mistake made in surgery.

233
00:09:55,495 --> 00:09:58,079
Implant's in place.
Everything looks good.

234
00:09:58,148 --> 00:09:59,747
Now I just need to irrigate...

235
00:09:59,816 --> 00:10:01,944
His heart rate just
jumped to the 150s.

236
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:04,013
Having trouble ventilating.
Increasing his oxygen to 100%.

237
00:10:04,037 --> 00:10:05,398
Damn it. All right,
could be a PE.

238
00:10:05,422 --> 00:10:07,033
We've gotta get
him off this table.

239
00:10:07,057 --> 00:10:08,851
All right, let's start
closing. Irrigation, please.

240
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:10,803
Wait, the sponge count is
off. We're missing one sponge.

241
00:10:10,827 --> 00:10:12,971
Are you kidding me? We
can't close until we find it.

242
00:10:12,995 --> 00:10:15,508
Sats are continuing to drop.
Switching to manual ventilation.

243
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:17,142
All right, it's gotta be on
someone's shoe or something.

244
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:18,416
There's nothing in here.

245
00:10:18,485 --> 00:10:19,828
You want me to call
for a portable X-ray?

246
00:10:19,852 --> 00:10:21,013
No, that'll take too long.
He could go into shock.

247
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:22,281
BP's dropped to 70 over 40.

248
00:10:22,305 --> 00:10:23,971
Crap, crap, crap.

249
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,050
Are you sure you don't
want me to call for...

250
00:10:25,074 --> 00:10:26,590
No, there's no time.

251
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:27,787
All right, we're closing
him up. You can't do that!

252
00:10:27,811 --> 00:10:29,405
Well, you know, we
have to. Lap pads.

253
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:31,424
We still haven't... I don't
care. We're closing him up.

254
00:10:31,448 --> 00:10:32,480
Zero Vicryl.

255
00:10:33,349 --> 00:10:35,933
Zero Vicryl, now. Now!

256
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:39,187
<i>Hang on, hang on, hang on.</i>

257
00:10:39,255 --> 00:10:42,056
Are you saying
that Dr. Torres knew

258
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:44,858
she left a sponge
in Mr. Reed's body,

259
00:10:44,927 --> 00:10:46,144
and she didn't care?

260
00:10:46,213 --> 00:10:48,146
No, of course she cared, but...

261
00:10:48,215 --> 00:10:51,335
No, but still, she knowingly
left behind a sponge.

262
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:53,985
The patient was running
out of time. He would have...

263
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:57,689
Hon, hon, it's a yes or
no question. Thank you.

264
00:10:57,757 --> 00:11:00,157
Did she knowingly
leave a sponge?

265
00:11:03,947 --> 00:11:05,113
Yes.

266
00:11:06,566 --> 00:11:09,628
I've got a boy in
college. Good kid.

267
00:11:09,652 --> 00:11:11,381
And I went to visit
him last month,

268
00:11:11,405 --> 00:11:13,716
and you would not believe
the sponge I found in his sink.

269
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,685
I mean, there's no tellin'
what was growing on that thing.

270
00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:17,829
Objection.
Irrelevant. Sustained.

271
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,004
All right, let's fast-forward

272
00:11:19,028 --> 00:11:21,228
to the next time
you saw Mr. Reed.

273
00:11:21,297 --> 00:11:22,580
About two weeks later.

274
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:24,582
And how was he then?

275
00:11:24,651 --> 00:11:27,151
Was he good? Happy?
Recovering well?

276
00:11:29,222 --> 00:11:30,588
He had an infection.

277
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:32,407
Hi, there.

278
00:11:32,475 --> 00:11:34,120
Travis, I hear you
got quite the fever.

279
00:11:34,144 --> 00:11:36,572
Temp's 103. I'm just
starting his workup.

280
00:11:36,596 --> 00:11:39,531
He's burning up. He won't eat.
I had to force him to come in.

281
00:11:39,599 --> 00:11:40,809
How are you feeling, Travis?

282
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:42,500
I've seen worse.

283
00:11:42,569 --> 00:11:44,430
Dr. Torres, you wanna
take a listen to this?

284
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:45,669
Yeah.

285
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:47,538
Okay.

286
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:54,679
Is that a murmur? A small one.

287
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:57,515
Travis, I'm just gonna take a
look at your incision site, okay?

288
00:12:02,506 --> 00:12:03,771
Oh, wow.

289
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,489
"Oh, wow"? What
does "Oh, wow" mean?

290
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,169
Whitney, I don't
want you to worry.

291
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:08,638
The wound looks
a little infected.

292
00:12:08,662 --> 00:12:10,689
So we're just gonna go in
and clean it all out, okay?

293
00:12:10,713 --> 00:12:12,273
Yeah. Okay.

294
00:12:15,352 --> 00:12:17,146
Okay, get him on
vanc and clinda, stat.

295
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:18,881
Call upstairs. I need
an OR right now.

296
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:20,054
What about the murmur?

297
00:12:20,123 --> 00:12:21,133
Could the infection have
traveled to his heart?

298
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:22,740
His vitals are stable.

299
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:23,608
So first, we've got to
clean out that joint, okay?

300
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:24,687
We can't afford any delays.

301
00:12:24,711 --> 00:12:26,528
Okay. Should I call Yang?

302
00:12:26,596 --> 00:12:28,608
All right, if she's not available
in the next five minutes,

303
00:12:28,632 --> 00:12:30,014
she waits until post-op.

304
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,526
We've got to get in
there and kill this infection

305
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:33,162
before it spreads any further.

306
00:12:33,186 --> 00:12:36,746
I am not turning an Olympic
athlete into a doorstop.

307
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:40,636
Yeah, the infection's
going through the fascia

308
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,026
down to the prosthesis.

309
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:43,255
Get in here and irrigate
before we move on.

310
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:44,556
Looks like there's
pus in the acetabulum.

311
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:46,363
Oh, Damn it!

312
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:47,959
No, there's no way
to salvage the joint.

313
00:12:47,983 --> 00:12:49,562
I'm gonna have to
remove the whole thing.

314
00:12:49,586 --> 00:12:51,046
And just leave him with no hip?

315
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,870
Well, for now.

316
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:53,838
It's the only way to get
this completely cleaned out.

317
00:12:53,907 --> 00:12:55,106
Osteotome and mallet?

318
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:56,752
That sounds pretty nasty.

319
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,971
Post-op infections are very
common. They happen all the time.

320
00:12:58,995 --> 00:13:00,172
Is that your
professional opinion?

321
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:01,290
It is. I see.

322
00:13:01,314 --> 00:13:03,181
And in your
professional opinion,

323
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:04,532
is it also common

324
00:13:04,601 --> 00:13:07,313
for a post-op infection to
result in a double amputation?

325
00:13:07,337 --> 00:13:09,648
Does that happen all
the time, too? No, but...

326
00:13:09,672 --> 00:13:11,592
No further questions,
Your Honor.

327
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,201
That's not fair. You're
not letting me finish.

328
00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:15,187
That's enough, Dr. Wilson.
But I need to explain...

329
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:18,780
Another word out of turn,
and I'll hold you in contempt.

330
00:13:27,707 --> 00:13:29,323
Tell me I packed a spare pair.

331
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:32,210
Oh, thank God.

332
00:13:32,262 --> 00:13:35,162
Oh, hi. I'm sorry.
I'll come back.

333
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:37,181
No, no, no. It's fine.
It's fine. I'm just...

334
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,944
I have to sit in there
and listen to that guy.

335
00:13:38,968 --> 00:13:42,620
And I can't react or that'll
make me look unlikable or petty.

336
00:13:42,689 --> 00:13:44,400
But how the hell am I
not supposed to react?

337
00:13:44,424 --> 00:13:47,191
He's awful. And he's
making me sound awful.

338
00:13:49,596 --> 00:13:51,428
Um...

339
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:55,366
I think I have something
that will make you feel better.

340
00:13:55,434 --> 00:13:59,003
So Sofia drew this in
the car this morning.

341
00:13:59,072 --> 00:14:04,442
And she said that it's of a
jellyfish and a rainbow mermaid.

342
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,155
I'm not sure which one is which.

343
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:07,478
But you should have it.

344
00:14:07,547 --> 00:14:09,174
And then when you
feel like screaming,

345
00:14:09,198 --> 00:14:12,638
you can look at the jellyfish
and then it will calm you down.

346
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:14,301
Oh.

347
00:14:16,806 --> 00:14:19,139
I'm surprised you're here.

348
00:14:21,411 --> 00:14:23,444
Thanks. Thank you.

349
00:14:26,182 --> 00:14:29,117
I should get back. Oh, God.

350
00:14:30,804 --> 00:14:31,844
Um...

351
00:14:31,905 --> 00:14:33,248
Callie? Yes?

352
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:34,649
Are you sure that
you wanna wear, um,

353
00:14:34,673 --> 00:14:37,007
rhinestone butterflies in court?

354
00:14:37,077 --> 00:14:40,595
I mean, it's your
choice. It's a strange one.

355
00:14:40,663 --> 00:14:42,858
But I suppose that lots of
people like butterflies so...

356
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,015
Yeah.

357
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:45,983
They're cute.

358
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:48,393
What? What?

359
00:14:51,358 --> 00:14:53,291
Are you kidding me?

360
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,962
No more ridiculous than
vetoing every guy under 6'3."

361
00:14:58,031 --> 00:15:02,400
We are not choosing our sperm
donor based on his taste in music.

362
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:03,501
Well...

363
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:06,470
Oh, look. Oh, this one's cute.

364
00:15:06,539 --> 00:15:08,573
Oh, that's a super cute baby.

365
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:10,852
He would make super
cute babies. Yeah!

366
00:15:10,876 --> 00:15:13,010
Okay, so. Here... Oh.

367
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:14,606
Hmm. He's a college dropout.

368
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:16,108
Pass. Pass.

369
00:15:16,132 --> 00:15:17,564
Okay. Ooh, I'm empty.

370
00:15:19,135 --> 00:15:22,787
Now this one says he's a
mathematician with a graduate degree.

371
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:25,290
Oh, wow. And he runs marathons.

372
00:15:25,358 --> 00:15:27,058
Oh, picture?

373
00:15:28,912 --> 00:15:30,578
Oh.

374
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:32,847
Okay. Um...

375
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:35,165
Well, I still like the
Ivy League poet.

376
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:36,579
Okay, let's...
Smart and creative.

377
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:37,702
Okay.

378
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,612
You think I'll like
being pregnant?

379
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:43,590
Oh, yeah. It's the best.

380
00:15:43,659 --> 00:15:46,644
Oh, except for the nausea.
Oh, and the stretch marks.

381
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:48,563
And the peeing. Mmm.

382
00:15:48,631 --> 00:15:50,364
And the lack of
sleep, the exhaustion.

383
00:15:50,433 --> 00:15:52,483
Oh, and then the no booze.

384
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:55,399
No booze? Mmm-hmm.

385
00:15:55,989 --> 00:15:57,655
Oh. Mmm-hmm.

386
00:15:57,723 --> 00:15:59,857
Oh, I will miss you most of all.

387
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,247
Arizona?

388
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,817
You're early.

389
00:16:25,885 --> 00:16:28,525
I thought you said you weren't
bringing her by till after dinner.

390
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:32,770
Daddy. <i>Mija.</i>

391
00:16:37,313 --> 00:16:38,813
Mmm.

392
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:43,979
You mentioned the
trial like it was nothing.

393
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,237
It's never nothing.

394
00:16:46,306 --> 00:16:48,050
You know how many
times I've been sued?

395
00:16:48,074 --> 00:16:50,441
My lawyer's on speed
dial, for crying out loud.

396
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:53,538
He's very good. Technically,
his tactics are legal.

397
00:16:53,562 --> 00:16:55,241
You really didn't have
to come all this way.

398
00:16:55,265 --> 00:16:59,700
Of course I did. Of course
I did. My baby's in trouble.

399
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:02,314
But first, where's my
grandbaby? Mmm-hmm.

400
00:17:02,338 --> 00:17:04,621
Come on, now.
<i>Abuelo</i> needs a hug.

401
00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:08,153
Don't tell me she's
already asleep.

402
00:17:08,177 --> 00:17:09,643
No. No.

403
00:17:09,712 --> 00:17:11,244
She's, um...

404
00:17:11,313 --> 00:17:14,348
She's... She's not here.

405
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:16,600
Arizona's gonna
bring her by in an hour.

406
00:17:16,669 --> 00:17:20,069
Oh, all right. I don't
understand. What's going on?

407
00:17:22,492 --> 00:17:25,543
We split up. She cheated
on me. It's been bad.

408
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:27,289
I really don't
wanna talk about it.

409
00:17:27,313 --> 00:17:29,007
When did this happen?
A couple months ago.

410
00:17:29,031 --> 00:17:30,843
Why didn't you tell me? I
didn't wanna get into it, Dad.

411
00:17:30,867 --> 00:17:34,101
I fought so hard just
to get you to accept us.

412
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:37,438
Mom hasn't spoken to me
since the wedding, and I just...

413
00:17:37,507 --> 00:17:39,707
Apparently, I marry
people who cheat on me.

414
00:17:39,776 --> 00:17:41,608
It's pathetic.

415
00:17:41,678 --> 00:17:44,011
I am pathetic. No.

416
00:17:45,548 --> 00:17:47,159
When that O'Malley
kid cheated on you,

417
00:17:47,183 --> 00:17:48,761
I was ready to
knock his teeth out.

418
00:17:48,785 --> 00:17:50,212
Mmm. Mmm?

419
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:53,404
Now I won't hit a lady,
but I can make it happen.

420
00:17:53,472 --> 00:17:55,567
I know people. Just
say the word, all right?

421
00:17:55,591 --> 00:17:58,792
No, Dad. God, no.

422
00:17:58,862 --> 00:18:00,822
All right.

423
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:02,529
Look at me.

424
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:05,232
<i>Mija,</i> look at me.

425
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:13,572
Nothing about you is pathetic.

426
00:18:22,001 --> 00:18:23,684
<i>Don't hate me!</i>

427
00:18:23,752 --> 00:18:25,597
I know I said I was
gonna cook dinner tonight,

428
00:18:25,621 --> 00:18:26,320
but I've still got a lot
of work to catch up on.

429
00:18:26,389 --> 00:18:27,854
So... Who wants pizza?

430
00:18:27,923 --> 00:18:30,341
Hey, sweetie. Where's Mommy?

431
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:31,492
Callie?

432
00:18:31,561 --> 00:18:32,626
Yeah. Hi, I'm home!

433
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:34,840
Is everything okay?

434
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:35,864
Callie!

435
00:18:40,053 --> 00:18:42,135
Are you okay? Is
everything all right?

436
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:49,660
We're having a baby.

437
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:54,181
My boobs were hurting,
and then I thought, maybe,

438
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:55,649
but I'm only a day late,

439
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:58,397
and I didn't even think that it
would show up on a test so soon.

440
00:18:58,421 --> 00:19:00,204
We're having a baby!

441
00:19:02,842 --> 00:19:03,842
Oh!

442
00:19:05,228 --> 00:19:06,243
Hi.

443
00:19:06,996 --> 00:19:08,129
Hi, sweet baby.

444
00:19:09,098 --> 00:19:11,064
Mmm. Mmm. Mmm.

445
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:24,628
<i>Dr. Hernandez to oncology.</i>

446
00:19:24,697 --> 00:19:27,665
All right, gonna make this
quick. I know we are all busy.

447
00:19:27,734 --> 00:19:29,678
Callie, I thought you
understood you can't be here.

448
00:19:29,702 --> 00:19:31,180
I know. I know it's
a conflict of interest.

449
00:19:31,204 --> 00:19:34,104
I wanted to say something
before you get started.

450
00:19:34,174 --> 00:19:36,573
Travis Reed is suing
both me and the hospital.

451
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:39,843
I have no intention of settling
with him, but the hospital should.

452
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:41,707
As an owner and a
member of the board,

453
00:19:41,731 --> 00:19:43,792
I know how hard it's been to
get this place back on its feet.

454
00:19:43,816 --> 00:19:46,256
And I don't want you to
jeopardize that because of me.

455
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:54,519
What did our legal team say?

456
00:19:54,543 --> 00:19:56,310
Um, yeah, they
said that we should

457
00:19:56,379 --> 00:19:58,112
settle now, quickly and quietly.

458
00:19:58,181 --> 00:20:00,108
What if we don't? ALEX:
If this thing goes to trial

459
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:01,843
and there's a judgment
against us, we could owe millions

460
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,511
or we could settle
this for much less.

461
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:05,847
If we go to trial, we risk
bankruptcy all over again.

462
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:08,088
Only if we lose. There's
another side to this.

463
00:20:08,157 --> 00:20:10,435
If Callie isn't settling,
maybe neither should we.

464
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:12,209
Uh, no. I was there.

465
00:20:12,278 --> 00:20:13,822
I saw firsthand what
happened with this patient.

466
00:20:13,846 --> 00:20:16,797
And he has a case. A
good case. We should settle.

467
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,411
And, frankly,
Callie should, too.

468
00:20:19,435 --> 00:20:21,379
Dr. Yang, what is your
relationship with Travis Reed?

469
00:20:21,403 --> 00:20:25,021
Travis first came to me six years
ago with a bicuspid aortic valve.

470
00:20:25,091 --> 00:20:26,591
I replaced the valve

471
00:20:26,659 --> 00:20:28,537
and have overseen his
cardiac care ever since.

472
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:30,922
And it was you, I believe, who
recommended him to Dr. Torres.

473
00:20:30,946 --> 00:20:32,290
Is that right? That's right.

474
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:34,214
Why was that?

475
00:20:34,283 --> 00:20:36,161
Because she was the best
orthopedic surgeon I knew.

476
00:20:36,185 --> 00:20:40,921
Was? As in past tense?

477
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:43,230
You don't believe
she's the best anymore?

478
00:20:44,477 --> 00:20:46,517
There are vegetations
all over his aortic valve.

479
00:20:46,546 --> 00:20:47,873
Why didn't you page me sooner?

480
00:20:47,897 --> 00:20:48,973
We just heard the
murmur this morning.

481
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:50,859
This morning? Yeah.

482
00:20:50,883 --> 00:20:52,511
Look at this growth. You
knew he was a heart patient.

483
00:20:52,535 --> 00:20:53,550
This didn't concern you?

484
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:55,953
Of course it did.
That's why you're here.

485
00:20:56,005 --> 00:20:58,550
So what do we do? The
infection is eating away at his graft.

486
00:20:58,574 --> 00:21:00,919
Best case, I go in,
clean it out and repair it.

487
00:21:00,943 --> 00:21:02,893
Worst case, he needs
a whole new valve.

488
00:21:02,962 --> 00:21:06,597
Dr. Torres, you
need to see this.

489
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:08,811
I was changing his
compression socks and I saw this.

490
00:21:08,835 --> 00:21:10,967
His leg's gray, cold.
I can't find a pulse.

491
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:12,319
Okay, where's Whitney?

492
00:21:12,388 --> 00:21:14,232
I told her she had time to grab
lunch before Travis woke up.

493
00:21:14,256 --> 00:21:15,600
All right, you
need to go find her

494
00:21:15,624 --> 00:21:16,669
and tell her that Travis
needs another surgery.

495
00:21:16,693 --> 00:21:17,708
Okay.

496
00:21:20,329 --> 00:21:21,940
Okay, I've gotta go in and
do an embolectomy on this leg.

497
00:21:21,964 --> 00:21:23,392
Uh-uh. No. I gotta
go in and fix his heart.

498
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:25,059
You can do that later.
I need to do this now.

499
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:27,195
Later? It's already later.
He has lost blood flow!

500
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:29,347
He's clearly throwing
emboli into his extremities.

501
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:30,832
And where do you think
the emboli is coming from?

502
00:21:30,856 --> 00:21:31,884
His infected heart. Cristina...

503
00:21:31,908 --> 00:21:33,507
Hey, hey, hey!

504
00:21:33,576 --> 00:21:35,137
I can hear you two from all
the way the damn hallway.

505
00:21:35,161 --> 00:21:36,855
Will you tell Callie to back
off and let me do my job?

506
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:38,223
Yeah, tell Cristina to back
off and let me do mine.

507
00:21:38,247 --> 00:21:40,375
If I don't try this embolectomy,
he could lose his leg.

508
00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:42,794
He can live without a leg. He
can't live without a functioning heart.

509
00:21:42,818 --> 00:21:44,146
Look, if you do
the heart tomorrow,

510
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:46,065
it gives him an extra day
on antibiotics, all right?

511
00:21:46,089 --> 00:21:48,583
He'll be more stable, and the
heart surgery will be less risky.

512
00:21:48,607 --> 00:21:51,169
Cristina, this is Travis
Reed we're talking about.

513
00:21:51,193 --> 00:21:52,637
Let me try to save his leg.

514
00:21:52,661 --> 00:21:55,196
Dr. Torres performed the
embolectomy that afternoon.

515
00:21:55,264 --> 00:21:56,897
Against your wishes?

516
00:21:56,966 --> 00:21:59,199
We had a professional
difference of opinion.

517
00:21:59,268 --> 00:22:00,478
You know, in my office,

518
00:22:00,502 --> 00:22:03,437
if one of my co-workers
was shouting at me so loudly

519
00:22:03,505 --> 00:22:05,050
that you could hear him
all the way down the hall,

520
00:22:05,074 --> 00:22:07,169
it would be more than
just a difference of opinion.

521
00:22:07,193 --> 00:22:08,503
It would be grounds
for a dismissal.

522
00:22:08,527 --> 00:22:11,445
We are passionate
about our work.

523
00:22:11,513 --> 00:22:14,181
And in the end, I
agreed with Dr. Torres,

524
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:15,849
that the heart
surgery could wait.

525
00:22:15,918 --> 00:22:17,438
You agreed? Yes.

526
00:22:17,486 --> 00:22:19,148
Are you sure you
weren't bullied? Objection.

527
00:22:19,172 --> 00:22:20,571
Yeah, I know.

528
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:21,950
The embolectomy could
not have gone better.

529
00:22:21,974 --> 00:22:23,152
I mean, his leg was
already pinking up

530
00:22:23,176 --> 00:22:24,553
by the time I saw him
in recovery last night.

531
00:22:24,577 --> 00:22:25,976
What's his temp?

532
00:22:26,045 --> 00:22:28,173
Oh, he was febrile overnight,
but his white count's stable.

533
00:22:28,197 --> 00:22:29,529
All right.

534
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:33,217
What's going on? Travis?

535
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:36,125
What aren't you telling
me? What's wrong?

536
00:22:38,424 --> 00:22:40,624
What the hell is
wrong with my legs?

537
00:22:49,735 --> 00:22:51,763
Are we losing this case?
It's too early to panic.

538
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:53,564
We haven't presented our side.

539
00:22:53,588 --> 00:22:55,706
There she is.

540
00:22:55,775 --> 00:22:58,175
Richard! You shouldn't be here.

541
00:22:58,244 --> 00:23:01,078
That's what I told him,
but he insisted on coming.

542
00:23:01,146 --> 00:23:04,048
It's a miracle I made it here
at all. Kepner's a terrible driver.

543
00:23:05,484 --> 00:23:07,168
How's it going?

544
00:23:07,236 --> 00:23:09,736
<i>You knew it was bad.</i>

545
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:12,640
His legs were black.
I knew it wasn't good.

546
00:23:13,659 --> 00:23:15,559
They cut them off that night.

547
00:23:15,627 --> 00:23:16,938
Now, did you have any indication

548
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:18,390
that Dr. Torres was even worried

549
00:23:18,414 --> 00:23:20,175
about something like amputation?

550
00:23:20,199 --> 00:23:22,210
I mean, did she ever mention
that it might be even a risk?

551
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:25,603
No. But she was
worried about it.

552
00:23:25,671 --> 00:23:28,055
She was worried about what
it would do to her reputation.

553
00:23:28,124 --> 00:23:29,634
What is she talking about?

554
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:31,637
Now, why would you
say that? I have no idea.

555
00:23:31,661 --> 00:23:33,510
I heard her talking
in the hallway.

556
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:35,462
She didn't know
I could hear her.

557
00:23:35,531 --> 00:23:36,747
What did she say?

558
00:23:39,202 --> 00:23:40,779
<i>She said, "I can't be the doctor</i>

559
00:23:40,803 --> 00:23:43,420
<i>"who turns an Olympic
athlete into a doorstop."</i>

560
00:23:45,057 --> 00:23:48,158
All right, quiet down!
Quiet down, everyone!

561
00:23:48,878 --> 00:23:50,277
Quiet down!

562
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:52,046
<i>Do we knock?</i>

563
00:23:52,114 --> 00:23:54,059
No, there's an open house on
Sunday. We can come back then.

564
00:23:54,083 --> 00:23:55,944
Oh, oh! There's a swing set.

565
00:23:55,968 --> 00:23:57,980
Oh, and a pool! A pool!
Callie, there's a pool!

566
00:23:58,004 --> 00:23:59,948
Ooh! Yeah? Yeah.

567
00:23:59,972 --> 00:24:03,035
Oh, I can just see us playing
with the girls in this yard,

568
00:24:03,059 --> 00:24:06,093
having a picnic and
swinging on the swings.

569
00:24:06,162 --> 00:24:08,311
Oh. What makes you think
we're having another girl?

570
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,897
Come on.

571
00:24:09,966 --> 00:24:11,676
Can you get off of that
thing for five seconds

572
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,033
and look at this place?

573
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:14,429
Yeah, I know, hold on
a second. I'm just, uh...

574
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:15,630
I'm following up
on that clinical trial

575
00:24:15,654 --> 00:24:16,998
in Germany using
Peterson hip joints.

576
00:24:17,022 --> 00:24:18,634
I'm trying to get them
to send me their data.

577
00:24:18,658 --> 00:24:20,602
Well, they're not gonna release
anything until it's published.

578
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:22,259
Eh. It's worth a shot.

579
00:24:23,178 --> 00:24:24,658
There, sent.

580
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:25,412
All right, now you can
show me the swing set.

581
00:24:25,481 --> 00:24:26,696
Okay. Oh! Ooh.

582
00:24:26,765 --> 00:24:27,875
You okay? Yeah.

583
00:24:27,899 --> 00:24:29,394
You all right? I got it.

584
00:24:29,418 --> 00:24:30,467
<i>I've got it.</i>

585
00:24:51,307 --> 00:24:52,917
Do you swear to tell
the truth, the whole truth,

586
00:24:52,941 --> 00:24:54,981
and nothing but the truth? I do.

587
00:24:57,313 --> 00:24:59,193
Hey, Travis. Hey.

588
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:02,166
You know, I'm, uh...

589
00:25:02,234 --> 00:25:04,668
I'm thinking about snowboarding.

590
00:25:04,737 --> 00:25:07,037
In fact, I picked up a
board, a Burton Blunt.

591
00:25:07,105 --> 00:25:09,301
You familiar with that
one? That's a good board.

592
00:25:09,325 --> 00:25:10,502
There's better
boards for beginners.

593
00:25:10,526 --> 00:25:12,009
What size shoe are you?

594
00:25:12,077 --> 00:25:13,494
I'm a 13.

595
00:25:13,579 --> 00:25:15,407
You might wanna
look into an extra wide,

596
00:25:15,431 --> 00:25:17,225
so your toes don't
hang over too much.

597
00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:19,661
A little overhang's fine, but
too much is gonna cause drag.

598
00:25:19,685 --> 00:25:21,079
And drag's bad? Well...

599
00:25:21,103 --> 00:25:22,598
Objection, Your Honor.
Where's this going?

600
00:25:22,622 --> 00:25:24,883
Look, I'm simply consulting
an expert on snowboarding

601
00:25:24,907 --> 00:25:25,972
about a snowboard.

602
00:25:26,041 --> 00:25:27,608
I mean, who should I trust more,

603
00:25:27,676 --> 00:25:29,676
this guy or the kid who's
helping me out at REI?

604
00:25:29,745 --> 00:25:31,990
Get to the point, Mr. Hamilton.

605
00:25:32,014 --> 00:25:35,032
Travis, when you
first met Dr. Torres,

606
00:25:35,101 --> 00:25:36,595
did you ask her about
a certain kind of joint?

607
00:25:36,619 --> 00:25:39,915
The Peterson joint. I'd
heard it was good for athletes.

608
00:25:39,939 --> 00:25:41,750
Quicker recovery,
better range of motion.

609
00:25:41,774 --> 00:25:45,075
So you were consulting an
expert on joint replacement

610
00:25:45,144 --> 00:25:46,638
about a joint? Yeah.

611
00:25:46,662 --> 00:25:49,046
Is it true that Dr. Torres
had never actually done

612
00:25:49,114 --> 00:25:50,914
an operation with this
kind of joint before?

613
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:52,744
It's true. But you went
ahead with it anyway.

614
00:25:52,768 --> 00:25:54,245
She said she had
done a lot of research.

615
00:25:54,269 --> 00:25:55,714
She said she was confident.

616
00:25:55,738 --> 00:25:59,372
So you trusted her to use
her expertise to advise you

617
00:25:59,441 --> 00:26:01,007
and to keep you safe.

618
00:26:01,076 --> 00:26:04,344
When, in fact, what you
got was a botched surgery,

619
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:08,098
an infection, a revision
surgery, a heart surgery, and...

620
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:13,070
I mean, look at you now.

621
00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:15,658
<i>Just let me pull up the blanket.</i>

622
00:26:16,675 --> 00:26:19,877
Why? So you don't
have to look at them?

623
00:26:19,945 --> 00:26:22,479
There's nothing there.

624
00:26:28,103 --> 00:26:29,436
Is it her?

625
00:26:34,577 --> 00:26:35,642
Hey, Travis.

626
00:26:35,711 --> 00:26:36,926
Tell her to go.

627
00:26:36,995 --> 00:26:39,396
I don't wanna see her. I
don't wanna talk to her.

628
00:26:42,968 --> 00:26:44,367
Um...

629
00:26:44,437 --> 00:26:47,187
I just brought you some
information on support groups.

630
00:26:47,255 --> 00:26:48,855
Um, try to get him to go.

631
00:26:48,924 --> 00:26:50,324
And, on the back,

632
00:26:50,392 --> 00:26:52,220
there's a name of an
incredible prosthetist...

633
00:26:52,244 --> 00:26:53,911
Tell her to get out.

634
00:26:53,979 --> 00:26:55,219
<i>I trusted her.</i>

635
00:26:56,431 --> 00:26:59,583
I trusted her completely, and...

636
00:26:59,652 --> 00:27:02,230
You know, I get that
people live without legs

637
00:27:02,254 --> 00:27:04,374
and it's not the
end of the world,

638
00:27:06,025 --> 00:27:08,592
but it's the end of my world.

639
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:10,238
I've been snowboarding
since I was five.

640
00:27:10,262 --> 00:27:12,374
I used to steal cafeteria
trays from school

641
00:27:12,398 --> 00:27:14,309
and ride 'em down
my parents' driveway.

642
00:27:14,333 --> 00:27:16,633
Snow or no snow, I didn't care.

643
00:27:16,702 --> 00:27:18,680
It was the thing I did for fun.

644
00:27:18,704 --> 00:27:21,505
Then it became my
job and my world.

645
00:27:21,574 --> 00:27:26,260
And now it's everything.
My family, my friends.

646
00:27:26,328 --> 00:27:29,896
Without it, I don't
know who I am.

647
00:27:31,867 --> 00:27:34,107
And now it's gone. It's just...

648
00:27:36,588 --> 00:27:37,688
Gone.

649
00:27:44,396 --> 00:27:46,396
And it's Dr. Torres' fault.

650
00:27:53,906 --> 00:27:55,306
You feel very
strongly about that.

651
00:27:55,374 --> 00:27:56,873
It's not just a feeling.

652
00:27:56,942 --> 00:27:58,509
I know it. She told me.

653
00:27:58,577 --> 00:28:00,511
What, she admitted
that she was at fault?

654
00:28:00,579 --> 00:28:02,512
Yes, she did.

655
00:28:02,581 --> 00:28:04,882
The day she cut off my
legs, she came into my room,

656
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:06,432
she'd been crying.

657
00:28:06,501 --> 00:28:08,679
She told me she
was sorry. Objection!

658
00:28:08,703 --> 00:28:10,721
It is illegal to use a
physician's apology

659
00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:12,334
against them as
evidence of guilt.

660
00:28:12,358 --> 00:28:14,975
Your Honor, this isn't
about the apology.

661
00:28:15,043 --> 00:28:18,895
This is about everything
else she said with the apology.

662
00:28:18,964 --> 00:28:20,531
I'll allow it.

663
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:26,903
Travis, I know this is gonna be
painful, so you take your time.

664
00:28:29,008 --> 00:28:32,659
What else did Dr. Torres say?

665
00:28:32,728 --> 00:28:35,968
She said if there was
anyone to blame, it was her.

666
00:28:37,482 --> 00:28:39,344
She said this never
should've happened.

667
00:28:39,368 --> 00:28:42,597
She said if there was any way
she could change things, she would.

668
00:28:42,621 --> 00:28:44,721
Those were her exact words?

669
00:28:47,309 --> 00:28:48,842
Yes, they were.

670
00:28:55,217 --> 00:28:57,384
The prosecution rests.

671
00:29:08,313 --> 00:29:09,991
Yes, we had so much fun today.

672
00:29:10,015 --> 00:29:11,281
Big hugs.

673
00:29:11,349 --> 00:29:12,682
I love you. I love you.

674
00:29:12,752 --> 00:29:13,984
I know.

675
00:29:14,053 --> 00:29:16,419
Okay, all right, honey.
I'll see you soon.

676
00:29:16,488 --> 00:29:17,915
Hey, your dad's making
me a little nervous.

677
00:29:17,939 --> 00:29:19,083
Yeah, you should
probably go now.

678
00:29:19,107 --> 00:29:20,590
Definitely go now.

679
00:29:20,659 --> 00:29:21,958
Bye! Bye!

680
00:29:22,011 --> 00:29:23,643
Bye-bye. Bye-bye!

681
00:29:26,114 --> 00:29:28,781
Thank you for not
saying anything to her.

682
00:29:30,585 --> 00:29:32,763
If my grandbaby hadn't
been standing right there,

683
00:29:32,787 --> 00:29:34,666
believe me, I
would've said plenty.

684
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:37,591
Dad, don't start right now.
I have to be in court soon.

685
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:39,221
I have to take the stand
today, and I'm just...

686
00:29:39,245 --> 00:29:41,189
Your mother and I have
been married 38 years.

687
00:29:41,213 --> 00:29:42,824
You think it's been
easy? No, don't.

688
00:29:42,848 --> 00:29:44,109
You think we
haven't had troubles?

689
00:29:44,133 --> 00:29:45,965
Don't do that. Don't
start comparing. Don't.

690
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:48,813
What happened to her "good
man in a storm" baloney?

691
00:29:48,837 --> 00:29:50,336
It's not right.

692
00:29:50,406 --> 00:29:51,850
She should be here
every day trying to fix it.

693
00:29:51,874 --> 00:29:53,239
It's not like that.

694
00:29:53,308 --> 00:29:55,219
Oh, no? The hell it isn't.

695
00:29:55,243 --> 00:29:58,061
She hurt you, and now she's too
much of a coward to even face you.

696
00:29:58,130 --> 00:29:59,641
Now she's running away,
abandoning her family.

697
00:29:59,665 --> 00:30:02,549
No, she's not running away,
all right? I kicked her out.

698
00:30:02,618 --> 00:30:04,484
It was my choice to
split up. It was mine.

699
00:30:04,553 --> 00:30:06,986
All right, so just
drop it, okay?

700
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:08,899
You chose to break
up your family?

701
00:30:08,923 --> 00:30:10,640
Dad, not now.

702
00:30:13,545 --> 00:30:14,990
Did you even try
to work things out?

703
00:30:15,014 --> 00:30:16,846
Dad.

704
00:30:16,915 --> 00:30:18,360
<i>I knew what I was doing.</i>

705
00:30:18,384 --> 00:30:20,628
I did extensive research
on the Peterson hip.

706
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:22,953
I even spoke with the
team who invented it.

707
00:30:23,021 --> 00:30:26,034
Everyone agreed that
Travis was an ideal candidate.

708
00:30:26,058 --> 00:30:29,293
And the surgery?
It went smoothly?

709
00:30:29,361 --> 00:30:32,912
The cut position and the
femoral resurfacing were perfect.

710
00:30:32,981 --> 00:30:34,114
What wasn't perfect?

711
00:30:34,182 --> 00:30:36,900
At the end of surgery,
the patient desatted,

712
00:30:36,969 --> 00:30:39,085
which means his
oxygen level went down

713
00:30:39,154 --> 00:30:40,632
and his heart was
beating really fast,

714
00:30:40,656 --> 00:30:42,922
which is really dangerous.

715
00:30:42,991 --> 00:30:44,819
We thought he might
have a clot in his lungs,

716
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:46,988
so it was vital that we
finish the surgery quickly.

717
00:30:47,012 --> 00:30:49,707
And that's when you
left the sponge. Yes.

718
00:30:49,731 --> 00:30:51,197
And I would do it again.

719
00:30:54,753 --> 00:30:57,153
The patient's life was at risk.

720
00:30:57,222 --> 00:30:59,684
I believe that the sponge
wouldn't compromise the joint.

721
00:30:59,708 --> 00:31:02,392
I made a call, and I was right.

722
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:03,810
It was the right call.

723
00:31:03,879 --> 00:31:07,197
So leaving the sponge was
deliberate. Not a mistake.

724
00:31:07,266 --> 00:31:10,067
You weren't being
careless or distracted.

725
00:31:10,135 --> 00:31:12,163
<i>Make sure his BP and
O-2 sats stay stable.</i>

726
00:31:12,187 --> 00:31:14,899
And bring me his post-op
X-ray. I wanna locate that sponge.

727
00:31:14,923 --> 00:31:15,956
Got it.

728
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:19,058
Oh!

729
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:21,194
You missed our appointment. Hmm?

730
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:23,997
Oh, damn it!

731
00:31:24,083 --> 00:31:25,965
I'm so sorry.

732
00:31:26,034 --> 00:31:28,262
My surgery went long, and I
completely forgot. How'd it go?

733
00:31:28,286 --> 00:31:30,031
I mean, I know the ultrasound's
just a blob at this point,

734
00:31:30,055 --> 00:31:31,488
but still.

735
00:31:31,557 --> 00:31:33,557
Did you get a
picture of the blob?

736
00:31:34,509 --> 00:31:36,242
There's no picture.

737
00:31:37,111 --> 00:31:38,762
And no heartbeat.

738
00:31:39,464 --> 00:31:40,730
What?

739
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:44,984
She did the ultrasound and
she looked and she looked.

740
00:31:45,053 --> 00:31:47,036
But there's no heartbeat.

741
00:31:50,508 --> 00:31:53,710
We lost the baby?

742
00:31:53,779 --> 00:31:57,747
<i>I remember the day very
clearly. I wasn't distracted.</i>

743
00:31:57,816 --> 00:32:00,283
Sure, I had other
things going on.

744
00:32:01,353 --> 00:32:02,986
Big things, actually.

745
00:32:04,189 --> 00:32:05,733
But it's my job to prioritize

746
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:07,835
my patient, and that's
exactly what I did.

747
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:10,877
I wasn't focused on
anything or anyone

748
00:32:10,946 --> 00:32:13,447
other than my patient.

749
00:32:13,515 --> 00:32:15,766
Let's talk about
this embolectomy.

750
00:32:15,834 --> 00:32:18,401
Dr. Yang wanted to do
the heart surgery first.

751
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:20,453
You wanted to
work on Travis' leg.

752
00:32:20,522 --> 00:32:22,389
Yes. Why?

753
00:32:22,457 --> 00:32:24,502
Well, his foot was turning gray,

754
00:32:24,526 --> 00:32:28,495
which is an indication that
the limb is starting to die.

755
00:32:28,563 --> 00:32:31,064
And I wanted to
restore blood flow.

756
00:32:31,132 --> 00:32:33,311
Once a limb turns black,
there's nothing we can do.

757
00:32:33,335 --> 00:32:35,252
According to
Dr. Yang's testimony,

758
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,552
she wanted to go first

759
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:39,189
because the infection
had moved to Travis' heart,

760
00:32:39,241 --> 00:32:42,509
throwing out emboli, or
clots, all over his body.

761
00:32:42,578 --> 00:32:44,544
And she knew that

762
00:32:44,613 --> 00:32:47,258
the heart would keep throwing
out clots until it was repaired. So...

763
00:32:47,282 --> 00:32:48,498
Do you cook?

764
00:32:50,902 --> 00:32:52,018
Uh, a little.

765
00:32:52,887 --> 00:32:54,816
Okay, let's say you're cooking,

766
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,880
and you start a grease
fire in your kitchen.

767
00:32:58,176 --> 00:33:01,261
And then it spreads
to your curtains.

768
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:04,041
What do you do? Do you
put out the grease fire?

769
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:05,460
Or do you extinguish
the curtains?

770
00:33:05,484 --> 00:33:09,168
Which disaster
do you tackle first?

771
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:10,915
If I hadn't treated
the emboli when I did,

772
00:33:10,939 --> 00:33:12,783
Travis would've
lost his leg for sure.

773
00:33:12,807 --> 00:33:15,503
I was just picking which
disaster to tackle first.

774
00:33:15,527 --> 00:33:17,738
<i>I cannot believe you're
picking this fight right now!</i>

775
00:33:17,762 --> 00:33:19,573
I'm not trying to pick a fight.

776
00:33:19,597 --> 00:33:21,376
I am trying to
tell you how I feel.

777
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:24,183
Okay, I feel like crap, too.
Okay? It wasn't just your kid.

778
00:33:25,404 --> 00:33:27,336
I know. I know that.

779
00:33:30,492 --> 00:33:32,826
Look, we'll just...

780
00:33:32,895 --> 00:33:34,722
Look, we don't have to try
again right away, all right?

781
00:33:34,746 --> 00:33:35,990
We can wait a while
before we try again.

782
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:37,414
No. We...

783
00:33:37,482 --> 00:33:39,644
No, no. You're missing
the point. What point?

784
00:33:39,668 --> 00:33:44,087
I can't take another loss,
Callie. I can't handle it!

785
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:47,001
I can't think about
this right now.

786
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:49,476
It's too hard.
It's just too hard!

787
00:33:52,731 --> 00:33:54,014
What... What are you saying?

788
00:33:56,001 --> 00:33:57,684
Now you don't want another baby?

789
00:33:59,437 --> 00:34:00,920
Answer me.

790
00:34:03,391 --> 00:34:04,741
I don't know.

791
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:10,646
I have to go check
on my patient.

792
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:12,076
<i>Tell her to get out!</i>
WHITNEY: <i>Travis...</i>

793
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:14,601
I don't want her here.
Kick her out, Whit, now!

794
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:16,787
God knows I can't
do it by myself.

795
00:34:16,855 --> 00:34:19,756
So get her the hell out of here!

796
00:34:19,824 --> 00:34:22,108
What's wrong with you?
Why aren't you doing anything?

797
00:34:22,177 --> 00:34:24,711
Okay, that's enough!

798
00:34:24,779 --> 00:34:27,997
Whitney, go to the family
lounge and get a snack.

799
00:34:28,067 --> 00:34:29,499
We need a minute, okay?

800
00:34:43,398 --> 00:34:45,949
Don't you dare
take this out on her.

801
00:34:46,934 --> 00:34:49,302
You are hurt and angry,

802
00:34:49,371 --> 00:34:51,382
and you have every
right to feel those things.

803
00:34:51,406 --> 00:34:54,890
But Whitney has
nothing to do with that.

804
00:34:54,959 --> 00:34:56,571
You wanna take your
crap out on somebody,

805
00:34:56,595 --> 00:34:58,489
you take it out on me,
all right? I can handle it.

806
00:34:58,513 --> 00:35:00,975
You need somebody to
blame? Then blame me.

807
00:35:00,999 --> 00:35:02,999
Go on. Yell all you want.

808
00:35:07,172 --> 00:35:09,872
This never should've
happened to you.

809
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:13,660
And if there were any way that
I could magically change things,

810
00:35:13,728 --> 00:35:15,495
believe me, I would.

811
00:35:16,965 --> 00:35:19,246
I wish there was
something I could do.

812
00:35:19,785 --> 00:35:21,751
I wish I could fix this.

813
00:35:26,258 --> 00:35:30,393
I tried. I tried so hard.

814
00:35:32,364 --> 00:35:34,404
I'm so sorry, Travis.

815
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:38,451
I'm so, so sorry.

816
00:35:40,588 --> 00:35:42,255
<i>Yes, I apologized.</i>

817
00:35:43,291 --> 00:35:46,359
I understood what
Travis was feeling.

818
00:35:46,427 --> 00:35:47,839
I went through the
same thing with my wife.

819
00:35:47,863 --> 00:35:53,650
She lost her leg last year,
and, um, it's changed us.

820
00:35:53,718 --> 00:35:58,188
It's, uh, cost us in ways that I
can't even begin to understand.

821
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:03,343
I wouldn't wish this
experience on anyone.

822
00:36:03,412 --> 00:36:05,528
And now it was
happening to my patient.

823
00:36:05,597 --> 00:36:07,464
Of course I was sorry.

824
00:36:08,867 --> 00:36:10,433
I still am.

825
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:13,486
I'm so, so sorry this
happened to you, Travis.

826
00:36:13,555 --> 00:36:17,974
That makes me human. That
does not make me negligent.

827
00:36:18,043 --> 00:36:21,055
And if I can't feel for my
patients without getting sued,

828
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:22,857
then I guess I'm just
gonna keep on getting sued,

829
00:36:22,881 --> 00:36:24,714
because that's who I am.

830
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:27,750
I won't apologize for that.

831
00:36:33,292 --> 00:36:35,825
Dad, we're home. We're back.

832
00:36:35,894 --> 00:36:39,762
Oh, I guess he's still out
in the park with the girls.

833
00:36:39,831 --> 00:36:42,543
How long do you think it's gonna
take for the jury to come back?

834
00:36:42,567 --> 00:36:46,536
I don't know. Could be
days, sometimes weeks.

835
00:36:46,605 --> 00:36:48,037
What's that?

836
00:36:48,106 --> 00:36:52,959
I think it's from a clinical
trial on the Peterson hip.

837
00:36:53,028 --> 00:36:55,011
I thought I never heard back.

838
00:36:55,647 --> 00:36:57,346
Uh...

839
00:36:57,415 --> 00:36:59,015
"Enclosed is the
data you requested.

840
00:36:59,084 --> 00:37:01,596
"But please be advised, we've
currently put a stop to our trial.

841
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:03,453
"There've been five
instances of infection

842
00:37:03,521 --> 00:37:06,322
"caused by the
pseudomonas bacteria.

843
00:37:06,391 --> 00:37:09,759
"We've traced the source
back to the Peterson joint."

844
00:37:10,696 --> 00:37:12,736
What's the postmark on that?

845
00:37:14,999 --> 00:37:16,966
Three weeks before
Travis' surgery.

846
00:37:21,506 --> 00:37:23,017
I can't just sit on this. I
have to tell them, right?

847
00:37:23,041 --> 00:37:25,908
I wouldn't. You didn't
willfully ignore any data.

848
00:37:25,977 --> 00:37:28,311
You didn't act
irresponsibly or maliciously.

849
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:31,175
You worked off the
information you had at the time.

850
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:33,277
And then an act of God happened.

851
00:37:33,301 --> 00:37:35,429
The letter fell
behind the bookcase.

852
00:37:35,453 --> 00:37:37,481
It could've just as easily
gotten lost in the mail.

853
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:40,050
But it didn't. Accidents
happen. It's the job.

854
00:37:40,074 --> 00:37:42,253
This one happened in your
living room, not in the OR.

855
00:37:42,277 --> 00:37:44,977
You know, I was distracted.
I wasn't paying attention.

856
00:37:45,047 --> 00:37:46,557
I should've followed up
when I never heard back.

857
00:37:46,581 --> 00:37:48,409
You feel bad because
of what happened,

858
00:37:48,433 --> 00:37:49,732
and anybody would.

859
00:37:49,801 --> 00:37:51,495
But that envelope
is not a magic cure.

860
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:53,397
It's not going to
grow his legs back.

861
00:37:53,421 --> 00:37:55,633
But what it could do,
it could sway a jury.

862
00:37:55,657 --> 00:37:57,968
It could make a jury
think differently about you,

863
00:37:57,992 --> 00:37:59,903
and that could end your career.

864
00:37:59,927 --> 00:38:01,038
Not because you were negligent

865
00:38:01,062 --> 00:38:02,690
and not because you
did anything wrong.

866
00:38:02,714 --> 00:38:05,181
But because you feel bad?
Because you feel guilty?

867
00:38:05,249 --> 00:38:07,967
Let's not confuse
emotion with fact.

868
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:11,888
And the fact is, you
did nothing wrong.

869
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:13,656
Yes, I did.

870
00:38:16,695 --> 00:38:17,960
Hey.

871
00:38:19,263 --> 00:38:21,147
Okay. Thanks.

872
00:38:22,617 --> 00:38:24,683
They've reached a verdict.

873
00:38:27,188 --> 00:38:29,923
<i>We've all done things
we aren't proud of.</i>

874
00:38:34,229 --> 00:38:35,929
<i>I understand that.</i>

875
00:38:38,633 --> 00:38:40,649
<i>I know nobody's perfect.</i>

876
00:38:43,271 --> 00:38:45,288
<i>But how do you live with it?</i>

877
00:38:48,059 --> 00:38:50,438
<i>How do you get up every
morning and face the world,</i>

878
00:38:50,462 --> 00:38:53,312
<i>knowing you
could've done better?</i>

879
00:38:53,381 --> 00:38:55,221
<i>That you should've done better?</i>

880
00:38:59,504 --> 00:39:01,404
<i>Is being sorry enough?</i>

881
00:39:06,394 --> 00:39:09,111
<i>Can an apology
actually heal our wounds?</i>

882
00:39:17,388 --> 00:39:18,855
<i>Ease our pain?</i>

883
00:39:40,879 --> 00:39:43,329
<i>Can it undo the hurt
that we've caused?</i>

884
00:39:53,775 --> 00:39:55,352
<i>I really don't think so, Dad.</i>

885
00:39:55,376 --> 00:39:59,945
It's not enough. Just
because she says she's sorry...

886
00:40:00,014 --> 00:40:04,049
You're married. You took a vow.
You don't walk away from that.

887
00:40:04,118 --> 00:40:06,486
If things get hard,
you work harder.

888
00:40:06,554 --> 00:40:10,306
I mean, you have a child
together, for God's sake.

889
00:40:10,374 --> 00:40:12,291
She cheated on me.

890
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:17,213
I cheated on your mother.

891
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:20,917
What? I'm sorry, what?

892
00:40:20,986 --> 00:40:24,003
A long time ago. We
were young. I was stupid.

893
00:40:24,072 --> 00:40:25,471
Uh...

894
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:27,740
But your mother found it
in her heart to forgive me.

895
00:40:27,809 --> 00:40:28,886
Why?

896
00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:30,543
Why would she do that? Why?

897
00:40:30,611 --> 00:40:34,230
Because she believed we
were stronger than one mistake.

898
00:40:34,299 --> 00:40:37,217
And I thank God
every day she did.

899
00:40:37,285 --> 00:40:40,052
Because otherwise,
I wouldn't have you.

900
00:40:42,591 --> 00:40:45,358
Thirty-eight years.
We've shared a life.

901
00:40:46,645 --> 00:40:49,579
And it all started
after that one mistake.

902
00:40:51,249 --> 00:40:53,193
Now things between you
and Arizona might not work out.

903
00:40:53,217 --> 00:40:55,652
You know, you might
not be able to fix it.

904
00:40:57,172 --> 00:40:59,789
But how will you
know if you never try?

905
00:41:11,503 --> 00:41:12,969
Just a second!

906
00:41:13,871 --> 00:41:15,571
Hi...

907
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,674
Oh, you're not bringing
me extra pillows.

908
00:41:17,742 --> 00:41:21,594
You did something impulsive, and
you were thinking about yourself.

909
00:41:21,662 --> 00:41:24,497
It seemed right at
the time, and, uh,

910
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:27,133
you made a mistake.

911
00:41:27,202 --> 00:41:29,246
One mistake. Do we
have to get into this now?

912
00:41:29,270 --> 00:41:31,265
I did something like that today.

913
00:41:31,289 --> 00:41:32,321
Oh.

914
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:33,590
Okay.

915
00:41:33,658 --> 00:41:35,069
Look, I have something to ask,

916
00:41:35,093 --> 00:41:37,722
and, uh, you should probably
take some time to think about it.

917
00:41:37,746 --> 00:41:40,746
I don't need an answer
tonight, but I would like to know

918
00:41:42,734 --> 00:41:44,484
if you'll come home.

919
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:10,793
You should get
dressed now and leave.
