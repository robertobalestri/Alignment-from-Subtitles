1
00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:04,081
<i>The Harper Avery is
one of the highest awards</i>

2
00:00:04,105 --> 00:00:05,770
<i>a surgeon can earn.</i>

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:07,584
<i>They always make the
calls to the nominees</i>

4
00:00:07,608 --> 00:00:09,875
<i>on the same Friday
of the same month</i>

5
00:00:09,943 --> 00:00:13,012
<i>at 8:00 a.m. east coast time.</i>

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,412
<i>5:00 a.m. in Seattle.</i>

7
00:00:16,183 --> 00:00:17,611
Crap, Mer! Oh, my
God! The phone!

8
00:00:17,635 --> 00:00:18,745
Mer! Oh, the phone!

9
00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:20,013
I'm sorry! No, the phone.

10
00:00:20,037 --> 00:00:21,347
Okay, okay, okay.
Did we remember to...

11
00:00:21,371 --> 00:00:23,355
No, no, it's charged. Oh, God!

12
00:00:23,423 --> 00:00:25,724
It's charged, and the
ringer's on. Okay, hold on.

13
00:00:25,792 --> 00:00:27,926
You got to put on
some lipstick. Here.

14
00:00:27,994 --> 00:00:32,014
<i>My mother was nominated five
times. I've been through this before.</i>

15
00:00:32,082 --> 00:00:33,315
What if...

16
00:00:33,383 --> 00:00:36,218
No, it's not possible,
because Catherine Avery said

17
00:00:36,287 --> 00:00:37,619
that you were on the short list,

18
00:00:37,688 --> 00:00:39,488
and your project
is... It's innovative.

19
00:00:39,557 --> 00:00:42,641
It's gonna lead to the
actual printing of hearts.

20
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:43,742
Millions will be saved.

21
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:45,272
What time is it? 5:01.

22
00:00:45,296 --> 00:00:46,816
Did they? Not yet.

23
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,258
Did they? No.

24
00:00:48,282 --> 00:00:49,814
Oh, God!

25
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:53,251
Okay, listen, if there are five
nominees, it's alphabetical.

26
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,369
Yang is last.

27
00:00:55,723 --> 00:00:56,838
Oh!

28
00:00:56,906 --> 00:00:58,251
Oh, geez, hairball! Oh, sorry!

29
00:00:58,275 --> 00:00:59,552
It's Shane. What are you...

30
00:00:59,576 --> 00:01:01,688
Hey. No. Not yet,
but it's still early.

31
00:01:01,712 --> 00:01:03,144
It's... 5:02.

32
00:01:03,213 --> 00:01:06,932
<i>If the phone rings,
everything changes.</i>

33
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,434
<i>Suddenly, you're a superstar.</i>

34
00:01:09,503 --> 00:01:11,954
<i>If it doesn't... I don't know.</i>

35
00:01:12,022 --> 00:01:15,274
<i>My mom was a superstar.
She always got the call.</i>

36
00:01:15,342 --> 00:01:17,576
Mer, seriously, what
if they don't call?

37
00:01:22,465 --> 00:01:23,843
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

38
00:01:23,867 --> 00:01:25,045
What do I do? Answer it.

39
00:01:25,069 --> 00:01:26,513
It's Boston. It's
Boston. It's them.

40
00:01:26,537 --> 00:01:27,652
Okay.

41
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:29,321
Wait, wait, wait. Okay. Okay.

42
00:01:29,373 --> 00:01:32,257
You are gonna be
gracious and humble.

43
00:01:32,326 --> 00:01:35,109
You are gonna thank them,
but you are not gonna grovel.

44
00:01:35,179 --> 00:01:37,262
You remember who you
are. You are Cristina Yang,

45
00:01:37,331 --> 00:01:39,748
and you are going to
change the face of medicine.

46
00:01:39,817 --> 00:01:41,494
Go. Just answer the damn phone!

47
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:43,118
Quiet!

48
00:01:43,187 --> 00:01:44,187
Stay still.

49
00:01:46,323 --> 00:01:47,555
Hello?

50
00:01:49,093 --> 00:01:50,592
Yes, this is Cristina Yang.

51
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:53,562
He said "we"?

52
00:01:53,647 --> 00:01:55,647
You're sure Shane said "we"?

53
00:01:55,715 --> 00:01:59,584
He said, "Did we
get the nomination?"

54
00:01:59,653 --> 00:02:02,354
The way he sees it, he
and Yang just got nominated

55
00:02:02,422 --> 00:02:04,756
for the highest surgical
honor in the land.

56
00:02:04,824 --> 00:02:06,558
He's gonna be insufferable now.

57
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:08,971
We have to knock him down a
peg. He's still your swap monkey.

58
00:02:08,995 --> 00:02:10,607
I can't do that today.
I'm not that horrible.

59
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:11,631
You kind of are.

60
00:02:11,698 --> 00:02:13,458
Hey, Frankie. Hey.

61
00:02:16,437 --> 00:02:18,203
Cristina got nominated!

62
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:20,505
This is her getting the call.

63
00:02:20,574 --> 00:02:22,307
She's wearing
lipstick at 5:00 a.m.?

64
00:02:22,376 --> 00:02:23,803
That's cute. Hey, Frankie.

65
00:02:23,827 --> 00:02:25,388
We got a round soon,
so don't be late. Okay.

66
00:02:25,412 --> 00:02:26,907
All right, I'm gonna get
these guys into daycare,

67
00:02:26,931 --> 00:02:28,008
and then I'll see
you at the MEG.

68
00:02:28,032 --> 00:02:29,309
All right. I'll meet you there.

69
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:30,493
See you. Yeah.

70
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:31,561
You guys got a MEG? Yeah.

71
00:02:31,585 --> 00:02:32,929
It's gonna make
screening candidates

72
00:02:32,953 --> 00:02:34,364
for the trial so
much more efficient.

73
00:02:34,388 --> 00:02:35,932
Doesn't that cost
like a jillion dollars?

74
00:02:35,956 --> 00:02:37,500
Yeah. Derek working for
the government has its perks.

75
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:39,491
Oh, you want a Harper Avery.

76
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:42,660
I want to make an
amputee walk using robotics,

77
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:44,829
and if I win a Harper
Avery in the process,

78
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:46,331
I won't turn it down.

79
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,000
Well, now's the time.

80
00:02:48,068 --> 00:02:50,168
I mean, Sofia's
almost in school all day,

81
00:02:50,237 --> 00:02:52,404
and the time-consuming
baby days are over.

82
00:02:52,473 --> 00:02:53,538
Unless they're not.

83
00:02:53,607 --> 00:02:55,185
Oh, I say we quit
while we're ahead.

84
00:02:55,209 --> 00:02:57,725
Yeah. Yeah. Sofia's pretty
perfect. Why tempt fate?

85
00:02:57,794 --> 00:03:00,140
Yeah, and I can actually
finally have a thought.

86
00:03:00,164 --> 00:03:01,908
Is that thought, "Where's
my Harper Avery?"

87
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:03,765
Ooh, hey, maybe.

88
00:03:03,834 --> 00:03:05,127
All right. Maybe.

89
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:11,190
Hey, Frankie.

90
00:03:11,258 --> 00:03:12,757
Morning, Dr. Avery.

91
00:03:12,826 --> 00:03:15,510
Hey, are you named after that
big award, the Harper Avery?

92
00:03:15,578 --> 00:03:18,330
It's actually named
after me, after my family.

93
00:03:18,399 --> 00:03:20,732
How did you hear about...

94
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,167
Okay. Hey.

95
00:03:22,236 --> 00:03:24,636
Hey. Did you go home?
I must have missed you.

96
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:27,639
Yeah, I had a 14-year-old
GSW. It was so bloody.

97
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:30,242
I felt nasty after surgery,
so I went home to change.

98
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,621
Cool news about
Yang, though, huh?

99
00:03:31,645 --> 00:03:33,311
Yeah.

100
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,712
You really didn't know?

101
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:36,226
I'm telling you, the
nominating committee

102
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,494
is totally separate
from the foundation.

103
00:03:37,518 --> 00:03:39,284
I'm just like everybody else.

104
00:03:39,353 --> 00:03:41,420
Only way handsomer.

105
00:03:47,127 --> 00:03:48,993
Is that a swimsuit?

106
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,807
Yes, I ran out of
clean underwear

107
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:52,459
and haven't had a
chance to do laundry.

108
00:03:52,483 --> 00:03:53,915
Which is why you send it out.

109
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,662
We have a perfectly good
washing machine at the house.

110
00:03:55,686 --> 00:03:57,803
Says the doctor in a speedo.

111
00:03:57,871 --> 00:04:01,372
Paying someone to do your
laundry is an extravagance.

112
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:03,241
How much did that coffee cost?

113
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,809
Four bucks.

114
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:07,495
So, that's like,
what, six a week?

115
00:04:07,564 --> 00:04:09,376
That's like... Give me
a second. Carry the...

116
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,867
Like $1,000 a year
you're just throwing away.

117
00:04:12,936 --> 00:04:15,503
It's not like I'm spending it
on hookers or private planes.

118
00:04:15,572 --> 00:04:17,138
It's a latte.

119
00:04:17,207 --> 00:04:19,319
I'm gonna get you one
of those milk-frothy things.

120
00:04:19,343 --> 00:04:21,676
I'm gonna teach you how
to make your own latte.

121
00:04:21,745 --> 00:04:23,862
Will you do it in that swimsuit?

122
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:25,892
Hmm? Stop.

123
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:29,184
Okay, so there was a gang
shooting last night, so the ER's crazy.

124
00:04:29,252 --> 00:04:31,397
And that preemie I told you
about? She gained two ounces,

125
00:04:31,421 --> 00:04:33,688
and the nurses are like,
"Doesn't she look fat?"

126
00:04:33,757 --> 00:04:36,657
And I'm like, "No, she
looks like a naked mole rat."

127
00:04:36,727 --> 00:04:38,993
And my doctor got
nominated for some prize,

128
00:04:39,062 --> 00:04:40,239
and everyone's really jealous.

129
00:04:40,263 --> 00:04:41,329
That's cool.

130
00:04:42,065 --> 00:04:43,682
Not as cool as that.

131
00:04:43,751 --> 00:04:45,016
Yeah.

132
00:04:45,085 --> 00:04:46,246
My parents try to
distract me from the fact

133
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:47,536
that I'm trapped in a bubble.

134
00:04:47,604 --> 00:04:49,249
Well, aren't you getting
some test results back today

135
00:04:49,273 --> 00:04:50,472
that are gonna get you out?

136
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:51,806
Yeah.

137
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,452
Here they come. Come visit me.

138
00:04:53,476 --> 00:04:55,610
My brother's room is
end of the hall on the right.

139
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:58,012
Well, there he is.

140
00:04:58,081 --> 00:04:59,180
Hey, Brady bug.

141
00:04:59,249 --> 00:05:00,281
Braden.

142
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:01,594
Up high, champ. Hi, baby.

143
00:05:01,618 --> 00:05:03,751
Mom, why are you crying?

144
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:04,920
Oh, I'm...

145
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:06,854
I'm not.

146
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:10,442
I'm sorry. I can't.

147
00:05:13,614 --> 00:05:17,198
Unfortunately, your
T-cell count is still zero.

148
00:05:17,267 --> 00:05:18,666
Your infection
is almost cleared,

149
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:20,747
but we were hoping for
your T cell count to respond.

150
00:05:20,771 --> 00:05:22,036
I get it.

151
00:05:22,105 --> 00:05:24,606
But I don't understand
why my mom's crying.

152
00:05:24,674 --> 00:05:26,974
There's got to be other
stuff you guys can try.

153
00:05:27,043 --> 00:05:29,905
You're not gonna make me live
in this bubble for the rest of my life.

154
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:31,429
Dad?

155
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:32,930
It's not so simple, bud.

156
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,001
Your body has no
ability to fight infection,

157
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:38,436
and the enzyme's
not working anymore.

158
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:40,905
Bone-marrow transplants in
kids with SCID can be effective,

159
00:05:40,974 --> 00:05:42,474
so we're still
looking for a match.

160
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:44,487
They've been looking for a
match for me since I was a baby,

161
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:45,554
and they haven't found one.

162
00:05:45,578 --> 00:05:46,818
What if you still can't?

163
00:05:50,334 --> 00:05:53,284
No other treatment
for your disease exists.

164
00:05:53,354 --> 00:05:58,122
We're working on it,
but for the time being,

165
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:01,092
your only safe place
is right where you are.

166
00:06:07,735 --> 00:06:09,334
Hey, Frankie. You're late.

167
00:06:09,403 --> 00:06:11,715
I'm not a patient anymore,
so I don't have to be at rounds.

168
00:06:11,739 --> 00:06:13,037
But you do.

169
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:14,346
You're right. I'm late.

170
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:16,140
Want to race? Yeah. Come on.

171
00:06:17,327 --> 00:06:18,960
I got you! Come on! Come on!

172
00:06:19,029 --> 00:06:20,273
Hey, hey! Slow down!

173
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:21,930
That's not fair! Come on!

174
00:06:24,835 --> 00:06:25,917
Hey, Linkie.

175
00:06:25,985 --> 00:06:27,196
I got you a
chocolate chip muffin

176
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,364
for when you're feeling better.

177
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:29,748
Well, how are you
feeling, Frankie?

178
00:06:29,772 --> 00:06:31,284
Pretty good. She just
beat me in a race, so...

179
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:34,142
Looks like that pacemaker
I put in is working.

180
00:06:34,211 --> 00:06:35,243
And...

181
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:36,961
Seriously, Ivy.

182
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:38,710
Sour-cream-and-onion
chips for breakfast?

183
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:40,426
You said I should put on weight.

184
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:42,484
Good.

185
00:06:42,552 --> 00:06:44,603
So, two weeks
post-op heart transplant,

186
00:06:44,671 --> 00:06:46,705
and Ivy's indices are excellent.

187
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:48,189
And Mr. Link?

188
00:06:48,257 --> 00:06:50,336
Lincoln McNeil, age 9,
end-stage heart failure,

189
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:53,561
awaiting transplant, status 1A.

190
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:55,541
There's a family
history of the disease.

191
00:06:55,565 --> 00:06:57,065
The cause is still unknown.

192
00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:00,063
Link first showed signs of
cardiomyopathy two weeks ago

193
00:07:00,087 --> 00:07:02,353
and has deteriorated rapidly.

194
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:05,340
An attempt to put him
on a Berlin Heart failed...

195
00:07:05,409 --> 00:07:07,020
Due to something
I can't remember.

196
00:07:07,044 --> 00:07:08,109
Clotting.

197
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:09,322
That's it.

198
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:12,764
The patient is now
on ECMO and is...

199
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:14,098
Stable.

200
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:16,067
I couldn't have
said it better myself.

201
00:07:16,136 --> 00:07:18,014
Thanks. So, where
are we with UNOS?

202
00:07:18,038 --> 00:07:20,872
Well, Link is at
the top of the list.

203
00:07:20,924 --> 00:07:23,241
How much longer can
he survive on ECMO?

204
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,610
Well, with sweep
numbers this low...

205
00:07:26,296 --> 00:07:27,896
At least a week.

206
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:30,732
So, we pray for a miracle?

207
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,783
We got one with Ivy.

208
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:35,236
We're not just sitting
around and waiting.

209
00:07:35,305 --> 00:07:37,622
We are aggressively
looking at other options.

210
00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:40,408
In the meantime...

211
00:07:41,644 --> 00:07:43,427
Heart-healthy food, okay?

212
00:07:45,815 --> 00:07:48,183
So, I put a call in to
these guys from Stanford

213
00:07:48,251 --> 00:07:50,919
who are doing animal testing
with a drug-eluting pump

214
00:07:50,987 --> 00:07:52,420
to prevent clotting.

215
00:07:52,488 --> 00:07:55,724
Never been tried on
humans, but Link is a little kid.

216
00:07:55,792 --> 00:07:57,709
The fit might be
right. It could work.

217
00:07:57,778 --> 00:07:59,922
I'll let you guys
know what they say.

218
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:01,879
So, that's how
you're gonna play this,

219
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:04,165
act like it's just another
day at the office?

220
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:05,311
It is.

221
00:08:05,335 --> 00:08:07,919
No, see, I need details.

222
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:09,253
So, what did they say?

223
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,367
"Congratulations." And
then what did you say?

224
00:08:11,391 --> 00:08:12,802
"Thank you."

225
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:14,303
Cristina... No,
no, really, really,

226
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:15,943
it's just a nomination.

227
00:08:16,012 --> 00:08:19,080
I'm happy about it, but
I've got a ton of work to do.

228
00:08:19,149 --> 00:08:20,531
I want to focus on that.

229
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,768
I really don't want to
make a big deal out of it.

230
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:25,782
Hey, hey. Let's
go this way. Yeah.

231
00:08:25,806 --> 00:08:27,055
You know, get some breakfast?

232
00:08:27,123 --> 00:08:28,639
Why? I got my chips.

233
00:08:31,461 --> 00:08:32,910
Surprise!

234
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:39,867
Congratulations, Dr. Yang!

235
00:08:42,072 --> 00:08:43,537
Whose idea was this?

236
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:45,440
Meredith's.

237
00:08:45,508 --> 00:08:47,175
Congratulations, Yang.

238
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:07,378
Innovation.
Imagination. Excellence.

239
00:09:07,447 --> 00:09:11,082
Oh, soak it in, doctors.
It's all around you.

240
00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:13,251
It's mostly hovering
around Dr. Yang,

241
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:15,353
and Shane's kind of hogging her.

242
00:09:15,422 --> 00:09:17,755
I'm not just talking
about Dr. Yang.

243
00:09:17,824 --> 00:09:19,490
Dr. Shepherd is
testing a new machine

244
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,859
that can read emotions
and has applications

245
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:23,405
for the work that he
and Dr. Torres are doing.

246
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:24,696
Torres! Me!

247
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:27,231
Hey, Dr. Grey is
about to do the first

248
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:31,002
HIV-positive-to-positive
kidney transplant in the state

249
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:32,764
since the new law went
into effect in November.

250
00:09:32,788 --> 00:09:33,933
That's history in
the making. It's mine.

251
00:09:33,957 --> 00:09:35,640
And Dr. Bailey's looking for

252
00:09:35,709 --> 00:09:38,192
a genetic cure for a kid
who lacks an immune system.

253
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:41,312
Edwards?

254
00:09:41,381 --> 00:09:42,892
I was on her service yesterday.
She's not doing anything.

255
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,293
She's just staring at
a computer screen.

256
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:46,401
That is not nothing.
She's thinking.

257
00:09:46,469 --> 00:09:47,918
Her brain is turning,

258
00:09:47,987 --> 00:09:50,238
building up to that
moment of inspiration.

259
00:09:50,306 --> 00:09:54,442
It'll look like nothing, but in a
moment... Pow! The Fourth of July.

260
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:56,928
Don't blink. You'll miss it.

261
00:09:58,898 --> 00:10:01,677
It was like that with me
and Yang at first, too.

262
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:05,221
A lot of staring at computer
screens, and now look at us.

263
00:10:05,489 --> 00:10:07,054
Oh, Shane.

264
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:09,657
Oh, Shane, Shane, Shane.

265
00:10:09,726 --> 00:10:10,925
No.

266
00:10:10,993 --> 00:10:12,793
I wasn't gonna do
this to you today.

267
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:14,307
I really wasn't. Was I, ladies?

268
00:10:14,331 --> 00:10:15,741
She wasn't. Hand to God.

269
00:10:15,765 --> 00:10:17,243
But you just got too
big for your britches.

270
00:10:17,267 --> 00:10:18,845
It's not even interesting stuff.

271
00:10:18,869 --> 00:10:20,379
I'm just in the printing lab
making sample conduits.

272
00:10:20,403 --> 00:10:22,670
Well, not anymore, swap monkey!

273
00:10:22,738 --> 00:10:25,256
Enjoy working with Dr. Bailey.

274
00:10:25,325 --> 00:10:26,958
Pow! Fourth of July!

275
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:30,415
Sucks. Swap monkey!

276
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:31,729
Okay, guys, bear with me.

277
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:33,342
I know we've gone
through all this before,

278
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:35,444
but the hospital just needs
your consent one more time.

279
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,668
Go ahead, Murphy.
State your name.

280
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:39,204
Keith Kalber.

281
00:10:39,272 --> 00:10:40,917
Keith, you understand that
the kidney you're getting today

282
00:10:40,941 --> 00:10:43,886
is being donated from a
person infected with HIV?

283
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:45,377
I should hope so.

284
00:10:45,445 --> 00:10:47,423
I was there the day
he got his diagnosis.

285
00:10:47,447 --> 00:10:50,226
And although small, there
is a risk of superinfection

286
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,851
by mixing his strain
of the virus with yours.

287
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:54,936
Knowing this, do you
still wish to proceed?

288
00:10:55,004 --> 00:10:56,370
I do.

289
00:10:56,439 --> 00:10:59,006
God, it feels like
we're getting married.

290
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:00,686
How would you
know how that feels?

291
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:02,243
Excuse me?

292
00:11:02,311 --> 00:11:04,863
He always has the best
boyfriends, but he refuses to commit.

293
00:11:04,931 --> 00:11:08,766
Can we just get back
to my huge sacrifice?

294
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:10,647
Marty, you understand

295
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:13,171
that the risks of donation
are similar to those involved

296
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:16,474
with any major surgery, such
as bleeding and infection?

297
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:18,087
And death resulting
from kidney donation

298
00:11:18,111 --> 00:11:19,351
is extremely rare.

299
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,496
Define "extremely."

300
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:25,066
.06%.

301
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,269
Um...

302
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:33,024
We've beaten worse odds.

303
00:11:33,093 --> 00:11:34,192
Oh, yeah.

304
00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:41,928
Now, before we drill
into someone's brain,

305
00:11:41,952 --> 00:11:44,530
we need to make sure they're
good candidates for robotics work.

306
00:11:44,554 --> 00:11:46,999
They need to be motivated,
stable, and neurologically healthy.

307
00:11:47,023 --> 00:11:49,101
This machine gives
us a window into all that.

308
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,636
Hmm-mmm. Yeah, you're
gonna be our baseline.

309
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:52,304
So, we're just gonna
show you some pictures,

310
00:11:52,328 --> 00:11:54,568
and all you need
to do is look at them.

311
00:12:00,403 --> 00:12:01,853
Okay, Wilson, you ready?

312
00:12:05,992 --> 00:12:07,691
That's the amygdala, right?

313
00:12:07,761 --> 00:12:09,760
It's fired up by powerful
negative emotions,

314
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:11,440
like fear, rage,
anger, and hate.

315
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:15,366
Okay, now let's take a look
at her nucleus accumbens.

316
00:12:15,435 --> 00:12:17,595
Her pleasure center? Hmm-mmm.

317
00:12:21,024 --> 00:12:23,291
That's not supposed to happen.

318
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,287
Wilson, what's wrong with
you? You don't like cats?

319
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:26,527
Hate 'em.

320
00:12:31,801 --> 00:12:33,651
What's wrong with the beach?

321
00:12:33,719 --> 00:12:36,737
<i>Sand in my eyes, skin cancer,
vacations I never got to take as a child.</i>

322
00:12:36,806 --> 00:12:39,857
Uh-oh. Open comminuted
radius fracture in the ER.

323
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:41,276
There we go. Look at that.

324
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:43,889
Took a broken arm
to make her happy.

325
00:12:43,913 --> 00:12:46,414
I turned her on to ortho a
few weeks ago. Watch this.

326
00:12:46,483 --> 00:12:48,799
Hey, Wilson, you want to
go set that arm yourself?

327
00:12:50,337 --> 00:12:51,552
I love our new toy.

328
00:12:59,262 --> 00:13:02,664
Yang get too fancy for you, kicked
you down here to the "B" team?

329
00:13:02,732 --> 00:13:05,500
Oh, no. I wanted to see
the work you're doing.

330
00:13:07,303 --> 00:13:10,154
Genome sequencing
is the future of medicine.

331
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:13,224
May not be a fancy surgery,
but it's gonna save lives.

332
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:16,744
You want to save lives, or
go to fancy award dinners?

333
00:13:16,812 --> 00:13:18,732
Save lives. Don't get me wrong.

334
00:13:18,765 --> 00:13:21,365
I'm happy for Dr. Yang.
Why wouldn't I be?

335
00:13:21,434 --> 00:13:24,168
I trained her, molded her.

336
00:13:24,237 --> 00:13:25,837
It's almost like it's
my nomination, too.

337
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,183
Keith and Marty are good to go.

338
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:31,358
Yes. Your high-profile
kidney transplant.

339
00:13:31,428 --> 00:13:32,872
I thought you were
harvesting the donor.

340
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:34,306
Yeah, while you do
the award-winning stuff.

341
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:36,163
Yeah, I remember.

342
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:37,982
Page me when you're ready.

343
00:13:39,853 --> 00:13:40,996
Trained her, too.

344
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,387
Thank you so much
for getting back to me.

345
00:13:43,456 --> 00:13:46,991
I hear you're developing a
drug-eluting cardiac pump

346
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:49,127
that's getting excellent
results in sheep.

347
00:13:50,363 --> 00:13:52,430
Yes, that's me.

348
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,658
Well, there are four
other excellent surgeons

349
00:13:54,701 --> 00:13:57,635
who are nominated. Thank you.

350
00:13:57,704 --> 00:14:00,238
Yes. Anyway, I
have a young patient.

351
00:14:00,307 --> 00:14:02,340
He's on day 10 of ECMO

352
00:14:02,408 --> 00:14:04,792
and has a protein S deficiency.

353
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:07,261
Sorry?

354
00:14:08,798 --> 00:14:12,467
I'm 3D printing conduits
for HLHS patients.

355
00:14:12,535 --> 00:14:14,368
Yeah.

356
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:16,649
Well, I think my patient would
be an excellent candidate

357
00:14:16,673 --> 00:14:18,172
for a compassionate release.

358
00:14:19,141 --> 00:14:21,809
In here. I see.

359
00:14:21,877 --> 00:14:23,745
Oh, God. Oh, no, no, no. What?

360
00:14:23,813 --> 00:14:25,290
The little boy's ECMO
circuit clotted off,

361
00:14:25,314 --> 00:14:27,298
and he's not
responding to fluids.

362
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:29,717
Page Dr. Hunt and Dr. Robbins.

363
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:31,063
Okay, let's get
him off that bed...

364
00:14:31,087 --> 00:14:32,986
<i>Dr. Yang?</i>

365
00:14:33,055 --> 00:14:35,423
<i>Dr. Yang, is
everything all right?</i>

366
00:14:35,491 --> 00:14:36,957
<i>Dr. Yang? Hello?</i>

367
00:14:39,261 --> 00:14:40,794
She can't talk right now.

368
00:14:51,274 --> 00:14:53,508
He's clotting, even
on the heparin.

369
00:14:53,576 --> 00:14:54,987
I can't give him any
more or he'll bleed out,

370
00:14:55,011 --> 00:14:57,878
and I can't give him any
less or he'll keep clotting.

371
00:14:57,947 --> 00:15:00,431
We need the
Stanford artificial heart.

372
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:01,593
We can't have it.

373
00:15:01,617 --> 00:15:02,934
What?

374
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:05,203
It's not them. They
want to let us try.

375
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:07,371
It's the FDA.

376
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,641
They're being conservative and
insisting on one more animal trial.

377
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:12,409
They're six months
away from approval.

378
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:13,978
Okay, so what do we do?

379
00:15:14,047 --> 00:15:15,696
We hope UNOS calls.

380
00:15:16,899 --> 00:15:18,566
Today.

381
00:15:18,635 --> 00:15:19,635
Yeah.

382
00:15:29,629 --> 00:15:33,397
Okay, time to get you
prepped and ready for...

383
00:15:35,502 --> 00:15:36,834
I can't do it.

384
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:39,504
Keith's right.

385
00:15:39,572 --> 00:15:42,439
I mean, we've beaten huge odds.

386
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:46,978
We're still alive while so
many of our friends died.

387
00:15:47,046 --> 00:15:50,564
And I've been healthy
for so long now.

388
00:15:50,633 --> 00:15:53,150
You get a little cocky.

389
00:15:53,219 --> 00:15:55,986
You forget how lucky you are.

390
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:57,688
And I...

391
00:15:57,741 --> 00:16:00,574
I'm the most horrible
friend, but I just...

392
00:16:01,277 --> 00:16:02,459
I'm scared.

393
00:16:03,363 --> 00:16:08,166
What if I'm one of the .06%?

394
00:16:08,234 --> 00:16:10,935
I don't think I can
give him my kidney.

395
00:16:12,739 --> 00:16:14,738
Have you told Keith?

396
00:16:16,425 --> 00:16:18,826
He's been suffering for so long,

397
00:16:18,895 --> 00:16:21,763
and when the law was
passed, he was so happy.

398
00:16:21,831 --> 00:16:24,899
And then I turned out
to be a perfect match.

399
00:16:25,468 --> 00:16:27,134
And now...

400
00:16:27,203 --> 00:16:29,836
How can I look my
best friend in the eye

401
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:32,506
and tell him I
won't save his life?

402
00:16:38,214 --> 00:16:41,548
It is unfortunate,
but it does happen.

403
00:16:41,617 --> 00:16:44,385
We misread the
screening, and it turns out

404
00:16:44,453 --> 00:16:47,755
that Marty is not
a suitable donor.

405
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:51,258
I don't understand.

406
00:16:51,327 --> 00:16:53,494
Yeah, this is outrageous.

407
00:16:53,563 --> 00:16:55,813
I'm completely shocked.

408
00:16:55,882 --> 00:16:57,214
So were we.

409
00:16:57,283 --> 00:16:59,650
Shocked and disappointed.

410
00:16:59,719 --> 00:17:01,218
So, what now?

411
00:17:01,287 --> 00:17:03,371
Well, you'll
continue on dialysis

412
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:05,473
and go back on
the transplant list.

413
00:17:07,844 --> 00:17:10,210
You know, it's ironic.

414
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:14,131
I spend years fighting HIV.

415
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,732
I get myself to the point

416
00:17:15,801 --> 00:17:18,820
where the virus is virtually
nonexistent in my body.

417
00:17:19,422 --> 00:17:21,955
I survive.

418
00:17:22,024 --> 00:17:24,035
And now I die of kidney disease.

419
00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:27,895
I'm so sorry. I'm so, so sorry.

420
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:30,531
It's not your fault. You tried.

421
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:32,767
You stepped up.

422
00:17:32,835 --> 00:17:34,201
Oh, God.

423
00:17:34,287 --> 00:17:36,553
I don't know what I
would do without you.

424
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:43,795
What do you do for a living?

425
00:17:43,863 --> 00:17:45,213
<i>I'm an orthopedic surgeon.</i>

426
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:49,761
Do you enjoy
your work? I love it.

427
00:17:49,785 --> 00:17:51,230
<i>Are you married?</i> Yep.

428
00:17:51,254 --> 00:17:53,687
<i>Any kids?</i> One.

429
00:17:53,756 --> 00:17:56,023
Would you consider
yourself a happy person?

430
00:17:56,091 --> 00:17:57,291
Extremely.

431
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,104
<i>And you want to
participate in this project?</i>

432
00:17:59,128 --> 00:18:00,194
I do.

433
00:18:01,297 --> 00:18:02,863
<i>No.</i>

434
00:18:02,931 --> 00:18:04,282
"No," what?

435
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:07,618
<i>Judging by these results,
I'd say you are depressed,</i>

436
00:18:07,686 --> 00:18:09,297
<i>and I would turn you
away from the study.</i>

437
00:18:09,321 --> 00:18:10,721
I'm not depressed.

438
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:12,034
<i>Oh, it's no big deal. We can get</i>

439
00:18:12,058 --> 00:18:13,402
<i>somebody else to
give us a baseline...</i>

440
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:15,666
Derek, I'm not depressed.
Show me the kitten.

441
00:18:19,365 --> 00:18:21,032
Yeah. See?

442
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,366
I'm happy.

443
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:25,119
<i>Am I happy?</i>

444
00:18:25,188 --> 00:18:26,286
<i>Nope.</i>

445
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:27,438
Well...

446
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:29,407
Okay, well...

447
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:31,242
No! Why are you...

448
00:18:32,378 --> 00:18:34,045
I really do love kittens.

449
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,462
I do.

450
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:37,309
Hey, Dr. Torres said you
have a thing for bones.

451
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:39,100
When you're done
with her patient,

452
00:18:39,168 --> 00:18:40,879
you want to do a
mandibular ORIF?

453
00:18:40,903 --> 00:18:42,603
Yes!

454
00:18:42,671 --> 00:18:44,288
I see you have another beverage.

455
00:18:44,357 --> 00:18:45,817
Iced tea, actually.
It's quite good.

456
00:18:45,841 --> 00:18:46,961
Would you like some?

457
00:18:47,026 --> 00:18:48,592
Oh, I'm perfectly
happy with my water.

458
00:18:48,661 --> 00:18:50,077
Is that a...

459
00:18:50,146 --> 00:18:51,529
Her swimsuit. Yeah. Racerback.

460
00:18:51,597 --> 00:18:53,063
I ran out of underwear.

461
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,648
I'm not understanding.

462
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:56,312
You don't wear swimsuits when
you run out of clean underwear?

463
00:18:56,336 --> 00:18:57,813
I don't run out of
clean underwear.

464
00:18:57,837 --> 00:18:59,381
You're a resident. When do
you have time to do laundry?

465
00:18:59,405 --> 00:19:00,821
I'm a doctor. I send it out.

466
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:01,906
Mmm.

467
00:19:04,844 --> 00:19:07,044
The incision looks good.

468
00:19:07,113 --> 00:19:08,546
Where are my parents?

469
00:19:08,615 --> 00:19:10,593
They went to check out
a support group we have

470
00:19:10,617 --> 00:19:12,282
for dealing with tough stuff.

471
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:13,462
I'm the one who's stuck in here.

472
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:14,685
You want to talk about it?

473
00:19:14,754 --> 00:19:15,920
No.

474
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:17,488
Want to play checkers?

475
00:19:17,557 --> 00:19:19,056
No.

476
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:20,224
Chess?

477
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:21,626
No.

478
00:19:21,694 --> 00:19:24,562
Come on. You got to let
me beat you at something.

479
00:19:24,631 --> 00:19:26,964
I kind of feel like playing
with someone my own age.

480
00:19:28,568 --> 00:19:30,928
Whoa! Whoa! Careful. You're
gonna rip through the plastic.

481
00:19:32,772 --> 00:19:34,005
That's the point.

482
00:19:49,172 --> 00:19:51,289
Surgery's off. It's off?

483
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:54,375
Donor backed out.

484
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:57,344
Please tell Cristina
I'm thrilled for her.

485
00:19:57,413 --> 00:19:59,241
I'm sure she'd love
to hear it from you.

486
00:19:59,265 --> 00:20:00,775
And I would love to
have that conversation,

487
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,944
but I am busy
trying to find a way

488
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:06,270
for a gene to proliferate
in the body of a young boy.

489
00:20:06,339 --> 00:20:09,824
So, I would be most
grateful if you would extend

490
00:20:09,892 --> 00:20:13,443
my heartfelt congratulations
to Dr. Yang for me.

491
00:20:17,934 --> 00:20:19,366
Okay.

492
00:20:28,027 --> 00:20:29,460
You said he was stable.

493
00:20:29,529 --> 00:20:31,640
You said he had at least
one more week on ECMO.

494
00:20:31,664 --> 00:20:33,174
We thought that we
had it under control,

495
00:20:33,198 --> 00:20:34,710
and we didn't
expect for him to clot.

496
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:37,434
And six months ago, I
didn't expect any of this.

497
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:39,870
I was in a carpool
line picking up

498
00:20:39,939 --> 00:20:43,040
my three happy,
healthy kids from school.

499
00:20:44,276 --> 00:20:45,509
And now...

500
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:48,446
Now I have two kids in
end-stage heart failure

501
00:20:48,514 --> 00:20:52,015
and one being kept
alive with a pacemaker.

502
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:54,568
You guys can't tell me
why my kids are sick,

503
00:20:54,636 --> 00:20:56,614
and now you're
scratching your heads,

504
00:20:56,638 --> 00:20:59,417
telling me that there's nothing
more you can do for Link except...

505
00:20:59,441 --> 00:21:01,108
Except wait?

506
00:21:01,177 --> 00:21:03,539
I thought you were supposed to
be some award-winning doctor.

507
00:21:03,563 --> 00:21:04,763
Frankie.

508
00:21:04,797 --> 00:21:07,231
My parents keep saying
you're doing your best,

509
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,249
but your best is bad.

510
00:21:09,318 --> 00:21:10,700
Frankie, wait!

511
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,720
Frankie!

512
00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:30,529
Dr. Yang?

513
00:21:31,007 --> 00:21:32,556
I'm an intern here.

514
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:35,192
I just want to say congratulations.
You are totally gonna win.

515
00:21:35,244 --> 00:21:37,156
Are you from the future? No.

516
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:38,779
Then shut up.

517
00:21:38,848 --> 00:21:40,147
She means, "Thank you."

518
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:46,987
Anybody want some meatloaf?

519
00:21:47,056 --> 00:21:48,689
Mmm-mmm.

520
00:21:48,757 --> 00:21:50,386
Isn't that the meatloaf
you had yesterday?

521
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:52,209
Yep. And the day before that.

522
00:21:52,278 --> 00:21:53,756
Probably gonna
have it tomorrow, too,

523
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,173
'cause there's still
a piece left at home.

524
00:21:55,197 --> 00:21:57,197
Jackson doesn't eat
leftovers, you see.

525
00:21:57,266 --> 00:21:58,616
He says he finds it depressing

526
00:21:58,684 --> 00:22:00,529
to eat food out of a
Tupperware container.

527
00:22:00,553 --> 00:22:02,831
You know what I find depressing?
Paying $7 for a hamburger.

528
00:22:02,855 --> 00:22:04,288
Make her stop.

529
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:06,424
Her, too.

530
00:22:07,426 --> 00:22:09,460
Hey.

531
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:11,061
It was low blood
sugar, Shepherd.

532
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:12,874
Take that food to go.
We're gonna do this again.

533
00:22:12,898 --> 00:22:14,581
Come on! Come on! Let's go!

534
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:19,119
There she is.

535
00:22:19,188 --> 00:22:22,356
The future of
medicine. How's it feel?

536
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:24,324
I don't want to talk about it.

537
00:22:24,393 --> 00:22:25,760
Okay.

538
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:29,213
Your mother was the same way.

539
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:33,366
Didn't you have that
meatloaf yesterday?

540
00:22:33,436 --> 00:22:34,513
Uh-huh.

541
00:22:34,537 --> 00:22:35,580
Yep. And the day before that.

542
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:36,882
And probably gonna
have it tomorrow.

543
00:22:36,906 --> 00:22:39,373
Dr. Grey? You're gonna kill me.

544
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:43,994
I'm gonna thank my
parents, obviously.

545
00:22:44,063 --> 00:22:46,546
Why? They didn't help
you win the Harper Avery.

546
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:48,182
They gave birth to me.

547
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:50,417
They should be
publicly acknowledged.

548
00:22:50,485 --> 00:22:51,685
I don't have parents,

549
00:22:51,754 --> 00:22:53,920
so I'm not gonna waste
any of my speech on them.

550
00:22:53,989 --> 00:22:56,924
It's gonna be all about
me. Humble, but...

551
00:22:56,993 --> 00:22:59,059
Self-involved. Exactly.

552
00:22:59,128 --> 00:23:00,160
Can you stop?

553
00:23:00,228 --> 00:23:01,228
What's wrong, Shane?

554
00:23:01,296 --> 00:23:03,463
Swap monkey misses his conduits?

555
00:23:03,532 --> 00:23:05,499
Please. Swap back.

556
00:23:05,585 --> 00:23:07,083
Bailey says she's on the verge.

557
00:23:07,152 --> 00:23:10,521
No, Bailey's been on the
verge for days. I'm keeping Yang.

558
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:12,567
Where is it? What
are you looking for?

559
00:23:12,591 --> 00:23:14,836
I'm looking for a picture
of the Harper Avery.

560
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:17,828
Oh! It's my screen saver.

561
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:19,574
I know what the
Harper Avery looks like.

562
00:23:19,598 --> 00:23:21,410
I'm looking for a picture of
Ellis Grey's Harper Avery.

563
00:23:21,434 --> 00:23:22,666
Why?

564
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:24,062
I remember being
in medical school

565
00:23:24,086 --> 00:23:25,797
and looking at these
old medical journals

566
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:27,198
and seeing a picture of her
from the first time she won.

567
00:23:27,222 --> 00:23:29,489
She was young. She
was like 35 or something.

568
00:23:29,558 --> 00:23:31,638
I'm almost 35. You're 27.

569
00:23:31,693 --> 00:23:33,710
My life is stupid and ordinary.

570
00:23:33,779 --> 00:23:35,357
And I don't even know
what I'm doing here.

571
00:23:35,381 --> 00:23:37,059
I'm never gonna
win a Harper Avery.

572
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:39,750
I might as well just move to
a farm and grow vegetables.

573
00:23:39,819 --> 00:23:41,280
At least I'd be doing
something useful.

574
00:23:41,304 --> 00:23:42,720
Her transplant got canceled.

575
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:43,870
You want to be on Bailey?

576
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:47,457
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

577
00:23:47,526 --> 00:23:49,009
Oh, my God!

578
00:23:50,646 --> 00:23:52,446
Oh! Fries! Yeah!

579
00:23:52,515 --> 00:23:54,481
The surgery is back on?

580
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:55,783
Well, kind of.

581
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:57,829
Marty felt terrible, so
he's back on board.

582
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:59,931
But we told Keith that
they weren't a good match.

583
00:23:59,955 --> 00:24:01,154
You did what?

584
00:24:01,223 --> 00:24:02,751
They're best friends,
and I was trying to help!

585
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:05,542
You got emotionally
involved. Rookie mistake.

586
00:24:05,594 --> 00:24:07,895
I am not a rookie.

587
00:24:07,964 --> 00:24:10,364
But I don't know how I'm
gonna go back and explain this.

588
00:24:10,432 --> 00:24:11,965
Oh, I do.

589
00:24:14,302 --> 00:24:16,904
Dr. Grey misread the labs.

590
00:24:16,972 --> 00:24:19,673
Her relative inexperience
led to a terrible error.

591
00:24:19,742 --> 00:24:22,460
You two are, in
fact, a perfect match.

592
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:23,727
Wow!

593
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:26,180
I mean, this is such great news.

594
00:24:26,249 --> 00:24:28,499
So sorry, Keith.

595
00:24:28,567 --> 00:24:31,007
I'm willing to just put all this
behind me and move forward.

596
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:33,386
Well, you know how
these young surgeons are.

597
00:24:33,455 --> 00:24:37,624
It's all about PR and
awards, and they get sloppy.

598
00:24:37,693 --> 00:24:39,993
He said he's ready
to move forward.

599
00:24:40,062 --> 00:24:42,613
Luckily, I'm available
to do your transplant,

600
00:24:42,681 --> 00:24:46,483
and I assure you I am
substance over flash.

601
00:24:46,552 --> 00:24:48,752
I thought you were
doing Marty's surgery.

602
00:24:48,821 --> 00:24:51,655
Well, I don't mind
taking Dr. Grey.

603
00:24:51,724 --> 00:24:53,323
Well, why should you settle?

604
00:24:53,392 --> 00:24:55,943
Well, she's, you know,
just taking out my kidney.

605
00:24:56,028 --> 00:24:57,360
How hard could it be, you know?

606
00:24:57,429 --> 00:24:58,707
But she can barely
read a lab report.

607
00:24:58,731 --> 00:25:00,191
You don't know if
she's gonna mistake

608
00:25:00,215 --> 00:25:01,614
your gallbladder
for your kidney.

609
00:25:01,683 --> 00:25:05,252
Guys, I assure you,
I'm an excellent surgeon.

610
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:07,988
Why don't I get another
doctor to do Marty's surgery?

611
00:25:08,541 --> 00:25:09,873
What?

612
00:25:11,577 --> 00:25:13,227
A good idea.

613
00:25:14,096 --> 00:25:15,979
Yes. Yes.

614
00:25:16,048 --> 00:25:17,080
Thank you.

615
00:25:17,149 --> 00:25:18,149
Yes.

616
00:25:19,368 --> 00:25:20,867
Listen, we need this device.

617
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:23,816
This will buy the kid time
until a heart becomes available.

618
00:25:23,872 --> 00:25:26,140
That's crap! You're the
FDA! You make the rules!

619
00:25:26,208 --> 00:25:30,677
I just set a broken radius and
assisted on a mandibular ORIF.

620
00:25:30,746 --> 00:25:32,146
How great is this day?

621
00:25:32,214 --> 00:25:34,126
My kid's trapped in a
bubble for the rest of his life.

622
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:36,428
You and Bailey will figure it
out. That's how great this day is.

623
00:25:36,452 --> 00:25:39,419
Imagination and
innovation are everywhere.

624
00:25:39,488 --> 00:25:41,154
I'm seeing a lot of
misery and failure.

625
00:25:41,223 --> 00:25:42,673
Alex.

626
00:25:42,742 --> 00:25:43,985
Should I take the
private-practice job?

627
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:45,436
I thought you'd already decided

628
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,754
that you were gonna
call Dr. Butthole and...

629
00:25:46,778 --> 00:25:48,523
So Yang's winning
awards, and I'm selling out?

630
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:50,676
You're not a sellout for taking a
job doing something that you love.

631
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:52,366
Private practice
was never the plan.

632
00:25:52,435 --> 00:25:53,745
It was never supposed
to be about the money.

633
00:25:53,769 --> 00:25:55,797
Well, there's nothing
wrong with making money.

634
00:25:55,821 --> 00:25:58,755
What am I gonna buy? A
condo in Aspen? I don't even ski.

635
00:25:58,824 --> 00:26:00,535
Not everyone
who's rich is an ass.

636
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,879
You could take the
job and not be an ass.

637
00:26:05,398 --> 00:26:06,997
Braden? Braden!

638
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:08,799
Braden! Braden, where are you?

639
00:26:08,868 --> 00:26:10,746
Where is he? Where is
my son? We can't find him!

640
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:12,135
Braden!

641
00:26:12,204 --> 00:26:14,370
Watch it!

642
00:26:14,439 --> 00:26:15,917
I'm gonna get
you! No, you're not!

643
00:26:15,941 --> 00:26:17,540
No running in the halls.

644
00:26:26,452 --> 00:26:27,484
Come here!

645
00:26:27,536 --> 00:26:29,336
I got you! No, you didn't!

646
00:26:29,405 --> 00:26:30,437
You're totally it.

647
00:26:30,506 --> 00:26:32,384
Frankie! Don't
touch him! Braden!

648
00:26:32,408 --> 00:26:33,584
You can't. He's
immuno-compromised.

649
00:26:33,608 --> 00:26:34,708
Any more exposure,

650
00:26:34,793 --> 00:26:37,110
even breathing on
him, puts him at risk.

651
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:38,939
Can everyone please
step away from the boy?

652
00:26:53,378 --> 00:26:55,156
It's okay, son. Don't
worry. Brady bug,

653
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,413
we love you.

654
00:26:56,482 --> 00:26:57,648
It's okay, son, all right?

655
00:26:57,716 --> 00:26:59,161
Don't worry. Don't worry.

656
00:26:59,185 --> 00:27:00,366
We're gonna be right here.

657
00:27:00,435 --> 00:27:02,213
You're so strong. We're
not going anywhere.

658
00:27:02,237 --> 00:27:03,369
Don't worry.

659
00:27:03,438 --> 00:27:04,649
Mommy and Daddy are here, okay?

660
00:27:04,673 --> 00:27:05,806
We're right here, son.

661
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:07,340
Don't worry.

662
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:10,310
Braden told me he was fine.

663
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,445
Mom...

664
00:27:13,348 --> 00:27:14,632
Is Link gonna die?

665
00:27:19,705 --> 00:27:20,971
I hope not.

666
00:27:22,141 --> 00:27:23,707
But he's really sick.

667
00:27:23,775 --> 00:27:26,335
He's even worse than Ivy was, and
you remember how bad she was?

668
00:27:28,697 --> 00:27:29,913
What?

669
00:27:29,965 --> 00:27:31,965
I have some good news.

670
00:27:32,033 --> 00:27:33,650
It was a no. It was a hard no.

671
00:27:33,719 --> 00:27:35,986
And then I realized
that Frankie was right.

672
00:27:36,055 --> 00:27:37,654
You are a big-time doctor.

673
00:27:37,723 --> 00:27:39,834
So I told them that you were
about to win a Harper Avery.

674
00:27:39,858 --> 00:27:41,858
They placed the cardiac
pumps in 10 sheep hearts,

675
00:27:41,894 --> 00:27:43,760
and 9 out of the 10
worked without clotting.

676
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:45,362
It's brilliant.

677
00:27:45,431 --> 00:27:47,042
They put me on hold, and then
came back a few minutes later

678
00:27:47,066 --> 00:27:48,932
and said okay.

679
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:51,668
Just like that... Boom.
Suddenly, you have clout.

680
00:27:51,737 --> 00:27:53,537
Suddenly, you
can get things done.

681
00:27:53,605 --> 00:27:54,788
Using the sheep was perfect.

682
00:27:54,857 --> 00:27:56,790
Their hearts are about
the same size as Link's.

683
00:27:56,859 --> 00:27:58,125
Parents signed consent.

684
00:27:58,194 --> 00:27:59,604
They put the device
on the next plane.

685
00:27:59,628 --> 00:28:01,578
I got Wilson coordinating
with the airlines.

686
00:28:01,646 --> 00:28:04,848
How the hell did you talk
the FDA into doing that?

687
00:28:04,917 --> 00:28:06,232
You're not gonna believe this.

688
00:28:06,301 --> 00:28:08,668
Okay. It was a no. It
was a hard no. And then...

689
00:28:08,737 --> 00:28:10,270
Quiet! Please!

690
00:28:10,339 --> 00:28:12,484
I've got about four hours to
get through all their research.

691
00:28:12,508 --> 00:28:14,108
Can you please take
the party outside?

692
00:28:14,176 --> 00:28:16,388
San Francisco's fogged in. They've
grounded all commercial flights

693
00:28:16,412 --> 00:28:17,932
for at least another
couple of hours.

694
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:19,245
Well, he's getting worse.

695
00:28:19,314 --> 00:28:21,660
I don't think that he
has that kind of time.

696
00:28:21,684 --> 00:28:23,099
Let's go.

697
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:25,235
Ross will transport the
kidney once I take it out,

698
00:28:25,303 --> 00:28:26,881
and then you'll join
me for the transfer.

699
00:28:26,905 --> 00:28:28,238
Roger that.

700
00:28:28,306 --> 00:28:29,823
You okay, Ross? You got this?

701
00:28:29,891 --> 00:28:31,358
Ross!

702
00:28:31,427 --> 00:28:33,371
Swap monkey. You can
have your conduits back.

703
00:28:33,395 --> 00:28:34,761
I'm good.

704
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:36,096
No. Hey! I called swap monkey.

705
00:28:36,164 --> 00:28:37,942
Don't you go into that
OR. Don't you dare!

706
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:39,232
Too late!

707
00:28:39,301 --> 00:28:40,567
Damn it, Ross.

708
00:28:42,771 --> 00:28:44,737
Hi. I was...

709
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:47,407
Never mind.

710
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:51,145
What's a swap monkey?

711
00:28:51,213 --> 00:28:53,913
It's when you want
what someone else has.

712
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:55,476
San Jose airport's
open. There's a

713
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,911
flight that connects
through Portland.

714
00:28:56,935 --> 00:28:58,379
It can be here in six
hours. That's still too long.

715
00:28:58,403 --> 00:28:59,513
I'm telling you, private charter

716
00:28:59,537 --> 00:29:00,581
is the only way this will work.

717
00:29:00,605 --> 00:29:01,716
Yeah, Richie
Rich, you said that.

718
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,640
I got one! A private jet.

719
00:29:03,708 --> 00:29:04,941
It's fueled and ready

720
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:06,121
and on the tarmac or
whatever. Yeah, yeah!

721
00:29:06,145 --> 00:29:07,388
Okay! Okay! Get it! Get it!

722
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:08,857
Yes, very interested.
What would...

723
00:29:08,881 --> 00:29:10,647
It's $25,000.

724
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:12,761
So, who pays for that?

725
00:29:12,785 --> 00:29:14,062
No, we need board
approval for that one.

726
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:15,185
You're the board!

727
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:16,530
Well, you call an
emergency board meeting

728
00:29:16,554 --> 00:29:17,766
because we have to! Come on!

729
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:19,089
We got to do it!

730
00:29:19,158 --> 00:29:20,507
Just use this, okay?

731
00:29:20,576 --> 00:29:21,825
Put it on my card.

732
00:29:21,894 --> 00:29:24,128
I'll sort it out with the
board later. It's fine.

733
00:29:24,196 --> 00:29:25,245
Thank you, Jackson.

734
00:29:25,314 --> 00:29:26,746
Yeah, thanks.

735
00:29:26,815 --> 00:29:30,199
Okay, Amex. 3768...

736
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:34,349
It was the night that
UDub made it into the finals.

737
00:29:34,373 --> 00:29:37,474
This poor freshman fell
when blocking a three-pointer.

738
00:29:37,543 --> 00:29:40,610
It was such a freak injury. The
tibia was shattered in two places,

739
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:44,248
the bone was sticking
out six inches from the skin.

740
00:29:44,316 --> 00:29:45,765
It was totally disgusting.

741
00:29:45,834 --> 00:29:48,935
But I assisted the
attending in the OR,

742
00:29:49,004 --> 00:29:51,216
placing the rod and the screws.

743
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,467
It probably took,
like, seven hours.

744
00:29:53,491 --> 00:29:55,358
I fell in love.

745
00:29:55,427 --> 00:29:56,759
It was ortho all the way.

746
00:29:59,698 --> 00:30:01,776
<i>Yeah, look, Callie, I know
you don't want to hear this, but...</i>

747
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,500
Oh, come on! Nothing?

748
00:30:04,402 --> 00:30:05,702
<i>A lot of people are depressed.</i>

749
00:30:05,771 --> 00:30:07,421
<i>I'm a happy person!</i>

750
00:30:07,489 --> 00:30:09,506
I have a number for
you. This guy's great.

751
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:11,503
He helped me through
a really difficult time.

752
00:30:11,527 --> 00:30:13,938
<i>My life is perfect. I'm
married to an amazing woman.</i>

753
00:30:13,962 --> 00:30:15,890
We're raising an
adorable little girl.

754
00:30:15,914 --> 00:30:17,992
I'm at the forefront of
groundbreaking medical technology

755
00:30:18,016 --> 00:30:19,516
with robotic limbs.

756
00:30:19,584 --> 00:30:20,996
Not to mention, I'm a homeowner.

757
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:23,287
I mean, do any of these
things sound depressing to you?

758
00:30:23,355 --> 00:30:25,636
<i>Maybe your stupid,
fancy machine's broken.</i>

759
00:30:26,141 --> 00:30:27,618
<i>Hey. Hey!</i>

760
00:30:27,642 --> 00:30:29,543
<i>I got thrown off my surgery,</i>

761
00:30:29,611 --> 00:30:32,145
so Bailey and I decided
to come visit Daddy.

762
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:35,098
Hi.

763
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:37,379
I think you have a
crush on my wife.

764
00:30:37,403 --> 00:30:39,723
Meredith walked in, and
your pleasure center just lit up.

765
00:30:40,489 --> 00:30:41,838
It's still lit.

766
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:48,661
Nope.

767
00:30:49,865 --> 00:30:51,531
<i>It's not Meredith.</i>

768
00:30:58,407 --> 00:30:59,573
I didn't see you

769
00:30:59,641 --> 00:31:01,786
at the champagne toast
this morning for Yang.

770
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:02,909
I had rounds.

771
00:31:03,579 --> 00:31:04,811
Mmm-hmm.

772
00:31:06,381 --> 00:31:07,880
Jealous?

773
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:09,949
Of Yang?

774
00:31:10,018 --> 00:31:11,258
Don't let it eat at you.

775
00:31:12,187 --> 00:31:14,421
Vascular clamp.

776
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:17,357
When Ellis won, it ate at me.

777
00:31:17,426 --> 00:31:19,270
Didn't make me a better surgeon.

778
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:20,505
Made me a jealous one.

779
00:31:20,529 --> 00:31:21,628
I'm not jealous!

780
00:31:23,332 --> 00:31:26,899
Okay, I'm jealous. Happy
now? Therapy's over.

781
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:29,185
Not enough length
on the right renal vein.

782
00:31:29,255 --> 00:31:31,421
We'll need to mobilize it.

783
00:31:31,489 --> 00:31:35,125
Bailey, you have
your genome lab work.

784
00:31:35,194 --> 00:31:37,961
The things you could do,
the lives you can save...

785
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:39,207
That's award-winning.

786
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:41,031
Do they give awards to
people who are stuck?

787
00:31:43,802 --> 00:31:47,470
That poor boy spends the
rest of his life in a bubble

788
00:31:47,539 --> 00:31:49,990
if I can't figure out
how to fix his mutation,

789
00:31:50,058 --> 00:31:52,125
and I've been staring at
the research for weeks.

790
00:31:55,364 --> 00:31:59,015
Anastomosing the
external iliac, 5-0 prolene.

791
00:32:02,171 --> 00:32:03,771
Hey! Out of the way!

792
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:13,463
Medevac with the device
just touched down on the roof.

793
00:32:13,532 --> 00:32:14,765
What'd I miss?

794
00:32:14,833 --> 00:32:16,633
Yang's going over the
procedure in her head.

795
00:32:21,089 --> 00:32:22,800
She's so cool. She's amazing.

796
00:32:22,824 --> 00:32:24,201
She's totally gonna
win the Harper Avery.

797
00:32:24,225 --> 00:32:25,525
And we know her.

798
00:32:25,594 --> 00:32:27,827
I printed one of her
sample conduits.

799
00:32:27,896 --> 00:32:29,006
For the rest of my
life, I get to say that.

800
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,063
What's she doing?

801
00:32:30,131 --> 00:32:31,898
Being amazing.
She's poetry in motion.

802
00:32:31,966 --> 00:32:34,667
<i>Meredith, can you
turn off the intercom?</i>

803
00:33:09,521 --> 00:33:12,572
The kidney's pinking
up. That's just beautiful.

804
00:33:14,526 --> 00:33:16,886
What do you mean...

805
00:33:16,962 --> 00:33:20,230
We just transplanted
an HIV-positive organ,

806
00:33:20,299 --> 00:33:22,060
and you're making a mopey face?

807
00:33:22,084 --> 00:33:24,145
I remember when HIV baffled us.

808
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:26,213
I mean, the way it could
make its way into cells,

809
00:33:26,237 --> 00:33:29,455
replicate its DNA. I mean,
the perfectly designed virus.

810
00:33:29,524 --> 00:33:32,009
I understand how HIV works.

811
00:33:32,077 --> 00:33:34,628
We never thought we'd
find anything close to a cure.

812
00:33:34,696 --> 00:33:36,029
And now look at Keith.

813
00:33:36,999 --> 00:33:38,598
He's alive.

814
00:33:38,667 --> 00:33:39,966
He's full of T cells.

815
00:33:40,034 --> 00:33:44,120
He just received a
kidney transplant. From us.

816
00:33:44,189 --> 00:33:46,723
We do this marvelous
thing, I'm trying to enjoy it,

817
00:33:46,791 --> 00:33:48,031
and you're bringing me down.

818
00:33:48,093 --> 00:33:49,993
I understand how HIV works.

819
00:33:50,062 --> 00:33:52,829
Yeah, you just said that.
Let's just close the patient.

820
00:33:52,898 --> 00:33:55,543
I need to be around some
sunshine, not rain clouds.

821
00:33:55,567 --> 00:33:58,935
No, no. It's a perfectly
designed virus.

822
00:33:59,004 --> 00:34:03,106
HIV has a brilliant
transport system.

823
00:34:03,175 --> 00:34:05,608
The mechanisms it uses, it...

824
00:34:06,644 --> 00:34:09,145
If I could deactivate it...

825
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,000
Okay, I need to read

826
00:34:14,069 --> 00:34:18,388
everything on gene
therapy and virus vectors.

827
00:34:18,457 --> 00:34:20,774
I need stem cells. I need
to get down to my lab.

828
00:34:20,842 --> 00:34:22,525
I need a mocha latte!

829
00:34:22,594 --> 00:34:24,005
Okay, well, go.
I'll close up. Go.

830
00:34:24,029 --> 00:34:25,612
Go now! Okay.

831
00:34:29,634 --> 00:34:30,717
What'd I miss?

832
00:34:33,021 --> 00:34:34,220
The pow.

833
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,926
I'm gonna start here

834
00:34:39,995 --> 00:34:42,428
to leave a rim of ventricle
to sew the pump to.

835
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:44,597
Good idea.

836
00:34:44,666 --> 00:34:46,783
Hey, have you googled
any of the other nominees?

837
00:34:47,886 --> 00:34:49,402
No. I have.

838
00:34:50,438 --> 00:34:51,549
You want to know what I think?

839
00:34:51,573 --> 00:34:52,573
No.

840
00:34:58,113 --> 00:35:00,580
Excuse me. Sorry.
Pardon me. Excuse me, sir.

841
00:35:00,649 --> 00:35:02,015
Excuse me.

842
00:35:05,787 --> 00:35:06,964
No one would even know

843
00:35:06,988 --> 00:35:08,828
that you're seething
with jealousy right now.

844
00:35:10,258 --> 00:35:13,292
I'm not seething. I
am happy for her.

845
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:16,228
Right. I have a machine
that will confirm seething.

846
00:35:20,602 --> 00:35:22,936
I wore waterproof mascara
today because I was sure

847
00:35:23,004 --> 00:35:25,550
I wouldn't make it through
the day without crying.

848
00:35:25,574 --> 00:35:27,451
And if anybody
saw me, I would say

849
00:35:27,475 --> 00:35:29,353
that I was crying
because I'm happy for her.

850
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:31,878
And they would
believe me because...

851
00:35:31,947 --> 00:35:35,214
Does a jealous friend
plan a champagne toast?

852
00:35:38,337 --> 00:35:41,771
You planned a champagne
toast to cover up your jealousy?

853
00:35:42,441 --> 00:35:43,940
You're a genius.

854
00:35:44,009 --> 00:35:46,276
You should call the
Harper Avery people.

855
00:35:46,345 --> 00:35:48,005
Tell them. Maybe
they'll give me an award.

856
00:35:48,029 --> 00:35:49,128
Hmm.

857
00:35:53,768 --> 00:35:57,704
I just strapped the camera
to the top, and check this out.

858
00:35:57,772 --> 00:35:59,417
You can see where
you're going on your tablet,

859
00:35:59,441 --> 00:36:00,681
and you can talk to anyone.

860
00:36:02,744 --> 00:36:03,922
Look, I know it's
not what you wanted.

861
00:36:03,946 --> 00:36:05,690
It's awesome!
How far does it go?

862
00:36:05,714 --> 00:36:08,342
Two hundred yards. That'll
cover the whole peds floor.

863
00:36:08,366 --> 00:36:09,577
You can visit your girlfriend.

864
00:36:09,601 --> 00:36:10,683
She's not my girlfriend!

865
00:36:14,522 --> 00:36:16,856
Yang's done. Surgery
was a success.

866
00:36:16,924 --> 00:36:18,824
Cool. Did you make that?

867
00:36:18,893 --> 00:36:20,727
Well, it's a $10 solution.

868
00:36:20,795 --> 00:36:21,961
I think it's great.

869
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:24,510
Well, money lets you
do good crap in the world.

870
00:36:26,251 --> 00:36:27,484
Oh, my God.

871
00:36:27,552 --> 00:36:28,868
You called Butthole.

872
00:36:28,937 --> 00:36:30,737
Yeah. Well, I told
him I was interested.

873
00:36:40,598 --> 00:36:41,781
Yang?

874
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:44,984
Congratulations
on the Harper Avery.

875
00:36:46,054 --> 00:36:47,370
Just a nomination.

876
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:50,439
Cristina Yang!

877
00:36:50,508 --> 00:36:52,308
I taught you better than that.

878
00:36:52,377 --> 00:36:54,210
When someone congratulates you,

879
00:36:54,279 --> 00:36:58,081
you look them in the eye and
smile and say, "Thank you."

880
00:37:00,869 --> 00:37:02,435
Thank you, Dr. Bailey.

881
00:37:03,738 --> 00:37:05,605
You're welcome, Dr. Yang.

882
00:37:16,985 --> 00:37:19,352
Kidney function is excellent.
Urine output is good.

883
00:37:19,421 --> 00:37:21,121
Well, that's some
history-making urine.

884
00:37:21,189 --> 00:37:22,755
Swap monkey, Shane.

885
00:37:22,824 --> 00:37:25,024
I think I'll go back down
to Dr. Bailey's genome lab.

886
00:37:25,092 --> 00:37:26,693
Oh, now you want in.

887
00:37:26,762 --> 00:37:28,227
She's mine.

888
00:37:28,296 --> 00:37:30,376
No. You go deal
with your conduits.

889
00:37:31,767 --> 00:37:33,249
Ross!

890
00:37:33,318 --> 00:37:35,129
Oh, Dr. Webber, I'm looking
for a picture of Ellis Grey

891
00:37:35,153 --> 00:37:37,119
with her first Harper Avery.

892
00:37:37,188 --> 00:37:39,000
Do you remember
what year it was?

893
00:37:39,024 --> 00:37:40,223
1988.

894
00:37:41,176 --> 00:37:42,541
Hey, you want to see?

895
00:37:53,004 --> 00:37:54,004
Wow.

896
00:37:55,873 --> 00:37:57,390
She looks so happy.

897
00:37:57,475 --> 00:37:59,742
Yeah. She was happy.

898
00:38:00,678 --> 00:38:02,512
It was a great night.

899
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:07,567
It was a great night.

900
00:38:13,074 --> 00:38:17,126
So far, there's no evidence of
clotting, and his pump is working well.

901
00:38:17,195 --> 00:38:18,694
He's doing really great.

902
00:38:18,763 --> 00:38:20,942
We're gonna keep him
sedated for about 24 hours,

903
00:38:20,966 --> 00:38:22,465
and then slowly wake him up.

904
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:26,202
Thank you all so much.

905
00:38:26,271 --> 00:38:28,654
I'm sorry that we doubted you.

906
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:30,223
We shouldn't have.

907
00:38:31,827 --> 00:38:34,344
Doubt is normal. Get some rest.

908
00:38:57,218 --> 00:38:58,751
I have clean underwear?

909
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:01,520
I'm gonna cry.
You're making me cry.

910
00:39:04,059 --> 00:39:06,459
Don't be surprised
when you see a charge

911
00:39:06,527 --> 00:39:09,696
for, like, $25,000
on the credit card.

912
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:10,830
What?

913
00:39:10,899 --> 00:39:12,677
Yeah, you know
how earlier I said

914
00:39:12,701 --> 00:39:15,134
I don't spend my money on
hookers and private planes?

915
00:39:15,203 --> 00:39:17,198
I guess, like,
technically, I was lying.

916
00:39:17,222 --> 00:39:19,121
You spent $25,000 on...

917
00:39:19,191 --> 00:39:20,417
On an airplane, okay?

918
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:22,592
For Cristina's experimental
heart to get here.

919
00:39:22,644 --> 00:39:24,354
And the board is
gonna reimburse me.

920
00:39:24,378 --> 00:39:26,312
Who even has a
credit limit that high?

921
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:27,647
Turns out I do.

922
00:39:27,716 --> 00:39:29,732
I feel a little sick.

923
00:39:29,801 --> 00:39:33,303
Your credit limit and
trust fund and $4 lattes

924
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:35,638
are literally just
making me feel sick.

925
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:38,007
Eat some three-day-old lasagna.

926
00:39:38,076 --> 00:39:39,316
That'll make you feel better.

927
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:50,519
Hey. Hi. I didn't know
that you were waiting.

928
00:39:53,324 --> 00:39:54,573
You're gonna kill me.

929
00:39:54,643 --> 00:39:55,643
Why?

930
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:56,776
You are.

931
00:39:56,844 --> 00:39:59,195
Oh, my God. I can't
believe I'm even...

932
00:39:59,264 --> 00:40:00,524
Did you sleep with someone else?

933
00:40:00,548 --> 00:40:02,215
What? No!

934
00:40:02,284 --> 00:40:03,767
Thank God. You scared me.

935
00:40:03,835 --> 00:40:05,502
I want another baby.

936
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:06,570
What?

937
00:40:06,638 --> 00:40:07,915
Look, I want my life back, too,

938
00:40:07,939 --> 00:40:09,917
and I want time to have
a thought and do my work.

939
00:40:09,941 --> 00:40:11,540
But I also...

940
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:12,853
Wait... Why on
Earth would you think

941
00:40:12,877 --> 00:40:14,038
I would sleep with someone else?

942
00:40:14,062 --> 00:40:15,239
Because you said that
I was gonna kill you.

943
00:40:15,263 --> 00:40:16,607
After everything that
we've been through,

944
00:40:16,631 --> 00:40:18,681
how you could ever,
even for one second,

945
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:20,478
think that I would sleep
with someone else is crazy.

946
00:40:20,502 --> 00:40:22,301
I want another baby, too.

947
00:40:22,370 --> 00:40:23,686
What?

948
00:40:23,755 --> 00:40:27,056
I don't want Sofia
to bury us alone

949
00:40:27,125 --> 00:40:29,954
or nurse us through some
horrible, long decline by herself.

950
00:40:29,978 --> 00:40:32,022
She should go through
that with someone else.

951
00:40:32,046 --> 00:40:33,429
That's morbid and awful.

952
00:40:33,498 --> 00:40:34,675
Or practical.

953
00:40:34,699 --> 00:40:36,098
And awful.

954
00:40:36,167 --> 00:40:37,745
Well, you want
another baby, too.

955
00:40:37,769 --> 00:40:39,747
Yeah, because I love babies.
They're adorable and delicious.

956
00:40:39,771 --> 00:40:42,104
And you just realized
that this afternoon?

957
00:40:42,173 --> 00:40:44,418
Yeah, I forgot. And then I saw
Meredith and her baby, and...

958
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:46,075
Wait. Why are we arguing?

959
00:40:51,032 --> 00:40:52,364
We're gonna have another baby.

960
00:40:53,635 --> 00:40:54,767
We are.

961
00:40:55,503 --> 00:40:56,836
I love you so much.

962
00:40:56,905 --> 00:40:58,204
I love you so, so much.

963
00:40:58,273 --> 00:41:00,123
We're having another baby!

964
00:41:00,191 --> 00:41:01,840
<i>My mom didn't think she'd win.</i>

965
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:05,260
<i>She thought it was
a popularity contest,</i>

966
00:41:05,329 --> 00:41:07,062
<i>and she wasn't popular.</i>

967
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:08,731
<i>She was a woman and a fellow,</i>

968
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:12,768
<i>and her arrogance could
rub people the wrong way.</i>

969
00:41:12,837 --> 00:41:15,705
<i>She hadn't allowed herself to
imagine the possibility of winning</i>

970
00:41:15,773 --> 00:41:18,007
<i>because she wanted it too much.</i>

971
00:41:19,243 --> 00:41:21,811
You know, I have looked
at the other nominees.

972
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,413
I've seen their research.

973
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:25,415
Me, too. What? Really?

974
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:29,418
Yes, I looked at everyone's
abstracts and read their articles.

975
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:32,154
I even called a friend
over at Chicago Children's

976
00:41:32,223 --> 00:41:34,602
who knows Lucas... You
know, whatever his name is...

977
00:41:34,626 --> 00:41:37,104
Who's doing the work on the
ligature tissue-sealing device,

978
00:41:37,128 --> 00:41:38,368
which is kind of...

979
00:41:38,429 --> 00:41:40,329
Derivative. Right? Right?

980
00:41:40,398 --> 00:41:43,243
And supposedly, his trial
patients are not doing well.

981
00:41:43,267 --> 00:41:46,168
Which is bad,
obviously, but also...

982
00:41:46,237 --> 00:41:47,904
I think you're gonna win.

983
00:41:47,972 --> 00:41:51,407
<i>And when they called my mom's
name, she was genuinely shocked.</i>

984
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:56,779
<i>It was validation of all
her hard work and sacrifice.</i>

985
00:41:56,848 --> 00:41:58,047
I really do.

986
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:02,035
I think you are going to win.

987
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:04,671
Me, too.

988
00:42:04,739 --> 00:42:07,390
<i>She came home and told me
she didn't win the Harper Avery.</i>

989
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:09,692
<i>She earned it.</i>
