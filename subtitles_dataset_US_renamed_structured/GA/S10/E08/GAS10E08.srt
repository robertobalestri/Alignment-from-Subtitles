1
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:07,239
<i>Glioma, fibroma, blastoma.</i>

2
00:00:07,308 --> 00:00:08,507
<i>Whatever the tumor,</i>

3
00:00:08,575 --> 00:00:10,809
<i>people assume you
approach it the same way.</i>

4
00:00:10,878 --> 00:00:13,012
<i>You find its hiding
place in the body,</i>

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,480
<i>then open the patient up...</i>

6
00:00:14,548 --> 00:00:17,115
Miranda. Miranda, what
are you doing? It's 4:00 a.m.

7
00:00:17,167 --> 00:00:20,869
There's a smell.

8
00:00:21,605 --> 00:00:23,371
Something rotting.

9
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,557
I smell nothing.

10
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:28,838
I know my son. Before
leaving for his dad's,

11
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:33,665
he left a piece of
food somewhere.

12
00:00:33,733 --> 00:00:35,567
Hey, let's go back to
bed, get some sleep.

13
00:00:35,635 --> 00:00:37,119
Tomorrow's a big day.

14
00:00:37,187 --> 00:00:38,531
You're going back
to your old job.

15
00:00:38,555 --> 00:00:40,873
Can't you do that in your sleep?

16
00:00:40,941 --> 00:00:42,719
You want me to help you look?

17
00:00:42,743 --> 00:00:46,383
How can you help if you
can't even smell the smell?

18
00:00:48,065 --> 00:00:49,985
<i>And you cut it the hell out.</i>

19
00:00:53,604 --> 00:00:56,705
<i>But you're not just
fighting the one tumor.</i>

20
00:01:02,078 --> 00:01:03,378
Dude, you're Jago.

21
00:01:03,447 --> 00:01:04,908
Counter with a wind
kick. It'll take him down.

22
00:01:04,932 --> 00:01:07,966
I can't concentrate
when you watch me.

23
00:01:08,035 --> 00:01:10,368
What are you even doing awake?

24
00:01:10,438 --> 00:01:12,382
Are you worried about
your surgery tomorrow?

25
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:13,739
Nope.

26
00:01:13,808 --> 00:01:17,609
Can't sleep because of
the crying baby next door.

27
00:01:17,678 --> 00:01:20,779
And the frog and the monkey
picture kind of freak me out.

28
00:01:22,316 --> 00:01:23,476
Hey, is this level seven?

29
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,368
Yep. What about you?
Shouldn't you be resting

30
00:01:26,436 --> 00:01:28,356
before you and Dr. Grey
operate on me tomorrow?

31
00:01:28,389 --> 00:01:30,767
Video games are good for
surgical practice. Give me that.

32
00:01:30,791 --> 00:01:33,392
I'll show you how
to beat Sabrewulf.

33
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:36,511
<i>You're actually at war
with over a billion cells.</i>

34
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:38,946
<i>Combo!</i>

35
00:01:39,016 --> 00:01:41,467
Nice. Told you.

36
00:01:43,787 --> 00:01:45,153
Dr. Grey?

37
00:01:45,222 --> 00:01:46,421
Huh?

38
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:50,587
You wanted me to
wake you if, um...

39
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:52,027
How is it?

40
00:01:52,096 --> 00:01:54,456
It's starting to have a shape.

41
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:56,272
Come look.

42
00:02:05,575 --> 00:02:08,638
So there we were, hour
four into this messy trauma,

43
00:02:08,662 --> 00:02:11,241
when I say, "That's not an
adhesion, that's the ureter."

44
00:02:11,265 --> 00:02:12,509
You guys... Shh!

45
00:02:12,533 --> 00:02:13,627
I'm telling a story here.

46
00:02:13,651 --> 00:02:14,900
Um... Oh, uh, creamer.

47
00:02:16,036 --> 00:02:17,669
You said it to the attending?

48
00:02:17,738 --> 00:02:19,749
Yeah, he blew me off. He
didn't stop what he was doing

49
00:02:19,773 --> 00:02:22,452
until the chief resident
invoked the two-challenge rule.

50
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:23,575
You guys...

51
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,288
It comes from aviation.
Say I'm the pilot,

52
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:27,361
and you're my co-pilot.

53
00:02:27,431 --> 00:02:28,942
You disagree with
how I'm flying the plane.

54
00:02:28,966 --> 00:02:30,059
Okay, you say something,

55
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:31,895
and I fly the plane
the same way.

56
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:35,387
Someone else says something,
and I don't acknowledge it,

57
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:37,167
I lose. I have to
give up control.

58
00:02:37,191 --> 00:02:38,790
The two-challenge rule.

59
00:02:38,858 --> 00:02:40,938
I mean, the doctors
adopted it to the OR.

60
00:02:44,148 --> 00:02:45,680
Edwards, what?

61
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:47,182
We're 30 minutes away.

62
00:02:47,251 --> 00:02:48,616
Finish your rounds.

63
00:02:48,685 --> 00:02:50,764
You're gonna wanna be in the
front row when your life changes.

64
00:02:50,788 --> 00:02:52,308
Yeah. I'm ready.

65
00:02:53,707 --> 00:02:55,185
Dr. Webber, you
want to come with us?

66
00:02:55,209 --> 00:02:57,153
Dr. Grey says you're
supposed to be up and walking.

67
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,177
Uh, no, you go on down.

68
00:02:59,246 --> 00:03:00,545
Uh, but come back,

69
00:03:00,614 --> 00:03:02,774
'cause you're gonna wanna
hear the end of this story.

70
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,467
Everyone knows
the end of the story,

71
00:03:05,536 --> 00:03:07,469
because you've already told it!

72
00:03:07,538 --> 00:03:09,549
Maybe you shouldn't be
listening in on conversations

73
00:03:09,573 --> 00:03:12,040
that take place in other
people's rooms, C.J.

74
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:15,076
Not my fault that
you work for a hospital

75
00:03:15,145 --> 00:03:16,410
with crap-thin walls!

76
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:17,719
Yeah, go take a lap!

77
00:03:17,781 --> 00:03:20,933
I will if you do!

78
00:03:25,356 --> 00:03:26,532
Hey, guys!

79
00:03:26,556 --> 00:03:28,056
Hey! Hey!

80
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:30,070
So I have the results
of your compatibility test.

81
00:03:30,094 --> 00:03:32,026
I'm sure we did great.
If we didn't do great,

82
00:03:32,095 --> 00:03:33,473
we'll just take it again.

83
00:03:33,497 --> 00:03:34,540
I took my boards twice,
so it'll be fine, right?

84
00:03:34,564 --> 00:03:36,175
April, I'm sure we did fine.

85
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:37,811
I mean, we did fine, right?

86
00:03:37,835 --> 00:03:39,179
If I hadn't known
you two already,

87
00:03:39,203 --> 00:03:40,963
I would have
thought you cheated.

88
00:03:41,738 --> 00:03:45,007
90%. We crushed it!

89
00:03:45,092 --> 00:03:46,369
Ow! Mmm.

90
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:47,804
Yes! She likes to win.

91
00:03:47,828 --> 00:03:49,206
Yeah, no, that's
good. That's good.

92
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:50,870
Let me get your
exercises for this week.

93
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,233
So...

94
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:57,703
Listen, um...

95
00:03:57,771 --> 00:04:01,356
There is one problem that
we really haven't discussed.

96
00:04:01,442 --> 00:04:02,590
What?

97
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:04,137
Well, come on, I
mean, we're compatible

98
00:04:04,161 --> 00:04:06,611
but we're certainly not equal.

99
00:04:06,664 --> 00:04:08,130
Oh, that. Yeah.

100
00:04:08,198 --> 00:04:11,716
I wasn't sure if that
really bothered you.

101
00:04:11,785 --> 00:04:13,434
Of course it really bothers me.

102
00:04:13,504 --> 00:04:14,931
Well, then we
should just fix it.

103
00:04:14,955 --> 00:04:17,221
Now...

104
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:18,401
Before we're married?

105
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:20,520
Yeah. I mean, the
solution's simple.

106
00:04:20,544 --> 00:04:21,976
Yeah, we just have sex.

107
00:04:22,045 --> 00:04:24,285
Get a joint checking account.

108
00:04:29,636 --> 00:04:30,952
Sharky, rundown.

109
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:32,031
I've pre-rounded on
all of your post-ops

110
00:04:32,055 --> 00:04:33,332
and uploaded yesterday's notes.

111
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:35,090
Mrs. Ott, my
aortic ulcer patient?

112
00:04:35,158 --> 00:04:37,558
Uh, echo shows an
improving EF of 65%.

113
00:04:37,627 --> 00:04:39,527
Nathan Glazier, my HLHS baby?

114
00:04:39,596 --> 00:04:41,458
Uh... Sats fell to 67.

115
00:04:41,482 --> 00:04:43,381
Now in the PICU.

116
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,250
Mr. Wu, valve repair?

117
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:47,719
There is no Mr. Wu
with a valve repair.

118
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:49,154
Very good. Here you go.

119
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:50,471
What's this for?

120
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,852
Well, you stayed up all night
keeping my patients awake

121
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:54,153
while I got a good night's rest.

122
00:04:54,177 --> 00:04:56,344
So, coffee.

123
00:04:56,412 --> 00:04:58,480
Are you headed downstairs?

124
00:04:58,549 --> 00:05:00,265
Dr. Grey's presenting
the 3D printer.

125
00:05:00,334 --> 00:05:02,044
You know what? I'm
gonna look at it later.

126
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:04,202
I want to check on the
Glazier baby's numbers.

127
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,510
PICU, one hour.

128
00:05:08,676 --> 00:05:10,225
So is that my tumor?

129
00:05:10,294 --> 00:05:12,305
Yes, and this is your esophagus,

130
00:05:12,329 --> 00:05:13,907
which we will remove.

131
00:05:13,931 --> 00:05:15,492
And then we'll replace it

132
00:05:15,516 --> 00:05:17,782
with a section of your
colon from down here.

133
00:05:17,851 --> 00:05:20,835
And part of my ass
will now be my throat.

134
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:22,648
Your colon is actually
your large intestine,

135
00:05:22,672 --> 00:05:24,884
and again we're only
gonna take a piece of it.

136
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:26,875
Well, honey, now when
you give a restaurant

137
00:05:26,943 --> 00:05:28,383
a bad review,
people can truly say,

138
00:05:28,445 --> 00:05:29,961
"You're talking
out of your ass."

139
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:31,179
Ugh!

140
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:32,914
When I eat their food,

141
00:05:32,982 --> 00:05:34,511
I can truly say, "It
tastes like crap."

142
00:05:34,535 --> 00:05:36,729
The food will not
taste like crap.

143
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:38,481
Hey, I'm still mad
at you for Zane's.

144
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:41,105
I ate there for 10 years
until you ruined it for me.

145
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:42,519
Oh, please, they
over-salt everything.

146
00:05:42,543 --> 00:05:44,008
Uh-huh.

147
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:47,712
Well, barring complications,
you'll soon be back

148
00:05:47,781 --> 00:05:50,131
to bossing us all around
about where we eat.

149
00:05:53,586 --> 00:05:54,652
Get another enema.

150
00:05:54,722 --> 00:05:55,782
But he already had one.

151
00:05:55,806 --> 00:05:57,638
Which is why I said, "Another."

152
00:05:57,707 --> 00:06:00,675
Look, we're dealing with the
most contaminated part of the body.

153
00:06:00,744 --> 00:06:02,154
Mmm. Oh! Can I do it

154
00:06:02,178 --> 00:06:03,923
after Dr. Grey's presentation?

155
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:05,067
I don't care when you do it

156
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:06,881
as long as you deliver
Duncan to the OR

157
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,783
with a squeaky clean colon.

158
00:06:08,852 --> 00:06:11,503
So when an opening came
up for maternal/fetal surgeon,

159
00:06:11,572 --> 00:06:13,650
I thought of you first. So I
pitched you to the board.

160
00:06:13,674 --> 00:06:16,474
And they just want one of us to
sit down with you to interview you.

161
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:17,937
You'll be meeting
with Dr. Torres.

162
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:19,773
Her resume really
speaks for itself.

163
00:06:19,797 --> 00:06:21,274
This is more of a formality.

164
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:22,575
Well, and maybe an
opportunity to learn

165
00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:24,144
a little more about the
woman you're dating.

166
00:06:24,168 --> 00:06:25,650
Not necessary at all.

167
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:28,286
So, anything you can
tell me about Dr. Torres?

168
00:06:28,355 --> 00:06:30,271
Um, she's great. I
mean, she's my ex...

169
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,923
So she's not that great.

170
00:06:31,991 --> 00:06:33,603
<i>Look, I'm sure she's
probably not an ax murderer,</i>

171
00:06:33,627 --> 00:06:35,071
but if there's something
there, I will give you a heads-up.

172
00:06:35,095 --> 00:06:37,040
Please don't. ARIZONA:
Just be yourself.

173
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:39,042
Hey. Hi! Um, this is
Dr. Emma Marling.

174
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:41,044
Dr. Callie Torres.
Good to meet you.

175
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:42,068
Let's do this.

176
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:47,850
Dr. Avery, Mrs. Maddox is
here to get her drain removed,

177
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:49,185
and I'll do it after
the presentation.

178
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:51,187
I'll do it myself,
Murphy. Really?

179
00:06:51,211 --> 00:06:52,354
Because I know the case...

180
00:06:52,378 --> 00:06:53,456
Nah, I prefer to do it myself.

181
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,880
Thanks.

182
00:06:56,934 --> 00:06:58,299
What, did I miss it?

183
00:06:58,368 --> 00:06:59,912
You didn't miss it. Do you
think they made a heart?

184
00:06:59,936 --> 00:07:01,848
Steph won't say, but I think
a heart's too complicated.

185
00:07:01,872 --> 00:07:03,082
Hey.

186
00:07:03,106 --> 00:07:04,206
A bladder?

187
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:05,435
Come on. What'd you guys print?

188
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:06,669
I'm not saying.

189
00:07:06,693 --> 00:07:09,133
But your minds will
be freakin' blown.

190
00:07:10,914 --> 00:07:12,409
Hey, how'd the
drop-off at day care go?

191
00:07:12,433 --> 00:07:14,077
Tear-free. How's your new toy?

192
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:16,701
Well, you'll have to wait
and see like everybody else.

193
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:17,880
Good morning, everyone.

194
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:19,104
Morning.

195
00:07:23,243 --> 00:07:26,339
Grey-Sloan Memorial has always
valued innovation as a top priority.

196
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:29,681
And today, the leader
of this charge is Dr. Grey.

197
00:07:29,733 --> 00:07:32,333
We should all follow her
in pushing the boundaries,

198
00:07:32,402 --> 00:07:37,105
moving medicine forward, finding
new ways to innovate. Dr. Grey?

199
00:07:37,174 --> 00:07:40,291
3D printing will allow
us to customize treatment

200
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,527
for an individual's
specific needs.

201
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:44,974
Instead of ordering and
waiting for an implant...

202
00:07:44,998 --> 00:07:46,242
Do you see that?

203
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:47,515
The printer, yeah, it's cool.

204
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:49,378
No, no, the guy next to her

205
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:50,642
with the eye twitch.

206
00:07:50,687 --> 00:07:52,437
Eventually, even
using a patient's

207
00:07:52,506 --> 00:07:54,839
own cells to prevent rejection.

208
00:07:54,908 --> 00:07:56,686
Hmm. Welcome to the age

209
00:07:56,710 --> 00:08:00,679
of personalized medicine.

210
00:08:00,747 --> 00:08:02,697
A fork? MAN 1: Oh, no.

211
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:07,445
Well, at least it isn't a spork.

212
00:08:08,705 --> 00:08:11,483
You guys, we just got
the printer yesterday.

213
00:08:11,507 --> 00:08:13,219
We're testing it
out. Forks today...

214
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:16,477
Tomorrow, portal
veins for actual people.

215
00:08:17,347 --> 00:08:18,613
You guys!

216
00:08:31,612 --> 00:08:33,311
Oh, if your mother
could see you now.

217
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:35,124
She'd take issue with my hair.

218
00:08:35,148 --> 00:08:36,781
She'd be proud.

219
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,983
Did I ever tell you the
story about how I chose

220
00:08:39,052 --> 00:08:40,217
my first research project?

221
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:41,564
Many times. You
know, it's looking

222
00:08:41,588 --> 00:08:42,987
a little too comfy in here.

223
00:08:43,056 --> 00:08:44,756
Are you getting your laps in?

224
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:46,619
You can get one in now. You
can walk me to the elevator.

225
00:08:46,643 --> 00:08:47,720
I have a patient to see.

226
00:08:47,744 --> 00:08:49,264
Go change the face of medicine.

227
00:08:49,312 --> 00:08:51,106
You need to be doing your laps.

228
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:53,448
You need to be walking.

229
00:08:53,517 --> 00:08:55,650
Another captive runs screaming

230
00:08:55,718 --> 00:08:59,270
from your theater of boredom.

231
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:00,579
Move along, C.J.

232
00:09:00,641 --> 00:09:03,325
Oh, you know you
need some new material?

233
00:09:03,393 --> 00:09:05,794
I know your entire
repertoire by heart.

234
00:09:05,862 --> 00:09:07,144
They're good stories.

235
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:10,465
You see? Even Dr. Kepner's
heard them multiple times.

236
00:09:10,533 --> 00:09:12,867
You should come take a
walk with me. Come on.

237
00:09:12,935 --> 00:09:15,837
I'll tell you some
really good stories.

238
00:09:15,905 --> 00:09:18,440
You get a head
start. I'll catch up.

239
00:09:19,909 --> 00:09:22,493
And close your gown. I
can see your underwear.

240
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:23,739
I'm not wearing any.

241
00:09:28,334 --> 00:09:30,401
Uh, Harvey? Yes, can I help you?

242
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:31,648
No, but I think I can help you.

243
00:09:31,672 --> 00:09:33,065
I can fix that. It'll
take about 30 minutes.

244
00:09:33,089 --> 00:09:34,522
Fix what?

245
00:09:34,591 --> 00:09:36,291
Twitch.

246
00:09:36,359 --> 00:09:37,903
I don't know who
you are, but frankly,

247
00:09:37,927 --> 00:09:39,138
this is none of your business.

248
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:41,613
It's not a twitch, it's
a... Hemifacial spasm.

249
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:42,992
See, I can decompress the nerve.

250
00:09:43,016 --> 00:09:45,150
It's minimally invasive.
It's barely even a surgery.

251
00:09:45,218 --> 00:09:46,584
Who the hell are you?

252
00:09:46,653 --> 00:09:48,097
He's Derek Shepherd, one
of the best neurosurgeons

253
00:09:48,121 --> 00:09:50,266
in the country. I really
think you should let him fix it.

254
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:52,624
And who are you? Jackson
Avery, plastics, ENT.

255
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:54,403
I would really love to
observe, if that's cool with you.

256
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:56,322
No, that's not cool.
Now if you'll excuse me,

257
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:57,607
I haven't had a thing
to eat all morning.

258
00:09:57,631 --> 00:09:59,998
If you don't eat,
I can do it today.

259
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:01,916
Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

260
00:10:06,122 --> 00:10:08,907
Did you hear Mer just
revolutionized the world of cutlery?

261
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:12,259
No, I did not.

262
00:10:12,328 --> 00:10:15,129
Working on a liver
model. It's printing up now.

263
00:10:16,433 --> 00:10:17,465
That's great.

264
00:10:18,301 --> 00:10:19,517
It is great.

265
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,190
What the hell's the
matter with you...

266
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:32,396
Stay out of it.

267
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,015
Okay.

268
00:10:34,084 --> 00:10:36,195
Thanks for letting me pick up
a few shifts. I appreciate that.

269
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:38,539
Absolutely. It's good
to have you back.

270
00:10:40,424 --> 00:10:41,723
Uh, that's wrong.

271
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,502
My esophagectomy is
supposed to be in OR two.

272
00:10:43,526 --> 00:10:45,292
Sorry, trauma
came in this morning,

273
00:10:45,361 --> 00:10:46,927
and now you're in OR three.

274
00:10:47,848 --> 00:10:49,531
But I planned for OR two.

275
00:10:49,599 --> 00:10:51,527
It was set up exactly the way
I needed it for my procedure.

276
00:10:51,551 --> 00:10:53,718
OR three is identical to OR two.

277
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:55,386
Good to have you back, Ben.

278
00:10:58,525 --> 00:10:59,724
Um...

279
00:10:59,793 --> 00:11:01,225
What's wrong with OR three?

280
00:11:01,294 --> 00:11:02,574
Is there a smell in there, too?

281
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:06,703
There is a smell in Tuck's room,

282
00:11:06,733 --> 00:11:08,065
and I'm gonna find it.

283
00:11:21,064 --> 00:11:23,798
Mr. and Mrs. Glazier.

284
00:11:23,866 --> 00:11:25,346
Did you figure out why

285
00:11:25,402 --> 00:11:26,879
Nathan's not getting any better?

286
00:11:26,903 --> 00:11:28,481
The left side of
your son's heart

287
00:11:28,505 --> 00:11:30,871
can't effectively pump
blood to the rest of his body.

288
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,851
So, last week we
inserted something

289
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:34,853
to help divert the blood
flow to the right side.

290
00:11:34,877 --> 00:11:36,277
Right, you put in the conduit.

291
00:11:36,346 --> 00:11:37,606
Is it not working or something?

292
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:38,775
The conduit is synthetic.

293
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:42,333
So, in some cases, the
body refuses to accept it.

294
00:11:42,402 --> 00:11:45,147
We believe Nathan is in the
beginning stages of rejection.

295
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:47,650
We're running more
tests to be sure.

296
00:11:47,674 --> 00:11:49,907
And what happens
if he's rejecting it?

297
00:11:49,976 --> 00:11:52,055
Well, first we treat
it with medication.

298
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:53,319
But worst-case scenario,

299
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,974
we take it out and
put in a new one.

300
00:11:54,998 --> 00:11:56,263
With another synthetic one,

301
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:57,498
but won't he just

302
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:58,833
reject that one, too?

303
00:11:58,901 --> 00:12:00,963
Let's not get ahead
of ourselves just yet.

304
00:12:00,987 --> 00:12:03,387
We'll let you know as soon
as we have more information.

305
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:05,556
You said you have answers,

306
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:06,825
but you really don't, do you?

307
00:12:11,331 --> 00:12:13,231
Okay, so then, um,

308
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,233
after UW you went
to the Cleveland clinic.

309
00:12:15,302 --> 00:12:17,246
That's impressive. Mmm-hmm.

310
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:19,237
Under Lacy.

311
00:12:19,306 --> 00:12:21,917
And the focus there was
on congenital heart disorders.

312
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:24,025
Oh, but then you
left after only a year?

313
00:12:24,093 --> 00:12:26,339
Yeah, there were so many
great opportunities out here

314
00:12:26,363 --> 00:12:27,483
in Seattle.

315
00:12:28,732 --> 00:12:30,732
Really?

316
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,901
And there were some
personal elements at play, too.

317
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:40,658
I was going through a divorce.

318
00:12:40,726 --> 00:12:42,204
And we both
worked at the clinic,

319
00:12:42,228 --> 00:12:44,473
and that became untenable,
it was affecting my work,

320
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:45,608
so I made a move.

321
00:12:45,632 --> 00:12:47,364
Oh.

322
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:50,501
No, right, yeah, no, I get that.

323
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:52,148
So then you moved
to Seattle Pres?

324
00:12:52,172 --> 00:12:53,715
Yes. A year as an attending,

325
00:12:53,739 --> 00:12:56,118
and then running the
maternal/fetal department

326
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:57,319
for the last year.

327
00:12:57,343 --> 00:12:59,503
My research... Was
that hard for you?

328
00:12:59,646 --> 00:13:01,111
To give up your job?

329
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,698
Well, your city, to your ex?

330
00:13:05,835 --> 00:13:07,235
Uh...

331
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:10,166
I've been trying to wake him.

332
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:12,935
Come on, buddy.

333
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,770
We've let you sleep
in long enough.

334
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,010
Good morning, Will.

335
00:13:18,414 --> 00:13:20,949
My big day started
out as a nightmare

336
00:13:21,017 --> 00:13:23,084
when a clown came in at dawn,

337
00:13:23,152 --> 00:13:26,320
asking me if I wanted
a balloon animal.

338
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:28,739
Clowns are a ped's floor hazard.

339
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:31,770
Are you still going to try to
remove all of the tumors today?

340
00:13:31,794 --> 00:13:34,562
It just seems like it's
a lot to do all at once.

341
00:13:34,631 --> 00:13:37,164
Will's cancer is a very
aggressive sarcoma.

342
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:38,799
It's an all-or-nothing approach.

343
00:13:38,868 --> 00:13:40,779
We've come up with a
plan to remove all of them,

344
00:13:40,803 --> 00:13:42,220
starting with number one.

345
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:44,333
Some will be a snap, but
there are a few tricky ones,

346
00:13:44,357 --> 00:13:45,806
like tumor number eight.

347
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:48,156
It's deep in the liver, but
we'll do our best to get it.

348
00:13:49,111 --> 00:13:50,144
We'll get it.

349
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,379
We'll try.

350
00:13:52,449 --> 00:13:55,527
Um, it's sort of like
trying to get past level six.

351
00:13:55,551 --> 00:13:57,151
You know, there are
some, uh, fighters,

352
00:13:57,186 --> 00:13:58,786
but we need to
be really precise.

353
00:13:58,855 --> 00:14:02,657
We will eat all those dots
and kill all those ghosts.

354
00:14:02,726 --> 00:14:04,858
She doesn't play video games.

355
00:14:05,745 --> 00:14:07,111
We'll see you in the OR.

356
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:15,719
What are you doing here?

357
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:18,089
Oh, I switched with Knox.

358
00:14:18,158 --> 00:14:21,142
Uh, Ben Warren. I don't
know if we met before I left.

359
00:14:21,211 --> 00:14:23,989
Oh, oh. I was actually
at your wedding.

360
00:14:24,013 --> 00:14:25,857
I got you that pizza stone.

361
00:14:25,881 --> 00:14:27,482
We have a pizza stone?

362
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:30,296
Yeah, I got you a
circular clay stone

363
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,164
about 15 inches in diameter.

364
00:14:32,188 --> 00:14:34,622
It's kind of my standard gift.

365
00:14:34,691 --> 00:14:36,035
Yeah, I just always used

366
00:14:36,059 --> 00:14:38,259
your typical cookie sheet
and poked holes in the foil.

367
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:40,623
Oh, well, then this
will change your life.

368
00:14:40,647 --> 00:14:44,381
The crust that always sticks
to the edges never gets burned.

369
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:46,290
You really can
tell the difference?

370
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,872
You broke scrub.

371
00:14:51,941 --> 00:14:53,124
I'm sorry?

372
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:55,037
Your left hand dropped
below the sterile field.

373
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:56,427
Go re-scrub.

374
00:14:56,496 --> 00:14:58,256
I didn't move my hand... Yes.

375
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,864
It did. I saw it.

376
00:14:59,933 --> 00:15:01,382
You want to call me a liar,

377
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:02,900
you need to go re-scrub now.

378
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:12,176
Miranda, you need a minute?

379
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:14,779
I need a quiet OR
so we can begin.

380
00:15:18,335 --> 00:15:19,500
10 blade.

381
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:26,023
Right this way.

382
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:29,004
Well, your EMG did confirm
that it is a hemifacial spasm.

383
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:30,739
So, we'll just get you
started on some pre-op tests.

384
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,340
Wait, I know I signed the form,

385
00:15:32,364 --> 00:15:34,632
but how do I know
this is gonna work?

386
00:15:34,701 --> 00:15:37,446
I mean, I've already tried
Botox, muscle relaxers and...

387
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:39,971
Well, you know, you sell
more than just 3D printers.

388
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:41,951
Correct. I also
sell ink cartridges.

389
00:15:41,975 --> 00:15:43,586
No, no, what I mean is
that you sell inspiration.

390
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,571
You are the future
face of medicine.

391
00:15:45,595 --> 00:15:48,112
Don't you want that
face to be twitch-free?

392
00:15:48,181 --> 00:15:49,480
The surgery will work.

393
00:15:49,549 --> 00:15:51,316
See? You should listen to him.

394
00:15:51,384 --> 00:15:53,746
He's a guy in a bathrobe.
I'm Dr. Richard Webber.

395
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:55,431
I basically trained these two.

396
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:56,695
You're in good hands.

397
00:15:57,173 --> 00:15:58,250
Right this way.

398
00:15:58,274 --> 00:16:00,007
Dr. Avery...

399
00:16:00,076 --> 00:16:01,954
I know you said you
removed Mrs. Maddox's drain,

400
00:16:01,978 --> 00:16:03,405
but I'm worried about a seroma.

401
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:05,340
Should I go ahead and...
No, no, don't do anything.

402
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:07,724
I'll do it myself after surgery.

403
00:16:08,284 --> 00:16:09,779
Hey, Murphy!

404
00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:10,901
Get in here.

405
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,598
You didn't hear the
end of my story. Come.

406
00:16:12,622 --> 00:16:14,750
I go to his house,
we eat dinner,

407
00:16:14,774 --> 00:16:17,341
we talk, we watch TV, we talk,

408
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:21,145
we kiss, we... Other
stuff, and then we stop.

409
00:16:21,214 --> 00:16:23,914
I go home, and
it's hard, you know,

410
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,461
because it's not like I
don't know what I'm missing.

411
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:26,778
I know what I'm missing.

412
00:16:26,802 --> 00:16:27,879
What do I do?

413
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:28,980
Hmm? Well, okay, hold on.

414
00:16:29,004 --> 00:16:30,449
What exactly are you asking me?

415
00:16:30,473 --> 00:16:32,974
Well... How do I resist?

416
00:16:34,143 --> 00:16:35,663
Remember when
you had that flirtation

417
00:16:35,711 --> 00:16:37,456
with intern Murphy,
and then you decided not

418
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,879
to take it any further?

419
00:16:38,948 --> 00:16:41,399
Oh. Yeah. Um, I
took that further.

420
00:16:42,469 --> 00:16:44,251
You had sex? Yeah.

421
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,000
Was it... Awesome.

422
00:16:46,306 --> 00:16:48,472
This is not... You're not...

423
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:50,174
I have to go away from you now.

424
00:16:54,464 --> 00:16:56,742
Ready with tumor number one.

425
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:58,327
Okay, you see that?

426
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:00,935
Already going great. One down...

427
00:17:01,004 --> 00:17:03,415
Fourteen to go. I wish we
had gotten to him sooner.

428
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:05,701
He was diagnosed
already stage four.

429
00:17:05,725 --> 00:17:07,725
Typical teenager.

430
00:17:07,794 --> 00:17:09,905
He ignored his symptoms, didn't
want to ask for help from anyone,

431
00:17:09,929 --> 00:17:12,575
and now he's got an abdomen
completely covered with tumors.

432
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:14,377
Well, you're right. He
is a typical teenager,

433
00:17:14,401 --> 00:17:16,066
which means he can beat this.

434
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:19,403
He's strong, able to
fight. And what's better?

435
00:17:19,471 --> 00:17:21,066
What? He's in my OR.

436
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:22,556
In the OR of someone standing on

437
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:23,958
the forefront of medicine.

438
00:17:24,026 --> 00:17:25,270
You should print a spoon next.

439
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:27,614
That way we'll be able to
reach tumor number two.

440
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:33,217
It is an anatomically correct
liver model with a portal vein.

441
00:17:33,286 --> 00:17:35,686
It's a plastic
blob. I'm starving.

442
00:17:35,754 --> 00:17:37,266
Can they print
food or just utensils?

443
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:38,434
When will the model be done?

444
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:39,458
Ten, maybe 12 hours.

445
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:40,758
That long?

446
00:17:40,827 --> 00:17:42,371
It's life-saving
technology, Shane.

447
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:43,873
If you want it faster, page God.

448
00:17:43,897 --> 00:17:46,246
It's a fake organ. How
long for functional items?

449
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:47,559
Like an actual vascular graft?

450
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:48,777
Like a pretzel.

451
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:50,134
Here it is.

452
00:17:50,203 --> 00:17:51,568
"Biodegradable polymers."

453
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:52,953
What are you looking for?

454
00:17:53,022 --> 00:17:55,355
Nothing. It's just interesting.

455
00:17:55,424 --> 00:17:56,774
Printing's the future.

456
00:17:56,826 --> 00:17:59,360
What's a typical
Saturday like for you?

457
00:17:59,429 --> 00:18:00,862
Oh, well, listen,

458
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:02,842
I know that the newest
attendings pull the most calls.

459
00:18:02,866 --> 00:18:04,242
So I have no problem
working weekends.

460
00:18:04,266 --> 00:18:08,986
Oh, yeah, no. I'm just, I'm
wondering what you do for fun.

461
00:18:09,055 --> 00:18:10,454
What feeds your soul?

462
00:18:11,724 --> 00:18:13,491
I, uh, read.

463
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,492
I like to cook. I like movies.

464
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:20,448
I have a German
shepherd mix named Lila.

465
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:23,033
But no kids from your
previous marriage?

466
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:24,952
Well, previous marriage?

467
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:26,331
No, I'm just...

468
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:27,822
I'm just sayin',

469
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:30,135
is kids something you see
down the line in your future?

470
00:18:30,159 --> 00:18:33,010
Do you want kids?

471
00:18:33,078 --> 00:18:36,247
I'm sorry. I don't think
you can ask me this legally

472
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:37,315
in a job interview.

473
00:18:38,067 --> 00:18:39,400
Oh, of course not.

474
00:18:39,468 --> 00:18:42,697
Of course not. No. You
know what? Forget I asked.

475
00:18:42,721 --> 00:18:44,166
I haven't given
much thought to kids.

476
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:45,434
Please, never mind.

477
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,525
But if I do, or when I do,

478
00:18:47,594 --> 00:18:49,660
I imagine girls, two.

479
00:18:49,729 --> 00:18:52,113
I know that they'll
be hell in junior high,

480
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,252
but I grew up with sisters.

481
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,367
Aw. Nice.

482
00:18:56,436 --> 00:18:57,451
Yeah.

483
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:01,105
Just a few more questions.

484
00:19:01,907 --> 00:19:03,185
More?

485
00:19:03,209 --> 00:19:06,660
Hey, how's it all going?

486
00:19:06,729 --> 00:19:08,529
It's great.

487
00:19:09,132 --> 00:19:11,449
Yeah, we're making progress.

488
00:19:11,518 --> 00:19:13,358
Good. Yeah.

489
00:19:16,038 --> 00:19:17,958
In Japan, they're
making conduits

490
00:19:18,007 --> 00:19:19,551
and seeding them
with the patient's cells

491
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:22,142
before implanting them,
taking away the risk of rejection.

492
00:19:22,211 --> 00:19:23,477
Uh-huh. Yay, Japan.

493
00:19:23,546 --> 00:19:24,745
Why can't we do that?

494
00:19:24,814 --> 00:19:26,414
Why can't we use a
3D printer to create

495
00:19:26,482 --> 00:19:28,982
a conduit that Nathan's body
would recognize as his own?

496
00:19:29,051 --> 00:19:30,462
He wouldn't need
surgery after surgery

497
00:19:30,486 --> 00:19:32,047
to keep replacing the
failed synthetic one.

498
00:19:32,071 --> 00:19:34,138
It's brilliant, but the
research alone...

499
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:36,985
I thought you would say that.
Here are the Japanese studies.

500
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,621
We would need extensive imaging

501
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:41,106
to see if Nathan's
even a candidate.

502
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:42,307
Also covered.

503
00:19:42,331 --> 00:19:44,531
I've scheduled a
cardiac CT and MRI.

504
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,950
It's too experimental.

505
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,700
We'd have to file a
compassionate release

506
00:19:48,754 --> 00:19:50,321
with the FDA, get approval.

507
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:52,806
These things take time
that Nathan may not have.

508
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:55,509
If I start the groundwork
with the FDA,

509
00:19:55,578 --> 00:19:56,818
will you consider it?

510
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:03,116
Sure.

511
00:20:07,723 --> 00:20:08,800
Can we talk?

512
00:20:08,824 --> 00:20:10,624
Hi. Yes, can we?

513
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:19,583
I want our wedding
night to be amazing.

514
00:20:19,652 --> 00:20:21,513
So do I. And I want
our first time to be...

515
00:20:21,537 --> 00:20:22,669
And that's the thing.

516
00:20:22,738 --> 00:20:25,139
It will be the first time.

517
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:26,257
For me.

518
00:20:28,361 --> 00:20:30,244
I just, I want it to be right.

519
00:20:31,547 --> 00:20:34,359
Before we have sex, I want
us to commit to one another

520
00:20:34,383 --> 00:20:35,460
in the presence of God and...

521
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:36,516
Shh.

522
00:20:37,219 --> 00:20:38,299
April...

523
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:41,521
I love you.

524
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:42,756
Yeah.

525
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:45,959
And I am going to love
you the rest of my life.

526
00:20:46,028 --> 00:20:48,962
And I think that God knows that.

527
00:20:49,031 --> 00:20:51,351
I think he knows how we feel.

528
00:20:52,534 --> 00:20:54,301
Or she.

529
00:20:55,805 --> 00:20:57,171
Or she.

530
00:20:58,507 --> 00:20:59,707
Well...

531
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:05,412
Reverend Drew did say
that we should support

532
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,613
one another.

533
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:10,317
So, if this is really
important to you.

534
00:21:10,385 --> 00:21:11,513
It is really, really
important to me.

535
00:21:11,537 --> 00:21:12,603
Really?

536
00:21:16,658 --> 00:21:17,858
Okay.

537
00:21:19,928 --> 00:21:21,778
Okay? Mmm-hmm.

538
00:21:23,316 --> 00:21:26,500
Hey, those adhesions
are stuck to the intestines.

539
00:21:26,569 --> 00:21:29,620
So, make sure you're on
the right plane of dissection.

540
00:21:29,688 --> 00:21:31,382
Think I'm finally
getting through...

541
00:21:31,406 --> 00:21:32,689
Dah! Careful!

542
00:21:32,758 --> 00:21:35,209
Wilson, if you cut the bowel
instead of the adhesion,

543
00:21:35,278 --> 00:21:36,310
there'll be spillage

544
00:21:36,379 --> 00:21:38,128
all over the man's
abdominal cavity.

545
00:21:38,197 --> 00:21:39,446
Right.

546
00:21:39,515 --> 00:21:41,035
You know, just let me do it.

547
00:21:46,572 --> 00:21:47,666
Dr. Bailey!

548
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:49,134
I need to feel
the tissue myself.

549
00:21:49,158 --> 00:21:50,491
Dr. Bailey!

550
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:51,870
What? Spillage.

551
00:21:53,246 --> 00:21:54,978
Irrigation.

552
00:21:56,683 --> 00:21:58,015
Dr. Bailey.

553
00:21:58,083 --> 00:21:59,323
Dr. Bailey.

554
00:21:59,969 --> 00:22:01,102
Miranda.

555
00:22:01,187 --> 00:22:02,502
More irrigation.

556
00:22:03,939 --> 00:22:05,139
Dr. Bailey!

557
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:06,339
Miranda.

558
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:08,341
Irrigation, now.

559
00:22:14,216 --> 00:22:15,894
We need to completely
wash out the abdomen.

560
00:22:15,918 --> 00:22:17,551
Did you completely wash it out?

561
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:20,165
I have, several times. I don't
see any stool or contamination.

562
00:22:20,189 --> 00:22:21,989
And we need to
get it closed ASAP.

563
00:22:22,058 --> 00:22:24,841
The hole can cause sepsis,
which could drop blood pressure.

564
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:27,030
Vitals are steady, we're fine.

565
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:31,109
We still have all
the anastomoses.

566
00:22:31,133 --> 00:22:33,562
Just concentrate on
one thing at a time.

567
00:22:33,586 --> 00:22:36,431
We fix the hole. Then we
move on to the next step.

568
00:22:36,455 --> 00:22:39,824
Routine complication.
It happens.

569
00:22:39,892 --> 00:22:43,894
Everything's under
control. We're good.

570
00:22:43,962 --> 00:22:45,729
You good, Miranda?

571
00:22:51,687 --> 00:22:53,353
3-0 Vicryl.

572
00:22:58,411 --> 00:22:59,643
Hi.

573
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:00,727
Hey.

574
00:23:03,132 --> 00:23:05,699
Are all the materials
biocompatible?

575
00:23:05,767 --> 00:23:07,117
Depends on the cartridge.

576
00:23:07,186 --> 00:23:09,086
What happens if you, like...

577
00:23:09,154 --> 00:23:10,788
You know, pause it?

578
00:23:10,856 --> 00:23:13,174
Start something else?

579
00:23:13,242 --> 00:23:16,110
You'd be stuck
with a hunk of junk.

580
00:23:16,179 --> 00:23:17,890
And then Dr. Grey
would have to start over,

581
00:23:17,914 --> 00:23:20,876
sending her back a
whole day in her research,

582
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,178
resulting in her
desire to murder me.

583
00:23:23,202 --> 00:23:24,401
Hmm.

584
00:23:28,307 --> 00:23:29,773
Great.

585
00:23:33,462 --> 00:23:36,297
Vertebral artery is tortuous.

586
00:23:36,365 --> 00:23:38,443
See, it's compressing
the facial nerve

587
00:23:38,467 --> 00:23:39,911
which is the
source of the twitch.

588
00:23:39,935 --> 00:23:40,967
Yeah.

589
00:23:41,036 --> 00:23:42,814
You wanna do the decompression?

590
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:44,271
Hell, yeah.

591
00:23:46,809 --> 00:23:49,154
Dr. Avery, trauma's
asking if we can take a look

592
00:23:49,178 --> 00:23:51,423
at a huge facial lac in the ICU.

593
00:23:51,447 --> 00:23:52,813
Should I do the sutures?

594
00:23:52,881 --> 00:23:53,964
No, definitely not.

595
00:23:54,033 --> 00:23:56,133
I can handle it. Seriously.

596
00:23:56,201 --> 00:23:57,681
Seriously, I'll be
there in an hour.

597
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,236
Thank you.

598
00:24:03,592 --> 00:24:05,470
Murphy's not bad, you know.

599
00:24:05,494 --> 00:24:06,827
Oh, I know.

600
00:24:06,896 --> 00:24:07,976
It's just that I'm better.

601
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:09,550
Can I have a pledget, please?

602
00:24:10,599 --> 00:24:12,283
Thank you.

603
00:24:12,351 --> 00:24:14,391
Put it to the left, dumbass.

604
00:24:15,655 --> 00:24:16,765
What? Are you a half-wit?

605
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:19,723
I said place it
to the left, idiot.

606
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:21,336
Those are things
Mark Sloan used to say

607
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,721
when he thought he
was better than you.

608
00:24:22,745 --> 00:24:24,255
Are we taking a walk
down memory lane now?

609
00:24:24,279 --> 00:24:26,324
You know, I convinced
him to start teaching you.

610
00:24:26,348 --> 00:24:27,643
You're a full-wit.
Now you have to start

611
00:24:27,667 --> 00:24:29,200
teaching the residents,

612
00:24:29,268 --> 00:24:30,667
hand them the keys.

613
00:24:30,736 --> 00:24:32,903
And let them take it on
a joyride? I don't think so.

614
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:35,684
Well, pretty soon they're gonna
be 18 and have their own cars.

615
00:24:35,708 --> 00:24:38,108
Let's teach 'em
before they get there.

616
00:24:38,177 --> 00:24:39,921
All right, securing the
pad with fibrin glue.

617
00:24:39,945 --> 00:24:41,256
You're gonna need
a lot of that, asshat.

618
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,681
All right, I get it. Point made.

619
00:24:43,749 --> 00:24:45,516
I know. It's just so fun.

620
00:24:47,803 --> 00:24:49,881
There she is. Number eight.

621
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:53,407
Right smack in the
middle of the liver.

622
00:24:53,475 --> 00:24:55,186
Let's skip it. Skip it?

623
00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:57,122
Why would we do that?
We'll come back to it.

624
00:24:57,146 --> 00:24:58,874
No, we planned this
surgery in an order.

625
00:24:58,898 --> 00:25:00,008
We should stick to it.

626
00:25:00,032 --> 00:25:01,765
Alex, if we remove
the other ones first,

627
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:04,201
we'll have better exposure.
Let's just come back to it.

628
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:05,509
It's the hardest one.

629
00:25:05,538 --> 00:25:07,048
If it turns out we
can't remove it,

630
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:08,483
what's the point of even
going for the easy ones?

631
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:09,551
Look, we should try...

632
00:25:09,575 --> 00:25:10,652
I hear what you're saying,

633
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:12,509
but I'm the lead
surgeon on this,

634
00:25:12,578 --> 00:25:14,178
and I'm making the call.

635
00:25:14,246 --> 00:25:15,946
Let's go to number nine.

636
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:19,315
Dr. Yang! PICU just paged.

637
00:25:19,384 --> 00:25:21,429
Nathan's definitely
in full-blown rejection.

638
00:25:21,453 --> 00:25:23,197
I did it. Did what?

639
00:25:23,221 --> 00:25:25,133
I spoke to the FDA, filled out the
release, I just need you to sign it

640
00:25:25,157 --> 00:25:26,300
before they can
start reviewing it.

641
00:25:26,324 --> 00:25:27,357
Ross.

642
00:25:27,426 --> 00:25:29,626
We're not gonna
do it. Call them back.

643
00:25:29,695 --> 00:25:31,272
You said you'd consider it
if I covered the obstacles.

644
00:25:31,296 --> 00:25:33,530
There are other
options. Safer options.

645
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:35,665
We can increase his IV steroids,

646
00:25:35,735 --> 00:25:36,735
start prograf...

647
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:38,168
No!

648
00:25:38,236 --> 00:25:40,704
None of those are as
good as a biological conduit.

649
00:25:40,773 --> 00:25:43,056
I have all the information.
We have the printer.

650
00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:45,058
Ross.

651
00:25:45,127 --> 00:25:46,610
It's not our printer.

652
00:25:46,678 --> 00:25:49,479
It's Dr. Grey's printer and
she is using it to print now.

653
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:51,414
So we can't do it.

654
00:25:51,851 --> 00:25:53,700
I'm sorry.

655
00:25:59,075 --> 00:26:01,303
Then, I pan-sear
them for a few minutes

656
00:26:01,327 --> 00:26:03,927
on both sides
until they're brown.

657
00:26:03,996 --> 00:26:05,161
And?

658
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:08,948
And that's how I make
my famous meatballs.

659
00:26:10,186 --> 00:26:11,896
That's not a story,
that's a recipe.

660
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:14,805
At least it got you to shut
your yap for a hot minute.

661
00:26:16,775 --> 00:26:18,242
Eh, it's useful.

662
00:26:18,311 --> 00:26:20,945
Uh, you know, uh, besides,

663
00:26:21,013 --> 00:26:22,757
it's better than you
speaking about...

664
00:26:25,801 --> 00:26:26,967
C.J.?

665
00:26:32,308 --> 00:26:33,740
C.J.?

666
00:26:39,231 --> 00:26:40,597
Okay.

667
00:26:42,201 --> 00:26:43,934
C.J.?

668
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:46,604
C.J...

669
00:26:46,672 --> 00:26:47,921
C.J.!

670
00:26:50,192 --> 00:26:52,025
C.J. I need some help!

671
00:26:52,094 --> 00:26:53,438
C.J.! Dr. Webber?

672
00:26:53,462 --> 00:26:54,989
Let me take over...
Okay, okay, I got this.

673
00:26:55,013 --> 00:26:56,363
Kepner, get a crash cart.

674
00:26:56,431 --> 00:26:59,233
Okay, get me one of epi
and 300 of amiodarone, now!

675
00:26:59,301 --> 00:27:00,633
On it.

676
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:02,580
<i>Code blue, third floor.</i>

677
00:27:02,604 --> 00:27:04,287
Come on, C.J.

678
00:27:09,945 --> 00:27:11,228
Callie loved you.

679
00:27:11,297 --> 00:27:14,314
She's very nice. Very
thorough, but very nice.

680
00:27:14,383 --> 00:27:15,949
How long have you
two been divorced?

681
00:27:16,017 --> 00:27:19,703
Um, well, I don't
think that we are.

682
00:27:19,771 --> 00:27:21,888
We're sort of
separated, I guess.

683
00:27:21,957 --> 00:27:23,957
Ah, you still have the ring.

684
00:27:24,026 --> 00:27:26,204
But you're seeing
other people, obviously.

685
00:27:26,228 --> 00:27:29,746
Um, yeah, we are.

686
00:27:29,815 --> 00:27:31,882
I'm so sorry. That
was way too personal.

687
00:27:31,951 --> 00:27:34,696
I just got out of a job
interview that was more intimate

688
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,319
than most rectal exams.

689
00:27:36,388 --> 00:27:37,899
I'm just not used to it.

690
00:27:37,923 --> 00:27:41,007
Uh, we don't do things
like this at Seattle Pres.

691
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:42,342
Well, then, come work here.

692
00:27:42,411 --> 00:27:44,545
Because we do way too
personal on a daily basis.

693
00:27:45,848 --> 00:27:47,731
We'll isolate the
vessels, then take

694
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,733
the tumor out
under direct vision.

695
00:27:49,801 --> 00:27:51,729
I can do it. ALEX: I don't
know if you can, Mer.

696
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:53,131
It might be better
just to close him.

697
00:27:53,155 --> 00:27:55,333
Well, if we don't resect it,
the cancer will only spread,

698
00:27:55,357 --> 00:27:57,574
and it'll eliminate his
chances of beating this thing.

699
00:27:57,642 --> 00:27:59,454
How do you get it without
taking the entire liver?

700
00:27:59,478 --> 00:28:01,923
Dr. Grey, I just wanted to show
you the latest on the liver model.

701
00:28:01,947 --> 00:28:03,446
Not now.

702
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:05,965
Edwards, scrub in. We're
gonna need your help retracting.

703
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:08,818
Alex, he's 15.

704
00:28:08,887 --> 00:28:11,971
I think we need to be as
aggressive as we can. Clamp.

705
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:19,057
That's the last of the
reconstruction, right?

706
00:28:19,081 --> 00:28:21,748
That's right. Ben, can we
get a methylene blue test?

707
00:28:21,817 --> 00:28:23,745
Coming right up. MIRANDA:
Wilson, watch closely.

708
00:28:23,769 --> 00:28:24,769
If there's blue...

709
00:28:24,837 --> 00:28:26,037
There's a leak, on it.

710
00:28:28,457 --> 00:28:29,639
No blue.

711
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:31,141
Nice work, you guys.

712
00:28:32,945 --> 00:28:34,210
Let's also get a bubble test.

713
00:28:36,565 --> 00:28:37,831
Do we need both?

714
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:40,950
We need to be absolutely
sure that there's no leak.

715
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:44,488
If there's a breakdown
somewhere in the anastomosis,

716
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:48,558
then bacteria can seep
through, going God knows where,

717
00:28:48,627 --> 00:28:50,810
causing a potential
fatal infection.

718
00:28:50,879 --> 00:28:52,963
Is that what you want
for the patient, Wilson?

719
00:28:53,615 --> 00:28:55,782
No, ma'am.

720
00:28:55,851 --> 00:28:57,562
You know, bubble test
only takes a second.

721
00:28:57,586 --> 00:29:01,488
So, Wilson, as I inject
air into the NG tube,

722
00:29:01,557 --> 00:29:03,267
submerge his chest with saline.

723
00:29:03,291 --> 00:29:04,457
Okay.

724
00:29:09,481 --> 00:29:11,398
No bubble. Should
we start to close?

725
00:29:21,643 --> 00:29:23,255
We're not closing.
There's a leak.

726
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:26,480
There's a leak. I see a small
bubble, so there's a leak.

727
00:29:26,549 --> 00:29:27,759
We'll patch it. JO: A bubble?

728
00:29:27,783 --> 00:29:28,859
I don't see anything.

729
00:29:28,883 --> 00:29:29,917
It's there.

730
00:29:30,819 --> 00:29:31,935
Dr. Warren?

731
00:29:34,289 --> 00:29:35,421
Um...

732
00:29:36,325 --> 00:29:37,891
You know,

733
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,720
I didn't have a very good
angle from over here,

734
00:29:39,744 --> 00:29:42,930
but I trust Dr. Bailey
if she saw a bubble.

735
00:29:42,998 --> 00:29:45,279
Might as well put a
patch on to be safe.

736
00:29:46,252 --> 00:29:48,835
We'll oversew it and
cover it with a muscle flap.

737
00:29:48,904 --> 00:29:50,654
Suction. Scissors.

738
00:29:55,394 --> 00:29:57,394
Uh, Harvey, are you okay?

739
00:29:57,463 --> 00:29:59,307
I'm waiting for it to twitch.

740
00:29:59,331 --> 00:30:00,697
It's twitched for 20 years.

741
00:30:00,765 --> 00:30:02,725
You can wait all you
want, but it's gone.

742
00:30:03,619 --> 00:30:05,068
We got it.

743
00:30:05,137 --> 00:30:06,836
Thank you.

744
00:30:06,905 --> 00:30:08,416
Who do you wanna see first?
The facial lac or Mrs. Maddox?

745
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,600
I'll take 'em both.

746
00:30:12,778 --> 00:30:15,429
Okay, I will take Mrs. Maddox,

747
00:30:15,497 --> 00:30:17,937
and you can take the facial lac.

748
00:30:19,918 --> 00:30:21,885
You know what? Why
don't you take 'em both?

749
00:30:21,937 --> 00:30:24,587
Dr. Avery, I will
not disappoint you.

750
00:30:32,281 --> 00:30:33,614
How you holding up?

751
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:36,382
I'm exhausted.

752
00:30:36,452 --> 00:30:38,162
You should've let me do the CPR.

753
00:30:38,186 --> 00:30:42,022
No, no, it's a good exhausted.

754
00:30:44,076 --> 00:30:46,442
I've been stuck in this bed,

755
00:30:46,495 --> 00:30:48,462
reminiscing about my old life,

756
00:30:51,433 --> 00:30:55,268
trying to feel
like myself again.

757
00:30:57,873 --> 00:31:00,006
And now I wanna be myself again.

758
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:03,777
Ready to get back to my feet and

759
00:31:05,848 --> 00:31:07,914
be the doctor I used to be.

760
00:31:12,104 --> 00:31:15,339
I lost myself there
for a while, Kepner.

761
00:31:17,743 --> 00:31:19,809
Now I'm ready to
get myself back.

762
00:31:29,121 --> 00:31:30,665
He's in florid heart failure.

763
00:31:30,689 --> 00:31:34,091
His EF is falling precipitously.

764
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:36,559
It's the hospital's printer.

765
00:31:36,628 --> 00:31:38,962
You taught me to take
what I need for my patient.

766
00:31:39,031 --> 00:31:42,332
We can't. Not this time.

767
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:45,602
I looked at Dr. Grey's research.
She still has months to go

768
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:47,548
before printing a portal
vein that will actually go

769
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:49,506
into a human patient.

770
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:52,709
But this? Building a
scaffold seeded with cells,

771
00:31:52,778 --> 00:31:54,544
we can do this.

772
00:31:54,613 --> 00:31:56,106
This baby can be saved today.

773
00:31:56,130 --> 00:31:58,081
I know, Shane. You
think I don't know this?

774
00:32:00,185 --> 00:32:01,829
Now set up for a
pericardiocentesis

775
00:32:01,853 --> 00:32:04,437
and do a repeat echo in an hour.

776
00:32:04,506 --> 00:32:06,267
<i>Mer, you have to stop now.</i>

777
00:32:06,291 --> 00:32:08,357
I'm about to do the
trisegmentectomy...

778
00:32:08,427 --> 00:32:09,470
Any further, you're
gonna move into

779
00:32:09,494 --> 00:32:10,655
segment two and three.

780
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:12,579
And it will be fine!

781
00:32:12,648 --> 00:32:14,159
There won't be enough
functioning liver to support this kid.

782
00:32:14,183 --> 00:32:15,993
I think it will, and I will
stop before I'm too deep.

783
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:17,529
You print one damn
fork, and now you think

784
00:32:17,553 --> 00:32:18,852
you're Moses or something.

785
00:32:18,921 --> 00:32:21,437
Alex, I am in the middle
of dividing this kid's liver.

786
00:32:21,506 --> 00:32:23,156
And I need this
conversation to be over!

787
00:32:23,225 --> 00:32:24,753
Oh, you gonna pull
rank on me again?

788
00:32:24,777 --> 00:32:25,887
Is that how the decision's made?

789
00:32:25,911 --> 00:32:27,455
You could
two-challenge rule. What?

790
00:32:27,479 --> 00:32:29,140
Dr. Webber told us about
the two-challenge rule

791
00:32:29,164 --> 00:32:31,531
where two surgeons who
agree can force a third surgeon

792
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,010
to stand down from
a course of action.

793
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:36,269
Okay, fine. So, Dr. Edwards,
you and I challenge

794
00:32:36,337 --> 00:32:39,272
Dr. Karev to relax
and let me finish.

795
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:41,118
No, I'm challenging you, Mer.

796
00:32:41,142 --> 00:32:43,087
I'm asking you to
stop what you're doing.

797
00:32:43,111 --> 00:32:44,143
Edwards?

798
00:32:46,181 --> 00:32:48,915
Dr. Grey, I think
you're amazing.

799
00:32:48,984 --> 00:32:50,494
And you made a beautiful fork,

800
00:32:50,518 --> 00:32:53,152
and I am so grateful to
have been a part of that.

801
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:55,083
But, right now, I do
think you're pushing it.

802
00:32:55,107 --> 00:32:58,090
And I have to second
Dr. Karev's challenge.

803
00:33:00,278 --> 00:33:01,778
Dr. Karev, you can close.

804
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:16,860
So, Robbins says
everybody loves you.

805
00:33:16,928 --> 00:33:18,005
I can't work here.

806
00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:19,496
What?

807
00:33:19,565 --> 00:33:21,876
These people are great.
They're incredibly nice,

808
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:27,420
and overly kind and
a little nosy, but great.

809
00:33:27,489 --> 00:33:31,157
But they're your people,
and they love you.

810
00:33:31,226 --> 00:33:33,042
And they care about you.

811
00:33:33,111 --> 00:33:35,122
And they'll close
ranks around you.

812
00:33:35,146 --> 00:33:37,781
They'll...

813
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:41,951
Uh, look, I worked
with my husband,

814
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:45,588
and when our
marriage fell apart...

815
00:33:45,657 --> 00:33:47,323
If something happens to us,

816
00:33:47,392 --> 00:33:50,493
if we broke up, they
would all choose you.

817
00:33:50,562 --> 00:33:52,195
And they'd want my

818
00:33:52,897 --> 00:33:54,297
blood.

819
00:33:56,134 --> 00:33:58,601
I would just be the bitch
that broke your heart.

820
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:01,538
Are you...

821
00:34:01,606 --> 00:34:04,290
Are you planning
to break my heart?

822
00:34:05,577 --> 00:34:07,777
No, but...

823
00:34:07,846 --> 00:34:09,930
So don't do it.

824
00:34:09,998 --> 00:34:11,164
Take the job.

825
00:34:12,617 --> 00:34:14,150
Owen, I can't.

826
00:34:15,721 --> 00:34:17,053
I can't risk it.

827
00:34:20,208 --> 00:34:22,592
Hey, you don't do it either.

828
00:34:24,095 --> 00:34:25,328
Do what?

829
00:34:26,164 --> 00:34:27,324
Break my heart.

830
00:34:36,824 --> 00:34:40,059
So, what does that
mean? Another surgery?

831
00:34:41,129 --> 00:34:44,180
More chemo and radiation?

832
00:34:44,249 --> 00:34:46,649
It means more time
on the peds floor.

833
00:34:46,718 --> 00:34:48,934
Yeah, it sucks. Um...

834
00:34:50,138 --> 00:34:53,472
But, you know,
while you're here,

835
00:34:53,542 --> 00:34:56,609
we'll get some things from home.

836
00:34:56,678 --> 00:34:58,656
You know, extend visiting hours

837
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,758
so, uh, your friends
can hang out.

838
00:35:00,782 --> 00:35:03,766
And, uh, I'll make sure

839
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:08,771
that no one rounds
on you before 11:00.

840
00:35:09,408 --> 00:35:11,040
No more peds stuff.

841
00:35:11,977 --> 00:35:13,057
Deal?

842
00:35:14,128 --> 00:35:15,294
Deal.

843
00:35:19,701 --> 00:35:21,078
Sorry about what
happened in the OR,

844
00:35:21,102 --> 00:35:22,382
but we made the right decision.

845
00:35:22,421 --> 00:35:23,753
I could've gotten that tumor.

846
00:35:23,822 --> 00:35:25,333
Nobody could've gotten
that tumor. I could have.

847
00:35:25,357 --> 00:35:26,597
Mer, I need to talk to you.

848
00:35:26,641 --> 00:35:28,019
I need a minute. It's
about a patient of mine.

849
00:35:28,043 --> 00:35:29,453
Well, I'm talking about a
patient of mine right now,

850
00:35:29,477 --> 00:35:31,155
so I need a minute.
I need the printer.

851
00:35:31,179 --> 00:35:32,823
It's my printer,
Cristina. No, it's not.

852
00:35:32,847 --> 00:35:34,447
It's the hospital's
printer, and...

853
00:35:34,516 --> 00:35:37,967
Which I got for them for
my research, for my grant.

854
00:35:38,036 --> 00:35:40,837
Which is important
research, but at this point,

855
00:35:40,905 --> 00:35:42,038
it's research, Meredith.

856
00:35:42,106 --> 00:35:43,651
And what I'm talking
about could save a life.

857
00:35:43,675 --> 00:35:44,852
I can't stop it in the middle.

858
00:35:44,876 --> 00:35:46,854
It will completely
destroy the model.

859
00:35:46,878 --> 00:35:48,222
Just because I printed a fork

860
00:35:48,246 --> 00:35:50,366
does not mean my
research is a joke.

861
00:35:50,699 --> 00:35:53,149
No one said it was a joke.

862
00:35:53,218 --> 00:35:54,717
But see, I could
print a scaffolding

863
00:35:54,786 --> 00:35:56,186
and make a biological conduit

864
00:35:56,254 --> 00:35:57,437
for a baby's heart.

865
00:35:57,505 --> 00:35:58,583
They're not even doing that yet.

866
00:35:58,607 --> 00:35:59,905
They are in Japan.

867
00:35:59,974 --> 00:36:01,608
So, if I get
compassionate release...

868
00:36:01,676 --> 00:36:03,042
I don't have time to argue.

869
00:36:03,111 --> 00:36:04,589
Submit a proposal to the board

870
00:36:04,613 --> 00:36:05,739
if you wanna use the printer.

871
00:36:05,763 --> 00:36:06,907
It's time-sensitive, Meredith.

872
00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:09,051
Well, then you
better get to work.

873
00:36:14,539 --> 00:36:16,373
So that's what it
was about in there?

874
00:36:16,441 --> 00:36:17,940
You and Yang?

875
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:19,342
She calls you a lousy doctor,

876
00:36:19,411 --> 00:36:20,788
and suddenly you have
something to prove?

877
00:36:20,812 --> 00:36:21,922
That is not what this is about.

878
00:36:21,946 --> 00:36:23,706
Oh, so you take it
out on my patient.

879
00:36:23,731 --> 00:36:25,075
I did not take it
out on your patient.

880
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:26,015
Look, you need to
be told you're good?

881
00:36:26,084 --> 00:36:27,417
Fine, Mer, you're good.

882
00:36:27,485 --> 00:36:29,919
But Yang was right. You
were a lousy doctor today.

883
00:36:38,697 --> 00:36:39,929
Torres!

884
00:36:39,998 --> 00:36:41,231
Hmm?

885
00:36:41,299 --> 00:36:42,598
Come walk with me.

886
00:36:45,003 --> 00:36:46,469
Looking good, sir.

887
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:47,871
Feeling good.

888
00:36:47,939 --> 00:36:51,307
You hear I saved the patient
in the room next door to me?

889
00:36:51,376 --> 00:36:53,809
I heard there was a
code. That was you?

890
00:36:53,879 --> 00:36:56,246
Let me tell you all about it.

891
00:36:56,314 --> 00:36:57,947
I was talking to a patient...

892
00:37:07,792 --> 00:37:09,308
Hi.

893
00:37:09,377 --> 00:37:10,677
Hi.

894
00:37:10,745 --> 00:37:12,411
Uh, come in.

895
00:37:21,607 --> 00:37:23,106
I love you, Matthew.

896
00:37:24,809 --> 00:37:26,142
I love you, too.

897
00:37:27,729 --> 00:37:30,362
I lost myself last year.

898
00:37:30,431 --> 00:37:33,066
And I worked really hard
to get back to who I was.

899
00:37:34,769 --> 00:37:37,136
The fact that I
stumbled in my faith...

900
00:37:37,205 --> 00:37:40,239
It matters to me.

901
00:37:40,308 --> 00:37:44,544
But it just, it feels so good
to be back to who I was

902
00:37:44,613 --> 00:37:46,613
and to have found someone
who shares that faith.

903
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:50,883
And, Matthew, I love you,
and I respect you too much

904
00:37:50,952 --> 00:37:52,318
for you to let that go.

905
00:37:55,489 --> 00:37:57,156
And...

906
00:37:57,225 --> 00:37:59,070
It's still gonna be
a first time for me,

907
00:37:59,094 --> 00:38:01,527
because it's gonna be
my first time with you.

908
00:38:04,483 --> 00:38:06,216
Oh, it's gonna be amazing.

909
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:14,323
If we have sex tonight,

910
00:38:14,392 --> 00:38:15,670
the only thing that will change

911
00:38:15,694 --> 00:38:16,904
is that you will have
broken a promise,

912
00:38:16,928 --> 00:38:19,128
and I know how that feels.

913
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:23,733
So...

914
00:38:25,336 --> 00:38:26,686
We're waiting.

915
00:38:28,523 --> 00:38:29,956
We're waiting.

916
00:38:32,026 --> 00:38:35,761
You know, we can lean
on each other for support.

917
00:38:37,065 --> 00:38:38,698
Hmm. Mmm-hmm.

918
00:38:49,311 --> 00:38:50,343
Okay.

919
00:38:50,412 --> 00:38:52,045
Okay.

920
00:38:52,113 --> 00:38:54,833
All right, but, uh, maybe we
shouldn't actually lean on each other.

921
00:38:55,467 --> 00:38:56,633
Ah.

922
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:10,096
You coming in here?

923
00:39:10,865 --> 00:39:12,899
Yeah, in, uh, one minute.

924
00:39:17,505 --> 00:39:19,571
<i>So, how do you beat the odds</i>

925
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:21,520
<i>when it's one against a billion?</i>

926
00:39:54,075 --> 00:39:55,875
I changed our plan on you.

927
00:39:55,944 --> 00:39:59,211
And it'll take time to
figure out our new plan.

928
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,814
But, Miranda, I'm glad I'm home,

929
00:40:01,883 --> 00:40:04,917
because something's
clearly going on.

930
00:40:04,986 --> 00:40:06,931
Between the checking and
re-checking the drawers,

931
00:40:06,955 --> 00:40:09,355
and pulling at your fingertips?

932
00:40:11,693 --> 00:40:13,459
You need help.

933
00:40:13,528 --> 00:40:15,138
What happened
today in that OR...

934
00:40:15,162 --> 00:40:18,498
You and I both know
that there was no bubble.

935
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:21,417
Uh...

936
00:40:21,486 --> 00:40:23,853
There was a smell.

937
00:40:23,922 --> 00:40:26,355
Look, apple slices.

938
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:29,459
Probably with peanut
butter on them at one point.

939
00:40:29,527 --> 00:40:31,828
I found them in
Tuck's soccer bag,

940
00:40:31,896 --> 00:40:33,930
and he hasn't been
to soccer in weeks.

941
00:40:33,998 --> 00:40:37,232
So, you know, God knows how
long they've been rotting in there.

942
00:40:38,736 --> 00:40:40,102
Miranda, I...

943
00:40:40,171 --> 00:40:41,871
Everything's fine.

944
00:40:46,828 --> 00:40:48,394
<i>You stand strong,</i>

945
00:40:48,462 --> 00:40:51,597
<i>keep pushing yourself
past all rational limits.</i>

946
00:40:53,801 --> 00:40:55,935
<i>And never let yourself give up.</i>

947
00:40:56,004 --> 00:40:58,437
Hey, how did the surgery go?

948
00:40:58,506 --> 00:41:00,033
I could have
gotten number eight.

949
00:41:00,057 --> 00:41:01,724
Would you believe
me if I told you that

950
00:41:01,793 --> 00:41:03,593
I could have gotten
number eight?

951
00:41:03,662 --> 00:41:06,357
Of course. You wouldn't
say you could if you couldn't.

952
00:41:06,381 --> 00:41:08,425
Now, would it cheer
you up if I told you

953
00:41:08,449 --> 00:41:11,395
I changed the face of
the face of the 3D printer?

954
00:41:11,419 --> 00:41:13,086
No, because I'll
miss his twitch.

955
00:41:15,090 --> 00:41:16,388
You know what this is?

956
00:41:16,457 --> 00:41:17,756
Yes, it's a fork.

957
00:41:17,825 --> 00:41:19,620
No, it's the future.

958
00:41:19,644 --> 00:41:22,228
Go watch your liver model.
I'm gonna put the kids down.

959
00:41:30,138 --> 00:41:32,818
<i>But the truth of
the matter is...</i>

960
00:41:40,681 --> 00:41:41,948
What the hell are you doing?

961
00:41:44,803 --> 00:41:46,669
<i>Despite how hard you try</i>

962
00:41:54,979 --> 00:41:57,246
<i>and fight to stay in control,</i>

963
00:42:10,294 --> 00:42:11,894
<i>when it's all said and done,</i>

964
00:42:17,135 --> 00:42:19,255
<i>sometimes you're
just outnumbered.</i>
