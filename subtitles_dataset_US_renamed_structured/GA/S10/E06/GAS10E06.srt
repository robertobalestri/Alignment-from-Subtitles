1
00:00:02,403 --> 00:00:03,981
<i>Researchers are
currently working</i>

2
00:00:04,005 --> 00:00:07,039
<i>to make a map of
the human brain.</i>

3
00:00:08,476 --> 00:00:11,443
<i>It may be the most
complex map ever created.</i>

4
00:00:11,512 --> 00:00:13,290
Good morning. Good morning.

5
00:00:13,314 --> 00:00:16,114
<i>Billions of neurons making
trillions of connections.</i>

6
00:00:16,183 --> 00:00:17,749
Hey.

7
00:00:21,639 --> 00:00:24,256
<i>At first glance, they
seem completely random.</i>

8
00:00:34,268 --> 00:00:35,283
Careful. Hot.

9
00:00:37,488 --> 00:00:38,853
Hmm.

10
00:00:38,922 --> 00:00:41,082
<i>But there is nothing
random about them.</i>

11
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:46,161
<i>All these connections
have to happen</i>

12
00:00:47,598 --> 00:00:48,814
<i>in a specific pattern.</i>

13
00:00:51,652 --> 00:00:53,886
<i>It is designed for a function.</i>

14
00:00:57,024 --> 00:01:00,325
<i>These connections
determine everything about us,</i>

15
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:03,394
<i>what we love,</i>

16
00:01:03,463 --> 00:01:05,430
<i>what we hate,</i>

17
00:01:05,499 --> 00:01:06,715
<i>what we say,</i>

18
00:01:06,783 --> 00:01:09,151
<i>what we do...</i>

19
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:11,619
Every action we take.

20
00:01:11,688 --> 00:01:13,922
Open your hand, okay, Mickey?

21
00:01:18,729 --> 00:01:19,895
Like this?

22
00:01:19,964 --> 00:01:21,613
Exactly. Like that.

23
00:01:21,682 --> 00:01:23,531
Yeah, baby!

24
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,650
Okay, now close it.

25
00:01:24,718 --> 00:01:26,418
Oh, yeah!

26
00:01:26,487 --> 00:01:27,719
As he thinks about movements,

27
00:01:27,788 --> 00:01:29,199
we see brain activity
here and here.

28
00:01:30,557 --> 00:01:31,889
These areas lighting up.

29
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:33,425
Now the brain-computer interface

30
00:01:33,493 --> 00:01:34,971
is the key to new possibilities,

31
00:01:34,995 --> 00:01:36,678
whether it be
robotic prosthetics,

32
00:01:36,747 --> 00:01:38,396
for quadriplegics like Mickey...

33
00:01:38,465 --> 00:01:40,465
Or letting me kick
ass at <i>Tetris</i> again.

34
00:01:40,534 --> 00:01:42,045
Hey, check this out, you guys.

35
00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:43,669
Hang loose!

36
00:01:48,291 --> 00:01:49,658
Hey, where's Dr. Torres?

37
00:01:49,726 --> 00:01:52,138
How's she missing this? This
is the best that we've ever done.

38
00:01:52,162 --> 00:01:54,122
Shane, text her again, will you?

39
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:57,694
Is something wrong?
There's not a lot

40
00:01:57,718 --> 00:01:58,829
of temporal lobe activity.

41
00:01:58,853 --> 00:02:00,235
Nothing lights up here.

42
00:02:00,303 --> 00:02:01,481
Is it a bad connection
in the sensor?

43
00:02:01,505 --> 00:02:02,620
I hope so.

44
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:04,350
If not, it's a bad
connection in his brain.

45
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:06,224
Schedule Mickey for an MRI.

46
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:07,342
Oh, um...

47
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:09,622
I brought this from
home accidentally.

48
00:02:09,646 --> 00:02:11,323
Can you just put it in with
my diaper bag and stuff?

49
00:02:11,347 --> 00:02:13,916
And, uh, I'll try
and find Torres.

50
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,418
What's up, second year?

51
00:02:17,487 --> 00:02:19,382
This is a step up, right?
Are these assigned?

52
00:02:19,406 --> 00:02:22,007
Yes. There's a lab
coat with your name.

53
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:23,603
What are you so happy about?

54
00:02:23,627 --> 00:02:25,388
Can't tell you. You
wish I could, but I can't.

55
00:02:25,412 --> 00:02:27,440
So please don't ask.

56
00:02:27,464 --> 00:02:29,092
Why are there no doors
on these? I know, right?

57
00:02:29,116 --> 00:02:31,316
Like, "Hello, tampons.
Meet everyone."

58
00:02:37,224 --> 00:02:39,841
You guys, there's a coat
here for Heather Brooks.

59
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:41,750
Oh, my God. Seriously?

60
00:02:44,614 --> 00:02:46,164
Okay, is he being weird?

61
00:02:46,233 --> 00:02:47,516
Did he fail the exam?

62
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:49,095
He left right after. He
didn't come celebrate.

63
00:02:49,119 --> 00:02:50,351
Also, he kissed me.

64
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,931
Oh, yeah, he kissed her.

65
00:02:51,955 --> 00:02:53,538
It could be that.

66
00:02:53,606 --> 00:02:56,341
I totally get it. I've got a
secret thing going, too.

67
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:59,177
There's no coffee
here. This is bad.

68
00:02:59,246 --> 00:03:00,846
I can't tell you who
kissed me, though.

69
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:03,676
Hey.

70
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,845
Hey! I woke up at your place...

71
00:03:05,869 --> 00:03:07,013
<i>Alone, again.</i>

72
00:03:07,037 --> 00:03:08,165
Yeah, I was out late.

73
00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:09,548
This has been three nights now.

74
00:03:10,975 --> 00:03:12,908
Yeah, I've been
going out. That's all.

75
00:03:12,977 --> 00:03:16,277
I passed my intern exam.
I never heard from you.

76
00:03:16,346 --> 00:03:17,829
Is there something going on?

77
00:03:17,898 --> 00:03:20,165
Alex, talk to me.

78
00:03:20,234 --> 00:03:21,567
Alex?

79
00:03:29,426 --> 00:03:31,292
Ugh. I thought she
would never leave.

80
00:03:31,361 --> 00:03:32,477
Hmm?

81
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:33,546
So you got my texts?

82
00:03:33,597 --> 00:03:34,696
I passed my intern exam.

83
00:03:34,764 --> 00:03:36,475
Yeah, yeah, I did. I replied.

84
00:03:36,499 --> 00:03:39,050
I wrote "congratulations."

85
00:03:39,119 --> 00:03:40,735
I hoped I would see you.

86
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:43,104
I had such an amazing
time the other night.

87
00:03:43,173 --> 00:03:44,438
Yeah, it was fun.

88
00:03:44,507 --> 00:03:48,126
I feel like I'm ready
to take it further...

89
00:03:48,194 --> 00:03:51,013
You know, um, it's
not a good idea...

90
00:03:51,081 --> 00:03:52,976
Um... At work?

91
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,149
I totally get it.

92
00:03:54,217 --> 00:03:55,767
See you tonight?

93
00:03:55,835 --> 00:03:57,269
Mmm-hmm.

94
00:04:00,774 --> 00:04:01,890
You paged me?

95
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:03,492
Dr. Edwards, Ben Bosco.

96
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,838
His wife Joyce. Hi.

97
00:04:04,862 --> 00:04:06,144
He's got an ankle fracture.

98
00:04:06,212 --> 00:04:07,591
That moving walkway
thing at the airport...

99
00:04:07,615 --> 00:04:10,281
We were running to catch
our connection to Alaska...

100
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:12,200
To see the northern lights.

101
00:04:12,268 --> 00:04:14,230
Then he steps off that
thing, and I heard it.

102
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:15,670
I heard it just go crack.

103
00:04:15,739 --> 00:04:18,167
Like the whole world slammed
on the brakes, and I kept going.

104
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:19,440
And here we are.

105
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:21,453
He's gonna need a full
workup and an ortho consult.

106
00:04:21,477 --> 00:04:23,289
Also get a chest X-ray,
'cause it might be surgical.

107
00:04:23,313 --> 00:04:25,446
Keep me posted.

108
00:04:25,516 --> 00:04:26,659
Okay. I will get those X-rays.

109
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:28,249
Oh! Excuse me. Sorry. Sorry.

110
00:04:28,318 --> 00:04:29,496
You're sure it's not weird?

111
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,986
I called you.

112
00:04:31,055 --> 00:04:32,398
Robbins doesn't know
that we're dating, does she?

113
00:04:32,422 --> 00:04:33,967
'Cause I just don't
want to trade on our,

114
00:04:33,991 --> 00:04:36,658
whatever this is, to get
to observe a surgery.

115
00:04:36,727 --> 00:04:38,259
No.

116
00:04:38,328 --> 00:04:39,539
Good. I just like to keep
it professional, you know?

117
00:04:39,563 --> 00:04:41,024
At work. Yeah, of course.

118
00:04:41,048 --> 00:04:43,181
Um, hey, uh...

119
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,984
Are we not telling people?
'Cause I told a couple people.

120
00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:48,003
Yeah, you could.

121
00:04:48,071 --> 00:04:49,304
You should.

122
00:04:49,373 --> 00:04:50,822
I would.

123
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:52,173
Good. Good.

124
00:04:52,242 --> 00:04:54,793
Well, we are at work. So...

125
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:56,406
Thanks for the call.

126
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:57,478
Yeah.

127
00:04:59,133 --> 00:05:01,173
Hi. Excuse me. Oh, hello.

128
00:05:02,953 --> 00:05:04,597
Bring your girlfriend
to work day?

129
00:05:04,621 --> 00:05:09,090
Robbins has a teratoma in a
three-month, and, uh, Emma...

130
00:05:09,159 --> 00:05:12,894
Doctor, uh, Marling
is gonna observe.

131
00:05:12,963 --> 00:05:15,130
That's sweet.

132
00:05:15,198 --> 00:05:16,409
This isn't gonna
be weird, is it?

133
00:05:16,433 --> 00:05:19,584
For me? Please.

134
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:20,935
Will it be weird for her?

135
00:05:21,004 --> 00:05:23,772
I mean is she the type to
get freaked out by the ex?

136
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,480
Damn it.

137
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:27,219
Mer...

138
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:28,443
What's going on?

139
00:05:30,147 --> 00:05:31,346
Oh, nothing.

140
00:05:31,415 --> 00:05:34,448
I'm just, uh, trying to
decide on a research project.

141
00:05:34,517 --> 00:05:36,534
Decide between what?

142
00:05:36,603 --> 00:05:37,986
Nothing. I got it.

143
00:05:41,575 --> 00:05:43,842
<i>This pain isn't going away.</i>

144
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:48,012
It's a constant pain
in my left shoulder.

145
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:50,148
And what do you
think is causing that?

146
00:05:50,217 --> 00:05:51,916
Were you injured in a fall?

147
00:05:51,985 --> 00:05:53,851
You tell me. You're my doctor.

148
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,670
Right. Sorry.

149
00:05:55,738 --> 00:05:57,516
It's just that you're
also my teacher.

150
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:00,475
Excuse me, Dr. Bailey...

151
00:06:00,543 --> 00:06:02,154
Do you remember
reading somewhere

152
00:06:02,178 --> 00:06:05,830
about unfinished research
on iliac-portal vein grafts?

153
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:07,476
Why? Tonight is the deadline

154
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,940
to submit for the NIH
research grant I want.

155
00:06:10,003 --> 00:06:11,581
And I'm having trouble
deciding between ischemia...

156
00:06:11,605 --> 00:06:13,599
Ah, you're peeing on a tree.

157
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:17,024
Yeah, first year attending
scared of screwing up.

158
00:06:17,093 --> 00:06:19,060
So, she takes the easy cases.

159
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:20,811
She keeps a low profile.

160
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,892
But second year attending
has got to step it up,

161
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:25,784
take the flashy cases,
publish the research,

162
00:06:25,853 --> 00:06:28,114
mark her territory.
Pee on some trees.

163
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:30,149
Portal veins... Any bells?

164
00:06:30,173 --> 00:06:33,258
It was your mother's.

165
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:36,261
"Portal vein interposition
with iliac vein graft."

166
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:38,546
Ellis was working on
it when she got sick.

167
00:06:38,615 --> 00:06:40,593
It's in one of the
journals you gave me. Oh.

168
00:06:40,617 --> 00:06:42,517
Crap.

169
00:06:43,687 --> 00:06:45,537
I have a mug like that.

170
00:06:45,606 --> 00:06:47,250
If you don't come back
with a solid diagnosis

171
00:06:47,274 --> 00:06:50,124
for my shoulder pain, I'm
gonna kick you off my case.

172
00:06:50,193 --> 00:06:52,460
As my teacher or my patient?

173
00:06:52,529 --> 00:06:53,861
Get out.

174
00:06:58,235 --> 00:07:00,913
I need a differential diagnosis
for Webber's shoulder pain.

175
00:07:00,937 --> 00:07:02,637
Arthritis, bursitis...

176
00:07:02,705 --> 00:07:04,017
Hmm. Any of the
old people "-itises."

177
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:07,125
Still waiting on my
broken ankle's chest scans.

178
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:08,826
You got coffee.

179
00:07:08,895 --> 00:07:11,173
So Alex isn't talking to me.

180
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:13,659
I think it's 'cause I pushed
him to talk to his deadbeat dad.

181
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:15,427
Alex has a dad? Mmm.

182
00:07:15,451 --> 00:07:16,579
Have you talked to Shane?

183
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:17,630
I'm still hoping it'll go away.

184
00:07:17,654 --> 00:07:18,798
Shane kissed me.
I didn't kiss him.

185
00:07:18,822 --> 00:07:19,899
It's his problem.

186
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:22,674
Oh...

187
00:07:23,444 --> 00:07:25,043
Oh!

188
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:27,646
He has a huge
tumor in his heart.

189
00:07:27,714 --> 00:07:29,147
No...

190
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:32,249
He has a broken ankle.

191
00:07:45,265 --> 00:07:46,609
Okay, yeah. Thank you.

192
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:47,732
You okay?

193
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,844
Yeah, why?

194
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:50,045
Yeah, we tested the new sensors

195
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:51,214
with Mickey
Wenschler this morning.

196
00:07:51,238 --> 00:07:52,548
Oh. And it was a huge success.

197
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:54,067
But he kept asking
why you weren't there.

198
00:07:54,091 --> 00:07:56,842
Uh, well, didn't
you get my text?

199
00:07:56,894 --> 00:07:58,037
Your text said,
"Won't be there."

200
00:07:58,061 --> 00:08:00,995
Okay, well, uh,
here's the thing,

201
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:02,775
moving back into my
place made me feel like

202
00:08:02,799 --> 00:08:05,166
I really need to move
back into my place.

203
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:06,829
You know, concentrate
on what makes me, me.

204
00:08:06,853 --> 00:08:08,403
I do regenerative cartilage.

205
00:08:08,472 --> 00:08:09,916
It's what my TED talk was
about... What are you saying?

206
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,167
I'm not going forward
with the project.

207
00:08:11,191 --> 00:08:12,752
You should totally
run with it, though.

208
00:08:12,776 --> 00:08:13,886
No, this is your project.

209
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,338
Mickey's your
patient. I can't do this.

210
00:08:15,362 --> 00:08:16,706
I don't have time.
Meredith and I

211
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:18,007
are in over our heads with kids,

212
00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:19,125
and she needs time, too.

213
00:08:19,149 --> 00:08:20,198
So maybe we just drop it.

214
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,549
No harm done, right?

215
00:08:21,618 --> 00:08:22,567
Oh, and tell that to
Mickey Wenschler.

216
00:08:22,619 --> 00:08:23,668
Mickey will be all right.

217
00:08:23,736 --> 00:08:25,303
Edwards, I just saw
your broken ankle.

218
00:08:25,372 --> 00:08:26,805
No surgery, just splint it.

219
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:28,651
He won't be all right.
It's gonna kill him.

220
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:30,324
I know, right?

221
00:08:33,046 --> 00:08:34,345
I can't do this.

222
00:08:34,414 --> 00:08:35,925
Did you do this? Uh, I...

223
00:08:35,949 --> 00:08:37,777
I need to find Kepner.
No, who broke this?

224
00:08:37,801 --> 00:08:39,867
Yeah, sorry. I dropped it.

225
00:08:39,937 --> 00:08:42,136
Dr. Yang, would
you look at this?

226
00:08:42,222 --> 00:08:43,783
Holy... Wow! I
mean, it's bad, right?

227
00:08:43,807 --> 00:08:45,651
Look, this wasn't yours
to use... Shane, not now!

228
00:08:45,675 --> 00:08:48,037
This is a rat's nest of an
AVM in the left ventricle.

229
00:08:48,061 --> 00:08:49,789
It's probably pushing
in on the valve.

230
00:08:49,813 --> 00:08:51,374
If it's not treated, he'll
be dead in months.

231
00:08:51,398 --> 00:08:53,848
He came in for a broken ankle.

232
00:08:53,934 --> 00:08:58,086
And now I have to
tell them he's dying.

233
00:08:58,154 --> 00:09:01,856
Okay, let me look at the blood
work, and we'll tell them together.

234
00:09:01,942 --> 00:09:04,209
God, thank you so much.

235
00:09:04,278 --> 00:09:06,677
This place is a maze.

236
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:07,879
Is that Dr. Robbins?

237
00:09:07,948 --> 00:09:09,014
Yeah.

238
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:10,193
And you are?

239
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:12,417
Dr. Robbins, Emma Marling.

240
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:13,868
Oh, right.

241
00:09:13,936 --> 00:09:15,481
Right, right, you're observing.
And I'm scrubbing in...

242
00:09:15,505 --> 00:09:17,288
I hope. Oh.

243
00:09:17,357 --> 00:09:19,524
Murphy, I'm sorry.
With Dr. Marling,

244
00:09:19,593 --> 00:09:21,676
I think the table's
full. Um, next time?

245
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:24,295
Okay, so we just gave little
Erin's parents the pre-game,

246
00:09:24,364 --> 00:09:25,808
and we're about to take her up.

247
00:09:25,832 --> 00:09:28,312
Murphy, will you show her
where to get some scrubs?

248
00:09:30,687 --> 00:09:31,986
Visiting surgeon?

249
00:09:32,055 --> 00:09:33,833
Yeah, maternal/fetal.

250
00:09:33,857 --> 00:09:36,641
She's researching minimally
invasive in-utero teratomas.

251
00:09:36,693 --> 00:09:41,295
And she's hot. I'm just saying it's
good that I'll be there to chaperone.

252
00:09:41,365 --> 00:09:43,614
What, we're not
joking about this yet?

253
00:09:44,567 --> 00:09:47,184
See you in there.

254
00:09:50,223 --> 00:09:51,939
Here.

255
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:53,653
This is my mother's journal.
Where did you get this?

256
00:09:53,677 --> 00:09:55,855
Webber made me go to his house.

257
00:09:55,879 --> 00:09:57,122
And I need to figure out
why his shoulder hurts.

258
00:09:57,146 --> 00:09:58,780
Can I go? Yeah.

259
00:10:00,116 --> 00:10:01,777
What was that about?
Research funding.

260
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:04,079
I'm trying to decide
between an ischemia study

261
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:07,499
and this portal vein thing that
my mother was working on.

262
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:08,573
Ooh! Do that.

263
00:10:08,642 --> 00:10:10,041
It's half-baked.

264
00:10:10,093 --> 00:10:11,137
And I don't like trading
on my mother's name.

265
00:10:11,161 --> 00:10:13,445
No, it's your story. Yeah.

266
00:10:13,513 --> 00:10:15,040
"Brilliant young
surgeon finishes work

267
00:10:15,064 --> 00:10:16,504
"of dead brilliant
mother surgeon,"

268
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:18,582
it writes itself.
Invest in your brand.

269
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:20,630
You make me sound like a
soft drink. That's what I'm doing.

270
00:10:20,654 --> 00:10:22,354
Yeah, I'm reinvesting in myself.

271
00:10:22,406 --> 00:10:23,566
That's the perfect
reason... Right?

272
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:24,630
Not to.

273
00:10:24,658 --> 00:10:26,024
Shane, here you go.

274
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:27,492
Some good stuff in there.

275
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:28,943
Enjoy.

276
00:10:29,846 --> 00:10:31,095
You don't get it.

277
00:10:32,749 --> 00:10:34,909
These are Mickey's
MRIs? Mmm-hmm.

278
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:38,085
Dr. Shepherd, I
wondered if you'd mind

279
00:10:38,154 --> 00:10:40,121
if I switch services
after today.

280
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:42,390
I asked for you specifically.

281
00:10:42,476 --> 00:10:43,892
I know.

282
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,371
Look, what happened last
year between you and Brooks,

283
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:47,006
I think I may have been unfair,

284
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:48,824
and I was hoping for a
chance to make it right.

285
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:52,216
So, now that Brooks is gone,

286
00:10:52,285 --> 00:10:54,047
I get to take her
place? Oh, hell.

287
00:10:54,071 --> 00:10:57,271
Well, that's why the
sensors weren't lighting.

288
00:10:57,357 --> 00:10:58,389
He has a glioma.

289
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:00,608
Can you treat it?

290
00:11:00,694 --> 00:11:01,904
I could try hitting
it with some glue.

291
00:11:01,928 --> 00:11:03,361
Glue?

292
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:04,840
Embolization glue.
We use it for AVMs.

293
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:06,426
We pump superglue
into the vessels,

294
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:09,066
the glue hardens, cuts
off blood to the tumor.

295
00:11:09,119 --> 00:11:11,336
I could try it.

296
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:12,982
No. It goes all the
way to the brain stem.

297
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:15,051
It's too dangerous.
And going in surgically?

298
00:11:15,075 --> 00:11:16,274
It's the same thing.

299
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:18,223
I'm afraid of doing
more harm than good.

300
00:11:18,812 --> 00:11:21,112
It's a very deadly mass.

301
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:24,381
It's a large veinous
malformation,

302
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:26,195
and without
intervention immediately,

303
00:11:26,219 --> 00:11:28,469
I'm afraid the
prognosis is very bad.

304
00:11:28,555 --> 00:11:31,455
Yeah, that's the thing.

305
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:34,041
Um, I have been
dying of that for years.

306
00:11:36,113 --> 00:11:37,757
You knew about this
and you didn't mention it?

307
00:11:37,781 --> 00:11:39,241
I'm sorry. In your
medical history, there's...

308
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:41,243
I was so hung up on
missing our plane...

309
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:43,050
It's an inoperable AVM.

310
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,186
He was diagnosed
with it, what...

311
00:11:45,255 --> 00:11:46,933
A year and a half...
Year before last, yeah.

312
00:11:46,957 --> 00:11:48,801
January. And terminal.

313
00:11:48,825 --> 00:11:50,408
So, what are you gonna do?

314
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:53,094
So we just quit our jobs,
cashed out all our accounts,

315
00:11:53,163 --> 00:11:54,362
and just started traveling.

316
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:56,597
Yeah, just doing stuff,

317
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:59,228
trips, activities, basically
cramming as much living

318
00:11:59,252 --> 00:12:01,619
as we could into
the time we have left.

319
00:12:01,671 --> 00:12:03,815
Okay, did your
doctor, did he or she,

320
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:05,952
try treating it with radiation?

321
00:12:05,976 --> 00:12:07,770
Yeah, tried that.
Intravenous coiling?

322
00:12:07,794 --> 00:12:09,693
Mmm-hmm. Yeah, no dice.

323
00:12:09,763 --> 00:12:11,429
And the sclerosing agents...

324
00:12:11,497 --> 00:12:13,242
Uh, what about a
transplant? Or what about...

325
00:12:13,266 --> 00:12:15,033
There are a lot of...

326
00:12:15,102 --> 00:12:17,202
Sweetie...

327
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:18,719
I know it's hard.

328
00:12:18,805 --> 00:12:20,705
It was hard for us, too.

329
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:23,441
But you have to let it go.

330
00:12:25,028 --> 00:12:26,639
<i>Because there is
nothing I can do about it.</i>

331
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:27,862
I'm sorry.

332
00:12:27,931 --> 00:12:30,098
The best course
is to leave it alone

333
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,716
and hope for the best.

334
00:12:31,785 --> 00:12:33,596
We'll keep doing
the study, right?

335
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:34,935
Come on. Why?

336
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:36,303
Because it is too dangerous.

337
00:12:36,373 --> 00:12:38,873
Also the tumor could
give us abnormal results.

338
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:40,770
What if you take the tumor out?

339
00:12:40,794 --> 00:12:42,071
I could keep doing the testing.

340
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:43,227
You could, but...

341
00:12:43,296 --> 00:12:44,745
Then take it out, man!

342
00:12:44,831 --> 00:12:46,341
We're so close, right? Mmm-hmm.

343
00:12:46,365 --> 00:12:49,450
This morning, I was
miles beyond anything...

344
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,085
It's too dangerous.

345
00:12:51,154 --> 00:12:53,249
We're gonna take you up there,
we're gonna remove your sensors,

346
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:54,300
and then we're
gonna close your...

347
00:12:54,324 --> 00:12:55,367
What if I don't consent?

348
00:12:55,391 --> 00:12:56,441
What?

349
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:59,043
What if I say you can't
take your sensors back

350
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:01,207
unless you take my tumor, too?

351
00:13:01,231 --> 00:13:02,630
Mickey, I need to take them out.

352
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:04,299
Sorry, bud.

353
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:06,401
Access denied.

354
00:13:06,469 --> 00:13:09,869
You're not going in my head
unless you're leaving with that tumor.

355
00:13:14,327 --> 00:13:16,088
Lucky you use
electro-thermal sealers.

356
00:13:16,112 --> 00:13:18,558
They're too big to get in there
when we do these in-utero.

357
00:13:18,582 --> 00:13:20,448
Bear with me, Emma.
Alex, I need your advice.

358
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:22,461
What's your strategy when
you have a one-night-stand,

359
00:13:22,485 --> 00:13:24,918
not even, you just
make out with someone,

360
00:13:24,987 --> 00:13:26,199
and then they get
way too attached?

361
00:13:26,223 --> 00:13:28,122
You know who's like that?

362
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:29,311
Leah Murphy.

363
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:30,808
Really?

364
00:13:30,877 --> 00:13:32,688
Yeah, I slept with her
one, maybe two times.

365
00:13:32,712 --> 00:13:34,595
She stuck to me like glue.

366
00:13:34,664 --> 00:13:37,526
That girl goes from zero to
"I love you" in seven seconds.

367
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:39,950
I've never, ever felt this way.

368
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,597
And if I tell you
guys who it is,

369
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:43,203
it would cause so
many problems for me

370
00:13:43,273 --> 00:13:45,389
and for this person, and...

371
00:13:45,442 --> 00:13:47,942
God, for the hospital, probably.

372
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:49,193
So please don't ask.

373
00:13:49,246 --> 00:13:50,423
Could it be heart-related?

374
00:13:50,447 --> 00:13:52,313
He had ventricular failure.
- What?

375
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:53,898
Webber's shoulder hurts.

376
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:55,177
Hey, did you talk to Alex?

377
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:57,184
Yeah, I tried. He just
keeps running away.

378
00:13:57,254 --> 00:13:59,504
He's dumping you.
It's what he did with me.

379
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:01,734
He'll pretend you're not
there until you're not there.

380
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:04,558
And when you're not there,
he'll have sex with someone else.

381
00:14:04,628 --> 00:14:05,868
Why are you gluing my mug?

382
00:14:05,912 --> 00:14:07,056
It's not yours. It's Shepherd's.

383
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,479
The mug was my responsibility.

384
00:14:08,548 --> 00:14:10,409
How'd you break it? She
got scared by a tumor.

385
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:13,368
It's an AVM, and
it's a scary one.

386
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:14,676
Totally inoperable.

387
00:14:14,737 --> 00:14:16,248
Guy probably has months to live,

388
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:17,583
and he and his poor
wife are just trying to make

389
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:19,727
the most of their time together.

390
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:29,367
Hey, what about glue?

391
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:31,051
What about glue?

392
00:14:31,121 --> 00:14:32,686
I'm sorry. For your AVM...

393
00:14:32,772 --> 00:14:34,071
This AVM.

394
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,968
Look, Dr. Shepherd was talking
about the embolization glue

395
00:14:35,992 --> 00:14:38,025
they use in neuro
AVMs, and I wondered,

396
00:14:38,111 --> 00:14:40,044
has this approach ever
been used in the heart?

397
00:14:40,113 --> 00:14:43,397
Not that I'm aware of. So... No.

398
00:14:45,135 --> 00:14:47,535
They glue neuro AVMs
because they're microscopic.

399
00:14:47,604 --> 00:14:50,204
These vessels are huge.

400
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:51,539
You saying it won't work?

401
00:14:51,608 --> 00:14:52,840
I'm saying...

402
00:14:52,909 --> 00:14:55,209
I'd need a crapload of glue.

403
00:14:55,278 --> 00:14:57,878
I'm saying the glue won't
work, the radiation won't work,

404
00:14:57,947 --> 00:15:00,414
and I don't want to go in
surgically. I risk killing him.

405
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:02,962
So he's holding your
sensors hostage in his skull?

406
00:15:02,986 --> 00:15:05,303
This is not funny, Callie.
You have to talk to him.

407
00:15:05,355 --> 00:15:07,388
It's Mickey. Just
give him a few hours.

408
00:15:07,457 --> 00:15:08,822
He'll come around.

409
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:12,654
You don't want to talk to him

410
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:14,123
because you don't want
to look him in the eye

411
00:15:14,147 --> 00:15:15,730
and tell him you're
bailing on this.

412
00:15:15,815 --> 00:15:19,701
And you certainly don't want
to tell him why you're bailing.

413
00:15:23,907 --> 00:15:25,490
Why is that?

414
00:15:25,542 --> 00:15:27,975
You started this
project for Arizona.

415
00:15:28,044 --> 00:15:31,762
When you lost interest in
her, you lost interest in this.

416
00:15:31,831 --> 00:15:33,342
You're letting your
personal problems

417
00:15:33,366 --> 00:15:34,810
get in the way of
months of research.

418
00:15:34,834 --> 00:15:36,295
Well, you're doing
the same thing.

419
00:15:36,319 --> 00:15:38,831
You said you were done with the
study to spend time with your kids.

420
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:40,120
That's completely different.

421
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:41,650
Oh, why is it different, Derek?

422
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:43,703
'Cause your family's
perfect, and mine's a disaster?

423
00:15:43,727 --> 00:15:45,504
Because you're leaving the
study to support your wife,

424
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:46,622
and I'm doing it to forget mine?

425
00:15:46,646 --> 00:15:47,806
I know what you're
going through.

426
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:50,150
You don't know
anything about it.

427
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:52,178
You guys have figured it out,

428
00:15:52,202 --> 00:15:54,768
how to make the pieces fit.

429
00:15:54,837 --> 00:15:57,957
And I thought
we did, too, but...

430
00:15:58,491 --> 00:16:02,327
I'm figuring this out
for myself now, so...

431
00:16:02,395 --> 00:16:04,595
Just bear with me, okay?

432
00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:12,270
I will talk to Mickey.

433
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:16,207
And I'm gonna ask you
a series of questions.

434
00:16:16,276 --> 00:16:17,658
"Are you a tennis player?"

435
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:19,043
Oh, good lord.

436
00:16:19,095 --> 00:16:22,496
"Do you frequently
carry heavy loads,

437
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:24,882
"groceries, etcetera,
with your injured arm?"

438
00:16:24,934 --> 00:16:26,712
I've been in this bed a month.

439
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:28,819
I'm just trying to be thorough.

440
00:16:28,888 --> 00:16:30,337
Um...

441
00:16:30,407 --> 00:16:31,606
"Have you recently engaged

442
00:16:31,674 --> 00:16:33,290
in any strenuous sexual..."

443
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:34,842
I am skipping that one...

444
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:37,195
Uh, too, uh...

445
00:16:37,263 --> 00:16:38,496
Um...

446
00:16:39,949 --> 00:16:44,235
Uh... I'm not getting a
very good reading on...

447
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:45,636
Sir, are you... Oh! Oh...

448
00:16:45,705 --> 00:16:49,040
It is not my tennis game,
and it's not my heart.

449
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:50,641
Look deeper.

450
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:53,150
Now get out, and
take that thing with you.

451
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:58,516
Um...

452
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:07,224
Oh, come on. I don't
have time for this.

453
00:17:09,345 --> 00:17:12,363
"Ischemia reperfusion
injury in thoracic trauma"?

454
00:17:12,432 --> 00:17:13,909
What happened to portal veins?

455
00:17:13,933 --> 00:17:15,833
I know ischemia is boring,

456
00:17:15,902 --> 00:17:18,186
but my mother's portal
vein research is outdated.

457
00:17:18,271 --> 00:17:20,215
I mean, we've already
grafted them from stem cells.

458
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:23,218
And I don't want to spend my
life being compared to my mother.

459
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:24,709
Hey. She was a smart woman.

460
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:26,844
It might be worse to
never be compared to her.

461
00:17:26,913 --> 00:17:29,224
I can't find a way to
take the research further.

462
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:32,200
And I can't print
this damn thing!

463
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:40,458
You all right?

464
00:17:40,527 --> 00:17:44,912
We've bio-engineered blood
vessels from a 3-D printer.

465
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:46,530
Yeah.

466
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:51,268
But I don't think anyone
has ever printed a portal vein.

467
00:17:51,321 --> 00:17:53,887
It's never been done before.

468
00:17:53,956 --> 00:17:56,791
The glue is designed
for use in your brain,

469
00:17:56,859 --> 00:17:59,410
but I would like to
try it in your heart.

470
00:17:59,479 --> 00:18:00,945
It's a bold approach.

471
00:18:01,013 --> 00:18:02,546
Are you saying that...

472
00:18:02,615 --> 00:18:05,249
I am optimistic that
it could save your life.

473
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:08,092
That's awful.

474
00:18:08,972 --> 00:18:10,020
I'm sorry?

475
00:18:12,658 --> 00:18:14,992
After we got Ben's diagnosis,
well, I mean, you know,

476
00:18:15,061 --> 00:18:16,627
we sold everything.

477
00:18:16,696 --> 00:18:18,062
We cashed out all our accounts.

478
00:18:18,131 --> 00:18:21,298
We maxed out our credit
cards and more credit cards.

479
00:18:21,367 --> 00:18:24,697
We went to Europe. We went
to India. We went to Morocco.

480
00:18:24,721 --> 00:18:26,187
We rented a whole island.

481
00:18:26,255 --> 00:18:28,634
We went up in that plane
where you get to be weightless.

482
00:18:28,658 --> 00:18:29,940
That's five grand a pop.

483
00:18:30,009 --> 00:18:31,249
We went up 11 times...

484
00:18:31,311 --> 00:18:32,638
And then bought a boat.

485
00:18:32,662 --> 00:18:34,957
And then we blew it up, 'cause
we wanted to watch it burn.

486
00:18:34,981 --> 00:18:37,164
We owe creditors

487
00:18:37,232 --> 00:18:39,350
hundreds of
thousands of dollars.

488
00:18:39,402 --> 00:18:40,612
How were you
planning to pay for...

489
00:18:40,636 --> 00:18:41,830
Life insurance.

490
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:43,031
Ben's a very good planner.

491
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:44,133
I thought I was.

492
00:18:44,157 --> 00:18:46,597
I didn't plan for surviving.

493
00:18:47,076 --> 00:18:48,241
But still, hon...

494
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:49,409
Oh.

495
00:18:49,478 --> 00:18:52,997
We gotta try it, right?

496
00:18:54,601 --> 00:18:56,901
Wait.

497
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:58,469
What are the risks?

498
00:18:58,538 --> 00:19:00,505
Well, as I said,

499
00:19:00,573 --> 00:19:03,257
this has never been done
before on a beating heart.

500
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:04,574
Could I die?

501
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:07,945
Could I die on the table?

502
00:19:09,098 --> 00:19:11,966
It's possible.

503
00:19:12,051 --> 00:19:14,452
Then there's hope.

504
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:24,373
I want a C-arm set up in the OR.

505
00:19:24,397 --> 00:19:25,608
I may have to do
a crash sternotomy.

506
00:19:25,632 --> 00:19:26,930
Really?

507
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,177
Well, I don't know
what's gonna happen.

508
00:19:28,201 --> 00:19:29,411
This has never been done before.

509
00:19:29,435 --> 00:19:30,613
How much AVM glue
do you think we'll need?

510
00:19:30,637 --> 00:19:31,747
Again, never been done before.

511
00:19:31,771 --> 00:19:33,215
Err on the side of all of it.

512
00:19:33,239 --> 00:19:34,783
Where is it? Where is what?

513
00:19:34,807 --> 00:19:36,152
My mother's journal.
Why would I know?

514
00:19:36,176 --> 00:19:37,275
The black book...

515
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,787
The little black book
I gave you today...

516
00:19:38,811 --> 00:19:40,422
I need it back, Shane. I
think I left it with Edwards.

517
00:19:40,446 --> 00:19:41,774
Edwards! What?

518
00:19:41,798 --> 00:19:43,964
ER needs this bed.
Can you help me?

519
00:19:44,033 --> 00:19:45,733
Hey, and what is going
on with Mr. Bosco?

520
00:19:45,802 --> 00:19:48,285
Why has a broken ankle
been moved to pre-op

521
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:50,166
for a cardiac procedure? What?

522
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:52,670
You can't change the course
of treatment like that without...

523
00:19:52,725 --> 00:19:55,409
I didn't. The cardio consult
declared it inoperable.

524
00:19:55,478 --> 00:19:56,978
So then why is he in pre-op?

525
00:19:57,046 --> 00:19:59,146
Who did the consult? Dr. Yang!

526
00:19:59,232 --> 00:20:00,975
What? EMMA: Sorry.
We were in here before,

527
00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:04,335
and I think I left my phone.

528
00:20:04,404 --> 00:20:05,969
Well, what do we have here?

529
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:07,349
Oh, a ventricular AVM.

530
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:10,390
I'm doing liquid
embolization with glue.

531
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,509
Wait, glue for brain aneurysms?

532
00:20:12,579 --> 00:20:15,746
Has that been tried
on a heart before?

533
00:20:15,815 --> 00:20:19,566
Thank you. As a
matter of fact, no.

534
00:20:19,636 --> 00:20:21,234
Are you sure it'll work?

535
00:20:21,304 --> 00:20:23,087
That is also a no.

536
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:26,573
I am impressed with
your enormous balls.

537
00:20:26,643 --> 00:20:29,777
I wish I could stick
around and watch this.

538
00:20:29,846 --> 00:20:31,462
I'm Cristina by the way.

539
00:20:31,514 --> 00:20:35,032
Cristina Yang. Just so you know.

540
00:20:35,101 --> 00:20:37,935
Yeah, I know. We've met
a couple of times, actually.

541
00:20:38,004 --> 00:20:39,202
Emma Marling.

542
00:20:39,272 --> 00:20:42,306
I know. I'm saying
I'm Owen's, um...

543
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:46,710
Ex-wife.

544
00:20:46,779 --> 00:20:49,280
Ah! Yes.

545
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:51,815
Right.

546
00:20:51,868 --> 00:20:53,967
Well, this looks amazing.

547
00:20:54,037 --> 00:20:56,670
And I can't wait to
hear how it went.

548
00:20:58,391 --> 00:20:59,673
Good night.

549
00:21:01,344 --> 00:21:03,188
You weren't gonna
say good night? Oh, hey.

550
00:21:03,212 --> 00:21:04,945
I'm off. I'll see you later.

551
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:06,479
Will you?

552
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,716
Probably not. I'll
probably be late.

553
00:21:09,802 --> 00:21:11,113
Are you seeing someone else?

554
00:21:11,137 --> 00:21:12,447
Is that what's happening?

555
00:21:12,471 --> 00:21:14,283
'Cause I just need to
know. No, it's not that.

556
00:21:14,307 --> 00:21:15,522
Then what is it?

557
00:21:16,826 --> 00:21:19,076
It's none of your business.

558
00:21:19,145 --> 00:21:20,789
<i>It is between me and Shepherd,</i>

559
00:21:20,813 --> 00:21:23,463
and I told him everything
he needs to know.

560
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:26,216
Mickey... Mickey, look at me.

561
00:21:26,286 --> 00:21:28,802
If I do, the aliens will win.

562
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,393
This operation could kill you.

563
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:44,918
I never told you how I
became a quad, did I?

564
00:21:45,004 --> 00:21:48,872
You were in a car accident.

565
00:21:52,194 --> 00:21:54,612
I caused a car accident...

566
00:21:56,549 --> 00:21:58,916
Because I was
drunk. I got drunk,

567
00:21:58,985 --> 00:22:01,285
and I drove, and
I hit another car,

568
00:22:01,353 --> 00:22:04,188
and I killed two teenage girls,

569
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:06,756
Lindsay and Cheryl.

570
00:22:08,761 --> 00:22:10,773
So, there I am,
a pile of garbage.

571
00:22:10,797 --> 00:22:12,574
Can't move, can't
walk, can't do anything

572
00:22:12,598 --> 00:22:17,067
except think about what
I did to those families.

573
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:23,907
I've got people tending to me.

574
00:22:23,976 --> 00:22:25,442
People feed me

575
00:22:25,511 --> 00:22:28,312
and shave me and clean me,

576
00:22:28,381 --> 00:22:29,557
and I don't deserve their time.

577
00:22:29,581 --> 00:22:33,651
I deserve to have
died in that car.

578
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:37,399
And I wish I did every day,

579
00:22:37,423 --> 00:22:39,039
for nine years.

580
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:44,277
And when you
asked me to do this...

581
00:22:46,716 --> 00:22:49,984
When I had a chance
to do something

582
00:22:50,052 --> 00:22:52,987
affecting someone
in a good way...

583
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:59,759
For the first time, I thought
I was worth having around.

584
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:04,314
If I die,

585
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:08,401
give my brain to
science, and I still help.

586
00:23:11,391 --> 00:23:14,057
Let me help.

587
00:23:15,995 --> 00:23:17,677
Please.

588
00:23:19,198 --> 00:23:20,581
<i>And how can I help you?</i>

589
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:23,317
Oh, hey. Same as last night?

590
00:23:23,403 --> 00:23:25,302
Yeah, thanks.

591
00:23:31,861 --> 00:23:34,101
You must really
like these guys, huh?

592
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:54,642
I still think it's a bad idea.

593
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:56,967
I know, but it's the right idea.

594
00:23:57,035 --> 00:23:59,052
Mickey has nothing
to lose and a lot to gain.

595
00:24:01,256 --> 00:24:03,657
Okay, I'll schedule him
for tomorrow morning.

596
00:24:03,726 --> 00:24:04,869
Okay. No, wait. I can't do

597
00:24:04,893 --> 00:24:06,789
tomorrow morning.

598
00:24:06,813 --> 00:24:10,181
Bailey has a well-baby exam,
I've got back-to-back discotomies,

599
00:24:10,233 --> 00:24:12,193
and Zola and I were gonna
check out a dance class.

600
00:24:12,217 --> 00:24:14,430
It's gonna have to be tonight.

601
00:24:14,454 --> 00:24:16,198
Zola, you and your brother
are gonna have to go back

602
00:24:16,222 --> 00:24:17,649
to day care for a little
while longer, okay, sweetie?

603
00:24:17,673 --> 00:24:19,823
No, no, no. I'll take
'em back up. I got it.

604
00:24:19,892 --> 00:24:21,441
Here. Come on. This way, babes.

605
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:22,976
Page Dr. Ross.

606
00:24:23,045 --> 00:24:24,144
Okay.

607
00:24:28,951 --> 00:24:30,300
More glue.

608
00:24:30,369 --> 00:24:31,897
We're getting to the
end of our supply.

609
00:24:31,921 --> 00:24:33,115
Then go get more.

610
00:24:33,139 --> 00:24:35,366
I think I need to
fill this whole thing.

611
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:39,910
Okay. The catheter
is stuck to the vein.

612
00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:41,506
God, this stuff is intense.

613
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:42,791
Should you be tugging that hard?

614
00:24:42,815 --> 00:24:45,135
Well, you want me
to leave it in there?

615
00:24:47,753 --> 00:24:50,020
Okay. Okay, we're good.

616
00:24:50,088 --> 00:24:51,749
How did you come up with this?

617
00:24:51,773 --> 00:24:52,973
I don't know.

618
00:24:53,041 --> 00:24:54,741
I just connected the dots.

619
00:24:54,810 --> 00:24:56,154
You are full of
surprises, sharky.

620
00:24:57,497 --> 00:25:00,430
Innovative instincts
and killer instincts,

621
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,744
what other secrets
are hiding in there?

622
00:25:02,768 --> 00:25:04,585
<i>What do you think you'll find?</i>

623
00:25:04,654 --> 00:25:07,505
Well, if it's not arthritis
or bursitis or rotator cuff,

624
00:25:07,573 --> 00:25:09,852
and your heart's
fine, then it can't hurt.

625
00:25:09,876 --> 00:25:12,254
Unless it's referred pain, which
could be nerve impingement

626
00:25:12,278 --> 00:25:14,811
or diaphragmatic
irritation, so...

627
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:19,549
You don't need an X-ray.

628
00:25:19,602 --> 00:25:21,385
Bravo.

629
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:24,538
You need an ultrasound.

630
00:25:27,242 --> 00:25:29,809
Well, I hope you're not
thinking I'm pregnant!

631
00:25:29,878 --> 00:25:31,589
Page Dr. Edwards here stat.
- Right away.

632
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:32,730
I need an ultrasound.

633
00:25:32,782 --> 00:25:34,576
Are you pregnant?
Does Alex know?

634
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,967
No, I need an
ultrasound machine.

635
00:25:37,036 --> 00:25:38,129
Have you seen Edwards?

636
00:25:38,153 --> 00:25:39,353
Does Alex think I'm pregnant?

637
00:25:41,757 --> 00:25:43,657
I have a mug like that.

638
00:25:46,212 --> 00:25:47,812
<i>Where the hell have you been?</i>

639
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,124
Uh, I thought you were leaving,

640
00:25:50,148 --> 00:25:52,076
and Dr. Yang and I
found a left ventricle AVM.

641
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,929
Yeah, well, you're
here now. Scrub in.

642
00:25:53,953 --> 00:25:55,193
I'd rather not.

643
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:58,205
Shane, you gotta get past this.

644
00:25:58,274 --> 00:25:59,673
You're not a consolation prize.

645
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:01,475
You deserve to be here.

646
00:26:01,561 --> 00:26:03,928
Brooks had a gift
that needed to be...

647
00:26:03,996 --> 00:26:05,923
I don't wanna work with you.

648
00:26:05,947 --> 00:26:07,881
I'm not interested.

649
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:09,733
Can I be more clear?

650
00:26:11,053 --> 00:26:12,652
I suppose not.

651
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:15,371
Go.

652
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:22,757
To a certain
extent, time will tell.

653
00:26:22,781 --> 00:26:26,650
What we know for sure is we've
done no damage to your heart,

654
00:26:26,718 --> 00:26:28,496
and at this preliminary stage,

655
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:32,689
it appears the AVM
won't continue to grow.

656
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:35,108
So you're saying...

657
00:26:35,177 --> 00:26:37,194
I'll live?

658
00:26:37,263 --> 00:26:38,789
Yes. Mmm-hmm.

659
00:26:38,813 --> 00:26:39,847
Dear God.

660
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:44,501
Ben? Honey? I know.

661
00:26:44,569 --> 00:26:45,952
We'll be all right.

662
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:49,273
I know it's a lot of money.
It's been a crazy year,

663
00:26:49,342 --> 00:26:52,425
but the world is a lot
more fun with you in it.

664
00:26:52,494 --> 00:26:55,228
As long as we have each
other, everything will be fine.

665
00:26:55,314 --> 00:26:56,613
Joyce, we're screwed.

666
00:26:56,682 --> 00:26:58,014
I know.

667
00:26:58,083 --> 00:26:59,560
We're not just bankrupt.
We're criminals.

668
00:26:59,584 --> 00:27:00,629
I think we might go to jail.

669
00:27:00,653 --> 00:27:03,053
Oh, we're so incredibly screwed.

670
00:27:03,122 --> 00:27:05,255
Like a two-dollar whore.

671
00:27:06,659 --> 00:27:09,142
Yang, that's my broken ankle.

672
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:10,722
How about a little
heads-up next time

673
00:27:10,746 --> 00:27:12,186
you wanna steal
one of my patients?

674
00:27:14,849 --> 00:27:16,283
What happened to them?

675
00:27:18,287 --> 00:27:20,170
I saved his life.

676
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:24,753
So I get that you saved him,

677
00:27:24,777 --> 00:27:28,122
but he was my patient, and you
should've told me before you...

678
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:29,797
I came up with
the fix. You didn't.

679
00:27:29,865 --> 00:27:33,011
If you're still pissed about
what happened the other night,

680
00:27:33,035 --> 00:27:35,418
I'm with Jackson.

681
00:27:35,488 --> 00:27:37,632
It was inappropriate, and
it's not gonna happen again.

682
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:39,334
What are you talking about?

683
00:27:39,358 --> 00:27:41,758
When you kissed me, Shane.

684
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:43,343
Oh. That.

685
00:27:43,412 --> 00:27:46,746
We were excited. It happened.

686
00:27:46,815 --> 00:27:48,449
I'm sorry it meant
more to you...

687
00:27:48,534 --> 00:27:49,650
It didn't.

688
00:27:49,718 --> 00:27:50,862
You're still talking about it.

689
00:27:50,886 --> 00:27:53,520
What's happened to you?

690
00:27:53,589 --> 00:27:55,756
What are you guys
whispering about?

691
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:56,940
Nothing.

692
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:58,041
God, you guys, fine.

693
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:59,426
It's Arizona Robbins.

694
00:27:59,512 --> 00:28:00,822
But please don't
say anything, okay?

695
00:28:00,846 --> 00:28:02,741
Because she really
doesn't need... Robbins?

696
00:28:02,765 --> 00:28:04,014
So... You're gay now?

697
00:28:04,083 --> 00:28:06,549
Shane, grow up.
It's a sliding scale.

698
00:28:06,618 --> 00:28:08,168
I slid over her way.

699
00:28:08,236 --> 00:28:10,715
If you really have to label
everything, then label me "in love."

700
00:28:10,739 --> 00:28:11,855
Murphy!

701
00:28:13,158 --> 00:28:15,036
<i>Dr. Mahoney to triage.</i>

702
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,893
<i>Dr. Mahoney to triage.</i>

703
00:28:16,962 --> 00:28:19,557
I'm sorry. They pretty
much figured it out.

704
00:28:19,581 --> 00:28:22,899
No. I'm sorry, because
I'm about to be very frank.

705
00:28:22,968 --> 00:28:25,118
The other night was
a bad call on my part.

706
00:28:25,187 --> 00:28:27,387
I was lonely, and it was lovely.

707
00:28:27,456 --> 00:28:30,156
But it was one night, and
that's all that it will ever be,

708
00:28:30,225 --> 00:28:32,626
so if you had different
expectations, please adjust them.

709
00:28:33,412 --> 00:28:35,112
Uh, of course.

710
00:28:35,181 --> 00:28:37,381
There's no need to
apologize. It's my fault.

711
00:28:38,718 --> 00:28:40,595
I don't open up to people much,

712
00:28:40,619 --> 00:28:42,430
and when I try to
open up a little bit,

713
00:28:42,454 --> 00:28:45,472
I can get carried away.
It's happened before.

714
00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:48,725
And you...

715
00:28:48,794 --> 00:28:51,544
I've just always admired
you as a surgeon,

716
00:28:51,613 --> 00:28:53,579
and a person,

717
00:28:53,648 --> 00:28:56,008
and the thought that
you thought about me...

718
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:01,749
I misunderstood. Um, I
went overboard, and I'm sorry.

719
00:29:01,773 --> 00:29:03,473
It won't happen again.

720
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:06,810
Leah...

721
00:29:06,879 --> 00:29:08,111
Thank you for understanding.

722
00:29:16,322 --> 00:29:18,155
Gin, rocks.

723
00:29:18,223 --> 00:29:19,434
You gonna charge me again?

724
00:29:19,458 --> 00:29:22,258
Most places comp
the bands, you know?

725
00:29:22,327 --> 00:29:23,944
I got this one.

726
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:26,012
Appreciate that.

727
00:29:26,081 --> 00:29:27,241
Jimmy Evans.

728
00:29:28,033 --> 00:29:29,166
Hey.

729
00:29:31,203 --> 00:29:32,402
I know you.

730
00:29:35,474 --> 00:29:38,441
I've, uh, been here
the last couple of nights.

731
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:40,493
No. Something else.

732
00:29:45,551 --> 00:29:46,711
Oh, my God.

733
00:29:48,487 --> 00:29:50,320
You're a doctor...

734
00:29:50,389 --> 00:29:52,055
At the hospital.

735
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:53,540
Guilty.

736
00:29:53,626 --> 00:29:55,804
What brings you
back here every night?

737
00:29:55,828 --> 00:29:59,362
Oh, uh, you. I
mean, I like your set.

738
00:29:59,431 --> 00:30:00,809
Uh, I like the
Albert Collins stuff.

739
00:30:00,833 --> 00:30:03,116
Ah. You got a good
ear, then. You play?

740
00:30:03,184 --> 00:30:05,852
My dad taught me a
little when I was a kid,

741
00:30:05,921 --> 00:30:07,821
but, uh, he
didn't stick with it.

742
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:09,618
Aw, you should
have stuck with it.

743
00:30:09,642 --> 00:30:11,002
Look where it
could've taken you.

744
00:30:11,026 --> 00:30:12,954
I mean, instead of
saving people's lives,

745
00:30:12,978 --> 00:30:14,923
you could be playing
70-year-old songs

746
00:30:14,947 --> 00:30:16,858
to four people in
a giant ashtray.

747
00:30:22,888 --> 00:30:25,328
What kind of doctor are you?

748
00:30:25,558 --> 00:30:27,024
Oh. Pediatric surgeon.

749
00:30:27,743 --> 00:30:29,710
Uh, babies, kids.

750
00:30:29,778 --> 00:30:31,979
I met a pediatric surgeon once.

751
00:30:32,047 --> 00:30:34,781
Scariest night of my life.

752
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:36,561
My son's not even two years old.

753
00:30:36,585 --> 00:30:39,453
I'm feeding him strawberries,
and he starts choking.

754
00:30:39,538 --> 00:30:41,704
Turned blue.

755
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:45,042
We take him in, they
get him breathing again.

756
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:47,477
Pediatric surgeon runs
the tube down his throat,

757
00:30:47,546 --> 00:30:49,179
and got the thing out.

758
00:30:49,248 --> 00:30:52,883
Saved my boy's life.
Saved my life, too.

759
00:30:52,951 --> 00:30:55,335
If I'd lost my little
boy that night,

760
00:30:55,403 --> 00:30:59,038
I never would've made it.
I never would've survived.

761
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:03,193
I'm glad it worked out for you.

762
00:31:03,262 --> 00:31:07,063
Yeah. Thank God for
you guys, man. Seriously.

763
00:31:08,917 --> 00:31:10,216
So where is he?

764
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:13,219
Now, I mean.
Where's your family?

765
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:15,288
That's a complicated answer.

766
00:31:18,043 --> 00:31:20,610
This place has
really cleared out.

767
00:31:20,679 --> 00:31:22,679
I guess I was the big draw.

768
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:25,465
Yeah, well...

769
00:31:25,534 --> 00:31:28,085
I probably should
head out myself.

770
00:31:28,153 --> 00:31:29,747
I was gonna say,
you play a little?

771
00:31:29,771 --> 00:31:32,216
I got an extra guitar. We can
get up and make some noise.

772
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,591
No. No, I haven't
played since I was a kid.

773
00:31:34,659 --> 00:31:37,044
Well, there's no one
here to hear you suck.

774
00:31:37,112 --> 00:31:38,352
Come on. It'll be fun.

775
00:31:39,498 --> 00:31:41,098
I don't know any songs.

776
00:31:41,166 --> 00:31:43,294
What about the songs
your daddy taught you?

777
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:46,536
I might know one of those.

778
00:31:49,641 --> 00:31:51,290
Am I hearing
changes in his rhythm?

779
00:31:52,828 --> 00:31:54,260
Turn up the heart
monitor, please.

780
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:56,112
Some suction.

781
00:31:56,181 --> 00:31:57,514
More mannitol.

782
00:31:57,582 --> 00:32:01,050
Rhythm's getting very
erratic, and BP's rising.

783
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,952
Quiet. Quiet.

784
00:32:10,245 --> 00:32:11,545
Damn it.

785
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:13,208
All right. Reverse
the paralytics.

786
00:32:13,232 --> 00:32:15,348
All right, let me
check his gag reflexes.

787
00:32:20,522 --> 00:32:24,123
Oh, no, Mickey. Come on. No.

788
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:27,193
Dr. Shepherd, there's
no brain activity.

789
00:32:42,795 --> 00:32:48,114
That is a pancreatic
pseudocyst! Bam! Ha!

790
00:32:50,085 --> 00:32:51,751
Did you just say "bam"?

791
00:32:51,837 --> 00:32:53,804
It had to be
referred pain, right?

792
00:32:53,872 --> 00:32:55,505
But referred pain
to the shoulder

793
00:32:55,574 --> 00:32:57,151
means irritation
of the diaphragm,

794
00:32:57,175 --> 00:32:59,709
which did not make sense, but...

795
00:32:59,762 --> 00:33:01,561
You have pancreatic
fluid leakage,

796
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:03,130
so I was thinking, well,

797
00:33:03,198 --> 00:33:05,448
maybe something was
aggravating the diaphragm,

798
00:33:05,517 --> 00:33:08,167
which referred to the
shoulder, and bam!

799
00:33:08,237 --> 00:33:11,254
Pancreatic pseudocyst.

800
00:33:11,323 --> 00:33:13,101
Maybe you should wipe that smile

801
00:33:13,125 --> 00:33:15,565
off your face before
you tell the patient.

802
00:33:17,195 --> 00:33:18,845
Oh, God. I am so sorry.

803
00:33:18,914 --> 00:33:20,154
I forgot that this is bad news.

804
00:33:22,034 --> 00:33:23,850
And you're laughing.

805
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:28,621
For the first time today, I
feel like I'm in good hands.

806
00:33:28,707 --> 00:33:30,574
Nice work, Wilson.

807
00:33:30,642 --> 00:33:32,882
You traced it
back to the source.

808
00:33:44,273 --> 00:33:46,618
Hey! I'm doing my
mother's research,

809
00:33:46,642 --> 00:33:49,259
but not for the reasons
you said I should.

810
00:33:49,311 --> 00:33:51,256
Not now, Grey.
She had a good idea!

811
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:54,380
I'm not riding her coattails.
I am sharing her passion.

812
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:56,883
Maybe this is what
my mother gave me.

813
00:33:56,952 --> 00:34:00,219
<i>Your daddy taught
you pretty good.</i>

814
00:34:37,559 --> 00:34:38,887
Hey.

815
00:34:38,911 --> 00:34:40,543
You okay?

816
00:34:42,347 --> 00:34:45,281
You know, that's a good tune.

817
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:47,033
Brings back a lot.

818
00:34:48,303 --> 00:34:49,986
You know, if you're not careful,

819
00:34:50,054 --> 00:34:53,856
all your old mistakes
can just roll up on you.

820
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:55,691
I taught my kid
to play guitar, too.

821
00:34:55,761 --> 00:34:57,810
It's like you said.

822
00:34:59,281 --> 00:35:01,030
I wish I'd have stuck with it.

823
00:35:02,434 --> 00:35:05,935
Well, your kid
probably does, too.

824
00:35:06,004 --> 00:35:08,421
Yeah, but there's no
going back, is there?

825
00:35:11,259 --> 00:35:13,392
Can I show you a picture of him?

826
00:35:13,461 --> 00:35:14,511
My boy?

827
00:35:14,563 --> 00:35:16,529
What, you have one?

828
00:35:27,409 --> 00:35:28,691
That's Nicky.

829
00:35:30,496 --> 00:35:32,812
He's five there. He'd
be about 12 now.

830
00:35:32,881 --> 00:35:35,382
And, uh, that's his mom, Naomi.

831
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:38,184
She's Japanese.

832
00:35:38,253 --> 00:35:39,719
Who's...

833
00:35:39,788 --> 00:35:42,054
Where are they?

834
00:35:42,141 --> 00:35:43,656
South Florida.

835
00:35:43,725 --> 00:35:46,492
I haven't been
back there in years.

836
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:49,045
God, you just keep doing this.

837
00:35:49,097 --> 00:35:51,431
What do you mean?

838
00:35:51,517 --> 00:35:54,200
Do this kid a favor.
Don't ever go back.

839
00:35:54,269 --> 00:35:56,052
Let him grow up

840
00:35:56,104 --> 00:35:57,749
without knowing you any
more that he already has.

841
00:35:57,773 --> 00:36:00,206
What the hell, man?

842
00:36:00,275 --> 00:36:02,675
He's better off. You know that.

843
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:05,562
What's your problem?

844
00:36:07,749 --> 00:36:09,199
We were having fun here.

845
00:36:09,267 --> 00:36:11,179
I'm trying to protect your
kid. You're no good to him.

846
00:36:11,203 --> 00:36:14,387
Hey, you don't know me,
and you don't talk about my kid.

847
00:36:15,924 --> 00:36:17,073
Hey! No!

848
00:36:17,125 --> 00:36:18,758
Out!

849
00:36:18,844 --> 00:36:20,526
You, out, now!

850
00:36:30,455 --> 00:36:32,333
This way, you can do the
most good for the most people.

851
00:36:32,357 --> 00:36:33,456
You think so?

852
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:36,092
Oh, yeah. He would be grateful.

853
00:36:36,161 --> 00:36:38,711
You did exactly what he wanted.

854
00:36:40,848 --> 00:36:43,261
I'm not dropping the project.

855
00:36:43,285 --> 00:36:44,667
You were right.

856
00:36:44,736 --> 00:36:47,803
I was doing it for her.

857
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:52,308
And now I will do it for a million
people I'll never even meet.

858
00:36:52,377 --> 00:36:54,277
And for Mickey.

859
00:36:57,282 --> 00:36:59,602
I could really use your help.

860
00:37:20,388 --> 00:37:22,300
<i>We are just starting to learn</i>

861
00:37:22,324 --> 00:37:24,284
<i>the extent of the
brain's connections.</i>

862
00:37:27,295 --> 00:37:30,664
<i>How far they reach,
how deep they go.</i>

863
00:37:30,732 --> 00:37:32,449
I think I've ceased to exist.

864
00:37:33,768 --> 00:37:35,885
I made history today, literally.

865
00:37:35,954 --> 00:37:40,490
Operated on the inoperable,
saved a man from certain death,

866
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:43,759
and then ruined his life.

867
00:37:43,828 --> 00:37:49,082
Oh, also Owen seems very
happy with that Marling person

868
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:52,685
to whom he has never
even mentioned me.

869
00:37:52,754 --> 00:37:57,156
It's as if the last few
years never happened.

870
00:37:59,561 --> 00:38:02,762
Also, the automatic paper towel
thingy won't recognize me as human.

871
00:38:02,830 --> 00:38:05,248
I'm just standing there,
waving my hands like an idiot.

872
00:38:05,317 --> 00:38:07,033
I'm sorry. What?

873
00:38:10,222 --> 00:38:11,404
What are you doing?

874
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:13,601
Application for
research funding.

875
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:14,768
Oh, you picked your project.

876
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:15,853
Uh, yeah.

877
00:38:15,877 --> 00:38:18,117
I'm gonna 3-D
print portal veins.

878
00:38:19,081 --> 00:38:21,081
That is amazing, Mer.

879
00:38:21,166 --> 00:38:22,777
How are you gonna
do that... Okay, don't.

880
00:38:22,801 --> 00:38:24,862
It's why I didn't tell you.

881
00:38:24,886 --> 00:38:28,220
I have a career and a family,
and I'm going to do both.

882
00:38:28,289 --> 00:38:30,652
What I don't have time for is
for you to tell me that I can't.

883
00:38:30,676 --> 00:38:31,841
I never said that.

884
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:33,288
You know, I was
always there for you,

885
00:38:33,312 --> 00:38:35,077
for whatever you needed,

886
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:38,114
and now this is when I need you,

887
00:38:38,183 --> 00:38:40,211
and you're supposed to help me.

888
00:38:40,235 --> 00:38:42,530
And instead, last week
you pushed me aside

889
00:38:42,554 --> 00:38:44,353
because I had a baby.

890
00:38:44,406 --> 00:38:46,751
You don't have time for me now?

891
00:38:46,775 --> 00:38:48,074
Because you don't have time

892
00:38:48,143 --> 00:38:51,844
for people who want
things that you don't want.

893
00:38:51,913 --> 00:38:56,399
<i>But we know that every
connection matters.</i>

894
00:38:56,451 --> 00:38:57,850
<i>Every connection is crucial.</i>

895
00:38:59,921 --> 00:39:02,455
I have to finish this.

896
00:39:04,943 --> 00:39:06,743
<i>And when one is broken,</i>

897
00:39:09,548 --> 00:39:11,915
<i>it usually means some
damage has been done.</i>

898
00:39:11,983 --> 00:39:14,845
I can't figure it out if
you're seeing someone else

899
00:39:14,869 --> 00:39:16,347
or you think that
you knocked me up,

900
00:39:16,371 --> 00:39:19,672
so I tried to trace it back

901
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:21,618
to the root of the problem,
and I think it's your dad.

902
00:39:21,642 --> 00:39:22,759
Look, I told you...

903
00:39:22,811 --> 00:39:24,155
Not to bring it
up again, I know,

904
00:39:24,179 --> 00:39:26,374
and this is the last time,
because if I'm wrong...

905
00:39:26,398 --> 00:39:29,065
You're not wrong. You
should be proud of yourself.

906
00:39:29,117 --> 00:39:30,628
I could've let him
just pass through,

907
00:39:30,652 --> 00:39:32,051
but you were all, "Talk to him.

908
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,970
"You'll wonder for
the rest of your life."

909
00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:36,267
Well, thanks. I didn't know I
could feel this crappy again

910
00:39:36,291 --> 00:39:38,391
after 18 frickin' years!

911
00:39:44,065 --> 00:39:46,110
<i>This system of connections
compels us to act</i>

912
00:39:46,134 --> 00:39:48,651
<i>and choose and behave...</i>

913
00:39:53,525 --> 00:39:55,975
<i>Sometimes seemingly
against our own will.</i>

914
00:40:15,346 --> 00:40:18,347
<i>But it is not random at all.</i>

915
00:40:18,417 --> 00:40:21,083
<i>It is the map of who we are.</i>

916
00:40:22,687 --> 00:40:25,138
Did you get my text? Shh.

917
00:40:25,207 --> 00:40:26,917
Sorry. I was stuck there.

918
00:40:26,941 --> 00:40:28,436
I had to get this
thing out by tonight.

919
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:29,604
I got hung up, too.

920
00:40:29,628 --> 00:40:31,227
I just barely got them down.

921
00:40:31,295 --> 00:40:32,339
Just now? I know.

922
00:40:32,363 --> 00:40:33,441
It's so late.

923
00:40:33,465 --> 00:40:35,148
I know. I tried.

924
00:40:37,819 --> 00:40:38,951
It's not working.

925
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:40,903
No, it isn't.

926
00:40:43,007 --> 00:40:44,841
We just can't seem
to make the pieces fit.

927
00:40:44,893 --> 00:40:47,210
I agree, but I don't know how...

928
00:40:47,279 --> 00:40:48,444
I think I do.

929
00:40:48,513 --> 00:40:52,031
I wanna spend more
time on this BCI research.

930
00:40:52,117 --> 00:40:55,501
Torres and I blew
it wide open today.

931
00:40:55,570 --> 00:40:57,636
So you wanna take on more? No.

932
00:40:57,706 --> 00:41:00,523
Less, actually.

933
00:41:00,575 --> 00:41:04,060
This is a big year for you, and
you need time to make it work.

934
00:41:04,129 --> 00:41:07,179
I had a big year.
I can step back,

935
00:41:07,249 --> 00:41:09,093
scale down my surgeries,
focus on this research,

936
00:41:09,117 --> 00:41:10,550
spend time with the kids,

937
00:41:10,619 --> 00:41:16,055
and give you the slack you
need to make this year count.

938
00:41:17,108 --> 00:41:18,340
I don't like it.

939
00:41:18,393 --> 00:41:20,026
You'll resent me,

940
00:41:20,094 --> 00:41:23,346
and so will the kids, and I
don't wanna be my mother.

941
00:41:23,398 --> 00:41:25,698
You're not your mother.

942
00:41:25,767 --> 00:41:27,099
You know that.

943
00:41:27,185 --> 00:41:29,719
<i>We will work to
understand ourselves,</i>

944
00:41:31,323 --> 00:41:32,488
<i>solve the puzzle.</i>

945
00:41:32,557 --> 00:41:33,889
It feels unfair.

946
00:41:33,958 --> 00:41:36,659
Spending time with the
kids is not a consolation prize.

947
00:41:36,728 --> 00:41:38,260
It is the prize.

948
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:40,062
You want fair?
Maybe down the road,

949
00:41:40,131 --> 00:41:41,797
I'll give you a year with them.

950
00:41:41,866 --> 00:41:43,599
Maybe when Zola's dating,

951
00:41:43,668 --> 00:41:46,068
'cause I don't wanna
be around for that.

952
00:41:50,375 --> 00:41:52,052
I love you. Well, you should.

953
00:41:52,076 --> 00:41:53,476
What I'm doing
is amazing for you.

954
00:41:54,445 --> 00:41:55,761
Mmm!

955
00:41:59,467 --> 00:42:01,412
You're gonna have
more fun than me.

956
00:42:01,436 --> 00:42:03,753
I know. Oh, so that's
where that went.

957
00:42:03,805 --> 00:42:05,788
Yeah. Is that ours?

958
00:42:05,857 --> 00:42:06,989
Yes.

959
00:42:07,058 --> 00:42:09,925
<i>How all the connections work</i>

960
00:42:11,179 --> 00:42:13,145
<i>and all the pieces...</i>

961
00:42:14,315 --> 00:42:15,514
<i>fit.</i>
