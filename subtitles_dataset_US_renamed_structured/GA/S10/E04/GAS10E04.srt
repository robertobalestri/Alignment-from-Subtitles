1
00:00:05,206 --> 00:00:06,926
<i>As anyone who's ever had</i>

2
00:00:06,973 --> 00:00:10,742
<i>their tonsils out can tell
you, surgery isn't cheap.</i>

3
00:00:10,811 --> 00:00:14,079
<i>It takes a lot of money to
keep a hospital's doors open.</i>

4
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:17,782
<i>And when the funds run out,</i>

5
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:20,385
<i>it's on us to get out there
and raise some more.</i>

6
00:00:21,822 --> 00:00:23,321
<i>Which means</i>

7
00:00:25,342 --> 00:00:27,843
<i>it's time to put on makeup.</i>

8
00:00:27,912 --> 00:00:31,329
<i>It's time to dress up right.</i>

9
00:00:31,398 --> 00:00:34,399
<i>It's time to get things started
on</i> The Muppet Show...

10
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:36,467
<i>Crap! Sorry.</i>

11
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:41,056
<i>I've been watching a lot of
children's television lately.</i>

12
00:00:41,125 --> 00:00:42,574
Are we ready to go?

13
00:00:42,642 --> 00:00:43,825
<i>But you get the idea.</i>

14
00:00:43,894 --> 00:00:46,894
Uh, almost. Someone doesn't
want to put her shoes on.

15
00:00:48,582 --> 00:00:50,176
Can I just get a word?

16
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,469
Hey. Hey. I, uh, really
hope this red carpet

17
00:00:53,537 --> 00:00:55,415
is something you had laying
around the house, Avery.

18
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:57,517
We're trying to raise
money tonight, not waste it.

19
00:00:57,541 --> 00:00:59,508
I grew up in this world.
I know how it works.

20
00:00:59,577 --> 00:01:01,555
We're attracting serious
people with serious money

21
00:01:01,579 --> 00:01:03,122
and tailoring an event to them.

22
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:05,747
Tonight is gonna be tasteful,
sophisticated, conservative.

23
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:07,056
Come in.

24
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:24,649
You and I have very different
definitions of the word "conservative."

25
00:01:24,718 --> 00:01:26,438
Cheers!

26
00:01:32,059 --> 00:01:35,260
Ari, what did you
spend my money on?

27
00:01:35,329 --> 00:01:38,514
This is what you want.
You want spectacle, pizzazz.

28
00:01:38,582 --> 00:01:41,666
Do I look like someone
who wants pizzazz?

29
00:01:41,735 --> 00:01:43,163
When people think of hospitals,

30
00:01:43,187 --> 00:01:46,304
they think of death,
disease, old people.

31
00:01:46,373 --> 00:01:49,185
Not sexy. We are
giving them Las Vegas.

32
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:50,776
We are giving them a show.

33
00:01:50,844 --> 00:01:52,471
People are more inclined
to open their wallets

34
00:01:52,495 --> 00:01:55,180
if they're having fun. Boop.

35
00:01:59,469 --> 00:02:00,902
He's falling apart.

36
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:03,237
He's refused to use
incentive spirometry.

37
00:02:03,306 --> 00:02:06,269
Look, and his right lung is
just about ready to collapse.

38
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:08,271
If he wants to suffer,
then maybe we let him.

39
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:09,522
Oh, so you're gonna let him die

40
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:10,812
because he hurt your feelings?

41
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,258
There isn't anything
that he can say to me

42
00:02:12,282 --> 00:02:14,594
that I haven't heard from
my mother 1,000 times.

43
00:02:14,618 --> 00:02:16,201
I'm bulletproof.

44
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:18,348
But we can force all the
treatment on him we want.

45
00:02:18,372 --> 00:02:20,667
It won't make a
difference if he decides

46
00:02:20,691 --> 00:02:22,936
he does not wanna
fight for himself.

47
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,522
Maybe he just needs
to see what it feels like

48
00:02:25,546 --> 00:02:27,562
to hit bottom.

49
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,334
Dr. Bailey?

50
00:02:32,403 --> 00:02:35,453
Radiology wants to see you regarding
Gene Steers' PET scan results.

51
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:39,524
Um, call respiratory, and get
Dr. Webber started on CPAP.

52
00:02:39,593 --> 00:02:41,004
Oh, he is not
going to like that.

53
00:02:41,028 --> 00:02:42,289
He doesn't have to like it.

54
00:02:42,313 --> 00:02:44,329
He just has to do it.

55
00:02:44,398 --> 00:02:46,209
Trade assignments with me. No.

56
00:02:46,233 --> 00:02:47,944
You're in a bad mood
because your crappy boyfriend

57
00:02:47,968 --> 00:02:49,379
didn't invite you to the gala.

58
00:02:49,403 --> 00:02:50,580
But you know what's
gonna make you feel better?

59
00:02:50,604 --> 00:02:52,215
Spending a night
on the peds floor

60
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:53,783
with all of the
delightful little children.

61
00:02:53,807 --> 00:02:57,008
Or, I could just punch my
crappy boyfriend in the junk.

62
00:02:57,077 --> 00:02:59,143
Why not both?

63
00:02:59,212 --> 00:03:00,412
Shane, trade with me.

64
00:03:00,447 --> 00:03:01,674
I'm a surgeon, not a babysitter.

65
00:03:01,698 --> 00:03:03,243
Me either. Why do I get screwed?

66
00:03:03,267 --> 00:03:04,599
Cruel twist of fate?

67
00:03:04,668 --> 00:03:06,001
Hey! Ross, Edwards.

68
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:07,847
It's just the two of
you down here tonight,

69
00:03:07,871 --> 00:03:10,650
so if you find yourselves in
over your head, call a grown-up.

70
00:03:10,674 --> 00:03:14,009
Kepner, kid in bed eight has
abdominal pain and vomiting.

71
00:03:14,078 --> 00:03:16,544
If CT's negative, give him
fluids and send him home.

72
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:17,946
Don't we look spiffy.

73
00:03:18,015 --> 00:03:19,281
Yeah, I do.

74
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:21,850
You look like crap.

75
00:03:21,918 --> 00:03:24,286
I haven't had a chance
to freshen up yet, you ass.

76
00:03:24,355 --> 00:03:25,398
Watch your back, coming through!

77
00:03:25,422 --> 00:03:26,516
Holy heck.

78
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,556
Hey, what's the story?

79
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:32,460
Once upon a time, three idiots got
wasted and ran their car into a tree.

80
00:03:32,529 --> 00:03:34,524
They're drunk?
No, high as kites.

81
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:36,448
Lucky they were the
only ones that got hurt.

82
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:39,768
Hey, Sinatra, I'll give you
a fiver for a glass of wine.

83
00:03:39,837 --> 00:03:41,319
Sir, what did you take?

84
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:44,322
It's heroin. Add a tox
screen to their trauma labs.

85
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:46,471
What's your name?
No ID on any of 'em.

86
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:48,559
We've been going with
John, Jerry, and Jake Doe.

87
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:50,106
Cute. APRIL: Okay, let's hustle.

88
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:51,440
Get a full trauma workup
so I can get upstairs

89
00:03:51,464 --> 00:03:53,904
and run a brush through my hair.

90
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:06,628
Oh!

91
00:04:06,697 --> 00:04:10,983
Meredith Grey, as I live and
breathe. I haven't seen you in ages.

92
00:04:11,035 --> 00:04:12,751
How's, uh, Derek
liking maternity leave?

93
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:14,302
He's on paternity leave.

94
00:04:14,371 --> 00:04:16,371
Yeah, okay. We have a deal.

95
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:18,034
I don't work. Neither does he.

96
00:04:18,058 --> 00:04:19,457
It's working out well.

97
00:04:19,526 --> 00:04:21,471
I live in your house. You're
bored out of your minds.

98
00:04:21,495 --> 00:04:23,272
Yeah, they've got all this
pent-up surgical energy

99
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:24,807
and now everything's
a competition.

100
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:26,375
It is not. And he's winning.

101
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:28,011
Oh. He is not winning.

102
00:04:28,035 --> 00:04:29,379
He couldn't even get Zola
to put her shoes on tonight.

103
00:04:29,403 --> 00:04:31,447
I did that. I got her
to put her shoes on.

104
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:33,421
So I'm winning.

105
00:04:35,092 --> 00:04:36,332
I need to come back to work.

106
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:38,104
Drink?

107
00:04:38,128 --> 00:04:39,305
Ooh. Excuse me.

108
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:42,614
That's the creepiest
waiter I've ever seen.

109
00:04:42,683 --> 00:04:45,800
Bailey's gonna lose her
mind. She can't stand clowns.

110
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:47,897
This is gonna be hilarious.
Bailey's not coming.

111
00:04:47,921 --> 00:04:50,038
What? Wait, we can do that?

112
00:04:50,106 --> 00:04:51,851
Okay, I have been
dreading having to

113
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,553
be in the same
room with Arizona.

114
00:04:53,577 --> 00:04:55,305
If this isn't mandatory,
I'm going home.

115
00:04:55,329 --> 00:04:57,474
Wait, nobody's going home.
I'm giving 10% of tonight's take

116
00:04:57,498 --> 00:04:59,408
to the department that
raises the most money.

117
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:01,265
Spread the word.

118
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:02,417
Wow.

119
00:05:02,485 --> 00:05:05,253
Derek is really good
at this kind of thing.

120
00:05:05,322 --> 00:05:06,882
I should get started
before he does.

121
00:05:06,906 --> 00:05:09,266
Oh, I think he already has.
- Amazing.

122
00:05:09,592 --> 00:05:10,625
Oh, come on.

123
00:05:28,228 --> 00:05:30,795
I have to confess something.
I know who you are.

124
00:05:30,864 --> 00:05:33,431
I saw your video from the
TED Conference and I just...

125
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,800
I'm sorry. I'm a
little starstruck.

126
00:05:35,869 --> 00:05:37,586
Really?

127
00:05:37,654 --> 00:05:39,955
Yeah. You know, I go every year,

128
00:05:40,023 --> 00:05:42,323
and so many of the talks
often focus on the tech

129
00:05:42,392 --> 00:05:46,478
or something
clever, but yours...

130
00:05:46,547 --> 00:05:48,697
You spoke from the heart.
You might be surprised...

131
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:02,360
The truth. You're
an inspiration.

132
00:06:02,429 --> 00:06:04,996
If I lost my wife
in a plane crash...

133
00:06:05,065 --> 00:06:06,731
Oh, I'm sorry. What?

134
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:09,501
Your wife. She
passed away, right?

135
00:06:14,408 --> 00:06:16,841
Yes, she did.

136
00:06:19,513 --> 00:06:20,740
It's been really hard.

137
00:06:20,764 --> 00:06:22,964
Cristina.

138
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:24,449
You and I have to join forces

139
00:06:24,518 --> 00:06:27,652
so that Derek does
not win Avery's money.

140
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,220
Prison's changed you.

141
00:06:30,741 --> 00:06:32,340
We are in trouble.

142
00:06:32,409 --> 00:06:34,353
Avery bet the
farm on this party.

143
00:06:34,377 --> 00:06:36,377
Listen to you two.

144
00:06:36,446 --> 00:06:38,780
This is not that difficult.
Just be charming.

145
00:06:38,849 --> 00:06:40,260
Use the same skills you would

146
00:06:40,284 --> 00:06:41,694
if you were picking
someone up at a bar.

147
00:06:41,718 --> 00:06:43,796
I know you know how to do that.

148
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,082
And you need to practice.

149
00:06:46,106 --> 00:06:48,146
If we're gonna get serious
about meeting new people.

150
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:51,370
You need to let that go.
Ooh, Richie Rich, 10:00.

151
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:56,448
Mr. Steers, I know
this is hard to hear,

152
00:06:56,517 --> 00:07:00,184
but the PET scan showed
your cancer has spread.

153
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:03,621
I'm afraid surgery is
no longer an option.

154
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:05,918
I'll tell you what's hard.

155
00:07:05,942 --> 00:07:07,842
This pillow.

156
00:07:07,911 --> 00:07:09,589
Why don't you have that Oriental
nurse bring me a new one?

157
00:07:09,613 --> 00:07:11,779
Gene, we've talked about this.

158
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:14,098
Victoria is from
the Philippines.

159
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:16,100
That's what I
said. No, it isn't!

160
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:18,235
Okay, fine.

161
00:07:18,304 --> 00:07:20,550
So no surgery. What's that mean?

162
00:07:20,574 --> 00:07:22,723
More chemo?
What's the next step?

163
00:07:22,792 --> 00:07:25,193
We talked about
worst-case scenarios

164
00:07:25,262 --> 00:07:29,797
before the PET
scan, and this is it.

165
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:36,237
Um, these are brochures
from several local facilities

166
00:07:36,305 --> 00:07:40,625
that can help ease
you into the final stages.

167
00:07:40,694 --> 00:07:44,329
When you're ready, we can talk
about which might be the best fit.

168
00:07:44,398 --> 00:07:47,060
Best fit is gonna be the
one with topless nurses.

169
00:07:47,084 --> 00:07:48,483
Mmm.

170
00:07:48,552 --> 00:07:51,519
I don't need any of
that fully nude business.

171
00:07:51,588 --> 00:07:53,833
They don't serve
booze at the joints

172
00:07:53,857 --> 00:07:56,274
where the girls
ditch their skivvies.

173
00:07:56,343 --> 00:08:00,511
Matter of fact, how
about I slip you a tenner,

174
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,814
you slip me a
bottle of something?

175
00:08:02,883 --> 00:08:04,098
I'll be available

176
00:08:04,184 --> 00:08:06,534
when you're ready to
talk about your options.

177
00:08:06,603 --> 00:08:09,404
I'll call if I start
to feel weepy.

178
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:19,030
What are you doing?

179
00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:20,882
Eating shrimp at a party.

180
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:23,146
I just spent 20 minutes
talking to donors about you

181
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,810
when they'd prefer
to be talking to you.

182
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:26,421
You need to... Alex!

183
00:08:26,489 --> 00:08:27,889
You even listening to me?

184
00:08:27,957 --> 00:08:29,357
I gotta get some air.

185
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:30,508
Alex!

186
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:36,875
Where the hell are you going?

187
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:37,999
Hey, Jackson!

188
00:08:38,067 --> 00:08:39,334
Champagne?

189
00:08:39,402 --> 00:08:40,668
Oh!

190
00:08:40,754 --> 00:08:42,320
This is amazing!

191
00:08:42,388 --> 00:08:44,455
Oh, the magician,

192
00:08:44,507 --> 00:08:46,001
incredible! This is warm.

193
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,537
Oh, yeah, Big Bird
said there's no ice.

194
00:08:47,561 --> 00:08:48,737
Apparently, a miscommunication

195
00:08:48,761 --> 00:08:50,728
between the caterer
and the venue.

196
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:54,293
Cooling blankets. We have
some back at the hospital.

197
00:08:54,317 --> 00:08:55,394
They can bring a
patient's temperature

198
00:08:55,418 --> 00:08:56,629
down in minutes, right?

199
00:08:56,653 --> 00:08:57,714
No reason those
can't chill a bottle.

200
00:08:57,738 --> 00:08:59,037
That's ridiculous.

201
00:08:59,106 --> 00:09:00,933
Then it's on
theme for the night.

202
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:02,891
And I can't leave.

203
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,460
Um, could you please
run back and grab 'em?

204
00:09:06,529 --> 00:09:09,380
What? No, but, uh,
the magician is the...

205
00:09:09,449 --> 00:09:11,048
Please?

206
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:14,702
Fine. GUESTS: Ooh!

207
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:20,541
And that is not even close to
the strangest thing I've seen.

208
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:24,012
Though, honestly, that
story I don't think is, uh,

209
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,258
appropriate.

210
00:09:25,282 --> 00:09:26,942
Well, I'll tell you what, chief.

211
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:29,767
I'm gonna take a
walk over to that table,

212
00:09:29,836 --> 00:09:32,203
and I'm gonna stick a little
something in that cash box.

213
00:09:32,272 --> 00:09:33,921
Now when I come back,

214
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,991
maybe you'll be a little less
reluctant to give up the goods, Owen.

215
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:41,426
Well, now I want
to hear that story.

216
00:09:43,116 --> 00:09:44,893
Emma Marling. Owen Hunt.

217
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,985
Oh, chief of surgery.

218
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:51,623
Well, I guess Grey Sloan is
pulling out its A game tonight.

219
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:53,571
I wasn't sure when I
got a load of the clowns.

220
00:09:53,627 --> 00:09:54,720
Oh, come on. Clowns are great.

221
00:09:54,744 --> 00:09:55,984
People love clowns.

222
00:09:59,883 --> 00:10:02,116
You worried me
there for a second.

223
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:04,825
I was afraid you and I weren't
gonna have anything to talk about.

224
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:08,050
Um...

225
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:12,760
Hey, um, buy you a drink?

226
00:10:12,829 --> 00:10:14,162
Isn't it an open bar?

227
00:10:14,231 --> 00:10:15,497
The price is right.

228
00:10:15,565 --> 00:10:16,915
Oh.

229
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:18,623
Okay. Thanks.

230
00:10:20,636 --> 00:10:23,187
What was that? What was what?

231
00:10:23,256 --> 00:10:24,872
That whole sparkly eye thing.

232
00:10:24,941 --> 00:10:28,037
Well, I can't help it if my
eyes have a natural sparkle.

233
00:10:28,061 --> 00:10:31,295
You were flirting. I don't
know what you're talking about.

234
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:33,381
Go juggle some balls.

235
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,190
You just brought a
knife to a gun fight.

236
00:10:42,592 --> 00:10:44,512
Arizona? Uh...

237
00:10:44,544 --> 00:10:46,828
Hey, um, it turns
out we needed more

238
00:10:46,897 --> 00:10:50,698
IV kits up in peds, but I
can't seem to find them.

239
00:10:50,767 --> 00:10:53,334
Do you need a hand?
No, no. Um, I'll be fine.

240
00:10:55,656 --> 00:10:57,222
Okay. Just gonna

241
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:58,522
grab these.

242
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:00,265
Cool.

243
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:14,300
Jake's febrile and he's got
a crazy-high white count.

244
00:11:14,324 --> 00:11:17,253
You factor in the heroin, and we're
probably looking at endocarditis.

245
00:11:17,277 --> 00:11:18,754
And I think he's got
a pericardial effusion.

246
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:20,306
So, he could tamponade
at the drop of a hat.

247
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:22,207
And there's another
multiple trauma on its way in.

248
00:11:22,231 --> 00:11:23,876
This is like medical
<i>Whac-A-Mole.</i> I love it.

249
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,244
Kepner said we
should call someone

250
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:26,778
if we're in over our heads.

251
00:11:26,802 --> 00:11:28,302
Oh, good. Dr. Karev.

252
00:11:28,371 --> 00:11:29,848
Hey, I just wanted to follow up

253
00:11:29,872 --> 00:11:31,189
on the abdominal pain kid.

254
00:11:31,257 --> 00:11:33,235
CT was negative, so we
gave him a couple fluid boluses

255
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:34,342
and sent him home.

256
00:11:34,411 --> 00:11:36,477
Great, uh, what
about those guys?

257
00:11:36,546 --> 00:11:39,831
Uh, they're pretty banged
up, but nothing we can't handle.

258
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:42,066
Great. Good. Uh, keep it up.

259
00:11:44,354 --> 00:11:45,653
Nothing we can't handle?

260
00:11:45,722 --> 00:11:47,132
We've been preparing
for this all year.

261
00:11:47,156 --> 00:11:49,335
They have their party
tonight. This is ours. Enjoy it.

262
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,321
Oh, he's bleeding
from his chest tube.

263
00:11:52,345 --> 00:11:53,973
Did you check his coags?
They're still pending.

264
00:11:53,997 --> 00:11:55,930
Uh, get me a petroleum
dressing and some gauze!

265
00:11:55,999 --> 00:11:57,565
And call X-ray to get here stat!

266
00:11:57,634 --> 00:11:59,667
Doctors! Incoming!

267
00:11:59,735 --> 00:12:00,975
You want to call someone,

268
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,732
or do you wanna be a rock star?

269
00:12:04,591 --> 00:12:06,352
Somebody call the blood
bank, make sure they've got

270
00:12:06,376 --> 00:12:07,509
plenty of O-neg on deck.

271
00:12:07,577 --> 00:12:09,677
I want those trauma
rooms ready for action.

272
00:12:09,746 --> 00:12:12,096
Anyone who can be
moved, move them!

273
00:12:12,164 --> 00:12:15,444
We need all the
empty beds we can get!

274
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:18,352
Hey! You heard
her. Lock and load!

275
00:12:18,421 --> 00:12:19,987
Okay, let's move!

276
00:12:25,645 --> 00:12:27,995
Ooh!

277
00:12:28,064 --> 00:12:31,132
I know, look. Isn't
that something?

278
00:12:33,269 --> 00:12:36,320
You pulled a sleeping baby out
of day care to do your dirty work?

279
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:37,755
You're disgusting.

280
00:12:37,824 --> 00:12:39,368
He's got his mother's sparkle.

281
00:12:39,392 --> 00:12:40,502
Hello, baby.

282
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:42,426
Oh, and he's hungry.

283
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:44,061
Convenient.

284
00:12:45,048 --> 00:12:46,481
He's my guy.

285
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:50,050
I'm gonna kill you dead. Mmm.

286
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:54,371
Oh, you're under a
lot of pressure at work.

287
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,652
Lots of late nights
and weekends.

288
00:12:56,676 --> 00:13:00,428
But still, you stay active.
Lots of, uh, physical activity?

289
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:02,124
You can tell all
that from my pulse?

290
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:04,983
Sure, and the way the tux fits.

291
00:13:05,051 --> 00:13:08,302
Oh, my, this watch is gorgeous.

292
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:10,666
It's vintage. It was my
father's, actually. Hmm.

293
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:13,290
He, uh, would wager
watches. Mmm-hmm.

294
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:15,404
And so he won this one. You
know, you need another one.

295
00:13:15,428 --> 00:13:16,627
I'll be right back.

296
00:13:17,414 --> 00:13:19,680
Ooh!

297
00:13:19,749 --> 00:13:22,283
There is a gal over there
doing close-up magic.

298
00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:23,584
You have to see it.

299
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:25,553
Uh...

300
00:13:25,622 --> 00:13:29,541
Emma Marling, this is Dr. Cristina
Yang, our best cardio fellow.

301
00:13:29,609 --> 00:13:30,649
How's it hanging?

302
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:35,533
Go on. You're missing the magic.

303
00:13:39,802 --> 00:13:41,446
- Whiskey soda.
- Coming right up.

304
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:43,482
You are barking up the
wrong tree with that one.

305
00:13:43,506 --> 00:13:45,168
You're never gonna
get a donation out of her.

306
00:13:45,192 --> 00:13:46,919
Those shoes, outlet
mall all the way.

307
00:13:46,943 --> 00:13:47,958
You want

308
00:13:49,879 --> 00:13:51,044
that.

309
00:13:51,113 --> 00:13:52,613
That old lady?

310
00:13:52,682 --> 00:13:54,232
That old lady in Chanel.

311
00:13:54,301 --> 00:13:55,812
Here you go. Thank you.

312
00:13:55,836 --> 00:13:57,251
Go get 'em, tiger.

313
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:09,997
It was a beautiful
service, but after,

314
00:14:10,066 --> 00:14:12,250
little Sofia just kept asking,

315
00:14:12,319 --> 00:14:15,003
"Why is Mommy not
coming home with us?"

316
00:14:15,071 --> 00:14:16,504
You are so strong.

317
00:14:16,573 --> 00:14:20,141
No, it's... Really it's my
work that's kept me strong.

318
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:24,879
This hospital, you
know, these people.

319
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:26,280
That's beautiful.

320
00:14:26,349 --> 00:14:27,593
Where can I make my donation?

321
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:29,161
Right over there
next to the stairs.

322
00:14:29,185 --> 00:14:31,485
Ooh!

323
00:14:31,554 --> 00:14:34,405
The nights are the
hardest, though.

324
00:14:34,474 --> 00:14:36,857
I know exactly what you mean.

325
00:14:36,926 --> 00:14:41,295
Ever since Harvey died, I
can't fall asleep in our bed.

326
00:14:41,364 --> 00:14:45,199
I spend all of my nights
on the couch with the cat.

327
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:46,668
Exactly.

328
00:14:48,404 --> 00:14:50,538
Wait, what?

329
00:14:50,607 --> 00:14:52,072
What is the matter with you?

330
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:54,353
I know this is a difficult time,

331
00:14:54,377 --> 00:14:56,761
but you cannot talk
to my nurses that way.

332
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:58,574
Your move. What?

333
00:14:58,598 --> 00:15:01,315
I figured out your problem.
Your mind is all closed off.

334
00:15:01,384 --> 00:15:03,184
Oh, oh, my mind is closed?

335
00:15:03,252 --> 00:15:05,953
We need to get it fired
up so you can figure out

336
00:15:06,022 --> 00:15:08,339
how you're gonna get
this cancer out of me.

337
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:13,394
Here, I figured you'd want to
play black, 'cause, well, you know.

338
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:20,517
If there was anything I
thought we could try...

339
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:22,770
There is. Make a move.

340
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:24,271
Yeah, I have other patients.

341
00:15:24,341 --> 00:15:26,569
I can't just stand here and...
What would Rosa Parks say?

342
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:28,370
Excuse me? Or
Martin Luther King?

343
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:30,194
You think they would
just stand over there

344
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:32,196
and make excuses like you are?

345
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:34,882
You people are supposed
to be tougher than this.

346
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:38,130
Yeah, oh, I believe that you and I
have reached the end of our ability

347
00:15:38,154 --> 00:15:39,904
to work together.

348
00:15:39,973 --> 00:15:41,372
I'll have a counselor come by

349
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:42,884
and talk to you
about the brochures.

350
00:15:42,908 --> 00:15:44,425
Oh, I see.

351
00:15:44,493 --> 00:15:47,228
You're giving up on me because
you don't like the way I talk.

352
00:15:47,296 --> 00:15:49,814
You're just gonna let me
die 'cause I offend you.

353
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:53,568
I am trying to give you
the best care I possibly can

354
00:15:53,636 --> 00:15:55,848
despite the fact
that you offend me.

355
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:57,638
You are rude and demeaning,

356
00:15:57,707 --> 00:16:00,891
and I am still trying
to help you move on

357
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,921
in the most comfortable
way possible.

358
00:16:02,945 --> 00:16:05,312
I am not going to move on.

359
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:09,249
I'm not gonna pass away or go to
heaven or make a journey home.

360
00:16:09,318 --> 00:16:11,702
I am going to die.

361
00:16:11,771 --> 00:16:13,638
My lungs are gonna deflate.

362
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:15,606
I'm gonna lose
control of my bowels.

363
00:16:15,675 --> 00:16:17,842
My tongue's gonna roll
to the back of my head.

364
00:16:17,911 --> 00:16:19,660
I am going to be dead.

365
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:21,695
There's no making it
sound nice or pretty.

366
00:16:21,765 --> 00:16:25,266
It is not good. I am
going to cease to exist.

367
00:16:25,334 --> 00:16:27,534
And I don't want
to. I am not ready.

368
00:16:27,604 --> 00:16:31,405
So get off your ass
and do something!

369
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,039
What the hell are you doing?

370
00:16:37,063 --> 00:16:38,173
He needs a pericardiocentesis.

371
00:16:38,197 --> 00:16:39,547
Yeah, we can't just do that.

372
00:16:39,615 --> 00:16:41,293
I thought you wanted to be
a rock star. That was before

373
00:16:41,317 --> 00:16:42,628
you started talking about
shoving needles into hearts.

374
00:16:42,652 --> 00:16:44,501
Stop! I'm calling
someone. Not yet.

375
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:46,570
Shane! Not yet.

376
00:16:52,278 --> 00:16:54,523
This is really
very sweet of you.

377
00:16:54,547 --> 00:16:57,715
But, you know, you don't
have to sit here with me.

378
00:16:58,885 --> 00:17:00,785
I don't mind.

379
00:17:04,557 --> 00:17:06,736
I just...

380
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:10,644
I can't stand the way she looks at
me, the way that everyone looks at me.

381
00:17:10,713 --> 00:17:13,514
Uh, no one's looking
at you. Please.

382
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:15,416
I grew up gay.

383
00:17:15,485 --> 00:17:18,302
I know what it feels like
when people are staring.

384
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:21,505
You're missing a
leg, and they stare.

385
00:17:21,574 --> 00:17:24,894
And everyone knows you're
a cheater, and they stare.

386
00:17:24,944 --> 00:17:29,263
And they talk, and they
judge, and they stare.

387
00:17:35,188 --> 00:17:36,308
Like that.

388
00:17:36,372 --> 00:17:37,437
What?

389
00:17:37,506 --> 00:17:38,572
Come on now,

390
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:39,885
you were telling
a story. I know...

391
00:17:39,909 --> 00:17:42,643
I know how you
must feel about me.

392
00:17:42,712 --> 00:17:46,192
And I know you try and hide
it, but I can see it on your face.

393
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,033
What do you think you see?

394
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:51,342
You know,

395
00:17:52,322 --> 00:17:53,471
Jesus.

396
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:56,039
Oh, come on.

397
00:17:56,109 --> 00:18:00,311
Oh, what, I'm
incapable of empathy

398
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:03,814
because I go to church?
What is that about?

399
00:18:03,882 --> 00:18:05,649
I can empathize like
nobody's business,

400
00:18:05,718 --> 00:18:06,834
especially with a cheater.

401
00:18:08,521 --> 00:18:11,422
You're right. I'm sorry.

402
00:18:12,158 --> 00:18:13,891
Thank you.

403
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,743
I'm sorry for calling
you a cheater.

404
00:18:17,113 --> 00:18:18,646
I am, though.

405
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:23,134
I know.

406
00:18:24,253 --> 00:18:27,254
She stared at me, too.

407
00:18:28,224 --> 00:18:31,191
But the way she stared

408
00:18:33,062 --> 00:18:34,845
felt really, really good.

409
00:18:35,998 --> 00:18:37,881
You know?

410
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:42,286
Actually, I do.

411
00:18:44,908 --> 00:18:47,424
And then he
chainsawed his leg off.

412
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:49,927
But that's not even close to
the strangest thing I've seen.

413
00:18:49,996 --> 00:18:52,613
Though, honestly, I'm not
sure that story is appropriate.

414
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:58,219
Gentlemen, that story's
gonna have to wait.

415
00:18:58,287 --> 00:19:00,687
Okay, I look forward to it.

416
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:02,201
I've been watching you. Oh.

417
00:19:02,225 --> 00:19:03,402
Chatting up our donors,

418
00:19:03,426 --> 00:19:05,404
stealing my stories.
You're a thief.

419
00:19:05,428 --> 00:19:06,955
You've been watching
me? Mmm-hmm.

420
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,762
Who are you?

421
00:19:08,831 --> 00:19:13,250
Dr. Emma Marling, maternal-fetal
medicine, Seattle Pres.

422
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:15,353
After that storm,
we've been hurting, too,

423
00:19:15,421 --> 00:19:17,254
badly.

424
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:20,023
I've been pushing our board
to throw a fund-raiser for weeks,

425
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:22,743
and I can't get any
traction. So here I am,

426
00:19:22,812 --> 00:19:25,279
borrowing yours.
I'm not a thief.

427
00:19:25,347 --> 00:19:28,115
You stole my story.
It's a good story.

428
00:19:28,183 --> 00:19:30,763
I don't get this. You are
here to get donations,

429
00:19:30,787 --> 00:19:34,427
and you spend all
this time talking to me.

430
00:19:36,042 --> 00:19:37,591
You want me to say it?

431
00:19:38,962 --> 00:19:41,845
I mean, look at you.

432
00:19:56,095 --> 00:19:58,128
Impressive party.

433
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,846
Another whiskey soda.

434
00:19:59,915 --> 00:20:01,298
That's your fifth one.

435
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:03,967
Who are you, my
mom? I'm not drinking.

436
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,369
Gotta stay sharp.

437
00:20:05,438 --> 00:20:08,338
This is for the CFO
of AEC Interactive.

438
00:20:08,407 --> 00:20:09,607
Got him on the ropes.

439
00:20:09,676 --> 00:20:10,753
Every drink he knocks back

440
00:20:10,777 --> 00:20:12,643
is another zero
added to the check

441
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:14,089
I collect at the
end of the night.

442
00:20:14,113 --> 00:20:15,462
That sounds wrong.

443
00:20:15,531 --> 00:20:17,276
Right and wrong
don't live here, son.

444
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,166
This is the Wild West.

445
00:20:19,234 --> 00:20:20,433
This is so much fun!

446
00:20:20,502 --> 00:20:22,720
It's like when we were interns,

447
00:20:22,789 --> 00:20:25,072
stealing surgeries,
playing dirty.

448
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,841
I don't really get
to do that anymore.

449
00:20:28,193 --> 00:20:29,877
Does this look stupid?

450
00:20:29,946 --> 00:20:33,080
The kid spit up on my
dress, and in my dress.

451
00:20:33,149 --> 00:20:34,481
All over, really.

452
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:38,485
Oh, for the love of God,
Mer. You're making it so easy.

453
00:20:38,554 --> 00:20:41,622
Every night, Harvey would
whisper, "I love you," into my ear

454
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:44,291
just as I was falling asleep.

455
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,661
It's been 10 years
since, and still,

456
00:20:46,729 --> 00:20:49,797
every night, I feel like
I can hear his voice.

457
00:20:49,866 --> 00:20:52,366
Do you ever feel like that,
like she's still with you?

458
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:55,514
<i>All right. Can I have
your attention, please?</i>

459
00:20:55,538 --> 00:20:59,006
Oh, speech! Speech!
Everybody, hush up!

460
00:20:59,075 --> 00:21:02,426
Oh, sorry. He's gonna talk now.

461
00:21:02,495 --> 00:21:06,330
<i>Thank you. Good evening, ladies
and gentlemen. I am Dr. Jackson Avery.</i>

462
00:21:06,399 --> 00:21:09,934
<i>And on behalf of the board of
Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital,</i>

463
00:21:10,003 --> 00:21:11,802
<i>I just want to say, "Welcome."</i>

464
00:21:13,089 --> 00:21:16,757
<i>Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you very much.</i>

465
00:21:16,826 --> 00:21:19,810
<i>Now over the past year,
we have seen many changes,</i>

466
00:21:19,878 --> 00:21:22,613
<i>from a change in name
to a change in leadership.</i>

467
00:21:22,682 --> 00:21:24,414
<i>And it has all been a challenge.</i>

468
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:25,699
<i>But it's been a challenge</i>

469
00:21:25,768 --> 00:21:28,051
<i>that we've all been more
than happy to accept.</i>

470
00:21:31,424 --> 00:21:33,207
<i>Thank you.</i>

471
00:21:33,276 --> 00:21:34,603
<i>As surgeons...</i>

472
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:36,027
Wait!

473
00:21:42,651 --> 00:21:44,752
Was that part of
it? I don't think so.

474
00:21:51,444 --> 00:21:52,954
Oh, no, no, no!
You need to stop.

475
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:54,506
You could have internal
injuries or breaks.

476
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:57,264
Um... I think I'm okay. See?

477
00:21:57,333 --> 00:21:58,915
I'm okay. I'm fine.

478
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:00,228
Ow!

479
00:22:03,172 --> 00:22:05,556
So, yeah, I'd say
there's a break.

480
00:22:09,395 --> 00:22:10,805
What's the update on
those paramedics, Avery?

481
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:12,246
Should be here any minute.

482
00:22:12,315 --> 00:22:15,866
No pulse. Okay. Hold
still. This is gonna hurt.

483
00:22:15,935 --> 00:22:18,402
Ready on my count. One, two...

484
00:22:18,454 --> 00:22:19,715
Three!

485
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,434
Do you think he's watching? Who?

486
00:22:22,458 --> 00:22:24,875
Richie Rich. 'Cause we look
freaking amazing right now.

487
00:22:24,943 --> 00:22:26,544
Cristina, gross!

488
00:22:29,164 --> 00:22:30,531
Edwards, someone
better be dying.

489
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,177
I'm really hoping to
avoid that, Dr. Yang.

490
00:22:32,201 --> 00:22:34,679
Ross is doing a pericardial
window in the ER.

491
00:22:34,703 --> 00:22:36,620
<i>Okay, when he
aspirates the fluid,</i>

492
00:22:36,672 --> 00:22:38,983
get him to the
OR. I'm on my way.

493
00:22:39,007 --> 00:22:41,942
- Go. We got this.
- This way, guys.

494
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:43,955
Where are you going?
Oh, back to the hospital.

495
00:22:43,979 --> 00:22:46,162
Some junkie with
endocarditis is tamponading.

496
00:22:46,231 --> 00:22:48,459
Which junkie?
There's more than one?

497
00:22:48,483 --> 00:22:50,629
- It's all about forgiveness.
- Mmm-hmm.

498
00:22:50,653 --> 00:22:53,687
And that's what's important.

499
00:22:54,824 --> 00:22:58,759
He sees me for who I am.

500
00:22:58,828 --> 00:23:02,329
And he accepts me
for what I've done.

501
00:23:05,268 --> 00:23:07,984
But that's everything.

502
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:09,686
Are we talking about
Matthew or Jesus?

503
00:23:11,591 --> 00:23:13,035
Dr. Robbins? Yes!

504
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:14,959
You paged me... Hi.

505
00:23:15,027 --> 00:23:18,245
To a closet? I need you
to run across to the gala

506
00:23:18,314 --> 00:23:24,885
and grab a bottle of champagne
because we're low. We are low.

507
00:23:24,954 --> 00:23:27,638
You want me to steal booze
from the party I wasn't invited to?

508
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:30,474
And snacks!

509
00:23:30,543 --> 00:23:32,454
Screw this day. ARIZONA:
Uh, thank you, Murphy.

510
00:23:32,478 --> 00:23:33,521
Thank you.

511
00:23:37,884 --> 00:23:39,984
You think Callie's
ever gonna forgive me?

512
00:23:40,052 --> 00:23:41,485
Probably not.

513
00:23:41,553 --> 00:23:45,756
She's telling everybody at
the gala that you're dead.

514
00:23:45,825 --> 00:23:47,235
You know, we're
about ready to roll.

515
00:23:50,278 --> 00:23:51,518
Hey, I'm coming, too.

516
00:23:51,547 --> 00:23:53,191
How are we doing on
our fund-raising goal?

517
00:23:53,215 --> 00:23:54,326
Oh, we're not
even halfway there.

518
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:57,234
Well, then you've
got plenty to do here.

519
00:23:57,302 --> 00:23:59,570
We're taking them
out of downtown.

520
00:24:01,957 --> 00:24:03,619
I'm worried about
internal injuries.

521
00:24:03,643 --> 00:24:05,353
Make sure they rush
her to CT. All right.

522
00:24:05,377 --> 00:24:06,793
You're not coming?

523
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:09,596
We're on maternity
leave. We have a deal.

524
00:24:09,665 --> 00:24:12,382
Mer, let's go. We
need all hands on deck.

525
00:24:19,358 --> 00:24:21,358
Let me go!

526
00:24:21,427 --> 00:24:23,093
Let go! Dr. Webber, please!

527
00:24:23,162 --> 00:24:24,856
Dr. Webber... I can
take it from here.

528
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,831
I can take it. Let go!

529
00:24:29,001 --> 00:24:30,779
I don't want this.

530
00:24:33,989 --> 00:24:37,507
There's a man down
the hall. He is ornery.

531
00:24:37,576 --> 00:24:40,461
He's a jackass. He's dying.

532
00:24:40,529 --> 00:24:42,763
And he won't stop fighting,

533
00:24:42,831 --> 00:24:45,465
even though there isn't
anything I can do for him.

534
00:24:45,534 --> 00:24:46,862
And then I've got you.

535
00:24:46,886 --> 00:24:51,071
You've got a million
options, and you refuse to try.

536
00:24:53,692 --> 00:24:56,192
You have atelectasis.

537
00:24:56,261 --> 00:25:00,564
You are in danger for
pneumothorax pneumonia, RDS.

538
00:25:00,633 --> 00:25:03,266
And Meredith Grey is ready
to let you slip into a coma.

539
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:06,770
But I am not! You
breathe in through this,

540
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:09,039
your lungs get
stronger, you get better.

541
00:25:09,108 --> 00:25:10,674
It's damn simple math.

542
00:25:10,743 --> 00:25:11,875
What do you wanna do?

543
00:25:29,929 --> 00:25:31,061
This is dumb. Put this on.

544
00:25:31,129 --> 00:25:32,196
No. No.

545
00:25:32,264 --> 00:25:34,148
Richard! Richard!

546
00:25:35,984 --> 00:25:39,169
Get the hell out.

547
00:25:55,854 --> 00:25:58,956
Let's take him off bypass
and see how we did.

548
00:26:01,026 --> 00:26:03,226
Everything okay, Dr. Yang?

549
00:26:03,295 --> 00:26:05,576
Pericardial window is a
pretty risky move for an intern.

550
00:26:06,599 --> 00:26:07,964
I didn't have a choice.

551
00:26:08,033 --> 00:26:09,977
The fluid was too thick
for a pericardiocentesis.

552
00:26:10,001 --> 00:26:11,334
You had a choice.

553
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:13,081
You could have called someone
the minute he tamponaded,

554
00:26:13,105 --> 00:26:14,671
but you didn't.

555
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:18,024
You basically got to
do a surgery in the ER.

556
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:22,846
And now you're up here with me,
while Edwards is down in the pit.

557
00:26:22,915 --> 00:26:25,432
You're a shark.
I'm not! I swear.

558
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:27,934
Ross, it's a good thing.

559
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:30,054
All great surgeons are sharks.

560
00:26:30,122 --> 00:26:33,590
You see what you want and
do whatever it takes to get it.

561
00:26:33,659 --> 00:26:36,076
Like me. And never apologize.

562
00:26:36,161 --> 00:26:37,227
Sharks don't apologize.

563
00:26:39,699 --> 00:26:41,648
Monitor. MAN: Here you go.

564
00:26:41,717 --> 00:26:43,411
Where's that coming from?

565
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:45,630
It's coming from inside. That
means we have two options.

566
00:26:45,654 --> 00:26:48,321
One, we can put him back
on bypass, undo all our work,

567
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:51,258
and find the source, or,

568
00:26:51,327 --> 00:26:53,260
two, I can take a
guess, throw in a u-stitch

569
00:26:53,329 --> 00:26:55,996
and hope I don't shred
the heart in the process.

570
00:26:56,065 --> 00:26:58,081
Dr. Ross, what do you think?

571
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:01,751
Sharks don't swim backward.
Only forward. Or they die.

572
00:27:03,372 --> 00:27:05,155
Option two it is. 4-0 Prolene.

573
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:06,447
Here you go.

574
00:27:21,657 --> 00:27:22,777
<i>There it is.</i>

575
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:25,186
<i>What's supposed to happen?</i>

576
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:28,762
If it worked, nothing.
If it didn't, lots.

577
00:27:44,513 --> 00:27:47,714
That'll do, sharky. That'll do.

578
00:27:54,757 --> 00:27:57,390
Murphy, those aren't
for you. Yeah, I know.

579
00:28:00,562 --> 00:28:02,396
Have you seen my wife?

580
00:28:02,464 --> 00:28:05,064
Uh, she, uh, hopped on
a rig with the paramedics.

581
00:28:05,134 --> 00:28:06,799
Damn it.

582
00:28:06,868 --> 00:28:08,502
Hey, Shepherd? Shepherd!

583
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:09,847
Wilson, where the hell is Karev?

584
00:28:09,871 --> 00:28:11,422
Question of the night!

585
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:12,934
You know, I should
be at work right now.

586
00:28:12,958 --> 00:28:14,502
You know, Stephanie doesn't
realize how lucky she is.

587
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:16,621
She should be thanking you
instead of being pissed at you.

588
00:28:16,645 --> 00:28:18,479
Yeah. Wait, what?

589
00:28:18,564 --> 00:28:21,042
She wanted to come
tonight? She bought a dress.

590
00:28:21,066 --> 00:28:22,911
She never said
anything. Of course not.

591
00:28:22,935 --> 00:28:24,846
If she had to say something,
it wouldn't mean as much

592
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:26,014
as if you'd had the
idea on your own.

593
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:28,388
Oh, my God. My
head hurts so much.

594
00:28:28,457 --> 00:28:29,667
It doesn't matter now.

595
00:28:29,691 --> 00:28:30,841
The party died the minute

596
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:32,120
the aerialist fell on Big Bird.

597
00:28:32,144 --> 00:28:34,077
People see a woman's
tibia impale her own foot,

598
00:28:34,146 --> 00:28:36,191
it's hard to steer the
conversation in a different direction.

599
00:28:36,215 --> 00:28:39,949
They're gonna be fine. All right.
There's a hospital right down...

600
00:28:40,018 --> 00:28:41,718
Down the street.

601
00:28:41,787 --> 00:28:44,747
You know what? Ladies and
gentlemen! Folks, wait a second.

602
00:28:48,927 --> 00:28:50,660
Dr. Bailey?

603
00:28:52,531 --> 00:28:54,481
Dr. Bailey, please?

604
00:28:57,386 --> 00:29:00,387
<i>Dr. Stuart to ICU.
Dr. Stuart to ICU.</i>

605
00:29:00,472 --> 00:29:02,689
What do you need?

606
00:29:02,758 --> 00:29:04,775
I haven't played
chess in a year.

607
00:29:06,145 --> 00:29:08,189
I can't keep having
this fight, Gene.

608
00:29:08,213 --> 00:29:11,114
No, I know. I just...

609
00:29:11,183 --> 00:29:14,885
The guys at the park
stopped letting me play.

610
00:29:16,789 --> 00:29:19,505
'Cause of the things I say.

611
00:29:19,574 --> 00:29:21,825
I'm not trying to offend you.

612
00:29:23,829 --> 00:29:25,662
That's not true.

613
00:29:27,066 --> 00:29:29,249
I said a couple of
those things on purpose.

614
00:29:29,334 --> 00:29:32,002
So, I'm sorry.

615
00:29:33,538 --> 00:29:36,606
You don't have to play
the game, but please.

616
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:43,146
I'm scared.

617
00:29:43,215 --> 00:29:45,248
I don't have anybody.

618
00:29:47,552 --> 00:29:49,035
I don't want to be alone.

619
00:30:00,883 --> 00:30:02,182
<i>What are you doing?</i>

620
00:30:02,251 --> 00:30:04,951
Repairing a gastric
rupture. It's fun.

621
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:06,481
<i>You can't just
decide to operate.</i>

622
00:30:06,505 --> 00:30:09,651
Derek, you're better at
charming the donors than I am.

623
00:30:09,675 --> 00:30:11,352
I admit it. You can have it.

624
00:30:11,376 --> 00:30:12,775
<i>We had a deal.</i>

625
00:30:12,845 --> 00:30:14,172
You're more than welcome
to come and join me.

626
00:30:14,196 --> 00:30:15,690
<i>Come get a little
blood on your hands.</i>

627
00:30:15,714 --> 00:30:18,034
I'll even let you
hold a retractor.

628
00:30:19,151 --> 00:30:20,351
<i>All right, I'm gonna change.</i>

629
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:32,196
Oh, this is really, really
fun, and I needed fun.

630
00:30:32,264 --> 00:30:33,847
Me, too. Yeah.

631
00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:42,856
Oh.

632
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:44,841
Can I try on your leg?

633
00:30:55,987 --> 00:30:57,620
You said what?

634
00:30:57,689 --> 00:31:01,091
I was cornered by
the Widow Amos,

635
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,760
who was, you know,
actually a widow.

636
00:31:03,828 --> 00:31:07,730
Her story was so sad, and she
took out her checkbook, and I...

637
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:09,783
Ugh, I'm so gross.

638
00:31:09,852 --> 00:31:11,534
Yeah.

639
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:14,504
I sort of get it, though.

640
00:31:14,573 --> 00:31:18,208
Really? Mmm. This
stuff, it's not easy.

641
00:31:18,277 --> 00:31:21,611
And Cristina, she keeps
pushing me to date.

642
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:24,881
God, I can't even
think about that. Yeah.

643
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:27,110
You really can't keep
telling people that she's dead.

644
00:31:27,803 --> 00:31:29,335
I know.

645
00:31:33,726 --> 00:31:35,358
Doctors, we have visitors.

646
00:31:37,495 --> 00:31:38,673
What is he up to?

647
00:31:38,697 --> 00:31:40,263
I don't know.

648
00:31:40,331 --> 00:31:42,933
<i>Okay, now if you'll notice
the pins that Dr. Torres</i>

649
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:45,852
is drilling into place,
that is the external fixation

650
00:31:45,921 --> 00:31:47,404
I was telling you about.

651
00:31:47,472 --> 00:31:49,139
Are we allowed to be here?

652
00:31:49,208 --> 00:31:51,052
Yes, I spoke with
Irina's husband.

653
00:31:51,076 --> 00:31:53,521
He said that if there's one
thing that she believes in,

654
00:31:53,545 --> 00:31:55,678
it's that the show must go on.

655
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:58,282
Now we showed you
guys a circus tonight.

656
00:31:58,350 --> 00:32:01,218
But this, this is the real show.

657
00:32:01,286 --> 00:32:02,869
This is what we do here.

658
00:32:02,937 --> 00:32:05,522
We are gonna get this
woman back on her feet.

659
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:07,034
And then before you
leave this evening,

660
00:32:07,058 --> 00:32:10,538
I would ask that you please
consider helping us get back on ours.

661
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:16,933
How much do you need?

662
00:32:25,527 --> 00:32:27,110
Wow!

663
00:32:27,179 --> 00:32:29,562
I usually have really
good radar for this crap.

664
00:32:29,631 --> 00:32:31,042
What are you talking about?

665
00:32:31,066 --> 00:32:32,799
What the hell is this?

666
00:32:32,868 --> 00:32:34,200
Oh, that's not funny.

667
00:32:34,269 --> 00:32:36,719
Don't freaking joke
like that. I don't do that.

668
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:38,449
I'm just trying to do
a freakin' blood draw.

669
00:32:38,473 --> 00:32:39,956
Why?

670
00:32:40,025 --> 00:32:41,675
I think my dad's
in the hospital.

671
00:32:41,744 --> 00:32:43,744
I don't understand
what that means.

672
00:32:43,811 --> 00:32:46,579
I don't know. I can't...

673
00:32:46,648 --> 00:32:48,581
I haven't seen him in 20 years.

674
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:51,184
And this guy, some old junkie,

675
00:32:51,253 --> 00:32:54,821
crashed a car, has no
ID, he's ragged, wrecked,

676
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:57,524
but his voice in the ER,
guy called me Sinatra.

677
00:32:57,593 --> 00:32:59,876
It was like somebody poured
ice water down my neck.

678
00:32:59,944 --> 00:33:01,022
That feeling hasn't gone away.

679
00:33:01,046 --> 00:33:02,357
So this is a paternity test?

680
00:33:02,381 --> 00:33:03,713
I don't know.

681
00:33:03,782 --> 00:33:05,114
No.

682
00:33:05,183 --> 00:33:06,917
I thought I could
live the rest of my life

683
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:09,085
and never see him again.

684
00:33:09,154 --> 00:33:10,887
I don't want it to be him.

685
00:33:10,956 --> 00:33:12,968
If you take the test,
then you'll know for sure.

686
00:33:12,992 --> 00:33:15,273
If it isn't him, then that
feeling will go away.

687
00:33:16,144 --> 00:33:18,645
I guess that's true.
Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

688
00:33:18,714 --> 00:33:20,358
You know, I'm
actually pretty smart.

689
00:33:20,382 --> 00:33:22,226
You'd know that if
you tried talking to me

690
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:24,851
instead of ditching
me at fancy parties.

691
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,653
I'm sorry. Yeah.

692
00:33:26,722 --> 00:33:27,787
Okay.

693
00:33:33,012 --> 00:33:34,556
That surgery was incredible.

694
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:36,391
I haven't felt this
relaxed in months.

695
00:33:36,415 --> 00:33:37,415
Me either.

696
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:43,369
What? Reminiscing.

697
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:44,737
About?

698
00:33:44,806 --> 00:33:48,040
You, me, an exam
room, and your panties

699
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:49,976
pinned to a bulletin board.

700
00:33:50,044 --> 00:33:51,611
Oh, the prom.

701
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,880
Except you didn't
have blood on your suit,

702
00:33:53,949 --> 00:33:55,292
and I wasn't
wearing a sweatshirt.

703
00:33:55,316 --> 00:33:56,556
I think it's sexy.

704
00:33:58,003 --> 00:34:00,336
Now you're doing
the sparkly eye thing.

705
00:34:00,405 --> 00:34:03,134
I have no idea what you're
talking about. Mmm-hmm.

706
00:34:03,158 --> 00:34:04,252
Is it working?

707
00:34:11,633 --> 00:34:13,983
Hey, hey! What's this?

708
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:15,146
You're getting a roommate.

709
00:34:15,170 --> 00:34:17,270
Gene, Richard. Richard, Gene.

710
00:34:17,339 --> 00:34:18,855
Calm down, Dick.

711
00:34:18,924 --> 00:34:20,201
The way you look, can't imagine

712
00:34:20,225 --> 00:34:22,086
you're gonna be around
much longer anyway.

713
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:25,312
These are a few
options for facilities

714
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:27,513
that assist with
end-of-life care.

715
00:34:27,582 --> 00:34:29,742
Since you two are
in the same boat,

716
00:34:29,768 --> 00:34:32,569
figured you could go
through them together.

717
00:34:35,374 --> 00:34:37,457
Crack a window when you go.

718
00:34:37,526 --> 00:34:39,642
Smells like
something died in here.

719
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:51,988
Jake's in the ICU, should pull
through. How are things down here?

720
00:34:52,057 --> 00:34:53,290
Oh, you know.

721
00:34:53,358 --> 00:34:55,286
Only amazing.

722
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:57,109
I cannot believe

723
00:34:57,178 --> 00:34:59,540
I was in such a snit over
not going to a stupid party.

724
00:34:59,564 --> 00:35:03,099
I mean, I have done
burr holes, a crike,

725
00:35:03,168 --> 00:35:06,786
and I pulled a hunk of glass
this big out of a dude's face!

726
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:10,434
You were totally
right. I am a rock star.

727
00:35:10,458 --> 00:35:12,536
You are a rock star.
We are rock stars.

728
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,494
We're not rock
stars. We're sharks.

729
00:35:14,562 --> 00:35:16,322
We're rock sharks!

730
00:35:19,484 --> 00:35:20,517
Hey.

731
00:35:27,942 --> 00:35:29,643
Okay, then.

732
00:35:29,711 --> 00:35:30,910
Jackson!

733
00:35:36,201 --> 00:35:38,562
I heard you were here.
I just wanted to, um,

734
00:35:38,586 --> 00:35:39,731
catch you before you leave.

735
00:35:39,755 --> 00:35:40,898
Here I am.

736
00:35:40,922 --> 00:35:45,258
I like the blue. Oh, thank you.

737
00:35:45,326 --> 00:35:47,493
Oh!

738
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:50,946
There are more zeroes
than fit in this little box.

739
00:35:51,015 --> 00:35:52,081
Let's get outta here.

740
00:35:53,418 --> 00:35:55,352
To, uh, where?

741
00:35:56,221 --> 00:35:57,654
Come on. Don't be coy.

742
00:35:57,723 --> 00:35:58,938
You like me.

743
00:35:59,006 --> 00:36:00,785
There's no way this
was all about the money.

744
00:36:00,809 --> 00:36:02,342
Oh...

745
00:36:02,411 --> 00:36:04,811
No, it was all about the money.

746
00:36:05,563 --> 00:36:06,947
You flirt with me all night,

747
00:36:07,015 --> 00:36:08,981
get me to write this big check,

748
00:36:09,050 --> 00:36:11,000
and then nothing?

749
00:36:11,069 --> 00:36:13,219
Yeah.

750
00:36:13,287 --> 00:36:17,189
And you don't feel even
a little bit bad about that?

751
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:19,676
No.

752
00:36:19,745 --> 00:36:20,955
That's actually even hotter.

753
00:36:20,979 --> 00:36:23,747
You have a good night.

754
00:36:23,815 --> 00:36:25,242
It doesn't have to
be all about money.

755
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:26,694
You could sleep
with me for free.

756
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:37,343
I have to talk to you.

757
00:36:37,412 --> 00:36:40,324
Look, I don't know what
happened... Oh, would you stop?

758
00:36:40,348 --> 00:36:41,960
I've been here too
many times, honestly.

759
00:36:41,984 --> 00:36:43,828
I'm too old. I'm too busy to
be playing games with you.

760
00:36:43,852 --> 00:36:45,652
I'm not playing games.

761
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:46,981
You're pissed because I didn't
invite you to this stupid thing,

762
00:36:47,005 --> 00:36:48,666
and now you're getting
back at me with Ross.

763
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:50,284
That's not true. Oh,
you're not pissed at me?

764
00:36:50,308 --> 00:36:52,158
Yes! I was. Yeah, I was, okay?

765
00:36:52,227 --> 00:36:54,127
You threw a party,
and you didn't invite me.

766
00:36:54,195 --> 00:36:55,589
So, yeah, my feelings
were hurt a little bit.

767
00:36:55,613 --> 00:36:58,281
But that has nothing to do
with what happened in the ER.

768
00:36:58,333 --> 00:37:00,199
Ross kissed me.

769
00:37:00,268 --> 00:37:01,712
I don't know where it came from.

770
00:37:01,736 --> 00:37:03,369
I did not ask for it.

771
00:37:04,906 --> 00:37:06,256
I swear.

772
00:37:08,493 --> 00:37:09,992
Fine.

773
00:37:10,062 --> 00:37:12,879
Fine? Yeah, fine.

774
00:37:14,766 --> 00:37:16,899
And this wasn't a
party. This was work.

775
00:37:16,968 --> 00:37:19,368
Nobody wanted to come.
I never thought you did.

776
00:37:20,338 --> 00:37:22,533
If you and I are gonna do this,

777
00:37:22,557 --> 00:37:24,717
you've gotta
start talking to me.

778
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,721
No more getting mad

779
00:37:26,745 --> 00:37:28,422
and then waiting to
see if I know you're mad

780
00:37:28,446 --> 00:37:30,746
or any of that. Yeah, okay.

781
00:37:35,654 --> 00:37:36,986
I didn't want him to kiss me.

782
00:37:39,724 --> 00:37:40,940
I want you to kiss me.

783
00:37:53,805 --> 00:37:55,004
Look at this.

784
00:37:56,308 --> 00:37:58,219
They got a picture
of a damned rabbit

785
00:37:58,243 --> 00:38:00,042
hopping through a meadow.

786
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:04,797
Sunshine and daisies
and friggin' bunny rabbits.

787
00:38:07,869 --> 00:38:09,302
Could be worse.

788
00:38:11,339 --> 00:38:17,009
You could die in
that bed, in this room.

789
00:38:18,512 --> 00:38:23,082
This hospital could be
the last place you see.

790
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:27,620
You don't want to die here.

791
00:38:33,845 --> 00:38:36,179
No. I don't.

792
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:43,886
It is a pretty lawn.

793
00:38:43,955 --> 00:38:48,090
If I gotta kick, could
be nice to do it outside.

794
00:38:56,217 --> 00:38:58,785
The food's gotta be better
than what they serve here.

795
00:38:58,853 --> 00:39:02,388
I wouldn't feed
that slop to a gypsy.

796
00:39:02,457 --> 00:39:03,956
Mmm.

797
00:39:04,025 --> 00:39:06,375
I said, "I wouldn't."
I was being nice.

798
00:39:40,862 --> 00:39:43,163
Hey! Are you gonna
head back up the street?

799
00:39:43,231 --> 00:39:45,042
Uh, no, I was just heading home.

800
00:39:45,066 --> 00:39:50,620
Listen, I don't blame you for not
wanting to get out there and date.

801
00:39:50,688 --> 00:39:54,657
People are gross.

802
00:39:54,726 --> 00:39:57,143
But we look great. So
you wanna go hit Joe's?

803
00:40:01,149 --> 00:40:02,965
Hey. Hi.

804
00:40:04,135 --> 00:40:05,246
Oh, sorry, am I interrupting?

805
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:06,870
You're here?

806
00:40:06,938 --> 00:40:11,607
Yeah, I, uh, really, uh, had
a good excuse all worked up,

807
00:40:11,676 --> 00:40:13,436
and now I'm completely blanking.

808
00:40:17,082 --> 00:40:20,149
I was just heading home.

809
00:40:20,218 --> 00:40:22,698
It was really nice to
meet you. You, too.

810
00:40:24,956 --> 00:40:26,205
Good night.

811
00:40:30,745 --> 00:40:35,347
<i>Overture, curtain, lights.</i>

812
00:40:46,812 --> 00:40:48,511
I have the results.

813
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:49,662
<i>This is it.</i>

814
00:40:51,549 --> 00:40:53,916
<i>The night of nights.</i>

815
00:40:53,985 --> 00:40:55,445
I don't wanna
know. He's your dad.

816
00:40:55,469 --> 00:40:56,502
What?

817
00:40:57,906 --> 00:40:59,355
Oh, my God. I jumped the gun.

818
00:40:59,424 --> 00:41:04,193
I am sorry. I am so sorry.

819
00:41:04,261 --> 00:41:06,979
Alex!

820
00:41:07,048 --> 00:41:11,467
Shotgun! I get
carsick in the back.

821
00:41:11,536 --> 00:41:12,936
Oh!

822
00:41:16,174 --> 00:41:18,942
Ugh, I might get
carsick in the front.

823
00:41:19,945 --> 00:41:21,494
Thank you.

824
00:41:21,563 --> 00:41:23,241
I'm about to take
my intern exam,

825
00:41:23,265 --> 00:41:26,165
which means I am about to
be a second-year resident.

826
00:41:26,234 --> 00:41:28,551
My babysitting days are done.

827
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:30,848
And I would appreciate,
if moving forward,

828
00:41:30,872 --> 00:41:33,272
you would treat me with
the respect that entails.

829
00:41:33,925 --> 00:41:34,974
You're adorable.

830
00:41:36,427 --> 00:41:38,794
Excuse me.

831
00:41:47,321 --> 00:41:49,481
<i>No more rehearsing
and nursing a part.</i>

832
00:41:50,325 --> 00:41:52,358
<i>We know every part by heart.</i>

833
00:41:52,427 --> 00:41:55,027
Ross, what's going on?
Multi-car mash-up in the ER.

834
00:41:59,467 --> 00:42:01,300
Be a shame to wake the kids.

835
00:42:01,369 --> 00:42:05,171
<i>Tonight, what heights we'll hit.</i>

836
00:42:07,342 --> 00:42:09,408
<i>On with the show.</i>

837
00:42:15,483 --> 00:42:16,915
<i>This is it.</i>

838
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:19,919
I'm Dr. Grey.
