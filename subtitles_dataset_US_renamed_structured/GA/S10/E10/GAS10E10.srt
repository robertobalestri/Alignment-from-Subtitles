1
00:00:12,462 --> 00:00:16,865
<i>The body is an infinitely complex
mass of interacting systems.</i>

2
00:00:18,868 --> 00:00:21,837
<i>People like to think
doctors see it all clearly.</i>

3
00:00:25,809 --> 00:00:29,361
<i>But it's not always obvious
what's a hiccup in the system,</i>

4
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:32,064
<i>and what's a full-on
medical disaster.</i>

5
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:47,413
<i>We figure that out in
our first year of residency.</i>

6
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:51,716
Hey, you sleep okay?

7
00:00:54,488 --> 00:00:55,720
Great.

8
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:59,541
<i>We spend the rest of
our careers lying about it.</i>

9
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:01,621
I probably can't write
about this in the article,

10
00:01:01,645 --> 00:01:03,556
but something about how
my toothpaste hit the sink

11
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:05,130
made me realize

12
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:07,326
that the array could be
designed asymmetrically.

13
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:09,329
Makes it more
versatile. Exactly.

14
00:01:09,353 --> 00:01:10,353
So what you're saying is

15
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:11,753
that you can't spit

16
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:14,050
without having a
genius idea. Oh.

17
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:15,774
Well, it may not work.

18
00:01:15,842 --> 00:01:18,021
Zola, are your socks on?

19
00:01:18,045 --> 00:01:20,545
It was a revolutionary
glob of spit.

20
00:01:23,167 --> 00:01:25,111
So if you need anything,
just call me and...

21
00:01:25,135 --> 00:01:26,501
No, I don't need anything.

22
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:28,080
I just need to read everything
that was ever written

23
00:01:28,104 --> 00:01:29,737
on the mediastinal teratomas

24
00:01:29,806 --> 00:01:31,873
and crank out a grant proposal.

25
00:01:31,941 --> 00:01:33,186
All I need is quiet.

26
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:34,721
Well, I can't promise
you too much quiet

27
00:01:34,745 --> 00:01:36,672
because you did say
that I could come visit.

28
00:01:36,696 --> 00:01:38,374
I did say that. Yeah.

29
00:01:38,398 --> 00:01:40,649
Oh, that's the
best part of my day.

30
00:01:40,717 --> 00:01:41,957
Mmm-hmm.

31
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:44,819
Hey, welcome back.

32
00:01:44,888 --> 00:01:48,222
Hey, thanks. Beats the
hell out of a courtroom.

33
00:01:48,291 --> 00:01:50,959
She brought muffins.

34
00:01:51,028 --> 00:01:52,906
It's her day off. She's
doing homework.

35
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:54,095
In a hospital?

36
00:01:54,164 --> 00:01:55,263
Yeah. God.

37
00:01:55,331 --> 00:01:57,599
Get some air. See
the world, right?

38
00:02:04,641 --> 00:02:05,951
I think it's sweet.

39
00:02:05,975 --> 00:02:07,159
It's adorable.

40
00:02:12,249 --> 00:02:14,227
Dr. Webber's bugging
me for another stress test.

41
00:02:14,251 --> 00:02:15,828
Oh, he failed the last
one two minutes in.

42
00:02:15,852 --> 00:02:17,612
I know, but he's
been practicing.

43
00:02:17,654 --> 00:02:19,465
As soon as I get a minute
I'll go check on him again.

44
00:02:19,489 --> 00:02:20,521
Hi.

45
00:02:20,591 --> 00:02:21,768
You're on my service again?

46
00:02:21,792 --> 00:02:23,759
I'm sorry.

47
00:02:23,827 --> 00:02:25,005
As soon as I change, I wanna go
through the computer model again

48
00:02:25,029 --> 00:02:26,239
before we start
printing the vein.

49
00:02:26,263 --> 00:02:27,729
I'm sorry. Before you do that,

50
00:02:27,798 --> 00:02:28,580
you're gonna have to go
check on your pancreas lady,

51
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:29,798
Donna Kaufman.

52
00:02:29,867 --> 00:02:31,249
Not good.

53
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:33,196
We were hoping we
could remove the tumor,

54
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,460
but it's advanced further

55
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:36,388
than we initially thought.

56
00:02:36,457 --> 00:02:39,336
The best course of action would
be to relieve your obstruction

57
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,609
and block the
nerves in the area.

58
00:02:41,678 --> 00:02:44,345
That should help with the pain.

59
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:46,114
You're not even gonna try?

60
00:02:46,183 --> 00:02:47,382
Victor.

61
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:48,667
I'm sorry.

62
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:51,336
I wish there was
more that we could do.

63
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:56,408
Dealing with the pain is
a lot better than nothing.

64
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:57,476
Let's do that.

65
00:02:58,378 --> 00:02:59,605
Okay. Okay.

66
00:02:59,629 --> 00:03:00,695
Sooner is better.

67
00:03:07,838 --> 00:03:09,749
We've been treating him with
diuretics and beta blockers,

68
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:11,568
but he's still got
a lot of edema.

69
00:03:11,592 --> 00:03:13,102
He'll rally once
we put in the graft.

70
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:14,604
Then we can get him out of here.

71
00:03:14,628 --> 00:03:16,728
Poor kid's been here
for almost three weeks.

72
00:03:16,797 --> 00:03:18,491
You done with
all the test prints?

73
00:03:18,515 --> 00:03:20,082
Yeah, we finished
them last night.

74
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:22,317
Shane's printing
out the real one now.

75
00:03:23,504 --> 00:03:27,706
Emma's here. With muffins. Mmm.

76
00:03:27,775 --> 00:03:28,852
Owen's chick?

77
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:30,052
You wanna get rid of her?

78
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:31,443
No.

79
00:03:31,512 --> 00:03:34,646
I'm glad he's getting laid.

80
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:36,025
Everyone should be getting laid.

81
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,744
I should be getting laid.
Oh, here we go again.

82
00:03:37,768 --> 00:03:40,368
My work suffers when I'm
not. It's bad for humanity.

83
00:03:40,437 --> 00:03:41,848
All right, can you
make up with Mer

84
00:03:41,872 --> 00:03:43,216
so I don't have to
talk to you about sex?

85
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,539
Why are you being such a priss?

86
00:03:44,608 --> 00:03:46,448
Don't you talk to your
guy friends about sex?

87
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:48,121
Who? Avery? No.

88
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:50,545
You don't talk about who's
got the best rack in the shack?

89
00:03:50,614 --> 00:03:51,657
Maybe.

90
00:03:51,681 --> 00:03:53,426
So you can do it
with me. Okay, fine.

91
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:57,269
Your work's suffering so bad,
then find something to play with.

92
00:03:57,337 --> 00:03:59,282
Get your yayas out
and leave me alone.

93
00:03:59,306 --> 00:04:01,706
What, like, battery-operated?

94
00:04:01,775 --> 00:04:03,391
No. Human.

95
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:04,626
A human sex toy?

96
00:04:04,695 --> 00:04:05,872
You asked.

97
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,149
How long you been there?

98
00:04:11,217 --> 00:04:12,295
Somewhere around "yayas."

99
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,319
That's great.

100
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:15,287
We have a problem.

101
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:17,472
<i>Our conduit's contaminated.</i>

102
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:18,584
How the hell did that happen?

103
00:04:18,608 --> 00:04:19,825
I don't know.

104
00:04:19,893 --> 00:04:21,705
I can print another one
and try vacuum seeding,

105
00:04:21,729 --> 00:04:23,294
but it'll take longer.

106
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:25,180
We won't be able to
do the procedure today.

107
00:04:25,248 --> 00:04:26,860
I don't know if this kid can
hang on for one more day.

108
00:04:26,884 --> 00:04:29,634
We gotta try, right?
It's still his best shot.

109
00:04:29,702 --> 00:04:31,419
I'll talk to Karev.

110
00:04:31,487 --> 00:04:33,917
Dr. Grey's supposed to have
the printer by 10:00 am today.

111
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:35,585
We made the schedule
and made a big stink

112
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:38,009
about how she
had to stick to it.

113
00:04:38,561 --> 00:04:40,161
Edwards! Hey!

114
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:41,891
Uh, can you write down
your mailing address for me?

115
00:04:41,915 --> 00:04:43,297
Sure.

116
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:46,668
I'm sending you an
invitation to my wedding.

117
00:04:46,736 --> 00:04:47,998
Thought about doing them online.

118
00:04:48,022 --> 00:04:50,000
It's better for the environment,

119
00:04:50,024 --> 00:04:51,417
I know, but I just couldn't deal
with an e-vite to my wedding.

120
00:04:51,441 --> 00:04:55,410
Great. I really
hope you'll come.

121
00:04:55,479 --> 00:04:59,080
And, um, obviously, you
can also, like, bring a guest.

122
00:05:05,289 --> 00:05:06,971
His BP's in the toilet.

123
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,018
If this procedure's not ready, you
gotta come up with something else.

124
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:11,876
It's one day. Can you relax?

125
00:05:11,929 --> 00:05:13,339
God, maybe you're
the one who needs

126
00:05:13,363 --> 00:05:14,740
a little recreational
energy release.

127
00:05:14,764 --> 00:05:17,148
I'm getting laid. Regularly.

128
00:05:17,217 --> 00:05:18,628
So all my anxiety
is based on the fact

129
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:20,151
that you brought me on this case

130
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,098
and asked me to keep a kid
alive long enough for you to do

131
00:05:22,122 --> 00:05:23,762
a fancy procedure
that's not gonna work.

132
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,793
All right, maybe it's nothing.

133
00:05:28,862 --> 00:05:30,507
But maybe it's worth
having a conversation

134
00:05:30,531 --> 00:05:31,830
with somebody in psych.

135
00:05:31,899 --> 00:05:33,175
Oh, you're making
a mountain out of...

136
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,465
Look, it can't hurt.

137
00:05:34,535 --> 00:05:36,695
Look, hell, I'd like to have
a sit-down with somebody

138
00:05:36,737 --> 00:05:38,697
and talk a couple things
out every now and then.

139
00:05:38,739 --> 00:05:40,605
Well, then you go. I
have a busy schedule.

140
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:41,873
Navel gazing is not on it.

141
00:05:41,942 --> 00:05:43,091
That's my point.

142
00:05:43,177 --> 00:05:44,993
Overloading your
schedule can exacerbate

143
00:05:45,061 --> 00:05:46,456
the kind of behaviors
you've been...

144
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,507
I'm not having behaviors.
I'm having a life.

145
00:05:48,531 --> 00:05:49,931
Like you used to have

146
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,610
when you were pursuing
something that challenged you.

147
00:05:51,634 --> 00:05:53,079
Bailey, you have
time for an ex-lap?

148
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:54,280
I got a burn patient
with a surgical abdomen.

149
00:05:54,304 --> 00:05:56,184
Absolutely. JACKSON: Trauma two.

150
00:05:59,993 --> 00:06:01,526
What do we got?

151
00:06:01,595 --> 00:06:04,112
Ella Holmes, six, hit by a car.
Tachycardic and hypotensive.

152
00:06:04,181 --> 00:06:05,658
She was on a scooter.

153
00:06:05,682 --> 00:06:07,126
She knows she's not
supposed to ride it down the hill.

154
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:08,494
I don't know what happened.
Show me the ultrasound.

155
00:06:08,518 --> 00:06:09,929
Is she gonna be okay?
Are you her mom?

156
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:11,619
They're out of town.

157
00:06:11,688 --> 00:06:12,932
Intraperitoneal free fluid.

158
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:14,067
Call CT and book
an OR just in case.

159
00:06:14,091 --> 00:06:15,724
Dr. Robbins?

160
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:17,737
She's got a supracondylar
femur fracture.

161
00:06:17,761 --> 00:06:19,260
Okay, call Torres.

162
00:06:19,329 --> 00:06:20,707
Is that gonna be okay?

163
00:06:20,731 --> 00:06:21,663
Yeah, we're on the mend.

164
00:06:21,749 --> 00:06:23,014
I'm glad to hear it.

165
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:25,233
Murphy, Go with
Torres and Robbins.

166
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:26,445
It's not a good idea.

167
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:27,981
It'll be fine. I don't think...

168
00:06:28,005 --> 00:06:29,365
Murphy!

169
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:30,750
- Pressure's dropping!
- What is that?

170
00:06:30,774 --> 00:06:32,134
I can't wait for a CT.
Prep her for the OR.

171
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:33,235
I have to call her parents.

172
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:34,420
What am I supposed to tell them?

173
00:06:34,444 --> 00:06:35,588
I'll update you as
soon as we know.

174
00:06:35,612 --> 00:06:37,252
All right, let's move,
people. Let's go.

175
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:40,672
But is everything
going to be okay?

176
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,033
It's all going to be fine.

177
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:54,591
Okay, can you
pull that lap pad out

178
00:06:54,615 --> 00:06:55,958
and see if there's any bleeding?

179
00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:57,222
Slowly.

180
00:06:58,685 --> 00:07:01,453
I don't see anything. Good.

181
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:03,466
Dr. Torres is gonna
fix the femur? Yeah.

182
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:05,301
But she'll need some help
so you should stick around.

183
00:07:05,325 --> 00:07:06,625
Well, you'll help her, right?

184
00:07:06,693 --> 00:07:08,676
I mean, you don't think
she needs two people.

185
00:07:08,745 --> 00:07:09,889
You're a resident.

186
00:07:09,913 --> 00:07:12,814
You're supposed to
beg to be in that room.

187
00:07:12,883 --> 00:07:16,062
I'm sorry if it's awkward. I
hope that it doesn't have to be.

188
00:07:16,086 --> 00:07:18,352
You two are definitely
getting back together?

189
00:07:18,421 --> 00:07:19,661
We are.

190
00:07:19,706 --> 00:07:21,184
Like you're trying
it out or like...

191
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:22,974
Leah.

192
00:07:23,042 --> 00:07:24,620
You don't wanna be
the person who says,

193
00:07:24,644 --> 00:07:28,546
"I'll wait for you in case it
doesn't work out with your wife."

194
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,697
So you're trying to
find a woman for him

195
00:07:34,721 --> 00:07:37,271
to be with once you've passed.

196
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,851
I know it sounds strange.

197
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:41,276
But I don't want
him to be alone.

198
00:07:41,345 --> 00:07:43,929
And if he's on his own,
I don't think he'll do it.

199
00:07:43,997 --> 00:07:46,331
It's certainly unusual.

200
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:49,483
But I understand.
You love your husband.

201
00:07:51,321 --> 00:07:52,787
It's not my husband.

202
00:07:52,855 --> 00:07:55,456
I mean, I love my husband.

203
00:07:55,542 --> 00:07:58,275
But this is for
someone else. Stan.

204
00:07:58,344 --> 00:08:00,478
He's a very special friend.

205
00:08:02,716 --> 00:08:05,717
Donna, I'm gonna need
to get at that left arm.

206
00:08:07,571 --> 00:08:09,381
Yeah, it's a lot more versatile.

207
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:11,039
Well, it's an
improvement, no question.

208
00:08:11,107 --> 00:08:12,618
Maybe if you have
time over lunch,

209
00:08:12,642 --> 00:08:14,119
you can look over the proposal.

210
00:08:14,143 --> 00:08:16,778
I wish I could. I've got
back-to-back surgeries.

211
00:08:16,846 --> 00:08:19,175
How's it feel to be back
in the anesthesia game?

212
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,431
It's fine.

213
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,634
Not ideal, but, you
know, got a family.

214
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:23,969
You make compromises.

215
00:08:24,037 --> 00:08:25,999
Yeah, Meredith is gonna kill me.

216
00:08:26,023 --> 00:08:27,700
What, she doesn't like
an symmetrical array?

217
00:08:27,724 --> 00:08:29,302
I'm supposed to be downshifting,

218
00:08:29,326 --> 00:08:30,854
and she's supposed
to be upshifting.

219
00:08:30,878 --> 00:08:33,745
Ah. And yet you find
inspiration in toothpaste.

220
00:08:33,814 --> 00:08:35,341
Maybe next time,
you keep it to yourself.

221
00:08:35,365 --> 00:08:37,309
That works for you?
In a marriage? Yes.

222
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:38,783
You keep your mouth shut.

223
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:44,606
Although, uh, Miranda's
been kind of struggling lately.

224
00:08:44,675 --> 00:08:47,141
She has what, uh, if
you squint real hard

225
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:49,844
looks a lot like OCD.

226
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,180
Bailey? Yeah.

227
00:08:52,248 --> 00:08:54,288
She had that incident
with the hole in the gloves.

228
00:08:54,334 --> 00:08:55,745
I knew it freaked her
out, but I was away.

229
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:57,569
I didn't know how
much it freaked her out.

230
00:08:57,638 --> 00:08:58,848
You really think it's OCD?

231
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:00,288
I don't know.

232
00:09:00,356 --> 00:09:01,834
I wanted to let her
deal with it her way,

233
00:09:01,858 --> 00:09:03,302
but I'm not sure
she's dealing with it.

234
00:09:03,326 --> 00:09:04,637
We were in the OR the other day,

235
00:09:04,661 --> 00:09:06,188
and she kept the patient
under easily an extra hour.

236
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:07,245
Ben...

237
00:09:07,314 --> 00:09:08,641
She went past
that. I'm not sure...

238
00:09:08,665 --> 00:09:10,009
No, I know, I know. I
should stay out of it.

239
00:09:10,033 --> 00:09:11,243
But when I'm watching
a surgeon perform

240
00:09:11,267 --> 00:09:12,778
what looks like
unnecessary procedures...

241
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,897
I am on the board
of this hospital.

242
00:09:14,921 --> 00:09:16,287
I can't hear about

243
00:09:16,356 --> 00:09:18,596
a physician's misconduct
and not report it.

244
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:23,706
I think you telling Dr. Grey
is gonna go over better than...

245
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,908
No, I don't have time to
manage her feelings right now.

246
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:29,067
Just apologize, we feel
terrible, it won't happen again.

247
00:09:29,136 --> 00:09:31,753
She'll be pissy,
but she'll get over it.

248
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,972
I could have Edwards tell
her. She's on her service.

249
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:35,473
Even better.

250
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:44,916
If you ever need
any yaya extraction...

251
00:09:47,237 --> 00:09:48,986
Getting the yayas out...

252
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:52,790
I'm available.

253
00:09:57,313 --> 00:10:00,081
Are you offering to service me?

254
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:01,894
Sorry. It was inappropriate.

255
00:10:01,918 --> 00:10:04,998
It's just, you know, for
the sake of the work.

256
00:10:05,422 --> 00:10:06,954
That's even worse.

257
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:08,122
You're supposed to claim

258
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:10,157
that you're in love
with me or something.

259
00:10:10,227 --> 00:10:12,037
Well, I certainly find you
attractive. There's no question.

260
00:10:12,061 --> 00:10:14,306
I mean, I wouldn't be so
presumptuous as to assume it's...

261
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:15,530
Stop talking.

262
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:21,319
Good.

263
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:23,599
Hey, are those left over
from the morning meeting?

264
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,423
Uh-huh. She baked them.

265
00:10:25,492 --> 00:10:26,791
You're kidding.

266
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,493
I kind of hate you. Mmm.

267
00:10:28,562 --> 00:10:31,713
Yeah, I kinda hate me, too. Mmm.

268
00:10:31,781 --> 00:10:34,026
Hmm. If she's cooking
your Thanksgiving dinner,

269
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,333
I want the leftovers.

270
00:10:35,402 --> 00:10:37,242
Oh, I'm not... Oh, we're not...

271
00:10:37,286 --> 00:10:38,552
Well, I mean, we could.

272
00:10:38,621 --> 00:10:39,832
No, you don't have to say that.

273
00:10:39,856 --> 00:10:41,372
I hadn't given it
much thought so...

274
00:10:41,441 --> 00:10:43,908
Sorry, I didn't mean to
open a can of worms. I just...

275
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:45,321
I mean, you could do
what we do at my house,

276
00:10:45,345 --> 00:10:47,428
which is act like it's
not even happening.

277
00:10:47,497 --> 00:10:51,349
So, you're not going
home to your family, or...

278
00:10:51,418 --> 00:10:52,850
I'm on call the next day.

279
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:54,268
Oh. Well, we could do something.

280
00:10:54,337 --> 00:10:56,348
Oh, they're painting
my apartment next week.

281
00:10:56,372 --> 00:10:58,101
And we can't really
cook in the trailer.

282
00:10:58,125 --> 00:11:00,375
Why not? We could
just eat outdoors, and...

283
00:11:00,444 --> 00:11:02,226
In November? Yeah.

284
00:11:02,295 --> 00:11:05,613
You could cook at my house.
You'd have to feed us, too, but...

285
00:11:05,682 --> 00:11:06,981
That could be fun.

286
00:11:07,049 --> 00:11:08,394
I don't wanna
commandeer your kitchen.

287
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:10,446
Oh, please. Someone should.

288
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:13,504
They made those construction
paper turkeys at Zola's school,

289
00:11:13,573 --> 00:11:16,240
and she had no idea what
they were talking about.

290
00:11:16,309 --> 00:11:18,275
You'd make me look
like a better mother.

291
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,344
Think about it.

292
00:11:19,413 --> 00:11:20,973
Pancreatic tumor. Gotta go.

293
00:11:20,997 --> 00:11:22,696
Mmm-hmm.

294
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:24,605
Thanks. Welcome.

295
00:11:26,369 --> 00:11:27,646
Do you have Donna's pre-op labs?

296
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:29,186
In process.

297
00:11:29,255 --> 00:11:31,089
I'm gonna go examine Dr. Webber.

298
00:11:31,158 --> 00:11:33,452
And when I get back, we're
gonna get started on the printer.

299
00:11:33,476 --> 00:11:34,893
Is that okay with you?

300
00:11:34,961 --> 00:11:36,310
Yeah.

301
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,114
Pfft, what was that about?

302
00:11:40,183 --> 00:11:43,195
I got her kicked off her
own surgery a few days ago.

303
00:11:43,219 --> 00:11:44,319
Alex told me. Ballsy.

304
00:11:44,387 --> 00:11:46,204
Stupid.

305
00:11:46,273 --> 00:11:47,716
Did Kepner invite
you to her wedding?

306
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,240
No.

307
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:50,887
So she didn't ask
you for your address?

308
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:53,561
No, but I'm sure Alex is
invited. I'm probably the plus one.

309
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,808
Hey, Dr. Yang needs
the printer again today.

310
00:11:55,832 --> 00:11:57,014
Uh, no.

311
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,260
One day. Tell Grey we're sorry.

312
00:11:58,284 --> 00:11:59,099
No, you tell her. Can't.

313
00:11:59,169 --> 00:12:00,279
Gotta get the printer going

314
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:01,547
so we only take one day
away from you, not two.

315
00:12:01,571 --> 00:12:03,182
Shane... Dying baby
waiting on a part.

316
00:12:03,206 --> 00:12:04,389
No...

317
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:05,523
Get back here!

318
00:12:05,592 --> 00:12:07,057
I'm a waste of a bed.

319
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:09,004
Your stress test was a disaster.

320
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:11,662
You want me to dwell
on all your past failures?

321
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:13,698
I'm a different man
than I was last week.

322
00:12:13,767 --> 00:12:15,800
I exercise.

323
00:12:15,869 --> 00:12:18,280
I don't know why you don't think
about going into a rehab facility.

324
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:20,215
We can get you in there
even if you don't pass.

325
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:23,140
Look, I don't want
to go to a facility.

326
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:24,608
It's bad enough I'm here.

327
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:27,511
Where everyone knows
me. And has to be nice.

328
00:12:27,564 --> 00:12:29,308
Well, you can't go home alone.

329
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:31,298
I'll get a home health aide.

330
00:12:31,367 --> 00:12:33,295
I'll have Wilson run
another stress test.

331
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:36,254
You watch. Flying colors.

332
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:37,750
If you get out of here in time,

333
00:12:37,774 --> 00:12:39,585
you can have Thanksgiving
dinner at our house

334
00:12:39,609 --> 00:12:41,336
if you and Catherine
don't have plans.

335
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,593
You cookin'?

336
00:12:42,662 --> 00:12:43,873
Is that so preposterous?

337
00:12:43,897 --> 00:12:45,413
You want a straight answer?

338
00:12:45,481 --> 00:12:47,982
No, Owen's
girlfriend is cooking.

339
00:12:48,051 --> 00:12:49,728
Does she put
mushrooms in her stuffing?

340
00:12:49,752 --> 00:12:50,992
I find it makes it soggy.

341
00:12:53,757 --> 00:12:54,877
Hey.

342
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:57,541
Hey. You done already?

343
00:12:57,611 --> 00:12:59,321
No, she was too edematous.

344
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:01,257
We packed her and put
in a temporary closure.

345
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:03,075
You can do her femur
tomorrow after we close.

346
00:13:03,099 --> 00:13:04,198
Okay.

347
00:13:06,436 --> 00:13:08,953
I wanna talk to you
about something. Hmm?

348
00:13:10,407 --> 00:13:14,442
I was with someone
when we were apart.

349
00:13:14,511 --> 00:13:16,455
I don't think that it was
completely out-of-bounds.

350
00:13:16,479 --> 00:13:19,213
We were separated, and you'd
kicked me out of the house.

351
00:13:19,282 --> 00:13:21,099
Oh, so it's my fault?

352
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:25,169
There are no faults. I just
feel like you should know.

353
00:13:25,238 --> 00:13:27,155
We're starting fresh,

354
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:29,507
and I wanna be honest with you.

355
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:30,886
I shouldn't have said anything.

356
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,150
No, no.

357
00:13:32,211 --> 00:13:34,345
I'm sorry. You're right.

358
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:35,747
Thank you

359
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,466
for being so very honest.

360
00:13:39,719 --> 00:13:41,085
I'm trying.

361
00:13:43,023 --> 00:13:45,723
Is there anything that
you wanna ask me?

362
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:48,175
Oh, wow. Um...

363
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:50,110
No.

364
00:13:51,447 --> 00:13:52,880
I don't know.

365
00:13:53,783 --> 00:13:55,433
Was it once?

366
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:56,818
It was more than once.

367
00:13:58,637 --> 00:13:59,877
More than twice?

368
00:14:02,325 --> 00:14:04,124
More than 10?

369
00:14:04,193 --> 00:14:06,739
You know what? I don't
wanna know anything about it.

370
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:08,278
I'm sorry.

371
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:09,747
Is it over?

372
00:14:09,815 --> 00:14:12,050
Yes. Completely.

373
00:14:14,003 --> 00:14:16,837
Okay. That's all I need to know.

374
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,550
You didn't? What?

375
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:22,776
Cheat on you?

376
00:14:22,845 --> 00:14:24,706
Get involved with anyone?

377
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:27,465
I got involved with myself.

378
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:30,368
I danced in my underwear,

379
00:14:30,437 --> 00:14:33,837
and I tried to remember that I
used to be a person who had fun.

380
00:14:35,525 --> 00:14:39,127
I'm really trying.
Callie, please.

381
00:14:39,195 --> 00:14:41,128
Tell me that you're trying, too.

382
00:14:41,748 --> 00:14:42,847
I am.

383
00:14:43,682 --> 00:14:45,250
Can I hug you?

384
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:47,485
Yeah.

385
00:14:53,093 --> 00:14:54,325
I really missed you.

386
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:55,909
Me, too.

387
00:14:58,164 --> 00:14:59,830
Sorry.

388
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,901
Uh... Ella's thigh is really
swollen. She's hypotensive.

389
00:15:02,969 --> 00:15:04,479
All right, we gotta
get her back in the OR

390
00:15:04,503 --> 00:15:06,403
and do the femur right now.

391
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:08,990
Um... Are you gonna help me?

392
00:15:09,059 --> 00:15:11,059
Sure.

393
00:15:11,127 --> 00:15:12,638
Will you give the
family an update?

394
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:16,897
They're on a plane.
It's just the babysitter.

395
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:19,000
Dr. Grey.

396
00:15:19,069 --> 00:15:20,746
I have to stop in post-ops.

397
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:22,481
Tell Wilson to run a
stress test on Dr. Webber...

398
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:24,271
They need the
printer today. Dr. Yang.

399
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,940
What? No. Sorry.

400
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:27,853
They said it's not up for
discussion. They're already running it.

401
00:15:27,877 --> 00:15:29,343
I mean, I tried to talk to Ross,

402
00:15:29,412 --> 00:15:32,747
but he said Dr. Yang isn't
even interested in having...

403
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:44,753
Nurses' station.
We need to talk.

404
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,055
We really don't. No, we do.

405
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:47,924
I have to wrap up a patient
in the ER. Back here in 15?

406
00:15:47,948 --> 00:15:49,025
Yes. Great. Okay.

407
00:15:49,049 --> 00:15:50,576
Dr. Hunt? Mmm-hmm?

408
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,360
Hey, so I invited
Dr. Webber to Thanksgiving,

409
00:15:52,384 --> 00:15:53,768
so now it really has to happen.

410
00:15:53,837 --> 00:15:55,881
His lady is cooking
Thanksgiving dinner at our house.

411
00:15:55,905 --> 00:15:56,954
Oh, that's nice.

412
00:15:57,023 --> 00:15:58,656
Should we invite more people?

413
00:15:58,724 --> 00:16:02,159
Well, uh, if we're making a whole
turkey, we can invite a few more.

414
00:16:02,228 --> 00:16:04,044
Okay, let's get
Dr. Yang here, please.

415
00:16:04,113 --> 00:16:05,924
You and Bailey can come.
We're going to my family.

416
00:16:05,948 --> 00:16:07,659
Assuming she's still
speaking to me by then.

417
00:16:07,683 --> 00:16:09,979
Hmm. We should
probably invite Callie.

418
00:16:10,003 --> 00:16:11,913
I'm sure with the trial, I'm
sure she didn't have time...

419
00:16:11,937 --> 00:16:14,116
So we're not inviting
Arizona. We can't have both.

420
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,934
They're back together,
so... They are?

421
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:17,102
Hey, can you go do your thing

422
00:16:17,126 --> 00:16:18,937
so we can get to our thing? Yes.

423
00:16:18,961 --> 00:16:20,422
So we're not inviting Yang,
right? Because that wouldn't be...

424
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:21,979
Uh, she probably has plans.

425
00:16:22,048 --> 00:16:23,728
No, she probably doesn't. - Oh.

426
00:16:24,617 --> 00:16:26,317
Do you have Thanksgiving plans?

427
00:16:26,386 --> 00:16:28,047
What do you think?
My house. 3:00.

428
00:16:28,071 --> 00:16:30,031
All right, I'm
bringing Jo. I figured.

429
00:16:30,073 --> 00:16:31,472
Don't sound so excited.

430
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:33,607
You were an intern
balling an attending once.

431
00:16:33,676 --> 00:16:34,775
Mmm-hmm.

432
00:16:34,844 --> 00:16:36,544
You kiss my kids
with that mouth?

433
00:16:36,613 --> 00:16:37,789
I got a pre-op. It'll be fast.

434
00:16:37,813 --> 00:16:39,592
But do not start with
Hunt until I get back.

435
00:16:39,616 --> 00:16:41,732
I won't. WOMAN: Thank you.

436
00:16:41,801 --> 00:16:43,067
You don't wanna know.

437
00:16:43,136 --> 00:16:45,180
I called Dr. Yang. She's
not available right now.

438
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:47,199
Does she know it's me
who's asking for her?

439
00:16:47,223 --> 00:16:48,263
Yes.

440
00:16:51,794 --> 00:16:53,077
You okay?

441
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:55,129
Sure.

442
00:16:55,197 --> 00:16:57,297
I'm going to update
a patient's babysitter

443
00:16:57,366 --> 00:16:59,283
instead of doing surgery.

444
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:00,913
Because Torres and
Robbins don't need me.

445
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:02,269
They have each other.

446
00:17:02,338 --> 00:17:04,071
Are the two of you...

447
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:06,324
They're getting back together.

448
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:07,769
Were you really
into her or was it...

449
00:17:07,793 --> 00:17:09,159
I was really into her.

450
00:17:09,229 --> 00:17:11,612
Why do I do this?

451
00:17:11,681 --> 00:17:14,832
I can't keep falling apart at
work every time I get dumped.

452
00:17:14,901 --> 00:17:16,178
It's starting to
be all the time.

453
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:17,685
So get off the floor.

454
00:17:17,753 --> 00:17:20,621
Go talk to your
babysitter and get back

455
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:22,673
in the OR, like a
surgeon would do.

456
00:17:30,483 --> 00:17:31,682
Hey.

457
00:17:31,751 --> 00:17:33,584
Oh, my vascular graft...

458
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:35,130
Yeah, the one you printed? I
was gonna come and see it.

459
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:38,489
It had a glitch, so it'll
be tomorrow, hopefully.

460
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:40,608
Not today. Okay.

461
00:17:40,677 --> 00:17:43,711
Hey, you have
Thanksgiving plans?

462
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:46,998
Well, I'll probably pick up
an extra shift. You know?

463
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,044
I don't get all that worked
up about cranberries.

464
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,167
You?

465
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:52,136
Um...

466
00:17:52,205 --> 00:17:54,605
Well, uh, it's evolving.

467
00:17:57,009 --> 00:17:59,020
You can tell me you're
spending it with Emma.

468
00:17:59,044 --> 00:18:01,484
I won't melt if I hear her name.

469
00:18:01,948 --> 00:18:03,814
Yes. I'll be with Emma.

470
00:18:03,883 --> 00:18:05,950
She gonna cook? Mmm-hmm.

471
00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:08,068
Hmm. Well, watch out.

472
00:18:08,137 --> 00:18:10,115
You let her make a turkey
for just the two of you,

473
00:18:10,139 --> 00:18:12,685
you're gonna be eating
leftovers for the rest of your life.

474
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,196
Her femur was bleeding
very heavily into her thigh,

475
00:18:21,234 --> 00:18:23,434
and she was in danger
of losing too much blood.

476
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:24,701
Oh, my God.

477
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,148
They've taken her
back into the OR,

478
00:18:26,172 --> 00:18:27,482
and they're working
on her right now.

479
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:29,968
You told me it was
just a broken leg.

480
00:18:29,992 --> 00:18:31,792
A femur break
can be complicated,

481
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:33,610
but we're gonna take care of it.

482
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:35,940
Oh, my God, they
are gonna kill me.

483
00:18:35,964 --> 00:18:37,264
I'm sure that they won't.

484
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:39,478
I really liked them,
too. They work together.

485
00:18:39,502 --> 00:18:44,438
They're in Alaska, studying
the nesting habits of eagles.

486
00:18:44,507 --> 00:18:46,217
I cannot believe I'm
gonna lose this job.

487
00:18:46,241 --> 00:18:49,744
They're not gonna fire you. They'll
understand it wasn't your fault.

488
00:18:49,812 --> 00:18:52,780
Something terrible happened.
You have to blame somebody.

489
00:18:52,849 --> 00:18:55,950
What, are they gonna
blame their child?

490
00:18:56,018 --> 00:18:58,886
They're probably never
gonna let me see her again.

491
00:18:58,955 --> 00:19:02,389
I guess it's my fault
for getting so attached.

492
00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:05,075
Hey.

493
00:19:05,145 --> 00:19:06,222
Hey.

494
00:19:06,246 --> 00:19:08,312
Can I boot you out
of your OR at 4:00?

495
00:19:08,381 --> 00:19:10,092
Uh, the mastoidectomy
after this? Yeah.

496
00:19:10,116 --> 00:19:11,594
I need to put a gastro-j
on the schedule,

497
00:19:11,618 --> 00:19:14,818
and if I tell Grey she can't
get into the OR until 7:00,

498
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:16,298
she's gonna shove
her hand into my chest

499
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:17,972
and rip out my
heart with her claws.

500
00:19:18,057 --> 00:19:19,401
That means I have to work late.

501
00:19:19,425 --> 00:19:20,941
You'll be working late anyhow,

502
00:19:21,009 --> 00:19:23,761
because you're so committed
to the welfare of this hospital.

503
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:26,397
And to the people who
count on you for support.

504
00:19:26,466 --> 00:19:29,600
All right. All
right, I will take it.

505
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:31,269
Thank you. Mmm-hmm.

506
00:19:32,187 --> 00:19:33,887
And Kepner invited
me to her wedding.

507
00:19:35,158 --> 00:19:37,741
Did she? Plus one.

508
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:39,660
And you're gonna
be invited, plus one.

509
00:19:41,447 --> 00:19:43,380
Is she expecting us
to bring other people?

510
00:19:43,449 --> 00:19:47,201
No, brides are weird. Go think
about something else. Please?

511
00:19:47,803 --> 00:19:48,936
Okay.

512
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:00,898
Is he gonna make it?

513
00:20:00,967 --> 00:20:02,545
Well, if Yang can
get her act together.

514
00:20:02,569 --> 00:20:04,118
I keep diuresing him,

515
00:20:04,187 --> 00:20:05,864
but that's not gonna work
for much longer. Mmm.

516
00:20:05,888 --> 00:20:07,615
Hey, you're invited to
Mer's for Thanksgiving.

517
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:08,922
Really?

518
00:20:08,991 --> 00:20:10,652
I'm invited and,
uh, I'm bringing you.

519
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:12,321
The attendings are
gonna be weird if I'm there.

520
00:20:12,345 --> 00:20:13,455
No, they're not.

521
00:20:13,479 --> 00:20:14,907
Just go without me.
We'll meet up after.

522
00:20:14,931 --> 00:20:16,909
You think I wanna
be there if you're not?

523
00:20:16,933 --> 00:20:18,565
You're sweet.

524
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:20,267
Okay, screw it.

525
00:20:20,336 --> 00:20:21,713
How about we get takeout
chicken and eat it in the car

526
00:20:21,737 --> 00:20:22,898
like we were raised to do?

527
00:20:22,922 --> 00:20:24,154
I think I love you.

528
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,463
Yeah, yeah, settle down.

529
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:33,230
<i>Two more women
responded to the ad.</i>

530
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:35,580
One of them's gonna come
by in about half an hour.

531
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:37,818
Did she seem nice?

532
00:20:37,887 --> 00:20:38,967
Yeah.

533
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:43,757
I told Stan.

534
00:20:44,727 --> 00:20:47,995
What? Why?

535
00:20:48,064 --> 00:20:50,059
I couldn't let it go, and he...

536
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:52,516
Oh! He'll hate this.

537
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:54,385
It was supposed to seem natural,

538
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:56,169
like someone you'd
met at the pool.

539
00:20:56,238 --> 00:20:58,472
I can't lie to him.

540
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:00,569
We've always been honest.
That's how it's worked.

541
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:05,612
This isn't some big lie.
It's a kindness. You agreed.

542
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:07,064
Well, that was before...

543
00:21:07,133 --> 00:21:08,698
Before I was dying?

544
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:10,751
It matters more now, not less.

545
00:21:12,638 --> 00:21:15,133
So you're saying she performed
unnecessary procedures?

546
00:21:15,157 --> 00:21:16,474
I'm not saying anything.

547
00:21:16,526 --> 00:21:17,970
I was shooting the
breeze with a friend,

548
00:21:17,994 --> 00:21:19,421
I wasn't making a
report to the board.

549
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:20,610
I'm sorry.

550
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:22,273
Whatever. Let's
just reel it back in.

551
00:21:22,297 --> 00:21:24,849
You know he can't do
that, and I certainly can't.

552
00:21:24,901 --> 00:21:26,233
But she's gonna handle it.

553
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:27,634
That is not what you said.

554
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:29,981
You said you saw the Virgin
Mary in your toothpaste.

555
00:21:30,005 --> 00:21:31,116
We were talking.

556
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:32,383
I need to pull
her off the floor,

557
00:21:32,407 --> 00:21:33,602
at least until this
is under control.

558
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:34,786
She was gonna go...

559
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:36,443
I'm sorry.

560
00:21:36,512 --> 00:21:38,345
Can you let me talk to her?

561
00:21:40,149 --> 00:21:41,198
Yeah.

562
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,342
She seems nice, right?

563
00:21:52,411 --> 00:21:53,805
Oh, the woman? Yeah.

564
00:21:53,829 --> 00:21:55,746
Oh, I don't know.

565
00:21:58,017 --> 00:22:00,896
Okay, I tried to check
her out, but I just...

566
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,954
There wasn't a good enough
reason for me to stay in the room.

567
00:22:04,023 --> 00:22:07,391
It is strange.
There's no question.

568
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:09,727
My wife and I looking
for a female companion

569
00:22:09,795 --> 00:22:10,894
for her lover.

570
00:22:10,963 --> 00:22:12,641
Yeah, it's a first for me.

571
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:14,130
Eh, you're young.

572
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:19,770
Donna and I had a wonderful
marriage for 30 years.

573
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:22,406
And then the fire went away.

574
00:22:23,709 --> 00:22:26,644
And we both found other people.

575
00:22:26,712 --> 00:22:29,630
But she was still
my best friend.

576
00:22:29,699 --> 00:22:34,702
We somehow both hated the
idea of divorcing each other.

577
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:38,138
So now you're helping
her pick somebody for...

578
00:22:38,207 --> 00:22:39,647
Stan. Stan.

579
00:22:39,709 --> 00:22:42,576
He's never been in
love like this before.

580
00:22:42,645 --> 00:22:45,729
She's afraid he's
gonna be alone forever.

581
00:22:45,798 --> 00:22:47,614
He's a wonderful person.

582
00:22:47,683 --> 00:22:49,750
We played golf
together for years.

583
00:22:51,187 --> 00:22:53,170
I don't want to see
him alone, either.

584
00:22:59,812 --> 00:23:05,349
You told the chief of surgery
that I have a psychiatric condition?

585
00:23:05,418 --> 00:23:07,011
It was an accident.
Derek and I were talking...

586
00:23:07,035 --> 00:23:08,569
Where the hell do you get...

587
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:10,615
All we're talking
about is a few days.

588
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:13,323
Take a break! Figure
out how to manage this.

589
00:23:13,375 --> 00:23:15,626
Stay out of my...

590
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:17,211
Bench yourself.

591
00:23:18,481 --> 00:23:20,146
Or the chief will.

592
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:25,052
Miranda...

593
00:23:28,207 --> 00:23:30,385
You send your lackey
to tell my lackey?

594
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:32,387
You can't tell me to my face
you're destroying my study?

595
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:33,988
You know I'm not
destroying your study...

596
00:23:34,012 --> 00:23:35,957
If I don't finish this phase
by the end of this week,

597
00:23:35,981 --> 00:23:38,048
I lose my funding.

598
00:23:38,116 --> 00:23:39,583
Come with me.

599
00:23:42,354 --> 00:23:43,554
Please.

600
00:23:50,729 --> 00:23:53,330
That's Nathan. He's a real baby.

601
00:23:53,398 --> 00:23:55,883
We're not talking about
me. We're talking about him.

602
00:23:55,952 --> 00:23:59,086
That's Ashley, his mom.
He has a very nice father.

603
00:23:59,155 --> 00:24:02,217
This isn't a study,
Meredith. This is a baby.

604
00:24:02,241 --> 00:24:03,519
Nathan is the first
one in his family

605
00:24:03,543 --> 00:24:04,753
who's supposed to go to college.

606
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:05,854
I mean, he's a baby.

607
00:24:05,878 --> 00:24:07,077
Have you lost your mind?

608
00:24:07,146 --> 00:24:08,640
Do you think that
because I have kids,

609
00:24:08,664 --> 00:24:10,130
every time I see a child,

610
00:24:10,198 --> 00:24:12,310
I'm gonna start lactating
and lose my ability to reason?

611
00:24:12,334 --> 00:24:13,750
No.

612
00:24:13,819 --> 00:24:15,196
You wanted to do something
flashy with the equipment.

613
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:16,337
It didn't work.

614
00:24:16,405 --> 00:24:19,406
Now you want me to
shut down my entire study,

615
00:24:19,475 --> 00:24:21,074
so that you can run a Hail Mary

616
00:24:21,143 --> 00:24:24,261
that very well might
kill this very cute child.

617
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:26,708
Baby Nathan and all
of his college potential,

618
00:24:26,732 --> 00:24:27,776
can get an artificial graft...

619
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,844
No.

620
00:24:28,868 --> 00:24:31,418
Like every other HLHS baby.

621
00:24:31,487 --> 00:24:33,070
No, he can't.

622
00:24:33,139 --> 00:24:34,588
Because you can't make it work.

623
00:24:38,744 --> 00:24:40,371
How many people?
We might be up to 16.

624
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:43,230
But some of them are
kids, and they barely eat.

625
00:24:43,299 --> 00:24:44,826
I thought this was
dinner for four.

626
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:47,217
I know. I'm sorry. It just
kinda got out of hand.

627
00:24:47,286 --> 00:24:48,802
We can all just cook together.

628
00:24:48,871 --> 00:24:51,049
I thought Meredith doesn't
know how to turn on an oven.

629
00:24:51,073 --> 00:24:52,857
Well, the rest of us.

630
00:24:52,925 --> 00:24:54,519
I'll do all the shopping.
I'll do all the planning.

631
00:24:54,543 --> 00:24:57,410
I will do everything, and you
just get to shout out orders.

632
00:24:57,479 --> 00:24:58,924
Okay, it's starting
to sound better.

633
00:24:58,948 --> 00:25:00,597
Okay. Good.

634
00:25:04,102 --> 00:25:07,788
So maybe I should quit
while I'm ahead but, um...

635
00:25:07,873 --> 00:25:09,239
What?

636
00:25:09,308 --> 00:25:11,074
Cristina isn't...

637
00:25:11,143 --> 00:25:12,943
She doesn't have
Thanksgiving plans.

638
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:16,297
I mean, just as
a friend, I, uh...

639
00:25:16,365 --> 00:25:18,299
I shouldn't have said
anything. Just forget it.

640
00:25:18,367 --> 00:25:19,800
No, Owen. It's okay.

641
00:25:19,869 --> 00:25:22,069
If you say you're
over her, I believe you.

642
00:25:22,121 --> 00:25:23,732
And really, it's up to
Meredith and Derek

643
00:25:23,756 --> 00:25:25,789
'cause it's their house.

644
00:25:25,858 --> 00:25:27,724
Are you sure?

645
00:25:27,793 --> 00:25:30,344
I want you to be comfortable.

646
00:25:30,412 --> 00:25:32,223
Well, I'm gonna be
cooking for what could be,

647
00:25:32,247 --> 00:25:34,092
at the end of the
day, 30 people,

648
00:25:34,116 --> 00:25:36,612
so I won't have time
to be uncomfortable.

649
00:25:36,636 --> 00:25:38,368
Okay.

650
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:46,309
I'm gonna speak to
her about the stuffing.

651
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:48,612
You think she could
handle a deep-fried turkey?

652
00:25:48,681 --> 00:25:50,246
I mean, there's nothing like it.

653
00:25:50,315 --> 00:25:52,861
Don't people kill themselves
trying to make those?

654
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:54,629
Everything has a price.

655
00:25:54,653 --> 00:25:59,155
You guys, my patient
has a husband and a lover.

656
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:01,402
And she and the husband
are interviewing women

657
00:26:01,426 --> 00:26:03,405
for the lover to date
when she's dead.

658
00:26:03,429 --> 00:26:04,473
When the patient's dead?

659
00:26:04,497 --> 00:26:05,557
It's weird.

660
00:26:05,581 --> 00:26:06,758
Is that like a threesome thing?

661
00:26:06,782 --> 00:26:07,975
Dr. Webber...

662
00:26:07,999 --> 00:26:10,768
I'm just asking a question.

663
00:26:10,836 --> 00:26:12,136
You hiding from Grey again?

664
00:26:13,956 --> 00:26:16,196
On your way, Edwards.

665
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:21,523
I need you to take over
Bailey's surgical load today.

666
00:26:21,547 --> 00:26:23,647
I can't. My study
is falling apart,

667
00:26:23,699 --> 00:26:25,476
and I have a palliative
surgery later today.

668
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,549
Meredith.

669
00:26:31,323 --> 00:26:33,201
You ever done an
ex-fix before, Murphy?

670
00:26:33,225 --> 00:26:34,258
No.

671
00:26:34,994 --> 00:26:36,176
Hmm. Try it.

672
00:26:37,445 --> 00:26:39,780
Yeah. Right there.

673
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:41,743
Now, the first cortex is hard.

674
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:43,661
Then it'll feel
spongy in the middle,

675
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:45,925
and then hard again when
you hit the second cortex, okay?

676
00:26:47,156 --> 00:26:49,889
That's it. Really push through.

677
00:26:49,976 --> 00:26:51,386
Uh, okay. It feels spongy.

678
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:52,787
Okay, ease up a bit now.

679
00:26:52,811 --> 00:26:55,057
Now the pitch'll change
when you hit the cortex, okay?

680
00:26:55,081 --> 00:26:57,281
Can you hear it?

681
00:26:59,134 --> 00:27:01,535
Oh, my God.

682
00:27:01,603 --> 00:27:03,548
Okay, you drilled right
through her leg into the table.

683
00:27:03,572 --> 00:27:05,292
Oh, my God! No,
it's... Back it up.

684
00:27:05,357 --> 00:27:06,635
Just put the drill in reverse.

685
00:27:06,659 --> 00:27:08,269
I can't... Put the
drill in reverse!

686
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:09,392
I can't find the...

687
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:10,939
Can you just take it?
My hand is shaking.

688
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:12,507
Okay, all right. Pull it
together... Can you please just...

689
00:27:12,531 --> 00:27:14,359
Murphy, pull it together.

690
00:27:14,383 --> 00:27:16,366
Oh! Please! Murphy!

691
00:27:16,435 --> 00:27:18,552
Can you please do something?

692
00:27:20,456 --> 00:27:22,488
Callie, can you
take it yourself?

693
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:24,957
Just give her a few
minutes to calm down.

694
00:27:25,127 --> 00:27:26,310
Well...

695
00:27:35,104 --> 00:27:36,269
It was her?

696
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,640
Ten-plus times! That was her?

697
00:27:48,633 --> 00:27:52,035
That is just perfect.

698
00:28:00,912 --> 00:28:01,912
Why would you tell her?

699
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:03,112
I didn't.

700
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:05,382
I told her it was
someone. I didn't say who.

701
00:28:05,451 --> 00:28:06,695
I mean, listen,
she figured it out

702
00:28:06,719 --> 00:28:07,829
because you fell apart in there.

703
00:28:07,853 --> 00:28:09,264
You could've just
forgotten about it

704
00:28:09,288 --> 00:28:10,687
and gone on with
your happy life.

705
00:28:10,756 --> 00:28:13,001
This is my marriage
we're talking about.

706
00:28:13,025 --> 00:28:14,641
Yeah, and it's my career!

707
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:16,421
She hates me now.
No, she doesn't.

708
00:28:16,445 --> 00:28:18,111
Oh, please. Of course she does.

709
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:20,163
She can't blame
you. She loves you.

710
00:28:20,232 --> 00:28:22,099
The only one she
can blame is me.

711
00:28:25,955 --> 00:28:27,487
Hey.

712
00:28:27,556 --> 00:28:31,058
So you realize that Stephanie
and I are serious, right?

713
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:32,192
You get that?

714
00:28:32,261 --> 00:28:33,604
Yeah, yeah. Uh-huh. Great.

715
00:28:33,628 --> 00:28:35,807
I think it's nice
that you guys are...

716
00:28:35,831 --> 00:28:37,464
Whatever you are.

717
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:39,732
Right.

718
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:41,512
So why is it that you invited
her to your wedding, plus a guest,

719
00:28:41,536 --> 00:28:43,216
and you're gonna
invite me, plus a guest?

720
00:28:43,255 --> 00:28:45,022
What's going on?

721
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:47,635
Right, yeah. Um, I wanted
to talk to you about that.

722
00:28:47,659 --> 00:28:49,893
You are actually not
getting an invitation,

723
00:28:49,962 --> 00:28:53,541
but Stephanie is, so you
could just be her plus one.

724
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:55,164
Mmm-hmm.

725
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:57,379
Look, I put your
name on the invite list.

726
00:28:57,403 --> 00:29:00,014
Your name is Avery. We
don't know any other A's.

727
00:29:00,038 --> 00:29:01,783
You're literally
the top of the list,

728
00:29:01,807 --> 00:29:04,247
first thing we see
when we look at it.

729
00:29:04,843 --> 00:29:07,561
I didn't wanna rub
it in Matthew's face.

730
00:29:09,381 --> 00:29:12,282
If he has a problem with
my name on a piece of paper,

731
00:29:12,351 --> 00:29:14,568
why should I be at this wedding?

732
00:29:15,237 --> 00:29:16,414
Because of me.

733
00:29:16,438 --> 00:29:19,590
Because you're my friend
and I want you to be there.

734
00:29:21,127 --> 00:29:22,892
Yeah.

735
00:29:22,961 --> 00:29:25,462
Yeah, well, I wanna
be there, too, but...

736
00:29:26,499 --> 00:29:27,564
Come on.

737
00:29:29,701 --> 00:29:33,786
Jackson, I can't go through with
this if I don't have your blessing.

738
00:29:37,125 --> 00:29:41,194
Well, you have it. All right?

739
00:29:41,263 --> 00:29:43,863
But I don't think
I should be there.

740
00:29:48,037 --> 00:29:50,170
Dr. Grey was pulled into
an emergency surgery.

741
00:29:50,239 --> 00:29:53,306
So we are gonna have to push Mrs.
Kaufman's procedure to tomorrow.

742
00:29:53,375 --> 00:29:54,886
I... What is she doing?

743
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:57,210
I apologize. I'll be over here.

744
00:29:59,548 --> 00:30:02,365
You don't have to actually
date the woman she chooses.

745
00:30:02,434 --> 00:30:04,484
I don't wanna date any woman.

746
00:30:06,855 --> 00:30:09,173
That's why she's
doing this, Stan.

747
00:30:09,241 --> 00:30:10,952
I thought you were
gonna talk her out of it.

748
00:30:10,976 --> 00:30:13,087
You need to tell her yourself.
You're both putting me in the middle.

749
00:30:13,111 --> 00:30:15,028
Because she listens to you.

750
00:30:15,097 --> 00:30:17,097
She doesn't listen to anyone.

751
00:30:18,584 --> 00:30:22,719
Besides, this is not
such a terrible idea.

752
00:30:22,788 --> 00:30:25,321
I'm not a child she has
to arrange daycare for.

753
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:28,725
What, a bunch of women
she scared up on the internet?

754
00:30:28,793 --> 00:30:30,076
It's awful.

755
00:30:30,145 --> 00:30:33,279
It's taking her mind off
what's actually happening.

756
00:30:33,348 --> 00:30:35,026
That can't be the
worst thing in the world.

757
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:37,530
She thinks she can find
someone to replace her?

758
00:30:39,355 --> 00:30:42,673
You can't replace her.

759
00:30:47,046 --> 00:30:51,548
Nobody can possibly replace her.

760
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:55,185
Why?

761
00:30:55,254 --> 00:30:57,521
Why is this happening?

762
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:03,577
He's desatted to 60.

763
00:31:03,645 --> 00:31:05,979
If we're gonna do this
thing, we gotta do it now.

764
00:31:06,047 --> 00:31:07,826
I can't. I don't have a
conduit to put in him.

765
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:09,260
It won't be done for
another six hours.

766
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:10,829
I don't know if he's
gonna last that long.

767
00:31:10,853 --> 00:31:12,151
Okay.

768
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:14,198
Okay, let's put
him on an oscillator.

769
00:31:14,222 --> 00:31:16,133
It will stabilize his
sats for easily a day.

770
00:31:16,157 --> 00:31:17,368
I don't wanna wait
a day, Cristina.

771
00:31:17,392 --> 00:31:18,536
No, neither do I, Alex.

772
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:21,044
But in the long run,
it's still his best chance.

773
00:31:29,504 --> 00:31:30,704
Good.

774
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:40,725
Well, thanks to you, my
resident offered to service me.

775
00:31:40,749 --> 00:31:42,114
What?

776
00:31:42,183 --> 00:31:44,512
To drive me around the
block before my battery dies.

777
00:31:44,536 --> 00:31:46,336
Ah. You gonna do it?

778
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:49,645
Shane? No. It'll be like
having sex with a baby seal.

779
00:31:53,511 --> 00:31:54,594
Sats are better.

780
00:31:54,663 --> 00:31:55,903
Good.

781
00:31:58,150 --> 00:31:59,693
Why don't you talk to Meredith?

782
00:31:59,717 --> 00:32:01,296
Explain that everything
is gonna be fine.

783
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,530
Maybe she'll cut me some slack.

784
00:32:02,554 --> 00:32:04,032
She's got a point.
Which is what?

785
00:32:04,056 --> 00:32:05,576
You could put in
an artificial graft.

786
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,051
We tried. He rejected it.

787
00:32:07,075 --> 00:32:08,375
So try again.

788
00:32:08,443 --> 00:32:09,676
Pump him full of meds.

789
00:32:09,745 --> 00:32:11,021
Hold him over for a couple years

790
00:32:11,045 --> 00:32:12,590
until your brand-new
procedure's old news,

791
00:32:12,614 --> 00:32:13,654
tested hundreds of times.

792
00:32:13,699 --> 00:32:15,231
That's what I'd do.

793
00:32:15,301 --> 00:32:16,777
You wanna fight a different
battle, that's your own problem.

794
00:32:16,801 --> 00:32:20,136
You're right, Alex.
This is my problem.

795
00:32:22,857 --> 00:32:24,257
Your heart rate's pretty high.

796
00:32:24,326 --> 00:32:26,026
Keep going. I'm fine.

797
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:28,790
This is when we're
supposed to take it up a notch.

798
00:32:28,814 --> 00:32:30,413
But I'm not sure...

799
00:32:30,482 --> 00:32:32,015
Wilson, I'm gonna hurt you.

800
00:32:35,804 --> 00:32:37,115
Dr. Webber, I
don't think that we...

801
00:32:37,139 --> 00:32:38,488
No!

802
00:32:38,557 --> 00:32:40,190
Take it up again!

803
00:32:42,694 --> 00:32:43,944
Wilson!

804
00:32:51,186 --> 00:32:53,337
Oh, my God!

805
00:32:53,405 --> 00:32:55,839
I need some help
here! Dr. Shepherd!

806
00:32:55,907 --> 00:32:57,640
What happened?

807
00:33:14,243 --> 00:33:17,077
Dr. Bailey, could we
speak for a moment?

808
00:33:17,146 --> 00:33:18,823
Uh, I'm about to
get started here.

809
00:33:18,847 --> 00:33:20,458
Why don't I track you
down when I'm done?

810
00:33:20,482 --> 00:33:22,381
This is a conversation
we should have now.

811
00:33:22,451 --> 00:33:24,651
Dr. Grey can take over.

812
00:33:27,221 --> 00:33:28,621
Dr. Bailey...

813
00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:31,174
I will speak to you
when I am finished here.

814
00:33:39,033 --> 00:33:40,467
Do you mind?

815
00:33:41,903 --> 00:33:42,947
Dr. Grey,

816
00:33:42,971 --> 00:33:44,566
please move Dr. Bailey's bovie

817
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:45,734
one inch to the left.

818
00:33:45,758 --> 00:33:47,373
Oh, don't touch...

819
00:33:58,570 --> 00:33:59,836
Grey.

820
00:33:59,905 --> 00:34:02,672
And move the
suction one inch down.

821
00:34:02,741 --> 00:34:04,485
Get away from my...
Maybe even four...

822
00:34:04,509 --> 00:34:05,825
Get away from my table!

823
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:36,956
Bruising over the chest wall.

824
00:34:37,025 --> 00:34:38,469
I need a portable ultrasound.

825
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:40,004
I don't need an
ultrasound. My rib's broken.

826
00:34:40,028 --> 00:34:41,445
His pulse ox is low.

827
00:34:41,513 --> 00:34:42,757
What the hell happened?

828
00:34:42,781 --> 00:34:43,913
Please, don't.

829
00:34:43,982 --> 00:34:45,226
He fell off the
treadmill. What...

830
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:47,161
You're jogging now? Oh!

831
00:34:47,185 --> 00:34:48,245
Yeah. Rib's broken.

832
00:34:48,269 --> 00:34:49,920
Stress test. He
wanted out of here.

833
00:34:49,988 --> 00:34:51,828
All right, can we get a
portable X-ray in here?

834
00:34:54,693 --> 00:34:57,160
I'm Dr. Robbins. I'm so sorry.

835
00:35:03,951 --> 00:35:05,191
How you doing?

836
00:35:06,338 --> 00:35:08,304
I should probably go.

837
00:35:08,373 --> 00:35:12,391
I mean, I'm the last person
they wanna see right now.

838
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:15,728
I'm sure they're glad
to have you here.

839
00:35:15,797 --> 00:35:17,530
It's stupid, right?

840
00:35:18,633 --> 00:35:20,867
I mean, she's not even my kid.

841
00:35:23,338 --> 00:35:26,172
Maybe I could, uh, hang
out a little, you know?

842
00:35:26,241 --> 00:35:28,107
See if they need anything?

843
00:35:28,176 --> 00:35:29,526
I can wait with you.

844
00:35:29,594 --> 00:35:31,554
This is what the fracture
looked like initially.

845
00:35:31,596 --> 00:35:33,179
And this is how...

846
00:35:39,704 --> 00:35:42,672
What happened with Bailey? I
heard she got kicked out of her OR.

847
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:43,985
I can't get into that with you.

848
00:35:44,009 --> 00:35:45,842
Come on.

849
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:47,888
Oh, we don't have to
go to Kepner's wedding.

850
00:35:47,912 --> 00:35:49,757
I talked to her. We don't
have to worry about any of that.

851
00:35:49,781 --> 00:35:50,980
Why?

852
00:35:51,049 --> 00:35:52,289
It's just simpler.

853
00:35:55,103 --> 00:35:56,268
You know, um...

854
00:35:57,606 --> 00:36:00,206
My patient and her husband
are interviewing women

855
00:36:00,274 --> 00:36:03,076
to date her lover when she dies.

856
00:36:03,145 --> 00:36:05,612
They're all friends,

857
00:36:05,681 --> 00:36:08,161
and they're supporting each
other through this horrible time.

858
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:11,450
And when Stan
cries, Victor hugs him.

859
00:36:14,022 --> 00:36:17,206
That's what it looks like when
people are over each other.

860
00:36:17,275 --> 00:36:19,470
You think I should
be hugging Matthew?

861
00:36:19,494 --> 00:36:21,227
Why aren't we
going to the wedding?

862
00:36:21,295 --> 00:36:23,373
Because my name starts with "A".

863
00:36:23,397 --> 00:36:24,637
Because April is neurotic.

864
00:36:24,666 --> 00:36:25,977
Because Matthew
and I do not hug,

865
00:36:26,001 --> 00:36:27,612
and no, it's not
gonna be comfortable.

866
00:36:27,636 --> 00:36:30,431
It's awkward, frankly. It's
probably gonna be awkward forever.

867
00:36:30,455 --> 00:36:32,633
But that does not mean
that it is not over between us

868
00:36:32,657 --> 00:36:34,924
because it is.

869
00:36:34,993 --> 00:36:38,011
It's important to me
that you believe that.

870
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:41,364
'Cause if you don't, I
could really ruin our night.

871
00:36:42,834 --> 00:36:45,284
I have some really nice
ideas about our night.

872
00:36:58,533 --> 00:37:01,818
Okay, you've had a day. Day's
over. I need you to clear out.

873
00:37:01,887 --> 00:37:03,030
We need some more time.

874
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:05,054
You have had more time!

875
00:37:05,123 --> 00:37:07,923
I need to get started printing
my portal vein by tonight or...

876
00:37:07,992 --> 00:37:09,403
We're having trouble
with the vacuum seeding.

877
00:37:09,427 --> 00:37:11,222
And we need to print
out another conduit.

878
00:37:11,246 --> 00:37:12,879
Again? Yes.

879
00:37:12,948 --> 00:37:15,759
We started a new one, and
it should be done by 3:00 am.

880
00:37:15,783 --> 00:37:18,101
I mean, Cristina,
no. It's not working.

881
00:37:18,169 --> 00:37:20,770
You are not Christ
child reincarnate.

882
00:37:20,838 --> 00:37:22,488
You don't walk on water.

883
00:37:22,557 --> 00:37:26,059
You have failed to
revolutionize modern medicine

884
00:37:26,128 --> 00:37:27,128
and save a baby

885
00:37:27,195 --> 00:37:28,661
all in one fell swoop.

886
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:31,497
And you are endangering
a child's life while you...

887
00:37:31,566 --> 00:37:32,748
Stop!

888
00:37:34,852 --> 00:37:35,902
Excuse me...

889
00:37:35,971 --> 00:37:37,219
That's enough.

890
00:37:37,288 --> 00:37:38,521
Ross, take a walk.

891
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:41,374
She wasn't gonna do
this. Because of you.

892
00:37:41,443 --> 00:37:42,620
I practically had
to force her into it.

893
00:37:42,644 --> 00:37:43,787
Ross, just...

894
00:37:43,811 --> 00:37:45,823
Because she cares about you.

895
00:37:45,847 --> 00:37:49,482
Oh, somebody's got
the hero worship down!

896
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:51,162
No, you've made this emotional.

897
00:37:51,186 --> 00:37:52,763
You made it about
your friendship.

898
00:37:52,787 --> 00:37:53,948
If it was about the work,

899
00:37:53,972 --> 00:37:55,115
you would've gone
to the chief of surgery,

900
00:37:55,139 --> 00:37:56,739
but you know what
he would've said.

901
00:37:56,808 --> 00:37:59,608
You'll get the printer
tomorrow, Dr. Grey.

902
00:38:16,427 --> 00:38:18,644
I'm sorry if that
was out of line.

903
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:21,364
I just couldn't listen to
her go after you like that.

904
00:38:28,289 --> 00:38:30,322
Hey, you just about ready?

905
00:38:30,392 --> 00:38:32,202
I was gonna check on
our patient before I left,

906
00:38:32,226 --> 00:38:33,871
but maybe you should make
sure Leah's not near the room.

907
00:38:33,895 --> 00:38:35,639
I don't wanna make her
cry. She's not gonna...

908
00:38:35,663 --> 00:38:37,475
Look, I think that the next time

909
00:38:37,499 --> 00:38:39,276
you exercise your
right to play around

910
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,833
when we're taking a break,

911
00:38:40,902 --> 00:38:42,312
I'm gonna ask you to
keep it out of the hospital.

912
00:38:42,336 --> 00:38:45,838
Not that it isn't fun, all
the drama in the OR...

913
00:38:45,907 --> 00:38:47,540
I realize that you're hurt,

914
00:38:47,609 --> 00:38:48,786
but when we got back together,

915
00:38:48,810 --> 00:38:50,454
we got back together
based on the assumption

916
00:38:50,478 --> 00:38:54,981
that we both made mistakes
and we were ready to start fresh.

917
00:38:55,050 --> 00:38:58,717
I can't keep apologizing. And
you can't keep playing a victim.

918
00:38:58,787 --> 00:39:00,219
If you want me back, I'm back,

919
00:39:00,288 --> 00:39:01,968
but I'm not here to
be your whipping boy.

920
00:39:04,426 --> 00:39:06,843
I've been sleeping on
the couch for a week.

921
00:39:06,912 --> 00:39:10,663
If I'm back, I sleep in the bed.

922
00:39:10,732 --> 00:39:16,102
Uh, okay. I get a night
to just digest this all.

923
00:39:16,171 --> 00:39:18,904
And then fine, you
can sleep in the bed.

924
00:39:19,941 --> 00:39:21,157
That's enthusiastic.

925
00:39:21,226 --> 00:39:22,341
Arizona...

926
00:39:24,629 --> 00:39:25,728
Fine.

927
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:35,805
If you spent half
the time working

928
00:39:35,874 --> 00:39:38,424
that you do having
girl talk with Shepherd,

929
00:39:38,492 --> 00:39:40,292
we wouldn't be in this mess.

930
00:39:40,379 --> 00:39:42,545
Yeah, 100% my fault.

931
00:39:42,614 --> 00:39:44,347
Just stay out of my career!

932
00:39:44,416 --> 00:39:46,394
I made one mistake. Oh,
one? Because I can think...

933
00:39:46,418 --> 00:39:47,744
I waited for Derek
to push me into it.

934
00:39:47,768 --> 00:39:49,346
I should've gone to
Owen Hunt myself,

935
00:39:49,370 --> 00:39:51,770
and I should've
done it days ago.

936
00:40:15,497 --> 00:40:17,262
I should've stopped the test.

937
00:40:17,331 --> 00:40:19,042
He's a hard guy to say no to.

938
00:40:19,066 --> 00:40:20,967
Yeah, but it's sort of my job.

939
00:40:21,035 --> 00:40:24,637
He couldn't do the stress test.
He wasn't ready to go home.

940
00:40:24,706 --> 00:40:26,772
You should go to
Dr. Grey's for Thanksgiving.

941
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:28,385
Me and these guys are gonna
hang out with Dr. Webber.

942
00:40:28,409 --> 00:40:30,142
Is that okay?

943
00:40:30,211 --> 00:40:32,523
Oh, you're blowing me off for
some old guy in a hospital bed?

944
00:40:32,547 --> 00:40:35,731
I'm sitting at the kids
table. I like the kids table.

945
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:36,994
You meet me after?

946
00:40:37,018 --> 00:40:38,084
Booty call.

947
00:40:40,354 --> 00:40:41,587
Mmm.

948
00:40:42,641 --> 00:40:44,507
Well, we can do a potluck.

949
00:40:44,576 --> 00:40:46,520
What exactly are you gonna cook?

950
00:40:46,544 --> 00:40:48,544
I could probably
handle a turkey.

951
00:40:48,613 --> 00:40:50,591
You think they're gonna
give you six hours off

952
00:40:50,615 --> 00:40:51,880
to baste a turkey?

953
00:40:51,933 --> 00:40:53,632
It takes six hours?

954
00:40:53,702 --> 00:40:55,001
You're not making a turkey.

955
00:40:55,069 --> 00:40:57,403
What about fried chicken?
From the Colonel's?

956
00:40:57,471 --> 00:40:58,599
You said that you
liked fried turkey.

957
00:40:58,623 --> 00:41:00,056
The bucket lacks dignity.

958
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:01,507
It's family style.

959
00:41:01,576 --> 00:41:03,509
They do make a
nice mashed potato.

960
00:41:03,578 --> 00:41:05,355
All right, I'm
gonna make a list.

961
00:41:05,379 --> 00:41:07,397
Uh, biscuits. Gravy.

962
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:08,576
Coleslaw. How many pieces?

963
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:09,949
Yes, and the gravy.

964
00:41:10,018 --> 00:41:12,351
My best friend's a mean
girl. Why did I choose that?

965
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:13,852
I don't know.

966
00:41:13,922 --> 00:41:15,599
It never bothered me when
she was mean to other people.

967
00:41:15,623 --> 00:41:18,842
But it really sucks
when she's mean to me.

968
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:20,826
Well, is she mean or is she...

969
00:41:21,263 --> 00:41:22,428
What?

970
00:41:22,497 --> 00:41:24,063
Nothing.

971
00:41:24,132 --> 00:41:27,144
Oh, Meredith. You can
invite Cristina if you want.

972
00:41:27,168 --> 00:41:28,518
You know, Thanksgiving.

973
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:29,947
I checked with Emma.
She's fine with it.

974
00:41:29,971 --> 00:41:31,787
Well, I'm glad
she's fine with it.

975
00:41:33,174 --> 00:41:34,274
Hi.

976
00:41:43,735 --> 00:41:44,975
Uh...

977
00:41:47,322 --> 00:41:48,688
<i>It's just a cold.</i>

978
00:41:51,092 --> 00:41:52,892
<i>Muscle through it.</i>

979
00:41:52,961 --> 00:41:54,577
I'm gonna go pick up the kids.

980
00:41:57,599 --> 00:41:59,048
<i>It'll pass.</i>

981
00:42:00,502 --> 00:42:02,402
<i>Nothing's really wrong.</i>

982
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:06,438
<i>We're doctors.</i>

983
00:42:07,675 --> 00:42:10,076
<i>We'd know if
something was wrong.</i>

984
00:42:11,279 --> 00:42:12,778
<i>We'll be fine.</i>

985
00:42:17,685 --> 00:42:18,817
<i>Nothing's wrong.</i>
