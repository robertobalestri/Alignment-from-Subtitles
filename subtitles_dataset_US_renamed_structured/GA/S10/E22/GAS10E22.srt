1
00:00:02,903 --> 00:00:05,837
<i>Sometimes, you just
need to get out of town,</i>

2
00:00:05,906 --> 00:00:08,073
<i>get a new perspective.</i>

3
00:00:08,142 --> 00:00:10,387
<i>But you can't always see that
you need a new perspective</i>

4
00:00:10,411 --> 00:00:13,645
<i>because you, well,
need a new perspective</i>

5
00:00:13,714 --> 00:00:15,014
<i>to be able to see that.</i>

6
00:00:15,082 --> 00:00:16,226
Hey, Cleveland
Clinic wants to know

7
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:17,444
if you can come
present your paper there.

8
00:00:17,468 --> 00:00:19,012
<i>It's complicated.</i> Why?

9
00:00:19,036 --> 00:00:21,114
'Cause the guy who won
the Harper Avery's too busy?

10
00:00:21,138 --> 00:00:23,182
This loss does not
define you. Well, good.

11
00:00:23,206 --> 00:00:25,585
So then stop trying to get me
to go somewhere to get over it.

12
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:27,476
And Zurich's been
calling three times a day,

13
00:00:27,545 --> 00:00:28,622
wanting you to
present there, too.

14
00:00:28,646 --> 00:00:30,256
Owen... This past year has been

15
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,641
all about the conduit trial.

16
00:00:31,665 --> 00:00:34,199
Let yourself be flown
first-class to the Alps

17
00:00:34,268 --> 00:00:35,834
and take the time to figure out

18
00:00:35,903 --> 00:00:36,980
what it is you want to do next.

19
00:00:37,004 --> 00:00:38,881
I know what I want to do next.

20
00:00:38,905 --> 00:00:41,225
Get this board
meeting over with.

21
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:45,677
Okay, that's everybody.
Shut the door.

22
00:00:45,745 --> 00:00:47,123
Well, wait. Where's Avery?

23
00:00:47,147 --> 00:00:49,731
We can get started without him.

24
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,468
I asked Hunt to share
some news with you.

25
00:00:52,536 --> 00:00:54,331
Dr. Russell spoke
with me yesterday.

26
00:00:54,355 --> 00:00:55,595
He's leaving the hospital.

27
00:00:55,655 --> 00:00:56,655
My boss Russell?

28
00:00:56,707 --> 00:00:58,089
He assured me four times

29
00:00:58,158 --> 00:01:01,093
that it had nothing to do with
this Harper Avery situation.

30
00:01:01,161 --> 00:01:02,856
Which means it
has everything to do

31
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,591
with this Harper
Avery situation.

32
00:01:04,615 --> 00:01:06,426
I'm sorry, am I missing
something? What situation?

33
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:09,384
No one from this hospital
will ever win a Harper Avery.

34
00:01:09,453 --> 00:01:12,404
Catherine Avery
told that to Richard.

35
00:01:12,473 --> 00:01:15,107
Richard thinks we should appeal.

36
00:01:15,176 --> 00:01:17,526
You mean I should appeal
and humiliate myself further?

37
00:01:17,595 --> 00:01:19,327
This is not about you, Yang.

38
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:21,773
This is about the hospital
being able to get money

39
00:01:21,832 --> 00:01:23,865
for research and to
attract more surgeons.

40
00:01:23,934 --> 00:01:25,511
We're already losing top talent.

41
00:01:25,535 --> 00:01:27,986
Uh, Russell's a loss,
but he's no Cristina Yang.

42
00:01:28,054 --> 00:01:29,800
Yeah, but Cristina Yang
can't be Cristina Yang

43
00:01:29,824 --> 00:01:31,272
if we lose funding.

44
00:01:31,342 --> 00:01:33,742
The NIH funds winners,
people with track records.

45
00:01:33,811 --> 00:01:35,827
People with Harper Averys.

46
00:01:35,895 --> 00:01:38,775
Appealing the decision is
not the worst idea in the world.

47
00:01:39,633 --> 00:01:41,049
What do you think, Yang?

48
00:01:41,117 --> 00:01:42,157
You in?

49
00:01:46,056 --> 00:01:47,121
Let me go.

50
00:01:52,029 --> 00:01:53,612
I hate this, Mer.

51
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,992
I just want one day where I'm
not reminded of the Harper Avery.

52
00:01:56,016 --> 00:01:58,700
And now the hospital's
in danger of losing grants?

53
00:01:58,769 --> 00:02:01,937
How is being nominated for this
award going to cost me grants?

54
00:02:02,005 --> 00:02:03,288
Did everyone forget

55
00:02:03,357 --> 00:02:05,540
that I put a printed conduit
in a kid and it worked?

56
00:02:05,609 --> 00:02:07,554
A bunch of guys in
Zurich didn't forget.

57
00:02:07,578 --> 00:02:09,622
They want you to
come and speak about it.

58
00:02:09,646 --> 00:02:11,145
It's a free trip.

59
00:02:11,215 --> 00:02:13,844
I mean, an hour of talking
for five days in the Swiss Alps?

60
00:02:13,868 --> 00:02:15,033
I'm not running away.

61
00:02:15,102 --> 00:02:16,234
I know that.

62
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:17,446
Yeah, but that's what
everyone's gonna think.

63
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,053
No, they don't.

64
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:22,474
Everyone here is angry for
you. Everyone supports you.

65
00:02:22,543 --> 00:02:24,309
Okay, can we just
stop for a minute

66
00:02:24,378 --> 00:02:27,178
about how the hospital
is one big, happy family?

67
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:28,780
It's a business. I get it.

68
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:31,650
Catherine Avery made
a business decision.

69
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:33,496
I've moved on.

70
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,188
Everyone else should, too.

71
00:02:36,257 --> 00:02:39,107
And... There you go.

72
00:02:39,877 --> 00:02:41,510
See right there?

73
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:44,846
That little blueberry's what
you've been waiting for.

74
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:46,615
Or not.

75
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:49,645
This wasn't the idea?

76
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:52,104
Uh. Well, sure.

77
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,334
Are you looking to terminate?

78
00:02:54,358 --> 00:02:56,041
God, no, no. No, no.

79
00:02:56,093 --> 00:02:57,392
Okay, then.

80
00:02:57,461 --> 00:03:00,395
Well, get dressed and
meet me in my office.

81
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:07,869
You don't want to
terminate, do you?

82
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:09,304
No.

83
00:03:10,474 --> 00:03:13,074
I want us to be
happy about this.

84
00:03:15,145 --> 00:03:16,445
I am happy.

85
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:19,992
The Coopers chose
to do their surgery here

86
00:03:20,016 --> 00:03:21,394
because we've
done so many of them

87
00:03:21,418 --> 00:03:22,629
that we're getting good at it.

88
00:03:22,653 --> 00:03:23,763
This one is a little bit tricky

89
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:25,907
because it involves the brain.

90
00:03:27,023 --> 00:03:28,885
Are you ready for
this? Third time, yeah.

91
00:03:28,909 --> 00:03:30,487
I'm just saying, this
is a very big surgery.

92
00:03:30,511 --> 00:03:31,860
Derek, you asked me to do it.

93
00:03:31,928 --> 00:03:33,356
If you're having second
thoughts about me, just...

94
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,957
It's too late for
that now, isn't it?

95
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:37,515
You must be Annie and Liz.

96
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:39,050
Nothing gets past you, huh?

97
00:03:39,119 --> 00:03:40,719
Be nice. I am.

98
00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:42,699
It's just unlikely he's gonna
confuse us with another patient.

99
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:43,866
Dr. Kenzie?

100
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,335
Yes. The girls' pediatrician.

101
00:03:45,359 --> 00:03:47,571
But, for the record, we're 25,
and he's no longer our doctor.

102
00:03:47,595 --> 00:03:48,995
He's more like our... Groupie.

103
00:03:49,046 --> 00:03:50,412
I was gonna say family.

104
00:03:50,481 --> 00:03:51,925
Our mom died a few years ago,

105
00:03:51,949 --> 00:03:53,259
and since then,
he's really been...

106
00:03:53,283 --> 00:03:54,465
There for us.

107
00:03:54,534 --> 00:03:55,861
Well, it's nice to
finally meet you.

108
00:03:55,885 --> 00:03:58,136
I'm Dr. Shepherd. And so am I.

109
00:03:58,204 --> 00:03:59,704
His sister.

110
00:03:59,773 --> 00:04:01,251
Good-looking doctors
run in the family.

111
00:04:01,275 --> 00:04:03,975
And these are some
of the roughly 40 people

112
00:04:04,043 --> 00:04:05,410
who will be working on you.

113
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:07,123
I'm not gonna ask you
to learn their names.

114
00:04:07,147 --> 00:04:08,346
Maybe you should.

115
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:10,815
We could take a test,
before and after surgery.

116
00:04:10,884 --> 00:04:12,562
See if you cut through
our memory centers.

117
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:13,796
Will you stop saying
things like that?

118
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,053
I'm just keeping it real.

119
00:04:15,122 --> 00:04:16,642
Oh, you're impossible.

120
00:04:18,392 --> 00:04:21,326
Oh, I am so late.

121
00:04:21,395 --> 00:04:22,494
This has got to stop.

122
00:04:22,563 --> 00:04:24,241
We can't stay up until
3:00 in the morning,

123
00:04:24,265 --> 00:04:26,197
talking about how much
you love your new job.

124
00:04:26,267 --> 00:04:27,910
Well, that's not
all we were doing.

125
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,270
I miss having you here.

126
00:04:31,338 --> 00:04:33,216
You can always call
me if you need help.

127
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,773
That's not why I miss you.
And why would I need help?

128
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:37,454
I'm not saying you
do. I'm saying if you do.

129
00:04:37,478 --> 00:04:39,978
I am perfectly capable of
making medical decisions

130
00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:41,357
without the help
of my boyfriend.

131
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:42,681
Dude, you're being weird.

132
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,844
Get out of the car
before you escalate.

133
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:48,103
These are the most complex
brain scans you will ever see.

134
00:04:48,171 --> 00:04:50,471
As you will see, these
women share brain matter.

135
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,852
Separating them is made even
more complicated by the fact...

136
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:54,687
There is one
shared sagittal sinus

137
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:56,589
supplying blood to the brain.

138
00:04:56,613 --> 00:04:58,813
First, we need to
determine which lucky twin

139
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:01,845
gets to keep that, and
the other twin gets a graft.

140
00:05:01,869 --> 00:05:03,167
Dr. Grey and Dr. Webber...

141
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:04,970
Will harvest the saphenous vein.

142
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:07,305
Which will be used as
the new sagittal sinus.

143
00:05:07,374 --> 00:05:08,974
Meanwhile, Dr. Torres will...

144
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:10,720
Be making a mold of
the cranial bone flap,

145
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:11,954
so then we'll be able to replace

146
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,298
the missing part of the skull...

147
00:05:13,363 --> 00:05:15,608
Which we will cover
with a flap for now.

148
00:05:15,632 --> 00:05:17,760
But I'll place skin expanders

149
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:19,829
so we're able to fully
cover the entire defect.

150
00:05:19,853 --> 00:05:21,813
We need to move
quickly and meticulously

151
00:05:21,855 --> 00:05:24,584
to turn one brain into two
with the least amount of deficit.

152
00:05:24,608 --> 00:05:26,391
If this surgery scares you,

153
00:05:26,443 --> 00:05:29,627
if you're not up to the
challenge, let me know.

154
00:05:29,697 --> 00:05:32,130
I need everybody
confident in there.

155
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:36,668
Get ready.

156
00:05:38,205 --> 00:05:39,905
Oh...

157
00:05:39,973 --> 00:05:42,052
Hey, I'm on Dr. Bailey's
service today, and...

158
00:05:42,076 --> 00:05:43,541
Dr. Bailey's avoiding us.

159
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:46,578
Uh, we wouldn't let
her put HIV into our son.

160
00:05:46,647 --> 00:05:48,241
It's replacing an
enzyme. It's not...

161
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:49,581
Oh, we know.

162
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:52,100
But we stuck to our
guns, and now look at him.

163
00:05:52,186 --> 00:05:54,636
Um, his numbers are fantastic,

164
00:05:54,705 --> 00:05:57,450
so I'll see if Dr. Bailey wants
to graduate him to solid food.

165
00:05:57,474 --> 00:05:59,240
Oh, and tell her
we're not mad at her.

166
00:05:59,309 --> 00:06:00,641
Oh, we're a little mad.

167
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:03,395
We're just thrilled that
Braden's doing so well.

168
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:04,503
Okay.

169
00:06:09,385 --> 00:06:10,425
Sabine?

170
00:06:16,276 --> 00:06:17,842
This was Frankie's pillow.

171
00:06:18,945 --> 00:06:21,412
I just bit the head
off of an orderly

172
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:22,859
who tried to take
the pillowcase.

173
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:25,361
I should... I should
probably go and apologize.

174
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:28,002
Don't worry about it.
Don't worry about it.

175
00:06:28,071 --> 00:06:29,788
But he's been so good to me.

176
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,572
He came to Frankie's funeral,

177
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:34,275
and he's been taking
care of my family.

178
00:06:36,179 --> 00:06:38,196
I'm discharging you.

179
00:06:38,265 --> 00:06:39,931
What? All of you.

180
00:06:41,668 --> 00:06:43,079
Link is on the transplant list.

181
00:06:43,103 --> 00:06:45,048
He can wait for a heart at home.

182
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:46,354
And Ivy is stable.

183
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,917
She should recover
in her own bedroom,

184
00:06:47,941 --> 00:06:49,352
with her stuff and her friends.

185
00:06:52,646 --> 00:06:54,178
We can go home?

186
00:06:57,684 --> 00:06:59,651
We can go home.

187
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:03,955
You suffered an
unimaginable loss,

188
00:07:04,023 --> 00:07:08,993
and you have two kids who
are alive and getting better.

189
00:07:09,062 --> 00:07:13,731
Your family needs to heal,
and you can't do that here.

190
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:20,783
All right. That's
one ticket, round trip.

191
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:22,840
And your destination is?

192
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:24,909
Zurich. Zurich it is.

193
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:38,100
<i>You've reached the voicemail</i>

194
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:40,392
<i>of Dr. Meredith Grey.
Please leave a message.</i>

195
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,227
Hey, you're probably
asleep or something.

196
00:07:43,297 --> 00:07:45,263
I have no idea
what time it is there.

197
00:07:45,332 --> 00:07:47,465
I barely know what day it is.

198
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:53,371
I love Zurich!

199
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,907
Well, what I've seen of
it, which is my hotel room.

200
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:59,477
But, Meredith, it is huge!

201
00:08:00,747 --> 00:08:05,016
This bed is like a
giant's bed or something,

202
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:09,187
if a giant were rich and
liked weird-shaped pillows.

203
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:11,572
I have slept for
24 hours, literally.

204
00:08:11,641 --> 00:08:14,408
<i>And I have to give my
talk, which is in a few hours,</i>

205
00:08:14,477 --> 00:08:16,488
<i>and then I'm flying back.</i> So
you can't get my chocolate.

206
00:08:16,512 --> 00:08:18,624
<i>So I don't think I'm gonna
have time to get you your stuff.</i>

207
00:08:18,648 --> 00:08:19,759
Why can't you just
get it at the airport?

208
00:08:19,783 --> 00:08:20,882
<i>Wait, you know what?</i>

209
00:08:20,951 --> 00:08:23,118
<i>Maybe I can just grab
something at the airport.</i>

210
00:08:23,186 --> 00:08:24,230
Good morning. Good morning.

211
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:26,031
Ultrasound's ready. Okay.

212
00:08:26,055 --> 00:08:29,695
We're gonna see which
saphenous vein to harvest.

213
00:08:30,444 --> 00:08:32,143
Ooh, that's so cold.

214
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:33,511
Oh!

215
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:34,723
Wait. How did you...

216
00:08:34,747 --> 00:08:36,425
We share some of
the sensory cortex.

217
00:08:36,449 --> 00:08:40,385
When they were little, I'd give
Annie a shot, and Lizzie would cry.

218
00:08:40,453 --> 00:08:42,866
The whole office would come in
and watch us do our party trick.

219
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:45,156
It's gonna be so weird
not having an audience

220
00:08:45,225 --> 00:08:46,225
for everything we do.

221
00:08:46,293 --> 00:08:47,859
Good weird, Annie.

222
00:08:47,928 --> 00:08:51,229
I know. It's just I don't know
how to do anything without you.

223
00:08:51,298 --> 00:08:53,798
I mean, I walk
by leaning on you.

224
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:55,778
I don't drive, because
you're on the driver's side.

225
00:08:55,802 --> 00:08:57,430
And at work, when a
client gets obnoxious,

226
00:08:57,454 --> 00:08:59,020
I let you yell at them.

227
00:08:59,089 --> 00:09:00,766
Well, I'll still yell at people
for you and drive you to work,

228
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,519
but you're gonna have to
learn to walk on your own,

229
00:09:02,543 --> 00:09:04,053
or that's just gonna be weird.

230
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:05,188
Stop making everything a joke.

231
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:07,045
Stop thinking
about mom. I'm not.

232
00:09:07,114 --> 00:09:09,714
Dude, we share a brain.

233
00:09:09,783 --> 00:09:11,910
She just always said it was
too dangerous to separate us.

234
00:09:11,934 --> 00:09:13,618
Your situation has
changed, Annie.

235
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:16,704
I think even your mother would
see how necessary it is now.

236
00:09:16,773 --> 00:09:18,417
Your blood supplies overlap.

237
00:09:18,441 --> 00:09:20,553
Liz's heart is doing
more work than yours,

238
00:09:20,577 --> 00:09:23,161
which is causing
high-output cardiac failure.

239
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,646
Your bodies can't
sustain this much longer.

240
00:09:25,715 --> 00:09:28,995
Meaning if we don't do
anything, we both die.

241
00:09:29,419 --> 00:09:30,830
I'm gonna do the stupid surgery.

242
00:09:30,854 --> 00:09:32,988
Don't get all weepy, Kenzie.

243
00:09:37,127 --> 00:09:39,394
Dr. Bailey.

244
00:09:39,463 --> 00:09:41,896
Braden Morris' parents think
that you're avoiding them.

245
00:09:41,965 --> 00:09:43,076
I'm not avoiding them.

246
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,500
Yeah, well, they
want to make sure

247
00:09:44,568 --> 00:09:45,645
that you know that
they're not mad at you.

248
00:09:45,669 --> 00:09:47,635
Imagine my relief.

249
00:09:47,704 --> 00:09:51,339
They're thrilled, because
Braden's doing great.

250
00:09:51,408 --> 00:09:53,675
He's got 500 T cells.

251
00:09:53,743 --> 00:09:55,821
It's a miracle. Can
he have solid food?

252
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:58,079
He can have whatever he wants.

253
00:09:58,147 --> 00:10:00,226
Um, monitor his
vitals every two hours

254
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:01,494
and get a full set
of labs again in four.

255
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:02,616
Okay.

256
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:04,480
Wilson, I have
back-to-back patients,

257
00:10:04,504 --> 00:10:07,183
and Babs Martin, my colectomy
patient, needs a central line.

258
00:10:07,207 --> 00:10:09,035
She has no peripheral
access. Got it. I'll do it now.

259
00:10:09,059 --> 00:10:10,203
Good. Oh, no you won't.

260
00:10:10,227 --> 00:10:12,327
3922 needs her JP drain removed,

261
00:10:12,395 --> 00:10:15,230
and the delightful but
demon-like little girl next door

262
00:10:15,298 --> 00:10:16,848
also needs a new feeding tube.

263
00:10:16,917 --> 00:10:18,733
And they're kids,
little, tiny humans,

264
00:10:18,802 --> 00:10:20,335
and we don't make
little, tiny humans

265
00:10:20,403 --> 00:10:22,749
wait for things like feeding
tubes and drain removals, do we?

266
00:10:22,773 --> 00:10:24,388
No, we don't.

267
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,223
Thanks. You're awesome.

268
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:28,654
Okay, I will take
care of twin A.

269
00:10:28,678 --> 00:10:30,244
Amy will take care of twin B

270
00:10:30,313 --> 00:10:31,557
Dr. Shepherd. What?

271
00:10:31,581 --> 00:10:34,281
No, I mean my
name is Dr. Shepherd.

272
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:37,385
You said Amy, and that makes
me sound like some sorority girl

273
00:10:37,454 --> 00:10:38,698
tagging along on
your brain surgery,

274
00:10:38,722 --> 00:10:41,088
when, in fact, I am
your co-surgeon.

275
00:10:42,175 --> 00:10:43,375
Okay, I apologize.

276
00:10:44,911 --> 00:10:46,105
Everybody clear on
their role? Torres?

277
00:10:46,129 --> 00:10:47,206
Yeah, I'm good. Avery?

278
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:48,230
Yeah, me too.

279
00:10:48,298 --> 00:10:49,930
Amy... Dr. Shepherd?

280
00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:52,217
I'm ready.

281
00:10:52,285 --> 00:10:54,886
All right. See
everybody in surgery.

282
00:10:54,954 --> 00:10:57,550
Get some food, people. This is the
last time you'll be eating for a while.

283
00:10:57,574 --> 00:10:58,768
Amy, let's go over
this one more time.

284
00:10:58,792 --> 00:11:00,141
All right.

285
00:11:00,209 --> 00:11:02,288
Mer, would you grab
me an energy bar?

286
00:11:02,312 --> 00:11:03,361
Yeah.

287
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:05,730
You know, he
thinks you're great,

288
00:11:05,798 --> 00:11:07,426
so I don't know why
he treats you like...

289
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:09,316
I'm incompetent.

290
00:11:09,385 --> 00:11:10,601
Because he's twin A.

291
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,148
Always has been, always will be.

292
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:15,589
Which makes me
twin B. Super fun.

293
00:11:15,658 --> 00:11:17,203
Hey, Raynbow
Williams in bed three

294
00:11:17,227 --> 00:11:20,161
needs an abdominal exam
to rule out appendicitis.

295
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:21,362
Ooh. "Raynbow."

296
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:23,697
I'm gonna add that to
my list of baby names.

297
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:25,028
Really? Yep.

298
00:11:25,052 --> 00:11:27,419
Right after Bubba,
Toolio and Agamemnon.

299
00:11:27,487 --> 00:11:28,527
Agamemnon?

300
00:11:28,588 --> 00:11:30,438
That's pretty.

301
00:11:30,507 --> 00:11:32,657
No, it's not. It's child abuse.

302
00:11:32,726 --> 00:11:34,403
But Callie keeps shooting down

303
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:36,038
all the cute names
that I suggest,

304
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:38,563
so my new strategy is
to bury the cute names

305
00:11:38,632 --> 00:11:40,264
in a sea of terrible ones.

306
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:43,918
So... Zamboni,
Hashtag and Digger.

307
00:11:43,987 --> 00:11:46,571
Wow. You guys aren't even
pregnant yet, and you're so...

308
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:48,200
Crazy? No, no.

309
00:11:48,224 --> 00:11:49,368
I was gonna say excited.

310
00:11:49,392 --> 00:11:50,991
Imagine how insufferable I'll be

311
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:53,194
when there's an actual
baby to talk about.

312
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,601
<i>Once we came up with
a closed seeding system,</i>

313
00:11:59,669 --> 00:12:01,435
<i>we were able to speed the time</i>

314
00:12:01,505 --> 00:12:05,005
<i>between bone-marrow
aspiration and graft implantation.</i>

315
00:12:05,608 --> 00:12:07,074
<i>Next.</i>

316
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:08,383
I have a question.

317
00:12:12,448 --> 00:12:13,448
<i>Yes.</i>

318
00:12:13,516 --> 00:12:15,144
Does the difference
in tensile strength

319
00:12:15,168 --> 00:12:17,701
between the patient's tissue
and the bioprinted conduit

320
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:20,188
increase the risk of turbulent
flow at the anastomosis?

321
00:12:20,256 --> 00:12:22,756
<i>No. Our conduits
exhibit laminar flow.</i>

322
00:12:22,826 --> 00:12:26,160
<i>And testing revealed a tensile
strength of 0.6 megapascals.</i>

323
00:12:26,229 --> 00:12:27,945
Without long-term follow-up,

324
00:12:28,014 --> 00:12:29,742
how can you claim
that your conduit

325
00:12:29,766 --> 00:12:32,917
supercedes the standard
prosthetic conduit?

326
00:12:32,986 --> 00:12:35,453
<i>We expect our conduits
to grow and remodel</i>

327
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:36,899
<i>throughout the
patient's lifetime.</i>

328
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:40,708
Thus obviating the
need for serial operations.

329
00:12:42,945 --> 00:12:44,679
<i>Exactly.</i>

330
00:12:44,747 --> 00:12:47,848
<i>More time-consuming up
front, but worth it in the long run.</i>

331
00:12:47,917 --> 00:12:49,383
Don't you run the risk

332
00:12:49,452 --> 00:12:53,771
of your cells
undergoing apoptosis

333
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,990
when seeded on the hydrogel?

334
00:12:59,095 --> 00:13:02,196
<i>That was a concern initially,</i>

335
00:13:02,265 --> 00:13:04,732
<i>but we discovered
90% of the seeded cells</i>

336
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,135
<i>remained viable after one week.</i>

337
00:13:08,738 --> 00:13:10,104
<i>I was very surprised.</i>

338
00:13:12,192 --> 00:13:14,091
Fascinating.

339
00:13:14,161 --> 00:13:15,401
Thank you, Dr. Yang.

340
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:32,154
We would love to see the
data from your initial patients.

341
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:33,845
Oh, well, your
office has my e-mail.

342
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:36,280
I'd be happy to share
it with you. Beautiful.

343
00:13:36,349 --> 00:13:38,094
You were wise to
bring her, Burke.

344
00:13:38,118 --> 00:13:40,278
She'll teach us
all a thing or two.

345
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:41,793
She certainly will.

346
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,239
You did this?

347
00:13:45,308 --> 00:13:47,842
I thought it was
someone named Weiss.

348
00:13:49,211 --> 00:13:52,146
Weiss is one of my staff.

349
00:13:52,214 --> 00:13:56,216
I didn't think you'd respond
to an invitation from me,

350
00:13:56,286 --> 00:13:58,870
given the circumstances
of our last interaction.

351
00:13:58,939 --> 00:14:01,122
Me in a white dress
and you fleeing the state.

352
00:14:02,876 --> 00:14:06,810
Well, a follow-up
to that is delicate.

353
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,013
Why am I here?

354
00:14:09,082 --> 00:14:11,394
Because I wanted to talk to you

355
00:14:11,418 --> 00:14:14,919
about your unpublished
details of your protocol.

356
00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:17,505
And you brought me
6,000 miles to discuss it?

357
00:14:17,574 --> 00:14:19,273
Well, this is my hospital.

358
00:14:19,342 --> 00:14:22,876
I get to fly people 6,000
miles to ask them questions.

359
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:28,916
Let me return the favor.

360
00:14:28,985 --> 00:14:30,363
Show you what I've
been working on.

361
00:14:30,387 --> 00:14:31,764
I have a surgery this afternoon.

362
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:34,304
I would really love
for you to scrub in.

363
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:35,823
Unless you have plans.

364
00:14:40,113 --> 00:14:41,362
I have to make a phone call.

365
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,899
Oh, go ahead.

366
00:14:44,968 --> 00:14:47,208
I'll catch up with you later.

367
00:14:48,237 --> 00:14:50,170
And, uh...

368
00:14:50,239 --> 00:14:52,239
Tell Meredith I say hello.

369
00:15:00,433 --> 00:15:02,599
Hey, is that her?

370
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:04,535
Voicemail. We keep
missing each other.

371
00:15:04,604 --> 00:15:05,720
Is she having a good time?

372
00:15:05,788 --> 00:15:08,238
Yeah, she's just saying
her speech went well and...

373
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:09,640
<i>Burke is here.</i>

374
00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:10,942
What?

375
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:12,872
<i>Burke. Here.</i> Shut up.

376
00:15:12,896 --> 00:15:14,095
What?

377
00:15:14,164 --> 00:15:15,596
<i>Yeah, he brought me here.</i>

378
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:17,097
Nothing, nothing.

379
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:20,218
She's saying that she
got a standing ovation.

380
00:15:22,122 --> 00:15:23,482
I knew this trip was
gonna be great for her.

381
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:25,072
<i>Mer, call me back.</i>

382
00:15:25,141 --> 00:15:27,252
I can't do this. You guys,
the last time I did this, I went...

383
00:15:27,276 --> 00:15:29,610
Through the table. We know.
That's why we're practicing.

384
00:15:30,413 --> 00:15:32,063
What are we doing?

385
00:15:32,132 --> 00:15:33,992
Dr. Shepherd picked Leah to do
the burr holes on the Cooper twins.

386
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:35,528
Doesn't he know
that last time she...

387
00:15:35,552 --> 00:15:36,667
Shut up.

388
00:15:36,719 --> 00:15:38,135
How's scut?

389
00:15:38,204 --> 00:15:40,404
Fine. I'm actually killing it.

390
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:45,930
You're killing her!

391
00:15:45,962 --> 00:15:47,228
I can't do this.

392
00:15:47,296 --> 00:15:48,862
Stop it. That
was your first one.

393
00:15:48,931 --> 00:15:50,364
You know how hard to go now.

394
00:15:50,433 --> 00:15:51,566
Try it again.

395
00:15:55,605 --> 00:15:58,138
I just think it's kind of
shocking that the first option

396
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:00,808
tossed onto the table
for a pregnant woman

397
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:02,621
with mixed feelings
is termination.

398
00:16:02,645 --> 00:16:04,879
I think she's just
doing her job.

399
00:16:05,815 --> 00:16:07,760
Can you just be on my side?

400
00:16:07,784 --> 00:16:08,949
I am on your side.

401
00:16:09,018 --> 00:16:10,696
I just don't think we
need to vilify the OB

402
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,030
for one comment. I wasn't.

403
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:13,294
I was...

404
00:16:16,258 --> 00:16:18,258
Maybe I was. I don't know.

405
00:16:19,495 --> 00:16:21,375
I don't want to
fight. Me neither.

406
00:16:22,532 --> 00:16:24,710
What about
Phoebe if it's a girl?

407
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:26,651
Phoebe freebie? Slutty.

408
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:31,855
Uh, but cute. Terrific.

409
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:33,173
It's one of the better names.

410
00:16:33,243 --> 00:16:34,725
Dr. Webber.

411
00:16:34,794 --> 00:16:37,195
Did I hear that you called
a meeting of the board?

412
00:16:37,263 --> 00:16:38,713
Yeah, I did.

413
00:16:38,781 --> 00:16:41,181
Well, next time, could you
please make sure I'm available?

414
00:16:41,251 --> 00:16:44,285
Well, we needed to discuss
some issues with the foundation.

415
00:16:44,354 --> 00:16:45,497
Your input wasn't needed.

416
00:16:45,521 --> 00:16:47,205
Excuse me, sir.

417
00:16:47,273 --> 00:16:49,819
If you have something to say
about the foundation, you say it to me.

418
00:16:49,843 --> 00:16:51,592
I would appreciate that.

419
00:16:51,661 --> 00:16:53,995
Okay, well, here's
what I'll say, then.

420
00:16:54,063 --> 00:16:56,124
I built this place with
certain ideals in mind,

421
00:16:56,148 --> 00:16:57,860
and I'm not gonna
let them be trifled with.

422
00:16:57,884 --> 00:17:00,685
We got in bed with
your foundation too fast.

423
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:03,165
It's clear that there are
certain fundamental differences

424
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:04,266
of philosophy.

425
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:06,991
It's not gonna work.
It's a doomed marriage.

426
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,916
Okay, Babs, let me know if
you feel any pain or discomfort.

427
00:17:15,985 --> 00:17:17,396
Wilson, everything okay in here?

428
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:19,248
Yeah. All good. Just
passing the catheter.

429
00:17:19,272 --> 00:17:20,883
Well, you're running
Braden's labs?

430
00:17:20,907 --> 00:17:22,173
Yeah, just like you said.

431
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:24,601
Good. Keep me updated on them.

432
00:17:25,695 --> 00:17:27,428
All right. Catheter's in.

433
00:17:27,496 --> 00:17:30,497
Babs, we're almost done here.
I just need to remove the wire.

434
00:17:30,566 --> 00:17:31,916
My lucky charm.

435
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:33,012
Didn't feel a pinch.

436
00:17:33,036 --> 00:17:35,086
I've had lots of practice.

437
00:17:36,122 --> 00:17:37,922
Oh. Ow!

438
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:39,206
That hurts.

439
00:17:39,275 --> 00:17:41,725
It's not coming out. The
wire snagged on something.

440
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:43,194
What's happening?

441
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:45,629
Push 0.5 of hydromorphone.

442
00:17:45,682 --> 00:17:48,181
Babs, just try and relax, okay?

443
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:50,610
The contours are
virtually seamless.

444
00:17:50,837 --> 00:17:51,997
I'm impressed, Torres.

445
00:17:52,021 --> 00:17:53,599
It took hours of meticulous work

446
00:17:53,623 --> 00:17:55,133
to perfect these pieces, Derek.

447
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:56,590
Amelia better not screw it up.

448
00:17:56,659 --> 00:17:57,802
Why would you think that?

449
00:17:57,826 --> 00:17:59,304
You treat her like
she's the village idiot.

450
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:00,739
I do not. Yes, you do.

451
00:18:00,763 --> 00:18:02,407
And I need you to tell me
that she's not the village idiot.

452
00:18:02,431 --> 00:18:05,266
She is not the village idiot.

453
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:06,762
I wouldn't let her
near the Coopers

454
00:18:06,786 --> 00:18:09,026
if she weren't
exceedingly capable.

455
00:18:09,722 --> 00:18:11,589
Hey, is that the...

456
00:18:11,657 --> 00:18:14,191
A fully functioning
robotic leg? Yes, it is.

457
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:17,361
Well, I thought my absence
totally stalled the progress.

458
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:18,596
It did.

459
00:18:18,664 --> 00:18:20,309
So I kind of took it in
a different direction.

460
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:22,133
I'm redirecting the
peripheral nerve signals

461
00:18:22,168 --> 00:18:24,451
to send commands
directly to the prosthetic leg,

462
00:18:24,521 --> 00:18:26,587
eliminating your
sensors entirely.

463
00:18:26,656 --> 00:18:27,776
I've cut out the middleman.

464
00:18:27,824 --> 00:18:29,001
Oh, so I'm the middleman?

465
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:31,125
No, I still need you
to connect the nerves.

466
00:18:31,194 --> 00:18:32,738
So I'm just the
mechanic? Kind of.

467
00:18:32,762 --> 00:18:34,122
But I would never
let you near it

468
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,779
if you weren't
exceedingly capable.

469
00:18:35,848 --> 00:18:37,726
<i>You have one new message.</i>

470
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,694
<i>Before you do something
rash, remember a few things.</i>

471
00:18:39,718 --> 00:18:41,868
<i>Remember that he
cut away pieces of you.</i>

472
00:18:41,937 --> 00:18:44,088
<i>Remember that his
mama took your eyebrows.</i>

473
00:18:44,157 --> 00:18:45,634
<i>And remember that you've worked</i>

474
00:18:45,658 --> 00:18:47,578
<i>the past seven
years to get over...</i>

475
00:18:48,978 --> 00:18:50,310
It's just coffee.

476
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:51,995
You still drink it, right?

477
00:18:58,454 --> 00:19:01,339
You know, I'm gonna go. I
don't want to miss my flight.

478
00:19:01,407 --> 00:19:03,118
Oh, you're fine. I had Weiss put

479
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,693
another ticket on hold for you.

480
00:19:05,762 --> 00:19:09,196
You know, all this
secret making of plans

481
00:19:09,265 --> 00:19:10,809
and shuttling me around
on your own schedule...

482
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:12,433
It's manipulative.

483
00:19:12,501 --> 00:19:14,735
I'm sorry you see it that way.

484
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:18,438
You've been following my work?

485
00:19:18,507 --> 00:19:21,025
You gonna tell me you
haven't been following mine?

486
00:19:27,283 --> 00:19:30,563
This surgery you're about
to see is new, though.

487
00:19:31,754 --> 00:19:33,120
I didn't want to publish it

488
00:19:33,189 --> 00:19:35,423
until I was sure I had
what I thought I had.

489
00:19:36,659 --> 00:19:37,675
Do you?

490
00:19:41,548 --> 00:19:44,332
Come on. I'll show you.

491
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:03,584
They're prepped and ready to go.

492
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:06,654
Which one is twin A?

493
00:20:07,724 --> 00:20:09,156
Um...

494
00:20:09,225 --> 00:20:11,992
You need to identify the
twin with the best prognosis.

495
00:20:12,061 --> 00:20:13,872
If things start to go
poorly in surgery,

496
00:20:13,896 --> 00:20:15,474
the team throws
all of their resources

497
00:20:15,498 --> 00:20:17,932
toward the stronger
twin. Twin A.

498
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,785
It's better to have
one alive than neither.

499
00:20:20,853 --> 00:20:23,253
I'm a doctor. I
know how it works.

500
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:25,456
I delivered these
girls, Dr. Grey.

501
00:20:25,525 --> 00:20:27,719
I've been to their
college graduation,

502
00:20:27,743 --> 00:20:29,477
met their boyfriends.

503
00:20:29,545 --> 00:20:31,495
I helped bury their mother.

504
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:34,076
And I'd like for you to
tell me which is twin A,

505
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:38,151
so I can ask God to take a
little extra care of her sister.

506
00:20:40,122 --> 00:20:42,189
Lizzie is twin A.

507
00:20:42,257 --> 00:20:44,058
If things go bad in there,

508
00:20:44,126 --> 00:20:46,727
all of our resources
will go to her.

509
00:20:46,796 --> 00:20:48,929
God help Annie.

510
00:20:51,099 --> 00:20:52,999
Dr. Grey, we're ready.

511
00:20:55,904 --> 00:20:57,371
See you on the other side.

512
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,406
And we're gonna want
doughnuts, Kenzie.

513
00:20:59,474 --> 00:21:01,842
Don't worry, Annie.
I'll get you doughnuts.

514
00:21:19,395 --> 00:21:22,040
We're almost finished
procuring this vein.

515
00:21:22,064 --> 00:21:23,781
Okay, Murphy, how are we doing?

516
00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:25,199
She's doing great.

517
00:21:25,267 --> 00:21:29,486
She's done seven burr holes
and hasn't punctured the dura.

518
00:21:33,693 --> 00:21:36,259
Checking the last burr hole.

519
00:21:36,329 --> 00:21:39,246
Well done, Murphy. Perfect. Yay!

520
00:21:39,314 --> 00:21:40,742
Delicate vascular work here.

521
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:42,098
I'm sorry.

522
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:44,368
Okay, next, I'll need
a number 3 Penfield

523
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:48,289
to strip away the sagittal
sinus from the bone flap.

524
00:21:48,357 --> 00:21:50,119
Alex, pick up, pick up, pick up!

525
00:21:50,143 --> 00:21:52,092
See? I was right. You need me.

526
00:21:52,178 --> 00:21:53,321
<i>So, what did you screw up now?</i>

527
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:54,812
Alex, I... Look, I'm kidding.

528
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,158
And I'm in the
middle of a thing here.

529
00:21:56,182 --> 00:21:57,359
<i>Can I call you later?</i>

530
00:21:57,383 --> 00:21:58,432
Yeah. Okay.

531
00:21:58,518 --> 00:22:00,367
<i>I'll see you later.</i> Hi.

532
00:22:06,326 --> 00:22:08,304
Babs, the wire's caught
on something in your chest,

533
00:22:08,328 --> 00:22:11,223
so we're going to take an X-ray to
help us see what's going on inside.

534
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:13,347
Wilson. Oh, hey, I know...

535
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:16,483
You know that you still haven't
done the drain removal on 3922?

536
00:22:16,552 --> 00:22:18,814
I'm glad that you know that,
because for some reason it's not...

537
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:21,087
I'm coming right now.

538
00:22:21,156 --> 00:22:23,758
Babs, just hang on.
Everything's going to be okay.

539
00:22:25,561 --> 00:22:27,861
This vessel looks
like it belongs to Liz.

540
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:29,229
Agreed.

541
00:22:29,298 --> 00:22:31,160
I'll continue my dissection
millimeter by millimeter,

542
00:22:31,184 --> 00:22:33,150
until we're sure
they're stable enough

543
00:22:33,219 --> 00:22:35,452
to start ligating the
remaining vessels.

544
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:36,761
The vitals, please?

545
00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:41,024
Twin A, 110/70. Twin B, 140/90.

546
00:22:41,093 --> 00:22:44,494
Okay, now I'm going to start
clipping the bridging veins.

547
00:22:44,564 --> 00:22:47,798
Oh, no. Does that look like...
- Yes.

548
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:49,595
Damn it. It's getting dusky.

549
00:22:49,619 --> 00:22:50,951
Probably propagating.

550
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,631
Tissues are edematous,
moving medially...

551
00:22:52,655 --> 00:22:54,016
Towards the sinus.
If it gets there...

552
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,266
Both flows are
compromised. I know.

553
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:56,890
What's happening?

554
00:22:56,959 --> 00:22:58,203
Liz developed a clot, and
now they're trying to keep it

555
00:22:58,227 --> 00:23:00,022
from spreading to Annie's brain.

556
00:23:00,046 --> 00:23:02,775
They have to move quickly if
they're going to save Annie's life.

557
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:05,482
We have to separate them
now, and fast. Dissector!

558
00:23:05,551 --> 00:23:06,791
Try to stay midline.

559
00:23:06,836 --> 00:23:07,946
We'll control the bleeding
once they're separated.

560
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:09,280
Okay. Medium clips,
keep them coming.

561
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:10,671
Come on, Annie.

562
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:11,605
I'm confused. I thought
that Liz is twin A.

563
00:23:11,674 --> 00:23:13,724
I thought that if things

564
00:23:13,792 --> 00:23:15,103
went wrong, we were supposed
to throw all our resources to her.

565
00:23:15,127 --> 00:23:16,293
Not anymore.

566
00:23:20,316 --> 00:23:22,327
A transcatheter aortic
valve replacement.

567
00:23:22,351 --> 00:23:24,591
What's so special about this?

568
00:23:25,287 --> 00:23:26,386
You'll see.

569
00:23:31,227 --> 00:23:33,527
You lost the Harper Avery.

570
00:23:33,595 --> 00:23:35,813
Yes, I did.

571
00:23:37,099 --> 00:23:38,716
You shouldn't feel bad about it.

572
00:23:38,785 --> 00:23:40,578
Well, it's easy for you
to say. You won one.

573
00:23:40,602 --> 00:23:44,171
That's why I can say it.

574
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:50,810
There was a high after I won,
and I rode it for a long time.

575
00:23:50,879 --> 00:23:55,682
Then there was
a truly awful crash.

576
00:23:55,751 --> 00:23:59,152
The fear that my best
work was behind me.

577
00:23:59,221 --> 00:24:03,106
And the pressure I put
on myself was enormous.

578
00:24:03,175 --> 00:24:05,742
I had to get away,
so I came here.

579
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:08,312
Started working
quietly at first, and...

580
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:12,516
Then I met a gentleman

581
00:24:12,585 --> 00:24:15,118
that made a billion in the
European bond market.

582
00:24:15,187 --> 00:24:16,948
Wanted to put his
name on something.

583
00:24:16,972 --> 00:24:19,023
He bankrolled this whole place.

584
00:24:19,091 --> 00:24:20,891
I brought in people
from all over the world,

585
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,159
just to study hearts.

586
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:23,555
You don't get
government funding?

587
00:24:23,579 --> 00:24:24,778
Don't need it.

588
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:29,467
The interesting thing
about this patient is that

589
00:24:29,535 --> 00:24:32,202
he has an irregularly
shaped valve.

590
00:24:33,422 --> 00:24:35,862
That does not
make this interesting.

591
00:24:40,195 --> 00:24:41,195
Does this?

592
00:24:51,858 --> 00:24:55,226
That's his heart
in the hologram.

593
00:24:57,813 --> 00:25:02,282
Composed of pre-op scans.
Complete intraoperative visualization.

594
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:10,340
You can see it from
all angles in real time.

595
00:25:10,409 --> 00:25:13,777
And even slice it
to see the anatomy.

596
00:25:16,148 --> 00:25:17,981
Assess the ramifications without

597
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:19,816
bearing any of the
risks of blind entry.

598
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:23,100
That's what I've been
waiting to publish.

599
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:25,923
I just wanted to
get the kinks out.

600
00:25:30,679 --> 00:25:34,681
Was it worth you
sticking around for?

601
00:25:36,418 --> 00:25:37,498
Yes, it was.

602
00:25:42,091 --> 00:25:43,731
Wait till you see
the rest of the place.

603
00:25:59,475 --> 00:26:00,685
And, now!

604
00:26:00,709 --> 00:26:02,642
Irrigate the field.
Drape her loosely.

605
00:26:02,711 --> 00:26:04,273
Derek, you go with the
viable twin. I'll stay here.

606
00:26:04,297 --> 00:26:05,440
No, you go. I'll be right there.

607
00:26:05,464 --> 00:26:07,175
I just want to try
and retrieve the clot.

608
00:26:07,199 --> 00:26:09,127
It's a last-ditch effort, but it
may work. Can you save her?

609
00:26:09,151 --> 00:26:10,862
Well, if I remove all
the clot fast enough,

610
00:26:10,886 --> 00:26:12,513
but she'll still have deficits.

611
00:26:12,537 --> 00:26:17,241
Okay, my count, on
three. One, two, three.

612
00:26:18,794 --> 00:26:20,055
Don't worry about
Annie. I've got her.

613
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:21,745
I know you do.

614
00:26:21,814 --> 00:26:23,447
Okay, let's get Annie
next door, ASAP.

615
00:26:23,515 --> 00:26:25,260
I need more light,
heparinized shunt,

616
00:26:25,284 --> 00:26:27,644
and every nonessential
person out of here.

617
00:26:34,193 --> 00:26:35,692
All these printers are yours?

618
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:37,227
Yes.

619
00:26:37,296 --> 00:26:39,663
There's... Forty-nine.

620
00:26:39,732 --> 00:26:42,666
We had 50. One went
buggy. We sent it back.

621
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:47,538
So, you've completed

622
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:50,824
a phase one trial with
your conduits. What's next?

623
00:26:50,893 --> 00:26:52,559
I don't know. I can't...

624
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:57,875
I don't know now.
Everything's...

625
00:26:57,899 --> 00:26:59,332
Because of the award?

626
00:26:59,401 --> 00:27:01,018
I don't care about the award.

627
00:27:01,086 --> 00:27:03,031
Of course you do.
At least, you should.

628
00:27:03,055 --> 00:27:05,572
It's an assessment
from people who know

629
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,685
that you are what
you think you are.

630
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:10,360
Even you crave
that, regardless...

631
00:27:10,413 --> 00:27:12,061
I know how valid my work is.

632
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:13,363
So do I.

633
00:27:22,291 --> 00:27:25,759
I know what's
next, and it's big.

634
00:27:27,529 --> 00:27:28,962
But?

635
00:27:29,031 --> 00:27:30,097
But...

636
00:27:32,034 --> 00:27:33,845
You're afraid you
can't raise the support

637
00:27:33,869 --> 00:27:36,189
after you lost the award.

638
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,159
What is it?

639
00:27:45,781 --> 00:27:50,767
I want to print a functional
human heart, a beating heart.

640
00:27:54,874 --> 00:27:58,525
We'll do it here. It's
not impossible here.

641
00:27:58,593 --> 00:28:00,994
You can start tomorrow.
All you have to do is say yes.

642
00:28:09,838 --> 00:28:12,071
So, where is Yang on the appeal?

643
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:14,485
I don't know. I haven't
spoken to her since she left.

644
00:28:14,509 --> 00:28:15,669
Well, where is she?

645
00:28:15,695 --> 00:28:17,688
She's visiting a
hospital in Switzerland.

646
00:28:17,712 --> 00:28:18,845
She's what?

647
00:28:19,949 --> 00:28:21,348
Is she looking for another job?

648
00:28:22,401 --> 00:28:23,700
You see what you did?

649
00:28:23,769 --> 00:28:25,689
You're going to lose the
good ones, one by one.

650
00:28:25,738 --> 00:28:27,014
She just went to go give a talk.

651
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:29,373
I hope you're happy. Thanks
to you and your mother,

652
00:28:29,441 --> 00:28:32,142
pretty soon the only doctors
working here will be you and Knox.

653
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:33,943
You have to stop!

654
00:28:34,012 --> 00:28:36,975
It was your relationship with
the Harper Avery Foundation

655
00:28:36,999 --> 00:28:38,493
that brought them
here in the first place.

656
00:28:38,517 --> 00:28:41,484
You're embarrassed and
you're ashamed, and I'm sorry,

657
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:44,432
but I will not let you take it
out on Dr. Avery anymore.

658
00:28:44,456 --> 00:28:47,841
He deserves your respect.
He's not his mother. So stop it.

659
00:29:06,194 --> 00:29:07,460
I never received Babs' films.

660
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:08,773
I sent them up to Dr. Hunt.

661
00:29:08,797 --> 00:29:10,580
What? Why?

662
00:29:10,649 --> 00:29:13,769
It was a critical result, and
he's the attending on the chart.

663
00:29:16,238 --> 00:29:17,371
Where is she?

664
00:29:17,439 --> 00:29:19,490
With Dr. Hunt. Took
her upstairs to surgery.

665
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:24,739
Oh, Steph, I need you! Can you
go check on Braden Morris' labs?

666
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:27,208
Bailey is checking for
leukocytosis to rule out leukemia.

667
00:29:27,232 --> 00:29:28,542
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

668
00:29:28,566 --> 00:29:30,766
Leukemia? Why is Bailey...

669
00:29:35,307 --> 00:29:37,552
How's Annie's saphenous
vein graft coming?

670
00:29:37,576 --> 00:29:38,942
Patent, thankfully.

671
00:29:39,011 --> 00:29:42,278
Good. Need an
extra set of hands?

672
00:29:42,347 --> 00:29:44,530
No, I'm just about
to close the dura.

673
00:29:45,951 --> 00:29:47,050
Good.

674
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:51,621
Wow. Shepherd
fix Lizzie already?

675
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:54,624
He didn't fix her.

676
00:29:58,631 --> 00:30:00,614
Dr. Hunt, I should
have called you but...

677
00:30:00,682 --> 00:30:03,928
If not me, then someone. This
hospital is full of doctors, Wilson.

678
00:30:03,952 --> 00:30:06,197
Because you tried to
remove the wire by yourself,

679
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:08,065
forcefully, you perforated

680
00:30:08,089 --> 00:30:11,652
the posterior wall of the
subclavian vein, causing her to bleed.

681
00:30:11,676 --> 00:30:13,276
Oh, God. And now
I have to perform

682
00:30:13,345 --> 00:30:16,713
an emergency venous repair and
her colectomy has to be postponed.

683
00:30:16,781 --> 00:30:18,231
I was trying to
handle everything.

684
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,699
And you made it worse.

685
00:30:30,796 --> 00:30:33,079
Sit down. I'll
order some dinner.

686
00:30:38,686 --> 00:30:39,926
Are you not hungry?

687
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:43,990
You want me to come work here?

688
00:30:44,059 --> 00:30:45,408
That's what I said, yes.

689
00:30:48,681 --> 00:30:52,065
I no longer have the ability
to interpret your noises.

690
00:30:52,134 --> 00:30:55,018
Is this some ploy to
get me back in your life?

691
00:30:55,087 --> 00:30:56,970
Because I'm not interested.

692
00:31:02,244 --> 00:31:08,465
My wife, Edra. That is Simone,
she's five. Vivianna just turned four.

693
00:31:12,437 --> 00:31:16,956
I'm happy, Cristina.
Edra is the love of my life.

694
00:31:17,025 --> 00:31:20,643
She's my world. My
family is my world.

695
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:21,744
That's nice.

696
00:31:24,099 --> 00:31:27,266
I don't want you, Cristina.

697
00:31:30,723 --> 00:31:33,356
Okay, I don't mean
it like it sounds.

698
00:31:33,425 --> 00:31:36,976
No, I mean Edra
wants to be a mom.

699
00:31:37,045 --> 00:31:40,564
She trained as a surgeon
and she gave it up.

700
00:31:40,632 --> 00:31:42,866
Now she stays home
and takes care of the kids.

701
00:31:42,934 --> 00:31:44,963
She's supportive of
me, of my dreams.

702
00:31:44,987 --> 00:31:50,440
Well, that's good for
you. I'm happy for you.

703
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:58,815
When you do what you and
I do, as fiercely as we do it,

704
00:31:58,883 --> 00:32:01,096
you need somebody
that's willing to stay home

705
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,898
and keep the home fires burning.

706
00:32:02,922 --> 00:32:04,633
That's the only way you and I
are ever going to have someone.

707
00:32:04,657 --> 00:32:09,141
You don't know me anymore.
I see your life has moved on.

708
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:11,194
I want you to know mine has too.

709
00:32:21,406 --> 00:32:26,777
You're right. I don't know you.

710
00:32:26,845 --> 00:32:30,346
But I know that you've
become a magnificent surgeon.

711
00:32:35,887 --> 00:32:38,168
You've become everything
I dreamed you'd be.

712
00:32:40,909 --> 00:32:45,195
You should be in a place like
this. You should consider it.

713
00:32:53,738 --> 00:32:56,739
He has a family, and
a holographic heart,

714
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:59,876
and he wants to
bankroll my research

715
00:32:59,945 --> 00:33:01,623
for printing a functional heart.

716
00:33:01,647 --> 00:33:03,647
I mean, he's got
like 49 printers

717
00:33:03,716 --> 00:33:05,716
and a bottomless
pit of money, and...

718
00:33:05,784 --> 00:33:09,052
How the hell are you not
answering your phone right now?

719
00:33:09,121 --> 00:33:12,355
Mer, everything I have
ever wanted is here.

720
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:16,292
Except he's here.

721
00:33:16,361 --> 00:33:18,361
So what the hell
am I supposed to do?

722
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:21,998
I mean, what would
you tell me to do?

723
00:33:27,656 --> 00:33:28,656
Yeah.

724
00:33:41,202 --> 00:33:43,403
Annie decided to withdraw care?

725
00:33:43,472 --> 00:33:44,672
Mmm-hmm.

726
00:33:56,902 --> 00:33:58,635
Any change on Lizzie?

727
00:33:58,704 --> 00:34:00,404
No. They'll be
withdrawing care soon.

728
00:34:05,059 --> 00:34:06,893
You do remember
how hard it was to

729
00:34:06,962 --> 00:34:09,028
find the money to
keep this place going.

730
00:34:09,097 --> 00:34:12,716
The foundation was our
Hail Mary and you saved us.

731
00:34:12,785 --> 00:34:16,219
We have to find a way
to make it work with them.

732
00:34:16,288 --> 00:34:19,790
I was there, the night your
mother won her first Harper Avery.

733
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:23,910
I wasn't with her. I
was sitting in the back.

734
00:34:23,979 --> 00:34:25,512
Because my father was with her?

735
00:34:27,999 --> 00:34:31,201
That award was
our gold standard.

736
00:34:31,269 --> 00:34:32,880
It was the measure
of our success.

737
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:34,465
It was everything we worked for.

738
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:36,756
And I had to be there to
see the look on her face.

739
00:34:36,825 --> 00:34:39,292
She was radiant.

740
00:34:41,213 --> 00:34:45,831
Catherine made it meaningless
with this. She cheapened it.

741
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:48,952
She cheapened our goals.
She cheapened her memory.

742
00:34:49,872 --> 00:34:52,005
I can't stand that.

743
00:34:52,073 --> 00:34:54,240
Uh, Richard. You got a minute?

744
00:35:00,816 --> 00:35:05,184
Dr. Bailey, I have Braden's
most recent results.

745
00:35:05,253 --> 00:35:08,021
Oh, thank you, Dr. Edwards.

746
00:35:08,089 --> 00:35:10,050
You're testing his white
blood cell differential?

747
00:35:10,074 --> 00:35:11,508
I'm running many tests.

748
00:35:11,577 --> 00:35:13,143
His T cell count is up.

749
00:35:13,212 --> 00:35:16,045
A boy with no immune system
grew over 500 T cells overnight?

750
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:20,317
I think you administered
the deactivated virus against

751
00:35:20,385 --> 00:35:21,518
his parents' wishes.

752
00:35:21,587 --> 00:35:23,102
Okay! It worked!

753
00:35:23,171 --> 00:35:28,424
And it's working! It's
amazing. You're amazing.

754
00:35:32,497 --> 00:35:35,665
I don't know what
you're talking about.

755
00:35:39,954 --> 00:35:41,132
So, you agree?

756
00:35:41,156 --> 00:35:43,123
This resident's not
cut out to be a surgeon.

757
00:35:43,191 --> 00:35:45,725
Yep. Either you're a
surgeon or you're not.

758
00:35:50,966 --> 00:35:53,049
I can't get fired. My
parents will disown me.

759
00:35:53,118 --> 00:35:54,951
I'll end up back in school.

760
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:56,786
I'll end up back in jail.

761
00:35:56,855 --> 00:35:59,756
Will you stop? If any
one of us is fired, it's me.

762
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:01,891
I went crazy, very publicly.

763
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:05,395
I disrupted an entire
OR. I'm a surgical liability.

764
00:36:05,464 --> 00:36:07,230
And Shepherd hates me now.

765
00:36:07,298 --> 00:36:08,965
Hunt hates me. You
should have seen

766
00:36:09,033 --> 00:36:10,667
his face today
when I screwed up.

767
00:36:10,736 --> 00:36:14,771
My ex owns the
hospital. It's me.

768
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:18,041
I heard that residencies
sometimes clean house,

769
00:36:18,109 --> 00:36:21,344
like fire an entire class of
residents and start fresh.

770
00:36:26,768 --> 00:36:29,535
Hey. What?

771
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:32,372
Nothing. I just had
a really good day.

772
00:36:34,075 --> 00:36:35,675
Next round's on him.

773
00:36:45,287 --> 00:36:46,287
Ah.

774
00:36:47,389 --> 00:36:49,656
You spoke to Meredith.

775
00:36:49,724 --> 00:36:53,225
No. And no, I
can't take the job.

776
00:36:53,295 --> 00:36:55,072
Thank you for the offer, but no.

777
00:36:55,096 --> 00:36:58,865
Ah. Meredith carries a grudge.

778
00:36:58,933 --> 00:37:00,577
This has nothing
to do with Meredith

779
00:37:00,601 --> 00:37:02,146
or a grudge. It's
far from that simple.

780
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:04,971
Really? Please don't.

781
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,902
You got me here. We had
our fun. Take no for an answer.

782
00:37:07,926 --> 00:37:09,225
Why?

783
00:37:10,161 --> 00:37:11,428
"Why"?

784
00:37:11,496 --> 00:37:14,197
Honestly, it doesn't
make any sense.

785
00:37:16,017 --> 00:37:19,369
You think I want to
work for you again?

786
00:37:19,438 --> 00:37:23,857
I never wanted to work
for you. I wanted to be you.

787
00:37:25,327 --> 00:37:27,861
The best thing that
ever happened to me

788
00:37:27,929 --> 00:37:29,673
was you walking
away from our wedding.

789
00:37:29,697 --> 00:37:31,775
It made me stand
on my own two feet.

790
00:37:31,799 --> 00:37:33,811
I am better for it.
You are better for it.

791
00:37:33,835 --> 00:37:35,413
Will you just hold...
So why bring me here?

792
00:37:35,437 --> 00:37:38,338
Why offer me a job
you know I can't resist?

793
00:37:38,407 --> 00:37:40,268
You're going to dangle a carrot
and I'm supposed to chase it

794
00:37:40,292 --> 00:37:42,992
until you snatch it
away? I don't want the job!

795
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:44,580
Are you done? No!

796
00:37:57,859 --> 00:37:58,992
Now I am.

797
00:38:00,812 --> 00:38:02,292
I don't want you to work for me.

798
00:38:03,615 --> 00:38:09,118
Us working together would
destroy my marriage, my life.

799
00:38:15,327 --> 00:38:21,313
The way I loved you was
consuming. And eventually...

800
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:27,520
You hold the carrot.
I'll be chasing you.

801
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:32,091
I have a family
now, a life that...

802
00:38:34,162 --> 00:38:35,162
A life I want.

803
00:38:38,033 --> 00:38:40,383
I don't want you to work for me.

804
00:38:40,452 --> 00:38:41,879
You just offered me a job.

805
00:38:41,903 --> 00:38:43,303
I don't want you to work for me!

806
00:38:43,371 --> 00:38:45,689
I want you to take over for me.

807
00:38:51,546 --> 00:38:52,611
I'm leaving.

808
00:38:54,899 --> 00:38:56,332
Edra's parents are in Milan

809
00:38:56,401 --> 00:38:58,051
and she wants to
be closer to them.

810
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:00,680
Wait. She's made so
many sacrifices for me.

811
00:39:00,706 --> 00:39:03,490
And now I think it's time for
me to do the same for her.

812
00:39:03,558 --> 00:39:05,158
Wait.

813
00:39:05,227 --> 00:39:06,827
I've been wanting
to leave for a while.

814
00:39:06,861 --> 00:39:10,597
But I just haven't been able
to find anyone that I was willing

815
00:39:10,665 --> 00:39:13,516
to give the institute
to, until now. Wait.

816
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:19,672
You're offering
me your hospital,

817
00:39:19,741 --> 00:39:22,753
like you're Willy Wonka and you're
handing me a chocolate factory?

818
00:39:26,047 --> 00:39:27,480
Cheer up, Charlie.

819
00:39:27,548 --> 00:39:28,915
You're not serious?

820
00:39:38,977 --> 00:39:40,217
You are serious.

821
00:39:43,915 --> 00:39:47,183
This place is yours,
Cristina, if you want it.

822
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:48,719
Do you?

823
00:39:52,073 --> 00:39:53,573
<i>Open your eyes.</i>

824
00:40:01,183 --> 00:40:03,733
Hi. Hey.

825
00:40:03,801 --> 00:40:05,101
How did you know I was...

826
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:06,386
I know who you hang out with.

827
00:40:19,517 --> 00:40:20,983
You okay?

828
00:40:22,821 --> 00:40:24,587
Yeah.

829
00:40:24,656 --> 00:40:26,856
Yeah. I just needed
to sit down for a bit.

830
00:40:29,594 --> 00:40:31,875
Should probably get used
to these seats, though.

831
00:40:34,466 --> 00:40:37,700
I can't change who I am.

832
00:40:37,769 --> 00:40:40,737
But that doesn't mean
I want to sit at home

833
00:40:40,806 --> 00:40:43,306
every Sunday when
my family's off at church.

834
00:40:44,659 --> 00:40:46,704
You would go to church with me?

835
00:40:46,728 --> 00:40:49,762
You're my wife.
Of course I will.

836
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:53,983
As long as we can
get waffles after.

837
00:40:56,087 --> 00:40:58,854
We can have waffles after.

838
00:40:58,923 --> 00:41:03,459
<i>What do you see?
More possibilities?</i>

839
00:41:03,528 --> 00:41:05,161
Agamemnon.

840
00:41:06,598 --> 00:41:09,332
I kind of love it. Yeah.

841
00:41:17,692 --> 00:41:20,509
Callie Torres has a
really interesting project.

842
00:41:22,314 --> 00:41:26,065
She needs an exceptional
neurosurgeon. I recommended you.

843
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:29,646
Derek, I don't live here.

844
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:31,554
Maybe you should.

845
00:41:31,623 --> 00:41:35,642
I like having you here.
You're my favorite sister.

846
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:38,278
You say that to all of us.

847
00:41:38,346 --> 00:41:40,613
But I will choose to believe you

848
00:41:40,682 --> 00:41:43,122
because you are
my favorite brother.

849
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:47,480
<i>Does your new view
give you more hope?</i>

850
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:59,265
<i>That's the goal. Although it
doesn't always work out that way.</i>

851
00:42:01,636 --> 00:42:04,236
Chocolate. I ate some.

852
00:42:11,129 --> 00:42:12,369
You're leaving.

853
00:42:14,465 --> 00:42:16,298
<i>Sometimes, a shift
in perspective just</i>

854
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:18,207
<i>makes you see what you've lost.</i>
