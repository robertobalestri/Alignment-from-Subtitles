1
00:00:05,473 --> 00:00:08,040
<i>The waiting can kill you.</i>

2
00:00:11,895 --> 00:00:15,213
<i>You make a decision, and
then the world has to turn.</i>

3
00:00:25,676 --> 00:00:29,111
<i>The consequences unfold.</i>

4
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:30,813
<i>Out of your hands.</i>

5
00:00:30,881 --> 00:00:33,481
<i>There's only one
thing that seems clear</i>

6
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:35,862
<i>in those quiet
moments while you wait.</i>

7
00:00:35,886 --> 00:00:38,153
<i>Whatever you chose was wrong.</i>

8
00:00:38,222 --> 00:00:41,356
You think he put
you in his will? No.

9
00:00:41,425 --> 00:00:43,992
Next of kin. Maybe
you get the house.

10
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:45,594
I have a house.

11
00:00:45,662 --> 00:00:47,691
Well, you can give me his
house. I mean, I could use a house.

12
00:00:47,715 --> 00:00:48,909
He's not my father.

13
00:00:48,933 --> 00:00:50,610
I've been telling
him this for years.

14
00:00:50,634 --> 00:00:53,046
He just feels guilty because he
busted up my parents' marriage.

15
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:54,553
That's not my problem.

16
00:00:54,621 --> 00:00:55,887
It is now.

17
00:00:55,956 --> 00:00:58,673
Yeah, I mean, sticking
me with his end of life care,

18
00:00:58,742 --> 00:01:02,377
doesn't ask, doesn't give
me an out, that's real love.

19
00:01:02,446 --> 00:01:03,824
Well, it sounds
like family to me.

20
00:01:03,848 --> 00:01:05,247
Maybe he is your father.

21
00:01:05,316 --> 00:01:06,965
Banged your mom enough. Alex.

22
00:01:07,034 --> 00:01:08,994
Did they know each other
before you were born?

23
00:01:09,019 --> 00:01:10,686
They met when I was three.

24
00:01:10,754 --> 00:01:12,987
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
That's what they told you.

25
00:01:13,908 --> 00:01:15,757
I gotta get back to the ER.

26
00:01:18,629 --> 00:01:20,306
Ow. Oh, no, no. Let me get it.

27
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:23,498
This is Yang.

28
00:01:23,567 --> 00:01:24,899
And how about Brooks?

29
00:01:28,605 --> 00:01:29,771
Hey.

30
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,172
I know. I'm fine.

31
00:01:31,241 --> 00:01:33,375
Hey, look. I need to run
to my nec fasc surgery.

32
00:01:33,444 --> 00:01:34,921
He's in cardiogenic shock. No.

33
00:01:34,945 --> 00:01:37,262
Bailey feels like there's
likely some internal necrosis.

34
00:01:37,331 --> 00:01:38,663
So she took him up to the OR.

35
00:01:38,716 --> 00:01:40,226
With this kind of
cardiac compromise?

36
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:41,366
Yeah, and she...

37
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:43,484
Uh-uh. She... Mom. Mom?

38
00:01:43,554 --> 00:01:44,853
Look...

39
00:01:48,342 --> 00:01:49,753
I need Hunt in here.

40
00:01:49,777 --> 00:01:50,954
I can try to... Now!

41
00:01:50,978 --> 00:01:53,145
Ready? Go. Two, three...

42
00:02:00,988 --> 00:02:02,854
Bowels are completely clean.

43
00:02:02,907 --> 00:02:04,406
Should we recheck the pelvis?

44
00:02:04,492 --> 00:02:06,057
I have, four times.

45
00:02:09,563 --> 00:02:12,142
<i>What the hell do
you think you're doing,</i>

46
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:14,043
<i>cutting open a man
in cardiogenic shock</i>

47
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:15,984
<i>with nothing on his CT?</i>

48
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:18,064
<i>There's dead tissue
somewhere inside him.</i>

49
00:02:18,088 --> 00:02:20,066
<i>I'd like to find it
before it kills him.</i>

50
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:24,242
<i>He can't handle this stress until
his cardiac status is stabilized!</i>

51
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:26,244
<i>Get him off that table!</i>

52
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:27,712
Lap pad, please.

53
00:02:27,781 --> 00:02:29,426
<i>Dr. Hunt!</i> Dr. Avery, I'm
gonna have to ask you

54
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:31,566
to keep it down while
we're doing our work.

55
00:02:33,854 --> 00:02:36,020
Huh, there's a surprise for you.

56
00:02:36,073 --> 00:02:37,900
Pressure's dropping. Is
his dopamine maxed out?

57
00:02:37,924 --> 00:02:40,542
Yeah, it's at 20.
Close the patient!

58
00:02:40,611 --> 00:02:42,021
Come on. Where are you?

59
00:02:42,045 --> 00:02:44,897
Dr. Hunt! Brooks is crashing.

60
00:02:44,949 --> 00:02:47,399
Bailey, he's having
runs of V-tach.

61
00:02:47,451 --> 00:02:49,600
Close him up!

62
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:56,390
Closing.

63
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,580
Can you get by
without me? Just go.

64
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:21,716
Hey, how's it going with Brooks?

65
00:03:31,261 --> 00:03:32,404
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

66
00:03:32,428 --> 00:03:34,346
You gotta drink the juice, man.

67
00:03:34,415 --> 00:03:36,192
You give us half your blood
and head back to the pile,

68
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,283
you're gonna pass out.

69
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,160
Heather didn't make it.

70
00:03:44,692 --> 00:03:47,492
Come on.

71
00:04:12,119 --> 00:04:14,552
I'm gonna give the interns
the rest of the night off.

72
00:04:14,622 --> 00:04:16,365
Can you give me a hand if
there's anything they drop?

73
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:17,823
Of course.

74
00:04:17,891 --> 00:04:19,674
I'm so sorry about Heather.

75
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,143
Yeah.

76
00:04:22,212 --> 00:04:25,025
Dr. Hunt, Lydia's desatting,
decreased breath sounds on the left.

77
00:04:25,049 --> 00:04:26,548
Sharpie lady.

78
00:04:26,616 --> 00:04:27,627
Oh. Should I throw
in a chest tube?

79
00:04:27,651 --> 00:04:29,451
Dr. Yang is gonna
take over that case.

80
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,760
Why? I can handle a chest tube.

81
00:04:34,224 --> 00:04:35,384
Oh, my God.

82
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:38,271
I got a woman with
necrotizing fasciitis,

83
00:04:38,295 --> 00:04:39,778
and the interns
aren't operating.

84
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:42,046
So can you... Of course.

85
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,293
Well, she's
already on the table,

86
00:04:43,317 --> 00:04:45,117
and the anesthesiologists
are lining her up.

87
00:04:45,152 --> 00:04:46,992
Be ready in 10. Okay. Hey.

88
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:52,674
It's just terrible.

89
00:04:52,743 --> 00:04:54,542
Jackson.

90
00:04:54,611 --> 00:04:57,913
Oh, hey. I'm sorry.

91
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:13,160
And what about Richard?

92
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:14,429
Still critical,

93
00:05:14,498 --> 00:05:17,466
but his pressure stabilized
once Bailey closed.

94
00:05:17,534 --> 00:05:20,102
So Bailey closed
because his vitals tanked,

95
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:22,753
or because Catherine Avery
was in the gallery screaming?

96
00:05:25,943 --> 00:05:27,759
Oh, Derek.

97
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:36,254
You heard about Brooks?

98
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:40,572
I can't believe it.

99
00:05:43,293 --> 00:05:45,393
Can we have a conversation?

100
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:48,363
Not now.

101
00:05:52,002 --> 00:05:54,302
I know you're mad.

102
00:05:54,371 --> 00:05:59,674
And telling everyone, I
guess I deserved that.

103
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:02,511
But if we could just...

104
00:06:02,579 --> 00:06:04,712
I said not now.

105
00:06:09,203 --> 00:06:11,135
Hey, it's right behind me!

106
00:06:11,205 --> 00:06:12,803
Are you headed back out?

107
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:16,486
Be careful, okay?

108
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:18,943
It was Avery, right?

109
00:06:19,012 --> 00:06:20,845
He's the guy that you...

110
00:06:20,914 --> 00:06:23,615
I get it. He's a
good-looking guy.

111
00:06:23,684 --> 00:06:25,812
Practically runs the
hospital. Matthew...

112
00:06:25,836 --> 00:06:27,346
And I proposed to you
in front of 100 people.

113
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:30,088
I didn't really give you the
opportunity to say no. So...

114
00:06:32,342 --> 00:06:34,142
Did you want to say no?

115
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,626
Callie?

116
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:22,373
Callie?

117
00:07:33,587 --> 00:07:34,667
Callie?

118
00:07:45,816 --> 00:07:48,382
We got the clot out but there
was just so much swelling.

119
00:07:48,451 --> 00:07:50,468
Couldn't get it to stop.

120
00:07:52,822 --> 00:07:54,062
Did you tell the family?

121
00:07:54,123 --> 00:07:56,675
Yeah, I had someone call
her mom when we found her

122
00:07:56,743 --> 00:07:58,743
to tell her that
she was injured.

123
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:01,012
She's coming down from
someplace in Oregon.

124
00:08:01,081 --> 00:08:02,242
I just didn't want to tell her

125
00:08:02,266 --> 00:08:03,526
when she was still on the road.

126
00:08:08,287 --> 00:08:11,339
Okay, so you need to go to
the day care and pick up Zola

127
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:12,919
because she's gonna
think we had a baby

128
00:08:12,943 --> 00:08:14,209
and forgot about her.

129
00:08:14,278 --> 00:08:15,743
I'll call the babysitter

130
00:08:15,812 --> 00:08:17,673
and tell her to meet you
at the house in an hour.

131
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:19,341
And you should tell
the interns to hang out

132
00:08:19,365 --> 00:08:21,405
and wait till Heather's
mom arrives.

133
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:26,637
Give me the baby.

134
00:08:26,707 --> 00:08:28,372
Okay.

135
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:37,431
I know.

136
00:08:42,572 --> 00:08:43,771
That is a lot of blood.

137
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,156
Should I book an OR?

138
00:08:45,225 --> 00:08:46,457
No, not yet.

139
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,104
We'll monitor her for
the next couple of hours

140
00:08:48,128 --> 00:08:49,143
and then decide.

141
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:53,131
My house.

142
00:08:55,468 --> 00:08:57,668
Ma'am, you've lost
quite a lot of blood.

143
00:08:57,738 --> 00:08:59,003
You should rest.

144
00:08:59,072 --> 00:09:01,239
I wouldn't worry about
the house right now.

145
00:09:01,307 --> 00:09:03,140
Oh.

146
00:09:04,661 --> 00:09:06,010
You can't scream at my doctors

147
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:07,390
when there is an
open body on the table.

148
00:09:07,414 --> 00:09:08,440
I can't believe
you let her talk you

149
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:09,541
into a boondoggle like that.

150
00:09:09,565 --> 00:09:11,326
Dr. Avery, if you
have any issues with...

151
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:12,817
Does he know why
you cut open a man

152
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:14,336
in severe cardiac distress

153
00:09:14,404 --> 00:09:16,415
just so you could poke around
and see what's going on?

154
00:09:16,439 --> 00:09:18,050
We looked at all of
the options. Tell him.

155
00:09:18,074 --> 00:09:19,941
You tell him you feel guilty

156
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:22,121
because the last thing
Richard Webber heard from you

157
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:25,112
is that he's a drunk
who ruined your life.

158
00:09:25,181 --> 00:09:27,448
After all he's done for you.

159
00:09:27,517 --> 00:09:29,617
We talk on the phone
for an hour every night.

160
00:09:29,686 --> 00:09:31,085
It came up.

161
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:32,920
You feel bad, go find a priest.

162
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:35,156
But do not try to fix
it with a Hail Mary

163
00:09:35,225 --> 00:09:38,476
that very well may kill the man!

164
00:09:38,544 --> 00:09:41,479
I want access to
his charts right now.

165
00:09:43,817 --> 00:09:45,683
I'll be back in about an hour.

166
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:47,569
Heather's mother won't
probably be here yet,

167
00:09:47,637 --> 00:09:48,770
but if she is,

168
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:50,316
uh, someone stay
with her until I get back.

169
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,450
We don't tell her, do we?

170
00:09:51,474 --> 00:09:52,540
No, I will.

171
00:09:52,626 --> 00:09:54,325
Just think of some
good Heather stories.

172
00:09:54,394 --> 00:09:55,727
Once she knows,

173
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:57,955
she's gonna want to know
that she died among friends.

174
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:07,222
Who's gonna wait?

175
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:09,370
I can't. I can't. She'll
see it in my face.

176
00:10:11,661 --> 00:10:12,705
What the hell is his problem?

177
00:10:12,729 --> 00:10:14,462
It's not like they were friends.

178
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:15,974
I am not waiting with
her alone. I'm not either.

179
00:10:15,998 --> 00:10:17,949
Okay. Nobody goes. We all wait.

180
00:10:18,018 --> 00:10:19,978
Now go find Shane and tell
him we're doing this together.

181
00:10:20,002 --> 00:10:22,286
What are you, my
mother? You find him.

182
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,956
Yes, yes, yes.

183
00:10:25,025 --> 00:10:26,602
Hey. Hey, can you
watch her for a minute?

184
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:27,937
Yeah. I need to get my laptop.

185
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:30,411
Come here.

186
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,690
What's going on?

187
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:33,998
My wife's an S-L-U-T.

188
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:35,895
Sofia and I are spending
the night at a hotel.

189
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:37,546
And then what?

190
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:39,570
I don't know. Okay,
I'll be right back.

191
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:43,604
We're gonna let
her stay at a hotel?

192
00:10:46,028 --> 00:10:49,631
So is this the woman whose
fiance is also a firefighter,

193
00:10:49,699 --> 00:10:51,110
but they couldn't
find him for a while?

194
00:10:51,134 --> 00:10:52,267
Yep. Forceps.

195
00:10:56,556 --> 00:10:58,701
Wow, this wound is really deep.

196
00:10:58,725 --> 00:11:00,152
To get good margins,
we're gonna have to...

197
00:11:00,176 --> 00:11:01,309
I got it.

198
00:11:05,548 --> 00:11:07,481
You are one sleepy girl.

199
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:09,831
I'm gonna get you
to bed right now.

200
00:11:12,688 --> 00:11:15,689
Um, I was gonna go to a hotel.

201
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:17,936
But Mer said I should come here.

202
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,444
Well, I guess I should have
read those five text messages.

203
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:21,753
I'm sorry.

204
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:24,833
I'm sorry. Sofia's
asleep in Zola's bed.

205
00:11:24,901 --> 00:11:26,634
And I can move her.

206
00:11:26,703 --> 00:11:28,937
She probably won't wake up.

207
00:11:30,473 --> 00:11:31,739
Yeah, okay.

208
00:11:33,676 --> 00:11:36,043
Catherine may be
right. I mean, it's possible

209
00:11:36,113 --> 00:11:39,380
I'm too close to
this to see it clearly.

210
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:42,283
Am I supposed to
be seeing this clearly?

211
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:47,554
Well, Yang was advocating for
a more conservative approach.

212
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:49,556
I guess that's what we go with.

213
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:54,962
Catherine's reviewing his
charts, labs, I don't know.

214
00:11:55,031 --> 00:11:57,499
If she wants to
make the decisions,

215
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:59,333
then maybe she should.

216
00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:04,066
Here you go. Thanks.

217
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:05,556
Hey, how is she doing?

218
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:07,224
Oh, I put in the chest tube.

219
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:09,326
One of her broken
ribs sliced into her lung.

220
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:10,996
So, I mean, she
put out a lot of blood.

221
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:13,097
We're watching her. Okay.

222
00:12:13,165 --> 00:12:15,165
How are you?

223
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:17,402
Fabulous.

224
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,186
Yeah.

225
00:12:20,957 --> 00:12:23,308
What? Nothing.

226
00:12:23,376 --> 00:12:25,726
What? I just...

227
00:12:28,631 --> 00:12:30,709
I wish I had known
it was gonna be

228
00:12:30,733 --> 00:12:32,729
the last time you
and I were together.

229
00:12:32,753 --> 00:12:35,486
I would have done
things a little differently.

230
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,256
Well, was the last time bad?

231
00:12:39,325 --> 00:12:40,853
No, the last time was Wednesday,

232
00:12:40,877 --> 00:12:42,872
when we knocked that
plate off the counter,

233
00:12:42,896 --> 00:12:45,391
and I spent half the night pulling
shards of glass out of your foot.

234
00:12:45,415 --> 00:12:46,747
That was not the last time.

235
00:12:46,816 --> 00:12:48,510
Yeah. Mm-hmm. It was?

236
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:50,234
Not our best work.

237
00:12:52,421 --> 00:12:53,621
Well, that's awful.

238
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:55,769
After the kind of run we had...

239
00:12:57,093 --> 00:12:58,776
It's just a shame.

240
00:13:02,549 --> 00:13:03,614
Shameful.

241
00:13:27,607 --> 00:13:30,274
Everyone I love either
cheats on me or dies.

242
00:13:30,343 --> 00:13:31,375
Callie...

243
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:34,595
Or cheats on me and dies.

244
00:13:34,664 --> 00:13:35,880
George did both.

245
00:13:35,949 --> 00:13:37,982
Arizona's not gonna die.

246
00:13:38,051 --> 00:13:40,185
Yeah, that doesn't
make me feel any better.

247
00:13:41,655 --> 00:13:43,054
Ugh.

248
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:46,024
I'm sorry. I'm
drinking all your wine.

249
00:13:46,092 --> 00:13:48,087
You should be
drinking all your wine

250
00:13:48,111 --> 00:13:51,506
after what you went through
tonight with Heather and...

251
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:54,165
And Richard, oh, my God!

252
00:13:54,234 --> 00:13:56,834
Why is everything so horrible?

253
00:13:56,903 --> 00:13:58,380
Please, it's okay. Go ahead.

254
00:13:58,404 --> 00:14:00,238
It's all yours.

255
00:14:00,307 --> 00:14:02,240
Yeah?

256
00:14:02,309 --> 00:14:03,675
Yeah. Please.

257
00:14:03,743 --> 00:14:05,042
Okay.

258
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:14,685
I'll open another bottle.

259
00:14:14,754 --> 00:14:15,870
Just page her!

260
00:14:15,939 --> 00:14:17,371
I can't page someone 911

261
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,117
without the name of
the patient... Andrea.

262
00:14:19,141 --> 00:14:20,285
When Dr. Torres calls in,
she'll expect to know who...

263
00:14:20,309 --> 00:14:21,959
No, there's no
patient. Just page her.

264
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:23,839
We can't page 911
without a patient emergency.

265
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:26,547
Look at me. Does it look
like this is not an emergency?

266
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:28,696
Hey, hey! What's going
on? What's going on?

267
00:14:28,735 --> 00:14:30,251
I need you to page Callie 911.

268
00:14:30,319 --> 00:14:31,835
Why?

269
00:14:31,905 --> 00:14:34,149
Because she took off with my
baby, and I don't know where.

270
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:35,551
And when I call her,
she doesn't pick up.

271
00:14:35,575 --> 00:14:37,655
All right, did she
maybe... No, just do it!

272
00:14:39,763 --> 00:14:41,974
So we were able to remove
all of the necrotic tissue,

273
00:14:41,998 --> 00:14:47,001
but the labs suggest that your
organs are beginning to fail.

274
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:48,710
Well, is there anything
that you can do?

275
00:14:48,754 --> 00:14:51,155
Well, we're giving you
some powerful antibiotics.

276
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:55,026
And we're hoping that
that stops the process.

277
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:58,195
But... But I might not make it.

278
00:14:58,264 --> 00:15:00,425
We are going to do
everything that we possibly can.

279
00:15:00,449 --> 00:15:02,082
Bri...

280
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:07,221
We want to get married now.

281
00:15:07,289 --> 00:15:09,924
Right now. No matter what
happens, we want to be married.

282
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:11,926
We need a chaplain.

283
00:15:15,181 --> 00:15:17,482
Hey, Bailey.

284
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:20,668
Arizona is in the lobby
screaming at nurses.

285
00:15:20,737 --> 00:15:22,002
Why?

286
00:15:22,071 --> 00:15:25,089
'Cause she has no idea
where Callie is. Or the baby.

287
00:15:25,158 --> 00:15:28,253
Oh, well, you need to tell
her they're at my house.

288
00:15:28,277 --> 00:15:30,122
Ha! Callie's not a
battered woman.

289
00:15:30,146 --> 00:15:32,258
We're not harboring her until
she gets a restraining order.

290
00:15:32,282 --> 00:15:33,798
She just wants some space.

291
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:36,817
But you don't think Arizona's
called her, like, 300 times?

292
00:15:36,886 --> 00:15:38,530
If Callie wanted her to
know where she was,

293
00:15:38,554 --> 00:15:39,803
she'd have told her.

294
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:40,966
You think it's okay that Arizona

295
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:42,067
doesn't know where her baby is?

296
00:15:42,091 --> 00:15:43,340
She's Sofia's mom, too.

297
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:45,237
They're both our friends.
We shouldn't take sides.

298
00:15:45,261 --> 00:15:48,179
It's not taking sides to tell
Arizona where her kid is.

299
00:15:48,231 --> 00:15:51,899
Oh, you think that's how
it's gonna go? Mm-mmm.

300
00:15:52,819 --> 00:15:55,453
What happened to your hair?

301
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:58,556
She wasn't funny-funny,
but she was weird-funny.

302
00:15:59,909 --> 00:16:01,336
We're not saying
that to her mom.

303
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,426
Hmm.

304
00:16:04,831 --> 00:16:06,541
Remember when she swallowed
that marble? We could talk about that.

305
00:16:06,565 --> 00:16:08,866
Her mom knows she
swallowed a marble, idiot.

306
00:16:08,918 --> 00:16:11,358
You know what? When you have
a better idea, you let me know.

307
00:16:11,404 --> 00:16:12,865
You were her roommate.

308
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:15,940
How do you not have a
single nice story about her?

309
00:16:16,009 --> 00:16:18,009
She took my white
sweater and returned it pink.

310
00:16:18,061 --> 00:16:19,772
She left the apartment
without waking me up

311
00:16:19,796 --> 00:16:22,280
when we both had rounds,
which she knew about and said,

312
00:16:22,349 --> 00:16:24,748
"I didn't want to bother
you. You looked so peaceful."

313
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:26,017
She'd drink all the milk

314
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:27,529
and return the empty
carton back in the fridge.

315
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:29,332
Then why are you all
red-eyed and puffy?

316
00:16:29,356 --> 00:16:31,822
We weren't soul mates. It
doesn't mean I wanted her dead.

317
00:16:44,603 --> 00:16:46,048
What's going on with the baby?

318
00:16:46,072 --> 00:16:47,438
Oh, nothing. He's fine.

319
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:49,185
They have him in
the nursery. Oh. Oh.

320
00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:50,819
I thought something
happened. No, no.

321
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:53,343
I paged you because I
wanted to let you know

322
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:57,331
that Callie and Sofia are
going to stay at my place tonight.

323
00:16:57,399 --> 00:17:00,951
I think she just needs some
space. She needs to cool off.

324
00:17:01,021 --> 00:17:02,731
And I know you're not gonna
go run over there or anything,

325
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:04,933
but I just thought
you would like to know

326
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:06,974
that she and the
baby are... Arizona.

327
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:09,193
Arizona?

328
00:17:11,764 --> 00:17:14,364
Is "I told you so"
inappropriate? Shut it.

329
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:20,187
Come on. What about Hassan?

330
00:17:20,256 --> 00:17:21,656
He's out at the pile, too?

331
00:17:21,724 --> 00:17:23,702
You realize they can't
all be out at the damn pile.

332
00:17:23,726 --> 00:17:25,203
No, I don't care
what religion they are.

333
00:17:25,227 --> 00:17:28,040
Just give me somebody,
anybody that can officiate this.

334
00:17:28,064 --> 00:17:29,708
Yeah, as a member of
the board, I'm gonna say

335
00:17:29,732 --> 00:17:31,276
you want to stay
away from phrases like,

336
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,568
"Even a Catholic."

337
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:35,202
Yeah.

338
00:17:35,271 --> 00:17:37,049
All right, uh,
just call me back.

339
00:17:38,441 --> 00:17:40,374
How is Richard?

340
00:17:40,443 --> 00:17:43,076
Hanging by a thread.
Thank you very much.

341
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:44,657
You're gonna scream
at me, too, now?

342
00:17:44,681 --> 00:17:46,459
I heard you already had
a go at Hunt and Bailey.

343
00:17:46,483 --> 00:17:48,627
I just wanna know what in God's
name was going on through your head...

344
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:50,534
Stop!

345
00:17:50,603 --> 00:17:53,370
You are terrified. I get that.

346
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:54,616
You love him.

347
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,819
And you are as scared
as you have ever been.

348
00:17:56,843 --> 00:17:58,125
Marching through this hospital

349
00:17:58,193 --> 00:17:59,505
telling everybody
they are incompetent

350
00:17:59,529 --> 00:18:01,590
is not gonna fix that situation.

351
00:18:02,698 --> 00:18:05,283
We are all doing our best.

352
00:18:05,351 --> 00:18:08,686
And we are gonna
take good care of him.

353
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:11,538
And we are gonna
take good care of you.

354
00:18:12,492 --> 00:18:13,602
Okay?

355
00:18:13,626 --> 00:18:14,658
Oh.

356
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:20,598
As soon as he's stable...

357
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,917
Yeah. As soon as
the storm passes,

358
00:18:24,253 --> 00:18:26,888
I'm going to move
him to another hospital.

359
00:18:31,961 --> 00:18:34,639
<i>Visitor Carol Erdman
return to the admit desk.</i>

360
00:18:34,663 --> 00:18:36,742
<i>Visitor Carol Erdman
return to the admit desk.</i>

361
00:18:36,766 --> 00:18:39,133
I'm gonna do a
thoracotomy on Lydia.

362
00:18:39,202 --> 00:18:40,679
Just waiting for
an OR to open up.

363
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:42,536
Okay.

364
00:18:44,908 --> 00:18:47,408
So thanks for before.

365
00:18:48,361 --> 00:18:49,560
"Thanks"?

366
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:52,363
Are you gonna send a
card on pretty stationery?

367
00:18:52,432 --> 00:18:53,864
I'm just glad

368
00:18:53,933 --> 00:18:56,667
that we've given each
other a better last memory.

369
00:18:56,736 --> 00:18:58,552
Uh-huh.

370
00:19:00,923 --> 00:19:01,923
What?

371
00:19:03,176 --> 00:19:04,808
I don't know.

372
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:07,078
If we'd really
thought it through,

373
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,229
then for the last
time we'd have...

374
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:11,098
What?

375
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,467
Is he in there? I
can't see anything.

376
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:32,014
Keep your voices
down. She's sleeping.

377
00:19:32,038 --> 00:19:33,905
No, she's not.

378
00:19:33,973 --> 00:19:37,152
Oh, sorry, um, we were
just looking for Dr. Shepherd.

379
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,927
He's not here. He'll be back.
He went to take Zola home.

380
00:19:39,996 --> 00:19:41,078
What do you need?

381
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:46,028
He asked us to come up
with something nice to say

382
00:19:46,052 --> 00:19:48,285
about Heather to her
mom for after she knows.

383
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:51,672
We're having trouble coming up
with something that's appropriate.

384
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:53,285
We were thinking if we
looked at some of the cases

385
00:19:53,309 --> 00:19:56,005
she worked on with Dr. Shepherd,
we could talk about those.

386
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:59,763
Her mother is not gonna give
a crap about her glioblastoma.

387
00:19:59,832 --> 00:20:02,072
She wants to hear
about how you loved her

388
00:20:02,135 --> 00:20:04,375
and how she was
like your family.

389
00:20:06,589 --> 00:20:09,056
Nothing? Doesn't
have to be deep.

390
00:20:10,993 --> 00:20:13,171
When my friend George
died, I told his mother a story

391
00:20:13,195 --> 00:20:16,129
about how he stole
us all Jell-O cups.

392
00:20:16,216 --> 00:20:17,560
And then he dropped
them all over the floor

393
00:20:17,584 --> 00:20:19,450
and made a huge mess.

394
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:21,379
And then he tried to clean it
up with those blue bed pads,

395
00:20:21,403 --> 00:20:22,948
which only made it
worse because, of course,

396
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:26,040
those blue bed pads
aren't absorbent at all.

397
00:20:26,109 --> 00:20:29,976
It's not a sonnet,
but it made her smile.

398
00:20:30,045 --> 00:20:32,205
And then she
went back to crying.

399
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,432
Okay.

400
00:20:40,372 --> 00:20:42,272
Asleep? What do you think?

401
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:44,135
My mother's planning on moving
Richard to another hospital.

402
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,409
What? I know.

403
00:20:45,478 --> 00:20:47,038
I know you weren't
sure about how to handle

404
00:20:47,062 --> 00:20:49,074
Richard's medical decisions,
but I'm just telling you,

405
00:20:49,098 --> 00:20:50,375
you turn the reins over to her,

406
00:20:50,399 --> 00:20:51,793
that's exactly what
she's gonna do with it.

407
00:20:51,817 --> 00:20:54,318
Okay. Get me a wheelchair.

408
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:56,670
You just had a
splenectomy and a child.

409
00:20:56,739 --> 00:20:58,016
I'm not putting
you in a wheelchair.

410
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,057
Jackson, just get
me a wheelchair.

411
00:21:00,126 --> 00:21:01,470
There are no chaplains
anywhere in the building.

412
00:21:01,494 --> 00:21:03,254
Everyone is out dealing
with storm victims.

413
00:21:03,296 --> 00:21:04,839
We have storm
victims right here.

414
00:21:04,863 --> 00:21:07,665
What... Chaplains are
supposed to stay here!

415
00:21:07,734 --> 00:21:09,627
Anybody seen my patient Brian?

416
00:21:09,651 --> 00:21:11,719
Firefighter, busted ribs.

417
00:21:11,787 --> 00:21:13,053
Yeah, he's getting married.

418
00:21:13,121 --> 00:21:14,416
Not without a
chaplain, he's not.

419
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,273
Well, I can go online
and get certified

420
00:21:16,342 --> 00:21:18,943
by that place on the Internet,
but me and weddings, today,

421
00:21:19,012 --> 00:21:22,028
I don't think that
I'm the best choice.

422
00:21:24,883 --> 00:21:27,318
The damn firefighters
keep taking off, injured.

423
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:31,772
If you see any of them, tell
them to stay in their damn beds.

424
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,390
Kepner. What?

425
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:34,608
Get me a wheelchair.

426
00:21:34,677 --> 00:21:36,911
Uh... April!

427
00:21:36,979 --> 00:21:38,957
I don't think we can be friends.

428
00:21:38,981 --> 00:21:40,447
Really?

429
00:21:40,516 --> 00:21:41,593
Mm-mmm.

430
00:21:41,617 --> 00:21:43,483
This will keep happening.

431
00:21:43,553 --> 00:21:47,220
Yeah. I really wanted to
be able to work with you.

432
00:21:47,289 --> 00:21:50,223
Yeah, of course.

433
00:21:50,292 --> 00:21:51,759
But if we, you know,

434
00:21:51,827 --> 00:21:53,694
talk on the phone

435
00:21:54,463 --> 00:21:56,229
or grab lunch...

436
00:22:04,674 --> 00:22:08,609
Just because I'm the
one who said it was time,

437
00:22:09,812 --> 00:22:12,012
doesn't mean
this is easy for me.

438
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:15,749
I know.

439
00:22:19,288 --> 00:22:21,755
This is not easy for me.

440
00:22:26,328 --> 00:22:28,328
Hey, hey.

441
00:22:32,702 --> 00:22:35,836
What do you really believe is
the best course of treatment?

442
00:22:35,904 --> 00:22:37,504
It's not that simple.

443
00:22:37,573 --> 00:22:39,373
Yes, it is.

444
00:22:39,442 --> 00:22:42,843
You always taught us,
when you know, you know.

445
00:22:48,517 --> 00:22:51,185
I think there is
something in there,

446
00:22:51,254 --> 00:22:54,088
and no matter how
much it stresses his heart,

447
00:22:54,157 --> 00:22:58,325
I think letting it
get worse is worse.

448
00:23:10,857 --> 00:23:13,557
Hi. This is Dr. Grey.

449
00:23:13,626 --> 00:23:18,679
I need to book an OR for
an exploratory laparotomy.

450
00:23:18,765 --> 00:23:20,163
Surgeon is Bailey.

451
00:23:21,701 --> 00:23:23,867
Patient is Webber.

452
00:23:33,212 --> 00:23:34,732
Oh, they're opening
him up again.

453
00:23:34,781 --> 00:23:37,164
Yup. Don't say
anything. I'm not.

454
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:39,349
She thought it was a
stupid idea the first time

455
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:41,663
and even more
stupid the second time.

456
00:23:41,687 --> 00:23:42,914
You're the one who has to decide

457
00:23:42,938 --> 00:23:44,282
what Richard would want.
Wouldn't want to be you.

458
00:23:44,306 --> 00:23:46,039
Thanks. But to be clear,

459
00:23:46,125 --> 00:23:47,519
when you're making
these decisions for me,

460
00:23:47,543 --> 00:23:50,210
give my heart at least
24 hours to recover

461
00:23:50,279 --> 00:23:51,740
before you cut me stem to stern.

462
00:23:51,764 --> 00:23:53,475
You just couldn't
hold it in, could you?

463
00:23:53,499 --> 00:23:55,744
Wait, she's your
health care proxy?

464
00:23:55,768 --> 00:23:57,868
I get to make the
decisions for everyone.

465
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,019
Not Owen?

466
00:23:59,088 --> 00:24:00,103
No.

467
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:01,972
Who's yours?

468
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,318
Oh, I never filled
out the forms.

469
00:24:03,342 --> 00:24:04,920
I had the papers back
when it was gonna be Izzie.

470
00:24:04,944 --> 00:24:06,159
Ooh. That was a bad plan.

471
00:24:06,228 --> 00:24:07,361
That was all a bad plan.

472
00:24:07,429 --> 00:24:08,674
Why do you think I
never turned them in?

473
00:24:08,698 --> 00:24:10,080
Well, Mer could be yours, too.

474
00:24:10,149 --> 00:24:12,261
You think I make the
wrong decisions all the time.

475
00:24:12,285 --> 00:24:13,529
I don't know why
you're selling me to him.

476
00:24:13,553 --> 00:24:15,214
Will you stop being so insecure?

477
00:24:15,238 --> 00:24:16,958
Just because I disagree with you

478
00:24:17,023 --> 00:24:18,416
doesn't mean I don't
respect what you think.

479
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,858
I can hold more than one
point of view in my mind.

480
00:24:20,927 --> 00:24:22,593
I am mature.

481
00:24:22,662 --> 00:24:24,502
I don't believe you.

482
00:24:25,897 --> 00:24:26,913
Hmm.

483
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:29,182
You can be mine.

484
00:24:29,251 --> 00:24:30,984
Health care proxy? Really?

485
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:32,953
I mean, Mer's got
enough to take care of.

486
00:24:33,021 --> 00:24:34,766
You want extraordinary measures
or should I just unplug you?

487
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:36,257
Use your judgment.

488
00:24:36,325 --> 00:24:38,325
Hmm... Uh-oh.

489
00:24:39,295 --> 00:24:40,535
Sharpie lady's ready.

490
00:24:44,216 --> 00:24:45,382
Mom!

491
00:24:45,451 --> 00:24:47,371
You knew they were
taking him back into the OR?

492
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:48,963
Right, now you can't march
in there and shut 'em down.

493
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:51,504
The hell I can't. Hey!

494
00:24:51,574 --> 00:24:53,791
He didn't choose you
to make his decisions.

495
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:55,739
He chose Meredith.

496
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:00,608
How's the ER?
Ugh, quiet for a while.

497
00:25:00,632 --> 00:25:02,672
But we got a couple of
ambulances on their way in,

498
00:25:02,717 --> 00:25:04,885
people they pulled
out of the pile.

499
00:25:04,954 --> 00:25:07,215
Can I come? No, no. You're
supposed to be working.

500
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:08,479
I don't need the night off.

501
00:25:10,443 --> 00:25:13,488
We're supposed to be sitting
around telling Heather stories.

502
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:15,941
Turns out we're not a very
tight group. You think you're not.

503
00:25:15,965 --> 00:25:18,932
But when it all hits the fan,
you'll be glad you have 'em.

504
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:21,138
Someone just died.
Shouldn't this be the time?

505
00:25:21,187 --> 00:25:22,653
Oh, come on.

506
00:25:22,721 --> 00:25:24,616
You're not gonna go cry
to them when we break up

507
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,952
and you have to move your trash
bag full of crap out of my house?

508
00:25:26,976 --> 00:25:29,943
Okay, one,

509
00:25:30,012 --> 00:25:32,790
I never leave more than a change
of underwear and a toothbrush

510
00:25:32,814 --> 00:25:34,543
in anyone else's
house. That's smart.

511
00:25:34,567 --> 00:25:36,900
And two, I will have
dumped your sorry ass,

512
00:25:36,969 --> 00:25:38,647
so I'm not gonna be crying.
I'm just gonna feel bad

513
00:25:38,671 --> 00:25:40,114
that I made it so you
can never love again.

514
00:25:40,138 --> 00:25:42,800
Oh, yeah. It's gonna
be ugly. Mmm-hmm.

515
00:25:42,824 --> 00:25:46,860
But see, I've got Mer and
Cristina. I can cry to them.

516
00:25:46,928 --> 00:25:49,288
When the next guy after
me breaks your heart...

517
00:25:49,331 --> 00:25:50,947
I'm gonna want my bitches.

518
00:25:52,151 --> 00:25:53,183
<i>Voila.</i>

519
00:25:53,252 --> 00:25:54,267
This, it'll help.

520
00:25:55,121 --> 00:25:56,287
Hmm.

521
00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:00,440
Brian and Sasha,

522
00:26:00,509 --> 00:26:05,662
your commitment to
each other is an inspiration.

523
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:09,365
Your love, your
devotion, it's unwavering.

524
00:26:10,853 --> 00:26:14,888
You aren't swayed by anything
that life puts in your path.

525
00:26:16,692 --> 00:26:19,559
When people talk about marriage,

526
00:26:19,628 --> 00:26:22,245
this is exactly what they
ought to have in mind.

527
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:27,634
I can't believe I
yelled at a woman

528
00:26:27,703 --> 00:26:29,803
who clawed dying
victims out of the mud

529
00:26:29,872 --> 00:26:32,305
and triaged them with
her bleeding little hands.

530
00:26:32,375 --> 00:26:33,741
Super tacky.

531
00:26:33,809 --> 00:26:35,729
I think I'm the worst
person I've ever met.

532
00:26:35,778 --> 00:26:37,711
Shut up.

533
00:26:38,381 --> 00:26:39,713
Mmm.

534
00:26:40,816 --> 00:26:41,882
It speaks.

535
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:46,030
It wants more booze. All right.

536
00:26:46,054 --> 00:26:48,216
All right, we all have to focus.

537
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,973
Heather.

538
00:26:50,042 --> 00:26:53,376
She was a fine, upstanding
citizen with limitless potential.

539
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:54,856
You say that to my
mom when I'm dead,

540
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,357
and she's gonna
know you're lying.

541
00:26:56,381 --> 00:26:58,226
My mom will believe it. You
can say it when I'm dead.

542
00:26:58,250 --> 00:26:59,883
Write it down 'cause
I'm gonna forget.

543
00:26:59,935 --> 00:27:01,735
That I was a nice person?

544
00:27:01,804 --> 00:27:03,737
How is it that we spend
this much time together

545
00:27:03,806 --> 00:27:05,183
and we don't really know
anything about each other?

546
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:06,634
So tell us something
we don't know.

547
00:27:06,658 --> 00:27:08,378
About me? Mm-hmm. Don't be shy.

548
00:27:09,629 --> 00:27:10,661
What?

549
00:27:12,348 --> 00:27:13,614
I can't.

550
00:27:13,682 --> 00:27:14,976
You guys are gonna hate
me more than you already do.

551
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,669
No, we won't. Circle of trust.

552
00:27:22,824 --> 00:27:24,324
My mom knew Mark Sloan.

553
00:27:24,393 --> 00:27:26,760
The one who died?

554
00:27:26,829 --> 00:27:30,931
They, like, dated a hundred
years ago or something.

555
00:27:30,999 --> 00:27:32,794
And he kind of helped
me get into the program.

556
00:27:32,818 --> 00:27:33,983
What?

557
00:27:34,052 --> 00:27:35,352
Oh, I knew it.

558
00:27:35,421 --> 00:27:36,665
I knew you didn't make
it in here on your own.

559
00:27:36,689 --> 00:27:38,155
You are such an evil cow.

560
00:27:38,223 --> 00:27:40,952
Whatever. At least I got
in here on my own merit.

561
00:27:40,976 --> 00:27:43,737
What happened to the circle
of trust? I was a street kid.

562
00:27:44,796 --> 00:27:47,681
Foster homes, lived in my car.

563
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:49,866
You were not. Hand to God.

564
00:27:49,935 --> 00:27:51,713
Really? Do you know
how to pickpocket?

565
00:27:51,737 --> 00:27:54,154
No. I wasn't Oliver Twist.

566
00:27:54,222 --> 00:27:55,884
Could you teach me
how to shoplift? No!

567
00:27:55,908 --> 00:27:58,675
It'll help me in the OR.
Calm hands under pressure.

568
00:27:58,744 --> 00:28:00,355
You couldn't
handle it. You could.

569
00:28:00,379 --> 00:28:01,979
Thank you. Mmm.

570
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:04,110
I went through college on
a cheerleading scholarship.

571
00:28:05,217 --> 00:28:07,117
What? JO: No!

572
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:08,786
Yes.

573
00:28:09,571 --> 00:28:10,870
That is my child!

574
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:12,917
Okay, so I can screw
some whore on shore leave,

575
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:14,119
but this is over the line?

576
00:28:14,143 --> 00:28:15,720
Hey, I could have
called the police on you.

577
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:17,422
Okay, and now she's your baby.

578
00:28:17,446 --> 00:28:19,926
I had to talk you into even
considering having a child.

579
00:28:19,982 --> 00:28:21,915
And I had to talk
you into marriage.

580
00:28:21,984 --> 00:28:23,795
Yeah, because I knew
it would be a mistake.

581
00:28:23,819 --> 00:28:25,363
And you know what? It was.

582
00:28:25,387 --> 00:28:26,965
You cannot take a
baby and just disappear...

583
00:28:26,989 --> 00:28:28,900
Oh, look at the stars
and the sky light.

584
00:28:28,924 --> 00:28:30,257
Yeah? Yeah, should we go...

585
00:28:30,326 --> 00:28:32,036
Let's go to the swing.
Should we go to the swing?

586
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:33,238
Okay. Go to the swing.

587
00:28:33,262 --> 00:28:34,862
Go to the swing.
Let's go to the swing.

588
00:28:34,914 --> 00:28:37,915
We are excited, united,

589
00:28:37,983 --> 00:28:39,482
and here to win the fight.

590
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:42,101
We're here to meet
you, defeat you,

591
00:28:42,171 --> 00:28:44,571
we dominate tonight! Ow!

592
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,639
Tigers.

593
00:28:46,726 --> 00:28:48,658
Tigers. Mmm.

594
00:28:48,728 --> 00:28:50,072
Tigers. JO: Whoo!

595
00:28:50,096 --> 00:28:51,156
Oh. Tigers.

596
00:28:52,898 --> 00:28:54,447
Tigers.

597
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,232
Excuse me,

598
00:28:56,301 --> 00:28:57,529
somebody said you might be able

599
00:28:57,553 --> 00:28:59,353
to help me find my daughter,

600
00:28:59,438 --> 00:29:00,503
Heather Brooks.

601
00:29:08,814 --> 00:29:10,726
We have run this
bowel four times now,

602
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:12,216
and there is nothing there.

603
00:29:12,284 --> 00:29:14,262
I don't know how much
longer we can keep at this.

604
00:29:14,286 --> 00:29:17,537
Come on. I know you're in there.

605
00:29:19,724 --> 00:29:20,774
Owen.

606
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:26,079
Oh, my God. The pancreas.

607
00:29:26,147 --> 00:29:27,480
Look at that.

608
00:29:27,549 --> 00:29:30,783
That's all necrotic
tissue hiding underneath.

609
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:32,486
Get her some forceps, please.

610
00:29:32,554 --> 00:29:34,120
And a 15-blade.

611
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:35,538
Here you go, Doctor.

612
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:37,619
Hey, somebody call
Meredith Grey up in maternity.

613
00:29:37,643 --> 00:29:40,543
On it. Tell her, "When
you know, you know"!

614
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:01,782
It was a beautiful wedding.

615
00:30:03,318 --> 00:30:04,796
What you said... Can we not?

616
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:06,986
Why are you
snapping at me all day?

617
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:09,200
I'm not snapping. Yeah, you are.

618
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:10,890
I'm sorry I asked the question.

619
00:30:10,959 --> 00:30:13,910
It obviously made you
really uncomfortable,

620
00:30:13,979 --> 00:30:16,146
and I guess that's my answer.

621
00:30:16,215 --> 00:30:17,708
There's no need to
beat a dead horse.

622
00:30:17,732 --> 00:30:19,983
That's what it's supposed
to look like, you know.

623
00:30:20,051 --> 00:30:22,971
I mean, they can't even
imagine not being together.

624
00:30:23,037 --> 00:30:24,449
Do you see the
difference between that

625
00:30:24,473 --> 00:30:25,850
and "I think I'll
marry this guy,

626
00:30:25,874 --> 00:30:28,224
"or maybe I'll marry that guy,
who I banged in a bathroom

627
00:30:28,293 --> 00:30:29,671
"because I flipped
out over my boards,

628
00:30:29,695 --> 00:30:31,322
"but when he was into
me, I couldn't handle it.

629
00:30:31,346 --> 00:30:33,258
"But suddenly, when he almost
dies, I can't live without him."

630
00:30:33,282 --> 00:30:35,566
That is so unfair!

631
00:30:35,618 --> 00:30:37,433
It's what happened!

632
00:30:37,503 --> 00:30:40,965
You didn't want me when I
was okay, when I wanted you.

633
00:30:40,989 --> 00:30:42,656
No, you just want me now

634
00:30:42,725 --> 00:30:46,226
because you are in
something that is real. And that,

635
00:30:46,295 --> 00:30:48,173
that scares the crap out of you.

636
00:30:48,197 --> 00:30:50,041
Marry this guy because you
want to make a life with him,

637
00:30:50,065 --> 00:30:52,566
or don't, and move on.

638
00:30:52,634 --> 00:30:54,879
But none of this
has to do with me.

639
00:30:54,903 --> 00:30:58,454
No, this is entirely about you.

640
00:31:49,023 --> 00:31:52,109
I'm very sorry about how
I spoke to you yesterday.

641
00:31:52,177 --> 00:31:55,829
With the storm and
everything, and we're all just...

642
00:32:01,886 --> 00:32:03,126
Your house...

643
00:32:05,206 --> 00:32:06,723
It didn't make it, did it?

644
00:32:06,792 --> 00:32:08,792
I'm sorry.

645
00:32:12,564 --> 00:32:15,932
You saved a lot of
people triaging like you did.

646
00:32:16,001 --> 00:32:17,645
Were you a doctor or something?

647
00:32:17,669 --> 00:32:21,537
No, I've just lived on the side
of the mountain for a long time.

648
00:32:21,607 --> 00:32:25,742
It's not our first storm.

649
00:32:25,811 --> 00:32:31,531
An ex-marine showed me
how to do it our first mudslide.

650
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,367
Oh, I can't believe I have
to build that house again.

651
00:32:34,436 --> 00:32:36,897
Ugh. Maybe you should
find someplace else.

652
00:32:36,921 --> 00:32:38,171
No.

653
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:42,308
We're a few houses on
the side of a mountain,

654
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:44,127
and we take care of each other.

655
00:32:50,035 --> 00:32:52,953
I'm sure you'd find new friends.

656
00:32:55,524 --> 00:32:58,691
No one else would have me.

657
00:33:13,125 --> 00:33:14,841
She was really good.

658
00:33:17,211 --> 00:33:18,812
Fast hands.

659
00:33:23,735 --> 00:33:26,335
One time,

660
00:33:26,404 --> 00:33:31,675
we'd all been working all
night, and we were starving,

661
00:33:31,743 --> 00:33:36,479
and she went to where they
make the food trays for the patients,

662
00:33:36,548 --> 00:33:39,549
and she stole Jell-O
cups for all of us.

663
00:33:39,617 --> 00:33:42,652
And they fell
all over the floor.

664
00:33:42,721 --> 00:33:45,588
She tried to use one of
those blue hospital pads

665
00:33:45,657 --> 00:33:48,441
to clean it up, but it
just made it worse.

666
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:50,427
Got everywhere.

667
00:33:50,495 --> 00:33:51,761
Jo told Heather that

668
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:53,941
she swiped an apple
from a grocery store

669
00:33:53,965 --> 00:33:55,364
when she was a kid.

670
00:33:55,433 --> 00:33:59,352
And Heather asked her
to teach her how to shoplift.

671
00:33:59,421 --> 00:34:02,741
She thought it would
improve her surgical technique.

672
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,767
You must have been close.

673
00:34:21,176 --> 00:34:24,172
April, I really don't have
time for this. Please just...

674
00:34:24,196 --> 00:34:26,196
Please.

675
00:34:29,551 --> 00:34:32,251
I want to accept your proposal.

676
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:36,005
In private, without anybody
pressuring me to say yes.

677
00:34:36,057 --> 00:34:39,091
And I want to do
it in front of God.

678
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,338
Actually, no, you know what? No.

679
00:34:41,362 --> 00:34:45,615
I'm not accepting your
proposal, I am proposing to you.

680
00:34:45,684 --> 00:34:47,484
I want to be your wife.

681
00:34:49,054 --> 00:34:51,188
I think you need to
think some stuff out.

682
00:34:51,256 --> 00:34:52,789
I did.

683
00:34:57,179 --> 00:35:01,247
Okay. Yes, it was Jackson.

684
00:35:01,315 --> 00:35:05,051
And, yes, I have
feelings for him.

685
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:07,148
He's always gonna
be a part of my life.

686
00:35:07,172 --> 00:35:09,200
And that gets
confusing sometimes,

687
00:35:09,224 --> 00:35:11,744
especially when he's pulling
babies out of burning buses, but...

688
00:35:14,879 --> 00:35:17,731
I'm not good at this.
This is all new to me.

689
00:35:17,799 --> 00:35:20,110
Okay, I was never the girl
that got picked at the dance.

690
00:35:20,134 --> 00:35:22,497
I'm not good at it.
And I'm indecisive

691
00:35:22,521 --> 00:35:24,721
because I see eight
sides of everything.

692
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:27,335
And that's what you're
picking when you pick me.

693
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:29,225
And you may not want that.

694
00:35:29,294 --> 00:35:30,971
I thought maybe nobody
would ever want that.

695
00:35:30,995 --> 00:35:33,746
April... But I want you.

696
00:35:35,316 --> 00:35:36,883
I want to marry you.

697
00:35:39,237 --> 00:35:41,688
So will you marry me?

698
00:35:52,518 --> 00:35:55,936
Sofia is downstairs
in the day care.

699
00:35:56,004 --> 00:35:57,415
I'm sorry I called
you a baby-snatcher.

700
00:35:57,439 --> 00:36:00,040
I was upset, and I shouldn't
have spoken to you like that.

701
00:36:00,108 --> 00:36:01,319
You were just
trying to cool off,

702
00:36:01,343 --> 00:36:02,520
and that was the
right thing to do...

703
00:36:02,544 --> 00:36:04,172
Sofia and I will be staying
at Mer's again tonight.

704
00:36:04,196 --> 00:36:05,806
That'll be two nights with me.

705
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,441
You can take her the
following two nights.

706
00:36:07,465 --> 00:36:11,401
And we'll switch off like that until
we can figure out a real schedule.

707
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:13,969
Well, how long is this
gonna be going on?

708
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:17,490
I don't know.

709
00:36:27,001 --> 00:36:30,403
Dr. Ben Warren,
this is your wife.

710
00:36:30,472 --> 00:36:34,039
Sorry, I keep
missing you. It's...

711
00:36:34,108 --> 00:36:35,941
It's been...

712
00:36:37,178 --> 00:36:38,478
Um...

713
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:45,518
Something happened with Richard,

714
00:36:45,587 --> 00:36:48,954
a health situation.

715
00:36:49,023 --> 00:36:52,091
I got involved in that.

716
00:36:54,061 --> 00:36:57,897
Uh, he's still unconscious.

717
00:36:57,965 --> 00:37:00,199
I don't know how
he's going to...

718
00:37:01,736 --> 00:37:03,369
But he's alive.

719
00:37:19,454 --> 00:37:20,934
Hey.

720
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:23,857
Heather's uncle just arrived.

721
00:37:23,925 --> 00:37:26,042
He's with her mom, and
her brother's on his way.

722
00:37:26,111 --> 00:37:28,678
Thank you for staying with her.

723
00:37:28,747 --> 00:37:31,831
Go home. Get some rest.

724
00:37:31,899 --> 00:37:35,129
You need to tell your guys to stop going
out to the damn pile if they're injured.

725
00:37:35,153 --> 00:37:37,048
I keep patching up
the same damn guys.

726
00:37:37,072 --> 00:37:39,923
I could tell 'em, but it's not
gonna make any difference.

727
00:37:39,992 --> 00:37:42,726
They can't just sit around.
It makes them nuts.

728
00:37:42,794 --> 00:37:44,711
All right, try harder!

729
00:37:44,779 --> 00:37:46,379
Where's the rig?

730
00:37:46,447 --> 00:37:48,715
You okay? You sure?

731
00:37:48,783 --> 00:37:50,116
Okay. Out back.

732
00:37:53,722 --> 00:37:54,838
Hey, sir?

733
00:37:56,091 --> 00:37:57,201
Can I ride out
there with you guys?

734
00:37:57,225 --> 00:37:58,225
Sure.

735
00:37:58,310 --> 00:37:59,409
What are you doing?

736
00:37:59,477 --> 00:38:00,677
Shane!

737
00:38:00,745 --> 00:38:03,313
Shane, you're not
a firefighter! Shane!

738
00:38:05,149 --> 00:38:07,483
Stupid.

739
00:38:07,552 --> 00:38:08,685
Damn it.

740
00:38:08,753 --> 00:38:10,403
What are you doing?

741
00:38:10,472 --> 00:38:11,966
We're his people. We have to go.

742
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:13,551
Uh, actually, no, we
don't. We're not trained...

743
00:38:13,575 --> 00:38:15,024
Sharpie lady helped.

744
00:38:15,093 --> 00:38:17,639
Sharpie lady almost got
herself killed. We have to go.

745
00:38:17,663 --> 00:38:19,607
I don't know what the deal
is with him and Heather.

746
00:38:19,631 --> 00:38:21,342
I don't know if it's their
weird competition thing.

747
00:38:21,366 --> 00:38:22,993
Or maybe they were having
secret sex in the bathrooms.

748
00:38:23,017 --> 00:38:24,361
I don't care. Whatever it is,

749
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:26,697
Shane hasn't said a
single word since she died,

750
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:29,739
and we're what he has.
We're what we have.

751
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:32,019
Maybe we get through
this program normal.

752
00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:35,678
Or maybe we end up
cranky, work-obsessed people

753
00:38:35,747 --> 00:38:37,025
who live on the
side of a mountain

754
00:38:37,049 --> 00:38:38,976
and have no family or children,

755
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,468
and we only have each other
because no one else can stand us.

756
00:38:42,537 --> 00:38:44,457
What is she talking... Get up!

757
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:08,461
Hey. Everything okay?

758
00:39:08,546 --> 00:39:12,548
Yeah, uh, Meredith just wants
me to hang out at her house.

759
00:39:12,617 --> 00:39:16,919
Zola needs some attention.
And Derek is pretty wiped out.

760
00:39:16,988 --> 00:39:18,499
Callie and Sofia
are there, so...

761
00:39:18,523 --> 00:39:21,457
Is there anything I can
do? I mean, I could, uh...

762
00:39:24,846 --> 00:39:27,263
Good night.

763
00:39:27,331 --> 00:39:28,664
Yeah.

764
00:39:33,321 --> 00:39:36,789
Zola is asleep.

765
00:39:36,858 --> 00:39:38,358
All right, little miss.

766
00:39:38,426 --> 00:39:39,603
In five minutes, it's your turn.

767
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:42,328
To be clear, I am
happy to do the dishes,

768
00:39:42,397 --> 00:39:44,630
but there is no universe
in which I generate dinner.

769
00:39:44,716 --> 00:39:46,949
All right, we'll figure it out.

770
00:39:47,018 --> 00:39:48,134
Mac and cheese.

771
00:39:48,203 --> 00:39:49,697
Oh, no, we had that last night.

772
00:39:49,721 --> 00:39:51,971
Well, and it was good.
Right? It was good.

773
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,800
Oh, thank you.

774
00:39:56,027 --> 00:39:58,961
HI. Um, I'm sorry
to bother everybody.

775
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:00,846
No, it's okay.

776
00:40:00,915 --> 00:40:02,493
Can I see her for just a minute?

777
00:40:02,517 --> 00:40:04,379
You saw her this afternoon.
You can get her tomorrow night.

778
00:40:04,403 --> 00:40:07,504
I know. Um, but...

779
00:40:07,572 --> 00:40:09,773
You can see her
when it's your night.

780
00:40:09,841 --> 00:40:14,227
I could, uh, just take her on the front porch
for a minute, and I'm not gonna take her.

781
00:40:14,295 --> 00:40:17,497
Do you have any idea how
confusing this is for her?

782
00:40:21,219 --> 00:40:23,452
Yeah, I realize that.

783
00:40:23,505 --> 00:40:25,549
Well, you know what? She's
supposed to be in bed right now.

784
00:40:25,573 --> 00:40:27,935
How am I supposed to get her to
sleep with you coming and going?

785
00:40:27,959 --> 00:40:29,670
Five minutes. Are
you kidding me?

786
00:40:29,694 --> 00:40:30,988
She shows up here with this act,

787
00:40:31,012 --> 00:40:32,289
and you're just
gonna take her side?

788
00:40:32,313 --> 00:40:33,574
It's an act. Callie, look at me.

789
00:40:33,598 --> 00:40:35,364
I'm your friend.

790
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:36,816
Five minutes.

791
00:40:40,538 --> 00:40:44,741
Come here, Sofia. Come
here, baby. Okay. Yeah.

792
00:40:44,809 --> 00:40:47,710
<i>We just want to
survive the storm.</i>

793
00:40:47,779 --> 00:40:50,412
I missed you so much.

794
00:40:50,482 --> 00:40:53,749
<i>We pray, "Please, God,</i>

795
00:40:53,818 --> 00:40:57,403
<i>"just get me to the other side."</i>

796
00:40:57,472 --> 00:41:00,539
<i>We never imagine what
it'll be like when we get there.</i>

797
00:41:00,608 --> 00:41:03,142
I love you so much.

798
00:41:04,779 --> 00:41:08,414
And I miss you every second.

799
00:41:08,483 --> 00:41:10,216
'Cause you're my girl.

800
00:41:10,285 --> 00:41:15,188
<i>What if when the storm
passes, nothing's left?</i>

801
00:41:15,257 --> 00:41:18,291
<i>I always said I could
handle anything.</i>

802
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,893
<i>I was wrong.</i>

803
00:41:19,961 --> 00:41:21,873
<i>I was wrong about
a lot of things.</i>

804
00:41:21,897 --> 00:41:23,875
I think there's no harm
in getting another opinion.

805
00:41:23,899 --> 00:41:25,698
Was I or was I not correct?

806
00:41:25,767 --> 00:41:28,201
Why does that make
you feel so threatened?

807
00:41:28,270 --> 00:41:30,970
I'm another opinion,
and I have to tip my hat.

808
00:41:31,039 --> 00:41:32,305
Dr. Bailey called it.

809
00:41:32,374 --> 00:41:34,874
Nobody said it wasn't good
to deal with the pancreas,

810
00:41:34,943 --> 00:41:37,109
but he is still
clearly unstable.

811
00:41:37,195 --> 00:41:38,656
He hasn't regained
consciousness...

812
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:40,379
None of that is unusual.

813
00:41:40,448 --> 00:41:43,833
I would like to bring in another
person, somebody that could tell us...

814
00:41:43,902 --> 00:41:46,168
I will make the decision.

815
00:41:46,237 --> 00:41:48,683
You've said what you think,
and then you said it again.

816
00:41:48,707 --> 00:41:50,151
And I will take that
under advisement.

817
00:41:50,175 --> 00:41:51,175
Dr. Grey...

818
00:41:51,226 --> 00:41:52,937
He picked you
to be his girlfriend.

819
00:41:52,961 --> 00:41:54,571
And we're all very
happy about that.

820
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:56,524
But he picked me
to be his family.

821
00:41:56,548 --> 00:41:59,982
And you walked away from that
responsibility the second that...

822
00:42:00,051 --> 00:42:02,235
No one said I
would be good at it.

823
00:42:02,303 --> 00:42:06,288
And he knew that. But
he picked me anyway.

824
00:42:06,341 --> 00:42:08,657
I'm the family. Meredith.

825
00:42:08,726 --> 00:42:11,477
Please, don't get involved.

826
00:42:11,545 --> 00:42:15,014
<i>But I was right about one thing.</i>

827
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:16,849
Hi.

828
00:42:16,918 --> 00:42:18,818
<i>I was right about this.</i>
