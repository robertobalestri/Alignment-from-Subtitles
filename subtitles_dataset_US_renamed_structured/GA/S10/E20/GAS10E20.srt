1
00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:10,025
<i>Surgery is a solo act.</i>

2
00:00:10,094 --> 00:00:11,337
Are you sure you don't
want help with that?

3
00:00:11,361 --> 00:00:12,361
I got it.

4
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:14,279
Come on. Come on.

5
00:00:14,348 --> 00:00:16,375
<i>We step up to the table
with a scalpel in our hand,</i>

6
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:17,533
<i>and we go it alone.</i>

7
00:00:17,601 --> 00:00:18,978
You written your speech yet?

8
00:00:19,002 --> 00:00:20,714
Uh, no, not yet. Mer and I
are going out for drinks tonight,

9
00:00:20,738 --> 00:00:21,978
and she's gonna help me.

10
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:24,189
<i>The isolation can
start to define you.</i>

11
00:00:24,257 --> 00:00:26,536
<i>Because even though
you're surrounded by a team...</i>

12
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:31,629
So, vodka is writing your
Harper Avery acceptance speech?

13
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:33,782
Tequila.

14
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:36,680
<i>What it really comes down to
is your training, your choices,</i>

15
00:00:36,704 --> 00:00:39,755
<i>your wits, your
hands, your stitch.</i>

16
00:00:39,824 --> 00:00:40,824
I'm coming.

17
00:00:42,025 --> 00:00:43,436
To Joe's? You're working.

18
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,210
No, to Boston. Tomorrow.

19
00:00:45,278 --> 00:00:47,312
We can make a
night of it, you know?

20
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:50,381
Champagne. Room service.

21
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:53,763
I'm flying out in the morning,

22
00:00:53,787 --> 00:00:56,888
I'm going to the ceremony, and
then flying back on the red-eye.

23
00:00:56,957 --> 00:00:58,618
I'll be gone less than 24 hours.

24
00:00:58,642 --> 00:01:00,709
Cristina, this is the
biggest day of your life.

25
00:01:00,778 --> 00:01:02,410
Did you get a haircut?

26
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:04,112
Uh, you're changing the subject.

27
00:01:04,181 --> 00:01:05,747
Yep.

28
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:07,749
<i>It comes down to just you.</i>

29
00:01:07,818 --> 00:01:09,996
It's been two full weeks
of the night shift, Alex.

30
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,197
How long can you
keep doing this?

31
00:01:11,221 --> 00:01:12,298
Well, I haven't dropped yet.

32
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:13,499
Well, when you
gonna tell Robbins?

33
00:01:13,523 --> 00:01:14,622
When do I have a chance?

34
00:01:14,692 --> 00:01:16,224
I'm doing surgery 24 hours a day

35
00:01:16,293 --> 00:01:18,226
with a dozen 20-minute
naps in between.

36
00:01:18,295 --> 00:01:21,196
You're like a double agent.
It's actually pretty sexy.

37
00:01:21,264 --> 00:01:22,564
Hey, Robbins.

38
00:01:22,632 --> 00:01:24,143
Uh, back away,
Karev. She's off duty.

39
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:25,595
I was gonna say you
look nice, but whatever.

40
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:27,469
Aw, thank you. It's date night.

41
00:01:27,538 --> 00:01:30,333
Yeah, listen, we've been on
opposite schedules for weeks,

42
00:01:30,357 --> 00:01:33,370
so if we don't take the time to
sit down and eat a meal together

43
00:01:33,394 --> 00:01:34,887
and remember why
we chose to be married,

44
00:01:34,911 --> 00:01:36,428
we will kill each other.

45
00:01:36,497 --> 00:01:38,208
No sweat. I've got
everything handled.

46
00:01:38,232 --> 00:01:40,592
Enjoy your night. Thank you.

47
00:01:41,869 --> 00:01:43,951
Thank you so much.
You're amazing.

48
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:49,208
She has no idea
how amazing I am.

49
00:01:51,011 --> 00:01:53,479
Well, I hear we have
a dog bite over here.

50
00:01:53,547 --> 00:01:57,010
This is Jill and her
parents, Kyle and Nicole.

51
00:01:57,034 --> 00:01:58,433
Hi. I'm Dr. Avery.

52
00:01:59,753 --> 00:02:02,036
She says, "It's
nice to meet you."

53
00:02:02,105 --> 00:02:05,223
Now, your dog bit you, huh?
That doesn't seem very nice.

54
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:06,591
Jill is deaf, too.

55
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:07,859
Okay.

56
00:02:07,927 --> 00:02:10,045
Well, luckily,
it's not too deep.

57
00:02:10,114 --> 00:02:12,843
And since it's her face, I can
go ahead and stitch it right up.

58
00:02:12,867 --> 00:02:14,766
Nothing to worry about.

59
00:02:14,835 --> 00:02:16,084
He says, "Don't worry."

60
00:02:18,922 --> 00:02:22,323
That's good. Right here, okay?

61
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:25,877
We are not getting rid of the
dog. She was pulling his tail.

62
00:02:25,946 --> 00:02:29,230
He growled to let her
know he didn't like it.

63
00:02:29,299 --> 00:02:31,400
I know she can't hear.

64
00:02:31,468 --> 00:02:35,136
Excuse me. Kyle, have you and Nicole
considered a cochlear implant for Jill at all?

65
00:02:35,205 --> 00:02:37,839
Yeah, we've talked about
it. We're not interested.

66
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:39,185
She's the perfect candidate.

67
00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:41,053
She's the right
age, she's healthy,

68
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:44,717
and now is the time where
she would get the most benefit.

69
00:02:45,015 --> 00:02:46,698
Yes, I told him
"no." It's a "no."

70
00:02:46,767 --> 00:02:48,367
We feel very
strongly about that.

71
00:02:48,736 --> 00:02:49,751
Okay.

72
00:03:01,649 --> 00:03:03,598
See? Now you made her yell.

73
00:03:03,667 --> 00:03:05,917
He didn't say anything
about her being diseased.

74
00:03:05,986 --> 00:03:07,452
You're overreacting.

75
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:08,982
Oh, no, no. I
apologize. I'm sorry.

76
00:03:09,006 --> 00:03:11,684
We understand and
completely respect your decision.

77
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:14,793
Let's just get your little
girl all stitched up, okay?

78
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:20,798
This is a common
complication of gastric bypass.

79
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:23,713
The connections that your
previous surgeon created widened,

80
00:03:23,737 --> 00:03:27,000
so your stomach pouch and
intestines have stretched out.

81
00:03:27,024 --> 00:03:30,659
So, basically, it's as if I never
had the surgery done at all.

82
00:03:30,728 --> 00:03:32,728
Well, Dr. Grey and
I are confident that

83
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:34,596
we were able to
restore the anatomy

84
00:03:34,665 --> 00:03:36,397
of the gastric-bypass procedure

85
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:38,617
back to the way it was
prior to stretching out.

86
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:39,925
Is anyone here with you?

87
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:41,152
No.

88
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,954
I had my wife drop me off.

89
00:03:43,023 --> 00:03:46,925
She was there the first time, so I
told her she could sit this one out.

90
00:03:46,993 --> 00:03:49,778
I can handle a couple of
nights in the hospital on my own.

91
00:03:49,847 --> 00:03:51,462
Well, you won't be alone.

92
00:03:51,531 --> 00:03:54,149
There will be someone here to
monitor you throughout the night.

93
00:03:54,217 --> 00:03:56,818
Now, you just get
some rest, okay?

94
00:04:01,624 --> 00:04:03,858
Um...

95
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:07,095
Given his comorbidities,

96
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:09,898
he's a high risk for
post-op complications,

97
00:04:09,967 --> 00:04:13,585
which means one of us is gonna
have to stay here with him tonight.

98
00:04:14,555 --> 00:04:15,787
Um...

99
00:04:15,856 --> 00:04:18,223
This is where
you offer to do it.

100
00:04:18,292 --> 00:04:20,191
I kind of have plans.

101
00:04:20,243 --> 00:04:21,910
Ah, the all-nighter, Grey.

102
00:04:21,978 --> 00:04:24,345
It's the experience
that tests you the most,

103
00:04:24,414 --> 00:04:26,447
teaches you the most.

104
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:29,885
And when you look back on your
career, you remember it most fondly.

105
00:04:29,953 --> 00:04:32,849
I know that because I
did one last Monday night.

106
00:04:32,873 --> 00:04:35,273
That means you're
well-rested. Perfect.

107
00:04:35,342 --> 00:04:36,558
Good night.

108
00:04:38,896 --> 00:04:40,523
- Oh, thank you.
- Kathleen.

109
00:04:40,547 --> 00:04:43,947
Would you find Dr. Shepherd and ask
him to pick up the children at daycare?

110
00:04:46,487 --> 00:04:48,898
<i>I thought we'd take the
lead on gene receptors.</i>

111
00:04:48,922 --> 00:04:51,123
<i>We do gene receptors.</i>

112
00:04:51,191 --> 00:04:52,306
Sir?

113
00:04:52,376 --> 00:04:54,926
<i>Gene receptors are
our bread and butter.</i>

114
00:04:54,995 --> 00:04:57,523
<i>You tell Claesson that if he...</i>

115
00:04:57,547 --> 00:05:00,331
Even when I understand
him, I don't understand him.

116
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,251
You pushed Nova Jenkins'
hippocampectomy again?

117
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:06,315
Yeah, I had to. I got to take
these calls on Gdansk time.

118
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:08,974
You referred three cases to
the Cleveland Clinic last week.

119
00:05:09,043 --> 00:05:11,642
This is not okay, Derek.
People come here for you.

120
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:13,527
You still work here.

121
00:05:13,596 --> 00:05:15,141
You're the one who talked me
into this project in the first place.

122
00:05:15,165 --> 00:05:17,076
Webber tells me that
you canceled your lecture.

123
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,700
That's the fourth time you
canceled on the residents this month.

124
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:21,235
I know that
something has to give.

125
00:05:21,304 --> 00:05:23,772
But not surgery, and it
can't be teaching either.

126
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,385
I'll handle it. I've
got it handled.

127
00:05:25,409 --> 00:05:27,337
<i>Hello? Dr. Shepherd?</i>
Yeah. Hold on a second.

128
00:05:27,361 --> 00:05:29,494
The lectures will happen,

129
00:05:29,563 --> 00:05:32,947
and just put Nova Jenkins' surgery
back on the boards for tonight,

130
00:05:34,117 --> 00:05:35,245
and I'll handle it.

131
00:05:35,269 --> 00:05:36,484
Okay.

132
00:05:36,553 --> 00:05:37,947
<i>Dr. Shepherd?</i>

133
00:05:37,971 --> 00:05:39,748
Dr. Shepherd? DEREK: Yeah.

134
00:05:39,772 --> 00:05:41,901
Dr. Grey wanted me to remind you
to pick up the kids at daycare tonight.

135
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:43,403
Yes, got it. Got it handled.

136
00:05:43,427 --> 00:05:45,071
<i>Excuse me, Dr. Shepherd.
Are you there?</i>

137
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:46,128
Yeah, hi. Sorry.

138
00:05:46,196 --> 00:05:47,273
<i>Hello? Dr. Shepherd?</i>

139
00:05:49,049 --> 00:05:52,384
Braden's bone marrow
extraction went very well,

140
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:54,113
um, but he's gonna be
in some pain for a while.

141
00:05:54,137 --> 00:05:57,622
Hey, you did great,
Braden. We're almost there.

142
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:59,791
Mmm. Cool.

143
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:02,427
Can you explain it to
us one more time? Yeah.

144
00:06:02,496 --> 00:06:05,863
Because it still sounds like
you're gonna give our son HIV.

145
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:08,382
No. Um, it's gene therapy.

146
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:12,721
Braden lacks the ADA enzyme.
Without it, he has no immunity.

147
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:14,656
So in order to get it into him,

148
00:06:14,725 --> 00:06:18,059
I'm going to deliver it
on a fast-replicating virus.

149
00:06:18,128 --> 00:06:19,728
The HIV virus.

150
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:23,297
Yes, which will disseminate the
enzyme until it grows on its own.

151
00:06:23,366 --> 00:06:25,277
You want to inject him with HIV?

152
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:26,735
No, not per se.

153
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,436
Um, for the past two weeks,

154
00:06:28,505 --> 00:06:33,175
I've been working to
genetically disable an HIV virus.

155
00:06:33,243 --> 00:06:37,512
Okay, the HIV is
like a hat, okay?

156
00:06:37,581 --> 00:06:40,048
The virus is what matters.

157
00:06:40,116 --> 00:06:44,201
I've taken off the HIV hat, and I'm
gonna make it wear an enzyme hat.

158
00:06:46,589 --> 00:06:51,143
I know. It sounds
counterintuitive and scary.

159
00:06:51,195 --> 00:06:54,829
But I think this
is his best shot.

160
00:06:54,898 --> 00:06:56,042
We trust you.

161
00:06:56,066 --> 00:06:57,448
Okay.

162
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:01,085
Hey, we're gonna go, champ.

163
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:02,554
You gonna be okay?

164
00:07:02,623 --> 00:07:04,534
He's probably gonna
sleep for the rest of the night.

165
00:07:04,558 --> 00:07:07,225
Well, sweet dreams, Brady bug.

166
00:07:07,294 --> 00:07:09,694
Hey, dream about
replicating genes.

167
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:11,446
Or bunnies.

168
00:07:15,803 --> 00:07:16,868
Thank you.

169
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:18,603
Hey. Why aren't you dressed?

170
00:07:18,672 --> 00:07:20,772
Whoa. I, uh,
can't... I can't go.

171
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:22,919
I have to babysit
my bypass patient.

172
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:26,010
Oh, come on. Tomorrow,
everything changes.

173
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:27,557
I won't have
time to talk to you.

174
00:07:27,581 --> 00:07:29,181
I'll be too busy
being better than you.

175
00:07:29,248 --> 00:07:30,893
Good thing it's not
gonna go to your head.

176
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:32,017
Oh.

177
00:07:32,069 --> 00:07:33,501
The speech.

178
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:36,649
Uh, thank people and be
funny because people love funny.

179
00:07:36,673 --> 00:07:40,258
There's nothing funny
about babies with HLHS.

180
00:07:40,327 --> 00:07:41,567
You're no help to me.

181
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:48,516
Alex, tonight is
your lucky night

182
00:07:48,585 --> 00:07:51,352
because I will go
drinking with you.

183
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:53,872
Can't. Working.

184
00:07:56,626 --> 00:07:58,426
Kepner. Yeah?

185
00:07:59,796 --> 00:08:01,513
Never mind.

186
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:02,797
Okay.

187
00:08:08,805 --> 00:08:11,656
Hey, I just wanted to
check in before I go.

188
00:08:11,725 --> 00:08:13,118
Kids, Dr. Yang's
here. Say hello.

189
00:08:13,142 --> 00:08:14,442
Hi.

190
00:08:14,511 --> 00:08:16,528
I'm sorry.

191
00:08:16,597 --> 00:08:17,957
Jon bought them these tablets,
and it's destroying their brains.

192
00:08:17,981 --> 00:08:19,209
I'm always the bad guy.

193
00:08:19,233 --> 00:08:21,176
It was a joke, Jon. JON: Uh-huh.

194
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,467
Oh, I'm just gonna
be gone for 24 hours,

195
00:08:23,537 --> 00:08:25,236
so you can call
Dr. Hunt if you have

196
00:08:25,305 --> 00:08:26,971
any questions or problems, okay?

197
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,302
Enjoy it. Okay.

198
00:08:30,726 --> 00:08:33,389
What? What did I
say now? Nothing, Jon.

199
00:08:33,413 --> 00:08:34,858
Don't "nothing." What? Nothing.

200
00:08:34,882 --> 00:08:36,825
You get to go
every day. To work.

201
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:38,633
Still, you get a break.

202
00:08:38,702 --> 00:08:40,913
And then I'm here every
night, Sabine, after I work,

203
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:43,383
then check on the house,
run our errands, do the laundry.

204
00:08:43,407 --> 00:08:45,235
I come here to play with the
kids so you can get a break.

205
00:08:45,259 --> 00:08:46,591
You play with the kids? Really?

206
00:08:46,643 --> 00:08:48,709
You hand them tablets,
and then you watch sports.

207
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:50,356
We're basically
living in a hospital.

208
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:52,742
I can't exactly go out and toss
a ball around in the backyard.

209
00:08:52,766 --> 00:08:54,393
Mom, Dad. - You can go, Sabine.

210
00:08:54,417 --> 00:08:55,894
I have to go. Okay.

211
00:08:55,918 --> 00:08:57,563
You can go anytime I'm
here, but you don't dare

212
00:08:57,587 --> 00:08:58,882
because you're the only
decent parent. I never said that.

213
00:08:58,906 --> 00:09:00,450
You never say
anything! You jab at me!

214
00:09:00,474 --> 00:09:01,885
You guys, you're
giving me a headache.

215
00:09:01,909 --> 00:09:03,620
And then you back away
and act like nothing happened.

216
00:09:03,644 --> 00:09:05,488
Jon, cut it out! Okay, you
guys need to just bring it...

217
00:09:05,512 --> 00:09:07,490
No. Damn it, Jon. Just
go. If you want to, go!

218
00:09:07,514 --> 00:09:09,542
We can't go anywhere!
Okay, Sabine, sit down.

219
00:09:09,566 --> 00:09:11,277
Jon, you need to leave.
Where am I supposed to...

220
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:13,901
I don't care, but you
need to go right now.

221
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:32,147
<i>But that's not fair.</i>

222
00:09:32,171 --> 00:09:34,906
Karaoke's my thing. Now,
you can't go without me.

223
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:37,007
Wait. This is a karaoke bar?

224
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:39,422
It's a regular bar that
happens to have karaoke.

225
00:09:39,446 --> 00:09:40,678
How is that different?

226
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:42,313
It's totally different,

227
00:09:42,382 --> 00:09:44,727
and that's something I know
because karaoke's kind of my thing.

228
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:47,096
If it makes you feel any better,
I'm also gonna be missing out.

229
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,719
I'm just coming
off a 32-hour run.

230
00:09:48,789 --> 00:09:52,690
All I really want is a hot
bath and a soft pillow.

231
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:55,743
Aw! Gramps, how about
a glass of warm milk, too?

232
00:09:55,811 --> 00:09:58,196
See? You mock. But
actually, that sounds fantastic.

233
00:09:58,265 --> 00:10:01,065
Okay, everybody, get out of
your streets and into your scrubs.

234
00:10:01,134 --> 00:10:02,444
I'm gonna teach you
everything there is

235
00:10:02,468 --> 00:10:04,085
to know about a hippocampectomy.

236
00:10:04,153 --> 00:10:05,731
But you canceled that lecture.

237
00:10:05,755 --> 00:10:07,822
Yes, I did, and I
did you a disservice.

238
00:10:07,891 --> 00:10:09,824
Not only is it a rare procedure,

239
00:10:09,893 --> 00:10:12,844
it's one of the most delicate and
elegant a neurosurgeon can perform,

240
00:10:12,913 --> 00:10:15,746
which you will see later tonight
when you scrub in with me.

241
00:10:15,816 --> 00:10:17,031
Tonight?

242
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:18,795
Unless you have
something else better to do

243
00:10:18,819 --> 00:10:21,480
than to cure a young girl of her
debilitating seizures, Dr. Warren.

244
00:10:21,504 --> 00:10:22,603
No.

245
00:10:46,846 --> 00:10:47,879
Hmm.

246
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:57,221
Hey, Miranda.

247
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:59,035
Hey, come look at my virus.

248
00:10:59,059 --> 00:11:01,258
I can't. I thought I
was going home.

249
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,260
But Shepherd's got
us pulling an all-nighter.

250
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:04,707
Oh. Um...

251
00:11:04,731 --> 00:11:06,814
What are you doing?
Watching my virus chill.

252
00:11:06,883 --> 00:11:10,351
Hmm. That's, um... That's crazy.

253
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:14,222
I just removed stem cells
from Braden's bone marrow

254
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:16,924
and injected them
into this disabled virus.

255
00:11:16,993 --> 00:11:19,577
I just pulled a 32-hour shift.

256
00:11:19,646 --> 00:11:22,514
You see, I should be
sleeping, but I'm working.

257
00:11:22,582 --> 00:11:25,399
And you are here
and have no work.

258
00:11:25,468 --> 00:11:26,567
You should go home

259
00:11:27,754 --> 00:11:30,904
and sleep. For me. Hmm?

260
00:11:35,262 --> 00:11:37,896
I'm just gonna
watch. Go to sleep!

261
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:45,786
"Boundaries are only
there to be pushed.

262
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:48,606
"I am grateful for the
opportunity to have pushed.

263
00:11:48,675 --> 00:11:51,976
"I'm also grateful
for the recognition."

264
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:53,045
How's that?

265
00:11:53,095 --> 00:11:54,512
It's nice.

266
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,363
It's kind of braggy.

267
00:11:56,432 --> 00:11:59,533
Well, it's supposed to be braggy.
I'm winning an award. My turn?

268
00:11:59,602 --> 00:12:00,602
Mmm-hmm.

269
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:05,022
Wow.

270
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:06,635
Yes, I have very steady hands.

271
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:08,342
Braggy.

272
00:12:08,411 --> 00:12:11,262
What are you still doing
here? Oh, hey, um...

273
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:13,370
Well, a bunch of stuff happened.

274
00:12:13,616 --> 00:12:14,849
Ivy, your head okay?

275
00:12:14,917 --> 00:12:17,117
Yeah, it's just a
headache. It's getting better.

276
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:20,366
Jon and Sabine had
a complete meltdown.

277
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:22,385
I kicked him out, and she's
downstairs getting coffee.

278
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:24,809
I am trying to
distract the kids.

279
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:26,589
My drinking buddy is
stuck at the hospital,

280
00:12:26,613 --> 00:12:28,090
and I still have to
write my speech.

281
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:30,376
So will you help me?

282
00:12:33,403 --> 00:12:35,336
<i>Hey, Frankie. I can't sleep.</i>

283
00:12:35,405 --> 00:12:36,565
<i>Want to play hide-and-seek?</i>

284
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,349
Can I? 15 minutes.

285
00:12:40,476 --> 00:12:42,076
Wait, uh.

286
00:12:42,145 --> 00:12:44,278
You paged me to
listen to your speech?

287
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:46,030
Maybe.

288
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:47,364
Mmm-hmm.

289
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,953
Oh, come on. You
can't be that busy.

290
00:12:52,072 --> 00:12:54,072
There he is. You
ought to be ashamed.

291
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,790
Chelsea, don't yell at
him. He's doing his best.

292
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:58,739
No. Nova, you're sweet.

293
00:12:58,794 --> 00:13:01,657
But you're a pushover, and
you won't say this, so I will.

294
00:13:01,681 --> 00:13:04,115
She's sick, and you
keep jerking her around,

295
00:13:04,184 --> 00:13:07,529
scheduling her surgery, then
canceling it, scheduling and canceling.

296
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:11,372
She hasn't eaten in two days and has
had three seizures in the last six hours.

297
00:13:11,441 --> 00:13:13,024
You're absolutely right.

298
00:13:13,092 --> 00:13:14,592
I'm sorry it's
been so difficult,

299
00:13:14,661 --> 00:13:16,154
but we are going
to do the surgery.

300
00:13:16,178 --> 00:13:17,845
When? Tonight.

301
00:13:17,914 --> 00:13:21,365
The OR is available at 1:30,
so, technically, it's the morning.

302
00:13:21,434 --> 00:13:22,878
Really? Really.

303
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:23,918
Finally.

304
00:13:23,986 --> 00:13:25,152
Mmm-hmm.

305
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:27,088
Well, there you go.

306
00:13:27,156 --> 00:13:29,941
See what a little
backbone will get you?

307
00:13:34,047 --> 00:13:36,747
1:30 a.m. That's
still hours away.

308
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:39,467
Well, don't worry, Dr. Warren.
I just got a page from the ER.

309
00:13:39,535 --> 00:13:41,886
We'll have plenty to do
before then. Come along.

310
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:48,042
Aw, poor Gramps. I'm fine.

311
00:13:52,264 --> 00:13:53,698
What happened?

312
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:55,978
His blood pressure is dropping,
and his heart rate is in the 130s.

313
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:57,351
NG tube lavage is clear.

314
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,070
He's got a GI bleed, either from

315
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:00,705
the remnant or
the JJ staple line.

316
00:14:00,774 --> 00:14:02,606
Activate the massive
transfusion protocol.

317
00:14:02,676 --> 00:14:04,436
Call the OR and let
them know we're coming.

318
00:14:04,477 --> 00:14:07,378
Get me a second-year resident.
I'm gonna need extra hands in there.

319
00:14:07,446 --> 00:14:09,975
None of the second years are
available. They're all with Dr. Shepherd.

320
00:14:09,999 --> 00:14:11,444
Dr. Shepherd isn't
even in the hospital.

321
00:14:11,468 --> 00:14:13,767
He is. He has surgery scheduled.

322
00:14:13,836 --> 00:14:16,020
Then where the hell are my kids?

323
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:20,519
And it's not like I'm insensitive
to deaf culture or anything.

324
00:14:20,543 --> 00:14:22,110
I just don't...

325
00:14:22,178 --> 00:14:23,555
I don't get how, as parents,

326
00:14:23,579 --> 00:14:27,348
you don't want your kid to
experience hearing, if they could.

327
00:14:29,853 --> 00:14:32,620
What? You disagree?

328
00:14:32,689 --> 00:14:34,989
They're her parents,
Jackson, not us.

329
00:14:35,058 --> 00:14:39,810
Yeah, well, if that was our kid, she'd
be fitted for an implant three years ago.

330
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,430
Really?

331
00:14:42,498 --> 00:14:43,964
Yeah.

332
00:14:44,033 --> 00:14:45,049
Just like that?

333
00:14:45,118 --> 00:14:47,435
What if I felt
differently about it?

334
00:14:47,937 --> 00:14:49,020
Do you?

335
00:14:50,173 --> 00:14:51,472
Yeah.

336
00:14:54,611 --> 00:14:55,691
Oh, okay.

337
00:14:56,446 --> 00:14:58,179
Don't do that.

338
00:14:58,247 --> 00:15:00,948
Don't dismiss how I
feel. My opinion matters.

339
00:15:01,017 --> 00:15:02,517
I am one half of
this relationship.

340
00:15:02,585 --> 00:15:05,520
It's my kid, too, and it's not
getting a cochlear implant.

341
00:15:05,588 --> 00:15:06,982
All right. It's important that

342
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:10,324
we immerse them in the deaf
community, who consider deafness,

343
00:15:10,393 --> 00:15:12,860
by the way, to be a
blessing and not a disability,

344
00:15:12,928 --> 00:15:14,606
instead of just opting
for an elective surgery.

345
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:17,670
I'm sorry. A blessing?

346
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:20,934
What happened?

347
00:15:22,138 --> 00:15:23,537
Ivy spiked a fever,

348
00:15:23,606 --> 00:15:25,966
and she's experiencing
some shortness of breath.

349
00:15:29,796 --> 00:15:31,312
Mom, is everything okay?

350
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:33,414
Not now, honey.

351
00:15:33,482 --> 00:15:35,048
Can I keep playing?

352
00:15:35,117 --> 00:15:37,385
Uh, yeah. Sure,
sure. Just stay close.

353
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:47,911
I'm going to book an OR
and do a biopsy right away.

354
00:15:47,981 --> 00:15:50,192
You should call Jon
and get him back here.

355
00:15:50,216 --> 00:15:52,136
Why? What's going
on? What's wrong?

356
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:55,019
I think Ivy is
rejecting her heart.

357
00:16:07,517 --> 00:16:10,418
This remnant is
completely distended.

358
00:16:10,486 --> 00:16:12,436
Try his cell again.

359
00:16:12,505 --> 00:16:15,568
All right, I'm performing a gastrotomy
to remove this intraluminal blood.

360
00:16:15,592 --> 00:16:17,908
Keep transfusing until I
get the bleeding controlled.

361
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:20,177
Suction. Lap pad.

362
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,747
More suction.

363
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,459
<i>Hi, you've reached Dr. Shepherd.</i>

364
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:27,051
<i>Please leave a message,
and I will return your call.</i>

365
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,697
Derek, the daycare is closed,

366
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:30,132
the babysitters have
not heard from you,

367
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:31,800
and no one is answering at home.

368
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,724
Where are our children, Derek?

369
00:16:33,793 --> 00:16:36,905
Now, a ring fracture almost
always causes the dura to tear.

370
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:38,807
You need to take care
not to make it worse.

371
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:42,200
Murphy, get in here
and help her retract.

372
00:16:42,268 --> 00:16:44,613
You need to see where
you're going as you extract.

373
00:16:44,637 --> 00:16:47,321
Dr. Shepherd, this man
flatlined five minutes ago.

374
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:49,101
Yeah, that's true,
but this is a great

375
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:50,770
opportunity to learn
on an actual brain.

376
00:16:50,794 --> 00:16:52,293
It does seem a little strange.

377
00:16:52,361 --> 00:16:53,838
If by "strange," you
mean "awesome."

378
00:16:53,862 --> 00:16:55,340
Dr. Shepherd? DEREK: Yes.

379
00:16:55,364 --> 00:16:58,098
Dr. Grey's in OR 3 and needs
to speak to you right away.

380
00:16:58,167 --> 00:17:00,934
Right. Okay, where's my phone?
Where did I put my lab coat?

381
00:17:01,021 --> 00:17:02,520
Thirty seconds.

382
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:05,923
Just 30 seconds.

383
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,795
Oh, wow, you just spit
up all over my pretty dress,

384
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:12,529
didn't you, Bailey?

385
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:14,799
Okay, I canceled
the reservation.

386
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,979
Shepherd owes us big time.
He said he owes us, right?

387
00:17:17,003 --> 00:17:19,520
Yes. Something about
taking Sofia for the weekend

388
00:17:19,588 --> 00:17:20,699
so we could have a getaway,

389
00:17:20,723 --> 00:17:22,301
and I'm holding him to it.

390
00:17:22,325 --> 00:17:24,541
Um, Callie, can you hold
him? 'Cause it's dribbling.

391
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:26,071
Yeah. Oh, here.

392
00:17:26,095 --> 00:17:28,078
Hi! Look at that, Bailey.

393
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:31,315
Yes, hi. Hello. Yes, hi.

394
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:33,128
Look at that.

395
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:34,329
Oh, my gosh.

396
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:36,621
You forget what it's like
to have one this small.

397
00:17:36,689 --> 00:17:38,322
How did we do it before?

398
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,074
Oh, well, we had Mark.

399
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:41,642
God, I miss Mark.

400
00:17:41,711 --> 00:17:44,312
Yeah, I miss him, too.

401
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:45,957
And three's a lot.
Makes me think we

402
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:48,349
should stop after I
have this next one.

403
00:17:48,417 --> 00:17:51,035
What do you mean after
you have the next one?

404
00:17:51,954 --> 00:17:53,654
Oh, well, I meant "we."

405
00:17:53,723 --> 00:17:55,400
I was just saying "I" 'cause
I'm gonna, you know, have it.

406
00:17:55,424 --> 00:17:56,902
Oh, you're gonna
have the next one?

407
00:17:56,926 --> 00:17:59,086
I didn't know that
we decided that.

408
00:17:59,529 --> 00:18:01,609
I didn't know there
was anything to decide.

409
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,399
Amazing.

410
00:18:05,467 --> 00:18:06,517
Fantastic.

411
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:08,464
Disgusting! Edwards.

412
00:18:08,488 --> 00:18:09,765
I'm sorry, Dr. Shepherd.

413
00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:10,983
Yeah, don't apologize to me.

414
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:13,073
Apologize to Mr. Quaid.

415
00:18:13,142 --> 00:18:14,491
I'm sorry, Mr. Quaid.

416
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,294
It's cool.

417
00:18:16,362 --> 00:18:18,495
It's gross. Super gross.

418
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:20,164
Hey, Doc. Hmm?

419
00:18:20,216 --> 00:18:21,594
Figure out how you're gonna get

420
00:18:21,618 --> 00:18:23,045
these bastards out of my noggin?

421
00:18:23,069 --> 00:18:28,923
Yes. It will be a very
careful, very precise yank.

422
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:30,724
Oh, me! Me, me, me!

423
00:18:37,467 --> 00:18:38,844
Do I have to do that thing where

424
00:18:38,868 --> 00:18:40,162
I acknowledge the losers?

425
00:18:40,186 --> 00:18:41,813
'Cause I have like five minutes.

426
00:18:41,837 --> 00:18:43,882
I don't want to waste it on
people I don't even know.

427
00:18:43,906 --> 00:18:45,866
Mmm. It is a courtesy.

428
00:18:47,994 --> 00:18:50,394
You're nervous.

429
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:52,208
You know, I know you
think that I'm too busy,

430
00:18:52,232 --> 00:18:55,512
but I can make it work, if
you don't want to be alone.

431
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:58,850
But I do.

432
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:02,292
Wait, you think
you're gonna lose?

433
00:19:04,611 --> 00:19:06,810
Let me go alone.

434
00:19:12,385 --> 00:19:13,534
I'll update the family.

435
00:19:18,424 --> 00:19:19,540
Uh...

436
00:19:21,411 --> 00:19:23,627
Come on. Don't be such a weenie.

437
00:19:23,696 --> 00:19:24,761
I'm not being a weenie.

438
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,074
You're kind of being a weenie.

439
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:27,576
Murphy, the shears
have only hit areas

440
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,961
of non-eloquent brain function.

441
00:19:28,985 --> 00:19:31,885
The risk of further
damage is minimal.

442
00:19:31,954 --> 00:19:34,274
So go ahead. Pull it out.

443
00:19:35,792 --> 00:19:37,391
Wait.

444
00:19:38,912 --> 00:19:41,962
Okay, vessels intact. Go ahead.

445
00:19:43,949 --> 00:19:46,100
Oh, for God's sake,
she's not going anywhere.

446
00:19:46,168 --> 00:19:49,720
Dr. Shepherd, permission
to step in. Mmm-hmm.

447
00:19:49,788 --> 00:19:50,938
Thank you.

448
00:19:54,376 --> 00:19:56,226
Okay.

449
00:20:01,684 --> 00:20:03,262
Well, that was a little much.

450
00:20:03,286 --> 00:20:04,913
Way to go, Lady Hulk.

451
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:08,417
Get ready for a big bleeder
and a crash-dive craniotomy.

452
00:20:09,158 --> 00:20:11,091
In your face!

453
00:20:11,927 --> 00:20:13,394
Not you, Dr. Shepherd.

454
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:15,061
Um, irrigation.

455
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,878
Nova Jenkins is prepped
and ready for surgery.

456
00:20:19,902 --> 00:20:22,380
Okay, great. I've got a little bit
more to do with Mr. Quaid here.

457
00:20:22,404 --> 00:20:24,082
But, guys, go eat and hydrate.

458
00:20:24,106 --> 00:20:27,146
I'll see you in the OR in
about eight minutes. Hustle.

459
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:28,726
Derek.

460
00:20:29,545 --> 00:20:31,028
Oh, I'm sorry.

461
00:20:31,097 --> 00:20:33,013
Where the hell are my kids?

462
00:20:34,884 --> 00:20:36,416
Don't do that!

463
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:38,296
Don't walk away from me when
I'm in the middle of a sentence.

464
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,165
Can we just go to bed, please?

465
00:20:40,189 --> 00:20:41,689
I can't sleep now,

466
00:20:41,758 --> 00:20:44,625
not when you're willfully
ignoring my wishes, my beliefs...

467
00:20:44,694 --> 00:20:47,472
About what? Our fictitious
child? It's irrelevant.

468
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:49,207
You know how slim the
chances are of our kid being deaf?

469
00:20:49,231 --> 00:20:50,430
That is not the point!

470
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:51,579
What is the point?

471
00:20:51,617 --> 00:20:53,650
You think they're stupid.

472
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:55,399
You think that they
are being bad parents

473
00:20:55,455 --> 00:20:57,666
because they want to raise
their kid differently than you would.

474
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:00,636
Come on. I never said
that. You are judging them!

475
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:01,903
You think they're ridiculous.

476
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:03,138
Why are we arguing about this?

477
00:21:03,162 --> 00:21:06,047
Because it means you
think I'm ridiculous, too!

478
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,540
Wait a second. What?

479
00:21:11,654 --> 00:21:15,322
Replace "cochlear implant"
with the word "christening,"

480
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:18,275
"Bible study,"

481
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,594
"prayer."

482
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:25,866
Now tell me this has
nothing to do with us.

483
00:21:28,071 --> 00:21:31,088
Come on. Pick
up, pick up, pick up.

484
00:21:31,157 --> 00:21:33,424
Jon, where are you?

485
00:21:33,493 --> 00:21:37,005
They just took Ivy up to the OR.
They think that she's rejecting her heart.

486
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:39,129
I can't find Frankie.
She disappeared.

487
00:21:39,198 --> 00:21:40,631
You just have to get back here.

488
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:42,332
Call me as soon as you get this.

489
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:43,929
What do you mean
you can't find Frankie?

490
00:21:43,953 --> 00:21:45,753
Don't you know where she is?

491
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:48,439
Whoa.

492
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:50,624
What?

493
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:56,146
Watch out.

494
00:22:00,386 --> 00:22:02,906
Well, she usually hides
somewhere over here.

495
00:22:10,446 --> 00:22:12,295
Gotcha.

496
00:22:12,365 --> 00:22:14,748
Bam! Gotcha, Frankie!

497
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:18,819
Wake up.

498
00:22:18,904 --> 00:22:20,899
Wake up. Frankie, wake up!

499
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:22,843
Wait, hold on, Braden. Back up.

500
00:22:23,659 --> 00:22:25,779
Left, left, left. Hold it.

501
00:22:26,295 --> 00:22:28,612
Back up. Back up.

502
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:30,581
Right. Right, right.

503
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:33,600
Hold it. Back up. Back up.

504
00:22:33,669 --> 00:22:35,353
Oh! Oh, crap.

505
00:22:35,421 --> 00:22:36,821
Frankie!

506
00:22:42,845 --> 00:22:44,289
Do you know where she is?

507
00:22:44,313 --> 00:22:45,690
No, crappy camera couldn't
zoom in on a room number.

508
00:22:45,714 --> 00:22:46,858
She's in a linen storage.

509
00:22:46,882 --> 00:22:48,359
Well, which one? I don't know.

510
00:22:48,383 --> 00:22:49,616
That one.

511
00:22:53,272 --> 00:22:54,454
Pulse is faint.

512
00:22:54,523 --> 00:22:56,883
Let's get her on a
bed and on a monitor.

513
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:01,846
Ivy's biopsy sample's
on its way to path.

514
00:23:01,914 --> 00:23:04,281
Frankie's in heart failure.
Karev and I ran an EKG.

515
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:07,017
It's not her pacemaker.
She needs an LVAD.

516
00:23:07,086 --> 00:23:10,204
Crap. These kids are like surgical
dominos. Okay, let's get her ready.

517
00:23:10,272 --> 00:23:12,184
Karev's prepping her in OR
4. What time's your flight?

518
00:23:12,208 --> 00:23:13,773
It doesn't matter.

519
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,926
Three hours?

520
00:23:15,995 --> 00:23:19,396
For three hours, Derek, I had
no idea where our children were.

521
00:23:19,465 --> 00:23:21,443
I had my hand inside
a guy's stomach,

522
00:23:21,467 --> 00:23:24,251
and all I could think was...
I told you I had it handled.

523
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,053
You told me you had them.

524
00:23:26,122 --> 00:23:28,299
I thought I did. I had a
surgery. I had to teach.

525
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:30,307
Hunt and Webber accused
me of dropping the ball.

526
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:32,275
You dropped this ball.

527
00:23:32,344 --> 00:23:34,823
If you put our kids somewhere,
Derek, you have to tell me.

528
00:23:34,847 --> 00:23:36,914
Let's just step
back for a second

529
00:23:36,983 --> 00:23:39,066
and take a look that
the kids are fine, okay?

530
00:23:39,135 --> 00:23:41,184
I just forgot to make
a phone call, okay?

531
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:43,219
Now I've got a
surgery to get to.

532
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:54,315
Mmm-hmm. No, they're
fine. Zola's asleep.

533
00:23:54,383 --> 00:23:56,023
And Bailey was out like a light.

534
00:23:57,419 --> 00:24:00,232
No, I don't. I don't know
why Derek didn't tell you.

535
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:01,388
Yeah.

536
00:24:01,457 --> 00:24:03,324
No, not a problem. Anytime.

537
00:24:03,392 --> 00:24:05,125
Okay. Bye.

538
00:24:12,434 --> 00:24:13,467
Mmm.

539
00:24:17,006 --> 00:24:18,805
I never would have just assumed

540
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:20,741
you didn't want
to carry our child.

541
00:24:20,809 --> 00:24:22,142
Mmm-hmm.

542
00:24:22,211 --> 00:24:25,379
You said, "I can't take
another loss. It's too hard."

543
00:24:25,447 --> 00:24:27,147
I took that as a "no."

544
00:24:27,216 --> 00:24:30,351
And I was afraid that if I asked
you again, it would make you too sad.

545
00:24:30,419 --> 00:24:31,919
Okay, that was a year ago,

546
00:24:31,988 --> 00:24:34,654
and there was a lot going on,
and maybe I changed my mind.

547
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:36,840
Have you? I don't know. Maybe.

548
00:24:38,878 --> 00:24:41,290
Arizona, if it would make you
happy, it would make me happy.

549
00:24:41,314 --> 00:24:44,434
Yeah, Yeah. But do
you think I should?

550
00:24:48,137 --> 00:24:50,916
Now, with this approach, we go straight
down the barrel to the hippocampus.

551
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:52,439
Questions?

552
00:24:54,309 --> 00:24:56,171
Stop. Okay, hold it.
Here. Let's just slow down.

553
00:24:56,195 --> 00:24:58,073
Here's what we're gonna do.
I'm gonna have each one of you

554
00:24:58,097 --> 00:25:00,063
take a turn next to
me at the microscope.

555
00:25:00,132 --> 00:25:02,866
Whoever is at the microscope
will ask one question.

556
00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:04,285
Ross, you go first.

557
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:08,913
Where's Gramps?

558
00:25:08,941 --> 00:25:11,252
Who cares? More
microscope time for us.

559
00:25:11,276 --> 00:25:12,592
Good point.

560
00:25:20,937 --> 00:25:22,915
Okay, I think you're
blowing this out of proportion.

561
00:25:22,939 --> 00:25:25,472
Am I? Because this is who I am.

562
00:25:25,541 --> 00:25:28,275
At my core, this defines me.

563
00:25:28,344 --> 00:25:30,689
And I know that.
I love you still.

564
00:25:30,713 --> 00:25:34,481
Oh, well, thank you. Thank you
so much for loving me anyway,

565
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:37,050
despite my beliefs,
despite my faith,

566
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:40,104
which I happen to hold
above everything else.

567
00:25:40,172 --> 00:25:43,356
You're twisting my words. It's
not... And you're ignoring mine!

568
00:25:43,425 --> 00:25:47,861
You don't accept who
I am or what I believe.

569
00:25:47,929 --> 00:25:50,481
You tolerate it. You judge it.

570
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:52,683
You judge my faith
because you don't have any.

571
00:25:52,752 --> 00:25:54,229
I have faith. I have
faith in medicine.

572
00:25:54,253 --> 00:25:55,780
I have faith in helping people.

573
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:59,005
That's not faith! Faith is
believing in what you can't see.

574
00:25:59,074 --> 00:26:00,740
Will you just admit it, Jackson?

575
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:02,409
You think what I
believe is ridiculous.

576
00:26:02,461 --> 00:26:04,361
Yes, because it is! Yes!

577
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:06,525
Your God is like our
hypothetical deaf child, April.

578
00:26:06,549 --> 00:26:07,749
It's not real.

579
00:26:16,175 --> 00:26:19,042
Look, all right, I'm sorry.

580
00:26:19,111 --> 00:26:22,551
It doesn't mean I don't
respect you. It's just...

581
00:26:26,419 --> 00:26:28,184
God, I just feel...

582
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:31,237
I just feel sorry for you.

583
00:26:31,306 --> 00:26:33,890
You don't know how
to believe in something

584
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:37,026
you can't touch
or feel, and that...

585
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:40,530
is so sad.

586
00:26:45,471 --> 00:26:47,654
So you pity me.

587
00:26:48,724 --> 00:26:50,424
I do.

588
00:26:51,994 --> 00:26:54,027
I really do.

589
00:27:02,321 --> 00:27:03,987
We should go to sleep.

590
00:27:11,497 --> 00:27:13,624
Looks like Frankie's
LVAD has good flow.

591
00:27:13,648 --> 00:27:14,843
I agree. Passing the cannulas.

592
00:27:14,867 --> 00:27:16,133
Got it.

593
00:27:16,202 --> 00:27:18,079
Thioproline. Start
protamine, please.

594
00:27:18,103 --> 00:27:19,302
Alex, you're still here?

595
00:27:19,371 --> 00:27:20,682
Night shift. You're still here?

596
00:27:20,706 --> 00:27:22,751
Yes, we're all still
here, obviously.

597
00:27:22,775 --> 00:27:24,051
Did you finish your speech?

598
00:27:24,075 --> 00:27:26,304
Nah, I'm just gonna wing it.

599
00:27:26,328 --> 00:27:28,161
It's weird. They've
made their decision.

600
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:30,664
Your name is typed on a
piece of paper in an envelope.

601
00:27:30,733 --> 00:27:32,327
I know. I always
figured I'd read

602
00:27:32,351 --> 00:27:34,062
about you winning
the Harper Avery.

603
00:27:34,086 --> 00:27:37,354
I didn't think I'd be operating with
you the night before you won it.

604
00:27:37,422 --> 00:27:40,640
When is the last time we all
pulled an all-nighter together?

605
00:27:40,709 --> 00:27:42,375
Third year?

606
00:27:42,444 --> 00:27:44,706
Oh, God. Look at us
now. You've got two kids.

607
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:47,780
I mean, you're about to win
a Harper Avery. And Alex...

608
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:49,760
Oh.

609
00:27:49,784 --> 00:27:50,984
Sad.

610
00:27:51,053 --> 00:27:52,533
Shut up. I got my own stuff.

611
00:27:52,587 --> 00:27:53,770
What stuff?

612
00:27:53,822 --> 00:27:55,889
Oh, lying. Sadder.

613
00:27:55,957 --> 00:27:58,352
A private practice is interested in
me, and I think I'm gonna take it.

614
00:27:58,376 --> 00:28:00,727
A private practice? Is
this the butthole guy?

615
00:28:00,795 --> 00:28:02,873
I've been moonlighting
over there, taking some shifts,

616
00:28:02,897 --> 00:28:04,542
just to see if I get
along with his partner.

617
00:28:04,566 --> 00:28:06,944
Don't tell Robbins.
And I'm killing it. Oh.

618
00:28:06,968 --> 00:28:08,408
And I'm killing
it here at night.

619
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:11,065
I'm killing it 24 hours a
day, and I can't tell anyone.

620
00:28:11,089 --> 00:28:13,785
Private practice? Why in the
world would you want that?

621
00:28:13,809 --> 00:28:16,187
Because my fellowship is ending,
and it's a crapload of money.

622
00:28:16,211 --> 00:28:17,822
And I didn't come from
a rich family like you,

623
00:28:17,846 --> 00:28:20,275
and I'm probably not gonna
win a Harper Avery anytime soon.

624
00:28:20,299 --> 00:28:22,139
Hmm, that's true. Screw you.

625
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:24,501
She might.

626
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:26,102
Might? Screw you.

627
00:28:27,389 --> 00:28:28,972
You don't think this is silly?

628
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:30,574
No!

629
00:28:30,642 --> 00:28:32,554
Okay, 'cause we're not
picking a movie or takeout.

630
00:28:32,578 --> 00:28:33,944
This is... It's a bigger deal.

631
00:28:34,013 --> 00:28:35,645
Yeah, this feels right.

632
00:28:35,715 --> 00:28:36,747
Okay.

633
00:28:36,816 --> 00:28:39,717
I mean, flipping a
coin feels right. Okay.

634
00:28:39,785 --> 00:28:43,025
It feels decisive. It's done.
Okay, great. Fine. Fine, fine, fine.

635
00:28:43,071 --> 00:28:45,439
Okay, heads,

636
00:28:45,508 --> 00:28:47,874
I will get pregnant
and carry our child,

637
00:28:47,943 --> 00:28:49,459
and tails,

638
00:28:49,528 --> 00:28:51,928
I get pregnant
and carry our child.

639
00:28:51,997 --> 00:28:53,630
Okay?

640
00:28:53,699 --> 00:28:55,766
And however it lands...

641
00:28:55,834 --> 00:28:58,513
That's what we
do. Right? All right.

642
00:28:58,537 --> 00:29:00,503
Okay. Right.

643
00:29:02,024 --> 00:29:03,534
No! You know what? You do it!

644
00:29:03,558 --> 00:29:06,643
I'm sorry.

645
00:29:06,711 --> 00:29:09,173
I don't want to.
I don't want to.

646
00:29:09,197 --> 00:29:11,637
And you did it last time,
and it was so beautiful.

647
00:29:11,667 --> 00:29:15,802
Just I don't want to. I
want you to. I want you to.

648
00:29:15,871 --> 00:29:17,165
Is that bad? Am I terrible?

649
00:29:17,189 --> 00:29:18,655
No, you're not terrible.

650
00:29:18,724 --> 00:29:21,103
Will you do it? Please?
Okay, wait, now hold on.

651
00:29:21,127 --> 00:29:22,220
Do you want to?

652
00:29:22,244 --> 00:29:24,764
I would love to. Oh!

653
00:29:26,581 --> 00:29:28,381
Oh.

654
00:29:29,351 --> 00:29:30,417
I'll flip you for it.

655
00:29:37,826 --> 00:29:40,427
All three of them are
on the transplant list?

656
00:29:40,496 --> 00:29:42,396
I'm afraid so.

657
00:29:42,464 --> 00:29:46,966
Ivy's biopsy results confirm that
she is, in fact, rejecting her heart.

658
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:51,738
But we are treating her
with anti-rejection medication.

659
00:29:51,806 --> 00:29:53,918
Frankie went into heart failure.

660
00:29:53,942 --> 00:29:56,409
I put in an LVAD to
help her heart function.

661
00:29:56,478 --> 00:29:58,823
We've called UNOS
and put both Ivy

662
00:29:58,847 --> 00:30:01,092
and Frankie on
the transplant list.

663
00:30:01,116 --> 00:30:03,967
With Link. God.

664
00:30:04,036 --> 00:30:06,331
We started the day with
one on the list, but three?

665
00:30:06,355 --> 00:30:08,705
Do you want us
to call Jon for you?

666
00:30:08,757 --> 00:30:10,741
He hasn't picked up
the phone once tonight,

667
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:15,111
and I've already filled his
mailbox with voicemails.

668
00:30:15,181 --> 00:30:18,715
They say this breaks
couples apart, sick kids.

669
00:30:18,784 --> 00:30:22,419
And we talked about that, but
we didn't think it'd happen to us.

670
00:30:22,488 --> 00:30:26,990
But then we didn't think
any of this would happen,

671
00:30:27,059 --> 00:30:28,692
happen to us.

672
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:33,513
Is this what it looks like?

673
00:30:36,284 --> 00:30:37,764
Is he gone?

674
00:30:46,278 --> 00:30:48,695
This is when
visibility gets difficult.

675
00:30:48,764 --> 00:30:50,575
So why don't we use a
self-retaining retractor?

676
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:52,026
You can't with a
keyhole incision.

677
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:54,318
You risk damaging the
anterior choroidal arteries,

678
00:30:54,386 --> 00:30:55,735
which could result in what?

679
00:30:55,804 --> 00:30:59,623
Infarction of the internal capsule
and adjacent basal ganglia.

680
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:03,109
Edwards, step
back. Wilson, step up.

681
00:31:03,178 --> 00:31:05,795
Man.

682
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:08,865
How can we tell if the patient
has suffered a PCA infarct?

683
00:31:08,934 --> 00:31:11,112
We wouldn't know until
after she'd woken up.

684
00:31:11,136 --> 00:31:12,647
Okay, good. And
what symptoms would

685
00:31:12,671 --> 00:31:14,604
we look for with a
lesion in this area?

686
00:31:14,672 --> 00:31:17,407
Contralateral hemiplegia,

687
00:31:17,475 --> 00:31:20,927
superior quadrantanopia,
and amnesia.

688
00:31:20,996 --> 00:31:22,796
Okay, Wilson, you're
out. Murphy, you're up.

689
00:31:22,831 --> 00:31:25,615
I was right. Well,
yes. You were.

690
00:31:25,684 --> 00:31:26,964
But nobody likes a know-it-all.

691
00:31:36,528 --> 00:31:38,094
We have a bleeder.

692
00:31:38,163 --> 00:31:39,930
I need visibility
in there, Murphy.

693
00:31:41,817 --> 00:31:43,066
Oh, no, no, no! Not the clamp!

694
00:31:44,953 --> 00:31:46,836
Murphy, what did I say?

695
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:48,972
I'm sorry. It's just...

696
00:31:49,041 --> 00:31:50,484
It was just instinct. My
hand just went there.

697
00:31:50,508 --> 00:31:51,874
Take a step back.

698
00:31:53,445 --> 00:31:54,622
I'm sorry. Is she gonna be okay?

699
00:31:54,646 --> 00:31:55,745
Just quiet, please.

700
00:31:58,283 --> 00:32:00,700
Dr. Shepherd... I said be quiet!

701
00:32:02,771 --> 00:32:03,981
Do they know where we are?

702
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:05,505
I was very specific.

703
00:32:05,574 --> 00:32:08,107
Well, I hope this cab doesn't
make you miss your flight.

704
00:32:09,511 --> 00:32:11,211
Oh, God.

705
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:13,046
My bypass patient's
in V-fib. I got to...

706
00:32:13,114 --> 00:32:14,781
Go, go, go. Save a life.

707
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:18,084
Okay. Good luck. Okay, thanks.

708
00:32:18,153 --> 00:32:20,598
You know, maybe we should just
call the cab company and make sure...

709
00:32:20,622 --> 00:32:22,233
You know, Owen, it'll be fine.

710
00:32:22,257 --> 00:32:25,158
There's no traffic this
early. I'm not checking a bag.

711
00:32:25,227 --> 00:32:26,759
I've got time.

712
00:32:26,828 --> 00:32:28,039
Oh.

713
00:32:28,063 --> 00:32:29,196
You got to go, too.

714
00:32:29,264 --> 00:32:30,775
No, no. I can wait a second.

715
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:32,699
MVC pileup on the freeway.

716
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:34,401
You don't want to ignore that.

717
00:32:34,469 --> 00:32:36,802
I want to see you off.

718
00:32:36,871 --> 00:32:39,672
I'll be gone all of 24 hours.

719
00:32:39,741 --> 00:32:42,242
This isn't some
glamorous goodbye.

720
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:44,350
I'm catching a cab. I know
how to send myself off.

721
00:32:44,996 --> 00:32:46,196
You sure?

722
00:32:46,265 --> 00:32:47,397
Owen.

723
00:32:50,919 --> 00:32:53,420
Go, go.

724
00:32:53,489 --> 00:32:55,972
Okay, all right.

725
00:32:56,041 --> 00:32:58,074
Knock them dead. Okay.

726
00:33:31,643 --> 00:33:34,177
Nurse's station. Yeah.

727
00:33:36,248 --> 00:33:37,881
Dr. Warren,

728
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:40,133
we have an on-call
room for this.

729
00:33:40,202 --> 00:33:41,851
Hmm?

730
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:45,338
I heard Dr. Shepherd had you on
an all-night surgery. How did it go?

731
00:33:45,407 --> 00:33:46,506
Crap!

732
00:33:48,777 --> 00:33:49,876
Kids.

733
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:55,414
Nova, can you hear me?

734
00:33:55,483 --> 00:33:57,951
Why isn't she answering?

735
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:00,554
Nova?

736
00:34:01,206 --> 00:34:02,322
Nova?

737
00:34:04,059 --> 00:34:05,158
Nova?

738
00:34:05,244 --> 00:34:08,879
Now, if you can
understand me, blink.

739
00:34:10,883 --> 00:34:12,515
Nova.

740
00:34:13,552 --> 00:34:14,817
Is...

741
00:34:15,387 --> 00:34:17,454
it...

742
00:34:17,523 --> 00:34:22,358
okay if I just say "yes"?

743
00:34:22,427 --> 00:34:25,128
Or is the blinking
medically necessary?

744
00:34:25,197 --> 00:34:27,480
That works for me.

745
00:34:27,549 --> 00:34:30,917
I can absolutely blink, too.

746
00:34:30,986 --> 00:34:33,736
It's really no trouble.

747
00:34:33,805 --> 00:34:36,022
So, everything's good here.

748
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:39,259
Now, Dr. Murphy will be in
charge of your post-op care,

749
00:34:39,328 --> 00:34:42,812
and she will be in every hour
to give you a neuro check.

750
00:34:42,881 --> 00:34:44,542
All you have to do
right now is just rest.

751
00:34:44,566 --> 00:34:46,406
Sounds good to me. Okay, good.

752
00:34:57,529 --> 00:34:59,579
Murphy, doctors
don't cry in hallways.

753
00:34:59,647 --> 00:35:02,014
We have stairwells for that.

754
00:35:02,083 --> 00:35:04,701
I'm sorry. I'm just so relieved.

755
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:06,369
Yeah, you got lucky today.

756
00:35:06,438 --> 00:35:08,271
Nothing bad happened,
but it could have.

757
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:11,357
And if it had, it would
have been on you.

758
00:35:12,794 --> 00:35:15,896
So remember that
feeling, that "what if?"

759
00:35:15,981 --> 00:35:17,880
Not the relief.

760
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:20,733
It'll keep you from
making that mistake again.

761
00:35:20,802 --> 00:35:22,468
Yes, sir.

762
00:35:24,005 --> 00:35:25,422
What did I miss?

763
00:35:30,145 --> 00:35:31,611
Sabine?

764
00:35:33,715 --> 00:35:34,764
Honey.

765
00:35:36,251 --> 00:35:37,450
I'm sorry.

766
00:35:38,036 --> 00:35:40,203
I'm so sorry.

767
00:35:40,272 --> 00:35:42,255
I fell asleep. I
was right outside.

768
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:46,209
I went to sit in the
car and cool off,

769
00:35:46,278 --> 00:35:49,912
and I fell asleep, and my phone
died, and I never should have left.

770
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:52,748
I should have
been here with you.

771
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:54,137
You shouldn't have been alone.

772
00:35:54,602 --> 00:35:56,736
I'm sorry.

773
00:35:56,805 --> 00:35:59,739
I love you. I love you so much.

774
00:35:59,808 --> 00:36:01,540
I'm so sorry.

775
00:36:04,363 --> 00:36:05,840
I don't know how you do it.

776
00:36:05,864 --> 00:36:08,898
I don't know how you
can be a double agent.

777
00:36:08,967 --> 00:36:12,869
I come off of even
one all-nighter,

778
00:36:12,937 --> 00:36:16,156
and I feel hollow, jangly.

779
00:36:16,224 --> 00:36:18,258
Do you ever get that?

780
00:36:18,326 --> 00:36:20,877
The hollow janglies?

781
00:36:24,165 --> 00:36:25,531
Alex.

782
00:36:28,202 --> 00:36:30,282
I'm good.

783
00:36:31,523 --> 00:36:33,222
No, we're good on
magnetic resonance.

784
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:35,152
We don't need any more of the
groups on magnetic resonance.

785
00:36:35,176 --> 00:36:36,375
UCLA's got that.

786
00:36:36,445 --> 00:36:38,761
Hey, let me call you back.

787
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:41,064
I'm sorry.

788
00:36:41,132 --> 00:36:43,432
I should have called you.

789
00:36:44,469 --> 00:36:45,969
I dropped the ball.

790
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:48,505
This ball can't get dropped.

791
00:36:48,573 --> 00:36:52,342
I know. Nothing catastrophic
has happened yet, but it could.

792
00:36:52,411 --> 00:36:54,377
We're juggling too much.

793
00:36:54,446 --> 00:36:56,095
Something has to change.

794
00:36:56,164 --> 00:36:57,758
Are you saying it has to be
me? I'm not saying that, Meredith.

795
00:36:57,782 --> 00:36:59,849
I'm just saying that
something's got to change.

796
00:36:59,918 --> 00:37:04,320
I know. I know. I just...
I don't know what to do.

797
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:06,455
Oh, neither do I.

798
00:37:08,509 --> 00:37:11,510
But I do know that

799
00:37:11,579 --> 00:37:13,658
I need you to
take the kids today.

800
00:37:13,682 --> 00:37:15,225
Can you do that for
me? Of course, yes,

801
00:37:15,249 --> 00:37:17,616
and I will update you
on our position hourly.

802
00:37:17,685 --> 00:37:19,113
You don't have
to do that. I just...

803
00:37:19,137 --> 00:37:20,486
No, but I will.

804
00:37:20,555 --> 00:37:22,572
Okay. All right.

805
00:37:26,811 --> 00:37:28,691
Who's here?

806
00:37:29,113 --> 00:37:30,346
April?

807
00:37:31,349 --> 00:37:33,450
Can I stay here
for a little while?

808
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:47,997
You were right!

809
00:37:48,066 --> 00:37:51,967
I got a good night's
sleep. I slept like a log.

810
00:37:52,036 --> 00:37:53,169
Got up this morning.

811
00:37:53,238 --> 00:37:55,404
I made some homemade
French toast with bacon.

812
00:37:55,473 --> 00:37:57,841
Candied bacon, if
you want to know.

813
00:37:57,909 --> 00:37:59,287
I even had time
to read the paper.

814
00:37:59,311 --> 00:38:00,977
Now I'm gonna go
check on my virus,

815
00:38:01,045 --> 00:38:03,179
which also got a good
night's sleep, thanks to you.

816
00:38:03,248 --> 00:38:04,808
And now you can go
and get some sleep.

817
00:38:04,849 --> 00:38:06,394
I left your favorite
tea on the counter.

818
00:38:06,418 --> 00:38:08,730
Well, actually, I managed
to squeeze in a power nap.

819
00:38:08,754 --> 00:38:10,931
So I'm feeling all right. Hmm.

820
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:14,552
I'm gonna scrub in on a shoulder
replacement with Torres in a few.

821
00:38:14,576 --> 00:38:18,111
Well, aren't you Superman?

822
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:33,543
Thank you so much.

823
00:38:41,619 --> 00:38:43,269
Excuse me. Dr. Yang?

824
00:38:43,337 --> 00:38:45,288
Dr. Robert Bonocore.
Cleveland Clinic?

825
00:38:45,356 --> 00:38:48,792
Oh, yes, the epilepsy
neurostimulator. It's so nice to meet...

826
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:51,310
I am a big fan. Huge, really.

827
00:38:51,379 --> 00:38:53,279
I have read all of your
work on the conduits.

828
00:38:53,348 --> 00:38:54,892
It's just fascinating. Truly.
Thank you. Thank you.

829
00:38:54,916 --> 00:38:57,728
You're Cristina Yang. Yes.

830
00:38:57,752 --> 00:38:59,197
Where are you with phase two?

831
00:38:59,221 --> 00:39:00,653
We're all waiting to see

832
00:39:00,722 --> 00:39:02,266
if we can get our
hands on it. Oh.

833
00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:04,068
Okay, I understand you're
still a cardiothoracic fellow.

834
00:39:04,092 --> 00:39:05,486
Yes. When do you finish up?

835
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:07,154
I imagine everyone's
asking you that.

836
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:09,695
You must be thrilled to be
nominated so early in your career.

837
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:11,764
Any relation to Dr. Tara Yang?

838
00:39:11,833 --> 00:39:14,133
She was my roommate at
UPenn. She was so funny.

839
00:39:14,201 --> 00:39:15,441
Oh, I'm unfortunately...

840
00:39:16,738 --> 00:39:18,215
Oh, looks like it's time. - Oh.

841
00:39:18,239 --> 00:39:20,083
Well, congratulations.
I'll see you in there.

842
00:39:20,107 --> 00:39:21,619
Thank you. Very
nice to meet you.

843
00:39:21,643 --> 00:39:24,043
Oh, uh, excuse me.

844
00:39:27,515 --> 00:39:29,148
Okay, great.

845
00:39:32,537 --> 00:39:35,171
<i>Cristina?</i> Mer, I made a mistake.

846
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,384
I don't want to be here
alone. You should be here.

847
00:39:37,408 --> 00:39:39,675
And we should be drunk.
Why aren't we drunk?

848
00:39:39,745 --> 00:39:41,878
And I want Owen
here. He could, like,

849
00:39:41,947 --> 00:39:44,013
hold my purse
and tell me things...

850
00:39:44,082 --> 00:39:47,550
Oh, my God. And tell
me to wear deodorant.

851
00:39:47,619 --> 00:39:49,919
I forgot to wear deodorant,
and now I stink and...

852
00:39:49,988 --> 00:39:53,256
<i>Where are you? Are you at
the table?</i> You know what?

853
00:39:53,324 --> 00:39:57,293
Forget it. I'm... I'm fine.

854
00:40:03,001 --> 00:40:06,236
<i>Surgeons are
trained to go it alone,</i>

855
00:40:06,304 --> 00:40:08,437
<i>to be solo artists,</i>

856
00:40:08,506 --> 00:40:11,674
<i>to be mavericks, both
in and out of the OR.</i>

857
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:16,429
<i>But the truth is,
we are never alone.</i>

858
00:40:21,402 --> 00:40:22,768
What?

859
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:30,225
Owen.

860
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:37,399
Oh, thank you.

861
00:40:38,402 --> 00:40:39,885
Thank you.

862
00:40:42,156 --> 00:40:43,439
Thanks.

863
00:40:43,508 --> 00:40:46,042
I finished my speech.
I have it right here.

864
00:40:46,111 --> 00:40:49,662
It took me six hours in a middle seat
with a mini bottle of overpriced tequila,

865
00:40:49,731 --> 00:40:51,826
but it's gracious
and not braggy.

866
00:40:51,850 --> 00:40:53,950
I think you'll like it.

867
00:40:54,018 --> 00:40:55,596
<i>We stand on the shoulders of</i>

868
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:57,620
<i>those who came before us.</i>

869
00:41:02,810 --> 00:41:08,063
<i>Surgery is the boldest and
most fearless of the healing arts.</i>

870
00:41:08,116 --> 00:41:11,551
<i>We stand side by side with the
colleagues who have supported us,</i>

871
00:41:11,619 --> 00:41:13,686
<i>prepared us...</i>

872
00:41:13,754 --> 00:41:15,399
<i>The Harper Avery
award celebrates</i>

873
00:41:15,423 --> 00:41:17,457
<i>those who have
destroyed the obstacles,</i>

874
00:41:18,793 --> 00:41:20,759
<i>altered the direction,</i>

875
00:41:20,828 --> 00:41:22,695
<i>and invented the future</i>

876
00:41:22,763 --> 00:41:28,334
<i>of how we are to live
and heal and thrive.</i>

877
00:41:28,402 --> 00:41:32,238
<i>The surgeons in this room
are redefining medicine</i>

878
00:41:32,306 --> 00:41:34,824
<i>for generations to come.</i>

879
00:41:34,892 --> 00:41:35,936
<i>For the moment that</i>

880
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,593
<i>every surgeon lives for...</i>

881
00:41:37,662 --> 00:41:39,674
<i>And so I am very
pleased to announce</i>

882
00:41:39,698 --> 00:41:41,230
<i>this year's winner.</i>

883
00:41:41,299 --> 00:41:45,151
<i>When it all comes down to
your training, your choices,</i>

884
00:41:45,219 --> 00:41:49,238
<i>your wits, your
hands, your stitch...</i>

885
00:41:49,307 --> 00:41:52,308
<i>The Harper Avery
award goes to...</i>

886
00:41:55,714 --> 00:41:58,274
<i>when it all comes down to you.</i>

887
00:42:00,135 --> 00:42:01,867
<i>Dr. Ronald Myers,</i>

888
00:42:01,937 --> 00:42:04,337
<i>Johns Hopkins Hospital.</i>
