1
00:00:04,405 --> 00:00:06,216
<i>Failure is an inevitability.</i>

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,706
Dr. Cristina Yang.

3
00:00:07,774 --> 00:00:09,694
Thank you, Dr. Hunt.

4
00:00:11,445 --> 00:00:12,811
The, uh...

5
00:00:14,581 --> 00:00:18,950
The procedure is
so relatively untried

6
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:25,224
that the associated
risks are unusually high.

7
00:00:25,292 --> 00:00:27,036
Still, that shouldn't
be a reason

8
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,577
not to try.

9
00:00:28,645 --> 00:00:30,729
<i>Every scientist was told no,</i>

10
00:00:31,515 --> 00:00:32,881
<i>over and over.</i>

11
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:39,232
You okay? CRISTINA: Yeah.

12
00:00:39,256 --> 00:00:42,924
Fortunately, the patient is
responding very well for now.

13
00:00:42,993 --> 00:00:46,612
His vitals remain
stable, and it is our hope

14
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,062
that this will continue.

15
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:52,517
And if it does, I am
cautiously optimistic

16
00:00:52,586 --> 00:00:55,337
that we can call this
procedure a success...

17
00:00:55,405 --> 00:00:56,549
Uh,

18
00:00:56,573 --> 00:00:58,674
"Homerun" is a better word.

19
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:01,043
Dr. Yang hit a homerun.

20
00:01:01,111 --> 00:01:04,463
Thanks to her, baby Nathan
is thriving this morning.

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,760
<i>The ones we remember.</i>

22
00:01:10,938 --> 00:01:12,778
<i>The ones who changed our lives.</i>

23
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:19,795
<i>The Curies, the
Salks, the Barnards.</i>

24
00:01:19,863 --> 00:01:21,429
We'll print another portal vein.

25
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:23,398
We'll perform tests
on that and look

26
00:01:23,466 --> 00:01:25,333
for material that
will hold up better.

27
00:01:25,402 --> 00:01:27,497
So we go back to
the drawing board?

28
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:30,221
<i>They're the ones who
wouldn't take no for an answer.</i>

29
00:01:30,291 --> 00:01:32,174
Yes, ma'am.

30
00:01:34,644 --> 00:01:36,311
Morning.

31
00:01:36,379 --> 00:01:39,059
Is that your name I see on
the OR board this afternoon?

32
00:01:39,083 --> 00:01:40,793
Well, it's just a cholie.
Getting my feet wet.

33
00:01:40,817 --> 00:01:42,429
You're gonna miss
Kepner's wedding?

34
00:01:42,453 --> 00:01:44,597
Well, I scheduled my first surgery
when everyone will be gone.

35
00:01:44,621 --> 00:01:46,137
I didn't want to
make a big fuss.

36
00:01:46,206 --> 00:01:48,067
You got a tumor debulking.

37
00:01:48,091 --> 00:01:50,470
You gonna be done in
time? I will be done on time.

38
00:01:50,494 --> 00:01:51,793
All right.

39
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:57,760
You're operating, too, huh?

40
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:59,017
The medication's helping?

41
00:01:59,086 --> 00:02:00,402
Mmm.

42
00:02:00,471 --> 00:02:02,203
I'm proud of you, Bailey.

43
00:02:02,272 --> 00:02:04,367
I don't want to make a big fuss.

44
00:02:07,678 --> 00:02:09,210
I thought that went pretty well.

45
00:02:09,279 --> 00:02:11,424
You're off my service. And
you've got to be over your hours.

46
00:02:11,448 --> 00:02:12,759
You should go home
and take a day off.

47
00:02:12,783 --> 00:02:13,916
What? What for?

48
00:02:13,984 --> 00:02:15,362
You don't know when
to keep your mouth shut.

49
00:02:15,386 --> 00:02:16,963
They needed to hear it
was an extraordinary...

50
00:02:16,987 --> 00:02:18,831
I am not comfortable
with you speaking for me,

51
00:02:18,855 --> 00:02:20,088
especially about this case.

52
00:02:20,157 --> 00:02:22,235
Ross actually said
what needed to be said.

53
00:02:22,259 --> 00:02:24,720
And you were not comfortable
at all. You were tanking in there.

54
00:02:24,744 --> 00:02:26,322
I'm only at 68 hours
for the week. See?

55
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:28,480
<i>JAMA</i> wants an interview.
It should be short.

56
00:02:28,549 --> 00:02:29,914
Conference room C.

57
00:02:31,668 --> 00:02:32,750
I'm worried about you.

58
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,553
You've been
going too fast lately.

59
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:36,466
And I'm not the only
one who noticed. Who?

60
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,000
It doesn't matter who.
Have I screwed up?

61
00:02:38,024 --> 00:02:39,119
Is my work not up to...

62
00:02:39,143 --> 00:02:40,825
No. Your work is great.

63
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:42,661
It's just, you're becoming...

64
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:46,047
You're going to
burn yourself out.

65
00:02:46,116 --> 00:02:47,710
I think I know what this is.

66
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:49,095
You just need to
work off some tension.

67
00:02:49,119 --> 00:02:50,985
We're not doing that anymore.

68
00:02:51,054 --> 00:02:52,932
If you're worried I think
it's more than it is, I don't.

69
00:02:52,956 --> 00:02:54,389
It's just to relax you.

70
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:57,209
It's you who needs to relax.

71
00:02:57,962 --> 00:02:59,042
I'm fine.

72
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:03,131
I'm sorry. Don't shut me out.

73
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,240
I'm fine.

74
00:03:05,201 --> 00:03:08,036
Ross, go home.

75
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:12,540
Okay, so first we determine

76
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:13,853
the receptive field of
all the sensors, right?

77
00:03:13,877 --> 00:03:15,454
Yeah. Okay.

78
00:03:15,478 --> 00:03:16,939
Derek, the guys from Kleiss
Neuroscience will be here in 20.

79
00:03:16,963 --> 00:03:18,290
I can't. Once I'm done here,

80
00:03:18,314 --> 00:03:19,692
I have to get Bailey
to a music class.

81
00:03:19,716 --> 00:03:20,843
Um, what's this?

82
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,145
They want to talk to me
about a research thing.

83
00:03:22,169 --> 00:03:23,402
It's not just a thing.

84
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,921
It is the presidential
initiative on brain mapping.

85
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:27,188
It is the thing.

86
00:03:27,257 --> 00:03:28,806
Okay. No.

87
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:31,409
We're starting phase two.
Okay? He's my brain now.

88
00:03:31,478 --> 00:03:32,922
Meredith can have
the rest. I get his brain.

89
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:34,523
I'll get rid of them.
No, you won't.

90
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:35,780
You will say yes to them.

91
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:37,510
And you're both gonna be
at Kepner's wedding, yes?

92
00:03:37,534 --> 00:03:38,678
Mmm-hmm. Uh-huh.

93
00:03:38,702 --> 00:03:41,080
I'm not going. Bailey's
doing surgery, finally.

94
00:03:41,104 --> 00:03:42,515
And I'd rather do that
than watch Arizona

95
00:03:42,539 --> 00:03:44,499
stand up there looking gorgeous,

96
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:46,553
while I'm some pathetic,
shriveled, leftover, discarded thing

97
00:03:46,577 --> 00:03:47,620
she scraped off her shoe.

98
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:48,688
Ew! No, don't do that.

99
00:03:48,712 --> 00:03:50,890
No! I know you think
this is just what I do.

100
00:03:50,914 --> 00:03:52,591
Oh, hey, hey! You're all
going to the wedding, right?

101
00:03:52,615 --> 00:03:54,499
Yes. Is it mandatory?

102
00:03:54,551 --> 00:03:56,562
This is exactly what you
do. Exactly what you do.

103
00:03:56,586 --> 00:03:58,786
I know what I do,
and this is not that.

104
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:00,889
She was important.

105
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:02,558
We were something.

106
00:04:04,194 --> 00:04:05,526
Maybe they were something.

107
00:04:06,296 --> 00:04:08,229
No. No.

108
00:04:08,298 --> 00:04:09,864
How's your dad?

109
00:04:09,933 --> 00:04:12,211
He's told all the nurses you're
his kid. He's proud. How is he?

110
00:04:12,235 --> 00:04:13,846
Don't know. Don't really care.

111
00:04:15,339 --> 00:04:18,473
Help! You gotta help my
boy! He's been run over!

112
00:04:18,542 --> 00:04:20,303
Sir, do not move!
Don't move him!

113
00:04:20,327 --> 00:04:21,420
No, no, no. Stop!
Stop! The gurney!

114
00:04:21,444 --> 00:04:23,045
Keep him still.
Backboard and C-spine!

115
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:25,847
He was driving the tractor.
He hit a bump and fell off.

116
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:27,727
He went under the wheel
and the chaser bin, too.

117
00:04:27,751 --> 00:04:29,034
Has he moved at all since?

118
00:04:29,086 --> 00:04:30,580
Yeah, yeah, he
was trying to get up.

119
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:31,798
Okay, let's get him
straight to the lodox.

120
00:04:31,822 --> 00:04:32,899
All right, let's go!
What's his name?

121
00:04:32,923 --> 00:04:34,622
Cody. His name's Cody.

122
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:36,825
Cody, I'm Dr. Robbins.
Can you hear me?

123
00:04:36,893 --> 00:04:38,003
You didn't call an ambulance?

124
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:39,639
I called 911. But
then he passed out,

125
00:04:39,663 --> 00:04:41,273
and I was so
scared, I couldn't wait.

126
00:04:41,297 --> 00:04:43,617
So I brought him here myself.

127
00:04:44,901 --> 00:04:46,012
You say he was moving before?

128
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:47,230
Yeah. That's good, right?

129
00:04:47,254 --> 00:04:48,781
Sir, I'm gonna need
you to step back.

130
00:04:48,805 --> 00:04:50,525
We're going to do
everything we can.

131
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:54,876
Uh, excuse me, Grey?

132
00:04:54,945 --> 00:04:56,628
Uh, the press would
like some photos

133
00:04:56,697 --> 00:04:58,413
of the printer. Is
this a good time?

134
00:04:58,499 --> 00:04:59,559
Oh, sure. Where do you want us?

135
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:01,016
Oh, well, it's actually...

136
00:05:01,084 --> 00:05:02,528
It's for the Nathan
Glazier case. So...

137
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:04,113
But it's printing my work.

138
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:07,122
Yeah, that's fine. I
mean, no one would know.

139
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:08,430
We can come back.

140
00:05:10,927 --> 00:05:12,327
Okay, right by the printer.

141
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:20,251
Oh, Dr. Yang, that's perfect.

142
00:05:34,935 --> 00:05:36,579
It's a burst fracture at C6.

143
00:05:36,603 --> 00:05:38,648
Page Torres. His belly's full of
blood. He's going to the OR now.

144
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:40,366
He should've waited
for the ambulance.

145
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:42,585
I think this guy paralyzed his own
kid by bringing him here himself.

146
00:05:42,609 --> 00:05:43,986
We don't know that
yet, Alex. I got this.

147
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,322
Why don't you go
be with your dad?

148
00:05:45,346 --> 00:05:46,756
That's all right. What?

149
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:48,507
You must have
questions. Long-lost father?

150
00:05:48,531 --> 00:05:49,775
I mean, I'd have a billion.

151
00:05:49,799 --> 00:05:51,039
Help me get him to the OR,

152
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:52,211
and then I'll call you
if I need you, okay?

153
00:05:52,235 --> 00:05:53,435
Let's go.

154
00:05:54,888 --> 00:05:55,931
Is he gonna be okay?

155
00:05:55,955 --> 00:05:57,233
He has a lot of
internal bleeding,

156
00:05:57,257 --> 00:05:58,468
so we need to
operate right away.

157
00:05:58,492 --> 00:06:00,036
Also, his neck is
broken. Oh, my God.

158
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,360
He can move, right?

159
00:06:02,429 --> 00:06:04,023
He was moving. That
was before he was...

160
00:06:04,047 --> 00:06:05,458
We'll know more
in a bit. We're doing

161
00:06:05,482 --> 00:06:07,562
everything that
we can. So sit tight.

162
00:06:12,922 --> 00:06:14,584
Ohh! Ugh!

163
00:06:14,608 --> 00:06:16,288
Wow, you look... Nope! No.

164
00:06:16,343 --> 00:06:17,887
Don't say I look nice.
Like a train wreck.

165
00:06:17,911 --> 00:06:19,155
But I can see where it's going.

166
00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:20,273
Um, what are you doing here?

167
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:21,512
I'm hunting bridesmaids.

168
00:06:21,582 --> 00:06:23,026
Now is that a farm tradition?

169
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:25,066
Are you gonna be there?

170
00:06:27,003 --> 00:06:28,447
All right. I totally
understand if you're not.

171
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:29,782
I just... Do you
want me to be there?

172
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:30,955
Yes! Of course.

173
00:06:31,007 --> 00:06:32,247
Then I'll be there.

174
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:34,626
Thank you.

175
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:35,922
All right. Okay.

176
00:06:35,946 --> 00:06:37,846
Wait. You know what?
Watch it. The hair is...

177
00:06:37,914 --> 00:06:40,081
Elliot Hooks, 20, here
for repeat debulking

178
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,517
of bronchial tumors.
This will be his...

179
00:06:42,585 --> 00:06:43,696
Wait, that can't be right.

180
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,336
It's right.

181
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,105
Three-hundred twelve surgeries.

182
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:48,723
I started treatments
when I was four.

183
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:50,058
His growths recur,

184
00:06:50,127 --> 00:06:52,471
build up and threaten
his larynx and lungs.

185
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:54,112
We have to laser them out.

186
00:06:54,181 --> 00:06:55,296
Every seven to 10 days.

187
00:06:55,365 --> 00:06:57,765
Three-hundred
twelve? That's rough.

188
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:58,950
I'm used to it.

189
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:00,801
My folks bought a
house a few blocks away.

190
00:07:00,871 --> 00:07:02,715
Kind of the way you move
close to the good school.

191
00:07:02,739 --> 00:07:04,734
No, we're not doing this.

192
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:06,135
Sorry? MIRANDA: Elliot...

193
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:09,177
What if I can culture
your tumor cells in a lab

194
00:07:09,246 --> 00:07:12,831
and custom design a drug
that can stop the growth,

195
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,933
find exactly the
medicine to stop them?

196
00:07:15,002 --> 00:07:16,634
And no surgery?

197
00:07:16,703 --> 00:07:18,436
No surgeries ever again.

198
00:07:18,505 --> 00:07:19,671
Oh, my God.

199
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:21,259
Right? Oh, my God.

200
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,793
You don't think this young
man's had enough surgery?

201
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,161
Yes, ma'am. I'm sorry.

202
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:29,430
Damn right, you're sorry.
Now let's go open up my lab.

203
00:07:29,883 --> 00:07:31,549
No!

204
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:33,501
I haven't had enough surgery.

205
00:07:33,569 --> 00:07:36,837
I have waited and waited
for you to get back in the OR,

206
00:07:36,907 --> 00:07:38,284
and damn it, enough is enough.

207
00:07:38,308 --> 00:07:41,326
I'm here to study surgery,
and I'm being left behind.

208
00:07:41,395 --> 00:07:42,972
And I deserve better than this.

209
00:07:42,996 --> 00:07:44,095
So I...

210
00:07:49,102 --> 00:07:50,234
I'm just tired.

211
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,303
Let's go.

212
00:07:52,372 --> 00:07:54,372
We need to do Elliot's
procedure once more

213
00:07:54,441 --> 00:07:56,140
to get the samples I need.

214
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:58,609
And you will perform
it, beginning to end.

215
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:00,344
Prep the man.

216
00:08:01,114 --> 00:08:02,380
Thank you.

217
00:08:02,448 --> 00:08:03,688
Watch yourself in there.

218
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,411
His breath in incredibly nasty.

219
00:08:05,435 --> 00:08:07,234
It's fine. It's not.

220
00:08:07,303 --> 00:08:08,570
It's rank.

221
00:08:08,638 --> 00:08:11,138
I can smell what
he ate last Tuesday.

222
00:08:11,207 --> 00:08:13,641
That is Zenker's diverticulum.

223
00:08:13,709 --> 00:08:15,805
Now these muscles here
should be working together

224
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:17,109
to push food down the esophagus.

225
00:08:18,465 --> 00:08:20,626
But unfortunately, Dalton's
are working against each other.

226
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:22,228
So the wall forms
a sack, and that's

227
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:23,880
where the food's getting caught.

228
00:08:23,904 --> 00:08:25,798
I always feel like I have
something caught in my throat.

229
00:08:25,822 --> 00:08:28,852
He got pneumonia once
from getting food in his lungs.

230
00:08:28,876 --> 00:08:30,036
He's a mess. I'm a mess.

231
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:31,587
Well, I'll be cutting
into the lower muscle,

232
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:33,845
so that'll allow the food
to pass right through.

233
00:08:33,914 --> 00:08:35,641
And the walls will
tighten up on their own.

234
00:08:35,665 --> 00:08:37,226
Anything we should worry about?

235
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,229
Well, of course, with all
surgeries there are certain risks,

236
00:08:39,253 --> 00:08:41,019
worst case being
stroke or even death.

237
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:43,037
But these are all very
minimal in this case.

238
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:44,367
There is a small risk of damage

239
00:08:44,391 --> 00:08:45,568
to the vocal cord
nerves, though.

240
00:08:45,592 --> 00:08:47,525
What, like, I won't
be able to talk?

241
00:08:47,594 --> 00:08:48,676
That's the worst case.

242
00:08:48,744 --> 00:08:49,984
It's very unlikely.

243
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:52,463
You have a cute butt.

244
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:53,898
Dalton!

245
00:08:53,967 --> 00:08:55,411
You heard the man. I
might not speak again.

246
00:08:55,435 --> 00:08:57,402
And I don't want to
leave anything unsaid.

247
00:08:58,671 --> 00:08:59,987
You have a sweet caboose.

248
00:09:00,056 --> 00:09:01,100
Also, I never
liked your brother.

249
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:02,490
What?

250
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:03,920
I also could have
kept that one to myself.

251
00:09:03,944 --> 00:09:05,226
But it felt good to say it.

252
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:08,574
You're an idiot. How soon
can you put him under?

253
00:09:08,598 --> 00:09:10,431
Ugh!

254
00:09:11,552 --> 00:09:12,817
There you are.

255
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:14,531
Yeah, she is the
magical healer of children.

256
00:09:14,555 --> 00:09:16,265
But you're done now, right?
You're done? Can we go?

257
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:17,366
Can we get one more?
Please come with me.

258
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,868
Why are you here?

259
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:20,269
Are you bailing on
your wedding? What?

260
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:22,304
No! I'm not bail... Why
would you say that?

261
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:23,695
No, I need you. Come with me.

262
00:09:23,763 --> 00:09:26,531
Gentlemen, as you
know, the President himself

263
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:28,877
has issued a mandate
for our community

264
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:30,746
to devise a full and complete

265
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:32,169
map of the human brain.

266
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:33,282
Kleiss Neuroscience
wants to lead

267
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:34,417
the pack towards that goal.

268
00:09:34,441 --> 00:09:36,173
We've got a huge
NIH grant to do it with.

269
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:38,610
The first steps will be
developing the technology.

270
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:40,812
The sensors you
developed for your BCI work

271
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,991
are the most
responsive we've seen.

272
00:09:42,015 --> 00:09:43,042
I'm flattered. Thank you.

273
00:09:43,066 --> 00:09:44,227
Wait till you see
what we're doing.

274
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:45,695
I'm afraid that Dr. Torres

275
00:09:45,719 --> 00:09:47,196
and my BCI work
is all-consuming.

276
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,720
I don't have the time.

277
00:09:48,789 --> 00:09:51,623
This will be the compensation
that you'll receive

278
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:53,807
just for consulting
long-distance.

279
00:09:53,876 --> 00:09:55,238
Okay, see, I'm not even
gonna turn that over.

280
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:57,622
It's not about the compensation.

281
00:09:58,898 --> 00:10:00,192
Turn over the
paper. I don't want to.

282
00:10:00,216 --> 00:10:02,211
Just turn it over. It's
not about the money.

283
00:10:02,235 --> 00:10:03,701
It's a lot of money.

284
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:04,585
I don't care how much
it is. It's not about that.

285
00:10:04,654 --> 00:10:05,586
Will you just watch our movie?

286
00:10:05,655 --> 00:10:08,156
Yes. Yes, he will.

287
00:10:08,224 --> 00:10:09,352
Just listen to what
they have to say.

288
00:10:09,376 --> 00:10:10,576
Absolutely.

289
00:10:14,798 --> 00:10:16,598
<i>Mapping the way to tomorrow.</i>

290
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:19,250
You want to watch
the movie? Here we go.

291
00:10:20,587 --> 00:10:22,988
Once more. Up.

292
00:10:25,158 --> 00:10:26,608
I'm too tired.

293
00:10:27,777 --> 00:10:28,893
Sorry, darling.

294
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:31,442
Could you, uh, give us a sec?

295
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:39,287
I got a question.

296
00:10:39,356 --> 00:10:41,284
I recognized you the
first time I saw you.

297
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:43,674
How do you forget a
wife and three kids?

298
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:46,177
How do you do that?

299
00:10:46,246 --> 00:10:48,445
I made such a
mess of everything.

300
00:10:48,514 --> 00:10:50,848
The more time went
by, the more drugs I did,

301
00:10:50,917 --> 00:10:52,583
the more I let
myself forget 'cause

302
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,235
I couldn't stand
myself, you know?

303
00:10:56,706 --> 00:10:58,522
I remember you, though.

304
00:10:58,591 --> 00:11:01,258
I remember you used
to laugh in your sleep.

305
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:02,738
Well, that's when I
was, like, four, right?

306
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:04,329
You were just a happy kid.

307
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:07,498
I guess I fixed that, huh?

308
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:12,553
Yeah, I remember you
took me to the fair once.

309
00:11:12,622 --> 00:11:14,366
It was one of
those traveling ones

310
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:16,686
where all the rides are
crappy and you might die.

311
00:11:18,495 --> 00:11:20,855
But, uh, we rode
every ride twice.

312
00:11:22,198 --> 00:11:24,118
It was a good night.
I remember that.

313
00:11:25,585 --> 00:11:27,079
Your mom was having a meltdown.

314
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,648
She was tearing the
wallpaper off the walls,

315
00:11:28,672 --> 00:11:30,112
saying someone
was hiding in there.

316
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:33,586
That woman was
such a damn mess...

317
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:35,321
What about this other family?

318
00:11:35,345 --> 00:11:37,090
I mean, how'd you
leave it with them?

319
00:11:37,114 --> 00:11:38,980
Better.

320
00:11:39,048 --> 00:11:40,481
I could maybe try and go back.

321
00:11:40,549 --> 00:11:42,416
Naomi's tough, but
she's not your mother.

322
00:11:42,486 --> 00:11:43,834
She's not bug-eyed crazy.

323
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:45,648
All right, this has
got to stop now.

324
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:47,938
Mom was not the problem.

325
00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:50,124
I'm not trying to
bad-talk your mother,

326
00:11:50,193 --> 00:11:53,027
but you can't know what a strain
it is being with someone like that.

327
00:11:53,095 --> 00:11:55,455
Who do you think
took care of her?

328
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:57,248
Kept track of her?

329
00:11:57,317 --> 00:12:00,063
Got her committed so
she wouldn't hurt herself?

330
00:12:00,087 --> 00:12:02,287
Who do you think
took care of your kids?

331
00:12:03,373 --> 00:12:04,738
I did the best I could.

332
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:07,153
Oh, well, if that's your best
then you should just hang it up!

333
00:12:07,177 --> 00:12:09,093
Your best is worthless!

334
00:12:09,162 --> 00:12:11,462
I was the dad!

335
00:12:11,531 --> 00:12:13,781
I was a kid, but I was the dad!

336
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:15,283
You were nothing!

337
00:12:15,352 --> 00:12:17,852
You were gone!

338
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,064
You're worthless!

339
00:12:19,088 --> 00:12:21,055
Okay! Okay, okay.

340
00:12:22,292 --> 00:12:23,624
Walk away.

341
00:12:30,717 --> 00:12:33,284
Okay, I can fuse C5 and
6, but I have to work fast

342
00:12:33,352 --> 00:12:35,330
if we even want a shot
at avoiding paralysis.

343
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:37,082
Oh, thank you. You're
a genius. 10 blade.

344
00:12:37,106 --> 00:12:39,152
I am, actually, well,
sort of a genius.

345
00:12:39,176 --> 00:12:40,736
Derek and I start
phase two today,

346
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,738
tactile pressure feedback.

347
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,006
Awesome! Good for you.

348
00:12:45,232 --> 00:12:46,542
Well, it's good for you, too.

349
00:12:46,566 --> 00:12:48,377
The goal is a prosthetic leg

350
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:51,330
as sensitive and as responsive
as the one that you lost.

351
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:53,533
Get you back to where you were.

352
00:12:53,557 --> 00:12:56,157
Okay, um, prep the
neck. I'm gonna scrub.

353
00:12:57,376 --> 00:12:59,171
Hey, I told you I'd
call you if I need you.

354
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:00,839
How's your dad?
Where do you want me?

355
00:13:04,501 --> 00:13:06,550
Grab a clamp. Help
me find the bleeders.

356
00:13:10,723 --> 00:13:11,768
Meredith!

357
00:13:11,792 --> 00:13:12,935
April, what are you doing?

358
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,659
Oh, God. Are you
making a break for it?

359
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:16,906
Don't worry. I know
what to do. Really?

360
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:18,340
Why does everybody
think I'm running?

361
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:20,292
I'm not running. Come with me.

362
00:13:20,316 --> 00:13:21,410
But I... No.

363
00:13:21,434 --> 00:13:23,246
You bailed on every
single one of your

364
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:25,470
fittings for your
bridesmaid's dress, so,

365
00:13:25,539 --> 00:13:27,600
I brought the seamstress to you.

366
00:13:27,624 --> 00:13:29,101
You will look pretty
for my wedding.

367
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:31,342
Hello. No clothes, please.

368
00:13:33,847 --> 00:13:36,431
You guys are supposed
to be doing this stuff for me.

369
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:42,403
I saw your, uh,
press conference.

370
00:13:42,472 --> 00:13:44,906
What happened to you up there?

371
00:13:44,974 --> 00:13:48,193
I was supposed to tell them
what I did, but I'm not totally sure.

372
00:13:48,944 --> 00:13:50,294
What do you mean?

373
00:13:50,363 --> 00:13:51,640
I'm not sure why
the kid is still alive.

374
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,208
The conduit? You
thought it would fail?

375
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:56,550
It did fail. We adjusted, but
I don't know what I did, Mer.

376
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:58,602
It's like slapping
the side of a TV.

377
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,683
I fixed it, but
I'm not sure how.

378
00:14:00,707 --> 00:14:03,023
I feel like a complete fraud.

379
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:04,725
So you just went ahead anyway?

380
00:14:04,794 --> 00:14:06,961
I mean, you didn't
mention that to anyone?

381
00:14:07,029 --> 00:14:10,097
To who, Mer? You weren't
talking to me, Alex was against me.

382
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:14,869
I had no one. I had no
choice. It was his best shot.

383
00:14:17,574 --> 00:14:19,039
Wow. You were right.

384
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:22,593
We are in two completely
different places.

385
00:14:22,662 --> 00:14:24,523
Mer, please. No, I
mean, I may overreach,

386
00:14:24,547 --> 00:14:26,347
and I may have
something to prove, but...

387
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:30,201
I will never be as
arrogant as you are.

388
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:31,510
You know what, Meredith?

389
00:14:32,489 --> 00:14:33,704
Go to hell.

390
00:14:33,773 --> 00:14:35,718
I have listened to your
crap for weeks now,

391
00:14:35,742 --> 00:14:37,975
and I'm not gonna stand
here and take it anymore.

392
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:39,693
You stand here.

393
00:14:39,762 --> 00:14:41,340
<i>And that's why at
Kleiss Neuroscience</i>

394
00:14:41,364 --> 00:14:43,864
<i>tomorrow is today.</i>

395
00:14:43,933 --> 00:14:46,134
Well? Very impressive.

396
00:14:46,202 --> 00:14:48,619
Like I said, I'm overextended.

397
00:14:48,688 --> 00:14:50,616
Derek, they're just
asking for a consult.

398
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,817
This is not a relocation, right?

399
00:14:51,841 --> 00:14:53,307
No, no, no, no, no.

400
00:14:53,376 --> 00:14:55,237
Just, it'd be a couple of
visits every couple of months.

401
00:14:55,261 --> 00:14:57,256
Once again, I'm flattered, but
I... I just don't have the time.

402
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,491
Just guide us in
what we're doing.

403
00:14:58,515 --> 00:15:00,125
Not if this is
what you're doing.

404
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:01,660
Wait, you think that there's
something wrong with our approach?

405
00:15:01,684 --> 00:15:03,128
Our method is the
bleeding edge of...

406
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:05,130
Your method couldn't
map the human sphincter.

407
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:06,503
Derek.

408
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:09,052
I'm sorry, but they made me.

409
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,758
You're looking at a planet.

410
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:13,194
I'm saying step back

411
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:15,270
and look at the universe.

412
00:15:17,817 --> 00:15:20,901
You don't kiss someone
by puckering your lips.

413
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:25,022
You see someone and you
remember why you desire them.

414
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:27,486
Your sympathetic nervous
system quickens your pulse,

415
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,288
your frontal lobe
lowers your inhibitions,

416
00:15:29,312 --> 00:15:31,612
and you need to kiss them.

417
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:33,047
It happens all at once.

418
00:15:33,116 --> 00:15:36,717
We're impulsive and compulsive.

419
00:15:36,786 --> 00:15:37,946
That's how the brain works.

420
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:40,004
Stop looking at what we do.

421
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:41,722
Look at why we do it.

422
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:43,586
Is he saying change
the sensor placement?

423
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,420
No, you don't get it, Tim.
- I want to.

424
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:47,511
He's saying change everything.

425
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,413
He is saying... Where are you...

426
00:15:49,482 --> 00:15:51,293
That this diffuser/tensor
imaging is old news.

427
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:52,394
He's saying that
cortical firing...

428
00:15:52,418 --> 00:15:53,718
They're starting to get it.

429
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:57,438
Deeper cuts and faster
pictures of the whole brain.

430
00:15:57,507 --> 00:16:00,641
Oh, you know that dress,
the purple one with the stripes?

431
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:01,710
Yeah.

432
00:16:01,778 --> 00:16:02,821
It does make you look fat.

433
00:16:02,845 --> 00:16:03,928
What?

434
00:16:03,997 --> 00:16:05,747
You said it was pretty. I lied.

435
00:16:05,815 --> 00:16:08,043
But I want my last
words to be honest ones.

436
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:10,484
You are gorgeous.
But in that dress...

437
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:12,515
Bastard. you look
like a parade float.

438
00:16:12,539 --> 00:16:14,249
I wore that dress
to three weddings.

439
00:16:16,776 --> 00:16:19,059
It's our song. Last chance, hon.

440
00:16:21,163 --> 00:16:23,109
Guys, the risk of damage to
your vocal chords are so minimal...

441
00:16:23,133 --> 00:16:25,733
Cut them. Cut
the chords, please.

442
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:28,335
Uh, this is your
last stop, Karen.

443
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:29,604
Hey.

444
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:30,962
Come here.

445
00:16:45,989 --> 00:16:47,087
I'll see you after.

446
00:16:54,464 --> 00:16:56,104
<i>Move it more laterally.</i>

447
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:58,282
There.

448
00:16:58,351 --> 00:16:59,417
Got it.

449
00:17:02,055 --> 00:17:03,754
I owe you an apology.

450
00:17:03,823 --> 00:17:05,301
I shouldn't have
spoken to you that way.

451
00:17:05,325 --> 00:17:07,645
Why? You got what you wanted.

452
00:17:08,294 --> 00:17:09,660
And you were right.

453
00:17:09,729 --> 00:17:13,164
Part of my job is to teach you.

454
00:17:13,233 --> 00:17:14,949
I haven't been doing that.

455
00:17:15,018 --> 00:17:18,152
I wasn't sure if I was
being rewarded or punished.

456
00:17:18,221 --> 00:17:19,787
Part of my mystique.

457
00:17:19,856 --> 00:17:21,622
Oh, get that one.

458
00:17:25,578 --> 00:17:28,579
Never be afraid to
stand up for yourself.

459
00:17:28,648 --> 00:17:31,165
Just be sure you're
right when you do.

460
00:17:31,233 --> 00:17:34,168
That's so true.

461
00:17:34,236 --> 00:17:36,671
I have to stand up
for what I deserve.

462
00:17:36,739 --> 00:17:39,006
That is so incredibly true...

463
00:17:39,074 --> 00:17:41,287
I know, I said it.
You missed that one.

464
00:17:41,311 --> 00:17:43,710
You tell me how
you can give 100%

465
00:17:43,779 --> 00:17:46,079
to your family and
100% to your job.

466
00:17:46,149 --> 00:17:48,148
It's categorically impossible...

467
00:17:48,217 --> 00:17:49,695
Because you keep
screwing with my research.

468
00:17:49,719 --> 00:17:51,719
Oh, God, Mer.

469
00:17:51,788 --> 00:17:54,083
My borrowing your printer had
nothing to do with your dead sheep.

470
00:17:54,107 --> 00:17:56,285
Did you ever think maybe your
research is failing all on its own?

471
00:17:56,309 --> 00:17:58,754
Right, because I'm a terrible
doctor. We've established that.

472
00:17:58,778 --> 00:17:59,927
No, I never said that.

473
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:02,062
You said that...
I never said that!

474
00:18:02,131 --> 00:18:05,165
But you said I was
a terrible person,

475
00:18:05,234 --> 00:18:07,601
over and over,

476
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:09,436
because I don't agree with you.

477
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:11,405
Because I'm
committed to my work.

478
00:18:11,473 --> 00:18:13,774
Because I don't want a baby?

479
00:18:13,843 --> 00:18:16,727
When did I become
such a monster to you?

480
00:18:16,796 --> 00:18:18,089
- Can I talk to you?
- Ugh.

481
00:18:18,113 --> 00:18:19,179
Shane, go away.

482
00:18:19,248 --> 00:18:20,164
I thought they should
hear what you did,

483
00:18:20,233 --> 00:18:21,259
and you downplayed it.

484
00:18:21,283 --> 00:18:22,411
Shane, I said get out! Go home!

485
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:23,984
And I was right.

486
00:18:24,053 --> 00:18:25,219
What?

487
00:18:25,287 --> 00:18:26,499
An e-mail from the Harper Avery

488
00:18:26,523 --> 00:18:27,421
Foundation
requesting a case study

489
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:28,684
and patient status. What?

490
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:31,148
You're in consideration
for this year's award.

491
00:18:35,598 --> 00:18:38,115
Now you take off,
and you take off.

492
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,502
Are you gonna wear
your high-heel leg?

493
00:18:47,526 --> 00:18:50,305
'Cause it looks amazing. But you
always get so sore after a while.

494
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:52,057
Also, it's on a farm,
so it might be muddy.

495
00:18:52,081 --> 00:18:53,081
I'll be fine.

496
00:18:53,148 --> 00:18:54,298
Okay.

497
00:18:54,367 --> 00:18:55,678
Were you able to
decompress the cord?

498
00:18:55,702 --> 00:18:56,734
Is he paralyzed?

499
00:18:56,803 --> 00:18:58,180
Uh! It's too soon to tell.

500
00:18:58,204 --> 00:18:59,581
You gonna tell the dad?
- Tell the dad what?

501
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:01,049
The spinal injury was likely

502
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:02,534
caused by the father
transporting him.

503
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:03,902
Oh, God. You wait
for an ambulance.

504
00:19:03,926 --> 00:19:05,309
Well, he didn't know.

505
00:19:05,378 --> 00:19:06,805
Yeah, well, and now
maybe his kid might not walk?

506
00:19:06,829 --> 00:19:08,106
I mean, he would
have been better off

507
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:09,341
if he had just
kept his hands off.

508
00:19:09,365 --> 00:19:10,631
Callie, stop it.

509
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,377
His kid was hurt, and
he was trying to fix it.

510
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:13,745
Sometimes we try
to make things better

511
00:19:13,769 --> 00:19:16,181
and we have no idea that
we're actually causing more pain.

512
00:19:16,205 --> 00:19:17,504
Of course we don't tell him.

513
00:19:19,475 --> 00:19:21,375
No.

514
00:19:21,444 --> 00:19:22,854
I can't get in there to staple.

515
00:19:22,878 --> 00:19:25,279
There's too many strictures.

516
00:19:25,348 --> 00:19:28,109
All right. I'm gonna
go in through his neck.

517
00:19:29,435 --> 00:19:31,368
Okay. Yeah.

518
00:19:31,437 --> 00:19:32,903
There you go.

519
00:19:34,691 --> 00:19:36,201
What do you think
he said to her?

520
00:19:36,225 --> 00:19:37,557
No idea.

521
00:19:37,627 --> 00:19:38,804
Though, I don't
think there's much

522
00:19:38,828 --> 00:19:39,938
they wouldn't say to each other.

523
00:19:39,962 --> 00:19:41,529
Right? How do you
get to that point?

524
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:43,458
There's nothing I wouldn't
say to you. Oh, I doubt that.

525
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:44,898
We are nowhere near that point.

526
00:19:44,967 --> 00:19:46,600
You shed.

527
00:19:46,669 --> 00:19:48,246
You shed hair. You shed bras.

528
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:50,654
That is untrue and unkind.

529
00:19:50,723 --> 00:19:52,100
You stay over my
place for the weekend,

530
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:53,301
and there's hair all
over every pillow,

531
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:55,103
and a bra on every door knob.

532
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:56,805
You got a bra in my
silverware drawer.

533
00:19:56,829 --> 00:19:58,707
Which one? Was it blue?
How do you have so many bras?

534
00:19:58,731 --> 00:20:01,265
Well, you have angry face.

535
00:20:01,334 --> 00:20:02,533
I have angry face?

536
00:20:02,602 --> 00:20:04,312
Yeah, when you are
thinking or solving a problem

537
00:20:04,336 --> 00:20:06,531
or just counting change,
people think you're pissed off.

538
00:20:06,555 --> 00:20:07,699
Well, I'm not pissed off.

539
00:20:07,723 --> 00:20:08,967
Well, I know.
It's just your face.

540
00:20:08,991 --> 00:20:10,991
I'm getting pissed off.
Then you should smile more.

541
00:20:12,227 --> 00:20:14,278
You have a beautiful smile.

542
00:20:18,501 --> 00:20:19,928
I think he said he loved her.

543
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:21,080
Maybe.

544
00:20:22,171 --> 00:20:23,965
Say it loud and go from there.

545
00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:25,256
What?

546
00:20:25,325 --> 00:20:27,336
No, it's something Mark
Sloan said to me once.

547
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,470
He's ready, Doctors.

548
00:20:28,494 --> 00:20:31,561
He said, "If you love somebody,

549
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:35,065
"you tell 'em, even if you're
scared it'll cause problems

550
00:20:35,134 --> 00:20:37,184
"or burn your
life to the ground.

551
00:20:37,253 --> 00:20:39,237
"Say it loud and go from there."

552
00:20:39,305 --> 00:20:41,238
That's nice.

553
00:20:46,262 --> 00:20:47,262
Oh, my God!

554
00:20:48,731 --> 00:20:50,971
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?

555
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:53,033
I'm working. On our wedding day?

556
00:20:53,101 --> 00:20:55,197
I have to earn enough to take
time off after our wedding day.

557
00:20:55,221 --> 00:20:57,199
You saw me. Barely.

558
00:20:57,223 --> 00:20:59,000
I didn't see your dress.
I didn't see your hair.

559
00:20:59,024 --> 00:21:00,236
Do you have a really big hat on?

560
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:02,971
This is such bad
luck! Such bad luck!

561
00:21:02,995 --> 00:21:04,256
No, no, no, no, no. No.

562
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,646
It's good. It's good, 'cause...

563
00:21:07,049 --> 00:21:08,377
If the first time
I saw you today

564
00:21:08,401 --> 00:21:09,644
was in the dress with the hair,

565
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:11,235
looking that beautiful,

566
00:21:11,304 --> 00:21:15,005
I would just be reminded of
how much I don't deserve you,

567
00:21:15,074 --> 00:21:16,824
and I'd probably pass out.

568
00:21:16,892 --> 00:21:18,937
And we'd wind up back
here. We wouldn't be married.

569
00:21:18,961 --> 00:21:21,321
They'd have to cut off my
suit, and I'm still paying for it.

570
00:21:25,434 --> 00:21:27,835
I'm glad I saw you like this,

571
00:21:27,904 --> 00:21:29,648
'cause I'm gonna see
you like this a lot more

572
00:21:29,672 --> 00:21:32,056
than I'll see you like that
for the rest of our lives.

573
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:33,724
And I love you like this.

574
00:21:35,227 --> 00:21:36,560
I love you, too.

575
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:39,329
I can't wait.

576
00:21:40,867 --> 00:21:43,148
Oh! Hey, don't
forget black socks.

577
00:21:45,104 --> 00:21:46,870
Matthew?

578
00:21:53,078 --> 00:21:54,444
Matthew?

579
00:21:54,514 --> 00:21:57,481
It's possible the lack of
nerve response is due to

580
00:21:57,550 --> 00:22:00,217
uh, trauma and swelling
to the spinal cord.

581
00:22:00,286 --> 00:22:02,386
It could recede with time.

582
00:22:02,455 --> 00:22:04,254
And if it doesn't?

583
00:22:07,126 --> 00:22:10,227
We're looking at paralysis,
likely quadriplegia.

584
00:22:11,397 --> 00:22:13,877
We'll have to wait and see.

585
00:22:15,952 --> 00:22:18,836
It's my fault, isn't it?

586
00:22:20,856 --> 00:22:22,723
He was moving when it happened.

587
00:22:24,143 --> 00:22:25,810
Then I brought him here.

588
00:22:27,046 --> 00:22:28,378
I did this.

589
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:30,781
I did this to him.

590
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:32,717
You were trying to help him.

591
00:22:32,785 --> 00:22:35,145
Whatever happens,
it's not your fault.

592
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:37,468
Look, you were just trying
to do your best for your kid.

593
00:22:37,823 --> 00:22:38,855
Okay?

594
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:47,464
Well, unfortunately, I wasn't
able to access the diverticulum

595
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:49,499
with the scope, so
we went in surgically.

596
00:22:49,568 --> 00:22:53,136
But it went seamlessly and he
is gonna have very fresh breath.

597
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:55,472
Thank you. He's waking up.

598
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:57,207
All right.

599
00:22:57,276 --> 00:22:58,575
Hi, honey.

600
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,529
What's wrong with him?

601
00:23:02,597 --> 00:23:03,826
Page Shepherd right away.

602
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:05,176
Dalton?

603
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,283
Excuse me.

604
00:23:06,352 --> 00:23:07,484
Dalton?

605
00:23:08,737 --> 00:23:10,838
I can compete as a
mother and as a surgeon.

606
00:23:10,907 --> 00:23:12,717
You just don't think I
can compete against you.

607
00:23:12,741 --> 00:23:15,776
You can't, because,
Mer, this is all I do.

608
00:23:15,845 --> 00:23:17,344
This is all I want to do.

609
00:23:17,413 --> 00:23:18,957
So don't whine to me because you

610
00:23:18,981 --> 00:23:20,458
made a decision you regret now.

611
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:21,748
You think I regret my family?

612
00:23:21,818 --> 00:23:25,052
I think you feel left behind
and that sucks for you,

613
00:23:25,121 --> 00:23:26,703
but no one forced
you out of the game.

614
00:23:26,772 --> 00:23:28,105
I am not out of the game!

615
00:23:28,173 --> 00:23:30,219
I just won't sabotage
my friends to win it!

616
00:23:30,243 --> 00:23:31,409
Oh. Oh, is that what I do?

617
00:23:31,477 --> 00:23:32,543
That's what sharks do.

618
00:23:32,612 --> 00:23:33,944
You called it our first day.

619
00:23:34,013 --> 00:23:36,781
Well, as I recall, I
was talking about you.

620
00:23:36,849 --> 00:23:39,249
How long have you
been sleeping with Shane?

621
00:23:42,371 --> 00:23:44,205
He blushes at an exposed ankle.

622
00:23:44,273 --> 00:23:46,373
He saw you in your
underwear and didn't bat an eye.

623
00:23:46,441 --> 00:23:48,742
That is none of your business!

624
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:50,570
You don't have
to justify it to me.

625
00:23:50,612 --> 00:23:52,156
He's just hooking up
with the best teacher

626
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:54,381
to make sure he can
get everything he can.

627
00:23:54,449 --> 00:23:57,369
It's what you did all through med
school and all through intern year.

628
00:23:57,869 --> 00:23:58,986
Congratulations.

629
00:23:59,055 --> 00:24:00,632
You've become the
thing you worship.

630
00:24:00,656 --> 00:24:04,176
And you became the
thing we laughed at.

631
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,652
Hey.

632
00:24:17,423 --> 00:24:19,723
I'm sorry. I... You
don't have to be sorry.

633
00:24:19,775 --> 00:24:21,275
I mean, it's like you said.

634
00:24:21,344 --> 00:24:22,709
You did your best, and...

635
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:26,039
I turned out all right, so...

636
00:24:26,949 --> 00:24:28,065
Thanks.

637
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:34,204
I just want my family
again. We're not family.

638
00:24:34,273 --> 00:24:36,668
All right, I turned out
all right because you left.

639
00:24:36,692 --> 00:24:39,437
Aaron and Amber and Mom,
they're okay now because you left.

640
00:24:39,461 --> 00:24:42,796
If you'd stayed, I'd probably
be selling beer or something.

641
00:24:42,882 --> 00:24:47,351
Or maybe I would've followed in
your footsteps and ODed by now.

642
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:50,955
But you left us, thank God. So
you can stop beating yourself up.

643
00:24:56,345 --> 00:24:58,879
Maybe you can fix it
with your kid in Florida.

644
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:01,481
Good luck with that.

645
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:04,078
Bye, Jimmy.

646
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,755
He had a massive stroke.

647
00:25:24,823 --> 00:25:26,463
It could've
dislodged a blood clot

648
00:25:26,491 --> 00:25:28,542
in the carotid
during the surgery.

649
00:25:28,611 --> 00:25:31,706
It's a rare outcome for any
surgery, but it does happen.

650
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:33,575
We will pursue every avenue for

651
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:35,343
rehabilitation, but
I'm afraid that...

652
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:36,433
You can't fix it?

653
00:25:38,987 --> 00:25:40,153
I'm sorry.

654
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:50,230
So he's awake, but...

655
00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:51,799
He can't speak?

656
00:25:51,867 --> 00:25:53,967
Not at this point, no.

657
00:25:54,036 --> 00:25:57,487
But we will do everything
that we can for him, Karen.

658
00:25:58,741 --> 00:26:00,691
I am so sorry.

659
00:26:03,796 --> 00:26:04,928
Dalton.

660
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,813
Honey?

661
00:26:07,916 --> 00:26:09,483
Can he hear me?

662
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:11,801
We're not sure.

663
00:26:36,628 --> 00:26:38,156
Was it something we did?

664
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,746
No.

665
00:26:39,815 --> 00:26:41,781
It was totally
unforeseen. It's...

666
00:26:48,473 --> 00:26:49,723
I...

667
00:26:51,677 --> 00:26:53,260
What? What's that?

668
00:26:53,328 --> 00:26:55,796
Nothing. Mmm, nothing.

669
00:26:58,651 --> 00:27:00,394
Hey. You're not going
to the wedding, right?

670
00:27:00,418 --> 00:27:01,551
Can you cover my patients?

671
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,153
No, I am going,

672
00:27:03,221 --> 00:27:05,399
because when you stand up
for what you deserve, you get it.

673
00:27:05,423 --> 00:27:06,990
And I deserve her.

674
00:27:07,059 --> 00:27:08,569
I am not gonna be thrown aside.

675
00:27:08,593 --> 00:27:09,776
I am going to that wedding,

676
00:27:09,845 --> 00:27:11,489
and I am going to stand
up in front of everyone,

677
00:27:11,513 --> 00:27:13,096
and I'm gonna tell
Arizona how I feel,

678
00:27:13,165 --> 00:27:15,198
and she's gonna be
forced to deal with it.

679
00:27:15,251 --> 00:27:17,850
And I sound crazy.

680
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:19,679
And this is the thing,
the thing that I do!

681
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:20,921
Yeah, it is!

682
00:27:20,956 --> 00:27:24,007
Thank you! Thank you
for not letting me do that.

683
00:27:24,926 --> 00:27:26,359
I got your patients.

684
00:27:26,429 --> 00:27:27,794
Thank you.

685
00:27:29,265 --> 00:27:30,897
Oh, crap! What?

686
00:27:30,966 --> 00:27:32,377
I just told Jo that
I would cover her,

687
00:27:32,401 --> 00:27:34,178
and I'm already at my
80 hours for the week.

688
00:27:34,202 --> 00:27:35,980
Oh, I can fix that.
Put in your password.

689
00:27:37,139 --> 00:27:38,672
Just go to "Menu."

690
00:27:38,741 --> 00:27:40,585
Down here is "Manual input."

691
00:27:40,609 --> 00:27:42,876
Let's put you at 60.

692
00:27:42,945 --> 00:27:44,010
You do this?

693
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:46,046
I can't believe you don't.

694
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:49,116
When do you sleep?

695
00:27:49,184 --> 00:27:52,018
Oh, Hunt, Avery's stroke
patient is in my care.

696
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:53,364
You're gonna go to
the wedding, right?

697
00:27:53,388 --> 00:27:54,850
'Cause you've been yelling
at people all day today.

698
00:27:54,874 --> 00:27:57,986
Yeah, I'm gonna change and
get Emma. Derek, the Kleiss guys?

699
00:27:58,010 --> 00:27:59,471
It wasn't enough just
to turn them down?

700
00:27:59,495 --> 00:28:01,873
You had to tear down
everything that they're doing?

701
00:28:01,897 --> 00:28:04,548
Do you think I don't want
to help them? It's bad timing.

702
00:28:04,617 --> 00:28:06,160
And you need me to
keep my focus here.

703
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:07,328
I know. I do, but...

704
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:09,231
To turn this place
into an innovation hub.

705
00:28:09,255 --> 00:28:11,154
It is a call to serve, Derek.

706
00:28:11,223 --> 00:28:12,934
It is a presidential initiative.

707
00:28:12,958 --> 00:28:14,803
The President asks you to serve?

708
00:28:14,827 --> 00:28:17,611
You serve. You do
what is asked of you.

709
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:20,013
Well, your service was
a calling and a sacrifice.

710
00:28:20,081 --> 00:28:23,784
But this is about guys just trying
to score some government money

711
00:28:23,852 --> 00:28:25,297
and stacking the
deck with my name.

712
00:28:25,321 --> 00:28:27,488
I appreciate how you
feel. I do. But this?

713
00:28:28,257 --> 00:28:29,406
This isn't that.

714
00:28:34,046 --> 00:28:36,046
ARIZONA: Oh!

715
00:28:36,265 --> 00:28:38,799
So pretty.

716
00:28:38,868 --> 00:28:42,870
Hey, um, after this is over, I
want to have a toast to celebrate.

717
00:28:42,938 --> 00:28:44,905
Oh. There'll be
plenty of toasts.

718
00:28:44,974 --> 00:28:46,907
No, no, no. For phase two.

719
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:48,152
Ah.

720
00:28:48,176 --> 00:28:50,272
Your research.
Well, our research.

721
00:28:50,296 --> 00:28:51,706
It's yours, too.
You inspired it.

722
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,274
I wouldn't be
doing it without you.

723
00:28:53,298 --> 00:28:55,160
Okay.

724
00:28:56,352 --> 00:28:58,112
Are you crying?
Yeah. You know...

725
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,971
Weddings.

726
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,906
Yeah. Come on.

727
00:29:02,974 --> 00:29:05,534
At their engagement party,
I mean, I kind of knew...

728
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:09,162
Oh!

729
00:29:09,231 --> 00:29:11,381
"Mint to be." Cute!

730
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:12,783
What is in these?

731
00:29:12,851 --> 00:29:15,502
Oh, we're supposed to
open those when they kiss.

732
00:29:16,622 --> 00:29:17,622
Nice.

733
00:29:17,689 --> 00:29:19,289
You just ruined
Kepner's wedding.

734
00:29:19,324 --> 00:29:21,004
Huh? Come on.

735
00:29:21,043 --> 00:29:23,877
So I spent all day in the lab.

736
00:29:23,946 --> 00:29:26,863
It'll take a few weeks, but
I think I can cure this kid.

737
00:29:26,932 --> 00:29:28,982
Medically. You
know, once and for all.

738
00:29:29,051 --> 00:29:31,029
What's going on
with you, Miranda?

739
00:29:31,053 --> 00:29:33,214
You're handing surgeries
over to residents.

740
00:29:33,238 --> 00:29:34,716
You're back in your
lab, where you hid

741
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:36,151
when you first
got that infection.

742
00:29:36,175 --> 00:29:37,524
Hey, what are you saying?

743
00:29:37,593 --> 00:29:40,093
Well, I'm worried
you're quitting surgery.

744
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:43,046
I see.

745
00:29:44,216 --> 00:29:45,582
Okay.

746
00:29:46,918 --> 00:29:49,953
While we're on the
subject of quitting surgery,

747
00:29:50,022 --> 00:29:51,955
maybe it's time we talked about,

748
00:29:52,024 --> 00:29:53,890
uh, why the hell you
up and quit surgery.

749
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:57,861
Look, I told you, I want
my family. I need to be here.

750
00:29:57,929 --> 00:29:59,073
Hell, look at you.

751
00:29:59,097 --> 00:30:00,308
Do you think we'd
have gotten this

752
00:30:00,332 --> 00:30:02,772
under control if I
hadn't been here?

753
00:30:03,668 --> 00:30:08,371
Did it ever occur to you
that my symptoms got worse

754
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,840
when you showed up

755
00:30:10,676 --> 00:30:11,925
having quit your job?

756
00:30:12,795 --> 00:30:14,077
Okay.

757
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:16,430
So, that's what
we're saying, is it?

758
00:30:16,498 --> 00:30:18,458
Thing's about to start. Mmm-hmm.

759
00:30:19,718 --> 00:30:21,678
Mr. Evans?

760
00:30:21,703 --> 00:30:24,154
Mr. Evans?

761
00:30:24,223 --> 00:30:27,940
He's having an MI, get
an EKG and a crash cart.

762
00:30:32,631 --> 00:30:34,871
You look so beautiful.

763
00:30:36,268 --> 00:30:38,368
Aw! That's really sweet.

764
00:30:38,437 --> 00:30:42,906
But, uh, you're gonna be
all puffy if you keep that up.

765
00:30:42,974 --> 00:30:44,586
Are you gonna get it together?

766
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:45,809
Yeah.

767
00:30:45,878 --> 00:30:47,393
No, I'm sorry.

768
00:30:47,463 --> 00:30:52,215
Callie's trying so hard to
forgive me and to take care of me,

769
00:30:52,284 --> 00:30:54,234
and it's driving me crazy.

770
00:30:54,303 --> 00:30:55,480
I thought you wanted...

771
00:30:55,504 --> 00:30:56,686
I do! I do.

772
00:30:56,755 --> 00:30:58,032
I love her and I want her back.

773
00:30:58,056 --> 00:31:00,857
And I broke us.
And I want to fix it.

774
00:31:00,926 --> 00:31:02,909
But she wants to fix me.

775
00:31:02,978 --> 00:31:06,330
The reason that I
cheated that night...

776
00:31:06,398 --> 00:31:10,383
Someone was attracted to me.
And she never knew me before.

777
00:31:10,452 --> 00:31:12,919
She only knew me after.

778
00:31:12,988 --> 00:31:14,570
And I was enough for her.

779
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:17,991
And Callie she knew me
before and she loved me before.

780
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:21,761
And now sometimes
I feel like I'm not...

781
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:23,575
I'm not... You're not?

782
00:31:23,599 --> 00:31:25,666
It's not fair.

783
00:31:25,734 --> 00:31:27,684
It's not fair. It's
not her fault.

784
00:31:27,752 --> 00:31:30,287
It's not her fault that I
hate feeling this way.

785
00:31:30,355 --> 00:31:33,090
And Callie's just... She's
trying to fix everything.

786
00:31:33,158 --> 00:31:35,475
And I'm finally feeling
okay the way that I am now!

787
00:31:35,544 --> 00:31:38,828
And I'm not sure that Callie
will ever make me feel that way.

788
00:31:40,432 --> 00:31:42,872
I'm so sorry that you're
going through all this.

789
00:31:43,785 --> 00:31:45,318
Today.

790
00:31:47,288 --> 00:31:48,433
I'm here.

791
00:31:48,457 --> 00:31:50,173
Oh, thank God!

792
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:52,420
Acute MR. He might
have a chordal rupture.

793
00:31:52,444 --> 00:31:53,538
We won't know
until we open him up.

794
00:31:53,562 --> 00:31:56,029
I paged you to get
Yang. Yang is his doctor.

795
00:31:56,097 --> 00:31:57,525
Yang's at the wedding. I'm here.

796
00:31:57,549 --> 00:31:59,911
Besides, I treated him. I did a
pericardial window by myself.

797
00:31:59,935 --> 00:32:01,451
I know what I'm doing.

798
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,297
Then find Russell or
page the on-call doctor.

799
00:32:03,321 --> 00:32:06,222
Ruth, clear an OR right now
and prep him for a sternotomy.

800
00:32:06,291 --> 00:32:08,169
Dr. Ross, I don't think so. We
should wait for an attending.

801
00:32:08,193 --> 00:32:09,620
You want to wait? We'll wait.

802
00:32:09,644 --> 00:32:11,522
Then you can explain
to the attending

803
00:32:11,546 --> 00:32:13,474
how this man died because
you wouldn't let me help him.

804
00:32:13,498 --> 00:32:14,798
Is that what you want to do?

805
00:32:17,252 --> 00:32:18,968
Yang forgot.

806
00:32:19,037 --> 00:32:20,382
I knew one of you would forget.

807
00:32:20,406 --> 00:32:21,571
No.

808
00:32:22,541 --> 00:32:23,940
Ah! Thank you!

809
00:32:24,009 --> 00:32:25,275
I knew you'd make it.

810
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:26,421
Okay, so when we get out there,

811
00:32:26,445 --> 00:32:28,022
Arizona's gonna take my bouquet.

812
00:32:28,046 --> 00:32:29,291
So if you and Meredith can
be on either side of my train...

813
00:32:29,315 --> 00:32:30,574
How dare you say
I haven't changed.

814
00:32:30,598 --> 00:32:33,016
I don't have to justify my
choices to you, not one.

815
00:32:33,084 --> 00:32:35,524
How dare you say I am the
same person I was when I got here,

816
00:32:35,554 --> 00:32:38,371
before I knew Burke
and Owen and you.

817
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,956
Your life looks different

818
00:32:40,025 --> 00:32:42,826
because it's filled with
houses and husbands and kids.

819
00:32:42,894 --> 00:32:46,045
And my mine looks
the same, but I'm not.

820
00:32:46,114 --> 00:32:48,398
I've changed. I'm
doing this alone.

821
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:49,666
And that's...

822
00:32:51,136 --> 00:32:54,204
That's just as hard
as what you're doing.

823
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:56,573
But I thought I would
at least have you.

824
00:33:00,579 --> 00:33:03,458
I'm so jealous of you, I
want to set things on fire.

825
00:33:03,482 --> 00:33:05,360
You did what I tried
to do, and I couldn't.

826
00:33:05,384 --> 00:33:07,278
And you don't even
know how you did it.

827
00:33:07,302 --> 00:33:08,780
You have nothing
but time and focus.

828
00:33:08,804 --> 00:33:10,565
You're not who we
were when we got here.

829
00:33:10,589 --> 00:33:13,005
You are who we
both set out to be.

830
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:14,707
And you've become something

831
00:33:15,844 --> 00:33:17,377
we never saw coming.

832
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:25,702
You are as good a mother
as you are a surgeon.

833
00:33:26,455 --> 00:33:29,055
And I'm happy for you.

834
00:33:30,359 --> 00:33:32,620
But we are growing
apart. I know.

835
00:33:32,644 --> 00:33:36,213
And I don't want to
compete with you, but I do,

836
00:33:36,281 --> 00:33:37,558
because we're supposed
to push each other

837
00:33:37,582 --> 00:33:39,477
and make each
other better forever.

838
00:33:39,501 --> 00:33:40,644
Since the day we met, right?

839
00:33:40,668 --> 00:33:41,868
Right.

840
00:33:41,937 --> 00:33:43,220
Okay. So then...

841
00:33:43,288 --> 00:33:44,565
God, I know. I'm
so glad because...

842
00:33:44,589 --> 00:33:46,372
Oh! Shut up!

843
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:48,975
Today is not the day.

844
00:33:49,044 --> 00:33:51,722
You two, super neat that
you're working your crap out,

845
00:33:51,746 --> 00:33:52,795
but not today.

846
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:53,958
And you! You know what?

847
00:33:53,982 --> 00:33:55,860
Stop talking about
adultery on my wedding day,

848
00:33:55,884 --> 00:33:59,552
because it is my wedding day!

849
00:33:59,621 --> 00:34:01,833
I should be feeling
very special right now.

850
00:34:01,857 --> 00:34:04,419
I should be flounced and
fluffed up and checked over

851
00:34:04,443 --> 00:34:06,220
and handed tissues and
told not to cry with joy.

852
00:34:06,244 --> 00:34:07,661
So just... You know what?

853
00:34:07,729 --> 00:34:10,396
Stop thinking about you,
and you make me feel special.

854
00:34:13,452 --> 00:34:15,245
Would you like a tissue?
I'm gonna... You looked good.

855
00:34:15,269 --> 00:34:16,647
You know what? The veil
turned out to be so pretty.

856
00:34:16,671 --> 00:34:17,671
And you...

857
00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:22,353
The pericardium's open!

858
00:34:22,377 --> 00:34:23,788
I cannot believe
we're doing this.

859
00:34:23,812 --> 00:34:25,490
All this blood. Where
is it? Where is it?

860
00:34:25,514 --> 00:34:26,825
Ah. There. Ventricular perf.

861
00:34:26,849 --> 00:34:28,209
Got it. I got my finger on it.

862
00:34:28,233 --> 00:34:30,144
Okay. We put him on bypass,
right? And put a patch on.

863
00:34:30,168 --> 00:34:31,446
No. The perf's widening already.

864
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:33,114
I'll throw a stitch in.
I've seen Yang do it.

865
00:34:33,138 --> 00:34:34,933
2-0 silk. Doctor? Bypass...

866
00:34:34,957 --> 00:34:36,222
I have it! 2-0 silk!

867
00:34:38,427 --> 00:34:40,243
Oh, God. No, no, no.

868
00:34:40,312 --> 00:34:41,822
It's tearing. It's all tearing.

869
00:34:41,846 --> 00:34:43,296
Shane, wait.

870
00:34:43,364 --> 00:34:45,444
I can fix this. I can fix it!

871
00:34:46,451 --> 00:34:47,500
Call for help.

872
00:34:47,569 --> 00:34:49,369
Who? Anyone.

873
00:34:54,075 --> 00:34:55,876
Shane, his heart
wall is disintegrating.

874
00:34:55,944 --> 00:34:57,777
We can just hold
pressure and call for help.

875
00:34:57,846 --> 00:35:00,513
I got it. I got it. I'll do
it. Just shut up! Shut up!

876
00:35:00,582 --> 00:35:03,182
Shane, get back.

877
00:35:03,251 --> 00:35:06,336
Get your hand out of his chest
and get away from the table.

878
00:35:06,405 --> 00:35:08,021
Don't touch her!

879
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:09,372
I got her!

880
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,573
I got her.

881
00:35:15,848 --> 00:35:16,848
Okay, we ready?

882
00:35:16,915 --> 00:35:18,493
Yeah. Okay.

883
00:35:18,517 --> 00:35:19,760
Oh! You made it!

884
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:21,646
I made it. Oh, great! Come here.

885
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:22,670
Chief!

886
00:35:22,738 --> 00:35:24,048
You came! Of course.

887
00:35:24,072 --> 00:35:25,939
The whole hospital's
practically here.

888
00:35:26,008 --> 00:35:27,368
Really? Yeah.

889
00:35:27,392 --> 00:35:28,825
You're very well liked.

890
00:35:30,445 --> 00:35:33,079
Okay, well, now you have to
go, 'cause I'm gonna start crying.

891
00:35:33,147 --> 00:35:35,459
Because if it weren't for you, none
of this would be happening to me.

892
00:35:35,483 --> 00:35:36,983
You deserve it, all of it.

893
00:35:37,052 --> 00:35:39,102
And you look beautiful.

894
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:40,336
Thank you.

895
00:35:40,405 --> 00:35:41,905
Congratulations.

896
00:35:43,909 --> 00:35:45,029
Hey.

897
00:35:45,076 --> 00:35:46,710
And how are the kids?

898
00:35:46,778 --> 00:35:48,689
Zola cried 'cause she couldn't
come with me, but they're fine now.

899
00:35:48,713 --> 00:35:51,280
Oh, she's spoiled from having
you around so much now.

900
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:53,133
You look spectacular. Thank you.

901
00:35:53,201 --> 00:35:54,279
Hey? What?

902
00:35:54,303 --> 00:35:55,580
Um, listen, I just
want to thank you

903
00:35:55,604 --> 00:35:57,136
because this
research is gonna take

904
00:35:57,205 --> 00:35:58,905
so much more
time than I expected.

905
00:35:58,974 --> 00:36:01,002
And I couldn't do it without
the time you're giving me.

906
00:36:01,026 --> 00:36:03,859
And I know you're turning
down a lot of stuff, so thank you.

907
00:36:04,496 --> 00:36:05,862
It's my pleasure.

908
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:13,602
Hey. You made it.

909
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:24,597
Wow. Hi.

910
00:36:24,666 --> 00:36:26,778
We're the only
family we need, right?

911
00:36:26,802 --> 00:36:28,929
And we'll be together
forever, right? You and me.

912
00:36:28,953 --> 00:36:30,731
And if we have
kids, we'll be great.

913
00:36:30,755 --> 00:36:32,022
I'll be a great dad,

914
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:34,468
and you'll be great,
and it'll be just us.

915
00:36:34,492 --> 00:36:36,537
We won't need
anybody else, okay?

916
00:36:36,561 --> 00:36:38,678
Yes. Absolutely.

917
00:36:46,488 --> 00:36:48,968
Dr. Webber, help!
You have to come!

918
00:37:19,304 --> 00:37:20,965
Wow.

919
00:37:36,822 --> 00:37:38,321
Go get re-scrubbed.

920
00:37:39,558 --> 00:37:40,874
Ross?

921
00:37:40,942 --> 00:37:42,182
What do we got here, son?

922
00:37:43,645 --> 00:37:44,844
I did this.

923
00:37:44,913 --> 00:37:47,513
Well, let's just see, okay?

924
00:37:47,582 --> 00:37:49,711
So I hear there's a
tear in the right ventricle.

925
00:37:49,735 --> 00:37:51,001
It's my fault.

926
00:37:51,069 --> 00:37:52,413
All I know is, they
need Webber here

927
00:37:52,437 --> 00:37:53,697
and Shepherd
wants you to get him.

928
00:37:53,721 --> 00:37:55,499
Apparently, he went to
deal with the generator.

929
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:56,763
Well, you did well, son.

930
00:37:56,825 --> 00:37:58,908
We're okay here. I did this.

931
00:37:58,977 --> 00:38:00,888
<i>You didn't do anything.
This is not your fault.</i>

932
00:38:00,912 --> 00:38:02,311
<i>This just happened.</i>

933
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:04,700
I think we need
some bypass, though.

934
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:07,110
Well, what do you think, Ross?

935
00:38:27,004 --> 00:38:29,521
<i>You did good.
We're all done here.</i>

936
00:38:32,844 --> 00:38:33,988
Why don't you go get some rest?

937
00:38:34,012 --> 00:38:35,261
No!

938
00:38:35,329 --> 00:38:37,864
When I come
back, she'll be dead.

939
00:38:37,932 --> 00:38:39,849
It's my fault. I sent
her to the basement.

940
00:38:39,917 --> 00:38:41,250
Ross, look at me.

941
00:38:42,387 --> 00:38:43,653
Look at me.

942
00:38:47,925 --> 00:38:49,075
I got her.

943
00:38:50,445 --> 00:38:51,811
She's gonna be fine.

944
00:38:53,348 --> 00:38:54,697
Go get some rest.

945
00:38:56,335 --> 00:38:58,335
<i>Failure is inevitable.</i>

946
00:39:01,722 --> 00:39:02,972
<i>Unavoidable.</i>

947
00:39:03,041 --> 00:39:05,024
Laps! More laps! Suction.

948
00:39:05,092 --> 00:39:07,237
Murphy, get in here!
Let's get him on bypass.

949
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:08,573
And let's take someone
from cardio now!

950
00:39:08,597 --> 00:39:09,862
On it.

951
00:39:09,931 --> 00:39:11,392
<i>But failure should
never get the last word.</i>

952
00:39:11,416 --> 00:39:14,834
<i>There is no greater
example of God's power</i>

953
00:39:14,903 --> 00:39:17,343
than the love we
share between us.

954
00:39:18,056 --> 00:39:20,068
April and Matthew are here today

955
00:39:20,092 --> 00:39:22,291
to commit that
love to each other

956
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,460
before God and
before all of you.

957
00:39:25,463 --> 00:39:26,946
So let's pray.

958
00:39:30,384 --> 00:39:31,984
Heavenly father,

959
00:39:32,053 --> 00:39:34,971
watch over April and Matthew
as they take the first steps

960
00:39:35,023 --> 00:39:36,617
on a journey that will last them

961
00:39:36,641 --> 00:39:38,102
the rest of their
lives on earth.

962
00:39:38,126 --> 00:39:39,904
Yes, it's Dr. Shepherd.

963
00:39:39,928 --> 00:39:42,006
<i>Sir, we have a call for
you. It seems very urgent.</i>

964
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:43,540
Okay. <i>Hold please.</i>

965
00:39:43,564 --> 00:39:44,875
<i>I'll put it through.</i> Thank you.

966
00:39:44,899 --> 00:39:47,333
<i>You have to hold
on to what you want.</i>

967
00:39:47,401 --> 00:39:49,263
<i>Dr. Derek Shepherd?</i> DEREK: Yes.

968
00:39:49,287 --> 00:39:52,167
<i>Please hold for the
President of the United States.</i>

969
00:39:54,442 --> 00:39:55,775
What?

970
00:39:55,844 --> 00:39:58,410
<i>Please hold for the
President of the United States.</i>

971
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:02,565
And give them the strength to
commit their love to one another.

972
00:40:03,552 --> 00:40:06,402
Unshakable through any storm,

973
00:40:06,471 --> 00:40:08,855
unbreakable in the
face of any stress.

974
00:40:10,508 --> 00:40:14,310
A promise we simply
refuse to break.

975
00:40:15,964 --> 00:40:18,204
<i>You have to not
take no for an answer,</i>

976
00:40:20,334 --> 00:40:22,035
<i>and take what's coming to you.</i>

977
00:40:33,798 --> 00:40:34,964
<i>Never give in.</i>

978
00:40:35,032 --> 00:40:36,365
Starting heart massage.

979
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:38,768
<i>Never give up.</i>

980
00:40:38,837 --> 00:40:40,003
Come on.

981
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:46,142
And you, April and Matthew's
closest friends and family,

982
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:49,028
are here today to bear
witness to their union.

983
00:40:49,097 --> 00:40:53,499
Will you promise to love
and support their marriage

984
00:40:53,568 --> 00:40:55,601
in all the days to come?

985
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:58,988
If so, please
respond, "We will."

986
00:40:59,057 --> 00:41:00,577
We will. We will.

987
00:41:01,392 --> 00:41:02,792
Now...

988
00:41:02,861 --> 00:41:04,438
I, uh... I've known
the two of you...

989
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:06,422
What? For quite some time...

990
00:41:06,581 --> 00:41:07,581
I'm sorry.

991
00:41:07,648 --> 00:41:09,048
<i>Stand up.</i>

992
00:41:09,116 --> 00:41:11,601
And I'm happy to be here
today to be able to do this for you.

993
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:12,685
I...

994
00:41:28,135 --> 00:41:32,154
April and Matthew, I
have known the two of you

995
00:41:32,223 --> 00:41:35,041
for quite some time, and
I'm happy to be here today...

996
00:41:35,110 --> 00:41:36,909
I love you, April.

997
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:39,578
I always have.

998
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:43,249
I love everything about you.

999
00:41:43,318 --> 00:41:44,951
Even the things I don't like,

1000
00:41:46,054 --> 00:41:47,236
I love.

1001
00:41:49,207 --> 00:41:50,539
And I want you with me.

1002
00:41:52,844 --> 00:41:54,960
I love you, and I think

1003
00:41:55,029 --> 00:41:56,629
that you love me, too.

1004
00:42:00,818 --> 00:42:02,151
Do you?

1005
00:42:13,114 --> 00:42:14,794
<i>Stand up and take it.</i>
