1
00:00:11,662 --> 00:00:13,372
<i>When you become an intern,</i>

2
00:00:13,396 --> 00:00:16,514
<i>there's a ceremony where
you get your white coat.</i>

3
00:00:24,508 --> 00:00:25,741
<i>Like magic...</i>

4
00:00:27,578 --> 00:00:30,011
<i>You're a doctor.</i>

5
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,354
<i>My parents came to my
White Coat Ceremony.</i>

6
00:00:39,423 --> 00:00:43,425
<i>I can still picture
them, so happy...</i>

7
00:00:43,494 --> 00:00:45,043
<i>So proud.</i>

8
00:00:45,112 --> 00:00:48,312
Hey, we need to get
the board together, and...

9
00:00:50,016 --> 00:00:51,432
Congratulations.

10
00:00:56,273 --> 00:00:58,084
<i>They say your life
flashes before your eyes</i>

11
00:00:58,108 --> 00:01:00,008
<i>right before you die.</i>

12
00:01:02,913 --> 00:01:04,313
<i>The important moments.</i>

13
00:01:08,285 --> 00:01:11,803
<i>The moments that tested you.</i>

14
00:01:11,871 --> 00:01:13,416
<i>The moments that
made you who you are.</i>

15
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,857
April, you're getting married.

16
00:01:15,925 --> 00:01:17,005
Unless I'm not.

17
00:01:19,213 --> 00:01:20,479
I just heard.

18
00:01:21,781 --> 00:01:22,914
Are you okay?

19
00:01:22,983 --> 00:01:24,048
Yeah.

20
00:01:28,155 --> 00:01:31,590
<i>I don't know about my
life flashing before me.</i>

21
00:01:31,658 --> 00:01:34,226
<i>I was thinking
about my white coat,</i>

22
00:01:34,295 --> 00:01:36,828
<i>and how I'm glad I
have it on me now.</i>

23
00:01:36,897 --> 00:01:38,730
Will you overhead page

24
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,310
- Richard Webber for me?
- Right away.

25
00:01:40,334 --> 00:01:42,517
<i>It's the moment my life started.</i>

26
00:01:48,658 --> 00:01:51,543
<i>Seems fitting it should
be on me when it ends.</i>

27
00:01:54,214 --> 00:01:57,115
<i>Dr. Richard Webber,
please call the ER.</i>

28
00:01:57,184 --> 00:02:00,652
<i>Dr. Richard Webber,
please call the ER.</i>

29
00:02:08,278 --> 00:02:11,212
Baby's sleeping.

30
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:13,893
Okay, we should get started. Oh.

31
00:02:13,917 --> 00:02:16,295
Bailey, we have some board
business that we need to...

32
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:17,786
I'm not going anywhere.

33
00:02:17,855 --> 00:02:20,905
Me and this baby got
Bailey business to discuss.

34
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:24,126
Don't we? Yes,
Mr. Derek Bailey Shepherd.

35
00:02:24,194 --> 00:02:26,060
Yes, we do.

36
00:02:26,129 --> 00:02:27,895
What does Zola think of him?

37
00:02:27,964 --> 00:02:30,465
Oh, she wants to take him
to day care for show and tell.

38
00:02:30,533 --> 00:02:32,411
Where's Richard? I paged
all the board members.

39
00:02:32,435 --> 00:02:33,729
Well, Avery should be here, too.

40
00:02:33,753 --> 00:02:35,598
Yeah, well, he was
being a hero last night.

41
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:37,634
He dislocated his shoulder
saving a kid from the bus crash.

42
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:38,673
What bus crash?

43
00:02:39,693 --> 00:02:41,421
She had a baby. She
doesn't know things.

44
00:02:41,445 --> 00:02:43,145
So tell me.

45
00:02:43,213 --> 00:02:45,091
A church was evacuating some
people, and their bus overturned.

46
00:02:45,115 --> 00:02:46,592
Good news is everyone survived

47
00:02:46,616 --> 00:02:48,061
and there are no major injuries.

48
00:02:48,085 --> 00:02:49,779
And the bad news?
Everything else.

49
00:02:49,803 --> 00:02:53,722
The blood bank is flooded, and
the ER looks like it was ransacked.

50
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:55,223
So we need to close the ER?

51
00:02:55,292 --> 00:02:56,853
We're dangerously low on meds.

52
00:02:56,877 --> 00:02:58,404
Personnel can't make
it in due to the flooding.

53
00:02:58,428 --> 00:02:59,794
So we need to close the ER.

54
00:02:59,863 --> 00:03:01,162
But can we do that?

55
00:03:01,231 --> 00:03:02,614
You are the board.

56
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:04,661
I am telling you that
ER cannot open today.

57
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:06,084
What do we need?

58
00:03:06,153 --> 00:03:08,303
I mean, I can try to
coordinate with our suppliers.

59
00:03:08,371 --> 00:03:10,500
I had a baby. I'm not dead.

60
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:11,968
If they have it,
then we want it.

61
00:03:11,992 --> 00:03:13,503
In the meantime, let's make sure

62
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:14,971
that our inpatients
are taken care of

63
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:17,473
and discharge who
we can. Like me.

64
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:19,257
No, you just had a
major abdominal surgery.

65
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:21,333
You're gonna stay right here.

66
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:22,645
All right, airport's
just reopened.

67
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:23,847
I just put Dr. Boswell in a cab.

68
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:25,270
Who's Dr. Boswell?

69
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:28,890
She's the woman Arizona
slept with last night.

70
00:03:37,084 --> 00:03:38,483
What are you doing?

71
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:39,563
We're closed to
incoming traumas, guys.

72
00:03:39,587 --> 00:03:40,902
Tell that to them.

73
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:42,548
There was a mudslide
near Madrona.

74
00:03:42,572 --> 00:03:44,951
A bunch of cops and firefighters
got hurt doing evacuations.

75
00:03:44,975 --> 00:03:47,086
There are also a bunch of
civilian casualties as well.

76
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:48,443
What about Seattle Pres?

77
00:03:48,512 --> 00:03:49,822
They're worse off than we are.

78
00:03:49,846 --> 00:03:51,908
All right, let's do it.
Help me get this sling off.

79
00:03:51,932 --> 00:03:53,359
Get me every suture
kit, laceration tray,

80
00:03:53,383 --> 00:03:54,903
foley, and chest
tube that you can.

81
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,218
We're gonna come down.

82
00:03:57,287 --> 00:03:58,781
We're sending a triage down.

83
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:00,021
What?

84
00:04:00,089 --> 00:04:02,635
My shift is over. I was gonna
go home and go to sleep.

85
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:04,843
I'm so tired and hungry.

86
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:07,262
My teeth have stuff
growing on them, and...

87
00:04:10,134 --> 00:04:11,444
Can you pretend you
didn't hear any of that?

88
00:04:11,468 --> 00:04:12,567
Yep.

89
00:04:13,436 --> 00:04:14,870
Yeah, yeah.

90
00:04:14,938 --> 00:04:16,978
Coming through. Straight ahead.

91
00:04:20,527 --> 00:04:23,177
Wait, wait. Wait.

92
00:04:23,246 --> 00:04:25,179
Okay, I'm not doing
it in an on-call room.

93
00:04:25,248 --> 00:04:27,448
I'm a grown-up with a house.

94
00:04:27,518 --> 00:04:29,261
Your house has a
tree in the middle of it.

95
00:04:35,726 --> 00:04:36,958
Wait, wait.

96
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:39,267
Did you have sex
with Leah in here?

97
00:04:40,096 --> 00:04:42,564
And Heather?

98
00:04:42,633 --> 00:04:45,633
Oh, God. I don't
think I can do this.

99
00:04:46,804 --> 00:04:48,103
Yeah, I can.

100
00:04:55,012 --> 00:04:58,780
No. No, no, no. I need this.

101
00:04:58,849 --> 00:05:00,560
We're here. We're ready.
Let's just do it. Two minutes.

102
00:05:00,584 --> 00:05:02,028
No one's gonna die
if we don't answer

103
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:03,630
our pagers for
two minutes, right?

104
00:05:03,654 --> 00:05:05,186
Right.

105
00:05:08,191 --> 00:05:09,290
Crap!

106
00:05:09,359 --> 00:05:12,060
Now I'm thinking
about dead people.

107
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:17,032
Lenny Shulte, captain
of ladder company 54.

108
00:05:17,101 --> 00:05:19,717
Unconscious at the
scene with a GCS Of 13.

109
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:22,887
BP's been constantly
dropping. Last was 85 over 60.

110
00:05:22,956 --> 00:05:25,774
I can't get a good breath.

111
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:27,337
Increase his O2 to 10 liters.

112
00:05:27,361 --> 00:05:29,472
Can you tell me if anything
fell on you, on your chest?

113
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:31,429
I don't know.

114
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:35,334
Last thing I remember, helping
the old lady out of her house.

115
00:05:35,402 --> 00:05:37,130
Did she make it? I'll check.

116
00:05:37,154 --> 00:05:42,307
5818 Shore Drive. And my
guys, I got 12 guys out there.

117
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:46,277
Turn him. Turn him!

118
00:05:47,864 --> 00:05:49,725
Okay, looks like
he aspirated mud.

119
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:51,561
Let's get him into
trauma room one.

120
00:05:51,585 --> 00:05:53,546
Let's get a chest X-ray
and start him on antibiotics.

121
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:55,770
Let's go!

122
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,639
Go! Coming through.

123
00:06:02,128 --> 00:06:05,147
Owen and I...

124
00:06:05,215 --> 00:06:08,150
I don't even know
what to call it.

125
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:12,987
Ended it? Broke up?

126
00:06:13,923 --> 00:06:15,990
I feel like I'm gonna die.

127
00:06:16,059 --> 00:06:19,027
You always end it, and
then you start it again.

128
00:06:19,096 --> 00:06:21,012
Yeah, but this is different.

129
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:24,181
Okay.

130
00:06:24,251 --> 00:06:26,718
I'm gonna go to sleep.

131
00:06:26,787 --> 00:06:28,854
Just for, like, 20 minutes.

132
00:06:28,922 --> 00:06:30,605
Okay.

133
00:06:30,674 --> 00:06:32,924
Oh, Robbins cheating on Callie?

134
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:35,009
Oh! Did not see that coming.

135
00:06:35,078 --> 00:06:37,044
I know.

136
00:06:37,113 --> 00:06:38,379
And Bailey is a good name.

137
00:06:38,448 --> 00:06:41,433
But two Baileys? You don't
think it's gonna be confusing?

138
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:44,936
No, because if I say,
"Bailey peed on me,"

139
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:47,922
I think it's safe to assume
that I'm talking about my son.

140
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:50,658
Very good. Seriously,
wake me in 20?

141
00:06:50,727 --> 00:06:52,794
Okay. Thank you.

142
00:06:59,803 --> 00:07:01,969
I feel like I'm gonna die.

143
00:07:02,038 --> 00:07:04,133
<i>Dr. Bentley to
ICU on four north.</i>

144
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:05,990
Shepherd?

145
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:07,770
Yeah, Lydia Ashford. Injuries
to the upper extremities.

146
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:08,943
My house.

147
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:10,156
And she's worried
about her house.

148
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,679
Wait. 5818 Shore Drive?

149
00:07:11,748 --> 00:07:14,249
Yes. Is it gone? I don't know.

150
00:07:14,317 --> 00:07:16,117
Karev, Kepner's in trauma one.

151
00:07:16,152 --> 00:07:18,569
Get her to tell her patient
5818 Shore Drive made it.

152
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:20,305
Kepner!

153
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:22,040
Tell your guy 5818 is out.

154
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:23,724
I could've done that.

155
00:07:23,811 --> 00:07:25,838
I'm sorry, but I need a
neuro consult in bay seven.

156
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:26,989
The guy's unconscious,
but he's stable.

157
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:29,247
Okay.

158
00:07:29,316 --> 00:07:30,794
Look what I found
in outpatient surgery.

159
00:07:30,818 --> 00:07:32,728
Ross, stay here. I paged Brooks.

160
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:34,897
Have her get Mrs. Ashford
a pan scan of the head,

161
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:36,237
neck, chest, and abdomen.

162
00:07:36,306 --> 00:07:37,705
Well, I can take her.

163
00:07:37,774 --> 00:07:39,124
No, have Brooks do it.

164
00:07:40,677 --> 00:07:42,104
Uh, the mayor's on the phone.

165
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,906
He wants to know about
casualties from the mudslide.

166
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:45,207
I told him it was soon to tell,

167
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:46,425
but he wants to
hear it from you.

168
00:07:46,449 --> 00:07:47,648
Okay.

169
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:56,474
Hey, go find Dr. Webber.

170
00:07:56,543 --> 00:07:58,571
I'm supposed to give Dr. Brooks
a message from Dr. Shepherd.

171
00:07:58,595 --> 00:07:59,706
Is that life-threatening?

172
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:02,363
Because not having
enough general surgeons

173
00:08:02,432 --> 00:08:05,832
in here right now is
life-threatening. Go find Webber.

174
00:08:14,611 --> 00:08:16,127
Have you seen Dr. Webber?

175
00:08:16,196 --> 00:08:17,573
Last time I saw him
was after surgery.

176
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:18,908
He went to go check
on the generator.

177
00:08:18,932 --> 00:08:21,500
Where's that? How
the hell should I know?

178
00:08:23,637 --> 00:08:25,403
Lidocaine and a bunch of 4x4s.

179
00:08:25,455 --> 00:08:27,033
Can you take that to Hunt?
I got paged by Shepherd.

180
00:08:27,057 --> 00:08:29,457
Uh, he wants you
to go find Webber.

181
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:32,644
Are you sure? He
just paged me 9-1-2.

182
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:34,390
That's our special little code.

183
00:08:34,414 --> 00:08:36,458
It means more emergent
than 9-1-1. Get it?

184
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:38,049
All I know is they
need Webber here

185
00:08:38,117 --> 00:08:39,651
and Shepherd
wants you to get him.

186
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:41,719
Apparently, he went to
deal with the generator.

187
00:08:54,851 --> 00:08:58,152
And I'm walking toward the car
and suddenly the hillside just goes...

188
00:08:58,221 --> 00:08:59,687
And I'm falling.

189
00:08:59,773 --> 00:09:01,573
I see my squad car
coming down on top of me,

190
00:09:01,608 --> 00:09:03,675
so I managed to
roll out of the way,

191
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,777
but my leg was caught under it.

192
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:09,447
Can you salvage it?

193
00:09:09,516 --> 00:09:11,549
I think so. We'll
get ortho down here.

194
00:09:11,618 --> 00:09:13,545
I'm gonna take a look at that
nasty laceration on your neck though.

195
00:09:13,569 --> 00:09:15,689
It's a lot of embedded debris.

196
00:09:16,957 --> 00:09:21,058
Hey, Tilden? Everyone
make it out of the mud?

197
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:25,129
Everyone's accounted for except
Lauenstein, Phil G, and Brian.

198
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:29,383
Brian's my fiance.

199
00:09:29,452 --> 00:09:31,614
Don't worry. You know
him. He's gonna be fine.

200
00:09:31,638 --> 00:09:34,372
Look, he's probably
giving himself a mud facial.

201
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,985
You know, look
good for the wedding.

202
00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:38,877
Yeah, well, if he had cold
feet, he should've just said so.

203
00:09:42,532 --> 00:09:43,815
Okay.

204
00:09:48,455 --> 00:09:50,021
Dr. Webber?

205
00:09:53,493 --> 00:09:55,126
Dr. Webber!

206
00:09:58,515 --> 00:09:59,864
Oh, crap. Dr. Webber!

207
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:27,470
Oscar Hallis. Shepherd
says he's probably concussed.

208
00:10:27,494 --> 00:10:28,671
We're gonna do a head CT.

209
00:10:28,695 --> 00:10:30,144
I'm more concerned
about infection.

210
00:10:30,213 --> 00:10:31,690
That is a nasty cut on his leg.

211
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:33,759
Well, Dr. Wilson's
irrigating it with saline.

212
00:10:33,783 --> 00:10:35,127
But we couldn't
find any bacitracin.

213
00:10:35,151 --> 00:10:36,479
We're gonna hang
some ampicillin.

214
00:10:36,503 --> 00:10:38,219
No ampicillin!

215
00:10:38,288 --> 00:10:40,349
He's allergic to penicillin.
How do you know?

216
00:10:42,542 --> 00:10:43,924
What the hell?

217
00:10:45,128 --> 00:10:46,728
Military trick.

218
00:10:46,796 --> 00:10:49,931
Someone triaged him at the
scene, probably whoever dug him out.

219
00:10:49,999 --> 00:10:52,917
Substitute cefazolin and keep
a close eye for allergic reaction.

220
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:54,814
All right. Get some cefazolin.

221
00:10:54,838 --> 00:10:56,582
We don't have it. Well, find it.

222
00:10:56,606 --> 00:10:58,472
People, check your
patients for vitals

223
00:10:58,541 --> 00:11:00,357
written in Sharpie
on their bodies.

224
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:02,593
Someone at the scene
knew what they were doing.

225
00:11:04,513 --> 00:11:05,993
Might've just
saved this guy's life.

226
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:10,718
Sharpie here, too.

227
00:11:10,787 --> 00:11:12,704
And it indicates he's
getting worse fast.

228
00:11:12,756 --> 00:11:14,333
His BP was better
in the field. Crap.

229
00:11:14,357 --> 00:11:15,917
Okay, we need to
stabilize his pelvis.

230
00:11:17,994 --> 00:11:19,761
Okay, you're gonna
need to pull harder.

231
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:21,362
Talk to me, Murphy.

232
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:23,931
Aaron Garcia. CT showed
an open book pelvic fracture

233
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,894
on a liver lac with
hemorrhage. Harder, Murphy.

234
00:11:25,918 --> 00:11:27,697
I'm afraid if I pull too hard,
I'm gonna make it worse.

235
00:11:27,721 --> 00:11:29,264
You can't... Move.
Can't make it worse.

236
00:11:29,288 --> 00:11:31,583
It's already as
bad as it can be.

237
00:11:32,909 --> 00:11:34,336
All right, I need to
get this guy upstairs

238
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,955
and put on an ex
fix immediately.

239
00:11:35,979 --> 00:11:38,462
Murphy, book an OR.
And ask Bailey to scrub in.

240
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:39,831
What do you need Bailey for?

241
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,327
He has a liver lac. I
need a general surgeon.

242
00:11:41,351 --> 00:11:43,128
Well, I'm a general surgeon,
and it's all hands on deck.

243
00:11:43,152 --> 00:11:44,235
Get me Bailey!

244
00:11:47,056 --> 00:11:49,657
<i>Dr. Mahoney to the
ER. Dr. Mahoney...</i>

245
00:11:49,725 --> 00:11:50,902
Do you have cefazolin?

246
00:11:50,926 --> 00:11:52,037
Yeah, they were
hoarding it in OB.

247
00:11:52,061 --> 00:11:53,272
Bastards. Give me some.

248
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:55,736
Ha! I'll trade you
for a chest tube.

249
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:56,865
And a granola bar.

250
00:11:56,933 --> 00:11:58,227
I don't have a
granola bar. Liar.

251
00:11:58,251 --> 00:12:00,684
You've got granola-bar
breath. Do you want the cef?

252
00:12:00,754 --> 00:12:02,220
Fine! Yeah.

253
00:12:02,289 --> 00:12:03,455
What is going on out there?

254
00:12:03,523 --> 00:12:04,638
Huge mudslide. Gotta go.

255
00:12:04,707 --> 00:12:07,458
Lot of crush injuries.
Super cute baby.

256
00:12:07,527 --> 00:12:09,861
I thought the ER was closed!

257
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:11,061
Where's Brooks?

258
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:13,175
She was busy, so I went
ahead and did the scan.

259
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:15,277
It shows a small
subarachnoid hemorrhage.

260
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:16,979
Her exam? Neuro
checks have been stable.

261
00:12:17,003 --> 00:12:18,647
All right, tell Brooks I
want her to continue on

262
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:20,048
with Q 1 hour
neuro checks. But...

263
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:21,817
Don't argue with me.
Just find Brooks. Yes, sir.

264
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:23,241
Mrs. Ashford, how
are you feeling?

265
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:28,295
My house. 5818.

266
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:30,631
Crown molding in every room.

267
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,851
All right, right now
I'm worried about you.

268
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:34,285
Your fingers are crushed.

269
00:12:34,354 --> 00:12:36,687
I need an ortho consult, please.
- On it.

270
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,301
Okay, I need you to
look up here for me.

271
00:12:38,325 --> 00:12:39,890
Crown molding in every room.

272
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:41,409
Okay.

273
00:12:42,745 --> 00:12:43,777
Okay.

274
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:45,446
How's he doing?

275
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:47,159
Captain Shulte has decreased
breath sounds on the right,

276
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:49,462
worsening tachypnea and
persistent sats in the 80s.

277
00:12:49,486 --> 00:12:51,280
Took me forever
to find a chest tube.

278
00:12:51,304 --> 00:12:55,423
I need a list.
Who's still missing?

279
00:12:55,492 --> 00:12:57,403
Okay, Lenny, something
in your chest cavity's

280
00:12:57,427 --> 00:12:58,787
preventing you
from breathing well,

281
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:00,138
so we're gonna
insert a chest tube

282
00:13:00,162 --> 00:13:01,356
which should help
you breathe better.

283
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,247
Is there anyone that
we can call for you?

284
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:05,850
Call Marla,

285
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:09,064
but don't let her come
up here. Road's not safe.

286
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:10,716
Guys, you're gonna
need to go. All right.

287
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,451
Okay. Come on.
Hang in there, Lenny.

288
00:13:12,475 --> 00:13:14,336
Okay, you're gonna feel
a little snip. Here you go.

289
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,971
Got a chest tube. APRIL:
Too late. Already got one.

290
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:17,929
Okay, let me help.

291
00:13:17,998 --> 00:13:19,280
Okay.

292
00:13:28,358 --> 00:13:30,057
Oh, God! Oh, God, it's poop!

293
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:33,595
Oh, jeez. I'm sorry, sweetheart.

294
00:13:33,663 --> 00:13:34,973
The tube is in a good position.

295
00:13:34,997 --> 00:13:36,625
I suspect a
diaphragmatic rupture.

296
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:39,967
Lenny, I believe your colon has
been pushed up into your chest.

297
00:13:40,036 --> 00:13:42,420
Now the risk of infection
is extremely high.

298
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:45,306
Now if I'm right, we're gonna
need to open you up. All right?

299
00:13:45,374 --> 00:13:47,152
Give me the chart,
please. Here you go, Doctor.

300
00:13:47,176 --> 00:13:49,561
All right, let's get an X-ray
and prep him for surgery.

301
00:13:49,629 --> 00:13:51,307
I'll scrub in with
you. Call Bailey.

302
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:52,697
Ask her to man the ER, please.

303
00:13:54,367 --> 00:13:55,916
Go.

304
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:00,883
<i>Dr. Trask to OR two.</i>

305
00:14:00,907 --> 00:14:02,807
<i>Dr. Trask to OR two.</i>

306
00:14:04,444 --> 00:14:05,910
Dr. Bailey.

307
00:14:05,979 --> 00:14:07,778
You smell like feces.

308
00:14:07,848 --> 00:14:09,130
I know.

309
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:12,300
So why you standing next
to me if you smell like feces?

310
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:15,514
Dr. Hunt would
like you to take over

311
00:14:15,538 --> 00:14:17,015
in the ER while he
goes up to surgery.

312
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:19,707
Tell Dr. Hunt I'm about
to go in with Torres

313
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:21,487
on this gentleman's
broken pelvis,

314
00:14:21,511 --> 00:14:22,810
so I can't man the ER.

315
00:14:22,878 --> 00:14:23,911
Where's Dr. Webber?

316
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,396
I don't know.

317
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:28,283
Okay, well, find him.

318
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:32,103
Someone needs to
find Richard Webber!

319
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,219
Coming through!

320
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,073
Webber's pulse is thready.

321
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:56,377
Systolic's 80. Brooks
has massive head trauma.

322
00:14:56,445 --> 00:14:57,795
Pupils are unresponsive.

323
00:15:01,167 --> 00:15:03,117
Let's get her on
her side. Ready?

324
00:15:03,185 --> 00:15:05,085
Move over here.
One, two, three, go.

325
00:15:05,155 --> 00:15:06,721
Get her for a CT, Ross?

326
00:15:07,774 --> 00:15:09,473
Ross! Let's go. Go!

327
00:15:11,127 --> 00:15:14,194
V-tach. Give me one of
epi. Come on. Come on.

328
00:15:15,297 --> 00:15:17,297
Charge to 120. MAN: Got it.

329
00:15:17,434 --> 00:15:19,250
Clear.

330
00:15:22,555 --> 00:15:23,955
Okay, charge to 200. Clear.

331
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:31,211
Charge to 200. Clear.

332
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,109
I know you guys are freaked out,

333
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:36,067
but we have patients,
so you need to focus.

334
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:38,052
Figure out who Ross
and Brooks were covering.

335
00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:39,998
Uh, Ross was doing neuro
checks on crown molding.

336
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:42,051
No breath sounds. So
I can take over those.

337
00:15:42,075 --> 00:15:44,459
Allergic guy is awake, and
his head CT came back clear.

338
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:47,011
Last time I checked his
BP, it was good, like...

339
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:50,297
Like 115 over 70. I
wrote it down somewhere.

340
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:51,932
What the hell?

341
00:15:52,001 --> 00:15:53,546
Well, the electronic charts
are still down, so I'm winging it.

342
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:55,331
Let's charge him again.
Crap. I know I have it.

343
00:15:55,355 --> 00:15:56,637
Clear!

344
00:15:59,592 --> 00:16:00,832
Give him another epi.

345
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:04,962
Come on.

346
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:11,686
Oscar, I'm Dr. Karev.
Glad you're awake.

347
00:16:11,754 --> 00:16:14,872
Your head CT is clear, and we're
gonna have plastics sew up your leg.

348
00:16:14,924 --> 00:16:16,056
Awesome.

349
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:18,475
All right. BP looks
good. 115 over 85.

350
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:20,294
Our electronic charts are down.

351
00:16:20,363 --> 00:16:22,096
Hope you don't mind
a temporary tattoo.

352
00:16:22,164 --> 00:16:24,284
Go for it, doc. I
already got one.

353
00:16:33,526 --> 00:16:34,569
I'm gonna scrub in.

354
00:16:34,593 --> 00:16:35,826
They wanna take me back.

355
00:16:41,317 --> 00:16:43,095
Look, I know Heather's a friend,

356
00:16:43,119 --> 00:16:44,863
and if you need
more time, I can...

357
00:16:44,887 --> 00:16:46,654
No. I'm...

358
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:49,390
I'm fine.

359
00:16:49,459 --> 00:16:51,458
Good. Go help prep the patient.

360
00:16:58,885 --> 00:17:01,952
I know that you wanted Bailey
but she's working on Richard.

361
00:17:05,091 --> 00:17:06,701
Callie, we should...
Should what?

362
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:08,854
Not sleep with other people?
Respect our wedding vows?

363
00:17:08,878 --> 00:17:10,711
We should put our
problems aside right now

364
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:13,099
because this guy deserves that.

365
00:17:23,659 --> 00:17:26,828
Well, thank God you
found them, Ross.

366
00:17:26,896 --> 00:17:30,564
Let's just hope you
found them in time.

367
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:32,666
Damn it. Subdural.

368
00:17:34,453 --> 00:17:36,254
Oh, God.

369
00:17:37,757 --> 00:17:39,423
Let's go.

370
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:45,630
Line's in. Swan, please.

371
00:17:45,698 --> 00:17:47,698
Okay, let's hook him back up.

372
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:50,551
Labs.

373
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:51,813
Okay, troponin?

374
00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:52,903
Elevated at four.

375
00:17:52,972 --> 00:17:54,955
Crit? Fine at 40.

376
00:17:55,024 --> 00:17:58,008
Potassium's 4.5. Bicarb
18. Everything else is normal.

377
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:01,329
Lactate. Two.

378
00:18:01,397 --> 00:18:03,880
No, that can't be right.
He should be acidotic.

379
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:05,761
His girth is increasing
as we stand here.

380
00:18:05,785 --> 00:18:08,146
Look, it says... I know
what it says, but it's wrong.

381
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:09,410
Redo it.

382
00:18:15,562 --> 00:18:17,711
All right, charge again to 200.

383
00:18:19,215 --> 00:18:20,681
<i>Clear.</i>

384
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,933
Karev? What's going
on with Richard?

385
00:18:23,002 --> 00:18:25,853
Echo shows very little heart
activity, and CVP's elevated.

386
00:18:25,922 --> 00:18:28,155
Yang's about to set
up for a balloon pump.

387
00:18:28,224 --> 00:18:30,268
All right, if we're sending
him up to surgery,

388
00:18:30,292 --> 00:18:31,636
let's make sure we have an
adequate blood supply for transfusion.

389
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:33,127
On it.

390
00:18:33,196 --> 00:18:34,773
If you need to go deal with
more dire patients, I get it.

391
00:18:34,797 --> 00:18:36,213
Go. I'm fine.

392
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:38,360
Actually, you're not, Sasha.

393
00:18:38,384 --> 00:18:39,962
It's important that we go ahead
and debride and clean out this wound

394
00:18:39,986 --> 00:18:42,887
as soon as possible
to prevent infection.

395
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:44,338
Sasha...

396
00:18:44,406 --> 00:18:45,483
Are you supposed to be
walking around on that thing?

397
00:18:45,507 --> 00:18:47,191
I can't sit still.

398
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:48,141
I'm waiting on plastic
surgery to sew me up.

399
00:18:48,211 --> 00:18:50,143
That's this guy.

400
00:18:50,213 --> 00:18:52,045
You mind if I sit here?

401
00:18:58,571 --> 00:19:00,704
That kind of looks
like Brian's handwriting.

402
00:19:00,773 --> 00:19:03,351
Yeah, I know. My glasses
got knocked off in the slide.

403
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:05,926
I could barely see a
thing, but it could've been.

404
00:19:05,994 --> 00:19:07,995
But was it his voice?

405
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:10,042
I can't remember.
I'm sorry, Sash.

406
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:12,143
I was kind of out
of it, you know?

407
00:19:12,167 --> 00:19:13,245
I'm sorry.

408
00:19:13,269 --> 00:19:15,385
Just a little discoloration
in the tissue.

409
00:19:15,454 --> 00:19:18,750
I'd like to run a few tests just to make
sure there's nothing to worry about.

410
00:19:18,774 --> 00:19:21,375
I'm just gonna
numb you up, okay?

411
00:19:22,345 --> 00:19:23,727
Yeah, go ahead.

412
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:27,615
I'm telling you,
that's his writing.

413
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,083
We need blood, Mer.

414
00:19:29,152 --> 00:19:30,396
There's no time to screen,
type, or cross. All right?

415
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:31,786
I need all the O-neg I can get.

416
00:19:31,854 --> 00:19:33,348
Okay, but wait. Tell
me what's going on?

417
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:34,950
And staff, lab
techs, scrub nurses.

418
00:19:34,974 --> 00:19:36,894
I need ETAs on when
you can get people in here.

419
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:38,058
Page me when you can.

420
00:19:38,127 --> 00:19:39,426
Alex, pick up the baby.

421
00:19:39,495 --> 00:19:40,727
Mer, I don't have time.

422
00:19:40,797 --> 00:19:43,630
Alex. Pick up my baby.

423
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:59,613
No, the baby is for you, so
that you can stop freaking out.

424
00:19:59,682 --> 00:20:03,122
Now just relax and
tell me what's going on.

425
00:20:06,321 --> 00:20:09,790
Webber and Brooks are
down. They were electrocuted.

426
00:20:09,858 --> 00:20:12,209
It's bad, but we're
dealing with it.

427
00:20:12,278 --> 00:20:13,810
I just need you to
get on the phone

428
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,373
and help us get
those supplies, okay?

429
00:20:15,397 --> 00:20:17,431
Okay. Okay.

430
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,766
Here.

431
00:20:18,835 --> 00:20:20,784
Your turn not to freak out.

432
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,972
Okay, forceps. Metz.

433
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:27,919
I have a status update
on Dr. Webber. Okay.

434
00:20:27,943 --> 00:20:31,207
Dr. Yang is attempting to place a
balloon pump, but he keeps coding.

435
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:34,131
She's placing one
bedside without fluoro?

436
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,866
She could rupture his aorta.

437
00:20:35,934 --> 00:20:37,513
Do you want me to get
Dr. Yang on the phone?

438
00:20:37,537 --> 00:20:38,914
You just said that she's
threading a balloon pump.

439
00:20:38,938 --> 00:20:40,849
She is, but... How is she
gonna talk on the phone?

440
00:20:40,873 --> 00:20:42,468
I didn't mean... Retract her.

441
00:20:42,492 --> 00:20:44,124
No. No, no, no.

442
00:20:44,193 --> 00:20:45,759
Okay, let's run the bowel.

443
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:48,173
The abdomen's fully
contaminated. Just run the bowel.

444
00:20:48,197 --> 00:20:49,708
We're gonna resect
this and get out of here.

445
00:20:49,732 --> 00:20:52,116
Let's get ready to pack him.

446
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:53,734
Come on, Lenny.

447
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:03,393
It's too quiet. Talk.

448
00:21:07,866 --> 00:21:10,267
You're doing good.

449
00:21:10,336 --> 00:21:14,488
You are not going
to rupture the aorta

450
00:21:14,557 --> 00:21:18,275
because you are Cristina Yang.

451
00:21:18,344 --> 00:21:20,478
Attach this to the console.

452
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:23,490
You are the star of your class.

453
00:21:24,133 --> 00:21:28,735
I always knew it. I said
it to anyone who'd ask.

454
00:21:28,821 --> 00:21:33,390
"Look out for Cristina
Yang." I said it to Webber.

455
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:35,776
"Cristina Yang is good.

456
00:21:35,845 --> 00:21:39,763
"Cristina Yang would
not rupture an aorta.

457
00:21:39,832 --> 00:21:41,231
"Cristina..."

458
00:21:45,538 --> 00:21:47,221
Oh, God, you did it.

459
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:54,728
Oh, dear Lord. He
has a steady heartbeat.

460
00:21:54,797 --> 00:21:57,364
Praise Jesus. You
didn't rupture his aorta.

461
00:21:57,433 --> 00:22:00,301
Secure this device and
get him up to the ICU.

462
00:22:00,386 --> 00:22:02,036
We just bought him some time.

463
00:22:06,008 --> 00:22:08,192
Hug me back, Cristina Yang.

464
00:22:08,244 --> 00:22:09,910
I know you are not a hugger,

465
00:22:09,979 --> 00:22:13,130
but right now I need
you to hug me back.

466
00:22:26,312 --> 00:22:27,344
Hey, Mrs. Ashford.

467
00:22:27,413 --> 00:22:28,679
Did you find out?

468
00:22:28,747 --> 00:22:30,725
Press against my hands
with the bottoms of your feet.

469
00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:32,899
Find out what? About my house.

470
00:22:32,968 --> 00:22:34,946
It has the most
beautiful crown moldings.

471
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:36,403
Now with your hands.

472
00:22:36,472 --> 00:22:38,805
I'm sorry. I haven't had
time to ask about your house.

473
00:22:38,874 --> 00:22:41,024
How's your vision?
Any blurriness?

474
00:22:41,093 --> 00:22:45,129
My vision? I don't
care about my... Stop.

475
00:22:45,181 --> 00:22:47,114
Stop this nonsense.

476
00:22:47,183 --> 00:22:50,033
Just call somebody, please.
Find out about my house.

477
00:22:50,102 --> 00:22:52,064
Ma'am, this isn't nonsense.
I'm trying to help you,

478
00:22:52,088 --> 00:22:53,720
and I have about
20 other patients,

479
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:55,717
so checking on your house is
the last thing on my mind right now.

480
00:22:55,741 --> 00:22:57,174
People got injured badly,

481
00:22:57,243 --> 00:22:59,643
so you need to stop
worrying about your house,

482
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:03,714
and you need to tell me if you are
experiencing any blurriness of vision.

483
00:23:09,021 --> 00:23:10,387
His lactate is six.

484
00:23:10,456 --> 00:23:11,789
Six?

485
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:25,069
He has an acute abdomen.
Get me an OR, and a good staff.

486
00:23:25,138 --> 00:23:26,831
I'll take Linda, if she's
available. Norman.

487
00:23:26,855 --> 00:23:28,015
Are you out of your mind?

488
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,500
Norman's MIA. Okay, Anna, then.

489
00:23:29,524 --> 00:23:31,358
I'll make some phone calls.

490
00:23:31,426 --> 00:23:33,310
You're not opening him up.

491
00:23:33,379 --> 00:23:37,515
The electrical injury may have
caused intra-abdominal tissue damage

492
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:39,950
and likely progressing
because of his heart failing.

493
00:23:40,019 --> 00:23:41,735
He barely tolerated
the balloon pump.

494
00:23:41,804 --> 00:23:43,499
I need to get in there and
debride the dead tissue.

495
00:23:43,523 --> 00:23:45,550
There's no way his heart
can handle the anesthesia.

496
00:23:45,574 --> 00:23:46,907
His lactate is six.

497
00:23:46,976 --> 00:23:48,256
He needs sustained cardiac ICU.

498
00:23:48,327 --> 00:23:50,472
He's gonna die if
we don't do anything.

499
00:23:50,496 --> 00:23:52,513
We're not doing nothing.

500
00:23:52,581 --> 00:23:54,347
We're gonna let the
balloon pump work.

501
00:23:54,416 --> 00:23:56,327
I am the attending...
And keep his fluids tight.

502
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:59,937
You are a fellow. I
make the decisions here.

503
00:24:00,005 --> 00:24:01,922
Well, I own this
hospital. You work for me.

504
00:24:04,426 --> 00:24:05,821
He's bleeding
through the packing,

505
00:24:05,845 --> 00:24:07,388
and there's still
stool coming out.

506
00:24:07,412 --> 00:24:09,812
Damn it. We need to take it
out and resect more intestines.

507
00:24:09,848 --> 00:24:12,127
How's his INR?
The last one was six.

508
00:24:12,151 --> 00:24:14,785
Okay, give him factor
VII, FFPs and platelets.

509
00:24:14,854 --> 00:24:16,014
Faster, Kepner.

510
00:24:16,038 --> 00:24:17,420
He's having arrhythmias.

511
00:24:17,489 --> 00:24:19,490
Talk to me. Uh, I
can't get a pulse.

512
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:20,975
I think he's in PEA.

513
00:24:21,043 --> 00:24:22,409
Starting compressions.

514
00:24:25,264 --> 00:24:27,576
I know this is difficult,
but Brooks is our patient.

515
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,678
I'm telling you this to
remind you to be her doctor,

516
00:24:29,702 --> 00:24:31,885
not her friend right now.

517
00:24:31,954 --> 00:24:34,254
There are decisions
to be made in there

518
00:24:34,323 --> 00:24:36,957
that will affect not only
her ability to be a surgeon,

519
00:24:37,026 --> 00:24:40,493
her speech, her ability
to function, her life.

520
00:24:40,563 --> 00:24:42,379
But those decisions
are ultimately mine.

521
00:24:42,447 --> 00:24:44,648
I will not make them lightly.

522
00:24:44,717 --> 00:24:46,666
But I will make them quickly,

523
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:49,252
and you need to do exactly
as I say. No questions.

524
00:24:49,322 --> 00:24:50,754
Can you do that?

525
00:24:50,823 --> 00:24:52,205
I think so.

526
00:24:52,275 --> 00:24:53,807
That's not good enough.

527
00:24:55,077 --> 00:24:57,344
Yes, sir. I can do it, sir.

528
00:25:07,306 --> 00:25:10,907
I'll take this to the labs, and
Dr. Avery will let you know the results.

529
00:25:10,976 --> 00:25:12,409
Thank you.

530
00:25:13,712 --> 00:25:16,112
Hey. Heard you were
looking for this guy.

531
00:25:17,049 --> 00:25:19,199
Brian! I was so worried.

532
00:25:19,268 --> 00:25:20,729
Get over here and
give me a kiss, you jerk.

533
00:25:20,753 --> 00:25:22,614
Baby, I'm all
muddy. I don't care.

534
00:25:22,638 --> 00:25:23,737
Are you okay?

535
00:25:27,576 --> 00:25:30,005
I knew that was your handwriting.
What are you talking about?

536
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:31,762
On Oscar.

537
00:25:32,899 --> 00:25:34,647
Didn't you pull him out? No.

538
00:25:34,716 --> 00:25:36,578
Someone triaged a
bunch of guys at the scene

539
00:25:36,602 --> 00:25:38,046
and wrote vitals
down with a Sharpie.

540
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:39,536
Yeah, I wish that was me.

541
00:25:39,605 --> 00:25:42,172
I was just sitting in an air
pocket, twiddling my thumbs.

542
00:25:42,241 --> 00:25:44,068
I actually think I'm having
some trouble moving.

543
00:25:44,092 --> 00:25:45,259
I think I broke some ribs.

544
00:25:45,327 --> 00:25:46,743
Let's get those checked out.

545
00:25:46,812 --> 00:25:48,144
Yeah.

546
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:52,049
I heard Lenny was in
surgery. How's he doing?

547
00:25:52,117 --> 00:25:53,483
I don't know.

548
00:25:53,535 --> 00:25:55,735
PH is down to 7.12.

549
00:25:56,188 --> 00:25:58,305
Come on, Lenny.

550
00:25:58,374 --> 00:25:59,673
He's been down 20 minutes.

551
00:26:04,063 --> 00:26:05,303
Did you say yes?

552
00:26:06,248 --> 00:26:08,265
Sir? To Matthew.

553
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:10,233
I helped with his proposal.

554
00:26:11,554 --> 00:26:12,864
Oh.

555
00:26:12,888 --> 00:26:15,021
Yeah. Yes. I said yes.

556
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:16,757
Good.

557
00:26:16,826 --> 00:26:19,107
I like him. He's a good guy.

558
00:26:19,812 --> 00:26:22,145
I mean, these guys...

559
00:26:22,214 --> 00:26:25,299
These first responders,
they're all good guys.

560
00:26:25,368 --> 00:26:26,817
Hate to give up.

561
00:26:35,194 --> 00:26:36,726
Damn it, Lenny.

562
00:26:45,487 --> 00:26:48,371
Time of death, 15:56.

563
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,691
It's Dr. Karev. The firefighters
are asking for an update.

564
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:13,079
Chaplain's on his way
to tell Marla and the girls.

565
00:27:14,667 --> 00:27:17,501
She's gonna wanna
come in and see him.

566
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:20,403
Absolutely.

567
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:22,792
Let's bring her in.
Full lights and sirens.

568
00:27:23,458 --> 00:27:25,042
On it.

569
00:27:25,094 --> 00:27:27,778
Lauenstein's still missing.

570
00:27:27,847 --> 00:27:31,047
We gotta bring him back.
We gotta do that for Lenny.

571
00:27:33,085 --> 00:27:34,768
If I could walk, I'd
be out on that pile.

572
00:27:37,339 --> 00:27:39,173
Excuse me.

573
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,384
Kelly clamp. Suction.

574
00:27:50,453 --> 00:27:52,330
Guys, he's almost lost
his entire blood volume.

575
00:27:52,354 --> 00:27:54,165
If you don't get control up
there... It's already done.

576
00:27:54,189 --> 00:27:55,533
I controlled the bleeding
using a pringle maneuver.

577
00:27:55,557 --> 00:27:57,307
Wow. Cool.

578
00:27:57,376 --> 00:27:59,354
Don't be so impressed.
It's fairly standard.

579
00:27:59,378 --> 00:28:01,411
Yeah, I know, but
you did it so well.

580
00:28:06,352 --> 00:28:07,917
I was wrong before, Murphy,

581
00:28:07,986 --> 00:28:11,772
when I implied that Dr. Robbins
wasn't a real general surgeon.

582
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:15,275
She is. She's an
excellent general surgeon.

583
00:28:15,344 --> 00:28:19,012
It's okay. We've all said
things that we shouldn't have.

584
00:28:26,088 --> 00:28:27,404
Oh, Owen.

585
00:28:27,473 --> 00:28:29,823
Oh, no. You're not
gonna "Owen" this.

586
00:28:29,892 --> 00:28:32,804
No personal relationships. This
is professional. This is Dr. Hunt.

587
00:28:32,828 --> 00:28:34,394
What is going on?

588
00:28:34,463 --> 00:28:37,125
Dr. Webber has an acute
abdomen. He needs surgery.

589
00:28:37,149 --> 00:28:38,493
He barely survived
the balloon pump.

590
00:28:38,517 --> 00:28:40,350
His lactate is six. And holding.

591
00:28:40,419 --> 00:28:42,530
So what if it's holding?
Something is dead inside of him.

592
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:43,887
It's not gonna get undead.

593
00:28:43,955 --> 00:28:45,266
It is way too risky,
and you know it.

594
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:47,290
I would rather take the risk

595
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:49,604
than just wait for what
we know is gonna kill him.

596
00:28:49,628 --> 00:28:51,694
Stop. Stop.

597
00:28:51,764 --> 00:28:55,244
What does his healthcare directive
say about extraordinary measures?

598
00:28:58,954 --> 00:29:01,521
Whoa. I smell dead people.

599
00:29:01,589 --> 00:29:03,902
And spiders. Dead
people killed by spiders.

600
00:29:03,926 --> 00:29:06,286
Okay, let's find
his personnel file.

601
00:29:08,297 --> 00:29:10,130
Okay, I got it.

602
00:29:13,202 --> 00:29:14,801
"Webber."

603
00:29:20,459 --> 00:29:21,541
Oh, no.

604
00:29:21,627 --> 00:29:24,077
What, he doesn't have
a healthcare directive?

605
00:29:26,482 --> 00:29:29,500
No. He has one.

606
00:29:29,552 --> 00:29:31,051
I don't understand.

607
00:29:31,119 --> 00:29:34,315
Richard designated you as
his medical power of attorney.

608
00:29:34,339 --> 00:29:36,823
But he can't make me next of
kin without talking to me first.

609
00:29:36,892 --> 00:29:38,036
He did.

610
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:40,176
After Adele died, he
revised his directive.

611
00:29:40,245 --> 00:29:41,540
But... Meredith, I
know this is a shock,

612
00:29:41,564 --> 00:29:43,413
but we don't have much time.

613
00:29:43,482 --> 00:29:46,066
Right now, you need
to make a decision.

614
00:29:51,256 --> 00:29:53,234
His heart is too weak,
Meredith. His heart can take it.

615
00:29:53,258 --> 00:29:55,659
You trust me, right? You
named your baby after me.

616
00:29:55,728 --> 00:29:57,444
Hey, hey! No
personal relationships.

617
00:29:57,512 --> 00:29:59,812
The amount of electricity
he had in his body

618
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:02,694
should have killed him
instantly, but it didn't,

619
00:30:02,718 --> 00:30:05,046
which tells me that the heart
damage isn't as bad as you think.

620
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:06,336
He coded four times.

621
00:30:06,388 --> 00:30:07,553
And we got him back!

622
00:30:07,622 --> 00:30:08,850
And now you just sound idiotic.

623
00:30:08,874 --> 00:30:10,619
Dr. Yang! No, seriously.

624
00:30:10,643 --> 00:30:13,360
You sound like a family member
who googled "electrocution"

625
00:30:13,429 --> 00:30:15,212
and is trying to
remain optimistic.

626
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,014
Well, I am optimistic.

627
00:30:17,082 --> 00:30:19,632
Well, Richard should have
made Bailey his family member,

628
00:30:19,701 --> 00:30:20,912
because that is how
she's acting right now.

629
00:30:20,936 --> 00:30:22,631
- I wish he would've.
- Well, he didn't.

630
00:30:22,655 --> 00:30:23,764
He put Meredith down.

631
00:30:23,788 --> 00:30:25,222
Why would he do that?

632
00:30:25,274 --> 00:30:27,352
And she knows as well as I do

633
00:30:27,376 --> 00:30:30,343
that electric shock can
cause death of tissues

634
00:30:30,412 --> 00:30:33,413
which could start a whole
inflammatory cascade

635
00:30:33,482 --> 00:30:35,615
unless I debride
what's been damaged.

636
00:30:35,701 --> 00:30:38,446
Well, he'll have to handle it
for a day to let his heart rest.

637
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:39,747
And then... He can't handle it?

638
00:30:39,771 --> 00:30:41,215
Okay, now you
sound like an idiot.

639
00:30:41,239 --> 00:30:44,758
Letting that tissue die is like
taking a gun and killing him.

640
00:30:44,827 --> 00:30:46,292
Why wouldn't he tell me?

641
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:49,279
I don't know, but he didn't.

642
00:30:49,331 --> 00:30:52,499
And it's on you, so
you have to decide, Mer.

643
00:30:52,567 --> 00:30:55,868
Yes. Meredith, please.

644
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:01,908
Damn it.

645
00:31:04,379 --> 00:31:05,845
Just damn it.

646
00:31:05,914 --> 00:31:07,280
It's massive.

647
00:31:07,349 --> 00:31:09,366
But we can just
evacuate it, right?

648
00:31:09,434 --> 00:31:10,684
It doesn't change our plan?

649
00:31:10,753 --> 00:31:12,753
Do what we can
and hope for the best.

650
00:31:18,827 --> 00:31:21,494
Can you see her vital signs?

651
00:31:21,563 --> 00:31:23,530
Yeah. Bad.

652
00:31:23,598 --> 00:31:26,165
At least Shane's happy.
Heather's out of the competition.

653
00:31:27,436 --> 00:31:29,747
That was mean, even for you.

654
00:31:29,771 --> 00:31:31,449
It was a joke. I'm trying
to lighten the mood.

655
00:31:31,473 --> 00:31:33,435
Our friend is dying.
You don't even like her.

656
00:31:33,459 --> 00:31:35,186
Oh, my God. Just
ignore her, Steph.

657
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:37,121
Well, she usually does.

658
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:38,277
We should get back.

659
00:31:38,347 --> 00:31:39,613
I like Heather.

660
00:31:39,681 --> 00:31:40,880
I know.

661
00:31:53,145 --> 00:31:57,347
You know what I was thinking
before you guys came in here?

662
00:31:57,416 --> 00:32:01,016
I was thinking I wish my
mother were here to see my kids.

663
00:32:02,087 --> 00:32:05,705
I was wondering if she'd
make a good grandmother.

664
00:32:05,774 --> 00:32:07,941
But you know what that is?

665
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:09,609
That's delusional thinking.

666
00:32:09,678 --> 00:32:12,395
Because my mother would
make a horrible grandmother,

667
00:32:12,464 --> 00:32:15,098
because she was
a horrible mother.

668
00:32:17,369 --> 00:32:20,937
So, I'm delusional and hormonal.

669
00:32:21,006 --> 00:32:23,539
And I can't trust my
delusional thoughts.

670
00:32:23,609 --> 00:32:26,843
I have to rely on the labs.

671
00:32:26,912 --> 00:32:28,856
So we need to run
the lactate again,

672
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,081
and if it's above six, we're
going to do the surgery.

673
00:32:32,151 --> 00:32:34,311
And if it's not, we're not.

674
00:32:47,883 --> 00:32:48,965
Hey, where's Brian?

675
00:32:49,034 --> 00:32:50,834
Who's Brian? Bed three.

676
00:32:50,902 --> 00:32:52,084
Broken ribs.

677
00:32:52,153 --> 00:32:53,520
Dead fiance.

678
00:32:53,589 --> 00:32:57,069
Him. He left. One of
his friends is still missing.

679
00:32:58,676 --> 00:33:01,177
All right. Listen up, guys.

680
00:33:01,246 --> 00:33:02,289
You wanna do something

681
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:03,725
for your friends
that are hurt? Sure.

682
00:33:03,749 --> 00:33:05,326
How about donating some blood?
- We can do that.

683
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:06,711
All right, just line up
behind these doctors,

684
00:33:06,735 --> 00:33:08,868
and they're gonna help you out.

685
00:33:08,937 --> 00:33:11,604
That way they're tied to the
table and they can't take off.

686
00:33:11,673 --> 00:33:12,793
Okay.

687
00:33:16,245 --> 00:33:18,311
I'll give some blood.

688
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:21,081
I'll help the blood
bank staff get set up.

689
00:33:22,317 --> 00:33:23,957
Were you out at the pile? Yeah.

690
00:33:23,985 --> 00:33:26,964
Do you know if 5818
Shore Drive is still standing?

691
00:33:26,988 --> 00:33:29,166
It's my patient's house,
and she's worried.

692
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:31,291
Sharpie lady's
here? Sharpie lady?

693
00:33:31,359 --> 00:33:33,776
I was evacuating her when
the mudslide happened,

694
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:35,285
and she runs back in her house.

695
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:36,867
I lose it on her,
'cause I'm thinking

696
00:33:36,915 --> 00:33:38,259
she's looking for her
wallet or something,

697
00:33:38,283 --> 00:33:40,350
and I'm like, "Lady, that
crap can be replaced."

698
00:33:40,418 --> 00:33:42,319
And she comes running
out with a Sharpie

699
00:33:42,387 --> 00:33:46,556
and immediately starts digging
guys out and taking their vitals.

700
00:33:46,624 --> 00:33:48,992
That's why her
fingers are crushed.

701
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,700
I feel kind of bad
for yelling at her.

702
00:33:52,497 --> 00:33:53,863
Yeah.

703
00:33:56,668 --> 00:33:57,668
What's wrong?

704
00:33:58,737 --> 00:34:02,138
Crown molding's a badass.

705
00:34:03,475 --> 00:34:05,242
Yeah. Okay.

706
00:34:06,695 --> 00:34:07,894
Hi.

707
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:12,877
I was just thinking
about when Richard

708
00:34:12,901 --> 00:34:14,817
caught me living
in the limb room.

709
00:34:14,887 --> 00:34:19,072
I was a resident.
Before George, anyway.

710
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:21,541
I was in there
one night, and he...

711
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:24,744
Richard walked in on me
dancing in my underwear.

712
00:34:24,813 --> 00:34:27,180
I was so embarrassed.

713
00:34:27,248 --> 00:34:30,383
I mean, he was the chief.

714
00:34:39,277 --> 00:34:41,777
Are you okay? No. No, I'm...

715
00:34:44,599 --> 00:34:47,500
No, I don't dance in
my underwear anymore.

716
00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:53,339
Lactate's nine.

717
00:34:55,844 --> 00:34:56,893
Go.

718
00:35:09,674 --> 00:35:11,340
Hey.

719
00:35:11,409 --> 00:35:13,520
You agree with
Meredith's decision?

720
00:35:13,544 --> 00:35:15,378
I think it was a coin toss.

721
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:16,825
You gonna be in
there with Bailey?

722
00:35:16,849 --> 00:35:18,682
Yeah.

723
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:20,995
Okay, if he has abnormal
bleeding, give him factor VII.

724
00:35:21,019 --> 00:35:22,730
He responds to it well. Okay.

725
00:35:22,754 --> 00:35:24,415
And make sure his
pulses are checked hourly.

726
00:35:24,439 --> 00:35:27,023
That is really important.
You wanna write that down?

727
00:35:27,091 --> 00:35:28,391
No, I think I...

728
00:35:28,443 --> 00:35:30,643
Let me put that in your phone.

729
00:35:33,281 --> 00:35:35,482
You're a challenging person.

730
00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:37,567
I know.

731
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:02,792
The swelling is bad.

732
00:36:02,861 --> 00:36:05,595
Shepherd's had to open up
a bigger chunk of her skull.

733
00:36:07,482 --> 00:36:10,916
There's no way she's getting
out of this without major deficits.

734
00:36:22,363 --> 00:36:23,696
What are you doing?

735
00:36:23,765 --> 00:36:25,309
Heather's hemorrhaging.
Yeah, I heard.

736
00:36:25,333 --> 00:36:27,144
She could die. All right,
look, don't go there.

737
00:36:27,168 --> 00:36:29,630
She's my age, my class.
Her locker's right next to mine.

738
00:36:29,654 --> 00:36:31,916
I use her deodorant without
telling her, and she could die.

739
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,539
I know. It sucks.

740
00:36:34,475 --> 00:36:36,308
It all sucks.

741
00:36:48,022 --> 00:36:50,218
Wait, wait. This is bad.
We shouldn't. Yeah.

742
00:36:50,242 --> 00:36:52,162
But I want to. Okay.

743
00:36:52,761 --> 00:36:54,393
Wait.

744
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:56,822
Did you have sex with any
of my friends in this closet?

745
00:36:57,298 --> 00:36:59,082
Uh...

746
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:01,451
Okay. No. This isn't
happening. I gotta go.

747
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:02,785
Whoa...

748
00:37:03,772 --> 00:37:05,732
Oh! Hey. Hey.

749
00:37:08,193 --> 00:37:09,654
I was just gonna
get some lidocaine,

750
00:37:09,678 --> 00:37:11,755
but I'm not gonna slip
on a used condom, am I?

751
00:37:11,779 --> 00:37:13,825
Screw you. Yeah.

752
00:37:13,849 --> 00:37:15,893
Did you hear the news about
me being a big slut got out?

753
00:37:15,917 --> 00:37:17,550
Yeah.

754
00:37:17,619 --> 00:37:18,934
It's mortifying.

755
00:37:19,003 --> 00:37:21,354
But I mean, I think that
we're gonna be okay.

756
00:37:21,423 --> 00:37:23,689
I think it's gonna
make us stronger.

757
00:37:23,758 --> 00:37:25,375
Like a bone.

758
00:37:25,443 --> 00:37:27,343
Sometimes you have to...

759
00:37:27,412 --> 00:37:29,023
You have to break it in
order for it to heal correctly.

760
00:37:29,047 --> 00:37:31,247
And I think that
maybe Callie and I...

761
00:37:33,785 --> 00:37:35,401
That's what I was
gonna tell Callie.

762
00:37:35,469 --> 00:37:41,291
Like, an ortho metaphor?
What do you think?

763
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:43,927
I think you should stick to
"I'm sorry I'm such a slut."

764
00:37:45,897 --> 00:37:48,231
Yeah. Good call.

765
00:37:51,419 --> 00:37:53,219
Hey, Mrs. Ashford.

766
00:37:53,288 --> 00:37:56,448
You wanna press against my
hands with the bottoms of your feet?

767
00:37:57,859 --> 00:38:00,171
I heard you're kind of a hero.

768
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:03,730
Oh, my God. Okay.

769
00:38:03,799 --> 00:38:06,449
Mrs. Ashford. I could
use some help over here!

770
00:38:06,518 --> 00:38:08,379
You're gonna be good, Dougie,
okay? You're gonna be fine.

771
00:38:08,403 --> 00:38:11,971
Douglas Lauenstein, multiple
crush injuries, BP 105 over 72.

772
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:15,040
Get him up to trauma three. Hey,
where do you think you're going?

773
00:38:17,595 --> 00:38:20,914
Sash, we got him.
He was still in the rig.

774
00:38:20,982 --> 00:38:22,214
Is he gonna be okay?

775
00:38:22,283 --> 00:38:24,529
Yeah, he's gonna be okay,
but I gotta head back out.

776
00:38:24,553 --> 00:38:25,980
We're trying to
stabilize the area,

777
00:38:26,004 --> 00:38:27,281
make sure we don't
lose any more houses.

778
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:28,900
You're not going anywhere.
You're still bleeding.

779
00:38:28,924 --> 00:38:31,119
Well, just patch me up.
No, I already did that.

780
00:38:31,143 --> 00:38:32,386
Well, maybe this guy can help.

781
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:34,878
All right, Sasha, we just
got your studies back,

782
00:38:34,929 --> 00:38:36,941
and this is
necrotizing fasciitis.

783
00:38:36,965 --> 00:38:40,060
It is aggressive, and we need to
get you up to surgery right away.

784
00:38:40,084 --> 00:38:41,450
How did I...

785
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:42,780
The water and the mud
that you were stuck in,

786
00:38:42,804 --> 00:38:43,997
both of those are
breeding grounds

787
00:38:44,021 --> 00:38:45,383
for this type of
bacteria. Well, wait...

788
00:38:45,407 --> 00:38:46,884
It's a flesh-eating
bacteria, Brian, all right?

789
00:38:46,908 --> 00:38:48,286
What's most important
is that we get her prepped

790
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:50,042
and ready right away. Let's go.

791
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:58,618
<i>A doctor puts on his
white coat to save lives,</i>

792
00:38:59,454 --> 00:39:01,855
<i>defy death,</i>

793
00:39:01,923 --> 00:39:06,325
<i>but once he takes it
off, he's vulnerable,</i>

794
00:39:06,394 --> 00:39:08,714
<i>just like anybody else.</i>

795
00:39:10,515 --> 00:39:11,715
<i>Human.</i>

796
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:36,589
Ma'am, I'm Dr. Kepner.

797
00:39:36,658 --> 00:39:40,994
I worked on your husband.
Would you like to see him?

798
00:39:42,297 --> 00:39:43,680
Okay.

799
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:47,316
<i>We're all gonna die.</i>

800
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:52,738
<i>We don't get much
say over how or when.</i>

801
00:39:54,442 --> 00:39:56,459
His ring.

802
00:39:56,528 --> 00:39:58,261
Thought you'd want it back.

803
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:00,996
I'm so, so sorry.

804
00:40:01,066 --> 00:40:03,515
<i>But we do get to decide
how we're gonna live.</i>

805
00:40:05,954 --> 00:40:07,620
<i>So do it.</i>

806
00:40:09,107 --> 00:40:10,740
<i>Decide.</i>

807
00:40:12,143 --> 00:40:14,577
<i>Is this the life
you want to live?</i>

808
00:40:16,731 --> 00:40:19,048
<i>Is this the person
you want to love?</i>

809
00:40:42,607 --> 00:40:45,141
<i>Is this the best you can be?</i>

810
00:40:47,479 --> 00:40:49,579
<i>Can you be stronger?</i>

811
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:54,083
<i>Kinder?</i>

812
00:40:54,152 --> 00:40:57,854
Be a good friend. Tell me
I made the right decision.

813
00:40:57,923 --> 00:41:00,723
<i>More compassionate?</i>

814
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:03,026
You made the right decision.

815
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:08,581
Damn it. There's blood
in the temporal horn.

816
00:41:08,667 --> 00:41:10,545
I have to do a
temporal lobectomy.

817
00:41:10,569 --> 00:41:12,101
Dr. Shepherd.

818
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:13,281
She'll have motor and
memory deficits if you...

819
00:41:13,305 --> 00:41:14,853
I'm trying to save her life.

820
00:41:17,425 --> 00:41:18,925
This is my fault.

821
00:41:18,993 --> 00:41:20,393
Shane.

822
00:41:20,461 --> 00:41:21,627
No, I did this.

823
00:41:21,695 --> 00:41:23,573
You didn't do anything.
This is not your fault.

824
00:41:23,597 --> 00:41:25,497
This just happened.

825
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:28,913
Now I can't have you in here
if you can't hold it together.

826
00:41:28,937 --> 00:41:30,403
Can you be in here?

827
00:41:31,756 --> 00:41:33,456
<i>Decide.</i>

828
00:41:35,927 --> 00:41:37,259
Yeah.

829
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:38,595
Dissectors.

830
00:41:38,663 --> 00:41:39,996
<i>Breathe in.</i>

831
00:41:40,064 --> 00:41:41,831
Tell me again.

832
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:46,452
<i>Breathe out.</i>

833
00:41:46,521 --> 00:41:48,220
You made the right decision.

834
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:50,539
<i>And decide.</i>

835
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:05,471
10 blade.
