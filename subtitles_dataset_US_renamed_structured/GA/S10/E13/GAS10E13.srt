1
00:00:02,203 --> 00:00:03,035
<i>Previously on</i> Grey's Anatomy...

2
00:00:03,104 --> 00:00:04,536
<i>Alex, you have a father.</i>

3
00:00:04,604 --> 00:00:06,132
<i>I know, and he's a dirtbag.</i>

4
00:00:06,156 --> 00:00:07,901
<i>Mr. Evans? I paged
you to get Yang.</i>

5
00:00:07,925 --> 00:00:09,585
Yang's at the wedding. I'm here.

6
00:00:09,609 --> 00:00:11,237
<i>Dr. Derek Shepherd?</i> DEREK: Yes.

7
00:00:11,261 --> 00:00:13,573
<i>Please hold for the
President of the United States.</i>

8
00:00:13,597 --> 00:00:15,113
I cannot believe
we're doing this!

9
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:17,127
All this blood...
Doctor? Bypass...

10
00:00:17,151 --> 00:00:18,867
I have it! 2-0 silk!

11
00:00:18,936 --> 00:00:22,004
Maybe it's time we talked about uh,
why the hell you up and quit surgery.

12
00:00:22,072 --> 00:00:23,516
What do we got here, son?

13
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:24,906
I did this. It's my fault.

14
00:00:24,975 --> 00:00:26,842
I love you, April.

15
00:00:26,911 --> 00:00:28,560
I always have.

16
00:00:28,629 --> 00:00:31,329
And I think that you
love me, too. Do you?

17
00:00:40,107 --> 00:00:42,441
<i>Every day, a surgeon
makes decisions</i>

18
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:44,876
<i>that can go one of two ways,</i>

19
00:00:44,945 --> 00:00:49,647
<i>either very good or
very, very, very bad.</i>

20
00:00:59,276 --> 00:01:02,577
<i>The problem is, the
epically great decisions</i>

21
00:01:02,646 --> 00:01:04,245
<i>and the epically bad ones</i>

22
00:01:04,315 --> 00:01:07,616
<i>look exactly the same
when you're making them.</i>

23
00:01:13,691 --> 00:01:15,001
April, do you...

24
00:01:15,025 --> 00:01:17,345
Do you not want to do this?

25
00:01:37,531 --> 00:01:38,980
Drive the car.

26
00:01:45,739 --> 00:01:47,650
Meredith, when the
President of the United States

27
00:01:47,674 --> 00:01:49,474
calls you on the
phone... I get it.

28
00:01:49,543 --> 00:01:50,809
You can't say no to the guy.

29
00:01:50,877 --> 00:01:52,110
Nope.

30
00:01:52,179 --> 00:01:53,657
I mean, when they start
putting government money

31
00:01:53,681 --> 00:01:56,315
behind a program like that,
mapping the human brain,

32
00:01:56,383 --> 00:01:58,366
the impact that that
has worldwide is just...

33
00:01:58,435 --> 00:02:00,836
Big impact. Get me
my curling iron, please.

34
00:02:00,905 --> 00:02:04,072
The weeping sisters have gone
through every tissue in this building.

35
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,552
Did you get the mother
to calm down, at least?

36
00:02:05,576 --> 00:02:08,109
I tried. But how was I
supposed to pretend

37
00:02:08,178 --> 00:02:10,640
that what just happened wasn't
the coolest thing I'd ever seen?

38
00:02:10,664 --> 00:02:11,929
Cristina...

39
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:13,510
You know, I've always been
on the fence about Kepner,

40
00:02:13,534 --> 00:02:15,334
but now I'm not just
a friend, I'm a fan.

41
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:22,223
Was that about me?
No, it's about me.

42
00:02:22,292 --> 00:02:24,738
The President called, and I have to
go back on a promise I made to her.

43
00:02:24,762 --> 00:02:25,962
Oh, good. Better you than me.

44
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:28,391
President? Of the United States.

45
00:02:28,415 --> 00:02:30,349
You are not serious. Mm.

46
00:02:34,805 --> 00:02:37,238
Something's going
on at the hospital.

47
00:02:37,307 --> 00:02:38,485
I want him fired! OWEN: Karev...

48
00:02:38,509 --> 00:02:39,749
I want him arrested!

49
00:02:39,777 --> 00:02:41,688
Webber is watching over
your father like a hawk.

50
00:02:41,712 --> 00:02:44,707
His vitals are stable, and we're gonna
do our best to keep it that way, okay?

51
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:45,992
What the hell was
this kid thinking?

52
00:02:46,016 --> 00:02:47,215
He wasn't thinking.

53
00:02:47,284 --> 00:02:49,596
Yeah, no kidding.
He was hallucinating.

54
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,136
He had no idea
what was happening.

55
00:02:51,205 --> 00:02:52,866
He thought the patient on
the table was Heather Brooks.

56
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:54,456
Oh, my God. What?

57
00:02:54,524 --> 00:02:56,036
He showed me how to fudge
your hours in the system,

58
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:58,054
so you can continue working
without having to sleep.

59
00:02:58,078 --> 00:02:59,110
For God's sakes...

60
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:00,612
I'll find him.

61
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:02,175
Cristina's on her
way. She's gonna...

62
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:03,709
No, Yang is not touching
him. Alex, I think...

63
00:03:03,733 --> 00:03:05,195
If that kid messed
up, it's on her.

64
00:03:05,219 --> 00:03:06,796
She lets him think
he runs the place.

65
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,865
Why do you think he hacked
up Jimmy's heart all on his own?

66
00:03:08,889 --> 00:03:10,200
Let's just wait until
we get all the facts...

67
00:03:10,224 --> 00:03:11,344
She's screwing him!

68
00:03:14,261 --> 00:03:15,722
Would you just take
a breath for a second?

69
00:03:15,746 --> 00:03:17,207
This one doesn't
even have a card!

70
00:03:17,231 --> 00:03:19,191
How is April supposed
to return her gift

71
00:03:19,215 --> 00:03:20,292
if we can't even manage to
keep the gifts with the card?

72
00:03:20,316 --> 00:03:23,184
Okay, we'll find the
cards. Arizona! Stop.

73
00:03:23,253 --> 00:03:25,420
We will fix it. No! We won't!

74
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,239
That's the whole problem.

75
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:30,492
You've been trying
to fix it, our marriage.

76
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,222
You've been trying to fix
me, and you're so good!

77
00:03:32,246 --> 00:03:34,395
You're killing
yourself just to fix me!

78
00:03:34,465 --> 00:03:35,641
You don't have to apologize...

79
00:03:35,665 --> 00:03:37,749
I'm not! That's the point!

80
00:03:37,818 --> 00:03:40,552
Because I'm not the same
person that I was before,

81
00:03:40,621 --> 00:03:43,154
and I don't want to apologize,
and I don't want to be fixed.

82
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,601
Whoa, whoa. I'm
not the same person

83
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:45,968
I was before, either,
but that doesn't...

84
00:03:45,992 --> 00:03:48,093
It's not working,
and you know it!

85
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:50,611
You knew before I did.

86
00:03:53,784 --> 00:03:55,383
Okay, can we just go home

87
00:03:55,452 --> 00:03:57,752
and sit down and
talk about this?

88
00:03:57,821 --> 00:04:00,655
It's not my home anymore.

89
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,360
Maybe you could
stop acting like a child...

90
00:04:06,396 --> 00:04:09,664
Now I'm a child. That's
great. That's great.

91
00:04:09,733 --> 00:04:11,466
I'm childish. I caused your OCD.

92
00:04:11,534 --> 00:04:13,669
What else you got? Did
I cause global warming?

93
00:04:13,737 --> 00:04:15,782
Maybe I killed JFK! That
would explain a lot, right?

94
00:04:15,806 --> 00:04:17,589
You quit surgery!

95
00:04:17,658 --> 00:04:20,036
See, this was supposed to be
different than my first marriage.

96
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:23,194
I thought you understood
what it means to be a surgeon!

97
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,163
Until you dropped it!

98
00:04:25,231 --> 00:04:28,232
And now, here I am, once
again, married to a man

99
00:04:28,302 --> 00:04:31,619
who's waiting to see
me at the end of the day,

100
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:35,140
waiting to see what I'm gonna
do, when I'm gonna come home!

101
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:40,645
You think I was happy to walk
away from a surgical residency?

102
00:04:40,713 --> 00:04:43,293
You think you were, what, a
convenient excuse to dump it?

103
00:04:43,317 --> 00:04:46,251
Well, yes. No, I
was a damned star!

104
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,398
I had found what I'd been
looking for, for decades,

105
00:04:48,422 --> 00:04:49,988
and I walked away from it, yes,

106
00:04:50,057 --> 00:04:51,690
because I wanted
to be here with you!

107
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,627
And it was the hardest
choice I ever had to make.

108
00:04:55,696 --> 00:04:57,006
You didn't want
to leave surgery?

109
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:00,248
No! I did not want
to leave surgery.

110
00:05:03,853 --> 00:05:06,204
Hey. Still no Shane. I'm
gonna try his apartment.

111
00:05:06,272 --> 00:05:08,890
If he's dead on the side of
the road, I am going to lose it.

112
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:12,444
Could you take her home?
She's had a rough day.

113
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:14,524
At a wedding? What, you
drank too much champagne?

114
00:05:14,548 --> 00:05:16,914
You have blisters on your
feet from all the dancing?

115
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:19,384
My boyfriend ran
off with the bride.

116
00:05:19,452 --> 00:05:21,402
What? There was no dancing.

117
00:05:22,472 --> 00:05:23,888
I'm gonna find you a ride home,

118
00:05:23,957 --> 00:05:26,102
and as soon as things calm
down with Alex and his dad,

119
00:05:26,126 --> 00:05:29,995
I'm gonna come over and we're
gonna drink a lot and burn things.

120
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:31,596
Can you wait five minutes?

121
00:05:53,303 --> 00:05:56,371
<i>Jackson, pull over.
Jackson, just pull over the car.</i>

122
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:57,617
Just... What is it?

123
00:05:57,641 --> 00:06:00,242
Jackson, please, just
pull over the car now!

124
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:01,843
Relax.

125
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:06,447
Just calm down. Calm down?

126
00:06:07,684 --> 00:06:10,702
What are we doing?
Is there a plan?

127
00:06:10,771 --> 00:06:11,953
There's no plan.

128
00:06:12,022 --> 00:06:13,833
You think I would plan
to ruin your wedding?

129
00:06:13,857 --> 00:06:16,090
No, no! That doesn't
seem like you.

130
00:06:18,344 --> 00:06:20,044
All right, April, look...

131
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:23,798
I can't. I'm sorry. We
can't do this. I can't.

132
00:06:37,697 --> 00:06:39,330
They'll fix the gutters,

133
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,844
the water damage in
the bedroom, all of it.

134
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:45,370
You know, I rarely see a
deal go through this fast.

135
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:47,316
You were really ready to move.

136
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,390
Yeah, sometimes you
just need a fresh start.

137
00:06:49,459 --> 00:06:50,659
Congratulations.

138
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:56,158
Um, I'm not sure we should be
popping the champagne just yet.

139
00:06:56,182 --> 00:06:57,861
There's a man-sized
blood stain in the bedroom.

140
00:06:57,885 --> 00:06:59,262
Now, they said they'd
replace the carpet

141
00:06:59,286 --> 00:07:00,568
before the close of escrow.

142
00:07:00,637 --> 00:07:02,103
It's rust.

143
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:03,400
I think they said the
carpet guy's coming today.

144
00:07:03,424 --> 00:07:05,568
Let me call them. Yeah.

145
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:09,477
It's beautiful. And
it's gonna be ours.

146
00:07:09,546 --> 00:07:11,445
It's a murder house.

147
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:14,049
Callie. Try.

148
00:07:14,117 --> 00:07:15,616
It's...

149
00:07:17,387 --> 00:07:19,587
kind of beautiful.

150
00:07:22,392 --> 00:07:25,159
Paging Dr. Man...
Dr. Sharp-Dressed Man.

151
00:07:25,228 --> 00:07:27,228
I have kind of a
big thing today.

152
00:07:27,297 --> 00:07:28,662
Me, too.

153
00:07:28,731 --> 00:07:30,743
Rounds with Webber in
20, followed by an ER shift,

154
00:07:30,767 --> 00:07:33,012
that, fingers crossed,
could lead to my assisting

155
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:35,536
on any number of grisly
traumas this afternoon.

156
00:07:35,605 --> 00:07:37,105
What's your thing?

157
00:07:37,173 --> 00:07:39,507
I'm being vetted
by the White House.

158
00:07:39,575 --> 00:07:41,504
So it's kind of a big
day for both of us.

159
00:07:41,528 --> 00:07:42,689
If Steph doesn't
want to talk about it,

160
00:07:42,713 --> 00:07:43,823
we can't force it.

161
00:07:43,847 --> 00:07:45,224
It's been three
weeks, and we haven't

162
00:07:45,248 --> 00:07:47,398
been able to get
one scrap of real intel

163
00:07:47,468 --> 00:07:49,634
on what happened
between Kepner and Avery.

164
00:07:49,703 --> 00:07:52,103
They're avoiding each
other, she's avoiding us,

165
00:07:52,172 --> 00:07:54,522
and nobody's saying anything.

166
00:07:54,591 --> 00:07:55,834
Warren, you sit at
the grown-ups' table.

167
00:07:55,858 --> 00:07:57,125
You have to know something.

168
00:07:57,194 --> 00:07:58,493
Mm-mmm. I don't like gossip.

169
00:07:58,562 --> 00:07:59,811
I don't like you.

170
00:08:01,482 --> 00:08:03,281
Steph! Oh, my God, hi!

171
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,761
You came out of hiding! Yay!

172
00:08:04,785 --> 00:08:06,767
I haven't been in hiding.

173
00:08:06,836 --> 00:08:09,670
Okay, I've been
in hiding, but...

174
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:12,506
Time heals wounds or whatever.

175
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:15,026
Really? Yeah, absolutely.

176
00:08:15,094 --> 00:08:17,612
That's Shane's gear. Is he back?

177
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,147
I haven't seen him.

178
00:08:19,216 --> 00:08:21,243
I can't believe the board
decided to let him come back.

179
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:23,129
Yeah, I bet a couple
weeks' rest did him good.

180
00:08:23,153 --> 00:08:25,437
He's a good kid who
went down a bad road.

181
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:26,705
Can it, Pops.

182
00:08:28,876 --> 00:08:30,441
How old do you
people think I am?

183
00:08:31,595 --> 00:08:32,675
Forty-nine.

184
00:08:34,698 --> 00:08:36,915
Ben Warren, you
forgot your lunch.

185
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:38,516
You didn't have
to do that, baby.

186
00:08:38,585 --> 00:08:40,018
I was gonna go to the cafeteria.

187
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:43,571
You do that, you're gonna
grab a pizza or a burger

188
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,535
and then come complaining
to me about heartburn,

189
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:47,840
and I don't want to hear it.

190
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:52,480
Can I change my answer?

191
00:08:52,548 --> 00:08:54,193
'Cause now I want
to say you're 12.

192
00:08:55,568 --> 00:08:56,868
You told her what?

193
00:08:56,937 --> 00:08:58,414
She's been dodging
my calls for weeks.

194
00:08:58,438 --> 00:09:00,282
Someone needs to take
responsibility for Jimmy,

195
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:02,251
and it's not gonna be me.
Technically, they're still married.

196
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:03,419
Yeah, but you can't just lie.

197
00:09:03,443 --> 00:09:05,883
Turns out I can.
It's really easy.

198
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:09,730
Good God, you look
just like your father.

199
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,067
Sorry. Alex. This is
my fiancee, Jo Wilson.

200
00:09:14,704 --> 00:09:15,982
Naomi. Right.

201
00:09:16,006 --> 00:09:18,206
Well, we're gonna walk this way.

202
00:09:21,461 --> 00:09:23,945
MVC pileup at the
downtown waterfront.

203
00:09:24,013 --> 00:09:26,748
We've got multiple victims
coming in here, people! Be careful!

204
00:09:26,817 --> 00:09:28,661
Cars took out a bunch
of pedestrians, too.

205
00:09:28,685 --> 00:09:29,895
Was she conscious
in the field? Nope.

206
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:31,853
Okay, let's get her
to trauma room four.

207
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,274
Ross! I need hands.

208
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:39,627
Ross, stay where you
are. You're with me today.

209
00:09:39,696 --> 00:09:41,229
Edwards, go help Avery.

210
00:09:41,298 --> 00:09:42,730
Avery?

211
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:45,867
No. Sorry... Not Edwards. Okay.

212
00:09:45,935 --> 00:09:47,969
Warren, Avery needs hands.

213
00:09:48,038 --> 00:09:49,678
Now, hang on a second.
Warren's with me.

214
00:09:49,706 --> 00:09:51,072
You can't break up the big dogs.

215
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:52,840
Webber, I'm having
enough trouble

216
00:09:52,909 --> 00:09:54,559
juggling who can work with who.

217
00:09:54,628 --> 00:09:55,893
Don't make it any harder.

218
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:57,490
For God's sake,
I'll go with Avery.

219
00:09:57,514 --> 00:10:00,147
Wouldn't want to break up
the "old dogs" or anything.

220
00:10:00,216 --> 00:10:01,382
It's "big dogs."

221
00:10:02,485 --> 00:10:04,502
No, not a dog.

222
00:10:04,571 --> 00:10:07,739
It was a cat. A really big cat.

223
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:10,241
- Coming through!
- Another incoming!

224
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:12,221
Pedestrian, hit by a
car, vitals are stable.

225
00:10:12,245 --> 00:10:13,323
Possible fracture
to the right arm.

226
00:10:13,347 --> 00:10:14,347
Holy crap!

227
00:10:16,483 --> 00:10:19,584
You know, it's not my face
that's injured. It's my arm.

228
00:10:25,058 --> 00:10:26,058
Meow.

229
00:10:28,695 --> 00:10:29,711
Over there.

230
00:10:29,779 --> 00:10:30,859
Oh, okay.

231
00:10:32,649 --> 00:10:34,627
Dr. Shepherd. Miles
Green. This is Rita Belmont.

232
00:10:34,651 --> 00:10:36,317
Nice to meet you,
Miles. Rita, pleasure.

233
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:37,485
Sorry I'm late.

234
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:39,365
Yeah, we knew you'd be late.

235
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:42,669
We've been tracking your
phone since last we spoke.

236
00:10:43,026 --> 00:10:44,587
No, I'm messing with you!

237
00:10:44,611 --> 00:10:48,062
We don't track your phone.
Come on, have a seat. I'm sorry.

238
00:10:48,131 --> 00:10:49,697
But don't kid yourself,

239
00:10:49,765 --> 00:10:52,511
because we do know a crazy
amount of stuff about you.

240
00:10:52,535 --> 00:10:55,386
Now, the White House requires a
deeper-than-normal background check

241
00:10:55,455 --> 00:10:57,366
on anyone associated with
the President's programs,

242
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:00,058
so this process can
get a little personal.

243
00:11:00,127 --> 00:11:01,203
I understand. Great.

244
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:03,795
So, you know, let's just

245
00:11:03,864 --> 00:11:06,125
ask you a few questions, eat a
little lunch, and go home happy.

246
00:11:06,149 --> 00:11:10,251
What do you say? Okay.
Let's start with your wife.

247
00:11:10,319 --> 00:11:13,759
So, you two met when she was
a student of yours, was she not?

248
00:11:14,858 --> 00:11:16,974
Yeah, I suppose.

249
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:18,209
Hmm.

250
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:19,744
Is that bad?

251
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:26,117
Hey. You feel like getting
out of the lab for half a day?

252
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:29,687
I've got an aortic
aneurysm repair.

253
00:11:29,756 --> 00:11:31,834
Really? You want
to do it together?

254
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:34,158
Unless you're busy
or don't want to.

255
00:11:34,227 --> 00:11:36,522
No, I'd love to.
Sure. Are you sure?

256
00:11:36,546 --> 00:11:38,363
Positive. It'd be fun, right?

257
00:11:38,432 --> 00:11:39,830
Okay. Great.

258
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:42,945
And I was just
walking down the street

259
00:11:42,969 --> 00:11:44,681
and some chick blows
through a red light.

260
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:46,571
Six-car smash-up.

261
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:48,284
One even comes
up on the sidewalk

262
00:11:48,308 --> 00:11:49,657
and takes me out.

263
00:11:49,725 --> 00:11:51,025
Stupid woman.

264
00:11:51,094 --> 00:11:53,222
His pupils are unresponsive.
Those are contacts, right?

265
00:11:53,246 --> 00:11:54,411
Yes.

266
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,579
And the teeth are...

267
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:57,929
Veneers, permanent.
Whiskers, piercings.

268
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,550
Ooh.

269
00:11:59,619 --> 00:12:03,088
So, you guys gonna
doctor me up or what?

270
00:12:03,156 --> 00:12:04,901
He complained of
abdominal tenderness.

271
00:12:04,925 --> 00:12:07,692
Right, get a CT to
rule out internal injuries,

272
00:12:07,761 --> 00:12:09,260
and then we'll fix the arm.

273
00:12:11,098 --> 00:12:12,363
You know what?

274
00:12:12,432 --> 00:12:15,244
There was a little kid out
there, cracked her head open.

275
00:12:15,268 --> 00:12:16,729
Is she okay? We can find out.

276
00:12:16,753 --> 00:12:18,497
Yeah, you know what?
Let's just worry about

277
00:12:18,521 --> 00:12:21,372
getting you out of here with
all of your nine lives, okay?

278
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:26,927
Hustle up, Ross. You're trying to
protect her airway, not make it worse.

279
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:28,513
Epiglottis is in the way.

280
00:12:28,582 --> 00:12:30,347
I can't see the...

281
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,533
Dr. Warren, take
over for Dr. Ross.

282
00:12:32,602 --> 00:12:34,469
I'm sorry.

283
00:12:41,744 --> 00:12:42,984
Mm-hmm.

284
00:12:45,832 --> 00:12:48,577
Now, that is how a
second-year resident intubates.

285
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,479
Okay, Ross, go find her phone.

286
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:52,703
See if she has any
emergency contacts listed,

287
00:12:52,773 --> 00:12:55,653
unless you want Dr. Warren
to show you how to do that, too.

288
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:03,567
Ross is still a little fragile.

289
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,661
That kind of tough
love may wash him out

290
00:13:05,685 --> 00:13:07,897
before he has a chance
to get back on his feet.

291
00:13:07,921 --> 00:13:09,553
You don't mistake
any of this for love.

292
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,222
If I had my way, he
would not be here.

293
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,269
If the board want to go
against my recommendation

294
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:14,653
and bring him back, that's fine.

295
00:13:14,677 --> 00:13:16,189
But I'm still the
Chief of Surgery,

296
00:13:16,213 --> 00:13:18,346
so I will deal with
him as I see fit.

297
00:13:21,751 --> 00:13:23,362
You didn't bring your son.

298
00:13:23,386 --> 00:13:24,930
Wasn't any reason
to bring Nicky.

299
00:13:24,954 --> 00:13:26,332
I'm really only
here for that guitar.

300
00:13:26,356 --> 00:13:28,567
You can do whatever you
want with the rest of his stuff.

301
00:13:28,591 --> 00:13:31,525
Keep it, toss it.
Dealer's choice.

302
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:38,766
What the hell is
this? He's not dead?

303
00:13:38,834 --> 00:13:40,201
No.

304
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:41,990
You lied to me. Yeah.

305
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:55,033
You know, this is our first surgery
together since everything fell apart.

306
00:13:55,101 --> 00:13:57,552
I know. I'm enjoying it.

307
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:00,571
Me, too, but I have a question
that might ruin the mood.

308
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,207
Well, just ask your question.

309
00:14:02,275 --> 00:14:04,608
Where is Shane?

310
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:07,723
After the way you pushed
us all to let him come back...

311
00:14:07,747 --> 00:14:11,248
You were right about him.
I should've seen it coming.

312
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:13,117
I am so pissed at him,

313
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:16,654
I'm afraid if I see him again,
I'll rip his arms out by the root.

314
00:14:16,723 --> 00:14:18,840
Plus, Alex just started
talking to me again.

315
00:14:18,908 --> 00:14:22,020
The parenting books say when
your kid does something wrong,

316
00:14:22,044 --> 00:14:24,573
you have to put your anger
aside when you talk to them.

317
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:26,213
Is that how you're
dealing with Derek?

318
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:27,815
Totally.

319
00:14:27,884 --> 00:14:31,418
And what's awesome is, the
nicer I am, the guiltier he feels.

320
00:14:31,488 --> 00:14:33,399
It's the only fun I have lately.

321
00:14:33,423 --> 00:14:35,556
Mer, the President
called him personally.

322
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:38,693
You really want to defend him when
we were having such a good time?

323
00:14:38,761 --> 00:14:39,971
You're right. Screw the guy.

324
00:14:39,995 --> 00:14:41,579
Thank you.

325
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:45,116
A proposal's a big deal.
You remember a proposal.

326
00:14:45,185 --> 00:14:47,652
Was I drunk? Do
I drink too much?

327
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:49,621
You do drink a
lot. Screw your life.

328
00:14:49,689 --> 00:14:51,138
Screw your perfect little life.

329
00:14:51,207 --> 00:14:54,527
What part of "accidentally
engaged" sounds perfect to you?

330
00:14:54,895 --> 00:14:57,461
Oh, my God. It
was at the wedding.

331
00:14:57,530 --> 00:15:00,031
Stop talking about
weddings and engagements.

332
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:02,294
She just got left at the
altar. No, she wasn't.

333
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:03,834
She was left near an altar.

334
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:06,020
Ow! What?

335
00:15:06,088 --> 00:15:08,840
Sorry, I just... I needed
the CT. For a patient.

336
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,090
My patient needs a CT.

337
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,526
We're almost done.

338
00:15:11,594 --> 00:15:14,062
Great! Cool. Take your time.
I want you to have it, really.

339
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:16,680
I'll just come back later.

340
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,599
What a bitch. Totes.

341
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:20,862
You need closure. Why don't
you just go talk to Jackson?

342
00:15:20,886 --> 00:15:22,820
Why don't you just
go talk to your fiance?

343
00:15:34,334 --> 00:15:36,200
This can't be legal.

344
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:38,764
You can't just call someone up
and say "he's dead" if it's not true.

345
00:15:38,788 --> 00:15:40,120
Well, he is dying.

346
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:41,723
He's septic. His
organs are failing.

347
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:43,424
He's got a few days at the most.

348
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:45,709
Look, he knows you're coming.

349
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:48,107
So, what, I'm supposed to
sit in there, hold his hand,

350
00:15:48,131 --> 00:15:51,227
and kiss away his tears like
he wasn't a complete bastard?

351
00:15:51,251 --> 00:15:53,111
That guitar belonged
to my father.

352
00:15:53,135 --> 00:15:55,163
Left me three of
them when he died.

353
00:15:55,187 --> 00:15:56,738
Jimmy pawned the other two.

354
00:15:56,806 --> 00:15:59,540
One day, the third one
disappeared. And so did he.

355
00:15:59,609 --> 00:16:00,953
Look, it all started
because he came in here

356
00:16:00,977 --> 00:16:02,860
trying to get clean
for you and Nicky.

357
00:16:02,928 --> 00:16:04,895
I mean, it was
hell, but he did it.

358
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,398
At this point, I think
you're the only reason

359
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:09,233
he's still trying to hang on.

360
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:11,035
Don't bail on him now.

361
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,601
I was with Jimmy for five years.

362
00:16:26,669 --> 00:16:30,037
I know what it sounds
like when he's full of crap.

363
00:16:30,106 --> 00:16:32,339
You are 100% his son.

364
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:40,781
It took 15 surgeries total.

365
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:42,182
Wow.

366
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:43,951
Spent everything I had.

367
00:16:44,019 --> 00:16:47,705
How many people do you know
that are unhappy with who they are?

368
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:49,434
And do they do
anything to change it?

369
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:51,459
'Cause, see, I
didn't like who I was.

370
00:16:51,527 --> 00:16:54,773
But I had the balls to
become who I wanted to be.

371
00:16:54,797 --> 00:16:56,163
I committed.

372
00:16:56,232 --> 00:16:57,832
Some people get
a gym membership.

373
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,368
You went all-in. I like it.

374
00:17:01,388 --> 00:17:04,889
How's it go over
with the ladies?

375
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:08,070
Well, you know, I had a
girlfriend when I started all this.

376
00:17:08,094 --> 00:17:10,461
She loved it.

377
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:14,098
You know, but that ended and...

378
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:17,446
Listen, let's just
say the Cat Man

379
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:19,790
gets more than his
share of tail, okay?

380
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:20,905
Okay.

381
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:22,933
That's all I'm saying. Yeah.

382
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,993
Ow. Ow.

383
00:17:26,061 --> 00:17:30,130
Hey, what's the word on that
little kid? She wake up yet?

384
00:17:30,199 --> 00:17:34,201
Well, I am so sorry, but patient
information's confidential, so...

385
00:17:34,269 --> 00:17:35,753
It's bad news, then, huh?

386
00:17:42,495 --> 00:17:45,095
All right, you can go ahead
and remove those clamps.

387
00:17:50,052 --> 00:17:52,197
Is there something you need
to say to me, Dr. Murphy?

388
00:17:52,221 --> 00:17:54,541
You couldn't have
given her a heads-up,

389
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:57,057
in the months you
were seeing each other?

390
00:17:57,126 --> 00:17:58,403
She was worried about Kepner.

391
00:17:58,427 --> 00:18:01,106
She asked about it, and
you didn't say anything.

392
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:04,042
What, were you just waiting for the
right time to publicly humiliate her?

393
00:18:09,439 --> 00:18:11,433
I could've just kept working.
I didn't even have to ask you.

394
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:12,656
Why the hell did I ask you?

395
00:18:12,725 --> 00:18:14,419
I guess you have a
problem with impulse control.

396
00:18:14,443 --> 00:18:16,860
I have been trying to
apologize to her for weeks now.

397
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:20,097
She walks away the
moment she sees me coming.

398
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:24,201
I am miserable
about what I did to her.

399
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,470
I had no idea I was gonna do it.

400
00:18:26,539 --> 00:18:28,656
Not till the moment it happened.

401
00:18:29,542 --> 00:18:32,009
Still, Steph's alone,

402
00:18:32,078 --> 00:18:34,158
Kepner's alone, you're alone.

403
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:36,447
Everybody's pretty miserable.

404
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:40,551
Seems like it all worked
out really well, doesn't it?

405
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:43,287
Dr. Murphy, I'm gonna get
back to fixing this man's arm.

406
00:18:43,356 --> 00:18:45,623
Now, you can glare
at me all you want to,

407
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:47,808
but you are gonna help.

408
00:18:51,764 --> 00:18:53,842
They were all just
staring at me, judging me,

409
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:55,746
with their little resident eyes.

410
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:57,279
Like they used to stare
at you. Cheater eyes.

411
00:18:57,303 --> 00:18:58,814
Ooh, yeah, cheater
eyes are the worst.

412
00:18:58,838 --> 00:19:00,432
But it's not like you
deserve it, right?

413
00:19:00,456 --> 00:19:03,407
I mean, you and Jackson, it's
not the same thing. I mean, is it?

414
00:19:04,427 --> 00:19:05,843
Well, I...

415
00:19:05,912 --> 00:19:08,112
Hey, Renee called. The
carpet's gonna be done by 3:00,

416
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,597
and then we have an
appointment with the notary at 5:00.

417
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:12,900
You guys are signing
papers on the house today?

418
00:19:12,969 --> 00:19:14,296
That is so great!
Well, maybe not.

419
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,131
There's no way I can be
out of here before 5:00.

420
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:17,599
No, it's fine. He's
a traveling notary.

421
00:19:17,623 --> 00:19:19,473
He can come to us. Splendid.

422
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:20,686
And I have this ice-cream maker

423
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:21,786
I couldn't figure
out how send back.

424
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:23,154
That'll be your
housewarming gift!

425
00:19:23,178 --> 00:19:25,095
Congratulations!

426
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,524
I told you we should've
kept track of the cards.

427
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:30,145
What happened? Did you
get the dirt on her and Avery?

428
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,464
I've been trying to get Ben
to do recon with the residents,

429
00:19:32,488 --> 00:19:34,299
but he's all, "I don't
like to gossip." What?

430
00:19:34,323 --> 00:19:36,285
Dr. Torres, Robert Fischer's
missing from his room,

431
00:19:36,309 --> 00:19:38,192
and nobody knows where he is.

432
00:19:38,261 --> 00:19:39,643
The Cat Man! The cat got out.

433
00:19:41,581 --> 00:19:43,308
Dr. Ross, how about a
little lunch with the big dogs?

434
00:19:43,332 --> 00:19:44,865
Dr. Hunt wants
me to triple-check

435
00:19:44,934 --> 00:19:46,545
all of Penny's labs before
we take her to surgery.

436
00:19:46,569 --> 00:19:48,647
Well, we're not taking
her into surgery for a while.

437
00:19:48,671 --> 00:19:51,111
You have time to sit down.

438
00:19:54,877 --> 00:19:58,813
Besides, Dr. Warren could
use some friends his own age.

439
00:19:58,881 --> 00:20:01,098
How old do you think I am?

440
00:20:01,167 --> 00:20:02,483
Is that a dinosaur?

441
00:20:05,788 --> 00:20:07,532
"Have a wonderful
day, my special boy.

442
00:20:07,556 --> 00:20:09,857
"Don't forget to
wash your hands."

443
00:20:09,926 --> 00:20:12,843
I obviously have
Tuck's lunch by mistake.

444
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:17,611
Yeah, I'm getting a burger.

445
00:20:19,935 --> 00:20:21,435
It's Chief Hunt.

446
00:20:21,504 --> 00:20:24,070
I really need to get those
labs. I'll see you in surgery.

447
00:20:36,452 --> 00:20:40,471
I'm sorry, kid. I just
want to say I'm sorry.

448
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:42,089
This is all my fault.

449
00:20:43,292 --> 00:20:44,792
So get better, okay?

450
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:48,512
Just... Just get better.

451
00:20:50,533 --> 00:20:52,133
Uh-oh.

452
00:20:53,369 --> 00:20:55,186
Hey! Hey! What are
you doing in here?

453
00:20:57,507 --> 00:20:58,672
I'm sorry!

454
00:21:06,449 --> 00:21:09,249
It happened before
Kepner's wedding, didn't it?

455
00:21:09,318 --> 00:21:11,552
You said all that
stuff about being

456
00:21:11,621 --> 00:21:13,837
together forever
and having a family.

457
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:15,789
That was you proposing.

458
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:17,419
Are you serious right now?

459
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:20,444
What do you think it was?

460
00:21:20,513 --> 00:21:22,624
I thought that you were
upset about your dad.

461
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:24,926
Proposals usually end
in "Will you marry me?"

462
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,462
If I'd understood, I
never would have said...

463
00:21:26,486 --> 00:21:28,035
Well, great.

464
00:21:28,104 --> 00:21:29,547
Naomi's walking out on Jimmy,
and now you're walking out on me.

465
00:21:29,571 --> 00:21:31,049
It's freakin' kismet.
Listen to me!

466
00:21:31,073 --> 00:21:32,834
I'm not walking out on you.

467
00:21:32,858 --> 00:21:35,487
But we can't get married just because
you're screwed up about your dad.

468
00:21:35,511 --> 00:21:37,477
Don't use him as an
excuse for cold feet.

469
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:39,207
If you don't want to
get married, just say so.

470
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:42,449
I don't! I'm not ready. Okay?

471
00:21:42,517 --> 00:21:43,829
But that's not the point.
This isn't about love.

472
00:21:43,853 --> 00:21:45,869
This is about grief...
I'm not grieving!

473
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:48,088
Alex!

474
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:50,224
Damn it!

475
00:21:56,498 --> 00:21:58,527
Well, your sister's drug
problem's under control.

476
00:21:58,551 --> 00:22:00,329
She's sober, still
going to meetings.

477
00:22:00,353 --> 00:22:01,730
She is? Yeah.

478
00:22:01,754 --> 00:22:03,154
She doesn't concern us.

479
00:22:03,222 --> 00:22:05,939
Hiring undocumented workers,
now, that'll get you the boot.

480
00:22:06,008 --> 00:22:07,692
That and outstanding debt,

481
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:11,411
but you're good there.
No student loans, even.

482
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:14,680
Dr. Shepherd, what can you
tell us about Michael Boetcher?

483
00:22:16,769 --> 00:22:18,769
Michael Boetcher.

484
00:22:19,872 --> 00:22:21,438
Is Michael...

485
00:22:22,975 --> 00:22:25,576
Is he relevant to this?

486
00:22:25,644 --> 00:22:27,489
Let's start with why you've
been sending his mother

487
00:22:27,513 --> 00:22:29,663
$3,500 every month.

488
00:22:38,057 --> 00:22:41,274
You're here. Are they?

489
00:22:41,343 --> 00:22:42,926
No, they're not here.

490
00:22:42,995 --> 00:22:47,931
I'm afraid if I told you
how much it means to me

491
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,834
that you got them
to come on a plane,

492
00:22:50,903 --> 00:22:55,205
you might call them
and tell them to forget it.

493
00:22:55,274 --> 00:22:56,373
Take it easy.

494
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:03,714
I still don't know how you
managed to convince them to come.

495
00:23:03,783 --> 00:23:05,482
I told them you were dead.

496
00:23:07,703 --> 00:23:09,436
Wishful thinking?

497
00:23:11,757 --> 00:23:13,924
Where's my guitar?

498
00:23:15,194 --> 00:23:17,061
I threw some of
your stuff in storage.

499
00:23:17,129 --> 00:23:18,529
Oh, Alex.

500
00:23:19,282 --> 00:23:21,782
Can you bring it back down?

501
00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:24,185
It belonged to Naomi's dad.

502
00:23:24,253 --> 00:23:25,552
I took it.

503
00:23:27,223 --> 00:23:31,692
Of all the crap I've done,
that was one of the lowest.

504
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,810
I want to give it back.

505
00:23:33,879 --> 00:23:36,113
Please.

506
00:23:36,182 --> 00:23:40,350
Make sure I'm awake
when they get here.

507
00:23:47,459 --> 00:23:49,426
Well, looks like the
bone's still intact,

508
00:23:49,495 --> 00:23:51,378
so you didn't do
too much damage.

509
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:54,014
I never should've done it.

510
00:23:54,082 --> 00:23:56,383
You think?

511
00:23:56,451 --> 00:23:59,520
I never should
have left the house.

512
00:23:59,588 --> 00:24:01,366
This whole accident happened,

513
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:03,891
all these people were
hurt because of me!

514
00:24:03,959 --> 00:24:06,593
Because of some stupid
thing I've done to myself!

515
00:24:06,662 --> 00:24:10,164
You know, when I started
this, my parents, everybody said,

516
00:24:10,232 --> 00:24:14,601
"You think you're gonna
like this in 20 years?"

517
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:19,206
I thought I would. I
thought I knew who I was.

518
00:24:20,976 --> 00:24:22,742
I was 19.

519
00:24:25,347 --> 00:24:30,184
So now I work from home,
same data-entry job for 16 years.

520
00:24:30,252 --> 00:24:32,086
I can't date.

521
00:24:32,154 --> 00:24:35,739
The kind of women who find me
attractive scare the crap out of me.

522
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:40,010
I don't have friends.
People stare, people laugh.

523
00:24:40,078 --> 00:24:41,594
People punch.

524
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:45,777
And time goes by, and I realize

525
00:24:45,801 --> 00:24:48,202
I haven't left my house
in a year and a half.

526
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:50,270
I said to myself, "Rob,
you got to do something.

527
00:24:50,339 --> 00:24:52,784
"You got to try and live again.

528
00:24:52,808 --> 00:24:56,844
"Just go out. Just
go for a walk."

529
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:59,046
That was this morning.

530
00:25:02,168 --> 00:25:04,101
We're just gonna
finish splinting this up,

531
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:06,636
make sure it's stable, okay?

532
00:25:06,705 --> 00:25:08,138
Can you make it quick?

533
00:25:09,908 --> 00:25:12,108
I just want to go home.

534
00:25:15,414 --> 00:25:17,314
Jimmy's BP's gone to crap.

535
00:25:17,382 --> 00:25:19,566
In and out of consciousness?

536
00:25:19,634 --> 00:25:24,305
Yeah. This is it, isn't
it? He's out of time.

537
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:26,290
You okay?

538
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:28,508
What? Give me a
break, Mer. Not you, too.

539
00:25:28,577 --> 00:25:30,394
You of all people
should understand.

540
00:25:33,399 --> 00:25:35,360
You think there's
anything you can do?

541
00:25:35,384 --> 00:25:38,185
He has a DNR. I don't think so.

542
00:25:38,254 --> 00:25:39,894
Let's finish up here
and go take a look.

543
00:25:39,921 --> 00:25:41,081
Okay.

544
00:25:44,143 --> 00:25:47,678
More suction. Got a
bleeder. Clamp, please.

545
00:25:47,747 --> 00:25:50,447
Hold on. Dr. Ross, take over.

546
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,337
Which blood vessel is that?

547
00:25:56,405 --> 00:26:00,040
It's a branch of the
superior mesenteric artery.

548
00:26:00,109 --> 00:26:02,242
And how are you gonna repair it?

549
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:04,361
I'm gonna throw a surgical
tie around the clamp.

550
00:26:04,429 --> 00:26:06,162
3-0 silk on a passer.

551
00:26:06,215 --> 00:26:08,666
And what does the superior
mesenteric artery supply?

552
00:26:08,734 --> 00:26:11,468
The midgut. And what is
the origin of the midgut?

553
00:26:11,537 --> 00:26:13,103
What?

554
00:26:13,172 --> 00:26:15,221
The embryology.

555
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:18,203
Dr. Hunt, I think he could probably
do the tie without the anatomy lesson...

556
00:26:18,227 --> 00:26:20,005
Dr. Webber, I think a surgeon

557
00:26:20,029 --> 00:26:22,310
should be able to demonstrate
a complete understanding

558
00:26:22,365 --> 00:26:25,665
of the part of the body
before he operates on it.

559
00:26:25,734 --> 00:26:28,001
The midgut is formed from the...

560
00:26:29,555 --> 00:26:31,138
The primary
intestinal loop and...

561
00:26:31,206 --> 00:26:32,756
And?

562
00:26:33,909 --> 00:26:34,942
I'm sorry.

563
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:37,077
And the cephalic limb develops

564
00:26:37,146 --> 00:26:39,463
into the distal duodenum,
jejunum, and ileum.

565
00:26:39,531 --> 00:26:43,183
You're about to place a
stitch into this patient's body

566
00:26:43,252 --> 00:26:46,453
and then seal her up, and you
can't tell me the basic anatomy

567
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:48,583
that you're
repairing? I'm sorry.

568
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:52,392
Do not apologize to me one more
time. You don't owe me an apology.

569
00:26:52,461 --> 00:26:54,694
You owe one to the man
whose heart you ripped apart

570
00:26:54,763 --> 00:26:56,174
because you didn't know
what you were doing,

571
00:26:56,198 --> 00:26:58,481
just like you owe an
apology to this girl,

572
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:00,818
who is laying on this
table, losing blood,

573
00:27:00,886 --> 00:27:04,521
because you don't know
how to do a basic tie.

574
00:27:05,691 --> 00:27:07,624
Leave the OR, Dr. Ross.

575
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:13,163
Dr. Warren, do the tie.

576
00:27:24,025 --> 00:27:25,175
Hi.

577
00:27:28,947 --> 00:27:30,513
Hey.

578
00:27:31,917 --> 00:27:33,550
It's really good to see you.

579
00:27:33,602 --> 00:27:35,797
You know, I've been
calling... No, I have a patient.

580
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:38,266
And he's done all these
surgeries to look like a cat,

581
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:40,635
and he doesn't want to
look like a cat anymore,

582
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:42,170
and he doesn't have any money,

583
00:27:42,194 --> 00:27:44,021
but you could fix him, pro-bono.

584
00:27:44,045 --> 00:27:46,013
Steph, I need to explain.

585
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:49,549
You telling me that you
feel guilty only helps you.

586
00:27:49,618 --> 00:27:51,435
Not me.

587
00:27:51,504 --> 00:27:55,722
If you want to do something
useful, fix the Cat Man.

588
00:28:09,421 --> 00:28:11,020
Dr. Karev?

589
00:28:13,492 --> 00:28:16,009
Walk away, Ross.

590
00:28:16,078 --> 00:28:18,395
Dr. Karev, I owe you an apology.

591
00:28:20,099 --> 00:28:21,631
I owe you both...

592
00:28:24,236 --> 00:28:25,897
What the hell? Wait! Alex, stop!

593
00:28:25,921 --> 00:28:27,554
Alex! Alex! Alex! Alex!

594
00:28:27,623 --> 00:28:29,840
Alex! Get off!

595
00:28:29,909 --> 00:28:31,625
Ross, get up, get up!

596
00:28:31,694 --> 00:28:33,493
Stop it! Stop it! Go!

597
00:28:33,562 --> 00:28:34,806
Stop it! What is going on?

598
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:36,230
Let's go! Come on!

599
00:28:38,267 --> 00:28:42,436
Alex, please. Please.

600
00:28:56,568 --> 00:29:01,471
I thought if I came back,
kept my head down,

601
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:04,741
did the work, I
might be able to...

602
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:06,443
Not fix it,

603
00:29:06,512 --> 00:29:09,846
but start to make up for
what I did to Karev's dad.

604
00:29:14,219 --> 00:29:15,902
I don't deserve to feel better.

605
00:29:16,572 --> 00:29:17,987
I deserved this.

606
00:29:18,056 --> 00:29:20,123
Yeah. You really did.

607
00:29:27,716 --> 00:29:32,486
Baby Nathan's mom sent me this.

608
00:29:32,554 --> 00:29:34,666
It's one of those
annoying pictures

609
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:37,235
all mothers think are cute of
their baby with food all over its face.

610
00:29:37,259 --> 00:29:41,428
Except this one, it's not cute.

611
00:29:43,098 --> 00:29:46,683
It's miraculous. Revolutionary.

612
00:29:48,053 --> 00:29:50,754
You saved a baby, Shane,

613
00:29:50,823 --> 00:29:53,673
because you had the
idea to 3-D print the conduit

614
00:29:53,742 --> 00:29:56,593
and wouldn't stop
pushing until I came around.

615
00:29:56,662 --> 00:29:59,763
You made some bad choices,

616
00:30:01,233 --> 00:30:04,067
but that was a good one.

617
00:30:04,136 --> 00:30:07,137
Moving forward,
make more good ones.

618
00:30:09,157 --> 00:30:11,608
Everywhere you see a
red tag, sign your name.

619
00:30:11,676 --> 00:30:12,843
Okay.

620
00:30:14,213 --> 00:30:16,396
Um...

621
00:30:17,199 --> 00:30:18,465
I know you're excited.

622
00:30:18,534 --> 00:30:21,067
You've been smiling
since we found the house,

623
00:30:21,136 --> 00:30:23,386
and I have missed
that smile so much.

624
00:30:23,455 --> 00:30:27,024
But three weeks ago, you were
convinced we weren't gonna last.

625
00:30:27,092 --> 00:30:29,120
I'm worried that you're thinking
about how good it feels now

626
00:30:29,144 --> 00:30:33,863
and not thinking about the
fact that I come with the house.

627
00:30:33,932 --> 00:30:36,411
You know why I smile when
I think about that house?

628
00:30:36,435 --> 00:30:37,435
Hmm?

629
00:30:38,804 --> 00:30:40,304
I look at that house

630
00:30:40,372 --> 00:30:43,940
and I don't see a hospital
bed in our bedroom,

631
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:46,654
and I don't see a shower
that you had to drag me into

632
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:49,079
because I wouldn't
do it on my own.

633
00:30:49,147 --> 00:30:55,535
I see a tire swing
and a tree house.

634
00:30:55,604 --> 00:31:00,173
We may wake up in a year and
realize it was a huge mistake.

635
00:31:01,676 --> 00:31:06,947
But if it works... Oh, my God.

636
00:31:07,015 --> 00:31:10,450
Just thinking about it makes
me smile so hard my face hurts.

637
00:31:16,791 --> 00:31:18,553
Kissing the bride isn't enough.

638
00:31:18,577 --> 00:31:20,655
You have to actually
sign the papers.

639
00:31:20,679 --> 00:31:21,794
Aah!

640
00:31:29,421 --> 00:31:31,855
What happened? Are you okay?

641
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:36,660
It's my fault.

642
00:31:38,096 --> 00:31:41,297
I knew I shouldn't
get involved with him.

643
00:31:42,768 --> 00:31:45,936
I knew it was a mistake,
and I did it anyway.

644
00:31:50,675 --> 00:31:54,044
It's too hard being
here around him.

645
00:31:59,651 --> 00:32:01,451
I should leave.

646
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:04,955
I could transfer.

647
00:32:05,023 --> 00:32:07,490
Leaving's not the answer.

648
00:32:11,463 --> 00:32:14,865
He took advantage here, not you.

649
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:16,099
He's your boss,

650
00:32:16,168 --> 00:32:18,168
and he chose to
start dating you.

651
00:32:18,237 --> 00:32:20,137
And then he chose
to humiliate you

652
00:32:20,205 --> 00:32:22,105
in front of all of
your co-workers.

653
00:32:22,174 --> 00:32:24,874
He did that. They all do it.

654
00:32:24,944 --> 00:32:28,812
Arizona did it to me, and
Yang did a number on Shane.

655
00:32:28,881 --> 00:32:33,116
They are our bosses, and
we're expendable to them.

656
00:32:35,437 --> 00:32:37,236
But we shouldn't be.

657
00:32:39,408 --> 00:32:41,841
You could do something about it.

658
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:44,277
You should do
something about it.

659
00:32:46,815 --> 00:32:48,715
That was vicious.

660
00:32:48,783 --> 00:32:51,451
He was drowning in there,
and you were enjoying it.

661
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:53,336
Well, I'm sorry my
style of leadership

662
00:32:53,404 --> 00:32:55,138
doesn't involve
taking Ross to lunch.

663
00:32:55,207 --> 00:32:57,647
Tell me this isn't about
who he was sleeping with.

664
00:33:00,095 --> 00:33:02,957
You really think I would let that
interfere with the way that I do my job?

665
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:05,531
I wouldn't have
thought it before today.

666
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,802
Chief Hunt, there's someone
from HR looking for you.

667
00:33:09,604 --> 00:33:11,538
I'll be right there.

668
00:33:20,532 --> 00:33:21,681
Alex?

669
00:33:28,974 --> 00:33:31,141
Naomi and Nicky
are on their way.

670
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:33,143
They're coming?

671
00:33:33,211 --> 00:33:35,278
They're on their way.

672
00:33:37,198 --> 00:33:39,015
When?

673
00:33:40,719 --> 00:33:44,987
Their plane was delayed. I
told them about the guitar.

674
00:33:45,974 --> 00:33:47,840
They're coming?

675
00:33:47,909 --> 00:33:49,493
They're coming.

676
00:33:51,129 --> 00:33:54,631
I, uh, told them about
the guitar. I told them...

677
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,599
I told them that you love them.

678
00:33:58,003 --> 00:34:00,503
You told them?

679
00:34:00,572 --> 00:34:02,105
I told them.

680
00:34:03,408 --> 00:34:05,708
They know you love
them. They know.

681
00:34:07,312 --> 00:34:10,713
It's okay. It's okay, Jimmy.

682
00:34:10,782 --> 00:34:13,399
It's okay. They
know you love them.

683
00:34:13,469 --> 00:34:15,335
They know.

684
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,556
You can go.

685
00:34:22,644 --> 00:34:24,394
They know. You can go.

686
00:35:00,615 --> 00:35:03,416
You son of a bitch.

687
00:35:14,646 --> 00:35:16,196
Hey, hey.

688
00:35:16,264 --> 00:35:19,348
Uh, did you get anything out of
Edwards about Avery or Kepner?

689
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:21,577
Hello, honey. How was your day?

690
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,219
Come on.

691
00:35:23,288 --> 00:35:26,306
A resident went off the
rails and nearly killed a man.

692
00:35:26,375 --> 00:35:27,824
I didn't see that coming.

693
00:35:27,892 --> 00:35:31,377
People are buying houses
and running out on marriages.

694
00:35:31,446 --> 00:35:33,040
Things are topsy-turvy
all over the place,

695
00:35:33,064 --> 00:35:34,831
and I don't understand
any of it, so spill.

696
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,265
There's nothing to spill!

697
00:35:36,334 --> 00:35:38,045
And even if there
was, I wouldn't tell you,

698
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:40,064
because I need these
kids to trust me. Oh!

699
00:35:40,088 --> 00:35:42,099
And the only reason why
there's a spot for me to fill

700
00:35:42,123 --> 00:35:44,524
is because one of
their friends died.

701
00:35:44,593 --> 00:35:47,193
I have my work cut
out for me as it is.

702
00:35:47,262 --> 00:35:48,695
Fine.

703
00:35:53,385 --> 00:35:54,865
You had pizza for
lunch, didn't you?

704
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,319
No.

705
00:35:56,387 --> 00:35:58,822
Okay, you don't have to
gossip with me, Ben Warren,

706
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:00,957
but you'd better
not start lying to me.

707
00:36:03,295 --> 00:36:06,462
It was a burger. Ha!
The plot thickens.

708
00:36:21,830 --> 00:36:24,280
They found something.

709
00:36:24,349 --> 00:36:25,815
I played hockey in high school.

710
00:36:25,884 --> 00:36:28,200
I have a lot of slides to
get through here, Derek.

711
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:31,070
There was this kid,
Michael Boetcher.

712
00:36:31,139 --> 00:36:33,339
He and I were the most
aggressive guys on the team,

713
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:35,941
and one day at practice, I
cross-checked him into the boards.

714
00:36:36,010 --> 00:36:41,231
We both went down, both got
back up, we continued to play.

715
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:43,466
Boetcher didn't come
back to school the next day.

716
00:36:43,535 --> 00:36:45,801
He had a brain bleed that night.

717
00:36:45,871 --> 00:36:47,781
He died? It was worse than that.

718
00:36:47,805 --> 00:36:50,707
It was a pontine bleed,
so he couldn't move,

719
00:36:50,775 --> 00:36:52,842
couldn't communicate.
All he could do was blink.

720
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:56,028
So the President's people
found out about this, or...

721
00:36:56,097 --> 00:36:59,332
He's been in long-term
care ever since.

722
00:37:01,035 --> 00:37:04,136
I send his family money.
They wondered why.

723
00:37:04,205 --> 00:37:07,317
So your deep, dark secret is
that you've spent the last 30 years

724
00:37:07,341 --> 00:37:09,303
paying for an accident that
happened when you were a teenager?

725
00:37:09,327 --> 00:37:10,710
Because I put him there.

726
00:37:10,795 --> 00:37:13,290
And then you became a
neurosurgeon, like a superhero.

727
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:15,292
And now, the President
of the United States

728
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:18,345
has handpicked you to carve
out the future of medicine.

729
00:37:18,369 --> 00:37:21,249
I have no room to be angry
here, but this is infuriating!

730
00:37:21,273 --> 00:37:22,717
Well, if I could turn
it down, I would.

731
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:24,168
You know what would help me?

732
00:37:24,192 --> 00:37:26,437
If you would just stop talking
about your duty to God and country

733
00:37:26,461 --> 00:37:28,089
and just admit that
you want to do this.

734
00:37:28,113 --> 00:37:30,497
I do. Of course I do. Yes.

735
00:37:30,565 --> 00:37:32,109
Yeah, see, somehow, I
thought that was gonna help me,

736
00:37:32,133 --> 00:37:34,211
but it only made me angrier!

737
00:37:36,938 --> 00:37:38,070
Hello?

738
00:37:39,374 --> 00:37:41,402
Uh, no, Dr. Shepherd cannot
come to the phone right now

739
00:37:41,426 --> 00:37:43,037
because he is
fighting with his wife.

740
00:37:43,061 --> 00:37:44,572
Who is it? It's the White House.

741
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:46,107
Give me the phone!
Give me the phone.

742
00:37:46,131 --> 00:37:48,131
It's Owen. Do
you think I'm nuts?

743
00:37:49,551 --> 00:37:51,551
They're calling an
emergency board meeting.

744
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:10,737
Is this about what happened
with Karev and Ross?

745
00:38:10,805 --> 00:38:12,200
What happened
with Karev and Ross?

746
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:13,789
Nothing.

747
00:38:13,858 --> 00:38:15,298
One of our surgical residents

748
00:38:15,343 --> 00:38:18,144
has lodged an official
complaint with Human Resources.

749
00:38:18,213 --> 00:38:19,691
Three separate
complaints, actually.

750
00:38:19,715 --> 00:38:22,999
Directed sexual harassment,
quid-pro-quo harassment,

751
00:38:23,067 --> 00:38:24,934
and hostile work environment.

752
00:38:25,003 --> 00:38:27,153
What? Who? Directed at whom?

753
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:30,873
HR won't release that or
the name of the resident.

754
00:38:30,942 --> 00:38:32,753
"Hostile work
environment"? Come on.

755
00:38:32,777 --> 00:38:34,121
Does she have a case legally?

756
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:36,613
Okay. Is there
way that we could...

757
00:38:36,681 --> 00:38:40,016
Or maybe I could
talk to this person?

758
00:38:40,084 --> 00:38:41,395
You know, we could
just clear the air

759
00:38:41,419 --> 00:38:42,663
before it gets
out of proportion.

760
00:38:42,687 --> 00:38:43,831
He shouldn't talk to
her without legal present.

761
00:38:43,855 --> 00:38:45,032
Well, if she's
filed a complaint...

762
00:38:45,056 --> 00:38:46,005
You're all missing the point!

763
00:38:46,074 --> 00:38:47,952
This is not about one person.

764
00:38:47,976 --> 00:38:52,078
This is a complaint about this
hospital and this teaching program.

765
00:38:52,147 --> 00:38:56,716
We are too often letting our
personal lives disrupt our work.

766
00:38:56,785 --> 00:38:59,151
None of us are guilt-free...

767
00:39:00,354 --> 00:39:01,988
Myself included.

768
00:39:02,057 --> 00:39:09,412
Now, HR have recommended
a clear, zero-tolerance policy.

769
00:39:09,481 --> 00:39:11,721
"Excluding those of
pre-existing married couples..."

770
00:39:11,783 --> 00:39:14,033
"Relationships of
romantic or sexual nature

771
00:39:14,102 --> 00:39:17,737
"between superiors and
subordinates will not be allowed."

772
00:39:17,805 --> 00:39:20,256
It is restrictive, it
is non-negotiable,

773
00:39:20,325 --> 00:39:24,460
but it is fair and, better
still, it is unambiguous.

774
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:28,014
I urge you all to vote
to implement this.

775
00:39:28,083 --> 00:39:30,282
<i>Looking back, it's easy</i>

776
00:39:30,351 --> 00:39:32,485
<i>to see when a mistake
has been made.</i>

777
00:40:01,916 --> 00:40:05,251
<i>To regret a choice that seemed
like a decent idea at the time.</i>

778
00:40:08,389 --> 00:40:10,123
Hope you're okay with spaghetti.

779
00:40:10,191 --> 00:40:11,891
I had to ditch that
leftover chicken.

780
00:40:16,381 --> 00:40:18,314
I found a home for
the ice-cream maker.

781
00:40:18,383 --> 00:40:20,010
I thought we were keeping it.

782
00:40:20,034 --> 00:40:22,246
Hope we didn't go
through all that for nothing.

783
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:23,469
Hey!

784
00:40:26,875 --> 00:40:28,541
Mmm.

785
00:40:28,609 --> 00:40:30,609
We had a board meeting tonight.

786
00:40:30,679 --> 00:40:33,813
I don't think we're gonna be able
to keep this a secret much longer.

787
00:40:33,882 --> 00:40:35,181
A meeting about us?

788
00:40:35,249 --> 00:40:36,482
Kind of.

789
00:40:37,418 --> 00:40:39,669
What happened?

790
00:40:39,737 --> 00:40:41,721
I'll tell you about
it after dinner.

791
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:51,797
April, get back in the car!

792
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:52,998
You can't just walk back!

793
00:40:53,068 --> 00:40:54,133
Why?

794
00:40:54,202 --> 00:40:55,667
Bears?

795
00:40:55,736 --> 00:40:58,933
Matthew doesn't deserve
this! And Stephanie?

796
00:40:58,957 --> 00:41:00,484
What are we supposed
to say to them?

797
00:41:00,508 --> 00:41:02,742
My parents? Your mother?

798
00:41:02,810 --> 00:41:04,677
Oh, my God. My mother...

799
00:41:04,746 --> 00:41:07,547
How do we explain
that we just destroyed

800
00:41:07,615 --> 00:41:11,701
two perfectly lovely people
so that we could, what, date?

801
00:41:11,753 --> 00:41:16,105
Okay, the best solution is never
to speak to any of them ever again.

802
00:41:17,041 --> 00:41:18,274
Or...

803
00:41:18,343 --> 00:41:20,043
Or we get married. I...

804
00:41:20,094 --> 00:41:22,712
Because that's
easier to explain.

805
00:41:22,781 --> 00:41:25,815
No. No, 'cause
you're right, all right?

806
00:41:25,883 --> 00:41:27,550
I don't want to just date.

807
00:41:27,619 --> 00:41:30,235
April, I want the
whole damn thing.

808
00:41:30,304 --> 00:41:32,155
We can get to Lake
Tahoe in 13 hours.

809
00:41:33,458 --> 00:41:34,773
How do you know that?

810
00:41:34,842 --> 00:41:37,555
Do you want to get
into that right now? No.

811
00:41:37,579 --> 00:41:39,612
No, you don't
want to get into that,

812
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:42,014
or, no, you don't
want to get married?

813
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:46,318
<i>But if we used our best judgment
and listened to our hearts,</i>

814
00:41:46,387 --> 00:41:49,438
<i>we're more likely to
see that we chose wisely.</i>

815
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:51,074
Yes.

816
00:41:52,177 --> 00:41:53,493
Yes!

817
00:41:55,279 --> 00:41:59,882
<i>And avoided the deepest,
most painful regret of them all,</i>

818
00:41:59,951 --> 00:42:04,504
<i>the regret that comes from letting
something amazing pass you by.</i>
