1
00:00:26,977 --> 00:00:30,039
You don't have
to leave. It's okay.

2
00:00:30,063 --> 00:00:32,747
Well, do you want
some breakfast?

3
00:00:32,816 --> 00:00:34,983
You don't have to do this.

4
00:00:35,051 --> 00:00:36,729
I'm sorry. I know
I'm not supposed

5
00:00:36,753 --> 00:00:38,620
to sleep over. I
was just so tired.

6
00:00:38,689 --> 00:00:40,734
I thought I was gonna
close my eyes for a second.

7
00:00:40,758 --> 00:00:42,307
It's okay.

8
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:44,609
It's not. I totally
agree with you.

9
00:00:44,678 --> 00:00:48,513
This is casual. It's not about
snuggling in the morning.

10
00:00:48,582 --> 00:00:52,517
It's easy. That's me. Easy
peasy lemon squeezy.

11
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:59,591
Leah, I was gonna order some
food, so if you want some...

12
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:02,060
I'm fine. I gotta
go find a costume

13
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:05,380
for this thing at
Joe's tonight, so...

14
00:01:05,448 --> 00:01:06,559
That's right. It's Halloween.

15
00:01:06,583 --> 00:01:08,743
Happy...

16
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:12,716
<i>Every Halloween,
we make a choice</i>

17
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:15,440
<i>about what kind of
costume we're going to wear.</i>

18
00:01:16,393 --> 00:01:17,960
<i>Something sexy...</i>

19
00:01:18,028 --> 00:01:19,339
Morning. Oh, good.
Can you take these?

20
00:01:19,363 --> 00:01:20,557
There's a rip in
the bottom left.

21
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:22,175
Oh. I just finished an APPY,

22
00:01:22,199 --> 00:01:23,810
and I was going to
do it in the 20 minutes

23
00:01:23,834 --> 00:01:25,400
before my lap chole...

24
00:01:25,468 --> 00:01:26,579
Mmm-hmm. But I
need to get on the phone

25
00:01:26,603 --> 00:01:27,903
and order a 3D printer.

26
00:01:27,971 --> 00:01:29,683
Your grant got
approved? That's great.

27
00:01:29,707 --> 00:01:32,574
Yeah, it is, except it's a conflict
with a butterfly wing repair.

28
00:01:32,642 --> 00:01:34,487
Well, I need to solve
my array problem today.

29
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:36,473
If I can figure out how
to shrink the craniotomy,

30
00:01:36,497 --> 00:01:38,541
I should be able to avoid a lot of
the infections that we're getting.

31
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:40,210
Okay, well, this will only
take you four minutes.

32
00:01:40,234 --> 00:01:41,644
I know. I'm just telling
you about my day.

33
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:43,213
Oh, well, I did not factor
that into the schedule.

34
00:01:43,237 --> 00:01:44,614
And trick-or-treating
still on tonight?

35
00:01:44,638 --> 00:01:46,037
Uh, of course, of course.

36
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:47,451
<i>Maybe we'll be someone scary...</i>

37
00:01:47,475 --> 00:01:49,870
Alex, did you get the
house ready? Yep.

38
00:01:49,894 --> 00:01:51,910
Okay. Candy? No.

39
00:01:51,979 --> 00:01:53,673
Did you get the pumpkins? No.

40
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:55,709
Did you put up the
spider webs? No.

41
00:01:55,733 --> 00:01:58,517
Then how is the house
ready? I got the keg.

42
00:01:58,586 --> 00:02:00,186
Oh, you're having a
party at the house?

43
00:02:00,821 --> 00:02:02,788
Um...

44
00:02:02,857 --> 00:02:04,400
Yeah. Alex is letting us use
the house to trick-or-treat from,

45
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:06,035
because we have no
neighbors where we are,

46
00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:08,989
so I invited a bunch of
families from the daycare.

47
00:02:09,013 --> 00:02:10,557
He didn't tell you? No.

48
00:02:10,581 --> 00:02:12,063
Oh, you should come.

49
00:02:12,133 --> 00:02:14,132
It's fine.

50
00:02:14,201 --> 00:02:16,078
Right. Well, you don't wanna
be around a bunch of kids

51
00:02:16,102 --> 00:02:18,181
hopped-up on sugar
anyway, right? Right.

52
00:02:18,205 --> 00:02:20,066
'Cause I hate
children. Cristina.

53
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:23,458
But I love your kids.

54
00:02:23,527 --> 00:02:25,927
I should have invited you.
I'm sorry. I just thought...

55
00:02:25,962 --> 00:02:29,108
But you should come
for a drink. It's at 7:00.

56
00:02:29,132 --> 00:02:31,292
She's gonna be a butterfly.

57
00:02:31,435 --> 00:02:34,335
I have to go. I
have a lap chole.

58
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:38,874
<i>Or you could be a superhero,
which is what I'm trying to be this year.</i>

59
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:43,161
How many fingers?

60
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,863
Three. Hangnail
on the index finger.

61
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:47,043
No side effects?

62
00:02:47,067 --> 00:02:49,033
My uncle had LASIK,
like, three years ago.

63
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:50,529
He still has
horrible facial pain

64
00:02:50,553 --> 00:02:52,015
and he's basically
addicted to painkillers.

65
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:54,500
Leah. Well, your uncle probably
came back to work too early

66
00:02:54,524 --> 00:02:57,244
and didn't take the two days
off that the doctor recommended.

67
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:58,421
I am a second-year resident.

68
00:02:58,445 --> 00:03:00,473
Sixteen hours is already more

69
00:03:00,497 --> 00:03:02,275
recovery time than I can afford.

70
00:03:02,299 --> 00:03:03,832
Go work. Leave me alone.

71
00:03:03,901 --> 00:03:05,133
Bye.

72
00:03:11,407 --> 00:03:12,569
How's it going with Alex?

73
00:03:12,593 --> 00:03:13,759
Radio silence.

74
00:03:13,827 --> 00:03:15,927
Still? I think it's over.

75
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:19,464
Well, I don't believe that,
and I have extraordinary vision.

76
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:21,294
Literally and figuratively.

77
00:03:21,318 --> 00:03:23,668
Come on. Time to
go round on Webber.

78
00:03:23,737 --> 00:03:26,304
Ow!

79
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:29,819
Are you sure you
don't want to go home?

80
00:03:31,028 --> 00:03:33,678
Okay.

81
00:03:33,747 --> 00:03:35,859
Hey, kids. You got Halloween plans?
- I'll take it.

82
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:38,210
Yeah, Matthew's having a
thing. I'm going as a bunny.

83
00:03:38,234 --> 00:03:40,502
Ooh. Playboy? Uh, Velveteen.

84
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:41,903
Needs work.

85
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:43,983
How about you, Lone Ranger?
Are you and Emma going out?

86
00:03:44,007 --> 00:03:46,708
Uh, Emma and I
are no longer a thing.

87
00:03:46,777 --> 00:03:48,326
What? Why?

88
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:50,435
Well, it's just too
soon. I'm not ready.

89
00:03:51,181 --> 00:03:52,181
Yes, you are.

90
00:03:52,266 --> 00:03:53,632
Emma doesn't think so,

91
00:03:53,684 --> 00:03:55,945
because I never mentioned
being married before.

92
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:58,048
She said, "Call me
when you're ready."

93
00:03:58,072 --> 00:04:00,055
You're ready. Don't
you think he's ready?

94
00:04:00,124 --> 00:04:02,204
Well, maybe he's ready,
but he's not ready to call.

95
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,559
What's the difference?
He's ready. You should...

96
00:04:05,262 --> 00:04:06,962
Hmm.

97
00:04:07,031 --> 00:04:09,815
He's not ready. Not ready.

98
00:04:09,883 --> 00:04:13,134
Hey, um, I have the costume in my
car. What time do you wanna meet?

99
00:04:13,203 --> 00:04:14,903
No, I have the costume.

100
00:04:14,972 --> 00:04:16,349
Oh, please, don't tell me we
have two astronaut costumes.

101
00:04:16,373 --> 00:04:17,939
We don't. We have a princess.

102
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:19,908
What? Yeah.

103
00:04:19,977 --> 00:04:21,855
That's what you... You want
her to strive to be a princess?

104
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:24,245
No, it's what she wants.
It's what she asked for.

105
00:04:24,314 --> 00:04:25,975
No, no, no. She told me she
wanted to be an astronaut,

106
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:27,961
and that's why I spent
three hours last night

107
00:04:27,985 --> 00:04:29,979
sewing patches on
a little, tiny flight suit.

108
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:32,081
Yeah, well, I spent the
night gluing daisies on a tutu.

109
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,717
Fine. We can hold
up the costumes,

110
00:04:33,741 --> 00:04:35,802
and she can decide
whose work she loves more.

111
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,061
You know what?
Forget it. You take her.

112
00:04:39,146 --> 00:04:40,979
I'm not doing this.

113
00:04:42,283 --> 00:04:43,560
- Are you serious?
- As the grave.

114
00:04:43,584 --> 00:04:45,016
That is amazing.

115
00:04:45,085 --> 00:04:46,451
What's amazing?

116
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,614
Dr. Webber wants one of
us to do his surgery today.

117
00:04:48,638 --> 00:04:49,838
Oh...

118
00:04:49,906 --> 00:04:51,356
Not you. No offense,

119
00:04:51,425 --> 00:04:53,436
but I heard you walked
into a wall this morning.

120
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,693
Uh, why not me?

121
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:56,072
Well, you can supervise.

122
00:04:56,096 --> 00:04:57,239
They know this
procedure inside out.

123
00:04:57,263 --> 00:04:59,548
They're ready. I beg to differ.

124
00:04:59,616 --> 00:05:02,683
How do you do a
transgastric approach?

125
00:05:02,752 --> 00:05:05,670
Anterior gastrotomy for access
and cystogastrostomy creation

126
00:05:05,723 --> 00:05:06,900
through the posterior wall.

127
00:05:06,924 --> 00:05:08,534
What about the
posterior approach?

128
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:11,158
That is a single gastrotomy in
continuity with the pseudocyst.

129
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:13,828
Very nice, and which
is the easiest approach?

130
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:15,458
It'd have to be the
intraluminal approach.

131
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:17,648
Unless you're a fan of
intraoperative bleeding,

132
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:19,311
in which case, do what you like.

133
00:05:19,335 --> 00:05:21,280
I thought I wasn't seeing
you until the weekend.

134
00:05:21,304 --> 00:05:23,254
Ah, I couldn't miss
trick-or-treating.

135
00:05:23,324 --> 00:05:24,705
Just didn't seem right.

136
00:05:24,775 --> 00:05:26,091
Good man.

137
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,037
That's a bold move,
letting the second years

138
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:30,690
try a procedure like this on
you. How you gonna pick?

139
00:05:30,714 --> 00:05:32,892
Bailey, watch them
in the ER today.

140
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:33,960
Tell me which one deserves it.

141
00:05:33,984 --> 00:05:35,061
None of them do.

142
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:36,745
And I don't need to
spend a day in the ER.

143
00:05:36,769 --> 00:05:38,486
Dr. Bailey, that's all.

144
00:05:38,555 --> 00:05:42,524
Get out of here. We're gonna
review an intraluminal approach.

145
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:43,952
Come on.

146
00:05:46,413 --> 00:05:49,113
Okay, so, you, me, and Tuck.

147
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:51,060
We should think of costumes
that have three parts,

148
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:52,483
like the Three Stooges.

149
00:05:52,553 --> 00:05:54,947
I have a witch's hat. I put it
on every year and call it a day.

150
00:05:54,971 --> 00:05:56,733
And my day is gonna be about

151
00:05:56,757 --> 00:05:59,357
which of those three residents

152
00:05:59,426 --> 00:06:02,088
is gonna kill the most
important patient I've ever had.

153
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:06,097
Halloween was kind
of my family's thing,

154
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:09,834
and I want it to be our
family's thing, so go work.

155
00:06:09,903 --> 00:06:11,436
I'll figure it out.

156
00:06:11,505 --> 00:06:14,289
You just come at the end
of the day with that face

157
00:06:14,358 --> 00:06:17,174
and that body and the...

158
00:06:18,395 --> 00:06:20,528
I'll figure out
what to put on it.

159
00:06:22,515 --> 00:06:25,483
It's a holiday for
children, you know.

160
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:28,792
Victor Brown, 30-year-old male
mauling victim. Vitals are stable.

161
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:30,550
Let's get him to Trauma.
What mauled him?

162
00:06:30,574 --> 00:06:32,824
He just attacked me.
He came out of nowhere.

163
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:33,953
Wait. Who is "he"? The guy.

164
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:35,571
He was snarling and growling.

165
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:37,107
I'm sorry. A person
did this to you?

166
00:06:37,131 --> 00:06:39,614
He started eating my
face, like some sort of...

167
00:06:39,683 --> 00:06:40,760
Watch your back.

168
00:06:40,784 --> 00:06:42,049
Zombie?

169
00:06:42,118 --> 00:06:43,334
Murphy? Edwards?

170
00:06:43,404 --> 00:06:45,214
It's the biter. Multiple
GSW's to the chest.

171
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:47,372
BP 90 over 60.

172
00:06:47,441 --> 00:06:48,951
Pulse in the 120s.
He's on something.

173
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:51,320
How is this guy stable? He's
got two bullet holes over his heart.

174
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:53,790
Cops shot him before he ate
that other guy's whole face off.

175
00:06:53,814 --> 00:06:54,957
And he had four lorazepam.

176
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:57,248
Barely slowed him down.

177
00:06:57,317 --> 00:06:58,461
I want him sedated now.

178
00:06:58,485 --> 00:07:00,351
Push two of lorazepam
and five of Haldol.

179
00:07:02,272 --> 00:07:04,992
This guy should not be alive.
Guys, I can barely hear his heart.

180
00:07:18,505 --> 00:07:19,737
Ow!

181
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:22,173
Sorry. It's pretty deep.
Just patch me up.

182
00:07:22,242 --> 00:07:24,087
There's no way I'm missing
out on Webber's surgery

183
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:26,089
because of a little neck
lac. Oh, yes, you are.

184
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:27,612
God!

185
00:07:27,681 --> 00:07:29,330
Where did you come from?

186
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:33,267
I'm everywhere, and you are not
going into an OR with an open wound.

187
00:07:33,336 --> 00:07:36,104
You need to get yourself tested
and run an infectious panel,

188
00:07:36,173 --> 00:07:41,092
including rapid HIV on him, and
whoever's blood was in his mouth.

189
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,328
Hold up.

190
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:44,396
Ow!

191
00:07:47,517 --> 00:07:49,251
Is that... A tooth.

192
00:07:51,271 --> 00:07:53,738
One down.

193
00:08:02,049 --> 00:08:03,125
What?

194
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:04,949
Say "trick-or-treat." No.

195
00:08:05,018 --> 00:08:06,362
God, you're no fun sometimes.

196
00:08:06,386 --> 00:08:09,570
Trick-or-treat.
What? A treat for you.

197
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:11,350
Well, first of all, the
X-rays are backwards.

198
00:08:11,374 --> 00:08:14,092
No, they're not. The organs are.

199
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,404
No way. Mmm-hmm.

200
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:16,539
He has situs inversus?

201
00:08:16,563 --> 00:08:18,763
All his organs are
completely backwards,

202
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:19,976
mirrored to the normal position.

203
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,183
This guy was shot
twice in the chest.

204
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:24,813
He didn't die. Murphy
could barely find a heartbeat,

205
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:26,983
but it turns out his heart
was on the other side.

206
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:28,718
I have wanted to see
this since med school.

207
00:08:28,742 --> 00:08:31,476
I know that. Happy Halloween.

208
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:36,497
It started last night.
She loves Halloween.

209
00:08:36,566 --> 00:08:38,011
She's been in this
costume for days.

210
00:08:38,035 --> 00:08:39,111
And I have to go
out of town today

211
00:08:39,135 --> 00:08:40,329
for work.

212
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:43,537
Last trip was Brazil.
I got to go, too.

213
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:44,716
And I couldn't take
her with me on this one,

214
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:46,273
so we had Halloween early.

215
00:08:46,342 --> 00:08:48,087
We watched part
of a scary movie,

216
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:49,238
and...

217
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:50,957
<i>Poltergeist.</i> It was awesome.

218
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,498
I paged Dr. Robbins.

219
00:08:53,567 --> 00:08:55,467
No, you paged Peds. You got me.

220
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:58,669
Taryn, I'm Dr. Karev. So
you have a stomachache?

221
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:00,866
You don't know any
magic spells to fix it?

222
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:02,885
Well, we had some candy
last night during the movie,

223
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:04,909
and she got sick a few times.

224
00:09:04,978 --> 00:09:06,678
Candy for dinner. Nice.

225
00:09:06,747 --> 00:09:08,012
Ow.

226
00:09:08,081 --> 00:09:09,541
All right, she has some
guarding and a fever,

227
00:09:09,565 --> 00:09:11,293
so it's probably not the candy.

228
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:14,130
I'd like to do further
testing. Draw labs.

229
00:09:14,154 --> 00:09:17,321
I still get to
trick-or-treat, right?

230
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:20,408
Are you kidding? The best
trick-or-treating in Seattle

231
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:22,660
is right here on the Peds floor.

232
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:25,029
You go around with
these huge pillowcases.

233
00:09:25,098 --> 00:09:28,578
Everyone hands out as
much candy as you can carry.

234
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,235
He didn't die.

235
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:34,116
They shot him in the heart
twice, and he didn't die.

236
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,540
I thought he was just crazy.

237
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:36,808
He was just crazy.

238
00:09:36,877 --> 00:09:38,242
Then why didn't he die?

239
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:39,622
I've got a needle
right next to your face.

240
00:09:39,646 --> 00:09:41,090
I need you to
calm it down, okay?

241
00:09:41,114 --> 00:09:42,674
Is there any pain elsewhere?

242
00:09:42,732 --> 00:09:43,972
It's just sore.

243
00:09:44,017 --> 00:09:45,516
And stiff.

244
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,551
Oh, my God.

245
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,270
Is this rigor mortis?

246
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:52,690
Victor, zombies aren't
real. We know this, right?

247
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:55,193
You... You should quarantine...

248
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:58,029
Victor, squeeze my hand.

249
00:09:58,098 --> 00:09:59,642
Did you hit your head
when he attacked you?

250
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:00,776
You should quarantine...

251
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,361
Can you smile for me, buddy?

252
00:10:02,385 --> 00:10:03,913
Uh... JACKSON: No,
he's having a stroke.

253
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:05,848
There's pulsatile mass.
Could be damage to the carotid.

254
00:10:05,872 --> 00:10:07,533
Maybe a pseudoaneurysm.
All right, get the ultrasound.

255
00:10:07,557 --> 00:10:08,797
I'm gonna book an OR.

256
00:10:09,576 --> 00:10:11,209
Mrs. Wiltern?

257
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:12,544
Uh, Walker. Marge Walker.

258
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,111
Take me home, Philip.

259
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:17,214
Mom? Uh, Sorry. She's
a little afraid of hospitals.

260
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:21,152
Oh, well, in that case, I'll
be very, very gentle, okay?

261
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,965
It says you hurt your leg?

262
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:26,035
She says it was a bug bite
or something that got infected.

263
00:10:26,059 --> 00:10:27,436
And then she said
it hurts like heck.

264
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,627
She's been popping
ibuprofen like it's candy.

265
00:10:29,696 --> 00:10:30,878
I had to drag her in here.

266
00:10:30,947 --> 00:10:33,631
It's fine. Philip, take me home.

267
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:36,195
Mom, no. Not until
you let her check it out.

268
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:37,596
Just try to relax, okay?

269
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,287
I'm gonna take a look.

270
00:10:43,126 --> 00:10:44,559
Uh, when did this happen?

271
00:10:44,645 --> 00:10:46,160
About four months ago.

272
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:47,728
Four months ago?

273
00:10:53,453 --> 00:10:54,453
<i>Maggots.</i>

274
00:10:54,504 --> 00:10:56,671
Gross. Writhing and pulsing.

275
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:57,850
We know what maggots are.

276
00:10:57,874 --> 00:10:59,235
At first, they were
a little bit blurry

277
00:10:59,259 --> 00:11:00,620
because my eyes... I
just had eye surgery.

278
00:11:00,644 --> 00:11:02,521
What? What? What
are you doing here?

279
00:11:02,545 --> 00:11:04,340
I'm fine. You shouldn't
be seeing patients.

280
00:11:04,364 --> 00:11:05,429
But I wanna be helpful.

281
00:11:05,499 --> 00:11:07,209
Well, great. Then
you can go to the store

282
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:08,761
any buy some Halloween candy.

283
00:11:08,785 --> 00:11:10,879
Name brands, none of
those Smarties or candy corns.

284
00:11:10,903 --> 00:11:12,403
But I'm not supposed to drive.

285
00:11:12,472 --> 00:11:13,899
Luckily, someone
invented the bus pass.

286
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:15,434
Come on, Grey. You're not
gonna make her take the bus.

287
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:16,608
Thank you, Dr. Torres.

288
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:19,956
There's a shop just up
the street. You can walk.

289
00:11:21,798 --> 00:11:23,375
You're looking for what again?

290
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:26,595
You know, one of those little
head mirrors that doctors wear.

291
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:28,085
Ben, you are a doctor.

292
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:29,949
Have you ever worn one? No.

293
00:11:29,973 --> 00:11:31,573
Because they stopped using them

294
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:33,169
a century ago.

295
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:34,603
What are they teaching
you down there?

296
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:36,605
Tuck wants to be a
mad scientist tonight.

297
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:38,190
He should have one of
those little head mirror things.

298
00:11:38,214 --> 00:11:39,680
Well, I have a brain in a jar.

299
00:11:39,749 --> 00:11:42,778
But I wanna give him a
costume, not a nightmare.

300
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:44,118
What did he do to you?

301
00:11:44,187 --> 00:11:45,848
Torres and I are working
on thought control prosthetics.

302
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:48,038
I'm trying to figure out a
way to insert the sensors

303
00:11:48,107 --> 00:11:50,174
through a smaller craniotomy.

304
00:11:50,243 --> 00:11:52,677
Aw, you should be
ashamed of yourself.

305
00:11:52,746 --> 00:11:54,979
I'm sorry? Well,
that's for Zola tonight.

306
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:56,231
It was ripped. I fixed it.

307
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:58,144
Yeah, if you call this "fixed."

308
00:11:58,168 --> 00:11:59,628
I mean, I could do a
running whipstitch so smooth

309
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:01,964
the butterfly would never even
know there'd been a rupture.

310
00:12:01,988 --> 00:12:04,166
What are you teaching up here?

311
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:05,667
I would like to take a biopsy

312
00:12:05,691 --> 00:12:07,070
to see if the infection's
gotten into the bone.

313
00:12:07,094 --> 00:12:09,094
And we are gonna need
to take you down to the OR

314
00:12:09,162 --> 00:12:10,962
to clean the parasites
out of that wound.

315
00:12:11,031 --> 00:12:12,730
No! No! Take me home!

316
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:13,831
Mom.

317
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,394
Take me home! Mom. Mom. Mom.

318
00:12:15,418 --> 00:12:17,279
All right, we can give you a
sedative to ease the anxiety.

319
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:20,315
No! No needles! No
needles! Just go away!

320
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:23,979
Just leave me alone!
Don't! Just go away! Don't...

321
00:12:26,129 --> 00:12:27,378
She's always hated doctors,

322
00:12:27,447 --> 00:12:30,030
but it's gotten out of
control since my dad died.

323
00:12:30,099 --> 00:12:31,477
I don't want to sound cruel,

324
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:32,978
but can't you just
put her in restraints

325
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:35,086
and give her a
sedative or something?

326
00:12:35,155 --> 00:12:36,582
Well... I have an idea.

327
00:12:36,606 --> 00:12:39,846
I'm going to the gift
shop. I'll be back.

328
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:44,376
Put her in bed three.
Get an X-ray of the ankle.

329
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:47,843
Bed five should be empty.
Get a rapid influenza.

330
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:49,651
Could be the flu.
Right away, Doctor.

331
00:12:51,755 --> 00:12:53,988
Uh, ma'am?

332
00:12:55,659 --> 00:12:57,620
I'm waiting for my doctor.

333
00:12:57,644 --> 00:13:00,494
Well, I'm your doctor now, so...

334
00:13:01,932 --> 00:13:03,932
What's your doctor's
name? Maybe I can find them.

335
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:08,102
Dr. Brooks.

336
00:13:08,171 --> 00:13:10,338
Heather Brooks.

337
00:13:10,407 --> 00:13:12,106
I'm sorry. She's not here.

338
00:13:12,175 --> 00:13:13,708
Yes, she is.

339
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:16,810
She's always here.

340
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:29,919
<i>She said she'll only
see Heather Brooks.</i>

341
00:13:29,943 --> 00:13:31,587
Can I tell her about Heather?

342
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:34,178
You wanna tell a sick old
lady her favorite doctor is dead?

343
00:13:34,247 --> 00:13:35,747
That seem like a
good idea to you?

344
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:38,327
No. It's just, she's pretty
insistent on seeing Dr. Brooks.

345
00:13:38,351 --> 00:13:40,701
Then tell her it's not
possible and treat her yourself.

346
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:43,655
Um... Where is she?

347
00:13:43,723 --> 00:13:45,923
I don't know. She was
right there a second ago.

348
00:13:47,393 --> 00:13:51,395
Uh, Murphy's bitten, Edwards
is blind, and you're bonkers.

349
00:13:51,464 --> 00:13:52,697
No!

350
00:13:52,766 --> 00:13:53,915
Another one down.

351
00:13:56,903 --> 00:13:58,486
Holy...

352
00:13:58,555 --> 00:14:01,772
Ma'am, I'd like to get
you started on medication.

353
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:04,208
I need to know your name
so we can get you registered.

354
00:14:04,277 --> 00:14:06,828
No, I'll wait for Doctor...

355
00:14:06,896 --> 00:14:09,397
Dr. Brooks isn't here. I am.

356
00:14:09,465 --> 00:14:11,049
Just tell me your name.

357
00:14:11,117 --> 00:14:14,268
If you don't, I'll have to go
through all Dr. Brooks' charts.

358
00:14:14,337 --> 00:14:16,838
How about you save me all that
trouble and tell me your name?

359
00:14:16,906 --> 00:14:18,639
She'll come.

360
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:23,956
Okay, I'm tracking
one of the bullets

361
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:26,280
through the accessory lobe.

362
00:14:26,349 --> 00:14:28,027
That's the middle lobe.

363
00:14:28,051 --> 00:14:30,418
Right. Right.
It's the right lung.

364
00:14:30,486 --> 00:14:31,786
Mmm-hmm.

365
00:14:31,855 --> 00:14:34,022
This is like driving in England.

366
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:36,807
You know, I have to keep thinking
about every move that I make.

367
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,716
It's gonna take twice
as long as it should.

368
00:14:39,262 --> 00:14:41,696
Okay.

369
00:14:41,781 --> 00:14:43,448
You got plans tonight?

370
00:14:43,516 --> 00:14:47,785
Meredith semi-invited
me to this baby fest tonight.

371
00:14:47,854 --> 00:14:49,598
But I can't tell if she
really wants me to go

372
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:51,083
or if she just felt
she had to ask.

373
00:14:51,107 --> 00:14:52,968
It's so complicated. Right?

374
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:54,953
She and I used to just know
what the other one was thinking.

375
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:56,093
I meant this.

376
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:00,926
There's still bleeding
in the upper lobe.

377
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:02,361
I need more proximal control.

378
00:15:02,385 --> 00:15:04,018
Duval lung clamp.

379
00:15:04,087 --> 00:15:05,631
Straight vascular clamp, please.

380
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:08,722
Okay. Oh, watch
out for the SVC. Ah.

381
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:10,725
Nicked the SVC. It
shouldn't even be there!

382
00:15:10,794 --> 00:15:13,827
I got you this so you don't
have to shut your eyes so tight.

383
00:15:13,896 --> 00:15:16,397
And you don't have to
see. You wanna try it?

384
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:24,772
There.

385
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:26,301
So let's forget
we're in a hospital.

386
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:27,736
Let's talk about
Halloween. Okay.

387
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,072
Do you get a lot of
kids at your house? No.

388
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:31,195
Oh.

389
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:32,479
Too bad.

390
00:15:32,548 --> 00:15:34,493
All of the kids in the
neighborhood are Philip's age.

391
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:36,917
They're all grown up and gone.

392
00:15:36,986 --> 00:15:40,638
But when he was little,

393
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:42,089
it was nuts.

394
00:15:42,157 --> 00:15:43,541
A real madhouse, huh?

395
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,292
Yeah, kids everywhere.

396
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:48,245
Philip loved it. His
favorite holiday.

397
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:51,482
He always needed a costume
they didn't sell in the stores,

398
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:52,845
and I always
needed to make it...

399
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:54,718
What's happening?

400
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,031
It's okay. We're just...
We're gonna take a little walk.

401
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:57,866
We're gonna go down to
the OR and get you a gown.

402
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:59,034
Is that okay?

403
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:00,675
Yeah. Yeah, but...

404
00:16:00,744 --> 00:16:03,611
It's okay. It's gonna be okay.

405
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:06,675
So you made all of his
costumes from scratch, huh?

406
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:08,883
What did he go as?

407
00:16:08,952 --> 00:16:11,452
Well, one year, he
went as an aardvark.

408
00:16:15,124 --> 00:16:17,202
Taryn's labs show a
slightly elevated white count,

409
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:19,660
and some of her
electrolytes are off.

410
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:21,907
Um, is she gonna
be here overnight?

411
00:16:21,931 --> 00:16:23,142
It's just that her
dad wants to know

412
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:24,760
if he should change his flight.

413
00:16:24,784 --> 00:16:26,962
Yeah, his eight-year-old has
a potentially surgical abdomen.

414
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:30,054
She needs a CT. She's in
pain. He should change his flight.

415
00:16:31,223 --> 00:16:33,401
Dude, what is your problem?

416
00:16:33,425 --> 00:16:35,303
I know you think he's
an ass, but he's not.

417
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,372
He's not your dad.

418
00:16:36,396 --> 00:16:38,173
Don't even... What?

419
00:16:38,197 --> 00:16:40,192
Pretend that you're not angry
and hurt and about to explode?

420
00:16:40,216 --> 00:16:43,183
I've been doing
that. It's not working.

421
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:45,886
Tell me what I can
do to make this better.

422
00:16:45,955 --> 00:16:48,656
Just get a CT.

423
00:16:50,643 --> 00:16:53,421
So I thought the second
one would be easier,

424
00:16:53,445 --> 00:16:55,323
but it's just like having
one all over again,

425
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:56,814
except now there are two.

426
00:16:56,882 --> 00:16:59,161
So you're twice as exhausted.

427
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:00,713
Okay, we're all set.

428
00:17:00,737 --> 00:17:03,114
Okay. Okay, Marge,
we're in the OR.

429
00:17:03,138 --> 00:17:06,157
And we are ready to operate.

430
00:17:06,226 --> 00:17:07,866
You'll be here the
whole time, Meredith?

431
00:17:07,893 --> 00:17:09,276
The whole time.

432
00:17:09,345 --> 00:17:11,145
Okay. Yes.

433
00:17:12,348 --> 00:17:13,564
I'm ready.

434
00:17:13,633 --> 00:17:14,899
Okay.

435
00:17:14,968 --> 00:17:16,846
You know, if you
segmented the wings,

436
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:18,180
then she'd flap when she moved.

437
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:19,681
She just has to
look like a butterfly.

438
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,065
She doesn't
actually have to fly.

439
00:17:22,759 --> 00:17:23,959
How'd you swing the time off?

440
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:26,877
You know, I just made it happen.

441
00:17:26,946 --> 00:17:28,824
Halloween was always
my favorite night as a kid,

442
00:17:28,848 --> 00:17:30,959
and I just wanted to spend
it with my family, you know?

443
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:32,766
You're so domesticated.

444
00:17:32,835 --> 00:17:35,116
You're suturing a
butterfly costume.

445
00:17:35,455 --> 00:17:36,887
You know...

446
00:17:36,956 --> 00:17:38,534
You know, if we attach
this to her wrist with strings,

447
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:40,023
it'd sort of fan out.

448
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:43,026
That's a brilliant idea.

449
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:44,945
Right. It's totally worth it.

450
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:47,198
Yeah, keep stitching.

451
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:53,916
They're incompetent.
It's not their fault,

452
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:56,290
because it's how
they were raised.

453
00:17:56,359 --> 00:18:00,093
These days, parents think
all of their kids are geniuses.

454
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:03,597
And everyone gets a trophy
just for being on the soccer team.

455
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:05,232
They're not the problem.

456
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,951
You are.

457
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:10,270
I'm trying to teach them,
and you won't let them learn.

458
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:12,940
I can barely get
out of this bed.

459
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:14,641
I can't operate.

460
00:18:14,711 --> 00:18:16,644
Who knows if I ever will?

461
00:18:16,713 --> 00:18:19,313
The only thing that
gives me some meaning.

462
00:18:19,382 --> 00:18:24,067
Hell, some days the only thing that
keeps me going is teaching them.

463
00:18:24,137 --> 00:18:27,472
And you're standing
in the way of that.

464
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:30,124
So I'm gonna have
someone else supervise them.

465
00:18:34,931 --> 00:18:36,925
You're not kicking
me off this case.

466
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:37,982
Yes, I am.

467
00:18:40,937 --> 00:18:42,636
This is why when I fire someone,

468
00:18:44,207 --> 00:18:45,689
I like to do it in their office.

469
00:18:47,944 --> 00:18:50,494
So I can walk out.

470
00:18:50,563 --> 00:18:53,180
Walk out, Bailey.

471
00:18:53,249 --> 00:18:55,065
Now.

472
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,363
Wow, there is barely

473
00:19:15,387 --> 00:19:16,553
any necrotic tissue here.

474
00:19:16,622 --> 00:19:18,722
The maggots might have
actually saved her leg.

475
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:20,368
Well, remind me to
send them flowers.

476
00:19:20,392 --> 00:19:22,287
We may actually make
trick-or-treating tonight.

477
00:19:22,311 --> 00:19:25,496
Yeah, about that,
I'm bowing out tonight.

478
00:19:25,565 --> 00:19:27,726
Arizona and I can't be in the same
room for more than five minutes

479
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:30,912
before everything devolves
into gunfire and screaming.

480
00:19:30,936 --> 00:19:32,881
Sofia has been so
excited about Halloween.

481
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:35,417
I'm not about to let her
mommies' bickering ruin it, so...

482
00:19:35,441 --> 00:19:36,757
Taking one for the team.

483
00:19:36,826 --> 00:19:39,459
Are you sure? There's
gonna be a pinata.

484
00:19:39,528 --> 00:19:41,257
Shut up. And pin the
head on the skeleton.

485
00:19:41,281 --> 00:19:43,931
Damn it! They're so cute
when they're blindfolded.

486
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,966
Bobbing for apples. Aw!

487
00:19:46,035 --> 00:19:47,545
They're even cuter
when they bob!

488
00:19:47,569 --> 00:19:49,147
I'll take pictures.

489
00:19:49,171 --> 00:19:50,754
Dr. Grey, it's Dr. Webber.

490
00:19:50,823 --> 00:19:52,318
He's asking whether you
have room on your schedule

491
00:19:52,342 --> 00:19:53,582
for a cystogastrostomy.

492
00:19:55,011 --> 00:19:57,292
Maybe Derek can take pictures.

493
00:19:59,348 --> 00:20:00,893
Did you get your labs back?

494
00:20:00,917 --> 00:20:02,450
Nope.

495
00:20:02,518 --> 00:20:05,030
The post exposure counselor
gave me this cheerful little pamphlet

496
00:20:05,054 --> 00:20:09,073
on anti-viral drugs to
read while I'm waiting.

497
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:10,819
She said in case I do have HIV,

498
00:20:10,843 --> 00:20:13,355
it might not be a bad idea
to start taking them now.

499
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:15,545
You probably don't have HIV.

500
00:20:15,614 --> 00:20:17,314
I might.

501
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:19,216
I might never see again.

502
00:20:19,285 --> 00:20:20,863
You probably will. My uncle can.

503
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:21,997
You said he's in constant pain.

504
00:20:22,021 --> 00:20:23,954
Horrible pain.

505
00:20:24,023 --> 00:20:26,584
He had to give up his accounting
practice. He can't do math.

506
00:20:26,608 --> 00:20:30,344
I'm not gonna be able
to be a surgeon anymore.

507
00:20:30,412 --> 00:20:31,723
The counselor
said there are plenty

508
00:20:31,747 --> 00:20:33,025
of other health
care jobs available

509
00:20:33,049 --> 00:20:34,676
apart from surgery.

510
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,933
Like what?

511
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:39,903
Like post-exposure counseling.

512
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:42,183
But I won't know which
pamphlets to hand out

513
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:43,641
if I can't read them.

514
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:47,544
We're screwed.

515
00:20:47,613 --> 00:20:49,213
So screwed.

516
00:20:49,282 --> 00:20:51,159
Ugh! That's one
jacked up carotid.

517
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:52,794
Yeah, let's go ahead and
prep the synthetic graft.

518
00:20:52,818 --> 00:20:53,928
Okay. Starting it now.

519
00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:56,870
It's yours, Dr. Avery.
From Dr. Edwards.

520
00:20:56,939 --> 00:21:00,007
She wants to know if
you think she should

521
00:21:00,076 --> 00:21:02,859
call the lasagna pleasant?

522
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:04,606
That's, like, her
15th misspelled text.

523
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:05,896
She's scared.

524
00:21:05,965 --> 00:21:07,776
Tell her not to call,
everything's gonna be fine,

525
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,482
and to keep using her eye drops.

526
00:21:10,836 --> 00:21:13,196
You know what? And
tell her that she's beautiful.

527
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:16,557
What? Who are you?

528
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:18,637
You were never that nice
to me when I would spin out.

529
00:21:18,661 --> 00:21:21,929
Well, maybe I am trying to
be a better boyfriend now.

530
00:21:21,998 --> 00:21:23,308
No, no, it helped
that you were an ass.

531
00:21:23,332 --> 00:21:25,377
It made me get my act together.

532
00:21:25,401 --> 00:21:28,530
I'm getting married, and I'm
saving this guy's life and his face.

533
00:21:28,554 --> 00:21:29,853
And that's all because of me.

534
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,418
Damn it. I mean, this was
supposed to be fun, and now...

535
00:21:33,442 --> 00:21:35,442
You're overcomplicating it.

536
00:21:35,511 --> 00:21:37,806
Just tell your left hand to do
what your right hand usually does.

537
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:39,674
Haven't you practiced
operating with both hands?

538
00:21:39,698 --> 00:21:41,310
Yeah. Upside down? Underwater?

539
00:21:41,334 --> 00:21:42,811
In a straitjacket?

540
00:21:42,835 --> 00:21:44,629
Yes, I have practiced
with both hands,

541
00:21:44,653 --> 00:21:46,333
but I can't just... Cut.

542
00:21:47,206 --> 00:21:48,289
See?

543
00:21:48,841 --> 00:21:50,073
Simple.

544
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:51,553
I'm sorry. I can't do it.

545
00:21:51,577 --> 00:21:52,971
Meredith, I just need
you to observe while a...

546
00:21:52,995 --> 00:21:54,990
I understand what you're
asking me... Meredith.

547
00:21:55,014 --> 00:21:57,682
Page the general
surgeon that's on call.

548
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:58,990
I don't have the time.

549
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:00,201
I'm sorry.

550
00:22:03,539 --> 00:22:05,350
I'm sorry for saying that
you were the wrong choice

551
00:22:05,374 --> 00:22:07,875
to be in charge of my care.

552
00:22:07,943 --> 00:22:10,561
For saying that you
should have let me die.

553
00:22:12,064 --> 00:22:14,898
I'm sorry for ever
feeling that way.

554
00:22:14,967 --> 00:22:18,135
Because I've remembered
what there is to live for.

555
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:22,159
I would have never gotten
here if it hadn't been for you.

556
00:22:23,659 --> 00:22:25,158
So I'm sorry.

557
00:22:26,813 --> 00:22:30,664
Meredith, please.
Help me teach them.

558
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:35,886
What is that, a fan?

559
00:22:35,955 --> 00:22:38,855
Yeah, exactly.
The array is a fan.

560
00:22:38,924 --> 00:22:41,592
Now if I can get the fan
to go in through a burr hole

561
00:22:41,661 --> 00:22:43,838
and open up under the skull,

562
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:45,040
the whole area would be covered

563
00:22:45,064 --> 00:22:46,658
with a fraction of the exposure.

564
00:22:46,682 --> 00:22:48,762
How has no one ever
thought of this yet?

565
00:22:48,817 --> 00:22:50,495
How have I never
thought of this yet?

566
00:22:50,519 --> 00:22:51,796
You don't look like
you're regretting

567
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:53,198
stepping back
from surgery at all.

568
00:22:53,222 --> 00:22:55,973
Well, it's only been
a week, but, uh, no.

569
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:58,075
What's the rush?
I got the kid's CT.

570
00:22:58,143 --> 00:23:00,143
You wanna fill me in?

571
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:01,757
Adrenal glands are
enlarged, coupled

572
00:23:01,781 --> 00:23:03,325
with high potassium,
low glucose,

573
00:23:03,349 --> 00:23:04,715
adrenal insufficiency.

574
00:23:04,784 --> 00:23:06,044
Her body's not producing
enough adrenaline?

575
00:23:06,068 --> 00:23:08,135
I'm glad you can read.

576
00:23:08,203 --> 00:23:10,838
But there's no tumor.
Unless it's an infection,

577
00:23:10,906 --> 00:23:13,841
maybe blastomycosis.

578
00:23:13,909 --> 00:23:16,438
Oh, God, her dad mentioned
that they just went to Brazil.

579
00:23:16,462 --> 00:23:17,695
What, are you kidding me?

580
00:23:17,764 --> 00:23:19,724
You didn't think you
should put that in her chart?

581
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:25,897
What the hell? MR. DAVIS:
Thanks for your help, and I'm sorry

582
00:23:25,921 --> 00:23:27,065
about the last-minute
cancellation.

583
00:23:27,089 --> 00:23:28,238
Where is she?

584
00:23:28,307 --> 00:23:29,640
She was just here.

585
00:23:29,709 --> 00:23:31,837
She was asking about
trick-or-treating around the hospital,

586
00:23:31,861 --> 00:23:33,672
and I just stepped
out to change my flight.

587
00:23:33,696 --> 00:23:35,123
You couldn't keep an eye
on her for five minutes?

588
00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:36,241
What's going on?

589
00:23:36,265 --> 00:23:37,981
Taryn's body isn't
producing adrenaline.

590
00:23:38,033 --> 00:23:39,566
You know what adrenaline does?

591
00:23:39,635 --> 00:23:41,546
It keeps your organs from going
into shock and shutting down

592
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:43,636
when you get hurt or
traumatized or scared.

593
00:23:43,706 --> 00:23:45,550
You said that she started
to feel sick last night

594
00:23:45,574 --> 00:23:47,552
watching the scary movie?
She wanted to watch it.

595
00:23:47,576 --> 00:23:49,471
She's wandering through
the hospital on Halloween.

596
00:23:49,495 --> 00:23:51,823
Look, if something frightens
her, she could go into shock.

597
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:53,892
She can get scared to death?

598
00:23:53,916 --> 00:23:55,782
We gotta go find her.

599
00:23:57,670 --> 00:23:59,380
I'm looking for a crazy
lady with weird eyes.

600
00:23:59,404 --> 00:24:00,737
Too soon, Shane.

601
00:24:00,806 --> 00:24:02,640
No, seriously, she
disappeared again.

602
00:24:02,708 --> 00:24:05,020
She was Heather's patient,
and she won't tell me her name.

603
00:24:05,044 --> 00:24:06,555
And there's no record
of her anywhere.

604
00:24:06,579 --> 00:24:07,939
And every time I go
to find her, she's gone.

605
00:24:07,963 --> 00:24:09,362
Oh...

606
00:24:09,431 --> 00:24:11,498
Well, maybe she's a ghost.

607
00:24:11,566 --> 00:24:13,762
Forget it. Stop.
She's probably a stray.

608
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:17,771
Heather was always taking them
in. The homeless, the uninsured.

609
00:24:39,545 --> 00:24:40,722
Trick-or-treat.

610
00:24:59,598 --> 00:25:00,664
Trick-or-treat.

611
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:28,875
Get me D10 normal saline
and bring a crash cart right away!

612
00:25:28,945 --> 00:25:29,977
I'll get it.

613
00:25:30,046 --> 00:25:32,029
Taryn, can you hear
me? WOMAN: Dr. Karev?

614
00:25:32,098 --> 00:25:33,791
Give me that gurney!
Right away, Doctor.

615
00:25:33,815 --> 00:25:37,501
She's in shock
from adrenal crisis.

616
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:40,003
Get me her blood pressure,
and get those fluids started.

617
00:25:40,072 --> 00:25:41,087
I'm on it.

618
00:25:43,342 --> 00:25:44,542
Let's get her legs elevated.

619
00:25:46,895 --> 00:25:49,279
Expiratory wheezing,
get her on five-liter O2.

620
00:25:49,348 --> 00:25:50,797
Systolic's 60.

621
00:25:50,866 --> 00:25:53,300
I need an IV hydrocortisone
and a central line kit.

622
00:25:53,368 --> 00:25:55,496
Have the PICU get a bed
ready, and get her to the ER.

623
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,553
Right away.

624
00:25:58,307 --> 00:26:01,141
This doesn't look
like a hospital.

625
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:02,704
We've taken all
of the unnecessary

626
00:26:02,728 --> 00:26:04,456
medical equipment
out of the room.

627
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,524
And Philip is bringing some
more of your things from home.

628
00:26:06,548 --> 00:26:08,577
And I've even put
a sign on the door,

629
00:26:08,601 --> 00:26:11,268
so all the doctors and staff
will respect your privacy.

630
00:26:12,972 --> 00:26:14,204
Okay... Um...

631
00:26:16,308 --> 00:26:18,409
Do you want me to stay?

632
00:26:18,477 --> 00:26:20,927
Don't you have kids
to get to for Halloween?

633
00:26:20,997 --> 00:26:23,664
Yeah, but, you know,
it's okay. Oh, no.

634
00:26:23,732 --> 00:26:24,965
You don't want to miss it.

635
00:26:25,034 --> 00:26:26,667
You only get 10
before they go off

636
00:26:26,735 --> 00:26:27,946
on Halloween with their friends,

637
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:29,669
getting into trouble.

638
00:26:29,738 --> 00:26:31,738
You gotta enjoy
it while you can.

639
00:26:36,178 --> 00:26:37,655
That wasn't so bad, was it?

640
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,257
Yeah, and you can
make it to your party,

641
00:26:39,281 --> 00:26:40,931
if you're going.

642
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,245
I Am. You know, I'll show up,

643
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:45,113
I'll have a beer,
Mer and I will talk,

644
00:26:45,137 --> 00:26:47,354
and we'll move
past this whole thing.

645
00:26:47,423 --> 00:26:49,303
Good.

646
00:26:50,726 --> 00:26:53,427
Oh, it's Meredith.

647
00:26:53,495 --> 00:26:55,540
"If you're coming to the party,
could you bring cupcakes?

648
00:26:55,564 --> 00:26:57,931
"If not, no problem."

649
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,533
What does that mean?

650
00:26:59,601 --> 00:27:00,979
It's no problem if I don't go,

651
00:27:01,003 --> 00:27:02,797
or no problem if I
don't bring cupcakes?

652
00:27:02,821 --> 00:27:04,849
And if I don't go, then
there's no cupcakes?

653
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:06,518
Or will someone else bring them?

654
00:27:06,542 --> 00:27:09,121
And if someone else is bringing
them, why is she even asking me?

655
00:27:09,145 --> 00:27:11,545
Don't overcomplicate it.

656
00:27:11,613 --> 00:27:12,746
Just go.

657
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:20,871
The cortisone will prevent
another adrenal crisis.

658
00:27:20,939 --> 00:27:23,240
Taryn should
make a full recovery.

659
00:27:23,309 --> 00:27:25,219
I never would have
taken her to Brazil with me

660
00:27:25,243 --> 00:27:27,177
if I had known
she could get sick.

661
00:27:27,245 --> 00:27:28,962
I know. And the movie...

662
00:27:29,031 --> 00:27:30,347
She loves scary movies.

663
00:27:31,901 --> 00:27:33,149
It was one bad call.

664
00:27:33,218 --> 00:27:35,313
That's all it was,
just one bad call.

665
00:27:35,337 --> 00:27:36,457
I'm a good dad.

666
00:27:36,505 --> 00:27:39,439
Don't let what Dr. Karev said...

667
00:27:39,508 --> 00:27:41,357
He's just...

668
00:27:42,478 --> 00:27:45,028
He's so good with kids

669
00:27:45,097 --> 00:27:49,149
but just so crappy
with other people.

670
00:27:50,218 --> 00:27:53,070
He knows you're a good dad.

671
00:28:01,246 --> 00:28:02,412
Is my face fixed?

672
00:28:02,481 --> 00:28:04,025
Not quite yet.
Our first priority

673
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:05,510
was repairing
your injured carotid,

674
00:28:05,534 --> 00:28:07,145
which was damaged
when you were attacked.

675
00:28:07,169 --> 00:28:09,035
Oh, God.

676
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:10,582
The zombie, where is he? - No.

677
00:28:10,606 --> 00:28:13,773
He's not quarantined?
Is that where this is?

678
00:28:13,842 --> 00:28:15,220
I've been
quarantined, haven't I?

679
00:28:15,244 --> 00:28:16,727
Oh, God, I knew it.

680
00:28:16,795 --> 00:28:20,797
I saw this thing on cable
about these rituals in Haiti,

681
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:24,167
and I thought they were all crap,
but you've got me quarantined.

682
00:28:24,236 --> 00:28:26,097
Except you're not
quarantined. This is the ICU.

683
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:27,498
Which means you wouldn't
tell me the truth anyway.

684
00:28:27,522 --> 00:28:29,501
They've got you on a
gag order, don't they?

685
00:28:29,525 --> 00:28:31,202
Because that's what
they do, the CDC. Okay.

686
00:28:31,226 --> 00:28:33,054
They don't want you
to tell me the truth.

687
00:28:33,078 --> 00:28:35,045
Hey, Victor! Victor!
Hey, hey! Listen to me!

688
00:28:35,113 --> 00:28:37,614
Victor, you are not
under quarantine.

689
00:28:37,683 --> 00:28:39,583
You are in the
ICU, which is where

690
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:41,468
we take patients after surgery.

691
00:28:41,537 --> 00:28:44,404
You were attacked by a normal
guy who took a bunch of drugs,

692
00:28:44,473 --> 00:28:45,989
lost his mind, and attacked you.

693
00:28:46,058 --> 00:28:47,468
He didn't die when he was shot

694
00:28:47,492 --> 00:28:49,437
because he's got a
condition called situs inversus,

695
00:28:49,461 --> 00:28:52,045
which put his heart on the
opposite side of his chest.

696
00:28:53,816 --> 00:28:55,265
That's random.

697
00:28:55,334 --> 00:28:57,468
Yeah, completely
random, and also

698
00:28:57,536 --> 00:28:59,753
not in the least
bit supernatural.

699
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:01,500
And really, honestly,
when you think about it,

700
00:29:01,524 --> 00:29:06,860
isn't that, like, 100 times scarier
than some zombie apocalypse?

701
00:29:08,347 --> 00:29:10,613
Yeah.

702
00:29:10,682 --> 00:29:12,015
Yeah, okay, I guess it is.

703
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,185
Okay.

704
00:29:18,124 --> 00:29:20,124
See, someone
starts spinning out,

705
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:21,792
you just shut it down.

706
00:29:21,861 --> 00:29:24,461
But, you know, you can still
tell him he's pretty, if you want to.

707
00:29:28,867 --> 00:29:29,933
Fix the wings?

708
00:29:30,001 --> 00:29:31,841
Yes, and changed
the future of science.

709
00:29:31,904 --> 00:29:33,365
I figured out the sensor array.

710
00:29:33,389 --> 00:29:36,140
I insert it into a
two-centimeter burr hole.

711
00:29:36,208 --> 00:29:38,058
Great!

712
00:29:38,127 --> 00:29:39,437
Well, I have to find a resident
to do Webber's pseudocyst,

713
00:29:39,461 --> 00:29:41,089
or I'm not even gonna
make it to trick-or-treat.

714
00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:42,296
Go. See you at the house.

715
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:43,730
Okay.

716
00:29:43,798 --> 00:29:47,133
<i>Dr. Mahoney to the ER.
Dr. Mahoney to the ER.</i>

717
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:50,386
Shane. You win.
Webber's pseudocyst.

718
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:53,775
- Let's go, Shane. Suit up.
- Big leagues.

719
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:57,076
I have a patient.

720
00:29:57,145 --> 00:30:00,931
Could I talk to you about Alex?

721
00:30:00,999 --> 00:30:05,518
Yes, I know a place we can
go where no one will interrupt us.

722
00:30:05,588 --> 00:30:07,320
Trick-or-treat!

723
00:30:07,389 --> 00:30:09,233
- Trick-or-treat!
- Thank you.

724
00:30:09,257 --> 00:30:10,757
Hey, kids, slow down!

725
00:30:10,826 --> 00:30:12,893
That house! Hurry!

726
00:30:21,786 --> 00:30:23,426
Boo!

727
00:30:25,607 --> 00:30:27,123
Oh, my goodness.

728
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:31,144
Welcome to my laboratory. Ah!

729
00:30:31,213 --> 00:30:32,695
It's great.

730
00:30:32,764 --> 00:30:34,113
Mommy, Ben did all this.

731
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,748
Look, there's even smoke!

732
00:30:35,817 --> 00:30:37,612
Oh, I see!

733
00:30:37,636 --> 00:30:39,669
Well, I had some help.

734
00:30:39,738 --> 00:30:43,489
Well, look at you,
Dr. Crazy Person.

735
00:30:43,558 --> 00:30:45,993
You look so good!

736
00:30:46,061 --> 00:30:48,194
Okay, go and get your
trick-or-treat bag now.

737
00:30:49,998 --> 00:30:52,015
Huh?

738
00:30:52,084 --> 00:30:54,451
I told you, this is my holiday.

739
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:57,570
You are amazing.

740
00:30:58,724 --> 00:31:01,225
He's so happy.

741
00:31:01,293 --> 00:31:02,659
We had fun. You know, we should

742
00:31:02,728 --> 00:31:04,055
do stuff like this all the time.

743
00:31:04,079 --> 00:31:06,679
Yeah, he'd love that.

744
00:31:06,748 --> 00:31:08,464
I would, too. Right?

745
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:10,917
I mean, this holidays
and weekends crap...

746
00:31:10,986 --> 00:31:13,604
I want to be back here
in Seattle with you guys.

747
00:31:13,672 --> 00:31:15,338
Yeah, I know.

748
00:31:15,407 --> 00:31:17,618
But, well, you can't drop
out of residency in the middle.

749
00:31:17,642 --> 00:31:20,343
In a few years,
we'll... Um, I did.

750
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,412
I quit.

751
00:31:25,934 --> 00:31:28,368
You what?

752
00:31:28,437 --> 00:31:31,166
Hey, have you seen Wilson?
'Cause I need to get an update on...

753
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:33,239
What's wrong?

754
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:34,386
Nothing's wrong. I'm fine.

755
00:31:34,410 --> 00:31:35,410
You're crying.

756
00:31:36,945 --> 00:31:38,394
It's nothing. I'm fine.

757
00:31:40,765 --> 00:31:45,285
I got bit by a delusional,
psychotic drug addict

758
00:31:45,354 --> 00:31:47,604
who think he's the undead.

759
00:31:47,673 --> 00:31:50,507
And I'm waiting for
the guy's HIV results.

760
00:31:50,576 --> 00:31:51,841
Why didn't you tell me?

761
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:55,245
I'm trying to be easy peasy.

762
00:32:08,076 --> 00:32:10,560
My first needle stick
happened on a Tuesday.

763
00:32:12,464 --> 00:32:14,965
It was the second
month of my third year

764
00:32:15,033 --> 00:32:17,917
in my internal
medicine rotation.

765
00:32:17,986 --> 00:32:21,854
And my patient was
suffering from end stage AIDS.

766
00:32:23,791 --> 00:32:26,826
We had just switched over
to these retractable needles.

767
00:32:26,895 --> 00:32:31,431
And when I went to put his
into the hazardous waste,

768
00:32:33,168 --> 00:32:36,036
I didn't retract it right.

769
00:32:36,104 --> 00:32:39,839
And it jammed
right into my palm.

770
00:32:39,908 --> 00:32:42,042
And my whole body went cold.

771
00:32:44,312 --> 00:32:49,883
And I had never felt fear
like that in my whole life.

772
00:32:53,856 --> 00:32:56,390
Right now,

773
00:32:56,458 --> 00:32:59,158
it's not the time
to be easy peasy.

774
00:33:15,811 --> 00:33:16,926
She's dead.

775
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:23,149
Dr. Brooks died
three months ago.

776
00:33:27,272 --> 00:33:29,456
Well, that can't be true.

777
00:33:34,112 --> 00:33:37,246
You're not in the charts.

778
00:33:37,315 --> 00:33:39,582
She was treating you
under the table, right?

779
00:33:44,923 --> 00:33:48,624
She was giving you
these for your asthma?

780
00:33:50,912 --> 00:33:53,679
I didn't want her
to get into trouble.

781
00:33:56,418 --> 00:33:57,901
When you run out,

782
00:33:57,969 --> 00:34:00,337
you come back, you find me.

783
00:34:01,973 --> 00:34:03,940
I'll be your doctor now.

784
00:34:05,661 --> 00:34:07,661
She was a very good doctor.

785
00:34:09,531 --> 00:34:11,981
Are you as good as she was?

786
00:34:15,637 --> 00:34:16,669
No.

787
00:34:19,173 --> 00:34:20,406
But I will be.

788
00:34:30,001 --> 00:34:32,535
So there's the wall
of the pseudocyst.

789
00:34:32,604 --> 00:34:34,070
Now what do you do?

790
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:35,983
Enlarge the incision with
a dissecting instrument

791
00:34:36,007 --> 00:34:38,257
and use a stapler to
create the anastomosis.

792
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:40,343
Good. Carry on.

793
00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:42,329
Faster, but take your time.

794
00:34:42,397 --> 00:34:44,392
Can I tell you a
thing about Alex?

795
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:47,062
He doesn't want me to tell
anyone, but I don't know what to do.

796
00:34:47,086 --> 00:34:49,119
He keeps pushing me away.

797
00:34:49,188 --> 00:34:50,615
And you know
him better than I do.

798
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:51,738
Can't tell me.

799
00:34:51,806 --> 00:34:53,073
I can't?

800
00:34:53,141 --> 00:34:54,502
Telling me is the worst
thing you could do.

801
00:34:54,526 --> 00:34:55,992
If he told you, he trusted you.

802
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:58,778
So whatever it is, you have
to be the one to deal with it.

803
00:34:58,847 --> 00:35:00,492
I mean, of course he's
gonna to push you away,

804
00:35:00,516 --> 00:35:02,114
because he hates
being vulnerable.

805
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:04,743
But that's when he's gonna
need you to stick with him the most.

806
00:35:05,771 --> 00:35:06,953
I'll keep trying.

807
00:35:07,022 --> 00:35:08,399
We'll, you're gonna
have to do better than try,

808
00:35:08,423 --> 00:35:09,573
because my plate is full.

809
00:35:09,641 --> 00:35:11,875
I have too many kids
and too many patients,

810
00:35:11,944 --> 00:35:14,410
and I can't handle a
broken Alex right now.

811
00:35:14,479 --> 00:35:17,247
You can do it.

812
00:35:17,316 --> 00:35:21,451
Is it out of the question to get a
little consistency in this family?

813
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,502
What consistency?
I never see you.

814
00:35:26,308 --> 00:35:28,228
Trick-or-treat!
Oh, trick-or-treat.

815
00:35:28,293 --> 00:35:29,971
Look at you. You're so scary.

816
00:35:29,995 --> 00:35:31,439
Here.

817
00:35:31,463 --> 00:35:33,363
Thank you.

818
00:35:34,682 --> 00:35:36,449
You started the program.

819
00:35:36,518 --> 00:35:39,002
No, you upended
our lives because

820
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:41,454
it was extremely
important to you.

821
00:35:41,522 --> 00:35:42,883
It's not working.

822
00:35:42,907 --> 00:35:45,975
You are my family, and
I want to be with you.

823
00:35:46,044 --> 00:35:49,546
Trick-or-treat! Oh,
Cleopatra and a ladybug.

824
00:35:49,615 --> 00:35:50,814
Thank you.

825
00:35:50,883 --> 00:35:52,098
Trick-or-treat!

826
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:56,903
My life is happening,
and I'm elsewhere.

827
00:35:56,971 --> 00:35:58,287
You don't love it?

828
00:35:58,357 --> 00:36:00,022
You? Of course I...

829
00:36:00,091 --> 00:36:02,992
No, not me. Surgery.

830
00:36:03,061 --> 00:36:06,262
You left town a week
after we got married

831
00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:08,531
to learn surgery, because...

832
00:36:09,501 --> 00:36:11,534
You were in love with it.

833
00:36:11,603 --> 00:36:15,154
Yeah. But I am in
love with you more.

834
00:36:16,941 --> 00:36:18,941
You really gonna tell me
that's the wrong answer?

835
00:36:19,077 --> 00:36:20,210
I'm just...

836
00:36:22,147 --> 00:36:23,387
What?

837
00:36:24,282 --> 00:36:25,882
Miranda, what?

838
00:36:25,951 --> 00:36:28,284
Disappointed.

839
00:36:28,353 --> 00:36:29,553
In you.

840
00:36:34,726 --> 00:36:36,006
Can we go trick-or-treating now?

841
00:36:37,212 --> 00:36:40,346
You are so cute!

842
00:36:40,415 --> 00:36:42,131
Oh...

843
00:36:42,201 --> 00:36:44,918
Okay. Let me get my coat.

844
00:36:54,095 --> 00:36:56,207
<i>This is Emma Marling.
Please leave a message.</i>

845
00:36:56,231 --> 00:36:58,497
Emma, Owen.

846
00:36:58,566 --> 00:37:01,034
Uh, Listen, um...

847
00:37:01,102 --> 00:37:03,414
I wasn't ready to talk
about Cristina before,

848
00:37:03,438 --> 00:37:07,440
because things between she
and I were always so complicated.

849
00:37:07,508 --> 00:37:10,210
And I can't... I can't do
complicated right now.

850
00:37:10,278 --> 00:37:12,556
I don't even want to
think about complicated,

851
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:15,315
and that is what is
so great about you,

852
00:37:15,383 --> 00:37:18,351
is that you're, you
know, you're so easy.

853
00:37:18,419 --> 00:37:20,832
God, that came out wrong.
I don't mean you're easy.

854
00:37:20,856 --> 00:37:22,388
I mean you're simple.

855
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:27,104
Delete this.

856
00:37:33,101 --> 00:37:34,778
Emma? <i>Hi.</i>

857
00:37:34,802 --> 00:37:36,069
Hey.

858
00:37:36,138 --> 00:37:38,371
How'd she do? Fantastic.

859
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,757
Almost as if she
had a great teacher.

860
00:37:40,826 --> 00:37:43,576
Take me through it. I
want to hear every detail.

861
00:37:43,645 --> 00:37:45,178
Well, in the interest
of education,

862
00:37:45,247 --> 00:37:47,247
why don't we let
Dr. Wilson do that?

863
00:37:47,315 --> 00:37:49,599
I like the way you think, Grey.

864
00:37:49,667 --> 00:37:52,302
Okay, well, we started
your incision using...

865
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:54,820
No, no. Start from
the very beginning.

866
00:37:57,191 --> 00:37:58,775
Where'd you place the ports?

867
00:37:58,843 --> 00:38:01,711
Well, um, we took a look
at your previous incision

868
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:04,492
and decided to place
the xiphoid port lateral...

869
00:38:04,516 --> 00:38:07,734
<i>Halloween is not
for the faint of heart.</i>

870
00:38:07,802 --> 00:38:09,882
<i>There's a surprise
around every corner.</i>

871
00:38:10,772 --> 00:38:12,038
Rapid tests negative!

872
00:38:12,991 --> 00:38:14,140
Good for you.

873
00:38:14,209 --> 00:38:15,420
I have to go back in six
months to get tested again

874
00:38:15,444 --> 00:38:17,484
to be sure, but
it's looking good.

875
00:38:17,546 --> 00:38:19,357
What's wrong? You still blind?

876
00:38:19,381 --> 00:38:20,513
Bummer.

877
00:38:20,582 --> 00:38:22,081
Mmm!

878
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:24,117
Also, no hepatitis.

879
00:38:27,488 --> 00:38:29,066
What are you doing here?

880
00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:30,456
Dude, I'm waiting for my...

881
00:38:30,525 --> 00:38:31,691
Hi.

882
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:32,825
Jackson?

883
00:38:32,894 --> 00:38:34,193
Oh, damn it.

884
00:38:34,262 --> 00:38:37,580
I'm screwed! I'm so screwed.

885
00:38:37,649 --> 00:38:41,100
I really might never operate
again, and it's my fault.

886
00:38:41,186 --> 00:38:42,852
I went and had
surgery on my eyes

887
00:38:42,921 --> 00:38:46,389
because my glasses were
just a little bit annoying,

888
00:38:46,457 --> 00:38:48,119
and then I went
back to work too soon

889
00:38:48,143 --> 00:38:49,837
because I thought I
might get a little bit behind,

890
00:38:49,861 --> 00:38:51,944
which is so stupid.

891
00:38:52,013 --> 00:38:54,698
Yeah. Pretty stupid.

892
00:38:54,766 --> 00:38:56,548
What?

893
00:38:56,617 --> 00:38:58,296
You knew that I was gonna take
the whole day off with you, right?

894
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,697
We could have spent
the entire day at home

895
00:38:59,721 --> 00:39:01,332
on the couch while I
made you chicken soup

896
00:39:01,356 --> 00:39:03,873
and you watched
movies and slept it off.

897
00:39:03,941 --> 00:39:05,736
But, no, you had
to come to work.

898
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,071
You had to stress yourself
out and strain your eyes

899
00:39:08,095 --> 00:39:10,895
and make yourself miserable,
which I told you was gonna happen.

900
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:16,886
Can we do it tomorrow?

901
00:39:16,954 --> 00:39:18,714
We're gonna do
it right damn now.

902
00:39:19,257 --> 00:39:20,372
Come on.

903
00:39:24,813 --> 00:39:26,629
<i>Some of the surprises are good.</i>

904
00:39:26,698 --> 00:39:28,581
Hey! You made it. Hey, yeah.

905
00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:31,400
The party was great, and Sofia
is a champion apple-bobber.

906
00:39:31,469 --> 00:39:33,502
The wings look great!

907
00:39:33,571 --> 00:39:36,099
Hey, look at the little
space princess! Look!

908
00:39:36,123 --> 00:39:38,724
Hey! Go to mommy.

909
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:40,844
Hi! You want your wand?

910
00:39:40,912 --> 00:39:42,428
I don't hear any gunfire.

911
00:39:42,497 --> 00:39:44,597
Yeah, well, we'll only
get about 10 of these

912
00:39:44,666 --> 00:39:46,360
before she starts wanting
to wear slutty costumes

913
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:47,828
and run off with her
friends, and I'm not

914
00:39:47,852 --> 00:39:50,770
about to cut that
number in half.

915
00:39:50,839 --> 00:39:54,256
It's the first thing Arizona and
I have agreed on in months.

916
00:39:57,929 --> 00:39:59,194
Hey.

917
00:40:20,585 --> 00:40:21,985
Who's ready to
go trick-or-treating?

918
00:40:23,188 --> 00:40:25,348
Time for blast-off!
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

919
00:40:27,542 --> 00:40:29,475
All right, let's go! Whee!

920
00:40:29,944 --> 00:40:30,976
Yay!

921
00:40:31,913 --> 00:40:33,613
Um...

922
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:36,216
<i>And some of the
surprises are bad.</i>

923
00:40:36,284 --> 00:40:38,618
Are you gonna stay
here and hand out candy?

924
00:40:38,687 --> 00:40:41,732
No, I'm gonna eat candy in the
dark and pretend like I'm not home.

925
00:40:41,756 --> 00:40:42,855
Alex...

926
00:40:42,924 --> 00:40:44,651
I'll pass out your
freakin' candy. Relax.

927
00:40:44,675 --> 00:40:47,305
<i>What's important is that you
can't let the fear of the surprise</i>

928
00:40:47,329 --> 00:40:49,169
<i>stop you from
getting dressed up.</i>

929
00:40:51,733 --> 00:40:53,644
<i>And wandering up
to a stranger's house</i>

930
00:40:53,668 --> 00:40:55,718
<i>to ask the question.</i>

931
00:40:55,787 --> 00:40:57,587
What are you supposed to be?

932
00:40:57,655 --> 00:40:59,922
Sexy

933
00:40:59,991 --> 00:41:02,191
witch.

934
00:41:03,695 --> 00:41:06,028
You didn't have something
else to do tonight?

935
00:41:06,097 --> 00:41:08,897
I had many options, Sharky.

936
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:12,234
But this seemed the most fun.

937
00:41:13,738 --> 00:41:14,837
Can I buy you a drink?

938
00:41:20,078 --> 00:41:21,110
Tequila.

939
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,029
Two tequilas.

940
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:36,175
Lights are off!

941
00:41:46,437 --> 00:41:48,104
I was wrong about your dad.

942
00:41:49,791 --> 00:41:51,490
I made a bad call.

943
00:41:51,559 --> 00:41:53,175
I should have let you walk away,

944
00:41:53,244 --> 00:41:55,194
but I never would have
pushed you towards him

945
00:41:55,263 --> 00:41:57,247
if I thought that
you'd end up hurt.

946
00:41:57,315 --> 00:41:59,349
I didn't see it coming.

947
00:41:59,417 --> 00:42:02,418
You did, and I am so sorry.

948
00:42:02,487 --> 00:42:04,720
But it was one crappy call.

949
00:42:04,789 --> 00:42:06,121
That's all.

950
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:07,556
<i>So what'll it be?</i>

951
00:42:08,793 --> 00:42:10,326
<i>Trick?</i>

952
00:42:11,829 --> 00:42:13,579
<i>Or treat?</i>

953
00:42:13,648 --> 00:42:17,048
Get in, before the
trick-or-treaters think that I'm home.
