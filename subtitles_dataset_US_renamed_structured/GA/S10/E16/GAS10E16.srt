1
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:10,842
Oh, happy birthday, sir.

2
00:00:10,911 --> 00:00:12,589
Well, thank you.

3
00:00:12,613 --> 00:00:14,913
Uh, Richard, happy birthday.

4
00:00:14,982 --> 00:00:17,160
Now, you're only saying that
because you heard her say that.

5
00:00:17,184 --> 00:00:19,718
Uh... Guilty.

6
00:00:19,787 --> 00:00:21,782
Actually, can you come and
find me at the end of your day?

7
00:00:21,806 --> 00:00:23,989
I need to talk to you about
your surgical schedule.

8
00:00:24,058 --> 00:00:25,807
Oh, is that right?

9
00:00:25,893 --> 00:00:28,326
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

10
00:00:28,396 --> 00:00:30,073
Well, Catherine let it slip

11
00:00:30,097 --> 00:00:31,742
that she was gonna
be here today,

12
00:00:31,766 --> 00:00:34,344
so, I'm assuming there's
some sort of something.

13
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:36,513
Don't worry. Don't
worry. I... I like surprises.

14
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:40,789
I'm sorry, but it is actually
about your surgical schedule.

15
00:00:40,858 --> 00:00:42,936
Bailey, you can't lie to me.

16
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,976
Wait... I don't know
anything about any party.

17
00:00:45,046 --> 00:00:47,812
Happy birthday, though. Hmm.

18
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:50,349
Oh, oh, I do have
something for you, though.

19
00:00:50,418 --> 00:00:52,295
Owen, you shouldn't have.

20
00:00:52,319 --> 00:00:54,086
I didn't. It's from
the hospital.

21
00:00:54,155 --> 00:00:56,366
Uh, make sure you come and
see me at the end of the day.

22
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:57,667
Dr. Hunt, do you have a second?

23
00:00:57,691 --> 00:00:58,857
Yeah.

24
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:07,482
That would be great.

25
00:01:07,551 --> 00:01:10,063
<i>There's a stage you go
through during childbirth,</i>

26
00:01:10,087 --> 00:01:12,187
<i>and it's the toughest part.</i>

27
00:01:12,256 --> 00:01:14,289
<i>It's called the
transition stage.</i>

28
00:01:14,358 --> 00:01:16,541
Hey, happy birthday!
Happy birthday.

29
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:17,671
That's great. Thank you.

30
00:01:17,695 --> 00:01:18,960
It was.

31
00:01:19,029 --> 00:01:21,980
<i>You've been pushing
so hard and so long,</i>

32
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:25,000
<i>you're exhausted, spent.</i>

33
00:01:25,069 --> 00:01:27,953
<i>And there's nothing to
show for all of your effort.</i>

34
00:01:28,005 --> 00:01:29,604
Oh, my God! There she is!

35
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:31,117
Well, she's not
a she, she's an it,

36
00:01:31,141 --> 00:01:32,501
and she's fragile,
so, don't touch it.

37
00:01:32,525 --> 00:01:34,342
Sorry, I'm just, uh,
extremely excited.

38
00:01:34,411 --> 00:01:36,572
Well, you're not gonna be
printing anything just yet.

39
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:38,213
Isn't that the job?

40
00:01:38,281 --> 00:01:41,115
I... You hired me to help
re-engineer your... Your portal veins.

41
00:01:41,185 --> 00:01:43,552
I beat out 100
bioengineers for the gig.

42
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:45,887
I've, uh, cooked up
a couple of designs.

43
00:01:45,973 --> 00:01:47,238
Oh, that's awesome.

44
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:48,985
No, actually, it's presumptuous

45
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:50,620
until you've read
every scrap of data

46
00:01:50,644 --> 00:01:52,894
on every test we've
run, you touch nothing.

47
00:01:52,963 --> 00:01:54,540
There are the research binders,

48
00:01:54,564 --> 00:01:56,309
so, you should probably
just go ahead and dig in.

49
00:01:56,333 --> 00:01:58,516
Great. Can I, uh,
touch the chair?

50
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:07,025
Keep an eye on him.
He touches nothing.

51
00:02:07,094 --> 00:02:08,771
Do you want me to
watch him read? Yes.

52
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:10,578
<i>During this transition stage,</i>

53
00:02:10,647 --> 00:02:11,847
<i>it feels like you can't go on.</i>

54
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:15,617
<i>But it's only because
you're very nearly there.</i>

55
00:02:24,545 --> 00:02:26,094
Your son is four years old?

56
00:02:26,162 --> 00:02:27,495
Four, yes.

57
00:02:27,565 --> 00:02:29,947
And he's had two
previous conduit failures.

58
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:31,499
But your conduit works, right?

59
00:02:31,569 --> 00:02:33,213
From what we read,
Baby Nathan is doing great.

60
00:02:33,237 --> 00:02:36,537
Yes. It was successful
in Nathan's case.

61
00:02:36,606 --> 00:02:38,323
This clinical
trial is to identify

62
00:02:38,392 --> 00:02:39,757
certain aspects
of the procedure.

63
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,610
But he'll get the conduit?

64
00:02:41,678 --> 00:02:44,345
If you're chosen for the study.

65
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:46,031
Dr. Yang has the final say,

66
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:47,819
and I'm forwarding
your materials on to her.

67
00:02:48,819 --> 00:02:50,363
Ooh.

68
00:02:50,387 --> 00:02:51,820
Number 14 looks good.

69
00:02:51,889 --> 00:02:56,224
Some EC TCPC narrowing
with early signs of obstruction.

70
00:02:56,293 --> 00:02:57,937
There is evidence of... Hey.

71
00:02:57,961 --> 00:02:59,639
You, uh, picking
research subjects today?

72
00:02:59,663 --> 00:03:01,540
How's it going? Uh, good.

73
00:03:01,564 --> 00:03:03,109
Shane's meeting
with the candidates.

74
00:03:03,133 --> 00:03:04,966
I'm only looking at the hearts,

75
00:03:05,035 --> 00:03:06,813
trying to keep my
judgment unsullied.

76
00:03:06,837 --> 00:03:08,281
But it's hard finding candidates

77
00:03:08,305 --> 00:03:11,200
that meet all the
criteria. Yeah.

78
00:03:11,224 --> 00:03:12,273
You need this.

79
00:03:12,342 --> 00:03:15,444
What? A hypoplastic
left ventricle?

80
00:03:15,512 --> 00:03:17,128
No, like an algorithm.

81
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:20,898
Some scientific way of
choosing the perfect mate,

82
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:23,446
where you input only
the criteria you want,

83
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:26,249
and you're presented with
only suitable candidates.

84
00:03:26,273 --> 00:03:27,472
So, Internet dating.

85
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:29,352
Oh, right. They have that.

86
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:32,461
Listen, I don't
need a date. Okay?

87
00:03:32,529 --> 00:03:35,464
Oh, uh, keep me
posted on the hearts.

88
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:40,213
How long does it take to
wash one, like 10 seconds?

89
00:03:40,237 --> 00:03:42,315
I don't like a filthy
kitchen, either.

90
00:03:42,339 --> 00:03:45,018
Dirty cereal bowls in the sink
aren't gonna exactly tip the scales.

91
00:03:45,042 --> 00:03:46,436
Oh, my Jesus.

92
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:47,787
Well, now that he's
in the conversation,

93
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:49,155
I'll make sure to
clean the bowls...

94
00:03:49,179 --> 00:03:51,797
Your mother. Your mother.

95
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:53,666
Oh.

96
00:03:56,035 --> 00:03:58,603
Um... She does not look happy.

97
00:03:58,672 --> 00:03:59,782
Come on. It'll... It'll be fine.

98
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:01,067
Okay. All right.

99
00:04:01,091 --> 00:04:02,268
But you told her, right?

100
00:04:02,292 --> 00:04:03,435
Her? I did.

101
00:04:03,459 --> 00:04:05,410
How did she take it? Hmm?

102
00:04:06,196 --> 00:04:07,345
So,

103
00:04:09,183 --> 00:04:13,118
I understand
congratulations are in order.

104
00:04:17,307 --> 00:04:19,852
And how long have you been
experiencing this pain, Greg?

105
00:04:19,876 --> 00:04:21,037
You know, comes and goes.

106
00:04:21,061 --> 00:04:22,094
Ten years.

107
00:04:22,162 --> 00:04:23,661
Ten years?

108
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:25,274
Mmm-hmm, since we've been
married. He won't go see anyone.

109
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:28,149
I just got ObamaCare.
I'm a junk collector.

110
00:04:28,218 --> 00:04:30,535
I sell stuff at flea markets.

111
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:31,915
Doesn't really make
for regular coverage.

112
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:33,855
Oh, there's definitely
a mass here.

113
00:04:33,924 --> 00:04:35,556
Oh, it's cancer.

114
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:36,819
Is it cancer? Jodi.

115
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,077
What?

116
00:04:39,146 --> 00:04:40,312
Oh, nothing.

117
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,532
Nothing. Uh, could be minor.

118
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,845
We'll know more
when we get a CT.

119
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:47,635
See? I knew we should
have come in earlier.

120
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:49,015
What did you see? Was it bad?

121
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:50,316
If it was bad, why do
you look so happy?

122
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:51,472
Just get him to CT.

123
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,809
And speak to no
one of this, no one!

124
00:04:57,931 --> 00:05:00,143
You paged me? Hey, Callie.

125
00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:01,645
What happened to my surgery?

126
00:05:01,669 --> 00:05:03,479
I was supposed to remove
the sensors on Will Mitchell,

127
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:05,331
and, uh, I found out my
surgery was canceled.

128
00:05:05,355 --> 00:05:06,599
Yeah, that's why I paged you.

129
00:05:06,623 --> 00:05:09,090
Uh, Dr. Torres came
to me with a concern

130
00:05:09,159 --> 00:05:11,760
about an intellectual-property
conflict between you two.

131
00:05:11,828 --> 00:05:13,055
What, is this about the sensors?

132
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:15,330
Yes, Derek. It's
about our sensors.

133
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:17,265
Look, let's just talk.

134
00:05:17,334 --> 00:05:18,394
I'm sure we can find a solution.

135
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:19,651
Who's this?

136
00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:20,885
Oh, that's Paula.

137
00:05:20,954 --> 00:05:22,170
She's my lawyer.

138
00:05:25,809 --> 00:05:28,643
Is it? Is it?

139
00:05:30,046 --> 00:05:32,263
It is!

140
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:33,698
What?

141
00:05:33,767 --> 00:05:36,868
Look at it, Murphy.
It's glorious.

142
00:05:36,936 --> 00:05:40,016
It's a mass. It's a
massive mass, but...

143
00:05:40,724 --> 00:05:42,457
Oh, my God.

144
00:05:42,526 --> 00:05:44,726
Aah!

145
00:05:44,795 --> 00:05:47,829
Okay, so, we're gonna need
a 3D reconstruction and, um...

146
00:05:47,898 --> 00:05:50,264
Hey, Dr. Bailey. Hey, do
you have the labs on the, um...

147
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:51,544
I said, "Tell no one"! I didn't!

148
00:05:51,568 --> 00:05:54,435
Tell no one what? Is that a...

149
00:05:54,504 --> 00:05:56,754
Yeah! Okay, keep
your voice down.

150
00:05:56,823 --> 00:05:57,823
I want in.

151
00:05:57,874 --> 00:05:58,924
No! It's mine.

152
00:05:58,992 --> 00:06:00,091
It's ours.

153
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,093
Page Dr. Webber. Why him?

154
00:06:02,162 --> 00:06:04,045
It's his birthday.

155
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:05,758
I'll be forwarding your
materials on to Dr. Yang.

156
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:07,627
Thank you, Doctor.
We'll let you know.

157
00:06:07,651 --> 00:06:11,520
Oh. Sorry. Hi. I'm
here for the HLHS trial.

158
00:06:11,588 --> 00:06:12,699
Yes, and you are...

159
00:06:12,723 --> 00:06:13,871
Sheryll Jeffries.

160
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,940
Oh, no, I'm not on the list.

161
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:18,237
That stupid nurse, or whatever
she was, said I didn't qualify.

162
00:06:18,261 --> 00:06:20,211
I'm what you're looking for.

163
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:23,214
HLHS with at least one
failed conduit procedure.

164
00:06:23,283 --> 00:06:24,449
That's me.

165
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:26,496
Ah. I'm sorry, Sheryll.

166
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,131
The study is for pediatric
patients over one.

167
00:06:29,155 --> 00:06:31,089
I'm 17. I am a
pediatric patient.

168
00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:33,502
We're looking for
pre-pubescent specifically,

169
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:34,820
kids that are still growing.

170
00:06:34,844 --> 00:06:36,027
That's perfect.

171
00:06:36,096 --> 00:06:37,890
I just had a huge growth spurt.

172
00:06:37,914 --> 00:06:39,592
This is the first time
since I got knocked up

173
00:06:39,616 --> 00:06:41,666
someone said I'm
too old for something.

174
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:43,835
Look, I'm due in six weeks.

175
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:46,837
I want a heart that's
gonna survive it, okay?

176
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,251
And why do you
need me to look at it?

177
00:06:48,275 --> 00:06:49,618
It's for your birthday.

178
00:06:49,642 --> 00:06:51,788
No more talk about my birthday.

179
00:06:51,812 --> 00:06:54,941
I mean, there are fine surgeons
working well into their 70s,

180
00:06:54,965 --> 00:06:56,042
and I am nowhere near 70.

181
00:06:56,066 --> 00:06:59,333
Will you just look
at the monitor?

182
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:03,488
Monitor.

183
00:07:03,557 --> 00:07:05,806
Let's see. Okay. Well...

184
00:07:06,576 --> 00:07:08,843
Oh, my word.

185
00:07:08,912 --> 00:07:11,212
Is that a little leg?

186
00:07:11,281 --> 00:07:12,513
And a spinal column.

187
00:07:12,582 --> 00:07:13,765
It is.

188
00:07:15,385 --> 00:07:16,684
It's a fetus in fetu.

189
00:07:16,753 --> 00:07:17,785
It is.

190
00:07:17,855 --> 00:07:19,520
The man absorbed his own twin.

191
00:07:19,589 --> 00:07:21,239
He did.

192
00:07:21,308 --> 00:07:22,851
You know, in all my
years, I've never seen one.

193
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:23,953
Neither have I! Neither have I!

194
00:07:23,977 --> 00:07:24,977
Well...

195
00:07:25,045 --> 00:07:26,178
Hot diggity!

196
00:07:26,797 --> 00:07:28,913
Happy birthday.

197
00:07:28,982 --> 00:07:31,032
Ah, look at that. Oh, my.

198
00:07:41,161 --> 00:07:42,393
A love contract?

199
00:07:42,463 --> 00:07:44,712
Where did Grey get this,
Zola's Barbie Dreamhouse?

200
00:07:44,781 --> 00:07:46,658
No. It's a real thing. I swear.

201
00:07:46,682 --> 00:07:50,718
"We confirm that any sexual
and/or romantic relationship

202
00:07:50,787 --> 00:07:54,722
"is completely voluntary."
This is so creepy.

203
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:57,058
Like, we have to vow
to the hospital gods?

204
00:07:57,127 --> 00:07:58,804
Hey, Alex, we have a
transoral fundoplication.

205
00:07:58,828 --> 00:08:00,122
I sent you the latest labs.
- What's that?

206
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:01,612
Oh, it's really, really cool.

207
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:02,863
First, we go in orally,

208
00:08:02,932 --> 00:08:04,577
and then we go in
through the belly button

209
00:08:04,601 --> 00:08:06,767
to fix a kid's reflux
without leaving a scar.

210
00:08:06,836 --> 00:08:08,248
It puts the "fun"
in "fundoplication."

211
00:08:08,272 --> 00:08:09,571
God, that does sound fun.

212
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,867
Yeah. See? You
could get on that.

213
00:08:10,891 --> 00:08:12,702
Just sign that, and you
could be back on peds.

214
00:08:12,726 --> 00:08:15,093
Yeah, I'm not signing that.

215
00:08:18,332 --> 00:08:19,698
I have a twin?

216
00:08:19,766 --> 00:08:21,533
You did in utero.

217
00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:23,078
Oh, gross. He ate his twin?

218
00:08:23,102 --> 00:08:24,302
Absorbed it.

219
00:08:24,371 --> 00:08:25,531
Or rather enveloped it.

220
00:08:25,555 --> 00:08:27,605
Greg, you developed around it.

221
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:29,707
Oh, wow. Oh, wow. Oh,
I'm gonna need a minute.

222
00:08:29,776 --> 00:08:31,738
Is it dangerous? I mean,
can it kill him? Jodi.

223
00:08:31,762 --> 00:08:33,944
No. In... In many
cases, it's harmless,

224
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:36,097
but Greg's is the
source of his pain,

225
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:38,516
so that likely
indicates that it will

226
00:08:38,585 --> 00:08:40,779
cause problems
if it hasn't already.

227
00:08:40,803 --> 00:08:42,070
Good news.

228
00:08:42,138 --> 00:08:43,766
We were able to schedule
surgery today to remove it.

229
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:47,375
Stop calling him "it"!
Everyone needs to slow down.

230
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:49,164
I just found out
I have a brother.

231
00:08:52,132 --> 00:08:53,531
I'm sorry, Sheryll.

232
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,811
I wish I could help
you, but rules are rules.

233
00:08:54,835 --> 00:08:56,167
Just bend them, okay?

234
00:08:56,236 --> 00:08:57,669
I can't.

235
00:08:57,738 --> 00:08:59,532
Sheryll, please, if I could...

236
00:08:59,556 --> 00:09:01,973
My water broke. I think.

237
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:03,541
Oh, boy.

238
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:05,238
I need a wheelchair here!
- I'll get one.

239
00:09:05,262 --> 00:09:06,472
And page labor and delivery!

240
00:09:06,496 --> 00:09:07,762
Right away.

241
00:09:07,831 --> 00:09:09,742
Can I call the baby's
father, your parents?

242
00:09:09,766 --> 00:09:12,400
My parents don't talk to me.
Not sure who the father is,

243
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:14,202
probably why my
parents don't talk to me.

244
00:09:14,271 --> 00:09:16,637
The person you
can call is Dr. Yang.

245
00:09:16,706 --> 00:09:19,173
And tell her to
make an exception.

246
00:09:19,242 --> 00:09:20,758
<i>She's too old.</i>

247
00:09:20,827 --> 00:09:22,638
You need a refresher on
when puberty begins, Ross?

248
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:25,096
I know. I just thought
we could bend the rules.

249
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:26,925
And skew the
results of the trial.

250
00:09:26,949 --> 00:09:28,216
No, but this patient...

251
00:09:28,285 --> 00:09:29,600
I told you.

252
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:30,880
I don't want to know
about the patient,

253
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:32,081
so I'm not influenced.

254
00:09:32,105 --> 00:09:34,505
I only want to see the heart.

255
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,419
A heart that has had
a previous surgery

256
00:09:36,443 --> 00:09:37,709
to correct the defect,

257
00:09:37,778 --> 00:09:39,939
is currently in
poor cardiac health,

258
00:09:39,963 --> 00:09:43,142
and is in the body of a kid
between the ages of one and 12.

259
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:44,577
A heart that is still growing.

260
00:09:44,601 --> 00:09:46,167
Is this that heart?

261
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:55,254
Hey. So, I was thinking about
this whole Internet-dating thing.

262
00:09:55,278 --> 00:09:57,256
<i>It takes five minutes.</i> Wait.
That's why you paged me?

263
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,546
You said this was urgent.

264
00:09:58,614 --> 00:10:01,348
<i>It is. I'm about to get
busy with this trial.</i>

265
00:10:01,417 --> 00:10:05,036
And you need someone to
snuggle with on rainy Seattle nights.

266
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:07,099
Ooh. Say that in your profile.

267
00:10:07,123 --> 00:10:08,367
I Got to go. I got to go.

268
00:10:08,391 --> 00:10:10,053
Callie, this is not
something I'm doing to you.

269
00:10:10,077 --> 00:10:11,354
I have a signed
contract with them.

270
00:10:11,378 --> 00:10:12,977
Yeah, that you
had no right to sign.

271
00:10:13,046 --> 00:10:14,606
You signed away
something that's ours.

272
00:10:14,631 --> 00:10:15,959
Come on. We spent half
the day together yesterday.

273
00:10:15,983 --> 00:10:17,193
We were on a play
date. Why didn't you say...

274
00:10:17,217 --> 00:10:18,416
We were with the kids.

275
00:10:18,485 --> 00:10:19,795
Oh, we have Sofia's dressy doll.

276
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:20,568
I think Zola
thought it was hers.

277
00:10:20,637 --> 00:10:22,081
Ha. What?

278
00:10:22,105 --> 00:10:23,149
Oh, like father, like
daughter, I guess.

279
00:10:23,173 --> 00:10:24,917
I think we're drifting here.

280
00:10:24,941 --> 00:10:26,291
Yes, yes, you're right.

281
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,503
I'm sorry. That
was unprofessional.

282
00:10:27,527 --> 00:10:29,227
What I should have said was,

283
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:31,662
the sensors are materials
that you co-developed with me

284
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:33,480
in service of research I started

285
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:35,283
and invited you
to participate in.

286
00:10:35,351 --> 00:10:37,496
If you attempt to impair my
access to these materials,

287
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,632
I will have you prosecuted
to the fullest extent of the law.

288
00:10:39,656 --> 00:10:41,072
Well said.

289
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:43,958
This is insane. You
don't have a case.

290
00:10:44,044 --> 00:10:46,084
Listen, before anyone
resorts to litigation,

291
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:48,613
let me just take this before
the other board members.

292
00:10:48,682 --> 00:10:52,099
Maybe we can find a solution
that is fair to both parties.

293
00:10:52,168 --> 00:10:55,019
In the meantime, I want you
both to leave this matter alone

294
00:10:55,088 --> 00:10:56,454
until you hear from me.

295
00:10:56,523 --> 00:10:58,523
All right?

296
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:01,604
I'm sure it was a shock.
I mean, I was shocked.

297
00:11:01,628 --> 00:11:03,572
I can't even imagine
what you must be feeling.

298
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:05,508
Actually, I can. I can
imagine it because I...

299
00:11:05,532 --> 00:11:07,782
You know what? Babe,
don't. She doesn't care.

300
00:11:07,851 --> 00:11:09,250
But I know why you're here, Mom,

301
00:11:09,319 --> 00:11:10,696
and I could have
saved you a trip.

302
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,864
I already called Mike Farris.

303
00:11:11,888 --> 00:11:14,055
The time to call
Mike would have been

304
00:11:14,123 --> 00:11:16,190
before you stood
up at that barn.

305
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:17,753
Wait, who is Mike Harris?

306
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:19,555
"Farris". He's our
attorney. Avery Foundation.

307
00:11:19,579 --> 00:11:21,262
Protects our
financial interests.

308
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:25,449
Um, are you suggesting
that I'm after your money?

309
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:27,769
I have no idea what
you're after, dear.

310
00:11:27,838 --> 00:11:29,354
All right, that's enough.

311
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:31,000
You're not gonna march in here

312
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:32,501
and start questioning
my wife's character.

313
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,292
You want to talk
about her character?

314
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:36,227
She left a man at the altar.

315
00:11:36,296 --> 00:11:38,312
She broke his heart
and humiliated him

316
00:11:38,381 --> 00:11:40,347
in front of everyone
that he loves.

317
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:43,367
I have no idea what she's
capable of, never mind you.

318
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:45,820
I am not interested
in your money.

319
00:11:45,889 --> 00:11:47,338
Wonderful.

320
00:11:47,407 --> 00:11:49,018
That's what I said when I
married into the Avery family,

321
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:50,242
and you know what I did next?

322
00:11:50,277 --> 00:11:52,259
I signed a prenuptial agreement.

323
00:11:52,329 --> 00:11:53,539
I said I'd handle it.

324
00:11:53,563 --> 00:11:54,907
This is totally inappropriate.

325
00:11:54,931 --> 00:11:57,031
What's inappropriate
is the engagement

326
00:11:57,099 --> 00:11:59,701
was 15 minutes at a
rest stop on the turnpike.

327
00:11:59,769 --> 00:12:02,203
Fortunately,
postnuptial agreements

328
00:12:02,271 --> 00:12:04,638
were created for
moments like this.

329
00:12:04,707 --> 00:12:07,058
And this meeting is over.

330
00:12:07,127 --> 00:12:08,187
Jackson. It's over!

331
00:12:08,211 --> 00:12:09,511
Look at this. I...

332
00:12:18,371 --> 00:12:21,773
I'll sign the stupid paper.
Really, I don't mind.

333
00:12:21,842 --> 00:12:23,435
You're not signing
anything. Why not?

334
00:12:23,459 --> 00:12:25,560
I don't want your
money. I want you.

335
00:12:25,629 --> 00:12:26,772
A prenup or
whatever the hell it is

336
00:12:26,796 --> 00:12:28,040
is only for if we get divorced,

337
00:12:28,064 --> 00:12:29,158
which we're not gonna
do, so it doesn't matter.

338
00:12:29,182 --> 00:12:31,060
April, that is not
the point, okay?

339
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:33,596
This is a conversation for
you and I when we are ready,

340
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,230
not for her to come
barging in dictating terms.

341
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:37,272
But it will calm her down.

342
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,784
I'm part of her family now.

343
00:12:38,808 --> 00:12:40,052
I don't think an olive branch

344
00:12:40,076 --> 00:12:41,703
is the worst thing
in the world to offer.

345
00:12:41,727 --> 00:12:42,660
Yeah, well, you're a
better person than I am.

346
00:12:42,728 --> 00:12:44,028
Well, yes.

347
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:45,346
And than she is.

348
00:12:45,415 --> 00:12:46,655
I'm better than everyone.

349
00:12:49,569 --> 00:12:54,088
Mmm-mmm. Not right now.
We can let her stew for a while.

350
00:12:54,157 --> 00:12:55,456
Wait, wait, wait.

351
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:56,765
Come on.

352
00:12:56,826 --> 00:12:57,937
I hate you.

353
00:12:57,961 --> 00:12:59,822
I know, right? Do
you want to see?

354
00:12:59,846 --> 00:13:03,147
No. I want to work
on that printer.

355
00:13:03,216 --> 00:13:05,010
And it's my job to
make sure he doesn't.

356
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:06,528
Seriously? Yeah. Don't...

357
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:09,770
That's what you're
doing instead of this.

358
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:11,238
Oh, come on!

359
00:13:11,307 --> 00:13:12,589
All right. What is that?

360
00:13:12,658 --> 00:13:14,058
Okay.

361
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:16,694
Have you ever, ever
seen anything like this?

362
00:13:16,762 --> 00:13:20,131
Oh, holy God! No, I never
wanted to! What is that?

363
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,582
It's a fetus in a fetus.

364
00:13:21,651 --> 00:13:22,995
That I am down here not seeing.

365
00:13:23,019 --> 00:13:24,663
I can totally read
without supervision.

366
00:13:24,687 --> 00:13:26,699
Been doing it for years.
That's not reading.

367
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:28,139
That's doodling. Read.

368
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:30,058
Well...

369
00:13:30,126 --> 00:13:32,121
This has been fun, but I have
to take a man out of a man.

370
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:34,025
Want another peak?
I'm good, actually.

371
00:13:36,349 --> 00:13:39,900
That. How would it
work? Theoretically.

372
00:13:42,272 --> 00:13:43,932
Let's go. Keep it
moving, people.

373
00:13:43,956 --> 00:13:45,785
Everybody needs to take a look,

374
00:13:45,809 --> 00:13:50,128
because this, my friends, is the
Halley's Comet of your careers,

375
00:13:50,196 --> 00:13:54,165
as rare, wondrous
and fleeting...

376
00:13:54,234 --> 00:13:57,034
Dr. Hunt. Can I help
you with something?

377
00:13:57,103 --> 00:13:58,330
Yeah, I just came
to have a look.

378
00:13:58,354 --> 00:14:00,499
You know there's a line.

379
00:14:00,523 --> 00:14:04,258
You're... You're serious?

380
00:14:04,327 --> 00:14:06,894
I'm deadly serious.

381
00:14:06,963 --> 00:14:10,398
These kids want to
learn. Back of the line.

382
00:14:13,169 --> 00:14:14,249
Thank you.

383
00:14:14,304 --> 00:14:17,054
Now, you notice
that the absorbed twin

384
00:14:17,123 --> 00:14:19,724
gets its blood supply
from the renal artery.

385
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:23,110
First glance, nothing special.

386
00:14:23,179 --> 00:14:26,231
Take a second look,
and the <i>Mona Lisa.</i>

387
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:28,327
We will start by cutting
through the adhesions.

388
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,428
Once that occurs...

389
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:30,492
We're not taking him out.

390
00:14:31,988 --> 00:14:33,204
What do you mean?

391
00:14:33,273 --> 00:14:34,405
You heard the man.

392
00:14:34,474 --> 00:14:36,908
My little twin is an
incredibly rare find.

393
00:14:36,977 --> 00:14:38,710
Uh, yes.

394
00:14:38,778 --> 00:14:42,964
Yes, it is, Greg, but it
still has to come out.

395
00:14:43,033 --> 00:14:45,550
You want to destroy
the <i>Mona Lisa?</i>

396
00:14:45,619 --> 00:14:48,752
No. I won't sign the consent.

397
00:14:54,461 --> 00:14:56,004
I mean, you're
fixing baby hearts,

398
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:57,506
Derek's mapping
the brain, and I'm...

399
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:59,397
Have the most
amazing surgery ever.

400
00:14:59,466 --> 00:15:01,043
I mean, please, tell
me this is pressing.

401
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:02,517
Nowhere near the heart.

402
00:15:03,586 --> 00:15:05,353
Hey. Did you see this?

403
00:15:05,421 --> 00:15:08,672
Oh, that the absorbed twin?
Technically, that's a peds case.

404
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,942
Back off. It's
the reason I live.

405
00:15:11,011 --> 00:15:14,178
Aw, she's mopey 'cause she
let a lab rat loose in her lab.

406
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:15,679
Boo-hoo. You
gonna eat that bacon?

407
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:17,727
No, it's like leaving your
kids with a babysitter.

408
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:20,012
I mean, you say, "Put the kids
to bed at 7:00," but will they?

409
00:15:20,036 --> 00:15:22,064
Or will they drink all
your tequila, pass out,

410
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:23,715
leave the gas on, the
whole house blows up

411
00:15:23,739 --> 00:15:25,105
and everybody dies?

412
00:15:25,175 --> 00:15:28,142
Okay. What do you think
of her? She's hot, right?

413
00:15:28,211 --> 00:15:29,504
Have you given up on men?

414
00:15:29,528 --> 00:15:30,768
No, for Owen.

415
00:15:30,797 --> 00:15:33,164
There is this
Internet-dating site.

416
00:15:33,233 --> 00:15:35,553
There are pages
of women like this.

417
00:15:35,585 --> 00:15:37,663
Owen should be
doing this, right? Yes.

418
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:39,148
Why don't you just
keep banging him?

419
00:15:39,172 --> 00:15:40,821
At least it's legal
for you guys.

420
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:42,934
You know, Jo's not gonna sign
that stupid love contract you gave me.

421
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:44,258
Why not?

422
00:15:44,327 --> 00:15:45,871
Oh, I don't know.
Because it's stupid.

423
00:15:45,895 --> 00:15:47,406
I knew I shouldn't
have given it to her.

424
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:49,525
Just tell her it's just a
stupid piece of paper.

425
00:15:49,549 --> 00:15:51,482
Yeah, if she runs,
I'm blaming you.

426
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:52,650
She looks like she's 20.

427
00:15:52,719 --> 00:15:53,751
She's cute.

428
00:15:54,854 --> 00:15:56,170
I hate your husband.

429
00:15:56,238 --> 00:15:57,332
Owen said not to talk about it.

430
00:15:57,356 --> 00:15:58,567
I'm not. I'm talking to myself.

431
00:15:58,591 --> 00:16:00,431
I hate Derek
Shepherd. Really? Why?

432
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,271
Oh, 'cause he's an
arrogant, stealing bastard.

433
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:04,728
I totally agree.

434
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:06,308
Do you ladies think she's hot?

435
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:07,498
Yeah, very.

436
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:09,000
And now, I hate you.

437
00:16:11,755 --> 00:16:13,721
Nice. Oh.

438
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:16,157
Oh, no, no, no,
no, no. I got to go.

439
00:16:18,178 --> 00:16:19,610
What did you do?

440
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:21,073
He talked the
man out of surgery.

441
00:16:21,097 --> 00:16:23,113
Now, he loves
his little brother,

442
00:16:23,183 --> 00:16:24,793
can't bear to part with him.

443
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,350
What?

444
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:28,080
I was explaining the
uniqueness of his condition.

445
00:16:28,104 --> 00:16:31,655
Apparently, my
words cast a spell. Ah!

446
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:34,086
Okay, so, now, what do we tell
him? How do we get him back?

447
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:36,488
Tell him it could have adverse
effects on his blood pressure.

448
00:16:36,512 --> 00:16:37,612
Tell him it could explode.

449
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,941
Tell him it's a demon.
Oh, that's good.

450
00:16:38,965 --> 00:16:41,298
Okay, stop! I ruined it.

451
00:16:41,368 --> 00:16:42,628
I'll fix it. I'll talk to him.

452
00:16:42,652 --> 00:16:43,728
What are you gonna say?

453
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:44,872
I don't know!

454
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,245
I'm coming with you.

455
00:16:47,306 --> 00:16:49,666
This is the worst birthday ever.

456
00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:52,259
Oh, hey. Hey, did
you talk to Dr. Yang?

457
00:16:52,328 --> 00:16:54,061
Ow! Sweet, geez.

458
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:56,146
What did she say? She...

459
00:16:56,216 --> 00:16:57,915
She didn't say.

460
00:16:58,651 --> 00:17:00,017
She was busy.

461
00:17:00,086 --> 00:17:01,352
Oh, damn.

462
00:17:01,421 --> 00:17:04,588
She said no. She said no.

463
00:17:04,657 --> 00:17:05,956
Oh...

464
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:09,093
Look, they said
I'd be dead by 15.

465
00:17:09,162 --> 00:17:11,195
I... I dropped out
of high school.

466
00:17:11,264 --> 00:17:13,397
I hitchhiked. I had sex.

467
00:17:13,466 --> 00:17:16,200
I'm having this baby because
I thought I was gonna die.

468
00:17:16,269 --> 00:17:18,752
Now that it's coming,
I really want to live.

469
00:17:18,821 --> 00:17:20,905
I want the chance to be her mom.

470
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:23,474
So, can you please
bring Dr. Yang in here,

471
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:25,092
so I can talk to her, please?

472
00:17:25,161 --> 00:17:26,877
For my baby. Oh!

473
00:17:26,946 --> 00:17:28,257
Okay, okay, breathe.

474
00:17:28,281 --> 00:17:29,513
I am breathing!

475
00:17:34,671 --> 00:17:37,071
Hey. What are you do... Shh.

476
00:17:37,974 --> 00:17:39,674
What are you doing?

477
00:17:39,742 --> 00:17:41,419
Webber's post-ops.

478
00:17:41,443 --> 00:17:45,646
Since he got the
fetus in fetu, I get this.

479
00:17:45,715 --> 00:17:47,615
Well, I'm heading in
to do the fundoplication,

480
00:17:47,684 --> 00:17:50,934
and you'd be there,
too, if you were in peds.

481
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:52,470
No.

482
00:17:52,539 --> 00:17:54,817
Okay, look, I thought it was
nuts when Mer gave it to me,

483
00:17:54,841 --> 00:17:56,373
and I knew you'd hate it, too.

484
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:58,670
But, honest to God, it's just
a piece of paper that says...

485
00:17:58,694 --> 00:18:01,189
It's a legal document,
Alex, so it's not just...

486
00:18:01,213 --> 00:18:03,614
What is your problem?

487
00:18:03,683 --> 00:18:06,378
In my experience, you sign
papers, and it's a kiss of death.

488
00:18:06,402 --> 00:18:07,880
You sign a marriage license,

489
00:18:07,904 --> 00:18:09,381
and the romance goes away.

490
00:18:09,405 --> 00:18:11,772
She signed a DNR two days ago.

491
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,175
Guess what. She's using it.

492
00:18:14,243 --> 00:18:17,344
Hey, Alex. Our guy's
being prepped. Ooh.

493
00:18:17,413 --> 00:18:18,695
For what?

494
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:20,109
Our fundoplication.

495
00:18:20,133 --> 00:18:22,950
Is that the cool transoral
thing? Cutting-edge?

496
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:26,003
Only being done in a few
top-level peds-surg programs?

497
00:18:26,072 --> 00:18:28,071
Yeah, that's the one.

498
00:18:28,141 --> 00:18:30,107
Okay. Let's do it.

499
00:18:35,064 --> 00:18:36,430
I'm not talking to you.

500
00:18:36,499 --> 00:18:38,210
Okay, then just listen.

501
00:18:38,234 --> 00:18:40,729
If you understood what the
brain-mapping project can do,

502
00:18:40,753 --> 00:18:42,097
you would share your technology.

503
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:46,256
Oh, share? I'm sharing
now? You're stealing it.

504
00:18:46,325 --> 00:18:48,325
You're stealing it.

505
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:51,195
Callie, the brain

506
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:55,499
has more nerve cells
than humans on earth.

507
00:18:55,568 --> 00:18:58,531
We want to understand
how all those neurons interact,

508
00:18:58,555 --> 00:19:00,098
so we're gonna start
with a smaller group,

509
00:19:00,122 --> 00:19:02,406
like everybody
here in the hospital.

510
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:06,343
And we're gonna determine how
they interact with each other and talk.

511
00:19:06,412 --> 00:19:08,424
Please, stop. Stop patronizing
me... And then we move out.

512
00:19:08,448 --> 00:19:10,692
You're just saying that your
thing is more important than mine.

513
00:19:10,716 --> 00:19:12,661
I'm saying my thing
feeds your thing.

514
00:19:12,685 --> 00:19:15,564
It will revolutionize our understanding
of what it means to be human.

515
00:19:15,588 --> 00:19:16,898
And yet, you would have
never had the sensors

516
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:18,806
if it weren't for my
thing, you selfish...

517
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:20,474
Selfish?

518
00:19:20,543 --> 00:19:23,493
Here! Let me show you a diagram.

519
00:19:23,562 --> 00:19:25,929
This is you.

520
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:27,509
I'm an asterisk? No.

521
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:31,602
You think you are the
white-hot center of the universe.

522
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:35,656
Also, it looks like a
butthole. Either way, it works.

523
00:19:41,413 --> 00:19:43,492
Sheryll, this is Dr. Yang.

524
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:44,882
Oh, hi. Dr. Yang.

525
00:19:44,951 --> 00:19:46,595
I'd hug you, but... Ow!

526
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:49,414
Just breathe. I can
wait. No, I'm fine.

527
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:51,584
Uh, my doctor wanted to
put me on a transplant list,

528
00:19:51,608 --> 00:19:53,819
but I heard about your
success with Baby Nathan.

529
00:19:53,843 --> 00:19:55,521
Oh.

530
00:19:55,545 --> 00:19:58,763
Dr. Ross, this is the patient
you already spoke to me about.

531
00:19:58,815 --> 00:20:00,625
Listen, I know you're
only looking for little kids,

532
00:20:00,649 --> 00:20:03,050
but can you please,
just... Please! Ah!

533
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:06,604
You know, just let
me take a listen here.

534
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:09,072
Oh, my goodness.
Thank you so much.

535
00:20:12,227 --> 00:20:15,996
You have a slight murmur,
but besides that, you are well.

536
00:20:16,064 --> 00:20:18,365
Your OB will monitor
your cardiac function,

537
00:20:18,434 --> 00:20:20,935
and page me if there
are any complications.

538
00:20:21,003 --> 00:20:22,869
Good luck.

539
00:20:22,938 --> 00:20:24,838
Dr. Ross, a minute?

540
00:20:28,294 --> 00:20:30,622
I'm sorry. She just really wanted
to have a chance to plead her case.

541
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:32,445
That was out of
line. I already said no.

542
00:20:32,515 --> 00:20:33,892
I know it was wrong. I'm sorry.

543
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:37,668
She doesn't meet the
criteria. It's that simple.

544
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:40,871
I know it's hard because
they're kids and they're dying.

545
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:43,474
And they've got their
stories and lives and family...

546
00:20:43,526 --> 00:20:44,726
Well, she doesn't!

547
00:20:44,793 --> 00:20:45,871
Her parents don't talk to her.

548
00:20:45,895 --> 00:20:46,911
Ross, stop it!

549
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:48,323
You're too emotionally involved,

550
00:20:48,347 --> 00:20:49,647
and you've gotten her hopes up.

551
00:20:49,699 --> 00:20:52,299
It's gonna be worse on
her when you tell her no.

552
00:20:55,888 --> 00:20:57,721
Do your job.

553
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:00,352
Do you have my discharge papers?

554
00:21:00,376 --> 00:21:01,775
Uh.

555
00:21:01,844 --> 00:21:04,578
No. No, no, I don't. I think
you need to reconsider.

556
00:21:04,664 --> 00:21:06,714
You need to have this
thing removed, Greg.

557
00:21:06,782 --> 00:21:09,027
Dr. Webber, you said
it was incredibly rare.

558
00:21:09,051 --> 00:21:10,483
And it's mine.

559
00:21:10,552 --> 00:21:12,130
People chuck stuff all the time,

560
00:21:12,154 --> 00:21:14,833
no clue of the value of the
thing that they're throwing away.

561
00:21:14,857 --> 00:21:17,468
Finding treasure in
their trash is what I do.

562
00:21:17,492 --> 00:21:21,161
And I didn't have to dig through
anyone's yard-sale crap to find this.

563
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:23,158
It was inside of me all along.

564
00:21:23,182 --> 00:21:25,327
This is a wad of
bones and teeth.

565
00:21:25,351 --> 00:21:28,419
It's not some crummy
box of VHS tapes.

566
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:29,647
We've talked about this.

567
00:21:29,671 --> 00:21:31,967
Analog's coming
back in a big way.

568
00:21:31,991 --> 00:21:34,035
Just because it's rare
doesn't mean it has value.

569
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:36,477
A heart has value.
A liver has value.

570
00:21:36,546 --> 00:21:39,180
Actually, I'm on
Greg's side here.

571
00:21:39,248 --> 00:21:40,597
No, you're not.

572
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:42,633
People do throw
things away too easily.

573
00:21:42,702 --> 00:21:44,935
They throw out
people just like that.

574
00:21:45,004 --> 00:21:47,516
They're done with you, and then
they throw you out with the trash.

575
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:49,218
Sir... I'm not gonna
do that, Greg.

576
00:21:49,242 --> 00:21:50,769
Stop! Yeah, stop.

577
00:21:50,793 --> 00:21:53,660
Okay, Greg, I have
a proposition for you.

578
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:55,712
You let me remove
this fetus in fetu,

579
00:21:55,781 --> 00:21:58,649
and I promise you I
won't throw it in the trash.

580
00:21:58,718 --> 00:22:00,801
I'll throw it in a jar, and
you can take it home.

581
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:02,686
You aren't serious.

582
00:22:02,755 --> 00:22:04,633
It'll look a hell of a lot better
on a shelf than in your belly.

583
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:06,497
And you won't have
that pain anymore.

584
00:22:07,026 --> 00:22:08,275
You can do that?

585
00:22:08,361 --> 00:22:09,994
I do it all the time.

586
00:22:10,063 --> 00:22:11,812
It comes down to this.

587
00:22:11,881 --> 00:22:14,147
My research is just
as important as yours.

588
00:22:14,216 --> 00:22:15,794
You're talking about
microscopic neurons.

589
00:22:15,818 --> 00:22:17,863
I'm talking about giving a
person the ability to walk again.

590
00:22:17,887 --> 00:22:19,119
It's just as important!

591
00:22:19,188 --> 00:22:20,465
And you wouldn't
have come up with

592
00:22:20,489 --> 00:22:22,089
the sensors if it
wasn't for my work.

593
00:22:22,124 --> 00:22:24,925
The sensors were an answer
to a question that I asked you.

594
00:22:24,994 --> 00:22:26,538
It was my answer! What...

595
00:22:26,562 --> 00:22:28,406
Don't fight this, Callie.
You don't want to.

596
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:30,614
Oh, why, 'cause you have
government lawyers now?

597
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:33,184
I'm not gonna be bullied.
You don't have a case!

598
00:22:33,252 --> 00:22:35,263
My name is on the material,
and my name is on the patents.

599
00:22:35,287 --> 00:22:36,781
They're mine. You can
hear it from me now.

600
00:22:36,805 --> 00:22:39,840
Or you can hear it
from a judge in court.

601
00:22:39,908 --> 00:22:42,387
My suggestion is to save
your time and money.

602
00:22:42,411 --> 00:22:45,362
Listen to me as your friend.

603
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:51,618
I'm sorry. I feel terrible.

604
00:22:51,687 --> 00:22:55,522
There's a reason
you feel terrible.

605
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:57,436
It's 'cause it's the wrong
thing to do, and you know it.

606
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:58,837
You're not used to
answering to people,

607
00:22:58,861 --> 00:23:00,072
and now, you have the President

608
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:01,223
himself calling
you on the phone.

609
00:23:01,247 --> 00:23:04,448
And you're afraid to say no

610
00:23:04,516 --> 00:23:08,052
even though you know
this is 100% wrong.

611
00:23:10,223 --> 00:23:13,224
You're a good person.
That's why you feel bad.

612
00:23:13,292 --> 00:23:14,591
'Cause you should.

613
00:23:17,162 --> 00:23:18,912
Down to seven. That's fast.

614
00:23:18,981 --> 00:23:22,249
I know what I want. Uh,
did you do the profile?

615
00:23:22,318 --> 00:23:24,901
What? The dating thing? No, no.

616
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:27,065
Cristina, I've spent my
morning trying to figure out

617
00:23:27,089 --> 00:23:30,340
a way to fix this thing
between Torres and Shepherd.

618
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:33,444
I haven't had time.
Sit. I'll do it for you.

619
00:23:33,513 --> 00:23:34,812
Describe yourself.

620
00:23:34,881 --> 00:23:36,179
No. Stubborn.

621
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:37,593
Listen, I'm not being
stubborn. I'm just...

622
00:23:37,617 --> 00:23:38,882
Smart, athletic.

623
00:23:38,951 --> 00:23:40,200
Listen, I'm too busy to...

624
00:23:40,269 --> 00:23:43,070
"A busy professional
seeks..." What?

625
00:23:43,139 --> 00:23:44,772
Nothing. I seek nothing.

626
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,041
Ah, "seeks same,

627
00:23:47,109 --> 00:23:49,087
"someone who is
passionate about her work,

628
00:23:49,111 --> 00:23:51,912
"someone who's..."
Come on. What?

629
00:23:51,981 --> 00:23:53,446
Fine. Fine.

630
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:57,384
Um... Someone who
doesn't care to cook

631
00:23:57,452 --> 00:24:01,105
or get out of bed when
it's not a work day.

632
00:24:01,173 --> 00:24:05,408
Someone who sleeps
so soundly and peacefully,

633
00:24:05,477 --> 00:24:08,696
that I have to check
her pulse sometimes.

634
00:24:12,234 --> 00:24:17,404
Someone who's suffered
and understands suffering.

635
00:24:17,472 --> 00:24:19,450
I'd keep it more upbeat.

636
00:24:19,474 --> 00:24:22,593
To the point that I
don't have to say a word.

637
00:24:22,662 --> 00:24:27,964
She just looks at me and
sees who I am and how I feel.

638
00:24:29,669 --> 00:24:31,335
And accepts it.

639
00:24:31,404 --> 00:24:35,339
You know, she doesn't try to
change it, doesn't want to change it.

640
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:38,609
That person.

641
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:45,316
There's a billion
people out there.

642
00:24:45,384 --> 00:24:48,452
But I imagine,
there's only one her.

643
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,201
I am happy to sign the document.

644
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:06,102
That's wonderful.

645
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,913
I don't have a pen.

646
00:25:16,982 --> 00:25:19,850
No, sweetheart, you
don't actually sign it here.

647
00:25:19,918 --> 00:25:21,518
You review it with your lawyer,

648
00:25:21,587 --> 00:25:25,088
and he will then confer
with our family lawyer.

649
00:25:25,157 --> 00:25:27,324
I... I will consult a lawyer.

650
00:25:27,393 --> 00:25:30,860
Good. Now, let's talk
about the children.

651
00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:32,646
Oh, my God.

652
00:25:32,714 --> 00:25:34,398
Will you have children? Yes.

653
00:25:34,467 --> 00:25:37,868
Yes. Yes. I said, "Yes."

654
00:25:37,936 --> 00:25:40,114
In what religious tradition
will they be raised?

655
00:25:40,138 --> 00:25:41,588
We don't know.

656
00:25:41,657 --> 00:25:43,768
We haven't talked about
what religious tradition

657
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:46,771
we will or won't raise our
theoretical children in yet.

658
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:49,295
That's a conversation
you might want to have.

659
00:25:49,364 --> 00:25:52,460
Avery children become Avery
Foundation board members.

660
00:25:52,484 --> 00:25:57,070
The foundation controls
$480 million in charitable funds

661
00:25:57,139 --> 00:25:58,950
for the advancement of medicine.

662
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:00,407
What? Yeah.

663
00:26:00,476 --> 00:26:03,243
Your children, when they are 15,

664
00:26:03,312 --> 00:26:05,912
will start sitting in on
board meetings, you know,

665
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:08,649
begin to learn the
business, like Jackson did.

666
00:26:08,717 --> 00:26:12,719
When they are 18, they
will gain a seat on the board.

667
00:26:12,787 --> 00:26:15,989
They will be voting members.

668
00:26:16,058 --> 00:26:20,393
You are a born-again Christian,
who I presume is pro-life.

669
00:26:20,462 --> 00:26:21,628
That's right.

670
00:26:21,697 --> 00:26:23,408
Will your children
be taught that

671
00:26:23,432 --> 00:26:25,110
people who are
pro-choice go to hell

672
00:26:25,134 --> 00:26:27,729
or their pro-choice father is
going to hell or their grandmother?

673
00:26:27,753 --> 00:26:29,264
Wait. Whoa!

674
00:26:29,288 --> 00:26:30,732
I don't think anyone
is going to hell.

675
00:26:30,756 --> 00:26:32,756
It's so much more
complicated than that.

676
00:26:32,825 --> 00:26:35,804
Will they stop supporting
medical institutions

677
00:26:35,828 --> 00:26:38,746
that perform abortions
or provide information

678
00:26:38,814 --> 00:26:41,415
about abortions like, for
example, this hospital?

679
00:26:41,484 --> 00:26:44,780
Will they vote to stop
supporting stem-cell research?

680
00:26:44,804 --> 00:26:46,447
We'd all like to think that
the problem at the table

681
00:26:46,471 --> 00:26:47,949
is the meddling mother-in-law

682
00:26:47,973 --> 00:26:50,540
who didn't get to walk
her son down the aisle,

683
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:53,209
but I have built a
massive institution

684
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:56,196
with my blood and my
sweat, and you will inherit it.

685
00:26:56,265 --> 00:26:59,032
And, one day, your
children will control it.

686
00:26:59,101 --> 00:27:01,384
And I don't get the
impression that either of you

687
00:27:01,454 --> 00:27:05,221
has given a moment's
thought to what that means!

688
00:27:09,027 --> 00:27:11,295
Hello, little brother.

689
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:15,860
I see a finger. No,
two... Three fingers.

690
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:18,368
Gross! Where?

691
00:27:18,421 --> 00:27:19,597
He just wants
to try the printer.

692
00:27:19,621 --> 00:27:20,715
Why does he need to?

693
00:27:20,739 --> 00:27:22,206
Because it's why he's here.

694
00:27:22,274 --> 00:27:23,835
And as long as you
won't let him do anything,

695
00:27:23,859 --> 00:27:25,192
I can't be in here.

696
00:27:25,261 --> 00:27:26,501
Tell him I said no.

697
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,597
Is... Is that an ear?

698
00:27:30,666 --> 00:27:31,810
- No. That's a lung.
- That's a lung.

699
00:27:31,834 --> 00:27:33,233
But that is a tooth.

700
00:27:33,302 --> 00:27:34,668
It's a tooth.

701
00:27:34,737 --> 00:27:37,604
And that is a spinal column.

702
00:27:37,673 --> 00:27:39,534
Look! Every damn vertebrae.

703
00:27:39,558 --> 00:27:41,870
I still want to know what
you said to get him to consent.

704
00:27:41,894 --> 00:27:44,194
He promised him a doggy bag.

705
00:27:44,764 --> 00:27:45,996
You didn't.

706
00:27:46,065 --> 00:27:47,665
I did.

707
00:27:48,717 --> 00:27:50,061
He's right. It's part of him.

708
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:52,047
He should be able
to have it and share it.

709
00:27:52,071 --> 00:27:56,523
This is of great medical
interest. That's valuable.

710
00:27:56,592 --> 00:27:58,708
You don't hide it inside

711
00:27:58,777 --> 00:28:04,465
of some basement
or let it rot away.

712
00:28:04,533 --> 00:28:05,773
You share it.

713
00:28:05,801 --> 00:28:07,612
You let people benefit from it,

714
00:28:07,636 --> 00:28:11,855
because, if you do, you can
change the face of medicine.

715
00:28:11,924 --> 00:28:13,819
Oh, my God, I'm gonna say
this to you for the last time.

716
00:28:13,843 --> 00:28:17,394
All right. This relationship is not
new. This decision was not rash.

717
00:28:17,463 --> 00:28:20,408
You only feel that way because
you didn't get to weigh in on it.

718
00:28:20,432 --> 00:28:22,099
Because you didn't
include me in it,

719
00:28:22,168 --> 00:28:23,750
like everything
else in your life.

720
00:28:23,818 --> 00:28:25,097
I don't need to include you!

721
00:28:25,121 --> 00:28:26,431
You include yourself
in everything always!

722
00:28:26,455 --> 00:28:28,049
Stop! Oh, stop it!
Stop it, both of you!

723
00:28:28,073 --> 00:28:29,223
April, sweetheart, don't...

724
00:28:29,291 --> 00:28:31,375
No, stop it!

725
00:28:31,444 --> 00:28:33,910
You're right.

726
00:28:33,979 --> 00:28:35,590
There are a lot of things
we still haven't figured out,

727
00:28:35,614 --> 00:28:37,897
but we will figure them
out, Jackson and I.

728
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:40,334
But if you think
that I am judging you

729
00:28:40,402 --> 00:28:42,702
or anyone because of my beliefs,

730
00:28:42,771 --> 00:28:45,705
then I'm... I'm so
sorry because I'm not.

731
00:28:45,774 --> 00:28:47,540
That is not me.

732
00:28:47,609 --> 00:28:50,421
And I would love to talk to
you about that sometime,

733
00:28:50,445 --> 00:28:53,597
but if it's our children that
you are so concerned about,

734
00:28:53,666 --> 00:28:55,010
if they disagree with
you on some things,

735
00:28:55,034 --> 00:28:58,279
if that's not okay with
you, then I don't know.

736
00:28:58,303 --> 00:28:59,380
Restructure the board?

737
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:00,515
I'm making this up.

738
00:29:00,539 --> 00:29:02,250
I have no idea how
it works. Clearly.

739
00:29:02,274 --> 00:29:05,019
Look, the point is, there
will be a way to figure it out.

740
00:29:05,043 --> 00:29:07,510
We did something
that wasn't responsible,

741
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:09,524
but we did it because
we love each other

742
00:29:09,548 --> 00:29:12,460
and we want to spend every
day together until we die.

743
00:29:12,484 --> 00:29:13,662
I am sorry.

744
00:29:13,686 --> 00:29:14,829
No, you don't have
to apologize to her.

745
00:29:14,853 --> 00:29:18,121
I do. I do. We got married.

746
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:19,668
We had a wedding,
and all she got

747
00:29:19,692 --> 00:29:22,943
was a phone call
after it was over.

748
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:26,646
If our kids do that, I will kill
them with my bare hands.

749
00:29:26,715 --> 00:29:28,982
We made a huge mess.

750
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:31,651
We hurt Matthew,
and we hurt Stephanie.

751
00:29:33,088 --> 00:29:34,654
And we hurt you.

752
00:29:36,074 --> 00:29:38,609
And I am so sorry.

753
00:29:38,677 --> 00:29:40,322
And I'm gonna spend the next,

754
00:29:40,346 --> 00:29:42,826
I don't know how many years,
trying to make it up to you.

755
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:47,583
Apologize to your mom.

756
00:29:49,387 --> 00:29:50,621
Come on.

757
00:29:57,496 --> 00:29:58,628
Can you stand up?

758
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:09,367
What the hell were you thinking?

759
00:30:09,391 --> 00:30:10,602
I love her.

760
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,000
Mom.

761
00:30:13,862 --> 00:30:15,695
And I am sorry.

762
00:30:17,032 --> 00:30:19,032
But I love her.

763
00:30:20,669 --> 00:30:22,636
She's the one.

764
00:30:22,704 --> 00:30:26,606
You could have had
Grandma's cake topper.

765
00:30:26,675 --> 00:30:28,308
It's Limoges.

766
00:30:28,376 --> 00:30:29,943
I know. I know.

767
00:30:31,113 --> 00:30:32,993
I'm sure it's lovely.

768
00:30:33,348 --> 00:30:34,348
Ow.

769
00:30:34,917 --> 00:30:36,127
Okay.

770
00:30:40,555 --> 00:30:41,917
Can't do it! It hurts.

771
00:30:41,941 --> 00:30:43,318
The epidural's
worn off, Sheryll.

772
00:30:43,342 --> 00:30:44,535
You've really got
to start pushing.

773
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:46,959
I can't. I'm trying. I
swear I can't do it.

774
00:30:47,012 --> 00:30:48,890
God, I just want my mama!

775
00:30:48,914 --> 00:30:50,959
Somebody, please, call my mom!

776
00:30:50,983 --> 00:30:52,943
Ah! Sheryll, your
baby's almost here.

777
00:30:52,967 --> 00:30:54,901
Just hang in there. I can't!

778
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:56,948
I can't. Can you
please call her?

779
00:30:56,972 --> 00:30:58,372
Tell her I'm really sorry,

780
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,318
and I need her
really, really badly.

781
00:31:00,342 --> 00:31:02,509
I can't do it. I just
need my mama.

782
00:31:02,594 --> 00:31:03,988
Her blood pressure's
skyrocketing.

783
00:31:04,012 --> 00:31:05,106
Prep an OR for a C-section.

784
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:06,296
We'll call your mom, okay?

785
00:31:06,365 --> 00:31:07,892
But you're gonna have
to do this on your own.

786
00:31:07,916 --> 00:31:10,133
I know you can. Just push.

787
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:15,138
Come on, Sheryll. Push.

788
00:31:16,909 --> 00:31:18,591
One more time. Push!

789
00:31:30,272 --> 00:31:31,272
Sheryll, you did it.

790
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:32,383
I did it?

791
00:31:32,407 --> 00:31:34,241
You did it, Sheryll. I...

792
00:31:44,469 --> 00:31:48,605
Hey, Lloyd. How's
everything at the NIH?

793
00:31:48,673 --> 00:31:52,175
<i>Uh, hello, Derek. I...
We, uh, still can't see you.</i>

794
00:31:52,244 --> 00:31:53,743
Yeah, we're working on that.

795
00:31:53,812 --> 00:31:55,879
Lloyd, I have
Dr. Callie Torres here.

796
00:31:55,947 --> 00:31:57,575
She and I developed
the sensors together.

797
00:31:57,599 --> 00:31:58,699
Hi, Lloyd.

798
00:31:58,767 --> 00:31:59,833
He can't see you.

799
00:31:59,902 --> 00:32:01,568
Oh.

800
00:32:01,653 --> 00:32:03,603
Look, Lloyd, I'm
afraid this whole

801
00:32:03,672 --> 00:32:05,338
proprietary thing
isn't going to work.

802
00:32:05,407 --> 00:32:08,141
Dr. Torres' and my work has
to continue with our sensors.

803
00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:10,443
<i>Derek, uh, before
we, uh, continue,</i>

804
00:32:10,512 --> 00:32:12,662
<i>I should tell you
that we are here</i>

805
00:32:12,731 --> 00:32:16,383
<i>with some folks from the
NIH and, uh, the White House.</i>

806
00:32:16,451 --> 00:32:17,751
<i>Here we are.</i>

807
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:20,903
<i>Gary Neal, Director of NIBS,</i>

808
00:32:20,973 --> 00:32:26,676
<i>and Sid Garret, our presidential
liaison for the Bioethics Committee,</i>

809
00:32:26,729 --> 00:32:30,664
<i>and this is Robin Marks of
the European Brain Initiative,</i>

810
00:32:30,733 --> 00:32:34,017
<i>and, uh, you know, of
course, Linda McCrary,</i>

811
00:32:34,085 --> 00:32:36,787
<i>and, uh, I'm sorry
I forgot your name.</i>

812
00:32:36,855 --> 00:32:37,999
Yeah, I'm glad you're all there.

813
00:32:38,023 --> 00:32:39,534
Actually, um, this
affects all of you.

814
00:32:39,558 --> 00:32:42,342
Lloyd, our work to map the
brain is like the brain itself.

815
00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:44,021
It's dependent upon connections,

816
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:46,663
our innovation and
inspiration of scientists

817
00:32:46,731 --> 00:32:48,631
like Dr. Torres and
millions of others.

818
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:51,234
If we have a policy
that thwarts innovation,

819
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:53,453
then we're stopping
before we even start.

820
00:32:53,522 --> 00:32:56,389
It's, uh, a fundamentally
wrong approach,

821
00:32:56,458 --> 00:32:57,840
and I can't support it.

822
00:32:57,909 --> 00:32:59,176
<i>Okay.</i>

823
00:32:59,244 --> 00:33:01,961
We are willing to share
our sensors with you,

824
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:04,264
but only if our work continues.

825
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:07,083
If everybody's
research continues.

826
00:33:07,152 --> 00:33:10,654
<i>Dr. Shepherd, your
contract is very clear.</i>

827
00:33:10,722 --> 00:33:14,373
<i>We have sole right to
your sensors, or you are out.</i>

828
00:33:14,443 --> 00:33:15,575
Then I am out.

829
00:33:16,427 --> 00:33:17,727
<i>The President himself...</i>

830
00:33:17,795 --> 00:33:19,295
You can tell that
to the President.

831
00:33:19,364 --> 00:33:21,765
Better yet, get him on the
phone. I will tell him myself.

832
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:24,467
Either the policy goes, or I go.

833
00:33:25,053 --> 00:33:26,653
<i>We will...</i>

834
00:33:27,823 --> 00:33:30,323
<i>have to figure out...</i>

835
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:33,676
<i>a way to share.</i>

836
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:38,981
<i>In the meantime, you can send
us the plans for your sensors,</i>

837
00:33:39,051 --> 00:33:42,852
<i>and, uh, Dr. Torres, of course,
uh, should continue her work.</i>

838
00:33:42,921 --> 00:33:47,391
Thank you, uh, Lloyd,
for your cooperation.

839
00:33:47,459 --> 00:33:48,791
I'll talk to you soon.

840
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,288
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

841
00:33:50,312 --> 00:33:51,428
Yes! Unh!

842
00:33:55,134 --> 00:33:56,900
Greg. Jodi.

843
00:33:56,968 --> 00:33:58,863
Okay, everything went very well.

844
00:33:58,887 --> 00:34:00,898
We're going... You promised me.

845
00:34:00,922 --> 00:34:02,622
Cough it up. Murphy.

846
00:34:07,596 --> 00:34:08,596
Thank you.

847
00:34:13,318 --> 00:34:15,535
Oh, my God! That's horrible!

848
00:34:15,603 --> 00:34:17,114
Thank you for
taking that out of me.

849
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:18,604
Take that away. Take that away.

850
00:34:18,674 --> 00:34:20,456
Thank you. Oh...

851
00:34:20,525 --> 00:34:21,925
Oh. Oh...

852
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:25,034
Oh. You stupid idiot.

853
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,832
You want me to take
that back to Path?

854
00:34:29,902 --> 00:34:31,812
Oh, are you kidding me?
This is my birthday present.

855
00:34:31,836 --> 00:34:33,336
Oh...

856
00:34:33,405 --> 00:34:37,707
Uh, speaking of which, I'll see
you, what, in about, uh, half an hour?

857
00:34:37,776 --> 00:34:39,342
Sir?

858
00:34:39,411 --> 00:34:41,277
Okay, now, you're
making me feel bad.

859
00:34:41,346 --> 00:34:44,063
What... If I'd have
known you wanted a party,

860
00:34:44,132 --> 00:34:45,498
I would have...

861
00:34:45,567 --> 00:34:47,317
Look, come to dinner
with me and Ben.

862
00:34:47,385 --> 00:34:49,152
Oh, oh, please.
Please, we'd love to...

863
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:50,764
We'd love to...
Bailey, stop. Bailey.

864
00:34:50,788 --> 00:34:53,072
I was just joking.

865
00:34:54,242 --> 00:34:55,875
Go and have fun.

866
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:02,348
Happy birthday.

867
00:35:04,419 --> 00:35:05,552
It's not blurry?

868
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:06,730
No, it's good.

869
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:09,767
Edwards. You had one job.

870
00:35:09,791 --> 00:35:11,090
Oh...

871
00:35:11,159 --> 00:35:13,976
Dr. Grey, we were just,
uh, looking at Eric's designs,

872
00:35:14,045 --> 00:35:15,272
which are actually
kind of amazing.

873
00:35:15,296 --> 00:35:16,563
I'm fired. I'm totally fired.

874
00:35:16,631 --> 00:35:18,293
Listen, Gary... Uh, Eric.

875
00:35:18,317 --> 00:35:20,695
What... Whatever. This
was my mother's project.

876
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:22,296
I took it over. It's my project.

877
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,815
So, it's sort of like
my family heirloom.

878
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:25,383
I totally get it. I
have this teacup...

879
00:35:25,407 --> 00:35:27,201
It's my baby, and I failed it.

880
00:35:27,225 --> 00:35:28,836
No, you didn't. Stop talking.

881
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,905
I failed it, and that's
not okay because

882
00:35:30,929 --> 00:35:32,873
other people's
babies are growing.

883
00:35:32,897 --> 00:35:34,776
They're thriving.
They're saving lives.

884
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,828
They're getting pats on
the backs from presidents.

885
00:35:36,852 --> 00:35:38,796
And mine is sitting
in a basement,

886
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:40,181
and we need to change that.

887
00:35:40,205 --> 00:35:41,882
She said "We."
Yeah, it's a good sign.

888
00:35:41,906 --> 00:35:43,540
Have a seat.

889
00:35:43,608 --> 00:35:46,254
Before you start printing, I want
to go over a few things with you.

890
00:35:46,278 --> 00:35:47,544
Well, I'm good right here.

891
00:35:47,612 --> 00:35:48,844
I said sit.

892
00:35:48,913 --> 00:35:50,824
So, the first time we printed,

893
00:35:50,848 --> 00:35:52,726
I think where I went wrong is...

894
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:55,110
<i>She's so beautiful.</i>

895
00:35:56,921 --> 00:36:00,081
You're telling me she's gonna
have to grow up without a mother?

896
00:36:00,124 --> 00:36:03,059
There are other options.

897
00:36:03,127 --> 00:36:04,994
You can get on
a transplant list,

898
00:36:05,063 --> 00:36:06,640
and maybe the next phase
of trials will be more inclusive.

899
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:08,180
But I want this one.

900
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:13,385
I am so, so sorry.

901
00:36:14,623 --> 00:36:16,589
You don't meet the criteria.

902
00:36:20,662 --> 00:36:22,262
Call your mom.

903
00:36:24,166 --> 00:36:26,966
I bet she's worried about you.

904
00:36:43,986 --> 00:36:46,919
Honestly, I'm really
proud of my boy.

905
00:36:46,989 --> 00:36:52,092
He had the stones to stand
up and ask for true love.

906
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,327
I... That's scary.

907
00:36:54,396 --> 00:36:56,636
Of course, I would
never tell him that.

908
00:36:56,764 --> 00:36:58,031
Mmm-hmm.

909
00:36:59,667 --> 00:37:01,412
What's the matter with you?

910
00:37:01,436 --> 00:37:03,796
You were quiet all the way here.

911
00:37:03,838 --> 00:37:06,317
Are you sad because no
one celebrated your birthday?

912
00:37:06,341 --> 00:37:08,258
Oh, come on. I'm not a child.

913
00:37:09,528 --> 00:37:11,227
Hunt's trying to push
me into retirement.

914
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:12,796
What?

915
00:37:12,864 --> 00:37:15,882
He started the day by handing
me directions to the pasture.

916
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:19,110
And you told him
where to stick it, right?

917
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:22,455
Oh, come on. Don't
slow down on me now.

918
00:37:22,523 --> 00:37:24,668
I'm ready to start the
next part of my life.

919
00:37:24,692 --> 00:37:26,871
And I thought I was
gonna do it with you.

920
00:37:26,895 --> 00:37:29,373
If you're not up for it,
you'd better step aside.

921
00:37:29,397 --> 00:37:31,717
And if you are, you... Mmm.

922
00:37:32,567 --> 00:37:33,567
Mmm.

923
00:37:38,874 --> 00:37:40,256
Let's go.

924
00:37:40,325 --> 00:37:41,908
All right.

925
00:37:41,993 --> 00:37:43,259
Now, smile.

926
00:37:44,563 --> 00:37:46,278
And act surprised.

927
00:37:46,348 --> 00:37:48,076
What? Mmm.

928
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,677
Surprise!

929
00:37:49,701 --> 00:37:51,751
Happy birthday, Dr. Webber!

930
00:37:56,491 --> 00:37:57,524
Surprise.

931
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:08,718
Happy birthday, sir.

932
00:38:08,787 --> 00:38:10,331
You looked right in my eyes,
and you lied to me, Bailey.

933
00:38:10,355 --> 00:38:12,672
Yeah, but it didn't count
because you were being stupid.

934
00:38:14,509 --> 00:38:16,642
Hey. Happy birthday.

935
00:38:16,712 --> 00:38:18,477
Well, thank you. Thank you.

936
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:21,241
Hey, Arizona told me that
Jackson put together a committee

937
00:38:21,265 --> 00:38:23,377
to look into this thing
for you and Callie.

938
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:26,463
My God. Whoops.
You can tell him to stop.

939
00:38:26,487 --> 00:38:27,732
You need a drink? Yeah.

940
00:38:27,756 --> 00:38:28,855
You can have a drink.

941
00:38:28,924 --> 00:38:30,473
Wait, well... Well,
what happened?

942
00:38:30,542 --> 00:38:32,837
We overthrew the
government today. We're thirsty.

943
00:38:32,861 --> 00:38:34,511
I don't... What?

944
00:38:36,965 --> 00:38:38,205
How are you doing?

945
00:38:38,249 --> 00:38:39,449
Okay.

946
00:38:39,518 --> 00:38:40,561
Here's your drink.

947
00:38:40,585 --> 00:38:41,985
I'll be better
once I've had this.

948
00:38:44,589 --> 00:38:45,705
Here you go.

949
00:38:47,108 --> 00:38:49,559
Women love you.

950
00:38:49,628 --> 00:38:53,062
You've had over 20 responses.
I narrowed it down to 10.

951
00:38:53,131 --> 00:38:55,431
You should look these over.
Pick three for coffee dates.

952
00:38:55,933 --> 00:38:56,933
Hmm.

953
00:38:58,603 --> 00:39:00,131
Hmm? Hmm. Hmm!

954
00:39:00,155 --> 00:39:03,722
Okay, I got to go talk to
Webber, and, after that,

955
00:39:03,792 --> 00:39:05,953
I think we should
get out of here.

956
00:39:05,977 --> 00:39:07,572
Owen. You could just wait here.

957
00:39:07,596 --> 00:39:10,613
Or we could meet
back at your place.

958
00:39:11,983 --> 00:39:13,863
Owen. Mmm-hmm?

959
00:39:21,309 --> 00:39:22,542
See?

960
00:39:22,611 --> 00:39:25,445
I can get in trouble for
that, and I don't want to.

961
00:39:27,816 --> 00:39:29,426
This isn't a
promise of anything.

962
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:31,596
You want a promise?
I can promise you this.

963
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:34,298
You can't count on me,
'cause stuff happens, you know?

964
00:39:34,322 --> 00:39:37,073
Houses burn. Cars
crash. People get sick.

965
00:39:37,142 --> 00:39:39,020
One of us could die tomorrow.

966
00:39:39,044 --> 00:39:43,262
I promise you cannot count on
anything, but this makes it so...

967
00:39:43,331 --> 00:39:45,475
I can kiss you
whenever I want to.

968
00:39:45,499 --> 00:39:47,361
I don't want the stupid
running around and hiding.

969
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:49,065
I want to kiss you
when I want to kiss you.

970
00:39:50,905 --> 00:39:52,772
What can I get for you?

971
00:39:58,496 --> 00:40:00,463
Yes.

972
00:40:09,290 --> 00:40:10,690
I know.

973
00:40:10,759 --> 00:40:12,592
Know what?

974
00:40:12,661 --> 00:40:16,101
What religious tradition I
want to bring my kids up in.

975
00:40:16,147 --> 00:40:19,799
You said you
don't know, but I do.

976
00:40:19,868 --> 00:40:22,279
It's important to me
that they're Christian.

977
00:40:22,303 --> 00:40:23,714
I thought you knew that.

978
00:40:23,738 --> 00:40:25,988
That my kids would have
different beliefs than I do?

979
00:40:26,057 --> 00:40:29,024
That's a little weird, April.

980
00:40:29,094 --> 00:40:33,496
<i>Transition is movement from
one part of life to a whole new one.</i>

981
00:40:33,564 --> 00:40:37,399
And board meetings at 15?

982
00:40:37,468 --> 00:40:39,828
I kind of pictured
my kids in 4-H.

983
00:40:40,605 --> 00:40:42,188
Like raising pigs?

984
00:40:42,257 --> 00:40:44,323
Or cows.

985
00:40:44,392 --> 00:40:47,455
It's important that they're
comfortable around livestock.

986
00:40:47,479 --> 00:40:49,828
Is it? Jackson.

987
00:40:49,898 --> 00:40:51,931
They'll ride horses
at boarding school.

988
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,027
They're going to
boarding school?

989
00:40:54,051 --> 00:40:58,755
<i>And it can feel like one
long, scary, dark tunnel...</i>

990
00:41:00,592 --> 00:41:03,009
So, this morning, I mentioned

991
00:41:03,078 --> 00:41:05,138
pulling back on your
surgical schedule.

992
00:41:05,162 --> 00:41:08,598
You want to do this
now, on my birthday?

993
00:41:08,666 --> 00:41:10,183
I'm sorry, Hunt,
I'm not retiring.

994
00:41:10,251 --> 00:41:11,617
You can force me, but I'm not...

995
00:41:11,686 --> 00:41:14,665
I'd like to appoint you director
of the residency program.

996
00:41:14,689 --> 00:41:16,266
You'd be in charge
of all the decisions

997
00:41:16,290 --> 00:41:19,470
regarding the educational
arm of this hospital.

998
00:41:19,494 --> 00:41:21,827
<i>But you have to come
out the other side...</i>

999
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:23,507
I can teach. I'm good at it.

1000
00:41:23,531 --> 00:41:26,927
But you bring something
to it that I just can't.

1001
00:41:26,951 --> 00:41:28,000
Well, what's that?

1002
00:41:28,703 --> 00:41:30,236
You.

1003
00:41:30,305 --> 00:41:32,165
Take some time
to think about it.

1004
00:41:33,591 --> 00:41:35,475
I'd like to make a
toast to Dr. Webber.

1005
00:41:35,543 --> 00:41:37,076
Me, too. What?

1006
00:41:37,145 --> 00:41:38,862
Not before I finish mine.

1007
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:41,926
While you guys fight
it out, I just want to say

1008
00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:44,662
I wouldn't be here if it
weren't for Dr. Webber.

1009
00:41:44,686 --> 00:41:47,219
Thank you, sir. Happy birthday.

1010
00:41:47,288 --> 00:41:49,221
Happy birthday.

1011
00:41:49,291 --> 00:41:50,556
Thank you.

1012
00:41:50,625 --> 00:41:51,802
<i>Because what's
been waiting there...</i>

1013
00:41:51,826 --> 00:41:52,826
Cheers.

1014
00:41:52,894 --> 00:41:54,260
Cheers.

1015
00:41:54,328 --> 00:41:55,561
Cheers.

1016
00:41:58,583 --> 00:42:00,466
<i>Might be glorious.</i>

1017
00:42:07,708 --> 00:42:09,748
Residency director,
hmm? Mmm-hmm.

1018
00:42:09,811 --> 00:42:13,612
Yeah. I'll think about it.
