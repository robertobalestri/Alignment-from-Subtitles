1
00:00:04,505 --> 00:00:07,139
<i>Cancer is a biological bully,</i>

2
00:00:07,207 --> 00:00:09,208
<i>always picking a fight,</i>

3
00:00:09,276 --> 00:00:11,109
<i>and it'll sneak up on you.</i>

4
00:00:11,178 --> 00:00:13,545
Can we just stay in bed all day?

5
00:00:13,613 --> 00:00:14,930
I could be into that.

6
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,651
You are not making
this any easier.

7
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:21,353
Okay, okay, 15 minutes.

8
00:00:21,422 --> 00:00:24,856
I have 15 minutes until I absolutely
have to get up and get going.

9
00:00:24,925 --> 00:00:27,837
All right, well, then let's make
the most of the next 15 minutes!

10
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:29,756
<i>It'll wait until the
body feels safe,</i>

11
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:32,147
<i>until it feels
healthy and strong...</i>

12
00:00:32,215 --> 00:00:34,750
I can't believe I'm dating a
man who lives in a tin can.

13
00:00:34,818 --> 00:00:37,319
A tin can on wheels.

14
00:00:37,388 --> 00:00:39,053
You ever think of moving

15
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:40,656
to a place that can't roll away?

16
00:00:40,724 --> 00:00:43,164
I haven't given it much thought.

17
00:00:43,226 --> 00:00:45,977
Mmm. Not that I
don't love the trailer

18
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:47,696
and the roughing it in nature.

19
00:00:48,832 --> 00:00:49,832
It's like camping.

20
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:52,801
Wait. Wait. You hate camping.

21
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:54,448
I hate camping. I do. Yeah.

22
00:00:54,472 --> 00:00:56,472
Yeah.

23
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:01,944
Well, maybe we
should look at getting

24
00:01:02,012 --> 00:01:04,213
a bigger place... Together.

25
00:01:04,298 --> 00:01:07,832
I thought you hadn't
given it much thought.

26
00:01:07,902 --> 00:01:10,435
I just did. I'm a fast thinker.

27
00:01:10,504 --> 00:01:11,744
What do you think?

28
00:01:11,789 --> 00:01:14,723
I think that's a good idea.

29
00:01:14,792 --> 00:01:15,924
I'm a fast thinker, too.

30
00:01:18,194 --> 00:01:21,129
<i>That's when cancer
will move on in</i>

31
00:01:21,198 --> 00:01:22,798
<i>and get bigger and bigger.</i>

32
00:01:22,866 --> 00:01:25,901
What do you think, the
blue or the, uh, burgundy?

33
00:01:25,969 --> 00:01:27,502
The blue makes you
look too handsome.

34
00:01:27,571 --> 00:01:28,704
Oh.

35
00:01:28,772 --> 00:01:29,705
You don't want the
president to be distracted

36
00:01:29,773 --> 00:01:31,239
by those piercing blue eyes.

37
00:01:31,307 --> 00:01:32,568
Oh, you want me to get the job.

38
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:34,877
I want neurosurgeon
Dr. Shepherd to get the job.

39
00:01:34,945 --> 00:01:37,262
I don't want my husband
Dr. Shepherd to get the job.

40
00:01:37,331 --> 00:01:38,713
That's complicated.

41
00:01:38,782 --> 00:01:41,132
Yes, well, I'm complicated.

42
00:01:41,185 --> 00:01:42,484
I'm gonna take a shower now.

43
00:01:42,553 --> 00:01:43,769
So am I.

44
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:45,557
No. It's been three weeks.

45
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:47,172
You went back on your promise.

46
00:01:47,241 --> 00:01:49,674
I can't sleep with a
man who's a lying liar.

47
00:01:49,727 --> 00:01:51,477
What if I put on the blue tie?

48
00:01:51,529 --> 00:01:53,512
Nope.

49
00:01:53,564 --> 00:01:56,297
You're having fun.
You delight in my pain.

50
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:58,332
I just took off my robe.

51
00:01:58,401 --> 00:02:01,002
Now I'm soaping myself up.

52
00:02:01,071 --> 00:02:02,821
Oh, my goodness.

53
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:04,884
<i>The body never
even sees it coming...</i>

54
00:02:04,908 --> 00:02:06,136
Callie, come on. We got to go.

55
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,627
Well, we said we'd
each do a box a day.

56
00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:09,923
I'm doing mine,
so come do yours.

57
00:02:09,947 --> 00:02:11,040
No, no, no. Sofia's ready to go.

58
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:12,375
Come on, it'll
just take a minute.

59
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:14,144
Callie... Unpack this box!

60
00:02:16,504 --> 00:02:19,638
You know, the whole
world is not going to end

61
00:02:19,706 --> 00:02:21,456
if I don't open this box...

62
00:02:22,876 --> 00:02:24,275
Open it.

63
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:30,616
<i>Because cancer is
the master of surprises.</i>

64
00:02:30,684 --> 00:02:31,744
I inscribed the band

65
00:02:31,768 --> 00:02:34,268
with the date we
moved into this house.

66
00:02:34,337 --> 00:02:36,437
Our new start.

67
00:02:42,613 --> 00:02:45,313
Calliope Iphegenia Torres...

68
00:02:45,382 --> 00:02:46,965
Put it on!

69
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:49,401
<i>Take it off!</i>

70
00:02:49,453 --> 00:02:50,964
Take it off! Your ring. - Oh.

71
00:02:50,988 --> 00:02:52,020
Take off your ring.

72
00:02:54,725 --> 00:02:55,769
Thank you, Dr. Avery.

73
00:02:55,793 --> 00:02:57,425
I am, um... I'm glad you agree

74
00:02:57,494 --> 00:02:59,861
that a microvascular free
flap is called for in this...

75
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:00,930
Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

76
00:03:00,998 --> 00:03:02,238
Particular scenario.

77
00:03:03,817 --> 00:03:06,029
Well, you are not getting
your security deposit back.

78
00:03:06,053 --> 00:03:07,218
Glad I never gave you one.

79
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:08,598
You guys are really serious.

80
00:03:08,622 --> 00:03:09,622
Yes, we are.

81
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:12,223
What did I miss?

82
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:14,593
Owen and Emma
are moving in together.

83
00:03:14,662 --> 00:03:15,861
He holds a meeting for that?

84
00:03:17,264 --> 00:03:18,864
Thank you all for coming.

85
00:03:18,933 --> 00:03:20,977
I know you're all busy,
so this won't take long.

86
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:25,386
The board has just approved
a new non-fraternization policy.

87
00:03:25,456 --> 00:03:28,122
This hospital has to be
a safe work environment

88
00:03:28,191 --> 00:03:30,503
where our focus remains
clearly on providing

89
00:03:30,527 --> 00:03:32,544
the best patient care possible.

90
00:03:32,613 --> 00:03:33,711
Moving forward,

91
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,497
all relationships
with co-workers

92
00:03:35,565 --> 00:03:36,914
will be discouraged.

93
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:39,968
And all relationships between
superiors and subordinates

94
00:03:40,054 --> 00:03:41,619
is strictly prohibited.

95
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:44,239
You will all receive a
copy of the new rules.

96
00:03:44,308 --> 00:03:47,103
Your supervisors will arrange
meetings to go over the details.

97
00:03:47,127 --> 00:03:49,093
And that's it. Let's
get back to work.

98
00:03:52,233 --> 00:03:55,767
So you're the panty police now?

99
00:03:57,037 --> 00:03:59,132
I know there will
be some feelings,

100
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:00,299
and I know you've established

101
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:01,768
good relationships
with the residents,

102
00:04:01,792 --> 00:04:03,102
so I'd like you to
take them today

103
00:04:03,126 --> 00:04:05,243
and make sure that they
understand the policy.

104
00:04:05,312 --> 00:04:07,111
So you want me to
be the panty police.

105
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,414
All due respect, nuts to that.

106
00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:12,217
Dr. Hunt, we have some
questions about the policy.

107
00:04:12,286 --> 00:04:16,020
Dr. Webber can answer
all of your questions.

108
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:23,078
<i>Radiology.</i>

109
00:04:23,146 --> 00:04:25,480
<i>Radiology.</i>

110
00:04:25,548 --> 00:04:27,132
Hey, Rory. How you doing?

111
00:04:27,201 --> 00:04:29,517
Besides the fact that I
have bone cancer, I'm great.

112
00:04:29,586 --> 00:04:31,920
Seriously. Look at this polish.

113
00:04:31,989 --> 00:04:33,229
It's called "bad to the bone."

114
00:04:33,274 --> 00:04:35,218
Mm! We saw it at the drugstore,

115
00:04:35,242 --> 00:04:36,886
and it was like God
ordered us to buy it.

116
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:39,039
Hey, I don't take any
orders from any god

117
00:04:39,063 --> 00:04:40,311
who gives me cancer twice.

118
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,430
Dude, your stupid brain
cancer got us a puppy,

119
00:04:42,499 --> 00:04:43,631
and your stupid bone cancer

120
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,233
is getting us
both out of finals.

121
00:04:45,301 --> 00:04:46,346
You're right.

122
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:48,135
Yay, God.

123
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:49,444
Take a deep breath.

124
00:04:49,505 --> 00:04:51,067
All right, so today's
gonna be a piece of cake.

125
00:04:51,091 --> 00:04:52,701
We're gonna stage
the tumor, do a biopsy,

126
00:04:52,725 --> 00:04:54,471
and then we'll come
up with a treatment plan.

127
00:04:54,495 --> 00:04:55,805
This isn't a brain
tumor coming back?

128
00:04:55,829 --> 00:04:57,562
I mean, it was six
years ago, but...

129
00:04:57,631 --> 00:04:59,475
No, I looked at Dr. Shepherd's
notes and his follow-up scans,

130
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:00,876
and I really think
that you beat that.

131
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,462
I think this is a totally
separate cancer.

132
00:05:02,486 --> 00:05:03,546
Are you having any
trouble breathing?

133
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:05,052
No.

134
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:07,622
She has decreased breath sounds.

135
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:09,991
Let's add a contrast
study to that staging CT.

136
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,376
Why? What do you think it is?

137
00:05:11,428 --> 00:05:13,962
Uh, the contrast just gives
us more of a detailed look.

138
00:05:15,683 --> 00:05:18,383
Um, yeah, you know,
and it'll give your toes

139
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:20,229
a chance to dry
before the biopsy.

140
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:22,133
Perfect. CALLIE: Yeah.

141
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:28,534
Coming through!

142
00:05:28,562 --> 00:05:30,261
What do we got?

143
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,275
Lisa Campbell, 32, found
in apartment trash chute.

144
00:05:33,299 --> 00:05:35,611
Compactor tore her leg up
pretty good before it jammed.

145
00:05:35,635 --> 00:05:37,235
Lost a lot of
blood in the field,

146
00:05:37,303 --> 00:05:38,770
but vitals are stable.

147
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:40,605
Why was she in a trash...

148
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:41,990
Foraging for food, probably.

149
00:05:42,059 --> 00:05:43,770
How many times
do I have to tell you?

150
00:05:43,794 --> 00:05:45,438
I'm not homeless.
I don't forage.

151
00:05:45,462 --> 00:05:46,611
I have a PhD.

152
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,047
On my count. One, two, three.

153
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:52,784
Okay, start her on
one gram of Cefazolin.

154
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:55,152
We need to clean
this out. Page plastics.

155
00:05:55,221 --> 00:05:57,154
I'll do it. All right, Lisa,

156
00:05:57,223 --> 00:05:58,535
is there anyone you'd
like for us to call?

157
00:05:58,559 --> 00:05:59,874
My boyfriend.

158
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:01,321
I was in that trash
chute for two days.

159
00:06:01,345 --> 00:06:02,539
He's probably worried sick.

160
00:06:02,563 --> 00:06:05,279
His name is Ted.
If his wife answers,

161
00:06:05,366 --> 00:06:07,632
hang up and try
again in an hour.

162
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:13,399
- This can't be legal.
- It is.

163
00:06:13,423 --> 00:06:15,857
The hospital is allowed
to create any policy

164
00:06:15,926 --> 00:06:18,037
regarding co-workers
dating that they see fit.

165
00:06:18,061 --> 00:06:20,695
Shepherd met Grey
while she was an intern.

166
00:06:20,763 --> 00:06:22,141
And what about
Warren and Bailey?

167
00:06:22,165 --> 00:06:23,231
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

168
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,599
We're married, so just...

169
00:06:24,668 --> 00:06:26,801
If dating co-workers
is frowned upon,

170
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:28,503
how are they supposed
to meet anyone?

171
00:06:28,571 --> 00:06:29,682
I'm good. You don't
have to worry about me.

172
00:06:29,706 --> 00:06:30,900
You spend half
your life here, Shane.

173
00:06:30,924 --> 00:06:32,640
This is your dating pool.

174
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:35,860
Why am I the only one
who thinks this is ridiculous?

175
00:06:35,929 --> 00:06:37,339
They shouldn't be
able to do this to us.

176
00:06:37,363 --> 00:06:39,358
Nobody's doing anything to you.

177
00:06:39,382 --> 00:06:41,549
This is being done for you.

178
00:06:41,617 --> 00:06:44,352
One of your own
didn't feel safe at work

179
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,582
and lodged an
anonymous complaint.

180
00:06:45,606 --> 00:06:46,606
One of our own?

181
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:50,765
You realize you just made
my relationship illegal.

182
00:06:51,961 --> 00:06:53,681
Pretty sure he just
said it was anonymous.

183
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:54,879
Yeah, right.

184
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,044
That's a giant mass.

185
00:07:15,068 --> 00:07:16,234
Could be a met.

186
00:07:16,303 --> 00:07:18,047
She had brain
cancer six years ago,

187
00:07:18,071 --> 00:07:20,972
and Torres is doing a biopsy
on a possible osteosarcoma.

188
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:22,961
Three cancers by
the ripe, old age of 16.

189
00:07:24,061 --> 00:07:25,788
That's bad luck or
something genetic.

190
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:27,262
Bailey's gonna test for a link.

191
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:29,064
What do you think?

192
00:07:29,132 --> 00:07:30,515
Highly invasive.

193
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:31,627
I don't think you can remove it

194
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:32,728
without shrinking it first.

195
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:34,263
What if she doesn't
respond to chemo?

196
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:35,607
Then we still need to figure out

197
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:37,416
a surgical approach
that won't just kill her.

198
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,241
We need to be as
aggressive as this cancer.

199
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:41,642
Mm. Okay.

200
00:07:41,712 --> 00:07:43,355
All right, folks.
You're gonna study

201
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:44,991
her case files,
look at the scans.

202
00:07:45,015 --> 00:07:47,276
I want you to come up with
a surgical treatment plan.

203
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,801
The board did you a
favor with this new rule.

204
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:52,148
You're gonna take all that
brain power you used to

205
00:07:52,172 --> 00:07:54,872
devote to penises and vaginas
and put it to some good use.

206
00:07:56,176 --> 00:07:58,321
Um, can we, uh, use
other doctors as resources?

207
00:07:58,345 --> 00:07:59,544
What, like your wife?

208
00:07:59,613 --> 00:08:01,328
Yes, you should, and you can.

209
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:02,597
Work as a team.

210
00:08:02,665 --> 00:08:04,310
Bounce ideas off of one another.

211
00:08:04,334 --> 00:08:06,551
You come up with
something, I'm all ears.

212
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:10,622
So, uh, you guys want to start
throwing some ideas around or...

213
00:08:10,691 --> 00:08:12,491
I'm good on my own.

214
00:08:21,935 --> 00:08:23,512
My flight leaves
at 9:00 tonight.

215
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:24,881
The cab's gonna pick me up here.

216
00:08:24,905 --> 00:08:26,015
The kids are in daycare.

217
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:27,500
The laundry is clean and folded,

218
00:08:27,524 --> 00:08:29,168
and the kitchen
is fully stocked.

219
00:08:29,192 --> 00:08:30,725
It's one last interview.

220
00:08:30,794 --> 00:08:32,255
You've said that before
the last two interviews.

221
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:34,190
I know. I will see
you before I leave.

222
00:08:34,214 --> 00:08:36,147
Where you going?

223
00:08:36,216 --> 00:08:37,493
Uh, actually, I have another
interview with the White House.

224
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,250
Oh, show-off.

225
00:08:39,319 --> 00:08:40,396
Hey, do you want to sleep over?

226
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:41,564
You can help me
try and figure out

227
00:08:41,588 --> 00:08:42,998
why my research
isn't working. Aw.

228
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,133
And you can help
me with the kids.

229
00:08:44,157 --> 00:08:45,568
Mnh-mnh. Sounds
like fraternization.

230
00:08:45,592 --> 00:08:47,170
We could talk about
Owen and Emma.

231
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:49,677
Oh, what's there to talk about?
They're moving in. Whatever.

232
00:08:49,746 --> 00:08:51,446
I have wine.

233
00:08:51,515 --> 00:08:52,614
I'll be there.

234
00:08:52,682 --> 00:08:54,432
Yeah. Figured.

235
00:08:54,501 --> 00:08:55,834
For you.

236
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:58,319
So, we're supposed to fill
this whole thing up with spit?

237
00:08:58,388 --> 00:08:59,854
No. To the line.

238
00:08:59,923 --> 00:09:01,555
How?

239
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:04,893
Think about dill pickles.

240
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:06,327
Oh, my God. It works.

241
00:09:06,396 --> 00:09:08,374
Every time.

242
00:09:08,398 --> 00:09:10,518
And this is going to tell you...

243
00:09:10,566 --> 00:09:12,700
If there's a genetic reason

244
00:09:12,769 --> 00:09:14,664
why you all keep getting cancer.

245
00:09:14,688 --> 00:09:16,232
Well, it's got to be
in my wife's side.

246
00:09:16,256 --> 00:09:17,839
There's been a couple of breast,

247
00:09:17,908 --> 00:09:20,175
a pancreas, a lung, and a butt.

248
00:09:20,243 --> 00:09:22,344
Oh, and Billy's balls.

249
00:09:22,412 --> 00:09:24,245
But we keep surviving.

250
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:25,647
We beat cancer.

251
00:09:25,716 --> 00:09:26,748
Yep.

252
00:09:26,817 --> 00:09:28,349
That's what we do.

253
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:34,850
Go ahead and alert the OR.
I have a debride leg repair.

254
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:35,952
Right away, Doctor.

255
00:09:35,976 --> 00:09:37,186
God, Lisa.

256
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:38,387
I told you not to
come to the party.

257
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,406
I also told you not
to have a secret affair

258
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:41,941
with the head of the sociology
department, by the way.

259
00:09:41,965 --> 00:09:43,865
I know. I know. You're right.

260
00:09:43,934 --> 00:09:45,499
But, you know, I
wasn't going to go,

261
00:09:45,568 --> 00:09:47,246
but then everyone from
the department was going.

262
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:48,580
It would have looked
strange if I wasn't there.

263
00:09:48,604 --> 00:09:50,816
Really? You don't think
getting stuck in his trash chute

264
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,685
with a piece of
fish in your hair

265
00:09:52,709 --> 00:09:54,925
looks more strange
than not going to a party?

266
00:09:54,994 --> 00:09:56,060
Mnh-mnh.

267
00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:57,662
How did this happen?

268
00:09:57,731 --> 00:09:59,830
Well, you know, he
ignored me all night,

269
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:01,666
which maybe I'm used to

270
00:10:01,735 --> 00:10:03,215
because that's
how we are in public.

271
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,053
But after a while, I just...

272
00:10:05,122 --> 00:10:06,562
I couldn't take it anymore.

273
00:10:06,589 --> 00:10:09,324
So, I grabbed my coat and
made a break for the door,

274
00:10:09,393 --> 00:10:11,526
but just as I was
about to leave,

275
00:10:11,594 --> 00:10:15,463
he called my name,
and I stopped because...

276
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:17,115
finally.

277
00:10:17,184 --> 00:10:19,901
But all he did
was ask if I'd mind

278
00:10:19,969 --> 00:10:21,519
throwing out the
trash on my way out.

279
00:10:21,588 --> 00:10:23,688
And I didn't know what to say,

280
00:10:23,757 --> 00:10:28,276
so I took the bag, the
big, smelly trash bag,

281
00:10:28,345 --> 00:10:30,311
and I tossed it in the chute.

282
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,747
But I was so mortified
because I didn't realize

283
00:10:32,816 --> 00:10:35,216
I had thrown my
purse along with it.

284
00:10:35,284 --> 00:10:36,617
So, you jumped in after it?

285
00:10:36,686 --> 00:10:38,736
Oh, I clearly make
excellent choices.

286
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:41,405
Does Ted know what happened?

287
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,091
No. I didn't tell him.

288
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,203
I was trying to
preserve your dignity.

289
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:45,509
Thank you.

290
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:47,423
I didn't realize there was
nothing left to preserve.

291
00:10:47,447 --> 00:10:50,281
Um, well, I certainly can't do
anything about your dignity,

292
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:51,694
but if we're gonna
preserve this leg,

293
00:10:51,718 --> 00:10:53,529
we need to get you
right up to the OR.

294
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:56,137
Is that a shrimp tail?

295
00:10:56,206 --> 00:10:57,922
Oh, no, that's a prawn.

296
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:00,791
Ted's wife prepared them.

297
00:11:00,861 --> 00:11:02,605
They were actually really good.

298
00:11:02,629 --> 00:11:04,345
Oh, my God.

299
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:10,535
Well, the prelim path report

300
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:12,047
looks like high-grade
osteosarcoma.

301
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:14,016
But we'll need another
day to get the final report.

302
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,185
We still need to figure out
what's going on in her chest.

303
00:11:16,209 --> 00:11:17,241
Yeah.

304
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:18,521
Hey! Did you show Kepner?

305
00:11:18,545 --> 00:11:20,022
No, no, no, she's
working with Avery all day,

306
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:21,086
so I didn't want to brag.

307
00:11:21,113 --> 00:11:22,224
Ah, good call. Yeah.

308
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:23,559
But then we had
coffee, and it sparkled,

309
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:25,060
so I ended up, you know,
showing it off, anyway.

310
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:26,550
There were squeals.

311
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:28,114
Hey, Karev, do you notice
anything different about me?

312
00:11:28,138 --> 00:11:29,170
No.

313
00:11:29,239 --> 00:11:30,239
Callie gave it to me.

314
00:11:30,306 --> 00:11:31,805
We're trying to
unpack a box a day.

315
00:11:31,874 --> 00:11:33,441
So, this morning, Callie was...

316
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:35,776
Hey, you know, most
people at least pretend

317
00:11:35,845 --> 00:11:37,478
to like this story, so...

318
00:11:37,547 --> 00:11:39,458
Alex, you can't keep
ignoring my pages.

319
00:11:39,482 --> 00:11:40,722
We really need to talk.

320
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:42,144
Not now. If not now, when?

321
00:11:42,168 --> 00:11:43,729
We can't sneak off to
have a private conversation.

322
00:11:43,753 --> 00:11:44,914
It's forbidden!

323
00:11:44,938 --> 00:11:47,205
Oh, will you stop?
It's just a stupid rule.

324
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:48,473
Nobody's taking it seriously.

325
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:50,057
I'm taking it seriously.

326
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:51,954
You don't have to worry about
it because you have seniority,

327
00:11:51,978 --> 00:11:53,578
but I'm a resident.

328
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:55,524
This is my reputation we're
talking about, my career.

329
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,226
I know that you
think the rule is crap,

330
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,744
but we can't just
ignore it at my expense.

331
00:11:58,768 --> 00:12:00,608
You're overreacting!
No, I'm not!

332
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:02,064
Oh, so, what, you're
just gonna roll over

333
00:12:02,088 --> 00:12:03,966
and let the hospital tell
you who you can be with?

334
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:05,033
There isn't a choice.

335
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:06,474
There's always a choice!

336
00:12:06,543 --> 00:12:09,310
You can choose to make
the best out of a bad situation.

337
00:12:09,379 --> 00:12:10,756
You can choose
to act like an adult.

338
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:12,424
You can choose
not to pick a fight

339
00:12:12,448 --> 00:12:14,009
in front of the entire hospital.

340
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:15,332
You want to walk around here

341
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:17,346
and pretend like we don't
mean anything to each other?

342
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:18,803
Fine. I'll make it easy for you.

343
00:12:18,872 --> 00:12:20,404
We don't mean
anything to each other,

344
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:21,753
not anymore, 'cause we're done!

345
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:24,892
That is not what I want. Alex!

346
00:12:29,716 --> 00:12:31,199
Are you okay?

347
00:12:34,955 --> 00:12:36,354
Hmm.

348
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:39,952
Hey. How was that?

349
00:12:39,976 --> 00:12:41,525
Alarmingly convincing.

350
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,828
Just stop freaking out, okay?

351
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:44,912
Now I will.

352
00:12:44,981 --> 00:12:46,213
Thanks for doing that for me.

353
00:12:46,282 --> 00:12:47,966
I'll see you tonight.

354
00:12:58,878 --> 00:13:00,978
You know, I appreciate
the dinner date,

355
00:13:01,047 --> 00:13:04,399
but I thought Webber told
you people to work together.

356
00:13:04,467 --> 00:13:06,328
We're not gonna get
anywhere that way.

357
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:09,637
I know this
non-fraternization policy

358
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:11,116
is gonna be beneficial
in the long run,

359
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:13,307
but for now, it just
gives those kids

360
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:16,143
one more reason to shut me out.

361
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:19,914
Um, just who are you
trying to fraternize with?

362
00:13:19,982 --> 00:13:22,533
Um, my wife.

363
00:13:22,602 --> 00:13:26,270
They're mad at me
because I get to be happy.

364
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:27,339
Mm.

365
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,008
Seems hardly fair.

366
00:13:30,076 --> 00:13:32,276
I agree.

367
00:13:32,345 --> 00:13:37,298
But, uh, you know, they're
gonna hate me anyway.

368
00:13:37,366 --> 00:13:39,745
So might as well get
something out of it, right?

369
00:13:39,769 --> 00:13:42,002
Ben Warren, we are at work.

370
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:44,171
Mmm-hmm.

371
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,573
But you can lock that door.

372
00:13:51,013 --> 00:13:53,581
Oh, my God.

373
00:13:54,283 --> 00:13:55,516
Already?

374
00:13:55,585 --> 00:13:56,796
I haven't even
gotten started yet.

375
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:00,555
No, uh, there's a
mutation in the P53 gene.

376
00:14:00,623 --> 00:14:02,222
What does that mean?

377
00:14:04,294 --> 00:14:06,711
Emma probably keeps a nice home,

378
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:10,398
has window treatments,
uses place mats.

379
00:14:10,467 --> 00:14:12,467
Oh, place mats are overrated.

380
00:14:12,535 --> 00:14:14,535
I want him to be happy.

381
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:16,287
I'm enjoying torturing Derek.

382
00:14:16,339 --> 00:14:19,190
Does that make
me a terrible person?

383
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:21,159
Mnh-mnh. Mnh-mnh.

384
00:14:21,227 --> 00:14:24,144
Mm. It's weird, though.

385
00:14:24,213 --> 00:14:25,730
It's really over.

386
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:29,535
I'm empty.

387
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:30,868
Yep.

388
00:14:30,937 --> 00:14:33,288
That window is closing.

389
00:14:33,356 --> 00:14:36,874
She is gonna give him babies,

390
00:14:36,943 --> 00:14:39,610
and then he's gonna
be somebody's daddy.

391
00:14:39,678 --> 00:14:42,346
And then it's really over.

392
00:14:42,415 --> 00:14:44,916
But you guys are divorced
and seeing other people.

393
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:47,935
Doesn't that mean it's
really over, anyway?

394
00:14:48,004 --> 00:14:50,449
Oh, come on. You should
know better than anyone

395
00:14:50,473 --> 00:14:52,557
that that is not true.

396
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:54,491
But somebody's daddy?

397
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:57,061
You kind of can't
get between that.

398
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:02,633
You're supposed
to be on a plane.

399
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:05,064
They called me before I
even left to go to the airport

400
00:15:05,088 --> 00:15:08,189
and canceled the interview.

401
00:15:08,258 --> 00:15:09,823
Well, what does that mean?

402
00:15:09,892 --> 00:15:11,392
The president dumped him.

403
00:15:11,461 --> 00:15:12,504
Shh! Oh.

404
00:15:12,528 --> 00:15:14,328
You know, I'm out. I'm out.

405
00:15:14,397 --> 00:15:17,131
You guys, uh, have,
uh, a good night.

406
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,999
I'm catching a cab.

407
00:15:19,068 --> 00:15:21,802
Bye, bye, bye.
Kiss to the girls.

408
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,217
I think I'm gonna turn in.

409
00:15:25,241 --> 00:15:27,642
You don't know that it's over.

410
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:29,710
What did they say?

411
00:15:29,779 --> 00:15:32,430
I better turn in.

412
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:39,837
Congratulations!

413
00:15:41,308 --> 00:15:43,241
I heard you're moving...

414
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:44,726
In with Emma!

415
00:15:44,794 --> 00:15:47,128
Um, yeah.

416
00:15:47,197 --> 00:15:48,237
We might, yeah.

417
00:15:48,297 --> 00:15:49,931
Yeah, so I brought
you some wine!

418
00:15:49,999 --> 00:15:51,331
Whoa, what...

419
00:15:51,401 --> 00:15:53,679
Wait. This is a very
nice bottle of wine.

420
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:54,835
Yeah, I know.

421
00:15:54,904 --> 00:15:56,214
Uh, uh, I swiped it
from Derek's collection.

422
00:15:56,238 --> 00:15:57,358
It looked really expensive.

423
00:15:58,508 --> 00:16:00,007
So, enjoy!

424
00:16:00,075 --> 00:16:01,409
The both of you.

425
00:16:01,477 --> 00:16:03,538
Oh, no, Emma's...
She's not here.

426
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:04,562
Oh.

427
00:16:06,232 --> 00:16:07,498
<i>So, what's the plan now?</i>

428
00:16:07,566 --> 00:16:10,335
Should I start sneaking
in your bedroom window?

429
00:16:10,403 --> 00:16:12,114
You do live with one
of the board members.

430
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:13,504
I told you, she's at Mer's.

431
00:16:13,573 --> 00:16:15,373
Yeah, I'm not just
talking about tonight.

432
00:16:15,442 --> 00:16:17,274
Look. Things will blow over.

433
00:16:17,344 --> 00:16:20,211
I'll work on Mer and
Cristina. This will all go away.

434
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:21,424
Until then, yeah,

435
00:16:21,448 --> 00:16:23,892
maybe you sneak in
my bedroom window.

436
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:29,320
But Yang's supposed
to be out all night tonight.

437
00:16:29,389 --> 00:16:31,288
Yeah. You want to go upstairs?

438
00:16:31,358 --> 00:16:34,492
I would, but upstairs
is just so far away.

439
00:16:41,684 --> 00:16:42,950
Hi.

440
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:44,930
I got so many compliments
on my ring today.

441
00:16:44,954 --> 00:16:45,954
Ooh.

442
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:51,475
It's so sad, though,
about Alex and Wilson.

443
00:16:51,544 --> 00:16:53,171
Oh, yeah. Mmm.

444
00:16:53,195 --> 00:16:57,114
It's not fair, right, that
we get to be so happy

445
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:59,199
and other people have
to be so miserable?

446
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:01,668
Yeah, like April...
Just out in the cold.

447
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:04,271
I feel terrible.

448
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:05,356
Awful.

449
00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:07,144
Mmm.

450
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:08,692
Who am I gonna sleep with?

451
00:17:09,895 --> 00:17:11,073
The hospital is my dating pool.

452
00:17:11,097 --> 00:17:12,196
Mm-hmm.

453
00:17:12,265 --> 00:17:15,933
You... You are
making it impossible

454
00:17:16,001 --> 00:17:17,701
for me to get laid.

455
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:19,848
Well, I don't think that
has ever been a problem.

456
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,974
Yeah, well...

457
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:25,709
Mmm.

458
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:27,044
Were you sad

459
00:17:27,113 --> 00:17:29,280
there weren't any window
treatments at the firehouse?

460
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:30,381
What?

461
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:33,284
You know, drapes and, uh,

462
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:35,219
the thing that
goes on top of it.

463
00:17:35,288 --> 00:17:36,731
Uh... What are they called?

464
00:17:36,755 --> 00:17:38,155
It's a curtain rod?

465
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:39,890
Mnh-mnh. No.

466
00:17:39,959 --> 00:17:41,525
I mean, yes, obviously
you need that,

467
00:17:41,594 --> 00:17:43,561
but there's that other thing.

468
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:45,329
I should know this.

469
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:47,398
My mother is an
interior decorator.

470
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:48,665
I spent my childhood

471
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,902
listening to her talk
about these things.

472
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:52,303
Who are you... Are you...

473
00:17:52,372 --> 00:17:53,737
Mom? Hey, it's me.

474
00:17:53,806 --> 00:17:55,706
Yes. Yeah, I know it's late.

475
00:17:55,775 --> 00:17:57,141
No, I'm fine.

476
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:59,043
Listen, uh, what do you call,

477
00:17:59,112 --> 00:18:02,280
uh, those things that are
on top of your windows?

478
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:04,916
No, the other thing.

479
00:18:04,984 --> 00:18:07,451
Valance! Yes!

480
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,253
Thank you. Okay, good night.

481
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:11,956
Valance.

482
00:18:12,025 --> 00:18:13,791
Were you... Were you sad

483
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:15,492
we never had valances?

484
00:18:15,561 --> 00:18:16,605
No.

485
00:18:16,629 --> 00:18:17,706
No. A little bit?

486
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:19,830
No. No.

487
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:23,434
I'm not sad...

488
00:18:23,503 --> 00:18:24,801
That we didn't have valances.

489
00:18:43,439 --> 00:18:46,974
It never occurred
to me, you know,

490
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:48,409
to get window treatments.

491
00:18:52,081 --> 00:18:53,121
I know.

492
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:19,156
I'll input them for you.

493
00:19:19,225 --> 00:19:20,558
Great. Thank you.

494
00:19:20,626 --> 00:19:22,270
Hey, sorry I couldn't
come by last night.

495
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:24,328
Oh, no, no, it's fine.

496
00:19:24,397 --> 00:19:25,607
I had three surgeries,

497
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:27,698
including an emergency
C. At 28 weeks.

498
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:28,767
Baby's fine.

499
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:30,167
Oh, that's great.

500
00:19:30,236 --> 00:19:31,502
Yeah, it is. It was.

501
00:19:31,571 --> 00:19:33,203
And so are you.

502
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:37,157
And I wanted to say
something in person,

503
00:19:37,226 --> 00:19:39,593
um, but I'm...

504
00:19:39,662 --> 00:19:41,774
Okay, I'm just nervous,
so I'm just gonna say it.

505
00:19:41,798 --> 00:19:43,142
So, we're gonna look at houses,

506
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:45,144
and there's gonna be
that awkward conversation

507
00:19:45,168 --> 00:19:47,145
about how many bedrooms we need,

508
00:19:47,169 --> 00:19:48,947
awkward because
this is kind of new

509
00:19:48,971 --> 00:19:50,949
and we haven't really
talked about kids,

510
00:19:50,973 --> 00:19:54,358
and houses have bedrooms,
and kids go in bedrooms.

511
00:19:54,426 --> 00:19:56,360
So, um, okay, I'm just gonna...

512
00:19:57,496 --> 00:19:59,663
I would like two
kids, maybe three,

513
00:19:59,732 --> 00:20:04,635
and I plan on not working
until they're in school

514
00:20:04,687 --> 00:20:08,288
and being the kind of mom
that walks them to school,

515
00:20:08,357 --> 00:20:10,975
so I need a good
school district.

516
00:20:12,478 --> 00:20:14,962
I'm freaking you out.

517
00:20:15,031 --> 00:20:16,609
Um... Crap.

518
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:18,315
When I went
over this in the car,

519
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:23,554
uh, it didn't sound so "marry
me and sire my children."

520
00:20:23,623 --> 00:20:24,950
It was reasonable.

521
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:27,708
No, it...

522
00:20:27,777 --> 00:20:30,277
It is.

523
00:20:30,346 --> 00:20:32,162
You should be
talking about this stuff.

524
00:20:32,214 --> 00:20:33,547
Good.

525
00:20:33,615 --> 00:20:34,776
Hmm. I'm not crazy.

526
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,151
Mnh-mnh, no, you're not crazy.

527
00:20:37,219 --> 00:20:39,053
Okay, then.

528
00:20:39,121 --> 00:20:40,498
So, I'll meet you
back here tonight,

529
00:20:40,522 --> 00:20:41,983
and we'll go to the
real-estate agent.

530
00:20:42,007 --> 00:20:43,401
Yeah. Okay.

531
00:20:43,425 --> 00:20:44,692
Bye.

532
00:20:49,065 --> 00:20:51,232
It's time to rethink the plan.

533
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,344
Hey. What did you find?

534
00:20:52,368 --> 00:20:55,819
Oh, Rory has
Li-Fraumeni Syndrome.

535
00:20:55,871 --> 00:20:57,666
Li for what? Never
even heard of it.

536
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:58,756
Neither had I.

537
00:20:58,825 --> 00:21:00,791
It's an extremely
rare genetic condition

538
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:03,861
due to a mutation
in the P53 gene

539
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:06,764
that suppresses the ability
to regulate cell growth.

540
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:08,699
The poor kid can't
fight off tumors.

541
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:11,302
So, as soon as you cure one
cancer, another one pops up.

542
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:12,847
Yeah. That's awesome.

543
00:21:12,871 --> 00:21:14,316
Now, I'm meeting
with the family today.

544
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:15,517
I'd like to be able to tell them

545
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:16,952
we have some sort of
plan in place for Rory.

546
00:21:16,976 --> 00:21:18,703
Okay, so, that chest tumor
might not even be a met

547
00:21:18,727 --> 00:21:19,793
from the osteosarcoma.

548
00:21:19,862 --> 00:21:21,740
That makes chemo that
much more complicated.

549
00:21:21,764 --> 00:21:23,508
Okay, the tumor in
her leg should respond

550
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:25,327
to doxorubicin, plus cisplatin.

551
00:21:25,351 --> 00:21:26,550
Radiation's out.

552
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:29,052
It would make her too
susceptible to new tumors.

553
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,361
The chest tumor's so vascular,

554
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:32,217
even a biopsy would
be pushing our luck.

555
00:21:32,241 --> 00:21:34,041
How rare is this?

556
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:35,809
Only a few hundred families

557
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:37,211
are reported in the literature.

558
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,512
We need those case studies,

559
00:21:38,581 --> 00:21:40,848
but, I mean, that
could take awhile.

560
00:21:40,917 --> 00:21:43,467
Not if I get those
residents on it.

561
00:21:46,905 --> 00:21:48,950
Sorry I'm late. I'm
doing scut for Hunt.

562
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:50,686
Well, it'll get handled.
This is more important.

563
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:51,742
All right, listen up.

564
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:53,377
Your assignment's changed.

565
00:21:53,429 --> 00:21:55,913
Rory has Li-Fraumeni Syndrome.

566
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:57,014
It's rare.

567
00:21:57,082 --> 00:21:58,932
Dig up every case
of it you can find.

568
00:21:59,001 --> 00:22:00,245
Find out what
worked, what didn't.

569
00:22:00,269 --> 00:22:02,203
I want one of you
to look for Dr. Karev.

570
00:22:02,271 --> 00:22:03,403
He's with the oncologist.

571
00:22:03,472 --> 00:22:04,488
I will.

572
00:22:04,557 --> 00:22:05,623
Are you sure?

573
00:22:05,691 --> 00:22:07,424
Yeah. Got to face him sometime.

574
00:22:09,111 --> 00:22:12,245
Now, you can't rely
solely on the Internet.

575
00:22:12,314 --> 00:22:14,781
Hit the library.

576
00:22:16,101 --> 00:22:17,951
Now.

577
00:22:19,388 --> 00:22:21,221
Uh, Ross, a word?

578
00:22:24,893 --> 00:22:26,710
You've been quiet.

579
00:22:26,763 --> 00:22:29,362
I don't know what's
going on in your head,

580
00:22:29,432 --> 00:22:31,314
but if it's too soon to
come back full time,

581
00:22:31,384 --> 00:22:33,283
we can talk. No.

582
00:22:33,353 --> 00:22:35,447
Just trying to keep my
head down and work, sir.

583
00:22:35,471 --> 00:22:37,537
Well, if you feel like you
have something to say,

584
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:38,806
speak up, son.

585
00:22:38,874 --> 00:22:41,141
Keeping it inside won't
help you or anyone else.

586
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:43,188
The last time I spoke
up, a patient nearly died.

587
00:22:43,212 --> 00:22:45,346
That was grief and
exhaustion talking.

588
00:22:46,816 --> 00:22:48,715
I'd like to hear you talk.

589
00:22:54,523 --> 00:22:56,056
Thank you. Of course.

590
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:58,303
You should put me
back in OR rotation.

591
00:22:58,327 --> 00:23:00,072
Start clipping aneurysms again.

592
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:01,807
Derek. Hey.

593
00:23:01,831 --> 00:23:03,363
Dr. Hunt.

594
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:06,445
Well, it would be
good to have you back.

595
00:23:06,469 --> 00:23:08,279
It used to be all
I wanted to do.

596
00:23:08,303 --> 00:23:10,348
I'm grateful that they
approached me for the project

597
00:23:10,372 --> 00:23:11,867
and that you
pushed me towards it.

598
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:13,452
It wasn't about Washington
or the accolades.

599
00:23:13,476 --> 00:23:14,775
They're looking for answers

600
00:23:14,844 --> 00:23:16,844
to questions I've been
asking my whole career.

601
00:23:16,912 --> 00:23:18,740
And to know that that
project is out there...

602
00:23:18,764 --> 00:23:20,342
I mean, how do I go
back to being satisfied

603
00:23:20,366 --> 00:23:21,410
doing neurosurgery again?

604
00:23:21,434 --> 00:23:22,533
Yeah.

605
00:23:23,636 --> 00:23:25,953
Your standards have changed.

606
00:23:26,022 --> 00:23:27,454
Yeah.

607
00:23:27,523 --> 00:23:29,306
My standards have changed.

608
00:23:33,846 --> 00:23:35,746
We were able to
clean it out in surgery,

609
00:23:35,815 --> 00:23:38,449
and now we're gonna let this
vacuum dressing work its magic

610
00:23:38,517 --> 00:23:40,283
and start the healing process.

611
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:43,404
Oh, my God, those are beautiful.

612
00:23:43,472 --> 00:23:44,650
Did Ted send them?

613
00:23:44,674 --> 00:23:46,674
No.

614
00:23:46,742 --> 00:23:48,292
They're from your mom.

615
00:23:49,795 --> 00:23:51,778
Oh, damn it, Lisa. Really?

616
00:23:51,848 --> 00:23:53,413
No, it's not Ted.

617
00:23:53,482 --> 00:23:55,032
I mean, it is Ted.

618
00:23:55,101 --> 00:23:56,533
You're right. I'm insane.

619
00:23:56,602 --> 00:23:58,163
This whole thing has
made me certifiably crazy.

620
00:23:58,187 --> 00:23:59,619
I am a college professor.

621
00:23:59,689 --> 00:24:01,116
I'm supposed to
be, you know, smart,

622
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,984
but instead I'm
jumping into trash chutes

623
00:24:03,008 --> 00:24:05,387
and bursting into tears
because I'm heartbroken

624
00:24:05,411 --> 00:24:07,389
that my mom cares about
me more than some jerk

625
00:24:07,413 --> 00:24:08,490
who won't even
talk to me in public!

626
00:24:08,514 --> 00:24:09,680
What is that?

627
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:12,315
Can you hand me my phone?

628
00:24:12,384 --> 00:24:14,580
I just want to call my mom
and thank her for the flowers.

629
00:24:14,604 --> 00:24:17,104
Sure.

630
00:24:20,409 --> 00:24:22,449
You're gonna call
Ted, aren't you?

631
00:24:27,332 --> 00:24:28,632
I'm a monster.

632
00:24:28,701 --> 00:24:30,433
Oh, my God.

633
00:24:35,774 --> 00:24:37,374
Hey, hey, hey.

634
00:24:37,443 --> 00:24:40,677
Oh, my God, we need to go
public with this thing, okay?

635
00:24:40,746 --> 00:24:42,612
I can't keep track
of when and where

636
00:24:42,681 --> 00:24:44,841
I can put my arms
on my own wife.

637
00:24:48,036 --> 00:24:50,170
Look. I know it's hard.

638
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:52,606
But the whispers and the
stares after the wedding

639
00:24:52,675 --> 00:24:54,408
have just started to die down.

640
00:24:54,477 --> 00:24:56,388
As soon as we tell people,
they're just gonna start up again.

641
00:24:56,412 --> 00:24:57,628
Yeah.

642
00:24:57,697 --> 00:25:03,166
Plus, I like our secret,
little marriage bubble.

643
00:25:03,235 --> 00:25:06,236
Sneaking around is kind of sexy.

644
00:25:06,305 --> 00:25:09,339
I am so proud
that you're my wife.

645
00:25:09,408 --> 00:25:12,459
I am married to a brilliant,
gorgeous trauma surgeon,

646
00:25:12,527 --> 00:25:15,195
and I just don't want to
hide it anymore, you know?

647
00:25:15,263 --> 00:25:17,614
Okay, that's even sexier.

648
00:25:18,734 --> 00:25:20,667
So, what do we do?

649
00:25:20,736 --> 00:25:23,696
I think we should
start telling people.

650
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:26,924
In a more controlled setting.

651
00:25:26,976 --> 00:25:30,410
Just... Doctor.

652
00:25:30,479 --> 00:25:31,578
Well, it looks like

653
00:25:31,646 --> 00:25:33,546
we're gonna get you
started on chemo soon.

654
00:25:33,616 --> 00:25:36,382
I saw Mom talking to Dr. Bailey.

655
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:38,051
There were tears.

656
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,152
Oh, wow.

657
00:25:39,221 --> 00:25:41,221
Thanks for the
cancer genes, Mom.

658
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:42,467
If you have it, I have it.

659
00:25:42,491 --> 00:25:44,992
Oh, you haven't been
sick a day in your life.

660
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:46,793
You have Dad's nice, safe genes.

661
00:25:46,862 --> 00:25:48,161
Maybe not.

662
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:49,746
We'll find out after the test.

663
00:25:49,815 --> 00:25:53,951
You know, you don't have
to find out if you don't want to.

664
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:55,118
Knowledge sucks.

665
00:25:55,171 --> 00:25:56,936
Your face sucks.

666
00:25:57,005 --> 00:25:59,923
Oh, come on. I'm not kidding.

667
00:25:59,992 --> 00:26:02,593
I know we like to act
like this isn't a big deal

668
00:26:02,661 --> 00:26:04,444
and we're the family
that beats cancer,

669
00:26:04,513 --> 00:26:07,714
but we're not actually
beating anything.

670
00:26:07,782 --> 00:26:11,051
I mean, like, I can handle
one cancer at a time,

671
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:13,287
but it's all I see now...

672
00:26:13,355 --> 00:26:16,423
Just cancer after
cancer until I'm dead.

673
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:20,026
And I wish I could go
back and un-know that.

674
00:26:21,998 --> 00:26:24,597
She can say no, right?

675
00:26:24,667 --> 00:26:27,651
It's her decision.

676
00:26:27,703 --> 00:26:30,404
Not according to Mom and Dad.

677
00:26:30,472 --> 00:26:32,950
They say I need to know
because it'll determine

678
00:26:32,974 --> 00:26:34,308
whether I take an aspirin

679
00:26:34,376 --> 00:26:36,843
or get a brain scan
for a headache.

680
00:26:36,912 --> 00:26:38,756
And if I'm gonna have
kids, I need to know...

681
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:40,214
Kids? You're a kid.

682
00:26:40,299 --> 00:26:42,499
I'm just saying, all right?

683
00:26:42,567 --> 00:26:44,501
Mom and Dad are freaking out,

684
00:26:44,569 --> 00:26:46,164
and they're calling
the whole damn family

685
00:26:46,188 --> 00:26:47,866
and wanting
everyone to get a test

686
00:26:47,890 --> 00:26:50,210
and wanting to
start a foundation

687
00:26:50,258 --> 00:26:51,692
and change the world

688
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,494
and be like the family
that fights Li-Fraumeni.

689
00:26:54,563 --> 00:26:57,831
Who cares what they
want? What do you want?

690
00:27:00,302 --> 00:27:03,236
I can really decide for myself?

691
00:27:03,305 --> 00:27:04,938
Even though I'm only 16

692
00:27:05,007 --> 00:27:06,468
and my parents
say that I have to?

693
00:27:06,492 --> 00:27:09,993
I can say no? I can
make the decision?

694
00:27:10,062 --> 00:27:11,695
It's your life.

695
00:27:11,764 --> 00:27:14,097
Nobody can make you do
anything you don't want to do.

696
00:27:24,693 --> 00:27:27,439
Hey. I need the
oncology report on Rory.

697
00:27:27,463 --> 00:27:29,028
They said we should
add methotrexate

698
00:27:29,097 --> 00:27:30,097
for the osteosarcoma.

699
00:27:30,165 --> 00:27:31,509
Okay, thanks. Look...

700
00:27:31,533 --> 00:27:32,832
Hey, what are you doing?

701
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:34,068
I'm done sneaking around.

702
00:27:34,136 --> 00:27:36,070
They can't tell us what
to do or what to feel.

703
00:27:36,138 --> 00:27:37,620
If they want to fire me, fine.

704
00:27:41,927 --> 00:27:43,694
We had a plan. What happened?

705
00:27:43,762 --> 00:27:44,873
Look. It's a stupid plan.

706
00:27:44,897 --> 00:27:46,424
We're adults. We
love each other.

707
00:27:46,448 --> 00:27:48,598
They can go screw themselves.

708
00:27:49,735 --> 00:27:50,735
What was that?

709
00:27:50,802 --> 00:27:52,042
Is somebody in there?

710
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:53,604
Hey, guys.

711
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:55,339
You want to just
hand me my shirt?

712
00:27:57,192 --> 00:27:58,459
Mine, too.

713
00:28:00,078 --> 00:28:01,111
Hi. Appreciate it.

714
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:02,179
Ugh.

715
00:28:02,247 --> 00:28:04,598
Come on. Let's get out of here.

716
00:28:04,666 --> 00:28:07,067
No! Oh!

717
00:28:07,136 --> 00:28:11,238
Dr. Webber. This
isn't what it looks like.

718
00:28:20,966 --> 00:28:22,032
Well, I'm fired.

719
00:28:22,101 --> 00:28:23,283
We're not fired.

720
00:28:23,352 --> 00:28:24,846
You're not. You're an attending.

721
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:26,803
I'm an expendable resident.

722
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:28,249
The rules are just a
dumb thing on paper

723
00:28:28,273 --> 00:28:30,390
to cover the board's ass.
No one actually cares.

724
00:28:30,459 --> 00:28:31,758
Well, speaking

725
00:28:31,827 --> 00:28:33,304
as the hypocritical board
member in the room,

726
00:28:33,328 --> 00:28:34,438
the board cares.

727
00:28:34,462 --> 00:28:35,674
Since when are
you two still doing it?

728
00:28:35,698 --> 00:28:36,874
Since the wedding.

729
00:28:36,898 --> 00:28:38,765
Nice.

730
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:40,934
What?

731
00:28:41,002 --> 00:28:42,297
I'm deciding whether
this makes me

732
00:28:42,321 --> 00:28:43,453
hate you more or less.

733
00:28:43,522 --> 00:28:45,442
More.

734
00:28:45,507 --> 00:28:48,358
Hey, well, um, since
we have you guys here,

735
00:28:48,427 --> 00:28:50,088
there's something that
we wanted to... Oh, no.

736
00:28:50,112 --> 00:28:51,511
Think he's still out there?

737
00:28:51,579 --> 00:28:53,813
There's only one
way to find out.

738
00:28:59,605 --> 00:29:01,438
You guys want to close the...

739
00:29:01,506 --> 00:29:02,889
No?

740
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:09,796
Hey.

741
00:29:09,865 --> 00:29:11,075
Hey. I need a consult.

742
00:29:11,099 --> 00:29:12,199
Okay.

743
00:29:12,267 --> 00:29:13,478
So, my project
is at a standstill

744
00:29:13,502 --> 00:29:15,935
unless I hand it
over to a bioengineer.

745
00:29:16,005 --> 00:29:17,070
Okay.

746
00:29:17,139 --> 00:29:18,872
What's your pitch?

747
00:29:19,775 --> 00:29:21,041
Become a bioengineer.

748
00:29:22,578 --> 00:29:24,222
I can't give Derek
the satisfaction

749
00:29:24,246 --> 00:29:25,662
of lightening my workload

750
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:28,164
because his guilt is
my only ray of sunshine.

751
00:29:28,233 --> 00:29:29,711
Well, he doesn't think
he's gonna get the job,

752
00:29:29,735 --> 00:29:31,401
if that makes you
feel any better.

753
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:33,347
I know. I actually feel
kind of bad for him.

754
00:29:33,371 --> 00:29:35,483
But I feel worse for
me. I hate quitting.

755
00:29:35,507 --> 00:29:37,607
Don't think of it as quitting.

756
00:29:37,676 --> 00:29:39,804
You're waiting for science
to catch up to your brilliance.

757
00:29:39,828 --> 00:29:41,394
Think of it as...

758
00:29:41,463 --> 00:29:45,098
As letting someone else
take your project out for a spin.

759
00:29:45,167 --> 00:29:47,600
You just step back, see
what else is out there,

760
00:29:47,669 --> 00:29:51,454
so when you come back to your
project, you'll have fresh eyes.

761
00:29:51,523 --> 00:29:55,592
It'll be better than ever,
just like coming home.

762
00:29:57,595 --> 00:29:59,496
You slept with Owen.

763
00:30:01,233 --> 00:30:03,967
Yes, I did.

764
00:30:04,036 --> 00:30:05,702
Don't.

765
00:30:10,459 --> 00:30:12,209
Karev, talk to me.

766
00:30:12,278 --> 00:30:14,222
She was hypertensive
and unresponsive,

767
00:30:14,246 --> 00:30:17,041
with absent breath sounds over
her left chest when I got here.

768
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:18,576
I needled for a tension pneumo.

769
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,077
Okay, we'll have
to get her intubated.

770
00:30:20,101 --> 00:30:21,201
Okay.

771
00:30:23,672 --> 00:30:24,832
Aah!

772
00:30:24,856 --> 00:30:26,551
Ariel, I need you to
go find your parents.

773
00:30:26,575 --> 00:30:27,669
I couldn't wake her up

774
00:30:27,693 --> 00:30:28,837
when the machine
started beeping.

775
00:30:28,861 --> 00:30:30,571
I tried, but... Look,
this is not your fault.

776
00:30:30,595 --> 00:30:31,940
We're gonna help
your sister, okay?

777
00:30:31,964 --> 00:30:35,265
Go find your parents. Go! Now!

778
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:37,401
Where the hell did all
this blood come from?

779
00:30:37,469 --> 00:30:40,454
Her tumor could have ruptured.
We've got to get her to an OR.

780
00:30:40,539 --> 00:30:43,673
Guys, I just found a case
of Li-Fraumeni in Chicago.

781
00:30:43,742 --> 00:30:46,709
The guy has almost the exact
same types of cancers as Rory.

782
00:30:46,778 --> 00:30:49,712
Uh, they tried neoadjuvant
chemo to shrink it,

783
00:30:49,781 --> 00:30:51,748
then surgery, and then, uh...

784
00:30:51,816 --> 00:30:53,050
And?

785
00:30:53,118 --> 00:30:55,152
And then he died.

786
00:30:57,289 --> 00:31:00,023
I'm really sorry for
what I'm about to say,

787
00:31:00,092 --> 00:31:02,070
and I want you to know
that I'm not trying to be mean,

788
00:31:02,094 --> 00:31:03,838
but I think that you
should hear it from me.

789
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:05,511
Okay.

790
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:07,980
Jackson and April
are still together.

791
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,049
What?

792
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:12,663
Webber just walked in on
Alex, me, and them in a closet.

793
00:31:12,687 --> 00:31:14,104
I'm confused.

794
00:31:14,172 --> 00:31:16,473
You know, I know that you
were trying to punish them

795
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:19,009
when you made your
complaint, but they're fine, Steph.

796
00:31:19,078 --> 00:31:20,318
They're great.

797
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:23,413
The only one who's
being punished is me!

798
00:31:23,481 --> 00:31:25,576
This is gonna force
Alex and me apart!

799
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,000
Didn't you guys just break up?

800
00:31:27,085 --> 00:31:28,146
No, we faked it.

801
00:31:28,170 --> 00:31:29,536
I'm so confused.

802
00:31:29,604 --> 00:31:30,815
You know what you do

803
00:31:30,839 --> 00:31:32,500
when your little heart
gets broken, Steph?

804
00:31:32,524 --> 00:31:34,369
You talk about it
with your friends.

805
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:36,410
You don't file a complaint!

806
00:31:36,478 --> 00:31:39,279
I don't know how many
times I have to tell you this.

807
00:31:39,347 --> 00:31:40,380
It was an...

808
00:31:40,448 --> 00:31:43,533
An anonymous
complaint, which you file

809
00:31:43,601 --> 00:31:45,986
because you're afraid if
people find out it was you,

810
00:31:46,054 --> 00:31:47,720
they'd treat you like crap

811
00:31:47,789 --> 00:31:50,223
instead of understanding
or even trying to understand

812
00:31:50,292 --> 00:31:52,392
that it wasn't some
frivolous thing you did

813
00:31:52,461 --> 00:31:54,439
because your little
heart got broken,

814
00:31:54,463 --> 00:31:56,947
but a decision you
made because you felt

815
00:31:57,016 --> 00:32:00,651
like your medical education
had been compromised.

816
00:32:00,719 --> 00:32:02,180
God, I don't even
know why I bothered.

817
00:32:02,204 --> 00:32:04,048
I should have just
signed my name.

818
00:32:04,072 --> 00:32:05,405
Oh!

819
00:32:18,086 --> 00:32:22,322
This job is a
privilege and a gift,

820
00:32:22,391 --> 00:32:25,142
and we are squandering it.

821
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:27,894
I almost lost my
place in this program

822
00:32:27,962 --> 00:32:32,098
because I got
distracted with Dr. Yang.

823
00:32:32,167 --> 00:32:34,668
And you are all
letting distractions

824
00:32:34,737 --> 00:32:37,420
get in the way of our work.

825
00:32:39,975 --> 00:32:41,707
We have a chance here

826
00:32:41,776 --> 00:32:43,910
to actually save this girl.

827
00:32:45,547 --> 00:32:47,864
And I have an idea.

828
00:32:48,734 --> 00:32:49,982
Look.

829
00:32:52,087 --> 00:32:53,327
You slept with Yang?

830
00:32:56,174 --> 00:32:57,874
The anatomy's all messed up.

831
00:32:57,942 --> 00:32:59,354
The tumor's stuck
to everything in here.

832
00:32:59,378 --> 00:33:00,378
Okay.

833
00:33:00,445 --> 00:33:02,345
Let's try clamping the aorta.

834
00:33:02,414 --> 00:33:04,614
That may temporarily
help curb the bleeding.

835
00:33:07,052 --> 00:33:10,187
Now I just have to find it.

836
00:33:10,255 --> 00:33:12,605
This patient survived
six types of cancers.

837
00:33:12,674 --> 00:33:14,073
They were onto something.

838
00:33:14,142 --> 00:33:15,887
Yeah, but then he died
from a surgical complication.

839
00:33:15,911 --> 00:33:18,344
So, if we combined
radiofrequency ablation

840
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:20,713
with an anterior-approach
en bloc resection...

841
00:33:20,782 --> 00:33:22,148
Yes.

842
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:25,935
V-fib. Starting cardiac massage.

843
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:28,604
Charge the paddles to 10.

844
00:33:30,992 --> 00:33:32,008
No, no, no.

845
00:33:32,077 --> 00:33:33,443
Look. Look. Look.

846
00:33:33,512 --> 00:33:35,223
This gives us
good local control.

847
00:33:35,247 --> 00:33:36,646
So we can treat the tumor

848
00:33:36,715 --> 00:33:37,647
without compromising
the healthy lung tissue.

849
00:33:37,716 --> 00:33:38,748
Exactly.

850
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:40,199
Okay, charge to 20.

851
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:42,168
Clear.

852
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,551
All right. We got a rhythm.

853
00:33:46,575 --> 00:33:48,625
It's weak, but it'll do.

854
00:33:48,694 --> 00:33:50,371
Okay, let's get in there
and find the source.

855
00:33:50,395 --> 00:33:52,090
And we can get a
biopsy while we're in there

856
00:33:52,114 --> 00:33:53,892
to customize the chemo
to her specific tumor.

857
00:33:53,916 --> 00:33:55,248
This will work, guys.

858
00:33:55,317 --> 00:33:56,416
Yeah.

859
00:33:56,484 --> 00:33:57,818
Let's go tell Webber.

860
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:10,213
We got it! We figured it out!

861
00:34:10,281 --> 00:34:12,215
You start with
radiofrequency ablation.

862
00:34:12,283 --> 00:34:13,628
Then you take the
remainder out en bloc.

863
00:34:13,652 --> 00:34:15,179
And the healthy
tissue remains healthy.

864
00:34:15,203 --> 00:34:16,319
Guys...

865
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:17,598
But here's a twist,
you can do a biopsy.

866
00:34:17,622 --> 00:34:18,733
Which will customize her chemo.

867
00:34:18,757 --> 00:34:19,989
That's not gonna work.

868
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:21,085
It might have.

869
00:34:21,109 --> 00:34:22,642
It's a worthy pitch,

870
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:25,128
but Rory bled out
into her chest tonight.

871
00:34:25,197 --> 00:34:27,880
It looks like it
tore into her aorta.

872
00:34:27,949 --> 00:34:29,332
We did everything we could.

873
00:34:29,401 --> 00:34:31,000
She died?

874
00:34:32,036 --> 00:34:33,156
She died.

875
00:34:59,464 --> 00:35:00,563
We tried everything.

876
00:35:00,632 --> 00:35:01,932
No.

877
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,433
Oh, my God.

878
00:35:03,501 --> 00:35:05,802
We're so sorry.

879
00:35:05,854 --> 00:35:07,603
Oh! Oh!

880
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:14,344
Do I have it?

881
00:35:14,396 --> 00:35:16,329
The gene... I want
to know if I have it.

882
00:35:16,398 --> 00:35:17,575
No, honey. Now is not the time.

883
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:18,839
No, now is the time, Mom.

884
00:35:18,901 --> 00:35:21,117
I want to know.

885
00:35:21,186 --> 00:35:23,420
You know.

886
00:35:23,488 --> 00:35:24,737
Dr. Bailey told you.

887
00:35:24,806 --> 00:35:26,172
Ariel.

888
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,091
Do I have it?

889
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:31,128
Yeah.

890
00:35:35,167 --> 00:35:37,601
It's okay. It's okay, Mom.

891
00:35:37,669 --> 00:35:39,447
I always wanted to be
like her, and now I am.

892
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:41,571
I'm just like Rory.

893
00:35:50,365 --> 00:35:52,381
Shh.

894
00:35:55,053 --> 00:35:57,187
Really? Webber told on us?

895
00:35:57,255 --> 00:35:59,388
None of us want
to be here, Karev.

896
00:35:59,457 --> 00:36:00,924
Then why are we?

897
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:01,774
You're having a relationship
with a subordinate,

898
00:36:01,843 --> 00:36:03,142
and that is against policy.

899
00:36:03,211 --> 00:36:04,572
Can we not talk
about my personal life?

900
00:36:04,596 --> 00:36:06,329
I'd love to not
talk about it, Alex,

901
00:36:06,398 --> 00:36:08,164
but you are making me.

902
00:36:08,233 --> 00:36:09,877
Now, I realize that we cannot
legislate for romantic feelings.

903
00:36:09,901 --> 00:36:12,919
Okay, obviously, what you do
at home is your own business.

904
00:36:12,988 --> 00:36:14,432
Look, we're just
asking that, at work,

905
00:36:14,456 --> 00:36:15,783
things remain
strictly professional.

906
00:36:15,807 --> 00:36:17,501
Oh, that's crap! Alex.

907
00:36:17,525 --> 00:36:18,903
Oh, it's okay for
you all to flaunt

908
00:36:18,927 --> 00:36:20,743
your relationships
and your rings

909
00:36:20,812 --> 00:36:22,295
and your happy, little lives

910
00:36:22,363 --> 00:36:23,525
just because you're married?

911
00:36:23,549 --> 00:36:24,809
Karev, just sit down. No!

912
00:36:24,833 --> 00:36:26,510
I'm not gonna let a
bunch of hypocrites

913
00:36:26,534 --> 00:36:28,145
tell me to keep my
pants on at work

914
00:36:28,169 --> 00:36:29,647
when this place
was built on all of you

915
00:36:29,671 --> 00:36:31,749
feeling each other
up in our on-call room!

916
00:36:31,773 --> 00:36:34,440
I'm done! Punish me! Whatever!

917
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:46,019
Okay, so, this is not how we
wanted to tell you guys this,

918
00:36:46,088 --> 00:36:47,520
because it could look like

919
00:36:47,589 --> 00:36:48,833
we're trying to
get off the hook,

920
00:36:48,857 --> 00:36:50,090
which we are not.

921
00:36:50,158 --> 00:36:51,257
But we...

922
00:36:51,326 --> 00:36:52,370
We are married.

923
00:36:52,394 --> 00:36:53,743
What?

924
00:36:53,811 --> 00:36:55,511
Yes, April is my wife.

925
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:58,582
So, our supply-closet
activity breaks no rules.

926
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:00,383
Since when?

927
00:37:00,452 --> 00:37:01,551
Since the wedding.

928
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:02,952
My other wedding.

929
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,954
Kepner, you continue
to surprise me.

930
00:37:05,023 --> 00:37:06,289
Mm-hmm.

931
00:37:06,358 --> 00:37:08,842
Um, Congratulations.

932
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:10,543
Thank you.

933
00:37:10,612 --> 00:37:11,627
Okay.

934
00:37:11,696 --> 00:37:13,412
So, I should probably go.

935
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:15,982
I'm so sorry. Good luck.

936
00:37:22,908 --> 00:37:25,041
Filing that complaint
really took balls,

937
00:37:25,109 --> 00:37:26,320
balls I didn't have.

938
00:37:26,344 --> 00:37:28,311
Jo's gonna be so
pissed at me, isn't she?

939
00:37:28,379 --> 00:37:30,146
Oh, yeah, she is.

940
00:37:30,214 --> 00:37:31,815
Hide at the bar?

941
00:37:31,883 --> 00:37:32,982
Yes, please.

942
00:37:33,051 --> 00:37:34,094
All right.

943
00:37:34,118 --> 00:37:36,686
Shane, we're
drinking. You're coming.

944
00:37:38,056 --> 00:37:40,523
<i>You can try to
hide from a bully.</i>

945
00:37:40,592 --> 00:37:42,959
<i>But hiding won't work for long.</i>

946
00:37:43,027 --> 00:37:45,105
You're gonna send her
flowers, you're gonna apologize,

947
00:37:45,129 --> 00:37:47,764
and then you are never
going to see her again.

948
00:37:47,833 --> 00:37:49,766
Oh, I'll take this outside.

949
00:37:49,835 --> 00:37:51,033
Okay.

950
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:52,713
Oh, uh, tell him he
kisses like a turtle's butt.

951
00:37:52,737 --> 00:37:54,214
Is she breaking
up with him for you?

952
00:37:54,238 --> 00:37:56,305
I can't be trusted
to do it. I'm crazy.

953
00:37:56,374 --> 00:37:58,007
But the first step is admitting

954
00:37:58,076 --> 00:37:59,609
you have a problem, right?

955
00:37:59,678 --> 00:38:02,312
No more secret romances,
no more married men.

956
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:04,981
Hey.

957
00:38:05,049 --> 00:38:06,549
What are you doing this weekend?

958
00:38:06,618 --> 00:38:08,150
You're beautiful.

959
00:38:08,219 --> 00:38:10,019
And you've already
seen me naked.

960
00:38:10,087 --> 00:38:13,372
So, you might as
well buy me dinner.

961
00:38:16,978 --> 00:38:21,647
Well, I actually already
have plans with my wife, so...

962
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:24,734
Stuck in a trash chute, check.

963
00:38:24,803 --> 00:38:26,869
Prawn stuck in my leg, check.

964
00:38:26,938 --> 00:38:29,872
Embarrass myself in front of
my surgeons, double check.

965
00:38:29,941 --> 00:38:32,758
Yeah. That about
sounds right. I can die now.

966
00:38:35,897 --> 00:38:38,047
You know, he really
should wear a ring.

967
00:38:38,116 --> 00:38:39,215
It's not fair,

968
00:38:39,284 --> 00:38:41,050
going around looking
like that without one.

969
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:43,286
Totally agree.

970
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:47,768
<i>There's really only
one way to win.</i>

971
00:38:47,792 --> 00:38:49,125
It's an interesting idea.

972
00:38:49,194 --> 00:38:50,426
Mm-hmm.

973
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:52,662
I wish we'd had a
chance to give it a try.

974
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:54,142
You know, but maybe
we'll be ahead of the game

975
00:38:54,166 --> 00:38:55,166
for her sister.

976
00:38:55,233 --> 00:38:57,167
It was a team effort.

977
00:38:57,235 --> 00:38:58,979
I don't want to get ahead of
myself, but I think I'm starting

978
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:00,181
to make some
headway with those kids.

979
00:39:00,205 --> 00:39:01,237
Oh.

980
00:39:01,306 --> 00:39:02,572
Warren!

981
00:39:02,641 --> 00:39:04,084
Dr. Bailey, we're
gonna go to Joe's.

982
00:39:04,108 --> 00:39:05,348
You mind? Can Ben come?

983
00:39:07,162 --> 00:39:08,928
Go on.

984
00:39:08,997 --> 00:39:10,580
Go play with your friends.

985
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:19,355
But don't stay out too late.

986
00:39:27,849 --> 00:39:29,527
Sure you want to come? Mmm.

987
00:39:29,551 --> 00:39:30,683
Just rub that in our faces.

988
00:39:30,752 --> 00:39:32,117
I'm gonna come out.

989
00:39:32,186 --> 00:39:34,106
Believe me... I'm
gonna get home tonight.

990
00:39:35,339 --> 00:39:36,984
<i>You have to fight back.</i>

991
00:39:37,008 --> 00:39:38,590
I don't understand.

992
00:39:38,659 --> 00:39:41,945
This morning, we were making
plans to see houses together,

993
00:39:42,013 --> 00:39:44,614
and now you want to break up.

994
00:39:44,682 --> 00:39:46,415
I thought I knew what I wanted.

995
00:39:46,484 --> 00:39:48,618
What, the house,
the kids, or me?

996
00:39:48,686 --> 00:39:49,769
Emma, I am so sorry.

997
00:39:49,838 --> 00:39:50,881
Don't.

998
00:39:50,905 --> 00:39:52,605
I don't need an apology.

999
00:39:52,673 --> 00:39:54,707
I want an explanation

1000
00:39:54,775 --> 00:39:57,121
because the last time I
checked, which was this morning,

1001
00:39:57,145 --> 00:40:00,091
we were on the exact same
page, and now we're not.

1002
00:40:00,115 --> 00:40:01,355
What changed?

1003
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:06,452
I want to come home
to someone at night

1004
00:40:06,521 --> 00:40:10,723
who is equally as
passionate about their work...

1005
00:40:10,792 --> 00:40:12,125
I am.

1006
00:40:12,193 --> 00:40:14,160
Emma, you...

1007
00:40:14,228 --> 00:40:19,966
You would give up surgery
in exchange for a family.

1008
00:40:21,285 --> 00:40:22,362
That's a problem?

1009
00:40:22,386 --> 00:40:25,788
No. No, it's amazing for you.

1010
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:27,790
I want you to have that...

1011
00:40:27,858 --> 00:40:30,359
house with the
bedrooms and the kids.

1012
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:34,530
It is a beautiful future.

1013
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:36,999
But I want to come home at night

1014
00:40:37,068 --> 00:40:40,970
and exchange OR stories.

1015
00:40:43,074 --> 00:40:44,507
We want different things.

1016
00:40:47,813 --> 00:40:49,044
So it's me.

1017
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:51,697
Emma, come on.

1018
00:40:51,766 --> 00:40:53,099
Please. Just please let me go.

1019
00:40:53,167 --> 00:40:54,233
Emma, Emma...

1020
00:40:54,302 --> 00:40:55,345
I'm gonna call a cab.

1021
00:40:55,369 --> 00:40:58,788
Will you wait a few minutes

1022
00:40:58,857 --> 00:41:01,217
so that I'm gone
before you leave?

1023
00:41:09,434 --> 00:41:11,954
<i>And if you're lucky
enough to get out alive,</i>

1024
00:41:16,541 --> 00:41:19,075
<i>take just a moment
to celebrate...</i>

1025
00:41:19,144 --> 00:41:20,910
The White House called.

1026
00:41:20,979 --> 00:41:22,212
You got it?

1027
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,847
No, it's much bigger than that.

1028
00:41:23,915 --> 00:41:26,961
That's why the interview
process was so exhaustive.

1029
00:41:26,985 --> 00:41:29,652
They want me on
the advisory board.

1030
00:41:29,721 --> 00:41:31,220
They want me to run the thing.

1031
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:33,723
You're mad.

1032
00:41:33,792 --> 00:41:36,142
No.

1033
00:41:36,211 --> 00:41:37,543
I'm not mad.

1034
00:41:37,612 --> 00:41:40,313
I just... I'm happy for you.

1035
00:41:40,382 --> 00:41:41,547
But there isn't room

1036
00:41:41,616 --> 00:41:43,327
for me to take my
career to the next level

1037
00:41:43,351 --> 00:41:45,385
and for you to run the thing.

1038
00:41:45,453 --> 00:41:47,703
Derek, that's frustrating.

1039
00:41:47,772 --> 00:41:48,804
Mm-hmm.

1040
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:53,359
Come here.

1041
00:41:53,428 --> 00:41:54,777
What are you doing?

1042
00:41:54,846 --> 00:41:56,223
I'm gonna have sex
with my husband... Oh.

1043
00:41:56,247 --> 00:41:57,947
Because three weeks is too long.

1044
00:41:58,016 --> 00:41:59,399
And I guess I do find

1045
00:41:59,467 --> 00:42:01,467
presidential
appointments very sexy.

1046
00:42:01,535 --> 00:42:02,719
Mmm.

1047
00:42:02,787 --> 00:42:03,931
And then we can
fight more later.

1048
00:42:03,955 --> 00:42:05,287
Good. All right.

1049
00:42:06,841 --> 00:42:09,642
<i>Before you put
your guard back up,</i>

1050
00:42:09,711 --> 00:42:11,110
<i>ready to fight the next one.</i>
