1
00:00:02,436 --> 00:00:04,536
<i>Today's forecast, hey, mid 70s!</i>

2
00:00:04,605 --> 00:00:07,772
<i>Unseasonably warm and
clear in the Pacific Northwest.</i>

3
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:09,353
<i>It's gonna be a
great day, Seattle!</i>

4
00:00:09,377 --> 00:00:11,088
<i>He doesn't know
that. He's an idiot.</i>

5
00:00:11,112 --> 00:00:12,922
<i>It sounds like it's a
good day to get outside.</i>

6
00:00:12,946 --> 00:00:14,458
<i>For all he knows, it could
be the worst day of his life.</i>

7
00:00:14,482 --> 00:00:15,663
Why is that on?

8
00:00:15,732 --> 00:00:16,809
<i>Thanks, Len. Next up...</i>

9
00:00:16,833 --> 00:00:17,910
Oh, um... I wanted
to see the weather.

10
00:00:17,934 --> 00:00:19,134
I have to fly today.

11
00:00:19,202 --> 00:00:20,313
You've been saying
that for two weeks.

12
00:00:20,337 --> 00:00:21,570
Well, only because

13
00:00:21,639 --> 00:00:24,039
Link McNeil kept getting
close to getting a heart.

14
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:25,891
I really wanted to
see that through.

15
00:00:25,959 --> 00:00:27,976
I can't put off Zurich anymore.

16
00:00:28,045 --> 00:00:29,578
There is a staff
meeting on Monday,

17
00:00:29,647 --> 00:00:32,347
and if I'm not there, it'll be
a terrible first impression,

18
00:00:32,416 --> 00:00:34,800
and I'll lose control
before I start.

19
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:38,270
So, this is goodbye then?

20
00:00:39,557 --> 00:00:40,939
Last night wasn't enough?

21
00:00:40,991 --> 00:00:42,307
No. No.

22
00:00:43,077 --> 00:00:44,343
Come on. Come on. Come on.

23
00:00:44,411 --> 00:00:46,745
Owen, no, no. You
made me late already.

24
00:00:46,813 --> 00:00:48,146
No. Meredith made you late.

25
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:49,359
You were out drinking
till 2:00 in the morning.

26
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:50,983
Well, 'cause that
was our big goodbye.

27
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,735
Oh, we are not having
a big goodbye here.

28
00:00:53,804 --> 00:00:55,448
I'm gonna be at
the hospital later

29
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:57,772
to check on my last conduit kid.

30
00:00:57,841 --> 00:01:00,192
We have a big goodbye
here, and then I'll see you there,

31
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:04,045
and I'll feel all,
"Duh, bye, again."

32
00:01:04,114 --> 00:01:05,130
No, no, no, no, no.

33
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:06,238
I got to go. I got to go.

34
00:01:06,283 --> 00:01:07,915
<i>You know how people say,</i>

35
00:01:07,985 --> 00:01:09,896
<i>"Who knows? I could get
hit by a bus tomorrow?"</i>

36
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,131
<i>That seems pretty far-fetched...</i>

37
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:13,755
Oh, crap. Oh, crap!

38
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:15,390
Oh, no! My phone is dead!

39
00:01:15,459 --> 00:01:17,520
<i>Until you have a friend
who got hit by a bus.</i>

40
00:01:17,544 --> 00:01:19,438
And I need a European
charger. Cristina...

41
00:01:19,462 --> 00:01:21,262
Oh, no, now I have
to go to the stupid mall!

42
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,899
I'll see you later.

43
00:01:24,968 --> 00:01:26,401
<i>The point is,</i>

44
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:28,247
<i>we never know what
kind of day is coming.</i>

45
00:01:28,271 --> 00:01:29,705
How is everybody?

46
00:01:29,773 --> 00:01:32,140
So, Zozo's in her
room getting dressed,

47
00:01:32,208 --> 00:01:34,687
and this little guy just
pooped, so there's that.

48
00:01:34,711 --> 00:01:37,078
How was your flight?
Rough, but... Mwah.

49
00:01:37,147 --> 00:01:38,847
We have a place to live in DC.

50
00:01:38,916 --> 00:01:40,910
We got the townhouse
in Foggy Bottom.

51
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:42,328
We got it? We close in a month.

52
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:44,553
I just need you to
sign the paperwork.

53
00:01:44,622 --> 00:01:46,332
What is today? Is today
Tuesday? Today is Thursday.

54
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:48,322
Oh, good. Then
Amy's got my surgeries.

55
00:01:48,391 --> 00:01:49,735
I can sleep in all day. Okay,

56
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:51,171
but first, that guy
has a foggy bottom,

57
00:01:51,195 --> 00:01:52,405
and I can take a
look at these tonight.

58
00:01:52,429 --> 00:01:53,789
Hey, you want to look
at the brochure again

59
00:01:53,813 --> 00:01:56,047
and remind yourself
how much you love it?

60
00:01:59,787 --> 00:02:01,386
Oh, it's pretty!

61
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:03,266
It's the freaking
Batmobile is what it is.

62
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:04,472
It's either this or a boat.

63
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:05,835
Everybody at the
practice has a boat.

64
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:07,409
Are you really a boat guy?

65
00:02:07,478 --> 00:02:09,210
How should I know?
I never had a boat.

66
00:02:09,279 --> 00:02:11,563
Ooh. Are you looking
to buy a road-penis?

67
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:12,947
It's that or a boat.

68
00:02:13,016 --> 00:02:14,544
Oh, no, you don't
seem like a boat guy.

69
00:02:14,568 --> 00:02:16,668
What are you here
for? My first anoplasty.

70
00:02:16,736 --> 00:02:18,903
Wow. Is Lebackes grooming you?

71
00:02:18,973 --> 00:02:20,366
Are you gonna be
Dr. Junior Butthole?

72
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,574
Oh, no! That's
what they'll call you.

73
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:24,959
I won't hear them 'cause
I'll be squealing away in this.

74
00:02:25,028 --> 00:02:27,123
Congratulations,
Lil' Butthole. Thanks.

75
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,492
<i>Any thought on who will fill</i>

76
00:02:28,516 --> 00:02:30,215
the three empty
seats on the board?

77
00:02:30,283 --> 00:02:32,050
It's only one seat, actually.

78
00:02:32,119 --> 00:02:33,597
Shepherd and Grey
will keep their seats.

79
00:02:33,621 --> 00:02:35,515
They'll telecommute
from DC for meetings.

80
00:02:35,539 --> 00:02:36,883
Yang says she won't have time.

81
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:38,518
I think she just
wants a clean break.

82
00:02:38,542 --> 00:02:40,662
So that just leaves
her seat open.

83
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:42,127
Morning, gentlemen.

84
00:02:42,195 --> 00:02:43,428
You'll be happy to know

85
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,814
that former bubble
boy, Braden Morris,

86
00:02:45,882 --> 00:02:48,116
had his first follow-up
with his pediatrician.

87
00:02:48,185 --> 00:02:49,684
He is healthy as a horse.

88
00:02:49,753 --> 00:02:51,030
I have a consult,
if you'll excuse me.

89
00:02:51,054 --> 00:02:52,294
You can stay. You should...

90
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:56,308
What's up?

91
00:02:56,377 --> 00:02:57,587
Disappointing news, actually.

92
00:02:57,611 --> 00:02:59,127
The Foundation cut our budget,

93
00:02:59,196 --> 00:03:02,347
so we are unable to continue
funding your genome lab.

94
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:04,265
Oh, well, who's
gonna fund it, then?

95
00:03:04,334 --> 00:03:06,129
We're shutting
it down, actually.

96
00:03:06,153 --> 00:03:07,930
It's simply not producing the
results that other projects...

97
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:09,838
Did you not just
hear what I said?

98
00:03:09,907 --> 00:03:14,876
I gave an immunodeficient
child deactivated HIV.

99
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:16,294
And saved him!

100
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:18,174
And almost got the
hospital sued in the process.

101
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:20,515
And almost lost your
license and landed in jail.

102
00:03:20,584 --> 00:03:22,865
So is that really where
you want to plant your flag?

103
00:03:22,903 --> 00:03:24,085
Yes!

104
00:03:24,154 --> 00:03:26,187
And so should you!

105
00:03:26,256 --> 00:03:27,456
Hey, two years ago,

106
00:03:27,524 --> 00:03:29,658
I was wiping your butt
and changing your diaper,

107
00:03:29,727 --> 00:03:31,593
and now you want
to do this to me?

108
00:03:31,662 --> 00:03:33,611
No, no. I will not stand for it.

109
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,979
It's budgetary, and it's done.

110
00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:36,848
Won't stand for it!

111
00:03:36,917 --> 00:03:38,117
Hey, have you talked to Leah?

112
00:03:38,184 --> 00:03:39,918
Oh. Yeah.

113
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:42,165
She's still on her couch, still
depressed, eating everything.

114
00:03:42,189 --> 00:03:43,366
Has she said what
she's gonna do?

115
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,323
Won't even talk
about it. Catatonic.

116
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:46,575
What are you doing?

117
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,505
Just finished an aneurysm
clip with Dr. Shepherd.

118
00:03:48,529 --> 00:03:49,595
Shepherd or Shepherdess?

119
00:03:49,663 --> 00:03:50,796
Shepherdess.

120
00:03:50,864 --> 00:03:52,964
"Shepherdess"? Really?

121
00:03:53,032 --> 00:03:54,382
Sorry. It's just very confusing.

122
00:03:54,451 --> 00:03:56,129
I kind of like it. Shepherdess.

123
00:03:56,153 --> 00:03:58,833
Oh, well, before, it was
just "Shepherd's little sister."

124
00:04:00,024 --> 00:04:02,140
Edwards, do you
like working on neuro?

125
00:04:02,192 --> 00:04:05,505
Yeah. Don't ever
say that to me again.

126
00:04:05,529 --> 00:04:08,663
I emailed Dr. Yang twice
about the conduit babies,

127
00:04:08,732 --> 00:04:11,099
and her only response
was, "Not your problem."

128
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:13,246
I'm the head of
cardio. I'm her boss.

129
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:14,313
And the way that she
talks to me sometimes...

130
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:15,670
Look, Dr. Pierce, I...

131
00:04:15,739 --> 00:04:17,539
"Maggie." "Margaret."

132
00:04:17,607 --> 00:04:19,874
"Maggie" is fine.

133
00:04:19,943 --> 00:04:21,454
Dr. Yang will be
coming in later today

134
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:23,278
for a final checkup
with her conduit baby

135
00:04:23,347 --> 00:04:25,041
before she... And
then she's leaving?

136
00:04:25,065 --> 00:04:26,409
For good? Yes.

137
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:28,233
Yes, she will be gone
by the end of the day.

138
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:30,668
Is that it?

139
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:33,604
Yes. I have a patient in pre-op.

140
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:37,009
It's that way.

141
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:40,205
I'm getting it. Mmm-hmm.

142
00:04:42,249 --> 00:04:44,149
Chief, can I talk to
you? Mmm-hmm.

143
00:04:44,218 --> 00:04:45,795
You are. Privately?

144
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:48,064
Do you have a minute to
go into, like, a trauma room?

145
00:04:48,088 --> 00:04:51,022
Spit it out, Kepner.
I'm pregnant.

146
00:04:51,091 --> 00:04:52,802
I know it's sudden
and it's soon,

147
00:04:52,826 --> 00:04:54,320
and I know it
makes your life hell,

148
00:04:54,344 --> 00:04:55,921
but I will work until
it falls out of me.

149
00:04:55,945 --> 00:04:58,057
Kepners are built
to have babies, sir.

150
00:04:58,081 --> 00:04:59,898
We've dropped
them in fields. Kepner,

151
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,233
I'm happy for you.

152
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,350
I'm thrilled.

153
00:05:02,419 --> 00:05:04,264
Congratulations. Thank you.

154
00:05:04,288 --> 00:05:06,216
It was earlier than we thought,
but my mom always says

155
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,468
that if you wait for the
perfect time to have a baby,

156
00:05:08,492 --> 00:05:09,936
- then you'll just die...
<i>- If you're</i>

157
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,404
<i>just joining us...</i> childless.

158
00:05:11,428 --> 00:05:12,605
<i>We have breaking
news...</i> Turn that up.

159
00:05:12,629 --> 00:05:14,595
<i>Of an enormous explosion.</i>

160
00:05:14,664 --> 00:05:18,400
<i>It happened only minutes ago
at Seattle's Mall of the Woods.</i>

161
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:20,952
<i>We are getting reports
of massive fatalities.</i>

162
00:05:21,021 --> 00:05:23,282
Oh, my gosh! Explosion!
<i>And scores of people injured.</i>

163
00:05:23,306 --> 00:05:24,639
Oh, my gosh!

164
00:05:24,707 --> 00:05:25,985
<i>Officials have not
yet determined...</i>

165
00:05:26,009 --> 00:05:27,620
Page all available
surgeons. Clear the ER.

166
00:05:27,644 --> 00:05:29,121
Bring them to me. Discharge
all patients who can be.

167
00:05:29,145 --> 00:05:30,689
Cancel all elective surgeries.
Admits... Get them upstairs.

168
00:05:30,713 --> 00:05:32,091
I want a security
lockdown on this floor.

169
00:05:32,115 --> 00:05:33,592
I want all available beds
and gurneys down here.

170
00:05:33,616 --> 00:05:35,984
Call blood services. I want
all the O-neg they have.

171
00:05:36,052 --> 00:05:39,420
<i>The concern right now and
what we're all wondering is</i>

172
00:05:39,489 --> 00:05:42,023
<i>is this an act of terrorism?</i>

173
00:05:51,134 --> 00:05:52,628
So it's chemical?
I'm not saying that.

174
00:05:52,652 --> 00:05:55,620
Some patients are presenting
with blisters and rashes,

175
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:57,166
but the cause is not yet known.

176
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,267
This could be nothing,
but we are taking proper

177
00:05:58,291 --> 00:05:59,908
decontamination precautions.

178
00:05:59,977 --> 00:06:02,177
The main message
here is that we are

179
00:06:02,246 --> 00:06:04,366
fully equipped to
treat the injured.

180
00:06:04,414 --> 00:06:08,733
If you're coming to the hospital
to look for a loved one, if...

181
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:12,470
If you've... If you've
lost someone, then...

182
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:13,949
Please stay clear of
the emergency entrance.

183
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:15,267
Come straight to
the main entrance.

184
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:17,251
Thank you. MAN:
One more question!

185
00:06:19,813 --> 00:06:21,223
Chief Hunt? Hmm.

186
00:06:21,247 --> 00:06:23,058
Ray Pelletier,
Homeland Security.

187
00:06:23,082 --> 00:06:24,794
There are some patients
we need to talk to.

188
00:06:24,818 --> 00:06:26,350
Follow me.

189
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,963
Okay, take this one
to trauma four now.

190
00:06:27,987 --> 00:06:29,098
Kepner, how are we?

191
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:30,266
Good. We've taken
in over 30 injured.

192
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:31,523
More on the way.

193
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:33,503
Triage areas are laid out.
Reds here, yellows here,

194
00:06:33,527 --> 00:06:35,337
greens in the
hallway. And upstairs?

195
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:37,796
We've started rotating
ORs, one surgeon in each,

196
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:39,008
with steady turnover.

197
00:06:39,032 --> 00:06:40,064
Okay. Talk to these men.

198
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:41,677
Help them find who
they're looking for.

199
00:06:41,701 --> 00:06:43,568
And, Kepner, get a mask on.

200
00:06:43,637 --> 00:06:44,814
Oh, God. Yes, sir.
Thank you. Thank you.

201
00:06:44,838 --> 00:06:46,704
This way, guys.

202
00:06:56,049 --> 00:06:58,194
<i>Hi. You've reached the
phone of Dr. Cristina Yang.</i>

203
00:06:58,218 --> 00:06:59,218
<i>I'm...</i>

204
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:06,319
ORs one through
three are general.

205
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:07,420
We're gonna need more.

206
00:07:07,444 --> 00:07:09,405
Neuro's in four,
and cardio is in five.

207
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:10,623
Who's in the cardio OR?

208
00:07:10,647 --> 00:07:11,913
Pierce, the new cardio chief.

209
00:07:11,982 --> 00:07:13,080
Okay, you guys, uh,

210
00:07:13,149 --> 00:07:15,467
Kepner needs help
with triage downstairs.

211
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:16,780
Karev, you see
Yang this morning?

212
00:07:16,804 --> 00:07:18,219
No, wasn't she with you?

213
00:07:18,287 --> 00:07:21,039
Yeah, she said something
about going to the mall.

214
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:22,301
You got to be
freaking kidding me.

215
00:07:22,325 --> 00:07:23,224
We don't worry until we're sure

216
00:07:23,293 --> 00:07:24,637
we have something
to worry about,

217
00:07:24,661 --> 00:07:25,510
but if you see her,
you let me know, okay?

218
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:26,511
Don't tell Mer! Yeah.

219
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:27,778
Your airway looks good.

220
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:29,192
This cut will need
to be stitched up.

221
00:07:29,216 --> 00:07:30,899
And the blisters?

222
00:07:30,967 --> 00:07:32,712
What is this? We don't know yet,

223
00:07:32,736 --> 00:07:34,397
but we're running
some tests, okay?

224
00:07:34,421 --> 00:07:36,301
I can't find him. I looked
all over down here.

225
00:07:36,356 --> 00:07:37,433
I looked outside.
I can't find him.

226
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:38,723
Who?

227
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,007
Leo. My boy.

228
00:07:40,077 --> 00:07:41,887
Our little boy. He was with me.

229
00:07:41,911 --> 00:07:43,144
We were buying shoes when...

230
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:45,063
Marilyn, I'm gonna
give you some sedation.

231
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:47,449
Just try to breathe, okay?

232
00:07:48,335 --> 00:07:49,784
What does Leo look like?

233
00:07:49,852 --> 00:07:51,647
He's 10. Brown hair. It's long.

234
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:53,465
It's too long. He won't cut it.

235
00:07:53,489 --> 00:07:55,090
Brown eyes. He has braces.

236
00:07:55,175 --> 00:07:57,008
If he's here, we'll find him.

237
00:07:57,077 --> 00:07:58,621
So, you said you're 31
weeks pregnant, Leanne?

238
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:00,640
Uh-huh. Homestretch, huh?

239
00:08:00,664 --> 00:08:01,991
I'm actually
expecting a baby, too.

240
00:08:02,015 --> 00:08:03,258
Is the baby gonna be all right?

241
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:04,894
We have to do
surgery on your arm,

242
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:06,629
but if your baby
goes into any distress,

243
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:07,881
we'll need to do a
C-section, okay, Leanne?

244
00:08:07,905 --> 00:08:09,865
No, no, no, no, it's too
soon. She's too little.

245
00:08:09,922 --> 00:08:11,083
No, your baby's
gonna be just fine.

246
00:08:11,107 --> 00:08:12,902
It's not my baby. Sorry. What?

247
00:08:12,926 --> 00:08:15,226
It's someone else's
baby. I'm a surrogate.

248
00:08:15,295 --> 00:08:17,123
Can you please try
to let it get to term?

249
00:08:17,147 --> 00:08:18,207
It's their baby.

250
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:19,425
We will do what we can.

251
00:08:19,449 --> 00:08:20,810
And they're a super-nice couple,

252
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:21,944
and they trust me,
and it'll kill them,

253
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:23,351
and I really like them.

254
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,298
Leanne, we're gonna take care
of you now, okay? Don't worry.

255
00:08:25,322 --> 00:08:26,821
One, two, three!

256
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,057
Let's get her to the ICU.

257
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:30,591
Turn the room over. Let's go!

258
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:31,740
Right away, Doctor.

259
00:08:31,794 --> 00:08:33,294
Next!

260
00:08:33,363 --> 00:08:35,074
When did you get here? As
soon as I found out. You okay?

261
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:36,142
I'm fine. You
want to switch out?

262
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:37,343
No. You want to switch out?

263
00:08:37,367 --> 00:08:38,677
Derek, you want me to
take over your service,

264
00:08:38,701 --> 00:08:39,941
let me take over your service.

265
00:08:40,003 --> 00:08:41,447
Next patient,
please. A 26-year-old.

266
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:43,316
Left frontoparietal
subdural hematoma.

267
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:45,434
Burr hole's not gonna do this,
so what you're gonna need to do...

268
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:46,807
I'll see when I get in there.

269
00:08:48,962 --> 00:08:50,923
Make a path, people!
Coming through!

270
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:52,646
I got it.

271
00:08:52,715 --> 00:08:53,943
What are you doing here?

272
00:08:53,967 --> 00:08:55,283
Isn't it obvious?

273
00:08:55,352 --> 00:08:57,451
Actually, I came
to visit my son.

274
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,965
Apparently, I'm going
to be a grandmother.

275
00:08:58,989 --> 00:09:00,632
Webber, we need
to open another OR.

276
00:09:00,656 --> 00:09:01,834
Can you go up to six?

277
00:09:01,858 --> 00:09:02,790
I'll start throwing
patients at you.

278
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:03,996
Yeah. On my way.

279
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:08,963
It's a weekday, right?
Shouldn't you be in class?

280
00:09:09,032 --> 00:09:10,142
What were you doing at the mall?

281
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:11,544
Where's Nicky?
Where's my friend?

282
00:09:11,568 --> 00:09:13,162
Nicky's gone, Mike.
It's just me and you.

283
00:09:13,186 --> 00:09:14,402
Now, you want to talk to me?

284
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:16,988
What was in your
friend's backpack?

285
00:09:18,324 --> 00:09:19,824
Mike!

286
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:21,687
His eardrums are ruptured.
He may not be able to hear you.

287
00:09:21,711 --> 00:09:23,305
Okay, he's coming
with me. Get his clothes.

288
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:25,241
You can't take him anywhere.
We have to watch him.

289
00:09:25,265 --> 00:09:26,925
You said he isn't
badly injured, right?

290
00:09:26,949 --> 00:09:29,233
What I said was, so far, his
work-up has been negative,

291
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:31,102
but internal-blast
injuries take a while...

292
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:33,349
Okay, so, you're saying he
was likely very close to the blast.

293
00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:35,701
No, what I'm saying is... Right
next to it? Was he running...

294
00:09:35,725 --> 00:09:36,891
We need some help in here!

295
00:09:36,977 --> 00:09:38,857
You got it, Doctor. - He's okay.

296
00:09:39,112 --> 00:09:40,562
He's tachycardic.

297
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:42,925
Abdomen's rigid. We got to
get him to the OR. Right away.

298
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:44,426
Ma'am, we don't
know if this is over yet.

299
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:46,584
If he dies on your table
before I question him,

300
00:09:46,653 --> 00:09:48,214
- we have nothing left.
- And if he isn't the guy,

301
00:09:48,238 --> 00:09:49,465
you have a dead
civilian on your hands

302
00:09:49,489 --> 00:09:50,838
whose care you obstructed.

303
00:09:50,907 --> 00:09:52,084
Move! Ma'am, please!

304
00:09:52,108 --> 00:09:53,452
It's "Doctor." You're
the boss out there.

305
00:09:53,476 --> 00:09:55,836
I'm the boss in here.
Get out of my way.

306
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:58,163
Let's let 'em by.

307
00:10:00,233 --> 00:10:02,333
I need some help here! Now!

308
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:05,598
What happened? He
was walking and talking,

309
00:10:05,622 --> 00:10:06,955
and he just went down.

310
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:08,585
His airway is clear.
No breath sounds.

311
00:10:08,609 --> 00:10:09,974
I can't feel a pulse.

312
00:10:10,043 --> 00:10:11,571
Get a crash cart, chest
tube, and chest tray now.

313
00:10:11,595 --> 00:10:13,406
How long's he been
down? Almost a minute.

314
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:14,707
Crap. Has he been sprayed down?
- No, sir.

315
00:10:14,731 --> 00:10:16,891
Spray him down now! - I'm on it!

316
00:10:19,403 --> 00:10:20,713
Everywhere! Get him everywhere!

317
00:10:20,737 --> 00:10:21,737
That's it.

318
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:23,604
Hold it. Hold it. Stop.

319
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:25,857
Damn it.

320
00:10:25,909 --> 00:10:27,374
Damn it. I need that chest tray!

321
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:28,461
Get me a chest tray now!

322
00:10:28,528 --> 00:10:29,768
Got it. Here. Here.

323
00:10:30,847 --> 00:10:32,013
Oh, my God.

324
00:10:32,081 --> 00:10:33,397
Thank God you're here.

325
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:34,577
Of course I'm here.

326
00:10:34,601 --> 00:10:35,794
Hunt said you went to the mall.

327
00:10:35,818 --> 00:10:37,930
No, I didn't have time. I
was... What are we doing?

328
00:10:37,954 --> 00:10:39,932
Sudden loss of vitals with
penetrating injury to the chest.

329
00:10:39,956 --> 00:10:41,534
You're gonna have
to open him up.

330
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:44,678
Shouldn't you do it? No,
you're there. You got it. Go for it.

331
00:10:45,411 --> 00:10:47,291
Oh, my God. What?

332
00:10:47,997 --> 00:10:49,237
I was gonna go to the mall.

333
00:10:57,256 --> 00:10:59,891
<i>Diane, officials are seeking
to question these men</i>

334
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,961
<i>seen entering the mall minutes
before the explosion occurred.</i>

335
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:04,757
<i>Of course, the
biggest question is,</i>

336
00:11:04,781 --> 00:11:06,981
<i>"Could there be more
attacks on the way?"</i>

337
00:11:07,049 --> 00:11:09,517
<i>That's right. In fact, some
people are wondering</i>

338
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:11,631
<i>if this could be a
terrorist strategy</i>

339
00:11:11,655 --> 00:11:13,332
<i>to send victims to the hospital</i>

340
00:11:13,356 --> 00:11:15,167
<i>and then target
the hospital itself.</i>

341
00:11:15,191 --> 00:11:16,891
<i>Alana, should you even be there?</i>

342
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:18,738
<i>I know, right? It's an
intensely dangerous situation.</i>

343
00:11:18,762 --> 00:11:19,905
What did she just say?

344
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:21,629
Turn that TV off!

345
00:11:21,698 --> 00:11:23,409
No, no, I did work here,
like, two weeks ago.

346
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:24,543
No, she's okay. Let her through.

347
00:11:24,567 --> 00:11:25,933
What can I do?

348
00:11:26,002 --> 00:11:27,962
Yellows, reds, and
greens in the hallway.

349
00:11:28,004 --> 00:11:29,537
Assess and treat what you can.

350
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:31,049
Okay, but I don't
have privileges.

351
00:11:31,073 --> 00:11:32,985
I can't operate. Whatever
needs to be done, do it.

352
00:11:33,009 --> 00:11:35,087
And if you see a 10-year-old
boy with brown hair,

353
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:37,295
brown eyes, and
braces, come find me.

354
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:39,058
Let's go! Let's go! Let's
go! MAN: Coming through!

355
00:11:39,082 --> 00:11:40,414
Next! Him?

356
00:11:40,484 --> 00:11:42,884
He's got peritonitis, probably
from a perf in the bowel.

357
00:11:42,953 --> 00:11:44,786
Head CT shows a probable TBI.

358
00:11:44,855 --> 00:11:46,354
I called neuro for a consult.

359
00:11:46,422 --> 00:11:47,856
Okay.

360
00:11:47,924 --> 00:11:50,257
Okay, oh, Bailey, DHS
wants to speak with him.

361
00:11:50,326 --> 00:11:51,693
He's a possible suspect.

362
00:11:51,761 --> 00:11:53,828
So, you page me when you finish.

363
00:11:53,897 --> 00:11:54,897
Got it.

364
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:59,350
Transradial amputation.

365
00:11:59,419 --> 00:12:01,318
Below the elbow, at least.

366
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:03,298
Why would they hit a shopping
mall? There's nothing there.

367
00:12:03,322 --> 00:12:04,834
Except people. Regular people.

368
00:12:04,858 --> 00:12:06,301
They want to scare us.

369
00:12:06,325 --> 00:12:07,870
It's the scariest
thing we can think of.

370
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:09,505
Has that rash shown up
on any of our doctors yet?

371
00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:10,673
Not yet, which is good.

372
00:12:10,697 --> 00:12:12,708
It means it might
not be airborne.

373
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:13,976
The news said they might
be targeting hospitals now.

374
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,511
Oh, Edwards, shut
your mouth, please.

375
00:12:15,535 --> 00:12:17,101
I'm just saying.

376
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:18,820
Whoa. Oh!

377
00:12:18,889 --> 00:12:20,754
Oh, did her water just break?

378
00:12:22,092 --> 00:12:23,157
The baby's in distress.

379
00:12:23,226 --> 00:12:24,403
Late decels on the
fetal heart monitor.

380
00:12:24,427 --> 00:12:25,838
We need OB down here, stat!

381
00:12:25,862 --> 00:12:27,356
And page Dr. Robbins.
Tell her we might be

382
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:28,940
delivering a premie in here.
- On it.

383
00:12:28,964 --> 00:12:30,776
What are you doing here? I
thought you had a big meeting.

384
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,744
They blew up Seattle,
Mer. I can't leave.

385
00:12:32,768 --> 00:12:35,336
You should. No one has
a beef with Switzerland.

386
00:12:35,405 --> 00:12:37,271
So, we're going to DC.

387
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,307
Um, we sign papers on
the townhouse tonight.

388
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:41,550
It's nice. It's gonna be good.

389
00:12:43,914 --> 00:12:46,014
What are you doing?

390
00:12:46,082 --> 00:12:48,327
I'm happy for you.
People do this.

391
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:49,483
Are you? Happy for me?

392
00:12:49,553 --> 00:12:50,793
I got to go to the OR.

393
00:12:50,854 --> 00:12:52,934
Alex gave a kid an
emergency thoracotomy.

394
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:56,290
Watch my finger.

395
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:58,025
I can't see out
of it. Is it gone?

396
00:12:58,094 --> 00:13:00,527
No, no, it's definitely there.

397
00:13:00,596 --> 00:13:01,924
It's orbital compartment
syndrome. Glove me.

398
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:03,647
Hey. Are you okay?

399
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,820
You have a little blood behind
your eye, and I'm gonna release that.

400
00:13:07,554 --> 00:13:08,754
This is gonna sting a little.

401
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:16,810
Okay.

402
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:17,999
Now look at his finger.

403
00:13:18,365 --> 00:13:19,365
Okay.

404
00:13:24,036 --> 00:13:25,553
Okay.

405
00:13:28,108 --> 00:13:29,156
Now open for me.

406
00:13:33,713 --> 00:13:34,979
I'm starting to see something.

407
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:39,584
I can see.

408
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:40,801
Thank you!

409
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:42,381
Thank you so much. You got it.

410
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:43,871
Ross! I need you in the OR!

411
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:53,564
Hey! Does that kid have braces?

412
00:13:53,633 --> 00:13:56,512
Hey, hey, listen. Yang, I
just got a call from UNOS.

413
00:13:56,536 --> 00:13:58,447
They've been trying to reach
you. Oh, my phone is dead.

414
00:13:58,471 --> 00:14:00,549
A heart's become available
that's a match for Link McNeil.

415
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:01,689
Now?

416
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:03,085
We tell them to do it
at Seattle Pres, right,

417
00:14:03,109 --> 00:14:04,587
because there's no...
No, no, no, send it here.

418
00:14:04,611 --> 00:14:07,051
No, I got to do it here.
Tell the McNeils to come.

419
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:23,355
<i>Center of the crisis at
Grey Sloan Memorial.</i>

420
00:14:23,379 --> 00:14:25,145
<i>Byron, what can you tell us?</i>

421
00:14:25,214 --> 00:14:27,495
<i>What have you
learned at the hospital?</i>

422
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:30,017
<i>Right, Diane,
there's concern now</i>

423
00:14:30,086 --> 00:14:32,215
<i>that the skin reactions on
patients we're hearing about</i>

424
00:14:32,239 --> 00:14:34,450
<i>could possibly be
caused by radiation</i>

425
00:14:34,474 --> 00:14:36,357
<i>from a so-called
dirty bomb.</i> Damn it.

426
00:14:36,426 --> 00:14:37,770
<i>And the fear is it might
not be as easily treatable</i>

427
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:39,126
<i>as an attack from chemicals...</i>

428
00:14:39,195 --> 00:14:40,060
<i>as we previously thought,</i>

429
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:41,329
<i>but the fact is...</i>

430
00:14:41,398 --> 00:14:42,841
<i>The fact is, you don't know.</i>

431
00:14:42,865 --> 00:14:44,365
<i>Oh, here's the Chief of Surgery.</i>

432
00:14:44,434 --> 00:14:46,167
<i>You are lying to them now.</i>

433
00:14:46,235 --> 00:14:48,336
<i>You are saying anthrax.
You are saying radiation.</i>

434
00:14:48,405 --> 00:14:49,671
<i>Nobody else is.</i>

435
00:14:49,739 --> 00:14:52,707
<i>The fact is we don't know
how bad this is, okay?</i>

436
00:14:52,776 --> 00:14:56,010
<i>So stop wondering out
loud, report what you know,</i>

437
00:14:56,078 --> 00:14:58,112
<i>and stop scaring
people for no reason.</i>

438
00:14:58,181 --> 00:15:00,080
<i>What... I mean,
who let you in here?</i>

439
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:02,616
<i>Get out. Stop.
Turn off the camera.</i>

440
00:15:02,685 --> 00:15:05,085
<i>Well, we seem to
have lost Byron there.</i>

441
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:07,187
<i>Tensions seem to
be running pretty high,</i>

442
00:15:07,256 --> 00:15:11,392
<i>as one would expect in
such a dangerous situation.</i>

443
00:15:11,461 --> 00:15:13,627
<i>Stay with us for
complete coverage.</i>

444
00:15:13,696 --> 00:15:14,896
<i>We will be right back.</i>

445
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:19,494
I'm ready. Where's the OB?

446
00:15:19,518 --> 00:15:21,296
No show, but I
prepped her for them.

447
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,497
Decels are really frequent.

448
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:23,933
You need to get that
baby out of there now.

449
00:15:23,957 --> 00:15:25,000
Well, where the hell's the OB?

450
00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:26,602
The baby's down to
60 beats per minute.

451
00:15:26,626 --> 00:15:28,270
All right, Avery,
you're gonna help me.

452
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:29,143
Fifty beats and sustained.
- I need a 10 blade.

453
00:15:29,212 --> 00:15:30,406
Okay, hang on, sweetie.

454
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:31,670
Let's get you out of there.

455
00:15:32,365 --> 00:15:33,764
She'll want a stapler.

456
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:36,114
We've isolated
the hilum. Stapler.

457
00:15:38,038 --> 00:15:39,878
How are you gonna cope with it?

458
00:15:40,407 --> 00:15:41,572
With what?

459
00:15:41,641 --> 00:15:43,007
The boredom.

460
00:15:43,076 --> 00:15:45,643
Making buttholes will
be your whole career.

461
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:48,612
How will you not stick
your head in the oven?

462
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:51,182
Screw you. I'll cry
about it on my boat.

463
00:15:51,251 --> 00:15:52,811
Get a reload ready.
- Yeah, right.

464
00:15:52,835 --> 00:15:54,368
You just saw a kid,

465
00:15:54,437 --> 00:15:56,332
knew he had a hemothorax,
reached in, and fixed it.

466
00:15:56,356 --> 00:15:58,067
You know, you're never
gonna do that again.

467
00:15:58,091 --> 00:15:59,852
Saving kids with Ping-Pong balls

468
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:03,393
or making an end stoma
with an appendix. Stapler.

469
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:05,630
How did you even
know I did that?

470
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:07,276
You think I wasn't
paying attention

471
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,966
to you proving me wrong?

472
00:16:09,035 --> 00:16:10,229
I mean, I thought
you were competent...

473
00:16:10,253 --> 00:16:11,619
Well, no.

474
00:16:11,688 --> 00:16:12,832
When you got here, I
thought you were an imbecile,

475
00:16:12,856 --> 00:16:15,656
but you got competent,
like a decent handyman.

476
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:19,326
But eventually, I had to
accept that you were good.

477
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:22,513
Good hands, and you
think fast, act faster.

478
00:16:22,581 --> 00:16:24,293
I mean, you'll never
be as good as me,

479
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:27,285
but you're very, very good.

480
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:29,264
Okay, let's get
ready for the leak test.

481
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:32,005
Irrigation? Thank you, Shane.

482
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:34,374
And you're putting all
that talent in a drawer.

483
00:16:34,444 --> 00:16:36,060
So maybe you are an imbecile.

484
00:16:36,129 --> 00:16:38,169
Oh, God, what a
relief. I'm still right.

485
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:41,293
Dr. Yang, did you schedule

486
00:16:41,317 --> 00:16:43,767
a pediatric heart transplant
to come here today?

487
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,614
Oh, hey, yes. Good.
Are the McNeils here?

488
00:16:45,638 --> 00:16:47,199
Why? Why would you
think that we could do...

489
00:16:47,223 --> 00:16:48,784
Don't worry about it.
He's not your problem.

490
00:16:48,808 --> 00:16:49,952
It is my department,
and I'll decide

491
00:16:49,976 --> 00:16:51,220
what should be
sent out to other...

492
00:16:51,244 --> 00:16:52,921
I'm a little busy
here, so can you just

493
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:55,385
tell me where I can
do the transplant?

494
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,729
I've just finished in OR three.

495
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:01,897
You can do your transplant in there.
- Great!

496
00:17:01,921 --> 00:17:03,904
Can you see if Link
McNeil is here yet

497
00:17:03,973 --> 00:17:05,813
and prep him for me? Thank you.

498
00:17:08,294 --> 00:17:09,877
I'm gonna miss you.

499
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:12,914
Seriously, though.
Link McNeil. Today?

500
00:17:12,982 --> 00:17:14,822
I just need something
to feel finished.

501
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:17,051
Shane can close for me.

502
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,263
Are you sure you want
him to close this kid?

503
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:19,832
I taught Shane how to close.

504
00:17:19,856 --> 00:17:22,139
There won't even be a
scar, will there, Shane?

505
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,448
Nope. Mmm-mmm.

506
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,527
Suction.

507
00:17:26,596 --> 00:17:28,474
Avery, I'm cutting the uterus,
so pull up on those clamps.

508
00:17:28,498 --> 00:17:29,498
Got it.

509
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:32,170
Okay, now reach in here

510
00:17:32,201 --> 00:17:34,602
and pull away from me.

511
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:36,370
You got to... You
got to pull harder.

512
00:17:36,439 --> 00:17:37,655
Tug it, Avery!

513
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,340
Okay, yeah. There. There.

514
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:40,469
Ooh, ooh. Okay.

515
00:17:40,493 --> 00:17:41,658
All right, I got it.

516
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,160
Clamp and cut the cord.

517
00:17:45,414 --> 00:17:47,894
Okay. ARIZONA:
All right, you got her.

518
00:17:48,117 --> 00:17:49,567
Okay. You're okay.

519
00:17:49,636 --> 00:17:51,852
Okay. All right.

520
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:55,823
You're okay.

521
00:17:56,392 --> 00:17:57,558
I got you.

522
00:17:58,561 --> 00:17:59,561
I got you.

523
00:18:05,068 --> 00:18:06,366
How long till we can have him?

524
00:18:06,435 --> 00:18:08,163
I have to get him to recovery
to make sure he's okay.

525
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:09,667
Doctor, I don't
think you understand

526
00:18:09,706 --> 00:18:11,166
the nature of what's
happening here!

527
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:13,471
Do you want him healthy
enough to answer your questions?

528
00:18:13,526 --> 00:18:14,625
Yeah.

529
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:18,178
Right.

530
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:22,083
Thank you for your time.

531
00:18:22,151 --> 00:18:23,634
Wait. What just happened?

532
00:18:23,703 --> 00:18:25,514
Situation's changed. He's
no longer a subject of interest.

533
00:18:25,538 --> 00:18:27,382
That's all I can tell you.
But what about him?

534
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:29,317
Don't you think you
owe him an apology?

535
00:18:29,341 --> 00:18:31,826
Doctor, you have a very
tough job keeping people alive.

536
00:18:33,296 --> 00:18:34,662
I do, too.

537
00:18:38,567 --> 00:18:40,245
Dry-cleaning fluid?
The CDC report says

538
00:18:40,269 --> 00:18:41,880
that's what's causing
the patients' blisters.

539
00:18:41,904 --> 00:18:43,687
There was a big dry
cleaner at the mall.

540
00:18:43,756 --> 00:18:45,417
Victims were laying
in puddles of the stuff.

541
00:18:45,441 --> 00:18:47,475
Prolonged skin exposure
can cause rashes.

542
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:49,871
So it wasn't a chemical
attack? It was just a bomb?

543
00:18:49,895 --> 00:18:51,440
Dr. Hunt, you'll
want to see this.

544
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:53,409
<i>And we will be bringing
you more information</i>

545
00:18:53,433 --> 00:18:55,116
<i>as it becomes available.</i>

546
00:18:55,184 --> 00:18:58,819
<i>We repeat now, investigators
have determined at this hour</i>

547
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:00,888
<i>that the Mall of the Woods blast</i>

548
00:19:00,957 --> 00:19:03,140
<i>was caused by a
gas-main explosion.</i>

549
00:19:03,209 --> 00:19:05,776
<i>Officials say they found
no evidence of foul play</i>

550
00:19:05,845 --> 00:19:09,313
<i>and that fears of a terrorist
threat were unfounded.</i>

551
00:19:09,381 --> 00:19:10,492
Thank you, Jesus.

552
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:11,782
<i>Seattle Power officials say...</i>

553
00:19:11,851 --> 00:19:12,783
Yep. Second that. <i>The
gas main ran directly</i>

554
00:19:12,852 --> 00:19:13,896
<i>under the mall's east end.</i>

555
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:14,980
All right, Chief, what's next?

556
00:19:15,004 --> 00:19:16,015
How does this change
what we're doing?

557
00:19:16,039 --> 00:19:17,371
It changes nothing, Kepner.

558
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,839
There was still an explosion.

559
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:20,685
The wounded are still
wounded, and people are still lost.

560
00:19:20,709 --> 00:19:22,943
Hey. I think I found
your brown-haired kid.

561
00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:24,339
Ross and Karev were
taking him into surgery,

562
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:26,241
and he's just on his
way out. Oh, thank God.

563
00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:27,809
I need to go tell
his parents. Go.

564
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,367
Dr. Hunt.

565
00:19:29,435 --> 00:19:31,213
Sabine, what are you doing here?

566
00:19:31,237 --> 00:19:32,920
They told us there's
a heart for Link.

567
00:19:32,989 --> 00:19:34,582
Today? They told
you to come here?

568
00:19:34,606 --> 00:19:36,740
I know, but Dr. Yang
told us to come right over.

569
00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:38,954
You spoke to her?
You spoke to Dr. Yang?

570
00:19:38,978 --> 00:19:40,018
Yes. She told us to come.

571
00:19:41,648 --> 00:19:43,014
Should we go somewhere else?

572
00:19:43,082 --> 00:19:44,426
I know that there's so many
people here that need help...

573
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:46,700
No, no, no, no.
Link is gonna be fine.

574
00:19:47,536 --> 00:19:48,714
Everyone's gonna be fine.

575
00:19:48,738 --> 00:19:50,348
Come with me. I'll
help you find her.

576
00:19:50,372 --> 00:19:53,073
Dr. Hunt! We
need you here, stat!

577
00:19:53,142 --> 00:19:55,137
They dug her out.
Coded twice in the field.

578
00:19:55,161 --> 00:19:56,694
Penetrating trauma
to the abdomen.

579
00:19:56,763 --> 00:19:57,873
Okay, we need
take her straight up.

580
00:19:57,897 --> 00:20:01,098
Let's call ahead,
and let's clear an OR.

581
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:02,678
Take Mrs. McNeil.
Help her find Dr. Yang.

582
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:03,746
And, Murphy?

583
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:05,319
Thank you for coming in.

584
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:08,506
He's still intubated.

585
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:10,014
He's had his left lung removed,

586
00:20:10,075 --> 00:20:11,795
but Dr. Yang says
he'll recover just fine.

587
00:20:18,835 --> 00:20:19,967
That's... That's not him.

588
00:20:23,122 --> 00:20:25,172
That's not our son.

589
00:20:33,015 --> 00:20:35,849
Four by fours.

590
00:20:36,819 --> 00:20:38,185
Four by fours.

591
00:20:38,254 --> 00:20:41,071
April, where do you
keep the four by fours?

592
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:43,140
Oh, hi. You're here. Hi.

593
00:20:44,043 --> 00:20:45,163
What's wrong?

594
00:20:46,345 --> 00:20:48,495
It was a shopping mall.

595
00:20:50,883 --> 00:20:53,250
Didn't you hear?
It wasn't terrorists.

596
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:54,634
But that's what we thought.

597
00:20:54,704 --> 00:20:56,937
We live in a world where that is

598
00:20:57,006 --> 00:20:59,456
the first thought that
crosses our minds.

599
00:20:59,525 --> 00:21:01,425
I don't think I can do it.

600
00:21:01,493 --> 00:21:03,243
I don't think I
can raise a child

601
00:21:03,312 --> 00:21:06,847
in a world where they could
die going to buy new shoes.

602
00:21:06,916 --> 00:21:09,027
I remember when
I was 10 years old,

603
00:21:09,051 --> 00:21:12,252
sitting in a restaurant with
my father, getting waffles.

604
00:21:12,988 --> 00:21:14,888
I loved waffles.

605
00:21:14,957 --> 00:21:17,157
I didn't like eggs. Still don't.

606
00:21:17,492 --> 00:21:19,510
This was 1960,

607
00:21:19,579 --> 00:21:21,011
in Texas, in a town so small

608
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,091
it probably has forgotten
its own name by now.

609
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:24,631
And I remember

610
00:21:24,701 --> 00:21:28,235
some ignorant young
men telling us to leave,

611
00:21:28,304 --> 00:21:30,671
dumping my father's
food in his lap,

612
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:32,923
throwing hot coffee on him.

613
00:21:32,991 --> 00:21:34,641
Was I scared? Yes.

614
00:21:34,711 --> 00:21:36,789
I begged him to
take me out of there.

615
00:21:36,813 --> 00:21:38,874
Do you know what
he said to me? What?

616
00:21:38,898 --> 00:21:42,032
"Not until after you finish
your eggs, young lady."

617
00:21:44,987 --> 00:21:47,304
What did they do? What happened?

618
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:49,356
Nothing.

619
00:21:49,425 --> 00:21:51,275
They went on to
bother somebody else.

620
00:21:52,595 --> 00:21:56,663
He wasn't afraid, so they
didn't have any power.

621
00:21:57,867 --> 00:22:00,250
April, there's always gonna be

622
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,985
stupid people.

623
00:22:02,054 --> 00:22:03,732
There's always
gonna be accidents.

624
00:22:03,756 --> 00:22:05,667
But that's not what defeats you.

625
00:22:05,691 --> 00:22:07,674
It's the fear.

626
00:22:07,744 --> 00:22:10,510
Now, if you had told
me on that day in 1960

627
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:12,740
that I would have the
job that I have today,

628
00:22:12,764 --> 00:22:14,031
the child that I have,

629
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,577
I would have
laughed till I cried.

630
00:22:15,601 --> 00:22:18,535
It seemed beyond impossible.

631
00:22:18,604 --> 00:22:23,107
But this is the way the
world changes, sweetheart.

632
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:26,576
Good people raising
their babies right.

633
00:22:29,965 --> 00:22:31,776
Now, come on. Where
are the four by fours?

634
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,212
We got things to do. Okay.

635
00:22:33,236 --> 00:22:34,785
We got work to do!

636
00:22:37,706 --> 00:22:38,972
Did more come in?

637
00:22:39,041 --> 00:22:40,685
No, it's slowing down.
What are you still doing here?

638
00:22:40,709 --> 00:22:42,075
What time is your flight?

639
00:22:42,144 --> 00:22:43,772
I can't leave, Meredith.
They just bombed Seattle.

640
00:22:43,796 --> 00:22:45,345
No, they didn't. No one did.

641
00:22:45,414 --> 00:22:47,214
It was an accident. Gas main.

642
00:22:47,283 --> 00:22:48,894
So, no different than
a train derailment

643
00:22:48,918 --> 00:22:50,551
or a ferry-boat
crash, so you can go.

644
00:22:53,055 --> 00:22:56,624
When I heard it was the mall,
you know what I thought of?

645
00:22:56,692 --> 00:22:59,054
I thought about the time that
Callie and I played hookey

646
00:22:59,078 --> 00:23:01,023
and we bought all the
furniture for the firehouse.

647
00:23:01,047 --> 00:23:02,206
What time is your plane?

648
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:04,164
Two hours.

649
00:23:04,232 --> 00:23:05,777
But Link McNeil has got a
heart, and I have to do that first.

650
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:07,451
No, the new head
of cardio can do that.

651
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,919
You don't have the time.

652
00:23:10,489 --> 00:23:11,633
Plus, you'll have to re-scrub.

653
00:23:11,657 --> 00:23:13,068
What... So there's that.

654
00:23:13,092 --> 00:23:14,303
Meredith!

655
00:23:14,327 --> 00:23:15,454
You have been
stalling for two weeks.

656
00:23:15,478 --> 00:23:16,877
You know what? I have to...

657
00:23:16,946 --> 00:23:19,596
I have to finish something here.

658
00:23:19,665 --> 00:23:22,599
Nothing feels finished.
None of it feels finished.

659
00:23:23,335 --> 00:23:24,802
Owen and I...

660
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:31,509
We split over something
that hasn't even happened.

661
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:33,277
And we never even split up.

662
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:35,914
And...

663
00:23:38,618 --> 00:23:40,938
And you and I are not finished.

664
00:23:43,472 --> 00:23:45,467
George is dead,
and Izzie is gone,

665
00:23:45,491 --> 00:23:48,858
and it is supposed to
be you and me and Alex.

666
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:51,345
And now nothing is finished.

667
00:23:52,348 --> 00:23:53,491
I am not finished.

668
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:55,049
You don't feel finished

669
00:23:55,117 --> 00:23:56,850
because this isn't
the end for you.

670
00:23:57,786 --> 00:23:59,869
There is no finish line.

671
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:01,138
There is no end point.

672
00:24:02,874 --> 00:24:04,720
You just have to
go. I know. I know.

673
00:24:04,744 --> 00:24:08,112
I know, and I'm...
And I keep trying to,

674
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:10,630
but I don't know
how to just do it.

675
00:24:13,085 --> 00:24:14,985
You got to help me, Mer.

676
00:24:15,054 --> 00:24:17,404
Dr. Yang, the donor
heart was delayed in traffic.

677
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:19,090
How long? Can't say.

678
00:24:21,027 --> 00:24:22,159
Let's go.

679
00:24:26,682 --> 00:24:28,082
Okay? Okay.

680
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:35,005
Derek.

681
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:38,610
Goodbye.

682
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:42,395
Goodbye.

683
00:24:58,831 --> 00:25:00,008
Any more come in?

684
00:25:00,032 --> 00:25:01,097
Not for a while.

685
00:25:02,568 --> 00:25:04,201
It's not fair.

686
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:05,514
Webber was wrong.
Maybe you just need to...

687
00:25:05,538 --> 00:25:07,270
Really, Shane?

688
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:09,340
I hung on his
every word all year.

689
00:25:09,408 --> 00:25:10,791
All of us did.

690
00:25:10,859 --> 00:25:12,893
He's the greatest
teacher I have ever had,

691
00:25:12,962 --> 00:25:14,773
so maybe if it were
someone else saying this,

692
00:25:14,797 --> 00:25:16,680
I wouldn't believe
them, but Webber?

693
00:25:16,748 --> 00:25:18,315
I got to find what I'm good at.

694
00:25:19,719 --> 00:25:21,084
And I will.

695
00:25:22,571 --> 00:25:25,238
You will. Good luck.

696
00:25:33,199 --> 00:25:35,148
Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey, everything's okay.

697
00:25:35,217 --> 00:25:36,327
What happened?

698
00:25:36,351 --> 00:25:38,335
There was an explosion.

699
00:25:38,404 --> 00:25:41,338
But it's over, and
you're fine, okay?

700
00:25:41,407 --> 00:25:42,639
You're gonna be just fine.

701
00:26:07,449 --> 00:26:08,726
The patient in
bed four is awake.

702
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:10,017
Thank you.

703
00:26:21,763 --> 00:26:23,175
I would have thought, you know,

704
00:26:23,199 --> 00:26:25,143
now that you're Minister
of Education or whatever

705
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:26,444
that you could tell
the stupid board...

706
00:26:26,468 --> 00:26:28,302
I don't control
the budget, Bailey.

707
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:30,804
Well, did you at least
fight for me to keep my lab?

708
00:26:30,873 --> 00:26:32,339
No, I did not.

709
00:26:32,408 --> 00:26:33,848
Now, when it came
time this morning

710
00:26:33,875 --> 00:26:35,359
to decide who
would staff the ORs,

711
00:26:35,428 --> 00:26:37,260
who had the
stamina and the talent

712
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:40,047
to run patient after
patient, it was a no-brainer.

713
00:26:40,115 --> 00:26:42,027
I mean, some people
belong behind a microscope,

714
00:26:42,051 --> 00:26:43,383
but you don't.

715
00:26:43,451 --> 00:26:45,018
You are a surgeon, Bailey.

716
00:26:45,087 --> 00:26:46,503
It is what I trained you to be.

717
00:26:46,572 --> 00:26:49,189
And anything else would
be a waste of your time.

718
00:26:49,258 --> 00:26:51,074
And before you continue
trashing the board,

719
00:26:51,143 --> 00:26:52,904
you ought to know that
Yang is leaving a seat open,

720
00:26:52,928 --> 00:26:54,127
and I'm recommending you,

721
00:26:54,196 --> 00:26:56,063
which the board
will agree is also

722
00:26:56,131 --> 00:26:57,531
a no-brainer.

723
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:01,035
Oh.

724
00:27:01,837 --> 00:27:03,654
Well, that's...

725
00:27:03,706 --> 00:27:05,449
Dr. Bailey, Dr. Webber,
I just wanted to...

726
00:27:05,473 --> 00:27:07,535
She doesn't have
time for long goodbyes.

727
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:08,604
She has a plane
to catch. No, Mer...

728
00:27:08,628 --> 00:27:09,927
Well, you should go, then.

729
00:27:09,996 --> 00:27:11,522
Yeah, don't stand
around here talking.

730
00:27:11,546 --> 00:27:13,458
Go, be a surgeon. That's
what we trained you for.

731
00:27:13,482 --> 00:27:14,893
Can I come with
you? Shane, not now.

732
00:27:14,917 --> 00:27:15,999
I'm not kidding.

733
00:27:16,068 --> 00:27:17,668
Take me to Switzerland.
I can help you.

734
00:27:17,703 --> 00:27:19,197
You're in the middle
of your residency.

735
00:27:19,221 --> 00:27:20,938
And my teacher is leaving,

736
00:27:21,006 --> 00:27:24,458
the one I want to learn from to go
do the work I want to be a part of.

737
00:27:24,526 --> 00:27:27,761
I want to be in charge of my
education, and I choose you.

738
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:29,096
You can say no,

739
00:27:29,165 --> 00:27:31,281
but I will badger
you until you say yes.

740
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:36,770
Yes.

741
00:27:37,956 --> 00:27:39,890
I quit.

742
00:27:39,959 --> 00:27:42,993
Respectfully. And
thank you for everything.

743
00:27:44,029 --> 00:27:45,069
Really.

744
00:27:48,367 --> 00:27:49,616
Yes!

745
00:27:49,685 --> 00:27:51,646
Want to grab anything
else on the way out?

746
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:52,790
CT machine?

747
00:27:53,772 --> 00:27:55,021
What...

748
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:56,339
Thank you.

749
00:28:03,999 --> 00:28:05,182
Proud of you.

750
00:28:07,219 --> 00:28:08,463
Go. MEREDITH: Okay, now.

751
00:28:08,487 --> 00:28:10,264
Come on. Let's
go. We have to go.

752
00:28:10,288 --> 00:28:12,355
Wait. Wait. Wait here.

753
00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:14,258
Cristina, we got to go!

754
00:28:16,946 --> 00:28:18,689
Lap pads, more suction.

755
00:28:18,713 --> 00:28:19,913
Get in there, Warren.

756
00:28:19,981 --> 00:28:22,282
I know. Clamp it.

757
00:28:22,351 --> 00:28:23,617
And make it pretty later.

758
00:28:23,686 --> 00:28:24,996
Where's this
bleeding coming from?

759
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:26,020
Get underneath for me.

760
00:28:26,439 --> 00:28:27,439
Clamp.

761
00:28:55,217 --> 00:28:56,217
Good. Clamp.

762
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:07,461
Okay. That's good. Go ahead.

763
00:29:07,529 --> 00:29:09,830
Let's go. Now.
Or you never will.

764
00:29:09,898 --> 00:29:12,065
Wait. You already
called me a cab?

765
00:29:12,133 --> 00:29:13,383
No.

766
00:29:14,953 --> 00:29:16,753
Wait. Wait. Is that
for Link McNeil?

767
00:29:16,822 --> 00:29:18,121
Yeah. I need to find Dr. Yang.

768
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:19,372
I'm Dr. Yang.

769
00:29:19,441 --> 00:29:21,085
No! You need to find Dr. Pierce.

770
00:29:21,109 --> 00:29:22,738
You can go to the nurse's
station, and they will direct you.

771
00:29:22,762 --> 00:29:24,494
Meredith, no! I
can't just leave them.

772
00:29:24,563 --> 00:29:26,643
Yes, you can. They
are in good hands.

773
00:29:27,216 --> 00:29:28,565
Pierce is gonna do it,

774
00:29:28,633 --> 00:29:30,862
and Sabine knows she's
gonna do it. She consented.

775
00:29:30,886 --> 00:29:32,586
Owen is here, I am here,

776
00:29:32,655 --> 00:29:34,966
and we're gonna follow
up with Link post-op, okay?

777
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:36,484
Get to the airport
as fast as you can.

778
00:29:36,508 --> 00:29:38,775
Wait, Meredith. What?

779
00:29:38,844 --> 00:29:40,764
What do you need, an "I
love you" or something?

780
00:29:43,582 --> 00:29:45,015
I love you.

781
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:46,203
Call me when you get there.

782
00:30:13,579 --> 00:30:14,845
You okay?

783
00:30:15,881 --> 00:30:17,080
I just feel bad.

784
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:18,388
Did you lose someone?

785
00:30:19,835 --> 00:30:24,621
No, no, I didn't
lose a single one.

786
00:30:24,689 --> 00:30:28,558
That's why I feel bad,
'cause I feel so good.

787
00:30:28,627 --> 00:30:30,794
This is the thing, Meredith.

788
00:30:30,863 --> 00:30:32,295
This is what it feels like.

789
00:30:32,364 --> 00:30:33,942
It feels like... Candy.

790
00:30:33,966 --> 00:30:35,548
But with blood.

791
00:30:35,618 --> 00:30:39,086
Only so much better. And Derek,

792
00:30:39,154 --> 00:30:40,987
I mean, I was
still in his shadow,

793
00:30:41,056 --> 00:30:42,289
but I didn't even care.

794
00:30:42,357 --> 00:30:43,601
And the only thing that
would have made it better

795
00:30:43,625 --> 00:30:47,026
was if his shadow was
gone, so you guys can go.

796
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:49,479
Have fun. Be happy.

797
00:30:49,547 --> 00:30:50,787
What the heck?

798
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:52,729
Cristina, what are
you doing here?

799
00:30:54,653 --> 00:30:55,719
I can't go.

800
00:30:55,787 --> 00:30:56,998
Yes, you can!

801
00:30:57,022 --> 00:30:58,305
We have to finish.

802
00:30:58,373 --> 00:30:59,801
You're gonna miss your...
We have to dance it out.

803
00:30:59,825 --> 00:31:01,140
That's how we finish.

804
00:31:05,847 --> 00:31:07,197
What are you doing?

805
00:31:07,266 --> 00:31:09,816
What, you gonna call someone
to make me leave or what...

806
00:31:11,386 --> 00:31:12,506
I'm finding a song.

807
00:31:21,446 --> 00:31:23,166
Okay, ready? Wait.

808
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,277
We'll call each other
at least twice a month,

809
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:27,700
and we'll text all the time.

810
00:31:27,769 --> 00:31:29,329
You hate texting. Text me.

811
00:31:29,371 --> 00:31:31,182
And don't let Owen get all dark
and twisty. Take care of him.

812
00:31:31,206 --> 00:31:33,072
And Alex. Take care of Alex.

813
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:34,941
He needs to be mocked
at least once a day,

814
00:31:35,009 --> 00:31:37,127
or he'll be insufferable.

815
00:31:37,196 --> 00:31:40,213
Don't get on any little,
tiny planes that can crash

816
00:31:40,282 --> 00:31:43,683
or stick your hand in a body
cavity that has a bomb in it

817
00:31:43,752 --> 00:31:45,668
or offer your life to a gunman!

818
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:47,203
Don't do that.

819
00:31:49,575 --> 00:31:50,974
Don't be a hero.

820
00:31:52,811 --> 00:31:54,478
You're my person.

821
00:31:55,213 --> 00:31:56,413
I need you alive.

822
00:31:56,982 --> 00:31:58,181
You make me brave.

823
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,320
Okay.

824
00:32:04,489 --> 00:32:05,588
Now we dance it out.

825
00:32:26,795 --> 00:32:28,261
You love this song!

826
00:33:19,898 --> 00:33:21,047
I got to go.

827
00:33:22,701 --> 00:33:24,284
You stay here, okay?

828
00:33:24,352 --> 00:33:25,369
Okay.

829
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:35,695
You are a gifted surgeon
with an extraordinary mind.

830
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:39,866
Don't let what he wants
eclipse what you need.

831
00:33:39,935 --> 00:33:43,387
He's very dreamy.
But he is not the sun.

832
00:33:44,139 --> 00:33:45,371
You are.

833
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:58,368
They're asleep.

834
00:33:58,436 --> 00:34:00,070
Did you get those signed?

835
00:34:01,639 --> 00:34:03,439
Meredith, you'll
talk to her tomorrow.

836
00:34:03,508 --> 00:34:05,789
Knowing you guys,
you'll talk every day.

837
00:34:08,363 --> 00:34:09,895
No, it's not...

838
00:34:10,915 --> 00:34:12,155
I don't think I can sign this.

839
00:34:12,183 --> 00:34:13,617
Sorry, I know you're wiped,

840
00:34:13,685 --> 00:34:15,112
but I need to have those
on the plane by 7:00.

841
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:16,336
No, I don't...

842
00:34:18,206 --> 00:34:19,556
I think I need to stay here.

843
00:34:28,016 --> 00:34:29,916
Dr. Torres?

844
00:34:29,985 --> 00:34:31,517
Um, the baby's parents are here,

845
00:34:31,586 --> 00:34:33,031
and they were wondering
if Leanne was up to...

846
00:34:33,055 --> 00:34:34,204
Yes, yes. Please, yes.

847
00:34:34,272 --> 00:34:35,671
Yeah? Okay. Yeah, come in.

848
00:34:39,294 --> 00:34:41,127
Hey, Leanne.

849
00:34:41,196 --> 00:34:42,328
Are you okay?

850
00:34:42,397 --> 00:34:43,630
Is she okay?

851
00:34:43,698 --> 00:34:45,259
Do you guys love
her? Is she all right?

852
00:34:45,283 --> 00:34:47,551
She's beautiful. She's perfect.

853
00:34:47,619 --> 00:34:49,101
Thank you.

854
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:50,410
We're so glad you're okay.

855
00:34:54,793 --> 00:34:55,892
Are you okay?

856
00:34:55,961 --> 00:34:58,528
Yeah. That's just...
It's really sweet.

857
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:00,430
Yeah.

858
00:35:00,498 --> 00:35:02,665
It's really amazing.

859
00:35:02,734 --> 00:35:04,618
I wonder why they
wanted a surrogate.

860
00:35:04,686 --> 00:35:07,420
I wonder if... I wonder
if she couldn't...

861
00:35:07,489 --> 00:35:08,988
She really helped them.

862
00:35:09,057 --> 00:35:10,673
She really likes them.

863
00:35:10,742 --> 00:35:12,275
That's really amazing, right?

864
00:35:30,662 --> 00:35:33,613
Guess what. I
delivered a baby today.

865
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:35,615
And the good news is,

866
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,700
if the OB doesn't show
up for ours, then I get...

867
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:39,335
Hey.

868
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:43,640
Our baby will be fine.

869
00:35:43,709 --> 00:35:47,978
He'll be fine, or she will
be 'cause she'll have us.

870
00:35:48,046 --> 00:35:50,480
Hey, of course she will.

871
00:35:50,549 --> 00:35:53,817
You know, my mom always
says that's how the world changes.

872
00:35:53,886 --> 00:35:56,119
Good people raising
their babies right.

873
00:35:56,187 --> 00:35:57,899
Wait, is that...
Is that a thing?

874
00:35:57,923 --> 00:36:00,163
I thought that was just my mom.

875
00:36:06,982 --> 00:36:08,214
I love you.

876
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:14,103
It went perfectly.

877
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:17,132
Link's heart is responding
well, and so is he.

878
00:36:17,809 --> 00:36:19,943
Thank you. Thank you so much.

879
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:21,188
My pleasure.

880
00:36:21,212 --> 00:36:22,579
Now, I know from Dr. Yang

881
00:36:22,648 --> 00:36:25,081
that you've heard the whole
anti-rejection spiel before...

882
00:36:36,995 --> 00:36:40,263
I don't want to get too excited.

883
00:36:40,331 --> 00:36:42,665
Yang's body isn't
even cold yet, but...

884
00:36:42,734 --> 00:36:44,534
No, you can...
You can be excited.

885
00:36:44,603 --> 00:36:46,636
You got a place on the board!

886
00:36:47,672 --> 00:36:51,207
I will make policy,
not just hear it.

887
00:36:51,276 --> 00:36:53,075
I will make changes.

888
00:36:53,128 --> 00:36:54,727
You can keep your genome lab.

889
00:36:54,796 --> 00:36:56,457
We can have a genome theme park.

890
00:36:56,481 --> 00:36:58,161
And...

891
00:36:59,317 --> 00:37:00,557
It's just...

892
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:03,420
What?

893
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:07,106
Webber picked me.

894
00:37:11,346 --> 00:37:12,378
Ugh.

895
00:37:12,447 --> 00:37:13,758
Boy, get in there
deep, deep, deep.

896
00:37:13,782 --> 00:37:15,062
Oh, yeah, I got you. I got you.

897
00:37:17,519 --> 00:37:19,719
Ow! What is this?

898
00:37:20,455 --> 00:37:21,654
What is...

899
00:37:21,723 --> 00:37:23,156
It's from Yang.

900
00:37:32,016 --> 00:37:33,233
Alex, what?

901
00:37:33,301 --> 00:37:35,461
It's Cristina's shares
in the hospital.

902
00:37:36,621 --> 00:37:37,861
She's leaving them to me.

903
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:40,123
What?

904
00:37:40,192 --> 00:37:41,719
She left me her seat on
the board. Can she do that?

905
00:37:41,743 --> 00:37:43,209
I don't know.

906
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:45,411
She did.

907
00:37:54,405 --> 00:37:55,638
I took the job!

908
00:37:55,707 --> 00:37:57,552
And you were supposed
to be stepping back.

909
00:37:57,576 --> 00:37:59,487
You said, "Take this
year and make it count.

910
00:37:59,511 --> 00:38:01,622
"And I'll make sure you
can do it." And you lied!

911
00:38:01,646 --> 00:38:03,112
Sorry. I lied.

912
00:38:03,181 --> 00:38:05,247
It's a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity.

913
00:38:05,316 --> 00:38:07,094
So, you got this thing,
and I gave up that piece.

914
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:08,495
And I found a way
to make it work

915
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:11,087
with my job, my
kids, and my research

916
00:38:11,156 --> 00:38:13,234
with less help from you, and
I did it. You're not a victim.

917
00:38:13,258 --> 00:38:14,702
I'm killing myself just
as much as you are.

918
00:38:14,726 --> 00:38:16,554
And then you wanted more
pieces. I'm flying back and forth...

919
00:38:16,578 --> 00:38:18,339
And more pieces...
twice a week...

920
00:38:18,363 --> 00:38:20,040
You can't just drag
us away so I can come

921
00:38:20,064 --> 00:38:21,509
live in your shadow. "Shadow"?

922
00:38:21,533 --> 00:38:22,799
You have a job.

923
00:38:22,868 --> 00:38:24,395
You're gonna be working
at James Madison.

924
00:38:24,419 --> 00:38:26,480
Right, that's how my
father got his first job here.

925
00:38:26,504 --> 00:38:28,170
They wanted my mom,

926
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:31,018
so she had to call the
university and pull some strings

927
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:33,253
and find something
for Thatcher to do.

928
00:38:33,277 --> 00:38:34,727
It's called a trailing spouse.

929
00:38:34,796 --> 00:38:36,096
This is not like that.

930
00:38:36,181 --> 00:38:37,647
This is exactly that.

931
00:38:37,716 --> 00:38:39,393
And it's not what
I signed up for.

932
00:38:39,417 --> 00:38:40,761
You know what?
You're being selfish.

933
00:38:40,785 --> 00:38:43,002
Well, I have to be, Derek,
because you believe

934
00:38:43,071 --> 00:38:44,915
that your career is more
important than mine.

935
00:38:44,939 --> 00:38:46,773
At this moment in time, it is!

936
00:38:46,858 --> 00:38:48,792
No, not at this moment. Always.

937
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:51,055
You will always be
that hotshot surgeon,

938
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:53,290
and I will always be that young
intern who fell in love with you.

939
00:38:53,314 --> 00:38:55,081
If that's how you see yourself,

940
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:56,694
that's your problem. I
can't do anything about that.

941
00:38:56,718 --> 00:38:58,958
That is not how I see
myself. That is the issue here.

942
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:04,156
DC. You can do your surgeries,

943
00:39:04,225 --> 00:39:06,593
you can do your research,
you can do the portal veins.

944
00:39:06,661 --> 00:39:08,573
There is nothing you can do
here that you can't do there.

945
00:39:08,597 --> 00:39:10,930
But I don't want to!

946
00:39:10,999 --> 00:39:12,710
We're not just talking
about my job, Derek.

947
00:39:12,734 --> 00:39:13,974
We're talking about my life.

948
00:39:14,019 --> 00:39:16,686
I grew up here. I
made my family here.

949
00:39:16,755 --> 00:39:18,165
I helped to rebuild
the hospital here

950
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:19,617
that has my sister's name on it,

951
00:39:19,641 --> 00:39:21,741
my mother's name, my name.

952
00:39:21,809 --> 00:39:23,960
I live here. My life is here.

953
00:39:24,029 --> 00:39:26,112
I don't want to leave.

954
00:39:26,181 --> 00:39:28,481
<i>Whenever we think
we know the future,</i>

955
00:39:31,419 --> 00:39:32,885
<i>even for a second,</i>

956
00:39:34,523 --> 00:39:36,322
<i>it changes.</i>

957
00:39:36,391 --> 00:39:39,159
Dr. Pierce, rough day, huh?

958
00:39:40,395 --> 00:39:41,727
Seven traumas,

959
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:43,907
two of which had
right ventricular perfs,

960
00:39:43,931 --> 00:39:47,033
topped off with a
pediatric heart transplant.

961
00:39:48,503 --> 00:39:50,097
Other than that,
how you settling in?

962
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:55,357
It has been the weirdest
two weeks of my life.

963
00:39:56,561 --> 00:39:59,529
I don't know anyone.
No one knows me.

964
00:39:59,598 --> 00:40:02,432
I haven't had one conversation
that wasn't related to work.

965
00:40:05,003 --> 00:40:08,654
Well, you know me now.

966
00:40:09,241 --> 00:40:10,439
No.

967
00:40:10,508 --> 00:40:13,709
God, I sound like a
kid crying at camp.

968
00:40:13,779 --> 00:40:15,019
No, it's not... It's not that.

969
00:40:15,046 --> 00:40:17,296
It's something else.

970
00:40:20,135 --> 00:40:22,335
I was adopted.

971
00:40:22,404 --> 00:40:24,753
Two years ago, I
looked up my birth mom.

972
00:40:24,822 --> 00:40:26,822
I had to go to the
court for the records.

973
00:40:26,891 --> 00:40:30,626
She's dead now, so I
could only get her name.

974
00:40:30,695 --> 00:40:33,963
But she was amazing.

975
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,283
She was a surgeon here.

976
00:40:37,352 --> 00:40:39,672
Her name is all
over this hospital.

977
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:42,639
That's not why I took the job.

978
00:40:42,707 --> 00:40:44,385
I mean, it's a little
bit why I interviewed,

979
00:40:44,409 --> 00:40:47,310
but it's just so weird.

980
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:52,615
What was her name?

981
00:40:54,018 --> 00:40:55,034
Your birth mother.

982
00:40:56,254 --> 00:40:57,453
Ellis Grey.

983
00:40:58,490 --> 00:41:00,607
Did you know her?

984
00:41:00,675 --> 00:41:04,043
<i>Sometimes the future
changes quickly and completely.</i>

985
00:41:06,715 --> 00:41:10,149
<i>And we're left only with
the choice of what to do next.</i>

986
00:41:10,218 --> 00:41:12,538
<i>You're asking me to
choose between this job</i>

987
00:41:13,755 --> 00:41:15,121
and my family?

988
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:18,824
I am simply saying I
am not going anywhere.

989
00:41:19,527 --> 00:41:22,761
I am staying here.

990
00:41:22,830 --> 00:41:25,064
<i>We can choose
to be afraid of it.</i>

991
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,935
<i>To stand there, trembling.</i>

992
00:41:30,538 --> 00:41:31,904
<i>Not moving.</i>

993
00:41:41,816 --> 00:41:43,649
<i>Assuming the worst
that can happen.</i>

994
00:41:53,328 --> 00:41:55,127
<i>Or we step forward...</i>

995
00:41:56,297 --> 00:41:57,374
Yes?

996
00:41:57,398 --> 00:41:58,648
Dr. Yang?

997
00:41:59,483 --> 00:42:00,750
They're all ready for you.

998
00:42:00,819 --> 00:42:02,539
<i>Into the unknown...</i>

999
00:42:04,138 --> 00:42:05,555
Let's do it.

1000
00:42:13,915 --> 00:42:18,451
<i>And assume it will be brilliant.</i>
