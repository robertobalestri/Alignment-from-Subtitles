1
00:00:06,073 --> 00:00:07,953
<i>Do you know who you are?</i>

2
00:00:10,478 --> 00:00:12,944
<i>Do you know what's
happened to you?</i>

3
00:00:17,084 --> 00:00:19,718
<i>Do you want to live this way?</i>

4
00:00:22,139 --> 00:00:23,566
There's a hole in
the pericardium.

5
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:24,951
That's the source
of all this blood?

6
00:00:24,975 --> 00:00:27,509
No, that's what's
keeping him alive.

7
00:00:31,499 --> 00:00:32,848
Well, hello.

8
00:00:32,917 --> 00:00:37,219
<i>All it takes is one person,
one patient, one moment,</i>

9
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:38,670
<i>to change your life forever.</i>

10
00:00:38,738 --> 00:00:41,690
Ross, I would like
to introduce you to

11
00:00:41,758 --> 00:00:43,508
the black mamba.

12
00:00:43,577 --> 00:00:46,895
<i>It can change your
perspective, color your thinking...</i>

13
00:00:46,964 --> 00:00:49,131
Isn't that the IVC?

14
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,467
The single trickiest vessel
in the entire human body.

15
00:00:52,536 --> 00:00:53,902
Delicate, unpredictable.

16
00:00:55,423 --> 00:00:58,140
Hear that? The
gurgling? That's its song.

17
00:00:58,225 --> 00:01:00,041
See that? Look how it twitches.

18
00:01:00,127 --> 00:01:03,879
One wrong move, one
misstep, and this patient is dead.

19
00:01:03,964 --> 00:01:07,883
You can't repair that
mamba without moving

20
00:01:07,951 --> 00:01:09,562
with the mamba.

21
00:01:09,586 --> 00:01:11,786
Some people say it's
impossible to repair.

22
00:01:11,855 --> 00:01:13,121
<i>One moment that forces you</i>

23
00:01:13,189 --> 00:01:15,841
<i>to re-evaluate everything
you think you know.</i>

24
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:17,442
Come on, mamba.

25
00:01:17,511 --> 00:01:18,793
Let's dance.

26
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:23,059
You paged?

27
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,416
MVC victim.

28
00:01:24,485 --> 00:01:27,319
Wanted you to take a
look at the C-spine X-rays.

29
00:01:28,172 --> 00:01:30,188
Oh, damn. Poor guy.

30
00:01:33,461 --> 00:01:34,660
I just nailed the mamba.

31
00:01:34,728 --> 00:01:36,161
<i>Do you know who you are?</i>

32
00:01:36,213 --> 00:01:39,192
The patient's C3 and 4 are
obliterated. His spinal cord is severed.

33
00:01:39,216 --> 00:01:41,536
There's no way
I can repair that.

34
00:01:42,419 --> 00:01:44,452
<i>Do you know what's
happened to you?</i>

35
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:46,099
But we just fixed his heart.

36
00:01:46,123 --> 00:01:48,523
Against all odds.
'Cause I'm awesome.

37
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:50,109
Yeah, well, even so,

38
00:01:50,177 --> 00:01:52,310
he's lost all motor function
from the neck down.

39
00:01:52,363 --> 00:01:54,663
The man's paralyzed.

40
00:01:57,234 --> 00:01:58,500
<i>Do you want to live this way?</i>

41
00:02:02,506 --> 00:02:04,172
<i>Wait, what?</i>

42
00:02:04,241 --> 00:02:08,042
Unfortunately, the impact of the
crash severed his spinal cord at C3,

43
00:02:08,111 --> 00:02:09,977
which is quite
high in the neck...

44
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:12,024
Yeah, no, I'm a nurse.
I know what C3 is.

45
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:14,216
So you're saying...

46
00:02:14,284 --> 00:02:15,444
He's paralyzed?

47
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:18,269
Yes.

48
00:02:18,339 --> 00:02:19,704
I am so sorry.

49
00:02:19,757 --> 00:02:22,057
But his brain function is good,

50
00:02:22,126 --> 00:02:24,392
and I was able to
fully repair his heart.

51
00:02:24,461 --> 00:02:28,447
Is his diaphragm working?
Can he breathe on his own?

52
00:02:28,515 --> 00:02:31,099
No, he's currently
on a ventilator.

53
00:02:31,168 --> 00:02:35,336
There are options from here,
once he's had time to recover,

54
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:37,939
surgery to fuse his
spine so he can sit up.

55
00:02:38,008 --> 00:02:40,942
We can insert a permanent trach.

56
00:02:41,011 --> 00:02:42,389
These are all options
we can discuss...

57
00:02:42,413 --> 00:02:44,396
Will he ever breathe
on his own again?

58
00:02:45,882 --> 00:02:48,150
No. He will not.

59
00:02:48,218 --> 00:02:50,585
Okay,

60
00:02:50,654 --> 00:02:53,605
I need you to wake
him up right now.

61
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:54,914
You can do that, right?

62
00:02:54,975 --> 00:02:57,242
Elise, your husband just
underwent major surgery.

63
00:02:57,294 --> 00:03:00,195
I know, and now I'm
asking you to wake him up.

64
00:03:00,264 --> 00:03:05,133
And I need you to ask him if
he wants you to remove the vent.

65
00:03:05,201 --> 00:03:07,781
Well, the vent is breathing for
him. It's what's keeping him alive.

66
00:03:07,805 --> 00:03:10,817
I was gonna
surprise him tonight.

67
00:03:10,841 --> 00:03:13,775
As an early anniversary
gift, I got us playoff tickets.

68
00:03:13,861 --> 00:03:16,962
I mean, nosebleed seats,
but we kind of love it up there.

69
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,531
It's like, pretzels and
hot dogs for dinner.

70
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,951
I mean, it's fun.

71
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:27,004
The last thing I thought
when I woke up this morning

72
00:03:27,073 --> 00:03:29,191
was I'd lose Jason.

73
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:34,428
I understand what I'm asking.

74
00:03:34,498 --> 00:03:37,949
Believe me, I don't
want to lose him.

75
00:03:38,018 --> 00:03:40,485
But...

76
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:43,872
I know him. I know
everything about him.

77
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:46,190
I understand how he
thinks. I get his humor.

78
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:48,960
I could predict what he's
gonna order in a restaurant.

79
00:03:49,028 --> 00:03:52,847
And I just... I don't
think he would want this.

80
00:03:53,617 --> 00:03:55,984
I know it.

81
00:03:56,053 --> 00:03:58,120
I think he would rather die

82
00:03:58,188 --> 00:04:01,023
than live one more minute
hooked up to a machine.

83
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,179
It's your husband's
right to decline treatment,

84
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,415
if that's what he wants.

85
00:04:11,385 --> 00:04:12,750
It'll take some time

86
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:14,852
to fully wean him
off the sedation,

87
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:18,156
but I'll let you know
when he starts to wake.

88
00:04:19,442 --> 00:04:21,126
Thank you.

89
00:04:21,195 --> 00:04:22,595
I think she really means it.

90
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:23,962
And that bugs you?

91
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:26,364
No. I mean, maybe. I don't know.

92
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:28,133
It's just... I don't know.

93
00:04:28,202 --> 00:04:31,269
It's not like I want to get
married tomorrow, but never?

94
00:04:31,338 --> 00:04:33,538
But you're with her.

95
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:35,835
If you love her, who cares if
she's not the marrying kind?

96
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:37,726
I wasn't. ALEX:
Yeah, but then you did.

97
00:04:37,794 --> 00:04:39,339
Right, but some people don't.

98
00:04:39,363 --> 00:04:41,629
So, what, we just keep
doing what we're doing

99
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:44,699
for the next 20
years, and that's it?

100
00:04:44,768 --> 00:04:47,869
But if you're together,
what does it matter?

101
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:51,206
Hey!

102
00:04:51,292 --> 00:04:52,424
Hey.

103
00:04:52,493 --> 00:04:53,841
Didn't see you there.

104
00:04:53,911 --> 00:04:55,343
You okay?

105
00:04:56,413 --> 00:04:57,812
Yep.

106
00:04:57,881 --> 00:04:59,313
<i>Jason?</i>

107
00:04:59,383 --> 00:05:01,416
My name is Dr. Yang.

108
00:05:01,485 --> 00:05:03,351
I know you must be
very confused right now,

109
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:07,005
but I need to ask you
some questions, okay?

110
00:05:07,074 --> 00:05:10,591
There's a tube down your
throat, so you can't speak,

111
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:13,461
but you should be
able to nod "yes" or "no."

112
00:05:13,529 --> 00:05:14,862
Think you can do that for me?

113
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:19,000
That's great. Okay.
Let's get started.

114
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:21,419
Do you know who you are?

115
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,590
Do you know where you are?

116
00:05:29,563 --> 00:05:31,429
Do you know what
has happened to you?

117
00:05:34,884 --> 00:05:38,186
You were in a car accident.
Your vehicle was hit from behind,

118
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:40,755
and you flipped over
into oncoming traffic.

119
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:42,623
You're in a hospital right now.

120
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:47,562
Do you know who this is?

121
00:05:51,735 --> 00:05:54,836
Your spine was
crushed in the accident,

122
00:05:54,905 --> 00:05:58,306
and you are paralyzed
from the neck down.

123
00:05:58,392 --> 00:06:00,725
You're currently breathing
with the help of a ventilator.

124
00:06:00,794 --> 00:06:02,076
That's the tube in your mouth.

125
00:06:02,145 --> 00:06:04,762
Now, I understand
it might be your wish

126
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:06,548
for me to remove the vent?

127
00:06:11,421 --> 00:06:14,138
I want to make sure you
understand what this means.

128
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:17,209
The ventilator is
breathing for you.

129
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:20,978
That means, once it's removed,

130
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:23,064
you will not be able
to breathe on your own.

131
00:06:25,518 --> 00:06:27,519
Now, if you can't breathe,

132
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:28,687
you will die.

133
00:06:28,756 --> 00:06:31,823
It might take a few
hours, probably less.

134
00:06:33,594 --> 00:06:34,992
Do you understand this?

135
00:06:36,963 --> 00:06:38,296
Oh, God.

136
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:43,218
Do you still want me
to remove the vent?

137
00:06:45,823 --> 00:06:47,989
I love you.

138
00:06:50,961 --> 00:06:55,063
And I want you to know,
whatever you decide,

139
00:06:56,817 --> 00:06:59,918
I'll support you.

140
00:06:59,987 --> 00:07:03,555
I'll be by your side,
no matter what.

141
00:07:10,998 --> 00:07:14,633
I'm sorry, but I have
to ask one more time.

142
00:07:14,701 --> 00:07:17,268
Jason,

143
00:07:17,337 --> 00:07:19,320
would you like me
to remove the vent?

144
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:48,549
<i>Do you know who you are?</i>

145
00:07:58,028 --> 00:08:00,028
<i>Do you know what's
happened to you?</i>

146
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:06,684
<i>Do you want to live this way?</i>

147
00:08:10,356 --> 00:08:11,756
Oh! God!

148
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:13,874
Hey, you.

149
00:08:13,944 --> 00:08:16,510
What are we doing?
What the hell are we doing?

150
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:19,130
I'm waiting for an elevator?

151
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,765
I just spent my day

152
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,334
saving the life of a man
who's now choosing to die,

153
00:08:23,403 --> 00:08:25,987
and all I keep thinking is...

154
00:08:27,808 --> 00:08:31,576
You and I are
throwing so much away.

155
00:08:31,645 --> 00:08:33,478
We should be together.

156
00:08:33,547 --> 00:08:35,747
You're the love of
my life, and it is stupid,

157
00:08:35,816 --> 00:08:39,217
just stupid for us
to keep pretending.

158
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:41,219
I love you.

159
00:08:41,288 --> 00:08:44,372
I want to be with
you for real, forever.

160
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:46,574
It's as simple as that.

161
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:10,315
That's it. We've christened
every room in this house.

162
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,150
Yeah.

163
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:13,930
And it's a pretty big
house. Mmm-hmm.

164
00:09:13,954 --> 00:09:15,781
I thought I wasn't gonna
make it through the guest room.

165
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:18,525
Yeah, but you rallied at
the end. Mmm-hmm, I did.

166
00:09:19,793 --> 00:09:23,844
You know, the house feels big
for just two of us. Don't you think?

167
00:09:28,101 --> 00:09:30,234
Ah! He is gorgeous.

168
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:32,236
No. Oh.

169
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:34,606
Okay. Um...

170
00:09:34,675 --> 00:09:35,707
This one.

171
00:09:35,776 --> 00:09:36,853
I agreed to a dog,

172
00:09:36,877 --> 00:09:38,076
not a horse.

173
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:39,878
That's a mid-size dog.

174
00:09:39,947 --> 00:09:42,146
No, that is huge. You
know what a big dog makes?

175
00:09:42,215 --> 00:09:43,760
What? Big poop.

176
00:09:43,784 --> 00:09:44,983
That thing could crap

177
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:47,285
my entire body weight in a day.

178
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:49,887
That is a beautiful
image. Thank you.

179
00:09:54,244 --> 00:09:55,326
That one.

180
00:09:55,378 --> 00:09:56,455
What? That's the one.

181
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:57,589
No, no.

182
00:09:57,613 --> 00:09:58,980
That is not even a dog.

183
00:09:59,049 --> 00:10:01,499
That is a rodent,
and it looks mean.

184
00:10:01,568 --> 00:10:04,735
We want this thing in here.
Can someone get it out?

185
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:05,881
Conduit, please.

186
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:07,016
Fresh off the printer.

187
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,739
Kid's tiny for 12 months.

188
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:10,420
He'll grow when
his heart's sending

189
00:10:10,444 --> 00:10:11,988
a little more blood
around the system.

190
00:10:12,012 --> 00:10:13,656
The first couple kids
we put conduits in,

191
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,491
you can already see the
difference in only a year.

192
00:10:15,515 --> 00:10:18,183
So, I have an emergency surgery.

193
00:10:18,251 --> 00:10:19,878
I'm gonna be in the OR
for the next nine hours.

194
00:10:19,902 --> 00:10:21,919
Okay. Mrs. Rodriguez!

195
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:24,789
Oh, no. This is gonna
take me at least three hours.

196
00:10:24,858 --> 00:10:26,518
Well, Mrs. Rodriguez
is not gonna make it.

197
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:27,658
Is she a cardio patient?

198
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:29,761
I could have somebody
page you a consult.

199
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:32,058
Mrs. Rodriguez will last until
I finish here, and then I'll go.

200
00:10:32,082 --> 00:10:33,498
Ross, you'll close for me?

201
00:10:34,417 --> 00:10:35,850
Yeah. Are you sure?

202
00:10:35,918 --> 00:10:37,513
Well, this is why I said we
should keep the damn dog

203
00:10:37,537 --> 00:10:38,764
in the kitchen when we're gone.

204
00:10:38,788 --> 00:10:40,671
I am not locking the
dog in the kitchen.

205
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,468
Well, then you can clean up the
puddle on the rug when you get home.

206
00:10:42,492 --> 00:10:43,586
I'll leave it for you!

207
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:45,126
You got a dog?

208
00:10:46,028 --> 00:10:47,161
Yes.

209
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:48,629
Thing's gonna be dead in a week.

210
00:10:48,698 --> 00:10:51,182
Wait. You named your
dog Mrs. Rodriguez?

211
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,112
When you meet
him, you'll understand.

212
00:10:53,136 --> 00:10:55,553
Meet him soon, before he dies.

213
00:10:55,605 --> 00:10:57,539
What? I'm a physician!

214
00:10:57,607 --> 00:10:59,018
It's not like I'm gonna have
trouble keeping an animal alive.

215
00:10:59,042 --> 00:11:01,693
Uh-huh. Do you have
5-0 prolene, please?

216
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:03,255
What? You think I
can't keep a dog alive?

217
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:04,407
Whatever. Don't worry about it.

218
00:11:04,431 --> 00:11:05,471
He's perfectly healthy.

219
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,700
Alex, it's not funny.

220
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:16,007
I can't believe you're gonna
dress the dog in my son's sweater.

221
00:11:16,075 --> 00:11:18,610
Mrs. Rodriguez gets cold.

222
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,444
He doesn't have the constitution

223
00:11:20,514 --> 00:11:22,046
for all this damp and rain.

224
00:11:22,115 --> 00:11:23,264
He gets the shakes.

225
00:11:25,485 --> 00:11:26,725
What?

226
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:28,086
You like the dog!

227
00:11:28,138 --> 00:11:29,704
He's an unusual dog.

228
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:32,051
It's not like I'm becoming
someone who likes dogs.

229
00:11:32,075 --> 00:11:34,658
He just happens to
relate to people like I do.

230
00:11:34,728 --> 00:11:35,794
Uh-huh.

231
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:37,807
It's true. I mean, he
doesn't want to talk

232
00:11:37,831 --> 00:11:39,675
about his feelings
or the future.

233
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:42,011
If I walk him and feed
him on a regular schedule,

234
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:43,913
he'll curl up next
to me on the couch,

235
00:11:43,937 --> 00:11:45,781
and if I don't, he'll
bite my ankles.

236
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:47,950
It's a set of behaviors
that makes sense to me.

237
00:11:47,974 --> 00:11:49,174
You like the dog.

238
00:11:49,242 --> 00:11:51,092
The dog gets you.

239
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,961
You're alike. That's how
I talk about my children.

240
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:57,593
You have a baby. A dog baby. Oh!

241
00:11:59,068 --> 00:12:00,368
Mrs. Rodriguez!

242
00:12:02,806 --> 00:12:03,916
I'm sorry.

243
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,050
I know how painful it is.

244
00:12:05,074 --> 00:12:06,507
I've been through it myself,

245
00:12:06,576 --> 00:12:08,404
but it's been over two
years since the injury,

246
00:12:08,428 --> 00:12:10,272
and at some point, you just
have to say enough is enough.

247
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:11,723
What? No. You
have no idea where...

248
00:12:11,747 --> 00:12:13,543
Look, your hand needs
more time, all right?

249
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:15,611
Just give your hand rest,
throw yourself into the rehab.

250
00:12:15,635 --> 00:12:17,813
I've done the rehab!
It's been two years!

251
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:19,431
It's done, okay? I'm
good enough to operate.

252
00:12:19,455 --> 00:12:22,240
I mean, what is this? Is
this about Mr. Willenstein?

253
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:23,385
That was a routine...

254
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,309
The decision has been made.

255
00:12:25,378 --> 00:12:27,244
You can keep your
administrative duties,

256
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:29,530
but you are not
cleared to operate.

257
00:12:29,599 --> 00:12:31,239
You're not going back in the OR.

258
00:12:40,777 --> 00:12:42,521
Any other business
before we adjourn?

259
00:12:42,545 --> 00:12:44,712
Actually, yes, there is.

260
00:12:46,816 --> 00:12:48,327
<i>You had to bring
it up to the board!</i>

261
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:49,934
Yeah. It was time.

262
00:12:50,003 --> 00:12:51,269
It absolutely was not time.

263
00:12:51,338 --> 00:12:52,848
We didn't make the decision yet.

264
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:55,306
Well, clearly, I'm
wrong, 'cause we did.

265
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:56,707
I just wasn't part of it.

266
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:57,776
Listen,

267
00:12:57,844 --> 00:12:59,543
it is the job of a lifetime.

268
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:02,913
Running the entire military
trauma division with Teddy,

269
00:13:02,983 --> 00:13:05,783
it's what's next for me,
Cristina. I can feel it.

270
00:13:05,852 --> 00:13:07,352
Yeah, in Germany!

271
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,954
We have a house!
I have my trial!

272
00:13:11,391 --> 00:13:13,269
We are good here,
Owen. We're happy.

273
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:14,971
We can't just leave everything.

274
00:13:14,995 --> 00:13:16,439
Just listen to me
for one second...

275
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:17,703
No. No. You want to know what?

276
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:19,208
You're not backing me into this.

277
00:13:19,232 --> 00:13:21,210
Come on. Nobody
backs you into anything.

278
00:13:21,234 --> 00:13:22,400
Believe me. I've tried.

279
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:23,712
So, you want me to
dump my whole trial,

280
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:25,348
just when I'm starting to get...

281
00:13:25,372 --> 00:13:27,049
That is not what
I'm... Please stop.

282
00:13:27,073 --> 00:13:28,184
Stop acting like you're some

283
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:29,448
hit-and-run victim.

284
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:30,936
I can't have
another conversation

285
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,727
where the idea that my career

286
00:13:32,796 --> 00:13:34,428
or, in fact, any of my wishes

287
00:13:34,497 --> 00:13:35,696
might come first

288
00:13:35,765 --> 00:13:37,465
is presented as some

289
00:13:37,533 --> 00:13:38,773
crime against humanity!

290
00:13:38,801 --> 00:13:40,112
Oh, what?

291
00:13:40,136 --> 00:13:41,780
So, now we're back
where we started?

292
00:13:41,804 --> 00:13:43,003
I never give you anything,

293
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:44,583
so the terms under
which we're together

294
00:13:44,607 --> 00:13:46,891
are that your dreams die?

295
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,487
Can you quiet the damn dog?

296
00:13:48,511 --> 00:13:50,572
You know what? You quiet the
damn dog. You wanted the dog.

297
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:52,741
Not that dog! He doesn't
even like me. He only likes you.

298
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:55,611
Because you make stupid
decisions! And he knows it!

299
00:13:55,635 --> 00:13:57,985
I'm not moving to Germany!

300
00:13:59,322 --> 00:14:00,799
So, that's it?
Conversation's over?

301
00:14:00,823 --> 00:14:02,190
Uh-huh.

302
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:04,192
Of course it is.

303
00:14:05,662 --> 00:14:06,761
I don't know why

304
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:08,507
I ever entertained the
idea for one second

305
00:14:08,531 --> 00:14:11,699
that we might ever do
anything that I'd want.

306
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:17,972
Shh!

307
00:14:19,658 --> 00:14:21,642
Coming through! Dr. Yang!

308
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:23,244
Whatever it is, it can wait.

309
00:14:23,313 --> 00:14:24,957
My shift is over,
and I am going home.

310
00:14:24,981 --> 00:14:26,780
Come on. Patient
11... Jasper O'Neil.

311
00:14:26,849 --> 00:14:28,560
He's back for his
annual checkup.

312
00:14:28,584 --> 00:14:30,568
Apparently, he's
learning to play hockey.

313
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:32,548
You handle it. Send him my best.

314
00:14:32,572 --> 00:14:34,172
But if my conduit gets smashed

315
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,874
because they let their kid
get body-checked on the ice,

316
00:14:36,943 --> 00:14:38,876
I'm killing them! Will do.

317
00:14:38,945 --> 00:14:40,185
Oh! Hi!

318
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:41,486
Hey! Who'd have thunk it?

319
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:43,625
You and me, we're belly buddies.

320
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:45,083
No, we're not.

321
00:14:51,457 --> 00:14:52,568
Breathe. It's okay.
You're almost there.

322
00:14:52,592 --> 00:14:53,769
All you have to do is push.

323
00:14:53,793 --> 00:14:55,192
No. No can do.

324
00:14:55,261 --> 00:14:57,072
We are almost there. He's
gonna have to stay in there.

325
00:14:57,096 --> 00:14:59,797
I've got a cozy womb.
He'll be happier.

326
00:14:59,866 --> 00:15:01,799
It'll be better for everyone.

327
00:15:01,868 --> 00:15:03,333
Oh, my God! Oh, God! Oh, God!

328
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:04,914
Wait a second. You have
to wait a second. No, I can't.

329
00:15:04,938 --> 00:15:06,604
You have to wait one second.

330
00:15:06,673 --> 00:15:09,006
Oh, God. This is a
mistake. It's a mistake!

331
00:15:09,058 --> 00:15:10,820
I Can't! I can't! What?

332
00:15:10,844 --> 00:15:11,959
This is a mistake, Mer!

333
00:15:12,028 --> 00:15:13,268
Everyone says that.

334
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:14,890
Here we go. We
need one more push.

335
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,714
Okay, now!

336
00:15:16,783 --> 00:15:18,515
Push! Push! Push!

337
00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:24,588
Great!

338
00:15:45,845 --> 00:15:47,411
I screwed up, Mer.

339
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:51,265
Mer, I screwed up.
I really screwed up.

340
00:15:51,734 --> 00:15:53,317
Shh.

341
00:15:53,386 --> 00:15:54,518
I can't...

342
00:16:03,046 --> 00:16:04,046
Oh...

343
00:16:06,949 --> 00:16:08,181
Hello.

344
00:16:12,088 --> 00:16:15,123
Oh. Go back to
sleep. I got this.

345
00:16:15,191 --> 00:16:16,523
Okay.

346
00:16:53,329 --> 00:16:54,394
It's okay.

347
00:16:54,463 --> 00:16:55,496
You're being so good.

348
00:16:55,564 --> 00:16:57,531
Yeah. He's fine. He's fine.

349
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:02,970
This is all my fault. You
know, I was at the park,

350
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:05,119
and I looked away for a
second when Ross texted me.

351
00:17:05,174 --> 00:17:06,473
I was standing right there.

352
00:17:06,542 --> 00:17:08,320
Listen, it's okay.
These things happen.

353
00:17:08,344 --> 00:17:09,694
And have you met our son?

354
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:11,356
He lunges headfirst
into everything.

355
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:12,808
It's a wonder this
never happened sooner.

356
00:17:12,832 --> 00:17:14,464
Well, we can't go
back to that park.

357
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:17,146
They need, like, sand or
some of that soft turf stuff.

358
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:19,581
I mean, who puts concrete
steps by a play space?

359
00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:20,783
It's completely irresponsible.

360
00:17:20,807 --> 00:17:22,773
It is a superficial cut.
He's gonna be fine.

361
00:17:22,842 --> 00:17:24,152
I'm already late for my meeting.

362
00:17:24,176 --> 00:17:25,976
I can't just stick
him in daycare.

363
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:29,179
Slow down. Slow down, okay?

364
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:30,793
Now, we're gonna
figure this out.

365
00:17:30,817 --> 00:17:34,151
And, by the way, daycare
has very capable teachers.

366
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,987
Oh, please. I am capable.

367
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,084
So, your text said, "Make
sure the phase 3 patients go."

368
00:17:39,108 --> 00:17:41,392
Go to the bathroom? Go away?

369
00:17:41,461 --> 00:17:42,938
Sorry. I didn't
realize. Is he okay?

370
00:17:42,962 --> 00:17:44,590
Yes. No.

371
00:17:44,614 --> 00:17:46,508
Do you want me to reschedule
the phase 3 patient meetings today,

372
00:17:46,532 --> 00:17:47,993
maybe try to squeeze
them in next week, or...

373
00:17:48,017 --> 00:17:50,534
No, just...

374
00:17:50,603 --> 00:17:52,781
Ross, will you take them?
You understand the procedure.

375
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:54,572
You know what to do. Just...

376
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,535
You know, I want you to
take over phase 3 from here.

377
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:58,225
What? Are you sure?

378
00:17:58,294 --> 00:18:01,345
Yes. Can you do this for
me? Just do this for me, okay?

379
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:04,148
Of course, if that's
what you want.

380
00:18:16,913 --> 00:18:20,214
I can't believe
Bailey's already seven.

381
00:18:20,282 --> 00:18:22,717
Please tell me he has
outgrown that whole

382
00:18:22,785 --> 00:18:24,819
"I fiddle with my
junk 24/7" phase,

383
00:18:24,888 --> 00:18:27,254
'cause I have to practically
duct-tape Theo's pants

384
00:18:27,323 --> 00:18:29,924
onto his body.

385
00:18:29,993 --> 00:18:33,394
Of all the conversations that
you and I have had about boys,

386
00:18:33,462 --> 00:18:34,782
I didn't expect
this one to be it.

387
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,402
Feel any kicks yet?

388
00:18:42,471 --> 00:18:44,605
No, not really.

389
00:18:46,341 --> 00:18:48,341
Nauseous? Just tired.

390
00:18:51,163 --> 00:18:54,765
Every day, I go to
work and do my job.

391
00:18:54,834 --> 00:18:56,566
Then I come home
and do that job.

392
00:18:57,754 --> 00:19:00,054
I'm so tired.

393
00:19:00,123 --> 00:19:01,856
It's like I'm
sleepwalking all the time.

394
00:19:01,924 --> 00:19:05,158
Well, you're well into
your second trimester now,

395
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:06,772
so that'll start getting better.

396
00:19:06,796 --> 00:19:09,112
It's not the pregnancy.

397
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:11,582
Cristina...

398
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:14,702
Look how happy he is.

399
00:19:24,347 --> 00:19:27,048
You're not dressed?

400
00:19:27,116 --> 00:19:29,317
We need to get going.

401
00:19:29,385 --> 00:19:32,736
The Harper Avery Awards await.

402
00:19:32,805 --> 00:19:36,490
Are you nervous? Are you okay?

403
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:37,799
Do you need a minute?

404
00:19:37,827 --> 00:19:40,160
No.

405
00:19:40,229 --> 00:19:41,579
Maybe.

406
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:44,548
Okay. But just a minute.

407
00:19:44,617 --> 00:19:45,916
And then nerves of steel.

408
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:47,562
Right?

409
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:48,586
Right.

410
00:19:48,654 --> 00:19:49,894
Okay.

411
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:55,709
<i>The surgical mind needs
to be constantly inspired,</i>

412
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:58,595
always asking the
toughest questions.

413
00:19:58,664 --> 00:20:02,399
The Harper Avery Award
is a celebration of that,

414
00:20:02,468 --> 00:20:06,837
of the kind of mind I
saw in tonight's recipient,

415
00:20:06,905 --> 00:20:10,608
even when he was just an intern.

416
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:13,310
Ladies and gentlemen, I
am honored to present to you

417
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:15,879
this year's Harper
Avery Award recipient

418
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:17,865
to Dr. Shane Ross.

419
00:20:30,296 --> 00:20:32,679
Thank you. Thank you.

420
00:20:32,765 --> 00:20:35,532
First and foremost, I'd
like to thank Dr. Yang.

421
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:39,102
I wouldn't be here
without your guidance,

422
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:41,454
encouragement, and support.

423
00:20:43,309 --> 00:20:46,210
All it takes is one
person, one patient

424
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:50,747
to change your life forever.

425
00:20:50,816 --> 00:20:53,162
When I first met Jasper
O'Neil, he was 12 months old,

426
00:20:53,186 --> 00:20:56,520
and we didn't think
he'd make it to 13.

427
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:58,155
He's here with us tonight.

428
00:20:58,224 --> 00:21:00,991
Jasper, would you
stand up, please?

429
00:21:09,218 --> 00:21:11,618
Cristina. Cristina.

430
00:21:13,022 --> 00:21:16,373
<i>Do you know who you are?</i>

431
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:19,876
<i>Do you know what's
happened to you?</i>

432
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:22,079
<i>Do you want to live this way?</i>

433
00:21:22,148 --> 00:21:23,208
<i>I love you.</i>

434
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:29,353
And I want you to know
that whatever you decide,

435
00:21:29,422 --> 00:21:32,756
I'll support you.

436
00:21:32,825 --> 00:21:34,224
I'll be by your side...

437
00:21:35,644 --> 00:21:37,278
No matter what.

438
00:21:38,847 --> 00:21:42,716
I'm sorry, but I have
to ask one more time.

439
00:21:42,785 --> 00:21:45,019
Jason,

440
00:21:45,087 --> 00:21:47,137
would you like me
to remove the vent?

441
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:28,156
Ah!

442
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,220
Son of a...

443
00:22:30,166 --> 00:22:31,565
Hey, you.

444
00:22:31,634 --> 00:22:33,211
I just spent my day
saving the life of a man

445
00:22:33,235 --> 00:22:35,819
who could've chosen
to die but didn't.

446
00:22:35,888 --> 00:22:40,123
I repaired a heart that
was impossible to repair.

447
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:44,745
I achieved the impossible
today, and it feels good.

448
00:22:44,814 --> 00:22:47,264
No. More.

449
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:49,766
It feels incredible.

450
00:22:52,355 --> 00:22:53,595
What are you doing right now?

451
00:22:54,957 --> 00:22:57,191
Waiting for the elevator.

452
00:22:57,259 --> 00:22:59,237
Yeah. We're gonna
have to take the stairs,

453
00:22:59,261 --> 00:23:02,095
'cause I just finished my
shift, and I feel like celebrating.

454
00:23:02,164 --> 00:23:03,480
Tonight...

455
00:23:04,182 --> 00:23:06,216
Naked. With you.

456
00:23:06,285 --> 00:23:08,501
Oh. I could be into that.

457
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:24,885
Are you

458
00:23:24,954 --> 00:23:26,920
sure you're okay with this?

459
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:32,193
Oh, yeah, yeah. I'm very sure.

460
00:23:32,278 --> 00:23:33,722
No, no.

461
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:34,986
No, not... Not this.

462
00:23:37,366 --> 00:23:40,100
Us being

463
00:23:42,037 --> 00:23:43,954
just us.

464
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:47,958
I know.

465
00:23:48,026 --> 00:23:50,260
And I'm good.

466
00:23:50,329 --> 00:23:51,495
I am.

467
00:23:54,066 --> 00:23:56,366
You said you were
okay. You told me...

468
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:58,313
You told me that... I thought
I was, okay? But I'm not.

469
00:23:58,337 --> 00:23:59,537
What does that...

470
00:23:59,572 --> 00:24:00,704
I just need my films.

471
00:24:02,958 --> 00:24:06,076
Not right this second, though.

472
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:09,112
Listen, all I am asking

473
00:24:09,181 --> 00:24:11,498
is that we just reopen
this conversation.

474
00:24:11,567 --> 00:24:13,177
There is nothing
left to talk about.

475
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:15,753
Owen, I was clear
about this. I was so clear.

476
00:24:15,822 --> 00:24:18,672
I can't give you more than
what I am already giving,

477
00:24:18,741 --> 00:24:19,885
and if now you need more...

478
00:24:19,909 --> 00:24:21,808
Yes, I think I do! I think I do!

479
00:24:21,878 --> 00:24:23,478
Well, then get it
somewhere else.

480
00:24:25,731 --> 00:24:26,731
Oh.

481
00:24:29,668 --> 00:24:30,684
Okay, I will.

482
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:42,695
<i>It's over.</i>

483
00:24:42,764 --> 00:24:45,783
No, this time, Owen
and I are really over.

484
00:24:45,851 --> 00:24:48,786
I mean, we can't keep falling
back into the same pattern.

485
00:24:48,854 --> 00:24:51,588
It's just...

486
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:54,658
Mer? You awake?

487
00:24:54,727 --> 00:24:58,495
Yeah. You and
Owen are over again.

488
00:24:58,564 --> 00:25:00,931
I'm totally listening. Continue.

489
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:02,333
Well, see? That's the point...

490
00:25:02,401 --> 00:25:04,435
It can't continue the way it is.

491
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:06,704
It's not good, it's not healthy.

492
00:25:06,772 --> 00:25:08,416
Your heart's healthy enough now

493
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,785
that you'd be an
excellent candidate

494
00:25:09,809 --> 00:25:10,986
for the type of
research they're doing.

495
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:12,075
Mmm-hmm.

496
00:25:12,144 --> 00:25:13,611
Could it hurt him?

497
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,395
No. It is a surgery.

498
00:25:15,464 --> 00:25:18,176
I would implant an array of
wireless sensors into his skull

499
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,144
that would transmit
electrical activity.

500
00:25:20,168 --> 00:25:22,147
But none of our subjects
ever complained of pain.

501
00:25:22,171 --> 00:25:24,182
It's a chance to help us, to
help revolutionize treatment

502
00:25:24,206 --> 00:25:26,468
for people like yourself. Hmm?

503
00:25:26,492 --> 00:25:27,732
What do you think, hon?

504
00:25:30,379 --> 00:25:33,847
It'll help "people like me."

505
00:25:33,915 --> 00:25:35,482
It won't help me?

506
00:25:35,551 --> 00:25:39,036
Honey, wouldn't it be
nice to have a place to go

507
00:25:39,105 --> 00:25:41,199
instead of sitting
around the house all day?

508
00:25:41,223 --> 00:25:43,857
It's something, Jason.
It's something we can do.

509
00:25:44,693 --> 00:25:45,859
Please?

510
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:49,346
I don't care.

511
00:25:49,415 --> 00:25:50,447
Fine.

512
00:25:56,439 --> 00:25:59,339
Thank you, Dr. Yang,
for thinking of us.

513
00:25:59,408 --> 00:26:02,242
Oh, no, actually, it
was Chief Hunt's idea.

514
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:03,388
He told us about Jason.

515
00:26:04,513 --> 00:26:06,930
Oh, well, thank you, Dr. Hunt.

516
00:26:06,999 --> 00:26:08,515
It's gonna be great for him.

517
00:26:08,583 --> 00:26:09,983
Well, good luck.

518
00:26:13,756 --> 00:26:15,088
What?

519
00:26:15,157 --> 00:26:17,057
That was a really nice
thing you did for them.

520
00:26:17,142 --> 00:26:18,742
Well,

521
00:26:18,811 --> 00:26:22,512
I'm a really nice guy,
or so I've been told.

522
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:24,492
<i>I would never ask you for that.</i>

523
00:26:24,516 --> 00:26:26,249
You're not asking.
I am telling you.

524
00:26:26,318 --> 00:26:28,485
Well...

525
00:26:28,553 --> 00:26:30,386
I don't believe you.

526
00:26:30,455 --> 00:26:33,190
Cristina, people change.

527
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:35,926
I mean, you're not the same
person that you were when we met.

528
00:26:35,995 --> 00:26:37,194
I can change, too.

529
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:39,697
Really?

530
00:26:39,765 --> 00:26:44,101
People who want kids
don't just stop wanting them.

531
00:26:46,872 --> 00:26:48,238
Don't give up things for me.

532
00:26:48,307 --> 00:26:51,274
Hey, I'm not.

533
00:26:51,343 --> 00:26:53,010
I haven't.

534
00:26:55,481 --> 00:26:57,481
I'm not giving up anything.

535
00:27:03,805 --> 00:27:05,600
Good.

536
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,591
Good. Good.

537
00:27:07,659 --> 00:27:09,392
Yeah, slowly but surely.

538
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:11,728
Just focus on your balance.

539
00:27:13,616 --> 00:27:17,067
How does it feel,
Jase, to walk again?

540
00:27:17,136 --> 00:27:20,620
It's pretty good.

541
00:27:20,689 --> 00:27:22,409
Yeah, I think he
needs to concentrate.

542
00:27:25,628 --> 00:27:28,195
It's amazing, in
just a few years.

543
00:27:28,263 --> 00:27:30,113
Unbelievable.

544
00:27:30,182 --> 00:27:32,427
Is Dr. Yang busy? I would
love for her to see this.

545
00:27:32,451 --> 00:27:34,018
Let me check, okay?

546
00:27:34,086 --> 00:27:35,936
Jason, are you all right?

547
00:27:36,889 --> 00:27:38,649
Jason!

548
00:27:39,591 --> 00:27:40,631
Get a crash cart!

549
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:41,725
Jason?

550
00:27:46,782 --> 00:27:47,931
I need you.

551
00:27:48,684 --> 00:27:49,850
Yes.

552
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:51,284
No. I can't.

553
00:27:51,353 --> 00:27:53,598
These abstracts were
supposed to go out an hour ago.

554
00:27:53,622 --> 00:27:55,233
You know what? Okay.
On-call room, but fast?

555
00:27:55,257 --> 00:27:57,457
No, no, it's not...
It's Jason Castor.

556
00:27:57,525 --> 00:27:59,054
He just had an
accident in the BCI lab.

557
00:27:59,078 --> 00:28:01,261
He has rhabdo, renal failure.

558
00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:05,982
Grey is putting a shunt in him,
but his wife's asking for you.

559
00:28:06,051 --> 00:28:08,935
Jason Castor, your
patient, the quadriplegic?

560
00:28:09,004 --> 00:28:10,904
We put him into
Derek and Callie's trial.

561
00:28:10,973 --> 00:28:12,205
His wife is...

562
00:28:12,274 --> 00:28:13,451
Right, right, right. Yes.

563
00:28:13,475 --> 00:28:15,025
Does he need a heart consult?

564
00:28:15,094 --> 00:28:17,561
No, no. She's just scared,
and she trusts you...

565
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:19,763
You know, Owen,
I have to finish this.

566
00:28:19,832 --> 00:28:21,114
I've got seven prints going.

567
00:28:21,183 --> 00:28:22,449
Where's Ross?

568
00:28:22,518 --> 00:28:23,758
Ross can't do this.

569
00:28:23,802 --> 00:28:26,086
I'm one step away from
funding for animal trials.

570
00:28:28,657 --> 00:28:30,535
Owen, he's not my
patient anymore.

571
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:31,958
If the guy's heart is fine,

572
00:28:32,027 --> 00:28:34,507
I don't have time to hold
someone's hand right now.

573
00:28:39,368 --> 00:28:41,768
You know what? You
saved her husband's life.

574
00:28:41,837 --> 00:28:43,447
You were the first
doctor she met.

575
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:45,550
She likes you, she trusts you,
and now she's waiting for you.

576
00:28:45,574 --> 00:28:48,041
About a million heart
patients are waiting for me, too.

577
00:28:49,862 --> 00:28:51,795
Right.

578
00:28:51,864 --> 00:28:53,730
You can't let people down.

579
00:28:59,705 --> 00:29:00,871
Hey.

580
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:05,008
Thanks.

581
00:29:06,245 --> 00:29:07,510
Was it because of the suit?

582
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:10,391
No. His kidneys failed, and
that caused him to pass out.

583
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:12,649
But the surgery is going well,

584
00:29:12,718 --> 00:29:14,584
and then we'll get
him on dialysis.

585
00:29:14,653 --> 00:29:19,923
This is just a complication
of Jason's condition.

586
00:29:19,992 --> 00:29:22,993
It's all just complications.

587
00:29:23,062 --> 00:29:25,073
And he should be able to
continue with the study, so...

588
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:26,263
He won't.

589
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,200
Yeah, this will be his excuse,

590
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:32,263
and he'll never forgive
me for making him do it.

591
00:29:32,287 --> 00:29:34,922
What? You didn't
make him do this.

592
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:37,201
He told me once,
we were fighting,

593
00:29:37,225 --> 00:29:39,509
and he told me that
when we woke him

594
00:29:39,578 --> 00:29:42,312
to ask him if he wanted to live,

595
00:29:42,381 --> 00:29:45,865
he only said yes because
he was looking at me,

596
00:29:45,934 --> 00:29:48,835
that if it had been up to him,

597
00:29:48,904 --> 00:29:51,171
if I wasn't there,

598
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,406
he would have said no.

599
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,993
So all this is because of me.

600
00:29:57,062 --> 00:29:58,706
I mean, he's miserable
every day because of me.

601
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:00,864
And I'm not a wife anymore.

602
00:30:00,916 --> 00:30:03,817
I'm a nursemaid and
a cook and an orderly,

603
00:30:03,886 --> 00:30:05,963
and I never go
home from that work.

604
00:30:05,987 --> 00:30:09,489
I am that work. That's
all I am anymore.

605
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:16,613
I wanted to have a child.

606
00:30:20,769 --> 00:30:23,253
And I will never,
ever have a child.

607
00:30:26,125 --> 00:30:28,192
I'm sorry.

608
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:29,938
I'm being selfish and horrible.

609
00:30:29,962 --> 00:30:32,412
No, you're not. No,
no, no. Not at all.

610
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,431
Not at all. I
totally understand.

611
00:30:46,411 --> 00:30:48,211
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

612
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,080
No. It's okay.

613
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:54,017
<i>Get on out!</i>

614
00:30:54,086 --> 00:30:56,687
<i>Okay, now, that is
a healthy heart sip</i>

615
00:30:56,755 --> 00:30:59,455
<i>that's both delicious
and nutritious.</i>

616
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:01,725
<i>Thank you very much for that.</i>

617
00:31:01,794 --> 00:31:06,596
<i>Next up, I'm going
to debunk the top five</i>

618
00:31:06,665 --> 00:31:10,266
<i>biggest health myths for you
folks, coming up right after this.</i>

619
00:31:10,335 --> 00:31:13,469
She better include my
suggestion on too much calcium

620
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:16,339
increasing your
risk of heart disease.

621
00:31:16,408 --> 00:31:18,775
People pop those
pills like candy.

622
00:31:22,181 --> 00:31:23,892
I haven't seen you in two days.

623
00:31:23,916 --> 00:31:25,756
Yeah, I took a couple
extra night shifts.

624
00:31:25,784 --> 00:31:27,495
I went by the
trailer this morning.

625
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:30,120
Yeah, I just crashed
in the on-call room.

626
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:37,077
Is something going on?

627
00:31:45,254 --> 00:31:48,538
I need more, Cristina. You know?

628
00:31:48,607 --> 00:31:51,308
I just can't keep...

629
00:31:51,377 --> 00:31:53,043
I just need more, you know.

630
00:31:53,112 --> 00:31:56,196
More from you, more from us.

631
00:31:56,264 --> 00:31:58,424
- Another, please?
- You got it!

632
00:31:58,967 --> 00:32:00,478
Okay, let's just
get out of here.

633
00:32:00,502 --> 00:32:01,646
Nope.

634
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:03,214
Let's go home.
Just sleep this off,

635
00:32:03,238 --> 00:32:04,732
and let's talk about it
in the morning, can we...

636
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,996
We don't have a home, Cristina.

637
00:32:07,059 --> 00:32:09,943
I have a trailer, and you
have a room at Karev's house.

638
00:32:10,012 --> 00:32:11,511
It's not...

639
00:32:14,049 --> 00:32:15,126
Another, please.

640
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:16,216
Right up!

641
00:32:27,829 --> 00:32:29,949
There you go. Thank you.

642
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:32,665
There's too many.

643
00:32:32,734 --> 00:32:34,334
The kids outnumber the adults.

644
00:32:34,403 --> 00:32:36,903
Should've thought of that
before we adopted again.

645
00:32:36,971 --> 00:32:39,817
I mean, what if there's a
mutiny? Derek and I will lose.

646
00:32:39,841 --> 00:32:42,509
Well, not until the
third one can walk.

647
00:32:43,811 --> 00:32:45,811
So, you broke up again?

648
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:52,352
Same thing, over and over.

649
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:59,125
You know what else is the same?

650
00:32:59,194 --> 00:33:01,827
This.

651
00:33:01,896 --> 00:33:06,199
You and I laying in this bed,
talking about you and Owen.

652
00:33:06,268 --> 00:33:08,768
Why do you keep
doing this to yourself?

653
00:33:12,741 --> 00:33:14,240
I need help.

654
00:33:19,013 --> 00:33:20,296
Mer, you have to help me.

655
00:33:21,766 --> 00:33:23,349
Don't let me go back to him,

656
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:26,085
for his good and mine.

657
00:33:26,655 --> 00:33:28,271
Please help me.

658
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:31,508
Of course. Of
course I'll help you.

659
00:33:37,632 --> 00:33:39,744
What do you mean? It's been six
months since my last procedure!

660
00:33:39,768 --> 00:33:41,000
Your hand's still not healed!

661
00:33:41,069 --> 00:33:44,037
You need more PT and
more time in the skills lab.

662
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:45,705
You are not
stepping into that OR,

663
00:33:45,774 --> 00:33:47,474
not today, maybe not ever!

664
00:33:47,543 --> 00:33:49,103
All right, first of all, you
need to lower your voice.

665
00:33:49,127 --> 00:33:51,227
Okay, so what,
nobody can yell at you?

666
00:33:51,296 --> 00:33:53,274
Why's that? Why is that?
Because you're an Avery?

667
00:33:53,298 --> 00:33:54,759
That has nothing to do
with any of this, and you...

668
00:33:54,783 --> 00:33:57,383
Some pampered little rich
boy who was gifted a hospital,

669
00:33:57,453 --> 00:34:01,054
so he thinks that it's okay to
go ahead and endanger patients,

670
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:04,006
'cause he's too damn proud to
admit that he can't operate anymore!

671
00:34:04,076 --> 00:34:05,125
Dr. Hunt!

672
00:34:15,954 --> 00:34:17,532
Do you know how many infants

673
00:34:17,556 --> 00:34:19,534
are born without a
pulmonary artery?

674
00:34:19,558 --> 00:34:20,823
Cristina, I'm so sorry.

675
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:22,570
But there is a
surgery to correct it.

676
00:34:22,594 --> 00:34:24,160
It's called unifocalization,

677
00:34:24,229 --> 00:34:26,374
which I was doing with a robot.

678
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:27,638
But now Shane is finishing it

679
00:34:27,682 --> 00:34:29,660
because you paged me
"911" like a million times.

680
00:34:29,684 --> 00:34:30,861
So whatever it
is, it better be...

681
00:34:30,885 --> 00:34:31,968
It's Owen.

682
00:34:33,388 --> 00:34:35,483
He wanted to work a shift.
I didn't feel comfortable.

683
00:34:35,507 --> 00:34:37,590
He only agreed to get
in a bed if I paged you.

684
00:34:39,361 --> 00:34:40,477
You came.

685
00:34:42,764 --> 00:34:44,004
Give us a minute.

686
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:53,951
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

687
00:34:53,975 --> 00:34:55,815
Oh, God, you stink.

688
00:34:57,846 --> 00:34:59,529
You tried to start a shift?

689
00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:01,965
Are you insane? You
could've hurt someone.

690
00:35:02,033 --> 00:35:04,301
Yeah. Yeah. I love you.

691
00:35:07,622 --> 00:35:09,523
This has got to
stop. I love you.

692
00:35:09,591 --> 00:35:12,859
I love you. I love you,

693
00:35:12,928 --> 00:35:15,529
and I see you every day,

694
00:35:15,597 --> 00:35:17,637
and I can't have you.

695
00:35:19,517 --> 00:35:21,550
So how am I supposed
to keep doing this,

696
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:24,470
keep working here,

697
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:27,040
when every time I turn around,

698
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:30,577
I see your face?

699
00:35:31,163 --> 00:35:32,562
Owen...

700
00:35:34,099 --> 00:35:36,115
Owen, Owen, Owen, Owen...

701
00:35:36,184 --> 00:35:41,037
I love you. Please. Please.
Please marry me. Just marry me.

702
00:35:41,106 --> 00:35:43,573
Owen... Why can't
you just marry me?

703
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:45,758
Please, I'm begging
you. I'm begging.

704
00:35:45,844 --> 00:35:47,344
I am begging you.

705
00:35:47,412 --> 00:35:49,223
I mean, we should
never have called it quits.

706
00:35:49,247 --> 00:35:52,515
We should never have called
it quits when we did. Please.

707
00:36:01,026 --> 00:36:02,258
Please marry me.

708
00:36:13,805 --> 00:36:15,705
Well, there's no
sign of him yet,

709
00:36:15,774 --> 00:36:17,084
but there's still
plenty of time,

710
00:36:17,108 --> 00:36:18,542
so there's no reason to panic.

711
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:20,037
I'm not panicked. Okay.

712
00:36:20,061 --> 00:36:21,995
Can you get my belt? Sure.

713
00:36:26,835 --> 00:36:28,367
You look beautiful.

714
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:29,936
Thanks.

715
00:36:30,005 --> 00:36:32,889
He is late. How could
he be late to this?

716
00:36:32,957 --> 00:36:34,957
I'll go look for him again.

717
00:36:41,649 --> 00:36:43,161
Okay, we've got a
full house, people.

718
00:36:43,185 --> 00:36:44,684
Page anyone who's available.

719
00:36:44,752 --> 00:36:46,819
10-Year-old female,
thrown from a vehicle,

720
00:36:46,888 --> 00:36:49,672
multiple blunt injuries
and hypotensive.

721
00:36:49,741 --> 00:36:52,392
Hey, you, assess her, then
rush her up to radiology,

722
00:36:52,461 --> 00:36:54,160
get a CT with contrast.

723
00:36:54,229 --> 00:36:55,740
Then page me as
soon as... Excuse me.

724
00:36:55,764 --> 00:36:57,329
Contrast, like the iodine dye?

725
00:36:57,398 --> 00:36:59,878
I'm allergic to that. Do you
think my daughter could be, too?

726
00:36:59,934 --> 00:37:02,819
We'll run a test and check.
Not a problem. Excuse me.

727
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:04,704
What've you got?

728
00:37:10,862 --> 00:37:12,973
Do you want me
to call him again?

729
00:37:12,997 --> 00:37:14,113
No.

730
00:37:28,046 --> 00:37:30,814
Do you have to take
that? 'Cause you can go.

731
00:37:30,882 --> 00:37:33,817
It's not like you haven't been
through this with me before.

732
00:37:33,885 --> 00:37:37,420
It's a general page,
for whoever's on call.

733
00:37:37,489 --> 00:37:40,055
I'm not even on call.
I'm not going anywhere.

734
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,423
What happened?

735
00:37:46,447 --> 00:37:48,042
She was seizing,
severe allergic reaction.

736
00:37:48,066 --> 00:37:50,344
I was passing by and
saw this intern freaking out.

737
00:37:50,368 --> 00:37:52,435
I've given her a .3 EPI.

738
00:37:52,503 --> 00:37:53,853
Well, did anyone order contrast?

739
00:37:53,922 --> 00:37:55,122
Was she tested for allergies?

740
00:37:55,173 --> 00:37:56,606
I got paged. What's going on?

741
00:37:56,675 --> 00:37:58,491
We need to get her
to the OR immediately.

742
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:01,311
Let's start her on
Benadryl and steroids, stat!

743
00:38:01,379 --> 00:38:03,491
Is this your patient? Yes.

744
00:38:03,515 --> 00:38:05,359
Why didn't you screen her
for any contrast allergies?

745
00:38:05,383 --> 00:38:06,660
I did. It's not here.

746
00:38:06,684 --> 00:38:07,895
I mean, there's no
record of any tests.

747
00:38:07,919 --> 00:38:08,980
I ordered it. You did?

748
00:38:09,004 --> 00:38:10,581
Yes! Yes. You sure? You did?

749
00:38:10,605 --> 00:38:11,854
I ordered the damn test!

750
00:38:13,558 --> 00:38:14,598
Didn't I?

751
00:38:19,414 --> 00:38:21,225
Cutting it a little
close, don't you think?

752
00:38:21,249 --> 00:38:22,982
Hi. Sorry I'm late. I know.

753
00:38:23,051 --> 00:38:24,662
I got held up, and
there was traffic and...

754
00:38:24,686 --> 00:38:26,953
Anyway, sorry. I'm here now.

755
00:38:27,022 --> 00:38:29,038
You look incredible.

756
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:32,015
Thank you.

757
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:34,894
Well, shall we do this?

758
00:38:36,247 --> 00:38:37,646
Let's.

759
00:38:42,053 --> 00:38:43,920
This is unacceptable.

760
00:38:43,989 --> 00:38:45,500
Things like this keep happening,

761
00:38:45,524 --> 00:38:46,934
and this time there
was a kid involved.

762
00:38:46,958 --> 00:38:49,358
And I'm not looking the
other way any longer.

763
00:38:49,427 --> 00:38:51,338
He's unreliable, a
danger to his patients.

764
00:38:51,362 --> 00:38:52,695
I mean...

765
00:38:52,763 --> 00:38:57,200
Did you smell his breath?

766
00:38:57,268 --> 00:38:59,229
Yeah, well, let's just wait
for the breathalyzer results.

767
00:38:59,253 --> 00:39:02,354
No. We need to convene
an emergency board meeting.

768
00:39:02,424 --> 00:39:04,757
Right now, Derek. Right now.

769
00:39:04,826 --> 00:39:07,026
She's a pioneer, an inspiration,

770
00:39:07,095 --> 00:39:09,228
a mentor, and, I'm proud to say,

771
00:39:09,297 --> 00:39:12,464
my friend for over 15 years.

772
00:39:12,533 --> 00:39:13,800
Please welcome,

773
00:39:13,868 --> 00:39:16,046
for an unprecedented
fourth consecutive year,

774
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:18,404
tonight's Harper
Avery Award recipient,

775
00:39:18,472 --> 00:39:19,689
Dr. Cristina Yang.

776
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:26,779
<i>I came as soon as I could.</i>

777
00:39:26,848 --> 00:39:28,915
You know he's just
sitting out there waiting?

778
00:39:28,984 --> 00:39:30,661
April, you run the
trauma department.

779
00:39:30,685 --> 00:39:32,563
You work with him more
closely than anybody else.

780
00:39:32,587 --> 00:39:35,354
Do you trust Owen
Hunt to treat patients?

781
00:39:36,557 --> 00:39:38,057
He is my mentor,

782
00:39:38,126 --> 00:39:39,558
and he trained me.

783
00:39:39,628 --> 00:39:42,528
We value your opinion,
April. That's why you're here.

784
00:39:42,597 --> 00:39:44,797
Just be honest.

785
00:39:44,866 --> 00:39:47,033
Do you trust the man?

786
00:39:58,046 --> 00:40:01,014
No, I don't.

787
00:40:01,082 --> 00:40:03,866
I move to terminate him,
effective immediately.

788
00:40:03,935 --> 00:40:06,619
If there's one thing I've
learned over the years,

789
00:40:06,688 --> 00:40:11,724
it's that it only takes one
person, one patient, one moment,

790
00:40:11,793 --> 00:40:14,460
to change your life forever.

791
00:40:14,529 --> 00:40:18,965
To change your perspective,
color your thinking,

792
00:40:19,033 --> 00:40:23,636
to force you to re-evaluate
everything you think you know.

793
00:40:23,705 --> 00:40:27,623
<i>To make you ask yourself
the toughest questions.</i>

794
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,727
Do you know who you are?

795
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:35,648
<i>Do you understand what
has happened to you?</i>

796
00:40:36,784 --> 00:40:39,018
Do you want to live this way?

797
00:40:42,807 --> 00:40:45,687
<i>I'm sorry, but I have
to ask one more time.</i>

798
00:40:46,578 --> 00:40:49,011
Jason,

799
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,447
would you like me
to remove the vent?

800
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:10,833
Okay.

801
00:41:51,643 --> 00:41:52,643
Hey, watch your hand.

802
00:41:53,762 --> 00:41:54,844
Thanks.

803
00:41:54,912 --> 00:41:55,912
No problem.

804
00:42:00,668 --> 00:42:02,830
Hey, Cristina.
Hey. You got a sec?

805
00:42:02,854 --> 00:42:04,448
I could use a set of
eyes on my patient.

806
00:42:04,472 --> 00:42:05,905
Yeah. Just give me one...

807
00:42:10,744 --> 00:42:12,478
Never mind. What do you got?
