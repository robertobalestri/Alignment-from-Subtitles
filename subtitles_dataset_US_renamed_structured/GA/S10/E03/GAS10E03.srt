1
00:00:03,804 --> 00:00:06,444
<i>There's this playground
game that kids play.</i>

2
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:10,709
I'll get him. You
can't pick him up.

3
00:00:11,912 --> 00:00:13,178
Yes, I can.

4
00:00:13,247 --> 00:00:15,864
No, your incision
needs to heal. I got him.

5
00:00:15,933 --> 00:00:18,934
<i>They lock hands, and
on the count of three,</i>

6
00:00:19,002 --> 00:00:21,031
<i>they try to snap each
other's fingers off.</i>

7
00:00:21,055 --> 00:00:23,415
Hurry up before
he wakes up the...

8
00:00:23,991 --> 00:00:25,340
Mommy?

9
00:00:25,409 --> 00:00:27,409
Girls.

10
00:00:27,477 --> 00:00:28,757
<i>You hold out as long as you can.</i>

11
00:00:32,015 --> 00:00:34,483
<i>Or at least longer
than the other guy.</i>

12
00:00:47,081 --> 00:00:50,498
<i>The game doesn't end
until someone says "stop,"</i>

13
00:00:50,567 --> 00:00:54,036
<i>gives up, cries "mercy."</i>

14
00:00:54,121 --> 00:00:55,954
<i>It isn't a fun game.</i>

15
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:18,121
Move over.

16
00:01:18,145 --> 00:01:19,644
What the hell?

17
00:01:19,713 --> 00:01:21,557
I couldn't sleep all night.

18
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:24,733
I'm bored. Really bored. Nope.

19
00:01:25,953 --> 00:01:26,953
Oh, don't kid yourself.

20
00:01:27,004 --> 00:01:28,487
Call Hunt.

21
00:01:28,555 --> 00:01:30,383
No.

22
00:01:30,407 --> 00:01:32,291
Then try the Internet
like everybody else.

23
00:01:32,343 --> 00:01:33,820
For porn? For dating.

24
00:01:33,844 --> 00:01:36,478
Find somebody
else to get horny with.

25
00:01:36,547 --> 00:01:38,129
I have a girlfriend.

26
00:01:38,198 --> 00:01:39,743
Oh, she's passed
out with her friends.

27
00:01:39,767 --> 00:01:41,099
Again.

28
00:01:41,168 --> 00:01:42,868
Did she ever sleep with you?

29
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:47,890
Did you guys have
sex, and it was awful?

30
00:01:47,975 --> 00:01:49,608
Was she awful? No.

31
00:01:49,676 --> 00:01:51,110
Were you awful,

32
00:01:51,178 --> 00:01:52,989
and now you're so ashamed
you can't even look at her?

33
00:01:53,013 --> 00:01:54,997
No. Oh, was it weird?

34
00:01:55,065 --> 00:01:56,832
Is she a man?

35
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,983
Ooh. Secret penis. Shut up!

36
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:00,330
Well, why don't you
guys ever sleep together?

37
00:02:00,354 --> 00:02:01,954
We will!

38
00:02:02,022 --> 00:02:03,772
Ohh.

39
00:02:03,841 --> 00:02:06,441
You two haven't
done it yet. We do.

40
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:07,687
You do done it? We have.

41
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:09,289
Oh, you have? You do? We do.

42
00:02:09,313 --> 00:02:10,390
Okay. We do!

43
00:02:10,414 --> 00:02:11,991
Just get out! Okay. Hmm.

44
00:02:12,015 --> 00:02:14,026
Okay. Let me just
think about that.

45
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:17,803
'Cause it's been, like, a week
and you haven't closed the deal.

46
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:20,488
What have you
done to evil spawn?

47
00:02:20,558 --> 00:02:21,756
I was sleeping.

48
00:02:24,228 --> 00:02:26,395
Oh, God! I knew
you'd cheer me up.

49
00:02:26,463 --> 00:02:27,495
Mmm!

50
00:02:30,751 --> 00:02:33,552
Would it kill her to bring me more
than one pair of Sofia's socks?

51
00:02:33,621 --> 00:02:35,687
Frickin' thoughtless.

52
00:02:35,756 --> 00:02:37,456
Where are Sofia and Zola?

53
00:02:37,525 --> 00:02:38,735
Um, um, Derek's
putting their shoes on.

54
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:40,759
Ah.

55
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,522
Are you sure you can
handle the both of them?

56
00:02:42,546 --> 00:02:43,845
Yes.

57
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:45,575
They're the only people who
don't piss me off right now.

58
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:46,993
I'll text you when
they're both in day care.

59
00:02:47,017 --> 00:02:48,845
Hi! Ah! You're a goddess.

60
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:51,130
And yet my W-I-F-E
still sleeps around.

61
00:02:51,154 --> 00:02:52,382
Okay, ladies!

62
00:02:52,406 --> 00:02:53,871
Yes, here we go!

63
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,385
Here, take your
duck. Here we go!

64
00:02:55,409 --> 00:02:57,187
Take your duck. We're
going on a ferry ride.

65
00:02:57,211 --> 00:02:59,571
Thank you. Thank
you. Have a good day.

66
00:03:00,797 --> 00:03:04,783
Oh. What are we gonna do when
she fixes her marriage and leaves us?

67
00:03:04,852 --> 00:03:07,297
Oh, I think we're a
ways off from that. Oh.

68
00:03:07,321 --> 00:03:09,449
<i>Hey, I'm back. You still there?</i>

69
00:03:09,473 --> 00:03:11,439
Hi. How's everything going?

70
00:03:11,508 --> 00:03:12,874
It's fine.

71
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:15,743
Uh, not the easiest
patient, but I got his number.

72
00:03:15,813 --> 00:03:17,740
Hey, is he still losing weight?
<i>His appetite's not great.</i>

73
00:03:17,764 --> 00:03:19,676
But that happens. You know that.

74
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,700
Right. And you're sure
you don't need my help?

75
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:23,885
Absolutely not. Go
snuggle your baby.

76
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:25,520
Okay.

77
00:03:25,589 --> 00:03:27,434
Will you let me know if his
albumin drops below 2.5?

78
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:29,357
I'm hanging up. Stop calling me.

79
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,779
Richard Webber.

80
00:03:34,848 --> 00:03:37,766
Seven days status post ex-lap
with pancreatic debridement.

81
00:03:37,835 --> 00:03:40,029
His daily weights
are trending down.

82
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,786
Albumin's low at 2.

83
00:03:41,855 --> 00:03:43,450
OT wants to do a swallow study.

84
00:03:43,474 --> 00:03:46,090
In the meantime, I recommend
starting NG tube feeds.

85
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,526
No.

86
00:03:48,746 --> 00:03:51,145
No tube.

87
00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:55,917
He doesn't seem to want a tube.

88
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:57,618
Respectfully, Dr. Bailey...

89
00:03:59,773 --> 00:04:04,209
Make sure to replete his
electrolytes, and he'll start recovering.

90
00:04:04,278 --> 00:04:06,438
We've already given
him... Give him more.

91
00:04:14,604 --> 00:04:17,973
Where the hell is Shane? He
was supposed to study with us.

92
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:19,457
Mmm, more practice for us.

93
00:04:19,526 --> 00:04:21,275
Jo, hit me. Dude, pants!

94
00:04:21,345 --> 00:04:24,045
Crap. Sorry. I'm
stuck on a question.

95
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:25,275
What's with the underwear?

96
00:04:25,299 --> 00:04:26,476
Totally not work-appropriate.

97
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,167
I'm waiting for Alex
to make a move.

98
00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:31,675
So I'm prepared all the
time. What about grooming?

99
00:04:31,722 --> 00:04:33,466
All the time. That's exhausting.

100
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:35,134
Why don't you just
make the first move?

101
00:04:35,158 --> 00:04:38,126
'Cause I'm not the slut who
just jumps into bed with someone

102
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:40,945
right after her
friend died. Really?

103
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:43,476
Well, I'm not
gonna advertise it.

104
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,100
Trauma in the pit. Gotta go.

105
00:04:45,185 --> 00:04:47,514
It's been a week, and he hasn't
made a move. Is that weird?

106
00:04:47,538 --> 00:04:49,303
Yeah.

107
00:04:57,313 --> 00:04:59,024
Haircut?

108
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:00,648
Yes.

109
00:05:04,454 --> 00:05:05,704
You can't just say "haircut."

110
00:05:05,756 --> 00:05:07,133
You have to say "nice haircut."

111
00:05:07,157 --> 00:05:09,102
Otherwise, I'll think that
you think it's a bad haircut.

112
00:05:09,126 --> 00:05:11,009
And I'm wearing a
dress and I got a haircut

113
00:05:11,077 --> 00:05:12,522
'cause I wanna look
nice today. Do I look nice?

114
00:05:12,546 --> 00:05:13,707
You look tense.

115
00:05:13,731 --> 00:05:15,274
Say I look nice! You look nice.

116
00:05:15,298 --> 00:05:17,199
Was that so hard? Mmm.

117
00:05:17,267 --> 00:05:19,267
Here we are.

118
00:05:20,938 --> 00:05:22,082
Oh, my God.

119
00:05:22,106 --> 00:05:23,504
Why are we here?

120
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:26,958
So you can see it for yourself
so this is not just a concept.

121
00:05:27,027 --> 00:05:29,911
There is a hole in this
hospital, and it is leaking money.

122
00:05:29,979 --> 00:05:31,557
But isn't that what
insurance is for?

123
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:33,065
They are swamped
with storm claims.

124
00:05:33,117 --> 00:05:35,183
Now with this outpatient
surgery wing gone,

125
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:38,136
all of those patients are now
overloading our regular ORs.

126
00:05:38,204 --> 00:05:39,766
Well, what do you
want us to do about it?

127
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:43,007
Meet. Make a plan. Be the board.

128
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:44,442
We're all swamped.

129
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:46,222
And Meredith and Derek
are on leave. Webber's down.

130
00:05:46,246 --> 00:05:48,430
Yeah, and you and Torres
can't be in the same room.

131
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:53,058
I have a patient.

132
00:05:54,388 --> 00:05:55,920
You know, right now

133
00:05:55,989 --> 00:05:58,234
this hospital needs doctors more
than it needs board members.

134
00:05:58,258 --> 00:06:00,192
What this hospital
needs is both.

135
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:04,529
If you people can't be both,
then we are in a lot of trouble.

136
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:12,003
Hey.

137
00:06:18,662 --> 00:06:20,595
I should go. Why?

138
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:25,550
We can't be alone together.

139
00:06:25,619 --> 00:06:27,852
We're just talking about work.

140
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:40,460
Nurses' station. Can I help you?

141
00:06:40,484 --> 00:06:41,484
Ugh!

142
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:43,725
You all right?

143
00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:46,821
Yeah.

144
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:48,134
Nurses' station. Please hold.

145
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:51,226
No. I... No. I
haven't heard yet.

146
00:06:53,897 --> 00:06:55,096
About my boards.

147
00:06:55,431 --> 00:06:56,814
Oh.

148
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:58,416
Yeah.

149
00:06:58,485 --> 00:07:00,130
But don't freak out. You passed.

150
00:07:00,154 --> 00:07:01,503
Well, if I didn't,

151
00:07:01,572 --> 00:07:03,532
you'll know that the first
time wasn't your fault.

152
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:05,540
It was all me.

153
00:07:06,727 --> 00:07:08,760
Don't freak out.

154
00:07:08,829 --> 00:07:10,973
Hey. Hey. You're
riding with me today.

155
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:12,424
Yeah, about that.
Come on, it's a good one.

156
00:07:12,448 --> 00:07:13,993
Coming through!
Oh, what do we got?

157
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:16,050
- Human pincushion.
- Kathleen Kane, 38.

158
00:07:16,119 --> 00:07:17,630
Woman versus
shattered baseball bat.

159
00:07:17,654 --> 00:07:18,854
Puncture wounds to the chest

160
00:07:18,889 --> 00:07:20,316
and what looks like a
distal radius fracture.

161
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,623
BP 85 palp, pressure 135.

162
00:07:22,693 --> 00:07:24,604
The batter was
jammed with a fastball,

163
00:07:24,628 --> 00:07:26,561
and the bat, it just
exploded, you know?

164
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:27,823
My jersey's really messed up.

165
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:28,958
Don't worry about that, baby.

166
00:07:28,982 --> 00:07:30,798
Okay, everybody.
Ready? On my count.

167
00:07:30,868 --> 00:07:32,684
One, two, three.

168
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,087
I'm here. I'm right here, okay?

169
00:07:36,155 --> 00:07:38,172
Somebody paged me?
Possible Colles' fracture.

170
00:07:39,943 --> 00:07:41,637
Uh, sir, I need you to
wait outside, all right?

171
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:43,489
Right now, she needs
you to give us room to work.

172
00:07:43,513 --> 00:07:44,779
We need another nurse in here!

173
00:07:44,848 --> 00:07:47,176
You're gonna make sure
she's all right, right? Kat? Okay?

174
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,978
All right, I'm gonna show
you where you can wait.

175
00:07:49,002 --> 00:07:50,179
Decreased breath
sounds on the right.

176
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:51,597
We need X-ray in here stat!
- Right away.

177
00:07:51,621 --> 00:07:54,706
I'm dizzy. It's dark.

178
00:07:54,758 --> 00:07:56,018
Am I dying? LEAH: No, ma'am.

179
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:57,904
Her systolic's down
to 78. Tell Dante.

180
00:07:57,928 --> 00:08:00,144
You have to tell
Dante. Look at me.

181
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:01,708
If I die... You're not dying.

182
00:08:01,732 --> 00:08:03,243
You need to tell my
husband. Promise me.

183
00:08:03,267 --> 00:08:05,282
Of course. He needs to know.

184
00:08:05,352 --> 00:08:07,435
And tell him...

185
00:08:08,388 --> 00:08:10,655
I will. What is it?

186
00:08:10,724 --> 00:08:12,457
I cheated on him
with his brother.

187
00:08:14,945 --> 00:08:16,344
What?

188
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:19,047
What did she say?

189
00:08:29,376 --> 00:08:30,954
Did you hear what she asked me?

190
00:08:30,978 --> 00:08:32,688
People say crazy things
when they're in shock.

191
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:34,040
- CT ready for us?
- I'll check.

192
00:08:34,064 --> 00:08:35,975
Hey, Kepner, did you
hear back yet, by the way?

193
00:08:35,999 --> 00:08:37,076
No, not yet.

194
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,510
Mmm.

195
00:08:38,534 --> 00:08:39,834
You think that's bad?

196
00:08:39,903 --> 00:08:41,002
You think it's good?

197
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:45,101
So do I have to tell her
husband? Tell him what?

198
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:47,069
She grabbed me
with her bloody claw

199
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:48,571
and said if she dies to tell him

200
00:08:48,595 --> 00:08:50,222
that she slept with his brother.

201
00:08:50,246 --> 00:08:51,279
Whoa.

202
00:08:51,348 --> 00:08:52,764
Bitch.

203
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:53,960
Why would she ask me to do that?

204
00:08:53,984 --> 00:08:55,244
Maybe she wants
a clear conscience.

205
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:57,469
Maybe he cheated first
and trashed the marriage.

206
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,721
Maybe he's an inconsiderate
cheating bastard,

207
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,830
and she wanted
to get the last word.

208
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,103
So, I don't have
to tell him, right?

209
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:05,538
How about you
just don't let her die?

210
00:09:05,562 --> 00:09:07,573
Okay, we can't wait for CT.
We gotta get her into the OR.

211
00:09:07,597 --> 00:09:08,997
We'll put the
chest tube in there.

212
00:09:10,517 --> 00:09:11,900
Uh, sorry.

213
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:14,385
Uh, just confirming I'll
see you tonight at 7:00?

214
00:09:14,454 --> 00:09:16,688
Yeah, I don't think
that's a good idea.

215
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:18,617
Callie, we agreed
to couples' therapy.

216
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:20,708
Yeah, we agreed to
a lot of things. So...

217
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:24,312
Okay, well, I'll be there.

218
00:09:28,001 --> 00:09:31,102
Murphy, make yourself useful
and put a splint on that arm.

219
00:09:33,623 --> 00:09:36,390
He needs an NG tube, Dr. Grey.

220
00:09:36,459 --> 00:09:38,070
I was hoping you could
call Dr. Bailey and...

221
00:09:38,094 --> 00:09:40,362
Dr. Bailey is gonna
kill me if I call her again.

222
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:42,007
<i>Richard is just being stubborn,</i>

223
00:09:42,031 --> 00:09:43,726
<i>and Bailey doesn't
want to call him out.</i>

224
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:44,883
Order the NG tube.

225
00:09:44,952 --> 00:09:46,785
And that way, at
least it will be ready

226
00:09:46,853 --> 00:09:48,603
by the time Bailey
comes to her senses.

227
00:09:48,672 --> 00:09:50,449
But I'm not sure that
she... I have to go.

228
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:55,944
An hour and a
half to go get milk?

229
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:58,012
I think, um,

230
00:09:58,081 --> 00:10:02,567
I might've closed my
eyes in the store parking lot.

231
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:05,737
I really should be studying.

232
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:07,182
Trust me. You are gonna
want to be in on this.

233
00:10:07,206 --> 00:10:09,118
This is the best
part of the job.

234
00:10:09,142 --> 00:10:11,292
Cara. Carlos.

235
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,462
Guys, this is Dr. Edwards.
She'll be assisting today.

236
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,764
And I have the simulation back.

237
00:10:16,832 --> 00:10:18,583
Mmm, show me. Show me.

238
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:20,562
Okay, now first, we're
gonna be removing the scars

239
00:10:20,586 --> 00:10:24,022
using tissue harvested
from your back and scalp.

240
00:10:24,074 --> 00:10:25,585
And then I'm gonna
hide our new scars

241
00:10:25,609 --> 00:10:27,158
right here in the facial planes.

242
00:10:27,226 --> 00:10:29,171
And it's gonna look a
little something like this.

243
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:32,998
Oh, my God.

244
00:10:34,817 --> 00:10:36,100
Really?

245
00:10:36,169 --> 00:10:37,569
You can do that?

246
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,081
You can make me look like that?

247
00:10:39,105 --> 00:10:41,806
Now it's an estimate,
but it is very, very close.

248
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:43,157
And it's free?

249
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:45,926
'Cause our insurance maxed
out about two surgeries ago.

250
00:10:45,995 --> 00:10:48,029
We know. That's
why this one's on us.

251
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:53,084
Hey, Cara.

252
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:55,281
I didn't think I was gonna
get to go back to work.

253
00:10:55,305 --> 00:10:57,104
She teaches kindergarten.

254
00:10:57,173 --> 00:10:58,901
Yeah, she's afraid she's
gonna scare the kids.

255
00:10:58,925 --> 00:11:00,965
And she can't teach without
feeling her best, right?

256
00:11:01,895 --> 00:11:03,228
You guys!

257
00:11:04,347 --> 00:11:06,147
Thank you so much.

258
00:11:07,851 --> 00:11:10,201
You still want to study?

259
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:12,871
She has lost a lot of blood,
but she's stable for now.

260
00:11:12,939 --> 00:11:15,518
We're gonna take her into
surgery and remove the fragments.

261
00:11:15,542 --> 00:11:18,176
Okay. Okay, thanks.

262
00:11:18,245 --> 00:11:21,880
Marcus, she's going
into surgery, man.

263
00:11:21,948 --> 00:11:23,188
Is she gonna be all right?

264
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:25,411
Um... No, it's okay.

265
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:26,595
He's family. He's my brother.

266
00:11:30,757 --> 00:11:32,907
She's, uh...

267
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:35,042
I'm

268
00:11:35,845 --> 00:11:37,462
gonna

269
00:11:37,514 --> 00:11:39,413
see you after.

270
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:42,417
Thanks, man.

271
00:11:42,486 --> 00:11:45,437
In the 17 years since
your infant heart transplant,

272
00:11:45,505 --> 00:11:46,882
your mitral valve
has started to fail.

273
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:49,407
So replacing it would
increase cardiac function.

274
00:11:49,476 --> 00:11:50,970
And he won't need
another transplant.

275
00:11:50,994 --> 00:11:53,122
- That is the hope.
- I gotta ask you again.

276
00:11:53,146 --> 00:11:54,891
Are you sure that
you wanna do this?

277
00:11:54,915 --> 00:11:57,448
There's a high risk
of tearing the ventricle,

278
00:11:57,517 --> 00:11:58,983
bleeding, arrhythmias...

279
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:00,713
You're saying he'd need
a transplant anyway.

280
00:12:00,737 --> 00:12:02,686
I'm saying that he could die.

281
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:05,367
The safest bet is to put Michael
on the list for a new heart.

282
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,125
No.

283
00:12:07,194 --> 00:12:09,293
I understand the risks.
We talked about it.

284
00:12:09,362 --> 00:12:12,196
We almost lost him
waiting for his last heart.

285
00:12:12,265 --> 00:12:13,932
When it was clear he was dying,

286
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,566
I asked the nurse
if I could hold him.

287
00:12:15,635 --> 00:12:17,835
He was so tiny.

288
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:19,820
I spent a whole night

289
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:22,773
looking in his eyes,
telling him I loved him,

290
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:26,678
accepting that I would
never, ever hear his first word.

291
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:29,246
I held my baby while he died.

292
00:12:30,433 --> 00:12:32,884
And then the phone rang.

293
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:36,287
But I almost lost him.

294
00:12:36,355 --> 00:12:38,256
And I cannot go
through that again.

295
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:40,870
The chance that there will be
another donor that matches me,

296
00:12:40,894 --> 00:12:43,745
that I'll live long enough
for us to find that person,

297
00:12:43,813 --> 00:12:45,591
that I'll even get to
the top of the list...

298
00:12:45,615 --> 00:12:47,264
We like these odds better.

299
00:12:48,251 --> 00:12:49,583
Okay.

300
00:12:49,652 --> 00:12:52,753
Well, if your MRI is good,
we'll get started today.

301
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:56,252
That kid should be
on the UNOS list.

302
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:58,120
Well, you heard them,
Alex. They wanna take a shot.

303
00:12:58,144 --> 00:13:00,144
And who are you to say
no to a high-risk surgery?

304
00:13:01,464 --> 00:13:03,709
Let's just see
what his MRI says.

305
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:09,153
Funny thing. I didn't
order an NG tube.

306
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:10,982
Did you hear me order
an NG tube, Dr. Webber?

307
00:13:11,006 --> 00:13:12,234
No. I...

308
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:13,652
So you can imagine our surprise

309
00:13:13,676 --> 00:13:16,894
when a nurse brought one
in, along with a feeding pump.

310
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:19,341
Dr. Webber worried that I had
changed his course of treatment

311
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:20,365
without consulting him.

312
00:13:20,417 --> 00:13:21,560
Dr. Bailey...

313
00:13:21,584 --> 00:13:22,750
I told him I did not.

314
00:13:22,818 --> 00:13:25,453
So then we got to thinking
about who, perhaps,

315
00:13:25,522 --> 00:13:27,338
could have ordered these things,

316
00:13:27,406 --> 00:13:28,840
and your name came up.

317
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:30,458
I was trying to be proactive.

318
00:13:30,527 --> 00:13:32,504
In case repleting his
electrolytes doesn't work...

319
00:13:32,528 --> 00:13:34,362
You wanna be proactive?

320
00:13:37,116 --> 00:13:38,399
Get me some soup.

321
00:13:40,453 --> 00:13:41,819
You heard the man.

322
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:46,407
Hey, what do you mean
"no pro bono surgeries"?

323
00:13:46,476 --> 00:13:48,321
All funds are being reallocated

324
00:13:48,345 --> 00:13:50,339
to storm repair
until further notice.

325
00:13:50,363 --> 00:13:52,130
What? Who said that?

326
00:13:52,199 --> 00:13:54,532
The board did, so, you.

327
00:13:56,135 --> 00:13:57,713
All right, well, my lady's
facial reconstruction surgery

328
00:13:57,737 --> 00:14:00,238
was booked way before the storm.

329
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:01,717
She teaches kindergarten.

330
00:14:01,741 --> 00:14:02,981
Avery, I don't make the rules.

331
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:04,876
I just get to be
the bad cop here.

332
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:07,656
So then I'll just have the board
meet, and they're gonna approve it.

333
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,558
Well, that's gonna be tricky
since everyone on the board

334
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:11,160
has their own pro bonos
that they wanna do.

335
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:13,318
So when you all get
together, maybe come find me

336
00:14:13,386 --> 00:14:16,804
and tell me how you plan to
fund repairing the outpatient OR,

337
00:14:16,872 --> 00:14:18,489
so we're not
drowning in patients.

338
00:14:18,557 --> 00:14:20,736
Come on. We're gonna get
to that when things slow down.

339
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,655
Things won't slow
down until we get to it.

340
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:24,456
Well, if you'd let me finish
my reconstruction surgery...

341
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,909
Avery, we do not have
the money for this surgery.

342
00:14:26,933 --> 00:14:29,083
Listen to me. All due
respect, you said it yourself,

343
00:14:29,152 --> 00:14:30,835
you don't make the rules. I do.

344
00:14:30,904 --> 00:14:33,905
Now Cara McAdams, that pro
bono is not gonna be canceled.

345
00:14:33,974 --> 00:14:36,256
I need you to be a
good cop, a traffic cop.

346
00:14:36,325 --> 00:14:37,386
Uh, I'm sorry?

347
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:38,876
Move some patients around.

348
00:14:38,945 --> 00:14:40,706
If we're overloaded, then
transfer them to Seattle Pres.

349
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:42,010
I don't care. But
make some room.

350
00:14:43,867 --> 00:14:47,185
Yes, sir.

351
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:50,487
<i>So I'm waiting on the kid's
MRI, and if it's too crappy,</i>

352
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,467
I have to put him on the
transplant list and no surgery.

353
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:54,042
So what do you think?

354
00:14:54,127 --> 00:14:58,929
I think he went to the store
and took a nap in the parking lot.

355
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:00,314
Where's my nap, Cristina?

356
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,610
I don't know. I
didn't steal your nap.

357
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:02,916
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

358
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:05,786
It's just my boobs hurt and
they're covered in lanolin

359
00:15:05,855 --> 00:15:07,355
<i>and I smell like an old couch.</i>

360
00:15:07,423 --> 00:15:10,224
Okay. Got eyes on Webber.

361
00:15:10,292 --> 00:15:11,526
No NG tube.

362
00:15:11,611 --> 00:15:13,044
Damn it, Shane.

363
00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:15,145
I almost touched his arm today.

364
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:16,425
<i>Webber's?</i>

365
00:15:16,449 --> 00:15:18,049
No. Owen's.

366
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:20,563
He's so stressed out about the
hospital, and I thought, you know,

367
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:22,587
I'd offer some support
and touch his arm.

368
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:26,991
But, you know, you touch
his arm and then you're in bed,

369
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:29,994
and then, nothing's changed.

370
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,380
Oh, crap. Hold on.

371
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:34,882
I got my valve kid's MRI.

372
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:36,050
Mer?

373
00:15:38,788 --> 00:15:39,820
Mer?

374
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:42,840
Oh, big help.

375
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:49,241
The shower works
better when you're in it.

376
00:15:52,652 --> 00:15:56,053
Oh. He's hungry, and my
nipples are no use to him.

377
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:58,403
I know.

378
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,502
Did you see the look on her face

379
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:02,104
when you showed
her that picture?

380
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:04,240
I just... I wanna see
that look on her new face.

381
00:16:04,264 --> 00:16:05,808
I'm glad Chief Hunt came around.

382
00:16:05,832 --> 00:16:07,910
I made sure he got the message
that I am doing the surgery

383
00:16:07,934 --> 00:16:10,234
whether he likes it or not.

384
00:16:11,171 --> 00:16:12,937
Where is Mrs. McAdams?

385
00:16:13,006 --> 00:16:15,356
She was moved out by Chief Hunt.

386
00:16:17,493 --> 00:16:19,827
I don't think he
got the message.

387
00:16:21,547 --> 00:16:23,981
Owen, why do you keep
rescheduling my surgeries?

388
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:25,861
Well, let's have a board
meeting, and I'll tell you.

389
00:16:25,885 --> 00:16:26,963
Why can't you tell me right now?

390
00:16:26,987 --> 00:16:29,187
Because I'm busy
rescheduling surgeries.

391
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:30,749
Why? ARIZONA: Owen?

392
00:16:30,773 --> 00:16:32,918
What's this about a purchasing
freeze on the NICU budget?

393
00:16:32,942 --> 00:16:35,382
Good. I have two of you here,
at least, so maybe we could...

394
00:16:35,412 --> 00:16:36,855
Okay. Hey.

395
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:39,308
We're not buying the babies'
jewelry. We're buying them medicine.

396
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:42,011
Right now, we're low on NICU
blankets. That's baby blankets.

397
00:16:42,035 --> 00:16:43,800
Don't tell me. Tell the board!

398
00:16:43,869 --> 00:16:46,219
Hunt, where did my pro bono go?

399
00:16:46,288 --> 00:16:48,383
Well, I took your
advice about transfers,

400
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:50,569
so I found someone at
Seattle Pres who could do it.

401
00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:52,209
That is my patient.

402
00:16:52,278 --> 00:16:53,856
Not anymore.
Your patient is, uh...

403
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,848
Let's see. A gluteal liposuction,
with two lipos after that.

404
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:58,944
You can't just fill my day
with... Of course, I can.

405
00:16:58,968 --> 00:17:00,434
It's what a traffic cop does.

406
00:17:02,338 --> 00:17:03,671
Gluteal lipo. So that's...

407
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:05,489
Sucking butt fat.

408
00:17:05,558 --> 00:17:07,325
Is that part of the logo?

409
00:17:07,393 --> 00:17:09,004
It's gotta be the
source of all this blood.

410
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,411
Nope. There's blood coming

411
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,828
from somewhere else superiorly.

412
00:17:11,898 --> 00:17:13,508
We're gonna have
to extend this incision.

413
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:15,092
Scalpel? MAN: Scalpel.

414
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:19,364
So I don't have
to tell Dante, right?

415
00:17:19,388 --> 00:17:21,166
I mean, I can just forget
that she said it. Murphy.

416
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:23,819
'Cause the brother's here now,
and it'll just ignite a family feud.

417
00:17:23,843 --> 00:17:25,593
And maybe I heard her wrong.

418
00:17:25,661 --> 00:17:26,872
What else sounds like brother?

419
00:17:26,896 --> 00:17:28,028
Mother?

420
00:17:28,114 --> 00:17:30,175
Oh, God. She's gonna live, okay?

421
00:17:30,199 --> 00:17:32,700
No. I know.

422
00:17:34,704 --> 00:17:36,515
It's just, there's a big bleeder
that we haven't found yet.

423
00:17:36,539 --> 00:17:37,905
Murphy!

424
00:18:03,883 --> 00:18:05,683
Are you gonna watch me eat?

425
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:08,502
No. Absolutely not.

426
00:18:51,431 --> 00:18:52,463
Hey.

427
00:18:53,265 --> 00:18:54,648
Hey.

428
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:57,818
What are you doin'? Scavenging.
NICU's low on blankets.

429
00:18:57,887 --> 00:18:59,186
What are you doin'?

430
00:18:59,254 --> 00:19:01,494
I have a painful erection
that won't subside.

431
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:04,792
Oh, not me. Pfft. Uh, cards.

432
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:07,995
Huh. Oh. My
condition is priapism.

433
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:10,580
Major causes are sickle cell

434
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:12,365
and...

435
00:19:12,435 --> 00:19:14,718
Crap. Leukemia.

436
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:16,136
I hope it goes away soon.

437
00:19:16,205 --> 00:19:17,321
Mmm.

438
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,090
Hey, uh, you know,

439
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,610
you can kick my
friends out if you want to.

440
00:19:22,678 --> 00:19:25,891
I mean, it's your house. They
shouldn't be there all the time.

441
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:29,583
No. Hey, uh, your
friend died a week ago.

442
00:19:29,652 --> 00:19:32,486
You guys should
hang out or whatever.

443
00:19:33,206 --> 00:19:34,571
Yeah.

444
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,090
Unless you're over it already.

445
00:19:36,158 --> 00:19:39,827
No. I mean, I'm still
really sad, of course.

446
00:19:39,895 --> 00:19:41,361
But, uh, um...

447
00:19:41,431 --> 00:19:43,898
Look, I get it.

448
00:19:43,967 --> 00:19:47,000
I mean, they can crash
however long they want.

449
00:19:48,404 --> 00:19:50,404
You're being really
great about this.

450
00:19:50,756 --> 00:19:52,990
Really, really great.

451
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:01,059
Ugh.

452
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:11,292
Your mitral valve replacement?

453
00:20:11,361 --> 00:20:14,641
Yeah. A 17-year-old infant
heart transplant recipient.

454
00:20:16,398 --> 00:20:17,776
Karev doesn't
think I should do it.

455
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,968
His EF's only
25%. Yeah, it sucks.

456
00:20:21,037 --> 00:20:23,432
And there is a lot of
scarring to get through.

457
00:20:23,456 --> 00:20:25,222
Karev is right.

458
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:27,469
This kid should go straight
on the transplant list.

459
00:20:28,595 --> 00:20:30,494
It's risky,

460
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:32,512
but the parents want
it, and so does the kid.

461
00:20:34,783 --> 00:20:36,623
Sounds like you're
gonna go ahead then.

462
00:20:37,336 --> 00:20:38,368
Yeah.

463
00:20:39,672 --> 00:20:40,912
Well, good luck.

464
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:43,574
Thanks.

465
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:48,929
What?

466
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:52,266
Normally, I'd kiss you.

467
00:20:54,187 --> 00:20:56,468
I'd wish you luck
and then I'd kiss you.

468
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:00,535
Hey, you guys did
couples' therapy, right?

469
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,093
Was it good? Did it help?

470
00:21:02,161 --> 00:21:04,056
I mean, obviously not,
right? Look at you guys.

471
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,146
Uh, no offense. Offense.

472
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:08,656
Well...

473
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:14,187
Torres.

474
00:21:14,256 --> 00:21:16,289
What?

475
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:19,192
The only way? No, no, no.
No, you don't cut the clavicle!

476
00:21:19,261 --> 00:21:21,478
No, don't do that without
me! Why would you do that?

477
00:21:21,547 --> 00:21:22,908
Because the subclavian's
bleeding like stink,

478
00:21:22,932 --> 00:21:24,542
and we can't get to
it. She's bleeding out!

479
00:21:24,566 --> 00:21:26,066
And she's bleeding out.

480
00:21:26,135 --> 00:21:28,285
Ugh.

481
00:21:28,354 --> 00:21:30,215
Okay, everybody out. - What?

482
00:21:30,239 --> 00:21:32,134
Everybody out. Get out now!
Now! WOMAN: Why? What?

483
00:21:32,158 --> 00:21:34,942
Come on, get out! Come
on! Get out! Come on!

484
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:37,556
You do not cut a
clavicle yourselves!

485
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:39,346
No! No!

486
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:43,244
She says "no." I don't
think I have a choice.

487
00:21:43,268 --> 00:21:45,180
<i>She doesn't have...</i> I can
hear her! Tell her I'm on my way!

488
00:21:45,204 --> 00:21:46,882
<i>She's on her way.</i> Excuse me!

489
00:21:49,842 --> 00:21:51,002
What do we do?

490
00:21:51,026 --> 00:21:52,459
BP's dropping.

491
00:21:52,528 --> 00:21:54,448
- Give me the saw.
- Here you go.

492
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:05,689
Oh, God.

493
00:22:05,758 --> 00:22:07,224
What the hell did you just do?

494
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:12,908
What part of "don't cut the
clavicle" do you not understand?

495
00:22:12,932 --> 00:22:14,760
I fixed it. Massive bleeder
just under the right...

496
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:16,533
You made a clean
cut down the middle.

497
00:22:16,586 --> 00:22:18,097
Do you have any
idea how difficult it is

498
00:22:18,121 --> 00:22:19,848
to repair bone with
this little surface area?

499
00:22:19,872 --> 00:22:22,389
There was no way to do
the repair without visibility.

500
00:22:22,458 --> 00:22:24,224
Mmm, no, there was no easy way.

501
00:22:24,293 --> 00:22:25,937
And because you're
careless and thoughtless,

502
00:22:25,961 --> 00:22:27,561
that seemed prohibitive to you.

503
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:29,407
You think you can just do
whatever you feel like in the moment,

504
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:31,376
and Ortho will just put everything
back the way it's supposed to be.

505
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,080
She was dying! Just go.
Let me clean up your mess.

506
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:36,704
Come on.

507
00:22:39,475 --> 00:22:41,987
Promise me if it looks too
gnarly you'll just close him up.

508
00:22:42,011 --> 00:22:44,377
Will you stop
wringing your hands?

509
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:45,879
God. No wonder
you can't have sex.

510
00:22:45,948 --> 00:22:47,297
I can have sex.

511
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,969
I can have sex.

512
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:57,074
Are the hydraulics not
working? I can write you a script.

513
00:22:57,143 --> 00:22:58,475
Look, that's not...

514
00:22:58,544 --> 00:23:00,844
She's just bummed
about her dead friend

515
00:23:00,913 --> 00:23:02,513
and stressed about her exams.

516
00:23:02,582 --> 00:23:04,281
Ugh, those are not valid.

517
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:06,445
All right. There's been
a lot of girls since Izzie.

518
00:23:06,469 --> 00:23:09,069
A lot of nobodies. But
this girl is not a nobody.

519
00:23:09,138 --> 00:23:11,399
She's... I don't know.
When I think about it,

520
00:23:11,423 --> 00:23:13,135
it just seems important. Like...

521
00:23:13,159 --> 00:23:15,519
Like it's gotta
be the right time.

522
00:23:16,795 --> 00:23:18,012
You want it to be special.

523
00:23:18,097 --> 00:23:20,781
What? Nothing. It's sweet.

524
00:23:20,849 --> 00:23:22,089
Are you making fun of me?

525
00:23:22,134 --> 00:23:23,250
I am not.

526
00:23:26,489 --> 00:23:28,739
Can I ask you one thing?
When we're done here,

527
00:23:29,624 --> 00:23:31,041
will you braid my hair?

528
00:23:35,931 --> 00:23:37,447
Oh, boy.

529
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:39,733
Mmm.

530
00:23:39,801 --> 00:23:41,368
Last chance to turn back.

531
00:23:43,572 --> 00:23:44,671
Scissors.

532
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:45,980
Here you go.

533
00:23:48,161 --> 00:23:49,610
Of course I pissed him off.

534
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:52,257
But transferring my patient to
some other hospital just to spite me?

535
00:23:52,281 --> 00:23:53,747
Seems extreme.

536
00:23:53,816 --> 00:23:55,376
Yeah, he can't do it. Yeah,
he can. He's your boss.

537
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,780
No. I'm his boss. Right?
The board is his boss.

538
00:23:57,804 --> 00:23:58,952
That's a jacked up system.

539
00:23:59,021 --> 00:24:00,670
The system is actually fine.

540
00:24:00,739 --> 00:24:02,117
It's just in this particular
situation, it becomes...

541
00:24:02,141 --> 00:24:03,821
Jacked up? Complicated.

542
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:07,494
You know what's not
complicated? This.

543
00:24:07,563 --> 00:24:09,991
Unless I'm missing something,
you just suck the fat with that hose.

544
00:24:10,015 --> 00:24:11,381
Well, pretty much.

545
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,700
Okay. And the next
lipo will be just like this?

546
00:24:13,769 --> 00:24:15,397
Oh, it's gonna be a
different butt entirely.

547
00:24:15,421 --> 00:24:17,098
Do you really need me here?
'Cause everyone else is studying.

548
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:18,884
You said something
about being with me all day.

549
00:24:18,908 --> 00:24:20,518
Thought we were changing lives?

550
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:23,944
Yeah, but I also wanted to see
the look on our patient's face.

551
00:24:26,865 --> 00:24:28,785
Get out of here. Thanks!

552
00:24:31,486 --> 00:24:33,120
Is he asleep?

553
00:24:33,188 --> 00:24:34,821
No. He hates sleep.

554
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,656
He's staring at the mobile.

555
00:24:38,027 --> 00:24:40,060
Mmm.

556
00:24:40,128 --> 00:24:45,015
I don't know how such a little
kid can puke on so many things.

557
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:46,550
I don't know.

558
00:24:49,038 --> 00:24:50,182
Are you asleep? No.

559
00:24:50,206 --> 00:24:51,738
Nobody's asleep. Are you asleep?

560
00:24:51,807 --> 00:24:54,102
No, I'm too worried
about Richard to sleep.

561
00:24:54,126 --> 00:24:56,643
He needs an NG tube, and
of course he doesn't want one.

562
00:24:56,711 --> 00:24:59,479
And he's intimidating
Bailey into not ordering one.

563
00:24:59,548 --> 00:25:02,149
But that's what he needs.

564
00:25:02,217 --> 00:25:05,419
He made me his family,
and then I abandoned him.

565
00:25:06,355 --> 00:25:08,088
It's just a mess over there.

566
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:20,300
Swallow study?

567
00:25:20,369 --> 00:25:23,489
Okay, Ross, I can't
read this. Take this.

568
00:25:23,722 --> 00:25:25,855
Ross. I know.

569
00:25:25,924 --> 00:25:27,457
He's got a PAS score of six?

570
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:28,942
I know.

571
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:31,745
Okay, I'm a 60-year-old woman

572
00:25:31,814 --> 00:25:34,380
with abdominal pain, a fever,
and significant discharge.

573
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:36,890
My initial diagnosis
is that you're gross.

574
00:25:36,919 --> 00:25:39,447
You guys have gotta go.
No study hall at Alex's tonight.

575
00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:41,088
But it's our spot.
We're study buddies.

576
00:25:41,156 --> 00:25:43,840
No, you are a freaking
human chastity belt.

577
00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:46,087
I know we've been
grieving, but it's been a week.

578
00:25:46,111 --> 00:25:47,351
I am all grieved out.

579
00:25:47,413 --> 00:25:49,713
Ooh, celibacy's made you mean.

580
00:25:49,782 --> 00:25:52,383
Heather would understand.
She'd want me to get laid.

581
00:25:52,451 --> 00:25:53,917
Pushing it, but okay.

582
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:57,871
Okay, look, this is my last
pair of clean, sexy underwear.

583
00:25:57,957 --> 00:25:59,751
Then it's all granny
panties until laundry day.

584
00:25:59,775 --> 00:26:01,655
It has to be tonight.

585
00:26:03,162 --> 00:26:04,611
Oh, no, no, no!

586
00:26:06,615 --> 00:26:08,665
What happened?

587
00:26:08,734 --> 00:26:10,829
I think she stroked
out. Push high dose Epi.

588
00:26:10,853 --> 00:26:12,064
I already pushed high dose Epi.

589
00:26:12,088 --> 00:26:13,220
Did you try Vasopressin?

590
00:26:13,305 --> 00:26:15,417
Kepner, she's been
down for 15 minutes.

591
00:26:15,441 --> 00:26:16,535
What?

592
00:26:19,445 --> 00:26:20,571
No.

593
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:32,873
Time of death, 16:17.

594
00:26:32,942 --> 00:26:35,008
Oh, dear God.

595
00:26:35,077 --> 00:26:37,117
I'm sorry. I tried.

596
00:26:43,068 --> 00:26:44,401
So, um...

597
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:46,920
What do I tell the husband?

598
00:26:49,909 --> 00:26:51,976
You tell him,

599
00:26:52,044 --> 00:26:53,644
we did everything we could,

600
00:26:53,713 --> 00:26:56,041
but despite our best efforts, we...
- Not that part.

601
00:26:56,065 --> 00:26:58,982
The part about how
she slept with his brother.

602
00:26:59,051 --> 00:27:01,479
He's about to hear that his
wife is dead. I think that's enough.

603
00:27:01,503 --> 00:27:03,070
Hang on.

604
00:27:03,138 --> 00:27:05,266
The woman trusted you, Murphy.
She wanted him to know the truth.

605
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:06,757
It's his last
memory of his wife.

606
00:27:06,825 --> 00:27:09,203
Yeah, well, at least
it'll be an honest one.

607
00:27:09,227 --> 00:27:11,144
He deserves to know.

608
00:27:11,213 --> 00:27:12,912
And you made a promise.

609
00:27:12,998 --> 00:27:16,158
You're gonna tell him, and
I'm gonna make sure you do.

610
00:27:31,583 --> 00:27:33,450
What were you thinking?

611
00:27:39,959 --> 00:27:41,759
Hey, what in God's name?

612
00:27:41,827 --> 00:27:43,471
Ross showed me Richard's chart.

613
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:44,978
But you have
staples in your body!

614
00:27:45,047 --> 00:27:47,542
I took them out. I'm a skilled
surgeon. You have no pain?

615
00:27:47,566 --> 00:27:49,783
I have a lot of pain. It's
called sleep deprivation.

616
00:27:49,852 --> 00:27:51,134
Richard is starving.

617
00:27:51,203 --> 00:27:52,669
We have a plan.

618
00:27:52,738 --> 00:27:54,520
"We have a plan?" Yeah.

619
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:56,584
He's a patient here. He
doesn't get to make decisions.

620
00:27:56,608 --> 00:28:00,860
No. We do. We who are
here. We who have the plan.

621
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:02,312
So why don't you go back home...

622
00:28:02,381 --> 00:28:03,664
I will once I know he's okay.

623
00:28:03,749 --> 00:28:05,481
He's not okay.

624
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:08,146
And it isn't as simple as sticking
a feeding tube down his throat.

625
00:28:08,170 --> 00:28:09,669
It is that simple.

626
00:28:09,738 --> 00:28:11,683
We all know he can't
get well unless he eats,

627
00:28:11,707 --> 00:28:13,751
and he can't eat
if he can't swallow.

628
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:15,286
You know as well as I do that

629
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:18,312
a feeding tube is
psychologically devastating.

630
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:19,830
It takes away a man's dignity.

631
00:28:19,899 --> 00:28:21,865
So does dying.

632
00:28:21,933 --> 00:28:24,462
I really wanna talk to the
radiologist about the swallow study.

633
00:28:24,486 --> 00:28:26,786
Well, fine. Let's go. Okay.

634
00:28:26,855 --> 00:28:27,921
What's in your hair?

635
00:28:27,989 --> 00:28:29,069
Baby vomit.

636
00:28:30,492 --> 00:28:33,059
Give me the damn stroller.

637
00:28:55,417 --> 00:28:58,084
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

638
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:01,321
You have dysphagia
and laryngeal edema.

639
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:03,941
Even if you could eat on
your own, which you can't,

640
00:29:04,009 --> 00:29:06,643
you're at risk for
aspirating your food.

641
00:29:06,711 --> 00:29:10,013
You need an NG tube,
or you're gonna starve.

642
00:29:10,082 --> 00:29:12,566
And I'm not gonna let
another one of us die.

643
00:29:14,436 --> 00:29:15,676
You're an intern.

644
00:29:16,989 --> 00:29:19,622
Don't talk to me like I don't
know what's happening.

645
00:29:19,691 --> 00:29:22,425
You're pretending
like it isn't happening,

646
00:29:22,494 --> 00:29:23,877
and Dr. Bailey's letting you.

647
00:29:25,247 --> 00:29:26,880
Dr. Grey is here.

648
00:29:26,949 --> 00:29:28,966
She came all this
way with a baby,

649
00:29:29,034 --> 00:29:30,245
and there's no way
she's gonna leave

650
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:32,202
without forcing this
thing through your nose

651
00:29:32,271 --> 00:29:34,153
and into your stomach.

652
00:29:34,222 --> 00:29:36,974
And I think you don't want
her to be the one to do that.

653
00:29:37,042 --> 00:29:39,142
I'm offering to take
care of this right now.

654
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:42,112
Just you and me.

655
00:29:49,989 --> 00:29:51,233
Avery, I have one
more patient for you.

656
00:29:51,257 --> 00:29:52,433
No, no, no. No more.

657
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:53,668
And I'm calling Cara
McAdams first thing

658
00:29:53,692 --> 00:29:54,969
and I'm doing the
pro bono surgery,

659
00:29:54,993 --> 00:29:56,554
and the board is gonna
discuss your behavior.

660
00:29:56,578 --> 00:29:57,818
Avery, Avery, look.

661
00:29:59,264 --> 00:30:02,282
She's all set for you
first thing tomorrow.

662
00:30:02,351 --> 00:30:04,195
You said you transferred
her. Mmm-hmm. I lied.

663
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:05,746
You lied? Yeah,
I just moved her.

664
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:07,371
So that means you decided that

665
00:30:07,439 --> 00:30:09,451
three liposuctions were more
important than this lady's facial...

666
00:30:09,475 --> 00:30:11,570
No, but the three lipos will pay

667
00:30:11,594 --> 00:30:13,755
for this lady's facial
reconstruction.

668
00:30:13,779 --> 00:30:16,329
The money has to
come from somewhere.

669
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:19,277
So, yeah, I lied, and
now you have the money.

670
00:30:19,301 --> 00:30:22,769
Avery, I needed to
make a point with you.

671
00:30:22,838 --> 00:30:24,583
I know we're all doctors,
and we're all busy,

672
00:30:24,607 --> 00:30:26,940
but until the board
members are willing to solve

673
00:30:27,009 --> 00:30:29,843
the bigger budget problems
caused by the storm,

674
00:30:29,912 --> 00:30:31,690
the doctors' problems
aren't going away.

675
00:30:31,714 --> 00:30:35,499
So you need to do something now.

676
00:30:38,453 --> 00:30:40,332
You are right. Yeah.

677
00:30:40,356 --> 00:30:42,667
You all need to meet.
I can't force you to...

678
00:30:42,691 --> 00:30:43,691
No, no. You can.

679
00:30:45,044 --> 00:30:47,661
You're our boss,
and you can lie.

680
00:30:49,664 --> 00:30:51,609
He's in V-tach, Yang.
You should stop.

681
00:30:51,633 --> 00:30:55,869
They've all been short runs and
then they've all stopped. It's fine.

682
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:57,954
You gotta get over
this "special" thing.

683
00:30:58,023 --> 00:30:59,523
Just throw her
over your shoulder,

684
00:30:59,591 --> 00:31:01,058
take her to bed, and go to town.

685
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:02,237
Every girl's dream.

686
00:31:02,261 --> 00:31:04,861
She's the thing that's
special, dumbass.

687
00:31:07,081 --> 00:31:09,349
God, you have the
right person right there.

688
00:31:09,418 --> 00:31:11,001
You both want the same thing.

689
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:12,714
Wait. Don't...
Don't go too deep.

690
00:31:12,738 --> 00:31:14,521
Stop being scared.

691
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:17,407
This family is not scared.
This boy is not scared.

692
00:31:17,475 --> 00:31:19,243
I am not doing this
because I want to.

693
00:31:19,311 --> 00:31:22,362
I'm doing this because they
asked me to and because I can.

694
00:31:28,086 --> 00:31:30,153
Well? What are you waiting for?

695
00:31:30,222 --> 00:31:31,672
The arrhythmias
are coming closer.

696
00:31:31,757 --> 00:31:33,873
If I keep pushing, I'll
send him into V-fib.

697
00:31:33,942 --> 00:31:37,844
Even cannulating will destroy
the heart before I get to the valve.

698
00:31:37,912 --> 00:31:41,381
You win. This kid
needs a new heart.

699
00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:43,327
Let's get out of here.

700
00:31:43,351 --> 00:31:44,618
I'm sorry.

701
00:31:44,687 --> 00:31:45,919
So am I.

702
00:31:47,756 --> 00:31:50,501
<i>Dr. Ryan to Imaging.
Dr. Ryan to Imaging.</i>

703
00:31:50,525 --> 00:31:52,492
You okay?

704
00:31:52,561 --> 00:31:54,460
Just lost a patient,

705
00:31:54,529 --> 00:31:57,463
and now I am waiting
for more bad news.

706
00:31:57,532 --> 00:32:00,016
Still haven't heard?

707
00:32:00,085 --> 00:32:01,763
You know, when
I failed last year,

708
00:32:01,787 --> 00:32:03,397
I found out before I
got home that night.

709
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:05,689
It's been 48 hours, and nothing.

710
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:08,308
I think if you fail twice,

711
00:32:08,377 --> 00:32:09,954
they just stop talking to you
and hope you get the hint.

712
00:32:09,978 --> 00:32:12,858
I'm pretty sure that's
not how it works.

713
00:32:14,633 --> 00:32:17,250
It's them. It's here.

714
00:32:17,319 --> 00:32:18,518
Go ahead.

715
00:32:20,588 --> 00:32:21,788
Uh...

716
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:25,475
Me? I'm... No. I don't...

717
00:32:25,544 --> 00:32:27,377
Please? I can't.

718
00:32:36,988 --> 00:32:38,988
What?

719
00:32:39,591 --> 00:32:40,840
Just...

720
00:32:40,909 --> 00:32:41,942
Congratulations.

721
00:32:43,261 --> 00:32:45,228
Yes! Yes! Yes.

722
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,646
Yes!

723
00:32:46,714 --> 00:32:50,183
Oh! Thank you, God! Thank you!

724
00:32:50,252 --> 00:32:51,362
Yes!

725
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:52,386
Like you said,

726
00:32:54,456 --> 00:32:55,505
it's all you.

727
00:32:59,311 --> 00:33:00,544
Congratulations.

728
00:33:01,547 --> 00:33:02,828
Thank you.

729
00:33:03,432 --> 00:33:04,697
Yeah.

730
00:33:13,609 --> 00:33:16,843
Your wife had a
stroke during surgery.

731
00:33:16,912 --> 00:33:18,862
She had a coagulation disorder,

732
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:20,780
which is why the
clot formed so quickly.

733
00:33:22,418 --> 00:33:25,051
We're so, so
sorry for your loss.

734
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,803
She was just here.

735
00:33:26,872 --> 00:33:29,050
She was laughing on the
way here. She wanted me...

736
00:33:29,074 --> 00:33:31,474
She wanted me to find
out who won the game.

737
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:43,753
There is one other
thing I need to tell you.

738
00:33:45,491 --> 00:33:47,424
Before she went into surgery,

739
00:33:47,493 --> 00:33:49,292
your wife wanted
me to tell you...

740
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:51,127
That she loves you.

741
00:33:56,685 --> 00:33:59,119
She told us to tell
you that she loves you.

742
00:34:03,592 --> 00:34:05,312
Thank you.

743
00:34:10,765 --> 00:34:12,431
Nurses' station.

744
00:34:12,501 --> 00:34:13,716
Shepherd?

745
00:34:13,785 --> 00:34:15,368
Oh, have you seen
my wife and baby?

746
00:34:15,437 --> 00:34:16,597
Wait. Meredith's here?

747
00:34:16,621 --> 00:34:17,671
Meredith.

748
00:34:17,739 --> 00:34:19,522
Crap. I meant to text you.

749
00:34:19,591 --> 00:34:21,273
I woke up to nothing and nobody.

750
00:34:21,342 --> 00:34:23,955
The woman's wearing mismatched
shoes. Cut her some slack.

751
00:34:23,979 --> 00:34:25,440
I have to go check on Richard.

752
00:34:25,464 --> 00:34:27,113
Send me a note next time.

753
00:34:27,799 --> 00:34:29,349
You look like hell.

754
00:34:29,417 --> 00:34:31,735
You know you're in
a building full of beds.

755
00:34:31,803 --> 00:34:33,181
I just need to go lie down.

756
00:34:33,205 --> 00:34:34,220
Yeah.

757
00:34:43,448 --> 00:34:46,083
Ross, what did you do?

758
00:34:46,151 --> 00:34:47,945
You were supposed
to wait until...

759
00:34:47,969 --> 00:34:51,304
He was overdue for the tube,
and nobody seemed to wanna do it.

760
00:34:51,373 --> 00:34:53,773
He was starving to
death right in front of us,

761
00:34:53,842 --> 00:34:55,241
so I did what had to be done.

762
00:35:03,268 --> 00:35:04,845
There was so much scar tissue.

763
00:35:04,869 --> 00:35:08,004
I'm afraid I couldn't get
to the valve to repair it.

764
00:35:08,073 --> 00:35:10,273
Michael has to go
on the transplant list.

765
00:35:10,342 --> 00:35:13,726
The transplant coordinator will
be in to ask you some questions.

766
00:35:13,795 --> 00:35:15,295
Oh, God.

767
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:18,197
Look, the transplant list
is not a death sentence.

768
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:21,551
It's a chance. It's hope
that most people never get.

769
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:24,615
When Michael wakes up, he
needs to hear that from you.

770
00:35:24,639 --> 00:35:26,817
I know it's not what you wanted,

771
00:35:26,841 --> 00:35:28,986
but now we have to move forward.

772
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:32,679
Michael needs the hope that there
is a donor out there somewhere,

773
00:35:32,747 --> 00:35:34,030
or he won't survive.

774
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:44,174
You're up?

775
00:35:44,242 --> 00:35:46,142
Barely. I got paged. Me, too.

776
00:35:46,211 --> 00:35:48,556
Well, who would page us? We're
not even supposed to be here.

777
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:50,841
I was having the nicest dream.
Wait. You guys got a page?

778
00:35:50,865 --> 00:35:52,331
God, what happened to the guy?

779
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,850
Apparently everything.

780
00:35:53,918 --> 00:35:55,051
Hey, you were paged, too?

781
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:56,386
Why outpatient surgery?

782
00:35:56,455 --> 00:35:58,755
Well, it's a disaster area.
Maybe someone got hurt.

783
00:36:00,174 --> 00:36:01,654
I don't know.

784
00:36:05,964 --> 00:36:07,213
It worked.

785
00:36:07,282 --> 00:36:09,399
I cannot believe
that that worked.

786
00:36:09,468 --> 00:36:11,317
Uh, okay. Where's the trauma?

787
00:36:11,386 --> 00:36:13,197
There's no trauma. This
is a meeting of the board.

788
00:36:13,221 --> 00:36:14,915
There's no trauma?
A meeting about what?

789
00:36:14,939 --> 00:36:16,489
We're gonna have a party.

790
00:36:16,557 --> 00:36:18,135
Is this a trauma, a
meeting or a party?

791
00:36:18,159 --> 00:36:20,092
I'm so confused. I'm so tired.

792
00:36:20,161 --> 00:36:23,179
We're gonna have a party,
folks. A big one. Gala fund-raiser.

793
00:36:23,248 --> 00:36:25,109
We're gonna invite the
richest people that we know,

794
00:36:25,133 --> 00:36:26,861
and we are gonna charm
the money out of them.

795
00:36:26,885 --> 00:36:28,596
But first, Dr. Hunt
is gonna tell us

796
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:31,649
exactly how much money we
need and where it needs to go,

797
00:36:31,673 --> 00:36:34,024
starting with what
used to be this room.

798
00:36:34,092 --> 00:36:37,093
So, let's settle in. This
is gonna take a while.

799
00:36:55,530 --> 00:36:57,675
We have the house to ourselves.

800
00:36:57,699 --> 00:36:59,031
But I want you to know that

801
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:00,344
just because I'm about
to jump into bed with you

802
00:37:00,368 --> 00:37:02,452
does not mean
I'm an unfeeling slut

803
00:37:02,521 --> 00:37:04,754
who isn't sad about
Heather, because I am sad.

804
00:37:04,822 --> 00:37:06,918
I'm also very, very...
No more talking.

805
00:37:06,942 --> 00:37:09,525
What? Oh!

806
00:37:09,594 --> 00:37:11,694
Yes! Oh, thank God!

807
00:37:30,048 --> 00:37:31,848
Eventually, I'm
gonna touch your arm,

808
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:35,118
and you are going to kiss
me good luck before surgery.

809
00:37:35,754 --> 00:37:37,887
Cristina.

810
00:37:37,956 --> 00:37:40,874
Let's date other people.

811
00:37:40,942 --> 00:37:46,696
Okay, it'll suck and it'll feel
forced, but maybe it'll help.

812
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:48,798
Maybe eventually I won't
want to take your hand

813
00:37:48,866 --> 00:37:50,611
when we get off the
elevator at the end of the day.

814
00:37:50,635 --> 00:37:52,355
No, come on. Don't.

815
00:37:57,041 --> 00:37:58,624
Just tell me you'll try.

816
00:38:18,046 --> 00:38:19,512
I'll try.

817
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:21,864
Okay.

818
00:38:37,165 --> 00:38:40,066
Oh! Thank God. You came.

819
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:48,558
I've been wishing
you hadn't told me,

820
00:38:48,626 --> 00:38:51,126
and that we could
go back to our life,

821
00:38:52,297 --> 00:38:54,197
to being happy.

822
00:38:56,067 --> 00:38:59,736
Except we weren't happy.

823
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,788
At least you weren't.

824
00:39:02,857 --> 00:39:06,008
And so we do things like
have sex with other people.

825
00:39:06,077 --> 00:39:07,760
Callie, I made a mistake.

826
00:39:09,164 --> 00:39:12,348
One mistake... Yeah, I
don't think it was a mistake.

827
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:18,838
I've been picturing you
screwing that woman

828
00:39:18,906 --> 00:39:21,146
over and over
again. And I can't...

829
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:23,054
Think about her or
talk about her anymore.

830
00:39:23,078 --> 00:39:25,578
I'm all done with
that for right now.

831
00:39:25,647 --> 00:39:28,087
So I'm not going into that room.

832
00:39:30,919 --> 00:39:32,159
But I think you should.

833
00:39:34,172 --> 00:39:36,573
I think you need to.

834
00:39:36,641 --> 00:39:41,060
<i>In the game of mercy,
when one kid cries out...</i>

835
00:39:41,129 --> 00:39:42,545
No.

836
00:39:42,614 --> 00:39:45,714
<i>The other one listens,
and the pain stops.</i>

837
00:39:45,783 --> 00:39:46,783
Please.

838
00:39:47,953 --> 00:39:49,852
I really need to talk.

839
00:39:51,673 --> 00:39:54,740
I really need you to do this.

840
00:39:58,597 --> 00:40:01,130
I know.

841
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:03,480
You wore the red
dress and everything.

842
00:40:12,977 --> 00:40:15,311
<i>Don't you wish it
was that easy now?</i>

843
00:40:33,965 --> 00:40:36,715
I'm sorry. I know I
haven't been here.

844
00:40:38,053 --> 00:40:39,886
You picked me as your family...

845
00:40:39,955 --> 00:40:41,687
Stop it. Stop it.

846
00:40:43,959 --> 00:40:47,042
I didn't call you my family.

847
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:49,211
I'm not your father.

848
00:40:49,281 --> 00:40:53,099
I chose you because I thought
you could put emotion aside,

849
00:40:54,736 --> 00:40:57,103
and make the right call.

850
00:40:58,106 --> 00:41:00,439
I knew Bailey was too weak.

851
00:41:01,693 --> 00:41:03,359
But you,

852
00:41:04,763 --> 00:41:06,763
I thought I could trust

853
00:41:09,067 --> 00:41:12,802
not to let them operate
on me when I was all but...

854
00:41:15,756 --> 00:41:17,957
When I was all but dead.

855
00:41:20,962 --> 00:41:23,462
Not to bring me back to

856
00:41:23,998 --> 00:41:25,331
life,

857
00:41:27,535 --> 00:41:30,186
where I have to get my

858
00:41:30,254 --> 00:41:32,254
meals from a...

859
00:41:34,125 --> 00:41:36,842
From a tube.

860
00:41:36,912 --> 00:41:39,612
I thought you wouldn't
be sentimental.

861
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,066
I was wrong.

862
00:41:50,959 --> 00:41:54,209
I chose the wrong person.

863
00:41:54,278 --> 00:41:56,679
<i>It's not a game anymore,</i>

864
00:41:57,732 --> 00:41:59,832
<i>and we're not kids.</i>

865
00:42:02,537 --> 00:42:05,404
<i>You can cry
"mercy" all you want,</i>

866
00:42:05,473 --> 00:42:07,507
<i>but nobody's listening.</i>

867
00:42:08,309 --> 00:42:09,842
<i>It's just you</i>

868
00:42:11,412 --> 00:42:14,213
<i>screaming into a void.</i>
