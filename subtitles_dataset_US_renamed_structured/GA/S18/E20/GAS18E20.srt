1
00:00:06,484 --> 00:00:09,400
You all know her
as a fierce businesswoman,

2
00:00:09,444 --> 00:00:11,533
as an extraordinary surgeon,

3
00:00:11,576 --> 00:00:14,014
but Catherine Fox was...

4
00:00:14,057 --> 00:00:17,060
so much more than that.

5
00:00:17,104 --> 00:00:20,194
For starters, she was my mom.

6
00:00:20,237 --> 00:00:22,587
There was no better mom.

7
00:00:22,631 --> 00:00:25,242
I mean that in some
of the most surprising ways.

8
00:00:25,286 --> 00:00:27,070
I mean, she would make
my Halloween costume

9
00:00:27,114 --> 00:00:28,854
every year from scratch

10
00:00:28,898 --> 00:00:32,162
at an old sewing machine
that her grandmother gave her.

11
00:00:32,206 --> 00:00:33,468
When I'd fall
and scrape my knee,

12
00:00:33,511 --> 00:00:35,122
she would blow on it
when she cleaned it out

13
00:00:35,165 --> 00:00:37,602
and tell me she was doing magic,

14
00:00:37,646 --> 00:00:40,431
blowing the pain away, and she
said it with such conviction

15
00:00:40,475 --> 00:00:43,434
that I think I was like 13
before I started to question it.

16
00:00:43,478 --> 00:00:44,653
Ha!

17
00:00:44,696 --> 00:00:46,611
Before the advent of surgery,

18
00:00:46,655 --> 00:00:49,658
many illnesses were treated
with phlebotomy...

19
00:00:49,701 --> 00:00:51,268
also known as bloodletting.

20
00:00:51,312 --> 00:00:54,358
There's just no one like her...
no one pushier,

21
00:00:54,402 --> 00:00:56,708
no one nosier...

22
00:00:56,752 --> 00:00:59,450
...and absolutely
no one more loving.

23
00:00:59,494 --> 00:01:02,105
Also no one in the world who
would force me to eulogize them

24
00:01:02,149 --> 00:01:03,411
while they are very much
still alive.

25
00:01:05,891 --> 00:01:07,763
I love you so much, Mom.

26
00:01:07,806 --> 00:01:09,069
I hope you live forever.

27
00:01:09,112 --> 00:01:10,635
Oh, baby.

28
00:01:10,679 --> 00:01:13,899
- Oh, that was just wonderful.
- Mm!

29
00:01:13,943 --> 00:01:15,031
All right, April,
you're up next.

30
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:16,424
Wait, really?
Mom...

31
00:01:16,467 --> 00:01:18,426
It's a foolish waste
to wait till somebody's dead

32
00:01:18,469 --> 00:01:20,341
to say all the nice things.

33
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:22,952
I want mine now, and I won't be
apologetic about it.

34
00:01:22,995 --> 00:01:24,084
Don't you think
it's a little morose?

35
00:01:24,127 --> 00:01:26,477
It's only morose
if you make it morose.

36
00:01:26,521 --> 00:01:28,088
All right, well, I am here
on official business,

37
00:01:28,131 --> 00:01:30,046
so I'm gonna go track down
Jamarah Blake.

38
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,439
I'll see you later.
Right.

39
00:01:31,482 --> 00:01:33,267
Go save the program.

40

41

with those eyes.

42
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:39,621
Those eyes have magic.

43
00:01:39,664 --> 00:01:41,144
Okay, you ready?

44
00:01:41,188 --> 00:01:43,320
Oh, no, April, stay.
Come on.
What?

45
00:01:43,364 --> 00:01:45,235
I want my speech.
Uh...

46
00:01:45,279 --> 00:01:47,498
Bloodletting is
the withdrawal of blood

47
00:01:47,542 --> 00:01:51,198
from a patient to prevent
or cure illness and disease.

48
00:01:52,677 --> 00:01:54,331
It was one of the most common
medical practices

49
00:01:54,375 --> 00:01:55,854
performed by surgeons

50
00:01:55,898 --> 00:01:59,119
from ancient Greece
until the late 19th century.

51
00:01:59,162 --> 00:02:00,642
Why don't more people
donate blood?

52
00:02:00,685 --> 00:02:02,078
It's an excellent
question.

53
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,340
Do they not know
it could be their family,

54
00:02:03,384 --> 00:02:04,950
their friends?

55
00:02:04,994 --> 00:02:06,735
Well, have you donated
this month?

56
00:02:06,778 --> 00:02:07,997
I'm a gay man, Ben.

57
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,260
They don't want
my dirty, gay blood.

58
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:13,089
Yes. It's a leftover from HIV
and all the fear about it...

59
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:16,397
I know what it's left over from,
but science has advanced.

60
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:20,531
We can test for HIV now, and yet
the guideline still remains,

61
00:02:20,575 --> 00:02:22,142
which is lazy and gross.

62
00:02:22,185 --> 00:02:24,056
Yeah, it is.
It's also stupid,

63
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:27,408
because no one rallies
like the gay men rally,

64
00:02:27,451 --> 00:02:29,540
and the blood shortage
would be over in a week

65
00:02:29,584 --> 00:02:31,542
if they changed the law.

66
00:02:31,586 --> 00:02:33,849
We'd have dance parties
at the blood-a-thon.

67
00:02:33,892 --> 00:02:35,677
I know you would.

68
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,201
The practice has largely been
abandoned, because we now know

69
00:02:38,245 --> 00:02:40,769
that in the overwhelming
majority of cases,

70
00:02:40,812 --> 00:02:44,033
the use of bloodletting
is harmful to patients.

71
00:02:44,076 --> 00:02:46,992
And yet, we did it
as a standard medical practice

72
00:02:47,036 --> 00:02:49,647
for over 2,000 years.

73
00:02:49,691 --> 00:02:53,303
It wasn't a blip in the history
of medicine. It was an era.

74
00:02:53,347 --> 00:02:56,045
This liver is just going to
continue to ooze...

more units here.

specialized personnel

Ms. Blake, any chance
you want to share

186
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:51,367
what it is you're thinking here?

187
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,891
Meredith Grey
is leaving Grey-Sloan.

188
00:06:55,066 --> 00:06:57,591
Well, she's indicated
that after, uh,

189
00:06:57,634 --> 00:06:58,853
we get back on our feet,

190
00:06:58,896 --> 00:07:00,463
she has a desire to... No, no.

191
00:07:00,507 --> 00:07:03,118
A plan.
Yes.

192
00:07:03,161 --> 00:07:05,555
She said she, uh,
does have plans to leave.

193
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:07,122
Mm. And I only know that

194
00:07:07,165 --> 00:07:09,994
because I overheard it
from a resident.

195
00:07:10,038 --> 00:07:13,215
So what I was thinking
while you were talking

196
00:07:13,258 --> 00:07:16,261
is that I wonder what else
is being kept hidden from me.

197
00:07:16,305 --> 00:07:18,742
What I was thinking is
that this man,

198
00:07:18,786 --> 00:07:22,833
he wears a suit well
and talks a real good game,

199
00:07:22,877 --> 00:07:25,053
but what else is he not saying?

200
00:07:25,096 --> 00:07:26,402
Dr. Rose to the NICU.

201
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,535
Dr. Rose to the NICU.

202
00:07:28,578 --> 00:07:30,537
These burn pit victims...

203
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:32,190
some of them were just kids
when they signed up.

204
00:07:32,234 --> 00:07:34,323
Now they're dying in their 20s
with lungs so scarred

205
00:07:34,366 --> 00:07:35,846
they don't even look like lungs.

206
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:37,239
Come on, Bailey,
just let us go, please.

207
00:07:37,282 --> 00:07:38,719
I can't.
He will go to jail.

208
00:07:38,762 --> 00:07:40,460
Not my problem.

209
00:07:40,503 --> 00:07:41,548
It's not my doing.

210
00:07:41,591 --> 00:07:43,506
What if this was Ben?

211
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:44,768
Ben would never.

212
00:07:44,812 --> 00:07:46,378
Are you sure?

213
00:07:46,422 --> 00:07:48,468
Ben isn't much of
a rule-follower, as I recall.

214
00:07:48,511 --> 00:07:50,818
He may not be a rule-follower,

215
00:07:50,861 --> 00:07:52,602
but he is not a law-breaker!

216
00:07:52,646 --> 00:07:53,951
Do you really believe that

217
00:07:53,995 --> 00:07:55,213
these soldiers should be
left alone

218
00:07:55,257 --> 00:07:58,086
to die a slow
and brutally painful death?

219
00:07:58,129 --> 00:08:00,175
They're bankrupting
their families along the way.

220
00:08:00,218 --> 00:08:03,352
You work to change the law!
You do not break the law!

Bailey...

these soldiers have survived

and what they've sacrificed.

226

Their lungs are full
of scar tissue caused

227
00:08:17,627 --> 00:08:21,892
by short-sighted decisions
made by our U.S. military.

228

No.

255

No, because I have fallen in
love so many time in my life,

about the Webber Method.

754
00:31:37,286 --> 00:31:40,594
Right.
Now, Dr. Webber tried
to reinvent the wheel,

which you objected to initially...
Right. Yes.

756

Yes.

757
00:31:45,164 --> 00:31:47,906

it's a dysfunctional family,

761
00:31:56,523 --> 00:32:01,441

as to who is in charge.

crumble completely, Mer?

885
00:37:57,231 --> 00:37:58,928
Alright?
It can't not exist.

886
00:37:58,972 --> 00:38:00,278
It's your name on the building.

887
00:38:00,321 --> 00:38:02,323
That's Lexie's name.Exactly.

888
00:38:02,367 --> 00:38:03,672
It's a standing tribute
to everything and everyone

889
00:38:03,716 --> 00:38:05,544
who's ever trained here.

890
00:38:05,587 --> 00:38:07,546
But, I mean, if I lose you
and Richard at the same time,

891
00:38:07,589 --> 00:38:08,982
that sends a signal to the world

892
00:38:09,025 --> 00:38:10,505
that there's nothing here
worth saving.

893
00:38:10,549 --> 00:38:11,898
Dr. Grey.

894
00:38:13,073 --> 00:38:15,597
Hi. What's this?

895
00:38:15,641 --> 00:38:17,991
Keys to the chief's office.

You broke it, you bought it.

897
00:38:20,602 --> 00:38:26,695
I have to protect my health
and my sanity first, so...

898
00:38:26,739 --> 00:38:28,349
I quit.

899
00:38:28,393 --> 00:38:29,698
I'm done.

900
00:38:29,742 --> 00:38:31,134
No notice.

901
00:38:31,178 --> 00:38:33,833
Pru and I have cookies to make.

902

Yes, baby girl.

903
00:38:36,662 --> 00:38:38,228
You heard me right.

904
00:38:38,272 --> 00:38:41,014
Cookies. Yeah.

905
00:38:41,057 --> 00:38:44,104
Surgeons and doctors,
as a general rule,

906
00:38:44,147 --> 00:38:46,367
like to know for sure
that we are right

907
00:38:46,411 --> 00:38:47,673

908
00:38:50,284 --> 00:38:52,591

can't leave.

911
00:38:58,031 --> 00:38:59,685
And the title chief of surgery.

912
00:38:59,728 --> 00:39:02,122

She will be back.

00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:07,475
Hey, Meredith.

915
00:39:10,086 --> 00:39:12,524
Uh, okay.
Everyone's weird today.

916
00:39:12,567 --> 00:39:15,048
