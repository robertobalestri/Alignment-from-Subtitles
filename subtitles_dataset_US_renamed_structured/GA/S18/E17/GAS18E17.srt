Morning, Chief.
Who is our new intern?

Hi, my name is Pru.

50
00:02:37,853 --> 00:02:41,509
Hi, Pru. I'm Maggie.
It's so nice to meet you.

51
00:02:41,552 --> 00:02:43,075
No, oh, no, have you all seen
this board?

52
00:02:43,119 --> 00:02:46,078
Cancelled, postponed,
incomplete staff.

53
00:02:46,122 --> 00:02:48,820
No, oh...
okay, you know what?

54
00:02:48,864 --> 00:02:51,910
I took a few days off,
found my joy again,

55
00:02:51,954 --> 00:02:54,435
brought my joy to work,
was gonna carry my joy all day,

56
00:02:54,478 --> 00:02:56,741
but now I have to leave my joy
at daycare

57
00:02:56,785 --> 00:02:58,874
because clearly nothing was done
in my absence!

58
00:03:00,136 --> 00:03:03,879
Saving this program
is a "we" problem,

59
00:03:03,922 --> 00:03:04,967
not a "me" problem.

60
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:07,665
So we need to fix this.

61
00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:11,278
Remind everyone why Grey-Sloan
is the premier place to work.

62
00:03:11,321 --> 00:03:13,149
And then get me a list
of people

63
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,673
whose names
belong on this board.

64
00:03:17,153 --> 00:03:18,589
Well?

65
00:03:18,633 --> 00:03:20,243
Uh, uh, I'm sorry?
Just us or...

66
00:03:20,287 --> 00:03:21,766
No, everyone!

67
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:24,334
Spread the word. Go.
Save the program.

68
00:03:24,378 --> 00:03:26,075
Save lives. Educate!
Alright, here we go.

69
00:03:26,118 --> 00:03:27,337
And if you need me,

70
00:03:27,381 --> 00:03:29,426
I'll be in
the ninth floor conference room

71
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:31,298
because my office
has a smell.

72
00:03:31,341 --> 00:03:33,082
That does not
bring me joy.

73
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:35,215
See that, baby girl?

74
00:03:35,258 --> 00:03:37,478
That is reclaiming
your power.

75
00:03:39,436 --> 00:03:42,396
Feels like
my first day of school.

76
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:43,614
Yeah, and you've
already been called

77
00:03:43,658 --> 00:03:45,050
to the
principal's office.

78
00:03:45,094 --> 00:03:46,965
Yeah, seriously.
Why am I so nervous?

79
00:03:47,009 --> 00:03:48,228
Because Bailey likes it
that way.

80
00:03:48,271 --> 00:03:50,099
She thrives
on terrifying people.

81
00:03:50,142 --> 00:03:52,014
So you're still mad
about what she said?

82
00:03:52,057 --> 00:03:53,537
She hasn't apologized
to me,

83
00:03:53,581 --> 00:03:55,931
which means
that she's still mad.

84
00:03:55,974 --> 00:03:57,411
Which means
that I'm still mad.

85
00:03:57,454 --> 00:03:59,500
Well, then,
this meeting's gonna go great.

86
00:04:02,024 --> 00:04:03,895
Oh, hey, Dr. Webber.
It's nice to...

87
00:04:06,942 --> 00:04:09,727
Dr. Webber?
This is Nick Marsh.

88
00:04:09,771 --> 00:04:12,208
He's going to be here
for a couple of months.

89
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,557
It's nice to finally meet you,
Dr. Webber.

90
00:04:13,601 --> 00:04:14,776
Uh-huh.

91
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:15,951
Here.

92
00:04:20,216 --> 00:04:21,783
What was that about?

93
00:04:21,826 --> 00:04:24,829
There used to be snacks
in here.

94
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,571
Richard.

95
00:04:29,051 --> 00:04:30,661
Richard.

96
00:04:30,705 --> 00:04:31,445
Huh?

97
00:04:31,488 --> 00:04:33,273
Are you okay?

98
00:04:33,316 --> 00:04:34,970
When'd you get here?

99
00:04:36,058 --> 00:04:37,494
Come with me.

100
00:04:40,323 --> 00:04:41,759
Come with me,
please.

101
00:04:43,239 --> 00:04:45,328
So yesterday
we asked Leo

102
00:04:45,372 --> 00:04:46,982
if he wanted us to tell
Ms. Patty...

103
00:04:47,025 --> 00:04:49,680
she runs the daycare...
that he was a girl.

104
00:04:49,724 --> 00:04:50,768
And?

105
00:04:50,812 --> 00:04:52,640
And he asked
for a string cheese.

106
00:04:52,683 --> 00:04:54,032
Well, I mean, but...

107
00:04:54,076 --> 00:04:56,208
but he nodded
before he asked for the cheese.

108
00:04:56,252 --> 00:04:58,820
You said that
we could consider disclosing

109
00:04:58,863 --> 00:05:00,735
what's going on to other people
if we see signs.

110
00:05:00,778 --> 00:05:03,390
Persistent, consistent,
and insistent signs.

111
00:05:03,433 --> 00:05:06,828
Mm. The only insistent thing
is the request for snacks, so...

112
00:05:06,871 --> 00:05:08,177
And that's okay.

113
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,092
Let Leo be gender creative
right now.

114
00:05:10,135 --> 00:05:11,746
He doesn't need to change
his pronoun

115
00:05:11,789 --> 00:05:13,182
or his name
or his clothes.

116
00:05:13,225 --> 00:05:14,966
Well, uh,
if we're not doing that,

117
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:16,577
then...
then what are we doing?

118
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,709
Supporting and affirming.

119
00:05:18,753 --> 00:05:20,015
You're following Leo's lead.

120
00:05:20,058 --> 00:05:21,538
Which may be one thing today,

121
00:05:21,582 --> 00:05:23,540
but it might be something
completely different tomorrow.

122
00:05:23,584 --> 00:05:24,889
It's hard to know.

123
00:05:24,933 --> 00:05:27,370
What is it?

124
00:05:27,414 --> 00:05:32,375
It's just
Teddy loves ambiguity, so...

125
00:05:34,029 --> 00:05:36,858
Take her to trauma one.
Thank you.

126
00:05:36,901 --> 00:05:38,773
Bailey's got you
covering the pit, too?

127
00:05:38,816 --> 00:05:41,428
Apparently she thinks
I'm an actual machine.

128
00:05:41,471 --> 00:05:43,038
I haven't seen you
in days.

129
00:05:43,081 --> 00:05:45,910
I know.
What are you up to tonight?

130
00:05:45,954 --> 00:05:46,998
I'm hanging out
with Todd.

131
00:05:47,042 --> 00:05:48,086
Oh, can you watch Luna
tonight?

132
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:50,437
I meant to text you.
Seriously?

133
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,916
It's just that you know
her bedtime routine,

134
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,961
and a new sitter
would have to learn...

135
00:05:53,004 --> 00:05:54,005
Did you page me
for this?

136
00:05:55,485 --> 00:05:57,618
No. Bed four.

137
00:05:57,661 --> 00:05:59,750
Patient came in with
abdominal pain and vomiting.

138
00:05:59,794 --> 00:06:01,883
The wife says
he's your patient.

139
00:06:01,926 --> 00:06:03,275
Dr. Lincoln.

140
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:05,365
Oh, hey.

141
00:06:07,236 --> 00:06:09,194
Simon Clark, 38,

142
00:06:09,238 --> 00:06:12,067
status post synovial sarcoma
resection four years ago,

143
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:13,416
has been undergoing
chemoradiation

144
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:14,417
for recurrent lung mets.

145
00:06:14,461 --> 00:06:16,506
I got this one, Helm.

146
00:06:18,552 --> 00:06:19,770
Thought I told you
to take it easy.

147
00:06:19,814 --> 00:06:22,294
Mm,
so no 5k next month?

148
00:06:22,338 --> 00:06:24,906
This morning
I found him in the nursery

149
00:06:24,949 --> 00:06:26,429
barely able to breathe.

150
00:06:26,473 --> 00:06:28,170
He's nauseous,
can't eat.

151
00:06:28,213 --> 00:06:30,346
I think it's his chemo,
but he was adamant

152
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,348
about trying to finish
putting together the crib.

153
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,829
Would you let your mother-in-law
build your kid's crib?

154
00:06:34,872 --> 00:06:36,396
I'm supposed to build
the crib.

155
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:39,137
It's your job to stay alive, Simon.

156
00:06:39,181 --> 00:06:40,661
That's your job.

157
00:06:40,704 --> 00:06:43,185
Okay, we'll get you some scans,
we'll see what's going on,

158
00:06:43,228 --> 00:06:44,882
and we'll make you comfortable
while we admit you.

159
00:06:44,926 --> 00:06:48,103
And no one will build
any more furniture.

160
00:06:48,146 --> 00:06:50,322
Deal?

161
00:06:50,366 --> 00:06:51,062
Deal.

162
00:06:51,106 --> 00:06:53,935
Deal.

163
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:57,765
Any heart palpitations
or night sweats?

164
00:06:57,808 --> 00:07:00,811
Night sweats.
Open your eye.

165
00:07:00,855 --> 00:07:02,247
You've been having
night sweats?

166
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:07,122
Oh, no, no. Just, uh...
it just makes a funny sound.

167
00:07:07,165 --> 00:07:10,995
Night s-s-s-s-sweats.

168
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:16,131
Ni-i-ght swe-e-e-e-e-ats.

169
00:07:16,174 --> 00:07:17,262
Okay,
when's the last time

170
00:07:17,306 --> 00:07:18,916
you had
a heavy metal screening?

171
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,265
Mm, heavy metal.

172
00:07:22,006 --> 00:07:24,139
Thank you, Detroit!

173
00:07:25,923 --> 00:07:28,665
I need you to be very honest
with me right now.
Okay.

174
00:07:28,709 --> 00:07:31,973
I know you're under
an immense amount of pressure.
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

175
00:07:32,016 --> 00:07:33,235
Have you started
drinking again?

176
00:07:35,977 --> 00:07:38,458
Nah. Not in ten years.

177
00:07:38,501 --> 00:07:40,242
Uh, the only thing
I had to drink today

178
00:07:40,285 --> 00:07:44,333
was some, uh...

a bit of a kick.

You know, Catherine's been
buying this, um, boota stuff.

181
00:07:50,034 --> 00:07:53,429
Kamtucha. Komrumba...
Now that's a funny sound.

182
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:54,648
Kombucha?

183
00:07:54,691 --> 00:07:56,519
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Uh-huh.

184
00:07:56,563 --> 00:07:58,303
Kombucha has
alcohol content.

185
00:07:58,347 --> 00:07:59,479
No.

186
00:07:59,522 --> 00:08:00,523
It does.

187

This is not Kombucha.

It's cannabis.

191

It's what now?

192
00:08:16,234 --> 00:08:18,019
You're stoned.

- What am I looking at?
- Margot Talbert, 37,

196
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:47,701
complains of throbbing
abdominal pain

197
00:08:47,744 --> 00:08:48,919
that radiates
to the back.

198
00:08:48,963 --> 00:08:50,921
Aah! I feel like
someone is inside me

199
00:08:50,965 --> 00:08:52,009
and trying to claw
her way out.

200
00:08:52,053 --> 00:08:53,358
Okay, ma'am,
when did the pain start?

201
00:08:53,402 --> 00:08:55,622
Uh, this morning.
Woke up, took one sip of coffee.

202
00:08:55,665 --> 00:08:57,754
And boom... doubled over.
Agonizing pain.

203
00:08:57,798 --> 00:09:00,931
She's nauseous, sweaty,
dizzy, and...

204
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:04,369
Wow.
Yeah.

205
00:09:04,413 --> 00:09:07,155
Alright, well, we'll order
a CT scan, get some labs.

206
00:09:07,198 --> 00:09:08,678
Can you take
some deep breaths for me?

207
00:09:08,722 --> 00:09:10,158
Is there anyone
you want us to call?

208
00:09:10,201 --> 00:09:11,246
No. No one.

209
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:17,208
Okay. Well, we will see you
upstairs soon.

210
00:09:17,252 --> 00:09:19,646
You left early
this morning.

211
00:09:19,689 --> 00:09:21,604
Yeah,
I went for a jog.

212
00:09:21,648 --> 00:09:23,388
I had breakfast
with your brother.

213
00:09:23,432 --> 00:09:26,043
I did not know that he had
majored in anthropology.

214
00:09:26,087 --> 00:09:28,437
Wendell didn't go
to college, Maggie.

215
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,135
He just talks
a good game.

216
00:09:31,179 --> 00:09:33,050
I have rounds,
I'll see you in CT.

217
00:09:33,094 --> 00:09:36,227
Ohhh!
I can't be stoned, Meredith.

218
00:09:36,271 --> 00:09:40,014
I-I-I don't know
if you know this, but...

219
00:09:40,057 --> 00:09:42,625
I don't drink.
Or do drugs.

220
00:09:42,669 --> 00:09:44,322
I know that. It's okay.

221
00:09:44,366 --> 00:09:45,802
You did not mean
to get stoned.
Ohh, ohh.

222
00:09:45,846 --> 00:09:47,412
It was an accident.

223
00:09:47,456 --> 00:09:50,590
Why is there even drug juice
in my fridge?

224
00:09:50,633 --> 00:09:52,113
Well, that doesn't matter
right now.

225
00:09:52,156 --> 00:09:53,593
I have to call Catherine
to come and get you

226
00:09:53,636 --> 00:09:55,116
because I have
a surgery.

227
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:56,944
Oh, no, no, no, no. No.
No, no, no. No, no, no.

228
00:09:56,987 --> 00:09:58,598
You can't call Catherine,
okay?

229
00:09:58,641 --> 00:10:00,164
She has to save
the program.

230
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:02,166
And I have to save
the prog...

231
00:10:03,298 --> 00:10:05,082
I know, I just...

232
00:10:05,126 --> 00:10:06,649
Where are you going?
No.

233
00:10:06,693 --> 00:10:08,390
Huh?
You can't leave.

234
00:10:08,433 --> 00:10:10,522
Let's go sit down,
please.

235
00:10:10,566 --> 00:10:12,046
Come on, come on.

236
00:10:13,308 --> 00:10:14,701
I'm going to get you
some water.

237
00:10:14,744 --> 00:10:16,572
Okay, okay.
Mm-hmm.

238
00:10:19,706 --> 00:10:21,969
Drink that.

239
00:10:22,012 --> 00:10:24,145
Oh, Bailey's gonna be
so mad at me.

240
00:10:24,188 --> 00:10:26,713
And I'm still mad at you.

241
00:10:26,756 --> 00:10:28,366
Get in line.

242
00:10:31,718 --> 00:10:33,023
What do you need?

243
00:10:33,067 --> 00:10:34,459
I'm on your service.

244
00:10:34,503 --> 00:10:36,679
Uh, Nurse Karen told me
that you were in here, so...

245
00:10:36,723 --> 00:10:38,507
Oh, you're not
on my service.

246
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:40,204
You're on
Nick Marsh's service.

247
00:10:40,248 --> 00:10:41,771
Who is Nick Marsh?

248
00:10:41,815 --> 00:10:43,381
Nick Marsh
is taking my cases.

249
00:10:43,425 --> 00:10:46,558
Page him, and tell him
that you are on his service.

250
00:10:46,602 --> 00:10:47,647
Okay.
Okay.

251
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:49,692
Oh, Schmitt.

252
00:10:49,736 --> 00:10:51,172
You didn't see me in here,
okay?

253
00:10:51,215 --> 00:10:52,652
Okay.

254
00:10:57,395 --> 00:11:01,922
Is this
a really big fish

255
00:11:01,965 --> 00:11:06,796
or a re-e-ally
little bear?

256
00:11:09,016 --> 00:11:11,714
Four years ago,
he came in as a newlywed

257
00:11:11,758 --> 00:11:13,803
with stage two
synovial sarcoma of the knee.

258
00:11:13,847 --> 00:11:15,936
And we tried
every treatment possible

259
00:11:15,979 --> 00:11:17,677
while they tried
to start a family.

260
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:21,245
But between the chemo,
radiation, and surgery,

261
00:11:21,289 --> 00:11:24,292
it took them until eight months
ago to conceive.

262
00:11:24,335 --> 00:11:26,120
He made me promise

263
00:11:26,163 --> 00:11:29,210
he'd be here long enough
to meet his kid.

264
00:11:29,253 --> 00:11:32,474
Okay, well, do you think
the, uh...

265
00:11:32,517 --> 00:11:34,258
the symptoms
are chemo-related?

266
00:11:34,302 --> 00:11:35,912
I hope so.

267
00:11:37,522 --> 00:11:40,482
Link, if you don't want to
watch Luna anymore, I get it.

268
00:11:40,525 --> 00:11:42,092
I didn't say that.

269
00:11:42,136 --> 00:11:46,140
Okay, well, earlier, when
I asked, you kind of snapped.

270
00:11:46,183 --> 00:11:48,795
Because I was asking you if
you wanted to hang out with me

271
00:11:48,838 --> 00:11:50,971
and you asked me
to babysit.

272
00:11:51,014 --> 00:11:54,104
Oh God. Okay, I...
I'm sorry.

273
00:11:54,148 --> 00:11:55,062
I didn't realize that that's...
that's what you...

274
00:11:55,105 --> 00:11:56,628
It's fine, Jo.
Oh.

275
00:11:56,672 --> 00:11:58,021
It's... It's fine.

276
00:12:02,156 --> 00:12:02,896
Crap.

277
00:12:02,939 --> 00:12:04,636
Mass in the ileum.

278
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,855
Wow. It's almost...

279
00:12:05,899 --> 00:12:08,423
Obstructing
his small bowel.

280
00:12:08,466 --> 00:12:09,946
I'm so sorry.

281
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:12,383
God.

282
00:12:12,427 --> 00:12:14,646
How am I gonna tell him
it's progressing even faster?

283
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:17,693
We just do it.
Or I do it.

284
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:18,781
He's my patient.

285
00:12:18,825 --> 00:12:21,436
Um, not today.

286
00:12:21,479 --> 00:12:23,351
Small intestine.
General surgery.

287
00:12:24,831 --> 00:12:27,616
Let me try to resect the tumor
at the bowel segment,

288
00:12:27,659 --> 00:12:29,226
buy him some more time.

289
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:32,360
And you can scrub in,

290
00:12:32,403 --> 00:12:34,797
be an extra pair of hands
if there's heavy bleeding.

291
00:12:36,233 --> 00:12:38,192
Come on. It'll be like
we're hanging out.

292
00:12:42,674 --> 00:12:43,632
Hello?

293
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:58,865
Okay, I know you blame me...

294
00:12:58,908 --> 00:13:01,606
I do not blame you,
I do not know you.

295
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:03,304
Y-You think
I'm taking Meredith away,

296
00:13:03,347 --> 00:13:05,088
which i-it's
perfectly understandable.

297
00:13:05,132 --> 00:13:07,699
Meredith is
an adult woman,

298
00:13:07,743 --> 00:13:09,832
no one
can take her away,

299
00:13:09,876 --> 00:13:12,008
it would be ridiculous of me
to think that.

300
00:13:12,052 --> 00:13:14,706
So then why are you being
so hostile to me right now?

301
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:15,664
Oh, you think
I'm being hostile?

302
00:13:15,707 --> 00:13:16,796
Frankly, yes.

303
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:19,276
I'm so sorry,
Dr. Marsh.

304
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,757
Uh, welcome
to Grey-Sloan.

305
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:25,326
I am so grateful to you
for taking pity on me

306
00:13:25,369 --> 00:13:28,198
and offering to help us out
for the next few months

307
00:13:28,242 --> 00:13:29,504
before leaving again.

308
00:13:29,547 --> 00:13:31,114
Okay.

309
00:13:32,899 --> 00:13:36,119
I know you've told your staff
you're hiring locum tenens.

310
00:13:36,163 --> 00:13:38,513
I'm locum tenens.
I'm what you need.

311
00:13:38,556 --> 00:13:39,601
I'm a transplant guy.

312
00:13:39,644 --> 00:13:41,168
I'm also a general surgeon,

313
00:13:41,211 --> 00:13:43,692
so I can help bring others in
and help with your caseload.

314
00:13:43,735 --> 00:13:46,521
I need more than just surgeons,
I need surgeons who can teach.

315
00:13:46,564 --> 00:13:49,654
Hello! Jordan Wright was my
student, and you stole him.

316
00:13:49,698 --> 00:13:52,483
Well, you can have him back,
I put in the transfer papers.

317
00:13:52,527 --> 00:13:55,138
I know, because your
residency program is failing.

318
00:13:57,053 --> 00:13:58,663
I want to help.
I do.

319
00:13:58,707 --> 00:14:00,752
I want to help you.
I want to help this program.

320
00:14:00,796 --> 00:14:03,407
Even though, funny thing,
Grey-Sloan rejected me

321
00:14:03,451 --> 00:14:05,322
back in the day,
and now so are you.

322
00:14:05,366 --> 00:14:07,847
Look, I-I'm gonna
be in Seattle for the
next few months anyway,

323
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:10,937
so if you say no, I'm
just gonna spend my
days hiking and fishing

324
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,721
instead of helping you
with your never-ending list

325
00:14:12,764 --> 00:14:14,636
of appys and choles.

326
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:21,164
I hope he has
your smile.

327
00:14:22,426 --> 00:14:24,254
And your laugh.

328
00:14:26,996 --> 00:14:28,868
And your snaggletooth.

329
00:14:28,911 --> 00:14:30,913
I don't have a snaggletooth.

330
00:14:30,957 --> 00:14:32,262
Ah, don't you?

331
00:14:34,569 --> 00:14:35,918
Mm.

332
00:14:40,836 --> 00:14:42,272
Hit us, Link.

333
00:14:42,316 --> 00:14:43,839
Don't sugar coat it.

334
00:14:45,232 --> 00:14:46,798
We found a new met.

335
00:14:46,842 --> 00:14:48,975
No.

336
00:14:49,018 --> 00:14:50,802
Sweetheart, let him finish.
No.

337
00:14:50,846 --> 00:14:52,456
It's in
the small intestine.

338
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,893
It's causing a blockage,

339
00:14:53,936 --> 00:14:56,808
which explains
your nausea and pain.

340
00:14:56,852 --> 00:14:58,810
We recommend
resecting the tumor

341
00:14:58,854 --> 00:15:00,638
to relieve
the obstruction.

342
00:15:00,682 --> 00:15:03,815
I'm only 32 weeks.
That's two more months.

343
00:15:03,859 --> 00:15:07,254
He has to meet his son.
I need that, Dr. Lincoln.

344
00:15:07,297 --> 00:15:09,865
I need that.Kristen, I know
it's been a long road.

345
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,606
But the road
is not ending.

346
00:15:11,649 --> 00:15:13,956
We're going to take care
of this met today,

347
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,437
...and we'll go from there.

348
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,309
Hey, I'm here, Kris.

349
00:15:19,353 --> 00:15:22,878
Look. Kris, I'm here.

350
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,750
I'm here right now.
Okay?

00:22:55,722 --> 00:22:57,550
I figured it out,
Meredith.

528
00:22:57,593 --> 00:22:59,769
We have to rewrite
the story.

529
00:22:59,813 --> 00:23:01,467
That sounds amazing.
Yeah.

530
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:02,685
Let's go.
Oh.

531

Uh.
You didn't see us.

532
00:23:05,862 --> 00:23:07,429
Okay.

534
00:23:08,561 --> 00:23:09,605
Thank you.

If I don't make it...

536
00:23:14,654 --> 00:23:16,569
Uh, not gonna happen, Simon.
Okay?

537
00:23:16,612 --> 00:23:18,222
I believe you, man.

538
00:23:18,266 --> 00:23:20,660
I believe you
and I believe in you,

539
00:23:20,703 --> 00:23:23,793
but also,
you are not God.

540
00:23:23,837 --> 00:23:27,144
I know you have
a Roman god-like profile...

541
00:23:27,188 --> 00:23:29,930
...but you are not God.

542
00:23:29,973 --> 00:23:31,845
And sometimes
bad things happen.

543
00:23:31,888 --> 00:23:34,848
And if I don't make it,
I need you to tell Kristen

544
00:23:34,891 --> 00:23:36,850
she's not allowed
to name him after me.

545
00:23:36,893 --> 00:23:39,026
Simon cannot be
his first name

546
00:23:39,069 --> 00:23:40,810
and it cannot be
his middle name

547
00:23:40,854 --> 00:23:42,899
and I need you
to convince her.

548
00:23:42,943 --> 00:23:45,859
I want my kid's life
to be joyful.

549
00:23:45,902 --> 00:23:48,688
And if she names him after me,
his life will not be joyful

550
00:23:48,731 --> 00:23:52,256
because every time she calls
his name, she's gonna get sad.

551
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:55,738
And I need you to convince her
that I'm right.

552
00:23:55,782 --> 00:23:58,045
I'll do what I have to do,
Simon, okay?

553
00:23:58,088 --> 00:24:01,222
But my strong preference is
that you survive this surgery.

554
00:24:01,265 --> 00:24:02,528
So I'm gonna need you
to get your head in the game.

Well,
on a positive note,

611
00:26:16,487 --> 00:26:19,621
I think I had an epiphany
on how to reinvent the program.

612
00:26:19,665 --> 00:26:21,449
Or at least improve it.

613
00:26:23,059 --> 00:26:24,800
Addison said
something to me.

614

about the data,

the wins versus the losses

616
00:26:32,678 --> 00:26:34,723
instead of the people.

617
00:26:34,767 --> 00:26:35,855
Yeah, and it worked.

618
00:26:35,898 --> 00:26:37,944
Hell, it worked well,

619
00:26:37,987 --> 00:26:42,209
but it wiped out the...
the humanity.

620
00:26:42,252 --> 00:26:44,341
Our residents forget
they're people

621
00:26:44,385 --> 00:26:46,779
and that they're helping
other people.

622
00:26:46,822 --> 00:26:49,520
So we have to rewrite
that story.

623
00:26:49,564 --> 00:26:53,350
Make sure that they don't lose
or forget the...

624
00:26:53,394 --> 00:26:55,526
the best part of themselves.
Mm.

625
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:58,573
That they can be
whole individuals

626
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:02,185
that blossom and...
and grow with...

627
00:27:02,229 --> 00:27:04,710
with empathy and...
and... and knowledge.

628
00:27:04,753 --> 00:27:07,843
Look, now, I know we can't
improve the program overnight.

629
00:27:07,887 --> 00:27:11,934
But it's like
planting a tree, okay?

630
00:27:11,978 --> 00:27:13,675
I mean,
you prepare the ground

631
00:27:13,719 --> 00:27:16,765
and you...
you nurture the seed,

632
00:27:16,809 --> 00:27:20,116
but the tree that grows
will outlive you,

633
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,858
whether or not you're there
to see it at all.

634
00:27:27,558 --> 00:27:29,996
Are you still high?

635
00:27:30,039 --> 00:27:32,346
Little bit.

636
00:27:39,527 --> 00:27:41,442
Oh, no.

637
00:27:41,485 --> 00:27:44,314
It's wrapped around
the vascular structures.

638
00:27:44,358 --> 00:27:45,576
I see it.

639
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:51,452
Okay, everyone,
change of plan.

640
00:27:51,495 --> 00:27:54,977
We're gonna divert the bowel,
buy him a little more time,

641
00:27:55,021 --> 00:27:56,283
make him more comfortable.
No, no.

642
00:27:56,326 --> 00:27:57,588
Hold on, you're not gonna
resect any of it?

643
00:27:57,632 --> 00:27:59,155
It's too dangerous.
He could bleed out.

644
00:27:59,199 --> 00:28:00,809
So... So he's just supposed to
live with this in his bowel?

645
00:28:00,853 --> 00:28:02,506
I didn't put the tumor
in there, Link.

646
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:04,944
So you're just gonna
close him up with a
stool bag and that's it?

647
00:28:04,987 --> 00:28:07,381
The other option is I close him
without doing anything.

648
00:28:07,424 --> 00:28:08,904
He's dying, Link.

649
00:28:10,166 --> 00:28:11,515
This will help him
with his pain.

650
00:28:11,559 --> 00:28:12,647
He'll live
a better life,

651
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:14,780
even if it's just
for a few weeks.

652
00:28:14,823 --> 00:28:16,912
He wants to meet
his son.

653
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,787

Hamilton should not have
told Richard anything.

701
00:30:30,219 --> 00:30:31,655
The reason why
I didn't say anything

702
00:30:31,699 --> 00:30:34,745
is because I hadn't made
any decision.

703
00:30:34,789 --> 00:30:36,747
Well, thank you.

704
00:30:36,791 --> 00:30:38,445
And I'm sorry

705
00:30:38,488 --> 00:30:42,318
for calling you
"that girl."

706
00:30:42,362 --> 00:30:43,754
I...

707
00:30:43,798 --> 00:30:45,060
Mnh.

708
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:51,023
If Marsh has taken over
your surgeries,

709
00:30:51,066 --> 00:30:52,807
w-where have you been
all day?

710
00:30:54,156 --> 00:30:55,375
With Richard.

711
00:30:58,769 --> 00:31:01,729
He got stoned,
accidentally.

712
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:05,559
I know.
My God.

713
00:31:05,602 --> 00:31:08,562
Just when I think this place
can't top itself.

714
00:31:12,609 --> 00:31:14,350
Thank you, Grey.

715
00:31:14,394 --> 00:31:18,572
And Marsh seems like a...

716
00:31:18,615 --> 00:31:21,270
wonderful...teacher.

717
00:31:22,968 --> 00:31:24,186
He is.

718
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:25,100
Oh.

719
00:31:31,977 --> 00:31:33,761
How long?

720
00:31:36,416 --> 00:31:39,549
Please tell me how long
my husband has to live.

721
00:31:39,593 --> 00:31:41,943
We still
have to do staging,

722
00:31:41,987 --> 00:31:44,598
but from the information
that we have,

723
00:31:44,641 --> 00:31:47,514
maybe a month at most.

724
00:31:54,521 --> 00:31:56,827
His whole life,

725
00:31:56,871 --> 00:32:00,962
Simon always wanted
to be a dad.

726
00:32:01,006 --> 00:32:03,965
He wanted to be
the best dad.

727
00:32:04,009 --> 00:32:05,749
And I wanted
to give him that.

728
00:32:08,056 --> 00:32:09,884
We need to take
the baby out now.

729
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,494
I need a C-section.

730
00:32:11,538 --> 00:32:12,931
It's too early.

731
00:32:12,974 --> 00:32:13,888
Simon needs to meet
his son.

732
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:15,150
Kristen, I think...

733
00:32:15,194 --> 00:32:16,891
I need to talk to an OB,
please.

734
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:19,154
Um, I am an OB.

735
00:32:19,198 --> 00:32:20,982
I am a general surgeon.
But I'm also an OB.

736
00:32:21,026 --> 00:32:22,853
It is too early.
No.

737
00:32:22,897 --> 00:32:23,898
Kristen,
we cannot risk taking...

738
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:25,682
I'll talk to Dr. DeLuca.

739
00:32:25,726 --> 00:32:27,206
Okay, Kristen?

740
00:32:27,249 --> 00:32:29,512
Dr. Wilson is an OB resident.
She's a student.

741
00:32:29,556 --> 00:32:31,036
Dr. DeLuca's her teacher.

742
00:32:31,079 --> 00:32:32,602
I'll check with her,
okay?

743
00:32:32,646 --> 00:32:33,908
Thank you.

744
00:32:35,301 --> 00:32:36,650
Excuse me.

745
00:32:41,176 --> 00:32:42,612
I know you're hurting right now

746
00:32:42,656 --> 00:32:44,875
so I'm keeping my voice quiet,
but that was really not...

747
00:32:44,919 --> 00:32:48,096
That was the truth, Jo.
I told her the truth.

748
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:50,359
You're a first year resident.

749
00:32:50,403 --> 00:32:52,840
You have to stick to the rules.
Maybe Carina DeLuca won't.

750
00:32:52,883 --> 00:32:54,189
Page me when DeLuca
gets that.

751
00:32:54,233 --> 00:32:55,886
You're too angry
to do anything right now,

752
00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:57,279
to talk to anybody
right now.

753
00:32:57,323 --> 00:32:59,107
You need to go smash
some tires with a bat

754
00:32:59,151 --> 00:33:00,195
or a bowl or something.

755
00:33:00,239 --> 00:33:02,067
Just get it all
out of your body.

756
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:03,720
I don't need your advice.
You really do.
I know you best.

757
00:33:03,764 --> 00:33:05,244
You're in no shape for... You're a user, Jo.

758
00:33:05,287 --> 00:33:07,768
You used me.
So I don't need your advice.

759
00:33:11,946 --> 00:33:13,513
You're angry
and you're hurting

760
00:33:13,556 --> 00:33:15,210
and you lash out
when you're hurting
and I can take it.

761
00:33:15,254 --> 00:33:16,995
But if you want to fight
someone, fight me.

762
00:33:17,038 --> 00:33:19,432
Don't go to my boss
and ask for a medically
unsound C-section

763
00:33:19,475 --> 00:33:22,957
because you're feeling emotional.
You used me for sex.

764
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:25,090
Which was fun
so I could roll with it.

765
00:33:25,133 --> 00:33:27,179
But then you kicked me out
which was less fun.

766
00:33:27,222 --> 00:33:29,137
And now you have Todd

767
00:33:29,181 --> 00:33:31,487
so you want me
to sleep over with Luna

768
00:33:31,531 --> 00:33:33,968
any time you have a date.

769
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:35,709
Which... Yeah,
which might be okay

770
00:33:35,752 --> 00:33:37,319
if you ever wanted
to just hang with me,

771
00:33:37,363 --> 00:33:38,277
but you don't.

772
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,757
Which means
I'm being used.

773
00:33:40,801 --> 00:33:43,499
You know, and I could roll
with that because you and I,

774
00:33:43,543 --> 00:33:45,501
we go way back
and everybody's awful sometimes.

775
00:33:45,545 --> 00:33:48,069
But now you want to talk to me
like we're besties.

776
00:33:48,113 --> 00:33:49,766
Like we hang out
all the time

777
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:51,464
and you know me better
than anybody else

778
00:33:51,507 --> 00:33:53,509
so I should listen to you
instead of doing

779
00:33:53,553 --> 00:33:56,556
everything I possibly can
to help my patient.

780
00:33:56,599 --> 00:33:58,079
That I cannot roll with!

781
00:33:58,123 --> 00:33:59,776
I cannot make an exception
for that.

782
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:01,474
So please
get out of my way

783
00:34:01,517 --> 00:34:02,953
so I can do
my damn job.

784
00:34:02,997 --> 00:34:04,738
I fell in love
with you.

785
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:10,265
I wasn't using you.

786
00:34:10,309 --> 00:34:12,398
I had feelings.

787
00:34:12,441 --> 00:34:14,617
I developed feelings.

788
00:34:14,661 --> 00:34:16,010
And I thought
that you might, too.

789
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:17,011
But you didn't.

790
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:18,360
So I asked you
to move out

791
00:34:18,404 --> 00:34:20,971
because I wanted to protect
our friendship.

792
00:34:23,757 --> 00:34:25,106
And you didn't think
that...

793
00:34:26,890 --> 00:34:28,066
...mentioning this
to me...

794
00:34:28,109 --> 00:34:29,371
You're right.
It was wrong of me not to.

795
00:34:29,415 --> 00:34:30,590
But in case
you haven't realized,

796
00:34:30,633 --> 00:34:32,244
I'm not a perfect person.

797
00:34:32,287 --> 00:34:34,768
I'm a person who is doing
the best I can.

798
00:34:34,811 --> 00:34:37,901
But I'm also a person
who cannot lose you.

799
00:34:37,945 --> 00:34:41,079
And I am a person with enough
education in obstetrics

800
00:34:41,122 --> 00:34:43,081
to know that
at 32 weeks,

801
00:34:43,124 --> 00:34:45,474
a baby's lungs
are not fully formed.

802
00:34:45,518 --> 00:34:47,563
And if we take him out
prematurely

803
00:34:47,607 --> 00:34:48,825
then Kristen
runs the risk

804
00:34:48,869 --> 00:34:50,958
of losing both her husband
and her baby.

805
00:34:51,001 --> 00:34:53,091
And I know you
well enough to know

806
00:34:53,134 --> 00:34:54,483
that you can't live
with that.

807
00:34:58,008 --> 00:35:06,104
♪♪

808
00:35:13,067 --> 00:35:15,461
So, we were able
to repair the aneurysm.

809
00:35:15,504 --> 00:35:19,595
Looks like she was in pain
for quite some time.

810
00:35:19,639 --> 00:35:22,032
I kept telling her
to go to the doctor.

811
00:35:22,076 --> 00:35:23,295
Well, it's not easy

812
00:35:23,338 --> 00:35:24,600
for some people
to take care of themselves.

813
00:35:26,211 --> 00:35:29,475
Thank you
for calling me.

814
00:35:29,518 --> 00:35:31,216
She really
didn't want us to.

815
00:35:31,259 --> 00:35:33,435
Well, she obviously doesn't know
what's good for her.

816
00:35:48,668 --> 00:35:51,192
Speaking to you as your boss
and your wife in this moment,

817
00:35:51,236 --> 00:35:52,802
there's no
compartmentalizing,

818
00:35:52,846 --> 00:35:54,935
so you need to tell me
what the hell is going on!

819
00:35:59,113 --> 00:36:01,159
I feel like
I don't know who I married.

820
00:36:01,202 --> 00:36:03,509
Winston, ever since
your brother got here...

821
00:36:03,552 --> 00:36:04,597
you don't talk to me.

822
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,120
And now you're not
talking to him.

823
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:09,732
The tension in our home
is raising my blood pressure.

824
00:36:09,776 --> 00:36:12,518
And then today, you seriously
messed with one of my patients.

825
00:36:13,823 --> 00:36:15,782
You're not yourself
and I need to know why.

826
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:17,958
Come with me.

827
00:36:26,532 --> 00:36:30,013
When... When I was 16,
we were going out with friends

828
00:36:30,057 --> 00:36:33,365
and Wendell asked me to pick him
up at the mall with his buddy.

829
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:35,193
And so I'm sitting in the car
waiting for him

830
00:36:35,236 --> 00:36:36,716
and they both
jump in the back seat

831
00:36:36,759 --> 00:36:38,631
and tell me to drive off
as fast as I can.

832
00:36:38,674 --> 00:36:40,981
And I did it
because he's my brother.

833
00:36:41,024 --> 00:36:42,678
And so I did
what he said.

834
00:36:42,722 --> 00:36:44,114
Then the cops
pull us over.

835
00:36:44,158 --> 00:36:45,725
And there's stolen goods
in the car

836
00:36:45,768 --> 00:36:46,726
and I'm behind
the wheel.

837
00:36:46,769 --> 00:36:47,944
I'm the getaway driver.

838
00:36:47,988 --> 00:36:50,643
I got arrested.

839
00:36:50,686 --> 00:36:53,123
I had to see a probation officer
for four months.

840
00:36:53,167 --> 00:36:56,997
But Wendell
talked his way out of it.

841
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,912
He let me take
the whole rap.

842
00:36:58,955 --> 00:37:01,088
Everything is like this
with him.

843
00:37:01,131 --> 00:37:03,264
And he comes around
and I'm just...

844
00:37:03,308 --> 00:37:04,700
I'm... I'm, like...
I'm right back there.

845
00:37:04,744 --> 00:37:06,224
I'm right back
to grade school

846
00:37:06,267 --> 00:37:08,661
when he would trick kids
into giving him lunch money.

847
00:37:08,704 --> 00:37:09,792
And our dad
would find out about it

848
00:37:09,836 --> 00:37:11,794
and he would take a belt
to both of us

849
00:37:11,838 --> 00:37:13,013
and keep the money.

850
00:37:14,971 --> 00:37:17,626
His patches don't work.
Just another one of his scams.

851
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:19,367
Which he spent ten grand on.

852
00:37:19,411 --> 00:37:22,109
And now he wants me to lie
and say that they're amazing.

853
00:37:22,152 --> 00:37:24,938
And... And try to get Bailey
to place an order.

854
00:37:24,981 --> 00:37:26,940
Yeah, well, you can't do that.I know.
But that's what he does.

855
00:37:26,983 --> 00:37:29,247
He gets in my head
and he confuses me

856
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:30,857
and the next thing I know
I'm yelling at patients.

857
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,815
And I'm lying
to my wife.

858
00:37:32,859 --> 00:37:35,688
I told you when he got here.
I told you he would ruin us.

859
00:37:35,731 --> 00:37:37,080
I told you
he would just take

860
00:37:37,124 --> 00:37:39,169
any good thing
that I got going

861
00:37:39,213 --> 00:37:41,215
because that's all
he ever does.

862
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:44,305
I'm the sucker who just
convinces myself over and over

863
00:37:44,349 --> 00:37:46,133
that somehow it's gonna be
better this time.

864
00:37:48,309 --> 00:37:50,311
That's who you married.

865
00:37:50,355 --> 00:37:52,400
I know I should have told you
about the patches,

866
00:37:52,444 --> 00:37:54,054
but he just...

867
00:37:54,097 --> 00:37:56,622
like, he makes me a liar
like him.

868
00:37:57,884 --> 00:38:00,408
And I just need
a night to...

869
00:38:00,452 --> 00:38:03,498
I need this night, Maggie,
to talk to him.

870
00:38:03,542 --> 00:38:07,110

just loudly and alone.
