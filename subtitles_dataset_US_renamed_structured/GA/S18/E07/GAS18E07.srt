00:12:36,277 --> 00:12:37,408
Did you work
on the transplant?

360
00:12:37,452 --> 00:12:38,583
I was involved, yes.

361
00:12:38,627 --> 00:12:39,584
So, partial?

362
00:12:39,628 --> 00:12:41,021
Uh, sure.
Great.

363
00:12:41,064 --> 00:12:42,457
I've already secured you
privileges,

364
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,676
and I'll have my favorite
resident scrub in with you.

365
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,939
Me?
Yeah.

366
00:12:45,982 --> 00:12:47,679
There isn't anyone else
who can do this?

367
00:12:47,723 --> 00:12:49,377
There are.
There are several someones.

368
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:51,292
But this guy needs the best.
He needs you.

369
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:53,468
Where am I going?

370
00:12:53,511 --> 00:12:54,817
Fifth floor.
I'll take you up.

371
00:12:54,861 --> 00:12:56,210
Come on.

372
00:13:00,867 --> 00:13:02,433
This is amazing.

373
00:13:02,477 --> 00:13:03,957
We wrapped the syringe
in a thermal coating

374
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,262
to insulate it.

375
00:13:05,306 --> 00:13:07,308
The key is keeping the cells
cold long enough.

376
00:13:07,351 --> 00:13:08,657
Is the injector speed
a factor?

377
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,006
Mm,
that's what we're testing.

378
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:11,138
But it's a careful balance

379
00:13:11,181 --> 00:13:12,574
between speed and temperature.

380
00:13:12,617 --> 00:13:13,836
Game time.

381
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,011
Let's see if it worked.

382
00:13:15,055 --> 00:13:17,100
I'll prep
the next batch of cells.

383
00:13:20,495 --> 00:13:21,931
Okay. And this counts
the viable cells?

384
00:13:21,975 --> 00:13:22,889
Yes.

385
00:13:22,932 --> 00:13:24,847
Healthy cells
reject the dye.

386
00:13:24,891 --> 00:13:26,675
Dead cells
turn blue.

387
00:13:26,718 --> 00:13:29,460
Then the software converts them
to green and red

388
00:13:29,504 --> 00:13:32,028
so we can easily see
how many are still alive.

389
00:13:32,072 --> 00:13:34,074
This takes
so much patience.

390
00:13:35,249 --> 00:13:37,033
You prefer instant
gratification?

391
00:13:37,077 --> 00:13:39,601
Not instant, but...

392
00:13:39,644 --> 00:13:40,863
How long have you
been at this?

393
00:13:40,907 --> 00:13:42,038
Two years.

394
00:13:42,082 --> 00:13:45,128
With no guarantee
that it goes anywhere?

395
00:13:46,086 --> 00:13:47,130
That's why
I like tumors.

396
00:13:47,174 --> 00:13:49,393
They're there,
you cut, they're gone.

397
00:13:49,437 --> 00:13:51,221
Yay.

398
00:13:51,265 --> 00:13:53,745
I don't have the patience
for patients.

399
00:13:53,789 --> 00:13:55,443
You never wanted to be
a clinical doctor?

400
00:13:55,486 --> 00:13:57,619
My teachers encouraged it.

401
00:13:57,662 --> 00:13:59,273
My mom would've loved

402
00:13:59,316 --> 00:14:01,797
to have 24/7 access
to free medical advice.

403
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,973
But being a clinician's

404
00:14:04,017 --> 00:14:06,280
not what attracted me
to science.

405
00:14:06,323 --> 00:14:08,630
It was always
about the discovery,

406
00:14:08,673 --> 00:14:10,850
the openness
to possibility.

407
00:14:10,893 --> 00:14:13,330
And an M.D. felt
confining to me.

408
00:14:13,374 --> 00:14:16,159
So I applied
to PhD programs instead.

409
00:14:16,203 --> 00:14:18,118
Seems like
it worked out.

410
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,077
My mom might
argue with you.

411
00:14:22,774 --> 00:14:24,776
What about you?
Why neuro?

412
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,735
No one ever
asks me that.

413
00:14:26,778 --> 00:14:28,693
They just assume
that it's...

414
00:14:28,737 --> 00:14:30,086
'cause I wanted to be
like my brother.

CT and biochemical work-up

453

A little.
Okay.

460
00:16:27,029 --> 00:16:29,162
Paige freaked out
when I had heart palpitations

461
00:16:29,205 --> 00:16:31,120
at Alex's
volleyball game.

462
00:16:31,164 --> 00:16:32,904
Figured it was stress
from the semi-finals.

463
00:16:32,948 --> 00:16:34,819
Or from having
three teenage girls.

464
00:16:36,212 --> 00:16:37,953
One's trying to get
a volleyball scholarship,

465
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:40,042
one's in callback auditions
for the high school play,

466
00:16:40,086 --> 00:16:42,436
and the youngest
apparently just got dumped.

467
00:16:42,479 --> 00:16:44,003
I don't know how
you keep up.

468
00:16:44,046 --> 00:16:45,221
I don't.

469
00:16:45,265 --> 00:16:46,570
I ended up collapsing
in the third game.

470
00:16:46,614 --> 00:16:48,572
Well, this type of tumor
is extremely rare,

471
00:16:48,616 --> 00:16:50,139
so it's great
we caught it now.

472
00:16:50,183 --> 00:16:52,402
Thanks to this guy.

473
00:16:52,446 --> 00:16:54,752
So, I'll go in from the side
laparoscopically.

474
00:16:54,796 --> 00:16:56,189
It's the least invasive.

475
00:16:56,232 --> 00:16:58,408
Oh, so like
my donation surgery?

476
00:16:58,452 --> 00:17:00,280
Mm-hmm.
Exactly.

477
00:17:00,323 --> 00:17:01,455
You'll be in the room?

478
00:17:01,498 --> 00:17:03,152
Uh, I can be.
If Dr. Grey doesn't mind.

479
00:17:03,196 --> 00:17:04,588
Of course.
No problem.

480
00:17:04,632 --> 00:17:05,850
Yeah.

481
00:17:05,894 --> 00:17:09,985
I'll see you in the OR.
Okay. Dr. Wright?

482
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,814
Okay.
So, tell me what we do next.

483
00:17:24,217 --> 00:17:25,609
Mnh.

484
00:17:25,653 --> 00:17:27,698
They're
my coping mechanism.

485
00:17:27,742 --> 00:17:30,049
Left over from my days
on the swim team.

486
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:33,617
It's a problem.

487
00:17:33,661 --> 00:17:35,837
There are worse habits.

488
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:39,058
Yeah, but these are like
a gateway to fries.

489
00:17:41,538 --> 00:17:44,280
If Grey walks,
would you really leave, too?

490
00:17:45,803 --> 00:17:46,935
She brought me
onto the project.

491
00:17:46,978 --> 00:17:49,590
And she's family.

492
00:17:49,633 --> 00:17:51,026
But we are gonna

493
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:55,291
figure this out because
walking boosts creativity.

494
00:17:55,335 --> 00:17:56,988
I read that
in a study.

495
00:18:02,516 --> 00:18:04,692
Anything?

496
00:18:04,735 --> 00:18:05,910
Not yet.

497
00:18:05,954 --> 00:18:07,129
You?

498
00:18:07,173 --> 00:18:09,000
No. Too distracted
by the thought of fries.

499
00:18:09,044 --> 00:18:10,611
Mm.

500
00:18:10,654 --> 00:18:12,613
When you get stuck in surgery,
what do you do?

501
00:18:12,656 --> 00:18:14,180
You cut or close.

502
00:18:14,223 --> 00:18:15,311
When someone's brain
is open,

503
00:18:15,355 --> 00:18:17,313
that's pretty much
all you can do.

504
00:18:17,357 --> 00:18:20,490
We had to dissect worms
in 8th grade biology.

505
00:18:20,534 --> 00:18:22,971
Total disaster.
Worm guts everywhere.

506
00:18:23,014 --> 00:18:25,930
Cutting was
never my forte.

507
00:18:25,974 --> 00:18:27,323
I remember getting
my first pair of scissors.

508
00:18:27,367 --> 00:18:28,498
I was 4.
Mm.

509
00:18:28,542 --> 00:18:30,152
And unstoppable?

510
00:18:30,196 --> 00:18:31,588
I hated them.

511
00:18:31,632 --> 00:18:33,982
They were so dull they couldn't
cut through butter.

512
00:18:34,025 --> 00:18:36,027
So I stole
my older sister's.

513
00:18:36,071 --> 00:18:37,725
Then I was unstoppable.

514
00:18:37,768 --> 00:18:40,467
I cut the curtains,
my hair,

515
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:42,164
her favorite dress,

516
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:43,818
the tops of
her dolls' heads.

517
00:18:43,861 --> 00:18:47,082
That's disturbing.

518
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,563
I wanted to see
where feelings came from.

519
00:18:49,606 --> 00:18:51,826
What'd you find?

520
00:18:51,869 --> 00:18:53,306
Cotton.
Oh.

521
00:18:53,349 --> 00:18:56,222
It was very disappointing.

522
00:18:56,265 --> 00:18:58,093
Ah.

523
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,573
Time to go back.

524
00:18:59,616 --> 00:19:01,140
You have an idea?

525
00:19:01,183 --> 00:19:05,361
No, but I only allotted myself
15 minutes to stress out.

526
00:19:05,405 --> 00:19:07,842
And honestly,
I feel better.

527
00:19:14,675 --> 00:19:16,807
His s-sword! I can use
that to secure the tourniquet.

528
00:19:16,851 --> 00:19:19,723
Okay.

529
00:19:19,767 --> 00:19:21,464
His heart rate's
all over the place.

530
00:19:21,508 --> 00:19:22,987
His heart condition
makes him prone

531
00:19:23,031 --> 00:19:24,119
to abnormal heart rates.

532
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,425
Could that
be why he fell?

533
00:19:25,468 --> 00:19:26,643
Most likely.
Shock advised.

534
00:19:26,687 --> 00:19:28,384
Stay clear of patient.

535
00:19:28,428 --> 00:19:29,733
Press the flashing shock button.
He needs to be shocked.

536
00:19:29,777 --> 00:19:30,865
Clear.
Now?

537
00:19:30,908 --> 00:19:31,996
You want to argue

00:26:11,613 --> 00:26:12,919
Let's work
on these adhesions.

719
00:26:12,962 --> 00:26:14,747
You think you'll have
adequate visualization?

720
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:16,009
I do.

721
00:26:16,052 --> 00:26:17,532
And you'll avoid getting
into the vena cava?

722
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:19,186
Dr. Marsh,
would you like to scrub in?

723
00:26:19,229 --> 00:26:21,231
No, no, no. No, no.
I'm good. You got it.

724
00:26:21,275 --> 00:26:23,146
His anatomy on the right
seems similar

725
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:24,670
to what you described
on the left.

726
00:26:24,713 --> 00:26:26,149
Yes. Well, you have
to avoid the kidney.

727
00:26:26,193 --> 00:26:27,977
He can't lose it.Not my plan.

728
00:26:28,021 --> 00:26:29,849
He's hypertensive
and tachycardic.

729
00:26:29,892 --> 00:26:31,807
Let's hit him with 5 milligrams
of phentolamine.

730
00:26:31,851 --> 00:26:33,548
Why's his pressure
all over the place?

731
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:35,028
What about
pushing Esmolol?

732
00:26:35,071 --> 00:26:37,160
I think you put too much
pressure on the adrenal gland.

733
00:26:37,204 --> 00:26:39,510
You need to get control
of the adrenal vein right now.

734
00:26:39,554 --> 00:26:42,035
BP's going down.
Okay.
Taking the adrenal vein.

735
00:26:42,078 --> 00:26:44,515
Dr. Marsh,
do you need to step out?

736
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:45,560
I'm sorry.
Excuse me?

737

I'm asking
if you're too invested

738
00:26:46,996 --> 00:26:48,955
in this patient
and need to step out.

739
00:26:48,998 --> 00:26:51,435
Because you're right.
He does only have one kidney,

740
00:26:51,479 --> 00:26:52,872
and right now
I'm responsible for it.

741
00:26:52,915 --> 00:26:54,917
So you either
don't trust me or --

742
00:26:54,961 --> 00:26:56,658

We already tried
transcutaneous pacing.

Okay.
Exactly right.

I can see why you're Dr. Marsh's
favorite resident.

00:28:13,909 --> 00:28:15,128
Thank you.

777
00:28:15,171 --> 00:28:16,738
That means a lot coming
from you, Dr. Grey.

778
00:28:16,782 --> 00:28:18,305
You're part
of a medical legacy.

779
00:28:18,348 --> 00:28:20,524
My mother was one
of the greats.

780
00:28:20,568 --> 00:28:23,266
I meant that you studied under
the esteemed Miranda Bailey.

781
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:24,659
You know Dr. Bailey?

782
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:26,966
I saw her lecture
on preventing post-op fistulas

783
00:28:27,009 --> 00:28:28,315
when I was in med school.

784
00:28:28,358 --> 00:28:29,490
Then I watched every one

785
00:28:29,533 --> 00:28:31,144
of her surgical videos
that I could find.

786
00:28:31,187 --> 00:28:33,146
There's one
of this Whipple.

787
00:28:33,189 --> 00:28:34,800
When she did
the mucosal anastomosis,

788
00:28:34,843 --> 00:28:37,324
her PDS sutures were
all in one motion.

789
00:28:37,367 --> 00:28:38,673
It's like she'd been
doing it forever.

790
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:41,676
Except she was
a first-year attending.

791
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,199
I'd give anything
to learn her techniques,

792
00:28:43,243 --> 00:28:45,027
so assisting you today

793
00:28:45,071 --> 00:28:46,812
is a highlight
of my residency.

794
00:28:46,855 --> 00:28:49,075
Why didn't you apply
for residency at Grey-Sloan?

795
00:28:49,118 --> 00:28:50,729
I did.

796
00:28:50,772 --> 00:28:51,947
Didn't match.

797
00:28:51,991 --> 00:28:53,514

Absolutely.

No, everything is not okay,

now that you're here,
maybe you can fix it.

813
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:26,721
Yeah.
I mean, you're a...

not a bad idea.

819

Stop it.
It is a terrible idea.

We never handed out pizza.
No.

We never threw
free gifts at people.

822
00:29:53,095 --> 00:29:55,968
Never even
offered pens.

823
00:29:57,883 --> 00:29:59,798
Because we've
been enough.

824
00:29:59,841 --> 00:30:02,757
The doctors who work here
have been enough, right?

825
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:04,454
They used to line up!

826
00:30:04,498 --> 00:30:06,021
They used to want us.

827
00:30:06,065 --> 00:30:07,936
Now, what,
we're supposed to beg

828
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:09,068
for their attention?

829
00:30:09,111 --> 00:30:11,679
And give them toys
to try to hold it?

830
00:30:11,722 --> 00:30:13,812
Do you want
to take a break?

831
00:30:13,855 --> 00:30:15,944
Yes, I do.

You used a frozen needle
for this sample, too?

835
00:30:25,301 --> 00:30:28,391
Yes. We are trying them
at different temperatures.

836
00:30:28,435 --> 00:30:29,392

Okay. The injector's set.
We're ready for the needle.

842

Please, God.

843

How cold is that one?

844
00:30:40,229 --> 00:30:41,840
Three degrees Celsius.

845
00:30:41,883 --> 00:30:43,450
One degree colder
than the one in the counter.

846
00:30:43,493 --> 00:30:44,886
What if it freezes
the cells?

847
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:47,802
Well, then
we try again.

848
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:49,108
Okay.

849
00:30:49,151 --> 00:30:50,979
We should inject
before it warms up.

850
00:30:51,023 --> 00:30:51,762
Mm-hmm.

851
00:30:51,806 --> 00:30:53,242

They want 90%?

859
00:31:13,045 --> 00:31:14,176
Correct.

860
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:17,049

00:39:38,854 --> 00:39:41,727
I would like you to meet
Dr. Jordan Wright.

1069
00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:44,077
He's a resident in Minnesota,

1070
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:46,035
but he would like to transfer
to Grey-Sloan.

1071
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:48,386
We did a surgery together.
He's excellent.

1072
00:39:49,256 --> 00:39:50,997
Nice to meet you,
Dr. Wright.

1073
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,782
And tell me why you're
interested in Grey-Sloan?

1074
00:39:53,826 --> 00:39:55,958
You, Dr. Bailey.

1075
00:39:56,002 --> 00:39:57,133
I want to learn
from you.
