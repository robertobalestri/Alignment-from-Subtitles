Barely.

I've been drowning

391
00:15:28,405 --> 00:15:29,972
My patients put off
seeing me for months,

392
00:15:30,016 --> 00:15:31,365
and now I'm dealing
with the backlog.

393
00:15:31,408 --> 00:15:32,975
What can I do for you?
Yeah, I'm consulting

394
00:15:33,019 --> 00:15:34,672
on your patient
Rashida Flowers.

395
00:15:34,716 --> 00:15:36,544
She mentioned that she's not
on the transplant list.

396
00:15:36,587 --> 00:15:38,372
Yeah. Rashida,
she's been through a lot.

397
00:15:38,415 --> 00:15:40,896
Unfortunately, she doesn't fit
the transplant criteria.

398
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,419
But Rashida's
renal function tests

399
00:15:42,463 --> 00:15:44,247
seem to make her
a prime candidate.

400
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:46,380
Well, you would think,
but Rashida's eGFR is high.

401
00:15:46,423 --> 00:15:48,382
It's over 20, disqualifying her
from the list.

402
00:15:48,425 --> 00:15:49,992
Estimated.
I'm sorry?

403
00:15:50,036 --> 00:15:51,951
It's an estimated number of what
her kidney function should be,

404
00:15:51,994 --> 00:15:53,561
not what it really is.
Dr. Ndugu,

405
00:15:53,604 --> 00:15:56,346
the eGFR is the standard
clinical formula,

406
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:58,566
used in the field
for the past 20 years.

407
00:15:58,609 --> 00:16:00,742
It's what we use to determine
care and qualification

409
00:16:02,265 --> 00:16:04,224

from having to need dialysis

just doesn't qualify.

Black woman with chronic kidney
disease from diabetes.

482

She hasn't been able

Almost the same age, weight, and
health profile to my patient.

490
00:19:02,619 --> 00:19:05,796
The only real differentiating
factor is that they're white.

491
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,581
So their eGFR measures lower,

492
00:19:07,624 --> 00:19:10,236
making them
better transplant candidates.

493
00:19:10,279 --> 00:19:12,412
When the estimated GFR
was developed,

494
00:19:12,455 --> 00:19:15,893
it was assumed that Black people
have higher muscle mass.

495
00:19:15,937 --> 00:19:17,939
It added a multiplier
to account for that assumption,

496
00:19:17,982 --> 00:19:20,202
which then increases
a Black patient's GFR

497
00:19:20,246 --> 00:19:22,117

as having less severe disease

and I know there's no cure.

528
00:20:34,581 --> 00:20:36,496
Just a crap-ton of different
ways to the poor house.

529
00:20:36,539 --> 00:20:38,193
When were you diagnosed,
Sergeant?

530
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,542
About a year ago.

531
00:20:39,586 --> 00:20:41,762
I started coughing
after the second Iraq tour.

532
00:20:41,805 --> 00:20:43,198
I couldn't shake it.

533
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:46,680
I started hearing from buddies
about the burn pits,

534
00:20:46,723 --> 00:20:49,770
how they were linked
to all these cancers

535
00:20:49,813 --> 00:20:51,075
and mystery illnesses.

536
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:52,947
The VA's gotta cover
these conditions.

537
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:55,645
Barely.

538
00:20:55,689 --> 00:20:57,560
They just started covering
stuff like asthma.

539
00:20:57,604 --> 00:20:59,214
But I haven't heard
of a single vet

540
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:00,781
who's been covered
for conditions like mine.

541
00:21:00,824 --> 00:21:02,783
All kinds of ways to twist it

542
00:21:02,826 --> 00:21:05,002
so you can't prove
it was service-related.

543
00:21:05,046 --> 00:21:07,309
Cherry on top? I lost my job
at the seafood plant

544
00:21:07,353 --> 00:21:09,746
'cause I was too weak
to finish my shift.

545
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:13,533
So I got no insurance, no job,
and a stack of medical bills.

546
00:21:13,576 --> 00:21:15,622
Sergeant, look --Please,
just call me Noah.

547
00:21:15,665 --> 00:21:18,102
Noah, would you sit down
with one of our pulmonologists?

548
00:21:18,146 --> 00:21:21,149
We'll redo your workup, and we
will get you in for some tests

549
00:21:21,192 --> 00:21:22,759
so that we can start
some treatments --

550
00:21:22,803 --> 00:21:25,414
Pass.
No tests, no treatments.

551
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:28,852
Nothing against you guys,
but whatever time I have left,

552
00:21:28,896 --> 00:21:30,724
