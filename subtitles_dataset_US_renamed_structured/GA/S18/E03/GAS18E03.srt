00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,002
"Some chick?"

180
00:06:34,045 --> 00:06:36,439
This will hurt a lot less
if you hold still

181
00:06:36,483 --> 00:06:38,485
and stop referring to women
as baby birds.

182
00:06:39,964 --> 00:06:42,227
Where are all of
the residents today?

183
00:06:42,271 --> 00:06:44,752
There's been monumental progress
made in infertility,

184
00:06:44,795 --> 00:06:46,667
but there is much
more work to be done.

185
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:49,452
With my background in obstetrics
and medical genetics...

186
00:06:49,496 --> 00:06:50,888
And as one of
the foremost

187
00:06:50,932 --> 00:06:52,716
neonatal surgeons
in the country.

188
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,675
...I will always endeavor
to find more options

189
00:06:54,718 --> 00:06:56,546
for women who want
to become mothers.

190
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:58,243
Why isn't her grand rounds
for OB?

191
00:06:58,287 --> 00:06:59,462
Damn it!
Save me a spot.

192
00:06:59,506 --> 00:07:01,377
I'll be back.

193
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:04,380
Fix your face.
It's Addison Forbes Montgomery.

194
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:05,990
Apparently, she and Grey
have a "history."

195
00:07:06,034 --> 00:07:08,558
And whatever happened,
I'm Team Grey.

196
00:07:08,602 --> 00:07:11,822
I heard Dr. Grey cheated with
her husband, Dr. Shepherd.

197
00:07:11,866 --> 00:07:13,781
You mean Dr. Grey's husband,
Derek Shepherd?

198
00:07:13,824 --> 00:07:16,392
No. M-Maybe.
I'm confused.

199
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:17,915
Uh-huh.I heard he was married
to both of them.

200
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:18,916
Probably not
at the same time.

201
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,483

Yeah, you.

What's your name?

206
00:07:26,837 --> 00:07:27,795
Schmitt?

207
00:07:27,838 --> 00:07:29,927
Is that a question?
No?

208
00:07:29,971 --> 00:07:32,016
Schmitt, what are the vessels
found in the broad ligament?

209
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,801
Um, blood vessels
to the ovaries,

210
00:07:33,844 --> 00:07:35,716
fallopian tubes,
and uterus?

211
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,369
Uterus --
not a question.

212
00:07:39,023 --> 00:07:40,503
Correct.
Congratulations.

213
00:07:40,547 --> 00:07:41,765
You're presenting.

214
00:07:45,334 --> 00:07:48,293
Today's case is
a groundbreaking procedure

215
00:07:48,337 --> 00:07:50,513
that has the potential
to change the game

216
00:07:50,557 --> 00:07:52,820
for both fertility
and childbirth.

217
00:07:52,863 --> 00:07:55,518
I will be performing
Grey-Sloan Memorial's

218
00:07:55,562 --> 00:07:58,652
first surgical
uterine transplant.

219
00:07:58,695 --> 00:07:59,609
Go ahead, Dr. Schmitt.

220
00:07:59,653 --> 00:08:01,263
Oh, on my feet.
Okay.

221
00:08:01,306 --> 00:08:04,309
Um...Tovah Freedman,
33 years old.

222
00:08:04,353 --> 00:08:07,356
G-4, P-zero.

223
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:10,315
Had a complete hysterectomy
two years ago this January.

224
00:08:10,359 --> 00:08:12,535
Secondary to
a placental abruption

225
00:08:12,579 --> 00:08:14,232
in the second trimester.

226
00:08:14,276 --> 00:08:16,496
Taking out the uterus was
unavoidable with the hemorrhage.

227
00:08:16,539 --> 00:08:17,671
We couldn't save the baby,

228
00:08:17,714 --> 00:08:20,151
but Tovah really wanted
to be a mother.

229
00:08:21,109 --> 00:08:23,067
I was the youngest of five,
and, yet,

230
00:08:23,111 --> 00:08:25,330
I was always the mom
when we played house.

231
00:08:26,984 --> 00:08:29,813
And when I found out that
Jonathan was also one of five,

232
00:08:29,857 --> 00:08:33,556
it was...
b'shert.

233
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,079
"Meant to be."

234
00:08:35,123 --> 00:08:36,603
In Yiddish.

235
00:08:36,646 --> 00:08:38,343
I had my first miscarriage

236
00:08:38,387 --> 00:08:40,432
about six months
after we were married.

237
00:08:40,476 --> 00:08:42,565
Then it was pretty much
one a year

238
00:08:42,609 --> 00:08:44,654
until we made it to
the second trimester,

239
00:08:44,698 --> 00:08:47,744
and I had the abruption
and lost the baby.

240
00:08:47,788 --> 00:08:50,007
And then it got worse.

241
00:08:50,051 --> 00:08:53,271
Jonathan was diagnosed
with malignant mesothelioma.

242
00:08:53,315 --> 00:08:56,884
And before he did chemo,
we froze his sperm.

243
00:08:56,927 --> 00:08:58,233
When Jonathan passed away,

244
00:08:58,276 --> 00:08:59,887
I couldn't imagine
being a parent without him.

245
00:09:02,454 --> 00:09:04,935
But then I heard about
Dr. Montgomery's clinical trial

246
00:09:04,979 --> 00:09:07,155
and I realized that

247
00:09:07,198 --> 00:09:10,550
I could be
the mom I was meant to be...

248
00:09:10,593 --> 00:09:12,943
and maybe even bring
my and Jonathan's baby

249
00:09:12,987 --> 00:09:15,163
into the world myself.

250
00:09:15,206 --> 00:09:17,731
Tovah is the last patient
in my trial,

251
00:09:17,774 --> 00:09:19,210
and her family's
here in Seattle,

252
00:09:19,254 --> 00:09:21,125
so she has
a solid support system.

253
00:09:21,169 --> 00:09:23,650
If all goes well,
I will have met my criteria
