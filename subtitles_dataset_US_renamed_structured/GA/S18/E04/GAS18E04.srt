00:06:22,425 --> 00:06:23,339
Trauma 1 is open.

179
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:24,209
Okay, let's
get him inside!

180
00:06:24,253 --> 00:06:25,385
You stay in the lobby.

181
00:06:25,428 --> 00:06:27,343
I'll update you as soon
as I can, okay?

182
00:06:30,172 --> 00:06:31,956
Niki, you are 5 centimeters

183
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,045
dilated and having
this baby today.

184
00:06:34,089 --> 00:06:35,133
Congratulations.

185
00:06:35,177 --> 00:06:37,309
But it's too early.
I'm not ready.

186
00:06:37,353 --> 00:06:39,268
And -And -And today's
our one-month anniversary.

187
00:06:39,311 --> 00:06:41,183
Wow! It's a special day
all around.

188
00:06:41,226 --> 00:06:41,966
Who's the dad?

189
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:43,272
No dad. Just a hook-up.

190
00:06:43,315 --> 00:06:45,317
We had sex.
A lot of sex.

191
00:06:45,361 --> 00:06:46,841
I had a lot of sex with
a pregnant woman.

192
00:06:46,884 --> 00:06:48,277
It works just the same.

193
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,844
Okay, but, like,
I'm pretty sure that's

194
00:06:49,887 --> 00:06:51,193
outside of
my moral code.

195
00:06:51,236 --> 00:06:52,629
W-Why didn't you tell me?

196
00:06:52,673 --> 00:06:53,761
Look at me.
I thought you knew.

197
00:06:53,804 --> 00:06:54,762
I just
thought you were --

198
00:06:54,805 --> 00:06:56,111
Aaaah!
Okay. Uh, Dustin, right?

199
00:06:56,154 --> 00:06:57,678
Uh, Niki is in good hands.

200
00:06:57,721 --> 00:07:00,681
Why don't you take a breather,
go find some ice chips?

201
00:07:00,724 --> 00:07:02,987
For her, not you.

202
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:05,512
Niki, are you okay?

203
00:07:05,555 --> 00:07:06,991
My chest really hurts.

204
00:07:07,035 --> 00:07:08,993
Okay, Wilson, let's get
an EKG and vitals.

205
00:07:09,037 --> 00:07:10,255
Right.

206
00:07:10,299 --> 00:07:11,648
Okay.
Breathe.

207
00:07:11,692 --> 00:07:13,694
Good.

208
00:07:13,737 --> 00:07:16,348
Okay, now, this system of
concurrent surgeries will allow

209
00:07:16,392 --> 00:07:19,656
us to put experienced residents
in the OR as leads,

210
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,397
and then attendings
can rotate in and out

211
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,007
for maximum efficiency.

212
00:07:23,051 --> 00:07:24,574
I don't like it.

213
00:07:24,618 --> 00:07:25,967
Look, look.
If you look here,

214
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:28,448
the average lap chole
lasts what -45 minutes?

215
00:07:28,491 --> 00:07:30,188
But the most critical
part only lasts...

216
00:07:30,232 --> 00:07:32,234
5 to 10.
Exactly.

217
00:07:32,277 --> 00:07:34,192
Which means, if each
attending rotates

218
00:07:34,236 --> 00:07:35,411
according to the schedule,

219
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,239
we can be in
each and every OR --

220
00:07:37,282 --> 00:07:39,415
At precisely the moment
we need to be.

221
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:40,677
Yes.

222
00:07:40,721 --> 00:07:41,809
I still don't like it.

223
00:07:41,852 --> 00:07:43,941
Bailey, this is the answer

224
00:07:43,985 --> 00:07:45,726
to our biggest challenge
right now --

225
00:07:45,769 --> 00:07:47,249
the physician shortage.

226
00:07:47,292 --> 00:07:48,859
A-And it's lap choles.

227
00:07:48,903 --> 00:07:50,948
It's not transplants
and Whipples.

228
00:07:50,992 --> 00:07:52,994
Look, this generation
of residents --

229
00:07:53,037 --> 00:07:55,823
they don't have a thousand hours
to watch us operate

230
00:07:55,866 --> 00:07:57,389
while we work them
to the bone.

231
00:07:57,433 --> 00:07:59,566
I mean, they want to
work smarter, not harder.

232
00:07:59,609 --> 00:08:00,654
And who would blame them?

233
00:08:00,697 --> 00:08:02,960
I don't need
generation education.

234
00:08:03,004 --> 00:08:05,049
I need patients
not to die.

235
00:08:05,093 --> 00:08:07,138
I've been saying
for a long time that

236
00:08:07,182 --> 00:08:09,271
we need to get the residents
out of the lab and into the OR.

237
00:08:09,314 --> 00:08:10,707
Uh...

238
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:11,839
What do you say, Bailey?

239
00:08:11,882 --> 00:08:14,232
You ready to do
12 lap choles today?

240
00:08:15,364 --> 00:08:17,888
Look, the system only works
with three attendings.

241
00:08:17,932 --> 00:08:19,847
We all have to be
on board.

242
00:08:21,849 --> 00:08:23,677
God help us. Fine.
Let's do it.

243
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,548
You won't regret it.
Okay.

244
00:08:25,592 --> 00:08:26,549
Let's not go that far.

00:08:35,689 --> 00:08:37,995
Do you have a quick second
for a pediatric consult?

249
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,910
For Grey's award-winning
abdomen? Sure.

250
00:08:39,954 --> 00:08:41,999
A 14-year-old kid,

251
00:08:42,043 --> 00:08:44,088
plays soccer in a park
near our hotel.

252
00:08:44,132 --> 00:08:45,481
Mm-hmm.
Seemed to be getting

253
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:46,874
extra winded
the other day.

254
00:08:46,917 --> 00:08:48,658
Um, his ankles look
a little swollen.

255
00:08:48,702 --> 00:08:50,312
Is that --
Is that anything?

256
00:08:50,355 --> 00:08:52,793
Could be. Or not.

257
00:08:52,836 --> 00:08:54,403
I'm sorry.
I'd have to examine him myself

258
00:08:54,446 --> 00:08:55,883
to tell you anything
more definitive.

259
00:08:55,926 --> 00:08:58,363
I was afraid
you'd say that.

260
00:09:01,758 --> 00:09:03,412
So, how'd you meet Noah?

261
00:09:03,455 --> 00:09:05,283
He avoids doctors like
the plague.

262
00:09:05,327 --> 00:09:07,024
<i>I, uh, treated him
and his son recently. </i>

<i>Or the car.</i>

Noah's the closest thing
I have to a son.

267
00:09:16,294 --> 00:09:19,471
Met him when he was
a pimple-faced recruit

268
00:09:19,515 --> 00:09:21,256
whose voice had barely dropped.

269
00:09:21,299 --> 00:09:24,172

His wife? <i>No, not yet.</i>

273
00:09:29,917 --> 00:09:33,224
I love Noah, but he punched
above his weight on that one.

277
00:09:40,536 --> 00:09:42,233
Lung cancer.

278

Probably an early stage,

279
00:09:43,626 --> 00:09:45,585
but since he's also got
pulmonary fibrosis...

280
00:09:45,628 --> 00:09:48,370
Might as well be terminal.

281
00:09:48,413 --> 00:09:50,415
All because the U.S. military
couldn't be bothered

Um, can you give this
to Niki?

386
00:13:23,106 --> 00:13:26,370
She asked me to charge it,
and so it's charged.

387
00:13:26,414 --> 00:13:27,719
Here.

388
00:13:27,763 --> 00:13:30,635
Oh, come on.
You're leaving?

389
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:32,768
You can't just hold her hand
for a few hours

390
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:33,900
so she doesn't
give birth alone?

391
00:13:33,943 --> 00:13:36,946
We matched
online a month ago.

392
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:39,731
I'm not a bad guy.
I work at the Post Office.

393
00:13:39,775 --> 00:13:42,212
I live in a studio apartment.
I'm not ready to be a dad.

394
00:13:43,518 --> 00:13:45,433
And she lied to me.

395
00:13:45,476 --> 00:13:49,872
I mean, don't you think this
is a pretty big lie?

396
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:51,700
Just give me the phone.

397
00:14:02,319 --> 00:14:03,277
Okay.

398
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,582
Um...

399
00:14:07,368 --> 00:14:10,806
Farouk's EKG shows
nonspecific ST changes.

400
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,155
And I hear
a concerning murmur.

401
00:14:12,199 --> 00:14:14,157
So I'm not losing
my mind.

402
00:14:14,201 --> 00:14:15,376
No.

403
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:20,555
Is there anything
I should know

404
00:14:20,598 --> 00:14:22,209
about Farouk's
medical history?

405
00:14:22,252 --> 00:14:24,211
He used to get a lot
of ear infections.

406
00:14:24,254 --> 00:14:27,301
He once fell off his bike

407
00:14:27,344 --> 00:14:29,564
and knocked out his two front
teeth, and it was just -Right.

408
00:14:29,607 --> 00:14:31,218
Not relevant.

409
00:14:31,261 --> 00:14:34,134
He was treated for TB about
10 years ago in Iraq.

410
00:14:34,177 --> 00:14:36,614
I don't know anything about the
first four years of his life.

411
00:14:36,658 --> 00:14:37,833
Iraq.
That's where he grew up?

412
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,313
He was born in Syria,

413
00:14:39,356 --> 00:14:40,923
but he came to Iraq
as a refugee

414
00:14:40,967 --> 00:14:42,185
after his parents died.

415
00:14:42,229 --> 00:14:45,580
I raised him while
I was being held as a POW

416
00:14:45,623 --> 00:14:47,930
and, you know,
getting my abs exploded.

417
00:14:47,974 --> 00:14:49,801
You and your brother
both served.

418
00:14:49,845 --> 00:14:51,107
I didn't realize.

419
00:14:51,151 --> 00:14:52,674
How would you?

420
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:55,198
I want to do an echo.

421
00:14:55,242 --> 00:14:56,983
Do it. Do it all.

422
00:14:57,026 --> 00:14:59,899
Uh, Hayes,
and do you mind

423
00:14:59,942 --> 00:15:02,075
just keeping this
between us for now?

424
00:15:02,118 --> 00:15:04,207
If Owen finds out about this,
he'll freak out,

425
00:15:04,251 --> 00:15:05,948
and I'm already
freaking out a little bit.

426
00:15:05,992 --> 00:15:07,471
I've been there.

427
00:15:07,515 --> 00:15:09,778
Of course.
Thank you.

428
00:15:16,263 --> 00:15:18,091
Hey there, Roy.

429
00:15:18,134 --> 00:15:21,398
Well, you two gonna tell me
what you saw on those scans?

430
00:15:21,442 --> 00:15:23,705
My ex-wife looks happier
to see me than you two.

431
00:15:25,315 --> 00:15:26,751
Noah, you mind
giving us a minute?

432
00:15:26,795 --> 00:15:28,928
No, it's okay, Doc.
He -He -He can stay.

433
00:15:31,713 --> 00:15:35,282
Roy, there was an abnormality
in a section of your lung,

434
00:15:35,325 --> 00:15:37,153
and it looks like it's
an early stage of cancer.

435
00:15:37,197 --> 00:15:39,199
Early.

436
00:15:39,242 --> 00:15:41,201
Doesn't sound so bad.

437
00:15:41,244 --> 00:15:43,072
Well, with cancer,
the usual surgical treatment

438
00:15:43,116 --> 00:15:44,334
would be a lobectomy.

439
00:15:44,378 --> 00:15:45,988
We'd take out
that entire section.

440
00:15:46,032 --> 00:15:47,903
But with fibrosis
this advanced,

441
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,731
you can't afford to
give up

442
00:15:49,774 --> 00:15:51,254
that much
of your lung function.

443
00:15:51,298 --> 00:15:52,952
Well, I didn't exactly
think I had a whole decade

444
00:15:52,995 --> 00:15:53,953
in front of me.

445
00:15:55,867 --> 00:15:56,999
So, what're we talking?

446
00:15:57,043 --> 00:15:58,261
A couple years?

447
00:15:58,305 --> 00:15:59,523
Sooner?

448
00:15:59,567 --> 00:16:01,482
Hmm?

449
00:16:01,525 --> 00:16:04,485
What can you do to get me
to Congress next month?

450
00:16:04,528 --> 00:16:06,095
Well, we could try
a segmentectomy,

451
00:16:06,139 --> 00:16:08,315
where we'd just remove
the mass.

452
00:16:08,358 --> 00:16:11,144
It's very risky, though.

453
00:16:11,187 --> 00:16:13,798
Honestly, I don't know
that I'd recommend it.

454
00:16:13,842 --> 00:16:16,932
But it could buy me
some more time, yeah?

455
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,587
Possibly. A little.

456
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:21,763
Well, let -let's do it.
Slice me open.

457
00:16:21,806 --> 00:16:23,330
Roy, no.

458
00:16:23,373 --> 00:16:25,854
Send somebody else
to Washington.

459
00:16:25,897 --> 00:16:28,291
Hey, if I collapse
while I'm there,

460
00:16:28,335 --> 00:16:31,599
it might help our case, right?

461
00:16:31,642 --> 00:16:33,340
It's fine.

462
00:16:33,383 --> 00:16:35,211
I have
a little cancer, yeah?

463
00:16:35,255 --> 00:16:37,779
I've spent
my entire career --

464
00:16:37,822 --> 00:16:41,826
hell, my entire <i>life</i> --
fighting.

465
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:43,611
Why would I stop now?

466
00:16:43,654 --> 00:16:45,656
I want the surgery.

467
00:16:46,527 --> 00:16:48,355
Okay.

468
00:16:53,099 --> 00:16:55,884
Tell me why you
left Scout's dad.

469
00:16:55,927 --> 00:16:57,146
I already told you.

470
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:58,756
No, you told me you said no
to his proposal,

471
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,541
but you didn't
tell me why.

472
00:17:00,584 --> 00:17:04,414
Uh. Well, everything about it
was a disaster.

473
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:07,330
I mean, it felt gaslighty
and manipulative

474
00:17:07,374 --> 00:17:10,464
that he did it
at Maggie's wedding,

475
00:17:10,507 --> 00:17:12,509
using Mer's kids as props.

476
00:17:12,553 --> 00:17:15,686
Is he a gaslighty and
manipulative guy as a rule?

477
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:17,427
No.

478
00:17:17,471 --> 00:17:19,777
Because, you know, the other way
you could see that proposal

479
00:17:19,821 --> 00:17:22,911
is that he was being
incredibly earnest and romantic.

480
00:17:22,954 --> 00:17:24,173
I mean,
if you were a person

481
00:17:24,217 --> 00:17:27,307
who saw the world through
rose-colored glasses,

482
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:30,179
you know, like people in --
in love do.

483
00:17:30,223 --> 00:17:31,615
Okay, I want to go back
to pretending

484
00:17:31,659 --> 00:17:33,052
we don't know each other.

485
00:17:33,095 --> 00:17:34,401
And we'll do that when
the films are up.

486
00:17:34,444 --> 00:17:35,880
How come you get to
make all the rules?

487
00:17:35,924 --> 00:17:37,230
Because I'm older
and because my patient

488
00:17:37,273 --> 00:17:39,101
might be brain-damaged,
and I need to be distracted.

489
00:17:39,145 --> 00:17:41,538
So tell me why
you said no.

490
00:17:41,582 --> 00:17:44,063
Um...

491
00:17:44,106 --> 00:17:46,326
I knew for months that
I didn't want what he wanted.

492
00:17:46,369 --> 00:17:49,155
We had Scout,
and we had Mer's kids

493
00:17:49,198 --> 00:17:51,070
because she was
in the hospital with --

494
00:17:51,113 --> 00:17:53,724
I heard. I prayed.
Yeah.

495
00:17:53,768 --> 00:17:56,249
So we were drowning
in children and domesticity,

496
00:17:56,292 --> 00:18:00,166
and every day, I felt like
I might die of it.

497
00:18:01,254 --> 00:18:03,256
I love all the kids,
but every day,

498
00:18:03,299 --> 00:18:06,389
I thought I might die
of monotony and boredom

499
00:18:06,433 --> 00:18:09,088
and dirty diapers
and dirty dishes and laundry.

500
00:18:09,131 --> 00:18:12,091
And every day,
I thought about doing drugs.

501
00:18:12,134 --> 00:18:15,790
And every night,
I went to virtual meetings.

502
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:17,661
And I am here
to tell you that

503
00:18:17,705 --> 00:18:19,054
those virtual meetings...

504
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,577
...while better
than no meetings,

505
00:18:20,621 --> 00:18:23,624
are no substitute for
regular in-person meetings.

506
00:18:23,667 --> 00:18:24,668
They're not the same.

507
00:18:24,712 --> 00:18:27,018
And, so, I was hanging
by a thread,

508
00:18:27,062 --> 00:18:32,415
and, um, Link...wasn't.

509
00:18:32,459 --> 00:18:35,679
He was falling in love
with domesticity.

510
00:18:35,723 --> 00:18:38,856
And he was
the world's most stand-up guy.

511
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:42,860
And he started proposing
all the time,

512
00:18:42,904 --> 00:18:45,080
despite me saying no.

513
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,256
And he decided that
he wanted more kids,

514
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,563
and I felt like
I couldn't breathe.

515
00:18:49,606 --> 00:18:52,957
And, um, then I judged
myself for that,

516
00:18:53,001 --> 00:18:57,092
like I think
you are judging me now.

517
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,181
During the pandemic,
I drank so much red wine,

518
00:18:59,225 --> 00:19:01,444
I seriously considered
checking myself into rehab.

519
00:19:01,488 --> 00:19:03,185
Really?
Really.

520
00:19:03,229 --> 00:19:05,231
I looked
like a swollen tick.

521
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,799
I lost it.

522
00:19:08,843 --> 00:19:10,323
Lost it.

523
00:19:10,366 --> 00:19:12,934
I just hated -hated --
being stuck at home.

524
00:19:12,977 --> 00:19:14,109
You know,
some people loved it.

525
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:16,198
They baked bread.
I don't like bread.

526
00:19:16,242 --> 00:19:22,204
I began to truly hate
my video-game-obsessed son

527
00:19:22,248 --> 00:19:24,293
and my husband,
who, by the way,

528
00:19:24,337 --> 00:19:27,557
took up a model-train hobby that
seemed to truly delight him.

529
00:19:27,601 --> 00:19:28,993
No.
Exactly.

530
00:19:29,037 --> 00:19:30,212
Mm.
