56

I'm sorry.
Did I invite you?

57
00:01:58,248 --> 00:02:01,251
True. I'd probably just be
a big distraction.

00:02:01,295 --> 00:02:03,340
You know, these eyes

59

60
00:02:04,994 --> 00:02:07,388
I understand.

aren't we?

61
00:02:07,431 --> 00:02:09,041
Not unlike my patient.

62
00:02:09,085 --> 00:02:10,347
No, I'm headed in

63
00:02:10,391 --> 00:02:11,783

liver disease.

64
00:02:11,827 --> 00:02:13,698
Primary sclerosing
cholangitis.

00:02:13,742 --> 00:02:15,787
He's been waiting on a liver
and he was starting to give up,

67
00:02:17,224 --> 00:02:19,487
storm dumps eight inches
up in Bemidji last night,

68
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:22,011
teenager hits a patch

69
00:02:22,054 --> 00:02:23,752
well, that's not
the funpart of the story,

70
00:02:23,795 --> 00:02:25,101
but my guy's getting
a new liver.

71
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,147

bittersweet congratulations.

72
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:28,496

79
00:02:41,422 --> 00:02:43,119
Oh, you changed
your hair.

80
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,251
I did.

81
00:02:44,294 --> 00:02:45,600
It was obviously
a mistake,

82
00:02:45,643 --> 00:02:48,603
so I pulled myself together
and fixed the mistake.

83
00:02:48,646 --> 00:02:50,779
Oh, well,
this looks nice, too.

84
00:02:52,302 --> 00:02:54,391
Long night?
Placenta previa,

85
00:02:54,435 --> 00:02:57,394
which wound up a C-section
at 4:45 a.m.

86
00:02:57,438 --> 00:02:59,091
Mother and baby
are doing great.

87
00:02:59,135 --> 00:03:00,919

You've been working
a lot of nights lately.

89
00:03:03,357 --> 00:03:05,272
A lot of babies come at night.
Yeah, of course.

90
00:03:05,315 --> 00:03:07,274
It's just -- You're not
avoiding me, are you?

91
00:03:07,317 --> 00:03:09,537
No!
Are you avoiding me?

92
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:10,625
Not at all.

93
00:03:10,668 --> 00:03:12,148
Okay.
Great.

94
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,802

104
00:03:27,381 --> 00:03:31,733
Yeah, I understand,
and I am absolutely flattered,

105
00:03:31,776 --> 00:03:33,387
and I-I'll let you know.

106
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:35,258
Okay.

107
00:03:35,302 --> 00:03:37,565
Huh? They finally restocked
on the unsweetened almond milk

108
00:03:37,608 --> 00:03:39,871

a little nudge yesterday.

109
00:03:39,915 --> 00:03:42,265
You're
the only one who cares.

110
00:03:42,309 --> 00:03:43,832
Now walk with me.

111
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:45,225
Everything okay, Chief?

112
00:03:45,268 --> 00:03:47,618
A med school friend
just called.

113
00:03:47,662 --> 00:03:49,272
I haven't spoken to him
in months,

114
00:03:49,316 --> 00:03:53,755
but he works with NASA, at the
Aerospace Medicine Fellowship.

115
00:03:53,798 --> 00:03:55,322
They do research --

116
00:03:55,365 --> 00:03:57,976
On innovative devices designed
to identify and combat

117
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:00,849
spacial disorientation
and vestibular abnormalities?

118
00:04:00,892 --> 00:04:02,329
Of course
you would know that.

119
00:04:02,372 --> 00:04:05,201
I-I just read a paper about
how they've received funding

120
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,116
to start new oxygen-delivery
systems on aircrafts.
Yeah.

121
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:08,509
In aircrafts.
Yes!

122
00:04:08,552 --> 00:04:11,773
Yeah, it's a program
that combines the two things

123
00:04:11,816 --> 00:04:14,254
I've dreamt about
my entire life --

124
00:04:14,297 --> 00:04:16,647
medicine and space.

125
00:04:16,691 --> 00:04:19,737
And at the worst possible time
in my life,

126
00:04:19,781 --> 00:04:23,132
I've been asked to run
their clinical training.

127
00:04:23,175 --> 00:04:24,916
W-Wait. Hold on, wait.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

Chief Bailey, you --

129
00:04:26,788 --> 00:04:28,920

to go to space.

130

I mean, just when I thought you
couldn't get any more amazing,

131
00:04:33,969 --> 00:04:36,841
you go and break
the stratosphere?

132
00:04:36,885 --> 00:04:38,843
I did do that, didn't I?

133
00:04:43,021 --> 00:04:45,937
Pre-op labs, EKG, CXR --
all clear.

134
00:04:45,981 --> 00:04:47,635
Abdominal incision
is healing nicely

What are you doing?
What -- What is this?

143
00:05:01,475 --> 00:05:03,346
Oh, it's for my book.
What book?

144
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:05,261
How do you think history books
are written?

145
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,742
Someone makes a record
for posterity.

146
00:05:07,785 --> 00:05:10,135
We will. Myself,

we will publish
in medical journals.

in there as Patient X.

patients that
I could be helping.

178
00:07:11,605 --> 00:07:13,998
All night, I hear rigs
pulling up outside.

179
00:07:14,042 --> 00:07:16,131
It's torture.

180
00:07:16,174 --> 00:07:17,437
I haven't even graduated
to the treadmill.

181
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,960
You know how you graduate
to the treadmill?

182
00:07:19,003 --> 00:07:20,048
You put in the hours.

183
00:07:20,091 --> 00:07:21,092

No, you either cancel
your sessions

185
00:07:22,529 --> 00:07:24,052
or you yell at the people
leading them.

186
00:07:24,095 --> 00:07:26,620
A solid support system is a
major factor in patient outcome,

187
00:07:26,663 --> 00:07:28,752
especially in long rehabs.

188
00:07:28,796 --> 00:07:30,841
Is Teddy coming by soon,
or...

189
00:07:30,885 --> 00:07:32,321
I'm not sure.

190
00:07:33,409 --> 00:07:36,107
Okay.

191
00:07:36,151 --> 00:07:38,632
Alright, Hunt,
in the chair now.

192
00:07:39,676 --> 00:07:40,677
Let's go.

193
00:07:52,559 --> 00:07:55,126
I had my own Devon.

194
00:07:56,867 --> 00:07:58,565
So I know exactly
what you're feeling.

195
00:08:00,044 --> 00:08:01,916
My patient was
Chuck Higgins --

196
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:03,265
cannery worker.

197
00:08:03,308 --> 00:08:06,094
We met when my wife Adele
made me go on

198
00:08:06,137 --> 00:08:08,618
a food-and-blanket drive
for homeless people

199
00:08:08,662 --> 00:08:10,141
that he organized.

200
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:15,886
Guy with a big heart,
terrible card player,

201
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:17,801
great taste in music.

202
00:08:17,845 --> 00:08:20,151
One day, he came in
for a bowel obstruction.

203
00:08:20,195 --> 00:08:21,631
He didn't like hospitals.

204
00:08:21,675 --> 00:08:23,981
I remember the fear
in his eyes

205
00:08:24,025 --> 00:08:26,375
when he was told
that he needed surgery.

206
00:08:26,418 --> 00:08:28,464
But when I told him
that I would do it,

207
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:29,639
the fear went away.

208
00:08:31,249 --> 00:08:35,036
He told me how comforting it was
to see me,

209
00:08:35,079 --> 00:08:38,039
someone who looked like him,
in a white coat.

210
00:08:38,082 --> 00:08:40,389
Three hours later,
there was a horrible error

211
00:08:40,432 --> 00:08:42,173
in communications
in the OR,

212
00:08:42,217 --> 00:08:43,566
and as a young attending,

213
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:46,569
I was too inexperienced
and timid to speak up and...

214
00:08:46,613 --> 00:08:49,964
And you killed him
like I killed Devon.

215
00:08:51,574 --> 00:08:54,403
We all kill people.

216
00:08:54,446 --> 00:08:57,972
Schmitt, we don't always
kill people we feel close to,

217
00:08:58,015 --> 00:09:01,062
like you felt with Devon,
like I felt with Chuck.

218
00:09:01,105 --> 00:09:03,238
It makes the loss
unbearably worse.

219
00:09:05,632 --> 00:09:08,722
And it's not even his death
that haunts me.

220
00:09:08,765 --> 00:09:10,550
It's the relief
in that man's eyes

221
00:09:10,593 --> 00:09:12,552
when he saw
that I was his surgeon,

222
00:09:12,595 --> 00:09:14,162
the trust
that he put in me.

223
00:09:14,205 --> 00:09:16,860
That's what stays with me,

224

even today.

225
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:21,343

Okay.

427
00:17:11,378 --> 00:17:13,467
Okay, Helm,
how do we get the cells

428
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:15,425
that we inject
into the patient's brain?

429
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:18,254
From his skin?

430
00:17:18,298 --> 00:17:19,603
That is vaguely not wrong.

431
00:17:19,647 --> 00:17:22,911
We take stem cells
from a skin biopsy,

432
00:17:22,954 --> 00:17:25,827
and then we reprogram them
through a complex process,

433
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:28,047
and then differentiate them
into dopamine-producing cells.

434
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:29,874
And by injecting them
into the forebrain,

435
00:17:29,918 --> 00:17:32,573
we are hoping to improve
the dopamine levels

436
00:17:32,616 --> 00:17:34,923
that decreases in patients
with Parkinson's.
What else?

437

lack of access to nutrients,

445

a 30% improvement
