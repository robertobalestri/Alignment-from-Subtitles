Um...

355
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:46,450
Yeah, I'm -- I-I was.

356
00:14:46,494 --> 00:14:48,975
I was -- I-I was
a lot of things.

357
00:14:49,018 --> 00:14:52,152
I was scared when I thought
my mom was dying.

358
00:14:52,195 --> 00:14:53,980
Yeah, I was, too.

359
00:14:54,023 --> 00:14:55,938
But thankfully,
she's here now.

360
00:14:55,982 --> 00:14:56,939
She's okay.

361
00:14:56,983 --> 00:14:58,941
Yeah, but I'm...

362
00:14:58,985 --> 00:15:00,812
still scared.

363
00:15:00,856 --> 00:15:02,771
Yeah, I understand that.
But you know what?

364
00:15:02,814 --> 00:15:05,382
I think all we can do...

365
00:15:05,426 --> 00:15:08,733
is try to take advantage
of the time we have now

366
00:15:08,777 --> 00:15:09,996
with the people we love.
It's mine! It's mine!

367
00:15:10,039 --> 00:15:11,823
- Give me it!
- It's mine! Stop!

368
00:15:11,867 --> 00:15:13,390
Ow!

369
00:15:13,434 --> 00:15:15,349
Oh. Uh-oh, okay.
Oh, God.

370
00:15:15,392 --> 00:15:16,611
What happened?
What, what, what, what, what?

371
00:15:16,654 --> 00:15:17,481
What happened?
What happened?

372
00:15:17,525 --> 00:15:18,874
Oh.
Oh, are you okay?

373
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,310
Ooh, okay.

374
00:15:20,354 --> 00:15:22,312
Ow.

375
00:15:22,356 --> 00:15:23,444
I swear,

376
00:15:23,487 --> 00:15:24,488
I was gonna tell you.

377
00:15:24,532 --> 00:15:25,750
When?
Soon?

378
00:15:25,794 --> 00:15:26,969
I knew you
were gonna do this.

379
00:15:27,013 --> 00:15:28,362
I knew you were gonna be you
and freak out.

380
00:15:28,405 --> 00:15:30,146
I'm sorry. How am I supposed
to react to the news

381
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:31,713
you're dropping out
of college?

382
00:15:31,756 --> 00:15:32,932
I'm taking time off.

383
00:15:32,975 --> 00:15:34,629
Charlotte, you have
two years left.

384
00:15:34,672 --> 00:15:35,935
I want to travel now.

385
00:15:35,978 --> 00:15:37,849
You finish,
then you travel the world.

386
00:15:37,893 --> 00:15:39,851
That's how it works.
The world really is
the best classroom.

387
00:15:39,895 --> 00:15:41,201
Dude. Please?

388
00:15:41,244 --> 00:15:42,506
He's not entirely wrong.

389
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:44,856
Are you serious?
Will you just listen?

390
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,076
Silver and I want
to elevate ourselves,

391
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,426
and Costa Rica's
all about wellness --

392
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:50,601
I'm planning some sweet
meditation workshops.

393
00:15:50,645 --> 00:15:52,299
Man, you've got
to stop talking.

394
00:15:52,342 --> 00:15:54,866
We're gonna stay in an eco-lodge
and be surrounded by nature.

395
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:56,868
Are you hearing yourself,
or am I the only one that thinks

396
00:15:56,912 --> 00:15:58,087
this sounds ridiculous?

397
00:15:58,131 --> 00:15:59,784
Please, help me out here.

398
00:16:01,177 --> 00:16:03,136
Wow, thank you.
You know what?

399
00:16:03,179 --> 00:16:05,268
It's not your decision to make.
How you gonna pay for it?

400
00:16:05,312 --> 00:16:07,270
I have money saved,
and we're gonna make some more

401
00:16:07,314 --> 00:16:09,316
with Silver's...workshops.

402
00:16:09,359 --> 00:16:11,971
They're pay-what-you-can.
That sounds about right.

403
00:16:12,014 --> 00:16:13,407
So, what happens
when you change your mind

404
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:15,365
about the eco-lodge
and your soul mate?

405
00:16:15,409 --> 00:16:17,585
You know, when Silver here
turns to Bronze.

406
00:16:17,628 --> 00:16:19,021
You're gonna be stuck
in Costa Rica with no money.

407
00:16:19,065 --> 00:16:20,153
Who you gonna call
then, huh?

408
00:16:21,371 --> 00:16:22,546
Not you.

409
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:23,983
I'm the only one
you can call!

410
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,946
I think this steak's Wagyu.

411
00:16:33,383 --> 00:16:35,907
An afterlife? Really?
You seem surprised.

412
00:16:35,951 --> 00:16:37,300
'Cause you're
a neuroscientist.

413
00:16:37,344 --> 00:16:39,085
Who doesn't believe
this is all there is.

414
00:16:39,128 --> 00:16:42,479
I think that this life
is part of one long journey.

415
00:16:42,523 --> 00:16:44,655
I don't think I want
to keep living life after life.

416
00:16:44,699 --> 00:16:46,222
It sounds exhausting.

417
00:16:46,266 --> 00:16:48,398
Well, I'd like to think
we do better each time.

418
00:16:48,442 --> 00:16:51,749
So, the next one
will be decent?

419
00:16:51,793 --> 00:16:53,012
Exactly.

420
00:16:53,055 --> 00:16:56,928
So, to temper
your expectations...

421
00:16:56,972 --> 00:16:58,887
the band is okay.

422
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:00,410
The vibe is good.

423
00:17:00,454 --> 00:17:02,847
I would listen
to bad karaoke right now.

424
00:17:02,891 --> 00:17:04,719
Can you watch my Coke?
Mm-hmm.

425
00:17:09,593 --> 00:17:10,812

I had pink hair,
traveled all over Europe.

452
00:19:22,248 --> 00:19:24,293
I had soul mates
that were fun.

453

Maybe.

to do for Charlotte?

457
00:19:34,085 --> 00:19:35,652
To make sure
she got an education.

That's right.

459

Then you should know this isn't
really up for discussion.

460

You have to find a way
to let her be who she is.

464
00:19:52,016 --> 00:19:55,150
That's the one thing I do know
about being a 20-year-old woman.

Barely any.

you're my resident,

491
00:20:55,471 --> 00:20:57,299
so you will assist me
with the surgery.

492

Will you prepare the antiseptic?
Mm-hmm.

493

Surgery?
It's like a play surgery.

494
00:21:00,868 --> 00:21:02,522
You know, like, pretend.
It's make-believe.
