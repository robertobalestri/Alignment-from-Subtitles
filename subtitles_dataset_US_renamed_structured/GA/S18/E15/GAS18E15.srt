335

Our brains don't like
incongruent information.

336
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:28,922
That's why this test
is a good indicator

337
00:12:28,965 --> 00:12:31,794

quite well.

339
00:12:33,709 --> 00:12:35,755
We have decades of muscle memory
in our brains,

340
00:12:35,798 --> 00:12:38,322
and this damn Stroop test
is asking us to ignore it.

341
00:12:38,366 --> 00:12:39,933
Of course, as surgeons,

342
00:12:39,976 --> 00:12:42,022
we have to process
a lot of information

343
00:12:42,065 --> 00:12:44,198
in a short amount of time
as we operate.

344
00:12:44,241 --> 00:12:45,329
I know this.

345
00:12:45,373 --> 00:12:46,940
And I know that
there's a difference

346
00:12:46,983 --> 00:12:50,421

348
00:12:52,119 --> 00:12:55,339
Aging as a surgeon is
a special kind of humiliation.

349
00:12:55,383 --> 00:12:57,559

Deep breaths.

Ah.

711
00:27:12,195 --> 00:27:15,372
You are marching steadily

712
00:27:16,373 --> 00:27:18,158

713

Mm-hmm.

715

716
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:29,865
I know. I'm --
I'm stretched too thin,

717
00:27:29,909 --> 00:27:32,085
and then we took thin
even thinner

718
00:27:32,128 --> 00:27:34,565
with the addition of
a toddler to our family.

719
00:27:36,742 --> 00:27:38,657
And then I heard
Meredith might be leaving,

720
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,267
and I lost it on her,

721
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:42,704
which may or may not
have been fair to --

722
00:27:42,748 --> 00:27:45,228
Wait, wait, wait.
Meredith what?

723
00:27:45,272 --> 00:27:47,274

Mm.

727
00:27:55,978 --> 00:27:59,460

he maybe has dementia?

728
00:27:59,503 --> 00:28:01,331
Or a drinking problem?

729
00:28:01,375 --> 00:28:03,856
No.
Very much no.

730
00:28:03,899 --> 00:28:05,161
Why?

731
00:28:05,205 --> 00:28:06,728
Because he walked out
of his assessment.

732
00:28:06,772 --> 00:28:09,122
He took a phone call,
and he left

733
00:28:09,165 --> 00:28:10,645
without a word
of explanation,

734
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:12,603
which was disrespectful,
at best.

735
00:28:12,647 --> 00:28:13,561
