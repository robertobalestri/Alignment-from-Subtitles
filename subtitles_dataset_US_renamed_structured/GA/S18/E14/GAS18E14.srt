I first met Fernanda and
her family in Boston last fall.

31
00:01:19,253 --> 00:01:21,603
She suffers from
congenital aortic valve disease,

32
00:01:21,646 --> 00:01:23,779
which led to aortic stenosis.

33
00:01:23,822 --> 00:01:28,436
At 13 years of age, she's
already had two heart surgeries.

35
00:01:30,046 --> 00:01:31,482

36
00:01:31,526 --> 00:01:33,571
We're doing

00:01:33,615 --> 00:01:35,269
Only seven programs
in the country

38
00:01:35,312 --> 00:01:36,922
perform Ross procedures,

39
00:01:36,966 --> 00:01:39,490

Helm.

42
00:01:44,365 --> 00:01:47,107
Uh, it's taking
a patient's pulmonary valve

43
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:49,631
and moving it into the position
of their aortic valve,

44
00:01:49,674 --> 00:01:53,330
preventing the need for
lifelong anticoagulant therapy.

45
00:01:53,374 --> 00:01:55,115
Exactly.

46
00:01:55,158 --> 00:01:58,161
It also has the added benefit
for pediatric patients --

47
00:01:58,205 --> 00:02:01,382
since it is their own valve,
it will grow with them.

48
00:02:01,425 --> 00:02:04,385
And on a pediatric patient,
it's even more challenging.

49
00:02:04,428 --> 00:02:07,692
Dr. Pierce is one of only
a few surgeons in the country

50
00:02:07,736 --> 00:02:09,520
who have done this
successfully.

51
00:02:09,564 --> 00:02:12,132

with me today,

52
00:02:12,175 --> 00:02:14,743

Hi, Dr. Maggie.
Hi, everyone.

- Hi.
- Hello.
- Hey.

57
00:02:27,582 --> 00:02:29,714

left it unsafe

on a commercial plane,

59
00:02:31,325 --> 00:02:33,979

have been driving

60
00:02:34,023 --> 00:02:36,199
all the way across the country
from Boston.

61
00:02:36,243 --> 00:02:39,376

00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,639

64
00:02:46,949 --> 00:02:48,646

707
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:16,390

do I need to page Altman?

708

Whatever's going on
with your brother --

709
00:28:17,826 --> 00:28:21,264
When my mom had cancer,
Wendell and my dad,

710
00:28:21,308 --> 00:28:24,398
they flipped out
on the outside.

711
00:28:24,441 --> 00:28:27,575
Wendell would get into fights
with anyone who crossed him.

712
00:28:27,618 --> 00:28:33,407
And my dad drank
and just threw away money.

713
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:36,018
And he landed in jail
a few times.

714
00:28:36,062 --> 00:28:39,456
And even after everything
he put us through

715
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:40,414
over the years,

716
00:28:40,457 --> 00:28:42,329
Mom forgave him.

717
00:28:43,547 --> 00:28:47,638
And she would use her money
for her treatment

718
00:28:47,682 --> 00:28:49,858
to bail him out.

719
00:28:49,902 --> 00:28:53,427
And because Mom had cancer,
I was also freaking out.

720
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:55,951
Just on the inside.

721
00:28:55,995 --> 00:28:57,474

722
00:28:57,518 --> 00:28:59,259
