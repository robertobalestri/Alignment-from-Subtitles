Uh...

181
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:43,446
Meredith is stuck
in Minnesota.

182
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:45,883
Snowstorm,
no flights out.

183
00:06:45,927 --> 00:06:48,277
Um, same with Maggie and Winston
in Boston.

184
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,278
Climate whiplash.

00:06:49,321 --> 00:06:50,845
Oh. So you're...

186

Oh, it's fine.

00:06:57,765 --> 00:06:58,896
You don't have to
change your plans.

189
00:06:58,940 --> 00:06:59,897
My plans?
What should I do --

190
00:06:59,941 --> 00:07:01,725
reschedule my dinner
at home alone

191
00:07:01,769 --> 00:07:04,336

marathon?

192

You, uh -- You were gonna
spend today alone?

193
00:07:07,122 --> 00:07:09,167
Jo, uh, didn't even realize
it was Thanksgiving,

194
00:07:09,211 --> 00:07:11,518
so she took a shift,
and, uh,

195
00:07:11,561 --> 00:07:14,912
Scout was gonna be here
with you, so...

196
00:07:14,956 --> 00:07:16,392
And I do not want to
become my parents

197
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,786
and make Scout shuffle

and dessert with me
on the holidays, so...

199

May as well figure out
how to do this now.

00:07:29,405 --> 00:07:30,580
You're also terrified

00:07:30,624 --> 00:07:32,060

We're checking right now.

00:07:53,951 --> 00:07:55,344
How long have you been
having pain for?

212
00:07:55,387 --> 00:07:57,520
Oh, I don't know.
A few days? A week?

I've got four kids
at home already,

my in-laws are in town
on open-ended tickets,

217

and everyone's always hungry
or out of toilet paper

get on the Wi-Fi.

heartburn from the pregnancy.

Heartburn can cause pain

Baby is fine.
Fetal heart rate is stable.

222

Still no sign
of contractions.

223
00:08:16,887 --> 00:08:20,630
I'm seeing free fluid
in the right upper quadrant.

Ashley, I don't want to expose
your baby to any radiation

with a CT scan,
but we can do an MRI.

It's safe?
Yes.

Okay. So my first Thanksgiving
as a resident,

260
00:09:43,234 --> 00:09:45,715
I'm working the ER when
two drunk brothers come in

261
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:47,630
after fighting over
who's gonna cut the turkey.

262
00:09:47,674 --> 00:09:49,240
And one of them stabbed
the other one.

263
00:09:49,284 --> 00:09:51,634
Close. Younger brother tried to
grab the knife,

264
00:09:51,678 --> 00:09:53,157
which caused older brother

265
00:09:53,201 --> 00:09:55,246
to completely slice off
his index finger.

266
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:56,465
Of course.

267
00:09:56,508 --> 00:09:57,858
We asked him if they
brought the finger in

268
00:09:57,901 --> 00:09:59,163
so we could try
re-attaching it,

269
00:09:59,207 --> 00:10:00,948
but they said
they couldn't find it.

270
00:10:00,991 --> 00:10:02,645
Naturally.
So we sewed him up,

271
00:10:02,689 --> 00:10:04,560
we admitted him
for observation,

272
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,040
until a few hours later,

273
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:08,520
younger brother comes
right back in with the finger.

274
00:10:08,564 --> 00:10:10,871
Oh, no. Where was it?

275
00:10:10,914 --> 00:10:12,481
Gravy bowl.
Ugh!

276
00:10:12,524 --> 00:10:15,397
They found it when Grandpa
ladled it onto his turkey.

277
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,659
No!

278
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:19,357

285
00:10:28,192 --> 00:10:30,194
Bagger at a grocery store.
Passed out on the job.

286
00:10:30,238 --> 00:10:32,457
Hypoxic and tachypneic.
What -- you know him?

287
00:10:32,501 --> 00:10:33,676
I treated him

288

Pulmonary fibrosis.

Oh, I want to play
a different game!

303
00:11:07,754 --> 00:11:09,059
That's just because
I'm winning.

304
00:11:09,103 --> 00:11:10,234
No, it's just because
you're winning --

305

You forgot the two hotels.
Like that!

306
00:11:11,845 --> 00:11:13,020
Still better than playing
with Owen.

307
00:11:13,063 --> 00:11:14,499
When he was little
and he didn't win,

308
00:11:14,543 --> 00:11:15,762
he would punch the wall.

309
00:11:15,805 --> 00:11:16,980
I'll let you in on
a little secret.

310
00:11:17,024 --> 00:11:18,678
Right after
my boys' mom died,

311
00:11:18,721 --> 00:11:20,723
we used to make Friday night
our weekly games night,

312
00:11:20,767 --> 00:11:23,247
and the winner got to pick
next week's pizza toppings.

313
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:25,772
Now, my boys love Hawaiian.
I can't stand fruit on a pizza.

314
00:11:25,815 --> 00:11:26,773
That's disgusting.

315
00:11:26,816 --> 00:11:28,165
It is.
It's an abomination.

316
00:11:28,209 --> 00:11:29,906
So I had to develop a pretty
good strategy, you know?

317
00:11:32,082 --> 00:11:33,257
What?

318
00:11:33,301 --> 00:11:36,173
I'm sorry, um --
did you say "games" night?

319
00:11:36,217 --> 00:11:37,566
With an "s"?
Yeah, games night.

320
00:11:37,609 --> 00:11:38,741
You know,
when the family gets together

321
00:11:38,785 --> 00:11:40,264
and play
a bunch of games?

322
00:11:40,308 --> 00:11:41,962
I know what gamenight is.
Game night. Singular.

323
00:11:42,005 --> 00:11:43,137
We played more than
one game.

324
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:44,181
It's still called
game night.

325
00:11:44,225 --> 00:11:45,356
Respectfully disagree.

326
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,531
Uh-oh.

327
00:11:48,969 --> 00:11:50,710

I know it hurts, okay?

328
00:11:50,753 --> 00:11:52,015
Do we have the films?

329
00:11:56,237 --> 00:11:57,804
Pneumo.
He's gonna need a chest tube,

330
00:11:57,847 --> 00:11:59,240
breathing treatment,
and steroids.

331
00:11:59,283 --> 00:12:01,372
Noah, I'm here.
Danny and I are here.

332
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:02,417
We came
as fast as we could.

333
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:04,158
No. Hey,
Danny shouldn't be here.

334
00:12:04,201 --> 00:12:05,376
Honey, it's okay.

335
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,856
Is he okay?

336
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,249
Um...

337
00:12:08,292 --> 00:12:09,990
His lung collapsed,
so we're gonna need to

338
00:12:10,033 --> 00:12:11,208
insert a chest tube.

339
00:12:11,252 --> 00:12:13,471
I'm also gonna run
some additional tests

340
00:12:13,515 --> 00:12:14,646
to rule out infection.

341
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:16,213
Danny, I'm sorry.

342
00:12:16,257 --> 00:12:19,782
We'll still make
the apple pie, okay?

343
00:12:19,826 --> 00:12:21,175
I got all the ingredients.

344
00:12:21,218 --> 00:12:23,220

Yeah?
