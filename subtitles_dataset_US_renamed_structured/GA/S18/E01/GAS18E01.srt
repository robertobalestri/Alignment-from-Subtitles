I wanna call in,
but not for that.

Ooh. Ahh.
Ooh, ooh,

00:02:44,773 --> 00:02:47,036
Still hurts?
Yeah, a little.

56
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:48,907
I told Bailey
not to schedule me in the OR

57
00:02:48,951 --> 00:02:50,039
for the next
couple of days.

58
00:02:50,082 --> 00:02:51,388
Did you tell her
how it happened?

59
00:02:55,827 --> 00:02:57,612
Are you married,
doctor?

60
00:02:57,655 --> 00:03:00,528
I am, but I'm not sure
that --People get married.

61
00:03:00,571 --> 00:03:02,747
It's what they do.
"People get married"?

62
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:04,053
A lot of them.

63
00:03:04,096 --> 00:03:06,229
A lot of people do drugs.
Should I?

64
00:03:06,273 --> 00:03:08,536
I gave you space,
I gave you time,

65
00:03:08,579 --> 00:03:11,278
and then -- then I planned
an extremely special thing.

66
00:03:11,321 --> 00:03:12,453
At someone else's wedding.

67
00:03:12,496 --> 00:03:13,541
Is that a rule
I didn't know about?

68
00:03:13,584 --> 00:03:14,933
Yes.
I --

69
00:03:14,977 --> 00:03:17,109
You ambushed me
with multiple children

70
00:03:17,153 --> 00:03:18,415
and multiple rings,

71
00:03:18,459 --> 00:03:20,417
the children making it
nearly impossible

72
00:03:20,461 --> 00:03:21,636
to say no to the rings.

73
00:03:21,679 --> 00:03:22,985
And somehow
you managed it.

74
00:03:23,028 --> 00:03:24,682
Because it felt
manipulative.

75
00:03:24,726 --> 00:03:28,120
Got it. So the proposal
was the problem.

76
00:03:28,164 --> 00:03:29,905
Why is your only option
marriage?

77
00:03:29,948 --> 00:03:31,298
It's archaic,
and it really only

78
00:03:31,341 --> 00:03:32,908
gets you tax deductions.
If that.

79
00:03:32,951 --> 00:03:35,780
If I may, I'd like to
get us back on track

80
00:03:35,824 --> 00:03:38,348
on why we're here.

81
00:03:38,392 --> 00:03:41,046
We seem to be hitting
all our one-year milestones.

82
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:42,831
How are his bowel movements?

83
00:03:44,093 --> 00:03:46,313
Poops like a champ.

84
00:03:46,356 --> 00:03:49,751
"Poops like a champ."
Okay. And his sleep?

85
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,799
And, sir, since you feel the
need to drink from that helmet,

86
00:03:54,843 --> 00:03:55,887
you'll need to leave.

87
00:03:55,931 --> 00:03:57,541
This is a hospital.

88
00:03:57,585 --> 00:03:59,413

And mine --
they seem to be struggling.

103
00:04:33,621 --> 00:04:34,926

enough time

104

before the pandemic, and --

105
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,976
and my youngest, Austin,
he, um...

106
00:04:41,019 --> 00:04:43,152
Well, he's having
these moments where, uh...

107
00:04:45,241 --> 00:04:48,026
He needs friends.

108
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:49,158
I mean,
we all do, right?

109
00:04:49,201 --> 00:04:51,595
Well, uh, I'd --

110
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:54,076
Well, I'll have to,
you know, talk to Ben,

111
00:04:54,119 --> 00:04:56,818
and the boys' --
uh, you know,

112
00:04:56,861 --> 00:04:59,342
their schedules are so
unpredictable, but --You know what?
For-- Forget it.

113

Remember that?

prized tumor guy.

from the trauma.

congenital,
