opening up her abdomen

423

"just" Braxton Hicks

535
00:19:02,184 --> 00:19:03,490
as though they
don't actually hurt.

536
00:19:03,533 --> 00:19:04,795
I know. I'm sorry.

537
00:19:04,839 --> 00:19:06,101
Doctors are the worst.

538
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,189
Excuse me?

539
00:19:07,233 --> 00:19:09,365
Stop hovering.
Mind your business.

540
00:19:09,409 --> 00:19:10,845
Come over here.

541
00:19:10,888 --> 00:19:12,194
Thank you. We really
appreciate you taking a look.

542
00:19:12,238 --> 00:19:13,674
Of course.

543
00:19:13,717 --> 00:19:16,198
I do want to take you to OB
triage, do a cervical exam,

544
00:19:16,242 --> 00:19:18,113
and to monitor you
just for a bit in case.

545
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,071
And we can see how the baby's
doing with the contractions.

546
00:19:20,115 --> 00:19:23,292
No, no.
I-I can't leave Simon.

547
00:19:23,336 --> 00:19:25,642
You'll just be upstairs,
and we can page if any...

548
00:19:25,686 --> 00:19:28,123
Please.
I don't want to be alone.

549
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,864
- Hey.
- Richard, take her up.

550
00:19:29,907 --> 00:19:31,866
You've been cooped up here
all night long.

551
00:19:31,909 --> 00:19:34,869
Simon will keep me company,
and you and Kristen

552
00:19:34,912 --> 00:19:38,046
can go somewhere
where there are no puzzles.

553
00:19:38,089 --> 00:19:39,656
Please, babe.

554
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:41,136
I don't want
you hurting, too.

555
00:19:42,485 --> 00:19:44,313
Okay.
Okay.

556
00:19:44,357 --> 00:19:45,445
Come with me.

557
00:19:45,488 --> 00:19:48,883
I'll be fine.
I promise.
Okay.

558
00:19:48,926 --> 00:19:51,451
This way.Promise.

559
00:19:51,494 --> 00:19:53,453
Dr. Williams to Radiology.

560
00:19:53,496 --> 00:19:55,890
Dr. Sandra Williams
to Radiology.

561
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:02,810
So, uh, Nick, what's
your favorite place

562
00:20:02,853 --> 00:20:04,420
to do a transplant?

563
00:20:04,464 --> 00:20:05,813
Oh, um, well,

564
00:20:05,856 --> 00:20:08,119
I put a pig's kidney on
a man's groin the other day.

565
00:20:08,163 --> 00:20:09,599
That was pretty fun.

566
00:20:09,643 --> 00:20:12,036
Uh, no.
Probably San Diego.

567
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,864
It doesn't matter when you get
off work, you can always find...

568
00:20:13,908 --> 00:20:15,301
Tacos.
...tacos.

569
00:20:15,344 --> 00:20:16,519
Yes.

570
00:20:16,563 --> 00:20:17,999
Uh, I did a rotation
there in med school.

571
00:20:18,042 --> 00:20:19,043
UC San Diego?

572
00:20:19,087 --> 00:20:20,219
G.I. Department.

573
00:20:20,262 --> 00:20:22,090
Under Ned Powell.
Ooh, Ned Powell.

574
00:20:22,133 --> 00:20:24,048
Incredible surgeon.
Terrible at cards.

575
00:20:24,092 --> 00:20:25,441
Uh, what about,
uh, board games?

576
00:20:25,485 --> 00:20:27,443
The people in this house
are fiercely competitive.

577
00:20:27,487 --> 00:20:29,532
Depends.

578
00:20:29,576 --> 00:20:30,403
Alright.
What about Scrabble?

579
00:20:30,446 --> 00:20:31,926
Sure.

580
00:20:31,969 --> 00:20:33,232
I mean, you know, that game
isn't so much about

581
00:20:33,275 --> 00:20:34,581
the vocabulary
as the math.

582
00:20:34,624 --> 00:20:36,800
Yeah, long, brainy words

583
00:20:36,844 --> 00:20:38,846
made up of one-point
A's, T's, and R's

584
00:20:38,889 --> 00:20:41,065
aren't nearly as good
as words like "X-ray."

585
00:20:41,109 --> 00:20:43,372
Yes, with the "X" on
a triple letter score.

586
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:44,504
Correct.

587
00:20:44,547 --> 00:20:45,418
Ever try
cryptic crosswords?

588
00:20:45,461 --> 00:20:46,419
No.

589
00:20:46,462 --> 00:20:48,290
How 'bout Boggle?

590
00:20:48,334 --> 00:20:50,031
Uh...

591
00:20:51,685 --> 00:20:53,817
You know, I always wanted one
of these when I was a kid.

592
00:20:53,861 --> 00:20:55,602
I liked
the Y-shaped pieces...

593
00:20:55,645 --> 00:20:57,430
the idea that you could veer
off the main course

594
00:20:57,473 --> 00:20:58,779
but still be on track
intrigued me.

595
00:20:58,822 --> 00:21:00,302
Huh.

596
00:21:00,346 --> 00:21:02,086
You know, I-I just
thought trains were cool.

597
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:05,829
I'm supposed to remind you there
are hiding people out there

598
00:21:05,873 --> 00:21:06,787
waiting for you
to seek them.

599
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:08,179
Oh, yes. Okay.

600
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:10,704
Scout?
Oh, he's upstairs with Amelia.

601
00:21:10,747 --> 00:21:12,488
Okay, good.
Coming!

602
00:21:12,532 --> 00:21:15,056
And after ten years of
studying...

603
00:21:17,014 --> 00:21:18,494
You having
your own party up here?

604
00:21:18,538 --> 00:21:20,104
Yeah.

605
00:21:20,148 --> 00:21:21,802
He's almost settled.

606
00:21:21,845 --> 00:21:23,369
Oh. You want me
to take him?

607
00:21:23,412 --> 00:21:25,501
Hm.
I could be the closer.

608
00:21:25,545 --> 00:21:26,937
I'm pretty boring.

609
00:21:26,981 --> 00:21:28,939
I got him.

610
00:21:28,983 --> 00:21:30,419
I really don't mind.

611
00:21:30,463 --> 00:21:32,116
And you have a date.

612
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,466
Hmm.

613
00:21:33,509 --> 00:21:35,729
It's okay.

614
00:21:35,772 --> 00:21:36,991
But thank you.

615
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:39,602
Mm.

616
00:21:39,646 --> 00:21:43,171
"...patients with inoperable
plexiform neurofibromas

617
00:21:43,214 --> 00:21:45,608

tumor shrinkage... "

618
00:21:45,652 --> 00:21:47,523
Are you reading
a medical journal?

619
00:21:49,046 --> 00:21:51,397
I can be boring, too.

620
00:21:53,007 --> 00:21:55,270
"How does this nomogram
correlate with survival..."

621
00:21:58,099 --> 00:21:59,970
Hey.
Who was on the phone?

622
00:22:00,014 --> 00:22:01,276
No one.

623
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,582
Uh,
is dinner ready?

624
00:22:04,235 --> 00:22:06,890
Uh... Wendell.

625
00:22:06,934 --> 00:22:09,110
Hey, uh, I-I don't
think you should stay.

626
00:22:09,153 --> 00:22:10,764
Alright, um, I'll pack up
some food for you,

627
00:22:10,807 --> 00:22:11,721
but then you should
go back to the hotel.

628
00:22:11,765 --> 00:22:13,027
Alright?
Look.

629
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:16,030
The people that I owe...

630
00:22:16,073 --> 00:22:18,206
they're not good people.

631
00:22:18,249 --> 00:22:19,642
They know you're here
in Seattle?

632
00:22:19,686 --> 00:22:22,210
Yes.
Wendell.

633
00:22:22,253 --> 00:22:24,647
But that's why I need to
disappear for a while.

634
00:22:24,691 --> 00:22:26,432
Look, I just wanted
to spend one more night

635
00:22:26,475 --> 00:22:28,390
with my big brother.
Hm.

636
00:22:28,434 --> 00:22:30,784
And ask for some cash.

637
00:22:30,827 --> 00:22:31,785
Look, I'll pay you back
in a month...

638
00:22:31,828 --> 00:22:33,003
You've gotta be
kidding me.

639
00:22:33,047 --> 00:22:34,396
No, i-it's not a lot.
J-Just enough...

640
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,789
These people know where you are
and you came here?

641
00:22:35,832 --> 00:22:37,268
You came to
this house?

642
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:38,792
Nobody's following me,
if that's what you mean.

643
00:22:38,835 --> 00:22:39,706
Do you know that
for sure?

644
00:22:39,749 --> 00:22:40,968
No, but...

645
00:22:41,011 --> 00:22:41,969
There are children here,
Wendell!

646
00:22:42,012 --> 00:22:43,492
Winston, calm down.

647
00:22:44,928 --> 00:22:45,799
You're putting
my family at risk.

648
00:22:45,842 --> 00:22:47,409

Why, are you trying to unload
one of yours on me?

671
00:23:41,985 --> 00:23:45,162
No, it's just... you kind
of sound like Amelia,

672
00:23:45,206 --> 00:23:47,382
before she had Scout.

673
00:23:51,517 --> 00:23:55,651
I finally sold
the last one last week.

674
00:23:55,695 --> 00:23:58,349
Poor guy dropped
his first ring in the Sound

675
00:23:58,393 --> 00:24:00,134
while he was proposing.
Mm.

676
00:24:00,177 --> 00:24:02,136
I gave him a good deal.

677
00:24:02,179 --> 00:24:03,790
Why'd you buy so many?

678
00:24:05,095 --> 00:24:07,794
I-I used to ask myself
that a lot.

679
00:24:07,837 --> 00:24:09,578
None of the answers
made sense,

680
00:24:09,622 --> 00:24:11,928
so I just tried
to move past it.

681
00:24:11,972 --> 00:24:13,974
How'd that work out?

682
00:24:14,017 --> 00:24:15,802
Um...

683
00:24:15,845 --> 00:24:17,978
I burned my relationship
with Amelia to the ground.

684
00:24:18,021 --> 00:24:19,458
I trashed
my friendship with Jo.

685
00:24:19,501 --> 00:24:21,590
So...not great.

686
00:24:21,634 --> 00:24:23,287
Is it 'cause
you slept together?

687
00:24:23,331 --> 00:24:25,594
I don't regret Scout,
if that's what you mean.

688
00:24:25,638 --> 00:24:27,727
Not Amelia.
Jo.

689
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:29,598
She told you?

690
00:24:29,642 --> 00:24:31,121
Well, we were drinking.

691
00:24:31,165 --> 00:24:33,384
You say things
when you're drinking.

692
00:24:33,428 --> 00:24:35,212
Did she mention
anything about feelings?

693
00:24:35,256 --> 00:24:37,345
'Cause, apparently,
there were some feelings.

694
00:24:37,388 --> 00:24:38,564
There are
no longer feelings?

695
00:24:38,607 --> 00:24:40,043
Now there's Todd.
Oh.

696
00:24:40,087 --> 00:24:42,611
I-I hardly
see her anymore.

697
00:24:42,655 --> 00:24:44,526
I miss my friend.

698
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:46,746
But, you know,
I want her to be happy.

699
00:24:46,789 --> 00:24:48,791
And she deserves
the best.

700
00:24:48,835 --> 00:24:50,619
Do you have
feelings for her?

701
00:24:51,751 --> 00:24:53,753
Sometimes.

702
00:24:53,796 --> 00:24:55,537
Maybe, a little.

703
00:24:55,581 --> 00:24:56,886
I'm...

704
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:58,322
Should I tell her?

705
00:24:58,366 --> 00:25:00,411
That you maybe have
occasional small feelings?

706
00:25:00,455 --> 00:25:01,500
No.

707
00:25:01,543 --> 00:25:03,197
Okay, good.

708
00:25:08,855 --> 00:25:10,596
The food was delicious.

709
00:25:10,639 --> 00:25:13,599
But this seems like way
more plates than people.

710
00:25:13,642 --> 00:25:15,557
Well, three of those are
the other Bailey's.

711
00:25:15,601 --> 00:25:17,472
He doesn't like
his food to touch.

712
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:20,431
You have cooked and cleaned,
