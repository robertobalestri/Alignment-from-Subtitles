I'll start on
your burst fracture,

299

will start in

300

The other way around.

301
00:13:54,964 --> 00:13:56,966
Femoral fracture first,
then spine.

302
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:58,663
We always start
with the spine.

303
00:13:58,707 --> 00:13:59,795
Yes, when the spinal fracture's
more unstable

304
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,753

shattered with an open wound

and he has decreased
PT and DP pulses,

307
00:14:06,671 --> 00:14:08,238
so it takes priority
if he wants to keep it.

308

actually compromise here.

309

00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:57,017
collapsed on the side of
the street, unable to move.

527
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:58,888
I get it.
I know how you feel.

528
00:24:58,932 --> 00:25:01,456
But you have to stop, okay?

529
00:25:05,634 --> 00:25:07,593
Um, listen.

530
00:25:07,636 --> 00:25:09,420
Step back.

531
00:25:09,464 --> 00:25:12,511
Look, um...
It's gonna be okay.

532
00:25:12,554 --> 00:25:14,208
You have to
step back, though.

533
00:25:14,251 --> 00:25:16,253
And the water
will turn off.

534
00:25:16,297 --> 00:25:17,864
Just step back.

535
00:25:17,907 --> 00:25:19,300
I've got you, buddy.
It's alright.

536
00:25:19,343 --> 00:25:20,562
- No!
- It's alright. It's alright.

537
00:25:20,606 --> 00:25:22,651

548
00:25:52,202 --> 00:25:53,595

551
00:25:57,294 --> 00:25:59,035
Dr. Rymock,
call the Psych Unit.

552
00:26:00,733 --> 00:26:02,517
You spent the day
punishing me

553
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:04,388
because you saw me
kissing someone else?

554
00:26:04,432 --> 00:26:06,913
You brought all of that --
all of that into Owen's surgery.

555
00:26:06,956 --> 00:26:09,132
You don't think maybe
a conversation

556
00:26:09,176 --> 00:26:10,743
before we're cutting into
someone I love?

557
00:26:10,786 --> 00:26:13,615
Are you kidding me?
You think you get to be upset?

558
00:26:13,659 --> 00:26:15,182
Are you serious?!

559
00:26:15,225 --> 00:26:17,967
I'm over here
pining for you, Amelia,

560
00:26:18,011 --> 00:26:20,622
head-over-heels,
can't-think-straight pining,

561
00:26:20,666 --> 00:26:21,971
because you told me
you loved me.

562
00:26:22,015 --> 00:26:24,713
You told me
over and over and over.

563
00:26:24,757 --> 00:26:25,888
We were building a life
together,

564
00:26:25,932 --> 00:26:27,890
and suddenly, you say,
"No, thanks."

565
00:26:27,934 --> 00:26:30,153
And while I'm torturing myself
trying to convince myself

566
00:26:30,197 --> 00:26:31,981
that I don't need to be married,
I just need you.

567
00:26:32,025 --> 00:26:34,897
Since when?
Since now. Since today.

568
00:26:34,941 --> 00:26:37,813
And I came to tell you this,
but instead, I find you

569
00:26:37,857 --> 00:26:41,164
kissing someone else
in the hospital where I work!

570
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:45,342
You -- You just moved on.

571
00:26:45,386 --> 00:26:47,170
You just --
You just moved on

572
00:26:47,214 --> 00:26:48,650
like the last year and a half
didn't matter.

573
00:26:48,694 --> 00:26:50,521
Okay. I am not a person
who just moves on.

574
00:26:50,565 --> 00:26:52,654
I had to think and process

575
00:26:52,698 --> 00:26:54,308
and go through
every scenario in my head

576
00:26:54,351 --> 00:26:56,527
and every feeling in my body,
and it was exhausting.

577
00:26:56,571 --> 00:26:58,529
And you know that I spent
a year in A.A. meetings

578
00:26:58,573 --> 00:27:00,140
trying to figure out
what I needed,

579
00:27:00,183 --> 00:27:03,796
and you did not want to hear
that I was losing myself

580
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:08,627
in something that I did not --
that I could not want.

581
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:12,892
You demanded
that I marry you,

582
00:27:12,935 --> 00:27:14,589
and now once again,
you want to gaslight me

583
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:16,765

that I played you?

584
00:27:21,248 --> 00:27:25,208

"gaslight."
