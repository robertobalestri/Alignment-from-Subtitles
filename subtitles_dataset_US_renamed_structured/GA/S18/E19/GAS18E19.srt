How are you?
Today should be

359
00:14:01,623 --> 00:14:03,625
one of the biggest
celebratory days of my career.

360
00:14:03,668 --> 00:14:05,105
Our article was published.

361
00:14:05,148 --> 00:14:06,889
I might have gotten
one step closer

362
00:14:06,933 --> 00:14:09,283
to surgically curing
Parkinson's disease.

363
00:14:09,326 --> 00:14:10,893
And all you can think about
is Kai.

364
00:14:10,937 --> 00:14:11,981
Have you heard from them?

365
00:14:12,025 --> 00:14:13,417
They texted,
"Thinking of you."

366
00:14:13,461 --> 00:14:15,724
Which is sweet,
but does nothing to soothe

367
00:14:15,767 --> 00:14:19,293
the intense ache
that is consuming my body.

368
00:14:19,336 --> 00:14:20,294
Breakups are hard.

369
00:14:20,337 --> 00:14:22,687
Give it time.

370
00:14:22,731 --> 00:14:24,298
Has Winston heard
from his brother?

371
00:14:24,341 --> 00:14:26,039
No.

372
00:14:26,082 --> 00:14:28,389
And, uh, he's mildly obsessing.

373
00:14:28,432 --> 00:14:29,477
No... not mildly.

374
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,087
He is obsessing.

375
00:14:31,131 --> 00:14:32,872
And this morning I tried
to get him to let it go,

376
00:14:32,915 --> 00:14:34,482
and he responded by telling me
I don't know what it's like

377
00:14:34,525 --> 00:14:37,398
to have siblings.
Mm.

378
00:14:37,441 --> 00:14:38,529
What?
You agree with him?

379
00:14:38,573 --> 00:14:39,966
It's just...

380
00:14:40,009 --> 00:14:40,923
No, it's just, it's different.

381
00:14:40,967 --> 00:14:42,229
I mean, you and I are sisters

382
00:14:42,272 --> 00:14:45,188
in like the best
and most adult ways,

383
00:14:45,232 --> 00:14:47,495
and I love you.

384
00:14:47,538 --> 00:14:49,018
But my Shepherd sisters?

385
00:14:49,062 --> 00:14:51,020
When they get under my skin,
I cannot get them out,

386
00:14:51,064 --> 00:14:52,543
and I love them,

387
00:14:52,587 --> 00:14:54,197
but I'm not sure
that I like them.

388
00:14:54,241 --> 00:14:56,634
And that is just based in,
like, childhood stuff.

389
00:14:56,678 --> 00:14:57,853
So you agree with him.

390
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:58,985
I'm saying,

391
00:14:59,028 --> 00:15:00,812
don't try to help him
stop obsessing.

392
00:15:00,856 --> 00:15:02,292
It is only gonna make him
obsess more.

393
00:15:02,336 --> 00:15:05,034
Here I thought I knew my husband
inside and out,

394
00:15:05,078 --> 00:15:08,168
and there's just a lo...
I mean...

395
00:15:08,211 --> 00:15:11,301
Deep things, like this thing
with his brother.

396
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,087
A lot of stuff
I didn't anticipate,

397
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:16,785
a lot of stuff that
I-I don't know.

398
00:15:24,445 --> 00:15:27,491
Hey. I, uh...
I heard about Simon.

399
00:15:27,535 --> 00:15:29,363
You okay?

400
00:15:29,406 --> 00:15:31,931
I'm just trying
to distract myself

401
00:15:31,974 --> 00:15:33,802
from thinking about
all the terrible things

402
00:15:33,845 --> 00:15:36,848
that are gonna appear
on this screen in two minutes.

404
00:15:39,634 --> 00:15:41,984
Really? You're thinking
about Todd right now?

405
00:15:42,028 --> 00:15:45,857
No, I'm thinking about how
I wish we had gone to karaoke

406
00:15:45,901 --> 00:15:47,294

went out drinking.

407

He's nice.
He's kind.

409
00:15:52,168 --> 00:15:54,910
But he is also obsessed
with his own PhD,

410
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:58,479
and he narrates his life
out loud.

411

I'm making the coffee.

I'm putting the beans
in the filter.

What if we resect
her entire pancreas,

427
00:16:34,297 --> 00:16:35,603
extract the islet cells,

428
00:16:35,646 --> 00:16:36,821
and insert them into her liver

429
00:16:36,865 --> 00:16:39,041

to just get in there

436
00:16:53,403 --> 00:16:56,145
and cut around the tumor
a little bit at a time,

437
00:16:56,189 --> 00:16:57,842
piece by piece.

00:16:57,886 --> 00:17:00,584
But how do we do that during
a critical blood shortage?

439
00:17:00,628 --> 00:17:02,804
Wait, she would lose
a lot less blood

440
00:17:02,847 --> 00:17:04,980
if we didn't do the surgery
inside the body.

441

You want to do
an ex-vivo surgery?

Right.

to go that route,

445
00:17:12,553 --> 00:17:16,078
it would be helpful to have
an extra set of hands.

446
00:17:16,122 --> 00:17:18,211
So, basically,
you want to do a Whipple,

447
00:17:18,254 --> 00:17:21,257
but outside the body
on the back O.R. table?

448
00:17:21,301 --> 00:17:24,130
Exactly.
Remove everything involved...

449
00:17:24,173 --> 00:17:25,566
the liver,

450
00:17:25,609 --> 00:17:26,741

excise the tumor,

back into Cora's body.

455
00:17:33,704 --> 00:17:35,532

Does it matter?

No, it doesn't,

I mean, it's too risky,

and, frankly, today,
it's irresponsible.

460

would take over 20 hours.

maybe it's cutting edge.

By making your residents
donate blood during a shift?

out of his body

533
00:20:54,905 --> 00:20:58,387
Kristen, ECMO comes
with its own complications.

534
00:20:58,431 --> 00:21:01,434
Particularly, it comes
with the risk of blood clots.

535
00:21:01,477 --> 00:21:03,871

536
00:21:03,914 --> 00:21:05,525

537
00:21:05,568 --> 00:21:07,744
Kristen, we usually use ECMO
on patients

538
00:21:07,788 --> 00:21:11,357
so that their heart and lungs
can rest and recover.

539
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,837
And Simon's lungs
are not going to recover.

540
00:21:13,881 --> 00:21:16,362
So what worries me about
using ECMO in this case

541
00:21:16,405 --> 00:21:17,537
is that at some point...

00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:18,886
