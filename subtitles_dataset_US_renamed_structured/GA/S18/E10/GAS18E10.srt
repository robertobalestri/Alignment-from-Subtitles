141
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,219
If Dr. Schmitt was
the primary surgeon

142
00:06:34,263 --> 00:06:37,005
and you're the attending,
who's in charge?

143
00:06:37,048 --> 00:06:39,921
The Webber Method dictates
that a resident cannot go on

144
00:06:39,964 --> 00:06:41,313
to the next step
in the procedure

145
00:06:41,357 --> 00:06:42,750

being present.

146

Yeah, I-I understand

147
00:06:45,056 --> 00:06:46,971

the chain of command.

I beg your pardon?

149
00:06:48,495 --> 00:06:49,844
Well, I mean, the --
the Webber Method

150
00:06:49,887 --> 00:06:51,411
seems to rotate authority
during surgery

151
00:06:51,454 --> 00:06:53,021
depending on
which step you're on,

152
00:06:53,064 --> 00:06:55,937
which, with all due respect,
sir, seems...confusing.

153
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,591
Perhaps a little more time
in our program

154
00:06:57,634 --> 00:06:59,462
would help clear up
any confusion.

155
00:06:59,506 --> 00:07:01,029
Alright, let's get back
to the next question, please.

156
00:07:01,072 --> 00:07:02,726
In a Webber Method surgery,
can you just remind us

157
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:05,468
what exactly happens
if a complication arises,

158
00:07:05,512 --> 00:07:07,644
even if it's not at
the predetermined step

159
00:07:07,688 --> 00:07:09,646
when an attending
would need to be called?

160
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:11,169
Well, an attending
should be called anyway.

161
00:07:11,213 --> 00:07:13,476
Right, but for all
intents and purposes,

162
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,261
your method sets up
these senior residents

163
00:07:16,305 --> 00:07:18,263
as the attendings,
right?

164
00:07:18,307 --> 00:07:20,352
Didn't you specifically
use the word "attendings"

165
00:07:20,396 --> 00:07:22,746
when you first
introduced the method?

166
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:24,444
"Today you will be
the attendings."
...you will be the attendings.

167
00:07:24,487 --> 00:07:26,750
Welcome to the Webber Method.

168
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:33,235
Dr. Webber, was there ever
a meeting of department heads

169
00:07:33,278 --> 00:07:35,237
to discuss whether
we should adopt

170
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,457
this particular
teaching style?

171
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,023
Does that
make a difference?

172
00:07:39,067 --> 00:07:40,329
Well, yes, I mean,
we have meetings to discuss

173
00:07:40,372 --> 00:07:41,678
what brand of sutures
we're going to buy.

174
00:07:41,722 --> 00:07:43,158
Why not meet about this?

175
00:07:43,201 --> 00:07:44,986

Dr. Webber is your
chief medical officer, Dr. Fox.

178
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:50,905
The method's
named after him.

179
00:07:50,948 --> 00:07:52,515
You never considered
that there would be

180
00:07:52,559 --> 00:07:54,517
negative consequences
or a P.R. nightmare?

181
00:07:54,561 --> 00:07:56,867
Dr. Lin, you recently
promoted the Webber Method

182
00:07:56,911 --> 00:07:58,826
while recruiting
new residents.

183
00:07:58,869 --> 00:08:00,262
This is a teaching tool,
my dear,

184
00:08:00,305 --> 00:08:02,264
not some risky
cure for cancer.

185
00:08:02,307 --> 00:08:04,962
It's a teaching tool that
cost a patient their life.

186
00:08:05,006 --> 00:08:07,356
Dr. Bailey,
you initially

187
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:09,184
expressed reservations
about the method.

188
00:08:09,227 --> 00:08:10,707
What changed for you?

189
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:12,927
Is the M&M on the patient
or the Webber Method?

190
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:14,276
Because the method
didn't hold the scalpel.

191
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:15,973
Thank you.

192
00:08:16,017 --> 00:08:18,541
Well, there are clearly
residents who are not ready.

193
00:08:18,585 --> 00:08:20,717
What about
the American Board of Surgery?

194
00:08:20,761 --> 00:08:22,719
Have they sanctioned it?
Everybody, just please.

195
00:08:22,763 --> 00:08:24,808
Dr. Webber is just prioritizing
our education.

196
00:08:24,852 --> 00:08:27,158
- We're here to learn.
- Okay, everyone.

197
00:08:27,202 --> 00:08:28,551
Why would they weigh in on a
method for general procedure?

198
00:08:28,595 --> 00:08:30,684
We need to get back
to asking questions.

199
00:08:30,727 --> 00:08:31,728
- What they need to approve...
- This hospital...

200
00:08:31,772 --> 00:08:34,514
Here we go.

201
00:08:36,211 --> 00:08:37,386
How's the pain?

202
00:08:37,429 --> 00:08:38,300
It's okay.
It's not terrible.

203
00:08:38,343 --> 00:08:39,736
Good.

204
00:08:48,049 --> 00:08:49,703
Listen, Owen,

205
00:08:49,746 --> 00:08:51,487
I-I know that
you have gone through

206
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:54,316
something horrible,
and I've given it two days,

207
00:08:54,359 --> 00:08:55,839
but now I'm gonna
sit here until you tell me

208
00:08:55,883 --> 00:08:57,493
what the hell
is going on.

209
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:58,973
Noah's wife
has called the house

210
00:08:59,016 --> 00:09:00,191
several times
looking for you.

211
00:09:00,235 --> 00:09:01,758
Why?
Teddy --

212
00:09:01,802 --> 00:09:03,673
Owen, after everything
that we've been through,

213
00:09:03,717 --> 00:09:06,589
after 20 years,
I deserve the truth.

214
00:09:06,633 --> 00:09:08,809
What does Heather want?
Why did Hayes quit?

215
00:09:08,852 --> 00:09:11,072
I know that something
happened in the car.

216
00:09:11,115 --> 00:09:13,596
Can you just tell me,
please?

217
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:17,382
You're right.
Something happened in the car.

218
00:09:17,426 --> 00:09:19,776
But, Teddy, I'm asking you
to trust me.

219
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,256
I can't tell you.

220
00:09:23,911 --> 00:09:25,608
What about me?
Don't I deserve the same?

221
00:09:25,652 --> 00:09:27,088
Doesn't trust
go both ways?

222
00:09:27,131 --> 00:09:29,003
Of course, but --Owen, it's me.

223
00:09:29,046 --> 00:09:30,265
You can sit there as long
as you want, okay?

224
00:09:30,308 --> 00:09:31,266
But I'm not
gonna tell you.

225
00:09:32,528 --> 00:09:34,704
I love you.

226
00:09:34,748 --> 00:09:36,576
But I can't.

227
00:09:36,619 --> 00:09:37,925
You can.

228
00:09:37,968 --> 00:09:39,666
But you won't.

229
00:09:39,709 --> 00:09:42,146
Okay, I won't.

230
00:09:44,322 --> 00:09:48,022
♪♪

231
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:56,291
Legal hasn't heard anything
from the Gomez family.

232
00:09:56,334 --> 00:09:59,163
We may avoid a lawsuit
altogether.

233
00:09:59,207 --> 00:10:01,775
Hmm.
But you still have some
decisions to make.

234
00:10:01,818 --> 00:10:04,038
I have some
decisions to make?

235
00:10:04,081 --> 00:10:07,824
He's my husband, Dr. Bailey,
but this is your hospital.

236
00:10:07,868 --> 00:10:10,000
The method was successful

237
00:10:10,044 --> 00:10:11,872
as long as the residents
stuck to it.

238
00:10:11,915 --> 00:10:14,439
But surgical residents are
not known for their humility,

239
00:10:14,483 --> 00:10:16,790
so whether or not
the method continues on

240
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:20,402
after this suspension,
it's up to you.

241
00:10:20,445 --> 00:10:23,057
Dr. O'Dell to the ICU.
Dr. O'Dell...

242
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,407
Hey, ventral hernia's
repaired.

243
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:27,235
How was the M&M?

244
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:29,237
I want to check in on Richard
before my VIP's scans.

245
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,542
The M&M was awful.

246
00:10:30,586 --> 00:10:32,196
Richard needs space.

247
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,763
But I put you down for

248
00:10:33,807 --> 00:10:36,897
a Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy
in O.R. 4.

249
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:39,464
Oh, well, I've already
over-scheduled my own day.

250
00:10:39,508 --> 00:10:41,118
I want to help you,
but I can't --

251
00:10:41,162 --> 00:10:42,859
Look at my face.
This is a desperate face.

252
00:10:42,903 --> 00:10:44,905
This is
a-a begging face.

253
00:10:44,948 --> 00:10:46,471
I'm desperate
and I'm begging,

254
00:10:46,515 --> 00:10:48,604
and I'm asking for
your help, Grey.

255
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:52,521
Look, I'm down a trauma surgeon,
a cardio surgeon,

256
00:10:52,564 --> 00:10:54,697
a peds surgeon,
and now a resident

257
00:10:54,741 --> 00:10:57,047
'cause Schmitt walked out.

258
00:10:57,091 --> 00:10:59,746
And t-the rest of them
are so traumatized

259
00:10:59,789 --> 00:11:02,270
that they'll probably
need a safe space

260
00:11:02,313 --> 00:11:04,272
and a week off
to feel their feelings.

261
00:11:04,315 --> 00:11:07,144
Okay.
I can take the hepatico-J.

262
00:11:07,188 --> 00:11:08,842
And I know someone
who can do the hernia repair.

263
00:11:10,626 --> 00:11:12,367
Ideally, a surgeon.
Uh-huh.

264
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:12,976
Hi.

265
00:11:15,936 --> 00:11:17,328
Hey. You okay?

266
00:11:17,372 --> 00:11:19,548
You kinda went after
Richard in the M&M.

267
00:11:19,591 --> 00:11:20,941
I went after the method.

268
00:11:20,984 --> 00:11:22,899
Right, but the Webber Method
is Richard.

269
00:11:22,943 --> 00:11:24,684
Do you still stand by it?

270
00:11:24,727 --> 00:11:27,382
The Webber Method? After
everything that we just heard?

271
00:11:27,425 --> 00:11:29,645
We don't use it in
our department,

272
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,168
so I'm not really
sure that I can --

273
00:11:31,212 --> 00:11:33,649
I know that you respect Richard.
We all do.

274
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:36,086
It's why I wanted to speak
to him before the M&M.

275
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:38,306
Maggie, the method works.

276
00:11:38,349 --> 00:11:40,003
You just haven't
been around to see it.
Exactly.

277
00:11:40,047 --> 00:11:41,918
I haven't been around,
and I come back

278
00:11:41,962 --> 00:11:43,746
and Richard's new
teaching method

279
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:45,313
has gotten someone killed,

280
00:11:45,356 --> 00:11:47,924
and no one is being honest
with him about it.

281
00:11:47,968 --> 00:11:51,319
So, you respect him,
but I love him,

282
00:11:51,362 --> 00:11:53,800
so I'm gonna keep
telling him the truth.

283
00:11:53,843 --> 00:11:55,105
Okay?
Okay.

284
00:11:56,585 --> 00:11:58,543
I gotta take this.

285
00:11:58,587 --> 00:11:59,980
Alright.

286
00:12:04,071 --> 00:12:05,550
Thank you, Carla.

287
00:12:05,594 --> 00:12:08,510
Hey, um, have you
seen Levi anywhere?

288
00:12:08,553 --> 00:12:09,772
No one has seen him
since the M&M.

289
00:12:09,816 --> 00:12:11,992
No, I've been swamped
all morning.

290
00:12:12,035 --> 00:12:14,951
Oh, uh, I might have
a double arthroplasty later.

291
00:12:14,995 --> 00:12:16,518
You want in?

292
00:12:16,561 --> 00:12:19,826
Films show major scar tissue,
so it should be fun.

293
00:12:19,869 --> 00:12:21,349
Things better with
you and Shepherd?

294
00:12:21,392 --> 00:12:23,003
Uh, no.

295
00:12:23,046 --> 00:12:25,701
But...I feel great.

296
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:28,965
Dr. Burkes to oncology.
Dr. Burkes to oncology.

297
00:12:29,009 --> 00:12:30,532
Hello.

298
00:12:30,575 --> 00:12:32,186
I'm Dr. Lincoln.
What seems to be going on?

299
00:12:32,229 --> 00:12:33,622
Uh, Ms. Hanley.

300
00:12:33,665 --> 00:12:35,276
Second grade science teacher.

301
00:12:35,319 --> 00:12:36,494
Wish she had been mine.

302
00:12:36,538 --> 00:12:38,061
Please, call me Lila.

303
00:12:38,105 --> 00:12:40,107
Not even my students
call me Ms. Hanley.

304
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:42,413
Anyway, uh,
my leg's numbed up again.

305
00:12:42,457 --> 00:12:44,024
I've got shooting pains
right below the knee.

306
00:12:44,067 --> 00:12:46,113
But this time
when it happened,

307
00:12:46,156 --> 00:12:48,071
I barely made it down
the staircase at the IMAX.

308
00:12:48,115 --> 00:12:49,507
Northwest Science Center.

309
00:12:49,551 --> 00:12:51,118
We go every year
during winter camp.

310
00:12:51,161 --> 00:12:52,815
X-rays show
some minimal changes

311
00:12:52,859 --> 00:12:54,295
indicative
of osteoarthritis.

312
00:12:54,338 --> 00:12:55,818
Okay.
Uh, you said "this time."

313
00:12:55,862 --> 00:12:57,037
This has happened before?

314
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,603
It's happened
a couple times.

315
00:12:58,647 --> 00:13:00,040
Cortisone shot
usually does the trick,

316
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:01,824
but now my leg's
a little off.

317
00:13:01,868 --> 00:13:03,434
And no allergic reaction
to the cortisone?

318
00:13:03,478 --> 00:13:04,827
No.

319
00:13:04,871 --> 00:13:06,481
Okay.

320
00:13:06,524 --> 00:13:08,004
Perez here will do
a work-up on your knee,

321
00:13:08,048 --> 00:13:09,440
and we'll see if we can
get you that shot.

322
00:13:09,484 --> 00:13:12,008
Uh...

323
00:13:13,444 --> 00:13:15,142
Morning, Francesca.

324
00:13:15,185 --> 00:13:17,057
I would say it's
good to see you,

325
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,885
but I really wish
I wasn't back here.

326
00:13:18,928 --> 00:13:20,321
We're gonna figure out why.

327
00:13:20,364 --> 00:13:21,496
Tseng?

328
00:13:21,539 --> 00:13:23,411
Francesca Lyons, 26.

329
00:13:23,454 --> 00:13:25,761
Complains of continued pain
in the lower back.

330
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:27,937
Treated for pain from
mildly herniated discs

331
00:13:27,981 --> 00:13:29,852
with an epidural injection
three weeks ago

332
00:13:29,896 --> 00:13:31,201
and another
six weeks ago.

333
00:13:31,245 --> 00:13:32,855
Do you mind if
I take a look?

334
00:13:34,422 --> 00:13:37,120
Has the pain been consistent
since your last injection?

335
00:13:37,164 --> 00:13:39,166
I felt great during
the first week.

336
00:13:39,209 --> 00:13:41,690
I hiked in Discovery Park,
I biked around the waterfront,

337
00:13:41,733 --> 00:13:43,039
and I got back on Bumble.

338
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:45,172
Sounds very busy.

339
00:13:45,215 --> 00:13:47,174
I started having sex again,
but the pain just came back,

340
00:13:47,217 --> 00:13:49,176
same as the time before.

341
00:13:49,219 --> 00:13:52,962
And now I am on my period, so
I have horrible cramps and this.

342
00:13:53,006 --> 00:13:55,312
Tseng, would you call
for a GYN consult?

343
00:13:55,356 --> 00:13:57,706
Perfect. Lady problems.

344
00:13:57,749 --> 00:14:00,056
That won't be embarrassing to
bring up with my new boyfriend.

345
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,536
Hiker or biker?
Neither.

346
00:14:01,579 --> 00:14:03,320
He's got a boat,
which normally I hate

347
00:14:03,364 --> 00:14:05,366
because sharks
are close to boats.

348
00:14:05,409 --> 00:14:07,716
But I'd be willing to suck it up
because he is so, so hot.

349
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:09,457

It's when the cells that line
the inside of the uterus

406
00:16:22,111 --> 00:16:24,592
grow outside the uterus,
and in some cases,

407
00:16:24,635 --> 00:16:26,942
the tissue can accumulate
in one space.

408
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,813

explain the back pain,

Yeah, casual sex
with friends

705
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:16,580
can be the best kind of
casual sex.

your body, make you feel safe,

all at the same time, so...

708
00:29:24,458 --> 00:29:27,330
Oh, but it's not
casual for you, is it?

709
00:29:27,374 --> 00:29:31,595
Okay. Wilson, if you love him,
you have to tell him,

710
00:29:31,639 --> 00:29:33,162
or you have to stop
having sex with him.

711
00:29:33,206 --> 00:29:34,816
Those are the only
two choices you have

712
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:37,993
to give this friendship
a chance of surviving, okay?

713
00:29:38,037 --> 00:29:39,560
But before you do,

714
00:29:39,603 --> 00:29:42,824

I was so scared

724
