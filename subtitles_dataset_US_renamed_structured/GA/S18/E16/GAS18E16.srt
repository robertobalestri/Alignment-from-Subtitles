Okay, good.

Normal sats.

Colin?

191

Colin, we're gonna do
a quick X-ray

192

You had a vasovagal response.

209

It could be triggered
by a number of things.

Colin started screaming

219
00:07:50,252 --> 00:07:51,862

ripped off his shoulder

220
00:07:51,906 --> 00:07:54,212

221
00:07:54,256 --> 00:07:55,431

isn't on probation?

No.

tie his own shoes?
