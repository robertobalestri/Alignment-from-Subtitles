So, the committee
at the FDA

122
00:04:23,088 --> 00:04:25,090
said the first step
toward getting approval is,

123
00:04:25,134 --> 00:04:27,615
we have to prove that the cells
can survive at every stage.

124
00:04:27,658 --> 00:04:30,095
They need to make it through
the reprogramming process,

125
00:04:30,139 --> 00:04:33,403
differentiation, suspension
prep, and cryopreservation

126
00:04:33,447 --> 00:04:35,057
without turning into
cancerous cells.

127
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,364

the cell maturation process.

Well, you have,

once they've been injected

131
00:04:43,718 --> 00:04:44,893

How do we fix it?

Okay.

Okay. Shoot.
David Hamilton.

I think I fell
for the charm...Mm-hmm.

530
00:22:56,331 --> 00:22:58,464
...and I'm forgetting
that that charm often has

531
00:22:58,507 --> 00:23:01,684
a dark side, and he's having
what amounts to a tantrum.

532
00:23:01,728 --> 00:23:03,425
Yes.
I've seen them before.

533
00:23:03,469 --> 00:23:05,253
Okay, so, is he
a textbook narcissist,

534
00:23:05,296 --> 00:23:06,646
or do I have
some wiggle room?

535
00:23:06,689 --> 00:23:08,430
I-I don't think David's
a bad guy, really.

536
00:23:08,474 --> 00:23:12,434
I just -I think doctors
make the worst patients.

537
00:23:12,478 --> 00:23:13,740
I didn't realize you knew.

I mean, come on.
You're on my turf here,

539
00:23:15,306 --> 00:23:18,048
and Parkinson's, it's a pretty
hard disease to hide.

540
00:23:18,092 --> 00:23:19,702
Look, from what I understand,
David's throwing

541
00:23:19,746 --> 00:23:21,182
every penny he's got
at your project,

542
00:23:21,225 --> 00:23:22,749
but he's not in it
for the greater good.

543
00:23:22,792 --> 00:23:24,620
I mean, if that's what he told
you and you bought it,

544
00:23:24,664 --> 00:23:26,274
then, yeah,
you fell for his charm.

545
00:23:26,317 --> 00:23:29,146
I fell for the charm?
Yes, you might have.

546
00:23:30,365 --> 00:23:32,106
I was thinking of him
like an investor.

547
00:23:32,149 --> 00:23:35,805
A scientist with big ideas
and deep pockets.

548
00:23:35,849 --> 00:23:37,372
I should have been
thinking about him

549
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:40,419
as a class A surgeon with
a neurodegenerative disease...

550
00:23:40,462 --> 00:23:43,030
Mm-hmm.
...who cannot
operate anymore.

551
00:23:43,073 --> 00:23:45,685
So he's not only difficult,
but he's desperate.

552
00:23:45,728 --> 00:23:48,339
Y-Yeah, David's been treated
like a god around here

553
00:23:48,383 --> 00:23:51,473
for a very, very long time,
and now he's becoming obsolete.

554
00:23:51,517 --> 00:23:53,867
So, difficult, desperate,
and terrified.

555
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:55,303
So you can
cut him some slack,

556
00:23:55,346 --> 00:23:56,783

walk over you.

557
