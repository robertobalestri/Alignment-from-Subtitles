1
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:08,340
Whatever this is,

2
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:08,340
I don't want it to end.

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:10,530
Sorry. I didn't know.

4
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:13,230
Natalie, this is Claire,

5
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:13,230
my ex-wife.

6
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:16,210
How long before

7
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:16,210
Auggie gets a liver?

8
00:00:16,310 --> 00:00:17,680
He's low on the list.

9
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:19,440
You're pregnant.

10
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:22,450
How could this happen?

11
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:22,450
You cannot tell my parents.

12
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:24,310
Dr. Sexton!

13
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:25,610
What were you thinking?

14
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:28,380
He had the right to die

15
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:28,380
on his own terms.

16
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:29,690
He could lose his residency.

17
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:32,120
Noah should've thought about

18
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:32,120
that before he acted.

19
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:34,660
You're fired

20
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:34,660
for negligence.

21
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:39,630
May I have a coffee

22
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:39,630
to go, please?

23
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:39,630
Of course.

24
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:42,430
Double coming up.

25
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:44,370
I'm embracing

26
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:44,370
my Italian heritage.

27
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:46,470
Oh, right.

28
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:49,370
Look at him.

29
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:54,380
Still can't believe

30
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:54,380
he fired Noah.

31
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,010
You don't know

32
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,010
the whole story.

33
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,620
Hey. What are you doing?

34
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:14,170
Did you even

35
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:14,170
make it home last night?

36
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:18,200
I'm sorry, what?

37
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:18,200
Kinda busy.

38
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,540
You're your own

39
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,540
worst enemy, Ethan.

40
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:26,670
Morning.

41
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:28,220
Morning.

42
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:31,150
Listen, um,

43
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:31,150
about last night,

44
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:33,720
I shouldn't have shown up

45
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:33,720
unannounced like that.

46
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,260
It's fine.

47
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,520
And I completely understand

48
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,520
if you and your ex are...

49
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:39,190
No. It's nothing like that.

50
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:40,560
'Cause there's a lot

51
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:40,560
of history there, so...

52
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:42,720
Natalie, my ex and I are not

53
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:42,720
getting back together again,

54
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:45,230
if that's what you mean.

55
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:45,230
She just dropped

56
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:45,230
something off.

57
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:46,530
Oh, I just thought maybe...

58
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:48,730
Dr. Manning, Dr. Marcel,

59
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:48,730
got an incoming trauma.

60
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,070
Ambo just unloaded.

61
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:52,730
Okay.

62
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:52,730
Got it. Baghdad.

63
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:52,730
What've we got?

64
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:55,370
Cindy Morales, 32.

65
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:55,370
Contractor.

66
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:57,500
She fell off the scaffolding

67
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:57,500
at a construction site.

68
00:01:57,610 --> 00:01:58,600
Landed on rebar.

69
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:00,410
It didn't go

70
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:00,410
all the way through.

71
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:02,380
We stabilized it at the scene.

72
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,450
Patient's mildly tachy,

73
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,450
but BP is stable.

74
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:06,180
Okay. Hey, Cindy?

75
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:07,850
Stay nice and calm

76
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:07,850
for me, okay?

77
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,120
All right.

78
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,120
Here we go, guys.

79
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:13,200
Nice and gentle, now.

80
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:13,200
One, two, three.

81
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:17,320
Cindy, I'm Dr. Manning.

82
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:19,090
This is Dr. Marcel.

83
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:19,090
Can you hear me?

84
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,190
Yes.

85
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,570
Can you tell me

86
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,570
what happened?

87
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:23,800
Got dizzy. Fell.

88
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,600
"A" and "B" intact.

89
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:27,400
Do you remember

90
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:27,400
when you got dizzy?

91
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:30,880
Today. That's what I get

92
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:30,880
for skipping breakfast.

93
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:35,280
BP 118/74. Heart rate 120.

94
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:35,280
Okay.

95
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:39,650
Sorry. Call for blood,

96
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:39,650
type and cross

97
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:39,650
for six and six.

98
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,550
We're gonna give you

99
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,550
something for the pain.

100
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,550
A hundred of fentanyl.

101
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,220
All right, let's get

102
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,220
her up to CT.

103
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,490
I want to see what

104
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,490
we're dealing with before

105
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,490
we take her into surgery.

106
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,560
Don't worry, Cindy,

107
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,560
we're gonna take

108
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,560
good care of you, okay?

109
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:52,220
WOMAN OVER PHONE:

110
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:52,220
I'm sorry

111
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:52,220
to bother you with this,

112
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:54,200
but I couldn't get ahold

113
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:54,200
of Anna's mother.

114
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,500
No. I am... I'm actually

115
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,500
really glad you called.

116
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:59,600
She's always been pretty much

117
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:59,600
of a straight-A student.

118
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:03,650
I guess just this

119
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:03,650
online learning,

120
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:03,650
it's just been a challenge.

121
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,410
It's hard

122
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,410
to get students to focus,

123
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:07,780
especially, when they miss

124
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:07,780
several Zoom classes.

125
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,220
She's not going to class?

126
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,650
She hasn't been handing in

127
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,650
all her assignments, either.

128
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,380
Really?

129
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:15,580
You know what? I had no idea.

130
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,190
Um, she does her homework

131
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,190
over at a friend's house.

132
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:20,560
She's part of, like,

133
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:20,560
a study pod.

134
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,500
Uh, she's there right now,

135
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,500
or at least I hope she is.

136
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,790
You may wanna start

137
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,790
checking her work.

138
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,870
You know what, it sounds

139
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,870
like I'm gonna have to.

140
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:30,230
Look, this has been

141
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:30,230
a difficult year for everyone.

142
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:32,330
I just thought I should

143
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:32,330
bring it to your attention.

144
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,910
Yeah, and you know what?

145
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,910
I appreciate it.

146
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:37,540
I will, uh, definitely talk

147
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:37,540
to her after school.

148
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:40,710
And thank you again

149
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:40,710
for the call.

150
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:40,710
You're welcome.

151
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,900
Hey. Could I get

152
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,900
a quick word?

153
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,900
Um, sure.

154
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:08,670
Those just, uh... They fell

155
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:08,670
out of Anna's coat pocket.

156
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:12,340
Dan, I am so sorry

157
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:12,340
you had to find out this way.

158
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,850
HIPAA, I get, okay?

159
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:16,710
But couldn't you have

160
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:16,710
found a way just to give me

161
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:16,710
a little heads up?

162
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:19,580
I tried to get Anna

163
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:19,580
to talk to you.

164
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:22,720
I feel like an idiot.

165
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:22,720
I'd no idea she was

166
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:22,720
even sexually active.

167
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,830
Like, not a clue.

168
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:30,230
Look, all that

169
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:30,230
I can tell you is that

170
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:30,230
she's scared and confused.

171
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,770
Shoot.

172
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,360
I'm sorry. I gotta run.

173
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,360
Um, are you okay?

174
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,530
Yeah, yeah.

175
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,530
Okay.

176
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:56,420
Over 200 people

177
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:56,420
from the American

178
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:56,420
Hospital Association

179
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:58,550
have RSVP'd

180
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:58,550
for your presentation.

181
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:00,490
A lotta little Zoom boxes.

182
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,500
Okay. What's the breakdown?

183
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,500
Mainly physicians?

184
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,500
Yes, but also pharmacists,

185
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,500
some hospital administrators.

186
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,870
Glad I included

187
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,870
the slide on cost savings.

188
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:09,900
If this goes well today,

189
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:12,670
hospitals all over the country

190
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:12,670
will want to join this trial.

191
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:14,610
That will increase

192
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:14,610
our visibility

193
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:16,610
to get this drug to market

194
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:16,610
that much faster.

195
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:19,770
Sabeena, this presentation

196
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:19,770
is gonna go great. Promise.

197
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,940
Hey, Will.

198
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,940
East Mercy is jammed.

199
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:24,280
They're diverting patients

200
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:24,280
to us. I'm gonna need you.

201
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,290
Sure, but at 3:00, you know

202
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,290
I got my presentation.

203
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,010
Oh, sorry, you're gonna

204
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,010
have to push that.

205
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:32,390
Ethan, come on,

206
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:32,390
you cleared this yesterday.

207
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:34,730
I know, but I just

208
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:34,730
can't spare you.

209
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:41,500
Don't worry. I'm doing it.

210
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,370
Hey.

211
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,370
April, with me, please.

212
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,910
Lucky you.

213
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,910
Stop.

214
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,940
Mr. and Mrs. Bowman,

215
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:53,610
I'm Dr. Choi,

216
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:53,610
this is Nurse Sexton.

217
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,710
Hi.

218
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,840
I understand you passed out

219
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,840
this morning.

220
00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:00,380
Carol overreacted.

221
00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:00,380
I'm fine.

222
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:02,460
Didn't need

223
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:02,460
to call a damn ambulance.

224
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:05,320
How long was your

225
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:05,320
husband unconscious?

226
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:08,930
I don't know.

227
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:08,930
Um, maybe a minute?

228
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:10,800
He's never passed out before.

229
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:13,800
I got worried,

230
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:13,800
and so I called 911.

231
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:16,000
Any chest pain,

232
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:16,000
shortness of breath?

233
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,730
There's nothing wrong

234
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,730
with my heart.

235
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,330
It's my head.

236
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,330
It's killing me.

237
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,340
Did he hit it

238
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,340
when he passed out?

239
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:23,770
No.

240
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:27,110
BP 147/90.

241
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:27,110
It's slightly elevated.

242
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,110
He's been in pain

243
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,110
for almost a year.

244
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:31,610
A year?

245
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:31,610
Oh, here we go.

246
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,420
I thought it was

247
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,420
my teeth, okay?

248
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,010
And I went to the dentist.

249
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,010
Had a root canal,

250
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,010
got a tooth pulled.

251
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,720
Nothing helped.

252
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:40,090
Just kept getting worse.

253
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,560
Did you see a doctor about it?

254
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,560
Of course I did.

255
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,500
Okay. Can you

256
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,500
follow my finger?

257
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,860
Our family doctor thought

258
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,860
that it might be migraines.

259
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:48,770
Another doctor thought

260
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:48,770
that it could be anxiety.

261
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:51,930
Stupid quack. No!

262
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:51,930
Mmm. Mmm-mmm.

263
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,700
I understand you're

264
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,700
in pain, but I do need

265
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,700
to finish my exam.

266
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:58,640
No, no. No,

267
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:58,640
it hurts too much.

268
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,380
Okay.

269
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,540
Uh, let's get a 12-lead

270
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,540
EKG, CBC, BMP,

271
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:03,810
cardiac labs, and a head CT.

272
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,440
Waste of time and money.

273
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,990
Mr. Bowman,

274
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,990
you lost consciousness.

275
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,990
That's concerning.

276
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:10,560
It could indicate an issue

277
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:10,560
with your heart,

278
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:10,560
or blood flow to the brain.

279
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:13,130
In order for us to help you,

280
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:13,130
we have to run these tests.

281
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:18,800
Eric, please.

282
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:18,800
We have health insurance.

283
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:18,800
We're already here.

284
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:26,140
All right. I'll check back

285
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:26,140
in a bit.

286
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,930
Thank you.

287
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,930
Yeah.

288
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:37,680
I saw a hamburger.

289
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:37,680
He was really mean.

290
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:41,020
That's no good.

291
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:41,020
We'll have to have

292
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:41,020
a talk with him.

293
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,960
Are you a police officer?

294
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,060
No, buddy, I'm a doctor.

295
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,920
Hmm.

296
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,010
He's jaundiced

297
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,010
and has ascites.

298
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:01,440
Is that causing his confusion?

299
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:04,450
No. That's from a buildup

300
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:04,450
of ammonia in his blood.

301
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:06,180
It's affecting his brain.

302
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,570
I'm gonna start him

303
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,570
on lactulose,

304
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,620
which will help bring down

305
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,620
the ammonia levels,

306
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,780
but the problem is,

307
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:13,950
everything I'm seeing

308
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:13,950
points to end-stage

309
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:13,950
liver failure.

310
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,620
He needs a transplant

311
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,620
as soon as possible.

312
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,560
Thank you, Dr. Ziesler.

313
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:33,830
I should stay. I can get

314
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:33,830
a sub to cover my classes.

315
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,940
Mmm-mmm. It's okay.

316
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:38,170
I'm taking

317
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:38,170
the day off from work.

318
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:38,170
I'll be with him.

319
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:40,810
Are you sure?

320
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:40,810
Mmm-hmm.

321
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:43,880
I'll keep you posted.

322
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,590
Okay.

323
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,590
Yeah.

324
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:51,050
Hey, Ben.

325
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:51,050
Hi, Sharon.

326
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,560
Hey.

327
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,560
Hey. How's Auggie?

328
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:58,090
Not any better,

329
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:58,090
and we don't have

330
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:58,090
a donor yet.

331
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,790
I'm sorry, Maggie.

332
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:03,630
Weren't you looking

333
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:03,630
at Heredity & Me to see

334
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:03,630
if he had any relatives?

335
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:04,870
Yeah, but it didn't

336
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:04,870
go anywhere.

337
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:06,770
I even asked

338
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:06,770
the ED staff to get typed.

339
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,640
I'll get the word out

340
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,640
to all departments.

341
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:11,580
Hopefully, we'll find a match.

342
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,840
That'd be great.

343
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,840
Okay.

344
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:24,080
Anna!

345
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,160
Anna!

346
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:32,030
What are you doing here?

347
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:33,830
Just, I need to talk

348
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:33,830
to you about something.

349
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:35,660
Can it wait?

350
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:38,240
I really need to talk

351
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:38,240
to you now. Could you

352
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:38,240
get in the car, please?

353
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,180
What?

354
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,620
I, um...

355
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:55,950
I found these

356
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:55,950
in the front hall.

357
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:57,790
Does she know?

358
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:01,700
Sweetie, what is going on?

359
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:01,700
You're 15 years old.

360
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:05,890
I had sex one time! Okay?

361
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:05,890
And we tried to be careful.

362
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:09,130
I'm gonna ask you a question,

363
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:09,130
and I want you

364
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:09,130
to answer me honestly.

365
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,800
Did somebody pressure you

366
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,800
into having sex?

367
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:16,310
No. Nobody pressured me

368
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:16,310
into doing anything.

369
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:16,310
It was Ryan, my boyfriend.

370
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:17,980
Your boyfriend?

371
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:21,020
I thought that Mom

372
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:21,020
didn't want you to date.

373
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,750
No. She doesn't.

374
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,750
She doesn't let me

375
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,750
do anything!

376
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:26,220
Honey, she's just

377
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:26,220
trying to protect you.

378
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,180
Does she know?

379
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:30,660
God, no. And please

380
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:30,660
don't tell her.

381
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:33,030
Honey, I'm not gonna

382
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:33,030
tell her, you are.

383
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,120
I guess I just wish

384
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,120
you could've felt like

385
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:38,860
you could come and talk

386
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:38,860
to us about this.

387
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:40,830
I was gonna tell you...

388
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:43,700
before your lawyer walked in.

389
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:44,800
Oh, God.

390
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:49,870
This thing with your mom,

391
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:49,870
it's just complicated.

392
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:52,740
Yeah. Yeah. No, I get it.

393
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:55,320
You guys are so busy fighting,

394
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:55,320
you totally forgot I existed.

395
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:57,650
Sweetie? Honey?

396
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,810
That is not true. Anna?

397
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,190
Going to Treatment Four.

398
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:11,160
22-year-old female.

399
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:11,160
Jumped out

400
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:11,160
of a moving vehicle.

401
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:14,960
Positive LOC, GCS 11.

402
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:14,960
Good breath

403
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:14,960
sounds bilaterally.

404
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:16,730
BP 90/60.

405
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,070
Oh, my God.

406
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,070
You know her?

407
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:20,640
That's Kelly Bissett.

408
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:22,170
The kidnap victim?

409
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,370
Yeah. Mrs. Bissett, hi.

410
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,340
I'm April Sexton.

411
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,340
Do you remember me?

412
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:28,250
I helped treat your daughter

413
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:28,250
a few weeks ago.

414
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:30,380
Of course, I remember.

415
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:30,380
Can you tell us what happened?

416
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,880
I don't know. I was driving,

417
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,880
she just opened the car door

418
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,880
and jumped.

419
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,160
On my count.

420
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,160
One, two, three!

421
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,980
Lot of road rash.

422
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:41,150
Let's go.

423
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:42,830
How fast were you driving?

424
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:45,400
Um, maybe 30? I don't know.

425
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,430
Hi, Kelly, my name

426
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,430
is Dr. Halstead.

427
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,430
Can you hear me?

428
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:52,210
Do you know where you are?

429
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:55,740
GCS 12. Slightly better

430
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:55,740
than in the field, but she's

431
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:55,740
protecting her airway.

432
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:59,010
I need a CBC, CMP,

433
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:59,010
coags, tox screen.

434
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:01,810
I also want an ECG and

435
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:01,810
let's get her to CT, stat.

436
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,250
On it.

437
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,250
Let's go.

438
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,980
Let's go.

439
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:10,460
Is she going to be okay?

440
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,450
She's breathing on her own,

441
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,730
and her heart is strong.

442
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,730
That's a good thing.

443
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:16,890
We'll know more

444
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:16,890
when we get her scans back.

445
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,830
Mrs. Bissett,

446
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,830
I have to ask you,

447
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:21,400
when Kelly jumped

448
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:21,400
out of the car,

449
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,470
do you think she was

450
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,470
trying to kill herself?

451
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:28,170
I don't know.

452
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:28,170
I really don't know.

453
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:30,040
Okay.

454
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,180
Give me some suction here

455
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,180
where the rebar is.

456
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,310
Pressure's starting to drop.

457
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:39,150
Okay. Keep giving her

458
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:39,150
blood and plasma.

459
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:41,450
Rebar goes right through

460
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:41,450
the hilum of the spleen.

461
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,820
Got to get it out before

462
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,820
I get control of the vessels

463
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,820
and remove the spleen.

464
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,860
It's gonna bleed

465
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,860
like hell. Okay?

466
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,450
Laps and curved six

467
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,450
ready to go?

468
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,450
Ready.

469
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,020
All right. Here we go.

470
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:57,930
Okay.

471
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,270
Laps!

472
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:08,080
How's her pressure, Marty?

473
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:08,080
Ninety over sixty-six.

474
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,780
Okay, keep giving her product.

475
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:12,480
Hey. How's she doing?

476
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:14,380
Spleen's coming out now.

477
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,320
All right.

478
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,430
Damn.

479
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,100
What is it?

480
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:34,300
Tumor the size

481
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:34,300
of a golf ball.

482
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,900
On the back wall

483
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,900
of the stomach.

484
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,900
It didn't show on the CT.

485
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:40,780
Too much scatter

486
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:40,780
from the rebar to see it.

487
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,240
Can you resect it?

488
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:43,550
Not without

489
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:43,550
the patient's consent.

490
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:47,820
I'm gonna send

491
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:47,820
a sample to pathology.

492
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:54,530
Miss Bissett?

493
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:54,530
Dr. Charles.

494
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:56,490
I just heard about Kelly.

495
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:56,490
Mmm.

496
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:59,490
Um, Dr. Halstead

497
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:59,490
told me that

498
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,490
she broke her pelvis,

499
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,490
and has a concussion.

500
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,490
I'm so sorry.

501
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,940
Yes. They took her

502
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,940
for more tests.

503
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:09,170
So, I understand that she

504
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:09,170
jumped out of your car.

505
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,440
Do you have any idea why?

506
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:11,810
Were you having

507
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:11,810
an argument?

508
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:13,880
Taking her some place

509
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:13,880
she didn't want to go?

510
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:16,510
No, just the opposite.

511
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:16,510
We were going to Navy Pier.

512
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:17,880
Oh.

513
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:19,850
I used to take her there

514
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:19,850
all the time

515
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:19,850
when she was little.

516
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:21,820
Oh.

517
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:21,820
She loved it.

518
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:23,880
So did my youngest.

519
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:26,120
Oh, boy. That Ferris wheel

520
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:26,120
was her favorite.

521
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:29,130
What was Kelly's?

522
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,520
Yeah, I don't remember.

523
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:35,100
She liked it all.

524
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,610
I thought she'd be so happy.

525
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:41,840
I just don't understand

526
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:41,840
what happened.

527
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:44,340
Any incidents or issues

528
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:46,610
before today that are

529
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:46,610
standing out for you?

530
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,110
Not really.

531
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,310
Hmm.

532
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:53,890
Just... I never know

533
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:53,890
what she's thinking.

534
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:56,390
Look, she's been gone

535
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:56,390
for over 12 years,

536
00:14:56,890 --> 00:15:00,020
during which, she went

537
00:14:56,890 --> 00:15:00,020
from being a little girl

538
00:14:56,890 --> 00:15:00,020
to an adult.

539
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:02,190
There's bound to be

540
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:02,190
a period of transition,

541
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,270
and you just gotta

542
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,270
try and be patient.

543
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:07,120
She's my daughter.

544
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,970
Yeah.

545
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:14,070
But to tell you the truth,

546
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:14,070
it's like we're strangers.

547
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:26,620
You have news?

548
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:30,080
One of the donors

549
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:30,080
you had typed

550
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:30,080
is a match to Auggie.

551
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,160
That's wonderful.

552
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:35,090
Yes, but unfortunately,

553
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:35,090
there's a problem.

554
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,430
The donor has amyloidosis.

555
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:39,190
So?

556
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,030
Maggie...

557
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,100
I know it causes protein

558
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,100
to build up in the organs,

559
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,400
but that might not

560
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,400
happen for years.

561
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:47,410
But it will

562
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:47,410
happen eventually,

563
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:50,100
and when it does,

564
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:50,100
it will be life-threatening.

565
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:53,240
Yeah, but who knows

566
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:53,240
what treatments

567
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:53,240
they might have by then.

568
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,480
Sharon,

569
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,910
Auggie needs this liver.

570
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:02,920
I understand.

571
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:02,920
I'll tell you what,

572
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:06,560
if Dr. Ziesler confirms

573
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:06,560
that it's an emergency,

574
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:09,530
I can allow

575
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:09,530
the transplant to proceed.

576
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,490
She will.

577
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,540
We got your test results back.

578
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,540
Your labs and CT

579
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,540
came back normal.

580
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:27,570
I told you so. You know what,

581
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:27,570
you never should've

582
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:27,570
brought me here.

583
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,950
Oh, Mr. Bowman,

584
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:31,680
I did hear a slight murmur

585
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:31,680
when I was listening to

586
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:31,680
your heart earlier,

587
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:33,320
and I'd like to do

588
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:33,320
an echocardiogram.

589
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,180
No. No. No more tests.

590
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:38,660
Can you get this off me,

591
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:38,660
and where are my clothes?

592
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,460
Actually, Mr. Bowman,

593
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,460
an echo is a non-invasive...

594
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:44,260
You know what? I've had

595
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:44,260
that murmur since I was a kid.

596
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:46,100
There is nothing wrong

597
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:46,100
with my heart.

598
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,190
Then an echo will prove that.

599
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:50,530
Every time you people poke me

600
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:50,530
or jab me with a needle,

601
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,230
you make this pain

602
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,230
in my head worse.

603
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:55,980
Why don't you fix that?

604
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:55,980
We will.

605
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:58,680
But you came in today

606
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:58,680
because you

607
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:58,680
lost consciousness.

608
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:00,510
A potentially

609
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:00,510
life-threatening issue.

610
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:03,280
So, please, let us find out

611
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:03,280
what caused it.

612
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:07,680
Fine, but you are just

613
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:07,680
like every other crap doctor

614
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:07,680
that I have been to.

615
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:08,980
Eric, please.

616
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:10,180
You know what? Shut up!

617
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,050
I am sick and tired

618
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,050
of you treating me this way,

619
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,590
talking to me

620
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,590
like I'm a child.

621
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,590
I am trying to...

622
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:15,030
Shut your mouth!

623
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:15,030
I'm not done talking!

624
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:17,220
I'm sorry, Mr. Bowman,

625
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:17,220
could you please not...

626
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:18,770
You can just stay out of it.

627
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:18,770
Let's all calm down.

628
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:20,260
I can't be around you

629
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:20,260
when you're like this.

630
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,390
Then go! Get out! I don't

631
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,390
want you here, anyway!

632
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:31,340
I don't want to be here.

633
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:34,610
Hey, Cindy.

634
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,150
It's Dr. Marcel

635
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,150
and Dr. Manning.

636
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,150
How are you feeling?

637
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:39,280
Tired.

638
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,650
Yeah, I'm sure.

639
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,650
That's understandable.

640
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:45,530
So, I want you to know

641
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:45,530
that the surgery to remove

642
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:45,530
the rebar went well.

643
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:49,460
Now, unfortunately,

644
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:49,460
there was significant damage

645
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:49,460
to the spleen,

646
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,260
so, ultimately,

647
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,260
we had to take it out.

648
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,760
But during the surgery,

649
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,760
we discovered a large mass

650
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,760
in your stomach.

651
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:59,170
A tumor.

652
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:01,470
And I'm afraid to say,

653
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:01,470
it is malignant.

654
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:04,370
I knew it.

655
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:06,500
You did?

656
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:12,150
I've been

657
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:12,150
having pain for a while.

658
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:14,610
Just like my mom.

659
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:19,550
She died from stomach cancer

660
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:19,550
five years ago.

661
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:23,120
I'm so sorry to hear that.

662
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:25,170
Look, I left

663
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:25,170
your abdomen open,

664
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,600
so, with your consent,

665
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,600
I could take you to the OR,

666
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:30,100
and we can remove

667
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:30,100
that cancer right now.

668
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:32,360
No.

669
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:38,480
It's best to remove

670
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:38,480
the tumor before it has

671
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:38,480
a chance to spread.

672
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:43,170
I won't do the surgery.

673
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:43,170
Just please, close me back up.

674
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:47,460
Okay, then, we can have

675
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:47,460
an oncologist come by,

676
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,250
and discuss further

677
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,250
treatment options.

678
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,520
I can't do that. I won't.

679
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,490
May I ask why?

680
00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:00,470
For years, I watched my mom

681
00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:00,470
go through painful surgeries.

682
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,670
Chemo made her so sick,

683
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,670
she couldn't get out of bed.

684
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:10,500
All those

685
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:10,500
horrible treatments,

686
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:10,500
and she died, anyway.

687
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:15,570
Cindy, you have to understand,

688
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:15,570
cancer treatments

689
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:15,570
have come a long way.

690
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:21,350
Cindy, without treatment,

691
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:21,350
the cancer will continue

692
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:21,350
to grow.

693
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:25,120
If you choose to do nothing,

694
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:25,120
this cancer will kill you.

695
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:29,790
Then, at least,

696
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:29,790
I'll die on my own terms.

697
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:43,230
I hate the thought of

698
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:43,230
standing by and doing nothing.

699
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:44,330
Yeah.

700
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:46,740
This rate, she'll most likely

701
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:46,740
be dead in six months.

702
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:50,380
You know,

703
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:50,380
she's effectively

704
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:50,380
killing herself.

705
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,150
Can we argue she's suicidal?

706
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:53,920
Seems like a long shot.

707
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:57,760
Don't close her up yet.

708
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:57,760
Let me talk to Ms. Goodwin.

709
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:12,530
I've actually been thinking

710
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:12,530
about you quite a lot

711
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:12,530
the last few weeks,

712
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:15,400
just wondering what's it been

713
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:15,400
like for you, being home?

714
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:17,670
How has it been going?

715
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:19,410
Okay.

716
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:19,410
Yeah?

717
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:24,180
I mean, getting your

718
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:24,180
freedom back,

719
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:24,180
being able to come and go,

720
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:27,350
make your own decisions,

721
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:27,350
it's gonna take a little

722
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:27,350
getting used to, right?

723
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:30,320
I guess.

724
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:30,320
Yeah.

725
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:33,590
And how about you and

726
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:33,590
your mom? How's things

727
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:33,590
going between the two of you?

728
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:40,720
She told me that

729
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:40,720
she was taking you

730
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:40,720
to Navy Pier,

731
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,860
like she used to

732
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,860
when you were a little kid.

733
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:46,870
Gosh, my kids, they just

734
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:46,870
used to love going there.

735
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:49,380
Especially my youngest.

736
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:49,380
That Ferris wheel?

737
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,840
Did you ever go on it?

738
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:54,810
I don't know.

739
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:54,810
I can't remember.

740
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,350
No? I'm just curious, Kelly,

741
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,450
what do you remember

742
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,450
from that time?

743
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:03,580
None of those things.

744
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:06,890
None of what things?

745
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:09,790
That my mom keeps

746
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:09,790
talking about

747
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:09,790
that we used to do.

748
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:14,560
Baking cinnamon rolls

749
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:14,560
every Saturday morning,

750
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:16,800
reading Harry Potter

751
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:16,800
books together...

752
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:21,670
Well, I can't imagine

753
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:21,670
how upsetting that must be.

754
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:25,650
But try and understand

755
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:25,650
that your captor,

756
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:29,740
he did everything he could

757
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:29,740
to wipe out your identity.

758
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:33,840
And he had years to do it.

759
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:33,840
But I think that with time,

760
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:37,850
and with a little help,

761
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:37,850
and a lot of patience,

762
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,790
that those memories

763
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,790
are gonna start coming back.

764
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,790
I really do.

765
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,490
I don't know. I just...

766
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:48,000
I can't remember any of it.

767
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,480
We're ready to take

768
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,480
Auggie to surgery.

769
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:05,610
Hold on

770
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:05,610
just a second.

771
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:08,980
Madeline, what's going on?

772
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:12,390
DCFS won't

773
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:12,390
allow me to approve

774
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:12,390
Auggie's transplant.

775
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:15,990
But Dr. Ziesler signed off

776
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:15,990
on it. She confirmed that

777
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:15,990
it's an emergency.

778
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:18,000
I heard there's an issue

779
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:18,000
with the transplant.

780
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,590
DCFS is calling it off.

781
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:21,640
The liver is compromised.

782
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,970
Only a family member can

783
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,970
consent to the transplant.

784
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:25,840
But Auggie doesn't

785
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:25,840
have any family.

786
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:28,410
I'm sorry, Maggie.

787
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:28,410
These are DCFS rules.

788
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:29,530
This is insane.

789
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,580
Isn't there

790
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,580
something else we can do?

791
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:33,480
Not at my end.

792
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:44,950
Our drug can give people

793
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:44,950
their lives back.

794
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:46,950
Based on preliminary data,

795
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:50,500
we can project an increase

796
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:50,500
of 2.7 quality-of-life years.

797
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:52,700
A tremendous improvement.

798
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:56,730
This drug

799
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:56,730
could reduce hospital stays

800
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:56,730
by as much as 22%,

801
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:59,400
resulting in

802
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:59,400
significant savings.

803
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:01,480
And our initial calculations

804
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:01,480
estimate that to be

805
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:04,480
well over a hundred

806
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:04,480
million dollars

807
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:04,480
in the first five years.

808
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:07,050
Money that could fund

809
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:07,050
transplant programs

810
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:11,110
and stem cell research

811
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:11,110
to not only advance the

812
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:11,110
treatment of heart failure,

813
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:14,050
but to one day,

814
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:14,050
eradicate it altogether.

815
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:16,950
Thank you for your time.

816
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:21,960
That was spectacular.

817
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:25,390
Very effective.

818
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:25,390
Thanks.

819
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:27,930
Look at that.

820
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:36,940
You know, you should consider

821
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:36,940
doing this as a full-time gig.

822
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,070
Oh, yeah. Really?

823
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:39,540
No, I'm serious.

824
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:42,080
You could have

825
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:42,080
a bright future

826
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:42,080
running clinical trials.

827
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:43,950
Uh, I don't know.

828
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:48,610
I could set up a meeting

829
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:48,610
for you with Mark Barragan,

830
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:48,610
Kender's CEO.

831
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:53,990
I'm flattered, really,

832
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:57,430
but I'm an ED doc.

833
00:23:57,530 --> 00:23:59,730
You know, treating patients,

834
00:23:57,530 --> 00:23:59,730
it's what I love.

835
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:05,540
Speaking of which,

836
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:05,540
I'd better get going.

837
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:09,540
It's too bad you can't stay

838
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:09,540
and wait for the rest of

839
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:09,540
the rave reviews to come in.

840
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,640
Oh, hearing 'em from you

841
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,640
is all I need.

842
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:13,480
I'll see ya.

843
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:25,450
Hey. Mr. Bowman's echo

844
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:25,450
was normal.

845
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:28,660
Yeah. There's

846
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:28,660
nothing wrong with his heart.

847
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,000
So, why did he pass out?

848
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:32,720
I don't know yet.

849
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:36,130
I'm trying to figure out

850
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:36,130
if it's connected

851
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:36,130
to the pain in his head.

852
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,070
Maybe shingles

853
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,070
or a nerve disorder.

854
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:43,180
A little sleep

855
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:43,180
might be a better idea.

856
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:50,550
It's Mr. Bowman.

857
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,980
They're coming.

858
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,980
What happened?

859
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:58,820
He got a horrible jolt of pain

860
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:58,820
in his jaw, and now he can't

861
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:58,820
even open his mouth.

862
00:24:58,930 --> 00:24:59,920
Let me take a look.

863
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,670
See that, I barely

864
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,670
touched him.

865
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,670
Yeah.

866
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:07,790
All right. Mrs. Bowman,

867
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:07,790
do certain things seem

868
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:07,790
to trigger an attack?

869
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:09,530
Eating, drinking,

870
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:09,530
brushing his teeth?

871
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:12,130
All of that. I can't even turn

872
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:12,130
the fan on in our bedroom

873
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,540
without the breeze

874
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,540
hurting his face.

875
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,840
Okay, April, 50 of fentanyl.

876
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,170
I need to get you an MRI

877
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,170
of your head and face.

878
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:19,980
Eric, Eric,

879
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:19,980
listen to me, please.

880
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,550
I think I may know

881
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,550
what's causing this.

882
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:23,080
Something the other doctors

883
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:23,080
never considered.

884
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:24,650
Listen to him, Eric.

885
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:24,650
Eric, please.

886
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:27,050
Eric, let me help you.

887
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:28,550
Listen, listen. Please.

888
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:31,990
April, let them know

889
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:31,990
we're coming up.

890
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:31,990
Yeah.

891
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:43,130
Mrs. Bowman?

892
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:43,130
This is Dr. Abrams.

893
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:47,740
I'm amazed Dr. Choi

894
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:47,740
is actually right.

895
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:51,010
It's a classic case

896
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:51,010
of trigeminal neuralgia.

897
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:52,100
What is that?

898
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:56,270
It's a condition where

899
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:56,270
an artery is pulsating

900
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:56,270
against a nerve.

901
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:58,680
And eventually, the nerve's

902
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:58,680
insulation is worn down

903
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:01,020
to the point where every pulse

904
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:01,020
triggers the nerve to fire.

905
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:04,290
Causes excruciating pain,

906
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:04,290
as I'm sure you've witnessed.

907
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:06,820
So bad, that patients

908
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:06,820
have been known to

909
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:06,820
take their own lives.

910
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,690
And judging from

911
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,690
the scans, the extent

912
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,690
of the nerve damage,

913
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:11,790
I think the pain was

914
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:11,790
what caused your husband

915
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:13,300
to lose consciousness

916
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:13,300
this morning.

917
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:16,790
We've been to so many doctors.

918
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:16,790
Why didn't any of them

919
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:16,790
find this?

920
00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:19,200
Incompetent, maybe?

921
00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:19,200
No.

922
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:24,180
Um, it's often misdiagnosed

923
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:24,180
as a dental issue because

924
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:24,180
of the pain in the jaw.

925
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:25,970
Is there a cure?

926
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,640
It can be managed

927
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,640
with medication,

928
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,640
but I recommend surgery.

929
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:30,310
A microvascular decompression.

930
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:32,140
I cut a small window

931
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:32,140
in his skull

932
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:35,250
and insert a piece of Teflon

933
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:35,250
cushion between the artery

934
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:35,250
and the nerve.

935
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:37,820
That sounds dangerous.

936
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:39,720
Much less so

937
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:39,720
with me doing it.

938
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,190
Okay.

939
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,630
Maggie,

940
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,630
his sats are dropping.

941
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:55,040
I'll up the flow of oxygen.

942
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:56,870
Go to ten liters.

943
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:06,150
Maggie, if he doesn't

944
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:06,150
start to improve,

945
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:06,150
I'm gonna have to intubate.

946
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:20,930
Hey, little man,

947
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:20,930
can you hear me?

948
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:23,060
Mom...

949
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:26,170
Oh, no, sweetie.

950
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:26,170
It's Maggie.

951
00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:34,910
No. Mom.

952
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:54,000
I'm right here.

953
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:07,740
Sharon.

954
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:07,740
Yeah?

955
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:11,890
Auggie's getting worse.

956
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:11,890
They're gonna have

957
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:11,890
to intubate him soon.

958
00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:13,350
Oh, Maggie.

959
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:16,790
I'm so sorry.

960
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:18,360
I just spoke to Ben.

961
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:20,750
We've decided

962
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:20,750
to adopt Auggie.

963
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:23,050
Great!

964
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:23,050
I know.

965
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,720
That's wonderful news.

966
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,720
I know.

967
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,200
He already

968
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,200
sees us as parents.

969
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:32,700
Gastern said that

970
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:32,700
a family member could

971
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:32,700
consent to the transplant.

972
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:36,070
But you won't be

973
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:36,070
granted parental rights

974
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:36,070
overnight, Maggie.

975
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:37,710
I know.

976
00:28:37,810 --> 00:28:41,250
But Auggie is running

977
00:28:37,810 --> 00:28:41,250
out of time, Sharon.

978
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,280
If he doesn't get

979
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,280
the transplant today,

980
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:48,410
because of some stupid rule,

981
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,050
he could die.

982
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:55,360
All right,

983
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:55,360
call the transplant team,

984
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:55,360
get Auggie to the OR.

985
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:57,360
I'll sign off

986
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:57,360
on the surgery.

987
00:28:58,330 --> 00:28:59,730
And what about DCFS?

988
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:03,740
Well, if they wanna

989
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:03,740
raise a stink, fine,

990
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:03,740
I'll go to the press.

991
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,040
Believe me, they don't

992
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,040
want this tried in the court

993
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,040
of public opinion.

994
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,840
Thank you!

995
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:21,850
So, I thought it might be

996
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:21,850
a good idea if the three

997
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:21,850
of us could sit together

998
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:25,150
and come

999
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:25,150
to a better understanding

1000
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:25,150
of what happened this morning.

1001
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:27,860
We were talking

1002
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:27,860
this morning about how

1003
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:31,060
you've been sharing

1004
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:31,060
all these memories

1005
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:31,060
with Kelly.

1006
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:34,330
And she's having

1007
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:34,330
a difficult time

1008
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:34,330
accessing those,

1009
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:37,230
and that's been painful

1010
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:37,230
and confusing for her.

1011
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:40,360
I'm sorry, Mom.

1012
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:40,360
It's all right, honey.

1013
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:44,040
I remember my room,

1014
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:44,040
and I remember my bear,

1015
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:46,980
but all these memories,

1016
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:51,910
all these happy memories

1017
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:51,910
you keep talking about

1018
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:51,910
are just gone.

1019
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:55,490
Right. And in

1020
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:55,490
the car this morning?

1021
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:57,480
What was going on?

1022
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:57,480
What happened?

1023
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:01,920
I couldn't take it anymore.

1024
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:01,920
I wanted to get away.

1025
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:05,120
Almost like the despair

1026
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:05,120
that you had

1027
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:05,120
at not being able

1028
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:07,060
to reclaim

1029
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:07,060
that part of yourself.

1030
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:08,860
It just made you want to flee.

1031
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:11,260
Does that sound right?

1032
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:15,910
Well, you know,

1033
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:15,910
Kelly's memory issues

1034
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:18,980
are actually understandable,

1035
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:18,980
given the ordeal that

1036
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:18,980
she's been through.

1037
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:22,210
But I couldn't help noticing

1038
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:22,210
that you, Ms. Bissett,

1039
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,510
you were also having

1040
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,510
a hard time remembering

1041
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,510
something this morning.

1042
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:29,080
And that was Kelly's

1043
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:29,080
favorite ride at Navy Pier,

1044
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:32,160
which is a place you said

1045
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:32,160
you'd been to a lot together.

1046
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:34,190
Do you think

1047
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:34,190
there's a chance that

1048
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:38,970
you might be embellishing

1049
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:38,970
these memories a bit?

1050
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:40,130
Embellishing the truth?

1051
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:44,330
It's my fault...

1052
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,170
It's my fault she jumped

1053
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,170
out of the car.

1054
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,570
Mom, no.

1055
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,840
We hardly went to Navy Pier.

1056
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:54,040
What?

1057
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:56,910
And the baking,

1058
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:56,910
Harry Potter,

1059
00:30:57,050 --> 00:30:58,580
we got through half

1060
00:30:57,050 --> 00:30:58,580
of book one...

1061
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:03,250
I always wanted to do

1062
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:03,250
all these things with you,

1063
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,450
there just never seemed

1064
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,450
to be enough time.

1065
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,550
Right.

1066
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:08,590
But it was just

1067
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:08,590
the two of us.

1068
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:08,590
I had to work.

1069
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:11,560
And then one day,

1070
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:15,040
you didn't come home

1071
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:15,040
from school.

1072
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:18,510
And I could never

1073
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:18,510
make it up to you.

1074
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:25,570
Getting you back,

1075
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:25,570
it's a miracle.

1076
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:31,440
And I just want to be

1077
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:31,440
the mother you deserve.

1078
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:55,400
Hey. I spoke to Ms. Goodwin.

1079
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:55,400
She nixed my idea.

1080
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:58,340
Said even if we put her

1081
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:58,340
on a psych hold, we couldn't

1082
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:58,340
force her to have surgery.

1083
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:00,350
Right. It was worth a shot.

1084
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:02,940
Yeah. She's 32.

1085
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:04,440
So young.

1086
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,250
Guess you should go

1087
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,250
close her up.

1088
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,290
Let me talk to her

1089
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,290
one more time.

1090
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,290
Okay.

1091
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:12,550
Alone. Please.

1092
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:14,920
Okay.

1093
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:24,640
Are you gonna

1094
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:24,640
close me up soon?

1095
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:26,240
I really wanna

1096
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:26,240
get out of here.

1097
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:30,170
Yeah. I'm sure you had

1098
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:30,170
your fill of hospitals

1099
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:30,170
when your mom was sick.

1100
00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:36,340
I can't even stand

1101
00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:36,340
the smell of flowers.

1102
00:32:37,650 --> 00:32:40,550
People used to send them

1103
00:32:37,650 --> 00:32:40,550
to her hospital room.

1104
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:44,920
Then to the house,

1105
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:44,920
after she died.

1106
00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:51,390
You know,

1107
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:56,670
I lost my daughter

1108
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:56,670
to leukemia

1109
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:56,670
about ten years ago.

1110
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:01,700
Just a few months

1111
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:01,700
after her first birthday.

1112
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:07,510
I'm so sorry.

1113
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:07,510
It must've been horrible.

1114
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:10,210
She used to fall asleep

1115
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:10,210
on my chest.

1116
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:14,390
Greatest feeling

1117
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:14,390
in the world.

1118
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:19,260
Man, I remember looking down

1119
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:19,260
at her little face,

1120
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:22,560
imagining all the things

1121
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:22,560
I was gonna do with her,

1122
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:25,530
take her to see Santa,

1123
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:25,530
teach her to ride a bike,

1124
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,390
walk her down the aisle.

1125
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:36,630
She was so small,

1126
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:36,630
but so tough, you know?

1127
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,450
Put up one hell of a fight.

1128
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,650
Taught me more about

1129
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,650
courage and resilience

1130
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:47,690
than I could learn

1131
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:47,690
in a lifetime.

1132
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:53,260
I don't talk about this

1133
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:53,260
with many people.

1134
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:56,630
Why did you?

1135
00:33:57,460 --> 00:34:02,400
Because your life

1136
00:33:57,460 --> 00:34:02,400
is just as precious

1137
00:33:57,460 --> 00:34:02,400
as my little girl's.

1138
00:34:07,810 --> 00:34:10,140
And you need

1139
00:34:07,810 --> 00:34:10,140
to fight for it.

1140
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:17,220
Fight for it.

1141
00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:22,690
Okay.

1142
00:34:28,430 --> 00:34:29,420
Hey.

1143
00:34:30,330 --> 00:34:32,490
Hi. She, uh,

1144
00:34:30,330 --> 00:34:32,490
agreed to the surgery.

1145
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:33,590
That's wonderful.

1146
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:36,500
Yeah. I'm gonna go

1147
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:36,500
book her an OR now.

1148
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,300
How'd you get her

1149
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,300
to change her mind?

1150
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:42,030
Made it personal.

1151
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:53,510
Anna?

1152
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:57,680
I got pizza, honey.

1153
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:59,380
Hawaiian pizza.

1154
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:04,450
Which, interestingly enough,

1155
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:04,450
it turns out was invented

1156
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:04,450
in Canada.

1157
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,620
I'm bleeding.

1158
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:13,600
Okay. Uh... Let's, uh,

1159
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:13,600
get your coat on.

1160
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:14,800
Okay.

1161
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:21,480
And get you to the hospital.

1162
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:23,810
Okay.

1163
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:23,810
So, we can figure out

1164
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:23,810
what's going on.

1165
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:32,780
I thought

1166
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:32,780
I made myself clear.

1167
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:37,690
I'm sorry, but I didn't

1168
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:37,690
have a choice. And that

1169
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:37,690
presentation was important.

1170
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,700
More important than the ED?

1171
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:42,630
I was only gone an hour,

1172
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:42,630
and I cleared all my patients.

1173
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:44,140
That's not the point, man.

1174
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:46,540
Look, how am I supposed

1175
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:46,540
to run this department

1176
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,200
if I can't trust my doctors?

1177
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:50,440
Look, this trial

1178
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:50,440
is sanctioned

1179
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:50,440
by the hospital.

1180
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:52,550
If you have a problem with it,

1181
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:52,550
take it up with Goodwin.

1182
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:09,660
A chemical pregnancy?

1183
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,860
It's when the fertilized egg

1184
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,860
has chromosomal abnormalities

1185
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:16,140
and doesn't fully implant

1186
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:16,140
into the uterine wall.

1187
00:36:16,370 --> 00:36:19,360
It's like having

1188
00:36:16,370 --> 00:36:19,360
a really bad period.

1189
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:22,170
You wouldn't have known

1190
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:22,170
you were pregnant

1191
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:22,170
had you not taken that test.

1192
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:26,340
Anna,

1193
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:26,340
you're gonna be fine.

1194
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:29,150
I'll give you two

1195
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:29,150
some time.

1196
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:30,780
Thanks, Nat.

1197
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:32,480
Of course.

1198
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:41,390
You know, honey,

1199
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:41,390
I've been thinking a lot

1200
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:41,390
about what you said.

1201
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:43,700
And you're right.

1202
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:43,700
You know, Mom and I,

1203
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:47,530
we've been having

1204
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:47,530
a tough time, and we've been

1205
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:47,530
arguing about a lot of stuff.

1206
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:51,530
But one thing that

1207
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:51,530
we absolutely agree on,

1208
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:53,570
is how much we love you.

1209
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,800
I'm really glad you're here.

1210
00:36:58,910 --> 00:37:00,210
Oh, honey.

1211
00:37:03,350 --> 00:37:04,580
Me, too, sweetie.

1212
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:08,880
So, since I'm not

1213
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:08,880
pregnant anymore,

1214
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:11,690
Mom doesn't have

1215
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:11,690
to know, right?

1216
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,730
We can deal with

1217
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,730
all that stuff later.

1218
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:21,270
Mr. Bowman,

1219
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:21,270
it's Dr. Choi.

1220
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,800
We're all here.

1221
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:27,230
Thirsty.

1222
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:30,610
Here, would you like

1223
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:30,610
an ice chip?

1224
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:30,610
Hmm.

1225
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,610
You're in recovery.

1226
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,610
Mmm.

1227
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:43,520
The operation went well.

1228
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:43,520
How are you feeling?

1229
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:51,530
Oh, my God.

1230
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:02,400
It doesn't hurt anymore.

1231
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:10,680
The pain, I don't believe it.

1232
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,650
Oh, honey.

1233
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:13,910
The pain is gone.

1234
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:16,650
Oh! Really, honey?

1235
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:16,650
Yeah.

1236
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,330
Oh, Carol.

1237
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:26,960
Carol. All those

1238
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:26,960
horrible things I said...

1239
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:28,690
They were terrible. I was...

1240
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,330
We don't have to talk

1241
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,330
about that right now.

1242
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,530
No. I am so sorry.

1243
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,530
So sorry.

1244
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:32,900
It's okay. It's okay.

1245
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:34,410
I'm so sorry.

1246
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:36,500
Oh, sweetie, it's okay.

1247
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:43,810
Mr. Bowman

1248
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:43,810
got his life back

1249
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:43,810
because of you.

1250
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:46,550
Oh, it was

1251
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:46,550
a tough diagnosis.

1252
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:46,550
I got lucky.

1253
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:50,350
Mmm. That wasn't luck.

1254
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:50,350
You went the extra mile

1255
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:50,350
for him.

1256
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:53,480
He was so horrible,

1257
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:53,480
another doctor

1258
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:53,480
might have given up.

1259
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:54,860
But you didn't.

1260
00:38:57,930 --> 00:39:00,370
Just trying to do my job.

1261
00:39:02,370 --> 00:39:03,390
Hey,

1262
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,740
about Noah?

1263
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:08,800
What you did...

1264
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:14,940
I get it. It's not easy

1265
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:14,940
being in charge.

1266
00:39:26,790 --> 00:39:27,780
I'm hungry.

1267
00:39:29,930 --> 00:39:31,690
Now, we know

1268
00:39:29,930 --> 00:39:31,690
you're feeling better.

1269
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,330
Can I have pizza?

1270
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,330
Mmm-mmm.

1271
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:36,630
We'll start

1272
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:36,630
with something lighter

1273
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:37,760
and see

1274
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:37,760
if you can hold it down.

1275
00:39:52,650 --> 00:39:53,640
Sabeena,

1276
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:56,980
I've been

1277
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:56,980
giving some thought

1278
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:56,980
to your offer

1279
00:39:57,090 --> 00:39:59,490
about meeting with

1280
00:39:57,090 --> 00:39:59,490
your guy at Kender.

1281
00:39:57,090 --> 00:39:59,490
I'd like to take you up on it.

1282
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:01,450
Sure.

1283
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,790
But I thought you said

1284
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,790
your heart belonged

1285
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,790
to the ED?

1286
00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:05,690
I don't know.

1287
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,860
I'm just trying to keep

1288
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,860
my options open, I guess.

1289
00:40:08,470 --> 00:40:09,490
Brilliant.

1290
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,700
I'll get something

1291
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,700
on the books

1292
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,700
as soon as possible.

1293
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:12,930
Thanks.

1294
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:15,060
You leaving?

1295
00:40:15,410 --> 00:40:16,400
Yeah.

1296
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:19,840
I'll walk you to your car.

1297
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:19,840
Great.

1298
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,820
Oh, baby.

1299
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:13,630
No.
