1
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:07,100
I came in with

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:07,100
this patient and I'd like

3
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:07,100
to see it through.

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,970
I got a team, thanks.

5
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:10,360
Hey, April.

6
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:12,570
You saved his life.

7
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:12,570
Pretty good for a nurse.

8
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:14,040
Should've gone

9
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:14,040
to med school.

10
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,600
We have to stick

11
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,600
with the playbook.

12
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:17,110
Or we try

13
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:17,110
something else.

14
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:18,510
You have something

15
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:18,510
better in mind.

16
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:20,740
How do we sit here

17
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:20,740
and not even try?

18
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:20,740
I'm with you.

19
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,280
Charge. Clear.

20
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,280
Let's give it a minute.

21
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:26,050
Going behind my back,

22
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:26,050
throwing up Hail Marys.

23
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:27,420
But you and I

24
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:27,420
have a problem.

25
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:30,120
Dr. Marcel,

26
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:30,120
I've got this new device.

27
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,320
Promoting your

28
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,320
products for unapproved uses?

29
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:34,490
It could've worked.

30
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,620
This is far beyond

31
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,620
the bounds of

32
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,620
professional conduct.

33
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:39,590
I started seeing

34
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:39,590
someone new.

35
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,190
Dr. Marcel.

36
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:43,240
You haven't introduced him

37
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:43,240
to Owen yet, have you?

38
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:45,270
Where is all this

39
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:45,270
coming from?

40
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,200
It was pitch black.

41
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:50,340
I couldn't see my hand

42
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:50,340
in front of my face.

43
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:53,540
So, here I am,

44
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:53,540
moving slowly, cautious,

45
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,110
skimming my flashlight

46
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,110
across the water,

47
00:00:58,220 --> 00:00:59,310
when there he is.

48
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:02,520
You do remember that

49
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:02,520
I have a heart condition?

50
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:04,290
Oh, in that moment,

51
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:04,290
I did too.

52
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:07,730
He was big,

53
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:07,730
terrifying big.

54
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:09,660
Right? But I was

55
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:09,660
gonna get him.

56
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:11,790
Oh, dear me,

57
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:11,790
you went in closer?

58
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:14,070
Oh, I had to.

59
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:14,070
All or nothing.

60
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,630
So, I eased in,

61
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,630
lined him up,

62
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:21,400
then, pop! Got him.

63
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:21,400
Ah.

64
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:23,410
Look at this.

65
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,770
Oh, wow!

66
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,770
Look at that.

67
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,550
That's amazing.

68
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,550
No, it's like,

69
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,550
he's right there.

70
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:31,480
Right?

71
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:31,480
Yeah. Wow!

72
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:32,580
Hey.

73
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:33,820
Owen tucked in?

74
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:33,820
Yes.

75
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,460
Fell asleep before

76
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,460
the door got closed.

77
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:37,820
What'd I miss?

78
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:42,090
I asked Crockett

79
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:42,090
about his hobbies

80
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:42,090
and he said photography.

81
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,760
Yes. We were about,

82
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,760
what, five minutes

83
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,760
into our first dinner,

84
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:47,630
before you pulled

85
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:47,630
that story out,

86
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:47,630
and showed me the picture?

87
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:51,530
Yeah, I think it was

88
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:51,530
his move to try

89
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:51,530
and impress me. Mmm-hmm.

90
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,630
Busted.

91
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:56,140
But here we are,

92
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:56,140
many dinners later.

93
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,750
Mmm.

94
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,750
Mission accomplished.

95
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,410
So,

96
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,410
Crockett...

97
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,410
Mmm-hmm.

98
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,350
...I know that you

99
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,350
are a surgeon

100
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:06,580
and have an eye

101
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:06,580
for reptiles.

102
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:09,480
What else?

103
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:09,480
Any siblings?

104
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:11,860
Yeah, a younger sister.

105
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:11,860
Lives in Baton Rouge.

106
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:11,860
Mmm-hmm.

107
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,560
And your parents?

108
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:16,530
Natalie tells me

109
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:16,530
that they emigrated

110
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:16,530
from Iran.

111
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:18,860
So, does that mean

112
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:18,860
that your family is Muslim?

113
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,470
No. We're actually

114
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,470
Zoroastrian.

115
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:26,570
Zoroastrian?

116
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:26,570
I'm sorry... I...

117
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,370
Yeah, it dates back

118
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,370
to ancient Persia.

119
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:31,750
Three main pillars,

120
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:31,750
"good thoughts, good words,

121
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:31,750
good deeds."

122
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:33,110
Mmm.

123
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,440
Not always so easy.

124
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:36,540
Mmm.

125
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:40,880
That's very interesting.

126
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:40,880
Yeah.

127
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,850
I had no idea.

128
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,220
Does anyone want

129
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,220
some coffee?

130
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:45,490
Yeah, I'll take some.

131
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:45,490
Great.

132
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:46,580
Mom, tea?

133
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,320
Yes, sweetheart,

134
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,320
thank you.

135
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:49,760
Okay. I'll be

136
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:49,760
right back.

137
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:49,760
Sure.

138
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,860
Very nice.

139
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,860
Is that a new suit?

140
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:00,400
You wanna tell me

141
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:00,400
what's going on?

142
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:02,170
Just got the new

143
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:02,170
pharma rep rules.

144
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,870
Re-sterilization of

145
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,870
proprietary equipment?

146
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:06,210
In-house device review?

147
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:06,210
Lots of red tape.

148
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:10,510
It's just some adjustments,

149
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:10,510
so all the reps

150
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:10,510
are on the same page.

151
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:12,780
We need to make sure

152
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:12,780
no one's overstepping.

153
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:14,720
This is about Dr. Marcel

154
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:14,720
and me last week, isn't it?

155
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:17,150
Indirectly, Michael, yes.

156
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:19,820
Ma, I am not the only

157
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:19,820
red hat who has pitched

158
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:19,820
a device off-label.

159
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,190
I'm aware of that.

160
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,360
Then why's this

161
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,360
feel personal?

162
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:23,930
This wasn't intentional.

163
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:26,220
The updates are solely

164
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:26,220
to protect the hospital.

165
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:29,190
Sounds like

166
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:29,190
the company line.

167
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,360
Michael. Michael.

168
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,570
Uh-oh.

169
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,570
Michael and I...

170
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,940
It's been rocky

171
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,940
the last few weeks.

172
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,810
Parenthood,

173
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,810
a life sentence, right?

174
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:42,440
Oh, you telling me?

175
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:43,540
Wanna grab a coffee?

176
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:46,880
I don't have time.

177
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:46,880
Maybe later?

178
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:46,880
Yeah.

179
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:48,820
Five courses?

180
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,920
Yeah. Website says they'll

181
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,920
send all the ingredients.

182
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:52,720
We just prepare it.

183
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:53,960
Okay, I'm in.

184
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,530
This weekend?

185
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:58,860
I know, I know.

186
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:58,860
I'm late by 33 seconds.

187
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:00,960
I was just gonna say

188
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:00,960
good morning.

189
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:02,290
But I guess you are late.

190
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,610
Meet up for lunch?

191
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,610
Sounds good.

192
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,680
Still waiting to hear back

193
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,680
on that invitation

194
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,680
to play Chess.

195
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,480
Beginning to think

196
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,480
that you're dodging me.

197
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:15,810
No. Long days.

198
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:15,810
Time my shift ends,

199
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,820
I don't have the brain power.

200
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,320
Maybe play Will.

201
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,320
Tried.

202
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:22,820
It didn't go well.

203
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:22,820
He's a Checkers guy.

204
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:26,290
Anyway, offer's out there.

205
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:30,500
Dr. Choi, incoming.

206
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:30,500
Treatment Three.

207
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,390
Courtney?

208
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,240
Montez Price, 21.

209
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,240
Pro tennis player.

210
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:38,810
Hitting partner

211
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:38,810
accidentally drilled him

212
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:40,500
in the chest

213
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:40,500
with a tennis ball.

214
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:42,670
Trainer said

215
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:42,670
he was unresponsive

216
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:42,670
and pulseless.

217
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,970
Grabbed an AED

218
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,970
and shocked him once.

219
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,680
When we got there,

220
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,680
he was awake

221
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,680
and in sinus rhythm.

222
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:49,580
Tested negative

223
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:49,580
for COVID in the ambo.

224
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:52,280
Get ready

225
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:52,280
to transfer, huh?

226
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,320
Everybody, ready?

227
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,320
One, two, three.

228
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:02,990
Vitals stable. BP 120/82,

229
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:02,990
heart rate 78.

230
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,330
Heart is good,

231
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,330
regular rate and rhythm.

232
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:08,530
Let's get a CBC, BMP,

233
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:08,530
cardiac labs, a 12-lead EKG

234
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:08,530
and a chest X-ray.

235
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:11,530
Hey, Montez?

236
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:11,530
I'm Dr. Choi.

237
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:11,530
Can you hear me?

238
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:13,700
Chest hurts. Did I have

239
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:13,700
a heart attack?

240
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:16,280
No. Your rhythm on monitor

241
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:16,280
looks good.

242
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:18,750
It was likely

243
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:18,750
an episode of what's

244
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:18,750
called commotio cordis.

245
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,350
The blow from the ball

246
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,350
disrupted your

247
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,350
heart rhythm,

248
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,780
caused it to stop beating.

249
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,480
But it's all better now?

250
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,480
Yeah.

251
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:26,490
The impact caused it.

252
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:26,490
It's not your heart.

253
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:29,580
But it still feels funny.

254
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,660
"Funny"? Funny how?

255
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,350
Hey, Montez? Montez?

256
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:36,330
BP's dropping, 72/40.

257
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:36,330
Heart rate's spiking, 180.

258
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:40,060
He's in narrow complex v-tach.

259
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:40,060
Connect the pads

260
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:40,060
to cardiovert.

261
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,970
It's synced.

262
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,970
Clear. Hit it.

263
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:49,610
BP's back up, 120/70,

264
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:49,610
but heart rate's

265
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:49,610
still high, 110.

266
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,510
Bolus 150 milligrams

267
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,510
of amio and hang a drip.

268
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:55,880
Before, his heart

269
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:55,880
wasn't beating at all.

270
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:55,880
Now, it's beating too fast.

271
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:56,970
What's going on?

272
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:11,960
Maybe you should

273
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:11,960
check her chart first,

274
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:14,830
before you waste my time

275
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:14,830
with this dumb question.

276
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:19,430
Morning, Dr. Lanik.

277
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:21,770
Maggie said you requested me

278
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:21,770
for the COVID ICU.

279
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:24,070
Yeah. One less person

280
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:24,070
for me to micromanage.

281
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:26,550
Almost sounds like

282
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:26,550
a compliment.

283
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:29,710
Anyway, thanks.

284
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:29,710
I've really missed...

285
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:29,710
Yeah, sure.

286
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:32,120
You good to go?

287
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:32,120
Always.

288
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:33,480
Counting on you.

289
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:33,480
Go suit up.

290
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:37,760
Dr. Halstead, you're

291
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:37,760
going to Baghdad.

292
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:37,760
Yeah.

293
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:40,760
Liam McIntyre,

294
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:40,760
65-year-old male.

295
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:40,760
COVID negative,

296
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:44,590
GCS 15, BP 100/70,

297
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:44,590
rate 120.

298
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,500
Suspected left shoulder

299
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,500
dislocation.

300
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,500
Okay. Mr. McIntyre?

301
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,500
I'm Dr. Halstead.

302
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,800
You know where you are?

303
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,800
Hospital.

304
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,770
All right. Let's get

305
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,770
ready to transfer.

306
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:56,540
On my count.

307
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:56,540
One, two, three.

308
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:58,910
Thank you.

309
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:03,950
Diminished breath sounds

310
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:03,950
left side.

311
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:05,520
Kathleen, we're

312
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:05,520
gonna need an X-ray.

313
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:08,590
Any pain

314
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:08,590
where I touch?

315
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:08,590
No.

316
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:11,880
Okay. Chin up.

317
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:11,880
Down, left, right.

318
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:12,980
Any pain?

319
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:15,390
Good. C-spine's clear.

320
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:23,410
Mr. McIntyre?

321
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:26,440
Liam? You with me?

322
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,740
I'm fine.

323
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,740
Just a little rattled.

324
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,910
X-ray's up.

325
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,910
Everybody get back.

326
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:35,610
Yep. Small amount

327
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:35,610
of fluid left chest.

328
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,880
Left shoulder dislocated.

329
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,510
Fifty of fentanyl,

330
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,510
two of Versed.

331
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:40,020
Maggie.

332
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:40,020
Yep.

333
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,890
Counter-traction.

334
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,890
All right, Mr. McIntyre.

335
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,050
I'm gonna put this

336
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,050
around your arm.

337
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,150
Okay.

338
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:46,650
This is gonna hurt.

339
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,700
I'm gonna need you

340
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,700
to breathe, okay?

341
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,700
Okay.

342
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:54,060
All right.

343
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,530
Yep, all done.

344
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,530
Shoulder's in.

345
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:58,210
So sorry.

346
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:58,210
You're good, Liam.

347
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:01,170
Now, you just rest

348
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:01,170
for now. Okay?

349
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:01,170
Thanks.

350
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,040
Draw up trauma labs.

351
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:06,710
Yeah.

352
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:10,610
But did you catch how

353
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:10,610
he keeps on looking

354
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:10,610
into the corner of the room?

355
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:13,580
Yeah, it's weird.

356
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:13,580
No evidence of

357
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:13,580
head trauma, though.

358
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:15,750
He's doing it again.

359
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:19,650
Remember our trip to Tahoe?

360
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:19,650
I was in a cast for weeks.

361
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:22,020
But there's

362
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:22,020
no one else there.

363
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:22,020
Yeah, do me a favor.

364
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:23,620
Yeah,

365
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:23,620
contact Dr. Charles.

366
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:24,930
Done.

367
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,860
Thanks.

368
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:30,230
Hey.

369
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:33,670
I wanted to apologize

370
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:33,670
about last night. My mom...

371
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:35,810
No. No apology necessary.

372
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:37,140
Look, I grew up

373
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:37,140
in the Bible Belt.

374
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,800
You were either

375
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,800
Catholic, Methodist,

376
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:39,900
or Southern Baptist.

377
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,920
Not different, you know?

378
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,920
I'm... So, I'm used to it.

379
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,190
Nat, Crockett,

380
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,190
patient in Treatment Four,

381
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:46,480
her name is Lisa Holtzman.

382
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:46,480
Okay.

383
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:47,580
Thanks, Mags.

384
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:47,580
All right.

385
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,930
Hi, Lisa, I'm Dr. Manning.

386
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,930
This is Dr. Marcel.

387
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:53,760
Hey.

388
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:53,760
Belly radiating.

389
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:56,490
"Radiating"? Not a lay term.

390
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:56,490
You a doctor?

391
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,120
No, professional patient.

392
00:08:58,700 --> 00:08:59,960
You mind

393
00:08:58,700 --> 00:08:59,960
if I lift your gown?

394
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:01,230
No.

395
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:01,230
Okay.

396
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,570
Scars on your abdomen,

397
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,570
laparoscopic ports?

398
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,240
Appendix, gallbladder,

399
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,240
all gone.

400
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:07,530
I'm gonna...

401
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,910
Fullness in

402
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,910
the pelvis.

403
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:14,280
We're gonna do

404
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:14,280
an ultrasound, okay?

405
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:14,280
Okay.

406
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,220
Can't see anything.

407
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,250
Bladder's huge

408
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,250
and in the way.

409
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,020
Lisa, when's the last time

410
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,020
you urinated?

411
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,680
I don't know.

412
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,680
Yesterday, I think.

413
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:27,790
Pain could be coming from

414
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:27,790
urinary retention. Foley.

415
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:29,860
We're gonna

416
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:29,860
drain your bladder.

417
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,690
Okay.

418
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,690
It should help ease

419
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,690
the pain, okay?

420
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,830
We'll get you some

421
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,830
meds too, all right?

422
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:36,100
My bag.

423
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:36,100
Grab what's inside.

424
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:46,880
What is all this?

425
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:46,880
My medical records.

426
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:54,050
Hey, Montez,

427
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:54,050
how you feeling?

428
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:58,720
Exhausted. And then

429
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:58,720
there's all this.

430
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,900
Your heart's

431
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,900
still beating irregularly.

432
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:03,190
Too fast. I'm trying

433
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:03,190
to get a read on why.

434
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,260
Your vitals are fine.

435
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:07,230
EKG and echo

436
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:07,230
were both normal.

437
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:09,700
So, you're saying

438
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:09,700
I'm healthy?

439
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:13,100
No, the chart is,

440
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:13,100
but it's wrong.

441
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:15,180
The heart of

442
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:15,180
a 21-year-old pro athlete

443
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,040
should not spontaneously

444
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,040
go into a-fib.

445
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:22,120
This can't be it.

446
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:22,120
I'm too close.

447
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:25,180
My father loved tennis.

448
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:29,280
I was, maybe four,

449
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:29,280
he'd toss me balls,

450
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:29,280
pretend it was the US Open.

451
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:33,230
He'd say, "One day, Montez.

452
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:33,230
Arthur Ash Stadium."

453
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:37,030
He died when

454
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:37,030
I was seven.

455
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:41,860
Been training

456
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:41,860
for the Open ever since,

457
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:41,860
and now, I'm inches away.

458
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:47,040
I need to play

459
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:47,040
in that tournament.

460
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:50,940
I'll keep looking,

461
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:50,940
figure this out.

462
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,380
Seriously? Damn it!

463
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,910
Put pressure,

464
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,910
lean your head forward.

465
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:58,740
Ice pack.

466
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:02,680
I got it. I got it.

467
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:02,680
Happens when I'm stressed.

468
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:02,680
It'll stop.

469
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:09,990
What the hell, Sharon?

470
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:11,190
Ms. Goodwin, I'm so sorry.

471
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:14,360
That's all right, Cheryl,

472
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:14,360
I always have time

473
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:14,360
for our COO.

474
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:17,200
My phone has been

475
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:17,200
ringing off the hook

476
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:17,200
this morning.

477
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:20,940
Angry reps.

478
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:20,940
Your unilateral changes

479
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:20,940
to our red hat protocols,

480
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,030
they're trouble.

481
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,140
I have to do what's best

482
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,140
for the hospital, Gwen,

483
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:27,150
which means reducing

484
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:27,150
liabilities wherever they are.

485
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,410
Our relationship

486
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,410
with pharma and biotech,

487
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,410
they help keep the lights on.

488
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:34,360
If Med is suddenly

489
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:34,360
difficult to work with,

490
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:34,360
they move to East Mercy,

491
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,650
we lose funding.

492
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,250
This is our house.

493
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,250
They can play by our rules.

494
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:42,190
Not these.

495
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:42,190
I'm shutting them down.

496
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,310
Three.

497
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,310
Good.

498
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,440
Mind me asking

499
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,440
where you were

500
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,440
headed this morning

501
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,040
when you had

502
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,040
your accident?

503
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:01,140
Nowhere, really.

504
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,310
Four.

505
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,310
Right.

506
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:06,250
Just out running errands?

507
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:10,290
Just driving. Was cooped up

508
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:10,290
for over a year.

509
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:12,160
But now,

510
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:12,160
that I'm finally vaccinated,

511
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:14,290
I'll take any excuse

512
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:14,290
I can to leave the house.

513
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,800
I hear that.

514
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,260
Who ever thought

515
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,260
we'd actually be

516
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:20,430
looking forward

517
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:20,430
to picking up

518
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:20,430
our dry cleaning, right?

519
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,760
No fingers yet?

520
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,900
Now, I see it. Two.

521
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:26,170
Okay. Okay, good.

522
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:31,900
So, Liam, tell me, uh,

523
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:31,900
what's in the corner?

524
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:34,940
What? No one.

525
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,780
Wait, is it a person?

526
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:43,150
It's my wife. Terri.

527
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:43,150
Oh.

528
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:45,890
Okay.

529
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:50,290
She died

530
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:50,290
three weeks into lockdown.

531
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:50,290
Aneurysm.

532
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,760
I'm very sorry

533
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,760
to hear that.

534
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:56,330
We were actually

535
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:56,330
looking forward

536
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:56,330
to being quarantined.

537
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,430
Cook all those recipes

538
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,430
we never had time for.

539
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:02,470
And then,

540
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:02,470
she was just gone.

541
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,340
Look,

542
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:11,320
I know she's dead,

543
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:11,320
but I swear,

544
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:14,050
she's right there.

545
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:16,780
You know what?

546
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:16,780
I believe you.

547
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:21,890
Tell me, how long roughly

548
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:21,890
have you been seeing her?

549
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,030
A few months.

550
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:31,530
I know my mind

551
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:31,530
is playing tricks on me,

552
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:31,530
but I don't care.

553
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:35,310
Losing Terri

554
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:35,310
was devastating.

555
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:39,140
So, having her back,

556
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:39,140
even like this,

557
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,910
it's salvation.

558
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,350
You know,

559
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:52,050
I actually lost my wife

560
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:52,050
not that long ago.

561
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:52,050
So, trust me, I get it.

562
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:57,200
Look, I'm going to

563
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:57,200
have a quick chat

564
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:57,200
with Dr. Halstead.

565
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:00,130
And then, I'll be back.

566
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:00,130
All right?

567
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:01,260
Okay.

568
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:08,870
So, what do you think?

569
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:08,870
Dementia?

570
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:11,840
No. He's... You know,

571
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:11,840
he's lucid, he's oriented.

572
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:15,410
His peripheral vision

573
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:15,410
is virtually nonexistent

574
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,310
on the right side

575
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,310
in both eyes, all right?

576
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:20,120
And that blind spot

577
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:20,120
is exactly where

578
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:20,120
he's seeing his dead wife.

579
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:22,150
So, she's a visual

580
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:22,150
hallucination.

581
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:24,420
Right. I think

582
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:24,420
we're looking at

583
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:24,420
Charles Bonnet syndrome.

584
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:28,990
Right? Where the brain

585
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:28,990
responds to visual loss

586
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:28,990
by filling in the blanks.

587
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:31,900
But here's the thing,

588
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:31,900
I'm not seeing

589
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:31,900
any evidence of

590
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:34,830
standard signs of

591
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:34,830
vision loss, which makes

592
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:34,830
me think that we're...

593
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:37,430
I don't know, we might be

594
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:37,430
looking at some deeper

595
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:37,430
brain or eye issue.

596
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,400
I'll order an MRI.

597
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,340
Thank you.

598
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,340
Yep.

599
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,340
Lisa, hi.

600
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,340
So, we got your initial

601
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,340
lab results back.

602
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:48,080
And it was normal,

603
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,240
all across the board.

604
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:50,410
Ugh.

605
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:53,980
Sorry, normal's

606
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:53,980
usually good news.

607
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:57,590
I let myself

608
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:57,590
get my hopes up,

609
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:57,590
shouldn't have done that.

610
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:02,490
Volume seven

611
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:02,490
of my 16-year war

612
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:02,490
with abdominal pain.

613
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:06,900
All I know, it's not IBS.

614
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:06,900
Or endometriosis.

615
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,600
Or interstitial cystitis.

616
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,600
Kidney stones. Pancreatitis.

617
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,600
Bowel obstruction.

618
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:19,180
It hurts the worst right here.

619
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:19,180
There has to be a reason.

620
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:24,080
But I have been

621
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:24,080
poked, prodded,

622
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:24,080
scanned, cut open,

623
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,480
and no one ever

624
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,480
finds anything!

625
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:28,650
Lisa, I can't even

626
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:28,650
imagine your frustration.

627
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:32,390
Look, I don't need sympathy.

628
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:32,390
I need you to fix me.

629
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:34,560
We'll do our best.

630
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:36,650
Unfortunately,

631
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:36,650
that does require

632
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,590
more pokes, prods,

633
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,590
X-rays, scans.

634
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:42,260
Have at it.

635
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:44,160
Okay.

636
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:54,580
Hello, Miss Caine,

637
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:54,580
I'm April.

638
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,170
What happened

639
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,170
to your cannula?

640
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:59,520
Pulled it out.

641
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:59,520
Who knows what's really in it.

642
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:02,220
You don't need

643
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:02,220
the space suit.

644
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,160
One day. But for now,

645
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,160
it's a precaution we take

646
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,160
in the COVID ICU.

647
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:07,490
I don't have coronavirus.

648
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:07,490
No?

649
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:09,430
It's not real. Big scam.

650
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:13,260
Okay, but I can see

651
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:13,260
you are having

652
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:13,260
trouble breathing.

653
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,300
It's just the flu.

654
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,300
Get it every year.

655
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:19,070
Flu or not,

656
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:23,340
a little extra oxygen

657
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:23,340
might help you feel

658
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:23,340
more comfortable.

659
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:26,280
What do you say,

660
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:26,280
wanna give the cannula

661
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:26,280
another shot?

662
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,680
Fine.

663
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,680
Okay.

664
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:43,290
I saw him play,

665
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:43,290
couple of months ago.

666
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:43,290
On TV, that is.

667
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:47,030
You're a tennis fan?

668
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:47,030
I was that night.

669
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:47,030
Couldn't sleep.

670
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:49,970
His match was the only show

671
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:49,970
that was on at 2:00 a.m.

672
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:52,570
Hell of a player.

673
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:52,570
Is he gonna be okay?

674
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:55,600
Not sure. A-fib problem,

675
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:55,600
don't know why.

676
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:59,040
I'm a cardiologist,

677
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:59,040
can I help?

678
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,280
Thanks, but technically,

679
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,280
you're limited

680
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:07,180
to seeing patients

681
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:07,180
who're part of your

682
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:07,180
clinical trial.

683
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:08,480
Totally understand.

684
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:13,290
I cauterized

685
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:13,290
the active bleeders.

686
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:15,260
Should help

687
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:15,260
stem the tide.

688
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:21,160
Kid keeps asking me

689
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:21,160
if his career is over.

690
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:21,160
I didn't know what to say.

691
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,670
Neither do I.

692
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,670
Thanks.

693
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,700
Dr. Virani?

694
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:37,450
I reconsidered.

695
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:37,450
I'll send you the chart.

696
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:43,690
Hey.

697
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:47,790
What's this?

698
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:47,790
That is a Persian

699
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:47,790
spice set.

700
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,650
Gift from your mom.

701
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,650
Oh.

702
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:53,290
Even comes

703
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:53,290
with an array

704
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:53,290
of popular recipes.

705
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,340
Oh, this is awkward.

706
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:57,200
I'm Iranian.

707
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:57,200
We love to cook.

708
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:59,430
It's a wonderful gift,

709
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:59,430
thoughtful.

710
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:01,530
Never got a gesture like that

711
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:01,530
from my ex in-laws.

712
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,770
What do you mean?

713
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:05,540
A Persian,

714
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:05,540
Zoroastrian son-in-law

715
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:08,050
is not what they had

716
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:08,050
in mind for their

717
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:08,050
Southern belle.

718
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:10,240
From the little

719
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:10,240
I know about Claire,

720
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:11,750
you two seem

721
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:11,750
pretty different, so...

722
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:13,510
Yeah, opposites attract,

723
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:13,510
I guess.

724
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:14,750
Didn't keep us

725
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:14,750
together, though.

726
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,250
Uh, is that Lisa's

727
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,250
latest test results?

728
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,450
Yes, her labs

729
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,450
are all normal.

730
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,700
Same with the KUB

731
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,700
and trans-vaginal

732
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,700
ultrasound.

733
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,730
Next step is a CT.

734
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:29,570
I'll squeeze that into

735
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:29,570
my locker and meet

736
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:29,570
you upstairs. All right?

737
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:34,800
Sharon, you know the ED's

738
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:34,800
hurting for staffing.

739
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:34,800
Mmm-hmm.

740
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:37,340
But at the same time,

741
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:37,340
with the pandemic,

742
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,710
nursing and med school

743
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,710
enrollments have surged.

744
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:41,780
A silver lining.

745
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:41,780
Mmm-hmm.

746
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:46,620
I was thinking we expand

747
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:46,620
the ED training programs

748
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:46,620
to match demand.

749
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:50,850
Puts Med on the map

750
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:50,850
and we get helping hands.

751
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:50,850
Win-win.

752
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:53,460
I like it.

753
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:53,460
Write a proposal.

754
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,720
All right.

755
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,490
What's up?

756
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:59,460
I updated Med's protocols

757
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:59,460
for the pharma reps,

758
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:03,100
and Gwen's undoing them,

759
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:03,100
playing hero in the process.

760
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,870
And now,

761
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,870
all the reps owe her one.

762
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,110
No doubt, she'll enjoy

763
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,110
using that against me.

764
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:17,810
My smile

765
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:17,810
convincing enough?

766
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:17,810
Very professional.

767
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,110
Mmm.

768
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:24,280
Grand mal seizure.

769
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:27,360
Five of Ativan.

770
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:27,360
Yep.

771
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:40,800
Mr. McIntyre,

772
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:40,800
you just had a seizure.

773
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:43,340
Terri?

774
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,470
Terri! Terri,

775
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,470
where are you?

776
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:50,380
Terri? Oh, there you are.

777
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:52,650
There you are.

778
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:54,910
Thank God.

779
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:04,860
A tumor?

780
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:07,530
In your brain's vision center,

781
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:07,530
the left occipital lobe.

782
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,430
It's caused your seizure

783
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:12,300
and it's safe to assume

784
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:12,300
an earlier one led

785
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:12,300
to your car accident.

786
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:16,370
Vision center, the...

787
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:16,370
That's also why...

788
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,470
That's right.

789
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,470
The tumor created

790
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,470
a blind spot, right?

791
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:23,350
And in order to make sense

792
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:23,350
of that void,

793
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:26,350
your brain has been

794
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:26,350
filling it in with

795
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:26,350
images of your wife.

796
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:29,390
Now, Liam,

797
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:29,390
I know "brain tumor"

798
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:29,390
can sound overwhelming,

799
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:30,750
but yours

800
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:30,750
is treatable.

801
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,750
Surgery.

802
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:35,760
Right.

803
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:35,760
It'll eliminate the risk

804
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:35,760
of another seizure

805
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:38,260
and it'll correct

806
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:38,260
your peripheral

807
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:38,260
vision loss.

808
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:40,200
But I'd lose my wife.

809
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:43,600
She'd disappear.

810
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:45,500
Yeah. I mean,

811
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:48,840
you would no longer see

812
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:48,840
those images of her.

813
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:57,310
I don't want the operation.

814
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:01,550
Mr. McIntyre,

815
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:01,550
without the surgery,

816
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:01,550
you will have more seizures.

817
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,450
And they'll be more severe.

818
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,650
You could even lose

819
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,650
your eyesight entirely.

820
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:11,230
When Terri died,

821
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:11,230
I was lost.

822
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:16,930
But now, it's like

823
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:16,930
I've got her back again.

824
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:22,530
She's everything to me.

825
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,300
You know that

826
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,300
I understand

827
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:28,780
how grateful you are

828
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:28,780
to have Terri

829
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:28,780
back in your life,

830
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,350
but another seizure,

831
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:34,790
probably put you

832
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:34,790
into a coma.

833
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:34,790
It would kill you.

834
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:37,980
Since Terri died, I haven't

835
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:37,980
really been living, anyway.

836
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:41,660
I wanna go home.

837
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,430
Mr. McIntyre,

838
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,430
I can't in good conscience,

839
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:45,900
discharge you

840
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:45,900
without a treatment plan.

841
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:50,800
I'll sign whatever I have to.

842
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:50,800
I just wanna be with my wife.

843
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:52,330
You know,

844
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:55,670
we will get the

845
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:55,670
paperwork going. Okay?

846
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:57,300
Thank you, Liam.

847
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:02,370
We're not letting him

848
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:02,370
go home.

849
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:02,370
I agree.

850
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,710
Okay. Psych hold, then?

851
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:07,880
Will, he's not mentally ill.

852
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:07,880
He's grieving.

853
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:12,720
I mean, we're asking him

854
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:12,720
to say goodbye to his wife,

855
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:12,720
you know? Again.

856
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,760
So, what's our play?

857
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:17,800
Honestly,

858
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:17,800
I don't know.

859
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:17,800
Hey, buy me a little time?

860
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:20,300
Yeah, I can slow-roll

861
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:20,300
his AMA paperwork.

862
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:21,830
Thank you.

863
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:21,830
All right.

864
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:31,070
You brought Dr. Virani in

865
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:31,070
on your case.

866
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,910
Needed a consult.

867
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:35,680
Usually, we call

868
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:35,680
Cardiology for consults.

869
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:39,950
No one upstairs has

870
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:39,950
London Heart Hospital

871
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:39,950
on their résumé.

872
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:44,460
So, I'm sure the resident

873
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:44,460
Cardiology would've sent down

874
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:44,460
will understand.

875
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:54,860
Dr. Lanik? Gina Caine,

876
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:54,860
in Three...

877
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:56,840
Oh. Miss "COVID is a hoax"?

878
00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:00,770
I upped her high flow O2

879
00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:00,770
and RT is ready to convert

880
00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:00,770
to a BiPAP,

881
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:04,000
but it's just delaying

882
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:04,000
the inevitable.

883
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:04,000
She'll need to be intubated.

884
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:05,910
Yeah, but is she

885
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:05,910
gonna give consent?

886
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:09,350
It's been tough just

887
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:09,350
keeping her on the cannula,

888
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:09,350
so, it's doubtful.

889
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:11,410
You better change her mind.

890
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:16,750
It looks like

891
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:16,750
there's mildly distended

892
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:16,750
loops of small bowel,

893
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:19,990
could be

894
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:19,990
a partial obstruction.

895
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:19,990
I'm not sure.

896
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:21,690
If it were an obstruction,

897
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,590
I'd expect the bowel

898
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,590
to be a lot more

899
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,590
dilated than it is.

900
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,700
So, what? We just

901
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,700
agree to disagree?

902
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,700
That doesn't help her.

903
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:29,840
Damn it. I know

904
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:29,840
something's causing

905
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:29,840
her pain. It's in there.

906
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:32,910
Just don't know

907
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:32,910
what it is,

908
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:32,910
can't see it.

909
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:36,870
Uh, Cara,

910
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:36,870
build the scan into

911
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:36,870
a hi-res 3D rendering.

912
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:40,100
Focus on the left flank,

913
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:40,100
where her pain is the worst.

914
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,650
Well, how about that.

915
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,410
Renal vein is compressed.

916
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:51,650
And it looks like it's

917
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:51,650
causing significant left-sided

918
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:51,650
venous congestion.

919
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:53,860
That isn't just painful.

920
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:54,950
It's excruciating.

921
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,530
Same drill as before.

922
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,530
Set up to cardiovert,

923
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:02,070
then 200 milligrams

924
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:02,070
of amio followed

925
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:02,070
by a drip.

926
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:05,140
A-fib with RVR,

927
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:05,140
replay on his intake.

928
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:05,140
Synced.

929
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,030
Clear. Hit it.

930
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:12,000
BP is coming

931
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:12,000
back up, 122/73.

932
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:13,910
Heart rate

933
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:13,910
settling, 140.

934
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:15,780
Still too high.

935
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:15,780
Add an esmolol drip.

936
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:18,850
It happened again?

937
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:18,850
My heart?

938
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:20,410
Yeah.

939
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:26,090
Doesn't make sense.

940
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:26,090
His heart's beating

941
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:26,090
irregularly,

942
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:28,160
but there's no evidence

943
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:28,160
anything is actually

944
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:28,160
wrong with it.

945
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:31,820
I looked at his chart,

946
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:31,820
the only other anomaly

947
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:31,820
is the nosebleed.

948
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,130
You think the nosebleed's

949
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,130
connected, then?

950
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:35,660
Could be.

951
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:38,830
I once treated a guy

952
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:38,830
who slipped in the shower

953
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:38,830
and dislocated his shoulder.

954
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:40,700
Random accident, right?

955
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:43,210
Turns out, he had

956
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:43,210
undiagnosed celiac disease.

957
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:45,780
A poor B12 absorption

958
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:45,780
leads to anemia...

959
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:48,680
Leads to weakness

960
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:48,680
in his feet, leads to

961
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:48,680
falling in the shower.

962
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,510
Nothing random about it.

963
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:55,450
Trini, repeat CBC,

964
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:55,450
BMP, cardiac labs,

965
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:55,450
echo, leave the EKG.

966
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:57,750
We're starting over.

967
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:04,960
This is the reason?

968
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,660
The renal vein

969
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,660
is being compressed?

970
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,100
It's called

971
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,100
nutcracker syndrome,

972
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:10,700
because the pain

973
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:10,700
feels like

974
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,470
you're being squeezed

975
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,470
by a nutcracker.

976
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:15,010
All this time,

977
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:15,010
right there.

978
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:18,510
How'd all the other

979
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:18,510
doctors miss it?

980
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:22,510
It hides. Only get

981
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:22,510
to it by ruling out

982
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:22,510
everything else first.

983
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:28,050
I'm relieved to finally have

984
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:28,050
an answer, but my pain,

985
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:28,050
it's more than a squeeze.

986
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,590
I'm being crushed

987
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,590
by a car compactor.

988
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,860
Yes, we suspect

989
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,860
a compounding issue,

990
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,830
a second disorder

991
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,830
affecting the ureter.

992
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:36,590
Loin pain

993
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:36,590
hematuria syndrome.

994
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:40,560
So, misery on top of agony?

995
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:40,560
What's the fix?

996
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:42,860
Surgery, with two options.

997
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,770
First is a renal vein

998
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,770
transposition.

999
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:46,500
It'll relieve

1000
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:46,500
the nutcracker syndrome.

1001
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:48,910
But unfortunately,

1002
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:48,910
it may not do anything

1003
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:48,910
for the loin pain.

1004
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:50,170
Option two?

1005
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:51,710
Embolize the renal artery.

1006
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:53,840
This will help

1007
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:53,840
with the loin pain,

1008
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:56,140
but may aggravate

1009
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:56,140
the nutcracker.

1010
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:57,910
So, let's do both.

1011
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:00,150
The thing is,

1012
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:00,150
you can't do both.

1013
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:03,160
Together, they would

1014
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:03,160
put too much stress

1015
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:03,160
on the kidney's blood supply.

1016
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,220
The organ would fail.

1017
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:10,560
Then, no. To both options.

1018
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:14,630
Neither ends my pain,

1019
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:14,630
so, what's the point?

1020
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:17,260
Less pain could

1021
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:17,260
make a huge difference

1022
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:17,260
in your life.

1023
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:20,100
Zero pain is something.

1024
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:23,570
Everything else is

1025
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:23,570
just history repeating itself.

1026
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:27,580
Procedure after procedure,

1027
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:27,580
all of them colossal failures.

1028
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:31,140
I can't take another one.

1029
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:31,140
I will lose my mind.

1030
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:35,280
I am always going

1031
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:35,280
to live in pain.

1032
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,320
It's just time

1033
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,320
that I accept that.

1034
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:50,840
Hey. If you're busy,

1035
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:50,840
I could come back later.

1036
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:52,830
Oh, hell no.

1037
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:55,140
This case had me

1038
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:55,140
going in circles.

1039
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,670
Thank you very much.

1040
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,670
You're welcome.

1041
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:05,880
So, your day

1042
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:05,880
going any better?

1043
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:08,920
No, in fact,

1044
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:08,920
it fell off a cliff.

1045
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:11,320
Wouldn't have anything

1046
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:11,320
to do with these

1047
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:14,250
updated protocols

1048
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:14,250
I've been hearing

1049
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:14,250
so much about?

1050
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:16,190
The reps are angry with me.

1051
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:20,830
Defcon 1 with Gwen

1052
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:20,830
because I got

1053
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:20,830
the board involved.

1054
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:22,630
And then

1055
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:22,630
there's Michael,

1056
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:27,000
who thinks these protocols

1057
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:27,000
are solely because of him.

1058
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:31,800
And you don't think

1059
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:31,800
there's even a tiny bit

1060
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:31,800
of truth to that?

1061
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:34,680
Really? You, too?

1062
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:37,750
If it were any other rep

1063
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:37,750
at the center of this thing,

1064
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:40,180
you think it would've

1065
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:40,180
gotten quite this far?

1066
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:42,180
Probably not.

1067
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:46,150
He's my son, Daniel.

1068
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:51,320
When he started

1069
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:51,320
working here,

1070
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:51,320
I was so excited, but...

1071
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:57,030
I just don't know how,

1072
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:57,030
eventually, that doesn't

1073
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:57,030
get complicated.

1074
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:01,370
Yeah.

1075
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:01,370
Ain't that the truth.

1076
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:07,840
Well,

1077
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,380
I've got a hard decision

1078
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,380
to make.

1079
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:13,150
I'm here if you need me.

1080
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:15,880
Thanks.

1081
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:33,810
Montez's repeat labs

1082
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:33,810
all good,

1083
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:33,810
same for the repeat echo.

1084
00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:36,240
His heart's now

1085
00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:36,240
beating normally,

1086
00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:36,240
he's back in sinus rhythm.

1087
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,000
Yeah, but still

1088
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,000
no clue as to why

1089
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:40,810
it started beating

1090
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:40,810
irregularly, or now,

1091
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:40,810
why it stopped.

1092
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:42,970
Dr. Choi, Dr. Virani,

1093
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:42,970
it's Montez.

1094
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,150
What's happening?

1095
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:52,420
Coughing up blood, that's

1096
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:52,420
not a nasal or a cardiac

1097
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:52,420
problem, it's a lung issue.

1098
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:55,730
Yeah. They sound junky.

1099
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:55,730
We need another chest X-ray.

1100
00:28:55,930 --> 00:28:57,120
I'm falling apart!

1101
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:58,860
Hey. Just hang

1102
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:58,860
in there, Montez.

1103
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:04,170
X-ray up.

1104
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:08,140
Bottom of the right lung

1105
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:08,140
is partially whited out.

1106
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,040
Two prior chest X-rays,

1107
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,040
that wasn't there.

1108
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:11,340
No, but it is now.

1109
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:13,340
We need a CT.

1110
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:18,740
Hey.

1111
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:19,840
Got your text.

1112
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:22,050
All I've been hitting

1113
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:22,050
are dead ends.

1114
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:22,050
You got something?

1115
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,480
Yeah. Think so.

1116
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:27,390
Kidney is at

1117
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:27,390
the center of Lisa's

1118
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:27,390
pain problems. Right?

1119
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:30,160
There's not enough space

1120
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:30,160
for the blood and urine

1121
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:30,160
to flow smoothly.

1122
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:34,490
So, what if I were

1123
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:34,490
to move it to a place

1124
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:34,490
where there is?

1125
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:36,490
That's a massive

1126
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:36,490
undertaking.

1127
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,170
If you're willing

1128
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,170
to go that far,

1129
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:40,100
why not just remove

1130
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:40,100
the kidney altogether?

1131
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:41,770
Less risk of complications.

1132
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,140
Possibly. But there'd be

1133
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,140
a huge trade off,

1134
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,240
she'd be losing

1135
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,240
a perfectly healthy organ.

1136
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:51,510
I mean, look, if there were

1137
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:51,510
a better option, I'd be

1138
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:51,510
all over it. I'm just...

1139
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,510
I'm not seeing one.

1140
00:29:57,090 --> 00:29:58,320
A kidney transplant?

1141
00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:00,090
A kidney autotransplant.

1142
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:01,990
It's more like

1143
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:01,990
a relocation.

1144
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:04,360
The new positioning

1145
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:04,360
decompresses the renal vein,

1146
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:06,130
so, there's no more pressure

1147
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:06,130
on the ureter.

1148
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:10,160
So, it both addresses

1149
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:10,160
the nutcracker

1150
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:10,160
and the loin pain.

1151
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:16,770
I've been let down

1152
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:16,770
so many times,

1153
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:16,770
you're sure this will work?

1154
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,440
The theory is sound.

1155
00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:22,380
Look, I believe

1156
00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:22,380
it will work.

1157
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:29,490
Okay. I'll hope.

1158
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:31,380
Okay.

1159
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,430
Miss Caine,

1160
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,430
you need to be intubated.

1161
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:42,200
No tubes. You put people

1162
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:42,200
on that machine,

1163
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:42,200
and never take them off.

1164
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:45,100
It's part of the scam,

1165
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:45,100
so they can bill you forever.

1166
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,830
Just give me more oxygen.

1167
00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:48,870
That won't work.

1168
00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:48,870
COVID attacks your...

1169
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:50,410
It's not COVID!

1170
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:54,510
Gina. Okay. I'm not

1171
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:54,510
supposed to say this,

1172
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,280
but you're right.

1173
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,280
COVID is a hoax.

1174
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:00,320
It is. I know it is.

1175
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:00,320
About time you admit it.

1176
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:03,190
I couldn't say anything

1177
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:03,190
before because I don't

1178
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:03,190
wanna get fired.

1179
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:06,020
Can't go against

1180
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:06,020
the hospital machine.

1181
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,350
Exactly.

1182
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:10,120
Please, just agree

1183
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:10,120
to be intubated.

1184
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:11,560
Let me help you

1185
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:11,560
get past this flu,

1186
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,830
and then we can

1187
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,830
talk about the truth.

1188
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:15,830
Okay.

1189
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:17,130
All right.

1190
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:20,000
Dr. Lanik?

1191
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:20,000
Intubation in Three.

1192
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,270
Let me suit up.

1193
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,270
Copy.

1194
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,450
No, no, no,

1195
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,450
no, no. Gina?

1196
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:34,380
Dr. Lanik!

1197
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:34,380
She's crashing! No pulse!

1198
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:36,580
What do we got?

1199
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:39,550
Dr. Lanik?

1200
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:45,420
Bag her.

1201
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:47,260
I'm on it.

1202
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,300
Sats are dropping.

1203
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:04,210
What happened?

1204
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:04,210
She went into PEA.

1205
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:07,490
All right.

1206
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:07,490
Milligram of epi.

1207
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:07,490
Already in.

1208
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,650
What? You pushed meds

1209
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,650
on your own?

1210
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:11,220
You weren't gonna

1211
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:11,220
make it in time.

1212
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:12,920
You can't do that

1213
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:12,920
without a doctor's order.

1214
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:20,260
Got a pulse.

1215
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:20,260
Sinus rhythm.

1216
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:22,630
Sats are still

1217
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:22,630
terrible, though.

1218
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,230
Kit's ready.

1219
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,230
Sux and etomidate?

1220
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:27,060
Give me the tube

1221
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:27,060
and the blade.

1222
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:42,950
Paperwork's ready.

1223
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:42,950
It's now or never.

1224
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:50,390
I'm gonna leave.

1225
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:50,390
You can't stop me.

1226
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,590
Liam, I was just

1227
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,590
hoping that you

1228
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,590
would indulge me

1229
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:56,000
with one more minute

1230
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:56,000
of your time

1231
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:56,000
before we signed you out.

1232
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,700
Okay. What is it?

1233
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:00,530
Well,

1234
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:05,000
I told you about my wife.

1235
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:08,100
About CeCe and how

1236
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:08,100
she had recently

1237
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:08,100
passed away.

1238
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:11,080
Um, whenever I had

1239
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:11,080
a big decision to make,

1240
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:13,210
I mean, she was just

1241
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:13,210
always there. Right?

1242
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,590
And she made me

1243
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,590
feel safe that way.

1244
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:19,550
Was it the same

1245
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:19,550
for you and Terri?

1246
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:22,090
Yeah.

1247
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:22,090
Mmm.

1248
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:25,190
So, I guess

1249
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:25,190
my question is,

1250
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:29,030
how do you think

1251
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:29,030
that Terri would feel?

1252
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:33,070
I mean,

1253
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:33,070
about the surgery?

1254
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:36,400
What do you think

1255
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:36,400
that she would

1256
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:36,400
want you to do?

1257
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:48,550
Liam, I can see the way

1258
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:48,550
that you're looking at her.

1259
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:53,290
And I'm guessing that

1260
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:53,290
she is looking back at you

1261
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:54,380
the same way.

1262
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:59,330
She loved me.

1263
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:00,690
So,

1264
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,190
honor that.

1265
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:06,470
Honor that love.

1266
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:15,050
She would want me

1267
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:15,050
to have the surgery.

1268
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:18,310
Yeah. I think so, too.

1269
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:35,030
Look at that,

1270
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:35,030
bottom of the right lung.

1271
00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:37,160
You were right.

1272
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:39,430
Everything's connected.

1273
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:43,400
It's an arteriovenous

1274
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:43,400
malformation, AVM.

1275
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:45,410
An abnormal tangle

1276
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:45,410
of blood vessels.

1277
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:47,570
They tear easily,

1278
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:47,570
results in bleeding.

1279
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,410
The blood I was

1280
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,410
coughing up.

1281
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,410
Yeah.

1282
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:52,550
And for some,

1283
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:52,550
AVMs are a symptom

1284
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:52,550
of a genetic disease called

1285
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:56,450
Hereditary Hemorrhagic

1286
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:56,450
Telangiectasia, HHT.

1287
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:59,320
The hallmark of HHT

1288
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:59,320
is frequent nosebleeds.

1289
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:01,120
Also, recently,

1290
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:01,120
research shows

1291
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:04,130
that HHT patients

1292
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:04,130
have a predilection

1293
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:04,130
for a-fib.

1294
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:09,830
These initials, AVM,

1295
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:09,830
HHT, could I die?

1296
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:09,830
No.

1297
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:11,700
The conditions

1298
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:11,700
are treatable.

1299
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,810
Surgery, embolization,

1300
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,810
medication.

1301
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:16,300
I'm gonna admit you

1302
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:16,300
and figure out

1303
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:16,300
what the best option is.

1304
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,070
And my career?

1305
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:19,440
Can I still compete

1306
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:19,440
when I get out of here?

1307
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:21,770
Nosebleeds may continue

1308
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:21,770
to be an issue,

1309
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:25,750
but today should be

1310
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:25,750
the last time you see

1311
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:25,750
yourself in hospital.

1312
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:29,790
Get you back on the court,

1313
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:29,790
US Open awaits.

1314
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:40,290
April!

1315
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,100
So, Lanik

1316
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,100
just went on a rant.

1317
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,230
He was so pissed,

1318
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,230
I could barely

1319
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,230
understand him.

1320
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:48,430
But I did manage

1321
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:48,430
to make out

1322
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:48,430
"super reckless"

1323
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,870
and a threat to fire you.

1324
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,870
What happened?

1325
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,750
I pushed meds

1326
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,750
without his order.

1327
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:55,280
What? What were

1328
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:55,280
you thinking?

1329
00:35:55,450 --> 00:35:57,610
The patient was coding.

1330
00:35:55,450 --> 00:35:57,610
Lanik was still suiting up.

1331
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:00,690
What was I supposed

1332
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:00,690
to do? Let her die?

1333
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:00,690
Of course not.

1334
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:03,810
But does it mean...

1335
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:03,810
He told me to

1336
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:03,810
solve the problem.

1337
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,390
What would

1338
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,390
you have done?

1339
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,390
April, we are nurses.

1340
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,700
Just because

1341
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,700
we know what to do,

1342
00:36:08,830 --> 00:36:10,850
it doesn't mean

1343
00:36:08,830 --> 00:36:10,850
we have the authority

1344
00:36:08,830 --> 00:36:10,850
to do it.

1345
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:13,660
I did

1346
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:13,660
and I saved her life.

1347
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:22,670
Hey! Great work today,

1348
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:22,670
appreciate the help.

1349
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,540
I really enjoyed

1350
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,540
the challenge.

1351
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,480
Been a while since

1352
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,480
I've been on the

1353
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,480
detective side of a case.

1354
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:29,640
If you ever

1355
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:29,640
need me again, I'm in.

1356
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,610
Deal.

1357
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:34,350
And, uh, next time,

1358
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:34,350
I won't hesitate.

1359
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:39,520
Truth is, I was

1360
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:39,520
actually deflecting.

1361
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:43,920
I know you and Will are close.

1362
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:43,920
Just didn't want to overstep.

1363
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:49,370
If it helps, I find nothing

1364
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:49,370
untoward with me seeing Will

1365
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:49,370
and playing Chess with you.

1366
00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:51,200
Good to know.

1367
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:53,930
So, now that

1368
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:53,930
that's settled,

1369
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:56,740
how much brain power

1370
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:56,740
do you have left today?

1371
00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:03,440
Game on.

1372
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:06,750
All right.

1373
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:09,850
Hey.

1374
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:12,620
So, Lisa's gonna

1375
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:12,620
be sore for a while

1376
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:12,620
from the procedure,

1377
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:13,960
but her pain,

1378
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:13,960
no more.

1379
00:37:14,830 --> 00:37:17,800
That is fantastic.

1380
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:21,420
I was worried she was

1381
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:21,420
gonna have to add us

1382
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:21,420
to her list of failures.

1383
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:23,470
Yeah, I was, too.

1384
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:27,230
But we pulled it off.

1385
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:27,230
We're a good team.

1386
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:29,470
Yeah, I hope so.

1387
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:34,210
Oh. A wistful tone

1388
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:34,210
after a huge win?

1389
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:37,880
What's going on?

1390
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:37,880
No, I just, um...

1391
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:41,820
You know, we broke

1392
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:41,820
Lisa's cycle of pain,

1393
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:41,820
and put her on a new path,

1394
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:46,630
and I guess,

1395
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:46,630
I'm just wondering

1396
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:46,630
if you broke yours, too.

1397
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:48,930
I'm not following.

1398
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:50,620
I mean,

1399
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:50,620
you said this afternoon

1400
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:52,930
that opposites attract,

1401
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:52,930
and they do.

1402
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:54,800
They don't always

1403
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:54,800
stay together.

1404
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:55,890
Yeah.

1405
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:58,900
You know, Manning?

1406
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:03,300
The moment

1407
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:03,300
you came into my life,

1408
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:08,250
my history

1409
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:08,250
became just that, history.

1410
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:20,260
I love you, Natalie.

1411
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:23,790
I love you, too.

1412
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:36,400
Liam. Heard the surgery

1413
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:36,400
went really well.

1414
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,850
How you doing?

1415
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,850
How're you feeling?

1416
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:41,940
Lonely.

1417
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:45,340
She's gone for good now.

1418
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:50,320
You think so?

1419
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:50,320
I mean, for myself, anyway,

1420
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:54,450
I feel CeCe's presence

1421
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:54,450
all the time.

1422
00:38:56,900 --> 00:39:00,770
Honestly, I don't know

1423
00:38:56,900 --> 00:39:00,770
if they ever really leave us.

1424
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:10,770
I knew it.

1425
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:10,770
No. No,

1426
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:10,770
you did not know that.

1427
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:23,480
Michael.

1428
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:23,480
Can we not, Mom?

1429
00:39:24,890 --> 00:39:27,950
Son, let me talk to you.

1430
00:39:24,890 --> 00:39:27,950
Give me a minute.

1431
00:39:24,890 --> 00:39:27,950
Come here.

1432
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:35,730
I just wanted to let you know

1433
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:35,730
the board is backing out

1434
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:35,730
my protocol changes.

1435
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,570
There'll be

1436
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,570
a new memo tomorrow.

1437
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:40,470
And you were right,

1438
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:44,710
some of my motive

1439
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:44,710
was personal.

1440
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:47,810
Okay.

1441
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:47,810
You've got my attention.

1442
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:49,550
Sit with me a minute?

1443
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:59,120
You know, I always

1444
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:59,120
want you to succeed.

1445
00:40:00,530 --> 00:40:04,520
But this hospital

1446
00:40:00,530 --> 00:40:04,520
is my responsibility.

1447
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:07,830
And when those two things

1448
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:07,830
don't line up,

1449
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:10,530
that's a problem.

1450
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:10,530
I know.

1451
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,440
And that's

1452
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,440
not all on you.

1453
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:17,870
My ambitions,

1454
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:17,870
they're big.

1455
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,070
I push.

1456
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:24,850
So, when management

1457
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:24,850
pushes back,

1458
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:24,850
it stings.

1459
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:28,120
Yeah.

1460
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:28,120
But you're also my mom.

1461
00:40:28,690 --> 00:40:29,710
It just hits closer to home.

1462
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:30,810
Yeah.

1463
00:40:34,090 --> 00:40:36,720
And that's why

1464
00:40:34,090 --> 00:40:36,720
I've decided to leave Med.

1465
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:39,860
Really?

1466
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,030
I've been thinking

1467
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,030
about it for a while.

1468
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:45,940
You cast a long shadow.

1469
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,030
About time I get out

1470
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,030
from under it.

1471
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:53,410
I raised you right.

1472
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:56,850
I think you're making

1473
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:56,850
the right decision.

1474
00:40:57,050 --> 00:40:59,110
I want to stay

1475
00:40:57,050 --> 00:40:59,110
in the city.

1476
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:02,150
Kender has a presence

1477
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:02,150
at Northwestern.

1478
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,050
That's what

1479
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,050
I've put up for.

1480
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:07,690
Well, they'll be lucky

1481
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:07,690
to have you.

1482
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:07,690
Oh, thanks, Mom.

1483
00:41:07,890 --> 00:41:10,520
And I'm gonna miss

1484
00:41:07,890 --> 00:41:10,520
seeing you every day.

1485
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:11,890
I'm staying in Chicago.
