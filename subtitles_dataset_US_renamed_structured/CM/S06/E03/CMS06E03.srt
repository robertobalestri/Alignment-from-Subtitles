1
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:08,170
Your new chief

2
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:08,170
is Dr. Ethan Choi.

3
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:13,000
We're running a trial

4
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:13,000
at Med for an oral

5
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:13,000
heart failure medication.

6
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,270
Dr. Virani,

7
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:16,170
would you be willing

8
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:16,170
to talk about that offer?

9
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:18,670
Talking about myself

10
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:18,670
is not really my thing.

11
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:20,310
I consider myself

12
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:20,310
more of a stoic.

13
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:23,450
Big on hiding emotion.

14
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:23,450
That you?

15
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:25,680
Mom's moving us to Arizona.

16
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:27,550
Hasn't happened yet.

17
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:27,550
We'll figure it out.

18
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:31,060
I know your heart's

19
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:31,060
in this COVID battle,

20
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:31,060
but you can't go it alone.

21
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,990
They are sick,

22
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,990
and they are alone.

23
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:36,560
I'm not abandoning them.

24
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:45,000
I don't know what I'm

25
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:45,000
gonna do at lunch every day,

26
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:46,630
without talking to

27
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:46,630
your kids on FaceTime.

28
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:47,730
Oh, don't you worry.

29
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,670
I'll make sure Annie

30
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,670
still sends you her recipes.

31
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:52,240
Good.

32
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:56,320
You take care of

33
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:56,320
yourself, Mr. Booker.

34
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:56,320
You, too

35
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:00,250
Thank you so much

36
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:00,250
for everything.

37
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:11,560
Hey.

38
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:13,400
Dr. Manning.

39
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:16,100
You look so...

40
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:16,100
What's the word?

41
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,640
"Decontaminated."

42
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,640
Oh, why, thank you!

43
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:22,180
And I'm sensing

44
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:22,180
a temperature

45
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:22,180
on you of, what?

46
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,250
98.4? 98.5?

47
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:27,250
Oh, as a matter of fact,

48
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:27,250
you're wrong. 98.7.

49
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:28,370
Oh.

50
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,320
Yes, I tend to run

51
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,320
a little hot.

52
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,120
Oh, I'm sure you do.

53
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,490
And what was that?

54
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:39,760
With Crockett? Nothing.

55
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:41,520
Oh, no.

56
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:41,520
Hmm.

57
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:44,390
Ben and I have never

58
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:44,390
exchanged temperatures.

59
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,430
Stop it.

60
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:49,130
Grab your earbuds.

61
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:49,130
You are on Telemedicine.

62
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,800
What? No.

63
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:53,300
Sorry, everybody's

64
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:53,300
gotta clock in their hours.

65
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:56,500
Ugh, I hate working through

66
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:56,500
a computer screen.

67
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:56,500
It's so impersonal.

68
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:59,340
Well, just break the ice.

69
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:02,580
Ask them

70
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:02,580
for their temperature.

71
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,240
Oh, my God.

72
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:06,510
Dr. Choi, I just got off

73
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:06,510
with the Board.

74
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:09,290
They're concerned

75
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:09,290
about your projections

76
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:09,290
for next month.

77
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,550
I understand, but with Norris

78
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,550
shutting its ED,

79
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,720
we had to ramp up

80
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,720
for the influx of patients.

81
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:16,090
And I'm sure you're

82
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:16,090
doing everything you can,

83
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,830
but with the losses

84
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,830
we sustained

85
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,830
from treating COVID,

86
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:21,230
they're watching every penny.

87
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:21,230
I get it.

88
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:24,640
I can try to reassess some

89
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:24,640
protocols, maybe find

90
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:24,640
a few more beds.

91
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,380
Maybe you should

92
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,380
look at how you're

93
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,380
allocating your staff.

94
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,470
Look,

95
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,470
I know this isn't easy,

96
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:35,210
but if Norris' ED

97
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:35,210
can go under,

98
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:35,210
it could happen to us.

99
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,110
Yes, ma'am.

100
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:51,360
Hey.

101
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:54,460
Anna got her

102
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:54,460
algebra test back.

103
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,900
A-minus.

104
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,900
Wow, great.

105
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:58,460
I know.

106
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:00,910
Why does that sound like

107
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:00,910
a lead into something

108
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:00,910
much less pleasant?

109
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:06,350
The, uh, transfer to Arizona

110
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:06,350
came through.

111
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,720
I start in a month.

112
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:12,750
You already took it? I thought

113
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:12,750
we were gonna talk about this.

114
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:14,450
I can't pass this up.

115
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:18,490
You can't just take Anna

116
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:18,490
a thousand miles away

117
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:18,490
without discussing it with me.

118
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:21,390
There's a direct flight.

119
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:21,390
You can come see her

120
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:21,390
on the weekends.

121
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:26,900
Susan, it's a direct violation

122
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:26,900
of our divorce agreement.

123
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,640
We really want to end up

124
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,640
in court over this?

125
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,370
I know this is hard

126
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:34,170
and you guys have gotten

127
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:34,170
so close, but...

128
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:36,340
Look, I'm sorry,

129
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:36,340
but they need me

130
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:36,340
down in the ED.

131
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:38,780
We're just gonna have

132
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:38,780
to pick this up later, okay?

133
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:39,900
But I just...

134
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,590
Hey, what's so important?

135
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,590
I'm sorry to do this,

136
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,590
but I have to bring you

137
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,590
back down to the ED.

138
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:50,720
Is this about

139
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:50,720
my safety again?

140
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:51,850
That's part of it.

141
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:54,560
You've been

142
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:54,560
in the COVID ward

143
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:54,560
for over a month,

144
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,330
and we've had

145
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,330
a couple nurses

146
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,330
test positive.

147
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:57,800
All the more reason

148
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:57,800
for me to stay here.

149
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:00,430
It isn't just that.

150
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,240
I have to balance my staff

151
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,240
between wards.

152
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,810
Please,

153
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,810
I need you downstairs.

154
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:07,210
You know how important

155
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:07,210
this is to me.

156
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:07,210
Of course, I do.

157
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:09,370
We just discharged another

158
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:09,370
patient this morning.

159
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,810
I am helping people

160
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,810
get through this.

161
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:12,470
I understand,

162
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:12,470
and it isn't forever.

163
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,640
You can't do this.

164
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,640
I can, and I have to.

165
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:21,920
I expect you down there

166
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:21,920
in an hour.

167
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:39,240
Dr. Choi? Patients are

168
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:39,240
backing up into the lobby.

169
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,330
What do you want me to do?

170
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,340
Get Doris to double up

171
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,340
on room turnover.

172
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:46,340
April.

173
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,510
Dr. Charles,

174
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:54,720
I have a young woman in 6

175
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:54,720
who needs IV antibiotics,

176
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:56,790
but is a little anxious

177
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:56,790
about needles,

178
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:58,450
and I need

179
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:58,450
to move things along.

180
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,660
Think you and April

181
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,660
could give it a try?

182
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,620
Yeah, sure.

183
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:04,530
Whatever you say, Chief.

184
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:05,920
Thanks.

185
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,830
Everything all right?

186
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:13,600
No. Ethan yanked me off

187
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:13,600
the COVID ward.

188
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,270
Huh.

189
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,850
Despite knowing how I feel.

190
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:19,570
You, um,

191
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:19,570
want to talk about it?

192
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,640
There's nothing

193
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,640
to talk about.

194
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,650
Hi, I'm April.

195
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,650
I'm gonna start your IV.

196
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:31,720
How are you doing?

197
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:31,720
I'm Dr. Charles.

198
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:34,850
You must be Lisa.

199
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:37,400
Yes. Very nice

200
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:37,400
to meet you, sir.

201
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:40,730
That is quite an infection

202
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:40,730
you have there...

203
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,870
Listen, you don't

204
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,870
need to worry.

205
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:47,910
Everybody in here has been

206
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:47,910
tested negative for COVID,

207
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:47,910
just like you. Okay?

208
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:49,310
You mind if I have a seat?

209
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:51,070
Okay.

210
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:51,070
So...

211
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:54,450
In my experience,

212
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,750
the trick to this

213
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,750
whole business is

214
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,750
to talk about movies.

215
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,890
My favorite movie

216
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,890
happens to be Amadeus.

217
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,460
How about you?

218
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:06,790
Uh... I don't know.

219
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,490
Okay, um...

220
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,860
Well, then, how about books?

221
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:12,590
You been reading anything

222
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:12,590
good recently?

223
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:15,030
Uh...

224
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:17,770
I don't really read.

225
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:17,770
I work as a babysitter.

226
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:19,400
So, you must like kids, then?

227
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:21,900
Just breathe.

228
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:26,780
Yes, I take care of a boy

229
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:26,780
and a girl, Tommy and Bridget.

230
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,750
They're brother and sister,

231
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,750
ages eight and ten.

232
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:32,480
Got it.

233
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:36,750
So, is that "Bridget"

234
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:36,750
with a, uh, D or a T?

235
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:39,350
'Cause, you know, the Irish,

236
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:39,350
they spell it kinda weird.

237
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:40,450
Is it in?

238
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,790
Yep, all done.

239
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,090
Lisa,

240
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,090
somebody's gonna be back

241
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,060
to, uh, check up on you

242
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,060
in a second, okay?

243
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:47,530
Nice to meet you, Lisa.

244
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:56,740
That was odd.

245
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:56,740
It was odd.

246
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:57,970
But, I mean, come on.

247
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,710
Hospitals can be scary places,

248
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,710
especially, these days.

249
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:01,810
But I tell you what,

250
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,010
give me a heads-up

251
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,010
when her labs come in, okay?

252
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,490
Mmm-hmm.

253
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,490
I might want to

254
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,490
talk to her again.

255
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:06,920
Okay.

256
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:06,920
Thank you.

257
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,400
We see a lot of

258
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,400
heart failure here.

259
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,590
With some hard work,

260
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:18,890
I think we could

261
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:18,890
fill this trial

262
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,430
in a matter of weeks,

263
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,430
not months.

264
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,070
I like your enthusiasm.

265
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,100
I mean, I saw

266
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,100
the phase 2 results.

267
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:26,910
Ejection fraction

268
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:26,910
is up an average of 40%?

269
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:29,880
This drug could

270
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:29,880
be a game changer.

271
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,140
Morning, Mags.

272
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,140
Morning.

273
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:33,950
Uh, we're starting

274
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:33,950
the clinical trial today.

275
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,070
Okay.

276
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,670
Let me know if we get

277
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,670
any heart failure patients.

278
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:37,810
Oh, you're in luck.

279
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:40,010
We got one in 5 right now.

280
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,020
I'll let you know

281
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,020
how it goes.

282
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,020
Great.

283
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,420
Mags, I'd like you

284
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,420
with me on this one.

285
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:46,520
All right.

286
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:48,930
Mr. Esquivel?

287
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:50,090
Am I saying that right?

288
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:51,670
Si.

289
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,740
I'm Dr. Halstead.

290
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,740
How're you feeling?

291
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,910
Hard to breathe. Tired.

292
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,030
Mmm-hmm.

293
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:03,540
Yeah, he's got a right-sided

294
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:03,540
effusion. Gonna need a tap.

295
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:07,680
Sir, it says you've been here

296
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:07,680
before, for heart failure.

297
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:09,080
I have?

298
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,780
Yes.

299
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:12,580
And looks like

300
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:12,580
it's gotten a bit worse.

301
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:13,850
Are you taking

302
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:13,850
your medication?

303
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:16,050
Blue ones, white ones.

304
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:16,050
Good.

305
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,720
But they may not be

306
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,720
working well enough.

307
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:21,560
Here's the thing.

308
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:24,860
I'm actually involved

309
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:24,860
in testing a brand-new

310
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:24,860
heart failure drug,

311
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:27,770
and based on what I'm seeing,

312
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:27,770
I think you could be

313
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:27,770
an excellent candidate.

314
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:30,770
More pills?

315
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:30,770
Just one.

316
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:32,640
And it would help

317
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:32,640
your heart pump better.

318
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:36,240
Now, it is experimental,

319
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:36,240
and we don't have

320
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:36,240
a ton of data on it,

321
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:38,910
but what we do have

322
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:38,910
is extremely encouraging.

323
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:41,140
It will make me better?

324
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:42,840
I can't make any promises,

325
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:45,580
but in this trial,

326
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:45,580
three out of the four patients

327
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:45,580
get the medication.

328
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:48,620
As long as you are

329
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:48,620
one of them, we should

330
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:48,620
see results pretty quickly.

331
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,590
Uh, what do you say?

332
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:55,890
Wanna give it a try?

333
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:57,760
Okay.

334
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:58,960
Yeah?

335
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:02,230
I just want to make sure

336
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:02,230
you understand

337
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:02,230
what I'm proposing.

338
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:03,900
Whatever you say, Doc.

339
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:05,000
All right.

340
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:07,540
I'll be back in a minute

341
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:07,540
with the paperwork,

342
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,630
and we'll get you going.

343
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:14,740
Set him up

344
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:14,740
for a thoracentesis,

345
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:16,110
and I'll get you the list

346
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:16,110
of labs for the trial.

347
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:19,280
Yeah, but are you sure

348
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:19,280
he understood?

349
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:21,080
He didn't seem all there.

350
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:23,220
He seemed

351
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:23,220
cognizant enough to me.

352
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,880
I asked him twice.

353
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:26,930
Yeah, but you

354
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:26,930
said it yourself,

355
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:29,220
it's possible that he gets

356
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:29,220
into the control group.

357
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:31,230
He might not even

358
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:31,230
get the drug.

359
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:31,230
Right.

360
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:33,930
But the control group

361
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:33,930
gets the standard

362
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:33,930
of care regardless,

363
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,830
and after 12 weeks, everyone

364
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,830
gets put on the drug anyways.

365
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:40,070
He's making a good choice.

366
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,310
Baghdad?

367
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:53,780
Got a 28-year-old female

368
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:53,780
paramedic with a knife wound

369
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:53,780
in the right flank.

370
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:58,880
123/70, heart rate 82,

371
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:58,880
respiration's 26.

372
00:09:58,990 --> 00:09:59,980
COVID negative.

373
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,000
Lanik, Marcel,

374
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,000
you're up. Doris?

375
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,260
Yep.

376
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,260
I'll help.

377
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,730
Just keep doing it

378
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,730
that way, okay?

379
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:06,700
Check her belly for fluid.

380
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,060
Megan? What happened?

381
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,730
I was on call, and a guy

382
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,730
jumped out of nowhere.

383
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:13,070
Okay. All right,

384
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:13,070
we're gonna help you out.

385
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:16,970
Here we go, on my count.

386
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:16,970
One, two, three.

387
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:21,040
Okay, let's have a look.

388
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:24,120
How bad is it?

389
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,250
I've seen worse.

390
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:31,890
You two know each other?

391
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:31,890
Yeah, we've crossed paths.

392
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:34,360
Usually over a Sazerac.

393
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:34,360
Or three.

394
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:37,260
If you really wanted

395
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:37,260
to see me again,

396
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:37,260
you could have just called.

397
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,920
Don't.

398
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:41,060
Easy.

399
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:41,060
It hurts.

400
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:44,870
He always

401
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:44,870
could make me laugh.

402
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:46,770
Mmm. He's a funny guy.

403
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,040
Okay, no free fluid. Good.

404
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,940
Doris, type and cross

405
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,940
for 6 and 6.

406
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:56,280
Hang two uncrossed units

407
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:56,280
and call up for an abdomen CT.

408
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:56,280
Uh-huh.

409
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:57,980
Am I gonna need surgery?

410
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:01,850
It depends if it

411
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:01,850
got the kidney.

412
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:01,850
We'll see what the scans say.

413
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:05,720
Uh, If you can do it

414
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:05,720
without surgery...

415
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,790
My wedding's in two weeks.

416
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:11,360
You're getting married?

417
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:14,060
That's fantastic.

418
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:14,060
I'm happy for you.

419
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:15,160
Yeah.

420
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:17,170
Yeah, no, it is.

421
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:20,940
Could have been this one

422
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:20,940
if he wasn't so hard to land.

423
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:25,710
Well, all right.

424
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:25,710
We're gonna take good care

425
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:25,710
of you, all right?

426
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:27,140
Okay.

427
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,740
In the meantime,

428
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,740
lay off the street fighting.

429
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:35,050
I'll draw up some labs.

430
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:35,050
That's okay, Trauma's got it.

431
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,090
You don't get out of

432
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,090
Telemedicine that easy.

433
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,060
You two seem to know

434
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,060
each other pretty well.

435
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:45,290
Yeah, we had

436
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:45,290
some good times.

437
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,930
Lucky for her, she was

438
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,930
smart enough to get away.

439
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:54,910
Tell me, are there

440
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:54,910
any women in Chicago you have

441
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:54,910
not had a Sazerac with?

442
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:57,340
There's still a few

443
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:57,340
on my list.

444
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,740
Hmm.

445
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:06,950
Is this done yet?

446
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,680
Almost. Before you go,

447
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:10,880
Dr. Choi would like

448
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:10,880
to give you a supplement.

449
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,460
Why?

450
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,460
Your lab work

451
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:15,060
revealed you have

452
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:15,060
an extreme

453
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:15,060
vitamin D deficiency.

454
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:17,700
We get our

455
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:17,700
vitamin D from the sun.

456
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:20,100
You not been leaving

457
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:20,100
the house too much?

458
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,400
I do, to play

459
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,400
with the kids I babysit.

460
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,940
Right, of course.

461
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,940
Thomas and, uh, Brittany?

462
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:27,200
Yes.

463
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,300
Or is it Bridget?

464
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:33,250
Bridget. Yeah, Bridget.

465
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:33,250
Right, of course.

466
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:36,790
So, you got a nice park

467
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:36,790
you take 'em to?

468
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:36,790
Where do you go?

469
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,250
Different places.

470
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:41,790
Can you do this fast?

471
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:41,790
I need to get back soon.

472
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,220
Yeah,

473
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,220
of course we can.

474
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,490
You got a long drive today?

475
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:47,820
Where do you live,

476
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:47,820
just if you don't

477
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:47,820
mind me asking?

478
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,430
I don't know.

479
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:57,000
Just hang in there, Lisa.

480
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:57,000
We'll get you

481
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:57,000
out of here soon.

482
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:07,950
That poor girl is so scared.

483
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:10,040
It doesn't seem like

484
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:10,040
just a needle phobia.

485
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:14,350
Did she have any ID

486
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:14,350
when she came in,

487
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:14,350
or emergency contact info?

488
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,220
Nope.

489
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,220
What are you thinking?

490
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,450
She is extremely fearful,

491
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,860
but also, she repeats

492
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,860
her backstory

493
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,190
like she's on some kind

494
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,190
of robotic tape loop.

495
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,260
What do you mean?

496
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:27,360
Look, she doesn't

497
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:27,360
spend a lot of time

498
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:27,360
outside, clearly.

499
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:29,060
She could have

500
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:29,060
been abducted.

501
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,530
Maybe.

502
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,210
Or she could have

503
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,210
just been in quarantine

504
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,210
and scared of hospitals.

505
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:36,300
Well, you could be right,

506
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:36,300
but I really do think

507
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:36,300
we should look into it.

508
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,900
Okay.

509
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:39,380
Do what you can,

510
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:39,380
but she wants to leave,

511
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,280
so as soon as her bag runs,

512
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,280
I gotta let her go.

513
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:42,410
Ethan...

514
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:42,410
You're talking about

515
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:45,780
getting PD down here,

516
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:45,780
interviewing her,

517
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:45,780
checking out her story.

518
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:48,290
Then we could take a picture.

519
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:50,260
Have them run it through

520
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:50,260
the missing persons registry.

521
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:53,190
It's not ethical

522
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:53,190
to take a picture of her

523
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:53,190
without her consent.

524
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:54,790
I'll figure it out.

525
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,800
But if taking

526
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,800
a picture could save

527
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,800
this woman's life,

528
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:58,920
that's what I'm gonna do.

529
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:08,830
Okay, so, tell me,

530
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:11,040
how long have you been

531
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:11,040
feeling nauseous for?

532
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,810
A few days,

533
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,810
but it's getting worse,

534
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:15,040
and my heart's

535
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:15,040
been beating really fast.

536
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:18,020
Do you have any history

537
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:18,020
of diabetes,

538
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:18,020
heart or stomach issues?

539
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,990
I don't think so,

540
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,990
but I haven't

541
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,990
seen a doctor

542
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:22,520
since Dr. Kelson retired.

543
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:25,390
So, have you ever had

544
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:25,390
these symptoms before?

545
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:29,390
A few times.

546
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:29,390
My cousin thinks

547
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:29,390
I have an ulcer.

548
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:30,590
What do you think?

549
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:33,600
I don't really want

550
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:33,600
to speculate based

551
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:33,600
on such limited history,

552
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:36,030
so I do think

553
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:36,030
it's best that you come in

554
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:36,030
for some blood work.

555
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:40,230
Oh, I can't do that.

556
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:40,230
We're still in a pandemic.

557
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:44,210
The hospital is actually

558
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:44,210
very safe. We're taking

559
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:44,210
every precaution.

560
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:47,080
I'm sure,

561
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:47,080
but I'm of an age that...

562
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:50,120
I understand,

563
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:50,120
but with your symptoms,

564
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:52,150
I really do think

565
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:52,150
it's best that you come in.

566
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:56,490
I can't. I'm so sorry.

567
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:58,150
Okay, uh, you know what?

568
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:00,630
I will write you up some

569
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:00,630
anti-nausea medication

570
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:02,400
for the pharmacy

571
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:02,400
to deliver to you,

572
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:05,430
um, but in the meantime,

573
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:05,430
if your symptoms

574
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:05,430
do get worse,

575
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:07,970
I really need you

576
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:07,970
to call me back

577
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:07,970
immediately, okay?

578
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:10,300
Oh, I will.

579
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:13,030
All right, thank you. Bye.

580
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,110
Any luck?

581
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:20,440
PD ran Lisa's photo,

582
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:20,440
and they didn't get a match.

583
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:24,880
It is possible it never got

584
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:24,880
reported, which happens

585
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:24,880
more than you think.

586
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:27,480
What I don't get is

587
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:27,480
if she was

588
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:27,480
being held captive,

589
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:29,220
why would they let her

590
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:29,220
come here alone?

591
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:32,120
Her captor might believe

592
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:32,120
that she's been

593
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:32,120
so well-conditioned,

594
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:33,490
that she'd just

595
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:33,490
come right back.

596
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:35,960
Like brainwashed?

597
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:35,960
Yeah, think about it.

598
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:40,360
If your only reality is

599
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:40,360
what the people who are

600
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:40,360
controlling you say it is,

601
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,940
you wouldn't dream

602
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,940
of defying it.

603
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,960
Lisa's IV is finished,

604
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,960
and she's asking to leave.

605
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:48,100
Ethan, she might be

606
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:48,100
in trouble. We can't just

607
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:48,100
send her back out there.

608
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:50,440
Did PD make an ID?

609
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:50,440
She's not in the system.

610
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:51,600
Then I can't leave her here.

611
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:53,580
Hey, I gotta

612
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:53,580
tell you, I just...

613
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,280
My gut's telling me

614
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,280
that's not

615
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,280
the right move yet.

616
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:03,450
Can I go now?

617
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:07,690
We are done

618
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:07,690
with your medical

619
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:07,690
treatment, but...

620
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,260
The hospital is a safe place,

621
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:13,360
and it's our job

622
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:13,360
to protect you,

623
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:15,560
which means that if you

624
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:15,560
are feeling harmed or...

625
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:16,970
I want to leave.

626
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:19,340
Lisa, if anybody

627
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,200
is holding you

628
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,200
against your will...

629
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:22,300
Just let me go!

630
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,240
Okay.

631
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:28,350
Here's your

632
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:28,350
discharge paperwork.

633
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:28,350
Just sign at the bottom.

634
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:31,020
What do I do with this?

635
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,420
Why don't you, um, let us

636
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,420
print that out for you, okay?

637
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:38,690
Be right back.

638
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:41,990
Okay, look.

639
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:45,490
iPad's been around

640
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:45,490
for how long?

641
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:45,490
What, like, ten years?

642
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,660
Something like that.

643
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,660
Yeah. She had no idea

644
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,660
what this was.

645
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:52,400
Listen, we've been

646
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:52,400
looking all along

647
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:52,400
for a missing adult,

648
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:55,310
and maybe what we

649
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:55,310
should have been looking for

650
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:55,310
is a missing child.

651
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,740
Wait, what are you

652
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,740
talking about?

653
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,140
What if she was abducted

654
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,140
years ago?

655
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,040
When she was a kid?

656
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,040
It'd be

657
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,040
totally possible.

658
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:01,510
She hasn't indicated

659
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:01,510
that she's in trouble,

660
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:02,710
and she's not asking

661
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:02,710
for our help.

662
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,110
We have no grounds

663
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,110
to keep her.

664
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:05,380
She could be in danger.

665
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:07,390
I don't understand

666
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:07,390
why you just...

667
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:07,390
I'm sorry.

668
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:16,320
Buddy. I understand

669
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:16,320
the kind of pressure

670
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:16,320
you're under.

671
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:17,760
Really, I do.

672
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:21,130
But are you sure this is how

673
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:21,130
you want to run your ED?

674
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,540
Give us an hour.

675
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:30,410
Okay, all set.

676
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,580
Good.

677
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,580
Dad?

678
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,280
Are you okay?

679
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:38,380
Mari?

680
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:44,320
What happened?

681
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:51,760
Hi, I'm Dr. Halstead.

682
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:54,590
Your father just had a flare

683
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:54,590
of pulmonary edema.

684
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:57,190
Caused him

685
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:57,190
some trouble breathing,

686
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:57,190
but he's doing okay now.

687
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:59,210
Oh, God, it keeps

688
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:59,210
getting worse.

689
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:01,500
Yeah, fortunately,

690
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:01,500
I was able to sign him up

691
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:03,200
for a brand-new

692
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:03,200
clinical trial.

693
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:04,570
I think it's really

694
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:04,570
gonna help.

695
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,340
What, like an experiment?

696
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:08,350
I wouldn't characterize it

697
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:08,350
like that.

698
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:11,780
It's an opportunity

699
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:11,780
for a new medication,

700
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:11,780
and he said he wants it.

701
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:13,420
He can't make

702
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:13,420
a decision like that.

703
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,390
There's not much

704
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,390
to decide, really.

705
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:18,360
He takes a pill a day

706
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:18,360
and comes in twice a week,

707
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:18,360
so we can check his blood...

708
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:22,090
Twice a week?

709
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:22,090
I'm his sole caretaker,

710
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:22,090
and I work. There's no way.

711
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,760
His cardiologist said

712
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,760
he should be evaluated

713
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,760
for something called an LVAD.

714
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:28,170
That's a surgical procedure.

715
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,630
Given his age and

716
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,630
ventricular insufficiency,

717
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:32,210
I do not think

718
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:32,210
he'd be a good candidate.

719
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:34,330
He's already taken

720
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:34,330
the first dose of medication.

721
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,170
If we can just give it

722
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,170
a little time...

723
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,770
I'm sorry,

724
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,770
we're not interested.

725
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:40,450
If you could please

726
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:40,450
call someone down

727
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:42,850
and have him evaluated for

728
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:42,850
the LVAD, I'd appreciate it.

729
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:47,410
Ms. Esquivel, please...

730
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:47,410
Doctor.

731
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,080
That's what we want.

732
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:52,180
Okay, I will

733
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:52,180
give them a call.

734
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:11,300
Megan's still here.

735
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:11,300
Does that mean her kidney

736
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:11,300
wasn't involved?

737
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:14,810
There's a laceration

738
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:14,810
on the inferior pole,

739
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,150
but IR was able

740
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,150
to embolize it.

741
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:18,650
The blush

742
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:18,650
looks pretty large.

743
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:21,880
You sure

744
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:21,880
that'll cover it?

745
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:21,880
I, uh, think it will.

746
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:24,180
And you got Lanik

747
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:24,180
to agree not to operate?

748
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:26,360
It took a little convincing.

749
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:30,160
By someone working

750
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:30,160
very hard to carry out

751
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:30,160
his special friend's wishes?

752
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:32,700
You nailed me.

753
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:32,700
I'm a helpless

754
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:32,700
pushover, man.

755
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,770
Mmm. Really, though,

756
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,770
don't you think you're being

757
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,770
a little conservative?

758
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:39,270
If her pressure drops,

759
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:39,270
then you'll be taking an

760
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:39,270
unstable patient into surgery.

761
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:40,530
I'm sorry, have we met?

762
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,670
'Cause Dr. Natalie Manning

763
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,670
doesn't usually advocate

764
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,670
for surgery.

765
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:47,380
But thank you.

766
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:47,380
Always appreciate

767
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:47,380
a colleague's input.

768
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:49,240
Anytime.

769
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:50,740
Always.

770
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:55,480
This is impossible.

771
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:56,850
We're never

772
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:56,850
gonna find her.

773
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:03,230
Ethan should never have

774
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:03,230
taken me off the COVID ward.

775
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:05,890
At least there, I felt like

776
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:05,890
I was doing something,

777
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,640
having an impact.

778
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,640
You felt, uh...

779
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,400
Felt a real purpose.

780
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:12,270
Yeah.

781
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:15,370
I can see how that

782
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:15,370
would be hard,

783
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:16,840
leaving that behind.

784
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:20,850
But, um, I've known you

785
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:20,850
for a long time,

786
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:26,390
and it seems to me,

787
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:26,390
you make yourself pretty damn

788
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:26,390
useful wherever you are.

789
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:30,660
Yeah, but this was different.

790
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:30,660
I felt like I was finally...

791
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:38,330
I don't know,

792
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:38,330
I found myself.

793
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:38,330
Who I am.

794
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:41,760
Yeah.

795
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:41,760
And Ethan took

796
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:41,760
that away from me.

797
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,510
Have you found a match?

798
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,580
It's tricky, as we have

799
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,580
no idea what she looked like

800
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,670
when she was a kid.

801
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,270
Send me her pic.

802
00:20:57,420 --> 00:21:00,390
I found a face app

803
00:20:57,420 --> 00:21:00,390
that can de-age it.

804
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:04,290
If she was abducted,

805
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:04,290
it might help us

806
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:04,290
find a match.

807
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,440
It's a long shot, but...

808
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:26,380
She looks familiar.

809
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:26,380
Wait.

810
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:32,550
That's Kelly, um...

811
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:32,550
Kelly Bissett.

812
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:34,480
From Wheaton.

813
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:39,020
Disappeared

814
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:39,020
a bunch of years ago.

815
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:39,020
It was all over the news.

816
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:40,720
Wait.

817
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:48,030
Kelly Bissett.

818
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:48,030
Wheaton, Illinois.

819
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:50,900
That's her.

820
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,800
April, make sure

821
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,800
she doesn't leave.

822
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,800
I'll call PD.

823
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:06,780
Dr. Marcel?

824
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:06,780
Yeah?

825
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:08,320
Her pressure's dropping.

826
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,460
Hey, how are you feeling?

827
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,050
I'm kind of lightheaded.

828
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,660
Let's have a look.

829
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,370
It's a problem.

830
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,370
What is it?

831
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:28,770
Got blood in her Foley.

832
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,350
Call upstairs. We gotta

833
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,350
get her up to the OR now.

834
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:33,480
Wait. What's going on?

835
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:33,480
Hey.

836
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:36,070
Your kidney's still bleeding.

837
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:36,070
There could be serious damage.

838
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:37,510
What are you gonna do?

839
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:38,640
We might have

840
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:38,640
to remove it.

841
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:40,610
I'm sorry, Megan.

842
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:44,950
Okay. Do whatever

843
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:44,950
you have to do.

844
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:55,700
Miss Webb.

845
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:58,060
Dr. Manning. How are you?

846
00:22:58,410 --> 00:22:59,740
I'm fine. But how are you?

847
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:02,630
You told me to call

848
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:02,630
if I had more symptoms.

849
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:03,730
Right.

850
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:09,980
My hands are kind of tingly

851
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:09,980
and numb. And it feels

852
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:09,980
weird moving my arms.

853
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,990
How long has this

854
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,990
been going on for?

855
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,990
About an hour.

856
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:15,850
Is it something bad?

857
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:15,850
I don't know.

858
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,720
But I do really

859
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,720
need you to come in now.

860
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:20,060
No, please.

861
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:23,060
Uh, can you just ask me

862
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:23,060
a few more questions?

863
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,720
I'm gonna need more

864
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,720
information than that.

865
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,720
Run tests.

866
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,890
This is an odd combination

867
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,890
of symptoms.

868
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,770
I wanna make sure

869
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,770
I'm not missing anything.

870
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:32,770
Maybe, if we just give it

871
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:32,770
a little more time?

872
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:34,640
Why don't I do some more

873
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:34,640
research on this,

874
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:36,610
and I will give you

875
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:36,610
a call back. Okay?

876
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:38,010
But if this gets worse,

877
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:39,910
I need you to promise me

878
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:39,910
that you'll come in.

879
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,780
But you'll definitely

880
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,780
call me back?

881
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:44,010
Absolutely. Okay?

882
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:46,650
Thank you.

883
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:46,650
Of course, bye.

884
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:59,120
Good news. Your father's sats

885
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:59,120
are looking better.

886
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:04,830
Okay, but cardiology

887
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:04,830
still hasn't come by.

888
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:04,830
Have you heard anything?

889
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:06,770
Yeah, I apprised them

890
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:06,770
of the situation,

891
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:08,740
but I did tell them

892
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:08,740
to hold off on coming down.

893
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:12,170
Wait. What? Why?

894
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:15,040
I wanted to see if he would

895
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:15,040
improve, and he did.

896
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:17,150
His ejection fraction

897
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:17,150
is up four percent.

898
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:17,150
His heart...

899
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:19,680
I made it very clear

900
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:19,680
what I wanted.

901
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:22,820
I know. I wanted to

902
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:22,820
get his echo results in...

903
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,980
How much do they

904
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,980
pay him for this trial?

905
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,980
Maria...

906
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,890
Forget it. I'm calling

907
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,890
his cardiologist.

908
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,190
No, no, no. Please. Hey,

909
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,190
you're making a big mistake...

910
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,560
Dr. Halstead.

911
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,560
Trini, come here.

912
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:35,170
Miss Esquivel?

913
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:35,170
Please, just...

914
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:36,870
Dr. Halstead?

915
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:42,540
What are you doing?

916
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:42,540
She was very clear

917
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:42,540
about what she wants.

918
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,980
She doesn't understand.

919
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,980
If an LVAD goes poorly,

920
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:47,810
he could end up stranded

921
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:47,810
on ECMO. That's a death

922
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:47,810
sentence, Maggie.

923
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,520
Are you sure that this trial's

924
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,520
not clouding your judgment?

925
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:53,050
Yes. This trial

926
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:53,050
is the best shot we have

927
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:53,050
at saving Ruben's life.

928
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:54,140
Dr. Halstead?

929
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:58,850
No, no, no! Stop!

930
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,620
He needs to stay in bed.

931
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,620
I'm taking him

932
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,620
to see Dr. Foster.

933
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:02,920
Papa!

934
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:02,920
Maria, get out of here.

935
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:06,200
He's in arrest.

936
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:06,200
Code Blue. Pulseless V-tach.

937
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,060
Oh, my God.

938
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,060
Paddles.

939
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,800
Paddles.

940
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:15,110
Charging to 200.

941
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:15,110
This is your fault!

942
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,480
Charged. Clear!

943
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:22,210
Papa!

944
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,510
Pulse rate?

945
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:26,150
Papa!

946
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:26,150
No pulse.

947
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:27,820
Compressions.

948
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:27,820
Charging to 200.

949
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:31,520
Please, Papa.

950
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:31,520
Charged, clear.

951
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:37,950
Pulse is back.

952
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:41,070
Is he alive?

953
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:41,070
Yes.

954
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,000
He's stable,

955
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,000
but unconscious.

956
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:47,970
At this point,

957
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:47,970
we're gonna

958
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:47,970
have to intubate

959
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:49,740
and then move him

960
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:49,740
up to the ICU.

961
00:25:52,810 --> 00:25:53,840
Maria!

962
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,270
It's okay.

963
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:02,120
Hey, we're trying

964
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:02,120
to help him. We are.

965
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:16,830
Claims she's not

966
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:16,830
the missing girl.

967
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:16,830
She's adamant.

968
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,770
Not surprising.

969
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:20,700
She's been terrorized

970
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:20,700
over the last 12 years

971
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:23,070
into completely erasing

972
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:23,070
her former identity.

973
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:26,080
It's not gonna be so easy

974
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:26,080
to just break

975
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:26,080
right through that.

976
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:28,780
Just look at her eyes.

977
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:28,780
It's her. You can see that.

978
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:31,710
It could be.

979
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:31,710
But without a statement

980
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:31,710
or physical evidence,

981
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:33,880
the detectives will

982
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:33,880
have to get a warrant

983
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:33,880
to check her DNA.

984
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:36,120
It's gonna take a while.

985
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:37,680
Thanks.

986
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:39,190
So, now, what do we do?

987
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:41,030
We gotta find her family.

988
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:43,790
And then what?

989
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:43,790
Lisa!

990
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,590
I've been here too long.

991
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,590
I have to go.

992
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:50,190
No, no, no. Lisa.

993
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:50,190
We can help you.

994
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:53,140
No, no, no. No.

995
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:53,140
I have to go.

996
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,870
Get out of my way!

997
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,870
Security!

998
00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:56,200
She's on a hold.

999
00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:56,200
Miss?

1000
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:57,840
What? No.

1001
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:57,840
What's going on?

1002
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:57,840
Please.

1003
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:00,180
I have to go. No! No!

1004
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,680
Take it easy!

1005
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:02,840
Please!

1006
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:04,640
Lisa? It's gonna be okay.

1007
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:07,690
No! No!

1008
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:29,130
Miss Bissett?

1009
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:29,130
I'm Dan Charles.

1010
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:29,130
You're the doctor who called?

1011
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:31,370
Yes.

1012
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:31,370
And this is April Sexton.

1013
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:31,370
Hello.

1014
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:34,010
I just want you to know

1015
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:34,010
that we get tested

1016
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:34,010
at the hospital every day.

1017
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:35,170
And we're both negative.

1018
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:35,170
It's all right.

1019
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:39,150
I'm tested weekly myself.

1020
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:39,150
And I work from home.

1021
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:40,950
It's so cold.

1022
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:40,950
Please. Come in.

1023
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:43,080
Thank you.

1024
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:51,360
I don't know why

1025
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:51,360
I've agreed to see you.

1026
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:51,360
My daughter's gone.

1027
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,000
Whoever's in your

1028
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,000
hospital isn't her.

1029
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:55,790
How can you be so sure?

1030
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,870
Because I've been

1031
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,870
dealing with them for years,

1032
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,870
these imposters.

1033
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:02,240
Some want money,

1034
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:02,240
some want attention.

1035
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:04,770
Actually, she's not even

1036
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:04,770
claiming to be your daughter.

1037
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,180
What? Then why

1038
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,180
are you even here?

1039
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:10,910
She does present

1040
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:10,910
as somebody who has been

1041
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:10,910
in captivity for many years.

1042
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:12,950
So just some crazy person?

1043
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:14,410
Not really.

1044
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,850
Um, and there's a photo

1045
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,850
we'd like to show you.

1046
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,720
I don't want to see

1047
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,720
any more pictures.

1048
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:20,290
Please, just take a look.

1049
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:23,250
Please.

1050
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:30,270
That's not Kelly.

1051
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:30,270
My Kelly had birthmarks.

1052
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:33,240
She had a scar on her hand,

1053
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:33,240
where she had a bike accident.

1054
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:36,210
It would be so helpful

1055
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:36,210
if you came with us

1056
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:36,210
to the hospital,

1057
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:37,870
and saw her

1058
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:37,870
with your own eyes.

1059
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:41,280
I'm not doing this again.

1060
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:41,280
I can't take it.

1061
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:44,420
My daughter is gone.

1062
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,050
May I?

1063
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,790
The pictures have faded...

1064
00:28:58,170 --> 00:28:59,860
Miss Bissett, I wish

1065
00:28:58,170 --> 00:28:59,860
you'd reconsider.

1066
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:03,070
We know how painful this

1067
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:03,070
must be for you, which is

1068
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:03,070
why we wouldn't be here...

1069
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:04,160
No.

1070
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:08,400
I'm done chasing ghosts.

1071
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:14,820
We're sorry to have

1072
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:14,820
bothered you.

1073
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:21,290
Will. You cannot go in there.

1074
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:23,320
Ruben still has runs

1075
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:23,320
of V-tach.

1076
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:24,790
Has a cardiologist

1077
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:24,790
seen him?

1078
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:25,950
No. They're backed up.

1079
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:27,250
He needs a stellate

1080
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:27,250
ganglion block

1081
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,230
right now.

1082
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,230
Will!

1083
00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:31,260
Ruben's daughter had you

1084
00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:31,260
taken off the case.

1085
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:39,930
Miss Esquivel...

1086
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:39,930
Will...

1087
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,300
You are not

1088
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,300
his doctor anymore.

1089
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,770
I understand.

1090
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,770
But this is an emergency.

1091
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,070
Your father's

1092
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,070
in a dangerous arrhythmia.

1093
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:48,440
I want to do what's called

1094
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:48,440
a stellate ganglion block.

1095
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,940
Inject a small anesthetic

1096
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,940
into nerves in his neck.

1097
00:29:51,050 --> 00:29:53,850
Is this a part

1098
00:29:51,050 --> 00:29:53,850
of your trial?

1099
00:29:51,050 --> 00:29:53,850
No, it's not.

1100
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,490
But if it works, it will help

1101
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,490
convert his heart back

1102
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,490
into a safe rhythm.

1103
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:59,030
It would save his life.

1104
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:59,030
I don't trust you.

1105
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,120
No.

1106
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,120
Maria.

1107
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,830
Dr. Halstead is one

1108
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,830
of the best doctors

1109
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,830
that we have here.

1110
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:06,300
Please, don't.

1111
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:06,300
I've had enough.

1112
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:11,340
Maria, if he thinks

1113
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:11,340
this is the best treatment

1114
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:11,340
for your father,

1115
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,430
so do I.

1116
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:19,340
Do you really trust him?

1117
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:22,410
I do.

1118
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:29,880
Fine. Do it.

1119
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:33,120
Okay.

1120
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,930
Thank you.

1121
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:45,800
When I inject, you need

1122
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:45,800
to stay completely still.

1123
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:48,100
If I'm even a millimeter off,

1124
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:48,100
I could hit the carotid.

1125
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:51,970
All right.

1126
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:54,910
There's the carotid.

1127
00:30:58,590 --> 00:30:59,580
Okay.

1128
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,110
Let's go.

1129
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:08,480
Can you see anything?

1130
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:10,600
Not yet.

1131
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:10,600
Angle it a little down.

1132
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:13,290
A little more.

1133
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,470
What is that?

1134
00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:20,370
He's having a run of V-tach.

1135
00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:20,370
Do you want the amiodarone?

1136
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:23,200
No, we got this. Keep going.

1137
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:23,200
What's happening?

1138
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:28,440
Dr. Halstead...

1139
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:29,850
Angle it up.

1140
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:33,080
Ay, Papa.

1141
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:36,250
He's in V-tach.

1142
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:39,620
He's gonna arrest.

1143
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:43,060
No! Keep going.

1144
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:43,060
A little more.

1145
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,290
Pressure's dropping.

1146
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:49,160
Do something! Save him!

1147
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:49,160
Okay, Maria.

1148
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:51,860
Almost there. Keep going

1149
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:51,860
a little more.

1150
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:54,400
Stop right there.

1151
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:54,400
I'm going in.

1152
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,270
Do not move.

1153
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,640
Got it. Pushing bupivacaine.

1154
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:07,380
Don't move. All in.

1155
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:10,920
Normal sinus rhythm.

1156
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:13,550
Okay, coming out.

1157
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:13,550
Don't move.

1158
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:17,650
Out.

1159
00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:36,980
How'd it go with the mom?

1160
00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:36,980
We struck out.

1161
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,110
Poor thing could barely

1162
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,110
look at the picture.

1163
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:55,190
Please, you have to

1164
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:55,190
let me go.

1165
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:04,270
Someone took you

1166
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:04,270
from your home.

1167
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:07,480
They took your family,

1168
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:07,480
your childhood.

1169
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,970
Everything you had.

1170
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:16,150
But what no one

1171
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:16,150
can ever take from you

1172
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:16,150
is who you are.

1173
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:26,560
This is yours, isn't it?

1174
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:42,710
Are you Kelly Bissett?

1175
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,150
It's okay.

1176
00:33:54,090 --> 00:33:57,330
It's okay. It's okay.

1177
00:33:54,090 --> 00:33:57,330
It's okay.

1178
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:18,310
It's so nice to hear

1179
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:18,310
from you, Dr. Manning.

1180
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:20,790
I have been searching

1181
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:20,790
for possible diagnoses.

1182
00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:24,550
But without being able to

1183
00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:24,550
examine you, I just can't

1184
00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:24,550
narrow it down.

1185
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:28,390
I'm sorry. Even if I

1186
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:28,390
wanted to come in,

1187
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:28,390
I couldn't.

1188
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,090
My son used to drive me,

1189
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:32,790
but he moved to Colorado

1190
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:32,790
a few months ago.

1191
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:36,260
He barely calls,

1192
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:36,260
and never Zooms.

1193
00:34:36,470 --> 00:34:40,200
I understand. If anything

1194
00:34:36,470 --> 00:34:40,200
changes or gets worse, I...

1195
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:42,740
Oh, actually,

1196
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:42,740
there is one more symptom.

1197
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:50,140
My urine is red. I mean,

1198
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:50,140
it's really red.

1199
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:50,140
Like the color of wine.

1200
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:52,250
Hang on one second.

1201
00:34:57,820 --> 00:35:01,760
Miss Webb, have you

1202
00:34:57,820 --> 00:35:01,760
ever heard of something

1203
00:34:57,820 --> 00:35:01,760
called ALAD porphyria?

1204
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:03,650
I don't think so.

1205
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:09,430
It's a very rare

1206
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:09,430
genetic disease,

1207
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:09,430
only ten cases reported ever.

1208
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:12,270
And your symptoms

1209
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:12,270
match the diagnosis.

1210
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:15,070
Really?

1211
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:15,070
To a T.

1212
00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:17,770
But if you actually had it,

1213
00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:17,770
you would look a lot more ill.

1214
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,750
Oh.

1215
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:21,740
"Urine the color of wine."

1216
00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:25,080
That's exactly how it's

1217
00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:25,080
described in the literature.

1218
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:28,280
I'm sorry to do this,

1219
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:28,280
but I have to ask.

1220
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:30,650
Do you really

1221
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:30,650
have these symptoms?

1222
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:34,560
Or are you just reading

1223
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:34,560
about porphyria online?

1224
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:38,090
The nausea was real.

1225
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:44,400
But I tried to call

1226
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:44,400
my son to ask him,

1227
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:44,400
but he didn't have time.

1228
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:48,870
So, I started looking up

1229
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:48,870
possible causes, and...

1230
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:55,640
No. I don't have

1231
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:55,640
the symptoms.

1232
00:35:57,850 --> 00:36:00,250
I'm sorry I wasted your time.

1233
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,420
Miss Webb?

1234
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:07,250
Yes?

1235
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,290
I miss my son, too.

1236
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:12,690
He's five.

1237
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:17,640
I had to move out

1238
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:17,640
because of the pandemic.

1239
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:20,800
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1240
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:20,800
What's his name?

1241
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:23,540
Owen. You wanna see

1242
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:23,540
a picture of him?

1243
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:27,370
Yes, I do.

1244
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:27,370
Here he is.

1245
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:31,180
He's adorable.

1246
00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:32,580
Mmm-hmm.

1247
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:36,720
Mine is named Richard.

1248
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:36,720
He goes by Rick...

1249
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:42,520
Mr. Esquivel,

1250
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:42,520
how are you feeling?

1251
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:44,490
Good.

1252
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:47,760
Great. Yeah,

1253
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:47,760
your rhythm is stable

1254
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:47,760
and your pressure's up.

1255
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:50,600
Hopefully, you won't have

1256
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:50,600
to stay with us much longer.

1257
00:36:51,770 --> 00:36:53,330
Take care.

1258
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:55,230
Dr. Halstead?

1259
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,680
I appreciate everything

1260
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,680
you've done.

1261
00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:04,840
So, if you think

1262
00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:04,840
your clinical trial is

1263
00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:04,840
the best thing for my father,

1264
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:06,250
I'd like to keep him in it.

1265
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:10,720
Thank you.

1266
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:10,720
And I wish he could.

1267
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:12,850
But the ganglion block

1268
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:12,850
disqualified him.

1269
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:16,900
Maybe down the road,

1270
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:16,900
we can revisit it again.

1271
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,630
But for now, I'm just glad

1272
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,630
he's doing better.

1273
00:37:34,010 --> 00:37:37,350
You knew all along

1274
00:37:34,010 --> 00:37:37,350
the block was gonna

1275
00:37:34,010 --> 00:37:37,350
disqualify him?

1276
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:40,250
It's what he needed.

1277
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:40,250
But here's the sad irony.

1278
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:42,410
All his numbers were up.

1279
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:42,410
Yeah.

1280
00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:46,290
Ejection fraction,

1281
00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:46,290
heart function. Maggie,

1282
00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:46,290
I think this drug works.

1283
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:50,260
Yeah. I shouldn't have

1284
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:50,260
questioned you today.

1285
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:53,530
Yeah.

1286
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:53,530
My bad.

1287
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,590
It's okay.

1288
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:00,410
You happy?

1289
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:04,680
Yeah. Yeah, I am.

1290
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:06,850
Good.

1291
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:11,270
So, uh, you think I'll be able

1292
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:11,270
to walk down the aisle?

1293
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:15,450
Oh, yeah. Just promise me

1294
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:15,450
no big dips during

1295
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:15,450
your first dance, yeah?

1296
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,820
Okay.

1297
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:20,980
Megan!

1298
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:22,450
I got the first flight back.

1299
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:22,450
Hi...

1300
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,930
Are you okay?

1301
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,930
Sweetie. I'm fine.

1302
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,960
I was crazy worried.

1303
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:28,700
Oh, God.

1304
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:28,700
I'm so glad you're here.

1305
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,500
Me, too.

1306
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,500
I'm okay.

1307
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,970
I just gotta take it slow...

1308
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:39,800
Nice work.

1309
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:39,800
Thanks.

1310
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:47,310
She's right through here.

1311
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:49,980
And you're sure

1312
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:49,980
it's really her?

1313
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,480
Absolutely positive.

1314
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:09,330
Mom?

1315
00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:29,020
April, I, um...

1316
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:32,760
Good work today.

1317
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:35,020
Thanks.

1318
00:40:00,890 --> 00:40:03,020
Hey.

1319
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,600
Tell me something.

1320
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:14,900
Why do you do it?

1321
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:14,900
The one-night stands.

1322
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:20,550
They all end up the same.

1323
00:40:22,050 --> 00:40:23,640
How's that?

1324
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:26,580
With you alone.

1325
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:34,130
Or maybe that's the point.
