1
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:07,570
Ramona Davis has been

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:07,570
trouble for a long time.

3
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:09,100
I have a confession

4
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:09,100
to make.

5
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:11,140
I did shoot myself

6
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:11,140
with a nail gun.

7
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:12,970
I'm concerned that

8
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:12,970
you're a danger to yourself.

9
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,480
You don't need to be

10
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,480
nervous around me.

11
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,010
I am very comfortable

12
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,010
around you.

13
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:19,070
I'm taking her blood

14
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:19,070
to an outside lab.

15
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:21,980
You're unblinding her

16
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:21,980
without the company knowing?

17
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,380
That's what

18
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,380
caused her seizure.

19
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:24,990
So, we won't need

20
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:24,990
to unblind her.

21
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:26,680
No, I don't think

22
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:26,680
it's necessary.

23
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:29,490
Her heart's

24
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:29,490
not pumping properly.

25
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:32,130
I thought we had

26
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:32,130
all this time together.

27
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:33,590
My clinical trial

28
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:33,590
is the best option.

29
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:36,360
You know the risks

30
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:36,360
of an experimental drug.

31
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:37,460
If this were

32
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:37,460
any other patient...

33
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:39,300
But it's not

34
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:39,300
any other patient.

35
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,630
It's my mom!

36
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:51,510
Everything okay?

37
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:51,510
Yeah.

38
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:56,240
I wanna jot down some notes

39
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:56,240
for our meeting tomorrow.

40
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:59,010
Mmm. It's gonna go great.

41
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:02,620
I just wanna make

42
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:02,620
a good impression,

43
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:02,620
you know?

44
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:06,620
Everyone at Kender is

45
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:06,620
already so impressed

46
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:06,620
with your work in the trial.

47
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:12,630
Because, you,

48
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:12,630
Dr. Halstead, are a star.

49
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,500
Well, thank you.

50
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:24,640
Okay, so,

51
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:24,640
I get that I'm grounded,

52
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:27,270
but why do I have to

53
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:27,270
come to work with you?

54
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:28,510
We need to talk.

55
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:29,810
You know I've been

56
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:29,810
working late

57
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,110
a lot recently,

58
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,110
that's on me.

59
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:33,590
But today, at lunch,

60
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:35,210
you and me are gonna

61
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:35,210
sit down and talk.

62
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,690
I thought we talked

63
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,690
plenty last night.

64
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:39,060
Honey, this is the third time

65
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,460
you snuck out of the house

66
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,460
in the middle of the night.

67
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,460
Third time in less

68
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,460
than a month,

69
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,690
in the middle

70
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,690
of the night,

71
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:45,360
I find your bed

72
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:45,360
stuffed with clothes.

73
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,300
Dad, you don't let me

74
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,300
go out and do anything.

75
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,300
I'm like a prisoner.

76
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,570
I'd love to give you

77
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,570
more freedom, but, you know,

78
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:54,800
that would require a certain

79
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:54,800
amount of trust, and pro-tip,

80
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,440
sneaking out of the house

81
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,440
ain't the way to get there.

82
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,080
This is so unfair.

83
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:00,410
I'm sorry you feel that way.

84
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,220
Ramona.

85
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,220
Hi, Dr. Charles.

86
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:07,680
What are you

87
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:07,680
doing here?

88
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:10,220
I've got my outpatient

89
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:10,220
psych clinic this morning.

90
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,120
I thought I'd stop by

91
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,120
and say hi.

92
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,520
Oh. Okay.

93
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:18,230
Is this your daughter?

94
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:18,230
Yeah.

95
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:20,670
Hi, I'm Ramona.

96
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:20,670
Anna.

97
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,400
Hey, don't you wanna

98
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,400
be getting upstairs?

99
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:26,870
You don't want to be late

100
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:26,870
for your appointment.

101
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,780
To be honest, I really

102
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,780
don't know if Dr. Lancaster

103
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,780
is helping me.

104
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,350
Hmm.

105
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,440
It's only been three weeks.

106
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:36,780
Probably a good idea

107
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:36,780
to give the process

108
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:36,780
a chance.

109
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:39,490
He's really very,

110
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:39,490
very good,

111
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:42,180
else, I never would have

112
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:42,180
recommended him to you.

113
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,820
It's nice to meet you.

114
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,790
Nice to see you.

115
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,230
She's weird.

116
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,410
Morning, Nat.

117
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,410
Morning.

118
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:06,810
How's your mom?

119
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,610
You know what?

120
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,610
She's doing good.

121
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,150
She has an appointment

122
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,150
with Dr. Young

123
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,880
to see how her

124
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,880
heart's doing with

125
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,880
the LVAD today, so...

126
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:14,880
Oh, I'm glad it

127
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:14,880
all worked out.

128
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:14,880
Thank you.

129
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:16,210
Ambo pulling up.

130
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,520
Big rig overturned

131
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,520
on the Kennedy.

132
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,790
Car got crushed.

133
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,790
We're heading to Baghdad.

134
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:20,890
How many injured?

135
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,220
One. Coded on the way.

136
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:23,320
Courtney talk to me.

137
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:25,460
John Brady, 52,

138
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:25,460
triple zero,

139
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:27,700
intubated and bilaterally

140
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:27,700
needled in the field.

141
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,360
John?

142
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,360
You know him?

143
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:30,910
Yeah, one of

144
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:30,910
my trial patients.

145
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,270
Downtime greater

146
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,270
than 15 minutes.

147
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:34,640
Fifteen? Let's move it.

148
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:39,910
John, we got you, buddy.

149
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:39,910
On my count, one, two, three.

150
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:42,340
Thank you.

151
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,190
Okay. Pause CPR.

152
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,520
PEA. Continue CPR.

153
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:54,290
Push a milligram of epi.

154
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:54,290
Come on, John.

155
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:00,330
Come on, John.

156
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:00,330
Come on.

157
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:00,330
Check pulse.

158
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,470
We have a pulse.

159
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,470
Sinus rhythm.

160
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:07,510
All right, ultrasound.

161
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:07,510
Let's fast him.

162
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:08,600
Okay.

163
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:16,340
Fast is negative.

164
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:17,440
Pressure's dropping.

165
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:19,920
Let's get him a unit

166
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:19,920
of blood and then FFP

167
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:19,920
on the rapid transfuser.

168
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,510
V-fib.

169
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,250
Damn it. Charge to 200.

170
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:26,220
Charging.

171
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:30,700
Come on.

172
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:30,700
Here we go. Clear.

173
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,660
Again.

174
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:37,530
Push another

175
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:37,530
milligram of epi.

176
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:42,970
All right. Clear.

177
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,670
Pulse.

178
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,510
Check pulse.

179
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,510
Still v-fib.

180
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,690
Come on, John.

181
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,690
Breathe for me.

182
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,950
Breathe, John. Clear.

183
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:01,930
Keep up compressions.

184
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:01,930
Charge again.

185
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,260
Clear.

186
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,270
Let's go. Keep going.

187
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,020
I mean, he was doing

188
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,020
so well in the trial.

189
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:34,300
His heart was improving.

190
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,670
Only to get killed

191
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,670
in some freak accident.

192
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:38,030
I'm so sorry, Will.

193
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:41,630
I found these

194
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:41,630
in Mr. Brady's belongings.

195
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:42,900
Trial meds?

196
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:42,900
Yeah.

197
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,470
Those have to

198
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,470
go back to Kender.

199
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:46,060
All right. I'll put it

200
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:46,060
in the outgoing box.

201
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:47,840
I gotta go pick up

202
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:47,840
my mom right now.

203
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:50,380
But if you wanna

204
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:50,380
talk later, I'm around.

205
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:51,610
Thanks, Nat.

206
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:51,610
Yeah.

207
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,550
My heart is getting worse?

208
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,320
How can that be?

209
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:05,390
I've been feeling better.

210
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:07,530
You have been having

211
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:07,530
palpitations.

212
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:09,860
Only in the last

213
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:09,860
couple of days,

214
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:12,060
and they go away

215
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:12,060
very quickly.

216
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:13,800
I'm afraid that's just

217
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:13,800
the first sign

218
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,000
that your heart's

219
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,000
getting weaker.

220
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,040
Your heart has become

221
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,040
more dependent on the LVAD.

222
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,660
Wasn't that the point of

223
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,660
getting it in the first place?

224
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:20,760
Not exactly.

225
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,610
The, uh, LVAD is just

226
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,610
meant to be a support

227
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:25,540
until cardiac

228
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:25,540
function improves,

229
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:27,450
or if that doesn't happen,

230
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:29,610
until a donor heart

231
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:29,610
becomes available.

232
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:30,950
Oh.

233
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:32,380
So, what are our options?

234
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:34,050
I'd like for you to stick

235
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:34,050
around for a few hours,

236
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,650
so we can give you

237
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,650
some IV fluids.

238
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,120
And then I can go home?

239
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,850
I also want to run

240
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,850
a few more tests.

241
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,900
Then we'll take stock

242
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,900
of where we are.

243
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,020
Okay?

244
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:52,800
Hey, I'm sorry.

245
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:54,880
I know that's not what either

246
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:54,880
of you wanted to hear.

247
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:57,610
I really hoped the LVAD

248
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:57,610
would have been

249
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:57,610
a better solution.

250
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:59,370
Yeah, I still think

251
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:59,370
it was the right call.

252
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,080
I'm not blaming you.

253
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,080
I thought it was

254
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,080
a better option, too.

255
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:04,450
But you know what?

256
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:04,450
I'm gonna go talk to Will,

257
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:06,110
see if he can still

258
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:06,110
get her into the trial.

259
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:09,050
Even if he did, your mom

260
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:09,050
could still get the placebo.

261
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,920
I know, but I need to

262
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,920
explore all of our options.

263
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:14,000
Yeah. Of course.

264
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:18,630
Hey.

265
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:19,790
How'd your mom's

266
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:19,790
appointment go?

267
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:20,890
Not great.

268
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:24,400
Um, the LVAD's not helping

269
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:24,400
as much as we'd hoped.

270
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:25,670
Sorry to hear that.

271
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:28,610
Look, I know at first,

272
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:28,610
it was either your

273
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:28,610
trial meds or the LVAD.

274
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:30,040
We couldn't do both.

275
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:30,040
Yeah.

276
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:32,080
All trial patients

277
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:32,080
have to fit

278
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:32,080
the same criteria.

279
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:34,170
Sure, but if she

280
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:34,170
was on the medication,

281
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,510
would it react adversely

282
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,510
with the LVAD?

283
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:39,650
It's a great drug,

284
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:39,650
but this is

285
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:39,650
uncharted territory.

286
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,090
If Mom understood

287
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,090
the risk,

288
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:44,920
is there any way you could

289
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:44,920
still get her into the trial?

290
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:48,460
Nat, I'm sorry,

291
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:48,460
I wish I could.

292
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:48,460
Enrollment's closed.

293
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,160
Isn't there anything

294
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,160
you can do?

295
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,690
I'll tell you what,

296
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,690
I'll ask Dr. Virani.

297
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,970
See if she can make

298
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,970
an exception.

299
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,970
But I can't promise anything.

300
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,210
I understand. Thank you.

301
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:04,770
Okay, we'll be right there.

302
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:08,980
Hey, Dean. I need you.

303
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:08,980
Yeah. What's going on?

304
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,070
CFD just called.

305
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:12,120
There's been an accident

306
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:12,120
at a house under renovation.

307
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:14,990
Two injured. One seriously,

308
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:14,990
open abdominal wound

309
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:16,520
and he's trapped

310
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:16,520
under debris.

311
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,680
Are they gonna need us

312
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,680
to do a field amputation?

313
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:19,820
Uh, I hope not.

314
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:21,790
But they said

315
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:21,790
he's trying to

316
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:21,790
get the guy free,

317
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,870
and they need us to bring

318
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,870
blood and plasma.

319
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:25,160
Let's gear up and go.

320
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:27,730
Mrs. Forbes,

321
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:27,730
I'm Dr. Marcel.

322
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,960
This is Nurse Sexton.

323
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,960
Hi.

324
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:30,500
My husband Robert.

325
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:30,500
Hi.

326
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:32,970
Excuse me. I see

327
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:32,970
you've had COVID.

328
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:32,970
Yeah.

329
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:35,700
You're experiencing

330
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:35,700
chest pain and

331
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:35,700
shortness of breath.

332
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:37,870
When she woke up

333
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:37,870
this morning,

334
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:37,870
it was pretty bad.

335
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,740
How long have you been

336
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,740
having these symptoms?

337
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:43,580
On and off since I

338
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:43,580
had COVID, but it's gotten

339
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:43,580
worse the past few days.

340
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:46,710
She's been testing

341
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:46,710
negative for weeks, but it

342
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:46,710
doesn't seem to matter.

343
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:49,520
Unfortunately,

344
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:49,520
some people experience

345
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:49,520
symptoms for weeks,

346
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,560
even months,

347
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,560
after the virus is gone.

348
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:55,060
Sats 93.

349
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:55,060
Heart rate's

350
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:55,060
elevated, too.

351
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,500
Right before COVID,

352
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,500
we just started trying

353
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,500
to get pregnant.

354
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:02,170
We waited so long

355
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:02,170
to start a family.

356
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:04,970
I'm just ready to start

357
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:04,970
getting back to our lives.

358
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:08,910
Yeah. Let's figure out

359
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:08,910
what's going on

360
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:08,910
and get you fixed up, okay?

361
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,210
I'll see you in a bit.

362
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,770
Doc?

363
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,770
Yeah?

364
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,010
You think there's

365
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,010
something wrong

366
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,010
with her heart?

367
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,880
Oh, we're just covering

368
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,880
all our bases.

369
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,210
Don't worry.

370
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,210
Okay.

371
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,910
We're gonna take

372
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,910
good care of you.

373
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,790
It's good to get out

374
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,790
in the field

375
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,790
for a change.

376
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:27,890
Yeah.

377
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:35,870
Know what this is

378
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:35,870
reminding me of?

379
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:35,870
Helmand.

380
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:38,570
Crammed inside that Humvee.

381
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:38,570
Hotter than hell.

382
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,830
I sweat just

383
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,830
thinking about it.

384
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:44,740
Jacked up on adrenaline,

385
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:44,740
not knowing what

386
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:44,740
you're gonna face.

387
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:57,050
Hey, it was

388
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:57,050
a crazy time.

389
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:57,050
Yeah, no kidding.

390
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:06,030
Got incoming.

391
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:08,140
Dr. Halstead,

392
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:08,140
you're going to Two.

393
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:08,140
Desmond?

394
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,640
Ramona Davis.

395
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,640
30-year-old female,

396
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,640
persistently vomiting.

397
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:14,570
GCS 15.

398
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:14,570
Heart rate 133.

399
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,110
BP 112/82.

400
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:17,770
Gave her half

401
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:17,770
a liter of saline

402
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:17,770
in the field.

403
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,180
All right. Let's get her

404
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,180
ready to rotate.

405
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,340
Ramona, remember me?

406
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,340
I'm Dr. Halstead.

407
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:22,950
I can't stop throwing up.

408
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:25,780
How long's that

409
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:25,780
been going on?

410
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:25,780
About an hour.

411
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:29,260
All right. On my count.

412
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:29,260
One, two, three.

413
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,860
Thank you.

414
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,860
I'm gonna be sick.

415
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,690
All right, just hold on.

416
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,790
Go ahead.

417
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,890
Okay. Okay.

418
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,890
Thank you, Kristen.

419
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:39,060
Let's check your eyes,

420
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:39,060
Ramona.

421
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,270
Pinpoint pupils.

422
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,270
All right.

423
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:47,170
Ramona, I have to ask,

424
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:47,170
did you take something

425
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:47,170
to make yourself sick?

426
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:50,970
Okay. What did you take?

427
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:54,710
Ramona. What was it?

428
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,840
Miss Davis?

429
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,840
Tell us what you took.

430
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:00,320
I want to see Dr. Charles.

431
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,160
EKG, CBC, BMP

432
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:06,130
and send her blood

433
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:06,130
for an expanded

434
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:06,130
toxicology panel.

435
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:07,220
Got it.

436
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,130
Ramona, I wanna

437
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,130
help you feel better.

438
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:10,860
But you gotta help me

439
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:10,860
and tell me what you took.

440
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:13,940
Dr. Charles. I'll only

441
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:13,940
speak to Dr. Charles.

442
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,870
Never showed up

443
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,870
for her appointment

444
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,270
with Dr. Lancaster

445
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,270
this morning.

446
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:25,370
And after our encounter,

447
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:25,370
she must've gone home,

448
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,840
taken something

449
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,840
to make herself sick.

450
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:28,350
And Anna

451
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:28,350
was with you, right?

452
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:30,940
That makes me

453
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:30,940
a little nervous, Daniel.

454
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:32,210
How do you want

455
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:32,210
to handle this?

456
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,020
Look, I can't say

457
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,020
I didn't see it coming.

458
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,020
All right?

459
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,420
Last time she was here,

460
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,690
in order to treat her,

461
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,690
I had to get her to

462
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,690
trust me, which I did.

463
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:42,090
But in the process,

464
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:42,090
I became the new

465
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:42,090
Dr. Bridges.

466
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,430
Right, so, look.

467
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,430
I don't like it either,

468
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:46,290
but it seems like

469
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:46,290
I should talk to her.

470
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,240
Are you sure?

471
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,240
This patient harms herself

472
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,240
to get attention.

473
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,770
Aren't you just

474
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,770
rewarding that

475
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:52,200
by giving her

476
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:52,200
what she wants?

477
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:53,740
But if not me, who?

478
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,740
It certainly doesn't

479
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,740
seem like she's gonna

480
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,310
engage with somebody

481
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,310
she doesn't trust.

482
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,050
Sooner or later,

483
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,050
she's gonna run

484
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,050
out of luck, right?

485
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:02,310
And one of these

486
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:02,310
attention-getting schemes

487
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:02,310
is gonna kill her.

488
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:03,810
I don't know.

489
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,250
It just seems

490
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,250
a little irresponsible

491
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,790
to keep kicking

492
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,790
the can down the road.

493
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:08,820
Look, I understand

494
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:08,820
your concern,

495
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,920
but in this instance,

496
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,920
I'd rather wait

497
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,920
for the tox screen.

498
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:15,990
Hopefully, that will

499
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:15,990
give us the answer we need

500
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:15,990
without your intervention.

501
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,900
This will help you,

502
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,900
Miss Davis.

503
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,800
Miss Davis? Don't worry.

504
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,800
We'll take care of you.

505
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:29,410
Hey, Brett.

506
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:29,410
Hey, glad you guys

507
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:29,410
are here.

508
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:31,780
This is

509
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:31,780
Dr. Dean Archer. Surgeon.

510
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:31,780
How badly is he hurt?

511
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,080
Uh, head trauma,

512
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,080
broken arm.

513
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:37,120
The victim trapped

514
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:37,120
in the basement

515
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:37,120
is in much worse shape.

516
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:38,210
Thanks.

517
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:40,820
Joe, got here

518
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:40,820
as quick as we could.

519
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:40,820
What happened?

520
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:44,380
They're renovating the house.

521
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:44,380
Guy cut a truss to install

522
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:44,380
some ductwork.

523
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:47,980
Cut a little too deep.

524
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:47,980
Whole floor caved in

525
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:47,980
on top of him.

526
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:50,120
Circular saw

527
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:50,120
cut him as he fell.

528
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:51,790
How long until

529
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:51,790
you can get him free?

530
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:55,770
My team is working as

531
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:55,770
fast as they can, but there's

532
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:55,770
a lot of unstable weight.

533
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:57,300
This way.

534
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:59,900
We're trying to secure

535
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:59,900
the floor with struts

536
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:59,900
and cribbing

537
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:01,840
to avoid

538
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:01,840
a secondary collapse.

539
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:03,500
It's just down here.

540
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:12,840
Oh, thank God.

541
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:12,840
Eddie, it's gonna be okay.

542
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:15,750
Mrs. Howard, please,

543
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:15,750
it's safer for you outside.

544
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:18,830
No, please,

545
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:18,830
I want her here.

546
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:18,830
Let her stay.

547
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:20,160
Watch your step.

548
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:20,160
Thanks.

549
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,530
Okay, we need to

550
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,530
give the doctors some room.

551
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,530
Let's wait over here.

552
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,160
Hey, Violet,

553
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,160
talk to me.

554
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:29,000
Eddie Howard,

555
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:29,000
34 years old. BP 110/70.

556
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,400
Large abdominal wound

557
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,400
with evisceration

558
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,400
from circular saw.

559
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:32,500
Meds?

560
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:33,830
Ten milligrams

561
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:33,830
of morphine IV.

562
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:34,930
All right, thanks.

563
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,100
We'll take it from here.

564
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,100
Yeah.

565
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:38,940
Hey. Eddie, I'm Dr. Choi,

566
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:38,940
this is Dr. Dean Archer.

567
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:40,210
We're gonna take care

568
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:40,210
of you, all right?

569
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,510
My wife told me

570
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,510
to hire an HVAC

571
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,510
contractor,

572
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,840
but I thought

573
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,840
me and my buddy could

574
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,840
do the work ourselves.

575
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:46,410
Let's hang some blood.

576
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:49,080
We'll wrap his intestines

577
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:49,080
with some saline

578
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:49,080
to keep them moist.

579
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:50,520
You're not gonna

580
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:50,520
put 'em back in me?

581
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,420
No. We're gonna

582
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,420
protect them for now.

583
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:55,460
We'll put them back

584
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:55,460
where they belong when

585
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:55,460
we get you to the hospital.

586
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,490
Hang in there, Eddie,

587
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,490
we're going to get you

588
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,490
out of here soon.

589
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:01,460
Okay. Good news.

590
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:04,460
Your EKG shows no sign

591
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:04,460
of any irregularity.

592
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:06,400
Then why does it feel

593
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:06,400
like my heart

594
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:08,410
is gonna pound

595
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:08,410
out of my chest?

596
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:10,410
Let's take another listen.

597
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:16,180
Definitely bounding.

598
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:16,180
Take a deep breath for me.

599
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:19,820
Yeah.

600
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:19,820
Honey, hey.

601
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:25,230
This should help you

602
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:25,230
breathe a little easier,

603
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:25,230
okay?

604
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:26,590
What's happening to her?

605
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:29,420
It's possible that

606
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:29,420
she's developed

607
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:29,420
a pulmonary embolism.

608
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:31,930
It's a blood clot

609
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:31,930
in the lungs.

610
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:35,060
We've seen it in patients

611
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:35,060
who've recovered from COVID.

612
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:35,060
It's treatable.

613
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:38,230
I'm gonna send you

614
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:38,230
for a chest CT,

615
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:38,230
then we'll know for sure.

616
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:40,330
April, if we can start her

617
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:40,330
on a heparin drip

618
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,380
and then send her

619
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,380
for a CT, PE study.

620
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,380
Sure thing.

621
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,520
Sats are dropping!

622
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:52,880
Okay.

623
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:56,210
Ramona, I'm gonna listen

624
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:56,210
to your lungs, okay?

625
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:00,020
Slow and deep breaths.

626
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:00,020
She's tight.

627
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:02,890
125 Solu-Medrol,

628
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:02,890
breathing treatment, stat.

629
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:08,370
Okay, that's it.

630
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:08,370
Breathe deep.

631
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,500
All right, Ramona,

632
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,500
this has gone on

633
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,500
long enough.

634
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:12,600
You need to tell us

635
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:12,600
what you took.

636
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:18,880
Ramona, whatever

637
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:18,880
you ingested is working

638
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:18,880
its way through your system.

639
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:21,970
If we don't treat it properly,

640
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:21,970
you can have some

641
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:21,970
serious complication.

642
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,070
You may even die.

643
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,210
Tell us,

644
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,210
so we can help you.

645
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:28,220
I want Dr. Charles!

646
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,430
He's clear.

647
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,430
Oh, thank God.

648
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:39,520
Let's slide him out.

649
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:41,360
I'm here, honey.

650
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:41,360
You're gonna be okay.

651
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,130
All right.

652
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,130
Someone grab the backboard.

653
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,210
Let's roll him.

654
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,210
Ready?

655
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,210
Yeah.

656
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:52,410
Roll.

657
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:52,410
Back right,

658
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:52,410
he's on it.

659
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:54,280
Let's get that

660
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:54,280
stokes basket in here.

661
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:56,610
All right, careful with that.

662
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:56,610
Let's get this guy

663
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:56,610
to the hospital.

664
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:01,980
Let's transfer him

665
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:01,980
on my count. Ready?

666
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:01,980
Watch his arm.

667
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:04,990
Yeah.

668
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:04,990
Everybody ready?

669
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:04,990
One, two, three.

670
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,920
Get down!

671
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:10,090
What the hell?

672
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:18,570
Just got word from PD.

673
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:20,970
Gang fight broke out.

674
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:20,970
Neighborhood's on lockdown.

675
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,240
No ambulances in or out.

676
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:24,010
This man can't wait, Joe.

677
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,940
If we don't get him

678
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,940
to the hospital soon,

679
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,940
he'll die.

680
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:29,280
It's not my call.

681
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:29,280
I'll let you know

682
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:29,280
if I hear anything else.

683
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:30,510
All right.

684
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:37,020
Hey, Dean. You okay?

685
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:37,020
Huh?

686
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,590
You okay?

687
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,590
Yeah. Fine, fine, fine.

688
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:40,460
What's happening?

689
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:40,460
Courtney.

690
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:43,150
Come on, Michelle,

691
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:43,150
let's get you some water.

692
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,660
Eddie?

693
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,660
Eddie, stay with us.

694
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:46,130
BP's tanking.

695
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:47,570
He's not protecting

696
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:47,570
his airway.

697
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:48,660
I'll bag him.

698
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,570
Hang another

699
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,570
unit of blood.

700
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:53,500
This is the last one.

701
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:57,610
Oh, God. More laps.

702
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:57,610
More laps!

703
00:16:57,710 --> 00:16:59,410
Where's all this

704
00:16:57,710 --> 00:16:59,410
blood coming from?

705
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:03,140
It's coming from the liver.

706
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:03,140
Laceration on the right lobe.

707
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:05,680
Can you repair it?

708
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,550
Maybe a Pringle.

709
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:11,490
Clamp the inflow

710
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:11,490
of blood to the liver.

711
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:16,050
But it's dark,

712
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:16,050
non-sterile environment.

713
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,720
Hey, this guy is bleeding out

714
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,720
right in front of us.

715
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:19,020
We have to.

716
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:20,330
Yeah. Uh...

717
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,000
Dean.

718
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,000
Yeah.

719
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:27,700
Get me a clamp,

720
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:27,700
gauze, anything,

721
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:27,700
to soak up the blood.

722
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:29,400
See what the hell

723
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:29,400
I'm doing.

724
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:29,400
Okay.

725
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:32,240
Your CT was normal.

726
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:32,240
No PE.

727
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:34,650
Then why is my wife

728
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:34,650
having trouble breathing?

729
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,620
So far, we haven't

730
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,620
been able to find

731
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,650
any physical explanation

732
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,650
for your symptoms.

733
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:42,710
Mr. and Mrs. Forbes,

734
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:42,710
I spent a long time

735
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:42,710
in the COVID ward.

736
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:45,490
I saw patients

737
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:45,490
on ventilators for weeks.

738
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:49,290
A lot of them suffered

739
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:49,290
emotional trauma

740
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:49,290
from their time in the ICU.

741
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:53,490
Wait. You think

742
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:53,490
this is in my head?

743
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,370
Considering the stress

744
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,370
you've been under

745
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,370
for the past few months,

746
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:59,370
it would be understandable

747
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:59,370
if this was anxiety based.

748
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:00,770
She's not imagining this!

749
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,340
No, no one is saying

750
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,340
she is.

751
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,500
Look. Anxiety, if that's

752
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,500
what's behind this,

753
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:06,240
can cause

754
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:06,240
very real symptoms.

755
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:08,110
You can't do anything

756
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:08,110
to help my wife?

757
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:11,280
We'll continue to

758
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:11,280
monitor her symptoms,

759
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:11,280
run tests, but...

760
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:13,550
But what?

761
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:13,550
If all else fails,

762
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:16,520
it can't hurt to speak

763
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:16,520
with one of our

764
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:16,520
in-house psychiatrists.

765
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:23,050
You paged me?

766
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,600
Dr. Halstead?

767
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,600
Ramona's going

768
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,600
downhill fast.

769
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,790
What about

770
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,790
the tox screen?

771
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,540
Whatever she took

772
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,540
didn't show up.

773
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:31,100
Daniel?

774
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:36,240
Looks like

775
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:36,240
we're out of options.

776
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:36,240
So, um, wish me luck.

777
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,080
Thanks.

778
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,080
Mmm-hmm.

779
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:44,480
Ramona.

780
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:44,480
You came.

781
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,420
Look, you're

782
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,420
running out of time.

783
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,790
You gotta tell us

784
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,790
what you took,

785
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,790
so we can help you.

786
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:51,220
If you agree

787
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:51,220
to be my doctor.

788
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:52,550
I already

789
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:52,550
am your doctor.

790
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:54,220
I never stopped

791
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:54,220
being your doctor.

792
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,320
You know what I mean.

793
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:58,300
I'm an emergency

794
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:58,300
room psychiatrist.

795
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,490
All right?

796
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,490
We talked about this.

797
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,590
I'm simply not available

798
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,590
to give you the kind

799
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,590
of care you need.

800
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:05,670
Dr. Lancaster,

801
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:05,670
though, he is...

802
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:05,670
But I want you.

803
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:12,550
Just like

804
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:12,550
you wanted Dr. Bridges?

805
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:15,470
Look, here you are,

806
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:15,470
back in the hospital.

807
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:18,250
You're different

808
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:18,250
from Dr. Bridges.

809
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:24,320
You listen to me.

810
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:24,320
You hear me.

811
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:31,470
That's all I need.

812
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:31,470
Someone to hear me. Please.

813
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:36,400
I'll make you a deal.

814
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:36,400
All right? You tell me

815
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:36,400
what you took,

816
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,800
and I will come back

817
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,800
and we can talk

818
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,800
about this a bit.

819
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:57,350
Insecticide. Malathion.

820
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:57,350
Oh, my God.

821
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:59,720
Give her a DuoDote

822
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:59,720
of atropine

823
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:59,720
and pralidoxime.

824
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:01,560
You got it.

825
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:03,720
Yeah. Shouldn't take long

826
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:03,720
to see improvement.

827
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:05,770
Give me a shout when

828
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:05,770
she's out of the woods.

829
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:06,890
Yeah.

830
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,530
Help!

831
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,910
We need help.

832
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,910
She can't breathe.

833
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:20,680
It hurts.

834
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:20,680
Easy, easy.

835
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:22,220
Oh, God.

836
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:25,550
Does this look like

837
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:25,550
anxiety to you?

838
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:27,880
All right.

839
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:27,880
Sedate her and set up

840
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:27,880
for a bronchoscopy.

841
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:29,550
We need to scope her.

842
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:31,890
It's okay, it's okay.

843
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:33,460
We'll take a closer look

844
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:33,460
at your lungs, okay?

845
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,890
Come on. Do something.

846
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,890
Do something!

847
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,290
Nice and easy, okay?

848
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,290
We're taking care of it.

849
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:41,300
All right.

850
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,670
What's happening?

851
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:48,340
There you go.

852
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:48,340
It's okay.

853
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:54,280
Brought you

854
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:54,280
an afternoon pick-me-up.

855
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:56,320
Always so thoughtful.

856
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:02,450
Listen, um,

857
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:02,450
Dr. Manning's mother

858
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:02,450
is in heart failure.

859
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,790
I know

860
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,790
enrollment's closed,

861
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:07,330
but is there any way

862
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:07,330
we can get her

863
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:07,330
into the trial?

864
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:08,490
I'm sorry, Will.

865
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,530
Letting her in now

866
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,530
would compromise

867
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,530
the data

868
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:13,360
we've already collected.

869
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:13,360
I get it.

870
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:16,560
It's just

871
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:16,560
Carol is an old friend.

872
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:20,000
And she's getting worse.

873
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:20,000
Our drug could save

874
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:20,000
her life.

875
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:22,740
There's no guarantee

876
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:22,740
that she would get

877
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:22,740
the actual drug.

878
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:26,610
And even if she did,

879
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:26,610
we don't know how

880
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:26,610
effective it would be.

881
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:28,640
The drug works.

882
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:31,740
The preliminary data

883
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:31,740
has been encouraging, but...

884
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:35,280
No, it works. I know it does.

885
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:38,680
It's a blind trial.

886
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:38,680
How could you?

887
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:41,950
Will?

888
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,370
I unblinded a patient.

889
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,590
What?

890
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:49,960
A couple months back.

891
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:53,340
You did this

892
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:53,340
behind my back?

893
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:56,580
I didn't want to.

894
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:56,580
But I had to.

895
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,810
For the sake

896
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,810
of my patient.

897
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,480
Do you have any idea

898
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,480
what you've done?

899
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:07,450
You've jeopardized

900
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:07,450
the whole trial. Not to

901
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:07,450
mention both of our jobs.

902
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:12,590
Look, Sabeena,

903
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:12,590
I've told you this

904
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:12,590
in confidence.

905
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:14,690
We're having drinks

906
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:14,690
with Mark Barragan tonight.

907
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:19,390
How am I supposed to sing

908
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:19,390
your praises, knowing you've

909
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:19,390
broken the most basic rule?

910
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,790
I'm sorry.

911
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,790
Really, I am.

912
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:30,670
I have no idea

913
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:30,670
what I'm gonna do.

914
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:34,310
But I can tell you this.

915
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:37,780
I'm not making

916
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:37,780
any exceptions

917
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:37,780
to the enrollment.

918
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:42,510
Okay.

919
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,530
Hey, Nat.

920
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,530
Yeah.

921
00:22:58,010 --> 00:22:59,530
So, I talked

922
00:22:58,010 --> 00:22:59,530
to Dr. Virani,

923
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,770
and there's just

924
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,770
no way to get your mom

925
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,770
into the trial.

926
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,870
I'm sorry.

927
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:06,970
What if I talk to her?

928
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:06,970
Explain how serious

929
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:06,970
Mom's condition is?

930
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,610
Trust me. She's not

931
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,610
gonna change her mind.

932
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:11,780
Okay. Um,

933
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:11,780
thank you for trying.

934
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:15,050
Yeah, hey, I really wish

935
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:15,050
there was something more

936
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:15,050
I could do.

937
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:19,460
I guess we'll just

938
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:19,460
stay on course

939
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:19,460
with Dr. Young. Thanks.

940
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:23,390
How are you feeling?

941
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:26,930
Good, now that

942
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:26,930
you're here.

943
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:32,600
I like your tie.

944
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:34,540
My father

945
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:34,540
wore a tie every day.

946
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:37,770
He had very

947
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:37,770
fine taste in clothes.

948
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:40,370
You know,

949
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:40,370
speaking of your dad,

950
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,920
last time you were here,

951
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,920
I was struck by...

952
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:46,010
You said that

953
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:46,010
you didn't think

954
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:46,010
he cared about you.

955
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:49,050
Those were your words.

956
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:49,050
Not mine.

957
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:52,120
Oh.

958
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:52,120
We were very close.

959
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:53,420
Oh.

960
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:55,150
Tell me a little more

961
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:55,150
about him.

962
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,530
There isn't any more.

963
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:01,530
How about your mom.

964
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:01,530
Was she around?

965
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,630
She left us.

966
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:07,470
Sorry to hear that.

967
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:07,470
How old were you?

968
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:11,970
I don't know...

969
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:11,970
Um... five or six.

970
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,840
Anyway, it didn't matter.

971
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:16,410
How's that?

972
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:22,050
My father said

973
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:22,050
we didn't need her.

974
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:22,050
We were a team.

975
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,090
No brothers or sisters?

976
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:26,850
Just me.

977
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,930
Some kids

978
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,930
in that position, they...

979
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:31,690
I don't know, sometimes

980
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:31,690
would wish that they

981
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,600
had a little brother or sister

982
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,600
to play with. But not you?

983
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:36,690
I didn't.

984
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,970
I was very happy.

985
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:43,880
I mean, I guess

986
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:43,880
you didn't have to

987
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:43,880
share him with anybody.

988
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:52,110
What you thinking about?

989
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:56,080
Ramona?

990
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:03,460
You know, um,

991
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:03,460
I could use a snack.

992
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:03,460
How about you? You hungry?

993
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,470
A sandwich? Jell-O?

994
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08,860
Jell-O...

995
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08,860
I like orange.

996
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:10,900
Me, too.

997
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:10,900
I'll be back.

998
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,910
All right.

999
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:26,220
Come on.

1000
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:28,220
74/60.

1001
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:30,090
I can't find the artery.

1002
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:35,520
I can't find it.

1003
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:35,520
Can't find it.

1004
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:37,600
Dean.

1005
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:37,600
Dean, what's going on?

1006
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:37,600
Talk to me.

1007
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:39,660
Hey, hey. Dean, Dean.

1008
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:42,100
I know what

1009
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:42,100
you're going through, okay?

1010
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:42,100
I've been there.

1011
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,500
I've been there with you.

1012
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,500
In Helmand. All right?

1013
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:46,070
Yeah.

1014
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:46,070
Hey? We got through that

1015
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:47,270
and we're gonna

1016
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:47,270
get through this.

1017
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:47,270
No.

1018
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:48,600
Yeah.

1019
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:48,600
No, no.

1020
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:50,540
You can do this.

1021
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:50,540
I can't do it.

1022
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,240
Yes, you can.

1023
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:56,050
You're the finest surgeon

1024
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:56,050
I know.

1025
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:57,810
Hey, hey. Look at me.

1026
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:57,810
Look at me.

1027
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,010
Deep breaths.

1028
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:00,780
Deep breaths.

1029
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:03,810
Yeah.

1030
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:06,890
There you go.

1031
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:06,890
Okay, I need you.

1032
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:09,020
This patient needs you.

1033
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:09,020
Okay.

1034
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:10,220
Okay?

1035
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:10,220
Okay.

1036
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:12,090
You got this, Dean.

1037
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:12,090
All right.

1038
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:17,670
PD's got the situation

1039
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:17,670
under control.

1040
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:17,670
It's safe to leave.

1041
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:18,900
Hold on, hold on. Dean?

1042
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,240
Found it. Clamped.

1043
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:31,780
Bleeding's stopped.

1044
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:31,780
Pressure's coming back up.

1045
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:33,820
Good job. Good job.

1046
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,050
Let's go.

1047
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,050
Yeah.

1048
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,890
Bring them in.

1049
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,890
Copy that.

1050
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:38,150
Okay, need a hand.

1051
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:42,990
Mrs. Forbes,

1052
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:42,990
you doing okay?

1053
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:46,630
Almost there.

1054
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:50,600
Okay, I'm seeing

1055
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:50,600
several small lesions

1056
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:54,070
in the distal airway

1057
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:54,070
of your lower left lobe.

1058
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:56,840
What does that mean?

1059
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:56,840
Tumors?

1060
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:01,010
I'm not sure.

1061
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:01,010
Can I get a sample

1062
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:01,010
for biopsy?

1063
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,950
Come up a little bit more.

1064
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,950
Right there.

1065
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:08,910
I know it's hard,

1066
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:08,910
try not to worry.

1067
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:10,620
We'll know soon

1068
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:10,620
what we're dealing with.

1069
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:12,890
Okay, stop. Open.

1070
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:15,920
Carol?

1071
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:15,920
Mmm.

1072
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:19,660
I'm sorry to say that

1073
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:19,660
even with the fluids and

1074
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:19,660
adjustments to the LVAD,

1075
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:21,060
your heart's still

1076
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:21,060
having arrhythmias.

1077
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:24,930
So, what do we do now?

1078
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:24,930
I'd like to add an AICD.

1079
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,340
And what is that?

1080
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,340
It's a device

1081
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,340
that's implanted

1082
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,340
in your chest

1083
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,910
that can help

1084
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,910
regulate your heart.

1085
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:31,740
If an arrhythmia

1086
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:31,740
develops,

1087
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:34,640
it can shock your heart back

1088
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:34,640
into a normal sinus rhythm.

1089
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,080
Does it hurt

1090
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,080
to get shocked?

1091
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:39,680
My patients do say

1092
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:39,680
it causes discomfort.

1093
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:43,120
One patient describes it

1094
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:43,120
as feeling like getting kicked

1095
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:43,120
in the chest.

1096
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:45,920
Who can say no to that?

1097
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:49,160
Mom, I think

1098
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:49,160
you should just

1099
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:49,160
hear Dr. Young out.

1100
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:53,060
It's a minimally invasive

1101
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:53,060
procedure and it will help

1102
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:53,060
the LVAD work better.

1103
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:57,200
So, in addition

1104
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:57,200
to lugging

1105
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:57,200
my LVAD around,

1106
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:00,210
I get the added benefit

1107
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:00,210
of getting kicked

1108
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:00,210
in the chest?

1109
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,840
I do think you should

1110
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,840
consider the AICD.

1111
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:07,740
I'm sorry, what kind

1112
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:07,740
of quality of life is that?

1113
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:12,720
It's not ideal, but it

1114
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:12,720
will keep you alive until

1115
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:12,720
you can have a transplant.

1116
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:19,120
Um... Good. I'm tired.

1117
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:19,120
Would you take me

1118
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:19,120
home, please?

1119
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:20,220
Thank you, Doctor.

1120
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:20,220
Okay.

1121
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:27,260
Endometriosis?

1122
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:27,260
My sister had that

1123
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:27,260
in her uterus.

1124
00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:29,700
Yeah. That's usually

1125
00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:29,700
where it occurs,

1126
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,300
but in very rare cases,

1127
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,300
the endometrial cells

1128
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:35,670
can migrate

1129
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:35,670
to other parts of the body,

1130
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:35,670
like the lungs.

1131
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:38,770
And once there,

1132
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:38,770
they respond to

1133
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:38,770
hormone fluctuations

1134
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,710
from your menstrual cycle

1135
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,710
and can grow,

1136
00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:42,720
causing bleeding,

1137
00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:42,720
and even a collapsed lung.

1138
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:46,080
How do we treat it?

1139
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:48,710
Since it's fed

1140
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:48,710
by hormones,

1141
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:51,220
I would recommend

1142
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:51,220
inducing early menopause,

1143
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:56,460
either by removing

1144
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:56,460
the ovaries or through

1145
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:56,460
a series of injections.

1146
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:00,460
You can't put me

1147
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:00,460
into menopause.

1148
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:00,460
We want to have a baby.

1149
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,760
Honey, we gotta do

1150
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,760
whatever it takes

1151
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,760
to make you better.

1152
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:10,400
We've dreamt of having

1153
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:10,400
a family for so long.

1154
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:10,400
I am not giving up on this.

1155
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:14,880
Dr. Marcel?

1156
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:14,880
Yeah.

1157
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:21,890
Okay.

1158
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:21,890
There is another option.

1159
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:26,160
I can perform a surgery,

1160
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:26,160
a lobectomy,

1161
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:30,020
whereby I remove

1162
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:30,020
the portion of the lung

1163
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:30,020
with endometriosis.

1164
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:31,930
Now, it's only

1165
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:31,930
a temporary measure.

1166
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:34,990
There's a strong chance

1167
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:34,990
it could come back,

1168
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,800
requiring additional

1169
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,800
surgery,

1170
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:39,130
and potentially putting

1171
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:39,130
your lungs at risk.

1172
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:43,340
Okay.

1173
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:48,380
Okay. If it means that

1174
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:48,380
I can still have a baby,

1175
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:48,380
then it's worth it.

1176
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:56,860
Robert? I need you

1177
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:56,860
to be okay with this.

1178
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,960
If this is what

1179
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,960
you want...

1180
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:02,760
I am.

1181
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:09,900
Okay. I'll have

1182
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:09,900
one of the residents

1183
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:09,900
come get you pre-op'd.

1184
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:15,870
I love you.

1185
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:21,250
So, you were saying that

1186
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:21,250
you and your dad

1187
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:21,250
were a team.

1188
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:23,310
Did I get that wrong?

1189
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:24,820
You keep asking

1190
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:24,820
about my father

1191
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:27,080
and I keep telling you

1192
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:27,080
I don't wanna

1193
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:27,080
talk about him.

1194
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:30,120
But why is that?

1195
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:30,120
Did something bad happen?

1196
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:35,360
No, no. My father loved me.

1197
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:35,360
I mean, he was always there.

1198
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:40,260
We did

1199
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:40,260
lots of things together

1200
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:40,260
when I was little.

1201
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:42,930
Not so much

1202
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:42,930
when you got older?

1203
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:47,560
It was different.

1204
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,940
Huh. How? How?

1205
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:53,140
My father didn't

1206
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:53,140
like me as much.

1207
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:56,580
Really. Why do you think

1208
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:56,580
that was?

1209
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:01,580
I couldn't

1210
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:01,580
please him anymore.

1211
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:05,150
I wasn't good enough.

1212
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:08,520
Not good enough

1213
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:08,520
how, though?

1214
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:13,060
He couldn't

1215
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:13,060
stand to be around me.

1216
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:14,920
Yeah?

1217
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:17,830
I did

1218
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:17,830
everything wrong.

1219
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:24,970
I'm sorry.

1220
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:24,970
It's really no big deal.

1221
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:28,980
Dr. Charles, I'm sorry,

1222
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:28,980
but your daughter

1223
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:28,980
needs you.

1224
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:31,310
I'm busy. I'll be

1225
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:31,310
a little while, thanks.

1226
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:33,010
Okay, she said

1227
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:33,010
it's an emergency.

1228
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:34,980
What's the issue?

1229
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:36,490
I don't know.

1230
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:36,490
She didn't tell me.

1231
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:39,280
It's okay, Dr. Charles.

1232
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:39,280
No.

1233
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:41,330
I understand.

1234
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:41,330
She's your daughter.

1235
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:41,330
No.

1236
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:43,230
Let's stick

1237
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:43,230
with this, okay?

1238
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:47,070
No, really.

1239
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:47,070
I could use a moment.

1240
00:31:48,370 --> 00:31:50,170
Please, go ahead.

1241
00:31:52,170 --> 00:31:55,110
All right.

1242
00:31:52,170 --> 00:31:55,110
I'll be right back, okay?

1243
00:31:52,170 --> 00:31:55,110
Right back.

1244
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:09,890
Unbelievable.

1245
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:09,890
Okay. I'm sorry.

1246
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:13,120
The guest network

1247
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:13,120
is too busy and I can't

1248
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:13,120
stream this lecture.

1249
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:14,660
And I'm not gonna

1250
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:14,660
be able to get my

1251
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:14,660
assignment done in time.

1252
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,660
Honey, anybody

1253
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,660
on the nursing staff

1254
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,060
could've given you

1255
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,060
the Wi-Fi password.

1256
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,060
All right?

1257
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:20,530
I'm trying to help

1258
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:20,530
somebody over here.

1259
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:34,610
Where's Ramona?

1260
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:34,610
I don't know.

1261
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:36,310
There was

1262
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:36,310
a combative patient

1263
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:36,310
in Treatment Four,

1264
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:37,510
I had to help.

1265
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:37,510
I wasn't gone that long.

1266
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:40,250
Okay. Check the front.

1267
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:40,250
Tell security.

1268
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:41,480
Yeah.

1269
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:53,170
Picking up

1270
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:53,170
a package for Kender.

1271
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:54,600
Package for Kender?

1272
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:56,670
Um, I'm sorry.

1273
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:56,670
Someone already

1274
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:56,670
picked that up.

1275
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:58,700
Okay. Thanks.

1276
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:58,700
Mmm-hmm.

1277
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:12,980
Wow.

1278
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:15,490
Peanut butter whiskey.

1279
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:15,490
Who'd have thought?

1280
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:17,580
I'm not gonna lie,

1281
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:17,580
I didn't think I'd like it.

1282
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:19,720
But that's really good.

1283
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:19,720
It's delicious.

1284
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,320
You know, Will,

1285
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,320
I have to tell you,

1286
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:27,700
I am absolutely thrilled

1287
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:27,700
with your work on the trial.

1288
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,490
I can't believe

1289
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,490
this is your first

1290
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,490
experience as a PI.

1291
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:33,010
Hey, it certainly helps

1292
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:33,010
working alongside Dr. Virani.

1293
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,470
She's a great advisor,

1294
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,470
and really got me

1295
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,470
up to speed.

1296
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:38,140
One of our best.

1297
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:40,410
Your trials always

1298
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:40,410
run so smoothly.

1299
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:41,710
You care to divulge

1300
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:41,710
your secret?

1301
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:45,410
Strict adherence

1302
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:45,410
to protocols.

1303
00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:50,150
I think Dr. Virani's

1304
00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:50,150
being modest.

1305
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:53,060
She also prioritizes

1306
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:53,060
patient care.

1307
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:55,390
I mean, that's why

1308
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:55,390
we're all here, right?

1309
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,590
To save lives.

1310
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:00,730
Yes. Indeed.

1311
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:06,330
Will, Sabeena and I

1312
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:06,330
have talked about you

1313
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:09,140
taking on a bigger role

1314
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:09,140
within the company.

1315
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:11,610
Multiple trials.

1316
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:14,650
That is something

1317
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:14,650
that we've discussed

1318
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:14,650
in the past.

1319
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:19,120
But?

1320
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:25,220
Dr. Halstead has told me

1321
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:25,220
that he considers himself

1322
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:25,220
an ED doctor first,

1323
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:27,060
and a PI second.

1324
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:29,160
Well...

1325
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:29,160
Let me be blunt.

1326
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,700
Would you be willing

1327
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,700
to leave the ED

1328
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,360
and make clinical trials

1329
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,360
your full-time gig?

1330
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:44,170
I think that's something

1331
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:44,170
I would seriously consider.

1332
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:51,410
I'm sorry.

1333
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:51,410
I have to take this.

1334
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:51,410
Sure.

1335
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:10,070
How's he doing?

1336
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:10,070
I'm hopeful

1337
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:10,070
he'll make a full recovery.

1338
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,610
So, Dean...

1339
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,610
I gotta get out

1340
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,610
of these scrubs, okay?

1341
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:15,540
We need to talk about

1342
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:15,540
what happened today.

1343
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:17,080
There's nothing

1344
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:17,080
to talk about.

1345
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:17,080
Dean...

1346
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:21,210
I'm fine.

1347
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:21,210
No, you're not.

1348
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:21,210
Hey, listen.

1349
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:24,080
I think you're

1350
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:24,080
suffering from PTSD.

1351
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:26,210
I just got a little rattled.

1352
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,340
It's not every day

1353
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,340
you find yourself

1354
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:30,080
in the center of a gun battle

1355
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:30,080
with some guy's guts

1356
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:30,080
on the floor.

1357
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:33,550
We've been through

1358
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:33,550
worse in Afghanistan.

1359
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:33,550
Come on.

1360
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:35,250
Hey.

1361
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:35,250
Yeah.

1362
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,460
The things

1363
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,460
we saw over there...

1364
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:40,360
I'm still rattled by them.

1365
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:43,300
But Dr. Charles helped me.

1366
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:43,300
And he can help you, too.

1367
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,370
Therapy? Come on.

1368
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:48,700
If you broke your leg,

1369
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:48,700
you'd treat it, right?

1370
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:50,210
Mental health

1371
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:50,210
is no different.

1372
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:51,710
There shouldn't be

1373
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:51,710
a stigma attached to it.

1374
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:51,710
Listen.

1375
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:56,310
It's not about that at all.

1376
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:56,310
I don't need therapy.

1377
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:58,440
PTSD just doesn't

1378
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:58,440
go away, Dean.

1379
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:02,220
And therapy

1380
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:02,220
gives you the tools

1381
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:02,220
to deal with it.

1382
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,850
That's what a good

1383
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,850
single malt is for.

1384
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:09,190
I'm serious. Hey.

1385
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:09,190
You need to get help.

1386
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,430
Look, you were

1387
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,430
the commanding officer,

1388
00:36:12,530 --> 00:36:14,520
always putting

1389
00:36:12,530 --> 00:36:14,520
the needs of others first.

1390
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:17,390
It's time to take care

1391
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:17,390
of yourself.

1392
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:21,700
Please.

1393
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:21,700
Listen to your old friend.

1394
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:25,610
Text Dr. Charles,

1395
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:25,610
set up a time to talk.

1396
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:28,880
You're not leaving me

1397
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:28,880
much choice, are you?

1398
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:31,680
No, I'm not.

1399
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:39,790
All right.

1400
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:39,790
I'll do it right now.

1401
00:36:45,830 --> 00:36:47,270
Good.

1402
00:36:45,830 --> 00:36:47,270
Yeah.

1403
00:36:58,450 --> 00:36:59,880
Curly.

1404
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:04,480
Hey.

1405
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:06,850
Hey. I heard Mrs. Forbes'

1406
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:06,850
surgery went well.

1407
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:09,320
Yeah, I managed

1408
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:09,320
to resect the area

1409
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:09,320
with the lesion,

1410
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:10,860
and thankfully,

1411
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:10,860
avoided a lobectomy.

1412
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,690
So she's resting

1413
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,690
comfortably now.

1414
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:14,490
Wonderful.

1415
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:14,490
Yeah.

1416
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:16,530
You okay?

1417
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:16,530
Yeah, I just...

1418
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:18,860
I thought her symptoms

1419
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:18,860
were caused by anxiety.

1420
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:21,230
Hey, look.

1421
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:21,230
You made a diagnosis,

1422
00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:23,500
a very plausible one,

1423
00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:23,500
based on your experience.

1424
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:26,240
That's what medicine's

1425
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:26,240
all about, right?

1426
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:27,860
Building on what

1427
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:27,860
you already know.

1428
00:37:27,970 --> 00:37:30,880
And a lot of docs,

1429
00:37:27,970 --> 00:37:30,880
they get their MDs,

1430
00:37:27,970 --> 00:37:30,880
that's it.

1431
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:32,210
They know it all.

1432
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:36,880
You're not like that.

1433
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:36,880
You keep going for it.

1434
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:38,350
That's how

1435
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:38,350
you make a difference.

1436
00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:40,780
Thanks, Crockett.

1437
00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:40,780
Yeah, I'll see you, okay?

1438
00:38:01,310 --> 00:38:03,470
You ready to get out

1439
00:38:01,310 --> 00:38:03,470
of here, sweetie?

1440
00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:09,310
Um, that lady

1441
00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:09,310
who ran away earlier,

1442
00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:09,310
did you ever find her?

1443
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:10,780
Not yet.

1444
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:13,840
Is she dangerous?

1445
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:17,960
I think only

1446
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:17,960
to herself, really.

1447
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:23,830
You know,

1448
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:23,830
she's just a very sad,

1449
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:23,830
troubled young lady.

1450
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:28,300
Okay, it's my fault

1451
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:28,300
that she's gone.

1452
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:31,330
If I hadn't made you

1453
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:31,330
come out of her room

1454
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:31,330
in the first place,

1455
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,000
then she'd still be here.

1456
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,000
She wouldn't have left.

1457
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:35,000
Anna, it is not your fault.

1458
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:35,000
Trust me.

1459
00:38:35,310 --> 00:38:36,870
She wanted to leave.

1460
00:38:35,310 --> 00:38:36,870
She was gonna find a way.

1461
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:39,310
Yeah, but I keep

1462
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:39,310
screwing up.

1463
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:42,280
I bet you wish

1464
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:42,280
that I'd gone to live

1465
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:42,280
with Mom instead.

1466
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,780
I don't wish that.

1467
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,780
Not even a bit.

1468
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:49,010
Okay, but look at everything

1469
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:49,010
that you do for me, and then,

1470
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:49,010
look what I do.

1471
00:38:51,090 --> 00:38:53,790
Anna, honey,

1472
00:38:51,090 --> 00:38:53,790
I'm your dad.

1473
00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:56,330
Okay, you don't

1474
00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:56,330
owe me anything,

1475
00:38:56,430 --> 00:38:58,590
nor is it your job

1476
00:38:56,430 --> 00:38:58,590
to please me.

1477
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:03,930
But it is my job to do

1478
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:03,930
everything I can to

1479
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:03,930
help you thrive in life.

1480
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,600
But, honey,

1481
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,600
that's not gonna matter

1482
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:07,610
if I can't keep you safe

1483
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:07,610
in the first place.

1484
00:39:08,610 --> 00:39:09,630
Right, which is

1485
00:39:08,610 --> 00:39:09,630
why, honey,

1486
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:13,080
I can't just fling open

1487
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:13,080
the barn door

1488
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:13,080
and let you roam around.

1489
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:16,040
You understand

1490
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:16,040
that, right?

1491
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:27,880
Oh.

1492
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:41,670
Oh. Thank you, honey.

1493
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,100
But I'm just...

1494
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,100
Really, I'm not hungry.

1495
00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:47,380
Mom, you need to eat.

1496
00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:47,380
Mmm.

1497
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,880
And remember what

1498
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,880
Dr. Young said about

1499
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,880
staying hydrated.

1500
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:54,710
Here you go.

1501
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:54,710
Thank you.

1502
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:55,980
Mmm-hmm.

1503
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:04,500
Do you think

1504
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:04,500
that I made a mistake

1505
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:07,900
by not agreeing

1506
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:07,900
to have the other surgery?

1507
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:13,070
I don't think

1508
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:13,070
it's a bad thing to take

1509
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:13,070
your time and think about it.

1510
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:14,730
Mmm.

1511
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,570
But in the meantime...

1512
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:21,870
I want you to take these.

1513
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:27,780
Dr. Young

1514
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:27,780
didn't mention new meds.

1515
00:40:27,890 --> 00:40:29,450
They're from

1516
00:40:27,890 --> 00:40:29,450
a different doctor.

1517
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,960
I showed him your chart,

1518
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,960
and he thought these

1519
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,960
would work well for you.

1520
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:33,490
He said they've been

1521
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:33,490
really beneficial

1522
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:35,030
for patients

1523
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:35,030
with heart failure.

1524
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:37,150
Okay.

1525
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,070
Let's have at it.

1526
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,070
Yeah.
