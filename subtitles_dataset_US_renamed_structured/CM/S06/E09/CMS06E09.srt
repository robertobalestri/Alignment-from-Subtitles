1
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:08,400
Dean Archer, my senior

2
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:08,400
medical officer in the Navy.

3
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:11,200
Why don't you shadow me to

4
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:11,200
get the lay of the land?

5
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:13,100
It's an ED, I think

6
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:13,100
I know the lay.

7
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:15,600
There is one thing

8
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:15,600
I need to be clear about.

9
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:18,010
In this ED, I'm in charge.

10
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,110
The trial needs a chance to

11
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,110
prove the drug can work.

12
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:23,150
I can help you start sorting

13
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:23,150
through those files.

14
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:24,680
Thanks, April.

15
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:28,420
Wouldn't it be great

16
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:28,420
if the boys could

17
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:28,420
grow up together?

18
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:29,990
They wanna adopt Auggie.

19
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:34,500
See how happy

20
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:34,500
he was today?

21
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:34,500
It's okay, baby.

22
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:36,990
He should be with his brother.

23
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:46,270
Auggie's gone, huh?

24
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:46,270
Mm-hmm.

25
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,170
Took off with the Carters

26
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,170
this morning.

27
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,720
I'm heading over to

28
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,720
the Med thrift shop to donate

29
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,720
the stuff he left behind.

30
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:54,540
Must be hard right now.

31
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:58,380
Mm, he's with his brother.

32
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:58,380
He's safe, he's happy.

33
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:01,580
When Ben and I took him in,

34
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:01,580
that's all we wanted for him.

35
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:04,560
And you'll stay in contact?

36
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:04,560
Yeah, we're talking about

37
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:06,530
heading out to California

38
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:06,530
to see him this summer.

39
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,090
It'll be here

40
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,090
before you know it.

41
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:10,620
Yeah.

42
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:23,040
Morning, Dr. Manning.

43
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:23,040
Good morning, Dr. Marcel.

44
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,340
How's your mom recuperating?

45
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,340
Any problems with the LVAD?

46
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:27,810
She's feeling great.

47
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:27,810
Yes?

48
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,810
She wanted me to

49
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,810
express her gratitude.

50
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:33,150
Oh, well, you know,

51
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:33,150
I hear it's important

52
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,190
to impress the mom

53
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,190
when squiring the daughter.

54
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:40,130
I so wanna make out

55
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:40,130
with you right now.

56
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:41,390
Oh.

57
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:43,200
But not here.

58
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:46,270
Perhaps another time

59
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:46,270
then, milady.

60
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,680
Hey, Will. Do you have

61
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,680
any updates on

62
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,680
the clinical trial?

63
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:58,110
I have some

64
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:58,110
free time now.

65
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,310
Well, last few days I've just

66
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,310
been combing through data.

67
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:02,480
Kind of a one-person job.

68
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,580
Maybe I can search

69
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,580
the recent patient files,

70
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:06,420
see if any of them

71
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:06,420
are good candidates?

72
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,680
Sure. That'd be great.

73
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:16,290
Ramona Davis, 30 years old.

74
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:16,290
BP, 122 over 80. HR, 115.

75
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,700
SATS, 100%.

76
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:21,700
Ramona, what happened?

77
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:21,700
My foot, it's excruciating.

78
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,670
Dispatch told us

79
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,670
she called 911 after

80
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:25,740
shooting herself in the foot

81
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:25,740
with a nail gun.

82
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,840
How'd you get that gash

83
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,840
on your head?

84
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:29,810
She was passed out

85
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:29,810
when we found her.

86
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,740
Yeah, 'cause it

87
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,740
hurts like hell.

88
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:33,750
Okay, well, we're gonna

89
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:33,750
take good care of ya,

90
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:34,840
and then give you

91
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:34,840
something for the pain.

92
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,680
One, two, three.

93
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,150
Thanks, guys.

94
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:44,790
Okay. Breath

95
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:44,790
sounds bilaterally.

96
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:48,830
Ramona, can you move your head

97
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:48,830
up and down, side to side?

98
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,730
Good. C-spine's clear.

99
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:53,500
Let's get a head CT

100
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:53,500
on the books.

101
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:55,760
Wait a minute,

102
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:55,760
where where am I?

103
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:57,900
You're at the hospital,

104
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:57,900
Ramona. You had an accident.

105
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:00,680
No, no, no, which...

106
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:00,680
Which hospital?

107
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:01,800
Chicago Med.

108
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,510
I was supposed

109
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,510
to go to East Mercy.

110
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:07,410
Don't worry. We're gonna

111
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:07,410
take good care of you here.

112
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,780
Need to get that shoe off

113
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,780
to get an X-ray.

114
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,790
No, don't, don't. Don't.

115
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:13,220
Ramona, we're just trying to

116
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:13,220
figure out the best way to get

117
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:13,220
this all...

118
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:17,190
No, I said don't touch it!

119
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:17,190
No doctor at Chicago Med

120
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:17,190
is treating me!

121
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:19,160
Okay, ma'am, please.

122
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:19,160
No.

123
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,630
All right.

124
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:22,350
No!

125
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:22,350
I need restraints.

126
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:27,800
It's okay, it's okay,

127
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:27,800
settle down.

128
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,350
I was nailing down

129
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,350
some lattice!

130
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:44,750
I thought I was aiming

131
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:44,750
the nail gun at the ground.

132
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:44,750
I shot myself.

133
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,750
It was stupid.

134
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,750
Can I... Can I go now?

135
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,790
Yeah, but you you told us

136
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,790
that you fell and

137
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,790
you hit your head.

138
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:52,950
To knock yourself out,

139
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:52,950
you gotta assume that's gonna

140
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:52,950
be a pretty serious bump.

141
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:56,290
But I'm sure they can

142
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:56,290
figure it out at East Mercy.

143
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,700
So, you wanna go to East Mercy

144
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,700
because you think that

145
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,670
you're gonna get better

146
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,670
treatment there?

147
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:04,210
Yeah, they don't tie you

148
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:04,210
to your bed.

149
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:07,770
Huh.

150
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:10,970
Well, look, if you think

151
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:10,970
that you can

152
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:10,970
calm down a little bit,

153
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,940
I don't see why

154
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,940
we can't take those off.

155
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:14,810
How does that sound?

156
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,850
Okay.

157
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:28,630
Great. Great.

158
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,530
Can you send me

159
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,530
to East Mercy now?

160
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,300
Ramona, we are required

161
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,300
to make sure you're stable

162
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,390
before we transfer you.

163
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:41,500
There is a nail in my foot.

164
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:41,500
It is not going to kill me.

165
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:44,940
No, but let us do

166
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:44,940
a CT, okay?

167
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:46,840
Make sure there's no serious

168
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:46,840
injury from your fall,

169
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:48,640
and then we'll send you

170
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:48,640
on your way.

171
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:52,650
If that's what

172
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:52,650
it takes, okay. Okay.

173
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,020
I'll let radiology know.

174
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:57,960
But no one touches the nail.

175
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,600
Yeah. You're welcome.

176
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,600
Thank you.

177
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:17,670
Hey, care for a cup?

178
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:17,670
They poured me

179
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:17,670
an extra one by mistake.

180
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,480
Thanks, but I'm trying

181
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,480
to kick caffeine.

182
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:21,020
Oh, more for me then.

183
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:23,970
Scheduling, huh?

184
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,510
Yeah.

185
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,950
More 12-hour shifts.

186
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:32,020
I liked to stick to

187
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:32,020
eight hour shifts back

188
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:32,020
when I was running Milbrook.

189
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:33,850
Keeps the troops fresh.

190
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:38,060
Yeah, we tried that.

191
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:38,060
But I found this

192
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:38,060
is better for patient care.

193
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:39,800
Less handovers.

194
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:44,870
Well, sure as long as you

195
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:44,870
don't burn your team out

196
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:44,870
in the process.

197
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:46,640
Well...

198
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:46,640
Huh?

199
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:49,300
Specifically, if they're

200
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:49,300
not drinking caffeine.

201
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:52,650
Hey, I've been meaning

202
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:52,650
to ask you. How are you

203
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:52,650
adjusting so far?

204
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:55,840
It's a good fit.

205
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:55,840
And, uh, you and me?

206
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:58,320
I'm good. I'm good

207
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:58,320
with the chain of command.

208
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:01,080
Dr. Choi? I could use

209
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:01,080
another set of eyes.

210
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:03,690
I just sent you the deets.

211
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:03,690
Yeah, sure.

212
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:05,560
We should grab a drink

213
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:05,560
after work, hm?

214
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,020
Aye, aye, Captain.

215
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:08,620
Is that right?

216
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:08,620
Yeah.

217
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:11,430
Mr. and Mrs. Campos?

218
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:11,430
Hi, I'm Dr. Choi.

219
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:14,970
Louisa, please.

220
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:14,970
And this is Hector.

221
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:16,700
I hear you're having some

222
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:16,700
trouble breathing.

223
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:19,740
Patient's reported

224
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:19,740
a fever that spikes up

225
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:19,740
and down erratically,

226
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,940
a sustained period

227
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,940
of shortness of breath.

228
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:26,570
Looks like your ears

229
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:26,570
are swollen. Does it hurt

230
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:26,570
when I touch it?

231
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,980
It's pretty itchy too.

232
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,980
Yeah? Okay.

233
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,950
Can you tell me when

234
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,950
was the first time

235
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,950
you started feeling sick?

236
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:34,890
About three days ago.

237
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:37,620
He works at a meat-packing

238
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:37,620
plant out in Cicero.

239
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:40,360
They've had a bunch of

240
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:40,360
COVID outbreaks in the past.

241
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:42,020
I was worried that

242
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:42,020
there might be another.

243
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:44,600
I'm just... I'm so relieved

244
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:44,600
that that test

245
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:44,600
came out negative.

246
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:45,760
It's a good start.

247
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:47,960
We're supposed to see

248
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:47,960
our granddaughter

249
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:47,960
in two weeks.

250
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:49,730
She's turning one.

251
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,770
We still haven't met her

252
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,770
due to social distancing.

253
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,030
Sure.

254
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:55,110
His lungs sound congested.

255
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:55,110
How are his sats?

256
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:56,670
89 and trending lower.

257
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:58,540
All right. Let's up him to

258
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:58,540
high-flow cannula.

259
00:06:58,650 --> 00:06:59,640
Okay.

260
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,050
What do you think

261
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,050
this might be?

262
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:04,080
Hard to say. Perhaps

263
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:04,080
some kind of pneumonia.

264
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:07,820
But let's grab a chest X-ray

265
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:07,820
and a CT to rule out PE.

266
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:11,380
Also, a CBC, BMP, blood

267
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:11,380
and urine cultures as well.

268
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:12,720
Roger.

269
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,590
We'll figure out

270
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,590
what's causing this, okay?

271
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,690
Excuse me.

272
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,690
Thank you.

273
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:22,930
This here is a subdural

274
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:22,930
hematoma with mass effect.

275
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,100
So what?

276
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:27,840
Ramona, you have a bleed

277
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:27,840
in your brain from

278
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:27,840
where you hit your head.

279
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:29,070
Not gonna stop on its own.

280
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,880
It requires a craniotomy.

281
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,880
It's a pretty

282
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,880
significant surgery.

283
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,740
We had a deal.

284
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:38,180
I get the scan that

285
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:38,180
you wanted, you let me go

286
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:38,180
to the hospital of my choice.

287
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:40,720
If you don't treat this soon,

288
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:40,720
you will die.

289
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:43,190
So let me go treat it.

290
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:47,190
Ramona, could you give us

291
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:47,190
a second? Dr. Halstead.

292
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:54,460
Okay. What is with her

293
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:54,460
and East Mercy?

294
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:57,560
I have no idea, but I think

295
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:57,560
we gotta let her go.

296
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:01,810
Wait, what? This bleed in her

297
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:01,810
brain is a ticking time bomb.

298
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:03,570
Which is why we have to

299
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:03,570
do it right now.

300
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,510
Right, she's clearly not

301
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,510
gonna change her mind.

302
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:06,710
So, the sooner we

303
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:06,710
get her over there,

304
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:07,980
the sooner she gets

305
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:07,980
the treatment she needs.

306
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:13,120
All right, I'll arrange

307
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:13,120
the transfer.

308
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:16,210
I'll set up the ambo

309
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:16,210
and forward her scans

310
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:16,210
over to East Mercy.

311
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:24,760
Natalie?

312
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:27,570
Darby!

313
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:31,040
Hi! I haven't seen you

314
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:31,040
in, like, forever.

315
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:31,040
Yeah.

316
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,630
It's been over

317
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,630
a year now.

318
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:35,140
Wow. Our kids go

319
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:35,140
to preschool together.

320
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,940
Oh.

321
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,940
How's Owen been doing?

322
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:40,080
He's driving his

323
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:40,080
grandmother crazy.

324
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:40,080
How's Sebastian?

325
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:42,880
Driving me crazy.

326
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:42,880
I forgot you worked here.

327
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,110
I would have

328
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,110
asked to see you.

329
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:46,210
You're in good hands

330
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:46,210
with Dr. Archer here.

331
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,110
If you don't mind me asking,

332
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,110
what brought you in today?

333
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:49,820
A pain you would not believe.

334
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,950
Like someone's stabbing me

335
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,950
with a harpoon.

336
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:54,590
Well, I don't see

337
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:54,590
anything here that's acute,

338
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:58,130
but I would like to send you

339
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:58,130
to get a CT scan

340
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:58,130
if you don't mind.

341
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,060
That should give us

342
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,060
a clearer picture.

343
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:02,600
Sure. CT away.

344
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:02,600
Okay.

345
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,040
Hopefully we can get

346
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,040
the kids together soon.

347
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:07,510
Yeah.

348
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:07,510
See ya.

349
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:09,700
Hey, Dean?

350
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:09,700
About that ultrasound.

351
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:10,970
Mm-hmm?

352
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,640
So, I'm not trying to step

353
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,640
on any toes here,

354
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,610
and maybe you didn't want

355
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,610
to say anything in front

356
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,610
of the patient,

357
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,710
but I was seeing some swelling

358
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,710
around the gallbladder.

359
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:21,850
Well, perhaps but the

360
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:21,850
bile duct was still

361
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:21,850
normal-size in character.

362
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,950
There's no evidence

363
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,950
of stones or fluid

364
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,950
around the gallbladder

365
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:26,530
and only a mild amount

366
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:26,530
of thickening.

367
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:29,690
But the gallbladder wall was

368
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:29,690
inflamed. And it's not normal.

369
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,790
And it could still be

370
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,790
causing her symptoms.

371
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:35,670
Why don't we wait for the CT

372
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:35,670
scan before jumping to any

373
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:35,670
conclusions, okay?

374
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:41,680
Um, excuse me?

375
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:43,710
Where can I put this

376
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:43,710
for donation?

377
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,310
Leave it on the counter.

378
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,310
Okay.

379
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:47,710
Thanks.

380
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:51,650
Um, this baby blanket.

381
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:51,650
How much is it?

382
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:55,090
Five dollars.

383
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:55,090
Oh, too much.

384
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:01,720
Here. And I'll keep this.

385
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:01,720
I've changed my mind.

386
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:02,820
Okay.

387
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:11,740
Hi. I couldn't help

388
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:11,740
but overhear over there.

389
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,230
It's big for a baby blanket,

390
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,230
but it's teddy bear-soft.

391
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:19,740
How much is it?

392
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:19,740
I'm on a tight budget.

393
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:22,310
No, it's a gift.

394
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:22,310
You mean it?

395
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,580
Yeah. Please.

396
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:27,020
Thank you so much.

397
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,150
My pleasure. I'm Maggie,

398
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,150
by the way.

399
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:30,720
Tionne.

400
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,230
Is this your first?

401
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,230
Mm-hmm.

402
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:34,820
You have kids?

403
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:37,220
I... Tionne...

404
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:40,240
You're bleeding.

405
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:40,240
Oh, my God.

406
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:43,740
I got you. I'm a nurse over at

407
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:43,740
Med around the corner.

408
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:46,070
Get me an ambulance, please.

409
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:48,870
I can't afford

410
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:48,870
a fancy hospital

411
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:48,870
like Chicago Med.

412
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:52,140
It won't be an issue,

413
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:52,140
I promise you. Just hold

414
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:52,140
on to me, okay?

415
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,270
We'll figure it out.

416
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,950
Tionne stopped hemorrhaging

417
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,950
once we arrived.

418
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:00,780
How are you feeling otherwise?

419
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:03,950
Fine, till today.

420
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:03,950
This will pinch.

421
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:06,860
All right, Tionne, I wanna

422
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:06,860
give you an exam.

423
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,900
But first, I wanna do an

424
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,900
ultrasound to see where

425
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,900
your placenta is.

426
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,860
Did your doctor tell you

427
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,860
your placenta's low?

428
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:14,700
No, I don't got a doctor.

429
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:14,700
I have no insurance.

430
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:18,630
All right, I'm gonna press

431
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:18,630
this down on your belly

432
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:19,760
and take a look, okay?

433
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,240
All right.

434
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:25,140
Well, let's look.

435
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:30,280
Okay. Well, your placenta

436
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:30,280
is covering your cervix.

437
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:34,290
Tionne, it's probably what

438
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:34,290
caused the bleeding.

439
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:35,920
Is the baby okay?

440
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:38,960
It appears so, yes. But I'm

441
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:38,960
gonna take a look inside now

442
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,260
and see what's going on. Okay?

443
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,130
Okay.

444
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,130
Thank you.

445
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:47,860
Tionne, you're bleeding

446
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:47,860
heavily again.

447
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:49,700
We need to get you

448
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:49,700
to the operating room.

449
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,930
The operating room?

450
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,010
Yes, you need surgery

451
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,010
to deliver your baby.

452
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:54,170
Cut me open?

453
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,030
It's what's best

454
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,030
for your baby.

455
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:59,400
Okay?

456
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:59,400
Tionne, is there

457
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:59,400
anyone that we can call?

458
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:01,210
Someone that should be

459
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:01,210
here with you right now?

460
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:04,350
My mom's taking care of

461
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:04,350
my grandma downstate.

462
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:06,180
She can't get here

463
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:06,180
till tomorrow.

464
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,790
Can Maggie come with?

465
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:12,190
So someone's there for

466
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:12,190
the baby while I'm asleep?

467
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,760
You're gonna be fine, Tionne.

468
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:20,790
Okay.

469
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:24,340
This picture

470
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:24,340
is showing some

471
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:24,340
bilateral infiltrates.

472
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:27,000
I'm confused.

473
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:27,000
Does he have pneumonia or not?

474
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,810
Certainly not full-blown

475
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,810
pneumonia at this point, no.

476
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:31,470
Do you see the tips of

477
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:31,470
his fingers and toes?

478
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:32,840
How blue they're getting?

479
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:35,780
The scans show he has a lot

480
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:35,780
of inflammation in his body.

481
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,280
It could be affecting his

482
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,280
circulation.

483
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:40,840
If I don't make it through

484
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:40,840
this, give my cross

485
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:40,840
to the baby.

486
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,920
Hector. Don't talk like that.

487
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:44,410
Yeah, okay.

488
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:48,400
Let's up his oxygen,

489
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:48,400
get a mask on him.

490
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,930
Hey, Hector.

491
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:52,900
If I had to guess, you've got

492
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:52,900
some kind of infection.

493
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:56,900
So, we're gonna start you

494
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:56,900
on some broad

495
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:56,900
spectrum antibiotics,

496
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:58,200
see what effect they have.

497
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:01,070
And in the meantime,

498
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:01,070
we'll take a closer look

499
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:01,070
at your blood,

500
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,240
try to get our arms around

501
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,240
what's going on. Okay?

502
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:07,980
It's okay, go on.

503
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,110
Something's not

504
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,110
adding up, Dr. Choi.

505
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:13,120
His symptoms say

506
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:13,120
pneumonia for sure.

507
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:17,190
But he's not producing

508
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:17,190
a steady cough and his

509
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:17,190
white count's totally normal.

510
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,150
And then there's

511
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,150
that crazy ear thing.

512
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:22,160
Sorry to be a buttinski,

513
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:22,160
but I love a tricky diagnosis.

514
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,960
Do you mind if I take a look?

515
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,960
Sure.

516
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:25,090
Thanks.

517
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:28,000
You think maybe

518
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:28,000
it's an HIV-related syndrome?

519
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,330
Let's test to

520
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,330
definitively rule it out.

521
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:33,770
Also, scan his legs, see if

522
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:33,770
there's any signs of a DVT.

523
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:37,210
Well, you'd have seen them on

524
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:37,210
the scan if it was a pulmonary

525
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:37,210
embolism, no?

526
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:40,540
No, I think young Driskell

527
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:40,540
here is on to something.

528
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:43,280
His inflammation of

529
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:43,280
the ear cartilage, yeah?

530
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:48,050
Dr. Choi thinks it's most

531
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:48,050
likely a rash or a reaction

532
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:48,050
to the infection.

533
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,180
Or it could be the key

534
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,180
to this whole thing.

535
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,450
You know, they say if you hear

536
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,450
hoofbeats, think horses.

537
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:56,530
But if I were you,

538
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:56,530
Dr. Driskell, I'd be

539
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:56,530
on the lookout for zebras.

540
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:59,860
Maybe sarcoidosis,

541
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:59,860
or peripheral vasculitis.

542
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,060
I'm gonna hold off

543
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,060
on that, Dean.

544
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:04,270
Give the antibiotics

545
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:04,270
a chance to take effect.

546
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:05,840
Occam's Razor and all.

547
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:08,970
I want to check off

548
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:08,970
all the boxes before

549
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:08,970
we go hunting for zebras.

550
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,070
That's certainly

551
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,070
a viable strategy as well.

552
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,470
Dr. Archer?

553
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:15,350
CT just sent over the scans

554
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:15,350
you requested

555
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:15,350
for Treatment-Four.

556
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:16,940
Thank you.

557
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:16,940
Uh-huh.

558
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:18,880
And I apologize

559
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:18,880
if I overstepped.

560
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,590
Okay, could you

561
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,590
hold on, please?

562
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:27,380
Dr. Charles, wait.

563
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:31,130
I am on the line with East

564
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:31,130
Mercy. There's a problem.

565
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:33,470
I'm not treating her.

566
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:36,900
Ramona Davis has been

567
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:36,900
trouble for a long time.

568
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,200
Frequent flier?

569
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,200
Yes.

570
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:41,210
Every two, three weeks

571
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:41,210
for the past year.

572
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:44,210
She shows up,

573
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:44,210
insists that only I treat her.

574
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:45,440
She's obsessed with me.

575
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:49,380
Last week she came in,

576
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:49,380
she claimed she'd lost

577
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:49,380
feeling in her hands,

578
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,390
but it was clear she was

579
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,390
making it up.

580
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:54,510
And was this the first time

581
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:54,510
it seemed like she was

582
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:54,510
faking symptoms?

583
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:57,520
The first time I called

584
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:57,520
her on it. She flipped out.

585
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:00,920
Accused me of malpractice,

586
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:00,920
threatened to sue me,

587
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:03,220
the hospital.

588
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:03,220
It got pretty intense.

589
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,360
You know, that might explain

590
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,360
why she showed up

591
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,360
with a nail in her foot.

592
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:09,160
I mean, if she had actually

593
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:09,160
made it over to you today,

594
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:11,070
there's no way you could say

595
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:11,070
she was making that up.

596
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:13,540
Excuse me, Dr. Bridges.

597
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:13,540
Look, I've gotta run.

598
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:19,280
I hope Ramona gets the help

599
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:19,280
she needs, but I can't be

600
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:19,280
the one to give it to her.

601
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:22,110
Completely get it. Thank you

602
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:22,110
for your time, Doctor.

603
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:24,510
I'll cancel the ambo.

604
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:26,590
So, if you're right and she

605
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:26,590
injured herself with the nail,

606
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:27,950
then you can put her

607
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:27,950
on a psych hold.

608
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:30,020
But even on a hold,

609
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:30,020
she could still

610
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:30,020
refuse surgery.

611
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:33,120
Yeah, she still has

612
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:33,120
decisional capacity. Right?

613
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:36,430
Okay, but we gotta

614
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:36,430
convince her to stay

615
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:36,430
and have the surgery.

616
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:38,930
Her life is at stake.

617
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:48,640
Dean? Darby says you're

618
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:48,640
discharging her?

619
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:51,270
I wrote her a script for

620
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:51,270
extra-strength PEPCID.

621
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:52,370
See how she fares.

622
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,070
You mind if I take

623
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,070
a look at the CT?

624
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:03,690
See. Nothing here

625
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:03,690
tells a different story

626
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:03,690
than the ultrasound.

627
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,620
It still seems to me that

628
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,620
the gallbladder's infected.

629
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:10,390
Well, I disagree, and I'm

630
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:10,390
just trying to spare

631
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:10,390
the patient an operation.

632
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,360
Well, what if it's

633
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,360
an operation that she needs?

634
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:14,940
Maybe a second opinion from

635
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:14,940
a surgeon is warranted?

636
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:19,130
Well, I also happen to be

637
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:19,130
a board-certified

638
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:19,130
surgeon myself.

639
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:22,610
But thanks very much for your

640
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:22,610
input, Dr. Manning.

641
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:23,700
Excuse me.

642
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:31,120
Thank you.

643
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:37,220
What doctor refuses

644
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:37,220
to treat a patient?

645
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:41,190
My dad was a doctor,

646
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:44,600
and he went out of his way to

647
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:44,600
help anyone who needed it no

648
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:44,600
matter what.

649
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,500
You know, I can't speak

650
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,500
for your father,

651
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:51,060
but I know plenty of doctors

652
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:51,060
who decide not to engage

653
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:51,060
with patients,

654
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:53,160
you know, for

655
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:53,160
a number of reasons.

656
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:54,560
Like what?

657
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,650
Well, for instance, let's say

658
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,650
if a doctor feels that

659
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,180
there's a lack of boundaries.

660
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:03,340
Boundaries? Between

661
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:03,340
Dr. Bridges and me?

662
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:06,320
Listen, Dr. Bridges made

663
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:06,320
it very clear to me,

664
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:10,020
it's important to him

665
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:10,020
that you get the

666
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:10,020
medical care that you need.

667
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,220
He did?

668
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,580
Yeah.

669
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:17,230
Well, I...

670
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:23,760
I do know that doctors won't

671
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:23,760
operate on their loved ones.

672
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:26,670
That's right.

673
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:26,670
It's considered

674
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:26,670
an ethical issue

675
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:29,300
if a doctor is too close

676
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:29,300
to their patient.

677
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:35,670
Of course. Dr. Bridges

678
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:35,670
has feelings for me.

679
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:37,650
It all makes sense now.

680
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:41,520
In any case, how about

681
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:41,520
we get you the surgery?

682
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:45,390
Okay.

683
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:45,390
Great.

684
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:48,220
Is there anybody

685
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:48,220
that you would

686
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:48,220
like me to call, or...

687
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:52,060
But could you

688
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:52,060
call Dr. Bridges,

689
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:54,260
and let him know that

690
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:54,260
I'm getting the operation?

691
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:57,570
I'll be happy to do

692
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:57,570
that for ya. Oh, and

693
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:57,570
how about

694
00:17:57,670 --> 00:17:59,770
I tell the surgeons

695
00:17:57,670 --> 00:17:59,770
to take that nail

696
00:17:57,670 --> 00:17:59,770
out of your foot,

697
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:01,370
while they're at it?

698
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:01,370
What do you say?

699
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,470
Okay.

700
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:08,480
Great. Okay.

701
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:08,480
I'll be back in a bit.

702
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:14,110
Ultrasound for Mr. Campos

703
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:14,110
came up clean. There's

704
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:14,110
no evidence of DVT.

705
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:15,710
Dr. Choi!

706
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:22,360
My Hector can't breathe!

707
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:22,360
Sats in the 70s.

708
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,450
Please.

709
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,450
Heart rate's dropping too.

710
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,230
BP 97 over 68.

711
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:26,700
Hector! He's not

712
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:26,700
protecting his airway.

713
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,830
We need to intubate.

714
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,830
20 of etomidate, 100 of sux.

715
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,760
He was all right a minute ago.

716
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:34,170
Oh, my God.

717
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:34,170
Please don't let him die!

718
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:37,400
Why is this happening?

719
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:57,390
Baby's not coming,

720
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:57,390
I need to extend

721
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:57,390
my hysterotomy.

722
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:00,700
When I say now, Maggie,

723
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:00,700
give me fundal pressure.

724
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,560
Got it.

725
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:05,730
Now.

726
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,110
All right, see.

727
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:14,410
There we go.

728
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:17,620
Suction.

729
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:17,620
All righty.

730
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:19,240
Okay, buddy.

731
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:20,510
I got him.

732
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:21,850
Here we go.

733
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:24,480
There.

734
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:29,160
Heart rate is 140.

735
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:29,160
And get ready to rotate.

736
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,720
Huh.

737
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:35,330
Is that a dimple?

738
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:37,470
Unfortunately, yes.

739
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,700
So, your gallbladder

740
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,700
appears to be inflamed

741
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:48,540
and I suggest we remove it.

742
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:48,540
Better safe than sorry.

743
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,720
Now, it's a relatively

744
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,720
simple procedure.

745
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:53,220
I'll go in with an

746
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:53,220
itty bitty little scope

747
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,190
and just slide it

748
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,190
right out of there.

749
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:58,850
You'll barely

750
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:58,850
notice the scars.

751
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:58,850
And this pain will go away?

752
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,220
Possibly, if the gallbladder

753
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,220
is the issue.

754
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:02,890
Which I believe it is.

755
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:07,730
Okay, then. I'm here

756
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:07,730
already so...

757
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,460
Let's do it.

758
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,460
Okay.

759
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:11,770
We'll get you upstairs

760
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:11,770
in a jiff. All right?

761
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:13,470
Thank you.

762
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:13,470
You bet.

763
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:15,600
Doc...

764
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:20,580
Have them set up for a

765
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:20,580
laparoscopic cholecystectomy

766
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:20,580
pronto, would you?

767
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,270
Yeah.

768
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,270
Great.

769
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:25,820
Boy, boy, boy. You two

770
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:25,820
must be pretty pleased

771
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:25,820
with yourselves, aren't you?

772
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,620
Excuse me?

773
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,620
Yeah.

774
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:31,350
The only way a patient can get

775
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:31,350
a second opinion in the ED

776
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:34,450
is to ask for

777
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:34,450
a doctor by name.

778
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:34,450
So?

779
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,430
So Darby's never even been

780
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,430
a patient here in Med.

781
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:39,860
There's no way she'd know who

782
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:39,860
you were. Unless somebody

783
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:39,860
slipped her your name.

784
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:44,200
Dean, I understand

785
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:44,200
you're upset. Okay? No one

786
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:44,200
likes to be disagreed with.

787
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:45,770
You went behind my back.

788
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:49,370
Regardless of how this played

789
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:49,370
out, Dean, I'm involved now

790
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,500
and I happen to agree with

791
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,500
Dr. Manning's diagnosis.

792
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:54,480
Okay. You also happen

793
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:54,480
to be in cahoots.

794
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:56,280
I'm sorry. Cahoots?

795
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,820
You guys are

796
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,820
having an intimate

797
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,820
relationship, right?

798
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,220
Aren't you?

799
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:03,420
We are professional

800
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:03,420
colleagues. And that is

801
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:03,420
all that should concern you.

802
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,290
This morning, I saw

803
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,290
the way you two were

804
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,290
looking at each other.

805
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:10,430
Okay, forget that guy.

806
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:11,690
Mm-hmm.

807
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,290
You okay?

808
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,290
Yeah.

809
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,370
All right, I'm gonna

810
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,370
head upstairs.

811
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:18,440
You page me if you need me.

812
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:18,440
Okay.

813
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:27,710
Just forwarded you

814
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:27,710
a new patient chart

815
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:27,710
from Sunday.

816
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:29,480
Stage two heart failure,

817
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,020
might be a good

818
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,020
candidate for the trial.

819
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,880
All right. Let me take a look.

820
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:36,650
Sabeena. Nice to see you.

821
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:39,780
I have a meeting upstairs.

822
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:39,780
Can I borrow you for a moment?

823
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:42,330
Sure. Be right back.

824
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:47,670
Good news. We're closing

825
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:47,670
enrollment on the trial.

826
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:49,670
Turns out you're such

827
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:49,670
an effective recruiter,

828
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:52,400
we have more than enough data

829
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:52,400
to work with moving forward.

830
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,600
Well, that is good news.

831
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:59,370
Kender's CEO

832
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:59,370
asked if you golf.

833
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:03,650
I do not golf. But give me

834
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:03,650
a week and I'll figure it out.

835
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:06,980
I expect nothing

836
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:06,980
less from you.

837
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:15,320
This patient I sent you

838
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:15,320
might be perfect.

839
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:17,300
Dr. Virani just told me

840
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:17,300
we're closing admissions.

841
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,030
So you can stop

842
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,030
looking for candidates,

843
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:22,740
but refer that one to

844
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:22,740
cardiology. Thanks anyway.

845
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:30,080
Bone marrow biopsy

846
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:30,080
came back negative.

847
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:33,610
We CAT scanned his brain,

848
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:33,610
abdomen and pelvis.

849
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:36,050
All totally normal.

850
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:36,050
No evidence of malignancy.

851
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:38,550
Maybe we should be looking for

852
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:38,550
autoimmune issues.

853
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:41,020
Perhaps, but his

854
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:41,020
ANA is normal.

855
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,890
You can't rule out

856
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,890
an autoimmune

857
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,890
disorder entirely,

858
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:49,450
but a tissue biopsy suggests

859
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:49,450
it's not sarcoidosis.

860
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:51,690
So, in other words

861
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:51,690
we still don't know anything?

862
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:54,730
You might wanna get

863
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:54,730
Infectious Disease on this.

864
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,330
Thanks, Doc.

865
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:02,570
Ethan, if you don't mind,

866
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:02,570
I've been giving your

867
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:02,570
case some thought,

868
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:06,010
and based on the

869
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:06,010
symptoms that your

870
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:06,010
patient's been exhibiting,

871
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:09,570
I think he may have some rare

872
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:09,570
auto-inflammatory syndrome...

873
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,810
It's called VEXAS.

874
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:12,980
VEXAS? Never heard of that.

875
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:17,050
Yeah, it's a genetic mutation.

876
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:17,050
They've only diagnosed,

877
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:17,050
like, 25 cases.

878
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,420
Symptoms include

879
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,420
blood clots, fevers,

880
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:21,590
inflammation of the cartilage

881
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:21,590
and lung tissue.

882
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:24,860
It would certainly

883
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:24,860
explain the crazy

884
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:24,860
constellation of symptoms,

885
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:27,030
but I'm still not

886
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:27,030
looking for zebras yet.

887
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:29,660
You know what,

888
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:29,660
I'm sorry for getting

889
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:29,660
in your face over this.

890
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:32,670
But I just don't wanna

891
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:32,670
be doing to you what

892
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:32,670
was done to me.

893
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:34,830
What are you talking about?

894
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:39,970
Uh... Some doctor sticking

895
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:39,970
his neck in, questioning

896
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:39,970
the care I'm giving.

897
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:41,770
Who?

898
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,880
I was just double doc'd by

899
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,880
Manning and Marcel.

900
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:49,450
They sent my patient

901
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:49,450
up to surgery against

902
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:49,450
my medical advice.

903
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:53,020
Okay.

904
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:53,020
Yeah. And they're

905
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:53,020
secretly dating,

906
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:56,630
which frankly raises

907
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:56,630
ethical concerns.

908
00:23:57,830 --> 00:24:01,790
I didn't know. But, plenty

909
00:23:57,830 --> 00:24:01,790
of doctors have

910
00:23:57,830 --> 00:24:01,790
dated in the past.

911
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:05,630
I admit I have myself.

912
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:05,630
It's never really been

913
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:05,630
an issue before.

914
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:07,670
Well, but you can see

915
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:07,670
how it would be, right?

916
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,770
Let's say they made

917
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,770
a mistake with this patient,

918
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:12,140
it could make them susceptible

919
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:12,140
to a malpractice suit.

920
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:14,920
And you gotta believe that the

921
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:14,920
hospital would want cover over

922
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:14,920
something like that.

923
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,180
I hear you, Dean,

924
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,180
but honestly,

925
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,040
I've got bigger issues

926
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,040
to deal with at the moment.

927
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:19,750
Well, it's your ship.

928
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,830
Here he is!

929
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:31,100
I'm Dr. Watkins, Tionne.

930
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:31,100
Meet your baby boy.

931
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:33,160
Oh, my God.

932
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:36,800
He's so beautiful.

933
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:36,800
Yes, he is.

934
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:39,800
I can't believe he's mine.

935
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:43,000
When can I take him home?

936
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:46,510
I want to keep him under

937
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:46,510
observation for a few weeks,

938
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:48,580
on account of how

939
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:48,580
early he was.

940
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:52,680
You should also know that

941
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:52,680
he has a birth defect.

942
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:55,180
Spina bifida occulta.

943
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,990
What does that mean?

944
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:03,100
His vertebrae didn't

945
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:03,100
fully form in utero.

946
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:09,500
There are small gaps

947
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:09,500
in between the bones

948
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:09,500
of his spine.

949
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:13,910
Is he going to live?

950
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:13,910
Oh, yes. I know it sounds bad,

951
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:18,970
but I've seen many babies

952
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:18,970
born with spina bifida

953
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:18,970
who grow up to be just fine.

954
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:24,080
How did it happen?

955
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:24,080
It could've been

956
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:24,080
a number of things.

957
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:25,950
Your genetics.

958
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:28,890
Something about the

959
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:28,890
environment you were

960
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:28,890
living in during pregnancy.

961
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:30,050
Your nutrition.

962
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:33,120
Something I ate?

963
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:36,560
Well, more like an

964
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:36,560
insufficient amount

965
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:36,560
of folic acid.

966
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:39,220
That's a nutrient that's found

967
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:39,220
in vitamin B rich foods.

968
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:43,000
How was I supposed to know?

969
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:44,770
Most women don't.

970
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:48,940
They find out

971
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:48,940
from their doctor.

972
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:48,940
I can't believe it.

973
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:53,940
I hurt my baby.

974
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:53,940
No. I promise you, Tionne.

975
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:56,510
I'm so sorry.

976
00:25:58,650 --> 00:25:59,950
Please forgive me.

977
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:13,890
How're you feeling?

978
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,060
I'm fine. I don't see

979
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,060
what the big deal was.

980
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,000
Did you talk to Dr. Bridges?

981
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:24,070
You know, I did. We were

982
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:24,070
able to have a nice

983
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:24,070
long talk this time.

984
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:26,550
And, you know, he told me

985
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:26,550
about your dad.

986
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:30,950
I was so sorry to hear that

987
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:30,950
he passed away last year.

988
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:34,850
What did he say about me?

989
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:37,920
Well, really, we mostly talked

990
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:37,920
about your dad.

991
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:40,020
You know, and how rough

992
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:40,020
that must've been on you.

993
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:42,650
I mean, I know how hard it was

994
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:42,650
on me when my dad died.

995
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:47,060
Yeah.

996
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,340
It was terrible.

997
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:54,730
He...

998
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,940
He was a wonderful man.

999
00:26:57,380 --> 00:27:01,280
Yeah. And, you know,

1000
00:26:57,380 --> 00:27:01,280
Dr. Bridges said that

1001
00:26:57,380 --> 00:27:01,280
he was actually

1002
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,280
the one who tried to save him.

1003
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,020
Right? And that's how

1004
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,020
you met him?

1005
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:12,880
I really don't wanna

1006
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:12,880
talk about this.

1007
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:18,320
Where's my stuff? I wanna

1008
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:18,320
call Dr. Bridges,

1009
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:18,320
let him know I'm okay.

1010
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:21,290
I totally get that it

1011
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:21,290
makes you uncomfortable

1012
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:24,170
to talk about Dr. Bridges and

1013
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:24,170
your dad, really I do...

1014
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:27,210
Okay. Okay. I see where

1015
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:27,210
you're going with this.

1016
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:31,110
My father and Dr. Bridges have

1017
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:31,110
nothing to do with each other.

1018
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:34,980
Dr. Bridges cares for me.

1019
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:38,810
So much so that he

1020
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:38,810
wouldn't even treat me.

1021
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:38,810
You said so yourself.

1022
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:42,620
Well, no, you actually

1023
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:42,620
said that. I just confirmed

1024
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:42,620
that it would have been

1025
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,160
an ethical issue if

1026
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,160
Dr. Bridges

1027
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,160
had feelings for you.

1028
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:49,320
But wait, are you

1029
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:49,320
saying, Ramona,

1030
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:52,630
that you don't feel like

1031
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:52,630
your father cared for you?

1032
00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:56,370
I want to talk to

1033
00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:56,370
Dr. Bridges right now.

1034
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:58,970
Ramona, I'm so sorry. But...

1035
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:01,630
Dr. Bridges doesn't

1036
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:01,630
wanna talk to you.

1037
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:06,110
But you said that he wanted me

1038
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:06,110
to get the care that I need.

1039
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:10,240
He does. Because he's

1040
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:10,240
your doctor. But

1041
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:10,240
that's all that he is.

1042
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:18,260
Ramona, I'm really

1043
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:18,260
worried about you.

1044
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:23,690
And particularly, the

1045
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:23,690
circumstances surrounding

1046
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:23,690
your injuries.

1047
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:27,670
Right? And which is why, I

1048
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:27,670
wanna hold you here at

1049
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:27,670
the hospital for a few days,

1050
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:31,730
because, well, frankly, I'm

1051
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:31,730
concerned that you're a danger

1052
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:31,730
to yourself.

1053
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:35,330
My injuries? You've seen

1054
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:35,330
the nail in my foot.

1055
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,270
You think I put it

1056
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,270
there on purpose?

1057
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:48,680
This is outrageous. Get me

1058
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:48,680
that walker in the corner.

1059
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:51,450
Listen, I can understand why

1060
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:51,450
you're upset, really, I can.

1061
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,190
But there's something

1062
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,190
important going on here.

1063
00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:56,700
And we're gonna have to talk

1064
00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:56,700
about it, sooner or later.

1065
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,430
If you won't get it, I will.

1066
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:00,360
No, Ramona. Ramona,

1067
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:00,360
you need to stay in bed.

1068
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:03,270
Ramona! Ramona!

1069
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:03,270
I will sue you!

1070
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:03,270
I will sue this hospital!

1071
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:04,700
Walter!

1072
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:04,700
You stop!

1073
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:05,800
Walter!

1074
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:05,800
One second.

1075
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:08,770
Ramona. Get back into bed.

1076
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:08,770
No, stop! No.

1077
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,280
Miss?

1078
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,280
Soft restraints, please.

1079
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:13,970
No, let go of me. Let go

1080
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:13,970
of me! You can't do this!

1081
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:13,970
No, let go of me!

1082
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,410
Okay.

1083
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,410
Stop! Please!

1084
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,210
Two of Ativan.

1085
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,210
No!

1086
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:21,320
Hey, Nat.

1087
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:21,320
Hey.

1088
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:23,480
So, you and Crockett?

1089
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:26,420
Dean told you.

1090
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:26,420
Yeah.

1091
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:27,960
All right, look.

1092
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:31,050
He was about to send

1093
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:31,050
a patient home with a

1094
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:31,050
severely infected gallbladder.

1095
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:34,160
Okay? We wouldn't have

1096
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:34,160
known about it, had

1097
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:34,160
I not sent Crockett in.

1098
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:36,170
It was the right thing to do.

1099
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:36,170
Sure.

1100
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:40,000
But being right about the

1101
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:40,000
medicine doesn't excuse

1102
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:40,000
the way you went about things.

1103
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:42,170
Fine. It won't happen again.

1104
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:47,340
And listen, if you and

1105
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:47,340
Crockett are seeing

1106
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:47,340
each other outside of work,

1107
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:50,470
then you'll need to go

1108
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:50,470
to HR and declare

1109
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:50,470
that that's the case.

1110
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:54,020
What? Oh, come on.

1111
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,350
Did you declare your

1112
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,350
relationship with April to HR?

1113
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:58,930
No, we didn't, and we

1114
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:58,930
probably should've.

1115
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:02,090
But, April and I were

1116
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:02,090
never in a position to

1117
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:02,090
double doc anybody.

1118
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,460
But HR? Really, Ethan?

1119
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:08,470
I'm just trying to protect

1120
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:08,470
you and the hospital

1121
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:08,470
from any legal recourse.

1122
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:12,770
Okay? So, please,

1123
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:12,770
take it seriously.

1124
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:16,030
Oh, my God.

1125
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:23,470
Tionne Marie Jefferson?

1126
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:23,470
Perfect, thank you.

1127
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:24,920
You're welcome.

1128
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:24,920
Madeline.

1129
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:26,880
Are you here to see

1130
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:26,880
Tionne Jefferson?

1131
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:29,150
She put in a request

1132
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:29,150
with the charge nurse.

1133
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:31,520
Why? Is she giving

1134
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:31,520
her baby over to DCFS?

1135
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,560
Maggie, you know I can't

1136
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,560
reveal those details.

1137
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:49,000
I am so annoyed with

1138
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:49,000
him right now.

1139
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:49,000
With Ethan or Archer?

1140
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:53,010
Both, I guess.

1141
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:53,010
But, mostly Ethan.

1142
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:57,440
You don't want to go to HR?

1143
00:30:58,550 --> 00:31:00,490
It's a violation

1144
00:30:58,550 --> 00:31:00,490
of our privacy, Crockett.

1145
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:02,490
Yeah, okay. Then forget it.

1146
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:05,350
Well, Ethan's not just

1147
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:05,350
gonna let this go. So...

1148
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:08,360
Right. Okay.

1149
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,530
So we go to HR. No big deal.

1150
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:16,300
Right?

1151
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,100
I mean, unless you have

1152
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,100
reservations.

1153
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:21,500
No.

1154
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:26,970
It's just the whole

1155
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:26,970
going public of it all.

1156
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:30,210
You know, I can just hear what

1157
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:30,210
people are gonna say. It's...

1158
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:33,850
Oh. So that's

1159
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:33,850
what this is about.

1160
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,890
You're worried about

1161
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,890
what other people think?

1162
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:38,980
No.

1163
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:42,590
But you do have reservations.

1164
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:49,000
Okay. Your call, Nat.

1165
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,870
I'm gonna get out

1166
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,870
of these scrubs.

1167
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,980
Ethan.

1168
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:05,610
I checked in with the lab,

1169
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:08,250
saw your patient's bone marrow

1170
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:08,250
samples there for testing,

1171
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:11,450
so, I asked the tech to go

1172
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:11,450
ahead and take a look

1173
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:11,450
at those myeloid cells.

1174
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:14,260
See if your patient

1175
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:14,260
has VEXAS after all.

1176
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:16,060
Hector's not your patient.

1177
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:19,530
But see, I thought you

1178
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:19,530
said that it wasn't

1179
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:19,530
such a big deal

1180
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:21,900
about Manning

1181
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:21,900
and Marcel before, so...

1182
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:24,560
I didn't think it was

1183
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:24,560
an issue that they

1184
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:24,560
were in a relationship.

1185
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:28,070
Not that it's okay to

1186
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:28,070
start running tests

1187
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:28,070
on other doctors' patients.

1188
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:32,310
It's a little hard knowing

1189
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:32,310
which rules to follow when

1190
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:32,310
some of them aren't enforced.

1191
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,010
You're being disingenuous.

1192
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:41,960
You're right. Anyway,

1193
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:41,960
I'm just letting you know,

1194
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:44,120
you might hear something

1195
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:44,120
about this VEXAS.

1196
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:53,260
Dr. Charles. There you are.

1197
00:32:53,370 --> 00:32:55,340
I was just on my

1198
00:32:53,370 --> 00:32:55,340
way to see you.

1199
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:58,500
Ramona. Shouldn't

1200
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:58,500
you be in bed?

1201
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:01,970
I slipped my restraints.

1202
00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:08,980
I really needed to

1203
00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:08,980
talk to you. I have

1204
00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:08,980
a confession to make.

1205
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:12,310
Okay.

1206
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:17,520
You were right. I did shoot

1207
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:17,520
myself with a nail gun to see

1208
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:17,520
Dr. Bridges.

1209
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:19,520
Uh-huh.

1210
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:22,990
There's something

1211
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:22,990
wrong with me.

1212
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:22,990
I know that now.

1213
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:29,470
Well, you know, sometimes

1214
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:29,470
being honest with yourself,

1215
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:29,470
that can be very freeing.

1216
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:35,410
It's just a lot, you know,

1217
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,070
to lose your dad.

1218
00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:45,140
And it's so helpful to find

1219
00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:45,140
people who know

1220
00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:45,140
what that feels like.

1221
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:47,190
Right, like Dr. Bridges?

1222
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:53,760
No. No, I was

1223
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:53,760
talking about you.

1224
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:56,720
I am so lucky to have met you.

1225
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:01,390
You don't need to be

1226
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:01,390
nervous around me.

1227
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:05,190
I am very comfortable

1228
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:05,190
around you.

1229
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:10,600
And I'm pretty sure that

1230
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:10,600
you are going to be the

1231
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:10,600
best doctor I've ever had.

1232
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:16,410
Ms. Davis, there you are.

1233
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:19,110
Hi, Ms. Davis.

1234
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:19,110
You gave us quite a scare.

1235
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:21,650
Let's go back upstairs.

1236
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:21,650
Yeah.

1237
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:25,350
Really good idea for you

1238
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:25,350
to get some rest now,

1239
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:25,350
okay, Ramona?

1240
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:31,220
I will make sure

1241
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:31,220
that I look in on you

1242
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:31,220
tomorrow, okay?

1243
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,160
Good night.

1244
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:37,600
Goodbye, Dr. Charles.

1245
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:41,770
I really can't wait.

1246
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:53,520
Okay. There.

1247
00:34:58,390 --> 00:35:00,160
I saw that DCFS was here.

1248
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:02,180
You thinking about...

1249
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,600
Giving your baby up

1250
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,600
for adoption?

1251
00:35:09,570 --> 00:35:10,760
I don't deserve him.

1252
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:15,530
Tionne, there's no evidence

1253
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:15,530
that you're responsible

1254
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:15,530
for your baby's birth defect.

1255
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,500
But I could've been.

1256
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:22,210
I made so many

1257
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:22,210
mistakes in my life.

1258
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:25,240
What if I mess up again?

1259
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:28,720
What if I can't take

1260
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:28,720
care of him right?

1261
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:31,680
You can. You're not alone.

1262
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:33,380
You got family.

1263
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:39,660
And there's support groups for

1264
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:39,660
new moms in your situation.

1265
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:39,660
I can put you in touch.

1266
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,570
I been planning,

1267
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,570
I can get him what he needs.

1268
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:50,510
But maybe what he really needs

1269
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:50,510
is a better mother.

1270
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,690
I gave my baby

1271
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,690
up for adoption.

1272
00:36:08,290 --> 00:36:09,730
I was 16.

1273
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,770
It seemed like the right thing

1274
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,770
to do at the time.

1275
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:19,300
But there was this voice

1276
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:19,300
in the back of my head that...

1277
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:24,140
That told me not to do it.

1278
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:29,910
And I ignored it.

1279
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,420
And that voice, now,

1280
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,420
is all that I hear.

1281
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:45,630
You love that little boy.

1282
00:36:49,570 --> 00:36:50,760
I can see it.

1283
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:55,300
And I think that's

1284
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:55,300
all that matters.

1285
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:03,340
All I'm saying is that...

1286
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,190
Make sure that whatever

1287
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,190
decision you make,

1288
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:14,680
you don't end up living

1289
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:14,680
a life of regret.

1290
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:34,350
Hey, Dean.

1291
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:39,780
You were right. Genetic

1292
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:39,780
sequencing found that

1293
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:39,780
mutation. It's VEXAS.

1294
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:42,920
Hot damn.

1295
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:42,920
I've already

1296
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:42,920
started treatment.

1297
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:45,360
Just, amazing catch, man.

1298
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:49,620
Thanks. Thank you. And...

1299
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:54,370
Again, sorry for overstepping.

1300
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:54,370
No, no need.

1301
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:55,590
All right.

1302
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:04,410
Maggie. I heard you

1303
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:04,410
came back today.

1304
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,770
Is everything okay?

1305
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,770
It is now.

1306
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:10,780
I'm thinking about

1307
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:10,780
reconnecting with my daughter.

1308
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:14,380
Wow. Is that even

1309
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:14,380
a possibility?

1310
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:15,820
Mm-hmm.

1311
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:18,760
There's a program

1312
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:18,760
affiliated with DCFS that

1313
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:23,490
helps birth parents track down

1314
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:23,490
the children they

1315
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:23,490
put up for adoption.

1316
00:38:24,830 --> 00:38:28,560
I spoke to Madeline Gastern

1317
00:38:24,830 --> 00:38:28,560
and it may take a while,

1318
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:31,900
but I might be able

1319
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:31,900
to make it happen.

1320
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:38,040
Sharon?

1321
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:38,040
Well, that's a big

1322
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:38,040
move to make.

1323
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:40,710
Are you sure about this?

1324
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:46,510
There's a wound in my heart

1325
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:46,510
that won't heal.

1326
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:48,780
And Auggie leaving

1327
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:48,780
has only made it worse.

1328
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,590
I have to do something.

1329
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:54,720
I understand. But it's been

1330
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:54,720
over 20 years.

1331
00:38:54,830 --> 00:38:57,300
That child is a

1332
00:38:54,830 --> 00:38:57,300
grown woman now.

1333
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:59,590
All the more reason to do it.

1334
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:04,070
She and I can finally have

1335
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:04,070
all of our questions answered.

1336
00:39:04,370 --> 00:39:07,930
But, have you considered

1337
00:39:04,370 --> 00:39:07,930
maybe she hasn't been

1338
00:39:04,370 --> 00:39:07,930
asking those questions?

1339
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,870
Look, I'm not saying

1340
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,870
don't do it.

1341
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:14,380
Just be prepared, Maggie.

1342
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,580
She may not want to reconnect.

1343
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,400
Crockett.

1344
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,400
Yup.

1345
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:34,760
Hey. You headed home?

1346
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:34,760
Hey.

1347
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:37,530
Yup.

1348
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:37,530
Here.

1349
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:44,100
A consensual

1350
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:44,100
relationship declaration?

1351
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,340
What, are you, gonna start

1352
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,340
a bonfire or something?

1353
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:53,720
Look. Everything I said

1354
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:53,720
earlier was coming

1355
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:53,720
from a place of fear.

1356
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:57,680
Okay? I don't have

1357
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:57,680
reservations about us.

1358
00:39:58,790 --> 00:40:01,760
And the last thing I wanna do

1359
00:39:58,790 --> 00:40:01,760
is break things off. So...

1360
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:07,030
Hm.

1361
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:11,460
You want to know how I feel?

1362
00:40:11,570 --> 00:40:12,770
Of course.

1363
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:14,860
You got a pen?

1364
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,430
Yes.

1365
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:21,140
Can you turn around?

1366
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:21,140
Okay.

1367
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:34,720
You are too much.

1368
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:38,060
You know, people

1369
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:38,060
are gonna talk.

1370
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:40,690
So let 'em.
