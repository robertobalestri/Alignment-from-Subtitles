1
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:06,360
What are you doing?

2
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:06,360
Scrubbing in.

3
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:09,370
I appreciate your enthusiasm.

4
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:09,370
But you're an ED nurse.

5
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:11,240
You should've gone

6
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:11,240
to med school.

7
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:15,300
I'm reconnecting

8
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:15,300
with my daughter.

9
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:15,300
It's been over 20 years.

10
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,010
Are you sure about this?

11
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:19,710
Dr. Manning's mother

12
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:19,710
is in heart failure.

13
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,240
Our drug

14
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,240
could save her life.

15
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:22,680
There's no guarantee...

16
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:22,680
The drug works.

17
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:24,050
I unblinded a patient.

18
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:25,590
You've jeopardized

19
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:25,590
both of our jobs.

20
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:28,050
I'm not making

21
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:28,050
any exceptions

22
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:28,050
to the enrollment.

23
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,180
I found these trial meds.

24
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,180
Yep, those have to

25
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,180
go back to Kender.

26
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,660
I want you

27
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,660
to take these.

28
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,660
New meds?

29
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:36,990
They're from

30
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:36,990
a different doctor.

31
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,260
Mom? What are you

32
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,260
doing up so early?

33
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:47,500
Oh, I'm sorry.

34
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:47,500
I couldn't sleep.

35
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,670
My throat is dry.

36
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:52,610
Hmm. You've been

37
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:52,610
having that cough

38
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:52,610
for a while, now, huh?

39
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:54,240
Yeah.

40
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:54,240
Is anything else

41
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:54,240
bothering you?

42
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:58,640
No. But come

43
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:58,640
to think of it,

44
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:05,380
my cough began around the time

45
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:05,380
that I started taking these.

46
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:09,060
Who prescribed them,

47
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:09,060
anyway?

48
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:13,800
Is this the medication

49
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:13,800
that Will was suggesting?

50
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,590
No, Mom. Remember?

51
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,590
The trial closed.

52
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:20,740
Right. So, then,

53
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:20,740
what do they do?

54
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:24,670
They improve

55
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:24,670
your injection fraction.

56
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:24,670
They help your heart pump.

57
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,720
Oh.

58
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:32,690
Work?

59
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:32,690
Yeah. I gotta get going.

60
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:35,550
Okay.

61
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:35,550
But I will check

62
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:35,550
on you later, okay?

63
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:37,420
Very good. Mwah.

64
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:37,420
All right, love you. Mwah.

65
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:39,750
Sabeena.

66
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:42,390
Good morning.

67
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:42,390
Hi.

68
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:45,430
You're here early.

69
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,670
So, um...

70
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:54,800
Now, that I'm in front of you,

71
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:54,800
I realize I haven't rehearsed

72
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:54,800
my speech.

73
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:58,840
Anyway, I just wanted to say

74
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:58,840
again how sorry I am

75
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:01,710
for violating your trust.

76
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:05,310
I'm not gonna sugarcoat it.

77
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:05,310
I was wrong. No excuse.

78
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:07,450
Apology accepted.

79
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:07,450
Great.

80
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:11,330
And you know, if you're

81
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:11,330
free later, maybe a drink?

82
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:12,820
I'm sorry, Will.

83
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:15,150
While I want us

84
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:15,150
to still be friends,

85
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,600
I think it's best

86
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,600
we keep things professional

87
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,600
moving forward.

88
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:20,790
Oh. Okay. Yeah.

89
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:31,110
How'd you wrangle that

90
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:31,110
thing away from Maggie?

91
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:32,200
She's repping Gaffney

92
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:33,610
at some residency fair

93
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:33,610
this morning.

94
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,450
All that power

95
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,450
at your fingertips.

96
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,450
How's it feel?

97
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:37,680
Surprisingly natural.

98
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:38,880
Like I was born

99
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:38,880
to boss people around.

100
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,760
Oh. Hey, you're up,

101
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,760
Dr. Choi.

102
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,630
Car struck a kid

103
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,630
on his bicycle.

104
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:45,630
Driver and victim incoming.

105
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:47,130
Driskell, with me!

106
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:52,640
10-year-old male,

107
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:52,640
struck by a motor vehicle

108
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:52,640
at 35 miles per hour.

109
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:55,200
No helmet.

110
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:55,200
GCS four in the field.

111
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,240
Intubated in the ambo.

112
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,440
What about the driver?

113
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,440
Right behind us.

114
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:00,560
Dr. Choi?

115
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:00,560
Yeah?

116
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:02,510
There's something

117
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:02,510
you should know.

118
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:02,510
What is it?

119
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:03,810
Ms. Goodwin is the driver.

120
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:06,340
Get him transferred.

121
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:06,340
I'll be right back.

122
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:06,340
You got it.

123
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,780
Ms. Goodwin!

124
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:10,180
Dr. Choi, the boy...

125
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:13,220
Okay. I'm about to check

126
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:13,220
him out. Are you okay?

127
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:13,220
Are you okay?

128
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,480
It was so dark.

129
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:16,920
And he just came

130
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:16,920
out of nowhere.

131
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:19,320
There was no time

132
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:19,320
to stop.

133
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:19,320
It's okay.

134
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:22,660
So, I held his c-spine

135
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:22,660
until the medics got there.

136
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,230
But he wasn't moving.

137
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:28,430
And there was

138
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:28,430
so much blood.

139
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:28,430
I'll do everything I can.

140
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:31,740
Please... Oh, God.

141
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,220
This is gonna

142
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,220
sting a little.

143
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,220
Okay.

144
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,380
Any tenderness?

145
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:46,920
Yeah, it looks like

146
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:46,920
the seat belt

147
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:46,920
got you pretty good.

148
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,420
Yeah, I skidded

149
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,420
and hit a telephone pole.

150
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,860
The airbag caught

151
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,860
most of my impact, but...

152
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:57,360
Uh, I feel fine. Really.

153
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:57,360
No dizziness, no neck pain.

154
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,330
Good.

155
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,330
You all right?

156
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:01,400
Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.

157
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,370
Ms. Goodwin, I think

158
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,370
we need to get a chest X-ray,

159
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,370
a 12-lead EKG,

160
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:06,240
just to rule out

161
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:06,240
any blunt cardiac injury.

162
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,470
Okay, but later, please.

163
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:09,910
Could you

164
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:09,910
give us a moment?

165
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:11,210
Sure.

166
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:12,870
Thank you.

167
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:12,870
Of course.

168
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:19,250
I was headed

169
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:19,250
to meet my trainer.

170
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:22,950
Going under the speed limit,

171
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:22,950
no distractions.

172
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:25,850
I didn't even have

173
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:25,850
the radio on.

174
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:31,300
I don't know

175
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:31,300
where he came from. My side?

176
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,660
There was no way

177
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,660
I could have seen him.

178
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:35,400
Sharon, it was

179
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:35,400
an accident.

180
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,500
And it doesn't sound like

181
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,500
you did anything wrong.

182
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:40,540
Oh, Daniel, he couldn't have

183
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:40,540
been more than 10 or 11.

184
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:43,010
And he was out, biking alone?

185
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:43,010
I mean, in the dark?

186
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:45,580
And no helmet.

187
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,280
Do you know anything?

188
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,280
Any word on how he's doing?

189
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:51,320
I don't. I just came

190
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:51,320
straight down here

191
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:51,320
as soon as I heard.

192
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:55,020
Bert's on his way in.

193
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:55,020
Bert? Who called him?

194
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:57,720
I guess he's still your

195
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:57,720
emergency contact?

196
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,950
I thought you guys

197
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,950
were on good terms.

198
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,830
I don't wanna talk

199
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,830
about that right now.

200
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:03,400
Do you want me to

201
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:03,400
try and hold him off?

202
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,300
No, it's fine,

203
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,300
it's just,

204
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:09,460
please, I need you

205
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:09,460
to find out what's

206
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:09,460
going on with that boy.

207
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:14,010
And no HIPAA nonsense

208
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:14,010
right now.

209
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,470
I may have just...

210
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:19,040
Ms. Goodwin,

211
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:19,040
this a good time to take

212
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:19,040
your statement?

213
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:21,340
Shouldn't take long.

214
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:21,340
Traffic cams clearly show

215
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:21,340
you were not at fault.

216
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,280
Okay. Daniel, please?

217
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:28,380
I'll be back. All right?

218
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:30,050
All right. Okay.

219
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:30,050
Hang in there.

220
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:36,420
I tried to

221
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:36,420
call you this morning.

222
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,930
Yeah, um, I'm sorry.

223
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,930
I was in the shower,

224
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:40,970
and I've just been running

225
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:40,970
a little bit late today.

226
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:42,660
Yeah. Did you hear

227
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:42,660
about Goodwin?

228
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:45,500
No. What happened?

229
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:45,500
She was in

230
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:45,500
a car accident.

231
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:46,910
What? Is she okay?

232
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:48,700
Yeah, thankfully.

233
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:48,700
No serious injuries.

234
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:50,040
Oh, thank God.

235
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,810
But hey, I was calling

236
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:53,810
because I was doing

237
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:53,810
some research on AICDs.

238
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,710
I know you and your mom

239
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,710
have some reservations

240
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:56,880
about going that route.

241
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:57,980
Yeah.

242
00:05:58,090 --> 00:05:59,320
There's some

243
00:05:58,090 --> 00:05:59,320
preliminary evidence

244
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:00,950
that supplementing

245
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:00,950
the device with Digoxin

246
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,850
can lower the incidence

247
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,850
of arrhythmia.

248
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,980
Not a total fix,

249
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,980
but certainly can make things

250
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:06,080
more comfortable for Carol.

251
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:09,990
Thank you for

252
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:09,990
looking into that.

253
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,660
It sounds promising.

254
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:12,990
I sent you the literature,

255
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,400
in case you wanna

256
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,400
browse it yourself.

257
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:18,640
I will definitely look at it,

258
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:18,640
but I am late for work, so...

259
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:20,940
Of course. Bye.

260
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:20,940
Bye.

261
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,680
Excuse me, Miss? Uh...

262
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,680
Yeah?

263
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,080
I'm a nurse

264
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,080
from Chicago Med,

265
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:33,580
and I'm here for

266
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:33,580
the residency fair

267
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:34,820
and I'm a bit lost.

268
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,590
I'm looking

269
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,590
for Beecher Hall.

270
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:40,460
Oh, sure. At the end

271
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:40,460
of this hall,

272
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:40,460
you're gonna take a left,

273
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,860
then go through your first

274
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,860
doorway on your right.

275
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,870
After that, you're gonna

276
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,870
see a stairwell, and...

277
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,630
You know what,

278
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,630
why don't I just take you?

279
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:50,600
That would be great.

280
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:50,600
Thank you.

281
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:54,810
Okay. Here.

282
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,410
Oh.

283
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:57,880
A small token

284
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:57,880
of my appreciation.

285
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:00,540
Oh, wow.

286
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:00,540
You're hooking me up!

287
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:02,850
Don't you need these

288
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:02,850
to entice applicants

289
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:02,850
for your, um...

290
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,410
What's it called again?

291
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,540
Audition rotation.

292
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,540
Mmm.

293
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:08,590
Essentially, a mini

294
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:08,590
two-to-four-week tryout

295
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:09,710
for your top program.

296
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,120
I had the most

297
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,120
terrifying flashback

298
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,420
when you said "audition."

299
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:13,620
Oh, no, what happened?

300
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:14,720
Fifth grade.

301
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:15,820
Tried out

302
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:15,820
for the school musical.

303
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:17,130
They were doing The Wiz

304
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:17,130
and I froze.

305
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,490
Poor guy playing the piano,

306
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,130
he had to start my song

307
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,130
over three times.

308
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,430
You're kidding. The Wiz?

309
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:22,730
Yeah. What?

310
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,000
It's just, when I was

311
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,000
in middle school,

312
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,100
I was in The Wizard of Oz

313
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:26,700
and I played the Scarecrow.

314
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:28,800
Oh. Okay,

315
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:28,800
you must have had chops.

316
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:31,470
I was just one of the poppies

317
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:31,470
and that's tough to screw up.

318
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,710
Hey, miss. Thank you

319
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,710
so much for going

320
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,710
out of your way.

321
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:37,050
No problem. It was nice

322
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:37,050
to meet you. Wait, I'm sorry.

323
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:37,050
I didn't get your name.

324
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:39,520
Oh, I'm Maggie.

325
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:39,520
Maggie. I'm Vanessa.

326
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:42,720
I have to get to my lab,

327
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:42,720
but take care.

328
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:57,170
I didn't even

329
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:57,170
want to come in,

330
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:57,170
but my boss forced me.

331
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:59,870
Besides the abdominal pain,

332
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:59,870
any vomiting?

333
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:03,040
No, nothing. I'm also

334
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:03,040
about to start my period.

335
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,100
Maybe this is just bad PMS?

336
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:08,150
I don't think so.

337
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:08,150
Your abdomen sounds like

338
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:08,150
a hollow drum.

339
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:09,980
It means there's air

340
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:09,980
trapped in your bowel.

341
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:11,450
I'm thinking you might

342
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:11,450
be obstructed.

343
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:14,190
I so don't have time for this.

344
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:14,190
I just got my first huge case.

345
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:17,520
Can we wrap this up

346
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:17,520
in under eight hours?

347
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:18,990
It's hard to say, really.

348
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:21,960
Yeah, we need to get

349
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:21,960
an abdominal X-ray

350
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:21,960
and some bloodwork,

351
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:23,190
then we'll take it

352
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:23,190
from there.

353
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,090
Come on. There must be a way

354
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,090
to fast-track things.

355
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:27,100
I promise, we'll move

356
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:27,100
as quickly as we can.

357
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:29,830
Thanks.

358
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:33,630
She's gonna be a fun one.

359
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,940
No way to schedule

360
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,940
sickness, unfortunately.

361
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:39,910
Um... Hey.

362
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:39,910
I wanted to, uh, ask you.

363
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,480
Yeah.

364
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,480
Your trial medications,

365
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,050
is dry cough

366
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,050
one of the side effects?

367
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:47,680
It is. Yeah, we've seen it

368
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:47,680
in several participants. Why?

369
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:52,490
Oh, I just... I saw one

370
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:52,490
of your trial patients

371
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:52,490
in the ED the other day.

372
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:53,990
Really? Huh.

373
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,620
Usually,

374
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,620
I'd get a notification

375
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:57,720
if one of our participants

376
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:57,720
ends up in the ED.

377
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:00,670
No, no. It was nothing.

378
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:00,670
It just ended up

379
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:00,670
being indigestion,

380
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:03,570
but that was one

381
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:03,570
of the symptoms

382
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:03,570
that was an outlier,

383
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:05,110
so, I just wanted

384
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:05,110
to make sure.

385
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,840
Oh, okay, yeah. Usually

386
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,840
resolves within a few days.

387
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:10,910
Oh. Great.

388
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:10,910
Hey, hang on.

389
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:14,240
How's your mom doing?

390
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:19,650
I was gonna come around

391
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:19,650
the other day when

392
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:19,650
she was here for her exam,

393
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:22,120
but I thought there

394
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:22,120
might be too many cooks

395
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:22,120
in the kitchen.

396
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:27,090
I get it. Um, Mom is...

397
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:27,090
She's hanging in there.

398
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,990
Still having palpitations,

399
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,990
though, but...

400
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,530
You know this isn't

401
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,530
your fault, right?

402
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:35,730
That it turned out this way?

403
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:35,730
Thank you for

404
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:35,730
saying that, Will.

405
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,570
I'm serious.

406
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,570
And you need anything,

407
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:42,710
ask.

408
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:42,710
Thank you.

409
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:54,290
Is there anything

410
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:54,290
I can do for you?

411
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:54,290
Calls I can make?

412
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:56,990
No. Insurance

413
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:56,990
has been informed.

414
00:09:57,090 --> 00:10:00,890
It's just, the boy...

415
00:09:57,090 --> 00:10:00,890
You know what's going on?

416
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,590
Only that he's

417
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,590
getting scans upstairs.

418
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,590
I'm sorry.

419
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,170
Is Bert here?

420
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,170
I thought I saw him come in.

421
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:08,240
Yeah, he's grabbing

422
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:08,240
a coffee.

423
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,300
Everything been okay

424
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,300
with both of you

425
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,970
since you told him

426
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,970
that you only wanted

427
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,970
a friendship?

428
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:15,940
All right, well...

429
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,240
Oh. There he is now.

430
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:21,910
I gotta get back to work,

431
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:21,910
but is there something

432
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:21,910
I can get for you?

433
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:24,750
Yeah. Actually,

434
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:24,750
there is one thing.

435
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:26,980
I keep a dress

436
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:26,980
in my office closet.

437
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:28,780
I'll get it.

438
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:28,780
And my shoes.

439
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:31,290
I'll grab that, too.

440
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:31,290
Good morning.

441
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:31,290
Morning.

442
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:33,950
No, thank you.

443
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:35,920
What did Michael say?

444
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:35,920
He on his way?

445
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:37,830
I decided against

446
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:37,830
calling him.

447
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:40,330
I know you don't wanna

448
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:40,330
burden him, but he'd

449
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:40,330
wanna be here for you.

450
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,660
I'll put him in the loop

451
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,660
when I get more info.

452
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:46,000
Where is Daniel

453
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:46,000
with the update?

454
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:48,630
Why don't you have

455
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:48,630
a seat for now, try to rest?

456
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:50,870
I wonder if the boy's mother

457
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:50,870
is here yet.

458
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:53,140
Listen, I know

459
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:53,140
you want answers,

460
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,110
but you can't be caught

461
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,110
snooping around.

462
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:56,280
If this turns into a lawsuit,

463
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:59,880
the last thing you wanna do

464
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:59,880
is make yourself look guilty.

465
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:01,960
Matter of fact,

466
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:01,960
let me take you home.

467
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:04,650
We can wait

468
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:04,650
for news there.

469
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:04,650
No.

470
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,190
I'm not going anywhere.

471
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,330
Sharon...

472
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:16,030
Look, I need to make sure

473
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:16,030
that that boy is all right.

474
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:18,700
Bert, I don't need

475
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:18,700
any babysitting.

476
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:20,740
Please, just go.

477
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:32,350
Were you able

478
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:32,350
to find anything out?

479
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:34,220
Name's Jake Miller.

480
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:34,220
Okay.

481
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,850
Okay? He's 10 years old.

482
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,850
His mom is on the way in.

483
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:39,760
Okay, and what

484
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:39,760
about his injuries?

485
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:44,060
He suffered

486
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:44,060
multiple fractures,

487
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:44,060
and unfortunately,

488
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,970
uh, a traumatic pseudoaneurysm

489
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,970
in his brain.

490
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:49,060
Oh.

491
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:52,700
Also wanted you to know that,

492
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:52,700
as of a few minutes ago,

493
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:52,700
anyway,

494
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:54,170
they had yet

495
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:54,170
to stabilize him.

496
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:57,870
No.

497
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:05,180
No, no. That's right.

498
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:05,180
A small white box.

499
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:10,220
Well, listen, I'm sorry.

500
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:11,920
I'm not sure

501
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:11,920
what happened then.

502
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:13,050
Um...

503
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,460
Let me look into it,

504
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,460
and I'll circle back

505
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,460
with you.

506
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,890
Okay, thanks.

507
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:21,170
Hey. Is everything okay?

508
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:22,260
Yeah.

509
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,800
No, actually.

510
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:27,970
Remember my clinical trial

511
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:27,970
patient, Mr. Brady?

512
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:31,910
His remaining allotment

513
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:31,910
of medication was supposed

514
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:31,910
to be sent back to Kender.

515
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:33,310
But that was

516
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:33,310
the pharmacist.

517
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:36,980
She said the courier

518
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:36,980
claims someone

519
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:36,980
picked them up already.

520
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:40,890
Oh. I'm sorry. I mean,

521
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:40,890
is it even that big

522
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:40,890
of a deal, though?

523
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,150
Yeah, the pills

524
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,150
were my responsibility.

525
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:46,850
I'm gonna have to find them,

526
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:46,850
one way or another.

527
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,190
Uh, I'll catch you later.

528
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:59,400
Oh, God. Jake, no.

529
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:01,310
Jake, what's wrong?

530
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:01,310
Sam, honey, don't touch.

531
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:03,310
You must be Jake's mom.

532
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:03,310
I'm Dr. Choi.

533
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:06,510
Is he gonna be okay?

534
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:06,510
Why is Jake sleeping?

535
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:08,870
Shh. Honey, I gotta

536
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:08,870
talk to the doctor.

537
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:11,780
We have a daycare center

538
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:11,780
at the hospital.

539
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:11,780
Plenty of snacks and toys.

540
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:14,050
I'd be happy

541
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:14,050
to take him.

542
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:14,050
Thank you.

543
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:17,050
Sam, go with this nice lady,

544
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:17,050
I'll come see you in a bit.

545
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,230
Ms. Miller...

546
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:28,860
I'm sorry, but Jake

547
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:28,860
suffered what we call

548
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:28,860
a pseudoaneurysm.

549
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,170
The impact from the crash

550
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,170
tore a vessel in his brain

551
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,300
that has already leaked.

552
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:35,410
In his brain? Oh, my God.

553
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:37,780
Now, the pressure

554
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:37,780
is holding it closed.

555
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,510
But it could open up,

556
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,510
so, we need to get control.

557
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:41,450
How do you do that?

558
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:44,210
There are a couple

559
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:44,210
treatment options

560
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:44,210
I wanna discuss with you.

561
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,820
But if you need

562
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,820
a moment...

563
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,820
Who hit him?

564
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:51,790
Bet they were drinking.

565
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:58,060
I swear, whoever did this,

566
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:00,020
they're gonna pay.

567
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:09,210
Sorry.

568
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:10,800
Are you going

569
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:10,800
back to school?

570
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:13,870
Oh. I'm applying.

571
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:13,870
Hmm.

572
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:15,880
Some nurse

573
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:15,880
practitioner programs,

574
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,420
get certified.

575
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,420
Yeah. Got a top choice?

576
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:22,990
I did. Porter.

577
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:22,990
But unfortunately,

578
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:22,990
I missed the deadline.

579
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:27,460
Porter... Is Melinda Baker

580
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:27,460
still the head

581
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:27,460
of the nursing school there?

582
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:29,900
I think so, yeah.

583
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:29,900
You know her?

584
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:32,460
She married my cousin,

585
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:35,590
and then she divorced

586
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:35,590
my cousin, but we're

587
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:35,590
still on good terms.

588
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,270
I could make

589
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,270
a phone call,

590
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:42,370
and if I sing your praises,

591
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:42,370
I bet she'd make

592
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:42,370
an exception.

593
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,840
That's really nice

594
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,840
of you. Um...

595
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:47,970
Dr. Archer, April,

596
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:47,970
you have a patient

597
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:47,970
in Treatment Four.

598
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,280
I'm sending you

599
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,280
the chart right now.

600
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:52,380
Ah. Thanks. After you.

601
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:52,380
Okay.

602
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,360
Mr. Turner,

603
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,360
you're having trouble peeing?

604
00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:00,020
I haven't relieved myself

605
00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:00,020
in two days. It's killing me.

606
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:01,600
I'm sorry.

607
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,460
It's been going on

608
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,460
for months now.

609
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,860
Every few weeks,

610
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,860
I have to come back in

611
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,860
and get...

612
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:10,270
Okay. Have you

613
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:10,270
seen a urologist?

614
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:10,270
No, not yet.

615
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:13,430
There's no appointments.

616
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:13,430
I guess, there's a big backlog

617
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:13,430
due to COVID.

618
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:16,340
Okay. I'm gonna

619
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:16,340
refer you to somebody

620
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:16,340
here at Gaffney.

621
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,540
In the meantime,

622
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,540
let's give Flomax

623
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,540
and put in a Foley.

624
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:21,580
It's a type

625
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:21,580
of catheter.

626
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:21,580
I know.

627
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:26,280
I'm so sick of this.

628
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:29,890
Would you excuse me

629
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:29,890
for a minute?

630
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:29,890
I'll be right back.

631
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,230
Hey, Dr. Archer?

632
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,230
Yeah.

633
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:43,240
I was just thinking,

634
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:43,240
Mr. Turner's had

635
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:43,240
multiple Foleys,

636
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:44,970
and they're not

637
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:44,970
resolving the problem.

638
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:47,230
Mmm-hmm. You have

639
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:47,230
a better idea?

640
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:50,140
What about

641
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:50,140
a suprapubic tube?

642
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,210
It could give him

643
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,210
long-term relief,

644
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:54,580
there's a lot lower

645
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:54,580
incidence of infection

646
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:57,020
and stricture, right?

647
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:57,020
Yeah.

648
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:57,020
That's a good thought.

649
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,150
But an SP tube is

650
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,150
an involved procedure,

651
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,150
and the ED's hopping, so...

652
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,150
He's in

653
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,150
so much pain, though.

654
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:03,490
Still,

655
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:03,490
it's not emergent.

656
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:06,190
So, get a med student

657
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:06,190
to put in a Foley,

658
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:08,460
and discharge him

659
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:08,460
with GU follow-up.

660
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,930
Okay.

661
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:16,530
Hey.

662
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:20,300
Ms. Watkins' test results?

663
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:20,300
Yep. Her labs

664
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:20,300
and X-rays.

665
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:22,140
Thanks.

666
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:22,140
You were right,

667
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:22,140
bowel obstruction.

668
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:24,640
Ah. I'm thinking an NG tube.

669
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,480
Suck and drip,

670
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,480
it'll likely resolve

671
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,480
on its own.

672
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:28,240
Yeah, but I still want

673
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:28,240
a surgical consult.

674
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:31,080
Really?

675
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:31,080
Feels early for that.

676
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:34,090
Her scans and X-rays

677
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:34,090
show a good amount

678
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:34,090
of air in the colon.

679
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:36,680
I mean, something's

680
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:36,680
getting through. It might

681
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:36,680
only be a partial obstruction.

682
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:39,120
And Surgery may agree,

683
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:39,120
but better safe

684
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:39,120
than sorry, right?

685
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,090
Don't want to risk

686
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,090
her bowel distending

687
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,090
too much

688
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,460
and outstripping

689
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,460
the blood supply.

690
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,960
All right.

691
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:48,100
Hey, you mind paging Surgery?

692
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:48,100
I gotta swing by

693
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:48,100
the security office.

694
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,160
How come?

695
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:52,670
I wanna see

696
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:52,670
if they can pull footage

697
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:52,670
from last week.

698
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:54,410
Pills still haven't

699
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:54,410
shown up.

700
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:57,210
I'm just guessing

701
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:57,210
someone grabbed them

702
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:57,210
by mistake.

703
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:58,440
Is that really necessary?

704
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,340
It seems like

705
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,340
a lot to go through

706
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,340
for some medication

707
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:02,140
that'll probably just

708
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:02,140
get tossed out anyways.

709
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,310
Kender, they're gonna

710
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,310
want them accounted for.

711
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:08,220
Plus, I'm not exactly

712
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:08,220
on Dr. Virani's

713
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:08,220
good side right now.

714
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:10,360
What do you mean?

715
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:10,360
You're her star PI.

716
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:15,190
Yeah, well...

717
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:15,190
It's nothing,

718
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:15,190
forget I said anything.

719
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,530
You said your door

720
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,530
was always open.

721
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:28,370
And as you can see,

722
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:28,370
I ain't no fibber.

723
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:28,370
Come on in.

724
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:35,620
I was gonna talk to Sharon,

725
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:35,620
but given everything

726
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:35,620
that happened...

727
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:39,120
Oh, yeah, of course.

728
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:39,120
What's on your mind?

729
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:42,780
Um, I don't know where

730
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:42,780
to start, or how to start.

731
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:47,590
Don't overthink it, Mags.

732
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:47,590
Just tell me

733
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:47,590
what's going on.

734
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:52,430
Okay. I have a daughter.

735
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:54,290
Her name is Vanessa.

736
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,770
And this morning,

737
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,770
for the first time,

738
00:17:58,510 --> 00:17:59,800
I met her.

739
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,430
Huh.

740
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,080
I'm just so sorry you had

741
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,080
to go through that.

742
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:15,750
I cannot even imagine

743
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:15,750
how difficult

744
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:15,750
that must have been.

745
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:18,220
Having a kid at 16.

746
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:18,220
Having to give her up.

747
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,350
It was devastating.

748
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:23,690
And now, you know,

749
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:23,690
giving Auggie up.

750
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:25,530
Yeah.

751
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:27,430
I guess it triggered

752
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:27,430
all these feelings.

753
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:31,100
Oh.

754
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:31,100
I mean, suddenly,

755
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:31,100
this need to know

756
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:33,400
who she was,

757
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:33,400
that she was okay, just...

758
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:35,480
It took over.

759
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:35,480
I just was...

760
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:39,250
I was just gonna

761
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:39,250
open the envelope,

762
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:42,340
find out her name,

763
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:42,340
and then look her up

764
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:42,340
on the Internet.

765
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:44,580
Right. But then?

766
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:50,160
But then I found out

767
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:50,160
that she was still

768
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:50,160
living in Chicago,

769
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:54,520
and she was in

770
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:54,520
medical school and

771
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:54,520
in the same field as me.

772
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:55,760
What are the odds?

773
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:59,320
You know, a lot of us

774
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:59,320
just go around and around

775
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:01,160
on the nature-versus-nurture

776
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:01,160
debate.

777
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:05,430
But it is amazing

778
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:05,430
how many of our behaviors,

779
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:08,130
our preferences

780
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:08,130
appear to be genetic.

781
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,210
It felt that everything

782
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,210
in the universe was

783
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,210
leading me to meet her.

784
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:14,770
I totally get how

785
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:14,770
it would feel that way.

786
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:14,770
I do.

787
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:19,340
I'm not trying to disrupt

788
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:19,340
her life. I swear.

789
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:19,340
I just had to see her.

790
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:25,390
And now, that I have,

791
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:25,390
I'm good.

792
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:25,390
Huh.

793
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:28,700
So, you don't intend

794
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:28,700
to see her again?

795
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,320
Of course I want to,

796
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,270
but I won't. She's safe,

797
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,270
she's thriving.

798
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:40,440
I got what I needed.

799
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,870
Hold on. Where'd you

800
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,870
get that information?

801
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:49,150
Never mind that.

802
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:52,380
Just what is

803
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:52,380
the treatment plan

804
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:52,380
for Jake's pseudoaneurysm?

805
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:55,290
All due respect,

806
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:55,290
you know I can't

807
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:55,290
disclose that.

808
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:57,550
Dr. Choi...

809
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:57,550
Ms. Goodwin, please.

810
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,890
HIPAA aside,

811
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,890
it's a conflict

812
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,890
of interest.

813
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:01,890
Considering your involvement,

814
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:01,890
this could look really bad.

815
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,260
Any lawyer

816
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,260
would advise...

817
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:07,530
Let me worry

818
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:07,530
about that! Please.

819
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:12,900
The vessel's still leaking,

820
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:17,440
so, Neurosurgery

821
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:17,440
is gonna operate.

822
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:17,440
A craniotomy.

823
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:18,540
Will he make it through that?

824
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:20,840
There is a significant

825
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:20,840
mortality risk.

826
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,340
There must be

827
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,340
a less invasive option.

828
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:25,720
There is,

829
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:25,720
a stent-assisted coil.

830
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:29,950
But due to the extent

831
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:29,950
of the injury,

832
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:32,890
it comes with a high risk

833
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:32,890
of long-term

834
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:32,890
cognitive deficits.

835
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:39,220
Still, we should err

836
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:39,220
on the side of life.

837
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:40,390
I agree with you.

838
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:44,240
But I presented both options

839
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:44,240
to Jake's mother, Wendy,

840
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,600
and she chose surgery.

841
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:48,340
Why? Why would

842
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:48,340
she do that?

843
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,500
She's low-income.

844
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:51,370
She doesn't feel

845
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:51,370
equipped to care

846
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,880
for a child

847
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,880
with extensive needs.

848
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:55,280
Says she can barely

849
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:55,280
keep food on the table

850
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:55,280
as it is.

851
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:56,910
You have to go back to her.

852
00:20:57,020 --> 00:21:00,850
Ms. Goodwin, I know

853
00:20:57,020 --> 00:21:00,850
you have Jake's

854
00:20:57,020 --> 00:21:00,850
best interest at heart.

855
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:05,420
But this decision

856
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:05,420
didn't come easy

857
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:05,420
for his mother.

858
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,860
And I'm not gonna

859
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,860
push it further.

860
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:15,460
Surgery?

861
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:15,460
You gotta be kidding me.

862
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:17,370
I got a deposition

863
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:17,370
tomorrow morning.

864
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:18,940
Elaine, it's just

865
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:18,940
a surgical consult.

866
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:20,710
Doesn't mean

867
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:20,710
they'll recommend

868
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:20,710
an operation.

869
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:22,540
Honestly, your CT

870
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:22,540
looked okay to me.

871
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:24,610
We'll see what...

872
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:24,610
Ms. Watkins,

873
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:24,610
I'm Dr. Marcel.

874
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:25,810
I'm the surgeon

875
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:25,810
reviewing your case.

876
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:27,350
Let's have it.

877
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:27,350
I got work to do.

878
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:31,250
Right.

879
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:31,250
Cutting to the chase,

880
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:33,480
given that conservative

881
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:33,480
management with the NG tube

882
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:35,490
has failed to clear

883
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:35,490
the obstruction,

884
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:37,650
I'd recommend surgery

885
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:37,650
to remove the adhesions.

886
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,280
But let's be clear,

887
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,620
this is in no way

888
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,620
a mandatory operation.

889
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:44,390
I'm sorry, Dr. Halstead,

890
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:44,390
that's not my take on it.

891
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,740
Look. Your white count

892
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,740
is elevated,

893
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,740
you're running a fever.

894
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:48,830
Both of which are concerning.

895
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:52,800
Yes, they are. But still,

896
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:52,800
we haven't given the NG tube

897
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:52,800
much time to work.

898
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:55,710
But if we wait too long,

899
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:55,710
you run the risk

900
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:55,710
of perforation,

901
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:57,870
and then

902
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:57,870
a semi-elective surgery

903
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:57,870
becomes an emergent one.

904
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:00,380
Which is precisely

905
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:00,380
why we would

906
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:00,380
monitor you closely...

907
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,510
You two clearly

908
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,510
can't agree on anything.

909
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,510
So, let me solve this for you.

910
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:04,980
If I'm not dying tomorrow,

911
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:07,050
I'm not doing

912
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:07,050
the surgery. Done.

913
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,510
Great.

914
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:09,650
Right.

915
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:15,630
Hey, you got an issue

916
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:15,630
with me, you don't bring it

917
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:15,630
into the medicine.

918
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,630
Get over yourself.

919
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,630
This is my patient.

920
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:18,760
I had a difference

921
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:18,760
of opinion.

922
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:21,530
Then you pull me aside.

923
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:21,530
You don't openly

924
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:21,530
contradict me.

925
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,760
Seems like a bad habit

926
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,760
of yours lately,

927
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,760
inserting yourself.

928
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:25,530
You are one to talk.

929
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:27,700
Excuse me?

930
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,810
Oh, no. Come on.

931
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,810
Say it.

932
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:33,910
All right, you wanna

933
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:33,910
get into this now? Fine.

934
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:35,480
Carol chose the trial.

935
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:37,050
It's what she wanted.

936
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:37,050
There it is.

937
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:39,010
Everything was a go

938
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:39,010
until you stuck

939
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:39,010
your nose in.

940
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,950
Your memory must be

941
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,950
failing you, 'cause

942
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,950
I didn't force anything.

943
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,580
Natalie was fully

944
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,580
on board with the LVAD.

945
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,390
Because you got

946
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,390
in her head

947
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,390
when she was vulnerable.

948
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:47,590
She chose the LVAD

949
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:47,590
because it was the right

950
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:47,590
medical decision.

951
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:50,390
You think she still

952
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:50,390
feels that way?

953
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:58,070
Hey, Dean. I see

954
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:58,070
you've been clocking

955
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:58,070
quite a few 16-hour shifts.

956
00:22:58,370 --> 00:22:59,600
Weren't you the one

957
00:22:58,370 --> 00:22:59,600
lecturing me

958
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:00,940
about keeping

959
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:00,940
the troops fresh?

960
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,370
Do as I say, not as I do.

961
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:06,500
I just don't want

962
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:06,500
the ED to impede

963
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:06,500
your personal life.

964
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:08,080
Personal life?

965
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:08,080
What the hell is that?

966
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:11,410
Come on. I remember you

967
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:11,410
being a man of many interests

968
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:11,410
back in the day.

969
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,510
Life of the party, too.

970
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:15,560
All right, listen,

971
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:15,560
if you need cash,

972
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:15,560
all you have to do is ask me.

973
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,520
You don't have

974
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,520
to use flattery.

975
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,990
Seriously, though,

976
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,990
no man's an island.

977
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,620
I guess I'm one

978
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,620
of the lucky few.

979
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:25,430
Just don't work yourself

980
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:25,430
into the ground, okay?

981
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:28,020
Lean on your colleagues.

982
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:28,020
We've all got

983
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:28,020
each other's backs here.

984
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:30,440
Okay.

985
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:34,000
Speaking of,

986
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:36,840
I was looking over

987
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:36,840
your patient's chart,

988
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:36,840
Gerry Turner.

989
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:37,930
Oh, yeah?

990
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:40,910
It looks like

991
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:40,910
he's gonna need a fourth

992
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:40,910
Foley in two months.

993
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,740
Makes me think

994
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,740
it's time to try

995
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,740
something new.

996
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:44,820
Maybe an SP tube?

997
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,410
If nothing else,

998
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,410
it might...

999
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:49,960
No, you're right.

1000
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:49,960
That's a great idea, boss.

1001
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:51,590
Thanks for being

1002
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:51,590
so open, Dean.

1003
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:53,790
No worries.

1004
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:53,790
Thanks for having my back.

1005
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:03,400
Hey. Archer is gonna

1006
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:03,400
give Mr. Turner an SP tube.

1007
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:05,060
Oh, really?

1008
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:07,700
I had suggested

1009
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:07,700
the same thing.

1010
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:07,700
I know.

1011
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,650
Ms. Miller? My name

1012
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,650
is Sharon Goodwin.

1013
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:29,060
I'm the executive director

1014
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:29,060
of Patient Services

1015
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:29,060
here at Gaffney.

1016
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:32,660
This about payment?

1017
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:32,660
'Cause I have insurance.

1018
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:32,660
Through my job.

1019
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,670
What it doesn't cover,

1020
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,670
I'll have to figure out.

1021
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,670
I'm a single mom.

1022
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,900
No, I understand.

1023
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,900
But that's not why I'm here.

1024
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:42,070
Uh... Well, not directly.

1025
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:51,210
I wanted to speak

1026
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:51,210
with you regarding

1027
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:51,210
Jake's medical treatment.

1028
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:53,550
Revisit your options.

1029
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:56,680
I already told the doctor

1030
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:56,680
I want Jake to have

1031
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:56,680
the brain surgery.

1032
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:59,620
Yes, and I'm sure

1033
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:59,620
he informed you

1034
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:59,620
of the risks.

1035
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,630
That's right, he did.

1036
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,630
So, what's this about?

1037
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:07,060
Well, if you were to

1038
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:07,060
reconsider and go with

1039
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:07,060
the less invasive option,

1040
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:10,700
the stent, and if by some

1041
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:10,700
unfortunate circumstance,

1042
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,710
Jake were to suffer

1043
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,710
cognitive deficits,

1044
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:17,710
the hospital has resources

1045
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:17,710
that can help you

1046
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:17,710
take care of your son.

1047
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:21,050
You mean,

1048
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:21,050
financial assistance?

1049
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:21,050
Like, a loan?

1050
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:23,140
No, not a loan.

1051
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:23,140
More like a grant.

1052
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:24,720
Ms. Goodwin,

1053
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:24,720
may I speak with you...

1054
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:27,520
Give me a moment,

1055
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:27,520
Dr. Choi.

1056
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:33,830
Ms. Miller, I wanted you

1057
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:33,830
to hear me out first.

1058
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:35,860
But there's something

1059
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:35,860
you should know.

1060
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:40,830
I am the one that hit

1061
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:40,830
your son this morning.

1062
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,800
What? It was you?

1063
00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:47,030
Yes, I'm sorry.

1064
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:50,870
I didn't want

1065
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:50,870
to lead with that.

1066
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:53,640
Acting like

1067
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:53,640
you're here to help me,

1068
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:53,640
help my son?

1069
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:55,240
Ms. Miller, please.

1070
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:55,240
But I am.

1071
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:58,020
If you'll just

1072
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:58,020
allow me to explain.

1073
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:58,020
No.

1074
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:00,550
You're only here

1075
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:00,550
to cover your own ass.

1076
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:03,720
That's not true. I only want

1077
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:03,720
what's best for your son.

1078
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:06,690
Don't you dare

1079
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:06,690
try to tell me

1080
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:06,690
what's best for my boy.

1081
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:09,160
You're not the one

1082
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:09,160
who has to deal with this

1083
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:09,160
after today. I am!

1084
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:11,760
Okay, Ms. Goodwin. Please.

1085
00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:18,300
Excuse us.

1086
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:34,550
Nurse Sexton,

1087
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:34,550
give two of Versed.

1088
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,320
We don't usually sedate

1089
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,320
for SP tubes.

1090
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:40,820
I just want to make sure

1091
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:40,820
that Mr. Turner here

1092
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:40,820
is nice and relaxed.

1093
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:44,230
All right? It's not the most

1094
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:44,230
pleasant procedure.

1095
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:47,930
The Versed

1096
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:47,930
will put you in a nice,

1097
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:47,930
comfortable twilight.

1098
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,970
When you wake up,

1099
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,970
you won't remember

1100
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,970
a thing.

1101
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:52,230
You won't get any

1102
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:52,230
argument from me.

1103
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:54,970
Just the kind

1104
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:54,970
of patient I like.

1105
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:54,970
Nurse Sexton?

1106
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,070
Okay.

1107
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:01,300
Versed in.

1108
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,790
Okay.

1109
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:20,170
It's nice you and Ethan

1110
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:20,170
are still close.

1111
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:21,260
Excuse me?

1112
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,870
Didn't you guys

1113
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,870
used to date? It's just nice

1114
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,870
you're still friends.

1115
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:27,840
None of my exes

1116
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:27,840
will speak to me.

1117
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:30,100
Oh. Sorry to hear that.

1118
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:38,650
You know what?

1119
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:42,050
Why don't you

1120
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:42,050
do the honors?

1121
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,180
What?

1122
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,180
Yeah. Take over.

1123
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,950
No,

1124
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,950
I'm not allowed.

1125
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:49,760
Oh, from what I've heard,

1126
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:49,760
that's never

1127
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:49,760
stopped you before.

1128
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:52,800
And hey, nurse practitioner,

1129
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:52,800
give it a go.

1130
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:02,400
Here you go.

1131
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:09,740
Okay.

1132
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,090
I'm really not comfortable.

1133
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:16,050
It's just a big needle,

1134
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:16,050
is what it is.

1135
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,950
It's no different

1136
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,950
from putting in an IV.

1137
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,960
I'm meeting

1138
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,960
some resistance.

1139
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:26,690
Don't be afraid.

1140
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:26,690
Push harder.

1141
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:29,130
The catheter's not going in.

1142
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:31,800
Dr. Archer, can you

1143
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:31,800
please take over?

1144
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:33,330
His heart rate

1145
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:33,330
is dropping.

1146
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,380
Yeah, you're causing

1147
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,380
a vagal response. Go faster.

1148
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,970
Dr. Archer, would you

1149
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,970
please take over? Now!

1150
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,780
All right, all right.

1151
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,780
Calm down.

1152
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,210
In there.

1153
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:45,720
All right, one milligram

1154
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:45,720
Atropine.

1155
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:57,990
Yeah.

1156
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:01,990
And all's well

1157
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:01,990
that ends well.

1158
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:05,290
Okay.

1159
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:10,240
Come in.

1160
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:12,310
Hey there.

1161
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:12,310
Hey.

1162
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:14,880
I, uh...

1163
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,480
I heard about

1164
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:21,080
your run-in

1165
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:21,080
with Ms. Miller.

1166
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:21,080
Yeah.

1167
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:23,450
How you doing?

1168
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:23,450
I'm fine.

1169
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:26,280
I was just...

1170
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:29,760
All I was trying

1171
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:29,760
to do was help, Daniel.

1172
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:31,090
Of course you were.

1173
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,140
I was hoping for the sake

1174
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,140
of her son, that she could

1175
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,140
get over her anger

1176
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:38,500
and see that I was sincere.

1177
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:41,170
I just think that

1178
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:41,170
everything's still

1179
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:41,170
a little raw.

1180
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:45,980
You know? I mean,

1181
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:45,980
her world is...

1182
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:48,110
It is kind of spinning

1183
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:48,110
right now, right?

1184
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:50,140
Just like yours is.

1185
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:54,080
He can't die, Daniel.

1186
00:29:55,890 --> 00:29:57,260
That little boy

1187
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:00,790
has to make it.

1188
00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:03,290
I know how badly

1189
00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:03,290
you wanna fix this, Sharon.

1190
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:06,200
But, you know, it's just

1191
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:06,200
one of those situations

1192
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:09,070
that as cruel as it

1193
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:09,070
might seem, that...

1194
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,530
I don't know,

1195
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,530
it's kind of out of your

1196
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,530
hands, you know?

1197
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:17,910
I spend so much time trying to

1198
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:17,910
be prepared for anything.

1199
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:21,380
You know? Analyzing

1200
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:21,380
worst-case scenarios,

1201
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,920
trying to stay

1202
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,920
two steps ahead.

1203
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:26,420
Hmm. That's why

1204
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:26,420
you're so good at your job.

1205
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,510
And then this.

1206
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:36,060
It makes me wonder,

1207
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:36,060
what have I ever really

1208
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:36,060
had any control over?

1209
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,960
What do any of us really ever

1210
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,960
have any control over?

1211
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:42,040
In my experience,

1212
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:42,040
not a whole hell of a lot.

1213
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:45,930
It can actually

1214
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:45,930
be kind of freeing

1215
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:45,930
to remember that.

1216
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:49,410
You know?

1217
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:49,410
Helps you let go of it.

1218
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:51,070
You know me,

1219
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:53,310
and you know

1220
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:53,310
that's not one of my

1221
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:53,310
strong suits.

1222
00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:55,210
Is it anybody's?

1223
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:56,540
Anyway...

1224
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:01,820
I just know that for myself,

1225
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:01,820
when I'm feeling scared,

1226
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:05,920
it helps when I remember

1227
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:05,920
that I have people

1228
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:05,920
in my corner

1229
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,820
that love me.

1230
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,900
And God knows

1231
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,900
you got that in droves.

1232
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:20,860
What the heck was that?

1233
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,230
I don't follow.

1234
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:25,610
First, you force me

1235
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:25,610
into a procedure that

1236
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:25,610
I am not supposed to do.

1237
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:28,540
You're upset.

1238
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:28,540
Then when I ask

1239
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:28,540
for your help,

1240
00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:30,580
you refuse to throw me

1241
00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:30,580
a life vest?

1242
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,180
You should've

1243
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,180
jumped in immediately.

1244
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:33,580
I thought you'd welcome

1245
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:33,580
the challenge.

1246
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:35,860
Look, I know

1247
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:35,860
you didn't want to

1248
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:35,860
do this procedure,

1249
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:38,390
but if you think that

1250
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:38,390
I went behind your back

1251
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:38,390
to Ethan or something...

1252
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:40,460
No, excuse me. No,

1253
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:40,460
I never suggested that.

1254
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:43,360
I just believe

1255
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:43,360
the best way to learn

1256
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:43,360
is in the heat of battle.

1257
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:46,400
As a nurse practitioner,

1258
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:46,400
you're gonna be doing

1259
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:46,400
these procedures on your own.

1260
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:49,270
NPs don't put in

1261
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:49,270
SP tubes here.

1262
00:31:49,370 --> 00:31:52,930
Okay, listen to me.

1263
00:31:49,370 --> 00:31:52,930
You just need to work

1264
00:31:49,370 --> 00:31:52,930
on your confidence.

1265
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:56,470
You are an incredibly

1266
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:56,470
skilled nurse.

1267
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:58,370
Don't underestimate yourself.

1268
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:05,050
Hey, Bert. Uh, about earlier,

1269
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:05,050
I'm sorry.

1270
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:08,210
Can you just come back

1271
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:08,210
to the hospital?

1272
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,650
What are you...

1273
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:14,260
You're still here.

1274
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:14,260
Never left.

1275
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,560
Can we talk?

1276
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:24,400
Look,

1277
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:27,370
I shouldn't have forced you

1278
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:27,370
to leave this morning.

1279
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:29,530
But honestly,

1280
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,970
I was scared and feeling

1281
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:36,640
really exposed.

1282
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:41,450
Yeah. I'm sure

1283
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:41,450
I didn't help coming in,

1284
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:41,450
trying to take charge.

1285
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:45,360
It's just that, uh,

1286
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:45,360
when I saw you hurt,

1287
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,620
I wanted to

1288
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,620
take care of you.

1289
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:53,530
I went into husband mode.

1290
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:53,530
But I know that's not

1291
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:53,530
my role anymore.

1292
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:55,330
Oh, no.

1293
00:32:57,170 --> 00:33:00,230
But you're my friend.

1294
00:32:57,170 --> 00:33:00,230
A good friend.

1295
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:02,640
And you've more

1296
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:02,640
than proven that.

1297
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:04,680
I'm always gonna

1298
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:04,680
show up for you, Sharon.

1299
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:08,680
Doesn't matter our title.

1300
00:33:09,050 --> 00:33:10,570
It goes deeper than that.

1301
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:12,680
We're family.

1302
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:12,680
Yes.

1303
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:19,960
You know, that boy Jake

1304
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:19,960
is in surgery.

1305
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:22,120
It's a risky operation.

1306
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:26,660
Whatever happens, I'm here.

1307
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,730
Thank you.

1308
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:41,440
Hey, Dr. Charles,

1309
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:41,440
did Dr. Archer

1310
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:41,440
ever reach out to you?

1311
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:45,750
No, he didn't. Why?

1312
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:45,750
He looking for a consult,

1313
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:45,750
or something?

1314
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:49,250
No. It's actually him

1315
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:49,250
I'm concerned about.

1316
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:55,190
He's having a hard time

1317
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:55,190
settling in or...

1318
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:55,190
A bit.

1319
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,160
Listen, I think he's

1320
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,260
holding onto some

1321
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,260
really heavy baggage.

1322
00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:01,770
Some of the same stuff

1323
00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:01,770
I was dealing with.

1324
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:03,200
And he's self-isolated.

1325
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:06,300
I'm worried he doesn't

1326
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:06,300
have anyone in his life

1327
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:06,300
he can open up to?

1328
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,310
Got it. Okay, buddy.

1329
00:34:08,410 --> 00:34:11,240
Well, message received.

1330
00:34:08,410 --> 00:34:11,240
Thanks for the heads-up.

1331
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:12,640
Thanks.

1332
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:20,190
Hey, got your text.

1333
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:20,190
Hey.

1334
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:24,490
What's going on?

1335
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:24,490
I'm sorry?

1336
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:27,320
Something's off.

1337
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:31,220
You say you don't

1338
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:31,220
blame me for your mom.

1339
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,390
I don't.

1340
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,230
But it's clear

1341
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,230
you don't want my help.

1342
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,800
Or at the very least,

1343
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,800
you no longer trust

1344
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,800
my instincts.

1345
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:39,630
I swear, it's not that.

1346
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:39,630
Then what is it?

1347
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,050
I've been open

1348
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,050
with you, Nat.

1349
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:51,410
I've shared a lot.

1350
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:51,410
You have.

1351
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,610
More than I've shared with

1352
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,610
anyone in a very long time.

1353
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:58,220
It's got to be

1354
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:58,220
a two-way street.

1355
00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:02,560
Crockett, I promise,

1356
00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:02,560
it is not you.

1357
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:06,700
Between my mom,

1358
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:06,700
Owen, and work,

1359
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,130
I don't have the bandwidth

1360
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,130
for anything else.

1361
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,730
To worry about anyone

1362
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,730
else's feelings.

1363
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,700
I'm not asking

1364
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,700
you to do...

1365
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,700
No, I'm sorry.

1366
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,170
I can't do this right now.

1367
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:19,540
Okay? I just

1368
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:19,540
need some space.

1369
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:31,850
Maggie?

1370
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:31,850
Yeah?

1371
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,250
I want to thank you again

1372
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,250
for offering to rep Gaffney

1373
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,590
at the residency fair

1374
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,590
this morning.

1375
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,660
Already have

1376
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,660
several applications.

1377
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,790
That was fast.

1378
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:41,630
Only made it through

1379
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:41,630
reviewing the first applicant,

1380
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:41,630
but...

1381
00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:45,540
Actually, she mentioned

1382
00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:45,540
in her email that she

1383
00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:45,540
spoke to you this morning?

1384
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:47,840
Do you remember her name?

1385
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:49,800
Vanessa something.

1386
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:52,700
Right. Vanessa Taylor.

1387
00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:54,780
Yeah. What was your

1388
00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:54,780
impression of her?

1389
00:35:56,550 --> 00:36:01,420
Uh... Good candidate.

1390
00:35:56,550 --> 00:36:01,420
Top of her class,

1391
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:03,720
already published in JAMA.

1392
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:06,690
It'd be great to get her.

1393
00:36:06,890 --> 00:36:10,390
Yeah, impressive.

1394
00:36:06,890 --> 00:36:10,390
I'll keep that in mind.

1395
00:36:06,890 --> 00:36:10,390
Yeah.

1396
00:36:11,930 --> 00:36:13,130
Right.

1397
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:18,700
Oh, Nurse Sexton?

1398
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:22,310
Do you still want me

1399
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:22,310
to reach out to Melinda?

1400
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:24,210
The head of

1401
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:24,210
the nursing school at Porter.

1402
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:26,210
Oh, right. Um...

1403
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:29,480
And also, I'm sorry

1404
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:29,480
about our misunderstanding

1405
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:29,480
earlier.

1406
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:33,150
I'd be happy to make a call.

1407
00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:35,780
For you?

1408
00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:35,780
Hell, I'll even write you

1409
00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:35,780
a glowing recommendation.

1410
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:38,390
I appreciate that.

1411
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:38,390
I'll let you know.

1412
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:40,220
Yeah. Please do.

1413
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:43,420
Okay. Good night.

1414
00:36:43,930 --> 00:36:45,190
Night.

1415
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:49,870
Oh! Dean!

1416
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:49,870
Quick question for you.

1417
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:49,870
Yeah, sure.

1418
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,670
Did they give you

1419
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,670
a welcome packet

1420
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,670
when you started?

1421
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:55,280
Uh, yeah, I think so.

1422
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:58,640
Admin is mandating

1423
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:58,640
these little

1424
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:58,640
mental health check-ins

1425
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:00,770
for all ED personnel

1426
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:00,770
during the pandemic.

1427
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:01,940
Yeah, sure.

1428
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:04,310
Quick, informal.

1429
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:04,310
Completely off the record.

1430
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:06,680
The only thing

1431
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:06,680
they care about

1432
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:06,680
is that you show up.

1433
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:09,190
So, it'd great

1434
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:09,190
if we could get

1435
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:09,190
that on the books.

1436
00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:11,520
Sure. I'll check my calendar,

1437
00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:11,520
and I'll call you tomorrow.

1438
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:13,560
Fantastic, thanks.

1439
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:13,560
Yeah, sure.

1440
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:24,730
Hey.

1441
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:24,730
Hey, Nat.

1442
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:27,470
Hey, you should know.

1443
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:27,470
I just admitted

1444
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:27,470
Elaine Watkins.

1445
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:29,630
Fever's worsening

1446
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:29,630
and her white count's up.

1447
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:31,910
So, they're gonna operate

1448
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:31,910
first thing in the morning.

1449
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:35,700
Too bad the NG tube

1450
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:35,700
didn't do the trick. But

1451
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:35,700
surgery was the right call.

1452
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:38,450
Yeah. That was Crockett's

1453
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:38,450
thinking, too.

1454
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:41,550
Well, good night.

1455
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:41,550
Night.

1456
00:37:41,650 --> 00:37:42,920
Oh, hey. Um...

1457
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,550
Whatever happened

1458
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,550
with security?

1459
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:48,320
Was Earl able

1460
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:48,320
to pull video for you?

1461
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:51,970
Dead-end, unfortunately.

1462
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:51,970
They delete footage

1463
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:51,970
every 72 hours.

1464
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:55,570
Mmm. Sorry to hear that.

1465
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:55,570
Night.

1466
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,390
Thanks.

1467
00:37:58,470 --> 00:37:59,700
Hey, almost forgot.

1468
00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:02,830
What was the name

1469
00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:02,830
of that trial patient

1470
00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:02,830
you saw?

1471
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:05,950
With the dry cough?

1472
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:05,950
Uh...

1473
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:07,810
I wanna properly record it

1474
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:07,810
in their trial folder.

1475
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:10,320
Just trying to stay

1476
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:10,320
on top of things

1477
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:10,320
moving forward.

1478
00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:12,350
Huh. Uh...

1479
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:16,320
Shoot. I cannot remember

1480
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:16,320
off the top of my head.

1481
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,620
I saw so many patients

1482
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,620
last week.

1483
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,620
Yeah. Of course.

1484
00:38:19,790 --> 00:38:21,790
But you know what?

1485
00:38:19,790 --> 00:38:21,790
I can look

1486
00:38:19,790 --> 00:38:21,790
into it tomorrow.

1487
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:24,330
But right now,

1488
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:24,330
I have to get home to Mom.

1489
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:24,330
So...

1490
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:25,630
I understand. That'll work.

1491
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:26,790
Okay.

1492
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:36,770
Dr. Choi? You got news?

1493
00:38:37,010 --> 00:38:38,950
Jake's surgery went well.

1494
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:43,420
Any complications?

1495
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,580
No, ma'am. They were

1496
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,580
able to reconstruct

1497
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,580
the vessel

1498
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:47,650
without clipping

1499
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:47,650
any small branches.

1500
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:50,590
He's still waking up,

1501
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:50,590
but they expect him

1502
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:50,590
to make a full recovery.

1503
00:38:50,690 --> 00:38:52,420
How soon

1504
00:38:50,690 --> 00:38:52,420
can he go home?

1505
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:56,000
Uh, will they keep him

1506
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:56,000
a few nights, or...

1507
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:58,390
Unfortunately,

1508
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:58,390
he's not going home.

1509
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,060
What?

1510
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,060
Why not?

1511
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,870
While investigating

1512
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,870
the accident,

1513
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,870
the police uncovered

1514
00:39:02,970 --> 00:39:05,700
why Jake was out

1515
00:39:02,970 --> 00:39:05,700
biking alone in the dark.

1516
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:08,830
His mom works an overnight

1517
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:08,830
custodial shift across town.

1518
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,800
Been leaving

1519
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,800
both kids by themselves.

1520
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,800
Wow.

1521
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:14,910
PD notified DCFS

1522
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:14,910
and they're on their way.

1523
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:17,570
Does the mother know?

1524
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:18,670
Not yet.

1525
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:21,510
I need you to hold off DCFS.

1526
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,090
Ms. Goodwin...

1527
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,090
Dr. Choi.

1528
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:25,450
Please. Just do it.

1529
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:37,360
Ms. Miller.

1530
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:40,570
I'm so glad that

1531
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:40,570
Jake's surgery went well.

1532
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:41,970
I told you to

1533
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:41,970
leave me alone.

1534
00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:45,340
I just came by to apologize

1535
00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:45,340
for my behavior earlier.

1536
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,610
Do I need

1537
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,610
to get security?

1538
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,610
Wait.

1539
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:51,110
I know you left

1540
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:51,110
your children alone

1541
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:51,110
last night.

1542
00:39:55,490 --> 00:39:56,820
You trying to say

1543
00:39:55,490 --> 00:39:56,820
this is my fault?

1544
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:58,950
I am not here to judge you.

1545
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:00,920
You think I wanna

1546
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:00,920
leave my kids alone?

1547
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:02,860
I don't have a choice.

1548
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:02,860
If I don't work,

1549
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:02,860
they don't eat.

1550
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,090
And I got no one to help me.

1551
00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:06,800
I'm sorry. You're in

1552
00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:06,800
an impossible situation,

1553
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:09,960
and I can't even imagine

1554
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:09,960
the pressure.

1555
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,770
I told Jake to stay

1556
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,770
in the house when I'm gone.

1557
00:40:15,410 --> 00:40:17,570
I never thought...

1558
00:40:15,410 --> 00:40:17,570
You're doing

1559
00:40:15,410 --> 00:40:17,570
the best you can.

1560
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:20,710
Yeah, well. I'm failing.

1561
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:23,880
You've got to give yourself

1562
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:23,880
some grace.

1563
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:28,580
Look, I had help,

1564
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:28,580
but being a working mother

1565
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:31,660
was still really

1566
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:31,660
very hard.

1567
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:38,050
I came by to offer you

1568
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:38,050
a day shift on the hospital's

1569
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:38,050
custodial staff.

1570
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:41,800
If you want.

1571
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:41,800
I know it's not much.

1572
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,800
But at least you'd

1573
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,800
have the peace of mind

1574
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:48,030
of knowing that your children

1575
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:48,030
are safe and in school,

1576
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:50,110
while you're at work.

1577
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,540
You'd really do that?

1578
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,550
Please, let me.

1579
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:59,050
Thank you.

1580
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:01,610
Mom.

1581
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:06,690
Honey, I'm here.

1582
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:06,690
I'm right here.
