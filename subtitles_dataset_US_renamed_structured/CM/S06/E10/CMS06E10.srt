1
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:06,060
Knight F six.

2
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:08,100
Then you've got mate in three.

3
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:08,100
Well done.

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,200
I don't spend all day

5
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,200
playing games.

6
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:12,740
Sabeena,

7
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:12,740
there's a restaurant in my

8
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:12,740
neighborhood opening up.

9
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,700
You wanna

10
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,700
check it out?

11
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,700
I'd like that.

12
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:19,400
Michael, I can't have

13
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:19,400
my medical reps upselling

14
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:19,400
during a procedure.

15
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,520
I can't welcome him

16
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,520
back to my OR.

17
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:25,640
Would it be too much

18
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:25,640
to ask for you to back

19
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:25,640
me up just a little?

20
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,650
I'm thinking

21
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,650
about reconnecting

22
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,650
with my daughter.

23
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:32,060
There's a program

24
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:32,060
that helps parents

25
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:34,060
track down the children

26
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:34,060
they put up for adoption.

27
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,460
It's been over 20 years.

28
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:39,000
She may not want

29
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:39,000
to reconnect.

30
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:46,500
Oh, hey. Good morning.

31
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:46,500
Hey.

32
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,740
Somebody woke up

33
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,740
on the right side of the bed.

34
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,670
Somebody got a sitter

35
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,670
for tonight.

36
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:51,770
Oh.

37
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:54,740
And that means she's gonna

38
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:54,740
bring food to your house.

39
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:54,740
What do you wanna eat?

40
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:57,580
Oh, whatever you want.

41
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:57,580
It's all good with me.

42
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:00,690
You always say that.

43
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:00,690
I wanna know what you like.

44
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:04,490
I like Thai, Indian,

45
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:04,490
pizza, burgers. I like it all.

46
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:06,190
You know, we have

47
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:06,190
been dating now, for,

48
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:07,290
I don't know how long,

49
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,160
and I still know

50
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,160
so little about you.

51
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:11,170
You know I like

52
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:11,170
Thai, Indian...

53
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:12,260
Oh, get out of here.

54
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:14,030
...pizza, burgers...

55
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:14,030
Go away.

56
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:17,530
Then he looked

57
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:17,530
at me and said,

58
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,400
"You know so much

59
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,400
about endoscopy,

60
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:20,810
"why don't you just

61
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:20,810
rep the line yourself?"

62
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:22,670
So, you're gonna be

63
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:22,670
in charge

64
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:24,370
of a whole new series

65
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:24,370
of devices?

66
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,450
That's right. And I'm telling

67
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,450
you, Ma, they're awesome.

68
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:27,680
Increased success rates

69
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,580
on embolization,

70
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,580
sclerotherapy,

71
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:31,480
stent and valve placement.

72
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:33,060
Really gonna help

73
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:33,060
a lot of people.

74
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,320
Oh, that's fabulous, Michael.

75
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,320
Good for you.

76
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:36,820
Thank you. But to be honest,

77
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:38,460
I am on the clock.

78
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,650
Can't waste any more time

79
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,650
talking to you.

80
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,390
Well, have at it.

81
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,390
All right.

82
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,760
Hey, Maggie.

83
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,760
Hey, Sharon.

84
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:51,130
You okay?

85
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:52,700
Mmm-hmm.

86
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:56,740
It's here.

87
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:56,740
About my daughter.

88
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:03,780
Wow. You tracked her down.

89
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:06,250
What are you gonna do?

90
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,580
I'm not ready

91
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,580
to open it.

92
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:13,250
Well, if you need me,

93
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:13,250
call, okay?

94
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,740
I have to admit,

95
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,740
I thought I had you

96
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,140
when I took

97
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,140
your king's knight.

98
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,800
Which is why

99
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,800
I let you take it.

100
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:29,500
What?

101
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:29,500
I knew you were

102
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:29,500
about to play

103
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:30,600
the Mecking Variation.

104
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:33,150
Because it's subtle

105
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:33,150
but brilliant?

106
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:35,880
Because you always play

107
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:35,880
the Mecking Variation.

108
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,120
Oh, all right.

109
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,120
I'm gonna need

110
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,120
a rematch tonight.

111
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:40,810
See if I can come up

112
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:40,810
with some surprises.

113
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,590
I'll see. I have two more

114
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,590
trial patient exams

115
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:46,130
and a status

116
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:46,130
report due.

117
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:46,130
Oh, my God! Mom!

118
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:49,560
Get a gurney!

119
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:49,560
What happened?

120
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,220
She's been

121
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,220
having palpitations,

122
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:53,130
but she wouldn't let me

123
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:53,130
bring her in until today.

124
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,330
Okay. Hi, I'm a doctor, too.

125
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,330
Does your mom have

126
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,330
any cardiac conditions?

127
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,570
Not that I know of.

128
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,570
But she's pregnant.

129
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:01,510
All right. We're gonna

130
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:01,510
get you up to the ED

131
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:01,510
and check you out, okay?

132
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,740
Is there anyone

133
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,740
you'd like us to call?

134
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,740
Her husband?

135
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,370
No. Gary's passed.

136
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:07,880
Anyone else?

137
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:07,880
The baby's father?

138
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,190
No. The baby's mine,

139
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,190
and my husband's.

140
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,720
Yours?

141
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,780
My mother's

142
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,780
carrying our baby.

143
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:32,560
Hello again.

144
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:33,660
Where are we at?

145
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,440
Miss Daniels is a 22-week

146
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:37,240
pregnant surrogate

147
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:37,240
for her daughter.

148
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:40,280
And I am seeing signs

149
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:40,280
of atrial fibrillation.

150
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:42,910
Okay. Do you mind me asking

151
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:42,910
how old you are?

152
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:44,680
Fifty-four.

153
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:48,450
I know

154
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:48,450
that's pretty old

155
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:48,450
to carry a baby,

156
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:51,490
but when Katie asked me,

157
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:51,490
I just couldn't...

158
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:52,920
He's busy, Mom.

159
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:55,660
I'm sure he just wants you

160
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:55,660
to answer the questions.

161
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,790
Uh, so, has this ever

162
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,790
happened before?

163
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,330
No.

164
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,200
And any other medical history

165
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,200
we should know about?

166
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,210
Uh, I'm allergic to shellfish.

167
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,840
And I had

168
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,840
a kidney stone once...

169
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:10,970
She's an alcoholic.

170
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:14,880
I'm sorry, Mom, it's true.

171
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,310
Recovering alcoholic.

172
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:20,510
I haven't had a drink

173
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:20,510
in two years, six months.

174
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:22,420
Do you think

175
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:22,420
that's why this is happening?

176
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,730
My husband and I,

177
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,730
we knew there might be

178
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,730
medical issues.

179
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:29,490
We couldn't afford

180
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:29,490
a professional surrogate.

181
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,000
Okay. Let us do

182
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,000
a few tests,

183
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,630
and we'll figure out

184
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,630
exactly what's going on.

185
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,730
And in the meantime,

186
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,930
we'll try to get

187
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,930
your heart back into

188
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,930
a normal rhythm, okay?

189
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:38,970
Excuse us.

190
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:44,400
What do you think?

191
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:46,540
She's unstable.

192
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:46,540
We need to cardiovert.

193
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,240
Mags, order an echo and

194
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,240
100 milligrams of flecainide.

195
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:50,610
We'll see how she does

196
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:50,610
over the next hour.

197
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,710
Hold up.

198
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,710
All right.

199
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,790
If this is alcoholic

200
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,790
cardiomyopathy,

201
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:55,260
we may want to

202
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:55,260
do it electrically.

203
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,880
But we don't want to affect

204
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,880
the baby's rhythm.

205
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:57,980
Meds would be safer.

206
00:04:58,460 --> 00:04:59,860
But less effective.

207
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,860
The longer this goes on,

208
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,860
the worse it could get.

209
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:04,960
So, what do you

210
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:04,960
want me to do?

211
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:09,730
Flecainide is standard

212
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:09,730
of care. We'll go with that.

213
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,540
What've we got?

214
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,670
I've got Arash Mehti,

215
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,670
shot in the leg.

216
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,770
Two of morphine

217
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,770
in the field, vitals stable.

218
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,650
Okay, Mr. Mehti,

219
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,650
I'm Dr. Marcel.

220
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,280
We're gonna take

221
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,280
good care of you, okay?

222
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,550
I don't want to be here.

223
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:26,920
Okay, we're just gonna take

224
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:26,920
a look at you, all right?

225
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,290
Let's get an X-ray in here.

226
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,530
Okay, here we go, guys.

227
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,530
On my count.

228
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:40,030
Nice and easy.

229
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:40,030
One, two, three.

230
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:46,970
No, please.

231
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:46,970
Whoa.

232
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:51,780
I can't afford this.

233
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:51,780
I'll go somewhere else.

234
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,410
Bring his head up.

235
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,410
Yep.

236
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,920
Okay. Listen to me,

237
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,920
Mr. Mehti, you need

238
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,920
to be in a hospital.

239
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:59,080
I don't want your leg moving

240
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:59,080
any more than it has to.

241
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:01,380
So, please stay calm.

242
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:01,380
Okay? Nice and still.

243
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:02,550
Let's move back.

244
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:18,030
Okay, Mr. Mehti,

245
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:18,030
looks like the bullet hit

246
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:18,030
one of your large vessels.

247
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:20,400
I need to operate in order

248
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:20,400
to stop the bleeding

249
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:20,400
and remove the bullet.

250
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:21,530
Is that okay?

251
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,630
Operate?

252
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,630
Yes.

253
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:23,800
No.

254
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:26,040
Dad, I don't

255
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:26,040
think you have a choice.

256
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:36,650
Mr. Mehti, your son's right.

257
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:36,650
You're still bleeding.

258
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:40,620
If we wait much longer,

259
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:40,620
you'll lose too much blood.

260
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:40,620
You will die.

261
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,560
Dad, just let him fix you.

262
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,890
Uh...

263
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,990
Please.

264
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,590
Mr. Mehti?

265
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,430
Fine.

266
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,540
Okay. Call the blood bank,

267
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,540
let OR know we're coming up.

268
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,630
You got it.

269
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,410
I'll see you soon. Okay?

270
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:08,990
Hi, Emily, I'm Dr. Manning.

271
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:08,990
What happened today?

272
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,790
I was on my way to the gym

273
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,790
and I got mugged.

274
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:13,890
Oh, my God.

275
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:13,890
I'm so sorry to hear that.

276
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,990
It's okay.

277
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,120
You mind if I just...

278
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:19,130
It's okay.

279
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:19,130
But he threw me pretty hard.

280
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:23,500
All right. Yeah,

281
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:23,500
it appears to be broken,

282
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,700
but I do want to do

283
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,700
an X-ray to confirm.

284
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:28,870
Thanks. And could she get

285
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:28,870
something for the pain?

286
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,970
She's trying

287
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,970
to be brave, but...

288
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:34,070
I'm sorry,

289
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:34,070
this is Brian, my husband.

290
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:37,610
Nice to meet you. And yes,

291
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:37,610
we can get you something.

292
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,980
Did you make

293
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,980
a police report?

294
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:41,820
No. The guy got away

295
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:41,820
so fast.

296
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,620
You should think

297
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,620
about filing one.

298
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,960
You'd be surprised

299
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,960
at how often

300
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,960
they find the suspect.

301
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:48,960
Nah, it's fine. I didn't even

302
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:48,960
get a good look at him.

303
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,620
Come on, Em.

304
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:52,760
If we're just

305
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:52,760
sitting here anyway,

306
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:52,760
we might as well.

307
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:56,030
My head hurts,

308
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:56,030
and it seems like such a pain.

309
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,910
Sweetie, the guy

310
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,910
broke your arm.

311
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,030
Okay.

312
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,510
Great. I'll send

313
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,510
someone in.

314
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,950
And in the meantime,

315
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,950
we will get you those meds.

316
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,950
Okay?

317
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:08,040
Mmm.

318
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:13,840
Hey.

319
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,860
Um, I have a patient in 3

320
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,860
who was just mugged,

321
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,760
and she seems like

322
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,760
she's in a little bit

323
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,760
of denial.

324
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,230
Would you mind talking

325
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,230
to her for a minute?

326
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:21,090
Just make sure

327
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:21,090
she's all right?

328
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:21,090
Not at all.

329
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,590
Thanks.

330
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,130
I've been

331
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,130
on hold for a while.

332
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,130
Where are you guys?

333
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,130
He's bleeding bad.

334
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:34,970
Can I help?

335
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,070
Are you a doctor?

336
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:37,170
No. I'm a nurse.

337
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,510
Good enough. Come on.

338
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,210
Sheet metal got his leg.

339
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:42,710
We tried to tie

340
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:42,710
a belt around it,

341
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:42,710
but it just keeps slipping.

342
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:45,510
Hey, my name is April.

343
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:45,510
I'm gonna try

344
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:45,510
to help you, okay?

345
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:48,020
Hey, April. I'm Russell.

346
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,890
Hey, Russell.

347
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,890
Just hang in there.

348
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,890
Thank you. All right. Hey.

349
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:54,530
Oh, that's too high

350
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:54,530
for a tourniquet.

351
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:54,530
You gotta press right here.

352
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,600
Yeah. And press

353
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,600
down hard. Harder.

354
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,560
Okay. What's in

355
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,560
that toolbox?

356
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:06,630
Hang on, Russell.

357
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:06,630
Okay, let me see.

358
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:14,210
Does that first aid kit

359
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:14,210
have any alcohol in it?

360
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,650
Yeah. Here you go.

361
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,650
All right.

362
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:21,750
This is gonna hurt,

363
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:21,750
okay? Get ready.

364
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:21,750
Okay.

365
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:28,600
I know, I know. Okay.

366
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:28,600
God!

367
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:31,060
Hang in there.

368
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:35,000
Press down harder.

369
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:35,000
Use all your weight, okay?

370
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:36,870
Can you hold his legs,

371
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:36,870
so, he doesn't kick?

372
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:38,130
Yeah.

373
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,840
I know, Russell.

374
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,840
I gotta clamp your artery.

375
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:46,980
Just keep pressing.

376
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:54,220
Yeah. Got it.

377
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,060
Ease up, slowly.

378
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:05,590
Is he gonna be okay?

379
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:07,760
I think so.

380
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:17,000
What do we got?

381
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:21,170
Russell Byrd, 26,

382
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:21,170
lacerated femoral artery

383
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:21,170
with significant blood loss.

384
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,810
BP 90/55,

385
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,810
heart rate 115.

386
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,150
Got a liter

387
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,150
of saline en route.

388
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,720
What? Were you

389
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,720
repiping his sink?

390
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,620
We were

391
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,620
at a construction site.

392
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,620
I had no choice.

393
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,120
Serrated teeth,

394
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,120
no less.

395
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:32,020
Ugh. The whole artery

396
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:32,020
wall's ground beef.

397
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:33,790
Okay, go get

398
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:33,790
yourself cleaned off.

399
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,260
No, it's okay. I got it.

400
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,260
Look, you've done enough.

401
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,990
Okay? Nancy?

402
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,990
Sorry.

403
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:41,070
And tell the OR to hang vanc

404
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:41,070
and gent when we get there.

405
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:43,640
And hopefully,

406
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:43,640
this guy's still got a leg

407
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:43,640
when he gets out.

408
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,770
So, I talked with

409
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,770
your patient, Miss Norris.

410
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,370
And there could be a little

411
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,370
residual shock there.

412
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,170
But I don't know, I just...

413
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,170
Something's not adding up.

414
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:58,950
You know, I can't escape

415
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:58,950
the feeling we're not

416
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:58,950
getting the whole story.

417
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:00,850
How so?

418
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:00,850
Hey, guys.

419
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:03,080
Station checked

420
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:03,080
all the cameras

421
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:03,080
in a three-block area.

422
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:04,990
Said they couldn't find

423
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:04,990
any footage of an attack.

424
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:07,250
Oh. Thanks.

425
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:07,250
Mmm.

426
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,920
OR's ready

427
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,920
to plate her arm.

428
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:15,730
Okay. Um, I just have

429
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:15,730
a couple of questions.

430
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:18,360
Um, so, you said

431
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:18,360
you were attacked

432
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:18,360
at 6:00 a.m.

433
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:20,200
Yeah?

434
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:20,200
Give or take, yeah.

435
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:21,330
And you were

436
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:21,330
on a sidewalk?

437
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,710
Not in an alley

438
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,710
or anywhere else?

439
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:26,980
Is there something wrong?

440
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:26,980
Because the cop asked

441
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:26,980
these same questions.

442
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:30,710
No, they're just having

443
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:30,710
a hard time finding video

444
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:30,710
of the incident. That's all.

445
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,410
See, I told ya,

446
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,410
this was a waste of time.

447
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,710
They just want to help.

448
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,220
I know. But I'm cold,

449
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,220
and hurt,

450
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:39,420
and I just want this

451
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:39,420
to be over with already.

452
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:42,290
Let's get her a blanket.

453
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:42,290
No, it's okay. Here.

454
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,960
We're gonna get you

455
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,960
through this

456
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,960
and go home. Okay?

457
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,100
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

458
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,100
Hey. You want us

459
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,100
to dress those for you?

460
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,110
Oh. Uh, I'm fine.

461
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:05,980
Those look like

462
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:05,980
fingernail scratches, yeah?

463
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:07,720
Yeah, they did.

464
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:11,190
Maybe I need to

465
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:11,190
have a little chat

466
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:11,190
with Mr. Norris.

467
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,930
We never did get

468
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,930
that coffee this morning.

469
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:21,060
After an hour

470
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:21,060
of trial questionnaires,

471
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:21,060
I'm sure you could use it.

472
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,930
Miss Daniels

473
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,930
is still in a-fib.

474
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:24,060
Saw that.

475
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:26,140
I think we should switch

476
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:26,140
to electrocardioversion.

477
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:28,040
I'd rather stick to meds

478
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:28,040
and up the dose.

479
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:30,870
Okay if I observe?

480
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:30,870
I'm invested.

481
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:32,170
Yeah, of course.

482
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:36,010
Ethan, her heart rate's

483
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:36,010
only getting worse.

484
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,480
I really think we should

485
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,480
change course.

486
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,250
Okay.

487
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:50,060
All right, Miss Daniels,

488
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:50,060
we're putting a little

489
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:50,060
sedative into your IV,

490
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,430
so you should only

491
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,430
feel a small jolt.

492
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:56,460
And this won't

493
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:56,460
hurt the baby, right?

494
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:58,210
Mom, just let them

495
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:58,210
do their job.

496
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:01,470
Mary?

497
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:01,470
We'll be very careful.

498
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,500
Kate, please.

499
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:06,750
Okay, here we go.

500
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:08,870
Right here.

501
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:08,870
Charging to 50.

502
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:13,880
And one, two, three.

503
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:19,990
Nothing.

504
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:19,990
Miss Daniels, you okay?

505
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,260
Good. Fifty again.

506
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,430
And one, two, three.

507
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:32,270
It's not working.

508
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:32,270
Let's increase her meds.

509
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:33,470
No, let's go to 100.

510
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:37,940
And one, two, three.

511
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:41,850
She's in v-fib.

512
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:43,950
No pulse.

513
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:43,950
Charging to 200.

514
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:45,040
What's going on?

515
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,850
The current flipped her

516
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,850
into a more

517
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,850
serious arrhythmia.

518
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,390
We have to shock

519
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,390
her out of it.

520
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,390
Clear.

521
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,250
Oh, my God.

522
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:55,460
Still no pulse.

523
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:55,460
Push a milligram of epi!

524
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,830
Charging to 200 again.

525
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,830
Epi's in.

526
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,190
Clear.

527
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,230
Sinus rhythm.

528
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,140
Pulse is back.

529
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:09,970
Mary?

530
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:14,540
What happened?

531
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:18,510
Your, uh, heart issue

532
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:18,510
is still not under control.

533
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,550
And I'm sorry,

534
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,550
but at this point,

535
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,850
we have to be prepared

536
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,850
for this to happen again.

537
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:25,120
Get another 12-lead.

538
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:27,920
Call me

539
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:27,920
if anything changes.

540
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:29,120
Yeah.

541
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:38,400
All right.

542
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:38,400
Vessel's repaired,

543
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:38,400
clamp's coming off.

544
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:41,130
Just gotta grab that bullet,

545
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:41,130
and take this thing home.

546
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:43,100
Help me pull

547
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:43,100
the artery over.

548
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:45,950
It's over

549
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:45,950
as far as it'll go.

550
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:48,350
Huh. Try the other way.

551
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:55,110
Dr. Marcel?

552
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:59,190
I can't find the bullet.

553
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:59,190
It was right here

554
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:59,190
in the X-ray.

555
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:02,490
All right,

556
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:02,490
somebody check his bed,

557
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:02,490
make sure it didn't fall out.

558
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,590
On it.

559
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:07,200
You sure you read it right?

560
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:07,200
Leg film, easy to turn

561
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:07,200
upside-down.

562
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,270
No, Marty,

563
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,270
it wasn't upside-down.

564
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:11,340
The bullet's

565
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:11,340
not in here anywhere.

566
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:15,400
Bed's clean.

567
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,880
Okay. Did anybody

568
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,880
touch his leg

569
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,880
between the ED and here?

570
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:21,250
Because if it didn't

571
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:21,250
fall out, I don't know

572
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:21,250
where else it could be.

573
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,480
All right. Get me

574
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,480
an X-ray here, stat.

575
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:26,180
Move.

576
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:26,180
Yes, Doctor.

577
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,920
So, I heard

578
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,920
you're thinking of doing

579
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,920
an interposition graft?

580
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:33,950
What are you doing?

581
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:36,420
Scrubbing in. I spoke

582
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:36,420
with the charge nurse.

583
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:38,360
I got a team. Thanks.

584
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:41,130
I understand.

585
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:41,130
But I came in

586
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:41,130
with this patient,

587
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,460
and I'd like to

588
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,460
see it through.

589
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:45,060
April, I appreciate

590
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:45,060
your enthusiasm.

591
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:46,400
But you're an ED nurse.

592
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:49,340
I'm sure you could be of help

593
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:49,340
to someone down there.

594
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,610
Mr. Norris?

595
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,610
Hey.

596
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,910
There you are.

597
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:00,350
Will she have her phone

598
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:00,350
when she gets out

599
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:00,350
of surgery?

600
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,220
I like to send her

601
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,220
little messages.

602
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,260
Oh. What, from the watch?

603
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,260
Yeah.

604
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,160
Yeah, that's cool.

605
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,160
I had this thing for years.

606
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:08,630
I still haven't gotten around

607
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:08,630
to figuring that part out.

608
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:09,920
Yeah, absolutely.

609
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:12,230
We can make sure

610
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:12,230
she has it

611
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:12,230
when she wakes up.

612
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:13,590
So, look,

613
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,540
um, your wife gets attacked

614
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,540
on the street this morning.

615
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:20,040
What do you think

616
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:20,040
she does next?

617
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:20,040
Does she call you up?

618
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:23,010
Or does she just

619
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:23,010
walk home? Or...

620
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:23,010
She might've called.

621
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:27,280
I don't know.

622
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:27,280
Uh, truth is,

623
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:29,410
it would take a marching band

624
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:29,410
to wake me up in the morning.

625
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:31,550
Oh. Bit of a night owl?

626
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:34,950
No, I just can't seem

627
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:34,950
to get good sleep lately.

628
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:39,120
Why do you think,

629
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:39,120
you got stress at work,

630
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:39,120
or something?

631
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:41,490
No, I'm actually retired.

632
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:43,190
Really?

633
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:43,190
Yeah.

634
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,460
From what?

635
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,460
Army.

636
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,090
173rd Special Troops,

637
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,090
Afghanistan.

638
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,030
Oh.

639
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,030
Been back three months.

640
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:52,970
Wow. Huh. Afghanistan.

641
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:55,700
That... Was that rough?

642
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,340
Oh, it wasn't so bad.

643
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:02,740
Anyway, you're not

644
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:02,740
getting sleep. That's when

645
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:02,740
you have accidents, right?

646
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:05,210
How did you say

647
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:05,210
you did that again?

648
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:08,410
I don't know.

649
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:08,410
Uh, maybe yard work.

650
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,080
Hmm.

651
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,080
I have no idea.

652
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:15,090
Anyway, Emily should be

653
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:15,090
getting out soon.

654
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,360
Can I go wait for her

655
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,360
in Recovery?

656
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,090
Yeah. I'll totally

657
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,090
arrange that.

658
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:22,430
These things can also

659
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:22,430
help you figure out what's

660
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:22,430
going on with your sleep, too.

661
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:23,530
You know that?

662
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:23,530
Yeah.

663
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,160
I think Emily might

664
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,160
have put one of those apps

665
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,160
on here for me.

666
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:27,260
Oh.

667
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:27,260
Let's have a look.

668
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,070
Hey. So, get this.

669
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:36,210
Mr. Norris

670
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:36,210
is ex-military.

671
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:38,720
Just back from Afghanistan

672
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:38,720
three months ago.

673
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:43,450
And we all know how

674
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:43,450
complicated those transitions

675
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:43,450
back to civilian life can be.

676
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,650
But for what it's worth,

677
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:48,060
he's not throwing off

678
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:48,060
an abusive profile for me.

679
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,750
Take a look at this.

680
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:51,730
Those are

681
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:51,730
her medical records

682
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:51,730
from East Mercy.

683
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,660
She's been there twice

684
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,660
in the last month

685
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:56,100
for bruising

686
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:56,100
on her rib cage

687
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:56,100
and a bloody nose.

688
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:57,760
She's being abused.

689
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:07,210
Third time

690
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:07,210
she's coded in an hour.

691
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,250
The fetus is putting

692
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,250
too much strain

693
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,250
on her heart.

694
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:11,320
But we can't deliver,

695
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:11,320
she's only 22 weeks.

696
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:12,550
We have to stick

697
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:12,550
with the playbook and hope

698
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:13,710
the higher dose

699
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:13,710
of meds works.

700
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,650
Or we try

701
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,650
something else.

702
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,650
Now, what?

703
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,750
Tetracaine.

704
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,750
Are you kidding?

705
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:19,350
You give it

706
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:19,350
as an infusion,

707
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:21,360
block her sodium channels

708
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:21,360
and reset her rhythm.

709
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:23,660
That's only been tried

710
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:23,660
in a handful of cases.

711
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:23,660
There's no hard data.

712
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,630
Yes, it's cutting-edge,

713
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,630
but it could be a home run.

714
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,670
Or it could cause asystole

715
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,670
and kill her.

716
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:29,760
I understand,

717
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:29,760
but we can't keep

718
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:29,760
going like this.

719
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:32,240
Each shock we give her,

720
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:32,240
increases the chance

721
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:32,240
of fatal arrhythmia.

722
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,670
I want to protect

723
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,670
the fetus as well,

724
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:35,570
but our duty is

725
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:35,570
to our patient first.

726
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:35,570
Ethan...

727
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,650
You've already done

728
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,650
enough damage as it is.

729
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,370
We're sticking

730
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,370
with the meds.

731
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:46,180
I know.

732
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:46,180
I'm such a klutz.

733
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:48,780
One time, I tripped

734
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:48,780
at the gym and landed

735
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:48,780
on some weights.

736
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:51,480
And the other time,

737
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:51,480
I ran into a door.

738
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,490
Did Brian go to

739
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,490
the ED with you?

740
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:56,200
I didn't tell him.

741
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:56,200
I was embarrassed.

742
00:18:56,330 --> 00:19:01,170
Huh. You guys, you seem

743
00:18:56,330 --> 00:19:01,170
so close. I don't get why

744
00:18:56,330 --> 00:19:01,170
you'd be embarrassed.

745
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,870
What is going on?

746
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:05,700
Look, Emily,

747
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:05,700
if there is anything

748
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:05,700
you want to tell us...

749
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:09,770
Wait, you're not

750
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:09,770
suggesting that he had

751
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:09,770
anything to do with this?

752
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:13,680
All three injuries

753
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:13,680
have happened since Brian's

754
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:13,680
been back from deployment.

755
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:15,720
Look, Brian is a good man.

756
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,610
He's a good man

757
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,610
who went through combat.

758
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,550
And as I'm sure you know,

759
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,550
people can...

760
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,390
They can come back

761
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,390
with issues.

762
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:27,390
It wasn't easy for him,

763
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:27,390
what he saw there.

764
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,660
But what matters now,

765
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,660
is that he's back

766
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,660
and we're together.

767
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:34,400
Okay. But no matter

768
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:34,400
what happened

769
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:34,400
to him over there,

770
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,730
it is not okay

771
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,730
if he's hurting you.

772
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:39,360
You don't know

773
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:39,360
what you're talking about.

774
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:41,470
Emily,

775
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:41,470
please, we're just...

776
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:41,470
I think that you should leave.

777
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,840
Look, I... Okay.

778
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:53,320
She's protecting him.

779
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:53,320
It's classic

780
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:53,320
battered woman syndrome.

781
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:56,410
You know, very possibly.

782
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:56,410
But I don't know,

783
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:56,410
something's still...

784
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,530
It's just not adding up.

785
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:01,190
All of these ER visits,

786
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,590
all these injuries

787
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,590
are taking place

788
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,590
very early in the morning.

789
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,760
Okay. So, they fight

790
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,760
in the morning.

791
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:08,300
But what if he's not

792
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:08,300
fighting her at all?

793
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:12,240
What if he's fighting with

794
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:12,240
something else and she just

795
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:12,240
happened to be there?

796
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:17,870
Nat, no wonder

797
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:17,870
he can't remember where

798
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:17,870
these scratches come from.

799
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:21,410
I think that this

800
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:21,410
might all be happening

801
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:21,410
when he's asleep.

802
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,250
How do you prove that?

803
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,680
I have an idea.

804
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:34,890
You lost a bullet?

805
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:34,890
We didn't lose it.

806
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,860
It's called

807
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,860
a bullet embolism.

808
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,300
It got pulled through

809
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,300
the hole in your vein

810
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,300
and traveled up to the liver.

811
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,730
It's lodged

812
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,730
inside the vessel there.

813
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:48,540
Look, Mr. Mehti,

814
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:48,540
this is not what we wanted,

815
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,310
but we're gonna get

816
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,310
this taken care of, okay?

817
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:53,400
However,

818
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:53,400
since you've already been

819
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:53,400
put to sleep today,

820
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:56,480
I do want to wait

821
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:56,480
two days before

822
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:56,480
opening you back up again.

823
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:58,640
Two days?

824
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:58,640
Yeah.

825
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,430
I'll give you guys

826
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,430
some space.

827
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:20,340
Hey, uh, Dr. Marcel?

828
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:20,340
Yeah?

829
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,380
Look, I'm sorry

830
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,380
about my father.

831
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,240
No, it's okay.

832
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,240
If it helps,

833
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:25,640
his anger is actually

834
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:25,640
directed at me.

835
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:27,810
Don't worry about it.

836
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:32,650
He gave up everything

837
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:32,650
to come to America.

838
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:32,650
To give me opportunities.

839
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,850
What do I do?

840
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,850
I insist on being

841
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,850
a musician.

842
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,490
He says I'll never

843
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,490
earn a living.

844
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:39,030
He hates my music.

845
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:42,490
His disappointment's

846
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:42,490
over a lot more

847
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:42,490
than a bullet.

848
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,730
I understand it.

849
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,370
And you don't have

850
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,370
to worry about my feelings.

851
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,270
Let's just get your

852
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,270
father fixed up. Okay?

853
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:52,270
Yeah.

854
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:52,270
All right.

855
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:56,410
Dr. Marcel?

856
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:56,410
Yeah.

857
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:58,950
I don't mean to butt in,

858
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:58,950
but I overheard you talking

859
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:01,350
and I think

860
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:01,350
there's a way you could

861
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:01,350
avoid another surgery.

862
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:03,470
How's that?

863
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:03,470
I've got this new

864
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:03,470
endoscopic device

865
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:06,020
to deploy artificial

866
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:06,020
heart valves.

867
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:09,590
It extends mechanical fingers

868
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:09,590
to release the valve.

869
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:12,020
You're thinking it

870
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:12,020
could work in reverse?

871
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:12,020
Exactly.

872
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:13,590
Just grab the bullet.

873
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:15,630
But it's not

874
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:15,630
approved for that.

875
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:17,930
This would have

876
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:17,930
to be off-label, right?

877
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:17,930
It would.

878
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:20,590
But if you're

879
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:20,590
trying to avoid

880
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:20,590
an open surgery...

881
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:22,560
Right.

882
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:25,970
It's actually

883
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:25,970
a pretty good idea.

884
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,070
All right, let's do it.

885
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:43,690
Maggie's just wondering

886
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:43,690
if you need someone

887
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:43,690
to cover for you.

888
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:46,790
Um, no, I'll be down

889
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:46,790
in a minute.

890
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:50,330
Hey, you okay?

891
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,970
What if I cost this man

892
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,970
his leg, or worse?

893
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:57,440
April, don't get

894
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:57,440
caught up in that.

895
00:22:57,570 --> 00:22:59,670
I'm sure you did

896
00:22:57,570 --> 00:22:59,670
everything possible.

897
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,070
How's she doing?

898
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:13,380
Still in and out of v-tach.

899
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:17,390
Ethan's giving her

900
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:17,390
the standard meds,

901
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:17,390
which maybe is for the best.

902
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:19,980
But you have something

903
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:19,980
better in mind.

904
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:19,980
Tetracaine.

905
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:22,860
It's risky

906
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:22,860
and may not even work,

907
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,760
but how do we sit here

908
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,760
with an ace up our sleeve

909
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,760
and not even try?

910
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:29,890
I'm with you.

911
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:29,890
When I practiced

912
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:29,890
medicine in India,

913
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,940
every time I looked

914
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,940
a patient in the eye,

915
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,600
knowing their life

916
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,600
was on the line,

917
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:36,880
I couldn't stop till I knew

918
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:36,880
I did everything I could.

919
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:40,680
Anyway,

920
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:40,680
easy for me to talk.

921
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:54,020
It's a medicine

922
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:54,020
that's unproven, but could

923
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:54,020
reset your rhythm for good.

924
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,790
Now, the problem is,

925
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,790
there's also a small chance

926
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:58,830
it could stop

927
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:58,830
your heart completely.

928
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,030
Oh, my.

929
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,030
I know.

930
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:03,470
And that's why I'm not

931
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:03,470
pushing you to do it.

932
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:09,170
But I'm not sure how many

933
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:09,170
more rounds of defibrillation

934
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:09,170
your heart can handle.

935
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:12,780
So, if this sounds

936
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:12,780
like something you want

937
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:12,780
to know more about...

938
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,180
If my heart stopped,

939
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,450
what would happen

940
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,450
to the baby?

941
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:27,790
It's too small, so,

942
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:27,790
it wouldn't be able

943
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:27,790
to live outside of you.

944
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,890
I see.

945
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:33,090
But if I don't make it,

946
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:37,090
is there a way to keep

947
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:37,090
the baby alive inside?

948
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,730
Ms. Daniels,

949
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,730
let's not go there yet.

950
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,470
No. I've read about this.

951
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:42,510
Some kind of machine

952
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:42,510
you hook me up to,

953
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:44,440
so the baby

954
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:44,440
can keep growing?

955
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:45,980
Yeah, we could.

956
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,810
But it's a complicated issue.

957
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,140
Maybe you wanna wait

958
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,140
for your daughter.

959
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:51,010
No.

960
00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:54,150
This is my decision.

961
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,460
I was never there for Kate.

962
00:24:58,690 --> 00:24:59,820
I was too drunk.

963
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:06,930
Her dad traveled for work,

964
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:06,930
so, she had to walk herself

965
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:06,930
to school,

966
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:09,130
find her own dinner,

967
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:09,130
put herself to bed.

968
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:12,800
And I know I can never

969
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:12,800
make up for that.

970
00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:17,140
But now,

971
00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:17,140
she wants a child

972
00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:17,140
more than anything.

973
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,570
To finally

974
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,570
have a family.

975
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:26,180
And if this medicine

976
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:26,180
is my best chance

977
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:26,180
to give her that,

978
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:27,480
then I want it.

979
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:30,950
Mary.

980
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:36,060
This is a big decision.

981
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:39,860
You sure you don't

982
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:39,860
wanna take some time

983
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:39,860
to think about it?

984
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:41,530
Thank you, Maggie.

985
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,870
But I know my answer.

986
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:48,970
I'm not gonna let

987
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:48,970
my daughter down again.

988
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:56,880
Okay. I'll set it up.

989
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,920
Will? Will.

990
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:10,620
Shouldn't we wait

991
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:10,620
for Kate to be part

992
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:10,620
of this decision?

993
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:14,000
You heard her. Okay?

994
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:14,000
She's trying so hard

995
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:14,000
to make up for the past,

996
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:17,560
not being there

997
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:17,560
for her daughter.

998
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:17,560
Let's give her that chance.

999
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:32,650
Will. You talked her

1000
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:32,650
into this infusion

1001
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:32,650
behind my back?

1002
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:35,020
I didn't talk her

1003
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:35,020
into anything.

1004
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:35,020
It's what she wants.

1005
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,320
What is wrong with you?

1006
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,320
You needed to

1007
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,320
come to me first.

1008
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:40,180
Hey, I tried. You're too

1009
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:40,180
stuck on a treatment

1010
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:40,180
that isn't working.

1011
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:42,020
So, you're just

1012
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:42,020
gonna risk her life?

1013
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:45,130
No, I'm doing what both I

1014
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:45,130
and our patient think is best.

1015
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,930
Mom, this is crazy.

1016
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,930
There's no way.

1017
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:50,560
I've made my decision.

1018
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:53,070
No. This is stupid

1019
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:53,070
and reckless.

1020
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:54,730
I have to do something.

1021
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:57,610
Every time they shock me,

1022
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:57,610
it puts the baby in danger.

1023
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:59,840
I don't care.

1024
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:59,840
Of course you care.

1025
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:02,670
This baby means everything.

1026
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:05,220
No, it doesn't.

1027
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:05,220
Kate...

1028
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:08,220
You've been waiting

1029
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:08,220
for this forever.

1030
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:08,220
Mom...

1031
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:13,090
This baby doesn't mean

1032
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:13,090
as much as you do.

1033
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:18,330
Ms. Daniels,

1034
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:18,330
you're starting to

1035
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:18,330
throw irregular beats.

1036
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:21,300
What do you want us to do?

1037
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:25,900
Please, let me do this.

1038
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:28,100
Mom, no.

1039
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,130
I love you, sweetheart.

1040
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:36,980
I'm ready.

1041
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:36,980
Start the infusion.

1042
00:27:47,930 --> 00:27:49,290
How is he?

1043
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,060
There was enough artery

1044
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,060
left to repair,

1045
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:54,690
and he's perfusing well,

1046
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:54,690
so, I think

1047
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:54,690
he's gonna be fine.

1048
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:55,860
Thank God.

1049
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:58,230
Hey, April.

1050
00:27:58,370 --> 00:28:01,370
He lost a lot more blood

1051
00:27:58,370 --> 00:28:01,370
out there than I realized.

1052
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:04,270
So, you didn't just

1053
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:04,270
save his leg.

1054
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:04,270
You saved his life.

1055
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:06,340
Pretty good for a nurse.

1056
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:08,840
You should've gone

1057
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:08,840
to med school.

1058
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:20,060
Is there a reason

1059
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:20,060
why we're still here?

1060
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,430
The orthopedist said she's

1061
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,430
medically cleared to leave.

1062
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:25,670
Yes, but we would like

1063
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:25,670
to speak with you first.

1064
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:30,740
Brian, I think that

1065
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:30,740
you are suffering

1066
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:30,740
from a form of PTSD.

1067
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,830
What?

1068
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,830
Okay, this is enough.

1069
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:34,370
He's not even

1070
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:34,370
the patient here.

1071
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:36,340
Please, just bear with us

1072
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:36,340
for a moment.

1073
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:40,070
I think that you're

1074
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:40,070
experiencing something

1075
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:40,070
called "PTSD nightmares."

1076
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:43,010
Now, the word "nightmares"

1077
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:43,010
is misleading.

1078
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:44,950
They're actually much more

1079
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:44,950
like sleep terrors.

1080
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:47,750
The difference being,

1081
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:47,750
people often

1082
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:47,750
don't remember them.

1083
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:51,420
But your body

1084
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:51,420
still very much

1085
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:51,420
experiences them.

1086
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,350
To the point that

1087
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,350
on certain nights,

1088
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:58,260
the intensity leads you

1089
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:58,260
to literally act them out,

1090
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:58,260
physically.

1091
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:00,890
In this case, on Emily.

1092
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,860
No.

1093
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:06,870
She has been

1094
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:06,870
to the hospital for injuries

1095
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:06,870
twice before today.

1096
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,430
What?

1097
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:11,010
It's nothing. It's fine.

1098
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:14,110
Please, we're just

1099
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:14,110
trying to get him

1100
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:14,110
the help that he needs.

1101
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:16,950
No, You're trying to report

1102
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:16,950
this as domestic abuse

1103
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:18,040
and get

1104
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:18,040
the police involved.

1105
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:20,420
Listen, we are legally

1106
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:20,420
obligated to report this.

1107
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:24,020
But I guarantee you,

1108
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:24,020
because of the specifics

1109
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:24,020
of this case,

1110
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:26,030
that Brian, he's not

1111
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:26,030
gonna be prosecuted.

1112
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:28,030
He'd still end up

1113
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:28,030
with it on his record.

1114
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,100
And then what?

1115
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,100
A mental health diagnosis?

1116
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,190
These things

1117
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,190
follow you your whole life.

1118
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:34,990
Em, maybe we should

1119
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:34,990
talk about this.

1120
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:36,130
No.

1121
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:39,370
The Army, the hospital...

1122
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:39,370
They won't protect you.

1123
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:42,870
I am the only one

1124
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:42,870
who will protect you.

1125
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:42,870
Okay.

1126
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:46,850
Emily, Brian and I

1127
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:46,850
were discussing his sleep.

1128
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:48,880
Do you mind

1129
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:48,880
bringing up that app again?

1130
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:50,110
Yeah.

1131
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:53,850
The watch tracks

1132
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:53,850
his sleep patterns.

1133
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:57,120
Most people have

1134
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:57,120
a sleep efficiency

1135
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:57,120
of around 85%.

1136
00:29:57,220 --> 00:30:01,180
That means a lot

1137
00:29:57,220 --> 00:30:01,180
of deep sleep.

1138
00:29:57,220 --> 00:30:01,180
Very little movement. Okay?

1139
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:05,060
As you can see,

1140
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:05,060
Brian's sleep efficiency,

1141
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:05,060
it averages around 50%.

1142
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:09,800
And on the days that

1143
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:09,800
you went to the hospital,

1144
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:09,800
it was down to 10%.

1145
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:10,930
So, what?

1146
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,870
You see right here,

1147
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,870
early in the morning?

1148
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:15,340
All that movement?

1149
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:17,800
Those are night terrors.

1150
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:22,310
Emily, did I do this?

1151
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:24,180
No.

1152
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:24,180
Emily,

1153
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:27,350
you came in here today

1154
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:27,350
with a broken arm.

1155
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:29,250
Next time,

1156
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:29,250
it could be far worse.

1157
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:32,250
Em, tell me the truth.

1158
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,380
Brian...

1159
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:36,960
Have I hurt you?

1160
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:39,190
Brian...

1161
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:42,570
Honey, please,

1162
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:42,570
I couldn't live

1163
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:42,570
with myself.

1164
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,260
You didn't mean to.

1165
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:45,360
Oh, my God.

1166
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:46,800
You didn't mean to.

1167
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:48,430
I'm so sorry.

1168
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:50,170
I know. I know.

1169
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:50,170
I'm so sorry.

1170
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:52,800
No. It's okay.

1171
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:52,800
It's not your fault.

1172
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:54,380
It's not your fault.

1173
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,110
We can help you.

1174
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:02,350
I'll do whatever

1175
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:02,350
it takes.

1176
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:08,590
Starting infusion.

1177
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:16,840
Her rhythm's erratic.

1178
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:16,840
It's not gonna

1179
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:16,840
hold for long.

1180
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:18,060
Are you okay, Mom?

1181
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:24,140
BP is falling.

1182
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:24,140
She's having runs of v-tach.

1183
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,970
We need to cardiovert.

1184
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,970
No.

1185
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,970
The baby...

1186
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,970
Ma'am...

1187
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,480
Give the medicine

1188
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,480
a chance.

1189
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:32,220
Your pressure's

1190
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:32,220
dangerously low.

1191
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,350
Mary?

1192
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:39,590
Mom?

1193
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,260
Come on,

1194
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,260
let them do it!

1195
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,320
Let's give it a minute.

1196
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,630
Ms. Daniels,

1197
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,630
we're running out of time.

1198
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,260
Ms. Daniels?

1199
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,260
Mom?

1200
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:53,470
Don't let her die!

1201
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,270
She's in v-tach.

1202
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,170
Charging 200.

1203
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,170
Ethan.

1204
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,380
Charge, clear.

1205
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,920
Mags, clear.

1206
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:10,880
Mags.

1207
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:13,320
Clear!

1208
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:16,560
Maggie.

1209
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:19,460
Sinus rhythm.

1210
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:23,990
It worked.

1211
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,300
Thank you.

1212
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,160
This is where

1213
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,160
we deployed the device.

1214
00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:49,990
But as you can see,

1215
00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:49,990
when we tried to

1216
00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:49,990
grasp the bullet,

1217
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:52,000
it slipped away.

1218
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:54,660
Which dislodged it

1219
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:54,660
from the vessel wall

1220
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:54,660
and into the current.

1221
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,990
Yeah, we tried to go

1222
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,990
after it again, but the

1223
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,990
blood flow was too strong.

1224
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:59,160
It got swept away.

1225
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:01,700
Swept away?

1226
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:01,700
So, where is it now?

1227
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,540
It's in the right atrium

1228
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,540
of the heart.

1229
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,540
They're finishing up

1230
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,540
the echo now.

1231
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:08,650
Using a device off-label?

1232
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:08,650
What were you thinking?

1233
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:11,080
I was trying to avoid

1234
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:11,080
another open surgery.

1235
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:13,950
Look, while the outcome

1236
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:13,950
wasn't ideal,

1237
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:13,950
the bullet is safe.

1238
00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:16,550
So, we'll go in tomorrow,

1239
00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:16,550
same as we would have done.

1240
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:19,560
Promoting your products

1241
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:19,560
for unapproved uses?

1242
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:21,990
It made sense.

1243
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:21,990
It could have worked.

1244
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:24,590
Ms. Goodwin,

1245
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:24,590
I'm the surgeon of record.

1246
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:24,590
It's not his fault.

1247
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,640
This is far beyond

1248
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,640
the bounds of

1249
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,640
professional conduct.

1250
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:30,330
Dr. Marcel?

1251
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:30,330
Yeah.

1252
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,430
You need to see this.

1253
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:33,270
Excuse me.

1254
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:47,340
What is it?

1255
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:50,250
He's got

1256
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:50,250
a ventricular-septal defect.

1257
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:52,490
A hole between

1258
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:52,490
the two sides of his heart.

1259
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:54,120
Didn't you know

1260
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:54,120
about this?

1261
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:56,160
No. Nobody did.

1262
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:56,160
Wasn't in his history.

1263
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,730
What does that mean

1264
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,730
for the patient?

1265
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:59,290
If the bullet

1266
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:59,290
passes through it

1267
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,490
from the right side

1268
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,490
into the left,

1269
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:03,630
it could shoot up

1270
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:03,630
into his brain and cause

1271
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:03,630
a massive stroke.

1272
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:06,230
Gotta get him

1273
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:06,230
into the OR, now.

1274
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,710
How's it looking?

1275
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:19,310
Got some

1276
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:19,310
high line pressures.

1277
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:21,450
He's getting coagulogenic.

1278
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:21,450
Better move it along.

1279
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,350
Yeah,

1280
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,350
right side's empty.

1281
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:25,450
Bullet must've passed

1282
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:25,450
through the defect

1283
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:25,450
after X-ray.

1284
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,720
Let's open up the left.

1285
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:29,030
Hang on.

1286
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:29,030
Sats are down to 92.

1287
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:31,600
What's going on?

1288
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:31,600
Oxygenator line

1289
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:31,600
is clotted off.

1290
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:33,130
Giving heparin.

1291
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:35,130
Let's get out of here.

1292
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:35,130
Nope, not yet.

1293
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:37,200
Eighty-four.

1294
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:37,200
If it's not there,

1295
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:37,200
we have to go.

1296
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:39,300
If it's not there,

1297
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:39,300
he's got bigger problems

1298
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:39,300
than his sats.

1299
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:41,740
Shut it off.

1300
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:41,740
We're down to 79.

1301
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,070
Shut it off!

1302
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:47,510
Come on.

1303
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,780
Dr. Marcel...

1304
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,780
Hold on.

1305
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,080
One last place.

1306
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:57,120
Under the valve.

1307
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:01,350
There you are.

1308
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:06,330
There it is.

1309
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:06,330
Yes!

1310
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:15,270
All right,

1311
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:15,270
let's close him up.

1312
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:15,270
5-0 Prolene.

1313
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:23,170
Is that the baby's heart?

1314
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:25,710
Yes, it is.

1315
00:35:26,490 --> 00:35:29,820
It looks very strong

1316
00:35:26,490 --> 00:35:29,820
and healthy.

1317
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:31,450
It's beautiful.

1318
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:07,760
I have already talked

1319
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:07,760
to the state's attorney,

1320
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:11,560
and he assured me

1321
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:11,560
that not only will Brian

1322
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:11,560
not face any charges,

1323
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:14,290
he won't even

1324
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:14,290
have a record. Okay?

1325
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:18,500
And as for the arrest,

1326
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:18,500
I'm sorry.

1327
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:18,500
It's just pro forma.

1328
00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:24,780
And the psychiatric facility

1329
00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:24,780
they're sending him to,

1330
00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:24,780
for how long?

1331
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:28,470
It's hard to say.

1332
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:28,470
Maybe a couple weeks,

1333
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:28,470
a few months.

1334
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:32,540
You know, there are some

1335
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:32,540
cutting-edge new therapies

1336
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:32,540
involving medications

1337
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:37,280
like MDMA, ketamine,

1338
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:37,280
that could shrink

1339
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:37,280
that time considerably.

1340
00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:39,790
And then he'll be

1341
00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:39,790
my Brian again?

1342
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:43,350
I think

1343
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:43,350
there's an excellent chance

1344
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:43,350
of that, really. I do.

1345
00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:47,590
I love you, Em.

1346
00:36:48,770 --> 00:36:49,830
I love you.

1347
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:00,540
Going behind my back,

1348
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:00,540
throwing up Hail Marys.

1349
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:03,340
We got the win today,

1350
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:06,280
but you and I

1351
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:06,280
have a problem.

1352
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:19,190
Hi. Mr. Mehti,

1353
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:19,190
how are you feeling?

1354
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:22,460
He's doing well.

1355
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:22,460
But he has something

1356
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:22,460
he wants to tell you.

1357
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:24,200
Okay.

1358
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:29,530
Doctor.

1359
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:29,530
Yeah.

1360
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:35,500
I want to apologize

1361
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:35,500
and thank you.

1362
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:51,960
It's okay.

1363
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,630
Thank you, Doctor.

1364
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,330
My pleasure.

1365
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:01,370
I'll check on you

1366
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:01,370
in a bit, okay?

1367
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:02,790
Okay.

1368
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:09,010
I don't know

1369
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:09,010
what you said,

1370
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:12,570
but whatever it was,

1371
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:12,570
it seemed to make him

1372
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:12,570
feel better.

1373
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:13,670
Yeah.

1374
00:39:14,910 --> 00:39:18,080
Yeah, I told him

1375
00:39:14,910 --> 00:39:18,080
he had a good kid,

1376
00:39:14,910 --> 00:39:18,080
he should give him a chance.

1377
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:42,940
Hey, you ready?

1378
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:42,940
Mmm-hmm.

1379
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:59,420
Mmm. You need

1380
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:59,420
to order every time because

1381
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:59,420
this rice is amazing.

1382
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:00,960
So good.

1383
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:00,960
Mmm-hmm.

1384
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:04,550
So, annoyingly enough,

1385
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:07,060
properly cooked, it's rice.

1386
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:07,060
Mmm-hmm.

1387
00:40:08,470 --> 00:40:10,460
And you burn it,

1388
00:40:08,470 --> 00:40:10,460
get it crispy

1389
00:40:08,470 --> 00:40:10,460
at the bottom...

1390
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:12,470
Tahdig.

1391
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:14,770
Yeah. Look at you.

1392
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:14,770
Mmm. Good to know.

1393
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:17,040
Yeah.

1394
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:17,040
Um, so...

1395
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:20,470
Your name,

1396
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:20,470
Crockett Marcel...

1397
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:20,470
Mmm-hmm.

1398
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:21,880
...doesn't sound very Persian.

1399
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:25,850
Yeah.

1400
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:25,850
My birth name is Darioush.

1401
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:25,850
Darioush Jahanbani.

1402
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:27,590
Darioush.

1403
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:27,590
My parents

1404
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:31,020
changed me and my sister's

1405
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:31,020
names to make it easier

1406
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:31,020
on us in school.

1407
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:34,620
Yeah, they picked Marcel

1408
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:34,620
'cause it was popular

1409
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:34,620
in New Orleans.

1410
00:40:34,790 --> 00:40:37,730
Hmm. And "Crockett"?

1411
00:40:34,790 --> 00:40:37,730
Where does that come from?

1412
00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:40,770
My pops was a big fan

1413
00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:40,770
of Miami Vice.

1414
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:43,760
Sonny Crockett.

1415
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:46,900
Oh.

1416
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:49,700
True story.

1417
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:49,700
Mmm-hmm.

1418
00:40:49,810 --> 00:40:50,800
You want some more tahdig?

1419
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:51,970
Ah. Yes, please.

1420
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:53,980
Absolutely.

1421
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,980
Yum. Thank you.

1422
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,980
You're welcome.
