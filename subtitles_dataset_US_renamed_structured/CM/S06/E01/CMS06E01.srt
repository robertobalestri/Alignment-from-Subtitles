1
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:15,010
Hang on, Hannah.

2
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:33,150
I love you.

3
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:16,760
Dr. Halstead.

4
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,630
Doris.

5
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:21,610
Any symptoms? Headache?

6
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:21,610
Dry cough?

7
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:21,610
No.

8
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:23,680
98.5, good.

9
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:23,680
Let's get you tested.

10
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:25,210
I was just tested

11
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:25,210
this morning.

12
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:26,410
You went home.

13
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,180
Nobody goes back in the ED

14
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,180
without getting tested.

15
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,220
Come on. Open up.

16
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:36,690
Jim, a word?

17
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:38,730
Let's take it inside.

18
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:38,730
I need a break.

19
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:55,340
Hey. This is April's third

20
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:55,340
straight week

21
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:55,340
in the COVID Ward.

22
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,300
We're short-staffed.

23
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,300
April volunteered.

24
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:00,370
Protocol is one week on

25
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:00,370
and one week off.

26
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,640
She's putting herself at risk.

27
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,220
I don't know

28
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,220
what to tell you.

29
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,080
April feels

30
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,080
this is her mission.

31
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:06,350
Jim, you're

32
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:06,350
the Chief of the ED.

33
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,450
You've gotta

34
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,450
protect your staff.

35
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,150
She knows what she's doing.

36
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:11,280
And what's it to you?

37
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:11,280
I thought you guys broke up.

38
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:13,390
That has nothing

39
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:13,390
to do with it.

40
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,160
Ethan, I need her, okay?

41
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:19,630
Check your iPad.

42
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:19,630
You got five patients.

43
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:22,300
You know the drill,

44
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:22,300
monitor them

45
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:22,300
from outside the room.

46
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,370
Leave it

47
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,370
to the nurses inside

48
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,370
to treat them.

49
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:29,240
Dr. Halstead?

50
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:29,240
COVID test was negative.

51
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:29,240
You're good to go.

52
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:20,350
Hannah's sats dropped

53
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:20,350
and we couldn't recover,

54
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:22,660
so, we intubated.

55
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:22,660
Figured you'd have to.

56
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,500
Now it looks like she has

57
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,500
a chemical pneumonitis,

58
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,190
aspirated some vomit.

59
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,770
So, I put an OG tube down

60
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,770
to decompress

61
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,770
her stomach, okay?

62
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:34,400
Hey, Will.

63
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:34,400
She's gonna be okay.

64
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,740
Yeah, thanks.

65
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,840
Crockett, I'm glad

66
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,840
you're taking care of her.

67
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:39,280
You got it.

68
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:42,220
Hey. I just got a text.

69
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:42,220
Hannah was brought in?

70
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:43,640
Yeah.

71
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:47,560
She's in here,

72
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:47,560
so, it can't be COVID.

73
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:52,450
Um... I found her unconscious

74
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:52,450
in her bathroom,

75
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,190
syringe in her arm.

76
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:57,320
She OD'd.

77
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:09,840
Hey. How you feeling?

78
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:11,310
Good. Fine.

79
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:13,250
Got your energy back?

80
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:16,280
Sharon, I am ready

81
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:16,280
to go back to work. Trust me.

82
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:18,550
Good. You've been missed.

83
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:20,220
How you been doing?

84
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,320
The board still doesn't

85
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,320
want me coming back

86
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,320
because of my diabetes.

87
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:27,400
So, all of my meetings

88
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:27,400
are virtual.

89
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:32,590
Like Zooming with ten people,

90
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:32,590
all in their little box.

91
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:35,670
It's driving me crazy.

92
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:35,670
I can't read the room.

93
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:40,570
I don't know if people

94
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:40,570
are actually paying attention,

95
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,910
or just looking down

96
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,910
at their phones.

97
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:44,480
There's already

98
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:44,480
a name for that,

99
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,240
they're calling it

100
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,240
"Zoom Fatigue."

101
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:48,650
I've already read

102
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:48,650
three psych papers on it.

103
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:49,770
And speaking of psych,

104
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:52,010
I need you to carve out time

105
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:52,010
for the staff.

106
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,290
There's just been no let-up

107
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:58,830
with the workload

108
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:58,830
and so many fatalities.

109
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:00,330
And then you add to that,

110
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:02,620
all the social trauma

111
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:02,620
they've been dealing with.

112
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:05,000
I'm sending out a memo, now.

113
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,320
Great, good.

114
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:08,770
And is Anna with you?

115
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:08,770
Yeah.

116
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:13,430
Yeah, we decided that

117
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:13,430
it was safe for her

118
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:13,430
to come back.

119
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,870
Say hi for me, okay?

120
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:18,910
Will do. Okay.

121
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:18,910
Take care of yourself.

122
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:20,850
Take care.

123
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,820
Morning.

124
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:32,520
Sharon Goodwin says hi.

125
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:37,030
So, I am going to work.

126
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:40,330
Uh...

127
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,460
You're pretty much

128
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,460
gonna stay put?

129
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:44,040
Dad, I'm not gonna go out.

130
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:46,810
That's good, because...

131
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:46,810
I mean, it's...

132
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:48,000
I know.

133
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:53,680
Okay. I'll see you later.

134
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:55,770
Bye.

135
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:06,880
Whoa!

136
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:06,880
Sorry!

137
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,550
Manning. Eyes on the road.

138
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,550
Sorry, Crockett.

139
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,030
Oh, hey.

140
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,030
Yeah?

141
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:12,070
Heard you moved into Club Med.

142
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:15,390
The Pavilion? Yes, I am.

143
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:16,590
Oh.

144
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,400
Watch yourself.

145
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:20,070
I hear it gets pretty rowdy

146
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:20,070
in there.

147
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,070
A lot

148
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,070
of questionable behavior.

149
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:24,000
Okay.

150
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:25,100
Nat?

151
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:25,100
Yes.

152
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:27,540
Check your iPad.

153
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:27,540
You're going to Treatment 4.

154
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:29,880
Got it.

155
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,510
See you, Crockett.

156
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:32,610
All right.

157
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:34,680
Mr. Lieu?

158
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:37,920
Hi, I'm Dr. Manning.

159
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:37,920
And you must be Kellie.

160
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:39,620
Hi.

161
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:42,700
I see Kellie's been dealing

162
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:42,700
with myelogenous leukemia.

163
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,820
For a couple years.

164
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:45,370
She's immunocompromised,

165
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:46,460
so, I didn't wanna bring her

166
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:46,460
into the hospital

167
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:47,930
if I didn't need to.

168
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,800
She was in remission,

169
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,800
but her leukemia came back.

170
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,140
So, we had to do chemo

171
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,140
all over.

172
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,030
Just finished the last round

173
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,030
eight weeks ago.

174
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,070
Just hope she won't

175
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,070
have to do it again.

176
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,370
Let's see.

177
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,380
You're having difficulty

178
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,380
breathing, aren't you?

179
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:05,390
It's okay, I'm used to it.

180
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:10,620
We're gonna help you

181
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:10,620
feel better, okay?

182
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:15,960
Let's get a CBC, a BMP, ECG,

183
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:15,960
an echo and a BNP, okay?

184
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,090
You got it.

185
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,670
You mind if I talk to your dad

186
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,670
for a moment?

187
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,540
So, I am hearing

188
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,540
an "S" three gallop

189
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,540
in her heart,

190
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,670
which means

191
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,670
it's struggling.

192
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,680
Also, her neck veins

193
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,680
are distended.

194
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:35,840
And I am seeing

195
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:35,840
some swelling in her legs

196
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:35,840
and ankles.

197
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:38,750
Those are symptoms

198
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:38,750
of heart failure, aren't they?

199
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:41,480
Her oncologist

200
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:41,480
warned us about that.

201
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,750
It's likely a result

202
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,750
of the chemo medication.

203
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:46,060
Unfortunately,

204
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:46,060
some are cardiotoxic.

205
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,030
They can damage

206
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,030
the heart muscle.

207
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:51,990
The good news is,

208
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:51,990
I think we can reverse it

209
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:51,990
if we change her medication.

210
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,530
So let's get

211
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,530
the test results back,

212
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,930
and then I will loop in

213
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,930
your oncologist, okay?

214
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,970
Okay. Thank you.

215
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,970
All right. Mmm-hmm.

216
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,670
Clear.

217
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,010
Mr. Booker?

218
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:09,950
I'm afraid your X-ray

219
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:09,950
looks wet.

220
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:13,180
That means

221
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:13,180
that you still have

222
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:13,180
fluid in your lungs.

223
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:15,720
The proning hasn't helped.

224
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:16,810
So, what now?

225
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:20,030
I suggest we intubate

226
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:20,030
and put you on a ventilator.

227
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:22,500
A ventilator?

228
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:22,500
You'll be sedated.

229
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,900
But I don't feel that bad.

230
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,970
I know, but the thing

231
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,970
that makes people feel bad,

232
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,970
a rise in CO2,

233
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:28,500
doesn't happen with COVID.

234
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,230
But you're still not getting

235
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,230
enough oxygen.

236
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:32,800
If we put you on a ventilator,

237
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:32,800
it'll allow you to rest.

238
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:34,600
Please. Can't you

239
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:34,600
wait a little longer,

240
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:35,900
make sure

241
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:35,900
I really need it?

242
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:39,980
If we wait and you go

243
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:39,980
into cardiac arrest,

244
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:39,980
we can't resuscitate you.

245
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,610
I know it's terrible,

246
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,710
but we can't run a code

247
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,710
in here.

248
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:46,190
Chest compressions release

249
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:46,190
so much virus.

250
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:50,020
Please, Alvin,

251
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:50,020
let us help you.

252
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:53,650
Okay.

253
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,130
Okay.

254
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,130
Twenty of etomidate,

255
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,130
a hundred of roc?

256
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:57,600
Start a propofol infusion.

257
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,900
I need to suit up.

258
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,900
I gotta go and intubate.

259
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:04,800
Dr. Marcel, look alive.

260
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:04,800
Incoming GSW.

261
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:09,810
Twenty-year-old male,

262
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:09,810
COVID negative,

263
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:11,210
gunshot wound

264
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:11,210
to the upper right thigh,

265
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:13,980
GCS 15. BP 100/77.

266
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,110
It hurts...

267
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:16,210
Gonna take care of that, bud.

268
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,010
Fifty of Fentanyl.

269
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,010
X-rays, meet us inside.

270
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:20,640
Gunshot wound?

271
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,250
Second one today.

272
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,650
COVID or no COVID,

273
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,650
some things never change.

274
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,700
How're we ever gonna heal

275
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,700
this city?

276
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:33,170
I know what you're gonna say.

277
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:33,170
"I told you so."

278
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,160
Why would I say that?

279
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:37,800
You said drug addicts can

280
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:37,800
replace drugs with romance.

281
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:38,900
Ring a bell?

282
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,970
Well, I mean, it happens.

283
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:43,970
Well, not with us.

284
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:47,550
We love each other. Okay?

285
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:50,020
Yeah, uh, sure, there's stress

286
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:50,020
because of the pandemic,

287
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,550
but everybody's feeling that.

288
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:53,780
And maybe

289
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:53,780
'cause of the quarantine,

290
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:55,250
we moved in sooner

291
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:55,250
than we would've.

292
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,720
Totally understandable.

293
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:58,760
Trust me, you are not

294
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:58,760
the only ones.

295
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,230
But we're making it work.

296
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:03,990
What happened last night

297
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:03,990
was a lapse. That's all.

298
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:07,070
Will, look. I'm not here

299
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:07,070
to confront you, buddy.

300
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:09,640
I mean, these sessions

301
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:09,640
are about one thing

302
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,600
and one thing only,

303
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,600
and that is

304
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:13,270
lowering your stress levels

305
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:16,040
in a time when practicing

306
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:16,040
emergency medicine

307
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:18,080
can be overwhelming.

308
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:19,610
You know, that's it.

309
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:23,010
Is that okay?

310
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,050
I'm sorry,

311
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,050
I haven't even asked

312
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,050
how you're doing.

313
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,820
I understand you had

314
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,820
a pretty bad time of it.

315
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:37,630
Yeah, this COVID thing

316
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:37,630
ain't no joke,

317
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:38,890
but, you know what,

318
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:38,890
I'm fine.

319
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,840
And, look,

320
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,840
I really appreciate

321
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,840
your asking,

322
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:44,200
but I really

323
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:44,200
wanna use this time,

324
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,210
if it's okay,

325
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,210
to talk about you,

326
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:47,740
you know,

327
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:47,740
and how you're doing.

328
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:51,610
I'm managing, I guess.

329
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:55,110
I mean, we finally have

330
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:55,110
enough PPE.

331
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:57,980
The safety protocols

332
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:57,980
seem to be working.

333
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:57,980
Okay, good.

334
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:01,180
I just...

335
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:04,010
What?

336
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:09,160
I thought we'd be over it

337
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:09,160
by now.

338
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,030
Three weeks straight?

339
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,130
Don't start, Ethan.

340
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,940
You're putting yourself

341
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,940
at risk.

342
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:23,100
Look around.

343
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:25,810
So many of these patients...

344
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:28,380
I see the people

345
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:28,380
I grew up with,

346
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,380
they're dying

347
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,380
at twice the rate.

348
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:31,880
I know. I know.

349
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:35,290
They've been discriminated

350
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:35,290
against their entire lives,

351
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:37,790
poverty,

352
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:37,790
terrible health care...

353
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:38,950
Now, they're hit with this.

354
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,050
Yeah.

355
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,160
April.

356
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:45,700
I'm just worried about you.

357
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,200
The two men I'm treating?

358
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:52,030
They are sick,

359
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:52,030
they are frightened,

360
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,700
and they are alone.

361
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:57,210
I'm not abandoning them.

362
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:09,220
Miss Palmer,

363
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:09,220
hi, I'm Dr. Halstead.

364
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,990
Hi. Call me Anita.

365
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:12,320
Okay.

366
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:14,060
This is her husband, Brad.

367
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:17,160
Hey, Brad,

368
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:17,160
sorry you can't be here.

369
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:19,000
We're limiting visitors

370
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:19,000
for safety.

371
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,230
No, I understand.

372
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,430
Thank you.

373
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,830
Is it true redheads

374
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,830
like spicy food?

375
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:26,030
Uh...

376
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:26,030
Haven't heard that one.

377
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:30,040
So, Anita,

378
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:30,040
you had a fall today, huh?

379
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:32,240
Yeah. In the kitchen

380
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:32,240
after breakfast.

381
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:34,180
Okay. You hurt your arm.

382
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,080
Mmm-hmm.

383
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,720
Did you lose consciousness?

384
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,720
No.

385
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:41,290
Oh! What happened here?

386
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:42,980
Oh.

387
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:46,230
That was a couple days ago.

388
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:48,460
She's actually fallen

389
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:48,460
three times

390
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:48,460
in the last week.

391
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,390
Any history

392
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,390
of low blood pressure,

393
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,390
fainting, or seizures?

394
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,870
Mmm-mmm.

395
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:54,300
On any new medications?

396
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,930
No. I don't take anything.

397
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,900
I think this country's

398
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,900
over-medicated.

399
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,510
I see you're

400
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,510
an air traffic controller?

401
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:01,370
Mmm-hmm.

402
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:01,370
Pretty stressful work.

403
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,310
No, I've been doing it

404
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,310
for five years.

405
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:06,040
I know where all those

406
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:06,040
little planes are going.

407
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:10,790
Impressive. Brad, can you

408
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:10,790
think of anything else?

409
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:13,750
She hasn't gone to the gym

410
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:13,750
since the pandemic,

411
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:16,290
and she stopped her paleo diet

412
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:16,290
a few weeks ago.

413
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,920
And I'm not seeing anything

414
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,920
that concerns me.

415
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:22,260
But we will get an EKG, labs,

416
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:22,260
and an X-ray of your arm,

417
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,800
see if we can't find out why

418
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,800
you've been unsteady lately.

419
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:25,890
Okey-dokey.

420
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,020
Hang in there.

421
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:32,930
She seem

422
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:32,930
a little high to you?

423
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,340
Yeah, maybe.

424
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,170
You know, some people get

425
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,170
a little loopy in the ED.

426
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:38,510
Add a tox screen

427
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:38,510
to her blood work.

428
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:40,410
Yeah. Blood alcohol?

429
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:41,840
Yeah. Okay.

430
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,990
Any change?

431
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,990
Not yet.

432
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:56,490
Dr. Halstead?

433
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:58,830
Sabeena Virani.

434
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:00,300
Uh...

435
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,960
I'm sorry, Dr. Virani.

436
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:04,270
We were supposed to meet

437
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:04,270
in the cardiology clinic.

438
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:06,430
If this isn't a good time...

439
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:09,140
No, it's just...

440
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:09,140
Someone I know.

441
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,370
I'm sorry. I'll catch you

442
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,370
another time.

443
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,980
Wait. You said you work

444
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,980
for Kender Pharma?

445
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,140
R&D.

446
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:20,220
We're running a trial at Med

447
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:20,220
for an oral

448
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:20,220
heart failure medication.

449
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,850
Dr. Ramsey

450
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,850
is principal investigator.

451
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:25,190
He thought

452
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:25,190
it'd be good to have

453
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:25,190
an ED doc as co-PI.

454
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:26,850
Recommended you.

455
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:31,330
Thanks. Another time,

456
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:31,330
I might be interested.

457
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:33,090
I just got a lot

458
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:33,090
going on right now.

459
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:36,570
I understand.

460
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:36,570
Hope everything works out.

461
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,180
Dina? Status on Mr. Booker?

462
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:47,940
Sats are stable.

463
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:49,540
Keep me posted.

464
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:51,580
Ethan.

465
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:53,480
Coming to you.

466
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:58,350
Mr. MacNeal,

467
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:58,350
his sats are 85.

468
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:00,190
I think you better

469
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:00,190
talk to his wife.

470
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,360
Mrs. MacNeal?

471
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:10,530
Hi, I'm Dr. Choi. I've been

472
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:10,530
treating your husband today.

473
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:13,270
Please. How is he?

474
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:15,500
I'm sorry to say,

475
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:15,500
he's not doing well.

476
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:18,910
His oxygen saturation level

477
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:18,910
is still only 85,

478
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:20,480
a good ten points

479
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:20,480
under what it should be.

480
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:22,910
Oh, my God.

481
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:25,420
We've done everything we can

482
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:25,420
with the ventilator,

483
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:28,510
inhaled nitrous oxide,

484
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:28,510
100% oxygen,

485
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,590
and, unfortunately,

486
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,590
nothing's worked.

487
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,520
So, if the ventilator

488
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,520
hasn't helped,

489
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:36,960
what else can we...

490
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:36,960
There is one more thing

491
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:36,960
we could try.

492
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,990
It's called ECMO.

493
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,500
It's a life support system

494
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,500
that takes the place

495
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,500
of the lungs.

496
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,400
Life support?

497
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,400
That sounds so...

498
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,400
It is.

499
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:48,540
It is, ma'am.

500
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,310
I don't wanna minimize

501
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,310
the seriousness

502
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:54,410
of your husband's condition.

503
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:58,110
At this point, I believe

504
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:58,110
ECMO is his only option.

505
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,650
Do we have

506
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,650
your permission?

507
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:07,290
Yes. Of course.

508
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:07,290
Please, save my Freddie.

509
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,560
I'll do my best, ma'am.

510
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:20,960
Oh, hey.

511
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:22,370
Hi, sweetie!

512
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,110
Hey, how's the arm?

513
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:27,150
The X-ray's negative.

514
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:27,150
Her arm is not broken.

515
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,050
Yay! It's not broken.

516
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:31,720
But there is one thing.

517
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:36,380
So, your labs show you have

518
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:36,380
a blood alcohol level of 0.14.

519
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:38,120
A what?

520
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:40,420
It indicates that you had

521
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:40,420
alcohol today.

522
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:42,650
No, I didn't.

523
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,360
No. No way.

524
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,040
So, I'm just wondering

525
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,040
maybe if that's the reason

526
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,330
you've been falling lately.

527
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:53,970
No, no. I haven't had

528
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:53,970
any alcohol today.

529
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,270
What about last night?

530
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:59,010
No. I don't drink.

531
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:59,010
I don't like the taste.

532
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:59,010
Yuck!

533
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:02,170
Tell you what,

534
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:02,170
why don't we get some more

535
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:02,170
fluids in your system

536
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,650
and we'll be back

537
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,650
to check on you

538
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,650
in a bit. Okay?

539
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,210
Okay.

540
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:12,290
She's drunk.

541
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:14,660
Well, something's going on.

542
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,560
I think he has

543
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,560
a serious problem.

544
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:21,330
Hey, it might be

545
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:21,330
a one-time event,

546
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:21,330
set off by some stressor.

547
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,630
The woman's fallen

548
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,630
three times

549
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,630
in the last week.

550
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:25,040
Wouldn't you call that

551
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:25,040
a pattern?

552
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:27,630
Her husband said

553
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:27,630
she doesn't drink.

554
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:27,630
She doesn't drink.

555
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:31,370
So, let's monitor her BAC

556
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:31,370
and when she comes down,

557
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:31,370
we'll chat with her.

558
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:33,280
Wh...

559
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:36,440
Hey. Kellie Lieu,

560
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:36,440
my peds patient

561
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:36,440
with leukemia?

562
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:38,450
Yeah. The labs and history

563
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:38,450
just came in.

564
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:39,540
Oh, perfect.

565
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:45,120
Not good, huh?

566
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:45,120
No.

567
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:47,620
I need a surgical consult.

568
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:49,720
All right. I'll ask Crockett.

569
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,460
You know what? Wait.

570
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,460
Don't page Crockett.

571
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,460
Just page whoever's on call.

572
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:55,660
Hello?

573
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:00,170
Make sure he gets that.

574
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:00,170
Why not Crockett?

575
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:02,510
It's nothing.

576
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:02,510
I just need a consult,

577
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:04,480
and so, I was gonna page

578
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:04,480
the call person.

579
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:06,150
Why do that? I'm free.

580
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,470
Okay.

581
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:08,570
Okay.

582
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:12,750
Uh, the patient

583
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:12,750
is Kellie Lieu. She's 12.

584
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:14,580
She's been battling leukemia.

585
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:17,280
She presented today

586
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:17,280
with chemo-induced

587
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:17,280
heart failure.

588
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:18,620
Is that why you didn't want

589
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:18,620
to bring me in?

590
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:22,360
Kid with leukemia?

591
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:22,360
'Cause I lost my little girl?

592
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:25,460
I just thought maybe

593
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:25,460
it was a little too close

594
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:25,460
to home.

595
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:28,330
Thank you.

596
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:28,330
Tell me about the patient.

597
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,740
BNP's 2500,

598
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,740
ejection fraction 15%.

599
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:33,830
Bad numbers.

600
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,200
And it just gets worse.

601
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:40,150
Her latest blood smear shows

602
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:40,150
an increase in elevated cells

603
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:40,150
in her bone marrow.

604
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:41,680
So, the cancer's

605
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:41,680
coming back.

606
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:41,680
Yeah.

607
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:44,720
Okay, send me the chart.

608
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:44,720
And what you just did?

609
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,790
That's why I don't tell people

610
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,790
about my past.

611
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:57,530
The leukemia's

612
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:57,530
gonna come back?

613
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:01,160
Yes, it seems like it is.

614
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:02,530
I'm so sorry, Mr. Lieu.

615
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:06,830
So, we have to start

616
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:06,830
chemo again?

617
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,510
Eventually, yes.

618
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:11,640
But right now,

619
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:11,640
Kellie's heart's too damaged

620
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:11,640
for more chemo.

621
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:14,270
Getting her heart in shape

622
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:14,270
has to be our first priority.

623
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:18,150
Yes, okay,

624
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:18,150
how do we do that?

625
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:19,520
Well, there are

626
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:19,520
two options.

627
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:20,640
The first, we talked about,

628
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,350
replace Kellie's

629
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,350
current regimen

630
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,350
with one that's less toxic,

631
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:26,480
but in addition,

632
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:26,480
we add Milrinone to ease

633
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:26,480
the strain on her heart.

634
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:29,190
But we don't know how long

635
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:29,190
that would take to work,

636
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:32,460
and if the cancer comes back

637
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:32,460
before her heart

638
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:32,460
is healthy for chemo,

639
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:33,900
we'd have no way

640
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:33,900
to fight it.

641
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,210
You said there's

642
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,210
a second option?

643
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,810
Surgery. Implant an LVAD.

644
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:42,880
An assist device

645
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:42,880
that would take the pressure

646
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:42,880
off Kellie's heart

647
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:44,410
so it can recover faster.

648
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:46,670
Surgery?

649
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:48,180
That would be

650
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:48,180
my recommendation.

651
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,270
But you have to know

652
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,270
it comes with risks, okay?

653
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:51,880
Kellie is immunocompromised,

654
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:54,490
that increases the chance

655
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:54,490
of post-op infection.

656
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:56,820
And with COVID,

657
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:56,820
the danger is even greater.

658
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,430
So, you don't advise surgery?

659
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,200
Well, we've learned

660
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,200
how to mitigate those risks.

661
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:05,360
Still, LVADs are rarely used

662
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:05,360
in pediatric cases

663
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:07,330
because they are tailored

664
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:07,330
to fit adults.

665
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,530
That's because there aren't

666
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,530
many kids with Kellie's level

667
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,530
of heart disease.

668
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,230
If you two don't agree,

669
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,230
how can I make

670
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,230
this decision?

671
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:18,510
Mr. Lieu, I know how...

672
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:18,510
We know how difficult this is,

673
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:18,510
but I would...

674
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:20,910
I don't think you do!

675
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:26,580
I lost my wife two years ago.

676
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,320
She's not here to help me.

677
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,550
The world is upside-down.

678
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:38,690
Yesterday, a woman

679
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:38,690
in the parking lot

680
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:43,740
pointed at us and screamed,

681
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:43,740
"You brought COVID here!

682
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:43,740
It's your fault!

683
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,240
"Go back where you're from!"

684
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:51,940
I have to worry about

685
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:51,940
my daughter's leukemia,

686
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:55,680
the pandemic,

687
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:55,680
and now,

688
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:55,680
that we could get attacked?

689
00:20:57,890 --> 00:20:59,550
Who do I trust?

690
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,810
I'm sorry

691
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,810
this is happening to you.

692
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,260
All I wanna do is

693
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,260
what's best for Kellie.

694
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:06,620
The safest thing.

695
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,590
And that doesn't

696
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,590
sound like surgery.

697
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:18,800
We'll try the medication.

698
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:20,500
All right.

699
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:20,500
I'll call your oncologist

700
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:22,630
and we'll get started.

701
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:22,630
Thank you.

702
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:29,010
Hey.

703
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:29,010
Yeah?

704
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,480
What's going on with you?

705
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,920
When did you get

706
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,920
so hyper conservative?

707
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,650
I thought he should have

708
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,650
all the facts.

709
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:35,520
Let me tell you something,

710
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:38,320
you talked that man

711
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:38,320
out of an operation

712
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:38,320
his little girl needs.

713
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:48,560
Thank you.

714
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:50,830
What are you doing?

715
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:53,810
Dr. Lanik canceled

716
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:53,810
Mr. MacNeal's ECMO.

717
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,370
Why did you cancel it?

718
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:00,780
He shouldn't have ordered it

719
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:00,780
in the first place.

720
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,780
Excuse me.

721
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,780
He's my patient.

722
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,850
And I'm Chief of the ED.

723
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,850
I have to allocate resources.

724
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:08,790
We only have four ECMOs

725
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:08,790
for the entire ward. Four.

726
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:10,320
Three are already in use.

727
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:11,790
Which leaves one

728
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:11,790
for Mr. MacNeal.

729
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:14,360
April, I can't tie up

730
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:14,360
my last circuit on him.

731
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:15,590
Especially when we know

732
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:15,590
Mr. Booker,

733
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,360
who still has a chance,

734
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,360
is gonna need it.

735
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:18,690
You don't know

736
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:18,690
he's going to need it

737
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:18,690
for sure,

738
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,460
and ECMO's the only thing

739
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,460
that could possibly save

740
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,460
Mr. MacNeal's life.

741
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:23,370
The man is gonna go

742
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:23,370
into multi-organ failure.

743
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:26,730
Over the last six months,

744
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:26,730
how many times

745
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:26,730
have we seen this?

746
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,640
ECMO is not gonna

747
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,640
change the outcome.

748
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:31,740
You can't say that for sure.

749
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:31,740
You're just gonna give up?

750
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:34,920
We've done

751
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:34,920
everything we could.

752
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,880
You want to make me

753
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,880
the bad guy? Get in line.

754
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,550
Crockett?

755
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,550
Yeah.

756
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:53,100
Oh, yeah. She's doing fine.

757
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:56,000
Aced her spontaneous

758
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:56,000
breathing trial.

759
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:56,000
I just extubated her.

760
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:58,470
You can head in.

761
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:58,470
All right.

762
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:06,640
Hey.

763
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:08,340
I'm so sorry.

764
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:10,880
It's all right, Hannah.

765
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:10,880
It's all right.

766
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:11,980
No.

767
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:16,020
No, you trusted me.

768
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:16,020
And I let you down.

769
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:19,430
Hey, the most important thing

770
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:19,430
is you're okay.

771
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:20,990
And you will come back

772
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:20,990
from this.

773
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:28,960
When they were taking me

774
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:28,960
out of the ambulance,

775
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:32,440
as messed up as I was,

776
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:32,440
I could still hear you.

777
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,950
You said, "I love you."

778
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:40,840
I do.

779
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:48,920
I swear I will

780
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:48,920
make this up to you.

781
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:51,990
When I get out of here,

782
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:51,990
I will go straight into rehab.

783
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:55,730
I'm gonna be so good.

784
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:59,560
Dr. Halstead.

785
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:59,560
They need you.

786
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,400
You rest.

787
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:07,770
I don't want it!

788
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,400
Okay.

789
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:10,770
Sweetie,

790
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:10,770
these are electrolytes.

791
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,970
No!

792
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,970
You need them.

793
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,810
No. Let me alone,

794
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,810
I wanna go home!

795
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,810
Hey.

796
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:16,780
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

797
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:16,780
Anita, I'm sorry.

798
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:16,780
Get security in here.

799
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,850
Anita, I'm sorry.

800
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,850
I can't let you leave

801
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,850
in this condition.

802
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:20,850
What condition?

803
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:20,850
There's no condition.

804
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,550
You're intoxicated.

805
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,550
I am not!

806
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:23,650
I am not!

807
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:23,650
Okay.

808
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:25,090
Earl...

809
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:25,090
Let go!

810
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:26,590
Fifty of Benadryl.

811
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:28,190
I got it. Earl,

812
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:28,190
come up here, please.

813
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,490
No.

814
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,760
Thank you.

815
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,760
No! You can't!

816
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:31,960
Okay, hold on, sweetie.

817
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:34,470
I wanna go home!

818
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:34,470
Okay.

819
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:35,590
All right.

820
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:43,130
You were right.

821
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:46,440
When am I gonna learn?

822
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,580
Dr. Halstead.

823
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:53,650
Miss Goodwin

824
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:53,650
I have a patient,

825
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:53,650
an air traffic controller

826
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:55,690
who has a drinking problem.

827
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:57,720
Both she and her husband

828
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:57,720
refuse to admit it,

829
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,760
so, I am going

830
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,760
to inform the FAA.

831
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:01,090
I wanted to make you aware.

832
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,720
And you're certain

833
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,720
about this?

834
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:05,960
Yes. Uh, I didn't want

835
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:05,960
to believe it at first.

836
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:08,930
She's very convincing.

837
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:08,930
But it has been going on

838
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:08,930
for some time,

839
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:12,100
and clearly,

840
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:12,100
both she and her husband

841
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:12,100
are in denial.

842
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:16,740
I see.

843
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:16,740
Well, she's your patient.

844
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:16,740
It's your call.

845
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:22,010
I heard about Dr. Asher.

846
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:22,010
I'm sorry. How's she doing?

847
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:25,180
Yeah, better.

848
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:25,180
Thanks for asking.

849
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:29,780
But you know

850
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:29,780
I have no choice

851
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:29,780
but to report Dr. Asher.

852
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:32,650
I know.

853
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,520
And as to your patient,

854
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,560
I would encourage you

855
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,560
to make sure

856
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:42,030
there are no extenuating

857
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:42,030
circumstances

858
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:42,030
that you're not aware of.

859
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:45,270
Because once you make

860
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:45,270
the call to FAA,

861
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:48,200
this woman's career

862
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:48,200
is very likely over.

863
00:25:58,290 --> 00:25:59,840
Mrs. MacNeal?

864
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,920
Um...

865
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,960
This is bad, isn't it?

866
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:15,030
The doctors have reconsidered

867
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:15,030
your husband's treatment.

868
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:18,260
They don't feel ECMO

869
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:18,260
will change

870
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:18,260
the course of his illness.

871
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:20,560
Does that mean...

872
00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:24,870
I'm afraid, yes.

873
00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:24,870
You have to prepare yourself.

874
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:35,910
Can I be with him?

875
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:35,910
Hold his hand?

876
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:39,190
No. It would put you

877
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:39,190
at too much risk.

878
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,590
We've been married

879
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,590
for 40 years.

880
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:49,170
And now, he's going to die

881
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:49,170
without me by his side.

882
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:51,970
I wish I could change that,

883
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:53,300
but I can't.

884
00:26:54,610 --> 00:26:55,970
But he won't die alone.

885
00:26:57,140 --> 00:27:00,210
I will be there.

886
00:26:57,140 --> 00:27:00,210
I promise you.

887
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:03,270
I want you

888
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:03,270
to give him something.

889
00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:09,080
I just found this.

890
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:10,920
It was our first date.

891
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:24,000
I'll make sure he gets this.

892
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:34,910
Help! Somebody help.

893
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:34,910
She can't breathe.

894
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:40,120
Kellie? Kellie?

895
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:43,880
Hey, sweetheart. Look at me.

896
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:43,880
Look at me. I know

897
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:43,880
you're scared, all right?

898
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:47,330
I just need you to take slow,

899
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:47,330
deep breaths, okay?

900
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:47,330
Okay? There you go.

901
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:51,630
"S" Gallop is worse.

902
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:51,630
Let's get another echo

903
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:51,630
and chest X-ray.

904
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:53,170
What? What's happening?

905
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:58,800
Kellie's heart failure

906
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:58,800
is getting worse.

907
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:01,770
If we don't act now,

908
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:01,770
she may not be around

909
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:01,770
to fight the leukemia.

910
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,740
Oh, God. It's that bad?

911
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:08,040
You wanna operate?

912
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:08,040
Put in that LVAD?

913
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:08,040
That's right.

914
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:10,050
Dr. Manning,

915
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:10,050
you were against it before.

916
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:13,680
I have to agree

917
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:13,680
with Dr. Marcel now.

918
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:13,680
It's what's best for Kellie.

919
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:15,420
All right.

920
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:15,420
Do the surgery.

921
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,920
All right. Let's get

922
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,920
this girl upstairs.

923
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:19,320
Trini, page Dr. Latham

924
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:19,320
and tell him to meet me

925
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:19,320
in the OR.

926
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:25,330
Yeah.

927
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:28,960
You got a minute?

928
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,200
Yeah, sure.

929
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:35,300
Have a seat.

930
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,440
I wasn't being honest earlier.

931
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,840
Things haven't been good

932
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,840
with Hannah.

933
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:44,280
In fact, they've been

934
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:44,280
kind of a hell.

935
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:50,050
These last months,

936
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:50,050
if she was having a hard day

937
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:50,050
or we had a fight,

938
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,790
I was always afraid

939
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,790
she'd start using again.

940
00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:57,420
I was just constantly

941
00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:57,420
on eggshells,

942
00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:57,420
and, uh, she could tell.

943
00:28:57,730 --> 00:28:59,700
She blamed me

944
00:28:57,730 --> 00:28:59,700
for not trusting her.

945
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:04,730
And I see now,

946
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:04,730
that I blamed her

947
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:04,730
for being an addict.

948
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:06,970
Blame, resentment...

949
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:10,700
Tricky stuff, you know,

950
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:10,700
hard to let go of.

951
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:15,250
You were right, what you said

952
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:15,250
about addicts and romance,

953
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:18,950
that if the romance

954
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:18,950
goes south,

955
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:18,950
they'll likely turn to drugs.

956
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:21,150
You think that's maybe

957
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:21,150
what happened here?

958
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:26,420
Hannah and I got into

959
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:26,420
a huge fight yesterday.

960
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:28,960
I stormed out of the condo.

961
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:33,020
And next thing I know,

962
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:33,020
she's, uh, OD'd.

963
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:35,290
Oh, buddy, I'm sorry.

964
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:37,970
Yeah, that's not

965
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:37,970
the worst of it.

966
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,230
See,

967
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,300
I think I've been waiting

968
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,300
for it to happen.

969
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,080
Where are we at?

970
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:01,420
She's sobering up.

971
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:01,420
You wanna talk to her?

972
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,450
Not yet. This case

973
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,450
got too personal for me.

974
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:08,160
I need to do some research

975
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:08,160
and look into this more.

976
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:17,770
Hey.

977
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:18,870
Hey.

978
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:22,810
I just heard Kellie Lieu's

979
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:22,810
surgery went well.

980
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:22,810
Congratulations.

981
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,780
Yeah.

982
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,910
I was being

983
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,910
overly cautious.

984
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:29,520
I should've agreed

985
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:29,520
with the LVAD way sooner.

986
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:31,790
Well, not necessarily.

987
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:36,350
It was a risky procedure.

988
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:36,350
Could've easily gone

989
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:36,350
the other way.

990
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:44,170
You know, yesterday,

991
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:47,800
I moved out of my house.

992
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:51,200
I said goodbye to my son.

993
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:54,940
I have been thinking

994
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:54,940
about him all day,

995
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:59,110
wondering if I did

996
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:59,110
the right thing,

997
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:59,110
if he'll be okay.

998
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:03,120
I think those feelings

999
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:03,120
clouded my judgment today.

1000
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:13,060
You weren't wrong about me

1001
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:13,060
and kids with leukemia.

1002
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:17,570
Every time I see one,

1003
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:17,570
I think of my little girl.

1004
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:25,170
You know,

1005
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:25,170
we try to protect them

1006
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:25,170
as much as we can...

1007
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:30,440
...until that last moment,

1008
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:30,440
when we, uh, can't.

1009
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,560
Uh, all I'm saying is

1010
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,560
you're doing the right thing.

1011
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:47,930
Yeah.

1012
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:50,230
Owen will be okay.

1013
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:50,230
See you tomorrow.

1014
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:51,400
See you tomorrow.

1015
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:01,100
Now, what?

1016
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,880
I did some research

1017
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,880
and ordered one last test.

1018
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,210
I owe you an apology.

1019
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:10,150
We now know

1020
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:10,150
you have not been drinking.

1021
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:11,380
Finally.

1022
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:14,060
I gotta be honest with you,

1023
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:14,060
this is a first for me.

1024
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,460
You have a condition

1025
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,460
called auto-brewery syndrome.

1026
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:19,030
And because of it,

1027
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:19,030
the yeast in your gut

1028
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:21,600
turns certain carbohydrates

1029
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:21,600
into alcohol.

1030
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:23,590
You never even

1031
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:23,590
have to take a drink.

1032
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:25,300
Really?

1033
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:25,300
Yes.

1034
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:27,310
Why would this happen

1035
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:27,310
all of a sudden?

1036
00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:29,600
So, you said Anita

1037
00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:29,600
was on a paleo diet,

1038
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:32,110
very low carbs,

1039
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:32,110
but she stopped.

1040
00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:34,310
Yeah. I was hungry

1041
00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:34,310
all the time.

1042
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:36,510
We're not sure why

1043
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:36,510
some people react this way,

1044
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:39,140
but that's probably

1045
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:39,140
what triggered it.

1046
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:41,220
And if you cut out

1047
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:41,220
simple carbs

1048
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:41,220
from your diet,

1049
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,550
you should be fine.

1050
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:47,990
Maggie's gonna discharge you,

1051
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:47,990
so you can get out of here.

1052
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,390
Okay.

1053
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:56,230
Again, I'm sorry.

1054
00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:05,200
Hey.

1055
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:07,340
Hey.

1056
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:12,580
Look, um...

1057
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:16,550
You know, I've been thinking,

1058
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:20,680
when I get out of rehab,

1059
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:20,680
I wanna go somewhere.

1060
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,690
Away from here,

1061
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,690
get a fresh start.

1062
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,970
You wanna leave Med?

1063
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:31,460
Here, I'm just

1064
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:31,460
the addict doctor.

1065
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:31,460
I always will be.

1066
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:38,280
I was thinking LA.

1067
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:38,280
Decent weather for a change.

1068
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,350
I want you to come with me.

1069
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:47,680
Hannah,

1070
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:47,680
I'm not gonna do that.

1071
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:50,210
You don't have to decide

1072
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:50,210
right away, so...

1073
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,690
No, I'm not coming with you.

1074
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:01,560
I was afraid

1075
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:01,560
you'd say that.

1076
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,240
See, the thing is, Will,

1077
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,010
without you...

1078
00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:15,580
...I'm worried that, uh...

1079
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:20,480
I'm worried that

1080
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:20,480
I'll start using again.

1081
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,180
I love you.

1082
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:28,360
But I can't be the reason

1083
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:28,360
you stay sober.

1084
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:33,560
It's not good for you

1085
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:33,560
and, uh, it's not good for me.

1086
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,450
Who's gonna cut your hair?

1087
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:54,210
Who knows?

1088
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:59,390
Maybe in a year or so,

1089
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:59,390
you'll wanna

1090
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:59,390
come visit Disneyland.

1091
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:04,290
Yeah. Maybe I will.

1092
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:09,500
What?

1093
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:15,540
Hey, I picked up

1094
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:15,540
a little Thai.

1095
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:15,540
You, uh, hungry?

1096
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:22,710
I hadn't been

1097
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:22,710
out of the house

1098
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:22,710
in months.

1099
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:27,280
I was going crazy.

1100
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:27,280
I just wanted

1101
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:27,280
to see some friends.

1102
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:28,410
None of them were sick.

1103
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,390
Honey, I get it.

1104
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,390
I totally understand.

1105
00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:33,590
Jennifer had no idea

1106
00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:33,590
that she had it.

1107
00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:33,590
She felt completely fine.

1108
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:35,160
You know, sweetie,

1109
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:35,160
it's okay to feel bad.

1110
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:36,750
It's okay. I'm really glad

1111
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:36,750
that we're...

1112
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:39,630
Dad, of course I feel bad!

1113
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:39,630
I gave you COVID!

1114
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:42,430
That's why you're mad at me!

1115
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:45,200
I'm not mad at you.

1116
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:45,200
Yes, you are!

1117
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:48,400
You've been walking

1118
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:48,400
around the house

1119
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:48,400
acting like everything's fine,

1120
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:53,640
using that phony, calm voice,

1121
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:53,640
but clearly, it's not fine.

1122
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:55,150
Why aren't you yelling at me

1123
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:55,150
right now?

1124
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:56,480
Why would I yell at you?

1125
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:59,820
Because I screwed up!

1126
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:59,820
I could've killed you.

1127
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:15,830
I'm so sorry.

1128
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:20,500
Can you forgive me?

1129
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:23,700
Oh, sweetie, of course,

1130
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:23,700
I forgive you.

1131
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:23,700
Of course, I do.

1132
00:36:25,210 --> 00:36:28,650
And you know what?

1133
00:36:25,210 --> 00:36:28,650
I mean, I think you're right.

1134
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:31,340
I think I have been angry.

1135
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:34,850
And you know what?

1136
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:34,850
Maybe I should

1137
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:34,850
have told you,

1138
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:36,720
but I know you didn't do it

1139
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:36,720
on purpose.

1140
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:38,790
I didn't want

1141
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:38,790
to make you feel

1142
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:38,790
any worse.

1143
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:42,800
Here's the thing

1144
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:42,800
about your dad.

1145
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:48,730
I can be pretty good

1146
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:48,730
with other people's emotions,

1147
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:54,170
but sometimes, not so much

1148
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:54,170
when dealing with my own.

1149
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:00,400
Which is why

1150
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:00,400
I need you around.

1151
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:00,400
Keep me honest.

1152
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:09,950
The pad thai's

1153
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:09,950
probably getting

1154
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:09,950
cold by now.

1155
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,920
So you know

1156
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,920
I'm not coming home

1157
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,920
tonight, right?

1158
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:17,530
Yeah, I know.

1159
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:17,530
You're helping people.

1160
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:20,570
But I miss you

1161
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:20,570
and I love you very much.

1162
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:24,200
I love you, too.

1163
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:24,200
Nana and I

1164
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:24,200
are making cookies.

1165
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:26,800
Oh, yeah?

1166
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:26,800
What kind of cookies?

1167
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:28,370
Chocolate chip.

1168
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:30,240
Mmm.

1169
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:32,280
So, you're having fun

1170
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:32,280
with Nana?

1171
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:33,370
Yeah.

1172
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,510
Good.

1173
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,510
I'm glad to hear that.

1174
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:37,280
I'm gonna go, now.

1175
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,280
Oh, okay.

1176
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:40,580
Bye, Mom.

1177
00:37:40,690 --> 00:37:42,350
Bye, sweetheart.

1178
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:02,500
BP 55/38. Sats at 60.

1179
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:02,500
Maxed on pressors.

1180
00:38:03,610 --> 00:38:05,410
He's in

1181
00:38:03,610 --> 00:38:05,410
multi-organ failure.

1182
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:07,540
We've exhausted

1183
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:07,540
our options, April.

1184
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:09,240
Turn up his morphine?

1185
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:11,480
Yeah. And contact his wife.

1186
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:25,920
April?

1187
00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:27,960
Hi. Um...

1188
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:30,770
I'm afraid it's his time.

1189
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:35,370
Let me see him.

1190
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:44,310
Fred?

1191
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:46,850
Freddie?

1192
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,390
I love you, honey.

1193
00:38:57,530 --> 00:39:01,870
And I'll miss you every day,

1194
00:38:57,530 --> 00:39:01,870
for the rest of my life.

1195
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:04,840
But then I'll see you again.

1196
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:09,700
And we'll be together...

1197
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:11,570
...forever.

1198
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:23,420
I'm so sorry.

1199
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:24,890
No.

1200
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,640
Another week.

1201
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:48,770
We remember those gone.

1202
00:39:49,850 --> 00:39:51,110
Let's share their names.

1203
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:05,730

1204
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:08,590
