1
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:08,200
I can't find the artery.

2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:08,200
I can't find it.

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:09,500
Dean, you can do this!

4
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:12,040
Dr. Charles helped me.

5
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:12,040
And he can help you, too.

6
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:14,440
PTSD just doesn't

7
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:14,440
go away, Dean.

8
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:14,440
I don't need therapy.

9
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:18,410
I have a daughter, Vanessa.

10
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:20,140
I found out that she was

11
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:20,140
in medical school and...

12
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:23,190
So, you don't intend

13
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:23,190
to see her again?

14
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:23,190
Of course I want to.

15
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:25,190
Yeah, what was your

16
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:25,190
impression of her?

17
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:25,190
Good candidate.

18
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:27,520
It'd be great to get her.

19
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:30,030
The medication

20
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:30,030
was supposed to be

21
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:30,030
sent back to Kender.

22
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:32,320
Package for Kender?

23
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:32,320
Someone already

24
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:32,320
picked that up.

25
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:34,160
Is it even that

26
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:34,160
big of a deal, though?

27
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:37,490
I'm gonna have to find them,

28
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:37,490
one way or another.

29
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:43,660
Welcome, and congratulations.

30
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:43,660
You've all done well enough

31
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:43,660
to get this far.

32
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:46,070
But this ED only accepts

33
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:46,070
one med student a year

34
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:47,200
from this audition,

35
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:50,470
so, these next few weeks

36
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:50,470
are your one and only

37
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:50,470
opportunity to impress.

38
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:51,570
No pressure.

39
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:55,210
Now, you're new,

40
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:55,210
so I'm expecting

41
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:55,210
some mistakes.

42
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,510
But I'm also

43
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,510
expecting you

44
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:57,780
to display the confidence

45
00:00:58,090 --> 00:00:59,280
to push through

46
00:00:58,090 --> 00:00:59,280
those mistakes.

47
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:00,750
And if some of the nurses

48
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:03,120
take a liking to you,

49
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:04,630
that wouldn't hurt, either.

50
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:08,260
So, which one of them

51
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:08,260
are you so keen on?

52
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,420
Huh?

53
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:12,660
The student application

54
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:12,660
that you asked me to move

55
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:12,660
to the top of the pile?

56
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:16,400
Vanessa Taylor?

57
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:16,400
That's her right there.

58
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:19,670
Ah. How do you know her?

59
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:19,670
Friend of the family?

60
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:23,300
No, she... Residency fair.

61
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:23,300
She just stood out.

62
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:27,350
Maggie? Hi. I'm not sure

63
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:27,350
if you remember me or not,

64
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:27,350
but...

65
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:29,150
I do. You led me

66
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:29,150
to Beecher Hall.

67
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:31,350
And you played the Scarecrow

68
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:31,350
in middle school.

69
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:33,350
Scarecrow?

70
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:33,350
Good memory.

71
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:34,550
Vanessa Taylor,

72
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:34,550
this is...

73
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:35,720
Sharon Goodwin.

74
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:38,320
I was up last night

75
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:38,320
doing research,

76
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:38,320
'cause I couldn't sleep.

77
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:40,230
I'm a bit excited,

78
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:40,230
if you can't tell.

79
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:42,060
Pleased to meet you,

80
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:42,060
Miss Taylor.

81
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,100
Yeah. I should get back

82
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,100
to the group,

83
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,190
but thank you both

84
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,190
for this opportunity.

85
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:49,270
She's a go-getter.

86
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:54,740
Good morning.

87
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:54,740
Morning.

88
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,280
Oh. Hey, Dean, you wanna

89
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,280
grab lunch today?

90
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:59,810
Wednesday is Reuben day.

91
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,180
This wouldn't happen

92
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,180
to be your subtle attempt

93
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,680
to sit me down

94
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,580
for one of your casual

95
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,580
check-ins, would it?

96
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:07,380
Busted.

97
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:07,380
Yeah.

98
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:09,250
I'll tell you what.

99
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:09,250
You have my full permission

100
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,290
to tell Dr. Choi

101
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,290
that we spoke,

102
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,290
if it gets him off your back.

103
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:15,520
Everybody who works here

104
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:15,520
has gotta do this,

105
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:15,520
including Dr. Choi.

106
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:17,290
It's no big deal.

107
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:17,290
It'll take five minutes.

108
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,390
We can talk about gardening,

109
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,390
if you want. I gotta

110
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,390
cross you off my list.

111
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,290
Thing is, I've found that

112
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,290
what works best for me

113
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:27,270
is when I steal away

114
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:27,270
for some quiet,

115
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:27,270
personal time every day.

116
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:28,810
Unfortunately, I've found

117
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:34,110
that the only time I have

118
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:34,110
for that is my lunch hour.

119
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:34,110
You understand.

120
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,580
I am gonna have to

121
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,580
pin you down,

122
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:37,780
or Goodwin's

123
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:37,780
gonna get mad at me.

124
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:39,680
They're playing

125
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:39,680
my song. I gotta...

126
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:44,750
Treatment Four.

127
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,490
Neil Dietrich, 24.

128
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,830
Collapsed at the park

129
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,830
with severe abdominal pains.

130
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:50,400
Wouldn't let us

131
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:50,400
take his vitals,

132
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,870
but we were able

133
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,870
to get a saliva swab.

134
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,870
COVID negative.

135
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:54,500
What's going on, Neil?

136
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,830
It's just

137
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,830
a stomach ache, okay?

138
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:58,630
Whatever is wrong with me

139
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:58,630
will go away on its own.

140
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:01,680
I don't know. Maybe you should

141
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:01,680
give us professionals a shot.

142
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:04,140
One, two, three. Okay.

143
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:05,510
This isn't necessary.

144
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:11,340
Stop. Leave me alone.

145
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:12,680
A hundred-point-nine.

146
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:14,550
You have

147
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:14,550
a fever, Neil.

148
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:16,590
Your body's way

149
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:16,590
of telling us

150
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:16,590
something's wrong.

151
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:18,250
Yeah, I'll be fine.

152
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:18,250
Hmm.

153
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,590
And that pain you're

154
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,590
experiencing, I can make

155
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,590
that go away, easy.

156
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:25,230
A little morphine

157
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:25,230
will have you feeling like

158
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:25,230
it's a day at the spa.

159
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,700
Please, just leave me alone!

160
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,500
Okay. If you won't let us

161
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,500
treat you, maybe there's

162
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,500
something else we can do?

163
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:33,900
No. Nothing you can do

164
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:33,900
will matter.

165
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,340
How could you believe that

166
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,340
nothing we do will matter?

167
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,340
Nothing?

168
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,580
Because...

169
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,580
Because?

170
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,880
Come on, Neil. Level with me.

171
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,880
I can take it.

172
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:46,210
Because none of this is real,

173
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:46,210
okay? It's just a computer

174
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:46,210
simulation.

175
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,770
It's obvious,

176
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:07,270
every facet of our lives

177
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:07,270
has been pre-programmed.

178
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,910
The richest 1% of the world

179
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:12,450
owns 99% of basically

180
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:12,450
everything.

181
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:13,740
How's that possible?

182
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:15,340
Excellent question.

183
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,450
Where does it hurt, Neil?

184
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,450
I'll be fine.

185
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:24,390
It's possible because

186
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:24,390
the game is rigged.

187
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:24,390
Right.

188
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:27,000
And who exactly

189
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:27,000
is playing the game?

190
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,700
All real people are players,

191
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,700
they have no choice.

192
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,730
Obviously, there's some form

193
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,730
of higher intelligence.

194
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:33,560
They created

195
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:33,560
this simulation

196
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:33,560
for a reason.

197
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:35,240
Which is?

198
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:36,770
That's what

199
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:36,770
I'm trying to find out.

200
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:39,430
Clearly, some part of it is to

201
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:39,430
keep real people compliant.

202
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:41,980
Right. Are you a real person?

203
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,800
The real question is

204
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,800
are you a real person

205
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:47,010
or are you an NPC?

206
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,510
What's that?

207
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:49,950
A non-player character.

208
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:51,380
A computer construct

209
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:52,750
to maintain the order

210
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:52,750
of the simulation.

211
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:56,880
Despite our different

212
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:56,880
beliefs, we can all agree

213
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:56,880
that with the fever

214
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:59,690
and the intermittent

215
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:59,690
stabbing pain,

216
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:59,690
that you are unwell.

217
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,590
And now's a good time

218
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,590
to do something about that.

219
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,690
No. I'm sorry. I'm not gonna

220
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,690
change my mind on this.

221
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,360
Neil,

222
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,360
let's say you're right.

223
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:09,870
What I don't understand is

224
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:09,870
that your pain is obviously

225
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:09,870
very real to you.

226
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:13,270
And all we're trying

227
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:13,270
to do is figure out

228
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:13,270
what's causing it.

229
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,370
You don't wanna

230
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,370
let us do that?

231
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,370
No.

232
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,380
Because you'd reverse

233
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,380
the effects of the red pill.

234
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:18,910
The red pill?

235
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,910
There's this red pill you take

236
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,910
that initiates the process

237
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:25,820
of waking you up

238
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:25,820
outside of the simulation.

239
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,550
So, you took

240
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,550
one of these red pills?

241
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,550
Yeah, thankfully.

242
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,890
Whatever you ingested

243
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,890
might be making you sick.

244
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:35,860
Yeah, see,

245
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:35,860
that's exactly what

246
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:35,860
an NPC would say.

247
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,370
But you're right.

248
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,370
Whatever I'm feeling

249
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,370
right now,

250
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,690
it's probably the red pill

251
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,690
starting to work.

252
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,400
If that's what it takes to

253
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,400
wake up in the real world,

254
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,400
so be it.

255
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:49,510
How much longer do I

256
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:49,510
have to stay here?

257
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,670
Um, give Dr. Archer and I

258
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,670
a couple minutes,

259
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,410
and we'll be right back.

260
00:05:56,890 --> 00:06:00,380
Well, if he hasn't poisoned

261
00:05:56,890 --> 00:06:00,380
himself with whatever he took,

262
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:01,850
he probably has appendicitis.

263
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,090
Yeah. Look, there's

264
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,090
always a psych hold.

265
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:05,690
It'll antagonize him,

266
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:07,490
and we'll never find out

267
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:07,490
what he took.

268
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,860
Slow roll

269
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,860
the paperwork a bit.

270
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,990
Yeah, all right.

271
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:12,660
I wanna study up on this whole

272
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:12,660
simulation thing a bit,

273
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:14,500
see if I can get in

274
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:14,500
better sync with his logic.

275
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,940
Logic? He thinks we're living

276
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,940
in a computer game.

277
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,870
Hopefully, we'll dispel him

278
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,870
of that notion.

279
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:19,960
All right.

280
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,040
It's called the emergency room

281
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,040
for a reason.

282
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:24,370
Working fast is key,

283
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,810
but not at the expense

284
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,810
of working smart.

285
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:28,710
If you can do both,

286
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:28,710
that's what we're looking for.

287
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:31,580
Good morning, Ms. Royko.

288
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:33,050
Our patient is 62 years old,

289
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:34,680
experiencing a persistent

290
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:34,680
headache,

291
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:37,020
blurry vision, and has

292
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:37,020
a known history of diabetes.

293
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:39,120
All right.

294
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:39,120
What's your differential?

295
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:40,490
I suspect hypertension.

296
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,590
Do we know her BP yet?

297
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:43,900
226/115.

298
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,660
That would qualify

299
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,660
as hypertension.

300
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:47,130
What would your course

301
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:47,130
of treatment be?

302
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,430
I'd push ten of hydralazine.

303
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,430
Well done.

304
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:52,040
Doris, push ten

305
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:52,040
of hydralazine,

306
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:56,040
as recommended

307
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:56,040
by Student Dr. Mims here.

308
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:56,040
Excuse us.

309
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,440
Moving on.

310
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,650
Vanessa, hey. I couldn't help

311
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,650
but notice, it seemed like

312
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,650
you had the answer yourself.

313
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:06,520
Obviously,

314
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:06,520
she has hypertension.

315
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,950
I raised my hand.

316
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,950
I just didn't get called on.

317
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:11,860
Frankly, I think Cardizem

318
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:11,860
would be better

319
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:11,860
than hydralazine.

320
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,050
If I may,

321
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,050
a word of advice,

322
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,560
it wouldn't hurt

323
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,560
to assert yourself

324
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,560
a bit more.

325
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:19,900
Student Dr. Taylor,

326
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:19,900
you with us or not?

327
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:25,600
Maggie?

328
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:25,600
We need a room!

329
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:26,900
What's going on with your mom?

330
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:29,880
She's been passing out

331
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:29,880
intermittently,

332
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:29,880
started before breakfast.

333
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:32,780
What's Maggie

334
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:32,780
doing here? What?

335
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,680
Carol, we're gonna

336
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,680
take good care of you.

337
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,680
Herbert?

338
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,650
Yeah.

339
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,650
Go ahead.

340
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:39,050
I'll call the cardiologist,

341
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:39,050
tell them to come down.

342
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:41,990
No, Nat? I'm gonna

343
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:41,990
page Dr. Young.

344
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:41,990
You go be with your mom.

345
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,560
Will? What are you

346
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,560
doing in here?

347
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,560
What do you mean?

348
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:50,000
I'm up.

349
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:50,000
And it's your mother.

350
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:52,160
She's having

351
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:52,160
syncopal episodes?

352
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:56,630
Yeah. I think it might have

353
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:56,630
something to do with the LVAD.

354
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:59,540
Okay. Her lungs are clear,

355
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:59,540
so that's a good sign.

356
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:02,000
But your extremities

357
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:02,000
are super cold, Carol.

358
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:03,840
I know.

359
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:03,840
Let's do an EKG.

360
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:05,940
Hmm.

361
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,080
Thank you

362
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,080
for stepping in,

363
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:12,480
but I've paged Dr. Young

364
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:12,480
and I think that we can

365
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:12,480
manage until they come down.

366
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,710
Please don't go.

367
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:17,490
I'm really scared, Will.

368
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:17,490
Could you stay, please?

369
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:19,720
I'm not going

370
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:19,720
anywhere, Carol.

371
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:19,720
Mom...

372
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:20,890
Okay. Okay.

373
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:20,890
I promise.

374
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,620
We'll just get some

375
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,620
preliminary tests going.

376
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:25,720
Give Dr. Young

377
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:25,720
a head start.

378
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:25,720
All right.

379
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:27,960
I'll run a panel.

380
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:27,960
Remind me again,

381
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:27,960
what medications she's on?

382
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:29,860
What?

383
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:32,160
I assume

384
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:32,160
she's on a beta blocker?

385
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:39,010
Uh, yes. Metoprolol,

386
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:39,010
25mg, twice daily.

387
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:43,050
Plus, Lasix, the same,

388
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:43,050
and, um, Rosuvastatin,

389
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:45,920
I believe it's 10mg

390
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:45,920
once a day.

391
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:45,920
Okay.

392
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:50,690
And don't forget about

393
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:50,690
that, um,

394
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:50,690
new pill you gave me.

395
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:52,730
The one that's supposed

396
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:52,730
to help my heart pump.

397
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:54,490
New one?

398
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,760
Yes. I put her

399
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,760
on a fish oil supplement,

400
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,760
that's all.

401
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,670
Okay.

402
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,670
No, it's a little blue pill.

403
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,200
I'll show it to you.

404
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,200
It's in my bag.

405
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:06,100
No, no, no. Mom,

406
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:06,100
your bag is in the car.

407
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:07,680
I'll just go get it.

408
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,010
No, Mom,

409
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,010
you don't need it.

410
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:10,840
I need the stuff

411
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:10,840
that's in there.

412
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,110
Okay, Mom,

413
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:15,080
I have to go move the car.

414
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:15,080
I'll bring it in.

415
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:15,080
I'll be right back.

416
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,150
All right.

417
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,150
Okay.

418
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,920
You're each gonna be

419
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,920
working one-on-one

420
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,920
with the attendings.

421
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:02,730
Dr. Driskell here will have

422
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:02,730
your assignments. Follow him.

423
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,060
Taylor.

424
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,060
Yes, sir?

425
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:06,630
You start with me.

426
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:13,900
You can't go on

427
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:13,900
like this, Neil.

428
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,240
I have to. It's the only way

429
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,240
to see what real life is.

430
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:20,940
Oh, good. No red pill.

431
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,820
Neil, are you familiar

432
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,820
with the butterfly dream?

433
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,290
The Chinese philosopher

434
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,290
who dreamt

435
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,290
he was a butterfly...

436
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:28,790
Yeah. Only he woke up

437
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:31,360
only to question

438
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:31,360
whether or not he was

439
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:31,360
the butterfly or the man.

440
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:34,130
Right.

441
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:34,130
But you're not

442
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:34,130
gonna convince me

443
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:36,700
I'm wrong 'cause there

444
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:36,700
have been other philosophies

445
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,860
about hypothetical

446
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,860
simulations.

447
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,370
But what struck me is,

448
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,370
he did wake up.

449
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:46,070
Right? And then was able

450
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:46,070
to acknowledge that one of

451
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:46,070
those experiences was reality.

452
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:48,170
Right?

453
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:48,170
You're making my point. Okay?

454
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:51,680
I'm trying to wake up.

455
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:51,680
That's my goal.

456
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:52,770
I know what I'm doing.

457
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:55,120
I've heard

458
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:55,120
that before.

459
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:59,680
So, a few years back

460
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:59,680
in Afghanistan,

461
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:06,160
I was working alongside this

462
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:06,160
joint task force hunting down

463
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:06,160
Taliban extremists.

464
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:10,890
Now, let me tell you, we saw

465
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:10,890
some pretty gnarly stuff that

466
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:10,890
you would not believe.

467
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:16,240
And these soldiers,

468
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:16,240
they didn't come any tougher.

469
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:19,270
When they had a mission,

470
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:19,270
that was all that mattered.

471
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:23,680
Even with the worst injuries,

472
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:23,680
they would not be deterred.

473
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:25,010
I get that.

474
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:26,850
I know you do.

475
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:32,940
But sometimes, those same

476
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:32,940
injuries that they ignored

477
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:32,940
ended up killing them.

478
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:35,760
These were

479
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:35,760
preventable deaths.

480
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:38,730
And I do not

481
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:38,730
wanna see that

482
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:38,730
happening to you, Neil.

483
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:43,290
You don't seem to understand.

484
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:43,290
Okay? I can handle death.

485
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:43,290
I have to die to live.

486
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:48,130
Having witnessed

487
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:48,130
that firsthand,

488
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:48,130
that is patently untrue.

489
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:53,330
Look, it's just whatever

490
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:53,330
you think you saw over there,

491
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,270
none of that

492
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,270
actually happened.

493
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:58,010
You just think

494
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:58,010
that it did.

495
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:59,710
Okay.

496
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:59,710
It's part of the game.

497
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:01,280
All right.

498
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:07,880
I told you not to touch me!

499
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:09,290
Hey, no, I'm sorry, sorry.

500
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:11,880
I wanted to find out

501
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:11,880
where you're most sensitive.

502
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:11,880
That's all.

503
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:13,430
Dr. Charles.

504
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:13,430
A word, please?

505
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:22,770
All right. He's guarding

506
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:22,770
his lower right quadrant.

507
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:25,810
He has appendicitis.

508
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:25,810
I've seen this

509
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:25,810
100 times, all right?

510
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:28,210
If we don't do

511
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:28,210
anything about it,

512
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:28,210
his appendix will rupture,

513
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:31,040
and if that happens,

514
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:31,040
his life is gonna be

515
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:31,040
in jeopardy.

516
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:34,050
Yeah, I'm aware of what

517
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:34,050
a ruptured appendix means.

518
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:36,410
But why did you palpate him?

519
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,490
He wouldn't let me

520
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,490
come near him, otherwise.

521
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:40,950
I needed to get a read

522
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:40,950
on him. He's not even

523
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:40,950
gonna get a scan.

524
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,120
I completely get

525
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,120
how upsetting it must be

526
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:46,220
to hear

527
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:46,220
your military experience

528
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:46,220
characterized that way.

529
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:47,990
But, Dean,

530
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:47,990
this guy's delusional.

531
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:50,500
You misread

532
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:50,500
the moment, Dr. Charles.

533
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,820
I don't blame you

534
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,820
for thinking

535
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,820
that's what you saw.

536
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:54,770
But I was honestly

537
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:54,770
trying to make a diagnosis.

538
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:56,030
And now, that I have,

539
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:59,070
it's time for you

540
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:59,070
to get a court order,

541
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:59,070
so we can force treatment.

542
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:03,980
You know, if and when

543
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:03,980
I determine that the patient

544
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:03,980
lacks decisional capacity,

545
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,240
I'll absolutely reach out

546
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,240
to a judge.

547
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:07,110
If? Are you kidding me?

548
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,380
This guy's a box

549
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,380
of loose screws.

550
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,280
No. Actually,

551
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,280
he's a patient.

552
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:17,080
Where are they taking me?

553
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:18,520
To get an echo, Carol.

554
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:18,520
Okay.

555
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:22,260
A transthoracic echocardiogram

556
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:22,260
will show us exactly how your

557
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:22,260
heart pumps.

558
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,770
This could be because

559
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,770
of the LVAD, right?

560
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,770
We'll see.

561
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,430
Mom, it's a really

562
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,430
simple procedure.

563
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,770
I'll be right here

564
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,770
when you get out.

565
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:32,170
Okay? I love you.

566
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,790
Hey.

567
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,550
Sorry, didn't mean

568
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,550
to startle you.

569
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,550
Hi.

570
00:13:56,930 --> 00:14:00,560
No, it's okay.

571
00:13:56,930 --> 00:14:00,560
I've been

572
00:13:56,930 --> 00:14:00,560
a little on edge today.

573
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:02,930
Yeah, I saw your mom

574
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:02,930
was here.

575
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,370
Yeah. Dr. Young

576
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,370
still doesn't know

577
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,370
what's going on,

578
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:09,140
but something's affecting

579
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:09,140
her circulation enough to

580
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:09,140
cause her to pass out.

581
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:12,510
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

582
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:12,510
Yeah. She's up

583
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:12,510
for an echo now.

584
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:15,880
So, we should know more soon.

585
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:19,220
Well, hope the echo brings

586
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:19,220
some good news.

587
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,340
Thank you.

588
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,820
See you.

589
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:34,140
Hey, Doris.

590
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:34,140
What's going on in there?

591
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:37,500
We got a drug addict in there

592
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:37,500
whose veins are shot to hell.

593
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:39,970
Can't get a peripheral in.

594
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:39,970
Ethan's asking for a...

595
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:41,270
Triple lumen kit?

596
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:41,270
Yeah.

597
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,210
Here you go.

598
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,210
Thanks.

599
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:47,270
Listen, I'm feeling

600
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:47,270
a little restless

601
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:47,270
just directing traffic.

602
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:49,610
I got an itch

603
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:49,610
to slip on the gloves.

604
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,480
How about you and me

605
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,480
swap places for the day?

606
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:53,250
I get to hold the brick?

607
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,120
Thank you.

608
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:01,290
Here you go, Dr. Choi.

609
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:03,250
What happened to Doris?

610
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,860
You got me instead.

611
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,860
You disappointed?

612
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:10,100
Never. So, you ever

613
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:10,100
insert a central line?

614
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,930
Plenty of times

615
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,930
in med school, yes, sir.

616
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:15,280
Show me what you got, then.

617
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:19,510
All right, Shawn. We're gonna

618
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:19,510
get you prepped for this.

619
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:25,450
Pull down your gown.

620
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:31,930
Lidocaine?

621
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:34,260
Yes, of course.

622
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:34,260
Thank you, Maggie.

623
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:40,560
Ethan? Goodwin's requesting

624
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:40,560
your presence at the 2:30

625
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:40,560
budget meeting.

626
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:43,070
All right, I'll be

627
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:43,070
right there.

628
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:43,070
Yeah.

629
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:44,160
Taylor?

630
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:47,100
You think you can

631
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:47,100
handle this yourself?

632
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:53,240
Yes, of course, Dr. Choi.

633
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:53,240
I'm confident I can

634
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:53,240
do this on my own.

635
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:56,180
I've assisted a million.

636
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:56,180
I got her back.

637
00:15:56,450 --> 00:16:00,650
Great. Any problems,

638
00:15:56,450 --> 00:16:00,650
you notify an attending.

639
00:15:56,450 --> 00:16:00,650
I'll be back in a bit.

640
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:07,420
Crockett, you're up.

641
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:07,420
Yeah? Okay.

642
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,990
Cesar, Baghdad.

643
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,990
What've we got?

644
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:13,430
Edgar Fuentes, 25,

645
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:13,430
took a GSW to

646
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:13,430
the leg in a drive-by.

647
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:15,070
Vitals are stable.

648
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:17,300
Applied a pressure dressing

649
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:17,300
en route.

650
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:17,300
Bleeding's controlled.

651
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:18,960
Mr. Fuentes,

652
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:18,960
I'm Dr. Marcel.

653
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:20,340
I'll be taking care

654
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:20,340
of you, okay?

655
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,970
This hurts like hell!

656
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,970
Yeah.

657
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:25,010
He was working on the car

658
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:25,010
out front. He wasn't even

659
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:25,010
doing anything!

660
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:27,050
Right.

661
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:27,050
My wife, Rosa,

662
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:27,050
our baby, Ada.

663
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:29,080
I'm sorry we all

664
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:29,080
had to meet this way.

665
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:33,050
Okay, folks, on me.

666
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:33,050
Ready, set, lift.

667
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:35,660
Nice and easy, you're okay.

668
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:35,660
Can you wiggle

669
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:35,660
your toes for me?

670
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,730
Yeah, but hurts.

671
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:45,120
You got two wounds,

672
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:45,120
lateral thigh,

673
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:45,120
nowhere near the blood vessel.

674
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:48,170
Probably through and through,

675
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:48,170
but let's get an X-ray

676
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:48,170
to prove it.

677
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:49,360
And 50 of fentanyl, please.

678
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:52,170
You're gonna be okay,

679
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:52,170
Mr. Fuentes.

680
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:54,970
Come here.

681
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,740
He's gonna be okay.

682
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,740
It's just a flesh wound,

683
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,740
all right?

684
00:16:58,050 --> 00:16:59,140
It looked so much worse.

685
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:00,680
We're gonna get an X-ray

686
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:00,680
just to be sure.

687
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:02,150
Oh, my God.

688
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,380
Is she okay?

689
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,380
Huh? Huh?

690
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:07,180
Your baby, is she okay?

691
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,050
Ada?

692
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,280
May I?

693
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,150
What? What...

694
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:19,190
Wait...

695
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:19,190
Hey, sweetheart.

696
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,130
What is that?

697
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,130
Your baby's been shot.

698
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,570
What?

699
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,570
I need help in here!

700
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:31,010
What? Oh, my God! No!

701
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:38,190
Yep. There's the bullet.

702
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:42,190
Pressure's still low.

703
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:43,490
Want me to hang

704
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:43,490
another unit?

705
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:45,620
No, let's do it up in the OR.

706
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:45,620
Let's move now.

707
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,560
I heard the gunfire, but I

708
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,560
didn't hear a window break.

709
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,660
It could've come

710
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,660
through the wall.

711
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,660
I've seen it before.

712
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:53,390
She was bundled up.

713
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:53,390
She seemed fine,

714
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:53,390
she wasn't bleeding...

715
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,660
The pressure from the swaddle

716
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,660
probably stopped the flow

717
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,660
of blood.

718
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:59,470
How could I not have noticed?

719
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:59,470
You didn't do

720
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:59,470
anything wrong.

721
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:02,640
Look, I'm gonna do

722
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:02,640
everything in my power

723
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:02,640
to save your baby's life.

724
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,630
All right, let's go.

725
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:13,510
Put back pressure

726
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:13,510
on the syringe

727
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:18,230
and walk the needle

728
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:18,230
down the clavicle,

729
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:18,230
until you hit the vein.

730
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:21,060
I lost the vacuum.

731
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:21,060
It's just filled with air.

732
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:22,560
I must have hit the lung.

733
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:24,690
We'll worry

734
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:24,690
about that later.

735
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,290
We still have

736
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,290
a line to put in.

737
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:31,670
Now, pull the needle back,

738
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:31,670
and eject the air.

739
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,750
Now, try again

740
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,750
until you find the vein.

741
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:41,410
Wait a minute.

742
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:41,410
What's going on?

743
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,080
It's okay, Shawn.

744
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,080
We're working on it.

745
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,210
Go ahead.

746
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,790
All right,

747
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,790
I'm drawing blood.

748
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:58,130
Perfect. Well done.

749
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:01,260
What about the lung?

750
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:01,260
I should go tell Dr. Choi.

751
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:03,600
Let's just finish

752
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:03,600
the procedure, okay?

753
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:08,570
So, physically,

754
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:08,570
there's something

755
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:08,570
very wrong with you.

756
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:12,150
By all indications,

757
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:12,150
your appendix

758
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:12,150
is about to burst.

759
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:15,480
So, what I'm asking is

760
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:15,480
if you would please

761
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:15,480
just let us do a scan.

762
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:18,520
I'm not getting a scan, okay?

763
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:18,520
No matter what it would show,

764
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:22,650
it's just the simulation's

765
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:22,650
explanation of what

766
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:22,650
the red pill is doing.

767
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:25,820
Neil, I respect

768
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:25,820
your point of view.

769
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:29,660
But you need to understand

770
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:29,660
that my reality

771
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:29,660
is that I'm a doctor,

772
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,260
and I can't just let you die.

773
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:35,760
Which is why I'm seriously

774
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:35,760
considering going to talk

775
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:35,760
to a judge this afternoon

776
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:38,670
about taking away

777
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:38,670
your ability to make your

778
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:38,670
own medical decisions.

779
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,140
What? Because you think

780
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,140
I'm delusional? Of course

781
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,140
you would think that.

782
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:45,140
That's actually

783
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:45,140
not what I said.

784
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,180
Can I ask you something?

785
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:49,910
Why is it that my belief

786
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:49,910
is the one being questioned?

787
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:58,450
Hey. I'm sorry to pull you

788
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:58,450
out of your meeting,

789
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:58,450
but it's important.

790
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,550
What's going on?

791
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:01,790
I have

792
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:01,790
an appendicitis patient

793
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:01,790
who's refusing treatment

794
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:05,590
because he believes

795
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:05,590
that we're living

796
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:05,590
in a computer simulation.

797
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:08,230
A what?

798
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:08,230
Yeah, I know.

799
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:08,230
It's... He's nuts.

800
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:09,630
Just page Dr. Charles.

801
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:11,800
No. See, Dr. Charles

802
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:11,800
is the problem.

803
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:14,810
He's dragging his heels

804
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:14,810
on forcing the treatment

805
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:14,810
that the guy needs.

806
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:17,880
Is it emergent?

807
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:17,880
I believe it is, yeah.

808
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:20,550
All right. What can I do?

809
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:20,550
I want you to weigh in.

810
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:23,910
With another sensible voice

811
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:23,910
in the room, maybe the two

812
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:23,910
of ours can drown his out.

813
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:28,390
I'll take a look, but I can't

814
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:28,390
imagine double doc-ing

815
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:28,390
Dr. Charles

816
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:30,220
on a decisional

817
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:30,220
capacity ruling.

818
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,520
Uh-huh. You know what?

819
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,520
Forget it.

820
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:34,820
'Cause I'm not interested

821
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:34,820
in having a courtesy consult.

822
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:37,830
Hey, Dean, I know how

823
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:37,830
frustrating it is

824
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:37,830
to be in your position...

825
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,870
I've butted heads

826
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,870
with Dr. Charles on this

827
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,870
same issue in the past.

828
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:43,230
Oh, yet, now,

829
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:43,230
you sit on your hands?

830
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:46,200
Watch it, Dean.

831
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,280
You're right. You're right,

832
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,280
uh, that was over the line.

833
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:55,540
All clear.

834
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:02,680
Just like I thought.

835
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:02,680
There's a pneumothorax.

836
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:04,520
This happens all the time.

837
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:05,990
Even to the most

838
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:05,990
seasoned doctors.

839
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:07,320
It happened

840
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:07,320
to Ethan last week.

841
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:08,860
Don't beat yourself up.

842
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,460
I'll go find Dr. Choi.

843
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:13,900
Or, you can

844
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:13,900
fix it yourself.

845
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:16,340
Insert a chest tube?

846
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,500
Mmm-hmm. You're comfortable

847
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,500
doing that, right?

848
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:21,680
Sure, but I...

849
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,640
Listen, Vanessa,

850
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,640
everyone makes mistakes.

851
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:26,810
But this way,

852
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:26,810
you can show Dr. Choi

853
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,780
that you know

854
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,780
how to correct yours

855
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,780
on your own.

856
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,250
I don't know.

857
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:36,320
If you want to win

858
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:36,320
a permanent spot in this ED,

859
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:37,690
this is how you do it.

860
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:41,330
All right.

861
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:41,330
Yeah, let's do it.

862
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:45,900
Hey, Shawn?

863
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:50,000
It appears that

864
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:50,000
when we did the procedure,

865
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:50,000
we hit your lung.

866
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:53,640
It's nothing serious.

867
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:53,640
But in order to fix

868
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:53,640
the problem,

869
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:57,410
we're gonna have to put

870
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:57,410
a tube in your chest

871
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:57,410
and we need your consent.

872
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,870
Is it necessary?

873
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,870
Unfortunately, it is.

874
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:03,770
But we're gonna numb you up,

875
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:03,770
give you a bit more sedation,

876
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:04,940
and you'll hardly

877
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:04,940
feel anything.

878
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:07,350
Okay.

879
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:07,350
All right.

880
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:12,890
You lay back and relax.

881
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:21,390
How'd it go?

882
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:21,390
No luck.

883
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,700
No CT. Okay.

884
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:41,550
Nurse Sexton!

885
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:46,460
Yes?

886
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:49,960
He's not protecting

887
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:49,960
his airway, I need to

888
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:49,960
intubate him. Get a line.

889
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,400
Order a CT, call the OR.

890
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,770
Make sure they have

891
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,770
a room open

892
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:58,570
in case we need

893
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:58,570
to bring him up for surgery.

894
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:01,880
Wait. Didn't Neil say that

895
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:01,880
he didn't want to be treated?

896
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:04,540
He did, but now,

897
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:04,540
he's unconscious.

898
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:06,700
You're just gonna disregard

899
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:06,700
what he wanted?

900
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:09,350
When a patient

901
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:09,350
is no longer able to

902
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:09,350
make medical decisions,

903
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:10,780
and there's no one

904
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:10,780
to stand up for them,

905
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:13,680
the hospital assumes

906
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:13,680
power of attorney.

907
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:17,090
Twenty of etomidate,

908
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:17,090
100 of sux.

909
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,520
Should I not intubate him?

910
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,520
He doesn't have a DNI.

911
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:22,450
Tell me!

912
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:36,000
I have to admit,

913
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:36,000
when your mother

914
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:36,000
came in this morning,

915
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:38,980
I assumed it was because

916
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:38,980
her heart was on the brink

917
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:38,980
of failure.

918
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:41,480
But that's not what

919
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:41,480
the echo is showing.

920
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:45,420
Looks like her heart

921
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:45,420
is beating more effectively.

922
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,790
I mean, when you have

923
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,790
the kind of underlying

924
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,790
disease Carol does,

925
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:50,920
the heart can behave

926
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:50,920
inconsistently.

927
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:52,990
But rarely does it show

928
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:52,990
this kind of improvement.

929
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,430
Yeah, that is odd.

930
00:23:55,530 --> 00:23:57,560
So, why does my mom

931
00:23:55,530 --> 00:23:57,560
keep passing out?

932
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,530
It's a phenomenon

933
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,530
called "suck down."

934
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:01,100
The heart's

935
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:01,100
contracting so hard

936
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,500
that the ventricle wall

937
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,500
is getting sucked

938
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,500
into the LVAD, too.

939
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:08,440
The poor blood circulation

940
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:08,440
is leading to a lack

941
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:08,440
of cerebral perfusion.

942
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,480
What do we do now?

943
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:13,010
I'm gonna consult

944
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:13,010
with Dr. Latham as soon

945
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:13,010
as he gets out of surgery.

946
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:15,880
There's a chance he'll want to

947
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:15,880
sew the left ventricle shut

948
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:17,040
to help the LVAD

949
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:17,040
work effectively.

950
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:20,610
Well, I mean,

951
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:20,610
this is good news, right?

952
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,120
I hesitate

953
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,120
to call it good news

954
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:23,950
until we figure out

955
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:23,950
exactly what's going on.

956
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,130
Thank you, Dr. Young.

957
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,130
Thank you.

958
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:29,590
Wow.

959
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:34,190
That's not something

960
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:34,190
you see every day.

961
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:34,190
Yeah.

962
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,970
Must be the fish oil

963
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,970
she's taking.

964
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:42,670
Wait...

965
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:42,670
What are you doing? Will!

966
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:45,140
Why are you going

967
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:45,140
through my mom's bag?

968
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:45,140
What are you doing?

969
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:47,040
Let's see what these magic

970
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:47,040
supplements look like.

971
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:49,740
God!

972
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:49,740
So embarrassing. Will!

973
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:53,120
Nope, that's

974
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:53,120
the beta blocker.

975
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:53,120
Stop!

976
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:55,120
That's the statin,

977
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:55,120
and those two are Lasix.

978
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:58,020
Where'd they go, Natalie?

979
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:58,020
What are you talking about?

980
00:24:58,130 --> 00:24:59,860
The trial drugs

981
00:24:58,130 --> 00:24:59,860
that went missing?

982
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:02,560
The blue pills?

983
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:02,560
I know you took them.

984
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:02,560
What'd you do with them?

985
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:04,890
I can't believe you're

986
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:04,890
accusing me of this...

987
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,090
The improved function

988
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,090
in your mom's left ventricle.

989
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,870
Your sudden interest

990
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,870
in the drug's side effects

991
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,870
last week.

992
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:10,960
Come to think of it,

993
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:13,870
you never did tell me

994
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:13,870
the name of that trial patient

995
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:13,870
with the dry cough.

996
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:17,910
I wonder who it is.

997
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:17,910
Oh, please, come on.

998
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:17,910
This is ridiculous!

999
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:22,210
You are dosing your mother

1000
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:22,210
with an untested clinical

1001
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:22,210
trial drug, Natalie,

1002
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,510
without supervision

1003
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,510
or monitoring.

1004
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:27,950
We don't know how the drug

1005
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:27,950
interacts with an LVAD.

1006
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:27,950
It could kill her!

1007
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:30,990
You need to come clean.

1008
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:30,990
Right now.

1009
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:33,690
Will...

1010
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:37,730
Will, I...

1011
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:37,730
Give me that.

1012
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:40,930
No. Will, wait. Wait!

1013
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,230
You heard the cardiologist!

1014
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:46,060
Mom's heart is pumping harder!

1015
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:46,060
The drugs could be working!

1016
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:49,870
We don't know that for sure.

1017
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:49,870
Please, I was desperate.

1018
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:51,670
And everything you said

1019
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:51,670
about the drug was good.

1020
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:53,840
I didn't think

1021
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:53,840
I was putting Mom

1022
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:53,840
in any danger.

1023
00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:56,710
This is really bad, Nat.

1024
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:01,850
Will, please.

1025
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:01,850
Please. Please...

1026
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:09,820
Am I interrupting?

1027
00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:12,900
Not at all. I was just

1028
00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:12,900
talking to a judge,

1029
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,900
trying to get a court order,

1030
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,900
so we could treat Neil.

1031
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,600
But without definitive proof

1032
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,600
of his medical condition,

1033
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,600
he couldn't help us.

1034
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:23,840
It doesn't matter,

1035
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:23,840
because Dr. Archer

1036
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:23,840
took Neil up to surgery,

1037
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:25,780
and is removing

1038
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:25,780
his appendix right now.

1039
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,070
Wait. Did Neil agree to that?

1040
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:33,950
No. But he went

1041
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:33,950
into respiratory distress

1042
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:33,950
and needed to be intubated.

1043
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:37,550
Leaving Dean to make

1044
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:37,550
medical decisions

1045
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:37,550
on his behalf?

1046
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:38,850
Yeah.

1047
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,060
I saw how frustrated

1048
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,060
Dr. Archer was

1049
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,060
with Neil before.

1050
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,190
Definitely.

1051
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:49,960
It got me thinking.

1052
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:49,960
Could he have...

1053
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:52,830
Could he have

1054
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:52,830
overmedicated Neil

1055
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:54,570
to knock him unconscious?

1056
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,880
Oh, God.

1057
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:07,980
Will.

1058
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:13,990
Sabeena. I didn't know

1059
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:13,990
you were coming in today.

1060
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:16,800
Just passing through,

1061
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:16,800
thought I'd see

1062
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:16,800
how you were doing.

1063
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:20,090
I have a meeting

1064
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:20,090
with the head lab technician.

1065
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,970
Yeah, no.

1066
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,970
Everything's all good here.

1067
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:24,660
Just taking a break.

1068
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:26,930
Okay.

1069
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:32,880
Hey, the drug we're testing.

1070
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:36,980
Any idea how it might affect

1071
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:36,980
a patient with an LVAD?

1072
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:40,950
The drug's an inotrope,

1073
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:40,950
essentially a chemical LVAD.

1074
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,750
Why would anyone do that?

1075
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,750
Just a hypothetical.

1076
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:46,120
I can't imagine why

1077
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:47,920
it would ever be prescribed

1078
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:47,920
in that situation.

1079
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:52,630
But, listen,

1080
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:52,630
we're a few months out

1081
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:52,630
from seeking FDA approval.

1082
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:56,260
If there's a patient suffering

1083
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:56,260
any adverse reaction,

1084
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:56,260
it needs to be reported.

1085
00:27:56,370 --> 00:28:00,140
No, nothing like that. Yeah.

1086
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:07,210
The baby's

1087
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:07,210
still hypotensive.

1088
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:09,180
I don't know if she's

1089
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:09,180
gonna survive this.

1090
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,210
I'm trying to find

1091
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,210
the source of the bleed.

1092
00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:15,150
What do you

1093
00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:15,150
want me to do?

1094
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,750
Just keep giving her

1095
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,750
more blood.

1096
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:17,980
Okay.

1097
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:21,760
Come on.

1098
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:24,860
Hey, Shawn, how you doing?

1099
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:27,870
Much better. Thank you.

1100
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:27,870
Let's check your work.

1101
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,270
Line placement looks good.

1102
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,440
As does this chest tube,

1103
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:37,730
though, I don't remember

1104
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:37,730
our patient requiring one.

1105
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,280
Sir, when I made

1106
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,280
my first attempt at placing

1107
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,280
the central line,

1108
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:42,750
I noticed air coming

1109
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:42,750
out of the syringe, so, I...

1110
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:46,680
So, she ordered an X-ray

1111
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:46,680
to see if there was a pneumo

1112
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:46,680
and there was, so she...

1113
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:47,810
Yeah, I understand.

1114
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,390
Student Dr. Taylor,

1115
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,390
can I have a word

1116
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,390
with you outside?

1117
00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:53,960
We'll be right back, Shawn.

1118
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,060
Placing a chest tube

1119
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,060
is considered

1120
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,060
a surgical procedure

1121
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:01,000
that requires

1122
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:01,000
prior consent

1123
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:01,000
from the patient.

1124
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,830
We okayed it with the patient.

1125
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:05,010
"We"?

1126
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:05,010
Maggie and myself.

1127
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:09,340
Consent for the procedure

1128
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:09,340
can only be obtained

1129
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:09,340
by a licensed physician.

1130
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,110
Neither you

1131
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,110
nor Nurse Lockwood qualify.

1132
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,710
I'm sorry, I didn't realize...

1133
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:15,240
You acted recklessly.

1134
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:18,280
By not notifying

1135
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:18,280
your supervisor,

1136
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:20,720
you put me

1137
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:20,720
and the ED at risk.

1138
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:26,490
Don't worry. I'll fix this.

1139
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:30,500
Ethan?

1140
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,930
Listen. Vanessa was just

1141
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,930
following my instructions.

1142
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:35,300
Look.

1143
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:35,300
She's gonna be a doctor.

1144
00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:37,370
What happens

1145
00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:37,370
in that treatment room

1146
00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:37,370
is her decision.

1147
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:39,030
But this is my fault.

1148
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:41,770
She's a top notch student,

1149
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:41,770
she's head of her class.

1150
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,870
What are you talking about?

1151
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,870
Student Dr. Vanessa Taylor.

1152
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:47,350
I was assisting her,

1153
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:47,350
I gave her some bad advice.

1154
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:50,510
But she solved

1155
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:50,510
the problem herself.

1156
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:53,890
Mags, why are you going

1157
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:53,890
so far out of your way

1158
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:53,890
to help this student?

1159
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:56,050
Please Ethan,

1160
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:56,050
give her a second chance.

1161
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,920
She shouldn't have to

1162
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,920
pay for my mistake.

1163
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:02,220
I'll give it some

1164
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:02,220
consideration.

1165
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:02,220
Thank you.

1166
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:05,900
Why were you assisting her?

1167
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:10,100
Doris and I just

1168
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:10,100
switched places for a bit.

1169
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:16,030
I have to relieve her now.

1170
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:30,890
So, I understand that

1171
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:30,890
we have an update

1172
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:30,890
on our patient?

1173
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:36,300
Unfortunately,

1174
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:36,300
we waited so long,

1175
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:36,300
his appendix perforated.

1176
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:39,090
So, I removed it,

1177
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:39,090
washed his belly out.

1178
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,190
And he's recovering

1179
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,190
in the ICU.

1180
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:43,460
And how did that

1181
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:43,460
happen exactly?

1182
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:47,500
He stopped protecting

1183
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:47,500
his airway, so I had

1184
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:47,500
to intubate him.

1185
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:49,530
Which then gave you

1186
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:49,530
the authority

1187
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,310
to make medical decisions

1188
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,310
for him.

1189
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:55,040
Oh, hey, if I hadn't

1190
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:55,040
come upon Neil when I did,

1191
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:55,040
oh, he'd be dead.

1192
00:30:55,150 --> 00:30:56,310
Oh, yeah.

1193
00:30:55,150 --> 00:30:56,310
He'd stopped breathing.

1194
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:57,540
From appendicitis?

1195
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:57,540
Mmm-hmm.

1196
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,280
You know that'd be

1197
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,280
a first, right?

1198
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:01,910
He was septic.

1199
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:01,910
His appendix ruptured.

1200
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:04,860
And why the hell am I

1201
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:04,860
getting the third degree?

1202
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,860
You're the one who was

1203
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,860
about to almost let

1204
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,860
a crazy person kill himself!

1205
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,230
Dean, stop!

1206
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,230
No, no, no!

1207
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:12,990
Remember,

1208
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:12,990
at the end of the day,

1209
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:12,990
it's my word versus Neil's.

1210
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:15,070
The guy who thinks

1211
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:15,070
this whole thing

1212
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:15,070
is a game of Tetris!

1213
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:17,100
Enough. Dean, take a walk.

1214
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:27,200
Someone wanna tell me

1215
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:27,200
what's going on?

1216
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:34,980
Mr. and Mrs. Fuentes.

1217
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:36,420
Is my Ada okay?

1218
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,920
She's currently

1219
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,920
on a breathing machine

1220
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,920
up in the PICU.

1221
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:40,580
Now, we're not

1222
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:40,580
out of the woods yet,

1223
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:43,020
but I was able

1224
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:43,020
to stop the bleeding.

1225
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:45,960
She's alive. Yeah.

1226
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:48,190
Thank you, Dr. Marcel.

1227
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:49,530
Yeah, my pleasure.

1228
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:52,600
I don't know what I would've

1229
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:52,600
done if we'd lost her.

1230
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:54,170
She's gonna be all right.

1231
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:00,040
Hopefully, we'll get her

1232
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:00,040
extubated tomorrow.

1233
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:02,150
In the meantime,

1234
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:02,150
Nurse Trini here,

1235
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:06,310
she's gonna escort you

1236
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:06,310
up to the PICU here in a bit.

1237
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:06,310
You can see her. Okay?

1238
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:09,050
Thank you.

1239
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:09,050
Yeah. My pleasure.

1240
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:12,990
Thanks.

1241
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:15,960
Hey.

1242
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:19,590
You been in surgery?

1243
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:19,590
Yeah. Seven-month-old

1244
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:19,590
baby with a GSW.

1245
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,490
She's gonna be okay, though.

1246
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,490
Are you?

1247
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:30,030
Yeah. Yeah,

1248
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:30,030
I'm gonna be fine. Thanks.

1249
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:34,070
Um, listen, I wanted to talk

1250
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:34,070
to you about something.

1251
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:36,410
But I was a little nervous

1252
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:36,410
about how you might take it.

1253
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:39,450
Which I know is out

1254
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:39,450
of my control, so...

1255
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:39,450
Natalie, you got a minute?

1256
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:42,460
It's about your mom.

1257
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:42,460
Oh. Yeah.

1258
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:44,680
Go ahead.

1259
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:44,680
Sorry.

1260
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:49,690
I feel incredible.

1261
00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:52,330
Your hands are warm.

1262
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:54,400
And your color's

1263
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:54,400
starting to come back.

1264
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:55,630
Oh.

1265
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:00,170
I want a pastry.

1266
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:00,170
I am famished.

1267
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:02,330
Okay, I will get you one.

1268
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,600
Go take a seat.

1269
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,600
Yeah, I will get it myself.

1270
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:07,480
Let me feel like

1271
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:07,480
a normal human being again.

1272
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:10,280
Okay. We'll be

1273
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:10,280
right over there.

1274
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:10,280
Okay.

1275
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:16,560
This is amazing.

1276
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:16,560
What changed?

1277
00:33:17,290 --> 00:33:19,560
I tried a little experiment

1278
00:33:17,290 --> 00:33:19,560
before the surgeons

1279
00:33:17,290 --> 00:33:19,560
weighed in.

1280
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:23,160
I turned her LVAD as low

1281
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:23,160
as it could go to see

1282
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:23,160
what would happen.

1283
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:24,490
And?

1284
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:27,590
Her heart's functioning fine

1285
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:27,590
with barely any assist.

1286
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,690
In fact, now, the LVAD's

1287
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,690
just getting in the way.

1288
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,270
Does that mean that...

1289
00:33:32,370 --> 00:33:34,710
It appears as if

1290
00:33:32,370 --> 00:33:34,710
the drug is working.

1291
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:36,500
We should

1292
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:36,500
keep her overnight,

1293
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:39,480
monitor her,

1294
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:39,480
but looks good.

1295
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:43,280
I wish I could

1296
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:43,280
go back in time,

1297
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:48,210
just insist that

1298
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:48,210
my mom sign up

1299
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:48,210
for the trial meds.

1300
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:52,020
We can't ask Kender

1301
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:52,020
for a compassionate

1302
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:52,020
use exemption.

1303
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:55,420
And who knows

1304
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:55,420
what they'll do

1305
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:55,420
when they find out?

1306
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:00,200
Maybe they don't need

1307
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:00,200
to find out.

1308
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:06,100
Here.

1309
00:34:13,410 --> 00:34:15,140
How many pills

1310
00:34:13,410 --> 00:34:15,140
do you have left?

1311
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,380
Maybe a week's worth.

1312
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:20,550
I'll try to secure more

1313
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:20,550
before she runs out.

1314
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:22,780
Will, I do not want to

1315
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:22,780
put you in this position.

1316
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:24,250
You let me worry about that.

1317
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,520
In the meantime, I think

1318
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,520
we should talk to Dr. Young

1319
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:28,390
about removing

1320
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:28,390
her LVAD altogether.

1321
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,620
We wanna try our chances

1322
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,620
on the transplant list.

1323
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:32,290
Are you sure?

1324
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:36,360
Yes. Natalie, if we can keep

1325
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:36,360
from getting caught,

1326
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:40,110
your mom may not ever

1327
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:40,110
need a transplant.

1328
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:47,310
I don't even know

1329
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:47,310
what to say.

1330
00:34:47,410 --> 00:34:49,180
No one else

1331
00:34:47,410 --> 00:34:49,180
can find out about this.

1332
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,410
You understand?

1333
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:52,380
Yeah.

1334
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,060
Neil, how you doing?

1335
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:07,190
Neil, this is my

1336
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:07,190
colleague, Dr. Choi.

1337
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:11,600
Hey, Neil. I'd like to discuss

1338
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:11,600
what happened today.

1339
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:17,440
It was working, the red pill.

1340
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:20,240
I was finally gonna be able

1341
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:20,240
to experience reality.

1342
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:22,840
A world that's not constantly

1343
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:22,840
trying to manipulate me.

1344
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:27,780
And then

1345
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:27,780
you so-called doctors,

1346
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:27,780
you took that away.

1347
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:31,590
Can you tell us

1348
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:31,590
more about that?

1349
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:34,080
Like you don't already know.

1350
00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:37,630
Well, we're actually

1351
00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:37,630
trying to get

1352
00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:37,630
a better picture

1353
00:35:37,730 --> 00:35:39,460
of what happened

1354
00:35:37,730 --> 00:35:39,460
this afternoon,

1355
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:42,230
when Dr. Archer

1356
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:42,230
checked in on you.

1357
00:35:42,370 --> 00:35:44,300
Can you walk us

1358
00:35:42,370 --> 00:35:44,300
through that?

1359
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,770
What you remember,

1360
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,770
anyway?

1361
00:35:47,570 --> 00:35:50,700
He cut me open

1362
00:35:47,570 --> 00:35:50,700
and rewired my circuitry,

1363
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:53,680
so that I'll never be able

1364
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:53,680
to unplug from the simulation.

1365
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:58,680
Even if I could get

1366
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:58,680
another red pill,

1367
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:58,680
it doesn't matter. Okay?

1368
00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:01,620
I'm stuck here forever!

1369
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,720
Buddy, we're gonna

1370
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,720
get you out of here

1371
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,720
as soon as possible,

1372
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:08,120
okay?

1373
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:19,670
Not necessarily the most

1374
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:19,670
reliable witness. Poor guy.

1375
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:24,340
No. But at least

1376
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:24,340
he's alive.

1377
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:24,340
Yeah.

1378
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,170
In any case, I'm gonna

1379
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,170
go have a talk with Dean.

1380
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,890
Oh, my goodness.

1381
00:36:35,290 --> 00:36:37,150
Be right back, Mom.

1382
00:36:35,290 --> 00:36:37,150
Hey, Carol.

1383
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,450
Hi!

1384
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:42,580
Hey.

1385
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:47,500
So, I saw on the surgery

1386
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:47,500
schedule that they're removing

1387
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:47,500
Carol's LVAD?

1388
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:50,260
It was actually causing

1389
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:50,260
her problems.

1390
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,460
But they lowered it

1391
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,460
and she got better.

1392
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:56,730
Wow. With her level

1393
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:56,730
of heart disease...

1394
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:56,730
never seen that.

1395
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,900
Is this what you

1396
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,900
wanted to tell me?

1397
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:02,520
Yeah, I just... I was afraid

1398
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:02,520
of how you'd take it.

1399
00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:06,210
I didn't want you to feel

1400
00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:06,210
responsible, or anything.

1401
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,720
No, I get it.

1402
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,720
All right, good.

1403
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:10,380
I should get back in there.

1404
00:37:10,490 --> 00:37:11,960
Um, but I'll see you

1405
00:37:10,490 --> 00:37:11,960
tomorrow, okay?

1406
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:13,350
Sure.

1407
00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:20,960
Vanessa!

1408
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:23,700
Hey. Good news.

1409
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:23,700
I spoke to Dr. Choi.

1410
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,670
He realizes now

1411
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,670
that what happened

1412
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,670
was entirely my fault.

1413
00:37:26,810 --> 00:37:29,300
In fact, he told me

1414
00:37:26,810 --> 00:37:29,300
that he admired

1415
00:37:26,810 --> 00:37:29,300
your handiwork.

1416
00:37:29,810 --> 00:37:32,640
Said that your chest tube

1417
00:37:29,810 --> 00:37:32,640
was placed spot on.

1418
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,340
So, trust me,

1419
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,340
if nothing else,

1420
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:35,970
he's gonna remember

1421
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:35,970
who you are now.

1422
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:41,790
Hey, you should

1423
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:41,790
feel good about today...

1424
00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:44,790
Look, I'd really appreciate it

1425
00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:44,790
if you didn't tell me

1426
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:47,220
how I should feel

1427
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:47,220
about being humiliated.

1428
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:50,690
I'm sorry, that wasn't

1429
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:50,690
my intention.

1430
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:53,730
I was just trying

1431
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:53,730
to help.

1432
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,570
You know what, while I'm here

1433
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,570
these next few weeks,

1434
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:01,270
I'd just prefer

1435
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:01,270
if you left me alone.

1436
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:06,840
Vanessa, I...

1437
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:06,840
Maggie?

1438
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:10,540
Everything okay?

1439
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:16,020
Yes. I was just talking

1440
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:16,020
to Student Dr. Vanessa Taylor

1441
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:16,020
and...

1442
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:20,730
You know, I should've known

1443
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:20,730
when I saw her this morning.

1444
00:38:20,830 --> 00:38:22,260
She's your daughter.

1445
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,030
She doesn't know,

1446
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,030
does she?

1447
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:31,870
No. And I don't

1448
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:31,870
intend to tell her, so...

1449
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:35,670
Oh, Maggie, what happens

1450
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:35,670
if these three weeks

1451
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:38,570
turn into something

1452
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:38,570
more permanent?

1453
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:40,580
What if she's accepted?

1454
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:42,870
I'll manage it.

1455
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:46,040
I'm telling you,

1456
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:46,040
this is not gonna

1457
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:46,040
be a problem.

1458
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:48,380
Looks to me

1459
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:48,380
like it already is.

1460
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:03,730
I'm sorry. My character was

1461
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:03,730
being called into question,

1462
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:08,330
and I overreacted

1463
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:08,330
and I let my emotions

1464
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:08,330
get the best of me.

1465
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:10,710
Did you snow him to

1466
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:10,710
force him into surgery?

1467
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:12,740
Why would I do that?

1468
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,680
No, really. Why would I risk

1469
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,680
my job and my career for that?

1470
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:18,650
Why would I do that?

1471
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:18,650
I don't know, Dean.

1472
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:21,650
But given the circumstances

1473
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:21,650
that happened today, I...

1474
00:39:23,490 --> 00:39:24,650
It certainly seems plausible.

1475
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,320
What do you want me to say?

1476
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:28,790
You want me to tell you

1477
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:28,790
that I can't sleep nights,

1478
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:31,390
and I'm always looking

1479
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:31,390
over my shoulder,

1480
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,590
and that's the way

1481
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,590
it's been for years? Is that

1482
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,590
what you want to hear?

1483
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:35,530
Of course not.

1484
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:35,530
I want you to be okay.

1485
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:39,970
The idea of looking

1486
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:39,970
at what happened over there,

1487
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:41,570
putting that

1488
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:41,570
under a microscope?

1489
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:45,510
No way, I'm not doing that.

1490
00:39:45,610 --> 00:39:46,980
That scares

1491
00:39:45,610 --> 00:39:46,980
the hell out of me.

1492
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:50,610
That's why I keep pushing you

1493
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:50,610
to talk to a psychiatric

1494
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:50,610
professional.

1495
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,650
If not Dr. Charles,

1496
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,650
then someone else.

1497
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:54,850
Yeah, I will. I will.

1498
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:54,850
I'm serious, man.

1499
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:57,690
I promise you.

1500
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:57,690
I will. I promise.

1501
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:01,760
Dean, if you want to

1502
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:01,760
keep working here,

1503
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:05,500
you have to deal

1504
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:05,500
with your issues.
