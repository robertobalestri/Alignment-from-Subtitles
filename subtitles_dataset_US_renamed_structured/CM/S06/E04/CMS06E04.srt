1
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:06,160
This is Auggie.

2
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:10,560
The foster family

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:10,560
felt he would be

4
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:10,560
too much to handle.

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,500
We'll do it.

6
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,500
We'll foster him.

7
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,240
I have to make

8
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,240
some changes around here.

9
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:17,510
The ED has not been running

10
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:17,510
as effectively as it could be.

11
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:21,610
A good leader takes

12
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:21,610
responsibility for everything

13
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:21,610
that happens on his watch.

14
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:24,710
I'm testing a brand-new

15
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:24,710
heart failure drug.

16
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:26,140
With some hard work,

17
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:28,250
we could fill this trial

18
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:28,250
in a matter of weeks,

19
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:28,250
not months.

20
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:31,720
Why do you do

21
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:31,720
the one-night stands?

22
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:35,030
They all end up the same.

23
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:35,030
With you alone.

24
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:41,360
There she is...

25
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:43,670
...our fearless leader.

26
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:43,670
Returning from exile.

27
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:47,210
How you doing, Michael?

28
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:47,210
You look good. You look fit.

29
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:49,180
Mmm-hmm.

30
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:49,180
Moving back home,

31
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,140
solid meals

32
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,140
instead of take-out.

33
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:53,180
The only positive thing

34
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:53,180
about being furloughed.

35
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,720
The hospital lifted

36
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,720
restriction on non-essential

37
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,720
personnel onsite.

38
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,010
Mmm-hmm.

39
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:00,520
Device reps are being

40
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:00,520
allowed into the OR.

41
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:01,610
Gotta go, Ma. Catch you later.

42
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:02,750
All righty.

43
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:02,750
Doc C.

44
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:04,450
I'll see ya.

45
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:06,690
Oh, Sharon.

46
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,200
It is so great to see you.

47
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,200
To see you.

48
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:10,320
Yeah.

49
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:10,320
In the flesh.

50
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:12,260
Thanks, Daniel.

51
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:12,260
And it's about time.

52
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:14,700
COVID protocols have been

53
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:14,700
working for months.

54
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,070
Even with my diabetes,

55
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:18,140
there was no reason

56
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:18,140
for me to stay at home.

57
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,500
Watch out, Med, she's back!

58
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,180
You care to join me

59
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,180
for a nasal swab?

60
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,150
Would love to.

61
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,150
After you.

62
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,190
Ooh. Sorry. Good morning.

63
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,190
Oh. Hi.

64
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,120
Good morning.

65
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,120
Sorry. Didn't see you

66
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,120
coming out.

67
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:41,290
I didn't see you going in.

68
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:43,490
No harm, no foul.

69
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:43,490
Mmm-hmm.

70
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:46,500
See you around.

71
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:46,500
Yeah, catch ya later.

72
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,070
See ya.

73
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,070
Okay.

74
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,760
I'm not gonna say anything.

75
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,760
But I saw that!

76
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:55,270
You saw what?

77
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:55,270
We just caught each other

78
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:55,270
by surprise.

79
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,280
Right. And did you want me

80
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,280
to pass him a note

81
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,280
in homeroom, too?

82
00:01:58,380 --> 00:01:59,400
Ha-ha.

83
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:01,310
Maggie?

84
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:01,310
One second.

85
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:03,320
We're friends. That's it.

86
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:04,720
Mmm-hmm?

87
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:10,080
Mmm... Hypothetically

88
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:10,080
though, if there were to be

89
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:10,080
that kind of attraction,

90
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:11,220
what do you think?

91
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:13,320
I don't know, Nat...

92
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:13,320
Crockett?

93
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:15,530
Is he really your type?

94
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:17,690
Oh.

95
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:27,370
Sorry... Just gotta

96
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:27,370
deal with this before

97
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:27,370
it gets out of hand.

98
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,270
Done.

99
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:31,470
Last time I pick up

100
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:31,470
the phone. Promise.

101
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,410
Trust me. I know how

102
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,410
busy you are.

103
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,850
I just really appreciate you

104
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:36,140
making the time to check in.

105
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,650
Only way to cross it off

106
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,650
the list is to get it done.

107
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:43,650
Like dealing with expense

108
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:43,650
reports, managing doctor

109
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:43,650
and nurse staffing levels,

110
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,790
let alone a distribution plan

111
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,790
for a possible COVID vaccine.

112
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,130
Wow. A lotta stuff.

113
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:51,430
Yeah. But I can handle it.

114
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:55,390
I guess my years

115
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:55,390
on active duty,

116
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,870
the COs I learned under,

117
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:58,900
Chief of the ED

118
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:58,900
is what I've been trained for.

119
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:03,810
You know, this is

120
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:03,810
an opportunity for

121
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:03,810
everyone to step up.

122
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:05,680
We need to do the job

123
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:05,680
better than ever.

124
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:09,510
Buddy, I think it's such

125
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:09,510
an admirable attitude,

126
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:09,510
you know?

127
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:12,650
It just might be

128
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:12,650
a good idea to keep in

129
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:12,650
the back of your mind,

130
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:17,160
not everybody is

131
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:17,160
as, um, combat tested,

132
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:18,780
if you will, as you are.

133
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:21,360
People are just exhausted.

134
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:21,360
For most of them,

135
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,900
doing "better,"

136
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,900
I mean, it's like,

137
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,900
getting through the day.

138
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,330
Yeah.

139
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:27,630
Listen.

140
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:30,500
My first tour,

141
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:30,500
I really struggled.

142
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,670
Far from home, no sleep,

143
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,540
Marines dying every day.

144
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,210
I went to my CO,

145
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,210
told him I was exhausted.

146
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:39,870
You know what he said?

147
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:43,280
"Now's not the time, Choi.

148
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:43,280
You can rest when it's over."

149
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,510
I get it.

150
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,510
Look, Dr. Charles,

151
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,720
I know I'm not gonna

152
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,720
be able to please everyone.

153
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:49,920
But that's not the mission.

154
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:53,500
I was promoted

155
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:53,500
to right the ship.

156
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:59,200
You wanna get that?

157
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:04,900
I gotta cut this short.

158
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,370
Do your thing, man.

159
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,370
Appreciate you stopping by.

160
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:08,530
Sure thing.

161
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,380
Dr. Driskell,

162
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,380
what do you got?

163
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,790
Drew Corbett.

164
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,790
62-year-old male,

165
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,560
eight days post presenting

166
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,560
with COVID symptoms.

167
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,960
In and out

168
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,960
of respiratory failure

169
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,960
the past three days.

170
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,490
Okay.

171
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,600
Drew married his

172
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,600
high school sweetheart.

173
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:39,400
His wife, his two kids,

174
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:39,400
his three grandkids

175
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:40,570
FaceTime him every day.

176
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:42,280
Labs?

177
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:43,900
Suggestive of

178
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:43,900
a cytokine storm.

179
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:46,980
We're trying to get it

180
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:46,980
under control, but his

181
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:46,980
vitals are still unstable.

182
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,340
What do you wanna do?

183
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,340
Keep him on a high flow O2,

184
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:50,510
start him on a COVID cocktail.

185
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,810
Good.

186
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,810
V-tach.

187
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:56,980
No pulse.

188
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:58,520
Open his airway, bag him.

189
00:04:58,660 --> 00:04:59,750
I'm on compressions.

190
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:02,490
No. Hold compressions.

191
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:05,030
Charge to 200,

192
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:05,030
draw up an amp of epi.

193
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:07,770
But he's unstable. Needs to

194
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:07,770
maintain cardiac perfusion.

195
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:09,860
No compressions.

196
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:09,860
Hospital policy.

197
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:12,630
CPR aerosolizes the virus.

198
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:12,630
Puts you all at risk.

199
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:12,630
You know that.

200
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:15,340
Paddles.

201
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:19,540
Clear.

202
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:26,350
Amp of epi,

203
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:26,350
recharge the paddles.

204
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,550
Shock him again.

205
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,950
Shock him again.

206
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,380
Clear.

207
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,060
Please, let me

208
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,060
do compressions.

209
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:41,870
It'll keep his

210
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:41,870
heart alive.

211
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:41,870
No. Run it again.

212
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,670
Clear.

213
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:00,650
We did everything we could.

214
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:25,110
Miss Goodwin, welcome back.

215
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:26,470
Thank you.

216
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,020
I haven't had a chance yet to

217
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,020
compile the nightly numbers,

218
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,580
but I'll get them

219
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,580
to you ASAP.

220
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,380
No hurry. We could

221
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,380
go over them later.

222
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:32,480
I'm just making rounds,

223
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:33,990
saying "hello" to everyone.

224
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:38,420
Mags, who's up?

225
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:40,720
Uh... Treatment 5.

226
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:43,890
Just sent it to your iPad.

227
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:43,890
Thanks.

228
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,090
Hey, I'd like to get

229
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,090
the treatment rooms

230
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,090
turned over

231
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,100
within ten minutes of

232
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,100
a patient being discharged.

233
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,460
With UV sanitizing?

234
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,460
Yeah.

235
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:53,630
I can't get it in under 15.

236
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:53,630
Try.

237
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:57,370
And please make sure the

238
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:57,370
equipment carts are restocked

239
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:57,370
three times per shift.

240
00:06:58,010 --> 00:06:59,570
Okay.

241
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:03,610
Hey, Mr. Lowry...

242
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:03,610
Dr. Lowry.

243
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,010
Plastic surgeon.

244
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,820
Excuse me. Dr. Lowry.

245
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,820
What's going on?

246
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,790
I became lightheaded

247
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,790
during a surgery.

248
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:13,590
Minor procedure, too,

249
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:13,590
a lipoma removal.

250
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:14,690
Fatty tumor.

251
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,700
Stain on the body.

252
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,700
It had to go.

253
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,430
Anyway, I felt myself going

254
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,430
limp before I could remove it.

255
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:20,800
I didn't lose consciousness.

256
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,460
Nevertheless, my surgical

257
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,460
assistant overreacted,

258
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:24,560
called 911.

259
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:27,100
She did the right thing,

260
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:27,100
for your safety

261
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:27,100
and your patient's.

262
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,840
I am the patient.

263
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,800
I meant, who you

264
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,800
were operating on.

265
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:33,810
Yeah, that's me.

266
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,440
You were operating

267
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,440
on yourself?

268
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:39,990
Of course.

269
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:39,990
I'm not gonna settle for

270
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:39,990
anything less than perfection.

271
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,750
May I?

272
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:44,880
Mmm.

273
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,570
I'm seeing other scars here.

274
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:52,830
Are these pectoral implants?

275
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,960
Indeed. I'm very

276
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,960
proud of them.

277
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:57,600
Oh. Liposuction?

278
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:59,830
Had a six pack,

279
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:59,830
now, it's an eight pack.

280
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:02,610
Filler, too.

281
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:02,610
Can't tell, can you?

282
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,070
Everything you've

283
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,070
done here looks...

284
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,070
Perfect.

285
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:07,480
I told you, I know

286
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:07,480
what I'm doing.

287
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,570
Even so, your BP is soft.

288
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,450
Likely hypovolemia

289
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,450
from blood loss

290
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,450
during the procedure.

291
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:13,750
I'm well aware.

292
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:13,750
I am a doctor.

293
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,980
So, hang a liter of LR

294
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,980
and I'll get out of here.

295
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:18,520
Actually, I prefer

296
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:18,520
normal saline.

297
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:21,190
Also, let's type and

298
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:21,190
cross two units of blood

299
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:21,190
to replenish the loss.

300
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,620
As for the lipoma,

301
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,620
we can finish that up.

302
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:24,930
I'll call Plastics

303
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:24,930
for a consult.

304
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,870
No, thanks. You do it.

305
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:30,570
It's best a surgeon

306
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:30,570
handle this.

307
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:31,700
Disagree.

308
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:35,200
Surgeons don't take

309
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:35,200
advice very well, especially

310
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:35,200
from other surgeons.

311
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:36,800
It's okay,

312
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,840
all you have to do

313
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,840
is follow my instructions.

314
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,110
Dr. Charles, I've got

315
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,110
a patient for you.

316
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:47,250
Todd Lowry. 43.

317
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:47,250
Plastic surgeon.

318
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,580
He's been operating

319
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,580
on himself. A lot.

320
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:51,720
Doesn't think twice

321
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:51,720
about the risks.

322
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:52,890
Interesting.

323
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:56,160
Doctors...

324
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:56,160
We know best, right?

325
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:59,760
Diagnosing ourselves,

326
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:59,760
writing our own scripts,

327
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:01,630
been guilty of both myself.

328
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:04,800
Sure, we take some liberties,

329
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:04,800
but Todd is way past that.

330
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,530
These aren't just

331
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,530
Botox injections,

332
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,080
they're invasive operations.

333
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:09,200
Huh.

334
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:12,140
Let me have a chat with him.

335
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,610
Check back with you.

336
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,610
Thanks.

337
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,850
Does that hurt, Isabella?

338
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,850
Sort of.

339
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:22,620
Um, it's not pain as much

340
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:22,620
as just tightness.

341
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,080
All right, I'm not

342
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,080
feeling anything overt,

343
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:27,200
but you are really

344
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:27,200
clenching your ab muscles.

345
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,090
Why don't you try to take

346
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,090
a deep breath, and relax?

347
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,100
Relax?

348
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,100
Yeah, I wish.

349
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,530
2020 kinda took

350
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,530
that off the table.

351
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:39,770
Stomach's been a mess

352
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:39,770
for a few months now.

353
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:41,210
I should have come in sooner.

354
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:44,240
You're here now.

355
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:44,240
All right, we're just

356
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:44,240
gonna do a quick X-ray.

357
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:46,610
So, if you can stay

358
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:46,610
still for a second.

359
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,190
So, um, what do you see?

360
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:59,560
Your bowel

361
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:59,560
does look distended

362
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:01,930
and there is a moderate

363
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:01,930
amount of stool.

364
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:03,330
When was your

365
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:03,330
last movement?

366
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:04,860
A few days ago.

367
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:08,800
Actually, they've been here

368
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:08,800
or there for a while.

369
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,800
Could I just be constipated?

370
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,930
I do want to run

371
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,930
some labs and get a CT,

372
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,810
but yes, this could

373
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,810
just be stress

374
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:16,670
causing you to clench

375
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:16,670
the muscles in the back,

376
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:17,940
the way you're

377
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:17,940
clenching your abs.

378
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,340
Not the "tight ass"

379
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,340
I would have wished for...

380
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:25,980
But then again, it's still

381
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:25,980
a Zoom-world, so, no one's

382
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:25,980
really looking, anyways.

383
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:27,210
There you go.

384
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,980
All right, a nurse will be by

385
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,980
in a minute, okay?

386
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:30,720
Thank you.

387
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:30,720
Yeah.

388
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:37,620
Ah. So, Doris, I need...

389
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:37,620
No.

390
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:40,100
Mmm. That's your sweet voice.

391
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:40,100
I know what that means.

392
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:44,970
What's he want now?

393
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:44,970
I put together a list.

394
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:46,970
I was never a fan

395
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:46,970
of Dr. Lanik.

396
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,170
But Ethan...

397
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:50,700
Whatever that means.

398
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:53,850
That he sucks.

399
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:53,850
I've been learning Italian.

400
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:53,850
Oh.

401
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,110
I noticed.

402
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,110
You're planning a trip?

403
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:58,620
I took an Ancestry DNA test

404
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:58,620
a few weeks ago.

405
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,280
I knew my grandparents

406
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,280
were from Chile.

407
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:02,760
I had no idea, though,

408
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:02,760
that their grandparents

409
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,290
were from Naples.

410
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:05,620
Oh, that's cool.

411
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:07,750
I've never been to Italy.

412
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:07,750
It's on the list, though.

413
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:11,090
Until then? You, Trini and

414
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:11,090
Hank, take the first three.

415
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:11,090
I'll take the rest.

416
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:18,870
So, no running

417
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:18,870
on the treadmill?

418
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:22,140
Nope. Only blood work

419
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:22,140
and an echo, Mr. Gessner.

420
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,400
But what

421
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,400
about the meds?

422
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:26,340
Hospitals push an aspirin

423
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:26,340
for 30 bucks a pop.

424
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:28,750
Heart disease pill

425
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:28,750
you're selling,

426
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:30,680
bet I'd probably

427
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:30,680
need a second mortgage

428
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:30,680
to pay for that.

429
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:31,950
If you qualify,

430
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:33,040
the pharmaceutical company

431
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,180
covers all costs.

432
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:36,720
I like that.

433
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,720
So, uh, what do you say?

434
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:41,290
Can I enroll you?

435
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,160
No, sorry. Too risky. I...

436
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:45,930
What? How? Mr. Gessner...

437
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:49,800
You know, my ticker's

438
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:49,800
not great, but the pills

439
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:49,800
I'm on, are working.

440
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:54,240
COVID, though, that bug

441
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:54,240
is a wildcard. I...

442
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:56,340
No. No hospitals till

443
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:56,340
I've gotten the vaccine.

444
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,670
Please don't hang up.

445
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:59,450
The COVID ward

446
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:59,450
is completely contained.

447
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,840
No contact with where

448
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,840
you will be in the ED.

449
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:04,080
Yeah. Says you.

450
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:04,080
It's the truth.

451
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,290
I'm there all day.

452
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,290
I've never felt safer.

453
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:11,190
Okay, I guess I can

454
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:11,190
come in this afternoon.

455
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:13,830
Mr. Gessner, thank you.

456
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:13,830
I'll see you later.

457
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,390
Nice job.

458
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,890
He almost got away.

459
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:24,300
God, too many of them have.

460
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:24,300
That's why I'm behind

461
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:24,300
on my quota.

462
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:27,810
Millions suffer from

463
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:27,810
heart failure, April.

464
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:30,880
I had no idea how difficult

465
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:30,880
it'd be finding them.

466
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:33,210
I don't get it. We get cases

467
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:33,210
in the ED every day,

468
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:34,480
not to mention Cardiology.

469
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,350
And they've thrown me

470
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,350
a bunch of files.

471
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:39,050
Unfortunately, the study's

472
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:39,050
exclusionary criteria

473
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:40,820
weed out a lot of patients.

474
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:45,760
I am meeting a cardiologist

475
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:45,760
at Chicago Congress

476
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:45,760
later this morning,

477
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:47,890
hoping he'll throw me

478
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:47,890
a few patients.

479
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:51,800
And I'll keep pitching

480
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:51,800
the Med patients

481
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:51,800
that are left.

482
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,400
I'd like to help.

483
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:56,200
Yeah?

484
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,330
When I was

485
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,330
on the COVID ward,

486
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,070
I felt like I was

487
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,070
a part of something

488
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:02,140
so much bigger

489
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:02,140
than myself.

490
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:05,910
I'd like to feel that again.

491
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:05,910
I'll make time.

492
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:08,110
Welcome aboard.

493
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,850
All right.

494
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:13,050
So, why don't you focus

495
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:13,050
on your meeting,

496
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:16,950
and I will reach out

497
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:16,950
to the rest of these

498
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:16,950
Med patients.

499
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:20,350
All right.

500
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:20,350
Great.

501
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,260
All right.

502
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:35,330
Dr. Manning,

503
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:39,110
all this, it's...

504
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:39,110
Tumor.

505
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:42,110
Her abdomen

506
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:42,110
is full of cancer.

507
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:58,430
Cancer... um,

508
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:58,430
I don't understand.

509
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:58,430
I'm only 21.

510
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:03,240
I should've come in the moment

511
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:03,240
that I felt something was off,

512
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:07,210
but, um, I live at home,

513
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:07,210
both my parents

514
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:07,210
are high risk for COVID.

515
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:09,440
I just didn't want to

516
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:09,440
bring it into the house.

517
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:13,000
We understand.

518
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:13,000
You thought you were doing

519
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:13,000
what was right.

520
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:17,280
Am I gonna die?

521
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:21,220
No, hey. Look,

522
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:21,220
we'll confer with Oncology,

523
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,350
but I believe that, um,

524
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,350
this section

525
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:27,020
and this section, too,

526
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:27,020
are amenable to resection.

527
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:30,360
Resection, um...

528
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:30,360
That means surgery, right?

529
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:31,590
That's right.

530
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,390
The more tumor I remove now,

531
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,270
the better you're positioned

532
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,270
for cancer treatment later.

533
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:39,100
Okay.

534
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:45,980
Hey. I know you're scared.

535
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:45,980
But you can win this fight.

536
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:54,050
Wow. That's impressive.

537
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:58,020
Not just the attention

538
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:58,020
to detail, but the focus

539
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:58,020
that must be

540
00:14:58,130 --> 00:14:59,360
required to achieve that.

541
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:03,060
Flattery, really?

542
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,930
You're the head

543
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,930
of Psychiatry.

544
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:06,470
I figured you'd use something

545
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:06,470
a little more clever

546
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:07,930
to get inside my head.

547
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,560
Oh, come on. We're just, uh,

548
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,560
having a little chat.

549
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,230
Okay. Fine, I'll bite.

550
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:14,470
But scrap the pats

551
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:14,470
on the back.

552
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:14,470
I know I'm good,

553
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,010
you don't need to tell me.

554
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,940
You mind if I sit?

555
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:25,540
This is invasive.

556
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:30,460
The tumor already has

557
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:30,460
a blood supply, has invaded

558
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:30,460
the surrounding tissues.

559
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:33,990
Yes, but there's two

560
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:33,990
clear areas of focus around

561
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:33,990
the left lobe of the liver.

562
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,170
And the same

563
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,170
with the inferior poles

564
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,170
of the kidneys here.

565
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,160
I don't think so.

566
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:43,030
My experience,

567
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:43,030
CTs are rarely as accurate

568
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:43,030
as they appear.

569
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,110
Tumor already looks

570
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,110
like a nightmare,

571
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:48,900
what's actually going on

572
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:48,900
inside is a disaster.

573
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:51,140
Okay, look, all due respect,

574
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:51,140
Dr. Gillin,

575
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:54,040
I'm not pushing to operate

576
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:54,040
to boost my resume.

577
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,910
I want to save

578
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,910
Isabella's life.

579
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:57,280
So do I.

580
00:15:57,550 --> 00:16:00,610
This CT, though...

581
00:15:57,550 --> 00:16:00,610
Worst case territory.

582
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:02,280
A biopsy

583
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:05,360
and appropriate chemo regimen

584
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:05,360
are the safest first step.

585
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:08,560
Perhaps, surgery

586
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:08,560
down the line.

587
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:08,560
"Perhaps"?

588
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,590
She's very sick, Dr. Manning.

589
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:13,530
If we'd been able

590
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:13,530
to treat her earlier...

591
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:13,530
We weren't.

592
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:15,190
I understand.

593
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:18,940
And in that time, her

594
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:18,940
cancer progressed too far.

595
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:27,480
So, that's it?

596
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,050
Dr. Gillin has her opinion.

597
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,050
I have mine.

598
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:39,180
So, how'd it go?

599
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:41,160
Did Dr. Lowry,

600
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:41,160
plastic surgeon,

601
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:41,160
shrink himself?

602
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:43,160
Not really his priority.

603
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:45,060
Putting him

604
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:45,060
on a five-day, then?

605
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:47,190
A psych hold? Why?

606
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,590
Dr. Charles,

607
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,590
he cut himself open.

608
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,610
Yeah. Because of

609
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,610
body dysmorphia,

610
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:53,240
which is driven, ironically,

611
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:56,240
by a desire

612
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:56,240
to perfect his body.

613
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:56,240
Not to hurt himself.

614
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:57,540
Maybe not intentionally.

615
00:16:57,650 --> 00:17:00,140
But that perfectionism

616
00:16:57,650 --> 00:17:00,140
clearly clouds his judgment.

617
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:01,340
We need to step in.

618
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:05,610
Thing is, BDD isn't

619
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:05,610
something that we can

620
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:05,610
just fix. You know?

621
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:09,120
Todd's gotta develop

622
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:09,120
an entirely new perspective

623
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:09,120
on his body.

624
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:10,590
It's gonna take time,

625
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:10,590
you know?

626
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:13,590
You know a guy like Todd

627
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:13,590
isn't gonna go

628
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:13,590
into therapy voluntarily.

629
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:15,420
We intervene now,

630
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:15,420
or this just gets worse.

631
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:19,060
I hear ya.

632
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:19,060
And we'll take that

633
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:19,060
under advisement.

634
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,170
Hey, Mags, where are we

635
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,170
on those changes

636
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,170
to the nursing routine?

637
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:26,240
Ethan,

638
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:26,240
we're short-staffed.

639
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:28,430
I'm doing what I can.

640
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:28,430
The other nurses, too.

641
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:32,600
It's Ben.

642
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:32,600
Give me two minutes?

643
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:35,270
Yeah. Just get

644
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:35,270
the changes done, okay?

645
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:36,370
Yeah.

646
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:39,550
Hey, babe, what's up?

647
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:41,450
Auggie's not feeling so hot.

648
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:45,430
Temp's a little high.

649
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:45,430
He hasn't thrown up,

650
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:45,430
but feels like he might.

651
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:47,190
How's his energy?

652
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:47,190
Low.

653
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:49,330
Doesn't even have

654
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:49,330
enough strength

655
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:49,330
for Minecraft.

656
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:51,660
That's a red flag.

657
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:51,660
Can you put him on?

658
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,730
Sure.

659
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,040
Hey, little man.

660
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,100
Sorry for bothering you

661
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,100
at work.

662
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:01,770
There's nothing

663
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:01,770
to apologize for.

664
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:06,610
Can you do me a favor,

665
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:06,610
can you lean in real close

666
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:06,610
to the phone?

667
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:09,120
And look into the lens,

668
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:09,120
so, I can see your eyes.

669
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:13,550
Okay. Thanks, honey.

670
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:17,320
You can go back to resting.

671
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:21,830
So, what do you think?

672
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:24,300
Natalie needs

673
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:24,300
to take a look.

674
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,070
Okay.

675
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:29,570
I'll bring him in.

676
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:29,570
Yeah.

677
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,710
Are we there?

678
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:34,500
I hope not.

679
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,310
You've been

680
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,310
seeing results?

681
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:41,640
So far, yes.

682
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:44,580
Study's still small,

683
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:44,580
but the data has been

684
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:44,580
very encouraging.

685
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:47,720
It always is

686
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:47,720
in the early phases.

687
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:51,450
But I've seen a lot

688
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:51,450
of heart failure trials

689
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:51,450
come and go.

690
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:54,320
Is this the real deal?

691
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:54,320
I hope so.

692
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:58,330
Yesterday, I treated a woman

693
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:58,330
in the ED, massive MI.

694
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:00,590
She's now on a vent

695
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:00,590
in the CCU and the odds

696
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:00,590
are not on her side.

697
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:06,510
But if this

698
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:06,510
oral inotrope works,

699
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:09,710
what happened to her

700
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:09,710
may not have to happen

701
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:09,710
to anyone else.

702
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:14,210
Okay, sold. I'm in.

703
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:16,210
Wonderful.

704
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:19,150
Thank you, Dr. Mayfield.

705
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:19,150
Your patients will really

706
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:19,150
help the study.

707
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:23,620
That's great

708
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:23,620
for your hospital.

709
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:23,620
Now, let's discuss mine.

710
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:26,390
How's 30% sound?

711
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:29,560
Sorry, uh, 30% of what?

712
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:32,360
Your patient enrollment fee.

713
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,400
A kickback?

714
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:38,840
That's a harsh word.

715
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:41,530
I prefer we call it

716
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:41,530
"quid pro quo."

717
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,310
Call it whatever you want,

718
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,310
it's unethical.

719
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,780
I can't do it.

720
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:48,240
I'm afraid

721
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:48,240
I can't help you.

722
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,510
Look, I'm from Canaryville,

723
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,510
I get that one hand

724
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,510
washes the other,

725
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:53,610
but that's

726
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:53,610
neighborhood politics,

727
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:53,610
this is science.

728
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,920
Yeah. This isn't

729
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,920
Chicago Med, Dr. Halstead.

730
00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:00,350
There's no university backing,

731
00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:00,350
or Wall Street investment

732
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:01,930
or billionaire benefactors.

733
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:05,220
I cannot afford

734
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:05,220
to give away patients

735
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:05,220
for free. I'm sorry.

736
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:08,430
Good luck with your trial.

737
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,330
Appreciate your time,

738
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,330
Dr. Mayfield.

739
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:22,870
Miss Goodwin, I've discussed

740
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:22,870
all the risks with Isabella.

741
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,710
She wants to proceed

742
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,710
with surgery.

743
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,580
And I'm confident

744
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,580
I can do it.

745
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:29,450
This isn't about

746
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:29,450
your ability, Dr. Marcel.

747
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:32,290
It's about the state

748
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:32,290
of Isabella's cancer.

749
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:36,590
Dr. Gillin is the head

750
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:36,590
of Oncology. I will not

751
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:36,590
override her decision.

752
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:40,500
Miss Goodwin,

753
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:40,500
without being able

754
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:40,500
to resect part of the tumor,

755
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,730
the chemo won't work.

756
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:44,530
Please,

757
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:44,530
we are where we are

758
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,370
because she was

759
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,370
protecting her family.

760
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,910
She deserves our help.

761
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:53,610
This virus, not only

762
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:53,610
is it still killing people,

763
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:56,580
but it's forced

764
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:56,580
thousands of others,

765
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:56,580
like Isabella,

766
00:20:56,850 --> 00:20:59,480
to delay or even

767
00:20:56,850 --> 00:20:59,480
interrupt treatment.

768
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:02,710
Not just cancer,

769
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:02,710
but all chronic illnesses.

770
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:07,660
Look, I wish I could

771
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:07,660
help every patient,

772
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:13,570
but the honest reality is,

773
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:13,570
some won't be able

774
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:13,570
to be saved.

775
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:19,840
World kinda sucks

776
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:19,840
right now, Miss Goodwin.

777
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:24,640
Yes, it does.

778
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:26,610
Thank you.

779
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,590
I'll call over

780
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,590
to the Mayo Clinic...

781
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,590
Sloan Kettering.

782
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:38,020
See if they'll do

783
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:38,020
the surgery.

784
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:39,880
Yeah. Worth a try.

785
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:42,290
Uh, I'm gonna

786
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:42,290
fill in Isabella.

787
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:42,290
Oh, I'll come with you.

788
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:44,900
Oh, actually,

789
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:44,900
if you don't mind,

790
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:44,900
I'd like to do it alone.

791
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,470
I sold her on the surgery.

792
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,830
It's up to me to tell her

793
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,830
I spoke too soon.

794
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,670
Okay. Yeah.

795
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,670
Thanks.

796
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:06,780
Pull slowly and evenly.

797
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:08,950
I am.

798
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,960
No fragments?

799
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:14,620
No. All clean.

800
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:23,000
Okay, we can move on.

801
00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:31,680
Easy.

802
00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:31,680
I'm controlling

803
00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:31,680
the bleeders.

804
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:33,040
No, you're frying

805
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:33,040
healthy tissue.

806
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:34,710
All right,

807
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:34,710
I'm calling Plastics.

808
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:34,710
They'll finish up.

809
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,750
No, look, we're almost done.

810
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:38,620
I don't have the energy to

811
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:38,620
start over with someone new.

812
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:40,720
Then please

813
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:40,720
let me do my job.

814
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,060
Rather you use

815
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,060
absorbable sutures.

816
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:57,800
Can you grab 3-0 absorbable

817
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:57,800
Vicryl sutures off the cart?

818
00:22:57,910 --> 00:22:59,840
Actually,

819
00:22:57,910 --> 00:22:59,840
Monocryl instead of Vicryl.

820
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:02,470
We don't have that in the ED.

821
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:02,470
I'd have to call OR,

822
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:02,470
have them sent down.

823
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,740
I just want it done right.

824
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,830
Me, too.

825
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:07,740
But second guessing

826
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:07,740
every move I make

827
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:07,740
isn't gonna get us there.

828
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:10,450
Fine.

829
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:11,750
Vicryl will do.

830
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:16,450
Let's see.

831
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:17,850
Okay.

832
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:21,690
I'm sorry, Auggie,

833
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:21,690
I know that we're doing

834
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:21,690
a lot of poking around.

835
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,700
That's okay. I trust you.

836
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:38,570
I'm gonna go talk

837
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:38,570
to Dr. Manning

838
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:38,570
for a minute, okay?

839
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,840
All right.

840
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,840
Okay.

841
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:48,650
His liver's failing.

842
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:48,650
Yes.

843
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,780
He's stable, though.

844
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:53,090
Adjusting his meds

845
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:53,090
will ease his discomfort.

846
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:55,820
But...

847
00:23:57,730 --> 00:23:58,890
It's time to admit him,

848
00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:01,830
get him

849
00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:01,830
on the transplant list.

850
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:05,770
I knew this day would come.

851
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:09,870
I've been preparing.

852
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:09,870
I thought I'd be ready. I...

853
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:14,010
I know it feels like

854
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:14,010
you're alone right now,

855
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:14,010
but you're not.

856
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,420
I am here for you, okay?

857
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,830
Last one.

858
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:33,190
Good?

859
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:41,770
The nurse

860
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:41,770
will dress the wound.

861
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,480
That guy is impossible.

862
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,480
On me the entire procedure.

863
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:52,190
Well, he is challenging,

864
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:52,190
I'll give you that.

865
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,680
And he's a doctor.

866
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,680
If he's reckless

867
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,680
with his own health,

868
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:56,050
he could be reckless

869
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:56,050
with patients.

870
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,620
He shouldn't be practicing.

871
00:24:57,730 --> 00:25:01,560
Except that people with BDD

872
00:24:57,730 --> 00:25:01,560
tend to be pretty rational.

873
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:03,600
Except when it comes

874
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:03,600
to their own bodies.

875
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,100
And that tracks

876
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,100
with Dr. Lowry.

877
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,630
Talking with him,

878
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,630
it's clear that

879
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:10,470
he just doesn't have the same

880
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:10,470
issue with his patients

881
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:10,470
as he does with himself.

882
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:13,570
Maybe the medical board should

883
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:13,570
be the one to decide that.

884
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:16,800
Well, I think

885
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:16,800
I'm pretty qualified.

886
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:18,900
I...

887
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:24,480
He's more unstable

888
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:24,480
than you think, Dr. Charles.

889
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:30,220
Ooh. Look on that face,

890
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:30,220
I'm guessing the meeting

891
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:30,220
was a bust.

892
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,220
Huge.

893
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:35,120
Doctor over there, Mayfield,

894
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:35,120
he's got a ton of patients.

895
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:37,600
But he won't share any

896
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:37,600
unless I pad his pockets.

897
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:40,030
So, I walked out.

898
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:40,030
Good.

899
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:42,830
You shouldn't partner

900
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:42,830
with someone who's just

901
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:42,830
in it for a payout.

902
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:44,670
Of course,

903
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:44,670
turning him down means

904
00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:46,900
I'm back to square one,

905
00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:46,900
short on candidates.

906
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:48,700
How'd the rest

907
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:48,700
of the Med files go?

908
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,640
I called them all.

909
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,640
There was definite interest.

910
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,940
No one committed,

911
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,940
but I told them

912
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,940
you'd follow up.

913
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:55,550
Fingers crossed.

914
00:25:55,650 --> 00:25:59,920
Hey, it was a tough morning,

915
00:25:55,650 --> 00:25:59,920
but Ed Gessner's

916
00:25:55,650 --> 00:25:59,920
coming in, right?

917
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:02,650
Still a win to be had.

918
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:02,650
Yeah, you're right,

919
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:05,690
keep looking forward.

920
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:05,690
Yeah.

921
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:09,860
Maggie, you've got

922
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:09,860
to understand,

923
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:09,860
Auggie has a rare blood type

924
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,990
and no family

925
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,990
to reach out to

926
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,990
for a direct donation.

927
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:15,540
Sharon, please don't be

928
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:15,540
an administrator right now.

929
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,940
You're my friend,

930
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,940
just level with me.

931
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,870
How long might it be

932
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,870
before Auggie gets a liver?

933
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:23,540
I'm not sure. Gift of Hope

934
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:23,540
oversees the transplant list.

935
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:26,550
The hospital has no influence

936
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:26,550
over that process.

937
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:28,240
But you know the system

938
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:28,240
inside and out.

939
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:31,650
Experience must be giving you

940
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:31,650
some kind of a gut feeling.

941
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,190
Auggie's not critical,

942
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:42,920
so, I imagine at this point,

943
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:42,920
he's low on the list.

944
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:50,130
So, we have to wait

945
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:50,130
for Auggie to get sicker

946
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:53,600
and the donor's liver

947
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:53,600
is gonna be hard to find.

948
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,850
It might not happen...

949
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:01,140
will it?

950
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:05,080
I don't know, Maggie.

951
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:08,150
I'm sorry.

952
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:19,170
No, I understand.

953
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:19,170
The spread is extensive.

954
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:24,330
Yes. Mmm-hmm. That is

955
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:24,330
the plan our oncologist

956
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:24,330
recommended as well.

957
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,300
Okay. Thank you, Dr. Webber.

958
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,610
Dr. Manning...

959
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,610
Um, just one sec...

960
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:32,180
I'm sorry,

961
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:32,180
but this can't wait.

962
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:36,640
Where?

963
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:36,640
Six.

964
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,980
Oh, my God, Crockett,

965
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,980
you've gone rogue?

966
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:46,020
Have you lost your mind?

967
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:49,250
I've overstepped, okay?

968
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:49,250
But the bigger issue is this.

969
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:54,970
Dr. Gillin was right.

970
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:54,970
Deeper I go,

971
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:54,970
the more tumor I find.

972
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:58,030
Peritoneal studding,

973
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:58,030
carcinomatosis...

974
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:00,000
there's cancer everywhere.

975
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:00,000
Yeah.

976
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:01,170
Her kidneys are overrun.

977
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:04,710
My first instinct was to

978
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:04,710
remove them, but that'd

979
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:04,710
tie Isabella to dialysis.

980
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:06,370
No way she'd be able

981
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:06,370
to tolerate the chemo then.

982
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:09,410
If you can't leave

983
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:09,410
the kidneys in and you can't

984
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:09,410
take the kidneys out,

985
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,310
then what's left?

986
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:14,650
Ex-vivo.

987
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:17,290
Remove one kidney,

988
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:17,290
debulk it of as much

989
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:17,290
cancer as possible,

990
00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:19,720
then re-implant,

991
00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:19,720
reattach and repeat

992
00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:19,720
with the other one.

993
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:22,190
Crockett, ex-vivo surgeries

994
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:22,190
are still experimental.

995
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:25,430
There is no guarantee

996
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:25,430
the kidneys will work

997
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:25,430
once you put them back in.

998
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,370
Maybe.

999
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,340
You didn't call me up here

1000
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,340
to debate this, did you?

1001
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:36,270
Natalie, if we don't

1002
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:36,270
do this, Isabella dies.

1003
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:45,450
I'll scrub in.

1004
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:53,320
Hey.

1005
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:56,120
How'd the follow-up calls go

1006
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:56,120
to the Med patients

1007
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:56,120
I reached out to?

1008
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:58,030
Two outta eight.

1009
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:58,030
That's something.

1010
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:00,820
There he is...

1011
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:04,770
Mr. Gessner!

1012
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:04,770
Hey, Mr. Gessner?

1013
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:04,770
Welcome.

1014
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,710
Here we go.

1015
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,710
Okay, clear him out of this.

1016
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:12,250
What the hell?

1017
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:12,250
Why isn't the ambo

1018
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:12,250
using the COVID entrance?

1019
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:15,010
I don't know,

1020
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:15,010
must be backed up.

1021
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:17,180
What's he doing?

1022
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,220
No, no, no.

1023
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,220
No, no, no, no...

1024
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:22,080
Hey, Mr. Gessner,

1025
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:22,080
wait, please.

1026
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:22,080
You said it was safe!

1027
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:23,350
It is! I swear.

1028
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:26,430
Hey, the ED is nowhere

1029
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:26,430
near the COVID...

1030
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:26,430
I don't care!

1031
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:31,260
Please, please, don't.

1032
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:31,260
Mr. Gessner. Hey, I just...

1033
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,030
Okay.

1034
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:41,370
You can let

1035
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:41,370
Commander Choi know

1036
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:44,340
treatment rooms are

1037
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:44,340
being turned over within

1038
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:44,340
ten minutes as ordered.

1039
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,410
Okay. Great.

1040
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:48,850
While I've got you,

1041
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:48,850
I have a cousin

1042
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:48,850
in Rockford

1043
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:51,380
who needs a hand, pregnant,

1044
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:51,380
three kids in homeschool...

1045
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:54,920
I know it's a pain,

1046
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:54,920
but can I get

1047
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:54,920
a few days off next week?

1048
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:56,420
Yeah, sure...

1049
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,940
All right. All done.

1050
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,230
You see? That only

1051
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,230
took two seconds.

1052
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,200
What's it for?

1053
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:18,500
To find you a liver.

1054
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:25,050
All right, sweetie.

1055
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:31,080
Right kidney's

1056
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:31,080
looking good.

1057
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:31,080
Great.

1058
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,960
Seems luck

1059
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,960
is on our side.

1060
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:36,020
Just gotta finish

1061
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:36,020
closing the capsule,

1062
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:38,890
then we can re-implant and

1063
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:38,890
move on to the other one.

1064
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,060
Dr. Marcel, you scheduled

1065
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,060
a central line insertion.

1066
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:44,540
We had a complication.

1067
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:44,540
Had to expand.

1068
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:46,030
Okay.

1069
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:49,230
You scheduled

1070
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:49,230
a central line insertion

1071
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:49,230
as a cover to book the OR?

1072
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:52,340
I needed the room with as

1073
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:52,340
few questions as possible.

1074
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:54,850
Figured I'd cross this bridge

1075
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:54,850
when I got to it.

1076
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:55,940
We're there.

1077
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,020
And it doesn't seem like

1078
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,020
she's gonna be looking

1079
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,020
the other way.

1080
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,880
Only a matter of time

1081
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,880
before we're found out.

1082
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:02,550
Yep.

1083
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,530
What are you doing?

1084
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,130
I don't like

1085
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,130
your wound eversion!

1086
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:15,400
No, no, no. I closed

1087
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:15,400
all the dead space.

1088
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:15,400
It will heal seamlessly.

1089
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:16,560
There'll be a dimple!

1090
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:16,560
They need to be fixed!

1091
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:18,500
Don't! Don't!

1092
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:18,500
Get off!

1093
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:19,600
Get off of me!

1094
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:21,840
Please. Please.

1095
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:21,840
You're hurting yourself.

1096
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:21,840
Need some help in here.

1097
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,170
This is all your fault.

1098
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,170
They're not perfect!

1099
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,340
Hey, Dr. Lowry...

1100
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,340
Stop, stop. Soft restraints.

1101
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:29,350
No. No restraints.

1102
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:29,350
No restraints.

1103
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:29,350
Get off of me!

1104
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:30,940
Need five of Haldol.

1105
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:30,940
Not yet.

1106
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:33,410
He needs to be sedated!

1107
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:33,410
Ethan!

1108
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:36,250
I'm gonna be the one

1109
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:36,250
who makes that call.

1110
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:36,250
Okay? Let me handle this.

1111
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:40,090
Hey. Hey, Todd. Look at me.

1112
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:40,090
Look at me. Right here.

1113
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:40,090
What's going on, buddy?

1114
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:41,530
Breathe with me,

1115
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:41,530
all right?

1116
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:44,390
In through the nose.

1117
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:47,590
Look at me.

1118
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:47,590
In through the nose,

1119
00:31:48,170 --> 00:31:49,570
out through the mouth.

1120
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:51,100
And push out.

1121
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:57,570
He's a lot calmer...

1122
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:59,500
Don't you ever interfere

1123
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:59,500
with the treatment

1124
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:59,500
of my patient again.

1125
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:01,470
Buddy, you're way

1126
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:01,470
out of line.

1127
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:01,470
Me?

1128
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:04,410
The guy's ripping himself

1129
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:04,410
to shreds. I told you

1130
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:04,410
he needed to be on a hold.

1131
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,950
You shot that down

1132
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,950
and here we are!

1133
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:08,080
That's right.

1134
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:08,080
And locking him up

1135
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:08,080
still isn't the answer.

1136
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:09,280
Neither are restraints

1137
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:09,280
or sedatives.

1138
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:11,650
How can you say that?

1139
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:11,650
He's harming himself.

1140
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:14,430
If you would have just

1141
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:14,430
helped me, we wouldn't be

1142
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:14,430
in this situation!

1143
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:48,590
How's the left kidney?

1144
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:48,590
Pinking up yet?

1145
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,460
No. Still purple.

1146
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:52,160
Orientation is good, though.

1147
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:55,670
No rotation,

1148
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:55,670
inflow artery isn't kinked.

1149
00:32:55,970 --> 00:32:58,230
Doppler it.

1150
00:32:55,970 --> 00:32:58,230
Doppler...

1151
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:04,140
Sounds monophasic.

1152
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:04,140
There's blood flow,

1153
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:04,140
just not enough.

1154
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,510
Okay. Marty, get her

1155
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,510
blood pressure up,

1156
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:09,280
five thousand units

1157
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:09,280
of heparin, let's go.

1158
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:11,250
Meds are in.

1159
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:13,480
No change.

1160
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:15,490
Look,

1161
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:15,490
we've been able

1162
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:15,490
to resect a lot of tumor.

1163
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:17,620
Two kidneys would be ideal,

1164
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,520
but one's enough for her

1165
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,520
to tolerate chemo.

1166
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:21,320
Last knot.

1167
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:22,590
Snip.

1168
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:25,090
Moment of truth.

1169
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:26,730
Unclamp the vein.

1170
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:29,660
Nice and easy. Easy, easy.

1171
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:31,470
Then the artery.

1172
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:45,150
It's pinking up.

1173
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:46,740
Strong blood flow.

1174
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:46,740
There it is.

1175
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:54,620
I am gonna have you

1176
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:54,620
both fired.

1177
00:33:57,030 --> 00:33:58,160
How is she?

1178
00:33:58,630 --> 00:34:00,100
In great shape.

1179
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,690
We're about to close.

1180
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,690
Glad to hear it.

1181
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:05,100
Nevertheless,

1182
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:09,270
she's the last patient

1183
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:09,270
either one of you will

1184
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:09,270
ever see at this hospital.

1185
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:28,090
Dr. Mayfield,

1186
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,590
thanks for seeing me again.

1187
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,590
Of course.

1188
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:32,320
Sorry to keep you waiting.

1189
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:34,760
So many patients,

1190
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:34,760
it's always something.

1191
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:39,040
Don't have to tell you

1192
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:39,040
that, though. We're all

1193
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:39,040
in this together, right?

1194
00:34:40,170 --> 00:34:43,670
To that end, I've had

1195
00:34:40,170 --> 00:34:43,670
some time to reflect on

1196
00:34:40,170 --> 00:34:43,670
our earlier conversation,

1197
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:47,240
realized

1198
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:47,240
there's always a way

1199
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:47,240
to find common ground.

1200
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,640
That is, if you're

1201
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,640
still interested?

1202
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:53,650
I am. Come on in.

1203
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:53,650
We'll talk details.

1204
00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:03,060
Yeah.

1205
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,190
Hey.

1206
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:08,530
Um...

1207
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:13,300
I just wanted to apologize

1208
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:13,300
for my behavior.

1209
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:13,300
I overreacted.

1210
00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:17,100
Apology accepted.

1211
00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:17,100
Appreciate you coming down.

1212
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:25,780
What did you, uh,

1213
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:25,780
do to your hand?

1214
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:31,090
Rough day.

1215
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:31,090
Tell me about it. Right?

1216
00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:34,250
After I, uh...

1217
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:39,390
...left your office

1218
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:39,390
this morning,

1219
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:42,400
there was a patient,

1220
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:42,400
Drew Corbett. He died.

1221
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:44,530
Acute respiratory failure.

1222
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:49,740
When Drew coded, the resident

1223
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:49,740
wanted to do compressions,

1224
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:56,550
but that's against protocol,

1225
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:56,550
so, I held them back.

1226
00:35:57,750 --> 00:35:59,310
Okay.

1227
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:07,660
I stood outside

1228
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:07,660
the treatment room

1229
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:07,660
and I watched Drew die.

1230
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:19,760
I wanted to pound

1231
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:19,760
on his chest.

1232
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,670
But I just stood there

1233
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,670
and I did nothing.

1234
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:30,710
Same as yesterday.

1235
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:30,710
Same as it'll be tomorrow.

1236
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:34,810
Man, I'm just, uh...

1237
00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:37,920
I'm just so sorry

1238
00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:37,920
you gotta go through that.

1239
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:45,460
You know,

1240
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:45,460
maybe the reason that

1241
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:47,930
you got so upset

1242
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:47,930
at Dr. Lowry

1243
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:47,930
is as simple as this.

1244
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:52,300
I mean,

1245
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:52,300
it's very easy to look

1246
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:52,300
at body dysmorphic disorder

1247
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:54,530
as physical,

1248
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:54,530
about the body, right?

1249
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:58,740
But it's actually

1250
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:58,740
a control issue. Right?

1251
00:36:58,850 --> 00:37:03,910
Not unlike feeling responsible

1252
00:36:58,850 --> 00:37:03,910
for every patient's outcome.

1253
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,750
Or wanting to keep

1254
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:12,620
an ED functioning perfectly

1255
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:12,620
in the middle of a pandemic.

1256
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:14,960
Lives are at stake,

1257
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:14,960
Dr. Charles.

1258
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:16,750
I have to be effective

1259
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:16,750
at what I do.

1260
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:19,600
But what if that's

1261
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:19,600
not always possible?

1262
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:22,360
So, what? I'm just

1263
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:22,360
supposed to give up?

1264
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:23,460
Accept failure?

1265
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:24,700
No.

1266
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:28,770
Accept being mortal.

1267
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:35,910
Remember when we were

1268
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:35,910
dealing with your PTSD?

1269
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:38,980
The, um,

1270
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:38,980
Serenity Prayer?

1271
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:41,950
How'd that go again?

1272
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:46,390
"Grant me the serenity

1273
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:46,390
to accept the things

1274
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:46,390
I cannot change,

1275
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:50,950
"the courage to

1276
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:50,950
change the things I can..."

1277
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:52,590
And?

1278
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,490
"And the wisdom

1279
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,490
to know the difference."

1280
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:04,540
But even if they put his

1281
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:04,540
DNA into their database,

1282
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,580
doesn't it take

1283
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,580
a really long time

1284
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,580
to get the results back?

1285
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:08,270
I'm expediting

1286
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:08,270
the order.

1287
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:10,340
Rush processing.

1288
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:13,280
It's gonna cost us triple,

1289
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:13,280
but we'll have an answer

1290
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:13,280
by this week.

1291
00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:16,580
I realize Auggie is low

1292
00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:16,580
on the transplant list,

1293
00:38:16,690 --> 00:38:17,820
but pinning our hopes

1294
00:38:16,690 --> 00:38:17,820
on finding

1295
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,020
some long-lost relative?

1296
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:22,390
Ben, the Internet

1297
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:22,390
is flooded with stories

1298
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:25,830
of people who have

1299
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:25,830
found family members

1300
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:25,830
through DNA databases.

1301
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:27,860
This is gonna work.

1302
00:38:27,970 --> 00:38:28,990
How can you be so sure?

1303
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:30,290
Because

1304
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:32,700
it has to.

1305
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,310
You get Goodwin's text?

1306
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:47,350
"My office. Now."

1307
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:50,520
So, I guess this is it.

1308
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:54,800
Yep, let's get this

1309
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:54,800
over with.

1310
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:54,800
Okay.

1311
00:38:54,890 --> 00:38:58,660
You know, Manning,

1312
00:38:54,890 --> 00:38:58,660
I put you in an impossible

1313
00:38:54,890 --> 00:38:58,660
position today.

1314
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:02,760
When Goodwin

1315
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:02,760
lays the hammer,

1316
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:02,760
I take the fall.

1317
00:39:03,370 --> 00:39:04,390
Noble,

1318
00:39:05,370 --> 00:39:06,810
but I chose

1319
00:39:05,370 --> 00:39:06,810
to scrub in with you.

1320
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:08,900
So, whatever happens,

1321
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:08,900
happens to us both.

1322
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:12,870
Okay.

1323
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,820
I don't even know

1324
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,820
where to begin.

1325
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:21,450
My dismay at the risk

1326
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:21,450
you put your patient in,

1327
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:23,390
or the headache I have

1328
00:39:23,490 --> 00:39:27,790
from Dr. Gillin screaming

1329
00:39:23,490 --> 00:39:27,790
about how furious she is!

1330
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:32,970
And by the way,

1331
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:32,970
her anger is justified!

1332
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:36,040
That said...

1333
00:39:36,370 --> 00:39:39,400
Incredible job.

1334
00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:41,530
We're not fired?

1335
00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:45,510
Trust me, you came

1336
00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:45,510
very, very close.

1337
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:48,840
The board was with

1338
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:48,840
Dr. Gillin, they wanted

1339
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:48,840
to see you two gone.

1340
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,420
But I helped them see

1341
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,420
there's no PR value

1342
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:54,750
in a successful

1343
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:54,750
ex-vivo surgery

1344
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:56,650
if you fire the two heroes

1345
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:56,650
of the day.

1346
00:39:57,690 --> 00:40:00,460
Thank you, Miss Goodwin.

1347
00:39:57,690 --> 00:40:00,460
Thank you.

1348
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:04,100
Hey, Ma.

1349
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:04,100
Ready to go home?

1350
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:04,100
Yeah.

1351
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:07,800
Get outta here.

1352
00:40:08,470 --> 00:40:09,960
Ma'am.

1353
00:40:08,470 --> 00:40:09,960
Good night.

1354
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:18,770
Oh, so, that's where

1355
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:18,770
you've been.

1356
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:20,940
You okay?

1357
00:40:22,450 --> 00:40:23,750
It is what it is,

1358
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:27,510
but a hundred patient

1359
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:27,510
files here,

1360
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:27,510
and more on the way.

1361
00:40:27,650 --> 00:40:31,590
Still, I'm sorry. I know

1362
00:40:27,650 --> 00:40:31,590
you had to make a deal

1363
00:40:27,650 --> 00:40:31,590
you didn't really want to.

1364
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:33,390
End of the day,

1365
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:33,390
it's about saving lives.

1366
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:37,160
Hmm. The trial needs

1367
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:37,160
a chance to prove

1368
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:37,160
the drug can work.

1369
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:38,900
Mayfield's patients

1370
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:38,900
guarantee that.

1371
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:41,700
Well, I'm done for the day.

1372
00:40:41,970 --> 00:40:44,030
I can help you start sorting

1373
00:40:41,970 --> 00:40:44,030
through those files.

1374
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:46,840
Thanks, April.

1375
00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:55,640
Oh, my God, I thought

1376
00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:55,640
it was over for us today.

1377
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:56,740
Yeah. Me, too.
