1
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:07,430
Our drug can give people

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:07,430
their lives back.

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,160
Mr. Booker, we'll have

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,160
answers for you soon.

5
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:12,570
You could have

6
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:12,570
a bright future

7
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:12,570
running clinical trials.

8
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:15,600
I'm flattered, really.

9
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:18,440
Auggie is running

10
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:18,440
out of time, Sharon.

11
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:21,020
Weren't you looking to see

12
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:21,020
if he had any relatives?

13
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:23,380
Only a family member

14
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:23,380
can consent to the transplant.

15
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,490
We've decided

16
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,490
to adopt Auggie.

17
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:28,180
I'll sign off

18
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:28,180
on the surgery.

19
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:31,720
I lost my daughter

20
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:31,720
to leukemia

21
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:31,720
about ten years ago.

22
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:35,460
I don't talk about this

23
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:35,460
with many people.

24
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:38,630
Oh, baby.

25
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:42,360
No.

26
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:21,410
Dr. Virani?

27
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:24,210
I just examined

28
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:24,210
trial patient CM 42,

29
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:24,210
Alvin Booker,

30
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:26,510
and I am very encouraged.

31
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:28,480
His ejection fraction

32
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:28,480
is up, BP's stable.

33
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:30,680
EKG showed no PVC's,

34
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:30,680
normal sinus rhythm.

35
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:33,180
And he is not complaining

36
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:33,180
of any side effects.

37
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,450
Great.

38
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,390
Yeah, he's only been

39
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,390
in the trial a week,

40
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:37,820
and given this degree

41
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:37,820
of improvement,

42
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:39,490
I've to assume

43
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:39,490
he's getting the medication.

44
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,760
We'll see.

45
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:44,100
But this is all good news.

46
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:44,100
Thanks, Will.

47
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:46,460
All right.

48
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:46,460
Now, you take care, okay?

49
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,430
Mr. Booker,

50
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,430
I'll see you next week.

51
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,100
You bet, Doc.

52
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,100
Bye, Alvin.

53
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:54,210
Hey. Thanks for getting him

54
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:54,210
in the trial again.

55
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:56,300
No reason

56
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:56,300
he shouldn't have been.

57
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:57,500
I'm just glad it worked out.

58
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,670
Hey.

59
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:03,340
You seen Ethan?

60
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:03,340
I have a requisition

61
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:03,340
for him to sign.

62
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:04,440
He's gonna be late.

63
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:06,250
He called and said he had a

64
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:06,250
personal matter to attend to.

65
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:07,550
You're joking, right?

66
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,620
No. Why?

67
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:12,560
He's here 24/7. He doesn't

68
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:12,560
have a personal life.

69
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,390
How can he have

70
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,390
a personal matter?

71
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,860
Always a kind word.

72
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,840
Hey.

73
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,570
You okay?

74
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,570
Yeah.

75
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,170
Uh...

76
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,610
You remember how I told you

77
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,610
that, uh, my ex-wife,

78
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:34,480
she came to drop

79
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:34,480
something off?

80
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:34,480
Yeah.

81
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:37,810
It was a box of our

82
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:37,810
daughter's things, right?

83
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,220
Claire thought maybe

84
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,220
I'd find some joy

85
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,220
in remembering, you know?

86
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:45,130
But the thing

87
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:45,130
about it is, I...

88
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,460
I can't bring myself to...

89
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,900
I can't deal with

90
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,900
what's inside that box.

91
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,900
I don't know why.

92
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,130
I get it.

93
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,130
Yeah.

94
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:56,290
Dr. Manning?

95
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:56,290
Yeah?

96
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:57,900
Check your iPad.

97
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:57,900
Oh. Thank you.

98
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:04,540
If you're not headed up

99
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:04,540
to the OR, what do you say?

100
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:06,380
You wanna go practice

101
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:06,380
some real medicine?

102
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,280
You bet.

103
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,280
Let's do it.

104
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:10,780
Show me how it's done.

105
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,250
Mr. Kelton?

106
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:15,280
Hi, I'm Dr. Manning.

107
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:15,280
This is Dr. Marcel.

108
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,150
Hi.

109
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,150
I'm Tim.

110
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:19,660
My boyfriend. He brought me.

111
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,320
Well, that doesn't

112
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,320
sound fun.

113
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:22,590
You're COVID negative, though.

114
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,260
One thing we don't

115
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,260
have to worry about.

116
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:27,300
BP 101/67.

117
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:27,300
Heart rate 112.

118
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,630
Sats 93 on 2 liters oxygen.

119
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:33,470
Okay. Let's get a chest X-ray?

120
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:33,470
And you're having trouble

121
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:33,470
breathing.

122
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:36,700
Your temperature looks good,

123
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:36,700
but it says you're

124
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:36,700
having night sweats.

125
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:40,370
I've had bronchitis before,

126
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:40,370
wasn't this bad.

127
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,810
Okay. Um, sir, would you mind

128
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,810
standing back, please?

129
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:44,210
All right, clear.

130
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:53,460
Yeah.

131
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,430
Right middle lobe.

132
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,430
Pleural effusions.

133
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:57,790
It looks like

134
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:57,790
you have pneumonia.

135
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,730
Um, do you mind

136
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,730
if I take a listen?

137
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:08,440
Decreased breath sounds

138
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:08,440
on the right side.

139
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,940
God, does he need

140
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,940
to be admitted?

141
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,240
Maybe not.

142
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:13,470
I'd like to see how he

143
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:13,470
reacts to the antibiotics.

144
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,780
Ceftriaxone two grams IV

145
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,780
and one gram azithromycin.

146
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,480
Let's also get him

147
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,480
a nebulizer treatment.

148
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:20,850
That'll help

149
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:20,850
with your breathing.

150
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:24,920
And let's get him a CBC, CMP,

151
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:24,920
coags, D-dimer and an ABG.

152
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:26,690
Sounds like a lot.

153
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,320
It really is

154
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,320
the standard fare.

155
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:31,630
Okay, try not to worry.

156
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:31,630
This is manageable, okay?

157
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:34,370
We'll be back to check

158
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:34,370
on you shortly.

159
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:40,530
This real medicine,

160
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:40,530
you're pretty good at it.

161
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:44,710
Darryl, Vera.

162
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:46,370
Hey, Dr. Halstead.

163
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,740
What seems

164
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,740
to be the trouble?

165
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:50,680
She's not right.

166
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:50,680
She's not herself.

167
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:53,960
Heart rate's 85, BP's 130/70.

168
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:57,250
I noticed her ankles

169
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:57,250
are swollen and her

170
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:57,250
jugular's distended.

171
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,890
Hey, Vera, do you know

172
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,890
where you are?

173
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,760
White coats...

174
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,760
See?

175
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,630
Hey, increase her supplemental

176
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,630
O2 to six liters.

177
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:16,680
Vera, do you know who I am?

178
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:18,410
Pastor?

179
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:21,570
Honey, no,

180
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:21,570
it's Dr. Halstead,

181
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:21,570
from the trial.

182
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:23,650
Is it okay if I listen

183
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:23,650
to your chest?

184
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:24,880
Okay.

185
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:24,880
All right.

186
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:35,060
Hearing an S3 gallop

187
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:35,060
and water in the lungs.

188
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,730
That's why

189
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,730
she's short of breath.

190
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:38,920
Why's this happening to her?

191
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:38,920
Why's she like this?

192
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,590
I don't know.

193
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,590
Is it the pills

194
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,590
you gave her?

195
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:44,560
I don't know

196
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:44,560
what's causing it,

197
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:44,560
but I'm gonna find out.

198
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:49,470
Chest X-ray, tox screen, CBC,

199
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:49,470
BMP, BNP and troponins.

200
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:51,310
Also, ten milligrams

201
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:51,310
of IV Lasix.

202
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:52,970
Right.

203
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:52,970
I'll be back when I know more.

204
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,780
Okay, you just rest, Vera.

205
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,080
Doris.

206
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,080
Yeah?

207
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,750
Page Dr. Virani right away.

208
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,750
What's up?

209
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,720
My patient, Vera Johnson,

210
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,720
is in our drug trial.

211
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,820
She's very ill, and it's not

212
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,820
straight up heart failure.

213
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:07,420
Yeah.

214
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,070
All right, Auggie.

215
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,000
I'm gonna go

216
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,000
to work now, okay?

217
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,350
Okay.

218
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,350
I need you to

219
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,350
finish your eggs.

220
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:30,340
'Cause we're gonna

221
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:30,340
be taking you home

222
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:30,340
in about two weeks.

223
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,450
I want you to get

224
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,450
your strength back.

225
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:33,810
All right?

226
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,780
Morning.

227
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,780
Hey.

228
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:40,520
Hey, Dad.

229
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:42,790
"Dad"? I like the sound

230
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:42,790
of that.

231
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:45,690
You don't have to go in?

232
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,100
Teaching online today.

233
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:48,890
Brought us a couple of

234
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,060
Choose Your Own

235
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,060
Adventure books.

236
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:52,470
What do you like?

237
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:57,640
Prisoners of the Ant People

238
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:57,640
or The Lost Jewels of Nabooti?

239
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:59,140
Hmm.

240
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:59,140
Nabooti!

241
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:01,980
The Ant People.

242
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,420
Oh, okay.

243
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,850
All right, I'm gonna

244
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,850
leave you two.

245
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:08,050
Go save some lives.

246
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:08,050
I am.

247
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,060
Bye, sweetie. Okay.

248
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,060
Bye.

249
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:17,820
Dr. Choi,

250
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:17,820
the requisition?

251
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:21,460
You okay?

252
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:24,130
Yeah. Uh... Pulled a muscle

253
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:24,130
working out.

254
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,710
That's why I don't exercise.

255
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,710
It'll kill you.

256
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:31,940
She's suffering

257
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:31,940
volume overload.

258
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:33,170
Her electrolytes

259
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:33,170
are out of whack.

260
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,950
She's confused

261
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,950
and disoriented.

262
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:36,880
History of dementia?

263
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:36,880
No.

264
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,680
Her sodium's still low.

265
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:40,950
Hang another ten

266
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:40,950
of Lasix

267
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,850
and start her

268
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,850
on hypertonic saline.

269
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:44,720
One of your trial patients?

270
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:46,550
Yeah. First one I enrolled.

271
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:52,460
You all right?

272
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:52,460
Yeah. Um, these symptoms

273
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:52,460
are troubling.

274
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:55,530
You think it's an adverse

275
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:55,530
reaction to the medication?

276
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,960
Could be,

277
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,960
but I don't know yet.

278
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:02,200
In any case, I'll need

279
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:02,200
to inform Kender.

280
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:02,200
We may have a problem.

281
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:04,100
I'll work her up.

282
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:04,100
Let you know what I find.

283
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,450
Hold on. She's my patient.

284
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,810
She came in as

285
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,810
an ED patient, not a trial.

286
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,650
I don't see how that matters.

287
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:15,950
Dr. Halstead is familiar with

288
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:15,950
the patient. Maybe he should

289
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:15,950
be the one to work her up.

290
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:19,190
Yeah, that's fine.

291
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:19,190
Excuse me.

292
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:22,460
Thanks.

293
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:27,660
Dr. Abrams.

294
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:27,660
Good morning.

295
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:29,500
Ms. Goodwin, is it me,

296
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:33,040
or are this year's first-year

297
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:33,040
residents even less competent

298
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:33,040
than last year's?

299
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:35,730
You know,

300
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:35,730
you ask me that every year.

301
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:42,120
Doesn't mean

302
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:42,120
it isn't the case.

303
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:46,550
Hey, Crockett.

304
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:46,550
Yeah?

305
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:48,180
My patient, Ron Kelton.

306
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:48,180
Mmm-hmm.

307
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:50,920
His latest X-ray shows

308
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:50,920
the pneumonia is

309
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:50,920
starting to resolve.

310
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,960
Good.

311
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,960
No, but look at this.

312
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,800
Yeah. Right middle lobe

313
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,800
still has an infiltrate.

314
00:08:58,900 --> 00:08:59,960
Yeah.

315
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:01,800
In line with community

316
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:01,800
acquired pneumonia.

317
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:04,240
His latest blood work

318
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:04,240
shows procalcitonin is normal.

319
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:06,070
His cells aren't

320
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:06,070
fighting off bacteria.

321
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:08,830
Which makes me think

322
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:08,830
that even though

323
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:08,830
the pneumonia is better...

324
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:09,930
Something else is going on.

325
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,140
Right.

326
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:14,250
Should scan chest

327
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:14,250
and abdomen.

328
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:16,880
That was my thought. Thanks.

329
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:16,880
All right.

330
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:18,880
Dr. Choi, Dr. Lanik.

331
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,520
Two peds versus auto.

332
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,520
You're going to Trauma Two.

333
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:30,130
Paul Beller, 35,

334
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:30,130
COVID negative, contusions

335
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:30,130
and abrasions, GCS 15.

336
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:31,820
Where's that guy?

337
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:31,820
They bringing him

338
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:31,820
here, too?

339
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:33,800
Heart rate 80, BP 128/84.

340
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,600
I'm okay. I didn't need

341
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,600
to come to the hospital.

342
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,730
If he's here...

343
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,000
We just want to

344
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,000
check you out.

345
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,840
Jim, can you take...

346
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,840
Don't let him near me.

347
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,740
Mags said

348
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,740
there were two.

349
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,740
Right behind us.

350
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,670
I can't go anywhere.

351
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,670
I can't do anything.

352
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:46,680
He's always following me.

353
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:46,680
Male,

354
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:46,680
50 years, Richard Cohen.

355
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:47,910
Dr. Richard Cohen.

356
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,180
COVID negative.

357
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,180
GCS 14. Vitals good.

358
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:54,080
Don't let Mason find me.

359
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:54,080
Don't tell anyone I'm here.

360
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,160
What's going on?

361
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,160
Other guy, Beller,

362
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,160
minding his business,

363
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:58,660
comes out of the post office,

364
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:58,660
suddenly, this clown

365
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:58,660
starts yelling,

366
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,780
chases him into the street.

367
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,330
Car comes around the corner,

368
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,330
clips them both.

369
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:04,600
Don't be fooled.

370
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:04,600
It was Mason.

371
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:04,600
That's who it was.

372
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,330
Thought I should

373
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,330
escort him in,

374
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,330
didn't know what he'd do next.

375
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:08,800
Thanks. We're good.

376
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:08,800
Let's transfer on my count.

377
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,700
Ready? One, two, three.

378
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:12,970
He had this with him.

379
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,240
He's gonna find me.

380
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,240
Always does.

381
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:16,310
Dr. Cohen,

382
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:16,310
I need to examine you.

383
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:16,310
Is that all right?

384
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:18,240
Of course. All those

385
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:18,240
know-nothings out there,

386
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:19,680
spouting their ignorance.

387
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:21,920
I listen to science.

388
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:21,920
Okay. Okay.

389
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,810
Can you move your head

390
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,810
from side to side?

391
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,350
Good. Up and down?

392
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,350
Mmm.

393
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:28,950
Good. The C-spine's cleared.

394
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:31,360
He thinks he can fool me

395
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:31,360
with these disguises.

396
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:32,850
I see right through them.

397
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,800
We're gonna roll you,

398
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,800
all right?

399
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,800
All right, ready? Roll.

400
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:38,230
Oh!

401
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:38,230
Back.

402
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:40,990
Tell me, Dr. Cohen,

403
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:40,990
where do you practice?

404
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,970
I'm not a medical doctor.

405
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:44,730
He has a Cole University ID.

406
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,870
I run the Neuroscience Lab.

407
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,940
Dr. Choi.

408
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:52,070
Dr. Cohen, what are those?

409
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:54,080
None of your business.

410
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:54,080
Put those back?

411
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:55,710
Lungs are clear.

412
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:57,850
Add a tox screen

413
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:57,850
to the standard blood work.

414
00:10:57,950 --> 00:10:58,980
Also chest and pelvic X-ray.

415
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,880
Dr. Cohen, I don't think

416
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,880
you sustained

417
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,880
any serious injuries,

418
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:03,960
but I'm gonna have

419
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:03,960
another doctor come in

420
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:03,960
and talk to you, okay?

421
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:05,080
Long as it's not Mason.

422
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:08,060
No. His name is Dr. Charles,

423
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:08,060
and I think he can help you.

424
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,930
I'll check in on you later.

425
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,830
Stay here until

426
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,830
Dr. Charles comes.

427
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,350
There you go.

428
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,350
Thank you.

429
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:41,420
Made it.

430
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:41,420
Excellent.

431
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:43,790
Um, can I have a black?

432
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:43,790
Thank you, ma'am.

433
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,090
How's Auggie doing?

434
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,090
Good.

435
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:46,360
Yeah?

436
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:46,360
He's good.

437
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:47,700
And the adoption?

438
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:51,970
It's good.

439
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:51,970
All the paperwork is in, and

440
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:51,970
we had our first interview.

441
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:53,060
I think it went well.

442
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,680
Great, great!

443
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:55,870
Look who's here.

444
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:58,210
Hey, son.

445
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:58,210
Hey, Ma.

446
00:11:58,310 --> 00:11:59,800
Maggie.

447
00:11:58,310 --> 00:11:59,800
Michael.

448
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,110
Scrubbing in today?

449
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,110
Yeah.

450
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:04,680
Surgeon's implanting

451
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:04,680
one of our shunts.

452
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:04,680
Sure feels good to be back.

453
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:05,840
Good.

454
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:07,860
I gotta go, Ma.

455
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:07,860
Love you, too.

456
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,980
Good seeing you, Maggie.

457
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:10,320
Nice seeing you, Michael.

458
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:11,760
Thank you.

459
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:12,850
He's enthusiastic.

460
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,930
Yeah, this past year

461
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,930
was pretty tough

462
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,930
on him, though.

463
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:19,900
Getting furloughed

464
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:19,900
and having to move back home,

465
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,770
just when his life

466
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,770
was really moving forward.

467
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
It's been like that

468
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
for a lot of people.

469
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:27,170
I know. It's that,

470
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:27,170
of all my children,

471
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:30,010
Michael's taken

472
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:30,010
the longest to find himself.

473
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:33,840
He did not

474
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:33,840
need this pandemic.

475
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:35,780
I'll tell you, Maggie,

476
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:40,080
you never stop worrying

477
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:40,080
about them, no matter

478
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:40,080
how old they get.

479
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:42,490
Their health, their happiness.

480
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,030
Still, it's all worth it.

481
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:47,460
My children

482
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:50,930
are the greatest joy

483
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:50,930
in my life.

484
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,990
When I look at Auggie,

485
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,000
I know what you mean.

486
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,280
Hey, Jim.

487
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:09,910
The patient's injuries

488
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:09,910
are superficial,

489
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:12,150
so, I'm downgrading

490
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:12,150
and discharging him.

491
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,850
His name is definitely

492
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,850
not Mason.

493
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:15,890
It's Beller. He doesn't even

494
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:15,890
know anyone named Mason,

495
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:19,760
and he's never met

496
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:19,760
that nutjob who chased him

497
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:19,760
into the street.

498
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:21,360
By the way, Ethan,

499
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:21,360
you look like hell.

500
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,430
Didn't sleep well last night.

501
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,260
I told you being chief's

502
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,260
no picnic.

503
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:27,060
Yeah.

504
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:28,960
Hey.

505
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:30,970
What do you make of Dr. Cohen?

506
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:32,100
I checked him out.

507
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:34,370
His credentials

508
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:34,370
are totally legit.

509
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,780
He certainly knows more about

510
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,780
neuroscience than I ever will.

511
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:39,440
Were you able to locate

512
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:39,440
any of his family?

513
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:40,950
A daughter,

514
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:40,950
she's on her way in.

515
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,090
Oh, good. Far as I can tell,

516
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:47,350
he is suffering

517
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:47,350
from one of the

518
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:47,350
misidentification disorders.

519
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,790
There are several,

520
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,790
but basically, the idea is,

521
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,790
you look at somebody

522
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:52,450
and you genuinely believe

523
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:52,450
they are somebody else.

524
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:54,500
This Mason

525
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:54,500
he keeps referring to.

526
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,830
Right. A colleague, I guess,

527
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,830
who he thinks

528
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,830
is out to destroy him.

529
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:01,800
Look, he's clearly delusional.

530
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:01,800
Question is, why?

531
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:01,800
What's causing it?

532
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:02,960
It can be physical,

533
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,830
a tumor, brain injury,

534
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,830
but it can also be chemical.

535
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,500
We're waiting

536
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,500
on the tox screen.

537
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,500
Yeah.

538
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:10,580
We should start with that,

539
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:10,580
but be prepared

540
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:10,580
to do a full work-up.

541
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:11,870
You got it.

542
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:11,870
All right.

543
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,570
Are you okay, buddy?

544
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:14,870
Yeah.

545
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:14,870
Yeah?

546
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:15,970
Yeah.

547
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:15,970
Okay.

548
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:23,860
You can wait down here.

549
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:23,860
The CT won't be long.

550
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,260
He'll be back soon.

551
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,260
Okay.

552
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,560
Don't worry.

553
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,190
You're the strongest person

554
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,190
I know.

555
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,990
He swims 30 laps every day.

556
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:35,260
Not every day.

557
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,430
Let's go.

558
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,580
Dr. Marcel.

559
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,580
Yeah?

560
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:53,110
Ron is a very special person.

561
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:54,980
Before we met,

562
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,320
I'd kind of given up

563
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,320
on having a real relationship.

564
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:01,890
He's been a gift in my life.

565
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:05,130
We don't know

566
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:05,130
if anything serious

567
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:05,130
is going on.

568
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:07,130
We're just covering

569
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:07,130
all our bases.

570
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,240
Okay?

571
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,240
Okay.

572
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:11,460
Don't worry.

573
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:24,010
Her electrolytes

574
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:24,010
are slightly better,

575
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:24,010
but not much.

576
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,180
My lights are bright.

577
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:29,190
Honey, not "lights,"

578
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:29,190
"electrolytes."

579
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,060
There's been

580
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,060
no significant change.

581
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:39,630
Despite upping her

582
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:39,630
diuretics and the saline?

583
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,400
You haven't been able

584
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,400
to determine the cause

585
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,400
of her symptoms?

586
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,970
Still working on it.

587
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:47,500
It could be

588
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:47,500
an adverse reaction

589
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:47,500
to the medication.

590
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,630
We don't even know

591
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,630
if she's getting

592
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,630
the medication.

593
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:52,210
We need to unblind

594
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:52,210
her then. Find out.

595
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:53,610
That's the protocol.

596
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:53,610
Hold on.

597
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:56,010
If we unblind her,

598
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:56,010
she'll be pulled

599
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:56,010
from the trial.

600
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:57,240
She'll be taken off

601
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:57,240
the medication,

602
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:59,680
which might be helping her,

603
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:59,680
and we'll lose all her data.

604
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:02,990
Besides, we don't even know

605
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:02,990
how Kender's Safety Board

606
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:02,990
will react.

607
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:04,490
They might pause

608
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:04,490
the trial altogether.

609
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:06,390
I don't think that we have

610
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:06,390
a choice, Will.

611
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:09,020
We need to find out

612
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:09,020
if the medication

613
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:09,020
is causing this.

614
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:11,190
Sabeena, no one in the trial

615
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:11,190
has had symptoms like this.

616
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,560
I don't think

617
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,560
it's the medication.

618
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:18,040
Give me a couple

619
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:18,040
more hours to find

620
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:18,040
an alternate diagnosis.

621
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:19,700
For her sake

622
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:19,700
and for everyone else's.

623
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:22,940
Please.

624
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:25,980
I'll give you

625
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:25,980
to the end of the day.

626
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:28,480
But if her

627
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:28,480
condition worsens...

628
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:28,480
I know. Thanks.

629
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:38,690
Scan's up.

630
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:38,690
There's a mass.

631
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,120
And enlarged lymph nodes.

632
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:43,150
Damn it.

633
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:45,060
Second cancer in two days.

634
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:48,030
There's a chance

635
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:48,030
it could be sarcoidosis.

636
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,630
Cold comfort,

637
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,630
and highly unlikely.

638
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:54,170
No, we need an endobronchial

639
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:54,170
ultrasound biopsy to confirm.

640
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:05,350
Mason, you bastard!

641
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:07,220
You don't fool me!

642
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:07,220
I know it's you!

643
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,350
Careful. Hey, hey!

644
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,290
I know it was...

645
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,290
Get this guy away from me!

646
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:11,520
Dr. Charles.

647
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:11,520
I told you he'd find me!

648
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:13,060
Get back in bed.

649
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:13,060
You didn't listen! I told you!

650
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,180
Get back in bed.

651
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,180
No!

652
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,460
Please, Dr. Cohen,

653
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,460
we're trying to help you.

654
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:18,660
Don't let him near me!

655
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:18,660
Keep him away!

656
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:21,170
Keep who away?

657
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:21,170
Mason!

658
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,360
That's him! That's Mason!

659
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:25,500
I don't know what

660
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:25,500
he's talking about.

661
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:25,500
Liar!

662
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:27,540
I went in there

663
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:27,540
to restock the supplies.

664
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,740
You see? He won't

665
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,740
leave me alone!

666
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,270
Restraints, please.

667
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,270
Nice and easy.

668
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:34,580
When will he stop? When?

669
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,780
Five of Haldol, two of Ativan.

670
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,780
Got it.

671
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:39,420
It's horrible.

672
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,280
I can't go anywhere.

673
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,280
I can't do anything.

674
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:44,350
He follows me everywhere.

675
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:47,290
Always out there.

676
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:54,430
Remember when I said

677
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:54,430
there were several of these

678
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,440
misidentification disorders?

679
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,440
Yeah.

680
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:59,030
I think we're dealing

681
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:59,030
with Fregoli, okay?

682
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:01,740
Which was named

683
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:01,740
for a 19th century

684
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:01,740
quick change artist.

685
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:04,140
It's the delusion

686
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:04,140
that somebody

687
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:04,140
who is persecuting you

688
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,240
has the ability to change

689
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,240
their appearance.

690
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:09,810
First, he thought

691
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:09,810
that Mason was Beller.

692
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:09,810
Now, it's Doris. Whoa, Ethan!

693
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:12,550
Ethan! A little help here!

694
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:14,320
Ethan!

695
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:14,320
Dr. Choi?

696
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:16,450
Okay. Let's lay him down.

697
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:16,450
All right, Ethan?

698
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,280
Let's get a room.

699
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,090
I'm on it.

700
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,090
Ethan!

701
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:22,490
Ethan, can you hear me?

702
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:32,360
Ethan, what's going on?

703
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:32,360
I need a minute to rest.

704
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:34,770
Yeah, you think?

705
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:34,770
102.6. You're burning up.

706
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,780
Start an IV,

707
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,780
hang a thousand Tylenol

708
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,780
and fluids.

709
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:40,610
Dr. Charles.

710
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,720
He's had surgery.

711
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:45,580
Ethan, what procedure

712
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:45,580
did you have?

713
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:47,810
Gallbladder.

714
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,130
How long ago?

715
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,130
This morning.

716
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:52,780
This morning?

717
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:52,780
Why aren't you in recovery?

718
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:54,420
I thought I could manage.

719
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:56,520
Who's your surgeon?

720
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:56,520
Hamad. East Mercy.

721
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:58,260
He discharged you?

722
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:58,260
No, I left.

723
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:00,430
Dr. Charles, I found these

724
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:00,430
on the floor.

725
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:02,440
Cipro.

726
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:02,440
It's no big deal.

727
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:04,370
No big deal?

728
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:04,370
You know

729
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:04,370
you look septic.

730
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:07,570
Probably having bile spillage.

731
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:07,570
These aren't gonna cut it.

732
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,740
Give him 1,000 of Rocephin

733
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,740
and 500 of Flagyl.

734
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:12,400
What made you do

735
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:12,400
something so crazy?

736
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:14,310
I just wanted to

737
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:14,310
get back to work.

738
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:17,480
That's not gonna happen

739
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:17,480
any time soon, because

740
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:17,480
we're gonna admit you.

741
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:19,710
Do I understand

742
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:19,710
this correctly?

743
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:21,380
He wakes up from anesthesia,

744
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:23,420
puts his clothes on

745
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:23,420
and comes back to work?

746
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,290
It's just like Ethan.

747
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:34,430
Hang on. There's the mass.

748
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,160
Partially obstructing

749
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,160
his bronchiole.

750
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:38,640
It might just be

751
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:38,640
the tip of the iceberg.

752
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:40,170
Switch to 3D.

753
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:42,440
See how far

754
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:42,440
into the wall it goes.

755
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:43,910
It extends into

756
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:43,910
the parenchyma.

757
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,710
Not unexpected.

758
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:46,870
Capturing image.

759
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:50,280
1.2 centimeters.

760
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:52,380
Forceps coming.

761
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:53,780
Nice and easy.

762
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,920
Good. Open.

763
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:00,190
And close.

764
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,430
Thank you.

765
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,590
Run it to pathology.

766
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:06,260
On its way.

767
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,670
Hey.

768
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:17,240
You hear about Ethan?

769
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:20,370
Yeah, pretty crazy. Poor guy.

770
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,810
I gotta leave

771
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,810
for about an hour.

772
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:26,480
I need you to cover for me.

773
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:26,480
What about Mrs. Johnson?

774
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:28,210
It's for Mrs. Johnson.

775
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,790
I know the chemical structure

776
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,790
of the trial medication.

777
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:34,230
I'm taking her blood

778
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:34,230
to an outside lab,

779
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:35,820
to see if it contains

780
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:35,820
the drug's signature.

781
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:37,660
That way, we will know

782
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:37,660
if she's on it or not.

783
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:40,830
Hold on, you're unblinding her

784
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:40,830
without the company knowing?

785
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:41,930
You cannot do that.

786
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,830
April, I do not think

787
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,830
her condition is caused

788
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,830
by the drug.

789
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:46,810
But I need to know,

790
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:46,810
one way or not,

791
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:46,810
if she's on it.

792
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:48,810
If she's not, that'll help

793
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:48,810
narrow things down

794
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:50,740
and help me look for the real

795
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:50,740
cause of the symptoms.

796
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:52,680
But keeping the company

797
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:52,680
out of the loop,

798
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:54,910
unblinding her on the sly...

799
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:58,250
If Kender learns

800
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:58,250
about this, they will

801
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:58,250
fire you from the trial.

802
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:01,550
If Kender unblinds her,

803
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:01,550
they'll pause the trial

804
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:01,550
altogether.

805
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:03,990
Is that what this is about?

806
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:03,990
Protecting the trial?

807
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:05,620
I'm protecting our patients.

808
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:08,630
Look at Mr. Booker,

809
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:08,630
how well he's doing.

810
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:10,890
I'm not willing to risk him

811
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:10,890
losing this medication.

812
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:11,990
Are you?

813
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,630
Okay, then.

814
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:25,470
Hi. So, we have some news.

815
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:29,680
The mass we discovered

816
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:29,680
in the CT, we biopsied it,

817
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:29,680
it is malignant.

818
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:31,710
Cancer?

819
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:31,710
Yeah.

820
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:34,010
Squamous cell carcinoma.

821
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:35,780
Are you sure?

822
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:40,020
The good news is,

823
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:40,020
it's 1.2 centimeters,

824
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:40,020
not very big.

825
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:42,560
It's resectable, so,

826
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:42,560
we can take it out.

827
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,490
Mmm. The tumor predisposed

828
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,490
you to the pneumonia,

829
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,360
which is actually a blessing,

830
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:49,370
because it allowed us

831
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:49,370
to find the tumor

832
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:49,370
before it grew larger.

833
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:51,500
So, what happens now?

834
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:53,840
We take

835
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:53,840
Ron into surgery and

836
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:53,840
I remove the mass.

837
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:57,310
Hopefully, the lymph nodes

838
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:57,310
are minimally involved.

839
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,850
Yeah. In the meantime,

840
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,850
we'll loop in oncology.

841
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:02,380
After surgery, you may need

842
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:02,380
to start a course of chemo,

843
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:03,640
maybe radiation.

844
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:06,580
Hey.

845
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,320
Who knew pneumonia

846
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,320
could be a good thing?

847
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:18,760
All this really necessary?

848
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:20,990
Oh, don't you worry,

849
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:20,990
we'll have you back

850
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:20,990
on your feet in a jiffy.

851
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:25,000
Dr. C, check your iPad.

852
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:25,000
Richard Cohen's

853
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:25,000
tox screen just came in.

854
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:27,400
And his daughter's here.

855
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:27,400
Thanks, Hank.

856
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:32,740
So, as far as you know,

857
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:32,740
your dad has no history

858
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:32,740
of mental illness?

859
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:34,910
No. Never.

860
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:34,910
Right.

861
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:38,750
His tests did not indicate

862
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:38,750
a physical cause

863
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:38,750
for his mental state,

864
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:42,590
which makes it

865
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:42,590
much more likely that it

866
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:42,590
was chemically induced.

867
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,060
Um, which brings us to these.

868
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,590
Oh, no.

869
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:49,960
Yeah. Even with a tox screen,

870
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:49,960
we weren't able

871
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:49,960
to identify most of them.

872
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:52,970
And I was hoping that

873
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:52,970
you might be able to

874
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:52,970
help us out with that?

875
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:55,470
Some of them.

876
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:55,470
It's my dad's own cocktail.

877
00:22:55,570 --> 00:23:01,100
Uh, Brahmi, Phenibut,

878
00:22:55,570 --> 00:23:01,100
L-carnitine, Piracetam,

879
00:22:55,570 --> 00:23:01,100
Ginkgo.

880
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:03,710
He's always adding more,

881
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:03,710
so, I don't know what else.

882
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:07,710
Uh-huh. So, those are

883
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:07,710
supplements that supposedly

884
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:07,710
have nootropic effect,

885
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:10,340
you know, they increase

886
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:10,340
cognitive function.

887
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:13,650
Do you think your pop

888
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:13,650
might be worried that

889
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:13,650
he's losing his faculties?

890
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:16,720
No. My father's

891
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:16,720
a brilliant man.

892
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:19,060
He got his PhD

893
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:19,060
when he was 22.

894
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,890
But he's always

895
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,890
looked to improve

896
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,890
his mental capacity.

897
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,830
He said these were safe.

898
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:27,730
Theoretically. But when

899
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:27,730
taken together with all

900
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:27,730
of his other medications,

901
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,070
it is possible that they could

902
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,070
have caused a psychotic break.

903
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:33,500
What, psychotic?

904
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:33,500
I know it's a scary word,

905
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:35,970
but it's really just another

906
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:35,970
medical term for delusion.

907
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,600
And I've given him something

908
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,600
to calm him down.

909
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:42,410
And when these leave

910
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:42,410
his system, we really

911
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:42,410
should see a change.

912
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:46,420
You know, most of his

913
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:46,420
delusions have been focused

914
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:46,420
on somebody named Mason.

915
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:49,850
Do you know who that is or why

916
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:49,850
he might be afraid of him?

917
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:53,390
There's no reason at all.

918
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:53,390
Dr. Mason was a colleague.

919
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,530
He was chair

920
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,530
of the department

921
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,530
before my dad.

922
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,960
But he had an aneurism

923
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,960
a year ago.

924
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,420
Dr. Mason is dead.

925
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:07,130
Please keep me posted

926
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:07,130
on Dr. Choi's condition,

927
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:11,040
and let me know

928
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:11,040
when they get him a room

929
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:11,040
on the medical floor.

930
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:12,980
Dr. Abrams,

931
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:12,980
I'm really sorry

932
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:12,980
if I overstepped.

933
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,810
Overstepped?

934
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,810
That's a generous

935
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,810
assessment.

936
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:19,880
Dr. Abrams, something wrong?

937
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:21,680
I've handled it.

938
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:23,750
Please, tell me.

939
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:30,560
He's coaching me

940
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:30,560
on a stent, which is

941
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:30,560
insulting in and of itself,

942
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:34,690
but then he has the

943
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:34,690
temerity to try to upsell me

944
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:34,690
on a new spinalscope.

945
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:37,560
He tried to upsell you

946
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:37,560
during an operation?

947
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:40,140
Look, I know he's your son,

948
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,470
but I can't say that I would

949
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,470
welcome him back to my OR.

950
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:53,610
I just got Mrs. Johnson's

951
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:53,610
blood work back.

952
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:55,550
She's on the medication.

953
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:57,850
What are you gonna do?

954
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:00,550
I have to let Virani

955
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:00,550
officially unblind her.

956
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:02,990
They'll probably

957
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:02,990
stop the trial.

958
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:04,690
I'm sorry.

959
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:07,120
Yeah.

960
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,200
It's Mrs. Johnson.

961
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:14,700
What's wrong with her?

962
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:14,700
She's having a seizure.

963
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:15,970
Five of Ativan.

964
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:17,900
Why's this happening?

965
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:19,140
Likely from low sodium.

966
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:20,810
It causes swelling

967
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:20,810
of the brain.

968
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:25,080
Can't you do

969
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:25,080
something for her?

970
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:25,080
Believe me, we're trying.

971
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:35,260
With everything we've done,

972
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:35,260
diuretics, hypertonic saline,

973
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,720
her sodium shouldn't

974
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,720
still be this low.

975
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:40,530
Nobody else is having

976
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:40,530
symptoms like this

977
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:40,530
in the trial.

978
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:42,760
What am I missing?

979
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:46,000
There is one possibility.

980
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:48,010
With your permission,

981
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:48,010
I'd like to send your wife

982
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:48,010
for a CT scan of her head.

983
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:49,770
What about talking

984
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:49,770
to Dr. Virani?

985
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:51,070
Let's do this first.

986
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:51,070
You sure?

987
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:52,910
Yes. Mr. Johnson,

988
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:52,910
do I have your permission?

989
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:55,810
Uh...

990
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:57,040
Mr. Johnson?

991
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:58,880
If you think it'll help, yes.

992
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,250
Let Radiology know

993
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,250
we're coming up.

994
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:13,960
Well?

995
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:15,760
This is Mrs. Johnson's scan.

996
00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:18,160
Okay.

997
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:20,800
And this is

998
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:20,800
a hypothalamic lesion.

999
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:22,880
A tumor?

1000
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:22,880
I mean, it's small,

1001
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:24,540
but it's pressing

1002
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:24,540
on the pituitary.

1003
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,170
Which explains

1004
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,170
her low sodium.

1005
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:28,710
That's what caused

1006
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:28,710
her seizure.

1007
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:30,610
And not

1008
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:30,610
the trial medication.

1009
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:33,210
If she's on it.

1010
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:36,180
This is great news for us.

1011
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:38,020
But what about Mrs. Johnson?

1012
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:39,220
Once we correct the lesion,

1013
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:41,090
pituitary function

1014
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:41,090
should go back to normal.

1015
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:42,730
So, we won't need

1016
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:42,730
to unblind her.

1017
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,160
No, I don't think

1018
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,160
it's necessary.

1019
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,630
I mean, that is such a relief.

1020
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:52,760
Congratulations. This was

1021
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:52,760
an incredible catch.

1022
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,980
All right,

1023
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,980
got the bleeding

1024
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,980
under control.

1025
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:08,810
Path says

1026
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:08,810
the margins are clean

1027
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:08,810
on the resected mass.

1028
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,580
Where are we with

1029
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,580
the level four nodes?

1030
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:11,680
I'd like to wrap this up.

1031
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:13,730
Hold on. I just

1032
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:13,730
received something.

1033
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:17,160
They're seeing cancerous,

1034
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:17,160
undifferentiated cells.

1035
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,220
Adenosquamous in appearance.

1036
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,220
Damn it.

1037
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:23,130
Have you located

1038
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:23,130
the level seven nodes?

1039
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,100
Yeah.

1040
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,100
And?

1041
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:28,330
Doesn't look great.

1042
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:28,330
I'm going after them.

1043
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:30,180
Get Path on standby.

1044
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,050
Will, you know what

1045
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,050
we did was wrong.

1046
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,610
But we did it for

1047
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,610
the right reasons.

1048
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:42,180
It didn't affect the trial.

1049
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:42,180
It all worked out.

1050
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:43,990
It did all work out.

1051
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:46,390
Behind Dr. Virani's back.

1052
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:48,160
Are you ever gonna tell her?

1053
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:51,090
No, you're right. I should.

1054
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,270
Come in.

1055
00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:00,260
Hey.

1056
00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:00,260
Hey, Ma, what's up?

1057
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:03,040
Uh, I need your

1058
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:03,040
help, Michael.

1059
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:03,040
Sure.

1060
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:08,380
You know, it's my job

1061
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:08,380
to try to make sure this

1062
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:08,380
hospital is run smoothly,

1063
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,950
which isn't always easy,

1064
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:12,880
given

1065
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:12,880
different people's demands

1066
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:12,880
and their egos.

1067
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:15,080
So, what can I do?

1068
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:19,060
I need you to just be

1069
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:19,060
a little more aware.

1070
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:22,230
Aware?

1071
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:22,230
In the OR.

1072
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:25,060
Surgeons are a particular

1073
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:25,060
kind of breed.

1074
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,000
Some of them can be

1075
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,000
easily offended.

1076
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,790
This is about Abrams.

1077
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:32,240
He was using an outmoded

1078
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:32,240
piece of equipment.

1079
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:34,830
I was trying to help the guy.

1080
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:34,830
That's not the point.

1081
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:38,880
I can't have my medical reps

1082
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:38,880
upselling during a procedure.

1083
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:42,680
If that's what

1084
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:42,680
he told you I was doing,

1085
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:42,680
I was not.

1086
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:46,150
It doesn't matter.

1087
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:46,150
That's how

1088
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:46,150
he interpreted it.

1089
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:48,720
I'm trying so hard

1090
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:48,720
to get back on my feet.

1091
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:53,990
Would it be too much to ask

1092
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:53,990
for you to back me up

1093
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:53,990
just a little?

1094
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,220
Listen to me.

1095
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:57,990
This isn't about you.

1096
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:01,030
It's about

1097
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:01,030
hospital protocol.

1098
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,060
Michael?

1099
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:15,120
So, your daughter

1100
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:15,120
is here to see you,

1101
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:18,380
but I thought it might be

1102
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:18,380
a good idea if we just had

1103
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:18,380
a little chat first.

1104
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:20,920
I have a grant proposal

1105
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:20,920
to write,

1106
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:23,350
and to finish my paper

1107
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:23,350
on cortical mapping.

1108
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:25,090
I promise you, I won't take up

1109
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:25,090
too much of your time.

1110
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:27,460
And the faculty evaluation.

1111
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,160
If I don't keep up,

1112
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,160
you know what's gonna happen.

1113
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:31,020
You know, I don't.

1114
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:32,820
He's gonna get my job.

1115
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:36,200
Who's gonna get the job?

1116
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:36,200
Dr. Mason?

1117
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:39,960
He published ten papers

1118
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:39,960
a year, but three more

1119
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:39,960
and I'll have 11.

1120
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:41,060
Right.

1121
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:44,940
So, you feel like you're in

1122
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:44,940
competition with Dr. Mason?

1123
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:48,070
He had my job before.

1124
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:48,070
He wants it back.

1125
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:48,070
Right.

1126
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:51,480
You do know that

1127
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:51,480
he's dead, don't you?

1128
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:54,150
If I get the R01...

1129
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:54,150
Wait, wait.

1130
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:55,480
...that'll really show him.

1131
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:57,160
Dr. Cohen, look at me.

1132
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:59,160
Now, he's not as brilliant

1133
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:59,160
as people say.

1134
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:02,150
Dr. Mason died a year ago.

1135
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:05,890
He's dead.

1136
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:05,890
No, no. He's out there.

1137
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:09,470
No. Dr. Mason

1138
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:09,470
died a year ago,

1139
00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:12,900
from a brain aneurism.

1140
00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:12,900
He's dead.

1141
00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:21,400
He's dead?

1142
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:26,410
I...

1143
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:29,920
I have to do better.

1144
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,790
Why?

1145
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:36,090
I have to. I just have to.

1146
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,190
Wait, is it you don't think

1147
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,190
that you're

1148
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:42,030
as good as Dr. Mason was?

1149
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:44,800
That you don't

1150
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:44,800
deserve his job?

1151
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:49,340
That despite

1152
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:49,340
all of your qualifications,

1153
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:53,380
all your success,

1154
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:53,380
that still, deep down,

1155
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:57,580
you feel, I guess,

1156
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:57,580
inadequate, professionally?

1157
00:30:58,050 --> 00:31:01,080
I work so hard.

1158
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:06,380
I'm so tired.

1159
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,150
I can only imagine.

1160
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:12,560
You know, Dr. Cohen,

1161
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:12,560
I have looked at your CV,

1162
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:16,470
and from all

1163
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:16,470
the evidence I see,

1164
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:21,100
you are much,

1165
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:21,100
much more than adequate.

1166
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,850
And that you don't need

1167
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,850
to compete with anybody.

1168
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:26,540
Alive or dead.

1169
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:36,860
Good night, Michael.

1170
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,550
Michael?

1171
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,220
Night, Maggie.

1172
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:51,510
You know, I was so happy

1173
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:51,510
when Kender placed him here,

1174
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:55,010
and now, I think it might have

1175
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:55,010
been better for both of us

1176
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:57,480
if he'd been assigned

1177
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:57,480
to another hospital.

1178
00:31:57,580 --> 00:32:00,450
What happened?

1179
00:31:57,580 --> 00:32:00,450
We argued.

1180
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:03,110
I tried to talk to him

1181
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:03,110
about surgical protocols.

1182
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:06,280
I had to.

1183
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:06,280
He took it personally.

1184
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:10,920
Michael so much

1185
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:10,920
wants to please me,

1186
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:10,920
to make me proud.

1187
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:14,220
He always has.

1188
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:16,390
So. I'm the one that

1189
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:16,390
could hurt him the most.

1190
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,360
Mmm.

1191
00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:31,000
Hi, Ron.

1192
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:35,140
I'm sorry,

1193
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:35,140
we wish we had

1194
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:35,140
better news.

1195
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:39,580
So, analysis of the samples

1196
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:39,580
we sent to pathology

1197
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:42,490
show

1198
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:42,490
a very aggressive cancer,

1199
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:45,090
which unfortunately,

1200
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:48,030
has metastasized.

1201
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:52,400
We'll test the samples

1202
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:52,400
to determine your best

1203
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:52,400
chemo options.

1204
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:57,370
But given the nature

1205
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:57,370
of your cancer,

1206
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:57,370
we're afraid it won't respond.

1207
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:00,260
We're so sorry.

1208
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,100
This is a...

1209
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:06,980
question

1210
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:11,520
I didn't think I'd be

1211
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:11,520
asking this morning,

1212
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:11,520
but, um...

1213
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,110
How...

1214
00:33:17,290 --> 00:33:19,590
How long do I have?

1215
00:33:17,290 --> 00:33:19,590
Oh, God.

1216
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,020
No.

1217
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,060
I need to know.

1218
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:30,660
How long?

1219
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:35,330
We can't really know for sure.

1220
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,470
Maybe a year.

1221
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,330
99.4.

1222
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,500
Temperature's down.

1223
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,500
How are you feeling?

1224
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:09,200
I'm all right.

1225
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:09,200
Turnover rate

1226
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:09,200
wasn't bad today.

1227
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,700
Oh. That's a relief.

1228
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:14,670
Ethan, this could've been

1229
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:14,670
a lot worse for you.

1230
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,310
Thanks for coming by.

1231
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:23,520
Oh. Nurse Sexton,

1232
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:23,520
guess what? It's official.

1233
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:27,190
By orders of Ms. Goodwin,

1234
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:27,190
Dr. Choi here

1235
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:27,190
is on forced sick leave.

1236
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:29,060
Good.

1237
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:31,360
Gonna have to confiscate

1238
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:31,360
that iPad, buddy.

1239
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:31,360
Come on.

1240
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:33,030
Okay, just turn it off.

1241
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:37,370
So, look, you'll be

1242
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:37,370
happy to hear

1243
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,600
that Dr. Cohen

1244
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,600
is coming out of it.

1245
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,600
Good.

1246
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:40,700
Yeah.

1247
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:44,240
Buddy. What the hell?

1248
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:46,110
Okay.

1249
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:48,810
I realize I shouldn't

1250
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:48,810
have come back so soon

1251
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:48,810
after my operation.

1252
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,310
Why do you think

1253
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,310
you did that?

1254
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:53,240
I'm the chief of the ED.

1255
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:53,240
I have a greater

1256
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:53,240
responsibility.

1257
00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:56,190
We've talked about that.

1258
00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:56,190
What exactly does that mean?

1259
00:34:56,490 --> 00:34:58,620
I have to work

1260
00:34:56,490 --> 00:34:58,620
harder than anyone.

1261
00:34:56,490 --> 00:34:58,620
Huh.

1262
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:02,060
It's funny, Dr. Cohen was just

1263
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:02,060
saying exactly the same thing.

1264
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:05,830
In his case, it was about

1265
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:05,830
proving that he was better

1266
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:05,830
than his predecessor.

1267
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:07,760
I'm not Dr. Cohen.

1268
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:07,760
Of course you're not.

1269
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:09,400
But isn't that something?

1270
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:11,200
This guy,

1271
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:11,200
what's really driving him,

1272
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:13,170
despite all of his success,

1273
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:13,170
all of his achievements,

1274
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:14,710
is that he didn't feel

1275
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:14,710
like he measured up.

1276
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:17,370
So, you're just sharing an

1277
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:17,370
observation about a patient?

1278
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,450
Yeah.

1279
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,450
Here's the ironic part.

1280
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:24,240
It's often the people who are

1281
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:24,240
the very best at what they do,

1282
00:35:24,850 --> 00:35:26,580
who feel the most inadequate.

1283
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:32,650
Look, you have

1284
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:32,650
everything you need?

1285
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:32,650
The right flavored Jell-O?

1286
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:36,600
I'm good.

1287
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:36,600
Okay. I'll check back

1288
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:36,600
on you.

1289
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:41,130
Thanks, Dr. Charles.

1290
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:41,130
Any time.

1291
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:52,740
I'll be back

1292
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:52,740
first thing tomorrow.

1293
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:52,740
Okay.

1294
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:55,880
Bring you breakfast?

1295
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:55,880
Mmm-mmm. I'll get

1296
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:55,880
something here.

1297
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:00,450
Oh.

1298
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:06,220
It's Goodwin. She wants

1299
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:06,220
to see us in her office.

1300
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,760
Now.

1301
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,190
Yeah.

1302
00:36:12,830 --> 00:36:14,160
Come on.

1303
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:20,300
Hey.

1304
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:26,910
You haven't checked

1305
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:26,910
Auggie's Heredity & Me

1306
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:26,910
site recently, have you?

1307
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:30,520
Once we got the transplant,

1308
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:30,520
we didn't see the need.

1309
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:31,770
Why?

1310
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:34,580
It turns out, he has

1311
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:34,580
a brother in California.

1312
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,880
A brother?

1313
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,880
His name is Keshawn.

1314
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:38,560
He's four years older.

1315
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:41,820
His adoptive parents

1316
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:41,820
contacted the hospital and me

1317
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,360
when you didn't respond

1318
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,360
to their post.

1319
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,170
Are you up to meeting them?

1320
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:53,740
Ah. Maxine and Antoine Carter,

1321
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:56,500
Maggie Lockwood

1322
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:56,500
and Ben Campbell,

1323
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:58,540
the couple

1324
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:58,540
we spoke about.

1325
00:36:58,850 --> 00:37:02,510
They're in the process

1326
00:36:58,850 --> 00:37:02,510
of adopting Auggie.

1327
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:05,240
We can't tell you what

1328
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:05,240
this means to Keshawn.

1329
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:09,620
When the boys

1330
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:09,620
went into foster care,

1331
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:09,620
Keshawn was five.

1332
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:14,350
He remembered that he had

1333
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:14,350
a little brother and he

1334
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:14,350
always hoped to find him.

1335
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:17,800
With your permission,

1336
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:17,800
we can fly out,

1337
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:17,800
so the boys can meet.

1338
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:20,800
Oh. Um, of course.

1339
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,530
Auggie'll be thrilled.

1340
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:26,330
That's great. Thank you.

1341
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:26,330
Thank you.

1342
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:37,540
Come in.

1343
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:37,540
Dr. Choi?

1344
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:40,580
Dr. Virani.

1345
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:44,960
I was there

1346
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:44,960
when you took ill.

1347
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:48,830
Uh, I'm sorry

1348
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:48,830
you had to see that.

1349
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:48,830
No. Please.

1350
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:51,420
I just wanted to see

1351
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:51,420
how you were doing.

1352
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:54,700
I'm fine. Thank you.

1353
00:38:00,970 --> 00:38:03,740
You're one of those

1354
00:38:00,970 --> 00:38:03,740
never-say-die types.

1355
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:07,940
I guess.

1356
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:10,310
I get it.

1357
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:15,520
Good night.

1358
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:22,020
Sabeena.

1359
00:38:22,930 --> 00:38:26,890
Hi. I was just

1360
00:38:22,930 --> 00:38:26,890
checking in on Dr. Choi.

1361
00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:30,870
That's what I was

1362
00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:30,870
coming to do. How is he?

1363
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:33,600
On the mend.

1364
00:38:34,410 --> 00:38:35,500
Good.

1365
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,010
Listen, you should know...

1366
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:46,740
There's a restaurant in

1367
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:46,740
my neighborhood opening up

1368
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:46,740
in a couple of weeks

1369
00:38:46,850 --> 00:38:48,820
for those

1370
00:38:46,850 --> 00:38:48,820
that've gotten vaccinated.

1371
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:52,050
What do you say

1372
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:52,050
You want to check it out?

1373
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:56,520
I'd like that.

1374
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,790
Great.

1375
00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:01,770
Okay. Yeah,

1376
00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:01,770
I'll see you tomorrow.

1377
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:03,660
I'll see you tomorrow.

1378
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:16,780
Hey, Crockett.

1379
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:16,780
Hey.

1380
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,440
Don't go just yet.

1381
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:22,420
Um, Ron and Tim

1382
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:22,420
need us to be witnesses

1383
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:22,420
at their wedding.

1384
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:25,490
Wedding?

1385
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:25,490
Yeah. Here. Now.

1386
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:29,860
I mean, do they understand

1387
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:29,860
what they're in for?

1388
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:33,860
Yeah, I think they do.

1389
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:33,860
I mean, best as they can.

1390
00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:37,000
Yeah, but watching

1391
00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:37,000
someone you love suffer,

1392
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,670
and you're helpless

1393
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,670
to do anything, you know?

1394
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:45,350
And after, the empty bed?

1395
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:45,350
The silence and all that?

1396
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:45,350
I don't know.

1397
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:50,510
Yeah, I get it.

1398
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:50,510
But it's worth it,

1399
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:50,510
isn't it?

1400
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:53,740
All right.

1401
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:53,740
Come on, let's go.

1402
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:58,750
Hey.

1403
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:02,120
Thanks so much for coming.

1404
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:02,120
We really appreciate it.

1405
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:04,020
It's not the most

1406
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:04,020
romantic setting,

1407
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:07,760
but we didn't want

1408
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:07,760
to waste a minute.

1409
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:10,690
I understand.

1410
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:14,470
But we decided we'd spend

1411
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:14,470
whatever time I have left

1412
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:16,970
together.

1413
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:21,680
When you love someone,

1414
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,120
so what

1415
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,120
if it's only a year?

1416
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:29,110
You take what you can get.

1417
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:34,060
Shall we begin?

1418
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:38,500
This ceremony

1419
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:38,500
affirms your sacred bond

1420
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:38,500
with one another.

1421
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:41,000
A bond created

1422
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:41,000
by loving purpose...

1423
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:44,570
Happy birthday to you

1424
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:47,800
Happy birthday to you

1425
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:50,970
She loved frosting.

1426
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:54,950
I can see that.

1427
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:54,950
Ooh, it looks good

1428
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:54,950
on her, too.

1429
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,720
Should have seen

1430
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,720
what she could do

1431
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,720
with a bowl of spaghetti.

1432
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:06,080
Wow.

1433
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:07,660
Oh!
