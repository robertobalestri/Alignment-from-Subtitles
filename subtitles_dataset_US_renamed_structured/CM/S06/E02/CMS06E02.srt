1
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:10,970
This job

2
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:10,970
was hard enough before.

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:10,970
Now, it's a nightmare.

4
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:13,630
Well, you're the chief, right?

5
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:13,630
That's your job.

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,570
Are you okay, Crockett?

7
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:18,640
Every time I see kids

8
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:18,640
with leukemia, I think

9
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:18,640
about my little girl.

10
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,010
Dr. Halstead?

11
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,010
Sabeena Virani.

12
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:26,050
We're running a trial at Med.

13
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:26,050
Dr. Ramsey recommended you.

14
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:28,280
Thanks. Another time,

15
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:28,280
I might be interested.

16
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:29,980
I got a lot

17
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:29,980
going on right now.

18
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:32,590
You said drug addicts

19
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:32,590
can replace drugs

20
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:32,590
with romance.

21
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:34,690
You think that's maybe

22
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:34,690
what happened here?

23
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,700
I can't be the reason

24
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,700
you stay sober.

25
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:41,760
Well, a little more leeway

26
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:41,760
would've been nice.

27
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:44,200
All my stuff's packed up

28
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:44,200
and ready to go.

29
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:50,680
Fine. Just let me know.

30
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:50,680
But don't go cashing

31
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:50,680
that deposit check.

32
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:56,050
That apartment I had lined up?

33
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:56,050
Mmm-hmm?

34
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:57,280
It's infested with bed bugs.

35
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,380
Ew.

36
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:00,650
Can't you stay at Hannah's

37
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:00,650
for a few more nights?

38
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:02,190
No. She let her lease go.

39
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:04,690
She's headed

40
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:04,690
for the West Coast

41
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:04,690
when she gets out of rehab.

42
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:08,130
Well, if you need a place

43
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:08,130
to stay, there's always room

44
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:08,130
at Club Med.

45
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:10,430
There's no one in my life

46
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:10,430
I have to quarantine from.

47
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:12,690
It's just me. And my stuff.

48
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:17,440
Here I am,

49
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:17,440
another failed relationship

50
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:17,440
and no place to live.

51
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:19,700
I'm no further along

52
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:19,700
than when I was

53
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:19,700
a first-year resident.

54
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:21,570
I wouldn't go that far.

55
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,150
With Lanik quitting,

56
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,150
you could be named Chief.

57
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:27,140
Me?

58
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,110
No attending's been

59
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,110
in the ED longer than you.

60
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,050
You're a zealot

61
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,050
for your patients.

62
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:32,540
Why not you?

63
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:35,320
I honestly hadn't even

64
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:35,320
thought about it.

65
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:36,780
Well, maybe

66
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:36,780
you should start.

67
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,420
You might get that office.

68
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:42,790
Then you'll have

69
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:42,790
somewhere to put

70
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:42,790
all that stuff of yours.

71
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:46,560
Incoming. It's got

72
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:46,560
your name on it.

73
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,390
What happened?

74
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,730
Jerome Kirk, 56 years old.

75
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,600
Lost control of his car,

76
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,600
hit a lamp post.

77
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:55,140
Rapid tested negative

78
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:55,140
for COVID en route.

79
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:59,370
GCS 14, BP low at 90/60.

80
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:59,370
No breath sounds on the right.

81
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:00,810
I need an X-ray!

82
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:04,320
One, two, three.

83
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:13,630
Yep. Can't hear

84
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:13,630
anything, either.

85
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,420
I took the wrong turn.

86
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:19,870
Easy, Mr. Kirk. Let's get

87
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:19,870
this X-ray, and then you can

88
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:19,870
tell me all about it.

89
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:21,160
Clear!

90
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:26,370
Right-sided pneumothorax,

91
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,810
but there's air in the

92
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,810
mediastinum between the lungs.

93
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,810
That's strange.

94
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:32,680
Mr. Kirk, your right lung

95
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:32,680
has collapsed,

96
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:34,810
I'm gonna place a tube

97
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:34,810
to help it reinflate.

98
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:39,380
Okay, now what were you

99
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:39,380
saying before, something

100
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:39,380
about a wrong turn?

101
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:41,380
What did I say?

102
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:43,890
I think you were trying

103
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:43,890
to tell me how it happened.

104
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:43,890
The accident.

105
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,590
I was in a car accident?

106
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:47,220
Maybe you hit your head

107
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:47,220
in the process?

108
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:49,520
No?

109
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:53,460
Right after this, let's send

110
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:53,460
Mr. Kirk for a panscan.

111
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:55,760
I wanna make sure

112
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:55,760
nothing else is bothering him.

113
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,880
My heart's doing great, Mama.

114
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:02,540
Is that true, April?

115
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,140
We're on top of it.

116
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:07,550
We've established

117
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:07,550
a baseline echo, we have her

118
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:07,550
on continuous monitoring.

119
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:10,520
And because of COVID, we're

120
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:10,520
paying extra close attention.

121
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:15,180
I found an article

122
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:15,180
on the Internet about what

123
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:15,180
patients with cardiomyopathy

124
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:17,260
need to know

125
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:17,260
about the coronavirus.

126
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:18,820
I'll send it to the doctors.

127
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:19,920
You don't need to do that...

128
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:23,230
Go ahead, Alejandra.

129
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:23,230
No harm in sharing an article.

130
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:34,470
I should go.

131
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:34,470
My shift starts soon.

132
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:37,240
Mama, you said

133
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:37,240
you'd stop working

134
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:37,240
at the hotel.

135
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:39,840
I have to work, Yesenia.

136
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:46,950
Talk to you

137
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:46,950
later, Alejandra.

138
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:49,180
Okay.

139
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:53,390
She's so stubborn. I know

140
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:53,390
she takes off her mask

141
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:53,390
when it bothers her.

142
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,400
What if she gets sick?

143
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,560
Who'll take care of her

144
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,560
while I'm in here?

145
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:00,660
Hey.

146
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,800
Then we just have

147
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,800
to get you better,

148
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,800
so you can go home. Okay?

149
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:18,580
Hey. Come on.

150
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:18,580
Goodwin is making

151
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:18,580
an announcement.

152
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:25,280
As you all know, Dr. Lanik

153
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:25,280
has stepped down

154
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:25,280
as interim Chief of the ED.

155
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:28,420
And after

156
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:28,420
careful consideration,

157
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:32,560
the board and I

158
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:32,560
have come to a decision

159
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:32,560
on his replacement.

160
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:35,690
So, I am proud to announce

161
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:35,690
your new Chief

162
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,400
is Dr. Ethan Choi.

163
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:45,780
Nice work, yeah.

164
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:45,780
Congrats, man.

165
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,670
You okay?

166
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,710
Yeah.

167
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,530
Twenty-four-year-old female,

168
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:14,610
pregnant, complaining

169
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:14,610
of severe nausea and fatigue.

170
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:16,740
Started vomiting

171
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:16,740
this morning.

172
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:18,680
Records show

173
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:18,680
she's at 37 weeks.

174
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,370
Where'd they

175
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,370
bring her in from?

176
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,420
Cook County Jail.

177
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,540
Name's Aisha Barnes.

178
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,280
Okay. Thanks.

179
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:33,500
Hey. Uh, are those

180
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:33,500
cuffs necessary?

181
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:35,290
We can remove them

182
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:35,290
at your request.

183
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,490
But we prefer to keep them on

184
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,690
when dealing

185
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,690
with violent offenders.

186
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,620
Oh. Okay. Um...

187
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:42,560
I'll let

188
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:42,560
you know, then. Thanks.

189
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:47,770
Good morning, Aisha.

190
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:47,770
I'm Dr. Manning.

191
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:47,770
How are you feeling?

192
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:49,810
Like I'm gonna explode.

193
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:54,080
Thirty-seven weeks?

194
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:54,080
Not much longer, now.

195
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:55,570
So it says here, you started

196
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,810
feeling sick this morning?

197
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,440
It didn't start this morning.

198
00:05:58,550 --> 00:05:59,990
I've been feeling sick

199
00:05:58,550 --> 00:05:59,990
for over a week.

200
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,550
The nausea?

201
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:04,460
Yeah, and I get these

202
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:04,460
insane headaches,

203
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,860
like, on and off.

204
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,550
I kept telling them

205
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,550
in the infirmary,

206
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:08,690
but they wouldn't listen,

207
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,390
until I threw up

208
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,390
in the mess today.

209
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,390
Hmm.

210
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,490
BP 162/110.

211
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,590
Okay.

212
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,030
162/110 is a little higher

213
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,030
than we'd like to see.

214
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,440
Do you have any history

215
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,440
of hypertension?

216
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:22,340
I don't think so.

217
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:22,340
Doesn't it say in there?

218
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,700
Uh, no. No, it doesn't.

219
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,550
You're gonna get them

220
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,550
to take these cuffs off?

221
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,620
Um...

222
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,090
It's all right,

223
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,090
I can work around 'em.

224
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,850
Yeah. You know,

225
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,850
I heard them out there,

226
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,850
calling me a violent offender.

227
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,390
Just like the cop at my trial.

228
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,390
Told everybody I was

229
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,390
resisting arrest,

230
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,400
but all I did was push him

231
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,400
'cause he was harassing

232
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,400
my cousin.

233
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,760
And I served my time.

234
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:46,890
I'm sorry.

235
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,770
Let's warm up

236
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,770
the ultrasound.

237
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:51,970
The only reason

238
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:51,970
I'm back in jail is

239
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:51,970
'cause of a busted taillight.

240
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:55,370
Damn probation officer

241
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:55,370
called it a violation

242
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:55,370
of my parole.

243
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,610
I can't even get a court date,

244
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,610
so a judge can weigh in.

245
00:06:58,750 --> 00:06:59,840
I'm sorry to hear that.

246
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:02,450
Yeah, I can tell.

247
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:05,040
Uh...

248
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:08,390
Why don't we see

249
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:08,390
how your baby's doing, okay?

250
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:09,480
With your free hand, would you

251
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:09,480
mind lifting up your shirt

252
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:09,480
over your stomach for me?

253
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:12,860
lifting up your shirt

254
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:12,860
over your stomach?

255
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:14,860
You a licensed OB?

256
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:17,970
I specialize

257
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:17,970
in Emergency Medicine

258
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:17,970
and Pediatrics.

259
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:20,040
I wanna see someone

260
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:20,040
who knows what they're doing.

261
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,800
I am more than qualified

262
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,800
to perform a preliminary exam.

263
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:25,930
I wanna see

264
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:25,930
a licensed OB.

265
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:28,640
And you can't do anything else

266
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:28,640
until I see one.

267
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:36,950
Okay. Um, I will send

268
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:36,950
someone down from OB.

269
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:38,810
All right.

270
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:45,790
That's subdural air,

271
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:45,790
a pneumocephalus.

272
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:45,790
A what?

273
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:48,460
So, there's a pocket of air

274
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:48,460
trapped in the front

275
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,090
of your head, Mr. Kirk.

276
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,460
Is that bad?

277
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,460
Very.

278
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,800
For that much air,

279
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,800
it's just hard to believe

280
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:58,170
there's not any bruising

281
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:58,170
indicating blunt head trauma

282
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:58,170
from the car accident.

283
00:07:58,470 --> 00:07:59,870
It could be something else

284
00:07:58,470 --> 00:07:59,870
causing it.

285
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:02,580
Previous surgeries,

286
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:02,580
tumors, infections.

287
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,200
However the air got there,

288
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,200
we have to get it out.

289
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:05,780
Right. What's the best way?

290
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,870
Burr a hole in his head.

291
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,470
My head?

292
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,050
Anything less invasive?

293
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:13,080
I suppose we could

294
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:13,080
put it on hold for now.

295
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:16,110
Put him on high flow oxygen,

296
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:16,110
raise his bed 45 degrees,

297
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:17,920
see if venous

298
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:17,920
drainage helps.

299
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:20,120
Thanks, Sam.

300
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:22,020
Ah.

301
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:25,860
Here he comes. The new Chief.

302
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:25,860
Couldn't happen

303
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:25,860
to a nicer guy.

304
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:31,200
That's Sam.

305
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:33,840
But, seriously,

306
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:33,840
congratulations, man.

307
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:34,930
Well deserved.

308
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,870
Thanks, Will.

309
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,870
Appreciate that.

310
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:41,910
Hey, how's your case going?

311
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:45,020
A bit of a mystery,

312
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:45,020
but I'll crack it eventually.

313
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,140
Maybe I can help.

314
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:48,880
Um... Right now I'm good,

315
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:48,880
but thanks.

316
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:52,620
Actually, Will, as Chief,

317
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:52,620
I'd like to take a more

318
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:52,620
hands-on approach.

319
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:54,490
Help out where I can.

320
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:58,490
Great. I'm sending it

321
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:58,490
to you now.

322
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,590
Thanks.

323
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:05,130
So, Mr. Kirk crashed his car

324
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:05,130
into a lamp post.

325
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,270
He had a pneumothorax

326
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,270
I treated with a chest tube.

327
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:10,010
But the CT shows air

328
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:10,010
in his mediastinum

329
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:10,010
and his head.

330
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,550
He had a pneumothorax

331
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,550
from the crash.

332
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:13,910
Big blunt hit like that,

333
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:13,910
the air could go

334
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:13,910
all kinds of places.

335
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,040
Or maybe the air was there

336
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,040
before the car accident,

337
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:17,710
creating

338
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:17,710
intracranial pressure.

339
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,550
If the air wasn't there

340
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,550
from the crash,

341
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,550
then how'd it get there?

342
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:24,090
Jerome's medical records show

343
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:24,090
he had a cardiac ablation

344
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:25,660
in East Mercy

345
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:25,660
three weeks ago.

346
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,900
If the surgeon

347
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,900
was overzealous

348
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,900
with the RF probe,

349
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,190
he could have burned

350
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,190
a microscopic hole

351
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,190
in his esophagus

352
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,930
that's been leaking air

353
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,930
ever since.

354
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,760
Interesting theory.

355
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,770
I'm sending him

356
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,770
for an esophageal scope.

357
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:38,840
See if we can find the hole

358
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:38,840
before having surgery

359
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:38,840
scheduled to repair it.

360
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,910
Go for it.

361
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,910
Keep me posted?

362
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,830
Yeah.

363
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:43,930
Thanks.

364
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,710
Dr. Marcel.

365
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,710
Yeah?

366
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,730
Just the man

367
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,730
I was looking for.

368
00:09:58,630 --> 00:09:59,620
Oh.

369
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:03,100
This about that directive

370
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:03,100
from Goodwin?

371
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:03,100
The, uh, shrink session?

372
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:05,660
It's just a check-in.

373
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:05,660
You know,

374
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:06,960
see how you guys

375
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:06,960
are all doing,

376
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:08,160
given everything

377
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:08,160
that's going on.

378
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:09,260
Right.

379
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:12,900
Everybody in your department

380
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:12,900
I have on the books,

381
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:12,900
except for you.

382
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:14,000
If I didn't know any better,

383
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:15,100
I'd say you were trying

384
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:15,100
to avoid me.

385
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:17,010
Yeah, well,

386
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:17,010
that's 'cause I am.

387
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:18,840
Ha-ha.

388
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:18,840
Look, uh...

389
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:23,280
I appreciate the invite,

390
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:23,280
but I respectfully

391
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:23,280
RSVP "No."

392
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:24,950
Oh. So, you decline?

393
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:27,990
No offense, Daniel,

394
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:27,990
but talking about myself's

395
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:27,990
not really my thing.

396
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:30,750
Buddy, we can

397
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:30,750
talk about whatever you want.

398
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:33,260
Sports, movies. Look...

399
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,320
Thanksgiving's coming up.

400
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:38,160
I need a new stuffing recipe.

401
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:38,160
I'm serious.

402
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:42,730
You got some fantastic

403
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:42,730
ancient Cajun family recipe

404
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:42,730
you care to share with me?

405
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,300
How soon can I

406
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,300
get this over with?

407
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,710
Dr. Manning?

408
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,710
You needed a consult.

409
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:51,640
Ah! Are you

410
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:51,640
the new OBG-YN?

411
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:52,810
Angela Douglas.

412
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:52,810
Nice to meet you.

413
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:54,680
Nice to meet you. Thanks for

414
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:54,680
coming.

415
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,910
We've got

416
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,910
a young woman in

417
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,910
from Cook County Jail.

418
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:59,010
I didn't draw any labs

419
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:59,010
'cause she requested

420
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:59,010
a consult,

421
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,610
but I suspect

422
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,610
she's pre-eclamptic.

423
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,710
How's the baby doing?

424
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,320
She wouldn't

425
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,320
let me do an ultrasound,

426
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:06,190
but looks fine

427
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:06,190
on the fetal monitor.

428
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:08,020
Okay. I'll take a look.

429
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:08,020
Thanks.

430
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:10,290
Dr. Manning!

431
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:10,290
She's having a seizure!

432
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:15,030
Magnesium.

433
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:15,030
Ten grams IM.

434
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:17,300
Damn it! Why is this woman

435
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:17,300
still shackled?

436
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:19,030
I was told she was

437
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:19,030
a violent offender.

438
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:24,200
Officer! Start an IV.

439
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:24,200
I need a CBC, CMP,

440
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:24,200
uric acid, LDH,

441
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:26,750
and a magnesium drip

442
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:26,750
of two milligrams an hour.

443
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:27,840
You're right.

444
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:27,840
She's eclamptic.

445
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:28,970
I'm gonna have to

446
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:28,970
deliver this baby.

447
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,280
I'll take it from here.

448
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:32,050
Let me know

449
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:32,050
if there's anything

450
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:32,050
I can do to help.

451
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:34,050
Transport! Hurry!

452
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,250
Yesenia, talk to me.

453
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,250
Too hard to breathe?

454
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,200
Dr. Stanton, I need you.

455
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:51,970
What's going on, April?

456
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:53,270
Yesenia's working

457
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:53,270
too hard to breathe.

458
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:55,310
We should intubate her now,

459
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:55,310
before it's too late.

460
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:57,370
She's not hypoxic.

461
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,010
Her arterial blood gas

462
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,010
pH is normal.

463
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:01,380
So is her pCO2

464
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:01,380
and her SaO2.

465
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,680
No, she's using

466
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,680
accessory muscles

467
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,680
to breathe.

468
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:05,450
She's gonna tire out.

469
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:05,450
I've seen this before.

470
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:09,190
No. The numbers

471
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:09,190
don't support intubating her

472
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:09,190
at this time. Sorry.

473
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:11,120
Go get another doctor.

474
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:13,920
Excuse me?

475
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:15,260
Get another doctor

476
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:15,260
who's willing

477
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,830
to give Yesenia

478
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,830
the treatment she needs.

479
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,860
You can't talk

480
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,860
to me like that.

481
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,860
I know what I'm doing.

482
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:21,960
No, you don't.

483
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:25,830
I swear to God,

484
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:25,830
you get another doctor,

485
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:27,270
or I will come out there

486
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:27,270
and get one myself.

487
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:33,140
Help me suit up.

488
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:33,140
Yes, Doctor.

489
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,770
Don't think this is over.

490
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:50,460
I've been cooking for myself

491
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:50,460
every meal for about a month.

492
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:54,000
And all of a sudden,

493
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:54,000
it dawns on me,

494
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:54,000
I'm a terrible cook.

495
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:58,370
It relaxes me, though.

496
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:58,370
I sleep better.

497
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:58,370
You sleeping okay?

498
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,100
Oh, man. Like a baby.

499
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,770
Good.

500
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,100
Yeah.

501
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:06,410
Does that mean

502
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:06,410
we're done here?

503
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,870
You really don't like talking

504
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,870
about yourself, do you?

505
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:11,820
I mean, come on. Do you?

506
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,190
I don't know.

507
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,190
In certain circumstances,

508
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,190
yeah.

509
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:17,490
I guess I consider myself

510
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:17,490
more of a stoic.

511
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:18,850
Interesting.

512
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:20,790
Big on hiding emotion.

513
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:24,890
Never let 'em see you sweat,

514
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:24,890
no matter how much pain

515
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:24,890
and suffering you're in.

516
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:26,120
That you?

517
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:27,220
Nope.

518
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,360
No, I didn't think so.

519
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:31,770
But, uh, you did just

520
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:31,770
describe yourself that way.

521
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:34,210
You're reading way too much

522
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:34,210
into a simple word.

523
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:37,010
I meant it

524
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:37,010
more like, uh, laconic.

525
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,840
You sure you don't

526
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,840
need to get that?

527
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,510
I'm sorry.

528
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,510
It's my daughter.

529
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:45,880
She's saying

530
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:45,880
it's an emergency.

531
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:47,050
You mind if we cut this

532
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:47,050
a little short?

533
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,780
Oh, man. Long as

534
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,780
it satisfies Goodwin.

535
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:54,820
Just remember, you ever

536
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:54,820
need to talk to anybody,

537
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:54,820
about anything, I'm here.

538
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:56,520
Thank you, man.

539
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,100
So, Ethan's the new chief.

540
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:08,800
Yep.

541
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:10,000
Hey, I feel for him.

542
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:12,050
All that administrative work,

543
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:12,050
who wants the headache?

544
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:16,410
You must be disappointed.

545
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:19,050
Would've been nice

546
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:19,050
to have been asked.

547
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:22,490
But it's all good.

548
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:22,490
Ethan will do great.

549
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,220
Big of you, Will.

550
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:26,390
Because if I were

551
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:26,390
in your shoes,

552
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:27,960
guy comes in

553
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:27,960
underneath me,

554
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:30,090
then leapfrogs me

555
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:30,090
to be my boss,

556
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:31,990
I'd wanna kill somebody.

557
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,160
Any word on Jerome Kirk's

558
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,160
scope results?

559
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:38,460
Not yet.

560
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:41,510
But Ethan's been

561
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:41,510
asking, too.

562
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,950
You let me know

563
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,950
as soon as they get in.

564
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:50,140
Dr. Virani.

565
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:50,140
Good to see you.

566
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:52,610
Thanks again

567
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:52,610
for that offer.

568
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:54,850
I'm sorry you didn't

569
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:54,850
take it, Dr. Halstead.

570
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,390
How's the

571
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,390
clinical trial going?

572
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:57,480
Fine.

573
00:14:57,590 --> 00:15:00,590
I'm about to meet a colleague

574
00:14:57,590 --> 00:15:00,590
of yours, Dr. Lyall.

575
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:01,890
To be Co-PI?

576
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,290
He came

577
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,290
highly recommended,

578
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,130
and we had a good talk

579
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,130
over the phone.

580
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:09,100
Did a med school rotation

581
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:09,100
in cardiology,

582
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,170
so he's an excellent candidate

583
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,170
to study a heart failure

584
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,170
medication.

585
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:14,100
Yeah. Ted's a good doctor.

586
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:14,100
Smart.

587
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,410
Hey, Will.

588
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,410
Uh, excuse me.

589
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:22,410
I just talked to GI.

590
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:22,410
Mr. Kirk's esophageal

591
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:22,410
scope was negative.

592
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,610
I forwarded it

593
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,610
to you.

594
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:27,650
Hmm. I see.

595
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,580
The hole could be

596
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,580
more proximal,

597
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:33,020
higher up

598
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:33,020
on the esophagus.

599
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:34,490
That's where the scope

600
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:34,490
would miss it.

601
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,330
We need to do

602
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,330
a contrast study.

603
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:39,090
A heart ablation

604
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:39,090
accidentally burned

605
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:39,090
a hole in the esophagus?

606
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,190
It's kind of a stretch.

607
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,370
He came in

608
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,370
with a collapsed lung.

609
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:44,460
If there is a hole,

610
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:44,460
it's gotta be related

611
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:44,460
to that.

612
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:48,440
I say send him

613
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:48,440
for a bronchoscopy.

614
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:48,440
Why overthink it?

615
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:56,220
Where is she, honey?

616
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:56,220
She's in here.

617
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:58,610
Daniel?

618
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:01,150
Oh, for God's sakes,

619
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:01,150
Anna, really?

620
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,950
Mom, you've been in pain

621
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,950
since last night.

622
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,950
You need a doctor.

623
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:06,250
You should have asked me

624
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:06,250
before you called him.

625
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,450
You'd have said no.

626
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,450
I can't believe this.

627
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,960
You did the right

628
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,960
thing, sweetie.

629
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:11,120
Daniel, no.

630
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:12,500
So, it's your stomach?

631
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,090
I'm just constipated.

632
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,570
Mom, it's not just that.

633
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:19,200
Honey, I told you if I didn't

634
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:19,200
feel better tomorrow,

635
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:19,200
I'd go to the doctor.

636
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:20,570
Well. look, I'm here, now.

637
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,230
Why don't you just let me

638
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,230
take a quick look?

639
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:24,210
No.

640
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:24,210
Mom! Seriously?

641
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:25,300
Maybe we should go

642
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:25,300
to the hospital.

643
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:27,420
Come on. We can be in Med

644
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:27,420
in 10 minutes.

645
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:27,420
Guys, look.

646
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,540
I've been managing it fine

647
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,540
with Ibuprofen.

648
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:31,410
It doesn't really

649
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:31,410
seem that way.

650
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,950
You are both making

651
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,950
way too much out of this.

652
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:36,350
Ooh.

653
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,030
Oh, I'm gonna

654
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,030
be sick.

655
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:45,630
Mom, you're scaring me.

656
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:45,630
Can we please just do

657
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:45,630
what Dad said?

658
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:48,500
Okay. Go get

659
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:48,500
your Mom's coat. Honey?

660
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:52,070
Honey, we'll take you

661
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:52,070
to the hospital.

662
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:52,070
Get you fixed up, okay?

663
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:53,530
Okay.

664
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,000
Stanton's a resident, April.

665
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,000
You have to respect that.

666
00:16:57,110 --> 00:17:00,600
Yesenia was falling apart.

667
00:16:57,110 --> 00:17:00,600
I've watched it

668
00:16:57,110 --> 00:17:00,600
countless times.

669
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,380
COVID comes on so fast,

670
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,380
we can't get ahead of it.

671
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,110
I understand.

672
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,110
But you set him off.

673
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:08,050
Now he's saying

674
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:08,050
he won't work

675
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:08,050
with you anymore.

676
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,710
Good. He shouldn't be

677
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,710
in here anyway.

678
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,290
Get him out

679
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,290
of the COVID wing.

680
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:13,380
Okay.

681
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:15,700
I'll move him

682
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:15,700
somewhere else.

683
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:17,420
Thank you, Ethan.

684
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:19,660
But no more chewing out

685
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:19,660
the residents.

686
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:22,570
I know your heart's

687
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:22,570
in this COVID battle,

688
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:22,570
but you can't go in alone.

689
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,130
Understood.

690
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:27,560
Have to admit,

691
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:30,440
it's nice having you

692
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:30,440
as the Chief.

693
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:34,450
Funny enough, I was gonna

694
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:34,450
ask you to keep me in line.

695
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:35,710
You know I can be

696
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:35,710
a bit of a...

697
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:38,020
Hard-ass?

698
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:41,190
I was thinking more along

699
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:41,190
the line of perfectionist.

700
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:42,590
But, yeah, I guess

701
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:42,590
that's what I meant.

702
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:44,660
I'll speak up if need be.

703
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:47,460
You've made that clear.

704
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:54,760
Hi. Looks like

705
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:54,760
everything went well.

706
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:59,440
Yeah. Mom gorked out a little

707
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:59,440
on the Valium we gave her

708
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:59,440
for the seizures,

709
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:02,510
but other than that,

710
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:02,510
no complications.

711
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:02,510
Good.

712
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:05,440
Aisha delivered a beautiful

713
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:05,440
and healthy baby girl.

714
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,180
Is this your first?

715
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,610
She is.

716
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,610
Mine, too.

717
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:12,150
You picked out

718
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:12,150
a name yet?

719
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:13,580
Mmm-mmm.

720
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:15,620
You got plenty of time

721
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:15,620
to think about it.

722
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:19,750
About 24 more hours

723
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:19,750
of magnesium to prevent

724
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:19,750
any more seizures,

725
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:21,790
and you should have

726
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:21,790
a speedy recovery.

727
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:25,060
Aisha?

728
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:27,420
What's the matter?

729
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:31,740
When they send me back,

730
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:31,740
they're gonna take her

731
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:31,740
away from me.

732
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,680
Look, you still have

733
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,680
a couple more days

734
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:38,080
while you recover

735
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:38,080
from the cesarean.

736
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,570
Okay?

737
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,150
Wait. You really need to put

738
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,150
those shackles back on her?

739
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,310
Uh, standard protocol.

740
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,420
She just had

741
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,420
emergency surgery.

742
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:53,190
Don't tell us

743
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:53,190
how to do our jobs.

744
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:55,290
She's still

745
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:55,290
breastfeeding in there.

746
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,460
If that baby ends up

747
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,460
malnourished because you were

748
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,460
just following protocol,

749
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:00,870
you might not have a job

750
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:00,870
to worry about any longer.

751
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,140
We can wait

752
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,140
until she's done.

753
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:05,600
Thank you.

754
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:13,770
All these protocols

755
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:13,770
and not one of them

756
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,680
prioritizes the health

757
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,680
of the people in their care.

758
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:19,120
Aisha said her complaints

759
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:19,120
were ignored back at the jail.

760
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:22,190
Oh, I don't doubt it.

761
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:22,190
And now, she has a baby

762
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:22,190
they can't accommodate.

763
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:25,190
I assume Family Services

764
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:25,190
will care for the baby

765
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:25,190
until she's released?

766
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:29,630
Sure. But Aisha and the baby

767
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:29,630
will miss out on weeks,

768
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:29,630
maybe months, of bonding.

769
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:30,750
Yeah.

770
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:33,600
All this in the name

771
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:33,600
of public safety.

772
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:36,540
Yeah, right.

773
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:36,540
I've been down

774
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:36,540
this road before.

775
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,900
I have another call

776
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,900
with the ACLU next week.

777
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:41,400
What more

778
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:41,400
can be done for Aisha?

779
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,880
Outside of dismantling

780
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,880
the entire penal system?

781
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:54,550
Mr. Kirk's bronchoscopy

782
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:54,550
results just came in.

783
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:55,780
Send them to me.

784
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:55,780
Uh-huh.

785
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:59,860
No hole in his airway.

786
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:59,860
I knew it.

787
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:03,700
Send him up to IR right now

788
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:03,700
for a contrast study

789
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:03,700
of his esophagus.

790
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,890
Mmm-hmm.

791
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:10,840
No. Mr. Kirk?

792
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:10,840
Can you hear me?

793
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:13,870
He's unresponsive.

794
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,870
Sats down in the 60s.

795
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:20,680
Heart rate's dropping,

796
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:20,680
too, 54, 48, 42.

797
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:24,380
We're intubating.

798
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:24,380
Twenty of etomidate,

799
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:24,380
100 of sux. Damn it.

800
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:34,890
I'm in. Bag him.

801
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:37,360
It's the pneumocephalus.

802
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:39,200
We have to get that air

803
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:39,200
out of his head.

804
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:40,320
Get Abrams down here now.

805
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:41,600
Should I call Ethan, too?

806
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,960
Ethan's not his doctor! I am!

807
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:17,460
What's this?

808
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:19,400
The air in his head

809
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:19,400
was compressing his brain,

810
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:22,480
causing him to rapidly

811
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:22,480
deteriorate. It needed

812
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:22,480
immediate evacuation.

813
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:23,980
By sticking

814
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:23,980
a needle in his eye?

815
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:25,640
Easy access.

816
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:28,540
He was already sedated,

817
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:28,540
and we would've wasted time

818
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:28,540
moving to the OR.

819
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:34,780
All right.

820
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:34,780
I'm almost done.

821
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:36,690
But I'm just treating

822
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:36,690
a symptom here.

823
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:38,860
If you don't figure out

824
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:38,860
where that air is coming from,

825
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,950
next time, I'm gonna have to

826
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,950
burr that hole in his skull.

827
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,560
That won't be

828
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,560
an issue.

829
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,730
He's going straight upstairs

830
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,730
for a CT surgeon

831
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:46,930
to locate

832
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:46,930
and plug directly.

833
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:50,690
You good?

834
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:55,670
Can I talk to you?

835
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:55,670
Yeah.

836
00:21:57,610 --> 00:22:00,270
Just wait for the surgeons

837
00:21:57,610 --> 00:22:00,270
to figure it out?

838
00:21:57,610 --> 00:22:00,270
That's the plan?

839
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:03,850
Will, you said so yourself,

840
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:03,850
he was always gonna

841
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:03,850
need surgery to fix this.

842
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:06,320
Yeah, but if you'd let me

843
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:06,320
do my job, we might know

844
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:06,320
where the problem is.

845
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:08,380
You never let me finish

846
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:08,380
working up the esophagus.

847
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:10,860
I'm sorry,

848
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:10,860
but he's too sick now.

849
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:10,860
There's no time.

850
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:13,390
But there was time

851
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:13,390
for your bronchoscopy?

852
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:14,480
He came in

853
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:14,480
with lung trauma.

854
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:16,490
It felt necessary

855
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:16,490
to scope his airway

856
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,360
instead of going on

857
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,360
a wild goose chase

858
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,360
through the esophagus.

859
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,590
What's this

860
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,590
really about, man?

861
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,670
You meddling with

862
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,670
my patient's treatment.

863
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,670
You sure?

864
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,560
It's not about the fact

865
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,560
that I made Chief over you?

866
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:28,840
Oh, please. The only thing

867
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:28,840
that matters to me right now,

868
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:31,040
is Mr. Kirk's well-being.

869
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:31,040
Then, you agree.

870
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:34,770
The only option right now,

871
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:34,770
is to send him to surgery

872
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:34,770
so he doesn't die.

873
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:41,950
Dad, what are

874
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:41,950
they doing?

875
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:45,790
Sweetie, we gotta

876
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:45,790
try and give Mom her privacy

877
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:45,790
right now, okay?

878
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:48,590
Yeah. But what's

879
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:48,590
that long tube thing

880
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:48,590
they're getting?

881
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,960
It's called an endoscope.

882
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:53,900
And they are gonna use it

883
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:53,900
to find out what's going on

884
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:53,900
in your mom's tummy.

885
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:55,430
Dad, can we

886
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:55,430
go in, please?

887
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:58,770
Sweetie, I'm pretty sure

888
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:58,770
that she doesn't wanna

889
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:58,770
see me right now.

890
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:02,600
Dad, I am freaking out

891
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:02,600
right now, okay?

892
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:02,600
Can we please go in?

893
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:07,850
Dr. Marcel?

894
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:07,850
Yeah.

895
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:11,610
I don't know if they told you,

896
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:11,610
but the patient is my ex-wife.

897
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,920
Yeah.

898
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,920
And this is

899
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,920
our daughter, Anna.

900
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:15,010
Hi, Anna.

901
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:18,060
So, you guys doing

902
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:18,060
a little endoscopy, huh?

903
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,460
Yeah. The X-rays

904
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,460
weren't conclusive,

905
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,760
so, we're trying

906
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,760
to figure out

907
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,760
what's going on.

908
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,860
What are you

909
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,860
doing here, Daniel?

910
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:26,400
He cares

911
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:26,400
about you, Mom.

912
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:27,760
That's a change.

913
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,130
Mom!

914
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,530
It's okay, sweetie. It's just

915
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,530
the anesthesia talking.

916
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,870
Um, why don't we

917
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,870
let them do their thing?

918
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:36,530
Thank you, Crockett,

919
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:36,530
we'll leave you to it.

920
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,630
Sure thing.

921
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:39,540
I...

922
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:43,440
Dad, how long

923
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:43,440
is this gonna take?

924
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:45,820
Well, that depends on

925
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:45,820
what Dr. Marcel finds.

926
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:48,120
Well, it could be

927
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:48,120
really serious,

928
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:48,120
don't you think?

929
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:50,620
You know what, honey,

930
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:50,620
I think it's gonna be okay.

931
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:53,020
Let's get

932
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:53,020
a little lunch.

933
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:53,020
Come on.

934
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:55,900
Mi cielito needs a machine

935
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:55,900
to breathe?

936
00:23:57,530 --> 00:23:58,930
This can't be happening.

937
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:01,590
Her lungs aren't

938
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:01,590
working properly, Alejandra.

939
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:04,130
She's in

940
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:04,130
respiratory failure.

941
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,910
But I assure you, this is

942
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,910
the best option for now.

943
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:24,850
My baby.

944
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:34,930
Please, April.

945
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:36,870
Please help me.

946
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:42,980
Aisha's broken taillight

947
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:42,980
was deemed a violation

948
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:42,980
of her parole.

949
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:45,770
I don't get how

950
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:45,770
a probation officer

951
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:48,710
can have that much control

952
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:48,710
over whether or not

953
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:48,710
she gets to see her baby.

954
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,750
Maybe someone

955
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,750
can talk to him?

956
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:53,690
Well, you could try,

957
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:53,690
but it won't do any good.

958
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:56,150
Her fate is in the hands

959
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:56,150
of the court now.

960
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:59,590
Her court date

961
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:59,590
keeps getting pushed

962
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:59,590
because of COVID.

963
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:02,050
There is an argument

964
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:02,050
to be made here,

965
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:05,100
about trying to get Aisha

966
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:05,100
a compassionate release.

967
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:09,030
Compassion's not really

968
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:09,030
the name of the game

969
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:09,030
in the justice system.

970
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:12,130
Cops are promoted

971
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:12,130
for the number

972
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:12,130
of arrests they make.

973
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,510
Prosecutors for the number

974
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,510
of defendants they convict.

975
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:20,610
Look, I'm not sure anyone

976
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:20,610
will listen, but let me

977
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:20,610
make a couple of phone calls.

978
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:25,140
Come in.

979
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:28,750
Hi. So, she has an ulcer.

980
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,880
I'm waiting for the biopsy

981
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,880
to detect H. pylori,

982
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:33,930
but I suspect the cause

983
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:33,930
might be an overuse

984
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:33,930
of NSAIDs.

985
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:35,260
Yeah. She did mention

986
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:35,260
she'd been taking them.

987
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,690
Yeah, it's perforated

988
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,690
her duodenal wall.

989
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,770
I'm gonna have

990
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,770
to take her up

991
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,770
for an emergency lap.

992
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:41,600
I'm sorry.

993
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:41,600
What does that mean?

994
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,190
Mom just needs

995
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,190
a little surgery, honey.

996
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:44,760
Surgery? Oh, my God.

997
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:47,840
I've done this

998
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:47,840
hundreds of times.

999
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:47,840
Your mom'll be sore,

1000
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:49,640
but before long,

1001
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:49,640
she'll be as good as new.

1002
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:51,510
How long a convalescence?

1003
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:54,610
Uh, she shouldn't stray

1004
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:54,610
too far from home

1005
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:54,610
for about eight weeks.

1006
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,820
Okay. Thank you, buddy.

1007
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,820
Mmm-hmm.

1008
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,710
Gonna be fine. Right?

1009
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,710
She'll be fine.

1010
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:07,050
Hey.

1011
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:10,120
Did you check your iPad?

1012
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:10,120
I sent you

1013
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:10,120
Yesenia Cruz's chart.

1014
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:14,060
She's still

1015
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:14,060
on the vent, but I don't think

1016
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:14,060
she's gonna make it.

1017
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,090
Sorry to hear that.

1018
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:19,600
She's really close

1019
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:19,600
with her mom.

1020
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:19,600
It's just the two of them.

1021
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:22,130
We should allow

1022
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:22,130
her mom in here

1023
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:22,130
to sit vigil.

1024
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:24,570
You know there are

1025
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:24,570
strict protocols in place.

1026
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:28,710
Yes. And the only two reasons

1027
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:28,710
that we would make

1028
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:28,710
an exception to them ever,

1029
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:31,810
are if the patient is a minor

1030
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:31,810
or facing imminent death.

1031
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,010
Yesenia is both.

1032
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:36,580
Let her mom have

1033
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:36,580
this one last moment.

1034
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:40,160
April, she's testing positive

1035
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:40,160
for COVID as recently

1036
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:40,160
as this morning.

1037
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:41,320
That negates everything.

1038
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:43,560
Ethan, she needs

1039
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:43,560
her mom.

1040
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:47,230
I'm sorry. I really am.

1041
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:47,230
But if the mother's exposed...

1042
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:48,560
It's a risk

1043
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:48,560
she's willing to take.

1044
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:50,160
That's not a decision

1045
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:50,160
she's allowed to make.

1046
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:52,000
Ethan...

1047
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:52,000
I'm sorry.

1048
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,700
You wanted to know

1049
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,700
when you're being

1050
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,700
a hard-ass?

1051
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:02,610
This is it.

1052
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:18,660
ASA Lake, we want

1053
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:18,660
to thank you for taking

1054
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:18,660
the time to talk to us.

1055
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:19,820
Not a problem.

1056
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:22,330
I'm on call to

1057
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:22,330
the State's Attorney's office

1058
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:22,330
this week anyway,

1059
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,940
and my boss asked me

1060
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,940
to look into this directly.

1061
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:26,900
It's about

1062
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:26,900
Aisha Barnes.

1063
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:28,770
She was transferred

1064
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:28,770
from Cook County today.

1065
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,740
Dr. Douglas

1066
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,740
delivered her baby.

1067
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:33,140
I'm familiar with

1068
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:33,140
Miss Barnes' situation.

1069
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,750
She had a girl,

1070
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,750
by the way.

1071
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:40,880
So, you're aware that

1072
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:40,880
Miss Barnes is in jail

1073
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:40,880
on a parole violation?

1074
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:41,980
I am.

1075
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,350
We understand

1076
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,350
how much the pandemic

1077
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:47,150
must be clogging up

1078
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:47,150
the legal docket,

1079
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:51,360
so, I'm sure her case

1080
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:51,360
is just an oversight,

1081
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:55,930
but in looking

1082
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:55,930
at House Bill 1464,

1083
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:59,340
it seems like Miss Barnes

1084
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:59,340
is a good candidate

1085
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,930
to be offered

1086
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,930
a compassionate release.

1087
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,810
That amendment

1088
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,810
to the criminal code

1089
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:05,380
only applies

1090
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:05,380
to nonviolent offenders.

1091
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,880
Miss Barnes was

1092
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,880
convicted of assault.

1093
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:09,280
She put her hands

1094
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:09,280
on a peace officer.

1095
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:11,940
It's our understanding

1096
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:11,940
that she was defending

1097
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:11,940
her cousin,

1098
00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:14,680
and all she did

1099
00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:14,680
was push an officer.

1100
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:16,090
That's not how

1101
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:16,090
the cop described it.

1102
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:18,420
Oh, and the cops

1103
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:18,420
never lie, right?

1104
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:22,030
Dr. Douglas,

1105
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:22,030
she was convicted by a jury.

1106
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:26,060
Sir, we're not asking

1107
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:26,060
to re-litigate the past.

1108
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:28,190
We're simply asking

1109
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:28,190
for your assistance

1110
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:31,330
in getting her hearing

1111
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:31,330
moved up on the docket.

1112
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:34,310
Listen, I know the most

1113
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:34,310
politic answer

1114
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:34,310
I can give you,

1115
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:36,240
is that I'll promise

1116
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:36,240
to look into it.

1117
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:38,970
But the reality is,

1118
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:38,970
we've got somewhere

1119
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:38,970
north of a thousand cases

1120
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:41,950
waiting to clear

1121
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:41,950
because of this

1122
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:41,950
COVID bottleneck,

1123
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:45,080
and pretty much every one

1124
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:45,080
of them takes preference

1125
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:45,080
to this.

1126
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:47,420
I'm sorry, that's just

1127
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:47,420
where we are.

1128
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:04,030
How's it going in there?

1129
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:06,900
We found the hole.

1130
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:06,900
Repairing it now.

1131
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,100
In case you're wondering,

1132
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,100
it was in the esophagus.

1133
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:13,270
I guess it wasn't

1134
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:13,270
a wild goose chase

1135
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:13,270
after all.

1136
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:17,220
You were right, Will.

1137
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:17,220
Good job.

1138
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:22,710
Look, I hope you understand,

1139
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:22,710
I feel I have to make

1140
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:22,710
some changes around here.

1141
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:24,990
Last week, when Miss Goodwin

1142
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:24,990
and I discussed my new role...

1143
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:26,080
Last week?

1144
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:27,420
Yeah. And we both agreed,

1145
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:30,500
the ED has not been running

1146
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:30,500
as effectively as it could be.

1147
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,430
I think that's

1148
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,430
because of a lack

1149
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,430
of leadership.

1150
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:34,360
And I believe a good leader

1151
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:34,360
takes responsibility

1152
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:36,200
for everything

1153
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:36,200
that happens on his watch.

1154
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,290
That's true.

1155
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,460
A good leader also doesn't

1156
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,460
micro-manage.

1157
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:42,330
A good leader trusts

1158
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:42,330
that those under him

1159
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:42,330
know what they're doing.

1160
00:29:46,010 --> 00:29:47,450
Maybe even more

1161
00:29:46,010 --> 00:29:47,450
than he does.

1162
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:00,020
Your turn, honey.

1163
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:01,120
Mmm?

1164
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:07,330
You could

1165
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:07,330
come over next week

1166
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:07,330
and cook dinner for us.

1167
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,360
Mom has always

1168
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,360
loved your lasagna.

1169
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,770
Why don't we, uh,

1170
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,770
wait and see

1171
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,770
how Mom feels?

1172
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:21,010
She doesn't act like it,

1173
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:21,010
but she actually really

1174
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:21,010
needs you, Dad.

1175
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:23,270
Sweetie,

1176
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:23,270
Mom is gonna be fine.

1177
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:24,870
I really don't

1178
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:24,870
want you to worry.

1179
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:26,880
Don't you wanna

1180
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:26,880
be there for her?

1181
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:31,420
I'm just a phone call away.

1182
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:31,420
If Mom needs me, she'll call.

1183
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,430
Dad, she's moving us

1184
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,430
to Arizona.

1185
00:30:37,530 --> 00:30:38,520
What?

1186
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:39,820
Yeah.

1187
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:43,430
Move?

1188
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:43,430
Why? What...

1189
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:43,430
Did she say why?

1190
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:46,130
She was

1191
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:46,130
acting weird one day,

1192
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,330
so I got into

1193
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,330
her computer and...

1194
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:51,310
You broke

1195
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:51,310
into her computer?

1196
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:51,310
No, no, no. I know.

1197
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:54,040
But I found

1198
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:54,040
all of these emails

1199
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:57,310
from this realtor in Phoenix,

1200
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:57,310
and he's been

1201
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:57,310
sending her listings.

1202
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:59,150
Dad, I don't wanna

1203
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:59,150
go to Phoenix!

1204
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:00,380
Okay, sweetie. Look.

1205
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:04,220
It hasn't happened yet.

1206
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:04,220
We're gonna

1207
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:04,220
figure it out. Okay?

1208
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,150
Walkie.

1209
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:11,920
Hey, April?

1210
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,840
You still think

1211
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,840
it's a good idea

1212
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,840
to bring in the mother?

1213
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:26,270
Yeah, I do.

1214
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:28,950
All right,

1215
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:28,950
tell her it's okay.

1216
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,950
Really?

1217
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,950
As long as she's

1218
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,950
dressed in full PPE.

1219
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:35,320
I'll make sure of it.

1220
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:35,320
I promise.

1221
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:44,490
Hang in there, okay?

1222
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:44,490
We'll get your mom.

1223
00:31:48,170 --> 00:31:49,300
Pick up.

1224
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,870
Hey, Mama.

1225
00:31:58,310 --> 00:31:59,340
Hey, Mama.

1226
00:31:58,310 --> 00:31:59,340
Hey.

1227
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:00,440
How are

1228
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:00,440
you two doing?

1229
00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:03,340
I decided

1230
00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:03,340
on a name. Nuru.

1231
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:05,450
Aw.

1232
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:05,450
It means

1233
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:05,450
"born in daylight."

1234
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:06,980
Isn't that pretty?

1235
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:08,450
Yeah, it is.

1236
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:11,250
Yeah, that's your name.

1237
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:11,250
Nuru...

1238
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,350
My Nuru...

1239
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:19,000
We're gonna have to

1240
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:19,000
return this child back

1241
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:19,000
to the nursery temporarily.

1242
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:20,090
Why?

1243
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:21,430
My partner just

1244
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:21,430
ended his shift,

1245
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:24,060
so I'm on my own

1246
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:24,060
until I can get

1247
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:24,060
a replacement to sub in.

1248
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:25,490
So?

1249
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,300
So, when there's

1250
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,300
just one of us,

1251
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:31,040
protocol dictates that

1252
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:31,040
the inmate remain shackled

1253
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:31,040
at all times.

1254
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:38,580
Okay, cuff me

1255
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:38,580
if you have to,

1256
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:38,580
but leave my baby.

1257
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:43,180
It also states

1258
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:43,180
that there are

1259
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:43,180
no visitors allowed.

1260
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:46,260
Are you kidding?

1261
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:46,260
You don't have to do this.

1262
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,490
I'm just following orders.

1263
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,930
Do it.

1264
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:52,290
No!

1265
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:54,660
Dr. Manning?

1266
00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:55,960
Wait outside.

1267
00:32:58,570 --> 00:33:00,440
I really don't want

1268
00:32:58,570 --> 00:33:00,440
to have to do this

1269
00:32:58,570 --> 00:33:00,440
myself, ma'am.

1270
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:01,700
Then, don't.

1271
00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:03,100
I'm gonna need you

1272
00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:03,100
to step out of the way.

1273
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:05,270
This baby is not

1274
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:05,270
going anywhere.

1275
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:06,640
I don't have time for this.

1276
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:07,940
No.

1277
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:14,280
Natalie?

1278
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:27,160
The thing is,

1279
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:27,160
we're done, right?

1280
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:28,570
Okay? It's not

1281
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:28,570
gonna happen again.

1282
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:31,160
And I appreciate you guys

1283
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:31,160
understanding this. We good?

1284
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:32,500
Yeah.

1285
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:32,500
Thank you.

1286
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:33,600
You got it.

1287
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:45,510
I always say, negotiations

1288
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:45,510
are like temperature checks,

1289
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:45,510
cooler heads prevail.

1290
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:48,020
Sorry, Dr. Manning.

1291
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:48,020
It's okay, Earl.

1292
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,450
They're not

1293
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,450
pressing charges?

1294
00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:52,020
I didn't have to do

1295
00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:52,020
much saber-rattling.

1296
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:55,250
Sheriff's department

1297
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:55,250
really didn't want

1298
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:55,250
to make this an issue.

1299
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,520
Let's not do this

1300
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,520
again, okay, killer?

1301
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:07,570
You okay?

1302
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:08,660
Seems so.

1303
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:13,540
I convinced

1304
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:13,540
a lawyer at the ACLU

1305
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:13,540
to look into Aisha's case.

1306
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,070
That's great news.

1307
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:17,580
Yeah. That's what

1308
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:17,580
I was coming to tell you

1309
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,620
before you went Wonder Woman

1310
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,620
on that guard.

1311
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:24,720
We both

1312
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:24,720
assault an officer.

1313
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:28,350
She gets separated

1314
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:28,350
from her baby, I get

1315
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:28,350
a slap on the wrist.

1316
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,230
I wonder

1317
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,230
what the difference is.

1318
00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:34,100
You think it would've

1319
00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:34,100
been different

1320
00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:34,100
if you pushed him?

1321
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,100
I don't know.

1322
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,100
I'm a doctor.

1323
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,360
I may get some leeway.

1324
00:34:38,470 --> 00:34:40,770
Maybe I'll do the shoving

1325
00:34:38,470 --> 00:34:40,770
next time and we'll see.

1326
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:46,410
Hopefully, someday,

1327
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:46,410
our kids won't have

1328
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:46,410
to deal with this.

1329
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:48,770
Yeah. Well...

1330
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:52,520
We're nothing

1331
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:52,520
without hope.

1332
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:00,060
April, help me

1333
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:00,060
with this intake.

1334
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:09,460
Alejandra Cruz, 50 years old,

1335
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:09,460
collapsed at the hotel

1336
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:09,460
where she works.

1337
00:35:09,570 --> 00:35:11,730
Just tested positive

1338
00:35:09,570 --> 00:35:11,730
for COVID upon arrival.

1339
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:13,800
April.

1340
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,840
Maybe I wasn't

1341
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,840
so careful after all.

1342
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:21,340
Easy, Alejandra.

1343
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:21,340
Save your energy, okay?

1344
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,810
Please don't tell Yesenia.

1345
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,310
I don't want her to worry.

1346
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:36,850
Yes. How can I help you,

1347
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:36,850
Dr. Halstead?

1348
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:41,100
Would you be willing to talk

1349
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:41,100
about how you and the board

1350
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:41,100
decided on Ethan as Chief?

1351
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,760
Uh...

1352
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:45,300
Sure.

1353
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:48,200
As we went through

1354
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:48,200
our list of names,

1355
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:53,610
the one thing we kept

1356
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:53,610
coming back to was Dr. Choi's

1357
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:53,610
military experience.

1358
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:58,880
His familiarity with that sort

1359
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:58,880
of structured system,

1360
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:02,750
especially when you're filling

1361
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:02,750
a managerial position,

1362
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,650
we thought it put him

1363
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,650
over the top.

1364
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:05,750
Makes total sense.

1365
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:09,260
But as a doctor,

1366
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:09,260
all due respect, Miss Goodwin,

1367
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:12,200
I have more experience,

1368
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:12,200
I'm a better diagnostician.

1369
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:15,700
You have a real talent,

1370
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:15,700
Dr. Halstead. No question.

1371
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,740
Wish I would've been

1372
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,740
considered more seriously.

1373
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:20,770
I've been here longer

1374
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:20,770
than almost anyone.

1375
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:24,640
There are a lot

1376
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:24,640
of other factors

1377
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:24,640
that come into play

1378
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:26,710
when you're making

1379
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:26,710
a hire like this.

1380
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:28,840
But the job should've been

1381
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:28,840
mine to lose. So, why?

1382
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:35,160
Is it because of Dr. Asher?

1383
00:36:37,290 --> 00:36:39,380
Because I fell in love

1384
00:36:37,290 --> 00:36:39,380
with someone

1385
00:36:37,290 --> 00:36:39,380
struggling with drugs?

1386
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,390
Well...

1387
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:45,330
Since you bring it up,

1388
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:45,330
that didn't help.

1389
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:50,190
You know, sometimes,

1390
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:50,190
you make very poor decisions.

1391
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:53,670
I admit, I have made

1392
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:53,670
some mistakes in the past.

1393
00:36:54,940 --> 00:37:00,470
It's not what you've done,

1394
00:36:54,940 --> 00:37:00,470
it's how you've done it,

1395
00:36:54,940 --> 00:37:00,470
Dr. Halstead.

1396
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:03,210
You're impulsive,

1397
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:03,210
you break the rules,

1398
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:06,620
you trust your gut

1399
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:06,620
over everything

1400
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:06,620
and everyone else.

1401
00:37:07,290 --> 00:37:09,450
And hey,

1402
00:37:07,290 --> 00:37:09,450
sometimes, it works.

1403
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:14,950
But it's just not

1404
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:14,950
the way to run an ED.

1405
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,190
The truth is,

1406
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:20,600
I didn't even consider you

1407
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:20,600
for this job.

1408
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:25,660
I understand.

1409
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:30,670
Thank you for your candor.

1410
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:48,420
Dr. Virani!

1411
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:50,960
Dr. Virani, hold up.

1412
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:57,900
How are you feeling?

1413
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:58,990
Okay.

1414
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:01,240
Extra ice chips?

1415
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:02,530
Oh, thank you.

1416
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:04,370
Well...

1417
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,000
You must have been

1418
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,000
popping a whole lot

1419
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,000
of NSAIDs.

1420
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:07,300
I know.

1421
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,770
I've been getting

1422
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,770
migraines lately.

1423
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,510
I remember

1424
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,510
when you used to

1425
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,510
get those from stress.

1426
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:12,680
Mmm-hmm.

1427
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:13,910
Like the time

1428
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:13,910
we moved to Hyde Park.

1429
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:15,250
Oh.

1430
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,450
Yeah.

1431
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:18,860
Yeah,

1432
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:18,860
moving can be stressful.

1433
00:38:19,790 --> 00:38:23,990
Especially, uh,

1434
00:38:19,790 --> 00:38:23,990
long distances

1435
00:38:19,790 --> 00:38:23,990
to, say, some place

1436
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,990
like Arizona.

1437
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,620
How did you know?

1438
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,030
Anna saw

1439
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,030
some of your emails.

1440
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:32,030
She's been snooping

1441
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:32,030
in my computer?

1442
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:33,700
When were you

1443
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:33,700
gonna tell me?

1444
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:37,340
Look, they've been talking

1445
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:37,340
about transferring me

1446
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:37,340
to Phoenix.

1447
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,040
It's a great opportunity.

1448
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:43,910
I suppose you'd be wanting

1449
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:43,910
to take Anna with you?

1450
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:46,820
You know,

1451
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:46,820
if it happens, yes.

1452
00:38:47,390 --> 00:38:50,880
Do you think this was

1453
00:38:47,390 --> 00:38:50,880
an easy decision for me?

1454
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:52,920
I knew this was

1455
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:52,920
gonna go like this.

1456
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:54,020
What do you expect?

1457
00:38:54,330 --> 00:38:55,760
You're taking my daughter

1458
00:38:54,330 --> 00:38:55,760
to Ari-freaking-zona!

1459
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:57,490
Dan, please, can we...

1460
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:00,520
Mind if I interrupt?

1461
00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:02,520
No.

1462
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,000
Nope, that's perfect.

1463
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,000
I was just leaving.

1464
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:07,800
Yeah. Well, take care

1465
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:07,800
of yourself.

1466
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:09,600
Okay.

1467
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:09,600
All right.

1468
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:09,600
We'll talk some more.

1469
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:10,730
Okay.

1470
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:18,510
Hey, Daniel,

1471
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:18,510
I'm sorry, man.

1472
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:19,640
I didn't mean to get

1473
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:19,640
in the middle of that.

1474
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:20,810
Middle of what?

1475
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:23,720
Well, I know what it's like,

1476
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:23,720
I got an ex myself.

1477
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:24,850
Oh.

1478
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,650
Yeah.

1479
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,650
Congratulations.

1480
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,950
So, if you ever

1481
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,950
need someone to talk to,

1482
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:31,390
I'm available.

1483
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:31,390
I appreciate that.

1484
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:32,760
Hey, I mean that.

1485
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:32,760
No, really, I do.

1486
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,330
Okay. All right.

1487
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:54,480
Hey.

1488
00:40:01,530 --> 00:40:03,050
Just came

1489
00:40:01,530 --> 00:40:03,050
from the COVID wing.

1490
00:40:04,530 --> 00:40:08,870
Saw Alejandra Cruz

1491
00:40:04,530 --> 00:40:08,870
was admitted across

1492
00:40:04,530 --> 00:40:08,870
the hall from Yesenia.

1493
00:40:09,770 --> 00:40:10,760
It isn't fair.

1494
00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:17,070
We just...

1495
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:20,480
We have to keep doing

1496
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:20,480
everything we can.

1497
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:22,420
It's never enough.
