1
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:07,500
This patient

2
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:07,500
harms herself

3
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:07,500
to get attention.

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,470
I'm not available to give you

5
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,470
the kind of care you need.

6
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:11,130
But I want you.

7
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:14,300
Where's Ramona?

8
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:16,000
Check the front.

9
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:16,000
Tell security.

10
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,000
Did you snow him to

11
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,000
force him into surgery?

12
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:19,240
Why would I do that?

13
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:21,110
I think you're

14
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:21,110
suffering from PTSD.

15
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:23,550
That's why I keep pushing you

16
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:23,550
to talk to Dr. Charles.

17
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:25,040
What's going on?

18
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:26,180
Something's off.

19
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:29,050
I don't have

20
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:29,050
the bandwidth to worry

21
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:29,050
about anyone else.

22
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,320
I need some space.

23
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:34,320
The drug we're testing,

24
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:37,330
any idea how it might affect

25
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:37,330
a patient with an LVAD?

26
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:41,460
If there's a patient suffering

27
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:41,460
any adverse reaction,

28
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:41,460
it needs to be reported.

29
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:43,630
If we can keep

30
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:43,630
from getting caught,

31
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:46,470
your mom may not ever

32
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:46,470
need a transplant.

33
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:48,780
Will, I do not want to

34
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:48,780
put you in this position.

35
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,580
You let me worry about that.

36
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,710
Hey, Sabeena.

37
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,550
I haven't seen you

38
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,550
around the ED lately.

39
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:00,520
Haven't seen you

40
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:00,520
around the trial office.

41
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,280
Though, I don't blame you.

42
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:05,190
I have been a little hard

43
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:05,190
on you lately.

44
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:06,590
I had it coming.

45
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:07,690
It's true.

46
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:14,800
Last round of follow-ups

47
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:14,800
going okay?

48
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:16,160
Everything looks good.

49
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:18,760
A few more left to go,

50
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:18,760
and we're done.

51
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:20,170
That's great.

52
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:23,040
You know what

53
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:23,040
that means, right?

54
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:26,310
Kender starts the first stage

55
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:26,310
of data analysis.

56
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:34,220
Wait.

57
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:34,220
Is there still a chance?

58
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,450
You and me?

59
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:37,560
Just a slight chance.

60
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:42,460
Well, in that case,

61
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:42,460
you better get to work.

62
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,230
Come on, get upstairs.

63
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,230
Move it.

64
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:54,100
Course guide.

65
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:54,100
Going back to school?

66
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,080
Got my interview for

67
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,080
Med's Nurse Practitioner

68
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,080
program today.

69
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,080
Squeezed in

70
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,080
under the deadline.

71
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:01,080
I'm sure you'll do great.

72
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:04,610
Are you okay?

73
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:08,220
You haven't

74
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:08,220
seemed yourself lately.

75
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:14,260
No, just been working

76
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:14,260
some late nights.

77
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,760
You know how it goes.

78
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:18,260
Okay.

79
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:23,530
Great, thanks.

80
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,240
Will! I need

81
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,240
a little help.

82
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,310
Where should we go?

83
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,310
Treatment Five.

84
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:29,400
What's going on?

85
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:30,600
I think Mom's

86
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:30,600
in liver failure.

87
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:32,650
Do you think this

88
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:32,650
is from the trial meds?

89
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,110
I don't know.

90
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,340
Hey, Carol.

91
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,340
Does your belly hurt?

92
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:38,320
Yes, it does.

93
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,880
Okay. Let's get you

94
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,880
into bed.

95
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,880
Okay.

96
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,180
Come on, Mom.

97
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:46,650
Hey, Carol.

98
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:46,650
Hi, Crockett.

99
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,320
Hi, how you doing?

100
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,320
Okay. Thank you.

101
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:52,260
Come on.

102
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:52,260
Okay.

103
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:54,500
There you go. Easy.

104
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:54,500
Yeah. Thanks, guys. Oh!

105
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,230
Yeah. Jaundice, edema.

106
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,230
I think you're right.

107
00:02:58,370 --> 00:02:59,770
Hi.

108
00:02:58,370 --> 00:02:59,770
Liver failure?

109
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:04,510
How's her cardiac

110
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:04,510
function been?

111
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:04,510
You know, pretty good.

112
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:05,640
Yeah?

113
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:05,640
Yeah.

114
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,340
On just the standard meds?

115
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,250
Why? Shouldn't it be?

116
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:12,690
It's just, you hadn't

117
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:12,690
been responding before,

118
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:14,690
but it looks like

119
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:14,690
they're working well.

120
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,520
We'll need to do

121
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,520
a full workup.

122
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:20,720
Okay. I'll get a liver panel,

123
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:20,720
CBC, CMP, and coags.

124
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:22,190
Thanks, April.

125
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:22,190
And we'll need a list

126
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,600
of her medications as well.

127
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,600
Okay.

128
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:26,660
Okay.

129
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,230
This could be

130
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,230
a drug interaction.

131
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,530
We have to rule

132
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,530
everything out.

133
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:31,700
You're right.

134
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:31,700
But this doesn't

135
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:31,700
look surgical.

136
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:33,670
I'll take it from here.

137
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:33,670
You never know.

138
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,710
Could be an obstruction,

139
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,710
gallstones.

140
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:37,800
I better stay on

141
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:37,800
just to be safe.

142
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:38,940
Hey...

143
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:38,940
Yeah.

144
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,770
Um, I really appreciate

145
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,770
everything you're doing

146
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,770
to help.

147
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:46,950
And I promise, as soon

148
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:46,950
as this becomes surgical,

149
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:46,950
I will call you, okay?

150
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:54,600
Whatever you want.

151
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:54,600
I'll see you, Carol.

152
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:58,330
Thank you. Bye.

153
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,990
Hey, Maggie.

154
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,990
Morning, Sharon.

155
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,220
How's it going?

156
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,220
Okay.

157
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:24,920
It's just that tomorrow's

158
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:24,920
Vanessa's last day here.

159
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,520
I didn't handle things right.

160
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:29,260
Well, it's not an easy

161
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:29,260
situation.

162
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,230
I know. But I'm thinking,

163
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:33,860
maybe if I told her

164
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:33,860
the truth...

165
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,700
I don't like leaving things

166
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,700
the way that they are,

167
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:38,240
with the two of us at odds.

168
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:40,830
I don't know, Maggie,

169
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:40,830
once you take that step...

170
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:42,330
I know.

171
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:53,680
Morning, Dean.

172
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:53,680
Hey.

173
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:58,790
So, uh, I have to ask.

174
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:00,690
Have you sat down

175
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:00,690
with Dr. Charles yet?

176
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,820
Mmm.

177
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:06,620
Actually, he referred me

178
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:06,620
to a veterans' therapy group.

179
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:06,620
Went last night.

180
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,960
Really?

181
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,960
Yeah, yeah.

182
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,600
It was something, man.

183
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:13,770
The stories you hear,

184
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,610
the things people

185
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,610
have been through.

186
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:19,700
There's a deep well of pain

187
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:19,700
out there, man.

188
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,310
I can imagine.

189
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,540
Bet you had

190
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,540
some stories, too.

191
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:25,820
Oh, well, nothing worth saying

192
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:25,820
compared to what I heard

193
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:25,820
last night.

194
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:29,790
And I wanna thank you

195
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:29,790
for leaning on me.

196
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,430
Last night was inspiring.

197
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:34,500
I'm sorry.

198
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:34,500
Am I interrupting?

199
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:35,650
No, ma'am.

200
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:39,360
We have an 18-year-old

201
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:39,360
in Treatment Six.

202
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:41,070
And a few weeks ago,

203
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:44,500
she was diagnosed with

204
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:44,500
a cranial hemangioblastoma.

205
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:46,540
Eighteen, that's tough.

206
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:46,540
Yeah.

207
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,870
Do you two mind

208
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,870
taking a look?

209
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:50,840
Of course.

210
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:50,840
Thank you.

211
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,980
Mindy, is this the first time

212
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,980
you've passed out

213
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,980
since your diagnosis?

214
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:59,750
I just got dizzy for a second.

215
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:59,750
It's not a big deal!

216
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:00,910
Yes, it is.

217
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,750
When they diagnosed

218
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,750
her last month,

219
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:04,050
they said the tumor

220
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:04,050
was small.

221
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,660
Does this mean

222
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,660
it's growing?

223
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,850
Well, possibly.

224
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,690
Or it could mean

225
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,690
there's a bleed.

226
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,890
Either would be a reason

227
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,990
to recommend surgery

228
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,990
to remove it.

229
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,400
I'm not doing that.

230
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,440
But, sweetie,

231
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,440
if it's getting worse...

232
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,440
No!

233
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,100
No one's digging

234
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,100
through my brain!

235
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,800
She's spent the last month

236
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,800
glued to her computer,

237
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:19,900
reading horror stories

238
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:19,900
about brain surgery.

239
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:23,040
They're not just stories, Dad.

240
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:23,040
People come out changed.

241
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,070
They stutter,

242
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,070
they have seizures,

243
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:26,780
they forget everybody's names.

244
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:30,510
I play the piano.

245
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,090
What if I can't

246
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,090
do that anymore?

247
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:34,490
Uh-uh. No way.

248
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:36,490
Okay, before we

249
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:36,490
go any further,

250
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:38,960
why don't we get a CT

251
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:38,960
to see what

252
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:38,960
we're dealing with?

253
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:40,960
Then we can talk again

254
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:40,960
and come up with a plan.

255
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:43,660
Yeah, yeah.

256
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,820
We'll be right back.

257
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,820
Excuse us.

258
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:52,700
Her oncologist wanted

259
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:52,700
to remove the tumor

260
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:54,370
back when she was

261
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:54,370
first diagnosed.

262
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,600
But you can see there's

263
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,600
no talking to her.

264
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,710
Is there any way that...

265
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:00,150
Can we make her do it?

266
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:03,510
Uh, I'm sorry, but no.

267
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:06,590
She's 18 years old.

268
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:06,590
She has the right

269
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:06,590
to make her own decisions.

270
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:10,620
But she's still a kid.

271
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:10,620
She doesn't understand

272
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:10,620
the consequences.

273
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:13,520
We're at our wits' end.

274
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:13,520
We don't know what else to do.

275
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:16,390
Look, I see

276
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:16,390
how distressing this is,

277
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:16,390
and understandably so.

278
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:19,660
But there is one thing,

279
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:19,660
as parents, you can do.

280
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:21,690
Tell us.

281
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,860
You can apply for temporary

282
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,860
power of attorney.

283
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:26,440
This would give you

284
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:26,440
the ability to make

285
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:26,440
medical decisions,

286
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,530
should she

287
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,530
become unconscious.

288
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,170
You can do it

289
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,170
with her consent.

290
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:34,440
But using it to get

291
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:34,440
a procedure she doesn't want

292
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:36,980
would still be circumventing

293
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:36,980
your daughter's stated wishes.

294
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:39,850
With the goal

295
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:39,850
of saving her life.

296
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,490
Okay. Can we discuss it?

297
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,490
Of course.

298
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,550
Uh, in the meantime,

299
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,550
I'll order a CT.

300
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:00,110
Mom's going up

301
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:00,110
for her echo now.

302
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:01,510
Are those her labs?

303
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:04,910
Yeah. It is

304
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:04,910
acute liver failure.

305
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:06,500
Oh, God.

306
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:08,450
And look at this.

307
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:11,840
Hepatitis C?

308
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:14,620
She must've been carrying it

309
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:14,620
a long time asymptomatically.

310
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,090
Which means

311
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,090
something happened

312
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,090
to push her over the edge.

313
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,530
Do you think

314
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,530
it's a drug interaction?

315
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:22,930
I'm not sure what else

316
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:22,930
it could be.

317
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:25,500
We have to take her off

318
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:25,500
the trial medication.

319
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:26,860
That's our only choice.

320
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:28,800
Oh, God.

321
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:31,960
I know. I'll put her back

322
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:31,960
on her old cardiac meds

323
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:33,910
until we get

324
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:33,910
her liver failure

325
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:33,910
under control.

326
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:36,570
And then what?

327
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:36,570
I'll find something.

328
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,140
Thanks.

329
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,210
Yeah.

330
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:43,880
I found her

331
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:43,880
sitting on a bench.

332
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:46,080
She said that

333
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:46,080
she wanted to talk to you.

334
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:46,080
Wow.

335
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,250
Thanks, Mags.

336
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,250
Yeah.

337
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:53,790
Hi, Dr. Charles.

338
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,660
Ramona, how you doing?

339
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,660
Good. Very good.

340
00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:01,000
You gave me a real scare,

341
00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:01,000
running out of here

342
00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:01,000
like you did last time.

343
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,540
I'm glad to see

344
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,540
you're okay.

345
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:05,830
I'm sorry, but there's

346
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:05,830
no reason for you to worry.

347
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:08,710
So, um, what's going on?

348
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:08,710
What can I do for you?

349
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,600
Actually, I just wanted you

350
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,600
to know that I'm fine.

351
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,910
Oh. That's great.

352
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,910
And you know what?

353
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:17,080
I really appreciate you

354
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:17,080
letting me know. I do.

355
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:20,620
Yeah. I just got

356
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:20,620
a new apartment,

357
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:20,620
and I'm working.

358
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,560
I'm just temping now,

359
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,560
but I think they'll

360
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,560
keep me on full-time.

361
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:26,620
Wow. Things are

362
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:26,620
really looking up.

363
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:27,890
They are.

364
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,990
So, I thought,

365
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,990
if you had a little

366
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,990
free time,

367
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,960
maybe we could get

368
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,960
a cup of coffee.

369
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,800
You know what?

370
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,800
I am in the middle

371
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,800
of my workday.

372
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:38,800
But I really would like

373
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:38,800
to hear about what's been

374
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:38,800
going on with you.

375
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:42,210
So, um, what do you say...

376
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:42,210
I don't know,

377
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:42,210
let's make an appointment.

378
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:44,800
Meet in my office

379
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:44,800
and have a proper chat?

380
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,710
I just thought

381
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,710
we could hang out.

382
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,710
Probably better

383
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,710
that we make an appointment.

384
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:53,690
I tell you what.

385
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:53,690
Call me anytime.

386
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:53,690
Okay? I mean it.

387
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,290
If you don't get me,

388
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,290
leave a message.

389
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:57,250
I'll call you

390
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:57,250
right back. Okay?

391
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:58,790
Okay.

392
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:58,790
Great.

393
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,860
Really good

394
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,860
to see you, Ramona. Really.

395
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,820
It's good to see you, too.

396
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:07,630
Dr. Marcel, incoming.

397
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,900
What do we got?

398
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,900
Baghdad.

399
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,340
Twenty-six-year-old male

400
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,340
in respiratory distress.

401
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:15,270
Status, post double lung

402
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:15,270
transplant eight days ago.

403
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:16,970
James?

404
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:16,970
You know him?

405
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,100
Yeah. I was his surgeon.

406
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:20,010
Hillary, hey,

407
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:20,010
what happened?

408
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:22,880
He started having trouble

409
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:22,880
breathing the day after

410
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:22,880
we got home.

411
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:25,680
His pulmonologist said

412
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:25,680
to continue taking his meds,

413
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:29,020
but he just kept getting worse

414
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:29,020
until today, he got a fever.

415
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,030
Yeah, okay. All right.

416
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:33,320
James, we're gonna take

417
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:33,320
good care of you, bud. Okay?

418
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:36,150
On my count.

419
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:36,150
One, two, three.

420
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,130
There we go.

421
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:41,330
James, on a scale

422
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:41,330
of one to ten,

423
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:41,330
how hard is it to breathe?

424
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,800
Eight. Maybe a nine.

425
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:49,070
O2 sats 85 on 12 liters.

426
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:49,070
And he's tachycardic at 106.

427
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,370
Deep breaths for me, James.

428
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:55,280
Yeah. Major consolidation

429
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:55,280
in both lungs.

430
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:58,620
Let's order cultures,

431
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:58,620
lytes, CBC with diff,

432
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:58,620
cyclosporine level,

433
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,920
and get him up

434
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,920
for a chest CT, stat.

435
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,920
Got it.

436
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:03,020
Let me see your hands, bud.

437
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,920
Is he rejecting the lungs?

438
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:07,120
No. He's immunosuppressed,

439
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:07,120
so, he shouldn't be.

440
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,360
But he's definitely got

441
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,360
a bilateral pneumonia.

442
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:10,820
The question is why.

443
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:14,630
James? I wanna get you

444
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:14,630
on a BiPAP machine to help

445
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:14,630
you breathe. Is that okay?

446
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,340
Okay. You hang in there

447
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,340
for me, okay?

448
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,300
I'll check back soon,

449
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,300
all right?

450
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:25,250
So soon after surgery.

451
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:25,250
What do you think happened?

452
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:27,750
Yeah, I'm not sure yet.

453
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:30,910
But I do know when

454
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:30,910
it goes this bad this fast,

455
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:33,880
surgeon error is always

456
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:33,880
at the top of the list.

457
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:44,390
You find anything yet?

458
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:48,170
There's not a single case

459
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:48,170
of liver failure

460
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:48,170
in the entire trial.

461
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,410
If it is a contraindication,

462
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,410
then Kender needs to know.

463
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:56,230
Yeah.

464
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:59,280
I guess I should

465
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:59,280
go find Dr. Virani.

466
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:02,340
Uh...

467
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:02,340
I need to let her know.

468
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:06,910
No. She's not in yet.

469
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:06,910
Don't worry. I'll handle it.

470
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,280
No, I stole the pills.

471
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:11,120
I gave them

472
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:11,120
to my mom illegally.

473
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,990
I need to be the one

474
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,990
to tell her myself.

475
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,790
Sure.

476
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:30,770
Hey, James. Hillary.

477
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:34,840
Dr. Marcel. Have you

478
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:34,840
figured out what's going on?

479
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:38,010
So, I've looked at the labs,

480
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:38,010
the scans.

481
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:41,990
The only reason

482
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:41,990
I can come up with for getting

483
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:41,990
a pneumonia this fast,

484
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:45,220
was that something

485
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:45,220
must've gone wrong during

486
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:45,220
the transplant surgery.

487
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:48,950
Wrong? What do you mean?

488
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:53,360
Well, the lungs

489
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:53,360
could've mismatched,

490
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:53,360
a stitch could've come loose.

491
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,400
I'm really not sure.

492
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:58,760
So, what do we do now?

493
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:58,760
How do we fix this?

494
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:02,240
Honestly, the options

495
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:02,240
are not good.

496
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:09,340
As you can see, the pneumonia

497
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:09,340
has already caused significant

498
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:09,340
damage to both lungs.

499
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:12,050
At this point, we need

500
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:12,050
to put you on ECMO,

501
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:14,820
a machine that oxygenates

502
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:14,820
your blood for you.

503
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:17,520
For how long?

504
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:18,820
It's hard to say.

505
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:21,900
But if we end up

506
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:21,900
having to search

507
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:21,900
for a new pair of lungs,

508
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,230
it could be several

509
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,230
more months.

510
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:29,500
Wait. Are you saying that

511
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:29,500
these lungs can't be saved?

512
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:35,100
I'm not saying that.

513
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:35,100
But it is possible.

514
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:42,250
I'm so sorry

515
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:42,250
this happened. I...

516
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:47,220
Look, I promise you,

517
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:47,220
I'm going to do

518
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:47,220
everything I...

519
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:56,190
I'll give you some space.

520
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,870
James' new X-ray.

521
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,180
Lungs are just

522
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,180
getting worse.

523
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,570
Damn it.

524
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,220
When I was

525
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,220
on the COVID ward,

526
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,310
I saw a lot of films

527
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,310
that looked just like that.

528
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:20,910
Is it possible

529
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:20,910
he's infected?

530
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:24,330
No. The donor was negative.

531
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:27,590
And James tested negative

532
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:27,590
when he came in today.

533
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,460
I understand. But maybe

534
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,460
it's worth retesting him.

535
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,860
No. The truth is,

536
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,860
you were right.

537
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,600
My head has been completely

538
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,600
out of the game lately.

539
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:42,030
And because of that,

540
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:43,910
I may have cost

541
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:43,910
this man his life.

542
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:47,510
If there's any donor tissue,

543
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,110
we could check,

544
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,110
just in case...

545
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:51,120
April, I appreciate

546
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:51,120
everything you're doing.

547
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:54,280
I do. Now, please,

548
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:54,280
call the ECMO team.

549
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,190
And let's get

550
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,190
this man hooked up

551
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:59,850
before his lungs

552
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:59,850
completely fail.

553
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:16,430
Hey, Irma.

554
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:16,430
Hey!

555
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,310
Can you look up

556
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,310
the records of

557
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,310
an organ donor?

558
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:21,910
I need to know if there's

559
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:21,910
any lung tissue

560
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:21,910
you can test for COVID.

561
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:23,210
Sure, I'll check

562
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:23,210
for you, April.

563
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:28,380
No, no lung tissue.

564
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:28,380
Okay. Thanks.

565
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:31,220
But we do have

566
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:31,220
some deep washings.

567
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:33,490
Can you test that?

568
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:33,490
Sure.

569
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:35,990
But I'd need a doctor's order.

570
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:46,000
Here.

571
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:46,000
Really, April?

572
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:48,300
Come on. You gonna make me

573
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:48,300
go back upstairs?

574
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,280
Okay, "Dr. Marcel."

575
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:54,140
I'll call you

576
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:54,140
when it's ready.

577
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:55,650
Thank you.

578
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:55,650
All right.

579
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:01,540
You know, it's wonderful that

580
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:01,540
you're doing so well. Really.

581
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,630
I guess what

582
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,630
I'm curious about

583
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,420
is what happened

584
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,420
in the last four weeks.

585
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:10,430
Oh, God. The self-harming,

586
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:10,430
I mean, the poison?

587
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:12,060
It all seems

588
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:12,060
like a bad dream now.

589
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:14,570
I realized stuff like that

590
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:14,570
was crazy.

591
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:16,030
Wow.

592
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:17,130
That is great.

593
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,430
You know,

594
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,430
that's a huge step.

595
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,430
Really.

596
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:23,270
Any insights into why

597
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:23,270
you were doing that stuff?

598
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:25,580
What do you mean?

599
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,650
As I recall,

600
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,650
we were talking a lot about

601
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,650
your family, all right?

602
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:31,050
And in particular, your dad,

603
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:34,990
and how you thought

604
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:34,990
that your relationship

605
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:34,990
changed as you got older?

606
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:38,180
Dr. Charles, you always

607
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:38,180
come back to that.

608
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:38,180
My father.

609
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:40,660
I mean, I thought

610
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:40,660
we were just gonna

611
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:40,660
hang out and catch up.

612
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,730
Isn't that kinda

613
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,730
what we're doing?

614
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,230
Okay. My father molested me

615
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,230
when I was little. A lot.

616
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:52,360
I wished every day

617
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:52,360
that it wouldn't happen,

618
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:52,360
but it would,

619
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:54,370
and there was nothing

620
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:54,370
I could do about it.

621
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:59,210
Ramona, I am

622
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:59,210
so sorry to hear that.

623
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:02,050
It's okay.

624
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:04,040
You know what?

625
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:04,040
It's not okay.

626
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:08,050
I mean, I can't imagine

627
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:08,050
how difficult,

628
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,990
how awful that must have been

629
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,990
for you to go through that.

630
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:13,460
It was.

631
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,360
But it's all

632
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,360
in the past now.

633
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,290
You know,

634
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,290
in my experience,

635
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:22,700
recognizing that

636
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:22,700
something like that happened,

637
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:27,100
as crucial as it is,

638
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:27,100
and then processing it,

639
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:29,070
are actually

640
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:29,070
two different things.

641
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:32,740
Okay, look, no.

642
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:32,740
I have processed it.

643
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:35,150
That's what

644
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:35,150
I'm trying to tell you.

645
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:36,650
I completely understand

646
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:36,650
how it might feel...

647
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,450
No. Okay, see, we don't

648
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,450
need to talk about this.

649
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:41,320
You and I can just be friends.

650
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:41,320
Regular friends.

651
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:46,250
Ramona, I am absolutely

652
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:46,250
100% here for you

653
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:46,250
as your doctor.

654
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,730
Okay. Stop! I don't

655
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,730
need a psychiatrist!

656
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,730
Ramona...

657
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:50,490
Ramona, sit down.

658
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:50,490
Why won't you listen to me?

659
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,160
I am fine!

660
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,160
Ramona.

661
00:17:57,670 --> 00:18:00,730
Okay. Yeah. Bye.

662
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:03,130
Maggie, I've got some orders

663
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:03,130
for Treatment Two.

664
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,740
Okay, sure. Oh, wait.

665
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,740
Mmm-hmm.

666
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:08,410
Can we meet up

667
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:08,410
at the end of the day?

668
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,520
Did I make a mistake?

669
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:15,390
Uh, no, it's just we use some

670
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:15,390
different abbreviations here,

671
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:16,790
and the doctors

672
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:16,790
are sticklers on it.

673
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:20,320
So, I thought

674
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:20,320
we could just meet up

675
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:20,320
and go over them.

676
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,290
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

677
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:27,260
All right. Yeah. Right.

678
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,270
Nat. Your mom's EKG.

679
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:35,470
She developed

680
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:35,470
a long QT interval?

681
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:37,510
Exactly, but there's

682
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:37,510
an upside to that.

683
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:39,810
She's now a candidate

684
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:39,810
for biventricular pacing.

685
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:42,780
The cath lab?

686
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:42,780
But she's still

687
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:42,780
in acute liver failure.

688
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,750
Yeah, but it's a heart issue,

689
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,750
nothing to do with the liver.

690
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:48,820
It's a major procedure,

691
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:48,820
and she's extremely sick.

692
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,350
Yeah. If we don't

693
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,350
try something,

694
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:52,690
she could go into a dangerous

695
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:52,690
arrhythmia at any moment.

696
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:54,820
But it's not a cure,

697
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:56,360
and she still needs

698
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:56,360
a heart transplant.

699
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:59,870
That's right. And this is our

700
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:59,870
best shot at keeping her alive

701
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:59,870
until she gets one.

702
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,640
I don't know, Will.

703
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:04,370
There are so many

704
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:04,370
potential complications.

705
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:08,100
This is your mom. I'm not

706
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:08,100
leaving any stone unturned.

707
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:13,710
Okay. Let's give it a try.

708
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:15,810
I'll set it up.

709
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,390
Lead's in

710
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,390
the coronary sinus.

711
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:30,790
Just putting in the wire.

712
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,170
These veins

713
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,170
are extremely tortuous.

714
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:35,760
I'm getting a lot

715
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:35,760
of resistance.

716
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,430
How about

717
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,430
a venography balloon

718
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,430
to anchor you in?

719
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:40,370
That'd be great. Susie?

720
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:41,870
I'm on it.

721
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:43,170
Carol, how you doing?

722
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:46,640
Oh, I'm great.

723
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:46,640
Good.

724
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,410
Shouldn't be much longer.

725
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,420
We're just grabbing

726
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,420
an extra piece of equipment.

727
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,280
Okay, Will.

728
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:55,510
Just take your...

729
00:19:57,390 --> 00:19:59,220
Carol?

730
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:01,360
Her pressure's dropping.

731
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:01,360
Heart rate's up to 180.

732
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:03,830
What's happening?

733
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:03,830
She's in SVT. Bag her.

734
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:06,370
Carol? Carol!

735
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:09,770
She's unresponsive.

736
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:09,770
Looks like tamponade.

737
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:13,530
The wire must've perforated

738
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:13,530
her heart. 60cc syringe.

739
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,370
Mom? Mom!

740
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:16,500
Syringe.

741
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,540
She's gonna arrest

742
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,540
if you don't get in there now.

743
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:21,670
I think I'm in.

744
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:24,440
No. Nothing.

745
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:26,380
Angle it deeper.

746
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:26,380
Charge to 200.

747
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:30,610
Hold up!

748
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:36,860
I've got blood.

749
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:36,860
Rhythm's back.

750
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:40,390
Heart rate's down.

751
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:40,390
Pulse is strong.

752
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,730
All right, set up

753
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,730
for continuous drainage.

754
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:58,720
Hey, Vanessa brought

755
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:58,720
her parents in and wants them

756
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:58,720
to meet everyone.

757
00:20:58,850 --> 00:20:59,880
Oh.

758
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:02,390
And this is our

759
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:02,390
charge nurse, Maggie.

760
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:02,390
Sure.

761
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:03,960
She keeps the place running.

762
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,890
Maggie, these are my parents,

763
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,890
Kent and Bea.

764
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:07,550
Hi.

765
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:07,550
Hello.

766
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:11,530
Nice to meet you.

767
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:11,530
Your daughter is great.

768
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:13,000
She just loves

769
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:13,000
working here.

770
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,630
She can't stop talking

771
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,630
about the patients,

772
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:15,790
how much

773
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:15,790
she's learning...

774
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,930
Okay, Mom.

775
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,930
What?

776
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,340
You do.

777
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,340
Okay.

778
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,700
Ah, parents...

779
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,700
Such an embarrassment.

780
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:22,780
Ugh, come on!

781
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:22,780
Let me show you where

782
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:22,780
the ambulances come in.

783
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,940
So nice to meet you.

784
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,940
Likewise.

785
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,850
Dr. Choi!

786
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,850
Dr. Archer!

787
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:35,290
She's not waking up!

788
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:36,550
Mindy?

789
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:36,550
What's going on?

790
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:38,750
The bleed must've gotten

791
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:38,750
much worse,

792
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:38,750
faster than we expected.

793
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:41,520
What can we do?

794
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:41,520
You can use

795
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:41,520
your power of attorney.

796
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:43,260
Say the word, and we'll

797
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:43,260
take her right up to surgery.

798
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,700
But I'm sure we'd all

799
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,700
rather have Mindy

800
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,320
make this decision.

801
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,320
How?

802
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,630
We can drill a hole

803
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,630
in her skull right here

804
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,630
to release the pressure.

805
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:51,760
Then when she wakes up,

806
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:51,760
we can explain the situation

807
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:51,760
and get her consent.

808
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:56,340
Let her make the choice.

809
00:21:56,910 --> 00:21:58,810
Okay.

810
00:21:56,910 --> 00:21:58,810
Dr. Choi, a minute, please?

811
00:21:58,910 --> 00:21:59,970
All right.

812
00:21:58,910 --> 00:21:59,970
Nancy, get the drill.

813
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,450
High-flow O2,

814
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,450
elevate her head.

815
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:04,880
We both know

816
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:04,880
she needs this surgery.

817
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:04,880
This is our chance.

818
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:07,350
Did you do this?

819
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:07,350
What?

820
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:08,920
Sedate her

821
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:08,920
to override her wishes?

822
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,420
I am trying

823
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,420
to save this girl's life.

824
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:12,930
I'm about to drill

825
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:12,930
a hole in her head.

826
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:14,020
Am I gonna see blood?

827
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:16,490
Drill the hole, Doctor.

828
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:19,020
Nancy?

829
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:33,540
Okay.

830
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:33,540
All right.

831
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,040
Keep her still.

832
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,040
Yeah.

833
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,780
I can't...

834
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:41,550
Ready?

835
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:41,550
Yeah.

836
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:48,320
Okay.

837
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:50,920
She's waking up.

838
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:50,920
Mindy, you're okay.

839
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:53,930
Do you want me to

840
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:53,930
set up a drain

841
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:53,930
for the rest of the blood?

842
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:55,930
Yeah.

843
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:00,670
Hey, Mindy.

844
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:00,670
Huh?

845
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:02,540
Hey, you're okay.

846
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:10,680
Ramona,

847
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:10,680
it's Dr. Charles again.

848
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:13,080
I don't know

849
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:13,080
if you got my last message,

850
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:15,120
but I think it would be

851
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:15,120
a really good idea

852
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:18,880
for us to continue

853
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:18,880
our conversation.

854
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:21,690
So, I hope you call me back.

855
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,920
At least to let me know

856
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,920
that you're doing okay.

857
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:26,460
Okay.

858
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,390
Come in.

859
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:34,600
Hey.

860
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:34,600
Hello.

861
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,040
Almost done, huh?

862
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:39,140
Yes.

863
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:42,440
Good.

864
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:48,650
We never ended up

865
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:48,650
looking at interactions

866
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:48,650
with Hepatitis C, did we?

867
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:53,720
Of course not.

868
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:53,720
You know we screen all

869
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:53,720
Hep-positive patients out.

870
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:55,520
Right.

871
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:57,760
Though, if we knew

872
00:23:57,870 --> 00:24:01,060
there was a definite

873
00:23:57,870 --> 00:24:01,060
contraindication with Hep C,

874
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,000
that would be

875
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,000
good to know, right?

876
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:05,630
I suppose.

877
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:07,170
Why are you

878
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:07,170
bringing this up?

879
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:15,140
There is a patient

880
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:15,140
who's on the drug

881
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:15,140
who was not screened.

882
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:17,510
Did they slip

883
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:17,510
through our protocols?

884
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:20,120
No. It's not

885
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:20,120
that she slipped through.

886
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:22,420
It's that she's not

887
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:22,420
part of the trial.

888
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:27,930
Are you telling me

889
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:29,790
our drug went

890
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:29,790
to an outside patient?

891
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,030
Will, this is

892
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,030
a massive breach of protocol.

893
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:37,660
Who did this?

894
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:37,660
What's important

895
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:37,660
is that...

896
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:38,800
Dr. Halstead.

897
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:38,800
There's a very

898
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:38,800
sick woman...

899
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:42,040
Who gave

900
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:42,040
an unauthorized patient

901
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:42,040
our trial drug?

902
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,200
Me. I did.

903
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:49,780
I can't believe you.

904
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,650
You swore you would never do

905
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,650
anything like this again.

906
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:54,590
Sabeena, the patient

907
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:54,590
was out of options...

908
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:56,090
Stop making excuses!

909
00:24:57,690 --> 00:24:58,750
I trusted you,

910
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:02,030
and you betray me like this.

911
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,090
Who's the patient?

912
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:10,060
She's Natalie's mother.

913
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:17,570
That explains it all,

914
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:17,570
doesn't it?

915
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:26,980
You realize you have

916
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:26,980
quite possibly

917
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:26,980
compromised the trial,

918
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,020
not to mention your career.

919
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,090
You can leave.

920
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:03,090
Okay. Thank you so much.

921
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:07,150
Why isn't Mr. Barton

922
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:07,150
on ECMO?

923
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,590
I ordered a culture

924
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,590
of the lung donor's washings,

925
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:12,670
and told the ECMO tech

926
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:12,670
to hold off just...

927
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:14,630
That man in there is dying,

928
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:14,630
and every moment counts.

929
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,930
I know, but I just heard back

930
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,930
from the lab...

931
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,670
April, for you to ignore me

932
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,670
because of something

933
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:21,170
you think

934
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:21,170
you saw on an X-ray

935
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:21,170
is absolutely inexcusable.

936
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,680
Dr. Marcel, it's positive.

937
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:25,580
There were traces

938
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:25,580
of COVID DNA in the lungs.

939
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:43,760
I have COVID?

940
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:45,920
No,

941
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:45,920
you do not have COVID.

942
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:49,300
The lungs you were given

943
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:49,300
had been infected with COVID.

944
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,660
Even though the donor

945
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,660
tested negative?

946
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:53,030
He must've

947
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:53,030
already recovered.

948
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:55,080
But not before

949
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:55,080
the virus caused

950
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:57,910
widespread microscopic

951
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:57,910
damage to his lungs.

952
00:26:58,010 --> 00:27:00,640
None of which was visible

953
00:26:58,010 --> 00:27:00,640
at the time of the transplant.

954
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:03,580
But it made them

955
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:03,580
very susceptible

956
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:03,580
to pneumonia.

957
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,910
So, this wasn't

958
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,910
anybody's fault?

959
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:07,280
Just bad luck?

960
00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:10,220
It was.

961
00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:10,220
But the good news is

962
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,990
Dr. Marcel might be able

963
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,990
to save one of the lungs.

964
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:16,290
But this would be

965
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:16,290
a very risky surgery.

966
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:19,330
And even then,

967
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:19,330
I won't know until

968
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:19,330
I'm in there,

969
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:22,160
whether you'll have

970
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:22,160
enough functional lung

971
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:22,160
left to survive.

972
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:26,770
I could die?

973
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:26,770
Yes, you could.

974
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,240
So, if you'd rather

975
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,240
me not perform the surgery,

976
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:36,110
I can get you on ECMO

977
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:36,110
and we can start looking

978
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:36,110
for a new set of lungs.

979
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,210
Hey, it's okay.

980
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,110
James?

981
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:49,150
I trust you.

982
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:53,900
Okay. Then we're gonna

983
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:53,900
get you up there right now.

984
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,290
All right?

985
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:02,770
Right now, the drain

986
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:02,770
is keeping the pressure

987
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:02,770
from building up.

988
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,350
But she can only

989
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,350
stay on like this

990
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,350
for so long.

991
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:07,380
Are we talking days? Weeks?

992
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:08,910
Depends on several factors.

993
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,950
Whether the tumor

994
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,950
continues to grow,

995
00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:12,850
or whether the bleed

996
00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:12,850
breaks through the clot.

997
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:15,350
But she will eventually

998
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:15,350
need the surgery.

999
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,320
So, I suggest...

1000
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,320
Give me a minute

1001
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,320
with her. Okay?

1002
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:26,190
Hey.

1003
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:26,190
I don't need another

1004
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:26,190
lecture right now.

1005
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:29,200
I know you think

1006
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:29,200
I'm being stupid.

1007
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,900
Oh, come on.

1008
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,900
Are you kidding me?

1009
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:35,140
Sometimes, being scared

1010
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:35,140
is just about the smartest

1011
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:35,140
thing a person can be.

1012
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,440
Listen, I was a doctor

1013
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,440
in Iraq. All right?

1014
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:43,910
And, uh,

1015
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:43,910
we were in a town that

1016
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:43,910
was considered friendly.

1017
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:46,150
And I'm just standing there

1018
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:46,150
in the middle of the street,

1019
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:48,310
and all of a sudden,

1020
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:48,310
we start taking fire,

1021
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:50,690
seemed it was coming

1022
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:50,690
from every direction.

1023
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:53,060
And right off the bat,

1024
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:53,060
I'm hit.

1025
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:56,360
My left thigh,

1026
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:56,360
blood pouring out

1027
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:56,360
everywhere.

1028
00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:01,400
And so, I hightail it

1029
00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:01,400
to some stairwell.

1030
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:06,040
All right? It was hidden,

1031
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:06,040
it was relatively quiet,

1032
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:08,730
and all I wanted to do

1033
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:08,730
was just sit there

1034
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,210
and wait for

1035
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,210
the shooting to stop.

1036
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:17,780
I couldn't stop the bleeding.

1037
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:17,780
I tried, couldn't stop it.

1038
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:23,190
And after a while,

1039
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:23,190
I started feeling woozy,

1040
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:23,190
started getting cold.

1041
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,480
And I knew

1042
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,990
I was gonna die right there.

1043
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:37,330
All I could hear

1044
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:37,330
on the other side

1045
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:37,330
of that wall

1046
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,430
was shooting, all right?

1047
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:41,130
So, somehow,

1048
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,970
I just forced myself

1049
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,970
to run out of there,

1050
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,070
run right through the middle

1051
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,070
of that firefight.

1052
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:50,880
I'm running and running,

1053
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:53,180
and somehow,

1054
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:53,180
by some miracle, I made it.

1055
00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:58,760
Leaving that stairwell

1056
00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:58,760
was the hardest thing

1057
00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:58,760
I ever had to do.

1058
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:05,330
But it was what I needed

1059
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:05,330
to do to save my life.

1060
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:08,020
Do you understand?

1061
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:13,010
So, as scary as this is,

1062
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:18,080
if I'm there with you

1063
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:18,080
the whole time

1064
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:18,080
during this surgery,

1065
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:19,770
will you take

1066
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:19,770
that chance, too?

1067
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,350
It's really my only chance?

1068
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:28,380
Yeah, it is.

1069
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:38,320
Okay.

1070
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:40,290
Okay.

1071
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,170
Okay. Okay.

1072
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:49,400
Looks like

1073
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:49,400
you may have picked

1074
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:49,400
the right man for this job.

1075
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:51,530
Yeah.

1076
00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:02,060
Ramona, I'm so glad

1077
00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:02,060
that you...

1078
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:08,220
Okay, Ramona?

1079
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:08,220
Don't do anything.

1080
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,870
Don't move.

1081
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,870
I'll be right there.

1082
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,870
I'm on my way.

1083
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,040
Hey, Ramona.

1084
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:27,140
Any way I could

1085
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:27,140
get you to, um,

1086
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:27,140
step back onto the balcony,

1087
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:29,840
so, we could chat a bit?

1088
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:33,950
I keep wondering,

1089
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,990
would it make

1090
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,990
any difference

1091
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,990
if I jumped?

1092
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:42,160
Oh, it would make

1093
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:42,160
a great difference to me.

1094
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:45,560
I can tell you that.

1095
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:45,560
Hey. Easy, easy! Easy, easy.

1096
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:51,160
Ramona, it's okay.

1097
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:51,160
I just wanna talk.

1098
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:54,570
When I came

1099
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:54,570
to see you this morning,

1100
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:58,340
I just wanted to

1101
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:58,340
talk to someone

1102
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:58,340
like a normal person.

1103
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:01,580
Just have a conversation.

1104
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,250
Yeah. Okay.

1105
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:06,640
I just want a normal life.

1106
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:09,580
Yeah.

1107
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:14,250
So, Ramona, a normal life,

1108
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:16,390
what does that

1109
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:16,390
look like for you?

1110
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:19,260
It looks like

1111
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:23,200
not feeling like a freak.

1112
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:32,170
Like, not being

1113
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:32,170
totally alone all the time.

1114
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:33,940
Yeah.

1115
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:37,920
It looks like having

1116
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:42,490
maybe someone who...

1117
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:43,650
Who you could trust?

1118
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:47,250
Yeah.

1119
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:51,060
Somebody who always

1120
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:51,060
has your back, no matter what.

1121
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:54,130
Yes!

1122
00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:56,530
Ramona, look at me.

1123
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,600
Look at me.

1124
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:08,540
You can trust me.

1125
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:08,540
I absolutely have your back.

1126
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:11,950
And not just me,

1127
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:11,950
there's so much help

1128
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:11,950
for you out there.

1129
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:24,090
I'm scared.

1130
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:24,090
Of course you're scared.

1131
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,220
You've been through

1132
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,220
something awful.

1133
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:31,130
To really look at that,

1134
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:31,130
it's gotta be scary as hell.

1135
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:37,040
But you know what?

1136
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:37,040
I know that you are

1137
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:37,040
brave enough to do that.

1138
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,000
You do?

1139
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,000
I do.

1140
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:46,380
And I also know

1141
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:46,380
about a safe place

1142
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:46,380
where that could happen.

1143
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:51,550
What kind of safe place?

1144
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:53,320
It's a place where

1145
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:53,320
there are women

1146
00:33:54,090 --> 00:33:57,220
who have been through the same

1147
00:33:54,090 --> 00:33:57,220
kind of thing that you have.

1148
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:04,260
What would you think

1149
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:04,260
about maybe letting me

1150
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:04,260
take you there?

1151
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,680
I got you. I got you.

1152
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,680
I got you.

1153
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:21,250
It's okay, it's okay,

1154
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:21,250
it's okay. I got you.

1155
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:23,020
It'll be okay.

1156
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:36,460
He opened his eyes.

1157
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,540
Does that mean

1158
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,540
he's gonna be okay?

1159
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:42,510
It means he's waking up

1160
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:42,510
from anesthesia.

1161
00:34:42,610 --> 00:34:46,240
What matters is

1162
00:34:42,610 --> 00:34:46,240
if he's able

1163
00:34:42,610 --> 00:34:46,240
to follow commands.

1164
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:49,340
Hey, James. Hey.

1165
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:52,610
Squeeze my hand.

1166
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,280
Give it a good squeeze.

1167
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:02,620
Come on, give it

1168
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:02,620
everything you got.

1169
00:35:03,330 --> 00:35:05,090
There it is.

1170
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,630
That's good, right?

1171
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:11,730
Oh, my God,

1172
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:11,730
thank you both so much.

1173
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:17,570
Hi.

1174
00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:22,440
Hey, April.

1175
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:26,120
Look, I'm sorry about

1176
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:26,120
getting upset before.

1177
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:29,420
I shouldn't have.

1178
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:29,420
You saved his life.

1179
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,850
I'm just glad it worked out.

1180
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:32,860
Yeah.

1181
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:35,390
Hey, I never asked.

1182
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:35,390
How'd your interview go?

1183
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,290
Oh, my God!

1184
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:08,420
Hey.

1185
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,190
So, the pacer's

1186
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,190
not gonna be enough.

1187
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:17,300
Gift of Hope's got her

1188
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:17,300
at the top of

1189
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:17,300
the transplant list. Okay?

1190
00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:20,630
Hopefully, a new heart

1191
00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:20,630
will come up soon.

1192
00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:24,640
Oh, um,

1193
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:27,610
you know, I never did get

1194
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:27,610
to talk to Dr. Virani today.

1195
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:33,220
You know what?

1196
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:33,220
She never came in.

1197
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:34,710
Oh.

1198
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,790
Yeah. So, maybe, you can

1199
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,790
track her down tomorrow.

1200
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:42,620
Okay. I really hope

1201
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:42,620
you don't get

1202
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:42,620
into any trouble.

1203
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:45,860
I wouldn't worry about that.

1204
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:50,800
Thank you for everything

1205
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:50,800
you did today.

1206
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,230
Sure.

1207
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:11,480
Thank you.

1208
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:11,480
Yeah.

1209
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,350
She looks good.

1210
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:18,360
Yeah. I think it's gonna be

1211
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:18,360
a quick recovery.

1212
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:20,230
Dean, that story in Iraq.

1213
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:22,390
I had no idea you went

1214
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:22,390
through anything like that.

1215
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:25,200
Yeah, didn't we all?

1216
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:25,200
Not like that. I didn't.

1217
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:27,740
Yeah, okay. So...

1218
00:37:28,810 --> 00:37:29,800
Wait.

1219
00:37:32,610 --> 00:37:33,980
That story,

1220
00:37:32,610 --> 00:37:33,980
did you make it up?

1221
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:38,840
No. I did not make it up.

1222
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:42,610
Actually, I heard it

1223
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:42,610
from one of the guys

1224
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,850
in my vet's group.

1225
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:47,520
I mean, it's not exactly

1226
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:47,520
the same story,

1227
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:47,520
but it's close.

1228
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:49,560
Anyway, that reminds me,

1229
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:49,560
my group's about to start.

1230
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:50,930
So, I better get a move on.

1231
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:03,270
I got your page.

1232
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,830
Hey.

1233
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,240
Yeah.

1234
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:10,420
Look, Natalie,

1235
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:12,750
if you and Will

1236
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:12,750
are getting back together,

1237
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:12,750
just tell me.

1238
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:16,310
This not knowing,

1239
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:16,310
it's driving me crazy.

1240
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:18,820
No, Will and I

1241
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:18,820
are not getting back together.

1242
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:21,950
Okay, then what?

1243
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,560
I mean,

1244
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,560
you've been keeping secrets,

1245
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,560
shutting me out.

1246
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:27,830
Something's going on.

1247
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:35,830
What?

1248
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:40,910
I stole meds

1249
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:40,910
from Will's trial.

1250
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:46,410
My mom was so sick,

1251
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:46,410
and nothing was working.

1252
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,350
I was desperate.

1253
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,350
I wanted to tell you...

1254
00:38:48,450 --> 00:38:50,550
Oh.

1255
00:38:48,450 --> 00:38:50,550
...but I felt so guilty,

1256
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:52,020
and so afraid.

1257
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:54,930
And now, my mom

1258
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:54,930
is dying in there,

1259
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:56,760
and she needs a new heart,

1260
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:58,390
and I don't know what to do.

1261
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:01,390
Oh, honey. Come here.

1262
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,940
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1263
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:11,640
It's okay, Nat. It's okay.

1264
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:11,640
It's okay, it's okay.

1265
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:14,340
Okay. Yeah.

1266
00:39:15,450 --> 00:39:16,580
There you go. Thank you.

1267
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,890
Hey, you want to talk to me

1268
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,890
about abbreviations?

1269
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:21,350
I'll call you right back.

1270
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:24,680
Yes. I wrote them

1271
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:24,680
down for you.

1272
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:26,380
Cool.

1273
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:31,700
Your parents, they seem

1274
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:31,700
like really nice people.

1275
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:34,730
Yeah, they're great.

1276
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:34,730
Well, you know, parents.

1277
00:39:35,370 --> 00:39:37,390
Sure.

1278
00:39:35,370 --> 00:39:37,390
Yes. I get this.

1279
00:39:39,970 --> 00:39:42,470
Anything else, Maggie?

1280
00:39:39,970 --> 00:39:42,470
No. That's it.

1281
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,470
Okay. Yeah,

1282
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,470
I'll see you tomorrow.

1283
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:48,770
See you tomorrow.

1284
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:02,990
It looks nice.

1285
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,730
I think

1286
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,730
you're gonna find this

1287
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,730
a pretty special place.

1288
00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:09,860
Hey, Daniel.

1289
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:15,940
Ramona, this is Dr. Garner.

1290
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,140
Oh, please, call me Anne.

1291
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:20,810
It's nice

1292
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:20,810
to meet you, Ramona.

1293
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,070
Your room is ready,

1294
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:27,420
and there's breakfast

1295
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:27,420
in the kitchen

1296
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:27,420
if you're hungry.

1297
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:37,060
So, would you like to come in

1298
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:37,060
and meet everyone?

1299
00:40:41,570 --> 00:40:42,630
Mmm-hmm.

1300
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:44,140
Okay.
