1
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:08,470
When I was on

2
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:08,470
the COVID ward, I felt like

3
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:08,470
I was a part of something.

4
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:09,700
I'd like to feel that again.

5
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,000
The study's

6
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,000
exclusionary criteria

7
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,000
weed out a lot of patients.

8
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:14,100
I'd like to help.

9
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:18,240
The, uh, transfer to Arizona

10
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:18,240
came through.

11
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:20,250
You can't just take Anna

12
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:20,250
a thousand miles away

13
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:21,510
without discussing it

14
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:21,510
with me.

15
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:23,350
Dad, I don't wanna

16
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:23,350
go to Phoenix!

17
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,110
We really want to end up

18
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,110
in court over this?

19
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:30,720
I thought it was over

20
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:30,720
for us today.

21
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:30,720
Yeah, me, too.

22
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,170
You're good to go,

23
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,170
Dr. Halstead.

24
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:18,170
Booster in two weeks.

25
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:19,300
Thank you.

26
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:26,780
Will, good morning.

27
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,120
Morning. Thank you.

28
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:32,650
Pretty exciting day, huh?

29
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:37,690
I have to admit, I got

30
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:37,690
a little teary-eyed

31
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:37,690
walking in here.

32
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:40,590
After all these months...

33
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:40,590
Yeah, I know.

34
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,360
Finally, feels like

35
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,360
we're approaching

36
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,360
the other side of this.

37
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:46,500
Dr. Virani?

38
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,770
And not a moment too soon.

39
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:56,530
Morning, April.

40
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:57,670
Good morning.

41
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:59,480
Welcome back, Noah!

42
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:59,480
Hey.

43
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:00,710
Missed you around here.

44
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:02,580
How was the research rotation?

45
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:06,490
You know, it wasn't too bad.

46
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:06,490
Kind of interesting, actually.

47
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:08,380
Uh-oh. We losing him

48
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:08,380
to the bench?

49
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:10,620
Oh, no. I need him

50
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:10,620
where I can see him.

51
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,290
So, what's up with you?

52
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,560
Fresh cut, white coat.

53
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:16,260
What, big promotion,

54
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:16,260
or a girl?

55
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:19,290
Neither. I'm just trying

56
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:19,290
to step it up a little bit.

57
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,870
Look a little

58
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,870
more professional.

59
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:23,540
He is the co-PI on

60
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:23,540
a new clinical trial.

61
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:25,470
Okay, big time.

62
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,670
I'll catch you two later.

63
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,210
Leaving the little people

64
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,210
behind?

65
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,610
And I thought I was

66
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,610
a light sleeper.

67
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,180
Hey.

68
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,810
So, you slipped out on me

69
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,810
this morning. Didn't scare

70
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,810
you off, did I?

71
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,150
No.

72
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,880
I had to come in early,

73
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,880
catch up on some charting.

74
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:44,590
Thought you could

75
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:44,590
use the rest.

76
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:46,320
My place tonight?

77
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:48,120
We'll see.

78
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:53,600
Choi, Marcel, we got

79
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:53,600
two victims incoming!

80
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,370
Elderly couple found

81
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,370
unconscious in their home.

82
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:59,240
Both tested negative

83
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:59,240
for COVID in the ambo.

84
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:02,210
Phyllis Coleman, 68-year-old

85
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:02,210
female. Found pulseless

86
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:02,210
at the scene.

87
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:04,800
Compressions started

88
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:04,800
in the field, three rounds

89
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:04,800
of epi in the ambo.

90
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:06,210
We'll take her to Three.

91
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:06,210
Where's the husband?

92
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:07,300
Right behind me.

93
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:10,410
James Coleman,

94
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:10,410
69-year-old male,

95
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:10,410
obtunded but rousable.

96
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:13,610
BP 128/78. Pulse 110.

97
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:15,190
Any idea what

98
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:15,190
knocked 'em both out?

99
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:17,350
Gas leak.

100
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:17,350
Home reeked of sulfur.

101
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:18,520
Okay, what about this?

102
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:20,600
Looks like he fell out

103
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:20,600
of his chair after he

104
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:20,600
lost consciousness.

105
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:24,460
Here we go, on my count.

106
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:24,460
One, two, three.

107
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:30,600
All right. Lungs are clear.

108
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:33,830
Mr. Coleman! Can you hear me?

109
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,500
Maggie said you might

110
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,500
need some help.

111
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:37,940
Wait, is that Dr. Coleman?

112
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:39,850
You know him?

113
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:39,850
Guy's a legend.

114
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,880
Founded the largest free

115
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,880
clinic on the South Side.

116
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:44,480
That's right. Read about him

117
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:44,480
in the Trib.

118
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:46,680
Dr. Marcel, he's barely

119
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:46,680
protecting his airway.

120
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:49,760
Sexton, set up a nasal airway.

121
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:49,760
There we go.

122
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:53,830
Welcome back, Dr. Coleman.

123
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:56,330
What's going on? Where am I?

124
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:59,230
There was a gas leak

125
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:59,230
in your home. You and

126
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:59,230
your wife were brought here.

127
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:01,530
Phyllis. Where's Phyllis?

128
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:01,530
Yes, she's here.

129
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,230
I just need you to relax

130
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,230
for a moment.

131
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:05,330
Okay, no. I need you

132
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:05,330
to lie back down, okay?

133
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,640
Listen. Dr. Sexton's gonna

134
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,640
go check on your wife,

135
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,640
all right?

136
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:10,470
But I need you to just

137
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:10,470
stay calm for me, okay?

138
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:13,780
What's Ms. Coleman's status?

139
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:13,780
Couldn't revive her.

140
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:13,780
She's gone.

141
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:24,820
I'm so sorry.

142
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:29,900
No! Phyllis! Me! Take me!

143
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,360
No, Dr. Coleman, no.

144
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:32,760
All right. I need you

145
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:32,760
to take a deep breath.

146
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:34,270
No.

147
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:34,270
Sats are down to 88.

148
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:36,460
Shouldn't his sats

149
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:36,460
be coming up?

150
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:36,460
Yeah.

151
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:37,560
Maybe he aspirated?

152
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:38,800
Don't know,

153
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:38,800
something else is up.

154
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:40,380
All right. I'm intubating.

155
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:40,380
Let's go.

156
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,740
A hundred of sux,

157
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,740
20 of etomidate.

158
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,610
Come on! Laryngoscope!

159
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:54,550
Coffee for Charles?

160
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,520
Listen.

161
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,520
You're talking about

162
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,520
this morning, right?

163
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,450
Can you leave it

164
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,450
for a minute?

165
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,450
I'm at work.

166
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,720
I'm moving out.

167
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:08,590
Good morning.

168
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:08,590
Hey.

169
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:10,930
Ooh. You bought me a coffee?

170
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,030
Of course I did.

171
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:13,540
They spelled your name wrong.

172
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,730
Daniel?

173
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:18,340
You stole

174
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:18,340
somebody's coffee?

175
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:19,440
I left him five bucks.

176
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:20,850
He's an old friend of mine.

177
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,740
At least,

178
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,740
it's the way I like it.

179
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:26,410
I guess it's your lucky day.

180
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,820
Uh... Not so much.

181
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:33,390
Michael pissed me off

182
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:33,390
this morning, so, now,

183
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:33,390
he's sour with me.

184
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:37,690
Been back to work

185
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:37,690
one day, he's already

186
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:37,690
apartment hunting.

187
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:38,820
Huh.

188
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:43,000
I told him, I said,

189
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:43,000
stay put with me,

190
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:43,000
build a little nest egg.

191
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:46,340
You know, he's been

192
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:46,340
quarantining with me

193
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:46,340
since March.

194
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:50,070
You know,

195
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:50,070
what's a few more months?

196
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,470
What?

197
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:54,050
I don't know.

198
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:54,050
He's a grown man, right?

199
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:55,940
It's probably

200
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:55,940
a point of pride.

201
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:59,490
Please. I know Michael.

202
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:59,490
This is what he does.

203
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:01,320
He makes

204
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:01,320
impulsive decisions.

205
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:04,880
I'm all for him getting back

206
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:04,880
on his feet, but the ground's

207
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:04,880
got to be sturdy.

208
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:06,990
Fair enough.

209
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:11,620
Anyway, what's your day like?

210
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:11,620
Office hours?

211
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:15,500
Yeah. And, um,

212
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:15,500
mediation with Susan.

213
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:20,370
You mean she's really

214
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:20,370
serious about taking Anna

215
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:20,370
to Arizona with her?

216
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,600
Oh, she's serious.

217
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:25,400
And how does... How is Anna

218
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:25,400
taking this thing?

219
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:28,070
I mean, parents at odds...

220
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,720
Kids can feel like

221
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,720
they have to pick sides.

222
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:35,120
I think she's fine.

223
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:35,120
Yeah. She's fine.

224
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,890
And what were you

225
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,890
and lover boy

226
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,470
chatting about

227
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,470
this morning?

228
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,730
Crockett?

229
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,730
Yeah.

230
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:48,000
I was just asking

231
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:48,000
his advice on a patient.

232
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:51,930
Come here.

233
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:58,410
Okay.

234
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:00,670
I slept with him last night.

235
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:03,780
Nat! How was it?

236
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:07,920
It was good. It was fun.

237
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:07,920
Um, but before you

238
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:07,920
say anything, okay,

239
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:10,820
I am under no illusions.

240
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:10,820
I know Crockett's reputation.

241
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,490
I didn't think that was

242
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,490
your vibe, though.

243
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:16,090
It's not, but he's

244
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:16,090
got like this...

245
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:22,000
No! This other side to him.

246
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:22,000
All right. Okay.

247
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,870
Look, maybe I'm okay

248
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,870
keeping it casual.

249
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:25,070
All right?

250
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:25,070
Okay.

251
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:28,580
Anyway, enough about me.

252
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:28,580
How are you? How is Auggie?

253
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,080
We're supposed to get

254
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,080
his Heredity & Me

255
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,080
results back soon,

256
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:33,700
and see if he has

257
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:33,700
any relatives that

258
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:33,700
are willing to donate.

259
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:39,080
Man. That kid is so lucky

260
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:39,080
to have you in his corner.

261
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:39,080
You know that, right?

262
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:41,780
You really are

263
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:41,780
unshakeable, Mags.

264
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:41,780
Mmm.

265
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:45,920
Ugh.

266
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,130
I got my "highly encouraged,"

267
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:50,720
aka mandatory session

268
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:50,720
with Dr. Charles today.

269
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:51,990
Mmm. Fun.

270
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:53,690
Ugh.

271
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,790
Nat,

272
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:58,660
be careful. I don't want

273
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:58,660
to see you get hurt.

274
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,770
Thanks.

275
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:07,910
See, Mr. Booker, I thought

276
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:07,910
I told you

277
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,880
you were not allowed

278
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,880
back here.

279
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,450
Any excuse to see that smile.

280
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:15,750
Mr. Booker was my patient

281
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:15,750
in the COVID ward,

282
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:19,850
and he kicked COVID's ass,

283
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:19,850
so, he's not going anywhere.

284
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,060
Mr. Booker, hi,

285
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,060
I'm Dr. Halstead.

286
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,960
You're experiencing

287
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,960
some shortness of breath?

288
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:29,200
Yeah. Been totally bushed

289
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:29,200
these last few weeks, too.

290
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:29,200
Mmm-hmm.

291
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,870
Sure, it doesn't help me

292
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,870
working overtime.

293
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:34,030
The wedding, you know.

294
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,610
You getting hitched?

295
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:39,940
Me? Oh, no. But my daughter,

296
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:39,940
she's hopeless.

297
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,180
Too many romantic comedies.

298
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:45,090
Lean forward for me,

299
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:45,090
would you?

300
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,890
Huh.

301
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:54,690
What? Is it my lungs again?

302
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,160
I do hear some crackles.

303
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,160
It means you have fluid

304
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,160
in your chest.

305
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:01,570
Oh, God, this is what happened

306
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:01,570
before, right? With the COVID.

307
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:03,570
No, your swab was negative.

308
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:03,570
You don't have it again.

309
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:07,510
Is there some kind of

310
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:07,510
long-term damage? I thought

311
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:07,510
this was behind me, damn it.

312
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:10,510
Look, let's just let

313
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:10,510
Dr. Halstead run a few tests

314
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:12,600
before we get ahead

315
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:12,600
of ourselves, okay?

316
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:15,980
Now, Mr. Booker,

317
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:15,980
you just relax. We'll have

318
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:15,980
answers for you soon.

319
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:21,010
Sexton,

320
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:21,010
how's Dr. Coleman doing?

321
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,590
Oh, yeah. Just extubated him.

322
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,590
He's stable and resting.

323
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:24,850
Any of the tests up yet?

324
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,520
Affirmative.

325
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,520
Was just pulling them up.

326
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:28,650
Oh, wow.

327
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:32,260
Yeah. Explains why

328
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:32,260
he was decompensating

329
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,090
even after they removed him

330
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,090
from the home.

331
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:37,100
It wasn't gas poisoning.

332
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:37,100
Nope.

333
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:41,700
Hey, Dr. Coleman?

334
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:43,640
How're you feeling?

335
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:45,640
Anything we can do

336
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:45,640
to make you

337
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:45,640
more comfortable?

338
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,070
No.

339
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:49,310
Just wanted to say again,

340
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,020
how sorry we are

341
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,020
for your loss.

342
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:57,120
We'll let you rest, but while

343
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:57,120
it's still fresh in your mind,

344
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:59,630
is there anything that you

345
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:59,630
remember from this morning?

346
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:06,760
Not really. I just remember

347
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:06,760
sitting down in my chair.

348
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:13,570
And I must've dozed off.

349
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:13,570
I guess that's why I didn't

350
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:13,570
smell the gas.

351
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,040
Listen, can I go home soon?

352
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:20,170
I need to start

353
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:20,170
making arrangements

354
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:20,170
for my Phyllis.

355
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,770
Yeah, of course.

356
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,770
I understand.

357
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,820
But, uh,

358
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,820
before we can let you go,

359
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:28,150
we need to discuss

360
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:28,150
your blood work.

361
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:33,250
We found an extremely

362
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:33,250
high level of benzos

363
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:33,250
in your system.

364
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:37,260
Any idea how they got there?

365
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,130
Dr. Coleman?

366
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:45,660
This wasn't supposed

367
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:45,660
to happen like this.

368
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,810
Lisa wasn't supposed

369
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,810
to find us until tonight.

370
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:52,310
Lisa?

371
00:10:53,380 --> 00:11:00,250
Phyllis' caregiver.

372
00:10:53,380 --> 00:11:00,250
I hired her when Phyllis

373
00:10:53,380 --> 00:11:00,250
was diagnosed with ALS.

374
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:03,650
See, Phyllis was terrified

375
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:09,290
of ending up paralyzed

376
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:09,290
inside of her body.

377
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:12,960
She made me promise

378
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:12,960
that I wouldn't

379
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:12,960
let it happen.

380
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,040
But when the time

381
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,040
came to help her,

382
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:24,640
I knew I had to go, too.

383
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:31,920
You see, we come here

384
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:31,920
together from Jamaica.

385
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:35,290
Nineteen years of age.

386
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:43,820
I can't live

387
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:43,820
without my Phyllis!

388
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:58,680
So, if Mrs. Coleman

389
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:58,680
died of a drug overdose

390
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:58,680
and not gas poisoning,

391
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:01,770
then what about the gas leak?

392
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:01,770
It was just a coincidence?

393
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,980
Dr. Coleman created the leak

394
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,980
to protect the clinic.

395
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:07,080
He didn't want the way

396
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:07,080
in which they died

397
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:07,080
to negatively impact

398
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:08,780
the work they're doing

399
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:08,780
in the community.

400
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:09,880
Wow.

401
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,860
All right, thanks, guys.

402
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,860
I'll take it from here.

403
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,450
Wait, what do you mean?

404
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,790
I'll notify PD.

405
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:16,920
Oh, PD?

406
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,790
What? No!

407
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,890
Noah, I have to.

408
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,460
Maybe we could, uh...

409
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:24,030
What? Sweep this

410
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:24,030
under the rug?

411
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:28,440
Guys, we have a confession.

412
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,870
And in the eyes of the law,

413
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,870
this was murder.

414
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:32,140
It was assisted suicide.

415
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,270
Not if she didn't

416
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,270
put the pills

417
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,270
in her own mouth.

418
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,040
She couldn't.

419
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,040
She was incapacitated.

420
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,880
Which means

421
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,880
she couldn't consent.

422
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,480
And, besides, you know

423
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,480
assisted suicide

424
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,480
is illegal in Illinois.

425
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:42,050
Yeah, but she did consent.

426
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:43,950
She told him this is

427
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:43,950
what she wanted

428
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:43,950
years ago.

429
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:46,250
And they even

430
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:46,250
considered moving to

431
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:46,250
a state where it's legal.

432
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,060
I'm not passing judgment.

433
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,060
That's not my place.

434
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:52,360
But I have to

435
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:52,360
protect my staff.

436
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,210
If I don't report this,

437
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,210
we're obstructing justice.

438
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:04,110
Hold on,

439
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:04,110
this wasn't murder.

440
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:04,110
It was an act of mercy.

441
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:07,970
I'm sorry, Noah.

442
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:17,750
So, you and Ben

443
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:17,750
have had... You're having

444
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:17,750
quite a first year.

445
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:21,850
Mmm-hmm.

446
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:21,850
I mean, taking in Auggie,

447
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:21,850
and then, now, COVID.

448
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,490
I mean, that's a lot.

449
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:28,130
Actually, I think it's only

450
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:28,130
brought Ben and I closer.

451
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:31,070
That's good.

452
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:31,070
I mean, that's great.

453
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:38,370
I'm sorry, Dr. Charles.

454
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:38,370
Sorry to be wasting

455
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:38,370
your time,

456
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,510
but I don't think

457
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,510
this is for me.

458
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:44,420
I'm a Lockwood woman.

459
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:44,420
We handle things.

460
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:48,080
We don't spend a lot of time

461
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:48,080
sitting around and just...

462
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:49,790
Talkin' about your feelings.

463
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:55,130
My mom had two jobs

464
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:55,130
when my dad

465
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:55,130
was in grad school,

466
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,560
also while raising three kids

467
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,560
and caring for her parents,

468
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,140
both of whom

469
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,140
were wheelchair-bound.

470
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:01,530
Really?

471
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,230
Sounds like

472
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,230
a remarkable woman.

473
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:05,270
She was.

474
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:13,970
Look, Mags, I know that

475
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:13,970
this first one was mandatory,

476
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:13,970
but I'm here.

477
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:17,280
I mean, there's no shame

478
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:17,280
in unloading.

479
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:17,280
I do it all the time.

480
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:20,950
Thanks, I'll keep that

481
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:20,950
in mind, Dr. Charles.

482
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:24,820
Am I dismissed, Doc?

483
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:24,820
I want to make sure

484
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:24,820
the ED isn't on fire.

485
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:26,460
You are dismissed.

486
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:28,990
Thanks.

487
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,930
Why does he always have

488
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,930
to be such a hard-ass?

489
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:33,930
Look, I'm the first one

490
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:33,930
to give Ethan

491
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,590
a hard time when he's

492
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,590
being too rigid, but...

493
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:36,930
Don't tell me

494
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:36,930
you're on his side.

495
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,100
All we asked him to do

496
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,100
was look the other way.

497
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:40,270
But now, that he's chief,

498
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,540
I think

499
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,540
that's a bigger ask

500
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,540
than you realize.

501
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:45,270
To be continued.

502
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,280
Yup, I see it. All right.

503
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:52,480
Hey, Will. Did you

504
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:52,480
get Mr. Booker's

505
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:52,480
test results back yet?

506
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:54,550
I did.

507
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:57,250
I'm sorry, April,

508
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:57,250
he's in heart failure.

509
00:14:57,430 --> 00:15:00,090
What? He cannot

510
00:14:57,430 --> 00:15:00,090
catch a break.

511
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,960
First he beats COVID,

512
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,960
now this?

513
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:04,120
The truth is, the virus

514
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:04,120
may have actually caused,

515
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:05,960
or at least exacerbated,

516
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:05,960
the problem.

517
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:09,230
What about your

518
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:09,230
clinical trial? Can...

519
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:11,900
So, I thought about that

520
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:11,900
already, and unfortunately,

521
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,410
Mr. Booker's serum

522
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,410
creatinine is just above

523
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,410
the eligibility cutoff.

524
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,310
He doesn't qualify.

525
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:19,880
Thank you

526
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:19,880
for looking into it.

527
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:24,410
If you don't mind,

528
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:24,410
I'd like to break

529
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:24,410
the news with you.

530
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:26,150
Of course.

531
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:28,190
Let's go.

532
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:30,450
Dr. Manning.

533
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,650
Anna? Hey.

534
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:34,590
Owen was just asking

535
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:34,590
about you. He misses

536
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:34,590
having you babysit.

537
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:39,030
Yeah, me, too. Um, listen,

538
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:39,030
can we talk in private?

539
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:43,270
Of course. Let's go upstairs.

540
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:43,270
Does your dad know

541
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:43,270
you're here?

542
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:47,070
No, and, um, I'd really like

543
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:47,070
to keep it that way, please.

544
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,180
Okay. Let's go.

545
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,180
Okay.

546
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,010
So, how can

547
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,010
I help you, Anna?

548
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:53,640
Is everything okay?

549
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:55,380
Are you okay?

550
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:55,380
Yeah, I'm fine.

551
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,540
Um,

552
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,540
there's nothing like that.

553
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,540
I'm not in any kind

554
00:15:57,650 --> 00:15:59,990
of trouble or anything.

555
00:15:57,650 --> 00:15:59,990
I just...

556
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,950
Um...

557
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,580
I need birth control.

558
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:07,060
Okay, um...

559
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:10,100
Do you mind if I ask

560
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:10,100
why this is such

561
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:10,100
a covert operation?

562
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,390
'Cause of my mom, really.

563
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,470
I brought it up

564
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,470
to her once,

565
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,260
and of course

566
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,260
she shut it right down.

567
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:21,000
She doesn't even want me

568
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:21,000
to have a boyfriend,

569
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:21,000
much less... You know.

570
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:22,540
But what about your dad?

571
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:25,240
I'm sure he'd be

572
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:25,240
really happy to know

573
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:25,240
you're being responsible.

574
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:28,140
No, I do not want to talk

575
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:28,140
about it with my dad, yeah.

576
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:31,410
Me and my boyfriend,

577
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:31,410
we're ready.

578
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,550
You know, I just

579
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,550
want to be prepared.

580
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:36,490
Listen, I think it is great

581
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:39,990
that you want to take

582
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:39,990
precautions, and I do

583
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:39,990
want to help you.

584
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,150
This is the part

585
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,150
where you say, "but,"

586
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,600
you need

587
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,600
my parents' permission,

588
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,600
or something?

589
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:49,730
No, but after I take

590
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:49,730
your medical history

591
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:49,730
and your blood pressure,

592
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,670
I do need to run

593
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,670
some lab work.

594
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:53,460
Okay.

595
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:55,100
And that will trigger

596
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:55,100
your parents' insurance.

597
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:58,110
All right. Forget it,

598
00:16:58,210 --> 00:16:59,540
I'll just figure

599
00:16:58,210 --> 00:16:59,540
something out, it's fine.

600
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:02,580
You know, Anna, wait, look.

601
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:05,250
This is a big step.

602
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:09,280
But if you're sure,

603
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:09,280
you do need protection.

604
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:12,490
So, I'll run the labs

605
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:12,490
off the record.

606
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:14,690
Thank you, Dr. Manning.

607
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:19,690
How about

608
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:19,690
the possibility of

609
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:19,690
working remotely, Susan?

610
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,190
I'm leading

611
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,190
an entire department.

612
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,530
I have to be there

613
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,530
in person.

614
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:27,010
Daniel, what about you?

615
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:27,010
Is there

616
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:27,010
a custody arrangement

617
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:28,240
you'd feel

618
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:28,240
comfortable with,

619
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:31,010
that still allows Susan

620
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:31,010
and Anna to make the move?

621
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:34,480
Look, I'm not crazy about

622
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:34,480
disrupting Anna's school year,

623
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:37,020
but the real issue

624
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:37,020
is seeing my daughter.

625
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,450
It's why we made

626
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,450
an agreement to live within

627
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,450
100 miles of each other.

628
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:44,090
And I get that,

629
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:44,090
but life happens.

630
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,350
I can't pass up this job.

631
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:46,650
What about my job?

632
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,590
I mean, with my schedule,

633
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,490
flying back and forth

634
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,490
every other week,

635
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,570
it's unfeasible.

636
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:55,570
It's been about your job

637
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:55,570
for the last 20 years.

638
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:58,270
Look, it comes down

639
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:58,270
to a simple choice, right,

640
00:17:58,410 --> 00:17:59,810
either Anna moves with me,

641
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:02,770
or you get what you want

642
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:02,770
and you successfully

643
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:02,770
derail our lives.

644
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,670
I'm not trying

645
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,670
to derail anything,

646
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,670
all right?

647
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:07,580
It is in Anna's best interest

648
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:07,580
to have us both around.

649
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,110
Yeah, but when it

650
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,110
comes down to it, Daniel,

651
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:12,380
Anna needs me

652
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:12,380
more than she needs you.

653
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:16,450
The facts only,

654
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:16,450
let's avoid opinions,

655
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:16,450
please.

656
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:19,790
Okay, okay.

657
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:19,790
The fact is

658
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:22,790
that I've been doing

659
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:22,790
the heavy lifting

660
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:22,790
when he's been MIA.

661
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:26,530
When are you going to

662
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:26,530
get tired of beating

663
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:26,530
this deadbeat dad drum?

664
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:29,130
I've always been

665
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:29,130
a solid presence

666
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:29,130
in Anna's life,

667
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,230
and you know that.

668
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:33,710
I'm telling you, Daniel,

669
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:33,710
if you try to sabotage this

670
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:33,710
for me,

671
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:36,370
you will see a side of me

672
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:36,370
that you will not like.

673
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:37,530
Oh, I will see.

674
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:40,440
Classic.

675
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:42,710
Doesn't get what she wants,

676
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:42,710
and she disappears.

677
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:45,720
It's what she does. See?

678
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,790
I feel for the old man.

679
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,790
I actually went to that clinic

680
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,790
when I was a kid.

681
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:54,550
So, what happens now?

682
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,530
I've been in contact

683
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,530
with the state's attorney.

684
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:59,660
Flight risk isn't a concern,

685
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:59,660
so you do what you need

686
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:59,660
to do for him here.

687
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:02,100
Once he's ready for discharge,

688
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:02,100
we'll have to book him.

689
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:06,270
All right.

690
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,640
Hey, Trini,

691
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,640
mind giving us a sec?

692
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:19,450
I'm really sorry

693
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:19,450
about the police.

694
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:21,780
If it had been up to me...

695
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:21,780
It is what it is.

696
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,290
It's part of the job.

697
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,290
I know that.

698
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:26,120
Also, I, um...

699
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,730
I wanted to say thank you.

700
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:38,360
You're actually

701
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:38,360
a big part of the reason

702
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:38,360
I became a doctor.

703
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:42,230
Your clinic had this,

704
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:42,230
like, traveling tent

705
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:44,310
you'd pitch in parks

706
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:44,310
around the South Side.

707
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:46,570
Every Saturday morning.

708
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:46,570
One of those mornings,

709
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:50,450
my dad and I were kicking

710
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:50,450
around a soccer ball,

711
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:52,280
and you managed

712
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:52,280
to coax him inside.

713
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:56,450
He hadn't been

714
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:56,450
to the doctor in years.

715
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,220
His blood pressure

716
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,220
was sky high.

717
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:03,200
You made him promise

718
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:03,200
to follow up with his GP.

719
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:08,890
They found a pheochromocytoma

720
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:08,890
in his adrenal gland.

721
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:14,240
If you hadn't have gotten

722
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:14,240
that cuff on him...

723
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:15,930
You give me

724
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:15,930
far too much credit.

725
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,310
No. Your clinic

726
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,310
saved a lot of lives.

727
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:24,650
All praises go to my Phyllis.

728
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:26,910
Phyllis gave up everything

729
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,520
so that she could

730
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,520
help build it with me.

731
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:33,620
I only wish I could've

732
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:33,620
held up my end of the bargain.

733
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:35,390
What do you mean?

734
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,660
What you did for her,

735
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:41,530
it took courage.

736
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:41,530
I was a coward.

737
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:41,530
I couldn't let her go.

738
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:43,700
Even when I knew it was time.

739
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:47,930
I guess

740
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:47,930
this is my punishment.

741
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:52,580
My living without her.

742
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,720
There you are.

743
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,720
Hey.

744
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:08,660
So, has that "we'll see"

745
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:08,660
turned into a "yes" yet?

746
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,920
I'm sorry, Crockett. Um...

747
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:15,330
I don't think

748
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:15,330
tonight's gonna work.

749
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:17,460
Did I do something wrong?

750
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:18,600
No.

751
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:19,730
You sure?

752
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:23,370
Because now, I'm getting

753
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:23,370
the distinct vibe that

754
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:23,370
you're blowing me off.

755
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:26,000
I'm sorry, I don't

756
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:26,000
mean it that way.

757
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:30,540
I think I just need

758
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:30,540
a little space to think

759
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:30,540
about some things.

760
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:34,610
Okay.

761
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:39,550
Will.

762
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:43,560
Great news.

763
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:45,920
I looked into Mr. Booker's

764
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:45,920
medical records,

765
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:50,030
and it turns out, he's always

766
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:50,030
had high serum creatinine,

767
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:54,330
but never showed

768
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:54,330
any signs of reduced

769
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:54,330
kidney function or disease...

770
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,930
Yeah, it's just part of

771
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,930
his natural physiology.

772
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:01,380
It's well-documented

773
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:01,380
that black men often have

774
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:01,380
higher serum creatinine,

775
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:04,420
even when their

776
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:04,420
kidneys are functioning

777
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:04,420
perfectly normally.

778
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,880
Which means

779
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:07,920
that shouldn't preclude him

780
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:07,920
from joining

781
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:07,920
the clinical trial.

782
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:11,320
You're not jumping for joy.

783
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:15,830
Listen, April,

784
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:15,830
the exclusion criteria

785
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:15,830
aren't exactly flexible.

786
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:17,630
Why not?

787
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:20,430
The criteria are designed

788
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:20,430
to protect the participants

789
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,070
and prevent

790
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,070
any adverse effects.

791
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,740
If Mr. Booker's kidneys

792
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,740
are functioning normally,

793
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:27,970
he shouldn't be

794
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:27,970
at any greater risk.

795
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:27,970
Yes.

796
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,810
But it's also imperative

797
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,810
that every participant

798
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,810
meet the same qualifications

799
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,950
in order to protect

800
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,950
the data...

801
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,950
"Protect the data"?

802
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:39,580
I'm sorry.

803
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:39,580
At whose expense?

804
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:44,880
Tell me,

805
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:44,880
what percentage of your

806
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:44,880
participants are black?

807
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:49,420
I don't have

808
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:49,420
the numbers offhand, um...

809
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:51,100
Yeah, I think around 3%?

810
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:54,890
Only 3%

811
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:54,890
because of biases like this.

812
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:59,570
And yet, we are 30%

813
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:59,570
more likely to die

814
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:59,570
from heart failure.

815
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:02,440
April, I'm sorry, I just...

816
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:04,480
I'm not sure

817
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:04,480
what you want me to do.

818
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:08,610
Nothing, apparently.

819
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:08,610
Just like everyone else.

820
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:16,780
Hey.

821
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:17,980
I'm just texting

822
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:17,980
my boyfriend.

823
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:21,390
He said it's so cool

824
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:21,390
that you're gonna

825
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:21,390
help us out.

826
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,090
Um, why don't you

827
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,090
take a seat.

828
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:25,100
Okay.

829
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:31,400
So, uh, after getting back

830
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:31,400
your initial test results,

831
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:33,800
I'm afraid that, um,

832
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:36,400
birth control would not be

833
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:36,400
recommended for you.

834
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:38,410
Why?

835
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:40,540
You're pregnant.

836
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:46,950
What? I...

837
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:46,950
How could this happen?

838
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:48,420
Ryan and I

839
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:48,420
only had sex once. I...

840
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,510
It's okay.

841
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:52,790
There's got to have

842
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:52,790
been some kind of mistake.

843
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:52,790
Can you run the test again?

844
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:54,520
I ran the test twice already.

845
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:56,890
Okay, it's possible that

846
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:56,890
the condom you used broke,

847
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:59,520
or maybe it wasn't

848
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:59,520
put on properly.

849
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:00,660
God, no, no, no.

850
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:03,500
Anna. Anna,

851
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:03,500
look at me. Hey.

852
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:07,670
This is a lot to absorb

853
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:07,670
on your own.

854
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,940
Now, might be a good time

855
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,940
to loop in your mom and dad.

856
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,410
No. You cannot

857
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,410
tell my parents.

858
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:16,750
Listen, I cannot and

859
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:16,750
I won't share any information

860
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:16,750
without your consent,

861
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,720
but I do want you to

862
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,720
seriously think about it.

863
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:19,910
God.

864
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:22,710
Look, there is

865
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:22,710
some information

866
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:22,710
I want to get you.

867
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:24,520
I'll try not to be

868
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:24,520
too long, okay?

869
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:34,000
Hey, how's Dr. Coleman?

870
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,760
Think he's ready

871
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,760
to be discharged?

872
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:37,000
Nope.

873
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,970
What's the rush?

874
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:40,630
Come on, Noah.

875
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:43,040
Don't make this

876
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:43,040
personal, man.

877
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:43,040
Oh, personal?

878
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:45,610
We still got to take care

879
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:45,610
of Dr. Coleman's head lac.

880
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:49,710
All right. I'll let PD know

881
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:49,710
he'll be ready

882
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:49,710
within the hour.

883
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:55,480
Sorry, Noah, but it's out

884
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:55,480
of our control now.

885
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:01,090
Dr. Marcel,

886
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:01,090
everything okay?

887
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,690
Yeah, um...

888
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,660
Listen, let's, uh...

889
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:08,960
Let's go ahead and stitch

890
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:08,960
him up now, gotta head home,

891
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:08,960
personal matter.

892
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:11,700
If you need to go,

893
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:11,700
I've got Dr. Coleman.

894
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,070
You sure?

895
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,070
Of course.

896
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:14,940
Thanks, brother.

897
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:24,140
Draw up lidocaine with epi.

898
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:41,100
You know,

899
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:41,100
I need a bigger suture.

900
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,570
I'll grab it.

901
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,570
No, no, I'll get it.

902
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,570
I know what I need.

903
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:53,210
I'll be right back.

904
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,210
Okay.

905
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:22,040
No, Dr. Coleman!

906
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:25,540
No! Ow! Dr. Sexton!

907
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:31,950
I'm sorry, he grabbed it

908
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:31,950
before I could...

909
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,260
What's going on?

910
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,260
He's in v-fib.

911
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,260
No pulse.

912
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,880
Doris, charge to 200.

913
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:39,290
Noah, get on his chest.

914
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:40,580
What the hell happened?

915
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:41,860
He grabbed the syringe,

916
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,060
injected himself

917
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,060
with 10 CCs of lidocaine.

918
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,070
Charged.

919
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,070
Clear!

920
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:50,690
He's asystolic.

921
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,640
Amp of epi. Resume CPR.

922
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:54,260
Ethan...

923
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:54,260
I said resume CPR.

924
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,350
Where's that epi?

925
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,350
It's coming.

926
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:04,850
Epi's in.

927
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:07,110
Hold compressions.

928
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:17,360
Come on.

929
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:17,360
It's time to call it.

930
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:26,040
Time of death, 16:52.

931
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:42,380
Walk me through it again,

932
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:42,380
from the beginning.

933
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:44,990
I told you.

934
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:46,720
I set down the syringe,

935
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:48,920
went to grab the suture

936
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:48,920
and when I turned...

937
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:52,630
You set it down

938
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:52,630
within arm's reach

939
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:52,630
of a suicidal patient.

940
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:55,660
A patient with

941
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:55,660
the medical knowledge

942
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:55,660
to know how to use it.

943
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:58,800
It was a mistake.

944
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:58,800
You gotta write me up.

945
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:02,210
I get it. Go ahead.

946
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:04,900
I know you.

947
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:06,780
I taught you, Noah.

948
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:11,980
You don't make mistakes.

949
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,880
You sympathized with

950
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,880
Dr. Coleman, didn't think

951
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,880
we should call the police.

952
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,420
You did this on purpose, man.

953
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,420
What were you thinking?

954
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:25,030
Dr. Coleman had the right

955
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:25,030
to die on his own terms.

956
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:25,030
Man, come on, Ethan.

957
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:27,330
You really think

958
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:27,330
he deserved

959
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:27,330
to rot in prison?

960
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:28,830
It doesn't matter

961
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:28,830
what I think.

962
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:31,260
The minute

963
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:31,260
you called the police,

964
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:31,260
you buried him.

965
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:32,900
You think

966
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:32,900
it was easy for me

967
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:32,900
to make that call?

968
00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:34,000
Yeah, it sure

969
00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:34,000
seemed like it.

970
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:35,800
Just stop, man.

971
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:35,800
This isn't about me

972
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:37,840
or Dr. Coleman anymore,

973
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:37,840
don't you get that?

974
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:42,410
Now, when the police

975
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:42,410
walk through that door,

976
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:45,820
I'm gonna have to

977
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:45,820
tell them what you did.

978
00:28:58,770 --> 00:28:59,960
You got a second?

979
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:01,470
Yeah, come in.

980
00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:04,140
Sharon, do you know

981
00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:04,140
a good family attorney?

982
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:07,200
Oh, the mediation

983
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:07,200
went that well, huh?

984
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:08,330
Afraid so.

985
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,340
I'm sorry, Daniel,

986
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,340
but, yes, I actually do.

987
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:14,710
Peter Kalmick's husband.

988
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:17,480
I really don't want

989
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:17,480
to go down this road,

990
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:17,480
you know, but, um...

991
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:21,780
You exhausted all of

992
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:21,780
your options, you gotta do

993
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:21,780
what you gotta do.

994
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:25,190
I remember when Anna,

995
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:25,190
she first moved back

996
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:25,190
to Chicago,

997
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:27,450
you know, it took

998
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:27,450
a little adjusting.

999
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,490
I mean, I don't need

1000
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,490
to tell you, I can be

1001
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,490
a little set in my ways.

1002
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:35,290
"Cemented"

1003
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:35,290
is the word I'd use.

1004
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,930
Right. But now,

1005
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,930
when I have her,

1006
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:41,370
it's like we found

1007
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:41,370
this little, uh, routine.

1008
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:46,810
Mmm.

1009
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:46,810
I pick up the takeout,

1010
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:46,810
she sets the table...

1011
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:48,010
On a rare occasion,

1012
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,080
even though it can be

1013
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,080
like pulling teeth,

1014
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:51,780
I actually get her

1015
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:51,780
to tell me about her day.

1016
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:57,220
Now, when I think back

1017
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:57,220
to my old life...

1018
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:59,960
Mmm. Seems empty now.

1019
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:02,220
I don't even know what

1020
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:02,220
I used to do with myself.

1021
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,960
I know a thing

1022
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,960
or two about that.

1023
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:05,090
Yeah, I bet.

1024
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,030
So, who picks up the takeout,

1025
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,030
you or Michael?

1026
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:11,340
I cook.

1027
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:11,340
He does the dishes.

1028
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,360
Sounds like

1029
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,360
a pretty nice setup.

1030
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:20,540
Anyway, um,

1031
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:20,540
you reach out to Peter for me,

1032
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:20,540
just give him my number.

1033
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:23,110
Sure thing.

1034
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:23,110
Great. Thank you.

1035
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:30,990
Hey, Doris.

1036
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:30,990
It says in Mr. Booker's chart

1037
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:30,990
that you gave him fluids?

1038
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,820
Yeah, Dr. Halstead

1039
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,820
put in the order.

1040
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:34,360
He said he suspected

1041
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:34,360
dehydration.

1042
00:30:34,490 --> 00:30:36,020
But his electrolytes

1043
00:30:34,490 --> 00:30:36,020
were normal.

1044
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,130
Mmm.

1045
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,130
Okay.

1046
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:45,090
Oh, April, good.

1047
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:45,090
Just about to come find you.

1048
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:48,300
I re-tested Mr. Booker's

1049
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:48,300
serum creatinine, since it was

1050
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:48,300
so close to the cutoff.

1051
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:49,570
Yeah?

1052
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:51,340
Yeah, it turns out

1053
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:51,340
the initial test was wrong.

1054
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,450
He's within

1055
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,450
the acceptable range.

1056
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,450
He's gonna join the trial.

1057
00:30:56,580 --> 00:31:01,390
You gave him fluids

1058
00:30:56,580 --> 00:31:01,390
to dilute his creatinine.

1059
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,590
You gamed the test.

1060
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:08,590
I know it's not

1061
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:08,590
the overall fix

1062
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:08,590
you were looking for.

1063
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,890
It isn't.

1064
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,890
But with the next one,

1065
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:13,300
we will get it right,

1066
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:13,300
I promise you that.

1067
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:15,100
Thank you, Will.

1068
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,200
No, thank you.

1069
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:31,050
Noah. Noah, what's wrong?

1070
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:38,010
Yeah?

1071
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,860
Oh, hey.

1072
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:41,390
Maggie,

1073
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:41,390
Ben's on the line.

1074
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:44,860
Oh. Okay.

1075
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:44,860
I'll take it over here.

1076
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:47,560
Hey, honey.

1077
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:50,070
Oh, really? That was fast.

1078
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:53,270
Oh.

1079
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:55,940
No, no, no.

1080
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:00,210
No, I'll be fine.

1081
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:00,210
I should get back to work.

1082
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:02,970
Yeah, love you, too.

1083
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:06,110
Bad news?

1084
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:11,010
Yeah, Auggie's

1085
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:11,010
Hereditary & Me results.

1086
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:13,660
They didn't turn up

1087
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:13,660
any relatives.

1088
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,160
Oh, Mags.

1089
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,970
You'll find a way,

1090
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,970
you always do.

1091
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:23,030
You're the strongest woman

1092
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:23,030
I know.

1093
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:27,360
Would you stop?

1094
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:27,360
I'm not invincible.

1095
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:29,000
Or whatever it is

1096
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:29,000
that you think.

1097
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,680
Mm...

1098
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:37,010
Ethan, you know

1099
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:37,010
the stakes for Noah.

1100
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:40,150
He could lose his residency,

1101
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:40,150
his medical license,

1102
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,120
maybe even face

1103
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,120
criminal charges.

1104
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:44,590
Noah should've thought

1105
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:44,590
about that before he acted.

1106
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:47,460
Even if he did

1107
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:47,460
what you suspect,

1108
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:50,000
what if he felt it was

1109
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:50,000
an act of compassion?

1110
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:54,170
It is not worth

1111
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:54,170
destroying everything

1112
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:57,700
that he has worked for,

1113
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:57,700
everything you helped him

1114
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:57,700
work for.

1115
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:02,100
I understand.

1116
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,500
He's put you

1117
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,500
in an impossible position.

1118
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:08,580
But...

1119
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:08,580
But what?

1120
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:12,350
Lie to the police?

1121
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:18,730
I can't.

1122
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:18,730
Please. Please.

1123
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:23,600
If you won't do it for him,

1124
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:23,600
do it for me.

1125
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:41,980
All right, seems like the team

1126
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:41,980
did everything they could.

1127
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,640
I got everything I need.

1128
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:46,020
Anything else

1129
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:46,020
I should know, Dr. Choi?

1130
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,660
No. That's the account.

1131
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:57,090
Copy that.

1132
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:57,090
I think we're good.

1133
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:09,410
You're fired

1134
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:09,410
for negligence.

1135
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:09,410
What?

1136
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:11,240
You won't get reported

1137
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:11,240
to the medical board,

1138
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:14,510
and you can file

1139
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:14,510
for a new residency

1140
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:14,510
somewhere else.

1141
00:34:14,650 --> 00:34:18,020
No. Ethan,

1142
00:34:14,650 --> 00:34:18,020
just wait a second.

1143
00:34:14,650 --> 00:34:18,020
Don't...

1144
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:20,520
If it had been anyone else...

1145
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:36,690
Chocolate bar for dinner,

1146
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:36,690
Dr. Charles?

1147
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:42,540
Been that kind of day.

1148
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:42,540
You?

1149
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:46,540
I got some bad news.

1150
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:48,200
Sorry to hear that.

1151
00:34:49,650 --> 00:34:51,520
But it's fine.

1152
00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:53,520
It's going to be fine.

1153
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:58,480
Don't give me that look.

1154
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:58,480
What look?

1155
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:02,590
That thing we were

1156
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:02,590
talking about this morning.

1157
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:06,700
I think I wear

1158
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:06,700
my strength like

1159
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:09,260
a badge of honor.

1160
00:35:10,570 --> 00:35:12,330
Something passed down to me.

1161
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:14,770
From your mother?

1162
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:18,170
And her mother,

1163
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:18,170
and her mother's mother.

1164
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:23,280
Navigating through

1165
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:23,280
this world as a woman,

1166
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:27,380
a black woman.

1167
00:35:27,490 --> 00:35:28,480
Hmm.

1168
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:30,780
You get a thick skin.

1169
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:35,130
Necessary armor.

1170
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:42,600
But it sometimes also feels

1171
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:42,600
like it's an expectation

1172
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:42,600
that people have of me.

1173
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:48,300
Like I'm not allowed to

1174
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:48,300
have a vulnerable moment.

1175
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,580
A heavy burden

1176
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,580
to carry, Mags.

1177
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:02,310
It's just, I don't...

1178
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:05,220
I don't want to let

1179
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:05,220
anybody down,

1180
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:08,320
and I don't want to let

1181
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:08,320
that little boy down.

1182
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:11,120
I know.

1183
00:36:21,370 --> 00:36:22,900
Noah, stop it. Okay?

1184
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:25,770
We will figure something out.

1185
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:25,770
I'm gonna help you fight this.

1186
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:29,250
No, you're not.

1187
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:29,250
Because I'm not

1188
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:29,250
gonna fight it.

1189
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:33,180
Noah.

1190
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:33,180
I stand by what

1191
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:33,180
I did today, April.

1192
00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:37,590
And if I have to go up

1193
00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:37,590
against Ethan,

1194
00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:37,590
I'll end up having to lie.

1195
00:36:37,690 --> 00:36:38,920
I don't want to do that.

1196
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:44,390
You have worked

1197
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:44,390
so hard to get here.

1198
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:48,230
Hey, maybe

1199
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:48,230
the change of scenery

1200
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:48,230
might be good for me

1201
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:50,460
and you.

1202
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:55,430
Ever since we were kids,

1203
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:55,430
you've always

1204
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:55,430
had my back, April.

1205
00:36:57,510 --> 00:37:01,470
As long as I'm here,

1206
00:36:57,510 --> 00:37:01,470
you're always gonna

1207
00:36:57,510 --> 00:37:01,470
feel responsible for me.

1208
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:10,260
So, what now?

1209
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:17,190
Remember Dr. Kantwell,

1210
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:17,190
our med school advisor?

1211
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:20,600
She always said she can

1212
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:20,600
get me into a residency

1213
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:20,600
program at her hospital.

1214
00:37:20,770 --> 00:37:22,700
Isn't she in Atlanta?

1215
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,830
You're just gonna

1216
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,830
up and leave?

1217
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:24,930
I'll be back.

1218
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:29,770
Figure when I finish,

1219
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:29,770
maybe I'll go work

1220
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:29,770
for Coleman's clinic.

1221
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,570
Try to pick up

1222
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,570
where he left off.

1223
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:34,210
Okay.

1224
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:36,740
I'm gonna miss you.

1225
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:41,810
I already miss you.

1226
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,590
Hey.

1227
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,590
I thought I was

1228
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,590
picking you up.

1229
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:53,720
Uh, I got dropped off.

1230
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:53,720
Listen, can...

1231
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:55,800
I really need to talk

1232
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:55,800
to you about something.

1233
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:56,960
Yeah, sure.

1234
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:02,600
Dan, hey, I hear

1235
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:02,600
you're looking for

1236
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:02,600
a child custody lawyer.

1237
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:04,730
I'll call you tomorrow, okay?

1238
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,610
Uh, yeah, sure. Sorry.

1239
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,710
Sorry about that, honey.

1240
00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:16,620
So, what did you

1241
00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:16,620
want to talk about?

1242
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:19,260
Nothing.

1243
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:21,360
You sure?

1244
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:21,360
Yeah, no, uh...

1245
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:23,960
It wasn't important.

1246
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:26,290
Well, let's get

1247
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:26,290
out of here.

1248
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:26,290
Yeah.

1249
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,740
Okay, what are we doing, Ma?

1250
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,740
Michael, wait a second.

1251
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:40,370
About this morning...

1252
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:40,370
Look, Ma,

1253
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,780
I really don't want

1254
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,780
to get into it again.

1255
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:46,350
I already said my piece.

1256
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:46,350
Yes, and I hear you.

1257
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:47,890
You do?

1258
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:47,890
Yes.

1259
00:38:48,450 --> 00:38:50,980
I still don't think

1260
00:38:48,450 --> 00:38:50,980
it's the best decision

1261
00:38:48,450 --> 00:38:50,980
financially...

1262
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:54,320
Yeah, you made that

1263
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:54,320
very clear.

1264
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:54,320
But the truth is,

1265
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:56,660
that wasn't

1266
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:56,660
my primary objection.

1267
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:01,290
Son...

1268
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:04,400
I've gotten used

1269
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:04,400
to having you around.

1270
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:07,370
Mom, I'm only moving

1271
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:07,370
a few blocks away.

1272
00:39:07,770 --> 00:39:11,680
I know, but the thought

1273
00:39:07,770 --> 00:39:11,680
of coming home at night,

1274
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:15,640
and you not being there...

1275
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:17,720
Is that what

1276
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:17,720
all this is about?

1277
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:19,380
You missing me?

1278
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:22,780
Okay. All right.

1279
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:22,780
I'm gonna miss you, too, Ma,

1280
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:22,780
okay?

1281
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:25,480
Hey.

1282
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:28,560
Oh, come on, get off me.

1283
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:31,930
You know, when I moved in,

1284
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:31,930
I swear we were

1285
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:31,930
gonna kill each other.

1286
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:34,520
But quarantining with you

1287
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:34,520
hasn't been half bad.

1288
00:39:37,770 --> 00:39:41,370
You better

1289
00:39:37,770 --> 00:39:41,370
not be a stranger.

1290
00:39:37,770 --> 00:39:41,370
I'm gonna be by plenty.

1291
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:42,870
You know you keep

1292
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:42,870
the good wine.

1293
00:39:43,010 --> 00:39:46,040
That's right.

1294
00:39:43,010 --> 00:39:46,040
Take me home.

1295
00:39:43,010 --> 00:39:46,040
Yeah! All right.

1296
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,620
Natalie?

1297
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,620
Hi.

1298
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,790
Here, come in.

1299
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,790
Okay.

1300
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:05,900
Listen, you should know...

1301
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:05,900
No, before you say

1302
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:05,900
anything, um, I just...

1303
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:10,830
I wanted to say that earlier

1304
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:10,830
when I said I needed space,

1305
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:12,460
it wasn't about you.

1306
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:15,910
I was so caught up

1307
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:15,910
in wondering

1308
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:15,910
what people would think

1309
00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:18,380
about this, about us,

1310
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:21,850
and I don't even know

1311
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:21,850
what "us" is,

1312
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:25,580
but, um,

1313
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:25,580
all I do know is that...

1314
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:29,520
Whatever this is,

1315
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:29,520
I don't want it to end.

1316
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:30,820
Natalie, I don't...

1317
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:41,130
Sorry, I didn't know.

1318
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:45,170
Uh, Natalie,

1319
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:45,170
this is Claire, my ex-wife.

1320
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:45,170
I was trying to tell you.

1321
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:47,740
Hi.

1322
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:47,740
Nice to meet you.

1323
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:49,470
Nice to meet you.

1324
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:51,510
Uh, Claire, she sold

1325
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:51,510
her house in New Orleans,

1326
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,170
packed up a few things

1327
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,170
she thought I might want,

1328
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,810
just came by

1329
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,810
to drop them off.

1330
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,810
I'm sorry.

1331
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:57,820
I should've called...

1332
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:57,820
I was just

1333
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:57,820
getting ready to leave.

1334
00:40:58,550 --> 00:41:01,650
You don't have to leave.

1335
00:40:58,550 --> 00:41:01,650
No, it's okay,

1336
00:40:58,550 --> 00:41:01,650
I'll let you two...

1337
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,980
I'll see you at work. Bye.
